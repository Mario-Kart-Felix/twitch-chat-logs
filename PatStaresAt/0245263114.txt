[0:23:43] <El_Samio> a statue showcasing his ABS
[0:23:44] <%spacekataz18> Grineer are dope
[0:23:44] <+AntithesisEK> @AngriestPat Don't know if anyone's told you but mobility mods like Mobilize and Firewalker add a lot of speed to your bullet jumps. Well worth using as filler mods.
[0:23:45] <GoldeNOVA> Grineer are great
[0:23:46] <%Aldurin_> nobody wants to like Konami
[0:23:46] <tangoragahn> You know not of Grofit

[0:24:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> if its a hek I demand Pat buy that multishot aug
[0:24:27] <%YabbaTroll> you are playing an invincibility frame
[0:24:27] <elementofloyalty> Too much lagging in this game
[0:24:30] <%Dingus_Tickler> @AntithesisEK By the way, were bullet jumps nerfed last year? I feel they were way more faster back in late 2016. It's probably because I haven't played in such a long time
[0:24:31] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> I fucking hate the invincibility phases.
[0:24:31] <ape_hawk> would you say they have...Invincibility WARframes?!
[0:24:32] <+Nephthyz> Well, Pat doesn't know how to swim.
[0:24:32] <Bailey__gaming> I wish I knew what I was doing in this game, I'm trying to unlock things but I dunno how
[0:24:32] <sjcodan> Why does your hek have 6 shots, you filthy heathen
[0:24:33] <MC_GigglePants> To be fair, Rhino also has "invincibility frames" lol
[0:24:34] <+Nephthyz> So I bet he will.
[0:24:35] <Carlyle999> Invincibility warframes
[0:24:38] <%spacekataz18> Ye they started adding that kinda way back when
[0:24:38] <@PlagueOfGripes> he's not as cartoonish as Vay Hek but at least his boss fight isn't ass
[0:24:39] <$SGrim> He's Rhino Prime and is complaining about invincibility LUL
[0:24:40] <KTDelgado> yea thats called a boss remake
[0:24:46] <+AntithesisEK> mmm I don't think so Dingus

[0:29:17] <+MaeBae94> I just got here, is Pat being an embarrassment again?

[0:29:41] <elementofloyalty> this game...
[0:29:42] <El_Samio> hey, Rhino is a 400 pound bodybuilder ninja, he's pretty slow
[0:29:43] <Worldbrand> He's not wrong
[0:29:48] <smellmycowbro> "I am going to take this slow..."
[0:29:48] <@kizaru232> how far into the quest is he?
[0:29:49] <+Octumn> Cause you're just scanning here
[0:29:52] <startadevy> cosplay[
[0:29:56] <%Dingus_Tickler> Only good time to play slow is when you do shit like running Equinox with 24/7 Maim 4Head
[0:29:56] <+migofrompluto> Someone should get him to try Cernos Prime. Very fun bow!
[0:29:57] <+QuadraticGravity> @kizaru232 Just started a prereq for SD
[0:29:57] <+Sinoc229> The requirements to unlick the quest used to be diffrent
[0:29:58] <tangoragahn> Sparring weapons ftw
[0:29:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> if you hold airglide, you can tap slide for extra speed
[0:30:00] <%ssaryn> @kizaru232 2nd part of Natah
[0:30:00] <@thenefftw> @kizaru232 Just started
[0:30:00] <+MrMcCrabby> its almost like theyre figuring it out as they go

[0:30:07] <megamonmon123> So warframe is wow but with better string?
[0:30:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wew
[0:30:09] <+Nephthyz> Wait, Woolie is playing Warframe now?
[0:30:10] <mannywatcha> Look at them dance mooves!
[0:30:10] <jagchan> oh shit thats cool
[0:30:11] <Flunkorg> Does anyone know if Pat is working towards getting the Clan mod for Hek?
[0:30:11] <neuroticbiotic> String and paper clips
[0:30:12] <+MajorCrasher> MUDA MUDA MUDA
[0:30:16] <@thenefftw> Woolie loves the fist
[0:30:19] <Gorgen> h8terfiston8er?
[0:30:22] <%Dingus_Tickler> Woolie loves fisting
[0:30:22] <neuroticbiotic> ORA
[0:30:23] <%Ele_On_A_Uni> it's fuckin breaker style :V
[0:30:24] <$PonyHearts> No fisting for Woolie.
[0:30:25] <Matermind0> Man I wish I had the combo card for that
[0:30:26] <+AXL808> It's held together with string, duct tape, and gum
[0:30:27] <+TeethMuncher> How dare you deny a master fister?
[0:30:27] <elementofloyalty> git thu fuck outta mu ya
[0:30:28] <%ssaryn> Woolie loves apatBig Rubber Fists.
[0:30:29] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Woolie is going to cosplay Atlas as Crazy D and punch the ground to make a wall of rocks
[0:30:30] <startadevy> OH
[0:30:31] <tangoragahn> Fist weapons pale in comparison to Sparring
[0:30:32] <@thenefftw> Berserker would make this so much faster
[0:30:32] <Goldteddy> Woolie wants to get those hands!
[0:30:37] <+nepwar> thats his stance tho
[0:30:40] <TheKingBroseidon> if the scan sound still happens but it's just after killing the enemy, does it still scan?
[0:30:42] <+migofrompluto> Who doesn't love pinning motherfuckers to walls 50 feet off the ground?
[0:30:44] <elementofloyalty> They are not attacking pat so does he attack?
[0:30:44] <sunny935> front finisher for sparring is just so damn good
[0:30:46] <AtlasMcCoy> @nyseoul85 To put it into some perspective. To get a new warframe, you need to fight various bosses for different parts of a warframe, each requiring resources you farm as well as hours of waiting to craft, Then the warframe itself requires 72 hours of waiting to craft.
[0:30:48] <Flunkorg> Isn't it Pat who loves the rubber fists?
[0:30:48] <%InkblotBlues> So big. So stronk.
[0:30:49] <Shwepie> Punch them right in their non-existant dicks.
[0:30:51] <+Confused_4K> Hyper fisting action
[0:30:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> thats hot

[0:30:59] <smellmycowbro> HOW DOES IT FEEL TO GET FISTED?
[0:31:00] <%Dingus_Tickler> Non-stop Fisting Action
[0:31:02] <+dankdirtydan> what level is pat right now?
[0:31:05] <Zombrocom> @AngriestPat There is a story behind that. Warframe used to just be a bunch of nodes and quests scattered about with no real progression paths. The whole progression line, quest order, and the whole relay mechanic was added about a year ago to tie it all together, that's why some things are like that
[0:31:05] <elementofloyalty> @peachsaliva enjoys the rubber fist.
[0:31:07] <%Dingus_Tickler> Infinite Combo Fisting
[0:31:10] <+AXL808> Good boy, Helios
[0:31:11] <+TeethMuncher> Is this the new Yakuza?

[0:33:56] <+Sticky80sbaby> NO SMOILERS
[0:33:56] <grayjammer> Poppin' off Corpus helmets is so satisfying
[0:33:59] <elementofloyalty> Cheat Pat cheat
[0:34:03] <%TaifuDragon> Corpus are the only ones that deploy drones
[0:34:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> M O M M Y
[0:34:08] <%TaifuDragon> That's basically it
[0:34:10] <+MajorCrasher> @plagueofgripes 100% true
[0:34:14] <AtlasMcCoy> But if its not space incest then what's the point?
[0:34:15] <Flunkorg> The Corpus are 40k levels of religious
[0:34:20] <KTDelgado> @plagueofgripes whens the wf porn kek
[0:34:22] <$FriedMattato> How much has Pat spent on platinum so far?
[0:34:22] <+AXL808> velvet goodness
[0:34:25] <elementofloyalty> Purple like Twilight Sparkle
[0:34:26] <$SGrim> @PlagueOfGripes speaking of, have you done any Lotus art? And if not, do you plan to?
[0:34:28] <Maverick2736> Thank god he's not reading chat... twitch chat always spoils everything.
[0:34:29] <Flunkorg> Its just for them, instead of a god emporer, its money
[0:34:30] <Gorgen> $100
[0:34:36] <+AXL808> at least $100
[0:34:38] <+Dasbubba> @friedmattato about $100
[0:34:39] <El_Samio> Helios so good, Helios Primo is even better
[0:34:39] <%Dingus_Tickler> It's an Oculyst
[0:34:40] <+Nephthyz> Valkyr is cuter than Lotus. Fight me.

[0:34:57] <+AXL808> but then again that $100 was like free money because of the coupon
[0:34:58] <mannywatcha> Duh fuck outta here.
[0:35:00] <%Dingus_Tickler> Last time I remember Lotus is thick
[0:35:01] <%InkblotBlues> When Space Mom is scared, you should be scared.

[0:35:42] <elementofloyalty> Faster than even MAT?
[0:35:43] <MC_GigglePants> Well Pat is playing Big Boi Prime

[0:36:02] <Sunstalker> @AngriestPat They're Predators with STANDS LUL
[0:36:03] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> The predator but with a unlimited arsenal and fucking magic
[0:36:03] <Flunkorg> Errr, no... your not the biggest, baddest tenno ever. Every single player is cannon as far as the story is concerned.
[0:36:04] <Worldbrand> If he does get stuck, tell him about /unstuck
[0:36:04] <%ssaryn> How does Pat always manage to find broken shit
[0:36:05] <cizal11> warframe is still in open beta
[0:36:06] <mannywatcha> Oh that was pretty close to getting stuck.

[0:36:15] <+preppyposs> lmao
[0:36:15] <tangoragahn> Does Pat know the power of /unstuck?
[0:36:15] <+Kirbachev> @LORDSPOOKLEKINS I should know, I run her constantly. Even in Spy missions. Nothing like seeing randoms freak when I 4 through the security lasers and still get the objective :^)
[0:36:18] <$SGrim> HAHAHAHAHA LUL
[0:36:18] <Grayhammatter> oh crap, rhino prime? PogChamp

[0:36:23] <Matermind0> @shwepie and then you must find a way to increase your dick
[0:36:23] <+AXL808> So he's doing Natah and 2nd Dream this stream?
[0:36:27] <El_Samio> well, Pat is LITERALLY the biggest Tenno, since he's wearing the galatine rhino skin
[0:36:31] <%ssaryn> Eyyyyyy Teshin, sup.
[0:36:33] <TheKingBroseidon> uncle teshin
[0:36:33] <+Dasbubba> Anyone know if there is anything you can place in the earth template of your living quarters? Considering that or the aquarium.
[0:36:33] <Maverick2736> getting stuck is the biggest, most terrifying fear of all Tenno

[0:37:22] <cizal11> sounds like you didn't explore the relay very well thenefftw
[0:37:22] <+Nephthyz> @thenefftw That's because nobody plays Conclave.
[0:37:22] <tangoragahn> No one plays pvp

[0:37:23] <RahuStalker> He's the pvp guys pat
[0:37:24] <+Dasbubba> Testing has one of the best designs in this game.

[0:37:35] <elementofloyalty> Pat you are not know for thinking
[0:37:37] <+bustawof> Tenshin is more of an uncle then a dad
[0:37:38] <%Entonite> is this PS4 or PC
[0:37:38] <DXLelouch24> fuck the donations they can wait
[0:37:39] <@thenefftw> @cizal11 No, it's because I said fuck Conclave
[0:37:40] <+migofrompluto> These are the MAIN story quests
[0:37:41] <zakti_prime> space uncle who wants you to learn to fight and play ball
[0:37:41] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat this is about a two hour quest.
[0:37:42] <+preppyposs> yeah
[0:37:45] <+Kirbachev> @ssaryn I think part of it comes from streaming. When I briefly streamed, the odds of me getting weird bugged out shit fucking skyrocketed. Once got two Gluskins to spawn in the Outlast Whistleblower DLC.
[0:37:46] <tangoragahn> He played pvp a little
[0:37:51] <startadevy> have cape
[0:37:54] <startadevy> life goal
[0:37:56] <startadevy> confirmed
[0:37:56] <drakthebest> Protip: Unstuck command does not work
[0:37:56] <randomp141> Well that was odd, it says I was banned, then I refresh and I can watch... what'd I do?
[0:37:58] <elementofloyalty> Megatron?
[0:38:01] <Gorgen> reapers...
[0:38:02] <DXLelouch24> golem its War Within thats 2 hrs
[0:38:07] <NemokillerV> @angriestpat the command is !unstuck
[0:38:09] <+preppyposs> ah
[0:38:12] <+preppyposs> yeh
[0:38:13] <%ssaryn> @Kirbachev Streamer's/Commentator's Curse huh?
[0:38:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Reapers 2.0
[0:38:17] <%commanderclaw> so he does know
[0:38:18] <+skibbz_> pretty much yeah
[0:38:18] <startadevy> yeah
[0:38:21] <TheKingBroseidon> who told him
[0:38:22] <$magikestral> sentients are...yeah reapers are pretty close
[0:38:24] <%LunarSilence> wat
[0:38:25] <+preppyposs> wha
[0:38:25] <AdmiralPrawn> Ah yes, "Sentients". We have dismissed this claim.
[0:38:26] <Grayhammatter> the reapers! are real
[0:38:29] <%YabbaTroll> wait what
[0:38:29] <cizal11> he's been to the plains how would he not know
[0:38:30] <%spacekataz18> The ruperts
[0:38:32] <tangoragahn> Senpeints
[0:38:33] <Zombrocom> Nobody had to tell him they are in the lore/codex
[0:38:33] <+migofrompluto> The reapers are closer to the Infested >.>
[0:38:33] <KTDelgado> technically the orokins are the reapers
[0:38:35] <AtlasMcCoy> brutals
[0:38:37] <elementofloyalty> CHEAT
[0:38:47] <+JavaManJoJo> Man I forget that you can just iron skin through those
[0:38:48] <+Kirbachev> @ssaryn Definitely a part of it, I think. Odd glitches and handicapped ability seem to go hand-in-hand with streaming.
[0:38:48] <%YabbaTroll> pats met the stalker right?
[0:38:52] <TheKingBroseidon> scan it manually
[0:38:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Blast on the sonicor = up

[0:38:58] <zfenty> when did pat get a Helios?
[0:38:58] <elementofloyalty> she too cate the deetch?

[0:39:28] <Flunkorg> Oh, the sonicor will always suck, but the ragdoll gets funnier as it gets "stronger".
[0:39:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[0:39:30] <aeonicvector> he said he has, but never solo'd him
[0:39:31] <%voisraikien> He confirmed that Stalker pushed his shit in every time.

[0:42:12] <+Confused_4K> Always be iron skinning
[0:42:13] <%Dingus_Tickler> Rhino without Iron Skin is basically my limp penis
[0:42:13] <MC_GigglePants> This is Destiny: Part Deux
[0:42:15] <+MikoNoPants> I wonder if he's modded for iron skin or not
[0:42:18] <+AXL808> Rhino without armor is like being naked
[0:42:21] <+DZiffer> I caught your stream for the first time, I'm so happy! :D
[0:42:22] <MMetas> "Protect the console!" "Thanks man would have never figured that out"
[0:42:27] <%MisterCrimson> you say it's a shotgun but does it fire slugs? or is the grouping that tight?
[0:42:28] <cizal11> the head pat

[0:42:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> grineer = can teleport. cannot fuck
[0:42:42] <KTDelgado> wow thats actually fucked, he has to fight noxes
[0:42:45] <Flunkorg> @Dasbubba You can modify its range with mods btw
[0:42:52] <tangoragahn> Grineer steal tech pretty liberally
[0:42:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> u gonna die
[0:42:55] <bwong1231> they take extremely reduced damage on a Nox's body
[0:42:55] <cizal11> noxes at this level are absurdly easy
[0:42:58] <cizal11> if he just aims
[0:42:59] <MMetas> The things we give up for teleportation
[0:42:59] <+Nephthyz> @PlagueOfGripes Are you saying that you wanna see the grineer fuck then?
[0:43:00] <+MikoNoPants> Grineer are literally clones
[0:43:01] <@WoolyFish> So is this like space Harry Potter or what?
[0:43:02] <El_Samio> how the F did he get 1k spores?
[0:43:06] <KTDelgado> those guy would actually destroy pat holy fuck
[0:43:07] <MMetas> gene stability and ability to fuck
[0:43:07] <elementofloyalty> shoulda woulda coulda
[0:43:07] <Gorgen> Nox's are powerless without their heads!
[0:43:09] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @WoolyFish yes
[0:43:10] <+Kirbachev> I'd honestly be happier with drone companions if they were unarmed and ignored damage, and were just utility things. The weapons are damned-near useless as-is.
[0:43:16] <El_Samio> does he have like 4x resource boosters?
[0:43:17] <Goldteddy> Well when they teleported, all the important gooey parts stayed behind
[0:43:21] <zakti_prime> he needs to make pizzas for health and energy
[0:43:21] <elementofloyalty> BOING
[0:43:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It is exactly apce harry potter
[0:43:25] <+Dasbubba> @flunkorg I’m aware and have maxed out rhino previous. It’s still funny how giant is. Been running mag a lot lately and her ult is noticeably smaller.

[0:43:39] <%Malikial> The Slapstick Gun
[0:43:42] <Derkinstacker> Zenurik changed my life.
[0:43:51] <denam_of_windscale> more space ninja wizard crack huh?
[0:43:51] <Maverick2736> the tech the grineer have are cheap hand-me-downs from the Orokin, after all, and the Orokin where ABSURDLY advanced
[0:43:52] <Flunkorg> @Dasbubba You should see Limbo's max AoE size. Its absurd.
[0:43:53] <elementofloyalty> undress
[0:43:55] <%ssaryn> Just use the GUN

[0:44:06] <El_Samio> Pat talking shit abour Grineer, he gonna get Bombard'd
[0:44:08] <KTDelgado> the grineer will never be the strong boy and girl like the human
[0:44:08] <MC_GigglePants> Pat needs some punch through on that Hek
[0:44:08] <Zombrocom> Praise Zenurik
[0:44:09] <@PlagueOfGripes> wow, 472 damage. breaking all limits.

[0:44:11] <startadevy> sorry i had to
[0:44:12] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yea
[0:44:17] <MMetas> Sharpen your shotty Tenno
[0:44:22] <Worldbrand> I can't wait for him to get his ass blown out by sentient damage resistance
[0:44:25] <+AXL808> To be fair the Grineer were never really made for their brains
[0:44:29] <elementofloyalty> gravity
[0:44:31] <cizal11> it's gonna be fantastic
[0:44:33] <+Dasbubba> @flunkorg I still gotta make limbo. I have his quest but haven’t done it yet. But I’ve seen those bible he put up before with random. It is also massive.
[0:44:37] <DXLelouch24> how did Pat get more shots on his hek, i need to know the mod for that asap
[0:44:40] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat don't buy that mod the end reward is the same gun with the mod vaykor hek

[0:44:46] <TangledVirus> Thanks space uncle. I love you.

[0:44:49] <+Dasbubba> Bubble
[0:44:49] <Grayhammatter> i like this space uncle guy
[0:44:52] <+DZiffer> Don't be mean to Grineer soldiers, just think about how you would feel if they send you into battle with inflatable cover.
[0:44:53] <Zombrocom> Nah, the grineer were very much made for their brains, or rather, lacktherof
[0:44:56] <elementofloyalty> SPORES
[0:44:57] <glacialbluebird> Domed

[0:45:16] <%ssaryn> apatBig Sex Space Mom
[0:45:18] <+Kirbachev> I absolutely love how the Hek has resisted any and all powercreep since Alpha. It's still a solid weapon, even at end-game. That said, you really should be using the Vaykor version at that point.
[0:45:18] <laguerrilha> @AngriestPat Strongest Tenno? But what about all those cooler and stronger Tenno walking around in Cetus?
[0:45:19] <TangledVirus> Lotus is spacemom.

[0:51:09] <+ccwettr123> lol 'what is a tenno' you'll find out Pat. You'll find out ;)
[0:51:10] <laguerrilha> dont see the point of cloning since it wont be the same person. they originals are still dead
[0:51:12] <rhetoricalAcrobat> "What is a tenno other than a space ninja" GEE I WONDER IF WE'LL GET AN ANSWER
[0:51:15] <anon_1307> 10-O
[0:51:16] <+Sonik2324> i always liked doing the super hero landing in this game
[0:51:16] <Worldbrand> What a stream to start asking that
[0:51:17] <MMetas> beefy space ninja
[0:51:18] <elementofloyalty> RUSH THRU THE GAME
[0:51:21] <Grayhammatter> a tenno is a GENETIC FREAK!
[0:51:22] <+Nephthyz> @captainthunderwolf I thought it was biomechanical.
[0:51:22] <+valkuma> is it even possible to lose or get hurt in this game, you just seem like a god
[0:51:24] <FirewallStorm> in the next quest you'll find out some thing
[0:51:25] <Flunkorg> Remind me, does it ever outright SAY what a tenno is/made from or did you always have to piece it together yourself?
[0:51:29] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @MikoNoPants Unless you have mods for it and are built around it may as well be a waste of energy
[0:51:32] <+preppyposs> yeh
[0:51:32] <Lysdexic9541> Rhino's passive is really cool
[0:51:32] <%Imperial_Madman> Would you fuck a grineer
[0:51:33] <@thenefftw> What is a Tenno? THEY'RE A GENETIC FREAK
[0:51:33] <+crimsonharvest> Chat how do I get more Sentinels? I need more pets.
[0:51:34] <Sunstalker> I love Rhino but that goddamn fartnosie everytime he does his orbital drop shit
[0:51:35] <elementofloyalty> Dat ass
[0:51:35] <DXLelouch24> guys will he make himself or Paige?
[0:51:37] <%LunarSilence> You're weird
[0:51:38] <TheKingBroseidon> gotta grind for plot
[0:51:38] <%YabbaTroll> @laguerrilha you can sure use em as slaves tho
[0:51:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> @laguerrilha they're a cloned slave race, it deosnt matter if theyre the same person
[0:51:40] <+Phobaws06> MADA MADA
[0:51:40] <%MisterCrimson> I always assumed Tenno were downloaded consciousnesses made of nano machines
[0:51:44] <El_Samio> @valkuma yeah, you can get wrecked, esp. in later missions
[0:51:44] <Shwepie> Grineer already cured their cloning disease, but then Lotus told you to steal it and destroy all research.
[0:51:44] <drakthebest> 100 hours to unlock the character creator
[0:51:47] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Yare yare...

[0:51:48] <+TeethMuncher> You didn't need plot before
[0:51:52] <%captainthunderwolf> @ZeggaZegga Sci-Fi, man. Lots of official terms for the exact same thing.

[0:51:58] <+migofrompluto> They didn't introduce the plot until like a year after it was released >.>
[0:51:58] <+Vostroyan1> oh ye expose
[0:51:59] <Cobalt_Racer> there's actually plot before this, it's just you don't need to really do it before this
[0:51:59] <Innocuous_Goat> Keep in mind this game has been constantly updated
[0:52:01] <+Dasbubba> @valkuma at higher level stuff it really easy to be unable to kill a single enemy and get shredded if your gear isn’t up to par.

[0:52:14] <Lazaruz95> @Flunkorg If I remember correctly, it VERY explicitly says just exactly what a Tenno is at the end of The Second Dream
[0:52:16] <DXLelouch24> we can go nuts
[0:52:18] <Kratok> This kind of just reminds me that I hated the open world progression

[0:53:16] <DantesAnimus> ew
[0:53:16] <Shwepie> @Delta56th Back in your day you still had plot. It was just buried deeper and was more obtuse than Dark Souls lore.

[0:54:15] <+migofrompluto> To think there is an even better version of the Hek :P
[0:54:19] <Badendchan> Pat is the type that absolutely would have grinded 100 missions to get the Brakk back in Gradivus like I did ;-;
[0:54:20] <+grandCurator> someone get Pat the Redeemer and a stance for it. that thing is still super good even after needs and it's a pocket shotty
[0:54:22] <startadevy> alone?
[0:54:23] <+Punchasaur> i guess with names like that they'd have to be
[0:54:24] <+MikoNoPants> @LORDSPOOKLEKINS That and making sure you have mods to either reduce energy use in channeling or generate energy in general like Energy siphon to help
[0:54:26] <elementofloyalty> 89%
[0:54:32] <+migofrompluto> How do you improve upon perfection :P

[0:55:21] <Cobaltor_252> LOOK AT HARROW GRAXX
[0:55:22] <Mattthememe> Early graxx skins? Understandable. Later skins for Atlas and Mesa? Absolutely not.
[0:55:22] <KTDelgado> SOMEONE CLIP THAT
[0:55:24] <Cyphereous> Oh no.
[0:55:25] <+Phobaws06> FIRED, SHOTS HAVE BEEN

[0:55:30] <glacialbluebird> HEAVY DAY
[0:55:33] <anon_1307> how edgy
[0:55:33] <smellmycowbro> LOCAL DWARF CANADIAN FOUND SLAUGHTERED IN AN ALLEYWAY
[0:55:35] <startadevy> youtube?
[0:55:35] <Goldteddy> if you mod Redeemer correctly its shotgun blast can delete shit in front of you better than a main weapon can
[0:55:38] <applesonthemoon> thats it im unsubbing from superbunnyhop
[0:55:39] <+MikoNoPants> Rhino, Excal, Frost and Volt Graxx look like trash
[0:55:39] <%Malikial> Pat's too good for Crayons now.
[0:55:39] <tangoragahn> Rhino Graxx? Crazy talk!
[0:55:41] <%Wurd> Atlas Graxx looks really cool
[0:55:42] <Delta56th> Rhino Graxx is pretty lame.
[0:55:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> ZA WARUDO
[0:55:45] <$PonyHearts> You can never be cool Pat.
[0:55:47] <MMetas> To be fair the graxx stuff looks like something matt would like
[0:55:50] <+grandCurator> @goldteddy that's what I did. It's handy
[0:55:51] <+Dasbubba> So is the main way to get even higher damage needing Baro’qiteer mods? I hit the final upgrades of damage mods for stuff like serration and can’t seem to tune up my weapon damage
[0:55:55] <+DZiffer> My Saryn Graxx's butt begs to differ
[0:55:55] <+spiraljoel> Atlas Graxx is maybe the best skin in the game since it's a complete remodel
[0:55:56] <+Sonik2324> zephry graxx only good 1
[0:55:56] <elementofloyalty> Pat starts with 52 crayons and is down to 26
[0:55:57] <+Confused_4K> I feel attacked
[0:55:58] <MMetas> especiallu grax vauban
[0:55:59] <+migofrompluto> Atlas Graxx is pure sex!
[0:56:00] <%ssaryn> Honestly, the only good Graxx skins are Harrow and Nova.
[0:56:01] <El_Samio> Atlas Graxx is basically Matt's Atlas
[0:56:04] <%ssaryn> And Atlas actually
[0:56:08] <Maverick2736> to be fair, some of the Graxx skins look far better than the rest
[0:56:09] <Derkinstacker> Stop it stop it, he's already dead...
[0:56:16] <tangoragahn> Primed mods and elemental damage mods

[0:58:20] <Cyphereous> Corpus were more like the low level merchants who were under the Orokin. So they looked up to their power and wealth, then that eventually turned to worship when the Orokin died.

[1:06:45] <NMEDom> YOU HAVE NOT A CHOICE!
[1:06:52] <VritraReiRei> PLEASE BE "UNDERWATER DEFENSE" BlessRNG
[1:06:54] <Cobalt_Racer> salad's not for a while, or this quest
[1:06:55] <tangoragahn> There's neat hints to Lotus lore in it, not a lot tho
[1:06:56] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Oh my god that hack was fucking OCD
[1:06:58] <%Dread_First> I mean theres space defence so.
[1:07:00] <MMetas> Rip
[1:07:01] <MMetas> here we go
[1:07:02] <+MrZell183> Rhino is such an absolute unit.
[1:07:03] <AtlasMcCoy> F
[1:07:05] <elementofloyalty> DINNER TIME
[1:07:05] <+Darsis> He finish the spoiler missions yet?
[1:07:06] <Grayhammatter> aw
[1:07:07] <Grayhammatter> F
[1:07:10] <El_Samio> look at his face once he realizes it's a MOBILE defence pretending to be defence
[1:07:14] <startadevy> rip
[1:07:15] <elementofloyalty> bitch
[1:07:17] <AtlasMcCoy> "Warframe cryopod" Lel devs
[1:07:19] <MMetas> He's gonna be so confused when he has to move
[1:07:20] <Gorgen> worst defence mission
[1:07:21] <+migofrompluto> He's at the tail end of Natah, so no
[1:07:22] <tangoragahn> Confidence
[1:07:25] <+Dasbubba> That one arch wing pursuit quest that’s not a story mission where you have to drop a ship in a time limit is probably one of the worst missions in this game.
[1:07:29] <+MikoNoPants> This defense mission is fine
[1:07:30] <+Confused_4K> Ugh hate this tile set
[1:07:39] <startadevy> snnaaaaaaaaakee
[1:07:40] <risenlp2> Aw [Hek]
[1:07:41] <laguerrilha> Did Pat buy Helios with plat?
[1:07:42] <+MikoNoPants> They are making a new defense mission for this tile set
[1:07:43] <MMetas> It's objectively the most annoying defense
[1:07:44] <%MisterCrimson> Frost is great for non Infested defense
[1:07:44] <LocoCrazy_> Excuse me.
[1:07:48] <Jaxterpeace> 10 waves. . . nap time
[1:07:49] <Goldteddy> game doesn't pause unless you put it on solo
[1:07:50] <Lenmutt> is pat at the mastery for Tigris yet?
[1:07:54] <Zombrocom> Defend that cryopod... bomb... The Target.
[1:08:02] <El_Samio> nope, he's like 5 MR levels away from tigris primo
[1:08:09] <AtlasMcCoy> @Goldteddy Also can't pause even on solo in plains
[1:08:10] <MMetas> I want his live reaction when he does the moving target defense sortie
[1:08:11] <elementofloyalty> get off my wave
[1:08:11] <MMetas> lol
[1:08:13] <+rustyrockfish> What did he buy with his drug money?
[1:08:13] <+MikoNoPants> Tigris is MR10 or 11 now isn't it?
[1:08:16] <+Darsis> Pat and Plague got me back into this game... Damn them
[1:08:17] <Cobalt_Racer> gO
[1:08:17] <zcairstrike> How long til he realizes that it moved?
[1:08:18] <GodVodka> he hasn't realized yet LuL
[1:08:18] <@thenefftw> GO TO IT
[1:08:19] <tangoragahn> AW Pursuit's easy with a fluctus, it's basically Exalted Blade: The Gun
[1:08:20] <grayjammer> @Lenmutt Hes at mastery for regular Tigris
[1:08:21] <Zombrocom> Frost is great for infested defense too, since it slows anything in the bubble
[1:08:23] <Lenmutt> i meant regular pretty sure they recent;y change normal tigris mr
[1:08:24] <%InkblotBlues> Go
[1:08:24] <Asiveni> Hijack BabyRage
[1:08:24] <Worldbrand> Base Tigris is only 7, he should be fine
[1:08:24] <+MarshallLee67> it will
[1:08:25] <elementofloyalty> ee yup
[1:08:25] <MMetas> MOVE
[1:08:25] <$SGrim> It's basically a slinger. SeemsGood
[1:08:25] <Delta56th> Maybe.
[1:08:26] <BaronVonWolfe> PAT GO
[1:08:27] <KTDelgado> SHH
[1:08:27] <zakti_prime> it moveddddxxd
[1:08:27] <MMetas> PAT MOVE
[1:08:28] <El_Samio> "oh shit"
[1:08:30] <+Confused_4K> It’s very dead space
[1:08:32] <+dtogo> what fist weapon is that?
[1:08:32] <+migofrompluto> Do you think Pat would enjoy the Statacor?
[1:08:35] <$Vanessa_Ui> @AngriestPat Your Rhino looks regal as fuck.
[1:08:36] <Lenmutt> ah thanks
[1:08:39] <+MikoNoPants> I know the Tigris used to be MR4
[1:08:43] <+Dasbubba> @lenmutt on Twitter he said he’s almost to 8 and you need 13 for Tigris prime.
[1:08:44] <+MikoNoPants> but went up in the weapon rework
[1:08:47] <El_Samio> Staticor is animu as fuck, ofc Pat would love it
[1:08:48] <Zombrocom> Everyone enjoy hadoken guns
[1:08:48] <GimmieGarbage> For a brief instant, I thought your character looked like Skull Knight, and I loved you.
[1:08:58] <risenlp2> Who knew a giant black-head gun would be so powerful.
[1:08:59] <+MikoNoPants> I got a Tigris Prime recently and dumped 3 forma in it
[1:09:04] <+Dasbubba> But yeah he could get base Tigris at this point. I was running it at this level too.
[1:09:04] <deviljhojho94> they HATE being shot
[1:09:06] <+MikoNoPants> I need only 1 more forma in it to get it where I want
[1:09:13] <elementofloyalty> MY LEG
[1:09:20] <+ccwettr123> so, do we think he'll actually finish both natah and second dream tonight?
[1:09:23] <+rustyrockfish> he needs to get the aug for it
[1:09:29] <MMetas> I would also hate getting shot with a shot gun
[1:09:32] <CharileMurphyPendelton> Pat's favorite weapon the shotgun
[1:09:33] <$Ralfclogs> I love the cloak
[1:09:36] <tangoragahn> Thats the plan
[1:09:37] <blackwolf4567> @ccwettr123 i hope so
[1:09:39] <elementofloyalty> GREAT PUNK BAND
[1:09:41] <+grandCurator> Scattered Justice is dumb strong
[1:09:44] <+Bricespresso> the hek is the bane of life in general
[1:09:46] <+unfoldingchoas> he can get that awesome hek mod
[1:09:46] <Ethatre> vaykor*
[1:09:46] <xalrv> Tigris prime master race B)
[1:09:48] <zcairstrike> Why use Vaykor Hek when you can use Hek with the augment mod?
[1:09:52] <Zombrocom> So wait how does teshin know what a lion is
[1:09:54] <+migofrompluto> Dex Sybaris is a good early game lever action burst rifle. Though yeah it falls off late game
[1:09:55] <+rustyrockfish> that mod will carry him tot he end game too
[1:09:57] <AtlasMcCoy> I love my mutalist cernos even though no one cares about it
[1:09:57] <Misericordia92> what the hek
[1:09:59] <TheOnlyStrayCat> Pat, are you implying there's something that WOULD enjoy being shot with shotgun rounds?
[1:10:01] <risenlp2> oh [hek] it's ...that guy with the nice butt

[1:10:14] <+MikoNoPants> When moddied right

[1:10:16] <CharileMurphyPendelton> so rumor has it Warframe devs wants this game on the Switch
[1:10:16] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> is that the same voice actor who is the mission briefer in Ace Combat Infinite?
[1:10:16] <El_Samio> Vaykor Hek outperforms Scattered Justice Hek when given prime ravage and some other prime mods
[1:10:17] <TheNeedlesD> Spew toxic ass?
[1:10:20] <tangoragahn> Not underwater
[1:10:20] <AnacondaVirtue> Absolute units

[1:11:34] <Worldbrand> So you call "Cryopods" "Bombs" despite the fact that they are obviously Warframes.
[1:11:35] <puddingpants88> the bombs are the Warframe EXTRA THICC booty
[1:11:36] <zcairstrike> @MikoNoPants Really? Fair. I haven't used either in bloody ages, I just remember that augment being stupid.
[1:11:40] <@thenefftw> This isn't Time Stop, Pat
[1:11:40] <elementofloyalty> time COP
[1:11:40] <OfficialTimothy> TPFufun They're Bombs? Warframes? Who knows. Maybe both.
[1:11:41] <%ThePeacefulDream> That looks neat.
[1:11:42] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> but what if warframes are built like Gundams and have superbombs built into them?
[1:11:43] <Rada150> WRONG LIMBO CAN ZA WARUDO
[1:11:44] <prismaticsnake> za floordo
[1:11:45] <Maverick2736> ah yeah... willing suspension of disbelief is necessary for this mission
[1:11:46] <NemokillerV> @AngriestPat you can't stop timepat
[1:11:47] <laguerrilha> Those Warframes are DAH BOMB
[1:11:47] <MMetas> No pat
[1:11:50] <ivansonic08> wait until you get limbo
[1:11:50] <shotgang86> ZA WARUDO
[1:11:51] <sjcodan> And you call them bombs despite the fact that they are clearly warframes
[1:11:54] <+DecoDillo> Has pat got limbo yet?
[1:11:56] <+grandCurator> why isn't there a frame based around Bomb's with a passive that removes or reduces self damage from explosions?
[1:11:57] <+migofrompluto> Yeah, you can litteraly chop people in half
[1:11:58] <+QuadraticGravity> @DecoDillo Nope.
[1:11:59] <+DJRaVeS> new frame confirmed bomb frame zimeLUL zimeLUL zimeLUL
[1:12:00] <MMetas> it's like reverse bullet time
[1:12:02] <sjcodan> Excuse me for one second
[1:12:02] <anon_1307> condition oveload?
[1:12:03] <+DecoDillo> Pat needs limbo and spira
[1:12:03] <+Bricespresso> those will bomb your life irl LUL
[1:12:05] <MMetas> only limbo can ever stop time
[1:12:07] <Kratok> Shsshshsh
[1:12:08] <sunny935> limbo stops time though
[1:12:10] <puddingpants88> whhhyyyyyyy
[1:12:15] <+MikoNoPants> The Tigris Prime grossly outperforms the Tigris, Sancti Tigris, Hek and Vaykor Hek in bust damage
[1:12:17] <elementofloyalty> Lotus talks to its self
[1:12:21] <Goldteddy> Wait why haven't they made a Time frame yet!? they made a freaking Music one!
[1:12:21] <+Confused_4K> Thankfully the don’t reuse as much in the other story missions
[1:12:21] <KTDelgado> wow wtf they changed his look
[1:12:21] <+dtogo> but what is that melee weapon?
[1:12:26] <Croetec> Limbo even has the JoJo animation set
[1:12:35] <HypeArbalest> Limbo voids out things
[1:12:37] <Rada150> Limbo can be colored to look like Zeppeli
[1:12:37] <MMetas> All of them can pat
[1:12:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> very cool
[1:12:38] <$SGrim> You do the Ora Ora and have Time Stop? STAR PLATINUM: ZA WARUDO! KKona
[1:12:38] <grayjammer> @dtogo Kogake
[1:12:39] <GodVodka> limbo is more jojo than rhino
[1:12:39] <%ThePeacefulDream> Za Warudo?
[1:12:40] <GodVodka> dw
[1:12:43] <+skibbz_> really makes you think
[1:12:46] <+QuadraticGravity> BUT PAT
[1:12:47] <@thenefftw> Pat, you need to get Limbo for the true World experience
[1:12:48] <+dtogo> thanks
[1:12:48] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> YEAH BUT LIMBO IS LITERALY DIO CAN JUST BE MADE TO LOOK LIKE HIM
[1:12:48] <+QuadraticGravity> LIMBO
[1:12:51] <Zombrocom> Limbo can literally Dio though
[1:12:52] <+DZiffer> Limbo is literally a Stand
[1:12:53] <TyrantBelial> Pat all frames can be coloured to be theworld
[1:12:55] <Lenmutt> ragdoll tho
[1:12:55] <glacialbluebird> Toki wa tomare
[1:12:58] <%captainthunderwolf> I can't believe this game with customizable paint jobs allows you to paint your Warframe gold.
[1:12:58] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> and then he punches for the MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
[1:12:58] <JT137> Stomp the Yard
[1:12:59] <+rustyrockfish> does he have any potatotes yet
[1:12:59] <CertainlySyrix> pat still doesn't know
[1:13:00] <+Confused_4K> Give him limbos stance
[1:13:01] <+migofrompluto> Because time manipulation is silly :P
[1:13:04] <shotgang86> PAT, make rhyno ZAWARUO
[1:13:04] <risenlp2> Ah yes, Sonicor space program
[1:13:06] <%captainthunderwolf> What an obvioous Easter egg.
[1:13:09] <elementofloyalty> @AngriestPat You play INSIDE after this?
[1:13:11] <xalrv> Limbo is literally Dio
[1:13:11] <puddingpants88> muda muda muda muda
[1:13:14] <+DZiffer> he does JoJo poses and is untouchable by anyone who isn't like him
[1:13:14] <+KingVantq> Has Pat even seen a limbo user yet?
[1:13:15] <sjcodan> Rhino is so strong his STOMP damages spacetime
[1:13:16] <thelonechris> Hello, Pat!
[1:13:17] <+AntithesisEK> It took a rework to make Limbo function like that it was hardly the original intent.
[1:13:19] <knomad2b> so are prime frames just better than the normal set?
[1:13:19] <MMetas> lol
[1:13:19] <+JavaManJoJo> Is this the next requiem of Pat's Stand? Not looking at chat so he doesn't know how wrong he is?
[1:13:23] <CertainlySyrix> @captainthunderwolf you can get far, far closer to za warudo than rhino
[1:13:24] <%YabbaTroll> OOF
[1:13:24] <MMetas> he doesn't know he doesn't have a choice
[1:13:24] <AtlasMcCoy> Isnt Natah required for second dream?
[1:13:25] <Maverick2736> Limbos are hyper-defensive griefers, though, so Rhino is the cooler JoJo reference
[1:13:26] <@PlagueOfGripes> whaaaa
[1:13:26] <+grandCurator> atpQuan
[1:13:27] <+Castle_Kundarak> Humans? HAH.
[1:13:27] <+Darsis> I just started building my Ivara... so many spy missions
[1:13:28] <GodVodka> 🤔 you may be onto something
[1:13:29] <+preppyposs> pat stop dogfighting
[1:13:29] <VectMachine> I think you HAVE to do Natah before doing Second Dream.
[1:13:30] <+migofrompluto> You can't do The Second Dream before Natah can you?
[1:13:30] <%ssaryn> @thenefftw Actually been playing around with Limbo a bit and, not gonna lie, I'll be in there as soon as I got my build going for it.
[1:13:30] <+MikoNoPants> Second Dream requires Natah as is even though he isn't reading chat
[1:13:30] <sjcodan> UH
[1:13:30] <KTDelgado> he needs the the kunai for WRRRRRRRRRRRRYYYYYYY
[1:13:30] <Zombrocom> Well, of course you HAVE TO do natah before second dream
[1:13:31] <Gorgen> take that back!
[1:13:31] <UvBenServed> What? Noooooooo
[1:13:31] <+AntithesisEK> Natah is a prerequisite anyway
[1:13:35] <urs0jb> you need natah for SD
[1:13:35] <lord_souls> but limbo can stop time throw shit that stops in air then unstop time
[1:13:35] <risenlp2> LOTUS is 3 Kavats in a suit
[1:13:37] <@thenefftw> Lotus is Space Mom, that's all you need to know
[1:13:38] <@PlagueOfGripes> pfffft... cough.... come on, I... haaaaa.
[1:13:38] <TheOnlyStrayCat> What? No way. Who could have guessed.
[1:13:42] <El_Samio> Kunai? Despair is better
[1:13:42] <startadevy> i don't see this on
[1:13:43] <anon_1307> there are no humans in warframe
[1:13:45] <Banjoboozle> @AngriestPat Pat, lend Liam your energy so he can beat the hardest boss in Kingdom Hearts 2
[1:13:45] <tUxUt> dont take away his fake joy
[1:13:47] <El_Samio> for Limbo Cosplay
[1:13:48] <%InkblotBlues> Be nice to Space Mom. She cuts the crust off of your sandwiches just the way you like them.
[1:13:49] <ThatRandomGuy661> Guys I think he meant for the stream
[1:13:49] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> @risenlp2 LUL
[1:13:51] <+MetroidHunter26> Can't even play Second Dream without playing Natah quest first tho
[1:13:51] <T_Sasquatch> I never even assumed anyone would be a human LUL
[1:13:59] <laguerrilha> Thicc as that, it doesnt matter
[1:14:01] <Goldteddy> wait does his Helios not suck up loot for him!?
[1:14:02] <+MikoNoPants> anon. you'd be shocked how many humans are still around in Warframe
[1:14:03] <elementofloyalty> AH
[1:14:04] <%SaltyDongs> How are the hats pat
[1:14:04] <%captainthunderwolf> @CertainlySyrix Well yeah, I think you in fact told me about how Limbo was REWORKED to be Dio. That's why I'm being so sarcastic to Pat's reaching right now.
[1:14:05] <Misericordia92> the ostron is human right?
[1:14:08] <%Zombiemowlcher> Yo I got the Hek PRIME
[1:14:09] <Matermind0> I thought everyone was just a weird warped human
[1:14:10] <MMetas> I like plague getting frustrated by every turn
[1:14:12] <TheOnlyStrayCat> @Banjoboozle He's fighting Sephiroth now?
[1:14:15] <+MarshallLee67> bombs
[1:14:18] <GodVodka> stasis pods armed to go BOOM
[1:14:19] <+migofrompluto> He might not have a Vacuum mod in his Helios yet
[1:14:19] <risenlp2> Stasis bombs
[1:14:20] <$PonyHearts> The Lotus just pretends to be human to steal your fluids.
[1:14:20] <MMetas> Bomframes
[1:14:22] <NMEDom> Huntig pickles, be back shortly
[1:14:22] <AtlasMcCoy> Stop looking behind the curtain
[1:14:23] <+skibbz_> it's FIIIINE
[1:14:23] <elementofloyalty> Bob Ombs
[1:14:24] <+MikoNoPants> Orokin to some extent were human, osterons and corpus have humans
[1:14:24] <MMetas> STOP LOOKING AT IT
[1:14:24] <Lysdexic9541> It's fiiiiiiine
[1:14:25] <%InkblotBlues> Stasis goes big boom
[1:14:27] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @T_Sasquatch I mean it's pretty early on literally every enemy you fight was once human
[1:14:28] <glacialbluebird> Shhh
[1:14:28] <MMetas> SHOOT THE GRINEER
[1:14:29] <%captainthunderwolf> For fuck's sake, they're called CRYOPODS.
[1:14:29] <El_Samio> well, one of the big points of warframe is to make you ask "wtf even is a human"
[1:14:29] <+AntithesisEK> Crashing these stasis pods
[1:14:31] <+WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> LUL
[1:14:32] <%captainthunderwolf> IT'S IN THE NAME
[1:14:35] <Kerozero> Boy do you know how many warframes abilities are to just blow up?
[1:14:37] <+Confused_4K> STASIS BOMBS
[1:14:37] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> It says*
[1:14:38] <AtlasMcCoy> Less think more shoot
[1:14:38] <+TardyClock> With no survivors
[1:14:40] <Banjoboozle> @TheOnlyStrayCat Lingering Will. He beat Sephiroth
[1:14:42] <+MikoNoPants> Grineer are human based
[1:14:43] <malletman241> cryostasis
[1:14:48] <+VariantX7> They even have a bomb model...why didn't they just use the cascade bomb prop from one of the earliest quests?
[1:14:48] <MMetas> CRYO POD BOMBS
[1:14:51] <TheOnlyStrayCat> Ah.
[1:14:52] <%captainthunderwolf> Oh man, Lingering Will.
[1:14:53] <risenlp2> I need a mod that gives a spray of confetti and a 'whee!' when you one shot things
[1:14:53] <MMetas> THEY FREEZE THE WATER
[1:14:54] <MC_GigglePants> Those aren't stasis pods, they're battery packs! Like in the Matrix or something.
[1:14:54] <+quarkee> i thought lotus was a cephalon like suda and ordis
[1:14:56] <Mattthememe> I suppose if you wanted to look at it a certain way Lotus could rig the void conduits from warframes to make a massive void explosion. Specifically for sentients.
[1:14:57] <Goldteddy> .....if thats the case, then he still hasn't experienced the sweet life
[1:14:58] <%Darsis> Well, warframes can do all kinds of magic shit, so why not a few of them used to make a huge boom for a bomb
[1:15:03] <puddingpants88> they have to self destruct. the world isn't ready for the level of THICC these Warframe ASS possess
[1:15:04] <Maverick2736> @anon_1307 but there are, though. Like, in Cetus and the relays and everywhere. The Orokin where also human
[1:15:05] <%SaltyDongs> maybe if you make your character look more like optimus prime Paige won't yell at you
[1:15:06] <El_Samio> how many genetic modifications and cybernetics can you shove into someone until they stop being human?
[1:15:08] <zcairstrike> Pat, you don't have to ADS with the shotgun every time.
[1:15:08] <%captainthunderwolf> I've never seen someone combo'd to death that fast without hitting the ground once.
[1:15:13] <Cobalt_Racer> press f to pay respects for sonicor space program
[1:15:16] <%captainthunderwolf> Lingering Will gives me chest pains.
[1:15:17] <+skibbz_> rip blast sonicor FeelsBadMan
[1:15:18] <Lenmutt> man hekk, tigris, arca plasmor, corinth, stillia... pat is going to love how many fantastic shotguns there are

[1:15:23] <+Nthenorm> F FeelsBadMan
[1:15:30] <tangoragahn> Why does it say Warframe Cryopod under the bomb's health?
[1:15:31] <Matermind0> @mattthememe But we’re just sealing the tomb here, aren’t we?
[1:15:33] <%rustyrockfish> corinth best shotgun
[1:15:34] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Before I saw Tenno faction people with their faces, I originally thought all Tenno were robots and that Corpus was the closest thing to human in the solar system
[1:15:35] <MMetas> No pat

[1:16:04] <%Daigrey> I love this guy. He's such a jackass.
[1:16:05] <Maverick2736> I love how much of a fucking troll Tyl Regor is
[1:16:08] <+MikoNoPants> You can make the hek gross with Scattered justice, hells chamber and vigilantee armaments
[1:16:09] <tangoragahn> L O R E
[1:16:12] <wowsandman> Don’t question him

[1:16:39] <@kizaru232> custom objectives are hard, it's fine like this
[1:16:39] <NoxinPistol> Warframes make good bombs. Especially Nova.
[1:16:41] <deanbees> bombs exposed on stream

[1:19:35] <MC_GigglePants> Amazon Vay Hek is the greatest warframe video ever made
[1:19:35] <AtlasMcCoy> Naw everyone's an asshole in this universe
[1:19:35] <risenlp2> They are brainwashed clones.
[1:19:35] <Flightedwings> no
[1:19:37] <deanbees> FUCK EM
[1:19:37] <+Ciphris> the grineer are dickbags
[1:19:37] <%captainthunderwolf> No
[1:19:38] <elementofloyalty> nope
[1:19:40] <tangoragahn> "They're Sentient," the moment Sentients got their name and their race was recognized
[1:19:41] <Icyterr0r> just glue my head to a drone
[1:19:41] <+quarkee> was about to ask if you had seen the hek alexa
[1:19:41] <%rustyrockfish> clones my boi

[1:19:45] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> no, they are bred to die
[1:19:46] <cizal11> but mostly no
[1:19:47] <Matermind0> No
[1:19:47] <+migofrompluto> *Vay Hek attaches to his turkeyframe* PENIS MOBILE AWAY!!
[1:19:50] <+MajorCrasher> except clem
[1:19:53] <MMetas> Oh boy
[1:19:54] <Rada150> they are alot of different people just constantley being cloned
[1:19:54] <Matermind0> Except for Clem
[1:19:55] <sub_par0> They literally cloned so much they fucked it up
[1:19:55] <$monkeyhous3> hell no they're dicks
[1:19:56] <Gorgen> stop humanizing the slaves
[1:19:57] <sunny935> wonder if pat saw the look brothers one
[1:19:57] <alebeard> oh man, cant wait for the Kuva stuff
[1:19:58] <Goldteddy> Soloing Vay hek to farm Hydroid parts back in the day, was a pain in the royal ass due to his magnetic taser attack
[1:19:58] <Sulliman34> "man servitude sucks! LETS FOLLOW A QUEEN"
[1:19:59] <Delta56th> Who cares just kill da meaningless clone lives.
[1:20:00] <+zork990> clem is best grineer
[1:20:01] <%MisterCrimson> They're the Geth, except clones.
[1:20:01] <Flunkorg> Technically none of them are "perfect" clones, so they have there own... quirks
[1:20:01] <Maverick2736> guys, Pat isn't reading chat. They're rhetorical questions
[1:20:03] <%Zombiemowlcher> Don't worry, they'll recycle the fallen then get REAL crazy
[1:20:04] <HypeArbalest> He has proaganda lasers
[1:20:04] <%InkblotBlues> Yeah but they are also huge dick bags.
[1:20:04] <+Confused_4K> Only steel maridian is cool
[1:20:05] <$PonyHearts> That was the funniest Alexa edit to date!
[1:20:10] <Giothegame> Is Warframe doing a April Fools thing?
[1:20:11] <+Thepothero> @angriestpat NO SLAY THEM AND TAKE BACK SOL DEUS VULT
[1:20:11] <%TaifuDragon> @Sulliman34 they can't help that part
[1:20:12] <puddingpants88> so basically the plot of exosquad with the neosapians
[1:20:12] <+unfoldingchoas> CLEM
[1:20:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ((()))
[1:20:18] <NoxinPistol> Not entirely. Some were born with defects, just like the Steel Meridian which allowed them to defy their masters.
[1:20:20] <%TaifuDragon> @Sulliman34 They are GENETICALLY PROGRAMMED to follow the queens
[1:20:21] <%rustyrockfish> you should faction up with the friendly grineer faction
[1:20:22] <%Daigrey> CLEM!
[1:20:23] <MMetas> wow we at 1.1k viewers
[1:20:23] <AtlasMcCoy> If I was rich I wouldnt wanna stop being rich either
[1:20:24] <+Phobaws06> and nullifiers
[1:20:27] <Cobalt_Racer> god de has completely neglected the poor corpus
[1:20:27] <+AntithesisEK> they were merchants not orokin elite
[1:20:28] <Kerozero> And Corpus consider Money as a religion
[1:20:30] <sjcodan> TIME IS CREDITS, TENNO
[1:20:31] <+jorgamund> Pat can relate to people who become jerks after grappling with their own mortality Kappa
[1:20:31] <tangoragahn> Presumably it was supposed to be a temporary name as the Orokin purged the Sentients
[1:20:32] <%Fenrirlives> CLEM
[1:20:32] <Sulliman34> @TaifuDragon fair enough
[1:20:33] <Cobalt_Racer> pls more corpus lore de
[1:20:33] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Corpus = Weyland Yutani
[1:20:42] <Rngiddion> look the Corpus have those amazing Box helmets all of their blandness is excused for that
[1:20:44] <%Fenrirlives> Clem justifies the entire Grineer race
[1:20:44] <sub_par0> But money religion
[1:20:47] <EASrake> Riven is such a dope word
[1:20:47] <Gorgen> Hun plz
[1:20:48] <+Confused_4K> No it’s a bomb tho
[1:20:48] <AC9_Nineball> You will be randomized. I will not be able to stop them
[1:20:49] <Mattthememe> riven.....
[1:20:52] <tangoragahn> Didn't work out that way
[1:20:53] <%InkblotBlues> Man that Steel Meridian leader though. MMMmm

[1:21:44] <%ssaryn> CHECK YOUR LORE NERD
[1:21:45] <Gorgen> "hides"
[1:21:47] <UvBenServed> Is this Anor Londo?
[1:21:47] <%captainthunderwolf> I mean, is Riven coincidental in the context of the game? Even as a real word, that feels like a very intentional naming decision.
[1:21:47] <Sulliman34> you get your first riven from The War Within @AnimatronicNightmare
[1:21:48] <sjcodan> PAt
[1:21:49] <+AntithesisEK> yeah its a story reward @AnimatronicNightmare

[1:21:56] <hecadisth> idk rivens could be based on sentient tech we dont know how that cephalon makes em
[1:21:57] <Matermind0> Are they really spoilers then?
[1:21:58] <El_Samio> "guy in loading screen" LUL
[1:21:59] <tangoragahn> After The War Within Animatronic
[1:21:59] <applesonthemoon> man this place is ACTUALLY anor londo!
[1:21:59] <Kerozero> !crazytalk
[1:22:00] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> I can’t wait for Crazy Talk to activate during the second dream and trigger the fuck out of chat
[1:22:00] <Mattthememe> I guess thats why the cephalon i nthe riven screen is also in a bunch of pieces
[1:22:00] <CertainlySyrix> Pat's Crazy Talk in overdrive this stream

[1:22:27] <MMetas> making new lore for someone else
[1:22:28] <Maverick2736> Rivens DO have story tied to them, though. The big pyramid symbol thing on the rivens is the symbol of a cephalon that's tied to them
[1:22:31] <El_Samio> pat's MR 8 I think
[1:22:31] <Goldteddy> doesn't Riven just mean being split or broken!?
[1:22:31] <sub_par0> Is this Pat’s final form?
[1:22:36] <$ThePaleSage> @gr4ndm4rsh4ll you know damn well it’s inevitable
[1:22:38] <$PonyHearts> The best spoilers are the ones you don't realize are spoilers.

[1:33:34] <%InkblotBlues> Damn you, Pat! Stop reading donations!
[1:33:34] <%captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 So is vengeance greed anger lust love hope redemption family morals values ambition psychosis religion boredom eccentrism and destiny. There is literally no motive you can not say, "X is a crutch for this character type". That's my point, Motives are crutches for a narrative by the nature of their existance.
[1:33:35] <%maskedriderhero> Why are we freaking out? Did someone put spoilers in the donations?
[1:33:36] <+Vostroyan1> plague isnt in the chat
[1:33:36] <stron> its more like a 2 hour bus

[1:33:37] <+unfoldingchoas> is anyone going to buy this year tenno con awsome stuff?
[1:33:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Seattle is often defined as "extremo" and "popin"

[1:35:23] <JeromeX23> *2017-2018
[1:35:24] <+preppyposs> HE'S GOING TO SPOIL HIMSELF
[1:35:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> NO MORE READS THE SPOILERS
[1:35:26] <ArcanumMBD> are there actually spoilers in the donations or are people freaking out for nothing?
[1:35:29] <MMetas> G R O F I T
[1:35:32] <%maskedriderhero> Do we know if theres spoiilers in the donations, or are you all just freaking out because you assume?
[1:35:32] <Kratok> @WhereDoYouThinkWeAre people were donating spoilers
[1:35:36] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat STOP D:
[1:35:37] <feuddude> get the color pallets pat
[1:35:39] <deviljhojho94> @captainthunderwolf Of coure, I do not disagree. The thing is, it's such a boring archetype for a female character. Motherhood is one of the oldes tropes in history, and when even monsters in fiction are bound to be defined by motherhood, it's obviously going to seem more played out than the average crutch, know what im saying
[1:35:39] <startadevy> tip of the hat sir
[1:35:41] <+LegacyOfTheSith> pat should definitly tell woolie to get cassus fetts blaster in KoTOR Kappa

[1:35:53] <@PlagueOfGripes> I told him how to get them. He tried to get a single blueprint then gave up
[1:36:01] <%captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 That's a point I can agree with, yeah.
[1:36:04] <deviljhojho94> @lunar_decay the little plot we get is at the very least interesting
[1:36:05] <wowsandman> You gotta buy them potatoes
[1:36:05] <tangoragahn> Plague warn him!
[1:36:07] <+AXL808> He should invest plat in Nef Anyo, he makes amazing returns

[1:37:11] <+Vostroyan1> someone supposedly saw someone donate a spoiler
[1:37:12] <deanbees> It's the little cape. His guns. The crooked face. The whole package.
[1:37:13] <VectMachine> It helps that he's not overexposed as the others.
[1:37:14] <+Phobaws06> and now clem will be named space hodor

[1:37:36] <+FalconFlavoredPunch> Pat you got me and 2 of my friends to start Warframe!
[1:37:37] <Gorgen> i have so many clem noggles

[1:38:16] <Shwepie> Clem is great because he was born out of the community making fun of grineer saying, "Get clem!" instead of, "Get them!" Instead of the devs trying to force something to be funny, even if they are the ones who ultimately crystalized the meme.

[1:41:13] <reonome> GOOD JOB CHAT

[1:41:20] <miguelrod777> what a bitch doesn't know stoicism

[1:41:25] <Jaxnos> there wasnt. i said yabba why, yabba shrugged, and then someone started screaming about spoilers
[1:41:25] <tangoragahn> Trickle down emotions
[1:41:26] <Karhax> stoicism is dumb
[1:41:29] <startadevy> aristotle
[1:41:29] <+JavaManJoJo> turns out we were the spoilers we made along the way
[1:41:29] <+VariantX7> Ok, I just took a piss and what the fuck is pat is talking about?
[1:41:30] <lsandoval2020> Let it sizzle

[1:41:34] <puddingpants88> oh god smart talk!!!
[1:41:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> thats smart
[1:41:39] <%captainthunderwolf> @rdark_ksu Stoicism is useful, but I'm a fan of pragmatism and idealism as a pair. Have high goals, do realistically useful things to get to them.
[1:41:46] <%MisterCrimson> Satanists
[1:41:47] <Captainahab_37> Warframe fuckin confused me when I played it
[1:41:47] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat basically im a crazy person and pat just ignore me. thanks for what ya do
[1:41:48] <+AntithesisEK> hedonists
[1:41:48] <%Dingus_Tickler> aka Don't let it set in
[1:41:48] <+zaras00> "read books dont jack off"
[1:41:49] <AlfredoCavatelli> hedonists
[1:41:49] <%captainthunderwolf> Hedonists.
[1:41:51] <grayjammer> Hedonists
[1:41:51] <tUxUt> hedonists
[1:41:52] <Spydurman> hedonist
[1:41:52] <%ReidTheReader> Hedonistis
[1:41:53] <%Remery_> Broism?
[1:41:56] <puddingpants88> libertarians?
[1:41:58] <+WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> Hedonists
[1:41:59] <$Chimeraelite> Sounds like Satanism
[1:41:59] <+TeethMuncher> idk, the pursuit of pleasure is pretty good
[1:42:00] <%Keeble24> apatBig
[1:42:00] <+AXL808> Isn't it like "thank god that didn't happen to me"?
[1:42:01] <JDebss> not if it's a bad thing to do
[1:42:03] <JDebss> got it
[1:42:03] <BaronVonWolfe> everybody else?
[1:42:05] <zakti_prime> common sense
[1:42:05] <aeonicvector> Hedonists or Marists in SMT
[1:42:05] <RossMirage> Did he just complete Natah?
[1:42:06] <%ReidTheReader> But like hedonists get like a bad rap
[1:42:07] <+AntithesisEK> @puddingpants88 LUL
[1:42:09] <TheNeedlesD> Pat is advocating a lot of things
[1:42:10] <sjcodan> Like the gout
[1:42:11] <El_Samio> Epicureans, Cyrenaics
[1:42:11] <+Bang_Doll> Libertines?
[1:42:12] <+gessho> thats totally satanism
[1:42:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ded
[1:42:13] <%deadpalvgz> like being dead
[1:42:13] <%InkblotBlues> Or gout
[1:42:14] <+grandCurator> @rossmirage yes
[1:42:14] <$Chimeraelite> that's legic Satanism. You do you, don't fuck with other people.
[1:42:15] <+TeethMuncher> or gout
[1:42:16] <prismaticsnake> candy is death
[1:42:16] <DantesAnimus> Stoics were kinda lame tho. were real judgy about the Romans murder theatres.
[1:42:17] <GimmieGarbage> sonic fans
[1:42:17] <Captainahab_37> What if it fucks me up but in a really fun way
[1:42:20] <Katalist_> But I'd have the candy NOW and be dead later...
[1:42:21] <tangoragahn> It's no existialism I tell ya what
[1:42:22] <@thenefftw> Let's get to that fucking Second Dream!
[1:42:23] <$Chimeraelite> Satan is a chill dude my guy
[1:42:23] <%ReidTheReader> But im all for hedonism hense why im drunk off my ass atm
[1:42:26] <Sol_Install> BUt we'll all gonna die sooner or later so candy now
[1:42:27] <Misericordia92> Slanesh objects, pleasure is life
[1:42:29] <+Cobra743> OH THANK CRIST
[1:42:30] <MC_GigglePants> Second Dream HYPE
[1:42:31] <%captainthunderwolf> Hedonism ironically isn't about pursuing pleasure solely, it's actually about pursuing joy from the simple things in life and avoiding extravangance.
[1:42:31] <+Punchasaur> also called true anarchy
[1:42:32] <LuxCelestia> Yay spoiler-free again!
[1:42:32] <%Wurd> PogChamp No Spoils

[1:42:42] <+AXL808> not eat candy now so you can spend $100 on plat later
[1:42:45] <%captainthunderwolf> Pouring a wine bottle into your ass at an orgy isn't hedonism classically, for instance.
[1:42:46] <@PlagueOfGripes> didn't seem like any spoilers to me. dunno what you guys were flipping out about
[1:42:46] <ThePuddingDead> I alt tab for several minutes and he's STILL on this screen? Pat ya silly dude!

[2:02:31] <Zoh87> uh oh
[2:02:36] <+ccwettr123> holy shit 'heart of gold' does that imply that Stalker actually IS an orokin?
[2:02:37] <TropicalPsychosis> sharkwing inbound
[2:02:37] <deanbees> I wonder if that's literal since everything orokin related is always PLASTERED in it
[2:02:38] <+windiwindi> the waypoint system in this game used to be so much worse lol...
[2:02:39] <@thenefftw> GET SWIMMING, BITCH

[2:02:54] <FirewallStorm> LUL
[2:02:56] <+coolthulhuu> ooh good foreshadowing
[2:02:56] <IminyourBase> everyone hates the archwing! it's so universal
[2:02:56] <Cobalt_Racer> time for pat to get lost
[2:02:58] <+AXL808> Everyone's favorite gamemode
[2:03:00] <+Ciphris> hard to be a ninja under water
[2:03:02] <+VariantX7> "undah da see.. unda da see"

[2:03:10] <MMetas> INTO THE WATER
[2:03:13] <Zoh87> are archwing weapon parts only from syndicates?
[2:03:18] <MMetas> FIGHT THE ENEMIES IN THE WATER
[2:03:19] <+AXL808> Rhino skin will not help you here
[2:03:23] <Zoh87> Thats the biggest reason I never got into them
[2:03:23] <grayjammer> Get outta here Underwater Stalker
[2:03:24] <cizal11> some are from clans i think
[2:03:25] <El_Samio> he says now
[2:03:25] <+TeethMuncher> @MMetas live there, die there?
[2:03:27] <cizal11> but most are syndicate
[2:03:27] <VideoRanger47> @Jaxterpeace is sitting here next to me criticizing every little thing pat does because he has 1000 hrs in game and it's hilarious
[2:03:31] <MC_GigglePants> Nah Corpus hacking is way easier
[2:03:33] <%ReidTheReader> I cant keep up...I'm a little too gone for this game...
[2:03:36] <+windiwindi> @Zoh87 no it's an alternative method to getting them
[2:03:42] <+DontMindMee> corpus is easy if you go for the "3 line" ones first
[2:03:44] <+DZiffer> That's why the Corpus are the tech guys
[2:03:45] <Cobalt_Racer> @IminyourBase EXCUSE me, archwing is great, it's sharkwing that's complete garbage
[2:03:45] <+nekomancerer> I wanna see the fram... go into the water

[2:08:11] <MMetas> you can't prove nothing
[2:08:12] <Worldbrand> The grineer are sympathetic huh
[2:08:12] <Cobalt_Racer> >sympathetic LUL
[2:08:13] <MC_GigglePants> The Perrin Sequence on the only Corpus bros
[2:08:14] <Garrison27> Are we the baddies?
[2:08:16] <El_Samio> there are good guys in warframe: Clem
[2:08:18] <startadevy> hehe
[2:08:19] <deanbees> MAYBE they deserved it
[2:08:19] <GodlyLuigi> "We aren't the good guys anymore"
[2:08:26] <cervidaequus> "considering that we're committing genocide..... hmm............."
[2:08:29] <LuxCelestia> Darvo's pretty nice, actually
[2:08:30] <+zork990> the orokin were assholes
[2:08:30] <Grayhammatter> is clem the good guy?
[2:08:31] <$RaikenTB> are we the new people?
[2:08:32] <%ReidTheReader> I mean maybe everyones an asshole
[2:08:32] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> You commit genocide every five minutes
[2:08:32] <+JavaManJoJo> We should just leave the universe to the Cephalons
[2:08:32] <Kratok> Grineer queens, very sympathetic
[2:08:33] <+MajorCrasher> They're fucking huge
[2:08:34] <+AXL808> Do really think your good if you're using ninjas to do your dirty work?
[2:08:36] <+HRDSalami654> They'r'e fucking huge.
[2:08:37] <shockedb2> youll understand in a bit
[2:08:37] <tangoragahn> Oops! All reservoir!
[2:08:45] <Kerozero> And they are fuckin BIIIIG.
[2:08:47] <Zoh87> "they"
[2:08:48] <urs0jb> play inaros' quest to know who is the real bad guy
[2:08:49] <powerprotoman> pat jsut remember "GROFIT"
[2:08:49] <+TeethMuncher> He's thinking in real time
[2:08:51] <zakti_prime> when you get more lore about everything the Orokin have done....
[2:08:51] <%Darsis> time for a lore vid on youtube after this mission lol
[2:08:51] <turbulentstriker> Who cares, my dude, it's all about getting P A I D
[2:08:52] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat you know the plains of cetus? that's all one sentient
[2:08:58] <+preppyposs> GROFIT
[2:08:59] <TropicalPsychosis> yeah, Orokin society was cool. Besides the child murder, and child armies
[2:08:59] <Shwepie> Tenno actually protect the system from getting the Sentients attention by being assholes and making sure no one gets too advanced/powerful.
[2:09:00] <tangoragahn> It's o-kay Homah
[2:09:03] <DantesAnimus> Ur guy looked so confused there for a secc
[2:09:05] <+migofrompluto> Darvo is best Corpus Bro :P
[2:09:05] <MMetas> Look at those sentients lodged deep into uranus
[2:09:05] <%InkblotBlues> Can't wait. here it comes
[2:09:05] <RossMirage> Ask Vaati to make Warframe vids
[2:09:06] <AtlasMcCoy> The biggest one
[2:09:06] <+Kirbachev> @Kratok They're a bunch of dumbass brainwashed clones with no agency, and the ones that DO manage to break away get a hard time of it. It's not hard to feel a little bad for them considering how much shit your regular Grineer grunt has to deal with.
[2:09:08] <MMetas> doesn't that hurt?
[2:09:09] <El_Samio> do chains of harrow + spaceroom to know who the real bad guy is
[2:09:10] <Volkrotia> B I G REVEALS
[2:09:15] <Maverick2736> all will be revealed eventually...
[2:09:16] <corn_on_fire> "wait are we evil?... lol w/e man i'm gonna go hang out in my space dojo!"
[2:09:19] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> WELLLL NOT WRONG
[2:09:20] <tierney12> the sad thing is that pat won't learn all this lore by playing the game FeelsBadMan
[2:09:20] <+migofrompluto> Its not a ship
[2:09:27] <+plzdodge> I'm playing warframe right now and I'm stuck on getting all the dumb codex
[2:09:27] <MMetas> HE AIN'T EVEN WRONG
[2:09:29] <@PlagueOfGripes> fuck offffffffff SALAD
[2:09:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> but the orokin couldn't be assholes, they made giant fancy gold things that shot lasers in all directions for no reason
[2:09:34] <Zoh87> bye salad
[2:09:35] <deviljhojho94> GTFO rich jackass
[2:09:36] <Kerozero> I love Alad V in this questline

[2:10:02] <faegbeard> y e y e y e y e here we go
[2:10:03] <Kratok> @Kirbachev yeaah, but we're kind of talking about their acting forces, just as the Pat Tenno can't be evil just because he doesn't know what the Tenno do, but the Tenno can be evil
[2:10:03] <+DZiffer> Yea, Alad is pretty much Frieza
[2:10:06] <+migofrompluto> NO he hasn't revealed one of the big spoilers yet
[2:10:06] <+preppyposs> ITS TIME
[2:10:09] <+QuadraticGravity> Oh NOOOO
[2:10:09] <%ReidTheReader> Man this was a bad moment to try to jump into warframe lore...
[2:10:13] <MMetas> Here we go
[2:10:14] <zakti_prime> salad chan is great in this
[2:10:16] <tierney12> did anyone clip pat's first experience with the stalker?
[2:10:16] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> I should proooobably play this already so that I know what's going on...
[2:10:18] <%Cynful_Pleasures> THAT"S NO SHIP
[2:10:23] <deviljhojho94> S T Y L E
[2:10:34] <ivansonic08> Alad is generic mad scientist #2
[2:10:34] <Divryne> Yo Tenno it was a prank. Look the camera's right there.
[2:10:35] <+CammyEXE> I'm so hype for Pat to finish this quest
[2:10:37] <+CammyEXE> Oh man
[2:10:42] <BaronVonWolfe> @amaniisyourboss YES
[2:10:43] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @cynful_pleasures careful now lol
[2:10:49] <LuxCelestia> @AmaniIsYourBoss You'll be incredibly spoiled if you keep going.

[2:10:56] <+CammyEXE> @AmaniIsYourBoss Stop watching! Go finish it now
[2:10:57] <Divryne> SAVE.
[2:11:01] <tangoragahn> Its time for Pat to face the ULTIMATE BIOWEAPON
[2:11:03] <%Darsis> Next friendcast is going to be fun with him trying to talk about this
[2:11:04] <Twoiis> I had to cheese the battlyst.
[2:11:07] <zcairstrike> I'm so hyped to see Pat's brain melt out of his ears.
[2:11:14] <inderf> oh man i havent watched him play any of this so far but it seems i jumped in at the best part
[2:11:15] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Got it. I'll bow out for now. Good luck Patty!
[2:11:19] <MMetas> Nailed it
[2:11:20] <%Imperial_Madman> very fair

[2:11:31] <deanbees> FOOT TO FACE STYLE
[2:11:32] <+Kirbachev> @Kratok Yeah, true. That said, it's a very morally grey setting. About the only faction that's out-and-out evil is the one Pat's dealing with right now.
[2:11:32] <tierney12> you won't owe alad v jack because you missed the event LUL
[2:11:34] <ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat Your Rhino looks pretty dope dude

[2:12:28] <glacialbluebird> *mario voice* HERE WE GOOOO-
[2:12:29] <+Dasbubba> @Fadedsaint8 You can pull off some fast cool stuff with mouse and keyboard for how fast this game is. But it plays finewith a controller
[2:12:29] <miguelrod777> punch it

[2:12:33] <MMetas> Look at htat armor melt

[2:12:42] <MadOx__> this thing is a fuckin bitch
[2:12:42] <TypicalTechNinja> What she said?
[2:12:43] <Kratok> I had to make a magical swords that could combo lock one sentient at a time for some of theme missions
[2:12:43] <+ccwettr123> welp, this just became a 10 minute fight
[2:12:44] <LuxCelestia> He's doing pretty good!
[2:12:44] <+DontMindMee> charge him?
[2:12:45] <deviljhojho94> BIG WIPEOUTS
[2:12:47] <ThePuddingDead> try using ur abilities
[2:12:53] <TypicalTechNinja> "You went right through me"
[2:12:54] <+VariantX7> they're a pain in the ass until you finish the quest
[2:12:55] <MC_GigglePants> Battalysts are such fucking garbage
[2:12:55] <cizal11> this is working pretty well though
[2:12:55] <+coolthulhuu> its not tooo ahrd to brute force it
[2:12:57] <+Phobaws06> YES
[2:12:58] <deanbees> THERE HE GOES

[2:13:02] <+migofrompluto> Rhino doesn't have much in the way of offensive abilities
[2:13:02] <DantesAnimus> that thing looks friggin weird
[2:13:03] <+AXL808> they're tough
[2:13:04] <drakthebest> When I did this I had limbo. I just went into limbo and then summoned a specter and AFKd for 10 minutes

[2:13:05] <AtlasMcCoy> Boy it sure was fun having to fight DOZENS OF THESE FUCKS
[2:13:05] <%djinnJuice> does he just not have any damage variance?
[2:13:06] <NoxinPistol> It adapts to the element of your weapon.
[2:13:07] <MMetas> DISCOBALL
[2:13:08] <+Kirbachev> These things are just a fucking annoyance.
[2:13:15] <+Phobaws06> Now you are thinking with roars
[2:13:16] <TypicalTechNinja> I love the second dream!!!
[2:13:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> punch him sometimes
[2:13:18] <%lunar_decay> RHINO OP

[2:13:29] <+zork990> yeah you want weapons with different elemental damage mods on
[2:13:30] <grayjammer> Hey remember in Octavia's Anthem when there was like, 10 of these >:(
[2:13:33] <+Dasbubba> that took me a while when i did it
[2:13:33] <+JavaManJoJo> not bad honestly
[2:13:34] <deviljhojho94> Incredible
[2:13:35] <cizal11> that went SO much better than when i did it lmfao

[2:13:51] <Shinmaddrox> He gets 95% immunity to 5 attack types.
[2:13:53] <sjcodan> No they arent
[2:13:54] <tierney12> incredible? we used to make void keys in the hundreds LUL
[2:13:54] <Jaxterpeace> Would be easier with a child to blast it
[2:13:59] <+JavaManJoJo> THEY USE THE KEYS WHEN THEY KNOW THEY ARE NOT PURE
[2:14:01] <tangoragahn> Remember that key fact

[2:34:12] <%rdark_ksu> ok that is a pretty good twist. gave shamaladingdong a good run
[2:34:14] <+CrimsonCore90> It explains ordis as well
[2:34:21] <Silly_Duckling> considering you can SWITCH BETWEEN WARFRAMES and that they have DIFFERENT BODY TYPES, it's not that surprising
[2:34:24] <Gorgen> Space orphan time

[2:38:09] <cizal11> HE'S KINDA SHIT YEAH IT'S OK
[2:38:09] <%captainthunderwolf> @CrimsonCore90 I think the way the reveal HAPPENS is what makes it interesting. Your name means "Operator", your Warframe's body glitches out and falls down when you find the secret which is actually YOU, etcetera.

[2:51:55] <+PenmanLupine> You know, knowing that this happens after all of this would get Woolie the FUCK in but its such a HUGE spoiler he would hate knowing it.
[2:51:57] <+AntithesisEK> this is not a drill or memeposting Zenurik is VERY important and recent changes made it better than original implementation @AngriestPat
[2:51:57] <CptHarlok> Zenurik is definitely the most immediately useful.
[2:51:58] <El_Samio> Naramon bois up in here

[2:52:28] <deanbees> what
[2:52:28] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> FORCE CHOKE
[2:52:28] <uhavebadpc> zenurik far outweighs the other focus schools
[2:52:35] <Worldbrand> these descriptions honestly have nothing to do with the powers
[2:52:35] <Prostipate> ...you chose fast
[2:52:35] <%ReidTheReader> PogChamp Picked good one

[2:52:50] <Maverick2736> holy shit, he actually picked out the best one by himself
[2:52:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> zenurik is the most useful school until the endgame
[2:52:54] <cizal11> boy this child voice is bad, but they kind of all are
[2:52:58] <faegbeard> My warframe is STRONG
[2:52:59] <$Bncbck> INFINITE MAGIC

[2:54:19] <%deadpalvgz> THE OROKIN WERE AWFUL
[2:54:21] <%InkblotBlues> This game is fucking free.
[2:54:22] <%deadpalvgz> AND KILLED MARGUELLIS
[2:54:22] <MMetas> plague can proceed to yell at him
[2:54:23] <RevenTheLight> shut up
[2:54:23] <El_Samio> because the OROKIN = DICKS
[2:54:24] <+Cobra743> read your codex entries
[2:54:25] <urs0jb> play inaros' quest to know why
[2:54:26] <mercado94> WAT
[2:54:26] <+zork990> because the orokin killed margulis
[2:54:26] <Cyphereous> URGE TO SPOILER HHNNNNGHGH
[2:54:27] <MMetas> PAT STOP LOOKING AT THAT
[2:54:28] <zakti_prime> are we kids or squids
[2:54:29] <Shinmaddrox> Orokin are shits
[2:54:29] <startadevy> titties
[2:54:29] <NemokillerV> the orokin were huge dicks
[2:54:29] <+TherrexNSV> WAR WITHIN NEXT BABYYYYYYY
[2:54:29] <+boredpantz> Read the CODEX
[2:54:29] <Divryne> THEY KILLED THEIR MOM.
[2:54:30] <ghostcarnival> you'd prolly kill your evil uncle too
[2:54:30] <%Darsis> got to save the Baby
[2:54:31] <Caidezes> KIDS WITH STANDS
[2:54:32] <Derkinstacker> You're a standard mecha pilot in any gundam anime.
[2:54:33] <+JavaManJoJo> Yeah orokin were pretty bad
[2:54:33] <+jojonotcrash> what is even this game
[2:54:34] <$Bncbck> they decided to purge the kids
[2:54:34] <MMetas> PAT PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR NEW CHILD
[2:54:35] <%MisterCrimson> Also, where's the Stalker?
[2:54:37] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> The Orokin went bad
[2:54:37] <Worldbrand> because the lotus told them to
[2:54:38] <Fabric_tester> @angriestpat READ RHINO PRIME DETAILS
[2:54:38] <Shinmaddrox> Mind dominating shits
[2:54:39] <sunriser696> PERSONAS
[2:54:39] <BaronVonWolfe> Hey guess what? Now you gotta do War Within.
[2:54:40] <UvBenServed> The Orokin have a habit of making weapons they can't control
[2:54:41] <+zork990> they killed the og space mom
[2:54:44] <Goldteddy> Again i point out....that Tenno was the last name of the protagonist of Dark Sector Hayden Tenno
[2:54:47] <+Sinetha> Isn't it fucking rad?
[2:54:49] <+Phobaws06> He'll love ordis backstory
[2:54:52] <MMetas> Is this the OTHER BABY Paige was alluding to?
[2:54:52] <+Dasbubba> Tenno also means 'Heavenly Emperor" in Japanese
[2:54:59] <+K9TBJaeger> Lotus made us do it and was suppose to kill us
[2:55:07] <+AXL808> With the Orokin you're talking about a race that used clone slaves to build their empire, child soldiers are not far from that
[2:55:15] <$serpenttucker> Nope
[2:55:19] <+migofrompluto> Ooh man, I can't ask my question because its about Ballas >.<
[2:55:19] <+preppyposs> no it's just so you don't have to see your face
[2:55:20] <Mrchuckquizmo> Looks like a lotus flower
[2:55:26] <+ruddyredbone> nah it just makes you look cool
[2:55:27] <%Darsis> my tenno has Oni horns <:D
[2:55:31] <zakti_prime> the Orokin killed their mom, the kids killed them back
[2:55:31] <%spacekataz18> The fleshy clothes
[2:55:33] <@thenefftw> It's so stupid, I love it
[2:55:37] <+gozzojt27> It’s a bit odd seeing the lotus huh? Considering recent events
[2:55:40] <+TeethMuncher> It's because you're 10 years old Kappa
[2:55:46] <+DecoDillo> I hope he does the war within to get the rest of the abilities
[2:55:47] <Kratok> EVERYTHING IS PART OF THE PLOT
[2:55:48] <+preppyposs> YEYEYEYE
[2:55:49] <Shinmaddrox> Everything in this game is like Mecha flesh
[2:55:51] <MMetas> jesus does pat literally have 5k plat
[2:55:53] <+DecoDillo> So he can run around the map as a shit kid
[2:55:53] <+Ciphris> my tenno had pink hair and horns before darling in the franxx happened

[2:56:00] <+MarshallLee67> ye boi
[2:56:02] <Prostipate> .........
[2:56:03] <Maverick2736> Orokin create the Tenno to save themselves from the Sentients > Tenno win war vs Sentients and then wipe the fuck out of the Orokin too for being dicks

[2:59:18] <+DontMindMee> @AngriestPat So when you completed the mission you got a "Lens". You insert these into warframes. While you use that warframe, you acquire Focus for that school
[2:59:22] <%InkblotBlues> "only"
[2:59:23] <AtlasMcCoy> broken war super good
[2:59:24] <Cobaltor_252> SUIT
[2:59:26] <MidnightCrow> customize your suit pat @angriestpat
[2:59:27] <Shinmaddrox> You need to put the Zenarik Focus on your frame.

[2:59:39] <+ccwettr123> @AnimatronicNightmare it's not "main", but it does go into a LOT about Marghulis
[2:59:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> I thought broken war came with a potato? can't remember

[2:59:47] <+President_Miyazaki> Pat literally always mod
[2:59:48] <Derkinstacker> THE LENS
[2:59:48] <applesonthemoon> i keep screaming but god wont answer
[2:59:48] <not_machoman> Plague, you gotta tell him about the suit
[2:59:48] <EASrake> what why
[2:59:49] <+MarshallLee67> it does @PlagueOfGripes
[2:59:49] <sunny935> plague needs to yell for us
[2:59:49] <AlfredoCavatelli> broken war is the fucking best
[2:59:50] <MadOx__> @PlagueOfGripes yes it does
[2:59:50] <El_Samio> Broken War comes with potato, yes
[2:59:50] <Worldbrand> It is potatoed, he's MR8
[2:59:52] <$magikestral> he's still ignoring chat, but plague messaged him about it I think
[2:59:53] <+JavaManJoJo> ???
[2:59:53] <%Cityscape17> Suit up!
[2:59:54] <Flightedwings> He cant read guys
[2:59:54] <+skibbz_> LUL
[2:59:57] <+Nephthyz> @PlagueOfGripes Tell him to customize his suit.
[2:59:58] <Cobalt_Racer> it's the best single sword in the game
[2:59:59] <TheKingBroseidon> pat doesn't get modding yet it looks like
[2:59:59] <+zork990> go back to tenno customization
[3:00:01] <cizal11> PAT THE MODS ARE LITERALLY A WEAPONS POWER WHAT ARE YOU DOING
[3:00:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> if you buy the frost prime deluxe skin, you get a reasonably cheddar skin
[3:00:02] <%InkblotBlues> BUT WHY?! Why are you like this?!
[3:00:03] <Cobalt_Racer> probably
[3:00:05] <Zoh87> ohhhh nooo
[3:00:05] <tierney12> @PlagueOfGripes it does come wth a potato
[3:00:08] <AlfredoCavatelli> war within is the second tutorial
[3:00:10] <@thenefftw> Pat, you always put in mods
[3:00:10] <+AXL808> war within war within war within
[3:00:13] <Derkinstacker> Tell him to put the lens on.
[3:00:15] <LuxCelestia> bab
[3:00:15] <+Captfresh> WAR WITHIN!!!
[3:00:16] <MC_GigglePants> I'm glad Pat tests new weapons the same way I do
[3:00:19] <Worldbrand> is he not going to mod it? at all?
[3:00:20] <Forshino> YOU HAVE TO DO THE WAR WITHIN
[3:00:22] <BaronVonWolfe> @plagueofgripes HELP US YELL AT PAT!
[3:00:23] <$Pacohax> yeah, hopefully he streams war within
[3:00:25] <Zombrocom> Broken war does have it;s own built in stance so this works out actually
[3:00:26] <+unfoldingchoas> War Within time
[3:00:27] <cizal11> he can't do war within for awhile
[3:00:27] <gunsrlove> @PlagueOfGripes you must save it again
[3:00:28] <+DZiffer> But you have even equipped a stance...
[3:00:30] <+TeethMuncher> Put your lenses, nothing can go wrong
[3:00:31] <@thenefftw> He can't do War Within for a while now
[3:00:32] <+MGKBurrito> wait WHAT
[3:00:32] <@PlagueOfGripes> calm down
[3:00:33] <cizal11> maybe tomorrow at best
[3:00:47] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> oh I forgot you got Revenant by default
[3:00:49] <+Captfresh> WAR WITHIN
[3:00:49] <T_Sasquatch> I've not accomplished anything in this game NotLikeThis
[3:00:49] <+AntithesisEK> Innate to the weapon.
[3:00:50] <%Darsis> lol
[3:00:50] <startadevy> buying it
[3:00:50] <drakthebest> He won't be able to do war within for a while, or at least until he gets the next junction
[3:00:51] <+MarshallLee67> lol
[3:00:51] <+Sinetha> LUL
[3:00:52] <Maverick2736> @PlagueOfGripes tell him to never sell it, since it's a requirement to be able to build the full War greatsword
[3:00:53] <+windiwindi> that stance sounds cool but crimson dervish is still better imo
[3:00:53] <Cyphereous> @PlagueOfGripes The hype train is off the rails, it cannot be contained
[3:00:54] <+jorgamund> @PlagueOfGripes but he's not playing the game how we want him to! this is SERIOUS BUSINESS
[3:00:54] <OneGorillionDollars> it has its own stance if you dont put one on
[3:00:54] <Worldbrand> That's a thing that a lot of people dont know!
[3:00:56] <$Vanessa_Ui> cheer300 Please go back and hit the shoulder buttons when you are at the child menu.
[3:00:58] <$Bncbck> secret weapon stance!
[3:00:58] <%SaltyDongs> @PlagueOfGripes call him A hammer dweeb
[3:00:58] <CptHarlok> PRESS 5
[3:00:59] <NMEDom> SUPER!
[3:01:01] <+JavaManJoJo> SYSTEMS
[3:01:01] <+Nephthyz> Wait, there are default stance names?
[3:01:03] <acridPaladin> Oh yea hes gotta let it charge
[3:01:07] <crazyscottnb> get some kills
[3:01:08] <+Bear_pawsv7> Ultra meter
[3:01:10] <%InkblotBlues> Your Ultimate is charging
[3:01:10] <MC_GigglePants> Broken War's default combo chain uses the Vengeful revenant stance if no other stance is equipped.
[3:01:17] <+migofrompluto> There are Stance mods
[3:01:18] <Banjoboozle> Pat's never been more confused
[3:01:19] <+MrMcCrabby> Your Ultimate is charing
[3:01:21] <+FarrisOfThemAll> This sword has a different stance for its default stance if you don't equip one. The full stance is a rare as fuck drop
[3:01:25] <+JavaManJoJo> Lol, his face is so good
[3:01:26] <@PlagueOfGripes> he can't go operator yet
[3:01:27] <shevan123> both
[3:01:28] <Shinmaddrox> Builds with affinity
[3:01:28] <UvBenServed> Oh, that's still a thing?
[3:01:30] <+mozartdminor> is chest laser still a thing?
[3:01:32] <NMEDom> ULTRAS ! @AngriestPat
[3:01:33] <+DecoDillo> 2 minutes
[3:01:33] <megabman> time
[3:01:38] <+JavaManJoJo> @PlagueOfGripes He does the old chest beam for now
[3:01:43] <Maverick2736> is chest lazor still a thing?
[3:01:44] <+MikoNoPants> Broken war is also compatible with Vengeful revenant stance mod
[3:01:44] <+babyacid> just time
[3:01:47] <+MetroidHunter26> Chest Lazer is still a thing until y ou finish War Within
[3:01:48] <Worldbrand> Actually Plague, there's a thing he can do in between the second dream and the war within
[3:01:48] <@PlagueOfGripes> I forgot the chest beam even existed.
[3:01:51] <+MikoNoPants> it has the polarity for it
[3:01:56] <%SaltyDongs> amazing wiffs
[3:01:57] <+MGKBurrito> carebear stare
[3:02:00] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @mozartdminor Only for people who haven't done tww
[3:02:01] <+Nephthyz> I never even used the chest beam before I finished War Within.

[3:02:22] <Zoh87> It used to be something else, I think old old zen was a big confuse aoe thing
[3:02:22] <Misericordia92> chest beam so strong, it kills stalker real fast
[3:02:23] <@PlagueOfGripes> :-|

[3:04:36] <CptHarlok> LOL
[3:04:37] <Derkinstacker> Rip lens
[3:04:39] <%Flamekidx> buy another
[3:04:39] <@PlagueOfGripes> not the worst decision he could have made
[3:04:39] <+TeethMuncher> WE DID IT
[3:04:41] <+AXL808> d'oh!
[3:04:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> FUCK
[3:04:41] <PsychedelicSnake> This is exactly what I wanted
[3:04:42] <+windiwindi> rip a roo lol!
[3:04:42] <+skibbz_> better off putting greater lenses on frames anyway it's fine
[3:04:42] <IminyourBase> should have put it on the warframe
[3:04:43] <%InkblotBlues> Well. Not like you can't get more on Cetus.
[3:04:44] <El_Samio> he got enough plat to buiy another lens
[3:04:44] <inderf> its fine
[3:04:44] <+unfoldingchoas> rip lens
[3:04:45] <+TardyClock> The Hek is pretty good
[3:04:45] <RoninGarrison> oh well lol
[3:04:46] <+FarrisOfThemAll> He has 5k plat he can just buy more
[3:04:46] <Kratok> SO much easier to get lenses nowadays
[3:04:46] <%Flamekidx> hes got a bajillion plat
[3:04:47] <cizal11> in fairness he can use the hek for a long time
[3:04:47] <OkamiDude15> LUL
[3:04:48] <Karhax> rip
[3:04:48] <%SandNoodle> rip
[3:04:49] <+zork990> he can always farm lenses
[3:04:49] <waleryn> Let him make his own mistakes, its more adorable that way
[3:04:49] <+migofrompluto> He is probably going to be using the Hek for awhile
[3:04:49] <Zoh87> lenses arent that rare anymore
[3:04:50] <RoninGarrison> Lol
[3:04:50] <Maverick2736> IT'S FIIIIINE CHAT
[3:04:50] <+preppyposs> Heks fine
[3:04:50] <EASrake> LUL
[3:04:51] <StynCity> heh
[3:04:51] <TheKingBroseidon> LUL
[3:04:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LOOOOL
[3:04:52] <applesonthemoon> LUL
[3:04:54] <Kratok> Heheheh
[3:04:55] <glacialbluebird> LOL
[3:04:55] <KingOfTheGeats> lmao
[3:04:55] <PsychedelicSnake> LUL
[3:04:55] <cizal11> it's good for a really really long time
[3:04:55] <+zork990> you can get lenses from bounties
[3:04:55] <CronoMagnum> Putting the lens on a Hek isn't a bad choice
[3:04:55] <+Alrockson> LuL
[3:04:56] <IminyourBase> HEK OFF YOU IDIOT THAT WAS A WASTE
[3:04:56] <faegbeard> hek = kek
[3:04:58] <NoxinPistol> Hek's pretty good.
[3:04:58] <OneGorillionDollars> jesus take the wheeeeeeeel
[3:04:58] <+unfoldingchoas> maybe should put on rhino
[3:04:59] <Katalist_> good thing Kappa
[3:04:59] <acridPaladin> What a hek of a waste
[3:05:00] <%Daigrey> you can get more on plains
[3:05:01] <CronoMagnum> Thing is endgame viable
[3:05:04] <powerprotoman> if pat looked at the chat hed realzied he did a bad
[3:05:04] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> lenses are common now, we are just reacting with old rarity of lenses
[3:05:05] <sunny935> he is going to regret it later on
[3:05:06] <+QuadraticGravity> oh heck
[3:05:07] <crazyscottnb> go explore lua after
[3:05:07] <%Flamekidx> buy more lens
[3:05:09] <deanbees> I mean, it's just a regular lens
[3:05:10] <zakti_prime> grind the Cetus bounties, nbd
[3:05:10] <General_Terro> literal brain damage
[3:05:11] <Worldbrand> Well the Hek does have the augment so it does compete with the vaykor hek
[3:05:12] <+Nephthyz> Isn't Vaykor Hek much better?
[3:05:12] <%Ele_On_A_Uni> i'm mr 23 and i still use the hek, that was a fine use for it
[3:05:13] <RoninGarrison> what the hek could go wrong? >.>
[3:05:14] <Jaxterpeace> Its easier to farm lenses now so its fine
[3:05:14] <anon_1307> the suit
[3:05:16] <LuxCelestia> Hek's pretty viable though
[3:05:18] <+AXL808> oh well, it's not like he doesn't have 5,000+ plat to burn
[3:05:19] <chowdah101> oh.. he actually did it. what a waste
[3:05:20] <Forshino> I hate the focus minigame so much
[3:05:20] <drakthebest> Now do a lua spy mission
[3:05:21] <cizal11> still didn't upgrade the sword......................
[3:05:21] <IminyourBase> you toss guns like candy in this game. you should have put it on the frame you goof
[3:05:24] <+Phobaws06> Now cetus will be a thing
[3:05:25] <Shinmaddrox> Now every kill you get with the HEK converts your affinity to focus. But only like 7% conversion
[3:05:27] <+Octumn> No lol
[3:05:29] <NMEDom> ULTRA ULTRA ULTRA!
[3:05:29] <zcairstrike> Pat, no, come on.
[3:05:32] <@thenefftw> No
[3:05:33] <+JavaManJoJo> Always better on a frame though because of how the exp splitting works
[3:05:38] <Zackdag> @PlagueOfGripes Please for our sake tell him about the outfits
[3:05:38] <+Castle_Kundarak> I can see how you'd come to that assumption.
[3:05:39] <PsychedelicSnake> 2 + 2 = 5
[3:05:41] <GodlyLuigi> guys pat isnt reading chat because he doesnt want back seatingin his game experience
[3:05:44] <Derkinstacker> @PlagueOfGripes after this you gotta sit him down and have a long talk.
[3:05:45] <Zombrocom> NOT AT ALL, but that's fine it doesn't really explain it
[3:05:49] <Worldbrand> One day someone's gonna have to explain affinity split to him
[3:05:50] <+FarrisOfThemAll> @Shinmaddrox more like 1% lol
[3:05:51] <BigRooster83> Use the Woolie slime
[3:05:57] <+TeethMuncher> @PsychedelicSnake 2 + 2 = 6 duh
[3:06:04] <+windiwindi> the amount of focus you get is like nothing. It's either 3% or 0.3% of the exp
[3:06:05] <@thenefftw> @GodlyLuigi That doesn't make this any less frustrating
[3:06:07] <$Bncbck> and it's ok, he only has 4000 platinum to get more lenses anyway
[3:06:13] <cizal11> lmfao
[3:06:17] <Shinmaddrox> Depends on rank of Lens and amount of lens you have @FarrisOfThemAll
[3:06:19] <+MetroidHunter26> Excess XP goes from your weapon to your Operator
[3:06:21] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> He's figuring it out pretty fat
[3:06:21] <+unfoldingchoas> @zeggazegga yes and no, vaykor hek has less amount of ammo, and hek can get a mod to do a awesome ability
[3:06:23] <GodlyLuigi> well he's never played the fucking game before and is learning everything for the first time
[3:06:26] <PsychedelicSnake> What BARS are these
[3:06:26] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> *fast
[3:06:26] <@PlagueOfGripes> trying to phrase things is a very basic way so it's not overwhelming
[3:06:27] <+Phobaws06> Its a share XP
[3:06:34] <zakti_prime> oh plague u gonna have give this lad a talk about focus and affinity
[3:06:35] <cizal11> passed right by those neurodes rip
[3:06:36] <applesonthemoon> its also explicitly not because of backseating, thats straight up wrong, hes doing it so we dont spoil him
[3:06:38] <faegbeard> DODGE THOSE NEURODES
[3:06:39] <Belutima> Pat Brain WORK HOW SMOrc
[3:06:40] <El_Samio> IGNORING TTHE NEURODES
[3:06:45] <+VariantX7> pats learning about the game...a little bit sideways. But learning is good
[3:06:47] <+QuadraticGravity> @PlagueOfGripes You rock for helping
[3:06:49] <Ashratcliffe1992> Hey everyone.
[3:06:50] <esr760> Neurodes REEEEEEE

[3:07:06] <+AntithesisEK> piece of the EXP pizza pie goes into the Focus refrigerator
[3:07:10] <+TeethMuncher> @PlagueOfGripes are you Pat's teacher dad now?
[3:07:11] <flying_man_3> war within does not do the same thing
[3:07:12] <+Cobra743> @PlagueOfGripes tell him to turn chat on pls
[3:07:14] <Zombrocom> Ehhh... not really
[3:07:16] <+gozzojt27> Eidolon lens or GTFO
[3:07:16] <flying_man_3> its like 10x lamer
[3:07:17] <@thenefftw> Nope, Stalker is just pissed
[3:07:20] <+skibbz_> not as much as second dream but it's pretty good
[3:07:23] <MC_GigglePants> Well we already know why Stalker is made after 2nd dream tho
[3:07:23] <drakthebest> uh, nope
[3:07:27] <PsychedelicSnake> Stalker is american kirby
[3:07:29] <GodlyLuigi> @PlagueOfGripes you mind telling pat about how his mastery rank lets level 0 weapons have some starting mod space, and that he should never not put in mods on new weapons right away
[3:07:29] <Zombrocom> It's a different sorta thing
[3:07:35] <+mozartdminor> stalker's gonna stalk
[3:07:36] <Croetec> Stalker is just "I'm 16 and I hate my father."
[3:07:37] <nyseoul85> plague's gonna have to turn his chat off soon lol
[3:07:43] <Shinmaddrox> Stalker is now forever War within Stalker.
[3:07:43] <+Ciphris> if no one spoiled things he'd look at chat
[3:07:44] <%Cityscape17> Now ya just gotta finish the storyline for your operator
[3:07:44] <+unfoldingchoas> @cobra743 he not looking at chat bxcause of spoilers
[3:07:45] <NoxinPistol> Stalker is not pissed, he's delirious.
[3:07:47] <%ssaryn> Stalker is basically just Murderface. Pissed off for not a good enough reason.
[3:08:01] <@thenefftw> I wouldn't
[3:08:10] <PsychedelicSnake> I wouldn't look it up
[3:08:13] <%Aldurin_> @PlagueOfGripes tell him to not look up this shit
[3:08:16] <cizal11> plague tell him not to look up anything
[3:08:20] <Xiangchang> Long may the Stream shine! \[T]/
[3:08:24] <%SandNoodle> not until doing war within anyway
[3:08:25] <+Phobaws06> use with enemies
[3:08:26] <+JellyT89> Y'all gotta remember that if you try to speed pat through all of this stuff it takes away the experience and fun
[3:08:26] <Zombrocom> Tell pat not to look it up until he does war within
[3:08:30] <+TeethMuncher> B-A-N-A-N-A-S
[3:08:30] <+MGKBurrito> CAREBEAR STARE
[3:08:32] <+ZiggyTank> stalker didn't want to rebel against the orokin and saw us as just murdering ppl

[3:08:53] <MC_GigglePants> Stalker is just an edgelord who found out he was actually a cryopod baby and not actually a cool space ninja so he threw a tantrum.
[3:08:55] <+migofrompluto> So, when the gold thing pops up is that just an extra bit of focus you can earn?
[3:08:56] <+QuadraticGravity> @Ashratcliffe1992 ye

[3:17:28] <@thenefftw> Waow
[3:17:29] <cizal11> lmao
[3:17:33] <+Castle_Kundarak> In time.
[3:17:33] <MC_GigglePants> Focus actually sucks
[3:17:34] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wollie dont like nice things
[3:17:36] <Goldteddy> not yet...
[3:17:39] <Cyphereous> @PlagueOfGripes Free energy garbage
[3:17:41] <laguerrilha> tutorial NOT over
[3:17:42] <@PlagueOfGripes> Pat will never have a bedroom.
[3:17:47] <cizal11> lmfao
[3:17:49] <faegbeard> BIG grind
[3:17:51] <+shaderichter_belmont> focus is meh if you aren't using it to fill your meters of buff melee
[3:17:52] <+MGKBurrito> now begins the real grind
[3:17:53] <CertainlySyrix> Some of Focus is insanely good
[3:17:54] <sunriser696> show wollie a purple green octavia
[3:17:56] <+QuadraticGravity> Someone get Pat more lenses, Greater ones.
[3:17:57] <tangoragahn> Or a toliet

[3:18:11] <Goldteddy> you thought monster hunter was grindy sometimes!?
[3:18:13] <+QuadraticGravity> @Zoh87 Nah, that's after WW
[3:18:15] <+crimsonharvest> how the fuck is this a free game
[3:18:16] <CertainlySyrix> @shaderichter_belmont you can zoom across PoE faster than any frame in the game if you get some stuff in Naramon, and you can upgrade their armor enough to be super fuckin tanky
[3:18:22] <applesonthemoon> pat may have focus lenses, but can he see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch?
[3:18:24] <Banjoboozle> Say goodnight Pat
[3:18:24] <Maverick2736> Focus system is currently the biggest bitch to farm in the game, even after DE considerably reduced the grind for it multiple times. It's still humongously grindy
[3:18:26] <deviljhojho94> This was the nice stream
[3:18:29] <KruelDestiny> Yeyeye
