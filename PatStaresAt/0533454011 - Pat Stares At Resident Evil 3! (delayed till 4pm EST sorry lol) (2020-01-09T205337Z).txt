[0:04:44] <SilverFaustX> oh earlie strem
[0:04:45] <DanThePumpkinman> so no multiple endings means no 'live choices' right? they decided the ending, among other stuff
[0:04:57] <+Cityscape17> hello everyone
[0:04:58] <scaryboisupreme> No Mercs mode either

[0:05:16] <ELJOVENBATALI> i mean re2make was good
[0:05:19] <$insaneintentionsyo> hope he goes for the Barry ending
[0:05:25] <ELJOVENBATALI> but not multiple endings is concerning
[0:05:27] <artoflec> yeah its a little disappointing, but im sure once you beat RE3 remake you'll unlock some fun modes and they might add mercs later.
[0:05:28] <+trekkie11041> that fine re2 didnt have zapping
[0:05:37] <+Menitta> What even were the different endings
[0:05:38] <%Quigsies> Are the endings that different?
[0:05:41] <scaryboisupreme> I miss the zapping system tho
[0:05:42] <+zanzibar_junker> I was too into Transformers toys to get into Pokemon.
[0:05:51] <+gizmo_go_boom> the endings aren't that different lol
[0:05:53] <scaryboisupreme> RE3 has a bunch of endings
[0:05:53] <ELJOVENBATALI> im sure r3make will have extra content, most resi games do
[0:05:59] <%dylanhack> dylanhack subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:06:00] <+gizmo_go_boom> theres literally 2

[0:06:05] <%DesertPenguin> HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE
[0:06:07] <ELJOVENBATALI> carlos
[0:06:09] <scaryboisupreme> they weren't that different true
[0:06:12] <warmnoid> Theycallmenerf Carlos
[0:06:13] <DanThePumpkinman> endings werent too different but the live choices were great. made for lots of replayability
[0:06:17] <scaryboisupreme> but it was mostly who lives and who dies
[0:06:18] <+trekkie11041> @Quigsies literallly its just if barry saves carlos and jill or they get to the chopper before nikolai
[0:06:25] <+Menitta> they had 3 endings right

I'm a big pokemon mark and I wanted to tell you that I agree with you, Gamefreak has been disappointing me since X and Y. Super hype for mystery dungeon tho, game looks like a pop up story book and I love it. yadda yadda stream baby emlo
[0:06:42] <+zanzibar_junker> the multiple epilogues actively contradicted each other though in RE3
[0:06:42] <+gizmo_go_boom> @Menitta unless dying counts as an ending, only 2
[0:06:42] <artoflec> @trekkie11041 oh..thats not really a big deal then lol
[0:06:43] <$insaneintentionsyo> the ending with nicholai surviving is canon
[0:06:50] <%SomeSageAdvice> SomeSageAdvice subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Thank you for recommending me to level SMN to cap in FFXIV, it has become my favorite DPS class so far but people seem puzzled when I resurrect them? Do SMN just not do that normally?

[0:07:04] <ELJOVENBATALI> city
[0:07:09] <%Quigsies> So basically it doesn’t “really” matter?
[0:07:13] <+trekkie11041> yeah multiple endings is not really a big deal
[0:07:25] <+gizmo_go_boom> @scaryboisupreme agree i like that part as long as they don't lead to overpowered weapons
[0:07:26] <%Aleate> Aleate subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! o, patback
[0:07:28] <scaryboisupreme> If they keep the live selection thing but keep one ending I'll be fine
[0:07:35] <DanThePumpkinman> I'm assuming no multiple endings is so they can clean up the canon of re
[0:07:38] <+sherndon226> I can't wait for RE3R. I played the original way more than 2. Can't even tell you why
[0:07:39] <+gizmo_go_boom> live selection already confirmed gone
[0:07:41] <%legendscar01> until 4?
[0:07:46] <+trekkie11041> theyll prob just add mercs later like they did with the r2 extra stuff

[0:08:10] <+Menitta> Re2make is becoming one of my favorite games now
[0:08:11] <%Kin_Corn_Karn> Fakk the Game Freak! I suplex them put them in the camel clutch and make them haamble
[0:08:12] <artoflec> the live selection pausing the game to bring up text options would be weird though, what if the city is just designed to have multiple paths.
[0:08:16] <%legendscar01> dude more resident evil the better
[0:08:18] <scaryboisupreme> Source on live selection being gone?
[0:08:20] <armandolorian> this is what I've been waiting for

[1:21:00] <alrobot2014> well some of the kids i knew in highschool were killed or died before or right after graduating
[1:21:00] <+sherndon226> I used to say stuff was gay and then a gay friend of mine said it was really offensive and upset them so I never did it again and took a hard look at my life. Apologised of course
[1:21:01] <%DesertPenguin> Fuckin' Cory...
[1:21:02] <+boezoe1> Probably to lenient upbringing
[1:21:03] <+SlumberMan> Some dude I went to high school with ended up going nuts and firing a gun in the street because a zombie apocalypse was happening.
[1:21:03] <Desertfishing> they don't punish them is why they are assholes
[1:21:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> IT'S THEIR FAULT
[1:21:05] <SunsetJack> They were too nice.
[1:21:06] <%Anime_Flux> Sometimes a kid is just a piece of crap

[2:56:14] <warmnoid> So this is the power of an ultimate bio weapon...
[2:56:14] <%the1truefaraldo> Maybe you're to deep in the corner
[2:56:17] <AlvinTheLiar> Do you think they'll add a bookcase you can block him with in the remake
[2:56:18] <rytisone> Books is his weakness
[2:56:18] <Dragovus> It's the bookcase teaming up with the black leather casting couch
[2:56:18] <%cdrom321> @kaisermario Of course he loves RE4. He's the originator of the creepy sex thing.
[2:56:19] <+PlagueOfGripes> too bad he looks like someone glued spaghetti to a burn victim

[2:57:34] <%ClaudeMcGarren> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Brancing off of woolies consenting cannibalism section of the chat theres a manga called Fire Punch that contains a brother and sister who have almost instant regenerative powers in the first 3 pages the brother in this duo uses it to have his arm cut off as many times as needed to feed those without food in his town, and yea he feels it every time boy is it fucked

[2:58:08] <arikk42> I THOUGHT IT WAS A CANNON
[2:58:19] <arikk42> LIKE BARACUDA
[2:58:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Fire Punch in general is fucked. Never finished it
[2:58:19] <%FirearmsInstructor> @BisoromiBear 9mm? In MY 1911? It's more likely than you think!
[2:58:20] <Huntercd> Jill and chris continue the redfield line
[2:58:20] <daisyyyy> scope on a 9mm seems a little much
[2:58:21] <%KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes They ran outta things to say about games
[2:58:25] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Who's cooler? Samus or Jill?
[2:58:28] <+fingalights> @PlagueOfGripes what ever do you mean
[2:58:30] <natebud> If pat thinks going from 1 to 2 felt bad, wait until he has to go from 3 to CVX
[2:58:32] <%jillvxlentine> except for jill and sherry getting their separate viruses, no
[2:58:34] <ClutchSuts> Were there ever any cat BOWs?
[2:58:42] <%Aydarkzero> free kills Pog
[2:58:42] <skinmansgds> The Eagle has a 1 in 10 chance of shooting a shot as strong as the Magnum
[2:58:43] <%RedSharkHC> @xerosigmaprime Jill is the GOAT
[2:58:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FREE MONEY?
[2:58:46] <rytisone> bomb the cafe
[2:58:47] <mishiryu> Pat are you as excited for REmake 3 as you were for REmake 2? Or is RE3 not as big a game for you in general?
[2:58:48] <%valriot> LUL
[2:58:49] <MSN04_Sazabi> I guess Browning Hi-power is kinda like a 9mm 1911
[2:58:49] <%DappercatEsquire> i anticipate you still dying to him

[3:01:20] <%DappercatEsquire> Pat, thank you for finally bringing the "would you eat human flesh" dilemma to a wider audience than the people I manage at work
[3:01:21] <%TheQButton> I don't remember running into this many "I chose death" journals last time I played this...
[3:01:23] <%FirearmsInstructor> @chaumiester RPGAyaya correct! Just wanted to make sure you were familiar with him. (And if not I would direct you there)
[3:01:25] <akumakaizokun> why soooo many blue herbs?

[3:01:48] <+Jokobeast> Play dead! [BANG]
[3:01:49] <tehmanicman_> Cannibalism always needed that mainstream break it rightfully deserved
[3:01:50] <%Caped_Eggy> Pup snuffer, Bork breaker
[3:01:51] <Novapulsus> @akumakaizokun Brain suckers
[3:01:52] <$Afterman_> this is the kind of city i want in re3make
[3:01:55] <mishiryu> This is honestly the coolest Jill ever looked
[3:01:56] <konami2010> that doggo had a plan
[3:01:57] <$Afterman_> you can tell how fucked it got in this game
[3:02:00] <%rufus2k2> HOO
[3:02:01] <%mayorrev> dog asplode
[3:02:07] <%rufus2k2> now that was a borkbuster round!
[3:02:08] <kegelsthecorgi> @DappercatEsquire Are the people you manage concerned?
[3:02:12] <%Aydarkzero> randomly?
[3:02:13] <%Validuntil2077> crit chance?
[3:02:13] <%FirearmsInstructor> Increased crit %
[3:02:16] <Soulbishop> Made it to stream
[3:02:17] <mishiryu> IT MAKES A BETTER BANG BANG SOUND
[3:02:19] <+officialprisonmike> random crit
[3:02:19] <%Jekado> here me out guys cannibalism muk bang
[3:02:22] <+fingalights> FAST, BETTER, STRONGER,
[3:02:22] <%Aydarkzero> WHAT
[3:02:22] <skinmansgds> 1 in 10 chance
[3:02:24] <+chaumiester> @FirearmsInstructor I know of him. Watched some of his stuff here and there. ATM, I'm rebuilding my collection. I'm so excited that Colt is actually Re-releasing the Colt Python again
[3:02:25] <%Sartastic> pop pop
[3:02:25] <ospreyworks> There's just something about RE2's and RE3's soundtracks.
[3:02:28] <KolvinSanctus> How long has he been playing already?
[3:02:30] <%Falilth> so was racoon city in the middle of a desert or something , how did that truck driver get bit way outside and no where else get infected?
[3:02:30] <%Aydarkzero> does it have a sound que?
[3:02:30] <Silverkry2> It cant use the high end handgun ammo though
[3:02:31] <+PlagueOfGripes> something satisfying about using a magnum to make a zombie dog tumble around like a paper bag in the wind
[3:02:38] <Ranger747> I love her design in this. The waist jacket is a cool touch
[3:02:42] <akumakaizokun> does it do more damage?
[3:02:43] <%Cykron> Doggos, meet Mr. Luger
[3:02:46] <faronmcsalty> one thing i really love about re3 is the slogging it in the streets
[3:02:49] <natebud> This is the only game where the handgun is good until the end. Sometimes you can one shot multiple hunters if they stand in a row.
[3:02:52] <ClutchSuts> Whoops, dropped a monster shot from my magnum gun
[3:02:55] <%FacetiousAF> pupper snufferrrrsss
[3:02:56] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Ok, for real, I think cannibalism gets a bad rap as something barbaric and terrible, but animals eat each other and eat people, and we eat animals, and we just call that nature.
[3:02:56] <%DappercatEsquire> @kegelsthecorgi No but now it has built into a mythology that I only eat "long pig" because I never eat at work.
[3:02:57] <Aydarkzero> that's Kendo for ya
[3:02:58] <%Sartastic> what a hero
[3:02:58] <natebud> It does do more damage
[3:03:00] <%FirearmsInstructor> @chaumiester As am I. I'm sure collectors are mixed, but damn am I happy to pick one (or more) up this year!
[3:03:00] <%jillvxlentine> isnt it a blazer?
[3:03:08] <grayjammer> Snuff Snuff goes the Gun
[3:03:14] <%Validuntil2077> actually exploring a lot of raccoon city is awesome
[3:03:19] <%TheQButton> I can't believe you Ol'yellered all those puppos bro.
[3:03:25] <%FirearmsInstructor> @chaumiester you know JM? His youtube channel?
[3:03:27] <+PlagueOfGripes> RE3 has no chill
[3:03:30] <GreyFoxHoundDD> I would eat ethically sourced people
[3:03:30] <rytisone> Who's Tony?
[3:03:30] <bluefooddye1> !uptime
[3:03:31] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 3m.
[3:03:32] <Soulbishop> He’d died but made it to stream and welcome you back
[3:03:33] <mishiryu> Honestly if they HAD to "update" Jill's outfit for the REmake, could they not have at least included the white sweater around her waist???
[3:03:35] <+chaumiester> @FirearmsInstructor Yeah, I'm glad I can finally actually grab one. It may not be as good as the original. But at least I can have one
[3:03:39] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Some people swallow too! Thats also a form of cannibalism!
[3:03:43] <skinmansgds> This game has a ludicrous surplus of ammo
[3:03:44] <+chaumiester> @FirearmsInstructor Which JM?
[3:03:45] <natebud> I like the note you find from Kendo talking about how perfect Jill's handgun is, then you instantly find a better handgun.
[3:03:47] <majima666> yeah, exploring the city in the remake is going to be fucking awesome
[3:03:55] <+Dingalow> Imagine if Pat died now and had to fight Nemesis again, that'd be so funny
[3:04:01] <BadgerDK> is it just me or is the music distorted?
[3:04:08] <$insaneintentionsyo> are ya winnin, son?
[3:04:13] <%peachy996> Twitch
[3:04:19] <+Loyks> it flickers sometimes
[3:04:20] <$Ziegsy> @BadgerDK Ive been hearing that ALOT on twitch
[3:04:21] <+GameOver_Here> With all the different guns you can tell they were heading more toward action.
[3:04:27] <Stillchr> infinite ammo bag
[3:04:31] <SuperFineButtHairs> youre incredible pat
[3:04:32] <bluefooddye1> Especially against living things
[3:04:32] <%peachy996> Twitch streams tend to distort music
[3:04:35] <warmnoid> 3 fucking doggos
[3:04:38] <joylent_blue> if you refresh then that twitch bug should fix itself
[3:04:39] <SuperFineButtHairs> <3
[3:04:39] <%Validuntil2077> unpopular opinion but handguns are way cooler
[3:04:41] <tehmanicman_> No mercy on them doggos
[3:04:43] <%peachy996> I hear it all the time in MK strams
[3:04:43] <+gralho> geez
[3:04:44] <OmniSTylez> i hear the distorted music a lot during OW streams too
[3:04:46] <DavidSanChan> re3 remake should have jill wearing a destroyable sweater so we can have no sweater damage runs
[3:04:48] <%Cykron> @firearmsinstructor Could you recommend a good .45 for carry? I have a Springfield 1911 that’s a bit too unwieldy for daily use
[3:04:48] <clown_shoes> three zomborks
[3:04:50] <akumakaizokun> you're killing it Pat FrankerZ
[3:04:50] <tehmanicman_> Is this the equivalent of punching down?
[3:04:51] <SuperFineButtHairs> rip doggo
[3:04:52] <%DappercatEsquire> LOOK AT THIS
[3:04:53] <%spiritofmojave> Poor pasta dogs
[3:04:53] <+Dingalow> That was fucking insane
[3:04:55] <nehaerys> there's literally no reason to kill these dogs
[3:04:56] <%dukenux> Borks Busted
[3:04:57] <$insaneintentionsyo> bawkCop bawkGun FrankerZ
[3:04:57] <%MaddyCaddy> apatJpeg
[3:04:59] <devanmuse> @Ziegsy You too? I thought it was an issue on my end -- like my wifi signal strength was bad and fussing with the audio quality or something
[3:04:59] <Ranger747> handguns in games are sweet
[3:05:00] <SuperFineButtHairs> DO YOU SEE?
[3:05:02] <mishiryu> The only thing about the STI Eagle is that Jill is more likely to take a knee if she dodges while firing it
[3:05:05] <$Afterman_> pat had to take his anger out on those dogs
[3:05:05] <majima666> ive heard people talk about it but the sound bugs never happened to me
[3:05:06] <%TheQButton> Good job sword!
[3:05:13] <+chaumiester> @Validuntil2077 No... that's just True. Pistols are cooler. But rifles/shotguns are more effective.... IRL
[3:05:14] <%FirearmsInstructor> @chaumiester Jerry Miculek. Check out his latest YT vid released 6 days ago. They just released the Mossberg 940 JM Pro. Giving one away as a promo. (Will be announced at shot show). Just have to like the vid and drop a comment to be entered to win it.
[3:05:23] <%Agami23> pat, why would you kill thedogs? zombies i get, but dogs??
[3:05:23] <%mayorrev> LICC
[3:05:24] <CollinsOfBodom> Jill "Michael Vick" Valentine
[3:05:26] <SuperFineButtHairs> WutFace WutFace
[3:05:34] <+GameOver_Here> Chimeras this early?
[3:05:36] <%peachy996> No not LICC
[3:05:37] <%mayorrev> are those crabs?
[3:05:38] <%MisterTylerrr> SUCC
[3:05:39] <%rufus2k2> PSYCH
[3:05:39] <%peachy996> SUCC
[3:05:41] <vaderxyz1970> I'm more amazed it holds 15 rounds
[3:05:41] <+AcrutaLao> Om nom nom
[3:05:42] <+PlagueOfGripes> it's a meatball!
[3:05:42] <%rufus2k2> OUTSKILLED
[3:05:42] <majima666> those arent chimeras
[3:05:43] <$Ziegsy> @devanmuse I thought it was my headphones dying for a while. But yeah, Ive been hearing it on other channels too. Just like a pitch shift down
[3:05:47] <%peachy996> These are Brainsuckers
[3:05:49] <%jillvxlentine> NOT THE SUCC
[3:05:49] <skinmansgds> These guys are Brainsuckers I think
[3:05:49] <SuperFineButtHairs> just a couple smoochies
[3:05:49] <konami2010> TABLE HOPPER
[3:05:50] <%mayorrev> whatre those?
[3:05:50] <BadgerDK> yeah the sound is rising and dropping in pitch on my end and it's awful
[3:05:50] <majima666> brain suckers or brain demos
[3:05:53] <majima666> i get mixed up
[3:05:54] <+chaumiester> @FirearmsInstructor Oh, him. Yeah, I just watched his video. The new shotgun is cool, but I'm not too much of a shotgun guy honestly. More of a pistol/rifle guy
[3:05:56] <KolvinSanctus> Those look really disgusting
[3:05:58] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Cykron You 100% hardset on .45? (Not questioning the choice, just want to ensure that's what you'd like to stick with.)
[3:05:58] <koolkatdq> what the fuck is that thing
[3:05:59] <$Ziegsy> Thats what happens when someone with crabs gets bitten by a zom
[3:05:59] <SuperFineButtHairs> this music tho
[3:05:59] <Novapulsus> @majima666 Drain Deimos
[3:06:00] <oniwahoo> Isn't that the thing in RE5?
[3:06:00] <ClutchSuts> Too few limbs on this fella
[3:06:02] <%eiightbiitt> what's that enemy called?
[3:06:06] <joylent_blue> BadgerDK refresh, that should fix it
[3:06:07] <natebud> Brainsucker?
[3:06:08] <skinmansgds> Drain Demos come later
[3:06:11] <mishiryu> aparently brain suckers don't react if you walk, just like lickers
[3:06:12] <$insaneintentionsyo> can't wait to see these guys
[3:06:14] <Huntercd> Fuck Chimeras
[3:06:17] <%peachy996> The RE5 Bugs are Reapers
[3:06:18] <$Afterman_> chimera re1
[3:06:19] <$Chimeraelite> oi
[3:06:20] <$insaneintentionsyo> brain suckers
[3:06:22] <%MaddyCaddy> Why does this city have so much gunpowder lying around?
[3:06:27] <DirgeNovak> wait RE3 had a dodge button?!
[3:06:27] <kurejichi> You guys know these Chimera creatures can lay eggs that hatch babies? it's SUPER rare
[3:06:28] <%Cykron> @firearmsinstructor yeah it’s just personal preference. I enjoy shooting .45 the most
[3:06:29] <%Validuntil2077> but not as cool as either of them
[3:06:32] <SuperFineButtHairs> youre a tick pat
[3:06:32] <konami2010> chimickers
[3:06:33] <%jillvxlentine> icky
[3:06:33] <%OldOnyx> fleas
[3:06:34] <%TheQButton> Hope those fuckers don't make it to the remake!
[3:06:37] <oniwahoo> @peachy996 Thanks
[3:06:37] <+RenoDeGeneric> Just makes me think of Reapers
[3:06:38] <%bluebiscuit94> !uptime

[3:30:23] <+fingalights> Where they shot out of cannon? what was that sound
[3:30:24] <%jillvxlentine> slightly more threatening than the save room music were used to
[3:30:33] <majima666> what was with the sound effect lmao
[3:30:36] <SuperFineButtHairs> THE ZAPPING SYSTEM
[3:30:37] <%Taisuru> Pat would you play a classic RE style game with procedurally generated levels?

[3:31:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> SOUL REAVER WHEN
[3:31:04] <%Shadicara> Good point actually why didn't RE2 Remake have a randomizer
[3:31:06] <konami2010> i can't believe you've done this
[3:31:07] <%DappercatEsquire> Everything is eventually remade in the eternal recurrence
[3:31:08] <sanguineskull> Literally the worst way to open a shutter ever.
[3:31:08] <%Jekado> @KabaBoBaba techincally the series ended
[3:31:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> PLAY SOUL REAVER PAT
[3:31:12] <%D3rrtyD4n> soul reaver aged poorly

[3:31:19] <majima666> i have family in belgium that live by a city called mons. that sign cant be a reference to it can it

[3:31:28] <%mayorrev> uuuuuuuuuuhhuhuhhhh
[3:31:29] <%XeroSigmaPrime> What would you think of an RE movie.. thats actually faithful? Something like an Outbreak game story?
[3:31:29] <majima666> i mean that would be fucked up
[3:31:33] <+fingalights> Restless
[3:31:34] <+Dingalow> I believe the N64 version of RE2 had a randomiser mode
[3:31:35] <+theotherkristian> @sphincter_spelunker CDX looks like the most jank

[3:35:10] <%augusm> augusm subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! oh no the pp is burning
[3:35:17] <+officialprisonmike> carlos was just a figment of jill's imagination this whole time.
[3:35:22] <%FirearmsInstructor> @natebud ?
[3:35:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @majima666 Raccoon City was based on Montreal
[3:35:23] <%king_wragles> @natebud no but I hear burning feathers
[3:35:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I think
[3:35:37] <%Shadicara> How real will it be in the remake tho
[3:35:39] <%TheQButton> @dukenux I think he is in like a book or something... XD IDK
[3:35:46] <konami2010> Montreal is not a real place
[3:35:47] <skinmansgds> This city was clearly modeled on whatever was outside Capcom HQ
[3:35:51] <%JJCheeker> It is a real place in our imagination
[3:35:52] <%FirearmsInstructor> @king_wragles They kinda smell like purple
[3:35:56] <%walternatorz> raccoon city is real in our hearts
[3:36:03] <lloyddboy> japanies
[3:36:12] <FalseEyeD> Jamerica
[3:36:14] <%crimsonharvest> yeah this time its japanies
[3:36:15] <SuperFineButtHairs> japanies
[3:36:18] <%Shadicara> Jamerica
[3:36:19] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Remake 2 already has inconsistencies with Remake 3's map released in promo material
[3:36:19] <%KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Is Carlos one of the worst or one of the best characters in RE?
[3:36:23] <+theotherkristian> Hey, how many copies did RE3 sell?
[3:36:24] <trianglehat> are japanese streets full of absurd item puzzles?
[3:36:24] <konami2010> best
[3:36:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> It's a city in Japanies, you right
[3:36:25] <%peachy996> With RE3make Sheva has inherited "remember this sidekick?" from Carlos
[3:36:27] <%Pappajimbo> japmerica
[3:36:32] <$insaneintentionsyo> would you sandwich Jill? bawkGasm
[3:36:32] <mishiryu> I bet REmake 3 WONT have Japanese streets and that makes me SAD.
[3:36:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah looks very Yakuzieish minus the goth statues
[3:36:36] <%JJCheeker> Raccoon city is pretty trashy
[3:36:39] <$Tuskor13> working together, solvin the problem
[3:36:40] <+ExpressNode> Man my internet is fucky today. Weather is horrible
[3:36:40] <natebud> @FirearmsInstructor there's a myth about smelling burnt toast when you have brain damage
[3:36:42] <akumakaizokun> coz American streets are fuckin HUGE
[3:36:44] <%3rdwarrior> Kojima's america
[3:36:45] <SuperFineButtHairs> youre a dumb asspat
[3:36:56] <RiverBirch> Would Raccoon City techniqly be counted as an Escape Room if it didn't have all the zombies in it?
[3:36:59] <+PlagueOfGripes> did that say Cafe: T.N.A.
[3:37:03] <%Keyd00d> fightfuck
[3:37:04] <natebud> Sometimes its dogs
[3:37:07] <mishiryu> Whats an "asspat"?
[3:37:07] <SuperFineButtHairs> BIRDO
[3:37:07] <%StaceMcGate> BIRB
[3:37:08] <%Valdorick> BURB
[3:37:09] <%Keyd00d> apatCaw
[3:37:09] <%AudioSpiral> BIRDEMIC
[3:37:10] <+KabaBoBaba> dogs with wings
[3:37:11] <%FirearmsInstructor> @natebud ah. I *THOUGHT* I'd heard that before, but I didn't know what it was in reference to. I was thinking a stroke or something.
[3:37:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BIRD UP
[3:37:14] <%jillvxlentine> isnt it when you have a stroke
[3:37:15] <+denmonari> BORGS

[3:37:17] <%FirearmsInstructor> @natebud Thank you
[3:37:18] <$insaneintentionsyo> bawkGlad
[3:37:19] <%xmaspresent7000> t
[3:37:19] <derap41> BTW why are the birds even they ever explain that?
[3:37:19] <skinmansgds> BIRD UP
[3:37:23] <SuperFineButtHairs> nemesis is taking a nap
[3:37:24] <+PlagueOfGripes> he got tired ok
[3:37:24] <konami2010> bloodborne dogbirds
[3:37:26] <tank7013> @peachy996 I bet she'll come back before Parker
[3:37:27] <%JJCheeker> Hey it's the part where you find a random car battery
[3:37:28] <faronmcsalty> nemesis had to go off the clock for lunch
[3:37:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> BEEES
[3:37:30] <%xmaspresent7000> my balls hurt
[3:37:30] <%michingmallecho> Ya boo bay
[3:37:32] <FalseEyeD> Camera is out of sync
[3:37:32] <%StaceMcGate> Not much of a Nemesis then is he?
[3:37:36] <%JJCheeker> Who puts a car battery in the statue
[3:37:38] <%peachy996> @tank7013 who
[3:37:38] <FalseEyeD> Camera is way out of sync
[3:37:40] <majima666> the nemesis depression arc
[3:37:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Wouldn't birds be worse with the viruses? Ala MGS V?
[3:37:44] <$Tuskor13> is this the RE game with the loading door jumpscare
[3:37:45] <Kalcom> why is a battery in there
[3:37:46] <%Keyd00d> we all get tired
[3:37:48] <%peachy996> Or what about Ashley
[3:37:50] <%KaiserMario> WHY WOULD SOMEONE HIDE A BATTERY IN A STATUE???
[3:37:51] <Kalcom> who made this
[3:37:58] <tank7013> @peachy996 Exactly. The male sidekick from Rev 1
[3:37:59] <+KabaBoBaba> why not?
[3:37:59] <majima666> "is STARRRS really worth it?"
[3:38:04] <trianglehat> to keep the battery safe obviously
[3:38:04] <%Validuntil2077> he gets his ass kicked for a while
[3:38:05] <ospreyworks> @Tuskor13 I think that's RE2
[3:38:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> HOW CAN THIS BATTERY FIR IN THE CABLE CAR
[3:38:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hoarders
[3:38:08] <%xcompleasedad> @Kalcom Capcom
[3:38:08] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I thought the whole selling point of the game was Nemesis is always chasing you 90%of the time
[3:38:09] <%SoFarFetched> Because Raccoon city loves puzzles
[3:38:11] <%jillvxlentine> parker!
[3:38:12] <shoobieredgrave> Because the statue moves?
[3:38:14] <rytisone> video games
[3:38:14] <akumakaizokun> he loses his sense of direction without his trenchcoat
[3:38:15] <%JJCheeker> It doesn't make sense
[3:38:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> RE IS SO STUPID I LOVE IT
[3:38:17] <Kalcom> I mean in canon!
[3:38:19] <%D3rrtyD4n> atpShh
[3:38:19] <%3rdwarrior> like I would would get crazy claustrophobic with those tight streets and tall buildings
[3:38:20] <+ElarusTheMage> BAT TER REE
[3:38:23] <mishiryu> Jill is 23 in this game but sounds about 45.
[3:38:24] <%peachy996> @tank7013 wow I thought that was a Jill only game
[3:38:25] <+Demerson13> BA TER RY
[3:38:32] <+DeaconBluesClues> @angriestpat yeah anyways, ever read Vincent Merkin's old gameFAQs guides on how-to speedrun and do knife only guides? he had a shitload of speedrun records in the day, and was the dude who invented (to my knowledge) no-merchant runs in RE4. he's also how I know RE3 has semi randomized enemies and that Nemesis is left handed.
[3:38:32] <%StaceMcGate> Umbrella's founder had a simple dream; a world of puzzles
[3:38:33] <%Jekado> did the same person who made the mansion and the police department designed the city also
[3:38:35] <natebud> It's an electric statue, how you think it moves?
[3:38:38] <%KaiserMario> Was the whole city designed by that Spencer mansion guy?
[3:38:40] <%TheQButton> @dukenux oh no he is in Umbrella Chronicles I remember now.
[3:38:44] <+DarthFreeman> Is it ever explained why Capcom settled on Typewriters for saving?
[3:38:54] <kurejichi> @AngriestPat Director of the game said it's because the mayor is so proud of his involvement in technological developments or something
[3:39:04] <majima666> oddly enough in re1.5 they were planning on having you save with computers
[3:39:06] <%DappercatEsquire> RE series is just a prequel to Professor Layton
[3:39:09] <SuperFineButtHairs> WutFace WutFace WutFace
[3:39:09] <%JJCheeker> I hate those things
[3:39:11] <Kalcom> just do it perfect
[3:39:12] <tank7013> @peachy996 Nope. She's got Parker as a sidekick and you play as Chris with some other lady for a mission or two
[3:39:14] <mishiryu> Ye olde mansion aesthetic probably was the reason for typewriters
[3:39:14] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Always do high power shutter at the substation first.
[3:39:15] <majima666> but i dont think it was ever explained
[3:39:15] <SuperFineButtHairs> those are gross
[3:39:18] <+PlagueOfGripes> they will suck
[3:39:21] <LocalRobyn> ah yes, brain suckers, of course
[3:39:26] <%walternatorz> stamos? nick stamos?
[3:39:29] <%AudioSpiral> The suck is inevitable
[3:39:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SUC LC
[3:39:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> t virus evolution?
[3:39:34] <ShichiNoBushi> And solving the puzzle just turns the statue around revealing the hole with the battery in it. There was probably some other mechanism that open a door or something, but it seems you could have just taken the battery out without solving the puzzle.
[3:39:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Good ol' man bulldog Parker
[3:39:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE SUCC
[3:39:38] <akumakaizokun> ones green ones not
[3:39:42] <%Jekado> i'm thinking john stamos
[3:39:44] <sanguineskull> You're talking about Jessica
[3:39:58] <%Wool> Wool subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! I was teaching my students about Quebec separatism awhile back and one of the kids said he knew a lot about Canada from listening to a podcast by Canadian videogamers. I almost fucking panicked but he was talking about some other channel.
[3:39:58] <%Jekado> or rebecca romaine stamos
[3:40:02] <%jillvxlentine> parker + jill, chris + jessica
[3:40:03] <%StaceMcGate> Dosh, grab it while you can lads
[3:40:04] <Huntercd> That zombie butt tho
[3:40:05] <sanguineskull> Chris & Jill, and Jessica and Parker.
[3:40:09] <%jillvxlentine> then they swap partners
[3:40:09] <%Shadicara> There's a twitcher
[3:40:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Wool LUL
[3:40:13] <%crimsonharvest> thats great wool
[3:40:14] <sanguineskull> Or whatever
[3:40:16] <ForgetfulUthanasiast> Are you always that fast with menus?
[3:40:18] <%Caped_Eggy> That's claire
[3:40:21] <%Ion_Laser> @Wool :D
[3:40:22] <SuperFineButtHairs> claire nooo
[3:40:22] <$insaneintentionsyo> orchHands
[3:40:23] <%SoFarFetched> that lady is almost dresed like cliare
[3:40:23] <SuperFineButtHairs> :(
[3:40:25] <+PlagueOfGripes> fuck you karen zombie
[3:40:25] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Caped_Eggy PogChamp
[3:40:26] <mishiryu> Know what i dont get? Why Capcom would EVER make Jill's hair longer than her RE3 hair in later games, the FOOLS
[3:40:27] <+fingalights> Is she saying no?
[3:40:31] <%Jekado> probably memory muscle
[3:40:43] <$Afterman_> pon de replay
[3:40:45] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat what's the best menu in gaming history?
[3:40:45] <%JJCheeker> Nobody likes Karen
[3:40:55] <%Caped_Eggy> @FirearmsInstructor WutFace
[3:41:05] <Grunkle_Dan_> i just finished rewatching the SBFP playthrough of this the other day. Great to see you playing it again!
[3:41:08] <ForgetfulUthanasiast> Even new menus?? 😱
[3:41:09] <%JJCheeker> All the other zombies talk about it behind her back
[3:41:09] <ospreyworks> Can Capcom just redo 5 and 6? Not talking remake. Just write over them like they never happened.
[3:41:12] <ShichiNoBushi> Could you play RE2 blindfolded?
[3:41:12] <skinmansgds> So the Grenade Launcher is behind one of these dooes
[3:41:14] <%SoFarFetched> @mishiryu you do long hair to let people know TIME has passed
[3:41:18] <akumakaizokun> Re8 HAD BETTER HAVE MENU MANAGEMENT
[3:41:20] <+gralho> why
[3:41:22] <$rytyoung> WHEN WE TOUCH
[3:41:25] <%jillvxlentine> ive watched the lp of this like 10+ times
[3:41:31] <majima666> danger danger, high voltage. when we touch, when we kiss
[3:41:32] <%FirearmsInstructor> @gralho gun :)
[3:41:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> quick maffs
[3:41:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @ospreyworks 5 is cheesy coop goodness tho
[3:41:55] <FaderPotater> is the afternoon streaming a recent thing? I feel like a few months ago he started in the evening
[3:41:57] <%StaceMcGate> Can capcom redo Chris Redfields design from RE7? I'd gladly take roid gorilla Chris back
[3:41:59] <%TheQButton> nailed it
[3:42:03] <ospreyworks> "3.6 not great, not terrible."
[3:42:06] <King_thunder365> OH NO, NOT HIGH VOLTAGE! They're gonna ruin the ZOE HD Collection and be a factor in ZOE 3's cancellation!
[3:42:06] <sanguineskull> I'd hate to have a job in Raccoon City. Everything would be a damn puzzle.
[3:42:08] <derap41> its not the voltage its the amper that kills. even though that's a myth
[3:42:11] <trianglehat> big brain
[3:42:13] <%jillvxlentine> himbo chris is the only chris
[3:42:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @FaderPotater earlier streams are attempts to fix sleep schedule
[3:42:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @faderpotater he startd earlier when he doesn't sleep well
[3:42:25] <SocialMisfitGamer> what the fuck kind of math was that
[3:42:31] <mishiryu> apatLiz
[3:42:34] <%Jekado> i hope in RE3remake nemesis just pops out of a random item box and shoryukens your ass.
[3:42:41] <%StaceMcGate> So much brown!
[3:42:41] <MrDonTacos_> monkaS
[3:42:42] <+CopyWritedDad> woah pat got this game early?? waynerSlurp

[3:42:48] <akumakaizokun> best launcher in series
[3:42:50] <majima666> its the lads
[3:42:51] <ospreyworks> @BallerSwagBro9k But but but. Jill in that dumb catsuit and global saturation.
[3:42:58] <mishiryu> Not enough (clearly)
[3:42:59] <%TheQButton> Like a bug zapper damn.
[3:43:02] <Man_in_the_Red> @jekado he pops up in the playstation menu to attack
[3:43:04] <tank7013> Eat shit nerds

[3:43:29] <%ArAechFGC> @AngriestPat Iceborne on PC today. are you gonna stare at that?
[3:43:31] <%Valdorick> @FirearmsInstructor fuck
[3:43:31] <CrimsonFox777> SPOILERS D:
[3:43:31] <derap41> 2 was way to childish
[3:43:34] <%scaryboisupreme> Pat you picked the wrong live event
[3:43:39] <Grunkle_Dan_> you said that in the LP too, I love the trivia :D
[3:43:39] <%StaceMcGate> Do Return of the Living Dead zombies never die no matter what you do?
[3:43:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @ospreyworks Tru Jill was an abomination. But saturation was meme gold
[3:43:45] <%scaryboisupreme> you have to pick the other one to get the Nemesis thing
[3:43:48] <ForgetfulUthanasiast> I have heard of that movie series somewhere
[3:43:49] <akumakaizokun> Day of the dead was SUPER brutal and gory
[3:43:49] <natebud> No one knows
[3:43:50] <derap41> not punk enough eitehr
[3:43:54] <%JJCheeker> Oops
[3:43:55] <snootyhooty> I just fight him like a member of stars
[3:43:56] <%jillvxlentine> i think you have to pick the other event for nem
[3:44:00] <ospreyworks> @BallerSwagBro9k Considering that all the remade games have gone for a much darker, grounded tone, 5 and 6 just flop up against that aesthetic like dead fish.
[3:44:02] <rytisone> do it legit
[3:44:04] <shoobieredgrave> chat full of zoomers that never played this
[3:44:04] <+Seitine> lionNice
[3:44:06] <sanguineskull> JUST DO IT, PAT.
[3:44:07] <mishiryu> I wonder if Jill's leg tap will be in REmake 3
[3:44:08] <sanguineskull> DO THE THING.
[3:44:18] <%scaryboisupreme> You gotta go out of the emergency exit to get the nemesis on the rooftop scene
[3:44:24] <derap41> Also Return of the living dead leaves no fucking room for a sequel the world is fucked after that ending
[3:44:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Excuse you, I'm a economy ruining Millennial
[3:44:29] <Ranger747> fucking Tarman
[3:44:30] <%JJCheeker> yeah we sure
[3:44:33] <+CopyWritedDad> i wish every time i opened a door IRL it played an animation of me opening the door
[3:44:45] <%ArAechFGC> why does this look so smooth? is it modded
[3:44:50] <%ClaudeMcGarren> you opening it is the animation @CopyWritedDad
[3:44:51] <%JJCheeker> yes
[3:44:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yes
[3:44:52] <Kalcom> ok now do it again

[3:44:58] <mishiryu> wow almost as big a threat as spiders
[3:45:01] <ForgetfulUthanasiast> I enjoy ruining the odd economy every now and then
[3:45:06] <%QueequegTheater> Alright so in retrospect I think I just write things in a weird stream-of-consciousness way that made that donation message extra distressing @AngriestPat
[3:45:14] <%ArAechFGC> it looks really good. is this that machine learning thing i hear about
[3:45:20] <%ClaudeMcGarren> yea
[3:45:21] <%Ion_Laser> @ArAechFGC yes
[3:45:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yes

[3:56:54] <Prevot> thot jill is best jill
[3:56:54] <rytisone> dye her hair blond
[3:56:56] <%Caped_Eggy> Wait who was that?
[3:56:58] <+hawk_rush> I thought this was the remake for a second LUL
[3:57:03] <+Cyoctane> Pat should have cosplayed Jill for this stream
[3:57:05] <%FirearmsInstructor> That pop is so satisfying
[3:57:08] <%D3rrtyD4n> she sounds fine
[3:57:09] <+hawk_rush> I was like "How the hell did Pat get the remake already???"
[3:57:09] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @Zaphire_Saucypants the shits never leave you LUL
[3:57:10] <%jcflyguy> Ah she fine
[3:57:11] <%dukenux> Tubetop Jill, STARS outfit Jill > rest
[3:57:16] <majima666> dont worry about it
[3:57:16] <%peachy996> Blonde Catsuit Jill is just bootleg Nina Williams
[3:57:19] <FalseEyeD> BibleThump Dario's Daughter?
[3:57:22] <oniwahoo> Pat cosplays as RE2 Sherry Birkin when?
[3:57:22] <%jcflyguy> See? Totally fine.
[3:57:23] <+CloniiCory> RE5 Jill is an abomination tbh. And probably the reason we'll never see her in another game.
[3:57:23] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Any chance of you getting an early copy of R3make for streaming
[3:57:24] <MrDonTacos_> BibleThump

[4:00:31] <%InugamiTheHound> what kind of pistol is Jill using? Because Claire used Hi-power and Leon used the Heckler & Koch VP70 in RE2.
[4:00:33] <rytisone> Nemesis gone for a lunch break
[4:00:38] <%dukenux> So can you update PC version of RE3 with those texture packs?

[4:03:05] <%Ion_Laser> @dukenux So I just checked and this HD pack only works with the Dolphin version of RE3
[4:03:07] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> honestly, I wouldn't mind if ever RE game were remade with the new engine.
[4:03:11] <ospreyworks> Yeah, I swear I saw it in someone else's LP before.

[4:07:08] <+CloniiCory> I think about Nemesis sometimes, why is it they didn't stick to him saying Stars like that? In other appearences he says it like a generic Hulk monster.
[4:07:12] <%Aydarkzero> @GameOver_Here if i had to guess it would prob be switched over if you went to classic ost
[4:07:14] <Ranger747> does this have adaptable difficulty?

[4:08:24] <%walternatorz> nemesis is stuck on a corner somewhere
[4:08:27] <%D3rrtyD4n> moon2SHRUG
[4:08:28] <majima666> he's having a smoke break

[4:08:42] <%jillvxlentine> he went home for dinner
[4:08:43] <+Jokobeast> He heard the freeze rounds were being busted out and noped outta here.
[4:08:44] <%Taisuru> Scared him off
[4:08:44] <%honeyman18> He went back to his home planet
[4:08:47] <%DappercatEsquire> Just like PT, Nemsis is always behind you
[4:08:49] <FutaSnek> He said fuck this dumb shit LUL
[4:08:50] <rytisone> He didn't like being ignored
[4:08:51] <%Jekado> HEY Nemesis what are old Russian leaders called? ZARRRS
[4:08:54] <%Taisuru> RELOAD
[4:08:56] <EvanAlmighty210> I just beat the RE2 remake the other day. It was my first RE game and I had a blast!
[4:08:56] <%Aydarkzero> somehow saying "Where's nemesis" is a horrifying concept
[4:08:57] <singleflamingo> now this is where the game actually begins
[4:08:57] <clown_shoes> you were taking too long, he got tired
[4:09:01] <trianglehat> but stars :(
[4:09:02] <Higaraishi> crazy talk activated so hard it straight up deleted nemesis from the game
[4:09:02] <%Jekado> maybe he despawned?
[4:09:03] <%walternatorz> he's busy, don't interupt him
[4:09:03] <%dukenux> Nemesis doesn't like cold cause they gave him a shitty coat with holes
[4:09:04] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> he said fuck dis bitch, I'm out.
[4:09:04] <%Frostydough1> @AngriestPat Nemesis said to leave your grenade laucnher at home and he will come out
[4:09:06] <%D3rrtyD4n> oh
[4:09:06] <jaid251> He saw them freeze rounds and ran
[4:09:09] <%OldOnyx> nemy has a slightly easier time dodging them because of the projectile speed but they're still the best against him overall
[4:09:09] <+RowenCleric> i think he pops randomly this whole area
[4:09:09] <%Taisuru> stars
[4:09:09] <trianglehat> STARS
[4:09:10] <skinmansgds> Just keep goin, he'll show up

[4:10:46] <Artugoesblank> you totally deserve that Pat.
[4:10:47] <%D3rrtyD4n> AUGH
[4:10:47] <+liquidzr0> GG NO RE
[4:10:51] <%dukenux> Hey Nemesis, looks like you could use some STAAAAAAAAIRS
[4:10:52] <%theodolitejones> Oh dang. At least leave him some digninty
[4:10:53] <+AXL808> uuhhwaaahh
[4:10:58] <+Katalist_> mmmm.. stars
[4:11:01] <%FirearmsInstructor> Nemesis has reported @AngriestPat
[4:11:02] <%Jekado> i guess you can say Jill gave him the "COLD SHOULDER"
[4:11:02] <%NopeBadguy> it turns out being geared means things are easier
[4:11:03] <+PlagueOfGripes> good old military issue ice beams
[4:11:11] <skinmansgds> So freeze rounds are getting a nerf in Remake 3 huh
[4:11:13] <%dukenux> Milky Way Chocolate STAAAARS Kreygasm

[4:11:26] <%jcflyguy> OH they better be
[4:11:27] <%lionandfox21> Nemesis got L like I did
[4:11:32] <%Tenebrae94> Tenebrae94 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[4:11:32] <oniwahoo> Good Guy Nemesis: Removes all the zombies from the room before the boss fight
[4:11:34] <%NopeBadguy> what if there's just ONE freeze round in the whole game
[4:11:35] <%Aydarkzero> we'll just have to burn him then Kappa
[4:11:37] <%Agami23> they will probably be in remake just not as good
[4:11:39] <shabop> all the other zombies GAVE UP after they saw how much of a BIG HERO you are
[4:11:42] <ovan20> Nemesis isn't broken like that in the japanese version, there he has almost the same HP as Mister X :P
[4:11:46] <Goldteddy> Nemesis with mr X ai.....offf
[4:11:47] <ospreyworks> Hey Nemesis, what was the name of that respiratory disease going around a few years back? SAAAAAAAAAAAARS.
[4:11:48] <$insaneintentionsyo> resistance will be
[4:11:53] <skinmansgds> The railgun at the end will shoot a freeze round
[4:12:02] <stormhawk9891> Then you'd never use it
[4:12:05] <%Jekado> as long as the freeze round is op thats fine
[4:12:05] <rytisone> maybe some sort of cryo gun
[4:12:06] <+Demerson13> Any chance you'll play RE 0, Pat?
[4:12:11] <%FirearmsInstructor> @ospreyworks haznoJOKE haznoSOFT
[4:12:11] <Kalz0ne> is re3 also march?
[4:12:12] <%honeyman18> they throw it like Daniel in parasite eve
[4:12:12] <%mistermastergreg> !uptime
[4:12:13] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 12m.
[4:12:16] <%D3rrtyD4n> Mr. X was hella buff. i cant imagine how tough Nemesis will be.
[4:12:16] <devanmuse> Has anyone coined the term "threemake" yet?
[4:12:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[4:12:20] <faronmcsalty> omg that'd be rad
[4:12:22] <%davimotion96> Liquid nitrogen gun tho
[4:12:25] <+dheng1> Flame rounds are also good against him
[4:12:26] <skinmansgds> or like the Verdugo
[4:12:28] <FstSergeant8595> for some reason i find Mr X way creepier than Nemesis
[4:12:28] <%NopeBadguy> what if the nuke is just replaced with a giant freeze round
[4:12:31] <+kinmarik> T2 theme kicks in
[4:12:32] <%D3rrtyD4n> uh oh
[4:12:32] <%theodolitejones> Or just a note about them being lost in shipping
[4:12:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HASTA LA VISTA BABY
[4:12:35] <Artugoesblank> Will the dumb worm make it to remake?
[4:12:36] <%Schrodingers_Box> Replace the Railgun with a Cryogenic Storage system that slows him long enough for it to fire.
[4:12:38] <ospreyworks> @FirearmsInstructor I've made like a dozen!
[4:12:41] <trianglehat> fall off or fall off later
[4:12:41] <rytisone> THE BOX
[4:12:42] <%theodolitejones> "Those sure would have come in handy!"
[4:12:46] <+RowenCleric> ugh the stupid worm boss though
[4:12:47] <%bluebiscuit94> LUL the way she just stood there
[4:12:49] <%jillvxlentine> pat you should stream dino crisis one day!
[4:12:50] <%asgard147> limesD
[4:12:52] <JonEWorldbeater> You mean Demolition man
[4:12:57] <%FirearmsInstructor> @ospreyworks I know but I needed to call your ass out on that one LUL
[4:13:00] <%MaddyCaddy> Jumping off sucks too
[4:13:01] <%Valdorick> Nah son, just fall into the hole.
[4:13:04] <%spiritofmojave> no just fall into the pit LUL
[4:13:05] <Goldteddy> I wonder if these "Choices" will be in remake?
[4:13:05] <%MaddyCaddy> You get poisoned and shit
[4:13:07] <%D3rrtyD4n> no, just let go and FALL LUL
[4:13:12] <skinmansgds> You would only fall down if you're on a Kill All run
[4:13:12] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> fire a freeze round on my dick then my dick shatters
[4:13:12] <ospreyworks> @FirearmsInstructor Okay, maybe not my best.
[4:13:12] <%Schrodingers_Box> Does pat like Dino Crisis?
[4:13:13] <Judeknight> Boxes, truly the scariest enemies in a horror game.
[4:13:14] <+PlagueOfGripes> Mister X tosses you a rocket launcher, and a set of teddy bear keys
[4:13:16] <%NopeBadguy> i feel like that decision is more of a callback to the hole in re1 that barry drops the rope in than anything else
[4:13:18] <%SPKTR34> @Goldteddy they said in an interview that they won't
[4:13:18] <+Cyoctane> Worm is confirmed for REmak3
[4:13:19] <skinmansgds> There are worms down there
[4:13:19] <%D33TR> eat shit / dont eat shit || hmmmm what to do
[4:13:20] <trianglehat> you're just at a different part of the tunnel
[4:13:21] <rytisone> you go on a side adventure
[4:13:22] <+CloniiCory> @FstSergeant8595 X resembles a human more, but due to that lands harder in the uncanny valley. Whereas Nemesis is a cool-ass monster. That'd be my theory anyway.
[4:13:22] <%spiritofmojave> Jill LOVES death pits
[4:13:23] <Silverkry2> Nothing. you just have to climb up
[4:13:23] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat you get attacked by some dumb shit and go up a ladder outside LUL
[4:13:25] <phatballlz54> you j
[4:13:26] <majima666> dino crisis is HARD
[4:13:27] <+houseofnonsense> You fall into a single hallway with some snakes. That's it.
[4:13:29] <%theodolitejones> Is there a reason the music sounds drunk?
[4:13:30] <%Schrodingers_Box> Dino Crisis Remake.
[4:13:35] <Goldteddy> great
[4:13:35] <ovan20> @AngriestPat you go to one room sewer full of bugs
[4:13:38] <%Jekado> I I fell into the pit, You you fell into the PIT, WE WE ALL FEEEEELLL INTO THE PIIITTTT
[4:13:38] <scoopyoopydoo> dino crisis? more like Rhino Isis AMIRITE
[4:13:41] <ospreyworks> Jill just gets nailed in the face by a crate and instantly dies.
[4:13:41] <majima666> good game though
[4:13:47] <%NopeBadguy> it's like when barry dropped you down that hole in re1 basically
[4:13:48] <%jillvxlentine> you go down this little tunnel and come out of the manhole near the dead body outside
[4:13:51] <%SilverFaustX> dc2 was better
[4:13:55] <%NWR_James> NWR_James subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 14 months huh? I've probably done worse things for over a year. Probably.
[4:13:57] <Goldteddy> Dino Crisis Remake but with stupid feathered dinosaurs
[4:13:59] <%OldOnyx> you get harassed by snakes (worms) in a small space
[4:14:01] <xxinevitablexii> Is "Eagle's Petshop" a jojo?
[4:14:04] <akumakaizokun> @majima666 Dino Crisis's PUZZLES are hard
[4:14:07] <%InugamiTheHound> @scoopyoopydoo I LOL at the joke
[4:14:09] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> you go down a manhole and find Jay
[4:14:11] <+TungstenViper> Dino Crisis 2 is just an amazing game
[4:14:12] <%NopeBadguy> that's...actually probably a jojo @xxinevitablexii
[4:14:12] <FstSergeant8595> @BorinCorran Also Mr X just walks at you without saying ANYTHING super creepy. Nemesis saying STARS is a bit ridiculous imo
[4:14:13] <+CloniiCory> A plastic barrel falls on Jill and she gets crippled.
[4:14:13] <majima666> i prefer the first one, for the slower pace anyway
[4:14:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hey nemisis whats your favorite instrument? Gutaaaaarrrrssss
[4:14:24] <%theodolitejones> What's up with the drunk music?
[4:14:31] <%NopeBadguy> sic-eh-five
[4:14:34] <mankeytennis> Why doesn't Nemesis get slower as he fills up with bullets?
[4:14:34] <trianglehat> yeah I noticed the off music too
[4:14:35] <%Jekado> @BorinCorran does jill ask leon for a mercy killing
[4:14:35] <%SilverFaustX> woudnt mind a parasite eve remaster
[4:14:40] <%peachy996> Twitch
[4:14:45] <%D3rrtyD4n> will there be decision making moments like that in the remake?
[4:14:45] <ospreyworks> @theodolitejones Music sounds fine to me.
[4:14:51] <%D3rrtyD4n> its a twitch thing
[4:14:52] <%Caped_Eggy> Sounds normal to me
[4:14:52] <%spiritofmojave> It's Twitch probably
[4:14:53] <%Maids4lyfe> it sounds fine to me
[4:14:53] <$insaneintentionsyo> you should beat this tonight, this game isn't long
[4:14:53] <%SoFarFetched> sounds fine for me
[4:14:54] <%theodolitejones> Weird. It sounds really odd to me.
[4:14:56] <alrobot2014> reload the page if you hear it warped
[4:14:56] <%Aydarkzero> twitch does that
[4:14:56] <Ranger747> Yeah Twitch does stuff
[4:14:56] <+TungstenViper> It's audio compression bullshit
[4:14:57] <%Jekado> twitch has been acting strange
[4:14:57] <%peachy996> It's always Twitch guys
[4:14:58] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Yeah there's definite weird distortion
[4:15:01] <nehaerys> normal for me
[4:15:09] <+CloniiCory> @Jekado Obviously.
[4:15:10] <ospreyworks> When in doubt, blame Twitch.

[4:23:13] <%Maids4lyfe> hope so
[4:23:14] <akumakaizokun> Freeze Rounds = RE4 knife
[4:23:18] <+PlainClothesHero> @AngriestPat will u ever play Code Veronica?
[4:23:31] <%TheQButton> @AngriestPat your doing fine.

[4:23:41] <%JJCheeker> Is gonna play the bad game
[4:23:42] <$zackalan> Man, the Resident evil 3 remake isn't as good as I thought it was going to be KappaHD
[4:23:43] <%Agami23> its sad that the strongest weapon in all of resident evil is the CVX knife
[4:23:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead_TK
[4:23:45] <%theodolitejones> I just watched a longplay of Code Veronica
[4:23:46] <%Jekado> they replace freeze rounds in RE3remake with the TMP to spite pat

[4:24:00] <%theodolitejones> Oh lawd he comin
[4:24:00] <mankeytennis> Nemesis, what is an unacceptable, derogatory term for the mentally handicapped?
[4:24:02] <%jillvxlentine> im playing code veronica at the moment and its just as much bullshit as you remember
[4:24:03] <$WackyXmand> Cant wait for Ashford's weird ass voice.

[4:24:36] <+RowenCleric> code veronica has some super cool parts, like when Claire first arrives at Antarctica
[4:24:40] <%ClaudeMcGarren> why wouldnt you cheese?
[4:24:42] <%FirearmsInstructor> Not following
[4:24:43] <ospreyworks> CVX needs a remake pretty bad.
[4:24:47] <Artugoesblank> Would you stop playing a game if it's too difficult for you Pat?
[4:24:50] <%InugamiTheHound> @Clu_Flynn pat has played RECV it was for shitstorm and he quit when the big worms shwoed up
[4:24:51] <%FirearmsInstructor> Playing defense LUL
[4:24:54] <akumakaizokun> Nemesis is lactose intolerant
[4:24:54] <Dragovus> Nemisis demands a fair fight
[4:24:57] <%dukenux> No point in fighting Nemesis once you get TEH MAGNUM
[4:24:59] <%Jekado> he just fucked off
[4:25:04] <+PlainClothesHero> How could they possibly remake steve well?
[4:25:06] <Clu_Flynn> @inugamithehound I totally forgot about that one
