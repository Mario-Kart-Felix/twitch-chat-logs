[0:55:21] <+Keiyum> birbtime
[0:55:31] <GuyverTypeL> boss weapons! down right the road
[0:55:32] <+Rekinsinn> @greasypete00 If there's a hub with unlockable areas, I'd be shocked if it was roguelike
[0:55:40] <%polothegreatest> Ah, a good fallout plot: Who stole my soul? psaBougie
[0:55:44] <%YakumoYomi> @Dakuu75 Now THERE'S an interesting plot for a game
[0:55:45] <%Dakuu75> tiny jank there
[0:55:48] <NeroInfinite> If you could hit with it LUL
[0:55:50] <otakon17> THROUGH the headstone!
[0:56:00] <otakon17> big helmets are three
[0:56:10] <NeroInfinite> consoom froot
[0:56:14] <+YabbaTroll> ooooh your liighting a bonfire with plants?
[0:56:18] <otakon17> you used up ONE seed to heal
[0:56:19] <NeroInfinite> wasted
[0:56:24] <+YabbaTroll> but the bonfire is an estus?
[0:56:39] <ergulor> a key
[0:56:40] <otakon17> the combat has a nice punch
[0:56:43] <otakon17> no healing items so far
[0:56:45] <NeroInfinite> key
[0:56:46] <otakon17> just healing STATIONS
[0:56:51] <s1rcuit> @YabbaTroll I don't think so, the other enemies didn't come back, I think it's just a stationary single use estus
[0:56:52] <%BettyMwwaahh> there is a little too much screen movement i think
[0:56:53] <Sunstalker> sign sign sign PogChamp
[0:56:55] <otakon17> so looks like NO healing IN combat thus far
[0:57:08] <+Keiyum> yeah love this game
[0:57:12] <+YabbaTroll> @s1rcuit gotcha, neat
[0:57:26] <NeroInfinite> I hate that
[0:57:30] <+Ipsenscastle> ooh if i recall correctly this was developed in Manchester where I live
[0:57:38] <s1rcuit> the combat reminds me of Hob a little
[0:58:02] <%RealThiele> big number
[0:58:03] <+ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt So are you playing a Kenku Sith Lord or somthing?
[0:58:05] <ergulor> nh the corpse of an old one
[0:58:06] <%thotbane> Man remember Bastion? that was a good game
[0:58:13] <s1rcuit> the collide with the corpse of their ally, cool
[0:58:21] <Dunmarkh> @thotbane 10 years
[0:58:23] <ExpressNode> Music sounds pretty good
[0:58:26] <s1rcuit> @thotbane you said "is" wrong
[0:58:28] <otakon17> this is some very PUNCHY combat
[0:58:38] <%RealThiele> Kenku Shinigami
[0:58:42] <+Ipsenscastle> feels a bit like Hyper Light Drifter
[0:58:51] <%thotbane> @thotbane July 20, 2011 Fuck
[0:58:55] <%AgniBrandt> So, a tip from someone who finished the game today: The game never tells you what those metal grates are for, but you can use them immediately--use a plunging attack on them
[0:58:58] <+Patch_TheSquid> Reminds me of Blue Fire
[0:59:10] <NeroInfinite> kill 'em
[0:59:11] <%thotbane> SAME
[0:59:14] <otakon17> No gravedigger we ain't here for you

[1:00:18] <%AgniBrandt> Well, I tried
[1:00:21] <%ejackalope> I'm really enjoying the BGM for this game.
[1:00:29] <%NitronStreams> I thought that said "and a homie to stray souls"
[1:00:32] <%Ziegsy> I hope hes not your designated soul
[1:00:41] <+FoolsArcade> This game seems like Zelda Souls
[1:00:44] <s1rcuit> @NitronStreams could be both
[1:00:56] <otakon17> SWOLES acquired NOW we upgrade!
[1:01:01] <+ScreamLord> Huge Souls

[1:03:27] <TheWildOnion> Look at that bird smoking away.
[1:03:31] <otakon17> Melee it is XD
[1:03:38] <otakon17> NICE immediate upgrade
[1:03:38] <NeroInfinite> that is very noticble
[1:03:43] <KetsuoTaberu> makes your sword longer lionNice
[1:03:46] <+Zeromaru2> BIRDS WITH MUSCLES
[1:03:46] <otakon17> and you do I guess TWO damage per hit
[1:03:50] <%GinAndRoses> now that's girthy
[1:03:50] <%thotbane> Whats the plot?
[1:03:57] <otakon17> nope still two hits to kill
[1:03:59] <%Ziegsy> Fun fact! crows like to steal lit cigarettes because they use the smoke to clean parasites from their feathers
[1:04:08] <otakon17> so that means the damage increas is only like, 50%
[1:04:11] <+fetrigon> THICC MEATY WINGS
[1:04:13] <NeroInfinite> your shot is magic so it still tiny and smol
[1:04:29] <+fetrigon> *SWINGS
[1:04:35] <%thotbane> @Ziegsy How the FUCK do they know that smoke kills itchies
[1:04:36] <otakon17> nice shot
[1:04:42] <MidnightPacif1c> fight like a crow
[1:04:51] <%thotbane> it scares me how smart crows are sometimes
[1:04:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> Corvids have high INT stat
[1:05:01] <+fetrigon> nah
[1:05:06] <Dunmarkh> @Ziegsy crows are smart and they teach eachother to use tools
[1:05:09] <yourliteraldog> crows are cool
[1:05:27] <HaroldDonchee> that dude had a keyface
[1:05:27] <yourliteraldog> if you feed crows the bring you loot
[1:05:45] <unclerizla> just tuned in. So this looks like hyper light drifter
[1:05:46] <TheWildOnion> Bet the roll attack works better one bosses.
[1:05:50] <PizzicatoFive5> are we ever playing Cris Tales?

[1:15:55] <%Valdorick> This is just the Giaden Game of what the Treasure Crows were doing between the Chosen Undead/Seeker of Souls/Ashen One giving them shit.
[1:16:11] <yourliteraldog> Helps to have a map
[1:16:16] <DianaTheAscian> the real old fashion way
[1:16:31] <%thotbane> @Valdorick Co-op focused game for Pump a Rum and Pickle Pee
[1:16:34] <Reanimator83> Is that a fog door?
[1:16:37] <Visorak6> Like Sekiro?
[1:16:38] <%crimsonharvest> like the map in Control
[1:16:40] <Ombrebird> birdsouls
[1:16:43] <%greasypete00> like the sekiro map?
[1:16:44] <Siconia> It's an actual real map, you have to figure out where you are yourself
[1:16:44] <+YabbaTroll> like sekiro's thing
[1:16:46] <KetsuoTaberu> what if it's like the mass effect 2 citadel map
[1:16:47] <+Draegen86> like the skyrim map?
[1:16:48] <Dunmarkh> you have to draw the map
[1:16:50] <AoiRob> as useful as the shadow of the colossus map
[1:16:50] <Gregorhasjoined> Like the map in Sekiro exactly
[1:16:54] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @PatStaresAt You mean like the MInimap in Nioh 1 and 2?
[1:16:57] <%cvp5127> gotta use landmarks
[1:16:58] <yourliteraldog> I feel like you will have to navigate by land markers
[1:17:02] <ToneBacas> oh yeah Sekiro had a useless map
[1:17:03] <%RealThiele> one single layer that doesnt care about Z
[1:17:03] <Meekest> City of Tears elevator in Hollow Knight too
[1:17:04] <%OrangeMDT> It‚Äôs going to be disappointing with how clear it is
[1:17:09] <%Bane_Kaikyo> OH MY GOD YOUR RIGHT!?!?!..... DARK SOULS INVENTED SHITTY ELEVATORS!!!
[1:17:12] <%Monkeyweed21> its topography with no names on it
[1:17:18] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt its gonna be like the one is sekiro
[1:17:19] <%crimsonharvest> you know what game had a good representative map was the printed feelie with Wizardry 7
[1:17:20] <%RealThiele> city of tears fits better
[1:17:20] <%Ziegsy> im sad this is microsoft only rn.

[1:17:34] <nyacoo> what if there won't be a map
[1:17:34] <%polothegreatest> this game looks right in my alley woolieU
[1:17:39] <%thotbane> I like how Control has a map but also is very vertical, so you can't know for sure. Also no waypoints ever
[1:17:47] <T_Sasquatch> people have drawn maps for every from soft game , i expect it wi;ll be solved easily
[1:17:49] <%RealThiele> THERES SAND LIKE STAR WARS
[1:18:00] <%crimsonharvest> This place gives me big Grimrock 2 third area vibe

[1:18:51] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Zelda invented arrows that are on FIRE
[1:18:51] <+redthebaron> this game sounds so good
[1:18:51] <%NitronStreams> I think the people that made this game may have played a few games before
[1:19:05] <%SilvaChariot0133> maybe Kappa
[1:19:09] <Goatllama> LUL
[1:19:11] <KetsuoTaberu> bird can't swim

[1:19:23] <%JoshManVGH> Foolish pat, birds do not swim
[1:19:24] <%RealThiele> NO, this is brand new with zero outside influences of course
[1:19:26] <Siconia> Just like rats
[1:19:27] <%NitronStreams> much like rats
[1:19:27] <%RonaldMcDownload> Ducks are fake
[1:19:28] <AoiRob> crows cant swim
[1:19:34] <%Valdorick> Birds that swim don't swim, they fly on the surface of the water.
[1:19:35] <%saadi90> Birds, like rats, can‚Äôt swim
[1:19:36] <%JoshManVGH> Therefor ducks are not birds
[1:19:37] <%SilvaChariot0133> *Insert Clemps' "Heck yeah i played vidya gaem"*
[1:19:42] <AoiRob> is this the nexus
[1:19:52] <+Draegen86> ... that's an eldritch crow.. four eyes
[1:19:54] <stardustcrusad3r> so chat is this game of the year
[1:19:56] <AoiRob> bearer seek seek lefst
[1:19:56] <s1rcuit> I think magic will give you more arrows
[1:20:05] <%RetroCop87> It's funny, but despite being called rats with wings, pigeons CAN swim
[1:20:07] <%RealThiele> this is just like the nexus in that you spend currency here
[1:20:14] <%Monkeyweed21> lol
[1:20:23] <$Futurecity10> Pat you never beat Breath did you
[1:20:24] <%blue8moon> do the healing flowers replenish?

[1:22:11] <otakon17> BOO! no mid air slice!
[1:22:22] <lonosis47> Theyre trying really hard to make this game memorable but it just isnt
[1:22:26] <AoiRob> damn i need to buy this game
[1:22:33] <i_chevalier> it's a xbox exclusive, now I'm sad
[1:22:34] <otakon17> healing pot!
[1:22:37] <yourliteraldog> Isn't onion knight just refrence to that one guy from the ASOIF
[1:22:45] <AoiRob> but my backlog
[1:22:51] <%thotbane> @lonosis47 the problem is there's just so many like it
[1:22:53] <andiianfii> this is giving me big hyper light drifter vibes in terms of gameplay
[1:22:54] <Tisaric> it's on PC as well and I doubt it takes a beefy rig
[1:22:58] <s1rcuit> one of those statues has a plaque
[1:23:00] <otakon17> shortcuts UNLOCKED
[1:23:06] <%polothegreatest> xbox AND PC
[1:23:10] <%Ziegsy> I dunno this game looks charming
[1:23:12] <Siconia> Yeah man I feel that
[1:23:18] <%bread_assassin> With us?
[1:23:20] <%thotbane> @yourliteraldog I mean, Siegmeyer is based on Bazuzo in Berserk so i think its really just a coincidence
[1:23:22] <%Mendin> No that onion knight smuggled onions and got knighted, souls onion knight wore an onion hat
[1:23:23] <%bevyrage> same flute
[1:23:23] <%Ziegsy> if it was on ps4 id have bought it already
[1:23:24] <Siconia> Pumped up for more Ghost
[1:23:25] <+trackles_64> ANd it will be perfect for new vod content
[1:23:26] <%baka_sugoi> cuz its a good game
[1:23:26] <%blue8moon> cause leaves?
[1:23:28] <%Deft_Thought> Probably the leaves
[1:23:29] <+Ipsenscastle> probably the leaves
[1:23:32] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Has paige played Village. And can you make her play it on stream?
[1:23:32] <%JoshManVGH> I feel the same way with Death Strand8ng
[1:23:34] <%General_Terro> i finished it but i want to play it again
[1:23:35] <+ThomasOfTroy> Asia-influenced level = red leaves
[1:23:35] <%bravebravesrobin> 100% the GOAT
[1:23:38] <lonosis47> This game makes you think about wanting to play other games
[1:23:38] <%BinaryFireball> I dont like tsushima and I feel weird about it
[1:23:40] <+BloodyBurney> because DOSHO?
[1:23:41] <%Puhff> Ghost actually ends on a wet fart imo
[1:23:42] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Also pat the wind flutes are very tsushima
[1:23:42] <+trackles_64> We have nothign to watch tho
[1:23:43] <%NitronStreams> Mhost of tsushima
[1:23:46] <Visorak6> The co-op would make a nice one off
[1:23:52] <DonatelloJose> you put in the time with us
[1:23:54] <%thotbane> @ThomasOfTroy Asians invented autumn
[1:23:56] <Gregorhasjoined> I'd totally watch a 100% run on PC
[1:23:59] <DianaTheAscian> its very solid
[1:24:03] <%polothegreatest> to the wishlist u go game psaJpeg
[1:24:04] <s1rcuit> has anyone made the Death Stranding joke calling it Death Branding?
[1:24:04] <%Mendin> Is that some oboe?
[1:24:05] <%JoshManVGH> @binaryfireball Why do you feel weird about that?
[1:24:33] <%thotbane> @s1rcuit What are you talking about? *opens can of Monster energy drink‚Ñ¢*
[1:24:40] <%NitronStreams> Hey look ammo
[1:24:57] <Tisaric> it's such a fun mechanic
[1:24:58] <Born_2_Late> is this a Hades?
[1:25:15] <yourliteraldog> It is good system
[1:25:19] <+Bperelsztein> this is a souls
[1:25:20] <Visorak6> You dont have to worry about hoarding ammo yeah
[1:25:21] <+ThomasOfTroy> @ThomasOfTroy Asians invented autumn and Slavs invented winter, but who invented spring and summer??
[1:25:24] <Enn19> Hollow Knight too!
[1:25:26] <AoiRob> hollow knight does it too with magic and healing
[1:25:44] <%Valdorick> Ironically, the shitty RPG for the N64, Quest 64, did it before Hyper Light Drifter Kappa
[1:25:51] <lonosis47> Hyper light drifter and then theres this game
[1:25:58] <DianaTheAscian> its so fun
[1:26:35] <%Valdorick> Hyperlight FUCKING, because it fucking rules
[1:26:36] <%Bane_Kaikyo> it's real hard tho
[1:26:42] <Visorak6> Is it hard as balls or pretty middle of the road?
[1:26:44] <Saltmeisterr> is gud
[1:26:48] <SunsetJack> It was a free game on EPIC too.
[1:26:50] <%basswizard11> look at these Wizrobe mother fuckers
[1:26:53] <AoiRob> hype for Solar Ash!
[1:26:58] <Saltmeisterr> id say its fairly hard
[1:26:59] <andiianfii> it's middle of the road
[1:27:00] <Tisaric> it was hard to get into it because of the difficulty but once you get it down it's really good
[1:27:04] <%JoshManVGH> It looks cool but I am super lost in my save
[1:27:05] <$Futurecity10> Yeah, do 500 hyper dashes in a row mother fucker
[1:27:07] <Tisaric> and yeah Solar Ash looks fucking great
[1:27:08] <andiianfii> its easy to get really good at it
[1:27:09] <%spongeofmystery> Booooo
[1:27:10] <%thotbane> @Visorak6 Its fucking hard. I lost momentum on a boss and i just never picked it up
[1:27:11] <DianaTheAscian> its middle of the road
[1:27:12] <%bevyrage> wait is that a secret?
[1:27:15] <TrollKing96> I get lost in Hyper Light Drifter.
[1:27:16] <%maskofmichael> That's what she said
[1:27:18] <%animaturgy> phrasing...?
[1:27:20] <%thotbane> like, i just, stopped playing
[1:27:23] <%notsoy> sit with the pothead
[1:27:25] <%Valdorick> White knuckle sounds like a sex thing.
[1:27:26] <%Ziegsy> 'Partake of my soup'
[1:27:26] <Saltmeisterr> @Futurecity10 that shit is fucked up tho foreal
[1:27:27] <+lordericter> thanks onion knight
[1:27:28] <yourliteraldog> Hyper Light drifter was fun i should go back to it
[1:27:28] <%Mendin> Siegbrau time
[1:27:31] <DianaTheAscian> I can think of 2 bosses that are really hard but everything else is fine
[1:27:31] <$TrashManJonesy> I white knuckle it like two to three times a day.
[1:27:37] <+Draegen86> Must take everything seriously, including relaxing - not white knuckling it? then you can't ever say you've given it your 110% :P
[1:27:39] <%thotbane> I mean its easy to get lost since there's zero writing or dialogue ever
[1:27:55] <Reanimator83> Did not like the map design in Hyperlight
[1:27:56] <+Ipsenscastle> Hyper Light isn't terribly hard to complete, but to do it 100% would require ridiculous effort
[1:28:00] <yourliteraldog> Try his soup
[1:28:05] <+lordericter> taste of the soup
[1:28:10] <AoiRob> social link UP
[1:28:11] <%RetroCop87> would you drink head soup?
[1:28:15] <%NitronStreams> "You have increased your relationship level with Pothead. Pothead will now die for you"
[1:28:15] <CrimsonGargoyle> he looks like a good pothead
[1:28:16] <+Keiyum> Would you be comfortable drinking someone's head soup?
[1:28:18] <Enn19> The soup is his ESSENCE
[1:28:19] <%Bane_Kaikyo> that was a mean pot
[1:28:21] <%Puhff> Oh wow Pothead get it? Cuz weed
[1:28:24] <%Ziegsy> HOOOY!
[1:28:25] <lonosis47> Pats only playing this for today
[1:28:31] <yourliteraldog> I'd drink the soup
[1:28:35] <%blue8moon> it was the opposite of healing Kappa
[1:28:41] <%Valdorick> Can't the 500 hyperdashes be defeated by just making a macro?
[1:28:46] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt btw did you ever finish p5r in your free time or naw?
[1:29:00] <Visorak6> This game has a really wonderful use of shaders on a simplistic artstyle
[1:29:16] <%Ziegsy> I keep hearing links sister
[1:29:19] <+ThomasOfTroy> That's a shame, it's really good
[1:29:19] <+Vladewind> Can you destroy signs?
[1:29:22] <%NitronStreams> OOOOOOOH Secrets
[1:29:23] <s1rcuit> I don't like that the scream
[1:29:31] <andiianfii> @Valdorick yuup
[1:29:37] <Tisaric> yeah they like hiding secrets with the perspective only to move the camera, it's fun
[1:29:39] <yourliteraldog> More blood than I thought there would be
[1:29:51] <$KnivesEve> hey its that birb game
[1:30:00] <%thotbane> If i played i'd probably need to start over. Without text I have no clue where the fuck I was game-wise
[1:30:09] <yourliteraldog> mini boss
[1:30:10] <%thotbane> but yeah you can macro the 500 dashes
[1:30:11] <Dunmarkh> He's a big guy
[1:30:20] <DianaTheAscian> oh no now you need to check every corner
[1:30:22] <Tisaric> it recontextualizes the world a bit which is fun, you're expecting everything to be only modeled for this view
[1:30:23] <%thotbane> UUUU
[1:30:40] <%Ziegsy> this game is missing a dedicated 'caw' button
[1:30:45] <%thotbane> in Hard Mode of Hotline Miami 2 they flip the map view
[1:30:46] <roobanguy> for some reason im getting real fable vibes from the music
[1:31:03] <xeros720> oh, got it
[1:31:12] <Gregorhasjoined> Draw a heart shape
[1:31:13] <roobanguy> make a heart :)
[1:31:22] <Tisaric> the music is so good at getting the whimsical nature across
[1:31:27] <%Puhff> pat's urn pattern
[1:31:28] <%BlackStarAura> Shadow puzzles
[1:31:28] <%Mendin> Maybe read the glowy placard on the other side?
[1:31:29] <TrollKing96> Bet the Witch's manor is like Aldia's Keep.
[1:31:33] <%Mendin> Or was that what said Garden of Love?
[1:31:43] <%cvp5127> soup?
[1:31:59] <%Puhff> BAD ENDING UNLOCKED
[1:32:02] <$SGrim> Pat, you've killed him.
[1:32:08] <%thotbane> Well if this is really souls then Pothead will die without your help
[1:32:09] <KetsuoTaberu> soup.
[1:32:09] <AoiRob> i feel like soupbro's not gonna last
[1:32:15] <DianaTheAscian> is rolling faster or is it just habit?
[1:32:21] <+CarrowayFashonti> Welp that npc is super duper dead
[1:32:25] <vonmaultke> this music reminds me of Moonlighter
[1:32:31] <%NitronStreams> they seem to refore after you break five
[1:32:34] <%OrangeMDT> Random question: did Pat talk about the evils of Activision pre-stream?
[1:32:43] <%bevyrage> oh pat if you need to make a heart
[1:32:45] <yourliteraldog> how heart?
[1:32:46] <%NitronStreams> restore*
[1:32:48] <%bevyrage> bottom left, bottom right, top row
[1:32:52] <%mike2hands> Hey guys, how‚Äôs the game?
[1:33:06] <%Puhff> @OrangeMDT oh yeah
[1:33:07] <+redthebaron> 2 vs?
[1:33:10] <%bevyrage> point the heart towards the bottom right
[1:33:10] <%thotbane> @mike2hands its a Supergiant/Souls game
[1:33:16] <%bevyrage> dammit
[1:33:21] <Tisaric> hmmmm
[1:33:21] <DianaTheAscian> make a heart?
[1:33:22] <SunsetJack> Wrong perspective maybe?
[1:33:23] <RogueMinja> Can you make a heart?
[1:33:24] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Not a diagonal heart
[1:33:28] <%Mendin> Does that little placard on the bottom have the same words as the one on the grave at the top?
[1:33:33] <SunsetJack> Hmm, maybe not.
[1:33:33] <Tisaric> I didn't figure this one out either
[1:33:34] <xeros720> here, a hint: VirtualHug
[1:33:39] <+OhioNitsud> i can't visualize how to do this
[1:33:48] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Huh
[1:33:55] <%Puhff> try drawing a big peen
[1:33:58] <DianaTheAscian> hmm
[1:34:13] <+ThomasOfTroy> Wrong perspective
[1:34:16] <%BlackStarAura> Family family family
[1:34:16] <MrJoeJoe> try an x for kiss
[1:34:17] <%Agami23> maybe with the top of the heart phasing the tomb?
[1:34:20] <%Monkeyweed21> draw Vin Diesel
[1:34:22] <+bugz_munny> make a dickbutt
[1:34:24] <Visorak6> Does the puzzle only reset once you hit the fifth one or a specific couple of pots?
[1:34:36] <SunsetJack> Can he do this is my question?
[1:34:44] <Visorak6> So it must onl be five you need to remove yeah
[1:34:50] <%Agami23> so a heart phasing northwest maybe?
[1:34:51] <%polothegreatest> i cant see the VirtualHug
[1:34:55] <Tisaric> I never found the info myself but I'm not much further than you
[1:34:59] <+Draegen86> shiny placard at the entrance
[1:35:01] <+Draegen86> ?
[1:35:03] <SaltyAzteca> Brute force it Kappa
[1:35:11] <AoiRob> i think i know what it is
[1:35:11] <%RetroCop87> 5 swings
[1:35:13] <skeletonman9000> usedSip oroLurk
[1:35:22] <+OhioNitsud> you can't brute force love
[1:35:27] <Visorak6> Is it a heart with the point at the couple?
[1:35:29] <CyberRank10> <3
[1:35:30] <bettysharkface> How many pots can your arrows take out?
[1:35:30] <KetsuoTaberu> Do you want to know if you can do this yet
[1:35:31] <%Mendin> I think it's supposed to be aligned with the tomb as the top, not the camera "north"
[1:35:34] <%notsoy> heart-shape? chop one end row, and the remaining corners
[1:35:40] <2Bs_USB_port> is this a rogue?
[1:35:41] <+Draegen86> yeah just look at how that worked out at irvine >.>
[1:35:43] <i_chevalier> who said it have to be a heart
[1:35:43] <Tisaric> he's done that though
[1:35:48] <%Prism_Wing> Brute love!
[1:35:51] <+fetrigon> not if I have anything to say about it majinoSkiip
[1:35:51] <%bevyrage> i just looked up the solution. you don't make a heart, you have to knock out a pattern in a specific order to manage it
[1:35:55] <%RetroCop87> no
[1:35:56] <Yrefe> all 4 corners and the second one on the top
[1:35:58] <Visorak6> Try opposite of that
[1:36:04] <%bevyrage> i don't see where you find the pattern though
[1:36:08] <%Ziegsy> Oh I looked it up, its a very specific order
[1:36:09] <%RetroCop87> that's not a heart Pat, that's a pumpkin
[1:36:09] <%SirGO0SE> if i tilt my head i can see it i guess
[1:36:15] <+Archmortal> with camera north you keep breaking the bottom tip of what would be the heart
[1:36:15] <AoiRob> maybee break the four forming an inner diamond, and the one at the very top?
[1:36:15] <Yrefe> oh come on that was a hearth
[1:36:15] <%Ziegsy> its not a pattern
[1:36:17] <+FemmeAndroid> Could you do an X by hitting 4 then bowing the other slash?
[1:36:23] <Visorak6> Huh
[1:36:30] <Tisaric> it's apparently info you need to find elsewhere
[1:36:50] <SunsetJack> You don't have the info to do this yet.
[1:36:51] <%bevyrage> solution to that puzzle is further ahead on critical path
[1:36:52] <SaltyAzteca> This reeks of RE puzzle and I like it
[1:36:52] <%JoshManVGH> What if it's an arrow
[1:36:57] <bettysharkface> I'm worried about Onion Soup
[1:37:01] <%Monkeyweed21> its the family tomb so you need to draw Dominic Torreto
[1:37:01] <%JoshManVGH> Like Cupids Arrow
[1:37:08] <%Valdorick> T H I C C
[1:37:10] <%Mendin> Thart's JUST THE BERENIKE KNIGHT
[1:37:10] <+lordericter> its the pillsbury smough boy
[1:37:13] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt maybe make an X for the old symbol from X's and O's meaning hugs and kisses.

[3:09:59] <+hyren21> I'm sold on buying this game but I have to ask: is the screen shake a setting you can turn off?
[3:10:16] <%Ziegsy> SOUL

[3:12:13] <%RealThiele> baguette rat rat oui oui
[3:12:14] <usurper_sos> He is speaking a dead language: french
[3:12:18] <%GabeSweetMan> Pat's English language center of the brain needed time to revive.
[3:12:19] <dinnydanny777> It looks like the guy who buys Poe's in Ocarina of Time
[3:12:30] <akitanito> big scared
[3:12:39] <%toolofparanoia> Dammit pat we can't speak quebecois
[3:12:57] <%Mendin> Nobody can, it's ok

[3:13:05] <dinnydanny777> spidey NotLikeThis
[3:13:22] <%RonaldMcDownload> Is it hard to see the enemies telegraph on your screen, Pat? It looks rough from here
[3:13:26] <%Mendin> Blasphemous was also pretty great yeah
[3:13:30] <%Ziegsy> His back looks like that cheesecake paige tweeted about
[3:13:43] <%AncelDeLambert> should probably backtrack and heal
[3:13:48] <%BlackStarAura> Eww
[3:13:49] <%Mendin> Woolie's Secret Cheesecake?
[3:13:55] <stfnotguilty> I tell you hwat, the brightness of this game is all over the place.

[3:14:43] <%Ziegsy> turn on his mic
[3:14:53] <%HairballCT> not really but i'm sure it sounds adorable

[3:15:18] <akitanito> pat souls died
[3:15:20] <%Monkeyweed21> need a hookshot and bomb arrows
[3:15:24] <%NitronStreams> F
[3:15:28] <%greasypete00> thats unfortunate
[3:15:31] <%AncelDeLambert> y'know, maybe I SHOULDN'T be able to tell that your game has a hookshot mechanic just by looking at it
[3:15:33] <%Ziegsy> scuttle scuttle scuttle
[3:15:38] <KetsuoTaberu> at least there's a tall ladder back up
[3:15:40] <%AyotoCorp> What's up the ladder
[3:15:46] <%SilvaChariot0133> Ladder
[3:15:53] <Dunmarkh> die?\
[3:15:53] <+fetrigon> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[3:15:53] <%Monkeyweed21> wrong way
[3:15:58] <%AncelDeLambert> what's wrong with textured walls, is all I'm saying
[3:15:58] <%HairballCT> pat did you ever go up the ladder
[3:16:03] <Mundkipz> it's a zelda game tho
[3:16:06] <stfnotguilty> Hey Pat...would you be interested in trying an online card game WWF made in 2000 that was way ahead of its time and is kept alive by mildly crazy fans who built their own p2p matchmaking interface?
[3:16:09] <%AyotoCorp> psaBlind
[3:16:13] <KetsuoTaberu> top right
[3:16:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> That ladder $head
[3:16:13] <Dunmarkh> holy shit
[3:16:17] <%AncelDeLambert> the one you just turned away from
[3:16:17] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> back up a level
[3:16:18] <+fetrigon> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[3:16:29] <TonberryLives> Such is the nature of a Zelda-like
[3:16:33] <%asgard147> limesBlind limesBlind limesBlind
[3:16:34] <Dunmarkh> NotLikeThis
[3:16:36] <%SilvaChariot0133> Yeah it's a weird room
[3:16:46] <%Monkeyweed21> yes it was
[3:16:47] <DianaTheAscian> being able to predict mechanics correctly is a bit unsatisfying for me
[3:17:08] <ergulor> yeah
[3:17:09] <%FacetiousAF> hell yeah
[3:17:14] <%RonaldMcDownload> Ayup
[3:17:15] <%Ziegsy> I didnt get that far ;;
[3:17:16] <ergulor> darksiders 1 was great
[3:17:16] <%FacetiousAF> let's have some portal puzzles
[3:17:19] <+Zeromaru2> maybe talk to the crow at the summit?
[3:17:29] <%Monkeyweed21> it even had the same colors
[3:17:30] <thehullowed> Yup, it was pretty neat.
[3:17:34] <gnarly_memes_bro> yeah it was used for like 4 shitty puzzles and then you beat the game
[3:17:38] <DianaTheAscian> are those games good?
[3:17:51] <Visorak6> It was a worthy welda clone
[3:17:56] <Visorak6> welda? zelda
[3:17:56] <dinnydanny777> Darksiders 2 is so long
[3:17:59] <ergulor> i don't like the combat in 2
[3:18:02] <dinnydanny777> It's deceptively long
[3:18:06] <%RonaldMcDownload> I thought 2 dragged on way too long
[3:18:08] <%greasypete00> i think i remember that bug
[3:18:10] <%Shubreaker> daeksiders 2 is MUCH longer
[3:18:15] <%JoshManVGH> How was 3?
[3:18:18] <%DakotaMacDoodle> 2 was too much
[3:18:21] <anAngryHamster> I lost all interest in the series when the devs said they couldn't do anything interesting with Pestilence or Famine
[3:18:21] <%Ziegsy> is darksiders 2 the one with the horse and the worms?
[3:18:23] <%greasypete00> i liked the length of 2
[3:18:26] <Visorak6> 3 was yeesh
[3:18:28] <+TheotherKristian> I too was prevented from finishing Darksiders 2 but with a bug that corrupted my save file after 32 hours of progress
[3:18:29] <%UvBenServed> 2 had a lot of "Go get 3 of a thing to open this door"
[3:18:30] <gnarly_memes_bro> I never touched the sequels cause I heard they were ridiculously long
[3:18:31] <%DakotaMacDoodle> 3 was allright
[3:18:37] <%FacetiousAF> no 1 had the worms
[3:18:42] <%Monkeyweed21> why did pat take the long route?
[3:18:53] <Who_lio42> 3 was cool, just ran like shit
[3:18:58] <%FacetiousAF> for the content
[3:19:02] <%Ziegsy> 1 was the worms? heck
[3:19:03] <%JoshManVGH> Cause exploration
[3:19:05] <snipertheladiesman> 3 was pretty good, just has random loading that lock the game up
[3:19:32] <%greasypete00> YOOOO
[3:19:34] <%Prism_Wing> woah
