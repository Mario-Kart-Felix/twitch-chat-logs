[0:06:23] <%appletumtum> @starotter70 Yeah, they did the right thing there
[0:06:40] <$PadreHail> I think the biggest difference between Darth Maul and Vader is that Maul was always cool no matter what

[0:28:12] <%toomuchsnarfsnarf> Hmmmmm
[0:28:15] <knowyourenemy_97> Anyway....Persona 5 Royal
[0:28:15] <@SoFarFetched> Ganumero Uno
[0:28:17] <%heartlesshealer> for real though, learn to shawl. it's easier when you're not sitting
[0:28:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Shin Megami Tensei
[0:28:21] <+Rickets89> Trails of Cold Steel.....kind of
[0:28:31] <%starotter70> Mind 0... wait, nevermind
[0:28:31] <RubberFistFight> jesus christ Pat is there a rave going on there
[0:28:32] <knowyourenemy_97> Megami Tensei
[0:28:33] <+OddityOn> there was one but I can't remember the name
[0:28:35] <RubberFistFight> all the colours
[0:28:36] <%Jasuchin> Three times
[0:28:38] <+itslunchie> Sakura wars? But that's more of a dating sim/RTS but it is a variation on the RPG formula
[0:28:41] <%Aydarkzero> that's why i'll only ever play Persona 5
[0:28:43] <+itslunchie> Yeah that's similar
[0:28:46] <+MrAtheGreat> Ah, the Ryuji and Morgana arguments always make me smile.
[0:28:48] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> I beat P5R the other day and I still don't know what the Royal in the title means
[0:28:50] <%NopeBadguy> what about bully Kappa
[0:28:50] <+itslunchie> Trials of Cold Steel is pretty similar
[0:28:50] <%kewlmyc> That's still a school though
[0:28:51] <+scibren> scibren subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[0:28:54] <%Jeemukun> to be fair, the first 2 personas were nothing like 3-5
[0:28:55] <%Ganerumo> Bioware's games remind me of it but not nearly in the same degree
[0:28:55] <+itslunchie> but WAY crazier world building
[0:28:56] <@SoFarFetched> @RubberFistFight The Rave is called Persona 5 sipsipDab
[0:28:58] <%Jay_Squirrel> its not an opinion tho
[0:28:58] <ElenaManetta> i thought the "H" stood for honest
[0:28:59] <+Rickets89> Tokyo Xanadu is probably more similar than Cold Steel
[0:28:59] <+OddityOn> Tokyo Xanadu
[0:29:02] <%StaceMcGate> Trails of Cold Steel talks place at a school tho
[0:29:04] <%appletumtum> You can smell Discord?
[0:29:04] <+itslunchie> Literally like 9 games set in the same world
[0:29:05] <%Ancopro> In my CORRECT opinion
[0:29:10] <brothandelus> Sakura Wars
[0:29:11] <%dekkitout> Imho, the disc be smelly
[0:29:12] <%CursedNobleman> does trails of cold steel have waifu mechanics?
[0:29:12] <RubberFistFight> in my humble opinion the discord possess a stench that could be defined as "odious"
[0:29:12] <%starotter70> Yeah?
[0:29:13] <Dragovus> The Discord is a Smash player, WHAT?
[0:29:13] <%JonesMcFly> IMHO fuck star wars
[0:29:15] <%Meltdown547> The smug aura.
[0:29:16] <+itslunchie> Eh xanadu's gameplay is a little lacking in comparison to Trials
[0:29:17] <ExpressNode> Cold Steel is pretty good but WAY longer than Persona by a margin
[0:29:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Only the first Cold Steel, really
[0:29:22] <%SubjectTea> pat is so smug
[0:29:27] <%Jasuchin> Subjectivity is implied, no need to waste time
[0:29:32] <ElenaManetta> EVERYTHING does an auto-sub now-a-days

[0:29:43] <%WhereIsWill> drives me nuts
[0:29:46] <%dekkitout> No way- 4 REEL!?
[0:29:46] <+Rickets89> i love improvised economies
[0:29:46] <%appletumtum> I feel like "Evil John Cena" is a actual thing that happened

[0:35:10] <RetroCop87> every blitzball match is fun except for the stacked one against the aurochs

[0:40:10] <+RaveBV> Kamoshida isn't the most evil. It's the gangster guy who was worse. He literally did what Kamoshida did but on a larger scale AND sold the girls away.

[0:40:17] <+adimcorner> ask her to make you coffee
[0:40:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Paige is the only thing keeping this stream running
[0:40:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> That coffee tree must be swiss cheese by now
[0:40:19] <%heartlesshealer> Pat, Paige being lazy is a Victoria's Secret
[0:40:19] <NiktenKing> TIME TO DRILL THE COFFEE TREE
[0:40:19] <%cumurasame> @Yukai_Yami I actually found fusing in P1 to be better than 2, it's more tedious to grind but easy to break

[0:40:21] <ergulor> Tell her to answer on the chat
[0:40:25] <j0ustar> "Yes"

[0:40:31] <%JohnAtDawn> @optimasmaximas Persona 3. You don't get to choose the spells fusions inherit so you have to back out and reselect hoping for the spells you want.

[0:40:40] <%TenderBabyBacon> Kamoshida isn't the actual worst. The final boss literally kills a bunch of people for his goals

[0:40:49] <%Ynkubus18> good msitake
[0:40:55] <+DrFacilier> @RaveBV I feel like if we had seen more of the suffering Kaneshiro caused he'd be more despised than Kamoshida
[0:40:55] <%starotter70> Ah shit, here we go again

[0:41:19] <ElenaManetta> HELLO
[0:41:23] <+RaveBV> Okumura really was boring, especially her ***.
[0:41:24] <+RaveBV> :)
[0:41:25] <@commanderclaw> @FirearmsInstructor Hey
[0:41:38] <knowyourenemy_97> Okumura was a ploit device for Morganas charater growth. i'm not joking
[0:41:45] <+RaveBV> ^
[0:41:47] <%linkster291> Yes.
[0:41:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> play SWTOR
[0:41:54] <+itslunchie> SilverFaustX Yes, but people don't realize it because nobody reads the comics
[0:42:01] <%TaterBurglar> SWTOR MMO Mind Goblins let's go
[0:42:01] <%StaceMcGate> We still have like 14 more weeks of persona
[0:42:09] <%ScreamLord> Opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one and they're all full of shit
[0:42:09] <+itslunchie> The comics which reveals that Palpatine sired vader through the force
[0:42:13] <FirearmsInstructor> @Sphincter_Spelunker henlo :P
[0:42:19] <Dr_Angelic> by the time this is over, cyberpunk 2077 will be out; or at least ghost of tsushima
[0:42:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @FirearmsInstructor hello today
[0:42:22] <ExpressNode> I missed some of Pat's streams. Is he at the Okumura place?
[0:42:22] <%dekkitout> Pat on Pat bias PunOko
[0:42:23] <%StaceMcGate> This is Pat's dummy account
[0:42:28] <%heartlesshealer> he changed from alive to dead
[0:42:29] <$PadreHail> Morgana's character growth is kind of weak until like the last chunk of the story
[0:42:36] <%GohanHitsugaya> Those movies don't count
[0:42:40] <+itslunchie> and if you don't "count" that, if you do the math, palps was OLD and pruny as F when his son had to be alive so he probably had to sire him the same way
[0:42:41] <%bread_assassin> @ExpressNode Not even close.
[0:42:42] <%TrebassTV> Do you plan to finish Royal to completion on stream? I got a recording blocked message from PSN after a certain point and wondered if you had a special go-ahead
[0:42:42] <%dekkitout> Rogue One tho
[0:42:42] <knowyourenemy_97> Kratos is very dope
[0:42:47] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:42:49] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Sequel trilogy isnt canon
[0:42:51] <SilverFaustX> palpatine is vaders father isnt he ?
[0:42:53] <%GohanHitsugaya> They aren't real
[0:42:53] <@SoFarFetched> I thought she was saying "PEEETT MEEEEEE"
[0:42:54] <%starotter70> I hate sand
[0:42:54] <+EternalJedi> limesLUL DO NOT WANT
[0:42:56] <%NopeBadguy> Watch Clone Wars if you want an actually cool Anakin
[0:42:57] <knowyourenemy_97> NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:42:57] <+itslunchie> So if Rey is "Palpatine's granddaughter" by that extension then Vader is his son.
[0:42:58] <%Fadedblank247> tell us about sand Anakin
[0:42:58] <BoneofMalkav> "You Underrated my ability!" "IS!"
[0:42:58] <%Jasuchin> Yeah. Pretty much. That's kind of the point
[0:43:00] <%cureneckbeard> pat me
[0:43:05] <+meatmaaan> morgana having character depth?
[0:43:06] <%heartlesshealer> !
[0:43:09] <+Coolkevinator> ironically Morgana gets more interesting after his Confidant maxes out
[0:43:10] <FirearmsInstructor> @SoFarFetched wait she wasnt? What was she saying lmao I heard "PETTTTTTTTT MEEEEEEEEEEE!" too
[0:43:15] <ExpressNode> @bread_assassin Thanks. Just thought that since people were mentioning it in chat
[0:43:15] <%Ranryu692> no, Palpatine isn't Anakin's dad
[0:43:18] <@ShockzNDrawe> I have a funny image about that

[0:44:13] <%DappercatEsquire> cheer500 Pat, I just got back into MHW after bouncing off of it back at PC launch. I bought the Tyrant DLC for the handler, and the stupid anime mannerisms and voice coming from a horrible monster is really entertaining for me, and was worth $2.99. Has there ever been dumb DLC that was personally worth it to you?
[0:44:14] <%superchronicc> use the schwartz

[0:44:31] <%heartlesshealer> !
[0:44:35] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Apparently Kratos was cursed between games to be unable to kill himself and the Blades of Chaos are always bound to him. Fact Fiend has a video about it and it's kinda funny

[0:45:12] <%gasgrave> gasgrave subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! Because of you going through P5R I got back in myself. Aaaaaand into all things SMT. My brain is now a mushy pile of convoluted JRPG trash and demon summoning lore. That said Digital Devil Saga and Nocturne now fight as my favorites, and Raidou is so cool

[0:59:03] <OToole42> The W is all that matters
[0:59:05] <%Zombrocom> Those pyrhiic victory and stuff? That means literally nothing
[0:59:06] <%Mr_Pylon> unfortunately you get a feel for it over time, with what you can pull off with units you know
[0:59:12] <%afronooch> I want FFTR
[0:59:13] <ElenaManetta> pat would love gladiator days
[0:59:14] <NiktenKing> Oh man... I'd love an FFTactics remake ; A ;
[0:59:23] <%cureneckbeard> Pat you're talking about bloodsports again
[0:59:25] <%Taengoo31> FFT best FF
[0:59:26] <derap41> it if the manage to flee
[0:59:28] <%Jasuchin> Mutant Football League is great too
[0:59:31] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt depends on their stance
[0:59:32] <%briktal> they can retreat but only once per turn
[0:59:33] <+Bl3ssthefall3x> !uptime
[0:59:33] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 59m 44s.
[0:59:36] <%Shacklebox> you gotta hunt down the survivors
[0:59:37] <+Fenris_Alexius> If you kill them in settlements, they die, if they're out on the field and can run, they survivd
[0:59:37] <+itslunchie> i would, but i would like it to be more like FE 3H in terms of presentation
[0:59:37] <%heartlesshealer> tactics still holds up
[0:59:42] <Ell1ot> that sounds like some of them ran away
[0:59:42] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Good thing there is a new FFtactics game on mobile. Get it if you are fine with Gacha
[0:59:44] <+meatmaaan> there's the last of us within 2
[0:59:47] <%linkster291> They flee is the idea.
[0:59:48] <OToole42> if units break and run and you don't chase down the survivors like the filthy monsters they are
[0:59:49] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt you get one retreat before army totally destroyed
[0:59:51] <%baronouroboros> ye
[0:59:52] <SilverFaustX> they were routed
[0:59:52] <derap41> If survivors manage to flee the battlefield they can flee on the campaign map
[0:59:57] <%Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt If they are in normal stance, they can retreat. If they are in march stance, or already retreated, they will be wiped out
[1:00:02] <%heartlesshealer> gacha FF tactics sounds like a nightmare
[1:00:14] <ashinmyfac> Pat I love u
[1:00:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat, when's Gears Tactics
[1:00:23] <%trustycoyote> Nope. I have it sitting on my Steam wishlist
[1:00:33] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @itslunchie The document stated that there were like 26 people like Ellie but they all failed. Also, it makes no sense to kill your one current means of developing a cure. Wouldn't you want to run various tests and see what exactly makes them immune rather than just cutting out what you think is the cure?
[1:00:35] <NiktenKing> If CyGames could only collab with Square to make FF Tactics remake
[1:00:36] <$PadreHail> Neil fuckin Hackmann, kill a franchise whacked it, tired of him saying it didn't happen
[1:00:43] <+aslfrasle> @heartlesshealer As someone who played it for a bit, gacha ff tactics is the worst nightmare.
[1:00:46] <+ZoltanBMagnus> @heartlesshealer Honestly not that bad for gacha standards. Little grindy but the "rarity" of units doesn't really matter much
[1:00:49] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[1:00:54] <ShichiNoBushi> It's good to like things. Unless those things are trash.
[1:01:08] <MoonObscure> LOOOOOOOOOOOL

[1:01:15] <knowyourenemy_97> Ok.
[1:01:16] <%Zombrocom> Sitting at 600 hours in warhammer now, it's fantastic LUL
[1:01:17] <%heartlesshealer> I will avoid it, but as long as the rarity genuinely doesn't matter, then fine if people are into it
[1:01:21] <%optimasmaximas> paige is finally done reading about those jens she's been reading about for MONTHS
[1:01:28] <%GohanHitsugaya> LUL
[1:01:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> No
[1:01:32] <%JonathLP> Have you thought of starting an OnlyFans to subsidize your N-pass plus?
[1:01:34] <+itslunchie> Eh fair point. I guess i don't know enough about the cordeceps to know for sure but if they HAD to kill 25 people to just attempt to make a anti-virus/cure I imagine that was the only way they could get it, at least with their diminished means
[1:01:35] <%CalderGaming> that's the right answer
[1:01:35] <@commanderclaw> @woolieversus
[1:01:37] <%optimasmaximas> i have the link to woolie's en pass @PatStaresAt send them my way
[1:01:38] <+Kairi__> That website is awesome ngl
[1:01:42] <+BKNPham> GO TO THE WEBSITE
[1:01:42] <cellularmishap> Paige can read? since when? also hi
[1:01:44] <%ahdurian> probably going to charge full price
[1:01:45] <+meatmaaan> the last of 2 really makes you feel like your the last person playing this game
[1:01:48] <NiktenKing> BROWN PRORATE
[1:01:50] <%TaterBurglar> 1, Victory and Defeat titles mean NOTHING, all that matters is victory good, defeat bad. Phyrric, Valiant, those adjectives are meaningless. The reason armies are able to retreat is because some of them were able to flee the field of battle. The army group will try to retreat and regain their strength. If you defeat them again, on the same turn, you'll wipe out the army group, destroying all units and killing/wounding the Lord.
[1:01:54] <iwa5h4ck3d> TOKYO MIRAGE SESSIONS
[1:01:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That website is indeed great
[1:01:55] <+itslunchie> I mean they probably had limited means in which to process shit due to most of society being fed by the end
[1:01:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> hey alright
[1:01:59] <%Meekest> But arent you an official sponsor and rep for his company

[1:02:38] <$MemnonV> I bought Warhammer 2 on your recommend also. I played the shit out of the first one, but wasn't sure 2 would be different enough to justify the $$. So far I like it, but it did take some time to understand some new mechanics

[1:02:49] <@SoFarFetched> ZING
[1:02:55] <+itslunchie> i can't imagine they would kill 25 people immune to the disease unless they absolutely have to otherwise they are worse then some of the villians.

[1:04:50] <%YakumoYomi> Anime is "slang" Japanese.

[1:07:21] <%starotter70> Awww Yeaaaaah
[1:07:21] <%TalisKanju> @ZoltanBMagnus Thankfully, there were games that I discovered on the 3DS, but yeah it does hurt
[1:07:24] <thelonechris> Any skin from Warframe
[1:07:25] <%ultimatetotoro> which i guess explains why ff13 sold so well
[1:07:37] <+Kairi__> Bloodborne doesn't need a sequel but I would personally LOVE a sequel
[1:07:45] <Ell1ot> that sounds like the best purchase ever
[1:07:49] <%YakumoYomi> @optimasmaximas It's MHW DLC that turns the Handler into Mr. X
[1:07:51] <jkfd> little correction: watching kdramas is a pretty good and advisable way of learning Korean.
[1:07:58] <%starotter70> Give Vader a gun
[1:08:02] <%optimasmaximas> @YakumoYomi ohhhhh that's dope
[1:08:05] <derap41> Darth Vader saying I was such a shit
[1:08:06] <%dekkitout> If he killed more kids?
[1:08:07] <ElenaManetta> hahahaha
[1:08:10] <%briktal> nooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Hey Pat, just wondering if you're planning to finish Royal to completion on stream? I got a blocked recording notification and was wondering if you got a special go-ahead or something. Keep up the great work, pet the baby for me.

[1:08:43] <%kyh9> @ultimatetotoro Huh. I've only recently gotten into FF as a series so I'm curious how the pre-release hype was
[1:08:44] <MoonObscure> D:
[1:08:46] <derap41> He couldn't even kill his own kid he was always a bitch
[1:08:47] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> But he did become awesome. Just took a moment.
[1:08:48] <%Crimpson> Paige. He would say No to everyone in Chat
[1:08:48] <SilverFaustX> like a klingon
[1:08:48] <%Yautjabutts> answer wisely
[1:08:49] <$PadreHail> Like I said Darth Maul is almost the literal opposite and I can't think of any instance where Maul is bad
[1:08:50] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> he lost his wife
[1:08:50] <+meatmaaan> hmmmm burnt n crispy pat
[1:08:51] <themagic_conch> but pat isn't cool

[1:09:05] <%captainpodock> Darth Pat is 5'8"

[1:09:13] <%Crimpson> He would sulk for 1 day and move on
[1:09:14] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[1:09:14] <%dekkitout> Pat with bionics to be 6'5"+ would be a win

[1:09:23] <derap41> So scumbag
[1:09:23] <%cvp5127> " we we're engaged"
[1:09:24] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt @chat Has there been any character that went from shit baby to cool guy in a good way?
[1:09:25] <SilverFaustX> paige fell down for the last time
[1:09:25] <+itslunchie> Like legit if he was REAL sith he'd be like "F YEAH i can use this pain to fuel mah POWER" like Malgus did
[1:09:26] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> the prequels are just a silly awesome soap opera and i love it
[1:09:26] <%Zombrocom> Honestly, pat would likely shut himself into his room and be quiet and miserable for a bit
[1:09:30] <%logoth_> Crush mad puss
[1:09:30] <j0ustar> DAMN PAT
[1:09:30] <StromkoPenguin> It was so tragic when Paige tried to eat that truck full of mustard
[1:09:31] <MoonObscure> LUL
[1:09:31] <+meatmaaan> pat but his body is just all legs
[1:09:31] <%starotter70> GOD
[1:09:34] <ShichiNoBushi> It probably could have been better if he was instead put in some prototype suit that vaguely resembles Darth Vader's and implied he got upgraded as time went on.
[1:09:36] <ElenaManetta> LOL
[1:09:36] <%dekkitout> These strats are morbid
[1:09:37] <CriticKitten> LUL

[1:09:58] <derap41> Its just such a terrible thing to do
[1:09:58] <+gruff_gridof> 'fun idea'

[1:10:03] <bigtavious> Thanks Pat
[1:10:05] <%dekkitout> What is up with that?

[1:10:09] <%WhereIsWill> pat with the legendary strats
[1:10:09] <derap41> Tried and tested that one
[1:10:17] <%Jasuchin> I mean, that SORTA makes sense?

[1:10:18] <%CalderGaming> Katawa Shoujo but it's darth vader
[1:10:19] <ShichiNoBushi> Ex-married dudes.

[1:10:42] <+Vikingdeath1> Digital Devil Saga RULES
[1:10:46] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt That is like saying "She has a kid? That means she has put out before. I got a shot!"
[1:10:47] <%dekkitout> Eh? Imma need context
[1:10:50] <bendatron> the axiom is some bullshit
[1:10:50] <%Jeemukun> I understood that reference
[1:10:52] <%worldbrand> good job dr hawking
[1:10:53] <+necrognat> Hmm, this don't look like Persona 5...

[1:10:57] <Arek_1> @MemnonV LUL
[1:10:57] <iwa5h4ck3d> Hes trying
[1:11:01] <%Robot_Nixon_> ehh its fine
[1:11:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @dekkitout It's pretty much what it sounds like
[1:11:03] <%strugglepunk2> !uptime
[1:11:03] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 11m.
[1:11:06] <%Jasuchin> It's good
[1:11:10] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> LuL
[1:11:12] <%griffball13> its fine
[1:11:12] <%YakumoYomi> Have you heard the French version of Vader's "NOOOO!"? It sounds a lot less meme-y and more agonized.
[1:11:13] <%optimasmaximas> UM
[1:11:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I said good things
[1:11:13] <Orenjevel> its designed poorly as an MMO
[1:11:14] <%Zombrocom> He doing the bad talk for funsies
[1:11:14] <derap41> its not terrible
[1:11:14] <+SinisterBroccoli> I like it enough
[1:11:15] <+democrazyyy> the class stories are great
[1:11:18] <%Yautjabutts> It's free?
[1:11:18] <@ShockzNDrawe> I think its fun
[1:11:18] <%gespenst25> Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
[1:11:20] <ElenaManetta> pat means people he can trust
[1:11:22] <thelonechris> I've never played it so...
[1:11:24] <$KnivesEve> "its the best"
[1:11:25] <%strugglepunk2> I think Little V doesn't hate some of it?
[1:11:25] <%terminallyCapriciousz> It's FREE and the class stories are GREAT
[1:11:25] <+itslunchie> Kotor's great
[1:11:26] <%GohanHitsugaya> Digital Devil Saga is good, but random battles suck.
[1:11:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> @Moobot What game has he been playing for 1 hour?
[1:11:31] <%Zombrocom> I tried it, got bored around level 40
[1:11:31] <RetroCop87> why can't Star Wars fans just accept someone having a negative opinion of their franchise?
[1:11:32] <%scibren> Apparently it shits on KOTOR2's story
[1:11:33] <%Jasuchin> It's not a great MMO, but it's damn good Singleplayer
[1:11:36] <%Zulrez> there was a time where it was somewhat good, but then it went to shit
[1:11:37] <%linkster291> They kind of fixed it. MMO wise it's meh, but story with a group is pretty good.
[1:11:42] <ape_hawk> MAKE A LUCKY TED CHARACTER
[1:11:43] <%dekkitout> And that Ratslayer is gone
[1:11:44] <$thomassolorio> Cheer500 hey Pat just got that stimulus money take some bits and don't be suspicious 😉 just wanted to say l love yous guys I miss best friends play every day too you and the guy turned me on to all kinds of cool shows games and anime ever think of doing a 10 year reunion stream of the new preditor game or something any ways tell Paige her boots are cool and wag Elmo's bag for me well this party's getting crazy and I got to jet live long rock on and peace out homie
[1:11:45] <%lethallunacyx> I saw some people playing it, it looks like star wars WOW.
[1:11:46] <%Robot_Nixon_> good thing talk make fine point get across
[1:11:47] <Kraidn> You mean how everyone shits on RE 6, and for some reason, now think it's good, even though it's still shit?
[1:11:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Base game stories are good. Everything that comes with the Expansions are meh at best
[1:11:52] <%za7az> Welp LUL
[1:11:54] <%griffball13> @PatStaresAt why did you delete it if you said you were going back later
[1:11:54] <%optimasmaximas> oof
[1:11:55] <derap41> Paige could play it
[1:11:55] <%gespenst25> @PatStaresAt It's really not worth playing now, the only good part of it was the orignal story, due to level inflation the original story is now such a cake walk that it's not even fun to play.
[1:11:57] <%MelBrooksKA> So just cheat
[1:11:59] <+itslunchie> Not all star wars fans can't take criticism. Last Jedi was TRASH
[1:12:00] <bendatron> or hear me out
[1:12:02] <%dekkitout> Just cheat 4Head
[1:12:03] <bendatron> CHEAT
[1:12:04] <%MelBrooksKA> Or*

[1:13:41] <darcfowler1995> Don’t worry CD project read has some good shit coming
[1:13:49] <Arek_1> Backlog is getting larger and paralysis of choice is ever present.
[1:13:51] <%optimasmaximas> @PenmanLupine not really it's the start i was joking cause this what the stream is half the time lol (not complaining)
[1:13:53] <%Crimpson> Then go pee again and then end stream

[1:14:01] <ElenaManetta> the cartoon
[1:14:02] <$Afterman_> the cartoon
[1:14:04] <ElenaManetta> The CG cartoon
[1:14:05] <+Fenris_Alexius> THE CG ONE
[1:14:06] <%gespenst25> He didn't watch it LUL
[1:14:07] <%starotter70> Probably
[1:14:08] <%Arkfyre> "Well, all those dontations readins are done, that was a great stream, night everyone!"
[1:14:08] <%optimasmaximas> PEEPOPOOPOO PLEASE]
[1:14:08] <Kraidn> Because the cartoon writers did better?
[1:14:09] <FirearmsInstructor> @cureneckbeard shut up tho LUL

[1:14:10] <$Afterman_> 3d cartoon
[1:14:11] <%Jasuchin> CGI cartoon
[1:14:13] <%MelBrooksKA> yes
[1:14:13] <%MalekDracarus> 3d
[1:14:14] <ElenaManetta> yes
[1:14:15] <%Zombrocom> Probably cartoon
[1:14:16] <$PadreHail> The 3D one
[1:14:16] <%linkster291> CGI cartoon.
[1:14:17] <%dekkitout> Rex is cool, Maul is cool, Domino Squad is cool- end of review
[1:14:17] <%GohanHitsugaya> The crappy CGI one
[1:14:18] <CriticKitten> Eh, honestly he's still kinda weak in that too
[1:14:19] <%cvp5127> yes
[1:14:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Zombrocom Just the class missions? There's 3 chapters. First one is the longest with 5 planets. I think one planet can be around a few hours
[1:14:22] <%LaughingCatt> one has a 'The'
[1:14:22] <ElenaManetta> nooo
[1:14:27] <+adimcorner> one has THE and r he other doesn't
[1:14:28] <%gespenst25> I think one is Clone Wars and one is The Clone Wars?
[1:14:28] <%D00msDayDan> @PatStaresAt genndy's is clone wars, 3d one is THE clone wars
[1:14:28] <thelonechris> The Tartovsky one
[1:14:28] <ElenaManetta> the mid 2000's cartoon
[1:14:28] <zamzoph> One is Clone Wars and the other is THE Clone Wars
[1:14:28] <%optimasmaximas> @PatStaresAt cgi cartoon
[1:14:30] <%gynemaniac> gynemaniac subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! Here's some free money ya ginger biy
[1:14:31] <%Zombrocom> Anakin was barely in the old one
[1:14:32] <%ryome> ryome subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Cartoon with 3D models
[1:14:35] <%TheMattman1313> Gendy one or CG one is probably the best distinction
[1:14:36] <%GohanHitsugaya> Cuz CGI sucks
[1:14:36] <$MemnonV> this intro was almost as long as a PeachSaliva stream
[1:14:37] <+Fenris_Alexius> It's better
[1:14:40] <$Afterman_> you should watch the 3d one, its the best star wars has ever been
[1:14:41] <$PadreHail> The CG one is solid but has some filler
[1:14:42] <%Yautjabutts> but the cg one has darth maul as a robot spider!
[1:14:45] <Orenjevel> man, star wars is bad
[1:14:47] <%emperordread> Not Star Wars, that's too violent. Starguement
[1:14:48] <ShichiNoBushi> Cartoon Cartoons?
[1:14:48] <j0ustar> same here looks like ass to me
[1:14:52] <%LEMON_LIME_> CG one started shaky but got really fukin great
[1:14:55] <%cvp5127> is ahsoka a good poochie?
[1:15:00] <%Zombrocom> @Sphincter_Spelunker So what, 20 - 30 hours per class?
[1:15:04] <+Rickets89> where's poochy
[1:15:04] <ElenaManetta> I think people are getting up about Darth Vader because the show recently ended and he did something in the cartoon that people liked or something.
[1:15:04] <$Afterman_> ahsoka is great
[1:15:04] <FirearmsInstructor> Wait, people care(d) about star wars unironically? Really?
[1:15:05] <ThruLidlessEye> im about to be like that after rise of skywalker
[1:15:06] <$ThomasOfTroy> It was really good
[1:15:09] <%optimasmaximas> @PatStaresAt one is "THE clone wars" and the other is just "clone wars"
[1:15:10] <%dekkitout> Also Pat isn't allowed to enjoy Clone Wars cause of the prior movie, given his Vader logic
[1:15:12] <Arek_1> I remember the CG one being a snooze fest.
[1:15:14] <+Fenris_Alexius> DO IT YOU WHORE
[1:15:14] <Zayasu> cirSmug
[1:15:15] <Saltmeisterr> ashoka is great
[1:15:16] <+itslunchie> the cg one ifuriates me, because while it's good, it's like "Like legit, if this was ANY other series Dooku, Grevious, and Asaj would have been killed but we can't because they have to be in the 3rd movie shit"
[1:15:19] <j0ustar> PAAAAIGE!!
[1:15:22] <not_twitter_rowan> Oh my GOD PAIGE IS A KONOSUBA GIRL
[1:15:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> :)
[1:15:26] <Kraidn> The CGI series is a grind for the first 4 seasons. Very difficult cringe to deal with. But otherwise gets better after that
[1:15:28] <%ssjklyco> They look like garbage
[1:15:31] <%optimasmaximas> CLONE WARS IS THE GREATEST THING IN STAR WARS
[1:15:32] <%TheMattman1313> Pre-Stained shit I bet
[1:15:33] <ShichiNoBushi> Let's Watch stream.

[1:15:57] <derap41> You can not not show it now
[1:16:00] <+Fenris_Alexius> @PatStaresAt Paige would hate Konosuba because she would look at Aqua and hate her because it's way too close to home

[1:17:02] <j0ustar> I detest leopard print to all hell
[1:17:03] <%Ranryu692> anyone who wears leopard print immediately becomes a 75 year old hooker
[1:17:05] <%lemon_rinds> leopard print is trash neutral
[1:17:05] <+Capn_Trips> For the love of god someone draw Paige as Aqua with a bottle of mustard instead of booze

[1:17:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Zombrocom One thing to note. The Agent has callouts to other class stories and is also one of the best. So, take that as you will
[1:17:33] <%YakumoYomi> There's nothing "neutral" about Leopard Print.
[1:17:33] <j0ustar> Leopard print needs to be banned from life

[2:18:09] <%MonsterEnvy> @agilesalmon I never said it was not evil. But Admiring someone as your father for 13 years, can make wholy hating them even if they are horrible hard.

[2:19:05] <+Kairi__> If Joker was a grown adult, Tameki would of been my romance choice
[2:19:06] <+MrAtheGreat> @patstaresat Reminder to always pick up an imported protein at the end of the month for big late game gains.
[2:19:07] <knowyourenemy_97> I'll buy Royal when sales roll around. In the mean time, I'll replay P5 vanilla later
[2:19:09] <%MagicBeanBurrito> She's some kind of super doctor
[2:19:10] <+Coolkevinator> it's fine, rank 7 death is a huge roadblock for a few months
[2:19:12] <wookie5358> I'd say normally it would be around 150-160
[2:19:28] <teflonbilly777> @Kairi__ This game has the best cake
[2:19:37] <SonicD4> my cat scream what happun

[2:30:13] <%Jasuchin> Being good at billiards is super helpful
[2:30:14] <+Coolkevinator> @PatStaresAt getting ranks in billiards increases your technical damage, you need the items to rank up
[2:30:16] <$Wafflum> You need them for each "stage" of billiards
[2:30:23] <omen_setter> it's insane how useful this game's soundtrack is for working on shit
[2:30:27] <supermightygplays> billiards = more technical damage
[2:30:27] <%WanderingSwordsman> increases your tech rank when you do billards
[2:30:28] <%Jasuchin> Awesome, you now have that cue stick forever

[2:43:42] <%coreyyotto> Lots of tiny dick jokes on today's stream
[2:43:46] <%Shwepie> @PatStaresAt Sweat is worse because they should be aware of their sweat and thus actively chose not to wipe before shaking. Limpsters are just bad at shaking.

[4:27:04] <%zyberion626> but she needs to run the inn
[4:27:05] <%Taengoo31> but she doesnt have the humor like yukiko
[4:27:05] <%starotter70> Drunk washed out Yukiko
[4:27:07] <Zerud> @Bane_Kaikyo yukiko from persona 4
[4:27:09] <$thesickestzak> Persona starts at 5
[4:27:09] <redrins> ohya is fine
[4:27:10] <%Zombrocom> That makes no sense
[4:27:10] <wookie5358> Fell on hard times
[4:27:11] <JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> have her confidant powers not be garbage
[4:27:12] <%weissguard> But Yukiko was a different Arcana. How would you explain the switch?
[4:27:15] <Warbot40> That raises soooo many questions if that happened
[4:27:16] <%TalisKanju> How would Joker know that
[4:27:18] <%D00msDayDan> new headcanon
[4:27:21] <%Zulrez> would be hilarious in q2 when you meet her LUL
[4:27:22] <%NitronStreams> Persona starts at 6
[4:27:22] <+Coolkevinator> she kinda looks like Yukiko a bit tbh
[4:27:24] <robotlunatic> that'd rule
[4:27:25] <%Jasuchin> Maybe make her even more in on the whole Phantom Thieves deal, as she's another Persona user
[4:27:29] <wrydiculous> ahh shit, she's shit-faced
[4:27:30] <%HouseofNonsense> If anyone from P4 is gonna devolve into druken trash, it's Yosuke
[4:27:30] <%JaundiceJoestar> drunk 30 year old taking work advice from a high schooler
[4:27:31] <@SoFarFetched> Ohya vs Yukiko is pretty much Rei vs Asuka LUL given their VA's
[4:27:32] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt Lala is yukiko though
[4:27:34] <Huntercd> She's the best
[4:27:35] <+flillycake> Her concept art was so much better, idk why they scrapped it
[4:27:36] <%appletumtum> I don't really see how that fixes anything
[4:27:37] <%starotter70> @weissguard Maybe it can be based on their relationship to the mc
[4:27:38] <%Grayhammatter> we... did it
[4:27:43] <Balay123> Does she voice the fucking Get Smoked kid

[4:28:57] <%starotter70> @weissguard Yeah maybe
[4:28:57] <WhiteMamba1395> What a horrible scene in such a great game
[4:28:57] <%xcompleasedad> THE WORST BIT
[4:28:57] <$KnivesEve> wait wha
[4:28:58] <Thirtine> its marginally better this time
[4:29:00] <coldfire0007> Best girls
[4:29:01] <cipher758> oh man lol
[4:29:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL LUL LUL
[4:29:02] <%Meekest> TOTALLY BETTER GUYS
[4:29:03] <%JaundiceJoestar> like full on 2004 gay stereotypes
[4:29:04] <wrydiculous> They still kept this in Royal!?
[4:29:05] <%starotter70> I like this bersion better
[4:29:05] <%Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:29:05] <$Wafflum> JAPAN! barbCmon
[4:29:06] <%Jasuchin> It is actually better
[4:29:07] <LeBlanc233> he about to get swooped up
[4:29:07] <WhiteMamba1395> Pat please just skip this it's awful
[4:29:09] <%Lunaticbro > bye Ryuji
[4:29:09] <critfumble_> oh god this shits still in the game
[4:29:11] <%linSP> whats the DIFFERENCE
[4:29:12] <Wan6Saber> lolwtf
[4:29:13] <%mister___doctor> Fuck this part
[4:29:13] <supermightygplays> I heard rumors they were going to cut this from Royal localization
[4:29:15] <wookie5358> These guys get censored, but Lala is fine?
[4:29:18] <illtima> Even their gayradad is not good, since Joker is the one who's into crossdressing
[4:29:18] <+DorianCreed> Ryuji is literally the only person weirded out by this. Aside from chat.
[4:29:20] <%Typhaeon> hootz-pah
[4:29:20] <arkv01> this is why ryuji is garbo
[4:29:20] <%Crimpson> omg.. I just got why it is called Crossroads
[4:29:23] <wrydiculous> Lala is cool
[4:29:23] <%griffball13> @PatStaresAt there should have been an option saying I will dress up
[4:29:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Besides the massive 5head, headband short hair Ohya looked pretty good
[4:29:25] <SGrim> CHUT-spa?
[4:29:27] <%WanderingSwordsman> this change is still dumb
[4:29:28] <Balay123> Best friend?
[4:29:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> o no the gay evil LUL
[4:29:33] <%starotter70> So slightly less offensive
[4:29:33] <+OddityOn> Totally backfired against reeesetera LUL
[4:29:34] <%dekkitout> Can Joker get a dress too
[4:29:35] <%xcompleasedad> JAPAN IS VERY PROGRESSIVE IN SEXUAL EXPRESSION
[4:29:36] <%Meekest> Super not awful
[4:29:37] <$LuchaDePucha> hes gone now
[4:29:37] <$demegodz> Hmm
[4:29:38] <%GabeSweetMan> Ah so they change them to theater guys? It's marginally better.
[4:29:41] <%zyberion626> instead of implying sexual assault it's been changed to a misunderstanding about Ryuji being interested in the drag scene
[4:29:41] <Monkeyweed21> OH THOSE WACKY GAYS
[4:29:42] <%cvp5127> LUL
[4:29:42] <%topendbuzza> this change is much better'
[4:29:43] <wrydiculous> RIP Ryuji
[4:29:44] <+Coolkevinator> People got mad at that for being changed
[4:29:44] <%Grayhammatter> slighty less offensive
[4:29:45] <%JaundiceJoestar> gay people scary!
[4:29:46] <%spiritofmojave> that's not much better, it's still implying gay is evil abductionist shit LUL
[4:29:49] <bendatron> its better
[4:29:50] <Thirtine> ""marginally"" better
[4:29:52] <%Meekest> IT USED TO BE WORSE
[4:29:53] <SGrim> @OddityOn resetera backfires against itself.
[4:29:53] <%starotter70> Yup
[4:29:55] <%Typhaeon> People will still be babies about it
[4:29:56] <%linSP> HOW
[4:29:56] <+Mitchellsocks> I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with Lala
[4:29:56] <%GabeSweetMan> WAY WORSE
[4:29:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> rip ryuji's butthole
[4:29:58] <%korth367> F
[4:29:59] <wrydiculous> do elaborate pat
[4:30:00] <%ssjklyco> Why didnt Ryuji just leave
[4:30:01] <%Jasuchin> The censored version is BETTER
[4:30:02] <%weissguard> @starotter70 Wait, hang on a second. Arcana changing has happened. Adachi in P4G. There's something there after all. Possibly.
[4:30:02] <%zyberion626> Lala
[4:30:02] <Warbot40> marginally better
[4:30:03] <%spiritofmojave> it was worse before true
[4:30:04] <+OddityOn> @sgrim omega facts
[4:30:05] <%croxeye> it's still bad RIP Ryuji
[4:30:05] <+LandOfTheWay> i mean, it WAS worse. it's not great now, but still
[4:30:05] <$KnivesEve> how was the original
[4:30:07] <+Fenris_Alexius> What's wrong with Lala?
[4:30:08] <$thesickestzak> It's....better...
[4:30:13] <%Lunaticbro > Ryuji would kill it just like Cloud did
[4:30:13] <%starotter70> @weissguard Oh Yeah
[4:30:13] <+Kairi__> Ryuji is a minor. remember that
[4:30:14] <+Remery_> Ryuji liked it?
[4:30:14] <%zyberion626> Lala's fine. She's a drag queen
[4:30:16] <Lucasleonava> Nah , its funny
[4:30:17] <+OddityOn> Exactly
[4:30:18] <Joxardn> They were literally just predators before
[4:30:23] <%GabeSweetMan> "LOL SEXUAL ASSAULT IS FUNNY WHEN IT'S RYUJI"
[4:30:23] <LeBlanc233> dont to that
[4:30:27] <%WanderingSwordsman> not really
[4:30:31] <+LandOfTheWay> @KnivesEve the originaly was literally them dragging ryuji off to come on to him
[4:30:35] <%TheSniperJoe> Never been to Boys Town, huh Pat?
[4:30:37] <%Lunaticbro > taking him to the honeybee inn
[4:30:39] <$thesickestzak> Like Becky
[4:30:45] <Zerud> @GabeSweetMan I mean, it's kinda is...
[4:30:46] <+Fenris_Alexius> I still can't believe we just abandon Ryuji
[4:30:47] <$startadevy> itmejpREE factfulness
[4:30:48] <%mister___doctor> "Ryuji only came for us to make fun of gay people"
[4:30:49] <%WanderingSwordsman> it was a dumb gay joke just *shrugs*
[4:30:51] <SGrim> @GabeSweetMan also let's beat the shit out of him when he almost dies.
[4:30:52] <%starotter70> Yeaaaaaah

[4:31:32] <ImmaCanuck> Atlus you cowards.
[4:31:32] <coldfire0007> P6!

[4:31:38] <$LuchaDePucha> persona says gays are bad

[4:34:22] <Goldenwolf98> ATLUS LUL
[4:34:23] <+ProfCharlesX> what the hell is this game
[4:34:24] <%vectorless_peon> i think the people who made the biggest stink about that scene would just move the goalposts like they always do, but i agree jetting Joker get the D would still be a step in the right direction
[4:34:24] <%weissguard> No, that's the beach with Futaba event.

[4:34:36] <arkv01> fill ALL of ryujis holes
[4:34:40] <suikudo> that would be better honestly
[4:34:43] <theragergamer1177> It’s the beach in August
[4:34:43] <%JaundiceJoestar> it makes it not only homophobic but nonsensical
[4:34:44] <%nofestu2> THAT WOULD BE BETTER
[4:34:45] <Warfey> they have like no options limesLUL
[4:34:45] <%Shacklebox> Ryuji gets drawn into a gay orgy

[4:34:49] <WhiteMamba1395> is that not better than horrific stereotyping?

[4:35:30] <%WanderingSwordsman> or ignore it and move on
[4:35:31] <ElenaManetta> Thats the only English phrase they know
[4:35:31] <indig0bird> Be horribly bigoted and offensive or completely oblivious and participating in hiding the gays?
[4:35:32] <wookie5358> They'd be highly offended because americans would call them by their first name
[4:35:33] <bloody0t> it's a scheme
[4:35:33] <+MrAtheGreat> Oh wait that was Wednesday I need to get some sleep.

[4:39:23] <%TheSniperJoe> Nailbat, best of both worlds.
[4:39:25] <bloody0t> is this about Majima-san?
[4:39:25] <+AtlasMcCoy> Bat with a knife sticking out of it
[4:39:25] <shurtal> Depends on knife size
[4:39:26] <arkv01> knives for wilderness survival, bat for urban survival
[4:39:28] <+MrAtheGreat> Bat all the way.
[4:39:30] <SGrim> Thumping a skull is more satisfying than stabbing someone.
[4:39:32] <Littlecjmajor> but what about bat knife combo??
[4:39:35] <%GabeSweetMan> Bat can be modified to be stronger.
[4:39:35] <$LuchaDePucha> bowie knife?
[4:39:39] <knowyourenemy_97> Bat Gang
[4:39:40] <%GabeSweetMan> Always bat.
[4:39:40] <%nofestu2> bat
[4:39:42] <wookie5358> Stab a bag with a knife, then hit the bag with a bat. The answer is clear.
[4:39:42] <NeroInfinite> A machte is just a big knife pat
[4:39:43] <%Daniel_Is_I> I feel like a knife is more dangerous though
[4:39:47] <%Jekado> unga bunga
[4:39:49] <%ahdurian> Pat...was... durable?
[4:39:50] <%ElkRiverDog> How about a machete
[4:39:50] <%ssjklyco> You can block a bat though, you can't block a knife
[4:39:51] <%TheSniperJoe> You can live through a bat, a knife in the guy is the end of you.
[4:39:52] <arkv01> pat you were never durable...
[4:39:53] <%GabeSweetMan> Machete is a knife bat.
[4:39:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> bats have huge wind ups
[4:39:55] <bendatron> busting some kneecaps > just stabbing a dude
[4:39:58] <%spiritofmojave> Knife can cut arteries
[4:39:59] <%optimasmaximas> @ssjklyco that's wrong
[4:40:00] <%transporterthesequel> If they can tank the bat hit though you're dead.
[4:40:00] <%griffball13> depends on the knife
[4:40:03] <%topendbuzza> big windup on bat
[4:40:03] <+MrAtheGreat> A bat can do waaaaaaaay more damage than a knife can.
[4:40:03] <knowyourenemy_97> It's the range game!
[4:40:04] <$Wafflum> Knife is only the answer if you're a huge badass with a knife
[4:40:06] <%MisterRockett> *Uses knife to stab bat on your swing and disarm you*
[4:40:10] <%D00msDayDan> parry the bat with the knife
[4:40:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> This is very scientific
[4:40:11] <+Qsmash_> what if the knife is thrown?
[4:40:11] <%weissguard> Bat for sure. Home run those kneecaps.
[4:40:12] <bloody0t> maybe it's Mutually Assured Destruction?
[4:40:16] <%Daniel_Is_I> Knife hit is way more deadly than bat
[4:40:16] <wrydiculous> Why not both?
[4:40:16] <WhiteMamba1395> "they take the knife and become Majima"
[4:40:17] <%Jeemukun> KNIFEBAT
[4:40:18] <ElenaManetta> and then they have knife bat
[4:40:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> just be faster nerd
[4:40:18] <%Zombrocom> Tank the bat. Sacrifice one arm and shank em
[4:40:19] <KNWatcher> Knife get in close before bat swing
[4:40:20] <SGrim> Then they stab the knife through the bat and make super weapon.
[4:40:20] <%nofestu2> also it can crack your skull
[4:40:21] <wrydiculous> Majima made that work
[4:40:22] <l33tc4k3> hmmm really depends... knives are a shitty weapon for duels anyway
[4:40:23] <arkv01> also you can puts nails on your bat and limit break motherfuckers
[4:40:23] <%GabeSweetMan> FAIR
[4:40:25] <Khester824> You stab with knife not cut
[4:40:25] <%depressed_skeleton> Eat the body
[4:40:26] <+caffienatedjedi> Bat has the range advantage, but if you can close the distance then Knife wins
[4:40:27] <bloody0t> Stabber gets batted, while batter gets stabbed
[4:40:28] <%croxeye> fair
[4:40:32] <%starotter70> You can catch the bat in your free hand
[4:40:33] <%Jekado> never played knifeball?
[4:40:33] <wookie5358> And cops use tonfa for fighting. Not knife
[4:40:36] <ElenaManetta> cooking
[4:40:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> if you miss with bat swing, you're wide open
[4:40:37] <%Zombrocom> It's my cooking knife
[4:40:38] <bloody0t> concussion and stab
[4:40:39] <ElenaManetta> i have a big knife in my kitchen
[4:40:42] <%ssjklyco> I had to cut Dingos to keep them from eating the babies
[4:40:43] <%Ynkubus18> Knife for cake, duh
[4:40:46] <wrydiculous> Majima laughs in both bat and knife
[4:40:47] <%MelBrooksKA> Not in America spyCappa
[4:40:50] <%GohanHitsugaya> But you could wait until they swing, and then step on bat; and then stab stab.
[4:40:54] <%kyh9> It's just Crit vs DPS
[4:40:57] <%mister___doctor> So Ryuji picked the better weapon
[4:41:03] <%Lunaticbro > knife is easier to explain. need it to cut things. no baseball right now so looks suspect
[4:41:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> twime pritch
[4:41:11] <%GohanHitsugaya> But I'm still team bat.
[4:41:12] <%nofestu2> holy shit
[4:41:13] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Katana are the baseball bats of knives
[4:41:17] <j0ustar> Endless Space 2 tomorrow woo!
[4:41:18] <%Typhaeon> Don't forget to sub with Twime Pritch
[4:41:18] <ShichiNoBushi> "I'm on my way to baseball practice." "There are no fields or batting cages in that direction."
[4:41:20] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> If they get you with the knife, you're done, but bat is better overall
[4:41:20] <arkv01> berry happy :) :)
[4:41:21] <jeffthesequel> Knife bat?
[4:41:22] <%Shacklebox> it was alright
