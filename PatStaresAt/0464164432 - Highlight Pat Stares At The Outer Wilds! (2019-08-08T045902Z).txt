[0:24:00] <Broooomy> why does pat act like hes drunk at all times
[0:24:02] <EuropanLamprey> Paige, Pat went Bald at 18, he was never young
[0:24:02] <@lewdskeletor13> Please Paige, Pat has never been young. He’s an eternal boomer
[0:24:03] <lotharrio> Men do live longer when coupled with women. But if it drives you to drink, I think it probably evens out.

[0:25:50] <%arcaderabbit48> Pat is the favorite of three. Think about that for a minute.
[0:25:51] <derekwst3> fallout
[0:25:54] <%waltzqueen> LUL
[0:25:56] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Randy's the biggest fail
[0:25:57] <@lewdskeletor13> Stadia
[0:25:58] <%SirGO0SE> Pat's really painted a picture of his Mom that just resembles Pat with but without the penis
[0:25:58] <%Estuko> LUL
[0:25:59] <+GutsofTeal> bet it eas the cheat box
[0:26:00] <EuropanLamprey> Stadia has already failed though
[0:26:02] <Louie_Salmon> Fallout was very entertaining
[0:26:05] <%salty_syd913> how is epic game store not on there
[0:26:06] <%ElenaManetta> I think Stadia because it costs so much fucking money

[0:26:15] <$OmegaWeltall> as someone who liked Anthem, fuck anthem
[0:26:15] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Wasn't fallout last year?
[0:26:17] <%arcaderabbit48> Stadia isnt out, but it has already failed. Its a stillborn concept
[0:26:17] <suikudo> Death stranding on the Epic store
[0:26:19] <+YabbaTroll> stadia is a going to be a slow fail
[0:26:22] <%SirGO0SE> Borderlands 3 implosion?
[0:26:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> The lack of Vergil in DMC5
[0:26:24] <%Deano8817> pokemon's a tipping point
[0:26:24] <%ElenaManetta> Pokemon can't bomb
[0:26:24] <%RupanSen> nah
[0:26:25] <@lewdskeletor13> Let’s be honest, Epic is the real failure here
[0:26:25] <%nmaten> hell no they made a bong pokemon
[0:26:27] <%ElenaManetta> Impossible.
[0:26:28] <%corepool> nah
[0:26:30] <%SirGO0SE> Pokemon is going to bomb
[0:26:31] <%skizzuto> pokemon's gonna do poorly by pokemon standards but it's still gonna make bank
[0:26:31] <aimlesshealer> I ain't buyin that shit.
[0:26:33] <+LastHazzerd> if it sells worse than Gen5 then it's a failure
[0:26:34] <DrFacilier> Yeah fallout was entertainingly bad but Anthem was just sad
[0:26:35] <Bearborg> pat is very wrong
[0:26:35] <%waltzqueen> pokemnon CANT fail
[0:26:36] <Finaldragoon> says someone who doesn't play Pokemon
[0:26:36] <Louie_Salmon> Pokemon already hit the worst of it
[0:26:40] <%GarbageQueenEllie> But Scottish waifus, dawg
[0:26:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I can't believe the bad team this time are just soccer hooligans. I love it
[0:26:41] <Ner234> Financially? Hell no.
[0:26:41] <%sshen> The rest will just come back in the gen4 remake
[0:26:43] <doggieo> That new Zigzagoon EVO IS DOPE THO
[0:26:43] <derekwst3> Pokémon looks like it will be fun, the new hamster looks fun
[0:26:46] <thetruenicster> I'd say EA, but that's been the case for a while now
[0:26:47] <%NWR_James> Guarantee Pokemon sells 5m+
[0:26:48] <EuropanLamprey> Pokemon can't fail and that's why it sucks
[0:26:51] <hassanico1> And yet you keep buying Epic games
[0:26:53] <JoeTierGod> Hoes Mad
[0:26:54] <+jcenderion> @AngriestPat Why does twitch ban naps but not VR-Chat?
[0:26:54] <Louie_Salmon> We know too much about Pokemon to get more angry about it
[0:26:54] <%arcaderabbit48> People make a big deal about the pokedex thing, but its really not going to be a failure. Everything they've shown off except for that has been pretty solid so far
[0:26:56] <+LastHazzerd> Fix the store and there's no problem
[0:26:56] <%averyoddjew> Shenmue 3?
[0:26:59] <+AWr00tBear> It’s too big to fail
[0:27:00] <%cvp5127> pokemon cant fail it can only disappoint
[0:27:00] <hassanico1> Maybe STOP BUYING THEM then

[0:53:23] <%ElenaManetta> But it's not a spoiler if you went to Dark Bramble! Unless you DIDN'T

[0:53:56] <mankeyfigh> IM IN
[0:54:00] <%Reveresao> ELENA NotLikeThis NotLikeThis WHY!
[0:54:01] <HeadsHeldHigh> Cause you're literally at the core of the planet
[0:54:03] <%arcaderabbit48> Is this game just one big metaphor for birth?
[0:54:04] <%Wynzler> This game looks sick
[0:54:05] <Youwereeatenbyalid> ...is that a BRAIN?
[0:54:05] <%arancet> @ElenaManetta i don't think "its not a spoiler if youve experienced it" is how it works
[0:54:06] <%GarbageQueenEllie> He's gonna touch the butt
[0:54:07] <+jcenderion> He has obtained 1 puzzle piece
[0:54:14] <%Lapinelis> ...I'm not sure I want to watch a stream of this
[0:54:16] <NickHatesSnow> It's okay Elena it was accident
[0:54:18] <arsonistdaria> this is where people angry masturbate
[0:54:21] <TimetodiveLTX> so there's plot progression?
[0:54:22] <hassanico1> oh my god Pat has still never landed on the twins
[0:54:23] <%SirGO0SE> Wooptydoo here comes the goo!
[0:54:25] <Youwereeatenbyalid> HEY Pod located
[0:54:41] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Anyone know how much of the game is left?
[0:54:48] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> It's okay Elena. I'm sure it was Queequeg's fault
[0:54:48] <+LastHazzerd> pffff, "on the other appendage"
[0:54:54] <Calek> @Youwereeatenbyalid a pretty good handful
[0:55:03] <jubejube56> Eye of the universe huh
[0:55:09] <%Frost_Quill> Gabbro.
[0:55:11] <itesket> gabbro
[0:55:13] <kane21601> chat should probably try to spoil less, but pat seems appreciative of a hint every now and then, he'd let us know if anyone goes too far
[0:55:16] <%Frost_Quill> And someone else.
[0:55:18] <itesket> feldspar maybe
[0:55:21] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Calek good, going to be playing this in a bit. Nice to know there's some left
[0:55:27] <scrashman> !uptime
[0:55:28] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 58m 29s.
[0:55:28] <gamewarden92> Gab-Bro
[0:55:36] <%cureneckbeard> no spoil space.
[0:55:37] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @kane21601 I agree. Not that I could spoil anyway, as I've never played this
[0:55:38] <%BioApple> problem is once you go too far it's too late
[0:55:47] <%Lapinelis> Sorry @AngriestPat , this is too cool for me to watch you play it
[0:55:47] <Calek> @Youwereeatenbyalid this game is pretty open ended, if you follow the right bread crumbs you can basically come here first
[0:55:51] <%arcaderabbit48> P R O B E
[0:56:10] <%Gray_skies1993> "slightly"
[0:56:12] <Broooomy> @kane21601 i have a feeling the pat's definition of too far is up to someone telling him how to beat the entire gaming and anything less is fair game
[0:56:16] <%ElenaManetta> When you see "kid writing" in this game and it's all messy spirals, I love that

[0:56:26] <%cureneckbeard> NO SPOIL space
[0:56:30] <+SammyOVision> Yes, but the breadcrumbs lead OFF this planet, somewhere else, to different threads first.
[0:56:31] <%Frost_Quill> Tell Paige about the warping time thing.
[0:56:43] <%ElenaManetta> Here is where you have to wait for the animation to see the text rings

[1:01:27] <Darmarock> Is it explained what the heck is this planet's core even is?
[1:01:27] <%ElenaManetta> There's a meditate option?
[1:01:28] <%GarbageQueenEllie> The Pink Guy Technique
[1:01:31] <%ElenaManetta> I've just been killing myself.
[1:01:37] <atravelbee> where do you learn to meditate? i missed the last stream
[1:01:38] <%Frost_Quill> @ElenaManetta He got it from Gabbro.
[1:01:40] <Calek> talk to grabbo @ElenaManetta
[1:01:40] <%foreverN2dust> I'm late, did he find out how to get past the electricity?
[1:01:41] <%Gray_skies1993> @ElenaManetta you get it from talking to Gabbro
[1:01:41] <%cureneckbeard> He died somehow!
[1:01:41] <%Reveresao> genius......
[1:01:42] <HeadsHeldHigh> the core of the planet is just a huge mass of dead coral, at least thats what it looks like
[1:01:44] <%Reveresao> sure
[1:01:45] <%NeoTox> @AngriestPat Thank you to you and woolie for talking about this game on the podcast. I got it and it's one of my favorite games I've played in awhile.
[1:01:45] <%ElenaManetta> o
[1:01:46] <%Mornaka> @ElenaManetta gabbro teaches you
[1:01:48] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Wait. HOW'd it get BELOW THE EM BARRIER?
[1:01:49] <$Sir_stride> how many bites the dust jokes have there been?
[1:01:49] <+peppament> did I miss ff7
[1:01:52] <Bearborg> @atravelbee talk to gabbro
[1:01:53] <hassanico1> @foreverN2dust yes
[1:01:54] <%skizzuto> @foreverN2dust yes
[1:01:59] <%galaxyswirl> @foreverN2dust no
[1:02:01] <+timblenaut> it's clearly a ball-in-slot puzzle
[1:02:01] <$Sir_stride> @peppament hes playing it tomorrow
[1:02:01] <%ElenaManetta> I just wonder why we can't use the translator on the coordinates
[1:02:02] <%ShichiNoBushi> Is that what that blue thing lauching at the beginning of the loop is?
[1:02:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Youwereeatenbyalid do you want a spoiler?
[1:02:03] <%bakiinthedemon> Where hasn't he been so far?
[1:02:03] <alrobot2014> @peppament there was no ff7 today
[1:02:06] <%GarbageNirvana> So is that what keeps firing every time you wake up?
[1:02:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> @youwereeatenbyalid Fell from space at absurd speed
[1:02:10] <Combat_Data> Pat, then why are they long dead but it's still firing?
[1:02:12] <Storm_Samurai> @AngriestPat If you want you can actually chase down the orbital probe in your ship it's hard though
[1:02:12] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @doc_ock_rokc actually no.
[1:02:12] <%Gray_skies1993> ah yes, the barrier of all living things, language
[1:02:21] <+peppament> @alrobot2014 ahh okay thanks
[1:02:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Youwereeatenbyalid okay just echecking
[1:02:24] <%Frost_Quill> Dark Bramble?

[1:02:38] <LodiFrostbeard> YEAH
[1:02:38] <$Mendin> What about The Eye?
[1:02:38] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm like super interested but at the same time I'm worried about spoiling too much for myself cause I kinda wanna play this myself
[1:02:39] <%RubberFistFight> Oh hahaha this is gonna be greeeaaaattt
[1:02:41] <%starotter70> this reminds me of all the places you can go to in Riven
[1:02:41] <Treuan> Awww yeah
[1:02:41] <zedravan> yeyeye
[1:02:41] <+LastHazzerd> "Bramble Blast starts playing"
[1:02:42] <Futurecity10> What about the enterloper?
[1:02:44] <Tisaric> oh hell yeah
[1:02:44] <Calek> oh no Dark Bramble ;_;
[1:02:47] <hassanico1> ...what? What about the eye?!
[1:02:47] <%GarbageNirvana> But then I'm also super broke so idk when I'm gonna get to play it
[1:02:51] <+Maximum_KIX> Fuck dark bramble
[1:02:51] <%ElenaManetta> Hahahaha... Dark Bramble gives you the solution to Giant's Deep, BUT ALSO _____
[1:02:55] <Storm_Samurai> Dark Bramble BibleThump
[1:02:56] <$Mendin> is The Eye on t he map now?
[1:02:57] <hassanico1> Also Woolie went here FIRST
[1:03:00] <Tisaric> you've got the interloper as well
[1:03:00] <Ion_Laser> SPACE
[1:03:01] <%Frost_Quill> Yeyeye I've been looking forward to this. This is the only thing I got spoiled on.
[1:03:01] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @LastHazzerd if you are tralking about the DK2 music, you are correct.
[1:03:02] <JumbleJams> bramble YEE
[1:03:04] <%dalmek> @angriestpat don't forget the interloper
[1:03:07] <%waltzqueen> night time
[1:03:09] <+LastHazzerd> yes
[1:03:09] <HarraceHarrison> Because it's night time all the time out here
[1:03:09] <+AWr00tBear> First place Woolie went lol
[1:03:12] <Combat_Data> The game states from the start is that they are not here anymore and for a long time
[1:03:13] <%ElenaManetta> IS IT?
[1:03:14] <+j3tbl4ck3st> Interloper as well!
[1:03:15] <hntronium> @DemonicHoward Didn't he say he was going to Dark Bramble?
[1:03:15] <%RupanSen> the welcoming warmth of space
[1:03:18] <xeros720> look at all that Night
[1:03:20] <mankeyfigh> USELESS
[1:03:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> it would make sense that a person with vertigo would hate space
[1:03:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I don't blame you, Paige. It would probably break my brain to play this myself
[1:03:29] <JumbleJams> its night time
[1:03:37] <%segonian> night time start
[1:03:39] <+LastHazzerd> oh
[1:03:40] <%ElenaManetta> The speed of space in this game fucks with my head. It goes from so slow, to stupidly fast
[1:03:41] <hassanico1> Fun fact, Woolie went into this thing first
[1:03:42] <%Gray_skies1993> this place seems fucked. just a hunch
[1:03:45] <%MagickBurritoh> Dagobah
[1:03:45] <LodiFrostbeard> oh it is
[1:03:45] <xeros720> the vacuum of night

[1:03:56] <hntronium> Woolie died here really fast
[1:03:57] <+LastHazzerd> is it bigger on the inside?
[1:03:57] <+Maximum_KIX> “Planet” btw
[1:03:58] <Combat_Data> I certainly saved this for last
[1:03:59] <Treuan> You eventually catch on, how to match your own velocity needs to click but then it all makes sense
[1:04:01] <hntronium> He fucked up ad
[1:04:01] <%ElenaManetta> Yes
[1:04:02] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> it's Ego

[1:04:22] <transporterthesequel> Yeah it exploded out of a planet
[1:04:22] <JumbleJams> yes
[1:04:28] <%ElenaManetta> The interloper gets really close to every single planet, it travels stupidly fast

[1:07:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat didn't we get a hint about the fish earlier
[1:07:26] <HeadsHeldHigh> I can accept the sun blowing up if it gets rid of those things
[1:07:27] <MapleLeafTengu> I don't want to hear the status of other's grossness from the Mustard Queen.

[1:29:52] <%Gray_skies1993> it's tracking the major celestial bodies
[1:29:53] <DemonicHoward> maybe read the thing
[1:29:57] <%Reveresao> Pat: What's this thing? *walks right pass explaination*
[1:30:02] <IminyourBase> they each follow a celestial body
[1:30:03] <+LastHazzerd> OOOOOO that's so cool
[1:30:06] <+Grayhammatter> and the planets
[1:30:06] <KaseKaizer> crikIQ

[1:30:28] <HeadsHeldHigh> it's pretty neat
[1:30:35] <%Gray_skies1993> @cureneckbeard thank you that's the word I was looking for
[1:30:36] <NJigglypuff> this game is so cool
[1:30:38] <%Tennochief> control the moon?
[1:30:38] <%SirGO0SE> you are the fucking strongest
[1:30:39] <NJigglypuff> for real
[1:30:40] <+Scevda> EVERYTHING INTO THE SUN
[1:30:42] <%Tennochief> C-MOON
[1:30:43] <%SolverCODO> you can always just do that by looking away
[1:30:43] <%Reveresao> Kappa
[1:30:43] <deviljhojho94> Big brain tomatoBrain
[1:30:43] <Calek> well no not really
[1:30:45] <+Ell1ot> i mean... i guess that's kinda cool
[1:30:45] <HeadsHeldHigh> you still have to keep an eye on it
[1:30:49] <+BubbaRands> But the tides!!
[1:30:50] <+LastHazzerd> what happens to the picture you're lookin' at when you get in the ship
[1:30:53] <+OkamiDude15> well yes but no
[1:30:59] <DemonicHoward> @HeadsHeldHigh if you take a picture of it, it doesnt jump
[1:31:00] <%RubberFistFight> There's another trick, but you haven't found it yet.
[1:31:02] <alrobot2014> so to get the shrine to be at the north pole do you force it to be around a planet where yoy know its orientation will have the shrine on the north pole?
[1:31:07] <Dugy123> Just take a picture, moon stay, this just helps finding it
[1:31:10] <Combat_Data> He knows the Rule of Quantum Imaging
[1:31:10] <%GarbageQueenEllie> no. it's really boring
[1:31:20] <+Bluemanzee> Has he found that rule yet?
[1:31:21] <%ElenaManetta> i got hot dogs for space adventure
[1:31:24] <Dugy123> Yes
[1:31:34] <+timblenaut> MACRO
[1:31:35] <%ThePaperboy96> apatWrong
[1:31:37] <+Grayhammatter> macroscopic, not micro
[1:31:37] <Youwereeatenbyalid> *MACRO
[1:31:40] <InugamiTheHound> oh fuck I'm late today
[1:31:43] <%waltzqueen> MACRO
[1:31:43] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat MACROSCOPIC
[1:31:47] <HeadsHeldHigh> @DemonicHoward oh yeah i know, I was just mentioning that the tracker itself doesnt lock the moon's location
[1:31:48] <Dugy123> He knows the rule of quantum imaging and the sixth location
[1:31:51] <%RubberFistFight> Yeah guys just so the latecomers know - which of the rules has Pat discovered? I know he's got Imaging but whast about the others?
[1:31:53] <%SolverCODO> Viewing the map screen also causes the moon to jump, so you can fly straight to whatever planet you want it to be at and press TAB a couple times
[1:31:53] <Tisaric> IT'S SUCH A COOL SIGHT
[1:31:58] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat macroscopic
[1:32:03] <%SirGO0SE> @ElenaManetta give hotdog
[1:32:03] <%ShichiNoBushi> It is half of a binary planet sytem.
[1:32:06] <%ElenaManetta> NO
[1:32:07] <%Tennochief> For me, Pat's been streaming earlier lately
[1:32:08] <%BioApple> @RubberFistFight i don't know when he got sixth location but it's in the log
[1:32:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> What's the 6th location rule again?
[1:32:09] <MassConnect> mac cheese scopic?
[1:32:13] <%ElenaManetta> I wish we could just have a stop n shop base on the moon
[1:32:14] <Tisaric> I love the Twin planets and what it looks like just walking along them
[1:32:14] <LodiFrostbeard> you can jump fromm one twin to the other
[1:32:16] <pullman15> Go to the sun! What is that?
[1:32:17] <%SirGO0SE> k :(
[1:32:24] <DemonicHoward> pat you never used the sound gun, to look at this planet
[1:32:26] <Hydrapissed> HaL
[1:32:32] <hntronium> ye
[1:32:33] <aimlesshealer> Roast!
[1:32:34] <HeadsHeldHigh> its too fucking hot though
[1:32:37] <itesket> bonfire lit
[1:32:38] <%SirGO0SE> we need a space elevator dammit
[1:32:39] <%RubberFistFight> @GarbageQueenEllie the tower has to be at the moon's north pole to access the location. That's the rule.
[1:32:41] <+Scevda> Bonfire List
[1:32:44] <+Phalcore1141> roast it >:(
[1:32:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @RubberFistFight Right, ok. Thanks
[1:33:05] <SpellCatty> Bonfire List
[1:33:09] <%SirGO0SE> mr elon musk sir please do the space elevator so we can have a gift shop on the moon
[1:33:19] <@BigNaturalMan59> pat what is this game
[1:33:20] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Oh fuck the moon can be inside dark bramble
[1:33:28] <%Mornaka> OH SHIT
[1:33:29] <mankeyfigh> THE SECRET SIXTH LOCATION
[1:33:30] <+Bluemanzee> This game is space
[1:33:33] <%Tennochief> CREEEEED
[1:33:34] <@lewdskeletor13> NotLikeThis
[1:33:41] <InugamiTheHound> 6th chaos emerald?
[1:33:42] <+LastHazzerd> so get on the moon and some how get it to warp with you on it?
[1:33:42] <%manwithboxonhead> What is the main quest of the game?
[1:33:44] <+Maximum_KIX> @youwereeatenbyalid nah just around it that would be wild lmao
[1:33:46] <+Scevda> Just as planned
[1:33:46] <%Tennochief> I bet Creed is behind this
[1:33:47] <zargy> @AngriestPat can you ride the tracker as it moves around?
[1:33:47] <itesket> bramble
[1:33:49] <+OkamiDude15> @BigNaturalMan59 outer wilds not to be confused with outer worlds
[1:33:50] <EuropanLamprey> The sixth location: MODERN DAY?!
[1:33:51] <hntronium> dark bramble
[1:33:53] <+LastHazzerd> or find a way to teleport to it while it's elsewhere?
[1:33:57] <%cureneckbeard> The sixth location was inside us all along
[1:33:58] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Maximum_KIX that was my 6th location guess
[1:33:58] <%ElenaManetta> This game is really good at lining shit up with objects in orbit
[1:33:58] <Tisaric> This is No Man's Gone Home with a Majora's mask loop and every cool ass sci-fi trope put in it's universe
[1:34:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> brittle
[1:34:02] <hntronium> that one is brittle hollow
[1:34:03] <NJigglypuff> the 6th location is your butt
[1:34:03] <@lewdskeletor13> The Six Infinity Stones
[1:34:08] <NJigglypuff> i dont make the rules
[1:34:10] <Calek> that's brittle hollow
[1:34:15] <+edited156> You're mixing up Brittle Hollow and Dark Bramble
[1:34:22] <glaciusinfinite> brittle hollow pat
[1:34:32] <+OkamiDude15> cant wait to fight the quantum ranger on the quantum moon
[1:34:39] <%skizzuto> five is the twins

[1:37:43] <%RubberFistFight> god these two planets always make me so fucking anxious. The sun is RIGHT FUCKING THERE, it's literally like 2 meters away in the game's scale.
[1:37:53] <%SirGO0SE> i really want these people to be waiting at the eye just chilling and brewing a pot of tea
[1:38:11] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @RubberFistFight I'm eating. Grilled cheese with pesto. Cuz I'm a fancy bitch

[1:40:13] <+Grayhammatter> well, that's NO GOOD
[1:40:16] <+BubbaRands> looks dead
[1:40:17] <%SirGO0SE> itd be great if one of the messages was just a dude drawing a bunch of dicks. drawing dicks is great
[1:40:18] <%Tennochief> fug

[1:41:24] <+BubbaRands> @Dugy123 Would Paige fuck a vore skeleton?
[1:41:29] <%GarbageQueenEllie> is it grainy sand or soft sand?
[1:41:35] <gamewarden92> How do ya'll feel about being buried alive?
[1:41:38] <+LastHazzerd> does it fall?
[1:41:38] <Louie_Salmon> It's crazy that they had less tolerance for the sun than you, considering you're a fish person
[1:41:39] <transporterthesequel> It's totally a time limit
[1:41:41] <NJigglypuff> its rough and coarse
[1:41:42] <JumbleJams> oh no

[1:41:57] <alrobot2014> buried alive, eaten by the sun
[1:41:59] <MaeMae94> literally everywhere
[1:42:00] <itesket> The lore is getting buried
[1:42:00] <%SirGO0SE> i fucking hate sand
[1:42:00] <+QwertyThePie> @Louie_Salmon You're a fish person in a spacesuit
[1:42:01] <Tisaric> It's like they took every single cool ass sci-fi trope and made a planet or set of planets to showcase them
[1:42:02] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I'd prefer buried alive to drowning, not sure why
[1:42:04] <+Grayhammatter> good god, that's fast

[1:51:49] <+Scevda> Honestly though, this game is going to be fantastic for kids in the future
[1:51:56] <%averyoddjew> i mean ember twin
[1:51:59] <jou_star> smooth
[1:52:01] <%TeraMercier> Truly, is being under the effect of Bites The Dust a form of immortaility?
[1:52:04] <itesket> You dont need to go through here every time

[1:53:31] <%TeraMercier> If it was GER it would be more like him starting on a random planet
[1:53:34] <+SammyOVision> Immediately goes the wrong way.
[1:53:35] <%RubberFistFight> that was the rightest left I ever saw LUL

[1:54:14] <Louie_Salmon> PORT SIDE
[1:54:15] <+OkamiDude15> @negativejam not a fan of space and imminent death via the sun exploding?
[1:54:16] <%waltzqueen> that nervous energy
[1:54:17] <aimlesshealer> Gets directions; immediately disregards them in favor of stumbling around
[1:54:20] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Shouldn't some of this sand be turning into glass
[1:54:24] <+Sestren413> Is he deliberately trying to brute force it or is this legit confusion???
[1:54:25] <DemonicHoward> GG
[1:54:26] <%moogleboy1984> can you*feel* the claustrophobia?
[1:54:27] <+BubbaRands> Big anxiety
[1:54:30] <gamewarden92> did he go in a circle?
[1:54:32] <+TheSaintJohn> this is why you don't go cavin' without a rope
[1:54:33] <Louie_Salmon> Alright I have actually no clue where you are now
[1:54:33] <DemonicHoward> yep

[1:54:41] <Louie_Salmon> LUL
[1:54:42] <%waltzqueen> START OVER
[1:54:42] <negativejam> @OkamiDude15 it's more or less the isolation and the infinite silence of space where nothing cares for you, but close enough
[1:54:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GarbageQueenEllie why woulod it be turning into glass?
[1:54:44] <+OkamiDude15> stumbo
[1:54:45] <@BigNaturalMan59> baba is you
[1:54:46] <%RubberFistFight> @hellfirejefe it's one thing to be watching it, but playing this game puts you at BEST in a state of near-constant unease. Most people have a fair amount of dread for these places.
[1:54:47] <LodiFrostbeard> LOOK AT ROOF
[1:54:50] <%Ne1son> left patt
[1:54:51] <+Scevda> But how can this be
[1:54:52] <%ElenaManetta> He got to the city twice by accident, so I think he thinks he just has to memorize the maze
[1:54:54] <hntronium> Roof
[1:54:57] <LodiFrostbeard> LEFT AND THEN ROOF
[1:55:03] <+OkamiDude15> @negativejam i catch your drift
[1:55:04] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @doc_ock_rokc because of the rocket flares in your pack
[1:55:07] <%RubberFistFight> As a result you make really bad decisions and forget stuff you just saw/got told, because OH NO SAND or OH NO BLACK HOLE
[1:55:08] <Meekest> He did it

[1:55:23] <%starotter70> What'd I miss?
[1:55:24] <%moogleboy1984> the lack of ambient noise except for your breathing is intense
[1:55:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GarbageQueenEllie rock isn't that easy to melt it would need sustained heat
[1:55:34] <%Reveresao> if he accidentally finds the other thing I'm so done

[2:03:38] <%ElenaManetta> Look at the kid writing
[2:03:39] <%ElenaManetta> it's all sloppy
[2:03:41] <transporterthesequel> Crappy child writing is GREAT
[2:03:42] <%walternatorz> kids hand writing is messy
[2:03:45] <%Tennochief> dumb kids

[2:03:58] <mankeyfigh> KID WRITING IS SHIT
[2:03:58] <+QwertyThePie> There's a lot of child skeletons in this game, no time to notice them all
[2:04:00] <Tisaric> pogonaThink
[2:04:03] <Naoyin> littlefish is adorable
[2:04:09] <+Veenok> Sharks and Minnows

[2:04:19] <transporterthesequel> OH
[2:04:19] <%RupanSen> @RubberFistFight So this game is related to JoJo somehow
[2:04:22] <+gutlesscoward> Littlefish for evo WHEN
[2:04:22] <SoySocks> so it's like red light green light with sound
[2:04:23] <transporterthesequel> No ship light!
[2:04:25] <itesket> Turn off your headlights>
[2:04:26] <NeroInfinite> That's rad
[2:04:29] <mankeyfigh> UPPPPP
[2:04:29] <aimlesshealer> Neato burrito
[2:04:29] <%foreverN2dust> sipsipSipsipblind
[2:04:33] <+QwertyThePie> They're blind, why would headlights have any effect?
[2:04:34] <LodiFrostbeard> if you walk without rhythm you won't attract the fish
[2:04:35] <%skizzuto> so I guess just be quiet when near them?
[2:04:39] <Tisaric> good info to have
[2:04:39] <%dekkitout> Secondary Rule Change: D4C, so I can leave you dorks
[2:04:44] <+Grayhammatter> nice miss

[2:05:59] <Louie_Salmon> It was locked, if that makes you feel better.

[2:06:27] <+TheSaintJohn> sand works fast huh
[2:06:29] <negativejam> Time to goooooooo
[2:06:33] <%ElenaManetta> Thats how the kids died
[2:06:33] <%Estuko> Just let the sand carry you LUL
[2:06:38] <%Gray_skies1993> just go back out the top
[2:06:39] <%RubberFistFight> NAILED IT
[2:06:42] <%SirGO0SE> are they fresh? i hear the brain is the tastiest
[2:06:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SirGO0SE no theyve been dead for ages
[2:06:56] <+QwertyThePie> @SirGO0SE They died thousands of years ago, so no
[2:06:59] <+trackles_64> Did you finish Sinking City?
[2:07:04] <%TeraMercier> I'm always interested to see Pat's Log
[2:07:05] <Tisaric> isn't this storytelling and exploration just the fucking coolest
[2:07:08] <Psyramics> go check out ash twin, with all the sand on ember there might be stuff to see
[2:07:17] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @QwertyThePie hunter hunter reference, I think
[2:07:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sirgo0se Chimera Ants?
[2:07:30] <SleepyMaribo> how soon till the sun goes boom?
[2:07:35] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yeah I feel the game kinda undersells that "there's more to explore" thing for the Twins. You'll be here basically FOREVER.
[2:07:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You can just switch to another area, if you want. That sand looks like a tough boss
[2:07:37] <%SirGO0SE> @Sphincter_Spelunker @GeneralSCPatton i can always rely on you two
[2:07:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> Shoot a pod into the fish's mouth
[2:07:41] <%starotter70> Man that kid in HxH got it rough
[2:07:41] <Tisaric> sun's probably nearly boomed
[2:07:47] <JumbleJams> time for wallhuggin
[2:07:50] <Tisaric> yeah we're maybe 5 minutes max off
[2:07:53] <%salty_syd913> ohhhh
[2:07:55] <+Grayhammatter> that's NUTS
[2:08:02] <%ElenaManetta> Ash Twin looks so cool now
[2:08:02] <transporterthesequel> So no ship light and possibly no thrusters?
[2:08:04] <+QwertyThePie> It's a window
[2:08:05] <+Veenok> Well therrrrrrrres the Sand
[2:08:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> the eye
[2:08:08] <%AncelDeLambert> that's a reflector dish
[2:08:14] <LodiFrostbeard> @SleepyMaribo a few more minutes, but the sand is gonna stop him from exploring any further this loop
[2:08:16] <Psyramics> they're blind, ship light doesnt matter
[2:08:17] <+Shaggnar> Some kind of reflectifying glass
[2:08:27] <%Reveresao> window
[2:08:27] <DemonicHoward> try the sound gun
[2:08:28] <+Grayhammatter> bu-why though
[2:08:29] <DRAGKUDO> a window?
[2:08:31] <godlesscruelty> space cult
[2:08:32] <+QwertyThePie> Why not?
[2:08:34] <+OkamiDude15> some kind of me roar
[2:08:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Shura pipi
[2:08:41] <+QwertyThePie> You don't have a picture of the eye of the universe embedded into some rock in your backyard?
[2:08:42] <+Sestren413> window. remember you can only look through glass one way in this game
[2:08:44] <%starotter70> oh
[2:08:52] <+Grayhammatter> gravity cannon sounds cool
[2:08:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> camp fire

[2:09:01] <transporterthesequel> Ash Twin Time?
[2:09:05] <%king_wragles> HUH, there was another ship
[2:09:05] <%SirGO0SE> is it like a reflector maybe?
[2:09:05] <%Mr_Pylon> Find the traveller that could be here?

[2:10:06] <+OkamiDude15> he remembers evo19MindBlown
[2:10:14] <Ner234> He's pretty about galaxy ending supernovas
[2:10:22] <+SammyOVision> Oh no, he's just watching all the stars die in the sky
[2:10:25] <%Frost_Quill> I think he's talking about different stars?
[2:10:28] <+QwertyThePie> He sees the other stars blow up
[2:10:28] <%decisivelynameless> If you look out, there are actually a lot of stars dying.
[2:10:31] <Tisaric> no he's just seeing different stars
[2:10:32] <+QwertyThePie> You can see them, too, if you look at the sky
[2:10:32] <+Grayhammatter> oh...
[2:10:33] <%SirGO0SE> not sure if helmet or egg for head...
[2:10:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> ALL OF THEM?

[2:10:48] <alrobot2014> oh god is it the end of the universe?
[2:10:49] <+SammyOVision> If you talk to him at various points in the cycle, his dialogue changes, like just now
[2:10:53] <%Estuko> OH GOD
[2:10:58] <+QwertyThePie> Poor Cherty
[2:10:59] <+Grayhammatter> uh...

[2:11:23] <itesket> Boomer stars
[2:11:24] <+Tarkara> Wait is that why everythigns so close? because the universe is crunching?
[2:11:30] <tanarath> Didn't they say that they're powering the project in a way that isn't ethical?
[2:11:30] <%starotter70> Oh dear
[2:11:30] <cjsugar> this was the first place Woolie went ^^
[2:11:31] <cache_22> Chert is space Pat, right?
[2:11:31] <mrvidicus> Just came back. I see the nightmare fuel is getting even harder.
[2:11:31] <gamewarden92> Chert has let it set in
[2:11:32] <Ner234> Existential crisis
[2:11:33] <mankeyfigh> DID YOU KNOW EVERYONE GOES CRAZY LIKE THIS
[2:11:36] <+akuda_bar> this guy is basically pat
[2:11:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> you got here right before he started panicing
[2:11:38] <transporterthesequel> You're too late
[2:11:39] <%starotter70> WASTED
[2:11:40] <Psyramics> come here sooner
[2:11:41] <Tisaric> you need to get here earlier
[2:11:42] <%RubberFistFight> @Veenok dude just discovered the entire universe is dying. He's entitled to be nihilistic right now.
[2:11:44] <%Faustgesicht> Who's this?
[2:11:47] <mankeyfigh> COME BACK LATER
[2:11:47] <transporterthesequel> You gotta get to him earlier
[2:11:50] <+SammyOVision> It's too late in the cycle to get any useful info out of him
[2:11:51] <%SirGO0SE> and nothing else maaattteeerrrssss
[2:11:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Those damn goat-headed Collectors
[2:11:53] <$HyperionXV> Angry red sun
[2:11:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> Reset dialogue tree with the loop? Avoid it setting in?
[2:11:54] <@commanderclaw> Nervous breakdown it seems
[2:11:55] <%BioApple> oh shit that's a big sun now
[2:11:56] <NeroInfinite> THE SUN IS CLOSER
[2:11:58] <+OkamiDude15> BIG DEATH
[2:11:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> we can come back soon
[2:12:00] <%waltzqueen> BloodMoon fucked him up
[2:12:01] <alrobot2014> that sun is looking dangerously close
[2:12:04] <+Veenok> @RubberFistFight I know it's just, yikes
[2:12:05] <%ElenaManetta> But how is he also making the shakey sound on a drum
[2:12:08] <Louie_Salmon> On the bright side, this is the perfect time to explore the other twin
[2:12:09] <Dugy123> Different dialogue if your at the start or at the end of the loop
[2:12:09] <%king_wragles> CHECK OUT ASH TWIN FUCK
[2:12:09] <%SilvaChariot0133> Oh hey Sun
[2:12:10] <+Grayhammatter> time to go see the other one i guess?
[2:12:11] <%starotter70> Wrong ship
[2:12:15] <%king_wragles> You guys see that?!
[2:12:17] <+QwertyThePie> Getting a nice tan
[2:12:19] <%PanicSwytch> What did I miss
[2:12:20] <JumbleJams> you get to ask one (1) question per cycle i guess
[2:12:20] <mrvidicus> I genuinely don't think there's anything more horrifying than the heat death of the universe.
[2:12:21] <hntronium> Wow look at the other planet
[2:12:22] <PackysSportsBar> can you see what's happening to the other stars?
[2:12:22] <%Tennochief> wans't his ship on the ground?
[2:12:23] <%Gray_skies1993> sun ANGRY
[2:12:23] <%waltzqueen> crispy
[2:12:24] <itesket> Thats real red
[2:12:24] <mankeyfigh> GO LOOK AT THE COLUMN OF SAND
[2:12:25] <+Grayhammatter> that sun is getting LARGE
[2:12:26] <hellfirejefe> drumming until he dies what a champ
[2:12:26] <zargy> @AngriestPat stay and watch the supernova up close
[2:12:31] <%cureneckbeard> Teh Sun is your friend!
[2:12:31] <+Shaggnar> It ain't getting any less close
[2:12:33] <Tisaric> @JumbleJams nah he just got there too late
[2:12:34] <EuropanLamprey> Steal his ship, he aint using it
[2:12:39] <%ElenaManetta> He saw Ash Twin, he said "wow"
[2:12:42] <%Tennochief> surprisingly not buried
[2:12:42] <+SammyOVision> Time to outrun the supernova?
[2:12:44] <+Veenok> I HATE SAND
[2:12:51] <%SirGO0SE> @ElenaManetta and then he clap
[2:12:52] <%Cthulos> launch yourself at the 6th body
[2:12:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> REAL soon
[2:12:55] <Tisaric> it's nearly here
[2:13:01] <%dekkitout> Real close, in the splash zone
[2:13:02] <%starotter70> Would this game be more scary if the sun had sunglasses on?
[2:13:04] <%ElenaManetta> he clapped when he saw it
[2:13:05] <+SammyOVision> When the music starts you have 2 minutes left.
[2:13:07] <+OkamiDude15> its coarse and rough and it gets everywhere
[2:13:10] <Psyramics> not enough time to explore anything properly
[2:13:14] <NeroInfinite> loook at ash twin
[2:13:15] <hntronium> Is that the sun station?
[2:13:17] <%Cthulos> use a cannon to shoot yourself at the 6th
[2:13:18] <%Mr_Pylon> look at the other stars
[2:13:20] <+QwertyThePie> @SammyOVision 2 minutes max left, it can be less if you're close to the sun
[2:13:23] <+Grayhammatter> that's something....
[2:13:25] <%salty_syd913> what it do
[2:13:29] <%starotter70> huh
[2:13:29] <+Shaggnar> Dish rooIsee
[2:13:30] <+akuda_bar> @hntronium no it's ash twin
[2:13:34] <+Grayhammatter> what it do though?
[2:13:35] <%RubberFistFight> @hntronium no that's the other twin. They're called "Hourglass twins" and they periodically exchange sand.
[2:13:43] <%ElenaManetta> Stare at it
[2:13:43] <gamewarden92> Why is mr. sun so loud!?
[2:14:10] <+SammyOVision> @QwertyThePie Oh the song is exactly 2 minutes, the sun blows up at the end, you have a minimum 2 minutes, but not longer than 30 seconds extra
[2:14:17] <+Grayhammatter> oh, it's broken
[2:14:22] <%Gray_skies1993> door brok
[2:14:22] <%SirGO0SE> @gamewarden92 mogwai reference?
[2:14:22] <%arancet> a front row seat to the end of all things...
[2:14:22] <%Reveresao> @gamewarden92 he ate something bad
[2:14:22] <+hdawger> I may have to come back to this game. I played it for about an hour when it came out and gave up because it seemed to obtuse, plus made me nauseous.

[2:15:22] <DemonicHoward> man poor chert he let it sink in
[2:15:22] <EuropanLamprey> Roast a marshmallow with the supernova
[2:15:23] <ashuckel> the sands are a timer for the sun to blow up
[2:15:26] <itesket> thonk
[2:15:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> @gutlesscoward I am glad we both blame chert
[2:15:29] <%Gray_skies1993> this game is fucking awesome
[2:15:30] <+Grayhammatter> time ran out i guess
[2:15:33] <Dugy123> See you guys in 22 minutes ago
[2:15:33] <%galaxyswirl> You literally only have like a couple moments to explore the ash twin
[2:15:37] <%GarbageNirvana> Right, so all you gotta do is stop the sand
[2:15:38] <%Tennochief> *phew, phew phew, phew phew phew *
[2:15:39] <+AlMiRajGaming> Is it just me or did the dish point at the sun and the twin planet core at the same time just now durring the music?
[2:15:39] <%ElenaManetta> So by chat's logic, if we destroy the hourlgass twins, the sun never blows up
[2:15:43] <%SirGO0SE> churt just HAD TO PLAY a drum solo
[2:15:43] <+BubbaRands> boom
[2:15:46] <%Estuko> monkaS
[2:15:47] <%Tennochief> YES
[2:15:49] <%RubberFistFight> Oh good, O2 refilled, so you won't suffocate Kappa
[2:15:49] <%supersugoisenpai1> Rad
[2:15:50] <hntronium> pretty
[2:15:51] <+BubbaRands> pretty
[2:15:52] <3xgilly> Huh its like the twins are the timer
[2:15:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> PUNCH THE SUN!
[2:15:54] <NeroInfinite> woah
[2:15:58] <natebud> its fine
[2:15:58] <%MagickBurritoh> OH
[2:15:58] <+hdawger> monkaS
[2:16:00] <trueGarnish> sent
[2:16:01] <shevan123> cool as shit
[2:16:01] <LodiFrostbeard> pretty
[2:16:01] <Nina96> Kreygasm PogChamp
[2:16:01] <Tisaric> god it's so fucking cool
[2:16:01] <%cureneckbeard> Dump the paint!
[2:16:02] <+Virokwet> into da light
[2:16:03] <mrvidicus> Yeah uh FUCK THAT.
[2:16:03] <SoySocks> that was pretty
[2:16:03] <%waltzqueen> beautiful
[2:16:04] <%RupanSen> genkidama
[2:16:05] <%starotter70> hey my beds fixed
[2:16:05] <+Grayhammatter> pretty, and painful
[2:16:06] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> half as long, twice as bright
[2:16:06] <%GarbageQueenEllie> That was cool
[2:16:07] <Meekest> Oh my God the Twins are an Hourglass
[2:16:07] <+Veenok> THATS RAD
[2:16:08] <JumbleJams> PogChamp
[2:16:14] <SleepyMaribo> oh your right, the ash twins are the timer
[2:16:16] <ashuckel> the sands are a timer for the sun death
[2:16:21] <+OkamiDude15> @Meekest evo19MindBlown
[2:16:21] <+QwertyThePie> They're an hourglass
[2:16:21] <Jolly_Adventurer> For something so destructive, it sure is beautiful to look at
[2:16:30] <kane21601> god, supernova has to be, like, THE MOST painful way to die, right?
[2:16:31] <SleepyMaribo> this is game of the year
[2:16:33] <%galaxyswirl> HOLY SHIT THEY ARE
[2:16:33] <%king_wragles> There HAS to be something on the Ash Twin
[2:16:37] <%SirGO0SE> despite this being a story/explore game i dont think playing through with pat is going to stop me from buying this when it pops up on steam
[2:16:38] <LodiFrostbeard> @Jolly_Adventurer like my ex LUL
[2:16:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Meekest that is why timberherth museum calls them the hourglass twins
[2:16:42] <%Tennochief> probably
[2:16:43] <%Gray_skies1993> @kane21601 depending how quick it is
[2:16:44] <%NopeBadguy> @kane21601 You'll probably die pretty fast, I guess
[2:16:47] <salmarillion> Only way Brittle Hollow and the Twins work is because of the time loop. Great design.
[2:16:50] <%manwithboxonhead> Too bad this is an Epic exlusive game, now I am interested.
[2:16:51] <%sunny_side_up> sunny_side_up subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[2:16:52] <EuropanLamprey> @kane21601 Not really, it would be pretty instantaneous
[2:16:53] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @LodiFrostbeard *rimshot*
[2:16:53] <NeroInfinite> Supernova is actually the least painful way to die.
[2:16:56] <%Tennochief> that is if the ultra intense radiation doesn't kill you first
[2:16:58] <+Grayhammatter> to chet?
[2:16:58] <itesket> chat
[2:16:58] <LordScorp> I was afk in ffxiv and the shadowbringers intro played as soon as the sun exploded
[2:16:58] <garbageheaphound> chert
[2:17:00] <Jolly_Adventurer> @LodiFrostbeard ayyyyy
[2:17:02] <Delenay> it looked like there was a barrier on the planet that lost its sand
[2:17:04] <Louie_Salmon> Chort
[2:17:04] <%GarbageNirvana> You'd probably feel it for a microsecond before you were vaporized
[2:17:04] <transporterthesequel> There are lots of things on Ash Twin yeah, we could see it at the end
[2:17:05] <%SirGO0SE> chort
[2:17:07] <JumbleJams> damn you chert!
[2:17:12] <Louie_Salmon> Chode
[2:17:13] <+AlMiRajGaming> seriously, that dish pointed right in the sun while the ash planet was between the two.
[2:17:16] <Ner234> RAMMING SPEED
[2:17:18] <NeroInfinite> You'd just be vaporized before the heat even registered to yourbrain
[2:17:20] <%SirGO0SE> clort
[2:17:22] <EuropanLamprey> Chert! Why'd you kill the sun?
[2:17:22] <kami_baka_> It’s that point in a movie where the main character notices something important as he dies
[2:17:22] <Ion_Laser> ENGAGE
[2:17:27] <%RubberFistFight> @kane21601 nope. You'd get blown into a cloud of hot gas by the neutrino radiation alone - much less the ridiculous amount of EM spam coming out of it. You wouldn't feel a thing, basically.
[2:17:31] <Dugy123> Alright ODST troopers, we’re dropping into hell time to grow a pair
[2:17:35] <mrvidicus> Imagine a supernova happens, but you survive it long enough in a machine-heated probe to live for a few hours more as you watch the entire solar system freeze around you.
[2:17:35] <+gutlesscoward> we must kill chert before he kills our sun
[2:17:36] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Gotta join Chert’s drum circle before it’s too late!
[2:17:43] <+Grayhammatter> wow, that's a lot of sand
[2:17:43] <FunkyStreams> wow you just went as fast as an AK round just then
[2:17:45] <gamewarden92> Pat's getting better at driving.
[2:17:46] <%SirGO0SE> do hippie
[2:17:49] <%MagickBurritoh> Whoa
[2:17:56] <%SilvaChariot0133> lytFIRSTTRY
[2:17:57] <hntronium> nailed it
[2:18:04] <+Grayhammatter> big nailed
[2:18:06] <EuropanLamprey> Pat just crashed his ship beyond repair not even an hour ago
[2:18:06] <%Nobrev> so how is the sand leaving one and filling the other
[2:18:07] <%Gray_skies1993> @gamewarden92 he'll be bad at it again when he plays again next week
[2:18:08] <%Tennochief> no
[2:18:11] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Chet"
[2:18:22] <mrvidicus> Stop freaking out, he says. I'm sorry that it's SPACE Pat!
[2:18:28] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> obsooved
[2:18:29] <%AncelDeLambert> Hopefully by the time this is sold in a REAL store I'll have forgotten every bit of it
[2:18:31] <Tisaric> I never realized that he actually got progressively more freaked out, that's so cool
[2:18:48] <transporterthesequel> Quantum Moon totally goes inside Dark Bramble I know it
[2:18:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Dumbass doesn't realize he's in a time loop, even though he keeps vaporizing?
[2:18:54] <%RubberFistFight> @EuropanLamprey and then shot an ancient, priceless relic of a dead civilisation DIRECTLY into the surface of another planet, and said "oops"
[2:19:04] <%starotter70> he looks so small
[2:19:13] <+Grayhammatter> one to dead LUL
[2:19:13] <%RubberFistFight> @GeneralSCPatton no because he didn't interact with a statue
[2:19:16] <EuropanLamprey> Then got trapped behind the elevator
[2:19:17] <Darmarock> The most understandable freak out in videogames history
[2:19:19] <Tisaric> No one realizes they're in a time loop but you and one of the other explorers that saw a statue
[2:19:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> @rubberfistfight Oh, so there actually are tons of supernovae happening
[2:19:49] <+akuda_bar> @Tisaric spoilers??
[2:19:57] <%Estuko> monkaS
[2:19:58] <Dugy123> Oh boy are we gonna learn things?!?
[2:19:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> monkaS
[2:19:59] <%NopeBadguy> monkaS
[2:20:04] <+Grayhammatter> what am i looking at?
[2:20:08] <%GarbageNirvana> Honk rocks, eh
[2:20:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> these shards kinda look like rock poo
[2:20:09] <Tisaric> nah he met the Giant's Deep guy @akuda_bar
[2:20:11] <%ElenaManetta> I once had a rock spawn and clip into me
[2:20:11] <reonome> chert is so happy when hes not freaking out
[2:20:17] <MaeMae94> This part is preeeeetty neat
[2:20:21] <%Estuko> What the fuck is THAT that's some OBELISK type shit from... God, someone help me remember the movie name. something 2001
[2:20:30] <%dekkitout> You're looking at the magic rock, the Nomai used to ride these babies for parsecs Kappa
[2:20:36] <DRAGKUDO> gone
[2:20:38] <%RubberFistFight> @GeneralSCPatton Every star in this universe. It's this game's version of the Heat Death/maximum entropy. The loop is literally the last 22 minutes of existence.
[2:20:40] <%Estuko> NotLikeThis something space 2001
[2:20:42] <+Grayhammatter> uh WHAT
[2:20:45] <mrvidicus> 2001: A Space Oddysey. AKA Look at this money, the movie.
[2:20:46] <%salty_syd913> ???
[2:20:46] <%GarbageNirvana> This ain't a Marker is it
[2:20:48] <%averyoddjew> bye rock
[2:20:49] <%waltzqueen> wandering rock?
[2:20:50] <+Grayhammatter> where the FUCK did it go?
[2:20:51] <%starotter70> 2001 a space odyssy?
[2:20:52] <kane21601> @Estuko 2001 a space oddyseyt?
[2:20:54] <jaguarkek318> MONOLITH
[2:20:57] <gamewarden92> Will it telefrag you if you stand where it appears?
[2:21:02] <Tisaric> Quantum mechanics chat
[2:21:07] <Louie_Salmon> Wow there's a lot of chat that hasn't caught the other streams huh
[2:21:11] <%Estuko> @kane21601 Yes !
[2:21:12] <DrRyder> it's fine
[2:21:13] <%Estuko> <3
[2:21:16] <JumbleJams> if ya wanna have big anxiety, watch 2001 in a theatre
[2:21:21] <+LastHazzerd> this alien is so coordinated
[2:21:23] <imposivestar> Recall the rule of entaglement pat
[2:21:25] <glaciusinfinite> First time chat?
[2:21:25] <3xgilly> MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF SOUND
[2:21:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> @rubberfistfight Fuck, I thought the catastrophe was local, not universal.
[2:21:28] <%BioApple> I love that this planet is so small you can just glide your way around it
[2:21:31] <mrvidicus> This game is doing my big anxiety fine enough.
[2:21:31] <+akuda_bar> @imposivestar he doesn't know it.
[2:21:33] <DRAGKUDO> when it doubt go right
[2:21:34] <Scrub_Seeker> @gamewarden92 no, if you are standing where it is supposed to be you are technically constantly observing the space it is supposed to be in
[2:21:35] <+QwertyThePie> Oh sweet, they just put out an update for this game
[2:21:35] <%ArchimerDreatect> wow, there's a lot of chat trying to act big about watching more streams, huh?
[2:21:37] <+QwertyThePie> Just a couple minutes ago
[2:21:44] <%waltzqueen> pretty
[2:21:45] <imposivestar> @akuda_bar this is how you learn it shh
[2:21:50] <%salty_syd913> ooo pretty
[2:21:54] <glaciusinfinite> @imposivestar but he doesn't know that yet
[2:21:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Wouldn't it be funny if the eye of the universe just sends you back in time to the beginning of the universe, and then you end up being the first people?
[2:21:59] <+akuda_bar> what do you mean shh, you're the one spoiling it.
[2:22:01] <%Tennochief> sick
[2:22:06] <+Grayhammatter> oh hey, it's the rock
[2:22:07] <PackysSportsBar> @ArchimerDreatect more that there's some basic mechanics people are confused about
[2:22:07] <alrobot2014> is that the same rock?
[2:22:11] <imposivestar> recall the rule of entanglement
[2:22:15] <+QwertyThePie> Can we just not talk about things he hasn't found
[2:22:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> @garbagequeenellie Become Nomai
[2:22:17] <mrvidicus> Y'all remember that opening scene in Gravity, when Sandra bullock gets knocked into space and is going to keep floating until she runs out of oxygen? Fuck that scene.
[2:22:17] <aimlesshealer> @ArchimerDreatect wut LUL it's just a statement
[2:22:23] <+akuda_bar> @imposivestar no seriously why are you spamming a spoiler
[2:22:26] <3xgilly> Look at Pat threading these needles
[2:22:27] <%Estuko> FeelsGoodMan when Dwanyne The Rock Johnson comes to visit you through space/time movements
[2:22:38] <SoySocks> did he eat the rock
[2:22:42] <roofkie> can you kill things in this game?
[2:22:47] <%MagickBurritoh> he got quantum'd
[2:22:50] <mankeyfigh> QUANTUM PERSON
[2:22:51] <+akuda_bar> lmao "and I'm afraid of him" not quite
[2:22:51] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @roofkie just yourself
[2:22:51] <Nina96> he turned quantum?
[2:22:55] <Bearborg> time to hit the north pole
[2:22:55] <+Grayhammatter> that rock is nuts
[2:22:59] <InugamiTheHound> that rock have touched the quantum moon or have quantum moon parts in it?
[2:23:01] <%king_wragles> wait... can you close your eyes in this game?
[2:23:01] <%IDTheftVictim> You can kill through inaction I guess?
[2:23:02] <DagetStreams> I wonder if they want you to go to the north pole? Nah...
[2:23:03] <JumbleJams> the rock absorbed him
[2:23:04] <imposivestar> @akuda_bar i was trying to hint at it without spoiling it but if I'm spoiling it by just saying a phrase he knows then I'll stop lol
[2:23:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> he took a ...QUANTUM LEAP
[2:23:06] <gamewarden92> did he stand on the rock and turn his light out?
[2:23:06] <%king_wragles> I have an idea
[2:23:07] <glaciusinfinite> TO THE NORTH
[2:23:08] <+LastHazzerd> he leaped with some quantum qualities
[2:23:10] <ashuckel> he went quantumn himself
[2:23:10] <Louie_Salmon> @archimerdreatect I mean this game is a big mystery, so it's funny to see people freak out over what Pat has already figured out
[2:23:16] <Bearborg> red is north
[2:23:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> RED
[2:23:17] <+akuda_bar> @imposivestar he's seen the wall, you're telling him what he's about to find out.
[2:23:18] <%dekkitout> Looks like he came down with a case of the Schrodinger's....

[2:23:49] <+SammyOVision> Chert SAID he's at the lake.
[2:23:51] <%sunny_side_up> monkaS
[2:23:54] <%king_wragles> @Tisaric UUUUGGGHHH, now I gotta wait for Pat to get it XD
[2:23:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Remember, the Union votes Republican
[2:23:56] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I think you explored both caves already
[2:24:00] <MaeMae94> too late, gotta go FAST
[2:24:01] <+twohitgood> red for north pole...think of the red on a magnet...because you're at magnetic north.
[2:24:07] <Dugy123> Red is north and blue is stop
[2:24:13] <%MagickBurritoh> too late, there's sand now
[2:24:16] <%Reveresao> gotta go fast
[2:24:17] <+gutlesscoward> baba is north
[2:24:17] <aimlesshealer> @Dugy123 NO
[2:24:18] <%Gray_skies1993> Baba is North
[2:24:20] <%corepool> too late
[2:24:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> Too late pat
[2:24:21] <hntronium> red means fast
[2:24:22] <+Shaggnar> Too much sand
[2:24:24] <+akuda_bar> this game is really not designed for scraping is it lol
[2:24:24] <kane21601> @RubberFistFight they mentioned one at the bottom of the lakebed, its just covered in sand
[2:24:25] <JumbleJams> too late
[2:24:26] <+Grayhammatter> i think you missed it
[2:24:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> sand is in there
[2:24:28] <%MagickBurritoh> It gets everywhere
[2:24:29] <itesket> You have to speedrun strats it
[2:24:30] <+MellowMute> No north pole, just sand
[2:24:31] <%waltzqueen> @Dugy123 underrated comment
[2:24:35] <PKLoveLucas> yeah. the bottom of the lakebed is already full of sand
[2:24:36] <MaeMae94> literally die and GO
[2:24:37] <+jcenderion> meditate and GO FAST
[2:24:37] <%Frost_Quill> Think of a blue stop sign.
[2:24:38] <%ElenaManetta> I was thinking of temperatures. The northern hemisphere is colder than the South.
[2:24:38] <%MagickBurritoh> you took a few minutes
[2:24:42] <hntronium> Wait just go on the other place
[2:24:45] <hntronium> rip
[2:24:46] <aimlesshealer> Aaarrrghhhhhhh not the stop signs
[2:24:46] <mankeyfigh> FAST
[2:24:47] <Tisaric> @king_wragles he should find it pretty soon, it's thankfully on the planet
[2:24:51] <%RubberFistFight> Become the Space Sonic you were always meant to be
[2:24:59] <+Sestren413> yes
[2:24:59] <$Gehtingsberg> Just go to ash twin next time
[2:25:00] <+gutlesscoward> outer wilds chert% speedrun lets go
[2:25:01] <%IDTheftVictim> whoa you have the ability to just sit and wait?
[2:25:07] <glaciusinfinite> pat becomes S P E E D
[2:25:09] <%PanicSwytch> Is there an end to this game or is it just exploration? I've been enjoying Pat's playthrough, I'm not trying to rush things.
[2:25:11] <mankeyfigh> YOU NEED TO AN INVESTIGATION, LITERALLY FROM BOTTOM TO TOP
[2:25:12] <Tisaric> they added the ability to wait
[2:25:18] <Tisaric> which would've been nice
[2:25:20] <Calek> there's an end eventually
[2:25:22] <%RubberFistFight> @PanicSwytch there is an end, yes
[2:25:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @IDTheftVictim you get it on giants deap...have fun
[2:25:23] <%Reveresao> @PanicSwytch multiple endings
[2:25:25] <roofkie> can you build things in this or is it only exploration
[2:25:26] <LodiFrostbeard> @IDTheftVictim you get that from talking to the guy in giant's deep
[2:25:26] <zedravan> remember north is the best place for signal so they camp there
[2:25:29] <%starotter70> Pat, you have to find the Alpha Gamerpad
[2:25:31] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It should've been a Give Up on Life button
[2:25:31] <Calek> only exploration
[2:25:32] <%ElenaManetta> I talked to the big dummy on Giant's Deep, too, he never gave me no ability to wait
[2:25:36] <%Estuko> @roofkie exploration
[2:25:44] <%dalmek> Pat got the DIE ending his very first run
[2:25:44] <+Grayhammatter> oh god
[2:25:44] <Dugy123> @idtheftvictim Talking to Gabbro after dying, he teaches you to chill and that restarts the loop
[2:25:49] <+akuda_bar> @ElenaManetta you have to talk to him on a subsequent life iirc
[2:25:50] <Louie_Salmon> @elenamanetta I think on magnets/compasses it's conventional to mark North as red and south as blue, for whatever reason
[2:25:56] <itesket> thonk
[2:25:57] <%IDTheftVictim> I've only seen the game in streams, it's got the Epic Store exclusive thing right?
[2:26:00] <%ElenaManetta> bwaaaa
[2:26:01] <%RubberFistFight> NAILED IT
[2:26:01] <roofkie> so whats the gimmick that makes it a good exploration game?
[2:26:03] <+gutlesscoward> just crash your ship into chert
[2:26:04] <%Reveresao> tree and run
[2:26:09] <Psyramics> Yes, its Epic exclusive
[2:26:11] <Tisaric> @IDTheftVictim unfortunately exclusive yeah
[2:26:14] <%PanicSwytch> apatGib
[2:26:16] <Louie_Salmon> @elenamanetta Yeah it's gotta be twice, on two different runs
[2:26:16] <%Reveresao> on xbox too

[2:26:26] <%RubberFistFight> @roofkie the worldbuilding and the mystery of the 22 minute loop
[2:26:27] <%BioApple> @roofkie the planets all have weird geography that makes for good puzzles
[2:26:28] <%IDTheftVictim> I got Playstation
[2:26:33] <+Grayhammatter> crash into chert, for more time on the clock
[2:26:35] <InugamiTheHound> oh no deja vu?
[2:26:40] <%IDTheftVictim> apatPat
[2:26:44] <+OkamiDude15> do it you wont
[2:26:45] <itesket> You can but not that way
[2:26:46] <Louie_Salmon> @roofkie Good level design
[2:26:50] <+Sestren413> Why, as the bigger hearthean, does pat not simply consume chert?
[2:26:50] <+AlMiRajGaming> EJECT BUTTON!
[2:26:55] <%Estuko> @roofkie there's ACTUAL stuff to look for and solve/discovery. a properly done "explore space to your pleasure!" kinda game lol
[2:26:57] <+akuda_bar> deja vu i've just been in this place before higher on the street and i know it's my time to go
[2:26:57] <JumbleJams> just fall out
[2:26:58] <Dugy123> Throw chert into the sun for more time on the clock
[2:27:00] <+jcenderion> GO GO GO
[2:27:01] <$NS120> cheer500 Have some bits Pat, also thanks to you, Peach and Elmo for being great and giving me something to relax to when i'm stressed out
[2:27:02] <%PanicSwytch> Do it u coward
[2:27:05] <+Bluemanzee> @roofkie Mystery game
[2:27:09] <Tisaric> smart level, puzzle, and breadcrumb design reall makes this game special
[2:27:14] <trueGarnish> monkaS
[2:27:16] <%starotter70> Oh boy
[2:27:18] <%MagickBurritoh> Oh shit
[2:27:20] <+Bluemanzee> Gotta find the mystery
[2:27:21] <+gutlesscoward> chert's youthful energy will delay your inevitable demise
[2:27:25] <mrvidicus> Up is down and down is up
[2:27:27] <+Grayhammatter> can't see nothing cap'n
[2:27:27] <MaeMae94> Maze time!
[2:27:29] <itesket> No fear just run
[2:27:29] <Dugy123> Who’s ready for some learning?!
[2:27:30] <imposivestar> jump on cherts head for an extra life
[2:27:31] <%GarbageQueenEllie> run hendar run!
[2:27:32] <roofkie> cool i guess
[2:27:33] <DemonicHoward> man this place is hard
[2:27:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> almost there
[2:27:40] <mrvidicus> Chert, get in the robot!
[2:27:41] <gamewarden92> It's like a metroidvania, but all the powerups are knowledge.
[2:27:44] <%MagickBurritoh> Hall Wugg
[2:27:44] <%ShichiNoBushi> The rock emitted a signal.
[2:27:46] <DemonicHoward> i meant dark

[2:27:52] <+emperri> nawlidge
[2:27:56] <%sunny_side_up> this is a nightmare maze and i dont like it one bit
[2:27:57] <%Estuko> I keep thinking Chat's trying to say Cher, the singer fucking blew up the planet lmfao
[2:27:59] <imposivestar> OH BOY
[2:27:59] <DemonicHoward> try sound gun to find rock
[2:28:06] <Tisaric> this is such a cool discovery as well
[2:28:06] <MassConnect> how much content does this game have? 3 years?
[2:28:13] <JumbleJams> use sound
[2:28:14] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Cher is timeless. She's a vampire
[2:28:18] <glaciusinfinite> PAT SIGNALSCOPE
[2:28:18] <itesket> NotLikeThis
[2:28:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Estuko Do you BELIEVE in life after space?
[2:28:19] <%MagickBurritoh> oh no
[2:28:23] <+Grayhammatter> welp
[2:28:26] <Tisaric> it's like an 8 hour game
[2:28:27] <+Shaggnar> LUL
[2:28:27] <%dekkitout> Saaaaaand!
[2:28:29] <Thalchampz> ohnooooooo
[2:28:36] <+akuda_bar> it's coarse and it gets everywhere
[2:28:37] <%corepool> defeated by sand
[2:28:37] <Thalchampz> it's fine
[2:28:38] <%starotter70> I hate it
[2:28:43] <+waterbuddy16> you can use probe for light
[2:28:43] <+QwertyThePie> @MassConnect According to How Long to Beat, average is 17h for the main story and closer to 19 hours for completionists
[2:28:45] <%Estuko> @GarbageQueenEllie Never leave us
[2:28:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> t
[2:28:47] <%Reveresao> use light!!
[2:28:50] <DemonicHoward> not that one
[2:28:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> use your scope
[2:28:53] <Dugy123> It’s in this and
[2:28:57] <%Reveresao> @AngriestPat use light
[2:28:58] <Tisaric> oh wow did I underestimate it's length
[2:29:03] <+QwertyThePie> But a lot of people get closer to 12 hours
[2:29:09] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Tisaric that's what she said
[2:29:10] <%Nobrev> that was the moon not the rock i think
[2:29:12] <itesket> dont look for the moon
[2:29:16] <+Grayhammatter> uh huh
[2:29:18] <+QwertyThePie> I think the average there is probably skewed because one person got a super-high time, it used to be 12 hours
[2:29:21] <%RubberFistFight> @QwertyThePie it's actually solvable in 1 loop if you already know what to do.
[2:29:26] <+Grayhammatter> oh boy
[2:29:29] <+QwertyThePie> @RubberFistFight I know. I do any% runs.
[2:29:35] <VoiceActingNinja> Yo @AngriestPat it's Lucas! How's the game going?
[2:29:38] <+Grayhammatter> more maze
[2:29:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> its quantum
[2:29:42] <%sunny_side_up> quantum spikeballs monkaS
[2:29:43] <%starotter70> oh ufck
[2:29:43] <Delenay> quantum catuc
[2:29:44] <+QwertyThePie> I'm talking about the time it takes for someone to beat the game without magically already knowing exactly what to do.
[2:29:44] <gamewarden92> quantum maze!
[2:29:46] <PackysSportsBar> @Tisaric actually it's around 20 minutes long

[2:30:23] <+akuda_bar> didn't know you could take pix without launching the proble lol
[2:30:23] <%ElenaManetta> How do you even program in a quantum cave
[2:30:26] <+QwertyThePie> It might help to go in the direction that is opposite of the entrance
[2:30:26] <roofkie> why take pictures?
[2:30:26] <JumbleJams> right
[2:30:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> use signal scope to find direction

[2:30:45] <+Veenok> @ElenaManetta very carefully

[2:30:47] <%SirGO0SE> @ElenaManetta shockingly a lot easier than you think
[2:30:48] <hntronium> nailed it
[2:30:49] <%MagickBurritoh> This IS all of Paiges fears: space time limits, fish
[2:30:49] <+Bluemanzee> @roofkie Quantum objects won't move if you observe them
[2:31:01] <Louie_Salmon> @roofkie Makes it observed, quantumly locked, watch other streams for no spoils
[2:31:02] <+akuda_bar> q u a n t u m f u c k
[2:31:05] <imposivestar> @ElenaManetta just don't look at it while you build it
[2:31:06] <%goose_attack_almanac> @roofkie If you don't know how it works, pictures make things "Quantum Locked" and thus it doesn't change because it's fixed in that point in time
[2:31:07] <+Nenatab> Probably so what he photographs stay the same by being observed
[2:31:15] <Dugy123> Final ruuuuuuuuuuuule!!!
[2:31:19] <mrvidicus> Are these notes being left between different timelines?

[2:31:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> Standing on the rock lets you TELEPORT
[2:31:34] <%ShichiNoBushi> Stand on the rock and turn off your light?
[2:31:35] <%SirGO0SE> its all camera manipulation so more than likely the game removes the assets when not in view and redraws everytime an area is marked as quantum
[2:31:40] <+edited156> Stand on the rock and use it to teleport?
[2:31:42] <transporterthesequel> STAND ON THE rooock
[2:31:45] <%Estuko> He accepted his fate and touched the stone, he led a peaceful death
[2:31:46] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat think about it for a second. Her lantern died while her kid was standing on the shard.

[2:33:30] <transporterthesequel> This game is NUTS
[2:33:30] <gamewarden92> Quantum Pat has been born.

[2:33:31] <garbageheaphound> i hate this
[2:33:32] <+gutlesscoward> quantum is you
[2:33:34] <%PanicSwytch> IS IT A PORTAL OR WHAT?
[2:33:34] <@commanderclaw> My brain is full of fuck
[2:33:35] <+Shaggnar> 10/10 game
[2:33:36] <Dugy123> Pat have become quantum
[2:33:37] <%cureneckbeard> quantum stumby
[2:33:38] <DemonicHoward> puzzle solved
[2:33:38] <%arancet> remember a certain other dark room?

[2:33:44] <+Veenok> ITS TELEPORTING
[2:33:44] <garbageheaphound> this is giving me fucking anxiety holy shit
[2:33:44] <itesket> sand is slowly filling up tho
[2:33:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Are we ready for the moon now?
[2:33:45] <hellfirejefe> quantum rule learned

[2:34:15] <%Reveresao> go back
[2:34:16] <+Grayhammatter> it means baba is you
[2:34:16] <+Veenok> THE NUMBERS MASON
[2:34:17] <CherrieVelvet> seeing the map marker warp around is neat
[2:34:17] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> how can this be
[2:34:17] <ComptonRiot> pat go back

[2:34:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> How can this beee
[2:34:18] <+Scevda> HOW CAN THIS BE
[2:34:21] <ashuckel> you've been here befora
[2:34:22] <+SammyOVision> there is another new area, pat. you just missed it
[2:34:22] <@commanderclaw> That boy needs therapy
[2:34:24] <%MagickBurritoh> turn of the lights on the quantum moon
[2:34:25] <Dugy123> He ready for the moon
[2:34:26] <%BioApple> also switching the area that fast is super impressive from a technical standpoint
[2:34:26] <derekwst3> this reminds me of the weeping angels from dr who
[2:34:28] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat do you want it explained or no?
[2:34:29] <PKLoveLucas> there's 1 branch that you can only get to vi the rock
[2:34:31] <ashuckel> the one with spikes on the roof
[2:34:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> You can teleport with the objects if you can't see it change
[2:34:35] <%TIME_PUNCHER> TIME_PUNCHER subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! The day (Final) went up, I found out my wife was preggers. It was a confusing time. Today the channel-killer was born. Shadow Turok (aka THE BABY) has entered the game.

[2:34:44] <%Mr_Pylon> go back to rock

[2:36:01] <+SammyOVision> Yes!
[2:36:02] <+jcenderion> just click the light on and off instead of turning.
[2:36:02] <%Reveresao> yes
[2:36:03] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @akuda_bar he is my human elmo, all shall rejoice
[2:36:06] <gamewarden92> All these caves look the same

[2:36:57] <Dugy123> Become quantum
[2:36:58] <%foreverN2dust> Oh my god
[2:37:03] <InugamiTheHound> quantum break? Quantic dream?
[2:37:06] <itesket> Pat has the keys
[2:37:06] <%JGardner88> JGardner88 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Hey 8 months, wow! Here's to you having a good time with this amazing game. I on the other hand will maybe have to restart my entire FF14 progress
[2:37:09] <%dekkitout> Good thing the Nomai don't have active nightvision
[2:37:13] <+gutlesscoward> aw, coleus lived! that's nice, I'd have thought he died
[2:37:16] <mrvidicus> You should probably go back to tha ttree in a second.
[2:37:17] <+jcenderion> you could also just blink tho
[2:37:20] <ComptonRiot> hurrah!
[2:37:21] <KaseKaizer> all three rules crikIQ
[2:37:22] <%Gray_skies1993> oh my god this makes me wonder about the other rocks
[2:37:22] <ComptonRiot> learning!
[2:37:23] <Louie_Salmon> @angriestpat Do you remember that mural on the quantum moon? You have learned all 3 rules.
[2:37:23] <transporterthesequel> Fast travel yaaa!
[2:37:24] <Psyramics> here's a note explaining some shit you've already figured out
[2:37:26] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You could also just blink real slow
[2:37:26] <%Reveresao> your done
[2:37:26] <+QwertyThePie> @gutlesscoward He lived until he eventually died like everyone else
[2:37:26] <natebud> The pioneers used to ride these babies for miles
[2:37:27] <Tisaric> The way they present the nomai writing as new journal entries is so interesting to read
[2:37:28] <DemonicHoward> and thinking
[2:37:33] <%bakiinthedemon> When you come in contact with a quantum object and cease observing your surroundings you yourself become quantum NotLikeThis
[2:37:34] <JumbleJams> and puzzles
[2:37:36] <%RubberFistFight> So you've got 3 rules now. Entanglement, Imaging, and the 6th location.
[2:37:43] <transporterthesequel> Also that is so freakin cool
[2:37:44] <gamewarden92> Now he can dab on observation.
[2:37:45] <%SirGO0SE> yeah i would pay money for the code theyre using for object pooling because there have been like, what, 2 or 3 "hidden" load screens? and the amount of moving objects that have to be stored in memory and are constantly moving is nuts
[2:37:46] <+gutlesscoward> @QwertyThePie well I mean he didn't horrifically die of suffocation alone
[2:37:46] <DemonicHoward> see that wasnt so bad
[2:37:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @natebud it was only a matter of time before spongebob
[2:37:47] <%Reveresao> no
[2:37:50] <%IDTheftVictim> is touch not observing?
[2:37:51] <%RubberFistFight> auuugh
[2:37:51] <Nina96> we gonna deliver that pizza pat?
[2:37:52] <Dugy123> The moon is ready
[2:37:54] <%Frost_Quill> Do all the rocks do this?
[2:37:57] <%RubberFistFight> You shoulda gone to the other twin dude!
[2:37:58] <$Gehtingsberg> Go to ash twin
[2:37:59] <glaciusinfinite> NOW YOU KNOW ALL THREE QUANTUM SECRETS
[2:38:00] <+SammyOVision> That's actually all the info you need that the quantum moon says you need!
[2:38:02] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Are we ready for moon now? Are we READY for MOON?
[2:38:03] <$Gehtingsberg> Dang it
[2:38:03] <ashuckel> that's Quantum Entaglement isnt it
[2:38:06] <Naoyin> hell yeah
[2:38:06] <Dugy123> You have the knowledge
[2:38:06] <+Veenok> M O O N T I M E
[2:38:07] <gamewarden92> Yeyeyeye
[2:38:08] <+QwertyThePie> Moon time!
[2:38:08] <KaseKaizer> PogChamp
[2:38:08] <masterfire23> is that a spongebab reference?
[2:38:08] <hntronium> BUT THE TWIN
[2:38:09] <%salty_syd913> MOON TIME
[2:38:09] <%TeraMercier> @IDTheftVictim That's exactly what i've been thinking
[2:38:10] <%MagickBurritoh> Go to the ash twin now
[2:38:11] <%Reveresao> @lewdskeletor13 emote only chat for moon plz
[2:38:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> Time to moon
[2:38:14] <itesket> Try going to the bramble too
[2:38:16] <kane21601> time for M O O N
[2:38:16] <DemonicHoward> the moon seems like the last thing one should do in this game
[2:38:16] <%Puhff> apatBig MOON
[2:38:18] <Dugy123> BECOME MOON
[2:38:21] <%poker4121> Big brain time
[2:38:21] <+Veenok> SWOON 4 MOON
[2:38:21] <%Gray_skies1993> the other TWIN tho
[2:38:22] <Calek> yah moon time!
[2:38:23] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yaaaay, I'm clapping for moooon
[2:38:23] <$Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> DA MUN
[2:38:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> These quantum mechanics are able-ist. How dare they exclude blind people
[2:38:28] <%SirGO0SE> quick get stanley kubrick
[2:38:28] <glaciusinfinite> [ M O O N ]
[2:38:30] <WritebroAlpha> time for M O O N
[2:38:31] <%ElenaManetta> we're hunting for a moon
[2:38:31] <KaseKaizer> You TAKE THE MOON
[2:38:31] <%starotter70> I'm just along for the ride
[2:38:32] <%Puhff> Dawn of the FInal Day
[2:38:34] <Tisaric> @SirGO0SE they're so damn good at the hidden load screens, they loved playing with that in a lot of stuff pat has yet to see as well
[2:38:38] <mrvidicus> What about that creepy ass infinite-planet on the inside?
[2:38:38] <Nina96> travel with moon?
[2:38:40] <+Veenok> KICK THE MOON'S ASS
[2:38:43] <LodiFrostbeard> getting it to the north pole is hard, should we help him???
[2:38:44] <%RubberFistFight> @DemonicHoward yes and no. You can learn stuff there but if you're not erm... "ready" (and pat isn't) you can't end the game, so it's safe.
[2:38:47] <Louie_Salmon> @sirgo0se Not to mention the scout camera, which can let you snapshot a location, travel across the universe, and still snapshot that location.
[2:38:57] <InugamiTheHound> in dead space 3 the moons were full of necormorphs and they devour all life when they crash into a planet
[2:39:00] <JumbleJams> @Sphincter_Spelunker no blind people are the MOST quantum!
[2:39:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> Shrine needs to be at the North pole
[2:39:18] <natebud> moon
[2:39:22] <+Grayhammatter> oh, so we gotta look at the moon to keep it in place
[2:39:22] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @JumbleJams Because they never know where they are

[2:40:02] <%salty_syd913> oh nice
[2:40:03] <%Estuko> NANIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
[2:40:03] <InugamiTheHound> sixth location is the sixth gate to unlock your bankai

[2:40:07] <Dugy123> I mean... sure?
[2:40:07] <KaseKaizer> ...I guess?
[2:40:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Well he isn't wrong but he is not right

[2:40:13] <%MagickBurritoh> The revelaitons
[2:40:14] <%SirGO0SE> @tisaric @Louie_Salmon exactly. because of shit like the scout anything not completely inside has to be drawn immediately on each load. this game spent a lot of time in the oven for a reason
[2:40:14] <+jcenderion> ???
[2:40:14] <%bakiinthedemon> Whever helps
[2:40:18] <Zombrocom> Well yes, but also no
[2:40:20] <%GarbageQueenEllie> That's still as good a reason as any
[2:40:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> This is BIG BRAIN TIME
[2:40:25] <%kiiiirsten> Revelaitons 2
[2:40:26] <%RubberFistFight> NORTH POLES DON'T FACE AWAY FROM THE SUN GUYS. Think about planetary rotation and orbits.
[2:40:30] <itesket> Pat just forgot about the anglerfish
[2:40:32] <%RupanSen> "everything under the Sun is in tune, but the Sun is eclipsed by the quantum moon"
[2:40:35] <Dugy123> Yes but technically no
[2:40:38] <+QwertyThePie> @RubberFistFight Sometimes they do, look at Uranus's tilt
[2:40:45] <%Reveresao> just spin around pat
[2:40:45] <+Sestren413> It has to be on the north pole because otherwise there's rocks in the way. That's the only reason
[2:40:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> there
[2:40:51] <natebud> What ever happened to all that evil bramble?
[2:40:52] <PKLoveLucas> the moon one's on ember
[2:40:55] <+SammyOVision> That's an eye locator pat
[2:40:55] <zargy> you can also use the scanner
[2:41:01] <%GarbageQueenEllie> But the NORTH is what's facing UP
[2:41:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @natebud we'll get to that
[2:41:06] <+jcenderion> No thats on ember twin stumbo
[2:41:08] <$SweetCheeksTrap> i don't think that's how this works Pat, but sure.
[2:41:09] <LodiFrostbeard> @natebud bad fish in there not good
[2:41:10] <%Mornaka> @natebud we left because fish are spooky
[2:41:12] <CherrieVelvet> wasn't that ember twin?
[2:41:12] <%RubberFistFight> @QwertyThePie TBF they think it got smacked by something large and got its axis twisted.
[2:41:14] <Bearborg> this is a planet locator
[2:41:18] <Dugy123> To the mün
[2:41:18] <itesket> it was on ember twin
[2:41:20] <+Grayhammatter> no, it is not
[2:41:20] <%bakiinthedemon> You can just spin around a planet until you see it. It works the same as the shards
[2:41:21] <%Reveresao> that on ember
[2:41:22] <%RubberFistFight> @QwertyThePie so it wasn't that way naturally.
[2:41:24] <Tisaric> you can kind of just go looking for it

[2:41:28] <%dalmek> Ember twin boy
[2:41:30] <Louie_Salmon> You could always just spin around until it comes to you
[2:41:31] <%BioApple> just spin around really fast until you see it
[2:41:33] <+AWr00tBear> It’s on Ash twin
[2:41:34] <%Mr_Pylon> you can use your signalscope
[2:41:34] <+QwertyThePie> Yeah, but it does show that tilt can sometimes be high
[2:41:36] <+jcenderion> just use the scope
[2:41:36] <transporterthesequel> Ember twin bruv
[2:41:37] <ComptonRiot> just look for it lmao
[2:41:44] <+QwertyThePie> It may be how planets are formed, but it's not a 100% solid rule for how they behave
[2:41:49] <Bearborg> lmao it was on hollow and he looked away
[2:41:52] <Zombrocom> Have we been to the interloper yet?
[2:41:55] <itesket> Take a pic
[2:42:05] <+Bluemanzee> That signalscope really helped huh Kappa
[2:42:06] <mrvidicus> I love that the frequency scouter gun thing makes ungodly etheral noises.
[2:42:08] <%SirGO0SE> even without the scout im pretty sure youd still have to instantiate every single object since they all interact with eachother and influence eachothers movements
[2:42:08] <Tisaric> no interloper yet
[2:42:11] <%Reveresao> nope
[2:42:13] <+Scevda> ???
[2:42:14] <%king_wragles> Okay what I miss? Did Pat figure out how the guy disappeared yet?
[2:42:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> SHIT
[2:42:18] <CherrieVelvet> and it's gone
[2:42:19] <%Reveresao> and it gone
[2:42:20] <+jcenderion> just spin around hearth until its there
[2:42:20] <%RubberFistFight> @QwertyThePie it's also an edge case,which makes it statistically insignificant and thus not the likely reasoning behind why the quantum tower in a weird video game has to be on the north pole.

[2:44:23] <%king_wragles> @RubberFistFight Right, that's what I was getting at when I asked if you could close your eyes. I assumed you would trade places with the rock however, so 'riding' it is an interesting aspect

[2:44:37] <Zombrocom> That makes no sense but ok
[2:44:39] <Nina96> lucky
[2:44:40] <%Duskysan> Dude where’s my ship
[2:44:40] <transporterthesequel> Nah
[2:44:41] <+Tokanova> yup
[2:44:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> Not really
[2:44:42] <hntronium> Man there are so many clips
[2:44:42] <itesket> ???
[2:44:45] <%Reveresao> they must have patched
[2:44:45] <+Tokanova> so what happens when it orbits the eye
[2:44:47] <Tisaric> that's not the lesson
[2:44:49] <%dalmek> yep
[2:44:51] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Quantum moons, man. I tell ysa
[2:44:51] <transporterthesequel> You can get it to teleport
[2:44:53] <%MagickBurritoh> you lost sight of it you stumbo
[2:44:54] <PKLoveLucas> the SHRINE, pat
[2:44:55] <%galaxyswirl> WAT?????????
[2:44:55] <+edited156> Pat you're just assuming things
[2:44:56] <KnightReis> nah man i think thats just a high ass mountain
[2:44:57] <%RubberFistFight> @king_wragles it's important for the sixth rule, but Pat needs to work out how on his own. All 3 rules are, actually.
[2:44:58] <%starotter70> huh
[2:44:59] <Dugy123> Yes, on the right track
[2:44:59] <natebud> pat, pictures
[2:45:01] <KaseKaizer> remember the new rule crikIQ
[2:45:01] <PackysSportsBar> shhhh
[2:45:05] <transporterthesequel> By being on the moon, where you can turn out the lights
[2:45:06] <+SammyOVision> You gotta find a way to get to the north pole WITHOUT leaving the moon.
[2:45:06] <+Scevda> THis game hurts ones head
[2:45:06] <zargy> Press Y
[2:45:08] <%SirGO0SE> yeah, thats why a few of us are getting so hard over how they coded this
[2:45:09] <Louie_Salmon> Guys he'll figure it out
[2:45:11] <+AWr00tBear> Ash twin!
[2:45:12] <%RubberFistFight> @king_wragles sixth location I mean, not rule.
[2:45:14] <Klarrann3> @AngriestPat you stopped touching it and took your eyes away from it so it moved
[2:45:15] <%galaxyswirl> okay, is pat being dumb?
[2:45:24] <rumuloh> It went away because you stopped looking at it
[2:45:27] <%king_wragles> @RubberFistFight I'd assume as much. I'm trying to piece it together as well
[2:45:28] <%arancet> psst, you dont HAVE to be at the n pole if you want to check locations other than the eye/sixth
[2:45:33] <Nina96> does it have an order where it goes or is it random?
[2:45:35] <%JGardner88> Overthinking the mechanics I think more like
[2:45:37] <kane21601> @AngriestPat remember to take all the rules into account, all are needed
[2:45:44] <LodiFrostbeard> @galaxyswirl a little but the game is so strange you gotta cut him a break
[2:45:48] <glaciusinfinite> you need to look a t it then look away pat
[2:45:48] <PackysSportsBar> @galaxyswirl not really, it's a genuine puzzle
[2:45:51] <%SirGO0SE> if everything was on a set path itd be trivial but they need to load at least the logic of most of the game every time
[2:45:55] <+Tokanova> aaaaa
[2:45:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> you just lost it
[2:45:58] <%GoogleyGareth> aaAAAAAaaa
[2:45:58] <itesket> You just looked at it
[2:45:59] <gamewarden92> aaaaaaa
[2:46:11] <+emperri> fly me to the moon
[2:46:12] <%king_wragles> aaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[2:46:13] <%ElenaManetta> I find it way harder to try and find the moon with the sound gun
[2:46:14] <natebud> Take a picture it'll last longer
[2:46:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> that isn't how it works pat
[2:46:17] <%ElenaManetta> I just moved around until it appeared
[2:46:21] <WritebroAlpha> Pat just find the moon somewhere else, it doesn't matter what pl;anet it's orbiting
[2:46:24] <+Tokanova> moooon
[2:46:24] <%GoogleyGareth> SourPls
[2:46:26] <%MagickBurritoh> do the interloper it's a comet
[2:46:30] <+Tokanova> where for art thou moooon
[2:46:31] <glaciusinfinite> Spin pat
[2:46:31] <+geckosheer> NotLikeThis
[2:46:34] <cache_22> Spin in circles, that's a neat trick.
[2:46:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> look around dingus
[2:46:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> Why?
[2:46:37] <+Tokanova> spin to win
[2:46:38] <transporterthesequel> That dosen't matter pat
[2:46:38] <ashuckel> the moon orbits the sun. not a planet u stupid
[2:46:41] <%GoogleyGareth> speeeiin
[2:46:41] <hntronium> Pat where its in orbit doesn't matter
[2:46:41] <Nina96> SPIN
[2:46:42] <%RubberFistFight> @king_wragles honestly I'm gonna have the hardest fucking time not trying to give him hints and pointers. There's a spot I know he's gonna get stuck at, and he could have the epiphany in 5 seconds, or in 5 hours, there's no telling.
[2:46:43] <%arancet> easier to start by going to where it IS
[2:46:43] <Zombrocom> This isn't how it works
[2:46:45] <ashuckel> IT DOESNT ORBIT AROUND A PLANET
[2:46:47] <Louie_Salmon> You gotta spin like waaay more
[2:46:49] <$SweetCheeksTrap> Moon Chavs, Chavs on the moon
[2:46:49] <%Gray_skies1993> where its in orbit over doesn't matter
[2:46:55] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat just close your eyes LUL
[2:46:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat it has to be pinged to move
[2:46:57] <+QwertyThePie> @RubberFistFight They just put out an update that fixes that puzzle actually
[2:46:58] <glaciusinfinite> FULL SPINS PAT THAT LAME SHIT WONT CUT IT
[2:46:58] <+Tokanova> SourPls
[2:47:01] <+Tokanova> man this game music is nice
[2:47:05] <hntronium> Pat remember the rock on ash twin
[2:47:07] <%Broand> Rubber that's just the game
[2:47:07] <+QwertyThePie> So long as he updates the game before finishing it, he'll be fine
[2:47:09] <WritebroAlpha> As long as you don't jump off the fucking moon again, it doesn;t matter
[2:47:11] <%cureneckbeard> It doesn't make a bit of difference guys, the balls are inert
[2:47:11] <%SirGO0SE> @ElenaManetta thats actually the story of how Pat and Paige have their first born
[2:47:12] <Louie_Salmon> @ashuckel It does though
[2:47:14] <%bevyrage> free look should be enough
[2:47:14] <Tisaric> @ashuckel it literally doe
[2:47:18] <CherrieVelvet> well that works
[2:47:22] <%bevyrage> no need to spin the ship
[2:47:29] <transporterthesequel> Remember, you can get it to teleport when you can't observe it
[2:47:33] <LodiFrostbeard> this game is so pretty
[2:47:34] <+QwertyThePie> A lot of people don't know about freelook
[2:47:38] <+Tokanova> he wiggled his way to victory
[2:47:40] <Louie_Salmon> Uh oh
[2:47:42] <DemonicHoward> i feel like pat is not learning the right lessons when playing this game
[2:47:42] <LodiFrostbeard> look at that eclipse

[2:47:55] <transporterthesequel> That's how you swap the pole locations
[2:47:55] <Louie_Salmon> Wow actually saved it
[2:47:58] <rumuloh> I like how you can see the other stars go supernova in the background, like the dude said
[2:47:59] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Now your ship is clean
[2:48:02] <+Tokanova> pertty much
[2:48:03] <Dugy123> This is the hardest part, learn the properties of each quantum moon destination. This is like the only part of the game your not told about.
[2:48:06] <%MagickBurritoh> Don't jump
[2:48:10] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yeah when you get out look at your globe map
[2:48:12] <natebud> take a picture this time
[2:48:13] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> now take a picture of the surface
[2:48:14] <Delenay> that is neat. it does change properties
[2:48:22] <+Tokanova> easy
[2:48:22] <%bakiinthedemon> nope
[2:48:22] <CherrieVelvet> oh
[2:48:23] <DemonicHoward> can you

[2:54:25] <DSD24> Eye's on the inside
[2:54:27] <+waterbuddy16> not at the eye, just orbiting it
[2:54:30] <Louie_Salmon> @mrvidicus Dude there's a whole intro to this game with characters and dialogue and shit
[2:54:30] <%RubberFistFight> @ElenaManetta it's only a writing translator i think

[2:55:10] <%SirGO0SE> i was hoping this would happen from the start and was setting myself up for skeletons here. so happy . also youve definitely read this persons writings before i think

[2:55:20] <%Mr_Pylon> Do every combo!
[2:55:27] <%Tennochief> Selamat pagi
[2:55:27] <kane21601> @AngriestPat important to note, you can also do two blue or orange stones
[2:55:30] <Louie_Salmon> Pat is picking up on this stuff quickly
[2:55:31] <%Keyd00d> explain me
[2:55:39] <Tisaric> yeah you definitely find her writings elsewhere
[2:55:40] <$ZE_Count> they all give conversations pats.
[2:55:48] <%Reveresao> @AngriestPat you can put the same colors against each other
[2:55:56] <Louie_Salmon> Make sure you go through these systematically, you'll want to get all of them
[2:56:03] <%bakiinthedemon> Pat being polite by putting the stone back in the slots is adorable
[2:56:10] <+faithless_zealot> 5 head
[2:56:17] <%ElenaManetta> I can't wait until NASA back at home hears about this shit
[2:56:17] <%RupanSen> Outer Wilds - Everything is quantum!
[2:56:20] <%RubberFistFight> @Louie_Salmon which is funny considering how long it took him to work out the other stuff. That's why the game is great though, the process of discovery is different for everyone.
[2:56:22] <%starotter70> Wait
[2:56:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @bakiinthedemon I know, it's such a nice detail
[2:56:28] <+scargee> I see
[2:56:28] <%starotter70> so that's legit
[2:56:29] <aimlesshealer> @bakiinthedemon He's also asking the talking like the guy is real, it's honestly adorable
[2:56:32] <%starotter70> I was kidding
[2:56:32] <%Keyd00d> am I quantum
[2:56:34] <%Frost_Quill> Two blue?
[2:56:34] <%dalmek> dammit I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
[2:56:42] <%Reveresao> @Frost_Quill yes
[2:56:42] <Heyestus> In reality Quantum just means extremely small
[2:56:49] <+Scevda> Is this our generation's Myst?
[2:56:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:56:53] <%Frost_Quill> What if you do two blue?
[2:56:57] <%starotter70> This game is nuts

[2:59:37] <%RubberFistFight> She's dead in 5 other locations but alive here. That must fuck your brain pretty hard.
[2:59:37] <%Gray_skies1993> I believe other logs reference Solanum as being a woman
[2:59:38] <DSD24> "My time has come"
[2:59:40] <glaciusinfinite> GHOST
[2:59:40] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Sorry dude/gal/thing
[2:59:44] <$SweetCheeksTrap> @angriestpat This is a female Nomai btw. Your character's race is genderless though.
[2:59:49] <Frolomeo> When’s warframe?
[2:59:58] <+Veenok> Swithc it with Me
[2:59:59] <+SammyOVision> Yeah, Solanum is the corpse you find at the south pole at ANY other location the moon is in, they're only alive while here.
[3:00:02] <+Sestren413> yes
[3:00:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> He is in a state of superposition he isn't dead or alive
[3:00:06] <$SweetCheeksTrap> I just thought that was neat
[3:00:15] <%ShichiNoBushi> Permutations
[3:00:15] <%dekkitout> Mmmm Meee
[3:00:30] <%ElenaManetta> You ARE my answers
[3:00:31] <mrvidicus> Me and Baba
[3:00:43] <%bakiinthedemon> Fucking imagine
[3:00:43] <+Grayhammatter> baba is me?
[3:00:44] <+Tokanova> it uhhh
[3:00:44] <gamewarden92> Pat loves this shit.
[3:00:47] <LodiFrostbeard> BABA IS EVERYTHING
[3:00:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Sola's so nice. I hope you can help her out
[3:00:49] <%Gray_skies1993> this is REALLY interesting
[3:00:49] <+Veenok> Is this how one becomes Galaxy Brain?
[3:00:49] <+Tokanova> it'd fuck shit up i bet
[3:00:54] <+jcenderion> Then Moon and Eye
[3:00:55] <%RubberFistFight> @Futurecity10 sure is - but given that the moon exists in superposition, each "state" is valid, although on balance the universe is likely to consider her dead since quantum effects are probabilistic, and she's dead in 83% of cases. So dead is "more probable" than alive.
[3:00:56] <+twohitgood> i wish i could ask....does he not consider himself an observer?
[3:00:57] <shevan123> pat you gotta jump into that raging hole in the sky
[3:00:57] <Nina96> death or worse?
[3:00:59] <Ner234> We're ALL Baba on this blessed day.

[3:01:26] <Tisaric> nope
[3:01:26] <%RubberFistFight> nope, you asked if this was the corpse
[3:01:28] <+Sestren413> no
[3:01:30] <SoySocks> that should be all of them

[3:02:56] <Gorshum> oroThump
[3:02:57] <Tisaric> That's just the teaser
[3:02:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Superposition is a bitch
[3:02:59] <FutaSnek> QUANTUM DEATH
[3:02:59] <%RubberFistFight> Uhm
[3:02:59] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Bye Goat Lady #2
[3:02:59] <%RupanSen> IT WAS A GHOST
[3:03:00] <Pixel_gee> I NEVER REALIZED THAT
[3:03:00] <+QwertyThePie> They're only 1/6 alive
[3:03:01] <Nina96> NotLikeThis
[3:03:02] <+Veenok> BibleThump
[3:03:02] <mrvidicus> But that's their mask that you're going to see when you die.
[3:03:02] <%Estuko> See you Space Cowboy
[3:03:04] <Zombrocom> Stopped observing the moon
[3:03:06] <+MellowMute> PepeHands
[3:03:07] <kane21601> so they're in a quantum state between life and death
[3:03:07] <3xgilly> this still doesnt make sense
[3:03:08] <%dekkitout> Just like the Dwarves in Elder Scrolls
[3:03:10] <%Agami23> omg. quantum death
[3:03:10] <Delenay> did you f up?
[3:03:11] <+Revets315> holy shit i never got those combos on my playthrough thanks pat!
[3:03:13] <KaseKaizer> now you finish what they started
[3:03:13] <Tisaric> They only exist in a quantum state
[3:03:13] <Bearborg> space ghost
[3:03:14] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> You're gonna carry that weight @AngriestPat
[3:03:15] <+linSP> helo im here :) did bat win
[3:03:15] <+waterbuddy16> how can this be?
[3:03:16] <LodiFrostbeard> CHILLS THIS GIVES ME
[3:03:17] <SoySocks> it's like alternate timelines
[3:03:18] <%bakiinthedemon> Pat I'm curious as to what you think the goal here is?
[3:03:21] <%Agami23> they only died on other moons, not the real moon. or some shit
[3:03:21] <FutaSnek> QUANTUM FUCKING DEATH
[3:03:23] <Dugy123> Ghost monologues, everybody gets one
[3:03:24] <al0nem0nster> does that mean there are 5 other you's on each version of the quantum moon?
[3:03:26] <+linSP> pats fuckin dead
[3:03:26] <%goose_attack_almanac> Time Ghost
[3:03:27] <+Karasseram> means you must rejoin the shards to ressurect Zodiark
[3:03:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> @mrvidicus yes because they figured out how to travel information back in time
[3:03:27] <%Tennochief> Why
[3:03:28] <%Reveresao> alive and dead at the dame time
[3:03:28] <kane21601> which is an incredibly cool concept
[3:03:30] <+Shaggnar> He was at both locations at the same time. alive and dead
[3:03:30] <LodiFrostbeard> BYE BYE
[3:03:31] <+Grayhammatter> oh no
[3:03:31] <%PinkSuprende> That Nomai is the cat in the box that aint alive or dead until you look at it
[3:03:31] <Moonlight_Grimoire> so... thats not the end of the game obviously
[3:03:31] <Bearborg> schrodinger'd
[3:03:33] <Tisaric> GOD THAT'S COOL
[3:03:34] <%dalmek> nobody observed them die so they're alive at the sixth location
[3:03:34] <T3merity> What was that sound?
[3:03:34] <+OkamiDude15> and there goes the sun
[3:03:35] <%ShichiNoBushi> Nova!
[3:03:35] <transporterthesequel> He is both dead and alive while on the eye quantum moon
[3:03:37] <Tisaric> YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHTING
[3:03:37] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat schrodingers cat
[3:03:38] <%ElenaManetta> Schrodinger's Moon
[3:03:39] <%StripesUltimateEdition> alive somewhere dead elsewhere
[3:03:41] <%Tennochief> so poetic, so tragic
[3:03:44] <glaciusinfinite> SCHRODINGER
[3:03:45] <DRAGKUDO> Would we heat the moon implode?
[3:03:47] <T3merity> Also, i think it means Omae ha mou shinderu
[3:03:47] <Futurecity10> Wait so did he beat the game?
[3:03:48] <%king_wragles> @T3merity that
[3:03:48] <%starotter70> oops
[3:03:48] <$SweetCheeksTrap> @angriestpat is this our Myst?
[3:03:48] <Meekest> What if you'd stayed in there until the sun exploded?
[3:03:48] <+Veenok> @PinkSuprende Schrodinger's Outer Wilds
[3:03:49] <DRAGKUDO> i mean the sun
[3:03:50] <transporterthesequel> Just like you will eternally be there asking him questions
[3:03:51] <DSD24> What is happening
[3:03:53] <+geckosheer> BibleThump
[3:03:54] <%Puhff> eyes
[3:03:56] <+SammyOVision> If you stayed at the sixth location pat, you'd be out of the range of the supernova
[3:03:59] <+Grayhammatter> guess we didn't beat it
[3:04:01] <%RubberFistFight> He didn't beat it but he's now in the final phase, more or less.
[3:04:01] <%SolverCODO> insight gained
[3:04:03] <LodiFrostbeard> @DSD24 sun wen't boom
[3:04:11] <+Veenok> HES IN THE ENDGAME NOW
[3:04:14] <Tisaric> We're definitely in Act 3
[3:04:14] <Moonlight_Grimoire> ships log and I think Ash Twin's project is what's next?
[3:04:15] <Delenay> should try to get back?
[3:04:17] <PKLoveLucas> for some reason she couldn't have died when the moon was at the eye
[3:04:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DSD24 we met the forrunners who gave us most of our tech and then he died from the lack of observation
[3:04:22] <Deekman> So excited to watch the VOD
[3:04:23] <JumbleJams> bramble and interloper
[3:04:24] <glaciusinfinite> me spel bad
[3:04:30] <A_Traitor> whats the hecks goin on with the bramble though
[3:04:32] <mrvidicus> The Eye is Elmo.
[3:04:35] <%galaxyswirl> HOL UP
[3:04:36] <%MagickBurritoh> So what is that explosion
[3:04:37] <+OkamiDude15> seek the sixth location and transcend the quantum hunt
[3:04:41] <+Grayhammatter> jesus christ, this game is nuts
[3:04:41] <DSD24> @doc_ock_rokc So we are in a loop now?
[3:04:43] <%galaxyswirl> LOOK AT THE BOOM AGIAN
[3:04:45] <transporterthesequel> Yeah the eye version of the moon is just eternal time
[3:04:46] <+Tokanova> QUANTUM
[3:04:47] <%Mornaka> @MagickBurritoh the sun
[3:04:49] <%Scottigecko> yo interloper is rad you should go there
[3:04:52] <%ColonelRozum> @MagickBurritoh do you mean the sun going super nova?
[3:04:53] <%sunny_side_up> i wonder if gabbro has any comments on meeting solanum
[3:04:55] <DemonicHoward> @MagickBurritoh probe being shot off in random directions
[3:04:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dsd24 we always have been
[3:04:55] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Living" nomai.
[3:04:55] <al0nem0nster> @MagickBurritoh the sun exploding.
[3:04:58] <transporterthesequel> Technically you're still there
[3:05:00] <%Reveresao> Quantum moon pathway is done!
[3:05:01] <%MagickBurritoh> the explosion at the start
[3:05:01] <%BioApple> love that the solanum entry has an exclamation point
[3:05:02] <Delenay> should you have taken a pic of the moon then gone up?
[3:05:05] <%galaxyswirl> the cannon JUST FIRED INTO ITSELF
[3:05:06] <%MagickBurritoh> purple one
[3:05:07] <LodiFrostbeard> @PlainSimpleTailor wen'tn't

[3:05:20] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @LodiFrostbeard LUL\
[3:05:22] <Meekest> Well fuckin now what
[3:05:23] <%arancet> youve solved the moon, grats, but theres more out there....

[3:05:31] <glaciusinfinite> NotLikeThis
[3:05:31] <%Keyd00d> Am I real?
[3:05:35] <Tisaric> the moon is just a piece of the puzzle
[3:05:35] <%Keyd00d> Does the bus run through here?
[3:05:38] <KnightReis> this is how you make a puzzle and exploration game real engaging
[3:05:39] <KilljoyHexx> @JumbleJams Are any of us alive or real?
[3:05:40] <%galaxyswirl> im pretty sure i just saw the probe get shot into giants deep
[3:05:40] <Zombrocom> Can you dodge the supernova by hanging out at the eye, since it's outside of the universe?
[3:05:43] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @LodiFrostbeard You almost had me panicked
[3:05:44] <%king_wragles> @Keyd00d why are my shoes wet?
[3:05:44] <LodiFrostbeard> @PlainSimpleTailor i'm retarde (also english isn't my first language)

[3:06:18] <KilljoyHexx> Really... how do you KNOW other people ARE real?
[3:06:19] <+gutlesscoward> time to rock with the diggity dark bramble
[3:06:21] <%ColonelRozum> pat slow down
[3:06:26] <Tisaric> IT'S SO COOL
[3:06:27] <Louie_Salmon> I am too terrified to go to this planet
[3:06:27] <FutaSnek> Conceptually bramble is my fav planet
[3:06:28] <Bearborg> game's pretty good huh
[3:06:29] <transporterthesequel> Yes, Yes it was
[3:06:30] <KaseKaizer> don't let it set in
[3:06:31] <%bakiinthedemon> Hell ye sp00ky fish tree planet lets go!
[3:06:32] <chronoxgp> good thing i missed it then
[3:06:33] <mrvidicus> I -hate- this planet. This planet is EVIL.
[3:06:34] <Futurecity10> Hey, can someone who knows, whisper me if theirs something on Brittle Hallow's moon?
[3:06:34] <Ner234> RAMMING SPEED
[3:06:34] <+waterbuddy16> you had literally all the tools from the start
[3:06:34] <LodiFrostbeard> @linSP which one would that be?
[3:06:34] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @LodiFrostbeard OH, well you are entirely excused. We have young people in America putting apostrophes in weird places now LUL no harm, man.
[3:06:36] <+InEzrealwetrust> Please don't forget to breath @AngriestPat
[3:06:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Amaaazing
[3:06:38] <%ShichiNoBushi> This music reminds me of Carl Sagan's Cosmos.
[3:06:40] <Louie_Salmon> This game really is The Witness, but for Pat
[3:06:42] <kane21601> it is a FANTASTIC puzzle
[3:06:42] <glaciusinfinite> ITS VERY GOOD
[3:06:43] <%foreverN2dust> quantum death is pretty metal
[3:06:44] <Jack_of_No_Trades> It was absolutely awesome.
[3:06:45] <%Keyd00d> I missed it, just came in when you solved it
[3:06:47] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> 6 years
[3:06:47] <%Gray_skies1993> same
[3:06:47] <+Grayhammatter> wow, this planet is fucked
[3:06:48] <Tisaric> Especially since you learn 3 rules from 3 extremely good puzzles in their own rights
[3:06:51] <+QwertyThePie> Quantum Death sounds like a band name
[3:06:51] <%Nobrev> @transporterthesequel why do we need to turn the lights out if the anglers are already blind
[3:06:52] <+linSP> shoot that cam pat
[3:06:53] <WritebroAlpha> INTERLOPER NEAR MISS
[3:06:53] <natebud> It's cool because you didn't unlock any new abilities, just knowledge @AngriestPat
[3:06:54] <CherrieVelvet> fish time
[3:06:54] <chronoxgp> so this is basically like mario galaxy?
[3:06:59] <+Aeoneth> PAt did you ever play Antichamber? There's a bunch of puzzle like that
[3:07:00] <+Sestren413> BRAMBLE TIIIIIME!
[3:07:03] <+linSP> holy shit HE DID almost hit the comet
[3:07:05] <%ShichiNoBushi> Red light?
[3:07:08] <%Scottigecko> equip your soundscope
[3:07:09] <transporterthesequel> OH yeah, sound then right?
[3:07:12] <JumbleJams> which is better, being a toilet or quantum death?
[3:07:12] <hntronium> scope?
[3:07:13] <PKLoveLucas> try using the signlscope to navigate
[3:07:15] <Pixel_gee> monkaS
[3:07:16] <%ShichiNoBushi> Red light was angler fish before.
[3:07:19] <Tisaric> Soundgun helps here
[3:07:19] <%Mr_Pylon> Find Feldspar time!
[3:07:20] <%SolverCODO> check for a signal
[3:07:22] <%Reveresao> he still doesn't know where to go...

[3:07:24] <+Grayhammatter> oh boy
[3:07:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> When this lp is finished, I'm gonna buy the game and skip to the end like a jackass

[3:08:29] <+QwertyThePie> @Sphincter_Spelunker The ship headlights, not the lure
[3:08:34] <+SammyOVision> Headlights are fine, it's just keep an eye on your thrust, go super slow
[3:08:35] <%MelBrooksKA> Because the collective conscious are dumb
[3:08:44] <derekwst3> try it, its not like you cant die
[3:08:45] <%RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc by either jetting when they're not around and coasting past, or by only jetting to a certain count on the display (which I'm keeping secret)
[3:08:47] <Deekman> The headlights are fine. You just need to drift silently

[3:10:01] <KnightReis> oh god pat and woolie learning to decelerate in a car would be horrifying
[3:10:02] <imposivestar> the son station
[3:10:04] <%bakiinthedemon> What could possibly be on a sun station patty wack
[3:10:04] <%Yadogari> wait how
[3:10:04] <DemonicHoward> really?
[3:10:06] <+QwertyThePie> You can land on the sun station
[3:10:11] <aimlesshealer> Sun so hot, hot hot sun
[3:10:11] <+Grayhammatter> the son station
[3:10:11] <+QwertyThePie> Good luck though
[3:10:15] <alrobot2014> is that the thing some of the nomai said not to build?
[3:10:17] <DemonicHoward> man you big blind
[3:10:17] <%ElenaManetta> I can't land on it because I'm scared and bad
[3:10:21] <+jpivot> oh, a big patch just came out
[3:10:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Yadogari he was embarissed about crashing into the sun
[3:10:25] <Deekman> What did he get done tonight?
[3:10:25] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> apatCrazyhand
[3:10:26] <3xgilly> Dank Bramble
[3:10:26] <aimlesshealer> Sun so hot it fry my buns
[3:10:27] <%RubberFistFight> @ElenaManetta same
[3:10:28] <%crimsonharvest> you can probably teleport to it right? dont most of these buildings connect somehow?
[3:10:28] <hellfirejefe> THIS was the one planet that perked up my anxiety
[3:10:29] <%bakiinthedemon> Only if your a pro gamer
[3:10:30] <+Scevda> You can land on the sun, just gotta believe that its not a sun
[3:10:32] <InsomniacPersona> @ElenaManetta no worries we are all cowards here
[3:10:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @hellfirejefe then it did a good job
[3:10:42] <+Grayhammatter> sun so hot, hot hot sun
[3:10:46] <Bearborg> oh hey the big patch for this game just dropped
[3:10:48] <Psyramics> You can land on the sun, you just have to wait for it to be night time
[3:10:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its such a fucking shame this is on the epic store
[3:10:52] <%BioApple> @Deekman solved giant's deep, explored the twins a little, solved the moon
[3:10:55] <Louie_Salmon> @crimsonharvest It does have the teleporter symbol on it, no idea where the other side is though
[3:10:56] <kane21601> if you wanna land on the sun, just land when its night time, duh
[3:11:03] <shevan123> uh oh
[3:11:04] <transporterthesequel> So yeah big coast
[3:11:06] <Tisaric> I keep playing these amazing games before these great QoL updates and it's getting a little annoying
[3:11:08] <+SammyOVision> Another place to land that's super hard is Hollows lantern, and I REALLY wanna see whats there, there's NO info online about it.
[3:11:09] <%RupanSen> looks like a big quantum asshole
[3:11:10] <%RubberFistFight> @hellfirejefe man, i heard about how awful this place was before i came here, but i'm the LEAST anxious when I'm here. The "bigger on the inside" thing is so awesome it totally vetoes my brain's anxiety powers.
[3:11:13] <%starotter70> Floor it
[3:11:18] <%arancet> not all
[3:11:19] <+linSP> its me :)
[3:11:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> I would buy this now in a heartbeat if it was on steam
[3:11:20] <Nina96> stomach?
[3:11:21] <Meekest> Assumedly
[3:11:22] <%ElenaManetta> No, they're tricks
[3:11:23] <EuropanLamprey> RAMMING SPEED
[3:11:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Or gog
[3:11:26] <%Tennochief> fishy time
[3:11:26] <imposivestar> @ElenaManetta the closest I ever got to landing on it, the ship was coming in too fast and it exploded on impact and had me orbiting the sun until I died lmao
[3:11:27] <+QwertyThePie> @Tisaric They put out another big QoL update today, streamer doesn't have it because it came out while he was streaming
[3:11:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> or greenman
[3:11:33] <Louie_Salmon> You flew at a white light before and were fine
[3:11:36] <%RubberFistFight> @ElenaManetta Silly Elena, tricks are for kids. Kappa
[3:11:37] <%ElenaManetta> Some white lights are entrance seeds you saw, some are fish
[3:11:40] <+Grayhammatter> oh god, i don't like this at all
[3:11:42] <Deekman> Except the ones that arent
[3:11:46] <+Mondeiya> i tried to buy this game on epic for the first time and it deadass said it couldn't complete my transaction then debited and credited my account anyways...
[3:11:50] <%Reveresao> @AngriestPat use drone
[3:11:55] <+spheelman> go get out harmonica boi
[3:11:57] <KingVantq> thats a fish for sure
[3:12:00] <%SolverCODO> VERY gentle
[3:12:00] <%DexteraXIII> Fuck that
[3:12:01] <HeadsHeldHigh> back that ass up
[3:12:04] <%Deft_Thought> God damn that is scary
[3:12:07] <+WizardofAahz> monkaS
[3:12:10] <+Nenatab> Nope
[3:12:10] <%SolverCODO> EASY BOYS, EASY
[3:12:10] <thegreenbenis> BACK DAT ASS UP
[3:12:12] <%GoogleyGareth> That's an aaaalliieen space fish
[3:12:14] <al0nem0nster> he's still drifting towards the fish isn't he.
[3:12:19] <%bakiinthedemon> Momentum is your friend when it comes to fish
[3:12:19] <%Gray_skies1993> FUCK this place with a capital F
[3:12:20] <%GarbageQueenEllie> the fishy is upside down
[3:12:24] <%ElenaManetta> You might want to use your probe like you did on Timber
[3:12:25] <derekwst3> who else is holding their breath
[3:12:25] <+QwertyThePie> Oh good, he's on controller
[3:12:26] <Futurecity10> God I fucking hate this
[3:12:27] <%ElenaManetta> It might help
[3:12:29] <+QwertyThePie> This part is much easier with a controller
[3:12:30] <Bearborg> a low burn is safe, full burn is death
[3:12:31] <%GoogleyGareth> apatHoldon
[3:12:31] <FutaSnek> WHAT PROPELLS THEM!
[3:12:31] <hellfirejefe> the sand and blackhole didn't get me but these damn fish nearly made me have a heart attack
[3:12:34] <derekwst3> press f for fish
[3:12:34] <thegreenbenis> Fuck that.
[3:12:35] <FutaSnek> I DONT GET IT
[3:12:40] <Deekman> This part is fine with a keyboard
[3:12:41] <%Broand> IT IS
[3:12:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @FutaSnek fart gass
[3:12:43] <%Broand> IT REALLY IS
[3:12:45] <shevan123> you bet your ass
[3:12:47] <%SolverCODO> This is actually NOT POSSIBLE on PC
[3:12:48] <Tisaric> It's why they recommend a controller so heavily
[3:12:48] <al0nem0nster> can't wait for the vr port.
[3:12:49] <%foreverN2dust> how did woolie not get eaten here monkaS
[3:12:50] <Deekman> No. Nothing is save except drifting
[3:12:52] <%GoogleyGareth> why?
[3:12:56] <%bakiinthedemon> Sneeze on youre mouse and your dead
[3:12:56] <+AWr00tBear> Is this the lost woods
[3:13:00] <RealThiele> space butthole
[3:13:02] <%SolverCODO> you CANNOT beat this with a keyboard because you can only use full throttle
[3:13:04] <FutaSnek> @doc_ock_rokc That is litterally the only plausable explanation I can think of
[3:13:06] <%DexteraXIII> I'm not playing it at all, and it's wracking my nerves
[3:13:08] <+Grayhammatter> this space butthole
[3:13:08] <+Shaggnar> Nah, people do way more delicate shit in KSP
[3:13:09] <Calek> woolie crashed and died here, got nowhere near a fish
[3:13:11] <DemonicHoward> layer 2
[3:13:18] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I play it on PC and I think this place is rad. Giants Deep and the Twins though? They can get fucked.
[3:13:18] <%ElenaManetta> I did this with keyboard : ( ?
[3:13:19] <%Gray_skies1993> @AWr00tBear pretty much
[3:13:19] <Deekman> @solvercodo I did it with just a mouse. It was fine
[3:13:20] <transporterthesequel> wut
[3:13:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @FutaSnek its their biocurse
[3:13:22] <PKLoveLucas> yeah, you can't control the level of thrust w/ a keyboard so you have to drift along at minimum speed after boosting while it's safe
[3:13:23] <%GoogleyGareth> Put away that Harmonica
[3:13:24] <%Reveresao> @AngriestPat use drone
[3:13:25] <+jpivot> @SolverCODO you can, you just have to get a running start and use the momentum to drift past
[3:13:30] <+waterbuddy16> scout it out
[3:13:34] <%starotter70> oh boy
[3:13:34] <kingbaconcrispy> Inferior PC race
[3:13:37] <Jack_of_No_Trades> We have to go deeper
[3:13:40] <Zombrocom> This is fucked
[3:13:44] <+linSP> i remember the first thing woolie did was fly here and total his ship and run out of o2
[3:13:47] <%king_wragles> I don't like this
[3:13:48] <HeadsHeldHigh> thats some yog sotthoth shit
[3:13:49] <+Bluemanzee> What's a gamepad? 4Head
[3:13:49] <Tisaric> I mean just plug a controller in 4Head
[3:13:49] <%BioApple> i mean, you can use controllers on pc too
[3:13:50] <%MagickBurritoh> must be eight of them in here
[3:13:53] <aimlesshealer> Deep sea fanglyfish
[3:13:56] <FutaSnek> I want an entire game of this.
[3:13:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat you bought this on xbox?
[3:14:06] <al0nem0nster> they did a phantastic job of putting deep sea horror into a space exploration game
[3:14:10] <KingVantq> @doc_ock_rokc pc
[3:14:11] <FutaSnek> This setting is the fucking strongest
[3:14:11] <+Grayhammatter> what is that?
[3:14:12] <%GarbageQueenEllie> But WHY is it brambly
[3:14:13] <%Broand> prank'd
[3:14:13] <alrobot2014> no he's on pc with a controller plugged in
[3:14:15] <gamewarden92> it's a pokey seed
[3:14:18] <thegreenbenis> This is actually pretty spooky.
[3:14:19] <imposivestar> launching the probe is killing his momentum
[3:14:19] <Bearborg> signalscope is a LIAR sometimes
[3:14:20] <TimetodiveLTX> celeste is pretty good, i just played the first 3 levels
[3:14:22] <Ion_Laser> I bet this would be fun with a joystick
[3:14:23] <%SolverCODO> @jpivot sure but if you have to adjust at all, anywhere even close to a fish you'll die
[3:14:25] <FutaSnek> @AngriestPat Remember the dark bramble seed?
[3:14:29] <Deekman> Solve it
[3:14:30] <%bakiinthedemon> *Nervously singing Staying Alive*
[3:14:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> BIGGER on the inside
[3:14:34] <hntronium> space?
[3:14:34] <%salty_syd913> do it
[3:14:34] <+Shaggnar> Puzzles
[3:14:37] <Bearborg> tricked hard
[3:14:38] <+QwertyThePie> Controllers don't work all that well on PC with this game
[3:14:38] <Psyramics> they're all bigger on the inside!
[3:14:40] <+OkamiDude15> solve the puzzle pat
[3:14:40] <%MagickBurritoh> It has a hole
[3:14:41] <%galaxyswirl> PUZZLES
[3:14:41] <+Bluemanzee> It's got Blues Clues house logic
[3:14:41] <ashuckel> remember the other flower
[3:14:43] <Aephol> Puzzle time
[3:14:43] <kane21601> @AngriestPat remeber the seed on hearth?
[3:14:44] <hntronium> non euclidean I guess
[3:14:45] <+MisterRockett> Have you not been here yet? This is, like, the FIRST place Woolie went.
[3:14:45] <+QwertyThePie> Believe me, I tried
[3:14:46] <%ElenaManetta> You will have to use the probe like you did at the beginning of the game
[3:14:46] <+Shaggnar> Big space puzles
[3:14:48] <%arancet> space isorigami'd in on itself many times
[3:14:48] <mrvidicus> Does he have to get out of his ship?
[3:14:49] <DemonicHoward> just a small hint you solved this puzzle before
[3:14:50] <Calek> @QwertyThePie that's wierd I had no issue whatsoever
[3:14:52] <PKLoveLucas> ye scout time
[3:14:53] <Tisaric> non euclidean geometry is fun!
[3:14:54] <%galaxyswirl> BIG THINK PAT
[3:14:54] <+QwertyThePie> They fixed it with updates
[3:14:55] <Deekman> PUZZLE!
[3:14:56] <+linSP> climb inside
[3:14:56] <%Scottigecko> damn this seems awfully familiar
[3:14:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> fire probe
[3:15:00] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat remember you fired a camera into that seed in like the first episode of this, and you said "it's definitely non-euclidean"
[3:15:04] <JumbleJams> thinking! and puzzles!
[3:15:05] <+edited156> Why get out?
[3:15:06] <shevan123> go on fuckboy
[3:15:07] <%Reveresao> NotLikeThis
[3:15:07] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Is the Dark Bramble like a series of Iconian Gates?

[3:30:36] <shevan123> yeyey
[3:30:36] <gamewarden92> Yes
[3:30:36] <+QwertyThePie> Could be a good idea to find the vessel
[3:30:39] <Naoyin> u can totally do it
[3:30:40] <Futurecity10> All thats left is the vessel I would assume
[3:30:41] <%starotter70> Sure
[3:30:41] <+Ell1ot> hit the Wessel
[3:30:43] <hntronium> whats it like without all the sand
[3:30:44] <Louie_Salmon> I mean yeah, that seems like a good thing to find
[3:30:45] <Tisaric> I actually would really suggest getting the patch since one of these last puzzles got a nice fix @AngriestPat
[3:30:45] <+MellowMute> DO IT
[3:30:48] <ComptonRiot> still gotta hit the interloper at some point
[3:30:50] <kane21601> @AngriestPat remember, one of the escape pods also crashed there
[3:30:52] <Deekman> Sun station!
[3:30:53] <$HyperionXV> there's also the Interloper
[3:30:55] <+Scevda> Mooo
[3:30:57] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Vessel then Giants deep?
[3:30:58] <+Grayhammatter> oh boy, here we go

[3:30:59] <+linSP> spooky music
[3:31:02] <Deekman> Or the Interloper
[3:31:02] <+QwertyThePie> The patch is out actually
[3:31:03] <%RupanSen> what friendly sound
[3:31:06] <mrvidicus> So is the Dark Bramble a self sustaining organism orbiting the sun? And GOD that's creepy.
[3:31:07] <Tisaric> it came out during
[3:31:07] <+QwertyThePie> The patch just came out, while you were streaming
[3:31:09] <%starotter70> That's a horrible noise
[3:31:10] <aimlesshealer> Weeeooooeeeeoooooeeeee
[3:31:10] <$Falilth> i just got the patch
[3:31:10] <Bearborg> it dropped during stream
[3:31:11] <%RubberFistFight> @ElenaManetta afaik they're impossible to kill - once they're on a planet, that's it, it's doomed.
[3:31:12] <DemonicHoward> durring

[3:31:30] <+Grayhammatter> time to update that shit
[3:31:30] <%corepool> update this bitch
[3:31:30] <%dekkitout> That sounds like the sound at the beginning of every trailer for a Zach Snyder movie
[3:31:30] <+RushUnplugged> "pat's streaming, let's patch NOW"
[3:31:32] <%ElenaManetta> what does the patch add!
[3:31:34] <+yeeyeyee> who the fuck designed distress beacons to be this distressing
[3:31:36] <%cureneckbeard> patch stream
[3:31:37] <Jetsfantasy> Watch it break more stuff
[3:31:37] <HeadsHeldHigh> smoller pat
[3:31:38] <+SammyOVision> what does it fix?
[3:31:38] <%RupanSen> "for a second"
[3:31:39] <+AlMiRajGaming> only for a second?
[3:31:39] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> for a second he says
[3:31:39] <%Yadogari> For a second? LUL
[3:31:41] <%corepool> S H R I N K
[3:31:41] <+QwertyThePie> @yeeyeyee This is in fact the point
[3:31:42] <%foreverN2dust> apatHoldon

[3:31:45] <+punit216> just one second
[3:31:47] <+ultracoolboy7> for a second time?
[3:31:47] <%Anonymasque> Patches usually fix some stuff right?
[3:31:47] <%cureneckbeard> nyannSmug
[3:31:47] <Tisaric> it makes one of the last puzzles a bit more understandable, it was really obscure before
[3:31:49] <mrvidicus> That sound reminded me of the Silent Hill 2 OST.
[3:31:50] <%starotter70> You wish
[3:31:54] <Jetsfantasy> BACKUP SAVE
[3:31:54] <Clyderso> New patch adds small pat

[3:32:03] <+InEzrealwetrust> Thats [Crazy Talk]
[3:32:04] <%RubberFistFight> @Scevda he's actually covered most of the difficult stuff already. He just has to find the vessel, visit the sun station, visit the interloper and the ash twin project.
[3:32:04] <+QwertyThePie> To pass time
[3:32:05] <%ElenaManetta> PATching

[3:32:11] <+ultracoolboy7> Pat-ching
[3:32:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Epic bought Death Stranding. Prob
[3:32:15] <DemonicHoward> @AngriestPat legit concern do we know if patch wipes your save
[3:32:16] <%foreverN2dust> It's been good the whole time, it's crazy
[3:32:17] <chronoxgp> i thought valve made this game haha
[3:32:19] <$HyperionXV> "Players can now sleep at campfires to fast-forward time. This automatically becomes available after a few loops." PogChamp
[3:32:20] <tanarath> It's probably one of the best games ever.
[3:32:27] <+Scevda> So it doesn't make a difference then? @RubberFistFight
[3:32:29] <+ShortThrowDipstick> Patch nerfs oxygen and fuel by 35% /s
[3:32:36] <Naoyin> "Slightly more speed is retained when traveling through a certain area in Dark Bramble." good timing
[3:32:41] <HeadsHeldHigh> aahhhhh dont say that BibleThump
[3:32:41] <Deekman> @shortthrowdipstick true?

[3:32:54] <MrGarettLefebvre> Turn it on and off again
[3:32:57] <+ShortThrowDipstick> @deekman Nah kidding
[3:32:57] <aimlesshealer> A likely story.
[3:32:57] <TheShadowWolfen> this is the game you talked bout on the podcast and stuff right?

[3:33:09] <%RubberFistFight> @Scevda not at this point no, if it was a new game, some of the puzzles have been clarified a little bit
[3:33:09] <Meekest> Start scratching your nuts so you can stop
[3:33:11] <%ElenaManetta> You have said many times your balls reach the floor so
[3:33:12] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@Choziro) (warning)
[3:33:13] <%ElenaManetta> Honest mistake
[3:33:13] <+InEzrealwetrust> WE DEMAND MORE CUBE
[3:33:14] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat stop scratching your ankle nut
[3:33:14] <%Tennochief> just sparring with my cock
[3:33:18] <Deekman> @shortthrowdipstick lmao you had me going for a second 🤣
[3:33:18] <%starotter70> Same thing honestly
[3:33:18] <+AlMiRajGaming> Pat you can scratch your nuts as much as you need.
[3:33:18] <%Mornaka> It's not Pat's fault he has long, itchy nuts
[3:33:20] <PKLoveLucas> but SPOILS
[3:33:24] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I can't believe schlorpy moved all the way to his ankles
[3:33:24] <DemonicHoward> maybe dont read all of those
[3:33:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> Do the patch notes spoil?
[3:33:27] <%ColonelRozum> @chronoxgp are you insane lol ? its an orignal xbox game we just never got it it was jap text only
[3:33:30] <StromkoPenguin> I don't know how many times he has to explain it, his legs are short, you think he's scratching sack and it's actually ankle.
[3:33:33] <+ultracoolboy7> sleep till the end of the world
[3:33:34] <+yeeyeyee> why are you reading it
[3:33:48] <+Scevda> Lame, It sounds like just made it easier without needing to since he figured it out without the hel
[3:33:48] <%foreverN2dust> patchspoilers in there?
[3:33:52] <chambatron> @AngriestPat DON'T READ ALL OF THEM SPOILERS
[3:33:54] <+Jigen> pat is legally required to read pat-ch notes
[3:33:55] <HeadsHeldHigh> luckily this is stuff pat SHOULD already know about
[3:33:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> SPOILERS
[3:34:01] <chronoxgp> From Software presents... METAL WOLF CHAOS XD
[3:34:01] <%foreverN2dust> @AngriestPat SPOILERS
[3:34:05] <%ElenaManetta> Pat's discovered like 80% of the game
[3:34:05] <Deekman> Duck. Maybe I’ll redownload
[3:34:07] <+ultracoolboy7> SPOILERS
[3:34:07] <tnhotpocket> Show Microwave
[3:34:10] <+ultracoolboy7> lol
[3:34:11] <+yeeyeyee> BIG stumbo
[3:34:12] <glaciusinfinite> PAT PATCH SPOILERS
[3:34:12] <Tisaric> you got the gist of it
[3:34:13] <Futurecity10> Fuck, pats not done with brittlehallow yet
[3:34:18] <chambatron> Lol ok haha
[3:34:19] <%RubberFistFight> @HeadsHeldHigh he didn't know about the high energy lab, but now he does i guess.
[3:34:19] <FutaSnek> SAVED
[3:34:20] <Futurecity10> uuuuuuuuugh
[3:34:21] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> how could you spoil through the patch notes, elena
[3:34:21] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah I think you read mostly harmless ones
[3:34:22] <zedravan> Stumbo
[3:34:26] <%RupanSen> FUCK they nerfed the shotgun
[3:34:29] <aimlesshealer> Elena how could you
[3:34:30] <+Jigen> Screen fades into wooden cart
[3:34:31] <Tisaric> it's not really big spoilers
[3:34:35] <+Jigen> ELDER SCROLLS V
[3:34:36] <+QwertyThePie> They phrase the patch notes so there's not really any important spoilers
[3:34:37] <+QwertyThePie> They're very vague
[3:34:38] <%ElenaManetta> I mean, what else are they gonna say
[3:34:39] <%Frost_Quill> He's heard about the energy lab.
[3:34:39] <kane21601> @RubberFistFight actually hes already seen mentions of the lab
[3:34:40] <+Despera__> @RubberFistFight its not like he knows what the lab actually is
[3:34:41] <Tisaric> it's just stuff you should see yourself
[3:34:43] <chambatron> There are things you might have not discovered which were tweeked
[3:34:45] <LodiFrostbeard> @Futurecity10 he's only done withgiant's deep
[3:34:47] <%ElenaManetta> "The blue building ix now fixed?
[3:34:47] <Deekman> I hope they changed the sun to Pats face
[3:34:48] <%galaxyswirl> remember pat, you still havent 100% any planet yet probably
[3:34:52] <%bakiinthedemon> How do you even explain changes without spoiling things in this game?
[3:34:53] <%SirGO0SE> this game is impressive on so many levels. i swear if this doesnt get the recognition it deserves im making an angry youtube rant
[3:34:54] <+Despera__> Yeah there wasn't any spoils in what he read
[3:35:01] <bloodypurpledog> They patched it so you can survive the destroy ending
[3:35:01] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat Ohhhh, then apologies, I may have been afk when you figured that out. My bad.
[3:35:01] <tanarath> Pat, you really need to find a good shortcut to the city.
[3:35:02] <Deekman> Yeah you can
[3:35:13] <%ElenaManetta> I thought Giant's Deep
[3:35:15] <HeadsHeldHigh> Wow thats neat
[3:35:15] <Louie_Salmon> @galaxyswirl I think he is 100% on Giants deep and timber hearth
[3:35:16] <Tisaric> I just really hope that when it launches on Steam it gets a huge boost
[3:35:25] <%ElenaManetta> thats cool
[3:35:25] <Futurecity10> Timber hearth and giants deep are done I think
[3:35:25] <Deekman> Hearth. Like Heart
[3:35:29] <%MagickBurritoh> 20 seconds WASTED
[3:35:30] <Thepenguinking1> hi chat
[3:35:30] <HeadsHeldHigh> wait
[3:35:32] <%starotter70> And now, I'll die
[3:35:33] <Thepenguinking1> hi pat
[3:35:34] <rumuloh> I can't beleive they didn't patch out the Red/blue deck, the cardgame meta is still fucked in this game it seems
[3:35:40] <%SolverCODO> that's gonna be VERY useful for beating the game
[3:35:42] <+Bluemanzee> Gotta restart can't waste those 10 seconds Kappa
[3:35:44] <+QwertyThePie> @rumuloh You appear to be on the wrong stream
[3:35:45] <kane21601> SHIT, wasted 20 seconds, time to DIE
[3:35:46] <PKLoveLucas> JESUS THAT MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE PLAYABLE
[3:35:46] <HeadsHeldHigh> LUL
[3:35:54] <aimlesshealer> Are there two pronunciations of hearth or is this another "steed" situation?
[3:35:57] <+Jigen> -20 on this speedrun section
[3:36:03] <%RubberFistFight> @rumuloh and why'd they add pocket racing for? And locking that important thing behind it, no less.
[3:36:08] <Deekman> No it’s hearth like a fireplace hearth
[3:36:10] <Tisaric> I think it's just better breadcrumbing yeah @AngriestPat
[3:36:12] <rumuloh> @QwertyThePie Oh shit, he hasn't gotten there yet? sorry
[3:36:24] <mrvidicus> Horse Armor patch when.
[3:36:25] <+JM_FUNK> I was expecting Final Fantasy 7
[3:36:30] <%SolverCODO> There is another signal to find in the bramble @AngriestPat
[3:36:30] <+QwertyThePie> @rumuloh I've 100%ed this game and I still have no idea what you're talking about
[3:36:31] <Louie_Salmon> From the sound of it, it's just wording things slightly different for better hints
[3:36:42] <+yeeyeyee> wow yeah every change in this patch gameplay-wise makes it a lot better
[3:36:47] <%RubberFistFight> @QwertyThePie I think he's being tongue-in-cheek
[3:36:47] <Zombrocom> @QwertyThePie I am 99% sure he is making jokes dude
[3:36:48] <+yeeyeyee> this game is literally perfect now
[3:36:52] <rumuloh> @RubberFistFight Pocket racing was fine, the sumo wrestling mini-game felt tacked on though
[3:36:52] <+QwertyThePie> That makes sense
[3:36:52] <+Jigen> Look at this expert backwards long thrust into atmosphere clip, propelling him back into a competitive speedrun time
[3:36:54] <%BioApple> shit maybe I can actually finish this off now
[3:36:59] <Deekman> @yeeyeyee it truly is
[3:37:00] <Choziro> is game still hard locked at 60fps?
[3:37:05] <%Gray_skies1993> now I see why he patched it now
[3:37:09] <ComptonRiot> I can't wait to find out what the specific changes were
[3:37:13] <%RupanSen> back into the Woolie Hole we go
[3:37:15] <%bakiinthedemon> Some of the later puzzles are pretty obscure to get to locations and they supposedly made it more clear
[3:37:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> turn on the scope
[3:37:16] <HeadsHeldHigh> into the plant anus
[3:37:19] <+Grayhammatter> oh wow
[3:37:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> s p e e d
[3:37:26] <FutaSnek> Isnt it funny they patched it just as we hit it the first time
[3:37:27] <+AWr00tBear> Take the short cut
[3:37:28] <+QwertyThePie> There's a list of the specific changes on the website if anyone in chat wants more details
[3:37:29] <Tisaric> that's super nice
[3:37:32] <ComptonRiot> holy shit that's great
[3:37:39] <Tisaric> the red area was hell because of how slow you went
[3:37:41] <%RubberFistFight> @rumuloh yeah that felt a little bit like a big lipped alligator moment. Especially when Solanum summons the sun and then suplexes you, what exactly are you meant to do with that
[3:37:48] <kane21601> oh my god thats a good change
[3:37:52] <Louie_Salmon> Wow that is an upsetting sound
[3:37:53] <aimlesshealer> But it was so suspenseful before, I kinda liked it
[3:38:02] <Scrub_Seeker> its nice until you fire yourself directly into a fish
[3:38:12] <+Scevda> Samw @aimlesshealer
[3:38:12] <Tisaric> I think it'll still be suspenseful but it was just really long
[3:38:25] <rumuloh> @RubberFistFight spolier, you have the bring the gun from the duel with Juan, you just shoot him
[3:38:31] <zedravan> it might be blocked
[3:38:31] <%ElenaManetta> uh
[3:38:32] <Louie_Salmon> @aimlesshealer I mean, it's still ideal to go slow, just makes area transition faster
[3:38:33] <+Grayhammatter> monkaS
[3:38:35] <DemonicHoward> is that the core?
[3:38:36] <+yeeyeyee> very large plant
[3:38:39] <%yoshkosh20> that's the kinda sound that makes me think "deep sea monster"
[3:38:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> its in here
[3:38:43] <+yeeyeyee> there's fog pat
[3:38:45] <Futurecity10> fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck this
[3:38:46] <garbageheaphound> i fell so much anxiety
[3:38:46] <HeadsHeldHigh> hmmmmm
[3:38:49] <Futurecity10> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[3:38:51] <kane21601> too much fog
[3:38:54] <Tisaric> the fog is very heavy
[3:38:55] <%Kilagn> Kilagn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! The stream baby grows stronger. I can feel it kicking and I have a craving to tell others to subscribe to AngriestPat with Twitch Prime™.
[3:38:59] <%starotter70> Well, this is nice
[3:38:59] <murrythebrawn> you are......dundundun
[3:39:03] <Clyderso> I love this song
[3:39:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> in thorns
[3:39:04] <%kiiiirsten> Too deep into the woolie hole
[3:39:05] <+Grayhammatter> heavy fog pat
[3:39:05] <kane21601> 7.8/ 10 too much fog
[3:39:05] <+QwertyThePie> @RubberFistFight Oh, you got that ending? I got the one where Solanum was actually an anglerfish inside the suit
[3:39:13] <+Grayhammatter> like fog of war
[3:39:20] <mrvidicus> What the fuck is this donation-notification gif.
[3:39:20] <%yoshkosh20> that's either the sun. or a single red eye, staring at you.
[3:39:20] <+Deathtronhammer> Thar she blows
[3:39:21] <%Mornaka> wow, they hooked it
[3:39:25] <%starotter70> Fog doesn't exist in Canada
[3:39:26] <%ElenaManetta> Did Pat put his suit on
[3:39:27] <zedravan> this guys got fucked
[3:39:28] <+ShortThrowDipstick> Looks like a deep sea loaf
[3:39:28] <%RubberFistFight> @QwertyThePie I got the one where Majima was on the moon. That fucker.
[3:39:28] <%ElenaManetta> I looked away
[3:39:32] <transporterthesequel> Remarkably intact!
[3:39:32] <Tisaric> oh man this final act is so fucking good
[3:39:32] <+Grayhammatter> nailed it
[3:39:32] <%kiiiirsten> LUL
[3:39:34] <%ElenaManetta> Ya
[3:39:36] <%bakiinthedemon> No gravity to land pat
[3:39:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You guys are forgetting the ending where Sola takes off her helmet and reveals herself to be an adorable catgirl with glasses
[3:39:41] <%waltzqueen> woop
[3:39:52] <%RubberFistFight> @GarbageQueenEllie Solanyan
[3:40:05] <%king_wragles> I can't believe you have to dab Sola to death or else they shoot you.
[3:40:06] <HeadsHeldHigh> here we go chat...
[3:40:07] <+yeeyeyee> you did it, you found the nomai
[3:40:12] <+QwertyThePie> I don't think the Solanyan ending is canon
[3:40:13] <%BioApple> @RubberFistFight I got to the Eye of the Universe but I wasn't fast enough and Feldspar was already there default dancing on me
[3:40:18] <ComptonRiot> page numbers! that's part of the patch
[3:40:19] <ScreamLord> This isn't creepy at all
[3:40:22] <+QwertyThePie> Feldspar would
[3:40:23] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @GarbageQueenEllie @RubberFistFight get out PunOko 👉
[3:40:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> NEVAH
[3:40:37] <%RubberFistFight> @Sphincter_Spelunker shut up you love me :P
[3:40:42] <Meekest> Imagine crashing here of all places
[3:40:54] <roofkie> @AngriestPat i think you'll like this, i bought catnipp spray for my new cat, but i didn't know the russian word for it, so i had to tell my parents its like narcotics but for cats
[3:41:08] <Tisaric> BibleThump
[3:41:11] <HeadsHeldHigh> :(
[3:41:17] <+Grayhammatter> no exit pod
[3:41:20] <+BurncoatRapscallion> How far is he I just got here
[3:41:21] <%waltzqueen> BibleThump they all died
[3:41:23] <mrvidicus> "Do not exit the pod," what the fuck do you do then
[3:41:27] <a_mad_dragon> there's shit out there IN SPACE
[3:41:30] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Oh he's in Dark Brambler
[3:41:33] <+QwertyThePie> @BurncoatRapscallion He's looking for the vessel, he already found Solanum
[3:41:57] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> yeet
[3:41:57] <LodiFrostbeard> @BurncoatRapscallion you're gonna need to watch the vod, lots of progress tonight
[3:42:00] <%RubberFistFight> @BurncoatRapscallion he's actually in the final third of the game. He met living Solanum at the Sixth Location just before, and his brain visibly exploded
[3:42:00] <aimlesshealer> Pchoooooooo
[3:42:00] <%MagickBurritoh> wow
[3:42:00] <%ElenaManetta> There it goes
[3:42:01] <+ZoltanBMagnus> travel with your ship

[3:42:09] <%starotter70> Not again
[3:42:11] <Tisaric> these setpieces are so fucking good
[3:42:12] <+QwertyThePie> Only way to really know what he has and hasn't done is to check out the ship log next time he opens it

[3:45:32] <Mr_Rakjo> WHY DID YOU SLOWD DOWN
[3:45:33] <%BioApple> the game fixed that area so pat had to manually un-fix it
[3:45:33] <JumbleJams> you thrusted
[3:45:33] <%SolverCODO> that part is super fucking hard, you can use the engine at all
[3:45:34] <%Puhff> DON"T LIKE THAT
[3:45:35] <+AlMiRajGaming> they made that scarier!
[3:45:35] <al0nem0nster> welp that's for firing thrusters near the blind space fish.

[3:45:36] <%goose_attack_almanac> I got big spooked
[3:45:37] <+Shaggnar> Pat, they're blind, they can sense your engines! Just glide past them!
[3:45:39] <+SammyOVision> Pat it's not the motion that makes noise! It's the thruster sound!
[3:45:40] <tanarath> Maybe don't slow down. Gotta SNEAK.
[3:45:40] <%MagickBurritoh> Why'd you slow down?
[3:45:40] <glaciusinfinite> pat...

[3:45:44] <Vlesh> Yeah they blind man, just coast
[3:45:45] <PKLoveLucas> the ship is smaller than you think, you can drift between their lure and their body
[3:45:45] <LodiFrostbeard> NO USE THRUSTER DUMMY
[3:45:45] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I thought you had to slow down
[3:45:46] <tanarath> This is a sneaking mission.
[3:45:48] <TimetodiveLTX> kowai as fuck
[3:45:50] <+ShortThrowDipstick> Looks like my ex before makeup
[3:45:51] <%Frost_Quill> Pat why did you do that.
[3:45:52] <+TheSaintJohn> do you like that?
[3:45:53] <Futurecity10> That would have KILLED paige
[3:45:53] <a_mad_dragon> pat's worst enemy, the anglerfish
[3:45:53] <SweepTheLegoMyEggo> *external screaming*
[3:45:55] <FutaSnek> FUCKING FUCK
[3:45:56] <+yeeyeyee> this game's alternate title is Don't Shit Your Pants
[3:46:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> coast as much as you can
[3:46:02] <Frostydough> Baba didn't like that
[3:46:07] <%kiiiirsten> Failed: You shit your pants
[3:46:07] <Koosahmii> I think you’re meant to ditch your ship
[3:46:08] <%SolverCODO> Yeah get a lot of momentum right in the center of the opening and coast through
[3:46:10] <JumbleJams> WutFace
[3:46:10] <jaylabrando> Big scurred
[3:46:14] <transporterthesequel> Yeah you gotta go place the beacon again
[3:46:15] <%Bane_Kaikyo> that scared mee, and by proxy scared the cat in my lap :O
[3:46:16] <Ion_Laser> [My bowels will remember that]
[3:46:19] <+Shaggnar> Remember, you keep momentum in space
[3:46:21] <Reanimator83> That woke me up from my sleep. Damn you Pat
[3:46:22] <kane21601> the good news is you can just mark it
[3:46:22] <hntronium> more to explore?
[3:46:23] <+yeeyeyee> you gotta go back anyway
[3:46:23] <+QwertyThePie> You can show the nomai grave location on your hud if you want to go back there more quickly
[3:46:25] <Psyramics> gotta go back anyway to set a beacon
[3:46:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> didn't get the signalscope
[3:46:29] <roofkie> does everyone really like this art style? it looks more like new vegas when the textures don't load in
[3:46:33] <mrvidicus> Amnesia mildly annoyed me. Slenderman games were funny. Resident Evil, I approached like a strategy game. But this shit? This shit fucking scares me.
[3:46:34] <%salty_syd913> LUL
[3:46:34] <Ner234> LUL
[3:46:35] <hntronium> lol
[3:46:35] <%ElenaManetta> HAHAHA
[3:46:36] <%Takreth> rip the kids
[3:46:38] <Vlesh> I'm worried, Pat
[3:46:38] <Futurecity10> You just smashed a child
[3:46:38] <%Estuko> Everyone on the planet: MonkaS !!!
[3:46:40] <kane21601> @AngriestPat might wanna just mark the grave from the log
[3:46:40] <%Mornaka> @doc_ock_rokc he did for the pod
[3:46:40] <%Artimadare> I am FULL of WORRY
[3:46:40] <+yeeyeyee> @doc_ock_rokc he did
[3:46:41] <%Estuko> monkaS
[3:46:42] <%ShichiNoBushi> Conviently you have to go there again to send your probe through.
[3:46:43] <%SolverCODO> when you're that close ANY engine use sets them off
[3:46:45] <%ElenaManetta> Look at your map mid flight idiot
[3:46:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> I'm worried about it now because you told me not to worry
[3:46:48] <Shastafield> fuck them kids
[3:46:50] <%GarbageQueenEllie> The only thing that would make this worse from Paige's perepective is if she were drunk playing it. Some *major* bends
[3:46:51] <Jack_of_No_Trades> I am terrified of Pats flying. I wanna watch him play a flight simulator
[3:46:53] <%MagickBurritoh> Dun
[3:46:56] <Thepenguinking1> Have you found the music man?
[3:46:56] <%MagickBurritoh> Sun
[3:47:06] <%ElenaManetta> You're the dad who pulls out his map while he's driving
[3:47:08] <+BurncoatRapscallion> I didn't know you could do that
[3:47:11] <npsmh> Oh cool no mans sky got another update
[3:47:11] <%SolverCODO> shit, i never used that feature
[3:47:15] <%bakiinthedemon> Pat can it be classified as manslaughter if someone watching the stream has a heart attack due to a jumpscare because fuck man
[3:47:15] <+Scevda> Has he attempted a sun-shot?
[3:47:17] <+QwertyThePie> A lot of people didn't know you could do that, but it's a nice feature
[3:47:17] <mrvidicus> What was it like when Woolie did the bramble with his directional problems?
[3:47:19] <%Reveresao> How can this be! NotLikeThis
[3:47:26] <+QwertyThePie> @Scevda Not intentionally
[3:47:29] <%RubberFistFight> @ElenaManetta Just slaps it over the steering wheel and stops looking at the road
[3:47:29] <%cureneckbeard> Pat did play a flight simulator: Ace Combat 7. It's where the apatJPG emote comes from
[3:47:32] <+QwertyThePie> He did ram into the sun station earlier, but it was definitely an accident
[3:47:33] <Vlesh> @npsmh Well the Beyond update that gives VR to No Man's Sky is on the 12th
[3:47:35] <+QwertyThePie> And he did not survive
[3:47:38] <+Scevda> @qwertythepie lol
[3:47:38] <EuropanLamprey> Woolie died almost immedietly and went elsewhere
[3:47:41] <KnightReis> woolie went through a hot ass landing
[3:47:41] <%starotter70> apatJpeg
[3:47:44] <al0nem0nster> He's shot into the sun if that counts.
[3:47:46] <3xgilly> smack that eject button
[3:47:58] <DemonicHoward> hey guys is there a reward for finding the two kids
[3:47:58] <%ElenaManetta> Does Pat use the "roll" function at all?
[3:47:59] <+yeeyeyee> did they debuff anglerfish
[3:48:01] <Thepenguinking1> woolie had a existential crisis playing this game
[3:48:06] <+gutlesscoward> I like how this world-destroying bramble is just kind of a tragic oddity compared to the supernovas
[3:48:08] <+QwertyThePie> The roll function isn't usually all that useful
[3:48:09] <%SolverCODO> the length of time you hold the jets doesnt matter, only the intensity
[3:48:12] <+yeeyeyee> i feel like they're way sweaker now
[3:48:13] <%cureneckbeard> but woolie can't is you
[3:48:16] <%RubberFistFight> @ElenaManetta yeah he did a bunch in the last episode
[3:48:20] <%SolverCODO> Big bursts really fast will get you killed
[3:48:21] <+Grayhammatter> now, back to the egg palace
[3:48:28] <ScreamLord> Fuck then Cthulu tree shit
[3:48:33] <%ElenaManetta> your cough scared me
[3:48:35] <+QwertyThePie> @gutlesscoward Not just one supernova, the entire universe is dying
[3:48:36] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> bless you
[3:48:37] <%Estuko> @AngriestPat just Royal Guard the fucking monsters then use the i-frames to get through, EZ
[3:48:38] <%kiiiirsten> WutFace
[3:48:44] <%kiiiirsten> No more jumpscares pls
[3:48:45] <%starotter70> Don't die Pay
[3:48:47] <%MagickBurritoh> Pat don't jumpscare us with coughs
[3:48:47] <DemonicHoward> pat remember your ship has probe
[3:48:49] <%starotter70> Pay?
[3:48:53] <%starotter70> Pat
[3:48:56] <%Artimadare> If the anglers are territorial, why were there, like, 50
[3:48:58] <roofkie> the name nomai reminds me warframe naming stuff for some reason
[3:48:58] <+QwertyThePie> Your probe can take pictures
[3:48:59] <%RubberFistFight> Luckily space has inertia, and your momentum is preserved in a vacuum, so you don't need to move under constant thrust.
[3:49:01] <%kiiiirsten> bonk
[3:49:06] <%GarbageQueenEllie> What up party peeps? Oh... ooooh.

[3:50:53] <+Virokwet> what
[3:50:54] <$SweetCheeksTrap> it doesn't need to make noise
[3:50:55] <+yeeyeyee> the probe makes noise when it snaps a picture
[3:50:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Pour some fuel out for the dead homies
[3:51:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @MagickBurritoh apparently not
[3:51:13] <roofkie> is the ship supposed to look cobbled together?
[3:51:16] <%Aerkk> Oh wow Pat is missing a bunch of stuff to go explore later
[3:51:18] <mrvidicus> Too bad you can't bring their bodies onboard your ship and bury them.
[3:51:28] <+QwertyThePie> It means it's marked on your hud
[3:51:32] <$SweetCheeksTrap> it's the seed dingus
[3:51:33] <InsomniacPersona> you marked it on your map
[3:51:33] <DemonicHoward> tracking
[3:51:37] <%SolverCODO> that is rough, suffocating to death with your loved ones, all holding each other
[3:51:38] <+QwertyThePie> Not missing anything here
[3:51:41] <%Aerkk> Yeah everything with a question mark, not in this area Pat
[3:51:43] <%Estuko> @mrvidicus was thinking that exactly, did that in xcom2, was difficult but I spent extra time to do
[3:51:46] <Louie_Salmon> @roofkie It's literally made of wood and stolen bullshit tied together
[3:51:46] <Dugy123> Nope, your fine

[3:53:01] <+SammyOVision> Pass the egg palace, now just keep light thurst
[3:53:04] <garbageheaphound> DONT RISK IT
[3:53:08] <+yeeyeyee> okay it's fine
[3:53:09] <+dtd63> if you cant hear breathing its safe
[3:53:13] <PKLoveLucas> once you can't hear the breathing, you're fine
[3:53:14] <$SweetCheeksTrap> now PUNCH IT
[3:53:14] <+emperri> is an egg palace like a mind palace
[3:53:16] <kane21601> light thrust is ok
[3:53:16] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Purge the offspring of these mistakes.
[3:53:17] <%RupanSen> Egg Capsule Hotel
[3:53:18] <mrvidicus> Was this composed by the same guy that did Limbo and Inside?
[3:53:22] <%ElenaManetta> So what are the eggs for!? DECORATION?
[3:53:23] <%Agami23> go full speed into the eggs to fuck them up
[3:53:33] <Reanimator83> Ramming Speed!!!
[3:53:34] <+yeeyeyee> why don't the ships have guns
[3:53:35] <Tisaric> man the music is so perfect here
[3:53:37] <+QwertyThePie> @Agami23 Don't worry, the eggs will die when the solar system does
[3:53:38] <%Aerkk> BONK
[3:53:40] <+yeeyeyee> put a big gun on the ship
[3:53:40] <Dugy123> Well played pat, you... did it
[3:53:43] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> eggs are for fertilizing
[3:53:44] <Aephol> you did it
[3:53:45] <+Grayhammatter> ramming speed
[3:53:46] <%Aerkk> You did it
[3:53:51] <%MagickBurritoh> yellow now
[3:53:51] <Tisaric> it's safe here I belevei
[3:53:51] <%Aerkk> Pat the big hero
[3:53:52] <Dugy123> Safe
[3:53:52] <%starotter70> Oh boy
[3:53:53] <Calek> goodness gracious
[3:53:53] <%Reveresao> no fish here
[3:53:54] <Manjove> thar she blows
[3:53:58] <%Agami23> @QwertyThePie thats not soon enough
[3:54:00] <%starotter70> oooooooh
[3:54:01] <Jetsfantasy> Fuse with the egg, the ship will be the sperm
[3:54:01] <+Grayhammatter> wow, that ship is huge
[3:54:01] <mrvidicus> Everything leads back to Cthulhu.
[3:54:03] <+SammyOVision> Here it is, the vessel
[3:54:05] <%Gray_skies1993> NO WAY
[3:54:06] <%Aerkk> A new-clear Wessel
[3:54:10] <%ElenaManetta> This seed fucked up everyone
[3:54:10] <%Gray_skies1993> that's dope
[3:54:11] <+emperri> only on Vessel
[3:54:11] <+yeeyeyee> dead nomai storage
[3:54:12] <%MagickBurritoh> Music
[3:54:13] <Aephol> God this music is so gooood
[3:54:15] <T3merity> the WESSEL
[3:54:16] <+BurncoatRapscallion> The Wessel
[3:54:21] <Shastafield> PogChamp
[3:54:22] <Louie_Salmon> God this game has music exactly when it needs to
[3:54:23] <Frostydough> that looks like a star trek
[3:54:26] <%RubberFistFight> Get outta here Chekov
[3:54:29] <Tisaric> big as fuck spaceship checkmark
[3:54:31] <DemonicHoward> why does it look relativity small next to the escape pods
[3:54:32] <%Reveresao> misses entrance NotLikeThis
[3:54:33] <+emperri> isn't that the sun explode music
[3:54:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> where did the seed come from? Them?
[3:54:36] <jaylabrando> Kappa
[3:54:37] <+Veenok> Man I love this game's music
[3:54:38] <AtisutoCurry> dang, this reminds me of Titan A.E.
[3:54:42] <%crimsonharvest> this calls for a dab of shatter
[3:54:43] <%Mornaka> @emperri nope
[3:54:48] <gamewarden92> @doc_ock_rokc No, they just crashed into it.
[3:54:50] <+OkamiDude15> sounded like modern crusaders was about to play
[3:54:51] <%kiiiirsten> Ah yes
[3:54:54] <%TheLakinessMonster> fuel refil
[3:54:55] <KingVantq> @DemonicHoward alot probably broke off
[3:54:55] <%RubberFistFight> @AtisutoCurry man that movie was fucking awesome
[3:54:55] <roofkie> yeah, good music the 5 times you can hear it
[3:54:55] <+emperri> buckle up, homestuck
[3:54:59] <mrvidicus> Man. This game exists. And then Anthem exists. Wtf.
[3:55:09] <Tisaric> It was a Vessel
[3:55:09] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> you're odd
[3:55:13] <HeadsHeldHigh> entrance near your scout
[3:55:17] <+yeeyeyee> i wonder if pat will take longer than i did to get into the ship
[3:55:17] <kane21601> this game has some incredible music, and its made even better in that each track is used in the absolute perfect situation for it
[3:55:18] <%ElenaManetta> 0.0 gravity, still fall and take damage, kiss my ass
[3:55:20] <AtisutoCurry> @RubberFistFight Had some of the best OST
[3:55:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @mrvidicus and you can buy anthem in better places then this game
[3:55:27] <Dugy123> Scout is at the entrance
[3:55:28] <%MagickBurritoh> hull hole
[3:55:33] <LodiFrostbeard> entrance is hard to find, took me a while
[3:55:36] <Vlesh> Still has power it seems
[3:55:38] <Louie_Salmon> @roofkie Yes, exactly
[3:55:39] <%Mornaka> @ElenaManetta i mean pat had velocity
[3:55:40] <+yeeyeyee> @ElenaManetta ramming fast into something will still crack your visor/skeleton
[3:55:42] <%Aerkk> SKELETONS
[3:55:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You found the Starship Enterprise
[3:55:45] <+OkamiDude15> its more like ramming into something at high speed
[3:55:47] <%Aerkk> 2 spooky 4 me
[3:55:50] <Klarrann3> @ElenaManetta there's no gravity, but momentum still exists
[3:55:50] <+QwertyThePie> Oh hey, more dead kids
[3:55:50] <+Grayhammatter> oh wow
[3:55:52] <+emperri> paige came
[3:55:52] <%MagickBurritoh> It's BIG
[3:55:53] <%Keyd00d> apatSkelmoney
[3:55:54] <+Shaggnar> F
[3:55:55] <%kiiiirsten> Don't give up, skeleton!
[3:55:56] <mrvidicus> @doc_ock_rokc Mannnnnnnnnnnnnnn, we live in a time where the Origin store is the better store what the fuck.
[3:55:56] <Nina96> dont call paige
[3:55:56] <shiny_prinny> don't tell paige
[3:55:56] <Shastafield> WutFace
[3:55:57] <%RubberFistFight> @AtisutoCurry that song that plays when they're flying the ship through those glowing clouds Kreygasm
[3:55:57] <%starotter70> oh shit
[3:55:58] <+gutlesscoward> mama mia, that's-a lotta skeletons
[3:55:58] <TimetodiveLTX> f
[3:56:00] <+Tokanova> they weren't even in space suits
[3:56:01] <%GarbageQueenEllie> They never saw it coming
[3:56:01] <a_mad_dragon> SPACE SKELETONS
[3:56:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> MANY DEAD CHILDREN
[3:56:04] <%ElenaManetta> This is just a Star Trek setpiece
[3:56:07] <Frostydough> paige would be so happy at this scene
[3:56:09] <+yeeyeyee> SPACE trees
[3:56:12] <Tisaric> This ship is so fucking cool to find
[3:56:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @mrvidicus sometimes the univers is fucked up
[3:56:19] <%crimsonharvest> This is what happens in Stellaris when your science ships go missing
[3:56:23] <%RubberFistFight> @AtisutoCurry found the band Switchfoot because of that movie.
[3:56:34] <%galaxyswirl> PUZZLE
[3:56:37] <%Aerkk> Precious Lore Panels
[3:56:41] <gamewarden92> This is what happens when you don't give your ship weapons.
[3:56:49] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:57:01] <Shastafield> this looks like alien
[3:57:05] <%MelBrooksKA> Something went wrong? You don't say
[3:57:15] <%GarbageQueenEllie> But nobody came.
[3:57:16] <+SammyOVision> Outgoing communications were lost
[3:57:18] <%ElenaManetta> Meanwhile, Feldspar chose to live here. What a badass, I think.
[3:57:18] <%waltzqueen> BibleThump
[3:57:27] <+MellowMute> monkaS
[3:57:33] <AtisutoCurry> @RubberFistFight oh! thats "Its my Turn to Fly" by The Urge I believe
[3:57:38] <%Aerkk> Feldspar had treeds and infinite marshmallows
[3:57:39] <mrvidicus> "The universe is dying," is the most terrifying fucking sentence ever.
[3:57:40] <Louie_Salmon> Well there's your problem, you're writing on the wall instead of using the radio, silly
[3:57:43] <roofkie> lol wow really, there are bots that tell you to drink water?
[3:57:45] <Jetsfantasy> monkaS
[3:57:46] <%Tennochief> that's depressing
[3:57:49] <+yeeyeyee> HEAT DEATH has joined the server
[3:57:55] <%crimsonharvest> Last I read the real universe's estimated lifespan would be about 100 billion years
[3:57:55] <%cureneckbeard> F
[3:58:04] <%This_is_Marco> Entropy is the final boss
[3:58:19] <mrvidicus> But it -can- be beat.
[3:58:20] <+yeeyeyee> imagine how fucked this is
[3:58:22] <%dalmek> you're ON Escall's vessel
[3:58:26] <%GarbageQueenEllie> At least it's somewhat comforting to know you're going to die waaay before any of that happens
[3:58:28] <%RupanSen> Entropy will defeat global warming
[3:58:30] <%BioApple> if only the nomai had discovered Spiral Energy
[3:58:32] <+yeeyeyee> this happened SO LONG AGO that this event has PASSED INTO MYTH
[3:58:39] <+yeeyeyee> people DON'T EVEN BELIEVE THIS REALLY HAPPENED anymore
[3:58:40] <%wsintai> Could Gold Experience Requiem defeat the Heat Death of the Universe?
[3:58:43] <roofkie> plot twist, the warp is actually from warhammer 40k
[3:58:57] <+SammyOVision> That's really sad, this is incoming communication LONG after this crashed, they never actually got the outgoing communications working, so noone ever actually responded to them
[3:59:14] <mrvidicus> Trick to beating entropy is to learn how to make a universe in the universe that will keep expanding inside the empty space of the old universe.
[3:59:15] <+Tokanova> star machine broke
[3:59:16] <%MagickBurritoh> That's dire
[3:59:16] <mrvidicus> Y'know. simple shit.
[3:59:20] <%Aerkk> The Universe is Dying Cloud!
[3:59:24] <Deekman> Plot twist. The entire galaxy is on the line
[3:59:28] <%king_wragles> HUH, that's uh.... REAL NEAT TO KNOW

[3:59:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> do a barrel roll

[4:10:20] <SpiritusNox> ABORT AUTOPILOT
[4:10:24] <%king_wragles> \[T]/
[4:10:24] <mrvidicus> "We're not going to make it-" "Well make it."
[4:10:27] <TetsujinTiger7> tomatoDry
[4:10:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> I always thought it was the brigtness of the sun doing it
[4:10:29] <HeadsHeldHigh> !!!!!!!!!!!
[4:10:30] <%crimsonharvest> Death is certain
[4:10:30] <+OkamiDude15> parry this you fucking casul
[4:10:31] <DemonicHoward> odd that you can outrun a exploading star
[4:10:33] <SpiritusNox> (You can actually super outrun the explosion)
[4:10:33] <%Broand> huh
[4:10:33] <%arancet> ABORT
[4:10:34] <TimetodiveLTX> what
[4:10:35] <MasterDecoder> Linked to Battleborn? Stars are dying
[4:10:36] <Deekman> DRIFT FOREVER ENDING
[4:10:39] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Oh wow that distance is out of the loop
[4:10:39] <StromkoPenguin> Autopilot pushing you directly into the supernova. Boeing would be proud.
[4:10:39] <SpiritusNox> It just gives you a non-standard game over
[4:10:39] <%cureneckbeard> bye sun
[4:10:40] <%king_wragles> @OkamiDude15 LUL
[4:10:40] <%dalmek> you can SEE the other stars go supernova
[4:10:40] <+Saggitori> froze too death
[4:10:41] <crazypieman7> You can abort the autopilot during that, but there's not much practical use to it
[4:10:42] <masterfire23> can't escape from crossing fate
[4:10:44] <+fingalights> it's cold I guess
[4:10:44] <+SammyOVision> That's the end of the memory recording for this timeline
[4:10:48] <%ElenaManetta> You can't outrun the explosion
[4:10:49] <LodiFrostbeard> @DemonicHoward pro tip: you can't
[4:10:54] <%ElenaManetta> It game overs you no matter what distance
[4:10:56] <%SolverCODO> If you look at the night sky and zoom in with your scope you can see them exploding
[4:10:56] <+Scevda> @StromkoPenguin lol
[4:10:58] <%bakiinthedemon> Yes
[4:10:59] <PackysSportsBar> yeah it's pretty subtle
[4:11:02] <%Estuko> @AngriestPat if oyu actually wait a second and leave your ship, you can try to royal guard and use the i-frames to survive the blast.
[4:11:02] <SpiritusNox> Not go out - they pop
[4:11:03] <IHaveNoFunnyName> How long has he been playing?
[4:11:05] <%ElenaManetta> You can see tiny explosions in the distance
[4:11:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Wow ther arelady are some at the start
[4:11:09] <+OkamiDude15> !uptime
[4:11:09] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 14m.
[4:11:10] <Tisaric> yeah with the zoom scope it's really apparenty
[4:11:10] <Manjove> the bright ones are supernova
[4:11:11] <%ElenaManetta> It's easier to spot with your telescope
[4:11:11] <%Frost_Quill> Yeah even here.
[4:11:11] <Naoyin> u can zoom in with the signalscope
[4:11:18] <+fingalights> BANG like fireworks
[4:11:18] <%cureneckbeard> !uptime
[4:11:19] <DemonicHoward> one just went
[4:11:19] <kane21601> @AngriestPat if you use your signalscope and zoom you can see it very clearly
[4:11:20] <+punit216> no wonder chert was freaking out
[4:11:21] <%RubberFistFight> Clock's ticking, dude
[4:11:25] <glaciusinfinite> I JUST SAW ONE BLINK OUT
[4:11:26] <Shastafield> monkaS
[4:11:27] <%SolverCODO> use your scope to zoom in
[4:11:30] <%crimsonharvest> hard to say when a star shimmers out and doesnt come bcak
[4:11:31] <%bakiinthedemon> Time to follow them logs and mop it up
[4:11:32] <alrobot2014> seriously what the fuck is that explosion every time you spawn in?
[4:11:34] <+Scevda> It like reduces across minutes
[4:11:37] <%TheLakinessMonster> How long will the stream stay on for?
[4:11:37] <%SirGO0SE> yes, you must perfect parry the sun
[4:11:38] <alrobot2014> have we learned what that is yet
[4:11:39] <%Frost_Quill> Signalscope it.
[4:11:39] <CrypticMochi> Saw one blink out
[4:11:43] <IHaveNoFunnyName> Considering how much time is spent before playing the game !uptime doesn't actually answer my question :p
[4:11:49] <ComptonRiot> look at the brighter ones
[4:11:49] <Psyramics> @alrobot2014 Watch the VODs
[4:11:50] <+Sestren413> the brighter ones
[4:11:51] <Manjove> the bright ones
[4:11:51] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> red parry the red dwarf
[4:11:52] <+Deathtronhammer> Saw another just die
[4:11:52] <%Reveresao> blue one
[4:11:53] <%SolverCODO> look at the "bigger" stars
[4:11:54] <+Bluemanzee> Not many explosions at the very beginning
[4:11:54] <Tisaric> in the ship
[4:11:54] <%Estuko> @alrobot2014 a ship shooting into space
[4:11:55] <glaciusinfinite> ITS TOTALLY HAPPENING
[4:12:00] <Deekman> Wait until near end of loop
[4:12:01] <tanarath> Did Pat get to the stuff on the Ash Twins?
[4:12:02] <alrobot2014> oh

[4:13:00] <$chubbypencil> kk
[4:13:03] <+Sestren413> maybe just try later
[4:13:05] <%SolverCODO> give it more time, there arent many going off yet
[4:13:07] <%bakiinthedemon> Takes a minute
[4:13:07] <xeros720> they mean towards the end of a loop pat
[4:13:07] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> headshot the sun

[4:15:05] <%Mornaka> wouldn't brittle hollow be faster
[4:15:06] <Psyramics> you're supposed to decelerate at the 50% point
[4:15:10] <Moonlight_Grimoire> .... fucking slingshot
[4:15:12] <Louie_Salmon> And that's what retro-rockets are for.
[4:15:19] <tanarath> Autopilot is aimed at the fucking SUN PAT
[4:15:24] <kane21601> you know i bet if you ram giants deep from here it would actually work

[4:16:04] <%starotter70> is it?
[4:16:05] <tanarath> 3.2 km
[4:16:07] <%galaxyswirl> its not tho
[4:16:08] <Psyramics> gun it for 3 km and then decelerate for 3km
[4:16:08] <%ElenaManetta> Does going at high speed into white hole teleport you?
[4:16:11] <+Sestren413> this is much better thant he easy way
[4:16:11] <TimetodiveLTX> just drift over there
[4:16:12] <%wsintai> @mrvidicus Thats next

[4:16:19] <%RupanSen> use the force Luke
[4:16:19] <%Aerkk> Pat is trying to master space since he has already mastered the oceans and the earth
[4:16:21] <TimetodiveLTX> there's no friction in space

[4:16:32] <%ElenaManetta> That's new
[4:16:35] <%ElenaManetta> It didn't used to do that
[4:16:41] <Psyramics> it shouldn't do that, that makes no sense
[4:16:42] <%starotter70> Pretty sure it did
[4:16:44] <Deekman> Wtf is he missing here?
[4:16:45] <Choziro> its not new
[4:16:47] <chronoxgp> suck it dry
[4:16:47] <Naoyin> it always did that
[4:16:48] <%dalmek> get closer and it'll mess with things more
[4:16:48] <Tisaric> yeah it did for me
[4:16:48] <Louie_Salmon> I'm almost certain it did that before
[4:16:53] <%ElenaManetta> It never did that for me
[4:17:09] <%luckysteak> did he already go to giant's deep with the jellyfish?
[4:17:14] <DemonicHoward> yes
[4:17:18] <%PauliusMaximus> isnt the ship going to float away?

[4:17:36] <%luckysteak> @mankeyfigh Thanks, will have to watch that later
[4:17:38] <%wsintai> @Thepenguinking1 How oddly appropriate
[4:17:38] <+AWr00tBear> Teleport to the sun!
[4:17:39] <tanarath> 'Every warp tower', Pat.
[4:17:42] <%crimsonharvest> Pat this is important is one of the towers attuned to the SUN?
[4:17:44] <Tisaric> oh that's new
[4:17:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Thepenguinking1 That sentence could be applied to a lot of things
[4:17:46] <%Frost_Quill> It updated?
[4:17:47] <ComptonRiot> I think they changed that text slightly
[4:17:47] <+Grayhammatter> a stone?
[4:17:52] <KaliasTV> Patch addition?
[4:17:55] <Deekman> That’s new since patch
[4:17:55] <PKLoveLucas> NEW PATCH TEXT
[4:17:55] <Tisaric> the warp pad looks better
[4:17:55] <+QwertyThePie> That's probably the text that was added in the patch
[4:17:56] <%Frost_Quill> I guess it DOES mark the stuff that changed.
[4:17:57] <ComptonRiot> patch addition I think
[4:18:01] <Deekman> NEW PATCH TEXT
[4:18:02] <%Reveresao> @AngriestPat new info from patch
[4:18:04] <%DukeMoose> !discord
[4:18:12] <Tisaric> The warp pad is so much more distinct now
[4:18:14] <Deekman> Holy shit that’s a great addition
[4:18:15] <Tisaric> that's so nice
[4:18:23] <%galaxyswirl> WAIT THATS THE THING PEOPLE GOT CONFUSED ON???????????????
[4:18:23] <ComptonRiot> that's so good
[4:18:23] <%Aerkk> I love this game a lot
[4:18:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> Is there a warp core to pilfer?

[4:18:28] <mrvidicus> That
[4:18:28] <%galaxyswirl> HOW
[4:18:33] <mrvidicus> That's such a simple but genius fucking airlock.
[4:18:34] <%Aerkk> Very chill yet also thrilling
[4:18:35] <Tisaric> @galaxyswirl it's specifically the one tower
[4:18:37] <LodiFrostbeard> GO INTERLOPER
[4:18:41] <ashuckel> that must mean theres another black hole teleport somewhere
[4:18:41] <a_mad_dragon> what were those other structures
[4:18:42] <Tisaric> @galaxyswirl they also changed it
[4:18:54] <+yeeyeyee> @galaxyswirl they changed like 5 lines of text
[4:19:03] <%ElenaManetta> I don't think he has time to do Interloper unless he wants to end the game at 1AM

[4:23:47] <asurite_warrior> close to dead sun man
[4:23:48] <HollowDragon231> VANILLA ICE
[4:23:48] <$ZE_Count> FUEL!
[4:23:50] <kane21601> its very interesting that the nomai are a very scientific and inquisitive species, yet tend to describe astral bodies as having "wills" (ie, the comet wants to freeze the ship, and the belief the eye called to them)\
[4:23:51] <+Sestren413> descend below surface
[4:23:52] <%crimsonharvest> oh shit can you get inside at perihelion?
[4:23:56] <Tisaric> ice is melting
[4:23:56] <$ZE_Count> GET fuel!
[4:24:03] <%bevyrage> yes perfect timing

[4:24:07] <mrvidicus> Pat. You just gotta warm up to the idea of chilling.
[4:24:09] <thegreenbenis> GET FUEL

[4:24:22] <Aephol> ICEY
[4:24:24] <%RubberFistFight> @mrvidicus polar magnetic inversion is totally a thing, but the effects it's going to have are largely unknown and hypothetical at best. It's happened a bunch of times in Earth's history (the magnetic record in certain minerals has evidence of it) but not while we're around.
[4:24:24] <%arcaderabbit48> Thread a needle the size of the sun

[4:25:16] <%RubberFistFight> @mrvidicus what's scarier is the possibility that during an inversion, the magnetic field might temporarily (for a couple centuries) "switch off", leaving us unprotected from solar wind and cosmic radiation.

[4:26:38] <Deekman> You’re really close tbh
[4:26:39] <$ZE_Count> it take one or two more

[4:26:40] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat hades update made it beatable so you could do that
[4:26:42] <%SirGO0SE> you ever finish RDR2?
[4:26:45] <Tisaric> it's a really good short story to follow, you'll probably not finish too early but it won't be extremely long either
[4:26:46] <Aephol> Sunless city is still pretty huge
[4:26:48] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you won't finish it any time soon. You still have a fair amount to explore.
[4:26:51] <%Aerkk> Did pat also do the High Energy Lab?
[4:26:51] <bloodypurpledog> Play Lego City Undercover
[4:26:55] <%bakiinthedemon> @bevyrage Yeah I know I just wanted to see his reaction lol

[4:27:16] <JumbleJams> yay! eco terrorism! :D
[4:27:19] <mrvidicus> I mean right after you finish this EXISTENTIAL TERROR
[4:27:21] <%Aerkk> @RubberFistFight So like ~12 hours or so left I reckon then
[4:27:23] <DemonicHoward> how about a game not about the death of the universe
[4:27:24] <@lewdskeletor13> Ecoterrorism always brings my spirits up
[4:27:25] <Deekman> you go to space. How much more up do you want
[4:27:26] <%GarbageQueenEllie> FF7 is almost as angsty as ff8 looks
[4:27:26] <%foreverN2dust> Nothing more uplifting that saving the universe
[4:27:28] <%SirGO0SE> something something up lift tifa shirt
[4:27:38] <%vectorless_peon> whats more uplifting than a dying planet he says
[4:27:38] <ashuckel> i was hoping he would crash the sun again
[4:27:39] <$ZE_Count> its cool
[4:27:42] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> All those dead under the pizza slice

[4:28:59] <Tisaric> if only there was a campfire on the comet
[4:29:02] <Deekman> Don’t bother
[4:29:06] <ashuckel> dont bother
[4:29:09] <$ZE_Count> Theres some good info inside that comet
[4:29:13] <alrobot2014> lets hope this time it doesn't get flung into the sun
[4:29:18] <Tisaric> it will
[4:29:21] <alrobot2014> oh
[4:29:24] <ashuckel> the sun will pull the ship away
[4:29:27] <Deekman> This is a reset every time thing
[4:29:40] <mrvidicus> Where's the Pitch Black planet in this game
[4:29:41] <KingVantq> ice
[4:29:42] <LodiFrostbeard> ICE IS SLIPPERY
[4:29:42] <+QwertyThePie> The comet has gravity, yes
[4:29:44] <Tisaric> ice removes the gravity
[4:29:45] <%sourceofall> not gravity, it's hitting you
[4:29:46] <%StripesUltimateEdition> sun has stronger gravity
[4:29:47] <%Yadogari> Pat did you know small things have less gravity?
[4:29:48] <%SolverCODO> ....?
[4:29:49] <AlwaysBeGaming> 5Head
[4:29:50] <tanarath> 0.4x
[4:29:51] <InsomniacPersona> ice is slippery pat
[4:29:54] <$SweetCheeksTrap> OMG guys shut the hell up and let him be surprised when things happen
[4:29:56] <%MagickBurritoh> Gravity is stronger the closer you are to something
[4:29:56] <%SolverCODO> you mean friction?
[4:29:56] <%dekkitout> It makes sense for gravity to be where there'd be more mass
[4:29:56] <%starotter70> apatWhat
[4:29:57] <%Aerkk> @sourceofall thats basically gravity
[4:30:00] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Gravity is negated by proximity to sun
[4:30:01] <KishinGrek> How are you not burning up that close to the sun?
[4:30:07] <%RubberFistFight> There's gravity on its forward-facing point, due to its movement forward
[4:30:14] <%Keyd00d> woop there goes gravity

[4:35:11] <%starotter70> sad music again
[4:35:12] <Vlesh> I love how everything in this game you stumble on just gives off this overwhelming feeling that you shouldn't be there
[4:35:12] <%Tennochief> so many dead

[4:35:27] <+Grayhammatter> F
[4:35:31] <Tisaric> It's Ghost Matter!
[4:35:33] <+LastHazzerd> oh... lore about the ghost mater?
[4:35:34] <%ShichiNoBushi> The source of ghost matter?
[4:35:36] <%Aerkk> Outer Wilds sublimynal
[4:35:40] <%bakiinthedemon> How is this room not just fucked up with ghost matter
[4:35:40] <mrvidicus> Dude. DUDE. Can you IMAGINE being a ghost stuck on a fucking comet?! Your spirit is tied to this physical realm, but you're stuck flying around in space until the universe dies!
[4:35:42] <%RubberFistFight> @Tennochief the entire nomai race, not counting one quantum instance of Solanum out of the six that exist, are dead.
[4:35:45] <KishinGrek> "Disturbing "
[4:35:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> AND THEN THEY BROKE IT
[4:35:57] <%crimsonharvest> necro neutronium lol
[4:36:02] <Deekman> This is why they’re all flash fried skeletons.
[4:36:02] <%chiluzza> ashot it
[4:36:04] <redial_nick> BibleThump
[4:36:05] <+QwertyThePie> Yeah they uh
[4:36:06] <%king_wragles> I think I know why the stars are exploding
[4:36:07] <%beetbo2> ghost matter?
[4:36:08] <%BioApple> man this star system is fucked in all kinds of ways innit
[4:36:08] <+QwertyThePie> didn't make it back to the shuttle
[4:36:09] <thegreenbenis> F
[4:36:09] <shinichizio> That shit didn't work out, huh?
[4:36:10] <+punit216> BibleThump
[4:36:14] <Shastafield> oh
[4:36:17] <Deekman> Every Nomai in the solar system died at once
[4:36:18] <%dalmek> ghost matter killed all the Nomai
[4:36:19] <Mr_Rakjo> Solar System Nuke
[4:36:19] <Aephol> BibleThump Thats how they all died'd
[4:36:19] <%starotter70> BibleThump
[4:36:20] <%arancet> amd its what wiped out the nomai
[4:36:20] <+yeeyeyee> thousands dead
[4:36:22] <+punit216> Rip everyone
[4:36:26] <ssks123> there were multiple nomai clans, so some might still exist somewhere
[4:36:28] <%crimsonharvest> it came from cthulhu
[4:36:29] <%bakiinthedemon> And the shell is cracked open
[4:36:29] <Nina96> touch it
[4:36:30] <al0nem0nster> oh...so comet got close to sun, death ball exploded in ghost matter.
[4:36:33] <+Grayhammatter> exploded rock
[4:36:33] <%SirGO0SE> you heard the man pat
[4:36:33] <Tisaric> destroyed all the nomai
[4:36:35] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> it came from beyond
[4:36:36] <mrvidicus> That's not a rock, that's a fuckin alien. Look at that ribcage.
[4:36:37] <PKLoveLucas> ghost matter evaportes, remember?
[4:36:38] <+QwertyThePie> @ssks123 Some do exist elsewhere, you see their logs in the vessel
[4:36:39] <+yeeyeyee> this dude got it really fucking hard btw
[4:36:40] <VigilantShield> so wait it was a sphere but it doesn't look like one
[4:36:40] <%Maids4lyfe> the comet destroyed the universe
[4:36:41] <$ZE_Count> kinda weird no one got a message out
[4:36:41] <+MellowMute> touch it
[4:36:41] <Moonlight_Grimoire> looks like friggen tiberium
[4:36:42] <%dumemoto> Watch that fuel my man
[4:36:43] <KishinGrek> Can we find a dead space marker?
[4:36:44] <a_mad_dragon> it was a BOMB
[4:36:46] <+LastHazzerd> soooo.... touch?
[4:36:47] <ComptonRiot> this dialogue was changed too to be more specific, I think
[4:36:49] <+SammyOVision> The thing EXPLODED
[4:36:50] <natebud> He's got rocks stuck to his corpse
[4:36:51] <Mr_Rakjo> the comet destroyed the nomai
[4:36:54] <$ZE_Count> Big comet bomb
[4:36:55] <Deekman> 100,000 nomai dead
[4:36:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> They esplobed it real good
[4:36:59] <%SolverCODO> @VigilantShield it was when they found it. it burst
[4:37:08] <%PlainSimpleTailor> The Nomai remind me of those aliens with the huge exo suits from The Fifth Element
[4:37:15] <Frostydough> wheres your sick ass symbiote
[4:37:19] <$ZE_Count> So thats one mystery solved
[4:37:22] <+QwertyThePie> Except for 1/6 of Solanum
[4:37:22] <leerose3755> more like the comet destroyed the universe
[4:37:24] <%Reveresao> @AngriestPat Do you remember the ice carter in the moon?
[4:37:24] <%crimsonharvest> so the comet was ice that accreted around that super dense core
[4:37:25] <Tisaric> excepy your race
[4:37:26] <%foreverN2dust> Damn
[4:37:30] <xeros720> "oops"
[4:37:30] <%Reveresao> on*
[4:37:30] <mrvidicus> So that's how the dwemer disappeared.
[4:37:32] <gamewarden92> Except for the ones with four eyes!
[4:37:33] <%Aerkk> Ghosty
[4:37:34] <Tisaric> your race was fine in the water
[4:37:37] <%Keyd00d> big ghost

[4:37:45] <LodiFrostbeard> YOU DON'T
[4:37:46] <Tisaric> you don't
[4:37:47] <Aephol> die like the nomai
[4:37:47] <%Aerkk> 1 Way Trip

[4:37:52] <PKLoveLucas> death
[4:37:52] <Dugy123> Ded
[4:37:52] <KishinGrek> Uh oh spaghettios
[4:37:54] <%StripesUltimateEdition> touch rock
[4:37:55] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[4:37:55] <Calek> or meditate
[4:37:55] <%bakiinthedemon> Same way you came in
[4:37:55] <%Keyd00d> Die
[4:37:57] <shinichizio> Do a flying punch on the ghost matter, you hero
[4:37:58] <+Grayhammatter> that's fucked
[4:38:00] <+Sestren413> you can, you have to go out the way you came
[4:38:00] <%SirGO0SE> how did they get out?
[4:38:00] <%Oz_Bunny> embrace death
[4:38:01] <mrvidicus> Yeah, you're frozen in mate.
[4:38:01] <%BioApple> i mean you probably can but what's teh point
[4:38:02] <%sourceofall> it froze again
[4:38:02] <Lonely_Desperado> the same way you came in
[4:38:04] <%arkv01> you stay... forever 👻
[4:38:05] <+MellowMute> you die malfSteel
[4:38:05] <%arancet> you CAN get out, but why bother
[4:38:05] <SleepyMaribo> touch the rock
[4:38:05] <%starotter70> Try the ghost matter
[4:38:05] <+TheBitingIrish> The crack you entered through
[4:38:07] <%bevyrage> try that fucked hole
[4:38:07] <%SirGO0SE> theres your answer
[4:38:07] <$ZE_Count> time loop pat
[4:38:07] <%dumemoto> So is there any combat in this game, or is it strictly exploration? Not that there's anything wrong with that.
[4:38:07] <shiny_prinny> see how the ghost kills you i guess
[4:38:07] <%SolverCODO> your ship is gone anyway
[4:38:08] <$El_Desperad0> you can
[4:38:08] <Vlesh> Mortis
[4:38:10] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> ooopsie doo there goes the goo
[4:38:10] <%bevyrage> :3c
[4:38:10] <+LastHazzerd> it really IS an interloper
[4:38:13] <%Reveresao> @AngriestPat the way you came in
[4:38:14] <+Sestren413> its tricky and not really worth it since you use most of the cycle
[4:38:15] <IminyourBase> dig up stupid
[4:38:18] <+taco_flambe> There's an exit in the wall
[4:38:18] <Nina96> NO ESCAPE
[4:38:18] <Calek> @dumemoto strictly exploration
[4:38:19] <ashuckel> only if you backtrack all the way then wait the sun
[4:38:21] <%bevyrage> damn
[4:38:24] <IminyourBase> that wasn't the way you came in stupid
[4:38:24] <+linSP> chat got you good
[4:38:29] <+taco_flambe> nvm
[4:38:30] <$ZE_Count> Thats some cool backstory uh?
[4:38:31] <Tisaric> @dumemoto exploration with botw esque tool mechanics
[4:38:31] <thegreenbenis> Hegot out.
[4:38:31] <Deekman> Now you know what happened to the nomai
[4:38:33] <$El_Desperad0> 3
[4:38:34] <%borkmire> what about the hole you came in?
[4:38:36] <%Reveresao> @AngriestPat do you remember the ice carter on the moon?
[4:38:39] <%salty_syd913> you couldnve gone the same way you went in
[4:38:40] <DemonicHoward> the ship flies off anyways
[4:38:40] <TimetodiveLTX> i wonder what that feels like
[4:38:40] <Thepenguinking1> nice
[4:38:40] <KishinGrek> Did you die?
[4:38:42] <Tisaric> @dumemoto so no combat
[4:38:43] <Deekman> End on a depressing note
[4:38:50] <%SirGO0SE> @borkmire phrasing
[4:38:52] <mrvidicus> "Wake the fuck up, Four Eyes. We've got a universe to burn."
[4:38:53] <%arkv01> you got turned into a death stranding baby
[4:38:54] <Nina96> so is this thing y the sun explodes?
[4:38:54] <+Scevda> Try a sun shot Pat!
[4:38:56] <Dugy123> @reveresao oh shit I never thought of that
[4:38:57] <+yeeyeyee> oh fuck i just realized something but it's a spoiler
[4:38:58] <%dumemoto> Looks great
[4:38:58] <HeadsHeldHigh> i think thats it for the interloper
[4:38:59] <+SammyOVision> Now think about how all those skeletons seeminglu died where they stood.
[4:38:59] <$ZE_Count> Poor three eyed space cats
[4:39:02] <+yeeyeyee> did pat finish the quantum moon?
[4:39:03] <%Reveresao> @AngriestPat moon blocked the shost matter
[4:39:03] <%bevyrage> oh right he still needs to chill with the other ship right
[4:39:11] <+SammyOVision> everyone died SO fast it was instantaneous
[4:39:15] <%Reveresao> @yeeyeyee yes
[4:39:20] <%Kirby_Sauce> Oh he found THAT
[4:39:23] <+SammyOVision> Goat men ded, pat
[4:39:23] <DemonicHoward> F
[4:39:26] <%SolverCODO> That's why everywhere has skeletons often covered in ghost matter, it killed everyone at once
[4:39:28] <Dugy123> Man that’s crazy
[4:39:31] <+yeeyeyee> then solanum is only alive because she was quantumly at all points in the solar system, including the eye which was outside the boundary of the ghost matter
[4:39:39] <%Aerkk> this game is very compelling, each pieoce of the puzzle makes you want to learn the rest of the puzzle
[4:39:40] <%SirGO0SE> ey @Kirby_Sauce :D
[4:39:40] <+yeeyeyee> she's dead at all points where she would have died
[4:39:45] <%Reveresao> @Dugy123 moons a bro
[4:39:50] <Dugy123> So the attalerock protected timber
[4:39:54] <+yeeyeyee> yo that's more fucked than i thought
[4:39:56] <%RubberFistFight> so fun fact, not a spoiler just a neat game fact. All the Hearthians (the player's race) are named after varieties of rocks and minerals.
[4:40:01] <%BioApple> so why weren't the proto-fish people scoured?
[4:40:03] <mrvidicus> If that space rock had the explosive energy to wipe out the solar system, couldn't it it make a substitute sun if harnessed then?
[4:40:06] <Tisaric> your race also was a water dwelling race at the time too
[4:40:07] <Mr_Rakjo> Attlerock tanked a hit?
[4:40:16] <+yeeyeyee> @BioApple underwater
[4:40:17] <Dugy123> This game man, new curve balls even after playing and watching for hours
[4:40:19] <DemonicHoward> attlerock is the best tank
[4:40:22] <Deekman> The moon protected the hearth
[4:40:27] <+Sestren413> attlerock tanked a dark branble hit, not a ghost matter hit
[4:40:28] <+QwertyThePie> @mrvidicus It was just full of ghost matter
[4:40:29] <JumbleJams> @BioApple probably cause they were in the soup
[4:40:31] <+Grayhammatter> wpw, the attlerock is littered with ice
[4:40:32] <$ZE_Count> What a good moon
[4:40:34] <+yeeyeyee> the hearthians only got out of the water after the ghost matter dissipated
[4:40:34] <%Aerkk> Moon used its cooldowns
[4:40:40] <%RubberFistFight> And all the Nomai are named after flowers (iirc)
[4:40:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> Attlerock greatest tank of all time. Took all the DPS
[4:40:42] <mrvidicus> @QwertyThePie Shit... Make a sun out of... ghosts, I dunno...
[4:40:46] <%Kirby_Sauce> @mrvidicus not death by explosion, more like death by poison saturation
[4:40:49] <+QwertyThePie> Sun's haunted
[4:40:49] <+Sestren413> that's dark bramble ice, not ghost matter
[4:40:52] <Aephol> moon protected little bro timberhearth
[4:41:04] <MasterDecoder> So, I haven't been paying too much attention till now, pretty much the Universe is dying, the Seeds are killing Planets, and that Comet cause Ghost poo?
[4:41:06] <SpellCatty> Are all the Nomai named after plants?
[4:41:07] <Zombrocom> Yeah
[4:41:10] <SpellCatty> Oh cool
[4:41:14] <Mr_Rakjo> Still
[4:41:14] <%RubberFistFight> @SpellCatty yep
[4:41:18] <Mr_Rakjo> Atllerock best tank
[4:41:21] <Mr_Rakjo> gets alla the aggro
[4:41:23] <%Reveresao> opp may bad, then how did we live??
[4:41:29] <$ZE_Count> ancestors just survived because they were underwater.
[4:41:29] <%Starlight_Gamer> what is pat getting at?
[4:41:30] <Zombrocom> Ok, so how many world destroying horrors are we up to now?
[4:41:31] <Deekman> It would be because of the core of the planet protected them because they used to be fish back then
[4:41:34] <%StripesUltimateEdition> attlerock used superbolide
[4:41:35] <%Reveresao> cuz we were underwater??
[4:41:36] <Aephol> ghost matter doesnt work underwater
[4:41:39] <Tisaric> @AngriestPat the hearthians didn't evolve out of the water until the ghost matter was manageable,
[4:41:40] <%Aerkk> Ghost Matter evaporated after thousands of years
[4:41:41] <LodiFrostbeard> it was so long ago that most of the ghost matter dissipated, but it killed everything in the solar system
[4:41:41] <Mr_Rakjo> Not evolved underwater species?
[4:41:43] <%galaxyswirl> there should be more on attle
[4:41:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Exactly like our moon it taunts everyone and gets all the agro
[4:41:45] <ashuckel> sun station
[4:41:47] <+Scevda> @Zombrocom Enough to kill anything that moves
[4:41:48] <Dugy123> Is the interloper a piece of that planet?
[4:41:51] <+QwertyThePie> Ash twin project, high energy lab, and black hole forge
[4:41:52] <$ZE_Count> lab is cool
[4:41:52] <garbageheaphound> black hole forge
[4:41:52] <%MagickBurritoh> Ash twin
[4:41:54] <+Shaggnar> katieT Big think
[4:41:54] <IronGlorfindel> man, this star system's got like 3 whole apocalypses goin on
[4:41:55] <%RubberFistFight> @SpellCatty and the Hearthians are named after minerals. Feldspar, Chert, etc
[4:41:55] <+QwertyThePie> And sun station
[4:41:56] <%SirGO0SE> ghosts, much like rats, can not swim
[4:41:59] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Brain Blast this bitch
[4:42:01] <PKLoveLucas> Yeah, the only creatures that seem to have survived are aquatic
[4:42:02] <zedravan> sun station?
[4:42:06] <mrvidicus> I wonder what developing this game did to the mental health of those involved.
[4:42:06] <Dugy123> Would explain all the ice
[4:42:06] <+Grayhammatter> so, sunless city time?
[4:42:12] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat all roads lead to rome.
[4:42:13] <Tisaric> pogonaThink
[4:42:17] <+linSP> ass twin is endgame
[4:42:20] <+MellowMute> Just a coincidence Kappa
[4:42:21] <JumbleJams> LUL
[4:42:23] <pullman15> sun station
[4:42:24] <%dekkitout> What does it mean!? NotLikeThis
[4:42:25] <kane21601> so then are the jellyfish originally from dark bramble? we found one on the bramble and in ice on giants deep, so are they actually alien to that planet?
[4:42:26] <+kinmarik> whistling?
[4:42:27] <caliento> city
[4:42:29] <$ZE_Count> coolio
[4:42:31] <HeadsHeldHigh> aaaaa
[4:42:32] <$SweetCheeksTrap> different colors are for different planets
[4:42:34] <%ShichiNoBushi> Whitling. You apparently crashed near the guys camp.
[4:42:35] <+Grayhammatter> pretty
[4:42:36] <Moonlight_Grimoire> I'm guessing he went to the core of Giant's Deep tonight
[4:42:40] <DemonicHoward> cool stream today pat
[4:42:41] <+Scevda> Punch the sun
[4:42:47] <Deekman> This was great
[4:42:47] <+LastHazzerd> jump into the sun
[4:42:48] <mrvidicus> Researching all the science involved in making this game is some real anxiety inducing shit. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the developers needed some form of coping with all that information.
[4:42:50] <HeadsHeldHigh> BIG knawledge
[4:42:51] <KaliasTV> Sun Station moves so fast
[4:42:52] <garbageheaphound> MAN FUCK THAT COMET
[4:42:55] <+yeeyeyee> the interloper is the biggest villain of this story by far
[4:42:55] <%galaxyswirl> isnt there a tp on attlerock?
[4:42:56] <$ZE_Count> comets are evil it is know
[4:42:56] <Deekman> Finish this up tomorrow
[4:42:58] <%RubberFistFight> @kane21601 they're apparently from whatever was there before it got taken over by Dark Bramble.
[4:43:00] <%SirGO0SE> tell us stories while looking at the stars pat
[4:43:02] <$SweetCheeksTrap> the comet isn't sapient Pat.
[4:43:04] <%Agami23> weird thing to call a floatin' space rock
[4:43:04] <%king_wragles> It totally hits the sun
[4:43:07] <%bakiinthedemon> Pat you've probably got one more good stream of this game left
[4:43:16] <DemonicHoward> you ever think about how crazy it is, that we are alive on this planet at all
[4:43:17] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I'm just a comet
[4:43:20] <%Aerkk> Good Strem Pat
[4:43:21] <%arkv01> jackass the planet
[4:43:22] <%SolverCODO> it hits the sun right before the sun explodes
[4:43:22] <+Grayhammatter> a celestial object is the antagonist? i can believe it
[4:43:24] <gamewarden92> Yes
[4:43:24] <%TheLakinessMonster> Fun was had
[4:43:24] <Thepenguinking1> is that what causes the supernova, ghost matter?
[4:43:25] <%Mornaka> yep
[4:43:25] <$ZE_Count> yeah!
[4:43:26] <%Gray_skies1993> awesome stream
[4:43:26] <%Tennochief> no
[4:43:26] <MasterDecoder> @GarbageQueenEllie eyyy
[4:43:26] <+LastHazzerd> i had fun pat dad
[4:43:27] <Ion_Laser> @Moonlight_Grimoire yeah it was the first thing he did on tonight's stream
[4:43:27] <%waltzqueen> waltzqueen is continuing the Gift Sub they got from MaximumDaximum!
[4:43:28] <%RubberFistFight> @mrvidicus some people find it freeing to confront the inevitability of the universe.
[4:43:28] <%ItsRatman> Hell yeah
[4:43:29] <%starotter70> Ye
[4:43:29] <%Tennochief> yes
[4:43:29] <%wsintai> yes mom
[4:43:29] <Aephol> Yeyeye
[4:43:29] <garbageheaphound> I had a lot of fun
[4:43:30] <%terminallyCapriciousz> I hated it
[4:43:30] <%Artimadare> Great stream
[4:43:30] <%Maids4lyfe> You think when the sun explodes it releases the ghost matter in the comet and destroys the universe?
[4:43:31] <+meatxsteam> Shut up dad
[4:43:31] <%salty_syd913> YE
[4:43:32] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> the heat death of all matter sure is fun
[4:43:32] <glaciusinfinite> Yeah
[4:43:33] <Nina96> perhaps
[4:43:33] <+mattymcfilth> why are there things exploding on the green planet?

[4:45:12] <gamewarden92> You had a big brain day.
[4:45:13] <%Aerkk> Exposed all the time
[4:45:16] <+Scevda> as you scratch them
[4:45:18] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> staring is tiring
[4:45:25] <%SirGO0SE> we know what that hand is doing
[4:45:30] <Nina96> cant see something that small pat
[4:45:40] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yeah it is, lol. I wasn't expecting streaming to be as exhausting as it is when i started doing it. Worth it for the most part though.
[4:45:40] <%RupanSen> but do the balls exist if we aren't looking at them?
[4:45:58] <+Grayhammatter> schrodingers balls
[4:46:01] <%SirGO0SE> @Nina96 FBCatch
[4:46:03] <GalaxyCrusher> HSWP GayPride
[4:46:10] <%Aerkk> Its like group improv theatre
[4:46:14] <%Artimadare> Still takes up emotional energy
[4:46:19] <%arancet> well you still gotta be 'on'
[4:46:20] <%SirGO0SE> entertainment
[4:46:21] <mrvidicus> Performance doesn't imply fakery! Concerts are performances!
[4:46:23] <%galaxyswirl> its pageantry
[4:46:24] <%ShichiNoBushi> Candidness?
[4:46:25] <Sacksquatch> Stage craft
[4:46:25] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat it's definitely a form of performance art. I have a friend thats into stage improv and he immediately identified that.
[4:46:28] <%starotter70> Yeah, now dance
[4:46:29] <%Aerkk> Pat is our dancing clown and we throw pennies on the stage for him
[4:46:34] <+Scevda> Nah, its performance, we all perform in order to be engaging and interact. The basis to our communication
[4:46:36] <%bakiinthedemon> Theres a level of energy that needs to be maintained for entertainment
[4:46:43] <%Mornaka> how do you not have a big EYE emote?
[4:46:46] <%Aerkk> O
[4:46:49] <IshikawaKenji> like sports entertainment
[4:46:49] <@lewdskeletor13> You’re trying to being entertaining which can be draining
[4:46:51] <+Grayhammatter> that anglerfish scream though
[4:46:59] <+kinmarik> like voyeur?
[4:47:03] <%SirGO0SE> when youd normally go oh ima take a 20 minute shit and a wank you instead spend that energy making us chucklefucks giggle
[4:47:09] <+Scevda> Ya, been there
[4:47:10] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> gonna stay up to play 3 houses
[4:47:11] <IminyourBase> you relax me like masturbation without all the work
[4:47:15] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> aren't you
[4:47:15] <gamewarden92> we are all psychic vampires
[4:47:17] <%Aerkk> I'm pretty sure EVO hype-guys just pass out after doing 6 hour tournaments it burns you out
[4:47:17] <%SolverCODO> because we're all energy vampires
[4:47:19] <asurite_warrior> because it's over
[4:47:20] <%RupanSen> and not sleep until 5
[4:47:22] <%starotter70> Fair
[4:47:23] <%SirGO0SE> the "im working" weight goes away
[4:47:24] <+kinmarik> works done
[4:47:27] <Psyramics> the freedom of responsibility over!
[4:47:27] <+Grayhammatter> PogChamp

[4:47:47] <asurite_warrior> you can touch your balls when the cameras are off
[4:47:48] <TheHeroAppears> someone had to

[4:47:49] <%wsintai> Bloodvertise that Turok Shadowbabyy!
[4:47:52] <%starotter70> He Better
[4:47:53] <%RubberFistFight> @lewdskeletor13 not only that, but you have to constantly keep a process running in your brain to make sure you stay on the right side of the rules. Meandering commentary can quickly get dangerous if you don't stay on top of it, and that takes a ludicrously large amount of mental energy.
[4:47:55] <%arkv01> no one has to know about the turok
[4:48:16] <mrvidicus> Awww man, WoW Classic is coming out in 20 days yo.

[4:50:21] <%arkv01> he was jacking it to the healing
[4:50:23] <%Puhff> Outer Wilds turned me into a violent white supremacist
[4:50:29] <%arkv01> thats what you get for being a WHM degenerate
[4:50:30] <%RubberFistFight> carabletunel?
[4:50:31] <+Grayhammatter> copper tunnel
[4:50:31] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> carpool tunel

[4:50:40] <HeadsHeldHigh> Cah cawpel tunnal
[4:50:43] <MasterDecoder> Copper Tunnel XD
[4:50:43] <%Tennochief> ironic
[4:50:44] <mrvidicus> Buy a powerball. That fixed the carple tunnel I was developing before it got out of hand.

[4:51:03] <Nina96> whats carpool tunnel pat? @AngriestPat
[4:51:10] <shinichizio> Just play with controller 4Head
[4:51:15] <%Tennochief> wrist deterioration
[4:51:21] <%SirGO0SE> adjust the height of your chair so that your wrist is drooping when holding your mouse, never arching up at the wrist
[4:51:23] <+Grayhammatter> the old game is jank af
[4:51:31] <%Aerkk> Does the new Vampire game have John DiMaggio
[4:51:34] <DracaenaLeaf> Yes
[4:51:38] <%RupanSen> big selling point will be quest design and writing
[4:51:39] <CopperTucker> yeah, I need to fix my keys really badly
[4:51:42] <CopperTucker> because this was _bad_
[4:51:43] <%Aerkk> Then it will be fine
[4:51:46] <%starotter70> We need to see what it's like to talk to people
[4:51:48] <+OkamiDude15> @AngriestPat you see the momodora people are doing a new game? it looks pretty rad
[4:51:49] <+SoulFrair> Hey Pat, what are the odds of Capcom bringing back DarkWatch?
[4:51:51] <Nina96> link?
[4:51:52] <DracaenaLeaf> During e3 I think
[4:51:54] <JDebss> It'd better still use the white wolf system
[4:51:56] <+ShadowForceX75> pat how's your bet with Paige on the smash dlc going? I think you're gonna win
[4:51:57] <$ZE_Count> sweet dreams pat
[4:51:57] <%arkv01> probably a millenial ass writing style
[4:51:59] <%waltzqueen> link?
[4:52:01] <@lewdskeletor13> There was some Outer Worlds gameplay the other day
[4:52:04] <%Aerkk> Good Sleep Pat
[4:52:08] <DracaenaLeaf> They showed off a quest
[4:52:10] <%Aerkk> Plz pet the baby for all of us
[4:52:17] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Minecraft Steve
[4:52:18] <%RubberFistFight> @CopperTucker if you're using a mouse, consider switching to a trackball like the logitech MX ERGO. It tilts sideways which stops your forearm bones from pronating - way more comfortable and better for you.
[4:52:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pride500 Yeah, I think you might like La Mulana Remake. A glitchless speedrun is like 2 hours, but a first playthrough is 35-80 depending on if you go for 100% and how good you are at taking notes and connecting dots. You're mostly backtracking, reading shit and going "What does that mean? Do what? Where? Oh, maybe it means THOSE statues."
[4:52:20] <%Puhff> Yeah Giant Bomb showed off Outer Worlds gameplay
[4:52:21] <%Schrodingers_Box> Did stream forget about the E3 Doxxing?
