[0:34:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> He looks so happy.
[0:34:57] <%Tennochief> they have slave chains
[0:34:59] <Malziel> Does the character run look a little wonky to anyone else?
[0:35:00] <Scyllas> @angriestpat Chaos Legion 2 looks great.
[0:35:01] <+CourageTheCat> he looks like he's having an awful time
[0:35:02] <Renuarb> @AngriestPat Is it bad that this game is kinda giving me Xenoblade X vibes?
[0:35:03] <+Ran196> Slavery is cool!
[0:35:04] <%Piemen99> WHAT?!!!
[0:35:05] <tigerfang86> a WHOLE LOT
[0:35:06] <derekwst3> all pokemon hate it
[0:35:06] <transporterthesequel> wait your Baton has gotten way more anime
[0:35:07] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Are we the baddies?

[0:35:12] <%Kirby_Sauce> So cheap trick
[0:35:13] <nah_stradamus> hes tsundere
[0:35:15] <%arcaderabbit48> This is most definitely not his fetish
[0:35:15] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @arcaderabbit48 He stayed behind in the Hueco Mundo to hold off the berserk stnads
[0:35:19] <%kyh9> Well Chimaera don't go to complain about INVADING FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION
[0:35:20] <%dekkitout> He also has summon swords
[0:35:20] <ScreamLord> The Legatus is just a Dual Disk
[0:35:23] <crowfox> Jump Pog
[0:35:27] <ravencloak13> The number 20th preset color for Sword Legion is just EVA 1 colors
[0:35:33] <Hydrapissed> super sayian god super sayian
[0:35:33] <tigerfang86> You became CASPAR Pat
[0:35:35] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> SSJGSSJ
[0:35:35] <%arcaderabbit48> @Sphincter_Spelunker Got it, thanks
[0:35:36] <+Nymphonomicon> Why does your Stand that doesn't want to be enslaved by a policeman have "POLICE" written on his arm blades?
[0:35:36] <+ennui_on_me> that's just the Nocturne protag
[0:35:36] <tigerfang86> you're CASPAR NOW
[0:35:38] <nah_stradamus> thats straight up just nocturne
[0:35:38] <+JacktheMan18> @AngriestPat You can customize your stand's colors btw
[0:35:38] <+NitronStreams> 「ＣＲＡＺＹ ＴＡＬＫ」
[0:35:39] <ShichiNoBushi> Wrap your own legs like an AT-AT.
[0:35:40] <+squirtkitten> >not playing as the cute police waifu
[0:35:42] <+Ran196> Future Slavery for the Future
[0:35:42] <%Tennochief> @Kirby_Sauce less cheap trick and more Purple Haze
[0:35:43] <%TimetodiveLTX> that sure is smt nocturne
[0:35:44] <vexion_smh> devil trigger mode
[0:35:46] <%linSP> how many stands are in this
[0:35:46] <crowfox> I heard this game is basically the plot of Custom Robo
[0:35:47] <Tucker0603> damn I need a switch and this game
[0:35:48] <Bloodhit> Nocturne boy?
[0:35:52] <Xxx_wiiuboss_xxx> 5
[0:35:54] <+DZiffer> I bet he loved having "Police" drawn on his cool swords
[0:35:55] <$valriot> You look like a Need For Speed NPC
[0:35:56] <Setaro> Hitoshura <3
[0:36:02] <%salty_syd913> PogChamp when

[0:36:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> Persona Genesis Evanjojo: Stand Alone Complex
[0:36:12] <tigerfang86> m e d
[0:36:15] <MikeNized> Anything happening in the game is now nullified due to Crazy Talk.
[0:36:16] <+Rinkimah> You touched him and ruined it rooD
[0:36:16] <%salty_syd913> i want to customise
[0:36:19] <%Kirby_Sauce> That handcuff thing reminds me of a duel disk
[0:36:21] <+ckangaroo15k> Holy shit this game is awesome looking, sucks it had to come out right as I start the hardest semester of my life :(
[0:36:21] <$renegadehatter> Every Vending Machine has a different personality
[0:36:21] <Xxx_wiiuboss_xxx> VERGIL
[0:36:21] <ShichiNoBushi> Astral Chain Elmo?
[0:36:25] <+DZiffer> He's mad because you are playing with other Stands
[0:36:27] <%arcaderabbit48> The Swords aren't actually his, those are part of the armor containing him
[0:36:29] <Mendin> Emlo the Legion/Nemesis
[0:36:32] <EynosStyles> @rumtumtugnutz Damn Skippy
[0:36:34] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Kirby_Sauce They literally do a duel disk pose
[0:36:43] <Xxx_wiiuboss_xxx> I NEED MORE POWER

[0:36:54] <nah_stradamus> when do you get a dark magician stand
[0:36:54] <$valriot> Looks like a fuckin Dreamcast
[0:36:56] <+threamstream> @angriestpat what is the difference between the various legions?
[0:36:59] <liflamor> I hav3 the distinct feeeling that the home base is going to get wrecked in the future.
[0:37:02] <derekwst3> this is big anime by the way
[0:37:03] <%cureneckbeard> duel audio
[0:37:03] <%Wallabri> Ahh your stand, who hates you
[0:37:08] <+DZiffer> It's time to D-D-D-D-Duel!
[0:37:08] <Thalchampz> LUL
[0:37:10] <MikeNized> Kaiba. My stand is in attack mode and I'm gonna slash you down.
[0:37:11] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Oh yeah, you and your twin sister knew how to henshin when you got your stands for the first time
[0:37:13] <%blinkinthedark> can we get a platinum Yu-Gi-Oh game
[0:37:17] <tigerfang86> ZA HAND
[0:37:19] <thattallguy47> Za HANDO
[0:37:20] <Balsty> sick
[0:37:21] <$renegadehatter> Once you get farther in the game with these upgrades you will regret your WORDS and ACTIONS
[0:37:21] <%Tennochief> [THE HND]
[0:37:26] <%arcaderabbit48> I can't think of a single anime visual trope they have not used yet
[0:37:27] <gemini_night> Cyberpunk 2077 in less 30 min
[0:37:28] <%ElenaManetta> uuhh pat just got cursed?
[0:37:29] <CherrieVelvet> actual elevators TakeNRG
[0:37:33] <Cypherblack> richaaard
[0:37:36] <MikeNized> Yu-Gi-Oh Warriors.
[0:37:38] <Pakooboomi> we're gonna get all of the stands arent we
[0:37:38] <DaBigVitus> pretty sure the dog has blade wolf moves
[0:37:45] <Bloodhit> Does this plays like V from DMC5? cirISee
[0:37:47] <Lilgamba> Unga
[0:37:55] <Cypherblack> ur eyes look like you're from dune when they glow like that
[0:37:57] <transporterthesequel> He's just the big rival now!
[0:37:59] <Balsty> @AngriestPat would it be worth it to have a page on anime tropes open while playing this game?
[0:38:01] <tigerfang86> rooIsee
[0:38:01] <%PanicSwytch> Faaather
[0:38:02] <+DZiffer> I hope one of the NPCs at some point says "I know we can make it, all we gotta do is believe in the heart of the cards!"
[0:38:03] <%blinkinthedark> Persona x Yu-Gi-Oh
[0:38:06] <%TimetodiveLTX> do combo
[0:38:07] <reasonance> this BGM is fresh
[0:38:08] <$valriot> Watch him become DAD STAND
[0:38:10] <SpaceGuntank> shit i got in late, did i miss anything cool or anime?
[0:38:12] <Tucker0603> that Iris system reminds me of Armored core V scan mode
[0:38:24] <tigerfang86> SUPER NOT EVIL
[0:38:27] <%thunderborn32> @AngriestPat there is no way your spacial anime boy is 100% human
[0:38:28] <%arcaderabbit48> @Bloodhit No, the Legion is semi-autonomous in what it attacks. You can direct where and what it attacks, but it mostly fights on its own and you work with that
[0:38:32] <MikeNized> Honestly, I was considering getting either this game or Bayonetta.
[0:38:33] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Gendo was my hero
[0:38:35] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> He reminds me so much of Aramaki
[0:38:36] <derekwst3> oh and dad was lost in shadow realm
[0:38:37] <%Tennochief> look at this greasy ass man
[0:38:42] <%1matheuw> oh look its the secret bad guy
[0:38:45] <nawadap136> oh MAN is this dude evil
[0:38:47] <DaBigVitus> my bet is one eyed dude from the start is the final boss
[0:38:48] <%GarbageNirvana> Alright Not-Gendo
[0:38:48] <transporterthesequel> I predict two rival fights and the third he heroically sacrifices himself to save you
[0:38:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Why would you think he's evil? Because this is an anime and the Commander is always evil?
[0:38:49] <%thunderborn32> is that a megaman boss screen?!?
[0:38:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> This dude is totes gonna go Cobra Commander on us, right?
[0:38:52] <Ion_Laser> @SpaceGuntank nope. Pat's is chatting with everyone at the police station
[0:38:52] <%arcaderabbit48> His face looks liks its a mask
[0:38:56] <+wwwwwww1> no way why would you be the bad guys
[0:38:56] <Frostydough1> @angriestpat how long will you be playing for? I have class rn so I’ll have to catch the stream in about an hour :(
[0:39:02] <+CaptainGrime> yo that one on the far right looks dope
[0:39:03] <%reonome> that guy looks really evil
[0:39:06] <+wwwwwww1> that could never happen
[0:39:16] <Reanimator83> That old dudes hair is on point
[0:39:16] <%thunderborn32> but baba
[0:39:24] <%Tennochief> So there are only 5 legions? No more?
[0:39:28] <+DZiffer> I really hoped you wouldn't make it-... I mean, good to see you! I'm not evil!
[0:39:31] <%1matheuw> this dude is 100% merging with an evil god or something
[0:39:35] <derekwst3> Far right is punch man
[0:39:35] <%reonome> ME?
[0:39:40] <+Qsmash_> me? :)
[0:39:40] <Tucker0603> DUDE THE AXE LEGION IS A PALADIN TYPE
[0:39:42] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Until we restart the slave trade....I mean restart Legion production.
[0:39:47] <%dekkitout> Cam we get kickass bird-Legion
[0:39:47] <%arcaderabbit48> "Congrats nerd, you're the new main character."
[0:39:48] <transporterthesequel> YOUR THE MOST IMPORTANT!!!!
[0:39:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> They've only captured 5 of them. So yeah, there's only five legions
[0:39:50] <+valkuma> This one random new guy is the center of the entire military?
[0:39:51] <%ElenaManetta> I'm only a BIT familiar with anime cliches and tropes, is Yoseph sizing himself up to be the TWIST VILLAIN?
[0:39:52] <dakehtc> Me?
[0:39:55] <%blinkinthedark> yes anime protag please save us
[0:39:56] <%ElenaManetta> he's coming across like it

[0:40:13] <$rytyoung> and how did he see that shit that went down?
[0:40:13] <+DZiffer> I assure you I'm only half evil!

[0:40:18] <%thunderborn32> @AngriestPat HOW? did he put camera in another dimension?
[0:40:18] <nah_stradamus> its like youre a protagonist or something
[0:40:19] <nawadap136> oh hey Gendo
[0:40:22] <+CourageTheCat> yeah he looks like he's in harmony lmao
[0:40:22] <%linSP> meeeee
[0:40:23] <%Kirby_Sauce> My cousin roped me into a game of the cyanide and happines version of cards against humanity. When he wasn't looking i put the 5 pieces of exodia on the table as an answer. Yes, i carry around spare exodia pieces at all times.

[0:40:33] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Tennochief oh, and some enemies look like Warframes
[0:40:35] <%arcaderabbit48> I want the twist to be that he isnt evil at all. He's just really creepy, but ultimately morally upstanding
[0:40:36] <%Tennochief> @Sphincter_Spelunker thanks man
[0:40:36] <%abakkus> this dude hardcore sounds like a big villain

[0:41:08] <UncleOliver> but does the game have the FATEVIL?
[0:41:10] <+DZiffer> "This world is imperfect... If only everything could be as in harmony as me!"
[0:41:11] <%blinkinthedark> Yes *HERO* your dick is so B I G

[0:41:39] <%DexteraXIII> "In case someone like you came along." Like I was planning the whole time.
[0:41:39] <+CaptainGrime> @ChamoCamouflage some people are very mis cast but some like yoseh there are alright jap is better imo
[0:41:43] <phatballlz54> i can't tell if this guy is gonna end up being evil or not
[0:41:44] <+skip_dippety> It would be super great if Yoseph was just a huge, friendly weirdo like Doktor from MGR.

[1:17:16] <%Tennochief> we can customize the colors even more later
[1:17:18] <haisho> use your summon swords
[1:17:22] <+Inriri> Thanks. Trying to decide if I should use a game voucher on it
[1:17:22] <$valriot> He says Legion like Garrus in Legion And Friends
[1:17:24] <%ElenaManetta> This outfit is also rad, I hope Pat doesn't change it for something dumb like a poofy hat
[1:17:31] <%MegboyManuel> summon swords pls dad
[1:17:36] <%gasgrave> only use the baton, like the instructions say
[1:17:45] <ravencloak13> @elenamanetta You unlock a poof hat as part of Lappy’s costume set.
[1:17:46] <Mobilebeardunit> Hey siri, define "Overt"

[1:18:32] <%Tennochief> @MegboyManuel night
[1:18:36] <masterjayshay> Pat playing Plat. I love it.
[1:18:45] <+theman515> standu power
[1:18:46] <Mendin> There has to be a charge shot or something
[1:18:52] <%arcaderabbit48> Unsurprisingly, Gun seems not great
[1:18:58] <Mendin> That seems worse than Scarborough Faire
[1:19:04] <%argavus> argavus subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:19:05] <+Inriri> I am a little surprised one of the animations doesn't involve him using his foot to shoot
[1:19:08] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> where's the gun stinger
[1:19:13] <tigerfang86> Do a RAINSTORM
[1:19:15] <ravencloak13> @arcaderabbit48 Gun is literally combo extender/juggle.
[1:19:21] <ShichiNoBushi> No! The drones have turned against us!
[1:19:26] <chippa250> I eat ass
[1:19:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> gun combos are pretty flashy
[1:19:43] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> thanks for sharing
[1:19:55] <+MageShady> Need a helter skelter
[1:19:57] <%argavus> suppose its about time to suport the gremlin
[1:19:57] <Onmi_Khaos> When did pat start playtesting the new megaman zero game?
[1:19:58] <%Estuko> split screen or main char controlling camera would've been a better coop decision
[1:20:08] <masterjayshay> I'm supposed to get this game in a few hours and I'm so excited.
[1:20:12] <SulfurousAcid> D
[1:20:16] <Soul_Intern> Andof course, perfect dodges are a thing
[1:20:16] <ravencloak13> Also shot gun ender combo does some good damage cause of all the shots it gives off.
[1:20:24] <$Yakobro> D
[1:20:24] <tigerfang86> DISMAL
[1:20:24] <%1matheuw> Dismal
[1:20:25] <%Tennochief> DISMAL
[1:20:25] <LixFury> LUL
[1:20:26] <$valriot> LUL
[1:20:27] <+Jonesman64> rank D for.. big dick
[1:20:28] <%Laecerelius> Awww jeeze
[1:20:28] <%arcaderabbit48> @ravencloak13 That's fair, and to be expected. I've just always really wished guns could be their own fully fleshed out fighting style in these sorts of games, rather than just "the thing you do inbetween other things."
[1:20:32] <masterjayshay> DULL
[1:20:36] <nawadap136> Don't Worry
[1:20:42] <+AngriestAngryArtist> how the fuck was that a D?!
[1:20:46] <zv1neda> DEAD WEIGHT
[1:20:49] <Valdorick> Gladius - "Slow and large".... I... I don't think... That's right.
[1:20:50] <Mobilebeardunit> BIG
[1:20:51] <tigerfang86> STAGGER
[1:20:52] <LixFury> D = Do it again shitlord LUL
[1:20:56] <Mendin> Wasnt this Angelo the first miniboss of the game?
[1:20:58] <tigerfang86> DESTROY THE POISE
[1:20:59] <ChamoCamouflage> Try the Charge thing?
[1:21:01] <%BubbaRands> These animations thooooooo PogChamp
[1:21:01] <zeif00> this OST fuckin slaps
[1:21:05] <%argavus> Destestable
[1:21:07] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AngriestAngryArtist He took way too much damage and too much time.
[1:21:10] <Mister_McDerp> SourPls
[1:21:13] <Soul_Intern> OH SHIT
[1:21:13] <masterjayshay> Moves where you spin kick using your sword as a pole gets me excited like you wouldn't believe.
[1:21:15] <Soul_Intern> BIG GUY
[1:21:17] <%Tennochief> GORILLA
[1:21:24] <Mobilebeardunit> THEY BIGGER
[1:21:33] <ravencloak13> @arcaderabbit48 Fair but thing is... why would anyone use melee weapons then if guns were objectively better?
[1:21:42] <ravencloak13> Cause range.
[1:21:43] <noobpsyboticus> remember the counter slash mechanic!!
[1:21:44] <alrobot2014> can you parry it?
[1:21:45] <ShichiNoBushi> I hope this game has an Ukemi.
[1:21:47] <Mendin> @masterjayshay Welcome to Platinum Games then friendo
[1:21:48] <%TimetodiveLTX> gotta do the at-at thing
[1:21:50] <masterjayshay> Pat getting clapped by the first member of the DK crew.
[1:21:55] <Onmi_Khaos> It does Shichi
[1:21:57] <%Estuko> delayed swings/hits are my worst enemy
[1:21:58] <derekwst3> thats what she says
[1:22:03] <%DexteraXIII> DS2Stream.gif
[1:22:05] <%thunderborn32> why would the suggest using it again the enemy type its the worst against? large weapon should be against hordes and gun should be used against big slow guy
[1:22:10] <%Shadicara> F
[1:22:10] <Punisher7771> sup pat can you stop being bad?
[1:22:18] <Mister_McDerp> just git gud
[1:22:30] <masterjayshay> @mendin Oh yeah I know Platinum games. They're one of my favorite devs.
[1:22:34] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Don't Worry
[1:22:35] <%devanmuse> You know what your problem is? He's hitting you. You can't let him do that.
[1:22:38] <%argavus> DOOOODGE
[1:22:41] <ravencloak13> @thunderborn32 What no, since when? Big sword for big guy and shooting for fast moving targets.
[1:22:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> What does this game have in terms of progression and grinding?
[1:22:43] <zv1neda> DISMAL
[1:22:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I think you have to dodge towards this guy's attacks, because they leave an open spot behind him.
[1:22:45] <%arcaderabbit48> @ravencloak13 You could make them more fleshed out but still keep their power on the lower end of things.
[1:22:50] <Onmi_Khaos> Patton we JUSt started
[1:22:57] <masterjayshay> Pat, you gotta go TRICKSTER.
[1:22:58] <DaBigVitus> I look away for a minute and he already has EVA colors
[1:23:00] <ravencloak13> You can also use your Legion as back dash.
[1:23:02] <oAznoUta> are the attack patterns always in time with the music, or was that just coincidence?
[1:23:06] <+MageShady> These are DK moves
[1:23:08] <%Tennochief> I wonder what they're all thinking while watching this
[1:23:12] <SulfurousAcid> use your skills
[1:23:14] <Tha_Mik> just kill him
[1:23:16] <noobpsyboticus> counter slash you fucking boomer
[1:23:20] <zv1neda> over heads PogChamp
[1:23:20] <ravencloak13> @dabigvitus It’s literally the first color unlocked for Sword Legion.
[1:23:20] <ZE_Count> Hows the game pat?
[1:23:25] <%Tennochief> "Wow the captain's son sure is shit at this"\
[1:23:26] <SulfurousAcid> D
[1:23:27] <Soul_Intern> fuck

[1:23:31] <Mister_McDerp> Just don't get hit 4Head
[1:23:32] <nawadap136> "Excellent"
[1:23:32] <Valdorick> The ladies in the office are watching... They're turning drier than the Sahara.
[1:23:33] <ChamoCamouflage> Is there an E?
[1:23:39] <oAznoUta> sick bit of music right here I'll tell you what
[1:23:41] <ShepardUA> cyberpunk, Pat

[1:23:47] <SpaceGuntank> the best hope for humanity just got his ass handed to him in a training mission
[1:23:52] <Punisher7771> wait why dose the stand have police on it?
[1:23:54] <+squirtkitten> how can you know? you havent played the game yet LUL
[1:23:55] <DaBigVitus> @ravencloak13 LUL platinum are shameless fanboyds

[1:24:30] <ravencloak13> Also this cyberpunk as fuck to.
[1:24:35] <This_is_Marco> LUL true
[1:24:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> Platty for Patty
[1:24:43] <Tha_Mik> pat is saying cyberpunk sucks Kappa
[1:24:43] <+MageShady> Need trickster for these
[1:24:43] <%Tennochief> this is hardly like cyber punk
[1:24:44] <LixFury> aparently bug gameplay footage
[1:24:50] <$valriot> But you can be a male body with girl voice, big progressive, 100% not a cop out
[1:24:51] <DaBigVitus> would be cool if the chain could change color
[1:24:53] <Punisher7771> but cyberpunk pat
[1:25:00] <%DedlokPM> Who cares about Cyberpunk when we have PokéJoJo May Cry? SERIOUSLY, WHO? PEOPLE WITHOUT HEARTS! THAT IS WHO!
[1:25:21] <masterjayshay> I like how they say only three have passed instead of "No one has ever passed."
[1:25:21] <%Estuko> @valriot finally have the opportunity to create a Dr. Girlfriend in Cyberpunk from Venture Bros
[1:25:22] <%kyh9> USE YOUR X BATON
[1:25:32] <Tha_Mik> Use dt
[1:25:32] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> You totally could have dodged that
[1:25:34] <Punisher7771> so pat @DedlokPM ?
[1:25:36] <%Shadicara> Cheers by the way pat I'm getting this game next week now
[1:25:36] <%arcaderabbit48> You should probably counter more often
[1:25:38] <+MageShady> Send em
[1:25:39] <DevinMayCry> You get the ability to recover health from enemies similar to a Zandatsu in revengance
[1:25:39] <ravencloak13> @dabigvitus Chain... I think can’t but the UI color can.
[1:25:40] <$valriot> @estuko LUL
[1:25:41] <CybertronPrime> Is there a Witch Time analog in this? Cop Time?
[1:25:43] <ZE_Count> I like this and Cyberpunk because I need distraction while the earth dies.
[1:25:53] <ravencloak13> @cybertronprime Yep.
[1:26:00] <+Valentttine> My guy thank you so much for streaming in reasonable for EU hours cirLove
[1:26:01] <+MageShady> Oh? You can cut the arms off?
[1:26:08] <%dekkitout> I look forward to the enemy who's mainly parry vulnerable
[1:26:09] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Cyberpunk gameplay reveal was barely a reveal for any gameplay...
[1:26:19] <$valriot> Thicc Gorilla boi
[1:26:19] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @ZE_Count Earth is gonna be just fine. Humans on the other hand
[1:26:26] <ActingKing42> @AngriestPat your thoughts on this game?
[1:26:28] <Mobilebeardunit> Fighting VR versions of dimensional demons with your digi sword slaveghost doesnt disappoint.
[1:26:29] <%DedlokPM> @Punisher7771 No. He has a heart because he wants to play PokéJoJo instead of stopping so he can check on some random Cyperpunk updates
[1:26:29] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Man, a new appreciation for Maximillion who did this easy. I knew he was good, but fuck.
[1:26:30] <+Kduff89> I am so sad I dont have enough money for this game right now. cryShrug
[1:26:30] <%Estuko> @ZE_Count FeelsBadMan when the heat death of the universe isn't going to be what kills you

[1:27:31] <Fodderbot> a streamer is about to become the first level 60 in WoW classic
[1:27:39] <masterjayshay> So how exactly does this game work?
[1:27:42] <Picia000123> Cyberpunk stream was pretty hype :)
[1:27:47] <Soul_Intern> Remember Pat, red shine, activate zandatsu, slice the red line
[1:27:52] <Picia000123> This game looks fun too
[1:27:56] <ravencloak13> @burritocheetos This game has DMC level of combat complexity and ability trees... he’s going to be training for a bit.

[1:29:18] <%Tennochief> It was the first unlockable color
[1:29:22] <ravencloak13> @this_is_marco I honestly think how they want you to play with a second player would make it easier.

[1:31:42] <Mobilebeardunit> try counting like Paige?
[1:31:43] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Count their attacks to concentrate.
[1:31:43] <%argavus> you can do it patty
[1:31:46] <%dekkitout> Oh, it's a 'learn the move sets' instead of the Arkham style 'flash above head'
[1:31:46] <Onmi_Khaos> Great start Pat
[1:31:51] <Hillthugsta> fission mailed
[1:31:51] <masterjayshay> Is there character customization and how in depth is it?

[1:32:02] <ravencloak13> @masterjayshay Yes.
[1:32:06] <%Estuko> @masterjayshay yes and Monster Hunter levels
[1:32:10] <%TheDullaMAN> Don't forget you can bind things, Pat
[1:32:11] <masterjayshay> Nice.
[1:32:18] <SulfurousAcid> Pat, if you'e getting hit this much in round one you're in trouble
[1:32:20] <+MageShady> The enemies are aggressive as hell
[1:32:20] <mayorrev> @sphincter_spelunker on off hit drink
[1:32:25] <masterjayshay> Thanks for answering all my annoying questions guys. I'm just hyped.
[1:32:34] <%Tennochief> @Estuko you'll know once you see everything slow down
[1:32:43] <%Tennochief> Like that jsut now
[1:32:43] <ZE_Count> Wrap him up pat!
[1:32:44] <%Shadicara> There's enough combos to forget a lot of them I like that
[1:32:47] <rcand9> @ravencloak13 probably beat it on the lowest difficulty im guessing
[1:32:56] <OrpheusXP> Oh look, it's the game with a stand in it
[1:32:56] <%Tennochief> leg
[1:32:59] <%Estuko> Also Lads for anyone playing Remnants be wary that the most recent update has deleted a bunch of people's saves. Make sure to back up your saves and kill the cloud save option from properties.
[1:33:06] <%Estuko> <3 <3
[1:33:07] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat you need to drop your stand ever so often
[1:33:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> If only there were a meter you could look at that old you how long your stand could stay out.
[1:33:09] <ravencloak13> The mode that says “the game plays itself” yeah.
[1:33:09] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @mayorrev "One, two, thr-- FUCK! This is fine."
[1:33:11] <%Tennochief> oh that's fucky
[1:33:15] <SulfurousAcid> chain up big boy
[1:33:20] <%Shadicara> Remember you can sling shot them back too
[1:33:31] <%BubbaRands> He's learnin'
[1:33:36] <ravencloak13> Also check IRIS for health bar.
[1:33:46] <Mobilebeardunit> Is there a "ballsacks" emote I could be spamming?
[1:33:50] <%argavus> quick give him your energy
[1:33:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I like the hyper-early dodges that string together into the enemy's combo.
[1:33:52] <%TheDullaMAN> Is there not a jump?
[1:33:54] <SulfurousAcid> use skills
[1:34:00] <derekwst3> drop the stand like you would drop the shield
[1:34:21] <%Estuko> @Mobilebeardunit have this ω
[1:34:33] <%Estuko> Best I could do lol
[1:34:40] <Mobilebeardunit> @etsuko thankyou for scrote

[1:35:07] <ZE_Count> Why never chain him?
[1:35:08] <ElBuraindo> not so great game now
[1:35:08] <+HyperCharge_Sam> use your sword abilities too
[1:35:09] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @AngriestPat this is optional. take a breather
[1:35:10] <%Shadicara> You can also bind him with a chain pat
[1:35:13] <orangemdt> why did you just stop trying the dna cut?
[1:35:13] <+Jax1Draws> how am I gonna play a game like this with no jump button
[1:35:14] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Don't let your meter hit 0
[1:35:16] <derekwst3> training is boring
[1:35:16] <+Inriri> Why not use the gun or baton until you set up a stun and then switch to gladius?
[1:35:19] <ChamoCamouflage> Use your Legion Skills too
[1:35:19] <%Shadicara> You're forgetting more combos than you're learning LUL

[1:35:30] <%devanmuse> "Huh..." Did he really not consider jumping over the shockwave?
[1:35:33] <ravencloak13> @inriri The Gladius can stun by itself.
[1:35:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> It's just a stamina bar
[1:35:43] <ChicoMaroto> Pat DONT FORGET YOU CAN CHAIN LOCK
[1:35:48] <derekwst3> stand down
[1:35:50] <%ElenaManetta> I feel like you're going to get worse if you don't take a break from the monotony of trying to do one counter repeatedly
[1:35:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> sort of lol
[1:35:50] <noobpsyboticus> I was worried this game would be too easy Kappa
[1:35:53] <%Tennochief> you also have summon swords
[1:36:02] <+Kduff89> whats bothering me is there is such big wind ups on that big guy and pat keeps trying to hit during them. Learn from piccolo and dodge
[1:36:05] <Mendin> There's like four difficulty levels
[1:36:05] <KasiCrafter> Aww hecc, how much As Chain did I miss?

[1:42:42] <DevinMayCry> The big baton does defensive offensive with delay attack

[2:25:52] <dukenux> vvymyn magik
[2:25:56] <%Estuko> Hello There -Obi Wan
[2:25:59] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Ho was also "Women deserve better workplace treatment" but treated Paiges like shit.
[2:25:59] <SomersaultJustice> if you finish FF4, it will break your curse. I know. I am a curseologist
[2:26:01] <%arancet> she was a feminist... against equal pay?
[2:26:04] <+captain_elsewhere> im pretty sure paige was cursed at conception elaC
[2:26:09] <IminyourBase> that was the second time you were cursed by a witch
[2:26:09] <SilverFaustX> so is this game more like judgement and just a dash of bayonetta ?
[2:26:14] <Onmi_Khaos> She probably thought that Paige wasn't for equal Pay
[2:26:16] <%Laecerelius> They used their zappy gun to shoot it!
[2:26:16] <DocMadfox> Which hoes mad? The witch hoes.
[2:26:17] <pillowwasp> Feminism is meant to be equality
[2:26:23] <ravencloak13> @silverfaustx Both.
[2:26:24] <Onmi_Khaos> Or Paige said she didn't believe in the Wage Gap or something
[2:26:27] <dukenux> @Paige have you seen "Drag me to hell?"
[2:26:28] <Omega1180> i've been asleep since last stream what i miss?
[2:26:30] <Mendin> It was an Ass 2 Ass attack

[2:26:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @pillowwasp people will always corrupt a movement to their own ends
[2:26:48] <derekwst3> someone buy me panda express
[2:26:50] <Valdorick> Witch facts, Paige - using curses tends to have a feedback effect where the caster gets it 3 times worse. So she has like, super lupus or something now. Or her curse is living in Australia. @AngriestPat
[2:26:53] <+captain_elsewhere> 3rd wave elaKek
[2:27:08] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> A Robin Hood who missed the first shot.
[2:27:13] <%Laecerelius> Will we be fighting the enemy stand user in this level?
[2:27:23] <%Tennochief> Living in Australia is a curse
[2:27:25] <CurrySauseBandit> @ravencloak13 True. But looking at it now. I can't help but see, Person-shaped doggo, Gorilla-shaped doggo, ect. It's weird now.
[2:27:25] <%SnackinOnChimps> Or she is dating three patricks
[2:27:27] <+agent_numa_lol> australian lupus?!
[2:27:28] <+Nanashi_Sakamoto> elaKek
[2:27:30] <%Tennochief> fedback

[2:27:36] <%pectusumbra> I mean if you're bad, sure
[2:27:38] <+CaptainGrime> mmm i love fedback
[2:27:40] <tragicjohnson84> I'm a witch myself, I delete the curse
[2:27:40] <$jobbedbone> and they make gross jars with piss, blood, nails and broken glass
[2:27:42] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat Peach say no more curse and your curse will be broken

[2:55:33] <$renegadehatter> Loop Jump!
[2:55:34] <This_is_Marco> I feel like every platinum game is the most platinum game they've made. theyre always slightly adapting their style
[2:55:35] <SulfurousAcid> I'm tired from having staying up late to watch last night's stream
[2:55:37] <Tim579> Did you just pick up a bunch of crystals using your stand?!
[2:55:38] <ElBuraindo> touch it

[2:56:18] <+mcjimbo12> I desperately want to believe this is the prototype for platinum's licensed jojo title
[2:56:28] <mattrutland> &^

[2:56:44] <$vincerocmm> what a time to be alive
[2:57:01] <gustavozxd> would be cool if platinum and arcsys were making a JoJo game, but instead, they're making it for a free to play gatcha game FeelsBadMan
[2:57:07] <This_is_Marco> @AngriestPat does it feel weird the legion moves massively faster than you when dual controlling characters?

[3:03:10] <+machinetoys> that was a pressure button but it's floating how does that work

[3:03:33] <+zaworldo> Are there other legion forms?
[3:03:36] <Mobilebeardunit> can you walk on top of those columns?

[3:21:02] <%Tennochief> LUL
[3:21:03] <%Louie_Salmon> @doc_ock_rokc Okay but get ready for the scene right after this mission
[3:21:05] <Tucker0603> so did pat choose sword legion? or do you not star with a choice?

[3:22:06] <ThorW> Just Royal Guard his moves
[3:22:07] <%arcaderabbit48> We saw a dog Legion in the opening, so this might actually get us someone new
[3:22:09] <SulfurousAcid> use skills
[3:22:12] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> man, those full health items are gonna fuck up the score I bet
[3:22:12] <%Tennochief> maybe this is how we'll unlock dog stand

[3:29:50] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Wish us Floridians some luck lol
[3:29:52] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Those civvies did their job and took the hits for the officer so he could save the day.
[3:29:59] <FuqBoiSlim> I like how this game has everyone saying "civvies" like they're actual cops LUL
[3:30:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> civvies is fun to say
[3:30:16] <Sokumotanaka> @DaBigVitus luckily these aint real police

[3:30:28] <Psyramics> remember when he was a boss, 5 minutes ago? regular enemy now
[3:30:29] <%dekkitout> Round 2 MF
[3:30:35] <%InugamiTheHound> boss become regular enemy now
[3:30:36] <+Kitafin> round 2
[3:30:37] <SomersaultJustice> kaisar waiv
[3:30:39] <+Rolandknight> Game still good?
[3:30:41] <tanarath> The cop is supposed to beat the civies, not let them be beaten.
[3:30:44] <Mendin> This game's pace of Shit Escalating is a bit heavy
[3:30:46] <$renegadehatter> IRIS
[3:30:49] <gustavozxd> @psyramics he wasn't even a boss though
[3:30:53] <FuqBoiSlim> not even 5 minutes later the boss is a regular enemy
[3:30:59] <DracaenaLeaf> other way around but yeah
[3:31:01] <Psyramics> he was framed like a boss
[3:31:03] <Valdorick> A boss become a mook?
[3:31:06] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Whats the chances of your Legions turning on you but turning back to your side through Power of Friendship?
[3:31:08] <%Louie_Salmon> Next we'll have a boss that summons itself as an ad during it's own boss fight
[3:31:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> IRIS muh boi
[3:31:09] <SundarkSoldier> I mean he didn't have a life bar
[3:31:09] <gustavozxd> but he wasn't a boss
[3:31:14] <%spacehouse> Chain yourself to the robot Shinji
[3:31:16] <%reonome> he wasn't really a boss
[3:31:17] <alrobot2014> bayonetta did it in the same verse with a boss in mission 2
[3:31:18] <Kejang> YOU HAD ENOUGH TIME TO LEARN
[3:31:19] <%dekkitout> Level 1 boss, level 100 goon
[3:31:20] <SundarkSoldier> Cerberus was a boss, Diomedes didn't
[3:31:23] <SundarkSoldier> wasn't*
[3:31:24] <gustavozxd> he got introduced on his own, that's it
[3:31:26] <Tha_Mik> mini boss
[3:31:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> circle him?
[3:31:32] <%InugamiTheHound> does Majima from yakuza 1 count because you fight him so much and often?
[3:31:32] <%arcaderabbit48> If you fight a boss, and then fight it as a regular enemy right after, doesn't that mean its just a really upscale regular enemy?
[3:31:33] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> and take fewer hits, damn
[3:31:35] <Valdorick> Facefuck the enemy
[3:31:41] <%Tennochief> whatever happened to the ghost cat man btw?
[3:31:43] <%Louie_Salmon> Oh yeah, I guess he didn't have a health bar on top of the screen

[3:32:33] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I think it would be just a Lieutenant enemy intro. Then at the end, they throw the LTs as grunts
[3:32:35] <Mendin> This isnt a Yoko Taro game, the kids are probably still alive

[3:33:14] <%Louie_Salmon> In my experience so far, getting good ranks has a lot to do with just doing the mechanics a lot. You can take hits, as long as you're mostly doing cool shit

[3:41:24] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> lol someone salt
[3:41:31] <%dekkitout> Either that particular enemy has a less than desirable parry window, or -and this is more likely- it's easier with different stand
[3:41:34] <%1matheuw> better:restart the run
[3:41:36] <FuqBoiSlim> Real men take their stone trophies in stride
[3:41:43] <+HyperCharge_Sam> you need the arm legion to get one of those portals

[3:45:48] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat up stairs and use you stand
[3:45:52] <stormingryocan220> Pat will awaken to justice if cats are involved
[3:45:54] <+TheBitingIrish> Just jump, stupid! 4Head
[3:45:54] <b_ikki> if only you had functioning legs to jump with
[3:45:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @TheBitingIrish This seems to have more polish, FE has more time to play
[3:45:55] <conflict1914> you need time stop
[3:46:00] <+zaworldo> NO JUMP?!
[3:46:00] <This_is_Marco> LUL
[3:46:03] <Tha_Mik> No just jump
[3:46:03] <Mendin> Wasnt there a Zandatsu symbol on that dome
[3:46:05] <Hexwolf> lift?
[3:46:07] <+HyperCharge_Sam> you can't get to that other portal unless you have the arm legion
[3:46:09] <transporterthesequel> Oh the lift thing
[3:46:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> gonna have to come back later
[3:46:13] <Thalchampz> there's only chain jump
[3:46:15] <%1matheuw> you cant jump on a platinum game?? what kind of heresy is this?
[3:46:16] <transporterthesequel> There is a fork lift!
[3:46:19] <gordieda20> He can't jump like in a normal way
[3:46:22] <+zaworldo> @AngriestPat you need punch legion
[3:46:22] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yup. Time stop is the only answer
[3:46:23] <%reonome> you can legion jump
[3:46:23] <alrobot2014> police officers can't jump?
[3:46:26] <%Louie_Salmon> @thebitingirish A Persona game, or action Persona game. hmm
[3:46:26] <FrankysDream> YOU CAN PET THE TIME STOP
[3:46:28] <FuqBoiSlim> use IRIS and it'll usually tell you which legion you need
[3:46:32] <transporterthesequel> Go back, there's a fork lift!
[3:46:37] <mayorrev> clips(.***)/FaintConfidentPuffinMingLee
[3:46:38] <Valdorick> Your sister is hot
[3:46:40] <transporterthesequel> That you can probably trigger with your stand
[3:46:44] <Valdorick> by which I mean she's literally on fire.
[3:46:46] <mayorrev> tricked the system
[3:46:48] <%1matheuw> beatdown
[3:46:50] <+samsarasage> Yeeeeeah astral chain
[3:46:54] <Mendin> Stand Rush
[3:46:56] <%Louie_Salmon> Aw dang it can't have summon swords during that?
[3:46:59] <Sokumotanaka> oh she is on fire XD
[3:47:11] <This_is_Marco> shes fine guys
[3:47:11] <+Kduff89> that camera angle went fucky there
[3:47:15] <%1matheuw> wombo combo
[3:47:16] <This_is_Marco> just a little fire
[3:47:20] <%Laecerelius> Why isn't she using her stand?
[3:47:24] <%reonome> she lost it
[3:47:28] <%Laecerelius> oh
[3:47:28] <+zaworldo> She no longer has a stand
[3:47:30] <Mendin> Her stand broke free when she went to Hell Zone last stream
[3:47:34] <Sokumotanaka> @Laecerelius she lost it
[3:47:35] <%1matheuw> she lost it like some kind of nerd
[3:47:37] <+Darkred28> How are the controls in this game? A streamer I watched earlier said they were terrible.
[3:47:42] <+samsarasage> How far in are you? @angriestpat
[3:47:45] <%dalmek> I wonder if the Legion still has the swords DURING a Hit Rush?
[3:47:46] <%Dementedpenguin> Erm... is that thing suppose to look like Unit 01 or did Pat customize it? >_>
[3:47:49] <%dekkitout> Because the plot needs to build up a sibling fight, that's why
[3:47:50] <Kejang> lol scrub dudes
[3:47:54] <Mendin> The latter
[3:47:56] <+I_of_the_Storm> My main concern about this game is that it will be too short or have barely any replay like other games on this engine.
[3:47:58] <+nekodelic> YOU KILLED VEN
[3:48:02] <stormingryocan220> Can't Pat use an ability to temporarly buff his STAND attacks
[3:48:02] <%kyh9> Pat, as a heads up, the legions have differeny sync attacks with each weapon
[3:48:09] <Mendin> The Eva 01 color pack was a thing Pat found
[3:48:21] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @I_of_the_Storm It's apparently at least 24 hours, can go to 30
[3:48:29] <Saltmeisterr> @Dementedpenguin the game literally gave him eva colors
[3:48:34] <+samsarasage> There are color packs?
[3:48:37] <Kejang> @i_of_the_storm games like 20+ hours if you play casual
[3:48:38] <+HyperCharge_Sam> @I_of_the_Storm Apparently it's like 30-40 hours long
[3:48:39] <This_is_Marco> @Darkred28 controls are pretty tight, they just throw a lot at you at once. Also controlling 2 characters at once feels weird
[3:48:41] <%Louie_Salmon> @darkred28 They're great, I'm guessing he's having trouble controlling two action characters at the same time which is understandable
[3:48:46] <+Kduff89> this game is rad
[3:49:04] <%Dementedpenguin> @Saltmeisterr @Mendin Oh good to know. When I saw the colors, I was like "Wait a minute..."
[3:49:06] <%1matheuw> does this game rise the bar for stand users in action games?
[3:49:17] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> yes.
[3:49:20] <Saltmeisterr> yes
[3:49:23] <+I_of_the_Storm> Oh shit. Well then there goes that fear.
[3:49:25] <gordieda20> S Pog
[3:49:28] <%Louie_Salmon> @1matheuw Was there a stand user action game before this?

[3:50:59] <%1matheuw> all legion are evil i think
[3:50:59] <Valdorick> Because the Legions are innately evil
[3:51:00] <%Dementedpenguin> Rez loading screen o_O
[3:51:03] <Mendin> Because Legions are all unwillingly chained and hers broke free
[3:51:04] <%Louie_Salmon> You can move that btw

[3:51:05] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @InugamiTheHound evil zone corrupts
[3:51:06] <Valdorick> And they broke free of their chains
[3:51:07] <broth_elemental> Nah, she said she has this
[3:51:09] <derekwst3> @InugamiTheHound they dont want to be enslaved
[3:51:10] <%reonome> legions are just transformed chimeras so....
[3:51:10] <%arcaderabbit48> @InugamiTheHound Evil is their default state. We have our literally and figuratively chained, and he HATES IT
[3:51:11] <zv1neda> take her legion and make her SUPER SALT
[3:51:12] <FuqBoiSlim> they're all evil the blue ones are just slaves
[3:51:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound They are always evil, it's the slave chains that keep them loyal.
[3:51:17] <star_feline> These missions are LONG
[3:51:18] <Valdorick> quite literally "We can break these chains", but they did.

[3:53:39] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @InugamiTheHound No, everyone is dumb. All 5 of the stnad users jumped into an unknown rip in reality and then lost their stands. We got ours back cuz we're the protagonist
[3:53:46] <+nekodelic> CHEST
[3:53:48] <vexion_smh> chest
[3:53:52] <+Kduff89> this whole game is kiryu saying thats rad
[3:53:53] <%InugamiTheHound> @ChamoCamouflage I didn't know that. Sorry I missed a bit of the stream and didn't see all of last nights
[3:53:53] <%Laecerelius> the first crystal you hit has a chest behind it
[3:53:54] <zv1neda> wait do the chimera have Eva Angel cores PogChamp
[3:53:55] <derekwst3> chest in that dimand room on left
[3:54:01] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Wish this game isn't a switch exclusive
[3:54:06] <+Darkred28> Chests moon2L
[3:54:08] <%BoboDaHobo> just got here, is this game good?
[3:54:11] <%dalmek> @arcaderabbit48 I THINK he's gonna take an hour or so break before the co-op stream
[3:54:11] <TheLaw3D4> @Tomschiii I wish BoTW was a dollar but both these games are definitely worth their price
[3:54:15] <b_ikki> woah paige was there
[3:54:19] <$renegadehatter> Everyday we stray further from Pat's Sight
[3:54:19] <%Dementedpenguin> That scared me
[3:54:20] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound It was pretty great, I'd advise watching the VOD when you can.
[3:54:22] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> who said that
[3:54:22] <%1matheuw> is there a ghost in the room?
[3:54:24] <+Kduff89> whos talking!
[3:54:26] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat I'm 8 hours in and JUST got my second stand.
[3:54:35] <%Laecerelius> Yeah this mission has been pretty long
[3:54:35] <%Chichen> its LONG
[3:54:37] <Valdorick> The Speed run will be 50 minutes Kappa
[3:54:37] <%Louie_Salmon> The missions are crazy long for a platinum game
[3:54:41] <%InugamiTheHound> @King_Wolf_Rigger I want doggo stand
[3:54:41] <+Taivan00> oh hey zandatsu is back?
[3:54:43] <+TheBitingIrish> Stout Shako? Two refined?
[3:54:44] <alrobot2014> if this was bayo we'd already be a quarter of the way through
[3:54:45] <%Tennochief> @Chichen which stand is it?
[3:54:45] <%arcaderabbit48> This game seems super long. Also Welcome back, Paige. Assuming she ever even left
[3:54:48] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> of course..
[3:54:48] <TheHotStuven> Jebaited
[3:54:49] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat you are replaying tutorials for like 7 hours
[3:54:51] <+Darkred28> Jebaited

[3:54:56] <%Tennochief> Jebaited
[3:54:56] <+Masutasodo> A little huh
[3:54:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound That might take a long time lol
[3:54:57] <%Chichen> @zaworldo no

[3:55:08] <+zaworldo> SADNESS
[3:55:10] <stormingryocan220> I wouldn't be surprised if Platinum becomes a Nintendo exclusive company for how nice they've been treating them
[3:55:10] <FuqBoiSlim> I'm stuck on a puzzle for this section so I'm just watching pat so I can steal the answers off him 4Head
[3:55:15] <%1matheuw> why they look so organic?
[3:55:20] <DaBigVitus> he no sold it!
[3:55:20] <Sokumotanaka> molly wop hm

[3:55:38] <%Dementedpenguin> @stormingryocan220 inb4 Ubisoft buys them Kappa
[3:55:40] <%InugamiTheHound> so pat will become Giant/Huge next stream??
[3:55:41] <Kejang> @stormingryocan220 they already are, bayo 3 is switch only
[3:55:43] <zv1neda> "so I got huge"
[3:55:51] <%1matheuw> i thought they were data-ghosts-demon-thingies
[3:55:54] <mayorrev> @angriestpat one of these days you'll show up on stream all toned and buff with a manly beard and say "oh hey guys just as a heads up I was grinding at the gym a little off screen"
[3:55:59] <TheLaw3D4> @Tomschiii I think it's got atleast as much as Mario Oddysey
[3:56:00] <Sokumotanaka> @AngriestPat oh yeah don't forget to change your coat color like you wanted
[3:56:02] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound They radical as fuck, that's for sure.
[3:56:05] <Saltmeisterr> but is it as good as DMC5?
[3:56:05] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Kejang Nier dude
[3:56:07] <%kyh9> Remember what Lappy said

[3:56:39] <TheLaw3D4> @Tomschiii Worthwhile content
[3:56:45] <chaosnick007> how is the difficulty in this? and is it cuhrayzee enough?
[3:56:46] <%Louie_Salmon> You have a close-range power type stand, silly.
[3:56:50] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> He figured it out, all by himself
[3:56:56] <Kejang> @sphincter_spelunker no game since nier is multi platform, god knows when babylons fall is coming out
[3:56:58] <derekwst3> you missed secret
[3:56:59] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Get back in there and raise some lumps boyo!
[3:57:07] <FuqBoiSlim> THATS HOW YOU DO ITT???? AAHHH
[3:57:09] <stormingryocan220> This game is just a cop fighting against virtual crime lords hackers
[3:57:11] <%Dementedpenguin> This reminds me of the last stage of Gungrave. Yes I played that game to the end.... >_>
[3:57:15] <Tomschiii> @TheLaw3D4 mario isnt even something i would give 20€^^
[3:57:22] <mayorrev> give medicine to vending machine!!
[3:57:23] <+Darkred28> LUL
[3:57:23] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> nice
[3:57:25] <Ion_Laser> :D
[3:57:25] <%Tennochief> LUL
[3:57:26] <derekwst3> we need toilet paper
[3:57:29] <%Panther2103> apatSmug
[3:57:30] <ShichiNoBushi> Full Medicine Alchemist
[3:57:34] <Ion_Laser> First Try!
[3:57:35] <+nekodelic> chest
[3:57:36] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> didn't need that 140 HP
[3:57:40] <+zaworldo> So how long before someone starts steling the MC"s stand
[3:57:40] <TheLaw3D4> @Tomschiii What about Bayonetta/Nier automata?
[3:57:42] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Kejang bayo 2 was wii U, wonderful 101 was wii U, then Neir Auto came out after. Is my point
[3:57:44] <%Panther2103> apatCanada
[3:57:48] <+Darkred28> Is that EVA 01 skin a preorder bonus?
[3:57:51] <StingtheKing> Full Medicine Pharmacist.
[3:57:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Dementedpenguin So you are a man of culture as well
[3:57:53] <DracusOmega> look a consumable that pat will never use because he will need it later
[3:57:55] <%Louie_Salmon> @chaosnick007 A bit tougher than revengeance, I think. Hard to say, with the healing items and revives.
[3:58:01] <%Dementedpenguin> @doc_ock_rokc LUL
[3:58:01] <FuqBoiSlim> ironic that the mechanic the game is titled after is the worst one in the game 4Head 4Head 4Head
[3:58:05] <%Tennochief> @Darkred28 no
[3:58:12] <stormingryocan220> Soon we will get that virgil rival boss fight doodNuts
[3:58:13] <+Darkred28> Nice
[3:58:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> YO! GUNGRAVE WAS GREAT
[3:58:26] <Tomschiii> @TheLaw3D4 nier yes, bayo not so much
[3:58:27] <+zaworldo> @FuqBoiSlim you watch death note don't you
[3:58:29] <%reonome> 101? huh
[3:58:32] <b_ikki> ah yes dmc the best platinum game
[3:58:33] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat so not like TMNT?
[3:58:35] <mayorrev> DMC is platinum
[3:58:38] <Kejang> @sphincter_spelunker your point is they literally had a single non- exclusive game in like 10 years?
[3:58:39] <mayorrev> Kappa
[3:58:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Only got to play the second one though.
[3:58:41] <stormingryocan220> Would not be surprised if Akira turns into a virgil boss fight
[3:58:43] <%Louie_Salmon> Well, there is dodge offset and witch time, but yeah
[3:58:45] <%1matheuw> it looks pretty automata in terms of consumables usage
[3:58:48] <FuqBoiSlim> @zaworldo Oh, you could tell?
[3:58:48] <%InugamiTheHound> @King_Wolf_Rigger i love gungrave anime
[3:58:49] <tanarath> What about Automata?
[3:58:55] <%reonome> UI is very automata
[3:58:58] <+NitronStreams> Wonderful Revengeance Automata
[3:59:00] <+zaworldo> LUL I like you
[3:59:15] <%Laecerelius> I wonder if the dog stand will play like Okami
[3:59:19] <orangemdt> @DracusOmega no see, Pat doesn't like consumables for dot effects. He loves basic health potions
[3:59:21] <+timblenaut> they used animations from this for Nier, look at the dash and run
[3:59:24] <%hot4dukat> ok back
[3:59:27] <derekwst3> time to hit three
[3:59:27] <+I_of_the_Storm> Seems really clear they took a lot of lessons from Neir for this. I didn't even think of the chain tricks being like 101.
[3:59:29] <SulfurousAcid> get close
[3:59:30] <%Louie_Salmon> A LOT of Automata influence, as we will soon see
[3:59:30] <%reonome> you didn't even try there pat LUL
[3:59:35] <%1matheuw> look at that fuckery
[3:59:36] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound I got lucky and scooped up the box set. Then I found the second game and played the shit out of it.
[3:59:37] <%arcaderabbit48> That escalated quickly
[3:59:42] <FuqBoiSlim> The Astral 101 Automatons: Revengance
[3:59:48] <gustavozxd> ooh no
[3:59:51] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:54] <Malziel> TOLD YOU LUL
[3:59:54] <mayorrev> gyro is good
[3:59:56] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Kejang "Already exclusive" I'm just splitting hairs here. One games means they're not exclusive yet
[3:59:56] <+NitronStreams> GYRO AIMING
[4:00:01] <%reonome> YOU ONLY REALIZED THIS NOW??
[4:00:01] <%Tennochief> I'm not even going to question how
[4:00:02] <gustavozxd> oooooohhh noooooooo
[4:00:03] <Tomschiii> !uptime
[4:00:03] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 5s.
[4:00:04] <%InugamiTheHound> @King_Wolf_Rigger yeah I need to buy the dvds for some anime
[4:00:06] <TheLaw3D4> Astral Chain 2: RE:CHAIN
[4:00:09] <Malziel> Yeah it blows
[4:00:12] <FuqBoiSlim> GYRO AIM BOYSSSSSS
[4:00:12] <+timblenaut> old man pat can't handle gyro
[4:00:15] <Malziel> big un-ups for that
[4:00:19] <mayorrev> Just hold the controller still 4Head
[4:00:22] <+Shampoohyay> learn to use it granddad
[4:00:22] <internetexplorer11> invert the y axis
[4:00:22] <%Nobrev> gyro is infinitely superior
[4:00:23] <%reonome> get fucked pat LUL
[4:00:28] <Tha_Mik> git fkd
[4:00:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its okay pat I don't like Gyro aiming ether
[4:00:30] <%1matheuw> that looks like a kingdom hearts tile
[4:00:35] <%InugamiTheHound> the future is now old man, the future is gyro and furry
[4:00:36] <%1matheuw> title*
[4:00:37] <gustavozxd> I'm too lazy to move my arms around
[4:00:37] <FourthWallHammer> use gamecube controller
[4:00:43] <FuqBoiSlim> BOOMERS LITERALLY CANT HANDLE MOTION CONTROLLERS LMAOOOO
[4:00:44] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound If only they didn't cost an arm and a leg lol
[4:00:45] <TheLaw3D4> Yeah the motion controls really fixed my issues with the aiming
[4:00:48] <mateo9990> kids these days and they're gyros
[4:00:49] <%arcaderabbit48> The Wii was amazing, but its time motion control became optional. Remember when gyro controls were in Pokemon Ultra Sun and Moon, and they were the worst thing in those games?
[4:00:50] <Quietshun13> I mean you didn't even notice it before
[4:00:53] <+TheBitingIrish> Are their controller settings in the Home menu?
[4:00:56] <+Shampoohyay> (assuming these are good gyro controls) you only need to move your wrists
[4:01:00] <%InugamiTheHound> @King_Wolf_Rigger that is true dude
[4:01:00] <ShichiNoBushi> Subtle motions of the controller can be annoying. It needed to be an option as well as full controller co-op and original language.
[4:01:02] <+Shampoohyay> it's not steering a car
[4:01:24] <Zomner> PogChamp
[4:01:28] <Ocaz> twilight princess lookin different
[4:01:33] <%Dementedpenguin> Simon Belmont eat your heart out
[4:01:34] <%Laecerelius> This feels like a boss arena
[4:01:47] <%Shadicara> That's because it is
[4:01:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat so when does the director come up with his max pain speaches
[4:01:53] <%dreamfillah> what is The currency for
[4:02:00] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> nailed it
[4:02:03] <conflict1914> such skill
[4:02:03] <gustavozxd> rune factory 4(3DS) has a gyro feature for the character stats screen for some reason, every time I'm playing while lying down, the character just flies all over the place
[4:02:04] <BossFountain> this music reminds me a lot of Nier's ambient music
[4:02:05] <Ocaz> 420
[4:02:06] <%Dementedpenguin> oh my god a Castlevania PlatinumGames would be insane
[4:02:06] <%Elemntion> the only things I remember from usum were 1000 clicks of a to try and skip a 30 minute fucking cutscene to run into another one 2 steps away
[4:02:10] <%Laecerelius> he uses it to buy upgrades to his weapon and stand thingy
[4:02:14] <Kejang> buying shit?
[4:02:22] <Tomschiii> @BossFountain well, its the same composer^^
[4:02:23] <SulfurousAcid> does cleaning out the red just get you points?
[4:02:25] <+TheBitingIrish> @Dementedpenguin Fuck yea it would
[4:02:30] <%arcaderabbit48> @gustavozxd That sounds hilarious, but I'll bet in practice was infuriating
[4:02:36] <+Shampoohyay> gyro controls when the controller is also your display are terrible and come to think of it the lack of an option in this game and the fact that i mostly play in handheld
[4:02:38] <+Kduff89> need those rorbs
[4:02:41] <%Elemntion> sword and shield better have dropped the "story" in a damn pokemon game
[4:02:41] <%Shadicara> New stando
[4:02:43] <BossFountain> @Tomschiii well, that'll do it
[4:02:43] <+Shampoohyay> probably means i'm gonna hate them here

[4:03:19] <+zaworldo> it says CAPTURE
[4:03:23] <gustavozxd> @arcaderabbit48 not too much because it's not something you'll be using almost at all because it's just to look at your character in the stats screen so it's mostly just mildly annoying and pretty funny
[4:03:23] <FuqBoiSlim> INVISIVLESSED?!
[4:03:24] <Soul_Intern> DID IT BECOME INVISIBLE?
[4:03:26] <Sokumotanaka> Okay if you get this you can't grind offstream cause that would be a new stand leveling that we wouldn't see
[4:03:33] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Elemntion They didn't. You know they didn't. Gamefreak has already established there are two universes, one with Mega Evos, one without

[4:03:57] <%arcaderabbit48> @gustavozxd Oh, I misunderstood. That's not too bad then, but does still raise the question of why they made it that way
[4:03:59] <mayorrev> yoooo
[4:03:59] <Tomschiii> cant seem to find any info about the release of the ost, or is it deluxe edition exclusive?

[4:05:10] <FuqBoiSlim> for the life of me I can never get a handle the blade mode shit in this game
[4:05:10] <Thalchampz> LUL

[4:05:14] <%InugamiTheHound> @derekwst3 I saw that. I like WO4 but I never went back to get rest of the achievements
[4:05:15] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @This_is_Marco There's limited choices in every set
[4:05:24] <DrFacilier> Hiroyuki sawano?
[4:05:26] <tanarath> of course pat means to throw himself off the edge.
[4:05:31] <Mendin> This is the Bayonetta 2 composer, I think

[4:05:41] <Valdorick> Cut the barriers, maybe?
[4:05:45] <tanarath> pat, use the gun.
[4:05:52] <%Louie_Salmon> Yeah definitely
[4:05:57] <+Taglog7> SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote
[4:05:59] <DevinMayCry> The lack of release slash like revengance is what I think
[4:06:00] <%Chichen> yah the blade mode feels clunkier
[4:06:03] <%Chichen> gotta use the slowmo
[4:06:14] <+Kduff89> if this ost doesnt get on spotify or something equivalent I think i will riot.
[4:06:15] <$renegadehatter> Pat you have a GUN
[4:06:16] <derekwst3> @InugamiTheHound i dont remember why i stopped but i never finished it
[4:06:16] <%InugamiTheHound> this game is more casual than revengence
[4:06:18] <Mobilebeardunit> can this one be chained?
[4:06:18] <%Louie_Salmon> Btw you have a gun
[4:06:18] <gustavozxd> @derekwst3 hmm I heard vanilla wasn't too great cause they removed the guest characters, had a pretty sick ost tho
[4:06:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> If only there were a way to slow down time while doing ZANDATSU
[4:06:19] <Bloodhit> Are you fighting Warframes?
[4:06:21] <%kyh9> USE YOUR GUN
[4:06:27] <DevinMayCry> In revengance you rarely ever aimed both direction and angle so strictly instead using a button or a fluick of the stick to do it
[4:06:30] <+burritocheetos> do u lose stamina or something when u slow down time in blade mode?
[4:06:32] <Mendin> Wow this really is Xigbar the Evangelion Stand Frame
[4:06:33] <+zaworldo> IF ONLY YOU COULD SLOW DOWN TIME
