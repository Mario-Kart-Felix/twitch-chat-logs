[0:04:06] <+KragPlays> First time catching the stream. Bam boom drop your shield
[0:04:16] <daisymaisy02> This is actually the first NV playthrough I've ever seen with a male character, it's wild seeing the way certain interactions change
[0:04:17] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat Do the Dlc in release order.
[0:04:35] <%megamonmon123> fun fact: being a ginger gives you debuffs in all your stats except charisma which gets a huge buff
[0:04:36] <jeffishype> how
[0:04:39] <+SpookySpaghooti> whatsup shitlords
[0:04:42] <%flying_hipp0> NOT THE BEES
[0:04:47] <%Ganerumo> Haven't caught Pat's new vegas shenanigans yet, where is he at in the game ?
[0:04:58] <%ratreborn> did he just start
[0:04:59] <TootPirate> peepee
[0:05:02] <+fatal_penguin_> @winkoman I'm being a bit sarcastic but, the military is always meh. haha you'll be fine tho, the Navy isn't as bad as the other branches
[0:05:02] <%Chocolatevgz> Did he already beat vanilla? Everyone talkin dlc
[0:05:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> Now it's time for Benny, and his friends, THE JETS
[0:05:10] <%ratreborn> !uptime
[0:05:10] <+SpookySpaghooti> @Ganerumo last I remember he was doing some stuff for NCR
[0:05:10] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5m 12s.
[0:05:16] <%TheSpiritof2277> Heyya guys o/
[0:05:17] <+SpookySpaghooti> he's still in vanilla
[0:05:21] <Gruhunchously> Pat is looking to increase his karma by committing mass murder.
[0:05:22] <%Chocolatevgz> ah okay
[0:05:24] <ItsHoeJoe95> Has Pat talked about that New California mod for NV that finally came out at all/
[0:05:29] <%Chocolatevgz> I got to the Mormon Expansion I forget the name
[0:05:33] <+ShlickShlocks> vineLoog vineLoog3
[0:05:35] <daisymaisy02> I think he's just about to confront Benny?
[0:05:36] <winkoman> @chocolatevgz I figure. it's for high IQ Rick and Morty fans like me
[0:05:37] <jimmypurple> pat theres a gdq talk show now, and i want you to know im choosing you over it.
[0:05:38] <+SpookySpaghooti> but man I really wanna see him play Old World Blues
[0:05:43] <harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> honsst hearts
[0:05:44] <daisymaisy02> He's done a lot of stuff but he isn't too far in the main quest
[0:05:45] <+SpookySpaghooti> @Chocolatevgz Honest Hearts lol
[0:05:58] <%Codemaster7777> I AM NOW FULLY POOR
[0:06:00] <%Skrypto> cheer100 cheer100 Good evening Pat Paige Elmo and Chat. Hope everyone is doing well tonight.
[0:06:03] <%Codemaster7777> I LOVE IT
[0:06:06] <whalewoof> good evening ladies gentlemen
[0:06:09] <%Chocolatevgz> Yeah Honest Hearts, but by then I had leveled up so much that geckos could murder me
[0:06:09] <patismyhero> Benny from bobs outfits
[0:06:10] <%DirtyGaijin> I think he will play the DLC
[0:06:11] <%Codemaster7777> I can see now too
[0:06:12] <whalewoof> and/or*
[0:06:16] <daisymaisy02> I'm not sure why Pat doesn't seem fond of Dead Money, it's probably my fav of the NV DLC
[0:06:18] <winkoman> @fatal_penguin_ I figure it's for high IQ rick and Morty fans like me
[0:06:22] <jimmypurple> hey guys, i love all of you
[0:06:24] <%Mornaka> cheer500 Hey Pat, the D&D character I named after you successfully led a beach assault to take a port from mercenaries/slavers while on Raptor-back! (we did crash our ship into the port though)
[0:06:31] <%TheSpiritof2277> I hope he gets to OWB soon, love the tone in that
[0:06:34] <+SpookySpaghooti> hopefully Paige is on strim tonight!
[0:06:34] <Mnightshyamallama> @daisymaisy02 apparently it is because of the death collars
[0:06:37] <daisymaisy02> @jimmypurple love you too bud
[0:06:38] <%Chocolatevgz> Dead Money is one of those things people either love or hate, it seems
[0:06:47] <%Chocolatevgz> I like the casino part if I remember right?
[0:06:47] <Gruhunchously> @daisymaisy02 Dead Money is easily the most polarizing DLCs of the bunch.
[0:06:47] <%Skrypto> apatDab
[0:06:59] <%Ganerumo> @Chocolatevgz most of the DLC are like that
[0:06:59] <+redanimator> ea cancelled open world star wars game
[0:07:00] <daisymaisy02> Yeah seems like it
[0:07:01] <doctor_be> dead money might as well be its own game
[0:07:02] <%RedMaskBandit> dead money isn't that great..
[0:07:02] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> apatBig apatHoldon
[0:07:03] <%Codemaster7777> Since im now a susbibber
[0:07:09] <%OwlLightningMage> Dead Money is so good though
[0:07:11] <angeredkaazoo> I finally get to catch the stream live, yay!
[0:07:12] <daisymaisy02> I've also only ever played NV on hardcore mode lmao
[0:07:13] <+fatal_penguin_> @winkoman I had a high asvab test and I remember my recruiter being super upset that I jiust wanted an infantry mos.
[0:07:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> @redanimator NOT AGAIN
[0:07:17] <winkoman> chat is too fast for me
[0:07:18] <jimmypurple> i adore dead money
[0:07:18] <$Mendin> Do fight DLC yeah
[0:07:20] <%AncelDeLambert> Dead Money is amazing
[0:07:20] <%OwlLightningMage> Honestg Hearts is the weakest one
[0:07:20] <%presidentpres> apatHoldon apatHoldon apatHoldon
[0:07:20] <%Chocolatevgz> I hated the first part cause I kept accidentally stepping into instant kill spots
[0:07:22] <%yoshkosh20> just got here. we just starting?
[0:07:23] <%snow_bush> @Chocolatevgz It's OK, the main issues are that it steals your shit, puts an intstakill gimmick in, and is just generally irritating
[0:07:24] <b1gboss007> press 1 for no audio press 2 for audio

[0:07:25] <doctor_be> Pat will probably like it, considering it is heavy on the survival horror vibes
[0:07:25] <%Chocolatevgz> Casino was fun tho
[0:07:26] <+JabaTheFat> dead money is cool imo but flawed/annoying in quite a few ways
[0:07:28] <%DirtyGaijin> apatWhat apatHoldon
[0:07:30] <%megamonmon123> anyone excited for the indie game resident evil 2 remake?
[0:07:31] <+SpookySpaghooti> Dead Money has some good ideas but it isn't the soundest or fairest

[0:07:51] <%OwlLightningMage> I love the characters in Dead Money more than the other DLCs. Including best gurl Ulysses
[0:07:52] <+Flambage> Dead money is fun the first time but tiring on multiple playthroughs
[0:07:53] <veldinmusic> Yooo
[0:07:56] <Gruhunchously> I really like Dead Money because I love the characters and atmosphere, and my tolerance for unfair bullshit is quite high.

[0:19:45] <%Codemaster7777> @AngriestPat I just pre-orderd REmake2 Deluxe, DMCV Deluxe, AND Shadows Die Twice. My Wallet Hurts Pat
[0:19:46] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat you can pick only 1 as a sponsor do you pick Red Bull, or Doritos
[0:19:47] <%aochoa2005> cheer100
[0:19:49] <%PipIV> this is for Matilda
[0:19:50] <dj_rej3ct> Resident Evil 2 Remake would even be fine for fucks sake lol
[0:19:52] <ItsHoeJoe95> Resident Evil 2: Residenter Evilererer
[0:19:54] <Fujiwara_92> B U R S T
[0:19:56] <$nademonkey1100> @kiiiirsten anything our for harambe should be a worldwide holiday
[0:20:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> rah
[0:20:00] <evbites> where did leon get the Matilda from
[0:20:00] <%RaikenTB> the colt is godlike.
[0:20:02] <ASadFrog> To be fair, aren't REmake and RE Remake just fan names? The remake of the first one was just called Resident Evil or Biohazard just like the original.
[0:20:04] <doctor_be> you know the answer to that, he will never have to reach for red bull ever again
[0:20:05] <RCtiger0> Bursting from the bullet seams
[0:20:08] <Desertfishing> Pat did you clean up the gamer goo from last stream
[0:20:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> Resident Evil 2: Die Harder
[0:20:11] <%PipIV> R I F L E B U R S T
[0:20:13] <Fujiwara_92> Vampyr is cool
[0:20:17] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> ASS FIRE
[0:20:18] <Bouldus> vampyr looked like some prime jenk
[0:20:19] <%connos_livereview> @AngriestPat clares j frame 5 shot in the new game lloks like a nerf but her old gun is also available later
[0:20:23] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat should stream Wasteland 2 so that he'll actually finish it LUL
[0:20:23] <Bouldus> in a good way
[0:20:23] <HefestoForges> also they look almost the same
[0:20:24] <%Remery_> Not any fire
[0:20:27] <%PipIV> oh boy
[0:20:28] <+fatal_penguin_> College is for chods
[0:20:28] <cant_pick_a_name> congrats
[0:20:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> What a rebel
[0:20:30] <%hawk_rush> DAMN
[0:20:30] <%Afterman_> vampyr is somewhat jank, but a really good jank
[0:20:30] <HeadsHeldHigh> Yeesh

[0:20:39] <Estuko> FeelsBadMan
[0:20:39] <%connos_livereview> woof
[0:20:39] <doctor_be> Is there a story behind that?
[0:20:40] <+Aeoneth> Spoilers: that's why he got kicked out
[0:20:43] <ASadFrog> Also, as a gun person, people calling the VP-70 a Hi-Point during Pat's stream was painful
[0:20:43] <%Bailey__gaming> Vampyr is a fun game, the no murder run is hard tho
[0:20:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> Resident Evil 2: Cruise Control
[0:20:45] <%pimpinahz> Resident Evil 2: The deader dead are dead
[0:20:46] <Samuel412> Vampyr is a good game, but it's shockingly derivative of Bloodborne.
[0:20:47] <dave323dave> always look on the bright side of life
[0:20:48] <%Remery_> College sucks but I really want to be a Butcher
[0:20:50] <Fujiwara_92> search buddy?
[0:20:53] <%PipIV> college dropout > high school dropout
[0:20:54] <%ElenaManetta> I liked that remix on Twitter

[0:21:06] <%Afterman_> i did a no murder run first, but then decided to go full on immoral vamp on my 2nd run, very fun
[0:21:07] <%OwlLightningMage> I'm glad they're continuing the podcast and still being wrong about things LUL

[0:21:22] <%PipIV> Beast M A I L
[0:21:23] <%TheSpiritof2277> You hear that remix they made of Paige singing the theme
[0:21:25] <legoaisu> highly anticipated
[0:21:25] <Samuel412> Same aesthetics, same combat but shallower, also about vampires but less subtle about it. It's odd.
[0:21:27] <+WizardofWazz> totally
[0:21:29] <dekkitout> that theme song is s tier
[0:21:30] <%pimpinahz> NOM NOM NOM
[0:21:32] <%ElenaManetta> Dorito chuckles
[0:21:34] <%Remery_> sucks that you have to be a subscriber to watch the vods tho :/
[0:21:38] <%gus_hornblende> i've had paige's version of the theme stuck in my head
[0:21:42] <%TheSpiritof2277> me too

[0:21:56] <$codussalpha> cloth paper
[0:21:58] <pakuman> It's made of SHIN PAPER
[0:21:58] <%Shonen_hero> that's a terrible thing to make money out of
[0:21:58] <$anime_boyz> cheer500 Hey Pat how should I get this missed fan art to you if I don't wanna make another tweet about it?
[0:21:58] <%pimpinahz> I had to get doritoes. damn you Pat!!
[0:21:58] <%Afterman_> @Samuel412 ? i mustve missed ur first message, what were you specifically talking about
[0:21:58] <+JackMillerTime> hemp
[0:21:59] <lloyddboy> you can literally launder money
[0:22:00] <%brave_sj> Paper is too easy to counterfeit
[0:22:01] <%OwlLightningMage> It can't literally be paper. It would fall apart to shit
[0:22:03] <yourliteraldog> You can wash it
[0:22:03] <%PapaSatanSangLouie> That's why it can survive going through the wash.

[0:36:32] <%kiiiirsten> "I didn't know heavy armor made me heavier" - Pat
[0:36:32] <%ElenaManetta> Loading screens in this game makes me nervous. Soft crashes during loading was about 99% of the reason the game crashed for me.
[0:36:33] <doctor_be> this vault is the best writing
[0:36:37] <nobody12349> What are we? Some kind of Suicide Vault?

[0:38:02] <%aivalera> Trust me Pat, the rad vault is way, way worse
[0:38:03] <PSI_Guy95> Three of these voices are the exact same
[0:38:03] <CrabSlacks> this is why I always carry a recharger pistol, waste of ammo shooting rats with real bullets

[0:38:33] <%brave_sj> Like I would have but that guy was in it for the fuckin science
[0:38:35] <Gruhunchously> The funny thing is, this Vault employs pretty much the same storytelling techniques as Fallout; 76. It just does it better. A lot better.
[0:38:37] <Dragonfang1337> I think you just help the NCR and fuck over legions for boone points
[0:38:37] <doctor_be> only 4 bodies

[0:42:21] <Samuel412> One of the the things that make this Vault so fascinating is that the Vault dwellers invented the overseer rule. It was supposed to just be deciding a person to die, but they got into their heads that it should always be the overseer.
[0:42:23] <BourneWarrior> Pick up the syringes Pat
[0:42:23] <$Tuskor13> Who the fuck leaves empty syringes in a first aid kit
[0:42:24] <dukenux> ED-E will ensure the "Non organic" ending
[0:42:29] <Coystick> The fact that he floats thus avoiding 99% of pathfinding jank AI companions usually suffer from makes ED-E so much cooler

[0:44:03] <jijipose> To be MORE BROKEN
[0:44:07] <nobody12349> The big twist in Vault 11 is that all the dwellers are actually giant mantises and you've been murdering them.

[0:44:09] <Sabercry> ED-E is a monster
[0:44:11] <+xBitWolf> what mods is he running? i've been wanting to play this again.
[0:44:12] <Samuel412> @Gruhunchously exactly. It's one of the only Vaults where the dwellers themselves add to the experiment, inadvertently making their own lives way worse.
[0:44:12] <Gruhunchously> If I recall, this Vault contains the one instance of Steve Blum in this game.
[0:44:12] <%manwithboxonhead> Melee Snipers
[0:44:14] <Gorgen> Mantises are exactly tough enemies
[0:44:17] <%thebonebard> so the companions are basically stnads

[0:54:25] <dukenux> its bullshit
[0:54:27] <Mr_Strut> ED-E has to exert downward force on the ground to remain floating. It could theoretically set off a trap.
[0:54:28] <%manwithboxonhead> ED-E’s Ego is so apatBig
[0:54:28] <Gruhunchously> ED-E really should have the Light Step perk by default.

[1:00:54] <%PaladinDupre> ED-E lost
[1:00:56] <yourliteraldog> There hasn't been a Bethesda game devolved in house that wasn't buggy
[1:01:01] <%vectorless_peon> bethesdas gambryo engine was old when FONV was hot
[1:01:01] <carlmonte> Bethesda PS3 games are one of 9 circles of hell
[1:01:02] <Gruhunchously> Fallout was buggy. Fallout 2 was even worse. Fallout 3 was Bethesda, New Vegas was Bethesda/Obsidian x2. Fallout 4 was Fallout 4. Fallout 76 is barely functional.
[1:01:02] <%gus_hornblende> ah fuck it, guess i'm gonna boot up new vegas too now
[1:01:02] <jijipose> Thats half the charm
[1:01:03] <segychan> the game was rigged from the start!
[1:01:05] <Reckeler> New Vegas tends to do that
[1:01:06] <$Tuskor13> This is literally the only reason I prefer playing Fallout 4 to New Vegas. If 4 crashes I just close the window. If New Vegas crashes I have to restart my computer.
[1:01:07] <CrabSlacks> they starved

[1:01:26] <damiensiegfried> SMOrc SMOrc
[1:01:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> It was actually the Anti-Crust
[1:01:30] <$PaleBloodInk> And an 18 month development time.
[1:01:30] <+Grayhammatter> i hope it's good
[1:01:31] <evbites> yes he has puppets
[1:01:35] <natebud> I've never seen it run this bad. I think the mods might have done something
[1:01:35] <%President_Miyazaki> Or kneecapped by the short dev time.
[1:01:37] <+HunkleberryFine> and the publisher
[1:01:37] <%DirtyGaijin> Plus Obsidian is much better at making games
[1:01:38] <PSI_Guy95> @AngriestPat Are you gonna play Outer Worlds on release?
[1:01:38] <%ThatGuyfromMars> its easy to believe that Gamebryo is a 20 year old engine
[1:01:41] <%Shonen_hero> this engine sucks
[1:01:42] <$Tuskor13> Mantis Toboggan
[1:01:44] <%OwlLightningMage> I had Fallout 4 crash on me a ton in Far Harbor

[1:01:50] <KeystoneA1> Well it's being written by people who put their pronouns in their Twitter bios so I'm not expecting much.
[1:01:51] <%CollinsOfBodom> @garbagequeenellie you more or less go through the vaults and find lore as you go.
[1:01:53] <%PipIV> more blum?
[1:01:53] <%TheSpiritof2277> I'll just be happy to play a class-act game without worrying about ALT-TABing fucking up my game. That's my biggest grip with NV

[1:04:08] <theaplombman> Betty
[1:04:09] <%LocDogX86X> wasn't that the key
[1:04:10] <%sparrrow_> Pat is such a god damn idiot

[1:04:10] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat did you EVEN go into the room you U N L O C K E d?
[1:04:10] <nolzee> Pass is Belly
[1:04:11] <TheEnablerr> This was the vault that actually made me realize just how FUCKED Robco and Vault-Tec were.
[1:04:12] <Gruhunchously> Read the thing again.
[1:04:12] <%ElenaManetta> Hello Betty
[1:04:13] <DonatelloJose> @angriestpat you’re super right, my only recourse is to leave, and I’d rather not because I like you!
[1:04:16] <Dozale> Is Doritos paying you? Cos the ad's working, ima gonna buy 2 bags as soon as morning comes.
[1:04:16] <nobody12349> Spawn in the key with console commands
[1:04:18] <blankwaffle> l2read babe
[1:04:18] <Fujiwara_92> betty
[1:04:21] <TheRowerman> its Foolsoot Ner Vargoose
[1:04:22] <MKUltima> Maybe the password was the friends we made along the way
[1:04:23] <%Kahnicus> you learn it by reading the ombudsman's speech
[1:04:24] <%Jjrossman> Isn't betty a womans name?
[1:04:25] <%Kahnicus> betsy
[1:04:27] <debugdrawray_> @AngriestPat any plans on doing warframe heists on stream
[1:04:28] <nolzee> It's easy to miss give him a break
[1:04:28] <%ElenaManetta> Noclip
[1:04:30] <Gorgen> the password is Friendship
[1:04:32] <%DirtyGaijin> Maybe the password was the friends we killed along the way
[1:04:33] <segychan> is salsa verde the best dorito? i think yes
[1:04:35] <alrobot2014> the door you opened?
[1:04:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> u love the shithole
[1:04:41] <Gruhunchously> Yeah there is, but hell if I remember what it is.
[1:04:44] <%LocDogX86X> there is but GL finding it
[1:04:45] <The_Blumper> crawl through the trash like it was your destiny
[1:04:45] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat password is in the speech you just read, also I connected my discord account but the server isnt showing up where its supposed to
[1:04:48] <evbites> Remember there where two vaults where one was 99 females and 1 male and the other was the absolute worse
[1:04:48] <%lewdskeletor13> The password is the friends we made along the way
[1:04:54] <Gruhunchously> You gotta unlock a door or something.
[1:05:12] <$SereneFox> Who else is happy that the treasure in One Piece has been confirmed to NOT be friendship?
[1:05:14] <yourliteraldog> It is a plot thing all vaults except a few of them where social experiments. There where vaults actually designed for the purpose of housing people like vault 8 and 76
[1:05:18] <%Kahnicus> 99 females and 1 male would be viable as long as you the younger males breed with the older females
[1:05:21] <alrobot2014> the password is the friends we sacrificed to the computer along the way
[1:05:23] <PSI_Guy95> I don't think Pat made any friends in this vault
[1:05:23] <%pimpinahz> @lewdskeletor13 the password is the people we were assholes too along the way... prepare for a long list
[1:05:28] <Coystick> Ghost Paige

[1:05:41] <%kiiiirsten> Yeahhhh let's get sacrificed woo!
[1:05:41] <+TheMattman1313> Pat hates getting shot by ghosts.

[1:05:47] <%lewdskeletor13> Elmo the Ghost Whisperer
[1:05:48] <Gruhunchously> I would like to point out that the Vaults being experiments was kind of a retcon that Fallout 2 did.
[1:05:50] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat the ghosts of all the kids you jizzed away
[1:05:50] <hntronium> the passwords were inside you all along
[1:05:52] <Thoravis> he will betray you to the ghosts, he's ghost faction aligned

[1:05:54] <Jaxnos> who just nonchalantly opens a sacrificial chamber? D:
[1:05:54] <ItsHoeJoe95> Sacrifical chamber? I wonder what happens in there
[1:05:55] <$Tuskor13> Don't worry, any ghosts that might be at your house are simply trying to get directions to Woolie's place for his Haunting.

[1:11:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ...why???

[1:11:43] <Dozale> Mines are again Yours.
[1:11:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> I think an electric chair would've been more ideal
[1:11:45] <%Chocolatevgz> the gas is in the next room as a failsafe in case this doesn't do the job
[1:11:45] <CrabSlacks> Do you think the robots ate them?
[1:11:47] <%OwlLightningMage> Time for the best part of this vault LUL
[1:11:52] <nolzee> So what do you get for doing this?

[1:12:09] <dekkitout> oh yeah, then this twilight zone shit
[1:12:09] <alexandrecau> Like if you clean up the chamber from corpse and see bullets assume that there is no gas
[1:12:09] <Gruhunchously> I wonder what it will say?
[1:12:10] <zerocruz> FUCK YOU MOOBOT
[1:12:10] <%ElenaManetta> Like everytime they want to sacrifice someone they have to get a new chair and shit because the robots would obviously have shot the other one to shit

[1:19:57] <%GoogleyGareth> A lot of the corporate companies in Fallout were super evil.
[1:20:00] <Reckeler> Vault-Tech: Because Fuck you
[1:20:00] <alrobot2014> i never realized there were only 4 shots
[1:20:01] <%rdark_ksu> i still feel like the whole vault test thing needs a little more explanation
[1:20:01] <%OwlLightningMage> There are monsters due on maple street shit PogChamp
[1:20:02] <DonatelloJose> Is this the worst vault test?
[1:20:04] <$Tuskor13> It's just a prank bro. It's a SOCIAL EXPERIMENT.
[1:20:04] <Gruhunchously> @Aztec50 Yes, there are control vaults that didn't have any experiment going on. Vault 101 was one. So was Vault 13.
[1:20:06] <Coystick> Vault Tec are the Chemicals your Alex warned you about.
[1:20:06] <%OwlLightningMage> LUL
[1:20:08] <%ronyncato87> Vault Tec dropped the bombs, per one fan theory
[1:20:09] <silverglove2012> there is a theory that aliens started it
[1:20:09] <damiensiegfried> no, not by a long shot
[1:20:10] <privatesargent> i never understood Valut Tec's purpose, "hey lets make these nuclear shelters into experiments"... but why? whats the point of that
[1:20:10] <%DirtyGaijin> Im surprised Pat isnt using a shotgun
[1:20:15] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @DonatelloJose no. the worst was 1 woman, 99 men
[1:20:15] <+KR_Black> @angriestpat was Vault Tech evil or amoral ?
[1:20:16] <%Chocolatevgz> a lot of the corporations were evil in fallout, just like in real life
[1:20:16] <%NovaKnightmare> and Vaulttec lived on with the Enclave too
[1:20:16] <TranquilTurnip> Did pat get to see the ffull storyline? about how they voted and who they voted and the civil war aspect?
[1:20:17] <+TheMattman1313> Another question is WHEN did the experiment end.
[1:20:17] <Izuurus> hubris brah
[1:20:18] <%kiiiirsten> The best Fallout vault is the one that makes me hallucinate seeing my dad again hahaha...ha...
[1:20:19] <%TheSpiritof2277> Democracy made them play themselves tbh apatSmug
[1:20:20] <%lewdskeletor13> Nah the Vault Tests we’re only there to help the Enclave survive
[1:20:23] <Willfordbrimly> Omg did VaultTech cause the water just to be a to run their experiments?
[1:20:23] <CuttleCrow> Vault 68 and 69 were ok if I remember
[1:20:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> Would the "For Science" trope be considered Lawful or Neutral Evil?
[1:20:24] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat they're basically a group of social scientists who lucked out and got free human trials approval. rooKek
[1:20:26] <%pimpinahz> @ronyncato87 that wouldn't surprise me

[1:20:28] <+SpookySpaghooti> @privatesargent evil corporation is evil
[1:20:30] <%Niney_Who> Whenever someone tries to say how nice the world was before the bombs fell I just remind them that "They shot hippies in the streets."
[1:20:30] <Kriptin> Vault 101 wasn't a control vault, it was meant to never open again.
[1:20:33] <Beheziel> found it! The Milgram Experiment
[1:20:33] <zafooru> G A M B L
[1:20:34] <dukenux> Which corp is worse : Vault Tec or Umbrella... or Weyland Yutani
[1:20:35] <%ItsRatman> cheer200 Super Beast, Super Beast, live from Castle Super Beast. He is good and he is sweet. We give Elmo lots of beeps.
[1:20:35] <damiensiegfried> the worst vault test was the one turned everyone into super mutants
[1:20:37] <Gruhunchously> @privatesargent Allegedly, it was big plan on the Enclave's part to prepared people for space travel.
[1:20:38] <%Fadedblank247> wasn't as bad as vault 55, where everyone had to play chaos legion all day
[1:20:39] <alexandrecau> get a dog?
[1:20:40] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat what did you expect them to lock people in a nuclear bunker and NOT fuck with them for SCIENCE?!?!
[1:20:43] <%Jon64s> Gambling
[1:20:45] <nolzee> The BoS in New Vegas are big lamoes
[1:20:46] <grimnier> Didnt the government order the social experiment vaults?
[1:20:49] <viciousgrim> everyone in the vault had a chance to stop it
[1:20:51] <%Chocolatevgz> The dog I didn't know about until playthrough 3
[1:20:51] <%Kahnicus> i like the convenient fast travel markers mod
[1:20:53] <%3xgilly> Pat play 76
[1:20:55] <%pectusumbra> @ThePuddingDead they were threatened to sacrifice a person each year. Only when there was nearly no one left did they refuse and find out it was all a test
[1:20:55] <raminnoodle420> But Science tho
[1:20:57] <daisymaisy02> @privatesargent they're just pieces of shit who don't care even a little bit about humanity and basically used this opportunity to do every fucked experiment they were interested in
[1:20:59] <segychan> is it doctorin time?
[1:21:01] <damiensiegfried> the BoS are always lameos
[1:21:01] <KangarooCyborg> !uptime
[1:21:02] <CuttleCrow> The really fucked vaults were the ones that were meant to leak rads early
[1:21:02] <Oxybe> So is pat going NCR this playthrough?
[1:21:02] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 21m.
[1:21:02] <evbites> umbrella

[1:21:05] <$SleepyMaribo> hey... at least it wasnt vault 69....
[1:21:05] <TheEnablerr> Being real though, what was the point of the social experiments when no one was going to be alive to care or study the results afterwards.
[1:21:08] <dekkitout> if by government you mean enclave, then yes, they did
[1:21:09] <%pimpinahz> BIG CRITS
[1:21:09] <DonatelloJose> I suppose that is like the Millgrim experiment

[1:21:33] <Gruhunchously> Framerate is sad.
[1:21:36] <%Kahnicus> @TheEnablerr the enclave was around to study the end results till after fallout 2
[1:21:36] <%Laecerelius> Put that AIDS need right in my veins, doc!
[1:21:36] <alrobot2014> @TheEnablerr there were some faults that weren't used for experiments iirc
[1:21:41] <Izuurus> because dramatic irony
[1:21:42] <mercado94> punch the computer
[1:21:42] <alexandrecau> you know they shouldn't face the wall in a post apocalyptic world you'll get shot in the back so fast
[1:21:43] <Beheziel> oops! that syringe is just full of air
[1:21:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> its not the same if you don't rotate them yourself
[1:21:44] <%lewdskeletor13> Vault Tec was in league with the Enclave, the tests were used for data to help them survive
[1:21:44] <%BLACKHALO9> holy shit she had fuckin massive hands

[1:22:02] <DisGuyOvahEre> hey pat how do you feel that woolie never rotates his saves on his lps when you guys aren't looking
[1:22:04] <TranquilTurnip> There were extremely few controls however
[1:22:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> Vault 11 is why Americans hate government
[1:22:05] <QaizerArt> Did Pat get to see how stupid the end of that one vault was?
[1:22:06] <%pimpinahz> @angriestpat Its Vault-Tech who is screwing with your frame rate
[1:22:06] <zerocruz> Did he do Vault 22 yet ?

[1:23:09] <%Chocolatevgz> did vault 68 ever make it into a game or are the implications too disgusting?
[1:23:10] <zafooru> ooOOooo
[1:23:10] <%ItsRatman> spooky caravaner
[1:23:11] <SilverJakler> this game is haunted
[1:23:11] <%ThePuddingDead> grhooostssts
[1:23:15] <The_Sorrow_> WutFace
[1:23:18] <CrabSlacks> you just got possessed
[1:23:18] <%PROUD2beGINGER> SPOOK
[1:23:19] <dukenux> So @AngriestPat did you decide which DLC do first
[1:23:20] <hassanico> @AngriestPat SHe's asleep dude
[1:23:20] <%CollinsOfBodom> IIRC vaults in general, control or experimental, simply weren't meant or even designed to be 100% safe.
[1:23:20] <%pimpinahz> Ghost Peepus to fuck
[1:23:22] <Xordanus> Pet the Perv
[1:23:24] <%OwlLightningMage> Ghosts WutFace
[1:23:25] <Xordanus> *Pat
[1:23:26] <dukenux> "Yeah, hes in the batchroom"
[1:23:27] <%SiameseSneeze> probably sleeping
[1:23:27] <KeystoneA1> She sleeps in the worker barracks
[1:23:28] <yourliteraldog> show feet while playing carvan
[1:23:28] <+KR_Black> ah the caravan ... i remember whe i killed everyone in there
[1:23:28] <%PaladinDupre> ROB THEM
[1:23:29] <zafooru> commie ghosts
[1:23:32] <Gruhunchously> @Chocolatevgz No, vault 68 is just backround lore, thank goodness.
[1:23:32] <+drbuttghost825> shes asleep pat
[1:23:33] <%Jjrossman> magazine on the floor in bathroom
[1:23:33] <Mnightshyamallama> very easy lock

[1:23:33] <Beheziel> alice laugh fartly
[1:23:34] <%JoeJotaro> "Dorm Invasion"
[1:23:34] <yourliteraldog> lol
[1:23:36] <daisymaisy02> @Chocolatevgz I think it only exists cos a comic that later became canon included it as a joke
[1:23:36] <CuttleCrow> vault 68: 999 men and 1 woman
[1:23:36] <%Kahiir> creepy
[1:23:37] <SilverJakler> Pet the Parv
[1:23:38] <%BlackJack607> Lets stare at her while she sleeps!
[1:23:38] <Kriptin> Nothing is canon with Bethesda, they'll change everything on a whim to sell a game.
[1:23:43] <dekkitout> theres also the vault where the door partially closed -intentionally- when the bombs fell
[1:23:44] <daisymaisy02> So I really doubt it'll ever be in a game
[1:23:47] <%PaladinDupre> SHE CAN HEAR YOU
[1:23:51] <%kiiiirsten> brows..........
[1:23:52] <%ThePuddingDead> that a dude?
[1:23:53] <AwkwardRenegade> totally not weird and stalky
[1:23:53] <SilverJakler> I don't like him
[1:23:53] <Gruhunchously> And Vault 69, 999 women and 1 man.
[1:23:54] <dukenux> McLafferty is kinda cunt
[1:23:54] <TheEnablerr> @Kahnicus never got around to playing the first 2 fallouts so now that makes more sense to me. I knew about the control vaults Pat mentioned but I meant in the sense of "Hey, we got the data now let's make it worth something in the future 200-300 years from now when society is re-established and we're not there to see it"
[1:23:55] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@zafooru) (warning)

[1:30:28] <%joylent_blue> whichever Vault it is that has all the radiation is the worst by far but this one is also bad
[1:30:30] <daisymaisy02> No insult intended huh
[1:30:32] <dukenux> Absolutely intended
[1:30:33] <Mnightshyamallama> to be fair most mercs that would come in and take this job probably aren't very into computers

[1:30:43] <CuttleCrow> Vault 22 is awesome, I dont get the hate
[1:30:44] <alrobot2014> the best part of vault 22 is the AER 14 prototype
[1:30:49] <Izuurus> incoming nuclear dustbowl
[1:30:52] <%OwlLightningMage> Boone needs to be the center of attention LUL
[1:30:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> No. Shut up
[1:30:53] <%pimpinahz> ok now Fuck them all. Ask Boone for help
[1:30:53] <JetpackMcQuack> What if we gave plants hands so they could water themselves?

[1:31:00] <%kiiiirsten> @botchamaniac Vault 101 was doing pretty good until Dad decided to fuck it up
[1:31:00] <Gruhunchously> He's right in the next room.
[1:31:03] <daisymaisy02> Okay her face looks better now
[1:31:04] <%Chocolatevgz> I enjoyed 22, but I remember it taking forever, either cause I kept dying or cause the game kept buggin out

[1:31:44] <%manwithboxonhead> It’s a lot like that.
[1:31:44] <%ItsRatman> Vault 22 is great on first playthrough, but on repeat playthroughs I skip it. It just drags on and on.

[1:32:32] <Izuurus> it's not nice to ask a lady her age
[1:32:36] <%bvanbove> Fuck I really want to play this game again. But with a PC that can't run it and it not being on PS4....time to dust off the PS3.

[1:33:34] <%Chocolatevgz> Sounds like Hildern needs a fuckin bullet
[1:33:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Gruhunchously In this game, EVERYTHING has lesbian subtext

[1:34:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Gruhunchously True
[1:34:16] <DSD24> Dr Hildern is a cool doctor name

[1:34:30] <MoulesFritz> i will read lesbian subtext in literally anything
[1:34:32] <DSD24> Anders the worst Dragon Age character
[1:34:33] <evbites> back to hilbern
[1:34:37] <MoulesFritz> it's ,y greatest strength
[1:34:39] <damiensiegfried> vault 22 is easily in the top five of worst vaults
[1:34:40] <dukenux> Hsu looks actually alright
[1:34:42] <Gruhunchously> Lesbians and Plant Zombies. It really is The Last of Us.
[1:34:43] <AlasterAngelo> @DSD24 you are correct
[1:34:44] <%joylent_blue> Anders and his fucking cat
[1:34:48] <damiensiegfried> hi red
[1:34:50] <%Chocolatevgz> rip Anders, the greatest sequel character assassination of our time
[1:34:52] <%joylent_blue> VoHiYo
[1:34:55] <natebud> He did manage to slip out
[1:34:59] <%OwlLightningMage> Sir Pounce A lot is the best character
[1:35:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> If anime has taught us anything, it's that lesbianism sells itself
[1:35:02] <CrabSlacks> But Anders was so sneaky!
[1:35:03] <DSD24> @AlasterAngelo He was cool in Awakening then he got bad
[1:35:07] <alrobot2014> how did they manage to kill anders so much
[1:35:16] <hassanico> Oh I remember now
[1:35:21] <%ZeOrbling> !uptime
[1:35:21] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 35m.
[1:35:21] <hassanico> This base has nothing but beans for food
[1:35:21] <%Chocolatevgz> DA2 was rushed as hell, iirc
[1:35:22] <dukenux> Did you fix the cooking thing?
[1:35:25] <%Chocolatevgz> And also just notgood
[1:35:25] <TranquilTurnip> Vault 3 got a raw deal
[1:35:26] <%OwlLightningMage> Anders was the best in Awakening .
[1:35:30] <dekkitout> time for tort- i mean interrogation
[1:35:31] <Gruhunchously> Does this guy look Asian? At all?
[1:35:32] <alrobot2014> and how did they make him less likable than loghain
[1:35:36] <dukenux> You probly can do it no problem with 90 repair
[1:35:37] <AlasterAngelo> @DSD24 The entire series got bad after Awakening
[1:35:46] <hassanico> @Gruhunchously Slightly? Kinda?
[1:35:51] <MoulesFritz> da2 anders was great, we nuked the templars together and then fucked over their rotting corpses
[1:35:52] <Izuurus> he looked more asian in vanilla
[1:35:54] <%FrostMass22> The templars in DA were right
[1:35:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fair enough
[1:36:00] <DSD24> @AlasterAngelo Eh Inquisition has some good parts its way better than DA2
[1:36:05] <AlasterAngelo> The templars in DA were absolutely right
[1:36:09] <TheEnablerr> I imagine 200 year old salisbury steak and instamash every day would give you a serious case of the runs.
[1:36:09] <%Chocolatevgz> I liked how the mage rebellion was full of people wanting to resist demonic corruption until the end when their leader is like give me
[1:36:23] <%pimpinahz> hmmm Persona Mod in New Vegas or Skyrim...hmmmmm Persona waifu kn skyrim
[1:36:25] <%Chocolatevgz> (I didn't like that)
[1:36:30] <sirrice77> oh god the chips
[1:36:32] <Sloavon> templars are always full of shit
[1:36:36] <JetpackMcQuack> "pssst... In 10 minutes, Steve's gonna be alone in the port-a-potty"
[1:36:42] <%DirtyGaijin> The doritos never end
[1:36:43] <%OwlLightningMage> The Templars are only right if you do that fucking time travel mission in Inquistion LUL
[1:36:44] <dekkitout> @pimpinahz oh, you know youd always choose serana LU
[1:36:44] <Gruhunchously> Lt. Laura Bailey.
[1:36:45] <Finakala> New Vegas is actually a good game unlike Skyrim, so that I guess
[1:36:45] <+SpookySpaghooti> whats the deal with the templars in DA?
[1:36:46] <%Keeble24> almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter
[1:36:49] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat you have to get the guy killed to get a boone point
[1:36:57] <AlasterAngelo> @Chocolatevgz even before then he funds a literal serial killer. Fuck mages
[1:36:59] <Gruhunchously> Laura Bailey is three people in this game and they're all great.
[1:36:59] <%Chocolatevgz> FUCK I forgot there was time travel in DA:I
[1:37:04] <%pimpinahz> @dekkitout lol hell no. Naoto-kun

[1:37:09] <+SpookySpaghooti> Laura Bailey is a wonderful person
[1:37:11] <alexandrecau> Boone has enough boone point as it is
[1:37:12] <%OwlLightningMage> The time travel mission is super nuts LUL
[1:37:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> Feed different false info to every group, like Commander Erwin Smith did, to narrow down who the traitors are.
[1:37:13] <DSD24> @OwlLightningMage Is that the one where you go save the mages instead of the templars?
[1:37:15] <evbites> and now your mine
[1:37:22] <%DirtyGaijin> There is time travel in DA:I?
[1:37:22] <%OwlLightningMage> @DSD24 Yep

[1:37:34] <Goldenwolf98> @Chocolatevgz Time Travel is in DA 2 as well
[1:37:35] <sirrice77> @spookyspaghooti templars are just really strict and dogmatic which becomes fanaticism after the mages constant explode into demons on purpose
[1:37:36] <TranquilTurnip> I always do the templar mission in DAI
[1:37:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> Waifu wars also sell themselves
[1:37:40] <%joylent_blue> limited time travel that doesn't affect much DirtyGaijin

[1:38:04] <%lewdskeletor13> SPY KIDS?

[1:38:35] <%OwlLightningMage> Inquistion was alright. Way better than 2
[1:38:36] <slothslayer828> BUG EYED
[1:38:42] <alrobot2014> @DSD24 nah the worst part is playing as a Dalish elf and having both Morrigan AND Solas EXPLAIN DALISH LORE TO YOU
[1:38:43] <MoulesFritz> @AngriestPat this is New Vegas's buggiest quest, be careful
[1:38:43] <%pimpinahz> DA Origins was the best one
[1:38:52] <%Chocolatevgz> Actually yeah this is buggy
[1:38:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> The worst part of Dragon Age Inquisition is that it acts like Cullen is anything but a pathetic waste of Oxygen
[1:39:01] <%OwlLightningMage> Origins is the best one and Inquistion is second best
[1:39:02] <+InugamiTheHound> I love dragon age origins, DA2 and Inquisition. I want to replay those games so badly
[1:39:04] <Sloavon> the best Dragon Age was Mass Effect 2
[1:39:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> oh boy
[1:39:08] <Tucker0603> the greatest sin of DA:I is the fact that there's no proper romance with Scout Harding
[1:39:09] <%kiiiirsten> This quest was amazingly annoying
[1:39:11] <%joylent_blue> WOW get that Cullen hate outta this chat
[1:39:12] <Hazlet95> nice tequila save

[1:53:28] <nofestu2> Pat's such a god hacker he hacked the game
[1:53:29] <Gruhunchously> What's this?
[1:53:42] <%lewdskeletor13> This quest always bugged out for me
[1:53:42] <%Chocolatevgz> I was trying to get Boone points. Eventually just murdered some Legion. I dunno if that helps but hey, killing Legion is never wrong ey
[1:53:45] <otterboxer> @kevinr220 I know a couple of those guys, the shifts are absolute killer.
[1:53:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> @nofestu2 "We're in"

[2:28:08] <%PipIV> we gotta duck the poison out apatSmug
[2:28:09] <SovPho> should fast travel to check js

[2:28:13] <%Chocolatevgz> but where is Boone
[2:28:15] <JJMR322> hes fine... ally dead
[2:28:17] <%OwlLightningMage> Time to reload LUL
[2:28:17] <raminnoodle420> is Boone under the ground?
[2:28:19] <%Chocolatevgz> Cause here he's not
[2:28:20] <thelaxinator> He's not playing Hardcore so companions are immortal
[2:28:21] <dekkitout> time for some good old fashioned console commands
[2:28:24] <JanusII> Just find the nearest door really.
[2:28:24] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat go to searchlight first to get the quest for the points
[2:28:24] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @zaworldo he's sleeping
[2:28:26] <%brave_sj> No, that's Searchlight
[2:28:26] <%Kahnicus> @AngriestPat check boone's page on the wiki, there are certain circumstances for the history points
[2:28:26] <Gruhunchously> Everyone is underground.
[2:28:26] <%ArcanumMBD> did boone fall into the dev room amd get banned?
[2:28:27] <%kiiiirsten> Everyone asks "Where's Boone" but no one ever asks "How's Boone"
[2:28:28] <DSD24> Did Pat save the Ghouls with the rocket btw?
[2:28:28] <Hippineapple228> I think so
[2:28:28] <+Skatedeandre> Like paige always says “they’re just tired”
[2:28:29] <%Niney_Who> Pat look for a BODY
[2:28:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> grr
[2:28:30] <%PaladinDupre> He's dead Jim
[2:28:34] <DrDomVonDoom> Their hacking ban those doggos
[2:28:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> @JJMR322 That's what he gets for leaving me hanging on the dead wife story
[2:28:36] <FracturedImage> Sniper's Nest is near Cottonwood
[2:28:37] <KoyaMusa> ugghhh some blue mage rng i swear
[2:28:38] <slothslayer828> searchlight btw
[2:28:39] <+StealthOblivion> I think you should enter and exit the cave to fix your bugged enemies
[2:28:39] <a_a_ronin> Underground fighting dirt pups for eternity
[2:28:40] <RiverBirch> Pat
[2:28:40] <%salty_syd913> i think hes dead
[2:28:40] <%king_wragles> Aren't we all underground in a sense?
[2:28:42] <RiverBirch> You're Underground
[2:28:43] <Alpha820> Companions do die, I've killed them while playing before.
[2:28:43] <Notalza> that's not the cove
[2:28:43] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat You really should go check if boone is Dead so you know to reload
[2:28:44] <%manwithboxonhead> Boone...bought a farm...
[2:28:44] <raminnoodle420> Boone has mastered the No Clip
[2:28:48] <a_mad_dragon> better console-command him back
[2:28:49] <+Superkbrown95> !uptime
[2:28:49] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 28m.
[2:28:50] <mr_ESB> Is this better than 4?
[2:28:53] <KeystoneA1> Use a console command to kill the bugged Nighstalker
[2:28:54] <Mnightshyamallama> i think if you go and do the quest at the nrc outpost you will probably get enough points for him
[2:28:54] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat you killed him with the explosive round ya big dumb
[2:28:56] <%Totally_not_toby> They're just tired sipsipSipsipblind
[2:28:57] <%pimpinahz> apatHoldon apatHoldon
[2:28:57] <ManicMutt15> Is there a link to the modlist anywhere?
[2:28:59] <Sinister_Aglet> Remember, Pat won't play VTMB because he's afraid of bugs
[2:29:00] <%ECRead> Boone is Nightcrawler
[2:29:00] <dekkitout> by far this is better
[2:29:00] <Gruhunchously> @mr_ESB No doubt
[2:29:01] <%Chocolatevgz> NV is better than 3, so yes
[2:29:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> This is good Boone...isn't it?
[2:29:06] <zerocruz> New vegas baby
[2:29:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Boone isnt dead he just went to the farm.
[2:29:08] <lotharrio> If you killed the Legion slavers that grabbed the Powdergangers, that's an early point...
[2:29:08] <%OwlLightningMage> Every mainline game is better than 4 LUL
[2:29:09] <%Wrashis> new vegas is much better than 4 ye
[2:29:09] <+PolarBearPat> +
[2:29:11] <+InugamiTheHound> new vegas and 3 are better than FO4. FO4 is still pretty good FYI
[2:29:11] <%bread_assassin> Killing Caeser gets you two. @AngriestPat
[2:29:12] <%Chocolatevgz> BibleThump
[2:29:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> Boone's making bad wine on a farm in heaven now.
[2:29:17] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat I'm like 75% sure I saw boone's head explode due to your explosive .50 Cal
[2:29:19] <%DirtyGaijin> oh lord boone be dead
[2:29:20] <Qits> You can kill the companions if you shoot them when they're injured but enemies cant. Boom wont get up though cause Pat's still in combat.
[2:29:21] <KeystoneA1> @Sinister_Aglet Even though the community patch totally fixes all of them
[2:29:24] <%PaladinDupre> You killed Boone
[2:29:24] <Gorgen> Boone is dead.
[2:29:26] <%brave_sj> Boone can't die, this isn't hardcore
[2:29:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> @OwlLightningMage Even the famous Fallout 76?
[2:29:29] <%Chocolatevgz> where's his corpse then
[2:29:29] <%PaladinDupre> RIP
[2:29:32] <alrobot2014> @Niney_Who he can't kill boone
[2:29:34] <Mr_Strut> Just swim idiot
[2:29:35] <%salty_syd913> Boone RIP
[2:29:38] <%PaladinDupre> ED-E dead too
[2:29:40] <alrobot2014> @Niney_Who only on hardcore
[2:29:40] <excelsenor> have i missed anything?
[2:29:44] <Gruhunchously> No, you have to discover Cottonwood Cove first, then talk to the soldier and Camp Searchlight to trigger the quest.
[2:29:44] <AlasterAngelo> it's actually See-Zar
[2:29:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wooa
[2:29:47] <%DirtyGaijin> Im sure they will be fine
[2:29:52] <%DirtyGaijin> CHUNK
[2:29:52] <jobbedbone> can NPCs get stuck outside the map though? thats even worse
[2:29:52] <%PaladinDupre> they're really dead pat
[2:29:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> The game is breaking as you play
[2:29:52] <KangarooCyborg> Not a bug, it's a feature
[2:29:54] <%Chocolatevgz> it's scissor
[2:29:54] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat Did you do the booted quest?
[2:29:57] <%OwlLightningMage> @Th3SmartAlec 76 isn't real. It's a joke LUL
[2:30:00] <excelsenor> Also has Pat gotten Cass yet
[2:30:01] <%SpamKingRathalos> Boone is doomed
[2:30:03] <TheMirai> This is like the superscorpion DRM in Serious Sam 3
[2:30:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> apatBig broken.
[2:30:05] <Goldenwolf98> Its Key Zor
[2:30:07] <+Skatedeandre> The game says kaizar
[2:30:11] <%PipIV> push through the crash
[2:30:11] <%Chocolatevgz> 76 is one of those games I'd like to try out but not buy
[2:30:12] <%PaladinDupre> So dead
[2:30:13] <dukenux> 76 is a social experiment, justlike Vault 11 Kappa
[2:30:15] <%DirtyGaijin> @excelsenor nah he skipped her
[2:30:15] <Gruhunchously> Boone is still unconscious.
[2:30:22] <dekkitout> wait, fo76 is real- i thought that was some fever dream i had?
[2:30:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> Pat, there are many stages of denial when coping with the death of a friend. You can talk to us about Boone
[2:30:23] <%Keeble24> bOONE is apatBig dead
[2:30:23] <%Chocolatevgz> So maybe in a few years when private servers come out and fix all the bugs
[2:30:24] <%Chocolatevgz> Kappa
[2:30:27] <KangarooCyborg> NV frame stutters are just a side effect of getting shot in the head
[2:30:31] <%Shady_Zaku> For fuck sake NotLikeThis
[2:30:34] <%narusao> boone lives on in our hearts
[2:30:35] <alrobot2014> this is a different kind of ambush
[2:30:35] <%pimpinahz> I laugh if he zones in and Boone and EDE doesnt load = dead
[2:30:36] <%Kahnicus> a social experiment to see how much more money people will spend after not getting what they paid for
[2:30:38] <dukenux> Bandits will attack you here
[2:30:38] <Notalza> trap
[2:30:39] <jobbedbone> rest for an hour maybe boone will show up?
[2:30:39] <%SpamKingRathalos> t r a p

[2:34:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> I need to kill them ALL
[2:34:53] <Gruhunchously> Basically, the family that lived here got hit by the dirty bomb residue from searchlight. The parents turned into ghouls and the child was forced to kill them. The child then became paranoid about the animals becoming ghouls as well, so she burned the whole place down and was killed in the process.

[2:35:28] <+TheMattman1313> @codussalpha I mean at the current time: like imagining giving birth to something with TWO heads
[2:35:32] <%connos_livereview> LUL
[2:35:34] <dukenux> depending where you are
[2:35:34] <%Chocolatevgz> paper is made of black box material innit
[2:35:34] <%OwlLightningMage> This reminds me of Andale
[2:35:35] <%PipIV> Made in the USA
[2:35:37] <%TheSpiritof2277> Paper is the next stage of evolution
[2:35:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> @PaladinDupre *Strong paper
[2:35:39] <%DirtyGaijin> @codussalpha i think you mean current farm :D
[2:35:41] <natebud> Go ahead just try to eat him now pat, you can't
[2:35:41] <Huntercd> So that person went mad?
[2:35:41] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat get readhy for green filter
[2:35:42] <%theonceandfuturefish> Hey I was finding fully readable notes in 4 from prewar, Fallout Universe has super paper
[2:35:42] <jobbedbone> how can the paper be real if the lore isn't real?
[2:35:43] <thelonechris> Five Star: built strong to last long
[2:35:45] <asurite_warrior> Fallout nv just crashed on me again.
[2:35:49] <Ugato> The paper being there tells you there’s some sort of lore asshole going around trying to explain random skeletons
[2:35:50] <BeefyQueefer> bone salad yum yum
[2:35:52] <asurite_warrior> Had to restart computer
[2:35:53] <dukenux> Asbestos Paper Newest product from Vault-Tec
[2:35:55] <%OwlLightningMage> PogChamp
[2:35:55] <%PaladinDupre> @Th3SmartAlec oh no Pat's condition is contagious
[2:35:57] <+Flambage> The paper is now ghoul paper
[2:36:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> And?
[2:36:01] <Ugato> And just making shit up
[2:36:05] <dekkitout> dirty bomb PogChamp
[2:36:07] <$codussalpha> @TheMattman1313 ? it's not that odd. conjoined twins are a thing
[2:36:08] <DSD24> I remember this place having Knock Knock the unique axe
[2:36:09] <thelaxinator> I always assume all wastelandy creatures just lay eggs like Nightstalkers do
[2:36:12] <raminnoodle420> T he I n ci de nt
[2:36:16] <Futurecity10> Bone marrow is good eats
[2:36:17] <thelaxinator> Yum, Beef eggs.
[2:36:18] <%OwlLightningMage> No Holy Hand Grenade though
[2:36:20] <%kiiiirsten> Time to put your space boots on
[2:36:23] <Jaysky> Wuh happun??
[2:36:24] <%Shady_Zaku> What Happuuun
[2:36:24] <jobbedbone> I don't like the way hes looking at me
[2:36:28] <Gruhunchously> You can't get An Eye for an Eye unless you've discovered Cottonwood Cove. You have to tell them about the Legion forces there.
[2:36:28] <%Chocolatevgz> As much as I get why we can't have ghoul PCs because they use radiation to gatekeep, I really would like to play a ghoul
[2:36:28] <%OwlLightningMage> They got one of them Joker bombs
[2:36:29] <natebud> Something wrong with the eyes in this mod
[2:36:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> The Incident? You mean the Alien Invasion in New York we refuse to acknowledge?
[2:36:32] <dukenux> wow, Legion has dirty bombs, huh
[2:36:38] <%Chocolatevgz> At least this game let me not be a vault dweller for once
[2:36:40] <%DirtyGaijin> everyone has such intense stares
[2:36:49] <%Chocolatevgz> (for twice, if you count the old games)
[2:36:49] <$codussalpha> @dukenux "radiation bomb" they drove a truck full of nuclear barrels in and just opened them up
[2:36:53] <dekkitout> first sergeant aster is really feeling the disaster
[2:36:56] <slothslayer828> bug eyed
[2:37:02] <%oKentucky> NOT THE MUTANTS
[2:37:03] <%Chocolatevgz> Why's his skin made of bronze
[2:37:05] <%kiiiirsten> @Chocolatevgz I love that, you're literally just Some Douche out here in the wastes
[2:37:08] <thelonechris> So is the rest of the world
[2:37:11] <dukenux> not that surprising, obtaining radiation material in this world sounds like nothing difficult
[2:37:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> Raiden can take care of those
[2:37:14] <%DirtyGaijin> he is a golden god
[2:37:18] <nofestu2> scorps
[2:37:24] <%manwithboxonhead> That’s why we are staying here.
[2:37:31] <Mnightshyamallama> as long as there aren't any cazadors or whatever they are called
[2:37:34] <+fantom_flasch> Wouldn't ghouls created by new radiation exposure not be feral generally?
[2:37:35] <lotharrio> Has anyone ever managed to get Raul's quest? It feels impossible to trigger.
[2:37:36] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat discover Cottonwood, then come back
[2:37:42] <imtransphobic> Face retexture mod OMEGALUL
[2:37:43] <%kiiiirsten> He wants you to stay out, why would he tell you to go in?
[2:37:45] <Gorgen> Sir
[2:37:46] <TranquilTurnip> Don't you already have this quest?
[2:37:47] <dmtjinni> NO
[2:37:47] <%OwlLightningMage> I forget how to get this quest.
[2:37:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> Sir? I guess you're in charge now
[2:37:49] <lotharrio> Just start grabbing dog tags.
[2:37:50] <%AncelDeLambert> nope, guy IN the town gives the quest
[2:37:52] <%Chocolatevgz> is Raul the cool mechanic guy
[2:37:55] <dukenux> Did you pick the Ranger Station visit quest?
[2:37:56] <%OwlLightningMage> I think you have to talk to one in town
[2:37:57] <KeystoneA1> It's "We all go" or something like that
[2:37:58] <Reckeler> discover cotton wood cove, then do the dogtags
[2:37:59] <$codussalpha> @lotharrio not that hard. just gotta follow the triggers for it
[2:37:59] <%Kahnicus> his dialogue tree is a bitch
[2:38:02] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Patroling the Mohave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter
[2:38:02] <dukenux> Yeah, Raoul the Ghoul
[2:38:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> sir sir sir please dont do that sir sir
[2:38:04] <thelonechris> Go check out that heavily irradiated town
[2:38:06] <%kiiiirsten> Dip your toes in the radiation pool
[2:38:07] <Gruhunchously> You have to have Cottenwood Cove first.
[2:38:08] <%theonceandfuturefish> Yup Raul is Danny Trejo ghoul and best companion
[2:38:12] <%king_wragles> "well, since you already went in once how about...."
[2:38:13] <%Chocolatevgz> Love that guy
[2:38:14] <natebud> Time to put on your spacesuit boi
[2:38:15] <$Plutt_bug> Discover cotton with ... never mind
[2:38:16] <+zaworldo> rrrrraaauuuullllllll
[2:38:21] <%Chocolatevgz> I haven't played this in years though, so I'm no help lol
[2:38:22] <dekkitout> green filter time
[2:38:24] <%FrostMass22> This game is so cool but so broken that I feel like it's pointless to try and enjoy it
[2:38:25] <puhff> @chocolatevgz yes
[2:38:26] <%OwlLightningMage> Space suit time PogChamp
[2:38:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> this place is pretty RAD

[2:38:41] <$codussalpha> meanwhile boon's just getting ALL THE CANCER
[2:38:42] <+TheMattman1313> This isn't Cottonwood Cove

[2:38:52] <%OwlLightningMage> Night time suit LUL
[2:38:53] <TheHeroAppears> it feels bad that pat can't get the holy hand grenade

[2:39:27] <Gruhunchously> You're doing great.
[2:39:30] <alrobot2014> i fucking hate necropolis
[2:39:30] <%Chocolatevgz> Someone tell Paige, Pat's killing skeletons
[2:39:39] <Coystick> Go ED-E save the world with lasers
[2:39:40] <jobbedbone> whats that noise
[2:39:40] <%justicevi4> Why isnt Pat wearing the helmet NotLikeThis
[2:39:41] <$codussalpha> too fleshy for skeletons
[2:39:43] <TheEnablerr> skeleton GENOCIDE
[2:39:43] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat is killing skeletons in his night time suit
[2:39:44] <dekkitout> i just assume going ghoul is like going undead/hallow in dark souls
[2:39:45] <%DirtyGaijin> what is that noise
[2:39:47] <%kiiiirsten> @codussalpha Some effect of the radiation bomb instaghouled them
[2:39:48] <+SWFanatic> theres a skeleton inside everyone trying to get out
[2:39:49] <42nfl19> They aint skelly bois cause they got skin
[2:39:52] <Kataguro> That sounds is horrific
[2:39:55] <%AbnormalVoid> Rad Away Right Away
[2:40:00] <+zaworldo> If you choose to play as a ghoul with this mad, do rads heal you? @AngriestPat
[2:40:11] <TheEnablerr> You brush your skeleton every morning
[2:40:13] <BeefyQueefer> That laser is strong enough to turn a person entirely, skeleton included, to ash but it can't melt dogtags
[2:40:14] <$codussalpha> @kiiiirsten i know that, i said went feral awefully quick. not ghoulified
[2:40:17] <imtransphobic> MAGA KKona
[2:40:19] <Mr_Strut> GOTTA CHEAT
[2:40:25] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat fun fact, if you have wild wasteland activated, the Holy Hand Grenades of Antioch can be found here
[2:40:28] <%kiiiirsten> @codussalpha Gotcha, my mistake!
[2:40:38] <%hidef_sarge> it goes it goes it goes GUILLOTINE
[2:40:38] <Gruhunchously> Yay! You turned on some turrets
[2:40:40] <%DirtyGaijin> @TheEnabler lewd
[2:40:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> It's trying its best, okay?
[2:40:43] <Mnightshyamallama> but you don't get xp from the turret kills
[2:40:43] <Ugato> It’s doing the best it can
[2:40:57] <dukenux> Doesn't radiation make them autoregen?
[2:40:58] <asurite_warrior> This area was built to be a early game area
[2:40:58] <%LogothX> the skulls parasite unit?
[2:40:59] <+zaworldo> If you choose to play as a ghoul with this mad, do rads heal you? @AngriestPat
[2:41:00] <%OwlLightningMage> Turret chan is excited
[2:41:02] <thelonechris> Just making sure they're dead
[2:41:02] <FackinCrazy> Why do they have skull heads ?
[2:41:03] <TranquilTurnip> Its a BB gun turret
[2:41:04] <%Hazard_Kujacker> @AngriestPat They're bitches, but it just happens that they regenerate life
[2:41:04] <TheEnablerr> @DirtyGaijin very
[2:41:05] <ScreamingMeat> Look at the turret freaking its shit
[2:41:06] <PSI_Guy95> ghoul troopers?
[2:41:07] <Reckeler> the health regen is what made them tough
[2:41:09] <%PenmanLupine> Give boone the trooper armor
[2:41:11] <%Kahnicus> yeah, i'm having fun ravaging nelson with Boone ED-E and Mercy.
[2:41:12] <FracturedImage> repair their armor and give to boone
[2:41:25] <Notalza> EAST PAT
[2:41:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> woaw
[2:41:26] <Gruhunchously> Heroes never die
[2:41:31] <%Chocolatevgz> EDGE
[2:41:33] <raminnoodle420> He Glow
[2:41:36] <Mr_Strut> Radiation lasts a LONG time
[2:41:38] <dukenux> Such is life in the Zone
[2:41:39] <Mnightshyamallama> it is almost like a bomb went off
[2:41:39] <AlasterAngelo> glow in the dark
[2:41:40] <%PenmanLupine> depends if the mod isn't just cosmetic, like it gives you stats or something
[2:41:43] <%PipIV> goodbye horses
[2:41:44] <%thebonebard> man i want a fallout that lets you play as a ghoul so much
[2:41:45] <%kiiiirsten> That Rad-X didn't do him much good
[2:41:54] <%kiiiirsten> the airport duh
[2:41:54] <Gruhunchously> The ghoul had Rad-X on him. There's some irony.
[2:41:55] <alrobot2014> the airport
[2:41:55] <harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> @angriestpat the reason they seem tough is because you are using a weapon designed for stealth attacks as a main run and gun weapon
[2:41:57] <$codussalpha> that ghoul drank a glowstick
[2:41:58] <The_Blumper> Airport
[2:41:58] <CrabSlacks> I don't know if I would trust Rad-X from that guy
[2:41:58] <%Chocolatevgz> So 76 doesn't allow ghoul PCs, right?
[2:42:02] <alrobot2014> Searchlight Airport
[2:42:02] <Reckeler> searchlight airport
[2:42:03] <dukenux> it's an airport
[2:42:07] <HeroPietro> Empty airport
[2:42:09] <%TheSpiritof2277> there's apatBig nothing here
[2:42:11] <person181> brake the wall down
[2:42:11] <lotharrio> The game is so dense, they are still programming locations for it.
[2:42:11] <raminnoodle420> Jump the fence pat
[2:42:13] <Gruhunchously> This is the edge of the world!
[2:42:14] <%DirtyGaijin> Imagine fallout 4 but instead of cryo you are just a ghoul
[2:42:18] <evbites> remember in fo 4 with that glowing sea bullshit
[2:42:18] <KeystoneA1> There are 2 chests with like 300 caps in them
[2:42:20] <TheEnablerr> searchlight airport AKA usless waste of space
[2:42:21] <%Chocolatevgz> That's the game I wanted lol
[2:42:22] <%PenmanLupine> @Chocolatevgz No, but that wouldn't make sense if it did since th only PC's are Vault 76 residents
[2:42:24] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Chocolatevgz there aren't any NPCs, just robots and ghouls
[2:42:25] <dukenux> Nog, Big Nothing is DLC Kappa
[2:42:26] <thelaxinator> 76 doesn't even have ghouls yet, just "scorched"
[2:42:28] <The_Blumper> Its a port where flying machines land
[2:42:29] <%Chocolatevgz> Oh right, 76 is vault boys
[2:42:31] <imtransphobic> TheIlluminati
[2:42:31] <angeredkaazoo> Cove = water, go to the river Pat
[2:42:32] <%bigirontarkus> Rad
[2:42:33] <%Chocolatevgz> booo
[2:42:33] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat you can get on the airfield but its lots of nothing
[2:42:34] <+Aztec50> that zooooooom though
[2:42:35] <CrabSlacks> that airport has nothing neat
[2:42:36] <+TheMattman1313> Go further to the North to get into the airfield
[2:42:37] <mikesw0315> I’ve been running the same mods as pat, but the other day it looked like some of them auto updated and now my main menu is blank and none of the mods seem to be working. Anyone else have this happen?
[2:42:37] <RetributionP> you are so bad pat just give boon the anti matirial rifle
[2:42:38] <AlasterAngelo> that's rad
[2:42:38] <%thebonebard> @Chocolatevgz i think you can turn into a ghoul but i could be wrong and you can probably revert
[2:42:42] <guppyman461> cottonwood cove is north where the road ends i believe
[2:42:43] <%afronooch> theres ferals in 76
[2:42:45] <%DirtyGaijin> legion camp time
[2:42:48] <%PipIV> *Big MT
[2:42:49] <Gruhunchously> Have you ever been to the nuclear waste dump? That a collection of the toughest ghouls in the game.
[2:42:52] <$codussalpha> @AngriestPat *uses gun designed for sneaks as run and gun weapon, does minimal damage* wow you guys are tough
[2:42:53] <%Fidel_Castbro> Kill them all Boone
[2:42:55] <%bigirontarkus> nice
[2:42:56] <42nfl19> Does pat not have to care about Rad management for his companions?
[2:42:57] <thelonechris> PogChamp
[2:43:01] <%Chocolatevgz> They could patch in playing something else eventually, if the gamew eren't on the verge of death
[2:43:02] <Huntercd> So is the entire world fucked or just America?
[2:43:05] <st_jimmy456> shamNice
[2:43:08] <raminnoodle420> He comin
[2:43:09] <%afronooch> cant really tell the difference between scorched, but theyre there
[2:43:10] <jobbedbone> bork buster award
[2:43:10] <%Hilleltaco> Oh lawd he comin
[2:43:12] <+Aztec50> oh LAWD he comin
[2:43:13] <WaterDragon68> I love the geckos
[2:43:15] <Gruhunchously> Fire Geckos. These things were the worst in Fallout 2.
[2:43:16] <%manwithboxonhead> The World
[2:43:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> niceu niceu, verrrry niceu, Kaisar-chan!
[2:43:17] <%PipIV> assume it's the entire world
[2:43:18] <Mr_Strut> Geometry
[2:43:18] <%DirtyGaijin> @Huntercd the world
[2:43:18] <%Chocolatevgz> Not sure we've ever seen other regions, but it's safe to assume everything is fucked
[2:43:18] <alrobot2014> @Huntercd everything
[2:43:18] <%PenmanLupine> @thebonebard you can't turn into a ghoul. You can only get perks that make you resistant to Radiation/make it heal you. you won't look like a ghoul
[2:43:19] <TheEnablerr> Companions don't suffer from rads
[2:43:22] <dekkitout> @Huntercd its generally assumed that the world is fucked
[2:43:23] <%theonceandfuturefish> Poor delayed reaction gecko...
[2:43:27] <%ThatGuyfromMars> wow that was a headshot
[2:43:35] <%Hazard_Kujacker> @Gruhunchously tougher than the Marked Men in The Courier's Mile or Dry Wells/Long 15?
[2:43:38] <thelaxinator> Being a ghoul seems like an alright deal except for the whole inevitable dementia thing
[2:43:50] <%Chocolatevgz> well and all your skin melting off but
[2:43:50] <%yet_another_brony> theyre creepy when they spot you through the lens
[2:43:51] <%thebonebard> @Huntercd america i think america got the least fucked because they got vaults
[2:43:54] <polecorleone> Bazinga
[2:43:56] <alrobot2014> @Huntercd you can see the world from space in fallout 3 mothership zeta and the whole world is basically clouded in radiation
[2:43:57] <Gruhunchously> @Hazard_Kujacker Toughest ghouls in the [base] game.
[2:44:01] <natebud> and the melted face @thelaxinator
[2:44:04] <+Mottyrob> Do you think Cotton Eye Joe came from Cottonwood Cove?
[2:44:05] <$codussalpha> @thelaxinator i dont think going feral is guaranteed
[2:44:06] <dekkitout> prior to the bombs, europe had an issue with a fossil fuel crisis and went to shit. meanwhile us and china had a nuclear powered dick measuring contest
[2:44:07] <puhff> Yeah can anyone explain why bethesda went w this whole Scorched thing instead of just ghouls?
[2:44:12] <raminnoodle420> ah yes, the vaults where nothing bad happens
[2:44:15] <dukenux> The Vaults sheltered like, a fraction of percent of America's population
[2:44:18] <dukenux> most got fried
[2:44:24] <thelaxinator> Actually here's a good question: Do ghouls go insane due to brain-rot or just the ennui of everlasting life?
[2:44:24] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I dunno if that dementia is inevitable @thelaxinator there's an NPC in 4 that was alive when the bombs dropped and that was 210 years
[2:44:32] <$codussalpha> @dekkitout europe had already fallouted itself with the middle east too
[2:44:35] <swesterly> what is your canon special Pat
[2:44:42] <Gruhunchously> What's this? A truck full of radioactive barrels?
[2:44:43] <%OwlLightningMage> Anor londo PogChamp
[2:44:47] <Gruhunchously> Hanging over a cliff?
[2:44:49] <%Chocolatevgz> IS THIS ANOR LONDO?

[2:44:51] <dekkitout> did it now, well, there it is
[2:44:53] <raminnoodle420> LUL
[2:44:57] <%thebonebard> @raminnoodle420 i mean its either that or having your land get super fucked
[2:44:58] <daisymaisy02> Kick the radioactive barrels onto em
[2:44:58] <%Jpdodds> @thelaxinator Little of columnA a little of Xolumn /B

[2:44:59] <Gruhunchously> What?
[2:44:59] <jobbedbone> does fallout have norad?

[3:00:34] <%DirtyGaijin> He looks irradiated himself
[3:00:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer200 Clearly you're losing karma for stealing from the Legion, because you're going easy on them. At minimum, the morally neutral choice is to desecrate all their corpses.
[3:00:44] <baronvonphazon> "i shot them all then irradiated their corpses for fun"
[3:00:46] <maccus> All this green... what is this, Fallout 3?

[3:01:42] <%OwlLightningMage> I'm excited for work for scumbag corporations in Outer Worlds LUL
[3:01:44] <%joylent_blue> if you talk to him before setting the barrels free and you tell him you just shot everyone he's like "what the FUCK you're a badass"
[3:01:48] <%ShovelJustice21> why does boone look sick?
[3:01:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> War never changes, etc

[3:08:11] <lotharrio> Hmmm... not this basement.
[3:08:11] <DrDomVonDoom> Big boy
[3:08:11] <InfraRedRidingHood_> Yeah, the glowing ghoul option in fallout character overhaul is busted af.
[3:08:18] <%TheSpiritof2277> Wrong church
[3:08:24] <slothslayer828> i thought it was a deathclaw
[3:08:25] <%Kahnicus> or maybe east church is the holy hand grenades, at any rate, talk to logan in the church basement with the scavengers
[3:08:26] <Gruhunchously> Mini nukes? Yes please
[3:08:28] <alrobot2014> those mininukes are where the had grenades are iirc

[3:08:53] <dukenux> WW turns them in HHGs iirc
[3:08:53] <$codussalpha> @AngriestPat radiation penetrates most not lead lined indoor areas yes. that's why chernobyl's still so fucked, the indoor areas are SUPER radioactive

[3:09:06] <Gruhunchously> Radiation doesn't really look like anything
[3:09:07] <dukenux> Really, Pat? Kappa
[3:09:07] <TheEnablerr> true
[3:09:07] <Count_Long> Fallout however, looks like dust, Pat
[3:09:07] <Croetec> really Kappa
[3:09:11] <%NWR_James> SCIENCE PAT
[3:09:11] <%lewdskeletor13> GIVE ME THe DRUGS OR ILL GO BANG
[3:09:12] <+Fenlig> Pat could be swimming in radiation right now
[3:09:12] <+Qsmash_> green = super radiated
[3:09:12] <%Kahnicus> those bigass geckos are terrifying
[3:09:14] <%NopeBadguy> FART GAS
[3:09:14] <KangarooCyborg> Fart radiation looks like that
[3:09:20] <IminyourBase> radiation smells and tastes like green
[3:09:21] <+InugamiTheHound> oh man jim sterling talked about how how bethesda fucked up fallout and skyrim over the years
[3:09:21] <+guntoad> No radiation looks like fart gas Pat Kappa
[3:09:22] <dukenux> HULLO, I'm Science-man
[3:09:22] <%faegbeard> radiation looks like cancer 20 years down the line
[3:09:26] <%DirtyGaijin> Feed me science pat!
[3:09:26] <%king_wragles> I think it's dangerous for a lot of reasons, but I also don't think you're wrong either
[3:09:28] <%Nobrev> nuclear fallout looks like dust though
[3:09:29] <thelonechris> Just like fart gas
[3:09:29] <Dakuu75> is that true?
[3:09:30] <Madbearv> fart clouds mutate pat
[3:09:30] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Radiation is I N V I S I B L E S S E d
[3:09:33] <NeoJoker316> Howdy Pat no1LOVE hiya chat lewLick
[3:09:35] <natebud> True
[3:09:36] <%AncelDeLambert> well, radioactive materials pile up, anyways
[3:09:37] <RetributionP> look at pictures of "Elephants foot."
[3:09:39] <%thebonebard> yea but this is super radiation
[3:09:40] <dekkitout> also tastes heavily like metal
[3:09:40] <$codussalpha> @AngriestPat metal also absorbs radiation, making it stick around longer
[3:09:40] <alrobot2014> i think if you pick up the wild wasteland perk in OWB you can come back for the hand grenades
[3:09:41] <%FrostMass22> How do you know your house isn't irradiated right now?
[3:09:41] <%TheShal> SUP NERD. Why aren't you in here grinding BLU with us?
[3:09:44] <PSI_Guy95> Radiation is really cool and fun
[3:09:44] <Count_Long> Man, remember that time we nuked Japan? Shits crazy.
[3:09:45] <%Kahnicus> getting irradiated IRL makes you shit a lot.
[3:09:45] <%AbnormalVoid> haw haw haw haw
[3:09:50] <DrDomVonDoom> Radiation is a hoarder
[3:09:50] <Bonk_Fever> as long as the fallout dust doesnt get inside the building tho isn't it safer to be inside?
[3:09:50] <%TheSpiritof2277> The fart-gas compound gives radiation a green tinge
[3:09:51] <valachi> You know what you also can't see? FUCKING REPTILE
[3:09:55] <%PipIV> @neojoker316 Howdy, pardner!
[3:09:56] <thelaxinator> Radiation: If you're aware of it you are already dead.
[3:09:57] <lotharrio> Yeah but this is dumb, 1950s science understanding of radiation. Which is also why you have giant insects.
[3:09:57] <SchroedingersFerret> Go back to that elephant's foot
[3:09:58] <BeefyQueefer> "radiation piles up and doesn't leave" sounds like a university student
[3:09:59] <C_S_N_G> That's the fallout
[3:10:00] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s Kryptonite radiation guys c’mon
[3:10:02] <Coystick> Glades they're fixing that in the New Metro
[3:10:02] <+Yokuho> I love when Pat talks out of his ass about sbjects he doesnt understand
[3:10:06] <DrDomVonDoom> Open a window let that radiation out
[3:10:09] <depressedpepega> Fallout, specially Bethesda Fallout radiation=magic to be fair
[3:10:13] <Count_Long> Yes. Also the updraft gets ashes and fallout caught in rain, which falls down as black rain, and if people drink it, bad times
[3:10:13] <dukenux> oh yeah, if you inhale that dust, you're fucked
[3:10:13] <CrabSlacks> but it gives you a new toe that you can kill the big bad boss with later
[3:10:15] <dekkitout> radiation: omae wa mou shindeiru
[3:10:16] <KangarooCyborg> Radiation = Poison. Pat science
[3:10:18] <%king_wragles> Hey @AngriestPat , why does your scope have a scope?
[3:10:21] <%Kahnicus> get the irradiated dog tags from the ghouls pat!

[3:10:31] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Pat, you'd dIEE!
[3:10:34] <%PipIV> the dust is FALLOUT
[3:10:34] <%kiiiirsten> @king_wragles so he can scope while he scopes
[3:10:34] <%AncelDeLambert> the wolves have taken the fuck over
[3:10:36] <%Kahnicus> wolves are making a population comeback in chernobyl due to lack of humans
[3:10:37] <%OwlLightningMage> Right basement
[3:10:38] <%Skeletorexplains> You should watch "Dark Tourism" pat. Its amazing. They go to all the radiation places & its terrifying.
[3:10:38] <$codussalpha> @AngriestPat Radiation also has a tendency to get absorbed by Metal, making it stick around longer than it would otherwise.
[3:10:38] <Coystick> S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Stream when?
[3:10:38] <%MelBrooksKA> Nuclear radiation is fucked up? YOU DON'T SAY!

[3:11:05] <%ECRead> Pat there's irradiated BEARS at Chernobyl
[3:11:07] <dukenux> Logan(2017)
[3:11:07] <RetributionP> pat have you seen pictures of of elephants foot
[3:11:10] <%FrostMass22> He's going to teach you crystal soul spear
[3:11:11] <thelaxinator> I watched a post-war infomercial about how to survive nuclear fallout. It basically said that once you feel better you are better... but in reality that's just the latency period...
[3:11:11] <Count_Long> Elephants foot is radical
[3:11:12] <%thebonebard> pat should go to centrailia instead, the real life silent hill place
[3:11:13] <$codussalpha> @KeystoneA1 did you know that back when they tested in nevada, the fallout would drift over to the strip?
[3:11:13] <dekkitout> no, not cool logan, paul, logan SeriousSloth
[3:11:15] <gustavozxd> what about metro 2033 with the radiation ghosts LUL actually the fact that heaven and hell got radiated as well is fucking sick
[3:11:18] <dukenux> noooooo
[3:11:20] <alrobot2014> @ECRead for real?!
[3:11:21] <%dave323dave> geez logan it's called please

[3:11:28] <%lewdskeletor13> Is he in the Lo-Gang?
[3:11:28] <slothslayer828> its rad
[3:11:32] <Count_Long> Heaven and Hell got blown apart not radiated in Metro
[3:11:33] <Count_Long> they are gone
[3:11:36] <%Kahnicus> would you believe logan's a fucking scumbag?
[3:11:37] <LustrousEudemon> radiation is rad
[3:11:39] <Teh_Un> Pat is helping :)
[3:11:41] <KeystoneA1> @codussalpha Makes me wish for a nuclear winter.
[3:11:42] <%OwlLightningMage> @gustavozxd That sounds metal as hell LUL
[3:11:43] <Gruhunchously> @gustavozxd I love that detail. About the afterlife itself being destroyed in the war.
[3:11:45] <OotsyMahDootsie> hacker god
[3:11:46] <Croetec> woops forgot my genocide Kappa
[3:11:47] <%TheSpiritof2277> How does he do it PogChamp
[3:11:48] <Dakuu75> radiation suits seems like something that'd be in high demand in the apocalypse, lead too.
[3:11:54] <%Jpdodds> @Count_Long Thats just Khan being a weird shaman and talking out of his ass
[3:11:59] <Count_Long> We nuked the world so hard we killed the afterlife
[3:11:59] <%king_wragles> Wait... did Pat mod the hacking?
[3:12:03] <Count_Long> thats true death
[3:12:12] <thelaxinator> Radiation suits are more about peace of mind than actual protection
[3:12:13] <Gruhunchously> Talk to Logan again.

[3:51:34] <%DirtyGaijin> Wasn't there a fix to the memory leak?
[3:51:35] <ToneBacas> gotta love software development
[3:51:35] <PSI_Guy95> hey what's Peepee doing right now
[3:51:36] <dukenux> memory leaks a bitch

[3:51:40] <NonAddictiveSlurm> get an expansion pak then Kappa
[3:51:40] <FstSergeant8595> everytime i play this game on PC it crashes after 30 minutes.
[3:51:40] <Coystick> It just dies
[3:51:44] <malkuthsoldier> Clearing the Cache might help. There's a mod for that.
[3:51:44] <Shastafield> NotLikeThis omg he broke it again
[3:51:46] <%TheSpiritof2277> The memory leak is a staple of that gamebryo quality™
[3:51:49] <Gruhunchously> Alas, all the best games are so buggy.
[3:51:53] <FackinCrazy> @alrobot2014 huh i figured at the very least the pc could over power the leak but i guess not
[3:51:55] <alrobot2014> literally had to restart my game 3 times in the deep roads
[3:51:55] <SovPho> at least it's not dragon age inquisition which runs at default ass
[3:51:59] <%mostundesired> Coincidentally, I'm playing Dragon Age Origins right now.
[3:52:06] <%InfinitumImmortalis> after all these years, they've still never managed to fix the memory leaks eh?
[3:52:08] <+justarthur0> i remember in fallout 3 when i discovered all the places on the map, the game immediately just shit the bed and never got better
[3:52:10] <%lewdskeletor13> Show us the PEPIS you coward
[3:52:16] <alrobot2014> i love origins but fuck that memory leak
[3:52:23] <%Kahnicus> lol, my game just crashed, piece of shit
[3:52:23] <baronvonphazon> it should also be known that "Default Ass" is Dragon Age Origins highest quality option
[3:52:23] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @InfinitumImmortalis it's an engine issue, not a game issue
[3:52:26] <alrobot2014> 10 minute long load times
[3:52:28] <Gruhunchously> Coward
[3:52:28] <Bouldus> DO IT

[3:53:22] <%LogothX> apatHoldon
[3:53:22] <%lewdskeletor13> Paige wanted the PEPIS earlier
[3:53:23] <FstSergeant8595> There was a glitch when New Vegas launched that corrupted you file if you picked up the Astronaut Suit in the REPCON facility. lost about 5 hours because of that

[3:57:24] <baronvonphazon> which are good, which are bad
[3:57:25] <Idon__> Life is just a temporary buff

[4:05:56] <%Chatterbox1991> mrdestructoid100 I couldn\t help but notice back in 2009ish that, for some reason, Dean Martin had a resurgence in video games Fall out: New Vegas, The Godfather part 2 (shockingly decent game) and Mafia 2 all featured the track "Ain't that a Kick in that head." kinda like how Imagine Dragons is in every movie trailer, game trailer or wrestling ppv promo nowadays, only more classy; btw if you were a Witcher what School would you be? Don't worry, It has nothing to do with art already being made

[4:06:13] <JDRK> Of course
[4:06:14] <orcstr16> IWANTTHAT
[4:06:15] <%OwlLightningMage> It still doesn't run great
[4:06:17] <%chzoseph> No items no faces fox only
[4:06:18] <DrSpatula> no faces, play hader
[4:06:18] <PumaOfDarkness> Fuclk yeah

[4:06:19] <TheEnablerr> that did. NOTHING.
[4:06:19] <%DirtyGaijin> I have no face but i must play
[4:06:19] <anar_bael> yeah
[4:06:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> if it runs okay
[4:06:23] <%StooEsq> it would be like every lame creepypasta ever
[4:06:24] <%lewdskeletor13> OH BOY
[4:06:27] <%Totally_not_toby> booooooo they have faces
[4:06:27] <alrobot2014> ITS MY BOY
[4:06:28] <%SiameseSneeze> I wouldn't listen to chat
[4:06:29] <SovPho> CPU priority and RAM consumption I'm telling you
[4:06:30] <%cureneckbeard> just play the game with suboptimal framerate like we've been doing
[4:06:30] <%joylent_blue> BOONE IS BACK
[4:06:30] <nobody12349> Download a no faces mod immediately Pat.
[4:06:31] <Gruhunchously> Well, he still has a face.
[4:06:31] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Play Kiwami
[4:06:31] <+zaworldo> oOH GOD
[4:06:32] <%OwlLightningMage> I think the engine is just dying before our eyes
[4:06:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> It kinda looks like it's running worse.
[4:06:36] <Mr_Strut> But at least the old faces are back
[4:06:36] <+zaworldo> BOONE'S FACE
[4:06:38] <%Tyonidus> You'd think these companies could make games that would at least run right on pc, but even with MODS this game barely works. I love it to death but it's such a pain sometimes.
[4:06:38] <%Kahnicus> @FrostMass22 not sure how potential it is, guess it depends on if it's being actively used or not
[4:06:38] <%CollinsOfBodom> Oh, Boone cleans up good
[4:06:39] <TheEnablerr> Potato Boone lives!
[4:06:39] <TalisKanju> That
[4:06:39] <SovPho> RAM consumption may not change between subsequent game restarts
[4:06:40] <Worldbrand> go download a mod that removes faces
[4:06:41] <Squidbit> @AngriestPat are you still running at 30fps through that thing you mentioned earlier?
[4:06:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> Like it seems more framey.
[4:06:43] <Gruhunchously> Boone's face is back.
[4:06:45] <%OwlLightningMage> It somehow looks worse LUL
[4:06:46] <%mimikyu92> look at your own face first pat
[4:06:48] <%TheSpiritof2277> I'm actually happy to see Oblivion Boone again
[4:06:49] <%TheUberknife> apatHoldon
[4:06:50] <TalisKanju> That's the Boone I remember
[4:06:51] <+Krawzwaka> good ol potato boon
[4:06:53] <randomp141> Moobot.

[4:06:56] <$codussalpha> it seems MOAR framey
[4:06:56] <%nmaten> oh boy
[4:06:57] <%Skrypto> lower cell buffer
[4:06:58] <daisymaisy02> Holy shit
[4:06:58] <alrobot2014> OH GOD NO
[4:06:58] <KangarooCyborg> I think the game is installing Fallout 76 repeatedly
[4:06:59] <Coystick> We gotta DISABLE. JUST ONE MORE MOD, Orthur
[4:07:00] <%Cavumentum> Fooled, BAMBOOZLED, it was a PLOY to GET BOONE'S FACE BACK

[4:07:32] <%TombstoneTTromboners> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[4:07:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Alternately, we can reverse our eye cancer for like an hour with YAKUZIIIIIIIES
[4:07:36] <carlmonte> Just turn off the game honestly
[4:07:38] <alrobot2014> 4K!!!!
[4:07:38] <%lewdskeletor13> THERES ALWAYS A GoD DAMN MOD
[4:07:39] <Izuurus> fallout: flatland
[4:07:42] <Mr_Strut> 1 Million Frames!
[4:07:44] <%Kahnicus> then the game would break cause it doesn't have the right files maybe?
[4:07:44] <%TheUberknife> Pog

[4:07:50] <LustrousEudemon> the goblins are in the mods
[4:07:52] <$codussalpha> @AngriestPat what's the difference between ojo bueno and poco bueno?
[4:07:56] <KRSG> Hell! There's a 8-bit graphics option. Run THAT Shit!!!!

[4:08:02] <PumaOfDarkness> Run it in 4:3 420p.
[4:08:03] <anar_bael> its time to play our favorite game, exterior collision
[4:08:04] <%manwithboxonhead> Are we in LA Noire?
[4:08:06] <%Kahnicus> wait, this is gog not steam
[4:08:08] <Gruhunchously> Well, you know. We tried.
[4:08:11] <%SaltyDongs> blanco god gohan

[4:08:16] <%InfinitumImmortalis> just mod the pain away
[4:08:17] <%lewdskeletor13> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[4:08:18] <%OwlLightningMage> Why in the actual hell is it running so bad? LUL
[4:08:23] <alrobot2014> if anything it looks like it started running worse
[4:08:27] <%DirtyGaijin> memory leaks maybe
[4:08:27] <Puppa_Warpig> oof
[4:08:28] <sdgundum990> does he have the sub machine gun from here?
[4:08:32] <corepool> is it worse now?
[4:08:33] <Gorgen> lower LOD
[4:08:34] <%DirtyGaijin> just shits itself over time
[4:08:37] <Maleicus> was that a scope on a scope
[4:08:38] <%nmaten> cause its new vegas
[4:08:40] <KRSG> @codussalpha I believe Ojo is higher graphics. If not, Poco is higher graphics. One is higher graphics.
[4:08:41] <%BrazenMask> no thats impossible
[4:08:42] <$Tuskor13> Oh sure blame us
[4:08:42] <startadevy> BEAST
[4:08:43] <%RedMaskBandit> Moobot bans me and eats my ass?!?! <gone sexual>
[4:08:44] <%chzoseph> Just stop streaming!
[4:08:44] <%cureneckbeard> we need 120fps
[4:08:45] <%OwlLightningMage> It wasn't this bad before
[4:08:46] <%Skrypto> @AngriestPat just lower shadow resolution by one, lower grass draw distance.
[4:08:46] <Graywolf_the_45th> Uninstall stream
[4:08:48] <startadevy> SUPER BOWL
[4:08:49] <%fallen92x> Get a better Processor then :P
[4:08:50] <%chzoseph> PRoblem Solved
[4:08:51] <%lewdskeletor13> New Vegas why you do this
[4:08:52] <TheEnablerr> or maybe gamebryo being a bitch
[4:08:54] <%cureneckbeard> it's fine don't worry about it
[4:08:55] <startadevy> StinkyCheese StinkyCheese StinkyCheese StinkyCheese StinkyCheese
[4:08:56] <SovPho> RAM consumption and CPU overload you're running mods which means someone probably left a leak in
[4:08:57] <$codussalpha> @AngriestPat now it looks AND runs garbo
[4:08:59] <%Luna_Ashford> Night vision
[4:08:59] <%TheNewJapanGuy> How wild is it that a broken New Vegas is STILL a better game than Fallout 76
[4:09:01] <+Blankets_and_Tea> we heard you like scops
[4:09:01] <LustrousEudemon> where is your framerate counter?
[4:09:02] <misterspotswood> its the IR diode
[4:09:02] <+xBacon26> Still runs better than the government
[4:09:02] <+Noxybaru> 2 scopes
[4:09:02] <%Kahnicus> for super zoom
[4:09:03] <%chzoseph> Scopes on scopes on
[4:09:05] <%Nobrev> infrared probably
[4:09:05] <%OwlLightningMage> Add more scopes to more scopes PogChamp
[4:09:06] <%mimikyu92> different magnifications
[4:09:06] <%RedMaskBandit> that's night vision boi
[4:09:06] <%Tyonidus> probably supposed to be a range finder or something on top
[4:09:08] <%axellogic> quick install 8k textures an enb and Vurts Flora Overhaul thatll fix your framerate! I'm not facestious
[4:09:08] <CrabSlacks> the game also just starts running slower the longer you play
[4:09:09] <HefestoForges> one for each eye
[4:09:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's so you can scope while you scope.
[4:09:10] <a_mad_dragon> SCOPECEPTION
[4:09:11] <randomp141> @OwlLightningMage Because the people who made it barely had six months to make it from the ground up using the Havok engine.
[4:09:12] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Get 2 computers and stream off of one, like the big boys do
[4:09:13] <%TombstoneTTromboners> it's for double sniping
[4:09:14] <+RushUnplugged> I bet there's an npc stuck somewhere and gamebryo throws a fit
[4:09:14] <sponsoredviewer910> download more ram
[4:09:14] <%AncelDeLambert> one's a scope, one's dot
[4:09:16] <%Sovspot> Vaati is actually using two processors in his PC. One is for streaming and the other is for video games.
[4:09:16] <Mnightshyamallama> @AngriestPat yo dawg I heard you like scopes
[4:09:16] <%PaladinDupre> YO DAWG
[4:09:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> Recursive scopes
[4:09:17] <Bouldus> fuck you Pat
[4:09:18] <baronvonphazon> The chat cries for Moobot's execution <2018 colourized>
[4:09:18] <sdgundum990> !time
[4:09:18] <%HaefenZebra> That's the infrared light to make the night vision work.
[4:09:20] <+Noxybaru> lmao 2scope
[4:09:22] <%Sovspot> I have no idea how that works
[4:09:23] <%MadSkulll> @TheNewJapanGuy cause it wasnt made by Bethesda LUL
[4:09:24] <$codussalpha> 1600 PAIRS OF EYES
[4:09:26] <%Kahnicus> two scopes for infinity shots
[4:09:26] <KangarooCyborg> How many tips can you take at once Pat?
[4:09:27] <%OwlLightningMage> @randomp141 I mean worse than usual LUL
[4:09:29] <KeystoneA1> Don't mention it asshole.
[4:09:29] <%lewdskeletor13> Is that sarcasm
[4:09:30] <Izuurus> nightvision
[4:09:30] <natebud> Old nightvision scopes had multiple scopes
[4:09:31] <%TheSpiritof2277> There's a mod that removes all needless clutter from the wasteland, do you have that
[4:09:34] <%cureneckbeard> hahah
[4:09:34] <AlasterAngelo> try deleting system 32
[4:09:34] <+graffitisamurai> Burn the stream down
[4:09:37] <%InfinitumImmortalis> the second scope is for the midget on your shoulder
[4:09:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I remember playing this on PS3 and you could only get so far into the game before the memory shit turned it into a literally unplayable slideshow
[4:09:42] <+justarthur0> run it in potato
[4:09:43] <Latch77> @AngriestPat did you try the performance tweaks from here ***
[4:09:44] <%Cavumentum> Who needs those newfangled, pesky "polygons?"
[4:09:46] <Idon__> The second scope is for the eyes on the inside. They're there to cure you of your beastly idiocy.
[4:09:47] <LustrousEudemon> I legit can't play games without a framerate counter in the top right
[4:09:48] <%FrostMass22> 3,200 pairs of esy
[4:09:50] <%Caidezes> Uninstall New Vegas.
[4:09:50] <%Hilleltaco> How does anyone play these games
[4:09:53] <%OwlLightningMage> It like something suddenly changed to make it run worse than it did at the start
[4:09:54] <%lewdskeletor13> This Music PogChamp
[4:09:56] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Ohh this piano music
[4:09:57] <KangarooCyborg> Run it in 0p
[4:09:59] <randomp141> @OwlLightningMage Oh, as pat said: It's probably because of the streaming.
[4:10:04] <%RedMaskBandit> someone says shitpost moar reeeee
[4:10:04] <%Luna_Ashford> That isn't how it works Pat
[4:10:05] <FracturedImage> LUL
[4:10:07] <%FrostMass22> @hilleltaco as you can see, not very easily
[4:10:07] <%Kahnicus> @AngriestPat wait till you play honest hearts and it just crashes every 30 seconds to five minutes at times
[4:10:08] <Puppa_Warpig> Here comes the big crash
[4:10:09] <+Noxybaru> a bold strategy
[4:10:12] <%Luna_Ashford> Just reboot your PC
[4:10:12] <+Grayhammatter> do it
[4:10:12] <person181> just like the goverment
[4:10:12] <%Nobrev> just play it as is
[4:10:13] <Gorgen> Cap it to 15 fps

[4:10:15] <%kiiiirsten> Everyone stop the Lion King just came on TV
[4:10:15] <%DirtyGaijin> there are mods to help with the memory leak in the game but not sure how good they are
[4:10:16] <corepool> this game's gonna explode
[4:10:16] <TheEnablerr> @AngriestPat download Ojo Bueno High instead of Ultra. Ultra is overkill
[4:10:16] <General_Terro> turn it down to 720p coward
[4:10:18] <alrobot2014> i remember the days of playing fallout 3 on the 360 and having broken steel's final quest crash every 10 minutes
[4:10:19] <%Jon64s> It’s time for revolution to arms to kill moobot
[4:10:19] <%lewdskeletor13> CANT WAKE UP
[4:10:19] <HefestoForges> the second scope is actually a clip-on buttplug for when you need it bad
[4:10:19] <%OwlLightningMage> @randomp141 It wasnt running this bad at the start of the stream though LUL
[4:10:20] <dekkitout> how bout we take new vegas, ND PUSH IT SOMEWHERE ELSE!

[4:10:48] <fruit_pie_the_magician> And this problem basically killed skyrim for like, two months on ps3, it shit itself so bad it would crash
[4:10:49] <%OwlLightningMage> I love this LUL

[4:11:15] <%Nobrev> @AngriestPat dick around with the settings so much that the game just turns into Yakuza Kiwami
[4:11:15] <TheEnablerr> also fun fact: there's a fire and smoke retexture that actually makes the smoke and fire chug less and look better
[4:11:15] <Idon__> Ahh Kos, or some say Kosm.
[4:11:16] <randomp141> @OwlLightningMage The only thing I can think of then is a memory leak from the huge amount of useless crap he has,

[4:11:21] <+RushUnplugged> does the game even support multi-threading
[4:11:22] <%Luna_Ashford> I win!

[4:16:28] <%lewdskeletor13> Did Pat finally shot his pants?
[4:16:30] <edfiggz> Is the stream over?
[4:16:32] <%TheSpiritof2277> how many pairs of pants you think Pat's lossed
[4:16:33] <%TheUberknife> >:)
[4:16:36] <TheEnablerr> For those who would like to liven up the wasteland a bit, I recommend using Better New Vegas. it expands some areas, adds some raider camps and makes the area around freeside look less empty
[4:16:36] <Lurantis_> All I’m saying is fallout 4 is a solid 6/10
[4:16:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> He said he was gonna walk around and shit. So I assume that's a thing and he might have beeded a mop.
[4:16:43] <%manwithboxonhead> Or this was an excuse to get a quicky in.
[4:16:45] <%lewdskeletor13> @edfiggz Nope

[4:19:03] <resident_hentai> i had a three hour smoke break and when i come back he leaves
[4:19:04] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat showed his pepis on stream and fled in terror
[4:19:06] <resident_hentai> what thje hell man
[4:19:07] <BaronVonProlix> The Vsync killed him
[4:19:11] <+xdoom_guyx> is this the part where we play with our dicks?
[4:19:13] <almostgotpitted> Pat will the band ever get back together
[4:19:13] <%nofestu2> apatHoldon
[4:19:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> This chill "we'll be Right Back" music is a little too chill for my liking. Play death metal instead.
[4:19:16] <+CptVolkow> Lets raid WoolieVS
[4:19:17] <%Kahnicus> weird that the new podcasts are on the old website, ol matt might be too nice for his own good...
[4:19:17] <%InfinitumImmortalis> 3 hour smoke break
[4:19:22] <%DirtyGaijin> I showed you my pepis, please respond
[4:19:22] <HefestoForges> he's writing a short story
[4:19:25] <echodrone81> did the castle super beast come out yet?
[4:19:32] <%lewdskeletor13> Yes
[4:19:33] <%TheSpiritof2277> Woolie's stream has a crayfish firing lasers and going berserk
[4:19:34] <%speaks2much> came hard
[4:19:37] <Coystick> Todd came for him on stream, to take him to the Big Skyrim in the Sky
[4:19:37] <+CptVolkow> podcast is out
[4:19:38] <%OwlLightningMage> @lewdskeletor13 I like the idea of him showing it and running away in terror of himself LUL
[4:19:39] <%lewdskeletor13> 2 episodes
[4:19:40] <%FrostMass22> @echodrone81 2 episodes out now
[4:19:41] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@majindusto) (warning)
[4:19:43] <+Nomicro4u> Woolies stream has lobsters
[4:19:50] <KangarooCyborg> If Pat were to shit his pants, how long would it take him to stop panicking long enough to end the stream?
[4:19:51] <echodrone81> crap need to download
[4:19:53] <%nofestu2> pat ded
[4:19:54] <BaronVonProlix> Assassinated by Todd
[4:19:58] <+xdoom_guyx> Pats is setting uo for fallout Skyrim edition
[4:20:00] <PumaOfDarkness> I love how in these games troubleshooting is basically a giant side quest.
[4:20:04] <%lewdskeletor13> @owllightningmage LUL he underestimated his own power
[4:20:06] <%OwlLightningMage> Woolie's stream needs more RPGs on terrible game engines
[4:20:07] <sosuke5> Super beast, Super beast, Live a Castle Super beast
[4:20:08] <HefestoForges> todd said "there can't be two cowards"
[4:20:16] <%DirtyGaijin> The real battle is the troubleshooting
[4:20:28] <%Kahnicus> @PumaOfDarkness in these games not throwing the controller through your monitor is a sidequest
[4:20:32] <HefestoForges> we all know todd would lose that
[4:20:42] <%nofestu2> pat got flushed down the toilet
[4:20:43] <+xdoom_guyx> but there can be one million skyrims tho cant wait when it gets released on my life support
[4:20:45] <%FrostMass22> Super beast super beast
