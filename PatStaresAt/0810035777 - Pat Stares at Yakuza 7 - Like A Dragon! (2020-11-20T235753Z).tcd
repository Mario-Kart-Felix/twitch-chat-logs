[0:02:41] <%Sausious> none because he spent it on every strongest upgrade

[0:06:23] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Easily over 40.
[0:06:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If you play Yakuza 7 with everyone as breakers it becomes a game about culturally confused old men trying to look cool.
[0:06:33] <%McSoliace> pat at this point I don't think anyone would believe you would do any less than 40 million+
[0:06:37] <%MonsterEnvy> Cheer500 Hey Pat just thought you know that it is apparently best if you wait for the start of Chapter 8 to finish the management storyline. Also that bartender is totally Kashiwagi JP voice is the same and the bar is called Survive.

[0:39:40] <%BoxNavy> no :)
[0:39:40] <theotrainwreck> church of universal truth is the worshipers of the god you have to kill in a jrpg
[0:39:41] <%savagesforblood> I've never played a yakuza game. am I still allowed to be here??

They got jobs at his warehouse where Mabuchi is doing a big counterfeit scheme. Saeko had the idea to get one of the fake bills, and hand it to Ichiban who will smuggle it out of the warehouse. Then Pat ignored that and became a CEO.

[0:52:49] <+BroderQuinho> IDK... in my family home I think it's alright
[0:52:49] <%sumrand0> CLOGGING other peoples toilets is very personal
[0:52:50] <+jiggy_snipe> is your parents' house your childhood home?
[0:52:50] <%Puhff> oh yeah
[0:52:51] <+skyheys> Holding your shit like that will actually fuck you yp

[0:53:03] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Pat probably shouldn't go to jail
[0:53:04] <%Not_Dutch_> Pat cheated on his toilet?
[0:53:05] <Blank9> as you poop
[0:53:06] <@commanderclaw> I can discern one family member from another
[0:53:07] <%shurtal> is pat a cat? and shame poops?
[0:53:08] <cardamomo88> WutFace
[0:53:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> If I ever poop in someones bathroom it means either I had NO choice or I am VERY comfortable with you
[0:53:10] <+michingmallecho> Eli’s right
[0:53:11] <rageofkyubii> Cheer500 The only radio edit I ever heard that I liked was Tenacious D’s “F**k Her Hard” because they used over-the-top cartoon sound effects to do it. Car crash, honk horn, etc. Never could find a version of it online though.
[0:53:12] <RyuuAoi> And what if you leave skid marks on the toilet?
[0:53:13] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> clench marks in the hand rail
[0:53:13] <%mike2hands> Baby blep

[0:53:27] <%Puhff> Or which way they place the TP..
[0:53:28] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> It seeps into all their soft furnishings

[0:53:38] <Profmcstevie> Something animalistic comes out when it comes to pooping in anothers land
[0:53:38] <%Kataguro> Call of Poothulu

[0:53:47] <+CookieCutter007> ????
[0:53:49] <%BoxNavy> ??????
[0:53:49] <%Monkeyweed21> WHY
[0:53:50] <+CannonHeroBrett> What?
[0:53:50] <%Mendin> The trick is to be the first person to poop in their toilet after they clean it. It becomes your toilet now.
[0:53:52] <bob900000> hold it in your hand
[0:53:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> You guys are fucking weird
[0:53:53] <%animaturgy> An ffXIV poop Echo with flashbacks

[0:53:56] <+skyheys> BASTARD
[0:53:56] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> hearing somebody you respect does social damage
[0:53:57] <%king_wragles> Remember when this was a video game stream? Kappa

[0:53:58] <%Stepherzzzzzz> Get a fecal transplant to fix the disaster pooping
[0:53:58] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> No one is ever truly safe on the toilet
[0:53:58] <melonsouda> I get the pooping in other toilets being wierd, but what about peeing? is it wierd to pee in enemy toilets?
[0:53:58] <BooitsDock> he hold the paper and drops it
[0:54:00] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That's fine.
[0:54:00] <%BoxNavy> does he still hold the roll?
[0:54:00] <+CapnClassix> Get a bidet, you SAVAGE
[0:54:02] <%Bailey__gaming> Pat likes to hug it
[0:54:02] <RyuuAoi> Lazy Pat
[0:54:02] <@commanderclaw> What if you drop it in the sink?
[0:54:02] <+bear_breaker20> picking it up leads to germs
[0:54:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Most people's asses are cleaner then their hands
[0:54:09] <%TakingLifesL> a warm toilet seat is disturbing
[0:54:12] <%tumzzfestival> HOLDS IT HOLDS IT... HOOOOLDS IT
[0:54:12] <+Snektor> 'scuse me

[0:54:27] <heart_ablaze> why tf is poop censored LUL
[0:54:30] <%Sausious> holding toilet paper is the RIGHT way]
[0:54:30] <$realm_forge> Pat requires toilet paper at eye level at all times
[0:54:30] <%brachydios777> Every time Plauge shows up the stream becomes nonsense way faster
[0:54:34] <+michingmallecho> But seriously, get a bidet everybody. I installed one this week and I love it
[0:54:36] <Rakuto47> Potty rained wrong as a joke
[0:54:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @skyheys Do you have a week off so I can tell you?
[0:54:39] <RyuuAoi> Remember the TP shortage of 2020? Cut it out, Pat!
[0:54:40] <%Ynkubus_> I member, it was 45 mins of nonsense
[0:54:43] <Louie_Salmon> I think you get more of the donations, right?
[0:54:43] <%Bailey__gaming> @sofarfetched what's the little dinosaur?
[0:54:46] <xbb1024> which has the best tax benefit?
[0:54:48] <Mildly_Eccentric> what about when you're at someone else's house and there's NO toilet paper and you know for a fact they keep it in the hallway closet
[0:54:56] <%tumzzfestival> How do we keep money out to pockets of the BIG WIGS at Twitch?

[0:58:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THATS NUTS
[0:58:33] <Ravingpyro> !uptime
[0:58:34] <@commanderclaw> Your friends are babies
[0:58:34] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 58m 49s.
[0:58:36] <%Daniel_Is_I> It depends on the type of game
[0:58:37] <+tigerfang86> sounds like your friend's a BITCH???
[0:58:37] <+malfion> I love you pat
[0:58:38] <%Blackleafx> git gud
[0:58:41] <fuji_92> ????
[0:58:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FINAL BOSS MUST BE HARD
[0:58:42] <%DianaTheAscian> former?
[0:58:42] <+michingmallecho> Coolie? The actor in daredevil?
[0:58:43] <%brachydios777> Wasn’t it Ja Rule at a Gyro place?
[0:58:43] <+skyheys> YOU DONT NEED TO BE ABLE TO BEST A GAME
[0:58:44] <Blank9> sekiro final boss RULES
[0:58:45] <%AncelDeLambert> you boss needs to be narratively RELEVANT, first and foremost
[0:58:47] <ahaegotrigger> making a game hard isnt a bad thing
[0:58:47] <Oxybe> FATALIS OR BUST
[0:58:49] <Profmcstevie> CULMINATION OF SKILL IS GOOD
[0:58:49] <$realm_forge> FILTHY CASUALS
[0:58:50] <%Dova573> Your Final boss SHOULD have a GOOD AS THEME
[0:58:53] <%AncelDeLambert> after that, yeah sure have it be a test
[0:58:55] <+GuyNooN> like demons souls?
[0:58:57] <skeletonknifefight> sekiro final boss is actually too easy
[0:59:00] <xbb1024> just needs to be fulfilling
[0:59:00] <%Monkeyweed21> hey Lahabrea
[0:59:06] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Then the secret boss.
[0:59:10] <@commanderclaw> The Final Boss needs a bomb ass theme though
[0:59:15] <heart_ablaze> dmc 3 says otherwise
[0:59:17] <%Plesin> Kiwami does it with Jingu and then Nishiki
[0:59:21] <%TheMattman1313> The final boss can be weird mechanically/cinematic
[0:59:21] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Test Your Might scrubs
[0:59:21] <%TissueBoxDan> did we play the same sekiro
[0:59:24] <+skyheys> FFX's sucked
[0:59:28] <+BroderQuinho> FF X sucks, though
[0:59:29] <Profmcstevie> Vergil is hard cos DMC is fundamentally a hard series, that's a dump argument
[0:59:29] <%twoto858> I WILL BURN MY DREAD
[0:59:29] <+GuyNooN> EASY MODE UNLOCKED
[0:59:31] <%Not_Dutch_> Just enable a mode that will unlock that is easy
[0:59:33] <%sumrand0> I always loved the way DS 3 did the final boss design
[0:59:34] <RyuuAoi> Pat, do DMC2.
[0:59:39] <@commanderclaw> The Final boss should be a dude in a coat
[0:59:49] <+jiggy_snipe> Final Boss should be a guy like you
[0:59:50] <%tumzzfestival> That IS what that is....
[0:59:52] <%AncelDeLambert> dmcv is too hard for me anyways, so whatever, go nuts with the boss, I'll never see him
[0:59:52] <Profmcstevie> Second form is humanoid size hboxPog
[0:59:53] <%zeif00> The God Beetle
[0:59:54] <RyuuAoi> Basically Peach
[0:59:56] <%derekwst3> Banjo Kazooie has a final boss
[0:59:57] <%TheMattman1313> Just a guy with a sword
[0:59:58] <%animaturgy> Metal Gear Revengeance
[0:59:59] <Zombrocom> The final boss just being a Guy is great
[0:59:59] <+skyheys> DMC2 best game
[1:00:00] <%brachydios777> A guy who is you
[1:00:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GIANT METAL GEAR THEN ARMSTRONG
[1:00:02] <%Divryne> The final boss should always be Vergil. If it isn't your game is trash.
[1:00:03] <%AncelDeLambert> Final boss is a Senator
[1:00:04] <%Daniel_Is_I> Persona tends to do the opposite since the final bosses are basically gods
[1:00:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> The real final boss is "Just the hero of another story"
[1:00:07] <+D00msDayDan> He’s a SENATOR
[1:00:08] <%Jack8274> So Virgil...
[1:00:09] <UlriktheSlayer1> MGR
[1:00:09] <%Bailey__gaming> Bob Normalman
[1:00:11] <%Kataguro> It signifies confidence
[1:00:12] <%sumrand0> aka DS3 final boss
[1:00:14] <%AzureGale> Duel bosses are super rad
[1:00:15] <%Jack8274> It's always coming back to Virgil
[1:00:17] <+bear_breaker20> just ut vergil in every game
[1:00:18] <heart_ablaze> again, dmc 3
[1:00:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> Lavos kept shrinking with each form
[1:00:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @animaturgy aaaaayyyyy
[1:00:22] <megaman_sentinel> yeah Virgil
[1:00:23] <%AncelDeLambert> boss have confidence
[1:00:24] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Secret Bosses should be the real test I guess
[1:00:24] <+MillerLowlife> oh no, he's got all day to kick my ass
[1:00:25] <%tumzzfestival> Jetstream Sam
[1:00:26] <%Plesin> SO NISHIKI
[1:00:27] <+bear_breaker20> put*
[1:00:27] <+PenmanLupine> Killer is Dead final boss
[1:00:28] <+tigerfang86> duel bosses are just the easiest way to generate style
[1:00:31] <+CookieCutter007> SMELL YOU LATER
[1:00:34] <CursedNobleman> i only heard the "Me and woolie are madly in love"

[1:00:46] <%Broken_Sonex> UGH
[1:00:46] <%kewlmyc> BRRRRRRRRRRRR
[1:00:48] <+thickshield> a final boss should be cathartic to fight, so long as that is the case it can be as hard as the devs want. and that includes ball rippingly hard
[1:00:49] <%MidnightBurst12> eww
[1:00:49] <%NovaKnightmare> youre not wrong

[1:01:26] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt That's like saying people liking mobas means people really do like RTS games LUL
[1:01:26] <+skyheys> Basically yes
[1:01:27] <%Kataguro> And have people to play with in person
[1:01:28] <NastiCrimeboy> LUL
[1:01:28] <+deedubbelyuu> Truth
[1:01:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Basically
[1:01:30] <@commanderclaw> Fighting games are made for the FGC
[1:01:31] <+tigerfang86> That's when I DID MY FIGHTING GAMES
[1:01:33] <%Dakuu75> no one likes fighting games. that's a rumor started by the Maximilian_Dood comunity
[1:01:34] <%Monkeyweed21> yea like me
[1:01:38] <%QuipSan> yeah
[1:01:38] <dreamfillah> AND MMOS
[1:01:38] <+malfion> lol I played Sonic during my lectures
[1:01:39] <TheNewJapanGuy> whatever
[1:01:40] <%Jack8274> Smashes smell permeated all of the FGC
[1:01:40] <+bear_breaker20> smart moves means skipping class
[1:01:45] <UlriktheSlayer1> yep
[1:01:46] <%TheMattman1313> But then those people play Battle Royales and Gacha now
[1:01:48] <@commanderclaw> "I'm going to take Combos 201"
[1:01:50] <Oxybe> So World of Warcraft??
[1:01:50] <%GalacticaPhanto> Like you did with 3rd Strike @patstaresat
[1:01:53] <%YakumoYomi> Also the multiple season passes for characters makes fighting games more expensive than most games
[1:01:53] <%sumrand0> Or for Nintendo fans who "like" young people too much
[1:01:53] <%GalacticaPhanto> yeyeye
[1:01:55] <bob900000> what is your favorite fighting game
[1:01:55] <+GuyNooN> the life
[1:01:56] <Louie_Salmon> For Woolie's sake, I will give the League of legends fighting game a chance. That's the only one I will really actually try to master.
[1:01:57] <%Broken_Sonex> FIGHTING GAMES WILL NEVER BE POULAR AGAIN
[1:01:58] <%Jack8274> How did you not smoke more weed back then?
[1:01:58] <+skyheys> that's how you do it, yes
[1:02:02] <%Dementedpenguin> Truthfully, I couldn't get into fighting games because it took away from my other tasks. LUL

[1:02:15] <justinjones1989> Get gud dummy
[1:02:15] <%T_Sasquatch> fighting games require alot of commitment to be able to be at a basic level
[1:02:16] <+BroderQuinho> PREACH

[1:02:27] <Jonny_Uppercut> Can confirm played fighting games AFTER CLASS with friends throughout all of college
[1:02:28] <Otatoptohami> did i make it just in time for the beginning or the end
[1:02:28] <+richmon_> fighting games is a bloated mini game
[1:02:29] <Louie_Salmon> Aren't we all skipping classes?
[1:02:30] <%za7az> @PatStaresAt How does it feel to be old?
[1:02:32] <%brachydios777> Thanks Japan
[1:02:32] <NeetKiller> LUL
[1:02:32] <+bear_breaker20> woolie cant count cause he skipped class
[1:02:33] <%TheMattman1313> Right as fighting games start to comeback God smites them down with a pandemic
[1:02:35] <xbb1024> But Wollie is the teacher now
[1:02:35] <+skyheys> I do that. I hate it.
[1:02:38] <UnlimitedBick> its because you don't want to say slurs on stream
[1:02:41] <+BroderQuinho> Woolie just skip classes to steal pies
[1:02:44] <+BroderQuinho> everyone knows that
[1:02:45] <%Dementedpenguin> I like the concept of fighting games, but I couldn't REALLY get into one.
[1:02:47] <%QuipSan> same
[1:02:47] <blue8moon> I hate those dreams so much
[1:02:50] <meteor530> Hey Pat which is the better buy rtx 3080 or Radeon 6800?
[1:02:51] <+tigerfang86> ooooh
[1:02:51] <fIashman92> I didn't do the major project
[1:02:53] <+tigerfang86> I feel that
[1:02:53] <%tumzzfestival> I walked out of school- I NEVER DREAM of that place.
[1:02:54] <JaydenSai> You didnt study AND the prom is tomorrow! @PatStaresAt
[1:02:54] <%Broken_Sonex> Fighting games are stupid hard to get into. Fuck em
[1:02:54] <%Monkeyweed21> and then a weird fetish thing happens and everyone claps
[1:02:55] <dreamfillah> It's so weird how in certain aspects of game design Japan is so far ahead but in game development they're basically dinosaurs
[1:02:56] <%UvBenServed> And then all your teeth fall out
[1:02:56] <ItsPastas> Big Brain Pat
[1:02:57] <%BoxNavy> ohh....
[1:02:57] <+thickshield> you guys have dreams? :L

[1:03:07] <%TinyLittleDancer> Its called cramming Pat, you aren't special lol
[1:03:08] <%Jack8274> iamsmrt
[1:03:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING

[1:03:10] <Zebroneath> Pat is talentless

[1:03:11] <%Bailey__gaming> Paige cheated with Elise powers

[1:08:35] <jorniev> APARENTLY IT MUST BE
[1:08:36] <%Piemono> Ben's wife has to stare at his beady rat eyes every time they have missionary sex, which is always

[1:09:12] <%KineKithZen> Lewis Black is the new Abe Vigoda
[1:09:13] <%sumrand0> His hate keeps him going
[1:09:14] <theotrainwreck> if you've been watching the stream or listening to Castle Superbeast you get a pretty good idea of where yall are at politically

[1:41:05] <%MonsterEnvy> Why do you have characters in your gang that that have not appeared in sotry yet
[1:41:12] <%Blackleafx> isnt Eri based on some real life japanese lady btw?

[1:41:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt so how much of the capitol can you borrow from for your own "personal" needs since you're still broke and homeless?
[1:41:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @monsterenvy DLC CHEATS
[1:41:34] <SomeAsianDood> @Blackleafx yup her va is eri katamaki in JP
[1:41:37] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> but that is 2,5% that you are losing
[1:41:39] <smikeye> yeah it doesn't matter for profits, but it angers shareholders
[1:41:41] <Blank9> JP boosting accessories stack if you equip two of the same one. Gives x2 JP instead of x1.5.
[1:41:43] <%coreyyotto> because that's unethical
[1:41:43] <+GuyNooN> until story says so
[1:41:44] <UnlimitedBick> @Blackleafx they all are modeled on some lady or another
[1:41:45] <%linSP> thems the rules
[1:41:45] <%Blackleafx> bacaw
[1:41:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> That is called EMBEZZELING
[1:41:52] <%promessav2> too much intergity
[1:41:52] <+Shacklebox> because that would be unethical
[1:41:55] <smikeye> every shareholder meeting at top rank you get 3 million yen
[1:41:56] <%Blackleafx> @SomeAsianDood is she a model or something
[1:41:57] <DashXero> What's Ichiban's salary?
[1:41:58] <+Mitchellsocks> The 2 hours of business last time was strictly overtime, and we were lucky to get it
[1:41:59] <SomeAsianDood> *kamataki
[1:42:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> President Brokeness, the opposite of Jeff Bazos
[1:42:01] <skinmansgds> If the commercial doesn't spawn 1 round into the new4 term, it won't spawn till the next term, if it ever does
[1:42:01] <xbb1024> You only get paid in exec bonuses
[1:42:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's a crime and Ichiban is not a criminal.
[1:42:05] <%juxtest> The yakuza never break the law
[1:42:06] <seniormeatbox> How long do you grind this until you make more money than exists on earth

[1:56:06] <rufus2k2> she's got a gun
[1:56:07] <+supersonic21> Grinding early is worth it
[1:56:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @patstaresat Ichiban's jobs do not have xp boost accessories. He gets an accessory for him only that boosts xp for ANY job

[1:57:11] <huskarl_zap> coomed on note book
[1:57:13] <%SomeOtherNeb> Pat's used to boosters, he always needs one to reach the dinner table
[1:57:18] <%coreyyotto> you already have one

[2:22:38] <Oxybe> Orichalcum thumbtacks
[2:22:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Thumbtack Scatter is one of the best AoE moves in the game.

[2:23:02] <+tigerfang86> SEGA QUIZ

[3:26:41] <huskarl_zap> Juggle Os
[3:26:44] <%thegreatsun> Can't wait until they just change enemy color to show that they are elite
[3:26:44] <+tigerfang86> A LITTLE bit
[3:26:44] <%BoxNavy> nah
[3:26:47] <+tigerfang86> just a little guys
[3:26:49] <Ner234> Just a little
[3:26:49] <@SoFarFetched> thats fine
[3:26:49] <NinjaRed2600> this looks so boring
[3:26:50] <nintega010> sooooo
[3:26:50] <%linSP> so i grinded off stream
[3:26:51] <reonome> A LITTLE YOU SAY
[3:26:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> My favorite sujimon name is PornagraPharaoh
[3:26:53] <akitanito> "a little"
[3:26:53] <%tumzzfestival> MAYBE
[3:26:53] <CrazyMedicine> A little
[3:26:56] <Thalchampz> grinded offscreen
[3:26:57] <Guardiansaiyan> TINY BIT stronger
[3:26:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> you think?
[3:26:59] <wrydiculous> Murdered by crackers
[3:27:01] <MasterTonberry23> thats fine pat, because this sequence is BOOLSHEET
[3:27:01] <JaceDarkstar> just a lil
[3:27:01] <%sumrand0> Whatever gives you that idea
[3:27:02] <Guardiansaiyan> eh
[3:27:04] <+Chewygamer> so I did some grinding off stream
[3:27:04] <NeroInfinite> signature seneb
[3:27:06] <+Link232> You're not that overlevelled, but you do have basically end-game equips
[3:27:08] <+xeros720> nah, these guys are chumps
[3:27:09] <bleugh> did he grind off screen...
[3:27:09] <%Macfine> he big grind
[3:27:12] <dots4eyes> Surely Pat jests
[3:27:12] <+gutlesscoward> what do you mean? eri's lvl 15, it's fine
[3:27:15] <+RaziWraith> definitely not grinding off screen Kappa
[3:27:17] <%cylish> Thats the proper way to RPG though
[3:27:19] <+lordericter> maybe pat got a little to huge offscreen
[3:27:19] <%OfficerMods> dont worry it's not enough to skip the grindfest later
[3:27:22] <+xeros720> you're still in the early parts of the game really
[3:27:22] <+tigerfang86> I think that's a good mark of a good RPG
[3:27:23] <convo445> in terms of equipment not levels
[3:27:25] <%GalacticaPhanto> @ninjared2600 I mean sure? its not for everyone but it's still very good
[3:27:26] <%GreatSmasherPunch> Eh I was killing mobs just like this and I did little to no grinding
[3:27:26] <%Sausious> Ya know I just realized there's no Don Quijote in the game at all
[3:27:28] <+tigerfang86> it's still fun to watch the things happen
[3:27:28] <huskarl_zap> The Prongra Pharaohs are the best
[3:27:28] <+Dundee15> You're only a couple levels up. Are they that big of a diffrence?
[3:27:28] <%Sausious> makes me sad
[3:27:31] <+Chewygamer> moon2WUT
[3:27:33] <+Dundee15> or is it just gear?
[3:27:34] <+GuyNooN> pat fears looking bad on stream more than pants pooping
[3:27:38] <Sunstalker> bleugh He grinded cash out off screen, is all
[3:27:43] <JaceDarkstar> does pat just have unlimited keys?
[3:27:44] <%BoxNavy> if the game didnt want you to have this shit at this point they would lock you off from it
[3:27:45] <%Macfine> If Pat Grinded RL like he grinded RPGs he'd be the Rock
[3:27:45] <+tigerfang86> Pat has some super huge gear
[3:27:46] <tsnakesrule> it's the gear
[3:27:46] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> I was way overlevelled here too, way worse than this
[3:27:54] <+chiazam> I mean if you're not absolutely crushing it, are you even playing an JRPG?
[3:27:56] <+tigerfang86> the power of MONEY
[3:27:57] <haisho> ugh I hate high cut shoes they chafe my ankles HARD
[3:27:59] <%NopeBadguy> mostly he just way outgears the current part of the game
[3:28:01] <%thegreatsun> Same as batman
[3:28:02] <%furiousfurioso> this game has some CRAZY late game difficulty spikes so its fine
[3:28:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GuyNooN clearly that isn't true as we can still see him
[3:28:03] <akitanito> it's jrpg, you're a expected to grind though
[3:28:06] <tsnakesrule> level has no legit difference, gear is massive
[3:28:08] <+Chewygamer> I'm very rich moon2M
[3:28:08] <%BoxNavy> he LOVES it
[3:28:18] <NinjaRed2600> yeah no i don't like turn-based and sadly this isn't changing my mind
[3:28:19] <+tigerfang86> GIVE EM THE THUMBTACKS
[3:28:21] <+tigerfang86> OOF

[3:30:41] <%GalacticaPhanto> Nanba is just a Nevan user
[3:30:42] <+Jaysky> Yeah, this game is turn based and I like it too much. My overwhelming love of turn based games is forcing me to leave the stream. Adios...
[3:30:45] <%BoxNavy> primal psychopath jermaGrin
[3:30:52] <+Chewygamer> Primal Psycopath: good band name
[3:30:55] <+tigerfang86> @brachydios777 when you're a buisiness clerk you just become a ninja, obviously
[3:31:10] <uncle_speeps> i am super down for this series to be turn based from now on
[3:31:13] <%the22cstomp> have a different genre for every new character
[3:31:16] <+Jaysky> Ok I'm back.
[3:31:17] <convo445> like dragon age?
[3:31:18] <tsnakesrule> Mid creation this game was still an action game and only because of how well received the april fools joke got made them change it
[3:31:20] <chaos2frozen> Yakuza - Judgment - Yakuza - Judgment
[3:31:20] <MasterTonberry23> Make Judgment its own series and carry on the beat em up style
[3:31:21] <uncle_speeps> until there's a new character anyway
[3:31:22] <nintega010> @sumrand0 Yeah. I like moving or controling in some way.
[3:31:24] <%Ynkubus_> Fuck it, keep mixing it up
[3:31:25] <+rickelstiltskin> I need dope ass heat moves back
[3:31:25] <%thegreatsun> They should do a shooter
[3:31:25] <%shunakiyama> Judgment 2
[3:31:25] <Sol_Install> yes
[3:31:30] <glitchedmatt1> @PatStaresAt I think Judgement is the brawler series now
[3:31:30] <tattleworm> just make judgment the fight game
[3:31:31] <%tumzzfestival> I can feel them wanting to do EVERYTHING.
[3:31:32] <%GalacticaPhanto> Watch the next one be a card battle game
[3:31:33] <+tigerfang86> make Judgement be the beat em up
[3:31:33] <+teh_rawk> what if the omi guy is a huge phantasy star nerd?
[3:31:35] <akitanito> It's Watase for Asura no?
[3:31:36] <+supersonic21> I need more ichiban games
[3:31:37] <GeltonZ> @tsnakesrule Huh! Did not expect that.
[3:31:38] <OlavOlavsson> @PatStaresAt What if you had a swappable main character that changes the combat?
[3:31:39] <Warbot40> Keep Ichiban rpg
[3:31:41] <notsoy> we have judgment as a template for spinoffs as brawlers
[3:31:42] <%thegreatsun> There should be a CoD style shooter as well
[3:31:42] <%coreyyotto> I'd be down for a Judgment 2
[3:31:43] <huskarl_zap> rpg should be ichiban
[3:31:43] <%Nekros4442> We can just have Judgement be the beatem up
[3:31:43] <+abrupt_abe> Next game should be a medieval Yakuza game in this style
[3:31:45] <%the22cstomp> i think everyone loves ichiban
[3:31:45] <%Daniel_Is_I> I want another 6 games with Ichiban
[3:31:46] <%Garthunox> all ichiban games will be rpg
[3:31:50] <%Xelhesia> ICHIBAN FOR RPG SOUNDS GOOD TO ME
[3:31:50] <+DeltascapeV4> Ichiban or Kiryu, Pat?
[3:31:50] <%Grimlockfly> yeah, i'm down for an ichiban series and whatever alternate year
[3:31:50] <%KineKithZen> Ichiban is the perfect antidote to so many games with Kiryu
[3:31:52] <+Fyre_link> rpg for ichiban, judgment or something else for beat em up
[3:31:57] <+xeros720> that'd be sick as hell to have different game types
[3:31:58] <Sunstalker> Give me a card game nerd main character
[3:31:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Keep Ichiban please
[3:31:59] <NeroInfinite> Yuh the RPG sereis being ichibahn is great
[3:32:01] <%king_wragles> Ya, just have 2 series going at the same time. One for brawling and the other for JRPG
[3:32:01] <robotman37> @thegreatsun They did and it's called dead souls
[3:32:02] <%GalacticaPhanto> @abrupt_abe You mean Isshin?
[3:32:05] <+LandOfTheWay> wait, like an ASURA?! that name's rad as hell!
[3:32:06] <+tigerfang86> THEY ALL DIED
[3:32:06] <%shunakiyama> I'd be unreasonably hype for a Watase solo game. He's one of my favourite Yakuza Side characters
[3:32:07] <%kyh9> Yakuza Monster-Catching spinoff when?
[3:32:07] <+rickelstiltskin> yeeeted
[3:32:08] <thelonechris> Jeez
[3:32:08] <$StrawberryPantsu> Judgment can be the brawler series
[3:32:08] <%kewlmyc> GODDAMN
[3:32:09] <akitanito> JESUS
[3:32:09] <+Jaysky> ow
[3:32:09] <%AngryAsian5> DAAAAMN
[3:32:10] <+tigerfang86> THEY'RE DEAD
[3:32:10] <%KineKithZen> Get tacked
[3:32:10] <dan_g_v> ded
[3:32:11] <wrydiculous> ded
[3:32:12] <+krispen_wa> DEAD
[3:32:13] <NeroInfinite> TECHNOMANCER
[3:32:14] <%Xelhesia> LOL
[3:32:15] <+supersonic21> I think the next one they announce is yakuza 8/like a dragon 2 or kawami 3
[3:32:15] <%RenegadeHatter> This was the greatest April Fools joke of all time
[3:32:15] <JaceDarkstar> damn almost everyone
[3:32:16] <melonsouda> THEY'RE FUCKING DEAD
[3:32:17] <seaechiowai> !uptime
[3:32:17] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 32m.
[3:32:18] <%sumrand0> I appreciate when games aren't cowards & take genuinely big risks by attempting new things with their games. only idiots and children want the same exact thing over and over again
[3:32:18] <MiraLangsuir> GODDAMN ERI
[3:32:19] <%kyh9> Yakuza-mon when?
[3:32:19] <+Chewygamer> those are some sharp thumbtacks
[3:32:20] <Make_me_mad> Throwing those thumbtacks like a fuckin' shotgun blast.
[3:32:21] <GeltonZ> We're all on board with Ichiban the Dragon Quest Hero.
[3:32:21] <+murderof_crows> Leave the brawler stuff to Yagami and mainline series Ichiban
[3:32:21] <uncle_speeps> i'd be super down for judgement taking over the beat em up games
[3:32:25] <Jnkolm> Right now the combat system is... very simple. If they flesh it out like the other games it might be interesting
[3:32:26] <$StrawberryPantsu> They SHOULD make Binary Domain 2
[3:32:27] <+teh_rawk> YAKUZA KIDS, combat is card battles
[3:32:27] <huskarl_zap> theyll keep who ever sticks
[3:32:27] <gslayer14> shotgun throw much?
[3:32:28] <akitanito> Eri too OP
[3:32:29] <JaceDarkstar> officemancer
[3:32:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Kiryu never kills Snitchiban kills regularly
[3:32:33] <Make_me_mad> That was some Hot Shots Part Deux level projectile tossing.
[3:32:34] <+supersonic21> For all we know they could be working on a new engine
[3:32:38] <RealPT1> didn't they try shooter a bit with Dead Souls?
[3:32:39] <pixelpaggos> man this new persona game looks weird.
[3:32:43] <MasterTonberry23> @StrawberryPantsu yes they should, but they wont
[3:32:44] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Ichiban should stick around as protag for a while
[3:32:45] <+geistuser> what if the add random encounters look classic jrpg?
[3:32:50] <%tumzzfestival> Well THEN
[3:32:50] <Sunstalker> Yakuza: shadow of Mordor?
[3:32:53] <%BusterRepukken> @Make_me_mad War. It's fantastic.
[3:32:58] <+teh_rawk> after a while you just use tiger exclusively
[3:33:04] <ghostkingwho> let brawler be spinoffs like judgement, this and persona are the only closets thing we have to AAA turnbased game dammit
[3:33:05] <%Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt You don't like Flux all day everyday
[3:33:07] <lucky_icarus> And Crane style SUCKS compared to Tiger
[3:33:09] <convo445> put pat you don't style switch to begin with
[3:33:10] <haisho> what are okama doing in a dungeon
[3:33:11] <%shunakiyama> Weird i thought Judgment combat was amazing
[3:33:13] <%coreyyotto> That Ki Blast is busted
[3:33:13] <huskarl_zap> underground flashers
[3:33:18] <+Standard_Enemy> This is where perverts live Pat
[3:33:20] <%Sausious> just like Tiger Drop
[3:33:24] <+Chewygamer> Libido
[3:33:25] <%BoxNavy> i dont like the coatmen
[3:33:27] <UnlimitedBick> @Sunstalker massively underutilized Nemesis system
[3:33:33] <%BoxNavy> Libido
[3:33:33] <+tigerfang86> perverts LOVE the sewers pat
[3:33:33] <+teh_rawk> they took that from fist of the north star
[3:33:37] <+murderof_crows> Well I think it sold well. So they might expand it in the next game
[3:33:38] <lucky_icarus> It does SO MUCH and gives A LOT of Heat
[3:33:39] <%twoto858> They're the kobolds that wandered into a beholder's lair
[3:33:40] <+Chewygamer> @BoxNavy homophobe
[3:33:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> I want another majima game
[3:33:46] <%Dragon4234> @Sausious I mean Yagami can learn Tiger Drop too
[3:33:46] <%thegreatsun> I grind my job like a whole year now, how comes i never level up???
[3:33:47] <uncle_speeps> as long as judgement ups it's side content game i would be super down for a judgement 2
[3:33:52] <st_jimmy456> love the term "fuckos"
[3:33:52] <huskarl_zap> just for you pat
[3:33:52] <+murderof_crows> I used the Drunken Fist a lot
[3:33:55] <Meekest> Its a big Yakuza gang
[3:33:55] <%BusterRepukken> This is a very long dungeon btw.
[3:33:57] <%BoxNavy> dont ask
[3:33:58] <%KineKithZen> It's pretty unsanitary in this gross basement
[3:33:59] <%shunakiyama> I personally think Judgment is the Bloodborne of the yakuza series. I think it's the best game in the "Kamurocho" game universe
[3:33:59] <%baronouroboros> It's all in Ichiban's head
[3:34:01] <%weissguard> Yeaaaah, Palm Strike breaks that game like a cook breaking an egg. Then you get Tiger Drop on top of that, and it becomes kinda a joke.
[3:34:03] <+tetraes> I M A G I N A T I O N
[3:34:03] <akitanito> it's FINE
[3:34:04] <convo445> underground hospitals?
[3:34:05] <%TheMattman1313> Kicked out of hospitals
[3:34:05] <%SomeSageAdvice> its his imagination remember lol
[3:34:05] <%Monkeyweed21> blain damblage
[3:34:08] <dinnydanny777> Hosts can be criminals too
[3:34:10] <%tumzzfestival> I love the wordplay so much
[3:34:14] <MasterTonberry23> theyre all really chinese gangster fuckos anyway, its just ichi's imagination
[3:34:15] <MiraLangsuir> They're Imp Patients. Imps+Patients.
[3:34:17] <%BoxNavy> OH NOOOO
[3:34:18] <+tigerfang86> GROSS
[3:34:21] <+tigerfang86> HOLY SHIT EW
[3:34:22] <%Plesin> she got the rona
[3:34:22] <NitronStreams> is that Ishmael?
[3:34:22] <%Sausious> INFECTED
[3:34:22] <nintega010> ewwwwww
[3:34:23] <akitanito> RUDE
[3:34:24] <%Grimlockfly> Ichiban dumb brain imagination, you're actually murdering a hobo colony in the sewer.
[3:34:24] <ProfessorLuigi> COVID

[3:34:25] <RaidenRising> COVID
[3:34:25] <%kewlmyc> JAPANESE COLD, NO
[3:34:26] <$StrawberryPantsu> It's Ichi's imagination
[3:34:26] <huskarl_zap> BIG ANTI PAT ENEMY
[3:34:26] <%brachydios777> Remember when they took a move from Kenshiro directly for Kiryu?
[3:34:27] <%ChaosAethr> a COLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[3:34:27] <UnlimitedBick> dragon quest
[3:34:29] <%AJ_Cherenkov> they're attacking with VIRUS
[3:34:30] <%TheMattman1313> RONA
[3:34:30] <tacoisgoods> she got the covid
[3:34:31] <+rickelstiltskin> THE COOOF!
[3:34:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> The crane game is bullshit
[3:34:32] <haisho> OH NO COVID
[3:34:32] <+Chewygamer> eww he got his juice on you
[3:34:32] <seaechiowai> gross
[3:34:33] <wrydiculous> OH NO THEY ARE COVID PATIENTS
[3:34:33] <NeroInfinite> POISOn
[3:34:37] <%BoxNavy> well yeah
[3:34:37] <+MordoPrime> OHH NOOOO THE COR...COUGH
[3:34:42] <%pectusumbra> I mean it seems to be an underground hobo land
[3:34:44] <ManlyMcBeefington> Cause they are Triad?
[3:34:47] <%Sausious> Poison is ALSO in the game tho
[3:34:47] <%baronouroboros> wow
[3:34:49] <%thegreatsun> not the rona, the wuhan fever
[3:34:50] <ShichiNoBushi> Oh no! Anti-maskers!!
[3:34:50] <KidKaiser23> NOOOO NOT THE RONAAAA
[3:34:51] <huskarl_zap> their final attack is a dirty needle into your arteries
[3:34:51] <%BaybeeBat> cols is also contagious
[3:34:53] <wrydiculous> THAVARUS
[3:34:55] <%BoxNavy> ive been waiting for someone to cough on you and give you poison
[3:34:56] <%BaybeeBat> cold*
[3:34:57] <+Chewygamer> cold is poison, covid is toxic
[3:34:58] <haisho> oh it's just the flu
[3:35:06] <Sunstalker> I would play a fighting game story mode that worked like this.
[3:35:08] <coreyyotto> The thing with Cold is that you can stack it with poison and burn for high damage over time
[3:35:10] <%Puhff> it's also paralysis and spreads to other enemies
[3:35:16] <%tumzzfestival> Covid is a lifestyle.
[3:35:20] <%Macfine> cause its a dungeon
[3:35:28] <UnlimitedBick> @huskarl_zap for doom they inject you with oxygen
[3:35:28] <TurtlesAndTentacles> is Plauge here?
[3:35:30] <redrins> sewer drugs
[3:35:31] <thelonechris> Generic goons live in sewers
[3:35:34] <%coreyyotto> Because they're not even real
[3:35:37] <blue8moon> cause Ichiban only sees generic goons
[3:35:37] <+teh_rawk> they wandered in
[3:35:37] <+Chewygamer> just JRPG things
[3:35:39] <%coreyyotto> Ichiban is just trippin right now, basically
[3:35:40] <MasterTonberry23> they are the chinese crime men doing the crimes pat
[3:35:40] <+krispen_wa> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
[3:35:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Everyone knows Covid isnt real, just ask all those people in the Hospital
[3:35:41] <%brachydios777> Cause dungeon
[3:35:52] <huskarl_zap> @unlimitedbick tru
[3:35:52] <%Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt It's Yokohama's Underground, it isn't a secret tho
[3:35:54] <%BoxNavy> goddammit nanba
[3:35:54] <%pectusumbra> I mean it seems to be a sewer generally
[3:35:55] <%rdark_ksu> sometimes ppl pay goods to hang around just in case. like a security policy
[3:35:56] <ShichiNoBushi> Ichiban's imagination is turning them into generic enemies.
[3:35:57] <+starzo0> if it wasnt like this, we wouldnt have a game
[3:36:00] <%tumzzfestival> That FITS Ichiban.
[3:36:05] <%coreyyotto> Like, these sewers are actually just two hallways but Ichiban internalizes them into this massive dungeon
[3:36:06] <%Sausious> how do you feel about Don Quijote being removed?
[3:36:09] <primarch_lupercal> ichiban has a bad imagination
[3:36:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt how many of these fights do you think are real? I mean with Kiryu we had the hazing thing but with Ichi he could be imagining all these
[3:36:12] <UnlimitedBick> STOP THINKING ABOUT THE SCRIPT THIS IS GAMEPLAY
[3:36:14] <%thegreatsun> Does pat even have any imagination left? or did advance aging drain him of his creative mind??
[3:36:30] <%BoxNavy> i mean everyone else can see em
[3:36:31] <+tigerfang86> maybe like 60% at best
[3:36:31] <%Taisuru> All of them
[3:36:32] <+teh_rawk> is the sewer mementos?
[3:36:33] <akitanito> You are just beating up random hobos who are living here
[3:36:36] <%Macfine> How many of the fights are real? Yes!

[3:37:50] <akitanito> WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
[3:37:51] <%brachydios777> At what point can we say Ichiban’s imagination is schizophrenia?
[3:37:52] <dots4eyes> That flying kick is so good...every time
[3:37:53] <Jonny_Uppercut> She's just Yuffie, the optional ninja girl party member
[3:37:53] <%BoxNavy> monkaS

[3:38:05] <%Macfine> you just open the locker and a corpse flops out
[3:38:07] <+AutechreTwinAphex> this is literally like Final Fantasy 13 now isn't it?
[3:38:09] <%tumzzfestival> All for THAT.
[3:38:09] <+MrMcCrabby> Business ninja
[3:38:09] <xbb1024> nobody in his party was replying
[3:38:10] <%blastyoboots> and how can he use his LEGS if he was trapped in a LOCKER?
[3:38:12] <MasterTonberry23> Everyone else is all "why was Ichi swinging at nothing for two minutes?"
[3:38:13] <Make_me_mad> It's a great... QUESTion.
[3:38:14] <%zajoestar> just makes a bad dungeon even worse
[3:38:15] <MiraLangsuir> DON'T ASK THESE QUESTIONS ITCHY
[3:38:18] <%Taisuru> Great Quest-chan
[3:38:19] <ShichiNoBushi> That HAS to have been entirely in Ichiban's head.
[3:38:24] <UnlimitedBick> NOBODY ANSWERED, FIGHT WAS IMAGINED
[3:38:25] <+Chewygamer> pat not rotating saves SMH
[3:38:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> When did the other Girl join?
[3:38:28] <Meekest> Mementos looks weird
[3:38:30] <Sunstalker> @PatStaresAt Wait, we're forgetting the best option for this new system. Fist of the North Star with this battle system
[3:38:31] <%sumrand0> @brachydios777 well since this is 1000% not how schizophrenia works I'd say no

[3:39:01] <+GuyNooN> if it was any other game I'd be against it tbh
[3:39:02] <+tigerfang86> pretty beefy dudes
[3:39:03] <%Macfine> the ending of this game better be the Main character being arrested for countless homeless people murders
[3:39:04] <Nobuwaroo> why ask if its alright? does it actually matter what we say?
[3:39:04] <MasterTonberry23> this dung gone is gonna take a while, strap in folks

[3:39:27] <%tumzzfestival> @KidKaiser23 A modern experiment for a brave world.
[3:39:29] <%brachydios777> @sumrand0 Oh did I do a bad? might be thinking of something else
[3:39:32] <%pipboy344> NO. MORE YAKUZA
[3:39:33] <%zajoestar> prolly another hr in this dungeon
[3:39:33] <a_mad_dragon> POCKET SAND
[3:39:35] <gslayer14> POCKET SAND
[3:39:38] <gslayer14> SHAHSA
[3:39:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> So long as it isn’t That Other Game
[3:39:49] <dots4eyes> Too bad I can't resist sand IRL
[3:39:58] <UnlimitedBick> @pipboy344 I agree, no more yakuza
[3:40:04] <+AutechreTwinAphex> very gutsy of Sega to turn this into a JRPG AND debut it only on Xbox on nextgen - I just hope sales won't crater as a result
[3:40:08] <ghostkingwho> why didn't bluepoint remame Demon Souls as a turnbased jrpg? cowards
[3:40:08] <%sumrand0> @brachydios777 no worries man
[3:40:10] <+GuyNooN> Actually Pat has to go play more bugsnax now
[3:40:12] <%BaybeeBat> you get like 70k xp from the vagabonds in here
[3:40:33] <%pipboy344> MORE YAKUZA PLEASE. No money can't buy on xbox
[3:40:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> Wait a tic... is Nanba Japanese Dale Gribble?
[3:40:46] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> it'd be great if Majima just randomly popped out of one of those safes.
[3:40:46] <+AutechreTwinAphex> you can buy it on PC and PS4 right now too
[3:40:52] <%blastyoboots> everything you open in here is gonna be bad... except the ONE SAFE you DON'T OPEN
[3:40:54] <%BoxNavy> how do i delete bugsnax from everyones memories and existence
[3:40:55] <akitanito> this dungeon is massive
[3:40:57] <%Quigsies> Quigsies subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Hey Pat, this game rules! I hope they stick with the rpg formula, or at the very least with ichiban as the new protagonist!
[3:41:03] <%BoxNavy> all
[3:41:06] <thelonechris> All of them
[3:41:08] <MasterTonberry23> @rumtumtugnutz i think of him as big hair kojima
[3:41:09] <%Ynkubus_> All of them
[3:41:09] <%Taisuru> ALL OF THEM
[3:41:09] <redrins> at least 2
[3:41:12] <UnlimitedBick> @AutechreTwinAphex still no money, brother
[3:41:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt that is me
[3:41:15] <%tumzzfestival> LUL
[3:41:17] <%BoxNavy> this place is just fucked up
[3:41:17] <huskarl_zap> all
[3:41:18] <dinnydanny777> Bugsnax best game
[3:41:19] <%Sausious> all of them
[3:41:23] <%zajoestar> not like many people are playing next gen consoles right now anyways
[3:41:24] <CrimsonFox777> @BoxNavy You can't. Embrace the Bugsnax.
[3:41:25] <%sumrand0> Too bad Demon Souls isn't getting a PC release as far as I know. I really dont wanna waste money on a Playstation 5
[3:41:26] <%Macfine> janitors don't usally travel in packs
[3:41:29] <$Afterman_> those are the real fights
[3:41:30] <akitanito> They are all real, the question is whether they are actually hostile
[3:41:32] <%pectusumbra> I mean all of them, characters are getting stronger
[3:41:33] <%tumzzfestival> It's about mental violence.
[3:41:34] <$StrawberryPantsu> NONE
[3:41:34] <%Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt All of them Ichiban just imagines they look different
[3:41:34] <%brachydios777> @sumrand0 What’s a condition where you see things that’s not real?
[3:41:37] <Jonny_Uppercut> It's the Yakuza world, all the fights are real, there's always goons in the streets wanting to fight
[3:41:39] <+AutechreTwinAphex> this looks so much like Final Fantasy 13 it's unreal for a Yakuza game
[3:41:39] <%Alazull> every one of them, just the details are in his head
[3:41:40] <coffeebearCafe> I bet none lol
[3:41:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> I hon
[3:41:40] <UnlimitedBick> weird basement lol
[3:41:44] <rosemon5001> you never know when the chinese they are evil LUL Kappa
[3:41:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> I hi
[3:41:45] <%GalacticaPhanto> They're all real. just not the enemies you see tho
[3:41:49] <GeltonZ> What if...the battle are the only part that IS real!
[3:41:49] <$StrawberryPantsu> Not even the boss fights
[3:41:51] <robotman37> That man was actually stabbed
[3:41:52] <%BoxNavy> Jebaited
[3:41:56] <%thegreatsun> how many keys???
[3:41:56] <%Taisuru> Pat, consider the insane amounts of people kiryu has to fight on the way to a grocery store.
[3:41:57] <reonome> crazy talk
[3:41:59] <%tumzzfestival> You're fighting on a metaphysical plain.
[3:42:01] <akitanito> crazy talk worked in your favour
[3:42:01] <Ner234> Shocked
[3:42:04] <%HitchhikingThrough> you were warned
[3:42:05] <Guardiansaiyan> REKT
[3:42:05] <+twohitgood> is there any indication if a safe is a mimic?
[3:42:05] <GustauveVIII> i think the fighting of this game is good, but most of the dungeons are stupid garbagely too long
[3:42:05] <wrydiculous> hey crazy talk helped out
[3:42:06] <%shocknawful> if theyre real theyre normal thugs that have "transformed"
[3:42:06] <+AutechreTwinAphex> this kind of dungeon design is literally FF7R but with turn based combat
[3:42:06] <+Standard_Enemy> Havel's Armor is in the one on the left
[3:42:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ichi is going crazy cause of his infected bullet wound.
[3:42:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Taisuru that is because Yakuzas send them after Kiryu as a hazing ritual
[3:42:26] <dots4eyes> Plot twist: The whole gang is just watching Ichiban fight ghosts.
[3:42:29] <+tigerfang86> NOT A LOSER
[3:42:31] <%tumzzfestival> Reminding me of Ichi the Killer
[3:42:32] <Ner234> You opend those three chests now you can't get the ZOdiac Spear
[3:42:33] <%arancet> run itchy run
[3:42:37] <+CannonHeroBrett> @sumrand0 Theres no reason to purchase one right now we still dont know really most of the games in dev
[3:42:38] <%Alazull> rumtum that makes a lot of sense
[3:42:44] <+SinisterBroccoli> why does he say Not a loser?
[3:42:50] <OlavOlavsson> So is this the real spiritual successor to Chrono Trigger?
[3:42:51] <huskarl_zap> Sactified with dynamite
[3:42:52] <%sumrand0> @brachydios777 theres several conditions which prominently feature hallucinations but most of the time they're auditory hallucinations. visual hallucinations are infinitely less common among tbe various conditions
[3:43:00] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:43:03] <%Garthunox> @Ner234 ow, this actually stung
[3:43:06] <Sunstalker> Self destruct
[3:43:06] <the_createy> kamikaze
[3:43:07] <%Taisuru> SELF DESTRUCT
[3:43:08] <akitanito> probably suicide
[3:43:10] <%Macfine> never lit dynamite on your belt..
[3:43:11] <rosemon5001> ANELE ANELE ANELE
[3:43:12] <%cvp5127> kamikaze?
[3:43:13] <%tumzzfestival> Seems like it has to be.
[3:43:13] <%coreyyotto> He lights the bomb first turn then throws it next turn
[3:43:14] <melonsouda> I would assume so
[3:43:17] <%Alazull> grenade
[3:43:17] <thebehatted> maybe a strong attack that reqires a turn to use
[3:43:25] <+AutechreTwinAphex> Demon's Souls is a great launch game, can't think of a better launch game TBH for PS5
[3:43:34] <%MelBrooksKA> Solar beam
[3:43:35] <highfivesquash> is that simon from simon and garfunkel beating up a japanese engineer in a sewer?
[3:43:38] <+AutechreTwinAphex> I'd say PS5 is worth it right now for that and 4K 60fps Nioh 2 alone
[3:43:39] <+MrMcCrabby> Its probably a setup for a big nuke
[3:43:41] <%Alazull> @patstaresat they throw it the turn after they light it
[3:43:42] <+CannonHeroBrett> @AutechreTwinAphex Dragons Dogma 2
[3:43:43] <dots4eyes> Get hit by it and you'll find out :)
[3:43:46] <+GuyNooN> @AutechreTwinAphex Bloodborne 2
[3:43:47] <+krispen_wa> demon souls is a great PS3 launch title
[3:43:47] <Ner234> @Garthunox It's been years and I'm STILL mad about FFXII nonsense LUL
[3:43:50] <%tumzzfestival> HALLUCINATING
[3:43:51] <%Dragon4234> @AutechreTwinAphex Bloodborne 2?
[3:43:52] <MasterTonberry23> they throw a bundle of dynamite that does mid aoe fire damae
[3:43:52] <akitanito> thumbtack!
[3:43:53] <%slrls_> streamer!
[3:43:54] <colzack_> So I walked away for a bit, how's Pat liking this dungeon?
[3:43:55] <haisho> Twitchy Streamer?!

[3:43:56] <%the22cstomp> TWITCHY STREAMER NO

[3:44:07] <+Just_GR> LUL
[3:44:09] <%AngryAsian5> GET FUCKED
[3:44:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> RIP
[3:44:12] <%sumrand0> @cannonherobrett yeah I'm really hoping Sony keeps releasing more exclusives on PC after a while at least, I finally got a good gaming PC I don't wanna need to buy a console again just for exclusives
[3:44:13] <%BoxNavy> no
[3:44:18] <huskarl_zap> PAT D E F E A T E D
[3:44:20] <+tigerfang86> no
[3:44:20] <%tumzzfestival> WAIT
[3:44:20] <akitanito> pat died on stream
[3:44:22] <%Ynkubus_> Twitch on Twitch violence is real
[3:44:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> no
[3:44:24] <GeltonZ> NOPE
[3:44:24] <%the22cstomp> i cant let that go
[3:44:26] <%walternatorz> MURDER SURE SOLVES A LOT OF PROBLEMS
[3:44:28] <%luketrapwalker> I saw nothing
[3:44:29] <%BoxNavy> i wonder what the enemy names are in japanese
[3:44:29] <diodude_> you killed your own kind
[3:44:30] <MasterTonberry23> dont worry it was ninja
[3:44:30] <convo445> look at the bestiary for him
[3:44:32] <+AutechreTwinAphex> you don't want a Bloodborne 2, you want to be amazed by a new experience
[3:44:37] <%HitchhikingThrough> And so in the end, it was Pat who killed Woolie
[3:44:37] <%snow_bush> He's just Chatting in Hell now.
[3:44:39] <rosemon5001> what are you talking aboot? Kappa
[3:44:41] <CrimsonFox777> Oh no, Jerma's dead!
[3:44:43] <%blastyoboots> thats how to deal with the competition
[3:44:45] <+AutechreTwinAphex> you think you want Bloodborne 2 but you don't
[3:44:45] <NeroInfinite> I refuse to ignore it
[3:44:51] <%za7az> I have seen things you wouldn't believe WutFace
[3:44:52] <%T_Sasquatch> @AutechreTwinAphex no I want a fucking bloodborne 2
[3:44:56] <%T_Sasquatch> fuck sekiro
[3:44:58] <%sumrand0> Pat just stream snipes that twitchy steamer!
[3:44:58] <%BoxNavy> @AutechreTwinAphex i want trick weapons back at least moon2W
[3:45:00] <+starzo0> @AutechreTwinAphex what if i want both?
[3:45:05] <+AutechreTwinAphex> Bloodborne 2 would turn into something like Dark Souls 2, it'd be like 'yeah here is the same thing again, meh I guess'
[3:45:06] <%T_Sasquatch> gimme old thing sequel
[3:45:17] <%Ynkubus_> @AutechreTwinAphex You're right, I want Bloodborne kart
[3:45:18] <%T_Sasquatch> ok and ?
[3:45:20] <%the22cstomp> how did eri backflip in heels wtf
[3:45:21] <%T_Sasquatch> gimme
[3:45:22] <CrimsonFox777> Is this the power of friendship?
[3:45:30] <%tumzzfestival> DAMN
[3:45:32] <huskarl_zap> yeah fuck one of the only new ips to release in 5 years
[3:45:34] <Berendenn> I just got here is there an explanation on why Eri is a ninja
[3:45:37] <%sumrand0> Bloodborne on PC would totally get modded into Bloodborne 2
[3:45:41] <%T_Sasquatch> people talk shit about ds2 like its not a good game LUL
[3:45:43] <$Afterman_> pat you gonna play age of calamity? either on stream or off?
[3:45:45] <UnlimitedBick> I really wish there were combos like Nanba's flamethrow and Breaker's windmill could make a fire tornado or somthing
[3:45:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The game does not explain why Eri is a ninja
[3:45:49] <%MorelK> totally pointless
[3:45:49] <%Huntercd> She's a clerk
[3:45:49] <akitanito> because she's an office clerk
[3:45:52] <$Afterman_> it did
[3:45:52] <Meekest> Its out
[3:45:53] <%Daniel_Is_I> Yes
[3:45:53] <thelonechris> Yes
[3:45:54] <+SinisterBroccoli> if a game is good grinding should be pointless
[3:45:55] <$Afterman_> and yes
[3:45:56] <+GuyNooN> MIESSED AN ITEM REEEEEEEE
[3:45:56] <%NopeBadguy> TODAY
[3:45:56] <Sunstalker> What if Fromsoftware made another Mech Warrior but it's underwater and you fight scary cthulu shit. monkaS
[3:45:57] <%Daniel_Is_I> It came out today
[3:45:57] <+CannonHeroBrett> @sumrand0 eh...i just enjoy video games man if the game i really want is only on a console thats where im getting it i have no gripes about it
[3:45:58] <MasterTonberry23> @Berendenn what do you mean, all office workers are ninjas
[3:45:59] <VritraReiRei> Missed item @PatStaresAt
[3:46:01] <Dumple_Roe> yes and yes
[3:46:02] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @huskarl_zap nah it's more like we know Miyazaki and his team can knock out entirely new games in under 2/3 years - I'd rather have that than endless sequels like so many other companies do
[3:46:03] <+twohitgood> it's out today
[3:46:03] <%Jaller101514> today
[3:46:03] <%the22cstomp> framerate issues but it is good
[3:46:03] <%QuipSan> today
[3:46:04] <reonome> yes and yes
[3:46:04] <akitanito> didn't plague said so yesterday?
[3:46:05] <Meekest> Its a warriors game so you won't know if its good for a week
[3:46:06] <%arancet> yes and yes
[3:46:06] <%Maruko19> It's okay
[3:46:06] <%Alazull> this is the mystery dungeon for grinding after you get out
[3:46:07] <Berendenn> fair
[3:46:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AutechreTwinAphex you are being hunted for destroying the source of blood minestration but an old god gave you access to the dream to let you suffer endlessly
[3:46:09] <%brachydios777> Yea
[3:46:10] <+tigerfang86> every office clerk is a ninja
[3:46:10] <%kewlmyc> Came out today, and it's a Musou, so your mileage may vary
[3:46:11] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Hyrule Warriors was wayyyyy better tho
[3:46:11] <$Afterman_> its very fun so far
[3:46:11] <Jonny_Uppercut> @Berendenn Cuz she's a Yuffie surrogate, no real reason beyond that
[3:46:11] <ShiningAxis> wait until people stop getting dmca'd for it
[3:46:12] <seaechiowai> DxCat
[3:46:12] <+tigerfang86> that's canon
[3:46:12] <%JaydenSai> Yes and Yes
[3:46:13] <Daxalog> Age of what now?
[3:46:13] <%Daniel_Is_I> It has framedrops but it's not bad
[3:46:14] <Make_me_mad> Age of Calamity came out today. I like it, but also I like the occassional warriors game.
[3:46:14] <OlavOlavsson> ds2 was like legend of zelda 2 but not as extreme
[3:46:15] <%superc37> time travel shit aside, yeah
[3:46:15] <Louie_Salmon> It seems cool, but like, fuck, those games are infinity hours long
[3:46:15] <$Afterman_> framerate better than demo
[3:46:16] <+Pyroclase> Hyrule Reach is still hilarious to me
[3:46:16] <Dumple_Roe> a bit choppy
[3:46:16] <%cvp5127> LUL
[3:46:16] <haisho> it's a Musou game. Base your answer off that
[3:46:18] <%Maruko19> Ass
[3:46:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt it unlocked last night, and it's excellent
[3:46:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @unlimitedbick There are, but not a lot. Everyone gets 1 combo move at bond level 5.
[3:46:19] <%QuipSan> bad
[3:46:20] <neraren> Its stuttering
[3:46:20] <%BoxNavy> i keep thinking age of calamity is some new RTS but its the zelda thing
[3:46:21] <$Afterman_> first few missions sucks but other than that
[3:46:23] <%kewlmyc> framerate is very mediocre
[3:46:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Worse than Hyrule Warriors
[3:46:23] <dinnydanny777> Yes
[3:46:24] <%the22cstomp> it's a warriors game
[3:46:25] <%arancet> framerates ok in singleplayer, bad in multi
[3:46:25] <%Sausious> it's on switch,
[3:46:27] <%W1nterTitan> Some issues for sure
[3:46:28] <Garrison27> Why is that office lady doing backflips?
[3:46:29] <dinnydanny777> It's good
[3:46:32] <KingVantq> switch fps LUL
[3:46:32] <CrimsonFox777> Can you believe they had to drag you all this way just to question you?
[3:46:32] <rosemon5001> the retcon is worse
[3:46:33] <%derekwst3> so far its fine, the choppy on full screen but handheld is nicer
[3:46:34] <Jnkolm> If you like Dynasty Warriors it's pretty darn good
[3:46:37] <Louie_Salmon> Wait on that PC version
[3:46:41] <+AutechreTwinAphex> 18-20fps musou zelda? yeah no thanks
[3:46:42] <akitanito> OLs are ninjas
[3:46:42] <+Draco_Aeris> framerate is canon
[3:46:44] <@SoFarFetched> I like how everyone went from "OH YEAH ITS GOOD" but as soon as the framerate got mentioned,got switched to "oh it's bad"
[3:46:47] <MasterTonberry23> did you like the first hyrule warriors? because aoc is just that again
[3:46:47] <%brachydios777> But Urbosa though
[3:46:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> WHEN IS BOTW2
[3:46:56] <OlavOlavsson> @PatStaresAt You mean the New Nintendo Switch?
[3:46:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> God damn it
[3:47:05] <+AutechreTwinAphex> Koei Tecmo are good devs though, Nioh 2 is awesome, if that mousou zelda game was 60fps I'd play it
[3:47:05] <uncle_speeps> hw1 was better anyway
[3:47:06] <+Standard_Enemy> Sewer Dragon?
[3:47:10] <%coreyyotto> The Switch Up
[3:47:10] <dinnydanny777> @mastertonberry23 It plays nothing like Hyrule Warriors at all
[3:47:11] <%HitchhikingThrough> fuck
[3:47:12] <xbb1024> Have we done the Eri song yet?
[3:47:12] <Guardiansaiyan> lol
[3:47:16] <%W1nterTitan> @brachydios777 A man of culture as well.
[3:47:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @MasterTonberry23 that is literally not true at all
[3:47:16] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Doesnt have nearly as much stuff as Hyrule Warriors had
[3:47:16] <+twohitgood> they're really churning out those mussou games. p5s and now calamity....but i guess that's what they do.
[3:47:19] <%tumzzfestival> Framerate: I can definitely tell. I swear.
[3:47:21] <haisho> OH NO
[3:47:21] <+tigerfang86> HE WAS STREAMING THE PERVERTS
[3:47:23] <+tigerfang86> OH NO
[3:47:23] <Ner234> You know why
[3:47:24] <%Sausious> now you have your answer
[3:47:25] <akitanito> they were ganging up on the streamer
[3:47:26] <%Grimlockfly> Git Twitchied
[3:47:27] <Dumple_Roe> @louie_salmon it has Nintendo characters, it nullified the pc release
[3:47:28] <%Garthunox> @xbb1024 yes
[3:47:29] <+AutechreTwinAphex> 18-20fps though is unplayable garbage I'm sorry, I'll care about Nintendo again when they have better hardware

[3:47:41] <%the22cstomp> right in the balls
[3:47:44] <xxshadowxx416> switch series pro xl
[3:47:44] <%T_Sasquatch> yikes
[3:47:46] <%pectusumbra> wait what?
[3:47:49] <CurrySauseBandit> Smash streamers? Kappa
[3:47:50] <GeltonZ> @twohitgood It is indeed what they do...and they gotta make up for lost time due to Dynasty Warriors 8
[3:47:51] <dots4eyes> So you're saying perverts aren't weird?
[3:47:53] <neraren> Get Content ID'd, Twitchy streamer
[3:47:53] <akitanito> moral: never be a flasher in front of someone who throws thumbtacks
[3:47:55] <skyentombment> Man, it's been fucking ages since we've even mention the Arakawa family
[3:48:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Plesin I would LEGIT play a character action on smash rules
[3:48:04] <haisho> oh god beefcakes
[3:48:05] <NitronStreams> BEEF CAKE
[3:48:06] <%BaybeeBat> its a story dungeon
[3:48:08] <+MrMcCrabby> Kill all the twitchy streamers
[3:48:09] <GeltonZ> @twohitgood 9 I mean. DW9. The disaster.
[3:48:12] <%HitchhikingThrough> ran out of budget
[3:48:12] <NeroInfinite> BEEFCAKE
[3:48:12] <akitanito> It's a modern jrpg
[3:48:14] <randomahole> @currysausebandit LUL
[3:48:15] <%sumrand0> @cannonherobrett yeah but $500 for a box just to play one or two specific games is rediculous for anyone who isnt a trust fund kiddie. I love games thats why I finally bought a quality PC since the library here is infinitely bigger than Sony and Microsoft combined especially since so much of those console libraries also exist on PC
[3:48:16] <huskarl_zap> Pat in that dungeon with 5 perverts looking for ghost porn
[3:48:16] <+AutechreTwinAphex> Nintendo really dropped the ball this gen honestly, Astro's Playroom is the kind of marriage between tech and gameplay that Nintendo would do in the past
[3:48:21] <%BoxNavy> its not a great dungeon if were being honest
[3:48:21] <FstSergeant8595> this reminds me of those dungeons that never end in FF15
[3:48:22] <%twoto858> Yeah, the dungeons in this game aren't great
[3:48:24] <UnlimitedBick> @skyentombment Remember when Ichiban got shot in the chest
[3:48:29] <seaechiowai> maybe there are hidden walls
[3:48:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's the worst dungeon in the game.
[3:48:40] <%zajoestar> it bad
[3:48:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Because it's boring.
[3:48:44] <+AutechreTwinAphex> yeah it's like they took the worst elements of JRPGs and decided to import that into Yakuza too for whatever reason
[3:48:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> As someone who has both Hyrule Warriors (all 3 versions) and Age of Calamity, Age does plenty of streamlining and sticks very stronger to BOTW's lore and mechanics
[3:48:48] <Guardiansaiyan> W A L L CHICKENS
[3:48:49] <neraren> Exterior collisions time!\
[3:48:50] <huskarl_zap> also Chads on deck
[3:48:55] <+AutechreTwinAphex> it's like you're fighting in the FF7R sewers area that everyone hated
[3:49:00] <UnlimitedBick> Boy that legendary hero bat sure is something
[3:49:04] <%AJ_Cherenkov> it's also sewer-adjacent
[3:49:11] <+tigerfang86> in the before times
[3:49:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah probably.
[3:49:16] <+tigerfang86> before the game was totally rad
[3:49:18] <skyentombment> @skyentombment yeah, but that was like 3 sessions ago, I thought they'd have a bigger role
[3:49:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's very very basic.
[3:49:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Hyrule Warriors is Zelda fan service, Age is Zelda canon with with fixes
[3:49:24] <MasterTonberry23> it feels kinda like a holdover from before they finalized on making this an rpg
[3:49:32] <+AutechreTwinAphex> sewers/underground areas always suck ass because it's an excuse to have dozens of copy paste rooms everywhere
[3:49:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tigerfang86 in the before fore
[3:49:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah it does.
[3:49:37] <FstSergeant8595> sewer levels are never good in any game ever, including silent hill 3
[3:49:41] <%BoxNavy> finally moon2W
[3:49:52] <%BoxNavy> OH NOOOO
[3:49:55] <akitanito> You will never fight fatbergs in sewers
[3:49:57] <+tigerfang86> great job Eri
[3:49:59] <$Afterman_> the ai didnt break nice
[3:50:04] <%BoxNavy> dude if you got softlocked
[3:50:11] <MasterTonberry23> wow the ai didnt get stuck on the wall, amazing
[3:50:12] <UnlimitedBick> YOU'RE DOING GREAT, SWEETIE
[3:50:17] <%Sausious> there are times AI can't figure it out and WILL just teleport them
[3:50:18] <seaechiowai> @fst I like sewers in ff7/ff7r
[3:50:20] <+AutechreTwinAphex> yeah with this kind of game design and being only on xbox on next-gen - good luck with sales Sega, they need those sales now more than ever
[3:50:21] <%sumrand0> DEFEAT THE FAT EVIL
[3:50:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Surprise you didnt get softlocked XD
[3:50:27] <%zajoestar> half way point
[3:50:29] <tsnakesrule> Eri teleports if she's fqr away amd using thumbtacks
[3:50:34] <%Broken_Sonex> The only sewer level i liked was the one in KOTOR 1
[3:50:36] <+StrifeZubia> AI just teleports to the enemy after about ten seconds of ineffectual running
[3:50:39] <+tigerfang86> DID HE JUST WHACK HIM IN THE NUTS
[3:50:40] <melonsouda> Right in the balls. Nice
[3:50:41] <%arancet> get 'im itchy!
[3:50:43] <+tigerfang86> WITH HIS LIGHTNING BAT
[3:50:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I will say I wouldn't have expected Pat to even be interested in streaming Age of Calamity considering he didn't play Breath of the Wild much on stream except wit hteh Best Friends and I haev never seen him play a Zelda game on his own channels
[3:50:58] <+AutechreTwinAphex> reminds me of one of those Persona 4 dungeons before Persona 5 got actual 'good' non random dungeons
[3:51:03] <UnlimitedBick> @Broken_Sonex I agree but we're both wrong.
[3:51:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> let alone a Musou game
[3:51:08] <+DigitalPelican> There's no way they dragged 4 dudes down here just to tie them up in chains
[3:51:16] <+CannonHeroBrett> @sumrand0 Dude relax i was just saying ill play my games anywhere if thats where they are im not sure where you got trust fund kiddie from...
[3:51:22] <Daxalog> Opening that vault made you more charismatic
[3:51:23] <akitanito> yakuza musou when
[3:51:27] <%T_Sasquatch> Shhh dont think about it
[3:51:29] <seaechiowai> what do you want mimics for
[3:51:30] <huskarl_zap> PSEUDO TRASH
[3:51:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> ITS PAT
[3:51:32] <+tigerfang86> PSEUDOTRASH
[3:51:34] <haisho> OH THESE GUYS
[3:51:35] <Jonny_Uppercut> Pat gonna play Majora's Mask to show how easy it is
[3:51:36] <Daxalog> uh oh
[3:51:37] <+tigerfang86> P S E U D O T R A S H
[3:51:37] <%walternatorz> trash mimics
[3:51:38] <+twohitgood> fucking kappa trash
[3:51:40] <%tumzzfestival> That's VERY suspicious..
[3:51:42] <thebehatted> hey I'm in this game
[3:51:44] <Mitchell87mc> who saw that dead pool 3 is happening but sadly Disney replace the writers
[3:51:44] <UnlimitedBick> @sumrand0 spelled ridiculous wrong, discarded opinion
[3:51:51] <+twohitgood> it's not just pseudotrash, it's kappa trash.
[3:51:52] <haisho> I remember seeing these guys in the promotional stuff
[3:51:53] <chestersan> it's the trash man
[3:51:56] <+AutechreTwinAphex> yeah this kind of stuff feels like padding - everything in the city is great but these underground sections is a momentum killer
[3:51:56] <%Huntercd> You wanted mimics Pat
[3:51:58] <dots4eyes> Are those Wooliemen?
[3:52:07] <%thegreatsun> that run is A+
[3:52:08] <%tumzzfestival> HEY NOW
[3:52:14] <+A_Tired_Dad> only pseudotrash, not full trash.... amateurs
[3:52:18] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt when finish Final Fantasy 12 on stream?
[3:52:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt and Is said I barely saw you play Breath of the Wild except during the Best Friend days, but you skipped Link's Awakening and never seen you play other Zelda games on channel
[3:52:25] <%BoxNavy> TRASH
[3:52:27] <akitanito> TRASH
[3:52:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat
[3:52:33] <huskarl_zap> there needs to be a webm of ichiban walking up to a pseudo trash saying garbage day and then shoot it
[3:52:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Suit O Trash
[3:52:40] <dinnydanny777> @jonny_uppercut I'd love that ngl LUL
[3:52:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dots4eyes no that is the village hidden in the trash no pseudotrash
[3:52:44] <%Chatterbox1991> its Rise-Chan
[3:52:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pseudo Trash
[3:52:44] <+AutechreTwinAphex> these loading screens should have just been cut out for Series X LOL
[3:52:45] <%brachydios777> TRASH MEN
[3:52:46] <haisho> it was the trash room
[3:52:48] <%thegreatsun> is there an end to this?
[3:52:57] <yukin0tora> How long is this dungeon?
[3:53:00] <%Chatterbox1991> jk Rise is the best girl
[3:53:01] <haisho> where the psuedotrash were slowly metamorphosing into true trash
[3:53:02] <%twoto858> Wait, weren't you just on B2F?
[3:53:06] <rosemon5001> i feel like whenever BOTW2 comes out if its nowhere near the item system genshin has i feel like it will drop hard
[3:53:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ryan Reynolds apparently chose some of the Bobs Burgers writers for Deadpool 3. That seems ok.
[3:53:08] <+AutechreTwinAphex> yeah man this is the FF7R sewers area all over again
[3:53:09] <melonsouda> That rooms might have been some kind of miniboss room in the beat em up build of the game
[3:53:09] <%Grimlockfly> right?
[3:53:10] <%BoxNavy> yeah. jeez.
[3:53:16] <Jonny_Uppercut> @dinnydanny777 He was joking about it at the start of the stream cuz him and Paige were talking about Game Grumps ayaSMUG
[3:53:16] <UnlimitedBick> @thegreatsun death
[3:53:16] <%BaybeeBat> i think this is the last floor
[3:53:20] <Sapphire_Breeze> @yukin0tora longer than it should be
[3:53:26] <colzack_> It's a full on dungeon so yeah
[3:53:26] <akitanito> imagine if you weren't overgeared
[3:53:33] <redrins> itll make sense why after
[3:53:37] <%tumzzfestival> I don't want your mixtape, sir!
[3:53:39] <+SinisterBroccoli> This is like a really good version of the South Park rpgs
[3:53:40] <+AutechreTwinAphex> they definitely need to drop these dungeons for a Yakuza 8 or make them far more interesting
[3:53:45] <skyentombment> I like Namba's smug face when he pulls out the album
[3:53:57] <akitanito> oh man, the south park games were great
[3:54:00] <%BoxNavy> when will they start dumping puzzles on you in the dungeons
[3:54:02] <thelonechris> monkaS
[3:54:06] <colzack_> yeah there's a reason this is really long that'll be explained after
[3:54:07] <%zajoestar> i wonder if in the brawler version of this game if their was still party members or if ichiban was just by himself
[3:54:08] <%sumrand0> @cannonherobrett i wasn't trying to attack you i was just explaining that spending $500 + $60 just to play a specific game is pretty absurd. If you're saying you're playing all your games on PS5 that's fine but if you own a PC and bought a PS5 JUST to play something like Demon Souls then THAT'S what I'm saying is absurd. but hey you do you man: sorry if you felt insulted that wasnt the intention
[3:54:12] <%tumzzfestival> Guitar made Pat cough?
[3:54:15] <%ChaosAethr> Pat dont Die
[3:54:22] <NeroInfinite> Pat dieing oons tream nothing unusual there
[3:54:22] <%linSP> how to breathe
[3:54:23] <ProfessorLuigi> bruh
[3:54:23] <CrimsonFox777> Pat has the Covid. Paige is gonna die. monkaS
[3:54:26] <haisho> oh no that is old people problems
[3:54:30] <%tumzzfestival> silly Pat
[3:54:31] <melonsouda> Then don't inhale spit Pat.
[3:54:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt BTW you said 0, 4, 5, Kawami 2, Judgement and 7 are the worthwhile Yakuza's to buy right? Kawami 2 and Judgment are on deep Black Friday Sale right now (especially on PSN)
[3:54:34] <redrins> the dungeon after this one is honestly pretty good
[3:54:41] <+Ryuuken1789> Yeah, I hate when that happens
[3:54:44] <Jolly_Adventurer> How do youinhale spit?
[3:54:53] <huskarl_zap> new poll, will pat drown on his own spit on stream
[3:54:57] <%the22cstomp> ichiban no that kills people
[3:55:01] <FstSergeant8595> @sumrand0 tbf I also was going to buy a ps5 pretty much just for DeS, alas they are nonexistant
[3:55:05] <UnlimitedBick> @zajoestar i think the party is why the game is turn based
[3:55:07] <%BoxNavy> OH NO
[3:55:11] <%tumzzfestival> OKAY
[3:55:12] <haisho> OH GOD
[3:55:14] <%BaybeeBat> !FEAR!
[3:55:16] <huskarl_zap> oh no it was yuge
[3:55:17] <%Sausious> FEAR the peenor
[3:55:17] <CrimsonFox777> It's ok, he had boxers.
[3:55:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt so Kawami 2 is worth 13 bucks, right?
[3:55:24] <%brachydios777> OH NO
[3:55:26] <seaechiowai> WutFace
[3:55:36] <+AutechreTwinAphex> it is cool that the characters are all 30+ - finally a JRPG with an all-mature cast
[3:55:36] <%tumzzfestival> weaponized dong hang
[3:55:37] <thelonechris> I'd be terrified too
[3:55:42] <%Sausious> kiwami 2 is on xbox gamepass, jsyk
[3:55:46] <xxshadowxx416> I think kawami 2 on xbox game pass
[3:55:53] <%HitchhikingThrough> should probably beat yakuza 0 first
[3:55:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Black Friday PSN Sale
[3:55:57] <%brachydios777> Yakuza is great
[3:55:58] <%Sausious> so is kiwami 1 and 0

[3:56:05] <+CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt worst Yakuza game, besides Dead Souls?

[3:56:23] <%sumrand0> @fstsergeant8595 i got nothing against consoles I just finally escaped the console trap and after just getting into PC gaming I hate the idea of having exclusives still not getting PC ports at any point since I never wanna go back to consoles
[3:56:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Judgment is 20 on PSN and Xbox Black Friday
[3:56:24] <%Xelhesia> YOU'RE CLOSE TO THE END NOW PAT
[3:56:26] <%Minicow1> Kiwami 2 is also on this month's humble choice
[3:56:33] <PanicSwytch> Amazon has Nioh 2 for $10
[3:56:39] <+AutechreTwinAphex> Judgement doesn't run at 60fps on PS5 right?
[3:56:47] <%sumrand0> I've got nothing against console players I meant to say.
[3:56:55] <+AutechreTwinAphex> oh man - Nioh 2 is a steal
[3:56:58] <%BoxNavy> hes sick of you jermaPluto
[3:57:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @HitchhikingThrough useless because PSN, or because PC or because digital?
[3:57:06] <xxshadowxx416> kawami 2 on pc game pass
[3:57:09] <+CapnClassix> Remastered Collection on PS4 gonna be $25 at Best Buy, starting 11/22
[3:57:13] <%thegreatsun> Food seeking is vital to his survival
[3:57:23] <FstSergeant8595> @sumrand0 I have a friend who bought a $3000 PC and then a year later his psu died. Instead of buying a new psu he bought an xbox one and its all he plays. I truly dont understand him at all.
[3:57:29] <whimsicallifestyle> pupy!
[3:57:38] <akitanito> finally
[3:57:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @AutechreTwinAphex Nioh 2 is a steal... BUT Nioh Collection for PS5 is next year with EVERYTHING
[3:57:42] <huskarl_zap> A DEGENERATE POPPED OUT
[3:57:42] <highfivesquash> I should market dog energy drinks and dog energy snacks
[3:57:43] <+kamikazekripple> can you still summon the crayfish @PatStaresAt
[3:57:45] <BurdRightsActivist> DID HE JUST TURN INTO DOC BROWN?
[3:57:45] <thelonechris> monkaS

[3:57:48] <NeroInfinite> DEGENRATE

[3:57:57] <%AngryAsian5> WHAT?
[3:57:58] <st_jimmy456> cosplay bait
[3:58:00] <+murderof_crows> THE FURY!!
[3:58:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> So, is this guy real?
[3:58:09] <NeroInfinite> YOu foughtone of tese before
[3:58:10] <UnlimitedBick> @heart_ablaze yes
[3:58:12] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @ShinobiPhoenix that's true - but you won't get it for $10 - and I think there is a free upgrade path
[3:58:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Because the last mimic was.
[3:58:15] <+xeros720> pat, normally you wouldn't have lightning right now
[3:58:16] <huskarl_zap> oh end game weapons
[3:58:17] <%tumzzfestival> He's defending?
[3:58:17] <%BaybeeBat> hes weak to electric
[3:58:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The party recognized that it happened.
[3:58:28] <+AutechreTwinAphex> Nioh 2 already runs at 4K 60fps right now on PS5 though with the Variable Movie Mode
[3:58:30] <%Sausious> fast boy
[3:58:31] <%BoxNavy> 🌭 🌭
[3:58:36] <+tigerfang86> HOT
[3:58:40] <Gorgs7> Dnd Legendary actions up in here
[3:58:41] <ExpressNode> That girl sounds like Makoto
[3:58:41] <haisho> damn he hits hard
[3:58:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Time travel.
[3:58:43] <MasterTonberry23> Flash kick
[3:58:45] <%sumrand0> @fstsergeant8595 WOW yeah.....that's......unreal. I enjoyed my One X it did have better framerates but it's nothing compared to PC especially because of all the customization you can do to optimize game performance on PC
[3:58:45] <%HitchhikingThrough> note: KIWAMI STILL MEANS EXTREME
[3:58:52] <heart_ablaze> why tf is this sequence so long?
[3:58:52] <%brachydios777> SWEET
[3:58:52] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[3:59:08] <%tumzzfestival> CRABBY SENTINEL
[3:59:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Can I skip Kiwami 1 and go right away to 2? I played 0
[3:59:13] <UnlimitedBick> @heart_ablaze apparently, this will be explained
[3:59:15] <huskarl_zap> oh noes crabby sentinal
[3:59:26] <%brachydios777> @xerosigmaprime NOPE
[3:59:30] <%OfficerMods> SPONGE BOB ME BOY
[3:59:30] <Thalchampz> @heart_ablaze midgame big dungeon, normal for jrpgs
[3:59:33] <heart_ablaze> @unlimitedbick ok?
[3:59:33] <v00mie> @xerosigmaprime no
[3:59:35] <%BaybeeBat> the next one up from crabby sentinal is pier reviewer
[3:59:36] <%BoxNavy> this has to be the last encounter
[3:59:38] <+AutechreTwinAphex> Series X does lack a truly next gen looking game like Demon's Souls - stuff like this looks good but it's just a PS4 game running at 60fps
[3:59:41] <FstSergeant8595> @sumrand0 yeah i play too many pc only games to go back at this point
[3:59:53] <%Cozy90> ORA
[3:59:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @AutechreTwinAphex I would have grabbed Nioh 2 as well, but you stilll got to buy the DLC and wait for the PS5 version, but Nioh Collection for PS5 comes out next year with both games and all DLC at a base price
[4:00:02] <ShichiNoBushi> How could you miss that?
[4:00:09] <UnlimitedBick> @heart_ablaze look man, i have no idea, but this is what the chat told me
[4:00:20] <heart_ablaze> @thalchampz oh ok, guess that makes sense
[4:00:28] <+kamikazekripple> should have summoned the crayfish to beat the crab
[4:00:28] <%Huntercd> He died
[4:00:31] <heart_ablaze> sorry
[4:00:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> But isnt Kiwami 1 bad compared to 0? I want to play the good Yakuza games, and I Pat said 2 was great
[4:00:32] <%thegreatsun> huh, all her attack are office stationary based
[4:00:32] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @ShinobiPhoenix yeah and I guess you get the 120fps mode then too, and knowing Team Ninja, they'll make sure it runs at a locked 120fps. Definitely looking forward to it
[4:00:34] <mar_krow> yukiko got better
[4:00:39] <akitanito> Ichiban is truly the real bleach japan
[4:00:51] <%sumrand0> @fstsergeant8595 one word man: MODS hahahaha they literally let you make new games out of old games. even if performance is the same on PS5 vs PC the PC will always have the MOD advantage
[4:00:54] <%Sausious> you have like, endgame gear pat
[4:00:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @AutechreTwinAphex PS3 game, from 2009
[4:00:59] <%Sausious> nothing you find wil lbe good
[4:01:08] <%brachydios777> @xerosigmaprime Kiwami isn’t bad, just not as good as zero
[4:01:08] <%zajoestar> this made me dread any dungeons going forward but thankfully the others aren't really bad
[4:01:21] <heart_ablaze> @unlimitedbick sorry, was just confused
[4:01:22] <thelonechris> This dungeon is long as shit
[4:01:29] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @ShinobiPhoenix in terms of graphics it's night and day
[4:01:39] <%BoxNavy> OH GOD ITS FINALLY OVER
[4:01:49] <UnlimitedBick> @heart_ablaze don't worry, one day they'll be out of this sewer and it'll probably be explained
[4:01:50] <+AutechreTwinAphex> mechanically it's the same 2009 game but graphics, sound and haptic feedback elevates it to a new level
[4:01:54] <%XeroSigmaPrime> So the consensus is dont skip Kiwami 1?
[4:01:58] <FstSergeant8595> @sumrand0 See im one of those weirdos who would rather play Skyrim vanilla than play with any mods just because i always fear my mods are going to break the game or corrupt it
[4:01:58] <%BusterRepukken> Yakuza 7 has a resi evil save room theme

[4:02:41] <+rickelstiltskin> Yes, go for the giant hydraulic metal arm
[4:02:41] <$thomassolorio> better than a truck
[4:02:43] <%Avm01> Thats the worst part to hit.
[4:02:44] <%walternatorz> that is probably the worst place to hit it
[4:02:44] <skyentombment> LOOK HOW FAST IT MOVES
[4:02:45] <%thegreatsun> that dude just sit there, watching this unfold
[4:02:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the consensus seemed to be it's fine to skip Kiwami 1, and definitely normal 1
[4:02:45] <weontheultralightbeam> level 17 😟
[4:02:47] <+razielhex> ORBTIAL BEAM

[4:02:56] <%Chatterbox1991> HITESHI HONGO
[4:02:57] <Slim_Lipid> Is this more or less impressive than fighting a tiger solo 🤔
[4:02:58] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @Garthunox I think the game is very interesting, definitely the most interested I have been in a Yakuza game so far, but the dungeon here does seem boring and too long
[4:03:01] <UnlimitedBick> FUCKING ORBITAL LASER

[4:05:57] <%sumrand0> OH NO NO SUN TO PRAISE!
[4:05:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I will say Kiwami 1 is ONLY 6 bucks if one just wants it. Song of Life is only 8 bucks, so that tells you how people feel about them

[4:12:15] <huskarl_zap> soap on a rope

[4:12:21] <+tigerfang86> we saved Yokohama
[4:12:21] <%TheMattman1313> Nicely done Ichiban the HERO
[4:12:22] <%sumrand0> gotta give the Yakuza credit though, they lack firepower but make up for it with style: America shooters usually just wear jeans & a t-shirt
[4:12:24] <%AtlasMcCoy> Yea but fuck nonomiya tho

[4:15:13] <+RetartJack> Party Member 5 was sent to Salty Bet. barbToxic
[4:15:15] <hassanico2> Eri is too cool to be relegated to Chrono Cross
[4:15:18] <+tigerfang86> just assume eri is just in the background of every cutscene
[4:15:20] <+tigerfang86> in stealth
[4:15:20] <akitanito> damnit hololive sports fes is starting
[4:15:23] <%TheMattman1313> She's holding back the invisible hand of the free market from interferring with the story
[4:15:25] <Sunstalker> It's like Phoebe's twin sister, ursuala from Friends DansGame
[4:15:30] <+murderof_crows> Banished to the optional party memeber role
[4:15:40] <+Wiseblood_79> She's always just off camera, and she's shy

[4:15:52] <dinnydanny777> Wait a Hi Frequency Ruler LUL
[4:15:53] <+preppyposs> yeah it sucks but this is crime thriller yakuza not a final fantasy 7 where optional party members get some extra scenes
[4:16:00] <UnlimitedBick> She's in every scene guys, she's the ninja
[4:16:00] <Meekest> I know this is a gang war but who's hungry
[4:16:00] <xbb1024> High Frequency Ruler
[4:16:05] <ABakedDemon> TASTY

[4:21:43] <Guardiansaiyan> I also want more Yakuza if no FF 12
[4:22:17] <+RetartJack> Quick question: why does Anime Peach look like Miss Fortune from League of Legends? And why does Anime Pat look like someone I'd actually want to hang out with? barbToxic
[4:22:40] <%GalacticaPhanto> @guardiansaiyan Honestly with how long it's been since he played 12 he'd have to start from the beginning to really get it going
[4:23:03] <Noogiez> both, both is good.
[4:23:06] <seaechiowai> @retartjack cuz some artists only draw attractive figures
[4:23:25] <+RetartJack> That's.....fair enough. pooSwag
[4:23:28] <%BoxNavy> i would rather hang out with current pat. i would love to have someone who looks like a scary backwoods crazy guy as a friend
[4:23:46] <seaechiowai> but pat would probably look like that if he loses some weight tbf
[4:23:51] <ExpressNode> I finished ff12 and I still don't know what the story of that game was
[4:23:57] <Guardiansaiyan> @GalacticaPhanto aw...and I have finished the streams he did of it so far and he stopped in 2017

[4:36:45] <+hornydino_> that seems... balanced?
[4:36:46] <+StrifeZubia> IT'S JUST FREE
[4:36:47] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Did you know the Cinders mod added guns
[4:36:47] <Srthunda> I thought people last stream said it was trash
[4:36:48] <+Jimboq> LUL
[4:36:50] <rbakervv> man, it uses up so little mana
[4:36:50] <+dingobroyt> @machshop yeah that makes sense
[4:36:58] <%Aeogard> 428 MonkaS
[4:36:58] <+tr1ps_ax1om> oh what the hell. you are overpowered
[4:37:01] <%XzileGaming> ok oroboro.
[4:37:02] <gslayer14> wizord OP
[4:37:03] <+tr1ps_ax1om> frickin nerd
[4:37:05] <+RetartJack> So here's the good news @PatStaresAt You've actually got magic! Which means you're in a better position to kill Old King Doran than the last streamer I watched that played this. pooSwag
[4:37:08] <%GalacticaPhanto> dont dogs lick stuff when they feel anxious? mine does it when he gets nervous or anxious
[4:37:08] <%Laecerelius> Oooooooh
[4:37:12] <%Caped_Eggy> Glass cannon
[4:37:19] <+dingobroyt> Pat: I could play the game and do sword shit, do hard mode....
[4:37:33] <+dingobroyt> Pat: NAH FUCK THAT GUUUUUN!
[4:37:35] <%Nomenanza> here comes the hypermode
[4:37:42] <%Aeogard> @RetartJack if you dont hit Doran 10000 times to kill him it's not a real kill
[4:37:54] <+Chewygamer> So I did some grinding off stream
[4:37:57] <%patriotrenegade> bulldogs constantly lick their nose because their nose gets very dry
[4:38:00] <%XeroSigmaPrime> FUCK, now I need to decide between MAx or PAt streams
[4:38:05] <%machshop> SWAMP TIME
[4:38:06] <mastertwin2> YEAH SWAMP TIME
[4:38:11] <%patriotrenegade> DO IT

[4:38:14] <%Aeogard> BEST LEVEL TIME
[4:38:14] <Visorak6> TOXIC

[4:38:16] <%Monkeyweed21> NOW FOR THE SHIT HOLE
[4:38:18] <%Ynkubus_> Misery loves company
[4:38:20] <pive123456> Is pat a rat?
[4:38:21] <%Laecerelius> Time for da required swamp level
[4:38:22] <oozebear> time for FILTH
[4:38:23] <%Maruko19> poopoo land
[4:38:26] <OOPScrublord> new face ye?
[4:38:26] <+twohitgood> valley of defilement looks awesome.
[4:38:44] <rosemon5001> will you be picking up the penetrator set up on your own time? @PatStaresAt
[4:38:52] <+dingobroyt> I need a smoke JFC
[4:38:52] <pive123456> @patstaresat Pat I love you please stop eating my cheese
[4:38:54] <+RetartJack> @Aeogard yeah, the only hope for the other streamer I watched that tried to take him on was the Fall-Damage-Cheese-Strat. He had the right weapons, but was too stubborn to do it. So yeah: he was boned because he had absolutely NO magic.
[4:38:59] <+tr1ps_ax1om> yeah
[4:39:11] <+Jimboq> valley of defilement tourism
[4:39:12] <+twohitgood> bottom level of valley looks so cool.
[4:39:16] <%patriotrenegade> Ah, Black Gulch, I know it well
[4:39:18] <+dingobroyt> he just started playing and I... I have an intense feeling of dread
[4:39:19] <gslayer14> hey look it's the valley of regular framerate
[4:39:25] <pive123456> @tr1ps_ax1om Can u tell Pat to stop eating my cheese at night
[4:39:27] <rosemon5001> Shit in HIGH DEFINITION LUL
[4:39:35] <RyuuAoi> Did Pat put the controller on his dick yet?
[4:39:36] <+dingobroyt> Nice 3rd person shooter bud
[4:39:38] <highfivesquash> roll down a hill and die
[4:39:39] <+zeitgeist134> look at all that shit and piss
[4:39:41] <%Aeogard> @RetartJack i was replaying it the other day on ps3 and hitting Doran for like 10 per hit was pretty fun, took like 20 mins
[4:39:49] <+RetartJack> @Aeogard Dude was trying the Plague the Old King to death........ feenFail
[4:40:06] <%patriotrenegade> tbh this looks like something youd find at the bottom of one of those chasms in the shitter Chalice Dungeons
[4:40:06] <%Order_of_Mystery> @PatStaresAt will you be playing Miles Morales on stream? That game looks legit, yo.
[4:40:09] <OOPScrublord> blightown but worse
[4:40:11] <%Nomenanza> I like how the noise filter in the original was re-envisioned as the rain
[4:40:12] <+Jimboq> this place is pure filth
[4:40:15] <FlamingoJazz> does what nintendon't
[4:40:28] <Mr_Strut> It's a poison level alright
[4:40:30] <Vaun0x> but with an actual framerate this time
[4:40:31] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt The Patented FROMSOFT Poisonous Shithole level!
[4:40:33] <%Aeogard> pog arrow
[4:40:35] <+trekkie11041> still the coolest poison area designwise
[4:40:35] <%machshop> parts of bloodborne tho
[4:40:40] <Mr_Strut> Worse than Amana?
[4:40:41] <+xeros720> literal piles of shit
[4:40:42] <RyuuAoi> I got Dork Souls on the Switch. Is that okay?
[4:40:46] <Visorak6> People live here btw
[4:40:47] <+Arizon1317> Is he doing a DEX build?
[4:40:47] <%Aeogard> i love how from soft just made demon's souls 5x over
[4:40:58] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[4:40:58] <rosemon5001> shittiest area literally since the walls are crusted by shit
[4:41:00] <%Nomenanza> never since DeS has there ever been a dead baby pit in Fromsoft games.
[4:41:04] <%Monkeyweed21> why is Miyazaki obssessed with poison swamps?
[4:41:04] <+SinisterBroccoli> Valley of defilement is my favorite zone in the game I fucking love it so much
[4:41:12] <Srthunda> cool fire physic
[4:41:17] <boardscanada> who needs raytracing with lighting like this
[4:41:28] <%Order_of_Mystery> fucky wucky, wuw
[4:41:35] <Noogiez> soooo... florida
[4:41:37] <Noogiez> jk
[4:41:38] <+RetartJack> @PatStaresAt You wanna talk about the grime-iest place ever in a Souls game? Keep going down and the walls will literally be shitting slugs. Doesn't get much grimier than that. feenEw
[4:41:38] <RyuuAoi> LORE
[4:41:41] <%Aeogard> The gutter 2.0
[4:41:43] <%Nomenanza> garbage being also living things
[4:41:44] <%Aeogard> wait...
[4:41:46] <Slim_Lipid> and BlightTown LUL
[4:41:47] <Admiral_PopnFresh> And Blighttown,
[4:41:47] <+dingobroyt> Sounds like it's Wales
[4:41:50] <willsin4fun> by garbage they mean babies
[4:41:51] <%AzureGale> A trash heap
[4:41:52] <+eanscrale> It's basically a medieval slum
[4:41:54] <RyuuAoi> More like Detroit.
[4:42:02] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt I mean tomb of the giants had the skeletons of aborted children in it, so id argue thats worse
[4:42:07] <Noogiez> haha
[4:42:11] <%Huntercd> Aborted fetuses
[4:42:32] <%Aeogard> i love how fast 5-1 can be if you just know where to fall to get to the boss
[4:42:36] <%Nomenanza> Blighttown felt more like it was there anyway with the swamp and all, while Valley always felt as if it was fucked to be like that by the human hands.
[4:42:52] <%Huntercd> How many proms did it take to fill up this place?
[4:42:52] <RyuuAoi> That was fucked
[4:43:05] <+dingobroyt> Pat with the no scopes
[4:43:15] <%logoth_> logoth_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Quick work RE: World Tendency Online. I killed two bosses in Bole., then killed a dragon and got pure white. Did my pure white events right away and then called it. Later I went to play again and I lost my pure white tendency. This all happened online.
[4:43:18] <boardscanada> you get a real sense of place now - as if the environment is real
[4:43:22] <Admiral_PopnFresh> How long would real Pat last in this Valley?
[4:43:40] <+xeros720> there's a real feeling of danger
[4:43:54] <gslayer14> anxiety inducement?
[4:43:58] <RyuuAoi> And now Fromsoft will NEVER EVER make another game NEVER EVER again.
[4:44:03] <%Aeogard> big agree pat, a lot of environments feel natural and realistic and you're just somehow making your way through them
[4:44:04] <%Nomenanza> god that climb in Anor Londo almost felt un-intended
[4:44:07] <+dingobroyt> The broken window?
[4:44:11] <%Daniel_Is_I> Up the parapet, in through a broken window, and across the rafters.
[4:44:13] <+xeros720> yeah, anxiety inducement is good
[4:44:16] <%Aeogard> EXCEPT FOR DS2 RUBBLE BLOCKING YOU
[4:44:22] <eros104> Level Desing is just random?
[4:44:22] <%patriotrenegade> And yet Gwyndolyn put archers there
[4:44:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @RyuuAoi we have to kill GRRM
[4:44:31] <%logoth_> You're gonna dead
[4:44:34] <+trekkie11041> im really curious to see what the leechmonger looks like
[4:44:48] <+falineth> falineth subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[4:44:49] <rosemon5001> also most important fack the walls are covered by shit
[4:44:51] <+xeros720> solaire got through there first, so that makes sense
[4:44:56] <%DedlokPM> We're gonna die? doodWAT
[4:45:02] <%greasypete00> hullo pat
[4:45:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> Magic seems busted in this game
[4:45:12] <%greasypete00> and chat
[4:45:12] <%Alazull> @patstaresat they are really good at designing in a way that says you are not supposed to be here
[4:45:13] <+dingobroyt> I mean, if you sniping who cares
[4:45:19] <redial_nick> another prediction?
[4:45:37] <RyuuAoi> Magic for COWARDS
[4:45:45] <PettyFunk> I feel profoundly unwelcome all the time in my daily life
[4:45:47] <+SinisterBroccoli> Not playing on Fractured mode?
[4:45:49] <islandoasis> where are we
[4:45:55] <islandoasis> valley of definment?>
[4:45:56] <%YakumoYomi> That's every Souls game, though
[4:46:00] <eros104> Its Fun?
[4:46:20] <RyuuAoi> New Pat. New build
[4:46:22] <%Aeogard> magic builds are fun for your like 2-5th playthroughs
[4:46:24] <%hax_metatron> hax_metatron subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[4:46:24] <%patriotrenegade> because its busted thats why
[4:46:26] <redrins> is it okay to second chance newbies in old monk?
[4:46:26] <collind99> Anyone got tips for a mage Knight build
[4:46:35] <+twohitgood> magic is almost as strong as in cinders.
[4:46:36] <%hax_metatron> Did he just start DeS
[4:46:39] <boardscanada> these are Boletaria's shanty towns?
[4:46:43] <islandoasis> meat cleaver build
[4:46:45] <eros104> Magic is Busted, and thas Fun.
[4:46:46] <%Order_of_Mystery> Magic builds in From games are fun. Especially in Bloodborne. bigjoe3FLEX1 bigjoe3JOEYRAGE bigjoe3FLEX2
[4:46:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> Dude, making the AI all fold in Yakuza poker by save-scumming an all-in strategy feels so good.
[4:46:53] <+RetartJack> @PatStaresAt Quick question: who's the best Souls Level Up waifu? Maiden In Black, Lady Maria Doll, or Keeper of Flame? barbToxic
[4:47:04] <+McBubbles07> same @PettyFunk
[4:47:05] <%Alazull> these arr boletaria's waste dumps
[4:47:13] <%Xelhesia> AGREED
[4:47:14] <%Daniel_Is_I> But bonfire-chan
[4:47:15] <CrimsonFox777> BONFIRE-CHAN
[4:47:17] <PlatinumWyvern> bonfire-chan pvpWhy
[4:47:18] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Priscilla
[4:47:19] <+xeros720> depends on how much you like feet
[4:47:22] <mastertwin2> Bonfire-chan is always best
[4:47:23] <islandoasis> this is boletaria's poop chutes
[4:47:25] <%Order_of_Mystery> not bonfire-chan? how dare you, Pat!!!
[4:47:25] <%Aeogard> maiden in black has bare feet, she wins
[4:47:27] <+RetartJack> Fare enough. pooSwag
[4:47:28] <thelonechris> Amygdala
[4:47:32] <Mr_Strut> The doll is pretty great
[4:47:34] <%T_Sasquatch> seeker seek seek lest
[4:47:40] <+paladinstarbuster> The doll aint got shit on emerald herald
[4:47:43] <icantstopthescreams> This is an actual shit pit
[4:47:43] <islandoasis> patches is best waifu
[4:47:45] <Jmann1892> Firekeeper is best girl
[4:47:49] <%Daniel_Is_I> I do like the Emerald Herald
[4:47:52] <%XeroSigmaPrime> But man, the OG story for Emerald Herald was EPIC
[4:47:58] <+Wessuri> Hi pat, it's great to hear ya
[4:48:01] <%Emperor_Machinus> What about the emerald herald?
[4:48:10] <+Jimboq> is that poop on the wall
[4:48:12] <%superc37> emerald heralds the blandest one tho
[4:48:13] <+vaderxyz1970> "Good Hunter" makes me chub
[4:48:24] <+SinisterBroccoli> @PatStaresAt Did you pay any attention to the secret door shenanigans?
[4:48:28] <islandoasis> crescent falchion?
[4:48:29] <%T_Sasquatch> its weird i dont give a shit about the chick in ds3 but I get legit sad when i had 0 insight in bloodborne
[4:48:30] <+twohitgood> caca?
[4:48:32] <%Aeogard> Emerald herald is actually my favorite overall in terms of design and stuff, but maiden still wins out for originality
[4:48:37] <PanicSwytch> Next gen poop
[4:48:47] <PettyFunk> Impressive dietary fiber to achieve such fecal adhesion
[4:48:52] <%superc37> emerald herald is literally just a discount maiden in black
[4:49:09] <%coreyyotto> can you rebind?
[4:49:15] <redrins> probably yeah
[4:49:18] <%Order_of_Mystery> wait, fractured mode turns your character into a leftie?
[4:49:21] <TheDarkRemRem99> hey pat just tuning in you liking the remake so far?
[4:49:25] <%T_Sasquatch> i only like emerald herald because she's a redhead
[4:49:28] <%hax_metatron> They also flip the levels @patstaresat
[4:49:29] <%patriotrenegade> I mourn the the loss of Priscilla as our level-up waifu in DaS @PatStaresAt
[4:49:31] <+twohitgood> you should be able to. no reason why not. fractured mode can be reversed.
[4:49:33] <%hax_metatron> That’s what makes it hard
[4:49:37] <st_jimmy456> can't shoot straight down lol
[4:49:38] <%Aeogard> maiden in black design looks nicer in ps3 vs ps5 imo
[4:49:41] <islandoasis> that doesnt really sound fun
[4:49:45] <%logoth_> That sounds lame
[4:49:45] <%hax_metatron> You can always swap between fractured mode and back. You’re not locked in
[4:49:50] <%hax_metatron> It’s the statue in Nexus
[4:49:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> 3rd party controller with invertable X-Axis?
[4:49:52] <$Afterman_> boo i want more left handed representation
[4:49:53] <%Nomenanza> it's Twilight Princess's mirror mode
[4:49:56] <%Daniel_Is_I> It doesn't reverse the controls though, right?
[4:49:57] <%XeroSigmaPrime> The OG story for Emerald Herald had it so you time traveled and know her both as a child and an adult
[4:49:59] <boardscanada> nah I liked that Dark Souls had no waifu levelup - it felt more like a real journey going from bonfire to bonfire
[4:50:02] <PettyFunk> That Twilight Princess kinda L/R relearning
[4:50:08] <+RetartJack> Got a question for chat: Sister Friede and Lady Maria get in a fright....who wins? barbToxic
[4:50:18] <+hellishfurball2> Why u no pankek?
[4:50:24] <RyuuAoi> Sheild?
[4:50:24] <%ChaosAethr> did I miss boss?
[4:50:25] <+twohitgood> fractured mode is playing twilight princess on GC as opposed to on Wii.
[4:50:30] <RyuuAoi> Shield?
[4:50:31] <%Order_of_Mystery> Lady Maria hands down.
[4:50:34] <%hax_metatron> You’re not locked into fractured mode. It’s a swap at the statue in Nexus
[4:50:37] <+vaderxyz1970> Lady Maria hand down
[4:50:43] <Meekest> idk try it
[4:50:46] <rosemon5001> @PatStaresAt do you know what game got an update recently? Exit the gungeon.Didnt know until i saw the ps add for it on youtube
[4:50:46] <PettyFunk> @RetartJack Lady Maria seems to have more raw power but I feel like Friede has the tactical edge
[4:50:49] <%SomeSageAdvice> Lady Maria has fire
[4:50:51] <%shurtal> No cling ring?
[4:50:53] <islandoasis> shorttrap
[4:50:54] <%superc37> that being said im not a huge fan of the armor being the only set in the entire souls series locked behind ng+
[4:50:59] <Meekest> Thats A LOT of blood down there
[4:50:59] <eros104> To far
[4:51:05] <Fefe41> You can jump it
[4:51:13] <ActingKing42> @superc37 which set?
[4:51:19] <RyuuAoi> Lots of blood down below.
[4:51:19] <%hax_metatron> That’s the only way to get it LUL
[4:51:25] <%T_Sasquatch> does this ame have no torches ??
[4:51:34] <rosemon5001> do you have a filter on or no?
[4:51:37] <%superc37> @actingking42 the set behind the secret door
[4:51:41] <%hax_metatron> You can survive that fall
[4:51:46] <ActingKing42> ahh
[4:51:58] <alwayspronking> woof, very rough
[4:52:08] <%ChaosAethr> 10-15 frames as well
[4:52:08] <gslayer14> member when you exclaimed how little fall damage this game had 2 sessions ago pat?
[4:52:08] <%Aeogard> 5-2 is so fucking rough on ps3, you literally cant see anything
[4:52:12] <%bread_assassin> Anyone in chat try a Blueblood Sword build? I'm shooting for one myself but rushing 5-3 straight out of the gates is a pain in the ass.
[4:52:16] <%tusk102> just got off work we in abortion swamp town?
[4:52:16] <%superc37> the only way to get is by getting to at least ng+2
[4:52:21] <%Aeogard> but imo it kinda lends to it being so imposing
[4:52:28] <RyuuAoi> Check those corners!
[4:52:40] <+xeros720> i hope that second message says, "now behind"
[4:52:42] <%Aeogard> aw yeah big succ monsters
[4:52:42] <%Nomenanza> @bread_assassin you mean the glitch one where you accumulate like 10k luck stat and one shot bosses or a normal one?
[4:52:47] <+natedrago> like fish in a barrel
[4:52:48] <Aydarkzero> nice
[4:52:57] <+twohitgood> time to make a fatal dagger
[4:53:00] <islandoasis> cut the bridge
[4:53:02] <+RetartJack> Gotta say my personal loyalty does lie with Lady Maria....her phase changes are VERY strong. Not gonna lie, though...Sister Friede's phase changes are right up there. Honestly it's just me liking BB more...but god DAYUM the Sister Friede fight is frickin' awesome. pooSwag
[4:53:04] <zephyr_zx> lucky drop
[4:53:16] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt MAx got a pure bladestone off a black katana skeleton
[4:53:20] <%Fidranth> Fidranth subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! Oh right, the Souls. The souls of the demon, The souls specifically from the demon. Demon's Souls.
[4:53:34] <Aydarkzero> that's really lucky
[4:53:35] <+xeros720> that's where you get those, irrc
[4:53:41] <%Nomenanza> saint set does make sense being here
[4:53:43] <%patriotrenegade> 1 in 10000 chance
[4:53:46] <%bread_assassin> @Nomenanza Just your regular not-gonna-get-patched build.
[4:53:51] <icantstopthescreams> This place just looks like swamp ass personified
[4:53:53] <%Order_of_Mystery> are pure bladestones still a motherfucker to get?
[4:53:57] <Aydarkzero> Saint is a starter class right?
[4:53:57] <%Aeogard> @PatStaresAt I tried finishing off the PS3 DeS trophies the other day and literally went through 3 playthroughs before giving up trying to get a single Pure Darkmoonstone.
[4:53:59] <+xeros720> wow, that's even worse than i remember, who are you supposed to farm?
[4:54:01] <%hax_metatron> They improved the pure blade stone rate. Devs confirmed its
[4:54:04] <Aydarkzero> fren
[4:54:17] <%greasypete00> filthy
[4:54:18] <%patriotrenegade> she doesnt look very dirty
[4:54:19] <Aydarkzero> @Aeogard don't give up Skeleton
[4:54:25] <%hax_metatron> They improved pure blade stone rate. Devs confirmed it.
[4:54:27] <%XeroSigmaPrime> You can feed a child demon souls?! WTF
[4:54:28] <+twohitgood> good job of making her look more dire. in the original, she just looks kinda mean.
[4:54:30] <Esperflame> A child hungry for souls doesn't sound good.
[4:54:34] <%Nomenanza> it is STILL so weird seeing DeS characters' mouths move.
[4:54:38] <PettyFunk> @PatStaresAt Would it be better to tweet @ or DM you photos of my cat
[4:54:46] <FlamingoJazz> warse
[4:54:49] <%Aeogard> even pure bladestone isnt as bad as darkmoonstone in DeS Ps3
[4:54:49] <wolverinewaswrong> in the old game i thought she was a zombie
[4:55:00] <PettyFunk> <3
[4:55:01] <%greasypete00> icky, stinky, gross, goopy, poopy, nasty, DISGUSTANG woman
[4:55:10] <wolverinewaswrong> squid headed knight
[4:55:20] <Aydarkzero> oh man i love this
[4:55:26] <%Aeogard> you can at least farm out bladestone, you literally get 3, maybe 6 chances /per playthrough/ to get a Pure Darkmoonstone
[4:55:28] <Meekest> Shes just Some Lady

[4:56:00] <%patriotrenegade> Dont contract GLAUCOMA
[4:56:05] <+SinisterBroccoli> I think the new ost is great, it's just different
[4:56:09] <+scrumbotime> Spell of Gun
[4:56:10] <+twohitgood> spell of gun.
[4:56:13] <%Order_of_Mystery> so how did astrea become a demon?
[4:56:15] <+idyota> rats, rats, we're the rats
[4:56:17] <%hax_metatron> Yeah they ruined the OST with dynamic nonsense. The repetitiveness was meditative
[4:56:18] <+twohitgood> jinx
[4:56:21] <+RetartJack> Spam that to kill Old King Doran. barbToxic
[4:56:24] <Aydarkzero> the new theme isn't hers anymore it's Vinlands now
[4:56:26] <%Nomenanza> Can't wait for dead fetuses pool
[4:56:27] <%Emperor_Machinus> Where is the big rat that makes all the rules?
[4:56:31] <%patriotrenegade> I CAST GUN
[4:56:33] <%Aeogard> I think the new ost definitely doesn't have a lot of the appeal of the original imo, but it's not /awful/
[4:56:40] <+MeatBomb> Firing gun into mosh pit seems a bit much.
[4:56:47] <%hax_metatron> Get ready for tough enemy LUL
[4:56:50] <+twohitgood> big boi
[4:56:51] <Esperflame> @Order_of_Mystery Technically, the character you play is a demon too.
[4:56:52] <Aydarkzero> the big one monkaS
[4:57:00] <%patriotrenegade> MAJOR asshole
[4:57:01] <islandoasis> thats alot of casts for what seems like little mp
[4:57:01] <%Order_of_Mystery> is that the big chungus?
[4:57:02] <+AnbeiH> @Nomenanza out seeing what sort of trouble he can get himself into

[4:57:22] <Dannzzyy> Man I wanna get this game already.
[4:57:25] <Aydarkzero> biggest of chungus share your secrets
[4:57:25] <islandoasis> "friend ahead"
[4:57:33] <%hax_metatron> LUL
[4:57:36] <rosemon5001> goblin slayer missed some goblins we see
[4:57:37] <$Afterman_> pat's all "while you studied the blade i studied the tome"
[4:57:37] <%Taisuru> Pat, you're the only large chungus for me
[4:57:39] <+TheBitingIrish> The 'ChungEST', if you will
[4:57:49] <%Aeogard> Slayer of Chungus
[4:57:56] <%patriotrenegade> those torches are just impaled in that guy, huh
[4:58:11] <islandoasis> the Woolie enemies
[4:58:19] <%Order_of_Mystery> @Esperflame oh? is that because your character dies?
[4:58:22] <%Aeogard> how does everyone feel about the UI and icon redesigns
[4:58:37] <%Nomenanza> oh that's great being able to customize each half of the touchpad
[4:58:43] <%DedlokPM> doodYelp doodYelp

[4:58:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Ok Gold 3
[4:58:57] <%Order_of_Mystery> cute little poo garden
[4:59:12] <%Aeogard> black poo resin
[4:59:20] <Esperflame> @Order_of_Mystery Using the Soul arts is the source of all things demons. It's why if you Recuse Yurt and let him come back to the Nexus he murders everyone then tries to kill you. He wants to kill all demons.
[4:59:26] <%Nomenanza> of course they added puss to the already gross whatever those are
[4:59:27] <valriot> ORBS
[4:59:43] <%patriotrenegade> i like that the just disappear, gj Bluepoint
[4:59:54] <XeroSigmaPrime> Man this is really setting off my Scat fetish, I need this game XD
[4:59:59] <$Afterman_> @Nomenanza i think you mean pus LOL
[5:00:11] <+RetartJack> Dude, seriously.....having magic poke in this game is sooooooo fucking strong!
[5:00:16] <%tusk102> @patriotrenegade on one hand thats great but also i miss the goofy ragdoll physics
[5:00:22] <Dannzzyy> Hopefully cyberpunk will cure my ps5 blues.
[5:00:27] <%Nomenanza> @Afterman_ bitterSmug I meant both of those things bitterSmug
[5:00:28] <$Afterman_> @XeroSigmaPrime wtfff
[5:00:32] <%promessav2> are pyromancies sorceries in this game?
[5:00:40] <+RetartJack> zo
[5:00:43] <%patriotrenegade> ah kos
[5:00:44] <$Afterman_> @Nomenanza my man Kappa
[5:00:47] <%Aeogard> @promessav2 basically yeah
[5:00:51] <+scrumbotime> the slugs are splurpin'
[5:00:53] <+RetartJack> I've seen some shit with the slugs.....quite literally. feenS
[5:00:53] <+xeros720> in case you forgot how shitty this place is
[5:00:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> some say kosm
[5:00:55] <islandoasis> there arent a pyromancy in des i think
[5:00:56] <%Order_of_Mystery> @Esperflame I never knew that. so everyone else in the nexus is a demon? even Thomas?
[5:00:58] <+trekkie11041> leeches WutFace
[5:01:04] <MonstarGrrrl> slugs are so damn gross
[5:01:05] <%Aeogard> but theyre classified as flame sorceries, not pyromancy
[5:01:06] <+xeros720> yeah, you're here, this first area is pretty short
[5:01:07] <Visorak6> Leechmonger baby
[5:01:18] <+xeros720> because there's a large danger of falling all over
[5:01:18] <%Order_of_Mystery> time to mong some leeches
[5:01:19] <Admiral_PopnFresh> All these guys beat Bloodborne
[5:01:20] <+RetartJack> Leech Monger.....HOOOOOOOOO! feenHappy
[5:01:23] <Dannzzyy> Hug the slug friends
[5:01:29] <%promessav2> man that's strong
[5:01:47] <eros104> U need the Cat Ring
[5:01:51] <%Nomenanza> how come they never brought back climbing
[5:01:55] <%Aeogard> i genuinely appreciate though how the 5-x bosses are kind of pushovers because the zones themselves are the real challenge
[5:02:00] <%tusk102> Man i wish they brought back casting catalysts that were wants instead of big staffs
[5:02:05] <Lynxystem> man the ledge vaulting in this game still trhows me off, since we never got it back, lol
[5:02:06] <%tusk102> wands*
[5:02:09] <%greasypete00> i kinda hope the climb comes back in elden ring, even if its never really used
[5:02:10] <%Nomenanza> aside from it being poorly communicated what you could and couldnt climb
[5:02:10] <$Afterman_> they definitely make the ground look treacherous as fuck. its hard to see what is real ground or not
[5:02:10] <+scrumbotime> I thought that was in game
[5:02:11] <%patriotrenegade> yee
[5:02:13] <@commanderclaw> That was Gief
[5:02:14] <%Xelhesia> YEA
[5:02:17] <valriot> doodWAT
[5:02:20] <Esperflame> @Order_of_Mystery Who knows, but Yurt kills everyone because he assumes everyone there is a demon.
[5:02:20] <+RetartJack> Dude, Pat....you haven't seen shit. I mean, you're ABOUT to see shit if you beat this boss....but yeah, you haven't seen shit. barbToxic
[5:02:32] <+scrumbotime> ohhhhh I thought you were saying Gief did a HUGE INHALE
[5:02:36] <+xeros720> back on the ps3, i remember needing to jack up the brightness to make out the floor in this area
[5:02:36] <Meekest> Thats a lot of blood down there
[5:02:38] <Fefe41> straight off
[5:02:40] <eros104> No
[5:02:41] <%Nomenanza> oh THIS jump
[5:02:41] <islandoasis> yurt's not wrong to assume that
[5:02:44] <%Dutchpotato> only one way to find ouyt
[5:02:44] <rosemon5001> HEAL
[5:02:53] <eros104> U need the cat ring

[5:03:15] <%promessav2> that would have nearly killed you
[5:03:16] <islandoasis> DEAD
[5:03:20] <%promessav2> in ds1 for sure
[5:03:20] <+RetartJack> I REGRET NOTHING!!!!!!! feenR
[5:03:21] <valriot> Fall damage LUL
[5:03:24] <@commanderclaw> DS1 to DS2 was pretty bad
[5:03:25] <%greasypete00> dark souls 1 would absolutely survive
[5:03:28] <%Dutchpotato> yeah fall damage is wild in this game
[5:03:31] <@commanderclaw> I killed myself like 10 times
[5:03:31] <%promessav2> the hit you took would have ednded it
[5:03:36] <%tusk102> @hax_metatron he's at like 80% health
[5:03:37] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Man this game got ALOT right on their FIRST ATTEMPT
[5:03:38] <%Daniel_Is_I> That's the kind of drop DS3 had to say "Take the plunge, you won't die." at
[5:03:41] <%falineth> everyone who uses any form of magic or has levelled has been tainted by demonic power basically
[5:03:43] <%patriotrenegade> CRYSTAL DICKHEAD
[5:03:46] <%hax_metatron> Told you LUL
[5:03:48] <%Nomenanza> So do lizards still just disappear forever if you miss them?
[5:03:49] <Fefe41> Iirc there used to be a haystack there to indicate you can jump onto it
[5:03:59] <+TheBitingIrish> Is this the Blighttown of this game?
[5:04:05] <Lynxystem> man i STARTED with DS2, i was so afraid to drop onto anything when i played DS1 next, lmao
[5:04:11] <%tusk102> @Nomenanza nope they respawn
[5:04:12] <+TheBitingIrish> Jebaited
[5:04:14] <+scrumbotime> FOUL THAT MAN
[5:04:16] <%Order_of_Mystery> that's nothing compares to how poorly ledge vaulting is explained. at least in the remake it forces you to vault in world 0
[5:04:18] <%promessav2> i had to give up on paladin leeroy, can't survive the drop
[5:04:19] <%hax_metatron> @tusk102 Enemies attack you as soon as you drop there. Better to be safe
[5:04:22] <%Nomenanza> @tusk102 thank god
[5:04:36] <d4nsteele> 14 raiders from d4nsteele have joined!

[5:05:19] <islandoasis> well in king's field 4, there was a well you could drop into but it killed you hard. you needed to level up enough to have enough hp to survive it. From Soft's been doing bullshit drops since forever
[5:05:19] <%tusk102> psaSmug psaSmug
[5:05:27] <%Laecerelius> 4-1 also has the regen ring and shield if you're going regen build
[5:05:29] <%Aeogard> i think it makes having different weapons to use a lot easier, especially since weapon damage types matter a lot more
[5:05:36] <+RetartJack> DS2 was just garbage.....they completely fucked the Estus Flask. feenNo

[5:07:24] <%Aeogard> doesnt world tendency only update at nexus??
[5:07:27] <Esperflame> You say magic was nerfed, but Chaos Bed Vestiges is still OP as F if you build for it

[5:07:35] <mil_muertes92> mmmmm cheesy
[5:07:39] <KngJester> bosses dont stand a chance when you pull the strap
[5:07:41] <%patriotrenegade> Freke just sucks, man
[5:07:42] <%promessav2> at least you have to drop into pinwheel so you always take like 50 dmg
[5:07:45] <%tusk102> @Esperflame thats pyromancy not magic
[5:07:53] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat watch out!
[5:07:54] <%falineth> I heard there was a world tendency bar
[5:07:57] <%patriotrenegade> OR he fought like six Mindflayers
[5:08:00] <%Order_of_Mystery> @Order_of_Mystery Lightning spears, and how you cast them (i.e., THROWING them) is the hypest shit ever
[5:08:00] <$Afterman_> he did his best
[5:08:11] <Esperflame> In this game it's just magic tho @tusk102
[5:08:12] <+Wessuri> "Relive the DIFFICULTY"
[5:08:18] <islandoasis> im betting man eater fog gate cheese is still in INTENTIONALLY if this boss was any indication

[5:08:45] <%tusk102> @Esperflame is chaos bed vestiges in this game??? i never actually got a chance to play it
[5:08:53] <+xeros720> big stinky
[5:08:54] <gslayer14> man i'm gone for 5 minute and you've beaten the boss?

[5:09:02] <%Order_of_Mystery> get the broken sword!
[5:09:03] <gslayer14> i miss all the cool parts
[5:09:06] <Fefe41> On PS3 the frames would have dropped to 20 by now
[5:09:10] <+RetartJack> Just a fun reminder: Demon Souls is objectively easier than Dark Souls and/or Bloodborne. Suffice to say: there's a reason the "SoulsBorne" genre didn't start until Dark Souls. Furthermore: there's a reason it was Dark Souls - not Demon Souls - that had the tagline of "You Will Die 1000 Times!"
[5:09:11] <islandoasis> die?
[5:09:13] <%MyNameIsRasus> oh we're in shittown usa
[5:09:13] <thelonechris> Umbasa

[5:09:35] <CyborgAV> It's so much better holy shit
[5:09:36] <+xeros720> nice amount of frames
[5:09:38] <%Aeogard> THE CEILING
[5:09:41] <Lynxystem> WOOOOOOOW
[5:09:43] <Visorak6> You couldnt see SHIT in 5-2 before
[5:09:47] <%bevyrage> imagine if the PS5 still chunked

[5:09:53] <%saadi90> Sure is!
[5:09:55] <Lynxystem> you can see more than 10 feet away, holy shit
[5:10:07] <Fefe41> Back then we use the glows of items to know where to go
[5:10:08] <+A_grilled_cheese_sandwich> A_grilled_cheese_sandwich subscribed with Prime. 
[5:10:08] <Onamar> The framerate was awful too
[5:10:11] <%saadi90> Frame rate
[5:10:15] <%Aeogard> you can literally only see like 15 feet in front of you in 5-2
[5:10:15] <CyborgAV> You can't see 10 feet in front of you it's crazy
[5:10:16] <%Nomenanza> not only because it was dark but also because of the fullscreen filter

[5:10:20] <mastertwin2> there was like a morrowind-level fog over everything
[5:10:21] <%Aeogard> ps3**
[5:10:22] <Onamar> Maiden astrea legit almost killed my PS3, had to reboot it to get the game to stop chugging even when I left
[5:10:24] <+twohitgood> valley of deframerate
[5:10:30] <Lynxystem> that blood fog was so THICC in the original
[5:10:45] <+RetartJack> PS5: if you're not playing it on 60 FPS Mode, you're doing it wrong. pooSwag
[5:10:46] <%promessav2> the dark souls of framerates
[5:10:49] <%tusk102> @twohitgood !Frame Rate Lost!
[5:10:50] <%furiousfurioso> I pulled up a video and skipped to the middle and a guy was just walking through water towards total darkness
[5:10:53] <islandoasis> we arent getting to mass baby murder?

[5:11:16] <%Laecerelius> This soul is made of farts
[5:11:17] <zephyr_zx> theres a miracle too
[5:11:22] <rjhascancer> YOU CAN GET CURE
[5:11:27] <%Daniel_Is_I> "can be used to purchase the spell Poison Cloud from Sage Freke, or the miracle Cure from Saint Urbain."
[5:11:41] <Esperflame> @PatStaresAt It makes the Cure miracle with Saint Urbain
[5:11:45] <+trekkie11041> you can get the cure miacle
[5:11:53] <+RetartJack> @PatStaresAt Poison Cloud PLUS Plague Of Death makes killing Old King Doran super easy. pooSwag
[5:12:12] <ExpressNode> Does world tendency make the ending matter?
[5:12:15] <%hax_metatron> Plague of GRIPES, you say?
[5:12:27] <Esperflame> @RetartJack killing with poison cloud tho give your darker character tendency
[5:12:44] <%Aeogard> ending is a single choice between 2 at the very end, nothing else
[5:12:54] <CappuccinoGuil> Can you use upgrade mats from storage when you upgrade weapons with Ed in Stonefang Tunnel?
[5:12:58] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt how come in dark souls games you don't sell armor and weapons and stuff? i've been able to get multiple levels worth of souls from dumping all the items i'll never use. is it just goblins or is there another reason?
[5:13:01] <rjhascancer> Did you beat world 1 yet?
[5:13:03] <+RetartJack> @Esperflame Killing him regardless lowers your tendency by 2. barbToxic
[5:13:09] <%Nomenanza> iirc you get a guillotine axe in black 1-1
[5:13:12] <bone_reaper69> @CappuccinoGuil yea
[5:13:17] <+RetartJack> @Esperflame Buuuuuut you get some sweet armor for doing the deed.
[5:13:23] <Esperflame> yeah but doing it with poison makes it workse
[5:13:32] <Esperflame> worse
[5:13:42] <islandoasis> you have balls of steel, dont let them take them from you
[5:13:55] <%Aeogard> glass cannon time
[5:14:03] <Esperflame> I'd go for more HP
[5:14:05] <rjhascancer> vitality always safe bet
[5:14:06] <icantstopthescreams> 40 magic for big damage
[5:14:07] <%Aeogard> you shouldnt be getting hit anyway LUL
[5:14:08] <+megabman> go go glass cannon

[5:14:23] <+RetartJack> @Esperflame I mean if you're going after him, then chances are you don't really care about the tendency shift. :P
[5:14:26] <+SneakyBeaver102> Push 40
[5:14:29] <%hax_metatron> 4-2 and 5-2 as glass cannon good luck LUL
[5:14:38] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt just don't get hit
[5:14:40] <Esperflame> @RetartJack Fair enough :D
[5:14:43] <+twohitgood> make a true glass playthrough and fracture the world every time you die.
[5:14:50] <%Nomenanza> hypermode all the way
[5:14:55] <%Aeogard> if you get the regen items the poison swamp is like, literally a non-issue
[5:15:26] <+SneakyBeaver102> If your good health doesn’t matter Kappa
[5:15:27] <rjhascancer> still rocking the scimitar?
[5:15:28] <Esperflame> I just finished my 125 str build in DS and I hit a black knight with Dragonarmors axe weapon art for just over 1k. Was noice!
[5:15:35] <i_am_therydon> i miss the old scream
[5:15:35] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh hey, we going up to look at the view? That's nice
[5:15:37] <Esperflame> ds3 I mean
[5:15:39] <%tusk102> ! Splattered !
[5:15:41] <%Aeogard> you literally outheal poison with the shield + ring, let alone a regen weapon
[5:15:42] <CappuccinoGuil> OH GOD, HE JUMPED OFF!
[5:15:46] <islandoasis> skim-mi-tar
[5:15:47] <%hax_metatron> DeS tricks you into feeling everything is easy, then before you know it big chungus is pounding you into the poison in 5-2, and you can’t roll, and get destroyed
[5:15:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> why is this game so fucking pretty?
[5:15:48] <+Jaysky> I can't believe you died at spawn shaking my smh my head head
[5:16:04] <%Nomenanza> Not gonna lie, lowkey upset how because of scalpers you can't get PS5 here for a good while unless you want to literally spend as much money as for a used car.
[5:16:04] <%Aeogard> +2 souls Pog
[5:16:07] <bone_reaper69> pat you had like 20 souls
[5:16:18] <RubberFistFight> you mean 1-2?
[5:16:20] <rjhascancer> 1-2 no?
[5:16:21] <+trekkie11041> 1-2 you man
[5:16:22] <%Aeogard> 1-2 you mean
[5:16:23] <icantstopthescreams> Tower knights gonna die like a bitch
[5:16:23] <RubberFistFight> coz 2-1 is stonefang tunnel
[5:16:27] <i_am_therydon> how much damage will you do to dragons pat?
[5:16:32] <RubberFistFight> NO FUCK YOU
[5:16:33] <%hax_metatron> Time for REEEEEEEEEE
[5:16:34] <RubberFistFight> Kappa
[5:16:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> My cat bit my boob last week. Still would die for the fucker <3
[5:16:37] <+Jaysky> 1-2, 2-1, same difference surely
[5:16:40] <+twohitgood> kill the red dragon along the path?
[5:16:44] <%Aeogard> its literally mario levels come on
[5:16:53] <Esperflame> @CommanderSqueaks Cause Bluepoint is out to prove their technical know-how on making games. That's 2 remakes they've done now that are just fantastic.
[5:17:01] <%Nomenanza> wouldnt flame spray be more efficient?
[5:17:12] <islandoasis> penis-traitor
[5:17:19] <rjhascancer> @PatStaresAt no shield?
[5:17:24] <Esperflame> the downside of flame spray is it cannot stagger anything
[5:17:29] <RubberFistFight> so how many zones has Pat-Tron 5000 actually defeated?
[5:17:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> I have never seen literal shit look so gorgeous
[5:17:48] <%hax_metatron> You can open it in remake and you broke it Kappa
[5:17:56] <+RetartJack> @Esperflame Hehe, one of my favorite streamers was trying to kill him with a full physical build. His strat was "stab he fuck out of him with the Baby Nail until I inflict Plague!" despite the fact that he has 303 plague resistance. Basically he was trying to long-con him by inflicting Plague (which almost never happened) then switch to his claymore and try to out-fight him.
[5:18:01] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Regardless, I hope the rumors of Bluepoint on MGS1 are untrue
[5:18:13] <+RetartJack> @Esperflame Spoiler Alert: it didn't work. barbToxic
[5:18:16] <%hax_metatron> Coward ahead
[5:18:21] <+twohitgood> assist me doodBait
[5:18:24] <acexclover> whats going on? chat and pat?

[5:18:28] <%falineth> LUL one last time
[5:18:31] <acexclover> what do you think of the PS5?
[5:18:33] <%XeroSigmaPrime> An MGS1 remake would kinda sully that sick section in MGS4
[5:18:41] <DSD24> Ostrava is a cool dude
[5:18:59] <+twohitgood> ostrava is solaire of catarina.
[5:19:02] <+trekkie11041> @XeroSigmaPrime mgs1 remake exsits
[5:19:02] <%Nomenanza> @XeroSigmaPrime twin snakes cries in the corner
[5:19:19] <icantstopthescreams> Where nothing could go wrong
[5:19:27] <+twohitgood> you should be able to kill the dragon pretty fast with your stats.
[5:19:27] <FlamingoJazz> You flinched lol
[5:19:28] <%Chatterbox1991> oh hey Bloodborne
[5:19:28] <Esperflame> I love how the character model actually looks at the dragon
[5:19:29] <+RetartJack> @PatStaresAt Quick question for you: have you fought the Storm King yet? The sound design for that fight is fucking awesome! pooSwag
[5:19:30] <Mr_Strut> Hello hellkite
[5:19:30] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @trekkie11041 Shut up, no it doesnt. Twin Snakes doesnt exist XD
[5:19:32] <DSD24> The framerate always died here on PS3
[5:19:33] <%hax_metatron> If you have 3D headphones this dragon is amazing
[5:19:33] <+CapnClassix> Gonna cheese kill it?
[5:19:36] <islandoasis> i always mix up his name and otsdarva from armored core 4a
[5:19:39] <FlamingoJazz> What a COWARD
[5:19:40] <+CapnClassix> Grab that Purple Shield?
[5:19:46] <%tusk102> @icantstopthescreams OH NO IT ALL WENT WRONG
[5:19:46] <%Order_of_Mystery> bluepoint should have remade dark souls instead of whoever half-assed it the first time. god that remake is embarrassing.
[5:19:50] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Nomenanza Good, get it out of here with its dumb anime shit XD
[5:19:58] <+twohitgood> kill the dragon for some EZ souls?

[5:21:54] <%hax_metatron> You’re actually running up to the palace, protected by Tower Knight
[5:22:03] <+RetartJack> There's no reason for you to go down there....because the fucking Tower Knight doesn't life down there. barbToxic
[5:22:03] <fieriflavortown> It's a multi layered keep with is really rad
[5:22:05] <+twohitgood> it's that dragon's fault. you should make it pay.

[5:23:22] <CurrySauseBandit> @islandoasis Considering what they said they'd do for the game. I don't see how that's lame. They did exactly what they said they would.
[5:23:23] <+vaderxyz1970> That dragon really hates that bridge
[5:23:24] <+moondog_> can I get some ham and CHEESE
[5:23:27] <+CapnClassix> Outside the fog things are probably fine

[5:24:57] <+Aggro_Will> Demon's Souls: Two generations later and it has the EXACT SAME bullshit.

[5:25:06] <%Ynkubus_> @snow_bush Vinny doing three streams at once LUL
[5:25:06] <Esperflame> @acexclover Technically Demon's Souls and Dark Souls are not the same world. Dark Souls was called the spiritual successor by Miyazaki implying not the same thing
[5:25:07] <fieriflavortown> Not a war more like a massive curbstomp
[5:25:08] <+Hick12> So you are saying there are some cheap real estate opportunitiesin Boletaria?
[5:25:10] <highfivesquash> pretty sure this dragon just got mad and wrecked everything ala smaug
[5:25:10] <%Laecerelius> Remember kids, if you do drugs you go to Hell before you die!
[5:25:14] <+twohitgood> ...did you not get the dragon's soul?
[5:25:15] <%tusk102> @Chatterbox1991 king allant basically brought a bunch of demons and it fucked the world over
[5:25:23] <%hax_metatron> See Slack notifications
[5:25:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Chatterbox1991 Demons invaded stole souls rose the dead and dragons and shit are being scavengers

[5:26:49] <%falineth> playing online makes world tendency drift to the average right?
[5:26:51] <%Laecerelius> Seems to be slightly higher than the other ones?
[5:26:53] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt how can you tell? it looks the same to me

[5:27:55] <RubberFistFight> only they didn't even remotely finish it
[5:27:56] <mastertwin2> LORE
[5:27:59] <+CapnClassix> Technically, online doesn't affect PS3 version anymore...
[5:28:09] <Alexisonfires> @aeogard but this game only just came out Kappa how did pat already beat it 3 times
[5:28:10] <+RetartJack> @PatStaresAt Now go kill Old King Doran. barbToxic
[5:28:29] <%Ynkubus_> Most of the stuff for the 6th stone would be fodder for later games
[5:28:30] <RubberFistFight> "good things" move it towards white, "bad things" move it towards black
[5:28:31] <%Jaller101514> Youre kinda covering it by 1/4
[5:28:38] <%Aeogard> @Alexisonfires uh, he obviously got a ps5 by being a huge sony shill, that's how
[5:28:49] <%Laecerelius> Slightly
[5:28:55] <Alexisonfires> LUL
[5:29:03] <RubberFistFight> black makes it harder but drops are better
[5:29:03] <Esperflame> enemies are also worth less souls in pure white
[5:29:09] <RubberFistFight> and i think rare equipment shows up too?
[5:29:23] <+trekkie11041> black tendency also gravelords you @PatStaresAt
[5:29:33] <malamepos> racism
[5:29:35] <islandoasis> pat, confirmed pure white supremacist
[5:29:46] <+RetartJack> White Tendency increases item drops, too. pooSwag
[5:29:47] <+twohitgood> i'm pretty sure the broken archstone eventually inspired frozen eleum loyce. at least what was shown, it reminded me of that same winter vibe.
[5:29:50] <$Timesteel> killing non red npcs moves you towards black as well
[5:29:52] <Fefe41> You want pure white or black mainly for the new paths they open
[5:29:54] <$renyrells> pat saying you gotta keep it pure
[5:29:58] <%Chatterbox1991> so soft hard mode soft easy mode?
[5:30:03] <RubberFistFight> i think i ruined my world tendency near-immediately because I am bad and suck
[5:30:09] <+DeltascapeV4> Is the 4th world still not accessible?
[5:30:09] <mastertwin2> I believe the dragonbone smasher only shows up on certain tendencies, yeah?
[5:30:11] <%Aeogard> black phantom kills move it toward white too iirc
[5:30:11] <RubberFistFight> holy shit is this game kicking my ass
[5:30:15] <rjhascancer> @PatStaresAt what breed is the doggo?
[5:30:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @RetartJack Wasnt that Pure Black?
[5:30:16] <RubberFistFight> Tower of Latria was a nightmare
[5:30:20] <+RetartJack> So yeah, this game is racist. barbToxic
[5:30:22] <CappuccinoGuil> Tendencies affect events in the world too. Doors and paths are LOCKED if you're not at pure whtie
[5:30:27] <%Aeogard> dragonbone berserk reference is pure white
[5:30:37] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Chatterbox1991 but it's fucked in that soft easy mode is legitimately hard to achieve
[5:30:38] <%Captainahab_37> tower of latria is a nightmare and I hate it more than valley of defilement
[5:30:42] <+Aggro_Will> World tendency still seems like baffling nonsense. Like, From Software decided to put in the most opaque bullshit they could IMAGINE into the game, just to do it.
[5:30:43] <highfivesquash> OH THATS RIGHT WORLD TENDENCY AFFECTS DROPS AND REWARDS
[5:30:43] <%sirthomas2step> gosh this looks sleek
[5:30:44] <%greasypete00> the gattsu sword
[5:30:46] <islandoasis> i think the magic regen rod was a white tendacy weapon
[5:30:54] <+twohitgood> is it purewhite or just white? i saw someone else get the sword during the dragon god fight...not after.
[5:31:16] <RubberFistFight> @Aggro_Will have you played fromsoft games? "opaque bullshit" is what they do
[5:31:18] <+Hick12> Big Bonk Weapon.
[5:31:22] <%Nomenanza> that area on the left below Pat is black WT one iirc
[5:31:25] <%hax_metatron> You can have pure white while you enter Dragon God
[5:31:25] <highfivesquash> @twohitgod world tendency affects drop rates its just chance
[5:31:27] <+Aggro_Will> I KNOW!
[5:31:29] <%Aeogard> does anyone know if you can still fuck up your chances at crystal lizard drops in ps5?
[5:31:33] <DSD24> Purple Flame Shield!
[5:31:36] <%hax_metatron> You’ve beaten 3 bosses by the time you get to dragon god
[5:31:37] <%sirthomas2step> a great. red. dragon.
[5:31:42] <+RetartJack> @XeroSigmaPrime I think different items drops depending on being Pure Black vs Pure White. Last streamer I was watching play this was trying to farm an item that drops more depending on how white you are.
[5:31:52] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt do the crystal lizards respawn or are they like the original?
[5:31:57] <%Laecerelius> The lizards will respawn if you don't kill them in time while still getting more spawns as you kill bosses
[5:31:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt can't we resurect bosses this time arround? thus its easier to get Pure white?
[5:32:03] <PettyFunk> Scatman Patman
[5:32:12] <highfivesquash> If you have pure white world one and blacken out all the rest it becomes basically hell
[5:32:21] <$Timesteel> They no longer kill themselves from what I can tell
[5:32:21] <%sirthomas2step> you don't owe me world tendency u owe me awwweee
[5:32:37] <Esperflame> Each world also has different math on going black or white I think because each world has a different number of zones in it.
[5:32:41] <%Aeogard> 4-3 crystal lizards are still the worst thing in original DeS
[5:32:43] <+geistuser> I tried to buy doom eternal from humble bundle but couldnt because they RAN OUT OF BETHESDA CODES
[5:32:51] <%Neryl_> Neryl_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[5:33:04] <%Taisuru> Good
[5:33:05] <%Nomenanza> So I guess lizard drops are still kinda random? @PatStaresAt
[5:33:13] <i_am_therydon> thats fast
[5:33:20] <%Laecerelius> Murder by fart
[5:33:21] <%Aeogard> are any of the achievements still related to all the weapon upgrades?
[5:33:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> OH THATS BROEKN
[5:33:28] <$Timesteel> you can still cheese Allant with posion cloud LUL
[5:33:46] <%patriotrenegade> No one really uses these Poison Fog abilities in Souls games
[5:33:50] <blue8moon> sweetass poison
[5:33:50] <%Dutchpotato> yo magic in this game is cool as hell
[5:33:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> The ULTIMATE Bioweapon
[5:33:59] <+twohitgood> i always see talk of using it for the assassination missions.
[5:33:59] <pilllowofbees> Now you can make everyone smell the fart gass
[5:34:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> WHY USE POISE WHEN YOU CAN USE POISON!
[5:34:03] <%Taisuru> I heard they adjusted healing item weights?
[5:34:06] <+RetartJack> @PatStaresAt Take that spell and go fuck up Old King Doran. pooSwag
[5:34:08] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt well yeah, everyone likes their own brand Kappa
[5:34:09] <+TheBitingIrish> Is poison instant in this game? DansGame
[5:34:15] <%Chatterbox1991> are these dudes actually alive or are they zombies?
[5:34:17] <%rdark_ksu> breath my fart gas
[5:34:28] <%promessav2> that could effect you and it'd still be strong
[5:34:33] <bone_reaper69> everyone is immune to their own fart gas
[5:34:34] <%patriotrenegade> ooo, that was a good scream
[5:34:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Chatterbox1991 they have had their soul stolen so...yes
[5:34:41] <%sirthomas2step> i want a souls enemy to cup a fart in my face to make the death hurt less
[5:34:42] <+Hick12> Pat has harnesses the power of farts!
[5:34:53] <Esperflame> @Chatterbox1991 They're soul starved people who've been attack my soul devouring demons
[5:35:03] <@commanderclaw> The whiter you are the more free shit you get
[5:35:04] <Esperflame> my = by
[5:35:07] <%Aeogard> time to machine gun blue dragun
[5:35:12] <+twohitgood> @sirthomas2step so like a poison combust?
[5:35:13] <%Sasha_conyst> I'm very excited. My old tower plays Borderlands 2 which means I can play with this cute hoot whom I love. alexa4Wink
[5:35:20] <%arcielardor> wow Kamurocho certainly changed
[5:35:21] <+RetartJack> That dragon be purring like a kitty-kitty. feenHappy
[5:35:27] <+booty_menace> Black world tendency drops more upgrade materials and more souls but the enemies hit like a truck
[5:35:27] <DSD24> Purple Flame Shield!
[5:35:28] <%sirthomas2step> @twohitgood YES!!
[5:35:29] <%rdark_ksu> fart cloud that dragon
[5:35:30] <+twohitgood> you need pure white for that. the tail will still fuck you up.
[5:35:31] <DSD24> I love it
[5:35:40] <%Chatterbox1991> so they are insane like bloodbornem
[5:35:50] <+RetartJack> Put it in his pooper! barbToxic
[5:35:52] <%Laecerelius> Fart on the dragon!
[5:35:53] <i_am_therydon> he flies away pat
[5:35:56] <Esperflame> holy crap did you just duck that hitbox by picking up that item? NOICE!
[5:35:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> FUCKING NOTHING
[5:35:58] <islandoasis> dragon farted
[5:36:01] <+twohitgood> @PatStaresAt blue dragon doesn't have an active hitbox till 1-4.

[5:36:21] <CappuccinoGuil> ummmmm?
[5:36:21] <+twohitgood> it used to be that you couldn't attack it.
[5:36:22] <+Grayhammatter> BONK
[5:36:25] <Esperflame> Blue dragon was immortal in the original
[5:36:25] <%Emperor_Machinus> dragon fart
[5:36:28] <+CapnClassix> not even a sliver lol
[5:36:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> I hate that poison usually doesn't effect bosses
[5:36:38] <rjhascancer> thought he was untargetable for a sec lol
[5:36:38] <$renyrells> it was close tho
[5:36:41] <islandoasis> YOU DIED BUT THE NEXUS CLAIMS UR SOUL, IS THIS COOL? Y/N?
[5:36:41] <$Timesteel> he just flies off after a certain hp threshhold

[5:41:46] <RyuuAoi> What a ham!
[5:41:47] <%greasypete00> hey pat have you played any of valhalla yet?
[5:41:50] <@commanderclaw> I want to cuddle him!
[5:41:50] <TurtlesAndTentacles> you mean Demon's. WIth an S
[5:41:54] <Zackor1120> Just out of curiosity is there a reason you keep the harness on in the house?
[5:41:56] <%sirthomas2step> i had a pocket beagle. once adorbs on a new level
[5:42:02] <austinj24> C H O N K
[5:42:02] <%Nomenanza> FUUUUCK those load times are insane
[5:42:08] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt i used to have a bulldog named Bailey who was black and white like a cow
[5:42:10] <%Captainahab_37> valhalla makes me so sleepy
[5:42:12] <+RetartJack> The fun part is when you can start doing curls with your doggo as the weight. feenHappy
[5:42:22] <%sirthomas2step> das a big doggo
[5:42:28] <neraren> Why wont you hug him why he poops? He will feel neglected
[5:42:29] <+DeltascapeV4> That's adorable
[5:42:32] <%Captainahab_37> if you were a dog what kind of pooper would you be
[5:42:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt ....you gotta get your doggo to do doggo things
[5:42:35] <icantstopthescreams> How old is he now?
[5:42:37] <+dreamtemplar21> Not to be dramatic or anything but I would die for that dog
[5:42:44] <+TopTieramisu> squeeze the poop out of him
[5:42:49] <%Captainahab_37> the kind that can't go when people look or the dog that stares you in the eyes when it poops
[5:42:54] <%rdark_ksu> hope that doesn't become seperation anxiety. that shits a bitch
[5:42:55] <PettyFunk> @Captainahab_37 Speaking personally, newfie for sure.
[5:43:13] <%sirthomas2step> ekkk gad i never played this
[5:43:18] <%sirthomas2step> pitfalls galore
[5:43:19] <@commanderclaw> Is Faith viable in DeS?
[5:43:22] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Yeah, my bulldog does the same thing. She'll only fall asleep if someone is in the room with her
[5:43:31] <+twohitgood> being able to just send things to storage is such a massive time save.
[5:43:31] <%Captainahab_37> it's the easiest souls game
[5:43:34] <+TopTieramisu> faith is very strong
[5:43:35] <PettyFunk> I am terrified of death but I would happily give up immortality to have my stupid cat live exactly as long as me.
[5:43:40] <%Captainahab_37> well, 3 was easy too
[5:43:51] <@commanderclaw> Thank fuck, I got tired of it getting nerfed in DS
[5:43:55] <%sirthomas2step> @captainahab_37 yeah i was gonna say 3 is a breeze
[5:44:07] <Fefe41> Don't forget God's Wrath was killer for pvp ambush
[5:44:09] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt did they add item burden to make sure people can't do the stupid shit they do in future games with the 5 weapons and multiple sets of armor/because the healing items are consumables?
[5:44:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> Man pat Gief is the third most spoiled dog i've ever seen. Outside of my mah spoiling my old dog and my mah spoiling her current dog who detected my stepdad's cancer early
[5:44:22] <%Captainahab_37> I fucking suck ass at Sekiro
[5:44:46] <%sirthomas2step> @captainahab_37 dude. I was a ping pong ball in that game
[5:44:47] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt My English Bulldog doesnt have a lot of separation anxiety, unlike our French Bulldog who MUST go with you everywhere, we had to replace our frontdoor he had scratched it so much
[5:44:49] <@commanderclaw> @doc_ock_rokc They detected cancer? That's a good doggo
[5:45:00] <ExpressNode> @Captainahab_37 You're not alone
[5:45:02] <%sirthomas2step> i sucked through a straw at sekiro
[5:45:07] <%tusk102> whats harder, des or ds3?
[5:45:15] <%Captainahab_37> I got to lady butterfly and gave up
[5:45:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @commanderclaw they must have learned how it smelled from my dog
[5:45:17] <neraren> Thats a coool shield
[5:45:20] <%Captainahab_37> I'd say DeS for jank
[5:45:32] <tidalwafer> why is he green
[5:45:37] <$Timesteel> red eye knight armor is the dlc set
[5:45:37] <+CapnClassix> Is it still easy for him to get ganked if you don't babysit him?
[5:45:39] <%Laecerelius> It’s ya boi Ostrava!
[5:45:40] <OuijaTears> what O_O
[5:45:42] <+booty_menace> Thats red-eyed not blue eyed
[5:45:43] <redrins> its the red one that is deluxe edition
[5:45:45] <%Arweynn> are they in the game even if you dont preorder, though?
[5:45:47] <%Order_of_Mystery> Ostrava is kind of a punk... I feel bad for him
[5:45:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Is World Tendency the worst system FromSoft has ever made?
[5:45:53] <%promessav2> are you on earth?
[5:45:55] <@commanderclaw> You dad isn't your dad anymore
[5:45:56] <%superc37> noy quite, thats the blue eyed knight set not the red eye
[5:45:56] <fuji_92> are they? yeah don't think they are
[5:46:01] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the armor sets red eye, not blue eye
[5:46:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ostrava is punk young Solaire
[5:46:10] <%Captainahab_37> I wonder what the lore implications of Ostrava being a shitass are
[5:46:19] <mastertwin2> ISSA BLUD
[5:46:22] <+booty_menace> Fuck these dogs in this tunnel
[5:46:31] <blue8moon> death hole
[5:46:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Try Jumping
[5:46:33] <%sirthomas2step> Ostrava is this games sun bro?
[5:46:37] <huskarl_zap> tongue but hole
[5:46:39] <%Captainahab_37> nah it's a shortcut you get the best ring in the game there
[5:46:40] <%za7az> Thanks Pat
[5:46:43] <%PaladinDupre> the smell of des around you
[5:46:45] <+TopTieramisu> ostrava is more like seigmeyer than solaire
[5:46:46] <%Captainahab_37> it makes you big dick
[5:46:50] <%tusk102> @sirthomas2step more like onionbro
[5:46:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @sirthomas2step Sunbro is based on solaire
[5:47:01] <%sirthomas2step> Even. Better
[5:47:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> Wait what did i say
[5:47:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> I'm tired
[5:47:20] <%Captainahab_37> what's the worst redesign so far
[5:47:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> ignore my insane ramblings
[5:47:34] <+TopTieramisu> biorr is more like solaire
[5:47:39] <%sirthomas2step> i love that onion
[5:47:40] <%Order_of_Mystery> who would this game's version of Black Iron Tarkus be? the twinfang guy?
[5:47:49] <%tusk102> @Captainahab_37 probably maneaters
[5:47:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Damn it....where is patches?!
[5:47:57] <Fefe41> Biorr for sure
[5:48:03] <%promessav2> kill
[5:48:05] <huskarl_zap> @captainahab_37 5-2 water spirits
[5:48:11] <%sirthomas2step> @doc_ock_rokc in hell i hope
[5:48:11] <%hax_metatron> Play more with the Claymore Kreygasm
[5:48:11] <$Timesteel> he sells more stuff on 1-3
[5:48:21] <FlamingoJazz> Is this the first souls game with lip syncing?
[5:48:22] <oozebear> it makes me uncomfortable when souls characters' lips move
[5:48:30] <+TopTieramisu> tarkus is just a summon. biorr is more like solaire imo
[5:48:32] <%Garthunox> I like how the guy who looks evil is a decent guy and the guy who looks like an upstanding citizen is an absolute cunt
[5:48:32] <%Captainahab_37> did anyone else dual wield dragon bone smashers
[5:48:51] <%Monkeyweed21> looks like america
[5:48:51] <RubberFistFight> jeez pat they were up there suckin each others dicks and having a great time and you just had to go and ruin it Kappa
[5:48:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @sirthomas2step Patches is a SAINT infact he is practically a clairc in his own right
[5:48:59] <%Garthunox> Everything is tip top
[5:49:02] <Fefe41> But Biorr can solo the boss just like Tarkus
[5:49:03] <%rdark_ksu> they even build a community pool!
[5:49:05] <%Garthunox> How about you man?
[5:49:09] <NitronStreams> God this game is so fuckin pretty
[5:49:11] <%Captainahab_37> I had two dragon bone smashers and the good roll this game is broken
[5:49:13] <%MrUnKnownAlien> No problems there
[5:49:15] <%za7az> Only half of it is on fire!
[5:49:34] <%Captainahab_37> this place is good for free souls
[5:49:44] <RubberFistFight> @NitronStreams what's amazing is that in 60fps mode, it's 1440p internally "smart" upscaled to 4K, but it's still FUCKING GORGEOUS.
[5:49:59] <%sirthomas2step> @doc_ock_rokc patches is the guy who would sign your yearbook with a poo emoji
[5:50:03] <+TopTieramisu> lothric
[5:50:09] <%patriotrenegade> Lothric?
[5:50:11] <+booty_menace> Its the boss run to Lorhtic
[5:50:12] <%Chatterbox1991> so is what we are seeing now the mid point of a country being destroy or are we walking in the post war beatdown?
[5:50:18] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt price lothric and his brother Lorian
[5:50:20] <%tusk102> prince*
[5:50:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @sirthomas2step you can always trust patches to be patches
[5:50:24] <%patriotrenegade> Ohhh you mean on the bridge to the Twin Princes? @PatStaresAt
[5:50:24] <mastertwin2> Yeah there was like a rebellion going on between the Archives and the Castle
[5:50:29] <%Captainahab_37> I wonder if Elden Ring is gonna be a sad depressing grimdark hell too
[5:50:36] <%Dutchpotato> go to your profile
[5:50:39] <%Nomenanza> 3rd part of Lothric is VERY Boletaria-ish.
[5:50:42] <pth88> Hold down button -> go to right of play ....l
[5:50:44] <%tusk102> oh god
[5:50:45] <+bmj614> Trophies lol
[5:50:45] <+TheBitingIrish> @Captainahab_37 Oh, no doubt
[5:50:48] <%sirthomas2step> i liked him better as a spider
[5:50:49] <TheAmazingDemon69> Wouldn't know, don't have PS5 Yet
[5:50:55] <%Nomenanza> Almost as if Fromsoft reuses same concept with each souls game
[5:50:55] <+TopTieramisu> @Captainahab_37 i'm sure grrm will infuse the game with his trademark cheeful storytelling
[5:50:58] <+booty_menace> The secret acheevo for Tower Knight is to kill him without killing the crossbowmen
[5:51:15] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you were thinking of Lorian, who's the larger brother of Lothric
[5:51:16] <%T_Sasquatch> not a fan of this shitty square ui
[5:51:16] <%Captainahab_37> yeah but I wonder if it'll be as dire as souls
[5:51:18] <+booty_menace> Its actually really easy
[5:51:20] <%Nomenanza> @TheAmazingDemon69 welcome to "fuck scalpers" club
[5:51:20] <%superc37> eh thats not so bad tho
[5:51:25] <%Captainahab_37> or if there's actually cities and shit
[5:51:26] <%Order_of_Mystery> pew pew his head with magic missile?
[5:51:27] <$Timesteel> it was pretty easy they can't hit shit
[5:51:27] <%Garthunox> you gonna try it tho?
[5:51:31] <+twohitgood> you're pretty OP, though. and you have magic. shouldn't be too hard.
[5:51:32] <icantstopthescreams> Should be piss easy at your damage
[5:51:34] <%Captainahab_37> with those human things
[5:51:35] <%superc37> just dont get hit
[5:51:40] <+DeltascapeV4> I think you can do it\
[5:51:46] <%Garthunox> DRAGON
[5:51:49] <+SneakyBeaver102> Pat gonna platinum the game?
[5:51:56] <%sirthomas2step> the magic looks awesome in this game
[5:52:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> How long are you gonna drag on about the dragon
[5:52:04] <%sirthomas2step> just flicking spells
[5:52:05] <%Captainahab_37> I miss the old dme
[5:52:08] <+twohitgood> you can just damage tower directly without even knocking him down.
[5:52:11] <%Captainahab_37> demons souls opening*
[5:52:12] <Zackor1120> Most likely will platinum it
[5:52:14] <+TopTieramisu> god, even poison gas looks cool
[5:52:20] <%Captainahab_37> with the funny trumpet
[5:52:21] <%bevyrage> pew pew pew
[5:52:24] <islandoasis> wait, this isnt penis-traitor boss, this is escaflowne
[5:52:26] <%sirthomas2step> rock the dragon
[5:52:27] <taquito_blade> i remember being able to snipe the dragon from the first tower
[5:52:28] <PettyFunk> That was nearly a Michael Jackson sound
[5:52:34] <RubberFistFight> Salty fucks are giving this game so much shit literally because of how good it looks
[5:52:39] <%Elky3> why is he playing as Plague of Gropes?
[5:52:40] <islandoasis> i was all really for some good hard penertrating
[5:52:42] <RubberFistFight> they actually argue that it's worse because it looks better
[5:52:45] <TheAmazingDemon69> does his shield block poison?
[5:52:48] <+barrakuta371> That fire spell looks so cool
[5:52:49] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt is there a soul stream/beam in this game?
[5:52:52] <%Captainahab_37> some redesigns I know are worse
[5:52:58] <%Garthunox> isnt this where bjorr is?
[5:53:00] <taquito_blade> oh shit tower knight!
[5:53:02] <+TopTieramisu> some redesigns are kinda perplexing
[5:53:05] <%tusk102> damn
[5:53:08] <%sirthomas2step> i just learned u could parry spells in ds3
[5:53:14] <$Timesteel> I invaded here on NG+ for my invasion trophy 4 crossbowmen and 2 blue eye knight dude never stood a chance LUL
[5:53:14] <%Captainahab_37> but the game is still good
[5:53:14] <+TopTieramisu> dude, the fat official looks way worse now
[5:53:16] <RubberFistFight> jesus fucking christ
[5:53:19] <%tusk102> @TopTieramisu that maneater one is. real bad
[5:53:20] <%Maids4lyfe> no giant laser beam unfortunately
[5:53:20] <blue8moon> well that wrecked him
[5:53:21] <+barrakuta371> Demolished that guy
[5:53:25] <%Chatterbox1991> op?
[5:53:41] <+twohitgood> was there a party beam in DS2? i think that might be only DS3.
[5:53:41] <%Captainahab_37> magic in demons is totally not broken we swear
[5:53:47] <RubberFistFight> yeah so uh i've been playing this game wrong
[5:53:50] <RubberFistFight> XD
[5:53:53] <%Taisuru> Large Headass Shard
[5:53:54] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt are you going blueblood sword?
[5:53:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> fuck you its magic I don't need to explain shit
[5:54:05] <+TopTieramisu> maneater's not much of a looker, but the old maneater looked like some stone gargoyle
[5:54:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Captainahab_37 magic is broken in almost every souls game
[5:54:08] <%Captainahab_37> faith was fuckin fun
[5:54:17] <%tusk102> some variety is always nice!
[5:54:17] <RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc so magic in this is the speedforce, got it
[5:54:18] <+TopTieramisu> kinda weird
[5:54:18] <+booty_menace> LUCKY FAITH
[5:54:18] <%Maids4lyfe> ds3 was the only one with a beam, ds2 was close with a giant soul arrow
[5:54:24] <%Captainahab_37> I always just go big sword hit hard
[5:54:28] <%Order_of_Mystery> you're abandoning blueblood? HERESY!
[5:54:28] <$Timesteel> Blueblood is supremely broken right now due to the gold coin glitch
[5:54:30] <RubberFistFight> well i mean actually the speedforce IS explicitly made of some weird kind of magic
[5:54:36] <%PaladinDupre> MGS then?
[5:54:36] <%Taisuru> @doc_ock_rokc Not fuckin 3 that's for sure :V
[5:54:38] <RubberFistFight> dimensional magic bullshit
[5:54:39] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt There is a glitch in the game that can let you infinitely lvl up your luck stat and turn Blue Blood into a 1 hit kill monstrosity
[5:54:40] <%Garthunox> wait i mustve missed this feature
[5:54:45] <%Garthunox> thats insane
[5:54:45] <+CapnClassix> Moonlight Great Sword is a fun build too
[5:54:57] <+twohitgood> pat's definitely aware of the luck glitch.
[5:55:03] <%Captainahab_37> I like my rock on a stick
[5:55:05] <+TopTieramisu> it wouldn't be demon's souls without some super exploitable glitch
[5:55:09] <%sirthomas2step> i like chaos magic but i always love moonlight greatsword
[5:55:09] <RubberFistFight> god i read that as "fuck glitch"
[5:55:09] <%Maids4lyfe> the moonlight sword is so pretty in this version
[5:55:13] <+barrakuta371> @ScreamLord He knows about it
[5:55:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Taisuru yeah I guess after 2 where magic was fucking king its kinda hard to go back to ds1 level magic
[5:55:16] <blue8moon> He talked about the luck glitch last stream
[5:55:17] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt i went through dark souls ass backwards because i started with 3, then bb, then ds2, then 1.
[5:55:20] <RubberFistFight> i'm thinkin "what the fuck did bluepoint put in this game?"
[5:55:33] <redrins> it also ignores shields
[5:55:33] <%Order_of_Mystery> wait what
[5:55:41] <%king_wragles> gotem
[5:55:42] <%Garthunox> no str requirement?
[5:55:43] <ScreamLord> A faith weapon that does magic damage
[5:55:44] <%Avm01> Neat
[5:55:44] <RubberFistFight> is it the cup of a carpenter tho
[5:55:45] <%Captainahab_37> is temple knight the one with the halberd?
[5:55:45] <overlord_nico> So are the dragons just demons that look like dragons?
[5:55:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> just like bloodborne in a way
[5:55:51] <%Captainahab_37> temple knight is cool
[5:55:51] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Huh
[5:55:52] <neraren> Did you see the new door was solved?
[5:55:53] <%Order_of_Mystery> does it fire sword lasers?
[5:55:56] <+TopTieramisu> bluepoint put in the penetrator armor
[5:55:57] <%Daniel_Is_I> Nope just 24 faith iirc
[5:56:00] <+CapnClassix> First time I played Dark Souls, went faith to use the Moonlight sword. Imagine my disappoint...
[5:56:01] <BinaryShuffle> Nothing says cleric like a HUEG claymore
[5:56:01] <islandoasis> i dont think so
[5:56:02] <taquito_blade> it makes sense being wehre its at
[5:56:04] <RubberFistFight> god i fucking loathe this fight
[5:56:05] <redrins> no lasers
[5:56:05] <RubberFistFight> LOATHE IT
[5:56:10] <islandoasis> the moonlight sword in this game was a laser blade
[5:56:11] <%Garthunox> thats busted if true
[5:56:14] <islandoasis> so super light
[5:56:16] <+twohitgood> just shoot him in the face.
[5:56:18] <%tusk102> YEYEYYEYEYEYE
[5:56:18] <FlamingoJazz> wow
[5:56:19] <%sirthomas2step> is something bad about to happen?
[5:56:22] <%Garthunox> ITS YA BOI
[5:56:23] <ScreamLord> @Order_of_Mystery Sadly no, not in this game. I looks fucking awesome tho
[5:56:26] <RubberFistFight> although that bitch that clones herself with the traps on the floor can suck the widest part of my cock.
[5:56:26] <%whyskeywolfe> oh he big boy
[5:56:27] <%superc37> why the fight isnt even that hard lol
[5:56:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> I'm kinda sad Karmatic justice never came back

[5:57:06] <ArkhamBenji> I tell ya Hwhat

[5:57:09] <RubberFistFight> @superc37 i just can't my head around the distances or how to avoid some of the stuff he does. I fully recognise that it's my failing, not the game's.
[5:57:11] <valriot> Wowwwwwww

[5:57:26] <taquito_blade> god i love how fast you load back in
[5:57:30] <icantstopthescreams> That damage is insane tho
[5:57:30] <Fefe41> He almost killed the boss before it toppled
[5:57:31] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt do you even need to hit his head???
[5:57:32] <alwayspronking> LUL
[5:57:35] <%Arrotal> watch out for the shield
[5:57:35] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Ouch

[5:57:47] <%Agami23> wait what? when did you start playing demons souls??
[5:57:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pro tip, Hit the enemy with your sword to do damage!
[5:57:54] <%za7az> Quick, dodge left!
[5:58:00] <%bevyrage> @tusk102 you can deal more damage to the head than you can to the legs
[5:58:01] <%Agami23> i was watching porp since you were doing yakuza. now i feel dumb
[5:58:03] <sonicblade38> wtf magic did he use to do THAT much dmg?
[5:58:04] <RubberFistFight> @Agami23 little over an hour and a half ago?
[5:58:06] <islandoasis> is dsp playing this yet?
[5:58:06] <%Captainahab_37> have you guys seen it when motion blur in this is all the way up?
[5:58:07] <+TopTieramisu> no cling ring?
[5:58:08] <%sirthomas2step> hit it until it dies!
[5:58:08] <%Order_of_Mystery> tower knight dropped his shield, lmao

[5:58:25] <%bevyrage> dsp is still alive yes
[5:58:26] <TheAmazingDemon69> Fragrant ring? what, do you sniff it to regain that mp?
[5:58:27] <CrimsonFox777> If Herculean is a word in the Demon's Souls universe, does that mean that Hercules existed therea at one point too?
[5:58:27] <%T_Sasquatch> motion blur is a shit effect
[5:58:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tusk102 if only you could talk to the demons
[5:58:31] <valriot> Pat you got it too half with just his ankles, just beat on him
[5:58:32] <RubberFistFight> @Agami23 you didn't miss much, he explained world tendency then walked into the tower knight swinging his dick, and got fucking flattened.
[5:58:36] <%bevyrage> ooooh that makes sense tusk
[5:58:39] <%Captainahab_37> did DSP jerk off again?
[5:58:40] <+TopTieramisu> dsp will outlive us all

[5:58:53] <%Agami23> sweet
[5:58:54] <%tusk102> @doc_ock_rokc no talk, only rip and or tear
[5:59:06] <%Emperor_Machinus> You defeated Tower knight now do a RE4 El gigante cutscene
[5:59:09] <blue8moon> He's trying to get the tower knight achievement for not killing the archers
[5:59:09] <%Dutchpotato> DSP is always jerking off
[5:59:09] <%sirthomas2step> use judgement cut
[5:59:24] <islandoasis> dsp is my spirit animal
[5:59:30] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt just fucking beat on him you halved his health with your sword and a bit of poison
[5:59:31] <%DocChutney> DocChutney subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! over a year of being an eyeball! the grossness grows

[6:00:48] <blue8moon> the poison is super cool, but you're just murdering things with your sword, so it's kinda pointless right now :\
[6:00:49] <%sirthomas2step> @rubberfistfight I think so?
[6:00:50] <+TopTieramisu> you're not liberating boletaria
[6:00:58] <+twohitgood> especially when you're high level.
[6:01:13] <%DeaconBluesClues> hey wait a minute this isn't like souls at all! where are all the cliffs with awful pathing you just all off for no goddamned reason
[6:01:13] <%tusk102> BEAT ON THIS MOTHERFUCKER

[6:01:42] <%T_Sasquatch> arrows are ironically the hardest part of the fight
[6:01:43] <%Monkeyweed21> wow you suck
[6:01:43] <neraren> Do weapons and armors drop in a similar manner to DS? Low % chance of a given pieces from the guys using it?
[6:01:48] <Noogiez> can you pew them?
[6:01:51] <+TopTieramisu> @doc_ock_rokc you're saving humanity. boletaria is basically dead at this point LUL
[6:01:52] <ammobasket> stick in the craw
[6:01:55] <islandoasis> Pat vs a normal sized person
[6:01:55] <%tusk102> Does he ever use his spear? @PatStaresAt
[6:02:02] <%DeaconBluesClues> when you fight one reborn in bloodborne you stab all the ladies right
[6:02:03] <oozebear> the adds are always the worst part
[6:02:07] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Got to love them
[6:02:11] <%Captainahab_37> you fuckin rip and tear
[6:02:15] <valriot> Is boss is Pat trying to grab candy while Paignton defends it
[6:02:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TopTieramisu but you are killing people who want to keep the gate open for power
[6:02:24] <RubberFistFight> @DeaconBluesClues yeah
[6:02:24] <blue8moon> ye, one reborn is partly based on this fight
[6:02:25] <+twohitgood> he uses the spear and can also cast soul arrow (or maybe ray?)
[6:02:27] <islandoasis> you gotten be more hit and run with the arrows out
[6:02:30] <%tusk102> IT SUPER IS
[6:02:34] <%Agami23> yup
[6:02:38] <valriot> Well yeah
[6:02:38] <mastertwin2> it's just tower knight 2
[6:02:39] <%T_Sasquatch> I hate boss runs sooooo much
[6:02:47] <valriot> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[6:02:49] <%YakumoYomi> ...what?
[6:02:50] <RubberFistFight> Yeah it's mechanically a very similar fight - you kill the bell ringers, then attack The One's limbs until he drops his head/face
[6:02:51] <blue8moon> Plus it's got the ladies up top firing magic at you
[6:02:52] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt he also falls over and you do big damage to the top half
[6:02:53] <RubberFistFight> and then wail on it
[6:02:53] <%MaxeusTheFirst> But thats just a theory. A game theory!
[6:02:54] <%Monkeyweed21> its also a super similar arena
[6:02:54] <%sirthomas2step> gettin the tony Montana treatment
[6:02:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> God I wanna play Bloodborne but I don't have a ps4/5
[6:02:58] <%Captainahab_37> I still need to play the bloodborne dlc
[6:03:02] <%MrUnKnownAlien> I see
[6:03:07] <mastertwin2> and you can knock the heads down on a stagger and deal big damage
[6:03:07] <oozebear> a boss made entirely of feet, i nut
[6:03:08] <%moogleboy1984> You going for the achievement?
[6:03:14] <+TopTieramisu> i pity the foo that hasn't played bloodborne
[6:03:19] <TheAmazingDemon69> THAT was hot
[6:03:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> DS Hitbox porn
[6:03:22] <+TopTieramisu> i really hope they remaster it
[6:03:23] <%sirthomas2step> orphan of kos is a fun fight with arcane
[6:03:25] <%Monkeyweed21> good hitbox on that Boruto
[6:03:30] <%Nomenanza> I wouldn't say "it is made of feet" the reason it is a tower knight reference, the arena is more of a callback yeah.
[6:03:32] <islandoasis> entirely made out of feet? did dan schneider make a game?
[6:03:36] <%tusk102> @TopTieramisu make fun of plague then he HATES it
[6:03:38] <%Monkeyweed21> Are they shooting Borutos at you?
[6:03:48] <+CapnClassix> Do you still need to upgrade with every material for plat?
[6:03:49] <blue8moon> you can just stunlock the one reborn with a chainsaw too, good times
[6:03:51] <Zebroneath> You don't talk about getting achievements often.
[6:03:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @sirthomas2step then you can put it on your fists and beat people to death fisticuff style!
[6:03:56] <+TopTieramisu> @tusk102 nobody's perfect LUL
[6:03:59] <mastertwin2> easy how? don't you have to get all the endings like the other games?
[6:04:11] <%T_Sasquatch> im not sure if im scared of bloodborne but i always need to be in a certain mood before i play it LUL
[6:04:12] <+CapnClassix> Pure Bladestone was responsible for many an abandoned plat
[6:04:40] <%moogleboy1984> That effect is super good looking
[6:04:40] <islandoasis> that soul damage on the feet are kinda cool
[6:04:52] <+TopTieramisu> bluepoint fixed souls camera
[6:04:53] <%tusk102> why does plague hate bloodborne so much anyway? is it literally just cuz it's not dark souls?
[6:04:53] <+CapnClassix> Still one of my more proud platinums lol
[6:04:58] <+TopTieramisu> they did the impossible
[6:05:00] <Zebroneath> and it actually shows more of the boss.
[6:05:03] <+Dorf1> trophys in the og were outsourced iirc
[6:05:05] <%Order_of_Mystery> holy fuck
[6:05:06] <Zackor1120> Jesus that head dmg
[6:05:08] <blue8moon> ye ye ye
[6:05:08] <+antiziano> YOU. DID. IT.
[6:05:09] <%T_Sasquatch> hahahhaahahhaha
[6:05:09] <%Dutchpotato> Jesus christ
[6:05:09] <valriot> LUL LUL LUL
[6:05:11] <+TopTieramisu> @tusk102 i think it's partly for the memes
[6:05:12] <ammobasket> yeyeye
[6:05:17] <Sunstalker> NG+ already?
[6:05:18] <+barrakuta371> One Shall Fall
[6:05:19] <+CapnClassix> three head smacks
[6:05:20] <NitronStreams> kinda feel bad for the guy
[6:05:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> TELL YOUR KING YOUR KNIGHT WAS A BITCH
[6:05:22] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Lol
[6:05:24] <RubberFistFight> nice work dude
[6:05:25] <%Chatterbox1991> so what exactly is he; a giant, a demon or some gollum or something?
[6:05:35] <chaumiester> ...... So, what happened to the Archers? Just poof?
[6:05:36] <%Garthunox> @Sunstalker no?
[6:05:36] <%SaiyanShoto> Holy shit Pat LUL LUL LUL
[6:05:37] <%tusk102> @TopTieramisu possibly but during their des playthrough i remember him shit talking it pretty bad
[6:05:37] <islandoasis> he's a tower knight
[6:05:38] <NitronStreams> you basically just trip him and hew dies
[6:05:41] <%sirthomas2step> Yeaaaaa thats one big head you just nailed to your wall!!
[6:05:42] <blue8moon> the hardest part of this boss is the adds, not the boss
[6:05:43] <%Nomenanza> probably a soul arts construct
[6:05:55] <oozebear> gollum is the dude with the ring, golem is the artificial man
[6:05:56] <+TopTieramisu> bloodborne is not plague's favorite, but he exaggerates his dislike for it because his character demands it
[6:06:01] <+TheBitingIrish> Yeah, pure magin on the inside
[6:06:03] <+twohitgood> @Chatterbox1991 he's a corrupted knight. you fight his black phantom later in 1-4 in bwt.
[6:06:05] <%Monkeyweed21> more like bitch demon soul
[6:06:08] <%SaiyanShoto> More like Tower Bitch
[6:06:08] <%Order_of_Mystery> didn't tower knight used to be a regular dude? or was he always a fuck-huge golem
[6:06:09] <%Chatterbox1991> also all the metal creaking and such
[6:06:13] <%T_Sasquatch> it was clearly exploding blue soul juice
[6:06:14] <Zackor1120> Well doesn't the soul like stuff leaking out of his ankles once you crack them open also kinda tell that it's just armor
[6:06:14] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Just fall over when your leader dies
[6:06:15] <Dellago> Is Penetrator also some sort of construct? I remember him being big too
[6:06:18] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt i think it's armor with just magic in it which is why wen you slash it's legs, blue shoots out
[6:06:23] <%Maids4lyfe> I wonder why no one has tried to just set the Old One on fire
[6:06:27] <+TopTieramisu> bloodborne
[6:06:28] <%Monkeyweed21> it was not
[6:06:31] <alwayspronking> Over Bloodborne?
[6:06:36] <BlindGato> Bloodborne tho
[6:06:37] <%tusk102> @Dellago he's only like 9-10 feet
[6:06:39] <%superc37> id say ds1 or bb
[6:06:40] <neraren> Yeah Bloodborne is a tough beat
[6:06:41] <%sirthomas2step> Demon Souls has a purity to it
[6:06:43] <%za7az> Bloodborne
[6:06:45] <%patriotrenegade> Bloodborne is Fromsoft's best game
[6:06:45] <%T_Sasquatch> its clearly not due to how fucked it is on ps3
[6:06:45] <%tusk102> bloodborne tho
[6:06:52] <%R3Roundabout> Nice
[6:06:53] <blue8moon> I love Bloodborne most <3
[6:06:57] <%Monkeyweed21> Thats just the feeling of a full nostalgia diaper @PatStaresAt
[6:06:58] <CrowbarFacelift> Dark Souls, despite the second half, is still the best to me. Bloodborne and DeS are the next two but they're both great I can't choose.
[6:07:01] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[6:07:05] <RubberFistFight> I find the OG demons souls to be too rough around the edges to be fun for very long. Like, I recognise that it's "good", but yeah. Could never do it in anything more than short bursts.
[6:07:05] <boardscanada> thanks for dropping all this tech Pat
[6:07:05] <islandoasis> um, the best game they ever made was metal wolf chaos you butt
[6:07:05] <supergoblinpunch> DS1 is for me
[6:07:07] <%Chatterbox1991> @patstaresat is this better than DS1 in your head atm?
[6:07:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> Bare Seek Seek Lest
[6:07:09] <CrimsonFox777> The land has been cleansed by your purity!
[6:07:11] <+twohitgood> tower knight is "Alfred, Knight of the Tower" after being corrupted by the fog.
[6:07:12] <%hax_metatron> Nothing beats DS1 for me
[6:07:12] <TheDarkRemRem99> demons souls is the best souls bloodborne is the best in the soulsbornesekiring universe
[6:07:14] <%Order_of_Mystery> @PatStaresAt so with the remake and subsequent renewed interest in it, do you think we'll ever see DeS 2?
[6:07:17] <oozebear> no black at all, just how pat likes it
[6:07:18] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Reset once more to test, I think my tendency reset when i relogged
[6:07:22] <%hax_metatron> DS1 is my favorite game of all time
[6:07:27] <%sirthomas2step> I love Bloodborne too the bosses are too good
[6:07:31] <Sunstalker> Thematically, it's reallygood. But stuff like weapon upgrade paths and gender exclusive gear and the grass farming? That shit is not great
[6:07:39] <+BlockingDisabled> DeS is good, but has too many annoying mechanics IMO
[6:07:42] <mastertwin2> there's a primal jank to DeS that makes me love it on another level than Dark Souls
[6:07:44] <valriot> Demons Souls lets you play fuckery builds that don't require SL200, and doesn't have a dumb PVP meta dictating where invasions are, and doesn't nerf my fucking faith build HALF WAY THROUGH THE RUN
[6:07:45] <%hax_metatron> Imagine a DS1 remake of this fidelity Kreygasm
[6:07:46] <%AzureGale> eat it
[6:07:46] <wynnewake> bloodborne for me
[6:07:48] <%patriotrenegade> ur wrong tho
[6:07:50] <+Kongu_Bongu> LUL
[6:07:52] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt over bloodborne?
[6:07:53] <Fefe41> Demons Souls got the best stages
[6:07:55] <+barrakuta371> That was on purpose, right?
[6:07:58] <%Monkeyweed21> the best game he says as he kills himself to avoid world tendency nonsense @PatStaresAt
[6:08:00] <%T_Sasquatch> @hax_metatron is ps3 ds1 still worth it or do i just get the ps4 version ?
[6:08:01] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Nice
[6:08:04] <%Order_of_Mystery> demon's souls doesn't have the bed of chaos in it, and is therefore the better game
[6:08:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> Don't wanna go down to blight town
[6:08:11] <+twohitgood> demon's souls and DS1 are pretty neck and neck for best.
[6:08:13] <CrowbarFacelift> Stumbling upon Ash Lake is a top 5 moment ever for me
[6:08:15] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> See a place go there is cooler.
[6:08:20] <+TopTieramisu> what about going down to the lava area and looking up at all the dragon butts?
[6:08:22] <+Mr_Morbid> Blighttown DansGame
[6:08:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Don't wanna go down to that poison town
[6:08:27] <%hax_metatron> Now where’s Elden Ring
[6:08:32] <Sunstalker> Order_of_Mystery Dragon God ain't much better DansGame
[6:08:35] <+barrakuta371> YAY!
[6:08:43] <%tusk102> yaaaay
[6:08:44] <+CapnClassix> What a horrible decision that was
[6:08:45] <+Grayhammatter> oh shit
[6:08:45] <CrowbarFacelift> just like real life
[6:08:46] <%Monkeyweed21> World tendency might be the worst system From Soft ever made
[6:08:49] <ExpressNode> Did he do all that just to see what would happen after online check-in?
[6:08:50] <%T_Sasquatch> LUL
[6:08:50] <%Xelhesia> ARMORED CORE FOR ANSWER IS THE BEST. I SPENT OVER 1,000 HOURS JUST CUSTOMIZING MECHS
[6:08:51] <%hax_metatron> I still remember Woolie marking out at the shortcuts in Dark Souls 1. Their best LP to me.
[6:08:52] <neraren> Youre saying being white has its advantages?
[6:08:53] <NitronStreams> aw jeez
[6:08:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> We have WHITE PRIVLAGE
[6:08:56] <%VashyronM> like anyone here is pure white
[6:08:58] <Manjove> i love being pure white
[6:09:00] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt so you're saying you've got pure white privilege? Kappa
[6:09:02] <%Nomenanza> @T_Sasquatch you will only be able to experience OG DS1 on PS3 probably, since all other stores now only list the """"remaster"""
[6:09:03] <%T_Sasquatch> ONLY THE PUREST WHITES
[6:09:06] <rjhascancer> lmao
[6:09:09] <%sirthomas2step> I wish I could get world tendency at work
[6:09:09] <NitronStreams> Ooof
[6:09:10] <John_Tsuda> I don't get it
[6:09:11] <rjhascancer> this game is woke
[6:09:11] <supergoblinpunch> LUL
[6:09:12] <islandoasis> mildred here?
[6:09:13] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat loves being white
[6:09:15] <%Maids4lyfe> WHITE PRIVILEGE
[6:09:15] <@commanderclaw> And people will drop more loot for you
[6:09:16] <+Draegen86> wow what a soudbite
[6:09:16] <valriot> White Privilege
[6:09:16] <%superc37> HUH
[6:09:17] <%whyskeywolfe> Unless you're Irish.
[6:09:17] <+TheBitingIrish> Oooo, that's nice
[6:09:21] <+CapnClassix> King's Field is janky goodness
[6:09:21] <%Chatterbox1991> I appriciate a lot of the Edlritch Lovecraftian stuff in ds3
[6:09:25] <+booty_menace> Colorless demon soul incoming Pog
[6:09:25] <+CapnClassix> all 15 frames of it
[6:09:25] <%superc37> THATS A P BIG CHANGE
[6:09:26] <+ChainsawBees> is this a true remake or did they add new areas and bosses?
[6:09:26] <+TheBitingIrish> @whyskeywolfe yo wtf
[6:09:28] <%Order_of_Mystery> @Sunstalker he doesn't swipe you into death pits tho
[6:09:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Wait, when it open, IT STAYS OPEN?! THATS AMAZING
[6:09:34] <Manjove> i love being pure black
[6:09:35] <%Nomenanza> iirc some black phantoms spawn here
[6:09:36] <+TopTieramisu> world tendency haters LUL
[6:09:38] <valriot> You can go down here and not get arrested, nice
[6:09:39] <+twohitgood> the colorless soul is down there in white, too.
[6:09:39] <%Nomenanza> well here they be
[6:09:43] <RubberFistFight> oh wow, red phantoms
[6:09:47] <RubberFistFight> like DS2
[6:09:57] <%XeroSigmaPrime> THEY FIXED TENDENCY, BLUEPOINT THESE MADLADS
[6:09:58] <%Nomenanza> Executioner lady should also be in this zone iirc
[6:10:04] <%Nomenanza> or is that black only?
[6:10:10] <%sirthomas2step> i never got to play ds2 i want too
[6:10:11] <+TopTieramisu> enemy despawning is worse than world tendency
[6:10:14] <+TopTieramisu> miralda is best girl
[6:10:15] <+Grayhammatter> that's a lotta souls
[6:10:21] <Sunstalker> Time for the hottest chick in the game PogChamp
[6:10:21] <%sirthomas2step> punch my way through that one
[6:10:21] <Smitteys867> @PatStaresAt do you think future fromsoft games should worry about matching this remake's level of fidelity/animation/etc?
[6:10:25] <+twohitgood> the exeuctioner lady will be here in human form which will lower WT when killed.
[6:10:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt have we meet the crows yet?
[6:10:27] <%Chatterbox1991> Do Black, White and Neutral world tendancies exsist in different points in time?
[6:10:35] <%goatbait> goatbait subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Can't believe it's already been a year, can't stay since I gotta catch up with the vods, so have a good stream
[6:10:40] <%tusk102> @Smitteys867 that is a pipedream
[6:10:41] <%Agami23> they fixed my 3 biggest problems. the tendency, the crystal lizards, and the inventory weight
[6:10:53] <Zackor1120> Masoluem key
[6:10:54] <+TopTieramisu> the key ostrava has

[6:11:14] <+A0N33> Speaking of, have you heard about the new door that got added in the remake?
[6:11:14] <%sirthomas2step> im happy i subbed tonight finally, i watched the whole re3 run on YT
[6:11:15] <+Mr_Morbid> Dolan PLS
[6:11:19] <%sirthomas2step> no ragrets
[6:11:24] <%logoth_> old king dolan
[6:11:25] <+Grayhammatter> danger dolan's key
[6:11:25] <+barrakuta371> it's the keyblade, Sora
[6:11:32] <valriot> BIG AXE
[6:11:37] <%Maids4lyfe> @Order_of_Mystery glad to know I'm not the only one who thought of him LUL
[6:11:38] <+TopTieramisu> did they change her armor?
[6:11:38] <+reclines_obesily> men can wear it now
[6:11:40] <blue8moon> gender locked gear is bs
[6:11:40] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt ah yes. the key. the key for dolan. the key specifically made for dolans door. dolans key. that key.
[6:11:41] <islandoasis> whats her name again?
[6:11:44] <+scrumbotime> well now you can feed a statue souls and become ladies
[6:11:49] <%moogleboy1984> can be yours for the low low price of paying souls for a gender reassignment at the Nexus
[6:11:49] <+twohitgood> which is much easier in this game since you can just pray to the goddess statue to change your character to women.
[6:11:50] <pth88> mildred
[6:11:51] <Manjove> wow, sexist game devs
[6:11:53] <IndoorSitup> Also known as "Body Type A's."
[6:11:54] <%tusk102> doubt!
[6:11:56] <%superc37> WHAT
[6:11:58] <+snickers_md> It's current year
[6:12:00] <Sunstalker> Miralda is who I make in the Bloodborne character creator every time :)
[6:12:00] <%Nomenanza> no axe from her?
[6:12:01] <+TopTieramisu> miralda
[6:12:01] <%KaiserMario> If you kill her on Pure White, she doesn't appear in Pure Black, and you can't get her weapon
[6:12:02] <+TheBitingIrish> Equality :D
[6:12:02] <Dellago> Oh they drop gendered armor?
[6:12:08] <+barrakuta371> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[6:12:09] <%superc37> YESYESYES
[6:12:11] <%tusk102> YEAAAAAA
[6:12:13] <blue8moon> oh sweet
[6:12:14] <CrimsonFox777> GENDER EQUALITY
[6:12:18] <%moogleboy1984> wait real shit!?
[6:12:25] <%Chatterbox1991> egalitarian revisionism ftw
[6:12:26] <%superc37> FUCKING FINALLY
[6:12:26] <%tusk102> REAL SHIT
[6:12:27] <%Order_of_Mystery> Bluepoint confirmed best devs ever
[6:12:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> WHY IS BLUEPOINT THE FUCKING BEST
[6:12:29] <IndoorSitup> @patstaresat Of course, because it's the current year!
[6:12:30] <+barrakuta371> Oh fuck me then
[6:12:31] <%T_Sasquatch> PridePog
[6:12:31] <+shinpete> DansGame
[6:12:35] <+snickers_md> comes with a free noose
[6:12:37] <ammobasket> oooOOOOO
[6:12:40] <alwayspronking> Nice
[6:12:41] <%VashyronM> I mean, they dropped gender right? It's just body type now
[6:12:44] <+twohitgood> there's definitely still gender specific armor in the game.
[6:12:49] <MildMannered_Creighton> hot
[6:12:50] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Bluepoint literally made this the BEST SOULS GAME EVER
[6:12:54] <%Order_of_Mystery> NOW WHY COULDN'T THEY DO THAT TO EVERY OTHER SET
[6:12:55] <islandoasis> you can wear it if you identify as a soul sucking demon
[6:12:56] <blue8moon> now you two can wear this cool outfit, men
[6:13:06] <+twohitgood> @VashyronM it's referred to as body type 1 or 2 but it's still there for some armors.
[6:13:07] <Dellago> Im trying to remember what the male only armor was in this. LIke there was one really good one
[6:13:08] <%Maids4lyfe> omg
[6:13:13] <+TopTieramisu> they redesigned the executioner set, didn't they

[6:13:20] <%Order_of_Mystery> wait when did Pat beat Old Monk? this stream?
[6:13:21] <%sirthomas2step> that yellow crown just confuses me
[6:13:21] <+TopTieramisu> i'm not digging it as much
[6:13:21] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt theres still other gendered armor so this specific one being like that is kinda odd
[6:13:22] <IndoorSitup> c u r r e n t y e a r
[6:13:25] <%VashyronM> @twohitgood bleh

[6:13:56] <$Timesteel> fast climb PogChamp
[6:13:58] <blue8moon> it was the armor that made people role a specific gendered character
[6:14:10] <+twohitgood> brushwood is basically havels in this game, right?
[6:14:18] <%Order_of_Mystery> @PatStaresAt did you beat Old Monk this stream or last stream? I missed your fight D:
[6:14:20] <%moogleboy1984> Is that set from Plague Valley still female only?
[6:14:37] <RubberFistFight> @ScreamLord fucking Hastur
[6:14:58] <Fefe41> Old monk fights were the best times
[6:15:01] <%sirthomas2step> oof
[6:15:05] <%Order_of_Mystery> and that's the only way to get the crown?
[6:15:06] <%sirthomas2step> poor guy
[6:15:10] <CrimsonFox777> Kill poor fools for sweet hats.
[6:15:22] <$Timesteel> yup
[6:15:23] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> I feel so bad, I legit 1 hit a guy as the Old Monk
[6:15:29] <+Hick12> The true souls PvP experience.
[6:15:33] <Sunstalker> Why would you make extra jumps? LUL
[6:15:40] <Zackor1120> Reminds me of getting to the Replica dream in bloodborne
[6:15:46] <pth88> this was very fucky on ps3
[6:15:47] <neraren> Better camera helps
[6:15:51] <%Monkeyweed21> uwu
[6:15:53] <alwayspronking> Clap
[6:15:55] <+TheBitingIrish> YE
[6:15:56] <%sirthomas2step> the pvp experience is like the anime teleport to me
[6:15:58] <%Order_of_Mystery> Lucky Ted in 2020!

[6:16:04] <%za7az> PogChamp
[6:16:12] <%tusk102> lmao
[6:16:12] <Fefe41> first try
[6:16:14] <alwayspronking> That's fair
[6:16:17] <moonmintparadise> Crazytalk
[6:16:25] <%DedlokPM> Why couldn't you get on that 2nd beam from the part right next to the stairs?
[6:16:32] <boardscanada> I can tell you played this game a shit ton
[6:16:35] <TheNewJapanGuy> otgFail otgFail otgFail
[6:16:35] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Nailed it
[6:16:36] <%sirthomas2step> caroming down cliff "this is fine"
[6:16:40] <MonstarGrrrl> [he does care]
[6:16:52] <Sunstalker> If Binded is male now, Garl's shit better be female too.
[6:16:55] <%T_Sasquatch> @patstaresat have you gotten used to the haptic feedback or does it get old
[6:16:56] <+Hick12> He care big
[6:17:21] <islandoasis> it is i, carl finland
[6:17:25] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> Btw if anyone is pvping and you see a Blueblood Sword watch out, there’s a glitch to instantly get max Luck right now
[6:17:43] <boardscanada> that sounds awesome - can't wait to experience it
[6:17:48] <RubberFistFight> i was blown away by the opening scene of Spiderman Miles Morales, because when the train slows down you can feel it going over the clunky spots on the track
[6:17:54] <RubberFistFight> and it feels like what it does IRL
[6:17:58] <boardscanada> so even if you played the original to death, playing this again will be a whole new experience?
[6:18:00] <RubberFistFight> but through your fingers
[6:18:03] <RubberFistFight> it's so fucking dope
[6:18:03] <alwayspronking> The lizard comes back??
[6:18:04] <islandoasis> oh, can you farm the same lizard over again?
[6:18:05] <%sirthomas2step> i just want to smell a ps5
[6:18:13] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt gonna go pure black?
[6:18:16] <islandoasis> or did lizard spawning have some new wierd rules
[6:18:19] <rbakervv> why is he killing himself?
[6:18:22] <%sirthomas2step> just smell
[6:18:25] <+CapnClassix> @islandoasis Every boss kill is another respawn
[6:18:26] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Oh farm time
[6:18:35] <+twohitgood> the respawns stack?
[6:18:42] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> When you buff your weapon the controller vibrates slightly and it feels like the controller itself is glowing, it’s really cool
[6:18:46] <islandoasis> @CapnClassix they stack up?
[6:18:47] <+twohitgood> no wonder why that confused me so much.
[6:18:48] <%T_Sasquatch> I need to feel the controller
[6:18:58] <+CapnClassix> @islandoasis Yep.
[6:18:59] <%Agami23> yeah, respawn stacks with every boss kill so you dont miss out on drops by accident
[6:19:01] <%tusk102> @rbakervv the loading is so fast that dying is faster to get back to wher eyou were
[6:19:08] <islandoasis> nice
[6:19:14] <%sirthomas2step> im gonna take mine out to candlelight dinner like plankton
[6:19:15] <+CapnClassix> @islandoasis Used to be if it ran off a cliff, it counted as a respawn but they fixed it
[6:19:33] <+DeltascapeV4> The good good
[6:19:36] <Badgerconda_> big good
[6:19:36] <%sirthomas2step> can y'all smell the virgin on me?
[6:19:38] <boardscanada> this remake really saved the PS5 launch
[6:19:41] <OuijaTears> good
[6:19:42] <islandoasis> thats nice, lizards caused so much pain and stress in the og
[6:19:42] <IndoorSitup> Yeah they sanded the soul too.
[6:19:53] <+twohitgood> yeah, this seems so much better. i've been playing DeS on RPCS3 and man...i can't awit to get PS5 and play the remake.
[6:19:55] <boardscanada> imagine if you only had miles morales and nothing else - would have been so much less hype
[6:19:58] <%Monkeyweed21> Congrats Des is isnt terrible anymore
[6:20:04] <+CapnClassix> Especially if you were platinum hunting. Good lord
[6:20:23] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Armed and dangerous.
[6:20:29] <+twohitgood> RPCS3 loads about as fast as remake, btw.
[6:20:31] <boardscanada> hopefully online/pvp lasts a while
[6:20:34] <islandoasis> i really loved demons souls, but i was really bad at it.
[6:20:36] <%sirthomas2step> I just want cyberpunk to quit pulling the psyche on me
[6:20:40] <IminyourBase> yeah hobo gloves
[6:20:42] <%tusk102> @boardscanada dmc5:SE?
[6:20:48] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> I can’t believe they kept the Cursed Weapon exploit with Beast talisman, so many builds saved
[6:20:48] <boardscanada> RPCS3 load times are very fast yeah although there are some frame drops here and there in areas
[6:20:59] <boardscanada> @tusk102 yeah I'm going to buy that too once my PS5 arrives next week
[6:20:59] <IminyourBase> HOBO GLOVES
[6:20:59] <+TheBitingIrish> Black
[6:21:05] <+TheBitingIrish> aw
[6:21:21] <+twohitgood> it's hard to see in soul form.
[6:21:32] <IminyourBase> you can't see the difference but you know the difference
[6:21:37] <MonstarGrrrl> is pat cosplaying plague ?
[6:21:39] <boardscanada> @tusk102 will be mainly demons' souls, DMC5 SE and Nioh 2 at 4K 60fps for me - will be enough to keep me busy
[6:21:44] <islandoasis> u hav a hart of guld
[6:21:45] <IndoorSitup> Wonder how much Sony had to force the devs to crunch for this game so it can release on launch.
[6:21:57] <RubberFistFight> i love how Ed just fucking gripes at you every time you leave
[6:22:07] <RubberFistFight> like "YEAH FUCK YA THEN I DIDN'T WANT YOUR SOULS ANYWAY please come back"
[6:22:10] <boardscanada> I think they probably had it near to completion except before it was a PS4 game and it got moved to PS5
[6:22:22] <IndoorSitup> I've heard whispers that this game was not fun to work on.
[6:22:23] <IminyourBase> support dog with orb
[6:22:28] <%sirthomas2step> like deus ex merchants
[6:22:32] <IndoorSitup> The remake i mean
[6:22:38] <%sirthomas2step> @patstaresat awwww yeah
[6:22:46] <%tusk102> @IndoorSitup it's likely that they've been working on it since collosus remake
[6:22:51] <boardscanada> dunno - the original was also not fun to work on - Sony abandoned it near the end
[6:22:56] <%sirthomas2step> that new puppy smell
[6:22:57] <islandoasis> ur pupper is very quiet.
[6:23:02] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Pat this stream: That’s gonna be my items for the whole game! / Pat the very next stream: So I did a little grinding offscreen...
[6:23:09] <Skelex> my dog has serious good dog smell, I bury my face in that tum tum all the time
[6:23:09] <boardscanada> it was considered a failed project until Miyazaki retooled it
[6:23:17] <+Grayhammatter> that new pupper smell
[6:23:17] <ScreamLord> Ostrava is such a huge loser
[6:23:18] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt does gief still have puppy breath or has it gone now
[6:23:21] <Fefe41> Would you rather live in Latria or Valley
[6:23:44] <%sirthomas2step> id get a time share in raccoon city
[6:23:49] <%sirthomas2step> weekend of
[6:23:49] <IndoorSitup> From what I hear, Sony has a bad habit of forcing their devs to crunch all for the sake of graphical fidelity and just overall presentation.
[6:23:54] <islandoasis> latria
[6:23:57] <%MaxeusTheFirst> King Danger Dolan.
[6:24:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Soul Edge and Soul Calibur
[6:24:13] <$Timesteel> you get the key right before Allant
[6:24:13] <+twohitgood> they changed his name!!
[6:24:17] <boardscanada> INdoorSitup - they didn't even want this game for PS3 - Yoshida played it and called the game crap, and then gave up on publishing it in the west
[6:24:20] <blue8moon> Dudes once upon a time
[6:24:22] <%greasypete00> the penetrator Kappa
[6:24:28] <+twohitgood> metas' name was originally "metas knight of the lance"
[6:24:29] <PkSilent01> It is just Soul Edge and Soul Caliber
[6:24:33] <boardscanada> From Software had to go to Atlus to publish it in the US, and namco bandai for europe
[6:24:36] <+CapnClassix> You don't get the key yet
[6:24:39] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt is the soulsBorne world the worst world to live in? if it's not demons, it's undead or eldritch monstrosities.
[6:24:41] <+CapnClassix> Right before you fight King allant
[6:24:45] <+CapnClassix> or you know
[6:24:48] <%sirthomas2step> demons aren't necessarily evil in DeS??
[6:24:48] <+CapnClassix> Kill Ostrava
[6:24:55] <islandoasis> you can cordon off a room in latria at least, valley you are likely to get super covid aids
[6:24:56] <+twohitgood> they totally changed his name to penetrator, lol.
[6:25:09] <rjhascancer> Patch?
[6:25:12] <+twohitgood> why not call oolan "phalanx oolan" then?
[6:25:18] <supergoblinpunch> Patches?
[6:25:27] <IndoorSitup> @boardscanada And now that Souls games are popular as fuck they suddenly treat this game like it was a masterpeice and that it is a valuable part of Playstation history
[6:25:27] <sonicblade38> @sirthomas2step they 100% eat people bout as evil as a hungry bear
[6:25:29] <%Order_of_Mystery> @PatStaresAt seems like you need to kill Penetrator before Ostrava gives you Dolan's key
[6:25:30] <%VashyronM> demons are evil, regardless of their intentions, they are aiding the old one.
[6:25:31] <%WackyGear> @sirthomas2step I'm just saying something crazy is always going on
[6:25:38] <%king_wragles> That's a gun spell
[6:25:41] <%Agami23> oh these guys look fucking cool now
[6:25:43] <+Grayhammatter> EZ
[6:25:44] <+twohitgood> ganked him.
[6:25:48] <islandoasis> omg i forgot this bullshit place
[6:25:51] <boardscanada> @IndoorSitup yeah that's the rather shitty part of it - and it also goes to show that execs often times don't know shit about what can sell
[6:25:52] <+HimeHimeMusic> lmao okay this part is still the same
[6:25:55] <+HimeHimeMusic> just grinding this area
[6:26:02] <%sirthomas2step> okay. gotcha only good demon is a dead one
[6:26:05] <%Daniel_Is_I> I see why basically all future Souls games force you to stand still while casting
[6:26:14] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[6:26:15] <medril07> gun mod?
[6:26:16] <%AzureGale> Pew pew pew
[6:26:19] <ScreamLord> Black Katana SKELETON WARRIOR
[6:26:27] <boardscanada> does this 'skip' still work?
[6:26:28] <%sirthomas2step> ugh the gun mods
[6:26:32] <+Grayhammatter> fire GUN
[6:26:35] <islandoasis> @Daniel_Is_I yeah i saw pat dodge casting and shit
[6:26:39] <Fefe41> No pure bladestone time to sudoku
[6:26:41] <islandoasis> its crazy good now
[6:26:45] <KngJester> bring a blicky into demonsouls and you become a god
[6:26:46] <sonicblade38> @Daniel_Is_I u couldnt move whiel casting in OG demons
[6:26:50] <%sirthomas2step> thats like pulling a glock out if you were in a karate tournament
[6:26:56] <%VashyronM> god, magic looks and sounds so good in this game
[6:26:57] <+twohitgood> prod got pure bladestone from that ninja skele.
[6:27:00] <IminyourBase> bullying the game with your spells and cantrips
[6:27:13] <%AzureGale> ded
[6:27:16] <medril07> why'd you do that?
[6:27:28] <islandoasis> >pure white tendency >white bow
[6:27:35] <Fefe41> Normal pure bladestone grind
[6:27:37] <+twohitgood> i think they increased the drop rate of the pure stones.
[6:27:38] <%juxtest> Alas what a tragic misadventure
[6:27:38] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt why is sony so against fromsoft games going to pc?
[6:28:00] <%Nomenanza> boy they made his shades much spookier
[6:28:00] <+Toastydood> does that work irl Pat?
[6:28:03] <%SirKeigan> When did you switch to Demon's Souls?
[6:28:08] <%Maids4lyfe> what fire spell is that?
[6:28:15] <boardscanada> @tusk102 I think it's the Sony Japan side of the organization - they know these kinds of games being exclusive helps shift consoles , it's sucky but it works
[6:28:19] <%T_Sasquatch> Gun
[6:28:24] <%sirthomas2step> that. is. awesome
[6:28:25] <islandoasis> that barely affected ur mana
[6:28:31] <Fefe41> If they hadn't changed the drop rates I'd put the over/under at 200 runs
[6:28:32] <%SirKeigan> What worlds did he beat today?
[6:28:33] <%Maids4lyfe> thanks!
[6:28:54] <%tusk102> @boardscanada yea but it also seems to get constant bad pr too. and it also seems to be fromsoft games mostly
[6:29:11] <boardscanada> look at how long it took for Atlus to want to port their games to PC, they had to be basically forced by Sega into doing a port for Persona 4, these Japanese companies just are horribly out of touch with PC gaming
[6:29:13] <+StingtheKing> Evenin', y'all.
[6:29:14] <moonmintparadise> How is Peach doing ?
[6:29:15] <%tusk102> please i just want pc bloodborne

[6:30:55] <IndoorSitup> I know a few folks in the industry and from what I've heard Sony owned developers have a bad reputation for essentially bring run like sweatshopa. It's crunch city.
[6:30:58] <TheNewJapanGuy> otgLeet otgLeet
[6:30:58] <RubberFistFight> i can't remember which game it is, but i love when he kicks you down and goes "THIS IS WHAT I DO, MY FRIEND!"

[6:34:59] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt is irina the only dark souls faith teacher who isn't a fuckin asshole?
[6:35:06] <%T_Sasquatch> He actually sells good stuff apparently
[6:35:07] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt he does, i met him there first on my playthrough
[6:35:28] <%sirthomas2step> they gave patches more life than i allowed him to have
[6:35:31] <+Jrockoni> was the adjudicator's theme still good?
[6:35:36] <%hax_metatron> He also shows up in Nexus now btw
[6:35:51] <passione13> I fell asleep to yakuza now demon souls weird transition

[6:36:53] <%hax_metatron> Second Chance tho
[6:36:53] <IminyourBase> they can suck your own ass?
[6:36:54] <rjhascancer> Cure is pretty useful
[6:36:59] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Umbassa corner
[6:37:00] <%T_Sasquatch> Religion amirite
[6:37:04] <%Breaknoon> yurt will deal with patches
[6:37:06] <%sirthomas2step> this is the cool side of the nexus??
[6:37:06] <%Order_of_Mystery> dragon soul can't be used for anything sadly
[6:37:07] <%tusk102> @TurtlesAndTentacles probably more religion in games since the universally seem to be pedantic assholes
[6:37:13] <+CapnClassix> what are good miracles for faith build?
[6:37:14] <+twohitgood> i do like how it's so neatly split. mircles all on one side, spells all on the other.
[6:37:18] <oozebear> religion's for fools, eh? fools and liberals!
[6:37:28] <islandoasis> warth of god i imagine
[6:37:31] <%Order_of_Mystery> umbasa corner, where all the priests gather around and huff their own farts
[6:37:32] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @tusk102 Well thats not Cash Money
[6:37:33] <islandoasis> like before
[6:37:45] <+Cacti_Israphe> Is this your favorite armored core?
[6:37:48] <%tusk102> @TurtlesAndTentacles and yet true
[6:37:58] <Sunstalker> Idk, pat. garl's a cleric and he's pretty baller.
[6:38:21] <blue8moon> he looks like such a scumbag
[6:38:23] <%sirthomas2step> eat his skin
[6:38:30] <islandoasis> the smelly ring
[6:38:31] <ScreamLord> Look at that shit eating grin
[6:38:32] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @tusk102 So basically like the healing church from Bloodborne
[6:38:37] <$Timesteel> cat ring too later on
[6:38:44] <%Daniel_Is_I> Wait is the only offensive miracle wrath of god?
[6:38:48] <+Jrockoni> why hate on the church. nothings cooler then big baller paladins!
[6:38:52] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> Fucking patches man this remake really amplifies his grossness
[6:38:58] <%hax_metatron> Later he sells Sticky White Stuff too
[6:39:00] <%koolaid_kevster> great merchant EXCELLENT asshole
[6:39:00] <%tusk102> @TurtlesAndTentacles no they're just assholes who think they're better rather than "literally destroyed the world"
[6:39:05] <%DianaTheAscian> 60k
[6:39:10] <highfivesquash> kill patches
[6:39:12] <PettyFunk> Also, fun fact! In spite of how doglike they are, hyenas are actually closer related to big cats than they are to canines :)
[6:39:14] <%juxtest> Finally a reliable supplier of Barbarian Clothes
[6:39:33] <islandoasis> a bunch of pats in a mine
[6:39:38] <+twohitgood> killing patches really isn't worth it in this game. it's just the thief ring drop.
[6:39:44] <%hax_metatron> I used wrath of god in Nexus by mistake and no joke 4 NPCs turned hostile the radius was HUGE
[6:39:53] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> woolieGLORY Lets go! woolieGIRLS
[6:40:00] <+Shacklebox> cause he's dick also
[6:40:05] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @tusk102 Well shit. Very not cash money. Their Phrase reminds me of Umbosa from Zelda
[6:40:06] <highfivesquash> kill patches because he' a DICK
[6:40:12] <islandoasis> metalpocolypse kills you?
[6:40:21] <eco419> pew pew
[6:40:21] <+twohitgood> yeah, the assassination missions are worth running but otherwise it's pointless.
[6:40:23] <+reclines_obesily> also the foe ring which is great for invading
[6:40:23] <%tusk102> @TurtlesAndTentacles you mean Urbosa?
[6:40:31] <%Emperor_Machinus> a cat told us?
[6:40:31] <%sirthomas2step> i can't feed my family with a patches
[6:40:32] <%T_Sasquatch> Urbosa Kreygasm

[6:40:57] <%T_Sasquatch> That was a sick explosion wtf
[6:41:08] <%T_Sasquatch> I've never seen an explosion that good
[6:41:23] <%Breaknoon> sackman
[6:41:27] <+twohitgood> i love how magic kills in this version just erase everyone.
[6:41:29] <%Daniel_Is_I> Three in one spell
[6:41:30] <%sirthomas2step> @t_sasquatch i need a smoke and a pancake after that one
[6:41:33] <%Daniel_Is_I> Jesus
[6:41:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @tusk102 Yes! Im too lazy to look up the spelling lol.
[6:41:43] <%Nomenanza> full of prepare juice
[6:42:04] <%DianaTheAscian> wow
[6:42:06] <+TopTieramisu> you mean the best shortcut
[6:42:10] <%tusk102> @TurtlesAndTentacles how dare you disrespect Urbosa smh
[6:42:11] <DSD24> All of the fall damage?
[6:42:13] <$Timesteel> it's not that bad
[6:42:17] <islandoasis> this is a lie, that cliff should be flooding in bloodstains
[6:42:22] <Sunstalker> Shit's fine on a Blessed build Kreygasm
[6:42:22] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> Raddest shortcut you mean?
[6:42:25] <+TopTieramisu> but it skips a massive level
[6:42:27] <Gieron667> lol pat sweating, this game is piss ez AND you use magic
[6:42:28] <+twohitgood> it's a really stressful platforming shortcut.
[6:42:39] <%Emperor_Machinus> Best shortcut?
[6:42:48] <%moogleboy1984> It's also mandatory for a Pure White and Pure Black interaction
[6:42:50] <%sirthomas2step> sounds like my kinda shortcut
[6:43:00] <islandoasis> the shortcut to launch the game
[6:43:01] <%hax_metatron> @gieron667 LUL
[6:43:03] <Fefe41> When you get killed by Flamelurker hundreds of times you'll eventually learn the shortcut WutFace
[6:43:04] <%Nomenanza> that will probably get patched
[6:43:05] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @tusk102 It's almost 1am cut me some slack! I will ask the goddess of chiseled hotness for forgiveness
[6:43:15] <eco419> oh yeah the luck bug
[6:43:17] <%G_Thunders> As everyone remembers, fans were so happy when bonfires were all over the place
[6:43:18] <Sunstalker> Get that talisman of the beast PogChamp
[6:43:27] <CappuccinoGuil> Apparently, the locked door was opened too
[6:43:31] <+corrosivePaladin> oh i didnt know the gold coin was bugged
[6:43:35] <%tusk102> @TurtlesAndTentacles no forgiveness! no quarter! your hips will be crushed by noon
[6:43:42] <+corrosivePaladin> yea the locked door was opened yesterday
[6:43:52] <%Breaknoon> worms time
[6:43:57] <DSD24> Does anyone else say the spells name whenever you cast it?
[6:43:59] <islandoasis> the locked door leads to lordran
[6:44:00] <+TopTieramisu> they're weak to headshots
[6:44:02] <DSD24> Soul Arrow!
[6:44:02] <%Daniel_Is_I> Their faces are also a weak point
[6:44:02] <rjhascancer> WHAT
[6:44:03] <%Nomenanza> weakspot multiplier ahoy
[6:44:04] <+twohitgood> @PatStaresAt weak to headshots
[6:44:09] <rosemon5001> their mouth holes are
[6:44:12] <+Grayhammatter> their head is just weak
[6:44:16] <%Breaknoon> POOLS CLOSED
[6:44:16] <CappuccinoGuil> MELTED
[6:44:18] <Finaldragoon> @corrosivePaladin if you use a gold coin then go to level up you get infinite luck, thus allowing the Blueblood Sword to one shot anything in the game
[6:44:18] <%juxtest> ow
[6:44:24] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @tusk102 All according to plan HahaThink
[6:44:24] <%Emperor_Machinus> To Izalith!
[6:44:26] <%hax_metatron> EVERYTHIJG is weak to magic
[6:44:28] <rjhascancer> thats a lot of damage!!
[6:44:33] <%DianaTheAscian> wow
[6:44:40] <+corrosivePaladin> thats an amazing bug
[6:44:42] <%tusk102> @corrosivePaladin the coin upgrades your LUCK instead of item discovery, but it makes it makes the level like 10000 and if you talk to maiden and go to your stat screen it perma gets stuck as that level
[6:45:07] <%Nomenanza> that was a headshot too I believe
[6:45:16] <%tusk102> @TurtlesAndTentacles t-this guys playing 4d chess! woolieSHOOK

[6:45:48] <DSD24> No Pat they can't they already remastered it
[6:45:49] <Gieron667> i wish
[6:45:50] <+TopTieramisu> if they do a remake for ds1 but don't fix the second half, i'll be pissed
[6:45:51] <+corrosivePaladin> I would play Ds2 if it looked like this
[6:45:52] <FlamingoJazz> Dragon butts REMASTERED
[6:45:53] <PettyFunk> Dark Souls didn't even need a remake, just a...decent remaster.
[6:45:53] <+CapnClassix> I was MGS1 to get this treatment
[6:45:58] <reasonance> DS2 remake pog
[6:45:58] <%Daniel_Is_I> You mean you don't like 30 dragon butts?
[6:46:00] <%T_Sasquatch> Remake everything.... No new things
[6:46:00] <islandoasis> shadow tower (PS5) WHEN
[6:46:02] <boardscanada> you'd have to get rid of the dragon butts though and finish it up
[6:46:02] <+Jrockoni> DS1 REREMAKE?
[6:46:11] <+CapnClassix> King's Field 5 pls
[6:46:15] <+TheBitingIrish> Big McLarge Hugeshard
[6:46:15] <%hax_metatron> DS1 with this fidelity will break me. It’s already my favorite game of all time Kreygasm
[6:46:22] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> I would definitely play a DS1 remake in this style. That’s my favorite game of all time
[6:46:24] <DSD24> Bed of Chaos REMASTERED
[6:46:25] <$Timesteel> Hanz and Franz
[6:46:26] <%Nomenanza> If that were to be the case, I wish they would collaborate with Fromsoft more to restore content that wasn't finished
[6:46:26] <%Emperor_Machinus> Back up gang
[6:46:29] <DSD24> Its still shit
[6:46:31] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt dark souls 1 remaster (the second one) or dark souls 2 remake with the lighting engine and hitboxes fixed
[6:46:32] <PettyFunk> God when are they gonna remaster Elden Ring :(
[6:46:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> Two big strong bois
[6:46:40] <boardscanada> DS1 is my favorite of the Dark Souls series by far, the level of exploration is still unmatched
[6:46:43] <+Grayhammatter> oh lawd they comin'
[6:46:43] <%sirthomas2step> come on i forgot about the bed of chaos
[6:46:46] <+CapnClassix> I really thought they were gonna add the Ice Giant archstone
[6:46:50] <+TheBitingIrish> Are these the precursors to the Door Brothers?
[6:46:51] <%sirthomas2step> dont remind me of that shit
[6:46:58] <%Nomenanza> remember how DS2 Scholar made a reference to these 2 dudes in the gutter
[6:47:05] <%Nomenanza> for no reason at all
[6:47:08] <+twohitgood> i think any of the npc black phantom invaders will drop it depending on which you encounter first.
[6:47:19] <+TopTieramisu> you need wog for this area
[6:47:20] <boardscanada> I actually like DS2 more than DS3 even though I will fully admit it has very rough edges
[6:47:21] <%hax_metatron> No it has to be Black Phantom Scirvir or BP Satsuki
[6:47:23] <+CapnClassix> the one real use for Wrath of God
[6:47:25] <$Timesteel> they don't despawn forever anymore which is good
[6:47:29] <Fefe41> Strat is just wrath of god it
[6:47:30] <PettyFunk> @boardscanada For the most part I agree, especially early game. Getting the grasp of the maps and understanding the cool intuitive layouts was one of my favorite things.
[6:47:42] <%G_Thunders> Aren’t you supposed to do this with firestorm?
[6:47:45] <islandoasis> wrath of god them
[6:47:48] <+twohitgood> @PatStaresAt how does poison work on the lizards?
[6:47:50] <Klarrann3> If you quit out and come back, will they respawn immediately?
[6:47:51] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt would you prefer another remaster of ds1 or a remake of ds2 with the lighting engine and hitboxes fixed
[6:48:18] <eco419> LuvSign
[6:48:19] <+TopTieramisu> i don't need to play ds2 ever again
[6:48:20] <%tusk102> damn fair
[6:48:22] <%Emperor_Machinus> DS2
[6:48:24] <%superc37> itd prefer a remake of 2 only IF they also fix the shitty bosses and level design
[6:48:32] <CyborgAV> No
[6:48:32] <%king_wragles> Okay, what about Dark Souls 1 re-remake or Dark Souls 2 with a tiny hat?
[6:48:37] <%sirthomas2step> i still need to do this and DS2
[6:48:38] <+twohitgood> it is new. they made pure stones easier to get.
[6:48:41] <roobanguy> fuck all yall ds2 is my favorite
[6:48:42] <boardscanada> I think Dark Souls 2 would have the most potential if they went back to all the ditched concept art and plans
[6:48:45] <%Daniel_Is_I> Look if a DS1 remake had omnidirectional rolling, I'd be IN
[6:48:50] <%tusk102> @superc37 admittedly a lot of the bosses were fucked because of the hitboxes
[6:48:50] <%hax_metatron> You get it from Ostrava quest I believe
[6:48:55] <+TopTieramisu> ds1 was never remade
[6:48:56] <Fefe41> 2 was such a slog to play
[6:48:57] <$Timesteel> pure bladestone drops rates got increased as well no longer a 1 in 10k chance anymore
[6:49:01] <+Jrockoni> just make dark souls1 fromsofts skyrim. Ports forever!
[6:49:08] <%GingaNZ> GingaNZ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! Hey there binky dick boivin, this horrid nickname got me thinking, whats your favorite and least favorite nicknames that have shown up over the years? personally I am a fan of fuccboivin
[6:49:10] <boardscanada> Dark Souls 2 was super ambitious and had great concept art, it was just not fully realized
[6:49:15] <+TheBitingIrish> So what're the chances on Archstone 4 DLC?
[6:49:15] <TheArrow_> the effort spent on remaking ds2 is better spent on literally anything else imo
[6:49:21] <+CapnClassix> Go for them Primeval Demons
[6:49:22] <%patriotrenegade> lol
[6:49:25] <islandoasis> tendency sucks
[6:49:25] <%T_Sasquatch> Ds2 was my first dark souls LUL so i cant hate on it
[6:49:26] <+twohitgood> i'd love to see them do another DS1 in terms of making another souls game that is more of a metroidvania.
[6:49:31] <%Emperor_Machinus> I am of the few who likes DS2 the best of the trilogy
[6:49:33] <+TopTieramisu> you don't just add the ditched ideas for ds2. the game got a new director halfway through for a reason
[6:49:38] <%hax_metatron> DeS:RE2 :: DS1:RE4. And we know the similar ones got great remakes
[6:49:40] <%Order_of_Mystery> nah remake ds1 and fix lost izalith
[6:49:41] <%tusk102> @TheBitingIrish 0
[6:49:51] <+TheBitingIrish> awh doodSad
[6:49:51] <boardscanada> Dark Souls 2 would have been better received if it had been called King's Field orsomething
[6:49:55] <PettyFunk> @Jrockoni I mean, all we really have is one shoddy remaster, and hey I'll defend the Switch version since I like being able to lay in bed and play a great game badly
[6:49:59] <+WingBuffet> DS2 has best lore and areas
[6:50:16] <+TopTieramisu> coughs in frigid outskirts
[6:50:19] <jeffishype> wait does it auto-send stuff to the box now
[6:50:20] <+WingBuffet> even if the world map is a mess due to rush
[6:50:29] <+twohitgood> so good
[6:50:32] <boardscanada> yeah I liked the story of King vendrick and how you could go back in memories and talk to him
[6:50:32] <$Timesteel> Yup it's great
[6:50:38] <+twohitgood> send to storage too stronk
[6:50:40] <%T_Sasquatch> The ds1 "remaster" is so embarassing
[6:50:41] <Zackor1120> Man they did everything right with this game it looks like
[6:50:52] <DSD24> Oh Pat's wearing the Old Monk scarf?
[6:50:56] <TheArrow_> there's not a single aspect of ds2 that i like tbh
[6:51:02] <%hax_metatron> @pettyfunk No joke one of my greatest moments was fighting Ornstein and Smough while a plane was taking off on my Switch
[6:51:03] <$Timesteel> Bearbugs
[6:51:10] <Skelex> tortle
[6:51:14] <%tusk102> @T_Sasquatch what's wrong, don't you like metallic blue textures?
[6:51:15] <blue8moon> all the dark souls games have a lot of great things in them, but they also all have some busted horrible shit
[6:51:15] <%bread_assassin> How'd did Pat get the Monk's Head wrappings already?
[6:51:16] <%king_wragles> MOUTH MOVEMENT
[6:51:22] <%T_Sasquatch> @thebitingirish not even power stance ?
[6:51:26] <+Grayhammatter> bearbugs monkaS
[6:51:27] <boardscanada> even the people who hate DS2 though, you have to admit the DLC was excellent
[6:51:28] <+Jrockoni> @pettyfunk that remaster was pretty recent tho. I can't imagine doing another one of the same game so fast.
[6:51:31] <+WingBuffet> he looks like a round bald tom hardy
[6:51:38] <%G_Thunders> @t_sasquatch being able to NG+ any zone? Power stancing? The DLC areas? None of it?
[6:51:40] <%weissguard> Kappa
[6:51:43] <+twohitgood> the bearbug can kill patches if you get to this spot too late in the game.
[6:51:48] <RubberFistFight> I love how he's literally trying the exact same thing on you despite knowing that he's done it on you once before
[6:51:52] <RubberFistFight> and i mean why wouldn't he
[6:51:53] <RubberFistFight> IT FUCKING WORKS
[6:51:56] <dan_g_v> sounds legit
[6:52:02] <%Emperor_Machinus> Patches what a good man, a trustworthy smile
[6:52:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> I always picture patches with a gotee even though he doesn't have it
[6:52:05] <+vaderxyz1970> He seems trustworthy
[6:52:11] <%Radski5> DS2 was peak PvP. DS1, DS3, and Bloodborne have nothing on it
[6:52:19] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you make him pissy, woolie did this
[6:52:20] <%AFlyingTaco1> Nothing, he just remarks that you're smarter than you look.
[6:52:23] <%king_wragles> he probably just goes and gets the treasure
[6:52:24] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt it explodes and hurts patches but he remains friendly
[6:52:26] <$Timesteel> it explodes and does like 70% damage to patches
[6:52:33] <tuesti> Pah-trick
[6:52:35] <boardscanada> let's see it
[6:52:35] <+twohitgood> he just gets salty about breaking his trap.
[6:52:49] <+Smokebanshee> He deosn't really care
[6:53:00] <boardscanada> the game does seem to have more replay value than I gave it credit for with all this world tendency stuff
[6:53:10] <%AFlyingTaco1> He didn't get pissy when I killed it beforehand, he just said "Huh, you're smarter than you look!"
[6:53:11] <%Radski5> oh no who could have foreseen this bamboozle
[6:53:29] <+Grayhammatter> KABOOM
[6:53:36] <DSD24> He dipped
[6:53:38] <%bevyrage> huh, he totally ditched you
[6:53:42] <+twohitgood> he moves up
[6:53:42] <%ForlornCarton> Yup
[6:53:44] <RubberFistFight> dude you just looked at him
[6:53:44] <%Radski5> See you later idiot.
[6:53:45] <+Shacklebox> he went down the rampyou missed it
[6:53:46] <RubberFistFight> he's up there
[6:53:46] <%rdark_ksu> yeh
[6:53:51] <%tusk102> @AFlyingTaco1 when woolie did it he was like "WHAT HOW DID YOU DO THAT" and refused to say anything else
[6:53:57] <+Shacklebox> up
[6:54:01] <+Jrockoni> KICK HIM
[6:54:03] <+vaderxyz1970> He probably had something to do
[6:54:03] <%Chatterbox1991> KICK HIM
[6:54:09] <+Daidis> huehoohohoo
[6:54:11] <%AFlyingTaco1> Nevermind, that's what he said when I killed it first.
[6:54:15] <brandt_connors> kill him
[6:54:20] <+olive_js> Has pat beaten Visage yet?
[6:54:35] <%T_Sasquatch> Yus
[6:54:37] <%AFlyingTaco1> @PatStaresAt So are you gonna lame it out against the Flamelurker with magic, or fight it legit?
[6:54:38] <Fefe41> Do it you wuss
[6:54:46] <%bevyrage> @olive_js chapters 1 and 3. don't remember if he did chapter 2
[6:54:47] <PettyFunk> I'm kinda sad seeing the amount of flack that BluePoint is getting for this remake. Some questionable decisions, sure. But playing through their PS4 SotC was one of the best experiences I've had with video games in the last decade. It wasn't perfect, but neither was the original (And the HD remaster was a huge fumble), and their remake made me relive my childhood joy. Fuck idk I'm drunk, fight me
[6:54:48] <%Agami23> @olive_js he said he is only doing chapter 1 and 2. he did both
[6:55:02] <boardscanada> is that bug not fixed?
[6:55:10] <Fefe41> Dual wield God's Hand against Flamelurker wen
[6:55:12] <+olive_js> olive_js subscribed with Prime. 
[6:55:28] <%olive_js> got it
[6:55:37] <%king_wragles> If you're looking to actually talk with people hating this port, you're on the wrong stream guy.
[6:55:57] <%AFlyingTaco1> I just rolled in circles using Soul Arrow and had no issues with him. Didn't even know he had an exploit.
[6:56:01] <%hax_metatron> @pettyfunk Chill they’re not getting hate. Games critical success, and a big hit
[6:56:03] <+twohitgood> @PettyFunk i think some of it goes too far. there's some choices i don't agree with but i also recognize it's just petty and the remake is overall fucking amazing.
[6:56:33] <+Grayhammatter> that axe is great
[6:56:33] <%tusk102> i'm patchey man in a patchey gang! livin in a hellhole kickin priests! I love killin, thievin, and extortion, gimme 20 bucks and i'll kick you into an abortion! @PatStaresAt
[6:56:35] <boardscanada> I think it'd be nice if Bluepoint does some updates and gives us some options like original soundtrack option, perhaps alternate HUDs, that kind of stuff
[6:56:36] <+twohitgood> some people are getting pretty bitchy about some of the design changes.
[6:56:40] <RubberFistFight> @PettyFunk nah there really aren't that many people bagging them for it. Just a small group of excessively loud dipshits.
[6:56:41] <%Agami23> i like how the magic causes a weird blue flame effect on enemies and enviroments
[6:56:41] <tuesti> pat stinky
[6:56:46] <%hax_metatron> @pettyfunk Any criticism from long time fans is warranted considering how crazy the Souls fandom is. Bluepoint have. A huge success on their hands because the Souls community will play it anyway. They’re not victims of anything LUL
[6:56:54] <PettyFunk> @hax_metatron Haha I know! Sorry if I was exaggerating. I've just seen a lot of criticism leveled at the studio themselves and I'm endeared to their work
[6:56:57] <+xeros720> aahaha
[6:56:59] <+twohitgood> LUL
[6:56:59] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[6:56:59] <CyborgAV> LUL
[6:57:00] <%T_Sasquatch> Loooooooo
[6:57:00] <+CannonHeroBrett> too close stupid
[6:57:00] <boardscanada> if they could add a mode like in Halo where you can seamlessly switch between original and remake graphics, I think they could shut all the critics up
[6:57:01] <islandoasis> rip
[6:57:04] <%AFlyingTaco1> LUL
[6:57:05] <NitronStreams> F
[6:57:06] <Zackor1120> Wow that range

[6:57:09] <%Radski5> Get shit on imbecile

[6:57:11] <rjhascancer> that aoe is no joke
[6:57:15] <+xeros720> i'm very happy with how that played out
[6:57:17] <Zackor1120> Good thing you put the elevator up
[6:57:18] <%king_wragles> But guys, if he comes onto a pro DES remake stream to fight da h8rs he'll get big clout!

[6:57:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> does poison work?
[6:57:36] <+Jrockoni> @pettyfunk my biggest gripes are some of the soundtrack changes. but even I can admit that I understand they went in a different direction. even if personally I don't think every song needed a god damn choir.
[6:57:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> YOU KILLED PAT
[6:57:47] <%dellakitty> what's with the suicide mind carts
[6:57:54] <boardscanada> the original soundtrack went for more of a low budget horror movie vibe yeah
[6:58:00] <%dellakitty> *mine
[6:58:00] <ArcaneMusic> Sup Minh
[6:58:02] <boardscanada> although part of that was probably also the budget
[6:58:08] <%jennalynnmeowri> 318 raiders from jennalynnmeowri have joined! 
[6:58:09] <%hax_metatron> The soundtrack changes are the absolute worst and can easily be fixed by providing the original OST as an option. RE2 did it and it was fucking great!!!!!!
[6:58:10] <RubberFistFight> @boardscanada they were able to do that with Halo because the "remaster" was literally just new textures over the existing assets, so switching them out in realtime is just turning a texture pack on or off.
[6:58:13] <deuxexgodzilla> pat
[6:58:15] <%king_wragles> @dellakitty I don't know, but they're kinda terrifying
[6:58:17] <PettyFunk> Oh no hot girl raid
[6:58:19] <%juxtest> Slice off a flank of Fat Official
[6:58:21] <DSD24> Fool's Idol on PS3 was so good
[6:58:25] <%dellakitty> lol
[6:58:30] <RubberFistFight> @hax_metatron there's nothing wrong with the soundtrack though.
[6:58:30] <deuxexgodzilla> Ooh pretty flower
[6:58:31] <%G_Thunders> The original soundtrack was low budget as hell. I get the appeal but you can’t pretend they WANTED it to sound so cheap given the option
[6:58:33] <%AFlyingTaco1> Even Peeve agrees that the game is phenomenal
[6:58:35] <boardscanada> @RubberFistFight well based on what they said in teh DF video, this game is kinda like that too - the original code is still running on a thread
[6:58:38] <+Sycada> Oh neat I was already following the king goblin
[6:58:42] <+twohitgood> i wish they still had original phalanx boss music. it's less grim and more triumphant...which makes it more darkly ironic.
[6:58:43] <%king_wragles> Pat! Girls are watching! (at least one lul, hey people)

[6:58:44] <PettyFunk> @Jrockoni Ooooh that's a good point. I like how goofy the original DeS soundtrack feels esp in contrast to the more conventional later Souls series orchestral stuff
[6:58:48] <%T_Sasquatch> Jennalynn .... The por..
[6:58:56] <boardscanada> it's the original code that is running on one thread with all the Bluepoint 'remake' stuff on another thread

[6:59:13] <RubberFistFight> @boardscanada probably the original physics engine code, but the assets, the models, the rigs, the ingame objects etc are all new.
[6:59:16] <%king_wragles> they raided too, Pat
[6:59:22] <boardscanada> so I think they could probably implement an original/remake toggle
[6:59:26] <PettyFunk> @Jrockoni I know it's a meme but I love how Banjo Kazooie the Adjudicator theme sounds :)
[6:59:26] <Zackor1120> Or can you?
[6:59:26] <+twohitgood> luckyyy
[6:59:27] <%SpaghettiTime44> @jennalynnmeowri look at your regular eye

[6:59:35] <Zackor1120> Crazy talk activates
[6:59:35] <%hax_metatron> @g_thunders this was debunked on a Twitter thread recently. They did hire an orchestra for the original, it was all intentional and done by chamber musicians and members of Japanese psych rock bands. That’s why the original sounded like it did.
[6:59:37] <eco419> Crazy Talk
[6:59:37] <+twohitgood> i saw you pucker
[6:59:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> PURE SKILL (luck is a skill)

[6:59:46] <%Radski5> @rubberfistfight It didn't help that the "original" textures were noticeably worse than their Xbox counterparts, specifically for reflections and reflections.
[6:59:46] <%Divryne> Brain smol luck big.
[6:59:47] <boardscanada> @RubberFistFight yeah but even that would be fine - keep some of the enhancements in 'original' mode that are in the remake like 'send to inventory' but just have original graphics and an option for original music
[6:59:47] <+twohitgood> that was big pucker
[6:59:47] <%king_wragles> Stumble King Pat

[7:00:16] <+Jrockoni> @pettyfunk exactly! some of the new ones are great. but they fucked up tales of old. and I'm worried about what they could have done to adjudicator's theme. it was so menacing!
[7:00:24] <boardscanada> @RubberFistFight objective would just be for these critics to have their cake and eat it, basically go 'here you want original? turn it on or off, here you go'
[7:00:31] <%Radski5> Pat used the singular fold in this brain for that.
[7:00:34] <jeffishype> get ur souls first dunkass
[7:00:36] <RubberFistFight> @boardscanada as far as I understand it though this is a near-top-to-bottom rebuild/remake as opposed to a straight remaster.
[7:00:42] <%hax_metatron> Astraea’s OST change hits the worst for me. The original was so iconic :(
[7:00:44] <%Monkeyweed21> Did Pat do 1-3 or just move on to 2-2?
[7:00:47] <eco419> LUL LUL LUL

[7:01:03] <boardscanada> @RubberFistFight well they did say they reversed the game's source code and that it's the same code running on one thread
[7:01:12] <DSD24> @hax_metatron Feels way too triumphant in this version
[7:01:13] <%tusk102> @Monkeyweed21 last boss he fought was tower knight
[7:01:25] <RubberFistFight> @boardscanada but I agree having a modeswitch would be the only thing that would potentially shut them up. You and I both know that it wouldn't ACTUALLY shut them up though.
[7:01:27] <%SpaghettiTime44> @jennalynnmeowri psaDogchamp psaHoldon psaDab psaWink psaGoblin
[7:01:30] <%Monkeyweed21> @tusk102 thanks
[7:01:48] <+twohitgood> it is heartbreaking
[7:01:49] <%jennalynnmeowri> okay well imma bounce, hope you have a rad stream psaUp psaUp
[7:01:53] <boardscanada> @RubberFistFight true but it would take some of the sting out of the shitposting at least
[7:02:02] <+twohitgood> to see all those lizards and know you can't get them all...unless you're running faith.
[7:02:17] <%king_wragles> I mean, people tell you each time
[7:02:22] <boardscanada> plus it'd be nice to have - RPCS3 is not perfect either in many ways playing this game
[7:02:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> WUUUUAAAGGGGHHHH!!!!
[7:02:36] <%king_wragles> that's fair actually
[7:02:39] <%Bigbossman91> Bigbossman91 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[7:02:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt use my dancing guy as your raid alarm
[7:02:50] <%Maids4lyfe> get nightbot to do it
[7:02:57] <$RealThiele> twitch is stupid tho and then you people with 0 followers raiding
[7:02:57] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you'd think it would give you a ping noise or smth
[7:03:02] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt you can just enable the generic raid alert in streamlabs, i'm sure one of the lovely folks here would make you a custom gif or something for it.
[7:03:08] <PettyFunk> @hax_metatron Also sorry if I sounded like a corporate shill apologist! I totally understand the disconnect many feel :) I feel bad seeing the Souls fans bleeding over into 'SotC was bad (too?)!' because that remake felt really meaningful to me
[7:03:08] <%king_wragles> Watch your own stream as you stream lmao
[7:03:12] <RubberFistFight> It's literally just a toggle.
[7:03:17] <Vaun0x> elmo scream as raid alarm Pog
[7:03:17] <%Radski5> Montreal streamer IGNORANT of new fans, DISREGARDS the GENEROSITY of friends.
[7:03:23] <%AFlyingTaco1> Make it a really, really loud sound effect that scares your shit
[7:03:29] <blue8moon> use a soundclip of paige going Paaattuuhh
[7:03:39] <blue8moon> for your raid notification :p
[7:03:39] <boardscanada> there was a big problem with the Sotc remake though - the facial expressions on the characters were objectively worse and downgraded
[7:03:42] <RubberFistFight> @Radski5 oh i didn't know you wrote headlines for The Quartering Kappa
[7:03:46] <%Order_of_Mystery> Have the Choese rat as your raid alarm, Pat!
[7:03:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RubberFistFight I made pat kid as a joke he can just use that if not I can make some No sympy of the night animation or something like that
[7:04:19] <RubberFistFight> @boardscanada the SotC PS4 remake had some fucking goof-ass broken physics too.
[7:04:19] <+natedrago> that's sick
[7:04:36] <%T_Sasquatch> It makes you FEEL like Demons Souls
[7:04:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> I am tempted to by a ps5 controler just for the ventual pc haptic feedback that might happen
[7:04:43] <Cpt_phantom> I can’t wait to try the controller
[7:04:46] <boardscanada> @RubberFistFight yeah honestly it'd be nice if they went back to that and released a PS5 update - AFAIK there is no way to run that at 4K 60 right now on PS5 - it could totally do it
[7:04:47] <%Radski5> Do it no balls
[7:04:49] <Vaun0x> 4K rumble in action PogChamp
[7:04:52] <%cvp5127> would you guys recommend melee or magic for a first time build?
[7:04:57] <PettyFunk> @boardscanada That's totally true! I felt remake Wander's face and animations didn't capture the same feeling at all. But the world itself felt realized very well, and that's what I fell in love with in the first place.
[7:04:58] <+xeros720> you can just buy the controller
[7:04:58] <+twohitgood> i think there's a path you walk to that.
[7:05:00] <PettyFunk> That and the music.
[7:05:03] <%T_Sasquatch> Melee
[7:05:10] <%DedlokPM> Do it. You won't. sbfpMember
[7:05:12] <RubberFistFight> @boardscanada there's also a screen tearing issue they just haven't fixed for it on the PS4 Pro
[7:05:39] <boardscanada> the world is a big upgrade in many ways, it feels less like a completely empty map like the original, I just wish the main character's face was more emotive like the original, there are all sorts of gestures he does with his face while running that is all gone
[7:06:28] <PettyFunk> @boardscanada I will still never get tired of replaying Phalanx
[7:06:33] <%sirthomas2step> u got zapped
[7:06:38] <boardscanada> @RubberFistFight hmm wonder if PS5 smooths that screen tearing over
[7:06:44] <Cpt_phantom> Dude just hanging out in a demon infested volcano, I can respect that
[7:06:59] <Vaun0x> "I appreciate your existence" is my new favourite backhanded compliment
[7:07:11] <%Radski5> I want to say people are being asinine about the remakes flaws, but I get fucking ornery whenever I remember the abomination that is the Halo CE Anniversary edition, so I have no right.
[7:07:26] <%Monkeyweed21> Are you excited for the Total Warhammer DLC coming? Tree Hitler is about to get a girlfriend to help him commit tax fraud @PatStaresAt
[7:07:46] <%GalacticaPhanto> Fiyah in da Watah. why
[7:07:50] <boardscanada> yeah I didn't even know you could do this - I just assumed you would die in the original
[7:08:26] <RubberFistFight> @Radski5 wasn't that actually BROKEN at launch though? Like, just full of bugs and a complete mess?

[7:11:29] <%Radski5> @rubberfistfight That was The Master Chief Collection, and it was in fact broken for just over 4 years before getting a real overhaul. Halo CEA has a bunch of divergences in the new music and graphics that are, shall I say, extraneous at best. Curb-stopping the original intent at worse. Also it changed the aiming model for the worse and the original graphics look noticeably worse.
[7:11:30] <blue8moon> I was gonna go to bed an hour ago...
[7:11:31] <+TheBitingIrish> You're GAINING viewers, Pat LUL

[7:12:31] <goddomove> how do u like this compared to the original so far?
[7:12:43] <%glgzephyr> Magic is so fucking busted in this game
[7:12:58] <islandoasis> @vampirate1 he was trying to make himself taller
[7:13:03] <blue8moon> and sweet ass animations
[7:13:08] <PettyFunk> Is it the original with Homer Simpson's makeup shotgun
[7:13:14] <%TheShortSwede> it is just 8 here in Sweden so it is quite nice to watch pat at a reasonable time
[7:13:26] <vampirate1> @islandoasis I was 50/50 on that or an attempt at chokejerking
[7:13:27] <DSD24> Its way worse
[7:13:29] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> Harpis cord
[7:13:33] <+DeltascapeV4> tower night old ost is also better than the new one
[7:13:33] <+CapnClassix> Really? That sucks
[7:13:37] <Fefe41> The harpsicord was the soul of that theme
[7:13:38] <+CapnClassix> I loved the Maiden Astrea theme

[7:13:44] <%tusk102> watching pat at 2 am yeyeyey
[7:13:49] <blue8moon> It would be pretty sweet if they made an option to switch back to the original soundtrack

[7:14:10] <+DeltascapeV4> I forgot they exploded
[7:14:22] <TheSphereHunter> I was wondering why the game looked so bright and colorful for you then I remembered I'm playing with the classic blue filter
[7:14:23] <Srthunda> there seems to be a few headscratcher decisions but overall Its great
[7:14:31] <%GalacticaPhanto> @blue8moon which is weird that it wasnt a feature they added
[7:14:33] <DSD24> Or Groose's theme
[7:14:41] <%GalacticaPhanto> Oh hey Suzi
[7:14:44] <CyborgAV> Quality weapons
[7:14:47] <TheSphereHunter> ITS BLUE
[7:14:51] <TheSphereHunter> IT LOOK COOL!
[7:14:55] <%Nomenanza> goofy filters are the best
[7:14:57] <islandoasis> play with a crt filter
[7:15:06] <+shinpete> <3
[7:15:09] <goddomove> Bluepoint really know their shit huh
[7:15:27] <%AFlyingTaco1> The Winter filter does look really good though, especially in the first world
[7:15:28] <%Radski5> Imagine DeS as an obsidian ball with a couple noticeable ugly growths on it and alot of dirt caked on. DeS Remake cleans off the dirt and smooths some of the growths, but also adds some star stickers and splats of white paint that look really ugly.
[7:15:28] <TheSphereHunter> thesph1MistyJoy thesph1MistyJoy thesph1MistyJoy
[7:15:31] <%Nomenanza> mirror mode + some filter fuck arounds might result in a totally fresh experience
[7:15:32] <PettyFunk> BLUE IS BETTA BRUV SWEAR ON ME MUM'S LOIF
[7:15:32] <islandoasis> they are all really good filters tho
[7:15:33] <RubberFistFight> Yeah that aint british Pat
[7:15:33] <%Agami23> never a bad time to mock the british
[7:15:37] <%Garthunox> Bluepoint love their filters, they had some nice filters on the SOTC remake
[7:15:38] <blue8moon> but you're lost
[7:15:40] <%bevyrage> That's the power of BUGSNAX baby~
[7:15:40] <%ShineTheDiamond> He's lost
[7:15:42] <%Jaller101514> I personally think its a nice option to change the filter whenever to fit your mood
[7:15:43] <%T_Sasquatch> I get this weird feeling that an original Bluepoint game would be awful
[7:15:44] <DSD24> Say "directionally challenged" Pat
[7:15:51] <Zackor1120> You're just Tunnely challenged you're not lost
[7:15:55] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt it's always good to mock the british

[7:35:30] <%AFlyingTaco1> @PatStaresAt Have you had any issues with your PS5 or copy of DES, by the way?
[7:36:11] <%T_Sasquatch> Physical LUL
[7:36:26] <+twohitgood> lobos did a hands of god run earlier this week.

[7:36:30] <Vaun0x> hey, had to be copied from somewhere
[7:36:33] <%Maids4lyfe> gonna catch these hands (of god)
[7:36:35] <%Alazull> Let's get physical, physical
[7:36:47] <%ZephynM> So is there a reason why the game is $10 more than prior releases?
[7:36:55] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt You don't want the trophy for beating the Dragon God with them?
[7:37:13] <%AFlyingTaco1> Lobos actually showed up in the number spot for Destroyer of Worlds with the Hands of God in the Pantheon, too.
[7:37:16] <Vaun0x> because money? @zephynm
[7:37:17] <lotusdagoat> @zephynm AAAs are gonna de $70 from now on
[7:37:21] <Gieron667> you guys talking DS1 remake, imagine Bluepoint remaking Bloodborne
[7:37:24] <%AFlyingTaco1> *number one
[7:37:33] <+xeros720> time for dat boi
[7:37:33] <%Alazull> only a little ominous

[7:37:40] <%DianaTheAscian> yeyeye
[7:37:41] <%Agami23> i'd want the front of my house to look like this place
[7:37:51] <%ShineTheDiamond> Gotta squeeze gamers for more money
[7:37:53] <%AFlyingTaco1> I like how the Flamelurker is a DOOM demon now
[7:37:54] <DSD24> This song sounds good
[7:37:54] <%myfaceisapotato> Donkeyh!
[7:37:55] <medril07> hey a nice guy has shown up
[7:38:03] <+TheBitingIrish> Is it?
[7:38:07] <%AFlyingTaco1> LUL
[7:38:08] <%hax_metatron> @gieron667 Bloodborne doesn’t need a remake, just 60 FPS. It’s fine. And also not as good as DS1
[7:38:12] <+twohitgood> particle effect interaction with the magic
[7:38:17] <dagreenpillow> why is pat so op
[7:38:18] <+twohitgood> the magic blows around the embers.
[7:38:19] <%bread_assassin> Flamelurker is a Dark Souls boss in Demon's Souls.
[7:38:23] <+TheBitingIrish> Or is he being facetious?
[7:38:28] <Onamar> lmao flamelurker's pathing is still fucked
[7:38:31] <rjhascancer> let it do its moves
[7:38:32] <lotusdagoat> shit looks like a fucking ghost rider for the ps2 level. just fire and demon shit
[7:38:33] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> woof
[7:38:34] <%PettyFunk> Fug
[7:38:34] <%Alazull> PUNKED
[7:38:36] <+Jrockoni> magic man with a magic plan!
[7:38:37] <%ShineTheDiamond> Wow.
[7:38:37] <+HibbityDoo> just doesnt let up huh
[7:38:38] <%YakumoYomi> AOEs
[7:38:40] <%AFlyingTaco1> LUL LUL LUL
[7:38:42] <dagreenpillow> oh nvm
[7:38:43] <lbrownthedestroyer> Still hits like a truck!
[7:38:44] <%Monkeyweed21> Flamelurker is p easy
[7:38:44] <%DianaTheAscian> oof
[7:38:44] <medril07> to be fair you were on fire
[7:38:44] <Vaun0x> unchanged AI btw
[7:38:45] <+xeros720> you should've just killed it pat
[7:38:51] <Gc478xf> BloodTrail BloodTrail BloodTrail
[7:38:52] <%AFlyingTaco1> Just keep rolling away Pat come on LUL
[7:38:53] <AncyentMarinere> Now that’s a lot of damage
[7:38:57] <+vicar_anat> cheese meets choese
[7:38:58] <Gieron667> @hax_metatron id take both if i could, but DS1 deserves something better than it got
[7:38:59] <NitronStreams> have you tried being less on fire?
[7:39:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Easy Mode is now selectible
[7:39:00] <medril07> good punch
[7:39:03] <%PettyFunk> I have countered your sorceries with PUNCH
[7:39:05] <+xeros720> we know you were showboating!
[7:39:06] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> why can't you just be perfect, Pat, GUH!
[7:39:15] <mattatatatatatatat> you shouldbe done what i wouldve done
[7:39:23] <%ShineTheDiamond> Well, are you not going to kill it?
[7:39:25] <+twohitgood> @Onamar yeah, they didn't change the AI or much of the actual physics or interactions in the game. so any cheese or bugs will most likely still exist to that extent.
[7:39:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> What HOE Muscle wizard
[7:39:28] <%DedlokPM> Just do more damage to it 4Head
[7:39:38] <%Alazull> @patstaresat Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face
[7:39:42] <heyjorchata> psa3guy
[7:39:58] <TheNewJapanGuy> I'LL KILL YOU, Demon Souls and Yakuza are basically the same
[7:40:06] <%ZephynM> Well, I'd hope the games improve if they're going to cost more.
[7:40:15] <%ZephynM> But that's just being optimistic I'd guess
[7:40:18] <%Alazull> and that boy give you a two piece with a biscuit
[7:40:24] <%AFlyingTaco1> I will say the Flamelurker has one of the worst instances of fighting against the camera in the Souls series
[7:40:31] <%PettyFunk> I strongly agree with a point Pat made on a podcast ages ago. Getting punched in the face is a simple rite of passage, and it applies in games too!
[7:40:37] <%ShineTheDiamond> @ZephynM Define improve
[7:40:40] <blue8moon> friendly folks leaving messages to help guide people
[7:41:13] <islandoasis> his name is flamefucker
[7:41:28] <lotusdagoat> you look so bad when you're in phantom form holy shit
[7:41:41] <%ZephynM> @ShineTheDiamond Probably better performance optimization, maybe more content
[7:41:43] <%Alazull> @zephynm would massive improvements to graphics and online play count?
[7:41:47] <%Agami23> its basically just an angry gorilla
[7:41:58] <medril07> way to cheese it
[7:42:00] <%Alazull> Gun gun gun gun
[7:42:01] <%Radski5> Radski5 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Pat, have you finished 13 Sentinels? I got and finished it after the CSB recommend, so thanks for giving me my favorite Sci-Fi story in recent memory. Also, which gen of Sentinels was your favorite? Mine was Gen 3, Natsuno my favorite among them.
[7:42:06] <%ZephynM> @Alazull Sounds like it
[7:42:08] <+twohitgood> nice
[7:42:09] <%Daniel_Is_I> Flamelurker is actually a really cool fight when you don't magic spam him
[7:42:11] <Gieron667> man i hate magic in these games
[7:42:24] <heyjorchata> sickkkk
[7:42:24] <+Bael_Lord_of_End> Found that out the hard way
[7:42:33] <%ZephynM> Just honestly wanted to know what would improve for the extra money. Like are we getting jipped or not
[7:42:34] <%AFlyingTaco1> Red hot kick?
[7:42:47] <%Radski5> This soul is about to get RED HOT
[7:43:02] <%PettyFunk> @Radski5 I am feeling pain because I haven't been able to play much and I'm at like 30% and now it's on sale and I wish I hadn't gone full price 'cause I am a poor boy
[7:43:04] <%Monkeyweed21> SO DIFFICULT HUH
[7:43:05] <%DianaTheAscian> time for our best friend the cliff
[7:43:19] <+chiazam> Did Pat put the colors to Classic?
[7:43:21] <%Radski5> Anyway, WTF is up with world tendency.
[7:43:23] <%Nomenanza> broken sword into blueblood I believe
[7:43:23] <%Alazull> @zephynm I think the 70 price point is just what we're going to see for bigger Sony games I guess
[7:43:24] <%JD_Lars> FIST OF GOD achievement. Kill next boss with Fist of God (final blow only).
[7:43:34] <%Monkeyweed21> hardest boss in the series you were saying?
[7:43:40] <medril07> did you kill yourself for a shortcut?
[7:43:51] <%AFlyingTaco1> @ZephynM Nah, the $10 increase is just bullshit disguised as "But we're gonna use it to pay our devs more!"
[7:43:53] <+TheBitingIrish> Why not spend the souls first?
[7:43:54] <%Radski5> @pettyfunk Just think of it as supporting Vanillaware if nothing else.
[7:43:55] <%ZephynM> I may be naive saying this, but after beating Sekiro a few times this game doesn't look to be difficult
[7:44:04] <%Daniel_Is_I> He killed himself so he wouldn't ruin his World Tendency
[7:44:04] <rosemon5001> soo is it explained in the lore or item descripitons if dragon god is just a demon or a big motherfucking dragon possesed by one?
[7:44:09] <ScreamLord> Why not check out the Fists move set?
[7:44:11] <%Daniel_Is_I> Because World Tendency is a batshit system for crazy people
[7:44:14] <DSD24> Punch fists!
[7:44:17] <+chiazam> @medril07 He killed himself to keep the Tendency at White
[7:44:26] <%PettyFunk> @Radski5 Haha that's fair. It's no use regretting now :) That being said I love what I've seen of the game!!
[7:44:26] <%clintsterlock> psaWrong
[7:44:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Are these actually good?
[7:44:38] <%T_Sasquatch> Do combo !
[7:44:40] <Shemegory> @ZephynM Demon's Souls is definitely the easiest out of the 4 souls games + BB + sekiro
[7:44:40] <%YakumoYomi> @ZephynM Demon's Souls is probably the easiest of the bunch by a significant margin
[7:44:42] <%Nomenanza> does it have a unique backstab or riposte animation I wonder
[7:44:44] <%AFlyingTaco1> Yes
[7:44:45] <islandoasis> i remember the fists not being great
[7:44:46] <+MooseyFate100> This is an Incredible Hulk game now
[7:44:52] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Oh ok XD
[7:44:52] <%Radski5> @zephynm It's easily the least difficult of the Soulsborne SO LONG as you know what your doing. Cause it's also the most obtuse.
[7:44:54] <+twohitgood> they're legitimately terrible.
[7:44:55] <%JD_Lars> You only need the final blow to get the achievement
[7:44:56] <%Monkeyweed21> they are goodish
[7:45:03] <%AFlyingTaco1> If spec'd into properly these can be very good
[7:45:07] <%Order_of_Mystery> I sincerely hope that Elden Ring actually gives us viable fist weapons again. I would love to do an unarmed run of it
[7:45:12] <+twohitgood> lobos' run with them was painful because they did no damage to anything.
[7:45:13] <%YakumoYomi> Fisting time?!
[7:45:15] <+MooseyFate100> Title drop
[7:45:22] <dan_g_v> nice hat
[7:45:46] <%YakumoYomi> @Order_of_Mystery You and me both.
[7:45:49] <+twohitgood> you need to walk away and go back to get him to prompt for the flamelurker soul.
[7:45:54] <+twohitgood> oh there it is.
[7:46:05] <%Radski5> Maybe we were the real demon soul all along.

[7:49:54] <%PettyFunk> I have literally never fought Bed of Chaos without exploits and I'm pretty okay with that.
[7:49:57] <%Alazull> because if it works it would be cool
[7:50:00] <Ottomaani666> it's lore boss
[7:50:03] <%AFlyingTaco1> So for those who don't know, you have to hide behind the pillars and wait for it to look away before moving forward.
[7:50:03] <%JD_Lars> Just the final blow from the mitts to get the achievement. I’d drop them until the last hit
[7:50:03] <%ShineTheDiamond> Would it have been better to make it an actual fight? Or would that be too much of a step away from the old game?
[7:50:04] <Gieron667> yohm the giant says hi
[7:50:07] <Valask> BECAUSE SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS PAT
[7:50:10] <%AFlyingTaco1> It's a pain in the ass.
[7:50:18] <%Radski5> Fucking Ceaseless Discharge
[7:50:30] <rosemon5001> you can slash it
[7:50:33] <+shinpete> Cant you just hit it yourself?
[7:50:35] <%Ynkubus_> You can hit tit too Pat
[7:50:40] <%AFlyingTaco1> You can hit the rubble Pat
[7:50:43] <+chiazam> ummmmm
[7:50:49] <%AFlyingTaco1> Yeah this boss sucks
[7:50:52] <dagreenpillow> *smacks*
[7:50:55] <+shinpete> Yes :)
[7:50:55] <%Maids4lyfe> punch the rubble
[7:50:58] <%Ynkubus_> We are
[7:51:01] <Profmcstevie> Thanks, my mommy says that too
[7:51:03] <+twohitgood> does it have to be the whole area with the fists or just the last part where you hit his chin?
[7:51:03] <%juxtest> bonk
[7:51:06] <+chiazam> noice
[7:51:06] <%Radski5> Yeah hit it for 2 damage Pat
[7:51:07] <tidalwafer> it sucks in 4k now
[7:51:08] <eco419> yup :)
[7:51:09] <%PettyFunk> Why do the work when a nice fire man can do the work for you :)
[7:51:09] <%king_wragles> !uptime
[7:51:09] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 7h 51m.
[7:51:11] <AncyentMarinere> Dragons are cool I guess
[7:51:16] <Fefe41> We're not geniuses, we just got gud
[7:51:35] <Valask> zekeKEK
[7:51:38] <+chiazam> *smacks lips*
[7:51:43] <blue8moon> this is the best
[7:51:44] <Vaun0x> wew
[7:51:47] <+DeltascapeV4> Kinda disappointed they didn't change anything for this fight
[7:51:47] <%T_Sasquatch> Ok wtf is the optimal way to do this ??.
[7:51:48] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[7:51:48] <%Order_of_Mystery> also the run to this boss is like 10 seconds, compared to the several minutes it takes to run back to bed of chaos. dragon god isn't great, but it's leagues better than bed of chaos imo
[7:51:49] <%ShineTheDiamond> Getting better!
[7:51:49] <%Agami23> punch the dragons fist when it swings at you. like an anime
[7:51:50] <%Emperor_Machinus> Killed by dragon pinky
[7:51:55] <%YakumoYomi> Can't you use magic or a two handed weapon to clear the rubble faster/safely?
[7:51:56] <%DianaTheAscian> yup hitting it such a good idea
[7:51:57] <+Jrockoni> maybe. just maybe. juuuust maybe. slow it down a little.
[7:51:57] <+shinpete> LUL
[7:52:04] <%ZephynM> I think this kind of boss fight would make me return the game on account of annoying game design.
[7:52:24] <%Radski5> So this is only better than Bed of Chaos cause it's shorter.
[7:52:26] <DSD24> You can call that a sword
[7:52:26] <+Smokebanshee> the fists dont do shit to the rubble, you just gotta use them on his chin for the trophy
[7:52:28] <+shinpete> Dragon bones are shaking in their boots...
[7:52:35] <Valask> god the sound design of this game is so good
[7:52:35] <+xeros720> a puzzle boss needs a key
[7:52:40] <%ZephynM> LUL
[7:52:40] <%T_Sasquatch> Hahahaha
[7:52:43] <eco419> LUL
[7:52:45] <Berendenn> PAP
[7:52:47] <Vaun0x> LUL
[7:52:49] <+shinpete> Don't get fingered :)
[7:52:50] <%ShineTheDiamond> Same exact spot.
[7:52:51] <+SnapIntoaTimJim> rekt
[7:52:52] <%DianaTheAscian> Pat
[7:52:53] <neraren> Dude patience
[7:52:53] <%juxtest> bonk
[7:52:53] <SoulLink13> yep this was my run too lol
[7:52:53] <%DedlokPM> @T_Sasquatch hit the broken pillar, run back hide behind one of the side pilliars. repeat
[7:52:54] <%AFlyingTaco1> This thing is a pain in the ass
[7:52:54] <+andiwaffles> welcome to bed of chaos 1.0
[7:52:55] <%Maids4lyfe> THUMB TAP
[7:52:57] <$Aitch971> Definition of insanity
[7:52:59] <+chiazam> @PatStaresAt You can hide behind pillars
[7:53:01] <%Ynkubus_> You should ugh pay attention to where its looking too
[7:53:03] <%YakumoYomi> Dragon God was like "OWwww-uh! Bitch!"
[7:53:05] <%DianaTheAscian> thats 3 times the same thing
[7:53:07] <Gieron667> definition of insanity
[7:53:08] <Fefe41> The nail is pretty sharp bruh
[7:53:11] <Valask> his thumbnail then
[7:53:11] <+xeros720> oh yeah, the pillars
[7:53:11] <blue8moon> I believe in you Pat
[7:53:23] <%Radski5> God everytime you get one-hit it's like falling in those pits all over again.
[7:53:24] <Srthunda> one guy
[7:53:24] <%ShineTheDiamond> Nope
[7:53:27] <+xeros720> ahaha, guess not those!
[7:53:27] <+andiwaffles> hahaha
[7:53:27] <Valask> zekeKEK
[7:53:28] <+Jrockoni> did pat forget gow this fight works?
[7:53:28] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> got punk'd
[7:53:29] <eco419> LUL
[7:53:30] <+JoroNope> just parry it
[7:53:30] <ScreamLord> To be fair, that finger nail is the size of your torso
[7:53:34] <%T_Sasquatch> @dedlokpm how did this concept get past testing LUL
[7:53:34] <%ShineTheDiamond> Hahahahahahahaha
[7:53:35] <Vaun0x> ...chat
[7:53:35] <%Maids4lyfe> the pillars don't block shit
[7:53:36] <%transporterthesequel> Good job one guy
[7:53:37] <TheNewJapanGuy> yes but he's a GOD
[7:53:38] <+chiazam> Welp
[7:53:38] <%furiousfurioso> the pillars block his sight, you can hide from him, wait till he looks away, then move
[7:53:38] <%Ynkubus_> Pillars are only good for hiding from sight, not fist
[7:53:38] <%DianaTheAscian> thanks one guy
[7:53:41] <+xeros720> i dunno, run back and forth?
[7:53:43] <%juxtest> Well maybe YOU cant
[7:53:43] <%Noogiez> you can du eeeet
[7:53:44] <Shemegory> I remember the safe spots being way more obvious in the original
[7:53:45] <%T_Sasquatch> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[7:53:45] <+shinpete> This is way harder than flamelurker LUL
[7:53:45] <%AFlyingTaco1> You have to wait until the attack is over, then you can hide behind it
[7:53:46] <+Neoripo> One punch!
[7:53:53] <AncyentMarinere> psaPat
[7:53:55] <%Maids4lyfe> psaWrong
[7:53:55] <%ShineTheDiamond> You got this, Pat!
[7:53:55] <tidalwafer> So this is the best game fromsoft ever made huh
[7:53:57] <Deathmemester> Hide, not avoid damage
[7:53:57] <%Radski5> Just roll through it OH WAIT this is a good souls game.
[7:54:00] <%beepbeepbopbop> At least the loading speeds are fast
[7:54:05] <%DedlokPM> @T_Sasquatch because they got people to complete it
[7:54:31] <%T_Sasquatch> Yea but it's clearly not fun LUL
[7:54:37] <%DedlokPM> @PatStaresAt don't hide next to where is about to punch thp
[7:54:39] <%Monkeyweed21> fake des fan
[7:54:42] <urmom467> monkaW
[7:54:43] <+chiazam> There we go
[7:54:44] <%cephas97> why is pat still awake!!!!!
[7:54:44] <%DianaTheAscian> oh neat
[7:54:52] <%ShineTheDiamond> His eyes blinking in a sequence down his face is pretty cool
[7:54:56] <%Nomenanza> I do like how it blinks
[7:55:02] <%cephas97> its 8 in the morning in the UK WutFace
[7:55:03] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> jeez
[7:55:03] <%MrUnKnownAlien> He looks cool
[7:55:06] <%DedlokPM> @cephas97 because game good
[7:55:08] <+chiazam> I was one guy and I was partially correct
[7:55:09] <Valask> zekeKEK
[7:55:11] <%DianaTheAscian> jeez
[7:55:11] <%Radski5> You love to see it.
[7:55:13] <+shinpete> THE HARDEST BOSS IN THE SOULS SERIES
[7:55:13] <eco419> smack
[7:55:14] <highfivesquash> is pat bad at this game or is this boss hard
[7:55:17] <%ShineTheDiamond> Almost 3AM in EST
[7:55:19] <%Larry_Q> Hahahahahah
[7:55:21] <Profmcstevie> It sure is 8am in the UK lytBORK
[7:55:22] <%Monkeyweed21> at least he looks cool now
[7:55:23] <epicbiomouse> Rolling alerts him
[7:55:27] <Profmcstevie> But I gotta see a dead dragon
[7:55:27] <+xeros720> what's frustrating about this is you can just watch a video and know exactly how to do it
[7:55:28] <eco419> both
[7:55:30] <%Radski5> @highfivesquash This boss is bad.
[7:55:32] <Gieron667> keep doing the same thing ye ye ye
[7:55:34] <%KaiserMario> So this is an easy boss, huh... LUL
[7:55:35] <%AFlyingTaco1> @highfivesquash The boss fight is poorly designed
[7:55:39] <AncyentMarinere> It’s barely 12 in Cali
[7:55:40] <%ShineTheDiamond> Pat's tired and this boss is a bit BS
[7:55:43] <%DedlokPM> @shinpete it's obviously flamelurker cranky5Heh
[7:55:43] <%Alazull> when the day comes that From pulls off the giant puzzle boss I will be so happy
[7:55:57] <%AFlyingTaco1> Like this is the only enemy in the game who you need to watch visual indicators for
[7:55:57] <%PettyFunk> @highfivesquash It's more that any small mistake is a hard failure
[7:55:59] <+andiwaffles> uhh this boss is kinda similar to Bed of Chaos in that it's hard but not traditionally, kinda like a trial and error platformer brand of hard
[7:56:00] <%ShineTheDiamond> He
[7:56:00] <%sighphers> "please"
[7:56:03] <%AFlyingTaco1> And it's terrible
[7:56:06] <%cephas97> omg, game very good
[7:56:07] <rjhascancer> "please" xD
[7:56:08] <%Ynkubus_> The boss could have been a bit bter but player impatience is also an issue
[7:56:10] <%ShineTheDiamond> Tell us
[7:56:12] <+Jrockoni> this is prob the worst boss to try and speedy Gonzalez your way through
[7:56:17] <Profmcstevie> The puzzle is easy and they murder you for being even slightly off?
[7:56:17] <%Alazull> Agreed
[7:56:18] <%Monkeyweed21> @AzureGale they did its called the dragon of the tree in Sekiro
[7:56:19] <%AFlyingTaco1> That too
[7:56:21] <+chiazam> @PatStaresAt also can't you cast at the rubble?
[7:56:21] <%ShineTheDiamond> Yeah. The instant death is BS.
[7:56:24] <%Chatterbox1991> @patstaresat as someone who is not familiar with Demons Souls this boss seems like Bullshit
[7:56:24] <%DianaTheAscian> yes
[7:56:25] <%promessav2> it's usually better to just do part of it and die
[7:56:26] <%Larry_Q> thye're bad
[7:56:26] <+N0bdyNoOne> Where is gief? Clearly the reason we are here
[7:56:28] <%Radski5> Pits, Fists, or Poop.
[7:56:37] <%Monkeyweed21> The Sekiro Puzzle Boss is the best one
[7:56:38] <%Radski5> OH
[7:56:40] <eco419> just get gud 4Head
[7:56:41] <%Alazull> CRAZYTALK
[7:56:41] <+k95zero> CRAZY TALK
[7:56:47] <%PettyFunk> You can totally understand it but a slight misstep means immediate death
[7:56:48] <%Emperor_Machinus> Crazy talk
[7:56:49] <%Radski5> psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhead
[7:56:49] <%UvBenServed> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[7:56:50] <%DianaTheAscian> CRAZY TALK
[7:57:08] <a_mad_dragon> crazy talk is real
[7:57:10] <%DianaTheAscian> I would say clip that but...
[7:57:13] <%Alazull> nah but really though that was a fluke y'all
[7:57:13] <scarthmaheart> Crazy Talk engage
[7:57:13] <+chiazam> Wait isn't Pat WEARING NO ARMOR????
[7:57:14] <%Radski5> That's actually unbelievable.
[7:57:22] <+shinpete> @DedlokPM Never seen a build bully flamelurker like that tbh. This boss is a meme if you have more than 10 vitality LUL
[7:57:23] <+N0bdyNoOne> So wha is this bosses gimmick?
[7:57:37] <%AFlyingTaco1> @chiazam He took it off to use the Dragon Bone Smasher
[7:57:38] <%Maids4lyfe> oh the eyes flash red when it sees you
[7:57:38] <%Radski5> @n0bdynoone He sucks.
[7:57:45] <%ShineTheDiamond> Oooof
[7:57:46] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> wow, that's infuriating.
[7:57:49] <+xeros720> as far as i recall, you hit it once, then run back
[7:57:51] <Profmcstevie> If we're not rolling here, just armour up a bit
[7:57:55] <%DianaTheAscian> that 2nd swing killed u
[7:57:56] <%Noogiez> what if you run back to bait an attack then run foward?
[7:57:57] <%Radski5> It's a good gimmick
[7:58:00] <%Nomenanza> @N0bdyNoOne gotta run to little ballistas and shoot his ass while avoiding his attention
[7:58:00] <+N0bdyNoOne> @Radski5 Step Dragon noooooo
[7:58:02] <+chiazam> I think Pat should wear armor
[7:58:03] <%Monkeyweed21> The dragon in Sekiro is the only good puzzle boss they did
[7:58:05] <%AFlyingTaco1> @N0bdyNoOne You hide behind the pillars, making your way along the wall to a ballista and fire it
[7:58:05] <Fefe41> Bait him to punch that rubble then hide back at the pillar
[7:58:07] <dan_g_v> you need two harpoons to beat him
[7:58:07] <%Emperor_Machinus> @N0bdyNoOne Pat's boss gimmick is that he says stuff and the opposite happens
[7:58:09] <+xeros720> nah, it's a one hit kill unless you're vastly overleveled
[7:58:10] <%Noogiez> or am i a dumbass
[7:58:21] <%AFlyingTaco1> @N0bdyNoOne Then do it again, and then you get to hit it and kill it
[7:58:21] <%ShineTheDiamond> Still alive!
[7:58:25] <+xeros720> huh, i guess not always
[7:58:31] <+xeros720> tis a mystery
[7:58:43] <+shinpete> Ask it ti be gentler :)
[7:58:45] <%DianaTheAscian> y even heal?
[7:58:46] <%cephas97> ask god for help
[7:58:47] <highfivesquash> @PatStaresAt If you mix malic acid and citric acid with monster and add a dash of lemon it becomes -C R A Z Y - D E L I CI O U S-
[7:58:47] <%Alazull> its a mystery
[7:59:10] <+shinpete> What a meme lmao
[7:59:10] <%ShineTheDiamond> How in the world?
[7:59:12] <%T_Sasquatch> Take your time
[7:59:12] <%furiousfurioso> you're going too fast, gotta hit then run back
[7:59:14] <+chiazam> Is mystery
[7:59:14] <eco419> angery
[7:59:14] <+TheBitingIrish> Didn't he have a big vision cone in the original?
[7:59:18] <%AFlyingTaco1> You have to wait longer, I think. But yeah this is a shitty fight.
[7:59:22] <%R3Roundabout> just keep doing the same thing, it's working so well
[7:59:22] <+vicar_anat> No amount of magic cheese can defeat this bad boy
[7:59:22] <%beepbeepbopbop> ????
[7:59:28] <Profmcstevie> Sleep deprivation leads to tunnel visioning :)
[7:59:28] <Gieron667> damn you suck huh
[7:59:30] <rosemon5001> he just wanted to fist pump you bro
[7:59:32] <+shinpete> This boss is honestly so hard if he one hits you monkaS
[7:59:34] <%Piemono> All the frustration of Bed of Chaos too it seems
[7:59:35] <Fefe41> It's the rolling
[7:59:39] <%ShineTheDiamond> You break his stuff. He get grumpy
[7:59:45] <%AFlyingTaco1> Hiding after breaking it might help
[7:59:45] <%Maids4lyfe> no he sees you when you're standing there
[7:59:47] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> of course, he has an appreciation for fine architecture and you're destroying it.
[7:59:47] <neraren> Stay in your hidey spot and shoot arrows at the rubble?
[8:00:02] <+Jrockoni> the ghost of german spy is upset with pats gameplay
[8:00:06] <rjhascancer> so break rubble then runback?
[8:00:06] <+xeros720> his eyes will turn red when he notices something
[8:00:16] <%Radski5> Y'know why FromSoftware puzzle bosses suck? They're the only FromSoftware bosses that can be 100% understood from a single YouTube video.
[8:00:21] <AncyentMarinere> He’s just trying to put the rubble back but you’re in the way
[8:00:32] <%DianaTheAscian> his eyes change color?
[8:00:50] <%T_Sasquatch> @xeros720 nice catch
[8:00:54] <+N0bdyNoOne> Okay that was actually bullshit
[8:00:57] <%Maids4lyfe> yeah they turn red when it sees pat
[8:01:03] <+xeros720> i think that's a new effect, it's neat
[8:01:03] <Zackor1120> Shit boss
[8:01:04] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt he tracks
[8:01:04] <%Chatterbox1991> is it actually unavoidable?
[8:01:07] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah I'm callin bullshit on that too
[8:01:07] <+chiazam> Shoot at the rubble?
[8:01:07] <%ShineTheDiamond> That was crap
[8:01:08] <blue8moon> rude of you dragon god
[8:01:14] <Profmcstevie> He punched your spectre
[8:01:17] <%Alazull> that was some big bullshit
[8:01:18] <%furiousfurioso> you gotta hit it once then turn back, you have to take it really safely it sucks
[8:01:19] <%Emperor_Machinus> @Maids4lyfe Of course he sees a red head
[8:01:19] <rjhascancer> I think you can hide behind that fallen pillar
[8:01:20] <scarthmaheart> Yep. Yellow is looking, red is alert. Like in Metal Gear.
[8:01:21] <%AFlyingTaco1> @Chatterbox1991 Inside the hallways, yes.
[8:01:23] <+shinpete> Dragon god a lag monster monkaS
[8:01:29] <%Maids4lyfe> dragon god uses aim bot
[8:01:29] <AncyentMarinere> Bluepoint should’ve just put a wall that says NO
[8:01:34] <%DianaTheAscian> can u?
[8:01:35] <%Maids4lyfe> @Emperor_Machinus LUL
[8:01:40] <%AFlyingTaco1> @Chatterbox1991 You can only avoid his attacks when out in the more open areas
[8:01:44] <eco419> LUL LUL
[8:01:46] <%Radski5> Tactical Souls Action
[8:01:55] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> hah
[8:01:58] <%Piemono> Gods truly are mysterious
[8:01:59] <%DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[8:02:01] <BuffaTV> that seems like a bug lol
[8:02:01] <%Monkeyweed21> There's literally 1 good puzzle boss in the entire series and its the Divine Dragon in Sekiro cuz its not a 1 shot
[8:02:03] <@Pandora_Prime> >:|

[8:02:09] <rjhascancer> I think you can hide behind that fallen pillar
[8:02:12] <%Alazull> you may be a dragon god but you're also just one big ol bitch
[8:02:13] <%Maids4lyfe> the giant rock
[8:02:16] <+xeros720> yeah, divine dragon is super rad
[8:02:16] <%AFlyingTaco1> You're gonna need some aged spice for this if you want to use magic
[8:02:17] <%furiousfurioso> yes it is
[8:02:18] <%juxtest> Magic wins again
[8:02:21] <neraren> It is there
[8:02:22] <MonstarGrrrl> StinkyCheese

[8:02:26] <Fefe41> It was there
[8:02:30] <%Monkeyweed21> stop running when he's looking in that direction @PatStaresAt
[8:02:30] <eco419> but it is
[8:02:31] <+andiwaffles> it's all giant rocks!
[8:02:31] <%Maids4lyfe> YOU'RE JUST TAKING TOO LONG
[8:02:31] <neraren> He sees you when you run out
[8:02:32] <%ShineTheDiamond> If he's supposed to look away, he doesn't do it often
[8:02:34] <%AFlyingTaco1> Yeah, it's dumb as fuck, but somehow he can't see you there.
[8:02:35] <%Maids4lyfe> fuck
[8:02:36] <SoulLink13> puzzle boss, wrecking your day one misstep at a time
[8:02:36] <%beepbeepbopbop> That's the one
[8:02:38] <%furiousfurioso> his eyes are turning red because he sees you go between the spots, if you wait he'll calm down

[8:17:31] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Omg pat why u still up for fucks sakes
[8:17:34] <Deathmemester> there wasn't a set in the original it was just the hat, but there's guaranteed drops from specific ones
[8:17:36] <blue8moon> I believe it used to be just the hat before, but now you need a whoel outfit
[8:17:51] <hadokenforyou> do you get the whole set in 1-3?
[8:17:57] <hadokenforyou> if so then its cool
[8:18:04] <+Joe2187> each unique fat official drops in certain areas
[8:18:07] <+twohitgood> full set is new to the remake. not sure about drop rates. seems like a guaranteed drop from different fat ministers, though?
[8:18:13] <+Joe2187> they're 100% drops off certain ones
[8:18:15] <%Ixiah> drop your dagger pat Kappa
[8:18:15] <hadokenforyou> basically as long as you dont have to farm for it
