[0:07:05] <%xXVeggiePLusXx> More Borderlands than Destiny
[0:07:09] <+mcburgers3000> The orb has become the abyss

[0:09:01] <%JoshManVGH> You know how in FFXIV, you get abilities with two or more stocks? and each stock cooldown in sequence?

[0:09:04] <%X2Eliah> That should go well

[0:24:32] <Ipsenscastle> Kenshi was more stable than Outriders
[0:24:32] <Lodestarrobot> I don't have a bad opinion of kenshi i just like to think the spirit of the game attacks pat specifically
[0:24:32] <UncleAndross_> try clapping your hands - that might fix it
[0:24:42] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You must be at least 64 inches tall to play
[0:24:44] <%Arancet> @PatStaresAt when that showed up i had to ctrl alt del to kill the report client proc to get steam to start it again

[0:33:29] <lil_drummer2552> What's he think of the game so far?
[0:33:38] <%valriot> @Pequod1 Could do that in Andromeda too. Andromeda has issues but man it plays really well
[0:33:43] <%Mendin> @ReallyBigRocks Probably either "Hiding your real face behind it" or "homosexuals are effeminate and the beard is the sign of  masculine virility"
[0:33:44] <%arcielardor> So the ring was an April Fool's joke on his beloved Eli?
[0:33:49] <T_Sasquatch> omg i forgot world tiers LUL that explains alot
[0:33:56] <TopTierHarley> @RoyDaren I'm on tier 6 and it's fucking hard, especially solo

[0:34:23] <Laecerelius> Dat splorch
[0:34:31] <T_Sasquatch> its more hard in the sense that im not doing any damage
[0:34:45] <splicerss> This game good? OR just kinda ok
[0:34:57] <lil_drummer2552> I'm on world tier 7 solo and haven't had any issues really.
[0:35:01] <T_Sasquatch> ok,not 60 imo
[0:35:10] <%X2Eliah> @splicerss It's REALLY hard to tell
[0:35:19] <splicerss> yea thats what I figured lol
[0:35:21] <%FunkyStreams> the armored guys drop them when they die.
[0:35:27] <splicerss> its not open world right?
[0:35:28] <%FunkyStreams> and it fuckin sucks.
[0:35:31] <+babushkakoi> Cute that they're playing together but streaming separately. Nice to see the duo perspective
[0:35:37] <%Mendin> Pat's techromancer is nominally a long-range class with a turret, artillery fire, and sniper rifle based perks, but you can easily go faceroll with your grenade, the turret as a decoy, and Venom Rounds i nlike a shotgun or SMG
[0:35:39] <+RoyDaren> do the enemy not use cover? xD they dont seem to care
[0:35:44] <%FunkyStreams> @splicerss it has a world, yes.
[0:35:56] <%X2Eliah> So this is basically a co-op / online game right? no solo mode?
[0:36:06] <%Mendin> It's soloable too
[0:36:12] <T_Sasquatch> cover is a suggestion , a suggestion that barely matters
[0:36:22] <TopTierHarley> my only problem is that reload takes forever
[0:36:26] <$D4C_Trice> I can't hear Eli over the guns
[0:36:38] <SLingard1999> @x2eliah theres solo
[0:36:52] <+RoyDaren> this game should have added active reload :O
[0:37:01] <jumpyhugs> did pat just put down a grenade sprinkler?
[0:37:09] <+ALazo> I want to hear Eli's life advice
[0:37:10] <+ikantreeed> Eli shouldn't be heard only SEEN!!!!
[0:37:13] <%X2Eliah> Eli said "this game has really good sound design" and all I can hear are gun sounds
[0:37:26] <%FunkyStreams> @RoyDaren I think they were afraid to take anymore from Gears.
[0:37:29] <%Mendin> "THE FLAME WILL PASS, FOCUS BOY" - Kratos, Dad of War, 2018
[0:37:51] <%Kingkaiju0618> Is this game good? or does it feel like it will turn into what destiny has become
[0:38:05] <$D4C_Trice> there isn't a reduce gun noise in the game unfortunately
[0:38:13] <+RoyDaren> @FunkyStreams they should take what makes stuff fun regardless imo xD
[0:38:14] <T_Sasquatch> you heal when withing range of enemies which is kinda bizzare
[0:38:21] <%kknutson4> I hope they do co-op in Remnant: From the Ashes too
[0:38:21] <ittla> walk up behind their cover and shoot em like you're the ai in mass effect
[0:38:24] <%X2Eliah> Ohhhh.. So the guns are always at 100%?
[0:38:27] <%the22cstomp> afaik there's a hard end to the game so it's not like destiny
[0:39:03] <%FunkyStreams> @PatStaresAt  your cryo turret is a get out jail free card btw.
[0:39:06] <+bittahjuri> yo pat
[0:39:08] <$D4C_Trice> @the22cstomp and unlike destiny the stuff you do is rewarding
[0:39:13] <MartiusGW> i am not sure if there will be dlc/expansions?
[0:39:20] <%Mendin> hard end to the story but then you can grind Expeditions which are maybe like monster hunter exploration quests?
[0:39:36] <%the22cstomp> if it does  well enough i would assume it will have dlc/expacs ala borderlands
[0:39:51] <TopTierHarley> Pat's health is so low
[0:39:52] <%Mendin> They said the game is released as "complete" and DLC/Expansions will only occur if sales merit them, it's not intended as a GaS
[0:40:16] <%X2Eliah> ..... jesus. These "increase x by 5%" "upgrades" are terrible
[0:40:30] <%linSP> Hey guys is this better than destiny
[0:40:31] <T_Sasquatch> they didnt market it well tbh , i thought it was gaas for so long
[0:40:32] <%X2Eliah> Paige is the leader
[0:40:34] <%Mendin> Pat's class has omnivamp for all damage dealt which stacks up
[0:40:35] <%X2Eliah> Paige should lead
[0:40:47] <MartiusGW> well, its selling well on steam
[0:40:49] <%FunkyStreams> most of them are moddest 6% upgrades, I'll have you know.
[0:41:09] <MartiusGW> probably better than avengers which is hilarious
[0:41:17] <%valriot> Pop a squat to asset dominance
[0:41:18] <%X2Eliah> That capture thing was soooo dragon age inquisition
[0:41:21] <+PunishedCoviello> This looks so generic.

[0:41:58] <T_Sasquatch> imagine making an avengers game and somehow screwing that up
[0:42:00] <sightlesspoem> looks super destiny
[0:42:06] <%Xelhesia> looks like the tree where Guts was born
[0:42:15] <%the22cstomp> bless you pat

[0:42:20] <%X2Eliah> Okay, mining rocks like in Inquisition

[0:51:24] <+b_aleph> oooohhh, pat is having a better experience without his friends!
[0:51:32] <%X2Eliah> Tier 4 out of 15 looks pretty difficult

[0:51:40] <+b_aleph> Isn't pat soooo self sufficient LUL
[0:51:54] <%BoxNavy> spool
[0:51:59] <lil_drummer2552> @CallMeTheBaus Yeah, the crafting system lets you level up, upgrade rarity, and upgrade attributes on guns.
[0:51:59] <%captain_thickthighs> crossplay has been having errors all day
[0:52:00] <sendart> pat seems allergic to cover
[0:52:00] <%shootbang_exe> from my experience with the demo the game was a fair bit easier and faster with friends
[0:52:06] <ner0romanov> AI also had really good aim. they know how strong we are
[0:52:08] <%MelBrooksKA> MelBrooksKA subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! Hey Pat

[0:52:24] <%BoxNavy> s
[0:52:27] <+Who_lio42> @CallMeTheBaus i dunno if LONG term, but you can keep an item by keep leveling it up and adjusting its ability and upping rarity on it
[0:52:37] <%FunkyStreams> gotta use all three abilities.
[0:52:39] <+MF_C00M> crazy talk
[0:52:42] <+Mrbaconator> i was a little sad i scrapped a better pistol by accident then the new world tier gave me a sidearm not only better than that one but also just does more damage than my current main weapons
[0:52:49] <%FunkyStreams> oh, my bad nvm.
[0:53:05] <+Who_lio42> use your turret more since it doing damage keeps your hp up
[0:53:19] <%BoxNavy> ohh....
[0:53:20] <%X2Eliah> So is this one of those games where you get more and more gear but never feel any progress vs. enemy difficulty?
[0:53:26] <%Jaxnos> you're doing great
[0:53:29] <viciousgrim> i just had to update my game
[0:53:31] <skewerstar> He be rooting, tooting, and by god he shooting. but most of all... He Kind!

[0:55:01] <%kknutson4> It's more like Division 2 with Destiny-like guns/skills
[0:55:02] <%captain_thickthighs> destiney is like the kfc of gaming for me
[0:55:03] <%BoxNavy> i think they mean like. its not a GAAS
[0:55:04] <bear_breaker20> the ui is almost 1 to 1
[0:55:06] <%X2Eliah> maybe this is ANTHEM
[0:55:07] <ner0romanov> I love the crafting system
[0:55:09] <balthazar758> the animations are very gears of war
[0:55:13] <%valriot> the issue its more a case of everyone assumes its like Derstiny, cos people keep trying to be Destiny and failing miserably
[0:55:17] <+ALazo> It's almost like they thought people would look at it and think it's like destiny.
[0:55:18] <yourliteraldog> I bet pr wouldn't let them say We tried make destiny but good and not a gas
[0:55:19] <%BoxNavy> moon2WOW shes back
