[0:19:17] <%GarbageNirvana> okay I'm on day 4 now so I don't think this is going to spoil anything for me
[0:19:19] <%AncelDeLambert> see, you have to leave the box around so the cat will sleep in it normally
[0:19:21] <+titansloth93> Mr Peepee will punish you for imprisoning him
[0:19:23] <penitentpendant> Much mediocre english I am tonight, yes
[0:19:25] <marvel877> Just like my cat
[0:19:28] <%linSP> Elmo means hellmo
[0:19:29] <%AncelDeLambert> the box has to be a household object that they're familiar with
[0:19:32] <%thbluewarden> with a box cutter?
[0:19:44] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Yahtzee just did a review on Outriders. It was brutal LUL
[0:19:45] <%AncelDeLambert> Elmo a big stinky, huh?
[0:19:46] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> LUL He gonna cut you, man rgtHhc
[0:19:47] <marvel877> that's why you got to trick the cat.
[0:19:47] <sirtommygunn> have you tried a cardboard box, i hear cats love those
[0:19:49] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> the blanket trick doesn't work on Elmo? @patstaresat
[0:19:53] <$Ziegsy> Hey pat and chat, how you doing?
[0:19:55] <@SoFarFetched> my cats like that too
[0:19:56] <%putnampuppeteer> they recognize the sentiment, not the box
[0:19:56] <%Daxalog> Im having alot of bad luck with groceries recently.
[0:20:06] <%alcors_wisdom> @GarbageQueenEllie need to put that stuff in some soda make some battery acid
[0:20:07] <%AncelDeLambert> cats are big dumb
[0:20:12] <%Dakuu75> general direction
[0:20:14] <%Jekado> because they know its going to the vet when that happens
[0:20:29] <%KishinGrek> it's cuz he knows
[0:20:30] <%JoshManVGH> Vet Sense Activate
[0:20:34] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @alcors_wisdom Yoo that's way cooler than insta-melt ice cubes
[0:20:39] <%SveriSageAdvice> @AncelDeLambert cats are in fact very smart, hence why they're so good at being assholes
[0:20:40] <%AncelDeLambert> he min-maxed
[0:20:48] <%Mr_Pylon> you cat child is box smart
[0:20:51] <%Jekado> its the act of going
[0:20:51] <%AzureGale> Elmo is a mind reader
[0:20:52] <penitentpendant> He invested in the 'Anti-Vet Thought'
[0:20:52] <marvel877> cat's like getting into boxes, they DO NOT like being put into one
[0:20:57] <Jonny_Uppercut> Maybe he just doesn't like the ride there
[0:20:58] <cardamomo88> he just wanna stay home
[0:21:00] <choopercabra> maybe he hates the ride to the vet
[0:21:01] <$Ziegsy> My dog LOVES the vet. Vet fusses him and she gets to ride on the tramway
[0:21:04] <%AncelDeLambert> Elmo has Shivers
[0:21:06] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Yeah, he's a huge baby. Weird.
[0:21:10] <%JoshManVGH> What if you put him in the box at random times, but not close the door?
[0:21:16] <%JoshManVGH> Keep him on his beans.
[0:21:19] <%Lion_kun> Does Gief give the vet trouble
[0:21:19] <%alcors_wisdom> @GarbageQueenEllie yeah the acidity of soda will fuck up your ice cubes

[0:33:09] <%sakeydo> it only takes one childhood incident to install permanent food looking awareness. Not all people possess this install.
[0:33:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I am also seeing the dentist friday. But surgery sounds ouch. Good luck
[0:33:20] <+Anarchdovey> hello
[0:33:20] <%Daxalog> There is no pain like tooth pain
[0:33:27] <%GarbageNirvana> Unless they shoot you up with the good shit
[0:33:30] <$Ziegsy> I got my wisdom tooth pulled under local. that was wild
[0:33:31] <%Fooguwu> scream until they give you better drugs
[0:33:31] <+LionKagura> @TurtlesAndTentacles You're welcome SeemsGood
[0:33:32] <%feelmyfunk> did pat have a famous high school year book quote
[0:33:34] <penitentpendant> When you go from 'Ow' to 'ALL I AM IS PAIN'
[0:33:36] <librettodude> The Proximity to where your Entire Being rests makes dental surgery especially discomforting
[0:33:37] <$Trenr> dentist said I wasn't allowed to scream
[0:33:42] <Keibutt> i once had two teeth removed and they kept having to inject more stuff into my mouth cause the pain kept pushing through it the longer they were in there cutting up one of the teeth
[0:33:52] <fritz_dacat> I can’t find a dentist to pull my tooth I can feel it breaking down In my mouth
[0:33:55] <aiutare47> @patstaresat that may be because your ginger. It’s proven that gingers have tolerance to certain painkillers
[0:34:04] <Keibutt> fun times
[0:34:06] <northstarotaku11> got me a root canal soon
[0:34:10] <%Broand> Woolie "YO!, CHARTREUSE?!?" Reggie: "lets gooo"

[0:34:23] <ZE_Count> My mouth is big enough to handle all my teeth lucky me.
[0:34:28] <kikoeru_san> My dad had his wisdom teeth removed with no pain killers
[0:34:28] <%crimsonharvest> i've been going to the dentist lately and he keeps having to hit me multiple times with the numb juice
[0:34:32] <+D00msDayDan> i'm getting my wisdom teeth out tomorrow woop woop
[0:34:33] <%walternatorz> a constant fear
[0:34:34] <%crimsonharvest> ginger as fuck here
[0:34:38] <$Ziegsy> My 65 pound dog jumped on my lap an ruptured an ovarian cyst. Ive not left the sofa in 3 days
[0:34:38] <%buffaloaff> That would explain Pat's Opioid addiction.
[0:34:39] <Tuna_Can_0> I had all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed, didn't get put under. It was kinda neat
[0:34:40] <%arcielardor> arcielardor subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! Hey Pat. it's my birthday this week! I'm spending it watching schlock with friends every night! Hope your week is cool so far.
[0:34:40] <northstarotaku11> you don't do heroin?
[0:34:43] <%JoshManVGH> I remember hearing "get the mallet" while having all 4 of my wisdom teeth out at once.
[0:34:45] <%TIME_PUNCHER> that's why Pat can do so much crack and be fine
[0:34:46] <%GarbageNirvana> Kim strikes me as very right brain
[0:34:46] <%wibbwobbler> that's pretty crazy
[0:34:49] <cardamomo88> yes
[0:34:51] <+D00msDayDan> it's nice not being addicted to heroin
[0:34:51] <%linSP> one time a dentist had to stab my gums 12 times and i still felt everything
[0:34:53] <Blank9> I had the muscle on the top of the inside of my lip burnt with a tiny torch by the dentist to deal with a gap. But then I healed too fast over the stitches, so they had to rip it open and re-suture it to get them out.
[0:34:54] <Keibutt> mine had to be removed cause i was getting braces and they needed to make space for the rest of the teeth to get pulled back cause overbite
[0:34:56] <%sakeydo> my teeth  don't  come out they just fucking crumble.
[0:34:56] <%Ynkubus_> your gonna need more doctor surgeon man
[0:34:56] <+livingdynamo> I remember I used to think I had thgese horrible black marks on my molars that wouldn't come out no matter how much I brushed, till I watched that terrible The Thing prequel and found out fillings were made of metal, and I'd just been trying to scrub out my fillings
[0:35:05] <%MelBrooksKA> It's a good thing you get that sick ass hair in exchange spyCappa @PatStaresAt

[0:35:40] <%spitelite> thats your super power
[0:35:48] <%TIME_PUNCHER> I had to get a filling and a drill with zero painkillers. that hurt
[0:35:50] <%walternatorz> just use the horse tranquilizer
[0:35:50] <+kewlmyc> I had a high tolerance for laughing gas. Made my wisdom teeth removal one of the worse experiences of my life because they didn't believe me.

[0:37:11] <%Blackleafx> Oh nice, I'm redheaded too and this stuff is 100% accurate to the way me and my mom have gone through this @PatStaresAt
[0:37:15] <Keibutt> i had a moment when i was 2 years old where the doctors could not sedate me no matter what they gave me. I had cut up my knee and no matter what they gave me, I was screaming my head off. Took 5 people to hold me down while they stitched up my knee
[0:37:15] <+GingerStrawhat> Yeah I have a small resistance too and am a redhead and they had to shoot me up alot for my new crown
[0:37:27] <+GingerStrawhat> It didn't wear off until I was going to bed

[0:43:11] <@StridentSong> ALLONS-Y!
[0:43:14] <aiutare47> It’s a publisher
[0:43:14] <%putnampuppeteer> "Zaum (Russian: зáумь) are the linguistic experiments in sound symbolism and language creation of Russian Futurist poets such as Velimir Khlebnikov and Aleksei Kruchenykh. Zaum is a non-referential phonetic entity with its own ontology. The language consists of neologisms that mean nothing."

[1:22:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Just a little drugs
[1:22:15] <+SignScratch> BECUASE DRUGS ARE COOL
[1:22:22] <Tuna_Can_0> I WONDER WHY atpRtsuspectd
[1:22:23] <+emperri> is this a boring cop run
[1:22:25] <Broken_Sonex> Remember, Pat, you need to tell us what main stat you want us to boost is, we don't get to vote on the substats @PatStaresAt
[1:22:25] <ShineTheDiamond> Your character is an addict. It makes sense that he's craving drugs.
[1:22:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Just a little Drugs,
[1:22:28] <Ravioli_Ronin> There is one time you’re probably going to want to do speed
[1:22:29] <%Kataguro> The Samaran Butter is gone.  It was the billboard in the waterlock
[1:22:30] <+Astrobstrd> You are an actual addict and the stats are all basically intrusive thought generators
[1:22:33] <primaryfire> samaran butter is the billboard in the waterlock
[1:22:33] <marcdyllan> like clapton said,m "when you want to get down" electrochemisty
[1:22:34] <jorniev> addiction is like that thought
[1:22:35] <blackskulldragon18> The Addict within REEALLY want you to Do it after being sober for 3 days
[1:22:39] <Jimsehy> Your character is suffering from withdrawal
[1:22:50] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you have things to tell joyce, Titus and Evrart
[1:22:53] <ZE_Count> the butter one was cool
[1:22:56] <penitentpendant> Fast travel is quite limited in the game
[1:22:57] <huggle_frumper_45> Do Canadians have DARE?
[1:23:03] <+emperri> this soundtrack is so good
[1:23:04] <%Kataguro> You can tell Joyce about the drug trade for instance
[1:23:12] <cardamomo88> go to the gym
[1:23:16] <%VyperVic> has he been to the car
[1:23:17] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Btw, if you consider buying dice, it takes hours for her to make them
[1:23:20] <+SignScratch> I love the docks music
[1:23:20] <HonterThompson> @emperri Lots of people's first Disco runs are them trying to do an average-stat, do everything, make friends with everyone run (even when that's no fun)
[1:23:24] <RyuuAoi> @jimsehy Hey @patstaresat he's got a point
[1:23:33] <penitentpendant> @VyperVic Ran past it, something for later
[1:23:33] <%ssjklyco> Only 6 hours
[1:23:42] <+emperri> @honterthompson I don't think this is pat's first run
[1:23:44] <%thelaxinator> @huggle_frumper_45 yeah my school went to a DARE event once. We also had an Anti-drug middle school program called VIP
[1:23:47] <%VyperVic> @penitentpendant thanks
[1:23:58] <aiutare47> I missed it too
[1:24:06] <penitentpendant> It's the same tree as the free dice, so it's easy to miss the 'purchase' option
[1:24:09] <ZE_Count> da bearrr
[1:24:16] <%VyperVic> 9pm is 21:00
[1:24:26] <%hax_metatron> LUL
[1:24:29] <%bassoontyphoon> You can acquire dice from other places too
[1:24:32] <HonterThompson> @emperri He said he played up until that Klaasje interrogation, so it'll be his first complete run
[1:24:36] <RyuuAoi> @huggle_frumper_45 Honestly
[1:24:39] <aiutare47> Pat is too dumb for 24h time
[1:24:45] <%thelaxinator> I still have my DARE shirt from that event, they gave XXL's to elementary students for some reason
[1:24:57] <+emperri> @honterthompson ic

[1:26:48] <aiutare47> i think one
[1:26:52] <%BigCoffee> Why do you need a die anyway?
[1:26:53] <+emperri> I think you can only get one unless they changed it
[1:26:53] <KaiserMario> You can buy all, but it's not cheap
[1:26:57] <KaiserMario> ONLY ONE?
[1:27:00] <%Nobrev> @PatStaresAt I'm actually cleaning up some dice i cased in resin right now
[1:27:01] <Tuna_Can_0> monkaS
[1:27:01] <Ravioli_Ronin> She won’t give you specifics re dice effects
[1:27:04] <+pectusumbra> I think you can keep buying but it's more time and money?
[1:27:04] <NeroInfinite> You can get as many as you can afford
[1:27:09] <aiutare47> @BigCoffee buffs

[1:32:32] <jorniev> THIS gives you a +2 against measure head
[1:32:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> trying to say Titus and talk at the same time?

[2:06:19] <+projectmanatees> What’s happened now?
[2:06:20] <wolfen091> he just got the shita folks, blaming elmo and gief how shameful
[2:06:40] <ZE_Count> the kids causing all sorts of trouble
[2:06:52] <%invalid_robin> Question: The stats page on the stream doesn't show all the stats. Is that normal?
[2:06:56] <+Jiggisnipe> Elmo and Gief are being Elmo and Gief
[2:07:06] <%Cozy90> @VyperVic i just thought it was really funny
[2:07:15] <%Cozy90> @VyperVic i didn not expect it

[2:07:33] <BerryliciousDefinition> LUL
[2:07:48] <%VyperVic> @invalid_robin you gotta scroll down
[2:08:06] <+yogsbac0n> I just noticed he found the bullet before getting fooled.  Did he save scum or just actually get lucky?
[2:08:11] <%VyperVic> the stats go by columns here,  not rows like in the game
[2:08:20] <aiutare47> @yogsbac0n Luck
[2:08:28] <ingman112> I think the only check Pat's save scummed for was the interfacing to open the ledger
[2:08:30] <+yogsbac0n> Nice
[2:08:40] <%VyperVic> @yogsbac0n lucky, but he also got it in the previous run
[2:08:54] <%SveriSageAdvice> @yogsbac0n he found it on his previous playthrough as well
[2:09:05] <%GarbageNirvana> That's a motorics check right?
[2:09:19] <%SveriSageAdvice> yup
[2:09:20] <%VyperVic> yes?
[2:09:26] <+oda_flobunaga> Alright, time to start writing Pat's obit
[2:09:28] <aiutare47> @garbagenirvana Yeah interfacing
[2:09:29] <%VyperVic> can't remember which one
[2:09:48] <%VyperVic> interfacing a guy's skull is wild
[2:09:48] <aiutare47> I think it was interfacing
[2:09:54] <HonterThompson> @yogsbac0n Is it lucky? I thought the game gave you the "wait, let's examine this body closer" white-check every time you did the autopsy- everyone I know instantly grinded that white check before doing anything else
[2:09:58] <trickster721> I can't believe the cat actually ate the dog
[2:09:59] <%GarbageNirvana> mm'k
[2:10:17] <trickster721> Just opened him mouth real big like a snake
[2:10:20] <aiutare47> This is taking a while
[2:10:32] <%GarbageNirvana> As I recall it's a pretty tough check even with decent motorics
[2:10:41] <+Jiggisnipe> yea this is actually long, I wonder what they did
[2:10:50] <CappuccinoGuil> can you scroll down the skill screen on the Twitch integration?

[2:11:14] <BerryliciousDefinition> @CappuccinoGuil yes
[2:11:20] <CappuccinoGuil> I'm having some trouble doing the scrolling LUL
[2:11:24] <%GarbageNirvana> At a guess, one or both of them left something somewhere
[2:11:27] <ZE_Count> did the animals kill pat>'
[2:11:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Or is trying to get into something they shouldn't
[2:11:33] <%thedankestmeeme> HE SAID IT
[2:11:43] <%thedankestmeeme> Reload!
[2:11:46] <+projectmanatees> Did zangeif sent us up the bomb
[2:11:49] <+yogsbac0n> The thing about this game is it makes me want to save scum every little thing cuz it seems like it'll be important.  Then the game (or rather, Kim) makes fun of me for wanting to know what's inside the shipping container or for looking at that wall every time we pass lmao
[2:11:54] <%GarbageNirvana> This length of time feels like cleaning though
[2:11:57] <sirtommygunn> dang the kids must really be acting up\

[2:12:51] <NastiCrimeboy> psaGib psaGiefrail
[2:12:55] <NewWillinium> . .I *just* noticed that  Zangief does a little dance as well in the "Be right back" screen. That's adorable.
[2:13:02] <+oda_flobunaga> Cock Carosel stops at 39
[2:13:29] <Tisaric> the game is really good at getting you to plan for one way of playing and throwing you off it as much as it can
[2:13:31] <iosephe> You can only get off the cock carousel when you're dead
[2:13:42] <CappuccinoGuil> @NewWillinium you didn't notice the little steppity steps he does?
[2:13:50] <+emperri> the first time I heard cock carousel I thought they meant meatspin
[2:13:51] <trickster721> I can't believe I forgot the cock carousel lore
[2:14:00] <+keyoray> the cock carousel never stops

[2:21:21] <NewWillinium> So hjas anyone else been struggling to figure out what relative "time frame" this game is?  Like I want to say . . .WW1 era*ish* technology wise but it's incredibly difficult to nail it down.

[2:34:02] <Tisaric> the voice adds so much to Titus
[2:34:13] <primaryfire> wait is that what the peephole was? a bullet impact?

[3:02:31] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> isnt he compromised
[3:02:31] <%Treuan> Wait is Rhetoric still compromised?
[3:02:32] <Chatterbox1991> TOP
[3:02:33] <+Dorf1> it means read everything before ytou pick
[3:02:33] <KaiserMario> It's how you've been playing...
[3:02:34] <%dalmek> start at top for info, bottom to conclude and make a choice
[3:02:34] <%Mr_Pylon> DON'T CONCLUDE YET
[3:02:35] <%dork_doggler> It means it's a REAL good idea just to go through this sequentially
[3:02:37] <oioioisa> Don't pick the wrong one
[3:02:37] <Alfred_Waaghur> Whatever, Rhetoric is still ompromised anyway.
[3:02:37] <librettodude> Literally Start at the top of the list, choice at the bottom
[3:02:38] <primaryfire> it's meta like the jamrock shuffle
[3:02:38] <+newbroxes> Just a lil meta jab
[3:02:39] <%neroforte177> godamn volition is that mf right now
[3:02:39] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt rhetoric could be lying again
[3:02:41] <+rocketaku> dont fucking click 5 you goof
[3:02:41] <+sabertoothzombie> 1 2 3 4
[3:02:42] <NeroInfinite> 1 is top
[3:02:43] <JoshyJay> decide once youve exhausted your options
[3:02:43] <cardamomo88> 1 2 3 4
[3:02:43] <ItsPastas> Choose at the bottom!
[3:02:44] <sirtommygunn> choices are usually at the bottom, top questions give you more info
[3:02:45] <+Rofiarf> don't pick 5 until you want to choose
[3:02:46] <trickster721> It's a 4th wall break
[3:02:46] <Broken_Sonex> WORK YOUR WAY DOWN
[3:02:47] <Yakobro> what does start at the top mean 🤔
[3:02:47] <fedemachado96> ASK HER FIRST
[3:02:47] <+wizard_of_diamonds> OH BOY
[3:02:48] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL oh boi
[3:02:49] <+emperri> it's not saying bottom choice, it's just referring to the format of having everything in a column
[3:02:49] <+Firgof> This is what a real convo boss fight is like y'all
[3:02:50] <17sevens> pat you can't reverse wrong answers to get to the truth
[3:02:50] <fuji_92> don't conclude basically
[3:02:51] <%BappoTheMighty> oKAY
[3:02:52] <akitanito> pat mindbroke from meta
[3:02:54] <%BappoTheMighty> Yo
[3:02:54] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The suspense is terrible. I hope it lasts.
[3:02:54] <listopat> is this a bit
[3:02:55] <%therustystream> ok I'm gonna smoke weed and eat a cannoli when you come back
[3:02:55] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> get info first, then make your choice like always
[3:02:55] <%baka_sugoi> evo15MindBlown sbfpSetIn NotLikeThis
[3:02:58] <digaogrunge> Means rhetoric is fucked and he wants to let her go
[3:03:03] <+keyoray> is Retoric compromoised still?
[3:03:03] <primaryfire> don't overthink it
[3:03:05] <ItsPastas> Cliffhanger!
[3:03:05] <fedemachado96> e
[3:03:07] <penitentpendant> Pat havin' his think time
[3:03:08] <%Cn_alpha_02> 2
[3:03:10] <muXPerience> Rhetoric is telling you he's back, and the questioning can continue
[3:03:11] <%dork_doggler> lmao Pat's looking at spoilers right now
[3:03:11] <%BappoTheMighty> This game has me on edge every time there's dialogue
[3:03:12] <Blank9> I figured he meant choose the bottom, because that one is a simp choice that doesn't push anything
[3:03:15] <+london_flexing> This isn't that complicated honestly
[3:03:15] <DianaTheAscian> Pats gone chat is there a correct order?
[3:03:15] <+Jiggisnipe> Rhetoric was also compromised right?
[3:03:15] <%AzureGale> The suspense!
[3:03:15] <%BappoTheMighty> Like, holy fuck
[3:03:16] <%linSP> its literally saying do all the free choices first and then proceed to an ultimatum with the last option
[3:03:17] <jorniev> THIS is one part PAT NEEDS to take time to think because once he makes the choice he cant back out
[3:03:21] <%SirGO0SE> right after these messages NotLikeThis
[3:03:23] <+emperri> only volition is unfucked, drama is now overfucked backwards
[3:03:27] <%BappoTheMighty> Drama is my favorite stat.
[3:03:33] <ingman112> Woolie's gonna get here and Reggie'll be like "Nah don't worry about it"
[3:03:38] <NewWillinium> So question.  Has anyone else beaten this game?  I've done it twice now and. . . I genuinely love it.  Don't think I can bring myself to do a Fascist cop playthrough though.
[3:03:40] <ingman112> "She seems nice"
[3:03:41] <+keyoray> @emperri XD
[3:03:48] <+Firgof> It's true. They ain't red but they may as well be.
[3:03:49] <huskarl_zap> Based drama?
[3:03:49] <%VyperVic> yeah, this one is kinda critical. you can't walk this back
[3:03:51] <Blank9> woolie isn't going to pass the volition check probably
[3:03:55] <Blank9> you can miss this entire thing
[3:04:06] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt That was a meta reference, this convo has been full of them, its pointing out that the game has a pattern, extra info is at the top and progress dialogue is at the bottom. Its like Mass Effect, theres a pattern the game holds on to.
[3:04:06] <penitentpendant> @DianaTheAscian Mostly just choose the info gaining questions until the conclusion. She has an extra hint for the case if you don't arrest her. She WILL be murdered if she's arrested.
[3:04:11] <DianaTheAscian> Woolie is gonna get here and forget which skills are compromised somehow
[3:04:12] <ingman112> Hopefully he does. One of the best checks in the whole game
[3:04:21] <%dork_doggler> @NewWillinium All fascist options are purposefully shit, fascist cop is anti-content
[3:04:22] <NewWillinium> I still don't know what that +1 on Semen Avoidence Check was
[3:04:22] <%BappoTheMighty> @emperri Drama is like the friend you're trying to get to chill out, but instead convince him the that chilling out is wrong and needs to just start yelling at everyone
[3:04:23] <muXPerience> Is that a Book of the New Sun ref
[3:04:25] <DianaTheAscian> @penitentpendant k hx
[3:04:30] <ingman112> @penitentpendant YO EASY ON THE SPOILS
[3:04:34] <ingman112> He could come back any time
[3:04:35] <%VyperVic> @newwillinium did a commie art run. Favorite game of the 2010's
[3:04:56] <ingman112> And this chat ain't moving fast enough atm
[3:05:05] <Archmortal> @NewWillinium it was about how she avoided the question about requesting a semen sample
[3:05:06] <%VyperVic> @penitentpendant yeah please keep it down
[3:05:08] <aiutare47> it could always move faster
[3:05:12] <penitentpendant> @ingman112 I forget is that a Shivers or an Inland Empire check specifically
[3:05:13] <tanarath> Does chat need emote only mode?
[3:05:13] <%dork_doggler> @VyperVic actual art degree and wompty dompty dom center is the most broken build i've seen in anything
[3:05:13] <+Jiggisnipe> remind chat to refrain from dropping info that was not already revealed
[3:05:15] <cardamomo88> HAVE TO SPEED CHAT
[3:05:21] <NewWillinium> @NewWillinium About what I have seen yeah.  Though apparently the Fasc Political quest is great.  I LOVED the Moralist quest.  Even if that game bugged out and read me as Communist.
[3:05:21] <+icekept> yea so no spoil
[3:05:22] <sirrice77> Remember everyone it was *love* and *communism* that killed him
[3:05:27] <NewWillinium> @Archmortal Ohhhhh
[3:05:28] <ingman112> Shivers, but shhhh
[3:05:29] <+emperri> apart from Volition being unfucked, Inland Empire is never wrong. but I think they avoid having him chime in on this conversation
[3:05:30] <+icekept> no spoil pls
[3:05:30] <penitentpendant> Flooding it with extra info in the mean time
[3:05:31] <akitanito> speed for cuno
[3:05:42] <%thedankestmeeme> BIG SPOILS JEEZ GUYS
[3:05:47] <%Mendin> Spin up the cock carousel
[3:05:49] <ingman112> @penitentpendant Good moves
[3:05:54] <aiutare47> Well, moderate spoils
[3:05:56] <%VyperVic> @emperri encyclo is also clean
[3:05:57] <penitentpendant> @emperri Does the tie contribute anything to this conversation?
[3:05:59] <tanarath> Emote only mode, please.
[3:06:03] <DianaTheAscian> can u stab Cuno?
[3:06:05] <+JustToWatch> If Pat saw this he'd probably ban you
[3:06:07] <+keyoray> are we still going to drug up Cuno?
[3:06:12] <%thedankestmeeme> MODCHECK
[3:06:15] <sirrice77> @DianaTheAscian No only punch him
[3:06:20] <tanarath> stfu
[3:06:20] <trickster721> Cuno's been throwing rocks for like a week straight, he needs speed to keep going
[3:06:21] <+Firgof> @DianaTheAscian Sadly no. But you can punch him and be a horrible person.
[3:06:21] <+emperri> @penitentpendant nope, but he might later
[3:06:25] <cardamomo88> can we time out the spoliers
[3:06:27] <jorniev> cock carousel to avoid spoilers
[3:06:29] <DianaTheAscian> @sirrice77 damn
[3:06:30] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you can punch cuno tho
[3:06:32] <+Jiggisnipe> still should be timed out
[3:06:36] <aiutare47> @DianaTheAscian you can shoot him or the girl i think, but its an instant game over, maybe im misremembering
[3:06:46] <+JustToWatch> yeah a mod should wipe the chat
[3:06:47] <ingman112> The girl
[3:06:48] <penitentpendant> @emperri Tragically i didn't have my Inland high enough my first run so I didn't get him chattin' to me
[3:06:49] <+emperri> ^
[3:06:55] <DianaTheAscian> jesus
[3:06:58] <%linSP> yeah i got 10 composure and shot the girl and lost the game lmao
[3:07:01] <CappuccinoGuil> So, did you all see the Ultrakill V1 body pillow?
[3:07:05] <primaryfire> @aiutare47 can only shoot the demon behind the fence
[3:07:11] <cardamomo88> i shoot the child
[3:07:11] <+Firgof> High Inland Empire turns the game into a far more meta experience, yeah.
[3:07:12] <aiutare47> Ahhhh
[3:07:16] <criminalworld> @CappuccinoGuil wish i could cop.
[3:07:16] <jorniev> @CappuccinoGuil THE WAHT!?
[3:07:17] <tanarath> STFU with spoilet
[3:07:19] <+icekept> @CappuccinoGuil the wat
[3:07:23] <+Firgof> You get some Twin Peaks in your cop game
[3:07:24] <%VyperVic> @cappuccinoguil which one did you buy
[3:07:25] <ingman112> I'm not convinced Cuno wouldn't just tank the bullet if you tried to shoot him
[3:07:26] <penitentpendant> I like the unexpected Game overs you can get in this game
[3:07:33] <penitentpendant> "Wait you let me do that?"
[3:07:43] <Albafica_picses> Did anyone  watch the returnal gameplay?
[3:07:45] <NewWillinium> Have we *all* died because of that danged Chair?
[3:07:46] <CappuccinoGuil> @VyperVic none, dude, I'm about to lose my one job next month, probably LUL
[3:07:48] <%VyperVic> @ingman112 speed's a hell of a drug
[3:07:54] <aiutare47> Well Inland Empire is also a reference to Malkavianism in VtM too
[3:07:58] <Broken_Sonex> We don't need to wipe the chat is just this guy @penitentpendant He said some spoilers.
[3:08:06] <NeroInfinite> I know I died because of that chair
[3:08:06] <sirrice77> @NewWillinium No only because i knew the chair was dangerous
[3:08:08] <aiutare47> so it makes sense it gives you info you shouldnt have
[3:08:08] <+Firgof> Hey man that chair was red in an empty room. The themes were screamin' at you
[3:08:10] <%neroforte177> ok butblike can you reason with cuno or the little gremlin tho?
[3:08:10] <ingman112> @VyperVic "FUCK DOES CUNO CARE"
[3:08:20] <%VyperVic> we can bury the spoilers
[3:08:21] <penitentpendant> Is true, which is why I'm covering it up with white noise
[3:08:23] <DianaTheAscian> chair?
[3:08:25] <+emperri> they undersell inland empire, it's super important if you care about the setting
[3:08:30] <penitentpendant> Bury the light
[3:08:37] <Cpt_phantom> I can’t wait. I’ve been a sober, logical and calculating cop. I want to start a strong, psycho mess cop run
[3:08:38] <CappuccinoGuil> @icekept @jorniev I wish I was even joking. Look it up, it's great AND official LUL
[3:08:41] <+keyoray> cock carousel + IE?
[3:08:41] <aiutare47> Just like Malk playthroughs
[3:08:42] <%VyperVic> @ingman112 that line in his old voice is burned in my mind
[3:08:42] <Archmortal> @neroforte177 there's an empathy check with Cuno if you don't try to punch him
[3:08:46] <penitentpendant> Inland + Shiver is nice for psychic cop
[3:08:52] <wolfen091> alright, I went to shower, what happened this time for him to leave
[3:08:56] <+icekept> @penitentpendant u might hav to apologize
[3:08:56] <+Firgof> Logic, Volition, and Inland Empire feel like, so far through my runs, the best ones to signature
[3:08:56] <%Maids4lyfe> okay left to the store on Pat's break, come back to Pat's break
[3:09:01] <+emperri> walk dog
[3:09:01] <%dork_doggler> @emperri IE, Encyclopedia, and Shivers are the setting stats
[3:09:03] <sirrice77> @wolfen091 doggo
[3:09:04] <+keyoray> I want to be a roided up dreamer cop
[3:09:07] <%Maids4lyfe> did Elmo kill anyone?
[3:09:08] <+icekept> to be safe
[3:09:08] <aiutare47> @wolfen091 walking dog
[3:09:09] <+Jiggisnipe> taking Gief to pee I believe
[3:09:09] <alternatecoyote> So is there a “second worst stat” besides encyclopedia as cited by Pat on the podcast?
[3:09:12] <jorniev> i got a game over from calling out the wrong person when talking to titus, the old man straight up ices  you
[3:09:12] <+Firgof> For just straight progress and hints but not fun I mean
[3:09:14] <DSD24> Empathy is good too
[3:09:24] <%Maids4lyfe> oh dog walking
[3:09:25] <sirrice77> @alternatecoyote half light
[3:09:26] <ingman112> You always wanna signature a skill you don't have high in, right? To raise the cap on the rest
[3:09:26] <NewWillinium> I.  . .hm.  I think that's about the only time I died in the game.  I would have died from the Semenese Race Supremicist but I stuffed as much health drugs into me as I could
[3:09:27] <%VyperVic> conceptualization and inland have good synergy,
[3:09:27] <%Maids4lyfe> that's important
[3:09:30] <penitentpendant> @wolfen091 He wanted to think on a choice and Gief wanted to use the restroom. Good time to take a break.
[3:09:31] <DianaTheAscian> hi  hi
[3:09:34] <%thedankestmeeme> RELOAD!
[3:09:34] <%linSP> yeah pat the game is saying get as much info as you can before moving on to an ultimatum with the bottom option
[3:09:35] <aiutare47> @alternatecoyote Half light always tells you youre about to die and start shooting
[3:09:35] <cardamomo88> hellooo
[3:09:37] <%WhereIsWill> here we goooo
[3:09:37] <+Firgof> Welcome back to the boss fight, pat
[3:09:38] <%SirGO0SE> psaUp
[3:09:40] <Blank9> just b urself
[3:09:40] <wolfen091> we should just put gief in pats clothes and have him stream
[3:09:41] <+emperri> @dork_doggler yeah but like, nothing is as much of a lore dump as the last conversation on the island with the inland check
[3:09:41] <%neroforte177> @archmortal I figured
[3:09:43] <%dork_doggler> @alternatecoyote Encyclopedia is a great stat, no clue why Pat called it the worst
[3:09:44] <huskarl_zap> cock carousel 2, castle super s*mps 0
[3:09:48] <penitentpendant> Gief time is important
[3:09:49] <cardamomo88> here we gi
[3:10:02] <ingman112> @emperri Easy
[3:10:08] <+Jiggisnipe> Drama LUL
[3:10:15] <alternatecoyote> @dork_doggler I think he meant in how Encyclopedia can really screw up the pacing if it’s too high
[3:10:16] <cardamomo88> GO DRAMA GO
[3:10:18] <Frampis> they're compromised
[3:10:19] <penitentpendant> Drama angery
[3:10:19] <PartyFavors> uh oh, overcompensation
[3:10:19] <HeroToxiko> why are we even listening to drama
[3:10:22] <sirtommygunn> a lot of details
[3:10:23] <%boxboten> oh hell yes this part

[3:11:50] <HeroToxiko> she is reborn
[3:12:04] <NewWillinium> You know?  It's kind of really interesting to see a game and world peppered in French.  Usually I just see Spanish, or Deutsch, or heck even Russian.  But French words being thrown around everywhere is *weird* and interesting.
[3:12:07] <Chatterbox1991> what i miss?
[3:12:09] <+emperri> she's so full of shit LUL
[3:12:12] <Chatterbox1991> i had to shit

[3:20:22] <+Rofiarf> yopu should inspect the window when you can
[3:20:23] <Alfred_Waaghur> Oh she is being *so* helpful, isn't she?
[3:20:23] <%Kilagn> Kilagn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 27 month streak! Holy shit this is a long time. Random thought but what do you think will come of FF16? Another 15 situation where we get a half finished but kind of okay game or something more along the lines of FF7R? Also no one has ever called them burgers.
[3:20:26] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh god, the secret room?
[3:20:27] <jorniev> @cardamomo88 PAT IS making AN IMPORTANT CHOICE
[3:20:32] <%VyperVic> @cardamomo88 dude, there's so much
[3:20:32] <tanarath> @cardamomo88 a bit. some serious stuff.
[3:20:36] <akitanito> but the shot went through the window
[3:20:39] <%dork_doggler> @neroforte177 isn't it always? the socdems killed rosa luxemborg for less
[3:20:43] <%toolofparanoia> so instead of a cock carousel it was a CLIT carrousel
[3:20:52] <penitentpendant> @neroforte177 I mean... Trojan War was a thing
[3:20:53] <NightNiix> this conversation is a key moment, very careful there
[3:20:55] <DianaTheAscian> oh thats creepy as shit

[3:21:05] <DSD24> Isn't the shot through the window though?
[3:21:06] <Broken_Sonex> @neroforte177 Isn't how these things always start out as?
[3:21:08] <cardamomo88> oh boi
[3:21:13] <aiutare47> @dork_doggler Wasnt it the Stalinists? The paramiltary?
[3:21:15] <akitanito> angle of shot doesn't seem right
[3:21:22] <HonterThompson> @penitentpendant The Trojan War is myth and there's no historical precedent for it
[3:21:25] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  worth noting that it's unlikely that Guns in this setting are shit and it's likely a long range rifle doesnt exsist, it might have been a pistol or short rifle that killed him
[3:21:27] <+emperri> this is being actively pulled out of her own asshole
[3:21:28] <DSD24> Oh god
[3:21:30] <%Maids4lyfe> Apparently dogs over-licking can be a symptom of canine obsessive compulsive disorder, or excessive boredom

[4:41:19] <aiutare47> ALMOST LIKE SOME KIND OF REFERENCE
[4:41:26] <%bread_assassin> I don't know what stat it was that prompted it, but I got the option to do a Conceptualization check to give this guy a purposely BAD idea.
[4:41:29] <MikeStark> FYI If you passed the check he would have given you 100 Reale
[4:41:33] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL

[4:44:17] <groovykrovvy> Art Cop will pay off more, it already has with SICK POETIC VERBS
[4:44:17] <$hattrick61> Failing checks gives you 1 doller

[4:50:53] <yeeyeyee> because he knows you won't do shit
[4:50:54] <ingman112> He's just backing up his guys' story
[4:50:56] <sirrice77> Because he WANTS this
[4:50:59] <%rrratbastard> Hardie boys wanted to take the fall so they might have told evrart the same
[4:51:13] <+JustToWatch> Titus was openly bragging about it
[4:51:14] <+tigerfang86> doesnt know FUCK
[4:51:16] <Parapattern> It's almost like cops and organized crime have troubling similarities
[4:51:17] <%VyperVic> the hardies were projecting the idea that they killed him
[4:51:19] <+aslfrasle> @herotoxiko The problem would be solved and, eventually, there well be no more hired killers in the world.

[4:52:00] <@commanderclaw> God this game has some hateable people
[4:52:01] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> How did he take a look?
[4:52:10] <ingman112> He is purposefully feeding you shit that's already a step behind
[4:52:13] <kazadaz> I don't think there's anyone named Rose in this game
[4:52:14] <%Piemono> Did Pat ever get his gun back?
[4:52:14] <NewWillinium> . . I think I want Evert's Chair.

[4:54:39] <%DashXero> Don't look at the underside of that desk.
[4:54:42] <faegbeard> but it's vigilantism for the people Kappa
[4:54:42] <penitentpendant> Nice indirect lie on Evrart's part "7"
[4:54:45] <Tisaric> yeah he's a fucking slimeball
[4:54:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Martyrs by force
[4:54:51] <%swesterly> no good dirty opportunist socdems
[4:54:58] <ingman112> That desk is normally a few inches lower
[4:54:58] <yeeyeyee> Evrart is the socialist Senator from MGR
[4:55:00] <SomeAsianDood> yup titus is in charge
[4:55:08] <%Mr_Pylon> man Evrart won't give Kim the time of day
[4:55:09] <%Alazull> @Blackleafx Oh they'll get them eventually, but like hundreds of Union workers could potentially die before they go down
[4:55:15] <%Monkeyweed21> @Blackleafx the union outnumbers them 1000 to 1, but how many will the mercs kill before they go down?
[4:55:19] <Alfred_Waaghur> What a huge pile of scum, Jesus.
[4:55:19] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Jokes on you. I don't like women or men
[4:55:23] <%Deft_Thought> Seems like this was a little out of order

[4:55:50] <%swesterly> TAKE THE BRIBE
[4:55:52] <ingman112> Don't forget about the goddamn GUN
[4:55:52] <criminalworld> is this sequence breaking
[4:55:56] <%Alazull> The point is Evrart wants a bloodbath. It's good publicity, it gets rid of a faction in his group that could challenge him, and it helps to make it so there is less people in on owning the terminal when he gets it
[4:56:01] <DSD24> Hmmm
[4:56:03] <CappuccinoGuil> Yooooo perfect timing

[4:59:26] <%BappoTheMighty> It's EMPATHY
[4:59:26] <%SirGO0SE> wait no kap?
[4:59:27] <+derpy_platypus> He believes his own bullshit
[4:59:27] <NightNiix> Empathy doenst equal truth
[4:59:27] <NeroInfinite> maybe??
[4:59:27] <%MrMegaJackpots> ye
[4:59:28] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @yeeyeyee So...he did deserve it then?
[4:59:28] <+DinnerCalzone> Empathy thinks so
[4:59:28] <whispersilk001> I think he's looking out for people but he's still wrong.
[4:59:28] <WingsOfBlueEX> *He* Believes it
[4:59:28] <kazadaz> evrart believes much of what he says
[4:59:30] <tanarath> Empathy lies
[4:59:30] <%VyperVic> he means it.
[4:59:30] <$SGrim> Evrart is slime-core
[4:59:30] <pi_in_the_sci> 5
[4:59:32] <Sunstalker> Looking out for all the martinais as in HE WANTS THEZ WHOLE CITY PLOT OF LAND?
[4:59:32] <NightNiix> 5
[4:59:33] <+StingtheKing> Don't you live there?
[4:59:33] <%walternatorz> You're compromised!
[4:59:33] <penitentpendant> He does, but it's his interpretation of which 'people' he's looking for
[4:59:33] <bionicwillpower> dont trust him
[4:59:33] <ingman112> Gotta get that GUN
[4:59:34] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> yeah
[4:59:34] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> 1
[4:59:35] <+oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt can you trust your mind, really?
[4:59:35] <+Rofiarf> you have to take it for your gun
[4:59:35] <aiutare47> you can do evil for good reasons
[4:59:35] <+Extrallent> I sure hope he means it.
[4:59:35] <NewWillinium> He's CORRUPT as SHIT but . . .a true idealist?
[4:59:36] <+zaworldo> He believes his idiocy pat
[4:59:36] <penitentpendant> 5, need gun
[4:59:36] <AmericanaRed> BibleThump FATSO
[4:59:37] <%kyh9> He is, technically
[4:59:38] <BerryliciousDefinition> yeah
[4:59:39] <AvroEltz> yes and no
[4:59:40] <%DiscoMatador> HE BELIEVES IT
[4:59:40] <+polothegreatest> nah he f lied
[4:59:42] <%VyperVic> go 5. can't vote
[4:59:43] <Alfred_Waaghur> He is complicated huh
[4:59:43] <%Piemono> This Man is a master of double-think
[4:59:44] <+vaderxyz1970> He means it in that HE IS THE BEST OPTION FOR MARTINESE
[4:59:46] <%rrratbastard> the ends justify the means
[4:59:46] <akitanito> take it first for options
[4:59:48] <ZE_Count> look at the letter in your inventory
[4:59:49] <Pookiedaexzile> TECHINICALLY
[4:59:50] <$RealThiele> he wants equal animals so he can be more equal
[4:59:51] <%swesterly> asking the earlier questions just provides context btw
[4:59:52] <Slimeking_Mike> He didn't tell you whether or not they were gonna end up homeless though
[4:59:54] <%ShogunNoonto> if he own it its good for him
[4:59:54] <yeeyeyee> Empathy would never lie to you
[4:59:56] <ZE_Count> there are othe roptions
[4:59:56] <%Alazull> The worst part about this guy is he one hundred percent believes his own bullshit. He really thinks that this is going to improve this neighborhood for everyone, and that whatever sacrifices made are justified by the greater good
[4:59:57] <WingsOfBlueEX> He's convinced himself
[4:59:57] <%kyh9> FOR THE GOOD OF MARTINAISE
[4:59:59] <Lelfro> A drunk idealist drunk on his shit
[5:00:02] <ingman112> Who knows the truth? Certainly not us, chat
[5:00:04] <mm_orios> 2
[5:00:07] <AmericanaRed> BASED???? cmonBruh
[5:00:09] <ingman112> @Alazull STFU
[5:00:14] <penitentpendant> Inspect letter!
[5:00:16] <@commanderclaw> This is the problem with socialism. Capitalists end up running that too
[5:00:19] <$hattrick61> BASED ON WHAT
[5:00:20] <+oda_flobunaga> The GREATER GOOD
[5:00:25] <NewWillinium> Debardeur?  . . . Police Officer?
[5:00:27] <%Alazull> @ingman112 That...wasn't spoilers?
[5:00:28] <penitentpendant> Logic, don't fail us now!
[5:00:32] <iosephe> You could lie right there
[5:00:36] <+Firgof> We're just an expanded series of Inland Empire voices
[5:00:38] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> It's very hard to pin down what Claire actually beleives
[5:00:38] <+MothmanVT> hes got such a good sleezbag voice
[5:00:38] <ZE_Count> goodnight
[5:00:38] <%Blackleafx> GOOD RUN
[5:00:39] <cardamomo88> OH THE SMOKER

[5:00:41] <ZE_Count> meet the smoker
[5:00:42] <%MelBrooksKA> Night Pat
[5:00:43] <Tisaric> god this game is so fucking good
[5:00:44] <ingman112> It's not clear whether that's true from what we know yet
[5:00:46] <%AzureGale> TO BE CONTINUED...
[5:00:48] <%Piemen99> BOOOOO
[5:00:48] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Bye pat
[5:00:52] <AmericanaRed> I JUST GOT HERE NotLikeThis
[5:00:53] <ingman112> So until we do, SHUSH
[5:00:53] <%ShogunNoonto> read that shit
[5:00:54] <+tigerfang86> this game fuckin owns
[5:00:56] <ZE_Count> good game
[5:00:59] <%Dakuu75> this guy has permanent sarcasm-voice and I can't tell if I can believe anything he says lol
[5:01:02] <Estwilde> @NewWillinium debardeur is a word for a dockworker/longshoreman union thing
[5:01:06] <peyodogo> good game
[5:01:06] <%thedankestmeeme> peepoLeave
[5:01:06] <%Monkeyweed21> 12-40 months of construction!
[5:01:07] <%BappoTheMighty> BYE BYE
[5:01:07] <%walternatorz> I forget, were we supposed to remind you of something
[5:01:11] <cardamomo88> GOOD STREAM
[5:01:17] <penitentpendant> G'night everyone! May you not be as impulsive as I was tonight!
[5:01:21] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> This song is dope
[5:01:22] <NewWillinium> Auuugh.  We coming back to Disco tomorrow? . . .or later tonight I guess if you're on the East Coast?
[5:01:36] <+livingdynamo> @Dakuu75 yea he's acting. lots of people acting in this story
[5:01:38] <NewWillinium> @Dakuu75 His vocal Chords are nothing but slime it's great
[5:01:40] <%VyperVic> @walternatorz smoker and dice, I think?
[5:01:43] <peyodogo> was also fun reading the chat, i like seeing people getting hype for lefty shit
[5:01:44] <jorniev> @commanderclaw Everything ends up being part of capitalism
[5:01:56] <ingman112> @Alazull The extent of Evrart's belief/corruption is not totally known yet, and the quests later on depend on it. So it's a spoiler in that sense
[5:01:59] <yeeyeyee> @commanderclaw The claires are no capitalists, that's for sure. Corrupt as shit? A total scumbag? Fucking people over to get his way? Yes, totally. But they're  dyed in the wool socialists.
[5:02:02] <Blank9> everyone's anything you want them to be, if you're crazy enough
[5:02:05] <%AyotoCorp> AyotoCorp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months, currently on a 32 month streak! Happy Birthday Pat!  Too bad I didn't start subbing 3 months earlier, but not much that can be done about it outside of time travel
[5:02:07] <%VyperVic> @peyodogo it is a good feeling
[5:02:36] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I have no idea what is happening in this game, how far in is he?
[5:02:36] <peyodogo> @VyperVic it sure is!
[5:02:51] <$RealThiele> it is the eve of day 3
[5:02:51] <+Firgof> High Inland Empire, High Espirit de Corps, and High Shivers is some trippy shit
[5:02:57] <+livingdynamo> plus revachol is hyper capitalist and the last time a socialist movement happened a coalition of foreign governments literally killed them all and buried them in mass graves, so you kind of have to be a bit slimy to get anything done in the social democrat area
[5:03:10] <+tigerfang86> IMO Evrart is definitely doing it all for the union but he's ONLY in it for the union, if people aren't with him he's going to get past them
[5:03:10] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> So not super far in?
[5:03:19] <+livingdynamo> play by the rules established
[5:03:28] <%BappoTheMighty> This game is amazing!
[5:03:28] <%VyperVic> 60-70. hasn't talked to the old men, hasn't explored south.
[5:03:30] <yeeyeyee> no matter what happens, evrart is fighting for worker's rights, which makes him an ally of justice.
[5:03:42] <T_Sasquatch> i just gained 10 mil experience in ffxiv from a supply mission. I nutted
[5:03:47] <+Firgof> Just not the most 'just' justice
[5:03:54] <%VyperVic> there's still the matter of the smoker
[5:03:59] <+Firgof> More of a 'Just Us'
[5:04:03] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Being part of a union gives me a bias toward union fat man. But he has massive shitty manager energy
[5:04:07] <+tigerfang86> he's got some percentage of Justice
[5:04:08] <Tisaric> maybe at max 60% of the way through, there's still a LOT to go
[5:04:19] <jorniev> Joy surprises me because she actually tries but she is tangled in the horrible decision-making of her company
[5:04:19] <+livingdynamo> i remember the bit where you can find out that evrarte just pays one of the old men playing petanque to do guard duty when the union doesn't need a guard
[5:04:19] <Visorak6> happy birthday pat
[5:04:21] <%VyperVic> he has yet to comb through about half of the map
[5:04:22] <%walternatorz> psaGib

[5:06:13] <Smokin_Fish> Xavier Renegade Angel is art
[5:06:14] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @wolfen091 One of the worst things people have against unions, because it is very true, is that the incompetent benefit the most from its protection
[5:06:14] <NewWillinium> I keep forgetting that Rick and Morty is still airing
[5:06:29] <%ForlornCarton> Happy Birthday to you! psaBig
[5:06:33] <%walternatorz> oh god, he's getting himself a fortnite gift for himself.

[5:06:47] <%walternatorz> for himself.
[5:06:51] <@commanderclaw> A good game, Yoshi P is on it
[5:06:52] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> We talking about Gief
[5:07:01] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Gief and his burgs?
[5:07:02] <+Zxyfer> yoshi p's baby
[5:07:07] <wolfen091> @plaidisthenewplaid yeah man, im in texas and we have very little presence here so we don't have too much of it, but we do have em
[5:07:09] <jorniev> LESSONS WERE LEARNED
[5:07:10] <%Ranryu692> but Pat, Square Enix just put out Outriders LUL
[5:07:13] <sirtommygunn> based on what
[5:07:14] <%Kilagn> Better than FF14? ConcernDoge
[5:07:17] <jorniev> ALL THE WARRIORS
[5:07:18] <%Alazull> It's almost like they learned from Automata
[5:07:22] <T_Sasquatch> MUH DICK
[5:07:23] <+Firgof> It's got all the cards. I'm really hoping for it to hit it out of the park like NieR: Automata
[5:07:24] <T_Sasquatch> AHHHH
[5:07:24] <sirtommygunn> oh ok
[5:07:32] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt so since ffx?
[5:07:33] <+vicar_anat> FLASH FORWARD TO CLIP OF TRASH FIRE
[5:07:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Ba Ba dun Dun Dunnnnnn

[5:07:58] <Sunstalker> Pat gonna order himself a cake shaped in a tiny hat to eat in the closet, withotu Paige
[5:08:00] <+CreggaMonsta> Crazy Talk?
[5:08:00] <%FacetiousAF> the internet said its your birthday i need to throw a money at you soon
[5:08:01] <%JoshManVGH> Let that cook as long as it needs to. Bake a good FF.
[5:08:02] <peyodogo> its gonna be a banger
[5:08:16] <%The_0_2_Hero> iamnolionheart subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Hey Pat I heard it was birthday happy birthday burgers is brilliant
[5:08:18] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @wolfen091 YO, for real?! Me too, dang union busting state
[5:08:19] <heartlesshealer> big pat big and disco overlay still up
[5:08:24] <faithless_zealot> Not gonna hold my breath w/ Square Enix
[5:08:31] <@commanderclaw> FFXVI will come out on time come hell or high water
[5:08:40] <+Firgof> Truth.
[5:08:45] <%DashXero> TRUTH.
[5:08:48] <heartlesshealer> But it barely means shit without the best WRITER
[5:08:48] <jorniev> TRUE
[5:08:50] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Management ruined Cyberpunk
[5:08:51] <heartlesshealer> and management
[5:08:56] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Management can absolutely destroy a good game
[5:09:05] <wolfen091> @plaidisthenewplaid yeah I'm electrical in Dallas ibew local 20, maybe got 500 members total
[5:09:07] <%Alazull> If you want a great example of how management is necessary to make use of great talent, look at Kingdoms of Amalur
[5:09:13] <sirtommygunn> Good management is largely about getting the fuck out of the way
[5:09:19] <+CreggaMonsta> omg cyperpunk
[5:09:24] <+Jolnir> cmonBruh
[5:09:24] <heartlesshealer> It's so easy to find bad management, but then FF14 comes along to be a modern beacon of good management
[5:09:24] <jorniev> THAT GAME IS A what do you call it ANOMALY
[5:09:25] <+CreggaMonsta> that was sure supposed to be a game
[5:09:28] <%Dakuu75> ...
