[0:10:03] <$Chatterbox1991> I understand you are a fan of taking the piss out of the Vore community, among other degenerates, if so, i have an amusing anecdote you might enjoy; similar to the first pilgrims of America and Canada, in South Africa, the Boers, being the forefathers of the white Afrikaaners of, in an unfortunate example of language aging very poorly, are known to history as, i shit you not, the Voortrekkers. So i guess even if our ancestors may have been on the up and up all the time, it can always be worse.

[0:21:33] <%Oxybe> im here pat
[0:21:35] <worldbrand> i think 3/10 is unrealistic because a skeleton would have to adapt to being almost entirely non-contact. they should have been erotic poets or something
[0:21:37] <%thatjuantoo> goodbye psaDab
[0:21:38] <Tucker0603> I like Destiny 2
[0:21:39] <+JamieJaeKitten> @PatStaresAt Pinnacle weapons used to give some very fun ideas for perks and they replaced them with ritual weapons, but now theres only a single ritual weapon this season?
[0:21:41] <%darcfowler1995> Peach you have to have a distinct lack of taste to be into skeletons
[0:21:41] <saiyan24675> How did they even bang the skeleton you know what I’m not going to ask that question

[0:26:06] <%InvisibleMan101> your right the casino level was the worst
[0:26:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> I had Sonic Adventure on Dreamcast and again on Gamecube and that game was trash.
[0:26:08] <Dhurkst> The Sonic Adventure games were great, y'all can suck it
[0:26:09] <%peachy996> 2d Sonic only
[0:26:12] <ha2ken> Donation message good
[0:26:13] <yourliteraldog> The Dream Cast was legit the only console killed by piracy.
[0:26:19] <%GalacticaPhanto> SA2 was pretty good
[0:26:23] <seaechiowai> Adventure was shit but its good parts are conveniently segregated so you can avoid the bad and just play the good
[0:26:27] <zamzoph> final level in Adventure 2 is way better
[0:26:31] <majima666> piracy wasnt the sole reason the dc died
[0:26:34] <%rytyoung> it's a great final level, except they open up your heart too short
[0:26:35] <%Conyst> Hey Pat are you gonna try out the new Monster Ultras? They released one called ultra Rosa and ultra Fiesta.
[0:26:36] <%vectorless_peon> sonic adventure sucks i replayed it recently,
[0:26:37] <+BeefMcCat> Sonic Adventure games are hot garbage but I still love them

[0:26:56] <JetpackMcQuack> You learn to avoid the bad
[0:26:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> Big the Cat made the good parts of that game worse.

[0:39:32] <Shion963> just open the Store tab and it'll give you the bright engram
[0:39:33] <Fien111> For real, Bungie has the shittier writing I've ever seen from the best story tellers I've ever seen. You want to care so god damn much, but nothing is actually happening beyond "OH FUCK END OF DA WORLD STOP IT HERO......the PAAAAATHOOOOS"

[0:54:43] <%LiveStreamOnyx> Hope that’s the same on console
[0:54:45] <KingVantq> weird it took them like 2 years to actually make the UI good
[0:54:47] <%ArcanumMBD> Nerfing everything is a shit way to manage a game. make other options fun or enticing, don't shit all over everyone's efforts

[0:57:22] <+Cardz_> Whether we wanted it or not
[0:57:23] <Charronia> Yeah, dude sucked pretty bad in that cutscene LUL
[0:57:23] <%afronooch> @betrayed_llama it used to be random but people whined
[0:57:27] <%GarbageNirvana> "It hasn't helped us before now" except for fucking Xol
[0:57:31] <Visorak6> Rasputin blows up the almighty and devastates earth with wreckage
[0:57:35] <$demegodz> Yeah but
[0:57:37] <PrinceSpacezero> LUL
[0:57:39] <$demegodz> the city tho

[0:57:50] <ScreamLord> They ONLY thing you can do is evacuate the PLANET if you can't stop the death star
[0:57:55] <Tucker0603> Saint 14 is my boy. he's the best
[0:57:56] <%GarbageNirvana> I swear Zavala's just writing his own goddamn narrative for everything
[0:58:00] <Discount_CJ> What species is your character?
[0:58:00] <%Pyroclase> I'd like to point out that their plan is to blow up the Almighty with Rasputin's weapons, even though that does nothing to reduce the incoming mass.
[0:58:00] <%OToole42> it sounds like keith david
[0:58:03] <%DensityD> BARS
[0:58:04] <+Cardz_> I'd let him
[0:58:04] <$demegodz> Sure thing
[0:58:06] <+stella_potato> hold up saint 14 ius like in this now just chilling? i havnt played since like the moon expansion first dropped
[0:58:06] <$Mothman742> Saint 14 should be titan vangard again
[0:58:09] <%Typhaeon> Rap god Saint
[0:58:10] <%gespenst25> What does it matter if the planet is destroyed? You can just go to another one.
[0:58:14] <%WhereIsWill> bars psaDab sipsipDab
[0:58:16] <%dekkitout> Zavala is voiced by Lance Reddick

[0:58:40] <Charronia> @GarbageNirvana He can screw up as bad as he wants and spin it into a tragic narrative

[0:59:35] <%LiveStreamOnyx> Aww man, I’m only at power 914
[0:59:48] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt If your a Titan wearing the Help of Saint-14 he'll get super hype about it and suggest pranking Zavala
[0:59:52] <Visorak6> Where do you stand on ana, is she an insufferable mary sue
[0:59:55] <ScreamLord> *Helm
[0:59:55] <$Mothman742> @livestreamonyx and the cap is 1030
[1:00:01] <%WhereIsWill> is power the same as ilvl in 14?
[1:00:04] <Aydarkzero> it's Season of the Worthy time
[1:00:04] <ScreamLord> Meh
[1:00:07] <thelonechris> Because we want you to suffer
[1:00:07] <%DensityD> I like your ship
[1:00:09] <+Andrizzleton> Season of Worthy ResidentSleeper
[1:00:09] <Aydarkzero> she's alright
[1:00:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Zavala seems like the kinda person who would classify his fuck-ups as "fake news"
[1:00:10] <%Nobrev> she cool
[1:00:10] <raknikmik> Banshee catalyst!
[1:00:15] <+raginggayguybd> do you like ana's new VO?
[1:00:17] <%angel949> shes hot
[1:00:17] <%D00msDayDan> they rerecorded all of ana's lines with sloan's VA, she's way better now
[1:00:19] <%Rumbutt> You expect YOUR audience to READ, Pat?
[1:00:23] <%cylish> They dont expect RE6, they just like watching you suffer
[1:00:23] <%LiveStreamOnyx> @mothman742 whoa seriously? Glad to finally know the cap
[1:00:38] <$Mothman742> @livestreamonyx np LuvSign
[1:00:41] <+Reveresao> @PatStaresAt "I hate that I miss Activision" is a top post on the subreddit LUL
[1:00:43] <Sullry> Yeah she got a new voice actor
[1:00:44] <ScreamLord> The game is actually worse with Cayde gone
[1:00:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Did they do that for Cayde too?
[1:00:48] <Helmed> never stop firing
[1:00:49] <Visorak6> I guess we'll hear it in a moment
[1:00:49] <%DensityD> Are you nerfed or not, Pat?
[1:00:56] <%Pyroclase> now hold down the trigger, pat
[1:01:00] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> so Tommy increases damage when it sets itself on fire, but you take damage from it
[1:01:02] <Aydarkzero> @GarbageNirvana his old lines from the base game are the same
[1:01:03] <Tucker0603> don't you shit talk cause. also Ana probably won't be the new hunter vanguard
[1:01:03] <%afronooch> @GarbageNirvana nah
[1:01:08] <+Andrizzleton> Pat, are you fed?
[1:01:09] <Sullry> Also uldren is probably gonna be the hunger vanguard instead of ana
[1:01:10] <%GarbageNirvana> Then why the fuck
[1:01:14] <Visorak6> Yeah thats different
[1:01:18] <%DensityD> THEY LITERALLY HAVE
[1:01:19] <KaliasTV> Who is talking
[1:01:20] <$Mothman742> @patstaresat gun hurts u by the way

[1:01:49] <%squidking96> her hair clipping bothers me
[1:01:51] <%GarbageNirvana> It's just Taeko
[1:01:54] <%GarbageNirvana> It's JUST Taeko
[1:01:56] <%DensityD> just the city
[1:01:58] <Aydarkzero> i like that she calls Rasputin Big Red
[1:02:00] <Saltmeisterr> whats a warmind tho
[1:02:02] <T_Sasquatch> sounds like paige wtf
[1:02:02] <+VariantX7> yeah, just the city.
[1:02:03] <%DensityD> that's all we would lose
[1:02:06] <Saltmeisterr> is that an ai?
[1:02:07] <%DensityD> surely it's only the city
[1:02:08] <%dmtjinni> WAKE UP SHEEPLE
[1:02:09] <T_Sasquatch> is no one else hearing that
[1:02:10] <Tucker0603> yep, quest first
[1:02:15] <Sullry> Bruh
[1:02:17] <+peanutprophet> it begins
[1:02:18] <%Laecerelius> Do some busy work first, Pat!
[1:02:18] <%dekkitout> psaSkelmo Videogamezzz!
[1:02:19] <+mankeyfigh> She’s cute
[1:02:21] <yourliteraldog> Rasputin is cool, he remind of the russian guy who sells me illegal guns irl.
[1:02:26] <+Cardz_> Let the grind begin
[1:02:29] <%DensityD> no new gun yet
[1:02:32] <+Invaderjaymz> just go do the escalation protocol buddy
[1:02:36] <%DensityD> check if you are nerfed
[1:02:46] <%Oxybe> Booze, BBQ Wings, Big Weeds and Boivin. the 4B's to unhealthy living.
[1:02:49] <+raginggayguybd> rip Jamie Chung's VO, you will be missed along with dinklebot
[1:02:53] <KaliasTV> Spawn an EP wave?
[1:02:57] <%angel949> hold trigger
[1:02:58] <%dmtjinni> cod?
[1:02:58] <+Invaderjaymz> keep shooting it
[1:02:59] <%DensityD> CHICAGO "MUTHERFUCKING" TYPEWRITER
[1:03:00] <%king_wragles> That an SMG or AR?
[1:03:04] <Helmed> YEYEYEYE
[1:03:06] <%xUmbraNinja> Cod?
[1:03:15] <%GarbageNirvana> That is absolutely a Tommy Gun
[1:03:21] <Monkeyweed21> dont you have an upgraded kinetic?
[1:03:23] <Sullry> It’s like a 95% damage increase
[1:03:26] <raknikmik> Its an AR
[1:03:28] <%dekkitout> 900rpm ar
[1:03:28] <%D00msDayDan> the fire only hurts your shield and hurts less when you hipfire
[1:03:30] <%king_wragles> ooooh, Combat harness time
[1:03:31] <Sullry> It’s auto
[1:03:37] <$demegodz> Devour Warlock with Tommy's perk is pretty good
[1:03:37] <+aslfrasle> So it's essentially an off-brand, slightly changed Touch of Malice?
[1:03:40] <$demegodz> 98%
[1:03:45] <$Chimeraelite> 98% increase @PatStaresAt in PVE
[1:03:49] <%GarbageNirvana> Finally something else to use with Actium War Rig
[1:03:49] <King_Wolf_Rigger> It should be an SMG since it's a Tommy gun
[1:03:54] <%Pyroclase> it can't take you below 25% hitpoints
[1:03:55] <%Pyroclase> '
[1:03:58] <%dekkitout> Devour also lasts longer now tajLEWD
[1:04:02] <Sullry> The catalyst reduces health regen downtime or something like that
[1:04:05] <Aydarkzero> @PatStaresAt i like using it w/ Devour
[1:04:08] <Monkeyweed21> How's the new season, hearing mixed things so far
[1:04:17] <Sullry> Love using it in wells or rifts as warlock
[1:04:30] <AbnormalEnd> the Seasonal handcannon is so fucking sexy
[1:04:35] <+Cardz_> It begins
[1:04:35] <Sullry> Bruh
[1:04:37] <%WhereIsWill> yeyeyeyeye
[1:04:40] <%theAncopro> we could pretend

[1:05:08] <theredfox930000> how you doing pat
[1:05:14] <%xUmbraNinja> No
[1:05:21] <Aydarkzero> Recluse was adjusted but still feels strong
[1:05:21] <$demegodz> It still good
[1:05:28] <%LiveStreamOnyx> Do you love Recluse more then Paige?
[1:05:39] <%afronooch> They did. You have to aim for the head instead of just at their zip code
[1:05:40] <%thegreenbenis> @LiveStreamOnyx You know that answer.
[1:05:49] <%Laecerelius> because cold boy blew up on you, Pat
[1:05:50] <raknikmik> Pat is talking about not able to infuse the recluse
[1:05:54] <%dekkitout> Mars hive have ice blight
[1:05:55] <+raginggayguybd> better get a move on to the EDZ.

[1:06:12] <+raginggayguybd> pokiYikes pokiYikes
[1:06:16] <%thegreenbenis> @PatStaresAt You'd have to think about it
[1:06:17] <%vectorless_peon> did they unlockTelesto pat?
[1:06:19] <%AmericanaRed> WOW SHES THE ONE
[1:06:21] <+camodikk> camodikk subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! woot
[1:06:21] <+Cardz_> Then he pulls out the recluse from the vault
[1:06:28] <Sullry> Pat then proceeds to go to the collections tab and grabs another
[1:06:53] <%AmericanaRed> unless...
[1:07:02] <Monkeyweed21> I'm pretty sure you can considering she was made in a lab
[1:07:08] <%Shion963> Paige is random rolled
[1:07:12] <%dekkitout> Does Paige take seasonal mods?
[1:07:13] <%LiveStreamOnyx> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:07:13] <%Oxybe> isn't her collections tab a WcDonalds bag?
[1:07:15] <Monkeyweed21> Just Venture Bros clone Paige
[1:07:20] <%Aleate> Just pull a new Paige out of your collections tab Pat
[1:07:20] <%TomDanksEGOT> debatable
[1:07:20] <+Cardz_> nice
[1:07:20] <%NWR_James> You dont know that Pat. It could be on the marriage titty
[1:07:24] <%AmericanaRed> Isn't she an ada clone?
[1:07:25] <+mankeyfigh> Okay, but if Paige was only going to take 10% damage?
[1:07:28] <KaliasTV> Paige has random rolls so you can't get another one
[1:07:28] <%vectorless_peon> I wish SO's had a collections tab

[1:09:42] <%OToole42> if item power = X trash
[1:09:51] <betrayed_llama> LUL

[1:11:14] <%Nobrev> I haven't really played this game since the dreaming city first became a the
[1:11:38] <%Nobrev> thing* what's the best way to get back in
[1:11:45] <%Pyroclase> The Dreaming City was the best part of Destiny's history anyway
[1:11:46] <Monkeyweed21> Ra ra Rasputin lover of the Orb Queen
[1:12:05] <KingVantq> not getting back in because it got worse :)
[1:12:05] <$demegodz> Yeah just change of name

[1:12:32] <%Oxybe> Pah Pah Patsputin, lover of the Mustard Queen
[1:12:37] <%dekkitout> Even though it was the spike grenade perk that was the problem....
[1:12:37] <Tucker0603> ohhhh
[1:12:44] <Sullry> Pat when you get into the Rasputin room look down over the edge
[1:12:48] <%king_wragles> Man, that's a coool AR
[1:13:10] <Monkeyweed21> plorbo
[1:13:32] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Dude that exotic with devour perk on warlock is op
[1:13:50] <karl_rex> Oof
[1:13:51] <$demegodz> oooh
[1:13:51] <%Nobrev> RIP
[1:13:53] <Charronia> rooSlain
[1:13:58] <Tucker0603> fucked
[1:14:00] <%arcaderabbit48> This game seems boring
[1:14:04] <%dekkitout> Open up with rift, then consume orb
[1:14:04] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> though you need to kill enemies pat...
[1:14:06] <%MajorCrasher> nice one stumbo
[1:14:12] <%angel949> enemies take damage when you shoot them
[1:14:12] <%thegreenbenis> Oof
[1:14:15] <%Nobrev> RIP again
[1:14:16] <+Andrizzleton> gun looks whack
[1:14:19] <$demegodz> High Risk
[1:14:24] <+mankeyfigh> Didn’t this game have really fun puzzle and boss raids?
[1:14:34] <T_Sasquatch> @arcaderabbit48 yeah bbut its pretty
[1:14:36] <%dekkitout> Might as well use Riskrunner and call it a day
[1:14:36] <Tucker0603> high risk high reward
[1:14:47] <%Aleate> It looks cool, but seems not great compared to even the Symmetry
[1:14:55] <bxdragon> With splash damage from some enemies attack taking almost all your health can't say the risk is worth.
[1:14:55] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Riskrunner is pointless without eletric
[1:14:59] <Monkeyweed21> Hey Pat, if it makes you feel any better immediately after making fun of you for swallowing a bayleaf whole I got spicy soup right in my eyeball, Karma hasn't forsaken you yet
[1:15:05] <%dekkitout> You can self proc with grenades
[1:15:10] <karl_rex> Can really hear the Taeko there
[1:15:11] <%MajorCrasher> yeah all the fun puzzle and boss raids are a chore because the refuse to put in matchmaking for it for some reason
[1:15:15] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> the question is why the hell would I use Tommy over Sweet Business?
[1:15:21] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @Monkeyweed21 the power of crazy talk my friend
[1:15:31] <%arcaderabbit48> So is Rasputin the giant pyramid?

[1:15:40] <%xUmbraNinja> Holy shit
[1:15:41] <%Pyroclase> Why does she call him big red? He is orange.
[1:15:50] <Charronia> He might be distracted by something more fun than saving the world rooShrug
[1:15:53] <%Shion963> he's Russian
[1:15:53] <+peanutprophet> has pat tried the new sword changes out? they look really weird
[1:16:00] <+VariantX7> ok, those are new.

[1:16:08] <Monkeyweed21> He Big Orb
[1:16:08] <%thegreenbenis> FUCK THAT LOOKS COOL
[1:16:09] <%dekkitout> That Red Space cloud is Ras
[1:16:09] <Aydarkzero> Pat look down
[1:16:10] <Sullry> Look down over the edge in the room
[1:16:13] <%Pyroclase> that is clearly orange though
[1:16:20] <%Reaviar> Tommy is really fun when you have the new titan exotic
[1:16:21] <%Oxybe> Dats a big square
[1:16:23] <%king_wragles> I forgot Rasputin speaks in HORROR
[1:16:28] <YakumoYomi> Alright...this actually looks pretty fun.
[1:16:33] <%arcaderabbit48> But why tho
[1:16:39] <Visorak6> There's something mildly terrifying about humans electing to build an AI that huge
[1:16:41] <Tucker0603> it's redish orange

[1:24:09] <FennecZephyr> Matchbook seems like it isn't bad if you have a healing source
[1:24:10] <%Rumbutt> Maybe Last Word getting nerfed right after you get it is an unanticipated effect of Crazy Talk? "Man, this gun is great!" Crazy Talk activates, and now it's your fault for saying it was good

[2:05:13] <%dekkitout> Pat has Revoker, right?
[2:05:22] <%rooooooooooot> youre the snapshot king
[2:05:36] <Tucker0603> revoker is sexy I love it
[2:05:41] <Visorak6> Revoker is a grind
[2:05:44] <%dekkitout> Woof
[2:05:50] <%WhereIsWill> pat no scope MLG
[2:05:51] <%GarbageNirvana> Fuck those quests for real
[2:05:55] <$demegodz> @PatStaresAt Momentum Control
[2:05:57] <$demegodz> Next time
[2:06:00] <$demegodz> It comes around
[2:06:03] <%rooooooooooot> thats a sexy gun
[2:06:08] <%Keeble24> Keeble24 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! YO PAT! Love your streams as always! Gonna be able to catch your streams now. I’m injured and stuck at home.
[2:06:09] <Pnutz409> they have gun quests!?
[2:06:09] <+Shubreaker> no rip
[2:06:10] <Visorak6> tbh by the end of the revoker grind I got a lot better with snipers and made me appreciate it more
[2:06:11] <$demegodz> Nope
[2:06:12] <Tucker0603> no
[2:06:13] <grayphoenix564> That was a sexy gun
[2:06:15] <%Aleate> It might as well be
[2:06:19] <$demegodz> But next time it comes
[2:06:23] <%Rumbutt> Pat remember to weave your melee or grenade cooldown into your reload animation to improve your parse Kappa
[2:06:24] <$demegodz> Go get sniper kills
[2:06:26] <%dekkitout> Chaperone continues to avoid the nerf hammer ThankEgg
[2:06:29] <+Shubreaker> it really should be
[2:06:36] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @grayphoenix564 NO YOU are a sexy gun
[2:06:43] <%GarbageNirvana> I feel like effective sniper rifle usage requires you to have a greater knowledge of the maps than I care to burn the brain space on
[2:06:46] <%TIME_PUNCHER> sniper rifles are the worst. there a weapon built around camping in a community that despises camping
[2:07:07] <%dekkitout> Most likely, they'll limit the infusion like in D1
[2:07:07] <+Shubreaker> is it wrong to assume pinnacles won't be touched
[2:07:08] <+Pharmakokinetic> revoker? damn near killed her
[2:07:09] <$demegodz> True but it gives you somthing to chase in the moment
[2:07:21] <grayphoenix564> @Bane_Kaikyo Say things like that and I'll end up touching ya HahaShrugRight
[2:07:24] <NiktenKing> Revoker is just strong cause always have ammo on miss, so for the time it is worth it
[2:07:26] <%xxshadowxx416> they are
[2:07:28] <%GalacticaPhanto> bro, I'm so confused on D2 stuff but I love all that's going on
[2:07:29] <$demegodz> They have been before?
[2:07:36] <+Kyma1020> Eh I’d still get it
[2:07:36] <%TIME_PUNCHER> "She revoked my K/D ratio so i revoked her SOUL"
[2:07:37] <%angel949> but you will still be able to use it in regular crucible
[2:07:45] <$demegodz> Ritual weapons
[2:07:45] <Sullry> It’s only gonna be power level stuff not like they’re gonna get rid of it completely
[2:07:47] <$demegodz> Won't be
[2:07:52] <%dekkitout> Fatebringer was behind a long ass grind, that didn't help it...
[2:07:56] <Monkeyweed21> remember breakneck Pat
[2:08:05] <$demegodz> Pinnicles were already touched
[2:08:11] <$demegodz> They fucked Breakneck
[2:08:13] <raknikmik> breakneck got buffed again fude
[2:08:15] <tigerstyle96> Where does one start in this game @patstaresat

[2:08:26] <NiktenKing> yes
[2:08:27] <raknikmik> Gof buffed twice
[2:08:35] <$demegodz> Not as good but waaaaay better
[2:08:36] <%dekkitout> Breakneck gets a few indirect buffs
[2:08:46] <%TIME_PUNCHER> breakneck is the Sonic of destiny
[2:08:52] <NiktenKing> Green boi
[2:08:53] <grayphoenix564> @Bane_Kaikyo xcalSmeagz You know it is
[2:09:06] <%MajorCrasher> this is why I can't stick with destiny. shit gets buffed and nerfed at the drop of a hat

[2:10:09] <%Rumbutt> MP5... in space
[2:10:16] <%TIME_PUNCHER> blat blat, booyaka booyaka
[2:10:19] <Sullry> This map used to be my SHIT back in d1
[2:10:21] <%gespenst25> MP5 is a really nice gun
[2:10:22] <NiktenKing> Isnt Rasputin AR just an AK?
[2:10:37] <Aydarkzero> Moon Maps from d1 Kreygasm
[2:10:44] <%dekkitout> Things get rebalanced every 3-5 months, that amount of time's relative
[2:10:46] <%TIME_PUNCHER> that was a BREAKNECK death aaaaaaaaaa
[2:10:50] <ScreamLord> I see sniper flinch is still the absolute worst thing in the game
[2:10:53] <%MajorCrasher> yeah but it feels like something is constantly being changed

[2:11:26] <%dekkitout> This map could fuck off for salvage in D1
[2:11:30] <%코코꾸라> With the multiplayer that had vehicles
[2:11:34] <NiktenKing> Yes
[2:11:38] <$demegodz> Ehhh
[2:11:38] <raknikmik> Breakneck mostly for PvE yeah
[2:11:41] <$demegodz> Yeah not for PvP
[2:11:44] <%TIME_PUNCHER> back in the TRASH
[2:12:16] <%Nope80808> I like the realistic aesthic of all gambit weapons
[2:12:19] <%TIME_PUNCHER> sneeky

[2:14:48] <mastertwin2> I killed this guy :)
[2:14:49] <NiktenKing> the map is good, but not for this many people

[2:14:59] <%MoralCompassGaming> yeah, i figured it was a jojo reference but Pat was responding as if it were why, not wryy
[2:15:07] <Visorak6> shotguns are jumpscares in this game
[2:15:13] <Monkeyweed21> AngriestPat would have finished RE6 by now
[2:15:15] <NiktenKing> 3v3 map for sure
[2:15:37] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Angriest Pat is dark side, Pat Stares At is light side. Pat Angry At is the grey jedi way

[2:22:32] <Tucker0603> look at the back of it

[2:23:48] <fidorulz> @visorak6 I work in a call center. best place to get it
[2:23:54] <Aydarkzero> @PatStaresAt read the flavor text
[2:23:56] <$demegodz> For the creeps
[2:23:58] <%xUmbraNinja> Helmet stares at
[2:23:58] <%dekkitout> Because Felwinter was a SKETCHY ASS dude
[2:23:59] <LillethBlue> Eyes on the inside
[2:24:04] <Tucker0603> @patstaresat because felwinter was a bit nutty
[2:24:07] <raknikmik> Read the lore
[2:24:09] <%TIME_PUNCHER> AI in the back of your head
[2:24:17] <Visorak6> It suppresses?
[2:24:20] <%MoralCompassGaming> also a guy i'm living with might be infected as he has a fever, cough and some other symptom i can't remember. been locking myself in my room when i don't need to leave it
[2:24:31] <NiktenKing> use the helmet on top tree Dawnblade
[2:24:32] <$demegodz> Hmm
[2:24:34] <%dekkitout> Bigger enemy = bigger explosion
[2:24:34] <%maskofmichael> Was Pat literally just playing dress up while being shot at?
[2:24:35] <%Aleate> Oh, so it's the crappy Titan exotic from last season. cool.
[2:24:36] <%xUmbraNinja> Lol
[2:24:39] <%MoralCompassGaming> he went to the clinic so he shoudl get results soonish
[2:24:48] <+nekodelic> dry cough or not?
[2:24:52] <%MoralCompassGaming> yeah
[2:24:56] <%radda343> welcome to destiny
[2:24:59] <grayphoenix564> MoralCompass the virus is airborne so if you're near him you're pretty much fucked
[2:25:01] <+nekodelic> jesus
[2:25:01] <NiktenKing> Top tree dawnblade with monte carlo means buffs for days
[2:25:09] <NiktenKing> or rather debuffs
[2:25:19] <+Shubreaker> jiump
[2:25:23] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Moral, the third symptom is typically shortness of breath
[2:25:25] <koolkatdq> Hungry box has more viewers than pat right now
[2:25:49] <%MoralCompassGaming> well he's still smoking so i don't imagine he has that
[2:25:49] <%vectorless_peon> the way twitch sychs its feed ruins music
[2:25:56] <NiktenKing> Read it
[2:26:06] <%xUmbraNinja> Beat it
[2:26:09] <%TIME_PUNCHER> reading is for NERDS
[2:26:09] <Visorak6> Point defenses?
[2:26:23] <fidorulz> problem is the incubation period prior to getting symptoms and the fact it's airborne as well. many say this will be like the cold or flu. never really goes away but most of the population will get it eventually
[2:26:28] <%TIME_PUNCHER> this aint no anime visual novel dating sim
[2:26:37] <%TIME_PUNCHER> no read, only shoot
[2:26:42] <$demegodz> Complex time
[2:26:53] <NiktenKing> You can just buy it
[2:27:12] <koolkatdq> Is destiny good now
[2:27:20] <%코코꾸라> weird flex but ok
[2:27:21] <Daxalog> Was destiny bad?
[2:27:22] <%vectorless_peon> this corona is much more leathal to people a young as 40 though bye bye boomers
[2:27:22] <%TIME_PUNCHER> buy guns like god intended
[2:27:36] <%rooooooooooot> 👃
[2:27:41] <%dekkitout> That seems like a reasonable reaction to what we did with the fractiline donations LUL
[2:27:49] <$demegodz> OOOH
[2:28:01] <koolkatdq> I heard it wasn’t but also not good
[2:28:02] <fidorulz> @vectorless_peon that's if it doesn't mutate
[2:28:04] <NiktenKing> You didn't even read the bunker upgrade screen,so it's even MORE complicated
[2:28:07] <%Pyroclase> So this is a PL 980 event and people still suck at it
[2:28:18] <RazielTheDark> Will let you know this now, you throw the orange balls into the big orange ball to move it, also keep enemies away from towers for more balls
[2:28:30] <%Pyroclase> you need to pick up abtteries and yeet them at the ball
[2:28:40] <thecrazyestminer> Pat throw balls
[2:28:46] <Neo_Kaiser> Oh wow, E3 was just cancelled. I guess that means no games will be coming out in the next year.
[2:28:51] <%xUmbraNinja> Pat shoot dog
[2:28:58] <NiktenKing> Forges+Control
[2:29:03] <%DensityD> shoot licker
[2:29:19] <raknikmik> Throw balls into the orange ball tl move it along
[2:29:19] <koolkatdq> No e3 lytKILLGOKU
[2:29:20] <%TIME_PUNCHER> there havent been good games for years anyway, Kaiser
[2:29:21] <+Shubreaker> CrabRave E3 CANCELLED CrabRave
[2:29:23] <ExpressNode> E3 would have been cancelled anyway because of its irrelevancy
[2:29:31] <thecrazyestminer> Yeah this public event is very weird
[2:29:40] <%vectorless_peon> @fidorulz honestly im hoping for a more competitive varient without the letality, viruses are parasites and parasites like thier hoasts alive so they can reproduce much more over the long term
[2:29:41] <%rooooooooooot> thank god no more e3
[2:29:41] <Neo_Kaiser> Titanfall 2
[2:29:42] <Aydarkzero> it's nice
[2:29:45] <NiktenKing> You can save two balls for the next one if you do it optimal
[2:29:54] <%dekkitout> I love how Perfect Paradox is a problem solver
[2:29:55] <fidorulz> they where saying in China many children have it but don't seem to get symptoms which is odd
[2:30:02] <%Fatmanjoggin> Old Russian tech sure is weird
[2:30:13] <%radda343> congrats on the blue for shooting that shank for an hour
[2:30:17] <thecrazyestminer> This looks cool though
[2:30:18] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Titanfall 2 isnt a game its an experience so it doesn't count
[2:30:18] <TheArrow_> What if this was the Dragon's Dogma 2 E3 and now we'll never get it
[2:30:25] <icemochablunt> prove you're not a lizard in human skin
[2:30:32] <EuropanLamprey> All I know is "Ball Good" and rape
[2:30:35] <%dekkitout> Oh god wait- can new players encounter this? LUL
[2:30:38] <%rooooooooooot> ball big
[2:30:43] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @PatStaresAt In order to get more balls to pop out, you need to clear the platform of enemies
[2:30:49] <%TIME_PUNCHER> all ball shots all the time
[2:30:53] <RazielTheDark> @PatStaresAt Enemies here are 980, was why I said enjoy trying to do this now
[2:30:53] <$demegodz> Spread ball
[2:30:56] <Neo_Kaiser> What if Destiny 3 was going to be announced?
[2:30:59] <%angel949> throw ball into ball to move ball
[2:31:01] <%MoralCompassGaming> @EuropanLamprey HAND-BANANA NO!
[2:31:02] <%코코꾸라> BALL
[2:31:06] <$demegodz> OH BALL
[2:31:07] <karl_rex> BAAAAALLLLL
[2:31:07] <%fetrigon> Looks like digital marketers just got a lot more relevant
[2:31:08] <aimlesshealer> Balls in my ass!
[2:31:08] <shurtal> ORB
[2:31:09] <NiktenKing> Is Pat a dog now?
[2:31:09] <+Shubreaker> GRAB BALL PAT
[2:31:09] <Monkeyweed21> This Orb was made for you
[2:31:11] <%TIME_PUNCHER> NBA Destiny 2k
[2:31:14] <trbrovah> if destiny 4 was announced it would be met with a dull wimper
[2:31:25] <%EarleRiser> Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball.
[2:31:25] <%realm_forge> Less enemies on pad = more ball
[2:31:28] <koolkatdq> Games can be shown at other place than just e3
[2:31:42] <%vectorless_peon> @fidorulz there are actually a lot of dieases like that that only manifest for people in various life stages, sometimes there are entire nursereys infected with some nasty bug that makes only the caretakers sick
[2:31:50] <+Shubreaker> has pat figured out how well verity
[2:31:55] <%ghostydash> Ball, aaaaaaahhhh
[2:31:58] <%TIME_PUNCHER> hide your balls
[2:32:02] <%Pyroclase> so this event is actually hard
[2:32:05] <thecrazyestminer> Is it just me or is ana’s va different
[2:32:05] <%Maids4lyfe> no you didn't fuck up, it's supposed to keep goin
[2:32:06] <+Shubreaker> *how well verity's brow pairs with tommy
[2:32:07] <%Maids4lyfe> g
[2:32:10] <%juxtest> Did it finally happen? Did players finally kill so many Fallen that all they have left are Shanks?
[2:32:10] <NiktenKing> it's actually easy
[2:32:11] <+HDmexiqtioner> Hey Pat, Hey Paige, Hello Chat. I'ma draw while you play. :)
[2:32:11] <$demegodz> You did ball
[2:32:19] <NiktenKing> you just need people
[2:32:19] <%afronooch> its only hard cause people are underleveled
[2:32:26] <RazielTheDark> It only hard due to the light level standard being 980, once we shoot past that, should be easy enough
[2:32:27] <Monkeyweed21> AngriestPat would have done it
[2:32:34] <koolkatdq> Hi draw person
[2:32:39] <RazielTheDark> Just difficult to keep high resist enemies off the towers
[2:32:43] <%Fatmanjoggin> success rate is real low right now
[2:32:48] <Helmed> ive lost 6 times in a row. dont worry
[2:32:51] <%Pyroclase> this event is like 980
[2:32:52] <MasterDecoder> Was
[2:32:53] <%코코꾸라> Yeah but the events are 980
[2:32:54] <raknikmik> It's 980
[2:32:54] <+A0N33> Power for that event is 980
[2:32:56] <%Shion963> apparently it needs 1k?
[2:32:57] <+Shubreaker> seraph is 980
[2:32:58] <Tucker0603> the light for it is 980
[2:33:04] <%dekkitout> "!" on enemies means they have a bigger number
[2:33:06] <%Pyroclase> and you're used to being ABOVE enemy power
[2:33:10] <%xUmbraNinja> 007
[2:33:13] <NiktenKing> Keep plates clear, get balls, throw balls, if you do optimal rotations, you have two balls saved for next tower immediately
[2:33:25] <thecrazyestminer> You were under level
[2:33:36] <+HDmexiqtioner> I'm surprised this isn't warframe you are playing. Did Destiny comeout with something or just a pick up?
[2:33:39] <%vectorless_peon> @HDmexiqtioner draw boobs!
[2:33:39] <%afronooch> yep. so once you hit like 970 ish most enemies dont do extra damage to you
[2:33:40] <RazielTheDark> Good luck trying to do the new legendary lost sectors which are now apparently 1000
[2:33:49] <+Shubreaker> @HDmexiqtioner new season
[2:33:58] <%dekkitout> They seem more involved unlike how EP was a slog of bullet repositories
[2:34:08] <Aydarkzero> get the far left one on t1
[2:34:08] <+HDmexiqtioner> @vectorless_peon well, honestly kinda what I'm working on. It's a commission for a buddy of mine.
[2:34:12] <+HDmexiqtioner> lol
[2:34:18] <%vectorless_peon> yeeeah
[2:34:18] <NiktenKing> Get the last one first
[2:34:30] <%Pyroclase> The last one decreases the cost of all the others
[2:34:37] <%afronooch> do event our bounties for bits like Vex Offensive
[2:34:41] <%afronooch> *or
[2:34:50] <+TheBeanHole> TheBeanHole subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:34:56] <Monkeyweed21> farm bitcoins Orblo
[2:35:03] <RazielTheDark> @PatStaresAt A reminder that this is 1 bunker, while there is 2 more, so a lot of grind incoming
[2:35:06] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> Legendary Lost Sectors are LL 1k right now
[2:35:23] <NiktenKing> @PatStaresAt They mislabeled it as cache codes, it's actually Encrypted Bits you get from daily bounties
[2:35:34] <%vectorless_peon> Pat, Remove Choas!
[2:36:03] <1matheuw> shoot the gun pat
[2:36:03] <%MoralCompassGaming> FUCKING AMAZING. i just looked up the trip the infected guy took. He rode the same metro as i did, both yellow and Orange lines. i now currently have a very real chance of being infected and will only know by the 20th for sure.
[2:36:18] <%MoralCompassGaming> the same trains, at the same times.
[2:36:24] <+Radiantomega> legendary lost sectors are light level 1k
[2:36:26] <%dekkitout> psaSkelmo
[2:36:27] <+Shubreaker> pat grab verity's brow for maximum cheese
[2:36:29] <%cureneckbeard> don't touch your face laff
[2:36:40] <%vectorless_peon> I really wish D2 was a 40k game, that would get me into it
[2:36:41] <%xUmbraNinja> Zombie
[2:36:42] <1matheuw> corona virus aint even that dangerous my guys dont panic
[2:36:46] <%xUmbraNinja> psaDab
[2:36:53] <%MoralCompassGaming> @cureneckbeard i was just face-palming and then freaked out
[2:37:07] <%dekkitout> Verity's brow with a subsistence/demolitonist gnawing hunger BlessRNG
[2:37:13] <TheArrow_> @MoralCompassGaming don't die, okay?
[2:37:14] <%silvervsync> my two fav things back again, pat and D2
[2:37:15] <1matheuw> just chill and be mindfull as to not infect anyone else
[2:37:39] <%xUmbraNinja> get Smoked
[2:37:39] <%vectorless_peon> @1matheuw its many times more dangerous than the flu though 3.4 is compaired to 0.2 deathtoll
[2:37:49] <mike_wate> Pat rules
[2:37:57] <$demegodz> Pat picking up the litter
[2:37:59] <%xUmbraNinja> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:38:10] <%vectorless_peon> % that is
[2:38:34] <NiktenKing> LUL
[2:38:36] <$demegodz> LUL
[2:38:37] <$demegodz> PAT
[2:38:41] <%xUmbraNinja> LUL
[2:38:42] <Monkeyweed21> AngriestPat would have hit
[2:39:11] <%vectorless_peon> @1matheuw also hand washing aint gonna do it, you can get infected just from someone's breath
[2:39:14] <%dekkitout> Man- why couldn't we've had this gun when lunafactions were busted PepeHands
[2:39:29] <%xUmbraNinja> Doing it
[2:39:40] <1matheuw> @vectorless_peon yeah and masks wont protect you either
[2:39:56] <+Shubreaker> @dekkitout coldheart/prometheus lens were bad enough
[2:39:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hey chat or pat, maybe you can help me....whats the appeal of this game? I tried it for like 20 hours or so and I didn't get into it
[2:40:02] <%cureneckbeard> masks are mainly for stopping you from infecting other people
[2:40:04] <1matheuw> but most of the early deaths were because of the lack of information
[2:40:06] <%californaya> Make number go up.
[2:40:07] <%vectorless_peon> @1matheuw also you wont even know you have it untill 3 weeks during which you are spreading it
[2:40:08] <NiktenKing> Now pick a side Pat
[2:40:09] <Unimpressions> It feels good to shoot stuff @doc_ock_rokc
[2:40:10] <%californaya> That's the appeal.
[2:40:12] <%SoFarFetched> Think you need a good group of people for this gamea.
[2:40:16] <%cureneckbeard> number go up
[2:40:18] <%xUmbraNinja> It’s pew pew in the doo doo
[2:40:18] <%SoFarFetched> or else it wont' stick
[2:40:19] <RazielTheDark> Yeah make number go up, and weapons
[2:40:24] <%californaya> Some people like the shooting. I gave it a few hours, I think it's just fine.
[2:40:37] <Heyestus> Because the plot demands it
[2:40:39] <MasterDecoder> JUST FUCK ALREADY
[2:40:39] <NiktenKing> Which side of the line Pat
[2:40:40] <Monkeyweed21> You literally have no reason to djstrust Rasputin
[2:40:42] <+mankeyfigh> Is the story garbage?
[2:40:49] <%juxtest> Zavala didn't leave the Tower to NOT blow up a giant robot
[2:40:57] <+dawsfloss> Looks like E3 2020 is canceled LUL
[2:41:01] <%californaya> It was one of those games that are "fun with friends" but even my friends stopped playing so
[2:41:04] <%dekkitout> Eh- Rasputin has some skeletons in his closet
[2:41:06] <%xUmbraNinja> Good LUL
[2:41:12] <%TaifuDragon> @Monkeyweed21 except for those logs where it was definitely considering gunning down the traveller
[2:41:14] <NiktenKing> Pat didn't take a side of the argument CRISIS AVERTED
[2:41:16] <MasterDecoder> They left
[2:41:27] <MasterDecoder> Transmat is a thing for all Guardians PAt
[2:41:28] <%Shion963> Rasputin let humanity die
[2:41:47] <majindusto> That dudes voice sounds SO DAMN FAMILIAR...and i don't know from where?
[2:41:50] <%TaifuDragon> Yeah, he also totally quit the field to preserve himself when the darkness came
[2:41:57] <mike_wate> Where is the music coming from
[2:42:05] <MasterDecoder> Bunker Upgrades Pat
[2:42:11] <+mankeyfigh> I mean Nintendo and Sony will just do some directs
[2:42:12] <%TaifuDragon> @mike_wate rasputin likes music

[2:42:30] <%maskofmichael> Right now?
[2:42:30] <%vectorless_peon> @1matheuw and another thing the 3.4% figure i saw accounted for that, if you are over 40 there is serious concern to be justifyably had.
[2:42:31] <$demegodz> PReview on the Upgrades
[2:42:34] <NiktenKing> NO
[2:42:36] <%ElkRiverDog> @majindusto he’s in horizon zero dawn

[2:42:50] <DagetStreams> Whaddaya mean "now"?
[2:43:03] <%Pyroclase> I really don't like that this system is SO complex and there's only like, 4 guns that drop from it
[2:43:15] <$demegodz> Grind tim
[2:43:20] <$demegodz> Time
[2:43:29] <%dekkitout> Yeah, this reeks of illusion of depth
[2:43:35] <%xUmbraNinja> Go Tim
[2:43:39] <NiktenKing> Get the upgrade one the far right for each row first
[2:43:44] <NiktenKing> *on
[2:44:01] <+akira_chong> So with all of these cancellations, does anyone think they're gonna cancel EVO this year?
[2:44:07] <KaliasTV> Every new system they add is overly complicated, I still hate the new armor stats
[2:44:09] <NiktenKing> Yes
[2:44:10] <raknikmik> Yup
[2:44:11] <MasterDecoder> Eh
[2:44:12] <Visorak6> I blieve so
[2:44:16] <%Pyroclase> they're only for turning in AFAIK
[2:44:18] <MasterDecoder> Need more than one
[2:44:20] <RazielTheDark> You exchange those to level the bunker
[2:44:21] <$demegodz> Yes
[2:44:22] <+mankeyfigh> What’s max power now?
[2:44:22] <$demegodz> Oh

[2:44:33] <$demegodz> START GRINDING BUD

[2:44:42] <$demegodz> that
[2:44:45] <LillethBlue> Do what you do best - grind

[2:45:57] <Visorak6> If you had some buds you could probably nightfall style it
[2:46:00] <%xxshadowxx416> no justvgrind
[2:46:01] <RazielTheDark> The only people that would be doing those this week are the sweats
[2:46:04] <raknikmik> You can do it quite easily with 3 guys at 970 power
[2:46:05] <LillethBlue> @solidousstream I wish. Also, it was over before it even began lol
[2:46:18] <KaliasTV> There'll be someone with 1000 from the artifact by like... tomorrow

[2:47:20] <RazielTheDark> The new activity is only in the Winding Cove for EDZ, there is the same event also on Io and The Moon
[2:47:21] <%Pyroclase> it's basically EP, you push E to start the thing
[2:47:22] <karl_rex> The moment I want to get back into this game it hits me with another light level I have no reason to reach
[2:47:22] <%dekkitout> Cap is like 1010 or some shit
[2:47:25] <BlueSpartan119> 1010
[2:47:28] <NiktenKing> You need to complete bounties to get the encrypted bits from the bounties to open chests like Escalation Protocol
[2:47:29] <MasterDecoder> 1010 I think
[2:47:31] <trbrovah> yah gotta wait like another month for the other two to grind the same shit all over again
[2:47:33] <%xUmbraNinja> 1010 man
[2:47:40] <RazielTheDark> Oh wow
[2:47:43] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> hehehe

[2:48:56] <%dekkitout> The game was always supposed to throw you into populated instances, but population was the problem after some given time
[2:48:58] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @PatStaresAt if you hit the flag if there isn't one going on, you get sent into a lobby with people
[2:49:04] <cookiewar> u want tips for the event?

[2:49:35] <Macallai> @PatStaresAt Yo dude! Takes 20 rounds to activate the burn, and you take less damage from the burn while hipfiring, just a quick tip!
[2:49:47] <%xUmbraNinja> SHOOT BALL
[2:49:47] <Monkeyweed21> holding ball
[2:49:53] <RazielTheDark> Something about Big Reds satellites being in deep space taking too long to come back, so you have to create new ones here
[2:50:07] <mike_wate> Ball
[2:50:12] <%juxtest> Why is that Captain so big
[2:50:20] <$demegodz> Hes a big boi

[2:51:17] <Monkeyweed21> Does Pat just play Destiny cuz of all the Orbs?
[2:51:26] <Macallai> @patstaresat It's in the center of the active support tower, you only have a few seconds to grab it though, after the platform drops balls.
[2:51:54] <RazielTheDark> Wow, you might actually get this one

[2:53:17] <%Shion963> so much currencies
[2:53:18] <%juxtest> You're too poor for Rasputin to reward you for your efforts
[2:53:20] <cookiewar> via bounties
[2:53:26] <+raginggayguybd> there is no cap on the dailys
[2:53:27] <%angel949> that's it
[2:53:29] <NiktenKing> @PatStaresAt You need to complete bounties to get EncryptedBits, they mislabeled it as cache codeds earlier when they explained
[2:53:37] <+raginggayguybd> its just gonna be a long long grind.
