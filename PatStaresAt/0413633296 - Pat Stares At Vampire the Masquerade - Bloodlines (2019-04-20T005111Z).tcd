[0:05:16] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Atheistpreacher thanks, good to know
[0:05:18] <emillionghost> heaether good
[0:05:24] <%spiritofmojave> Friday night BLEH
[0:05:30] <%cervidaequus> cervidaequus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! a whole year of worshipping at the altar of elmo! yeah!!!
[0:05:33] <@lewdskeletor13> @depressed_skeleton Nooo he is a cute baby apatElmo
[0:05:33] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> also @everyone else ya'll wrong, 14 years have not been kind on that woman
[0:05:47] <%ElenaManetta> I was watching American Dad, but I'll go and watch my Canadian Dad instead
[0:05:53] <NocturnalRites> oh no I'm torn between watching the stream and playing Bloodlines myself
[0:05:56] <Atheistpreacher> Cute, except for those wacky eyebrows
[0:06:00] <+TheWallOfMeat> do both at once, Nocturnal
[0:06:04] <@lewdskeletor13> Canadian Dad is better anyway apatDab
[0:06:10] <nawadap136> actually what im doing rn
[0:06:13] <emillionghost> this game loves red heads
[0:06:16] <%depressed_skeleton> @lewdskeletor13 But if you defeat him, then YOU will be cute baby.
[0:06:31] <@lewdskeletor13> I’ve notice this game almost exclusively has red headed females
[0:06:35] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @ElenaManetta I got confused and thought Matt was streaming
[0:06:39] <NocturnalRites> also Heather looks best with her default outfit everything else just looks bad
[0:06:51] <$RubberFistFight> why do eyes and eyelashes grow in such a way that when one of the latter falls out it IMMEDIATELY spears into the soft, yielding, supple and moist surface of the former?
[0:06:52] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @NocturnalRites that goth look is shit
[0:06:57] <$RubberFistFight> It's fucking bullshit.
[0:07:08] <$Billyuppercut0> cheer1050 Are you going to download the VTM Unofficial patch on your possible second run Pat?
[0:07:16] <emillionghost> @RubberFistFight thats hot
[0:07:29] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @RubberFistFight it is the price you pay for eye protection
[0:07:31] <Ner234> @lewdskeletor13 Where you always a mod and I just never noticed? Or is that recent?
[0:07:35] <Atheistpreacher> I think he's running the UO patch, jsut not the plus patch
[0:07:40] <NocturnalRites> @Billyuppercut0 Do you mean the plus patch?
[0:07:44] <$RubberFistFight> @emillionghost well you'd think so but i'm basically blind in my right eye while I fish this traitorous motherfucker out.
[0:07:46] <$Billyuppercut0> Yeah
[0:07:51] <%Wrashis> i think the maker of the unofficial patch told pat to use the non beta patch]
[0:07:54] <@lewdskeletor13> @ner234 Just happened today. I’m a trial mod in the Discord
[0:07:54] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah I think it's Plus patch and Unofficial in tandem
[0:08:04] <HeadsHeldHigh> I hate how even if you are reluctant in letting Heather in, you still only get creepy "my pet" conversation options
[0:08:08] <Ner234> @lewdskeletor13 Ah I see. That's cool.
[0:08:09] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Yeah pat is running the standard unofficial patch from GOG i think
[0:08:10] <$cureneckbeard> What are everyone's favourite Pat noises?
[0:08:17] <$RubberFistFight> @Youwereeatenbyalid but they don't need to kamikaze-dive right into the surface of my eyeball every time, surely.
[0:08:19] <FrenchTact1cs> 4/20
[0:08:23] <NocturnalRites> the default state of the GOG and Steam is the unofficial patch
[0:08:30] <%spiritofmojave> @cureneckbeard wheezing cough fit from yesterday was good
[0:08:41] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @RubberFistFight you trade regular and infrequent pain for irregular and incredibly frequent pain
[0:08:41] <+hkey_local_machine> "wha....!?!?"
[0:08:43] <emillionghost> @cureneckbeard i like the soft oohs
[0:08:49] <NeoOneShin> i don't like plus patch, no sir
[0:08:53] <%joylent_blue> pat's particular brand of gleeful squealing
[0:08:53] <@lewdskeletor13> His laugh during the “its growing” part killed me
[0:08:58] <Atheistpreacher> I love just how quickly Pat jumped into his role as creeper and started exploiting heather after acting so uncomfortable about it
[0:08:59] <%NobleJedi> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:09:04] <%spiritofmojave> IT'S GROWING ANRI
[0:09:08] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @lewdskeletor13 BOOOOOBS
[0:09:11] <$RubberFistFight> @cureneckbeard the laugh that burst out of him when Paige got slammed by the electric gargoyle and then nailed by the anor londo archer seconds later.
[0:09:12] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Atheistpreacher he's not a creeper, he's a pimp
[0:09:13] <1matheuw> the stream bugged for me
[0:09:16] <NocturnalRites> I like the plus patch for how much it adds but the removal of the book trick is slightly irritating
[0:09:24] <$cureneckbeard> I like when he grunts when exerting himself, pretending to exert himself in a game, or dabbing
[0:09:27] <Ner234> "IT'S GROWING" * Pat wheezing intensifies* LUL
[0:09:28] <$cureneckbeard> "enh"
[0:09:29] <InugamiTheHound> hey everyone. I'm back and I had a lot fun with yakuza 6 stream(I didn't stay for all of ti but most of it)
[0:09:30] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @NocturnalRites wait the book trick used to work?
[0:09:39] <@lewdskeletor13> @1matheuw Try restarting Twitch? That might help
[0:09:41] <starotter70> His gibberish noises when he's yelling
[0:09:50] <$RubberFistFight> @cureneckbeard ah yes, the "effort noises".
[0:09:53] <@lewdskeletor13> @inugamithehound Welcome back! apatDab
[0:09:58] <$RubberFistFight> @starotter70 that's called "angrish", it's a trope.
[0:10:01] <NocturnalRites> @Youwereeatenbyalid it still does in the base unofficial patch
[0:10:01] <%DigitalJoshie> hopefully my work's Wi-Fi isn't too bad tonight
[0:10:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> Playing Grim Dawn and just found a Skull Fetish, which is what Paige has sipsipGasm
[0:10:03] <$cureneckbeard> I also like the satisfied "mmm" noise when he drinks e.g. red bull. mmm.
[0:10:07] <NeonBleu> !uptime
[0:10:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 10m 9s.

[0:10:12] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Neat
[0:10:22] <$cureneckbeard> can we get a montage video of the pat noises
[0:10:22] <%Tucker0603> has he started yet?
[0:10:23] <NeoOneShin> YOu can also stat the game maxed out with a charactr selection exploit
[0:10:23] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> also CONGRATS BOYS AND GIRLS, WE ARE NOW OFFICIALLY ONE MINUTE LATE
[0:10:31] <NocturnalRites> yeah i miss all those delicious free skill points
[0:10:31] <damienlunas> I watched the clip of Pat laughing at Kiryu's "IT'S GROWING" with my dad in the room, he thought it was a DOG.
[0:10:32] <@lewdskeletor13> @tucker0603 Nope not yet
[0:10:42] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Did anyone see that sick MK11 trailer with the OG track?

[0:11:00] <%dukenux> apatSkelmo
[0:11:02] <@lewdskeletor13> I know nothing about MK but these trailers have been selling me on the story
[0:11:03] <starotter70> @damienlunas I mean that's not TOO far off
[0:11:04] <$RubberFistFight> @damienlunas Pat trying and failing to hold in his laughter during the "back of the bus" sequence of Detroit was great. Possibly one of the greatest.
[0:11:04] <%joylent_blue> for woolie noises, see: last 4 episodes of the DMC5 lp
[0:11:06] <+TheWallOfMeat> Pat noises, woolie faces
[0:11:06] <$cureneckbeard> What noises does Woolie make?
[0:11:09] <%El_Desperad0> IT'S GROWING should be a emote

[0:21:22] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat when you guys did your MK9 "let's watch" there were only 4 episodes, 3 around 30 minutes and one at about 50. Even adding in the fights, you can get through them fast if you're not a complete scrub, so 5 hours is about right.

[0:37:26] <+Nymphonomicon> Don't be a fatty, eat a knife instead Pat. They're made of fried veggies.
[0:37:26] <RupanSen> I think he would hate Kreia
[0:37:27] <%sshen> 2 is better than 1 with the patch
[0:37:28] <ShichiNoBushi> Play Jade Empire, though?
[0:37:29] <%spiritofmojave> I think TARIS STAT SCREEN
[0:37:38] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> 40 more episodes of Taris
[0:37:39] <%vivinxs> speakin of kotor, which one is ur favourite?

[0:37:47] <Stofil42> I'd kill for pat to play LISA on stream
[0:37:47] <%AncelDeLambert> maybe NOT play a giant asshole that only fights when you want DIALOGUE OPTIONS
[0:37:49] <%JenovasPuppet> Yeyeye
[0:37:52] <%lmybestfriendl> Pat talk good
[0:37:54] <%ElenaManetta> Did Pat want to be tiny the whole question time or did he forgets-o
[0:37:56] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> KoTOR 2 isn't fantastic as a whole, but Kreia's a great character
[0:37:58] <+Zer0Heartz> DO IT ASAYC
[0:37:58] <%Afterman_> strem TOR as a nautolan
[0:38:03] <+Zilla93> Kreia disapproves
[0:38:15] <@lewdskeletor13> Gotta play Tales from the Borderlands too apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:38:15] <+ren173> Didn't that get delayed due to drugs do
[0:38:16] <%JenovasPuppet> Play it with Paige so she can get incredibly confused by the plot
[0:38:19] <%arancet> @AngriestPat with Octopath on PC, gonna stream that?
[0:38:22] <%Dio_TR> CHEEKI BREEKI

[0:38:36] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> I love pat
[0:38:37] <%0dokuro> I like the talk of the force in that game though
[0:38:38] <%El_Desperad0> It is
[0:38:39] <ThirdPersonPhil> something else will probalby come out by then
[0:38:42] <%SirGO0SE> if we donate money to woolie to go to your house during it would you let him inside and sit next to you during it
[0:38:44] <%Afterman_> why
[0:38:46] <%spiritofmojave> It's more fun playing it yourself yeah
[0:38:46] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Couldn't be worse than Pillars
[0:38:46] <Them00n> Kotor is stream poison as well.
[0:38:47] <%joylent_blue> OH YEAH Octopath is on pc
[0:38:49] <Stofil42> @AngriestPat I seem to remember woolie being inquisitive about you eventually playing LISA: the painful on an old podcast, do you think you'll ever try it?
[0:38:54] <%0dokuro> its a lot more interesting
[0:38:57] <%valriot> Why did you stream Pillars then?
[0:38:58] <%El_Desperad0> @Them00n amen to that
[0:39:01] <%Dio_TR> Fuck Octopath that shit is boring AF
[0:39:05] <therakishsage> VTM: Redemption is a gem.
[0:39:08] <%PlainSimpleTailor> So, Pat's getting the Chinese spyware then? :P
[0:39:08] <%redrins> Is there any way we'd see pillars 2 tho?
[0:39:14] <%Despera__> LISA IS SO GOOD THO
[0:39:17] <%ElenaManetta> You don't know until you try
[0:39:17] <%SirGO0SE> you were wrong :(
[0:39:17] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> and you were a FOOL
[0:39:18] <starotter70> Yeah...
[0:39:18] <%0dokuro> Like Yakuza
[0:39:19] <%topendbuzz> and?
[0:39:19] <%mh9s> pillars streams were GREAT
[0:39:21] <@lewdskeletor13> Pillars doesn’t get viewers
[0:39:21] <%ElenaManetta> Also Octopath's writing sucks
[0:39:22] <+miguelrod777> F
[0:39:23] <SchroedingersFerret> GALLARDE
[0:39:23] <%lizard0tm> I watched Pillars
[0:39:25] <%topendbuzz> did it?
[0:39:25] <%SilverFist91> @AngriestPat if you play Kotor 2, what would be the name of Pocket's secret apprentice?
[0:39:25] <%spiritofmojave> I sure loved those Pillars VODS sugoiSmugsnake
[0:39:26] <%Spydurman> YOU WERE WRONG
[0:39:27] <LtSergei> Pillars 2 is straight up just bad
[0:39:27] <%El_Desperad0> @valriot everyone kept bugging him to do it, he did and no one watched it
[0:39:27] <ミュウレ4242> bloodlines is still better than redemption, tho.
[0:39:28] <%valriot> Its a good game but its POISON
[0:39:28] <%irziggo> pillars was awesome
[0:39:29] <Vroom0> Play the Master Chief Collection Jebaited
[0:39:30] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Stream more pillars btw
[0:39:31] <%ElenaManetta> Everyone hails the game but my goodness it's hard to trudge through some of that dialogue
[0:39:33] <%dabulous_> @dabulous_ is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[0:39:35] <%shotgang86> If Totalbiscuit was still alive he would complain about the lack of a FOV slider for Octopath
[0:39:37] <%Dio_TR> @ElenaManetta Truer words cannot be spoken
[0:39:37] <HopelesSoul7> @AngriestPat i liked the pillars stream FeelsBadMan
[0:39:39] <%Despera__> Make Paige play LISA: The Painful

[1:00:35] <RupanSen> alley behind convenience store
[1:00:35] <therakishsage> It's probably a good idea to defer to the weird creepy blue wizard vampire for advice on sucking Gargoyles. @AngriestPat
[1:00:36] <$jobbedbone> by removing all of their competition
[1:00:38] <DSD24> Maybe you should put your charm up

[1:00:49] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> no better place to be~
[1:00:50] <%Laecerelius> Got plenty of succ elsewhere
[1:00:50] <%SolidusRex> Hollywood is terrible for back alley sucking.
[1:00:51] <rytisone> the most common quest in human lives
[1:00:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Tremere make gargoyles. Maybe ask Strauss about it.
[1:00:53] <Dakuu75> Whata ya buyin, whata ya sellin~
[1:00:55] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Makin our way downtown
[1:00:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat This is guiding the playthrough more than I'd like, but you should talk to Strauss before continuing the Gargoyle quest.
[1:00:58] <ShichiNoBushi> Best scam would be a vampire going to a restaurant, eating the food there, vomiting it up along with some blood, and say, truthfully, that the meal made them sick.
[1:01:02] <%supersugoisenpai1> Gotta go downtown for the good succ
[1:01:02] <Chester_goes_Berserk> This game is hard without dick points
[1:01:03] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> walking faster
[1:01:04] <ancrest_tant> I forget, what the hell is the point of this game (besides the succ)
[1:01:05] <alexandrecau> like there is usually another reason for the record than jerking to it
[1:01:05] <%Laecerelius> And maybe get some cash from big tiddy goth bar owner
[1:01:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> Fun fact: If you play a female, Romero (guy in the graveyard) is the only Male Blood Doll you can charm.
[1:01:06] <@commanderclaw> Pat doesn't pay for succ

[1:13:55] <%ElenaManetta> O K A Y
[1:13:56] <%manwithboxonhead> Fun Fact: In another Vampire the Masquerade game Redemtion you see the ritual to create one. And it involves other vampires being used to create them...
[1:13:59] <ooblag> How do you keep zooming in on the ONE GUY who is super wrong in every situation?
[1:14:00] <count_bob> Pat just didn't get it.
[1:14:00] <%0dokuro> just succ the gargoyle
[1:14:01] <%dukenux> Chat is getting fucky lately.. Is this the REAL power of CRAZY TALK?
[1:14:04] <+PBJammy> rooDevil
[1:14:07] <DracaenaLeaf> plus patch is another patch aside from the unooficial one
[1:14:07] <aimlesshealer> @Gatzarlok "How do I defeat the Gargoyles?" "Very carefully..."
[1:14:09] <%ElenaManetta> WHAT'RE DRiVING
[1:14:10] <%SolidusRex> I get the feeling most of the chat (myself included) usually play this with the Plus Patch.
[1:14:12] <flubber3d> freakazoid chat
[1:14:13] <energywarning> oh great, heather
[1:14:16] <DracaenaLeaf> gotta switch around games
[1:14:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @CappuccinoGuil It's a version of the Unofficial Patch that re-adds content and changes things in other ways. It's just an option during installation.
[1:14:19] <%king_wragles> Pat also likes this game a lot
[1:14:19] <+dirtyh4rr1> It's not plus patch, is persuassion you need
[1:14:21] <%0dokuro> This man is organized
[1:14:22] <BunnyEmperor> Friday is succ time

[1:14:51] <%Ragin_Asian06> before you streamed when was the last time you played this?
[1:14:52] <ScreamingMeat> @manwithboxonhead Gargoyles in this series are kind of a chimeric hybrid of different vampire bloodlines
[1:14:54] <%TeraMercier> I really love seeing every bit of this game that Pat streams. I'll get around to Y6 eventually

[1:27:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes, mention the master who Strauss has stated multiple times he hates.

[1:31:41] <%lizard0tm> What if he needs the blood bags for later

[1:32:15] <count_bob> Drink from the challace.

[1:33:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @dukenux No, the way gargoyles are made is by putting a soul and blood into a stone creation.
[1:33:12] <%mh9s> open a gate into his face NO SPEAK
[1:33:12] <+TheSaintJohn> but...
[1:33:13] <BunnyEmperor> kden

[1:33:16] <%JenovasPuppet> SUCC SUCC SUCC
[1:33:16] <GothicLoveBlood> @Chocolatevgz more points into perception and gary hints it
[1:33:18] <%mercado94> oh videogame
[1:33:19] <+Chocolatevgz> @KeystoneA1 I mean that the quest provides no hints, just that he wants it lol
[1:33:19] <TwinBat> AW YEAH
[1:33:21] <+Plankman> SUCC
[1:33:26] <%Aydarkzero> she's taking it like a champ
[1:33:30] <%deviljhojho94> be nice to your food patrick
[1:33:30] <%castcode> she was pretty chill about that
[1:33:31] <+Chocolatevgz> He had a hint? Maybe I didn't read close enough
[1:33:31] <Badgerconda_> succ that man
[1:33:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> @deviljhojho94 Okay, I missed most of the streams Pat has done on this, and from what I've watched tonight I actually can't tell if he's going Anarch or Camarilla or if he's decided yet.
[1:33:39] <Ion_Laser> tHE SUCC
[1:33:40] <%thelonechris> Bitch.
[1:33:40] <+Lyraniath> That guy knew what you were. He has been waiting there all night for Succ.
[1:33:41] <+Plankman> free blood no murder
[1:33:41] <%BakedPretzels> i loved to suck prostitutes back when i was a vampire
[1:33:42] <LtSergei> isaac duder
[1:33:42] <DracaenaLeaf> right?
[1:33:44] <%manwithboxonhead> Out in the open
[1:33:45] <Jmazitalia> the best kind of succ is when you clip right through the torso
[1:33:48] <a1u5> Isaac
[1:33:48] <%dukenux> AUGER
[1:33:50] <%Laecerelius> You're so dumb to get eaten by a vampire!
[1:33:50] <ShichiNoBushi> Put some into the challice.
[1:33:51] <+Chocolatevgz> Pat's going Succ
[1:33:52] <Atzros> Man, waiting until the last second while feeding is always spooky -- I'm paranoid I'll always end up killing them lmao
[1:33:53] <%Disname23> it's gud
[1:33:53] <Monkeyweed21> isaac
[1:33:54] <rytisone> bleh bleh
[1:33:54] <DracaenaLeaf> it's great
[1:33:54] <%dukenux> this is Deus Ex
[1:33:55] <Vakojin> "Me no speak english sir"
[1:33:55] <Amplificate> How does hispanic blood taste @AngriestPat
[1:33:57] <%deviljhojho94> @CommanderSqueaks He changes his mind depending on who is he talking to
[1:33:57] <tinypouf> YES
[1:33:58] <RupanSen> its the best
[1:33:58] <PowerfulBlackGangs> I love it
[1:33:58] <BigCoffee> @dukenux gargoles were made with blood magic using the shitters from 3 other clans. They have their own clan discipline, stone-like skin and are basically masisve bruisers that can only be taken out by extreme firepower. They were needed in the early days when tremere usurped a place in vampire society and were really weak
[1:33:58] <$Tuskor13> "Woolie look here. ...bitch." *We'll be right back*
[1:33:59] <%Squdnate> @AngriestPat That girl you just suck, is what the speedrunners call Bloodfountain, as she respawns there
[1:33:59] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, it's great
[1:34:00] <LtSergei> pat says this in hollywood
[1:34:00] <KeystoneA1> It's janky goodness
[1:34:01] <%mh9s> cult classic bb
[1:34:02] <LtSergei> just wait
[1:34:02] <%JenovasPuppet> :D
[1:34:02] <%spiritofmojave> This is Deus Ex and I love it
[1:34:03] <+Plankman> i love the guy who sells you weapons in the convienence store
[1:34:03] <%deviljhojho94> yeah its one of my all time favorites
[1:34:03] <Dehlome> its real fucking good
[1:34:05] <+Chocolatevgz> I love this game. I really hope they don't fuck up the sequel lol
[1:34:08] <tinypouf> i love vampire jank a lot
[1:34:08] <%PharosOfLight> Oh pat, I've wiated years to hear you say those words
[1:34:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat said the words.
[1:34:09] <%thelonechris> It has the right level of jank
[1:34:15] <%0dokuro> Its great
[1:34:15] <mrjohncarlton> Its an amazing game held together by gum and scotch tape
[1:34:17] <Croetec> I clapped when he said the thing
[1:34:18] <a1u5> Perfect level of Jank
[1:34:19] <%valkuma> its a shame the developers seem really " ORANGE MAN BAD " about the new one
[1:34:19] <%JenovasPuppet> So glad Pat likes it
[1:34:22] <%pogodick> it's basically Deus Ex with vampires
[1:34:22] <%OldOnyx> doesn't he need to talk to issac very first (and keep his mouth shut)
[1:34:27] <Kazuhira4> I honestly hadn't heard about it till you started playing it!
[1:34:27] <InugamiTheHound> its growing!!!
[1:34:29] <+Plankman> @mrjohncarlton but it's the best tape, and tasty gum
[1:34:30] <%dukenux> @BigCoffee That's cool. the gargoyle clan thing
[1:34:31] <RupanSen> to be fair it wasn't that janky for its time
[1:34:33] <Atzros> It's odd, but I do enjoy the unpolished feel of this game, it gives it some charm
[1:34:33] <%deviljhojho94> its gonna be expecatular, it has most of the original people
[1:34:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @OldOnyx Yes.
[1:34:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> jankpire the masquerade
[1:34:34] <%Aydarkzero> big excite
[1:34:35] <+Chocolatevgz> do we know if Vamp 2 is going to use Requiem rules?
[1:34:37] <Kefkaisnotamused> He said klaatu berata nikto?
[1:34:37] <ooblag> It has Avellone, it will at least have good bits
[1:34:40] <%manwithboxonhead> I have some rulebooks open just for this game right now;
[1:34:40] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Same head writer in 2
[1:34:41] <+walnutcast> @AngriestPat im worried its gonna be like call of cthulhu
[1:34:43] <derap41> nah
[1:34:43] <+barkon345> its probably going to be terible
[1:34:44] <TwinBat> nope
[1:34:44] <Monkeyweed21> yes
[1:34:44] <%dukenux> Eh.
[1:34:45] <+Plankman> it's... okay
[1:34:45] <%TeraMercier> No
[1:34:45] <+LowEnergyStarman> yup
[1:34:45] <%Typhaeon> I don't think so
[1:34:46] <Caidezes> No.
[1:34:46] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Ehhh
[1:34:46] <%deviljhojho94> its ok
[1:34:46] <PowerfulBlackGangs> no
[1:34:46] <%Niney_Who> no
[1:34:46] <+subdude_> Yes
[1:34:46] <%ilasper1> NO ITS TRASH
[1:34:47] <+ArcLifth> eh
[1:34:47] <%Disname23> no
[1:34:48] <KaseKaizer> eh
[1:34:48] <janitor_tulkas> Np
[1:34:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> nope
[1:34:49] <worldbrand> nah
[1:34:49] <%SuperSunny> nah
[1:34:50] <+holybacconknight> yes
[1:34:50] <Them00n> No
[1:34:50] <%spiritofmojave> No, but 1 sure as hell is
[1:34:50] <Meekest> nnnno
[1:34:51] <%mercado94> not really
[1:34:52] <%Bupkis7> YES
[1:34:52] <Vital_Ire> It's fine
[1:34:52] <+theAncopro> the end succccckssss
[1:34:52] <dsauce999> uhhhh
[1:34:52] <%starkandstag> nah
[1:34:52] <LtSergei> nah
[1:34:53] <+hkey_local_machine> noooooooo
[1:34:53] <%BestTeaMaker> yes
[1:34:53] <JamvaanPS4> I liked it
[1:34:54] <%Edgy_Macaroon> Nope
[1:34:54] <TwinBat> HR is better
[1:34:54] <BunnyEmperor> Its not like Human Revolutions
[1:34:54] <+walnutcast> YES JUST PLAY IT
[1:34:56] <ScreamingMeat> Yeah it's fine
[1:34:56] <%PalmtopNami> yes but it's super short.
[1:34:56] <energywarning> only if you absolutely have to scratch that itch
[1:34:56] <Caidezes> There's literally no ending.
[1:34:57] <Vital_Ire> It's not bad
[1:34:57] <chikensandwich> it good
[1:34:58] <+LowEnergyStarman> it goes places
[1:34:58] <SpaceGuntank> its okay, its not the best version
[1:34:59] <rickhaos> its ok
[1:35:00] <Manooz> human revolution is fucking sexy tho
[1:35:00] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat For the gameplay: Yes. For the story: no
[1:35:00] <byobuer> nah
[1:35:03] <PowerfulBlackGangs> It's like a first act stretched into a game
[1:35:03] <T_Sasquatch> temper your expectations
[1:35:03] <janitor_tulkas> that game sucks
[1:35:04] <starotter70> @AngriestPat You'll have two character creators: one for becoming thin blood and then one for full time vampire
[1:35:04] <hottcoco> nope\
[1:35:06] <BunnyEmperor> Its fine but not the same
[1:35:06] <%Laecerelius> Are they ever going to put out the second half to that game?
[1:35:06] <HopelesSoul7> @AngriestPat human revolution is a 9 makind is a 6
[1:35:06] <%CJett92> it's like 6/10
[1:35:07] <%starkandstag> both of the major reveals were cut from the game
[1:35:07] <%TeraMercier> It's fine but whatever man, it's like just playing Human Revolution bu shinier
[1:35:07] <%BestTeaMaker> mnkind divided is gret
[1:35:08] <%deviljhojho94> abrahams first
[1:35:09] <Badgerconda_> I didn't really like it much.
[1:35:09] <%Disname23> it ends with a massive sequel bait that will never be made
[1:35:09] <%Tearonex> The game itself is fine
[1:35:10] <alcors_wisdom> i mean i liked it but they leave alot of lose ends still fun though
[1:35:11] <%mh9s> gotta talk to Issac first man
[1:35:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> that game is the dictionary definition of ok.
[1:35:13] <flubber3d> maybe for an hour
[1:35:14] <%PalmtopNami> it ends to early. but it's a fantastic game.
[1:35:15] <ValidVenasaur> it ends in a cliffhanger
[1:35:15] <+walnutcast> LUL
[1:35:15] <%manwithboxonhead> What
[1:35:15] <%deviljhojho94> gotta talk to brams first
[1:35:15] <count_bob> Abrams first.
[1:35:16] <@commanderclaw> Tell Isaac
[1:35:17] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> wait what?
[1:35:17] <Ion_Laser> LUL
[1:35:18] <Blank9> the dlc is great in it
[1:35:19] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Mankind Divided is great gameplay and crap story yeah
[1:35:20] <ooblag> You need to talk to Isaac first, I GUESS
[1:35:20] <dsauce999> N E O N A T E
[1:35:20] <a1u5> Isaac first
[1:35:20] <alcors_wisdom> and you could do alot of goofy stuff in it
[1:35:20] <PhantaniumOG> Have to turn it in at Isaac
[1:35:21] <+subdude_> It's just like Human Revolution. Don't know why people don't like it.
[1:35:21] <+Chocolatevgz> Hellooo neeonaate I have barely any dialogue for the rest of the gaaaame
[1:35:22] <%Appleauce101> kinda but the story ends on a clifhanger that they wont complete cause sales for like 4 years
[1:35:22] <JamvaanPS4> I liked it but yeah the game doesn't have an actual ending and if Squares not going back to it then don't bother
[1:35:25] <hntronium> Eh
[1:35:32] <%JenovasPuppet> "This game is amazing!"
[1:35:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat But are you gonna snitch?
[1:35:34] <a1u5> Check Mercurio too
[1:35:34] <BunnyEmperor> Boss fights in HR are better too imo
[1:35:36] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> and do the creepy suck
[1:35:37] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> It has decent gameplay, but the story has a lot of loose ends
[1:35:44] <%manwithboxonhead> Everyday life : Kindred Edition
[1:35:45] <%gespenst25> I was afraid of that you need to talk to Isaac first
[1:35:46] <%TeraMercier> From what I heard they cut the last half of Mankind Divided to make a third game and that's why the ending blows
[1:35:47] <gustavozxd> pat's not gonna snitch
[1:35:47] <dsauce999> FARM EXP
[1:35:48] <starotter70> That knife will ALWAYS be there
[1:35:53] <InugamiTheHound> I have both human revolution and mankind divided. never played either of them
[1:35:55] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat Mankind Divided is not as good as Human Revolution story-wise but it does play better and is worth going back too
[1:36:00] <Caidezes> Immersive sims.
[1:36:03] <%JenovasPuppet> But for real though, this game IS great, despite its massive MASSIVE jank
[1:36:07] <Them00n> Pat puts his clan above his sect.
[1:36:07] <mankeyfight> uptime
[1:36:08] <Conky89> Mankind Divided was a wonderful expansion pack.
[1:36:08] <Daxalog> How about the original Deus Ex?
[1:36:09] <InugamiTheHound> The darkness 1 is like this
[1:36:10] <BunnyEmperor> Play the original Deus Ex LUL
[1:36:12] <%HRDSalami654> It's good, but the ending is a let down.
[1:36:15] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> They are fun
[1:36:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> mankind divided is a good game, but it would be bad for streaming.
[1:36:18] <%spiritofmojave> Yakuza but with ACTUAL killing Kappa
[1:36:18] <LtSergei> Pat play Deux Ex: the original good one
[1:36:18] <rytisone> play Postal 2
[1:36:19] <byobuer> omikron Kappa
[1:36:20] <%HRDSalami654> In terms of gameplay it's great.
[1:36:20] <KaseKaizer> ???
[1:36:21] <ShichiNoBushi> The Sims?
[1:36:22] <Bouldus> ?
[1:36:22] <%mh9s> HUH'
[1:36:23] <%ElenaManetta> You like small, detailed maps?
[1:36:23] <%Disname23> nice
[1:36:23] <KeystoneA1> ok?
[1:36:23] <GothicLoveBlood> Atmospheric
[1:36:23] <BunnyEmperor> Stick with the prod , prod with the prod
[1:36:24] <%salty_syd913> ?
[1:36:25] <%dukenux> ??
[1:36:26] <starotter70> wha
[1:36:26] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat The only bad part about the plot is the very very end cause it sets up a sequel. People blow it out of proportion. The gameplay is fantastic
[1:36:26] <DSD24> Prey 2016 was so good
[1:36:26] <SpaceGuntank> gameplay is 8/10 but story is 4.5/10
[1:36:27] <%Piemen99> ????]
[1:36:27] <Vital_Ire> are we talking about mankind divided or human revolution?
[1:36:28] <starotter70> Tja
[1:36:28] <SeventyForce> Cool story, pat
[1:36:29] <NumbusPlays> what
[1:36:29] <aimlesshealer> ???
[1:36:30] <%manwithboxonhead> Necromorphs!!!
[1:36:30] <+TheSaintJohn> uh
[1:36:31] <Ion_Laser> ???
[1:36:32] <ObsidianDragon86> You think your floor just took a shit?
[1:36:33] <worldbrand> What does that mean?
[1:36:33] <+Chewygamer> me too pat me too
[1:36:33] <Bouldus> wtf Pat
[1:36:33] <rubbishbinge> u shud try dragon dogma
[1:36:34] <%TeraMercier> @AngriestPat It's actually pretty disappointing for that cause you just get a bunch of junk that doesn't amount to much gameplay other than selling items, which doesn't let you buy very interesting stuff
[1:36:35] <gustavozxd> what's the happs bro
[1:36:35] <$jobbedbone> Basement Moles
[1:36:35] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Play Invisible War Kappa
[1:36:37] <%Unlimited_> huh?
[1:36:37] <funkieboy> so games like omikron
[1:36:38] <%dukenux> Small detailed maps > GIANT empty sandboxes
[1:36:39] <TalisKanju> That water table catching up to you
[1:36:42] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> ?
[1:36:43] <RupanSen> Immersive Sims are more like System Shock and Prey
[1:36:47] <%HRDSalami654> Human Revolution is better in almost every way though.
[1:36:47] <+theAncopro> Making divided's hub is pretty good to its credit
[1:36:50] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Elmo pee
[1:36:52] <Psyramics> its your sump pump
[1:36:53] <ShichiNoBushi> That's rain in the game.

[1:38:23] <InugamiTheHound> i never delete my mail in warframe
[1:38:24] <Conky89> I was surprised that Mankind Divided only took place in one city and was only 20 hours long. Plus the story...oh the story!
[1:38:25] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Deleting emails is for cowards
[1:38:25] <dsauce999> LUL
[1:38:26] <mankeyfight> mailbox
[1:38:28] <$Slimshazbot> ???
[1:38:29] <%PalmtopNami> the story is pretty good for the most part. but the game ends to early.
[1:38:32] <+Plankman> @TalisKanju hooked on pat's ginger blood
[1:38:33] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Please get defensive stats, you'll need them
[1:38:33] <DracaenaLeaf> delete email because you can't see new ones iirc. but I could be wrong
[1:38:34] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> He's right
[1:38:34] <%ElenaManetta> Play FABLE
[1:38:37] <%JenovasPuppet> The email system sucks and you need to delete some to make it easy to use.
[1:38:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, remember to go to Vesuvius to get more quests and more XP for more blood magic shenanigans
[1:38:39] <krymzen5> agreed
[1:38:39] <Caidezes> Yeah, but it's still better than Mankind Divided.
[1:38:40] <HeadsHeldHigh> Pray play prey prey
[1:38:40] <%Laecerelius> Fair enough
[1:38:40] <a1u5> Do you man systems shock?
[1:38:41] <%Kduff89> prey is indeed a biosock
[1:38:42] <RupanSen> that's what immersive sims are Pat
[1:38:42] <%MonsieurHedge> prey is a damn good bioshock is what it is
[1:38:43] <%PaladinDupre> what about S.T.A.L.K.E.R.?
[1:38:44] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @ElenaManetta that's weak bait
[1:38:44] <%dukenux> Prey seemed like straight up shooter, stealth game
[1:38:45] <krymzen5> or a system shock
[1:38:45] <%valkuma> Sullying prey by calling it bioshock DansGame
[1:38:45] <Wan6Saber> @Valentinius_Anodyne and criminals!
[1:38:46] <Badgerconda_> I played mankind divided and it just seemed.... weird. I didn't really like it much.
[1:38:48] <ScreamingMeat> To avoid getting put in prison so you can still run for president
[1:38:49] <GreatestGuess> Play original deus ex
[1:38:49] <$jobbedbone> "why would I delete my emails now that I have a big fancy video card"
[1:38:50] <+MoonlightP> prey is an immersive sim, it's literally the genre
[1:38:51] <dsauce999> HUNNID DOLLHAIRS
[1:38:51] <%TeraMercier> Prey is good but has weird structure problems cause of the gloo gun and shit
[1:38:52] <DSD24> Prey was so good
[1:38:54] <%ElenaManetta> apatSmug
[1:38:54] <Daxalog> A system shock 3
[1:38:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> @deviljhojho94 Pat talks about how much community support this game gets, Ian Watson, the community manager for Onyx Path (the group that publishes the tabletop game) created and continues to maintain one of the more popular Vampire The Masquerade fan mods.
[1:38:55] <%Laecerelius> Oh man, a Stalker playthrough would be fun!
[1:39:02] <%PharosOfLight> are you even blocking, though?
[1:39:02] <+Chocolatevgz> Enter Money in the console, it adds a multiplier to boobs it's really funny
[1:39:03] <+sourceofall> prey is basically bioshock in space
[1:39:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> Prey and System Shock ARE Immersive Sims
[1:39:03] <gustavozxd> @jobbedbone yeah i got lost there too lol
[1:39:04] <Kefkaisnotamused> Prey was amazing.
[1:39:05] <%mh9s> stamina and dodge
[1:39:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Stamina
[1:39:06] <finalgrinder> stamina
[1:39:07] <@commanderclaw> Stamina is a good one
[1:39:07] <$nademonkey1100> S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of Prypat
[1:39:08] <starotter70> Nah, glass cannon
[1:39:10] <nawadap136> @angriestpat your e-mail can only hold up to 10 messages. not deleting them makes you most out on new sidequests.
[1:39:11] <%gespenst25> $100 thanks billionaire
[1:39:11] <TalisKanju> I didn't know Bioshock was a genre
[1:39:11] <Madbearv> Pat's rocking a middle age vampire xp
[1:39:13] <%PharosOfLight> Remember, tab to block
[1:39:15] <%Laecerelius> Dodge?
[1:39:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Stamina increases your bashing soak.
[1:39:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> Melee
[1:39:19] <%manwithboxonhead> Dodge or Dexteriety
[1:39:19] <RupanSen> Prey >>>>>>>>>>>>> Bioshock btw
[1:39:23] <@lewdskeletor13> Man Prey was so good
[1:39:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> sholarship
[1:39:25] <+RushUnplugged> stamina, dodge, and getting more armor
[1:39:26] <a1u5> Stamina increases HP

[1:39:28] <%dukenux> Thief is another great series
[1:39:29] <Monkeyweed21> no save for dominate
[1:39:30] <krymzen5> never got stalker to run well on any of my pcs sadly
[1:39:30] <%wvuboii> GUN UP
[1:39:33] <gustavozxd> @RupanSen which prey tho
[1:39:35] <Jack_Nightshadow> Bashing is covered by stamina, everything else is clothing.
[1:39:40] <RupanSen> 2017
[1:39:40] <Kefkaisnotamused> Dex is best stat of all time.
[1:39:40] <KeystoneA1> wowowowowowo

[1:39:43] <HopelesSoul7> @AngriestPat you pick a wierd clan if you were going for a melee build

[1:39:51] <@lewdskeletor13> wowowowowow
[1:39:51] <InugamiTheHound> IMO bioshock franchise is most overrated shit franchise out there. The only good bioshock game is 2nd one
[1:39:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> waowaowaowaow
[1:39:53] <kek_meisterr> fuck i love the soundtrack in this game
[1:39:55] <%deviljhojho94> @CommanderSqueaks Can't say I've fiddles too much with mods beyonde the basically necesary UP, but final nights was pretty good IMO, and clan quest had its moments
[1:39:57] <Monkeyweed21> Save for dominate
[1:39:58] <dsauce999> No more waowao
[1:39:59] <Huntercd> I wish I could play this
[1:40:03] <%TeraMercier> @AngriestPat Just confirmed it your max emails is 10 and you'll miss sidequests
[1:40:03] <Madbearv> u do
[1:40:03] <%dukenux> I agree, Bioshock is eh. (And 2 is the best game)
[1:40:04] <ミュウレ4242> akibastrip has a runaround a city thing going, but it iss anime to the max.
[1:40:07] <Croetec> better have firearms
[1:40:08] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> 2017 Prey is a great game
[1:40:09] <Monkeyweed21> you're fine
[1:40:10] <Them00n> @AngriestPat Big SHOOT
[1:40:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @TeraMercier You can hit next.
[1:40:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ignore people, people are dumb.
[1:40:17] <Wan6Saber> @dukenux agreed
[1:40:19] <%deviljhojho94> gangrel in the UP fuck shit up, but they are actual shit in the unmodded game
[1:40:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Glass cannon.
[1:40:22] <DSD24> Bioshock Infinite was the worst one
[1:40:22] <+TheSaintJohn> Punch Wizard! Magic FISTS
[1:40:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can hit next to see more than 10 emails.
[1:40:24] <%AncelDeLambert> Bioshock 2 has the writing of a concussed gerbil
[1:40:25] <InugamiTheHound> @dukenux thank you! Someone finally agrees with me
[1:40:26] <Jack_Nightshadow> Defense is a good thing to have, irregardless of build.
[1:40:26] <Frost_Quill> No, Mercurio!
[1:40:27] <DracaenaLeaf> right?
[1:40:27] <%deviljhojho94> Nosferatu fuck shit up always
[1:40:28] <TwinBat> *Pat remembered that
[1:40:28] <+Mondeiya> i can't believe people are saying the 2nd game is the best
[1:40:29] <%TeraMercier> Shit, guess I gotta do less lazy research im dumb
[1:40:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> In fact in the base game, before the fan patch, deleting emails could crash the game.
[1:40:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> I love how we're all into the waowaowaowao
[1:40:35] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> But Pat, where should we sent emails?
[1:40:35] <ameraaaaaa> Hollywood the city of broken dreams
[1:40:38] <$Slimshazbot> Why is everyone in this chat obsessed with guns? There's only one fight in this game that gave me trouble with melee, and I still only died once on it
[1:40:38] <%manwithboxonhead> I want to make Waowaowaow my Ringtone
[1:40:43] <GothicLoveBlood> @TeraMercier wrong you can have more just press n for next page
[1:40:45] <%spiritofmojave> An age before Gmail's seemingly life-time storage
[1:40:45] <%JenovasPuppet> 10 VISIBLE you still get them even if you're full
[1:40:45] <$jobbedbone> tell paige we need more fanfics to sleep to
[1:40:49] <krymzen5> bioshock 1 was the only game in the series i really liked
[1:40:50] <+Horny_culprit> how did they nail the mise en scene in this shit so hard
[1:40:54] <ooblag> You need defense, and some melee. More important though, you GUN, because GUN will do the bulk of your endgame boss damage
[1:40:55] <Kefkaisnotamused> The merc with the curio.
[1:40:57] <dsauce999> HURRY MORE WAOWAOWAO
[1:40:58] <DSD24> Bioshock 2 is just as good as 1
[1:40:59] <byobuer> venture tower?
[1:41:01] <%deviljhojho94> @Slimshazbot Pat's clan has some nifty bonuses to ranged combat
[1:41:11] <%Disname23> cammy fuck
[1:41:12] <starotter70> Never delete emails 10 mins later: always delete emails
[1:41:16] <TalisKanju> Bioshock's story was good until the climax
[1:41:25] <%deviljhojho94> NO
[1:41:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> Never snitch on your homey
[1:41:27] <Kefkaisnotamused> I... kinda.. really like this dude.

[1:41:41] <%spiritofmojave> Sellout your race, it ain't hard!
[1:41:42] <%deviljhojho94> what the fuck man
[1:41:42] <%dukenux> I honestly think BS2 is better than 1. Had much more fun gameplay wise. And story pulled emotional strings better.
[1:41:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> N-nothing. B-baka!
[1:41:46] <%manwithboxonhead> I LEARNED BIG Secret : Nothing
[1:41:46] <rytisone> NOT suspicious

[1:41:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> Nothing b-baka
[1:41:52] <a1u5> Ignore the fact that gargoyles are all made by Tremere...
[1:41:54] <InugamiTheHound> Bioshock 3's story was so bad and I hate it. Bioshock wasn't very good even with plot twist it didn't help it
[1:41:54] <krymzen5> nom
[1:41:55] <@lewdskeletor13> BACKDOWN
[1:41:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> @deviljhojho94 Also, Hardsuit Labs, the company that's developing Bloodlines 2, actually made a build and approached Paradox when they found out Paradox was interested in a sequel. So they're true believers, too.
[1:41:55] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Bye Paige!
[1:41:57] <Vital_Ire> can you send multiple people to your apartment?

[1:42:36] <hntronium> Flamethrower!
[1:42:37] <%shotgang86> better shotgun
[1:42:37] <RupanSen> Steyr Aus is gud
[1:42:40] <%deviljhojho94> @CommanderSqueaks God damn I have so much faith in that game. I've been waiting for 15 years so i hope to god it is good
[1:42:40] <%Laecerelius> A FUCKING FLAMER, PAT!
[1:42:41] <rytisone> waowaowaowao
[1:42:41] <@lewdskeletor13> @snow_bush Night
[1:42:42] <Jack_Nightshadow> Mercurio can get you a Flamethrower, thougj.
[1:42:43] <RupanSen> *Aug
[1:42:43] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Can he actually get you a nuke
[1:42:44] <%Laecerelius> It's rad!
[1:42:44] <mankeyfight> Raise seduction to at least 2 to unlock different dialogue options
[1:42:45] <starotter70> How do you know!?
[1:42:45] <overlordkog> The flamethrower he sells is stupid overpowered.
[1:42:45] <BigCoffee> Ah just wait for later then for the flamer
[1:42:45] <ZZCooldown> @AngriestPat have you played the shadowrun games?
[1:42:47] <%manwithboxonhead> Dominate is not worth it I think.
[1:42:48] <LtSergei> pat already has jaime sue
[1:42:48] <Chester_goes_Berserk> He'll probably update when you hit Chinatown
[1:42:50] <byobuer> did paige ever get a beret?
[1:42:52] <benhart18> Nukes are weak against vampires
[1:42:53] <BunnyEmperor> Dominate, Mass Suicide
[1:42:53] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat Dump only one into Seduction so you can Succ the Blood Dolls in the clubs (the ladies you talk to)
[1:42:54] <InugamiTheHound> AUG is great gun in real life
[1:42:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Mercurio gets the SWAT rifle when you finish Hollywood.
[1:42:55] <Kefkaisnotamused> DOminate 5 is so cheap.
[1:42:55] <Monkeyweed21> BDSM Build
[1:42:55] <Huntercd> I hope the sequel lets me create a harem
[1:42:57] <%trnzero> trnzero subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[1:42:57] <ooblag> Put points in Dex
[1:42:59] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I hear camps are weak to the Tactical Nuke
[1:42:59] <$Slimshazbot> Hardsuit Labs also made Blacklight Retribution, which while it was a WILDLY different game than this, and the F2P stuff got real scummy late in it's life, what a good ass shooter
[1:42:59] <DracaenaLeaf> Yeah
[1:43:00] <Madbearv> no
[1:43:01] <dsauce999> NO! Need more wao
[1:43:01] <Wan6Saber> @benhart18 nope
[1:43:02] <TalisKanju> Yes, got. Everything after meeting Andrew Ryan was the dumbest
[1:43:03] <a1u5> Yes, and it's super handy
[1:43:03] <%manwithboxonhead> NO
[1:43:03] <strangelee> yea
[1:43:04] <+Plankman> Yes, but carefully
[1:43:04] <NeroInfinite> yess
[1:43:04] <%dukenux> COO
[1:43:05] <%Disname23> just don't burn yourself
[1:43:06] <overlordkog> Yep
[1:43:06] <Madbearv> you should frenzy
[1:43:07] <%deviljhojho94> Yes tomatoDevious
[1:43:07] <%Laecerelius> Just don't run into the fire
[1:43:08] <BigCoffee> yeah,c arefully
[1:43:08] <Madbearv> er
[1:43:11] <NeoOneShin> Only if they overcome the frenzy check
[1:43:12] <ScreamingMeat> @a1u5 Actually *adjust nerd glasses* Gargoyles, being vampires, can and have turned mortals into gargoyle vampires
[1:43:12] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> will paige play them?
[1:43:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> are they?
[1:43:14] <KaseKaizer> Flowthrower is GOAT
[1:43:15] <tinypouf> yaas shadowrun
[1:43:15] <Madbearv> you would frenzy just by being near it
[1:43:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> They would have to be very brave
[1:43:18] <ObsidianDragon86> I still say Dragonfall is best
[1:43:18] <$nademonkey1100> point the loud end at the enemy and you should be fine
[1:43:18] <Croetec> It burns through ammo though Kappa
[1:43:20] <+Plankman> i mean, to be fair, everybody has to be careful with a flamethrower
[1:43:23] <Jack_Nightshadow> yes, you can use a flamethrower. Just don't bathe in it.,
[1:43:24] <DracaenaLeaf> flamethrower is pretty powerful but ammo is tricky
[1:43:26] <%spiritofmojave> Vampire's using a flamethrower in any area with a slight breeze seems like a hazard
[1:43:30] <%dukenux> Paige wanted to play SR on stream. if she does, hope you join her.
[1:43:31] <a1u5> After Mass effect
[1:43:32] <@lewdskeletor13> Paige was playing them recently I think
[1:43:32] <RupanSen> Dragonfall is one of the best cRPGs in the last years
[1:43:33] <ScreamingMeat> It's like using bug spay
[1:43:36] <Monkeyweed21> Paige MUST steam Catherine
[1:43:37] <ooblag> Why is the music fucked?
[1:43:37] <$Slimshazbot> @AngriestPat Did you like Dragonfall or Hong Kong more? I think mechanically HK is better, but I didn't love it quite like DF
[1:43:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> The bravest vampire, and they would still be screaming while using it
[1:43:40] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Paige as a huge Troll would fit
[1:43:43] <%TeraMercier> They seem nice and relatively newbie friendly, at least for someone like myself
[1:43:43] <pectusumbra> oh! Actual question pat, what's the order on the shadowrun games then? Should I play them all or are the expansions and such just buetter?
[1:43:46] <%rasterman> I mean, I can use a flamethrower and I'm pretty sure I'm weak to fire
[1:43:46] <%dukenux> WOT? Paige streamed Shadowrun already?
[1:43:49] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Ahaha I showed up to the stream and she played FF9 instead
[1:43:51] <ooblag> It's worbly
[1:43:52] <%Ragnarok_Flames> vampires literally cannot use a flamethrower without going into fear frenzy
[1:43:53] <%OldOnyx> Paige will want to play with the plus patch for sure. Reason is coming up
[1:43:57] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> ooof
[1:44:01] <%dukenux> Dragonfall is the best
[1:44:01] <strangelee> Why not?
[1:44:02] <worldbrand> Dragonfall is pretty solid
[1:44:04] <%deviljhojho94> dragonfall for story and characters, hong kong for builds
[1:44:05] <@lewdskeletor13> She didn’t stream it but on Twitter I think she said she was playing it
[1:44:06] <ObsidianDragon86> Dragonfall has the more engaging Story
[1:44:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ???
[1:44:09] <NeoOneShin> Most vampires would notbe able to stand nextto a flame, thus they would enter Rotschrek if they operate flamethrowers. Stop being wrong, chat.
[1:44:09] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Uhhhhhh
[1:44:10] <%TheBigO75> Hong Kong is pretty boring
[1:44:11] <dsauce999> N E O N A T E
[1:44:11] <%manwithboxonhead> What
[1:44:12] <Kefkaisnotamused> The eff
[1:44:13] <@commanderclaw> What
[1:44:14] <KaseKaizer> CHAT?!
[1:44:14] <%deviljhojho94> what
[1:44:16] <ObsidianDragon86> Hong Kong kind of Drags on after the halfway mark
[1:44:16] <a1u5> ???
[1:44:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> WAT
[1:44:17] <count_bob> ...Did the quest break?
[1:44:17] <%OldOnyx> wat
[1:44:18] <%shotgang86> wtf
[1:44:18] <StromkoPenguin> I found Hong Kong's hacking system to be really frustrating, I don't play a turn-based RPG so I can dodge ICE in real time
[1:44:19] <starotter70> Broke?
[1:44:19] <%mh9s> uh oh might be broken
[1:44:20] <$Slimshazbot> :0
[1:44:20] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Huh
[1:44:20] <%deviljhojho94> oh no
[1:44:20] <Huntercd> Look at this Morpheus looking mother fucker
[1:44:21] <%dukenux> ???
[1:44:21] <Croetec> SHOULDA SNITCHED
[1:44:21] <KeystoneA1> bugged?
[1:44:22] <Zooperton> broken??
[1:44:23] <%dukenux> Oh no
[1:44:23] <+Plankman> pat stands still at
[1:44:23] <@commanderclaw> I don't understand
[1:44:23] <PowerfulBlackGangs> I blame Pat
[1:44:24] <%spiritofmojave> hello?
[1:44:24] <SpaceGuntank> bug?
[1:44:24] <Jack_Nightshadow> gotta go through the gargoyle dialogue again.
[1:44:25] <+Grayhammatter> uh....
[1:44:25] <BunnyEmperor> Fuckin nuthin
[1:44:25] <a1u5> Uh Oh
[1:44:26] <Monkeyweed21> check log
[1:44:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Did you be too mean to him?
[1:44:28] <+PenmanLupine> Check your quest? I dunno
[1:44:28] <Kefkaisnotamused> Paaaaaat, what did you do this time?
[1:44:28] <kirijotakeharu> He only gives you a reward in the plus patch
[1:44:29] <tinypouf> smurf dad why
[1:44:29] <%deviljhojho94> this cant be happening
[1:44:30] <%TheBigO75> !QUEST AT RISK!
[1:44:31] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Try other dialogue trees
[1:44:31] <@lewdskeletor13> apatWhat
[1:44:33] <dsauce999> LUL
[1:44:33] <%Unlimited_> how could this be\
[1:44:34] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> I can't do anything with this
[1:44:34] <LtSergei> is it because he upset strauss at the beginning?
[1:44:34] <%dukenux> is Borken
[1:44:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> Quest log?
[1:44:36] <worldbrand> hahahaha
[1:44:36] <a1u5> Try other options
[1:44:37] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat i don't know how far you got into mankind divided, but the best part about mankind divided is that Prague practically becomes different levels each time you come back, alongside having an improved mission structure over HR. That said, this is also why I've bugged you about going back to DOS2 if you like the sense of worldbuilding and conversational interactions.
[1:44:37] <$Slimshazbot> keep trying other trees
[1:44:37] <%gespenst25> that's weird
[1:44:38] <%OldOnyx> looks broken
[1:44:39] <finalgrinder> try things
[1:44:41] <%PlasmaPhoenix12> PlasmaPhoenix12 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[1:44:41] <BunnyEmperor> Check journal
[1:44:42] <%deviljhojho94> oh nonono not like this
[1:44:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @kirijotakeharu He's supposed to give the key to the Tremere haven.
[1:44:43] <ooblag> The BGM is also borked. Listen to it.
[1:44:44] <LtSergei> no pat, that's wrong
[1:44:44] <DracaenaLeaf> heh
[1:44:45] <KaseKaizer> 3
[1:44:46] <count_bob> No he doesn't.
[1:44:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> what???
[1:44:46] <PhantaniumOG> No
[1:44:47] <finalgrinder> WRONG
[1:44:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> THAT'S WRONG!
[1:44:47] <$Slimshazbot> @AngriestPat Not true
[1:44:47] <worldbrand> WHAT
[1:44:48] <TwinBat> that's not true
[1:44:48] <%OldOnyx> that's bullshit
[1:44:48] <a1u5> No, super wrong
[1:44:48] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> "The chains of prophecy have been broken"
[1:44:49] <starotter70> 3
[1:44:49] <%manwithboxonhead> I think you talk to him and all he does i say DO NOT TELL ANYONE
[1:44:49] <%deviljhojho94> No he doesnt
[1:44:49] <ZZCooldown> false
[1:44:50] <%mh9s> thats not true, he gives you the haven in the base game
[1:44:51] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Lies
[1:44:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> @deviljhojho94 What I'm hoping for is that if Bloodlines 2 is popular, it may spark enough interest for games of the other series. Honestly, besides VtM, I prefer The Chronicles of Darkness editions for the other Splats (Werewolf: The Forsaken > Werewolf: The Apocalypse & Changeling: The Lost > Changeling: The Dreaming.)
[1:44:52] <Zooperton> I dunno about that
[1:44:52] <DracaenaLeaf> PRess L
[1:44:53] <BigCoffee> no false
[1:44:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> Wrong
[1:44:53] <%Kavtech> That's wrong.
[1:44:54] <+dirtyh4rr1> No
[1:44:54] <%gespenst25> that's not normally how this goes?
[1:44:54] <juxtest> Diablerize him!
[1:44:55] <overlordkog> Wrong
[1:44:55] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> ignore me
[1:44:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> apatWrong
[1:44:57] <BigCoffee> go back
[1:44:57] <%OldOnyx> this is a default thing
[1:44:58] <worldbrand> That would make no sense
[1:44:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> 3
[1:44:59] <RupanSen> I honestly don't remember
[1:45:00] <%Kavtech> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[1:45:02] <%TheBigO75> Crazy talk
[1:45:06] <@lewdskeletor13> apatBig 3
[1:45:07] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Talk to him more to be sure
[1:45:10] <%shotgang86> In think you have to talk to him before you talk to Isaac
[1:45:12] <%TheBigO75> apatWrong
[1:45:12] <GothicLoveBlood> No you get it in the basic patch as well
[1:45:13] <+dirtyh4rr1> You needed persuasion
[1:45:15] <a1u5> Check all dialogue
[1:45:16] <Kefkaisnotamused> Chat is fucking stupid, you get it in vanilla
[1:45:16] <@commanderclaw> No, that's what the wiki says, only the plus patch
[1:45:17] <DracaenaLeaf> There is no quest it looks like?
[1:45:18] <LtSergei> I think because you said "we'll see" when he asked you to keep it a secret
[1:45:18] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @shotgang86 we tried that
[1:45:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He's supposed to give the key to the Tremere haven if you've been nice to him.
[1:45:22] <%OldOnyx> something is busted if he can't even take the quest turn in
[1:45:23] <$RubberFistFight> i was tinkering with my 3D printer and i came back and Pat is frustrated about something. What'd I miss?
[1:45:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat talk to strous before isack
[1:45:23] <ミュウレ4242> there are things like that in the plus patch.
[1:45:26] <Monkeyweed21> talk again]
[1:45:28] <%spiritofmojave> Chat apatFist
[1:45:29] <%deviljhojho94> @CommanderSqueaks I wish to live in a world where I can fuck shit up as a red talon or a red cap, yeah

[1:45:58] <@lewdskeletor13> Apparently it is only plus patch
[1:45:59] <Frost_Quill> Try ALL the Gargoyle options?
[1:45:59] <mankeyfight> Check other dialogue trees
[1:46:00] <+dirtyh4rr1> it's not plus patch
[1:46:01] <LtSergei> No, it's not
[1:46:01] <finalgrinder> no
[1:46:02] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> It is the plus patch
[1:46:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> " If the fledgling is a Tremere, and has completed the quest A Plague for the Angels, Strauss will offer the Tremere Chantry as a new haven, and give the fledgling a proper induction into the clan as an apprentice. "
[1:46:02] <count_bob> No it's not.
[1:46:03] <Frost_Quill> No it's not.
[1:46:04] <kirijotakeharu> Did you talk to Strauss before you talked to Damsel after you killed the plague bearers?
[1:46:04] <GothicLoveBlood> No
[1:46:05] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> I Just checked
[1:46:05] <%Kavtech> It's not.
[1:46:06] <%TheBigO75> The fcuk
[1:46:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> NO
[1:46:07] <%deviljhojho94> This cant be real

[1:46:09] <%mh9s> no it is not
[1:46:09] <+timblenaut> 3
[1:46:09] <antonius40k> this is why you don't play any other version of this game except the + patch laugh my ass off
[1:46:10] <BigCoffee> No I got it without the plus patch
[1:46:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's not Pat.
[1:46:10] <$Slimshazbot> @AngriestPat It's not the + patch, I just did this a few days ago without it
[1:46:11] <PhantaniumOG> It is not chat
[1:46:13] <%dukenux> NotLikeThis
[1:46:13] <ZZCooldown> @AngriestPat remember when you talked to him at first, you needed to tell him that you will keep the secret but you choose that you would think about it
[1:46:13] <Conky89> What the what the what?
[1:46:13] <%Kavtech> That's fucking wrong though.
[1:46:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> IT'S NOT PLUS PATCH.
[1:46:15] <Jack_Nightshadow> alright, its something else then.
[1:46:16] <LtSergei> you upset him
[1:46:17] <gustavozxd> bug
[1:46:18] <%deviljhojho94> I want to die
[1:46:19] <KingOfTheGeats> NotLikeThis
[1:46:19] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Youwereeatenbyalid) (warning)
[1:46:19] <%Disname23> He should give you the key to the tremere haven here even without the plus patch
[1:46:21] <@commanderclaw> Chat is wrong
[1:46:21] <%AncelDeLambert> time to stop telling Pat what to do until you've familiarized yourself with the patch differences
[1:46:21] <%shotgang86> man this game NEEDS a remale
[1:46:21] <%Keyd00d> what's going on
[1:46:23] <%spiritofmojave> hoo boy
[1:46:23] <Chester_goes_Berserk> You can def get the haven, but this is weird
[1:46:23] <@commanderclaw> 3
[1:46:24] <@lewdskeletor13> I’m so confused now
[1:46:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> Plus Patch adds an EXTRA reward
[1:46:26] <Badgerconda_> the wiki is wrong half the time, pat.
[1:46:27] <BunnyEmperor> lmao
[1:46:27] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat Either that or you made him mad when you didn't pick the "I'll keep it secret" option the first time
[1:46:29] <%templar010> apatBig apatHoldon
[1:46:29] <+Sonbunns> Pat is RIGHT
[1:46:30] <$Billyuppercut0> Plus patch
[1:46:33] <%Keyd00d> Is chat telling Pat lies again
[1:46:33] <hntronium> 4
[1:46:34] <DracaenaLeaf> the plus patch is the remake tbh
[1:46:34] <%JenovasPuppet> Why the fuck doesn't Pat have his Tremere room yet?
[1:46:34] <$Slimshazbot> The wiki has a lot of wrong bullshit on it tbf
[1:46:36] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> YOU GUYS ARE WRONG, IT SAYS ITS THE PLUS PATCH, I JUST CHECKED you all are liars
[1:46:37] <%manwithboxonhead> Yea it is only Unoffical Plus Patch
[1:46:40] <GothicLoveBlood> Probably your conversations with the wrong answers with him
[1:46:42] <%deviljhojho94> that cant be right?
[1:46:42] <kingra> Oooooooo fuck
[1:46:43] <antonius40k> I'm sure you can get it in the vanilla game. it's just that the vanilla game is a buggy busted trash fire unfortunately
[1:46:44] <DracaenaLeaf> I fixed something on thw weiki once
[1:46:44] <GothicLoveBlood> pissed him off
[1:46:45] <ooblag> Bullshit
[1:46:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Youwereeatenbyalid The reward they're talking about is not the haven.
[1:46:59] <$Slimshazbot> @Youwereeatenbyalid I literally did it two days ago
[1:47:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> what
[1:47:02] <%OldOnyx> @AngriestPat look for "tremere haven"
[1:47:03] <PhantaniumOG> We are not talking about the Fae charm chat FailFish
[1:47:08] <%copyritetm> its not the plus patch, you are just on the base unnoficial bug fix patch with no extra content changes
[1:47:14] <$Slimshazbot> @AngriestPat The haven is 100% related to iot
[1:47:15] <Frost_Quill> Fuck really? Aw man.
[1:47:16] <+Strigiform> look 1 paragraph down
[1:47:18] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Slimshazbot @Too_Much_Nukie WHAT NOW foools?
[1:47:19] <%shotgang86> BLAM
[1:47:26] <%mercado94> blam

[1:47:27] <%CappuccinoGuil> " If the fledgling is a Tremere, and has completed the quest A Plague for the Angels, Strauss will offer the Tremere Chantry as a new haven, and give the fledgling a proper induction into the clan as an apprentice. "
[1:47:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Youwereeatenbyalid Pat is wrong. I've got the changelog right here.
[1:47:32] <ミュウレ4242> oh, another changeling reference. suprised their stuff even works on vampires.
[1:47:36] <%THATGUY_789> THATGUY_789 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 23 month streak! G'day Pat been a long time since I caught you live and in colour as I've moved house and was on a cruise in the South Pacific. Just wanted to say thanks for all the entertainment and work you do to make my day that little less shitty. Godspeed
[1:47:40] <+Chocolatevgz> just noclip into the haven lol
[1:47:43] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Too_Much_Nukie I'm looking at the wiki, it says it right there
[1:47:44] <@lewdskeletor13> Are you saying Chat was... WRONG? Gasp
[1:47:53] <Kefkaisnotamused> Chat is cancer. You already said it was garbage.
[1:47:55] <PhantaniumOG> SEE
[1:47:57] <count_bob> You pissed off the regent.
[1:47:58] <+Chocolatevgz> This game is buggy shit yo
[1:47:58] <%mh9s> did you break it because of the plaugebearer quest?
[1:48:00] <count_bob> That's the problem.
[1:48:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Youwereeatenbyalid And I'm looking at the official changelog for the plus patch. Which do you trust more?
[1:48:02] <%deviljhojho94> Is this broken then¡
[1:48:02] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 Kirby's manefesto: I hate life. I hate it so much. And not in a "boo-hoo, poor me, life is pain" sort of way. (although my philisophical inclinations ARE predisposed to equating existance to suffering, I am diametrically opposed to suffering on a level.) No, I HATE it. Vehemently. It's very concept fills me with an eye-watering, teeth-shaking, brain-searing rage. I scream violently into the night in open fields, cursing reality itself for existing. You know when Pat puts on airs
[1:48:05] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Reload and talk to Isaac first?
[1:48:06] <+Chocolatevgz> JANK
[1:48:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> You fucked up when you told him you'd think about it.
[1:48:12] <jessicaamado> !uptime
[1:48:12] <mankeyfight> Did he talk to him before seeing the gargoyle?
[1:48:12] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 48m.
[1:48:13] <$Slimshazbot> @Youwereeatenbyalid That's for the fae charm, not the haven
[1:48:15] <%TeraMercier> Did he kill the gargoyle or talk him down? My roommate distracted me
[1:48:15] <benhart18> Jank levels rising
[1:48:16] <KaseKaizer> is it cause you said "I'll think about it"
[1:48:17] <%TheBigO75> Its a bug man
[1:48:18] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> hmmm
[1:48:18] <Kefkaisnotamused> You should have acted more like a Tremere bitch instead of being you, lol.
[1:48:20] <%Kavtech> You fucked up the conversation by taunting him.
[1:48:22] <ValidVenasaur> dont talk to strauss first maybe
[1:48:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Youwereeatenbyalid I can pull up the walkthrough I wrote for the base game, with no mods or patches, if you'd prefer.
[1:48:24] <ItsDeans> I'm so fucking confused.
[1:48:24] <GothicLoveBlood> You gave him the wrong answer BrokeBack
[1:48:24] <Conky89> I recall getting a reward after doing this? Is this a bug? Or am I wrong and it is only patch plus?
[1:48:27] <+Chocolatevgz> Let's just give it a try, yeah
[1:48:27] <overlordkog> I'm 99% sure it's cuz Pat said he'd think about it over just outright agreeing.
[1:48:27] <%deviljhojho94> its over
[1:48:30] <%manwithboxonhead> NO it is not
[1:48:31] <%OldOnyx> must of pissed off La Croix or Max too much
[1:48:32] <%Laecerelius> Good ol' save rotations
[1:48:33] <+nyfkieren17> use console
[1:48:35] <kirijotakeharu> @AngriestPat you can hack it with the console if you want
[1:48:35] <Frost_Quill> At least this isn't too far back I guess.
[1:48:35] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 Kirby's manefesto pt 2: to act like a hyper entitled piss baby not getting what they want? Or when someone takes part in ncreasingly absurd and cartoonish acts of evil, and you express your rage at it? THAT.
[1:48:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Youwereeatenbyalid I've beaten this game about 20 times.
[1:48:38] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> My bad was looking at the wrong section
[1:48:39] <ミュウレ4242> the tremere haven is pretty swanky.
[1:48:44] <ItsDeans> What the fuck is even happening?
[1:48:44] <TwinBat> it may have the go with the plague bearer quest
[1:48:48] <LtSergei> wednesday save then
[1:48:50] <+Implosivestar> Pat you save scumming whore, I love you

[1:49:08] <%deviljhojho94> maybe you pissed off strauss?
[1:49:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm pretty certain it's because he was a smarmy dick to Strauss and annoyed him.
[1:49:10] <%dukenux> Save Scumming is a legit strat
[1:49:10] <LtSergei> it was the first thing you did

[1:49:33] <%deviljhojho94> shoulda said "completely"
[1:49:35] <+Chocolatevgz> if the game cheats you out of it by bugging at least noclip in to grab it Kappa
[1:49:36] <@lewdskeletor13> I honestly don’t know what to believe anymore
[1:49:39] <%JenovasPuppet> @Rachet20 Yeah. Technically the very first one, since it came out before Half-Life 2
[1:49:42] <%CappuccinoGuil> you went to confession, got some money, then you went to the Chantry
[1:49:44] <%deviljhojho94> believe in yourself
[1:49:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> The wiki is almost as bad as the JoJo The Seventh Stand User wiki.
[1:49:47] <TwinBat> I read you have to get the plague bearer quest from straus, not damsel
[1:49:48] <Atheistpreacher> First source game ever made

[1:50:29] <dsauce999> AYAYA SUCC
[1:50:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> No cheats required, just be a good boy to Strauss.

[1:50:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Of course you have to be nice to the guy to live with him.
[1:50:55] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Cheat for that sweet stylish haven
[1:50:55] <+Chocolatevgz> Actually yeah if you were embraced within Tremere society you would've been enslaved to your elders by now lol
[1:50:55] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Chocolatevgz ...define blood dolls
[1:50:58] <%konekoryugamine> Yeah, the Vamprick!
[1:51:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also Max is by far the coolest Camarilla member in LA and I'll fight people on that.
[1:51:00] <$RubberFistFight> Pat, do an IDDQD and an IDKFA and win the game on ezmode
[1:51:09] <%JenovasPuppet> Could the haven thing have anything to do with the fact that Heather hasn't gotten rid of that body yet?
[1:51:10] <%manwithboxonhead> Yep
[1:51:11] <Marpolo13> o
[1:51:12] <%konekoryugamine> Oh, different Vamprick
[1:51:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Youwereeatenbyalid Blood dolls are NPCs, mostly women, you can seduce to let you suck them.
[1:51:15] <%deviljhojho94> gargo
[1:51:17] <%king_wragles> Wait, what did I miss?
[1:51:17] <+Chocolatevgz> Blood dolls are NPCs that exist to allow you to seduce them, etc., to get their blood
[1:51:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Then they can be sucked forever.
[1:51:23] <%king_wragles> I got up after he killed the gargoyle
[1:51:32] <Kefkaisnotamused> Beginning Tremere are automatically blood bound to their superiors. So acting like an asshole shows you dicked around and cheated the chalice ritual.
[1:51:32] <%dukenux> There it is
[1:51:35] <%machshop> ah, i see that you know your judo well
[1:51:35] <%Disname23> the big ass kisser
[1:51:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> there we go hopefully
[1:51:38] <BunnyEmperor> Yeah you pressed 2 here before
[1:51:39] <GothicLoveBlood> YOU DID IT PAT
[1:51:39] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Too_Much_Nukie jesus they're called blood dolls? Those are the prostitutes yes?
[1:51:40] <%deviljhojho94> we could have saved ourselves the trouble LUL
[1:51:42] <DracaenaLeaf> haha
[1:51:43] <%konekoryugamine> He just called you a fucking BABY
[1:51:44] <dsauce999> N E O NA T E
[1:51:44] <%dukenux> You needed to put more lube
[1:51:45] <count_bob> There we go.
[1:51:46] <%Laecerelius> If only you sucked up earlier!
[1:51:48] <Marpolo13> rad
[1:51:48] <shackbox> THANKER
[1:51:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> @king_wragles He was smarmy to Strauss when Strauss told him to keep it a secret, so he didn't get a Haven once he killed the Gargoyle.
[1:51:52] <DSD24> Its a condom
[1:51:53] <@lewdskeletor13> PogChamp
[1:51:53] <%deviljhojho94> THIS IS WHAT you GET FOR BEING SMARMY PAT
[1:51:56] <%king_wragles> Hey, remember when you guys said Pat didn't miss an item?
[1:51:58] <shackbox> LOOKS DUMB
[1:51:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Youwereeatenbyalid Not the prostitutes, the girls that keep shooting down Pat when he hits on them are Blood Dolls.
[1:51:58] <%gespenst25> it might be true to plague bearer as well..... it's obfuscated @angriestpat
[1:51:59] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Remember folks: don't be a dick
[1:52:00] <%spiritofmojave> Brownsniffer to victory
[1:52:01] <%konekoryugamine> Can a vampire even fuck
[1:52:02] <Frost_Quill> Yeah for like half the havens you have to asskiss either Strauss or LaCroix.
[1:52:02] <starotter70> You can talk the gargoyle down and just fucking lie about killing it @AngriestPat
[1:52:04] <%mh9s> SUCC up
[1:52:05] <Kefkaisnotamused> YES
[1:52:06] <Atzros> ALWAYS SUCK UP
[1:52:07] <%Laecerelius> Yes
[1:52:07] <finalgrinder> "plus patch" they said
[1:52:07] <KaseKaizer> yep
[1:52:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That was the item you missed.
[1:52:09] <Atzros> YES, you've got it
[1:52:09] <starotter70> yup
[1:52:10] <%deviljhojho94> Not always

[1:52:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> your learning
[1:52:11] <dsauce999> SUCC HARDER
[1:52:11] <DracaenaLeaf> Strauss is one of the better camerillas
[1:52:11] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Hell yeah
[1:52:12] <%OldOnyx> That is correct
[1:52:12] <gustavozxd> suck stab
[1:52:13] <LtSergei> don't backstab max he's the best
[1:52:13] <stolando_florida> That's human nature kinda

[1:52:14] <%gespenst25> sounds about right
[1:52:15] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat This riddler token will protect you from the gargoyle
[1:52:15] <GothicLoveBlood> Plus patch kids btfo
[1:52:16] <BigCoffee> yeah!
[1:52:16] <%deviljhojho94> Strauss does good for you

[1:52:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you understand

[1:52:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> You have finally learned to vampire.
[1:52:24] <%manwithboxonhead> Lesson: Suck up to Strauss always.
[1:52:25] <Kefkaisnotamused> Suck up, then literally SUCK your elders to death and take their generation.
[1:52:25] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I know this game like I know my own dick!
[1:52:25] <%Disname23> crab nipple
[1:52:26] <starotter70> Crab Nipple
[1:52:26] <ValidVenasaur> "plus patch only"
[1:52:26] <%THATGUY_789> sounds like the Pat way
[1:52:27] <aimlesshealer> Give 'em the ol' suck'n'stab
[1:52:28] <+daisyyyy> They get mad when you dont
[1:52:29] <%deviljhojho94> this is our clan way
[1:52:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> +patch LUL
[1:52:30] <dsauce999> Nah, you gotta SCRAPE and LICK
[1:52:32] <%mh9s> c r a b n i p p l e
[1:52:33] <%Laecerelius> We know, Pat
[1:52:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Everyone who said Plus Patch is the wrongest.
[1:52:35] <Huntercd> Did Pat pork Jeanette?
[1:52:36] <alexandrecau> sucer debout c'Est se tenir droit
[1:52:38] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> I can see that
[1:52:39] <ameraaaaaa> exactly
[1:52:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> Crab nipple is the vampire way
[1:52:43] <Atzros> You're a neonate, and they have what you want, so you've gotta slurp on their big floppy vampire dong
[1:52:43] <DSD24> @Huntercd Pretty sure he did
[1:52:44] <PerrinIsDead> Suck up and back suck
[1:52:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, then why did you pick Tremere?
[1:52:44] <%konekoryugamine> "Stompin' on ants and suckin' their souls, STOMPIN' ON ANTS, SOUL SOUL SOU;"
[1:52:45] <BunnyEmperor> @Huntercd yes
[1:52:48] <%Laecerelius> He fucked her then loaded
[1:52:48] <%konekoryugamine> ADVENTURE TIME
[1:52:48] <%deviljhojho94> but in vampire society, you gotta suck up and suck in
[1:52:48] <%dukenux> Vampire's life is all about Succing out and succing up
[1:52:49] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat so is this the plus patch?
[1:52:50] <starotter70> But what if money
[1:52:50] <+InstiGaitan> Paige would disagree
[1:52:54] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Waste of blud
[1:52:55] <%manwithboxonhead> The Brujah would have been your clan.
[1:52:56] <@lewdskeletor13> Pat time traveled to get rid of having sex with Jeanette
[1:52:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @king_wragles No.
[1:52:58] <ameraaaaaa> vampires are backstabbing assholes
[1:53:02] <count_bob> You gotta succ up to get the succ.
[1:53:04] <Frost_Quill> Vampire society is all about sucking up to people, kicking around those under you, and then sucking some more. Sucking blood.
[1:53:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> magic~~~
[1:53:05] <Huntercd> Damn it I missed the porking!!
[1:53:06] <%JenovasPuppet> Yeah, undead no blood flow porking
[1:53:08] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Blood magic power seems fun
[1:53:08] <ItsDeans> Dude if this doesn't work then I'm disappointed in the chat
[1:53:09] <%Aydarkzero> pocket blood?
[1:53:09] <Marpolo13> maaaaaagic
[1:53:09] <mankeyfight> You undid the porking
[1:53:10] <T_Sasquatch> what
[1:53:10] <%TheBigO75> The fact that you're an independantsays alot about you
[1:53:11] <DSD24> Got that Vampire Azula bed
[1:53:11] <BunnyEmperor> And because he likes to watch people vomit BLUD
[1:53:12] <gustavozxd> blood syringe
[1:53:12] <dsauce999> UHHHH
[1:53:14] <GothicLoveBlood> Your conversations in this game matter SeemsGood
[1:53:16] <%goose_attack_almanac> Isn't Strauss like... SUPER forthcoming about everything?
[1:53:17] <DracaenaLeaf> blood magic is great, Skarlet best Mk character
[1:53:17] <%king_wragles> I know it's not the plus patch, I just find it funny to bring up the counter-salt
[1:53:18] <Conky89> Do you believe in magic then?
[1:53:18] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Don't you hate seeing your blood?
[1:53:19] <Frost_Quill> What's that smell? It's BLOOD.
[1:53:20] <Huntercd> Which stream was it?
[1:53:21] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Huntercd he undid the porking to play uno instead
[1:53:21] <Badgerconda_> because tremere is the perfect clan for pat. They're a bunch of cheaty bastards.
[1:53:23] <juxtest> Its not YOUR blood
[1:53:24] <%spiritofmojave> @lewdskeletor13 least he got some board games out of it I guess LUL
[1:53:25] <%Verd_254> how do you like blood mages but find human fluids gross
[1:53:25] <Kefkaisnotamused> Blud. Bleh bleh.
[1:53:25] <%Eclipse_knight_> whut. you always magic is for bitches
[1:53:26] <ZZCooldown> @AngriestPat but you are mostly punching people?
[1:53:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @goose_attack_almanac Only if you're Tremre.
[1:53:28] <%THATGUY_789> so you like throwing aids at peeps. might as well have a syringe
[1:53:31] <PerrinIsDead> Suck up to suck down??
[1:53:31] <%deviljhojho94> Strauss is unironically the only reasonable camarilla authority figure in the game
[1:53:32] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Uh.....
[1:53:34] <%TheBigO75> FFS you make your money on the internet. Try doing that shit working 9-5
[1:53:34] <+JackMillerTime> yes
[1:53:34] <%dukenux> You like the sight of your own BLUD?
[1:53:35] <shackbox> in a young girls heart?
[1:53:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Badgerconda_ They are to everyone who isn't Tremere.
[1:53:37] <%deviljhojho94> no
[1:53:38] <SparkAfterDark> Considering how terrified you are of random hostile hypodermic needles, you're extremely interested in aggressive surprise blood swapping
[1:53:42] <dsauce999> YOU KNOOOOWWWW
[1:53:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If you're not Tremere you have to pass a difficult persuasion check to get info about the gargoyle.
[1:53:46] <%Rngiddion> so youre like a vampire chimpanzee? one step above throwing your shit at an enemy is throwing your blood at them
[1:53:46] <icantstopthescreams> Pat has [METALLICA]
[1:53:48] <DracaenaLeaf> oh god the voices lol
[1:53:49] <PerrinIsDead> MAc
[1:53:55] <%AncelDeLambert> what, him again?
[1:53:56] <Atzros> @GothicLoveBlood lmao, you know, that seems obvious, but a lot of people are just so used to their choices not mattering they always go for the smart-ass replies
[1:53:56] <InugamiTheHound> you flaming idiots!!
[1:53:56] <NocturnalRites> Naw Malkavian is Pat, what with all the mind goblins
[1:53:58] <ミュウレ4242> ♪got to believe we are magic. nothing can stand in our way.♪
[1:53:59] <$RubberFistFight> holy shit he's talking over himself like crazy
[1:54:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh his voice is overlapping.
[1:54:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[1:54:01] <ItsDeans> Actually, what clan would Pat be if he was to be categorized as one?
[1:54:01] <%AbnormalVoid> Me Tommy
[1:54:02] <aimlesshealer> Patula's one of those lizards that squirts blood out of its eyes
[1:54:03] <%spiritofmojave> You know- yes
[1:54:05] <Monkeyweed21> SAVE
[1:54:09] <%konekoryugamine> @AngriestPat Don'T hate me for saying this . . . THIS REMINDS ME OF OMIKRON!
[1:54:09] <%AncelDeLambert> are we punching rocks again?
[1:54:12] <%mh9s> that was some malk shit
[1:54:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @ItsDeans Probably Tremere actually.
[1:54:15] <%manwithboxonhead> Fuck him again
[1:54:17] <%Laecerelius> ROCK PUNCHER!
[1:54:18] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, what did the granite do to you?
[1:54:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> @konekoryugamine Go home.
[1:54:20] <Wan6Saber> @AncelDeLambert yes
[1:54:23] <Zombrocom> Neat
[1:54:24] <%manwithboxonhead> Third Strike
[1:54:27] <%nekodelic> @angriestpat would Paige play this game as a Malkavian so we can get a fresh first experience?
[1:54:27] <%konekoryugamine> @CommanderSqueaks Nay
[1:54:29] <DSD24> Superhero Landing
[1:54:30] <Triplicat> COME, SEKIRO
[1:54:31] <Zombrocom> That's a golem
[1:54:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Tremere all have OCD, really bad OCD that makes them re-attempt things until they get them perfect.
[1:54:32] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @ItsDeans Malkavian, almost certainly
[1:54:32] <GothicLoveBlood> @Atzros true LUL that's why i love this game
[1:54:34] <%dukenux> @ItsDeans mind goblins say Malk
[1:54:36] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@AncelDeLambert) (warning)
[1:54:38] <PerrinIsDead> MOk japan

[1:54:53] <DSD24> Time to break your bones Gargoyle
[1:54:54] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Pat would be malk, maaaybe a nossy
[1:54:54] <Zombrocom> FISTICUFFS

[1:54:55] <ItsDeans> @too_much_nukie But wouldn't Crazy talk be a manifestation of a malk
[1:54:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is why he's the best.
[1:54:56] <Zooperton> invincible PogChamp
[1:54:56] <aimlesshealer> Magiiiiiic!
[1:54:56] <antonius40k> I still refuse to believe this is a gargoyle. safe for maybe the face this is literally just a stone golem. playing d&d makes you jaded to these things
[1:54:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:54:57] <%JenovasPuppet> @nekodelic Pat said he might do a second playthrough as a Malk. I doubt Paige would go with Malk on her first run.
[1:54:58] <%konekoryugamine> 6 STRING SAMURAI
[1:54:58] <%dukenux> He was always a bit of a bitch
[1:54:58] <Wan6Saber> WOW

[1:55:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> how embarassing
[1:55:17] <Mr_Strut> More like a golem than a gargoyle
[1:55:19] <+InstiGaitan> killed by my own son
[1:55:19] <pectusumbra> That's what happens when you use all your MAGIC
[1:55:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @ItsDeans Malkavians are extremely broad. Their madnesses come in infinite flavors.
[1:55:19] <%Laecerelius> PAT CASTS FIST!
[1:55:19] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Huh that looks like a monkey samurai not a gargoyle
[1:55:20] <%THATGUY_789> I feel Pat should be breaking through a wall
[1:55:22] <%konekoryugamine> "You can't kill me! I'M ALREADY DEAD!"
[1:55:24] <KeystoneA1> Paige should do Toreador or Ventrue first time
[1:55:24] <alexandrecau> die for the klan slve

[1:55:30] <OzzySnek> Can't you also do a diplomacy check on that thing to befriend it for Kindred?
[1:55:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Malkavians are the perfect SECOND RUN playthrough, because you actually understand the context that makes their insane rambling make senses.
[1:55:32] <DSD24> "Annihilated!"
[1:55:33] <juxtest> I cast Blood Fist
[1:55:34] <dsauce999> YOU CANNOT KILL ME
[1:55:36] <rytisone> shoulda sawed it in half with a laser
[1:55:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> A real mage stomps ass in a fist fight, because buffs are king.

[1:57:07] <+Chocolatevgz> I never knew Isaac was a Toreador until recently, saw him talk about old Hollywood shit so much and I thought "oh duh"
[1:57:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Chocolatevgz V like from DMC V. Not VV.

[1:57:45] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 today, as I was closing my line, some guy at the very back of the line, who wasn't even near the belt mind you, refused to get off. then his card had issues. so he ran off to the atm to withdraw some money. because of this I got out late, had to wait 20 minutes to get punched out by a manager, and by the time I got out (the time I should have gotten home. it starts to rain so bad my pants get soaked through, even with my umbrella up. It's this kind of shit that reinforces my mindset.

[1:57:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Lasombra are the best vampires. Don't trust anybody who tells you that Lasombra aren't to be trusted, or that they aren't the strongest.
[1:57:53] <%spiritofmojave> Hell yeah
[1:57:53] <Marpolo13> you need blood pat

[1:58:03] <DracaenaLeaf> they are the gun class after all
[1:58:03] <%CJett92> No, they just walk slower

[1:58:09] <ItsDeans> mercurio pat dont forget him
[1:58:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> Celerity makes you fast. Level 1 can be used in public
[1:58:10] <%dukenux> Max Paynetula
[1:58:10] <GothicLoveBlood> They pretty much the go to pick for op gun build
[1:58:11] <takokasa> Toreadors are matrix charactes
[1:58:12] <KingOfTheGeats> it makes the zombie graveyard fight fun
[1:58:12] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Hard C, Pat
[1:58:12] <+RushUnplugged> Toreadors are GREAT for shooty shooty times
[1:58:13] <juxtest> Mmm celery
[1:58:13] <Chester_goes_Berserk> They're actually the strongest clan in the game
[1:58:13] <DSD24> Plus the Male Toreador is this game looks really cool
[1:58:15] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat nicely!
[1:58:15] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Its free money
[1:58:15] <zecht89> blud, bluuuuud
[1:58:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> After a certain level, Celerity in this game is pretty much Time Stop.
[1:58:17] <Conky89> Toreador are the clan that should use shooty shooty bang bang.
[1:58:19] <DracaenaLeaf> throw her liek the useless hoe she is
[1:58:24] <%GoldeNOVA> I played as a Toreador, I became a big gun man
[1:58:25] <%bread_assassin> From a total outsider,Toreador's seem pretty low tier.
[1:58:25] <Marpolo13> that's one way to put it
[1:58:25] <Atzros> Humes can see that you're moving super fast, so it's a masquerade violation
[1:58:29] <%AllyBeeBoo> you always leave that apartment to go straight back in
[1:58:29] <$Slimshazbot> Lady Tremere is my favorite player model in this game
[1:58:30] <mankeyfight> It's free real estate
[1:58:31] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@rovilm) (warning)
[1:58:33] <+Chocolatevgz> I like the male toreador model but his best armor is red and it matches his hair and it hurts my fucking eyes
[1:58:34] <rytisone> succ me master
[1:58:36] <ancrest_tant> Mr. Boivin
[1:58:36] <%NovaKnightmare> why isnt she wearing pants
[1:58:37] <reiju_22> just f
[1:58:37] <%TheBigO75> LUL
[1:58:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> @bread_assassin They're great and kissing ass and running away.
[1:58:38] <%deviljhojho94> toreador and brujah are specatular thanks to celerity, but they are pretty boring otherwise
[1:58:38] <RupanSen> lvl 5 celerity is the most OP discipline of the game
[1:58:40] <LtSergei> pat open the console and enter "money 3"
[1:58:40] <rovilm> master of puppets im pulling your strings
[1:58:42] <%laserbeaming> Mean S U C C

[1:58:44] <%GarbageNirvana> Still no pants I see
[1:58:46] <%wvuboii> jeez
[1:58:47] <%Kirby_Sauce> when you realize the chtulu blood chalaice is just a punch card...
[1:58:47] <+Chocolatevgz> what's she need pants for lol
[1:58:48] <DSD24> You are putting your hand through her head
[1:58:48] <Ion_Laser> mEAN SUCC
[1:58:48] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @LtSergei why?
[1:58:49] <Wan6Saber> mean succ kiaaS
[1:58:50] <Kefkaisnotamused> You may have glitched it when you turned the guy into a wraith.
[1:58:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @bread_assassin They're high-tier but they're not frontline fighters in the lore. In game they're top-tier because of how Celerity works in a video game.
[1:58:53] <LtSergei> it's funny
[1:58:54] <%king_wragles> Question: why is she wearing heels and no pants?
[1:58:54] <%spiritofmojave> I like how he just shoves his hand meshed through her face
[1:58:55] <BunnyEmperor> lmao the push every time
[1:58:56] <fearhurst> succler
[1:58:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> @GarbageNirvana Do YOU wear pants at home?
[1:59:02] <%spiritofmojave> The jank in this is incredible
[1:59:04] <aimlesshealer> Pants are merely power limiters
[1:59:05] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Also isn't it kind of weird she isn't giving the suck blood option?
[1:59:05] <DSD24> @king_wragles Pat made her wear that
[1:59:05] <%goose_attack_almanac> Jeez, Ghoul Paige
[1:59:06] <mankeyfight> MERCURIO

[1:59:21] <NocturnalRites> lvl 5 Celerity might be fun but so is Warform
[1:59:21] <pectusumbra> when you killed him and his body turned into a shadow
[1:59:24] <+Chocolatevgz> this game only has one wraith doesn't it
[1:59:24] <%GarbageNirvana> @CommanderSqueaks I mean...sometimes?
[1:59:24] <Atzros> when you shadow realm'd the guy in your apartment
[1:59:26] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> he refuses

[1:59:30] <Monkeyweed21> buy ammo
[1:59:32] <+Chocolatevgz> yeah he don't have the ruffles yet
[1:59:33] <Kefkaisnotamused> @AngriestPat Well, you bit him and he turned into a charred stain on the floor. I'm embellishing.
[1:59:33] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Oh boy a KNIFE
[1:59:33] <%manwithboxonhead> Cant even clean the blood off the floor and door and sofa
[1:59:33] <%spiritofmojave> I still think Mercurio looks like jermaDafoe
[1:59:34] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL heading straight for Mercurio while the chat LOSES THEIR SHIT
[1:59:34] <antonius40k> someone should really clean up all that damn blood
[1:59:38] <%dukenux> He's too crooked too look straight, Pat Kappa
[1:59:39] <Conky89> This is low tier stuff.

[1:59:54] <%mrberserker97> mrberserker97 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:59:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> Dude clipped through the floor and disappeared
[1:59:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> Is Mercurio the one with the rad body armor later?
[1:59:59] <1matheuw> crossed a dude straitgh into the shadow realm
[2:00:00] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Who did pat send to the shadowrealm?
[2:00:01] <GothicLoveBlood> Should wait after you progress through the game
[2:00:04] <+Chocolatevgz> This night club is DANGEROUS

[2:00:27] <thwak> chat how far are we from the worst sewer level in video game history?
[2:00:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think, Toreador are probably the clan I cannot stand the most. Not for any mechanical reason, I just don't like them.
[2:00:35] <%deviljhojho94> not too far now....

[2:00:40] <fearhurst> just a minut
[2:00:42] <%Disname23> @thwak should be soon
[2:00:43] <%mh9s> we are pretty close to the sewers
[2:00:43] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @CappuccinoGuil that girl aint right I tell you hwat
[2:00:43] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> He had a run-in with a gangbang
[2:00:43] <pectusumbra> ah, I missed it looking at chat
[2:00:44] <Monkeyweed21> Twice even
[2:00:45] <+Grayhammatter> the mailbox pat
[2:00:47] <%king_wragles> @laserbeaming fair point, but he has all this morphine he needs to eat before it spoils!
[2:00:48] <%AncelDeLambert> apatBig 3
[2:00:49] <mankeyfight> You should go check out the Last Round?
[2:00:51] <NocturnalRites> The Toreador are too far up their own ass thats why
[2:00:52] <%skizzuto> the locker
[2:00:56] <%spiritofmojave> Like several missions until the sewer labyrinth to end all labyrinths
[2:00:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYE
[2:00:58] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, now I'M getting tired of the backseat gaming
[2:00:59] <@lewdskeletor13> Pat why do you even listen to chat
[2:01:01] <@commanderclaw> Chat's a apatBig 3 today
[2:01:01] <rovilm> How about the vampire clan that sustains themselves by sucking human feces
[2:01:02] <ItsDeans> Mercurio not cleaning his place. fine, that's understandable. But a janitor should have cleaned up the hallway at some point.
[2:01:02] <%manwithboxonhead> @CommanderSqueaks They most embody the Twlight Vampire that everyone dislikes.
[2:01:04] <%deviljhojho94> YEYEYEYEY
[2:01:04] <@lewdskeletor13> We’re garbo
[2:01:06] <DSD24> @CommanderSqueaks I love when you play as a Toreador and when you need to talk to a group of Nosferatu they all talk shit
[2:01:06] <+DeaconBluesClues> is this morpheus wampire
[2:01:09] <+Chocolatevgz> I liked Toreador until I got to the combat-heavy endgame and found that I didn't do enough side quests to afford all the xp to buy combat shit after all the social shit I bought
[2:01:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If you go to The Last Round you can talk to Jake the Dog about stuff.
[2:01:17] <BunnyEmperor> Shut up and teach me Ultima
[2:01:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> @NocturnalRites They're also terrible at art, it's canon that they can only make poor imitations. The Nosferatu are better artists than Toreador because they can actually create something original.
[2:01:18] <Ion_Laser> Chat's fucking up again...as usual
[2:01:21] <pipboy344> Did Pat play the first game?
[2:01:23] <gustavozxd> only on the plus patch

[2:03:51] <mankeyfight> The Last Round?
[2:03:54] <ItsDeans> does anyone else see the cursor
[2:03:56] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Mouse was freaking out in there.
[2:03:57] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat Your mouse was flickering in the Chantry for some reason
[2:03:57] <%NWR_James> @commanderclaw especially the gold shotgun from yakuza 0
[2:03:59] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> O...K? Nvm mouse good now?
[2:03:59] <%dukenux> The batchroo m
[2:03:59] <rovilm> take a vampire shit
[2:04:01] <+Chocolatevgz> Anarchs don't really have a haven
[2:04:01] <krymzen5> vampires poop?
[2:04:04] <+Chocolatevgz> not for you anyway
[2:04:06] <%spiritofmojave> Why would vampire's need one anyway
[2:04:07] <ItsDeans> okay. so I want crazy
[2:04:07] <%THATGUY_789> do vamps own plasma TVs
[2:04:07] <Marpolo13> dayum
[2:04:08] <energywarning> TWO sinks?!
[2:04:08] <Ion_Laser> mouse is good now
[2:04:08] <KaseKaizer> Vampires gotta shit too... I think?
[2:04:10] <rovilm> look at that nasty shower
[2:04:10] <%Disname23> the biggest of dumps
[2:04:11] <%AllyBeeBoo> ew the shower is gross
[2:04:11] <Ion_Laser> BIG DUMPS
[2:04:12] <%mh9s> big blood dumps
[2:04:12] <%TheBigO75> Blood dumps
[2:04:12] <starotter70> Well shit
[2:04:13] <%laserbeaming> That's a nice bathroom
[2:04:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The biggest of shits.
[2:04:15] <Kefkaisnotamused> Vampires don't doodie.
[2:04:17] <DracaenaLeaf> damn vampires
[2:04:18] <@commanderclaw> Vampires don't shit anymore
[2:04:18] <%GarbageNirvana> Do vampires even need to shit
[2:04:20] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Wait
[2:04:20] <aimlesshealer> Vampire dumps? Clots?
[2:04:20] <ShichiNoBushi> Big bloody dumps.
[2:04:20] <%manwithboxonhead> Soulforge that Guy into a Toilet
[2:04:21] <%skizzuto> BIG VAMPIRE DuMPS
[2:04:21] <%dukenux> Well, you're a vampire
[2:04:24] <@absolute_weapon> All you eat is blood
[2:04:26] <+Chocolatevgz> That's what bummed me out about this game - you can be pro-anarchs but all the main story shit is mostly governed by king shorty
[2:04:26] <faldin> do vampires poop blood or pee it?
[2:04:27] <augmentedmadman> You could take some nice waffle stomps in that shower
[2:04:27] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> where'd the succ go?
[2:04:29] <%spiritofmojave> Big wet dumps
[2:04:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think they put Strauss in the game to make the Camarilla SOMEWHAT likeable in this game. "Hey guys, not everyone is LaCroix, he's just a dick."
[2:04:29] <@absolute_weapon> not sure much can come out the other end
[2:04:31] <icantstopthescreams> Vampires love to take big meat shits
[2:04:31] <Croetec> time for VV Kreygasm
[2:04:32] <Kefkaisnotamused> Vampires throw up what they eat because everything tastes like ash.
[2:04:33] <NocturnalRites> Vampires can shower so theres that
[2:04:33] <rytisone> only clothes should reflect
[2:04:34] <afraidanuffin> Why do vampires need toilets? They're on an all liquid diet...OF BLOOD
[2:04:34] <InugamiTheHound> poop full of red blood?
[2:04:35] <Conky89> Spacious bathroom. Vampires certainly have it made.
[2:04:37] <krymzen5> do vampires just magic the shit away?
[2:04:38] <Ion_Laser> can take BIG BLOOD VOMITS IN THERE
[2:04:38] <KaseKaizer> the lab again
[2:04:41] <%copyritetm> only vampires of the lasombra clan have no reflection actually
[2:04:41] <rovilm> jollywood
[2:04:42] <mankeyfight> Last Round?
[2:04:44] <DSD24> Back and to the left
[2:04:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, have you gone to Vesuvius yet?
[2:04:45] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Not to be confused with the hollow knight
[2:04:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> now I want to front a band called Sex Bathroom.
[2:04:47] <%dukenux> "Doctor, there's blood in my stool"
[2:04:48] <DracaenaLeaf> I wonder if Bloodlines 2 will include reflections or not, I imagine they would since garlic doesn't work
[2:04:51] <+Chocolatevgz> vamps don't need toilet cause they have no bodily fluids, save blood
[2:04:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Lasombra #1
[2:04:55] <+Chocolatevgz> They sweat blood
[2:04:57] <+Chocolatevgz> It's dumb
[2:04:58] <ItsDeans> wait... would vampires poop? what would their body not digest. like peeing, I'd understand, but pooping? immersion breaking.
[2:04:58] <DSD24> Speed Walking!
[2:05:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> Only Lasombra have no reflection. Also sun fucks them extra hard.
[2:05:03] <GothicLoveBlood> They don't eat anything nothing to poop out
[2:05:03] <%THATGUY_789> the only time blood in yr stool is good is if yr a vamp I guess
[2:05:14] <HeadsHeldHigh> Vampires ARE blood. Everything in their body is blood except the heart I think
[2:05:16] <Kefkaisnotamused> Vamps can have bodily fluids, but it costs a lot of blood and only lasts like an hour unless you have like 8 or 9 humanity.
[2:05:17] <%deviljhojho94> disgostang
[2:05:17] <RupanSen> the taxi driver is actually Kiryu
[2:05:17] <+Taglog7> Yah, take the 405 down to mohalland
[2:05:18] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Now it is time for pat to SUCC
[2:05:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ItsDeans Vampires cannot digest something that isn't blood. It becomes a blood slurry and they vomit it up.
[2:05:21] <KeystoneA1> @ItsDeans They can use blood energy to feign being alive again, including digestion
[2:05:21] <%Laecerelius> GROSS!
[2:05:23] <Huntercd> so how does Jeanette have sex without fluids?
[2:05:23] <NocturnalRites> Yeah its all that shadow juice that fucks over the Lasombra
[2:05:24] <%Disname23> the gamer goo is taking over
[2:05:25] <DSD24> @GeneralSCPatton More than a normal Vampire being hit with the sun?
[2:05:26] <icantstopthescreams> !uptime
[2:05:26] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 5m.
[2:05:27] <ShichiNoBushi> They pretty much have no biological functions other than eating.

Each one has different rules on what is considered acceptable or a violation. Your Humanity has to drop to 3 or less before you can reject it like DIO.

[2:38:24] <%goose_attack_almanac> @rdark_ksu Pat punched a Gargoyle to death, moved in with Blood Mages with Ghoul-proto-Paige, exploded a stripper, got yelled at by an incredibly busty "dancer" in a corset and thong. Reloaded to make the hunter-stripper kill herself. Velvet, the "Dancer" with the breathy voice liked that attempt. Now she's asked him to ruin a man's movie script because he co-wrote it with an actual friggin vampire who screwed up har.
[2:38:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You did the right thing.
[2:38:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> 5 minutes of dancing = 1 murder

[2:47:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> To be perfectly fair, and it's not a spoiler, but the reason Isaac turned this guy into a vampire is because found Ash in the middle of a suicide attempt and did it to save his life. So... okay, he's an ungrateful shit, but I get why he's moody.

[2:53:58] <%spiritofmojave> All Toreadors besides VV are mistakes
[2:53:58] <+Mittensbro> I love the idea that pat's player character says that really sarcastically, then mutters "pompous piece o shit..." under his breath as he walks away

[2:55:09] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 a few streams ago (hades I think) I made a cheer regarding how olympus overdrive was like zatchbell, which is a better Fate. And you said you'd never heard of it. "Never have I heard a more disingenuous lie, made even worse, coming from you" (TTS quote, but applicable) YOU. You haven't heard or FATE. Not Fate/stay, not zero, not unlimited blade works. YOU, from whom I heard that Japanese smash players wanted Saber in smash.

[2:55:55] <+ShadowArcangel> DIO is 100% a Toreador
[2:55:56] <augusm> @Too_Much_Nukie Right I understand, cheers I thought I was going mad for a few minutes
[2:55:56] <Kefkaisnotamused> Dio would likely even BE Toreador.

[3:02:07] <Renkage> To be honest. With Malkavian. I kinda want a "Wacky Malkavian Advnture" DLC. Have it be it's own thing. Because Malkavian isn't a clan, it's a disease. You can be any Clan and also be a Malkavian. At least that's what I remember, it has been awhile.
[3:02:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> @ithirstforfreddurst they reference bush, not especifically George
