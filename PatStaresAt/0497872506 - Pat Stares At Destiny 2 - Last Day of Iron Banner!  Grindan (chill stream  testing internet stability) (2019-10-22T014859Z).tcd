[0:04:28] <%Valdorick> Its just F1
[0:04:28] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
[0:04:28] <%logoth_> Elmo is secretly sapient
[0:04:28] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat F1 with IE open
[0:04:30] <+WorldsBestPanda> At least you don't have to worry about Elmo putting his balls on stream.

[0:04:48] <%ShineTheDiamond> Elmo is the real star of the stream

[0:13:10] <absolute_cagemony> red hair, red bars
[0:13:11] <%miguelrod777> You'll never reach the server
[0:13:11] <%RubberFistFight> Certain kinds of faults are more apparent with streaming than with gaming, because streaming requires 100% uninterrupted traffic. ANY amount of dropped packets or interruptions, regardless of how small/short, will cause a disconnect, because the RTMP server sees it as a cessation of the stream i.e. a disconnection.
[0:13:13] <%MalekDracarus> Those are champions pat :)
[0:13:14] <%bluetocho13> Pat got cursed with red bar

[0:13:56] <%dekkitout> Did Ssaryn forget which one was penumbra and anteumbra? Kappa
[0:13:58] <%President_Miyazaki> Tell him if he stands on something again you'll give him 3 meats.
[0:14:04] <VJdarkworld> if only we had negative latency ....
[0:14:05] <shadowsofpain> So what are your thoughts on Last Wish and how did it compare to Leviathan?
[0:14:08] <%MegboyManuel> someone make a "dont stand on that ssaryn" meme
[0:14:16] <DigTheSquig> Scourge is the beyond easy
[0:14:19] <%deviljhojho94> we playin some destiny tonite boys

[0:14:36] <ScreamLord> And the number goes up
[0:14:37] <+FennecZephyr> Like the one from Warmind
[0:14:40] <%ShockzNDrawe> II like the last part where we ran with the heart

[0:15:14] <+D00msDayDan> you can, it's called going back to the castellum
[0:15:15] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I hear Ssaryn is a baby
[0:15:25] <%Aeoneth> ... You know you could go to the Castellum after each encounter to get to the next one rightÉ
[0:15:31] <chambatron> Well you can open the doors if you just get the 3 medallions and put them on their spot
[0:15:34] <%ShockzNDrawe> we sure did
[0:15:40] <EternalFenix42> You normally go back to the Castellum (opening area) after every encounter in Leviathan.
[0:15:40] <%ShockzNDrawe> yeah it is
[0:15:41] <%dekkitout> No one knows how to do Riven properly
[0:15:45] <%valriot> GO IN THE HEART
[0:15:53] <shadowsofpain> you can always go back to the castelum and go from encounter to encounter
[0:15:54] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Riven is basically the Vault but even bullshiter
[0:15:58] <%ShockzNDrawe> I figured out how I died at the end
[0:15:58] <%Iccirrus> You need to do riven legit once

[0:29:46] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat I've been doing nuzlockes of the gen 1 2 and 3 remakes and those games are more fun than I remember
[0:29:47] <frozenballz> try a sweet business with actium war rig chest piece titan btw
[0:29:48] <%Kiiper> sweet business is fun
[0:29:50] <IndoorSitup> The National Dex died for Little Town Hero.
[0:29:52] <frozenballz> it's fucking HILARIOUS in pvp.
[0:29:52] <ScreamLord> What does the Monti Carlo do in D2?
[0:30:01] <frozenballz> you can shut down supers so fast with it it's amazing
[0:30:05] <%Maids4lyfe> Pat I think your ship needs to be mowed.
[0:30:08] <chambatron> Horror Story is hella good
[0:30:10] <%Ascethetic> nah, hunter main

[0:30:13] <%dekkitout> The catalyst Cerberus with Actium is wild
[0:30:14] <+D00msDayDan> @AngriestPat i like to call that combo the war economy

[0:30:39] <%valriot> @angriestpat I have a Arc Logic with Subsistence and Demolitionist, it's basically Grenade Monte Carlo
[0:30:52] <frozenballz> i think the best thing about the sweet business is everyone can hear you across the map and think "lol he's using sweet business" and peak you, not realising a fully spooled up sweet business will absolutely DESTROY them lmao
[0:30:53] <%Kirby_Sauce> because you're not being cheap
[0:30:57] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Oh yeah I love Sweet Business. Gatling Rifles are one of my favorite weapon concepts
[0:30:59] <+djinnJuice> I can't get through the part where you have to use filler gear until you get to cap, it's especially bad in pvp
[0:31:00] <%QueequegTheater> mercy rule incoming
[0:31:02] <%depressed_skeleton> Pat is carrying team

[0:31:25] <+puffinup> the infinite range autorifle is good if you hipfire it

[0:33:15] <Drunkengen> ah Yes Destiny
[0:33:25] <+puffinup> HITTING THAT HEADSHOT WITH A SLUG SO CASUALLY

[0:33:33] <%Posh_Cat> Polaris Lance is great

[0:33:34] <IndoorSitup> RANDY NOOO
[0:33:35] <%QueequegTheater> @Lapinelis Halo
[0:33:36] <%Iccirrus> needs all 3 ritual weapons and a bunch of other shit
[0:33:37] <%Nope80808> I hate fusion rifles and stuggle with them muself.
[0:33:41] <%rytyoung> I was grinding headshots for the Ace of Spades
[0:33:43] <ScreamLord> Randy's Throwing Knife? That's hilarious
[0:33:55] <%UncleAWOL> destiny is weird in that you can play with a gamepad and do pretty good
[0:33:56] <%LiquidShake83> do it
[0:33:59] <%QueequegTheater> The Ace of Spades should've been a Hunter exclusive like it used to be
[0:34:02] <MasterDecoder> Implying it's hard to play FPS with Controller
[0:34:03] <%Gohyakuen> See? he's doing it
[0:34:06] <%Lapinelis> I'm like a paraplegic any time I try to aim with one D:
[0:34:12] <mayorrev> Gyro controls are a godsend for shooter games
[0:34:13] <%valriot> Iron Banner is fucking trash anyway
[0:34:15] <%ShockzNDrawe> To translate from Halo to Destiny: Auto is the Assault Rifle, Pulse is Battle Riffle, and Scout is DMR

[0:34:46] <Scrub_Seeker> y'know i keep hearing people talk up D2's pvp and coming from warframe i dont see how its any different than conclave which everyone hates
[0:34:48] <%Deekman> 🤷🏻♂️
[0:34:51] <mayorrev> do any other companies utilize gyro aim
[0:34:55] <%Roasted_Pheasant> The best advice of Sanford "Hide Your Sticks" Kelly

[0:35:28] <%mh9s> taste that that sweat
[0:35:28] <frozenballz> IB is usually always sweaty. i usually end up doing comp during IB since comp is actually alot more chill during IB lol
[0:35:35] <%ShineTheDiamond> Pat it helps to aim...
[0:35:36] <%RubberFistFight> oh my god this fucken old lady in Shani's house in Witcher 1. Goddamn RNG door sentinel bullshit.

[0:35:51] <%President_Miyazaki> You're gonna ban Ssaryn?
[0:35:51] <%goose_attack_almanac> no guys shut up
[0:35:53] <chambatron> Ban Destiny 2 from your channel
[0:35:53] <+TheStarvingGood> but its the best RPG everrrr
[0:35:53] <%Shadowthedigger> You're saying we can get SSaryn banned from chat?
[0:35:55] <ScreamLord> WTF is Disco Elysium?
[0:35:56] <IndoorSitup> wtf is that game anyway?
[0:35:57] <%arcaderabbit48> The fuck is Disco Elysium?
[0:35:57] <%LiquidShake83> disco inferno
[0:35:57] <mield916> ban people pat.
[0:36:01] <Scrub_Seeker> @ryome i mean i like halo too :/
[0:36:01] <+krawtch> how do people even get the idea to suggest games to other people
[0:36:01] <%ShockzNDrawe> CRPG that came out recently
[0:36:01] <+cvp5127> cant ban us all
[0:36:02] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Disco Elysium? More like Dis-GO AWAY. apatDab
[0:36:04] <Don_Discovery> the BONE ZONE
[0:36:04] <+djinnJuice> the real difference between d2 and warframe pve is that warframe doesn't let you use your godlike endgame mods to clown on people using whatever disparate shit you've been picking up along the way
[0:36:06] <joylent_blue> LUL
[0:36:08] <Ion_Laser> :D
[0:36:10] <+djinnJuice> er, pvp

[0:36:19] <%blackbaron98> apatSmug
[0:36:20] <%ShogunNoonto> she already whated to fuck them
[0:36:21] <+krawtch> do people not know that suggesting media content to other people will likely just make that person want to avoid it more
[0:36:21] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> The ripples of that are felt to this day
[0:36:21] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Why don't you stream Fortnite Chapter 2 or Disco Elysium all the time
[0:36:22] <majindusto> What about Deltarune tho?
[0:36:23] <evilthecat17> Have you heard of this game called mario? pretty neat platforming series
[0:36:24] <%Quigsies> Don't push your fetishes onto us!
[0:36:24] <%miguelrod777> she wanted to fuck skeleton s before it just reaveled it
[0:36:28] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you mean MURDER COMPLETELY FRIENDLY skeletons, right? Kappa
[0:36:36] <%ShockzNDrawe> Why do ONLY LEGENDARIES have random rolls
[0:36:40] <%ShockzNDrawe> it's so stupid I hate it
[0:36:44] <%valriot> @angriestpat I know for a fact, people ignore PvP until IB then just stack up using whatever's broken at the time due to the light level imbalance and stack with 3-5 other people
[0:36:47] <+LeonPup> @AngriestPat any chance we can get Paige to play Kindergarten or Kindergarten 2?
[0:36:54] <%ryome> @scrub_seeker I was being dismissive, but more people who liked Halo’s pvp and just eat it
[0:36:54] <mayorrev> fortnite is popping off tbh
[0:36:57] <%dekkitout> @ShockzNDrawe They used to be fixed
[0:36:58] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat What in Gof's green Earth is Disco Elysium?
[0:36:59] <%dekkitout> AND IT SUCKED
[0:37:00] <mayorrev> looks beautiful
[0:37:01] <%QueequegTheater> @Scrub_Seeker Shooter PvP is bad in 3rd person, Destiny is 1st person
[0:37:01] <chambatron> Hey @AngriestPat Bungie holds an annual event yearly for Destiny. ever considered goint to the event perhap?

[0:39:28] <+Squdnate> @AngriestPat Hey Pat. I just started getting really into Destiny 2, after getting the game over a year ago on Battlnet because a friend wanted me to start playing, but couldn't get into it at that time. Played through vanilla, and the two first expec. Should I get Forsaken, or just skip right into Shadowkeep?
[0:39:28] <IndoorSitup> @angriestpat Any reason in particular you play a Warlock nerd over the other two classes?
[0:39:29] <%some_sunflowers> some_sunflowers subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! Pat. I'm not going to lie. I haven't seen our sub baby in months. It could be anywhere. Be anything.
[0:39:31] <%TimetodiveLTX> "get on point stoopid" - Heavy, TF2
[0:39:44] <%QueequegTheater> @IndoorSitup they're cooler
[0:39:49] <%depressed_skeleton> Wizards ARE cool
[0:39:51] <haisho> but
[0:39:55] <%Rumbutt> Warlock jump is best jump
[0:39:55] <%dekkitout> 🌈 Magic ✨
[0:39:56] <%Quigsies> Good reason
[0:39:57] <zamzoph> MAGIC SUCKS
[0:39:58] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Wizards are from the moon tho
[0:39:59] <Monkeyweed21> Is that fucking jade rabbit?
[0:40:00] <ZeroRagnarok360> @ZeroRagnarok360 is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[0:40:01] <%ShogunNoonto> warlock not wizard
[0:40:03] <%HiroTSK5> Is there any melee weapons in Destiny 2?
[0:40:04] <%DedlokPM> Because Pat is a wizard from the moon
[0:40:04] <haisho> by that logic you'd be playing BLM in FF13
[0:40:06] <Ion_Laser> Being a Space Wizard makes them real cool
[0:40:06] <haisho> err 14
[0:40:11] <%RushUnplugged> imagine having a choice between a wizard and TWO LOSERS and picking anything else
[0:40:16] <IndoorSitup> They don't get sweet ass sets of space armor like the Titan master class
[0:40:20] <Zereaux> ME BIG TITAN ME BIG STRONG ME USE BIGGEST SHEILD. sorry had to let that out
[0:40:21] <%Rumbutt> @HiroTSK5 There are swords, yes
[0:40:23] <JudgeParadox> dad is quantum
[0:40:26] <Bailey__gaming> Hi all
[0:40:27] <%depressed_skeleton> imagine not being able to use magic, haha
[0:40:30] <%Kiiper> @Squdnate Forsaken has more content, shadowkeep is current, both add up to 60
[0:40:33] <%ryome> Imagine choosing to be a nerd
[0:40:34] <%LiquidShake83> nice
[0:40:36] <%QueequegTheater> @IndoorSitup Titan armor is 40K ripoff armor but way shittier
[0:40:42] <joylent_blue> SPACE wizards are cool, old school wizards are dorks
[0:40:42] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Lemonade just makes me think of Yiik now
[0:41:04] <%LiquidShake83> pat carrying?
[0:41:05] <Monkeyweed21> nothing is stronger than a wizard with a GUN
[0:41:07] <%Roasted_Pheasant> "Look out it's a GOLDEN ALPACA"
[0:41:13] <%ryome> Lol
[0:41:14] <%JJnAJjohnson> THAT HEADSHOT
[0:41:21] <IndoorSitup> But we're all in agreement that the real loser nerds are Hunter's right?
[0:41:22] <%HiroTSK5> Great, someday I may play this game and Kirito my way through this FPS
[0:41:30] <Monkeyweed21> if youre gonna use a scout use MIDA
[0:41:32] <%VirtuaRailith> It's weird that this halo looking pvp is what makes me sorta want to play destiny
[0:41:36] <+D00msDayDan> we need a ritual sword
[0:41:37] <fatally_furious> @IndoorSitup yep
[0:41:40] <%depressed_skeleton> at least it isn't a fusion rifle on this map
[0:41:42] <Zereaux> hunters are wanna be cayde-6's
[0:41:42] <%JJnAJjohnson> jesus
[0:41:49] <Monkeyweed21> Jade rabbit is maybe the worst exotic in the game
[0:41:58] <joylent_blue> LUL the ragdolls get me every time
[0:41:59] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Time to kill is too low, imo
[0:41:59] <chambatron> that shotgun is so much bullshit wow
[0:42:03] <%dekkitout> A slug shotgun with high impact reserves and full auto is the stuff of my dreams
[0:42:08] <%Kiiper> Jade rabbit is terrible
[0:42:13] <%JJnAJjohnson> @Monkeyweed21 whats it do even?
[0:42:14] <%Iccirrus> mida is definitely better
[0:42:16] <%Kiiper> MIDA FOR SURE
[0:42:17] <%Iccirrus> It's what I'm usiing
[0:42:19] <%LiquidShake83> mida = apatBig
[0:42:24] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> you're probably better off with Mida, far more forgiving
[0:42:29] <%President_Miyazaki> Mida is better, also do you not have Polaris Lance?
[0:42:29] <Drunkengen> MIDA = Top Tier
[0:42:30] <Monkeyweed21> @JJnAJjohnson stronger headshots for every body shot
[0:42:32] <%dekkitout> More like Murda Multi Tool
[0:42:42] <%RubberFistFight> Pat you keep getting twatted by those guys, maybe you should stop that Kappa
[0:42:45] <%JJnAJjohnson> @Monkeyweed21 so stronger headseeker?
[0:42:50] <%JJnAJjohnson> or same?
[0:42:51] <ScreamLord> MIDA was fucking busted stupid good in D1
[0:42:52] <keiji_maede> Don't you hate PvP, Pat?
[0:42:55] <Ultimatefool> Pat any tips for raising light level? Been stuck in mid 30s this whole week
[0:43:00] <Monkeyweed21> @JJnAJjohnson on a gun thats supposed to kill in 1 or 2 shots
[0:43:08] <QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat So in Destiny 1, Warlocks had an install super that gave them super fast ability regen, but if you used it after death, it was a self-res. They also had a class-exclusive scout rifle called the Tlaloc, which had the perk of doubling reload speed and fire rate and cutting recoil in half whenever your super meter was full. I want that gun back dammit.
[0:43:12] <%JJnAJjohnson> yeah thats a waste of a trait
[0:43:25] <zamzoph> "rewards"
[0:43:26] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> destiny s pvp is fucking unbalanced garbage
[0:43:27] <%dekkitout> Radiance was top tier bullshit
[0:43:27] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> 4 tap headshot for the kill
[0:43:29] <%ShineTheDiamond> There's a separate item manager from the game?
[0:43:31] <%LiquidShake83> yeah
[0:43:35] <fatally_furious> LUL
[0:43:36] <%LiquidShake83> gettem
[0:43:37] <Ion_Laser> PogChamp
[0:43:38] <%ShineTheDiamond> Interesting.
[0:43:39] <JoshTheFace> PogChamp
[0:43:41] <+river_city98> nice :)
[0:43:41] <%QueequegTheater> Radiance was the best
[0:43:46] <spiegspikel> PogChamp
[0:43:51] <%dekkitout> Imagine if Mercy from OW had Reaper's current killing potential
[0:43:56] <%LiquidShake83> wow
[0:43:57] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat oh your going for Randys good luck! P.S. what shotty is that?
[0:43:58] <joylent_blue> good trade
[0:44:05] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Notbad.jpg
[0:44:06] <%dekkitout> That's Radiance- and it was nightmare fuel
[0:44:08] <%JJnAJjohnson> nice
[0:44:08] <keiji_maede> Good shit there
[0:44:11] <spiegspikel> Imagine if Macy was in a good game.
[0:44:12] <%RubberFistFight> jesus christ, for a Witcher, Geralt really can't hold his booze. You'd think chugging all those super-toxic potions all the time would leave him practically immune, but nope.
[0:44:15] <IndoorSitup> I decided to permanently quit from Destiny PvP since Destiny 1
[0:44:16] <%king_wragles> @Bailey__gaming Chaperone I think
[0:44:17] <%3Xgilly> Internet working better?
[0:44:18] <Monkeyweed21> Use MIDA with a good Calus Mini-tool to REALLY WRECK
[0:44:37] <%JJnAJjohnson> oof
[0:44:40] <%QueequegTheater> Radiance + Tlaloc was the meta
[0:44:46] <Don_Discovery> I'd be down to do some Menagire with you pat
[0:44:49] <Monkeyweed21> MENAGERIE WEAPONS ARE REALLY GOOD
[0:44:51] <%TimetodiveLTX> that guy low profiled you
[0:44:54] <%LiquidShake83> that was lame
[0:44:55] <Spiderfacev> whats good pat, chat
[0:44:57] <fatally_furious> melee is controller player poison and it's great

[0:45:49] <Monkeyweed21> Kindled Orchid is still really good
[0:45:58] <Bailey__gaming> @king_wragles chappy is primary & exotic so he can not use it at same time as mida
[0:46:00] <%Fadedblank247> I bought a few Pat shirts to give as confusing xmas gifts. When can i look forward to pj pants with your logo, elmo, and legally distinct energy drink cans on them? The market demands it

[0:46:47] <IndoorSitup> THERE HAVE TO BE DEVS WATCHING THIS WTF
[0:46:49] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Conglaturation; You have the only Exotic you'll ever use as a Well Warlock ever again
[0:46:50] <%Fadedblank247> nice grats Pat
[0:46:51] <chambatron> BIG NUMBER BIG SHINY BIG YELLOW
[0:46:59] <Scrub_Seeker> btw pat, just so you dont miss it again, another nightwave intermission started in warframe

[0:47:45] <Zereaux> i misheard pat and thought he said fetus protocal
[0:47:49] <+FennecZephyr> I'm just gonna play it on gamepass
[0:47:51] <Gravitus123> wow that roll luck ive never gotten above 58
[0:47:54] <%Posh_Cat> kaoxdHEART <- it’s an emote pat ellaLUL
[0:47:59] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat So you know how you told Woolie the guns are named like swords? The sword names are even better than the guns. The original set of swords in D1 were three exotics that you had to grind planetary materials for over an hour for each, with the names Razelighter, Boltcaster, and Darkdrinker.
[0:48:04] <+ChaosAethr> But FF14 Nier Raid?
[0:48:08] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Blizzard is having a COOL Con this year I hear
[0:48:11] <Monkeyweed21> Warframe is going through a BAD content drought
[0:48:12] <Aydarkzero> Phoneix Protocol is good though LUL
[0:48:15] <%LaughingCatt> Speaking of Warframe, did you see the CHONK Frame?
[0:48:16] <joylent_blue> fetus protocol? death stranding isn't out yet
[0:48:23] <Gravitus123> @AngriestPat warframe is getting a new update this week did you see it
[0:48:24] <FockHead> Wait a sec today is the last day of Iron Banner? Didn't it JUST start??
[0:48:24] <%RubberFistFight> Yeah pat especially since you bought all that FREE REAL ESTATE a little while back and got yelled at for it :P
[0:48:25] <IndoorSitup> @angriestpat Did you ever get that early code for Outer Worlds?
[0:48:36] <joylent_blue> i think he did
[0:48:39] <%QueequegTheater> AND SHAXX STOLE MY SWORD
[0:48:40] <+FennecZephyr> @FockHead It's only a week long
[0:48:42] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You mean Outer Wilds right?
[0:48:43] <%QueequegTheater> THAT THIEF
[0:48:46] <+djinnJuice> I'm excited for new warframe melee and I'm hoping the kuva liches are worthwhile and not just a distraction that gives mastery fodder
[0:48:48] <%dekkitout> Grendel seemed interesting- then I heard the word 'Arbitration' and zoned tf out
[0:48:50] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[0:48:50] <%Roasted_Pheasant> The fires are lit, fam.
[0:48:50] <%LiquidShake83> ohh
[0:48:53] <FockHead> @FennecZephyr Ohh ok. I'm new with D2 so didn't know
[0:48:54] <+ChaosAethr> Baited
[0:48:57] <+djinnJuice> but the new nightwave is really bad
[0:48:58] <+D00msDayDan> get booped
[0:49:02] <fatally_furious> @IndoorSitup after the podcast he called himself out on saying the wrong OW
[0:49:03] <%3Xgilly> MIDA was my favorite pvp gun when D2 came out
[0:49:06] <%LiquidShake83> good ole' peakaboo
[0:49:15] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Only an Idiot would mistake Outer Wilds and Outer Worlds, ESPECIALLY to a Rep of the game
[0:49:15] <%Valdorick> Intermission Nightwave - its just the wolf reward set.
[0:49:17] <+Javaa01> Bwoum/10 play
[0:49:18] <%QueequegTheater> @FockHead It's monthly
[0:49:31] <%ShogunNoonto> ace can do that too
[0:49:37] <%3Xgilly> It was also super easy to obtain
[0:49:40] <%Kirby_Sauce> hunter helm does that for guns
[0:49:43] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> don't be afraid to hip fire that sucker
[0:49:55] <%QueequegTheater> Ace of Spades not being Hunter exclusive just feels wrong to me
[0:49:55] <Bailey__gaming> doesn't mid a have
[0:49:59] <%Kirby_Sauce> i miss third man...
[0:50:00] <%afronooch> pat goin for randy's?
[0:50:02] <+djinnJuice> I really really really hope that DE changes the duplicate rewards to be something else for people that have them
[0:50:04] <Monkeyweed21> Calus mini tool is amazing since it can roll surrounded, threat detector, and multikill clip plus the synergy
[0:50:11] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat How's the interwebs? Also how was your break? :)
[0:50:14] <joylent_blue> don't get killed by KONO PICKLE DIO DA
[0:50:24] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Mmmmm... pickles...
[0:50:26] <%LiquidShake83> use the mouse
[0:50:30] <Bailey__gaming> MID A has 100 aim assist on console lol
[0:50:31] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Outer WORLDS will be a great game by Obsidian and totally unmistakable to any fan
[0:50:34] <+ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat So Hows the Internet so far
[0:50:49] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Just aim with mouse and move with controller 4Head
[0:50:53] <%3Xgilly> Did MIDA ever get modified sense launch? (nerf/buff)
[0:50:56] <%TimetodiveLTX> i really want to live in the woods but i need fast internet
[0:50:56] <+Javaa01> MIDA has weaker aim assist, but WAY stronger bullet magnetism
[0:51:02] <+Johannen> I prefer Vigilance Wing or Crimson myself...burst fire kind of guy
[0:51:03] <%tweedler92> man and here I was using Talons like a scrub
[0:51:03] <%GarbageNirvana> @Breakfast_Megapowers I dunno, nothing's a sure bet anymore. It does look good at least
[0:51:09] <%TimetodiveLTX> well not the woods, somewhere far from the city
[0:51:12] <fatally_furious> wait... is Pat running controller on PC
[0:51:20] <%3Xgilly> Well damn thats wild
[0:51:29] <Gravitus123> @AngriestPat warframes nemesis system is coming out this week
[0:51:32] <%dekkitout> They nerf'd high cal rounds, but that's the closest Mida's been hit
[0:51:35] <%QueequegTheater> @fatally_furious yes
[0:51:37] <+ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat Good ISP's Are Dicks Sometimes
[0:51:43] <chambatron> Pat you should probably use your rift from time to time
[0:51:45] <Monkeyweed21> @fatally_furious yes he is cuz he is the bad
[0:51:45] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @GarbageNirvana I'm making fun of Pat mistaking the game in front of a Rep when asking for the early code
[0:51:47] <fatally_furious> the absolute madlad
[0:51:51] <PkSilent01> What class pat is? Warlock?
[0:51:52] <Dapper_Cactuar> can anyone suggest a good TV for gaming that's $600 or less?
[0:51:57] <%QueequegTheater> @PkSilent01 yes
[0:52:13] <%valriot> Honestly anything in PvP right now, isn't remotely reflective of weapons because IB can't just be a normal PvP mode that's fun
[0:52:14] <%GarbageNirvana> @Breakfast_Megapowers Gotcha, this is what I get for not paying attention
[0:52:19] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I haven't shopped for a tv in over a decade
[0:52:28] <joylent_blue> LUL
[0:52:33] <+djinnJuice> @AngriestPat did you see any of the warframe melee rework phase 2 stuff?
[0:52:36] <IntrepidEye> The multitool is still great huh
[0:52:37] <+Javaa01> You can cancel half of the reload, since if finishes when you slap the new mag in, you don't need to watch the chambering animation
[0:52:41] <ScreamLord> It's cool to see all these old maps brought back for D2
[0:52:50] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @GarbageNirvana attention isn't worth the price anyways
[0:53:04] <%LiquidShake83> yes aim
[0:53:07] <%3Xgilly> LUL
[0:53:11] <%Roasted_Pheasant> It's as simple as gitting gud
[0:53:12] <%LiquidShake83> aim = apatBig
[0:53:14] <joylent_blue> AIMING? who thought of that?
[0:53:15] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> just aim 4Head
[0:53:17] <%Quigsies> LUL
[0:53:17] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Aiming leads to big kills
[0:53:19] <fatally_furious> but he's using controller, he cant aim
[0:53:19] <%dekkitout> Based Jotunn
[0:53:19] <%QueequegTheater> yes
[0:53:21] <%afronooch> yep
[0:53:22] <Monkeyweed21> IT HOMES IN
[0:53:23] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> totally normal
[0:53:23] <chambatron> Yes
[0:53:24] <%dekkitout> It tracks
[0:53:26] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[0:53:26] <keiji_maede> yes
[0:53:26] <%Kirby_Sauce> (yo-tun)
[0:53:27] <%GarbageNirvana> Jotunn some bullshit
[0:53:28] <%afronooch> jotun is easy mode
[0:53:29] <morganagod> yes
[0:53:29] <%Maids4lyfe> jotun tracks
[0:53:29] <%QueequegTheater> Jotunn is fucking bullshit
[0:53:29] <zv1neda> it fucking tracks
[0:53:29] <%vaporousTippler> Apparently it's normal for a lot of guys.
[0:53:31] <+Javaa01> Jötunn has tracking
[0:53:32] <morganagod> it homes
[0:53:33] <+Johannen> Jotun is straith up magnet bs ez mode
[0:53:33] <%LiquidShake83> that thing tracks
[0:53:35] <%valriot> Yes, it's one of the main scrubby cunt weapons
[0:53:35] <+Evitron1> more or less
[0:53:36] <keiji_maede> It fucking traces
[0:53:36] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> it's bs
[0:53:36] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> it's a fucking MONSTER
[0:53:37] <Monkeyweed21> ITS A METROID PRIME CHARGE BEAM
[0:53:38] <zv1neda> YES IT IS
[0:53:41] <%dekkitout> It's a special slot Truth
[0:53:44] <chambatron> Thorn
[0:53:49] <+Evitron1> it's dumb
[0:53:49] <%dekkitout> And it's venom in Gambit
[0:53:51] <Zereaux> @AngriestPat you ever use the pistol drang
[0:53:52] <joylent_blue> he killed kono pickle dio da PogChamp
[0:53:54] <%valriot> Thorn Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:53:54] <spiegspikel> That tracking is nonsense
[0:53:55] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat I'd recommend a black scorpion from Banshie which is a really fast rof also you can weaken them with a fast rof primary and finish with the scout
[0:53:58] <%QueequegTheater> Oh god getting Year 1 flashbacks
[0:53:59] <+ChaosAethr> Love that guys name
[0:54:03] <%depressed_skeleton> arn't we your friend?
[0:54:07] <%mintyrobo> The further out you are, the more time it has to get tracking on you.
[0:54:09] <T_Sasquatch> im gonna type like i know anything about destiny 2 , yea ! shoot !
[0:54:20] <%LiquidShake83> sad face
[0:54:29] <%Roasted_Pheasant> I think two of you ultid right next to each other at the same time
[0:54:31] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Feelsbadman
[0:54:32] <%depressed_skeleton> Pat did it
[0:54:35] <joylent_blue> SICK front flip
[0:54:36] <IndoorSitup> @angriestpat Yo, did you hear that they're dropping the final trailer for Rise of Skywalker tonight?
[0:54:42] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I'm not a friend, I am way more valuable as a paying supporter
[0:54:45] <T_Sasquatch> i refuse to play pvp in a game where the gear you have from pve matters, thats nonsense
[0:54:52] <fatally_furious> who cares man
[0:54:53] <%DedlokPM> "Konno pickle da" mogsShook
[0:54:55] <%valriot> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[0:54:58] <%Quigsies> Time travel?
[0:55:09] <%Deekman> Did you go vote?
[0:55:11] <%VirtuaRailith> I don't think there's time travel in stor wors ;n;
[0:55:12] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> More like Rise of Disneys profit margin
[0:55:18] <%dekkitout> Cut to Mountaintop Recluse dominating the raids
[0:55:23] <%ShogunNoonto> yeah but some pvp gear is the best pve gear
[0:55:23] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> people hate stuff
[0:55:25] <ScreamLord> Always fun when you get double teamed constantly
[0:55:25] <%valriot> More like End of Bad Cash In
[0:55:25] <%Roasted_Pheasant> I hope Rise of Skywalker is good. But I'm almost certain it won't be.
[0:55:27] <Quietshun13> isnt most of the gear normalized tho
[0:55:29] <%QueequegTheater> @T_Sasquatch It only matters in this one mode that's only there one week a month
[0:55:31] <IntrepidEye> its only fun when you have the good shit
[0:55:32] <ActingKing42> @AngriestPat i hope this doesnt bother, but thank you for leaving your Des and DS runs on youtube up
[0:55:36] <joylent_blue> that was a FLAME SWORD
[0:55:38] <ActingKing42> as a group
[0:55:41] <Drunkengen> Like Sweet Business melts
[0:55:42] <%goose_attack_almanac> @VirtuaRailith There was in the Rebels cartoon. They use it to justify saving Ahsoka's life.
[0:55:42] <+firelink_dweller> Eww a fucking red goblin
[0:55:47] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[0:55:47] <%honeyman18> the spider is dead
[0:55:47] <chambatron> Nice
[0:55:51] <%LiquidShake83> @pat whatcha gonna be for halloweeners? David Ca-Ge maybe?
[0:55:52] <%GarbageNirvana> Not like it's pay to win cause you can't buy any of it
[0:55:53] <%Roasted_Pheasant> apatPat
[0:55:55] <+djinnJuice> there's so little reason to play destiny pvp before you're at cap, anything less than that means you're at an immediate disadvantage
[0:55:56] <%dekkitout> Hoe's Mad x20
[0:55:59] <%QueequegTheater> Variks better not be dead
[0:56:00] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Remember when Star Wars was cool? the 70's were CRAZY
[0:56:00] <+Evitron1> DUNK
[0:56:01] <+FennecZephyr> DONT BACK DOWN
[0:56:02] <keiji_maede> Yes
[0:56:06] <+Evitron1> sure does
[0:56:07] <+FennecZephyr> THE NO BACKDOWN
[0:56:08] <sirrice77> yes, its kinda pointless because you already reload fast
[0:56:08] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> that's the only thing the catalyst does, and yes, it's as useless as it sounds
[0:56:09] <BurningLlama777> Hello Pat! I've loved your stuff since Machinimatimes. You're great and I admire your moxie.
[0:56:12] <%dekkitout> Variks is FAR from dead
[0:56:12] <%VirtuaRailith> Star Wars peaked at KotoR
[0:56:12] <%QueequegTheater> Star Wars is still cool
[0:56:16] <%ShockzNDrawe> believe Pat
[0:56:19] <startstoprepeat> do you still have to hit max comp rank for the mida cat
[0:56:22] <keiji_maede> and the fucking gun doesn't need it
[0:56:23] <spiegspikel> Star Wars is dead.
[0:56:24] <Gravitus123> it just hurts both modes since they have to constantly think of balance for the other mode
[0:56:25] <redrins> or get killed
[0:56:26] <%ArcanumMBD> Big Whiffs
[0:56:29] <%MrBorisMakarov> LUL
[0:56:30] <MasterDecoder> Variks is absolutely NOT dead
[0:56:32] <+Evitron1> never fucking drops tho. ive been playing d2 regularly since launch and i still dont have that damn caralyst
[0:56:33] <grayjammer> get kills
[0:56:33] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Disney like to beat dead horses
[0:56:35] <+Evitron1> catalyst
[0:56:37] <+ChaosAethr> Question, does anyone know what the name of the Weapon that shoots a Laser beam is in this game?
[0:56:39] <joylent_blue> you shot the air next to his head real god
[0:56:40] <joylent_blue> good
[0:56:41] <%afronooch> @djinnJuice only in IB. Power doesn't matter in any other pvp mode
[0:56:43] <T_Sasquatch> @QueequegTheater wait im confused, are you saying that there is a mode where the gear doesnt matter ?
[0:56:47] <BurningLlama777> Star Wars is ancient horse dust
[0:56:49] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Star Wars ended at episode 6
[0:56:49] <%RubberFistFight> @T_Sasquatch a system that lets you use PvE acquired gear in PVP works to level the playing field a bit though, so that everyone can have a go if they want.
[0:56:51] <%dekkitout> @ChaosAethr There's like 5 of those now
[0:56:52] <+Javaa01> The Catalyst does give it Outlaw, and it's practically pointless because it's a percentage decrease of the reload time
[0:56:53] <Drunkengen> Divinity?
[0:56:56] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> INVISIBLESSED
[0:57:01] <Monkeyweed21> EDGE TRANSIT YEA
[0:57:03] <ScreamLord> It's Variks' fault Cayde's dead
[0:57:03] <%depressed_skeleton> Praise be the magic!
[0:57:04] <grayjammer> INVISIBLE KILL never saw what he DILL
[0:57:04] <Gravitus123> @AngriestPat have you seen the warframe nemesis system
[0:57:11] <%RubberFistFight> @poohtrailsnailcooch the relevant trope is "Franchise zombie"
[0:57:12] <Monkeyweed21> RAREST DROP IN THE GAME
[0:57:16] <%QueequegTheater> @T_Sasquatch gear level only matters in Iron Banner, every other mode damage is evened out regardless of level
[0:57:31] <+djinnJuice> @afronooch in terms of pure damage numbers, sure. But gear with specific effects/abilities matter a ton in regular pvp too
[0:57:38] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat I recommend a black scorpion from Banshise, also you can weaken with anything then finish off with scout
[0:57:40] <Storm_Samurai> @AngriestPat Which helmet is the cool one you tweeted out for that gear
[0:57:47] <Storm_Samurai> @AngriestPat WIth the horns
[0:57:48] <PkSilent01> So is there a reason to use blue drops even if it has higher Light
[0:57:48] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Imagine if you were walking down the street and saw someone get killed by an invisible man
[0:57:51] <IndoorSitup> NO
[0:57:53] <%ShineTheDiamond> Oh jeeze. Space horses are a thing in Star Wars now.
[0:57:54] <%depressed_skeleton> yesss
[0:57:54] <%ArcanumMBD> Because its an alt Pat
[0:57:56] <%nofestu2> lul
[0:57:56] <%fallen92x> you secretly love st anger don't you pat?
[0:57:57] <joylent_blue> skip ALL the cutscenes
[0:57:57] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat he already did them
[0:57:59] <+ChaosAethr> WHYYYYYYYYYYY
[0:58:01] <IndoorSitup> SO WRONG
[0:58:03] <MasterDecoder> NEVER SKIP
[0:58:04] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> @rubberfistfight Franchise Zombie I'm using this. hope its alright
[0:58:04] <Quietshun13> NOOOOOOO
[0:58:14] <%ShockzNDrawe> it is cool
[0:58:15] <%depressed_skeleton> Horny
[0:58:18] <IndoorSitup> DO NOT DO THAT WHO EVER SAID THAT
[0:58:18] <%ArcanumMBD> Skipping is fine if you've already seen them. Meg's Ultros char is an alt
[0:58:20] <%afronooch> @djinnJuice yeah, but that's not affected by light either. If you have an A+ set from last season, you're probably still killin it with that set this season
[0:58:25] <%honeyman18> horned up
[0:58:29] <Mrthepastyrider> Edelgard's timeskip crown
[0:58:29] <%3Xgilly> I honestly love listening to Pat yell at every single bad armor piece or gun like it has a grudge against you LUL
[0:58:30] <%QueequegTheater> People who think Star Wars is dead seem to be conveniently forgetting that if Star Wars could have been killed the prequels would've done it
[0:58:33] <startstoprepeat> fuck i love dreaming spectrum, makes all your shit look like its made of bone
[0:58:35] <%Maids4lyfe> don't fucking skip the story in shadow bringers wtf
[0:58:40] <%ShockzNDrawe> YES
[0:58:41] <T_Sasquatch> @QueequegTheater well thats new right ? I swear it didn't work like that. so you're saying a white shotgun would do the same damage as a purple one in pvp for other modes ?
[0:58:43] <+cafefunk> @angriestpat when youre suffering from anxiety, what do you do to cope?
[0:58:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> your destiny plane has trees on it
[0:58:48] <%ShockzNDrawe> He's got a minority Gov
[0:58:48] <%ShineTheDiamond> @QueequegTheater Accurate.
[0:58:53] <IndoorSitup> BLACKFACE IS AWESOME
[0:58:54] <gekizenbu> blackface canadia boyz
[0:58:54] <%mintyrobo> BLACK KNEES BOIZ
[0:58:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @QueequegTheater The prequels brought the memes though
[0:59:00] <%honeyman18> oh lawd
[0:59:03] <%ShockzNDrawe> HOW THE FUCK DID HE WIN AGAIN
[0:59:05] <%mh9s> canadians love brownface
[0:59:07] <Drunkengen> YEYE BLACK FAC
[0:59:10] <%waifoong98> PJSalt
[0:59:11] <%goose_attack_almanac> I don't wanna be a charicature agaaain
[0:59:16] <keiji_maede> lol
[0:59:17] <StaticSunrise> it isn't blackface it's style switching
[0:59:17] <%QueequegTheater> @T_Sasquatch If they have different stats they wouldn't, but the MMO level progression damage scaling doesn't matter except in IB
[0:59:18] <%Posh_Cat> The armour ornament on that helmet it pretty good too
[0:59:20] <+djinnJuice> @afronooch that seems fine and all but there's still no way to get pvp meta guns before you're already done with all the other content
[0:59:20] <%dekkitout> I REFUSE to like in a world where Canadian politics is dumber than mine (American)
[0:59:25] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @QueequegTheater I just want an interesting Star Wars movie that makes sense. Y'know?
[0:59:26] <%BlueMoonBlues> weren't canada folk supposed to vote today or something?
[0:59:29] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> beating a dead horse is not me calling starwars dead

[1:00:02] <IntrepidEye> just git gud you coward
[1:00:02] <%faeron93> faeron93 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! wanting to invoke my power as a paying fan to ask if you can call Meg a Dummy for skipping Shadowbringers cutscenes .have fun with the shootbangs
[1:00:05] <+Javaa01> Yeah, with how the bullet magnetism is, you need to shoot for roughly shoulder level for EZ headshots
[1:00:08] <spiegspikel> Shoot them in the dick
[1:00:11] <Angry_Ev1L> if only this people knew that they're loosing to a controller LUL
[1:00:11] <startstoprepeat> what's your gunnora's roll?
[1:00:13] <depressed_skeleton> st1mpeLips st1mpeSpit Hunters
[1:00:22] <%honeyman18> Trudeau's new look
[1:00:25] <IminyourBase> is pat getting worked becuase he's using a controller in a pc shooter?
[1:00:25] <BurningLlama777> i hope in the next star war the people hit each other with the laser swords and the ships go shoot an laser a lot
[1:00:26] <IndoorSitup> Hunters are loser nerds
[1:00:27] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Sir_Gawain_Lotsson subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 13 month streak! Started playing Deep Rock Galactic with the boys and WOW that game is Dwarves. You can even make a Pat Dwarf in it. apatWhat
[1:00:28] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> The election is not Trudeau until the last vote
[1:00:35] <%President_Miyazaki> Vigilance Wing will do that.
[1:00:36] <%mintyrobo> @Angry_Ev1L the biggest oOf
[1:00:40] <startstoprepeat> oh yeah, that ain't bad
[1:00:45] <T_Sasquatch> @QueequegTheater NotLikeThis thats just as bad , thanks for all the answers tho. Still feels horribly unbalanced as a new player
[1:00:48] <keiji_maede> not bad
[1:00:49] <Justinbattleborn> hey guys im late what did i miss?
[1:00:49] <Drunkengen> Vig Wing is pretty great
[1:00:52] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @QueequegTheater Gonna disagree with you on that. Rogue was decent though.
[1:00:55] <frostech8> Doesn't one of the ornaments give a red dot?
[1:00:56] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> I hope in the next star wars they go to a amuse park as a time filler instead of a casino
[1:01:07] <PkSilent01> TFW Outer Worlds is coming out but you still need to finish Iceborn and BL3 :(
[1:01:08] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Amusement *
[1:01:17] <%QueequegTheater> @T_Sasquatch Use the white auto rifle you started with, it's actually better than almost any blue in the game
[1:01:17] <joylent_blue> LUL
[1:01:19] <%king_wragles> @Justinbattleborn a couple guns went "bang boom" but there was this ONE gun that went "boom... bang!"
[1:01:21] <%afronooch> @djinnJuice the meta has been pvp weapons since Black Armory my guy. Recluse, Luna's. Ace isn't but that just required Campaign completion
[1:01:24] <%rytyoung> @angriestpat what exotics should I be aiming to get?
[1:01:24] <BurningLlama777> @poohtrailsnailcooch Can the force sensitive chimney sweeps do a whimsical chimneysweep dance?
[1:01:32] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I hope Star Wars gets a new Loot Crate system for my movie going experience
[1:01:36] <%ShineTheDiamond> @poohtrailsnailcooch Prob won't need it. Hopefully the plot won't need filling
[1:01:43] <%DSD24> Oh is today the last day of iron banner?
[1:01:46] <%President_Miyazaki> Any reason to not put down the rift when you wide around the corner?
[1:01:46] <%afronooch> @djinnJuice I don't think any raid guns have been meta since Y2
[1:01:49] <%QueequegTheater> #BringBackTheTlaloc
[1:01:53] <Mrbaconator> these snapshot sights are you some kind of king of them
[1:01:54] <%dekkitout> May I recommend Lumina SeriousSloth
[1:02:02] <%RubberFistFight> @Breakfast_Megapowers they don't call them that any more, now it's "surprise mechanics"
[1:02:03] <xeros720> get the good one
[1:02:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> Sweet Business is dope. I got it off Xur.
[1:02:08] <%arcaderabbit48> If PVP weapons are the meta, then what's the point of doing content outside of PVP?
[1:02:08] <Spiderfacev> DAYUM
[1:02:08] <BurningLlama777> @Breakfast_Megapowers There are 1,000 different versions of the movie, and 1 of them is really good. You don't know what version your ticket gets you in to see until it's started.
[1:02:10] <%king_wragles> SWEET BUSINESS IS BEST AUTO
[1:02:12] <%GarbageNirvana> Do yourself a favor and bookmark a site called Where Is Xur
[1:02:16] <%mintyrobo> jotunn is seriously nice though, it's practically a rocket launcher that feeds on green ammo
[1:02:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Get exotics every week
[1:02:24] <%mintyrobo> @king_wragles ALSO CORRECT
[1:02:24] <%QueequegTheater> @king_wragles You mean the Khvostok
[1:02:30] <%President_Miyazaki> I forgot they removed the hyper armor during supers so you can actually kill them now.
[1:02:40] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Are melees one hit kills?
[1:02:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> Sweet Business is definitely the best autorifle I've used
[1:02:47] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @RubberFistFight It'll sure surprise me when EA releases a game with no MCT's
[1:02:48] <%President_Miyazaki> Remember with Xur to buy the set ones and THEN the engram.
[1:02:48] <IndoorSitup> I see the shotgun meta is still a thing
[1:02:49] <%QueequegTheater> @King_Wolf_Rigger No, they're two hits
[1:02:52] <T_Sasquatch> I rather lose knowing I suck than lose because someone just has a bit more damage on the same weapon, oh well
[1:02:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> Shreds ERRYTHING
[1:03:01] <%QueequegTheater> So if they have a shotgun you're fucked
[1:03:02] <%king_wragles> @QueequegTheater I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the contiuous gunfire
[1:03:04] <%dekkitout> Buy everything- unless it's Telesto, cause Telesto is forever cursed...
[1:03:13] <%QueequegTheater> Fuck Telesto
[1:03:14] <joylent_blue> LUL
[1:03:17] <zv1neda> wait where does monte carlo drop from then?
[1:03:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> Telesto is bad.
[1:03:27] <Slim_Lipid> Monte Carlo more like Farty Barto
[1:03:28] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @QueequegTheater Okay, cool. ty
[1:03:30] <joylent_blue> jojotunn
[1:03:36] <%dekkitout> Two times it was tied to game breaking exploits
[1:03:37] <cudah> Yeah I had an exotic Yesterday and instead of Monte Carlo I got a friggin Hard Light
[1:03:40] <cudah> fml
[1:03:41] <IndoorSitup> How have they not fixed the shogun meta yet?
[1:03:41] <Slim_Lipid> Aotan
[1:03:47] <%arcaderabbit48> I dont understand why all of the guns have random rolls. You have to get the gun to drop, but also the skills on the gun have to drop just right? That sounds infuriating
[1:03:50] <%ShineTheDiamond> Still too high @AngriestPat

[1:16:00] <xeros720> pat is trying to destroy china with his stand
[1:16:05] <%Faustgesicht> Aiming to high, both figuratively and literally
[1:16:07] <%Valdorick> There's only one man who can stop Tencent... Fiddycent Kappa
[1:16:12] <Angry_Ev1L> most countries are
[1:16:14] <%ShockzNDrawe> would you pat

[1:16:43] <Storm_Samurai> @dekkitout It's pretty cool...and I used an unhackable technology called "a paper ballot" it was really nice
[1:16:43] <ChoculaUltra> you guys think Blizzard is scrambling to add something new to the Blizzcon after all those leaks?
[1:16:44] <%ShineTheDiamond> Oooof. Pat's team is doing a big lose.
[1:16:49] <joylent_blue> just a little bad
[1:16:53] <IminyourBase> JUST CLICK THEIR FOREHEADS 4Head
[1:16:54] <King_Wolf_Rigger> If tencent went to jail, do you think they'd be in for a dime?
[1:16:56] <+CourageTheCat> electoral college be like: *your votes mean nothing*
[1:16:56] <IndoorSitup> THE UNENLIGHTENED MASSES THEY CANNOT MAKE THE JUDGMENT CALL GIVE UP FREE WILL FOREVER
[1:17:02] <%TimetodiveLTX> see me in warsow
[1:17:05] <%Gogogolem> No you're bad because you're you not cause of your equipment
[1:17:05] <MasterDecoder> @misha_kastrilevich How many zones you control determins how many points kils are worth
[1:17:06] <%QueequegTheater> @misha_kastrilevich 1 point for kill, 1 extra point for zone advantage, 2 extra points while in full control
[1:17:08] <Angry_Ev1L> LUL wtf
[1:17:11] <%dekkitout> Word?! Unhackable sounds dummy lit~ SeriousSloth
[1:17:20] <%RubberFistFight> @dekkitout oh it is. I mean, shitheads keep getting voted in, but at least it's actually the fault of complacent idiot boomers here in Australia, instead of a system that is so blatantly broken and corrupt it's reached carttoonish levels of villainy.
[1:17:21] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Pat proves how he can be bad, whether on Mouse or Gamepad Kappa
[1:17:25] <%mintyrobo> If you could gitgud with a stream controller tho...
[1:17:28] <+kinmarik> thanks samurai. hopefully a reasonable winner is chosen
[1:17:31] <karl_rex> The wolf's at ol' Saladin's door
[1:17:31] <+CourageTheCat> foolish, u can just throw a bunch of papers in there when nobody is looking
[1:17:31] <T_Sasquatch> are you bad or are the players you're playing bad 🤔
[1:17:35] <Bailey__gaming> @misha_kastrilevich try to capture 2 out of 3 zones kill dudes basically but this one has bonus mode if u cap all 3
[1:17:36] <+CourageTheCat> Paper election: hacked
[1:17:36] <misha_kastrilevich> Ah, i thought so
[1:17:43] <@SSaryn> Waow

[1:17:44] <+Johannen> Wut a clutch save
[1:17:49] <Angry_Ev1L> weaponized crazy talk... terrifying
[1:17:52] <%dekkitout> Okay, really- is there an idiot race America wasn't invited to or what?
[1:17:52] <%ShineTheDiamond> @RubberFistFight I know exactly what you mean
[1:18:04] <+CourageTheCat> @dekkitout bruh we INVENTED the idiot race

[1:19:04] <Storm_Samurai> Very noice
[1:19:04] <joylent_blue> how did that happen PogChamp
[1:19:04] <Angry_Ev1L> fucking Clap
[1:19:13] <%RubberFistFight> @ShineTheDiamond I love how the US relies on those electronic voting machines that have been proven time and time again to be falsifying votes in certain areas - on top of being obscenely easy to hijack due to lack of security. I mean why change a system that gives you the result you want, right?
[1:19:13] <xeros720> nice recovery
[1:19:13] <%ShineTheDiamond> @TheHeroNobodyNeeded On PC with a controller
[1:19:13] <dcikchocolate> Big wins
[1:19:15] <Angry_Ev1L> good job GUN
[1:19:17] <haisho> dayum turned it around on from a 40 point deficit
[1:19:20] <%Ryallen> I donated like $8 total just to get Pat to say freedom, is StreamLabs broken?
[1:19:20] <fatally_furious> @TheHeroNobodyNeeded PC with controller
[1:19:21] <MasterDecoder> Nice, gg Pat
[1:19:23] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Have you used the Sturm and Drang combo HC/Sidearm at all?
[1:19:24] <IminyourBase> EZ GAME WHEN YOU CLICK THEIR HEADS 4Head
[1:19:26] <IntrepidEye> when you walk into the other team but your whole squad shows up and wrecks their shit
[1:19:36] <crazzmatazz2> oh shit i opened up the can of political worms
[1:19:40] <ChoculaUltra> dismantle anything not 55+.
[1:19:41] <%valriot> It's good, they just need to balance shit that's been a problem for like, 8 months
[1:19:42] <xeros720> this destiny game makes pvp look fun
[1:19:45] <MasterDecoder> Keep both coward
[1:19:45] <%3Xgilly> Pat clean your sparrow
[1:19:47] <%ShineTheDiamond> @RubberFistFight It's like we want Russia to hack into them. Or at least, our sitting president does.
[1:19:49] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight No, shhh. You're letting all the secrets out!
[1:19:51] <haisho> but it got that big brain energy
[1:19:58] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> @ShineTheDiamond @Shotgundam009 @fatally_furious thanks bois
[1:20:05] <IndoorSitup> The theme song for China right now might as well be Collective Consousness at this point
[1:20:11] <%ShineTheDiamond> @TheHeroNobodyNeeded We got you fam
[1:20:18] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger LUL
[1:20:30] <%DedlokPM> @ShineTheDiamond Our sitting president and guy that is in control of letting bills through congress to let go to the president
[1:20:34] <ChoculaUltra> Oh yeah, the Leviathan's Breath quest starts tomorrow too.
[1:20:34] <%QueequegTheater> Not a misspelling--go with Goodyear
[1:20:34] <BurningLlama777> Pat take care of yoself
[1:20:35] <@SSaryn> Too bad any mod you have cant give you a better jump Kappa
[1:20:37] <joylent_blue> we missed you pat BibleThump
[1:20:37] <xeros720> top tires are the only way to go
[1:20:40] <Storm_Samurai> @AngriestPat No worries
[1:20:41] <BurningLlama777> We will wait for Pat
[1:20:41] <%Valdorick> I picked Firestone in the early 00s... I did not pick a top tire.
[1:20:45] <King_Wolf_Rigger> We were gonna abandon, but nobody else was streaming, soooo @AngriestPat
[1:20:49] <%dekkitout> Tires with spinning rims are top tires, change my mind
[1:20:59] <joylent_blue> "be anything" is really foreboding
[1:21:01] <%ShockzNDrawe> Pat you're cool
[1:21:01] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Glad you got everything taken care of Pat
[1:21:02] <xeros720> ahaha, literally barely anyone streams on weeknights
[1:21:04] <IndoorSitup> D:
[1:21:04] <%QueequegTheater> @SSaryn Why would he need one? He's a warlock, they already have the best jump
[1:21:05] <%3Xgilly> No worries! These things happen and are unavoidable sometimes
[1:21:06] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat dude, it's fine. Stuff happens. You needed a break anyway. What the fuck kind of fan would castigate you for a) having to take some "you" time and b) having a problem that's literally out of your control?
[1:21:07] <+Chryses_> Hey @angriestpat you’ve said before you used to be into COD back in the Modern Warfare days, are you going to play the new one?
[1:21:07] <%arcaderabbit48> Elmo ate the stream baby
[1:21:10] <xeros720> pat's niche is pretty good
[1:21:17] <PunishedMercer_> yeah?
[1:21:19] <%valriot> MILPAT
[1:21:22] <%ShineTheDiamond> @DedlokPM Not sure if I'm misreading but I'm not sure what you mean
[1:21:26] <IminyourBase> so what is iron banner and why does it go away?
[1:21:28] <%QueequegTheater> It's almost like the MIDA has been bullshit since Destiny 1 Year 2
[1:21:29] <seycheles> milpat
[1:21:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> Everything's coming on Milhouse
[1:21:32] <@SSaryn> Wow that's very not true you saying that @queequegtheater
[1:21:37] <MasterDecoder> Was that a stroke?
[1:21:41] <crazzmatazz2> hey pat, you still playin the overwatch? got any thoughts on that whole hong kong situation?
[1:21:42] <crazzmatazz2> wait
[1:21:44] <+AnsonSue> ew god why pat?
[1:21:46] <crazzmatazz2> dont answer that
[1:21:49] <+djinnJuice> warlock warp woo
[1:21:50] <King_Wolf_Rigger> CoD BlOps was the greatest naming convention, fight me.
[1:21:54] <Koosahmii> MILPAT
[1:21:55] <zangetsu_114> Ew
[1:21:57] <xeros720> AW had some good multi, needed bigger maps though
[1:21:57] <%dekkitout> Iron Banner is a limited time pvp mode where your big number matters; it also gives stuff that makes your number even bigger
[1:21:58] <%valriot> @iminyourbase Because it's terrible and everyone hates it, but it has more EXP, and gear and weapons
[1:22:04] <IndoorSitup> Modern Warfare? Don't you mean Call of Duty series?
[1:22:05] <+captainbronson3> so he got his internet fixed, hooray
[1:22:12] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat What do you think of all the old Halo games being ported to PC?
[1:22:14] <%QueequegTheater> Modern Warfare had a great campaign. Not as good as WaW but still great
[1:22:17] <haisho> oh noooo
[1:22:20] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> MIDA? Pat must be going for the Randy's Throwing Knife
[1:22:25] <Angry_Ev1L> it's not your fault pat, it's all the bad people's fault kappa
[1:22:29] <ScreamLord> Oof
[1:22:30] <IminyourBase> thank @valriot :D
[1:22:33] <fatally_furious> @ScreamLord Halo Reach on the platform it deserves
[1:22:33] <+CourageTheCat> @AngriestPat wish-ender is super fun
[1:22:34] <jestrfestr> I get no pleasure from the pvp in this game
[1:22:38] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat I like black scorpion from Banshise its fast rof, I also reccomend weakening then finish up with scout
[1:22:41] <%DedlokPM> @ShineTheDiamond Mitch McConnel aka Moscow Mitch. He has like 500 bills that have been passed that are just sitting on his desk. That and has been shooting down every bill that has been made about trying to make the machines more secure/updating them
[1:22:41] <%GarbageNirvana> The Black Armory bow is actually pretty solid
[1:22:42] <joylent_blue> "Guardian McGuardianface"
[1:22:43] <TheWolfDare> No Jade PLZ
[1:22:45] <VynnSarr> I just got hush today, its super fun
[1:22:45] <%dekkitout> Use Le Monarque or Trinity Ghoul for Hush grind
[1:22:46] <%tweedler92> I still need to get medals for Hush
[1:22:54] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @QueequegTheater WaW was a ton of fun, holy cow.
[1:22:55] <%ShineTheDiamond> @ScreamLord I have been under a rock. Thank you for mentioning this!!!!!!!
[1:22:56] <%valriot> @angriestpat Use Le Monarque for Hush, and then just use that instead of Hush
[1:23:00] <zangetsu_114> Well i love MW3 so i cant shit on Cod AW
[1:23:09] <%QueequegTheater> @zangetsu_114 yes you can
[1:23:17] <ChoculaUltra> I don't even know if a controller user could get the MIDA catty on PC. That'd be Destiny Fun Police kind of thing.
[1:23:18] <%QueequegTheater> You got to wear juggernaut armor
[1:23:20] <cudah> Shit I still haven't gotten last word yet
[1:23:20] <nevan0> hawt
[1:23:22] <Angry_Ev1L> I didn't quite like BA bow for some reason... what are good perks for bows?
[1:23:40] <%ShineTheDiamond> @DedlokPM That's what I thought you said but you missed a word I think. Lol. Agreed. Things are a bit fucky in Washington atm
[1:23:41] <IndoorSitup> I want you to put your shotgun in my mouth, Pat
[1:23:48] <%dekkitout> Archers Tempo + pick literally anything that isn't sneak bow
[1:23:52] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I wish Medal of Honour would come back.
[1:23:56] <%RubberFistFight> @ShineTheDiamond yeah, just "a bit" fucky. Kappa
[1:24:03] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Le Monarch and Oathkeeper (Hunter Exotic arms) is a good combo for Bow kills in the Crucible
[1:24:04] <Angry_Ev1L> jesus...
[1:24:04] <Zedaei> ouchy
[1:24:04] <chambatron> wtf
[1:24:05] <%QueequegTheater> WOW
[1:24:06] <@SSaryn> Quick draw is always nice for bows
[1:24:06] <fatally_furious> i worked really well in fact
[1:24:10] <Zebroneath> Nice
[1:24:15] <%arcaderabbit48> Okay just do that again. Like forever
[1:24:19] <IminyourBase> PUT THAT IN THE YT COMP
[1:24:22] <Storm_Samurai> lol Guardian mCGuardianface
[1:24:23] <chambatron> Stay in the irft
[1:24:29] <cudah> OOOOooo Leviathan's Breath tomorrow
[1:24:30] <crazzmatazz2> shiiit
[1:24:30] <%ShineTheDiamond> @RubberFistFight Just a little. Nothing to write home about. Just an impeachment inquery.
[1:24:31] <crazzmatazz2> git em
[1:24:32] <+ozzrabbit> Pat, stop acting like a Monkey and use your primary (For the record, maining your shotgun is called "Apeing")
[1:24:43] <sphereshots12> You sure you're doing pretty good with a shotgun
[1:24:48] <IndoorSitup> Alright I gotta go the fuck to sleep now. Later, skaters.
[1:24:51] <%dekkitout> In all fairness- it's a slug shotgun
[1:24:53] <%faldin> "bang me shaxx daddy"
[1:24:58] <xeros720> just mostly wasted it
[1:24:59] <chambatron> You have 17 shorgun shells
[1:25:00] <%ShockzNDrawe> dude
[1:25:03] <%DedlokPM> "Bang me Shaxx Daddy" mogsShook
[1:25:06] <xeros720> you probably made that dude shit himself though
[1:25:07] <%dekkitout> If anything this man deserves a statue FUNgineer
[1:25:10] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> It nice seeing a streamer play the objective for once lol
[1:25:12] <%mintyrobo> "this is going to be a sweep" apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[1:25:24] <%3Xgilly> Out of curiosity, sense you are full back into this game, do u think Bungie will eventually make a Destiny that only gets updated or is D2 going to be it?
[1:25:30] <%ShockzNDrawe> People keep takling about shaxx and it's fucking me up because I think people are just saying my name weird
[1:25:40] <cudah> I thought throwing knife was energy?
[1:25:54] <fatally_furious> @3Xgilly this f2P destiny is probably the end all be all
[1:25:55] <+ozzrabbit> Maybe don't stand out in the open where everyone can gun you down
[1:25:55] <xeros720> D2 is gonna be around for a bit longer, if they hit some sort of parity like Warframe did, i can see them working on a real sequel
[1:25:58] <@SSaryn> Hey Shaxxz how u doing Kappa
[1:25:58] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat get black scorpion from Banshise with chaperone primary
[1:26:05] <xeros720> hell, they might do a sequel just for the new consoles
[1:26:06] <%ShockzNDrawe> SSaryn I'll kill you
[1:26:10] <fatally_furious> they wanted destiny to be an mmo in the first place
[1:26:10] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight The frustrating thing about living in the states, is exactly what you just said.
[1:26:12] <@SSaryn> PLEASE
[1:26:14] <JonEWorldbeater> Hey @AngriestPat did you catvh Jim Sterling's post-mortem on Anthem?
[1:26:20] <MasterDecoder> @cudah Scout Rifle called Randy's Throwing Knife
[1:26:21] <cudah> @AngriestPat Auto fire scout
[1:26:22] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> D2 is a good game, real big Dreamcast Classic
[1:26:22] <%ShockzNDrawe> nah it's weird now you were too into that
[1:26:25] <MrNoobMcSalt> the viest rapid fire
[1:26:27] <%dekkitout> The veist one that's full auto by default
[1:26:29] <%ShockzNDrawe> too egar
[1:26:31] <+ozzrabbit> Black Scorpion is a rapid fire frame Veist scout rifle
[1:26:35] <MasterDecoder> Full Auto Scout @AngriestPat
[1:26:39] <@SSaryn> Damn it ok come to my strem I do instead then tomorrow
[1:26:51] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> Black Scorpion is the Low-Key Meta man
[1:26:55] <+FennecZephyr> Autofire is a waste of a perk most of the time
[1:27:06] <cudah> @AngriestPat If you aim at their chest it can 3 tap
[1:27:12] <+ozzrabbit> Crazy Talk activate
[1:27:15] <%QueequegTheater> Autofire on anything but sidearms or PRs is a waste
[1:27:20] <%ShineTheDiamond> @RubberFistFight Believe me, it's frustrating for those of us living in the US. Our president is beginning to alienate his own party in a big way, not to mention the damage he has done to diplomatic relations across the globe. We are fully aware of how bad we look right now
[1:27:21] <nademonkey1100> personally i love mida
[1:27:32] <%3Xgilly> @fatally_furious I would imagine that would be the case, but what if they wanted to improve certain aspects such as netcode? Could that be fixed with an update?
[1:27:33] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> What is autofire? Extra burn damage to vehicles? Kappa
[1:28:04] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat its a 200ish RoF scout good damage in secondary slot, also u can weaken them and finish off with shouts for randys
[1:28:10] <ChoculaUltra> Bungie needs to bring back No Land Beyond as a Crucible Pinnacle Exotic lol
[1:28:10] <fatally_furious> @3Xgilly probably not unless its a conplete overhaul
[1:28:39] <%QueequegTheater> Can we not talk about trump? I come here to get away from all that
[1:28:42] <ScreamLord> Alwasy reload between encounters
[1:28:45] <xeros720> big fan of dead victories
[1:28:49] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight @ShineTheDiamond At least I know that you can mix gasoline and styrofoam to make ghetto napalm. What people do with that knowledge, I have no part in lol.
[1:28:53] <Monkeyweed21> How far is Pat in Iceborne?
[1:29:03] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Yo, these weapon names are dope

[1:29:14] <%3Xgilly> @fatally_furious thats what I was thinking IF they were thinking of making another Destiny. Ik that Wifi on consoles is sometimes unbearable
[1:29:14] <%ShineTheDiamond> @King_Wolf_Rigger Lol
[1:29:20] <xeros720> nah, pat got a code from capcom, he did one stream, i think
[1:29:44] <%GarbageNirvana> Is that that tactical one
[1:29:45] <%s_xylocalsingles> @AngriestPat Divinity 2.5 2 player co op only, Console only
[1:29:46] <%QueequegTheater> @crazzmatazz2 White whale hunt?
[1:29:49] <%ShineTheDiamond> @RubberFistFight I agree. A few candidates seem to be focusing on policies that would really help a lot of Americans.

[1:31:07] <+Celestian22> i got a sweet wolf. i love it
[1:31:07] <xeros720> elmo screams for freedom
[1:31:08] <%dekkitout> Elmo clearly hates the current pulse rifle meta
[1:31:11] <%Iccirrus> Headseeker is bad
[1:31:11] <%depressed_skeleton> Claws of the wolf is my fav rifle
[1:31:15] <Goergorion> I like my auto-loader and tracking on my roar of the bear
[1:31:17] <%Iccirrus> headseeker is actually the worst
[1:31:29] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> holy
[1:31:30] <jestrfestr> headseeker is ok for controller
[1:31:32] <%afronooch> headseeker is garb
[1:31:33] <+A0N33> They nerfed that, it just speeds up reload speed now
[1:31:35] <+Celestian22> headseekers is like 2 a hit
[1:31:40] <Monkeyweed21> Got any good reckoning weapons @AngriestPat ? I got a last man standing with 1-2 punch and grave robber
[1:31:42] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> Claws of the Wolf Just melts I love it
[1:31:46] <%TheSniperJoe> Snapshot Sights, Rampage on mine.
[1:31:48] <%Iccirrus> I play on controller, headseeker still sucks
[1:31:49] <arkv01> @AngriestPat did you tip the internet plumberman after he rendered... exceptional service
[1:31:49] <%dekkitout> He's using Transversives-not Lunafactions
[1:31:54] <%OctopusLantern> OctopusLantern subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 23 month streak! aaaaaaaa
[1:32:00] <%afronooch> the furnace sounds good
[1:32:05] <%TheSniperJoe> I'm not mad at it.
[1:32:06] <halfnhalf_senpai> why is headseeker bad I thought it was more of a forgiveness perk
[1:32:25] <%Iccirrus> it doesn't make much of a difference at all because the increase is pretty much insignificant
[1:32:29] <Goergorion> Is Pat on console or PC?
[1:32:30] <joylent_blue> uh oh fuckos is back
[1:32:31] <ChoculaUltra> Chattering Bone is still my go to PR, Outbreak puts in work too.
[1:32:37] <%Iccirrus> Pat
[1:32:37] <%QueequegTheater> Turn off OEM pls
[1:32:40] <%Iccirrus> is on PC
[1:32:43] <%Iccirrus> with a controller
[1:32:45] <%TheSniperJoe> I'm a BIG fan of the Moon Grenade Launcher "Love and Death"
[1:32:46] <%afronooch> irc headeeker doesnt really do anything
[1:32:48] <arkv01> man pat sounds like a COD chad when he plays destiny
[1:32:48] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> I ended up getting Headseeker Rangefinder as my best Roll on Claws of the Wolf so far
[1:32:50] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Pat only plays on PC
[1:32:51] <%DedlokPM> @Iccirrus yes
[1:32:57] <ShershaAD> @angriestpat so pat..... i was talking to franz the other day and he thinks im a bigger yakuza fan than you..... thoughts, cause i think its kinda funny.

[1:37:03] <@SSaryn> FUCK
[1:37:03] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> @QueequegTheater you attend the Church of Clemps I see
[1:37:03] <%ShineTheDiamond> @AngriestPat Please pet the baby when you get a break

[1:37:36] <+MosesUnspoken> Hunters have the worst grenades, worst melee, and worst class ability. But we look the best.
[1:37:39] <MarylandJutsu> when is ROAR OF THE ELMO weapon?
[1:37:49] <%DedlokPM> yes. No scoping with a shotgun is so impressive. rooSmug
[1:37:50] <%QueequegTheater> @TheHeroNobodyNeeded Growing up, I liked Carmelita Fox, Lola Bunny, and Rouge the Bat. Somehow I dodged the obvious furry thing going on in favor of liking women who hate me
[1:37:52] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> %-5 Scope
[1:37:55] <BurningLlama777> So are these characters all robots or what? Who built them? Why must they fight?
[1:37:56] <cudah> Worst Grenades for sure
[1:38:01] <cudah> everything is ok
[1:38:04] <Monkeyweed21> @MosesUnspoken Id say warlock are way worse on the melee
[1:38:06] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Noice
[1:38:12] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> @QueequegTheater that was a slippery slope
[1:38:14] <%dekkitout> Spike grenades on bottom tree are pretty brutal though
[1:38:15] <%afronooch> @BurningLlama777 Magic Space Zombies

[1:38:25] <BurningLlama777> @afronooch Ooh, that's pretty neat.
[1:38:28] <%Kirby_Sauce> what is ssaryn mad about?
[1:38:34] <MarylandJutsu> Destiny needs ROAR OF THE ELMO GUN

[1:39:12] <%Kirby_Sauce> so pat then
[1:39:16] <Monkeyweed21> @BurningLlama777 A giant space ball came to earth and started resurrecting the dead and turning them into MMO players
[1:39:20] <%QueequegTheater> @TheHeroNobodyNeeded A slippery slope that I fell off of and landed directly underneath Bayonetta's boot heel
[1:39:36] <%DSD24> Hey guys I just got the Jade Rabbit is it any good?

[1:39:53] <BurningLlama777> @Monkeyweed21 Ooh, that's pretty cool. Not so much on that last part, but... 8)

[1:40:28] <+THEmetallicfloyd> I love that shotgun with snapshot on it. Feels real good
[1:40:29] <%dekkitout> He has literally no choice but
[1:40:30] <Monkeyweed21> Remember its CANON that guardians are loot obsessed wierdos that die for the stupidest reasons
[1:40:31] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> @IminyourBase no its the strong BM
[1:40:34] <IminyourBase> so then why is he using it so close?

[1:42:37] <%QueequegTheater> @crazzmatazz2 It was probably for the politics
[1:42:41] <crazzmatazz2> ohhh
[1:42:43] <%QueequegTheater> Don't talk politics here
[1:42:47] <BurningLlama777> Elmo uses Shout of Hurk
[1:42:50] <crazzmatazz2> not a problem
[1:42:50] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> @DSD24 hella extra stability
[1:42:58] <%dekkitout> Moby Dick is an accursed tome, you see
[1:43:00] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @crazzmatazz2 how dare you? You know the rules about talking about Captain Ahabs adventures
[1:43:00] <%ShineTheDiamond> @crazzmatazz2 We were kinda spamming chat with it a little
[1:43:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> Elmo: FUS RO BLURK!
[1:43:34] <crazzmatazz2> hey as long as i know what it was i have no complaints
[1:43:36] <crazzmatazz2> :D
[1:43:41] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Breakfast_Megapowers We all know Ahab wanted to dump hid paint in that sleek beast.
[1:43:46] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> Anyone like the Talons of the Eagle Scout Rifle?
[1:43:47] <%DSD24> @theheronobodyneeded so I need crucible wins? Got it thanks for the help
[1:43:48] <%QueequegTheater> The guys have spent years being careful not to alienate any particular political side so that everyone feels welcome. We have the same policy on their subreddit
[1:43:57] <crazzmatazz2> is there an ancient conspiracy about ishmael and... METAL GEAR
[1:44:01] <%supercasualboom> I come and I heard an Elmo had enough of Pat and threw up!?!?!?!
[1:44:09] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> @DSD24 got you boo
[1:44:16] <%QueequegTheater> @crazzmatazz2 Moby Dick Ishmael or Bible Ishmael
[1:44:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> I need to do Leviatan eventually.
[1:44:19] <%dekkitout> @crazzmatazz2 That sounds Kojima af
[1:44:20] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Thank god no one talked about Wizard of Oz literature in chat, we'd all get permabanned
[1:44:28] <ScreamLord> Pat's cleaning up Elmo Spew
[1:44:37] <King_Wolf_Rigger> WoO was a trip and a half.
[1:44:49] <%ShineTheDiamond> Hey, sorry for getting political tonight, chat, Pat and mods. I'll be better about not bringing those topics here it in the future.
[1:44:53] <@StridentSong> oh no
[1:44:55] <crazzmatazz2> @dekkitout it technically issssss lmao in MGSV they repeatedly reference it
[1:44:55] <%RubberFistFight> @Breakfast_Megapowers wait why?
[1:44:59] <%QueequegTheater> King's Fall is still the absolute PEAK of Bungie IMO
[1:45:09] <%QueequegTheater> Yes even including Halo 2
[1:45:13] <crazzmatazz2> heyyyy pats back from puke cleaaaan
[1:45:15] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @RubberFistFight Pat is a descendant of the Gump
[1:45:16] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> show us build @AngriestPat
[1:45:16] <King_Wolf_Rigger> stream dying for anyone else or do I need to reload?
[1:45:16] <%NWR_James> Good job Elmo
[1:45:20] <nevan0> yayyy
[1:45:22] <%supercasualboom> Bad Internet, Elmo throwing up...I blame the criticism of Pat on the Magnificent Benefactor of Heaven of China.
[1:45:24] <DracaenaLeaf> Right?
[1:45:26] <%RubberFistFight> @Breakfast_Megapowers LUL
[1:45:26] <joylent_blue> my dog does that too :)
[1:45:26] <%NWR_James> Tile is cold
[1:45:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> Cats are Dragonborn.
[1:45:30] <%Valdorick> Because fuck your plush floor.
[1:45:32] <Slim_Lipid> It reminds them of grass
[1:45:33] <%mintyrobo> Gotta spread the elmo creep. Gives him a 5% bonus to move speed
[1:45:34] <%AgentOrangeShoes> That's every one of my cats. Without fail.
[1:45:34] <redrins> I can confirm my cat used to do that too
[1:45:35] <%dekkitout> I was joking- christ these kinds of super accurate guesses I make are my Stand or some shit
[1:45:38] <%AgentOrangeShoes> It SUCKS
[1:45:39] <halfnhalf_senpai> kings fall is my favorite raid. haven't done any of the d2 ones
[1:45:39] <%waifoong98> so that it stains
[1:45:43] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat He is trying to bury it in the "grass"
[1:45:45] <%ShineTheDiamond> @AngriestPat Bad internet, and cat puke. Are you cursed?
[1:45:47] <%QueequegTheater> I miss being able to customize the character perks
[1:45:53] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Because Cats desire revenge on us
[1:45:55] <crazzmatazz2> @dekkitout whats the name of the stand? dont keep us in suspense forever
[1:46:04] <%LaughingCatt> I don't know, every single cat I've ever had also throws up exclusively on carpet
[1:46:05] <%Ninestempest> but Pat you gotta grind out randy's throwing kniiiiife
[1:46:10] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> what's the legality of my putting The Baz into my game?
[1:46:14] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> you don't like the void subclass? @AngriestPat
[1:46:18] <@StridentSong> The connection is dropping again
[1:46:18] <crazzmatazz2> mine is of course, "Cosmic Debris" of Frakn Zappa fame, where the victim dies from laughing
[1:46:26] <%dekkitout> I don't think it's a stsnd- maybe... a Wound..?
[1:46:31] <crazzmatazz2> ah booo
[1:46:39] <crazzmatazz2> EVERYONE needs a stand
[1:46:42] <crazzmatazz2> your pets need a stand
[1:46:50] <%DedlokPM> Baz was not a finalized concept and is not copyrighted or trademarked
[1:46:50] <ScreamLord> Zubaz belong to no one
[1:46:51] <crazzmatazz2> your inanimate objects ALL NEED A STAND
[1:46:53] <%terminallyCapriciousz> wouldn't it be better to as Woolie about the Baz?
[1:46:53] <@StridentSong> Twitch is reporting 1145 dropped frames
[1:46:53] <%shadyesq> it was for a minute
[1:46:56] <%QueequegTheater> @3Xgilly Fine on my end

[1:47:05] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat no, that's encoder/renderer frame droppnig. Not Internet. Remember the stats pane, it's your friend.
[1:47:09] <MasterDecoder> Got fucky for a sec for me, but fine now
[1:47:14] <CursedNobleman> wait, theres RE4 switch?
[1:47:14] <+Raspada_Ryner> @AngriestPat I've just started scrutinizing my weapons now that a reached 900. Any way to tell which weapon perks are good and which are bad?
[1:47:17] <xeros720> yeah, getting some stuttering too, it isn't too bad yet
[1:47:19] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> [PACKET LOSS REQUIEM]
[1:47:21] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @CursedNobleman Yes
[1:47:22] <%ShineTheDiamond> Everything is good on my end
[1:47:25] <%QueequegTheater> Stormtrance + Arc Warlock gauntlets that gave free Landfall+ Superconductor + Transcendence
[1:47:30] <%QueequegTheater> I miss it
[1:47:30] <crazzmatazz2> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson amazing
[1:47:34] <%Ninestempest> Yeah there was a very small drop for like 10 seconds, nbd
[1:47:44] <xeros720> yeah, seems okay for now
[1:47:44] <CursedNobleman> @Breakfast_Megapowers ive watched playthroughs, but ive actually never played RE4 because im a bitch
[1:47:45] <crazzmatazz2> someone stabbed pats router with the arrow
[1:47:46] <Azathotic> Pat going AFK LUL
[1:47:50] <King_Wolf_Rigger> 2000?! Like, in what fuckin timeframe? lol
[1:47:51] <@StridentSong> It's not nearly as bad as it was before, like this is the first time it happened in the whole stream
[1:47:59] <%QueequegTheater> @crazzmatazz2 Packet Loss Requiem is from the podcast
[1:48:00] <@StridentSong> Well 1269 in the last 5 minutes
[1:48:02] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @CursedNobleman Do it, weakling!
[1:48:16] <crazzmatazz2> fffffffff
[1:48:16] <ScreamLord> Uh Oh

[1:48:32] <haisho> uh oh moar screm
[1:48:40] <crazzmatazz2> REQUIEEEEEM
[1:48:45] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> BABY!
[1:48:47] <BurningLlama777> Elmo Charges: Barf, Again
[1:48:49] <xeros720> you pay your local construction workers yet?
[1:48:57] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> YOU WILL NEVER ARRIVE AT THE ROUTER
[1:49:06] <%ShineTheDiamond> Sorry, Pat.
[1:49:07] <%Faustgesicht> i mean, i cansee you
[1:49:08] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Montreal Mafia hard at work.
[1:49:16] <%BioApple> joke's on you pat ALL isps are garbage
[1:49:23] <%dekkitout> You mean switch to the other option?
[1:49:27] <CursedNobleman> @Breakfast_Megapowers I DIE THE WAY I LIVE SIR. A COWARD
[1:49:29] <%dekkitout> Option as in plural?
[1:49:30] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> "Switch ISPs" Those words. Can you really use them in a sentence together like that?
[1:49:34] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat before you do that - did the internet guy give you any indication what the underlying problem was? If it's an infrastructure/equipment issue, switching won't help, believe me.
[1:49:34] <%dekkitout> *Singular
[1:49:36] <crazzmatazz2> OHHHHHH
[1:49:39] <King_Wolf_Rigger> You're still doing better than Comcast
[1:49:43] <ScreamLord> WHOA, BIG drop!
[1:49:45] <crazzmatazz2> man packet loss req is strong
[1:49:46] <nevan0> oof
[1:49:48] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Fuck Comcast
[1:49:52] <%QueequegTheater> Wait, there is more than one ISP?
[1:49:57] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Freedom from Comcast
[1:50:04] <%ShineTheDiamond> Pat just lost all joy in his voice.
[1:50:13] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Breakfast_Megapowers Agreed. On both accounts.
[1:50:30] <%BioApple> at least the company will have to improve your internet so it's ready for Google Stadia!
[1:50:32] <joylent_blue> as a slave to the comcast gods, fuck comcast
[1:50:34] <crazzmatazz2> @ShineTheDiamond no thats a good thing, now crazy talk cant activate
[1:50:35] <%TaifuDragon> Why has Bell done this
[1:50:38] <%NWR_James> Elmo also emptied the box
[1:50:39] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> i have to use comcast "I have no Other Option" just like A16
[1:50:41] <%Ninestempest> idk i'm not seeing that many more drops
[1:50:43] <%QueequegTheater> @ShineTheDiamond Well yeah, he just realized he's gonna have to go through the fucking nightmare of switching ISPs
[1:50:59] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I'm assuming you're on either cable/HFC or a fiber-based connection? I don't know how Canada's cabling/telephony backbone is set up compared to australias.
[1:51:04] <@StridentSong> You guys can say it's not happening, but I'm looking at the data Twitch is reporting on the stream. It says it's dropping frames. It's almost at 2000
[1:51:06] <%NWR_James> @QueequegTheater that's the true Dark Souls
[1:51:06] <halfnhalf_senpai> that's a big oof
[1:51:11] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Fuck-cast, Cumcast, Comsuck, so many more accurate names they could have taken.
[1:51:15] <%RubberFistFight> @StridentSong nah I'm seeing it too man, don't worry.
[1:51:15] <MasterDecoder> As I'm tempted to ask if just a hiccup, it hiccups more.....
[1:51:17] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Comcast lowers the quality of its ISP to compete with BIG China
[1:51:22] <%ShineTheDiamond> @QueequegTheater Switching ISPs is the worst. I feel his pain
[1:51:22] <%TheHypestCripple> TheHypestCripple subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 23 months! You could almost say that I'm *Destined* for *2* years soon!
[1:51:33] <ScreamLord> Cuntcast
[1:51:34] <%BioApple> Comcpast
[1:51:37] <%NWR_James> That'll teach you for...something
[1:51:42] <%dekkitout> Dumpcast
[1:51:42] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat you have to consider the time of day as well, thought it's weird to imagine THAT much traffic at this time of night
[1:51:49] <%RubberFistFight> @StridentSong hence why I'm trying to get more info out of Pat so I can give him some advices. I used to do ISP tech support, so I'm familiar with faults.
[1:51:59] <crazzmatazz2> hey canada!
[1:52:06] <crazzmatazz2> trudeau is back for more bb
[1:52:07] <joylent_blue> comcapast is good
[1:52:09] <BurningLlama777> Google Stadia is going to do *great,* you guys. C'mon.
[1:52:15] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight but can you make Comcast better?
[1:52:15] <%ShineTheDiamond> Very cool of you @RubberFistFight
[1:52:18] <TofuNyan> @AngriestPat I hope you're feeling well >.< <3
[1:52:21] <BurningLlama777> Thank god Stadia is going to make ComCast clean up their act.
[1:52:23] <%Ninestempest> :(
[1:52:29] <joylent_blue> what a headache for you :(
[1:52:31] <%QueequegTheater> This is why I want to move to a small-medium size town. Big enough to have actual shit to do in town but small enough that the other people don't use all the bandwidth
[1:52:33] <%Ninestempest> Just go for a little bit, we dcan handle a few drops occasionally
[1:52:37] <%RubberFistFight> @ShineTheDiamond I'm a helpful dude, regardless of what some people might try and tell you :P
[1:52:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> Aw. You gitta do what you gotta do though
[1:52:47] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> well this IS a test stream I hope you get it resolved]
[1:52:48] <%Blazymaniac> dealing with isps is the BEST
[1:52:54] <crazzmatazz2> we are ALL helpful in this channel
[1:52:55] <crazzmatazz2> why?
[1:52:57] <%ShineTheDiamond> @RubberFistFight I'll keep that in mind for the future. Lol
[1:52:58] <crazzmatazz2> ....GOOD question
[1:53:03] <%dekkitout> Are you gonna have to fight in a gladiator pits in order to claim your emancipation from the ISP?
[1:53:10] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you familiar with running things like ping tests or traceroutes? They can help nail down whether it's a persistent packet loss problem, or something else.
[1:53:10] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat RubberFistFight used to work ISP tech support, he can help
[1:53:11] <King_Wolf_Rigger> No worries Pat, we'll always come back. Like a bad internet connection.
[1:53:18] <%VirtuaRailith> now it's doing ok?
[1:53:20] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> If Destiny 2 is so good, how come there is no Destiny 2-2?
[1:53:20] <crazzmatazz2> @dekkitout NOW who sounds more kojima? ;)
[1:53:27] <TofuNyan> Do you think you'll play Moons of Madness tomorrow? :3
[1:53:32] <xeros720> it's canada, so i assume he'll just have to endure disgusted looks from french canadians
[1:53:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> I work for an ISP and I'll tell you what, our tech support blows.
[1:53:40] <%Quigsies> It seems fine tho now at least
[1:53:40] <%ShineTheDiamond> @King_Wolf_Rigger Exactly. Or like cat vomit. We will always appear
[1:53:43] <%supercasualboom> Cheer500 Good evening, Pattie Pie. So I just got out work and I came in to hear you had bad Internet and sweet Elmo puke. This is what you get for insulting our magnificent intelligent heroes shining superior heavens lords of China. I’m just downloaded Ninja Saviors aka The Ninjawarriors. What fun nostalgia. Have a good night and may you continue your cursed streak of random clusterfucks.
[1:53:49] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Destiny is Destiny
[1:53:53] <@StridentSong> It was happening on FF7 as well Pat
[1:53:56] <joylent_blue> destiny is destiny
[1:53:58] <@StridentSong> That's when you first started seeing it
[1:54:03] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat your upload would far outstrip what the game needs, it sends very little info.
[1:54:03] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat Pingplotter is a straightforward way to scope out a packet loss problem. It'll let you figure out if it's everything or just one route
[1:54:03] <%NWR_James> Try a different game?
[1:54:10] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @ShineTheDiamond Can't ever stop the cat vomit.
[1:54:21] <%ShineTheDiamond> It never ends!
[1:54:21] <BurningLlama777> See, I avoid this sadness in my own life by assuming that all of my problems are going to last forever. It works great! It works great...
[1:54:22] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> FF7 is a big, graphically intensive game tho
[1:54:29] <%RushUnplugged> Destiny does have problems, I still get constant Cabbage errors from it, but who knows
[1:54:29] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> unlike Destiny
[1:54:36] <crazzmatazz2> ^^
[1:54:42] <+UltraViolet371> Pat I believe in you
[1:54:50] <%Noelle_wasLunaAshford> Look at the da baby
[1:54:51] <crazzmatazz2> hold up your hands
[1:54:52] <%RubberFistFight> @TaifuDragon yeah what he really needs to do is determine if it's a local routing issue or if it's a problem with his physical connection itself.
[1:54:58] <crazzmatazz2> FIGHT THROUGH THE PACKET LOSS REQ
[1:55:08] <+djinnJuice> buncha dropped frames there
[1:55:11] <%afronooch> EMLO
[1:55:16] <ScreamLord> I remember when everyone needed to restring their Guitars
[1:55:17] <xeros720> elmo will save the stream
[1:55:21] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight Could it even be something in his computer?
[1:55:23] <%RushUnplugged> EMLO IS LIFE
[1:55:31] <%supercasualboom> Elmo! Vomit twice if you are in there!!!
[1:55:32] <T_Sasquatch> have yout tried turning it off and on againn ? Kappa
[1:55:32] <%VirtuaRailith> Just get the packets to drop when Elmo is on stream. No one will care
[1:55:32] <%BioApple> elmo requires additional packets per frame
[1:55:33] <xeros720> hmm, like windows update or some nonsense like that?
[1:55:36] <%TaifuDragon> Hardware is not unheard of
[1:55:37] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Taifu seems to know what's up, listen to them
[1:55:48] <%iid970> iid970 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:55:50] <TheHeroAppears> not even negative latency can save us now
[1:55:52] <%TaifuDragon> I run on a tiny rinky-dink ISP that only does university campuses
[1:55:53] <SGrim> Choke
[1:56:01] <%Ninestempest> HOT TRASH LOL
[1:56:07] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger no, that wouldn't show up on Twitch report. Strident also wouldn't be able to see it. What's happening is there's missing information in his stream, but not enough to cause a disconnection - it manifests as the slideshow you see.
[1:56:12] <%NWR_James> HOTRASH
[1:56:14] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Smoking Trash Style!
[1:56:23] <%QueequegTheater> that is the worst Pluperfect roll I've ever seen
[1:56:29] <%supercasualboom> Wait, how long had you your PS4? Since it’s inception?
[1:56:32] <%NWR_James> King of Trash Style
[1:56:42] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight Interesting, okay thanks
[1:56:46] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I offered it last time it happened, but hit me up on Twitter if you want some troubleshooting tips.
[1:56:53] <%UncleAWOL> damn my pluperfect had outlaw and kill clip
[1:57:03] <%ShineTheDiamond> @RubberFistFight I'm not seeing any visual stuttering or any issues with Pat's stream...
[1:57:08] <%Quigsies> Good for most of it tho!
[1:57:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat big sad
[1:57:12] <%ShockzNDrawe> short stream tonight?
[1:57:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> :(
[1:57:20] <crazzmatazz2> @AngriestPat thank you for providing quality content!!! been a huge fan since the machinima days
[1:57:21] <@StridentSong> Streams still fucked Shockz
[1:57:22] <%MisterTylerrr> Sorry your Internet is being fucky man, that sucks
[1:57:22] <+UltraViolet371> Ooh that ship looks like Destiny from Stargate Universe. Coincidence?
[1:57:23] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat it basically lets you toss in URLs and get packet traces for every jump, so you can see really easily where the problem starts to appear
[1:57:26] <MasterDecoder> @ShockzNDrawe Not by much
[1:57:35] <%ShineTheDiamond> No worries, Par
[1:57:37] <%Blazymaniac> @AngriestPat you sure its ISP and not a pc problem dropping frames?
[1:57:40] <%ShineTheDiamond> Pat***
[1:57:41] <%RubberFistFight> @ShineTheDiamond you're not getting the frameloss? Me and Strident can both see it, and Strident and Pat can both see dropped packets on Twitch Inspector, so
[1:57:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> Elmo barfed and broke Pat's internets
[1:57:49] <%hatesdps> he says that and then the screen freezes
[1:57:50] <joylent_blue> good luck pat pvpS
