[0:02:40] <%patriotrenegade> cr1tikal is opening $40,000 of Yu-Gi-Oh cards what is wrong with this man
[0:02:50] <$savagesforblood> @ner234 I'm pretty sure there was only one. and no you'll be fine
[0:02:53] <%MyNameIsRasus> who's ready to get spooped

[0:03:06] <%XeroSigmaPrime> You missed all 8 of the Visage streams?! Youre fucked

[0:03:36] <%MyNameIsRasus> My favorite is Visage 4 when Akiyama gets haunted by the ghost of superchunk
[0:03:46] <%coffeeabomination> @XeroSigmaPrime I actully have infact missed every single one! Excited to catch this one tho
[0:04:05] <elicoy> Oh, is Pat not still subscriber only?
[0:04:08] <%sumrand0> PSA to anyone who's curious:
[0:04:15] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> SPOOPS TIME
[0:04:30] <%floralkami> yeeeeeeeee, I've been waiting for this
[0:04:41] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @coffeeabomination Oh well here, remember that lady with poop in her mouth is the main characters little sister
[0:04:46] <%sumrand0> Xbox cloud streaming via wifi works REALLY well, gave it a try today since I could and it's really responsive
[0:04:50] <%MyNameIsRasus> the only thing scarier than this game is its inventory
[0:04:52] <elicoy> Oh wait that was just VODs I think
[0:04:56] <%Archphronimos> I'm ready to be spook-ed mightily
[0:05:00] <zebexter> King of the Cowards has blessed us with spoopy stream
[0:05:08] <DSD24> Would the inventory be better if it was like RE4s?
[0:05:18] <%MyNameIsRasus> PatScreamsAt
[0:05:22] <DSD24> Attache Cases and shit?
[0:05:50] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Any game would be better if it had RE4's inventory system
[0:05:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Smells like biiiiiiiiiiiiitch
[0:06:01] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Name a game that wouldn't be
[0:06:09] <DSD24> @XeroSigmaPrime That's a good point
[0:06:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Facts
[0:06:16] <%zv1neda> zv1neda subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! How is visage so far? Compared to P.T which one is more terrifying?
[0:06:16] <%MyNameIsRasus> @XeroSigmaPrime Resident Evil 4
[0:06:21] <DSD24> @XeroSigmaPrime Maybe Dark Souls?
[0:06:21] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Damn right
[0:06:28] <%MyNameIsRasus> As it already has the inventory system
[0:06:32] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @mynameisrasus Fuck you got me there
[0:06:32] <devanmuse> Bitch Ninja Ghosts!
[0:06:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PT was less jank
[0:06:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> But its still scary
[0:06:47] <%cvp5127> cvp5127 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! hey pat which game are you enjoying more, yakuza 7 or des remake?
[0:06:48] <DSD24> Oh god I got 5 Estocs I need to fit them with my 20 Crossbows
[0:06:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @dsd24 Nah, would be better
[0:06:55] <%MyNameIsRasus> It's very spoop
[0:07:12] <elicoy> Introducing RE4make with a somehow poorly designed attache case system
[0:07:16] <%Solid_Stro> Time for the spoopy psaWhat
[0:07:27] <DSD24> @elicoy Oooof I don't like that
[0:07:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I'm currently in Chapter 3 of Yakuza 0. Loving it so far. Also both Majima and Ichiban are better MCs than Kiryu
[0:07:57] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Cat meat doesn't taste good, even with MSG. Fun Fact
[0:08:01] <DSD24> Ichiban is such a cool protag
[0:08:23] <elicoy> @BallerSwagBro9k Your first Yakuzie playthrough?
[0:08:23] <DSD24> Its nice to play a RPG with MC that's active and not a silent protag
[0:08:24] <%sumrand0> 5Ghz Wifi connection works for the stream best to be clear, but yeah it's worth messing with if you've got a good phone & controller with Bluetooth. not trying to shill it, just wanted to share that experience since it's cheap and they've recently added Yakuza 0 to their streaming library
[0:08:26] <%Ner234> @XeroSigmaPrime Cat FOOD? or Cat MEAT? monkaS
[0:08:32] <%fritz_dacat> Might kief skit made me feel bad that i still have a ps4
[0:08:48] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @ner234 ... you know damn well what I meant
[0:08:54] <Bazal68k> Pat stares at himself?
[0:08:58] <%Ner234> monkaS
[0:08:59] <%XeroSigmaPrime> hehehe
[0:09:09] <%MyNameIsRasus> dude i bought my ps4 like three years ago
[0:09:13] <%sumrand0> @bazal68k and the Pat stares back
[0:09:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> He's so much better than Kiryu. I like Kiryus stoic badassness but he's such a note protagonist. You always know what he's gonna say or do
[0:09:19] <%MyNameIsRasus> brazil sucks
[0:09:20] <Mrrccava> I cant believe we are getting another Visage stream.
[0:09:21] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Does Pat poop?

[0:33:27] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt I would argue that it's uncontrollable based solely on the fact that "control measures" rely on the good judgement of the population, something that demonstrably doesn't exist at the levels it needs to.
[0:33:28] <%G_Thunders> Anything is uncontrollable when you refuse to control it

[0:34:28] <RubberFistFight> @MyNameIsRasus well i mean, if the "control measure" relies on something that doesn't exist, can it truly be said to be controllable?

[0:38:08] <%DakotaMacDoodle> That sounds right
[0:38:08] <Sapphire_Breeze> AND THEN AGAIN
[0:38:11] <Aydarkzero> c'mon for old times sake Kappa
[0:38:11] <%XeroSigmaPrime> SHUT UP PAT
[0:38:12] <RubberFistFight> Cyberpunk 2077 = Duke Nukem Forever, all over again.
[0:38:13] <HotMafia81> Too much hype to not delay
[0:38:13] <%Nordguy> 2022
[0:38:13] <Reanimator83> Yeah
[0:38:14] <%josstyl_0> yep
[0:38:14] <%Ranryu692> right before the end of the fiscal quarter

[0:38:15] <zebexter> But retail stores have the promotional stuff
[0:38:15] <%BubbaRands> See you in 2022 folks! Kappa
[0:38:16] <+Izzzyko> poland will burn again
[0:38:16] <%Dapper_Cactuar> didn't they remove the release date from the twitter page?
[0:38:17] <%Solid_Stro> I’ll laugh so hard if it does doodLUL
[0:38:17] <%UvBenServed> It'll either be delayed or unplayable day 1
[0:38:18] <@SoFarFetched> yeah 10th
[0:38:19] <%cvp5127> right before fiscal
[0:38:20] <mr_slaide> Just one more big delay, Arthur.
[0:38:21] <AMajorTom> March
[0:38:21] <%logoth_> December 11th yeah fucking right
[0:38:22] <justinjones1989> cyberpunk 2021
[0:38:22] <ScreamLord> 12/10
[0:38:22] <Space_Pagan> Crazy talk activate?
[0:38:23] <%Twin_Hallow> ill bet ya 100$
[0:38:23] <Cerabret100> PoE players gonna have a fucking meltdown if it does
[0:38:23] <$realm_forge> TELL YOUR NUTS TO STFU
[0:38:23] <viciousgrim> f u pat if that. . .
[0:38:25] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> But aren't delays good, because it means they're focusing on making it actually good?
[0:38:26] <HorribleHog> When is the Duke Nukem Forever limit break?
[0:38:28] <ivanmistwalker> 10TH
[0:38:30] <the_Graboid> Pats nuts are always right
[0:38:32] <marrowjuice> Pat, it is mean that I really hope it's going to be bad?
[0:38:35] <theragergamer1177> At that point delay it another year
[0:38:37] <+scrumbotime> I bet it will get delayed until you can actually buy ps5s and xbonxes
[0:38:37] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> 10th
[0:38:37] <%logoth_> It'll get Delayed to September 9th
[0:38:40] <Blank9> but how long until it becomes EALLY playable past release?
[0:38:41] <NitronStreams> "Holiday 2021"
[0:38:41] <%sumrand0> I don't mind waiting for a game that's actually good. better than the annual shit like COD
[0:38:42] <Scorilla> isnt the 10th also the game awards
[0:38:44] <AMajorTom> 1st quarter 2021
[0:38:45] <%Pukenasty> 1st quarter 2021
[0:38:45] <%Ynkubus_> Not Valentines like other games have done?
[0:38:46] <%Twin_Hallow> it wont be unplayable ppl already played it right ?
[0:38:53] <mr_slaide> 1 more delay = Tahiti.
[0:38:55] <Meekest> They meant December 10th of next year Kappa
[0:38:58] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> Pats on record! February 25!
[0:38:59] <%barkon345> who didnt know this was going to happen. people were calling this shit back in January
[0:39:07] <%AFlyingTaco1> Did you see their newest PR stunt to try and distract from their employee crunch?
[0:39:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> They said its getting released no matter what
[0:39:13] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I see that Yellow Screen when I blink
[0:39:16] <RubberFistFight> @marrowjuice I actually hope the game fails, so no I don't think you're being mean. They clearly expect the hype train to never run out of fuel and it's making them arrogant.
[0:39:22] <%ssjklyco> Loves him too much
[0:39:25] <%Monkeyweed21> The dog is trying to fuck him Pat
[0:39:28] <%floralkami> ... sounds like a mistake
[0:39:31] <%barkon345> CD Project Red never release there games on time
[0:39:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NUT UP
[0:39:36] <skeletonknifefight> NUT up and SWALLOW
[0:39:41] <jasnake> Is it unethical to buy the game after all the crunch?
[0:39:42] <Wyldesquirrel> Elmo has big brother syndrome, Gief has lil brother attention needs
[0:39:47] <%BubbaRands> psaPorgmo Usurp the infidel! psaDogchamp
[0:39:48] <RubberFistFight> The missus and I were gonna preorder Cyberpunk but when they started stacking their delays we were like "yeah we're not gonna reward them."
[0:39:51] <+ofloofy> creepy elmo monkaS
[0:39:53] <Meekest> Zangief is the Buzz Lightyear in this
[0:39:55] <%SaiyanShoto> Awww he's jealous
[0:39:57] <Aydarkzero> bed head Kappa
[0:40:04] <+illusiveSaint> elmo was being big salt PJSalt
[0:40:05] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> psaWink psaDogchamp These two are the bestest.
[0:40:11] <%maenos2> doesn't gief try tofuck elmo?
[0:40:16] <DjFrostBite95> LUL
[0:40:18] <%Entroseth> Hungry Blanket sounds like a Silent Hill enemy
[0:40:25] <theragergamer1177> Happy family
[0:40:28] <soraabora> *nods* let them fight
[0:40:29] <%DonFrancisco34> LOL
[0:40:29] <Aydarkzero> it really does
[0:40:32] <RubberFistFight> @jasnake that's something that's entirely personal to you. Some would argue that the crunch would happen either way, and that's a fair point. Unfortunately change will only happen when the people they're exploiting stand up and fight back en masse.
[0:40:38] <$realm_forge> Fuzzy meat armor beast
[0:40:39] <%Broken_Sonex> If it comes out on December I’ll eat my foot
[0:41:00] <%sumrand0> @rubberfistfight that's pretty short sighted, they might crunch like every other company but at least they made an insanely generous game with Witcher 3 the amount of content in that and the DLCs was INSANE the delays are most likely based on making sure it's not a buggy mess like EA games on release
[0:41:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @broken_sonex MESSAGES SAVED
[0:41:22] <%floralkami> kinda weird on the cyberpunk cause it's half "fuck the crunch" but half "damn, all that work and people can't even enjoy the game without that shit taste in their mouth... "
[0:41:22] <%JD_Lars> Make them bathe?
[0:41:22] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[0:41:24] <thelonechris> Oh no
[0:41:24] <blackbookalpha> SICK
[0:41:30] <%cvp5127> lol that game is so broken
[0:41:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:41:32] <valriot> YEAH, SHITSHOW
[0:41:38] <godzookylives> cursed game
[0:41:39] <%DianaTheAscian> oh no...
[0:41:41] <%Twin_Hallow> well it will have bugs prob
[0:41:41] <thelonechris> It's going to be a huge fucking disaster, isn't it?
[0:41:43] <theragergamer1177> Lmao
[0:41:46] <BoneBagMel> witcher 3 launch? yep it was rough
[0:41:48] <mr_slaide> It's going to be a disappointment.
[0:41:49] <$realm_forge> That sounds about right for Xbox
[0:41:51] <Blank9> it's your augmented eyesight glitching
[0:41:52] <%ShineTheDiamond> Yeah
[0:41:58] <%derekwst3> that was 3 months i think
[0:41:58] <RubberFistFight> @sumrand0 short sighted? That's funny. I've been gaming for 3 decades. On the contrary it's an opinion that's been formulated from a LOOOOOOOOT of data and experiences.
[0:41:59] <Aydarkzero> yeah
[0:42:04] <%Twin_Hallow> the witcher had bugs
[0:42:05] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> Cyberpunk is about to be the most painful 6/10
[0:42:05] <%Broken_Sonex> IT'S GONNA FUCKING FLOP, I'LL BET
[0:42:05] <blackbookalpha> Fallout 76 time boys
[0:42:06] <%MyNameIsRasus> i had a friend laugh at me in march when i said i din't think cyberpunk wasnt gonna be goty. boy is there egg on his face now
[0:42:08] <%DappercatEsquire> Cyberpunk 2077 isn't real and never has been, it's a prank
[0:42:08] <HotMafia81> More delay = more crunch
[0:42:08] <Reanimator83> I never was
[0:42:13] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> yes
[0:42:15] <%G_Thunders> All the hype is lost for me now
[0:42:15] <%BoxNavy> hi patrick
[0:42:15] <Aydarkzero> [CRAZY TALK]
[0:42:16] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:42:16] <%ssjklyco> It's going to become a non Bethesda bethesda game
[0:42:18] <%logoth_> Cyberpunk will be the new Duke Nukem Forever
[0:42:21] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Next-gen and PC will be all right previous-gen will be like playing the phantom Pain on the 360 @PatStaresAt
[0:42:22] <%MyNameIsRasus> oops accidental double negative
[0:42:22] <Wyldesquirrel> really think its just lookin like futuristic GTA tbh
[0:42:23] <Meekest> NotLikeThis That would be the worst case
[0:42:24] <theragergamer1177> Lmao yes
[0:42:25] <rytisone> I hope at least it has the mantis arm lady
[0:42:26] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Cyberpunk will be a Skyrim
[0:42:27] <RubberFistFight> oh it's going to be a gigantic fucking trainwreck at launch
[0:42:28] <cybz99> It definitely will be
[0:42:30] <%king_wragles> The game will continue to be delayed until Pat's hype for Cyberpunk improves!
[0:42:30] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I mean it's already gone good and they delayed it
[0:42:32] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:42:33] <Aydarkzero> wasn't ever really excited for cyberpunk tbh
[0:42:34] <%BoxNavy> I JUST GOT HERE AND I CAN TELL THIS IS ABOUT CYBERPUNK
[0:42:35] <%Twin_Hallow> @MyNameIsRasus well gotta wait to actually play it
[0:42:35] <Sapphire_Breeze> HORSE ON THE ROOF
[0:42:36] <%sumrand0> @rubberfistfight so what companies do you root for? who sets good examples in the industry anymore
[0:42:37] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> gold*
[0:42:37] <murdock_465> bbbut keanuv
[0:42:38] <UlriktheSlayer1> yeah even witcher 3 was fucky
[0:42:40] <%kewlmyc> Is it Bethesda levels of bad?
[0:42:41] <%Jack8274> Sup scumbags
[0:42:44] <+GundamF91> The more I see of it the less I actually like what im seeing honestly, the first person gunplay looks lame
[0:42:44] <theragergamer1177> It will be fucked at launch
[0:42:45] <ammobasket> Just play Deus Ex series again
[0:42:45] <%toastybites> Cyberpunk 2077 will specifically set 3080s on fire
[0:42:46] <%BoneofMalkav> It's CDPR Game, It'll more then likely be buggy and glitchy as shit at launch
[0:42:49] <Cerabret100> I've played both witcher 2 and 3 at launch, not great but not explosive
[0:42:50] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> They be buggy
[0:42:51] <%Czar_Kazem> Czar_Kazem subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! hello pat good job keep it up!!!
[0:42:56] <DartonLance> That launch horse in 3 was a treasure
[0:42:57] <%T_Sasquatch> Im really afraid of how the game will run on base ps4
[0:43:00] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> CRUNCH
[0:43:00] <%AFlyingTaco1> Did you see their newest PR stunt?
[0:43:01] <+Helmed> the fact that they removed walking up walls and the little robot shown at e3, it just feels like a big disaster waiting
[0:43:02] <$realm_forge> If it ends up sucking I will laugh my ass off
[0:43:02] <Aydarkzero> nothing can touch the god that is Bethesda glitches
[0:43:03] <%weissguard> Euro Jank is Euro Jank
[0:43:05] <RubberFistFight> @sumrand0 I don't "root for" any of the companies. I stopped doing that a long time ago.
[0:43:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> TIME FOR BITCH
[0:43:08] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I suspect a reason why Cyberpunk keeps getting delayed, or at least part of it, is trying to get it to run on the Xbox One S
[0:43:09] <%BoxNavy> veezaj
[0:43:12] <marrowjuice> bethany esda is a cruel mistress
[0:43:12] <%saadi90> Especially on console
[0:43:13] <%Monkeyweed21> You should replace Visage with Bugsnax @PatStaresAt
[0:43:13] <%MyNameIsRasus> @Twin_Hallow sure, i'll give you that
[0:43:14] <%YakumoYomi> I had no idea Bugsnax was on the EGS
[0:43:16] <%BoxNavy> hi :)
[0:43:17] <%cowardlord> yeah gonna wait for the whatever edition
[0:43:20] <%moogleboy1984> Can someone please explain why the boys keep pronouncing Project as "Proi-yecht"?
[0:43:21] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> Bethesda bad engine buds
[0:43:21] <%Jack8274> Sadly paige can't thank Pat for keeping it up as well Kappa
[0:43:21] <$realm_forge> Bethesda bad is it’s own category
[0:43:22] <murdock_465> bisaguee
[0:43:22] <UlriktheSlayer1> ill take shitty cyberpunk over bethesda shit any day i just want the game at this point even if its a fucking mess

[0:43:25] <%BoneofMalkav> Time for Elgato
[0:43:31] <BoneBagMel> Have people done a compilation of the small pat transformation?
[0:43:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Bugsnax is scarier than this game
[0:43:36] <blackbookalpha> Hope that years-long death crunch was worth it CD Projekt
[0:43:40] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I suspect the reason why Cyberpunk keeps getting delayed, or at least part of it, is trying to get it to run on the Xbox One S
[0:43:40] <commanderapathy> a thousand things have to go wrong before you get bethesda levels of bad
[0:43:40] <%faintsmile> watching this at 2am is really gonna be a bad idea
[0:43:40] <RubberFistFight> @moogleboy1984 because they're polish and i assume that's how a J is pronounced in poland?
[0:43:40] <%Farples> Either I wasn't listening or pat skipped me
[0:43:42] <%leinadtonu> el gato means the cat
[0:43:44] <%Farples> Thas fine tho
[0:43:45] <%AFlyingTaco1> @moogleboy1984 Cuz it's a Swedish company. Or Polish, or something.
[0:43:47] <theragergamer1177> Hype Elgato
[0:43:49] <%sumrand0> @rubberfistfight oh so you're just a nihilist ok good to know we can ignore your opinions since they're all negative then.

[0:53:54] <%JustToWatch> how did they even fit the cabinet through there
[0:53:54] <theragergamer1177> Break it open
[0:54:08] <thelonechris> This house is MC Escher levels of convoluted
[0:54:09] <%T_Sasquatch> REALLY looks like re 7 LUL
[0:54:10] <skyentombment> I understand that you go insane if you're in the dark and a grandma with mental illness killed a baby
[0:54:12] <@SoFarFetched> soon Paige and Pat will shit themselves....at the SAME time.
[0:54:19] <%Ranryu692> even without the reality-warping, this house seems pretty huge
[0:54:19] <BoneBagMel> Sound is kinda fucky no? you take a step left and you only hear your steps on the right ear
[0:54:23] <skyentombment> but who is our character?
[0:54:26] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> go to the uh....panda drawing room? I think I recall? For ch. 1.
[0:54:32] <%MyNameIsRasus> atache doormat
[0:54:34] <%josstyl_0> thank goodness
[0:54:34] <%toastybites> imagine the lightbulb breaks when you drop it LUL
[0:54:35] <rytisone> RE0 main hall
[0:54:36] <jellssssss20> OH is this the PT-alike?
[0:54:39] <%MyNameIsRasus> apache*
[0:54:40] <AngryCaterpillar> This seems to be just a dude walking around his regular ass house replacing a burnt-out bulb while ominous audio cues play
[0:54:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I found a secret tunnel between walls in my old house when I was 3. Got stuck for over 24 hours. No one could hear me till someone used the bathroom next to me. Fuck those spaces
[0:54:44] <%blastyoboots> RE Lobby
[0:54:45] <UndeadManatee> lightbulb zone
[0:54:46] <%BoxNavy> the item rug
[0:54:48] <BoneBagMel> @skyentombment tormented white american man with no preservation instinct
[0:54:49] <natebud> I guarantee you will never need any of that shit
[0:54:50] <+Pinkaminks> I only ever had to replace like 3 lightbulbs in this game
[0:54:51] <Talen99> RE7 really just set the bar for this exact genredidn't it
[0:54:52] <cherubs_anonymous> How long we been in the actual game
[0:54:54] <Zalpar> skyentombment I *think* your character is someone that currently lives in the house, and all other ghosts and characters are previous people living here
[0:54:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> @BoneBagMel are your headphones on right
[0:54:57] <tacoisgoods> isn't this just the RE 0 Inventory system?
[0:54:57] <RubberFistFight> jesus fucking christ this is making me so anxious
[0:54:58] <%king_wragles> If only you had a small arsenal of lighters strangling your inventory to use
[0:55:00] <%toastybites> @AngryCaterpillar does that not happen to you when you replace light bulbs
[0:55:02] <%RobotPancake> so happy he's playing this as I'm big coward
[0:55:08] <@SoFarFetched> Matryoshka
[0:55:15] <%savagesforblood> @patstaresat I think you have garage key bro
[0:55:16] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Evil because its russian jajajajajaja
[0:55:16] <RubberFistFight> oh hey it's a Zalgo Babushka
[0:55:23] <%MyNameIsRasus> Evil matryoshka hall

[0:55:25] <BoneBagMel> @LiquidDinosaur yep. he strafed left and his steps were only on my right ear. pretty weird
[0:55:28] <AngryCaterpillar> @toastybites I only replace lightbulbs in the daytime so the angry nighttime ghosts can't get me
[0:55:34] <%josstyl_0> does your sanity decrease in this mode?
[0:55:34] <%TIME_PUNCHER> I'm listening audio only so I can't see the scary
[0:55:35] <Zalpar> Marge, help, the doll's trying to kill me, and the toaster's been laughing at me!
[0:55:38] <%MyNameIsRasus> we all have the garage key in our heart of hearts
[0:55:42] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> Resident evil doll, aye?
[0:55:47] <Cerabret100> well is garage the same as garage room?

[0:55:50] <%MyNameIsRasus> @TIME_PUNCHER that's tech
[0:56:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> rremember that game on a SHitstorm where there's goblins in your house and you need to light candles to drive them away
[0:56:10] <%MyNameIsRasus> panda deez nuts
[0:56:14] <%Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt girl's room
[0:56:14] <RubberFistFight> @BoneBagMel if he was moving left he'd be constantly moving away from the source of his own footstep sound. Hearing them right-biased when moving left and vice-versa actually makes a lot of sense in a weird way.
[0:56:15] <+Pinkaminks> other child room
[0:56:15] <Cerabret100> isn't there another childs room though?
[0:56:16] <%toastybites> @AngryCaterpillar top 10 tips every housekeeper should know

[0:56:20] <%anubisque> other child
[0:56:21] <skyentombment> @Zalpar so, this whole game is jus the first 15 mins of that show that used to run that was just Pimp My Ride but for houses?
[0:56:22] <Scorilla> @PatStaresAt this is the boys room, look for the girls
[0:56:23] <Noshi1234> other end of the hallway
[0:56:26] <%anubisque> this is the boy's room, you want the girl's

[0:56:57] <%savagesforblood> @patstaresat thanks for playing this I know you dont like these games really. we appreciate it
[0:56:58] <BoneBagMel> @RubberFistFight it makes sense but... at the same time is super weird, its like you threw your foot way out / your head is super off from your center

[0:58:17] <BoneBagMel> It's just like those dark souls games
[0:58:22] <Zalpar> the first thing of Auntie Donna I saw was a clip of you and Paige breaking into the Bikkie song and confusing your chat. Quite like it.

[0:58:51] <@SoFarFetched> @Bluwizard21 Ive answered you multiple times yesterday, it was the DMC5 stream.
[0:58:53] <rytisone> lets hope there are no farting clowns in the basement
[0:58:55] <%MyNameIsRasus> blighttown is just the bathroom
[0:58:59] <%Piemen99> Is that the dog making that noise?
[0:59:12] <Zalpar> RubberFistFight it pops into my head some days at random, and gets stuck. Oddly enjoyable song.

[0:59:27] <natebud> go. do it. go. do it.
[0:59:28] <RubberFistFight> @Zalpar as an aussie, it is particularly funny since the corrupt cop in it is played by a dude who played the police chief in a Aussie show called Blue Heelers, about cops in New South Wales (one of our states).
[0:59:28] <huskarl_zap> its page
[0:59:28] <%Bluwizard21> @SoFarFetched sorry im dual screening and probably missed it since i was just asking pat yesterday

[0:59:39] <%toastybites> can you just leave the house in this game
[0:59:40] <natebud> Just wasting lighter oil as is.
[0:59:40] <%AtomicHeartSon> @Bluwizard21 it was the second half of the most recent DMC5 stream.
[0:59:42] <%beetus_unlimited> Big scares
[0:59:44] <DSD24> Wasn't that RE Composer a fraud?
[0:59:44] <%BoxNavy> pendeh...
[0:59:44] <%DappercatEsquire> Gief could do some good sound work for a horror game
[0:59:44] <skyentombment> Pat using the Woolie tactic of "Darkness=Turn on all the lights in the house", prominently used in Heavy Rain
[0:59:45] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> “I SAID look behind you!”

[1:00:03] <jasnake> OH NO! Not Children!
[1:00:05] <%Captainahab_37> when do you get the ak47
[1:00:06] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> An insidious friend
[1:00:06] <RubberFistFight> that door closing noise cut off oddly
[1:00:08] <rytisone> Potastic Panda
[1:00:08] <%Bluwizard21> Thanks guys, i wasnt looking to the chat to answer mistake on my part
[1:00:24] <%Captainahab_37> is this the game where you dab on your family in the opening
[1:00:35] <Cerabret100> that closet confuses me, that can't be a real thing
[1:00:42] <gustavozxd> LUL
[1:00:43] <%josstyl_0> yeagh
[1:00:44] <DSD24> Dab with a GUN
[1:00:45] <Zalpar> So when he starts a new chapter, will half the doors suddenly lock and all the lights shut off?
[1:00:46] <ChrisM341> LUL LUL LUL

[1:01:00] <%Piemen99> OH BABY A TRIPLE
[1:01:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE ULTIMATE FLEX
[1:01:04] <RubberFistFight> @Zalpar it really is. AFAIK they actually asked him to do it specifically because of his role, and because it was essentially part of Aussie pop culture, more or less.
[1:01:04] <SoySocks> @Cerabret100 sometimes houses have connected rooms between master and a child room, but it's pretty uncommon now
[1:01:07] <%AtomicHeartSon> Having a closet in your daughter's room that connects to the parent's room seems ... real weird to me.
[1:01:10] <huskarl_zap> OH YEAH
[1:01:11] <%Captainahab_37> don't shit!

[1:01:24] <rytisone> cmon Paige
[1:01:25] <%vVAstrAVv> look in closets

[1:02:14] <DSD24> The Lurking Horror
[1:02:21] <skyentombment> I gotta tell ya guys, this is just wonderful for a guy like me that lives in the middle of nowhere and has to traverse the house in darkness constantly
[1:02:21] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> Why is there a clown costume
[1:02:24] <RubberFistFight> @ecoterroricks you must force the yeast to evolve. Like Doomsday from the superman comics.

[1:11:05] <%vVAstrAVv> sounds like bitch talk
[1:11:06] <%Garthunox> Pat the whole game is really good, who told you that?
[1:11:11] <%Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt the fourth chapter is legit good if you dont mind a lot of fetch questing
[1:11:14] <%chiazam> So what now?
[1:11:17] <rytisone> time for clown farts
[1:11:17] <Zalpar> Darn it, no Chapter 3 of Pat's Home for Spooky Roommates?
[1:11:18] <%G_Thunders> 3rd chapter is a worse version of Outlast, but its not bad
[1:11:23] <%Piemen99> What about the signifier? Did he beat that?
[1:11:23] <%leinadtonu> resell the game live on stream
[1:11:24] <+MrBaldachin> @Garthunox i think he means horrible/awful in the spook sense
[1:11:31] <ChrisM341> Chapter 3 wasn't as scary as the first two but it was okay
[1:11:32] <Scorilla> @PatStaresAt the 3rd and 4th chapters arent as scary but still top content
[1:11:33] <+possumwalsh1221> Pat are you a lil spoopyscaredyboy
[1:11:37] <$RealThiele> signifier wont be ebaten on stream
[1:11:39] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Since it's more of a Survival Horror, will you ever take a look at Alien Isolation?
[1:11:41] <+CookieCutter007> LUL
[1:11:42] <%faintsmile> ch3 is at least not as scary as the others
[1:11:42] <RubberFistFight> bahahahaha

[1:11:46] <murdock_465> are you a chicken pat? chirp chirp
[1:11:47] <AngryCaterpillar> @Chatterbox1991 Is it really a fetch quest if you're just walking downstairs?
[1:11:47] <NitronStreams> thats to many photographs
[1:11:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> What? 3 isnt bad, its the worst but its still decent. The 4th is great
[1:11:48] <DSD24> Can't see shit
[1:11:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yes.
[1:11:50] <%MyNameIsRasus> who would layout their house like this
[1:11:51] <%anubisque> The real Demon's Souls starts here.

[1:12:09] <%chiazam> Despite its faults are you enjoying this game?
[1:12:11] <AngryCaterpillar> Yo what were those some cookies on that table
[1:12:14] <%Agami23> im not gonna lie, zangief is scaring the SHIT out of me
[1:12:14] <+possumwalsh1221> Ok yeah that moaning sound is awful
[1:12:14] <%Bluwizard21> has he even seen anything yet?
[1:12:21] <%twoto858> Zangief's snoring makes it way more terrifying
[1:12:24] <+CrimsonAscend> What chapter is he playing?
[1:12:25] <RubberFistFight> wait am I missing something or does this house's layout not make much sense?
[1:12:30] <VritraReiRei> Is that sound coming from the Dog or the game? monkaS
[1:12:34] <natebud> So many lights and you still cant see anything
[1:12:35] <Zalpar> that's a small pet peeve of mine, but if the lights were well-designed then the game wouldn't be hard
[1:12:36] <DSD24> @CrimsonAscend The Lucy Chapter
[1:12:36] <$RealThiele> he saw a lighter, clothes, and a scary picture
[1:12:43] <%Bluwizard21> oh so thats zangeif? i though it was like the moaning in PT
[1:12:44] <Cerabret100> @RubberFistFight no you aren' tmissing anything, its fucking nuts
[1:12:46] <SyLuX45> I think thats the point lol you have to make your own light.
[1:12:46] <Owlboy7> that noise is creepy af
[1:12:48] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @RubberFistFight The house is in fact complete bullshit.
[1:12:49] <murdock_465> Lucy's chapter
[1:12:49] <huskarl_zap> that dog is gonna get woken up so bad when the jump scares com in
[1:12:52] <$cosmicteapots> !uptime
[1:12:52] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 13m.
[1:12:57] <BlkFlameKami> zangief is an scp
[1:12:57] <Reanimator83> Zangief is helping
[1:12:57] <+Pinkaminks> I thought that was some monster growl, is it really the dog?
[1:12:59] <%savagesforblood> so many lights... but can you see why kids love cinnamon toast crunch
[1:12:59] <+possumwalsh1221> WAIT IS THAT SLEEPY PUPPY NOISES OR SCARY GHOST LMAO
[1:13:04] <natebud> Guy should just take a nap and do this during the day
[1:13:05] <%vVAstrAVv> holy shit i never even noticed that light switch
[1:13:05] <+CrimsonAscend> Ah, starting from the beginning. Nice.
[1:13:12] <murdock_465> puppy noises
[1:13:15] <danielm427> nooooo
[1:13:17] <RubberFistFight> @NigelSchnauzerpug I own a house, can confirm, houses are indeed complete bullshit. There's so much they don't tell you about them.
[1:13:22] <+CrimsonAscend> Nooo D: Zangief
[1:13:24] <%king_wragles> @CrimsonAscend this is the second chapter he's started
[1:13:25] <+SwipperSwapper00> is that the dog i thought it was the game
[1:13:28] <rytisone> manly_noises.wav
[1:13:31] <$RealThiele> lucas?
[1:13:31] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Since it might be more your speed, any chance of maybe some Alien Isolation down the road?
[1:13:34] <%leinadtonu> dog's gonna fly
[1:13:45] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @RubberFistFight Like all the ghosts.
[1:13:47] <%Piemen99> WHY ARE THERE SO MANY FUCKING STAIRCASES IN THIS HOUSE
[1:13:50] <%savagesforblood> @nigelschnauzerpug can confirm, I'm the house
[1:13:53] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> too scary 4 Pat
[1:13:54] <UlriktheSlayer1> the xenomorph design in it is good
[1:13:55] <natebud> Check if there's a locker key in that statue
[1:13:55] <valriot> ??
[1:13:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHAT
[1:13:58] <%Taisuru> Minnesota on lockdown again T_T
[1:13:59] <%king_wragles> cause you're very bad at stealth
[1:14:04] <+Scevda> Awww
[1:14:04] <%XeroSigmaPrime> WHAT?!
[1:14:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its so good tho
[1:14:09] <Cerabret100> @Piemen99 you could ask the same question about literally any facet of the house
[1:14:09] <Zalpar> Piemen99 LEG DAY EVERY DAY, YOU STAY ON FLOOR YOU WEAK
[1:14:09] <$KnivesEve> thats why the game has easy mode for pat
[1:14:11] <%ceremight> =(
[1:14:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> has pat shit himself yet?
[1:14:15] <$RealThiele> its also weird that you get guns and bombs that do nothing
[1:14:18] <%ceremight> But the xenomorphs...
[1:14:19] <%blue8moon> pat is notoriously bad at stealth
[1:14:21] <valriot> Game, i think we can boil down most "i didnt enjoy it" as "im bad"
[1:14:22] <ZComiX> Me and my friend fell asleep playing alien isolation
[1:14:23] <cybz99> The impossible geometry of this house is pretty cool
[1:14:34] <%MyNameIsRasus> i miss you hammer chan
[1:14:37] <marrowjuice> I love isolation, but it did start to get tedious near the end
[1:14:38] <SyLuX45> People who don’t like Stealth just means they are horrible at it lol
[1:14:40] <natebud> Don't need any of that
[1:14:41] <Louie_Salmon> The picture?
[1:14:42] <$realm_forge> Hiding under tables and in lockers got too real for pat
[1:14:43] <%josstyl_0> spoopy picture
[1:14:43] <NeroInfinite> That's fair to be honest
[1:14:43] <$RealThiele> strings fuck off
[1:14:46] <+possumwalsh1221> Wait yeah what was the stinger for lmao
[1:14:47] <%DianaTheAscian> somethings moving
[1:14:47] <Parapattern> It's the way the Alien just hangs around certain areas indefinitely
[1:14:48] <+asaoirc> pat confirmed for VamPire
[1:14:54] <%dellakitty> because no reflection
[1:14:54] <RubberFistFight> @NigelSchnauzerpug lol. But no, actually stuff like "hey tree roots grew into your waste main and sucked all the water out of your toilet so now your house is filling with sewer gas and you need someone to come out and cut away part of your path so they can access the main to divert it and put a new pipe in"
[1:14:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> cause evil
[1:14:56] <%Pacifcgrim> @PatStaresAt that noise means something happend
[1:14:57] <Zalpar> RealThiele imagine the secret ending was him sarcastically going "Oh yeah, a gun, real useful, I'll just shoot the ghost" and then it works?
[1:14:57] <%Monkeyweed21> cuz u bitch
[1:14:58] <RubberFistFight> just dumb shit like that.
[1:14:58] <%vVAstrAVv> youll see soon
[1:15:03] <natebud> That sound is a door opening or a light turning off. Weak sanity effects @PatStaresAt

[1:22:55] <+possumwalsh1221> @zalpar 200IQ
[1:22:57] <NeroInfinite> Pat shat himself and we didn't even have a side bet going smh
[1:22:57] <skyentombment> OH MY GOD DID PAT ACTUALLY SHIT HIMSELF?
[1:23:00] <$hooppawesomeness> Paige, just finish the game for him like we all expected
[1:23:22] <Spiralpower1620> I'm back did Pat die yet?
[1:23:22] <+asaoirc> paige cannot she will break her thumbs on the controller

[1:24:08] <Zalpar> oh my god, I've seen this I don't know how many times and just realized what's going on with the mustard
[1:24:17] <jasnake> Is it Geif
[1:24:22] <%Bluwizard21> praise the lemon
[1:24:31] <%BoxNavy> oh theres alittle finch :)
[1:24:32] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt because it broke the tension. You did get a startle though.
[1:24:34] <graeiss> NOT TRUE
[1:24:34] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> relaxed the bowels
[1:24:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat is weird
[1:24:37] <%chiazam> That's fair
[1:24:37] <%T_Sasquatch> That's all horror games
[1:24:40] <Arisato_II> Makes sense
[1:24:40] <%blue8moon> but then it di jump out at you, from a different direction
[1:24:42] <graeiss> JUMPS CAN STILL HAPPEN
[1:24:43] <Tuna_Can_0> at least it wasn't a bear
[1:24:53] <$hooppawesomeness> if you think that Kappa
[1:24:53] <Profmcstevie> If monster in front of me, monster can't be anywhere anymore
[1:24:54] <Jetsfantasy> Pat's butt relaxed, that's for sure
[1:24:55] <%T_Sasquatch> I literally am more scared when there's nothing
[1:24:55] <Scorilla> PSA the menu has a pause button
[1:24:59] <Tuna_Can_0> because then you'd have to deal with a bear
[1:25:00] <Zalpar> No that's normal. I relax when I find out I'm sick, cause a really bad flu isn't like.. small pox
[1:25:04] <mrastro979> What’s your brb song it’s really good
[1:25:05] <natebud> Because the ghost models are scary
[1:25:06] <RubberFistFight> Good horror games know how to build that tension and maintain it for a while, and they know when and how to break it effectively.
[1:25:07] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> The ghost can definitely go through doors so don’t relax too much 😱
[1:25:07] <+possumwalsh1221> Aw I miss condemned bear
[1:25:08] <%UvBenServed> There could be ghost bears, you don't know
[1:25:09] <+gag5y> spooktember never ends here nyahnyahnyah
[1:25:10] <+FeralRageGaming> wait a minute, wasn't that the door from Silent Hill 4?
[1:25:11] <+asaoirc> Play The Long Dark, Paige/Pat!
[1:25:15] <%vVAstrAVv> let him have his false security guys
[1:25:16] <%Agami23> yup
[1:25:16] <%YakumoYomi> Maybe you should have put the "will I shit myself on stream" poll during this stream.
[1:25:18] <Arisato_II> Yes, watch GREED
[1:25:18] <%LouieRouie> ya
[1:25:22] <%Punchasaur> ghost bear
[1:25:22] <RubberFistFight> Especially good games can actually use that breaking of tension to cause it to rebuild again nearly immediately.
[1:25:23] <dirtyh4rr1> gureeeeedo
[1:25:30] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt as far as a variation/extension of a theme PT started, how would you rate this game?
[1:25:33] <$RealThiele> greedo
[1:25:38] <RubberFistFight> then you get games like Dead Space that are uh... not really good horror games.
[1:25:39] <natebud> @FeralRageGaming oh yea, lost of SH imagery

[1:41:01] <graeiss> oh wow right back at it
[1:41:01] <%xemnahort> xemnahort subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months! Hey guys love your stuff please check out a Kickstarter called Romanclevania

[1:41:06] <+michingmallecho> I wish I could play PT again
[1:41:12] <NenaFan101> But, it wouldn't fit in her frame
[1:41:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Thats the problem when your character isnt a "character", you can give up and avoid alot of stress
[1:41:16] <@PlagueOfGripes> the loud noise that never came
[1:41:17] <AngryCaterpillar> Yeah horror games are easily undone by actually losing and understanding the stakes as well as frustrating/unclear gameplay. Seems like you got hit by both
[1:41:17] <%beetus_unlimited> Kick he asss
[1:41:18] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> @patstaresat On the far right there’s a white drawer where the first jumps are happened
[1:41:21] <%Dansen182> The key is in a drawer before you find her
[1:41:32] <graeiss> now run
[1:41:33] <NitronStreams> YEYEYE
[1:41:37] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Silent Hill works so amazing because you know your character and dont wanna give up
[1:41:38] <%BoxNavy> cool :)
[1:41:39] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt this is enforced stealth, sortof, like those moments in Observer
[1:41:40] <Spiralpower1620> "I bet I could kick that kids ass." - Patrick Boivin 2020 slySmug

[1:46:11] <DSD24> I miss Fatal Frame
[1:46:11] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt it's because everyone knows that you can't be killed in a cutscene in a game, so you literally have no tension because there's no risk once control gets taken from you
[1:46:12] <$RealThiele> try using the wiring

[1:47:08] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> You was raised by it. Moulded by it
[1:47:09] <+possumwalsh1221> Oh ok bye
[1:47:09] <%MyNameIsRasus> that scare was super cheap
[1:47:10] <EternalJedi> YOINK
[1:47:11] <$RealThiele> pig bull
[1:47:13] <%UvBenServed> Family reunion
[1:47:13] <Arisato_II> Nooooo my daughter that I don't care about
[1:47:15] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> That didn't look good
[1:47:16] <%MyNameIsRasus> like scream.wav
[1:47:18] <+SwipperSwapper00> why are the tooltips normal but the subtitles are for ants
[1:47:18] <alexandrecau> Kid didn't save me won'T save her
[1:47:19] <SaltyAzteca> I CAN DO IT MYSLF DAD
[1:47:21] <%saadi90> Dope
[1:47:23] <marrowjuice> when will horror devs realize that actually using the word darkness in a spoopy message instantly makes it goofy as shit?
[1:47:31] <%DianaTheAscian> FUCK FUCK FUCK
[1:47:32] <%Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt bathroom sink
[1:47:32] <%TinyLittleDancer> That kid just needed a good home

[1:47:39] <%beetus_unlimited> WHY WOULD ANYONE LIVE HERE
[1:47:39] <Gallhint> If you had to make an original spooky sound, chat, how would you do it?
[1:47:40] <+wizard_of_diamonds> He just wanted to show off his favorite loli don't worry he's going to be preoccupied for at leaast 5 minutes now
[1:47:41] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> ...she dook dis darb?
[1:47:42] <DSD24> @marrowjuice Its either goofy for hype
[1:47:43] <@commanderclaw> That's how chinlets cope, they steal other better chins
[1:47:49] <RubberFistFight> @SwipperSwapper00 Tooltips are a UI element, Subtitles are not. One scales for 4K, the other doesn't. Lots of games have that problem.
[1:47:51] <Sapphire_Breeze> @marrowjuice works for Kingdom Hearts
[1:47:53] <Tuna_Can_0> they got all them teeth and no toothbrush FeelsBadMan
[1:47:59] <$RealThiele> better message would be "IT STALKS ME -> YOU"
[1:48:02] <%Garthunox> Paige would you consider donating your jaw to the less fortunate?
[1:48:02] <%anubisque> Key item in bathroom
[1:48:03] <%saadi90> I blame the schools

[1:48:47] <RubberFistFight> Flash the ghost the marriage tiddy, it'll be impressed and take you as its bride.
[1:48:48] <@commanderclaw> Show the monster your pale orb and blind him
[1:48:49] <%BoxNavy> flash your tits at it

[1:49:04] <%Buzzard42> this kills the pat
[1:49:04] <$RealThiele> reflect light off orb to destroy the ghost
[1:49:05] <%BoxNavy> much like the jaw of the scary ghost in this home
[1:49:05] <devanmuse> how convenient! our ghost is missing a jaw
[1:49:06] <@SoFarFetched> yeah
[1:49:07] <%tank7013> Scared Pat sounds like Vinny doing a bad impression of himself doing an italian voice

[1:49:20] <%ChrisPlaysThing> manequins are a big fing nope
[1:49:21] <SaltyAzteca> So gramma evolved to the Daughter of Aku?
[1:49:22] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Pat needs light
[1:49:33] <RubberFistFight> @ravioli_ronin eh that was a bog-standard jumpscare. Effective, but if they overdo it it'll get old fast.
[1:49:36] <$RealThiele> yea the baby mask makes it less scary agreed
[1:49:38] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Every once in a while I wish someone kicked down a jammed door and just legged it
[1:49:41] <+illusiveSaint> this game is so underwhelming i really wanna see you finish it
[1:49:42] <HotMafia81> All I expect from sinks now are PT fetuses. Anything less is a disappointment
[1:49:44] <%Laecerelius> It’s the poo-poo pee-pee man!
[1:49:46] <%vVAstrAVv> also cool fack if youre unlocky you can see that monster opening the doors of whatever cabinet he spawns from. its a nice touch
[1:49:47] <natebud> just wander around until something happens, again...
[1:49:51] <Sypheck> this ghost roams around so if you hear that ghost rumbling start hauling ass
[1:49:52] <DrStinkers> the new fatal frame looks great

[1:50:18] <+EroHoney> it sounds like Gief sleeping
[1:50:21] <RubberFistFight> @wizard_of_diamonds what I hate is when your character has like 10 things they could use to get through basically any locked/jammed door, but they just stare at it and go NOPE SHIT'S LOCKED
[1:50:23] <%chiazam> AH
[1:50:23] <NenaFan101> "Leave me alone, bull"
[1:50:23] <%heartlesshealer> don't like that

[1:51:02] <$RealThiele> brrrrrrrrrrrr
[1:51:04] <%Minicow1> There were some really bad design decisions in this game
[1:51:06] <+asaoirc> camera is GUN
[1:51:09] <huskarl_zap> hand objects are real ingame objects huh
[1:51:15] <RubberFistFight> the most recent one was VERY good.
[1:51:15] <Goodvibes99508> they are going to start associating geif sleeping with mannequin jumps scares
[1:51:18] <%Minicow1> The spooks are good, but all the item stuff is genuinely terrible
[1:51:21] <devanmuse> What up, demon. It's ya boy
[1:51:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> aw nuts
[1:51:26] <BlkFlameKami> hello demons, it's me, ya boi
[1:51:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> @RubberFistFight at least in silent hill the entire map is a "set" designed to test your soul. here i dont buy the ghosts being able to reinforce doors
[1:51:30] <%Pacifcgrim> candle rooms are safe
[1:51:30] <natebud> Collider . disable
[1:51:33] <huskarl_zap> this is the fun part
[1:51:33] <NeroInfinite> oh the camera hates that
[1:51:34] <%king_wragles> @natebud can't rip off something that never got completed 4head
[1:51:36] <RubberFistFight> @Minicow1 a lot of smaller horror games suffer that problem.
[1:51:36] <NitronStreams> okay this is just the pt hallway
[1:51:42] <@SoFarFetched> This is a weird version of Fatal Frame
[1:51:47] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> Best room
[1:51:48] <%beetus_unlimited> Things have really escalated for Luigi
[1:51:51] <Gorgs7> get a flashbang, and that thing would be gone til next century
[1:51:54] <$RealThiele> portable electric light? heresy
[1:51:58] <NenaFan101> Hey, that looks like the alien baby from Eraserhead
[1:52:02] <Zalpar> LiquidDinosaur you think the ghosts are the ones doing this?
[1:52:04] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> seizure warnings!!!
[1:52:04] <natebud> @king_wragles You're thinking of Silent Hills
[1:52:06] <rytisone> Flashlight would be equivalent of the infinite rocket launcher
[1:52:07] <RubberFistFight> @LiquidDinosaur I mean like when your dude has like a rocket launcher and a plasma cutter and 3 different kinds of grenades, but apparently can't get through a locked door without a key.
[1:52:07] <HotMafia81> Yo that door texture is fucked
[1:52:17] <%Chatterbox1991> dead end

[1:56:35] <%wydamn> ANXIETY GO UP
[1:56:36] <RubberFistFight> I'm starting to think this game isn't going to bring much more to the table, which is sad because it shows promise.
[1:56:37] <natebud> You can brute force this entire game'
[1:56:37] <%Agami23> i also screamed
[1:56:42] <alexandrecau> mortis
[1:56:49] <devanmuse> "You should keep this with you for now" *STAB*

[1:56:59] <%BoxNavy> back into early access with you visage
[1:57:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think Pat is broken.
[1:57:05] <%heartlesshealer> too spoopy for PC
[1:57:06] <%MyNameIsRasus> this game sure could use the ps5 load system™
[1:57:07] <%toastybites> BUGSNAX TIME
[1:57:09] <+Meta1spy51> yikes
[1:57:16] <Sypheck> there's a ghost in the machine
[1:57:16] <%blue8moon> Pretty much the scariest part of this game for me has been looking at someone else and hearing pat scream at a scare
[1:57:17] <%Laecerelius> Game ded
[1:57:17] <$RealThiele> spooked state gone
[1:57:18] <%Ranryu692> Ghostrunner kept crashing in between levels for me
[1:57:20] <%MyNameIsRasus> KINDA BUG KINDA SNACK
[1:57:20] <%chiazam> Yeah what's up with that
[1:57:21] <%Pacifcgrim> is it drivers from the big graphics card?
[1:57:22] <+Pars_Librum> @RubberFistFight Ran into something similar today in Yakuza. Stairs are blocked but if you look behind there is a ladder you can climb the 5 feet up. Instead you have to go to another building.
[1:57:22] <+RowenCleric> it makes death scarier right?
[1:57:25] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> Not cool, game
[1:57:25] <%vVAstrAVv> luckily it autosaves quite frequently
[1:57:26] <+wizard_of_diamonds> WTF
[1:57:27] <RubberFistFight> @MyNameIsRasus i'm actually really impressed with the PS5's load times.
[1:57:27] <NitronStreams> Technical issues are the real horror
[1:57:27] <%Punchasaur> true horror
[1:57:27] <+CrimsonAscend> BugSnax?
[1:57:28] <Gorgs7> PC literally shit itself from fear

[1:58:14] <%BoxNavy> babeuhh
[1:58:16] <%Pacifcgrim> its not that far
[1:58:17] <marrowjuice> it's a huge bummer that horror games are so hard to get quite right
[1:58:18] <%AFlyingTaco1> Woof
[1:58:19] <%G_Thunders> If RE8 has haptic feedback I’m getting a PS5 for sure
[1:58:20] <akitanito> what did I miss

[1:58:47] <NitronStreams> I HATE THIS
[1:58:49] <%chiazam> So where is he supposed to be going?
[1:58:51] <HotMafia81> Leeeeean back
[1:58:52] <RubberFistFight> @Pars_Librum yeah. I get why they do it, but it does sometimes take you out of it a bit. I definitely like games that let you take whatever route you choose to your goal, like true open-world titles, as long as the route is achievable in a "real world" sense.
[1:58:52] <heart_ablaze> that's good
[1:58:57] <+RowenCleric> how many hours a day does Gief snore?
[1:58:58] <%Taisuru> LUL

[1:59:22] <%Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt you an skip the cabnit too
[1:59:22] <%BoxNavy> cannot save when enemies are nearby
[1:59:28] <%MyNameIsRasus> burpies happened
[1:59:37] <heart_ablaze> game play aside, the atmosphere here is fucking incredible
[1:59:39] <Zalpar> You are past redemption.
[1:59:44] <HotMafia81> Bitch clock
[1:59:46] <+MoistBananaPudd> bungotSmolpp
[1:59:48] <RubberFistFight> @BoxNavy it's like Eternal Darkness: You can't save now, The Darkness is coming.
[1:59:53] <huskarl_zap> that room is death
[1:59:53] <%linSP> hey gang is this game scarier than the new amnesia
[1:59:54] <graeiss> run
[2:00:07] <%josstyl_0> just spooky noise i gues
[2:00:10] <HotMafia81> @linSP 200%
[2:00:10] <marrowjuice> why he sound like dinosaur?
[2:00:10] <chambatron> Is that also zangief?
[2:00:12] <%linSP> this is literally the PT hallway
[2:00:13] <Arisato_II> That's a great tactic, sit in a corner and spam flashes
[2:00:17] <young_sn0w> Pat you look scared as shit
[2:00:23] <+illusiveSaint> was it just noise and not a spooky scene?
[2:00:28] <CappuccinoGuil> @linSP yes. New amnesia has a neat story and all, but this is REALLY scary
[2:00:36] <+Pars_Librum> @RubberFistFight Oh, yeah, completely agree. It's a constraint of the game type. Thankfully it doesn't take me out of things too much. I just go "that's silly" and move on.
[2:00:38] <RubberFistFight> @linSP haven't played new amnesia, but this game has potential. Right now it's leaning a little too heavily on jumpscares for my liking though.
[2:00:39] <%Buzzard42> spook
[2:00:40] <natebud> bwump
[2:00:40] <@SoFarFetched> @linSP I would say definitely, new amnesia does it where if you get captured by spooky monster,it just holds your hand to help you go further.
[2:00:44] <huskarl_zap> brass section be like be liek
[2:00:44] <HotMafia81> Is that Paige coughing?

[2:01:19] <%ChrisPlaysThing> LUL
[2:01:20] <ToneBacas> sounds about right

[2:03:01] <$RealThiele> nop
[2:03:02] <%Chatterbox1991> RUG
[2:03:02] <RubberFistFight> @Pars_Librum what i hate is when they do it the way Doom Eternal did it - where Doomguy can TOTALLY punch through walls and shit... as long as they're the "specially marked" one. What would have been better is changing the encounters based on whether you took the direct or indirect route.
[2:03:11] <%juxtest> This guy's parents got free Turok games for life
[2:03:11] <natebud> Bold of you to assume this chapter has puzzles
[2:03:12] <%chiazam> Ah yes this ceiling is floor
[2:03:12] <%josstyl_0> look at rug
[2:03:13] <%Dementedpenguin> Fuck this Johnny Quest monster. WutFace
[2:03:14] <%Agami23> line up the shadows?
[2:03:14] <HotMafia81> FARTY BRASS NO SCARY GAME PLEASE STOP
[2:03:17] <%BinaryFireball> man yo house fucked up

[2:03:28] <Scorilla> RUG
[2:03:30] <%Chatterbox1991> R U G
[2:03:33] <RubberFistFight> Like if you take the "get the key and open the door route" you get Encounter A, but if you take the "Punch the ass out of the door" route you get encounter B.
[2:03:33] <$RealThiele> boo
[2:03:34] <%JustToWatch> RUG
[2:03:38] <Arisato_II> Pat, rug

[2:03:49] <Manwad> this reminds me of that one shower scene in This Book Is Full Of Spiders
[2:03:50] <%chiazam> down we go
[2:03:53] <John_Tsuda> strong rug
[2:04:07] <%Punchasaur> nice physics on the rug
[2:04:10] <%MyNameIsRasus> Just spam the camera always
[2:04:13] <Daxalog> The Shadow Realm
[2:04:14] <natebud> This game has such lazy symbolism
[2:04:16] <%LouieRouie> Gotta love rebar ladders
[2:04:19] <%josstyl_0> ah yes, the eye hol,e
[2:04:20] <%MyNameIsRasus> THIS IS MY HOLE
[2:04:21] <+CrimsonAscend> Glory Hole?
[2:04:21] <HotMafia81> Oooh this is tight

[2:04:27] <%Dementedpenguin> DansGame
[2:04:29] <$RealThiele> sex talk
[2:04:30] <marrowjuice> this game has a lot of design elements that i vibe with

[2:04:32] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:04:33] <%ChrisPlaysThing> screw whatever that was
[2:04:33] <%BoxNavy> oh ok
[2:04:34] <+illusiveSaint> its a SILENT HILL HOLE
[2:04:35] <%Punchasaur> fucked up gloryhole
[2:04:35] <%blue8moon> why did the monster make a scary noise?
[2:04:36] <NitronStreams> look at those low res texture
[2:04:38] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @natebud I find this game kinda lazy in it's scares in general.
[2:04:39] <%johnnysasakistand> johnnysasakistand subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:04:39] <devanmuse> is that the fucking buster sword?
[2:04:40] <%xcompleasedad> Fucking negative textures
[2:04:41] <CappuccinoGuil> lol I thought it was a sword LUL
[2:04:42] <HotMafia81> Very vaginal. So subliminal
[2:04:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Manwad is that worth reading? I only read John Dies at the End and to this day i still occasionally quote "They were at a chinese restaurant owned by these guys who clearly didnt know a whole lot about china. Or about food."
[2:04:45] <%KineKithZen> You saw to the beam in your eye, now see to the mote in his
[2:04:47] <Goodvibes99508> no wait pick it up
[2:04:47] <ToneBacas> the shittiest glory hole
[2:04:48] <+Pars_Librum> @RubberFistFight Yeah, too bad that's extra planning the devs either don't think about or don't do because of the extra time required
[2:04:50] <RubberFistFight> @NigelSchnauzerpug me too, sadly.
[2:04:51] <%juxtest> Big wood in the glory hole
[2:04:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Manwad or "It's okay. We're Elton John."
[2:04:53] <%MyNameIsRasus> That ghost had no jaw tho
[2:04:53] <%daddylongnuts1> daddylongnuts1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! I've almost obtained the baby. next the wolrd
[2:04:56] <%xcompleasedad> SHADOW IS GONE
[2:04:57] <Goodvibes99508> great knife this hitch
[2:05:03] <%Buzzard42> no
[2:05:04] <%BubbaRands> So that's where the Woolie hole's been!
[2:05:04] <%Laecerelius> Eyegina
[2:05:05] <%xemnahort> So camera bad but it’s good with candles if they’re red
[2:05:06] <marrowjuice> clench your asshole
[2:05:07] <Sotetsu> Boo
[2:05:11] <+possumwalsh1221> I hate that nothing happened uhnGiga
[2:05:18] <natebud> @NigelSchnauzerpug Other than the cry of fear camera mechanic, the game really doesn't do anything interesting
[2:05:36] <chambatron> seribeb
[2:05:36] <%Punchasaur> try as you might but you're still gonna shriek when it happens
[2:05:37] <Arisato_II> The weed room
[2:05:38] <Sotetsu> Paige is your mojo made flesh
[2:05:40] <%Buzzard42> weed room
[2:05:41] <%leinadtonu> kick him Paige!

[2:05:45] <%blue8moon> that panda has dead eyes

[2:05:47] <%BoxNavy> smoke all of that weed to progress
[2:05:47] <%Estuko> monkaS
[2:05:48] <Explodincatz> WEED
[2:05:49] <$Afterman_> i like this room
[2:05:50] <BlkFlameKami> BLAZE IT
[2:05:52] <%chiazam> fernssss
[2:05:52] <CappuccinoGuil> It's Mary Joana's room
[2:05:52] <John_Tsuda> Ferns = Frens
[2:05:53] <RubberFistFight> @Pars_Librum honestly i'm starting to wonder if it's less that and more that they're just not thinking about it in the first place. Because a LOT of eternal, especially the DLC, would be easily improved with some relatively minor and OBVIOUS mechanical changes, leading to the question "why didn't they just do that instead?"
[2:05:54] <%MidnightBurst12> spooky
[2:05:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Manwad or when talking to people on discord or messenger or other online things i'll mention hypothetically buying cigarettes for various public figures. hypothetically.
[2:05:55] <Sotetsu> Panda!
[2:05:56] <SaltyAzteca> Gonna take a lot to take me awaaaaay from youuuu!!
[2:05:57] <%derekwst3> time to get high
[2:05:58] <ToneBacas> oh no, scary music
[2:05:58] <Daxalog> Panda WEED

[2:06:10] <%Estuko> JESUS
[2:06:11] <%derekwst3> weed so spooky
[2:06:12] <rjhascancer> in the tiki tiki tiki tiki tiki room
[2:06:13] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @natebud There's no tension in the world, only when the ghost is chasing you, but other than that it's just a weird house.
[2:06:14] <RubberFistFight> That didn't even get me
[2:06:14] <+CrimsonAscend> D:
[2:06:14] <natebud> Good thing you healed LUL
[2:06:20] <RubberFistFight> i'm officially done with this game
[2:06:20] <%Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt ignore side doors
[2:06:21] <%LouieRouie> Looks like the boogeyman is a doobieman
[2:06:22] <Sotetsu> What a helpful ghost
[2:06:23] <huskarl_zap> WEED EVIL
[2:06:23] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Stabby stabby time
[2:06:24] <+TheMorilo> jesus fuck
[2:06:27] <%Piemen99> yo this demon tight as fucj
[2:06:27] <CappuccinoGuil> I think you need 2 pics. So far, 2 pics have spooked him away
[2:06:27] <+blastazoid00> Bad trip
[2:06:28] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt this is some one-trick pony shit, dude.
[2:06:31] <rytisone> Weed too strong
[2:06:31] <+illusiveSaint> OMEGALUL
[2:06:31] <Arisato_II> Too blazed to be scared
[2:06:31] <Archmortal> you aimed at the floor though
[2:06:34] <+Pars_Librum> @RubberFistFight Tunnel vision from their planned vision perhaps
[2:06:34] <%king_wragles> This feels busted
[2:06:37] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> match result: SACRIFICED
[2:06:37] <@SoFarFetched> Gief is like "Oh they're screaming just as usual"
[2:06:39] <silentblast93> got you
[2:06:43] <+Mitchellsocks> I was literally JUST reading a thread about how the game is light on jumpscares
[2:06:43] <%Arweynn> It's dangerous to go alone; take this *stabs*
[2:06:44] <+asaoirc> you got the stabbo
[2:06:51] <natebud> @NigelSchnauzerpug Yeah, you can just walk into the ghosts most of the time with no consequence. No real threat unless the music is on
[2:06:52] <+asaoirc> stop messing with the crabbo
[2:06:52] <%chiazam> "You should keep this with you for now" IS A BUG BECAUSE OF AN ITEM
[2:06:57] <marrowjuice> i love the design imagery in this, but the game can't quite seem to get it together
[2:06:59] <+TheBitingIrish> Is that Elmo snoring in the background?
[2:07:00] <+Joe2187> @PatStaresAt you need to give woolie your extra PS5
[2:07:01] <+asaoirc> You should take this with you
[2:07:08] <%bevyrage> @natebud you weren't around for the first stream where he did chapter 3 first bruv. @NigelSchnauzerpug the game goes full inception and shutter island in one of the chapters, with a splash of the most recent resident evil in it
[2:07:09] <heart_ablaze> save you fool
[2:07:12] <%G_Thunders> If taking a picture is effective, I beat this chapter without ever realizing it.
[2:07:20] <rjhascancer> YO THOSE RUG PHYSICS THO
[2:07:23] <%josstyl_0> checkpoints are not their strong suit
[2:07:24] <eimple> TTours
[2:07:28] <%vVAstrAVv> that was not extremely far back pat its less than a minute
[2:07:30] <+Jonrskittles> just joined, whys he taking so many pics
[2:07:35] <RubberFistFight> @Pars_Librum one of my gripes is they give you heavy weapons and then prevent you using them via severe ammo restrictions. What would have been better is making the super-heavies drop BFG ammo at a rare but non-0 pace.
[2:07:38] <CappuccinoGuil> Legit, I'm so excited for Reggie to play Demon's Souls LUL
[2:07:38] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> BEST FRIENDS BTW
[2:07:41] <natebud> @bevyrage I was there. I was walking him through it. Chapter is awful
[2:07:45] <%BoxNavy> does he not wanna play the preorder game?
[2:07:49] <akitanito> The desire sensor is real
[2:07:55] <+Helmed> are you guys friends LUL
[2:07:56] <RubberFistFight> Thus encouraging you to use the BFG and Unmaykr, instead of leaving you sitting there going "what if i need the ammo later though?"
[2:07:59] <%BoxNavy> preorders have been opening up alot this week
[2:07:59] <%AncelDeLambert> Woolie can EASILY wait a year for stock to become available, he has TONS of shit to play
[2:08:00] <Goodvibes99508> can you pick up the knife?
[2:08:01] <RubberFistFight> Doom 2016 did that right.
[2:08:02] <John_Tsuda> @Jonrskittles To scare ghosts
[2:08:13] <%chiazam> @Jonrskittles It deters the monster, and revelas secrets
[2:08:19] <%AncelDeLambert> Woolie has no damn reason to jump on the earlly adopter wagon
[2:08:20] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @bevyrage Maybe it does, I haven't seen the whole game. I just feel that unless a ghost is attack there isn't much tension to world to be tense.
[2:08:21] <eimple> LUL
[2:08:22] <%king_wragles> Chair is for healing sanity apparently
[2:08:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> @AncelDeLambert im waiting for Half Life 2 so hard
[2:08:25] <+Jonrskittles> @John_Tsuda oh? hmm
[2:08:28] <%Buzzard42> in b4 dead
[2:08:30] <Manwad> @LiquidDinosaur It's good. Still has the goofy bullshit, like a monster made of chicken corpses slapping John's shit, and has some real spooky moments. It does jump around a whole lot, so if you were married to just Dave's perspective, it's kinda eh. You do get more info from more peeps tho.
[2:08:32] <Chaos_kun> Epic gamer moments with Pat
[2:08:36] <+Jonrskittles> @chiazam ty
[2:08:41] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @bevyrage I am aware I said tension to feel tense.
[2:08:41] <silentblast93> so pat do you think cyberpunk will get delaied again?
[2:08:42] <+blastazoid00> Advanced darkness
[2:08:45] <NitronStreams> you continual reminder that I HATE this
[2:08:45] <natebud> Got a spare lighter?
[2:08:47] <eimple> monkaS
[2:08:52] <Gorgs7> Lighter pat!
[2:08:52] <%G_Thunders> God this area sucks
[2:08:57] <Arisato_II> Oh now we're fucked
[2:08:59] <Scorilla> this room is another dead end
[2:09:00] <akitanito> why game
[2:09:00] <Chaos_kun> >using a camera instead of a flashlight
[2:09:01] <natebud> awesome
[2:09:01] <@SoFarFetched> The game is literally forcing him to use camera
[2:09:03] <silentblast93> since we have like 20 days left
[2:09:05] <RubberFistFight> @NigelSchnauzerpug this game has failed two basic tenets of good horror: Less is More, and Nothing is Scarier.
[2:09:12] <huskarl_zap> brass ection
[2:09:13] <+blastazoid00> monkaS
[2:09:14] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> find the door to the light pat!
[2:09:14] <%Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt some of these rooms are specifically eant to be traps
[2:09:15] <huskarl_zap> secction

[2:09:16] <Meekest> BRAAAAAP
[2:09:20] <+blastazoid00> Horror tuba
[2:09:25] <Zalpar> Manwad was it just me, or was it weird that the first book was like 1/5 "Part 1" and then 4/5 "The second book"?
[2:09:27] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> Oof
[2:09:28] <HotMafia81> BRRRRRR

[2:09:31] <eimple> fart monster
[2:09:33] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> Had this happen to me
[2:09:35] <natebud> The game has no consistency. Remember the darkness sanity bar? It's gone now.
[2:09:37] <%Buzzard42> oh god
[2:09:40] <%josstyl_0> got em
[2:09:43] <natebud> chair

[2:10:01] <rytisone> hit the ghost with the chair
[2:10:01] <Chaos_kun> Rumbly tumbly
[2:10:04] <%xcompleasedad> What
[2:10:04] <+Synthos3> You cannot put the chair in your pocket, Pat.
[2:10:05] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt why's your camera all gooey?
[2:10:05] <corepercentlives> chair pockets
[2:10:06] <redrins> use it as a weapon
[2:10:07] <whirly25> just shove the whole chair in your pocket
[2:10:20] <%MyNameIsRasus> good cause i don't

[2:10:23] <%Not_Dutch_> you're on your couch, duh
[2:10:23] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> Empty your hands to move the chair
[2:10:24] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I wanna see more of that dude thrusting his dick at you.
[2:10:25] <thesubgenius912> are we playing wall mart PT today?

[2:13:19] <%Chatterbox1991> GO BACK
[2:13:20] <%xcompleasedad> In the locker
[2:13:21] <%anubisque> on the cardboard box
[2:13:22] <warmnoid> zero shot the ghosties away
[2:13:24] <%Maids4lyfe> check the candle for the key
[2:13:26] <+RowenCleric> Whats better this camera or the Kar98k
[2:13:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> @whirly25 Twitch will take down the ghost
[2:13:29] <+CrimsonAscend> It's quiet...too quiet...
[2:13:39] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, Pat, THE Locker
[2:13:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> @whirly25 ghosts have no power over the Digital Millenium
[2:13:43] <natebud> I wonder how he missed it...
[2:13:49] <%josstyl_0> that was a bad angle
[2:13:51] <%MyNameIsRasus> it's a key and it's rusty indeed
[2:13:52] <akitanito> game needs to highlight stuff better
[2:14:02] <%Laecerelius> Gotta DMCA the ghosts to save the future
[2:14:04] <graeiss> Call an ambulance BUT NOT FOR PAT
[2:14:06] <+MrBaldachin> says man, afraid of ghost
[2:14:08] <%kiiiirsten> omg please play something else i'm beggingi pay you dollars
[2:14:09] <Meekest> BRRRRRNT
[2:14:10] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> You think the ghost's ego will be defeated before Pat finishes the chapter?
[2:14:11] <rytisone> until ghost brings rocket laucnher
[2:14:12] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> incoming squeal when?
[2:14:15] <NitronStreams> BUSTIN MAKES ME FEEL GOOD
[2:14:15] <akitanito> camp and snipe
[2:14:15] <whirly25> @LiquidDinosaur if dmca covered sfx pat's channel would have no hope
[2:14:19] <Arisato_II> He heard you
[2:14:20] <julrave> Pat's so big and strong and handsome now with that camera
[2:14:23] <rjhascancer> that ghost is ripping some nasty farts
[2:14:23] <%josstyl_0> gotem
[2:14:29] <graeiss> SNIPED
[2:14:32] <heart_ablaze> it sound like something from the resident evil movies
[2:14:33] <%MyNameIsRasus> BRRRRRRRAP
[2:14:35] <RubberFistFight> I just realised something - This game is inaccessible to people with epilepsy
[2:14:39] <%Buzzard42> hey I hate that
[2:14:41] <Bonte__> uhhhhh
[2:14:42] <DrStinkers> The woolie hole
[2:14:42] <+MrBaldachin> the boys just vibin
[2:14:42] <%Ranryu692> welp
[2:14:43] <%josstyl_0> need plank?
[2:14:44] <Arisato_II> "people"
[2:14:44] <%Minicow1> Now it's survival horror, so Pat's chill
[2:14:44] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> I THOUGHT THOSE WERE PENISES
[2:14:45] <+ShotgunGlizzy> ShotgunGlizzy subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:14:45] <%Xelhesia> EW
[2:14:46] <graeiss> dont go down
[2:14:46] <John_Tsuda> They're moving
[2:14:46] <devanmuse> oh, those guys from the GREED tape
[2:14:48] <%Laecerelius> Ghost brrraps
[2:14:49] <natebud> ghost people got no reason
[2:14:49] <Bonte__> That's awful
[2:14:53] <NeroInfinite> most horror games are
[2:14:54] <%Maids4lyfe> I DON'T LIKE THAT
[2:14:55] <%spokensun> oh no
[2:14:57] <%chiazam> This camera has seen SOME SHIT
[2:14:59] <Zalpar> A_DEAD_SHOW Disappointed?
[2:15:01] <marrowjuice> step on their gross heads
[2:15:04] <chambatron> Get a tick and poke em
[2:15:13] <%Xelhesia> WEAKEST ORGY I EVER SEEN
[2:15:13] <akitanito> was it that plank you pulled in the basement?
[2:15:17] <RubberFistFight> @NeroInfinite true, but this one SUPER is since camera flashes are a big seizure trigger in epileptics.
[2:15:18] <%josstyl_0> i would have thought so too
[2:15:19] <huskarl_zap> DEVELOPMENT E V I L
[2:15:27] <chambatron> Elbow drop
[2:15:27] <%josstyl_0> chair?
[2:15:27] <Zalpar> establish dominance by peeing on them
[2:15:31] <%G_Thunders> That thing you pulled out of the wall. This whole thing is dumb
[2:15:33] <%vVAstrAVv> you can use A plank
[2:15:34] <huskarl_zap> the evil of construction
[2:15:35] <Scorilla> you would be correct pat
[2:15:36] <ChrisM341> Enemy Step
[2:15:36] <%anubisque> board with eyes on it
[2:15:36] <rytisone> use plank?
[2:15:39] <%anubisque> in the other room
[2:15:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Zalpar maybe you got DOOMs and it will hurt them
[2:15:49] <Scorilla> nearby plank covered in eyes
[2:16:03] <%MyNameIsRasus> Plank with eyes
[2:16:08] <+blastazoid00> Is this the same house as last stream?
[2:16:10] <natebud> Did you actually need the plank from the hole in the wall?
[2:16:22] <Scorilla> no
[2:16:22] <+kuroyami15> Plank you pulled out of the wall
[2:16:25] <%Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt look for a plank with eyes in the room leading to the gap
[2:16:32] <graeiss> dont think so
[2:16:41] <%josstyl_0> cool
[2:16:43] <graeiss> I think it just unlocked something
[2:16:45] <natebud> we're currently in some nonsense house
[2:16:50] <clockworknait1> IT LOOKS SHINY NOW , CHARCTER ALSO HAS SERIAL KILLER GLOVES ON?
[2:17:00] <clockworknait1> sorry caps
[2:17:08] <$FusRoDom> Is this still the same chapter that started in the girl's room?
[2:17:21] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[2:17:25] <%vVAstrAVv> ye
[2:17:26] <graeiss> whut was that
[2:17:28] <natebud> Like this isn't Pat's fault. This is just how they made the game
[2:17:28] <+el_baby_rain> Turnaround, room with light
[2:17:29] <Scorilla> it should be in that first corner you checked
[2:17:36] <%bevyrage> @FusRoDom yes. chapters in visage are basically their own mini-horror games
[2:17:43] <+blastazoid00> That hole looks easily jumpable
[2:17:45] <%floralkami> so... someone needed to see the child neglect to get to the problem?
[2:17:50] <%josstyl_0> another bad angle
[2:17:52] <%Minicow1> The one acceptable piece of wood
[2:17:53] <%Punchasaur> why the fuck is smosh trending
[2:17:56] <+el_baby_rain> dooddood dooddood dooddood
[2:17:56] <Arisato_II> Can't beat a whole with your camera, bitch? -Ghost
[2:17:57] <%Buzzard42> grant us eyes, grant us eyes
[2:17:59] <graeiss> wooden shield parry the monster
[2:18:00] <%josstyl_0> yeah]
[2:18:01] <marrowjuice> this chapter started out so strong, but i'm straight up not scared now
[2:18:01] <natebud> Pat only uses Eye brand planks
[2:18:03] <%MyNameIsRasus> it looks walkable with a wide step
[2:18:14] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt so I'm thinking this game might be a serious problem for people who suffer seizures due to the forced use of the camera flash. What's your opinion on that? Note that I don't think the devs should get dragged or anything, i just find it a slightly sad realisation.
[2:18:15] <%Punchasaur> haven't thought about them since like 2008
[2:18:18] <graeiss> OH
[2:18:19] <%josstyl_0> nope
[2:18:22] <graeiss> TearGlove BibleThump

[2:19:21] <akitanito> tbf he has undies
[2:19:21] <+illusiveSaint> meatmen
[2:19:21] <%wydamn> When your girl puts on full-body tights.
[2:19:21] <clockworknait1> why did they steal silent hill 4 door?
[2:19:22] <%Laecerelius> Okay
[2:19:22] <%Xelhesia> HOW FAR WILL THIS SET YOU BACK?
[2:19:24] <graeiss> he's camera shy
[2:19:24] <PanicSwytch> The mannequin killed u?
[2:19:26] <warmnoid> sir please move
[2:19:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> man this flash mechanic seems good for like 5 min then becomes annoyoing
[2:19:30] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> It's like that horror movie 'Lights Out', the trailer was better than the movie
[2:19:30] <%LilNatFour> LilNatFour subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Don't show nintendo good netcode it makes them scared
[2:19:32] <+MrMcCrabby> Yup it was a monster Jebaited
[2:19:33] <+asaoirc> VIBE CHECK
[2:19:38] <%josstyl_0> no more scare
[2:19:40] <NeroInfinite> I didn't like that
[2:19:45] <graeiss> RUN
[2:19:45] <natebud> You could have walked up to Dolores every time you saw her too, except she just vanishes.
[2:19:50] <%josstyl_0> red
[2:19:51] <graeiss> RUUUUUUUUUUN
[2:19:53] <Sypheck> murder light monkaS
[2:19:56] <%chiazam> the vibe was checked
[2:19:56] <%boomstickery> how high are peoples standards for horror that they complain about not being scared by a game they aren't playing while chatting with people
[2:20:04] <%StaceMcGate> How close are you to poop pants?
[2:20:06] <clockworknait1> @RAAAAAINMAKER the youtube short was better than the trailer
[2:20:08] <%MyNameIsRasus> @RubberFistFight as an epipileptic (but mine is real weak, so meds just nullify it) i think it's really easily solvable by just making the flashes less bright
[2:20:15] <Soarkke> Soarkke subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:20:17] <%wydamn> Jeez, I legit feel so bad for Smash players.
[2:20:18] <@SoFarFetched> Horror is literally case by case with each person,if you don't get scared you don't get scared geefShrug
[2:20:21] <graeiss> yes
[2:20:25] <%DianaTheAscian> oh boy I just read that Nintendo statement about smash
[2:20:26] <natebud> @boomstickery Well, I played it already before this.
[2:20:30] <+trav2_> no :) (yes)
[2:20:30] <huskarl_zap> those photos are of the ghosts lol
[2:20:32] <Zalpar> boomstickery you could say that about everything, though. Bro, international politics is SO EASY when I don't know anything about it or anyone invovled and don't work in politics
[2:20:34] <%chiazam> this is very disorienting
[2:20:35] <%josstyl_0> no lamp i gues
[2:20:39] <graeiss> what was the statement
[2:20:45] <+jack_arbor> GO
[2:20:50] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> They say the scariest thing is commitment
[2:20:53] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Spooky letter?
[2:20:58] <Scorilla> @natebud kinda agree with him bud, your standards seem a little high
[2:20:58] <%josstyl_0> can you examine a letter>
[2:20:58] <%king_wragles> @SoFarFetched Did you subscribe to that channel just for the emotes? LUL
[2:21:05] <%Xelhesia> UH WUT
[2:21:09] <graeiss> silent hill

[2:21:15] <Arisato_II> The Woolie room
[2:21:16] <%Gloom_Tangerine> Pat did you see that the secret door in Demon’s Souls got opened?
[2:21:17] <+blastazoid00> A car Pog
[2:21:18] <clockworknait1> pt garge confirmed
[2:21:22] <@SoFarFetched> @king_wragles maybe,his voice is also really good too.
[2:21:24] <RubberFistFight> @MyNameIsRasus oh yeah for sure, if they dropped the brightness and made the pattern less "regular" it would probably lower the risk considerably.
[2:21:25] <+asaoirc> Don't climb on paige, that's rude
[2:21:25] <huskarl_zap> garbage town of anor londo
[2:21:26] <%Arweynn> as one does, in the house of paige
[2:21:27] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> CLIMB THE TRASH!

[2:21:33] <natebud> @Scorilla just discount silent hill. Can't get behind it.
[2:21:34] <+trav2_> station wagon in the basement garbage pile no biggie
[2:21:42] <%chiazam> back here again huh
[2:21:45] <+jack_arbor> It’s the Woolie “hole”
[2:21:47] <Zalpar> well, you weren't gonna escape
[2:21:49] <Arisato_II> But is it a good trhing?
[2:21:50] <rytisone> yay, the hellhouse
[2:21:50] <%chiazam> Saving....
[2:21:51] <%Buzzard42> you know, like you do
[2:21:55] <+scrumbotime> or DID YOU?!?!
[2:21:57] <%josstyl_0> another lighter
[2:21:59] <+mckraven> that camera flash actually makes it harder for me to see
[2:22:00] <%Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt upstairs bathroom
[2:22:02] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> Oddly comforting?
[2:22:02] <%cowardlord> psaJpeg
[2:22:05] <%chiazam> Back on my bullshit
[2:22:06] <julrave> didn't like that, didn't like that
[2:22:09] <+el_baby_rain> Turn around
[2:22:10] <Scorilla> fair, but in its defense it was marketed as "Inspired by" and was made by like 5 people
[2:22:13] <RubberFistFight> @MyNameIsRasus like if they made it less of a "strobe" effect, since the regularity of strobing is what triggers the aberrant neuron firing.
[2:22:14] <clockworknait1> this feels like silenh hills made in ps4 dreams lol
[2:22:20] <MrNoobMcSalt> save?
[2:22:24] <Zalpar> hey cool, wall scratches
[2:22:26] <%Ner234> I wish I had dreams FeelsBadMan
[2:22:27] <%josstyl_0> hello bathroom
[2:22:34] <%Buzzard42> the bye bye man is PISSED
[2:22:35] <%ChrisPlaysThing> My pupper makes the cutest little dream borks
[2:22:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> remember in King of the Hill when the dog is trying to kill him and he feeds it sleeping pills and then its peacefully dreaming of murdering him?
[2:22:49] <huskarl_zap> ending is dumb
[2:22:49] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> oh, is this that horror game he did that was #sponsored?
[2:22:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> BIl*
[2:22:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> kill bill*
[2:23:01] <@SoFarFetched> @SaltkeyAndAckfish no that was The Signifier
[2:23:03] <%wydamn> I see you, batrewm
[2:23:04] <%josstyl_0> remove curtain?
[2:23:06] <%twoto858> There a werewolf around?
[2:23:11] <%Puhff> Nice
[2:23:12] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @SoFarFetched oh right
[2:23:13] <natebud> And the lights will flicker on and off
[2:23:17] <%josstyl_0> stinky boi
[2:23:19] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @SoFarFetched what was that about again? XD
[2:23:23] <Zalpar> "Ah, shower again." You have not showered even once in this game.
[2:23:24] <+scrumbotime> SOAP AAAAHHH
[2:23:25] <RubberFistFight> @MyNameIsRasus I would say people with moderate or severe epilepsy should probably still avoid it, but usually they avoid all video games that aren't EXPLICITLY built with them in mind anyway, because why take the risk?
[2:23:27] <+mckraven> trapped in the bathroom. now anyone who finds your body will think you died on the toilet
[2:23:27] <%bevyrage> can you stand in the shower and close the curtain?
[2:23:27] <%Buzzard42> Pat Smells At
[2:23:27] <%chiazam> JAM IT UP
[2:23:30] <%SirGO0SE> stinky binky :)
[2:23:31] <+Scevda> oh! Hes still playing it, did he change his mind?
[2:23:33] <+lordericter> gotta wash off the melee smell or they won't let you out
[2:23:34] <rytisone> now you gotta bathe
[2:23:38] <natebud> Now wait twenty seconds i guess.
[2:23:38] <$RealThiele> nobody gives me the razz
[2:23:39] <%BinaryFireball> take control and turn the light off yourself!
[2:23:39] <%Ranryu692> at least youre already in the bathroom

[2:23:59] <%MyNameIsRasus> @RubberFistFight yeah, most videogames nowadays have explicit warning against epilepsy
[2:24:00] <clockworknait1> paige is peeing
[2:24:04] <Zalpar> scrumbotime Shampoo

[2:24:19] <Scorilla> i will agree certain design elements are downright stupid
[2:24:21] <+mckraven> spooky
[2:24:22] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> That sounded like big diarrhea in the dark
[2:24:23] <%JeanGardner99> I walked away, did he win the Visage yet

[2:40:01] <AMajorTom> I actually want DeS but I voted to troll
[2:40:06] <%heartlesshealer> I wish people were willing to assassinate the bad presidents instead of just the good ones
[2:40:06] <%ItalianWaifu> oh fuck did i miss the stream

[2:40:16] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> They're cheap to make is why

[2:40:41] <%josstyl_0> bugsnax is like survival horror
[2:40:41] <%BoxNavy> write a thesis
[2:40:42] <%Dementedpenguin> @ItalianWaifu Visage ended a few minutes ago, Pat made a poll on what to play next
[2:40:43] <%Agami23> its a math equation
[2:40:43] <%DianaTheAscian> which is lame
[2:40:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> @heartlesshealer Man saying shit like that will literally get you put on a list.

[2:40:50] <%RobotPancake> they have no rules in movies. its mostly plot contrivance
[2:40:51] <Ravingpyro> moar bunger
[2:40:51] <Ipsenscastle> Pat is preventing DeS fans from observing the poll
[2:40:51] <Daxalog> Player can miss subtlety and think the game is just boring
[2:40:51] <%TheDugness> I FUCKED UP
[2:40:54] <%ssjklyco> If Pat ever made a game, it would just be RE2 again
[2:40:55] <heart_ablaze> horror needs subtlety and atmosphere
[2:40:55] <%za7az> @PatStaresAt Do it!
[2:40:57] <%TinyLittleDancer> The political memes are hilarious

[2:41:16] <gustavozxd> oh no
[2:41:17] <+OhioNitsud> bugsnax is the get out of video games
[2:41:18] <olobosossegado> This is some awful voting turnout

[3:50:09] <%Bwsdante> pat simulator
[3:50:13] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> how pat sees the world
[3:50:20] <%HitchhikingThrough> @doc_ock_rokc but he had it inside the house though
[3:50:22] <John_Tsuda> Make yourself progressively bigger
[3:50:32] <%heartlesshealer> oh this shit
[3:50:32] <$HairyRavioliToad> Gonna get a lot of size jokes tonight huh
[3:50:35] <%Entroseth> I wonder what that nice man's name is
[3:50:36] <%HitchhikingThrough> it wasn't the puzzle solution
[3:50:38] <%HitchhikingThrough> but he could
[3:50:42] <%Xelhesia> ok that one got me
[3:50:42] <+waltzqueen> Hello! My name is Doctor Bad-Job Not-Soothing
[3:50:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @HitchhikingThrough there is no inside of the house
[3:50:46] <%LouieRouie> Become Giant
[3:50:47] <Vashido22> oh I think I got this tone
[3:50:52] <Louie_Salmon> Almost brute smarts
[3:50:53] <walrusthebaconking> dig up stupid
[3:50:56] <AncyentMarinere> What is even going on
[3:50:56] <jorniev> BECOME BIIIIIG
[3:50:57] <$HairyRavioliToad> smaller = "pat size" bigger = "pat penis size"
[3:50:58] <%heartlesshealer> what's the thing in the corner?
[3:51:00] <%linSP> this is the pat solution
[3:51:00] <%BoxNavy> BOOM
[3:51:01] <%HitchhikingThrough> @doc_ock_rokc oh true
[3:51:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @HitchhikingThrough thats how I solved it
[3:51:02] <jorniev> HUGE QUEST PAT
[3:51:06] <+Mmffgg147> just build lol
[3:51:08] <%BoxNavy> what
[3:51:12] <$RealThiele> ramp?
[3:51:14] <Zalpar> doc_ock_rokc now you're thinking with Port- ... .... Superliminals.
[3:51:15] <%HitchhikingThrough> @doc_ock_rokc that makes sense thank you
[3:51:20] <justinjones1989> Thats what she said
[3:51:21] <omen_setter> give me the biggest seed bell you've got. no, that's too big
[3:51:25] <$HairyRavioliToad> The solution here is so slick
[3:51:26] <BooitsDock> gotta be patt size
[3:51:26] <CSeriesJTYPE> this doesnt make any fucking sense
[3:51:33] <Cobaltor_252> do you tho
[3:51:38] <ryanccurtis> I forgot how you do this one
[3:51:44] <%kingmemelord97> So are the models changing sizes in real time or are the scripted to fast load in and out ?
[3:51:45] <%linSP> theres like 3 ways
[3:51:55] <Solidus_113> bigger, jeff gerstmann style
[3:51:56] <Onamar> There's a bunch of ways to do this one
[3:51:57] <%derekwst3> balance one on top?
[3:51:57] <%Laecerelius> You did a similar puzzle just like two minutes ago
[3:52:01] <%HitchhikingThrough> @kingmemelord97 real time
[3:52:01] <%chiazam> c'mon pat, platform
[3:52:04] <%Bwsdante> pat in wonderland over here
[3:52:04] <Arisato_II> Oi
[3:52:05] <+CapnClassix> PAT
[3:52:06] <sydowoodo> smaller
[3:52:06] <%TheShal> OI M8
[3:52:06] <+Skaphel> put the door in the keyhole ?
[3:52:06] <NitronStreams> still too big
[3:52:08] <Teras_ode> oi
[3:52:09] <+CapnClassix> PUT A DOOR THROUGH THE KEYHOLE
[3:52:10] <%LoneFonte> OY
[3:52:10] <%HitchhikingThrough> it'd be way harder to fast load in and out
[3:52:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt turning auzy on us?
[3:52:11] <Vashido22> oi mate
[3:52:11] <%heartlesshealer> too big
[3:52:11] <%SmoochSpider> why are you australian
[3:52:14] <$HairyRavioliToad> @kingmemelord97 I would assume scale is being edited on the fly, otherwise how tf do you get this framerate
[3:52:15] <RaidenRising> M8
[3:52:15] <a_mad_dragon> psaWrong
[3:52:16] <%FattimusSlime> Just put a door inside the keyhole
[3:52:17] <+MayorRev> how many times have you said to paige that you need to be the right size
[3:52:23] <akitanito> rotate your shit
[3:52:25] <cherrycottontail> pat can you do better pls
[3:52:37] <%arancet> just resizing models in real time isnt that hard
[3:52:41] <%Punchasaur> this captures the feeling of seemingly simple things being impossible in dreams
[3:52:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> too big
[3:52:48] <$HairyRavioliToad> Almost
[3:52:48] <%arancet> but getting the perspective right is
[3:52:50] <%Bwsdante> psaDown
[3:52:51] <%abusywizard> not the first time pat’s had a hard time being too big lmao
[3:52:51] <AncyentMarinere> Is this the dark souls of puzzle games
[3:52:53] <Zalpar> oh I think I figured it out
[3:52:54] <Mr_Strut> The orb won't fit
[3:52:55] <HorribleHog> not hard, but not done before either
[3:52:57] <%JeanGardner99> damn if only he could just teleport up there
[3:52:58] <$RealThiele> LUL
[3:52:59] <+Skaphel> Door through keyhole
[3:53:01] <%Tearonex> ...
[3:53:02] <+Mmffgg147> patrick...
[3:53:06] <walrusthebaconking> get through that keyhole boy!!!! get the keyblade!!!
[3:53:08] <%Entroseth> At the risk of sounding insane, I don't think platforming is the solution to this one
[3:53:12] <+Skaphel> i beg you pat
[3:53:17] <%peachyprimrose> Spoilers obviously, but he needs to put a door in the keyhole and then walk through the other doorway
[3:53:22] <%heartlesshealer> Damn pat, if only you could walk out onto the keyhole
[3:53:23] <rytisone> not from here
[3:53:25] <%bevyrage> BIG DOOR ON BOTTOM THEN STACK SMALL DOOR ON TOP? then walk through big door to be small on top?
[3:53:26] <$HairyRavioliToad> @arancet yeah, plus lighting
[3:53:34] <sydowoodo> you're getting there
[3:53:36] <%Bwsdante> yessss
[3:53:39] <$HairyRavioliToad> He's getting it methinks
[3:53:39] <+RyTYoung> oh hey Pat and chat
[3:53:42] <%linSP> maybe if pat was giant he'd have the right perspective
[3:53:44] <%BoxNavy> its so small :)

[4:19:00] <Hyphixsys> @lucas18293 don't think anyone would win, since everyone would be probably trapped in a maze LUL
[4:19:03] <thesubgenius912> psaDogchamp
[4:19:05] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I forgot the solution here honestly..... I remember a cool puzzle around the corner tho
[4:19:06] <%HitchhikingThrough> try staring at the door from an angle?
[4:19:08] <%bevyrage> it's a dream. you've never been able to see yourself in a dream
[4:19:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @HitchhikingThrough wait for it
[4:19:09] <jopeeps123> psaDogchamp_TK
[4:19:12] <Zalpar> You see yourself as you wish to see yourself. But you do not, so you do not.
[4:19:14] <Teras_ode> but what if you have no self? 🤔
[4:19:16] <ryanccurtis> I forgot how to do this one, but I think I have an idea
[4:19:20] <%Punchasaur> gief already figured it out. perspective is reality. if you don't look at the game, it can't trick you
[4:19:23] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Look through the windows?
[4:19:31] <$ringabal> SPEEEEEEN
[4:19:31] <Tisaric> this one is a little tricky
[4:19:35] <%twistedj3ster> gotta really think outside the box on this one
[4:19:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @bevyrage you've never seen your face
[4:19:39] <%heartlesshealer> no pat, you're just coming out the other side
[4:19:40] <Hyphixsys> NICE
[4:19:41] <Tisaric> see
[4:19:41] <Louie_Salmon> It's such a bamboozle

[4:21:44] <Zalpar> What made Pat so good at things like this? There's some odd things I'm good at cause of old stupid flash games with weird rules
[4:21:45] <Hyphixsys> @ammobasket SLAP LIKE
[4:21:46] <%roscoe_rosaline> Pat makes mistakes because he's already started solving the next puzzle before even reaching it.
