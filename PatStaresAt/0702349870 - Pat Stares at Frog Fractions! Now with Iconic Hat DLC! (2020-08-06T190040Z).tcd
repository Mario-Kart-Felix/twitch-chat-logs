[0:14:31] <+feiashtear> fractions math better than decimals
[0:14:33] <$jarednotwithsubway> Frog will divide us
[0:14:34] <+OwlLightningMage> Big correct
[0:14:34] <%lunaraci> they suck
[0:14:35] <%Skelegroove> Fractions are more perfect than decimals
[0:14:36] <%nimu290> pet other baby
[0:14:36] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Yes, and I'll use that line next time I see someone using fractions
[0:14:36] <iosephe> We will not be fractioned
[0:14:37] <%ladomania> fractions are how you show repeating numbers
[0:14:39] <$jarednotwithsubway> I did know that
[0:14:39] <clumsydemiurge> The virgin 1/3 vs the CHAD 0.333333333333333
[0:14:39] <comedeity> more accurate tho
[0:14:40] <@ShockzNDrawe> They're really not
[0:14:40] <lunargem> Yes
[0:14:40] <%waddledoops> waddledoops subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Woo I finally have good enough internet to watch a stream again! This sub 3 mbps is actual trash but can at least handle the streaming.
[0:14:42] <honeyman18> This is the game that finishes Pat isn't it?
[0:14:43] <Orenjevel> decimal points are for people too lazy to write out scientific notation numbers
[0:14:44] <raikagelord1> Yes
[0:14:45] <%demegodz> KONG is good
[0:14:45] <Medo3G> factions > decimals
[0:14:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Reminder that Paige thinks in fractions
[0:14:49] <%BinaryFireball> Wait is this game a bio lesson or a math lesson? Are frogs dissected in this game?
[0:14:51] <%twoto858> I always thought it was the other way around
[0:14:52] <Leto_II_Hederach> uhh...
[0:14:55] <Lutre> kong's built real tough, somehow my shithead terrier still chews through it though
[0:14:56] <$payatanharkonnen> Are you drunk
[0:14:57] <+feiashtear> base ten sucks
[0:14:58] <jerree66> KONG is really good quality
[0:14:58] <+cdrom321> Did you know that fractions are just unsolved division expressions?
[0:15:00] <+RealPT1> Kong can take a beating
[0:15:01] <TungstenViper> so, if i say 1.25 instead of 1/4 it's clearer to you?
[0:15:03] <@ShockzNDrawe> They tell you they're durable but if the dog really wants to they'll tear right through Kongs
[0:15:03] <Coystick> Get Gief a toy plushy Sif sword

[2:05:56] <%mighty_max_t> @Aztec50 She's just the new Demiurge, it's cool
[2:06:07] <%nimu290> @asgard147 video game is happening
[2:06:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @asgard147 we are learningfrog fractions

[2:07:11] <%Garthunox> hasn't this game rolled credits twice already?
[2:07:13] <%DedlokPM> This game is pretty much Steamworld Dig 1 &2 but with frogs
[2:07:31] <%DedlokPM> @Garthunox we are in postgame
[2:07:31] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> Should have gone back sooner
[2:07:32] <+MelodyMedley> This game really makes you feel like you're brushing teeth
[2:07:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> He dug too far, and too greedily
[2:07:42] <Medo3G> too greedy
[2:07:43] <+LiveStreamOnyx> @dedlokpm no this game is about Fractions
[2:07:44] <Orenjevel> TRAPPED FOR ETERNITY
[2:07:45] <%Dementedpenguin> Jesus christ was that phone always there? I just noticed LUL
[2:07:52] <%thegreenbenis> What if I don't like frogs or fraction?
[2:07:55] <MayorRev> R
[2:07:57] <$RealThiele> for the love of god Montressor !
[2:08:02] <+Deekman> how is this still going?!
[2:08:04] <Klonoa__> like most dwarfs tbh
[2:08:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> @thegreenbenis nonsense, everyone loves frogs and fractions
[2:08:26] <%maenos2> how can you not like frogs
[2:08:33] <+LiveStreamOnyx> @dementedpenguin yeah it‚Äôs your Bugberry phone
[2:08:39] <+Opal_Overture> OR fractions
[2:08:39] <Orenjevel> frogs are like water puppies
[2:08:40] <%CappuccinoGuil> 32 gems
[2:08:46] <%DedlokPM> @LiveStreamOnyx yes, but we are learning fraction while in a Steamworld Dig like mode. teenJOY
[2:08:51] <$RealThiele> damn you gravity
[2:09:05] <%Dementedpenguin> @LiveStreamOnyx Oh ok, I just came in 5 minutes ago, so I'm processing everything LUL
[2:09:10] <+LiveStreamOnyx> @dedlokpm lytOMG
[2:09:26] <+Rykorr> how are the fractions going
[2:09:31] <%AthenaAegis> I look away for a few and we Boulder Dash now
[2:09:33] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[2:09:39] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[2:09:40] <%Metballs> Greedyboi
[2:09:48] <%CJett92> HOW CAN THIS BEEEE
[2:09:51] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> go back immediately
[2:09:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> Maybe set a return route before going too far?
[2:09:52] <Ids560> you can just be a massive coward
[2:09:53] <audrus> just go back now
[2:09:54] <audrus> ye
[2:09:58] <@SoFarFetched> there you go
[2:10:02] <%StrifeZubia> Yeah just dig straight down again pat, this time you'll have enough ladders
[2:10:05] <%bhp_99> smart
[2:10:10] <%CJett92> Dig up stupid
[2:10:32] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> dig up stupid 4Head
[2:10:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> On no the first sign of the end of the world! Pat using his brain!
[2:10:55] <+LiveStreamOnyx> Pat learned how to fraction his ladder usage, good job lytSHADES
[2:11:03] <%Ipsenscastle> this seems remarkably dull for Frog Fractions :(
[2:11:22] <audrus> drop your ladders
[2:11:26] <animaikaru> psaGoblin
[2:11:33] <$RealThiele> so yea that Aon must die trailer was made by scabs that dont even own all the IP for the art
[2:11:44] <chicken_danger> upgrades?
[2:11:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If Pat was more judicious with his planning, we'd be done with this in a fraction of the time B)
[2:11:50] <%Dementedpenguin> Now you're thinking with ladders. PogChamp
[2:12:01] <%Dementedpenguin> I think
[2:12:04] <dan_g_v> when is time for sony?
[2:12:07] <+LiveStreamOnyx> @realthiele how did Sony not realize that?
[2:12:12] <%Ipsenscastle> @RealThiele that's insane. I'm looking forward to the big expos√© on this
[2:12:15] <Medo3G> I think hardiness allows you to breaker stronger blocks
[2:12:22] <$RealThiele> life of black panther. that is all
[2:12:25] <audrus> careful of water falling and ndeeding ladders
[2:12:26] <+RenoDeGeneric> Sony's thing is already over
[2:12:28] <CursedNobleman> DansGame
[2:12:30] <%Ipsenscastle> @dan_g_v came and went
[2:12:34] <rufus2k2> black TIGER
[2:12:36] <someguynamedsam87> SSSsss PunchTrees
[2:12:42] <$RealThiele> oh excuse me
[2:12:44] <dan_g_v> oh wow, didnt even notice
[2:12:45] <$RealThiele> LUL
[2:12:49] <%spiritofmojave> gotta manage to avoid it
[2:12:51] <%AlphaTauri> this game teaches so much
[2:12:56] <%Jekado> wait... frogs are amphibians?
[2:12:59] <%nimu290> why does a frog need to stop for air
[2:13:15] <rufus2k2> as are turtles...well some of them
[2:13:20] <dan_g_v> that's one deep voice for the tiny froggo
[2:13:25] <$RealThiele> hes gotta breathe through his skin like Rain
[2:13:30] <Medo3G> that;s a bad
[2:13:33] <+LiveStreamOnyx> Frogs fractions their air/water breathing, so you have to be careful
[2:13:36] <+lethallylactic> Frogs aren't fish LUL
[2:13:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Adult frogs need air, infants don't
[2:13:37] <%Mrbaconator> rats also can't swim
[2:13:38] <%NovaKnightmare> Yea but it takes a while
[2:13:40] <audrus> frogs are like slimy bubbles think about it
[2:13:41] <testis1> wow
[2:13:44] <rufus2k2> frogs still have lungs, no gills
[2:13:44] <%cvp5127> stupid amphibians pick a side
[2:13:47] <%bhp_99> ye, they grow lungs when they become frog
[2:13:50] <+CelioHogane> Did you know toads don't ever go in water?
[2:13:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> 7 11
[2:13:51] <olaksi> I know it's true, but sounds like BS coming from Pat
[2:13:52] <%afronooch> pats right according to the first thing on google
[2:13:54] <%CJett92> sounds fake but ok
[2:14:19] <testis1> they have wierd circulatory systems
[2:14:21] <+Anonylesssss> @PatStaresAt So frogs can actually breathe thru their skin for a long period of time pat,but it is true eventually their skin wont be able to intake enough air underwater
[2:14:34] <audrus> flood cavern with ladder
[2:14:55] <%NWR_James> bristle so hard, gurl
[2:14:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Now you can get to that sublevel
[2:15:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Brushie brushie brushie
[2:15:10] <%Zombino924> you were almost done too
[2:15:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pat, what do you think reset means?
[2:15:21] <%Zombino924> with this part of the map anyhow
[2:15:21] <$RealThiele> and he was never seen again. some say to this day hes down in that cave brushing
[2:15:32] <+LiveStreamOnyx> yovgStare
[2:15:34] <Medo3G> oh it unlcleans teeth
[2:15:34] <Torivore> Maybe cave water's not so great in oxygen content
[2:15:35] <Medo3G> damn
[2:15:37] <CursedNobleman> NotLikeThis
[2:16:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> Anybody noticed the respawn here is just like in Katana Zero? Hop and Toby just say "I would drown if I did that"

[2:18:22] <cosmicgoatee> LUL gorshed it
[2:18:29] <Autist28> Is this drill doser with frogs?
[2:18:29] <$RealThiele> rip
[2:18:31] <morningmoondude> hard to believe that pat's enjoying frogs and avoided the rise and fall of Aeon lol
[2:18:34] <%DappercatEsquire> I feel like he's getting the same enjoyment from setting up those ladder routes as Death Stranding ziplines
[2:18:56] <$RealThiele> god that was the fastest hype/unhype for me ever i have whiplash aon
[2:18:58] <Medo3G> you can switch tho
[2:19:04] <Medo3G> right?
[2:19:07] <WeebFever> Patrick Staresat, u have very large greed

[2:19:24] <%Metballs> Turn around
[2:19:33] <MayorRev> October is sweet
[2:19:39] <+NitronStreams> i think you switch when you move in the direction of the other frog
[2:19:41] <+OwlLightningMage> Is this the rest of the game?
[2:19:46] <MayorRev> best month
[2:19:55] <$RealThiele> for pat probably
[2:20:02] <+MelodyMedley> This is all post game
[2:20:10] <%DedlokPM> @OwlLightningMage this is optional postgame stuff.
[2:20:37] <%NWR_James> brushing your teeth isnt optional
[2:20:42] <%NWR_James> it's good health
[2:20:46] <%Dementedpenguin> Ladder Tech
[2:20:50] <%mighty_max_t> Has there ever been a DLC so expansive?
[2:20:50] <%afronooch> yooooo Froggress
[2:20:59] <%CJett92> Now your thinking with fractions!
[2:20:59] <+OwlLightningMage> Got it
[2:21:03] <%Dementedpenguin> >_>
[2:21:04] <$RealThiele> Ladder tech being fill all empty slots with ladders LUL
[2:21:20] <Drusain> this teeth stuff makes me think we're going to wake up and be asked why we aren't at elf practice
[2:21:23] <%Dementedpenguin> The best kind of tech
[2:21:26] <+NitronStreams> y
[2:21:33] <MayorRev> can you crush gingivitis with rocks
[2:21:33] <%Zombino924> you don't need to get every tooth
[2:21:37] <sophienatorz_unite> brushing your teeth IS optional contrary to popular belief
[2:21:43] <%Zombino924> since resetting keeps your money while letting you redo everything
[2:21:43] <audrus> this fault is pat's
[2:21:53] <+someyounguy1> im literally dying

[2:25:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This probably leads to a water upgrade, if I had to guess
[2:26:03] <KoyaMusa> you can upgrade
[2:26:13] <+LiveStreamOnyx> It‚Äôs all water? Always has been lytUSEGUN
[2:26:39] <$RealThiele> so hard

[2:28:10] <%DedlokPM> @CappuccinoGuil not bricks, but those darker spots and boulders (though the boulder break chance seems to be random)
