[0:03:33] <AlphaRayAllen> breh
[0:03:45] <ennui_on_me> Yep, you can sort it by when you picked things up
[0:03:53] <ennui_on_me> by default it's just by type

[0:07:31] <+brightman42> old hoop
[0:07:31] <%JoshManVGH> Who's ready for Japanese games that don't have pause functions!?
[0:07:32] <%ScreamLord> Do it cowards
[0:07:36] <+U_1___> is it gonna be square or capcom

[0:07:44] <peachy996> Pat Stares At Elden Ring forever
[0:07:48] <%Bluwizard21> I beat elden ring and now I'm playing another character on elden ring
[0:07:49] <MaritimeSpanker> That shirt is rad
[0:07:50] <%Kevlar_Caviar> will there be a single hype announcement today?
[0:07:53] <%Axellogic> Watched the Gamer's Nexus video on Artesian Buils and oof
[0:08:03] <%ScreamLord> Elden Ring actually does reminds me of DD in a few ways
[0:08:04] <cartakus> that is from thing
[0:08:08] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> im still watching last stream what happens in the last hour so i dont have to listen to two pats talking at once
[0:08:12] <iosephe> Yeah
[0:08:15] <%topendbuzza> but there is tho
[0:08:20] <+brightman42> yeah
[0:08:21] <@TheYellowcouch> oops
[0:08:22] <%Glass_Muffin> @PatStaresAt Hi hope your day is good
[0:08:24] <%ospreyworks> Genuinely, what Konami IP do you think Sony purchased? If it's true.
[0:08:24] <%shanna_become_gamer> my mind state: The internet has ruined all -ssy words for me. I just saw an album called "Sassy" and really had to think for a second to remember that's a normal word
[0:08:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> no shut up tho
[0:08:30] <NitronStreams> wait what?
[0:08:32] <+brightman42> 4 presses to pause
[0:08:35] <iosephe> How does that menu option work in multiplayer?
[0:08:36] <%ReenMan350> they forgor
[0:08:37] <%JoshManVGH> Totally not mandatory. That's why Nioh is the way it is isnt it? Pause hurts nothing if your not touching multiplayer
[0:08:37] <%pipboy344> @patstaresat How do you comfortably play with mouse & keyboard on that couch, like with Vampire: The Masquerade- Bloodlines. Lapboard?
[0:08:39] <%greasypete00> I hope they leave that in just to shut them up
[0:08:40] <%SaiyanShoto> Probably an unintentional pause button
[0:08:45] <%topendbuzza> hide the pause for the giggles
[0:08:50] <+TEANTACLES> the amount of haughty devs who are dying to say a slur is nuts
[0:08:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pause has to be as vague and obscure as the rest of the game
[0:08:56] <%boggsz12> the pause menus are obscure just like the wuests
[0:08:56] <nansex> i mean you could always just quit the game to pause in souls games...
[0:08:57] <%ScreamLord> Also mods added a pause function
[0:09:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> Hidden Pause quest
[0:09:09] <%JoshManVGH> Pause is the most powerful Lost Grace.
[0:09:11] <jubejube56> They wanted the feeling of open world discovery to apply to the pause menu :p
[0:09:11] <%josnotforlewd> oh no
[0:09:11] <%chiazam> Wasn’t that Pause function unintentional
[0:09:14] <GhoulishCripple> I'm just laughing at the dev who worked on the Avengers game criticized Elden Rings performance when her game ip doxxed players and crashed consoles
[0:09:17] <greynob2> noooooooooooo
[0:09:17] <mrcelab> Yey, hey Pat! Finally can watch You after surgery. Good times!
[0:09:20] <+TEANTACLES> lmfao
[0:09:21] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> oh dear
[0:09:21] <+TEANTACLES> oh no
[0:09:24] <%sporeian94> CHAOS!?!?!
[0:09:28] <%chiazam> WOOOOOO
[0:09:29] <%lightbringrrrr> eh it's like DMC
[0:09:29] <AlphaRayAllen> That's not very Chaotic of you
[0:09:29] <%greasypete00> haven't hack n slash always tho
[0:09:29] <deviljhojho_> im gonna play on normal like a badass
[0:09:30] <peachy996> ok
[0:09:31] <cartakus> WHO?
[0:09:33] <+Mrbaconator> personally i think if you want a game to be harder.......just you know don't pick easy?
[0:09:33] <+Hammeredmonkey> Hammeredmonkey subscribed with Prime. 
[0:09:34] <%chiazam> CHAOS
[0:09:36] <+Mrbaconator> this isn't rocket science
[0:09:37] <Chaos_Aether> you rang
[0:09:38] <dra_gon401> Hidden Pause button is part of the lore
[0:09:38] <UnderpaidBob> DMC has difficulty options
[0:09:39] <$vehementvadr> God take me right fucking now
[0:09:39] <%JoshManVGH> It has built in summons.
[0:09:40] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat you can't say that
[0:09:42] <%D00msDayDan> only if it has a popup saying "easy mode is now selectable"
[0:09:44] <T_Sasquatch> Nioh devs are crazy people
[0:09:47] <tanarath> Easy mode is as simple as cheesing w/ moonlight or the night & flame sword, I don't get it.
[0:09:53] <lyzejag> Just don't pick easy lmao
[0:09:58] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> you gotta say only real gamers play hard mode lol
[0:09:58] <MechanizedGentleman> we get it you're a sick man
[0:09:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> 🤢
[0:10:00] <%lightbringrrrr> difficulty discourse is terrible
[0:10:03] <%chiazam> More accessibility for the disabled people please
[0:10:06] <owleyet> i have bad reaction times :(
[0:10:07] <peachy996> I'm so sick of both arguments
[0:10:09] <%cooljane3000> pat sick
[0:10:11] <%cooljane3000> just sick
[0:10:13] <T_Sasquatch> Meeee 🎶🎶🎶
[0:10:15] <%Axellogic> Seeing the CEO of artesian completely missing the point of Gamer's Nexus's emails asking for completely transparent interview and trying to ply him with sushi and simultaneously quietly laying off all staff is so sad
[0:10:19] <%CopperTucker> Western devs just wanna say slurs at JP devs.
[0:10:21] <greynob2> LUL
[0:10:22] <peachy996> Just play the game or don't
[0:10:23] <sirtommygunn> unfortunately playing video games and writing are two very different sets of skills
[0:10:27] <%chiazam> Mmmmm Xenophobia disguised as criticism Mmmmmm
[0:10:28] <%TheHateFish> TheHateFish subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! What up, orblin? Not been watching your Elden Ring stuff as I'm behind you and don't want spoilers, but you enjoying yourself? Making enough time to get your tomes?
[0:10:28] <%topendbuzza> "but how can I review this game if I can't beat it"
[0:10:30] <%ospreyworks> Doc made some good points.
[0:10:35] <T_Sasquatch> But meeeeeeeeee
[0:10:38] <%twistedj3ster> I got a cake that looks like a taco, it's mostly frosting but looking at it makes me happy
[0:10:38] <cartakus> do it for the disabled and also for meeeee
[0:10:38] <lyzejag> The Last Of Us 2 is INSANE
[0:10:40] <GhoulishCripple> @chiazam I agree. games need 100% to work on button remapping. I can't play a lot of games that don't have it
[0:10:41] <+keiji_maede> Are is talking about Dragon Age 4? Like we're never going to FUCKING GET IT?!
[0:10:44] <MaritimeSpanker> "greybox mode"?
[0:10:45] <+brightman42> you can complete it blind
[0:10:48] <%D00msDayDan> i just found out horizon forbidden west's difficulty options include turning off the requirement to shoot off machine parts for their loot
[0:10:53] <@QueequegTheater> Colorblind mode, subtitle size/background, there are legit accessibility stuff ER lacks
[0:10:57] <+Beetlewins> FORZA 5 has amazing accessibility modes as well
[0:10:58] <%topendbuzza> someone died to put that in tho
[0:10:59] <lyzejag> It takes you 30 minutes to go trough the options, it's sooooo good
[0:11:04] <MaritimeSpanker> the darkblood soulsring
[0:11:06] <cartakus> dont care tbh
[0:11:08] <%chiazam> It has voice assistance mode
[0:11:10] <@TheYellowcouch> I just wanna be able to order food while playing
[0:11:12] <+abrupt_abe> You can sort of pause, it's weird it's behind Help in the menu
[0:11:13] <@TheYellowcouch> lemme pause
[0:11:19] <%VictorVonLouche> Though with accessibility would like a lockout function to stop myself from "cheating" on the fly  mid session lol.
[0:11:19] <%CopperTucker> more accessability options are always worth it.
[0:11:20] <%greasypete00> tensing causes pain
[0:11:23] <%TheHateFish> Pause but with the same limitations as opening the map
[0:11:23] <Grave_Titan_D> especially if you have kids or pets
[0:11:37] <%lightbringrrrr> just go back to a site of grace
[0:11:42] <AlphaRayAllen> Casuals
[0:11:43] <%lightbringrrrr> fuck man i love ramps
[0:11:43] <TheHatch10> Hell i just want to be able to buy a PS5
[0:11:45] <%shanna_become_gamer> Accessibility baked in from the start can benefit all
[0:11:46] <%GustauveVIII> GustauveVIII subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Hey Pat! What's your favorite and least favorite classes or architypes in RPGs like Baldur's Gate and why?
[0:11:47] <nansex> idk being able to pause and check map at any time in re2 and 3 remake killed all tension for me when stuff is chasing you
[0:11:49] <peachy996> I like to walk on ramps
[0:11:52] <+brightman42> also skateboards
[0:11:52] <@QueequegTheater> I also appreciate a good ramp
[0:11:53] <%topendbuzza> does peach need the ramp? Kappa
[0:11:53] <MechanizedGentleman> old people love ramps, for skateboarding
[0:11:53] <%NBUsagi> Hey Pat! <3
[0:11:54] <peachy996> They're more fun
[0:11:54] <digaogrunge> I like a good ramp
[0:11:56] <+TopTieramisu> tony hawk?
[0:11:59] <GhoulishCripple> it kills me to see people reduce accessibility to difficulty of the game. like saw someone on Twitter doing that and I was ready to reeee
[0:12:00] <%CopperTucker> my best friend is completely colorblind, she would love games she could play without needing to differentiate colors
[0:12:00] <%twistedj3ster> I have poor depth perception, I take the ramps
[0:12:01] <%chiazam> Why can’t I just press the map button to close the map again, game’s great tho
[0:12:02] <sirtommygunn> people trying to move heavy shit fucking love ramps
[0:12:03] <%CeeKay_Plays> make life easier in general
[0:12:04] <lyzejag> My boyfriends has motion sickness/eyestrain for visuals/colors of Elden Ring, no options for anything like that is sad
[0:12:05] <%MisterRockett> old people, people with baby carriages, people with bikes
[0:12:06] <$Futurecity10> Oh wow, a pat stream thats watchable Kappa
[0:12:07] <%ospreyworks> A rising tide lifts all ships
[0:12:08] <%topendbuzza> HELL YEAH
[0:12:09] <cartakus> old people will die if they fall stairs
[0:12:09] <%ScreamLord> Age should be a disability after a point
[0:12:09] <iosephe> Subtitles are also great
[0:12:10] <+brightman42> ramps are sick
[0:12:12] <@MistyMntns> Wanna know what accessibility I love. Closed Captions.
[0:12:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think the problem is the perception of what makes a "disability" is too narrow
[0:12:13] <AlphaRayAllen> You ever use an elevator just because it was easier? PROBABLY
[0:12:13] <%greasypete00> children also enjoy walking up ramps and down them
[0:12:15] <%JoshManVGH> How DARE you be kind to your players. Destroy ALL wrists like as DS Lord Pit demands!
[0:12:16] <%MartinOfLoxley> I love walking up ramps
[0:12:17] <$Artoo__The_Me> Ramps are fun
[0:12:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> also stigmatized
[0:12:18] <peachy996> Ramps > Stairs
[0:12:19] <@TheYellowcouch> They are also fun to slide down in the woiter
[0:12:19] <UnderpaidBob> a lot of these discussions come from a good place, they just aren't articulated very well
[0:12:19] <%abakkus> making things better for people w disabilities has the nifty little side effect of being better for everyone
[0:12:20] <+twdlrr> I always choose the ramp except in winter
[0:12:23] <%topendbuzza> run up & down as a child
[0:12:23] <%chiazam> Ramps are awesome
[0:12:26] <digaogrunge> but RAMP
[0:12:26] <$Artoo__The_Me> You couldn’t skateboard if no ramps
[0:12:28] <%greasypete00> everybody loves ramos
[0:12:30] <@ssjklyco> handicap buttons on doors are good for everyone
[0:12:30] <Gray_LoFi> I've never met a colorblind mode I didn't like
[0:12:30] <%cooljane3000> the ramp was just cooler stairs when i was a little toddler
[0:12:31] <+Beetlewins> I haven't. I don't even walk up hills. 2d plane for life.
[0:12:31] <%greasypete00> ramps*
[0:12:32] <peachy996> Until Winter
[0:12:33] <Grave_Titan_D> skatemboard
[0:12:34] <%TheAdMerlin> Only because the Ramp and stairs were on the right and left side around a middle platform, so it's polite to always stay on the right side
[0:12:34] <Rabicwill> ello ello fellas
[0:12:38] <ennui_on_me> But then you get the people who say "well this guy with one arm could beat it so just try harder" or whatever
[0:12:38] <peachy996> Then don't walk on ramps
[0:12:42] <%MartinOfLoxley> I love closed captions too and I'm not legally deaf
[0:12:42] <owleyet> I like being able to play games for plot and lore but I have bad reaction times and focus so a lot of games aren't accessible without mods or easy mode LUL
[0:12:47] <+twdlrr> YES
[0:12:52] <%chiazam> Handicap doors should just be permanent
[0:12:52] <lyzejag> Hey but when i take the ramp it takes my success back and i don't want the disabled to use the ramp. it's makes me sad :(
[0:12:53] <iosephe> YES
[0:12:53] <%TheHateFish> The chicken shop near me doesn't even *have* stairs - ramps only
[0:12:53] <+rbakervv> fuck yeah
[0:12:54] <%twistedj3ster> I love that change
[0:12:55] <%cooljane3000> YES
[0:12:55] <%VictorVonLouche> When it works
[0:12:55] <%CopperTucker> YES
[0:12:56] <%ospreyworks> YUP
[0:12:57] <HeroToxiko> that was sooo good
[0:13:00] <UnderpaidBob> dude God Hand destroyed my hands
[0:13:02] <Chaos_Aether> I would be nice
[0:13:04] <+TopTieramisu> mashing is dumb
[0:13:05] <+TEANTACLES> HOLDING INSTEAD OF MASHING IS SO MUCH BETTER
[0:13:06] <%chiazam> Fuck that one is GOOD
[0:13:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat's got crack hands
[0:13:10] <%greasypete00> Metroid dread was fucking crazy to see your mashing
[0:13:13] <Chaos_Aether> That would be nice
[0:13:14] <+TEANTACLES> MASHING GIVES ME HAND CRAMPS
[0:13:15] <sirtommygunn> but it hurt
[0:13:17] <%ospreyworks> Anyone with Carpal Tunnel will agree.
[0:13:17] <@MistyMntns> Flashbacks to MGS interrogation scene
[0:13:20] <HeroToxiko> the mash prompts are a lie LUL
[0:13:20] <%Valdorick> Mash harder that they break
[0:13:20] <%topendbuzza> too fast
[0:13:22] <GhoulishCripple> yes. I am missing fingers and mashing is sometimes actually impossible. apiderman ps4 is amazing for QTE changes
[0:13:22] <$Artoo__The_Me> Peach knows that well crikPew
[0:13:25] <+brightman42> but fuck it, hold

[0:13:32] <%cooljane3000> I remember the microwave hallway from MGS4 very unfondly
[0:13:36] <ennui_on_me> I replayed Metal Gear Solid 1 last year and my arm was sore as shit for like ten minutes after the torture scene
[0:13:36] <+TEANTACLES> i wish ffxiv would give me a hold option for the qte's in trials
[0:13:39] <peachy996> I fondly remember you vs Woolie in a Mash battle on Anarchy Reigns
[0:13:40] <%twistedj3ster> at least you can do it
[0:13:42] <MaritimeSpanker> it's why HADES is such a pain on the thumb
[0:13:43] <MechanizedGentleman> but my potatoes are lumpy
[0:13:43] <@TheYellowcouch> *looks at ff14 final bosses*
[0:13:44] <%Axellogic> I also hate mash
[0:13:44] <teflonbilly777> 31 shot
[0:13:45] <jumpyhugs> mash input windows? fuck that
[0:13:46] <%MonkeyTimelord> Can you monster mash?
[0:13:46] <HeroToxiko> that fucked up arm shake thing
[0:13:46] <greynob2> git gud at mashing
[0:13:47] <+Kyma1020> Cries in Kh2
[0:13:49] <peachy996> He couldn't handle the power
[0:13:49] <MaritimeSpanker> if you get a good, strong run going, that shit will be felt
[0:13:50] <digaogrunge> It fucks up controllers
[0:13:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> I've never seen a good use of mashing
[0:13:55] <@QueequegTheater> But you're so good at it tho Kappa
[0:13:56] <sirtommygunn> I can't think of a single time when mashing was good
[0:13:56] <%josnotforlewd> i mash da potatoe
[0:13:56] <%chiazam> MGS 1 unleashed the freak beast inside me, fuck Revolver Ocelot
[0:13:56] <Chaos_Aether> Mashing Can also Brek your Controller too
[0:13:57] <lyzejag> Mashing for more than 10 seconds makes my hands hurt so bad
[0:13:58] <%Dakuu75> Really? Hm.
[0:13:58] <Grave_Titan_D> "mash like a freak" pat boivin
[0:13:59] <%notsoy> dmc3 crazy cancels
[0:14:00] <jubejube56> But mashing is immersive or something
[0:14:01] <%chiazam> My fingers
[0:14:01] <%JoshManVGH> Ever do that thing where you put your middle finger and thumb together and rub the button?
[0:14:05] <%chiazam> My poor fingers
[0:14:07] <%Axellogic> Mashle of Magic and Muscles is cool tho
[0:14:08] <teflonbilly777> Play Track and Field on NES on stream you coward!
[0:14:10] <jumpyhugs> Metroid Dread had me double thumb mashin
[0:14:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh this door is so hard to open gotta push button fast
[0:14:11] <%Daskolin> @MistyMntns my fingers had jolt of electricity, the moment i read this
[0:14:12] <+Beetlewins> in England we call them Mutton Mashers
[0:14:14] <%greasypete00> "button mashing your way to a rotator cuff injury"
[0:14:16] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt Pat, I love You, but i dont think You can mash as fast as Ludwig.
[0:14:20] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:14:23] <%topendbuzza> it has one tho
[0:14:25] <%Buttlo> The only time I really hate mashing is when it's on a small button I can't double tap, otherwise I just hate it an appropriate amount.
[0:14:27] <peachy996> In the words of someone frome the mk scene "Stop mashing Bitch!"
[0:14:30] <%boggsz12> i wish more people discussing this would embrace the 'a win is a win' mentality when playing these games. Boss is too hard? Cheese that fucker, lie steal cheat, fuck em
[0:14:33] <%CeeKay_Plays> There's a pause already
[0:14:35] <%JoshManVGH> That game is HUGE! Let me pause and take a poopie!
[0:14:37] <+TEANTACLES> wait which mod
[0:14:40] <%ospreyworks> How is the PC version coming along?
[0:14:43] <+TEANTACLES> lagged out
[0:14:43] <MaritimeSpanker> whoah
[0:14:43] <sirtommygunn> The Sega Pause Button
[0:14:47] <MaritimeSpanker> very short zoom there
[0:14:50] <%ospreyworks> Is it still noticeably stuttery?
[0:14:55] <@QueequegTheater> L2/R2
[0:14:59] <BurdRightsActivist> There's a pause already. Just save/quit LUL
[0:15:02] <%NBUsagi> Its weird how you mention a pause button and some people genuinely have an anurism. LIke dude i dont want to have to quit out of the game or in the middle of a boss just cause i have to take a piss
[0:15:04] <+brightman42> P
[0:15:04] <rReizs> please just let me farm for the respec items, even if they are rare drops
[0:15:07] <%GustauveVIII> did ever button mash hard enough for Metal Gear Solid to trigger the torture autofire game over? a few speedrunners managed it
[0:15:08] <+TEANTACLES> pat you can pause the game by opening the help menu inside the normal menu
[0:15:09] <lyzejag> Sekiro's mod for accessibility (Slower gameplay among other things) was pretty good iirc
[0:15:11] <%Dakuu75> @ospreyworks On pc,  yeah
[0:15:20] <%earthboy2k> I just want a photo mode
[0:15:25] <%Valdorick> Go into inventory, then open the explanation element Kappa
[0:15:29] <%JoshManVGH> But then dog can pause you!
[0:15:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> that fucking sucks tho
[0:15:33] <%topendbuzza> YEAH SO
[0:15:36] <+Beetlewins> I'm playing Elden Ring on pc and was fighting godfrey and got him to one more hit then the game froze and locked up my entire computer.
[0:15:36] <+BoboDaHobo> you can pause by opening menu explanations
[0:15:37] <+TEANTACLES> lol
[0:15:37] <%Dakuu75> I need an auto-run toggle
[0:15:37] <%greasypete00> that also feels unintended
[0:15:39] <+InspectEIement> you can pause the game anytime by going to a menu explanation, it pauses the game in the background
[0:15:40] <+FirstFireKeeper> just quit
[0:15:41] <mrcelab> What about pvp
[0:15:41] <MechanizedGentleman> just die, then the game is paused
[0:15:42] <teflonbilly777> @boggsz12 I always felt SoulsBorne games never judged you for cheesing cause they were being such bastards to you in the game. Who didn't get teh Drake Sword in DS1?
[0:15:46] <%thecelticmaster> thecelticmaster subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hey Pat, just got back to Yakuza 7 after playing through the series! I kinda hate Nick now that I know Akiyama exists!
[0:15:47] <%Amadeusguy> that's hilarious
[0:15:47] <%Valdorick> A win is a win, and a Pause is a pause
[0:15:51] <+brightman42> watch them patch it
[0:15:52] <lyzejag> Is it going to be fixed ?????? it's so fucking weird
[0:15:58] <%VictorVonLouche> More studios should invest in adaptive difficulty tech, like how RE2R did it, on top of the difficulty choice. So if it detects you are struggling on something it'll throw you a bone when appropriate, without needing to go crazy on menu options.
[0:16:04] <HeroToxiko> it only works in singleplayer
[0:16:07] <Chaos_Aether> no
[0:16:09] <lyzejag> Yeye
[0:16:11] <yyyyfdugyu> you can pause the game by getting out the game 4Head
[0:16:13] <+Stormzcales_Lair> I'm assuming yes, but have you been introduced to the AFk farm yet ?
[0:16:15] <%CalderGaming> CalderGaming subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 31 months! 31 months dang. Having a great time watching the Elden Ring VODs now that I've built up enough of a buffer in my own game (currently level 87)! I thought I was going bleed, but man Hoarfrost Stomp ash of war has been putting in work too
[0:16:17] <@PrefectusCorgi> Wait for it
[0:16:18] <jubejube56> No
[0:16:18] <AlphaRayAllen> Maybe just an hour
[0:16:21] <%chiazam> This is about to be some horseshit
[0:16:21] <$Artoo__The_Me> Here comes the next hard drive article material
[0:16:21] <@Ranryu692> @FirstFireKeeper I shouldn't have to quit the game just because my dog is barking to be let in the room
[0:16:23] <AlphaRayAllen> Two
[0:16:26] <Grave_Titan_D> oh no
[0:16:29] <tanarath> Fucking use that shit & mod the game to make it universal for the start menu etc
[0:16:33] <peachy996> It is now an Elden Stream again
[0:16:35] <teflonbilly777> TOO SLOW PAT
[0:16:37] <+MarkoTolstov> I want a Bloodborne remake that gets the Demon's Souls treatment. It'll never happen buy a guy can dream.
[0:16:43] <%MonkeyTimelord> Dramatic pause.
[0:16:46] <%chiazam> Whenever Pat says “What if” he’s about to say something completely absurd
[0:16:46] <rommlll> hi big pat

[0:16:50] <rommlll> wow you are so big
[0:16:52] <+FirstFireKeeper> @FirstFireKeeper ok but just quit tho

[0:17:24] <%topendbuzza> no shut up tho
[0:17:25] <sirtommygunn> Revolutionary
[0:17:25] <Grave_Titan_D> no
[0:17:25] <lyzejag> WHAT THE FUCK
[0:17:26] <peachy996> Yeah that's when the pause is needed
[0:17:26] <teflonbilly777> Enjoy being backstabbed by an invader
[0:17:26] <%chiazam> REVOLUTIONARY
[0:17:29] <@QueequegTheater> HOWWWW
[0:17:31] <%Axellogic> reminds me how Nioh 2's pause menu is there but takes a couple presses
[0:17:32] <+TEANTACLES> switching gear mid-encounter wouldn't be as exciting
[0:17:32] <AlphaRayAllen> But that's casual!
[0:17:33] <@QueequegTheater> MY MIIIIIIND
[0:17:34] <$Artoo__The_Me> The hard drive articles write themselves
[0:17:36] <tanarath> Yeah, but no
[0:17:37] <%chiazam> A VISION THAT NO ONE COULD HAVE REALIZED
[0:17:38] <lyzejag> HOW CAN THIS BE
[0:17:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> GAME CHANGER
[0:17:39] <Grave_Titan_D> pat with these radical ideas
[0:17:39] <%NBUsagi> No Pat, according to Fromsoft players your whole life shoudl be put on hold just for this game and you should plan and set aside timso you can play un interupted
[0:17:41] <%zwolf42> even sekiro had a pause button
[0:17:41] <MechanizedGentleman> what if I want to open my menu without pausing, during combat?
[0:17:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> WOAH
[0:17:43] <@Lion_kun> PAT MAKING GAMES IS HARD
[0:17:44] <%chiazam> CALL MY AGENT
[0:17:44] <+FirstFireKeeper> die and get your souls back
[0:17:44] <HeroToxiko> YOU CAN'T BE LUL
[0:17:46] <ennui_on_me> but then you'd be able to switch equipment all willy nilly
[0:17:46] <@TheYellowcouch> No pause makes it REEEEEEALISTICCC
[0:17:47] <teflonbilly777> FUCKING CASUALS REEEEEEEEEEE
[0:17:49] <digaogrunge> But you cant change equipment while in combat if it is paused
[0:17:49] <@QueequegTheater> BUT IF PAUSE CEASES TO BE???
[0:17:49] <+twdlrr> TRADITION
[0:17:51] <TioXyco> it is not intentional tho
[0:17:53] <rommlll> wha?
[0:17:55] <yyyyfdugyu> its the dark souls of pause buttons
[0:17:56] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt why elden ring specificaly? the other games this was never a complaint
[0:17:57] <teflonbilly777> THEY BETTER PATCH THAT OUT!
[0:17:58] <%josnotforlewd> JESUS
[0:17:58] <%lightbringrrrr> because the menu is there for you to be able to hotswap shit
[0:17:59] <+Beetlewins> invasions can't even just happen in elden ring, they're entirely opt in
[0:17:59] <jumpyhugs> Who is driving? BEAR IS DRIVING!
[0:18:00] <lyzejag> NO BUT NO PAUSE BUTTON PAT
[0:18:01] <HeroToxiko> You can only be invaded after you summon somebody else
[0:18:01] <%topendbuzza> pat just wants an ez mode Kappa
[0:18:01] <sirtommygunn> They'll patch that pause out just to spite us
[0:18:05] <@Ranryu692> @FirstFireKeeper or they can make the game less shitty
[0:18:05] <jubejube56> True gamers press multiple inputs for their pause
[0:18:06] <%notsoy> sekiro has a fucking pause button, fromsoft needs to stop being dumb
[0:18:07] <lyzejag> BUT MEEEEEEEEE THO
[0:18:08] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt They're gonna patch it out before the PC version is stable
[0:18:10] <RemedyofRevenge> You can change equipment still I would suppose
[0:18:13] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt When You start the game, does it offer to play offline like BB?
[0:18:15] <+Talhee> Cool Skullface pat
[0:18:16] <spinningchurro> I had an ad can someone fill me in
[0:18:22] <@PrefectusCorgi> PAUSE IS YOU
[0:18:26] <teflonbilly777> Sekiro didn't have an Invasion mechanic
[0:18:27] <jubejube56> If you can’t input the dragon punch pause input then you don’t deserve the pause
[0:18:28] <+twdlrr> always forgo quality for the sake of tradition LUL
[0:18:29] <%Dregon_Azure> tutorial prompts as you play it also pause the game
[0:18:32] <%JD_Lars> JD_Lars subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! Hey Pat. Here’s a bad joke: Why aren’t depressed people worried about flat tires? They’re always carrying despair. Now go swing the sword good.
[0:18:37] <%Kevlar_Caviar> LUL
[0:18:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> ez
[0:18:38] <rommlll> wow
[0:18:38] <+TEANTACLES> One important thing to note: if you open the help menu while cooping or being invaded, the help menu no longer pauses the game
[0:18:40] <@QueequegTheater> @PrefectusCorgi BUT WHO WAS PAUSE
[0:18:42] <ennui_on_me> TO BE CONTINUED....
[0:18:43] <%chiazam> @queequegtheater will they even actually care/notice
[0:18:43] <%twistedj3ster> so fun fact about that
[0:18:44] <+Beetlewins> also it can't be too hard to take a paused game out of the invasion  pool until unpaused
[0:18:45] <greynob2> LUL
[0:18:45] <+Stormzcales_Lair> erlp
[0:18:46] <+brightman42> LUL
[0:18:48] <Omenaire_> shrodingers death
[0:18:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> Now what
[0:18:53] <HeroToxiko> @mrcelab you have to opt in to online, if you can use a horse you're in offline mode
[0:18:54] <%NBUsagi> Death pause
[0:18:57] <@QueequegTheater> Never unpause
[0:18:59] <ergulor> question can you do this while multiplayer?
[0:19:00] <Dio_TR> GAMBA
[0:19:01] <rommlll> Pat's mind "I am a genius"
[0:19:06] <sirtommygunn> but can you do that in a fight
[0:19:06] <greynob2> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:19:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> can you get invaded rn?
[0:19:08] <teflonbilly777> Everybody should invade Pat now
[0:19:11] <@PrefectusCorgi> LUL
[0:19:12] <digaogrunge> So...
[0:19:12] <%twistedj3ster> I quit out while inside a maiden, I loaded in inside the maiden

[0:19:22] <Grave_Titan_D> LUL
[0:19:24] <%cooljane3000> i want pat to accidentally discover an exploit with this example so bad rn
[0:19:25] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt now exit
[0:19:32] <@Ranryu692> and Demon's Souls had the photo mode pause as well
[0:19:37] <greynob2> get invaded
[0:19:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh this bug lol
[0:19:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> seriously what happens if there's another person in your session when you do this?
[0:19:42] <NewWillinium> Alright so what's happening now?
[0:19:44] <MaritimeSpanker> inb4 pat just gets banned
[0:19:45] <%topendbuzza> we about to make speedruns here
[0:19:47] <teflonbilly777> Pls let it corrupt the save for CHEATING
[0:19:50] <+trizetacannon44> Just do what Demons' Souls did with photo mode
[0:19:50] <Gray_LoFi> Your message got appraised while in the pause screen LUL
[0:19:52] <@QueequegTheater> @Ranryu692 DeSR was BluePoint, not Fromsoft
[0:19:57] <spinningchurro> @reallybigrocks probably just freezes you.
[0:20:07] <@Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 yeah, but it proves that it can be done
[0:20:08] <%SveriSageAdvice> shoutouts to the dude who tried to corrupt Pat's save lol
[0:20:08] <%Dakuu75> Save corrupted
[0:20:09] <%chiazam> wow
[0:20:12] <$Jaxnos> isn't this just the speedrun tech people use in ds3?
[0:20:16] <%JoshManVGH> BUT PAT THEY MIGHT BEAT BOSSSES IF PEOPLE CAN PAUSE!?
[0:20:17] <@TheYellowcouch> love when video games work like video games
[0:20:32] <teflonbilly777> Do it while getting invaded you coward
[0:20:34] <MaritimeSpanker> also pat
[0:20:34] <lyzejag> Sekiro's pause was pretty good, no problem in ANY situation. But no pause solo ? it's weird
[0:20:36] <Chaos_Aether> Does it just stop the game or you?
[0:20:38] <HeroToxiko> saves don't corrupt anymore, i've crashed enough times during autosaves to know that
[0:20:39] <+KorieTheCoward> i missed it what did Pat do?
[0:20:40] <%chiazam> Just abuse that shit who cares
[0:20:41] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I'm curious what happens if you turn off the game during that, would it corrupt the game?
[0:20:43] <MaritimeSpanker> you have finished Boc's quest as far as we know as of yesterday
[0:20:43] <%Kevlar_Caviar> yeah the pause shit is one of my few complaints about elden ring
[0:20:45] <%X2Eliah> eeeey its da pat
[0:20:46] <@QueequegTheater> *the save file?
[0:20:47] <%topendbuzza> gotta work for the pasue
[0:20:47] <spinningchurro> Pat please abuse it in multiplayer.
[0:20:48] <Chaos_Aether> ok
[0:20:56] <%JoshManVGH> Someone seriously tried to argue that pausing makes bosses easier, and I don't understand how...
[0:21:00] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt But if You stop while PVP, will you get banned?
[0:21:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> corrupt your save for science Pat
[0:21:03] <majindusto> PAUSE TECH
[0:21:06] <majindusto> lol
[0:21:08] <peachy996> surprised there haven't been balance patches yet to make everyone angry
[0:21:16] <Grave_Titan_D> but pat the difficulty
[0:21:19] <@QueequegTheater> @mrcelab They don't even ban actual hackers
[0:21:22] <clockworkidiot> it didn't in sekiro tho
[0:21:26] <%Valdorick> Pause Buffer to get perfect parries
[0:21:26] <$supermexicansentai> COME ON GUNGRAVE GORE RELEASE DATE

[0:21:40] <mrcelab> @mrcelab Thaaaaats weird
[0:21:44] <%topendbuzza> I can see a fast pause break ai's
[0:21:44] <teflonbilly777> We need to build bigger gates to keep the filthy casuals out
[0:21:47] <@goose_attack_almanac> goose_attack_almanac subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 59 months! Hey Pat. Was catching up on the podcasts and got to your and Woolie's conversation about morality systems in games. And it reminded me about Dragon Age 2. While the game was disappointing, I did prefer its take on Character morality and personality over the other games. Where party members develop different skills based on if they think you're a dick or not. And the Main Characters personality and tone are dictated by your dialogue choices. Game still makes me sad though. Sorry for all the text.
[0:21:48] <%chiazam> Huzzah
[0:21:50] <NitronStreams> Bloop
[0:21:50] <peachy996> The absolute state of play
[0:21:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> 13:37
[0:21:53] <@QueequegTheater> Bloodborne 2 never
[0:21:55] <@goose_attack_almanac> Good em
[0:21:58] <@PrefectusCorgi> Boop
[0:22:00] <+FirstFireKeeper> pause with melina would let me see which combo she is going into
[0:22:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> gamer time B)
[0:22:10] <@goose_attack_almanac> its a little silly
[0:22:10] <%ospreyworks> Who cares?
[0:22:11] <MaritimeSpanker> I hope we get a Sekiro 2 sometime
[0:22:14] <peachy996> MGS1 Remaster never
[0:22:19] <MaritimeSpanker> though that would depend on activision I guess
[0:22:21] <peachy996> SH1 remaster never
[0:22:22] <spinningchurro> Anyone else think Elden Ring will not have DLC?
[0:22:30] <jubejube56> Elden ring blood borne expansion with a monster hunter crossover
[0:22:30] <peachy996> Good game never
[0:22:31] <GhoulishCripple> I thought if you could pause via the menu screen using items to heal becomes an issue
[0:22:35] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Bane_Kaikyo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! Yo, my laptop finally got back the other day so I've been all up in that Elden Russy. Might be a week or so later than most folks, but better late than never, especially when the game is this GOOD. Keep on Keepin on Pat
[0:22:38] <+Beetlewins> Not even sure why the pausing discourse got co opted into the general difficulty discourse. I always thought the argument around pausing was more to do with Souls games being online games.
[0:22:39] <teflonbilly777> I just don't want all these new malingerers to be able to enjoy these games
[0:22:40] <HeroToxiko> @mrcelab pvp is a player only thing this isn't street fighter LUL
[0:22:43] <Grave_Titan_D> game never
[0:22:43] <%topendbuzza> did you know pausing breaks MK64 lap timer?
[0:22:45] <%Valdorick> You can add QoL features and still keep the spirit of the game.
[0:22:50] <deviljhojho_> sekiros whole message is lie cheat and steal to win anyways
[0:22:54] <%D00msDayDan> add hard mode

[0:23:17] <lockhead45> What actual games are we expecting from Sony again apart from Ragnarok? i've been totally out of anything PS
[0:23:17] <NitronStreams> LUL
[0:23:17] <%JoshManVGH> I can see how that makes sense in some games, but some of these Elden things are so fucking fast. Ulcerated Tree Spirit is still going to blast my ass with fire when I unpause.

[0:23:23] <+Mrbaconator> i think it should be called easy and normal
[0:23:28] <Zourath> Pause button, but there's a 1/1000 chance that the pause menu is actually a mimic.
[0:23:35] <Darren716> The best is Alien Soldier, Very easy and very hard
[0:23:37] <+Mrbaconator> that works too
[0:23:39] <HeroToxiko> heh yeah
[0:23:40] <+FirstFireKeeper> EZ Japanese devs care not for your UX
[0:23:41] <@TheYellowcouch> When will DMC remove the pause button so hell and hell can be actually difficult
[0:23:47] <teflonbilly777> Easy Operation anyone?

[0:24:05] <Omenaire_> good thing it will never happen
[0:24:06] <%Kevlar_Caviar> NG-
[0:24:08] <NitronStreams> they should just name the modes "Noob" and "Tryhard"
[0:24:10] <%NBUsagi> Nah i get that
[0:24:10] <HeroToxiko> @VictorVonLouche that is always on by default
[0:24:10] <UnderpaidBob> New Game minus LUL
[0:24:13] <GhoulishCripple> I still agree with Miyazaki as to why he makes his games without a difficulty selector. he forces everyone to face the same obstacles so the conversation about the game isn't destroyed by difficulty based arguments
[0:24:18] <@QueequegTheater> NG- Kappa
[0:24:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> How about Assisted you just dont lose runes on death
[0:24:26] <%Dakuu75> @underpaidbob Lol
[0:24:35] <modsformeandyou> Has Pat finished Elden Ring?
[0:24:37] <iosephe> yup

[0:24:41] <Zebroneath> insufferable
[0:24:46] <Ghufufin> gatekeeping extreme
[0:24:48] <sirtommygunn> those guys are always mad though
[0:24:50] <%Kevlar_Caviar> implying they aren't ALREADY doing it with elden ring LUL

[0:24:53] <@QueequegTheater> I sure will
[0:24:53] <%NBUsagi> Honestly the game would be made significantly easeier if you just didnt loose your resources on death

[0:25:05] <mrcelab> Not easy or hard, just OFFLINE mode, that doesnt give You the pvp items or encounters AT ALL in entire game! FIXED!
[0:25:06] <+machshop> then don't play easy mode
[0:25:06] <greynob2> NotLikeThis
[0:25:07] <GhoulishCripple> that is literally why Miyazaki didn't make difficulties pat. there is an interview where he said that

[0:25:32] <Chaos_Aether> or
[0:25:33] <teflonbilly777> @richardlikespies Square is sitting on those rights and the creator is busy with Xenoblade Chronicles. Neve rgonna happen
[0:25:35] <%MisterRockett> Easy Dark Souls is just gonna make people realize the combat isn't good.
[0:25:37] <+machshop> i will cheese and break every game because it's fun, i don't care about the intended experience
[0:25:38] <UnderpaidBob> I hate people who think you can't "experience" a Fromsoft game without doing a no hit run
[0:25:40] <megaman_sentinel> ppl r dumb
[0:25:44] <Majin_Kuum> Wolfenstein 2 had like nine difficulty modes
[0:25:46] <+Rofiarf> what if the difference is just 5% or something?
[0:25:47] <%topendbuzza> OH GOD NO
[0:25:48] <teflonbilly777> HE IS A BAD PERSON

[0:26:02] <modsformeandyou> The summons should be balanced though. The fact that they can solo bosses is too crazy
[0:26:03] <+Beetlewins> An easy mode where at the end a video of Miyazaki comes on and says "congratulations you won the game as it was intended to be played."
[0:26:03] <%ospreyworks> NFT Freakman Esq.

[0:26:11] <%Maids4lyfe> his name deserves to be forgotten
[0:26:13] <peachy996> I miss the old difficulty to Doom Eternal's first DLC
[0:26:14] <devanmuse> Does anybody even talk about NFTs anymore?
[0:26:16] <drinkmilkstrongbones> I wrote it, beat me up
[0:26:16] <GhoulishCripple> poor Dean. beat by a cuphead
[0:26:18] <%abakkus> buh buh wuh buh buht if the Unworthy can play by big boy pants big boy game it will make my pp shrink !!
[0:26:18] <ReiDuran> It's almost like designing a game is really really fucking hard and changing even damage values could completely and utterly ruin the experience VERY EASILY.
[0:26:19] <%Breaknoon> Junya Takahashi on my
[0:26:19] <%zwolf42> i can't even believe how bad that dude was at cuphead
[0:26:20] <HeroToxiko> @Amadeusguy ye
[0:26:23] <%redgraverr> Like Tim Roger's said, they should add a I get it button when it comes to souls game.
[0:26:25] <+supersonic21> low key hoping for yakuza 8
[0:26:29] <lyzejag> Isn't he a finance guy or whatever ? Not really a game guy
[0:26:33] <UnderpaidBob> I'm doing a sorcery build that trivializes most bosses and I'm having a great time with Elden Ring
[0:26:34] <NitronStreams> my easy mode is too easy, normal mode is too hard game was "Furi"
[0:26:35] <teflonbilly777> @Maids4lyfe Oh no, A video of his failure should be on his headstone
[0:26:39] <%VictorVonLouche> I hate difficulty choices because what if easy is too easy? Or hard is too hard and normal is to easy/hard. lol Could do with extra info when selecting those options.
[0:26:43] <@MistyMntns> Sometimes I like to play a game on easy mode because I love the story.
[0:26:49] <%Dakuu75> Im shocked that dude cam get ANY work, after a fuck up like that cuphead tutorial shit
[0:26:57] <+Walopoh> the same journalist that made the infamous cuphead tutorial gameplay video now tweets about NFTs being the next step in video games...
[0:26:57] <digaogrunge> An ingame solution like the Covenant of Champions in DS2 is the best approach imo
[0:26:58] <deviljhojho_> i member
[0:27:00] <%topendbuzza> that's why we love you pat
[0:27:02] <%AdamElJefe> @ReiDuran as a game designer, this, 1000% this
[0:27:04] <%Maids4lyfe> @teflonbilly777 you have a good point
[0:27:07] <@QueequegTheater> @VictorVonLouche Halo did it the best, Heroic is noted as the developer-intended difficulty
[0:27:10] <RemedyofRevenge> Thats exactly what I'm talking about. If they didnt like it and don't talk about how much they hated it, then there is never a problem
[0:27:14] <HeroToxiko> im currently doing this thing where i try to activate the red finger questline and the red finger hunter questline since they don't actually interact, i love it
[0:27:15] <majindusto> Big Baby Butthurt
[0:27:29] <%topendbuzza> oh boy
[0:27:34] <+machshop> yes LUL
[0:27:39] <%JoshManVGH> Ooooh showing their whole ass
[0:27:39] <+supersonic21> and the avengers dev in the middle
[0:27:41] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt That Vader comic has the quote "You are just a child, and I am well-accustomed to killing children", it goes so fucking hard
[0:27:44] <teflonbilly777> All those UX/UI guys are failures
[0:27:49] <%josnotforlewd> Reminder that Elden Ring doesn't have cop chases and therefore is bad
[0:27:50] <digaogrunge> When did UI became UX?
[0:27:53] <GhoulishCripple> you forgot the Avengers by Squeenix dev who said Elden ring has performance issues
[0:27:53] <peachy996> I don't get how the UX is a problem
[0:27:55] <majindusto> They were So Salty lol
[0:27:56] <ReiDuran> The best thing is seeing the mockup Elden Ring joke UI redesigns
[0:27:56] <teflonbilly777> And Rami whatshisface
[0:27:57] <%Dakuu75> …
[0:27:57] <%X2Eliah> yup
[0:28:00] <%twistedj3ster> It kinda sucks because I like Horizon as well as ER
[0:28:02] <+tempestzephyr> seems very unprofessional
[0:28:02] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Are these setting On or Off?" Kappa
[0:28:04] <MechanizedGentleman> what does UX mean?
[0:28:06] <%JGardner03> JGardner03 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! Hey I actually believe I passed you on Elden Ring progress so I can watch the streams live once again, unless of course Pat discovers some super hidden boss
[0:28:09] <justindykes16> What is UX? Sorry Im dumb lol
[0:28:11] <teflonbilly777> @digaogrunge User Interface and User Experience
[0:28:15] <Darren716> UI isn't UX
[0:28:17] <jubejube56> User experience?
[0:28:17] <LorcaNomad> UI is not UX and anyone who says otherwise is wrong
[0:28:21] <+Beetlewins> Hot take but Elden Ring UX could be better! There is no reason that you can't find out what an ash of war does on the equip screen
[0:28:21] <%d1stantutopia> d1stantutopia subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 28 month streak! Happy 28 months Pat. Holy shit, Elden Ring is great; running a pure Faith build with the Cipher Pata and it rules, but grape lady's questline is bugged and now I'm sad.
[0:28:24] <simifu> BOTW pro mode Kreygasm
[0:28:29] <Darren716> But the UX isn't good in 2042 regardless
[0:28:30] <@QueequegTheater> THEY LOOK THE SAME
[0:28:31] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> "user experience"
[0:28:33] <%zwolf42> Battlefield 2042 was so broken it's incredible.
[0:28:35] <@QueequegTheater> THEY'RE OFF-FUL
[0:28:36] <%generalve> I hope future open world DONT DO what BOTW and ER does. map markers all the way
[0:28:37] <Astrophizz> yeah they changed the UI from those screenshots
[0:28:38] <%JoshManVGH> The characters are what are carrying the quests, not the actions themselves. It's the reverse in Elden Ring... kinda, personally, I like some of the chatacters and want to see how their shit ends.
[0:28:39] <%the_fn_blaze> It just comes across as petty
[0:28:40] <+2DSuperiority> damn, this game isn't copy pasting like I do
[0:28:40] <+supersonic21> the hardest thing to do is do a UI that gives you enough info but has less then like 3 elments on screen
[0:28:45] <+MarkoTolstov> The User Interfce
[0:28:48] <%twistedj3ster> yeah, the Pat meter
[0:28:55] <rottingpastry> User Experience
[0:28:56] <@MistyMntns> And Emojis!
[0:28:57] <tanarath> Streamfeel
[0:28:59] <+MarkoTolstov> User Experience
[0:29:02] <digaogrunge> @digaogrunge Sure, but I'm talking about when did those became interchangeble?
[0:29:02] <GhoulishCripple> the Pat Index
[0:29:04] <radda343> the only bad part about elden ring's ui is the status icons having no explanation, but it's like check your fuckin talismans it's not hard
[0:29:07] <teflonbilly777> Mouthfeel
[0:29:08] <%Bluwizard21> pat has shitty ux
[0:29:08] <+supersonic21> pat:become small
[0:29:10] <%Dakuu75> Oh
[0:29:11] <%abakkus> i see those sorts of tweets and all i can think is like. "games having an easy mode is bad!" says guy who also thinks ui is bad if it doesn't hold your hand for literally everything at all times
[0:29:11] <tanarath> Like mouthfeel for food.
[0:29:20] <Grave_Titan_D> smol pat
[0:29:20] <%lightbringrrrr> and chat is part of the UX whereas that's not in the UI
[0:29:20] <@QueequegTheater> This stream has worse UX than Elden Ring Kappa
[0:29:27] <%generalve> MAP MARKERS ARE GOOD
[0:29:29] <Astrophizz> no subtitle/text customization
[0:29:31] <%SpontaneousC> causal reminder that the person in that thread who tried to dunk on elden rings pc performance makes bad pc ports for a living
[0:29:35] <%twistedj3ster> I just ignore them
[0:29:36] <peachy996> I do like how some devs got a little salty about someone else's game. It's like Cookie man dunking on every Tekken game from 1-5
[0:29:38] <+FirstFireKeeper> literally everything about a game is UX
[0:29:41] <%Dakuu75> Yeah
[0:29:42] <GhoulishCripple> status Icons always suck in From games. none of them really explain what the buff it represents is
[0:29:44] <lyzejag> You can figure *some* icons, but fuck it's hard to guess lmao
[0:29:45] <+678saintglock> how about people being just incensed because it took an extra 5 seconds to realize that you have to press the back button to exit the map instead of pressing the same button
[0:29:47] <+brightman42> and you can have like a dozen of them sometimes
[0:29:50] <%chiazam> I can’t tell what I’m getting icons for
[0:29:51] <Darren716> I still don't know what the blue slab means that shows up sometimes
[0:29:51] <megaman_sentinel> pat the weather man
[0:29:53] <@QueequegTheater> OH, OF COURSE, THE RED SQUARE MEANS BAD.  LIKE ALL THESE OTHER COLORED SQUARED
[0:29:53] <Ashecroft> Spent the last 30+ hours struggling to enjoy Elden Ring, and I just cant get the groove to do so ;_;
[0:29:56] <%Maids4lyfe> lmao
[0:29:57] <sirtommygunn> Bleed, Stone and Poison are the only ones I ever figure out
[0:29:57] <Giggalith> And having to claw to swap spells/items in combat
[0:29:58] <Astrophizz> Nixxes makes good ports...
[0:29:59] <+richardlikespies> Elden gift
[0:29:59] <+supersonic21> i have a really good feeling about this month if elden ring is already this good and triangle stratgey was REALLY damn good too
[0:30:00] <+Beetlewins> Go equip a new ash of war on your weapon and try and find out what it does on that screen
[0:30:00] <tanarath> Btw, Horizon forbidden west allows you to turn off a bunch of quest/collectable icons if you just want to wander & discover.
[0:30:01] <%abakkus> i fear they doth protest too much
[0:30:01] <+Walopoh> it's projection all the way down
[0:30:02] <+MarkoTolstov> i NEED to see this thread
[0:30:05] <rReizs> the scroll with the grace and an X symbol means you can't teleport, figured that out after a while
[0:30:05] <teflonbilly777> Imagine if Fez was a "guided experience"
[0:30:11] <%TheAdMerlin> There was one post in one of the screencaps you retweeted where one was openly xenophobic to Japanese games too
[0:30:12] <deviljhojho_> just beat radahn in two tries lads
[0:30:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ye
[0:30:13] <rottingpastry> @678saintglock Shit still annoys me lol
[0:30:14] <+LandOfTheWay> elden ring's UX isn't even perfect, but boy are the people in that thread full of it
[0:30:15] <deviljhojho_> finally
[0:30:18] <tanarath> It's not Elden Ring, but it's a decent game.
[0:30:18] <Ghufufin> a complete and total lack of self awareness is a magical thing
[0:30:18] <%zwolf42> I wish Elden Ring listed the % of a buff or debuff on item descriptions.
[0:30:19] <+Walopoh> FEZ LUL
[0:30:19] <modsformeandyou> I haven't used any summons in Elden Ring and most bosses have taken 1-3 tries. Next is Rhadan. I've tried him 13 times so far, got him to 50% health.
[0:30:25] <peachy996> Hey Pat what are Itagaki's 5 least favorite games?
[0:30:25] <%chiazam> I dunno why Rami Esmail was there, that guy is usually cool
[0:30:26] <ReiDuran> Yeah I was wondering what the fuck those icons in Elden Ring were

[0:31:04] <%twistedj3ster> OH HE'S GOIN' IN
[0:31:07] <sirtommygunn> Fez is a game that appears to be good but the deeper you get into it the more it reveals that it's a trap to waste your fucking time

[0:31:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> What's Fez?

[0:31:29] <sirtommygunn> He's also the guy who made The Witness, right? The best game you should never play imo
[0:31:33] <%AdamElJefe> yuuuuuuuuup
[0:31:37] <Darren716> That is all I wanted out of Fez, just give me Super Paper Mario stuff

[0:33:22] <%generalve> who's more hacky pat ? David cage or Phil fish ?
[0:33:24] <%alcors_wisdom> Ah yeah I remember teaching all my friends pig latin in grade school thought we were sly
[0:33:29] <@QueequegTheater> @Ashecroft I recommend finding a weapon you think is cool.  Forget moonveil, that shit's a meme.  PvP weirdos forcing a meta is cringe, and experienced players know that.  Just find a weapon or spell you like and build around it, not the other way around.
[0:33:30] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Oh, we're shitting on Fez lol
[0:33:30] <%JoshManVGH> The Eeemoootions!

[0:33:41] <teflonbilly777> Remember when Phil Fish said Japanese games were bad

[0:33:44] <%the_fn_blaze> I had to take notes for LA noire
[0:33:45] <digaogrunge> Phil worked on a VR game after Fez, it was cool, I guess?

[0:33:48] <+pugszerosugar> Cubussy

[0:33:49] <+healnavi> qr code puzzle mao

[0:33:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> How long is this gonna be
[0:33:55] <@QueequegTheater> @Ashecroft At the end of the day, maybe you just don't like the combat, and that's fine
[0:33:55] <sirtommygunn> hacky =/= shitty
[0:33:56] <+LandOfTheWay> striking while the iron is sub-zero, but you're right
[0:33:56] <%topendbuzza> fish is a hack cage is a creep
[0:33:57] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't buy that

[0:34:02] <@QueequegTheater> Cage is a worse person
[0:34:02] <majindusto> PHIL  IS WORSE
[0:34:03] <+CrabStealer> Did he?
[0:34:03] <fatalDestiny> David cage knows what he want's, he just has shit taste.
[0:34:04] <+Roundelay11> god I haven't thought of Phil in years
[0:34:04] <peachy996> Eh
[0:34:04] <TheotherKristian> What about the director of bioshock?
[0:34:05] <bigshedman> No but Pat, it's super deep! You gotta find out the phrase "the lazy dog jumps over the brown fox" to figure out the secret language. A phrase that ONLY EXISTS IN ENGLISH so fuck everyone who speaks a different language I guess.
[0:34:06] <+brightman42> didn't fish at least quit
[0:34:06] <+supersonic21> i want some more games like the witness
[0:34:06] <%NovaKnightmare> Phil Fish be like "I haf 12 Matchstick"
[0:34:07] <%TheAdMerlin> David Cage is a scum bag and horrific person, Phil Fish is a hack and just a dick
[0:34:08] <+supersonic21> i loved that game
[0:34:08] <@QueequegTheater> But Fish is a fucking hack
[0:34:09] <%Dakuu75> Wow really? God damn
[0:34:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> 20 minutes
[0:34:09] <peachy996> Phil made one game right?
[0:34:10] <BurdRightsActivist> I still think the fact Judas in Binding of Isaac wears a Fez is a direct jab at old Phil 4Head
[0:34:10] <+InspectEIement> indie game the movie is so funny
[0:34:10] <digaogrunge> CAGE FOOLED YOU THEN
[0:34:10] <+MelodyMedley> There was an attempt

[0:34:12] <teflonbilly777> @cooljane3000 Passionate about sexual assault scenes
[0:34:14] <%captain_thickthighs> Wait people from Montreal are human?
[0:34:15] <ennui_on_me> @teflonbilly777 That was a fairly popular perspective at the time, and I think Phil Fish saying that singlehandedly killed it off
[0:34:15] <%twistedj3ster> I'll say one thing for Omikron, it was ambitious for it's time
[0:34:15] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> who is the worse person though?
[0:34:16] <+twdlrr> Fish fuckin' LOVES his fart smell
[0:34:16] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @QueequegTheater I found a Faith straight sword in a secret area that I'm pretty sure is dogshit, but I LOVE the way it looks.
[0:34:16] <%NBUsagi> David Cage: passionate, creative, racist, sexist, homophobic, game designer
[0:34:18] <peachy996> Cage keeps attempting to make a good game

[0:34:25] <%josnotforlewd> He's criminally stoopid
[0:34:25] <%Valdorick> Cage cried out of the court room and is still making games, Phil got a negative review and QUIT GAMING
[0:34:27] <%HotMafia81> Cage also persisted in his craft and at least got a little better.

[0:42:12] <+toastybites> I thought I saw Vincent for a second
[0:42:12] <Firemahci> lmao that music
[0:42:13] <Nupinoop296> this looks pretty cool
[0:42:13] <ebrion> if adblock is on, twitch has been chugging and auto changing to 480p
[0:42:15] <dan_g_v> mute stream?
[0:42:16] <%Brassnarwhal> new elden ring trailer?
[0:42:17] <%orbulon> gampley looks ok
[0:42:19] <%tusk102> this looks... alright
[0:42:20] <$Futurecity10> this games gonna suck
[0:42:20] <+supersonic21> its hard to be hype for a game that just got a 5 month delay
[0:42:21] <peachy996> It's always crappy music too
[0:42:21] <+MosesUnspoken> Kinda looks sick
[0:42:22] <Big_Dream> this looks cool
[0:42:24] <%JoshManVGH> I will still play this, it looks neat
[0:42:25] <%earthboy2k> luminous engine LUL
[0:42:25] <rottingpastry> Forspoken West
[0:42:26] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I think the low fps its on the demo
[0:42:28] <Captain_matt> this gameplay actually looks sick though
[0:42:28] <%Breaknoon> VOOOM
[0:42:29] <@QueequegTheater> @CopperTucker I would rather have more GOOD PoC protags
[0:42:30] <+DrFacilier> looks better than Stranger of Paradise
[0:42:30] <Thesomeone96> ye
[0:42:32] <%baronouroboros> Stranger of Chaos: Final Chaos Fantasy
[0:42:32] <%generalve> yes
[0:42:32] <MechanizedGentleman> this game looks cool though
[0:42:32] <reonome> yes
[0:42:33] <sirtommygunn> no longer bothering to mute when they do this shit?
[0:42:33] <iosephe> yup
[0:42:33] <%Valdorick> @CopperTucker I mean, I somehow doubt that if it fails it'll be blamed on the protag...
[0:42:34] <dan_g_v> oh, I thought it was an actual song
[0:42:34] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> is it just me or does this game just look like a glorified tech demo
[0:42:34] <$0ddeye> Game looks super fun but the dialogue is cringe
[0:42:34] <+InspectEIement> nah
[0:42:35] <+trizetacannon44> Yep
[0:42:35] <Solidnick18> yep
[0:42:35] <majindusto> Yes
[0:42:35] <AllenDeadman> yeah
[0:42:36] <teflonbilly777> Yeah, till October
[0:42:36] <+azraith> October I think

[0:42:37] <%orbulon> Like october right
[0:42:37] <Ghufufin> huh a witch character action game, thats a cool and original idea
[0:42:38] <Sporkgasm> yeah
[0:42:39] <+OneGorillionDollars> yes LUL
[0:42:39] <GhoulishCripple> I saw in a gameplay demo you don't even have to fight enemies in Forspoken you can run past them to open the chests they guard
[0:42:39] <%josnotforlewd> OH SHIT DID IT?
[0:42:39] <+Roundelay11> Something about this game is just odd
[0:42:39] <froglorn> The movement looks pretty fun
[0:42:40] <%SpontaneousC> this game got big delay
[0:42:40] <%StarOtter70> That ice water skating thing was cool
[0:42:40] <+choopercabra> I don't know about you guys, I think it looks fine.
[0:42:40] <%ElMaestroChoque> this looks like itll be forgotten
[0:42:41] <peachy996> Is it too much to ask for the music to not suck ass?
[0:42:41] <+healnavi> basically
[0:42:42] <Solidnick18> Till october
[0:42:44] <+InspectEIement> nvm im wrong
[0:42:45] <17sevens> all i want is that one gag where the studio drags the development files into the bin live on stream
[0:42:45] <%The_Protagonist> the game honestly looks pretty good, the writing is abysmal
[0:42:45] <+Walopoh> this music sucks and doesn't match at all
[0:42:45] <eristhanewood> Not really no
[0:42:46] <%BlackMage66652> Dino Crisis has been skinned and placed on the body of a GaaS. Bet on it.  Cheer500
[0:42:47] <28moogles> It's nothing like that?
[0:42:47] <raknikmik> Yeah thankfully
[0:42:48] <%Das_Prints> Hope this is good. Looks cool.
[0:42:48] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah, it's also like all FF15 people isnt it?
[0:42:48] <DanThePumpkinman> Yeah, the game with female POC main character and no female POC in the writing directing or producing staff. yeah. seems cool.
[0:42:49] <bigshedman> This game looks cool and also all of the shit I hate, including snarky writing and voice acting and unrelated music
[0:42:49] <tanarath> It needs twice that, then.
[0:42:49] <MaritimeSpanker> "she will rise"
[0:42:49] <+TEANTACLES> it's what agni's philosophy turned into. the writing is by amy hennig and gary whitta
[0:42:49] <+griffball13> She will rise
[0:42:50] <MaritimeSpanker> cringe
[0:42:51] <%gitgouda> @Captain_matt what gameplay?
[0:42:53] <%HotMafia81> That's why she said "Let's finish this"
[0:42:54] <%DovaDude29> The hell is this game supposed to be even? Like, what is this
[0:42:56] <deviljhojho_> its an isekai
[0:42:57] <NewWillinium> I need to know how it *feels* to move and fight in that game
[0:42:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> wowwowow
[0:42:58] <nodankya> rise up
[0:43:00] <+TEANTACLES> writing is kind of cringe but the gameplay looks sick

[0:47:23] <%jamsbybetty> if it runs at 60 then it's worth picking up lmao
[0:47:24] <Cyan_Dream> It only took 2 generations to get a solid framerate... maybe.
[0:47:25] <%Brassnarwhal> is this one worse?
[0:47:26] <+MosesUnspoken> I know who most who these characters are now.

[0:48:44] <pillowwasp> Cool
[0:48:44] <rottingpastry> No, they haven't.
[0:48:44] <AstrodropGaming> Nope
[0:48:45] <%greasypete00> probably not
[0:48:46] <%earthboy2k> no they got bored
[0:48:46] <%Breaknoon> they're all western lol

[0:48:48] <iosephe> no
[0:48:49] <%tusk102> they havent

[0:48:52] <+InspectEIement> they think BW + borders
[0:48:54] <TopTierHarley> they saw clips
[0:48:54] <IvanMistwalker> nope
[0:48:54] <HeroToxiko> Magic?
[0:48:55] <@QueequegTheater> NO BUT MAKE IT DARK THOOOO
[0:48:55] <%josnotforlewd> video games are hard
[0:48:57] <+The_EL_Destino> no
[0:48:57] <%The_Protagonist> this lighting is awful
[0:48:58] <Daxalog> They googled a photo
[0:48:58] <+CrabStealer> They spent 5 minutes in google images
[0:48:58] <phatmac16> No
[0:49:00] <peachy996> This reminds me of that one part in The Matrix: Path of Neo
[0:49:00] <%Brassnarwhal> have they ever played a game in black and white? cause i find it offensive to my eyes after a while
[0:49:07] <+supersonic21> i mean this looks good
[0:49:07] <sirtommygunn> yeah looks like a normal game with the color removed
[0:49:08] <%Das_Prints> Ah I remember Devolver showing this off a while back
[0:49:08] <galko_chan1> its hurting my eyes WutFace
[0:49:09] <%TheGuesty> FrankMiller did Black and White well
[0:49:09] <Captain_matt> SPIKE that contrast bys
[0:49:10] <%Maids4lyfe> no
[0:49:11] <%NBUsagi> Save money on color
[0:49:12] <LorcaNomad> black and white is not greyscale for fucks sake
[0:49:13] <deviljhojho_> maybe they watched kurosawa, but only ran
[0:49:13] <Daxalog> 1 or 0
[0:49:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> just slap a monochrome filter over it, its basically the same thing
[0:49:14] <jumpyhugs> just fuck with your tv's contrast
[0:49:17] <+Modern_Myth> Yep you’re right
[0:49:18] <%Brassnarwhal> make it starker it's not stark enough
[0:49:19] <%gitgouda> facts
[0:49:20] <+TheMilkiestShake> Black and white usually means you have to focus more on colours
[0:49:20] <%greasypete00> sekiro: shadows die 2d
[0:49:22] <@QueequegTheater> CONTRAST 100000
[0:49:22] <Capn_Bilge> but pat that would require actual art design and not just a desaturation filter
[0:49:22] <NewWillinium> How was the Kurosawa filter in Ghost of Tsushima?
[0:49:25] <pillowwasp> True
[0:49:27] <%tusk102> just fuck with the contrast a bit
[0:49:27] <%HotMafia81> Some of the indoor stuff looks okay
[0:49:28] <%Maids4lyfe> black and white film was grey WTF are you talking about?
[0:49:28] <stote44> pruince of pursha
[0:49:30] <HeroToxiko> SourPls
[0:49:30] <+Catpurnicus> the problem is they have probably never watched black and white cinema aside from a couple kurasawa film clips
[0:49:31] <spinningchurro> Watch there be a color mode that makes it 10x better.
[0:49:33] <@QueequegTheater> @NewWillinium ehh
[0:49:34] <%AkronymCLT> I feel like the part they always miss is that old film stock needed a shit ton of light to expose
[0:49:35] <ennui_on_me> Ran is fucking incredible
[0:49:36] <Calamity2007> Woolie game
[0:49:37] <jubejube56> It’s grey therefore my game is citizen kane
[0:49:37] <%generalve> @patstaresat LIGHTHOUSE movie is B/W done well
[0:49:38] <phatmac16> Can we get a non black and white mode
[0:49:39] <+condemned_15> People need to watch "Ran"
[0:49:40] <levanluhh> Ran is top tier Kurosawa
[0:49:41] <Lieutori> Akio Otsuka though
[0:49:43] <Sporkgasm> yeah but they didn't watch those either
[0:49:43] <reonome> devolver??

[0:49:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> DEVOLVER

[0:49:46] <%notsoy> oh hey Akio otsuka
[0:49:47] <majindusto> AKIO
[0:49:47] <+Walopoh> I hope that's something that can still be fixed in this game's development
[0:49:48] <%barrakuta371> I don't know any of these people
[0:49:48] <some_brave_apollo> Ran is probably his best looking
[0:49:48] <radda343> GOTO?!
[0:49:49] <@Fuggins4U> Goto? the wrestler?

[1:03:38] <+VexicBayn> Max is just a nice guy having a good time
[1:03:39] <%shurtal> Why is the Z axis SO THREATENING in the game!?!?!?

[1:03:51] <teflonbilly777> REMEMBER YOUR DISCO ELYSIUM PLAYTHROUGH?
[1:03:52] <%Brassnarwhal> but he's too cynical to say the word
[1:03:52] <+tsamxxx> quadraped quandary
[1:03:55] <%topendbuzza> those last 2 games were so ugly tho
[1:03:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> Spoken like a true optimist
[1:03:56] <%Daskolin> You are Souls proteg?
[1:03:58] <+thickshield> absurdist?
[1:03:58] <greynob2> vid and sound out of sync or is it just me
[1:03:58] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Yeah. and Pat is like Oscar the Grouch. we love him and all his trash
[1:04:01] <+Beetlewins> Look after announcing a Front Mission remake Square have nowhere else to go
[1:04:01] <+izanagi22> Square showing FOUR games and none of them being XVI is rough
[1:04:02] <Ashecroft> @PatStaresAt So pretty much Jojo just now?
[1:04:04] <+Pendlez> and sometimes you're super right like with elden ring
[1:04:06] <%StarOtter70> @Minorou geefIQ
[1:04:06] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I don't care what games Square announces unless it's Final Fantasy or a Legacy of Kain revival
[1:04:07] <%Mendacii> pats cynic nature keeps my ass grounded
[1:04:07] <%Brassnarwhal> that's why you're cynical
[1:04:11] <+griffball13> get that postivity out of here
[1:04:13] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> you gotta have those moments of hope to make the hurt so much more beautiful
[1:04:13] <$vehementvadr> pessimistic patters
[1:04:15] <%tetraes> well u were right about Elden Ring being good
[1:04:18] <+Maxo_Stream> Tyrannosaurus Wreckage

[1:04:38] <teflonbilly777> LITERALLY JOSUKE
[1:04:45] <+griffball13> if you are cynical you are never disapointed
[1:04:50] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> the terrible netcode is also to replicate the experience
[1:04:53] <@QueequegTheater> And the idea for invasions came to him when broke into a random house and threw shit at the owners Kappa
[1:04:53] <%CalderGaming> OH MY GOD
[1:04:56] <%NBUsagi> Good people be like that sometimes
[1:04:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> what a story
[1:05:01] <%Nobrev> ah yes the part 4
[1:05:01] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> that's life in the country too
[1:05:06] <HeroToxiko> And his hair is based on theirs
[1:05:07] <%CalderGaming> is that why the turtles
[1:05:09] <%TheAdMerlin> Miyazaki lucked upon some random Canadians
[1:05:10] <%ScreamLord> Jolly Cooperation
[1:05:11] <$zyberion626> what inspired the poison swamps? @PatStaresAt
[1:05:14] <Saturation_Lizard> so whats the explanation for the invasions then
[1:05:16] <%spitelite> did they have pompadours
[1:05:16] <bigshedman> IS that why Miyzaki has that weird haircut?
[1:05:16] <dan_g_v> @QueequegTheater sounds legit
[1:05:21] <+Beetlewins> did he try finger but hole?
[1:05:22] <teflonbilly777> @CalderGaming Oh shit!
[1:05:22] <+Pendlez> araki didn't forget he just told miyazaki
[1:05:24] <BinaryShuffle> The netcode is from part 5 though
[1:05:24] <%sniffy77> You see the important part is the strangers immediately gtfo after they helped.
[1:05:25] <+aaymon86> You mean every interaction with another human being ever?
[1:05:29] <DancesWitBalrog> Another 30fps Jojo game...

[1:05:37] <%ScreamLord> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[1:05:38] <+Pendlez> invasions are because some dude slashed his tires and then left
[1:05:40] <+Beetlewins> elmo
[1:05:45] <jubejube56> Ah yes and the snow was the first poisoned swamp
[1:05:46] <%Wallabri> psaWink psaWink psaWink
[1:05:49] <%BlackMage66652> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[1:05:50] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt I just discovered a crazy Incantation combo. If you use Dragonice then hit the enemy with a fire spell after you proc Frostbite, the status immediately wears off and can proc it again.
[1:05:51] <theghosttcatt> smellmoooo
[1:05:53] <megaman_sentinel> Elmo put that away
[1:06:08] <@QueequegTheater> I'll just get the alliance raid rewards
[1:06:09] <%hewlettfan96> Pat why don’t u cosplay?
[1:06:12] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Oh my God someone said it's Dino-sty Warriors LUL

[1:06:31] <+Pendlez> nah dude wild magic is so fun shut up
[1:06:34] <KitsuneManami> was really hoping for Bahamut Remake
[1:06:37] <@QueequegTheater> Wait, what is the archetype
[1:06:38] <%Prowtellen> i thought invasions were just inspired by miyazaki going to detroit
[1:06:39] <+Catpurnicus> yeah theres a reason they left that shit in 2E
[1:06:45] <$Solid_Stro> sabert14Smug
[1:06:50] <@QueequegTheater> Ahh
[1:06:54] <%NBUsagi> YOOOO PALADIN SQUAD
[1:06:54] <+The_EL_Destino> BattleMage
[1:06:56] <+Catpurnicus> what if natural ones happened like 70% of the time
[1:06:56] <teflonbilly777> Atheist paladin
[1:07:01] <this_guy_115> They added STRIKERS TO ASB, LETS GO
[1:07:14] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I like druids because humans are basically druids anyway, we keep domesticating dangerous animals
[1:07:18] <%hewlettfan96> Do you enjoy mirror wind and it’s sequels they’ve aged pretty poorly but theyre still charming
[1:07:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> I only roll on the D10000 wild magic table B)
[1:07:23] <+happyfaceman> the best part of the Sony event was all the people in the chat saying L
[1:07:35] <%Maids4lyfe> @teflonbilly777 those are possible, their power comes from their faith in the law itself not god
[1:07:39] <dan_g_v> it was just the standard Sony Direct, not THAT bad
[1:07:49] <DanThePumpkinman> WAIT, ADVANCE WARS GOT DELAYED!? FUCK YOU RUSSIA
[1:07:52] <@QueequegTheater> But I wanted Akiyama
[1:08:02] <+happyfaceman> @dan_g_v their ending trailer looked like an Xbox Live Arcade game
[1:08:03] <stickandstonefruit> howdy teaBongo
[1:08:04] <%thecelticmaster> Yeah I get it. I'm just sad that everyone else is there, and then Nick.
[1:08:11] <jumpyhugs> Hoarfrost is GOATED
[1:08:18] <%Maids4lyfe> teaBongo
[1:08:19] <@QueequegTheater> Hoarfrost stomp is so overpowered
[1:08:22] <scrumbotime> its, stupid good
[1:08:26] <jumpyhugs> Crucible Knight, WRECKED
[1:08:30] <%Brassnarwhal> where is it again?
[1:08:35] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[1:08:35] <dan_g_v> @happyfaceman yeah, it was the standard Sony Direct
[1:08:39] <jumpyhugs> Crabs, WRECKED
[1:08:39] <tolloponik> you can equip stomp to other weapons?
[1:08:43] <Sunstalker> Grab a Flamberge, slap frost on it and Wild Strikes. Just windmill stuff to death
[1:08:43] <stickandstonefruit> @Maids4lyfe teaWow
[1:08:45] <+aaymon86> For a measly 8 FP!
[1:08:46] <%Mr_Pylon> it's carrying me right now
[1:08:46] <@QueequegTheater> I stuck with the Grafted Blade's +5 to all stats tbh
[1:08:48] <+Grayhammatter> ah fuck, really?
[1:08:49] <Zombrocom> Hoarfrost stomp + ice spear ashes of war makes you into a godly frost knight
[1:08:52] <domukujira> does it actually frostbite?
[1:08:57] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt If you hit someone with a torch after proccing the frostbite from Hoarfrost Stomp, it immediately cleanses Frostbite and you can reapply it instantly.
[1:09:00] <%Brassnarwhal> thanks
[1:09:04] <+aaymon86> Ice status on a weapon is broken too
[1:09:05] <+Pendlez> boooo
[1:09:07] <%Brassnarwhal> appreciate you pat
[1:09:08] <%Maids4lyfe> @stickandstonefruit teaHi fello dino
[1:09:11] <+happyfaceman> @dan_g_v I mean atleast a standard Sony Direct gets us stuff like Snoot Game
[1:09:11] <@Spydurman> booooo
[1:09:12] <%CalderGaming> @tolloponik if you get the standalone Ash of War yes
[1:09:17] <NewWillinium> I need to hunt down Ice Spear. It's needed for my Frost Mage build
[1:09:17] <ReenBenkyou> Helo, Elmo!
[1:09:25] <tanarath> elmo!
[1:09:29] <%Brassnarwhal> that's accurate that's why i never worry about my tires
[1:09:36] <%Maids4lyfe> psaPorgmo
[1:09:48] <@goose_attack_almanac> Oh the Dialogue wheel sucks fucking ass
[1:09:50] <ReenBenkyou> b
[1:09:52] <dan_g_v> aww such adorable sneeze
[1:09:53] <%NBUsagi> Wait a minute, WTF WAS THAT?
[1:09:53] <ReenBenkyou> bless you
[1:09:54] <+Pendlez> WHY DO YOU SNEEZE LIKE THAT
[1:09:55] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> WTF WAS THAT
[1:09:57] <@QueequegTheater> Yeah, like that face you made just now
[1:10:03] <%captainpodock> fake sneeze
[1:10:04] <%CalderGaming> @domukujira yup it inflicts frost buildup
[1:10:05] <%NBUsagi> Why the fuck does Pat have cute sneezes?!
[1:10:09] <%Brassnarwhal> bless you pat
[1:10:23] <%GustauveVIII> dialogue wheel is shit dont know why they think its a good idea
[1:10:23] <Ghufufin> its revolutionary, you have options that matter!
[1:10:23] <%Valdorick> Dialog Wheel was a godsend for Console RPGs... *then it bled into everything*
[1:10:25] <oda_flobunaga> Gesundheit
[1:10:31] <%CTMathiu> Cute sneeze~
[1:10:34] <Sunstalker> Yo Pat, we all missed a fkn dungeon in the center of Caelid, that has the golden scarab talisman to boost runes.
[1:10:35] <@goose_attack_almanac> Dialogue Wheel is ass since it doesn't actually tell you whats being said. Just a vague suggestion. Sometimes.
[1:10:38] <+charp35> I hate dialog wheels
[1:10:40] <BinaryShuffle> I always hated it.
[1:10:43] <%Mr_Pylon> Then the wheels started lying to you about what they would make you say.
[1:10:44] <batscientist> I just got here, what game are you talking about?
[1:10:50] <tolloponik> no I hated it from the start
[1:10:53] <%Valdorick> @Sunstalker Pat did that one off screen
[1:11:03] <%Daskolin> Dialog wheel was a mistake
[1:11:06] <jubejube56> Dialog decohedron
[1:11:10] <DoctorMulholland> Stranger of Paradise looks like my kind of stupid
[1:11:15] <dan_g_v> Pat is gonna finish it 5 other times with other classes
[1:11:16] <peachy996> FOREVER AND EVER
[1:11:26] <%Valdorick> Dialog Dice. The game picks the dialog for you.
[1:11:27] <%tetraes> @PatStaresAt  if they release DLC for Elden Ring would u stream it?
[1:11:30] <%SveriSageAdvice> confuuuusion
[1:11:30] <%GustauveVIII> confucius
[1:11:32] <MechanizedGentleman> say whatnow?
[1:11:33] <%captainpodock> captainpodock subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Happy two years; Thanks for being a distraction while I deal with a tooth infection, it sucks.
[1:11:33] <%Bluwizard21> confussy
[1:11:36] <@Ranryu692> Pat is very confussy
[1:11:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> That meme of the dude with all the question marks around his head
[1:11:41] <peachy996> That's the name of a sick techno track in Blade 1
[1:11:52] <%Brassnarwhal> sipsipSipsipblind
[1:11:55] <%topendbuzza> dialog dice is just disco
[1:12:13] <@goose_attack_almanac> @batscientist I had mentioned Dragon Age 2s dialogue options affecting the main characters Personality and line delivery overall instead of just with whatever choice you pick. However the modern Bioware dialogue wheel is garbage and doesn't tell you anything beyond a vague suggestion
[1:12:13] <+beansoup> i'm 3 achievements off 100%..... i've played way too much of this game.
[1:12:14] <%barrakuta371> Confucius
[1:12:22] <@QueequegTheater> Yeah a lot of people are having issues with Vyke's invasion
[1:12:24] <teflonbilly777> @peachy996 I always just called it the blood rave song
[1:12:39] <%Glass_Muffin> @PatStaresAt Have you seen the crazy Moghwyn boss break going arounds it is so goofy
[1:12:39] <%Daskolin> @PatStaresAt My only fear if dlc will be the size of the game. My ocd will not survive that
[1:12:41] <+SaintSalted> idk he invaded me after i beat the game
[1:12:41] <%CalderGaming> ffffff
[1:12:43] <domukujira> same thing ha
[1:12:49] <%JGardner03> or that one chest that takes you to the divine bridge in altus
[1:12:53] <+Pendlez> god I just arrived in Liurnia and these words mean NOTHING to me
[1:12:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[1:12:54] <Akett> I've been to Capital outskirts and got invaded by him.
[1:12:56] <%tetraes> but i took the lift and he still invaded me
[1:12:59] <%Bluwizard21> shit can unbreak too
[1:13:00] <%gitgouda> lol
[1:13:00] <%CalderGaming> it's just a weird bug
[1:13:03] <butthurtdave> Hey Pat, do you think holy damage is bugged in the game right now?  I was under the impression that holy infused weapons would do the permakill on skeletons
[1:13:04] <%Brassnarwhal> i got vyke to invade after i got teleported to the capital pat
[1:13:04] <teflonbilly777> I'm out, Pat is far ahead of me in this. Thanks for the stream Pat and chat
[1:13:06] <oda_flobunaga> Nobody fucking knows
[1:13:08] <DoctorMulholland> NPC quests are still as inscrutable as ever and I aint even mad
[1:13:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> that's a elden ring
[1:13:18] <HeroToxiko> he invaded me the moment i went where he is, i have the key for the lift tho
[1:13:21] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt hey pat did you hear that like 10 NPC triggers are just broken so many of the quests don't properly finish?
[1:13:25] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Oh word, Diofield Chronicles is a Platinum Joint?
[1:13:28] <+SomeFreeTime> how good is that kamehameha spell in pvp?
[1:13:29] <batscientist> @goose_attack_almanac ah yeah I feel that completely. the little tone icons feel ultimately unhelpful now
[1:13:38] <peachy996> People getting excited for what they thought was Dino Crisis 4 but getting the rug pulled out from under them is the best statement about vidya lately
[1:13:39] <tolloponik> I just wanted to make a good int build but now I know that going to the int place fucks a lot of NPC quest NotLikeThis
[1:13:54] <42nfl19> oh shit did I miss the Sony thing? was there ANYTHING to care about?
[1:13:55] <+izanagi22> Wait the strategy game was the Platinum game, not Valkryie?
[1:13:57] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I think Nepheli and Diallos are just cut content
[1:14:04] <%rDAKODAc> @patstaresat So apparently that NOT FF Tactics game is developed by Platinum
[1:14:05] <jumpyhugs> I think Irina might be bugged too
[1:14:08] <it_came_from_outer_space> margit is really excellent imo
[1:14:13] <%geekjacob> the desert zoom man
[1:14:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Scrimblo 100%
[1:14:26] <%JoshManVGH> What!?
[1:14:31] <%Brassnarwhal> @42nfl19 not dyno crisis got announced, gundam shooter looks cool, the wrong jojo fighter got announced
[1:14:33] <%NBUsagi> Radahn is a beast
[1:14:33] <%earthboy2k> Ranella looks amazing
[1:14:34] <+izanagi22> New Chaos demo, Returnal update w/ Co-op and survival mode @42nfl19
[1:14:35] <%livi242> he's not that bad just stressful
[1:14:35] <beegcombo> How was the Sony thing
[1:14:37] <+degenbtv> he was great
[1:14:38] <peachy996> You fight Paige yet?
[1:14:39] <%Mendacii> Crucible Knight tapped my taint for a solid 30 mins earlier today
[1:14:44] <@QueequegTheater> It's such a good spectacle
[1:14:44] <+tsamxxx> his horse is fucking stupid yeah I said it
[1:14:46] <%Valdorick> Astel is pretty great
[1:14:48] <+Beetlewins> Dude just loves his horse
[1:14:48] <mrcelab> Is Zengief snoring again Pat????
[1:14:51] <DoctorMulholland> People talk about Margit as this amazing early game boss but I played for 30 hours fucking around in Caelid and Siofra before I even FOUND Margit
[1:14:52] <@goose_attack_almanac> Radahn is Powerful, but you can actually chunk him easy enough
[1:14:53] <senfood> HE DID IT ALL FOR HIS TINY HORSE
[1:14:56] <Zombrocom> Radahn is pretty rad. Turns into a meteor and doesn't afraid of anything
[1:14:56] <@QueequegTheater> @tsamxxx D: His name is Leonard
[1:14:57] <%greasypete00> radahn was terrible on PC for me, his attacks caused so much lag that the game would eat my inputs and not give me an action
[1:14:57] <%quantras6> I like the gimmick of Radahn is cool, you and all the boys fighting him together.
[1:15:00] <DoctorMulholland> This game is wild
[1:15:01] <Rojahh> NGL Radahn is more fun on foot, hated fighting on Torrent
[1:15:01] <CH3F015> I love Radahn
[1:15:01] <Ravioli_Ronin> I love big man on a tiny horse
[1:15:05] <tolloponik> @rDAKODAc wow platinum is still working with square? after the Babylon's fall?!
[1:15:09] <DynzelWashington> I enjoy the Radahn fight, but the run is frustrating.
[1:15:13] <theghosttcatt> astel is space anal beads with pincers...
[1:15:16] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I don't remember subbing that?
[1:15:23] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt The Crucible Knights feel like Tanimura saw everyone skipping DS2 and took personal offense
[1:15:37] <jumpyhugs> Chat, wish me luck while I try to farm this cuckoo knight helm
[1:15:39] <@Ranryu692> psaLol
[1:15:40] <+Reaverund> The preamble to Radahn is great, I hated the fight. Almost no entry points for heavy melee builds.
[1:15:41] <%Bluwizard21> what a hack stealin my name
[1:15:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> great, now there are two
[1:15:44] <%SirGO0SE> lots of blue wizards out here
[1:15:47] <@Spydurman> LUL
[1:15:48] <%JGardner03> I'm still astonished that Ezykes decay melts bosses like crazy
[1:15:50] <@QueequegTheater> This is getting out of hand
[1:16:00] <+beansoup> Radahn is one of the coolest characters in all of souls. His boss fight was okay, but a lot of the complaints are valid.
[1:16:03] <%xcompleasedad> No, FIGHT
[1:16:05] <+Beetlewins> pfft red mages are better
[1:16:05] <jubejube56> Friggen blue mages
[1:16:05] <%abakkus> spidermen pointing at each other moments
[1:16:06] <digaogrunge> FIGHT
[1:16:07] <NitronStreams> *spiderman pointing meme*
[1:16:10] <doster504> one of the reasons people hate radahn so much I think is that you can get to him super early
[1:16:20] <%Brassnarwhal> this chat is only big enough for 1 blue wizard, you guys have to fight to the death
[1:16:25] <%coward_man> coward_man subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 30 hours into elden ring and I'm only partly into lunaria and I know I've missed stuff in limgrave, send help
[1:16:27] <Zombrocom> I hated the crucible knight in the goal when I first fought him because I was quite underleveled, now much later they are some of the most fun fights
[1:16:30] <%D00msDayDan> all of the mages
[1:16:31] <%abakkus> WIZARD BATTLE
[1:16:33] <%Buttlo> Is Radahn's hobby horse the strongest character in the Fromsoft universe?
[1:16:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> too many mages, not enough colors
[1:16:34] <%SirGO0SE> too many magic users atpCap
[1:16:35] <%BlackMage66652> Awkward
[1:16:36] <%barrakuta371> be friends. now kith
[1:16:38] <%Maids4lyfe> lmao
[1:16:38] <@QueequegTheater> FUCKING MAGE META
[1:16:39] <%Wallabri> Mage invasions
[1:16:39] <+SaintSalted> thats a nasty mix up
[1:16:41] <lyzejag> NOW FIGHT
[1:16:43] <MaritimeSpanker> it's the orb
[1:16:44] <NitronStreams> Lotta Magick Folks it the club tonight
[1:16:44] <%Brassnarwhal> WIZARD FIGHT
[1:16:45] <+Grayhammatter> WIZARD battle!
[1:16:45] <MaritimeSpanker> they ponderin'
[1:16:46] <%JoshManVGH> WIZARD
[1:16:46] <%Bluwizard21> the magicians are multipying
[1:16:49] <%epide> couse we magic
[1:16:50] <digaogrunge> WIZARDS VS MAGES
[1:16:50] <Ghufufin> there can only be one
[1:16:51] <%Fenrisulfr_V> It's okay guys, Green Mages are the best.
[1:16:51] <@Ranryu692> lotta 30 year old virgins I guess
[1:16:55] <NewWillinium> Gun Mages are rad
[1:16:55] <IvanMistwalker> WIZARD BATTLE!
[1:16:56] <%NovaKnightmare> NovaKnightmare subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months! Hey Pat  just beat Elden Ring not too long ago. Wont give spoilers like a good lad, but it is easily the hardest from soft game Ive played. Also maybe the best. Whens the book GRRM?
[1:16:56] <oda_flobunaga> Wizz harder
[1:16:59] <peachy996> I wish Lizardman was in SC6
[1:17:00] <blue8moon> so man wizards
[1:17:00] <tolloponik> where's the fucking tanks!!!
[1:17:00] <@QueequegTheater> I hate wizards.  Engage is glorious melee, you cowards >:(
[1:17:02] <+thickshield> I know right, since you hate on wizards all the time... its like they like it or something
[1:17:04] <peachy996> And Rock
[1:17:06] <$ToxInjection> lot of you motherfuckers spec'ing into magic, geez
[1:17:08] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt Pat, If You are a the Endgame boss, what Item do You spawn? Kappa
[1:17:20] <MechanizedGentleman> @QueequegTheater red mage says hi
[1:17:27] <it_came_from_outer_space> Go back to complaining about magicka wizard wars flopping you wizards
[1:17:35] <%Brassnarwhal> @queequegtheater you can fight me if you can reach me club scrub LUL
[1:17:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> the idea that you're not even in the late-game yet makes me wanna cry
[1:17:40] <jorniev> is the Sony thing over?
[1:17:45] <PersonifiedTFT> Pat the final boss keeps kicking me in the taint help
[1:17:50] <%Bluwizard21> I knew a guy with an abcessed tooth said he wanted to blow his brains out
[1:17:50] <@QueequegTheater> @Brassnarwhal xenoMad
[1:17:51] <Sporkgasm> did you see diofield is being developed by platinum
[1:18:11] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt GRRM announced he's working on more stuff that's not ASOIAF on his blog today
[1:18:18] <%JoshManVGH> @sporkgasm For real!?
[1:18:26] <+beansoup> i'm not even caught up with the vods so seeing where pat is is gonna be fun
[1:18:27] <NewWillinium> It's wild to me that Elden Ring has actual story *cutscenes*. It's so great
[1:18:37] <%Brassnarwhal> @personifiedtft when i get there my summon sign will be in front of the gate for weeks like in all of these games
[1:18:45] <%coward_man> death
[1:18:46] <tanarath> @jorniev ye, it was short, kinda cool, but kinda substanceless.
[1:18:50] <jorniev> probably the aces thing
[1:18:57] <+SomeFreeTime> what gear is pat using?
[1:19:01] <@QueequegTheater> I can't wait for Winds of Winter by Brandon Sanderson
[1:19:02] <DoctorMulholland> I choose to believe George's entire contribution to Elden Ring was the words "Dung Eater"
[1:19:02] <Sporkgasm> @JoshManVGH yeah, at least according to some promo stuff on twitter
[1:19:06] <+Catpurnicus> Does anyone remember when people had sympathy for GRRM's writers block? I can't
[1:19:06] <Zombrocom> Ah, I just finished the capital yesterday. Excited to see the boss.
[1:19:12] <+678saintglock> man the leyndell music is fantastic
[1:19:14] <%Brassnarwhal> @queequegtheater let's see you run your sword carrying ass through a hundred miles of my rot dragon breath and lightning bolts 😭
[1:19:15] <digaogrunge> The Wild Cards thing
[1:19:17] <tanarath> Dino crisis, Returnal coop stuff, FFT, New Valkeryie Profile
[1:19:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> GRRM is working on dying before he can finish ASOIAF
[1:19:21] <+beansoup> This is my favourite area in all of soulsbourne
[1:19:21] <%earthboy2k> just wait lmao
[1:19:21] <MavMedic81> LET’S GO!!!
[1:19:23] <+Catpurnicus> I think it was around 2013
[1:19:24] <Ghufufin> also brain not end of stream fried
[1:19:24] <%cade_calrayn> you say that.... but you've not seen the sewers
[1:19:36] <%Brassnarwhal> @queequegtheater it would be better than anything grrm wrote
[1:19:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> Also he's apparently working on superhero comics now.
[1:19:39] <@QueequegTheater> @Brassnarwhal badgerBadge
[1:19:40] <tanarath> Oh and good tmnt collection
[1:19:44] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Do you actually think the backstory in Elden is way better compared to the other souls game with GRRM input? Or the same WTF is going on?
[1:19:55] <%cade_calrayn> You can't reach the sewers proper without a key from the Dung Eater, FYI, Pat
[1:19:55] <MechanizedGentleman> why is your face a skull face? hide your shame
[1:19:56] <NewWillinium> The Sewers *really* aren't that big. Just oddly complex to navigate
[1:20:02] <@QueequegTheater> @42nfl19 It's definitely better
[1:20:08] <digaogrunge> Wild Cards is the default scenario for GURPS Supers, I had no idea it was a GRRM thing
[1:20:10] <%sporeian94> Pat all I'm gonna say is be careful in the sewers... Melina will not do the GF experience anymore if you fuck up
[1:20:16] <Zombrocom> Yeah I actually understand the story in ER
[1:20:17] <lyzejag> Yeah it's wayyy better
[1:20:17] <%Daskolin> @Bluwizard21 After an incedent with 380V power equipment my tooth nerves died. So i dont have any tooth pain anymore
[1:20:18] <+678saintglock> @somefreetime i believe gelmir knight set except for the head which is royal remains, gargoyles blackblade, some knight greatshield and idk what seal he’s using
[1:20:27] <@goose_attack_almanac> Its better based on people straight up just telling you shit.
[1:20:30] <%Brassnarwhal> @queequegtheater it woulda been better with Sanderson
[1:20:32] <%Felhad> Wooo, just did my first ending
[1:20:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> time is less convoluted
[1:20:36] <+holliesthalo> did pat watch the state of play?
[1:20:42] <+Grayhammatter> just found a greatshield that gives regen, yeyeye
[1:20:47] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt if you're going all the way down in the sewers stop the moment you get to the visibly evil door unless you want to be locked into an ending
[1:20:49] <some_brave_apollo> remember flame god flann???
[1:20:50] <%Brassnarwhal> @holliesthalo yes
[1:20:51] <%SirGO0SE> this is far and away the most legible story
[1:20:52] <@QueequegTheater> DS2 *kinda* had a story
[1:20:56] <%cade_calrayn> they made a fancy CGI cutscene to show that sequence of events too
[1:20:58] <+Catpurnicus> They wrote just enough to say "This is Not Berserk"
[1:21:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh
[1:21:05] <+PrinceDevian> @PatStaresAt You see Ikumi Nakamura has a studio now called Unseen
[1:21:07] <%Valdorick> This is structured but still has just enough "fuck I don't know" to give Vaati 10 years of content.
[1:21:10] <+Catpurnicus> This is "Not Berserk, 2"
[1:21:12] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt there'
[1:21:13] <%cade_calrayn> You'll now when you get there, though, it's *realllly* deep
[1:21:13] <MaritimeSpanker> @rosabellamelantha it's not a locked-in
[1:21:16] <%Saadi90> Hey Pat! Hey chat! psaDabb
[1:21:19] <%sporeian94> well technically it doesn't lock you, but to unlock it, it requires a fuckton of weird shit
[1:21:20] <@goose_attack_almanac> What weapon is Pat using?
[1:21:20] <Minorou> there's a way to back out of the ending, it's fine
[1:21:20] <MaritimeSpanker> if you get it, you can opt out of it
[1:21:23] <thehangoverpt5> It also feels like I know the big characters motivations for once
[1:21:23] <MechanizedGentleman> you mean the characters mentioned in items are actually fleshed out this time?
[1:21:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> that door better be REAL evil
[1:21:25] <42nfl19> Is this what the Finger Mace is made from? those things?
[1:21:25] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt That ending has an out button, I can DM you on Twitter for it
[1:21:25] <stickandstonefruit> i dont understand how they made this game. its the biggest, the most systems, so many builds that actually work. like the fuck
[1:21:27] <MaritimeSpanker> by using an item
[1:21:28] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt It does not lock you in.  There is a way to unlock
[1:21:35] <+SaintSalted> its a cool ending tho
[1:21:35] <domukujira> its not locked
[1:21:35] <Onionchamp> You won’t be locked into it, you just gotta work for it
[1:21:37] <Midnight188> DS2 to me alwaysfelt like it existed in some kind of dream space an thats why the world made no sense
[1:21:38] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt Did You level up or made changes behind the stream?
[1:21:40] <%itstreylar> there is a way to unlock yourself from the ending
[1:21:42] <+Reaverund> I dont think it's a hard lock, I think its an option
[1:21:43] <%Bluwizard21> Vaati has like 2 years of content off this game just in lore
[1:21:43] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Tbf its almost impossible to get that ending without doing the quest related to it or looking it up
[1:21:44] <+xerj> As long as he's not wrong about things with millions of views
[1:21:44] <Zombrocom> It's mostly locked, the out button is very hidden and hard to get
[1:21:50] <tolloponik> I hate those sausage links
[1:21:52] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt there's far more than just going through that door to being "locked into" that ending. There's a specific set of actions you need to take after going through the door before you get on that patch.
[1:21:55] <RubberFistFight> path*
[1:21:55] <%cade_calrayn> but it makes you work for that opt-out, definitely
[1:21:56] <senfood> Vaati is currently in a fetal position in the corner of his room while his next video renders.
[1:22:07] <Gelphaze> How about MURDER!
[1:22:09] <rosabellamelantha> @MaritimeSpanker Unless you do Millicent's quest then it's super locked
[1:22:17] <%Daskolin> Everyone ready for like 800 hour of lore content from  vaati(cuz ya know dlc in works)
[1:22:21] <%Maids4lyfe> elden ring is making me hate hands
[1:22:23] <MaritimeSpanker> I hope pat finds the room down here
[1:22:28] <@QueequegTheater> Unlike us
[1:22:34] <%jamsbybetty> these sewers are a fuck
[1:22:39] <42nfl19> Well now that there are PC hacks, it should make it easier for Vaati to go through everything......probably lol
[1:22:44] <%Buttlo> Is that a poo monster
[1:22:48] <@goose_attack_almanac> Oh god literal shitheads
[1:22:52] <%jamsbybetty> they're the fuckest sewers in a fromsoft game I've seen
[1:22:53] <RemedyofRevenge> cum goblins
[1:23:07] <+Reaverund> Vaati is pumped that he has a ton of new content to make. Cant say the same for those poor GoT analysis channels.
[1:23:14] <%epide> u can kill it
[1:23:15] <+Rofiarf> kill it
[1:23:15] <@goose_attack_almanac> That guys seen some shit
[1:23:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> My first playthrough was in Podcast mode where I just listened to all the sound files in sequence
[1:23:21] <Gelphaze> KILL!
[1:23:23] <%whyskeywolfe> They're from another zone in the game, which tells me Pat hasn't been there yet.
[1:23:23] <%Maids4lyfe> kill it
[1:23:27] <oda_flobunaga> this place is very DS1 Depths
[1:23:30] <42nfl19> Wait something Pat did not instantly try and kill?
[1:23:31] <mrcelab> That statue mooved
[1:23:33] <yyyyfdugyu> in his twitch channel the first thing he did with the gameplay trailer is write down every line of dialogue
[1:23:38] <%Brassnarwhal> pirate pat is here
[1:23:49] <oda_flobunaga> @whyskeywolfe he has been there
[1:24:03] <%whyskeywolfe> oh so he just forgot lol
[1:24:04] <%Brassnarwhal> this is like the guy who had the lightning book
[1:24:07] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt If you need help reaching the actual sewers let us know, also becareful if you don't want to kill dungeater, I thought he was a basic enemy and swung on him cause it was dark and killed his ass
[1:24:10] <jubejube56> Confident in your navigation Pat
[1:24:11] <Ethel9727> Pat starts the stream by saying it wont be that bad
[1:24:17] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt There's a problem, though. There's a fuckton of datamined dialogue that no one knows how to trigger.
[1:24:28] <Sunstalker> Goblin at risk
[1:24:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> you gotta find the city planning building and get all the zoning documents
[1:24:29] <%cade_calrayn> Have you gotten the key from him yet, Pat?
[1:24:31] <%Valdorick> LOATHSTOME DUNGEATER
[1:24:31] <%whyskeywolfe> Everybody should kill Dung Eater.
[1:24:32] <T_Sasquatch> Vaati may really have a half decade of lore due to how big this gamw is
[1:24:33] <MaritimeSpanker> I mean, you kinda might
[1:24:34] <SQDizzy> well he IS evil
[1:24:35] <senfood> Dung Eater is literally the worst.
[1:24:39] <%cade_calrayn> It's the only way into the actual sewers
[1:24:39] <blue8moon> he does seem pretty evil
[1:24:40] <lyzejag> Yeah i fucking killed him the second i saw him;
[1:24:41] <Zombrocom> Nah, fucking kill dung eater, he's actually the worst thing ever
[1:24:41] <NewWillinium> I did straight up murder Dung-Eater. And I don't regret it. He makes our Spirit Trainer scared
[1:24:42] <senfood> THAT DUDE EATS SHIT
[1:24:46] <%SveriSageAdvice> huh, second Erdsteel dagger to make the other one a pair
[1:24:46] <%abakkus> he is a wee bit of a twat
[1:24:47] <Ethel9727> Dung Eater literally does the insane achievement of being the biggest asshole in the Soulsborne history
[1:24:54] <%greasypete00> looooathesome
[1:24:55] <%NBUsagi> isnt the Dung Eater like an evil ass hole who eats people?
[1:24:56] <+beansoup> man has doodoo breath
[1:24:56] <peachy996> So morally greY?
[1:24:57] <Zombrocom> Like literally the most evil awful thing in this crapsack world
[1:24:58] <%Maids4lyfe> he eats dung and wants to kill babies or something
[1:24:58] <%whyskeywolfe> What Dung Eater wants to do is fucking WILD.
[1:24:59] <%Brassnarwhal> he moves into firelink JUST TO TALK SHIT
[1:24:59] <some_brave_apollo> dung eater did nothing wrong (except eating dung)
[1:25:02] <+tsamxxx> dung eater isn't even the worst thing he does
[1:25:02] <+Beetlewins> Yeah I turned on Dung Eater when he implied he wanted to kill me and rape my corpse
[1:25:05] <Sunstalker> Nephali seems the most unknown quest atm. There's like no pay off yet you gift her a legendary ash bird
[1:25:09] <MechanizedGentleman> ok thats p rad
[1:25:09] <%epide> up the wing
[1:25:10] <lyzejag> I was scared he would kill npc's, not taking ANY chances
[1:25:12] <PersonifiedTFT> I also murdered the dung eater but i'll probably be friends with him next run
[1:25:13] <%cade_calrayn> y'all ready to climb a dragon?
[1:25:15] <+678saintglock> he’s even worse than i thought
[1:25:15] <+Rofiarf> climb the wing!
[1:25:16] <%SirGO0SE> lotta of judgemental people out here, you dont see me going to your house and commenting on your dinner :(
[1:25:16] <+LandOfTheWay> @NBUsagi worse
[1:25:17] <%Brassnarwhal> @nbusagi he just defiles them
[1:25:21] <PersonifiedTFT> CLIMB THE DRAGON PAT
[1:25:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> climb dramngon
[1:25:27] <ebrion> Dragon dragon, climb the dragon
[1:25:28] <%Daskolin> @senfood not true. He also have sex with corpses
[1:25:30] <laketoyaa> been trying to find a way to get to vargram
[1:25:31] <Zourath> @NBUsagi He turns people's souls into turds, and eats those turds. Actually the worst.
[1:25:36] <Sunstalker> Yeah, the dragon is a staircase
[1:25:37] <%NBUsagi> @Brassnarwhal OH GOD that is worse 0. 0
[1:25:43] <Midnight188> Nephali is summonable for the final boss i'd wager
[1:25:48] <+Beetlewins> I bet you have to fight a dragon that big in the dlc
[1:25:54] <%Brassnarwhal> @sirgo0se the dung eating isn't the issue it's the corpse defiling
[1:25:55] <senfood> Dung Eater is somehow more awful than Selevus and that guy's terrible.
[1:25:58] <vonmaultke> Dung eater can talk?, I just killed him because he looked like an invader
[1:25:59] <RemedyofRevenge> the entry to the deep sewers is a bit easy to miss if you arent vigilant for it
[1:26:01] <tolloponik> wow you can just walk around them huh Kappa
[1:26:02] <$vehementvadr> L + ratio + eats dung + loathsome + tarnished + no maidens + touch grace
[1:26:05] <+AnthraxJohnson> What sword is that?
[1:26:12] <%Brassnarwhal> @midnight188 idtrather have alexander
[1:26:16] <@QueequegTheater> Gargoyle sword
[1:26:19] <DestroPrime83> Hey Pat, ive been playing the Elder Scrolls blades App and in Classic bethesda fashion its crashed on my 5 times already
[1:26:20] <+bravo059> which sword is that?
[1:26:21] <%Buttlo> It's pretty sick those guards don't hear that gigantic lightning glaive and turn around.
[1:26:24] <%Maids4lyfe> that was sick
[1:26:26] <PersonifiedTFT> god faith got ALL the cool shit huh
[1:26:29] <Zombrocom> Gargoyle's Blacksword
[1:26:30] <%Maids4lyfe> gargoyle sword
[1:26:31] <MechanizedGentleman> did paige make pat wear the skull face?
[1:26:43] <%Brassnarwhal> @personifiedtft there are some cool ass spells too
[1:26:51] <@Ranryu692> @MechanizedGentleman not explicitly, but he's probably been trained by this point
[1:26:55] <%xcompleasedad> @DestroPrime83 They cannot optimize to save their souls
[1:26:57] <%ScreamLord> @AnthraxJohnson Black Blade, from the Gargoyal in front of the Beastial Sanctum
[1:27:58] <DestroPrime83> I literally had to keep opening the App till the communication errors stopped
[1:28:00] <domukujira> theres so many faith weps in this i lost count
[1:28:17] <DestroPrime83> like smashing my head against a wall till the wall broke
[1:28:19] <%Kevlar_Caviar> oh my god, the ASB remaster is changing the default color schemes to match the anime
[1:28:21] <%Kevlar_Caviar> thank god
[1:28:29] <@QueequegTheater> @Kevlar_Caviar kino
[1:28:54] <NewWillinium> Oh cool. You can turn Eye Alterations to "Off" in the Cosmetics menu. Sweet
[1:29:02] <%Kevlar_Caviar> and all of the voice actors from ASB have been replaced with their anime counterparts
[1:29:16] <DestroPrime83> And now I go and play Skyrim because Elden Ring is too hard for me
[1:29:20] <%Kevlar_Caviar> so josuke doesnt have a super deep voice anymore
[1:29:37] <42nfl19> Is there still no way to turn off helmets for style?
[1:29:38] <@QueequegTheater> @Kevlar_Caviar Give us the English dub actors too
[1:29:47] <@QueequegTheater> I want my Kellen Goff Diavolo, dammit
[1:30:06] <+678saintglock> quick question for anyone how good is soul arrow in DeS?
[1:30:29] <%Kevlar_Caviar> there's no way in hell that they're gonna do an english dub of this game
[1:30:36] <%Kevlar_Caviar> although that would be awesome
[1:30:40] <@QueequegTheater> @Kevlar_Caviar But I like the dub more
[1:30:43] <@QueequegTheater> I want it
[1:30:57] <%Kevlar_Caviar> tfw no freddy fazbear diavolo
[1:31:06] <%Dakuu75> Brb again? Everything good?
[1:31:24] <$vehementvadr> ok but what if that loathsome dungeaterussy was smack tho
[1:31:26] <%Kevlar_Caviar> WAIT
[1:31:35] <%Kevlar_Caviar> THEY'RE ACTUALLY UPDATING THE GAMEPLAY TOO
[1:31:38] <@QueequegTheater> I mean, it's a good thing to have Diavolo sound like a paranoid lunatic rather than another deep-voiced imposing crime man
[1:31:46] <%Kevlar_Caviar> HIT STOPS AND JUMP DASHES???? THERE'S ACTUAL EFFORT PUT INTO THIS
[1:31:50] <@QueequegTheater> Because he's kind of a paranoid lunatic
[1:31:57] <+SaintSalted> he peed so hard he shitted me thinks
[1:32:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> @vehementvadr 😠
[1:32:09] <@QueequegTheater> Pat dead
[1:32:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> no
[1:32:15] <%Dakuu75> Been there
[1:32:16] <%whyskeywolfe> I mean, the anime dub scene has like 3 voices total, so sure, more variety please.
[1:32:41] <@QueequegTheater> Sure, if you only watch Funimation dubs
[1:32:59] <@QueequegTheater> Funi didn't dub Jojo that's why it's a good dub Kappa
[1:33:01] <%twistedj3ster> I left 20 mins ago to get food on a brb and came back to a brb, Zangief finally got the hang of that knife, huh
[1:33:50] <%whyskeywolfe> Oh don't mind me, I'm just generally wary of any industry that gave Chris Sabat a job for life.
[1:33:50] <@QueequegTheater> psaDogchamp
[1:33:56] <42nfl19> "Gief whats that in your mouth?" "A knife" "NO!"
[1:34:02] <$vehementvadr> Black Knife Zangief
[1:34:28] <%twistedj3ster> Why do Pat's kitchen knives stack bleed
[1:34:44] <@QueequegTheater> @whyskeywolfe Don't worry, I'm of the opinion we should go back to the Shakespeare era tradition of treating all actors like 2nd class citizens
[1:34:49] <jubejube56> They are coated in ketchup grease
[1:34:55] <%Bluwizard21> super poop
[1:35:26] <+turbothot666> pat fell in the toilet i think
[1:35:31] <lyzejag> Btw guys the Jojo port is coming to every platform current platform, check the official Bandai Namco trailer
[1:35:33] <%whyskeywolfe> @QueequegTheater We're close, but there's still much more work to be done.
[1:35:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> *ctors 🤢
[1:35:42] <$vehementvadr> elmo is the same color as the godskin apostles...
[1:35:45] <%Saadi90> Pat giving birth

[1:37:17] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @PatStaresAt the ASB remaster has huge changes to the gameplay: hit-stops, jump-dashes, and character switching
[1:37:19] <mike2hands> My streamer
[1:37:23] <DestroPrime83> wow 2 streams in a row streamer hard muted themselves
[1:37:24] <%Brassnarwhal> ooh cool
[1:37:24] <NewWillinium> It took me two days of looking to find the entrance to the Sewers. I felt really dumb when I found it
[1:37:30] <ebrion> Mr Hanky, NO!
[1:37:37] <%livi242> apparently DioField is being made by Platinum
[1:37:37] <+orochiblood> and new characters
[1:37:40] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt That's the way down to the real sewers
[1:37:42] <FrostedZaibatsu> Thats a go down

[1:38:09] <blue8moon> the capital is giving me some mild anxiety NotLikeThis
[1:38:11] <%Dakuu75> @newwillinium Where was it? Im gonna head there today
[1:38:13] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Leyndell is like twice as big as Stormveil
[1:38:14] <%SveriSageAdvice> there should be a grace near here? i dont know if you grabbed it though
[1:38:15] <silentblast93> pat are you at pompeii?
[1:38:16] <%Kevlar_Caviar> oh they just announced that the """story mode""" is getting a revamp
[1:38:17] <+Beetlewins> hope the dlc for this lets us explore the sky temple before it got blown up
[1:38:17] <mrcelab> Well, you wanted to go sewers
[1:38:25] <%JGardner03> I completely walked past the door to the real sewers initially
[1:38:30] <vonmaultke> Time to Power scrap
[1:38:33] <%cade_calrayn> That's accurate
[1:38:38] <+Mrbaconator> i think it's dumb you can't use your horse here
[1:38:44] <%Dakuu75> Oh well, there we go i guess
[1:39:02] <%Bluwizard21> It very much can be
[1:39:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> NotLikeThis
[1:39:11] <%SveriSageAdvice> the regular way is to come from a grace and hop down from the bridge
[1:39:13] <%cade_calrayn> You jump off the railing on the avenue above, that's how you're supposed to get here
[1:39:17] <+InhumanMilitia> hey pat how does it feel for you after a longer soak?
[1:39:24] <lyzejag> My brain is melting help
[1:39:26] <@QueequegTheater> iouno
[1:39:33] <%SveriSageAdvice> ok yeah it looks like you didnt pick up a grace
[1:39:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat the intended route to the mountain is to get eaten by a robo-virgin, nothing is off the table
[1:39:36] <%TheGuesty> I wish this place didn;t look like old country =(
[1:39:37] <XxMoliciousxX> can you fit all of boletaria in here?
[1:39:40] <eleskei> this place looks swank
[1:39:46] <ralphfromdk> chat, what sword is that? :o
[1:39:55] <FrostedZaibatsu> What sword is pat using?
[1:40:01] <@QueequegTheater> Gargoyle
[1:40:02] <+Green_0w0> wow he finally put points in vigor SeemsGood
[1:40:04] <%TheGuesty> gargoyle black sword?
[1:40:12] <$JoshManVGH> Gargoyles Black Blade
[1:40:14] <FrostedZaibatsu> thx
[1:40:16] <%Brassnarwhal> @theguesty yes
[1:40:34] <@QueequegTheater> Has he fought any bosses here yet
[1:40:41] <senfood> hhh hhh hhh
[1:40:46] <jumpyhugs> does anyone know if fast travelling undoes the effect of pickled feet?
[1:40:46] <%SveriSageAdvice> he hasnt yet
[1:40:49] <Harrysd> What sword are you using
[1:40:55] <DestroPrime83> *Anxiety Rising*
[1:41:00] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt After seeing you in action, I believe a SL1 is achieveable if people stack status effects frost poison rot bleed are nuts in combination
[1:41:02] <@QueequegTheater> Oh my god chat
[1:41:10] <DestroPrime83> MF just gave you the finger?
[1:41:10] <@QueequegTheater> He is using the Gargoyle Black Sword
[1:41:13] <%SveriSageAdvice> well if you count bosses as only ones with showable healthbars
[1:41:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> bruh
[1:41:25] <RemedyofRevenge> !weapon
[1:41:30] <%livi242> that reminds me of BoTW
[1:41:30] <Ashecroft> yeah, WR speedrun is 59 mins for now
[1:41:32] <lyzejag> WHAT ?????
[1:41:33] <+izanagi22> God I love speedruns
[1:41:34] <%cade_calrayn> @QueequegTheater he has not, no, no bosses
[1:41:34] <senfood> The new speedrun is less than an hour.
[1:41:36] <%JoshManVGH> Wrong Warps?
[1:41:37] <FrostedZaibatsu> I just heard 2 hour clears the other day
[1:41:37] <lyzejag> NO FUCKING WAY
[1:41:39] <jumpyhugs> this game has WRONG WARPS?!?!
[1:41:41] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater yeah that's great which sword tho Kappa
[1:41:44] <+izanagi22> For now is the keyword
[1:41:45] <+LandOfTheWay> that's bullshit, but i believe it
[1:41:46] <%SveriSageAdvice> hahah yeah i guess that would be the hand's middle finger
[1:41:47] <%Saadi90> Yeah the speed runs are nuts
[1:41:50] <@QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight >:(
[1:41:51] <XxMoliciousxX> how long for glitchless?
[1:42:01] <lyzejag> This game is going to end up at like 30 minutes in 2 weeks
[1:42:05] <PenguinPall> these sewers go DEEEEEEEEP
[1:42:05] <+eanscrale> any% baybeeee
[1:42:10] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt how long until backwards torrent jumps
[1:42:10] <%JoshManVGH> Ooh near
[1:42:24] <%cade_calrayn> dragon is progression, FYI, Pat
[1:42:25] <rosabellamelantha> BLJ
[1:42:32] <lyzejag> Yeah, Dark Souls 1 had one at Firelink. It teleported you at the Kiln
[1:42:46] <x2Twistedx> i accidently teleported here , i am not ready
[1:42:47] <jumpyhugs> Yoooooo we got OOT in ER?!?!
[1:42:48] <rosabellamelantha> Grace above
[1:42:48] <GunEden> or just use quickstep
[1:42:48] <+BubbaRands> Scoot through the goop.  got it
[1:42:49] <jumpyhugs> Let's go!
[1:42:53] <%Zulrez> wait, that happend to me(not on porpuse) i was going to kill the boss to the rune farm spot, took a break and when i came back it loaded me past him
[1:42:56] <@QueequegTheater> yup
[1:42:57] <Ashecroft> DS1 had one in Oolacile where it teleported you right to Gwyn
[1:43:01] <FrostedZaibatsu> I used quickstep. Loved it in DS3
[1:43:04] <lethallylactic> Grace PogChamp
[1:43:13] <+FlappySeal_> That speedrun is wild. The guy gets into the chapel in Volcano Manor where you fight the round guy, then glitches it so he just never aggros and he just wails on it until it dies
[1:43:22] <%Brassnarwhal> if you get disconnected from co-op at the right moment as the boss dies you get significantly more souls upon returning to your world,it keeps happening to me but I'm bot sure if people are dropping on purpose or if I'm lucky
[1:43:22] <%SveriSageAdvice> this is the grace i used to drop down the quickest into the sewers
[1:43:22] <zenith0111> This capitol is fucking dense
[1:43:24] <andrewoid_> the wrongwarps in this i think abuse a bugged bonfire that puts you in a sorta falling state when you rememberance of grace back to it
[1:43:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> boy I can't wait to come here in 30 hours
[1:43:37] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you came in it backwards
[1:43:38] <lethallylactic> LUL
[1:43:39] <zenith0111> YEYEYE
[1:43:43] <%twistedj3ster> breathe Pat
[1:43:44] <zenith0111> Mind Goblins goooo
[1:43:47] <$HyperionXV> LUL
[1:43:48] <Ethel9727> "This area wont be that bad."
[1:43:48] <andrewoid_> so you quit out and it tries to put you in the place you last were, but the map unloaded, so it just puts you in the default position
[1:43:49] <lethallylactic> lmao
[1:43:49] <lootagent> Pat do you have bloodhound step which is super rad
[1:43:49] <@QueequegTheater> Wait how did he get here backwards
[1:43:51] <@QueequegTheater> WTF
[1:43:53] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt easy to navigate huh?
[1:43:55] <athuramn> what quest is that red mark on pats map?
[1:43:57] <eleskei> a headless lady monstar
[1:44:03] <FrostedZaibatsu> This is the Erdtree town
[1:44:07] <%SveriSageAdvice> he went SUPER around lol @QueequegTheater
[1:44:07] <@QueequegTheater> HOW DID YOU DO THIS PAT
[1:44:12] <lethallylactic> So a threw a rock at him!
[1:44:14] <some_brave_apollo> lol what if you fought the asylum demon 50 times in one game
[1:44:15] <%whyskeywolfe> I've dipped out for a few streams, has he cleared the boss of Leyndell yet?
[1:44:20] <jumpyhugs> Oh shit, Pat got the Black Knife Ash
[1:44:25] <zenith0111> @queequegtheater Theres the front entrance and the back entrance thats accessible via side quest
[1:44:28] <+BubbaRands> ...it was a big rock
[1:44:33] <rosabellamelantha> Rock the STRONGEST SPELL
[1:44:40] <jumpyhugs> fighting black knives is STRESSFUL
[1:44:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> ultimate strategy
[1:44:46] <@QueequegTheater> @zenith0111 Which side quest
[1:44:51] <+Mrbaconator> good ol rock
[1:44:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> caveman shit
[1:44:54] <Ghufufin> till Pat finds the Paper spell
[1:44:55] <zenith0111> Hes coming from the "easier" side
[1:44:57] <athuramn> rock, surprisingly effective
[1:45:02] <%SveriSageAdvice> he defeated the rot spirit then went through the sewer behind this grace and tree spirit and looted the fat armor and the dress @QueequegTheater
[1:45:08] <%Brassnarwhal> @jumpyhugs the marionette soldier ashes make them a lot more manageable to fight
[1:45:09] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt almost every alley in this city is explorable
[1:45:10] <+Fetrigon> So that's what rock throw from fft actually looks like PogBones
[1:45:16] <@QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis
[1:45:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> you did ti
[1:45:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> it
[1:45:43] <%whyskeywolfe> Okay, so he hasn't cleared this zone yet. Cool.
[1:45:45] <Namillus> yo what chestpiece is that
[1:45:47] <zenith0111> @queequegtheater Like 3-4 or of them
[1:46:01] <+RedMaskBandit> PokBlaziken
[1:46:06] <rosabellamelantha> this is the first videogame city i've been in that FEELS like a city and not just a slightly larger town tbh @PatStaresAt
[1:46:16] <@QueequegTheater> @zenith0111 What I mean is, I'm trying to figure out if you can get into Leyndell without fighting a single boss from the start
[1:46:17] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh god no, Pat went through this zone super willy nilly because its probably the least navigatable place by far lol
[1:46:32] <jumpyhugs> @Brassnarwhal the one I fought so far was in a non-ash calling room about the size of my living room D:
[1:46:43] <%Dakuu75> Question: if i use the dragonseal catalyst, then i just need faith requirements for spells and can jack up my arcane. (That’s how that works right?)
[1:46:43] <%whyskeywolfe> @QueequegTheater No.
[1:46:44] <tolloponik> how did some one manage THAT parking job
[1:46:51] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Nah lol
[1:46:52] <@QueequegTheater> aww
[1:47:01] <+InhumanMilitia> pat whats your primary stats?
[1:47:02] <lethallylactic> This place feels like what it would have been like if we had gotten to explore Anor Londo's lower city streets and I am here for it
[1:47:05] <zenith0111> @queequegtheater The two fingers denies access unless tou got two great runes
[1:47:06] <%Brassnarwhal> @jumpyhugs I haven't found one I couldn't use ash for, was your furlcalling remedy active?
[1:47:09] <FrostedZaibatsu> I got stuck in this area for like 6 hours. Looked up a guide
[1:47:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> my bad, i mean to say you're going about through paths ultra differently compared to other people lol @PatStaresAt
[1:47:15] <@QueequegTheater> @zenith0111 boo
[1:47:15] <%TG_Cid11> I got lost here and had to look up where to go
[1:47:16] <+FlappySeal_> at the speed of sound~
[1:47:16] <%Felhad> EYYYYY, PAT'S WALKIN EEEEEEREEE
[1:47:21] <+Catpurnicus> Is this if Anor Londo was the size of Boletaria?
[1:47:23] <rosabellamelantha> you also can't get in here without accepting a maiden unfortunately
[1:47:23] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I'm pretty sure you can. @QueequegTheater Just need both Discs from the forts then run straight here
[1:47:29] <rosabellamelantha> maidenless % is not real
[1:47:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wandering aimlessly through the streets of Prague
[1:47:31] <T_Sasquatch> Whiff
[1:47:41] <+beansoup> i was strength and faith until late game. Went pure bleed in the end.
[1:47:42] <DestroPrime83> Whats your favorite boss fight been so far?
[1:47:52] <@QueequegTheater> @Fenrisulfr_V No, you have to beat Draconic Tree Sentinel to get in the front gate
[1:47:53] <zenith0111> @queequegtheater Its open world but they really want you to do the main content lol
[1:47:58] <%SveriSageAdvice> this city is actually the first time stopping point the game tells you to go back and do stuff
[1:48:01] <tolloponik> some spells really cant handle elevation
[1:48:02] <%Brassnarwhal> @fenrisulfr_v the fingers deny you entry without 2 great runes
[1:48:03] <%twistedj3ster> real fake door
[1:48:04] <+Grayhammatter> real fake door hours
[1:48:05] <T_Sasquatch> Very european
[1:48:07] <%SveriSageAdvice> the whole rest of the game is completely open
[1:48:14] <%cade_calrayn> No, that's a real door, you just can't open it
[1:48:19] <%cade_calrayn> yet
[1:48:19] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Fenrisulfr_V Really? I'm pretty sure I ran past him to get the grace behind him.
[1:48:25] <zenith0111> But the subtle geniues of elden ring is that all side quests tie into the main quest
[1:48:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> why lights?
[1:48:38] <DestroPrime83> Hey Pat, Whats been your Favorite boss fight so far?
[1:48:43] <%tetraes> there is a cool weapon if u climb the spear
[1:48:47] <%cade_calrayn> @Fenrisulfr_V no, the doorway is sealed  with yellow fog
[1:48:51] <%whyskeywolfe> Yeah Leyndell is a straight up maze.
[1:48:58] <@QueequegTheater> @Fenrisulfr_V I remember a gold mist door during the fight
[1:49:02] <Brainhook> Between this place and Anor Londo, which do you think is cooler?
[1:49:07] <RubberFistFight> @Fenrisulfr_V There's a gold fog door behind him. You have to beat him to get past.
[1:49:17] <%earthboy2k> mind goblin city
[1:49:22] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> game big
[1:49:23] <%Dakuu75> @destroprime83 He said the margit fight and the rodahn fight were his faves earlier
[1:49:26] <zenith0111> @brainhook Anor Londo is a nice painting but not much to explore
[1:49:30] <%Brassnarwhal> I'm really excited to start using the pot wight
[1:49:36] <DestroPrime83> ah
[1:49:37] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Wild, there's actually a "Sealed by the Great Lord's Power" in this game.
[1:49:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> yo can you climb that giant spear thing?
[1:49:40] <@QueequegTheater> MY MIIIIND
[1:49:41] <%Willowight> whats that huge spiral stick?
[1:49:52] <%SveriSageAdvice> did i for real miss that stonekey, fuck
[1:49:57] <zenith0111> Z ACCESS
[1:49:57] <Dopamien> @Brainhook this place, almost nothing is in human scale in anor londo
[1:50:03] <zenith0111> AXIS*
[1:50:07] <+FlappySeal_> @PatStaresAt If there was any item around here that can be permanently missed, would you like to know bout it? No spoils otherwise of course ^^
[1:50:12] <+beansoup> minerals
[1:50:12] <%Dakuu75> Has anyone been using the throwing pot items? I keep forgetting about those
[1:50:12] <Brainhook> Rock Stronk. psaBig
[1:50:19] <rosabellamelantha> MORE UNDERGROUND
[1:50:23] <DestroPrime83> fucking christ magic in Elden Ring is fucking nuts
[1:50:23] <%Jerp> that spell rocks
[1:50:26] <zenith0111> Time for deeper?
[1:50:31] <%SveriSageAdvice> i fully expect Pat to find some armor set or some shit that i passed by 6,000 times in here that i want ultra badly
[1:50:33] <%Brassnarwhal> that's a niiice boulda'
[1:50:34] <nesbitt22> Rock on Pat Rock on
[1:50:43] <+Fetrigon> go through it pat.
[1:50:45] <MuFuzzy649> is that a great sword or an ultra great sword?
[1:51:08] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt going up is story progress. Just so you know
[1:51:16] <Brainhook> KITTY!
[1:51:29] <%Dakuu75> @sverisageadvice I know right. I keep watching other streams of places i been all ready… and seeing shit i missed
[1:51:41] <DestroPrime83> Agh! i gave myself an arm cramp itching my Spiiiiine!
[1:51:44] <%SveriSageAdvice> Kiosks are usually an informational buildings for like maps and points of interest
[1:52:01] <lethallylactic> Perfumer buffs
[1:52:01] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt I actually highly reccomend getting to the boss of this zone above ground before you do the underground for some extra dialogue
[1:52:02] <%Willowight> perfumer shenanigans
[1:52:05] <CatsHoldingMeHostageHelp> Is this a new playthtough?
[1:52:06] <%JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt what shield is that?
[1:52:20] <%SveriSageAdvice> @Dakuu75 i've already had to go back multiple times and find weapons or armor i now have for my current build
[1:52:32] <@QueequegTheater> gotdam perfumers
[1:52:43] <Dopamien> try jumping
[1:52:51] <%SveriSageAdvice> i still havent figured out how to get to that other side safely
[1:52:53] <Dopamien> Jebaited
[1:52:54] <it_came_from_outer_space> try courage
[1:52:58] <rosabellamelantha> try finger butt hole
[1:52:59] <rReizs> the perfumer shield costing player arteria leaves is dumb when they spam that shit as enemies
[1:53:07] <%earthboy2k> 9999 appraisals
[1:53:15] <$vehementvadr> try tonge but hole??!?
[1:53:17] <%cade_calrayn> but... Pat.... try jumping
[1:53:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> try skill Kappa
[1:53:18] <zenith0111> Im trying out perfume bottle crafting items and theyre kinda op
[1:53:18] <EvelinaLoveaux> this area feels so much like yharnam in its level design
[1:53:21] <%Jerp> just need the torrent pegasus wings ability, with built in cup holder
[1:53:22] <CatsHoldingMeHostageHelp> AH SPOILERS fk bak to youtube for me
[1:53:36] <zenith0111> Perfume bottle attack boost is the highest attack buff in the game
[1:53:59] <%twistedj3ster> Lock-On does not handle 3+ enemies well
[1:54:01] <jumpyhugs> I love how I was about to check online to see if a helm was farmable, then someone's ghost just walked up wearing it
[1:54:03] <%livi242> there's something cool on the spear
[1:54:05] <%Jerp> yeah dude I'm really wanting to watch but also worried about spoilers.  so far so good at least
[1:54:14] <+FlappySeal_> why are so many doors just sealed with toffee or something
[1:54:22] <+beansoup> oh man i can't wait for woolie to explore this. He'll melt in confusion
[1:54:23] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt this area feels like if you could explore the entirety of yharnam from the moment you started the game including the blocked off regions
[1:54:33] <%Dakuu75> @zenith0111 Ooh, ill have to remember that. I been using the “flame” buff spell
[1:54:35] <%Jerp> also secretly itching to see that upcoming int build jerpMagic
[1:54:40] <@QueequegTheater> @beansoup Leyndell Capital [Part 36]
[1:54:45] <%sporeian94> Did you know Fia has a fully modeled thong under her dress in this game. Someone hacked the camera
[1:54:46] <jumpyhugs> @beansoup this used to be woolies job tho
[1:54:58] <%earthboy2k> night day cycle really messes with my memory when exploring
[1:55:05] <zenith0111> @dakuu75 Thats still one of the best buffs if youre running a fire weapon
[1:55:14] <%Jerp> sporeian someone modded the dress off as well
[1:55:17] <%twistedj3ster> it do go down
[1:55:20] <kingmemelord97> @sporeian94 interesting
[1:55:20] <%Daskolin> mmm toasty
[1:55:28] <FrostedZaibatsu> Only 2 hours into stream
[1:55:30] <tanarath> Pat have do have been
[1:55:30] <Dopamien> do have been down there good NODDERS
[1:55:31] <cs0402196> is it possible to use perfumer's attacks?
[1:55:36] <%tetraes> did Pat get all the rooftop items?
[1:55:42] <@QueequegTheater> @sporeian94 God bless the devs
[1:55:52] <NewWillinium> So I'm at the very end of the game, I apparently have two bosses left, and I have a sincere question that I think I somehow missed.  *WHAT* is the ErdTree and what does it have to do with the Elden Ring?
[1:55:53] <zenith0111> @dakuu75 The perfune bottle gives a unique "extra damage" debuff thats a skull icon
[1:55:54] <@QueequegTheater> but were you up then
[1:56:11] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Don't forget to climb the giant golden spear.
[1:56:14] <kingmemelord97> @NewWillinium yes
[1:56:16] <Ethel9727> What is "Up Dragon" :P
[1:56:16] <%Valdorick> Up dog
[1:56:18] <zenith0111> @dakuu75 But combo it with the physicks flask and its strong
[1:56:19] <tanarath> @tetraes I think he missed one item on one of the western rich district buildings
[1:56:21] <DestroPrime83> Whats Up Dragon?
[1:56:24] <%Jerp> zenith does the perfume buff all AR?  like spells too? I'm running a different aromatic ATM but running out of materials to craft em
[1:56:28] <%Brassnarwhal> has anyone found any fist weapon specific ashes of war yet?
[1:56:47] <zenith0111> @jerp Gotta test that
[1:56:52] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Brassnarwhal I found Lifesteal Fist somewhere.
[1:56:55] <T_Sasquatch> @patstaresat did you find the dragoneez weapon ?
[1:57:02] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater I had to go check if that was legit. It's SUPER legit.
[1:57:04] <%Brassnarwhal> @patstaresat remember that room in anor londo with the 3 black knights by seigmeyer?
[1:57:06] <%Valdorick> You still can, the wings are folded enough that they shielf you
[1:57:14] <JonnyBoi1992> Pat did you ever beat Satan?
[1:57:17] <%Dakuu75> @zenith0111 Ah cool. I kinda hate using the spell because it doesn’t last too long. Wish i had a talisman that increses durations
[1:57:18] <T_Sasquatch> Im not :)
[1:57:19] <oda_flobunaga> There is also lifesteal repeated thrust
[1:57:21] <%Brassnarwhal> @fenrisulfr_v that's cool, is it the dark hand grab?
[1:57:23] <@QueequegTheater> @JonnyBoi1992 Which one
[1:57:31] <+Grayhammatter> das a big dragon
[1:57:32] <lyzejag> lmao
[1:57:34] <rReizs> lifesteal fist is for fists and claws
[1:57:35] <%SveriSageAdvice> they figured they got you easily the last two times, so they were hoping for a triple
[1:57:40] <bamberfool> shoulda called it Dragonese
[1:57:42] <DestroPrime83> Deez Nutz game is lackin'
[1:57:44] <%Jerp> guess I'll test next time I play.  I know there's a holy ash of war that buffs damage/defense and that works on spells,. but it's maybe 10-15%
[1:57:44] <%Valdorick> Spear is other side, yeah
[1:57:52] <%jamsbybetty> you wanna go up the spear
[1:57:55] <FrostedZaibatsu> Took me 6 hours to find out you could climb the dragon because of the shitty bow enemy
[1:57:58] <%jamsbybetty> it's a got a Cool Thing
[1:58:02] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Brassnarwhal It's what's on Ensha's weapon. Never used it, personally.
[1:58:05] <$vehementvadr> yeah there's no way pat is high enough level to beat sukaan, no way
[1:58:09] <$Jaxnos> it drives me insane to think the critical path of the game is Limgrave, Liurnia, and then head to the capital.
[1:58:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> man crashed
[1:58:15] <tanarath> big dargun
[1:58:15] <%Valdorick> Humping the Duplex
[1:58:17] <%Jerp> ancient dragon scales make for great concrete
[1:58:20] <+Beetlewins> dude full on crashed
[1:58:29] <+5Two> This thing is coming alive, isnt it?
[1:58:37] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you can probably blame your witch wife for this because apparently Godwyn was cool with the dragons and his death seems to have not gone over well
[1:58:38] <%Brassnarwhal> @fenrisulfr_v I'm not familliar with ensha or i didnt see the attack i guess
[1:58:40] <%tetraes> @Jaxnos  actually its any 2 runes
[1:58:45] <%Willowight> didnt it say they turn into stone to protect stuff
[1:58:47] <%Jerp> if it woke up I wouldn't be surprised
[1:59:00] <%Dakuu75> This is someone’s fetish right here. Climbing all over s dragon like that
[1:59:00] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Brassnarwhal It's the skeleton assassin that invades you in the Roundtable.
[1:59:01] <%Valdorick> From the other building, yeah
[1:59:04] <%Nekros4442> @jaxnos caelid may be faster than liunia though?
[1:59:06] <42nfl19> wait wtf is that a leg
[1:59:13] <%Jerp> oh shit does the partizan have it's old moveset?  poke and sweep?
[1:59:22] <SinisterBroccoli> what chest armor is that?
[1:59:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> is this dragon bigger than the other big dragon?
[1:59:24] <devanmuse> @rosabellamelantha Witch? i know Paige is a little strange, but that's just hurtful
[1:59:33] <%Brassnarwhal> @fenrisulfr_v oh yeah that was the dark hand grab for sure
[1:59:36] <rosabellamelantha> @devanmuse lmao
[1:59:47] <42nfl19> that gnarled rock thing is not a giant tree root but a dragon? god damn
[1:59:49] <+OneGorillionDollars> that stupid soldier waited his whole life to do like 5 damage to you
[1:59:50] <Sunstalker> If you want to climb the spear structure, that'll require a drop down
[1:59:53] <+beansoup> @SinisterBroccoli it looks like gelmir
[1:59:55] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt if you fall off the side at the right here you can open the gate
[2:00:01] <$Jaxnos> @tetraes Yeah, I just was going with the ones I assume people would more likely gravitate to since Stormveil dumps you out in Liurnia
[2:00:12] <eleskei> this place is pretty
[2:00:27] <%twistedj3ster> YO?
[2:00:29] <%Jerp> Pat if you've got a moment could you check the partizan moveset?  np if you can't
[2:00:30] <Sunstalker> lever is directly above the gate
[2:00:31] <%SveriSageAdvice> unfortunately its not the bloodborne sword...
[2:00:31] <$vehementvadr> nyanners is cooming rn
[2:00:40] <@QueequegTheater> LUL
[2:00:42] <%twistedj3ster> aw...
[2:00:44] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt There's something critically important for your build inside that area. You have to jump across the roofs on the stables in there.
[2:00:48] <%Dakuu75> I’m gonna need so many color stones for this place…
[2:00:53] <eleskei> snowmans
[2:00:54] <senfood> Mozzarella Boys
[2:00:58] <rosabellamelantha> the gate
[2:00:59] <%jamsbybetty> TOOT
[2:00:59] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater so I looked into that Fia panties thing. Go check the hall in my discord.
[2:01:00] <%SveriSageAdvice> the gate below you
[2:01:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> Apparently that trumpet is a great PvP weapon
[2:01:02] <%earthboy2k> the door you thought wasnt a door
[2:01:03] <%cade_calrayn> The giant door below you, Pat
[2:01:05] <%whyskeywolfe> The door of the keep
[2:01:09] <FrostedZaibatsu> That door with the message with the emote
[2:01:14] <+FlappySeal_> door below you probably?
[2:01:21] <@QueequegTheater> Oh I saw it Kappa
[2:01:24] <%Jerp> trumpet bubble apparently has absurdly good tracking
[2:01:34] <%Valdorick> Eh, its... okay
[2:01:38] <%SveriSageAdvice> critically important huh
[2:01:48] <FrostedZaibatsu> Too much game
[2:01:58] <%Brassnarwhal> we'll see about that
[2:01:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> deciding what book to read
[2:02:01] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater ever notice how the camera's locked when Melina's around? Consensus is she's going commando.
[2:02:04] <%cade_calrayn> Look outside from that ledge, that wasn't the stables
[2:02:04] <%Fenrisulfr_V> No, it's a stable roof that leads into a side door of that manor. @PatStaresAt
[2:02:06] <zenith0111> Whats your int level btw?
[2:02:06] <yyyyfdugyu> :tf:
[2:02:15] <+beansoup> LUL
[2:02:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> sick
[2:02:20] <FrostedZaibatsu> haha KEKW
[2:02:21] <+Jeshk0> LUL what a whiff
[2:02:22] <%Valdorick> WIIF
[2:02:29] <@QueequegTheater> LUL
[2:02:29] <%twistedj3ster> we've all done it
[2:02:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> the hitboxes are too good
[2:02:48] <%Valdorick> Robbed
[2:02:54] <+Beetlewins> so these things are just regular enemies now
[2:02:57] <eleskei> was he getting ready to barf
[2:02:58] <%Jerp> I was bracing for impact with the state of play hoping they didn't announce some small upcoming dlc for ER to ride the hype cause I'm already overwhelmed with the existing content
[2:02:59] <jumpyhugs> talk about... Geometry wars Kappa
[2:03:00] <Saturation_Lizard> he does
[2:03:01] <%SveriSageAdvice> he super stays dead
[2:03:11] <andrewoid_> these fuckin gargoyles LOVE going ripostable in places you cant hit them
[2:03:15] <%TheAdMerlin> His second sword just shrunk and vanished in his hand, that looked silly
[2:03:18] <%Brassnarwhal> sick
[2:03:18] <@QueequegTheater> @Jerp Fromsoft doesn't DO small DLC my guy
[2:03:19] <RubberFistFight> "He got two!! HE GOT TWO!!! GET HEEEEMMMM!!!"
[2:03:20] <%Valdorick> That... looked like a bug...
[2:03:25] <%JustToWatch> what shield is that
[2:03:34] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you will want to go into that big building through the window on the left of it since parts of it are cut off if you go through the front door
[2:03:47] <42nfl19> what about the other weapon @PatStaresAt ?
[2:03:47] <%Dakuu75> That’s always the video game trope: a boss “now” is just a regular enemy later lol
[2:03:49] <ergulor> and the axe?
[2:03:52] <Sunstalker> I really wish there was a Black version of all the gargoyle weapons. And that the Black Halberd had a cool weapon art at least like the sword
[2:03:55] <eleskei> aww snowmens
[2:03:55] <%Brassnarwhal> dualbweirlding those would look SICK pat
[2:04:01] <%cade_calrayn> The building to the right of you
[2:04:05] <RemedyofRevenge> has Pat been to the proper sewers yet?
[2:04:05] <%Daskolin> @PatStaresAt  People already got Fia underwear item(Cheat Engine) and its called "Deathbed Smalls" LUL
[2:04:06] <@QueequegTheater> On 5th street
[2:04:07] <%cade_calrayn> Down off the ramparts
[2:04:08] <%Brassnarwhal> Dual Weilding*
[2:04:08] <%Dakuu75> CORPSE wax…
[2:04:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> i think she's mentioned the building next to you down the drop
[2:04:11] <+Panic_at_the_Discord> go to it on the left of the thing
[2:04:14] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt the building inside the ramparts
[2:04:14] <%SveriSageAdvice> mentioning*
[2:04:15] <crifff> The big building at the spot near the thing Kappa
[2:04:16] <+beansoup> If you want the thing you gotta do the thing at the thing it's simple
[2:04:16] <Alrom> the building to the west I assume
[2:04:17] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt sorry I mean the big building below you next to the tree
[2:04:17] <Angry_Ev1L> just go to a place pat LUL
[2:04:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> you know, that building
[2:04:21] <@QueequegTheater> right next to the scrimblo
[2:04:22] <oda_flobunaga> the big one
[2:04:24] <+FlappySeal_> in the lower area
[2:04:30] <+Redeyes_NI> Go to the place with the thing, inside there will be the item of things that point to the places of somewhere
[2:04:30] <%cade_calrayn> Climbing the branches is progression
[2:04:31] <SinisterBroccoli> did the twitch app get worse?
[2:04:33] <b_ikki> im pointing at the building how cant you tell
[2:04:37] <%whyskeywolfe> Turn the left side topwise - TOPWISE.
[2:04:42] <SinisterBroccoli> seems all fucky
[2:04:46] <%SirGO0SE> across the street from Big Bobby's Burritos
[2:04:48] <+Grayhammatter> right next to the scrimblo blimblo
[2:04:50] <%Valdorick> The important thing here is - Progress is through the branches. If you're climbing A LOT of branches, you're progressing... so don't do that.
[2:04:51] <%Brassnarwhal> @sinisterbroccoli always has been psaMenace
[2:04:54] <+Beetlewins> use your main finger
[2:05:00] <%Jerp> @patstaresat could get yourself a toggleable obs overlay to put on the map and ask people to play battleship with suggestions.  story critical item in C6, you sunk my battleship
[2:05:09] <jumpyhugs> @whyskeywolfe LUL i forget what that's from but I love it
[2:05:10] <+Fetrigon> creepy49Bonk those were clear instructions pat. don't be a fucking dick creepy49Bonk
[2:05:11] <Brainhook> So have peeps figured out what these colosseums are for?
[2:05:16] <+Fetrigon> creepy49Bonk creepy49Bonk creepy49Bonk creepy49Bonk creepy49Bonk creepy49Bonk creepy49Bonk creepy49Bonk
[2:05:21] <%Dakuu75> Lol chat, just bring it up if he gets NEAR the thing
[2:05:23] <Brainhook> Related to future DLCs, maybe?
[2:05:25] <@QueequegTheater> Of course you can Kappa
[2:05:28] <+abrupt_abe> I'd say it's important to put your right foot in, take your right foot out, and then shake it all about
[2:05:31] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt not necessarily, there are lockout points in the mainline
[2:05:31] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I think you are near the boss that drops the last pouch
[2:05:35] <DestroPrime83> Imagine a Burrito vendor in the middle of this shithole castle
[2:05:40] <%ElkRiverDog> These directions are starting to sound like raid callouts to me
[2:05:41] <42nfl19> hey that was the mobile key
[2:05:41] <+Beetlewins> wait the colosseums aren't just pvp things?
[2:05:42] <@QueequegTheater> @whyskeywolfe Family Guy star wars I think
[2:05:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> this man's got AxeNuts
[2:05:42] <eleskei> that axe is cool
[2:05:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> yee haw KKona
[2:05:50] <+678saintglock> right, you can always go back LUL
[2:05:54] <%Valdorick> That was RAD
[2:05:56] <%twistedj3ster> OOO
[2:05:59] <Saturation_Lizard> THAT CLOAK IS SO GOOD
[2:06:03] <%Brassnarwhal> that was awesome pat
[2:06:05] <+beansoup> LMAO
[2:06:08] <SinisterBroccoli> lmao
[2:06:09] <@QueequegTheater> WHAT
[2:06:10] <DestroPrime83> god Gladiator helms like that are so fucking cool
[2:06:13] <+trashmanasam> it rules you suck
[2:06:14] <+beansoup> looks like a halloween dracula costume
[2:06:15] <@QueequegTheater> I DIDN'T GET THAT, NOT FAIR
[2:06:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> BELLY OUT
[2:06:19] <+Fetrigon> god I love these emotes creepy49Bonk creepy49Porporu creepy49Porpkek creepy49Hmm creepy49Bonk creepy49Porpkek creepy49Hmm
[2:06:20] <senfood> CAN YOU ALTER IT
[2:06:21] <%tetraes> is pat using the enhanced guard counter talisman?
[2:06:27] <%Saadi90> Show psaOrb
[2:06:29] <+MarkoTolstov> im using that but altered LUL
[2:06:30] <+FlappySeal_> I wonder what that would look like on a female character lmao
[2:06:33] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Hot tho
[2:06:34] <+678saintglock> yes you can alter it
[2:06:35] <+LandOfTheWay> OOH, i can use that cloak for a cosplay build!
[2:06:46] <+zaddyforever> a titties out kinda look
[2:06:47] <%Valdorick> That motherfucker has TWO hammers!
[2:06:48] <42nfl19> you dont guard a door by staring at it lol
[2:06:58] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> hey pat last stream I caught you were doing volcano manor stuff. did you finish that yet?
[2:07:00] <%Dakuu75> I need more power!
[2:07:11] <%Brassnarwhal> @valdorick he showed up as a very early boss with the 2 hammers, he's cool
[2:07:13] <%SirGO0SE> therefor, you don't have the right!
[2:07:20] <Brainhook> Yup.
[2:07:21] <Alrom> It raises defense by A LOT. really good at preventing one shots
[2:07:21] <SinisterBroccoli> what shield is that? I don't recognize it
[2:07:22] <+twdlrr> yup
[2:07:23] <Ashecroft> They're for ranked PvP afaik
[2:07:23] <42nfl19> hey look.. THE PVP ZONE
[2:07:25] <%twistedj3ster> yeah, like the Nier ones
[2:07:25] <%Valdorick> Hey look, its the building that for sure isn't going to be a DLC portal at all!
[2:07:26] <it_came_from_outer_space> Becausse they probably are something like that
[2:07:28] <+ComradeHuskyGaming> 1000%
[2:07:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> There's 3 of them
[2:07:29] <lyzejag> THEY ARE
[2:07:30] <Namillus> Yeah they are extremely suspicious buildings
[2:07:34] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I think they were supposed to be PVP arenas
[2:07:37] <FrostedZaibatsu> There is DLC already in the game
[2:07:38] <%Kevlar_Caviar> no LUL
[2:07:39] <lyzejag> LANCEMCDONALD DATAMINED THE GAME
[2:07:40] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt maybe we just don't know how they work yet
[2:07:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> that'll make sense in NG+12 once you unlock the time machine
[2:07:42] <%twistedj3ster> I hope it's a boss rush thing
[2:07:42] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt They're where the modders will put DS1 2 and 3
[2:07:42] <%SirGO0SE> my favorite "you dont have the right" msg was "you dont have the right, therefor, try left"
[2:07:43] <%Brassnarwhal> they might be dlc teleporters that's a good guess
[2:07:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> no
[2:07:44] <%Felhad> ONE GUY
[2:07:48] <Scorilla> took me a while to figure out what the big jar guy in front of the one in caelid does
[2:07:53] <%Jerp> I'm expecting those colosseums to be opened whenever they officially add arena duels
[2:07:54] <%Brassnarwhal> @queequegtheater true
[2:07:56] <IminyourBase> yeah i thought you fought scripted invasions outside of them. at least the first one you did
[2:07:58] <+beansoup> It's the boy
[2:08:01] <%NovaKnightmare> what lvl is Pat?
[2:08:03] <%SveriSageAdvice> you're not able to enter them yet but they datamined some stuff about the game that seems to suggest they're mainly DLC oriented
[2:08:07] <@QueequegTheater> @NovaKnightmare 150s
[2:08:11] <thehangoverpt5> There’s even a spirit next to one bummed he can’t get in

[2:09:22] <Ravioli_Ronin> Lmao “THE CHAD NOBLE GOLDMASK vs THE VIRGIN LOATHSOME DUNG EATER”
[2:09:22] <bluefootedtpeack> *spoiler
[2:09:23] <+Kavtech> @Rofiarf Doesn't matter, you only need 11 with boosters.
[2:09:25] <it_came_from_outer_space> Aye aye
[2:09:38] <NewWillinium> So do Summoning Signs even *exist* in Elden Ring? I don't think I've seen a single other player's Summon sign int he entire game
[2:09:41] <+Rofiarf> oh kk
[2:09:42] <+RedMaskBandit> he already got spoiled by some dipshit about this
[2:09:43] <oda_flobunaga> HE ALREADY GO SPOILED ON IT
[2:09:55] <@QueequegTheater> @NewWillinium You have to use the opt-in item
[2:09:59] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> damn already
[2:10:01] <%crimsonharvest> fuck every time i click this stream its on brb
[2:10:05] <bluefootedtpeack> that sucks,
[2:10:08] <+RedMaskBandit> @newwillinium u need to use a consumable to view them bud
[2:10:12] <@QueequegTheater> @crimsonharvest This IS the stream
[2:10:17] <%crimsonharvest> i have the worst timing
[2:10:21] <$Artoo__The_Me> Why can’t people just keep it in their pants
[2:10:22] <%Brassnarwhal> @newwillinium you gotta use a furlcalling remedy to see them there are tons
[2:10:35] <it_came_from_outer_space> brb is the part where you reflect on the revelations of the stream
[2:10:43] <%Brassnarwhal> @artoo__the_me cocks out is the way to be
[2:10:48] <it_came_from_outer_space> Equally if not more important than the other parts
[2:10:51] <ebrion> Better BRB than an Ad
[2:10:52] <tolloponik> @NewWillinium there are but its very few areas the map has a button you can press that shows were summons and invasions are common and I've been using that to get summoned
[2:11:12] <%whyskeywolfe> Hard to believe Radogan is actually a Radoban from Monster Hunter World
[2:11:13] <NewWillinium> I've used the item in a couple of places, but I never seem to see anything when used in front of boss doors.
[2:11:16] <$Artoo__The_Me> Spoiler cocks
[2:11:25] <NewWillinium> The Furlcalling something or other right?
[2:11:35] <%Brassnarwhal> @whyskeywolfe ssshhh don't spoil it
[2:11:37] <%Gloom_Tangerine> Did I miss Pat fight the boss at volcano manor/mt gelmir?
[2:11:44] <@QueequegTheater> @NewWillinium Furlcalling Finger Remedy
[2:11:52] <ebrion> bock bock bock, cosmic horror, bock, bock
[2:11:58] <NewWillinium> That's the one
[2:12:08] <+SaintSalted> spoiler:cocks
[2:12:08] <%Brassnarwhal> @gloom_tangerine i think he's holding off on the final boss there for later but i could have misunderstood
[2:12:15] <@QueequegTheater> @NewWillinium They're also easily craftable
[2:12:18] <NewWillinium> Mayhaps it's because I'm playing on the PS4 as well?
[2:12:34] <bluefootedtpeack> yeah beating that boss cuts off the questline, so better to do that first.
[2:12:37] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @brassnarwhal ok cool, thanks!
[2:12:49] <%cade_calrayn> he's saving Rykard until he can finish the Volcano Manor quests, which requires access to the Mountaintop beyond the Capital
[2:12:50] <%Brassnarwhal> psaDabb
[2:13:14] <jumpyhugs> anyone know if you can drop armor/weapons for other players during coop?
[2:13:21] <@QueequegTheater> @jumpyhugs yes
[2:13:22] <%SirGO0SE> ah, it seems artists are hard to work on Ranni fan art, love to see it debugYes
[2:13:30] <jumpyhugs> nice
[2:13:33] <bluefootedtpeack> has he been spoiled on the main building to his side yet or will that be a reveal?
[2:13:38] <%Brassnarwhal> @jumpyhugs i saw someone drop an item but I didn't trust it and didnt take it
[2:13:44] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @cade_calrayn gotcha thank you! Just didn’t want to miss that fight!
[2:13:49] <jumpyhugs> LUL smart
[2:14:01] <NewWillinium> Speaking of Volcano Manor, I was doing their quests when all of a sudden a NPC I had COMPLETELY forgotten about from the beginning of the game appeared there. I feel like I skipped their NPC quest to the very end of it entirely by accident.
[2:14:12] <%Brassnarwhal> @jumpyhugs he was probably cool but you never know
[2:14:31] <jumpyhugs> were you on PC?
[2:14:41] <%Brassnarwhal> @jumpyhugs yes
[2:14:45] <reasonance> just beat those capital sewers, can't wait to see pats mind melt, fuck that place
[2:14:56] <jumpyhugs> yeaaaaah I wouldn't take it either
[2:15:08] <@QueequegTheater> @NewWillinium That questline feels extremely like cut content
[2:15:13] <oda_flobunaga> The Sewers, all the way to the bottom?
[2:15:26] <%Brassnarwhal> it isn't worth losing my 60 hour save
[2:15:56] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @NewWillinium Speaking of cut content, do you know if anyone's figured out Kenneth/Nepheli's deal yet?
[2:15:57] <%Kevlar_Caviar> two characters just got confirmed for the asb remaster: trish and prosciutto
[2:15:59] <rReizs> the sewers that made me question my sanity for a few minutes
[2:15:59] <NewWillinium> @NewWillinium Oh cool so not just me then.
[2:16:06] <reasonance> @oda_flobunaga haven't gone ALL the way, but I got to that one big elevator which I... assume is the end? sure hope so
[2:16:22] <@QueequegTheater> @NewWillinium Kenneth and Nepheli almost definitely had their content cut
[2:16:25] <NewWillinium> @NewWillinium I found something further, I was able to give her some Ashes from the area where you start the game, but otherwise nothing
[2:16:35] <RubberFistFight> @NewWillinium end of Rya's questline has a DLC hook
[2:16:40] <RubberFistFight> well, seems to be one anyway
[2:16:44] <$Artoo__The_Me> I’m still annoyed my grape quest is bugged and hope FS patches soon
[2:16:45] <@QueequegTheater> NOBODY has been able to progress Kenneth. If it was a bug, it wouldn't be this consistent
[2:16:48] <oda_flobunaga> @reasonance I have news for you.... You are not going to like it.....
[2:16:57] <NewWillinium> @NewWillinium Oooh does it really? I never managed to find her after giving her the you know what.
[2:17:02] <RubberFistFight> @NewWillinium You can kill kenneth for a golden seed. You SHOULD kill Kenneth because he's a lying cunt.
[2:17:12] <Namillus> Anyone know what Pat's chestpiece is?
[2:17:13] <reasonance> @oda_flobunaga LUL of course
[2:17:17] <%greasypete00> psaDabb
[2:17:22] <+Jeshk0> good job gief!
[2:17:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> he was full
[2:17:29] <Ner234> HUGE dumps
[2:17:32] <$vehementvadr> Mr poopy butthole
[2:17:32] <NewWillinium> @Namillus That is the Grimnir Knight I believe
[2:17:34] <bluefootedtpeack> i don't think anyone has finished alexanders yet, they're still datamining what to do with one of the items.
[2:17:36] <AdmiralButtloaf> Apparently theres a hidden area off the cliff of the Beast Sanctum
[2:17:37] <%whyskeywolfe> Now kiss the thing that made the gross shit
[2:17:39] <ebrion> Had to squeeze him a bunch then?
[2:17:39] <%TheAdMerlin> So when are we editing the gold mask onto the Pat Dab image?
[2:17:41] <%Maids4lyfe> Gief feels 20 pounds lighter
[2:17:55] <%Maids4lyfe> psaDab
[2:18:09] <%RealThiele> dabbing lord
[2:18:12] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you REALLY want to do the next part of this one

[2:18:32] <eleskei> hes doing yoga
[2:18:32] <%cade_calrayn> Pat's been spoiled on this twist sadly

[2:19:08] <kazadaz> Hey that's the bloodborne gesture
[2:19:09] <FrostedZaibatsu> Im not spoiled yet
[2:19:14] <zenith0111> You need like 46 Int to prog it anyways...
[2:19:14] <@QueequegTheater> It's somewhere in Leyndell
[2:19:15] <lyzejag> A DUMB BITCH SPOILDER IT ON TWITTER
[2:19:16] <42nfl19> well everyone SHUTUP still in case people in chat dont know
[2:19:20] <RemedyofRevenge> no spoilers still please
[2:19:20] <%Valdorick> Oh... yeah wow, that's a FUCKING SPOILER
[2:19:21] <NewWillinium> I *just* found the book with the thing you need for the Statue waaaaaaaaaaay past the point where I can do anything with it.
[2:19:22] <%Fenrisulfr_V> The one big thing you could've gotten spoiled on, and it happened to be this.
[2:19:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> btw Scrimblo is ur dad
[2:19:24] <%cade_calrayn> ^
[2:19:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat u need a spell with high INT to complete the riddle
[2:19:27] <morkelebmink> people just can't shut up
[2:19:28] <SarahPainAndToil> the world's greatest criminal rat.
[2:19:30] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Sorry Pat.
[2:19:33] <%Bluwizard21> Can someone spoil it for me in a PM I missed it and would like to know rather than chase it for 100 hours.
[2:19:37] <kazadaz> phucken huge doofus
[2:19:37] <+beansoup> i spoiled myself as i was curious how far left i had in the game.
[2:19:40] <HeroToxiko> academics are fucking weirdly stupid about media
[2:19:40] <lyzejag> CAN'T WAIT UNTIL [REDACTED]
[2:19:43] <RubberFistFight> You gotta go to wizard school
[2:19:44] <%Brassnarwhal> @patstaresat someone spoiled it for me in your chat yesterday too
[2:19:46] <T_Sasquatch> Can someone pm it plz
[2:19:49] <%cade_calrayn> It's after the next boss, Pat, we'll tell you when you can reach it
[2:19:49] <coziestbank> Can't you just make the item that makes more messeges appear instead?
[2:19:49] <AdmiralButtloaf> Pat did you find the Dragon Shield Talisman (30% damage reduction)?
[2:19:50] <yyyyfdugyu> i cannot believe marika was scrimblo all along
[2:19:54] <%sporeian94> you need galaxy brain
[2:19:56] <zzNamttamzz> Towards next boss
[2:19:58] <%Willowight> whats a double respec
[2:20:00] <T_Sasquatch> If no one is going to say it
[2:20:00] <%crimsonharvest> are we in the east edge of the capital city
[2:20:01] <rReizs> dont even need respecs depending on what items you have
[2:20:02] <kazadaz> Well I haven't been spoiled yet so I'm outskies, soz
[2:20:03] <coziestbank> Craft the messege item instead
[2:20:07] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt getting to the statue requires defeating the first boss of this zone
[2:20:07] <Zombrocom> I sure hope no one spoiled the other thing.
[2:20:08] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt up the roots is progress, down the roots is another optional area
[2:20:11] <%greasypete00> jump 4Head
[2:20:11] <+SaintSalted> i didnt see goldmask one time in my playthrough
[2:20:12] <Sunstalker> You need to pick up a tome first, it's somewhere in the capital iirc?
[2:20:13] <%cade_calrayn> UM wait I'VE NOT SEEN THAT AREA
[2:20:20] <%Brassnarwhal> it's chill, your mods do a great job

[2:20:35] <Sunstalker> Back down at the stone
[2:20:38] <%cade_calrayn> back at the rampart you fought the gargoyle
[2:20:38] <FrostedZaibatsu> Where do roots start?
[2:20:40] <Dopamien> you find the root of the roots
[2:20:43] <oda_flobunaga> on your left
[2:20:49] <NewWillinium> You get on the roots right here
[2:20:52] <ralphfromdk> So... sony thing starts in like 15, right?

[2:21:12] <FrostedZaibatsu> LUL
[2:21:12] <Guardiansaiyan> lol
[2:21:17] <%twistedj3ster> It was also not great
[2:21:18] <ralphfromdk> god damn me and my time zones...

[2:21:20] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> We got a time traveler here
[2:21:21] <+oneimportantthing> I'm further ahead and without spoiling anything this game just keeps opening up every time I think it's done
[2:21:22] <%SirGO0SE> i got semi softlocked in caelid where you get the nox whip sword thing yesterday because i skyrim'd up the side of a mountain to get there

[2:21:29] <%Mantorok06> Remember when Pat said he was going to the sewers, fun times
[2:21:30] <ohno58> Never though Valkyrie profile would get another game.
[2:21:30] <lyzejag> Bruh
[2:21:34] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I liked the Sony thing
[2:21:34] <zanzibarian_hamster> He's a timezone behind, it will be for him

[2:26:05] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt purple item on the floor deeper into the room.
[2:26:05] <+Beetlewins> So what is the 'canon' armor in this game you think? like how fluted was for Demon's and Elite was for Dark Souls 1 and Alva's for 2?

[2:26:56] <lyzejag> #RipBozo
[2:27:02] <+wizard_of_diamonds> ... in fact, this looks exactly like the lower level of the Roundtable where you can fight him
[2:27:06] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater i mean you also missed that scene that I so graciously went and recorded for you because i'm just such an awesome guy like that Kappa
[2:27:07] <+wizard_of_diamonds> wtf
[2:27:10] <%crimsonharvest> oh i didnt see that
[2:27:10] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt So your weapons are sorted by type, how are your armors sorted? It looks like there is a certain grouping.
[2:27:11] <spawnzie> i do apreciate this game's selection of wizardly hats
[2:27:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> right clicked
[2:27:17] <NewWillinium> It absolutely does look cool with the Wolf Head
[2:27:19] <jumpyhugs> y'all fashion backseaters

[2:27:46] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt a bunch of the rooms in there have cool shit in them
[2:27:48] <SinisterBroccoli> is it still possible to get that armor if I killed rykard before I finished the volcano manor quest?
[2:27:48] <+Rofiarf> yes
[2:27:54] <+Akizea> all the doors you come in here are doors that are shut in the regular hold btw, just a cool detail
[2:28:08] <@QueequegTheater> the boy prances
[2:28:12] <$realm_forge> Every time pat streams he’s got a new weapon or armor piece I wanna make
[2:28:17] <athuramn> so the raging wolf armor is worn by one of the first tarnished to reach the round table, so worlds are in parallel?
[2:28:18] <%cade_calrayn> Space
[2:28:25] <%cade_calrayn> The Abyss
[2:28:30] <%RealThiele> Moon?
[2:28:36] <zenith0111> It circles back to DS1
[2:28:39] <HeroToxiko> So the hub is a magic lie?

[2:29:36] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt it's worth noting that when Gideon talks about being one of the OG round table members he probably means the ORIGINAL round table that actually existed before the shattering

[2:30:14] <spawnzie> I think it's the skill
[2:30:15] <+twdlrr> it does say unblockable blade
[2:30:15] <DusK_The_Stray> Probably the one called Unblockable Blade

[2:30:38] <RubberFistFight> he died of ligma
[2:30:38] <zzNamttamzz> Special is unblockable, most shields don't block 100% holy
[2:30:40] <Sunstalker> Just test it, chat can't be trusted
[2:30:42] <%crimsonharvest> so they gave it the shotel tag?
[2:30:42] <RubberFistFight> it's so sad
[2:30:43] <zenith0111> chat ure dumb
[2:30:46] <@QueequegTheater> Chat war chat war
[2:30:46] <+thickshield> it only does holy damage so blocking it is less effective
[2:30:46] <+Beetlewins> only every other attack
[2:30:46] <$realm_forge> I HAVE A PHYSICAL NEED TO MAKE THAT SWORD HOLY SHIT
[2:30:48] <%JustToWatch> the holy scripture

[2:30:53] <lyzejag> Who's Jobs
[2:30:57] <TioXyco> steve jobs is an asshole who thought stealing ideas was good, if only not his
[2:30:59] <%crimsonharvest> look they fuckin left him here
[2:31:01] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt this implies Dung Eater was an original member btw
[2:31:04] <%discoinfierno> I'm looking forward to mods that make it say things like "scrimbolus bimbolus"
[2:31:04] <+Grayhammatter> the loathsome dung eater
[2:31:06] <DestroPrime83> What do you mean OTHER?
[2:31:06] <%Valdorick> Did he blow that guy!?
[2:31:09] <Guardiansaiyan> @realm_forge there are blacksmiths for that
[2:31:13] <Zombrocom> You should read that thing
[2:31:15] <+Beetlewins> poop fuckers room
[2:31:16] <%Daskolin> @PatStaresAt Damage go through shield with its holly reduction. Weapon skill ignores it
[2:31:18] <@QueequegTheater> He pooed on him
[2:31:19] <yyyyfdugyu> the poop consumer
[2:31:21] <RemedyofRevenge> @PatStaresAt to be precising, the weapon art is fully unblockable, but since the regular attacks deal no physical damage and just holy, it usually bleed through blocks a bunch
[2:31:33] <+KipTheSmuggler> @PatStaresAt Pat do you dream of the lands between when you sleep
[2:31:38] <bassoontyphoon> He eat da poopoo
[2:31:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> The Repugnant Fecus Feaster
[2:31:41] <athuramn> so he tied some dude up and cursed AND perma invaded his world?
[2:31:43] <Khester824> what level is pat?
[2:31:48] <DestroPrime83> is this some time shenaniganes?
[2:31:50] <@QueequegTheater> What if it has a different description like the umbilical cords in BB?
[2:31:51] <Delta5931> 154
[2:31:57] <%RealThiele> He kills you then goes after your death poop like a soft serve machine
[2:32:04] <mrcelab> So Fortified manor
[2:32:06] <$realm_forge> @guardiansaiyan I make props so every time pat gets something cool I add it to my project list lol
[2:32:06] <andrewoid_> hunters dream baby!!
[2:32:13] <bluefootedtpeack> nah ofnr says the hold is from outside space and time, it's like the hunters dream
[2:32:13] <Khester824> yup just saw
[2:32:15] <spawnzie> time shenanigans in souls? NO WAY
[2:32:19] <%livi242> can you talk to Gideon about it
[2:32:20] <NewWillinium> I think it's less time and more *space* shenanigans? Like. . . Pocket Dimensions not Space Spacec
[2:32:24] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater wait, does it? I didn't even think to check that.
[2:32:28] <RemedyofRevenge> is that why the dung eater kills people? Cause you shit yourself after dying? @PatStaresAt
[2:32:28] <42nfl19> No pat, its just FromSoft reusing assets again ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[2:32:29] <@QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight idk
[2:32:36] <Guardiansaiyan> @realm_forge now I am jealous... I can only make some drawings and things...you make MASTER SWORDS
[2:32:39] <%TG_Cid11> @PatStaresAt I thought more of a bloodborne thing

[2:32:45] <ohno58> I just ran past hese assholes
[2:32:46] <%RealThiele> i mean Souls games acknowledge theres multiple worlds
[2:32:50] <it_came_from_outer_space> These things should just be gardening robots tbh

[2:33:56] <RubberFistFight> @bluefootedtpeack Massively, they take like 3x as much damage
[2:33:56] <42nfl19> a WIN is a WIN
[2:34:13] <rosabellamelantha> @bluefootedtpeack they take 2x the damage yes
[2:34:13] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt They can grab you through those walls btw
[2:34:16] <yyyyfdugyu> get bouldered
[2:34:18] <ohno58> her comes the boiiii

[2:34:24] <$realm_forge> Pat casts rock
[2:34:25] <JoshyJay> ah yes the powerful magic of chucking a big ass rock
[2:34:29] <jumpyhugs> yoooo how many deathroots do I need for those rocks?
[2:34:36] <TrollKing96> I can only imagine how nuts the modding scene for this game will be.
[2:34:36] <RubberFistFight> @discoinfierno "This MILF wants to give you a hug (guess what she has on under her robes?)"
[2:34:43] <+Jeshk0> no u
[2:34:47] <bluefootedtpeack> nice, i like how they and the flamethrower head tanks have their little weaknesses.
[2:34:48] <%crimsonharvest> i super cheesed a boss around here from through a fog wall felt good to disrespect him like that
[2:34:55] <NewWillinium> *Cheers*  I just have a single boss left in the game finally. Now I can watch the Stream in peace
[2:35:00] <$realm_forge> Awww he looked sad when you said that
[2:35:02] <spawnzie> cool weapon art
[2:35:03] <+LandOfTheWay> CAN YOU FEEL THE STORM
[2:35:24] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I'm convinced this is supposed to be part of Nepheli's quest.
[2:35:25] <Baeltyr> cant you find one of those axes in that first area
[2:35:30] <RubberFistFight> @NewWillinium did you defeat the Queen of Broken-ass Bullshit?
[2:35:33] <DusK_The_Stray> Now the real game begins
[2:35:33] <pi_in_the_sci> Why do I feel like hero girl should be given that axe
[2:35:40] <tolloponik> WOW thats insane
[2:35:51] <%JoshManVGH> Visions of left, ahead
[2:35:52] <Dopamien> vaati explain NotLikeThis
[2:35:53] <%Brassnarwhal> @patstaresat the blood slash weapon art can hit through walls for free, you can use it to avoid getting locked in with the wind knight in stormveil, it's pretty bullshit
[2:36:04] <NewWillinium> @RubberFistFight I did! Took me over an entire night, and taking a break until just not fighting off every other boss in the game that was left, but I finally beat her
[2:36:04] <%cade_calrayn> Huh.... the Tower of *Return* takes you here, doesn't it, Pat?
[2:36:05] <%SveriSageAdvice> now that you have taken the elevator up, the portal is active
[2:36:05] <RubberFistFight> pfffft
[2:36:06] <42nfl19> your tried
[2:36:06] <+Jeshk0> LUL
[2:36:08] <samuelfisk> That Lady Conan loves Hawks more than Griffith

[2:36:11] <zenith0111> LUL
[2:36:13] <depressioncherrie> LUL LUL
[2:36:14] <oda_flobunaga> Good job breaking it hero
[2:36:15] <%crimsonharvest> oh i have no idea why, but when i was ready to run this zone that elevator's top lever worked for me
[2:36:15] <Sunstalker> LuL how even
[2:36:15] <TwistParabola> LUL
[2:36:17] <eleskei> hey now
[2:36:19] <@QueequegTheater> Great hob
[2:36:19] <%Brassnarwhal> you can also hit people climbing ladders with it through the ground
[2:36:20] <JoshyJay> worth for the knowing
[2:36:22] <%whyskeywolfe> oh.
[2:36:30] <jubejube56> Architecture
[2:36:43] <NewWillinium> Also man Faith got ALL of the love in this game. I feel neglected as a Int Magic user
[2:36:46] <RubberFistFight> @NewWillinium any pointers on how to avoid the absolute horsecrap she unleashes at the start of phase 2? Coz that's a OHKO for me despite having 50 in vit.
[2:36:53] <%Maids4lyfe> why wouldn't they?
[2:36:53] <%furiousfurioso> fun fact I couldn't figure out how to get in here, turns out at some point the elevator just unlocks at the top
[2:37:12] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt there's a waygate at the top there that was closed when you teleported there from the belfry.
[2:37:15] <RubberFistFight> might wanna check that out.
[2:37:18] <Scrumdreew> isnt there a teleporter at the top of that
[2:37:23] <%crimsonharvest> it does, yeah, but i had 2 other ways to get in by that point
[2:37:27] <%furiousfurioso> he's already used the waygate
[2:37:28] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @RubberFistFight He did that last stream.
[2:37:30] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt please tell me that was at Paige and not at Gief
[2:37:31] <%DeadRuins> @PatStaresAt i don't know if you did it or not but do you want to know how to get a BUSTED shield or no?
[2:37:32] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[2:37:35] <+TheBitingIrish> @NewWillinium There are a shit-ton of weapons with int scaling, more than faith that I've seen
[2:37:37] <RubberFistFight> oh, really?
[2:37:42] <NewWillinium> @RubberFistFight Basically just Run forward as soon as the cutscene ends, and only lock back onto her after you hear the crash.
[2:37:42] <%crimsonharvest> oh whats the trick with that waygate?
[2:37:44] <mike2hands> Hi PEACH :D
[2:37:49] <NewWillinium> Works like a charm
[2:37:52] <AthenaAegis> Orc dog
[2:37:54] <Ner234> Pet the doggo
[2:37:55] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @crimsonharvest Just progress far enough, apparently.
[2:37:55] <%Brassnarwhal> @newwillinium there are like a hundred thousand sorceries, i have gone out of my way to collect incants and been ignoring spells and i have more spells than incants, also faith needed it more it's been trash in every single game sorcery has always been viable
[2:37:56] <Midnight188> whats a good early faith weapon for ER?
[2:38:02] <RubberFistFight> @NewWillinium aight i'll try that.
[2:38:04] <@QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight Just dodge lmao Kappa
[2:38:07] <NewWillinium> @TheBitingIrish I meant more in terms of cool spells.
[2:38:10] <RubberFistFight> yeeaaah the fingering room
[2:38:21] <%kknutson4> Halo Scythe
[2:38:28] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater quiet, you. my only dodges are panic dodges.
[2:38:28] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Midnight188 You can get an Ash of War called Sacred Blade in Limgrave that makes any weapon a Faith weapon.
[2:38:28] <zenith0111> Whats confusing?
[2:38:34] <reasonance> you can get the sacred blade war ash really early and put it on whatever
[2:38:37] <%Brassnarwhal> @midnight188 I've been using the tree sentinel halberd for the entire game and got it right at the beginning
[2:38:49] <%Brassnarwhal> winged scythe
[2:38:52] <@QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight Shields are pacifiers
[2:38:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PART 2 YEYEYEYEEYEY
[2:38:55] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt the secret bosses basically
[2:38:57] <+TheBitingIrish> @NewWillinium Yeah, it seems most sorceries are 'previous spell but stronger'
[2:39:02] <RubberFistFight> Since I apparently missed a stream - did pat beat Literally Blood Satan yet?
[2:39:05] <%cade_calrayn> well, we know where Miquella is, lol
[2:39:07] <+LandOfTheWay> think we know where 2 of those are
[2:39:10] <NewWillinium> @Brassnarwhal Most of which are similar to what we've had in prior games. Meanwhile Faith has gone absolutely WILD in terms of spells and what not.
[2:39:14] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater i don't use a shield.
[2:39:17] <+Beetlewins> I bet the Lord of Blood is a chill guy
[2:39:20] <+Jeshk0> Blood for The Blood Lord!!
[2:39:26] <@QueequegTheater> All but one of them
[2:39:27] <NewWillinium> We've met at least two of them.
[2:39:36] <+678saintglock> lord of blood is a creepo
[2:39:43] <NewWillinium> Oh hell I completely missed this dialogue
[2:39:45] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt i might have missed it but did you go back and fight Literally Blood Satan again yet?
[2:39:47] <%Brassnarwhal> @newwillinium the gavel and the starting spell for the prisoner are by far my favorite things to cast in the game tbh
[2:39:51] <%JoshManVGH> O H! HE'S THE EAR GUY FROM THE TRAILER
[2:39:53] <zenith0111> I love this Old man
[2:39:54] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I really wish Gideon's armor was silver instead of gray. It matches literally nothing else in the game.
[2:39:54] <%Valdorick> @Brassnarwhal There's not even a Lightning Spear upgrade... and Lightning infusion is Dex scaling, not faith... feels bad
[2:39:57] <lyzejag> Holy shit he's angry lmao
[2:40:00] <zenith0111> He sounds so tired
[2:40:01] <+sandwich_jones> reptile rampage
[2:40:03] <%JoshManVGH> I only just got that!
[2:40:04] <%cade_calrayn> Mohgwyn calls Miquella his lover in the item descriptions... creepy as fuck
[2:40:23] <rosabellamelantha> @cade_calrayn Miquella is also an eternal child due to his curse so
[2:40:25] <NewWillinium> @Brassnarwhal Less the Gavel for me, and more the Cannon of Haima. It is my absolute FAVORITE non-blade spell
[2:40:27] <RubberFistFight> @cade_calrayn yeah it's pretty screwed up.
[2:40:27] <oda_flobunaga> Ereptile Disfunction?
[2:40:35] <@QueequegTheater> Amphibian Apocalypse
[2:40:35] <%Brassnarwhal> @newwillinium that's because faith had like 3 attack spells and a handful of utilities, faith was playing catch up cause it was neglected

[2:41:00] <pi_in_the_sci> what does the cookbook make?
[2:41:00] <rosabellamelantha> and for extra fucked up-ness it's HEAVILY implied Miquella and Malenia were banging so incest on top of that too

[2:41:45] <bassoontyphoon> Herpetology Homewreckage
[2:41:52] <RubberFistFight> One way to check is put a message down, do the whole thing like in untended graves/firelinl

[2:47:23] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt What do you think the modding scene is gonna be like for this game?
[2:47:24] <RubberFistFight> @Valdorick you should include the bit where because Miquella refused his advances, Mohg murdered him and stuffed him into a tree-egg-thing to try and rez him in a state of mind-control.
[2:47:30] <rosabellamelantha> @678saintglock Yep! look gods love incest apparently

[2:50:05] <%strakillias> The SECOND you opened your mouth Pat
[2:50:10] <AlexJacobVO> Ghosts can't rot, Pat
[2:50:11] <RubberFistFight> @Valdorick does the idea of "childhood" even MEAN ANYTHING when you're dealing with an eternal god creature? I feel like it needs a different metric of measurement.
[2:50:11] <%whyskeywolfe> It's not even the real worm.
[2:50:14] <FrostedZaibatsu> This guy was so easy
[2:50:14] <%twistedj3ster> one thing I've noticed is that devs put so many nooks in they can't always provide a nice reward for exploring them
[2:50:15] <%Valdorick> He's a ghost, and thus immune to the Rot.
[2:50:18] <tolloponik> @reasonance I pressed enter too early I meant porn mods
[2:50:20] <ape_hawk> i dont think you can scarlet rot a ghost, pat
[2:50:22] <Jontman42> HE'S A COOL FUCKING GUY THO
[2:50:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> merely a phantasm

[2:51:06] <+sandwich_jones> nah u gotta do it again
[2:51:08] <%luftraumm1> heavy build now?
[2:51:08] <Baeltyr> that was underwhelming
[2:51:14] <%zarkazeon> pat there's a legendary armament around here and it's kind of silly to get but it's missable
[2:51:15] <nelsonq415> I thought he was supposed to b a badass, that was quick
[2:51:17] <reasonance> he's not hard even at normal levels
[2:51:18] <tolloponik> now fight the real wone the room over
[2:51:23] <%Valdorick> Roots are progress once again.
[2:51:24] <jubejube56> Congrats you are elden lord now
[2:51:28] <+5Two> I'm starting to understand what people mean by you being stupidly overpowered.
[2:51:31] <42nfl19> Is pat overleveled? or is he a Chump? I can't tell anymore @PatStaresAt
[2:51:42] <+sandwich_jones> reach out and touch grace
[2:51:46] <RubberFistFight> @nelsonq415 turns out gods fall fast if you've got a 100% shield, high stamina and a big sword, and are overlevelled Kappa
[2:51:48] <%RealThiele> roll credits
[2:51:50] <FrostedZaibatsu> what level is pat?
[2:51:54] <Omenaire_> LUL
[2:51:55] <@QueequegTheater> Yes it is
[2:51:56] <@QueequegTheater> You are
[2:52:02] <%AnthroMetal> yes, but no
[2:52:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> idk it seems pretty clear
[2:52:04] <lyzejag> Nah this boss is easy, and he is
[2:52:06] <%cade_calrayn> Statue of Radagon is out the other exit of that room, FYI
[2:52:06] <TwistParabola> he's overleveled but it's not going to save him
[2:52:07] <@QueequegTheater> You are 50 levels above the average
[2:52:08] <+678saintglock> it’s pretty clear
[2:52:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> hes not late game is a MF
[2:52:10] <blue8moon> pat is both underpowerd and overpowered, he lives in power limbo
[2:52:12] <reasonance> only by like... 40-50 levels or so
[2:52:15] <+sandwich_jones> doesn't he have like 5 stats at 40?
[2:52:15] <$MinoMiushi> Even getting 100% I barely got to lvl 150
[2:52:15] <+RedMaskBandit> @frostedzaibatsu it says 154
[2:52:16] <%TheGuesty> LobosJr did 180-ish with full STR build, so it's fine
[2:52:19] <%twistedj3ster> I like seeing these cool graphics basically showing of the Pika Pika no Mi
[2:52:19] <TwistParabola> LUL
[2:52:20] <%zarkazeon> in fact you can see weapon from most places in the city
[2:52:20] <Omenaire_> theres a lot left so
[2:52:21] <Ravioli_Ronin> Is this a bleed build?
[2:52:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[2:52:23] <rReizs> tiche is also crazy strong
[2:52:24] <+abrupt_abe> What level is pat?
[2:52:24] <+beansoup> What is pats level?
[2:52:25] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater the ladies like that though Kappa
[2:52:26] <kingra> You are overleveled and no one cares cause it's fun
[2:52:29] <%luftraumm1> zarkzeon said theres a missabçe çegendary ar,a,emt here @PatStaresAt
[2:52:31] <%tetraes> @QueequegTheater  i had so much trouble with this place i hit 120 before3 that fight lol
[2:52:32] <lyzejag> No YOU shut up tho
[2:52:32] <FrostedZaibatsu> @RedMaskBandit damn boy
[2:52:33] <NewWillinium> Pat's probably going to get at least another 15 levels by the end of this. I'm sitting at level 151 *now* at the end of the game. There's plenty of Runes left to get
[2:52:33] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> being overly huge is a valid playstyle
[2:52:35] <+twdlrr> Pat is offering a "streamlined experience"
[2:52:36] <bleugh> gooderer
[2:52:38] <pi_in_the_sci> why didn't you check the other gazebo out there?
[2:52:43] <%Aeoneth> The camera removes about 20 levels
[2:52:47] <slimslimjim88> PotFriend
[2:52:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> pats like 154
[2:52:50] <oda_flobunaga> Well, he only took me like 2 attempts on 15 vigor and 70 levels lower, so I'd lean towards chump more than champ
[2:52:50] <$MinoMiushi> Yeah there's a missable spear
[2:52:55] <+beansoup> i beat the game at level 130
[2:52:55] <@QueequegTheater> @Aeoneth holy shit
[2:52:58] <@QueequegTheater> I'm rolling
[2:53:01] <FrostedZaibatsu> I was like 80-90 here
[2:53:04] <+leyk36> Tiche just makes most fights in the game a joke
[2:53:05] <jubejube56> Influencer levels
[2:53:06] <%RealThiele> missed the siderroom on the weay out
[2:53:06] <Baeltyr> to hell?
[2:53:06] <Big_Dream> plsying the game and exploring everything just happens to get you lvled up for most things if you do bosss fights last
[2:53:13] <+SuperMrSkully> Let's be fair, you're overleveled but I think you're supposed to be at this point
[2:53:14] <tolloponik> being over leveled in some cases doesn't even mater for some bosses
[2:53:16] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt there's the statue
[2:53:16] <Big_Dream> so meh
[2:53:19] <42nfl19> TPOSE
[2:53:22] <Alrom> there is the statue, eys
[2:53:23] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt ye
[2:53:23] <+sandwich_jones> margit gud
[2:53:24] <%Saadi90> I was around level 90 at this part
[2:53:24] <bluefootedtpeack> just dump any excess levels into arcane for the increased drop chance if you're worried about having to high stats.
[2:53:27] <%RealThiele> Try ranged fight ahead
[2:53:34] <%TheGuesty> jojo pose ending
[2:53:36] <oda_flobunaga> WHO COULD THIS BE?
[2:53:36] <RubberFistFight> Pat is absolutely the kind of guy who used the rare candy cheat in Pokemanz because he needed to be big huge tough guy. That's ok though, coz I also did that. LUL
[2:53:36] <42nfl19> TPOSE, DOMINANCE
[2:53:36] <rosabellamelantha> it's for goldmasks quest
[2:53:37] <%cade_calrayn> It tells you something
[2:53:37] <$sarah_galb> tell you something
[2:53:38] <NewWillinium> Huh. I'll have to remember this in my next playthrough
[2:53:38] <bluefootedtpeack> you get something
[2:53:39] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> t pose god
[2:53:40] <%tetraes> @PatStaresAt  its for quest fort na ending
[2:53:43] <Alrom> It tells you something

[2:53:45] <@QueequegTheater> Quest progress
[2:53:46] <+Rofiarf> it continues the goldmask quest
[2:53:49] <depressioncherrie> it tells oyu something and you can progress the Goldmask quest
[2:53:51] <iteruq> and show something
[2:53:53] <TwistParabola> it's for goldmask's quests
[2:53:53] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> you need to continue the goldmask
[2:53:54] <%bundle_of_herbs> @patstaresat did you ever talk to sellen again after getting the spell from that silent guy?
[2:54:04] <coziestbank> Just craft the item that does the same thing
[2:54:06] <%BonewheelVanguard> now that statue literally just depicts Tree Jesus
[2:54:07] <RubberFistFight> is it just me or are the items for respeccing super common?
[2:54:08] <ape_hawk> the spoiler doesnt even reveal anything shocking
[2:54:11] <jubejube56> Oh so you weren’t spoiled on how to solve it
[2:54:13] <+lord_sykos> Progresses goldmask quest
[2:54:15] <ape_hawk> i was like "who cares?"
[2:54:17] <JDlightside> LTG was 124 at the start of the game, still took him like 10 tries to beat Godrick.
[2:54:20] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Which Sellen?
[2:54:23] <+RedMaskBandit> meh, if you're having fun then who cares if you're over-leveled. everyone has the opportunity to become big and strong
[2:54:24] <Baeltyr> flash
[2:54:24] <depressioncherrie> climb on the spear to your left
[2:54:24] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You can also jump onto giant spear to get giant spear
[2:54:31] <Baeltyr> i like his spear
[2:54:34] <%RealThiele> free weapon
[2:54:34] <@QueequegTheater> @JDlightside LTG is bad at video games though
[2:54:34] <yyyyfdugyu> sellen deez nutz
[2:54:35] <lethallylactic> Did Pat get the item on that golden spear?
[2:54:36] <+leyk36> It allows you to progress his quest further
[2:54:37] <42nfl19> DID HE JUST SLOWLY WALK UP
[2:54:41] <Baeltyr> mace?
[2:54:42] <%Valdorick> Holy shit, destroyed
[2:54:45] <FrostedZaibatsu> @JDlightside It doesnt matter the level. Its the skill
[2:54:46] <%JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt you don't need to respec, you can do it through items alone
[2:54:47] <RubberFistFight> @hraezlyrnoyaiba it's the same sellen in both places. one's a magical projection.
[2:54:47] <%discoinfierno> They need to do a Nier Automata thing where From does gameplay and anyone else does story imho
[2:54:52] <42nfl19> DRILL
[2:54:53] <%RealThiele> big poise boi
[2:54:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O
[2:55:00] <T_Sasquatch> Yikes

[2:55:00] <+Grayhammatter> whoa
[2:55:02] <@QueequegTheater> @JDlightside Get To A Bonfire Kappa
[2:55:02] <KyberNasse> Is that the gargoyle blackblade? Is it good?
[2:55:07] <%sniffy77> gottem
[2:55:07] <%Valdorick> Saved it!
[2:55:10] <Gamer76255> Don't  need to respec just buff int with armor,talisman  and flask
[2:55:10] <superzebra101> that enemy was harder than the boss lol
[2:55:10] <heartlesshealer> Almost through the stairs!
[2:55:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> sick
[2:55:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> what the fuck is that attack, i have never seen that
[2:55:11] <FrostedZaibatsu> Bet that grab is going to be used for a skip
[2:55:12] <@QueequegTheater> DS2 SAYS HELLO
[2:55:13] <T_Sasquatch> Man black knights still kick ass
[2:55:14] <%imthewisejanitor> Anyone else see the guy who beat Elden Ring in 3 hours without dying
[2:55:16] <+Grayhammatter> that stab did a lot of damage
[2:55:18] <Ethel9727> @discoinfierno Apparently Taro and Miyazaki are friends. So the dream is possible
[2:55:22] <+RedMaskBandit> u have int boosting gear that bypasses the spells req without needing to respec
[2:55:22] <Sunstalker> @KyberNasse Yeah but got it get it from a hard boss
[2:55:23] <Explodincatz> I wanted him to throw u through the stairs
[2:55:23] <+Beetlewins> good lord that grab is nasty
[2:55:26] <lethallylactic> Yes
[2:55:27] <%SveriSageAdvice> i've only seen the wings shit, not the glowy dagger grab
[2:55:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> can you climb the big stick?
[2:55:30] <%zarkazeon> weapon ahead
[2:55:37] <coziestbank> @PatStaresAt There is a craftable item that is the same as the messege reveal spell
[2:55:43] <bluefootedtpeack> you shouldn't need to respec for the quest progression with the statue, i could do the incantation as a sorc with like 20 faith.
[2:55:45] <FrostedZaibatsu> @PatStaresAt Have you found the Golden Shower yet?
[2:55:45] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Am I crazy or do Crucible Knights feel like DS2 enemies
[2:55:54] <%Valdorick> Script something?
[2:55:54] <heartlesshealer> I love that it showed an item as soon as Pat asked that
[2:56:04] <KyberNasse> Yeah I have it, not sure if its worth to +10 it
[2:56:09] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Warming Stones are craftable.
[2:56:10] <Midnight188> DS2 enemies that ate their wheaties mby
[2:56:12] <TwistParabola> scriptstone i think
[2:56:23] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt You CAN suvive that
[2:56:25] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater you're crazy for thinking they're the only ones. There's a FUCKTON of DS2 enemies in this game.
[2:56:31] <%Valdorick> Scriptstone, that it
[2:56:35] <Sunstalker> Its not gonna kill you, Pat. Could always use the cat talisman
[2:56:36] <+RedMaskBandit> u can land on this spear
[2:56:37] <Augus7717> you can survive that fall @PatStaresAt
[2:56:39] <%Brassnarwhal> incorrect
[2:56:44] <%Brassnarwhal> scriptstones
[2:56:44] <TwistParabola> Scriptstone
[2:56:53] <@QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight But these ones in particular feel like Tanimura getting revenge on the DS2 skippers
[2:56:58] <+beansoup> goddamn level 154
[2:57:00] <lethallylactic> Drop a pebble to see if you'll survive the fall
[2:57:00] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Oh, my bad.
[2:57:00] <%SveriSageAdvice> you need the Missionary's Cookbook (2)
[2:57:03] <%RealThiele> Scrimblostone
[2:57:04] <TwistParabola> craftable
[2:57:08] <$realm_forge> Bimblostones
[2:57:13] <+LuckyHitman> the recipe is sold by Patches
[2:57:19] <coziestbank> the one patch's sells
[2:57:19] <%Valdorick> There it is!
[2:57:21] <%SveriSageAdvice> cookbook is in the info tab all the way in the back
[2:57:23] <bluefootedtpeack> wait what am i missing, why don't you just use the incantation when you get it, you ahve more than the necessary stats to use it.
[2:57:25] <%Brassnarwhal> it's from one of the holy crafting books i think
[2:57:26] <heartlesshealer> ah, the liar shop
[2:57:26] <+RedMaskBandit> scriptstone
[2:57:37] <oda_flobunaga> Man, its going to take the Haligtree to really kick his shit in isn't it?
[2:57:39] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt do it where the dev message is
[2:57:43] <42nfl19> wait whats the point of an item to spawn in more floor messages?
[2:57:43] <$Jaxnos> if this works imma be tight
[2:57:44] <sendart> @bluefootedtpeack the incantation that needs int?
[2:57:46] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> for this questline? that'd be weird
[2:57:47] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @bluefootedtpeack The incantation required needs 37 Int to cast.
[2:57:47] <+LuckyHitman> @bluefootedtpeack The incantation uses Intelligence
[2:57:50] <%Brassnarwhal> @bluefootedtpeack waste of a slot
[2:58:01] <lethallylactic> Jebaited ?
[2:58:02] <Jontman42> ?
[2:58:03] <$Jaxnos> punk ass liars
[2:58:09] <42nfl19> ?
[2:58:11] <reasonance> you can stack a ton of int boosts to cast it even if you only have like 8 int
[2:58:11] <oda_flobunaga> Nope
[2:58:13] <rosabellamelantha> that should have worked?
[2:58:14] <+Grayhammatter> Jebaited ?
[2:58:14] <bluefootedtpeack> oh it needs int, that's why i could do it as a sorcerer, makes sense thought it was just low fiath
[2:58:14] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> one guy :(
[2:58:19] <%cade_calrayn> What's your INT level, Pat? You should be able to use items and equipment to get to 37
[2:58:22] <$sarah_galb> you need the incantation
[2:58:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[2:58:24] <lethallylactic> lionDoubtit
[2:58:25] <tengel66> you use a "regression"spell there, bought frpm the NPC with goldmask
[2:58:28] <%whyskeywolfe> @patstaresat You gotta do it from the dev message.
[2:58:31] <oda_flobunaga> Juan Guy
[2:58:31] <Jontman42> no it shouldn't have LUL
[2:58:36] <$bcdenton> stand on the message and use Law of Regression
[2:58:38] <%tetraes> just put on all ur intbooster
[2:58:39] <%whyskeywolfe> It does yeah
[2:58:43] <depressioncherrie> I would have been very surprised if this works
[2:58:43] <RubberFistFight> @whyskeywolfe he literally did though.
[2:58:58] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> are yall lying?
[2:59:00] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh no i think you only had the one scriptstone
[2:59:01] <+Tevvy> you need to cast law of regression its a spell not an item.
[2:59:05] <tengel66> it requires 37 INT though
[2:59:05] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh thank god
[2:59:05] <%tsuchi7> that is such a weird secret, requiring an incantation to get it
[2:59:06] <+PkSilent01> How many Lords did Pat Slain?
[2:59:09] <%Valdorick> I don't think Pat has enough int boosters to reach 37 from *9*
[2:59:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> literally says "Regression alone" NotLikeThis
[2:59:11] <@QueequegTheater> If only you could find them
[2:59:13] <@QueequegTheater> @PkSilent01 3
[2:59:14] <%whyskeywolfe> @patstaresat No you were right, you need the incantation first.
[2:59:14] <%Agami23> it needs the incantation
[2:59:16] <mantyz> is not a item
[2:59:17] <+sandwich_jones> is summon jellyfish good?
[2:59:20] <$bcdenton> you have to use Law of Regressio
[2:59:23] <+Kyma1020> has to be the law of regression incantation
[2:59:24] <digaogrunge> The item doesnt do anything Pat
[2:59:24] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> come on one guy
[2:59:26] <@QueequegTheater> Good job chat
[2:59:26] <%Nobrev> you need the incantation, yeah
[2:59:28] <rReizs> thanks twitch chat
[2:59:28] <%tsuchi7> gotta find the spell
[2:59:28] <RubberFistFight> @whyskeywolfe oh no looks like you're the one guy.
[2:59:30] <KyberNasse> fextralife one guy
[2:59:32] <+Grayhammatter> one guy
[2:59:32] <%tsuchi7> is nearby
[2:59:33] <+NopeBadguy> what sword is that?
[2:59:35] <oda_flobunaga> Juan Guy
[2:59:35] <depressioncherrie> I mean it says "Regression ALONE reveals the secret"
[2:59:35] <heartlesshealer> :|
[2:59:36] <FrostedZaibatsu> @sandwich_jones Early game yes
[2:59:36] <@QueequegTheater> @whyskeywolfe What have you done
[2:59:37] <$bcdenton> temporarily respect
[2:59:41] <$bcdenton> *respec
[2:59:45] <%TheGuesty> "Was there a "switch action" option?
[2:59:45] <%Agami23> theres a bunch of gear you can equip to raise int by a bunch
[2:59:50] <coziestbank> is it within "tailisman range"?
[2:59:51] <%tsuchi7> you can use items and godrick's rune to cast it
[2:59:52] <%whyskeywolfe> Wait what what did I do
[2:59:52] <RubberFistFight> fucking everyone is saying "you need the incantation pat, the stone won't work" and he listens to the one guy insisting it does EVEN WHEN IT DIDN'T WORK.
[2:59:55] <bluefootedtpeack> ah so that's why goldmask is stumped by it, he's a faith guy so he can't see it
[2:59:55] <reasonance> you can get plenty of boosts from items to get it
[2:59:56] <ape_hawk> you know where to get the incantation, pat?
[2:59:58] <jubejube56> The good news is that you are the only human to ever use that item now
[2:59:59] <+Beetlewins> can you rune your stats up and use a boost int talisman?
[3:00:00] <%RealThiele> cheat that INT
[3:00:01] <+NopeBadguy> yo, what's your hour count for this game right now, just curious
[3:00:01] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You have a bunch of INT raising gear
[3:00:02] <%JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt you can reach the int requirement with items
[3:00:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeyeye climb the stick
[3:00:02] <%pabloelenano2> un wey
[3:00:06] <%SveriSageAdvice> why on earth did they make a intelligence spell required for the faith questline
[3:00:11] <%Dakuu75> What’s suppose to happen?
[3:00:13] <Gamer76255> @PatStaresAt Your Wonderous Flask, Armor and Talismans can get you to the Int you need
[3:00:14] <NewWillinium> Bolt of Gransax?
[3:00:16] <depressioncherrie> Ah, Bolt of Gainax
[3:00:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> Bolt of Bugsnax
[3:00:18] <heartlesshealer> Bolt
[3:00:19] <+Grayhammatter> that's a big spear
[3:00:20] <ape_hawk> TURTLE POPE
[3:00:20] <+678saintglock> ohhh yeahhh
[3:00:23] <@QueequegTheater> Gainax
[3:00:23] <reasonance> @SveriSageAdvice because L O R E
[3:00:24] <%zarkazeon> that is missable if you go to far in the game btw
[3:00:27] <%Valdorick> Congrats, its LIGHTNING SPEAR'S REAL UPGRADE...... and it requires 40 dex and doesn't scale off int...
[3:00:28] <jacksawjack> He's the Brilliant Goldmask not Pious
[3:00:29] <bluefootedtpeack> @SveriSageAdvice guessing it explains why goldmask got stumped, he;s a faith guy
[3:00:30] <Augus7717> Gransax deez nuts
[3:00:32] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you need to grab the tome from upstairs in the godfrey boss area first
[3:00:33] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I completely missed this weapon for the achievement, and I got fucked for it. Had to get someone on a server I'm on to drop it for me.
[3:00:33] <%TheGuesty> @Dakuu75 the statue "waves back"
[3:00:33] <+Grayhammatter> bolt of gainax PogChamp
[3:00:38] <lyzejag> GET SMARTER
[3:00:40] <morow1ec> flask bonus gives you +10 int
[3:00:42] <reasonance> the physik flask alone is +10
[3:00:44] <+NopeBadguy> i see paige has fully evolved into crab
[3:00:45] <+Kyma1020> the prayerbook can be found in the room you fought Godfrey and if you want to temporarily respec you can see the statue reveal something that you probably know
[3:00:45] <%JustToWatch> that's more than enough
[3:00:46] <%discoinfierno> same reason rats can't swim
[3:00:47] <coziestbank> Because nature decided thats the best way tomove
[3:00:47] <%RealThiele> spear has a rad art
[3:00:48] <+RedMaskBandit> u need the spell. but u can cast it if u slap on all of your int boosting gear
[3:00:50] <Sunstalker> You can get like 15 from talismans +5 from Great Rune
[3:00:56] <+Pachi3000> GOTTEM, CRABS
[3:00:57] <yyyyfdugyu> pat you need the scrumblo to activate the scrimgamblus to deavour the grimboldiosu
[3:00:58] <$vehementvadr> I've seen crabs walk forward, looks ok
[3:00:58] <%tsuchi7> @PatStaresAt use the talismans and godrick rune to get more INT for the spell
[3:01:00] <%cade_calrayn> ^
[3:01:01] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Physick is +10, Grafted Blade Greatsword gives +%
[3:01:02] <%imthewisejanitor> More than enough to kill anything that moves.
[3:01:04] <@QueequegTheater> *+5
[3:01:07] <micolash28> level 154 lmao, I'm not even 120 and I'm near the end
[3:01:10] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Just Two Fist your brain to wield the spell, duh
[3:01:11] <digaogrunge> Just spec off Endurance for a while
[3:01:11] <KyberNasse> Oh fuck I need to clear the city of stuff
[3:01:13] <reasonance> I hate that lightning stuff is now DEX for some reason
[3:01:14] <%Nobrev> I have supper high int but I had to respec twice anyway because I didn't have enough fth to use a sacred seal to cast the incantation
[3:01:15] <%tetraes> the weapon art fucks
[3:01:18] <%zarkazeon> it's art is dope
[3:01:19] <%JoshManVGH> That... is not how I though that weapon was held.
[3:01:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> I like the idea that you took a tiny little piece of that MASSIVE spear
[3:01:25] <+678saintglock> pls try the weapon art
[3:01:27] <+Rofiarf> yeah
[3:01:31] <$realm_forge> Strait out of evangelion
[3:01:33] <rReizs> raya lucaria masks give a bit of int, and there is the stargazer talisman
[3:01:33] <Dopamien> this is like those sword tooth picks you get at restaurants, but for dragons
[3:01:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> aw thx :)
[3:01:43] <+Beetlewins> Why does a lot of the Elden RIng story feel like another culture's version of the Dark Souls lore?
[3:01:44] <Augus7717> the weapon art for it fucks hard
[3:01:53] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt have to climb the root
[3:01:53] <%tsuchi7> look up
[3:01:54] <MyNameIsRasus> toma deez nuts
[3:01:57] <+Kyma1020> gotta go upstairs via tree

[3:02:17] <%SveriSageAdvice> Pat has been SCRAPING the map
[3:02:17] <@QueequegTheater> NO
[3:02:18] <RabbitOTM> Visions of tree
[3:02:19] <%Bluwizard21> unless I am blind and dumb there are like 5 time as many tomes as sorcerer scrolls
[3:02:21] <@QueequegTheater> LOOK AWAY
[3:02:22] <MyNameIsRasus> i like how many areas in this game have you parkour rooftops and shit
[3:02:23] <+Kinggarbage> Ooh i tuned in just in time
[3:02:24] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> at pat's stat, i think a full respec is the only way
[3:02:24] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> pump your dex when you pump your int during the temporary respec your gonna do so you can check it out
[3:02:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> i bet u could sprint jump that
[3:02:27] <reasonance> @heartlesshealer he's pat, of course he's scraping everything
[3:02:35] <$bcdenton> respec, cast the spell, then respec back
[3:02:36] <depressioncherrie> Goldmask ending is for INTchads only, chat

[3:02:46] <%whyskeywolfe> Hop on the branch
[3:02:49] <%JoshManVGH> Don't forget to use the gold summon for the big boss in this area
[3:02:50] <Big_Dream> just grind a few lvls
[3:02:50] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You can farm the respec item off of mobs
[3:02:56] <RubberFistFight> the trick, Pat, is to don't stop believing, hold on to that feeling.
[3:02:59] <%tsuchi7> @PatStaresAt there is a post on the wiki, even the lowest starting INT can use it with the right setup
[3:02:59] <%tetraes> @PatStaresAt  u can farm respec items
[3:02:59] <coziestbank> @patstaresat plus rune plus physick
[3:02:59] <%Agami23> theres 2 talismans that give 10 by themselves, godricks greatrune gives 5, and theres a hat that gives 6 so thats alot already
[3:03:01] <zzNamttamzz> the int tear in you physic gives +10
[3:03:02] <+messentry> you totally can i did it with nine INT too
[3:03:05] <heartlesshealer> @heartlesshealer I get scraping, just wondering if he's FULLY scraping before looking at other places
[3:03:11] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater yeah don't you get it off those mimic boulder things?
[3:03:11] <%Valdorick> He wants a Pasta Raid?
[3:03:15] <Augus7717> there is a hat that boost int by 8 and you can boost it with talismans and other stuff
[3:03:16] <@QueequegTheater> ye
[3:03:21] <blue8moon> apparently you can reach it, but only with a specific group of items LUL
[3:03:21] <FrostedZaibatsu> The Godrick rune and the Rennela hat gives you like a couple points in INT @PatStaresAt
[3:03:22] <%tetraes> The balls in Nokstella drop em
[3:03:24] <@Spydurman> Pasta Dog
[3:03:25] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> you cannot  there are only 12 per ng
[3:03:26] <@QueequegTheater> You 100% can
[3:03:27] <%Agami23> oh, and a wonderous physic can give you 10 int for 3 minutes
[3:03:27] <samuelfisk> @beetlewins Yeah, it really feels like they wanted to mix and match associations. Like lightning and dragons. Fire and gods.
[3:03:28] <%JoshManVGH> Woah
[3:03:28] <+Rofiarf> i think there is 11 per playthrough or something
[3:03:31] <@QueequegTheater> I''m pretty sure
[3:03:31] <VallerinTerra> You absolutely can farm them
[3:03:33] <+RedMaskBandit> Holy fuck, just try
[3:03:35] <$realm_forge> Poppa respec is my rapper name
[3:03:37] <ape_hawk> ZEN ARCHER
[3:03:41] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt the mimic boulders in Nokstella drop em.
[3:03:42] <Midnight188> the big metal balls in Nokstella drop them
[3:03:43] <rReizs> i got one each from the balls, but i feel like they were one time drops
[3:03:44] <%RealThiele> gotta have that arcane build
[3:03:47] <+Kinggarbage> There’s a bunch underground
[3:03:48] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> anyone who thinks you can farm them is lying
[3:03:53] <NewWillinium> Was that a body?
[3:03:53] <+Kinggarbage> Look for boulders
[3:03:53] <%Brassnarwhal> yall stop backseating holy fuck
[3:03:55] <+twdlrr> how much did the sorcery dork hats give for int?
[3:03:55] <%whyskeywolfe> It's the Non-Turtle Pope

[3:04:00] <%Monkeyweed21> Headshots for the LORD

[3:04:04] <TwistParabola> there ya go
[3:04:04] <heartlesshealer> the hanging throne
[3:04:04] <%Daskolin> Bork
[3:04:06] <+Drigoooooo> I'm pretty sure if they drop from a mob it's a one time drop
[3:04:08] <Sunstalker> @PatStaresAt Try seeing how far stacking stone crowns, all the talismans, godrick's great rune and an int boosting physick component?
[3:04:12] <%whyskeywolfe> @NewWillinium Don't worry about it.
[3:04:12] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Make sure to read lore before you give it to Dog Pope
[3:04:13] <42nfl19> DOG

[3:04:46] <%JonathLP> Turtle pople is best pope
[3:04:46] <coziestbank> scar/int tailismans, great rune, and physick could probably get you there

[3:04:49] <MyNameIsRasus> dog pope
[3:04:51] <%whyskeywolfe> Did they ever explain Miriel being a turtle? Like at all?

[3:05:10] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah, you can use the stone hats, the +5 Int Talisman, and a few other equipment pieces, plus a +10 Physick and +5 Great Rune to boost you a
[3:05:11] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater it's clearly a dog, IDFK what this "turtle" thing is that people keep talking about. "Turtle" isn't a real word.
[3:05:12] <%Agami23> theres equipment that can do that
[3:05:12] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> that's be crazy

[3:14:50] <coziestbank> So WHO'S DOG WAS IT
[3:14:51] <RabbitOTM> I am pondering
[3:14:54] <%JoshManVGH> She was married to Rannala?
[3:14:55] <%cade_calrayn> Is he a fake, though?
[3:14:55] <lyzejag> SELFT INCEST
[3:14:57] <%AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> wowieeee
[3:14:57] <PunkZedB> what if Zelda was a girl?
[3:14:58] <x2Twistedx> Did pat find the secret thing that takes you to a place at the back of the twin gargoyales fight?
[3:14:58] <T_Sasquatch> Its a Covefe?
[3:14:58] <Jace_Keats> WAIT SO RENALLA IS GAY POG
[3:14:59] <oda_flobunaga> VVoman
[3:15:01] <jubejube56> Okay but how
[3:15:02] <bluefootedtpeack> it is a good twist, also explains some things about certain demi-gods and why they are how they are.
[3:15:03] <%sporeian94> BUT HOW DID SHE FUCK HERSELF TO MAKE KIDS?
[3:15:03] <+Beetlewins> then who was elden ring?
[3:15:05] <%LeiaSkynoober> YESSS
[3:15:05] <lethallylactic> LUL
[3:15:06] <%RealThiele> PrideUnicorn
[3:15:06] <heartlesshealer> but who was phone?!
[3:15:07] <ape_hawk> i dont get what the big deal is, anyway
[3:15:07] <DestroPrime83> BUT WHO WAS PHONE?
[3:15:08] <yyyyfdugyu> radagon deez nutz
[3:15:09] <%Willowight> wait they even spoiled the reveal to you?
[3:15:09] <%dOjOTron> LUL
[3:15:09] <HeroToxiko> OSMOSIS BAYBEEEE
[3:15:12] <$vehementvadr> it wasn't 2 dudes one cup, IT WAS 2 GURLS
[3:15:13] <digaogrunge> How does that work?
[3:15:15] <%Bluwizard21> So apparently a Neuman is a asexual being that can change genders or some crazy shit
[3:15:15] <%BonewheelVanguard> @PatStaresAt I cant wait for Marika to be final boss of the DLC
[3:15:17] <FrostedZaibatsu> Is that a big spoiler?
[3:15:20] <%JoshManVGH> @sporeian94 Hey Ra did it
[3:15:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> no really, who's dog is it?
[3:15:22] <%Fenrisulfr_V> For anyone that's confused, Radagon and Marika are two aspects of the same god, and they're kids have all been produced asexually.
[3:15:23] <%whyskeywolfe> Dean-dong!
[3:15:26] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> it's like a god thing to split into separate entities
[3:15:27] <Augus7717> so Marika had a fat schlong?
[3:15:28] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @sporeian94 Looking at how the kids turned out, very badly
[3:15:30] <iteruq> @PatStaresAt Radagon still had bio children with moon queen tho
[3:15:30] <%cade_calrayn> @Bluwizard21 nope. you'll see
[3:15:32] <it_came_from_outer_space> Marika parthenogenesis
[3:15:33] <+tizziks> I am so lost as to what that even means
[3:15:34] <@QueequegTheater> @FrostedZaibatsu It's basically the only thing that can be spoiled in this game
[3:15:35] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt by the way this also means Marika LITERALLY fucked herself to produce the twins
[3:15:35] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt haha cool...but I am to dumb can you explain?
[3:15:36] <XxMoliciousxX> romulan ambassador: IT'S A FFFAAAKKE
[3:15:42] <oda_flobunaga> Futa Marika
[3:15:45] <%NBUsagi> @Fenrisulfr_V i did not know this 0w 0
[3:15:46] <jacksawjack> So Cartman's mom was also his dad then?
[3:15:47] <coziestbank> I can't believe the BIG RED DOG was a lie.
[3:15:49] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Marika split radagon from herself to go out and fuck basically
[3:15:50] <+Beetlewins> gods are weird
[3:15:51] <%cade_calrayn> Y'all, you will understand eventually
[3:15:58] <HeroToxiko> Thats what we call osmosis
[3:16:00] <bluefootedtpeack> @Fenrisulfr_V only melania and miquella were made by the two, the rest were made with godfrey and renala,
[3:16:01] <%greasypete00> I put the stagger one on
[3:16:01] <DestroPrime83> Marika had the new Futa bike?
[3:16:01] <+Beetlewins> i mean Zeus used to turn into a swan to get his bone on
[3:16:04] <it_came_from_outer_space> just equip the prettiest marbles @PatStaresAt
[3:16:04] <KyberNasse> Is this a My Own Clone moment
[3:16:04] <Ghufufin> infinite fp?
[3:16:04] <%RealThiele> Radagan choke jerked into the ocean to make kids
[3:16:05] <%Brassnarwhal> @rosabellamelantha god damnit George
[3:16:05] <+678saintglock> marika knotted herself
[3:16:06] <reasonance> I like extra posture damage
[3:16:06] <%JoshManVGH> Unlimited mana rot breath would be funny
[3:16:07] <%TG_Cid11> @PatStaresAt Tell Paige to post the recipe on twitter
[3:16:07] <+badhaye> I put shield and regen
[3:16:10] <+hoenhime344> why is this game so fking good.... HOW did they get it down to 45gig!?!??!?!?
[3:16:11] <%Nobrev> I use int boost and infinite fp for 10 seconds
[3:16:15] <FrostedZaibatsu> @FrostedZaibatsu I mean i still dont know WHAT its spoiling honestly
[3:16:16] <%Pookiedaexzile> Radragon is A goddess's Strapon
[3:16:20] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> did chat spoil pat or was it from something else?
[3:16:20] <andrewoid_> i just be using double crimson crystal ear, free divine blessing every bonfire :)
[3:16:21] <HeroToxiko> that means godrick just wanted to be back in his moms arms, LITERALLY
[3:16:22] <zzNamttamzz> So the twins are full Gods not demi gods?
[3:16:24] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Enhance charge attacks + Shield does work
[3:16:29] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt the reason the twins are cursed is because they are born from superincest of a god fucking themselves
[3:16:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> head progward
[3:16:33] <$Emperor_Machinus> Is Lasagna a code word?
[3:16:46] <+SilverDevilfish> SUPER INCEST
[3:16:46] <Glockroach2774> Candins dont make zagna
[3:16:49] <+The_EL_Destino> I wonder how big Pope Turtle dick is
[3:16:51] <samuelfisk> @zznamttamzz exactly
[3:16:53] <$vehementvadr> what kids
[3:16:54] <+Beetlewins> yeah it is code for pizza
[3:16:55] <NewWillinium> Is it Incest Babies?
[3:16:55] <%Brassnarwhal> @hoenhime344 the real question is how triple a games are so poorly optimized that every update for call of duty is a hundred gigabytes
[3:16:59] <lyzejag> INCEEEST
[3:17:00] <MyNameIsRasus> Imma be honest, i'll just wait for the vaati video. i don't get it
[3:17:01] <oda_flobunaga> Inbreeding FTW LUL
[3:17:02] <HeroToxiko> Actually cursed
[3:17:02] <%NBUsagi> Supercest?
[3:17:02] <%Willowight> its called selfcest
[3:17:03] <%Valdorick> Maraika X Radagon fanfiction: Tags; Selfcest
[3:17:06] <+eanscrale> selfcest huh
[3:17:06] <rosabellamelantha> @vehementvadr Miquella and Malenia
[3:17:08] <HeroToxiko> @NewWillinium yes
[3:17:09] <%JoshManVGH> Does it!?
[3:17:10] <42nfl19> How can it be incest? Isnt it jsut mastrubation?
[3:17:11] <+RogueCrocodile> Also other reasons
[3:17:12] <+leyk36> Marika split herself into a male form. Maybe so that she could be her own Elden Lord and not have to share power with Godfrey?
[3:17:12] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[3:17:12] <lethallylactic> You can tell GRRM wrote this backstory because of all the incest.
[3:17:13] <Ghufufin> self love finds a way
[3:17:13] <%RealThiele> Wincest
[3:17:15] <%Valdorick> Also means Renalla got Catfished
[3:17:17] <MyNameIsRasus> OF COURSE IT'S INCEST, IT'S GRRM
[3:17:17] <+hoenhime344> @Brassnarwhal amen
[3:17:19] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> What hurts more Incest or scarlet rot?
[3:17:19] <depressioncherrie> I'm shocked that a game written by GRR Martin would contain incest
[3:17:19] <%Brassnarwhal> @newwillinium seems to be selfcest babies
[3:17:20] <+wizard_of_diamonds> ....ooooh
[3:17:20] <bluefootedtpeack> also means radahn isn't inbred, or a double god, he's just a unit who loves his horse.
[3:17:20] <ohno58> More like selfcest?
[3:17:21] <oda_flobunaga> Rot's just Super Lupus though
[3:17:22] <%abakkus> incest? in a GRRM work? who could have seen this coming
[3:17:22] <superzebra101> incest causes you to slowly die who would have thunk
[3:17:23] <RubberFistFight> Almost heaven, west virginia... Kappa
[3:17:23] <$Teh_Un> It's always incest
[3:17:24] <XxMoliciousxX> literal go fuck yo self?
[3:17:24] <+beansoup> when will they introduce an incest status effect
[3:17:24] <@QueequegTheater> @hoenhime344 Japan actually knows how to compress files
[3:17:25] <heartlesshealer> The Deep South
[3:17:26] <KyberNasse> Shouldve guessed
[3:17:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Wincest Strikes Again
[3:17:28] <ape_hawk> not just incest, but GOD INCEST
[3:17:28] <PunkZedB> don't sleep with your other self without protection or you'll get the rot
[3:17:29] <iteruq> @PatStaresAt  and miqella is forever kid
[3:17:29] <+Kyma1020> Is selfcest incest?
[3:17:29] <DestroPrime83> Why does it always come down to incest?
[3:17:30] <CackleDen> GRRM was involved, of course there is incest
[3:17:33] <$sarah_galb> george RR martin writing incest colour me shocked
[3:17:33] <eleskei> yoga man
[3:17:33] <%Criotos> was just beating renalla first try, but one of her summon attacks went off after my final hit as she was still talking and killed me, so it didn't count :(
[3:17:34] <oda_flobunaga> Communicable Lupus

[3:17:45] <HeroToxiko> More Like CHAD DAN
[3:17:46] <samuelfisk> This also explains how Radagon and Rennala’s kids are supposed to be demigods
[3:17:46] <Augus7717> T
[3:17:46] <%epide> LOL PAT T POSE
[3:17:46] <lyzejag> T

[3:17:56] <%AnthroMetal> best emote in the game
[3:17:56] <17sevens> most important emote got
[3:17:59] <%deadguydied> @patstaresat don't forget to swap rings back
[3:17:59] <%cade_calrayn> ah, right, Miquella and Malenia are the only ones that are direct children of Radagon and Marika
[3:18:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> bro fuck off, cogitation
[3:18:03] <blue8moon> I mean mythology involves gods screwing their own relatives all the time, it's not that surprising honestly LUL
[3:18:05] <%Pookiedaexzile> GRRM has 2 Tricks, Stabbings and Incest
[3:18:07] <%Puhff> Rot is older than Tree
[3:18:11] <%act8lyrist> incest. that good GRRM touch
[3:18:15] <+lord_sykos> T-pose!
[3:18:15] <bassoontyphoon> An incest plotpoint?? I guess we know what George RR contributed to the writing
[3:18:17] <%greasypete00> Woah
[3:18:18] <KyberNasse> Oh shit L-posing Dagoth Ur
[3:18:20] <42nfl19> I dont understand
[3:18:23] <+RedMaskBandit> it's going to be such a mindfuck when Woolie gets to this part and pat has to remember this
[3:18:24] <%luftraumm1> wait, so radagon never was?
[3:18:24] <%crimsonharvest> so is the golden order just a divine decree to keep life and death in separate realms or what
[3:18:28] <reasonance> that's why renalla's kids turned out so much better LUL
[3:18:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> Radagon was Marikas strapon come to life
[3:18:43] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Do T-Pose
[3:18:45] <%RealThiele> lil HRT and good to go god
[3:18:46] <AMiserablePileOfShiitake> 'Better'
[3:18:48] <@QueequegTheater> @reasonance I mean, Radahn is way less of a cunt than Mohg or Malenia
[3:18:49] <+Beetlewins> you should hit that guy with your sword
[3:18:52] <rosabellamelantha> @luftraumm1 Marika and Radagon have always been 2 personalities in one person
[3:18:52] <PunkZedB> how does he scribe with that blindfold on?
[3:18:53] <HeroToxiko> @42nfl19 IT'S ALL INCEST
[3:19:01] <heartlesshealer> not twitch dying while pat is finally listening to lore
[3:19:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> i'm impressed he figured that out from the cogitation
[3:19:01] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I think that's how the quest gets continued.
[3:19:05] <%Valdorick> So... does that mean Ranni got more of Radagon's genes than Renallas?
[3:19:06] <lethallylactic> T
[3:19:06] <%baka_sugoi> T
[3:19:07] <jbrachob> POSE WITH GOLDMASK
[3:19:12] <%JoshManVGH> Love it
[3:19:12] <eleskei> YEA
[3:19:13] <+tizziks> T pose with authority!
[3:19:13] <+Cecrios> The dude isn't even a scribe, he's more like an intern
[3:19:13] <+serialkira9> assert dominance
[3:19:14] <42nfl19> DOMINANCE
[3:19:14] <Gray_LoFi> Oh god PVP is going to be so toxic with that T-pose
[3:19:14] <Jontman42> that's fucking dominant
[3:19:15] <superzebra101> fucking tpose in a souls like game im done lol
[3:19:16] <HeroToxiko> @PunkZedB braille
[3:19:17] <@QueequegTheater> AUTHORITY
[3:19:19] <TwistParabola> T
[3:19:19] <Ner234> T
[3:19:19] <tanarath> ASSERT DOMINANCE
[3:19:23] <mrtanaka111> THE EVER BRILLIANT
[3:19:26] <XxMoliciousxX> look if you can control over matter/energy, changing sexes is like changing socks
[3:19:26] <Glockroach2774> cooch messing up the world smh
[3:19:27] <zhenthrim213> is that why the twins fucked up everyone eles as well because there pure clones of marika
[3:19:28] <%luftraumm1> @luftraumm1 but he/she managed to have children with him/herself?
[3:19:29] <moneymoves2030> Incestuous Heat sounds like a metal band
[3:19:30] <+nicoleymcquack> that man hard dabbing in the back
[3:19:31] <FrostedZaibatsu> No that the default T pose
[3:19:31] <+5Two> Of course, it's for asserting dominance.
[3:19:35] <%cade_calrayn> @QueequegTheater also, Radahn at this point in time is just a shell, the Rot ate him from the inside long ago
[3:19:35] <%Saadi90> It’s like that Cyberpunk game
[3:19:35] <+Kavtech> Wait, so other than Miquella and Malenia who else was the child of Radagonika?
[3:19:35] <%baka_sugoi> AUTHORATY
[3:19:42] <%NBUsagi> So we are dealing with 3 sets of kids. Godfrey's Kids, Renalla and Radagons kids, and incest kids of Radagon/Marika?
[3:19:44] <+badhaye> It's the pose he does when you cast the ring of light spell
[3:19:45] <ape_hawk> @luftraumm1 she split herself, biologically
[3:19:46] <samuelfisk> That is Kamen Rider levels of aggression
[3:19:46] <bluefootedtpeack> it ties into how half the cast have dual identites,  like ranni is playing at being renna,  marika is radagon,  d is literally two people,  and then there are a few more that're probably spoilers.
[3:19:59] <42nfl19> I hope that becomes the new PVP pose for styling on fools
[3:20:01] <%Brassnarwhal> @moneymoves2030 maybe one from the deep south lol
[3:20:01] <rosabellamelantha> @luftraumm1 yes she split her male personality off into his own person
[3:20:04] <Jace_Keats> man I need that Vaati video right now I'm so confused LUL
[3:20:05] <%luftraumm1> so its basically mitosis?
[3:20:12] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah
[3:20:13] <+InhumanMilitia> how do you have so many archs???
[3:20:17] <coziestbank> No wonder the M brothers look so weird

[3:20:36] <mrtanaka111> is this the power of geometry?

[3:20:38] <Ghufufin> meeting of the minds
[3:20:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> you gotta hold it for 3 hours
[3:20:40] <jbrachob> ASSERT AUTHORITY
[3:20:41] <%Buzzard42> T Pose for dominance
[3:20:42] <@QueequegTheater> He's unflappable!
[3:20:42] <+Jeshk0> your t-pose means NOTHING
[3:20:47] <Omenaire_> he is unfazed
[3:20:47] <+Beetlewins> be so funny if he punted you off the cliff
[3:20:48] <KyberNasse> [MENACING]
[3:20:48] <rosabellamelantha> @coziestbank The M brothers are NOT products of incest as they are of godfrey's line
[3:20:50] <jorniev> GUTS
[3:20:54] <%JustToWatch> it would rule if Goldmask just had a boss health bar appear
[3:20:55] <coziestbank> Intelligence Arc OVER
[3:20:57] <DestroPrime83> FIGHT FOR SUPREMACY!
[3:20:58] <%Brassnarwhal> Man Brandon Sanderson would have explained how all this shit works way more clearly and there would have been a side book that details the exact functional details of the magic and shit
[3:20:58] <jubejube56> He taught that to you
[3:20:59] <%baka_sugoi> T POSE HARDER

[3:34:47] <%Brassnarwhal> The thought of walking into a zone in dark souls and the zone does the title drop and it just says Revachol almost killed me
[3:34:48] <%epide> you have to back trace and open the door

[3:35:53] <%crimsonharvest> you know how some people can't see the path up to the aqueduct in DS1 at first? the next step of eastward progress was like that for me
[3:35:57] <ape_hawk> so he was a simp?
[3:35:58] <T_Sasquatch> @queequegtheater oh i didn't realise it was an actual prerequiste
[3:36:03] <mrtanaka111> he was too good for this world
[3:36:04] <%JoshManVGH> Nope
[3:36:05] <+InhumanMilitia> nope
[3:36:05] <ape_hawk> hey guys, morgott's a simp!
[3:36:06] <TwistParabola> wrong tower
[3:36:07] <@QueequegTheater> East Altus
[3:36:08] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt not that one either
[3:36:10] <%cade_calrayn> Nah, that one is for a different shardbearer
[3:36:10] <lethallylactic> Imagine simping for a tree

[3:36:21] <%cade_calrayn> You'll get to it by going to the Mountains
[3:36:21] <+leyk36> That’s not his
[3:36:25] <oda_flobunaga> You haven't found it yet
[3:36:26] <$sarah_galb> on the way out
[3:36:27] <+Kyma1020> the one you were it is Rykard's
[3:36:28] <TwistParabola> you remember the gate that was like 'locked by the grace of Morgott?'
[3:36:30] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt On the east end of the capitol there was a big door blocked by the grace of morgott
[3:36:32] <@QueequegTheater> @Brassnarwhal Yes, but only against pale characters
[3:36:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Head towards Grand Lift to find tower
[3:36:35] <@Spydurman> so is the idea the last Elden Lord broke the Elden Ring and the Erdtree is locking them out preventing anyone from fixing it? Or am I way off
[3:36:38] <%Mantorok06> It's right down the road

[3:37:17] <+eanscrale> maybe you need some other fingers, like more than two maybe...
[3:37:23] <@QueequegTheater> @Brassnarwhal Measurehead but he's Spanish
[3:37:24] <@Spydurman> @Spydurman ok, I've only half paid attention so not surprising lol

[3:37:36] <%cade_calrayn> @Spydurman the fingers blame Marika, and Marika is locked inside the Erdtree, the brambles are the erdtree's defense mechanism?
[3:37:38] <KyberNasse> "Yo granny, I wanna burn the yggrdrasil, you cool?"

[3:48:43] <heartlesshealer> Omens
[3:48:43] <+badhaye> Omens like Mhorg and Margot
[3:48:44] <FrostedZaibatsu> Omens - Oni
[3:48:44] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Omens are cursed people that grow horns all over.
[3:48:44] <TwistParabola> Omens are born with horns all over
[3:48:44] <%curiour> Omen Royalty don't get their horns removed
[3:48:44] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt All Omens are horny

[3:49:27] <genmypoweralready> Vaati told me in a secret DM the horns represent capitalism
[3:49:28] <%luftraumm1> where do you find the raging wolf set?
[3:49:28] <42nfl19> What is thedescription of the new summon pat?
[3:49:32] <athuramn> omens are symbols of defilement, and having a horn on you would mean no leyndell for you
[3:49:37] <%radiorosewater> idn't morgoyle the scrimblo marghinal margit runes on the ring?
[3:49:38] <jacksawjack> so they threw the horny babies in the sewer
[3:49:40] <yyyyfdugyu> not just the omen but the owomen and the ochildren too

[3:49:43] <heartlesshealer> many birds were harmed in the making of this character
[3:49:44] <andrewoid_> pat you're 5 levels higher than when i beat the game
[3:49:47] <bluefootedtpeack> members of godfery's lineage who have the curse, think it might be the seabed curse the dungeater is fond of as he is covered in the bumps too.
[3:49:48] <+leyk36> @patstaresat you’re the same level I was when I beat the game, lol
[3:49:55] <+RocketBarrel> Kinda dank out here
[3:49:58] <NFTbad> @heartlesshealer good
[3:50:05] <TwistParabola> GRRM told me the horns are a metaphor for being born disabled and shunned
[3:50:12] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Has Pat fought Radahn?
[3:50:14] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Note, Morgott's is to the side instead of centered.
[3:50:15] <+Grayhammatter> gee i wonder
[3:50:17] <Khester824> it's for when you beat Mogh
[3:50:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> isn't there graces on the other towers?
[3:50:29] <reasonance> @AHomeschoolDropout bruh like 30 hours ago
[3:50:53] <+badhaye> Lends credence to my bastard children take
[3:50:58] <+InhumanMilitia> they are cursed royalty born that way and kept hidden away( i wont say where spoilers) cursed common children were executed
[3:51:03] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> all stats, pump the bars a little, or pump health a lot

[3:51:14] <%epide> use rodans its the fap - equip load
[3:51:16] <+extantCadence> I'm going to guess that these graces may have been placed before fast travel from the map was decided on
[3:51:22] <%abakkus> oh she
[3:51:23] <zzNamttamzz> Spiked fist KomodoHype
[3:51:24] <yyyyfdugyu> morgott seems to be the only demigod who had his shit together

[3:51:37] <%NopeBadguy> pat LOVES sin
[3:51:40] <ALazo> cardinal sins are cool
[3:51:43] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Is she going to sacrifice herself?
[3:51:46] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt read new summon? Was it a summon?
[3:51:47] <samuelfisk> Godrick and Morgott’s runes look like they form the core
[3:51:49] <%abakkus> i keep hitting enter instead of apostrophe lord help me
[3:51:51] <%pinkslimegoblin> I wish you got more dialogue with her throughout the game
[3:51:54] <ape_hawk> im sinning right now!
[3:52:06] <deviljhojho_> seems like an oleg upgrade
[3:52:07] <%luftraumm1> the summon you just got?
[3:52:09] <+silver__viii> if there's one thing i know about Pat it's that he loves to commit cardinal sins
[3:52:12] <%Valdorick> Pat gonna make some guy a Scholar... a Scholar of the First Sin.
[3:52:15] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt Hey, did you find the Mimic Ash of War?
[3:52:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> named after a tasty caramel filled chocolate tho
[3:52:20] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt The NPC is not for a while
[3:52:24] <%cade_calrayn> nah, that's *after* the Great Lift
[3:52:25] <TwistParabola> ?
[3:52:25] <Ethel9727> The  NPC is hard to miss, first grace after the lift
[3:52:26] <DestroPrime83> When do we start the Orgies? We need to start this sin party off right
[3:52:29] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt so there's an optional area I really think you should check out, but I'm not sure how to point you there without a. spoiling or b. backseating, and i don't wanna do either.
[3:52:31] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt yeah there's an npc who says some fun stuff once you get past the lift
[3:52:31] <NewWillinium> *Cheers*  Man playing alongside you must be good luck Pat, I just beat yet another boss. I've been told that there's only one more, so I need you to keep bringing that luck
[3:52:37] <Ethel9727> Do the npc first
[3:52:40] <jubejube56> So omen killers kill the morgotts and margitts?
[3:52:41] <@QueequegTheater> Mimic-Chan is besto waifu
[3:52:44] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt just do the Goddamn Basement
[3:52:46] <+leyk36> No, look for the NPC after the great elevator
[3:52:51] <rosabellamelantha> NPC first is better
[3:52:52] <%JoshManVGH> Oh that npc
[3:52:54] <@QueequegTheater> Do what you want
[3:52:55] <NewWillinium> You absolutely can. I don't think there's anything stopping you to doing the Basement
[3:52:55] <jubejube56> But omenkillers seem to hunt albanaurics too
[3:52:56] <SarahPainAndToil> I mean what's the alternative? Just turn the game off?

[4:01:06] <zzNamttamzz> Using his own weapon on him NotLikeThis
[4:01:07] <ExpressNode> And people say he's overleveled. That boss is tanky
[4:01:07] <%JoshManVGH> Pat, you seem under leceled
[4:01:12] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @TrollKing96 Snow.
[4:01:13] <%JoshManVGH> leveled fuck
[4:01:16] <@QueequegTheater> Miyazaki saw people overlevelling in the other games and got offended
[4:01:19] <+aaymon86> Even at Pat's level this boss can still 3 tap you
[4:01:22] <deviljhojho_> These black blade freaks are real strong
[4:01:26] <jubejube56> I would suggest leveling up and coming back
[4:01:27] <%cade_calrayn> let's go girls
[4:01:34] <it_came_from_outer_space> @QueequegTheater based
[4:01:36] <domukujira> can u get millicents wep and gear?

[4:01:48] <deviljhojho_> holy shit
[4:01:49] <+Pachi3000> let
[4:01:50] <spinningchurro> I wonder what players who aren’t overleveled do here?
[4:01:54] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @domukujira Yeah. The sword she's currently using is in Limgrage.

[4:02:22] <domukujira> oh neat
[4:02:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> just chuck rocks
[4:02:30] <+superchronicc> did that thing heal itself
[4:02:32] <akitanito> your spirit just doing chip damage
[4:02:35] <Augus7717> WHY CAN IT HEAL?!
[4:02:41] <@QueequegTheater> Kappa
[4:03:02] <heartlesshealer> cool to see one of these statue dudes moving
[4:03:04] <rosabellamelantha> Reminder that fextralife tries to peddle some bullshit that this is a level 80 area
[4:03:11] <Saturation_Lizard> @Augus7717 its actually not healing, tiche's moves temporarily reduce max HP but it comes back after a while
[4:03:11] <@QueequegTheater> This boy ain't nothing compared to what's ahead
[4:03:22] <RyuuAoi> Aye!

[4:03:53] <zzNamttamzz> Last one standing
[4:04:00] <Baeltyr> was that a different npc death msg
[4:04:07] <%Agami23> i have no idea why it was healing, that was weird
[4:04:10] <heartlesshealer> does it matter that it said Millicent has died?
[4:04:20] <Baeltyr> ^?
[4:04:27] <%Fenrisulfr_V> No.
[4:04:31] <%luftraumm1> ^?

[4:15:07] <deviljhojho_> this area is pure horror
[4:15:08] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> ITS NOT
[4:15:14] <TwistParabola> a bit!
[4:15:16] <Augus7717> for now it is
[4:15:16] <%MaybeFalco> kinda
[4:15:16] <+tizziks> Ranni is cool, but I think MIlly is my gal.
[4:15:18] <%JoshManVGH> Cause it's a funnel?
[4:15:19] <$Jaxnos> it would seem that way.

[4:15:20] <Ersov> its not far
[4:15:20] <@QueequegTheater> IT GOT BIGGER AGAIN
[4:15:20] <Angry_Ev1L> nice theory... lol
[4:15:23] <%cade_calrayn> there's a reason why the map is split like that

[4:15:26] <lethallylactic> It definitely isn't LUL
[4:15:26] <$Jaxnos> seem being the operative word.
[4:15:28] <%MaybeFalco> very carefully, that's how
[4:15:29] <%Agami23> its actually kinda straight forward
[4:15:31] <+thickshield> its still pretty big, but its a lot less then the others for sure
[4:15:32] <TwistParabola> keep talking to millicent?
[4:15:34] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Hang a left when you can

[4:21:25] <+extantCadence> I accidentally killed Patches in my game
[4:21:27] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater yeah it took me a while too
[4:21:28] <TrashManRising> friend!
[4:21:38] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> how do you get patches to appear at the manor? i've done 2 hunts and he's still not there

[4:21:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> god what an asshole
[4:21:52] <pi_in_the_sci> I think he did
[4:21:53] <NewWillinium> Huh. That's odd. I was able to demand a reward from him
[4:21:57] <%StewTheGreat> you go sit down and talk to him again to get the whip
[4:21:57] <Augus7717> why is patches even here?

[4:22:12] <Namillus> Talisman
[4:22:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> talisman?

[4:22:17] <Augus7717> talisman
[4:22:18] <TwistParabola> talisman
[4:22:20] <Estwilde> talisman looks like
[4:22:22] <@QueequegTheater> Undertaker PogChamp
[4:22:24] <+badhaye> talisman
[4:22:29] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> the items show what they are in the top left of the box
[4:22:29] <TwistParabola> rest and talk to patches first
[4:22:31] <%Valdorick> you can look at the icon in the corner of that pop up to see what it is.
[4:22:33] <KyberNasse> I killed Rykard too early and I missed the Cameo :( Gotta get it on ng+
[4:22:33] <42nfl19> THIS PLACE IS TOTALLY NOT EVIL
[4:22:37] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt before you agree to this - how far into Rya's questline have you gone? I'm assuming you found the hidden area here?
[4:22:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @cade_calrayn That and Rykards sword fucks
[4:22:48] <+extantCadence> HP on kill talisman. It's 60 HP per kill apparently.
[4:22:59] <zecht89> you haven't killed Rykard yet?
[4:22:59] <%Agami23> wanna know where to find her?
[4:23:04] <+InhumanMilitia> also pat when you get items the top left shows the category its in
[4:23:08] <%whyskeywolfe> She's in a special room.
[4:23:11] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt alright. There's a jump off the lift that's behind the cathedral that leads to a hidden attic where she is now.
[4:23:13] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt go find Rya first
[4:23:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Her quest is VERY finicky
[4:23:20] <mrtanaka111> buttface
[4:23:22] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> you needed to talk to Tanith before finishing the manor quest to beat it properly
[4:23:24] <%Zeroblazex> I never realized this was the war master till the very end
[4:23:29] <+678saintglock> this is another great song
[4:23:35] <%Agami23> in the temple of eigley grace of volcano manor, you go to the elevator shortcut and jump through a door on the elevator
[4:23:38] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Fun guy
[4:23:52] <RubberFistFight> @JustTheGuyYouNeed the quest is doing fine
[4:23:52] <Estwilde> these folks are interesting
[4:23:52] <TwistParabola> talk to patches
[4:24:01] <zzNamttamzz> There's a ladder, no jump needed
[4:24:03] <+Pachi3000> He was holding out on you!
[4:24:08] <lethallylactic> LUL Patches
[4:24:08] <samuelfisk> I love the Volcanp
[4:24:10] <oda_flobunaga> Good
[4:24:12] <@QueequegTheater> LUL
[4:24:13] <+RocketBarrel> Bitch was hiding it
[4:24:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This manor looks like a very Evil Residence.....
[4:24:15] <%crimsonharvest> yeah im glad i murked him asap
[4:24:15] <%Zeroblazex> You can still finish the quest
[4:24:16] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt speficially the cathedral you beat up the fatty in. the one that's a little like the one you fight Pontiff in DS3.
[4:24:17] <Sunstalker> He's such an arse
[4:24:22] <kingra> That sounds dumb asf
[4:24:28] <%Agami23> thats a faith whip
[4:24:29] <samuelfisk> *Volcano Manor people
[4:24:32] <rosabellamelantha> Left
[4:24:35] <KyberNasse> I didnt realize it was the Warmaster until I heard "WELL"
[4:24:36] <%whyskeywolfe> Hit the elevator
[4:24:37] <%Fenrisulfr_V> The Candle whip is really fucking stupid looking.
[4:24:39] <oda_flobunaga> Magmen
[4:24:44] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt over to the left of where you spawn in there's a door between two torches.
[4:24:46] <NewWillinium> So I had a NPC show up after this. But I don't know if he only shows up after you beat the boss, or if he might be there now that you've reloaded the Manor area.
[4:24:47] <%baka_sugoi> WHIP THE SIN AWAY

[4:25:41] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @RubberFistFight He can still do it, but if you talk to Tanith she also gives you another way to finish the quest

[4:26:18] <%Valdorick> He has a GREAT boss weapon
[4:26:30] <@QueequegTheater> Tanith also teleports you into the grace beforehand

[4:26:38] <zecht89> do you like berserk, the boss
[4:26:44] <%Agami23> over into the other window
[4:26:47] <%Nekros4442> rykard's boss weapon carried me through the game

[4:27:11] <Estwilde> @TurtlesAndTentacles invasion->murder
[4:27:12] <@QueequegTheater> FeelsBadMan
[4:27:13] <oda_flobunaga> Rykard's fight is probably the best version of that type of fight that From has ever done
[4:27:14] <dinnydanny777> Spooky
[4:27:15] <eleskei> wow saranoc ritual room much
[4:27:15] <+Pachi3000> "Cool, I love sin"

[4:27:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Go talk to Tanith
[4:27:53] <RubberFistFight> @rosabellamelantha damnit i was trying to avoid steering him too hard on that LUL
[4:27:53] <%mythcreant> kill the dad

[4:27:55] <%mythcreant> KILL THE DAD

[4:28:01] <PeachJays> what a jerk that guy is
[4:28:03] <akitanito> "fuck you dad!"
[4:28:04] <dinnydanny777> Does she react if you gesture at her? LUL
[4:28:04] <KyberNasse> T Pose at her
[4:28:08] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight nope. Kill her, potion her, or do nothing and come back after killing rykard
[4:28:09] <%TheAdMerlin> I wonder if she would respond to the "you're beautiful" sound too
[4:28:12] <%Zeroblazex> Tanith doesn’t give that option anymore if you’re this late in
[4:28:13] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @zzNamttamzz You still get it from the good ending, tho
[4:28:15] <%twistedj3ster> oh geez
[4:28:19] <mike2hands> lytUSEGUN
[4:28:20] <NewWillinium> Hey Pat is there a new NPC in the Dining Room here? If not there may bo one after the Praeter's fight
[4:28:27] <%JoshManVGH> "Kill me" "Kill you DAD, you say!? Right then!"
[4:28:31] <rosabellamelantha> The other two options suck though
[4:28:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> uhho
[4:28:38] <oda_flobunaga> Not YET
[4:28:48] <+godzookylives> ONE GUY
[4:28:49] <%RealThiele> i found this storm ruler fight to be the hardest one
[4:28:51] <%captain_thickthighs> she was born of the broken Elden condom
[4:28:53] <%crot454> where patches?
[4:28:55] <NewWillinium> Nope not yet then. Man I missed so many of the NPC storylines
[4:29:00] <ohno58> I don't like the way the npc quests are handled. Way too easy to miss things.
[4:29:01] <%Agami23> ah, normally you would get another piece of dialogue with tannith but you did the volcano manor quest too soon. no key item for you
[4:29:06] <42nfl19> FAREWELL?
[4:29:06] <RubberFistFight> @crot454 he's still in the lobby
[4:29:23] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt it's just a mindwiping potion, don't worry. You don't need it.
[4:29:24] <T_Sasquatch> @ohno58 welcome to fromsoft
[4:29:25] <NewWillinium> Now I don't know if I LOVE or Hate this boss
[4:29:26] <%Zeroblazex> This is the best of the gimmick bosses, I hope you enjoy!
[4:29:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> this fight is cool
[4:29:28] <GrenYena> Damn i did not take THIS path here
[4:29:29] <%Agami23> you did the last volcano manor quest too soon. its not important
[4:29:34] <jubejube56> Funny to think you could skip that entire dungeon
[4:29:45] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt try R1 now
[4:29:48] <%Agami23> summon mimic for fun
[4:29:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Bring Mimic Tear
[4:29:50] <eleskei> wow
[4:29:51] <GrenYena> I actually found the boss room by myself and wasnt transported here
[4:29:55] <artoflec> Sean Delabra
[4:29:55] <%captain_thickthighs> ohhh big berserk vibes
[4:29:56] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @jubejube56 ...That's what I did until Pat did it.
[4:29:56] <%Valdorick> They made it OPPULANT
[4:29:57] <42nfl19> thats the dad?

[4:30:11] <%Zeroblazex> You can also L2,L2
[4:30:12] <Augus7717> thats just cool
[4:30:12] <eleskei> deamon lava room
[4:30:13] <Saturation_Lizard> try a jumping heavy
[4:30:16] <Ner234> Yoooooooo
[4:30:16] <%Valdorick> So uh... this is the Stormruler fight... *its a real fight*
[4:30:17] <%baka_sugoi> POKE
[4:30:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> REMEMBER YHORM
[4:30:20] <genmypoweralready> get ate
[4:30:22] <2deep5u> om nom nom
[4:30:23] <@QueequegTheater> Kappa
[4:30:24] <T_Sasquatch> Ofcourse its just a serpent
[4:30:26] <%Agami23> the weapon art and its followup are great
[4:30:26] <mike2hands> the fuck is this , it looks dope
[4:30:26] <artoflec> lol im surprised that 2nd slam didnt do any damage
[4:30:30] <%TheAdMerlin> Pat, your Mimic can ALSO use the weapon art
[4:30:30] <%NopeBadguy> i actually really didn't like this fight
[4:30:31] <%AHomeschoolDropout> The L2 alwayus stuns btw
[4:30:31] <%MaybeFalco> yo pat, double serpent hunter
[4:30:32] <%RealThiele> yea this fight is real
[4:30:32] <RubberFistFight> Yes Pat. it's just the serpent. And nothing more. Kappa
[4:30:32] <%TheGuesty> oh that is killer
[4:30:33] <kingra> 🐍 Gonna eatcha
[4:30:34] <%NopeBadguy> it felt like a cakewalk
[4:30:34] <NewWillinium> This is what the Stormruler Fight SHOULD have been
[4:30:35] <ohno58> @T_Sasquatch I know they've always done it like this, it just really bothered me this time around because there were way more npc stories in this game.
[4:30:35] <TwistParabola> say it with me, guys! VORE
[4:30:36] <%Nobrev> if you summon mimic pat they use the spear too
[4:30:39] <+TheBitingIrish> TOGGLE, PAT! doodTerror
[4:30:43] <+imkino_> @artoflec mashing does that
[4:30:44] <genmypoweralready> Yeah it ian't the manta rays
[4:30:47] <+MihriChan> This seems like Yhorm but dont properly
[4:30:48] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Upgrading the spear actually makes it do more damage if you care
[4:30:52] <it_came_from_outer_space> ds1 hydra vibes
[4:30:54] <+raindog23> its like yhorm but good
[4:30:54] <+seaearthandsky> oh yeah this ain't no storm king
[4:30:55] <+silent__chief> Use the win button (mimic tear)
[4:30:56] <+Nero_Cross> If you upgrade the spear the fight becomes a joke because the gimmick damage scales with the actual damage LUL
[4:30:57] <jubejube56> I thought you already did this fight then died on purpose
[4:30:59] <TheBlankAce> Yeah they made the gimmick fight real this time
[4:31:01] <HeroToxiko> gun
[4:31:03] <%Valdorick> This aint fucking Yhorm, that's for sure
[4:31:03] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt Think of the L2 like using Interrupt on a trial in FF14
[4:31:06] <%captain_thickthighs> so susanoo fight
[4:31:07] <+badhaye> it's a charge weapon dude
[4:31:12] <+InhumanMilitia> Skill um
[4:31:19] <%Zeroblazex> L2 is a interrupt
[4:31:19] <%minimumeffortmaximumderp> This snake looks like it would be so hard to beat with just melee
[4:31:19] <akitanito> I'm surprise the lava isn't doing that much damage
[4:31:21] <CheeseBurgerHelper> What weapon is he using?
[4:31:22] <%RealThiele> L2 cant interrupt back to back he gains immunity
[4:31:25] <%Niney_Who> Yeah it's gross
[4:31:25] <%Cozy90> yeah they do
[4:31:28] <%Agami23> if you click L2 twice you get a big follow up
[4:31:28] <%Valdorick> Its not a snake, its a Serpent Kappa
[4:31:29] <sendart> It doesn't say its a snake
[4:31:30] <NewWillinium> Some Snakes actually do. It's super weird looking
[4:31:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's not a snake it's a serpent
[4:31:31] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Chat give me the courage to play this game. Pat makes it look so effortless. I feel like Imma get my ass whooped lol
[4:31:33] <genmypoweralready> SOme do
[4:31:34] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> snakes aren't that big either
[4:31:35] <+MarkoTolstov> yes they do dude, duh
[4:31:36] <+badhaye> HOLD L2 TO CHARGE IT UP BOYO
[4:31:36] <genmypoweralready> Vestigal
[4:31:37] <%cade_calrayn> how else would they swim, Pat?
[4:31:37] <artoflec> they just tuck their arms inside pat
[4:31:37] <%crimsonharvest> youre lookin at an armsnake going 'you dont exist'
[4:31:38] <Sol_Install> snakes do have limbs
[4:31:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> they super do
[4:31:39] <TheBlankAce> It ate a lot of gods to get those arms
[4:31:40] <zzNamttamzz> So you're some kind of snake expert now?
[4:31:41] <Midnight188> its a Lindwurm
[4:31:43] <%Deft_Thought> Is it destroying the arena?
[4:31:44] <ArgentUndaCova> There's some old Chinese story about a dude drawing arms on a snake iirc mopT
[4:31:45] <+FlappySeal_> What about Solid Snake?
[4:31:46] <Estwilde> this one do
[4:31:48] <%Deft_Thought> Oh, just an area around him
[4:31:49] <heartlesshealer> oh man
[4:31:50] <@QueequegTheater> @TurtlesAndTentacles It's really fun even when you're dying
[4:31:54] <%twistedj3ster> I AM RESPEC'ING OUT OF PURE MELEE
[4:31:55] <2deep5u> yeah he's just sluggish
[4:31:59] <BreakfastSampler> literally every snake you've met in this game has had arms
[4:32:01] <samuelfisk> They did in the Garden of Eden
[4:32:01] <jubejube56> Also you can do jump attacks and the like
[4:32:05] <TwistParabola> use L2
[4:32:11] <%Deft_Thought> Get ate
[4:32:11] <+orochiblood> yeah pure melee kinda sucks in this game
[4:32:11] <grollzar> snakes got arms if you tape them on tight enough
[4:32:13] <genmypoweralready> RIP
[4:32:15] <NewWillinium> It's a real ass fight
[4:32:15] <RubberFistFight> @TurtlesAndTentacles the good makes the bad worth it.
[4:32:16] <%soloshotfirst82> oh god the arms are coming out of two gaping wounds in his sides.
[4:32:16] <eleskei> does he have snake arthritis why wont he get off his ass
[4:32:16] <Ersov> @twistedj3ster no need to respec just for this fight
[4:32:16] <%crot454> not bad for first run
[4:32:17] <+RocketBarrel> damn almost
[4:32:19] <%Nekros4442> keep the shield
[4:32:19] <heartlesshealer> F
[4:32:20] <+kettleroot> mimic tear is really funny for this fight
[4:32:20] <$bcdenton> upgrade the spear and its much quicker
[4:32:21] <42nfl19> No summon for distraction?
[4:32:22] <2deep5u> big snek
[4:32:22] <eleskei> well hes dead
[4:32:23] <+MihriChan> Real fight!!!
[4:32:24] <%cade_calrayn> That's what you get for saying serpents can't swim, Pat
[4:32:25] <RyuuAoi> Ot today, Satan!
[4:32:25] <%TheAdMerlin> Pat, your mimic can use the weapon art to double bang him with the spear
[4:32:26] <%Valdorick> This snake is cooll
[4:32:26] <%JGardner03> Oh does the weapon have the beams on EVERY attack? I only used the L2
[4:32:27] <RyuuAoi> Not
[4:32:28] <%Zeroblazex> L2 has a Two string
[4:32:28] <jacksawjack> the floor is bodies
[4:32:29] <+Jeshk0> this snake ssssslithers
[4:32:29] <%NopeBadguy> i hated this fight, it felt like a cakewalk
[4:32:30] <%Nobrev> @TurtlesAndTentacles you can make some really cool busted builds early on in this game if you're worried about it being crazy difficult. it's also pretty chill to just wander around and explore
[4:32:30] <%Cigwynn> THey gave the snake arms so it can give hugs
[4:32:31] <+TeoXDR> he eat da gods
[4:32:31] <zecht89> double L2 for big stagger
[4:32:33] <Sunstalker> You got that spear talisman if you want a bit more dmg
[4:32:33] <+MarkoTolstov> the L2 is a 2 combo btw
[4:32:34] <TwistParabola> no, this snake Vores
[4:32:35] <+imkino_> upgrading spear helps
[4:32:36] <@QueequegTheater> @orochiblood Lmao no it doesn't
[4:32:37] <%Cozy90> u can upgrade the damage on this weapon btw
[4:32:37] <akitanito> I don't know why the lock on isn't on the bulk of the body and not the neck
[4:32:38] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Serpent =/= Snake. This is, like, Garden of Eden Serpent kind of deal. @PatStaresAt
[4:32:38] <ohno58> Well animated boss though
[4:32:39] <%KnifeyMcEdge> @kettleroot i was wondering that lol
[4:32:40] <+seaearthandsky> it gets worse
[4:32:41] <%MaybeFalco> hey pat, you know whats better than one person with a serpent hunter? two people with a serpent hunter
[4:32:42] <lonosis47> good first try tbh
[4:32:44] <KyberNasse> I just spammed the jump attack in this one
[4:32:48] <$realm_forge> His boss arena is off the chain tho
[4:32:51] <%JoshManVGH> That lady fucked a snake
[4:32:53] <+TeoXDR> weapon art followup is useful
[4:32:53] <%captain_thickthighs> ahhh cat no spoilers
[4:33:00] <%Nekros4442> @patstaresat the ash of war has a follow up bte
[4:33:01] <%discoinfierno> You know, it initially looks like a clenched fist when you walk up
[4:33:01] <%Cigwynn> I hope pat knows there's a follow up on the L2
[4:33:03] <%Nobrev> @PatStaresAt if you bust out the mimic it can use the spear's special abilities too
[4:33:04] <Augus7717> @JGardner03 yes on every attack it has that
[4:33:15] <rosabellamelantha> This fight is actually really fun
[4:33:16] <Tempmael> gotta boop his snoot
[4:33:18] <Tensolin01> L2 twice
[4:33:22] <%twistedj3ster> @Ersov It's not just this one, it's just the most recent I've seen to convince me
[4:33:23] <+abrupt_abe> You can upgrade the weapon too at the blacksmith
[4:33:31] <+wizard_of_diamonds> lava snake. Lava Snake. LAVA. SNAKE!
[4:33:31] <+MihriChan> Uppercut BABY
[4:33:36] <CrypticMochi> If only Dragon God was a gimmick fight that was real
[4:33:42] <%Valdorick> Upgrading the weapon is easy mode for this boss
[4:33:46] <Wheelskelet10> Followup cost no fp as well
[4:33:46] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Thanks Doods! Imma keep all of that in mind! @QueequegTheater @RubberFistFight @Nobrev
[4:33:48] <%Cozy90> pat u can upgrade weapon
[4:33:49] <%Nekros4442> super toxic
[4:33:50] <+InhumanMilitia> yep
[4:33:55] <%crimsonharvest> poison cloud ticks like an impact
[4:33:55] <2deep5u> you got cleopatra'd
[4:33:56] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt mimic fully copies the weapon, basically invalidating this fight
[4:33:56] <%Zeroblazex> I didn’t even know you could do that
[4:33:57] <%AHomeschoolDropout> DO IT
[4:33:58] <rosabellamelantha> it IS cheating
[4:33:58] <Sunstalker> the poison fog itself hurts
[4:34:00] <digaogrunge> Why no buff?
[4:34:02] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt The weapon is cheating
[4:34:02] <Estwilde> that's a strong poison
[4:34:02] <RyuuAoi> I mean you're doing it, Pat
[4:34:03] <%JustToWatch> penetrate that snussy Pat
[4:34:03] <+abrupt_abe> LUL
[4:34:03] <+kettleroot> ignore chat saying to. upgrae it, its pointless
[4:34:04] <%Valdorick> It super is. The L2 does 5K damage LUL
[4:34:04] <%Agami23> no, cheating is bringing in the mimic
[4:34:04] <%Cozy90> OH THATS CHEATING
[4:34:05] <r0flwaffles> ur level 154 pat
[4:34:06] <r0flwaffles> lol
[4:34:06] <%KnifeyMcEdge> it might for now
[4:34:07] <%RealThiele> acidic poison is melty
[4:34:07] <%Cozy90> >_>
[4:34:07] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Okay mr rot summon man
[4:34:08] <TwistParabola> whaaaaaat
[4:34:10] <+MihriChan> no balls!
[4:34:11] <%JoshManVGH> Do it! Cheat big!
[4:34:13] <+Nero_Cross> It becomes a Yhorm tier cakewalk if you upgrade the spear, ye
[4:34:13] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Use mimic tear to bully him
[4:34:14] <heartlesshealer> Pat? Against cheating?
[4:34:14] <+extantCadence> Does upgrading it even increase the damage on the special effect?
[4:34:15] <deviljhojho_> overconfidence
[4:34:15] <$vehementvadr> but if he snek then he has venom not poison
[4:34:15] <42nfl19> Mimic for more cheats?
[4:34:15] <+kettleroot> mimic tear with it if you feel like you need the help
[4:34:18] <+thickshield> says powerlevel pat /s
[4:34:18] <+silent__chief> jumping is cheating
[4:34:18] <GunEden> mimic tear makes this boss a joke
[4:34:18] <%Maids4lyfe> upgrading is not cheating
[4:34:18] <TwistParabola> that's cheating, he says
[4:34:19] <$Jaxnos> no, doing this with mimic is cheating. and it feels GREAT.
[4:34:21] <+Saunt> Gimmick fight why not
[4:34:21] <+imkino_> cheating is using mimic tear
[4:34:21] <Tensolin01> Idk if you can upgrade the weapon
[4:34:21] <Augus7717> summon mimic for double weapon @PatStaresAt
[4:34:23] <%luftraumm1> can you even beat it without the weapon?
[4:34:23] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> @NopeBadguy mimic just invalidates most fights regardless of weapon
[4:34:24] <Alrom> this fight without the weapon is really bs
[4:34:26] <+leyk36> THATS CHEATING
[4:34:28] <%twistedj3ster> this dissonance in the music is the best/worst
[4:34:30] <Mitchellsocks> this fight showcases the increased damage per combo hit more than anything
[4:34:30] <samuelfisk> If Pat says something
[4:34:32] <%captain_thickthighs> it's not cheating if you can get away with it
[4:34:33] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Charge the L2 pat
[4:34:35] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You can also stun lock this boss super easy too
[4:34:38] <RyuuAoi> Just throw some lightening at his ass
[4:34:38] <domukujira> i mean it is god devouring venom
[4:34:39] <NewWillinium> The beginning of the Boss Fight gives you an Opening for a Free L2 Combo. Does Big Damage
[4:34:39] <jubejube56> Lol okay noooooow Pat has a stance on cheating
[4:34:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> u ever seen a snake jump before
[4:34:42] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> a win is a win - Pat "not a cheater" Boivin
[4:34:47] <Trace_Bovier> channel your monster hunter skills
[4:34:49] <ArgentUndaCova> I didn't realise the weapon's regular attacks could also hit him, so as a unga bunga strength build with a smol FP bar, I had a rough time with this boss trying to time my L2 perfectly
[4:34:51] <lonosis47> LUL
[4:34:52] <%livi242> this game cheats so cheat back
[4:34:55] <+MihriChan> Chomp!
[4:34:59] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt mimic is ez modo
[4:35:00] <+InhumanMilitia> not really melee builds option without it is to hit the tail good luck with that
[4:35:01] <%Fenrisulfr_V> My shit-ass depth perception had me fucked up in this fight
[4:35:03] <%TheAdMerlin> It's fine to cheat, and use your Mimic
[4:35:06] <%RealThiele> that magma attack sucks
[4:35:10] <fistynopunches> miyazaki really likes snakes rolled up into balls huh?
[4:35:12] <heartlesshealer> got him to use the "player is far away" movesets, neat
[4:35:12] <KyberNasse> Jump attacks trivialized this fight for me
[4:35:17] <Mitchellsocks> @Fenrisulfr_V saaaae
[4:35:17] <%Niney_Who> If you spam the Art of War it stunlocks him
[4:35:18] <%mythcreant> YEAAH
[4:35:20] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeye
[4:35:20] <$Jaxnos> YEYEYEYE
[4:35:20] <+MihriChan> YEAAAH MIMIC
[4:35:22] <Mitchellsocks> *saME
[4:35:22] <%Cozy90> cheat more though
[4:35:23] <+RocketBarrel> YEAAAAH
[4:35:23] <%MaybeFalco> YEYEYE
[4:35:24] <lethallylactic> LUL
[4:35:25] <jubejube56> Well the mimic in this I think just stands in the magma and dies
[4:35:25] <+silent__chief> WIN BUTTON LES GO
[4:35:26] <%KnifeyMcEdge> @ArgentUndaCova i did the same thing for a bit
[4:35:27] <+silver__viii> THE BOY
[4:35:27] <@QueequegTheater> YEYEYEYE
[4:35:28] <2deep5u> summon your stand
[4:35:31] <@QueequegTheater> BULLY TIME
[4:35:31] <Augus7717> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE LUL
[4:35:31] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Think what's crazy about DOPPLEGANGER is that he can use your items
[4:35:31] <kingra> LUL
[4:35:32] <+seaearthandsky> thats correct
[4:35:33] <TwistParabola> THE BOY
[4:35:34] <%captain_thickthighs> get gooed
[4:35:36] <RenniGlo> YEEEE LETS GOOO
[4:35:36] <Saturation_Lizard> the mimic actually sucks at this fight, he runs into the lava and stunlocks himself
[4:35:36] <$Jaxnos> time to be your own Tarkus
[4:35:38] <Mitchellsocks> This is the real way to do this fight, it's hype
[4:35:38] <deviljhojho_> THE BOY
[4:35:38] <Omenaire_> LUL
[4:35:40] <Tensolin01> Best summon
[4:35:49] <ohno58> The way the bosses are balanced in this game i don't think using a mimic is cheating
[4:35:49] <%livi242> dying to the grab has a cool animation
[4:35:56] <2deep5u> lol the mimic just runs  into the lava
[4:36:00] <kingra> Oh no he's stupid
[4:36:04] <%Valdorick> Vore is never cool!
[4:36:09] <kingra> He's going into the lava LUL
[4:36:10] <ArgentUndaCova> @KnifeyMcEdge Oh yeah, seeing other people just attack him regularly (or do jump attacks) made me feel tad stupid LUL
[4:36:16] <%RealThiele> the lava makes most summons idiots here
[4:36:21] <%TheGuesty> no fucks mimic struts into lava
[4:36:22] <+Nero_Cross> Mimic AI uses the weapon's default range and doesn't understand the gimmick range
[4:36:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> wind lasers
[4:36:25] <%twistedj3ster> go get him, more-attractive-pat!
[4:36:25] <%Cigwynn> Mimic LOVES lava
[4:36:27] <+InhumanMilitia> chad mimic swan dives in lava
[4:36:33] <KyberNasse> I love how Ditto is still dumb
[4:36:34] <@QueequegTheater> Mimic Tear is like the Warrior of Light, he's a fighter not a thinker

[4:41:12] <Tensolin01> Imagine the party’s they threw in this room before all this
[4:41:13] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> SOP demo is out
[4:41:14] <@QueequegTheater> Spy got caught
[4:41:14] <Augus7717> one of his dudes got eaten i guess
[4:41:16] <%barrakuta371> hmmm
[4:41:16] <+MihriChan> SUS

[4:41:20] <%RealThiele> spy got vored
[4:41:20] <genmypoweralready> Of course he knew he's THE ALL KNOWING
[4:41:22] <%abakkus> gideon's a mf liar
[4:41:22] <%tetraes> He told u he was here
[4:41:23] <$realm_forge> OLD MAN EVIL
[4:41:23] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt his rune makes summons better
[4:41:26] <Voroniel> sussy wussy
[4:41:27] <TwistParabola> i mean the spy died
[4:41:27] <%Agami23> my guess is gideon sent someone in to figure out this shit and they got vored
[4:41:29] <KyberNasse> Snooping as usual I see
[4:41:29] <%Valdorick> Well yeah, this is one of the gods he doesn't need you to tell him about.
[4:41:30] <%luftraumm1> well he IS ALL KNOWING
[4:41:35] <+tizziks> there was a talk to melina option there
[4:41:37] <mrtanaka111> remember to come back to the arena after talking with his wife
[4:41:43] <Estwilde> Maybe not, if his spy didnt report back
[4:41:45] <%TheGuesty> he regenerates later to talk to snake daddy
[4:41:46] <+Kyma1020> He knew he was at Gelmir but didn't know exactly where due to his spy being eaten
[4:41:46] <+Pachi3000> ye
[4:41:46] <%bruuzer12> No, thats a different rune chat
[4:41:47] <heartlesshealer> To be fair, if the spy got eaten he couldn't report back I guess
[4:41:48] <%Valdorick> That's a lie. His Rune is life on kill. Mogh's is better summons.
[4:41:49] <Sunstalker> Pat, Gideon told you he was here LuL Remember?
[4:41:51] <ape_hawk> "yeah, he was a bitch"

[4:53:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> @bahookery strike a balance between weight, big number, and fashion
[4:53:29] <%notsoy> no sword though?
[4:53:36] <+stellarseeker> Kalameet's Ring
[4:53:37] <%Brassnarwhal> Calamity Ring
[4:53:38] <spoiledbadger> Hey Pat, I'm wondering if you're aware that Artisian Builds no longer exist because the CEO killed his company after rejecting a give away because the created was "Too Small" during a livestream
[4:53:38] <T_Sasquatch> @bahookery use whatever but there's noticeable differences
[4:53:42] <%Willowight> wow straight up predicted
[4:53:43] <%luftraumm1> where is his tower?
[4:53:43] <%RealThiele> sword is boss soul weapon iirc?
[4:53:43] <coziestbank> No snussy?
[4:53:44] <+tizziks> Ever talk to patches after killing boss?
[4:53:47] <VidulaSaix> Its REAL REAL GOOD
[4:53:51] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> His sword is busted good
[4:53:51] <Kain5707> are you able to get a red eye orb from no maidens guy now? @PatStaresAt
[4:53:52] <%Valdorick> Oh its really good
[4:53:54] <oda_flobunaga> It's actually just shit
[4:53:55] <+Verdantree> It's fantastic for your build
[4:53:59] <+orochiblood> his sword is incredibly OP
[4:53:59] <%Zeroblazex> His sword rivals the moonveil in damage
[4:54:00] <TheSandmanIsHere> it's the Behelit Sword, or at least as close as there is to it
[4:54:02] <RyuuAoi> Everybody dyin no lyin
[4:54:02] <zenith0111> Its the corpse sword he pulls out
[4:54:03] <+tnomads> which sword is pat talking about, the sword of the boss of this zone?
[4:54:04] <zecht89> it's a better version of what you're using now
[4:54:05] <%Zeroblazex> Even better against bosses
[4:54:06] <KyberNasse> It's pretty tight
[4:54:07] <%Valdorick> Its "I killed the super boss after I made it" good
[4:54:07] <%notsoy> where patches now
[4:54:13] <tri3dgE027> patches still hanging around?
[4:54:16] <42nfl19> @spoiledbadger Does not help that they lost some license for tax evasion lol
[4:54:17] <%Brassnarwhal> @kain5707 pretty sure he already has it
[4:54:17] <VidulaSaix> Probably my second favorite sword in the game
[4:54:19] <%JoshManVGH> Does that door open now?
[4:54:21] <+coldsama> His sword is great,dual wielding it with the Dung Eater Sword was very satisfying
[4:54:21] <Kaito_Cam> 1st or 2nd best faith greatsword in the game depending on what you are fighting.
[4:54:21] <+InhumanMilitia> did you get the whirly gig?

[4:54:44] <NewWillinium> I don't know if he appears anywhere after this
[4:54:48] <+tnomads> oh yeah the weapon skill hits for insane damage. Not as efficient FP wise as MLGS but it's better quick burst DMG
[4:54:54] <+KipTheSmuggler> his voice hasnt changed in 15 YEARS
[4:54:56] <Gray_LoFi> Oh that's a good line
[4:55:05] <TwistParabola> that's actually a great line
[4:55:08] <senfood> I kinda love Patches in this game.

[4:56:50] <%Brassnarwhal> people are so mad that faith finally caught up with the rest of the game
[4:56:51] <+extantCadence> You get the HP as long as an enemy dies while you're holding it, doesn't have to be a kill with a specific attack or even the sword itself
[4:56:51] <RyuuAoi> U S E I T

[4:57:02] <TheSandmanIsHere> this is what you use to cosplay the Skull Knight

[4:57:31] <%pabloelenano2> how do you even upgrade that thing...how does a stone helps what looks to be a sword made of flesh
[4:57:31] <%Brassnarwhal> @tnomads you can test them down below the balcony
[4:57:33] <%abakkus> is the peepee poopoo man still in his bedroom being all broody?
[4:57:37] <spoiledbadger> Hey Pat, did you hear that Artesian Builds is officially dead today?
[4:57:38] <+tizziks> you picked up an 8
[4:57:42] <Kaito_Cam> Imo it's the 1st or 2nd best greatsword in the game for faith builds
[4:57:49] <%bundle_of_herbs> maybe talk to grandpa after you found his pal's clothes?
[4:57:54] <%Zeroblazex> @patstaresat you can get it to +10 RIGHT NOW
[4:57:57] <42nfl19> \o/
[4:57:59] <%luftraumm1> kind of looks like blasphemous sword

[4:58:52] <tanarath> @ryuuaoi the ceo was a piece of shit & also a tax evader.
[4:58:55] <%Cozy90> That's hot
[4:59:00] <%Brassnarwhal> there are plenty of good options for every build you just have to find them
[4:59:03] <coziestbank> Just trading a bit of power for survivability
[4:59:04] <Kain5707> its a boss killer
[4:59:05] <%MaybeFalco> yo pat have you checked out that hammer you got from that fort in mt gelmir?
[4:59:07] <Kaito_Cam> In general this one is better but in certain situations there is a better weapon.

[5:00:00] <%Nobrev> @DestroPrime83 tax evasion and the CEO being a shitbag live on stream
[5:00:00] <Trace_Bovier> always got next builds I guess
[5:00:02] <+dilltacular> if you use fire scorpion talisman it does more damage
[5:00:02] <%baka_sugoi> Thank god i got my PC from them before they died LUL
[5:00:03] <%Brassnarwhal> not the same move
[5:00:05] <%abakkus> gz on unlocking Bloodwhetting
[5:00:06] <T_Sasquatch> I was so close to actually buying from them
[5:00:21] <%luftraumm1> mmmm
[5:00:26] <kingra> Aww it's worse
[5:00:26] <coziestbank> But you get healing
[5:00:27] <NewWillinium> Worse Damage, But better Weapon art and passive
[5:00:27] <digaogrunge> waaaay less
[5:00:30] <%JoshManVGH> But HP steal though?
[5:00:30] <42nfl19> But it has heals...but you are expected to not get hit anyway
[5:00:33] <tanarath> @ryuuaoi he didn't want a free pc to go to a small streamer so he shamed her on-stream, and changed the rules of the giveaway
[5:00:37] <%strakillias> Test the heal
[5:00:37] <+seaearthandsky> but the life steal
[5:00:37] <mrtanaka111> does it even matter at this point?
[5:00:38] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt but regen on hit
[5:00:38] <$vehementvadr> I mean it is evil
[5:00:41] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt at +10 it has better scaling making the damage gap slightly less bad
[5:00:44] <lethallylactic> But...number go down...
[5:00:45] <+tizziks> what's the heal like?
[5:00:46] <zenith0111> HP steal womt matter in boss fights tho
[5:00:47] <zecht89> try the weapon art
[5:00:51] <Kaito_Cam> @PatStaresAt it's kuz the gargoyle black blade does fire damage.
[5:00:53] <jacksawjack> you get hp restoreon kill vs none
[5:00:55] <%JGardner03> What was that blood swamp area, guess I missed that?
[5:00:58] <Twilightspfan> Too bad you cant use both, can you?
[5:01:00] <%luftraumm1> actually a matter of style at this point
[5:01:02] <+seaearthandsky> @zenith0111 are you nuts?
[5:01:04] <%Brassnarwhal> @zecht89 he did
[5:01:05] <%ShogunNoonto> So what cause the company to go under
[5:01:09] <jubejube56> Geez how many places can you talk to Melina now?
[5:01:11] <lethallylactic> DOOT
[5:01:13] <42nfl19> Is the heal on kill or hit/
[5:01:15] <%cade_calrayn> TOOOOOT
[5:01:15] <jubejube56> Or is it all just the same dialog?
[5:01:16] <%Agami23> its pretty good for exploring, less good for bosses is my guess
[5:01:17] <Sunstalker> Blackblade does HOLY, not fire?
[5:01:22] <+KipTheSmuggler> mosh piut
[5:01:24] <@QueequegTheater> He dooted right in your hace
[5:01:28] <DracaenaLeaf> DOOTOOT
[5:01:31] <Kaito_Cam> Black blade does Holy
[5:01:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> @ShogunNoonto PR nightmare and also tax fraud I think?
[5:01:36] <Kaito_Cam> Blaphemous does fire.
[5:01:37] <genmypoweralready> lol vampire
[5:01:38] <+Pachi3000> red go up
[5:01:38] <zenith0111> @42nfl19 Kill
[5:01:39] <adamant1333> dooot
[5:01:40] <akitanito> great for mobs
[5:01:40] <spoiledbadger> @patstaresat Sorry for pestering you about it, I was just curious.  Critical just did a video on it and I'm genuinely shocked.
[5:01:40] <RyuuAoi> @tanarath Wow. Now he lost his income and people out of jobs. Bet he will rebuild under a new name though. At least try to.
[5:01:40] <+MihriChan> Yooo that might be worth the less damager
[5:01:41] <+KipTheSmuggler> wow this turned into a musou game
[5:01:41] <%luftraumm1> oh
[5:01:41] <brainflint> ohhh it's worth it
[5:01:42] <eleskei> holy shit
[5:01:42] <+thickshield> wow. that is a lot
[5:01:46] <%strakillias> That's actually nuts
[5:01:47] <@QueequegTheater> Nice
[5:01:50] <@Spydurman> HOLY SHIT
[5:01:51] <+thickshield> i bet with the charm that heals on kill it would be super good
[5:01:52] <%Zeroblazex> @patstaresat that HP effect also works if the mimic or co op kill enemies
[5:01:58] <KyberNasse> Now add the talisman
[5:02:01] <XxMoliciousxX> lol oh man, I can't believe I didn't test that
[5:02:01] <+AGood_Noodle> This game fucks
[5:02:02] <coziestbank> That's a good sword
[5:02:04] <lethallylactic> Power staaaaaance
[5:02:06] <brainflint> easy mode
[5:02:10] <tanarath> @ryuuaoi given the irs is on his ass, I doubt it.
[5:02:11] <+MihriChan> OH
[5:02:11] <jaygee303> Where abouts is pat on the game? Just beat it an hour ago
[5:02:11] <+silver__viii> YEEEEEEAH

[5:02:15] <domukujira> yea mimic too
[5:02:15] <%notsoy> DRIZZT IT UP
[5:02:15] <akitanito> the delayed heal also helps you to just tank damage on cast huh
[5:02:15] <kingra> YEEEEEEEEEE
[5:02:15] <zecht89> exactly
[5:02:16] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt I mean while the heal is good,  it implies that you are expecting to get hit a lot
[5:02:16] <%luftraumm1> ooooooo
[5:02:16] <it_came_from_outer_space> yeeeaaaaa

[5:02:36] <%Brassnarwhal> @42nfl19 so does his boss healthbar

[5:02:54] <%JoshManVGH> Can you No Skill the Gargoyle Black Blade?
[5:02:54] <%Brassnarwhal> love this
[5:03:03] <akitanito> LUL
[5:03:08] <%luftraumm1> raging wolf best ser
[5:03:12] <@QueequegTheater> @JoshManVGH Dual wield takes the right handed skill
[5:03:20] <oda_flobunaga> That,s piontless
[5:03:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> nah it's unique isn't it?
[5:03:23] <%JoshManVGH> Does it have an ashes of war slot?
[5:03:31] <%JoshManVGH> Oooooh awesome!
[5:03:35] <+KipTheSmuggler> oh my
[5:03:41] <Sunstalker> I think he means take the art of war off it. Nope, its unique
[5:03:41] <+TheBitingIrish> 'No Skill' is shields only
[5:03:46] <+seaearthandsky> well that did damage
[5:03:49] <reasonance> somber upgraded weapons never let you swap skills AFAIK
[5:03:51] <%JoshManVGH> FUCK
[5:03:51] <+MihriChan> Thats dangerous
[5:03:52] <%Brassnarwhal> @joshmanvgh you can't and dont need to like queequeg saud
[5:03:53] <tri3dgE027> BIG damage
[5:04:01] <%GarbageNirvana> GarbageNirvana subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 52 months! I have beaten exactly three bosses in this game and every single one has required extensive summoning on my part, is this the part where people tell me to git gud
[5:04:01] <$SGrim> DAMAGE
[5:04:01] <genmypoweralready> Oh yeah. That fucks.
[5:04:02] <%captain_thickthighs> this game is plagued with flat ass
[5:04:02] <FeralFozzie> big strong
[5:04:02] <TwistParabola> beeeeg dmg
[5:04:02] <+MihriChan> Get his ASS
[5:04:04] <oda_flobunaga> Whelp, that's endgame damage right there
[5:04:06] <Tensolin01> Duel wielding feels amazing
[5:04:07] <%captain_thickthighs> cakeless
[5:04:09] <%xcompleasedad> OH
[5:04:10] <Kaito_Cam> There is another greatsword I think is stronger but it's from [Redacted]
[5:04:11] <Sol_Install> oh no
[5:04:13] <RyuuAoi> Number go up
[5:04:13] <%Brassnarwhal> this build FUCKS pat
[5:04:13] <digaogrunge> Gross sword is pretty good then
[5:04:15] <%MidnightBasker> If I were the Tarnished id take a bath to deal soap damage
[5:04:15] <domukujira> actual DEMON
[5:04:20] <+KipTheSmuggler> @PatStaresAt pat I just started dual weilding but with the COLLOSAL greatswords
[5:04:21] <%GarbageNirvana> So this is what endgame looks like eh
[5:04:27] <Sunstalker> @TheBitingIrish Nah, you can take them off weapons too. Usually becomes Kick. But all Somber sstone using weapons are locked in weaponarts and affinities
[5:04:29] <%xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt Has anyone warned you about the Last Boss bug?
[5:04:36] <+dilltacular> holy shit you have so many more talismans than me and were the same lvl
[5:04:36] <RyuuAoi> The fucking gargoyles, Pat.
[5:04:39] <tri3dgE027> Does the Chain Attack Talisman improve Powerstance hits?
[5:04:48] <genmypoweralready> There are so many ways to make yourself ridiculously powerful in this game that no one build is required
[5:04:51] <genmypoweralready> Which is fun
[5:05:01] <%Brassnarwhal> @dilltacular he scraped half of the game near clean
[5:05:02] <Kain5707> put on faith rune
[5:05:06] <+seaearthandsky> fire scorpion charm would be good
[5:05:13] <%luftraumm1> hp max makes sense if your always healing
[5:05:15] <coziestbank> the bloody thing near the bottom synergizes with the blasphemous?
[5:05:17] <Kaito_Cam> fire scorpion would help.
[5:05:18] <%GarbageNirvana> Legit thinking I might just do a summoner build honestly
[5:05:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> those max HP ones might be cool if you're healing all the time
[5:05:23] <@QueequegTheater> Increase fire damage
[5:05:25] <Sunstalker> Attack at Full HP since you can regain HP easily?
[5:05:26] <%Nekros4442> @patstaresat the flame empower me buff gives you phys and fire atk buffs right?
[5:05:28] <tri3dgE027> When in doubt, the stamina talisma LuL
[5:05:30] <rudiciuscaesar> Jesus, it's only 930 and Pat's been streaming for 5 hours? What an endurance run.
[5:05:32] <%Brassnarwhal> his hp max is already enormous
[5:05:34] <zecht89> jump boost is great for dual wielding
[5:05:36] <%tetraes> better jump attack is good
[5:05:36] <Onionchamp> Tree favor is always good
[5:05:39] <%JoshManVGH> You dodge like a boss, glass cannon should be fine
[5:06:10] <@QueequegTheater> That's one thick ass boy
[5:06:13] <+MihriChan> Murder time
[5:06:14] <NewWillinium> Cosplay Builds!
[5:06:18] <TheSandmanIsHere> nice
[5:06:21] <eleskei> u look like a warlord
[5:06:23] <%luftraumm1> use raging wolf!
[5:06:26] <+seaearthandsky> become huge
[5:06:34] <RyuuAoi> I can dig it
[5:06:43] <@QueequegTheater> fashion goblins
[5:06:43] <%Brassnarwhal> very cool
[5:06:48] <coziestbank> maximum poise and just keep swinging
[5:06:49] <akitanito> no reason
[5:06:56] <digaogrunge> Bloody Wolf is the best set, screw defenses
[5:06:57] <+MihriChan> Oh thats good
[5:07:06] <%luftraumm1> cool ASS
[5:07:07] <Purpleleven> Become sword
[5:07:09] <tri3dgE027> 58 poise is enough
[5:07:09] <lethallylactic> Become the Crucible Knight
[5:07:10] <Sunstalker> Yeah and uise crucible miracles. They're empowered by the set
[5:07:12] <+tizziks> I like the tree helm more than the axe, but both are sick
[5:07:16] <it_came_from_outer_space> nice pauldrons
[5:07:17] <SamHellbent> elden bling Kreygasm
[5:07:20] <DestroPrime83> these outfits are cool
[5:07:23] <RyuuAoi> Noice
[5:07:38] <huskarl_zap> no sell
[5:07:40] <%MidnightBasker> elden sing
[5:07:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> woof
[5:07:44] <FeralFozzie> wow
[5:07:49] <lethallylactic> monkaS
[5:07:49] <huskarl_zap> harder than demigods
[5:07:51] <TwistParabola> this dude is actually really tough at his level
[5:07:52] <%luftraumm1> this dude's damage !!!!!
[5:07:54] <%MaybeFalco> he's so overtuned
[5:07:54] <TrashManRising> holy fuck
[5:07:55] <tanarath> F
[5:07:55] <it_came_from_outer_space> He's cool
[5:07:57] <rosabellamelantha> He's SO STRONG
[5:08:00] <TwistParabola> he is!!!!
[5:08:02] <+badhaye> wait where's this one at?
[5:08:03] <zenith0111> Wheres that at?
[5:08:03] <mike2hands> wait i though you beat him already?
[5:08:05] <oda_flobunaga> LUL I did him with 20 Vigor
[5:08:05] <Khester824> you gotta roll in
[5:08:06] <Boombay1213> He can be parried
[5:08:07] <Sol_Install> he super strong holy shit
[5:08:08] <TwistParabola> he's not so tough in other zones
[5:08:08] <+badhaye> nm
[5:08:11] <digaogrunge> Why isnt he the Elden Lord?
[5:08:11] <%captain_thickthighs> he a literal edgelord
[5:08:12] <Ghufufin> the biggest of numbers
[5:08:13] <%tetraes> How are the fakes stronger than the real one lol
[5:08:13] <%MaybeFalco> he doesn't even give anything good
[5:08:13] <Kain5707> arent you using stuff hes immune to though
[5:08:14] <lethallylactic> He fixed the scaling on his own sword monkaS
[5:08:17] <it_came_from_outer_space> But imo these guys are not that hard to dodge
[5:08:17] <Twilightspfan> Did that guy have a flying sword?
[5:08:18] <%JoshManVGH> Fucking lightsaber force weilding mother fucker
[5:08:25] <Sunstalker> Stuff like this is why Caelid level progression IS SO FUCKED. How is that not endgame?
[5:08:29] <DestroPrime83> Just force weilding like a boss
[5:08:35] <%Cozy90> i like the sclae set except the helm
[5:08:35] <Khester824> have more aggression than the boss
[5:08:35] <%Brassnarwhal> overleveled pat isn't overleveled enough i guess
[5:08:45] <42nfl19> Do we ever get a chance to Force wield weapons?
[5:08:47] <+seaearthandsky> look at this fuckin zappa ass mother fucker
[5:08:54] <%scarman125> I got jumped by him earlier and beat him first try. he was tricky but he definitely seems scaled off your level cause he wasn't doing nearly this much damage.
[5:08:55] <%luftraumm1> seens like
[5:09:12] <+silent__chief> roll baited
[5:09:13] <Guardiansaiyan> DEEZ NUTS: Elden Ring edition
[5:09:14] <%luftraumm1> that delay is a bastard
[5:09:17] <akitanito> fucking force users
[5:09:19] <Sunstalker> @scarman125 No, each spot he's at is different strengths. Not scaled
[5:09:19] <FeralFozzie> force pull
[5:09:22] <+thickshield> enemies hit so hard, and scaling works in such a way that levels dont do much aside from lowering the total damage enemies do to you... which matters little in a game that two hits you
[5:09:23] <%AHomeschoolDropout> I'm shocked how much Vigor makes a difference in this one compared to the other souls games.
[5:09:25] <%Brassnarwhal> @scarman125 were you in this location? he has a few different invasions
[5:09:25] <+TheBitingIrish> Can this fucker be backstabbed?
[5:09:26] <42nfl19> MR SHEEP
[5:09:26] <zenith0111> Im level 133 and the new new new zone I just entered mobs are fucking me up
[5:09:29] <+MihriChan> collateral goat
[5:09:29] <+silver__viii> not the sheep D:
[5:09:31] <%luftraumm1> he took a goat along with you
[5:09:32] <+silent__chief> that shoulder charge was badass
[5:09:33] <+gruff_gridof> double kill
[5:09:33] <tanarath> F
[5:09:33] <ryowildfire> that poor sheep
[5:09:33] <SamHellbent> NO GOAT!
[5:09:33] <%oAznoUta> does this dude scale with your own level or what?
[5:09:33] <%JoshManVGH> Fucked up a goat too
[5:09:34] <Twilightspfan> He us an actual jedi
[5:09:34] <%SiegfangArchitectofSin> He works out...
[5:09:35] <%MorelK> you're just a sheep to him
[5:09:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> everything is all over the place strength wise, you could one shot a boss 10 feet from a different boss that one shots you
[5:09:40] <$Artoo__The_Me> I wanna force fight
[5:09:41] <oda_flobunaga> GIT Gud Skrub
[5:09:45] <tanarath> Rip sheep
[5:09:45] <digaogrunge> wow what a bitch
[5:09:48] <%MaybeFalco> there's no point, he gives shit for souls and he only gives the bell for gravity consumables
[5:09:50] <@QueequegTheater> He's harder than the acctual superbosses
[5:09:53] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt You have to parry Bell Bearing Hunter TWICE to be able to riposte him
[5:09:55] <%scarman125> @scarman125 oh I didn't realize that's how it worked. interesting thanks for the info.
[5:09:58] <Sunstalker> The bells he drops are just not worth the bother with this asshole
[5:09:59] <%luftraumm1> 2k!!!
[5:09:59] <RyuuAoi> You can do it!
[5:09:59] <%Brassnarwhal> rip goat
[5:10:01] <$vehementvadr> caelid truly is the Florida of dark souls
[5:10:03] <akitanito> what the fuck goats
[5:10:03] <$Artoo__The_Me> I also love the music of these dudes
[5:10:06] <%NovaKnightmare> goat aggro
[5:10:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> that dude just has some massive resistances huh?
[5:10:15] <Twilightspfan> Is that a t rex?
[5:10:19] <@QueequegTheater> Those goats are absolute madmen
[5:10:30] <%Cozy90> sword looks like it was stuck in the eclipse for years
[5:10:31] <coziestbank> The fire source tear might make the weapon art REALLY strong
[5:10:32] <fistynopunches> are the dog mutants meant to be cattle dogs?
[5:10:33] <%AHomeschoolDropout> I'm very excited to see pat fight THAT superboss Kappa
[5:10:43] <%scarman125> now where do I get the bell bearing to buy feathers cause I am sick and fucking tired of farming eagles.
[5:10:53] <Boombay1213> Soul edge vibes from that sword
[5:11:03] <%BonewheelVanguard> @PatStaresAt looks like a Nurgle sword
[5:11:07] <%Nekros4442> yep

[5:15:23] <Guardiansaiyan> @MidnightBasker Pat is becoming the Dragon of Dogima
[5:15:23] <azure_dunes> wait you can get carian retaliation as an ash of war???
[5:15:25] <jubejube56> I’d love to see a run of this where one fights godrick last
[5:15:27] <oda_flobunaga> Caca carnivore
[5:15:57] <akitanito> more healing
[5:16:07] <%JoshManVGH> Even MORE HP
[5:16:09] <%BlueLunecy> It's defeating
[5:16:12] <+ImmaterialHero> It's defeating, I think it's a borked text thing
[5:16:14] <+HibikiYamada> it is when they're killed
[5:16:18] <42nfl19> lifesteall all day everyday?
[5:16:18] <+extantCadence> It means defeating
[5:16:23] <azure_dunes> oh nice, bloodborne rally but with more steps
[5:16:24] <+HibikiYamada> it's pretty good, too.
[5:16:26] <+DrFacilier> So with the blade, rune and talisman will all that healing stack?
[5:16:32] <%luftraumm1> raging WOOOOOOLD
[5:16:33] <jubejube56> Oh Radagon’s “union”
[5:16:38] <samuelfisk> Yes all three stack
[5:16:40] <Sunstalker> there's a serpent god sword that also does the effect, ,I think?
[5:16:41] <oda_flobunaga> How about a run of this where the 2 Great runes you get are Morgott's and Malenia"s
[5:16:43] <plaguedoctor_vi> there a rune that is per attack but it later
[5:16:49] <oda_flobunaga> and only those two
[5:16:53] <ape_hawk> did you guys hear that homelander punched a chef in spain and is now serving a 1-year suspended prison sentence?
[5:16:55] <jubejube56> Do they ever say Radagon “married” Marika or have they said “union” the whole time
[5:16:57] <%luftraumm1> i prefer the raging wolf helm
[5:17:02] <jubejube56> Given what we know now
[5:17:05] <%tetraes> @oda_flobunaga  impossible city wont open without 2
[5:17:15] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @oda_flobunaga You can't enter the capital without two runes.
[5:17:37] <samuelfisk> @jubejube56 They do describe Radagon as leaving Rennala to marry Marika
[5:17:37] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt lower capital
[5:17:38] <rekinom> Radagon's talisman is almost worthless, especially if you charge spells. Like 2-3 frames faster @PatStaresAt
[5:17:46] <it_came_from_outer_space> flush yourself down a toilet
[5:17:49] <plaguedoctor_vi> @jubejube56 Radagon married Renala, there something about Radagon and Marika but it later if Pat does the Goldmask quest
[5:17:53] <%cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @patstaresat Is this Game still good so far?
[5:17:55] <oda_flobunaga> Lower Capital church
[5:18:11] <%luftraumm1> keep it
[5:18:11] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt When I wear the Winged Sword Insignia and another one later that does the same thing when you proc bleed, my dual katanas each have an AR over 900.
[5:18:12] <rosabellamelantha> @jubejube56 he already did it
[5:18:14] <Saturation_Lizard> maybe the FP on kill talisman for extra vampirism build?
[5:18:18] <sweatch0> boc check how's your friendly little man?
[5:18:19] <Sunstalker> Godewick's talisman better?
[5:18:27] <samuelfisk> @plaguedoctor_vi He did the Goldmask thing earlier this stream
[5:18:33] <Sunstalker> The one that boosts charged spell attacks is good
[5:18:35] <DestroPrime83> @plaguedoctor_vi he did the statue that says the thing about marika and radagon
[5:18:36] <%Nobrev> @plaguedoctor_vi he did the goldmask stuff earlier
[5:18:38] <%Cozy90> erd tree talisman always great
[5:18:52] <rekinom> the lower FP cost one is pretty good
[5:18:59] <plaguedoctor_vi> Ok so i can say that Radagon is Marika
[5:19:13] <rekinom> hard to go wrong with havel's
[5:19:14] <%cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> Yo chat, is this game still good so far?
[5:19:17] <Sunstalker> Just use Godfrey's to boost your lightning spear even higher
[5:19:27] <%luftraumm1> thats you favorite eh
[5:19:32] <%Cozy90> alot of the best talismans are in the same area
[5:19:55] <%LeiaSkynoober> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy Big good!
[5:19:55] <DestroPrime83> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy it never stopped being good
[5:19:57] <reasonance> y'all cowards afraid to fat roll
[5:19:59] <Midnight188> he's dangerously based!
[5:20:11] <it_came_from_outer_space> he's not using lightning spear anymore, he's a rock tosser now
[5:20:17] <oda_flobunaga> Naw
[5:20:20] <+pearsnickety> Pat! All Star Battle! mbtygoSTIMULATE
[5:20:25] <+LandOfTheWay> dammit, i just got back and i missed the capital boss, didn't i?
[5:20:26] <ape_hawk> wow, ur such a paladin, pat
[5:20:32] <%Cozy90> only light roll for me psaDab psaDab
[5:20:36] <DestroPrime83> Did pat finish Ranni's quest?
[5:20:42] <domukujira> skull knight cosplay
[5:20:44] <rosabellamelantha> he did
[5:20:49] <+LandOfTheWay> @DestroPrime83 yes
[5:20:50] <KobeTeeth90> damn
[5:20:54] <plaguedoctor_vi> @DestroPrime83 yes
[5:20:55] <KobeTeeth90> pats a str8 savage
[5:21:00] <rudiciuscaesar> if these guys aren't elite guard, then I'd  hate to see the actual elite guard, that dude just tanked 1,200 damage
[5:21:08] <%GarbageNirvana> Speaking of skeletons I wonder if Paige found the skeletal militiamen summon yet
[5:21:12] <DestroPrime83> Im gonna miss cool blue witch moon lady :C
[5:21:22] <+twdlrr> Of fuck it is the benefit sword isn't it
[5:21:30] <+twdlrr> Behelit
[5:21:31] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt Did you explore the secret area at the very beginning of the game that you can only access with a stonesword?
[5:21:35] <%RealThiele> im glad Dark souls and its kind are places where cool berserk stuff resides. makes the manga being cutoff less painful
[5:21:38] <RyuuAoi> Man, I miss Pat playing RE4. Sorry. Just feeling it rn.
[5:21:40] <Sunstalker> Remember old dark souls where you could do like 10 special moves with the secret dragontail weapons? Tey've come a long way with them
[5:21:40] <TrashManRising> pocket sand!
[5:21:44] <rudiciuscaesar> lol what was that enemy's plan there....
[5:21:49] <azure_dunes> that sewerussy
[5:21:56] <it_came_from_outer_space> he did @AHomeschoolDropout
[5:21:56] <CheeseBurgerHelper> What kind of talisman is Pat using? I've been playing for nearly 80 hours and I'm still using the finger talisman
[5:22:04] <%cade_calrayn> this is not the sewers
[5:22:11] <%cade_calrayn> this is just the gutter
[5:22:11] <%luftraumm1> if the remake ever comes out we might see him play it
[5:22:14] <rudiciuscaesar> so what, is...Ranni even still involved with the plot at this point for Pat?
[5:22:16] <%RealThiele> this is very much NOT the sewers
[5:22:17] <reasonance> weapon arts are so busted, even a bunch of the ashes you can put on normal weapons are nuts
[5:22:18] <DestroPrime83> Why did they ever try making a berserk game? FromSoft was doing it the whole time!
[5:22:24] <Saturation_Lizard> only true for the weapon art, everything else is via killing
[5:22:30] <Sunstalker> Idk why people are telling you go to the sewers? You can't acces Dungeater sewers yet, chat?
[5:22:33] <%Brassnarwhal> @cheeseburgerhelper he's using the beast talisman
[5:22:33] <%Cozy90> fuckin capra demon
[5:22:37] <akitanito> need to kill for hp
[5:22:38] <RyuuAoi> @luftraumm1 GivePLZ
[5:22:39] <+Nomenanza> once again the description lies
[5:22:42] <Midnight188> @rudiciuscaesar she is waiting for him to become Elden Lord so she and him can usher in her Ending.
[5:22:44] <Saturation_Lizard> huh, guess it lies, thanks elden ring
[5:22:44] <Estwilde> I still can hardly believe that, after all this time, we got this game and it's this good.
[5:22:45] <Kain5707> yea its a lie
[5:22:46] <%RealThiele> Omen #4
[5:22:47] <%LeiaSkynoober> It steals a little bit of hp
[5:22:48] <plaguedoctor_vi> it per death only
[5:22:49] <rekinom> HP steal on kill
[5:22:57] <%twohitgood> kill or is it like pontiff's left eye?
[5:22:58] <rudiciuscaesar> @Cozy90 totally thought the same thing
[5:23:01] <KobeTeeth90> tiniest amount of hp
[5:23:02] <%RealThiele> it gave like 5-7% back on the kill
[5:23:02] <yyyyfdugyu> :tf: problem
[5:23:04] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Dungeater gave you a key right?
[5:23:04] <%tetraes> @Sunstalker  u can i did the sewers before Morghott
[5:23:06] <+HibikiYamada> @Sunstalker wdym? you can go down a well.
[5:23:09] <42nfl19> so it sucks on 1v1 fights?
[5:23:11] <%Brassnarwhal> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[5:23:12] <plaguedoctor_vi> yes the descrption is bad, the rune that is hp per hit is later on
[5:23:13] <rudiciuscaesar> @Midnight188 oh ok,  I wasn't sure if Pat was going the other route or not, thank you.
[5:23:26] <domukujira> yea look for a well
[5:23:30] <%JumboCrunchies> I've been trying to figure out how to get down into the Sewers. Been giving me issues all day. This whole city has me running in circles.
[5:23:34] <$vehementvadr> big dungus gave you a key?
[5:23:42] <%RealThiele> Handy key
[5:23:42] <Midnight188> @rudiciuscaesar he did literally just kill the questgiver for the other Ending so....safe to say that one's locked off.
[5:23:43] <reasonance> can you choose a different ending after doing ranni's quest?
[5:23:46] <jubejube56> Iirc the sewers are down a well
[5:23:48] <HeroToxiko> @42nfl19 it's an ug with an aoe, it's for groups
[5:23:48] <jubejube56> Or something
[5:23:55] <oda_flobunaga> SO yes, Pat can do the sewers then
[5:23:56] <Tempmael> poopsmith is no more?
[5:23:56] <Sunstalker> Every well I looked for didn't lead me anywhere. I guess I'm stupid.
[5:24:04] <athuramn> @reasonance yes
[5:24:07] <%justcallmebobplease> Did that one swing just perfectly miss you?
[5:24:10] <plaguedoctor_vi> @reasonance yes, there only one ending that locks you character
[5:24:12] <Saturation_Lizard> @reasonance yes, ranni becomes an option at the end
[5:24:20] <NewWillinium> Alright I'm back, had to handle some Puppy shenanigans, did I miss much?
[5:24:24] <it_came_from_outer_space> lol
[5:24:25] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt by the way you can either do dung eater's quest or murder him immediately, unless you want to lose that shrimp selling bro I reccomend murder
[5:24:26] <rudiciuscaesar> @Midnight188 just jumped in after getting home from work, didn't see Pat ice anyone other than some normal enemies so far.
[5:24:32] <+Funky_Honkey> blighttown  4
[5:24:34] <oda_flobunaga> Here we fucking go
[5:24:36] <Sunstalker> @justcallmebobplease Dude, I have had enemies stab me over my shoulder and miss.
[5:24:37] <rekinom> sword heals about 10% of max HP per kill
[5:24:39] <%RealThiele> I want to go home...
[5:24:42] <%Deft_Thought> I hope there's no dung down here
[5:24:47] <RyuuAoi> Please be rats. Please be rats. Please be rats!
[5:24:48] <%NopeBadguy> he's LOATHESOME
[5:24:50] <Kain5707> big murder
[5:24:51] <+sermittens> you can get him as a summon
[5:24:52] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> of all types of swamps, could a part in the soulsborne series be considered a "time swamp"?
[5:24:54] <HeroToxiko> but he's saaaaad
[5:24:55] <%NovaKnightmare> you know he eats shit, right? Why do a quest for a dude who eats shit?
[5:24:56] <TheSandmanIsHere> you still have Seluvis' potion?
[5:24:57] <%tetraes> Dungeater gives access to an ending
[5:24:58] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt if selvius was still alive, you could also turn dung eater into a puppet for you to summon
[5:25:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> you'll never know if he turns into the Lovable dung eater tho Kappa
[5:25:01] <+JustToWatch> do you still have that potion from selorius
[5:25:01] <+Freakin_Wolfy> how long has pat been wandering the capital for? I just spent like 3 hours trying to remember where to go before I just looked it up
[5:25:01] <%luftraumm1> it's all sung all the way down
[5:25:02] <+Edrem> missed out on puppetizing him?
[5:25:07] <+Funky_Honkey> why is it always dung?
[5:25:08] <%Cozy90> good luck. this place is crazy
[5:25:08] <genmypoweralready> He's literally a pile of shit
[5:25:10] <%RealThiele> not hot enough for morally grey
[5:25:11] <Saturation_Lizard> yeah this is a REAL zone
[5:25:11] <%SuckerPunchSyd> That dude can eat shit LUL
[5:25:15] <kingra> @BeatBoxersDevMike Ringed city
[5:25:15] <%Puhff> His ending sucks too
[5:25:16] <it_came_from_outer_space> the sewers are not small
[5:25:16] <Namillus> @BeatBoxersDevMike The part before the Ringed City in Ringed City
[5:25:18] <rosabellamelantha> sewers are just the swamp of the city
[5:25:18] <reasonance> I like that the dung eating isn't even what makes him an asshole, it's just a bonus
[5:25:20] <athuramn> this place suuuuuucks
[5:25:21] <ape_hawk> no, but then youll read a lore item that says Dung Eater volunteered at the soup shelter and cured cancer
[5:25:22] <%barrakuta371> The Shunning Grounds is a hell of a name
[5:25:22] <genmypoweralready> RATS RATS WE ARE THE RATS
[5:25:22] <Saturation_Lizard> its like a legacy dungeon under a legacy dungeon
[5:25:23] <CheeseBurgerHelper> Dang you have to be super evil for Pat to hate you
[5:25:23] <RyuuAoi> Yeeeeaaahh!
[5:25:24] <rudiciuscaesar> shunning grounds....tha tmigh tbe one of the "the worst"
[5:25:27] <+extantCadence> Dung eater gets to have his own ending
[5:25:27] <ArgentUndaCova> Literal Peepee Poopoo Man
[5:25:28] <ape_hawk> and feel bad for him
[5:25:30] <%RealThiele> ITS A WHOLE ZONE
[5:25:33] <TrickyTrouT> this area suxxxxxxxxxx
[5:25:34] <NewWillinium> @TheSandmanIsHere Are you hinting that you can give Ding-Eater the Puppet potion?
[5:25:40] <%justcallmebobplease> @Sunstalker it's rare I run into a hitbox where I feel it's even slightly unfair in this.  It's not perfect, but I'm struggling to think of a non-fighting-game with hitboxes this clean.
[5:25:47] <HeroToxiko> @Puhff is it just planet piss but poop?
[5:25:50] <Sunstalker> @TheSandmanIsHere Yup. Only way.
[5:25:53] <%Brassnarwhal> *Revachol*
[5:26:03] <rosabellamelantha> unless they are fire resistant yes
[5:26:03] <rekinom> It does a ton of damage and can multihit if the boss is big
[5:26:04] <@QueequegTheater> @justcallmebobplease Some of the grabs are a bit iffy
[5:26:04] <+678saintglock> what if when you rolled in this zone you got a poop status
[5:26:07] <%Nekros4442> Like you wouldnt believe
[5:26:08] <Kain5707> its melts them
[5:26:08] <rosabellamelantha> also the OST for this zone is great
[5:26:10] <+Funky_Honkey> here we go
[5:26:18] <RubberFistFight> @Brassnarwhal WELCOME TO REVACHOL
[5:26:19] <reasonance> talisman to reduce skill FP cost has been a favorite of mine for a while
[5:26:22] <+LandOfTheWay> chunky boy
[5:26:25] <+HibikiYamada> god i fucking hate this enemy type
[5:26:25] <rosabellamelantha> the OST here is SUPER kingsfield
[5:26:27] <%RealThiele> regular enemy now
[5:26:30] <RyuuAoi> Yo he beefy
[5:26:36] <huskarl_zap> now. are these guys omen?
[5:26:38] <Midnight188> dungeater just turns the Elden Ring into a trollface and then disappears back to Reddit like the gross man he is
[5:26:38] <genmypoweralready> LUL
[5:26:38] <RyuuAoi> Okay that makes sense
[5:26:43] <partyshart> 140k souls
[5:26:44] <toyforus235> oh no
[5:26:44] <Kain5707> these guys fucking suck
[5:26:46] <oda_flobunaga> LUL
[5:26:47] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt so the path to the ultra optional zone i told you about involves a room full of lobsters.
[5:26:49] <it_came_from_outer_space> lol
[5:26:50] <%Cozy90> that guy is now the giant rat
[5:26:52] <+Funky_Honkey> this zone is for real
[5:26:53] <%Puhff> @herotoxiko yup just a color change of the base ending
[5:26:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> so we just dump the mutant omen babies in the sewer?
[5:27:02] <%RealThiele> ngl i stealthed past most of these guys
[5:27:03] <ohno58> Pat just forgets he takes damage
[5:27:03] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> crutch gone!

[5:27:26] <oda_flobunaga> @RubberFistFight then there's the optional zone past the other optional Boss
[5:27:36] <%Nekros4442> let him get to a grace first....
[5:27:44] <%Puhff> Worst lorethrough ever :(
[5:27:46] <%justcallmebobplease> @QueequegTheater as I was typing that I couldn't help but think of a particular bloody grappler, yeah... is it strange that I enjoy how busted it is since it feels 'fair'?
[5:27:48] <plaguedoctor_vi> there a site of grace at that place you fouth that Oger Pat
[5:27:48] <reasonance> these rats do not fuck around
[5:27:50] <athuramn> idk if it's new tbh, I just realized that it took me half the game to realize that was even a prompt
[5:27:53] <RubberFistFight> @oda_flobunaga we'll tell him when he gets there. @QueequegTheater missed that bit and he's so mad in my discord about it LUL
[5:27:55] <digaogrunge> Runes At Risk
[5:27:56] <ArgentUndaCova> Huh, I've never found this place mopO
[5:27:59] <%RealThiele> rune arcs for life
[5:28:04] <@QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight >:(
[5:28:07] <rekinom> 10% of max PogChamp
[5:28:09] <+LandOfTheWay> think he meant talk to melina at that specific grace, cause she has specific dialogue at certain ones
[5:28:29] <%Puhff> LOOOOORE
[5:28:34] <ohno58> Who is your mom?
[5:28:35] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt When you get back down there, there's a grace on the left in a side room past the big fat omen
[5:28:37] <%Niney_Who> She set her own Parameters
[5:28:46] <Kain5707> you can literally get this at any grace
[5:28:49] <Kain5707> jesus chat
[5:28:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> thats punk rock

[5:29:00] <%justcallmebobplease> Does anyone know if you can un-cancel the Frenzy Ending?  I know about using the thing to cancel it once you're on track for it, but is it permanently gone if cancelled?

[5:31:19] <AlmejasPerezosos> This is not Ring Fit Adventures.!
[5:31:23] <RyuuAoi> Like a PIMP
[5:31:27] <%JGardner03> What's the level cap that the communtity decided?
[5:31:42] <oda_flobunaga> Its very deapthsy
[5:31:43] <rudiciuscaesar> Blight Town but more towny
[5:31:43] <%RealThiele> 120~?
[5:31:44] <Kain5707> it is
[5:31:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> sticks and stones may break my bones but this boulder'll REALLY hurt
[5:31:55] <plaguedoctor_vi> the sewers is fun zone
[5:31:55] <Midnight188> @JGardner03 150 afaik
[5:31:55] <ape_hawk> nah, if it was blighttown, youd be dropping frames
[5:31:55] <@QueequegTheater> @JGardner03 150, anyone who says lower is falling for PvP nerd memes
[5:31:55] <%Puhff> Wonder whats up with all this Omen stuff
[5:31:57] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @JGardner03 For PvP, 100-120.
[5:32:01] <domukujira> tunnel town
[5:32:03] <%Cozy90> This is blight town 1-2-2.5 rolled into 1
[5:32:06] <+ajeanstarks78 > @patstaresat easy  point of grace is P.O.G
[5:32:14] <%JumboCrunchies> I dig the skeleton look
[5:32:17] <%luftraumm1> use it on what?
[5:32:20] <athuramn> look at all the card packs he can open D:
[5:32:25] <%Brassnarwhal> sticks and stones may break my bones but barricade will never falter
[5:32:26] <RyuuAoi> What're ya buyin?
[5:32:27] <rudiciuscaesar> @Kain5707 yeah, echoes, yeah, I called them souls constantly lol. Although I did call lanterns, lanterns
[5:32:29] <digaogrunge> All of them? Why?
[5:32:31] <akitanito> why is using these runes still so tedious?
[5:32:32] <rosabellamelantha> PVP people are dumb most builds feel like SHIT at 120
[5:32:32] <%Cozy90> blight town. more like blight city
[5:32:34] <it_came_from_outer_space> you really dont need to level anymore
[5:32:35] <%MartinOfLoxley> This just reminded me of people buying Runes on ebay
[5:32:52] <rudiciuscaesar> no no, always level, can always be HUGER
[5:32:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> why not tho
[5:32:52] <42nfl19> NUMBER GO BIG
[5:32:53] <@QueequegTheater> @MartinOfLoxley Oh god I saw that
[5:32:54] <it_came_from_outer_space> im with you
[5:32:54] <athuramn> good lord
[5:32:54] <reasonance> I just hit 115 without any grinding and I'm only slightly further than pat, which is to say quite a ways off from the end still
[5:32:56] <rosabellamelantha> BECOME HUGE
[5:32:57] <%AHomeschoolDropout> I NEED MORE POWER
[5:32:57] <%twohitgood> but...huge quest.
[5:32:58] <+Grayhammatter> nah, level all day
[5:32:59] <+silent__chief> you don't ever "not need to level"
[5:32:59] <it_came_from_outer_space> that would be okay i guess
[5:33:00] <%Agami23> what if 99 vigor?
[5:33:00] <athuramn> almost 400k
[5:33:01] <RyuuAoi> Pat, you hit hard cap?
[5:33:01] <%notsoy> WHAT IF NUMBER BIGGER
[5:33:03] <CheeseBurgerHelper> You make a compelling argument
[5:33:05] <+Edrem> Malenia will always make you want to level more LUL
[5:33:05] <Kain5707> @rudiciuscaesar yup just to much normal souls to stop saying bonfire
[5:33:05] <%RealThiele> Huge quest
[5:33:06] <%twohitgood> always get huge-er
[5:33:09] <$Jaxnos> can't fault that logic
[5:33:12] <athuramn> nvm, past that LUL
[5:33:14] <NewWillinium> "What if I leveled up more?"  This is the way
[5:33:16] <%Puhff> STRENGTH GO UP
[5:33:16] <jubejube56> Bigger number
[5:33:18] <rudiciuscaesar> like in Dragon Ball, when Master Roshi says to Goku there will always be someone stronger, someone even more huge.
[5:33:19] <%xcompleasedad> What if you MIGHT have overleveled?
[5:33:20] <+twdlrr> Big flashbacks to the Hero's of the Storm stream
[5:33:23] <+MihriChan> Embiggen......
[5:33:24] <digaogrunge> Save some until you find a shop and you have to go grind for some bullshit, I dunno
[5:33:26] <InuOblivion> Huge Quest
[5:33:27] <%Brassnarwhal> NUMBER GO UP
[5:33:28] <Frostydough1> why would you NOT get stronger tf?
[5:33:30] <RyuuAoi> Get a boss life bar going up there
[5:33:32] <ohno58> I would say save for upgrade materials when you're able to buy them but...
[5:33:33] <%MartinOfLoxley> Hey @PatStaresAt What do you think about RMT for runes happening?
[5:33:35] <Kain5707> LMAO
[5:33:37] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt can you talk to Melina at that grace or no?
[5:33:44] <Kain5707> 400k 2 levels
[5:33:46] <%luftraumm1> psaBig belief
[5:33:52] <%RealThiele> RMT for runes when farm spots exist is lul
[5:33:56] <%justcallmebobplease> @digaogrunge Probably has enough Rune consumables in his inventory to handle that, by this point - they tend to pile up when you grind.
[5:34:01] <akitanito> that backstab did fuck all
[5:34:09] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt I know you can talk to Melina at some of these graces but I forget which ones
[5:34:19] <RyuuAoi> Oh yeah you ready
[5:34:19] <rudiciuscaesar> that sword beam thing also causes a knockdown
[5:34:38] <reasonance> these guys are surprisingly easy to stunlock R1 spam
[5:34:42] <%RealThiele> hole
[5:34:45] <%MaybeFalco> YEAAHH FLIPS
[5:35:05] <@QueequegTheater> Ultra greatswords will stunlock these guys on hit
[5:35:06] <%Cozy90> these guys are very parryable
[5:35:18] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> The special attack of your weapon will always knock them down
[5:35:36] <rudiciuscaesar> even more poo, even more rats
[5:35:51] <%justcallmebobplease> BOX RATS!
[5:35:51] <+SaintSalted> just tickle their nuts, causes instant posture break

[5:36:07] <%RealThiele> You don't have the rat. O, you don't have the rat.
[5:36:07] <Ner234> Good Ol' Box rat
[5:36:09] <rudiciuscaesar> That box rat was mailed here from The Depths
[5:36:12] <+extantCadence> But how did they get in there?
[5:36:17] <%Willowight> crate of rat
[5:36:19] <%radiorosewater> why is he in that box
[5:36:23] <%Fenrisulfr_V> The amount of dead bodies in this sewer is deeply concerning
[5:36:23] <domukujira> on the way to meet the holy dung man himself
[5:36:29] <%radiorosewater> how did he get in to the box
[5:36:29] <fishmonger555> hmm, wonder why they call him the Dungeater...
[5:36:33] <+Gale_Moonfrost> almost thought a new dino crisis was announced a few minuets ago
[5:36:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> idk it doesn't seem like it cares
[5:36:37] <rudiciuscaesar> do these flowers exist just to be damage sponges?
[5:36:45] <%radiorosewater> was the box built around the rat?
[5:36:46] <NewWillinium> Oh man things look so pretty when you set them on fire
[5:36:47] <akitanito> so many hp bloat
[5:36:47] <%Brassnarwhal> try fire
[5:36:50] <%RealThiele> these plants have too much HP
[5:36:57] <%justcallmebobplease> I legit love how for real they made someone with such a dumb name as 'Dungeater'.
[5:37:02] <NewWillinium> They REALLY upped their Fire Effects in this game godddamn
[5:37:02] <Twilightspfan> @fishmonger555 i want to say because he eats excrement but that seems too obvious.
[5:37:03] <%justcallmebobplease> Guy is super hardcore!

[5:39:27] <T_Sasquatch> Emotional suppprt dog to the rescue
[5:39:42] <%radiorosewater> necrophilia and feces inspired twitch chat
[5:39:44] <%Brassnarwhal> @justcallmebobplease siegmeyer is good fatman
[5:39:46] <%radiorosewater> hello?
[5:39:48] <%Puhff> ratJAM
[5:39:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> Spoil'd again by the Repugnant Fecus Feaster
[5:40:04] <%justcallmebobplease> @Brassnarwhal Siegmeyer is sadly not in Elden Ring... unless... WHAT DO YOU KNOW TELL ME NOW
[5:40:11] <%RealThiele> Alexander is nice enough for a vore enthusiast
[5:40:15] <+RadioactiveCanuck> bet this mans the dung eater literally had that sword up his butt
[5:40:28] <%Puhff> Oh yeah is Seigmeyer even in this one???
[5:40:47] <%Brassnarwhal> @justcallmebobplease they are turning over roles, giant blacksmith talks a lot instead of a little, shrine maiden is an active force not a passive one, fat man is an evil shitbag instead of a friend
[5:40:54] <domukujira> if alexander ate dungeater would he be a shit pot?
[5:41:05] <+RadioactiveCanuck> Alexander the Pot Man is like the Seig-friends
[5:41:19] <%Brassnarwhal> i agree Canuck
[5:41:20] <%RealThiele> Seig-vore friends
[5:41:20] <%Puhff> Alexander didnt seem jovial enough to be a Sieg imo
[5:41:39] <+thickshield> @domukujira A chamber pot if you will
[5:41:57] <%Brassnarwhal> @puhff he was pretty jobial but i agree not quite seig level really, more of a solaire type if you think about it
[5:42:21] <NewWillinium> I don't know if it's a bug or not, but I swear that there are quite a few bosses that recover a chunk of their health bars when they *shouldn't* be.
[5:42:51] <NewWillinium> There is a Siegfried Bro. But he's not *our* Bro.. He's Fia's.
[5:42:55] <%Brassnarwhal> @newwillinium I've only seen that in online play and i assumed it was a bit of lag
[5:43:13] <+RadioactiveCanuck> I notice that in Coop a lot, assumed it was lag.
[5:43:35] <NewWillinium> @Brassnarwhal I've had it happen a *lot* with bosses in the late late game playing solo. I have no idea what causes it to happen either.
[5:43:47] <+RadioactiveCanuck> Speaking of coop and bosses, I learned you can be invaded during the Radhan fight last night.
[5:43:50] <%Brassnarwhal> @newwillinium pc?
[5:43:58] <NewWillinium> PS4
[5:44:08] <%RealThiele> oh man Radahn co=op with no torrent would suck
[5:44:09] <domukujira> healing bosses arent fun :(
[5:44:13] <%Brassnarwhal> @radioactivecanuck that makes thematic sense it's a fighting festival
[5:44:16] <ReenBenkyou> @PatStaresAt Just want to say thanks for playing this game, I'm really enjoying having the stream on while studying Japanese. Please pet the babies!
[5:44:16] <%nip_nips> i havent had that, but i have had a lot of bosses not die on a hit that absolutely should've killed it
[5:44:27] <STORMWIZARD1> looks like barnacle boy got his revenge a pat lol @PatStaresAt

[5:45:37] <+RadioactiveCanuck> @RealThiele it was pretty bearable, except when you get invaded by invaders with Reduvia or Sword of Night and Flame
[5:45:42] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt this goes to progression

[5:46:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> brutal
[5:47:01] <@QueequegTheater> This is NewWillinium's fault
[5:47:02] <NewWillinium> Oh no, Talking about a Bug we would want to be patched @PatStaresAt . About some bosses randomely ragaining chunks of their lifebars
[5:47:06] <%tetraes> they mean patches the NPC
[5:47:07] <RyuuAoi> I think they just shooting the shit, Pat
[5:47:07] <%Puhff> GTG
[5:47:09] <%whyskeywolfe> f

[5:47:34] <%mai_waifu_> I THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY
[5:47:35] <STORMWIZARD1> Pat I give u a lot of crap but your Entertaining non the less good job bubba LUL
[5:47:37] <HeroToxiko> This boss is all too kooky
[5:47:37] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt there's a secret boss that due to this bug is almost impossible to beat without cheesing
[5:47:39] <%nip_nips> theres one boss that heals everytime it hits you, even blocking
[5:47:40] <%mai_waifu_> THEY DO COME BACK?
[5:47:44] <Sunstalker> The finger thing means TAXES
[5:47:50] <dante_must_die_exe> i put the flasks on the shortcut menu but i'm also a crazy person
[5:47:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> I hate that they're called Fingercreepers more than I hate their design
[5:47:53] <@QueequegTheater> @rosabellamelantha Which one?
[5:48:02] <%justcallmebobplease> @rosabellamelantha Don't tell me... Blade of M?
[5:48:04] <Saturation_Lizard> @PatStaresAt that boss lifebar stuff is NOT A BUG! it happens when you use tiche, the blade of death temporarily reduces maximum HP and gets restored when the timer runs out
[5:48:04] <NewWillinium> @dante_must_die_exe Yes. Yes you are
[5:48:06] <plaguedoctor_vi> @NewWillinium i fouth two bosses that did that, and i notice that, so it was a bug
[5:48:08] <+Edrem> you mean Malenia? I thought her entire gimmick was healing
[5:48:11] <$Jaxnos> pretty sure that's a function of that particular boss, not a bug.
[5:48:18] <%nip_nips> malenia is supposed to heal on hits
[5:48:20] <DracaenaLeaf> Dung Eater D:
[5:48:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> owned
[5:48:27] <rosabellamelantha> @rosabellamelantha The Blade yes, she does this a lot on top of her natural healing
[5:48:28] <RyuuAoi> That's cheap
[5:48:28] <DusK_The_Stray> He's gonna eat your dung
[5:48:29] <@QueequegTheater> THE TEAM UP
[5:48:29] <+acetothemax> An underground boss maybe
[5:48:33] <HeroToxiko> The hand threw it? LUL
[5:48:34] <CheeseBurgerHelper> Dung Eater has one hell of a battle cry
[5:48:35] <rudiciuscaesar> tables have turned hoomon
[5:48:35] <plaguedoctor_vi> Is that Secret boss the one from the Legacy dungeon from the land of the giants?
[5:48:35] <+RadioactiveCanuck> @Sunstalker "Why on earth did you attack the two fingers?!" >they tried to make me pay taxes. "Understandable."
[5:48:35] <oda_flobunaga> Regen is literally her mechanic
[5:48:37] <NewWillinium> @Edrem Oh yes, but it happens with other bosses too. Which is a bug. Especially when they don't have that mechanic to them
[5:48:40] <%tetraes> Thats not a bug lol thats how the boss works
[5:48:43] <sirrice77> oh is pat not doing dung eaters questline?
[5:48:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> fingercreeped
[5:48:44] <oda_flobunaga> She is the Bloodbourne lady
[5:48:47] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Guess who's gonna clear the mobs from now on after this Kappa
[5:48:49] <ALazo> shit boi coming through
[5:48:54] <HeroToxiko> He grows hands?
[5:49:02] <mekelwander> So the hands can "HOLD" you in place?
[5:49:02] <%cade_calrayn> Malenia's health regen is not a bug, it's a mechanic
[5:49:05] <RyuuAoi> BITCH
[5:49:07] <%luftraumm1> is his questline cool?
[5:49:08] <NewWillinium> It happens with other bosses too. That's the bug. Not that boss in particular
[5:49:09] <rosabellamelantha> @Edrem No she has her natural healing and ALSO procs that bug more than any other boss even if she DOESN'T HIT YOU
[5:49:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> there's poop in his flask
[5:49:20] <+wizard_of_diamonds> gg
[5:49:22] <RyuuAoi> Oh he's going
[5:49:23] <Alrom> He has one of the highest poises in the game. still gets staggered by every attack. poise is worthless :(
[5:49:27] <rudiciuscaesar> now he can eat shit in the afterlife
[5:49:29] <plaguedoctor_vi> @Edrem yes it hapend to the final boss for me today
[5:49:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> pat getting fingered to death
[5:49:32] <digaogrunge> In Oroboros last video he invades a player during Rennalas 2nd phase, this game has some buuuugs @PatStaresAt

[5:49:49] <sirrice77> @luftraumm1 his questline is to find curses from his victims and force them into his body. Also you find out he's super duper fucked up
[5:49:51] <@QueequegTheater> @Alrom Poise stops you from getting crumpled, not super armor in neutral

[5:51:48] <%radiorosewater> birds should follow
[5:51:51] <%nip_nips> bottom is a fuck
[5:51:59] <%RealThiele> toop= bad bottom=worse
[5:52:03] <%MartinOfLoxley> @Makouzer 1st playthrough
[5:52:04] <rudiciuscaesar> @XxMoliciousxX  it does look like an ultra shitty Mako reactor lmao
[5:52:06] <%furiousfurioso> getting close to the end, I think, on pc and now crashes are starting to become common
[5:52:08] <%justcallmebobplease> @NewWillinium Their origin comes up if you follow Dungeater's questline.  There are videos of it on youtube, even I think it'd be crazy lore spoilery so I'll not specifically say what they are.
[5:52:28] <rosabellamelantha> shortcut
[5:52:28] <%Brassnarwhal> why do people keep saying birds should follow what does that mean
[5:52:29] <+RadioactiveCanuck> my mans just decided to defenestrate himself
[5:52:34] <+Makouzer> @martinofloxley ty
[5:52:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> So how are Pat Adventures in the Woolie Hole goin?
[5:52:50] <ohno58> Those guys are tanky as fuck
[5:52:51] <rudiciuscaesar> the knockdown on that is so useful
[5:52:58] <+beansoup> Yoooo the range
[5:53:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> Jebaited
[5:53:04] <rekinom> For me the game has devolved into weapon art and miracle spamming and honestly I'm having a blast
[5:53:05] <+Makouzer> is that sword supposed to look like Skull knight's sword?
[5:53:08] <%MelBrooksKA> @RadioactiveCanuck There was no window tho
[5:53:11] <%tetraes> yeah dungeater quest has some lore to it but i dont think pat cares
[5:53:11] <%epide> PAT USE THAT IF ITS WHAT I THINK IT IS THE MIMIC CAN USE IT
[5:53:20] <TheSandmanIsHere> what about the poopslug pipe
[5:53:28] <%Brassnarwhal> that spell knows what you do in the dark
[5:53:36] <%epide> yeah its what i think it is
[5:53:37] <NewWillinium> So do you think the tiny hands on the swords are grabbing onto the veins and muscle fibers when it bites into flesh?
[5:53:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> i dont know if you've checked anytime recently but you can no longer call it the woolie hole, its a fancy nice looking place even Pat said he was jealous of lol @BallerSwagBro9k
[5:53:44] <reasonance> it's aural decoy
[5:53:47] <NewWillinium> Is that why it heals you?
[5:53:49] <%justcallmebobplease> @epide Holy fuck the aggro splitting.
[5:53:52] <%RealThiele> taunt mimic
[5:53:53] <%radiorosewater> @Brassnarwhal dumb running joke from the first stream, it just refers to mobs lacking mobility in weird ways. I've just been saying it to see if anyone would notice something so irrelevant. Thanks for coming to my TED takj
[5:53:55] <%Brassnarwhal> summon mimic and shadow clone
[5:53:56] <%radiorosewater> *talk

[5:54:22] <plaguedoctor_vi> they are imps the gargolys are the big boss ones
[5:54:22] <jacksawjack> there's a catacomb at the bottom of this shithole
[5:54:27] <XxMoliciousxX> these sewers look REALLY modern
[5:54:30] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt gotta go down the hole you fell in earlier it seems
[5:54:31] <%Brassnarwhal> @radiorosewater I've noticed it often enough that seing it triggered me like a sleeper agent
[5:54:31] <%JustToWatch> did Pat go back to the slug tunnel?
[5:54:38] <monkeyp0wer> Pat is that sword like the Firelink Sword for DS3? It kinda looked like it from the weapon skill.
[5:54:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> slughole?
[5:54:42] <+RedMaskBandit> u can take the Woolie out of the hole, but not the hole out of the Woolie.
[5:54:42] <$drabberfaun535> wait until he finds out he has to travel in the pipes

[5:59:24] <%radiorosewater> draw complex shapes with prism stones

[6:04:12] <$realm_forge> Yay old friends!
[6:04:24] <monkeyp0wer> If fire weapons made everything explode down here that would be hilarious.

[6:05:03] <digaogrunge> a baby
[6:05:04] <slackerunchained> "Bairn" is an old word that means 'child'/
[6:05:08] <%Brassnarwhal> elden ring is dark souls 1/3 in the streets and dark souls 2 in the sheets if you know what I'm saying
[6:05:10] <+imthinkingdarbys> it's a baby
[6:05:14] <%RealThiele> he ate a baby
[6:05:16] <rekinom> I like that hunter tools are back
[6:05:17] <%Kurgash> Kurgash subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! Happy 1.5 years and helping me cope with the pandemic early stages. Your play through has been super helpful in understanding the game but made me realize going str/endurance/vigor leaves little room for spells. Probably should fix that.
[6:05:18] <jacksawjack> Horny baby
[6:05:21] <@QueequegTheater> FeelsBadMan
[6:05:26] <%JGardner03> That item kinda made me a little sad with the last line
[6:05:33] <%Cigwynn> It's the counter to the one you can get from Margot!
[6:05:40] <$Jaxnos> that shit waterfall should've given you scarlet rot.
[6:05:44] <%Brassnarwhal> more twinkle
[6:05:47] <Purpleleven> oh look, broken glass for you to crawl thru in the sewer
[6:05:57] <Ravioli_Ronin> I think it’s great that GRRM just wrote Dung Eater, and had nothing else to do with the game

[6:06:59] <%ahdurian> you didnt kill me!
[6:06:59] <digaogrunge> prawns
[6:06:59] <Augus7717> hurray lobster
[6:07:03] <stormhawk9891> You sure showed 'em
[6:07:04] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You were saying about Dung Eater
[6:07:05] <%Brassnarwhal> all according to kekaku
[6:07:20] <%barrakuta371> You didn't win - Pat, since time imemorial
[6:07:24] <%RealThiele> dats why i like the twiggy flask
[6:07:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah totally
[6:07:34] <Baeltyr> does he though
[6:07:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> very normal guy
[6:07:37] <it_came_from_outer_space> totally normal
[6:07:37] <TheSandmanIsHere> "seems"
[6:07:37] <Ghufufin> frenzied you would say?
[6:07:38] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt the one you meet in round table is definitely not mentally "stable"
[6:07:40] <oda_flobunaga> They are not actually lobsters.  They are giant crayfish.  You can tell if you look at the claws.
[6:07:40] <HeroToxiko> he sounded tired
[6:07:42] <%radiorosewater> uhhhh
[6:07:42] <%furiousfurioso> well, does he though
[6:07:43] <Augus7717> well roundtable version is dead now so yeah
[6:07:44] <slackerunchained> Boc is a goblin but he's a lot more well-spoken than most other goblins you meet.
[6:07:45] <stormhawk9891> For a given value of "normal"
[6:07:47] <TheSandmanIsHere> is doing a lot of work in that sentence
[6:07:47] <%soloshotfirst82> dude's called "Dung Eater".  Not sure how "mentally stable" you can be with that name.
[6:07:49] <$Jaxnos> which is fun because he's clearly an invasion boy at the roundtable
[6:07:50] <+Edrem> if you actually talk to him in sewers he doesn't even recognize you
[6:07:50] <+TheBitingIrish> 'Mentally stable'
[6:07:50] <+handfulofslugs> Souls NPC normal
[6:07:51] <signofzeta> more composed
[6:07:54] <sirrice77> i wouldn't say mentally stable but you can like have a conversation
[6:07:57] <%JustToWatch> this real one doesn't recognize you if you talk
[6:07:59] <@QueequegTheater> He seems cogent
[6:08:03] <%Brassnarwhal> i don't think mentally stable people swear to defile other peoples corpses
[6:08:07] <TheBlankAce> There is the non aggression thing at the round table so that could be part of it
[6:08:18] <%furiousfurioso> there's more clarity to his loathsomeness in the roundtable
[6:08:19] <%Agami23> you can have a conversation with the one in the hold. the one here is truly crazed
[6:08:21] <samuelfisk> @PatStaresAt I think he was willing to talk only because he couldn’t kill you there
[6:08:28] <%RealThiele> TMNT
[6:08:31] <NewWillinium> We have been attacked at the Round-Table before
[6:08:36] <NewWillinium> Twice even
[6:08:36] <it_came_from_outer_space> perhaps the dung eater finally got sick of eating dung
[6:08:39] <%Deft_Thought> You mean the guy who said, "You're lucky we're here at the roundtable otherwise I'd kill you and defile your corpse." wasn't crazed?
[6:08:40] <jubejube56> Funnily enough I’ve seen similar behaviour in other characters besides dung eater
[6:08:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> he literally says that doesn't he?
[6:08:42] <slackerunchained> You can actually get the heads of the imps as rare drops. They boost stats.
[6:08:49] <$Jaxnos> there are ways around the non-agression pact though. that we've seen.
[6:08:55] <Sunstalker> Maybe in his spirit form he also doesn't feel his own fucked up body as much
[6:08:56] <%Brassnarwhal> he actually says the only reason he doesn't kill you there is cause he can't
[6:08:59] <jubejube56> Surprisingly enough being a soul seems to let you be “calmer” than your physical swlf
[6:09:12] <%Deft_Thought> BIG RAT
[6:09:12] <sirrice77> if you do his quest he has very strange lines where he tries to reason about why he was unable to kill you when you repel his invasion
[6:09:18] <%radiorosewater> big rat
[6:09:25] <@QueequegTheater> That rat is stronger than Godrick
[6:09:26] <%RealThiele> rune rat
[6:09:27] <%radiorosewater> he makes the rules
[6:09:32] <slackerunchained> @jubejube56 Less glands acting out on you, I guess.
[6:09:43] <$Jaxnos> don't wanna scrape the poop?
[6:09:46] <it_came_from_outer_space> not gonna scrape all the shit?
[6:09:51] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt You are going to want to though
[6:09:51] <rekinom> Do it pussynoballs
[6:09:53] <@QueequegTheater> scrape da pupu
[6:09:56] <+handfulofslugs> Scrape the poop pipes Pat
[6:09:56] <%nip_nips> scrape allllll the poopoo
[6:09:57] <%Brassnarwhal> not scraping the shit pat?
[6:09:57] <%Cigwynn> Scrape the poop
[6:10:00] <%JonathLP> Scrape the sides to get the good goo
[6:10:01] <%Deft_Thought> Scrape the dung
[6:10:02] <%livi242> I'd at least go to where the lobsters are
[6:10:05] <plaguedoctor_vi> oh wow Pat found the corret path right away
[6:10:06] <$bcdenton> this place has 2 boss fights and an ending unlock
[6:10:09] <Midnight188> scrape up all the poopoo
[6:10:10] <Ghufufin> the map would prob look like pick up sticks
[6:10:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> scrape every molecule of detritus from the walls
[6:10:11] <insomniac_doze_> PotFriend
[6:10:12] <NewWillinium> You're actually at the big reason why right here.
[6:10:13] <%luftraumm1> iirc rubberfistfight said something about lobsters and going deep
[6:10:15] <slackerunchained> OH NOES Alexander has gone HOLLOW!
[6:10:16] <%tetraes> guys its ok if he misses shit
[6:10:17] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt secret bosses/ ending shenanigans
[6:10:20] <Ethel9727> Joke's on you Pat, this is an area you basically have to scrape
[6:10:20] <%Brassnarwhal> psa1guy psa1guy
[6:10:20] <genmypoweralready> Dos Boss Fighto
[6:10:20] <%radiorosewater> It has stuff that's good for your build
[6:10:22] <$realm_forge> You can’t get all the shit if you don’t scrape the sewer
[6:10:30] <%nip_nips> pat doesnt want the poop ending?
[6:10:32] <huskarl_zap> JAR GANG PotFriend
[6:10:34] <sweatch0> poop ending
[6:10:34] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt talk to melina at these graces
[6:10:35] <Estwilde> scrape it clean
[6:10:45] <@QueequegTheater> You already broke the Poop ending
[6:10:46] <$Jaxnos> that looks like one of them there hero graves
[6:10:49] <oda_flobunaga> Yes
[6:10:49] <%SveriSageAdvice> yes
[6:10:50] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> yes
[6:10:50] <%Deft_Thought> PotFriend
[6:10:51] <%imthewisejanitor> "Noooo, you have to do everything!!"
[6:10:53] <plaguedoctor_vi> in front of you
[6:10:54] <$bcdenton> very bottom of the big staircase
[6:10:54] <%MaybeFalco> yes
[6:10:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> Usher in an Age of Feces
[6:10:57] <huskarl_zap> never been here
[6:10:59] <slackerunchained> I am so shocked - *SHOCKED* - that this sewer isn't more-poisonous.
[6:10:59] <RubberFistFight> fuck yeah you found it
[6:11:00] <%livi242> there's a catacomb with the lobsters
[6:11:06] <%MartinOfLoxley> PotFriend PotFriend
[6:11:07] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt well you can back out of the ending actually if you want it explained to you, though you can also just go right up the point of no return for it and just not go through
[6:11:14] <plaguedoctor_vi> go to the lobsters
[6:11:22] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt yah, if you went through the teeny tiny hole in the wall
[6:11:33] <+RedMaskBandit> 2
[6:11:41] <%cade_calrayn> that's the Frenzied Flame ending, it's separate from the Dung Eater ending
[6:11:44] <%radiorosewater> 3
[6:11:49] <TheSandmanIsHere> only true ending is simping for Ranni
[6:11:53] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt keep dropping onto lower pipes
[6:11:59] <Midnight188> so poop man is ded so that path is closed and icky evil red murder peole in volcano manor are dead so that ending is closed.
[6:12:04] <%livi242> back in the main room
[6:12:05] <slackerunchained> Man. Between the gigantic crabs and gigantic lobsters, the people of Elden Ring must eat pretty well. ...I think they might only suffer from a lack of butter. :\
[6:12:12] <%RealThiele> no
[6:12:13] <@QueequegTheater> Lobsters are in the main pipe room
[6:12:14] <+KazairLux> Why does the fight music here sound so much like Silent Hill music
[6:12:18] <huskarl_zap> Omen'd
[6:12:19] <$Jaxnos> i want that wraith body explosion
[6:12:35] <+Shin_Doom_Bot> Question; what does the Blood Rot do?
[6:12:35] <+FlappySeal_> the pipes room with the imps is the lobster room. Gotta make your way down
[6:12:37] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt even with the unalloyed thing you miss out on some dialogue and cutscenes if you go for chaos flame
[6:12:38] <%radiorosewater> i didn't have enough milk for my cereal
[6:12:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> @slackerunchained the rolling sheep make great butter
[6:12:45] <+Honjudd> Is he using the TOGETHAAAA sword?
[6:12:49] <%Deft_Thought> Headin' to bed. Have a good night, folks
[6:12:55] <@QueequegTheater> You gotta parkour down
[6:12:57] <domukujira> its an item that explosion i think
[6:13:00] <%RealThiele> beneath all the imp
[6:13:01] <%JoshManVGH> Lobsters are evil
[6:13:04] <%Deft_Thought> Thanks for streaming, @PatStaresAt. Have a good night
[6:13:05] <+extantCadence> They're not lobsters, they're crayfish
[6:13:05] <%radiorosewater> @Deft_Thought likewise funny guy
[6:13:05] <@QueequegTheater> You can
[6:13:07] <%Felhad> Lol, damn, I left the stream like 3.5 hours ago and we're still in the sewers?
[6:13:07] <domukujira> uses fp
[6:13:08] <huskarl_zap> omens cast holy black flame?
[6:13:09] <%nip_nips> you can get all the way down from inside the room
[6:13:13] <plaguedoctor_vi> there a low pipe that you can drop to the lobsters
[6:13:34] <+Grayhammatter> lobstars
[6:13:38] <+RedMaskBandit> damn union lobsters
[6:13:41] <%nip_nips> lobstors
[6:13:44] <RyuuAoi> Fuck those gremlins
[6:13:51] <%RealThiele> gotta go back then
[6:13:53] <slackerunchained> pat should totally farm an imp-head and wear it.
[6:13:59] <Sunstalker> The lobstars? Are they the bad guys in Space Jam 2?
[6:14:03] <%bruuzer12> Lobtier
[6:14:04] <+Makouzer> I find radagon seals to be really bad at later levels
[6:14:07] <$realm_forge> Lob stars was an unsuccessful street sharks spin off
[6:14:08] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Back the other way
[6:14:08] <%nip_nips> HONK
[6:14:16] <domukujira> just gotta drop
[6:14:19] <RyuuAoi> @sunstalker Basically
[6:14:25] <%RealThiele> LUL
[6:14:27] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt you have to drop down
[6:14:46] <slackerunchained> That loading screen reminds me of the cover-art of the game 'Godbound'.
[6:14:55] <ohno58> Just hard coded to drop lol
[6:14:59] <$drabberfaun535> i hate how they decided to make everything after the 80% mark do 200% more damage
[6:15:07] <%tsuchi7> maybe its because of how confusing the sewers are, but I legit think the undercity is bigger than the actual city itself
[6:15:27] <%RealThiele> Snipars
[6:15:29] <RyuuAoi> @drabberfaun535 That's a Bloodborne
[6:15:39] <%nip_nips> beware of pincer attack
[6:15:41] <$Jaxnos> lobstered
[6:15:41] <ohno58> Its not that big an area, its just complicated
[6:15:43] <+SergeantFlare> bro that lobster just faked you out
[6:15:43] <+Makouzer> @drabberfaun535 really forces you to use a certain amulet honestly

[6:18:53] <Purpleleven> The snail was ghosts all along
[6:18:57] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt path forward is through those catacombs
[6:18:58] <Sunstalker> I want Fromsoft to make one of these levers jjust kill the player. Just once.
[6:18:58] <lethallylactic> Most pointless shortcut of all time
[6:19:08] <Sigma_190_Beta> Wow, people are trying to spoil hard.
[6:19:09] <%nip_nips> praise the shortcut
[6:19:13] <%cade_calrayn> isn't it back to that road?
[6:19:20] <+Grayhammatter> ah fuck no

[6:19:50] <oda_flobunaga> its not the MOST annoying, but its up there
[6:19:55] <%Willowight> do people usually link up catacombs to sewers?
[6:20:02] <%imthewisejanitor> For SPOOPIES
[6:20:06] <NewWillinium> Just once in a Fantasy game I would love to see a set of Sewers that were well kept, and as clean as all possible?
[6:20:09] <Estwilde> "shunning ground"
[6:20:10] <+Shin_Doom_Bot> Great they are on fire now
[6:20:16] <Estwilde> This is like a prison I guess?
[6:20:19] <Purpleleven> They sure have done a fantastic job of making you feel how smelly these areas are, in more ways than one
[6:20:34] <athuramn> there was one I spent maybe 30 minutes to solve and when I did, I didn't realize what I did to solve it
[6:20:44] <%nip_nips> if you're touching the pillar while you jump onto it, that activates it at the same time

[6:24:35] <%justcallmebobplease> Imagine if DLC is literally just 'go back in time to the Shattering Era map and states for assorted characters to be in'.  Can you say, peak Radahn with his wits still about him?
[6:24:52] <%justcallmebobplease> It's not like the DLC being 'just go back in time' is without precedent for these games, so I'm hoping.
[6:24:55] <jubejube56> I guess they already beat this dungeon themselves and just live here?
[6:24:59] <%justcallmebobplease> I want the Shattering era so much.

[6:27:38] <%Brassnarwhal> why is the game gaslighting pat
[6:27:39] <42nfl19> Maybe its one of those non eucldian rooms, Like that one painting
[6:27:40] <Purpleleven> Are the sewage fumes getting to Tarnished's head or something

[6:32:23] <Sunstalker> He dresses better then his brother
[6:32:33] <%Valdorick> @Valdorick Nope, Mohg, The Omen, and Mohg Lord of Blood
[6:32:34] <+flychosis> POCKET SAND
[6:32:35] <RubberFistFight> @cade_calrayn mohgwyn?

[6:32:38] <%luftraumm1> throw rock at satan
[6:32:38] <RubberFistFight> You never fight him
[6:32:46] <%cade_calrayn> @QueequegTheater I got both on my first try with the Kamehameha
[6:32:52] <NewWillinium> And I think that's it for the Sewers right?
[6:32:53] <%Agami23> bloodflame is so busted
[6:32:53] <TheSandmanIsHere> so how did Pat like the real Mohg fight's gimmick?
[6:32:53] <slackerunchained> Both Fire AND Blood. :)
[6:32:55] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Weird request. Remove all your gear and approach the altar.
[6:32:55] <%RealThiele> Satan hates rocks
[6:32:56] <%justcallmebobplease> Please be a teleport trap
[6:32:58] <ape_hawk> Rock types are strong against fire types
[6:32:58] <%shootbang_exe> smack the altar
[6:32:59] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt melina
[6:32:59] <Boombay1213> EASY
[6:33:00] <%Valdorick> Morgit and Moggit is a case of the King of Lendel not using his real name outside the city.
[6:33:00] <+acetothemax> Nope
[6:33:01] <%Puhff> mama mia
[6:33:04] <RubberFistFight> Mohgwyn is the name of the palace - you fight the beefier version of him there @cade_calrayn
[6:33:05] <%justcallmebobplease> I'm begging you game, make that a fuckoff stupid trap chest
[6:33:05] <%livi242> check behind that chest :3

[6:33:13] <rosabellamelantha> you could talk to melina here @PatStaresAt
[6:33:14] <%cade_calrayn> @RubberFistFight oh Mohg, lol, I get him and his dynasty mixed up
[6:33:16] <+LandOfTheWay> @cade_calrayn i mean, being an Omen is more of a birth defect than a different species, so in that sense he's the same as the other demigods
[6:33:16] <+Honjudd> Hit altar
[6:33:25] <+acetothemax> Wall
[6:33:27] <@QueequegTheater> FAP 2

[6:34:31] <zhenthrim213> DONT END EVERTHING, please
[6:34:33] <CheeseBurgerHelper> Oh so THIS is the point of all that frenzy stuff
[6:34:34] <@QueequegTheater> I can't believe I missed this next part
[6:34:39] <%cade_calrayn> Stop here if you don't want to do the Frenzied Flame ending, Pat, I think
[6:34:40] <slackerunchained> @PatStaresAt Please don't turn into a tree and create a whole bunch of demons, Pat. :\
[6:34:45] <%RealThiele> altar is secret? oops missed that
[6:34:56] <%cade_calrayn> or at least stop before you finish the next section
[6:34:56] <+Honjudd> HIt the altar elaREE
[6:35:04] <%Cigwynn> Regal
[6:35:05] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @QueequegTheater There's nothing in-game that tells you to do the next part, as far as I know.
[6:35:06] <+lord_sykos> @Estwilde I thought the exact same thing. So similar
[6:35:08] <%Valdorick> THAT'S GOOD ARMOR
[6:35:09] <oda_flobunaga> @cade_calrayn he can go down as long as he doesn't enter THE door
[6:35:10] <plaguedoctor_vi> looking cool pat
[6:35:11] <%nip_nips> you can still back out of the frenzy flame even after you do the thing
[6:35:11] <%cade_calrayn> yeah the Crucible set is GREAT
[6:35:19] <%Agami23> you look like a god damn warhammer 40k marine
[6:35:19] <%Fenrisulfr_V> People figured it out from a promo image before the game came out.
[6:35:19] <%radiorosewater> sexy
[6:35:21] <morkelebmink> ya'll just can't help it can you, let Pat figure out stuff on his own XD
[6:35:21] <%justcallmebobplease> There were more 'Talk to Melina' prompts, were there not?  At the Grace?
[6:35:22] <rosabellamelantha> no
[6:35:25] <%nip_nips> no hit the altar
[6:35:26] <%DEETRz> hit altar
[6:35:26] <rosabellamelantha> that's for later
[6:35:27] <$bcdenton> hit it

[6:35:45] <%Mathochism> DON'T DO DO THIS
[6:35:45] <lethallylactic> monkaS
[6:35:45] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt don't go naked unless you want to get LOCKED into frenzy flame
[6:35:50] <%nip_nips> if you do the naked thing later, you'll be locked into an ending unless you do some sidequest stuff
[6:35:51] <Adamisfruit> Hit it
[6:35:51] <%abakkus> i heard something about a naked door being an auto ending i thought
[6:35:52] <%MartinOfLoxley> Chat wanted to see dat butt again
[6:35:52] <%furiousfurioso> that will lock you in I think
[6:35:53] <%MaybeFalco> dont do anything more if you want to stay away from the frenzied flame shit
[6:35:54] <+Honjudd> Whot tf said naked chat elaHmm elaHmm
[6:35:55] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Just don't open THE DOOR at the bottom.
[6:35:56] <oda_flobunaga> naked not necessary
[6:35:57] <%justcallmebobplease> You need to be naked for the NEXT door... if you want.
[6:35:58] <sirrice77> Guys the altar is fine, it's the door that's the issue
[6:35:59] <RubberFistFight> @bruuzer12 shut up, dude, he's not at that part yet
[6:36:00] <RubberFistFight> christ
[6:36:04] <domukujira> not locked
[6:36:05] <@QueequegTheater> Why would going naked lock you in
[6:36:08] <@QueequegTheater> That's extremely silly
[6:36:08] <+LandOfTheWay> relax people, he can back out if he does millicent's quest
[6:36:09] <$realm_forge> BECOME THE ELDEN NUDE
[6:36:11] <TwistParabola> it'll soft-lock him into it, unless he finishes millicent's quest
[6:36:17] <mr_dream__> its literally just a cutscene chat relax
[6:36:21] <rosabellamelantha> EVIL
[6:36:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh
[6:36:21] <RubberFistFight> how about the people who haven't played this and only half-read badly written walkthroughs shut the fuck up.
[6:36:22] <dinnydanny777> 🎻
[6:36:22] <%justcallmebobplease> WELP
[6:36:24] <slackerunchained> It's fiiiiiiiine...
[6:36:26] <zhenthrim213> well then
[6:36:26] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @QueequegTheater Being naked is what lets you open THE DOOR
[6:36:27] <oda_flobunaga> He can reach the bottom its Fine chat.  At the bottom he can leave without doing it
[6:36:29] <TwistParabola> eeeeeevil
[6:36:30] <+flychosis> PoroSad

[6:36:49] <+flychosis> imperialSweat
[6:36:55] <%Willowight> foreboding
[6:36:56] <+flychosis> many many men
[6:36:59] <plaguedoctor_vi> @abakkus it the only Ending that lock you on it, and don´t let you chose, you can undo but it need a quest
[6:37:01] <+SodiumPatrol> dnoWHAT
[6:37:02] <sirrice77> Yes he can reach the bottom and just leave it's fine
[6:37:05] <TwistParabola> try lock-on
[6:37:07] <%Felhad> They're all merchants
[6:37:08] <%Cigwynn> idk, they seem to be having a good time
[6:37:09] <%luftraumm1> are these merchants?
[6:37:13] <+LandOfTheWay> what too much madness does to a mf
[6:37:15] <NewWillinium> Soooo. . . Lore guessing here. Did all of these people seek the Frenzied Flame and . . . burn out I guess?
[6:37:24] <%ithonmage> some party
[6:37:25] <+flychosis> many many men...
[6:37:25] <RubberFistFight> @plaguedoctor_vi it's not even that difficult to take the exit option from this, especially given how OP pat is.
[6:37:27] <+flychosis> wish death upon me
[6:37:32] <%MaybeFalco> so many corpses, christ
[6:37:32] <Zebroneath> fyi, there are items in the tents, but you need the enemies to destroy them
[6:37:34] <RubberFistFight> I'm literally fighting the boss for that quest right the fuck now.
[6:37:37] <slackerunchained> "This is not a place of Honor."
[6:37:39] <%nip_nips> you're SO far beneath the city now
[6:37:45] <NewWillinium> And the Frenzied Flame is different from the Flame of Ruin.
[6:37:54] <CheeseBurgerHelper> This place does seem pretty evil
[6:37:56] <+Edrem> the bloodstains LUL
[6:37:57] <NewWillinium> I think
[6:38:00] <CheeseBurgerHelper> Makes sense they buried it so deep
[6:38:02] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Shit's fucked, yo
[6:38:05] <+Honjudd> Put yo dick on the frenzied flame elaYEP
[6:38:07] <+MarkoTolstov> what dungeon is this under? i think i did it but didnt realize there was more
[6:38:07] <+LandOfTheWay> well he seems to be doing okay
[6:38:07] <plaguedoctor_vi> @RubberFistFight yes not saying it is, just explaning to someone that asked
[6:38:08] <TwistParabola> Yeah
[6:38:10] <Sunstalker> WHAT A BBITCH OF A LEVEL
[6:38:13] <%cade_calrayn> I saw this and said fuck no I'm out
[6:38:13] <%justcallmebobplease> They're ALL holding instruments - were they playing a dirge to the Frenzied Flame or something?
[6:38:14] <dinnydanny777> Keep going down and you might reach it :)
[6:38:15] <%tsuchi7> i got stuck here for almot an hour lmao
[6:38:15] <%Valdorick> Parkour
[6:38:17] <Estwilde> lmao
[6:38:18] <VelkHarone> hardest part of the game right here
[6:38:20] <%cade_calrayn> HOW
[6:38:23] <%nip_nips> nice
[6:38:24] <Estwilde> THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLE
[6:38:25] <%notsoy> man what the fuck
[6:38:26] <TwistParabola> F
[6:38:26] <+SodiumPatrol> gg
[6:38:26] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[6:38:27] <KingKZ> nliFELL
[6:38:27] <%MaybeFalco> LUL
[6:38:28] <%abakkus> @abakkus ahh ok. someone else i watch was complaining about opening a door naked and the game just ending right There; guess that was hyperbole a bit from the sound of it
[6:38:29] <+wizard_of_diamonds> This reminds me of jumping down to get the Firekeeper's set in DS3
[6:38:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> this music is excellent
[6:38:30] <RubberFistFight> yes. yes it is.
[6:38:30] <TheSandmanIsHere> LUL
[6:38:32] <%cade_calrayn> It's not worth it
[6:38:32] <oda_flobunaga> That there's a DS2
[6:38:34] <%Valdorick> You were cool until you weren't
[6:38:34] <RubberFistFight> it's real butthole clenching
[6:38:34] <TwistParabola> i died here more than most bosses
[6:38:35] <%soloshotfirst82> It's not the drop but the sudden stop at the end.
[6:38:36] <+possumwalsh1221> Platforming Clap
[6:38:38] <NewWillinium> The Nomad Spirit Ash DOES use Frenzied Flame spells.
[6:38:39] <%notsoy> they need to put a shrine before that part
[6:38:40] <Ethel9727> But Pat dug too greedily and too deep
[6:38:40] <TheSandmanIsHere> behold, gravity!
[6:38:42] <@QueequegTheater> That's a big DS2
[6:38:44] <$drabberfaun535> even dung eater thought this stuff sucked
[6:38:46] <+handfulofslugs> They gave you a good jump. They expect you to use it.
[6:38:49] <RubberFistFight> @abakkus massive fucking hyperbole.
[6:38:51] <mr_dream__> now we're talkikng
[6:38:52] <sweatch0> man i wish music wouldnt overlap in these moments
[6:38:53] <TheHatch10> Can you show where you are on the map please?
[6:38:59] <Sunstalker> The death shaft is the bit in each of fromsofts games that I hate the most.
[6:38:59] <%Maids4lyfe> that's kind of the point
[6:39:00] <domukujira> this is like majula pit
[6:39:06] <genmypoweralready> Accelerationist Pat sweats
[6:39:07] <%shootbang_exe> mulligan
[6:39:12] <%Valdorick> Is that do-over... from the Frenzied Flame, Pat?
[6:39:13] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt and that's why Ranni is best girl
[6:39:14] <XxMoliciousxX> what society? everyone's dead
[6:39:15] <%cade_calrayn> @TheHatch10 very very deep under the capital
[6:39:17] <+godzookylives> @PatStaresAt Are you talking about the game or real life?
[6:39:17] <slackerunchained> "We live in a society... but we shouldn't." :)
[6:39:20] <%notsoy> WHATTTT
[6:39:22] <ExpressNode> Look at this tight Mario platforming
[6:39:22] <+RedMaskBandit> Platforming, the true final boss.
[6:39:23] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Who could've guessed that worshipping aliens its a bad thing
[6:39:23] <GrenYena> where is this catacomb at?
[6:39:24] <%JoshManVGH> Needs a Life/Death cycle
[6:39:25] <CheeseBurgerHelper> We need a change of leadership in the Lands between
[6:39:25] <$realm_forge> Agreed. Oh wait you’re talking about the game
[6:39:28] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Sunstalker It's my 2nd least favorite after the invisible platforming shit.
[6:39:28] <plaguedoctor_vi> @RubberFistFight to be fair tho i did this and could pick up the cure, and becouse of that did not see Melinda quest being finished
[6:39:29] <%chiefedjustice> chiefedjustice subscribed with Prime. 
[6:39:29] <Estwilde> The violinist is a nice touch
[6:39:30] <%cade_calrayn> it's not worth it Pat
[6:39:32] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt if the grape quest hadn't bugged out on you, grape girl would be waiting down here and would explain a bit of what team frenzy flame's motives are
[6:39:33] <+acetothemax> Easier to do it naked
[6:39:33] <rosabellamelantha> you need to running jump some of these
[6:39:34] <%cade_calrayn> just walk away
[6:39:37] <%discoinfierno> Ironic much this games shares in design and story with Hollow Knight
[6:39:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> Souls games have always been platformers
[6:39:43] <+RedMaskBandit> Which one?
[6:39:44] <Purpleleven> PLATFORMING
[6:39:44] <Midnight188> "we buried this awful thing on purpose, do not touch" and then the Tarnished did it anyways because LAMO
[6:39:46] <TheSandmanIsHere> try gravity
[6:39:51] <Zebroneath> the final shot
[6:39:54] <%Willowight> fun
[6:39:56] <TheHatch10> Ohh never found this thanks
[6:39:56] <+Dosp5> Dont you have a talisman that negates fall damage?
[6:39:56] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Is there a Cat Rinq equivalent in this game?
[6:39:59] <digaogrunge> PAIN
[6:40:01] <NewWillinium> *Laughs*  Vere! Come and fight us!
[6:40:04] <ohno58> I bet you she'll be there
[6:40:05] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt its totally worth it there is some cool shit and map interconnections
[6:40:05] <%BonewheelVanguard> I like how this process of getting to the thing is showing how fucked the choice of ending is.
[6:40:07] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight he's already done millicent's quest far enough that it should complete
[6:40:13] <sweatch0> you gave her moldy grapes
[6:40:13] <$realm_forge> Patforming
[6:40:13] <Zebroneath> nope
[6:40:15] <slackerunchained> @42nfl19 There is!
[6:40:16] <RubberFistFight> and there's enough people here to let him know if he's about to go too far.
[6:40:17] <%X2Eliah> naw
[6:40:19] <Saturation_Lizard> @42nfl19 yes but it doesn't stop fatal damage and is thus somewhat worthless
[6:40:20] <%Agami23> there is a cat ring, but it wont help with instant death
[6:40:21] <Midnight188> Vyke you bitch!
[6:40:22] <%X2Eliah> too late by now
[6:40:24] <Sunstalker> @42nfl19 There is but it doesn't help against lethal drops
[6:40:25] <Khester824> vyke is at the frenzy flame village grace
[6:40:25] <CheeseBurgerHelper> Hang on the grape thing can bug on you?
[6:40:26] <@QueequegTheater> F
[6:40:26] <%Valdorick> You kept talking about the Three Fingers at the start of this playthrough... does this mean Frenzied Flame was your goal ending before this bug?
[6:40:26] <%Felhad> it negates fall damage, but doesnt prevent instant fall death
[6:40:30] <%X2Eliah> madness
[6:40:30] <morkelebmink> Omnicide
[6:40:31] <Saturation_Lizard> chaos

[6:40:40] <martymcsigh> subversion of the greater will
[6:40:40] <JoshyJay> LMAO
[6:40:40] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt yeah that quest is permafucked for a lot of people. It's alright, it's only a little bit of flavour afaik, nothing crucial to the questline.
[6:40:40] <Sigma_190_Beta> Omnicide to all.
[6:40:40] <morkelebmink> Team frenzy's motives are 'omnicide' burn it all
[6:40:41] <HeroToxiko> Surt
[6:40:41] <Midnight188> kill everything
[6:40:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> @42nfl19 There is, but you can still only fall so far before you die
[6:40:42] <+Kyma1020> Chaos
[6:40:42] <MartyFun11> The motive is 'fuck everything forever'
[6:40:43] <%AgniBrandt> At that church, rather
[6:40:43] <+possumwalsh1221> CHAOS
[6:40:44] <%JoshManVGH> C H A O S
[6:40:45] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> CHAOS
[6:40:45] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt Hyetta would explaoin more but it's basically kill EVERYTHING and everyone including the gods
[6:40:45] <CheeseBurgerHelper> I assume team Frenzy is on the destroy the universe kick
[6:40:46] <WillSin4Cash> LINK THE FIRE
[6:40:47] <%bevyrage> they're the joker baybee
[6:40:48] <Ner234> lol lmao
[6:40:48] <Sunstalker> Fuck them all
[6:40:48] <lockoo404> forever
[6:40:49] <Ethel9727> "World is a fuck, burn it down and maybe the next one will be better."
[6:40:50] <genmypoweralready> Everyone dies but it's funny
[6:40:50] <ohno58> EEEEEEEEEDGE
[6:40:50] <%pabloelenano2> what does a bunch of crazy psychos you think would like?
[6:40:50] <@QueequegTheater> Burn it
[6:40:51] <%ForlornCarton> Fire forever
[6:40:51] <%Valdorick> Did you ever play Soul Nomad and the World Eater's Demon path?
[6:40:52] <%Puhff> Fuck it all to death
[6:40:52] <%justcallmebobplease> They MEAN IT when they say 'burn it'.
[6:40:54] <%Valdorick> That's thier end game.
[6:40:54] <penitentpendant> "Everything Burns" The Faction
[6:40:55] <plaguedoctor_vi> @RubberFistFight he did the legacy dungeon in the lands of the giant?
[6:40:57] <count1999> its the bad end
[6:40:58] <%sporeian94> Melina will no longer be your girlfriend
[6:40:59] <$bcdenton> annihilation of all everything forever
[6:40:59] <%Puhff> Burn FOrever
[6:41:00] <jubejube56> Fire, burn
[6:41:01] <CheeseBurgerHelper> It sure does!
[6:41:01] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt basically, the frenzied flame thinks disparity in existence is bad, so it all needs to be melted into a single whole
[6:41:03] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Frenzy: Burn everything FOREVER
[6:41:04] <genmypoweralready> No it's fine everyone dies therefore nobody suffers
[6:41:05] <%captain_thickthighs> girls love arson
[6:41:08] <Sunstalker> It's almost as if they're MAD
[6:41:09] <+lord_sykos> It is
[6:41:09] <TheSandmanIsHere> Frenzy is the "worse than Dung Eater" ending
[6:41:10] <%Puhff> No regrowth
[6:41:10] <+possumwalsh1221> Burn it real good lord all the time always burn it
[6:41:10] <%luftraumm1> not much SIGHT in it at all baybee
[6:41:11] <%ElkRiverDog> Burn it down and then burn the ashes
[6:41:14] <%Puhff> Yeah they're insane
[6:41:17] <+SaintSalted> very short sited but cool
[6:41:18] <lockoo404> they don't have eyes anymore
[6:41:18] <+croutonian> short SIGHTED?
[6:41:19] <slackerunchained> Step 1: Turn into bugs/trees, make demons, and burn the world. / Step 2: ????? / Step 3: Profit.
[6:41:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> I feel like they know exactly what they want
[6:41:20] <Khester824> THAT WASN'T WHERE HE INVADES
[6:41:26] <jman13131313> Big bad end
[6:41:27] <lockoo404> their eyeballs burned out
[6:41:29] <%livi242> human instrumentality?
[6:41:35] <%Valdorick> RIP that phantom
[6:41:37] <BenLaaNN> how do you unlock the seal to this area?
[6:41:37] <%captain_thickthighs> @LandOfTheWay so the evagelion horrible plan
[6:41:37] <tolloponik> More POWER PowerUpL
[6:41:38] <%JoshManVGH> Bring about the Age of Fire, I guess. Maybe Shabriri is the Fertive Pygmy.
[6:41:39] <CheeseBurgerHelper> Super evil, but you gotta admit the incantations you get that deal with frenzy are awesome
[6:41:39] <%Agami23> chaos's goal from what shabriri said was full on eva third impact sounding
[6:41:41] <%notsoy> LMFAO
[6:41:42] <+extantCadence> Better or worse than Dung Eater's goal?
[6:41:43] <%X2Eliah> lol
[6:41:43] <%notsoy> wth was that
[6:41:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[6:41:43] <%MartinOfLoxley> LUL
[6:41:44] <%sniffy77> splat
[6:41:44] <oda_flobunaga> LUL
[6:41:44] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt but since life itself is disparity take that to it's logical conclusion
[6:41:45] <42nfl19> NO JOY
[6:41:45] <Onionchamp> The thing that causes madness is shortsighted?
[6:41:47] <%takotoots> LUL
[6:41:47] <HeroToxiko> LOL
[6:41:47] <%AgniBrandt> I'm probably gonna go with frenzied flame just because I'm building around all the frenzy incantations and whatnot
[6:41:48] <%justcallmebobplease> That was a button you pressed.
[6:41:48] <+flychosis> LaterSooner
[6:41:49] <+SodiumPatrol> nice lmao
[6:41:49] <genmypoweralready> Do a flip
[6:41:51] <sweatch0> they want to piss in the ball pit
[6:41:52] <%cade_calrayn> It's reaaaaaaaly not worth it Pat
[6:41:53] <@QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis
[6:41:53] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[6:41:53] <%Maids4lyfe> WHY
[6:41:53] <Frampis> Pat I know you will be a good chaos lord
[6:41:56] <mike2hands> ( goofy yell)
[6:41:57] <+flychosis> sick moves shorty
[6:42:00] <%cade_calrayn> There's no boss down there, why even go down there?
[6:42:01] <penitentpendant> The punishment of being a 'Souls' veteran
[6:42:01] <RyuuAoi> Thought you might survive LUL
[6:42:02] <%AgniBrandt> Because FUCKING EYE LASERS
[6:42:03] <+Grayhammatter> just do a flip
[6:42:06] <%justcallmebobplease> Now you know!
[6:42:10] <%MartinOfLoxley> Backstep into the A B Y S S
[6:42:12] <%cade_calrayn> if you're not going for the ending there's no point
[6:42:12] <%Puhff> Worse than DUngeater cuz at least people are still alive (kinda)
[6:42:15] <+flychosis> just do better
[6:42:17] <RubberFistFight> @plaguedoctor_vi no but that doesn't matter since doing this won't affect that. The last thing i saw was millicent being summoned for i think Morgott, which means she'll have moved to a grace he's about to pick up in the mountains.
[6:42:18] <+flychosis> :)
[6:42:19] <jubejube56> I mean tbf the 2 fingers are bad enough, this faction is led by the 3 fingers and they were considered crazy by literally everyone
[6:42:20] <%Puhff> Frenzied Flame is literally Hell
[6:42:20] <HeroToxiko> It causes madness not because it's shortsighted but because it sees what needs to be done
[6:42:22] <%ElkRiverDog> Really wish you could prock the T Pose emote on your way down
[6:42:25] <biff_rowsdower> subterranean homesick blues
[6:42:29] <NewWillinium> IT sounded like they wanted you to burn the world to ash, so that there was no division between social and racial classes? At least that's what I got from Shabiri.
[6:42:43] <AXL808> even DEEPER DS3 bone-hole
[6:42:43] <%nip_nips> @ElkRiverDog i fuckin love the t-pose emote
[6:42:45] <%Puhff> You control the buttons you press, @PatStaresAt
[6:42:49] <+LandOfTheWay> @captain_thickthighs no, instrumentality wanted to unite people into one person. team frenzy wants to burn literally every facet of the world into one single melting-pot
[6:42:50] <RyuuAoi> This some fuck shit though
[6:42:55] <+acetothemax> Yay
[6:42:56] <%Agami23> because shabriri said "incinerate all that divides and distinguishes". which sounds like turn the world to LCL
[6:43:02] <+flychosis> @Puhff or is is seeing god :O
[6:43:04] <%justcallmebobplease> Are you safe?  That looked like a floor you landed on
[6:43:06] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt that's really good for PVP
[6:43:09] <ape_hawk> is this heat vision?
[6:43:13] <zhenthrim213> its the grab
[6:43:15] <%pabloelenano2> yes is a comand grab and that thing deletes in pvp
[6:43:21] <%justcallmebobplease> They could've put some pushers there!
[6:43:23] <%Agami23> i cant get over that pats jokes about three fingers seemed to be right.
[6:43:23] <RubberFistFight> team frenzy is pyromania writ large
[6:43:28] <%Puhff> @flychosis wut
[6:43:29] <slackerunchained> LOL
[6:43:31] <Estwilde> It's like Ghost Rider's penance stare
[6:43:32] <rosabellamelantha> DO NOT open that door
[6:43:34] <CheeseBurgerHelper> The Frenzy incantations are so sick, I love the ones i found so far
[6:43:35] <%notsoy> hell yeah
[6:43:36] <%cade_calrayn> welp
[6:43:38] <Zebroneath> yes
[6:43:39] <rosabellamelantha> that is the door
[6:43:39] <RubberFistFight> but it may not be a bad thing since the golden order are a bunch of cunts and the two fingers are also cunts.
[6:43:39] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Sure is
[6:43:40] <$bcdenton> Don't door, open inside
[6:43:40] <TwistParabola> there it be

[6:43:44] <%Maids4lyfe> monkaS
[6:43:44] <$SGrim> OPEN THAT DOOR
[6:43:44] <%abakkus> ah. that certainly is a very evil door
[6:43:46] <%tsuchi7> do NOT go naked near it

[6:43:55] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt now look around, there's another way out
[6:43:55] <zhenthrim213> look at SILENT HILL DOOR
[6:43:56] <+ExplodingHye> that is CERTAINLY a door
[6:43:56] <ergulor> eat the door
[6:43:56] <+acetothemax> Yes
[6:43:57] <+possumwalsh1221> Crazy door :)
[6:43:57] <jman13131313> no
[6:43:57] <count1999> no
[6:43:57] <CheeseBurgerHelper> That's a real evil door
[6:43:57] <%cade_calrayn> well that's ominous as FUCK
[6:43:57] <Midnight188> do not touch the evil door, not even for a little trolling
[6:43:59] <%justcallmebobplease> With armor on, yeah.
[6:44:00] <sweatch0> door is closed for a reason
[6:44:00] <DestroPrime83> Just touch it a little
[6:44:01] <%ahdurian> that does seem like an evil door
[6:44:01] <Frampis> DON'T BE SCARED AND OPEN IT
[6:44:01] <$bcdenton> burn it all pat, fuck it
[6:44:02] <plaguedoctor_vi> @RubberFistFight i don´t think i understand what you are saying
[6:44:02] <%Valdorick> Pat is thinking about it
[6:44:02] <+TheBitingIrish> Did Pat find the ultrashield?
[6:44:03] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You are free to touch the door to see the cutscene, there is an out
[6:44:04] <slackerunchained> Don't open that door no matter HOW rad and cool the stuff behind it is! :O
[6:44:04] <PootLoopz> There’s some amazing names in this chat
[6:44:04] <%Maids4lyfe> no
[6:44:04] <%nip_nips> keep your clothes on and you can look at it
[6:44:06] <Sigma_190_Beta> As long as you do not touch it while naked.
[6:44:07] <rosabellamelantha> DO NOT SEEK
[6:44:07] <Elsewize> Looks like an ending.
[6:44:07] <penitentpendant> ! Melina At Risk !
[6:44:09] <%justcallmebobplease> DO NOT go near naked.
[6:44:10] <TwistParabola> "BRUH DONT"
[6:44:10] <WillSin4Cash> o do you not gave the flame of frenzy spell?
[6:44:11] <rosabellamelantha> DO NOT BEAR
[6:44:12] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt now. If you go through this door, you will be locked into a specific ending - HOWEVER there is an exit from it, there always is. And it requires killing an optional boss in an area you're yet to find.
[6:44:13] <dinnydanny777> BEARER SEEK SEEK NOT
[6:44:13] <+Honjudd> DO IT! elaThirst elaThirst

[6:44:45] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Basically, just don't go naked near that door.
[6:44:49] <%BonewheelVanguard> @PatStaresAt to me it sounds like the "skulls for the skull throne, blood for the blood god" ending
[6:44:50] <+flychosis> @Puhff u see to much that's why the hold their eyes like that
[6:44:50] <%notsoy> LOL
[6:44:50] <WillSin4Cash> whaaaaaaa
[6:44:56] <TwistParabola> aha
[6:44:57] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt doing this will get you extra content, and you can use the exit strategy if you decide you don't want the ending. You already have the secondary quest linked to it progressing as it should.
[6:44:57] <+flychosis> they*
[6:44:57] <%Cozy90> MOAR

[6:47:06] <slackerunchained> @rudiciuscaesar I think those are Erdtree ROOTs, so they're getting sun from the leaves up above.

[6:47:21] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt if you want a clearer idea of what going through that door will/won't do, you can hit me or @QueequegTheater up afterwards off-stream so you don't have to deal with a thousand conflicting statements.
[6:47:23] <slackerunchained> POP
[6:47:26] <%cade_calrayn> That's super neat that there's an actual connection between the Capital and the Deeproot Depths
[6:47:29] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> so what are the odds that Ash Lake is at the bottom of this thing?
[6:47:30] <genmypoweralready> Hate ants
[6:47:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> who tf is numen
[6:47:33] <x2Twistedx> i found a way here from a completly different area gezuz
[6:47:33] <TwistParabola> oh read that description
[6:47:34] <rudiciuscaesar> Oh no, that's giving flashbacks to my ex-wife's pregnancy lmao
[6:47:37] <razz_zie> @PatStaresAt Is it safe to say that this game's unique bosses are the coolest? I just watched ur vod, Rykard is a fuckin Apostle
[6:47:37] <bigwompor> FeelsGoodMan
[6:47:40] <JoshyJay> huge coin purse
[6:47:46] <%justcallmebobplease> @ReallyBigRocks Isn't it one of the starting races?
[6:47:46] <IminyourBase> NEWMAN!
[6:47:55] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @ReallyBigRocks Numen are the proto-god race, probably aliens.
[6:48:08] <+RedMaskBandit> normally it's just Abyss
[6:48:18] <rudiciuscaesar> @slackerunchained and the tree is emitting that orangish/gold hue or is the center of the planet doing that? Like, I would expect it to be WAY darker here.
[6:48:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> shits fucked, got it
[6:48:23] <plaguedoctor_vi> @RubberFistFight when you kill fire giant  with the frenzy flame ending it does not lock Melinda end quest?
[6:48:28] <Notterr> Wait, how did he get to this zone? I totally missed it in my playthrough
[6:48:38] <sweatch0> bug moment
[6:48:55] <@QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight That's not through the door
[6:48:56] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Notterr Multiple illusory walls at the bottom of the capital.
[6:48:59] <RubberFistFight> @plaguedoctor_vi no, because there's AN EXIT STRATEGY, i've been saying this the whole time.
[6:49:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> it all started with a little slughole in a sewer
[6:49:05] <%justcallmebobplease> @Notterr Hit alter behind Mohg fight at bottom of dungeon, then keep hitting hidden walls in there.  It's from the Frenzy Flame place.
[6:49:06] <slackerunchained> @rudiciuscaesar The Erdtrees actually DO do a lot of glowing, up above, it seems.
[6:49:07] <tolloponik> @Notterr 2 illusionary walls
[6:49:14] <biff_rowsdower> throw rocks at
[6:49:19] <Notterr> omg, wow
[6:49:23] <Notterr> thanks
[6:49:24] <bassoontyphoon> EDF
[6:49:24] <WillSin4Cash> the frenzy flame seal do be pretty baller tho
[6:49:26] <TwistParabola> ??
[6:49:29] <%Maids4lyfe> lmao
[6:49:29] <@QueequegTheater> @plaguedoctor_vi The needle you get from superboss counteracts the frenzy
[6:49:49] <Purpleleven> You managed to make a flying enemy die completely to fall damage, amazing
[6:49:57] <rudiciuscaesar> @slackerunchained I see it now, the world is radiating light downwards, you can see it as Pat climbs up more on these roots. This place is super cool
[6:50:01] <%Willowight> ants or wasps?
[6:50:23] <plaguedoctor_vi> @RubberFistFight yes i know that but you can only use the needle in the Crumbling azula
[6:50:30] <@Lion_kun> connected the paths
[6:50:35] <sweatch0> wants @Willowight
[6:50:37] <x2Twistedx> @Notterr you can also go to the back of the twin gargoyal boss room and there is a special teleport that will take you here
[6:50:49] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Capital complete
[6:50:54] <RubberFistFight> @plaguedoctor_vi you do realise that melina's quest has at least 3 different endings, right?
[6:50:59] <slackerunchained> @Willowight Fun Fact: Wasps are actually descended from Ants.
[6:51:05] <TwistParabola> right
[6:51:07] <@Lion_kun> I got there through the gargoyle path
[6:51:09] <Wakerz140> @PatStaresAt Bad news, the strongest/heaviest greatshield in the game is on one of those coffins you had to jump down. Unless I was dumb and missed you getting it
[6:51:16] <+LandOfTheWay> i had no idea that was another way to get down here
[6:51:18] <+acetothemax> Wait did he already explore deep root
[6:51:22] <%Willowight> figures
[6:51:25] <Estwilde> That was a cool adventure
[6:51:34] <+LandOfTheWay> @acetothemax yeah
[6:51:38] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> So is Pat in Skypia?
[6:51:39] <%justcallmebobplease> What story bosses did Pat fight today, if any?  I got here super late.
[6:51:41] <%cade_calrayn> TO THE MOUNTAINS!
[6:51:44] <+acetothemax> So he found the lady?
[6:51:45] <TheSandmanIsHere> so you find grace down there?
[6:51:47] <%luftraumm1> i wanna touch the evil dooor
[6:51:52] <@QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight Yes, and it brings you back to the other endings
[6:51:55] <plaguedoctor_vi> @RubberFistFight yes tecnicaly in my ending she did not had to die
[6:51:57] <%cade_calrayn> Port to the Grace next to Shabriri, Pat
[6:52:01] <doster504> @justcallmebobplease Morgott and Rykard from what I saw
[6:52:04] <slackerunchained> @justcallmebobplease Mohh
[6:52:04] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you forgot to grab the grace earlier
[6:52:05] <jacksawjack> you never touched thegrace at the top
[6:52:12] <%cade_calrayn> Oh you never sat at it
[6:52:14] <Midnight188> and then we never went back to the super evil murder flame ever again
[6:52:18] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight then stop saying Pat's gonna fuck up the ending. That's categorically untrue.
[6:52:19] <%cade_calrayn> There's a grace next to Yura/Shabriri
[6:52:22] <Sunstalker> This game scares the FUCK out of me if they ever do a new bloodborne. I can't handle that of such a size
[6:52:24] <slackerunchained> @justcallmebobplease * Mohg
[6:52:28] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt kill shabriri for Yura's armour
[6:52:31] <TwistParabola> there should be a nearby grace you missed
[6:52:32] <%cade_calrayn> Right next to Yura
[6:52:32] <%furiousfurioso> oh you never grabbed it lol
[6:52:39] <zenith0111> Theres graces like every 20 ft
[6:52:40] <rudiciuscaesar> that one cloud looks like a dragon, that can't be a coincidence
[6:52:44] <%justcallmebobplease> @slackerunchained The blood palace Mohg, not the one at the bottom of the dungeon from a bit ago?  The one with the big cutscene and stuff?
[6:52:45] <%cade_calrayn> you were so surprirsed by him that you missed it
[6:52:52] <+acetothemax> yeah
[6:52:53] <plaguedoctor_vi> no
[6:52:54] <%tetraes> Yes
[6:52:55] <Sigma_190_Beta> Yeah.
[6:52:55] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt the funniest part is killing shabriri incurrs ZERO sin
[6:52:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> so overcome with your lust for frenzy
[6:52:56] <%cade_calrayn> and get that sweet sweet hat
[6:52:57] <%luftraumm1> neither sat at the further one in
[6:52:58] <Sigma_190_Beta> I'd say so.
[6:52:59] <TwistParabola> guess so
[6:52:59] <dinnydanny777> Do it
[6:52:59] <Saturation_Lizard> not broken really, this is where it ends for him
[6:53:03] <+acetothemax> he's already possessed
[6:53:04] <Paperware> You must kill Chaos now
[6:53:04] <+Edrem> less broken and more you can always kill him here
[6:53:06] <Sunstalker> I mean, that isn't Yura. And Yura dies anyway earlier
[6:53:07] <plaguedoctor_vi> he died
[6:53:07] <%livi242> not broken but if you aren't gonna do it you can
[6:53:07] <zenith0111> Its mot broken
[6:53:08] <Midnight188> yep. quest is now broken.
[6:53:13] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[6:53:14] <plaguedoctor_vi> when i got the frenzy flame
[6:53:15] <%justcallmebobplease> @justcallmebobplease Oh, Rykard, I'll definitely have to scrub back to catch that - you don't recall whenabouts, do you?
[6:53:16] <@QueequegTheater> Yes
[6:53:22] <Sunstalker> This is natural end point for Yura
[6:53:32] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> STRAW HATS
[6:53:40] <dinnydanny777> Oh his heads just gonna explode with magic
[6:53:44] <Estwilde> madness eye beams
[6:53:49] <ape_hawk> shabooboo
[6:53:49] <%Agami23> apparently shabriri is the name of a jewish demon of blindness
[6:53:53] <%cade_calrayn> looks like you can, numnuts
[6:53:56] <%ospreyworks> Am I crazy for still preferring the overall theme and style of Bloodborne to Elden Ring?
[6:53:57] <@QueequegTheater> We need some white auracite
[6:53:58] <%cade_calrayn> so suck it
[6:53:58] <%AHomeschoolDropout> KILL CHAOS
[6:53:59] <dinnydanny777> I think he died
[6:54:00] <%sniffy77> YEAH WE KILLED CHAOS
[6:54:02] <rudiciuscaesar> imagine if he respawned immediately
[6:54:05] <rudiciuscaesar> like a player character
[6:54:10] <ALazo> CHAOS
[6:54:10] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> WHAT
[6:54:10] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt Yura's quest was just to help him fight a few people, then he dies trying to reach someone whose name i've forgotten and as he dies he pledges himself to chaos. So next you see "him", it's this guy riding his body.
[6:54:11] <Tempmael> t posed on chaos
[6:54:11] <biff_rowsdower> ronin stuff!
[6:54:12] <dante_must_die_exe> dudes NUTS man

[6:54:28] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you need the other half to get over there

[6:54:37] <biff_rowsdower> no...
