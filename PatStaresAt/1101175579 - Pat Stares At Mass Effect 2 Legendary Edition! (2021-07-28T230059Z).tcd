[0:16:30] <+DatAsuna> Fun fact: it's only after the suicide mission that you get the option to let zaeed burn to death on his mission, for some reason.

[0:17:20] <Minorou> firewalker was a lot of nothing
[0:17:20] <+DatAsuna> firewalker is just to introduce a mechanic mostly yeah

[0:21:34] <KetsuoTaberu> "Don't kiss me in the mouth, I eat poop"

[0:22:56] <%Monkeyweed21> @toolofparanoia that bitch was more anti-Japanese than a 2012 game journalist
[0:22:58] <%jackelzxaa> me2 woulda been cool if you got to choose to stay with the alliance (paragon) or work with cerberus (renegade) and that effects which squadmates you are able to recruit
[0:22:59] <%AzureGale> Yeyeyeyeyeye

[0:23:44] <%baka_sugoi> ....
[0:23:45] <%jackelzxaa> it was!
[0:23:45] <%MisterRockett> It really was.
[0:23:47] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig facts
[0:23:48] <%RealThiele> swan hatted game journos
[0:23:49] <%ahomeschooldropout> Racist-Adjacent
[0:23:51] <%dilly2lame> PREACH!!
[0:23:53] <+MidnightBurst12> very racist
[0:23:54] <%jackelzxaa> phil fish!
[0:23:54] <OldManDeckardCain> at least still not as anti japanese as FDR with his concentration camps back in the day
[0:23:54] <+ThomasOfTroy> A little racist, and VERY stupid
[0:23:55] <stantheman_97> it was straight up racism
[0:23:56] <marvel877> Phil Fish?
[0:23:56] <sapphomet777> japan as a devspace....terrifies me but like...japan cant make games? for fuckin REAL?
[0:23:58] <DSD24> This is really whack
[0:23:59] <+SinnerEbru> yeah
[0:24:02] <artoflec> western games are still so behind 10 years layer
[0:24:02] <%toolofparanoia> FUCK THOSE PEOPLE
[0:24:02] <ShinyVagikarp> LUL
[0:24:07] <Profmcstevie> That shit also failed completely, as Western games are losing their footing
[0:24:09] <+D00msDayDan> god i remember that shit
[0:24:09] <%Monkeyweed21> remember when Jason Schreir called Dragon's Crown pedo bait because it was Japanese?
[0:24:10] <%jackelzxaa> remember when casey hudson said "we shouldn't have a boss fight in me3, it's too videogamey"
[0:24:11] <sgtbloopface> then dark sould happened lmao
[0:24:12] <%Dakuu75> just remove the GAME out of the VIDEO GAME
[0:24:12] <sapphomet777> im a game designer and fuck those people shits alllwed to be FUN
[0:24:17] <BallerSwagBro9k> Anyone who hates boss fights can suck deez nuts
[0:24:18] <%Cykron> It's stupid but not racist
[0:24:18] <%Deft_Thought> Western games are obsessed with every game being a film
[0:24:18] <%cvp5127> the west hates anime
[0:24:19] <James_Quivers> It was jsut games journalists being games journalists, stiring up shit for clicks
[0:24:22] <%baka_sugoi> someone couldn't get passed the first boss in dark souls
[0:24:25] <%jackelzxaa> or theyre bad at videogames
[0:24:26] <+ultimafullmetal> Phil Fish bitterLOL
[0:24:26] <Vikingincognito> What motivated that whole thing? Like, Resident evil and Metal gear were still popular right?
[0:24:26] <+Exicuren> Ah yes, back then? that was such horseshit masked as "progressiveness"
[0:24:26] <BinaryShuffle> Monster Hunter is just boss fights, and it's the best
[0:24:33] <%jackelzxaa> and they like western games because they're easy and for babies
[0:24:34] <GuyverTypeL> bosses bad
[0:24:35] <+DatAsuna> More xenophobic than racist but yes. It happens a lot more with chinese devs nowadays.
[0:24:37] <%RealThiele> gimme dem bosses
[0:24:40] <Goraka91> Why do enemies have health? The entire game should be a cinematic piece of art
[0:24:43] <Mattais88> Mass Effect has terrible bosses. 7/10 times their just waves of normal enemies
[0:24:47] <%Deft_Thought> Subpar gameplay gets trumped by having a "cinematic" gaming experience
[0:24:49] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[0:24:49] <Zebroneath> GOTTEM
[0:24:52] <%ElkRiverDog> I wonder if that contributed to the resistance from Japanese developers about using western developed tec like rollback
[0:24:53] <Profmcstevie> ITS THE SAME WITH "ugh pixels"
[0:24:53] <%ssjklyco> His 10 followers are upset now
[0:24:53] <bob900000> I'm glad I skipped the ps3/360 era
[0:24:53] <marvel877> NAME THEM
[0:25:00] <%Deft_Thought> That's why Western media loves Kojima so damn much
[0:25:04] <Meekest> He can't remember them
[0:25:12] <sapphomet777> As a design grad who hated her peers, Never ever ever take design tips from journalist feedback
[0:25:15] <i_need_sciss0rz> @patstaresat did you ever play more of death's door?
[0:25:17] <James_Quivers> Golddick Dickdick
[0:25:18] <Meekest> Egh I forgot about ME Pat's fish face
[0:25:18] <%weissguard> NICE
[0:25:20] <%andrewofbob> Mass effect's combat system just doesn't lend itself too well to boss fights
[0:25:21] <%jackelzxaa> In western games normal means “for normal people” in japanese games normal means “for normal gamers”
[0:25:22] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[0:25:25] <+DatAsuna> Andromeda has the only boss fight in the entire series that even rises to the level of just "neat"
[0:25:25] <%SaiyanShoto> Goldlewis has a straight up Pat color
[0:25:27] <ElenaManetta> the penis mucus build-up
[0:25:28] <%The_Protagonist> psaJpeg

[0:25:41] <sapphomet777> hell yea orby say my name
[0:25:44] <%baka_sugoi> informer
[0:25:48] <%Pappajimbo> Left in the dust of history
[0:25:55] <Profmcstevie> Journalists need clicks and attention, they are by default expected to have bad opinions
[0:25:55] <%baka_sugoi> lol
[0:26:00] <ape_hawk> theres a reason people call easy modes "journalist mode"
[0:26:00] <+DatAsuna> the conspiracy influencer
[0:26:01] <sapphomet777> i also have ubi dirt lmaooo
[0:26:01] <%viewtifulr> an influencer by many names

[0:26:20] <%baka_sugoi> i liked Army of two
[0:26:34] <%jackelzxaa> How many journalists are passionate and how many of them are “meee”?
[0:26:42] <sapphomet777> COLOR THEORY WAS LOST IN THE 00S
[0:26:51] <sapphomet777> COLOR THEORY MADE HALO 1 AND 2 DAMMIT
[0:26:52] <Profmcstevie> WHY DO PEOPLE ON GRAPHIC TEAMS LACK EYES
[0:26:54] <GuyverTypeL> BIG HMM HMM
[0:26:55] <%baka_sugoi> BROWN
[0:26:55] <Vikingincognito> Army of 2 The 40th Day was stupid as shit but really fun to play
[0:26:55] <%toolofparanoia> did they fix it?
[0:26:58] <%RealThiele> now its all blue and orange
[0:26:58] <%logoth_> Should have listened to Woolie and used to Color Wheel
[0:26:59] <James_Quivers> Note: add more red and blue
[0:27:00] <ape_hawk> obviously they dont see color, patrick
[0:27:02] <jorniev> WOW
[0:27:03] <%Dakuu75> I mean, it might've not been THAT particular guy's call but, he can tell it's stupid

[0:28:04] <Dunmarkh> Glad you're bringing tali to flex on liara
[0:28:05] <%Dakuu75> @cvp5127 If the dude showed Pat his notes, and it was jsut a big picture of dickbutt. Pat would ask him to sign it and let him keep it
[0:28:06] <sapphomet777> Oh my god. OH MY GOD. THAT ADIOS SHIT. actual narrative design anyuresm
[0:28:08] <%Rumbutt> they totally missed THE WHOLE POINT
[0:28:08] <jorniev> YES
[0:28:10] <DSD24> Ohhh
[0:28:10] <%Axellogic> but im barely payin attention
[0:28:23] <Profmcstevie> Oh they just don't get the point
[0:28:25] <%Rumbutt> HOW CAN THEY NOT GET IT
[0:28:28] <%captain_thickthighs> captain_thickthighs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Sup people have a good summer. also Pat I noticed something at work why do French Candains insist on speaking french at staff even when the know english and are in the carribean?
[0:28:30] <sapphomet777> WHY CANT I BE A FASC IN DISCO!!!! WHY BLACK LADY MEANE
[0:28:32] <%MaxeusTheFirst> MaxeusTheFirst subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Pretty bummed out about the stuff with blizzard/activison and getting ready to quit the game for good. The feeling just sucks.
[0:28:34] <%Monkeyweed21> @DSD24 there are dialogue choices that your character wants to say but cant work up the nerve to do it
[0:28:41] <Meekest> I have to write a review of this game in an hour and I dont give a shit about it so idk how to play it
[0:28:46] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Qaussy
[0:28:46] <James_Quivers> No, they write vapid thoughts about games for a living, big difference
[0:28:48] <%dilly2lame> Hope Doc is doing good
[0:28:52] <Minorou> she's an information broker, she probably already knows
[0:28:56] <BallerSwagBro9k> Tell the Blussy about the Qussy
[0:28:56] <Zebroneath> LOL
[0:28:56] <%RealThiele> The Qussy
[0:28:57] <mighty_fine_trousers> He already do the firewalker stuff?
[0:28:57] <+ultimafullmetal> Does it explicitly tell you that you never can or do you just know that cause you're friends with its creator?
[0:28:57] <stantheman_97> purple pussy better than blue pussy
[0:29:00] <Profmcstevie> I am genius anything I fail at is bad
[0:29:01] <+DatAsuna> but the gamecube is indigo
[0:29:05] <GuyverTypeL> She can smell the qussy
[0:29:07] <%demiiluna> BRING NEW QUSSY ALONG WITH OLD BLUSSY
[0:29:07] <%ahomeschooldropout> My favorite are the ones where it's clearly the person reviewing it just didn't finish it and pretend to. See: that one guy who stopped Nier at Ending A
[0:29:08] <BallerSwagBro9k> BEST RLC
[0:29:08] <KetsuoTaberu> @PatStaresAt have you seen the "Dean's shameful cuphead demo vs Pigeon intelligence test" video

[0:29:17] <%ElkRiverDog> @dilly2lame Same
[0:29:18] <DSD24> Why is Liara less blue now
[0:29:21] <sapphomet777> meekest, focus on figuring out its game play loop at least and critique that
[0:29:28] <James_Quivers> NEW THANE
[0:29:33] <jorniev> BUY ADIOS so DOC makes that game with anime girls and a girl with a shotgun bigger than her, also so he can pay medical bills
[0:29:35] <Dunmarkh> what
[0:29:38] <%BlackStarAura> he got this DICK, girl
[0:29:39] <+DatAsuna> they use that name in SWTOR as well. lmao
[0:29:40] <%jackelzxaa> The problem with games journalism is they shotgun games a single time, sometimes not to completion, and chug through them as fast as possible, and then they write hot takes for people who play games over and over who dont relate
[0:29:44] <Mattais88> Only other Drell outside of Thane's family
[0:29:46] <%toolofparanoia> FERON WAS IN THE GRAPHIC NOVEL
[0:29:46] <Dunmarkh> WHAT
[0:29:46] <secret_npc> It was a whole comic
[0:29:57] <ElenaManetta> your character's face reminds me of hank schrader from breaking bad, except for the eyes
[0:30:00] <Jane_Lo> @DSD24 i think she comes to normal colour later, but for some reason this model is like that
[0:30:08] <Dunmarkh> AND YOU STILL CUCKED HER
[0:30:19] <Sheenius> Is the audio delayed

[0:34:39] <secret_npc> lowkey best asari coming through
[0:34:44] <Vikingincognito> TELA MARRY ME
[0:34:44] <%jackelzxaa> For as much as people complain about the main plot in me3, the side stuff is extremely kino
[0:34:49] <DSD24> @Vikingincognito Her armor especially
[0:34:49] <stantheman_97> YO
[0:34:49] <sapphomet777> Dammit bros, i have gay

[0:34:58] <Mattais88> I'll sign your chest girl
[0:34:59] <+D00msDayDan> this is like the only other spectre in the whole game
[0:34:59] <GuyverTypeL> Not many encounter with specters
[0:35:05] <TheMostAverageGamer4> finallly
[0:35:07] <%toolofparanoia> Don
[0:35:07] <ape_hawk> a spectre thats blue AND purple! shepard is throbbing right now
[0:35:07] <Minorou> Saren counted. Sorta.
[0:35:08] <%jackelzxaa> Another specty!
[0:35:09] <Latija> is this the first one after saren?
[0:35:11] <Mattais88> One that you don't try to kill immediatly
[0:35:12] <+ThomasOfTroy> And she's even NOT trying to kill you!
[0:35:13] <Profmcstevie> That I don't wanna kill too!
[0:35:16] <James_Quivers> Nihalis is crying in his grave
[0:35:18] <sapphomet777> tela could punch IN MY TITS and id apologize
[0:35:18] <%toolofparanoia> Don't worry you meet more in 3
[0:35:19] <ahaegotrigger> I mean you already met Saren
[0:35:21] <+tinytinykittycat> how you think thats gonna go?
[0:35:25] <%ahomeschooldropout> Best part of ME3 is the fact that your squadmates actually interacted and talked to each other in the ship @jackelzxaa
[0:35:25] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> nihlus
[0:35:30] <%castlerock42> Yeah, remember when Specters were a big deal? The series doesn't.
[0:35:31] <%captain_thickthighs> I dont trust her
[0:35:31] <DSD24> There's a cool Salarian spectre in ME3
[0:35:35] <+cermo55> IT's really a shame we don't meet more Specters throughout the series
[0:35:37] <MidnightPacif1c> she has dope shoulder armor
[0:35:44] <ahaegotrigger> there was also Nhilus
[0:35:47] <%The_Protagonist> how did she know she was there for 4 minutes then?
[0:35:47] <sapphomet777> i can'tbeleive mass effect 3 has a "Blasto Ending"
[0:35:48] <secret_npc> How would you know she had a kinetic barrier?
[0:35:49] <Vikingincognito> Tela's whole design and writing are all so cool
[0:35:54] <%HaroldDonchee> is it still paranoid when it's completely proven to be needed?
[0:35:55] <%jackelzxaa> You meet a few spectres in 3..
[0:36:11] <+DatAsuna> I use a Tela Vasir xcom mod as my main templar unit lol
[0:36:15] <+D00msDayDan> is that aria t'loak's VA?
[0:36:17] <DSD24> That's some crazy rain
[0:36:25] <%MaxeusTheFirst> I always loved having non-symetical shoulder armor. Soo cool
[0:36:26] <+Ghufufin> thats a good line
[0:36:29] <+cermo55> Total Specter count: Saren, Nialus, Tela, Salarian in 3
[0:36:31] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt They shot from a car.
[0:36:32] <$SGrim> Good scope
[0:36:33] <Dunmarkh> Driveby?
[0:36:33] <Meekest> Or spaceship
[0:36:34] <DSD24> She curved the bullets
[0:36:36] <+DatAsuna> @D00msDayDan no, this girl doesn't phone it in like her
[0:36:37] <%HaroldDonchee> or a ship
[0:36:38] <%andrewofbob> Easy shot for Garrus
[0:36:38] <Aiutare47> couldve shot from a car
[0:36:38] <+cermo55> any more?
[0:36:42] <%toolofparanoia> the anti-material rifle
[0:36:45] <James_Quivers> The other half that Legion didn't take
[0:36:49] <sapphomet777> the best bioware RPG characters visually are queer coded but non rmanceable as a girl, speaking of strong ass women
[0:36:51] <Laecerelius> Wanna cover the hole with this?
[0:36:58] <Treasure_Vault> Imagine the Wanted shot, but it hits the window and stops
[0:37:00] <secret_npc> If you picked a better class you cpuld have that fancy rifle 👀
[0:37:01] <Daxalog> No holes either
[0:37:05] <Profmcstevie> SHEPARD COMMANDER.....PLEASE GIVE MrDestructoid
[0:37:06] <BallerSwagBro9k> Hey guys....remember Attack of the Clones? Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:37:10] <Latija> its a human kitchen too
[0:37:11] <+ThomasOfTroy> I mean, modern rifles can shoot that far
[0:37:14] <Halospaz117> Just make Legion "Shepard 2.0"
[0:37:15] <stantheman_97> very human kitchen
[0:37:16] <ape_hawk> not everything in space has to be space-like
[0:37:17] <%Bluwizard21> I've seen higher tech kitchens
[0:37:17] <%andrewofbob> Pat, what would you do with more kitchen than this?
[0:37:19] <%dilly2lame> function over form
[0:37:20] <%ainzhelm> Ok but those fucking chairs tho
[0:37:23] <+ThomasOfTroy> @BallerSwagBro9k Don't remind us
[0:37:23] <ElenaManetta> more screens on stuff, like a screen on a fridge you can get now
[0:37:24] <%Monkeyweed21> well yea its on a planet
[0:37:24] <%toolofparanoia> a food replicator
[0:37:25] <%Rumbutt> after fucking you Liara became a human fetishist, that's why her kitchen looks like it belongs on earth
[0:37:27] <%Dakuu75> tiny light-saber bread knife
[0:37:27] <%RealThiele> Mr. Coffe
[0:37:29] <%Ziegsy> what, no replictor?
[0:37:29] <dd44dostivei> COOL ALIEN DOCTORATE LIARA
[0:37:30] <%captain_thickthighs> does it have an island?
[0:37:30] <Treasure_Vault> That table is kept up with a mass effect field
[0:37:30] <%jackelzxaa> Hey remember the star wars prequels?
[0:37:31] <KetsuoTaberu> Bioware doesn't either, that's why the kitchen looks like that
[0:37:32] <+DatAsuna> @sapphomet777 shout outs to jade empire, first bioware game to let you be bi, and have a threesome
[0:37:32] <%HaroldDonchee> I think it actually had a stove top
[0:37:33] <+D00msDayDan> needs more space
[0:37:35] <%luketrapwalker> @BallerSwagBro9k oh gawd dude
[0:37:36] <%bread_assassin> Weird that Asari somehow have the same standard for kitchens as we do.
[0:37:39] <%xcompleasedad> We have kinda mastered the kitchen
[0:37:40] <GuyverTypeL> 2 whole games after being introduced, but again, specters are supposed to be selected, so I guess that makes their number really low
[0:37:40] <sougoe> kitchen technology stagnated after the war
[0:37:41] <Mattais88> Why is it in English though?
[0:37:41] <ElenaManetta> or how about the robo-arms auto-chef that engineers want to make
[0:37:44] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> That's not an alien degree
[0:37:45] <+SinnerEbru> highkey thought that said university of science
[0:37:46] <terrible35> all kitchens are technically space kitchens
[0:37:48] <Ravioli_Ronin> Kitchen is one of those things where it’s really not gonna change all that much over time
[0:37:50] <%RealThiele> plain ass paper
[0:37:51] <TheFramedWarlock> That's literally just a kitchen
[0:37:57] <James_Quivers> BOX OF ROCKS
[0:37:59] <%Monkeyweed21> FISH
[0:38:00] <dd44dostivei> that degree pisses me off so much
[0:38:01] <%ahomeschooldropout> Amazing how degrees having never changed in 200 years and also the fact that every species just coincidentally have the exact same design for degrees
[0:38:02] <$StrawberryPantsu> Why would a space alien have a paper degree written in englihs?
[0:38:03] <Sigma_190_Beta> It's a snake dude.
[0:38:05] <DSD24> Aww
[0:38:06] <Mattais88> Souldn't her degree be in Asari?
[0:38:06] <%andrewofbob> I bet they're prothean rocks
[0:38:10] <$StrawberryPantsu> *english even
[0:38:11] <+tinytinykittycat> from ilos
[0:38:12] <KetsuoTaberu> swipe to shepard's nudes
[0:38:12] <%Dakuu75> too many windows. I'd be paranoid ppl are watching me
[0:38:13] <stantheman_97> awwwwww
[0:38:13] <+SataruYamate> where is camera
[0:38:15] <secret_npc> This is a boring rich person apartment
[0:38:18] <Aiutare47> @StrawberryPantsu its in common
[0:38:18] <%jackelzxaa> Pat expected the kitchenware to have mass effect fields
[0:38:23] <%Monkeyweed21> those rocks are prolly from Illos
[0:38:25] <+ThomasOfTroy> Why do aliens use the same diploma layout as western countries, let alone english
[0:38:31] <James_Quivers> Which is a protheon dig site, don't worry about it
[0:38:34] <mrtanaka111> has pat mrried legion already?
[0:38:37] <+Shady_Zaku> lol
[0:38:42] <+Exicuren> Well, yeaj, it was a prthean dig site, tho
[0:38:43] <%toolofparanoia> cause there was a prothean dig site there
[0:38:44] <%captain_thickthighs> @StrawberryPantsu even in space you cant avoid american online college adds
[0:38:46] <Zebroneath> it's a rock
[0:38:47] <zubasterd> no Pat don't look at the man behind the curtain
[0:38:48] <Minorou> why need kitchenware when literally everybody has an omnitool
[0:38:48] <Profmcstevie> Hopefully it doesn't have an IGN watermark too
[0:38:52] <%RealThiele> fancy rocks
[0:38:56] <secret_npc> Cause Liara horny for the hoomans
[0:39:01] <Treasure_Vault> Pat used the Sword of Avowal on Legion and now he's set for the good ending
[0:39:03] <%jackelzxaa> A screenshot of Eden Prime’s prothean dig site!
[0:39:06] <Vikingincognito> @ThomasOfTroy There are visual translators in thier eys as well as audio one in the ears?

Noice.Unrelated but Pat, have you ever followed a series to get a good grasp of the lore, forget about it for years, then come back to see the bullshit its become?

[0:42:47] <%andrewofbob> If Pat did speedruns, he'd only do 100% runs
[0:42:50] <%toolofparanoia> GOBLINED
[0:42:55] <GuyverTypeL> Do we even care about upgrades now that we finished the main quest?
[0:43:01] <%jackelzxaa> Theres an upgrade on zaeeds mission you could only get on the renegade path
[0:43:21] <%ainzhelm> Did he really just say he doesnt care?
[0:43:24] <Minorou> would you smooch a robot
[0:43:29] <+Shady_Zaku> @guyvertypel Better take it with you!
[0:43:32] <%toolofparanoia> Kiss Legion right on his nose... eye... face... flashlight
[0:43:36] <Profmcstevie> Hearing Legions mechanical legs behind me is making me jumpy, I'd probably shoot him by accident

[0:44:09] <DSD24> Shadow Broker doods look good color scheme wise
[0:44:11] <+Shady_Zaku> Goddam a nuke launcher LMFAO! how did I never get this before? I gotta try that thing out whenever I play next
[0:44:12] <ElenaManetta> did they STAY inside the building after detonating a bomb, or did they just climb in
[0:44:13] <%ainzhelm> I FUCKING LOVE THIS THEME SO MUCH
[0:44:15] <%toolofparanoia> reskined mercs
[0:44:16] <ChungusQuest> They're just gooning it up here in the flaming wreckage
[0:44:19] <dd44dostivei> lol this dark knight music
[0:44:25] <%logoth_> Shotgun to the gonads
[0:44:25] <AzureInTheDark> Love Legion.
[0:44:29] <secret_npc> It's a good combat theme
[0:44:40] <+critikal_bit> Shadow Broker music fucking slaps
[0:44:44] <%toolofparanoia> they have sonic nades
[0:45:13] <brandt_connors> does he not use melee
[0:45:13] <+DatAsuna> kasumi DLC had the best music but shadow broker was a strong second
[0:45:14] <BigFingerRo> DOUBURRUBBUKEEN
[0:45:18] <jorniev> MUSIC
[0:45:28] <%toolofparanoia> terminal access!
[0:45:40] <DSD24> I can't wait for the POWAH DUNK in ME3 with Nova
[0:45:45] <jorniev> this dlc had the best boss fight
[0:45:49] <+DeadlyPeaks> Does Pat know Legion is Wesker?
[0:45:49] <%toolofparanoia> M O N E Y
[0:45:55] <BobbsonDugnutt> Space bucks! PogChamp
[0:45:58] <GuyverTypeL> yw
[0:45:58] <%Dakuu75> they sure do like solid-white walls and floors int he future
[0:46:08] <jorniev> legion is voiced by wesker?
[0:46:08] <%ainzhelm> @DSD24 I cant wait for it because he will get himself killed more
[0:46:09] <%Monkeyweed21> and Wrex is Goldlewis
[0:46:15] <Profmcstevie> Money?! we don't use that
[0:46:19] <+DatAsuna> yeah ME3 fixed a lto of vanguard's problems
[0:46:23] <ElenaManetta> pat's not in it for the money, he's in it for the upgrades
[0:46:27] <%Bluwizard21> do they have any roll over between 2 and 3?
[0:46:38] <%Astrophizz> and what's his name is Pete from kingdom hearts
[0:46:40] <+BlackIronVengarl> gamer hours
[0:46:41] <+DatAsuna> y'know the sad shit is that even in LE, soldier is still the most picked class at 40%
[0:46:43] <Dunmarkh> they go up to 6 pat
[0:46:47] <secret_npc> money rolls into 3
[0:46:58] <Minorou> I like being Sentinel for maximum beef
[0:46:59] <%Dakuu75> @ElenaManetta probably the first time I've seen him NOT care about a number going up.
[0:47:00] <%The_Protagonist> maximum beefitude
[0:47:01] <Jmann1892> But you could be even Beefier
[0:47:02] <Daxalog> im bummed out engineer was only played by like 6% of the playerbase but soldier was played by like 44%
[0:47:05] <secret_npc> Soldier is an incredible class
[0:47:06] <ElenaManetta> nobody who seeks power STOPS after hitting a certain power limit
[0:47:07] <%jackelzxaa> Pat did you return to stores after the derilect collector ship mission? The stores add stock throughout the game after major mandatory missions
[0:47:10] <brandt_connors> go back
[0:47:12] <BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat There is gun you can pick up in this building
[0:47:13] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[0:47:14] <bellmorgu> missed
[0:47:14] <%jackelzxaa> Pat the upgrades go past the limit
[0:47:19] <jorniev> i feel like next ME should have classes and subclasses so your main guy is the best trained character
[0:47:20] <dd44dostivei> they also forgot to make this area outer space
[0:47:20] <TrollKing96> Missed salvage.
[0:47:22] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> psaBig psaBig psaBlind psaBlind
[0:47:36] <%logoth_> Shadow Broker should invest in Kinetic barriers
[0:47:46] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> psaBlind psaBlind
[0:48:00] <Vikingincognito> Having played through normal ME2&3 plus Legendary 2&3 it stand out to me that you are wearing armor that was originally only in me3. You can tell because of the level of shiny mirror like reflection on it that isn't present in any ME2 armors.
[0:48:03] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[0:48:05] <+DatAsuna> @Daxalog at least engineers get that one story moment in omega lol
[0:48:14] <%toolofparanoia> SHOTGUNNED

[0:51:17] <Minorou> she's also running from another spectre + 2 buddies

[0:54:36] <+Ghufufin> sheperd secretly a fan of 2Fast 4000 Furious

[0:55:12] <DSD24> Level up Liara Pat!
[0:55:13] <%BlackStarAura> I think
[0:55:15] <+DatAsuna> because they're cops
[0:55:15] <+Archmortal> it's almost like there should be a bit more than zero oversight of Spectres
[0:55:17] <%ainzhelm> @PatStaresAt UPGRADE LIARA
[0:55:19] <%Monkeyweed21> Nihilus was also a shitbag
[0:55:22] <%toolofparanoia> When you have all that power, why not be evil?
[0:55:22] <Treasure_Vault> Power leads to facism or something?
[0:55:23] <+Kyma1020> Nhilus is also a shitbag
[0:55:24] <anAngryHamster> Only 1 billion credits in damage. A net gain for our city!
[0:55:34] <stantheman_97> nihilus was also a shitbag according to samara
[0:55:36] <dredgyboi> doesnt samara say nihilus was a shit bag too ?
[0:55:41] <%dilly2lame> sounds like Snake
[0:55:44] <SaltyAzteca> Wait he took Tali? Is that not awkward LUL
[0:55:52] <+flexin_apex> I hate this part on insanity
[0:55:53] <DSD24> That looked silly
[0:55:56] <GuyverTypeL> I like Tali maing it clear that thedrone we see it's not hers, a nice little detail

[0:57:49] <Daxalog> Yup
[0:57:54] <DSD24> @ComfortableStranger I did! most people saved the Geth and the Quarians
[0:58:07] <%ConLin_Arts_> oh noooo
[0:58:09] <James_Quivers> @ComfortableStranger Everyone hates reporters confirmed
[0:58:13] <Daxalog> Surpriising seeing the party members people actually used or cared about
[0:58:17] <%BlackStarAura> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[0:58:18] <%dilly2lame> Not enough people saved Kaidan
[0:58:19] <%ConLin_Arts_> Give him the toys
[0:58:21] <ElenaManetta> why doesn't zangief just ground pound and knock the toys loose?
[0:58:23] <yourliteraldog> Geth did nothing wrong
[0:58:25] <Vikingincognito> @ComfortableStranger YEah, I'm TERRIBLY dissapointed that Male-Soldeir Shep is still the most common kind
[0:58:26] <+ComfortableStranger> @DSD24 it was pretty much what I expected
[0:58:29] <%captain_thickthighs> so who does hetake after?
[0:58:38] <+DatAsuna> @ComfortableStranger yee, plebs pick soldier and mash a through the creation screen lol
[0:58:45] <%toolofparanoia> where the twin peaks reference at?
[0:58:53] <%ahomeschooldropout> Surprised Sentinel is the second-least picked class. Sentinel is fucking OP as fuck
[0:58:54] <Teras_ode> taking after dad Kappa
[0:58:57] <%Monkeyweed21> Qussy is down
[0:59:06] <ElenaManetta> you knocked him so hard he's going to come flying from the other side of the planet in 20 seconds
[0:59:07] <%ainzhelm> He died on the way back to his home planet
[0:59:12] <Vikingincognito> I couldn't imagine being so boring as to pick default soldier shep
[0:59:13] <DSD24> Nah Soldier is fine people want access to all the weapons
[0:59:16] <%dilly2lame> Sentinel is so much fun
[0:59:27] <+ComfortableStranger> @ComfortableStranger yyeah that was hilarious, not sure about the male shep thing, soldier was the obvious choice for noobs
[0:59:27] <Halospaz117> Fuck that guy in partiuclar
[0:59:30] <+Shady_Zaku> @monkeyweed21 QUSSY?? LMFAO
[0:59:35] <Vikingincognito> Soldeir is the least intersting class. Thats a fact
[0:59:51] <%ahomeschooldropout> Engineer is OP as fuck in ME1 and in ME2 and 3 it's low-key also OP as fuck. Using the Drone is fucking cheesy
[0:59:52] <SaltyAzteca> PERSONAL SPACE, OUTTA MY FACE
[0:59:53] <%king_wragles> So is Tali dying?
[0:59:53] <Halospaz117> Did... that guy just UN-flank you?
[0:59:53] <%Monkeyweed21> @ahomeschooldropout despite Tech armor being broken strong its overall a very passive playstyle, especially compared to Vanguard and Infiltrator
[0:59:55] <Profmcstevie> Soldier is familiar to a casual third person shooter player
[0:59:55] <mr_saturday93> engineer master race
[0:59:57] <DSD24> @Vikingincognito I feel like that's by design since its the GUN class
[0:59:58] <%ainzhelm> ME1 soldier is for people who want heavy armor
[1:00:04] <SaltyAzteca> CLUUUTCH
[1:00:05] <+D00msDayDan> @Shady_Zaku welcome to pat's ME streams
[1:00:10] <James_Quivers> Almost ate your words there lmao

[1:00:17] <+alphonseisbest> Soldeir is the least intersting class PogChamp fact
[1:00:19] <%andrewofbob> @ahomeschooldropout Heavy drone or exploding drone?
[1:00:21] <stantheman_97> fucking clutch
[1:00:26] <Vikingincognito> @ahomeschooldropout I did my first Engineer run ever recently and it was AMAZING
[1:00:31] <BigFingerRo> @SaltyAzteca SOCIAL DISTANCING
[1:00:44] <DSD24> God the depressing artpartment
[1:00:47] <yourliteraldog> Mass Effect is story of the most generic yet simultaneously ugliest man or woman in the galaxy. Saving the galaxy with far more intresting compainions.
[1:00:48] <GuyverTypeL> I can not read qussy as "Quantum Pussy"
[1:00:54] <%BlackStarAura> Vasir’s car has an UPGRADE

[1:17:25] <%jackelzxaa> there is a scene near the end of the dlc to rekindle liara's romance, but it doesn't effect the me2 romance flag. you can import into me3 with both tali and liara flagged and whichever you romance first in me3 will just lock you in. just so you know not to be afraid of making decisions in the dlc, pat

[1:18:31] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt When did Liara change her mind on the threesomes.

[1:19:17] <%Dakuu75> Shepard looks so pissed
[1:19:18] <%jackelzxaa> pat don't worry about messing up tali's romance by making decisions later in this dlc. there's some stuff that is worth seeing that is optional near the end. even if you hook up with liara again, tali will stay with you into your me3 import. they do not conflict until you choose in 3
[1:19:18] <%strakillias> Tali just sittin over there in the awkward corner
[1:19:18] <%Puhff> ok this is cool

[1:21:51] <%hax_metatron> I ain't gonna lie, Citadel DLC in ME3 is better than this, but this is one of the coolest missions in RPGs
[1:21:53] <+Shady_Zaku> POPPIN QUSSY PRINGLES
[1:21:53] <%Keaton_x> Once you pop, the fun don't stop

[1:22:57] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:22:57] <%Rumbutt> they did
[1:22:58] <%Torus1025> They do!
[1:22:59] <DSD24> They did in ME3
[1:22:59] <Mattais88> Wait till 3
[1:23:00] <choocheess> LUL
[1:23:00] <%jackelzxaa> me3 has REALLY good melee
[1:23:01] <+DatAsuna> They did in 3
[1:23:02] <%AgniBrandt> Shadow Borker feels like something that should be in Charles Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaiden
[1:23:03] <secret_npc> oh no I shot omni gel everywhere
[1:23:04] <%hax_metatron> Tali would be totally okay with a threesome IMO
[1:23:04] <James_Quivers> They do tho
[1:23:04] <stormhawk9891> They do
[1:23:05] <+ScreamLord> Wait til ME3
[1:23:07] <somekindofsam> they do in 3
[1:23:07] <chrishansen69_> Let me guess.. Bioware became doctors again, they saving lives. Ea Bioware just ruining expectations
[1:23:09] <Alzero83> FiThey fixed it in 3
[1:23:09] <sougoe> shepard is just that strong
[1:23:10] <+cermo55> they did with a lazer knife
[1:23:11] <%alternative_flu> I feel like they didn't do much improvement with ME2 for the legendary edition
[1:23:13] <secret_npc> You'll enjoy 3, Pat
[1:23:14] <DSD24> The actual best melee in ME3
[1:23:14] <%Ranryu692> ME3 has so many nice QOL improvements
[1:23:15] <%AncelDeLambert> you say that like you don't know exactly what the ME3 multiplayer was sold on
[1:23:16] <%Ipsenscastle> 'the Shadow Borker? No, I'm the Shadow Bonker, and this is my associate, the Shadow Borger. You want the next office on the left.'
[1:23:20] <peachy996> They improved it in 3 and de-improved come Andromeda
[1:23:25] <Daxalog> 3 has a sword
[1:23:27] <%andrewofbob> @PatStaresAt You're going to love the biotic punch in ME3
[1:23:37] <%Ranryu692> @alternative_flu they didn't. ME1 only got the attention it did because it needed it
[1:23:41] <GuyverTypeL> Isn't it a robo-boop tho?
[1:23:44] <peachy996> Andromeda took out the Heavy Melee animation and it really hurt it
[1:23:46] <secret_npc> Did you spec your armor for Melee, Pat?
[1:23:53] <%RetroCop87> "We'll let you watch while we do it. You cab be our Shadow Porker."
[1:23:53] <%AncelDeLambert> this ship is just the gas mining facility in Empire Strikes Back
[1:23:54] <Profmcstevie> Dreams outpacing skills
[1:23:59] <+DatAsuna> dissidia was good
[1:24:00] <%cvp5127> kh2
[1:24:01] <%jackelzxaa> but pat what about kingdom hearts
[1:24:05] <Mattais88> Kingdom Hearts 2 was sick
[1:24:09] <Profmcstevie> KH2 is still fucking incredible
[1:24:09] <%Astrophizz> not squares strong suit
[1:24:10] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> kh2
[1:24:12] <+Archmortal> Kingdom Hearts 2 on had good action, they just never gave FF good action
[1:24:14] <%Monkeyweed21> Kingdom Hearts 2
[1:24:16] <yourliteraldog> Fucks ass
[1:24:18] <count_bob> KH2
[1:24:18] <%jackelzxaa> didnt nomura's team make ff7 remake tho?
[1:24:19] <+daedazrael> Maybe if Versus 13 had actually come out
[1:24:21] <choocheess> that's a cool set piece
[1:24:21] <chrishansen69_> Icewind dale was done well for an action rpg too
[1:24:23] <Vikingincognito> "Fucks ass"?
[1:24:23] <SaltyAzteca> 1000 heartless battle? Yes please
[1:24:23] <Daxalog> Dssidia was neat?
[1:24:24] <+ScreamLord> Fucks ass?
[1:24:27] <%jackelzxaa> whats weird about the boop is that even that boop would hurt like fucking hell to get hit by a gun and a big metal fist
[1:24:31] <jorniev> KH2 was soo goot it took them a while to get back to that
[1:24:37] <+FennecZephyr> Hey anal sex rocks
[1:24:37] <peachy996> Neatest Room in the DLC
[1:24:38] <%crimsonharvest> This garbage is based on Aurora same as Dragon Age 1 right? no wonder its so jank
[1:24:38] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> I literally played kh2 today lol
[1:24:38] <%AncelDeLambert> god, Kingdom Hearts. Good combat, terrible everything else
[1:24:40] <stantheman_97> "fucks ass" is definitely an expression
[1:24:44] <%RetroCop87> Square's Fullmetal Alchemist games on PS2 were secretly Kingdom Hearts lite
[1:24:45] <Vikingincognito> Pat Shockwave people off into space
[1:24:48] <+MidnightBurst12> kh2 is one of the best action games of all time imo
[1:24:52] <%jackelzxaa> yep!
[1:24:58] <%jackelzxaa> welcome to the dlc mattering more than me2's main story, pat
[1:25:02] <dd44dostivei> feels like jabba's palace
[1:25:02] <%ainzhelm> but the raepers
[1:25:03] <%AncelDeLambert> too bad they do with him what they do... man I hate the idea behind the Shadow Broker
[1:25:05] <+DatAsuna> the best thing about the ME3 melee upgrade is that the heavy melee is class specific, and a ton of the MP characters had unique ones too
[1:25:05] <Virokwet> this dlc is good
[1:25:08] <Profmcstevie> KH2 was so fucking cool and powerful the plot had to nerf him or he'd be way too good
[1:25:10] <James_Quivers> Same with Arrival, which has more Reaper content than the rest of this game lol
[1:25:11] <+SmartAssPawn089> KH2 makes me cry with how good it is, gameplay, music, nostalgia factor
[1:25:12] <%jackelzxaa> just wait till you get to arrival
[1:25:16] <Aiutare47> Yep. It’s also got a strange difficulty spike in it
[1:25:20] <%bread_assassin> Well, he was established in ME1 but he wasn't really a threat.
[1:25:21] <secret_npc> You could say it's like the Minerva's Den of ME2
[1:25:21] <%andrewofbob> If Shepherd dies in ME2, would 3 default to Refuse ending thanks to Liara?
[1:25:22] <+CyanDeadEye> Remember that Admiral Kohoku mission where the Shadow Broker Agent said the SB would owe you one?
[1:25:24] <peachy996> I think the idea behind the Shadow Broker is just fine
[1:25:25] <%jackelzxaa> the collectors literally don't matter in the grand scheme of things
[1:25:30] <%jackelzxaa> me2 was just a filler arc
[1:25:36] <DSD24> @DatAsuna The Infiltrator Heavy Melee looks so cool!
[1:25:39] <peachy996> I never expected what we got and was satisfied with the reveal
[1:25:41] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> BULLIED
[1:25:43] <James_Quivers> Bioware realized this game didn't move the plot forward so made a bunch of DLC for that purpose
[1:25:44] <+ScreamLord> Geth Shotgun can be charged
[1:25:47] <SaltyAzteca> Biotic ARM
[1:25:49] <%jackelzxaa> if not for the dlc there would be nothing of consiquence to happen during all of me2
[1:25:57] <%AncelDeLambert> he's just a Hyper Krogan
[1:25:59] <GuyverTypeL> me2 is basically filler
[1:26:06] <secret_npc> Evicerator Shotgun the best
[1:26:07] <%AncelDeLambert> he's a Krogan set to 11
[1:26:13] <peachy996> I just wish they put Tazzik in as like a Subboss you had to fight before you reached the Broker's Room
[1:26:13] <%Ipsenscastle> LUL
[1:26:15] <Vikingincognito> ME2 is still the best game in the series
[1:26:15] <%Ranryu692> wait until you meet the Geth Plasma SMG
[1:26:16] <Gelphaze> YES!
[1:26:19] <SaltyAzteca> CRITICAL MISSION FAILURE :(
[1:26:20] <shotgang86> look at his arms
[1:26:22] <athuramn> and then you ragdolled into oblivion
[1:26:29] <%Piemono> I feel like working on the Shadow Broker's super secret ship is a death sentence, cause there's no way he'll let you quit and live
[1:26:31] <%Ranryu692> @Vikingincognito *worst
[1:26:38] <choocheess> try to not eat rockets
[1:26:47] <Vikingincognito> @Vikingincognito *best
[1:26:50] <%andrewofbob> Is the Geth Javelin available in SP?
[1:26:54] <%ainzhelm> Would you call it filler if its just mainly introducing and fleshing out characters?
[1:26:54] <+ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Geth Shotty has a charge up function for BIG Damage. Arguable hits harder than the Claymore
[1:26:59] <+Shady_Zaku> Ragdolling off the side of the ship lol
[1:26:59] <Profmcstevie> Quit and leave? How DO we leave, we're in the only safe part of the entire planet
[1:27:37] <James_Quivers> He's raging
[1:27:39] <GuyverTypeL> Shadow broker pays me really good my family is happy Im not leaving him
[1:27:44] <%Piemono> @Profmcstevie That's just another thing to keep in mind
[1:27:46] <yourliteraldog> boop
[1:27:47] <peachy996> He's too busy brokering shadows to be mad
[1:27:48] <+ScreamLord> It also has way more range and accuracy. Geth SHotty is almost like a rifle
[1:27:50] <choocheess> you snapped her tibia
[1:27:51] <chrishansen69_> This mass effect business affected the masses.. but then the masses gained creative directorship and turned it into an camel with one hump too many, posing as a horse
[1:27:53] <Vikingincognito> Shadow
[1:27:56] <%jackelzxaa> remember: the only way you were able to track down the shadow broker is cerberus sent you an email saying they had a nondescript clue to pass on to liara
[1:27:59] <%AncelDeLambert> how does he have SO MANY agents? How is this place ever kept a secret with this many people on it in just a security role?
[1:28:04] <%strakillias> Wow this secret base has a shit load of dudes on it
[1:28:09] <peachy996> He's legit doing business right now
[1:28:19] <Vikingincognito> Shadow Borker give a great healthcare plan
[1:28:20] <TrollKing96> @ainzhelm If it's not moving the main plot forward, people will count it as filler.
[1:28:24] <%jackelzxaa> that's not a plot thing it's just funny how the dlc email is just nothing
[1:28:24] <%AncelDeLambert> for a SECRET base, this place sure is known to a lot of grunts
[1:28:35] <DSD24> Wow I love spawn holes enemies come out of
[1:28:36] <choocheess> he's busy shadowborking
[1:28:39] <yourliteraldog> Shadow Boker is a job creator

[1:28:53] <James_Quivers> I'm doing Shadow the Hedgehog
[1:28:53] <peachy996> He's getting one last look at intergalactic porn
[1:28:56] <%alternative_flu> what if the shadow broker was a neck beard
[1:28:58] <jorniev> I CANT DIE YET IM TOO BUSY
[1:29:01] <%Monkeyweed21> Shin Hedge Fund Manager
[1:29:02] <%jackelzxaa> does the shadow broker refer to his bedroom as The Shadow Realm?
[1:29:13] <%alternative_flu> use pull on em

[1:31:09] <Jaysky> Get tested for Blussy Disease
[1:31:11] <%Cykron> LUL
[1:31:16] <%AncelDeLambert> booooo
[1:31:16] <%BlackStarAura> THERE’S NO TIME
[1:31:18] <SaltyAzteca> AH!
[1:31:18] <peachy996> I'm sure you are riddled with vd
[1:31:22] <%JoshManVGH> There it is!
[1:31:22] <choocheess> this is just space amazon and shadow bezos
[1:31:23] <%AncelDeLambert> BOOOOOO!
[1:31:29] <+DatAsuna> my favourite joke
[1:31:30] <peachy996> your shep that is
[1:31:33] <Jmann1892> Omnigel was soo good
[1:31:34] <+CyanDeadEye> Ha Ha Meta commentary
[1:31:37] <Alzero83> Remember the thing!!!!
[1:31:41] <jorniev> SHADOW BEZOS
[1:31:41] <James_Quivers> "Liara remember how dumbs ME1 was? Good times."
[1:31:43] <Alzero83> I Member!!
[1:31:50] <Vikingincognito> Seriously, what is the explanation for Asari leaving half their head uncovered in outer space?
[1:31:55] <Mattais88> Wouldn't space Bezos just be normal bezos now, becasue of the rockets?
[1:31:57] <%AncelDeLambert> meta commentary was a mistake
[1:31:59] <Vikingincognito> Do they have superman like skin?
[1:32:03] <+DatAsuna> andromeda is super weird because they somehow left at a time where they had to use thermal clips but still had omnigel
[1:32:06] <Minorou> isn't it weird that non-thermal clip guns were almost erased from existence
[1:32:11] <%JoshManVGH> "Man, people being able to rub goo on computers and get Admin access is a REAL problem!
[1:32:13] <Latija> this mission has more effort put into it than like 65% of the base game
[1:32:13] <%Romuken> So does Tali have HIV cause she gets sick after the fuckin'?
[1:32:14] <DSD24> I love all this talk
[1:32:17] <Dunmarkh> @Vikingincognito Asari are just built different
[1:32:23] <%toolofparanoia> i forgot how good the banter was in SB
[1:32:27] <%HaroldDonchee> their banter is like so much better in this
[1:32:29] <DSD24> @Romuken Nah she just had a nasty cough
[1:32:33] <peachy996> @Vikingincognito It's not just Asari, ME2 made curious decisions on some character masks in space
[1:32:34] <%AncelDeLambert> that was weird... Tali tried to do her drone line twice, but got shot each time interrupting it
[1:32:36] <choocheess> jeez this shit's a guantlet
[1:32:36] <James_Quivers> @Minorou They had a very successful gun buyback program
[1:32:39] <%Romuken> hmmmmmmmmmmmm
[1:32:39] <+DatAsuna> @Minorou yeah except for the ONE antique in Me3
[1:32:44] <Dunmarkh> @Romuken She can't get a shittier immune system.
[1:32:45] <%Romuken> @DSD24 HMMMMMMMMMMMM
[1:32:48] <quipquest1> They’re doing the thing that Citadel did TOO MUCH.
[1:32:53] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god it happened again
[1:32:59] <chrishansen69_> Go for the offense boo, go for the offense
[1:33:03] <peachy996> I remember Jack, Samara, Miranda and Mordin have space masks rather than actual helmets
[1:33:05] <%jackelzxaa> me3 actually does good banther but its because they spent more money recording dialog for a smaller group than me2 had
[1:33:07] <GuyverTypeL> ahshf
[1:33:10] <Vikingincognito> @quipquest1 nah Citadel was great
[1:33:12] <Alzero83> eep dreaming , Bitch!
[1:33:14] <GuyverTypeL> sorry
[1:33:16] <%bread_assassin> I love when characters comment on gameplay mechanics like that.
[1:33:23] <peachy996> There's more but those were the ones that always bugged me
[1:33:25] <dd44dostivei> can tell that this pointed to a lot of what they WANTED ME3 to be
[1:33:26] <+Shady_Zaku> lol Minsk n boo
[1:33:28] <DSD24> Citadel was fun gameplay wise too
[1:33:30] <%alternative_flu> I like using pull on the grunts and watching them fly away
[1:33:34] <SaltyAzteca> ZZZZAP
[1:33:38] <+anokokujin> Are ya hyped for the Nier mobile game or nah?
[1:33:42] <Alzero83> the DLC was awesome, they put a lot of work into them
[1:33:45] <%AncelDeLambert> Pull and Push rule so much
[1:33:51] <%Romuken> Also did I understand her explanation right? Her immune system usually just adapts and becomes super-immune to all bs, but cause she lives in a sterilized space box, it can't do it's thing so they get sick all the time?
[1:33:52] <%jackelzxaa> the squad got more budget in me3 than the main story got. the in mission and out of missions dialogs are so much more elaborate than anything else in the series
[1:33:55] <GustauveVIII> You can beat the final encounter of the Shadow Broker DLC with ONLY BIOTIC CHARGE AND MELEE and it EVEN WORKS ON INSANITY.
[1:33:55] <+Shady_Zaku> LIARA DOIN SPINS
[1:34:01] <%jackelzxaa> AND they go above and beyond in the dlc's with them too
[1:34:02] <RaidenRising> gacha ? nah
[1:34:08] <%jackelzxaa> get ready for cool time
[1:34:11] <+unhuggable1> wait if you have no missions left how do you collect all the deliveries
[1:34:12] <%ainzhelm> THE COOL MUSIC IS BACK
[1:34:14] <%MistyMntns> yes
[1:34:16] <Gelphaze> ***
[1:34:17] <%jackelzxaa> mass effect is SO COOL
[1:34:37] <GuyverTypeL> Using rockets inside the ship? hmmmm
[1:34:41] <%HaroldDonchee> that rocket launch looked shitty
[1:34:47] <DSD24> @Romuken In ME3 Tali talks about how her suit system acclimatized to Shepard so she doesn't get as sick when they are together
[1:34:47] <choocheess> LUL the one guy talking to the drone
[1:34:52] <Xenodile> @Romuken More or less, yeah. Quarian refusal to settle a new planet has damaged their adaptive immune system.
[1:34:52] <SaltyAzteca> Ate that rocket to the face
[1:34:57] <SaltyAzteca> Still pushes
[1:35:07] <ezlo_86> they buffed the melee so much in 2
[1:35:10] <choocheess> don't die
[1:35:18] <%Rumbutt> remember in ME1 when the Shadow Broker totally helped you out? Good times
[1:35:20] <ezlo_86> Shepard punches like the Doomslayer in this one
[1:35:23] <chrishansen69_> Irenicus approves of this
[1:35:27] <peachy996> Lex Luger Elbos
[1:35:33] <+Shady_Zaku> BIP BOOP BAP!
[1:35:34] <Alzero83> Get Booped!
[1:35:37] <+ThomasOfTroy> Jesus christ, this ship is way too small to keep all these goons housed, fed, supplied, etc. Like god damn
[1:35:41] <lloyddboy> THAT'S VANGUARD BABEY!!!!
[1:35:42] <+tinytinykittycat> the boopster
[1:35:51] <%jackelzxaa> @Romuken The problem is VIABLE planets that don't already have claims
[1:35:51] <%Romuken> Interesting, thank you.
[1:36:04] <%UncleAWOL> Vanguard in this game is fucking wild
[1:36:09] <%Romuken> But the Geth are just holding the planets hostage
[1:36:10] <choocheess> Shepherd
[1:36:11] <%jackelzxaa> also because the quarains were exiled from the citadel for creating the geth they aren't able to acquire colonization rights easily
[1:36:16] <DSD24> Man Patshep is just cutting through these doods
[1:36:18] <%strakillias> that red door is progress
[1:36:20] <GuyverTypeL> The booping reminds me of that video of a guy slapping people at a birthday party
[1:36:33] <peachy996> Speaking of Quarian and settling, I'm surprised the Drell never settled anywhere.
[1:36:45] <%Romuken> Me: Just go home. Geth: Yeah come back. Quarians: NO F U THO
[1:36:48] <%Ipsenscastle> he's wearing the only drell coat
[1:36:50] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Romuken The Geth are holding the planets hostage because the Quarians tried to exterminate them.
[1:36:51] <chrishansen69_> Pat overleveled again
[1:36:52] <RedPlasticCup> the only drell outfit

[1:37:13] <peachy996> Fate Worse than Death

[3:08:16] <%Ranryu692> at least it's funny somewhere
[3:08:16] <$lotharrio> Wait is the reason Pat likes Tali, is that Tali's species is constantly cleaning themselves?
[3:08:16] <mangaman8000> Has he read the emails?!?!

[3:10:48] <Darkfire346> If Krogans had a big dick daddy, thatd be the Yahg
[3:10:50] <orphancrippler_> but can he see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch?
[3:10:54] <cooldude69xx> Weakness: Punching a lot
[3:10:57] <+senfood> The Yahg are literal superhumans.
[3:11:05] <peachy996> Wouldn't it be cool if the Salarians uplifted them like the Krogan?
[3:11:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> drain the puppo
[3:11:21] <peachy996> Sounds like a good idea against the reapers r-right?
[3:11:34] <chrishansen69_> senfood, send me food
[3:11:35] <%RealThiele> i mean the yahg could have taken the diplomats tech
[3:11:45] <yourliteraldog> GENOPHAGE ROUND 2
[3:11:50] <%Larry_Q> "Borked his last piss" huh?
[3:11:59] <+senfood> Why did they not have the Yahg fight the Krogans for dominance oh wait I just answered my own question.
[3:12:10] <GuyverTypeL> We sure don't see many Yahgs
[3:12:25] <peachy996> EVERYBODY barring the Turians and the Humans have sketchy ways to deal with the invasion in 3. Which is neat actually
[3:12:29] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @senfood well one can still having meaningful fuck sessions
[3:12:36] <+DatAsuna> "That's the beauty of it, come winter the yahgs all freeze to death" says skinner
[3:12:52] <filialpails> "20th-century earth level technology" is incredibly broad when you think about it, that's anything from 1901 to 2000
[3:12:56] <+senfood> @DatAsuna LUL
[3:12:58] <peachy996> Feels like only the Turians and Humans are like "Hey we gotta fight this or we're all dead"
[3:13:01] <%RealThiele> no mother, thats just the northern lights
[3:13:05] <orphancrippler_> but how many disks do they have? we'll need an expert on this subject wheres plauge?
[3:13:45] <+senfood> Imagine the Krogan problem combined with the Salarian problem. That's the Yahg.
[3:13:51] <GuyverTypeL> "Reapers? at this time of year at this time of day localized entirely within our galaxy?"
[3:13:58] <chrishansen69_> filialpails.. what happened in between
[3:14:03] <+DatAsuna> @filialpails yeah the century that saw the most technological advancement of allt ime lol
[3:14:21] <chrishansen69_> what happened between -10000000000 and 200
[3:14:22] <%RealThiele> 45 minute queue for me to get into 14 woof
[3:14:36] <+senfood> The Yahg. An entire race of aliens on the sigma male grindset.
[3:14:39] <+Ches_Neckbeard> man the asari are dumb. the protheans left them a database to uplift themselves and they just dicked around making sure they maintained economic dominance then got fucked hard by the reapers
[3:14:42] <+DatAsuna> It's a weird analogy to make because while a species could be on par with us in one tech tree it wou;d be weird to for them to actually develop all the same tech in the same order at the same timeframes
[3:15:09] <+DatAsuna> tbf everyone got fucked hard by the reapers
[3:15:22] <%teefpal> @Ches_Neckbeard Not as badly as the Turians, who were ironically the best equipped to handle the reapers
[3:15:28] <chrishansen69_> Ches_Neckbeard, true, but they achieved
[3:15:34] <peachy996> Yeah but the Asari and Salarians go about the invasion like idiots
[3:15:34] <orphancrippler_> lisa:but then won't we just be overrun with krogan Skinner: no thats the beautiful part of it they'll all freeze in the winter
[3:15:52] <stantheman_97> no hole left unfilled by the reapers
[3:15:52] <Vantesla> @senfood If it wasn't for the hyper violent competitive nature. They probably master space flight and be a terror across the galaxy. Given they have the smarts of Salaraian and power of krogans. So if they ever got a bit more stable the Universe be kinda Sol
[3:16:16] <%teefpal> Also weird how the Turians are a military dictatorship and none of this is ever mentioned ingame. We don't even go to the Turian homeworld, just it's moon
[3:16:34] <peachy996> The Salarians have the nerve to lecture you about a Krogan Rebellion resurgence with the Cure, but then they're trying to uplift the Yahg to probably repeat their mistakes
[3:16:50] <peachy996> Only instead of hey Krogan fight the rachni, it's hey Yahg fight the reapers
[3:16:51] <+DatAsuna> @Vantesla Exceptive they're also highly co-operative and unquestioningly submissive to whoever becomes leader, so it's less their violent nature and probably just a matter of time for them to develop spaceflight
[3:16:56] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @teefpal I'd argue the Asari got fucked harder. the Turians were still fighting on palavan the asari homeworld was completely fucked
[3:17:01] <chrishansen69_> dont down play it, we were idiots for milions of years. then we weren for thousands..
[3:17:08] <%TheWinged7> Hey @PatStaresAt did you hear that Activision/Blizzard has hired the same union busters that Amazon is using?
[3:17:11] <akitanito> that's a fast pee
[3:17:13] <+DatAsuna> Liara straight says the Yahg would probably be the dominant galactic species next cycle if the reapers win
[3:17:16] <+senfood> @Vantesla That's a very good point.
[3:17:23] <drownedmaggie> Pat, I'm playing FFXIV now, is HW/ShB story really worth going through this terrible trash writing to get to? Like I'm being told Shadowbringers is worth it, but ARR's story is so bad, how can I believe that?
[3:17:25] <%teefpal> @Vantesla I def remember hearing somewhere in ME3 that the yalhg are the ones most likely to dominate the galaxy post Reaper Extermination
[3:17:31] <+DatAsuna> They're just low tech enough for the reapers to ignore them
[3:17:45] <+DatAsuna> but just high tech enough to be the first into space after the reapers fuck off
[3:17:47] <%AzureGale> What is this Halo music
[3:17:53] <%NopeBadguy> maybe someone should bust their fucking teeth in
[3:17:59] <%RaziWraith> Unionbusters??? for the guys striking at their company? Seems comically evil at this poiint LUL

[3:18:10] <%James_Quivers> WALKING AHNAR
[3:18:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wait they WALK ON THE TENTACLES
[3:18:18] <Vantesla> @peachy996 they d@datasuna they adapt and learn fast. They become submissive to who they pledge, bit like say Krogans clans fighting constantly that stifles much development one would assume
[3:18:20] <SiameseSneeze> nice
[3:18:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> WHAT?
[3:18:20] <Halospaz117> Oh hey, look at this guy who isn't Elias Kellham

[3:18:39] <Laecerelius> YEEEEAH!
[3:18:40] <Xenodile> @drownedmaggie ARR has to spend a lot of time setting up stuff that pays off later. Once you hit level 35 or so they finish worldbuilding and actually start working on the plot.

[3:20:17] <+DatAsuna> @teefpal I have a similar issue with it. They only way they know to make shepard look badass is to make everyone else bad at their jobs so shepard does it for them

[3:21:31] <drownedmaggie> @Xenodile man people are talking about FFXIV like it's One Piece and I should just stick with it, but One Piece didnt start out being some of the worst written crap ive seen in my life
[3:21:34] <%watts121> Samara is super hot in game. Even hotter in cosplay.
[3:21:34] <Vantesla> @silverdevilfish same with Jack LUL

[3:21:42] <thebalticguy1> GOOD DECISION FIREWALKER IS GARBO
[3:21:44] <SaltyAzteca> awwwwwwwww
[3:21:44] <%teefpal> It's not good for streaming
[3:21:44] <GustauveVIII> firewalker just gives you resources . . . .
[3:21:46] <wolfen091> adds nothing to story
[3:21:46] <%James_Quivers> I don't even know if it has any impact one ME3
[3:21:48] <%Solid_Stro> Yay
[3:21:51] <$lotharrio> It's just a platformer or something. I think there's an upgrade with it, though?
[3:21:51] <+senfood> @watts121 THANK YOU
[3:21:51] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> It doesn't suck, it's just very unnecessary
[3:21:53] <%Monkeyweed21> DO 1 FIREWALKER
[3:21:54] <%Solid_Stro> Thank you
[3:21:54] <+DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt you will play firewalker stuff in overlord anyway, so you will understand what you missed anyway
[3:21:55] <+Exicuren> Good choice, firewalker suck
[3:21:57] <GuyverTypeL> But the bootlwg makoooo
[3:21:58] <peachy996> Does it not affect completeion?

[3:22:22] <%teefpal> Yeah, it's a short fun DLC that is utterly unstreamable
[3:22:23] <%toolofparanoia> you need it for the other dlcs some at least
[3:22:25] <peachy996> Firewalker is just 5 Hammerhead missions anyway.
[3:22:25] <Alzero83> Firewalker has no relevance anyways
[3:22:26] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Firewalker gives you literally nothing in ME3 its there just for resources
[3:22:28] <%Monkeyweed21> DO 1 FIREWALKER AND NOTHING ELSE
[3:22:29] <+DatAsuna> leviathan DLC is fun too

[3:27:17] <%James_Quivers> Arrival is alright
[3:27:18] <Vikingincognito> Arival is good fuck yall
[3:27:18] <+Ches_Neckbeard> dude arrival is good
[3:27:19] <+DatAsuna> arrival is super important
[3:27:19] <%ainzhelm> arrival isnt that bad, its just ok
[3:27:20] <%demiiluna> There are no fair trials on Omega
[3:27:23] <Vikingincognito> I love arival
[3:27:23] <peachy996> Yeah and that ties in to more Sucks
[3:27:25] <$Faustgesicht> Arrival pretty important yeah
[3:27:25] <Vantesla> I liked Arrival.
[3:27:26] <%toolofparanoia> Arrival is aight... Hackett is there
[3:27:30] <+DatAsuna> not good, but important
[3:27:33] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I don't know if you've seen it yet, but California has banned High end PC because of the energy consumption bills they passed
[3:27:34] <%Monkeyweed21> arrival is good you kill batarians
[3:27:35] <Aiutare47> It’s fine. A bit weird.
[3:27:39] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat I hope you're ready to whale or be whaled tomorow
[3:27:43] <%mike2hands> WOOA nice
[3:27:48] <SiameseSneeze> Fuck the Batarians!
[3:27:52] <$Futurecity10> california is a shithole
[3:27:53] <%AncelDeLambert> I call bullshit on that
[3:27:54] <%RetroCop87> that seems fake
[3:27:54] <jorniev> AW SHIT
[3:27:54] <%ainzhelm> Arrival is funny because joker appears but says nothing. Clear they didnt get seth green for it
[3:27:54] <%lloyddboy> PREBUILTS ONLY
[3:27:58] <%Ranryu692> that sounds fake
[3:27:59] <KetsuoTaberu> it's more complicated than that @patstaresat
[3:28:01] <%toolofparanoia> All my homies hate Batarians!
[3:28:01] <%teefpal> The PC companies had DECADES to comply
[3:28:01] <+vdalson> thats not exactly true
[3:28:05] <+wizard_of_diamonds> High end as bitminers?
[3:28:05] <BrinstarGardeningSociety> that's oversimplifying things a bit
[3:28:09] <%MidnightBurst12> hmmmm
[3:28:10] <%James_Quivers> Everything California does is shortsighted, fuck that state
[3:28:10] <%AncelDeLambert> I just bought a decent one, and electricity is pretty cheap around here
[3:28:11] <Darkfire346> how do you enforce that?
[3:28:12] <+vdalson> its a ban on prebuilts with bad OEM power supplies
[3:28:14] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> More complicated than that.
[3:28:14] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yes
[3:28:15] <%tank7013> Uhhhhh if that's true then Max has a fuckin' problem
[3:28:17] <%RetroCop87> that was a clickbait message
[3:28:17] <%teefpal> They've been preparing this for years, blame the corps for doing nothing
[3:28:22] <Ravioli_Ronin> Lmao yep, let’s start with PCs and not fucking corporate pollution
[3:28:22] <%barrakuta371> Time to build your own Pcs California
[3:28:23] <+DatAsuna> They haven't banned PCs, that's just dumb twitter gossip
[3:28:24] <wolfen091> not to mention the tech industry out there
[3:28:25] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> high end computers are excempt.
[3:28:28] <+D00msDayDan> that's like punishing the carbon emissions of normal cars
[3:28:31] <%AncelDeLambert> that's MEANINGLESS, big woop
[3:28:33] <jorniev> pk
[3:28:33] <%Ranryu692> that sounds like some right-wing intentional misinterpretation
[3:28:33] <Profmcstevie> Way to read only the headline chat guy
[3:28:34] <+Mr___Pillow> no they didn need gold psu
[3:28:34] <%NitronStreams> People are taking it way out of context
[3:28:40] <%ssjklyco> It's mainly Dell being affected as Dell sells propriatary PSU and motherboards that you can't replace on your own.
[3:28:40] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no they have to buy different PSUs oh no
[3:28:43] <%Monkeyweed21> California has MANY MANY laws that are not really enforced in any capacity
[3:28:46] <Vantesla> California makes many stupid decisions. Much of the forest fires as an example in the North of the State is due in part to political stupidity.
[3:28:49] <+Mr___Pillow> and limited mini ITX
[3:28:52] <%CalderGaming> psa1guy
[3:28:57] <%Archmortal> wouldn't it be cool if they banned cryptofarming, updated the power grid, and made more efficient energy consumption technology in general
[3:29:03] <afronooch> yeah greg
[3:29:03] <%NitronStreams> also its not just california
[3:29:06] <+DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt not only that, the PC stuff only applies to how much power they draw IN SLEEP MODE
[3:29:07] <%RealThiele> ghostcrawler
[3:29:16] <%ainzhelm> Whatever the fuck happened to the 3 state california petition plan two years ago?
[3:29:17] <%RetroCop87> Pat, you gonna gatcha it up now that Nier Reincarnation came out?
[3:29:18] <%teefpal> Wow same shit different day
[3:29:19] <%mike2hands> sounds sus
[3:29:19] <%MidnightBurst12> nice
[3:29:21] <Darkfire346> improve sexism, sexism 2.0
[3:29:21] <ape_hawk> Riot is now also gonna get sued by California, btw
[3:29:21] <jorniev> DID YOU SEE BLIZZARD HIRED AN ANTI UNION COMPANY, THE SAME AMAZON HIRED
[3:29:28] <+Wolfstriker121> what a year sofar 2021
[3:29:30] <digaogrunge> They improved sexism
[3:29:30] <%RealThiele> improve by adding more secretly
[3:29:30] <Profmcstevie> These fuckers go through revolving doors
[3:29:31] <%FemmeAndroid> Yeah, it’s only for hardware that is drawing unnecessary amounts of power in sleep mode.
[3:29:40] <%topendbuzza> topendbuzza subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months, currently on a 16 month streak! I've finally bit the bullet and joined Baldsquad, any advice on looking good bald?
[3:29:47] <+DatAsuna> reincarnation plays bad
[3:29:51] <%Monkeyweed21> I knew Ghostcrawler was an asshole but I never thought it was this bad
[3:29:53] <ape_hawk> haha funny or sad funny?
[3:30:01] <+IHATREID> paige called and said play great ace attorney instead @PatStaresAt
[3:30:02] <%topendbuzza> are not a union
[3:30:04] <Vantesla> @ainzhelm failed it wasn't the first time or only proposal in the last decade +
[3:30:06] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> BET THEY ARE NOW!!
[3:30:17] <HeroToxiko> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid nice
[3:30:19] <Sigma_190_Beta> They probably are now.
[3:30:22] <+Ches_Neckbeard> they're not going to unionize because america is made of stupid people
[3:30:23] <%Maids4lyfe> I would
[3:30:27] <%NitronStreams> GAME DEVS NEED BETTER PROTECTIONS
[3:30:27] <%Monkeyweed21> They need like 30% of the staff to vote for the union
[3:30:31] <Profmcstevie> "Fine have it your way"
[3:30:33] <%RealThiele> tbh theyd rather fire the whole campus than risk a union
[3:30:35] <%topendbuzza> LUL
[3:30:37] <KetsuoTaberu> lol
[3:30:41] <Darkfire346> how good is that cupcake tho

[3:30:52] <%NopeBadguy> I would still eat that cupcake
[3:30:59] <$realm_forge> WHY DO FUCKING SCUMBAGS RUN EVERYTHING ….LIKE LITERALLY EVERYTHING
[3:31:01] <Profmcstevie> The bigger the defense the BETTER THE TANTRUM oh boy I wanna eat that cupcake
[3:31:02] <%IamGrapes> @Darkfire346 good enough to pull a gun at someone
[3:31:05] <%teefpal> Legion is unironically the purest
[3:31:07] <ape_hawk> boy, it sure is a great time to start playing ff14, eso, or gw2!!!
[3:31:08] <DusK_The_Stray> If they didn't threaten me I wouldn't have wanted the stupid cupcake
[3:31:16] <%Vyskus> Is this the pre or post strim
[3:31:20] <drownedmaggie> Pat sell me on FFXIV's story
[3:31:26] <ape_hawk> post
[3:31:26] <%topendbuzza> post
[3:31:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @RealThiele that would be hilariously shortsighted and ruin development on WoW D4 and Overwatch 2 so of course they're gonna do that
[3:31:31] <$SGrim> lots
[3:31:34] <%Vyskus> aw frig
[3:31:35] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Every time for a week so far I've gotten the other one. Not a single Praetorium
[3:31:36] <%RealThiele> SUCH DEVASTATION
[3:31:38] <%teefpal> You mean the trailer?
[3:31:48] <chrishansen69_> drownedmaggie, yeah I can get behind that
[3:31:50] <jorniev> @drownedmaggie KILL GODS ADQUIRE FASHION
[3:31:57] <%RealThiele> @Monkeyweed21 theyll outsource it and it will burn
[3:32:07] <%Treuan> FFXIV: It's not wow, that's all you need right now
[3:32:10] <%AncelDeLambert> the vanilla story puts me to sleep, won't lie
[3:32:13] <+kortin> I will never forget about the time that the meat department of a single walmart tried to unionize and walmart responded by removing the meat department in every store.
[3:32:13] <$KnivesEve> dont forget ff14 is on sale now for $23.99
[3:32:13] <%teefpal> Better than FF7 Remake?
[3:32:15] <%StaceMcGate> but not Lyse
[3:32:17] <Profmcstevie> Final Fantasy with LEG ROOM
[3:32:18] <chrishansen69_> fucking steiner?
[3:32:23] <%Vyskus> Hoary Boulder is the true hero
[3:32:26] <%RealThiele> Alisaie is bae
[3:32:27] <%ElkRiverDog> Think they’ll ever make those cutscenes skippable?
[3:32:28] <%Aeoneth> Just beat Stormblood, but HW is STILL AMAZING
[3:32:29] <Treasure_Vault> How far did you get in Scarlet Nexus? Some of the reveals are ridiculous. I really enjoy it.
[3:32:31] <%AncelDeLambert> no?
[3:32:35] <%Monkeyweed21> Alphinaud is a stupid bitch but he's MY STUPID BITCH
[3:32:37] <ape_hawk> did he 300 the guy?
[3:32:38] <$Faustgesicht> That was was pretty neat
[3:32:38] <jorniev> HUGE ALPHINAUD
[3:32:48] <Vantesla> It's a slow burn game. So if wanting immediate amazement one will be likely disappointed.
[3:32:49] <TioXyco> but he couldn''t do tthat! that's party allies only!
[3:32:50] <%topendbuzza> but do you just standing there watching?
[3:32:53] <%ssjklyco> They could theoreticallly make FFXIV into the literal last Final Fantasy
[3:32:55] <TioXyco> he cheated that rescue
[3:32:57] <i_chevalier> @patstaresat Did you hear about the Dad. Who could believes his son is a crisis actor. His son is one of the kids from the Douglas high school shooting. Cause he believes so hard in fake news, that he believes his own son is a crisis actor!!
[3:32:58] <%Wallabri> Rescue is a tool for Evil
[3:32:58] <chrishansen69_> nah 9 was cheap crap
[3:33:00] <+ThomasOfTroy> Is it possible to play completely solo, without strangers even? Cause not being able to play singleplayer is what kills me on mmos usually
[3:33:09] <%Monkeyweed21> learn to swim Urianger its not that hard
[3:33:09] <%demiiluna> I'm still really salty about Max being told to skip the ARR story, and now all these people in Heavensward are complete strangers he has no reason to care about.
[3:33:15] <%snugglepuggs> When I don’t remember #
[3:33:23] <%Monkeyweed21> you went to college on an island nation FFS

[3:33:36] <%RealThiele> there needs to be a skip to level 30 potion
[3:33:39] <%zeroarturia> By the way Nier Reincarnation is available to download and play
[3:33:40] <%RetroCop87> @i_chevalier what does that have to do with anything?
