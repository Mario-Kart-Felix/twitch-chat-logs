[0:17:19] <@PlagueOfGripes> "we will soon I promise"
[0:17:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> Star Wars was never meant to be "deep". But then after ROTJ they got all pretentious and fucked it up
[0:17:21] <%Spydurman> MANDOLORIAN SO GOOD
[0:17:21] <%Macguffn> Even kinda true with mando, just not as true
[0:17:22] <%dekkitout> Kotow 2, Mando, Clone Wars, powergap, everything else
[0:17:23] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Did you see @PatStaresAt ? Ubisoft is makign the next Star Wars Video Game
[0:17:24] <+eanscrale> Well of course not it's star wars

[0:17:25] <ape_hawk> hi pat, how is life?
[0:17:25] <%ScreamLord> The Lore is way better than all of the movies combined
[0:17:26] <Dumple_Roe> movie wise yeah

[0:17:32] <nivlac_555> all of the eu
[0:17:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Big Empire evil, small resistance with scoundrels
[0:17:34] <%walternatorz> mandalorian is solid, but it may not meet your expectations
[0:17:41] <%Alazull> Star Wars has done nothing with its setting...besides creating its setting?
[0:17:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Mandalorian season 1 is more of a generic space western than Star Wars specifically.
[0:17:41] <+Delenay> season 2 is disney franchises
[0:17:44] <+Doggyperro> Star Wars is trash'
[0:17:46] <Gruhunchously> Kreia is like "I love everything this woman represents, but she's a complet e asshole. I"M an asshole and I think she's an asshole"

[0:17:50] <%dekkitout> Mat Pat and Lockstin did that already
[0:17:50] <%Monkeyweed21> they did in Clone Wars
[0:17:51] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Ubisoft is making a Star Wars
[0:17:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @patstaresat Because of a work-related personal project, I've been looking into how to play Auto Chess. Ever thought about playing trying it yourself? (Dota Auto Chess or Teamfight Tactics)?
[0:17:53] <+Chewygamer> @Doggyperro True
[0:17:56] <+D00msDayDan> 2d clone wars is the only good Star Wars I am DETERMINED to die on this hill
[0:17:57] <%AzureGale> When does Marvel cross over
[0:17:58] <@PlagueOfGripes> it was called revenge of the sith
[0:17:58] <%cafefunk> oh boy more Karen
[0:17:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'm still hoping that JarJar was an elaborate prank
[0:17:58] <leothewhitelion> Mandalorian is Space Cowboys
[0:18:00] <%ScreamLord> I maintain that Jarjar was a secret Sith Lord all along
[0:18:02] <ChungusQuest> I just wanna see an Exar Kun movie where he destroyes an entire star system because he's tired of being chased
[0:18:02] <+DazedCookies> Mando actually shows how the events of the movies effected and traumatized some people
[0:18:08] <+xlxviciousxlx> Palpatine s behind it all tho
[0:18:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's like chess but for nerds
[0:18:13] <%sakeydo> fuck you you fucking Trekie. Lol

[0:18:22] <hamborgini> how about doing theatrical releases of the mr. plinkett reviews instead
[0:18:24] <%AncelDeLambert> it's DOTA but card games but NOT card games
[0:18:24] <@SoFarFetched> "why is it called Auto Chess if there is no Chess Pieces"
[0:18:24] <Gruhunchously> I thought you said auto CHISS
[0:18:25] <%twistedj3ster> is that like auto blow but for titjobs?
[0:18:30] <%StaceMcGate> auto-chess = place units and they fight automatically
[0:18:31] <%doomunderthestairs> Paige is hereeeeee
[0:18:31] <%bevyrage> yeah it's just a 'chess' board
[0:18:35] <%arancet> try the TFT mode in league if you want to see
[0:18:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> Star Wars is 30-some years of nerds justifying two decent movies and a hill of garbage
[0:18:37] <%walternatorz> it's dota set on auto complete
[0:18:38] <+eanscrale> At this point Darth Jarjar would be a godsend

[0:39:13] <aeonicvector> Larian is the closest, and they dont cut it
[0:39:13] <%KishinGrek> bioware is a hollow shell controlled by EA
[0:39:14] <%AkronymCLT> Bye-oware

[0:39:32] <%JumboCrunchies> Oh boy its a Star Wars. How many streams of this has Pat done?
[0:39:33] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Look the only way there could be a good narrative star wars is if an indie dev got a hold of it
[0:39:35] <danielm427> pillars
[0:39:35] <CrypticMochi> No one from old bioware is there anymore right.
[0:39:38] <%twistedj3ster> Yeah you know what, Yakuza could do it
[0:39:43] <%wibbwobbler> an absurdly huge star wars game sounds fine
[0:39:43] <%AzureGale> Star Wars is now Spaceballs
[0:39:44] <moonmintparadise> Yeah I trust Larian to make a good game, not a good story
[0:39:45] <+Tman451> Tman451 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 44 months! 
[0:39:45] <%AncelDeLambert> REALLY hoping that BG3 becomes actually playable, soon

[0:42:45] <justinjones1989> Yeah
[0:42:47] <yourliteraldog> I rember that
[0:42:47] <+CabbyDM> That sounds like Janeway
[0:42:47] <+ThomasOfTroy> It's really not
[0:42:48] <%Jekado> yeah classic Voyager
[0:42:49] <OldManDeckardCain> is it tho
[0:42:49] <ape_hawk> its funny to pat
[0:42:52] <%Macguffn> he's promising, but it's a lie
[0:42:53] <%Bt_Robot> ALSO LOOK IT'S A SPIRIT PENGUIN, LOOK OVER THERE!
[0:42:53] <$realm_forge> Then Jane way had raunchy lizard sex
[0:42:54] <vanderbolt777> Janeway said let's commit more war crimes
[0:42:55] <Torgue_1> Big If
[0:42:56] <%AzureGale> haaaaaaa...?
[0:42:56] <@PlagueOfGripes> Remember when Janeway heard the distance thumping of a single indian drum

[0:43:02] <%KishinGrek> lol yes
[0:43:02] <JayEarly> remember when Harry Kim turned down sex with Seven of Nine
[0:43:03] <sumrand0> Visage had a funnier opening
[0:43:04] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> really need to watch that at some point
[0:43:05] <$RealThiele> Janeway was insane for starfleet but a fun character
[0:43:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> Dude I'd play a StarWars rpg starring Adult Mission Vao
[0:43:07] <+kekkerscrew> You should eat Harry!
[0:43:08] <psidefx> Grease me til im fast as lightening

[0:43:10] <justinjones1989> Women captains amiright
[0:43:12] <%machshop> the worst episode of DS9 is better than the best episode of VOY
[0:43:16] <cureneckbeard> Remember the time Tuvok choked and murdered Neelix
[0:43:18] <%Jhylla81> Or Janeway becoming a lizard person and having a lizard baby
[0:43:18] <jimbop444> his peen
[0:43:21] <+BigDumBeak> hey remember when voyager got duplicated and one of the harry kim's died in space so they just took the spare harry but that means a harry kim corpse is just floating in space
[0:43:22] <OldManDeckardCain> sigh
[0:43:23] <@commanderclaw> She's going to wound that knee at a creek
[0:43:23] <%ShudMirelurk> God Voyager makes me almost want to play EA games.

[0:43:53] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Man I love Star Trek just like I love Star Wars, I like a small amount of good and don't give a fuck about the rest
[0:43:54] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Remmeber when Janeway got that Holodick but then felt bad because she could change it however she wanted with no effort?

[0:58:27] <+reallybigrocks> @GeneralSCPatton If I gotta live in hell world then I want it to be filled with sex demons dammit
[0:58:36] <@PlagueOfGripes> the amount of people that know what jedi are but are still totally sure they'd be able to easily kill one in star wars is absurd
[0:58:42] <DianaTheAscian> good fight
[0:58:44] <%MassConnect> more where that came from
[0:58:48] <scrumbotime> "WE WILL FIGHT YOU AND WIN" and then they die in two seconds LITERALLY
[0:58:52] <@PeachSaliva> @plagueofgripes I could kill a jedi
[0:58:52] <%RetroCop87> wwwaaaaa
[0:59:03] <%Huntercd> Why doesn't Kreia have a sword?
[0:59:04] <%StaceMcGate> Pat may be a tad overleveled
[0:59:04] <DianaTheAscian> what was that???
[0:59:06] <@PlagueOfGripes> with Force Brappo maybe
[0:59:09] <%RaziWraith> @PlagueOfGripes gotta get our exp from someone LUL
[0:59:10] <@commanderclaw> Paige would think lewd thoughts and distract the Jedi
[0:59:12] <%Atomik456> @PlagueOfGripes I mean those clones all managed it

[0:59:13] <@PeachSaliva> @plagueofgripes :(

[0:59:32] <%Bt_Robot> USE A SLUG THROWER TO KILL THE JEDI
[0:59:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> Keep in mind, most Jedi are only so strong. Only a few are Protagonist level. Like I'm pretty sure most competent folk could kill a scrub Jedi
[0:59:41] <@SoFarFetched> you fart on Eli
[0:59:42] <DianaTheAscian> but u are
[0:59:43] <@PlagueOfGripes> Darth Noxious
[0:59:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> To kill a jedi you need to be a Pazaak Rainman like Atton
[0:59:45] <Gruhunchously> This fight gave me a lot of trouble. But I didn't have Force Lighting.
[0:59:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> You both are farty
[0:59:48] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Look a jedi is only as killable as how far up their own ass they are

[0:59:58] <%SvenHolgersson> FART PAIGE EATS HURTY SAND
[1:00:01] <+zeraux_> peach saliva more like fart saliva
[1:00:03] <VirtuaRailith> Paige spends so much of her money on perfunes to cover up for constant farts
[1:00:04] <%SvenHolgersson> SPREAD THE WORD
[1:00:06] <%Ranryu692> that whole household is full of farts
[1:00:11] <+GuilKato> Just blame the Zangief - dogs bonus feature is blaming them for that
[1:00:13] <justinjones1989> Paige leaving poop streaks on the coach
[1:00:25] <psidefx> stink lines
[1:00:33] <+OmegaWeltall> yall mean LUL
[1:00:35] <+kekkerscrew> Plague thats because the average jedi aint shit. We just get to see the ones with protagonist powers
[1:00:36] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Paige, why would you make poop handprints all over the bathroom?
[1:00:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> Man Bao Dur sucks at this level
[1:00:37] <justinjones1989> Coach? yeah thats right
[1:00:41] <%dekkitout> The Jedi Order, or whatever equivalent gets as many reboots and cancelations as Charlee's Angels entries
[1:00:44] <Gruhunchously> You are the most FARTY SMEGHEAD that's I've ever had the displeasure to encounter! HA!

[1:01:03] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Pat are you okay? Have you had a no sleeps?
[1:01:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> @kekkerscrew It's just a matter of Skill, I think. Most people aren't exceptional
[1:01:21] <%twistedj3ster> @scrumbotime It's not a story the Jedi would tell you
[1:01:22] <Gruhunchously> What is the life expectancy of the average Jedi, anyway?
[1:01:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> My roommate argues that Yoda shouldn't even have had a lightsaber in the Prequels. I argue he should, even if he never fought onscreen, because it's a symbol of office and even noncombatants should have one
[1:01:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Like a couple hundred years.
[1:01:41] <Teras_ode> NotLikeThis
[1:01:44] <%thedankestmeeme> more like Pat is very high LOL
[1:01:49] <%Dunmarkh> @Gruhunchously 11 days
[1:01:50] <%dekkitout> @Gruhunchously Depends, how many disgruntled, mal adjusted individuals are in the room?
[1:01:51] <kenny_biff> pew k'pew
[1:01:52] <+GuilKato> you need to mount a WiFi camera on zangief
[1:01:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> @gruhunchously Well, Anakin lowered that average significantly
[1:01:52] <%RaziWraith> Damn Darth Karen must be blind LUL
[1:01:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Most jedi just got stationed on backwater farms helping the locals.
[1:01:59] <%captainpodock> karen is already gray lol
[1:01:59] <+GuilKato> so dog collar view
[1:02:00] <psidefx> Does Pat have the dual wield skill?
[1:02:03] <+reallybigrocks> @Gruhunchously Somewhere between like 40 and 900 apparantly
[1:02:03] <%Alazull> Gonna have to speak to that d20's manager
[1:02:04] <laserbeaming> your BAB is too low
[1:02:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> Actually.....I dunno im torn on whether Yoda kicking ass was bad or good
[1:02:19] <+projectmanatees> So many pews
[1:02:24] <subjectg> Dual wield penalties are very high
[1:02:25] <%captainpodock> murder yay!
[1:02:25] <%HeyEaps> Paige doesn't fart, she's just been so inundated and surrounded by fart gas that she's developed the ability to harness the power of farts the way a jedi can use the force.
[1:02:28] <%StaceMcGate> psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhead
[1:02:31] <+GuilKato> you haven't killed their younglings yet pat
[1:02:32] <Oxybe> You spaced D&D'd the crap out of them
[1:02:36] <+GuilKato> dont stop till the job is done
[1:02:37] <Teras_ode> tfw the literal blind woman misses less than your own character LUL
[1:02:39] <Gruhunchously> I think these guys lost the fight. I dunno.
[1:02:40] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ohh that lightning looks good. Powers mod?
[1:02:53] <%RaziWraith> Karen needs some freakin glasses geezus LUL
[1:02:53] <abelincoln_catpuncher> it would've been cool if Yoda actually used force powers instead of being a moon jumping imp
[1:03:01] <RamenRiderZ> Missing all the attacks like everyone's first Morrowind character
[1:03:23] <%logoth_> I fucking hate bao dur so much
[1:03:24] <%dekkitout> "I learned it by watching you, General"
[1:03:24] <%Maids4lyfe> what happened to his arm
[1:03:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> @abelincoln_catpuncher i mean, the jumping counts as the force
[1:03:38] <%AzureGale> Look at this corpse party
[1:03:42] <laserbeaming> how nice of them
[1:03:44] <%Huntercd> Does that guy have a robit arm?
[1:03:45] <%troxvon_the_lesser> I remember once modding this game getting to this planet and then every single texture was slightly transparent, I was miffed
[1:03:47] <+kekkerscrew> Yoda kicking ass is good. Yoda flipping around and stabbing people is bad
[1:03:54] <%JJCheeker> corpse nothing
[1:03:58] <%PaladinDupre> I made butter cheese garlic noodles
[1:04:04] <%Maids4lyfe> is Bao Dur Watson from that creepy ass Sherlock game?
[1:04:09] <$lotharrio> Darth Karen, what happened? You used to be cool.
[1:04:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> i just wish they didnt make Yoda such a serious and sober dude in the prequels, because i DONT think Lucas was even trying to imply "Yoda goes insane during his 20 years alone on Dagobah"
[1:04:11] <%captainpodock> Has Bao Dur always had a fucked arm? This is the first time I have noticed. Bit then again I haven't played this game in god knows how long.
[1:04:11] <Gruhunchously> Hey, memory is valuable.
[1:04:23] <RamenRiderZ> The actors dont have all day so they just leave their loot in a bag and leave the scene
[1:04:26] <justinjones1989> I want to see your jedi manager
[1:04:28] <+PenmanLupine> looks like he ripped off C3P0's torso and wore it
[1:04:32] <Oxybe> karen will force mind control to meet your manager
[1:04:36] <TourettesPlays> Bionicles Armor PogChamp
[1:04:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @captainpodock That's like, 90% of his character in vanilla.
[1:04:49] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur my man, the kooky yoda was always an act
[1:04:50] <%dekkitout> Rero rero
[1:04:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> Bao Dur should just cruch his enemies with his fucking bare hands, covered in blood and brains like Doomguy
[1:04:59] <Gruhunchously> Echani is just 'Mechanic' with the first and last letter removed.
[1:05:00] <%troxvon_the_lesser> I WILL meet the manager!
[1:05:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> nah it went beyond any act
[1:05:05] <%JJCheeker> My dog licks her butt hole
[1:05:06] <psidefx> But you love him
[1:05:08] <Teras_ode> the top consoomer
[1:05:09] <%captainpodock> He's probably tasting your salty McDonalds skin
[1:05:19] <%MechArch> chosen one!
[1:05:31] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur as soon as luke was srs bout the jedi training yoda dropped it real quick
[1:05:32] <%Alazull> wee woo wee woo it's the sound of da police
[1:05:35] <+GuilKato> but those mines!
[1:05:39] <Gruhunchously> The lighting in the sky is a nice touch.
[1:05:39] <jellssssss20> To be fair, if he licks hard enough, you ARE food
[1:05:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> @subjectg even after Luke knows who he is he's still way more like, "casual" and "silly" or "dramatic" than he was in the Prequels
[1:05:57] <Gruhunchously> In the end we are all Corpse (Nothing)
[1:06:10] <%captainpodock> Bao has a bad case of David Blaine voice, it makes me sleepy every time
[1:06:22] <%Dakuu75> Sir? SIR! I need you to SPEAK UP! it's VERY WINDY HERE
[1:06:23] <%AncelDeLambert> best friend shall help us
[1:06:24] <Meekest> Why does this dude look like a jigsaw puzzle
[1:06:33] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt Pat, you better suck Bao's dick, man, I swear
[1:06:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> @subjectg basically Yoda in the prequels doesnt feel like he'd ever mellow out to OT Yoda. OT Yoda doesnt look like he could have been that same little politician he was just 20 years ago
[1:06:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> "They all had to die, General. The Uchihas all had to die a horrible violent death."
[1:06:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's odd... I'm detecting an aura of bitch coming from the shielded area.
[1:06:51] <%dekkitout> It's like Bao'Dur's a manager Kae'Ryn can always speak to
[1:06:57] <%machshop> this guy sounds like a fan addon
[1:07:01] <%Dakuu75> wow, he really is ASMR man
[1:07:02] <RamenRiderZ> Bao Dur has 100 Speech
[1:07:15] <jellssssss20> Is every character supposed to be this echo-y
[1:07:25] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No
[1:07:27] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[1:07:29] <%Maids4lyfe> it's the force
[1:07:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Bao-Dur's sound mixing is just bad.
[1:07:35] <AnacondaVirtue> No
[1:07:35] <DianaTheAscian> no
[1:07:35] <%king_wragles> Oh, so it's not just me
[1:07:35] <%Alazull> Take a shot
[1:07:37] <%Dakuu75> lies
[1:07:38] <%anticrust> no
[1:07:40] <%king_wragles> Bit of an echo ya
[1:07:40] <walnutcast> no there's no echo
[1:07:40] <alyss988> Like Plague last night
[1:07:40] <Gruhunchously> How the hell is Bao still single? (Aside from the PTSD and anger issues)
[1:07:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's the game not anything on your end.
[1:07:43] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur but think about how yoda didn’t do much of the wacky shit he did upon first landing on dagobah ever since he drops the act. Any act of casualness may just be, y’know, a factor of not being head of the council atm
[1:07:43] <%twistedj3ster> no
[1:07:43] <%spokensun> ITS FINE
[1:07:44] <%dekkitout> Echoes are a reoccurring word in Kotor 2, so...
[1:07:45] <%AncelDeLambert> talk to Kreia
[1:07:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> That's literally the whole point, Echooooo
[1:07:46] <%thedankestmeeme> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[1:07:47] <+tigerstyle96> he is echo man
[1:07:48] <%Dakuu75> woolieONEGUY
[1:07:48] <AncelDeLambert> see if there is
[1:07:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Bao-Dur's voice lines are mixed poorly.
[1:07:53] <%troxvon_the_lesser> I really wish that star wars had thematic consistency other than dark bad light good
[1:07:53] <Teras_ode> aand drink
[1:07:54] <%SvenHolgersson> IS IT THE ONE GUY
[1:07:55] <%bevyrage> psa1guy
[1:07:55] <Gruhunchously> ECHOES
[1:07:56] <+tigerstyle96> hes echo!!!
[1:07:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's the game.
[1:07:56] <%AzureGale> I don't hear an echo
[1:07:57] <%twistedj3ster> there's a line on the side of the audio
[1:07:57] <%Agami23> the duality of man
[1:07:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> no echo
[1:07:58] <rawrmeowxd> No echo?
[1:07:58] <%SvenHolgersson> HELLO ONE GUY
[1:07:59] <%Blank9> I don't hear any echo
[1:07:59] <%JJCheeker> Nothing you can change
[1:07:59] <%Maids4lyfe> it's just the voice recording
[1:07:59] <%Dakuu75> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY psaBig woolieONEGUY
[1:08:00] <RamenRiderZ> Bao Dur's VA had a different mic I think
[1:08:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's literally the game.
[1:08:02] <+Mindtrick_Matt> I think its the zone
[1:08:04] <walnutcast> ITS ONE GUY, MAN
[1:08:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> one guy
[1:08:04] <%slimmixrp> The game's reverb is compressed so you can hear it
[1:08:05] <%machshop> it's only when they talk
[1:08:05] <+Sushi2k> ONE GUY
[1:08:05] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:08:09] <%Maids4lyfe> IT'S NOT A REAL ECHO
[1:08:10] <+theaceclaw> did pat side with czreka or the slug dudes?
[1:08:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Gruhunchously Aww im imagining Bao Dur on a date now, its adorable
[1:08:12] <dinnydanny777> I kind of hear it too but maybe it's supposed to be wind
[1:08:13] <jellssssss20> On BayoDoor at least, sorry to bring it up lol
[1:08:14] <%TheBensonator_> It's only Bao-Dur, and it's not even that bad
[1:08:14] <KaiserMario> "You people"????
[1:08:16] <+RunoEddie> echoes in the force
[1:08:17] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Darth One Guy strikes again
[1:08:19] <psidefx> It's just the games voice lines sometimes
[1:08:20] <%HeyEaps> What kind of pillow does Bao Dur use when he sleeps? Or are those spiky things sticking out of his skull just soft and flexible? Do they get flaccid when he goes to sleep?
[1:08:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Bao-Dur's VA has a noticeably different mic yeah.
[1:08:21] <%dekkitout> You people tajRLY
[1:08:22] <%captainpodock> Pat, Kae'Ryn should only be nice to Bao Dur he's like the manager who is always there
[1:08:23] <%walternatorz> I'm glad Pat said it.
[1:08:23] <%SirGO0SE> it smell smelly too
[1:08:24] <rawrmeowxd> I can hear the smell from here
[1:08:25] <%Dunmarkh> @theaceclaw czerka
[1:08:26] <+projectmanatees> One guy
[1:08:27] <%RaziWraith> woolieONEGUY syndrome
[1:08:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> FortOne
[1:08:30] <ape_hawk> what do you mean, "white people"????
[1:08:31] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur even then, i can believe someone can relax after that long, yeah? Especially in isolation
[1:08:32] <+corrosivePaladin> quit farting so much and your streams wont smell
[1:08:33] <mothraken> yeah echo
[1:08:34] <%Romuken> HOES MAD
[1:08:37] <+mikesapartment> we do too
[1:08:40] <alyss988> Kappa
[1:08:42] <%Romuken> quick everyone HOES MAD
[1:08:43] <%FacetiousAF> YO GRANNY WHAT THE FUCK
[1:08:44] <psidefx> HOES MAD
[1:08:44] <+Sushi2k> The mixing is just bad
[1:08:46] <sendart> Bao just has odd voice acting
[1:08:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> I wish they had enough time to add Mira + Bao Dur romance subplots
[1:08:49] <walnutcast> ????????????????
[1:08:49] <$lotharrio> It's fine
[1:08:50] <+Mindtrick_Matt> I think its the zone
[1:08:50] <%slimmixrp> Since the game audio is so compressed now the game's natural reverb is more pronounced. That's it
[1:08:52] <%FacetiousAF> HOES MAD
[1:08:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's part of the game.
[1:08:52] <%twistedj3ster> yeah but it's fine
[1:08:56] <+arumz> its not bad
[1:08:56] <%Dakuu75> oh shit, really? -because I don't hear an echo.
[1:08:57] <%MassConnect> Pat is right
[1:08:58] <+Mindtrick_Matt> It always sounds like that here
[1:08:59] <%twistedj3ster> it's just a small echo
[1:08:59] <%SvenHolgersson> ONE GUY WAS RIGHT
[1:09:01] <%SvenHolgersson> MOD THEM
[1:09:02] <%twistedj3ster> as a treat
[1:09:04] <Teras_ode> one guy was right?
[1:09:05] <%SvenHolgersson> MOD THEM RIGHT NOW
[1:09:06] <chll0ne> i thought it was part of the game
[1:09:06] <jellssssss20> I wasn’t crazy!!
[1:09:08] <%tyler274> tyler274 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months, currently on a 31 month streak! Pat, can you sum up your thoughts on the sexcapades of Zeus in the greek myths in your own words?
[1:09:09] <%dekkitout> Are you sure that's not the game doing that cause you're in a valley?
[1:09:09] <%JJCheeker> I could barely hear the game volume anyway
[1:09:12] <%SvenHolgersson> Thank you one guy!1
[1:09:14] <%king_wragles> My favorite part of these moments are the people desperate enough for validation they jump on a "one guy" bandwagon on reflex
[1:09:14] <+reallybigrocks> I agree with @slimmixrp @PatStaresAt
[1:09:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Granny Goodness
[1:09:17] <rawrmeowxd> Are those MAGA hats??? lol
[1:09:17] <$lotharrio> You're stuck in here with us, Pat.
[1:09:19] <walnutcast> now we gotta spend 30-45 minutes while pat messes with game and stream settings because of ONE GUY
[1:09:28] <Gruhunchously> Well, it couldn't be more appropriate that this game has *echoes*
[1:09:30] <%troxvon_the_lesser> You have saved us one guy
[1:09:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> Why the fuck did Yoda try to eat a droid he KNOWS?
[1:09:38] <%Bt_Robot> Is it because we are getting both your TV audio and direct game audio?
[1:09:38] <%twistedj3ster> @rawrmeowxd Nope, Persona 5 hats
[1:09:38] <%captainpodock> @sendart reminds me of the lobotomized mages in Dragon Age
[1:09:39] <%JJCheeker> Those are get smoked hats
[1:09:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> even pretending
[1:09:40] <alyss988> NotLikeThis
[1:09:40] <+reallybigrocks> Compression probably making ingame reverb louder @PatStaresAt
[1:09:41] <psidefx> HOES MAD x24
[1:09:41] <%MassConnect> gief hit every keyboard
[1:09:49] <+TatuhSalad> Pat looks like I’d he got into powerlifting he’d be really good at deadlift
[1:09:50] <walnutcast> ITS GOOD NO ECHO
[1:09:50] <%twistedj3ster> ECHO GONE
[1:09:50] <+arumz> its fine
[1:09:50] <+reallybigrocks> Sounds fine
[1:09:51] <psidefx> Better
[1:09:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @LiquidDinosaur Because fuck you
[1:09:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> good
[1:09:52] <%Alazull> More
[1:09:53] <%twistedj3ster> DEFEATED
[1:09:53] <%MassConnect> correct
[1:09:53] <leothewhitelion> Bette
[1:09:53] <$lotharrio> Seemed okay?
[1:09:53] <%AzureGale> Yeah that's fine
[1:09:54] <leothewhitelion> r
[1:09:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> @rawrmeowxd no, get smoked hats
[1:09:55] <%Bt_Robot> Much better
[1:09:58] <rawrmeowxd> Sounds good
[1:09:59] <Teras_ode> sounded better
[1:10:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> The trembling fear is more than I can take
[1:10:01] <alyss988> sipsipDab
[1:10:04] <%JJCheeker> I think it's fine don't worry about it
[1:10:05] <%SvenHolgersson> Let one guy weigh in
[1:10:06] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Why did R2 never talk about any of the prequel stuff ever?
[1:10:08] <chll0ne> better
[1:10:10] <psidefx> Drunk and it sounds better/fine now
[1:10:10] <RamenRiderZ> Check Bao
[1:10:11] <%SvenHolgersson> Where is he
[1:10:14] <+reallybigrocks> TBH the echo was barely noticeable in the first place
[1:10:15] <%Maids4lyfe> psaDab
[1:10:16] <%Alazull> Sounds good
[1:10:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> @troxvon_the_lesser R2s a cunt
[1:10:20] <heartlesshealer> game has loud SFX and normal volume BGM
[1:10:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> When I'm up against the echo in the mirror~
[1:10:26] <%Romuken> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:10:27] <mothraken> talk to bao
[1:10:27] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur act, test of character, you know how it is
[1:10:30] <rawrmeowxd> LOL I thought he had maga hats as a meme
[1:10:33] <%strakillias> pretty sure I've gotten that echo before in game
[1:10:35] <$lotharrio> Oh that's fine.
[1:10:38] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt y is this game an audio nightmare?
[1:10:40] <jellssssss20> Seems better, it was more pronounced on bayoDoor so maybe check him?
[1:10:40] <rawrmeowxd> The echo is gone
[1:10:40] <alroy900> its good
[1:10:41] <%twistedj3ster> it's true, he acknowledged me once
[1:10:42] <%SirGO0SE> Pat has special brap sensitive ears
[1:10:42] <@SoFarFetched> its fine
[1:10:43] <RamenRiderZ> It's good
[1:10:43] <+corrosivePaladin> far better
[1:10:48] <psidefx> Is good
[1:10:49] <Teras_ode> it's good
[1:10:52] <Gruhunchously> It's better
[1:10:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is a guy who had a hour long speel trying to fix a line on the screen
[1:10:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> I missed the end of the Czerka arc last time, how'd it end?
[1:10:58] <jellssssss20> Yeah that’s better!
[1:11:00] <heartlesshealer> they had 12 months to make it
[1:11:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's because they had 14 months to make it.
[1:11:08] <mothraken> perfect
[1:11:12] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie Badly
[1:11:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And this is made worse by the restored content.
[1:11:13] <%Monkeyweed21> ask Woolie for advice
[1:11:14] <+corrosivePaladin> because the devs ignored the QA team telling them sound fucked
[1:11:14] <%dekkitout> Good thinking Bao'Dur
[1:11:14] <mothraken> fixed
[1:11:15] <heartlesshealer> 14* excuse me
[1:11:18] <%ShogunNoonto> wasn't this made in like 2 years
[1:11:21] <+Mindtrick_Matt> Thats a good point
[1:11:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> @subjectg NO I DONT! Im arguing that Yoda in the OT is like, NOT the guy who'd do fun tests of character. We're told he's "wise" but really hes just like, a political operator guy. OT and PT Yoda are a completely different character.
[1:11:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Because a lot of the restored content never got a final audio mixing pass.
[1:11:27] <Gruhunchously> I love this guy so much
[1:11:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> 14 months.
[1:11:31] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Also why did Lukes relatives not be like yo is C3P0 when he showed up, like hey that's that droid we owned before only he's gold
[1:11:31] <jellssssss20> As V would say; “14 months! 14 months!”
[1:11:33] <%AzureGale> Partly metal, partly real
[1:11:36] <%JJCheeker> Can really relate to him
[1:11:36] <+Mindtrick_Matt> If I lost a arm I'd play so many pranks on people with my stub
[1:11:40] <heartlesshealer> but yeah, game was super rushed and they didn't even get enough time to put in the full planned story
[1:11:43] <Teras_ode> Bae Dur
[1:11:44] <Gruhunchously> I...love every character in this game. Pretty much.
[1:11:59] <+reallybigrocks> Audio is always pretty low priority compared to other shit, especially when you don't have a ton of time. I wish more games had really good sound design
[1:12:07] <%Dakuu75> no
[1:12:08] <DianaTheAscian> no
[1:12:08] <%Romuken> dont think so
[1:12:10] <rawrmeowxd> The stream quality looks amazing
[1:12:12] <%Monkeyweed21> no
[1:12:12] <%Maids4lyfe> no
[1:12:13] <%king_wragles> I was asleep at FIVE AM, so I don't nokw
[1:12:14] <heartlesshealer> I wasn't here for bayo
[1:12:16] <%slimmixrp> I dont think so
[1:12:16] <%Agami23> @Mindtrick_Matt thank you, this statement made me choke on my food laughing.
[1:12:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ready for POISON?
[1:12:21] <%dekkitout> @LiquidDinosaur Almost like his character shifted after something happening was a real big deal or whatev
[1:12:22] <RamenRiderZ> Imagine the society where Kotor 2 wasn't rushed
[1:12:24] <%HeyEaps> FART GAS
[1:12:25] <%SirGO0SE> GAS
[1:12:26] <%twistedj3ster> Paige floor!
[1:12:26] <%shruke> who let paige in that room?
[1:12:27] <psidefx> Stinky
[1:12:27] <rawrmeowxd> FART GASSSS
[1:12:28] <%king_wragles> Paige must have left a trap
[1:12:31] <Teras_ode> don't walk into the fart trap
[1:12:32] <+reallybigrocks> Stinky fart vent
[1:12:33] <+thickshield> oh no farts!
[1:12:33] <%Romuken> @PatStaresAt why did you let paige into that room, now there's gas
[1:12:34] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Little did we know 2020 was the beginning of the Era of Error
[1:12:35] <heartlesshealer> I think that's a residual effect from hosting Plague for Peach
[1:12:36] <%Breaknoon> BRAP
[1:12:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh no you guys, it's Darth Paige's farts!
[1:12:39] <%slimmixrp> I recommedn compressing in stages cause one compressor blowing its shit out kinda sucls
[1:12:44] <psidefx> The Stink lights
[1:12:47] <jellssssss20> It’s alright Goblin Dad we understand
[1:12:47] <+plzdodge> Are we still on Namek?
[1:12:48] <rawrmeowxd> It's the Cthulhu fart gas!!!
[1:12:49] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt Eli had an echo during the ds3 stream when u listened with no head phones
[1:12:49] <tanarath> paige left something
[1:12:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dekkitout He got some chairs thrown at him that would just make him angrier.
[1:12:52] <%AgniBrandt> The stink makes Kae'ryn still more ANGERY
[1:12:53] <astrophizz> plague sounded like the wizard of oz
[1:12:55] <Gruhunchously> The stink mines
[1:12:57] <+StevorenoElcamino> The echos are just Pat’s “Crazy Talk” stand powers gone outta control. They’re just fucking with HIM now.
[1:13:10] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur political machinations are just par for the course for clone wars era jedi, it’s a necessity for them to function as diplomats within the republic. With it gone, this leaves room for more mysticism. This is of course watsonian af, but it’s better than resigning myself to some ez weak doylist shit
[1:13:10] <RamenRiderZ> Yeah
[1:13:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> ya
[1:13:15] <+corrosivePaladin> yea still echo on her
[1:13:17] <%ClericOfSparda> yes
[1:13:18] <%arancet> barely
[1:13:20] <%slimmixrp> Yeah isnt that the game reverb being amplified
[1:13:23] <Teras_ode> a bit but they are inside now, does that affect things?
[1:13:23] <heartlesshealer> tiny echo, but yeah
[1:13:23] <%JJCheeker> I watch the VOD and there was an Echo
[1:13:28] <+Local16> Weird. I didn't hear it outside now I hear it when they're inside
[1:13:32] <+reallybigrocks> I mean there's supposed to be echo, it's just that the compressor is making it louder @PatStaresAt
[1:13:32] <jellssssss20> Oh, yeah, it’s quicker now
[1:13:37] <%ShogunNoonto> this gamw was made in 14-16 months
[1:13:46] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Come to the linux side we've got better audio and stability but also that thing you like may or may not work.
[1:13:46] <%slimmixrp> Gone
[1:13:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It really really doesn't matter.
[1:13:50] <heartlesshealer> only echo on "yes"
[1:13:50] <jellssssss20> “Hallway echo”?
[1:13:50] <Teras_ode> yep better
[1:13:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> no echo
[1:13:54] <%slimmixrp> super gone now
[1:14:00] <heartlesshealer> so probably recording thing on game end
[1:14:08] <heartlesshealer> like, built-in
[1:14:08] <+reallybigrocks> It's louder indoors though. I think it's supposed to be a reverb effect on the voice
[1:14:10] <El_GhostV1> The real Sith Lords were the audio issues we encountered along the way
[1:14:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat there WILL be audio issues later you can't do anything about. That shuttle was missing a floor last stream.
[1:14:10] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur and of course, it’s pretty important to test someone like one of two hopes the galaxy has left for jedi
[1:14:11] <Teras_ode> punch boi
[1:14:13] <walnutcast> team echo vs team no echo who would win
[1:14:14] <%SolidusRex> MY ARM, MY ARM, MY ARM
[1:14:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> Just PUNCH it
[1:14:25] <+reallybigrocks> Ya know, for the immershun
[1:14:27] <%SirGO0SE> youd think theyd take the arm off
[1:14:31] <bigboy_baku> Is t the echo cause it’s a dungeon?
[1:14:32] <rawrmeowxd> Punching fixes everything
[1:14:36] <RamenRiderZ> Electronic aaaaaarm
[1:14:37] <heartlesshealer> fight start
[1:14:41] <%troxvon_the_lesser> I can hear the baby snoring
[1:14:44] <%SirGO0SE> GAS
[1:14:44] <%SGrim> PogChamp Today's hero!
[1:14:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> Paige stop farting all over Bao Dur
[1:14:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> he just punched a forcefield
[1:14:49] <rawrmeowxd> The next time the audio starts echoing. Just punch it
[1:14:51] <RamenRiderZ> Big snore
[1:14:52] <%PaladinDupre> Bao Durrrr
[1:14:55] <$lotharrio> He's gotta make his mom proud!
[1:14:57] <El_GhostV1> Woolie like punch
[1:15:02] <%dekkitout> And old koot in the swamp who's actually got his shit together is Campbellian as fuck
[1:15:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You know you have breath masks right Pat?
[1:15:07] <Teras_ode> FeelsBadMan the smell is never gonna come off
[1:15:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Does Pat have a stink fetish?
[1:15:21] <%MassConnect> I honestly can't tell if I'm hearing zangief or myself
[1:15:22] <alyss988> Tree boss
[1:15:27] <jellssssss20> Bowser with a d? Bowder?
[1:15:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> Mystic is the word i needed to think of. Im just saying i wish that PT Yoda had more of a chance cinematically to appear "mystic". Like he shoudl have been more "human. " Maybe it was CGI constraints needing him to just do simple animations like pacing or nodding.
[1:15:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> ignore me
[1:15:32] <%SirGO0SE> he likes the smell :)
[1:15:33] <%Daxalog> I like how this is starting to look like Woolie's shock lvl 3 playthrough
[1:15:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> im being stupid
[1:15:38] <heartlesshealer> fight stop. Time to loot
[1:15:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> You should gib bao those unarmed gloves
[1:15:50] <+reallybigrocks> Deactivate central fart gas system
[1:15:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Ignore the masks like a true Karen
[1:15:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Darth Kae'Ren refuses to wear a mask.
[1:15:54] <rawrmeowxd> Where are the jawas at?
[1:15:55] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Poison is not a fun mechanic in most things I find
[1:15:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Even though it could save her life.
[1:15:59] <%bevyrage> pat please, wear your mask
[1:16:11] <%troxvon_the_lesser> It's usually an inconvience and does nothing but annoy
[1:16:12] <Gruhunchously> Theoretically you could have used a stealth field generator to sneak past hte turrets and disable them with the console.
[1:16:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> What class is Karen?
[1:16:13] <heartlesshealer> just slap the laser door
[1:16:14] <%shurtal> is that gief snoring or game alarm?
[1:16:18] <+reallybigrocks> So stinky
[1:16:22] <$lotharrio> Never stop rapping
[1:16:29] <%SvenHolgersson> You first
[1:16:29] <heartlesshealer> BREAKDANCE AT IT
[1:16:30] <%Dakuu75> wtf is that "hhhrrrrrruuu" noise. is that gief???
[1:16:31] <%twistedj3ster> he kicked it
[1:16:32] <photion> doggo getting kind of loud
[1:16:32] <%spokensun> BRUHZIL
[1:16:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> U STARTED IT
[1:16:38] <rawrmeowxd> Does this game have twilek strip club or nah?
[1:16:40] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur i agree that pt yoda doesn’t really have the chance to do that, but i’d chalk that up to the whole “being the head of a major political force within the republic” and all
[1:16:42] <%Alazull> Can't stop. Won't stop the brap and go!
[1:16:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's Zangief.
[1:16:46] <%shurtal> i blieve it's zangief wheezesnoring
[1:16:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> gief big snore
[1:16:50] <Gruhunchously> Doggo really does sound like an ambient sound effect from the game.
[1:16:50] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Gief be loud snore
[1:16:50] <jellssssss20> I said a hip hop, hippie to the hip hip hop ya don’t stop the rocking
[1:16:53] <%SirGO0SE> the dark side LOVES brapping
[1:16:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> I always liked this level, it's a bit quieter, but straightfoward and super short
[1:17:03] <heartlesshealer> Yeah this game has the twilek dance club where you can be a pimp
[1:17:11] <%troxvon_the_lesser> I hear him snore during the podcast too
[1:17:17] <DublinRage> guys, Pat's just RP'ing as Kae'Ryn and not putting on the mask. That's it. LUL
[1:17:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> @subjectg My probem isnt with the story of his character, solely the execution.
[1:17:25] <%dekkitout> In star wars, no one does magic frat clouds better than night sisters
[1:17:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sirgo0se Force Brap is the darkest power
[1:17:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> but George Lucas has NEVER been good at "characters"
[1:17:36] <%slimmixrp> Isnt bao's arm an ability during combat
[1:17:43] <%Dakuu75> @DublinRage damn it, your right
[1:17:44] <Meekest> FEET
[1:17:52] <Gruhunchously> But it also has that guy. You know...that guy. Not that it'll matter becuase we'll probably be killing him on sight in this playthrough.
[1:17:54] <justinjones1989> Show
[1:17:58] <%troxvon_the_lesser> George Lucas isn't very good period
[1:18:00] <ManfredA> improved dual wield
[1:18:09] <scrublordsamurai> show feat
[1:18:18] <Link232> Is that like, wheezing sound Gief snoring?
[1:18:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Gruhunchously Didn't know you could kill Disciple :D
[1:18:32] <rawrmeowxd> Feet reveal at 100 subs?
[1:18:38] <%arancet> @Link232 yes
[1:18:39] <%dekkitout> Gief doing his Vader impression?
[1:18:43] <justinjones1989> show power
[1:18:44] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur george is great at world building and *designing* the characters. As for writing, leave it to someone else
[1:18:45] <jorniev> what is that noise
[1:18:48] <scrublordsamurai> its paige dieing of mustard infection
[1:18:52] <+gespenst25> all you need is kill
[1:18:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Power Word: Die
[1:18:54] <walnutcast> FORCE C U M
[1:18:55] <%Daxalog> Get kill. For laughs.
[1:18:55] <%Alazull> Force Word: Kill?
[1:18:59] <%harry_macdougall> harry_macdougall subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 4 month streak! one year of sub still don't know what to say
[1:19:00] <heartlesshealer> do you want Kill, or the stepping stones to other powers?
[1:19:00] <%troxvon_the_lesser> KILL
[1:19:00] <%Visorak6> Have you ever been so mad you just killed someone by looking at them
[1:19:03] <%Dakuu75> Darth Gief
[1:19:08] <Gruhunchously> Force Kill
[1:19:12] <heartlesshealer> Kill <3
[1:19:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> Aww no Force Scream? Bummer. Oh well.
[1:19:14] <RamenRiderZ> KEEL
[1:19:16] <$lotharrio> Man, what a good Jedi character you have there.
[1:19:16] <LeafarOz> Kotor time pog
[1:19:18] <%captainpodock> Has Gief ever snored so loud or has woken you up Pat?
[1:19:25] <heartlesshealer> Force Scream later
[1:19:31] <walnutcast> i identify as Force Kin uWu
[1:19:33] <%Dunmarkh> I'LL KILL YOU
[1:19:33] <Gruhunchously> Yeah there's another power that Destroys Droids. I can't remember what it's called though...
[1:19:36] <%Dakuu75> @GarbageQueenEllie is that a thing?
[1:19:37] <+xlxviciousxlx> this game does have alot of Droid fights iirc
[1:19:39] <DublinRage> @Dakuu75 more like "General Gief-ous"
[1:19:42] <+troxvon_the_lesser> Man the Jedi and sith have no creativity with the force
[1:19:50] <rawrmeowxd> Are you using nagatamas?
[1:20:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Dakuu75 Killing Disciple or Force Screm?
[1:20:04] <%Monkeyweed21> zappies are clappies
[1:20:05] <heartlesshealer> is because of this right here!
[1:20:07] <CloniiCory> Good play through or not, nothing stops me from using Force Lightning tbh. It's so good.
[1:20:07] <Gruhunchously> Oh hey, didn't see you there.
[1:20:13] <%SvenHolgersson> Was it cuz you love Zapping?
[1:20:16] <Kain5707> why does she have a blaster LUL
[1:20:27] <%Dakuu75> @GarbageQueenEllie force scream~
[1:20:30] <subjectg> force lightning in every game that lets you have it
[1:20:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> @subjectg I'm reading that comic adaptation of the OG Star Wars script treatment , with Annikin Starkiller etc., and the thing i notice most is "the dialogue and characters suck" and hey, the writing IS George Lucas'
[1:20:34] <heartlesshealer> grandma got a gun
[1:20:40] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie You can't kill the Deisciple, but you CAN Force Choke him if he starts giving you sass.
[1:20:41] <Kain5707> god pat yes it does
[1:20:42] <Laecerelius> Krea, learn better buffs so that I may become stronger
[1:20:42] <Javi9563> @Gruhunchously stun/disable/destroy droid, lightside power
[1:20:43] <%dekkitout> Dunno bout that, Nihilus' origin is pretty wild by Sith standards
[1:20:50] <jellssssss20> Imagine just dying to a Jedi having looked at you and used “kill”
[1:20:51] <RamenRiderZ> Stop or Ma will shoot
[1:20:57] <%baka_sugoi> FEET
[1:21:02] <jellssssss20> Do real Jedi have mana bars?
[1:21:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Dakuu75 Hell yea, it's Metal as fuuuck. Not quite as strong as Kill, but fun to watch. I'd always give it to Kreia or Bao
[1:21:05] <photion> these dog snores...
[1:21:06] <heartlesshealer> Pat, by enabling her to attack from long range, her AI is less incentivized to use her force powers probably
[1:21:13] <%tortugatime214> Bring back Star Wars Galaxies. Amirite?
[1:21:13] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur even harrison ford said something to the effect of “you can write this shit george but you can’t say it”
[1:21:14] <%Daxalog> Is that the dog?
[1:21:14] <%Monkeyweed21> more like super power toughness
[1:21:16] <jorniev> IS THAT GIEF?
[1:21:18] <%shurtal> Pat's got his own space alarm on his couch
[1:21:26] <notsoy> is that an alarm, or zangief snoring?
[1:21:30] <$RealThiele> fucking toughness ewwww
[1:21:33] <%Daxalog> Or is it a star wars noise?
[1:21:35] <%machshop> ooooooOOOOOOO
[1:21:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah that's not true at all.
[1:21:36] <mike2hands> yes that boy is snoring
[1:21:39] <leothewhitelion> GIEF BIG SNORE
[1:21:40] <heartlesshealer> thank you for debunking argument I presented <3
[1:21:42] <@commanderclaw> Zangief's snores sounds like a quiet Klaxon
[1:21:44] <jorniev> ooooooOOOOOOOO
[1:21:47] <%SirGO0SE> Zangief has gone to RED ALERT
[1:21:48] <ToneBacas> Zangief is gonna lift off
[1:21:49] <photion> SNOOOOOOORE
[1:21:52] <Gruhunchously> Listen to that doggo snore
[1:21:57] <scrublordsamurai> is she set to jedi support?
[1:22:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dekkitout So before Malachor 5 was he just a rando Jedi who happened to have the same force-social-vampirism disease you do?
[1:22:06] <photion> ooooooOOOOOOOO
[1:22:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes
[1:22:11] <%troxvon_the_lesser> The force is as busted as ever in Kotor 2, honestly I've always preferred the lightsaber go burr way, but I always pick up force lighting for zapp
[1:22:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @LiquidDinosaur No
[1:22:19] <rawrmeowxd> EXPLOIT
[1:22:22] <jorniev> ooooooooOOOOOOO
[1:22:24] <%AzureGale> GE REKT
[1:22:25] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's not how it works.
[1:22:29] <Gruhunchously> Bao uses his arm to disable force fields, which is why he just roundhouse kicks them instead.
[1:22:32] <%captainpodock> Can you prevent her from going nuts with her powers by changing her scripting?
[1:22:35] <heartlesshealer> Stream of damage hell yeah
[1:22:47] <rawrmeowxd> PogChamp
[1:22:49] <scrublordsamurai> yes
[1:23:11] <jellssssss20> Yeah go change the AI scripting lmao
[1:23:14] <+Gamblor69> Dont sweat it dude
[1:23:15] <Gruhunchously> In Woolie's game, he got to the point where we was wiping out entire groups of enemies in one attack with Force Strom. And he was light side.
[1:23:19] <photion> how about the dog snoring?
[1:23:19] <%spokensun> ALL GOOD MAN
[1:23:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> Lol, the founder of Pirate Bay is dunking on Parler. And my dad is questioning how I know about Pirate Bay, as if it's a big deal LUL
[1:23:20] <heartlesshealer> it's fiiiine, we know you're trying
[1:23:25] <%Visorak6> Its okay pat the fact you care enough to fine tune it is appreciated a lot
[1:23:30] <%twistedj3ster> we understand, the game's duct-taped together
[1:23:32] <Noogiez> assloops
[1:23:33] <%Daxalog> Gief is charging up
[1:23:34] <%MidnightBurst12> the game is held together by chewed gum and dreams
[1:23:34] <rawrmeowxd> Ok. I'm kinda a troll, but you legit have one of the best looking streams I've seen
[1:23:36] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Reminds me of my nightmares of getting kotor 1 to work at all on a modern pc
[1:23:40] <LeafarOz> kick the door down with your artificial arm
[1:23:44] <+reallybigrocks> Don't worry Pat, ever since the first big audio fiasco it's been basically fine @PatStaresAt
[1:23:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Too_Much_Nukie Wait what? I thought he was another jedi on the battlefield, and then when the MSG kills all those people and the death-wave crashes into your minds, Exile cuts off, and Nihilus "leans in" to the pain.
[1:23:52] <%RetroCop87> anyone in the chat who gets pissed by the audio fixing honestly deserves to get pissed off
[1:23:57] <Gruhunchously> Okay fine then, smartass
[1:23:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Too_Much_Nukie What is his deal
[1:24:00] <abelincoln_catpuncher> ohhhh what happened?? other than parler completely shitting their pants @generalscpatton
[1:24:03] <jellssssss20> Yeah you’ve fixed it @patstaresat
[1:24:08] <heartlesshealer> god I wanna see something stutter-fly in real life like bao-dur's orb in that cutscene
[1:24:11] <Teras_ode> for what it's worth, it's somewhat nice to see I'm not the only one with ocd about really minor sound issues or the color contrast seeming off when I try to play games
[1:24:15] <+transporterthesequel> For a second I thought Geif's big snore was the game's audio for ship alarms.
[1:24:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @LiquidDinosaur The Malachor academy existed before the planet was destroyed. Nihilus, Sion, and Kreia were already sith.
[1:24:32] <%RetroCop87> UHOH STINKY
[1:24:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @LiquidDinosaur He was there, but not as a jedi.
[1:24:40] <ThatGuyThunder> Kick the door
[1:24:44] <rawrmeowxd> Fart gas is the most forbidden sith power
[1:24:44] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur you’re basically correct, judt that nihilus never had the same force affinity that exile has
[1:24:47] <%twistedj3ster> Paige defeated
[1:24:48] <DublinRage> "My punches can take down shields"
[1:24:48] <ThatGuyThunder> Dinosaurs on the floor
[1:24:49] <%dekkitout> Turn off the Paige vents
[1:24:49] <+GuilKato> pat lockers
[1:24:53] <DublinRage> -kicks door
[1:24:53] <Teras_ode> fart has been plugged
[1:24:56] <+GuilKato> you left the lockers in the other room
[1:24:57] <%Dunmarkh> BRAPS ARE CANCELLED
[1:25:02] <AFewGoodTaters> lulupaLurk
[1:25:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And the exile was never hot shit.
[1:25:14] <%MassConnect> I've never *not* turned off the vents so I have no idea how many vents there would have been
[1:25:21] <jellssssss20> Need to get one of those noise suppression things specifically for snoring and not Paige’s this time lol
[1:25:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The Exile was a mediocre jedi but a great military leader and charismatic person.
[1:25:21] <dinnydanny777> @too_much_nukie I thought dialogue kind of implied Nihilus might have been a Jedi before it
[1:25:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Too_Much_Nukie So he was one of those invisible ninjas? They're also not jedi
[1:25:33] <subjectg> Malachor existed before the planet died, but as i understand nihilus and scion found the academy later on
[1:25:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He was a jedi once, but no he wasn't a jedi when Malachor happened.
[1:25:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> @abelincoln_catpuncher He thinks their inability to stay online is embarassing, and they won't host it because PB is pro human rights
[1:25:41] <subjectg> *Trayus academy
[1:25:43] <+Soulsbjorne> is that the dog snoring?
[1:25:54] <+projectmanatees> Yes
[1:25:57] <+Soulsbjorne> AWWW chunky boi
[1:26:03] <rawrmeowxd> I thought the dog was space ambience LOL
[1:26:03] <ygtidal> psaJpeg
[1:26:05] <%Daxalog> Comfort him
[1:26:09] <photion> THANK YOU JESUS
[1:26:12] <abelincoln_catpuncher> BAHAHAHAHAHA that's fantastic xD
[1:26:19] <%troxvon_the_lesser> You know what my most hated modern visual problem is, when you only have AA like 3 or 4 feet away from you and then it just goes away. Feels like old games didn't have that problem as much
[1:26:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> i always thought of the triumverate is being 3 people broken by Malachor 5
[1:26:23] <%dekkitout> I felt the heft in that grunt
[1:26:29] <%RetroCop87> psaDogchamp HHHHHHNNNNGGGGGG psaDogchamp
[1:26:30] <jellssssss20> Those old man grunts though
[1:26:39] <abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah me too ngl lol
[1:26:41] <%TheBensonator_> SPACE GIEF
[1:26:41] <Gruhunchously> We know that Nihilus got the way that he is at the battle of Malachor. We presume that he was a Jedi before then because that makes the most sense.
[1:26:45] <%Daxalog> I thought it was a speeder bike or something
[1:26:45] <heartlesshealer> psaGiefrail
[1:26:49] <+projectmanatees> Dad grunts there
[1:26:49] <subjectg> how could he not have been? If he was there by the same circumstances that lead to the exile, then he was a jedi
[1:26:53] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yes. I'm here to rescue you from the living.
[1:26:58] <%CalderGaming> it really sounded like a swoop bike race
[1:27:00] <RamenRiderZ> Kanawabotaa
[1:27:00] <+GuilKato> Pat upgrade a zangief sleeping space with audio foam
[1:27:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> We dont know what Sion's deal is right?
[1:27:01] <scrublordsamurai> i thought it was the sound of paiges iron lung
[1:27:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He wasn't a jedi during the battle of malachor.
[1:27:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He was already a sith.
[1:27:08] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Kill this guy for existing cause fuck him
[1:27:08] <+MasterDecoder> I didn’t know if it was Paige or Gief
[1:27:10] <abelincoln_catpuncher> KILL
[1:27:14] <jellssssss20> Was the start of that guy Japanese?
[1:27:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Or at least a dark jedi.
[1:27:17] <%CarpeDeezKnuts> Wonder if someone ever made a mod to fix this dude's pathing
[1:27:18] <$manwithboxonhead> This guy.
[1:27:22] <$AlexStreamsaThing> Maclunkey!!!!!
[1:27:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I'LL KILL YOU
[1:27:30] <ape_hawk> john williams, shut up!
[1:27:32] <%AncelDeLambert> honestly, this is better than the alternative
[1:27:32] <rawrmeowxd> LOL Yea just kick the jedi. That'll work XD
[1:27:33] <heartlesshealer> Kill!
[1:27:38] <AdmiralButtloaf> this escort quest is bugged anyway
[1:27:39] <+projectmanatees> Was he sleeping on his belly or back?
[1:27:41] <scrublordsamurai> maclunkey!!!
[1:27:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> and Kreia either already left the Jedi Order OR just went MIA and presumed dead knee deep in mandos
[1:27:42] <Teras_ode> yes
[1:27:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes
[1:27:44] <%Alazull> "Your insane!" says the dead man
[1:27:44] <RamenRiderZ> Self defense!
[1:27:46] <mesamus> yey, now you don't have to suffer like woolie with that escort
[1:27:50] <+PenmanLupine> I like 2
[1:27:53] <Gruhunchously> ONLY THE WEAK SUFFER
[1:27:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> (assuming Arren Kae theory)
[1:28:00] <tanarath> yeah, 25% of total health
[1:28:02] <Gruhunchously> Granny nods in approval.
[1:28:02] <%Cbenson> Cbenson subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[1:28:04] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Spite Follow
[1:28:05] <%dekkitout> Bao'Dur leans to En'Dur
[1:28:05] <rawrmeowxd> Why are you playing as Darth Karen? lol
[1:28:10] <%troxvon_the_lesser> I'll kill you!!! I'll kill everyone until I find THE MANAGER!!!
[1:28:13] <+GuilKato> no! make bao red
[1:28:16] <jellssssss20> Well actually only the strong suffer, the weak die quick and painlessly
[1:28:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @LiquidDinosaur Unfortunately she's not Arren Kae.
[1:28:21] <hamborgini> see, dark side good actually
[1:28:22] <heartlesshealer> an example of who not to be
[1:28:24] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur afaik, scion was a dark jedi on korriban during kotor 1, witness it go to shit, and found malachor and kreia
[1:28:25] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's just a cool coincidence that fits.
[1:28:28] <Gruhunchously> Light later
[1:28:29] <BlindGato> You're so evil they're changing factions
[1:28:30] <%dekkitout> Lawful Fencesitter was Woolie
[1:28:30] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Pat is either Heads or tails
[1:28:31] <%machshop> i'm tired of this worl
[1:28:33] <uncledoodsauce> woolie and v are too weak
[1:28:37] <+PkSilent01> As someone who once owned a Pug, yes it normal for Zangif to snore like that
[1:28:38] <rawrmeowxd> Everyone betray me. I haven't a friend in the world
[1:28:38] <%MidnightBurst12> all evil, all angry
[1:28:41] <+transporterthesequel> ACTUALLY
[1:28:44] <Gruhunchously> Welcome to the SPITE SIDE
[1:28:45] <XelanArdel> they all want to be good out of spite, its great
[1:28:48] <Teras_ode> psykotpatty?
[1:28:53] <CloniiCory> My focus is always to bang Visas, idc about everyone else.
[1:28:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> A Paragon of just how bad it can get
[1:28:55] <%troxvon_the_lesser> I want them to all try to kill you at the end of the game
[1:28:56] <%dekkitout> Yea?
[1:29:01] <ape_hawk> oh fuck
[1:29:04] <jellssssss20> What’s macadamia nuts dude name? Stain!
[1:29:05] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Wollie tries to be true Neutral but ends up neutral evil, everytime
[1:29:05] <$lotharrio> It's slight
[1:29:06] <%RetroCop87> lawful facesitter
[1:29:06] <leothewhitelion> no
[1:29:07] <rawrmeowxd> No echo?
[1:29:08] <+PenmanLupine> no

[1:29:16] <leothewhitelion> No echo
[1:29:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Too_Much_Nukie Bullshit. even if it wasnt intended by Avellone, its like, almost implausible that she isnt the same person
[1:29:17] <+transporterthesequel> No echo!
[1:29:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> I think it's fine
[1:29:20] <AdmiralButtloaf> what echo
[1:29:20] <%goose_attack_almanac> Man Craig is such a bitch
[1:29:21] <leothewhitelion> Sound is fine
[1:29:21] <+PenmanLupine> it sounds fine but there is a slight echo
[1:29:21] <Gruhunchously> It good
[1:29:22] <%king_wragles> You're in a tunnel
[1:29:23] <robotman37> Sounds fine to me
[1:29:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The echo was gone before whatever you did.
[1:29:23] <heartlesshealer> not gooone, but dulled down to insignificance
[1:29:24] <+PenmanLupine> Paige's mic?
[1:29:25] <%dekkitout> Mic was on?
[1:29:25] <jellssssss20> I think it’s gone
[1:29:26] <%LiquidDinosaur> all the shit that matches up
[1:29:26] <tanarath> The echo exists but it's fine
[1:29:28] <%Gogogolem> Yeah you're reducing carbon emission by a shit ton with all the people you're killing.
[1:29:28] <TheHeroAppears> LUL
[1:29:28] <+PenmanLupine> I FUCKING KNEW IT
[1:29:28] <SPidERMan8576> Echo echo

[1:29:46] <rawrmeowxd> Is that paige's stand ability?

[1:30:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Too_Much_Nukie I dont care. the story they wrote was written in such a way that its implied. its an emergent property.
[1:30:19] <heartlesshealer> Paige Defeated

[1:30:25] <chll0ne> its delayed
[1:30:28] <rawrmeowxd> That was Paige's stand ability
[1:30:32] <subjectg> @too_much_nukie without a definitive answer in universe your answer is as good as theirs
[1:30:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> Death of the author
[1:30:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> Why does Kaeryn look normaler from this angle
[1:30:41] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Paige's Stand: Technical Difficulties. Causes issues that have no reason being present in anything she has been a part of.
[1:30:43] <Gruhunchously> I hate being gaslit by myself
[1:30:45] <Badgerconda_> that's literally what's going on.
[1:30:46] <%Daxalog> Does that also explain Plague's mic?
[1:30:47] <$AlexStreamsaThing> Paige big sinky
[1:30:50] <SPidERMan8576> PogChamp these pogchamp suck
[1:30:52] <%spitelite> Is the audio the new line on the screen

[1:30:57] <%AzureGale> very well
[1:30:59] <Paciboyy> very well
[1:31:11] <Teras_ode> dog snores LUL
[1:31:17] <Parapattern> Gaslighting yourself is literally what ADHD feels like
[1:31:21] <Gruhunchously> For some reason, more of Kreia's dialogue was available during this part of the game in the vanilla version, but Restored Content changed it.
[1:31:26] <chll0ne> dog still snore
[1:31:35] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Just get an Audio Splitter Kappa
[1:31:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> I do it for prih-vuh-cee.
[1:31:43] <heartlesshealer> gotta be able to hear each other without delay
[1:31:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @subjectg Their answer is no though lol.
[1:31:51] <butthurtdave> Sorry if you've answered already but are you gonna keep Bao as unarmed tech man or jedi/sith him up?
[1:31:54] <jellssssss20> Ohh
[1:32:05] <rawrmeowxd> Your set up is pretty aesthetic
[1:32:19] <%dekkitout> More peripherals making for more fail points? No.
[1:32:19] <%troxvon_the_lesser> My best friend work with audio shit all the time and it is a nightmare at every level of knowledge
[1:32:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Gruhunchously iirc it's because it let you spoil yourself.
[1:32:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> Not gonna lie: the reason I hate doing Dark Side runs in this game is that i cant take Kreia thinking im a loser and a psychopathic shitbag and a failure
[1:32:27] <$manwithboxonhead> Why use a controller
[1:32:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> I mean, he could easily be a Punch Jedi
[1:32:30] <+Huskylluvr> oh I remember this place. it was pretty fun to kill
[1:32:30] <+mongorific> i remember multiple episodes involving shouting about headphones
[1:32:33] <%shurtal> Bao-dur, fisting expert
[1:32:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He can still be a jedi and be unarmed.
[1:32:35] <Badgerconda_> punch jedi is pretty good.
[1:32:37] <tanarath> give him item
[1:32:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can be a jedi monk.

[1:33:39] <%Daxalog> Your Dark side. I thought Dark side gets hanhar?
[1:33:41] <Meekest> @PatStaresAt Did you mod it so you get Visas instead of the other guy?
[1:33:41] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Will Visas be evil or good?
[1:33:42] <+OnwardEch0> what u can do, do nar shadda early, get Mira as lightside, then go evil and corrupt her
[1:33:42] <laserbeaming> no best boi Disciple?

[1:39:25] <Gruhunchously> @LiquidDinosaur Worse in the sense that the Exile is cogently manipulating and exploiting her, whereas Nihilus is just kind of mindlessly feeding on everything around him.

[1:43:09] <ChungusQuest> hey Pat, did you see that sketch with Seth MacFarlane where George Lucas yells at someone for talking about Mara Jade?
[1:43:10] <%dekkitout> Hindsight: I told you we should not have stopped for ice cream.
[1:43:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> God every HK line is like warm honey milk
[1:43:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> Are you guys READY for Space Griffith???
[1:43:34] <Gruhunchously> @troxvon_the_lesser I really love how all the promotional material has Atris being heroic and battling Nihilus head on. Probably how she imagines herself in her head.
[1:43:37] <RamenRiderZ> Time for ANNOYING RECITATION:
[1:43:38] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur must’ve been trying to blast that door open
[1:43:43] <%twistedj3ster> I forgot the snow place was on Telos!
[1:43:44] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Oh no the floor is black nothing!
[1:43:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> Where did the soldiers in the Peragus turret sequence come from?
[1:43:45] <CloniiCory> @ChungusQuest It was Seth Green. God I love Mara.

[1:44:04] <ChungusQuest> @CloniiCory oh shit, right...wrong Seth
[1:44:06] <heartlesshealer> well, the restored content also wasn't all of the planned content, unfortunately >:
[1:44:06] <conwaybearkiller> what is CM?
[1:44:07] <%AzureGale> Their aircraft seems to get shot down a lot, huh
[1:44:09] <%Daxalog> Oh my god a fire is just there
[1:44:09] <%dekkitout> It is you fault somehow, Atton
[1:44:10] <%king_wragles> I mean, it's not his fault
[1:44:10] <AdmiralButtloaf> good content
[1:44:13] <redrins> thats why its restored content and not fully and seamlessly integrated content Kappa
[1:44:14] <%snow_bush> Just a bit rough.
[1:44:14] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Well yeah, these were cut because they didn't have time to polish a lot of it
[1:44:15] <$manwithboxonhead> Being shot down. Again
[1:44:16] <butthurtdave> Atton crashes more than joseph joestar
[1:44:18] <brunoberserk> time for '' atris did nothing wrong '' LUL
[1:44:18] <%snow_bush> A wee bit
[1:44:19] <CrimsonFox777> So it caught fire before the impact?

[1:44:45] <Gruhunchously> How did they end up OUTSIDE the shuttle?
[1:44:49] <%Daxalog> How did they fly out!?
[1:44:51] <%AzureGale> Why did they fall down on a Mario Party arena
[1:44:52] <ChungusQuest> @CloniiCory Mara Jade might have been the greatest loss from the de-canonization of EU stuff
[1:44:57] <%shurtal> this is about where i stopped when i rented it

[1:45:01] <CloniiCory> @ChungusQuest They are frequent collaborators between Robot Chicken and Family Guy, both of which have Star Wars Specials, all good.
[1:45:02] <Gruhunchously> Did they just end up flying through the windows?
[1:45:03] <%twistedj3ster> they didn;t wear their seatbelts
[1:45:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Gruhunchously Shut up
[1:45:04] <chhdez> Space air bags
[1:45:05] <moonmintparadise> I love how they allways land just outside their ship as if they flew trough the windows

[1:45:07] <Teras_ode> @Gruhunchously no seatbelts Kappa

[1:45:19] <CloniiCory> @ChungusQuest I forever miss Best Girl. Mara was great.
[1:45:24] <%kewlmyc> I love HK
[1:45:27] <Gruhunchously> These guys are the best
[1:45:29] <butthurtdave> This should be your 2 out of 3 HK parts iirc?
[1:45:34] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Atris should have gotten soul destroyed just like the rest of the dirtbag jedi counsel

[1:45:39] <brunoberserk> they are basilcally the team rocket of this game

[1:46:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> If only you had Force Deflect
[1:47:02] <ape_hawk> that just makes karen want to speak to the HK50s manager even MORE!
[1:47:02] <%Daxalog> Is Kreia not in combat?
[1:47:03] <asylumkon> this is one of the harder fights in the game
[1:47:04] <subjectg> they have a feat that lets them do extra damage on crit

[1:47:09] <RamenRiderZ> Systems failing master~

[1:47:34] <Teras_ode> GET THE MANAGER
[1:47:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh no, what a shame
[1:47:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> Why are you their master again
[1:47:41] <%ssjklyco> Demand to see lifes manager, Karen
[1:47:43] <%SirGO0SE> how LUL
[1:47:47] <Paciboyy> just use a ion grenade
[1:47:49] <laserbeaming> should have sent Atton to tank
[1:47:51] <%dekkitout> Kae'Ryn would've had a blast on Mortis with the Father, Daughter, and Son
[1:47:52] <Gruhunchously> It's down to you ATTOn
[1:47:54] <subjectg> How fitting that the only thing to beat Karen was a machine
[1:47:55] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Oh no the evil one is on the ground dieing what a travesty

[1:48:03] <laserbeaming> use drugs?
[1:48:07] <butthurtdave> You may wanna use his level up to heal him
[1:48:08] <$lotharrio> That floor was coming right for him!
[1:48:10] <%Huntercd> She's speaking to the manager in the afterlife
[1:48:13] <%MidnightBurst12> oh ni

[1:48:15] <%logoth_> TIME TO EVEN THE ODDS

[1:48:27] <Nelsukako> never feel a tension like this before
[1:48:27] <subjectg> Sniper shot lowers your defense my dude
[1:48:31] <%MassConnect> if only Reggie would play. he'd use consumables
[1:48:32] <+transporterthesequel> Atton is the hero we all deserve, in the worst possible way
[1:48:32] <%Fooguwu> nice party pat-a-rick
[1:48:33] <RamenRiderZ> More where that came from
[1:48:33] <laserbeaming> Remember Atton always gets up after falling if he has allies. Send him to Tank.
[1:48:42] <$manwithboxonhead> The floor was coming at him.
[1:48:45] <Gruhunchously> I mean, they did even the odds. Balance was restored.

[1:49:02] <%toastybites> the floor was reaching for its gun
[1:49:19] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Consumables are for big bosses only never use them for anything else, hoard that shit like a dragon
[1:49:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:49:36] <Gruhunchously> Might want to heal up unless you want to be winded throughout the next cutscene.
[1:49:51] <laserbeaming> use consumables all the time, the game gives them out like candy
[1:49:53] <Gruhunchously> Which would be hilarious, but might kill the mood.

[1:53:07] <subjectg> wait i thought charles was the one getting mindfucked all the time?
[1:53:14] <Meekest> She literally cant think less of you
[1:53:19] <%Peacockney> Why does Kreia's VA sound so familiar
[1:53:19] <heartlesshealer> so if they were never caught here together, Atton might have fooled her forever
[1:53:19] <+vicar_anat> oh no Atton is a furry
[1:53:21] <%twistedj3ster> He jacks it to Kai Ren in the back of the shuttle
[1:53:23] <RamenRiderZ> Your brain: run by Goblin. Pull him out and BEAT HIM
[1:53:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GOD KREIAS VA IS SO DAMN GOOD
[1:53:27] <+GuilKato> Kay-Ren will care - that Atton can kill more effectively and hasn't been! he needs to bring his A Game to the table
[1:53:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> "Please Kreia, I want to smash"
[1:53:44] <%TheDeceasedJester> Come on death by snu snu by the snow amazons :D
[1:53:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> Maaaan. Kreia molested Atton's brain real bad
[1:53:47] <+GuilKato> is zangeif running in his adoarable sleep!?
[1:53:48] <%Nekros4442> Kreia is so criminally underused in this universe
[1:53:50] <%dekkitout> Do it or imma snitch
[1:53:51] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Karen only cares if Atton can help her get to the manager

[1:54:06] <%AzureGale> DAMN SON
[1:54:08] <%Huntercd> Kreia is a dirty woman wuff

[1:55:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> Kreia is the single best thing in Star Wars
[1:55:06] <%dekkitout> "NGL ya almost had me in the first quarter Atton, but ya narrow ass is mine"
[1:55:07] <+corrosivePaladin> can we kill this old lady? shes going pretty evil here

[1:55:40] <%yoshkosh20> Pat's aiming to be evil. they'll get along swimmingly
[1:55:40] <%baka_sugoi> she tsukiyomied him
[1:55:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Did you know Kreia's voice actress had only done theater before this game? It explains a lot of her cadence and how grandiose her lines feel.
[1:55:47] <%SirGO0SE> she calls him a murderer as if she isnt

[1:59:03] <subjectg> uh oh, missed the big debate
[1:59:05] <CrypticMochi> You know why

[1:59:18] <%twistedj3ster> I thought she stuck the lightsaber into that pillar
[1:59:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah you skipped the whole debate by refusing to speak.
[1:59:20] <rawrmeowxd> Is that another karen???
[1:59:20] <$lotharrio> Live with it.
[1:59:21] <%CatastropheCorvid> She gets all pissy and leaves.

[1:59:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I like that though.
[1:59:47] <$manwithboxonhead> Note to Pat: Being an asshole at certain times will skip Big Lore.
[1:59:48] <%CatastropheCorvid> "The path of the dark side is a short one:.
[1:59:48] <laserbeaming> the last option is always skip
[1:59:49] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Off to go jerk off in the darkside room

[1:59:52] <@commanderclaw> Just like real life
[1:59:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Why the fuck would she debate you if you're being unreasonable.
[1:59:53] <laserbeaming> almost always though
[1:59:53] <%SolidusRex> That's what you get for being a jackass

[2:01:46] <dinnydanny777> I wonder how many people have died from force mind trick chokejerking
[2:01:48] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Force choke jerking is the ultimate cheat to the chokejerk
[2:02:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> @liquiddinosaur But what if nutting makes you snap your own neck?
[2:02:18] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Man I'm sure mindtrick has been used for some fuck up shit
[2:02:22] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt You must understand the way of the Karen; be nice at first to get people to let their guard down, and THEN unleash the raging asshole.
[2:02:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> When Vader killed the younglings at the temple he did it by save scumming
[2:02:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> @GeneralSCPatton That's my OC Sith Lord origin story

[2:03:04] <%MelBrooksKA> @LiquidDinosaur Darth Nut
[2:03:07] <$manwithboxonhead> Save now
[2:03:10] <dinnydanny777> I think Battlefront 2 actually had a kill the younglings mission and it was really hard for some reason
[2:03:10] <+GuilKato> see if you get dialogure about leaving him in the snow
[2:03:24] <laserbeaming> save early save often
[2:03:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> @bettysharkface Honestly i like how the new lore of TORTURED RED CRYSTALS enforces a reason why Bad Guys all use one saber color, because i dont see why they'd all universally do it out of "tradition" to some ancient ass geezers
[2:03:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Force chokejerking is probably the safest way to do it. If you go unconscious, you stop choking yourself, then you just Force Heal away the brain damage caused by oxygen deprivation :)

[2:03:56] <+BachOClock> When I saw the announcement of Lucasfilm Games my only thought was "JUST CALL IT LUCASARTS YOU COWARDS"

[2:04:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> Smooooch theeeemmmmm
[2:04:04] <mesamus> oh yeah battlefront 2 temple jedi, there were jedi everywhere that would kill the reinforcement count really fast
[2:04:13] <Dragovus> KILL THEM ALL!
[2:04:13] <+GuilKato> Atrius is pretty high and mighty considering shes stealing VAST amounts of energy to run that shield over the facility
[2:04:18] <%troxvon_the_lesser> I love speed running my darkside fall on Taris in Kotor 1 cause it's hilarious being so obviously evil when you show up on dantooine. I feel like this game doesn't have the same level of fun in this game
[2:04:25] <@commanderclaw> Just stop being a *dumb* darksider, be a smart one instead
[2:04:31] <subjectg> I cheesed that mission in bf2 with detpacks and mines
[2:04:40] <$manwithboxonhead> Murderer
[2:04:43] <Gruhunchously> @GuilKato That's only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Atris' hypocracy.

[2:06:47] <Gruhunchously> Make sure to ask her about the council's decision at some point
[2:06:48] <Javi9563> you can't make me angry - a person who is absolutely angry
[2:06:49] <Teras_ode> I'm not angry, you're angry!
[2:06:52] <%whyskeywolfe> Wait why does a station need fuel to remain in orbit? That don't make no sense.
[2:06:53] <%dekkitout> psaCrazyhand ... she has a point...
[2:07:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Said the sith
[2:07:15] <dinnydanny777> Scars...?
[2:07:20] <tanarath> he snore
[2:07:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> @whyskeywolfe I mean it needs to make adjustments. Also how much fucking liquid fuel do you need to keep the whole thing up like a helicarrier
[2:07:33] <spectralpants> "I tear my heart open! I sew myself shut!"
[2:07:37] <Gruhunchously> I mean...yeah.

[2:08:00] <%AncelDeLambert> "It's YOU, Outcast! YOU'RE the one who should be in this boat!"
[2:08:01] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur maybe they also had synthetic crystals, and besides, don’t think either of them were hellbent on screwing sith tradition
[2:08:14] <%ssjklyco> "I am the last Jedi, if you ignore the 10 other jedi wondering around"
[2:08:27] <%dekkitout> "From my-"

[2:09:02] <ChungusQuest> "If we let you go, you will lead them to us. We will let you go now."
[2:09:02] <$manwithboxonhead> You were not as much of an asshole but still too much.
[2:09:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's fine.
[2:09:05] <+Mindtrick_Matt> I like how when you are a male Exile its implied Atris and you fucked

[2:09:57] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur sorry
[2:09:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You don't talk to Atris again until the ass end of the game.

[2:11:32] <+Mindtrick_Matt> It is glowing red but shhhh
[2:11:37] <%MassConnect> it's just warm
[2:11:40] <gustavozxd> it's not like Red means evil in the Star Wars universe
[2:11:41] <rawrmeowxd> The duel of Karens
[2:11:41] <Teras_ode> red room of ultimate jedi goodness
[2:11:41] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Woolie had a guy who played this game a ton of times guiding him, Pat hasnt played this in a long time
[2:11:42] <%CatastropheCorvid> The room isn't evil, it's just where all the evil is stored.
[2:11:46] <%SirGO0SE> its her brap chamber
[2:11:46] <Viaquez> its not evil she just has gamer rgb out the ass
[2:11:48] <Gruhunchously> FIRST TWO

[2:14:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> "I pleasure myself with it daily~"
[2:14:17] <Gruhunchously> Only the 'I don't want to talk about this anymore' options skip forward

[2:15:37] <jorniev> OUT KAREN HER
[2:15:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's great
[2:15:44] <%dekkitout> The council is always wrong
[2:15:47] <subjectg> @link232 it is a very nice robe
[2:15:50] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> This is what happens when hippies run a war.
[2:15:50] <jorniev> YES
[2:15:50] <gnarly_memes_bro> are you ready for the next karen?!?!?!
[2:15:52] <KaitlynnHere> Karen vs. Karen
[2:15:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SUPER WRONG
[2:15:57] <%TheMattman1313> Because you fought to defend the Outer Rim, you had to feel things, and therefore you're now EEEVIL
[2:16:07] <%dekkitout> Give it like 3 weeks, the High Republic council is gonna be full of shit
[2:16:09] <jorniev> THE COUNCIL OF THIS ERA WAS THE SHITIEST ONE
[2:16:10] <%troxvon_the_lesser> They we're wrong about everything all the fucking time in everything star wars actually
[2:16:10] <%Mr_Pylon> Council has never been right, they always fuckin suck
[2:16:11] <%Futurecity10> Nope, council was actually wrong
[2:16:13] <Teras_ode> "But the teachings could never be wrong"
[2:16:14] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[2:16:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Revan canonically did nothing wrong
[2:16:20] <+RiddleMeWhat> the Jedi Council keeping up the tradition, wrong for thousands of years
[2:16:21] <+burntbagels13> PEACE IN OUR TIME
[2:16:22] <Gruhunchously> But muh nebulous evil threat on the horizon....
[2:16:24] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Man fuck Chamberland
[2:16:24] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> He's totally going to obey this piece of paper.
[2:16:24] <%Pyr0_Fr0st> Those blue lips remind me of a dead person
[2:16:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The council were right that the jedi going to war would expose them to passions they weren't able to handle. But if the jedi hadn't gone to war the republic _would_ have lose.
[2:16:28] <scrublordsamurai> "peace in our time"
[2:16:33] <subjectg> “The Great Pre-war Joke”
[2:16:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Council is always super arrogant and end up falling because of it
[2:16:37] <%dekkitout> Chamberlain: Nah, Hitler promised he'd stop
[2:16:38] <gustavozxd> wrong but somehow less stupid than the council in the prequels
[2:16:41] <+RiddleMeWhat> The [CRAZY TALK] Council hereby convenes
[2:16:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> Here comes the TEEEEAAA
[2:16:52] <Gruhunchously> God this bitchfest is so great.
[2:16:53] <KaitlynnHere> Council is so arrogant that they know and see everything that’s why they don’t notice shit. Even when you lie to their faces
[2:17:01] <%RaziWraith> Literally the Nuh uh response LUL
[2:17:02] <Gruhunchously> I like option 4
[2:17:03] <$manwithboxonhead> Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[2:17:06] <%juxtest> I lost nothing in the war. Except my fucking Lightsaber after you stole it.
[2:17:08] <%marsproject> marsproject subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 12 month streak! Hey Pat, good to see you playing the best Kotor game, you being all Lightside? Or a sithy Karen? @PatStaresAt
[2:17:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> what was Evil Exile like in exile? They had no Force so were they just mundane curmudgeonly psychos?
[2:17:20] <chhdez> You lost da wae
[2:17:28] <LorcaNomad> yes
[2:17:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Nah the issue isnt that the Jedi went to war, its that only a few of em did. If the council sent all their Jedi, none of the bad shit wouldve happened

[2:21:04] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt If you have high enough awareness you can accuse her of wanting to go to war but being too afraid, and that's why she's so mad.
[2:21:05] <+LegendairyRoast> Pat has goopy goblin gamer brain
[2:21:08] <scrublordsamurai> @legendairyroast his teachings would be called unnatural by the jedi

[2:25:44] <laserbeaming> LUL I love her
[2:25:47] <CloniiCory> Everyone remember how the whole point of Return of the Jedi was that Yoda and Obi-Wan were full of shit, and it was up to Luke to find another way to beat the Sith? Neither did anyone making the new canon lol

[2:38:05] <rawrmeowxd> Not all dogs can talk but bitches can LUL
[2:38:06] <rjhascancer> Woolie is silencing dogs?
[2:38:11] <%greasypete00> or how computers "talk to networks"
[2:38:17] <%wibbwobbler> they understand a thing or two i think
[2:38:21] <%Huntercd> Naked sparing I hope?
[2:38:21] <$RealThiele> woolie moved that goalpost but he did admit and we moved on

[2:39:38] <Gruhunchously> FIGHT FUCK FIGHT FUCK
[2:39:39] <+gaemjurnalist> don't restrain yourself but also restrain yourself
[2:39:40] <subjectg> FINAL DESTINATION
[2:39:40] <KeiPrime> no tiddie twisters
[2:39:42] <+bugz_munny> FLURRY ONLY
[2:39:46] <$manwithboxonhead> Cant see health bar
[2:39:47] <rawrmeowxd> Kill her and just say it was a prank
[2:39:49] <KeiPrime> no indian burns
[2:39:50] <rednecked__crake> miss miss miss
[2:39:50] <%ssjklyco> FISTING technique
[2:39:50] <%ShudMirelurk> SAY YEAAH
[2:39:51] <laserbeaming> did you shoot drugs before doing this?
[2:39:52] <+bugz_munny> yeah these fights are kinda hard?
[2:39:53] <%greasypete00> shes so evasive
[2:39:54] <%baka_sugoi> WIZARD FIGHT
[2:39:55] <scrublordsamurai> KICK THE SHIT OUT OF KAREN!
[2:39:55] <GustauveVIII> PUSH HER OUT OF THE RING
[2:39:55] <%BinaryFireball> bite her
[2:39:57] <%juxtest> Quick Atton shoot her!
[2:39:57] <Gruhunchously> Flurry lowers your defense
[2:39:58] <tubit> wait, her feet left the mat 3 times...
[2:39:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> @subjectg word. that must be the reason. Not wanting to do skin damage textures for your whole body
[2:40:00] <%wibbwobbler> look at em go
[2:40:00] <+VoytekBus> the FEET left the FLOOR
[2:40:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Of course you are, using only flurry is the worst thing you could've done.
[2:40:03] <%Daxalog> is that master flurry? Does it still debuff you hard for using it too much?
[2:40:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Can't you pre-mine the fight?
[2:40:05] <+gaemjurnalist> no wet willies
[2:40:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> That full body jumpsuit is to hide your gross disgusting sith body
[2:40:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Flurry lowers your defense AND accuracy.
[2:40:19] <%AzureGale> THE MOST INTENSE BATTLES
[2:40:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> This is legit the harest fight in the game
[2:40:25] <rawrmeowxd> This dance off has whack music
[2:40:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> hardest*
[2:40:30] <$realm_forge> This is literally smacking 2 action figures together
[2:40:30] <Yakobro> LUL
[2:40:32] <chll0ne> dat ass
[2:40:34] <%YakumoYomi> BODIED
[2:40:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> JUST USE NORMAL FIGHT
[2:40:38] <kenny_biff> you didnt know Kappa
[2:40:39] <%toastybites> this reminds me of fights in Sims
[2:40:40] <GustauveVIII> IF YOU WALK INTO HER YOU CAN PUSH HER OUT OF THE RING
[2:40:40] <+bugz_munny> yeah these fights are brutal
[2:40:41] <asylumkon> critical strike lowers your defense even more
[2:40:43] <Gruhunchously> FIX ME GRANNY
[2:40:44] <$manwithboxonhead> @GeneralSCPatton Woolie playthrough tried it and it dosent work.
[2:40:44] <chll0ne> this shouldve been a twerk off
[2:40:47] <+bugz_munny> and you need to manually heal after too
[2:40:47] <KeiPrime> dropped a heel on your damn head
[2:40:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> reload
[2:40:48] <notsoy> critical strike also lowers your defense too
[2:40:48] <$RealThiele> ILL KILL YOU
[2:40:49] <laserbeaming> shoot drugs and get force buffs before
[2:40:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt All of the melee special attacks have drawbacks. Most lower defense
[2:40:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I think you can pre-buff
[2:40:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> Maybe upgrade your weapons and armor to be op
[2:40:59] <notsoy> power attack does not lower defense iirc
[2:41:02] <subjectg> power strike only lowers to-hit
[2:41:16] <tanarath> @patstaresat Special attacks arent great till later
[2:41:17] <subjectg> normal attack is usually the safest option
[2:41:18] <%SirGO0SE> gotta do drugs
[2:41:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> @garbagequeenellie It's a naked fistfight
[2:41:19] <ExpressNode> Let me dope up on some magic before we fight
[2:41:20] <+bugz_munny> save scuuuuum
[2:41:24] <+bugz_munny> the best darkside power
[2:41:28] <$RealThiele> like in terms of DnD 3.0 Str wins
[2:41:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> @GeneralSCPatton The later fights allow weapons and armor
[2:41:53] <notsoy> goomba stomping each other lmfao
[2:41:54] <+bugz_munny> yeah she;s strong af
[2:41:55] <kenny_biff> doens't power attack also lower defense?
[2:41:56] <%baka_sugoi> STOMP
[2:41:59] <+LegendairyRoast> AMAZING
[2:42:00] <mak0t0yukii> Look at those overheads PogChamp
[2:42:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kangaroo attack!
[2:42:01] <%MechArch> miss
[2:42:02] <Gruhunchously> The white and black is like some anime shit.
[2:42:05] <%Daxalog> Accuracy is now in the gutter
[2:42:08] <%juxtest> Her feet left the mat!
[2:42:13] <%whyskeywolfe> It's just like my Japanese animes.
[2:42:16] <$RealThiele> power attack is +1 dmg for -2 hit iirc
[2:42:16] <%Promessa_EX> ground poound chrone2Amerage chrone2Amerage
[2:42:21] <%slimmixrp> It is
[2:42:21] <+Mindtrick_Matt> Can we get a bet going to see if Pat will lose?
[2:42:23] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Pat, if you walk into her, she'll back up, and you can push her out of the ring.
[2:42:23] <+HeroSolaire> Im pretty sure its better to just use normal attacks because yo u gut the accuracy with power attacks
[2:42:23] <+bugz_munny> its pretty fuckin hard
[2:42:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> You can also equip gear to boost your unarmed attacks (gloves and implants)
[2:42:28] <+Mindtrick_Matt> Cause it is Pat lol
[2:42:29] <notsoy> it's tough because you were stacking caster stats and this is physical only
[2:42:30] <tanarath> pfff
[2:42:31] <laserbeaming> you're a consular right? It'll be really tough for you without drugs
[2:42:33] <laserbeaming> do drugs
[2:42:34] <%slimmixrp> Its hard I think woolie cheesed it
[2:42:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> if you pause AND IMMEDIATELY OPEN MENU you can put on gear, i think
[2:42:35] <Gruhunchously> "Take the strongest Jedi Knight, strip away the Force, and what remains?"
[2:42:43] <subjectg> It’s really hard if you have no STR or DEx
[2:42:44] <+bugz_munny> It's this games version of that one Arena dude from taris
[2:42:44] <rawrmeowxd> Just kick her in the nuts
[2:42:45] <+zee_generate> isnt there a way to cheese this?
[2:42:47] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Just lower the difficult for this one part and then turn it back up after
[2:42:48] <+LegendairyRoast> wake up dp

[2:44:32] <$manwithboxonhead> Atris was also mad and spent the last 5 years trashing talking you every single day.
[2:44:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yes that's correct
[2:44:38] <$RealThiele> you turned on facial hygiene\ too

[2:46:48] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat's character is already covered in glue, in the truest Sith tradition
[2:46:56] <$manwithboxonhead> She is a companion if you are a male.
[2:46:57] <%juxtest> Does she look different?
[2:47:08] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> I want to Fuck the handmaiden.

[2:47:22] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur “I was originally slated to be in a spin-off to Jedi Knight, but I don’t wanna talk about what happened there.”
[2:47:32] <%FacetiousAF> was atris living through handmaiden?
[2:47:32] <rawrmeowxd> She aint no lusty argonian maid that's for sure
[2:47:41] <%RaziWraith> "Why wouldn't you trust me???" Maybe cuz of those sithy veins on your face, Karen. LUL

[3:08:18] <+lethallylactic> D:
[3:08:19] <%troxvon_the_lesser> The Jedi are the source of all this universe's problem because the sith only exist to hurt the jedi.
[3:08:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> what is Revan's Gender/Side?
[3:08:21] <+nirvana227> well isnt she nice
[3:08:23] <gnarly_memes_bro> atris is the jedi equivalent of hojo in the meeting room in ff7r
[3:08:28] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur pockets
[3:08:29] <%Dunmarkh> the exaggerated swagger of a white karen
[3:08:35] <%ScreamLord> "No it's the Dark Side tho" said Atris, repeatedly
[3:08:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Female full evil
[3:08:39] <%SirGO0SE> @KeiPrime her badoopers are fucking globes in this
[3:08:40] <Gruhunchously> @LiquidDinosaur Dark Side/Female
[3:08:44] <gnarly_memes_bro> even the rest of these goons don't like her
[3:08:51] <@commanderclaw> Vrook is the literal worst
[3:08:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FUCK YOU VROOK
[3:08:57] <%SomeSageAdvice> i swear every time it pans back to her, her eyes become more crossed
[3:09:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> Pockets is great
[3:09:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> VROOK IS MALE KAREN
[3:09:05] <CloniiCory> @gnarly_memes_bro She wants the Exile to breed with Gact?
[3:09:07] <Gruhunchously> Vrook the absolute worst
[3:09:07] <Teras_ode> Vrook the super boomer
[3:09:10] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> revan is a nonbinary grey jedi, the ultimate neutral
[3:09:16] <%MechArch> sad boop
[3:09:18] <%debugdrawray_> god atton looks like shit
[3:09:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> oh thank god, Ed Asner is still alive
[3:09:22] <%troxvon_the_lesser> @LiquidDinosaur I hardly remember but I was ligthside so she was actually pretty chill if I remember. Like she's like one step away from understanding the problem.
[3:09:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oh man I cant wait till we kill Vrook
[3:09:24] <%Mr_Pylon> every grand Jedi plan seems like "wait it out, it'll be better if we wait it out"
[3:09:26] <+Chewygamer> moon2N
[3:09:35] <gnarly_memes_bro> @cloniicory all story threads go backt to gackt eventually

[3:09:55] <OzzySnek> did that droid just fart a sentence?
[3:09:56] <%GarbageNirvana> Time for the shit list
[3:10:00] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Vrook is the fuck worst jedi ever
[3:10:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @liquiddinosaur WHY DID YOU SAY THAT?
[3:10:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> Honestly all the Jedi Masters feel relatively contrite EXCEPT VROOK
[3:10:15] <thepeacemain> Vrook fucking sucks yo
[3:10:19] <gnarly_memes_bro> @ozzysnek you are not alone, I also heard it as a fart
[3:10:21] <+nirvana227> what?

[3:10:28] <%jimjamstrawberryslamalam> Time to boop jedi masters?
[3:10:28] <VigilantShield> yes... convenient
[3:10:29] <CloniiCory> @gnarly_memes_bro He is eternal. I'll be shocked if Genesis doesn't show up in any new Compilation shit.
[3:10:30] <Gruhunchously> This is where Handmaiden would have showed up if you were male

[3:10:40] <+nirvana227> didnt he watch the holo? LUL
[3:10:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You triggered SO MANY THINGS back on Taris because of your alignment.
[3:10:51] <+Chewygamer> Handmaiden Kreygasm
[3:11:00] <intestinal_bleeding> gah I love Bao's voice
[3:11:03] <Gruhunchously> Also, Atris has been deep throating it for the past ten years so...
[3:11:06] <KeiPrime> bao dur is cool
[3:11:11] <laserbeaming> Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Zez-Kai Ell give you a lightsaber if you duel him without one?
[3:11:19] <thepeacemain> Bao Dur best boi
[3:11:21] <%jimjamstrawberryslamalam> Sad that we won't get punch maiden
[3:11:23] <KaitlynnHere> Karen is back in her closet slapping her vagina with it
[3:11:31] <subjectg> @gruhunchously that’d be pretty fucking dangerous when it’s double bladed
[3:11:33] <%MechArch> you need to go to radio shack
[3:11:34] <wibbwobbler> plus they're pretty rad
[3:11:42] <+nirvana227> kyber crystal PogChamp
[3:11:46] <rawrmeowxd> None of them would let me take their lightsaber apart even though I asked all the time
[3:12:01] <Gruhunchously> Atris literally fuming in the closet.
[3:12:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I can see Bao-Dur annoying the jedi with constant questions.

[3:14:27] <rawrmeowxd> That droid aint right. He keeps bending over when I have an almost empty cup

[3:15:49] <asylumkon> at least hk is super easy to get in the restored content mod
[3:15:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The Restored Content Mod makes HK repair real quick by restoring the HK50 encounters
[3:15:55] <laserbeaming> I believe you can get all the parts in Nar Shadaa?
[3:15:56] <rawrmeowxd> He needs a heart from the wizard! Help him dorothy!
[3:16:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> More evil HK fights/
[3:16:15] <+GuilKato> the HK50s spawn way more often
[3:16:18] <asylumkon> hk squads EVERYWHERE
[3:16:19] <+GuilKato> so you get more parts faster
[3:16:20] <%CatastropheCorvid> Every time you see an HK 50 IIRC
[3:16:20] <Gruhunchously> Let's talk to some people
[3:16:20] <%Monkeyweed21> HKs drop HK parts
[3:16:21] <laserbeaming> they added a bunch more of HK-50 fights that drop components
[3:16:26] <%YakumoYomi> More HK encounters, I think

[3:28:37] <%Maids4lyfe> grandma got her ass beat
[3:28:38] <+rainlily1245> implied rape yep
[3:28:43] <%juxtest> They told her she was fat
[3:28:44] <%Monkeyweed21> the best thing Chris Avellone ever wrote is Kreia
[3:28:54] <Aydarkzero> wait what monkaS
[3:28:54] <Sunstalker> He taught that granda how to suck eggs
[3:28:57] <rawrmeowxd> It was just a prank bro
[3:28:58] <Pyon84> pyon84Pog
[3:28:59] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat Whenever you level up a character and assign them their stats, they fully heal. If you want, you can save level ups as a self-heal when you're nearly dead.
[3:28:59] <subjectg> @thebensonator_ the implication is she got cut off
[3:29:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> Kreia... (sob)
[3:29:01] <$manwithboxonhead> Nihiuls is just standing there like “yea what”.
[3:29:08] <+MrParamedic> Why didn’t they kill her?
[3:29:09] <%Monkeyweed21> they put Kreia on a no flight list
[3:29:11] <+nirvana227> fulfill your destiny!
[3:29:14] <RandyBobandy72> is your character just Neo-Atris? lol

[3:29:15] <CursedNobleman> just get a tattoo that says DONT TRUST HER LIES
[3:29:31] <%Xevtes> @MrParamedic plot armor
[3:29:32] <Gruhunchously> Okay fine, jeez. I didn't expect it to get so heavy in here.
[3:29:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> @subjectg That's a great theory
[3:29:39] <%Daxalog> Its eating you right now
[3:29:41] <+megaman_sentinel> Karen has bad skin
[3:29:42] <+MrParamedic> Fair enough
[3:29:43] <%ssjklyco> He looks like he wants some meth
[3:29:44] <CursedNobleman> you look like shit gurl
[3:29:45] <VigilantShield> he says while looking like a corpse
[3:29:46] <%Maids4lyfe> look at his face
[3:29:49] <BlueLunecy> Atton you are already melting
[3:29:51] <Teras_ode> she looks pretty eaten already LUL
[3:29:51] <asylumkon> it's always felt weird that she tells you that she was super evil and you have to be ok with it
[3:29:52] <%Maids4lyfe> he's full of dark side too
[3:29:54] <BenLanBen> is that dude sick?

[3:30:15] <%WhereIsWill> so the darkside literally give you face veins??
[3:30:17] <%cafefunk> is everyone on your team evil
[3:30:17] <%king_wragles> @Maids4lyfe there aren't any mirrors on the ship actually
[3:30:28] <+Partialrecall2> if you think about it, maybe being evil is actually good, y'know
[3:30:30] <%wibbwobbler> kae'ryn might be the pos here
[3:30:31] <subjectg> @garbagequeenellie notice how she struggled to grab the lightsaber, and that whole “techniques there are no defense against” thing?
[3:30:32] <rawrmeowxd> Find a deathstick seller
[3:30:32] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[3:30:33] <Gruhunchously> OH, you didn't ask the handmaidens about his Echani stance, so you don't know :(
[3:30:34] <%Agami23> man i hope i never have to see pazaak ever again
[3:30:44] <%Xevtes> @Maids4lyfe yeah but he's a moron and doesn't know how to use a mirror
[3:30:45] <RetributionP> pat is trying his best to not make his team evil
[3:30:45] <%TheBensonator_> @subjectg i know that, that cutscene's just always entertaining to me over face punchies
[3:30:47] <%Daxalog> uh oh
[3:30:52] <%Promessa_EX> from my point of view the jedi are evil
[3:31:00] <KeiPrime> my wooshy woosh...

[3:31:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's not.
[3:31:28] <+Mindtrick_Matt> Its only a option if you talk to them before rescuing the team
[3:31:30] <%juxtest> Tell me about his "echani stance" is it big?
[3:31:33] <asylumkon> i think you have to ask where they are before you find their cells
[3:31:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's fine though.
[3:31:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> yeah she was also cut off from the force
[3:31:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.

[3:32:05] <CursedNobleman> @star_feline i aint playing that witcher nonsense LUL
[3:32:06] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat Should bring Bao-dur and pick selfish options to piss him off, very limited amount of talkies to lower his influence.
[3:32:07] <%AzureGale> Chat helps sometimes
[3:32:11] <%TinyLittleDancer> Haven't you played this game like 80 times tho?
[3:32:12] <rawrmeowxd> The chat is an enemy stand user
[3:32:16] <asylumkon> hivemind agrees hivemind is bad
[3:32:18] <%Futurecity10> local streamer gets fucked hardcore by their chat
[3:32:23] <subjectg> it’s pretty complicated getting all the shit in this game, like damn

[3:33:59] <%ssjklyco> This is just HK, the game
[3:34:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You're terminated fucker.
[3:34:08] <Gruhunchously> OPTIMAL ACCURACY RATIO ACHIEVED

[3:40:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> lol
[3:40:02] <TG_Cid11> Is that your dog in the background or the game? @PatStaresAt
[3:40:03] <KeiPrime> hahhaha
[3:40:05] <rawrmeowxd> Some assembly required
[3:40:11] <benjehuda> @benjehuda Oh boy, an onlyfans dedicated to starwars cantina music!
[3:40:12] <%Romuken> did he lose the video game?
[3:40:13] <tubit> oh nooo
[3:40:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> PRESS X
[3:40:24] <%catman042285> Ah Old school RPG's
[3:40:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah it kept happening.
[3:40:30] <%Romuken> for respects
[3:40:33] <%ssjklyco> You could have won all your battles
[3:40:34] <DatAsuna> You know if you had played the android version on your TV, the text would be bigger.
[3:40:42] <DatAsuna> And it would have mod/controller support
[3:40:54] <%WhereIsWill> time for an hour of inventory management! yeyeye
[3:41:03] <%ssjklyco> Why would he play a worst version?
[3:41:09] <%ssjklyco> with no mods
[3:41:27] <laserbeaming> The game has terrible memory leaks
[3:41:30] <Gruhunchously> What just happened?
[3:41:32] <%WhereIsWill> psaDab sipsipDab
[3:41:32] <Kain5707> pat whats your desktop background?
[3:41:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah
[3:41:38] <%MassConnect> dab?
[3:41:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The android ports of KOTOR 1 and 2 are actually solid.
[3:41:39] <%Blank9> pat cummed
[3:41:43] <Teras_ode> hopefully seeing that logo a bit more in a few years
[3:41:44] <gustavozxd> yeah
[3:41:44] <%SirGO0SE> gamer cramp
[3:41:45] <laserbeaming> the text skip bug is probably the worst
[3:41:48] <%FacetiousAF> "pee break"
[3:41:50] <%Monkeyweed21> pat just made a streamy
[3:41:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And they have mod support.
[3:41:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yes
[3:41:54] <+Partialrecall2> sam hyde?
[3:41:55] <%RetroCop87> I get that sometimes as a full-bdy twitch
[3:41:57] <ravioli_ronin> Oh I thought you were fucking dabbing
[3:42:00] <%SaiyanShoto> Good dab
[3:42:06] <%FacetiousAF> "pee break" from "drinking water"
[3:42:16] <%catman042285> nope
[3:42:16] <%MassConnect> the important "short person stretches for thing above them" stretch
[3:42:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> NO KEEP THE MINER UNIFORM
[3:42:16] <%twistedj3ster> sell Atton
[3:42:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> No armor for dog
[3:42:20] <VigilantShield> correct
[3:42:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Right
[3:42:21] <%SaiyanShoto> psaDab psaDab psaDab
[3:42:22] <asylumkon> right]
[3:42:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> KEP THE MINER UNIFORM THAT'S WHAT BAO DUR WEARS
[3:42:35] <%WhereIsWill> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:42:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> BUY IT BACK
[3:42:37] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat Bao-dur dialogue was severely cut from the game, so if you don't have him along until you make him a Jedi, chances are you probably won't ever make him one.
[3:42:43] <ravioli_ronin> They can only equip a big red robe
[3:42:49] <laserbeaming> Bao has the Echani Battlesuit I believe
[3:42:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> People put the miner outfit on Bao-Dur because it doesn't restrict force powers.
[3:42:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's fine Pat.
[3:42:55] <+Invaderjaymz> Hey chat, what's his class?
[3:43:03] <rawrmeowxd> LOL it's all good rpg player understand the hustle
[3:43:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And Bao-Dur can't wear robes.
[3:43:11] <+Partialrecall2> psaLiz
[3:43:16] <HotMafia81> Bowder
[3:43:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> Fuck that, just use force powers that arent restricted by armor
[3:43:23] <$Skittlesoul> time to bring back the favorite hashtag #14months
[3:43:27] <%Monkeyweed21> remember that Wookie kid watching porn holograms
[3:43:28] <DatAsuna> Until he has force powers that's irrelevant
[3:43:37] <+Partialrecall2> my favorite mario is bowder
[3:43:37] <%TinyLittleDancer> So long gay Bowder
[3:43:43] <asylumkon> i always just give him powers thay arent restricted by armor
[3:43:43] <%MassConnect> Bao derp
[3:43:45] <laserbeaming> yeah, he can't wear robes. I just give him force powers that are not restricted by armor
[3:43:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> lol
[3:43:57] <laserbeaming> because his AC is too low on light armor
[3:43:57] <%Monkeyweed21> why did you reload?
[3:44:07] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:44:08] <%Romuken> hug a doggo
[3:44:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> Here come the gobalins
[3:44:09] <%Daxalog> Theres no way your making it to 1
[3:44:10] <%TheBensonator_> PAT
[3:44:12] <Paciboyy> dont savescum and drive
[3:44:14] <+Chewygamer> moon2SMERG
[3:44:15] <%Dunmarkh> psaWhat
[3:44:18] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig psaWrong
[3:44:19] <$Skittlesoul> oh yeah this was a great time to come in
[3:44:19] <Teras_ode> need some coffee pat?
[3:44:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Bao-Dur is a guardian anyway.
[3:44:26] <%Monkeyweed21> stop save scumming
[3:44:30] <Noogiez> ass is all looped up
[3:44:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Why would you want him slinging force powers?
[3:44:49] <subjectg> Call your doctor if you’re save scumming for more than 5 hours
[3:44:56] <%SirGO0SE> but i thought Karen was anti-mask?
[3:44:56] <tanarath> @monkeyweed21 Pat always cheats
[3:45:00] <%twistedj3ster> cheat it in
[3:45:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> Sith Mask is OP but also lmao you have no face
[3:45:03] <rawrmeowxd> It need to be socially acceptable to wear those in public
[3:45:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah just have Bao be a punchmaster Tank and use Force Powers as an aftertought
[3:45:14] <+Chewygamer> use cheats moon2DOIT
[3:45:27] <Kain5707> but mines are good for opening locked stuff
[3:45:33] <subjectg> @patstaresat you don’t have the armor proficiency for the mask anyway
[3:45:57] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> karen does not wear a mask
[3:45:59] <Gruhunchously> Karen is broke?
[3:46:05] <tanarath> @kain5707 the kind of mine doesn't matter
[3:46:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> hell yes
[3:46:08] <laserbeaming> lol, Heavy Armor requirement for masks.
[3:46:08] <Paciboyy> arent you a dex build?
[3:46:10] <%Big_Dream> you can wear them
[3:46:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> +3 Str? YES
[3:46:13] <%Monkeyweed21> more like super Power Gauntlets
[3:46:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nah it is.
[3:46:31] <%CatastropheCorvid> You can crarft it
[3:46:32] <SnakeVash> SAVE
[3:46:33] <%Daxalog> Stun is incredible
[3:46:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's one of the best off-hand blasters.
[3:46:38] <%damienlunas> that's pretty good
[3:46:39] <%Monkeyweed21> no this guy sells good shit
[3:46:40] <%CatastropheCorvid> At 18 I think
[3:46:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'd just buy one really good stat boosting thing and then save up until planet 1 is finished
[3:46:42] <asylumkon> making a DC 14 save is pretty easy
[3:46:42] <laserbeaming> Stun is meh, extra damage on crit. Average damage
[3:46:45] <laserbeaming> you can
[3:46:47] <%Daxalog> You get pats that just add stun
[3:46:47] <XX_Apexfury_XX> this music always fucked with me
[3:46:49] <Kain5707> @tanarath oh i didnt know that
[3:46:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah, switch to Bao-Dur.
[3:46:50] <subjectg> You can craft a better version of that @patstaresat
[3:46:54] <%Daxalog> parts
[3:46:55] <%Visorak6> DC 14 isnt particularly hard later on
[3:47:04] <abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah totally Pat
[3:47:13] <%SolidusRex> yes
[3:47:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Bao-Dur will be able to craft more items because he's the skill monkey.
[3:47:39] <GarbageQueenEllie> Remember: T3, Bao Dur and GotO have better skills than you, so make them craft upgrades
[3:47:45] <Paciboyy> bao dur is such a fucking cool character holy shit
[3:48:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "Hell yeah me too"
[3:48:09] <%damienlunas> You enjoyed all the killing, that's why.
[3:48:28] <%CatastropheCorvid> HOES MAD
[3:48:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> HOES MAD
[3:48:33] <%Daxalog> That beat has an instant pavlov response
[3:48:37] <Teras_ode> HOES MAD
[3:48:38] <Gruhunchously> HOES MAD
[3:48:46] <%damienlunas> HOES MAD
[3:48:48] <%Romuken> HOES MAD
[3:48:48] <chll0ne> HOES MAD
[3:48:51] <%TheBensonator_> [Hoes Mad x24]
[3:49:02] <%SolidusRex> HOES MAD
[3:49:03] <Gravega> I tried play thing game many times over the years but never got to finish it, why is KOTOR 2 so shit compared to KOTOR? LuvUok
[3:49:11] <Teras_ode> love ya chat LUL
[3:49:14] <abelincoln_catpuncher> BRUH WHAT
[3:49:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> Higher Repair Skill = less component cost
[3:49:26] <+OmegaWeltall> Yo granny WTF?! HOES MAD! [x24}
[3:49:27] <abelincoln_catpuncher> you can make some BUSTED ass shit @patstaresat
[3:49:29] <Gruhunchously> @Gravega Because they only had 14 months to develop it.
[3:49:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Gravega it was rushed to release for christmas so it was unfinished. Play it again with the Restored Contnent Mod
[3:49:37] <laserbeaming> It's not that good
[3:49:43] <%Monkeyweed21> then why level Repair?
[3:49:44] <subjectg> @patstaresat dude the best lightsaber parts need to be crafted
[3:50:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> Woolie got the best armor in the entire game from this guy
[3:50:19] <%Visorak6> power gauntlets, more like superpower gauntlets
[3:50:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Turn T3 into your own personal crafting foundry
[3:50:21] <ishouldbeatworklol> @patstaresat when you gonna play fall guys season 3?
[3:50:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> the Jal Shey Mentor armor
[3:50:25] <Gravega> @LiquidDinosaur How did they restore content if it was never finished? cmonBruh
[3:50:45] <%Monkeyweed21> why isn't Kreia dual weilding?
[3:50:47] <Gruhunchously> Woolie managed to purchase end-game armor from this shop. At the beginning of the game.
[3:50:59] <Gruhunchously> @Monkeyweed21 Er...
[3:50:59] <CursedNobleman> @Monkeyweed21 shes missing a hand
[3:51:01] <Teras_ode> there's a lot of jank in the game, but it has a pretty good story and also has by far the best dark side character in it
[3:51:24] <%Monkeyweed21> That shouldn't stop her @CursedNobleman
[3:51:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Gravega A lot of it was almost finished. There's still some weird bits but its much better, especially around the end. This playthrough has that mod installed.
[3:51:37] <+KaseTriedAgain> Hey @PatStaresAt Just raided you, hope you are good and well. gonna go to sleep as it is 4am and listen to CSB like I do every night! Thanks for helping a lot during Covid <3
[3:51:39] <gustavozxd> if only I liked playing this game at all atpFeelsBeardMan
[3:51:44] <Gruhunchously> It's true.
[3:51:46] <%WhereIsWill> i believe it
[3:51:48] <DatAsuna> the choice stuff yes, the party members chipping in not so much
[3:51:48] <CursedNobleman> @Monkeyweed21 youre not wrong, but modeling and engine effort
[3:51:49] <tanarath> @gravega Play it withe the restored content mod that restores only the needed stuff, because of of the restored content sucks.
[3:51:58] <%WhereIsWill> ive actually never played any kotors
[3:51:58] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> too bad I hate video games
[3:52:00] <Badgerconda_> i replayed this game so many times back in the day.
[3:52:07] <VigilantShield> you know EA will say it wont make enough money because not enough micro transactions
[3:52:12] <subjectg> Kotor 2 is also relatively short in comparison to other rpgs so it’s not too much of a slog
[3:52:14] <DatAsuna> take it from me, I had to make a video of literally every variable for woolie lol
[3:52:18] <%WhereIsWill> but i've watched all of yalls content of it lol
[3:52:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt The game is trying to spawn Visas but she's not allowed to show up on Telos
[3:52:25] <%Romuken> #ClownGoth
[3:52:34] <%SirGO0SE> he totally did
[3:52:38] <CursedNobleman> @WhereIsWill it suffers from gameplay excitement, the story is interesting, but as with all these damned rpgs the gameplay is mmoey
[3:52:42] <+Partialrecall2> if you like missable content you must love ME3. "why is this enemy named jack??!!" "oh kelly is dead i guess" "why is this banshee named? god damn it"
[3:52:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This always happens if you trigger her before reaching a second planet.
[3:52:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> @VigilantShield We need to execute all microtransactions like a plague.
[3:52:45] <%TIME_PUNCHER> is that a mandalorian
[3:52:56] <gustavozxd> I feel like the way of the samurai 3 combat would be cool for star wars, a good game needs to have that ombat
[3:53:04] <%SomeSageAdvice> did i heard a laughing Paige?
[3:53:11] <%SomeSageAdvice> or am i crazy
[3:53:14] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> @VigilantShield they've actually been backing off on micros for star wars shit. BF2 's new system is completely inoffensive and fallen order has non whatsoever. not sure about squadrons
[3:53:31] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> @gustavozxd WOTS is my fav jank ass game. That'd be badass
[3:53:34] <Gruhunchously> Are we goin to Dan Two Ine
[3:53:43] <laserbeaming> not Nar Shadaa?
[3:53:57] <CursedNobleman> but mira?
[3:53:57] <%TIME_PUNCHER> fun fact, in star wars datooine means datooine
[3:54:01] <DatAsuna> Good choice
[3:54:01] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Also EA isn't the only publisher making Star Wars game now
[3:54:04] <jellssssss20> Don Toreen?
[3:54:07] <laserbeaming> oh right, Disciple
[3:54:09] <Aydarkzero> Sith Lady
[3:54:17] <+Partialrecall2> @DickieWoodsmall_279 if you look at most bought things on steam under 5 bucks it micro currency for old republic LMAO
[3:54:22] <%Fooguwu> pat does not love HK
[3:54:26] <%Monkeyweed21> but HK
[3:54:26] <CursedNobleman> fair point
[3:54:30] <Aydarkzero> there's different routes?
[3:54:32] <+vaderxyz1970> You also get a swing at Vrook
[3:54:36] <%Maids4lyfe> Immediately
[3:54:41] <DatAsuna> If you bring handmaiden to recruit disciple she has a fun jab at him
[3:54:43] <Badgerconda_> pretty sure you can get a lightsaber and visas on nar shadaa too
[3:54:44] <asylumkon> pretty liberal use of the word immediately
[3:54:49] <%TIME_PUNCHER> does HK have a lightsabre? i didn't think so
[3:54:49] <gustavozxd> @gustavozxd yeah, unfortunately for me doing anything other than the combat in that game (3 specifically) drives me crazy so I kinda never want to play it
[3:54:50] <Gruhunchously> You can get HK realtively quickly on Dantooine.
[3:54:50] <%cvp5127> tittos
[3:54:52] <%SirGO0SE> booba pls
[3:54:52] <%Monkeyweed21> so does HK
[3:54:54] <Badgerconda_> visas is the big tiddy goth gf of spaaaaaace
[3:54:55] <%snow_bush> Hey everyone Visauce here
[3:54:58] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> big tiddie goth gf for the win
[3:54:59] <@commanderclaw> Pat is a boob man as exhibited by his choices
[3:55:00] <CursedNobleman> NotLikeThis
[3:55:00] <DatAsuna> And you get Hk parts on dantooine too anyway
[3:55:00] <ravioli_ronin> Pat doesn’t like being called a meat bag
[3:55:02] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> @Partialrecall2 but that game is ancient and also an MMO, a genre designed to take in recurrent spending since its inception
[3:55:04] <%MidnightBurst12> shoot them?
[3:55:05] <%AncelDeLambert> "She shoot the milkies"
[3:55:06] <%Agami23> shoot the milkies like a GUN
[3:55:06] <Paciboyy> good choice
[3:55:07] <%Blank9> hk is forever, visas titties are only there for so long before they sag
[3:55:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It kind of sucks that RCM doesn't include a Handmaiden and Disciple patch by default.
[3:55:09] <DianaTheAscian> I hate that meme so much
[3:55:11] <Kain5707> booba
[3:55:12] <%Maids4lyfe> the force is stored in the milkies?
[3:55:18] <Aydarkzero> neat
[3:55:20] <%Monkeyweed21> we are
[3:55:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Because there's a surprising amount of stuff for having both of them.
[3:55:21] <%MechArch> nah i think pat is an ass man
[3:55:23] <CursedNobleman> HE LEFT HK IN... ONE. PIECE. YEAH
[3:55:27] <%TIME_PUNCHER> force milk
[3:55:28] <%ssjklyco> Get that blue milk
[3:55:33] <El_GhostV1> Meat bags over being called meat bag
[3:55:34] <Gruhunchously> Bad idea
[3:55:35] <%AncelDeLambert> Bang bang I'm the Milk Sheriff
[3:55:35] <laserbeaming> oh no
[3:55:36] <ravioli_ronin> The whole Star Wars title crawl is stored in the milkies
[3:55:37] <+Dova573> The one piece was Hk all along?!
[3:55:42] <%Huntercd> ironmouseWTF ironmouseWTF
[3:55:42] <%SirGO0SE> me? :)
[3:55:42] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> thru the dark side, tits will never sag. such is the power the Jedi don't want to tell you
[3:55:43] <chll0ne> YO HOHOHO
[3:55:43] <+Gespens> HK for everything
[3:55:44] <%MidnightBurst12> that's a mistake
[3:55:44] <Aydarkzero> the cool ones :)
[3:55:45] <DatAsuna> G0t0 for the enclave ruins
[3:55:48] <%AncelDeLambert> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[3:55:49] <DatAsuna> so you already missed that
[3:55:51] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat There's a merchant in Nar Shadaa (who's technically light-side-path) that sells random good items if you resolve Dantooine (save settlers) and Onderon (either side) problems.
[3:55:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> What did you call me?
[3:56:02] <Paciboyy> shes telling you to talk to the manager
[3:56:05] <CursedNobleman> goddamn this game and its ambient sound effects
[3:56:08] <%Maids4lyfe> Dantooine sucks
[3:56:08] <gustavozxd> nice
[3:56:09] <%TinyLittleDancer> Just a heads up, I've never played this game but I will hold very strong opinions on these matters
[3:56:09] <Badgerconda_> that fuckin' flying manta ray thing, man.
[3:56:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You will always be missing something.
[3:56:14] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaMenace
[3:56:16] <Gruhunchously> HE SURE DOES
[3:56:16] <%catman042285> I haven't played this in like 15 years
[3:56:17] <%TheDeceasedJester> Hk in the background: Oh come on meatbag, really! Kiss my shiny metal ass!
[3:56:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[3:56:19] <DatAsuna> G0t0 threatens to sell a guy into slavery yeah
[3:56:22] <asylumkon> i think most of use are familiar with how to get influence, not lose it
[3:56:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> Mehhh I say keep going
[3:56:35] <DatAsuna> it's not a big deal
[3:56:39] <subjectg> @patstaresat if you’re told to rescue a guy named Jorran, you can wait and bring goto for that
[3:56:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Every single area has stuff that requires you to have gone somewhere else first.

[4:04:41] <%WhereIsWill> LUL
[4:04:47] <ravioli_ronin> “Where can I find the milkies?”
[4:04:52] <%XeroSigmaPrime> 76 is much better now... still shit tho
[4:04:58] <bob900000> what about Fallout 77
[4:05:21] <+RiddleMeWhat> not really
[4:05:22] <Paciboyy> probably
[4:05:22] <Grunkle_Dan_> yes
[4:05:23] <@commanderclaw> No but you can mitigate it
[4:05:25] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> god why are video games so shit
[4:05:25] <%CatastropheCorvid> Yes. One sec.
[4:05:25] <El_GhostV1> Is it?
[4:05:25] <%dekkitout> Maybe, lemme go search enxus
[4:05:25] <+RiddleMeWhat> I do like FROST though
[4:05:26] <Kain5707> fallout 4 LUL
[4:05:26] <%Bonkasaurusrex> Not really.
[4:05:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Not really.
[4:05:28] <+RiddleMeWhat> it's brutal
[4:05:30] <%TIME_PUNCHER> eeeeeh
[4:05:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Yup
[4:05:31] <%catman042285> probably?
[4:05:31] <%Visorak6> Dont think so?
[4:05:36] <Grunkle_Dan_> modders restored the old system
[4:05:36] <Sunstalker> Really? even though the quests suck so much?
[4:05:39] <%CatastropheCorvid> PRKF and "You Are Special".
[4:05:39] <%FacetiousAF> define "garbage" for not completely garbage
[4:05:41] <%Dunmarkh> unlikely
[4:05:42] <tanarath> @patstaresat Outer Worlds/Wasteland 3
[4:05:42] <%FacetiousAF> fuck
[4:05:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There are mods that attempt to fix it but none of them really succeed as much as you want.
[4:05:46] <+djinnJuice> It's a half-step. A little better but still not amazing
[4:05:47] <RetributionP> that uniform only matters if he is a jedi
[4:05:52] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> yeah it's called install fallout 3
[4:05:52] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> is there PerMa for fallout 4?
[4:05:52] <bob900000> yes
[4:05:54] <Manipulator98> I've benn playing vanillarecently and it sucks
[4:05:56] <DatAsuna> ew
[4:05:57] <%FacetiousAF> ffffuckin
[4:06:01] <+RiddleMeWhat> Charisma is an outright useless stat in 4
[4:06:04] <%FacetiousAF> define "garbage" for not completely garbage..
[4:06:06] <+RiddleMeWhat> nothing can fix that
[4:06:09] <%TIME_PUNCHER> technically if you cheat and max all the skills, it fixes every worrying about the skill system?
[4:06:11] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Theres a ton of mods that do just that
[4:06:13] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt does Zangief's breed get dandruff problems?
[4:06:17] <+TomDanksEGOT> its called Fallout New Vegas
[4:06:18] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt PRKF and "You Are Special". The first one expands the system, and "You Are Special brings it closer to New Vegas skill system.
[4:06:20] <%rekinom> Haven't seen the wet wipes in a while
[4:06:25] <%ZephynM> ZephynM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Hello my fellow Ginger Beard, man. Thank you for being awesome and giving me something to chill to after work! Praise be Elmo. psaElmo sipsipHellmo
[4:06:30] <+RiddleMeWhat> not if I don't tolerate villagers in my presence
[4:06:31] <%dekkitout> I found "Be Exceptional" for Fo4 that makes the ui similar to older games
[4:06:31] <%Romuken> I got it for free, enjoying it up until now when I got a workshop with a random, then they unjoined the team and murdered me, took all my junk and some caps, and began capturing the base. Problem is that the game refused to let me out of the zone, like...not respawn at my camp? So I had to respawn there and try to take him out. Ended up losing 500 caps and the junk... TBH I could have just changed servers, but I was a very persistent bitch.
[4:06:31] <Grunkle_Dan_> @PatStaresAt search "Be Exceptional" on nexus mods
[4:06:38] <bob900000> just play new vegas

[4:06:58] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt I'll see if I kept my modlist.
[4:07:02] <Sunstalker> You would think that, but you'd be wrong
[4:07:02] <Badgerconda_> fallout 4 is kinda neat, it's just that the story is so fucking stupid.
[4:07:04] <%Agami23> hey pat, i saw a really, REALLY good threat today.
[4:07:06] <%Monkeyweed21> Far Harbor is legit
[4:07:09] <+RiddleMeWhat> my dog got pretty flaky on his lower back at the base of the tail
[4:07:13] <+RiddleMeWhat> seems to be a spot to watch
[4:07:13] <Paciboyy> 4 is a fun enough skyrim ripoff
[4:07:16] <Badgerconda_> and the world isn't interesting enough to ignore the story and just explore.
[4:07:20] <benjehuda> <3

[4:14:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> CHARISMA is a real world super power.
[4:14:18] <%Romuken> You do realize I'm a fucking jedi, right? You do realize ACCESS DENIED
[4:14:23] <%Agami23> @Too_Much_Nukie ohhhh
[4:14:25] <%Daxalog> wow
[4:14:29] <gustavozxd> force charisma
[4:14:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> So Meetra Surik is a natural leader, but not especially talented as a jedi.
[4:14:46] <+RiddleMeWhat> Revan got you 90% of the way naturally, then if the 10% was necessary then we take out the force push
[4:14:48] <AnacondaVirtue> They are talking about Revan, you goober.
[4:14:55] <%Agami23> the point stands, is this like force charisma?
[4:14:58] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> is influence a passive force ability?
[4:15:01] <Djinnazz> Yeah there is

[4:26:20] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> what about snoke tubes?
[4:26:24] <Gruhunchously> Guy kills planets with his mere presence.
[4:26:26] <%dekkitout> @GarbageQueenEllie Atton would be fine with being a cuck

[4:26:34] <%RetroCop87> So he's Moro
[4:26:35] <HotMafia81> Entropy Man
[4:26:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Nihilus is a black hole that hungers
[4:26:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's called a problem.
[4:26:43] <thetruenicster> You mean to tell me Nihilus is Galactus?
[4:26:49] <%beefomkers> That guy sounds awesome. How do I be that guy?
[4:26:51] <+RiddleMeWhat> he's Star Wars Noface
[4:26:51] <ravioli_ronin> It’s a shame everyone brought on to write the prequels can’t imagine anything worse than a planet blowing up
[4:26:58] <%dekkitout> He's *name a planet eater from fiction*
[4:27:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> @dekkitout "Pazaak yea I'm proud to be a cuck!"
[4:27:03] <+corrosivePaladin> oh. thats some badass haunted armor then if he can just suck off a whole planet
[4:27:31] <%MechArch> what if they brought nihilus to the movies but he was a big evil cloud?
[4:27:43] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @patstaresat nihilus is just sith galactus?
[4:27:44] <+RiddleMeWhat> Old Republic is literally the most mine-able IP asteroid in the franchise belt and Disney is too ignorant to know it exists, let alone reach out to tap into it
[4:27:51] <Djinnazz> well...
[4:27:52] <Gruhunchously> @corrosivePaladin He might not even have a corporeal form at this point. he might just be a force spirit inhabiting that armor.
[4:27:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Wait...
[4:27:56] <Hellarussian> process of elimination
[4:27:57] <ravioli_ronin> “All life must die, cause I’m hungy”

[4:28:06] <%Romuken> *reluctant upvote*
[4:28:06] <%dekkitout> Like the flipside of the Phoenix Force
[4:28:07] <+RiddleMeWhat> SWORD LOGIC
[4:28:08] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> what if you were so pissed off all the time you couldn't die
[4:28:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> Then what is the natural awful conclusion to the Light Side?
[4:28:27] <%beefomkers> Yeah those guys rule
[4:28:29] <+RiddleMeWhat> I will cut the universe into its heat death early. Why? Because I can.
[4:28:30] <Gruhunchously> He doesn't even think that far ahead. His logic is basically 'I'm hungry, feed me".
[4:28:34] <%StebTheVee> Man too angry too de
[4:28:34] <%Visorak6> What if you just hold your body together
[4:28:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @GarbageQueenEllie Atris
[4:28:38] <%beefomkers> @garbagequeenellie Suicide
[4:28:38] <+corrosivePaladin> that literally is just sword logic
[4:28:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> BE A SIMP
[4:28:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And Vrook
[4:28:40] <CrypticMochi> Relinquish your humanity and become a force Galactus
[4:28:50] <RaidenRising> too angry to die
[4:28:54] <%wibbwobbler> powa
[4:28:57] <ravioli_ronin> Wait is Nihilus just Darth Vore
[4:28:57] <tanarath> But Pat, Snoke, though
[4:28:58] <Gorgs7> @GarbageQueenEllie everyone will be nice to each other if there's no one to be evil to each other
[4:28:59] <+corrosivePaladin> i cant believe stsrwars ripped off destiny
[4:29:04] <%Puhff> I will also die if I stop raging
[4:29:15] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie Atris
[4:29:20] <+RiddleMeWhat> Sword Logic is tied with Vex Simulation as the Coolest Thing Destiny Doesn't Utilize
[4:29:20] <heartlesshealer> I can't believe starwars ripped off Kingdom Hearts Lingering Will
[4:29:29] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> but Sion literally simps himself to death
[4:29:33] <%dekkitout> @GarbageQueenEllie Probably the phoenix force from marvel. A multiversal encompassing entity that is an aggregate of life fore that has fickle fits of passion
[4:29:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kae'Ryn's strength is her existence as a human thunderstorm :)
[4:29:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oooh maybe suck out the humanity of everyone in the universe so that they don't have any individuality. Galactic Lobotomy
[4:29:42] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> that's jedi shit

[4:29:54] <+MillerLowlife> nihlus is the extreme of number go up player
[4:29:59] <+RiddleMeWhat> Scion is just a simp name unfortunately, think of Worm
[4:30:04] <+RiddleMeWhat> simped to death
[4:30:13] <Djinnazz> It's like having nothing to eat but this fruit, the bigger bite you take the more ppl die. But you gotta eat.
[4:30:20] <+Gespens> Mmmm vore
[4:30:23] <%beefomkers> Nihlus is fucking rad
[4:30:24] <HotMafia81> Sucked them into his hole

[4:31:07] <CrypticMochi> We were left with the shit Jedi
[4:31:09] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> Big Force Hungry is my favorite dark side power
[4:31:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Scion means descendant basically. Sion is the child of the sith teachings.
[4:31:18] <ravioli_ronin> You have to inflate Darth Vore to defeat him
[4:31:21] <+RiddleMeWhat> Cookie Cat is discontinued in this timeline
[4:31:21] <HotMafia81> His favorite gum has yet to come back in style.
[4:31:22] <Gruhunchously> He snacks
[4:31:25] <%beefomkers> Force eat
[4:31:35] <heartlesshealer> psaGiefrail
[4:31:41] <nobleclonetrooper> this never made sense to me. The Force isn't just like a power source that can be removed. They said it bound the galaxy together. Shouldn't removing the force actually remove reality from that spot?
[4:31:42] <%wibbwobbler> that is rad, too many jedi attract him
[4:32:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> @nobleclonetrooper Or snuff out all life...
[4:32:08] <+RiddleMeWhat> there's a webnovel where a character named Scion dies a similarly simpy death, in that they're a Superman standin who gets bullied until he lets the heroes win
[4:32:13] <+mikesapartment> yeah she does not

[4:32:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> SOCKETS
[4:32:29] <%beefomkers> @nobleclonetrooper No science is also real in star wars but the force also exists. The force is a religion
[4:32:31] <%dekkitout> @nobleclonetrooper Good question, I can't remember if the game even implies that as a consequence
[4:32:33] <heartlesshealer> all forehead yes
[4:32:33] <Gruhunchously> @nobleclonetrooper I mean basically. Places dead to the force are just this unnatural emptiness.
[4:32:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> Don't need eyes to be hot. Just that sexy voice
[4:32:41] <heartlesshealer> but sockets

[4:34:12] <%beefomkers> you were nice
[4:34:16] <nobleclonetrooper> idk, the statement that "The planet still spins" makes it seem like all Nihilus does is kill life which seems too small scale for what removing the Force would actually do.
[4:34:20] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> NET ZERO INTERACTION
[4:34:22] <Gruhunchously> You simped yourself back to the light side.

[4:48:03] <RaidenRising> oh no is visax
[4:48:05] <%dekkitout> I hope Donald hits Nihilus with a phat Zeta Flare
[4:48:20] <%Agami23> man, i still cant believe donald fucking canonically DIES in kingdom hearts
[4:48:33] <+RiddleMeWhat> that wall isn't enough to keep nihilus out, donald
[4:48:39] <%Huntercd> 'lightsaber' luxxP luxxGasm
[4:48:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> Man I fucking wish Donald and Goofy died in the first game. Fuck those guys.
[4:48:58] <%juxtest> I was only betraying myself and everyone around me so I could gain POWER. You understand, right Kreia?
[4:48:59] <Djinnazz> bitch you know why.
[4:49:17] <HotMafia81> How do you think Kreia glues that turtle neck to her jawline?
[4:49:23] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt Ask her about Nihilus.
[4:49:29] <+Dova573> You think Kreia would hate vergil?
[4:49:36] <%dekkitout> Haven't Donald and Goofy both died by 3?
[4:49:45] <+RiddleMeWhat> Goofy is already half-Xehanort, it's too late
[4:49:47] <%Maids4lyfe> they came back
[4:49:59] <Gruhunchously> :)
[4:50:09] <%dekkitout> No no, I mean haven't they both died at least once
[4:50:14] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> every character dies in 3, it's actually funny as shit
[4:50:28] <Hellarussian> no pp?
[4:50:30] <+RiddleMeWhat> it's a space turtleneck, she uses the force
[4:50:31] <+cherryceecee> @PatStaresAt does kotor use a mod manager or is it all manual?
[4:50:39] <GarbageQueenEllie> @DickieWoodsmall_279 And Sora cries and shits his pants, it's amazing
[4:50:56] <%Maids4lyfe> it's all true
[4:50:58] <+RiddleMeWhat> I gotta hit the hay, good stream and goodnight
[4:51:10] <+Dova573> lol
[4:51:12] <%wibbwobbler> gawrsh
[4:51:21] <Gruhunchously> Wait what?
[4:51:22] <@SoFarFetched> geefDarth geefDarth
[4:51:23] <tanarath> @cherryceecee I think they have a mod manager
[4:51:25] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> when kairi got stabbed for real I almost fell out of my chair
[4:51:35] <%ZephynM> So cold you'd think she is a portable freezer.
[4:51:36] <Gruhunchously> I never ever heard that dialogue before, that's hilarious.
[4:51:36] <ChungusQuest> you let her be cool and mysterious, and she liked that
[4:51:39] <%Visorak6> That was quiet?
[4:51:41] <%Dunmarkh> LUL
[4:51:42] <RetributionP> smol dark
[4:51:47] <@SoFarFetched> are we having fun,Pat? geefPlz
[4:51:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Pat, Kreia LIKES you using people. Say that you love them or some shit
[4:51:55] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt just use cheat engine
[4:51:56] <tanarath> Dark side later
[4:51:58] <astrophizz> she's down bad
[4:52:30] <%AtomicHeartSon> this is just how Pat plays RPGs
[4:52:43] <RetributionP> who do we need 0 influence anyway
[4:52:44] <Gruhunchously> The mind goblins won't let him be.
[4:52:53] <Hellarussian> I relate to the goblins
[4:52:59] <RetributionP> why
[4:53:03] <Gruhunchously> Because goblins.
[4:53:09] <Admiral_PopnFresh> power gaming KOTOR2, wow
[4:53:25] <%dekkitout> Nonplussed Kreia is prime Kreia
[4:53:28] <HotMafia81> Yes hate me, mommy Kreia
[4:53:31] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> minmaxing relationships in a sw game
[4:53:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Pat, loving bitchy women
[4:53:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> Kreia is a puppeteer- if you manipulate people, use them as tools, she loves it.
[4:53:49] <%juxtest> You know you're evil when you have an all consuming need to even piss off the neutral character
[4:53:53] <%TheLemuroid> That's so awesome
[4:54:08] <Cyphereous> "Well first off, through The Force, all things are possible."
[4:54:25] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> fuck whenever I see kotor it makes me want to play a sw rpg and I always end up reinstalling battlefront 2 instead
[4:54:35] <Gruhunchously> A compelling point.
[4:54:57] <%dekkitout> So the force is like spiral energy?
[4:55:01] <RetributionP> play the mmo it's neat
[4:55:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> A violent to nowhere. A road i like to call, Violence Road
[4:55:20] <tanarath> Pat, Kreia likes it if you're independent.
[4:55:23] <HotMafia81> Nihilus with the slow S U C C
[4:55:26] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> i don't have a pc, i'm poor and destitute
[4:55:30] <%dekkitout> Woops, the force has a memory leak
[4:55:35] <+s0lesurviv0r> force vamps?
[4:55:41] <Hellarussian> he wants all the force juice
[4:55:52] <Gruhunchously> He's just a hungry boy.
[4:56:03] <+rdark_ksu> bro is just hungry
[4:56:21] <+Dova573> Hes no man, HES THE DEVIL
[4:56:24] <+Dova573> Kappa
[4:56:29] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> he snacc
[4:56:31] <takokasa> just a miserable pile of secrets
[4:56:37] <%Blank9> dark later
[4:56:38] <RetributionP> mod it now
[4:56:41] <+Dova573> His force and hunger is MAXIMUM
[4:56:47] <%dekkitout> Kick a few vagrants
[4:56:48] <Tina_Skellybutt> That light side will buff out
[4:56:49] <RetributionP> make him look like broly
[4:56:52] <+thetormundy> not the youglings
[4:56:53] <%AzureGale> Strike down the younglings
[4:56:54] <%cafefunk> thank god, we were becoming too lawful
[4:57:02] <%juxtest> The Dark Side made his dick fall off, trust me I'd know.
[4:57:20] <%Dunmarkh> YES
[4:57:23] <%Monkeyweed21> you did
[4:57:26] <Gruhunchously> Yeah. You broke it.
[4:57:35] <%catman042285> ah entropy
[4:58:26] <RetributionP> shit I wana play kotor 2 again but I'm still in the middle of playing pillars 2 for the first time
[4:58:40] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> holy shit chat we can see her feat
[4:59:08] <Gruhunchously> Sentinel
[4:59:12] <@commanderclaw> Visas is a Sentinel
[4:59:15] <laserbeaming> she's a Sentinel
[4:59:17] <bigcatryan> what does TSLRCM mean
[4:59:19] <%WhereIsWill> my life, for visas
[4:59:25] <%Monkeyweed21> more like Sextinel
[4:59:28] <bigcatryan> also hor-ror nice whose line reference
[4:59:34] <asylumkon> sentinal
[4:59:34] <RetributionP> did pat beat pillars 2 off screen or did he drop it after that stream awhile back
[4:59:35] <+siphoned_soul> PogChamp
[4:59:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod
[4:59:44] <%dekkitout> The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod, I think
[4:59:53] <bigcatryan> neat thank you
[4:59:56] <laserbeaming> we Tier 3 sub Visas in this
[5:00:03] <Gruhunchously> Which weirdly made her the most adept at Security and Computer Use in my party. Not what i would expect from her but...she's full of surprises.
[5:00:12] <laserbeaming> Master Speed is busted
[5:00:16] <%Monkeyweed21> it is a good
[5:00:17] <%catman042285> i agee
[5:00:19] <Gruhunchously> Speed is always useful
[5:00:25] <+TheBigO75> I agree burst of speed is good
[5:00:35] <+Noxyba> There is literally no reason not to have speed activated all the time
[5:00:38] <Gruhunchously> Master Speed breaks the game over it's back.
[5:00:41] <%WhereIsWill> dex god visas
[5:00:43] <%Monkeyweed21> speed is best when you leave the effects on
[5:00:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> Finesse would be great
[5:00:47] <%AncelDeLambert> y'know what's good? Force Jump. that's why I always cheat it in
[5:00:47] <rjhascancer> could be bigger
[5:00:59] <%AzureGale> Such a hard and firm DEX
[5:00:59] <RetributionP> big dex huh
[5:01:06] <laserbeaming> you probably want her at 16 charisma
[5:01:07] <%catman042285> Give her the D?
[5:01:14] <rjhascancer> yeeeeee
[5:01:20] <%dekkitout> Get a dex pump
[5:01:30] <HotMafia81> Yeah pump her dex like crazy
[5:01:35] <laserbeaming> +1 to DCs, more force points
[5:01:38] <rjhascancer> do it -sidious voice
[5:02:01] <RetributionP> pat saids dex weird
[5:02:08] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> dex is stored in the titties
[5:02:09] <asylumkon> i think she has the same stat array as bastila
[5:03:05] <@SoFarFetched> pick your nose
[5:03:09] <%catman042285> heal?
[5:03:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> Heal might be good. She has the CHA for it
[5:03:37] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> pick your nose and your butthole, order doesn't matter
[5:03:48] <El_GhostV1> Force scream?
[5:03:56] <%snugglepuggs> With Finesse
[5:03:58] <Noogiez> pick the one where you win the game sir
[5:04:34] <laserbeaming> Energy Resistance is really good
[5:04:38] <DatAsuna> Is it gay to give your girlfriend energy resistance?
[5:04:41] <%catman042285> speed mk 2?
[5:04:44] <laserbeaming> I think it stacks with Shield
[5:05:09] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> have you ever wiped too hard and pushed your finger through the tp into your butthole and accidentally cum
[5:05:16] <subjectg> All force buffs should stack
[5:05:23] <%dekkitout> Naturally, Pat chooses zapping
[5:05:39] <+projectmanatees> Is kotor 1 worth playing through as the start is a bit of a slog
[5:05:42] <%WhereIsWill> now where dem orphans at!?
[5:06:00] <%Ranryu692> just make one!
[5:06:09] <laserbeaming> it's weird, because this is supposed to be based on D&D 3e. But things that never stack in 3e absolutely stack in this game
[5:06:12] <Gruhunchously> Zapping system
[5:06:14] <%MechArch> need to go to the pit
[5:06:19] <%Futurecity10> KILL IY
[5:06:21] <DatAsuna> theme of pazaak
[5:06:23] <laserbeaming> Deflection Bonus? Never heard of that
[5:06:39] <%Futurecity10> Murder him before woolie comes in and plays pazaak for 2 hours
[5:06:45] <Gruhunchously> Sorry Granny, I'm giving your job to my new gf.
[5:06:58] <DatAsuna> it's time to d-d-d-d-duel
[5:06:59] <AdmiralButtloaf> Bao Dur clipping with his robot
[5:07:01] <Gruhunchously> Uh oh...
[5:07:04] <Noogiez> remember to murder the orphans nicley tho
[5:07:20] <subjectg> @laserbeaming imagine having 50 SR, because that’s a thing in this
[5:07:49] <laserbeaming> @subjectg not that SR is very useful in this game with so few caster enemies
[5:07:49] <%RetroCop87> Can you find the mansion where you got the two families to kill each other?
[5:07:50] <AdmiralButtloaf> hes so shiny
[5:07:58] <%cafefunk> wtf are his eyes
[5:08:01] <Gruhunchously> LUL
[5:08:08] <%cafefunk> his eyes look like buttholes
[5:08:18] <%Huntercd> Is that space spanish?
[5:08:21] <+projectmanatees> They still got the crystal cave here?
[5:08:28] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> L I P S
[5:08:31] <Gruhunchously> @RetroCop87 That was in the last game
[5:08:50] <DaRoosta89> kariboo
[5:09:04] <%Blank9> ok he just said que pasa
[5:09:05] <subjectg> @laserbeaming yeah sadly, but it’s fun to think about how busted the numbers are compared to normal 3e
[5:09:10] <%catman042285> yep
[5:09:25] <%Fooguwu> these guys do have the same sort of resonance common in native spanish speakers
[5:09:38] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[5:09:44] <%Dunmarkh> LUL
[5:09:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[5:09:50] <tanarath> Pat...
[5:09:51] <rjhascancer> ruh roh raggy
[5:09:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Stop mashing Pat
[5:10:17] <Gruhunchously> LUL
[5:10:34] <laserbeaming> you can totally have a bunch of spare HK parts in the Restored Content Mod
[5:11:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Fun fact: this bitch stole my name.
[5:11:06] <laserbeaming> merkenaries
[5:11:08] <%AzureGale> Murk-a-naries
[5:11:39] <%wibbwobbler> what a crew
[5:12:25] <%Dunmarkh> yeah probably
[5:12:27] <slix3431> Hey Pat starwarz sux
[5:12:30] <$RealThiele> yes
[5:12:37] <%Dunmarkh> robot cool
[5:12:38] <Noogiez> get saber of light, you must
[5:12:49] <laserbeaming> how much do you want his quips?
[5:13:03] <laserbeaming> and how much do you want Disciple?
[5:13:05] <%Monkeyweed21> you need Bao Dur to hate you first
[5:13:07] <subjectg> @patstaresat the last part you need is balls deep in the nar shaddaa questline iirc
[5:13:11] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt There are HK-50s just one map away.
[5:13:13] <+TheBigO75> The answer with HK is always yes personally.
[5:13:18] <HotMafia81> That run animation does not scale well
[5:13:21] <%Dunmarkh> a lightsaber won't make your lightning stronger
[5:13:23] <%RaziWraith> but but but....pompous assasin droid with an attitude.
[5:13:30] <%wibbwobbler> hk pls
[5:13:41] <slix3431> Why are all these women squatting alone?
[5:13:43] <%Monkeyweed21> make Bao Dur hate you first
[5:13:44] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt There are HK-50s at the Jedi Enclave, you can go to them now.
[5:13:47] <%cafefunk> she just keeps twirling these swords
[5:13:55] <laserbeaming> no love for Atton?
[5:14:02] <+OG_M_Bison> What about Hand Maiden FeelsBadMan
[5:14:12] <Foymic> you know you that you know the game well when you can respond to a backseater with, nah ill get it later instead cause ita better
[5:14:18] <laserbeaming> Hand Maiden is not here
[5:14:28] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt You can grab it from HK-50s at the Jedi enclave
[5:14:32] <laserbeaming> we get good boi disciple though
[5:14:37] <+alternative_flu> run real fast like the sonic guy
[5:14:39] <@SoFarFetched> rolling around at the speed of sound
[5:14:40] <+OG_M_Bison> Either way will get you there so it doesn't matter
[5:14:43] <+alternative_flu> thats how you get there
[5:14:54] <%Monkeyweed21> do the game Pat
[5:14:54] <Noogiez> skip around like a jackass
[5:14:59] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt Pretty sure they do.
[5:15:03] <%snugglepuggs> take a taxi
[5:15:33] <For_Temeria> beefy dog
[5:15:33] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt It's just one level transition away.
[5:15:44] <%Garthunox> Pat are you doing any Ishgard Resto stuff?
[5:15:47] <%Agami23> the dogs here have the same stock dog noise as the ones in mabinogi.
[5:15:48] <AdmiralButtloaf> tough dogs
[5:16:22] <rjhascancer> look at those grass physics
[5:16:23] <+OG_M_Bison> They were hard to find
[5:16:29] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt YOU DID IT.
[5:16:36] <+Flambage> @PatStaresAt Any reason you didn't use the mod to get both Hand Maiden and Disciple?
[5:16:36] <scrublordsamurai> psaLiz
[5:16:41] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> thoughts on SWTOR? @PatStaresAt
[5:16:43] <slix3431> Pat go clap the dark side's cheeks
[5:16:44] <Hellarussian> living in the Star Wars universe must suck
[5:16:56] <%colouroftheiris77> colouroftheiris77 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Here's to 23 months! hopefully I'll get my hands on a PS5 before 2 years!
[5:16:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> Nice
[5:17:01] <Gruhunchously> Kinda, yeah.
[5:17:12] <%cafefunk> how long is the game usually take to win?
[5:17:12] <AdmiralButtloaf> hand maiden is male exclusive right?
[5:17:29] <+Flambage> @PatStaresAt No there a mod to have both. Not turning Visa in Hand Maiden
[5:17:30] <Gruhunchously> Waifu party
[5:17:33] <+alternative_flu> loot them corpse
[5:17:40] <Gruhunchously> "Annoying Recitation"
[5:17:42] <%cafefunk> it seems like a pretty long game
[5:17:49] <slix3431> Hey Pat, remember Sabulba?
[5:17:57] <%SirGO0SE> its time PogChamp
[5:18:07] <%wibbwobbler> hand maiden rules
[5:18:12] <+OG_M_Bison> Go for regenerating force points
[5:18:13] <Gruhunchously> Wooo
[5:18:14] <%SirGO0SE> get Force Kin
[5:18:24] <tanarath> Two weapon + Flurry or Crit
[5:18:29] <+OG_M_Bison> Bottom of the feat list
[5:18:42] <+OG_M_Bison> Your welcome :)
[5:18:42] <Gruhunchously> @cafefunk Yeah, I'd say about 40 hours.
[5:18:49] <%catman042285> Hk-47 is here
[5:18:51] <subjectg> Regenerate fp is garbo tho
[5:18:58] <subjectg> since you get so much fp anyway
[5:19:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Force Channel is a form.
[5:19:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's a force form.
[5:19:05] <+OG_M_Bison> @subjectg Is it?
[5:19:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> @too_much_nukie Knew it
[5:19:17] <+OG_M_Bison> I always ran out of force points until I got geared up
[5:19:21] <slix3431> Pat, recruit sabulba
[5:19:22] <%SirGO0SE> regenerate Force Kin
[5:19:24] <+hailinpea> Regen FP is good
[5:19:25] <Gruhunchously> It's a Force Form
[5:19:26] <%Alazull> I am t o r n torn
[5:19:31] <subjectg> @og_m_bison i wouldn’t object to it if this game wasn’t so easy
[5:19:34] <+UberWolfman> GOOGLE SAVE US
[5:19:39] <+OG_M_Bison> Once you have all the OP gear you regenerate a shit ton
[5:19:44] <+hailinpea> Spamming force l8ghtning will cost alot of fp
[5:19:57] <+OG_M_Bison> But until then it's kinda annoying
[5:20:06] <+hailinpea> Get it, trust
[5:20:10] <subjectg> this isn’t kotor 1 where you’re constantly looking for fp
[5:20:43] <+hailinpea> Yup
[5:20:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's double the speed.
[5:20:59] <subjectg> You’re out of combat
[5:21:01] <laserbeaming> @PatStaresAt Force Channel also passively increases your FP regen
[5:21:01] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt Something we learned from Woolie's LP, HK-47 likes it when you're mean to him.
[5:21:13] <+thatotherblackkid> Real Sith only use life drain
[5:21:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> FP regen is also doubled in-combat.
[5:21:30] <%catman042285> All the FP
[5:21:34] <laserbeaming> yes
[5:21:38] <laserbeaming> he loves it
[5:21:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> Very much so
[5:21:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> HK likes when you're an asshole in general.
[5:21:40] <+OG_M_Bison> I never ran out of force points even with the increased FP costs and damage stance in the end game
[5:21:42] <@SoFarFetched> FP for the PP
[5:21:46] <AdmiralButtloaf> bad goat
[5:21:48] <+hailinpea> The vombination of bot the feat and force channel, gives you insane regen rats
[5:21:49] <subjectg> HK is big stomped
[5:21:49] <%WhereIsWill> lot of ppl like the pp stomp in this game apparently XD
[5:21:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He also likes when you tell people you don't care what they have to say then initiate combat.
[5:21:55] <+OG_M_Bison> HK is a masochist and a sadist
[5:21:58] <%Alazull> Kill em all Peter
[5:21:58] <%Agami23> HK is like "if i had a mouth i'd want you to spit in it"
[5:22:01] <+thatotherblackkid> he loves it and he hates it when you're nice to him
[5:22:01] <Djinnazz> should'n you have a lightsaber by now?
[5:22:13] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> Why are all the companions such Masochist betas?
[5:22:18] <+OG_M_Bison> @Agami23 Thank you for this sentence LUL
[5:22:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Djinnazz No lol
[5:22:39] <laserbeaming> 106 s from 0 to Max with both Force Channel and FP Regen
[5:22:42] <+OG_M_Bison> What's your strength @PatStaresAt
[5:22:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat only needs one more part and it won't take him long to get it but he hasn't even done anything on Dantooine yet.
[5:22:54] <laserbeaming> From the original 900s
[5:22:56] <+OG_M_Bison> Cause I think chance to hit MIGHT scale off of strength
[5:23:11] <+hailinpea> ????
[5:23:31] <+corrosivePaladin> its fine he has big lightning
[5:23:32] <+OG_M_Bison> I think in Kotor 1 it was different but I'm not sure
[5:23:34] <%catman042285> whoot
[5:23:35] <+hailinpea> Finesse Melee weapon works on both melee and lightsabers
[5:23:38] <laserbeaming> At least it makes more sense than damage scaling with DEX
[5:23:38] <%AncelDeLambert> it's always been the part of D&D combat I've hated the most
[5:23:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> More Strong means faster swing
[5:23:40] <%Paperware> The stupid is aggressive
[5:23:43] <$RealThiele> dnd 3.0 woo
[5:23:44] <%Alazull> Yeah but that's how 3rd edition DnD works so?
[5:23:44] <subjectg> unless the mod fixed it, finesse:melee weapons should also give you lightsaber finesse
[5:23:45] <+hailinpea> Finesze lightsaber is a trap
[5:23:50] <+OG_M_Bison> Dex builds in this game are garbage I think
[5:23:50] <laserbeaming> I don't think so?
[5:23:54] <+hailinpea> unless you modded the game
[5:23:54] <+alternative_flu> what kindof waifu would hk-47 be
[5:23:56] <+OG_M_Bison> They were op in Kotor 1 tho
[5:24:02] <laserbeaming> I don't remember it working on both
[5:24:04] <%Romuken> STR based to-hit chance is being able to impact the enemy, DEX is finding a weak point to bypass the defenses.
[5:24:13] <+OG_M_Bison> @alternative_flu The robot kind like Hatsune Miku
[5:24:14] <%killsareFALL0UT> HK
[5:24:26] <%wibbwobbler> yo
[5:24:40] <+OG_M_Bison> Damn now I'm hard :(
[5:24:48] <+OG_M_Bison> Thanks HK
[5:24:50] <Lynxystem> Alazull i dont play dnd, but dont a lot of people say 3E is bad? lol
[5:24:53] <subjectg> close range?!
[5:25:02] <laserbeaming> @PatStaresAt huh, the Strategy Wiki does say Finesse Melee weapons affects both. Weird. Why is Finesse Lightsabers a thing then?
[5:25:06] <Gruhunchously> Ah, best boy.
[5:25:15] <subjectg> bug @laserbeaming
[5:25:29] <laserbeaming> good bug
[5:25:30] <Gruhunchously> @laserbeaming Bugs
[5:25:32] <%Blank9> 3.5e's probably 2nd most popular dnd behind 5e because it's most recent
[5:25:33] <+OG_M_Bison> @laserbeaming What does Finesse affect both mean then? Like scale off of strength and Dex?
[5:25:33] <thepeacemain> HBae-47
[5:26:05] <%Blank9> finesse means it makes melee weapons that'd normally be str-based scale off of the higher of str or dex
[5:26:05] <Gruhunchously> You're gonna want to sit down for this one, buddy.
[5:26:14] <laserbeaming> @laserbeaming You can add your DEX to attack for both lightsabers and melee
[5:26:21] <laserbeaming> with a single feat
[5:26:23] <+OG_M_Bison> Pat reading the lines are always the best LUL
[5:26:24] <%Alazull> @Lynxystem 4th edition was much worse, but yeah all of KotoR is based on 3rd edition D&D
[5:26:25] <%Mr_Pylon> oh he's gonna be so mad
[5:26:30] <%wibbwobbler> doodwesker
[5:26:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> @lynxystem 3E was a little jank, but 3.5 was the gold standard for a long time, to the point that Pathfinder was based off of it, is considered 3.75, and is still very popular.
[5:26:38] <%killsareFALL0UT> :(
[5:26:39] <+OG_M_Bison> @laserbeaming So strength and dex get added???? That's op right????
[5:26:48] <subjectg> finesse isn’t a total replacement, since you get extra damage with STR you don’t get with DEX
[5:26:50] <JetpackMcQuack> cyrSmug production ass droid
[5:26:59] <laserbeaming> no, you use DEX instead of STR
[5:27:04] <$RealThiele> just kill them
[5:27:07] <laserbeaming> for attack only
[5:27:09] <laserbeaming> not damage
[5:27:18] <Lynxystem> oh cool Alazull GeneralSCPatton thenks retroCOOL
[5:27:19] <+thatotherblackkid> so angry he launched sarcasm.exe
[5:27:22] <%Alazull> 3.5 was so well loved it became Pathfinder when WotC abandoned it
[5:27:25] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Make absolutely sure HK is in your party next time you fight the evil HK unites.
[5:27:26] <%WhereIsWill> meatbags LUL
[5:27:27] <laserbeaming> not that you need extra STR damage if you're using lightsabers
[5:27:29] <+corrosivePaladin> i love his sass so much
[5:27:35] <+OG_M_Bison> @subjectg This happened to me on my Wisdom build. I had some dex but NO strength and I did absolutely NO melee damage. I did a shit ton of forced damage tho
[5:27:37] <+alternative_flu> the gamer word
[5:27:38] <%killsareFALL0UT> meatbags
[5:27:45] <HotMafia81> This MF was born into the world sick of your shit
[5:27:51] <%FacetiousAF> humans are SHIT - MrDestructoid
[5:27:56] <$RealThiele> hates no?
[5:28:03] <%juxtest> There are sevveral meatbags on this very ship that you can go ham on just give the word
[5:28:04] <+gaemjurnalist> M E A T B A G S
[5:28:11] <%Monkeyweed21> He doesn't like it when you act all nice n shit
[5:28:19] <+OG_M_Bison> @alternative_flu Which one? monkaS
[5:28:21] <subjectg> @laserbeaming hey man, every number counts. I think in this game it also adds damage with a multiplier rather than just the STR mod
[5:28:33] <%Mr_Pylon> only the best for HK
[5:28:37] <Gruhunchously> HK is going to looove us.
[5:28:47] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt HK is ready to talk to all meatbag managers
[5:28:50] <$RealThiele> just do that good ol weapon focus power atk str build with imp critical and destroy
[5:29:06] <+OG_M_Bison> I think the extra strength matter if you're playing a jedi with shitty alignment modifiers on your sith powers
[5:29:15] <ChungusQuest> droids have an off hand?
[5:29:23] <+corrosivePaladin> levelup robot?
[5:29:31] <+OG_M_Bison> @ChungusQuest Yes
[5:29:32] <laserbeaming> @subjectg it's pretty good if you're dual wielding. You don't get the x0.5 penalty on your off hand IIRC.
[5:29:35] <subjectg> @patstaresat give HK weapons with good crit, he gets bonus damage off them
[5:29:41] <+OG_M_Bison> HK and the astrodroid can dual wield
[5:29:48] <tanarath> str matters if you're a guardian, but...
[5:29:56] <%Romuken> Judgement Storm is a freaking SICC name but just a light-side taser power
[5:30:03] <+OG_M_Bison> @PatStaresAt In the feats screen right?
[5:30:06] <Djinnazz> i dont think so
[5:30:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt The feats page
[5:30:14] <%Alazull> Look at their character cheet
[5:30:16] <%CatastropheCorvid> Feats
[5:30:17] <+Ghufufin> Ghufufin subscribed with Prime. 
[5:30:17] <%Alazull> *sheet
[5:30:20] <laserbeaming> HK gets a lot of Crit based stuff
[5:30:21] <+OG_M_Bison> I think it's at the bottom of the feats screen
[5:30:22] <subjectg> @patstaresat powers/feats/skill page
[5:30:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt They're all unique feats the characters have. You don't see it on level up though because they're not available to pick on level up
[5:30:26] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt Reload that last conversation
[5:30:28] <laserbeaming> his crits hurt
[5:30:31] <tanarath> biiiiig crits
[5:30:59] <+OG_M_Bison> Does sniper shot add to critical chance? I can't remember
[5:31:00] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt There was unique dialogue
[5:31:07] <subjectg> @patstaresat massive criticals adds to your crit damage, not crit chance. You need something with Keen to add crit chance
[5:31:15] <tanarath> @og_m_bison it mutiplies it
[5:31:22] <%Monkeyweed21> stop rushing and mind goblining
[5:31:35] <tanarath> It doubles/triples/quarduples the chance
[5:31:39] <+OG_M_Bison> @tanarath Would you rather run sniper shot or multishot on HK then? I ran multi
[5:31:51] <tanarath> crit
[5:31:53] <%killsareFALL0UT> damn
[5:31:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yep he loves it
[5:31:54] <subjectg> Sniper shot is good for HK, i’ve always preferred rapid shot with good crits anyway
[5:31:56] <Gruhunchously> Random Cruelty Generator
[5:31:57] <%AzureGale> Wowowowowow
[5:31:59] <+OG_M_Bison> @subjectg That's why you should modify the guns to add a higher crit range right?
[5:32:01] <$RealThiele> awe HK
[5:32:05] <%Aeoneth> Is HK simping for Kah'Ren
[5:32:06] <tanarath> crit is much stronger in 2
[5:32:09] <rjhascancer> I like this guy
[5:32:11] <laserbeaming> I love him
[5:32:12] <Djinnazz> score!
[5:32:15] <%SirGO0SE> he LOVES harming innocents :)
[5:32:16] <+nirvana227> jaeeWheeze
[5:32:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yup
[5:32:21] <%juxtest> Violence is my middle name
[5:32:26] <%Dunmarkh> yeah it's really quiet
[5:32:26] <ChungusQuest> yeah that was whisper-quiet
[5:32:27] <+OG_M_Bison> @PatStaresAt No you're not. This game has some ASS sound mixing
[5:32:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's now a very quiet evil
[5:32:28] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> no thats a thing
[5:32:29] <+jmcclellan18> Yeah the sound seemed super low
[5:32:29] <%Srthunda> barely heard it
[5:32:29] <laserbeaming> I think we're all insane
[5:32:30] <%Alazull> It's super quiet now
[5:32:30] <%VoidBaronJules> no you''re right
[5:32:31] <AdmiralButtloaf> you got used to it
[5:32:31] <+Skelegroove> Quiet evil
[5:32:33] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, it got quiet all of a sudden
[5:32:33] <tanarath> An extra attack scales down, because you get more.
[5:32:38] <+alternative_flu> mods?
[5:32:39] <%YakumoYomi> It sounded like it was in the distance
[5:32:40] <%Agami23> no, thats a thing. you aren't crazy
[5:32:45] <+corrosivePaladin> your evil is so huge its silenced the song
[5:32:45] <KeiPrime> smol evil
[5:32:46] <%RaziWraith> Your character is use to the dark side flowing through him.
[5:32:51] <%Alazull> Maybe because it knows your commitment to evil
[5:32:52] <%RaziWraith> her*
[5:32:57] <+OG_M_Bison> Like if you force lightning multiple enemies it also multiplies the sound of the effect so your force lightning gets LOUD AS FUCK
[5:33:07] <+OG_M_Bison> @alternative_flu Weapon mods
[5:33:09] <+gaemjurnalist> aw darth kae'ren and her pet murder-droid
[5:33:13] <$RealThiele> this is just bender and fry
[5:33:16] <@SoFarFetched> I guess that's why he's okay with you being mean
[5:33:19] <@SoFarFetched> if he feels pain is truth
[5:33:27] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Dark side sound knows to keep its distance from you now
[5:33:38] <+OG_M_Bison> @gaemjurnalist TRUE LUL
[5:33:43] <+alternative_flu> @alternative_flu a'ight cool thanks
[5:34:21] <notsoy> YES HK time
[5:34:34] <Gruhunchously> This dialogue is the best
[5:34:49] <+nirvana227> lmaooo
[5:34:54] <+OG_M_Bison> Has anyone else heard the Lion King theory that scar eats Mufasa? That shit's weird
[5:35:15] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> Getting called the worst Jedi ever when Vrook is in this game SMH
[5:35:18] <%SolidusRex> HK-47 would make a good member of Castle Super Beast
[5:35:21] <+OG_M_Bison> Changing your pigmentation???? cmonBruh
[5:35:22] <%SirGO0SE> that file on Pat's desktop labeled "Not Pornography"? It's actually HK JOI
[5:35:28] <%Agami23> he has a point.
[5:35:33] <+corrosivePaladin> wait HK loves his rusty red?
[5:35:47] <+alternative_flu> hk-47 racist towards hk-50 units?
[5:35:48] <+OG_M_Bison> @corrosivePaladin Why wouldn't he LUL
[5:35:52] <KeiPrime> red like dried blud
[5:36:01] <+OG_M_Bison> @alternative_flu YUS
[5:36:01] <ChungusQuest> he's perfectly calibrated
[5:36:05] <+corrosivePaladin> i love this robot so much more
[5:36:15] <Gruhunchously> This is beautiful. This is art.
[5:36:37] <subjectg> @patstaresat fun trivia, HK-47 doesn’t have the same modifiers to his speech as the 50s, like “condescending” or “chiding”
[5:36:46] <+OG_M_Bison> @Gruhunchously This whole game is a piece of art
[5:36:50] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt by the by HK is the best boss fight in vanilla TOR.
[5:37:21] <+OG_M_Bison> @Alazull I tried playing through TOR but I couldn't do it
[5:37:34] <TheReaperofGrim> Man HK really is the best
[5:37:35] <RogueKnightXIII> Lol is HK using Ebony and Ivory from the devil may cry series?
[5:37:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Again, make damn sure HK is in your party each time you fight his dopplegangers.
[5:37:59] <subjectg> “It is locked by plot, Master.”
[5:38:01] <+OG_M_Bison> @RogueKnightXIII He should be
[5:38:15] <tanarath> @og_m_bison Go sith agent/sorc/warrior
[5:38:19] <+OG_M_Bison> @Too_Much_Nukie You only need to do it like 2 or 3 times but yea
[5:38:24] <tanarath> It's WoW, though
[5:38:43] <Djinnazz> nope
[5:38:44] <+OG_M_Bison> @tanarath I did. I don't have a reason for stopping I just did for no reason
[5:38:45] <%Ranryu692> and they can't fight him
[5:38:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No he can not.
[5:38:49] <%Blank9> statement: wat
[5:38:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> But they can not fight him either.
[5:38:54] <%ScholarlyButtlicker> ScholarlyButtlicker subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Enjoying the stream. Stay classy.
[5:38:58] <TheReaperofGrim> They cant fight him either
[5:39:00] <subjectg> Self-preservation protocols baby
[5:39:08] <Gruhunchously> Interesting....
[5:39:15] <tanarath> Fair, it's shit
[5:39:20] <Gruhunchously> I wonder who did that?
[5:39:20] <HotMafia81> Flippant Dismissal: mmmmmbitchhhhhhhhh!
[5:40:30] <notsoy> wow kae'ren skin is not cracked anymore
[5:40:32] <notsoy> what happened
[5:40:34] <%BinaryFireball> man I wish droids took over the starwars universe
[5:40:43] <%BinaryFireball> just like fuck biobeings
[5:40:48] <%BinaryFireball> robots rule now
[5:40:53] <%SirGO0SE> @notsoy yeah what did happen..
[5:40:55] <notsoy> fuck meatbags
[5:41:00] <tanarath> @notsoy Pat went dark side later for visas
[5:41:09] <%BinaryFireball> meatbags like smell
[5:41:11] <%BinaryFireball> and sweat
[5:41:14] <%cafefunk> you think Kreia is a secret Hatsune Miku fan
[5:41:21] <%BinaryFireball> and make less than perfect shapes and noises
[5:41:22] <+xen0riddley> good evening everyone
[5:41:24] <notsoy> imagine if a whole Star Wars series was about HK and T3
[5:41:25] <+OG_M_Bison> Also I didn't know that The Exhile and Revan both have canonical genders
[5:41:29] <+reallybigrocks> Kae'Ren upped her skincare game and truly earned the name Drippo
[5:41:59] <@SoFarFetched> D:
[5:42:02] <@SoFarFetched> how wude
[5:42:04] <dead_drew> hey pat
[5:42:05] <notsoy> an HK/T3 buddy-cop series would be one of the best things Star Wars could get
[5:42:08] <Gruhunchously> :(
[5:42:25] <+Siobhan_deMarisco> the line reading on trash compacter was great
[5:42:27] <%BinaryFireball> booo pat meatbag
[5:42:28] <+OG_M_Bison> @notsoy Baby legs and Regular legs
[5:42:34] <dead_drew> he sounds different
[5:42:45] <%BinaryFireball> darth karen can love droids
[5:42:48] <%thedankestmeeme> hey did yoiu know the karma chameleon person is a GUY
[5:42:54] <%thedankestmeeme> news for your eyes
[5:42:56] <dead_drew> I've been watching to much of the old channel
[5:43:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Wait, Boy George is a guy?
[5:43:27] <+OG_M_Bison> @thedankestmeeme Like the singer of the song? I always thought that was a dude LUL
[5:43:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> My god, who could have guessed.
[5:43:43] <%thedankestmeeme> yeh the singer is a dude
[5:43:52] <notsoy> LMFAOOOOO
[5:43:55] <%thedankestmeeme> yes he is a boy
[5:43:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt There are kids in your chat dude.
[5:44:06] <notsoy> HK is such a gem
[5:44:11] <%thedankestmeeme> hey man he's on the blurred lione
[5:44:12] <+gaemjurnalist> i love this robot
[5:44:14] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> Statement: Perhaps if Master eliminated their yee yee ass haircut, Master would recieves females to copulate with. Or perhaps Master Revan would be willing to fornicate your womp rat ass if they weren't currently fucking with a a Sith Emperor or Jedi or some equivilent... Meatbag...
[5:44:16] <%thedankestmeeme> i dont like to judge
[5:44:29] <CursedNobleman> @JonThePrettyOKGuy LYL
[5:44:32] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[5:44:33] <+OG_M_Bison> It's an 18+ rated stream. Kids can't be in here
[5:44:40] <notsoy> oh no is this a dialogue loop
[5:44:57] <nertia420> this has to be someones kink right
[5:44:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> D:
[5:45:00] <Gruhunchously> T3
[5:45:04] <%Monkeyweed21> t3 influence
[5:45:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> @JonThePrettyOKGuy You ain't gotta like it cuz the Hood gon love it!
[5:45:05] <%Blank9> that was t3, not hk
[5:45:05] <Djinnazz> Pat no!
[5:45:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat read it.
[5:45:06] <notsoy> oh no you pissed off the trash compactor
[5:45:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That was T3
[5:45:10] <%Dunmarkh> you don't love t3?
[5:45:14] <%arancet> this is going to be a long playthrough
[5:45:15] <Gruhunchously> You lost influence with T3
[5:45:15] <subjectg> That was T3
[5:45:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[5:45:25] <%Dunmarkh> PAT YOU ILLITERATE GOBLIN
[5:45:26] <+corrosivePaladin> pat cant read ohno
[5:45:27] <+alternative_flu> good luck with your pee!
[5:45:29] <Admiral_PopnFresh> D: but T3 though
[5:45:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> We did it you guys- we made it to Big Tiddy Sith waifu.
[5:46:07] <Gruhunchously> And murder robot waifu..
[5:46:44] <+projectmanatees> Question: There must be a program that lets you talk like hk right?
[5:47:35] <%Alazull> Condescending answer: Of course there is
[5:47:46] <%SirGO0SE> darth boobas
[5:47:47] <Gruhunchously> Conjecture: It is possible that such a program could exist. Perhaps we could find it.
[5:48:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> Just remembered that the Elcor copy his projected speech patterns
[5:50:17] <%Alazull> cheer500
[5:51:03] <+OG_M_Bison> The change of scenery will be nice
[5:51:52] <redrins> feet
[5:51:55] <%miguelrod777> FEET?!
[5:51:56] <%SirGO0SE> hehe feet page
[5:51:57] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> Feet page. Lol
[5:51:59] <%Mrbaconator> feet
[5:52:02] <%SGrim> feet paige Kreygasm
[5:52:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Feet page?
[5:52:23] <%miguelrod777> Paige's feet?
[5:52:35] <+OG_M_Bison> Yea ranged weapons go all dex and con
[5:52:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> Dex and Con
[5:52:38] <subjectg> all into dex
[5:52:47] <subjectg> no con, only dex
[5:52:55] <+WorldsBestPanda> All charisma, to help with his one-liners.
[5:53:06] <+OG_M_Bison> Yea prob don't need the con technically
[5:53:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They're not.
[5:53:14] <Admiral_PopnFresh> ???
[5:53:14] <abelincoln_catpuncher> gotta go double pistols
[5:53:16] <%Alazull> Not for HK
[5:53:18] <%Monkeyweed21> baster lifles
[5:53:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Everyone is dumb.
[5:53:24] <subjectg> They’re not very good
[5:53:24] <+WorldsBestPanda> Anything can be good enough really.
[5:53:31] <%SolidusRex> Dual Wielding Pistols is better
[5:53:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> Gotta weigh the pros and the cons
[5:53:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There are a lot of great blaster rifles.
[5:53:36] <+OG_M_Bison> They were okay for me. They didn't do so well for me when I got to a certain solo mission tho
[5:53:54] <Gruhunchously> Pistols have more exploit potential.
[5:53:57] <subjectg> dual pistols is good, but rifles need rapid shot to work
[5:54:16] <subjectg> if you’re going sniper shot with HK, use dual pistols
[5:54:19] <%Alazull> Dual wielding does typically mean double potential stat boosts
[5:54:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You don't need multiple attacks with a crit build.
[5:54:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's a lot better for him to be focused on crits than on multi-hit attacks with lowered accuracy.
[5:54:50] <%Alazull> But HK is pretty good with a rifle
[5:54:54] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, if you crit-stack HK, he can chew through pretty much anything.
[5:54:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[5:54:58] <%Monkeyweed21> lotta feet talk
[5:54:58] <+OG_M_Bison> You could prob go either way tbh
[5:55:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Blasters are more accurate than dual-wield builds.
[5:55:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> 2 guns are twice as cool
[5:55:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Blaster rifles yes.
[5:55:34] <+OG_M_Bison> Google is always correct YEP
[5:55:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's the real reason people don't like blaster rifles in this game. They just think two guns is cool.
[5:55:53] <+reallybigrocks> How to build your very own assassin droid
[5:55:58] <subjectg> Dual wield build is sick, to-hit chances are really high in this game
[5:55:59] <abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah i guess it does make sense to go for constant crits
[5:56:01] <%SolidusRex> >Not wanting to build HK-47 IRL
[5:56:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> How to build HK? Ask Revan.
[5:56:16] <subjectg> You get way more DPS out of dual pistols because you get more attacks
[5:56:19] <abelincoln_catpuncher> I just love dual wielding rippers and melting fools
[5:56:20] <%Ranryu692> it's true
[5:56:20] <+OnwardEch0> wild how i used to paly this game with NO guides back in the day, and still soemhow beat it
[5:56:23] <+projectmanatees> Statement: you love his murder
[5:56:32] <subjectg> And there are some REALLY good pistols in this one
[5:56:33] <+OG_M_Bison> I just googled it. double pistols is max ranged damage in the game
[5:56:35] <%Alazull> what if you just did his dialogue tonight and levelled him up after you read some guides next time?
[5:56:51] <%wibbwobbler> pistol
[5:57:09] <subjectg> Don’t listen to that FAQ, they’re dumb for leveling CON
[5:57:11] <%Mr_Pylon> yay Rifle
[5:57:12] <+OG_M_Bison> @Alazull You're a fool if you think Pat thinks this way LUL
[5:57:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> Do what you love man
[5:57:20] <faithless_zealot> I would say listen to Too Much Nukie, he actually sounds like he played the game
[5:57:20] <+reallybigrocks> Fuckin do it, you won't
[5:57:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @subjectg The fuck are you talking about? HK starts with almost no health.
[5:57:29] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[5:57:33] <Gruhunchously> That's the right attitude to have.
[5:57:44] <subjectg> The game’s easy enough, so in the words of ivan cheznekov, RIFLE IS FINE
[5:57:51] <%Alazull> @og_m_bison I can still suggest it my guy
[5:58:03] <+OG_M_Bison> @Alazull True
[5:58:16] <%SirGO0SE> yeah this game is so easy that i cant believe youre trying to optimize lol
[5:58:25] <subjectg> @too_much_nukie DEX and good armor will pump his AC through the roof, and you can always get toughness to make up for it
[5:58:27] <%SirGO0SE> just do the pew pew that you like
[5:58:31] <%cafefunk> hey who here is gonna get the new Guilty Gear
[5:58:35] <+OG_M_Bison> I just got flash backs to the Dragon Age stream when you mentioned it @Alazull LUL

[5:58:47] <+OG_M_Bison> HOLY SHIT
[5:58:48] <faithless_zealot> Nice
[5:58:49] <+OG_M_Bison> SUBS
[5:58:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @subjectg You just said that hit rates in this game were super high, AC is almost useless at high levels.
[5:58:57] <Sogeki_Dan> Hey pat, I'm talking with a guy who worked on TLOU2 and I said "Games could get higher FPS rates if they stop putting in things like motion blur and other crappy effects" and he said "These actually don't really contribute to FPS because they are largely in post these days" Am I wrong?
[5:59:03] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[5:59:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And low levels too.
[5:59:04] <subjectg> @too_much_nukie not to mention the horrendous amount of droid energy shields you get means you never need to give HK more hp
[5:59:06] <%goose_attack_almanac> HK IS SO EVIL I LOVE IT
[5:59:06] <+reallybigrocks> Pat must destroy any semblance of difficulty because goblins
[5:59:09] <Gruhunchously> We're all here to see a man torture himself
[5:59:16] <subjectg> @too_much_nukie hit rates for YOURSELF, not the enemies
[5:59:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> But you're wrong then.
[5:59:28] <%goose_attack_almanac> You can't dangle Numbers in Pat's face and not have him try to optimize
[6:00:01] <%goose_attack_almanac> oh did that make 100 gift subs?
[6:00:07] <%goose_attack_almanac> nifty
[6:00:25] <%goose_attack_almanac> Give that droid a gun
[6:00:30] <+reallybigrocks> big gun go pew
[6:00:31] <+BettyMwwaahh> he looks dumb with dual pistols
[6:00:31] <subjectg> @too_much_nukie what i mean is you get to stack to-hit modifiers for your weapons so missing is very unlikely. The same cannot be said for most ranged enemies in this game
[6:00:36] <%SirGO0SE> psaGoblin ALWAYS win
[6:00:43] <CursedNobleman> LOSERS GO FIRST.
[6:00:48] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Jesus Atton has seen better days
