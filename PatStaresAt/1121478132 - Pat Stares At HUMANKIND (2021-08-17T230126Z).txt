[0:16:18] <deviljhojho_> Why tho
[0:16:18] <%Valdorick> So... Steam Reviews.
[0:16:19] <gustavozxd> at least you got to form your own opinion first
[0:16:19] <MyNameIsRasus> @TIME_PUNCHER the only reason i know that is because of the "space 4x" jeice bit in dbza

[0:16:28] <cureneckbeard> every review is "this game sucks because it's not Master of Orion 2 and nothing will ever be"
[0:16:28] <+MisterAvry> yeah valid
[0:16:30] <+HollywoodZach> 4Chan shitbird trolls. There was like 4 threads about it
[0:16:30] <%SovPho> people that review games that early, especially 4x games, are like... damaged.

[0:16:58] <lonosis47> Why the hell did I just a HUMANKIND ad for this stream? Pat just say youre being  sponsored
[0:17:02] <sirtommygunn> people like different things!
[0:17:03] <+sonofthedeepsouth> CIV 5 IS GREAT
[0:17:03] <+Mrbaconator> give em the stick DON'T GIVEM THE STICK
[0:17:06] <deviljhojho_> but i dont want to play civ 5, i want to play humankind
[0:17:06] <%Ne1son> Not even go play Civ 6
[0:17:07] <%AzureGale> It's like the reviews are done by a bunch of a different people
[0:17:11] <%boxboten> everyone who plays 4x's is required to have opinions
[0:17:12] <stantheman_97> so more up to taste?
[0:17:12] <%boxboten> its the rules
[0:17:14] <%The_Protagonist> wh-
[0:17:14] <+rafaelba93> its a little different from civ but once you learn it it gets great
[0:17:16] <%kingofasgard> go play civ 4
[0:17:20] <%patriotrenegade> I‚Äôve never played Civ
[0:17:22] <%greencapps> greencapps subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Wow 3 months, also just finished the Heavensward DRK quest line and man it's crazy how much more intresting all the characters in this optional storyline is than like most of what's in the msq up to where I am now. Anyways pet the babies for me.
[0:17:25] <%NovaKnightmare> tbh I want that as an option
[0:17:26] <Profmcstevie> 4X people might be the most filthy humans
[0:17:29] <%Agami23> civ fans are psychos
[0:17:32] <%Dakuu75> that's a "Go outside and play" game
[0:17:32] <%flying_hipp0> hello scatman
[0:17:32] <%JoshManVGH> lol Civ too short! Need 40 bagilzion turns!
[0:17:33] <Consumanist> thought you were about to say 600 dollars for some reason
[0:17:34] <+MisterAvry> not worth getting FURIOUS over, but let the people do what they want
[0:17:34] <$Futurecity10> Civ Fans are cunts, trust me I know
[0:17:34] <+alphonseisbest> whats that i hours?
[0:17:36] <+Sendrak70> If you need a 600+ turn game. You need to play 600 turns, then go outside for 600 more.
[0:17:40] <Daxalog> Does playing Pacifist or Diplomatic require a long game?
[0:17:50] <%Ipsenscastle> Civ players are the Melee players of videogames
[0:17:50] <%doctordinkus> 4X people only ever crawl out of their caves to mock MOBA people
[0:17:50] <+Mrbaconator> CEASE HAVING FUN
[0:17:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Amplitude is amazing at UI design the problem with their games is that the combat always sucks
[0:17:55] <+TheBigO75> Yeah, just go play Stellaris if you're going to long play a 4x game.
[0:17:55] <$zyberion626> @patstaresat you can totally play beyond 600 turns
[0:17:56] <%Anime_Flux> LUL
[0:18:00] <%patriotrenegade> Civ fans need to go outside and touch some grass
[0:18:00] <cureneckbeard> Reviewers are wrong but they are also very loud so who knows
[0:18:01] <+sonofthedeepsouth> No
[0:18:01] <%AzureGale> "... and I took that personally"
[0:18:01] <+rafaelba93> nahh, its good
[0:18:01] <Hoaxfish> "the UI is horrible" LOL
[0:18:02] <+alphonseisbest> whats 600 turns in hours? for us dumbos
[0:18:03] <gustavozxd> crazy talked into thinking you had fun
[0:18:04] <BliVru> No joke I find Reddit of all things being more useful for reviews
[0:18:06] <+sonofthedeepsouth> U CANNOT HAVE FUN
[0:18:06] <stantheman_97> is a fun a lie?
[0:18:06] <lonosis47> Pat cant make his own opiniosn NotLikeThis
[0:18:07] <sirtommygunn> there should be an unlimited/sandbox mode but its not a huge issue
[0:18:08] <kazadaz> There are people who play Total War games with mods that multiply the turn count by TWELVE, and all the research/construction times by the same
[0:18:08] <%pilgrimsayswhat> YOUR FUN IS WRONG
[0:18:10] <@ssjklyco> It seems your mileage may vary
[0:18:11] <+Rinoka> being gaslit by steam reviews is a new low
[0:18:14] <%Wurmspawn> No pat! Haven't you played Risk or Axis and Allies, if a strategy game doesn't require you to religate an entire room to it for months on end, YOU AREN'T Playing it right! (Heavy sarcasm is implied)
[0:18:17] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Civ 5 fans are the Melee fans of 4X
[0:18:17] <%GabeSweetMan> DESIST WITH FUN HAVING. You are diverging from the concensus!
[0:18:21] <+LoliSuperSlam> I can't believe Pat Crazy Talked himself into not having fun
[0:18:22] <%patriotrenegade> You had fun, but in the wrong way
[0:18:27] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[0:18:28] <%maskofmichael> Cheer500 I recently watched Garth Marenghi's Darkplace and it is hilarious. It's a shame that it ended only after six episodes. Personally I would love to see a sequel series about an in-universe remake of the series only for Garth Marenghi to show up and makes thing ""better"".
[0:18:29] <Daxalog> 1 and 2?
[0:18:29] <%JoshManVGH> How long does a game take to hit a win condition compared to other civ games?
[0:18:40] <%Monkeyweed21> yea
[0:18:41] <+TestAnon> It's a lot better than civ 6 at launch but probably not better than civ 6 now
[0:18:45] <Ardailec> Amplitude game's UI is very polarizing. You either like the sleek "Here is all the info, there is no clutter but by god it's a lot of it" or you don't.
[0:18:46] <gustavozxd> oh hey nier reincarnation
[0:18:46] <Consumanist> after 60 hours i realized i wasn't having fun
[0:18:46] <$Futurecity10> Endless space 2 combat is weird
[0:18:47] <deviljhojho_> arent you supposed to ignore online reviews unless they are about bugs and shit anyways lol
[0:18:47] <%RyTYoung> RyTYoung subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! Hey Pat! Glad to hear you're enjoying Prey, will you check out the DLC? I've not tried them myself but "Mooncrash" apparently has rogue-like elements to it. Hope you have a good stream! :D
[0:18:49] <kazadaz> Space yu-gi-oh
[0:18:49] <+ThomasOfTroy> I REALLY liked the combat in the Humankind beta, it was one of the big draws for me
[0:18:50] <%flying_hipp0> endless space is baller but combat is GARBAGE
[0:18:53] <%Valdorick> There is ONE complaint I have about Amplitude's UI's... and its that some of their game's UIs are *too fucking sterile*, put some character into it!
[0:18:58] <%kingofasgard> to be fair many 4Xs' problems don't show up in the first couple hours
[0:19:02] <countyarc216> Have you every played Stellaris?
[0:19:02] <+rafaelba93> i did not like tge UI at first but once I got used to it everything went fine
[0:19:07] <%Ipsenscastle> @maskofmichael there was a sequel talk show called 'Man to Man with Dean Learner', but it was pretty bad
[0:19:11] <%crimsonharvest> its so fuckin slow to get though any serious war
[0:19:11] <%Ches_Neckbeard> civ as a series has always had bad combat
[0:19:11] <Hoaxfish> 4X combat is almost always bad
[0:19:13] <%Halospaz117> Yeah Civ's combat is pretty basic
[0:19:18] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Shilling a guys game Stellar  Warfare is in Early Access now. It looks pretty good, but I haven't played it as I want to wait for the completed version
[0:19:19] <+ThomasOfTroy> Civ combat is awful and boring frankly, and it sucks they've never seemed to fix it
[0:19:25] <+D00msDayDan> just play umbral choir and never even see combat
[0:19:26] <sirtommygunn> Civ5 got it to "slightly interesting" and it needed to go beyond that
[0:19:34] <+YaBish311> It‚Äôs bread and butter ya know
[0:19:44] <%somekindofsam> carpet of death
[0:19:45] <%Monkeyweed21> Civ combat is really basic but at least its fast and doesnt get in the way
[0:19:46] <%hewlettfan96> Heyy Paaat
[0:19:46] <MrPandastic> Endless Legend is probably still my favorite 4X game personally.
[0:19:47] <+rafaelba93> i like civs combat more still
[0:19:47] <%Valdorick> Your ancient caveman armies are fighting over the breadth of the fucking Maginot line.
[0:19:48] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah moving units in civ 5 was such a fucking chore
[0:19:48] <+horsesaredumb> 6 has stacking now i thought
[0:19:51] <+YaBish311> Perfect entryway to other 4x
[0:19:55] <%kingofasgard> your armies could block each other, it's so dumb
[0:20:05] <+sonofthedeepsouth> PAT LOVE SIT
[0:20:07] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Tropico is better
[0:20:08] <+Mrbaconator> endless legend is real good
[0:20:12] <not_twitter_rowan> @horsesaredumb 6 can combine identical units together to create armies and crop
[0:20:17] <$hattrick61> this games buy the Endless guys?
[0:20:17] <%flying_hipp0> civ combat is better than endless but that isn't a high bar
[0:20:23] <%Halospaz117> Oh I like that
[0:20:24] <%Wurmspawn> Especially with units like the artilery where you have to move, staple them into place, and then NEXT turn they can actually fire.
[0:20:26] <$hattrick61> by
[0:20:27] <+TestAnon> how religion works in civ 6 makes that like 5 times worse
[0:20:27] <%SovPho> lol greg abott has covid
[0:20:28] <AmkoTheTerrible> Civ 4 is better than 5 and 6 and i hope Humankind can finally be a worthy successor
[0:20:33] <%Valdorick> Also, you can beat up elephants. 10/10
[0:20:33] <+horsesaredumb> @not_twitter_rowan yeah 4 was just pure bullshit stacks I forgot
[0:20:36] <Daxalog> Like Endless Legend?
[0:20:36] <kingofasgard> like endless legend then
[0:20:41] <zerointelligence000> elephants are medieval tanks
[0:20:46] <%Monkeyweed21> and then Endless Legend has you fight a kinda bad HoMM fight
[0:20:48] <not_twitter_rowan> I actually like that about CivVI, because obviously you can't fit infinite armies into a single space
[0:20:48] <%TIME_PUNCHER> How many humans do you think it would take to punch an elephant to death
[0:21:01] <hewwogames> endless legend minus rad fantasy scifi shit
[0:21:01] <Conscript_Gary> I like one unit per hex but it's pretty valid if you don't
[0:21:02] <evbites> @TIME_PUNCHER 2000
[0:21:05] <$hattrick61> endless legend has unit limits in armies
[0:21:08] <%JoshManVGH> How long is a game of Humankind typically?
[0:21:08] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Stellar Warfare is in early Access
[0:21:09] <GenericEric797> I really like the combat in endless legends
[0:21:09] <@commanderclaw> Unlike Endless Legend you have direct control over your units rather than just giving general orders
[0:21:13] <+TestAnon> it is but a lot less micromanaging items and stats
[0:21:28] <@Lion_kun> Fuck you Gandhi
[0:21:29] <+ThomasOfTroy> Stellar Warfare looks rough and jank
[0:21:33] <not_twitter_rowan> For me it's the exact opposite, it's the Amplitude combat that constantly turns me off of their games honestly
[0:21:39] <%TIME_PUNCHER> I hear that the warfare is stellar
[0:21:41] <%crimsonharvest> idk firaxis is a disaster of an interface every time
[0:21:42] <%kingofasgard> @commanderclaw oh thank arse, that killed EL for me
[0:21:43] <%Monkeyweed21> @commanderclaw oh thank god that was the worst part of Endless Legend combat
[0:21:52] <%Agami23> sins of the solar empire has a really really good name
[0:21:54] <%SaiyanShoto> I have a bias against RTS games cause when I was a kid I got that alien vs predator rts game thinking it was an action or FPS game and was majorly disappointed
[0:21:57] <gustavozxd> one of those huh
[0:21:59] <+TestAnon> @PatStaresAt I heard a lot of reviewers recommend Old World, too bad it's EGS exclusive LOL
[0:22:00] <+CaptainLoin> Sins is an amazing game cursed by its 32 bit .exe
[0:22:02] <+D00msDayDan> i looked at some gameplay of stellar warfare and it looks like homeworld but boring
[0:22:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Doesnt every game do that tho? Kappa
[0:22:06] <countyarc216> Like EVE?
[0:22:10] <gustavozxd> pretty sure 4x games are that for me
[0:22:10] <viciousgrim> play Stellaris with mods
[0:22:11] <terrorengine> sounds about right
[0:22:13] <hewwogames> SoaSE is very cool tbh
[0:22:14] <Daxalog> Did you ever try Sword of the Stars?
[0:22:18] <%xbalmorax> xbalmorax subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! PatGlaresAt bad video games

[0:22:54] <+SinisterBroccoli> I honestly just don't like this entire genre
[0:22:55] <%mike2hands> Is this #sponsor?
[0:22:56] <%Valdorick> As someone who LIKES Stellaris, Stellaris is an oof for streaming and brain goblins.
[0:22:59] <%crimsonharvest> its a game about waiting its very boring
[0:23:01] <tanarath> sucks, I hope humankind works
[0:23:02] <%Monkeyweed21> fair its hit or miss
[0:23:05] <%Sotetsu> I loooove Stellaris
[0:23:06] <%SpontaneousC> have you played stellaris recently because they literally remake the fucking game every god damn year
[0:23:09] <kazadaz> Play Vicky 3 with the Stellaris mod
[0:23:11] <+probably_facetious> Most people who play Stellaris hate it, too, in my experience.
[0:23:13] <%kingofasgard> stellaris was great in 1.9, and has gone downhill ever since
[0:23:14] <ingman112> Do tell
[0:23:15] <+ThomasOfTroy> If it's still the UI issue, your reason sucks
[0:23:19] <Daxalog> Did you ever play Masters of Orion? Did they ever fix the new Masters of Orion game?
[0:23:29] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Pat did you see how Epic brought back the $2 Delorean DLC in Rocket League and it costs $10 now
[0:23:30] <%Sotetsu> Shame!
[0:23:35] <%AzureGale> wut
[0:23:35] <cureneckbeard> Play the 1996 classic Master of Orion II
[0:23:36] <killerqueensixx> shalom everyone
[0:23:36] <anAngryHamster> Stellaris is fucked up and the devs still don't seem to know what they want from it
[0:23:37] <+YaBish311> Just play CK3 with total conversion mods :3
[0:23:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OMG PAT LUL
[0:23:38] <sirtommygunn> damn
[0:23:39] <%Ne1son> Yeah Fuck you that's a terrible reason

[0:23:39] <Profmcstevie> Pat that was a mirror
[0:23:40] <viciousgrim> lol
[0:23:41] <%RustyCoyoteA> so a perfectly valid reason. Gotcha
[0:23:45] <AmkoTheTerrible> what the fuck
[0:23:47] <terrorengine> bummer
[0:23:49] <Wydamn> I thought he was going to talk about the way it advertises DLC in-game.

[0:23:54] <%SaiyanShoto> So the usual Pat way of judging a game off of the first 10 seconds? LUL
[0:23:54] <BliVru> check AoE 4
[0:23:55] <%crimsonharvest> they're not doing remotely the same thing but ok
[0:23:55] <+TestAnon> just mod in anime avatars like everyone else

[0:24:20] <$Zathas> Stellaris is one of my favourite games, so I don't quite get that.
[0:24:21] <+sonofthedeepsouth> GET FUCKED PDX
[0:24:23] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Stellaris is Paradox so the DLC is rough
[0:24:23] <MyNameIsRasus> #humblebrag
[0:24:24] <%Valdorick> Goddamn
[0:24:27] <+ThomasOfTroy> Aight, fair enough
[0:24:28] <+sonofthedeepsouth> REALEASE VICKY3
[0:24:28] <Wydamn> When you create your race, it tells you how your race would be better with these types of DLC and itemizes it for you
[0:24:29] <+mechslayer71> how complex is this compared to civ? never played one of these before
[0:24:29] <kazadaz> lmao
[0:24:32] <BliVru> Age of Empires 4 looks alright Im playing the Beta
[0:24:34] <%Ipsenscastle> Stellaris is rad
[0:24:35] <%Valdorick> The DLC is oof
[0:24:36] <irisluv333> fuck paradox's dlc shit
[0:24:37] <draca23> Oh god, I'm having flashbacks to my friend saying he wouldn't touch Kotor because, "It was ugly" DUDE, ITS AN OLD GAME, FUCK YOU.
[0:24:37] <GenericEric797> Stellaris is really fun in theory, but there are definitely flaws
[0:24:40] <%Sotetsu> Stellaris is my favorite 4X game.
[0:24:40] <%Wurmspawn> Guys not liking a UI is the same as the game not playing well, so not liking how a UI looks is just as valid as saying, this game doesn't play well.
[0:24:42] <%Ipsenscastle> and I hate 4X
[0:24:43] <hewwogames> stellaris is fun in theory
[0:24:44] <%ahomeschooldropout> Humankind is also available on the game pass
[0:24:48] <%crimsonharvest> stellaris is fine if you never play past midgame
[0:24:49] <sirtommygunn> i think some of their events straight up go "yeah this continues with the dlc, now nothing happens since you don't got it"
[0:24:50] <%BinaryFireball> pat streaming an RTS?????
[0:24:52] <not_twitter_rowan> @mechslayer71 seems to be complex in different ways tbh
[0:24:53] <%epide> yeah i gotta say that is the bad side of it but its a good one to play with friends
[0:24:55] <%TIME_PUNCHER> crusader kings 2 DLC still makes Sims look basic
[0:24:56] <%Agami23> man, i wish a good heroes of might and magic would come out
[0:24:59] <+Rinoka> @Wurmspawn it is subjective but it's also massively picky
[0:25:00] <$hattrick61> Also its real time
[0:25:03] <%TheGreatSkenardo> TheGreatSkenardo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months, currently on a 42 month streak! Several months of complete horseshit. Give more.
[0:25:07] <+ThomasOfTroy> Stellaris trickles in new DLC into the base version slowly, and lets players try out the DLCs in multiplayer if the host owns them
[0:25:18] <BliVru> Aoe 4 is more like a Base building game more
[0:25:19] <%Valdorick> UIs can modded to be nice, gameplay requires time, and sometimes is unsalvageable.
[0:25:20] <Profmcstevie> It's only the format of most of the gameplay in a 4X game
[0:25:23] <@SoFarFetched> cant wait until Pat does Age of Empires II multiplayer with friends Kappa
[0:25:25] <+Vigonept> Fuck stelaris ui, i need mods for that shit
[0:25:29] <+Stormiercashew> I completely agree
[0:25:29] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Did you watch Legends of the Guild yet?
[0:25:30] <%JoshManVGH> I like a 4x game. i really like 4x board games.
[0:25:33] <%Agami23> some people might not know what a 4ex game is in here
[0:25:39] <ELkasle> Stellaris has mods that improve UI
[0:25:39] <anAngryHamster> AI civs in Stellaris will never trade on equal terms so cooperation is impossible
[0:25:42] <%SpontaneousC> stellaris was GREAT until they made it micro as fuck, I do not care for how it has likr six different resources now. can't stand it anymore myself which bums me out because I like the rest of the game just not the management
[0:25:42] <ZorenMaximus> Fair
[0:25:44] <Profmcstevie> ALL I DO IS CIICK MENU, WHY NO DO GOOD MENU AND CLICk
[0:25:46] <sirtommygunn> make the spreadsheet look nice

[0:28:10] <MyNameIsRasus> pre stream
[0:28:11] <%TIME_PUNCHER> when you think about it, all controls are tank controls just with different sensitivity settings

[0:38:10] <%TIME_PUNCHER> FNAF fans are worse than Fortnite kiddies
[0:38:10] <%sandrews> Friday Night at Freddy's is correct
[0:38:11] <nip_nips> five freddies at night
[0:38:12] <+CitrusDrink> Friveday Nights Frunkin
[0:38:13] <%Bluwizard21> I'd play friday night at freddy's
[0:38:13] <%Valdorick> This is a small win for you, Pat, it means you don't know about it.
[0:38:13] <gustavozxd> friday night at freddies always makes me laugh

[0:38:20] <%RealThiele> WELCOME TO PRIME TIME, BITCH
[0:38:22] <%twistedj3ster> and Scott FUCKED IT UP
[0:38:24] <%Scevda> FNAF fandom is entirely comprised of cope
[0:38:24] <DomunDomunDomun> Five Night Fisticuffs
[0:38:26] <%Alazull> lol my message got ate by Pat yelling at Paige
[0:38:27] <gustavozxd> game theory
[0:38:28] <stantheman_97> still kinda is
[0:38:34] <%king_wragles> FNAF die hards are trying to say Pinhead is already under powered, but everyone who's played him say he's either perfect or ridiculously over powered
[0:38:35] <%bravebravesrobin> how'd you like rest of Forgotten City? Cheer500
[0:38:35] <%BoxNavy> cus your balls would be exposed for being bad @ game
[0:38:38] <kazadaz> It was streamer bait before the Streamer-Bait Industrial Complex got properly started up
[0:38:39] <%RyTYoung> You guys played one on the old channel did you not?
[0:38:39] <Clundy> Big ole sloppy mudpie of content
[0:38:41] <%Ipsenscastle> I'm so glad you didn't make me watch you play it
[0:38:44] <+dd44dostivei> sega cd shovelware
[0:38:44] <LorcaNomad> also scott is apparently a fuckhead?
[0:38:45] <gustavozxd> I used to watch the game theory lore videos
[0:38:45] <KaiserMario> Didn't you shitstorm it?
[0:38:47] <darkshotgunjoe> overused
[0:38:47] <bob900000> but the lore /s
[0:38:47] <maybefalco> its bait
[0:38:48] <Profmcstevie> I will not be scraping my brain cells against any more fnaf
[0:38:48] <SaltyAzteca> GIANT WORK
[0:38:51] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt well in the end you were right to avoid it
[0:38:54] <%pupil31> AHHHHHHH
[0:38:56] <%TIME_PUNCHER> FNAF feels like the Minecraft of horror
[0:38:56] <@PeachSaliva> I still haven't played it :(
[0:38:57] <BliVru> @patstaresat Friday Night Funkin and Five Nights at Freddys are too
[0:38:57] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I hate shock horror myself.
[0:38:57] <mrtanaka111> cynical pat
[0:38:58] <%crimsonharvest> dawn of the screaming at webcam era
[0:39:00] <Crabnator> start the game loser i got a zoom class to ignore
[0:39:00] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> I really don't understand why people are so obsessed about it
[0:39:01] <Profmcstevie> But who am le Purple guy
[0:39:01] <%SaiyanShoto> including his pants
[0:39:02] <+Romuken> Do shitstorm with geif
[0:39:02] <not_twitter_rowan> it seems like a franchise powered by both streamers getting jumpscared and Game Theory videos
[0:39:03] <%Valdorick> Do you remember how breads you've eaten?
[0:39:04] <KaiserMario> YOU STILL DO LUL
[0:39:04] <stantheman_97> hey i remember you and matt praising it during the shitstorm
[0:39:06] <%Agami23> anatomy is still the scariest game on the shitstorm
[0:39:07] <%Ipsenscastle> It's Night Trap but less interesting
[0:39:08] <%GabeSweetMan> But THAT'S JUST A THEORY! A GA-
[0:39:08] <%kingofasgard> it'd be the squeakiest stream you'd ever do
[0:39:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's barely a game.
[0:39:08] <iamnuff> Pat shitstormed some real fuckingtrash
[0:39:09] <+TestAnon> A Desolate Hope 2 when though
[0:39:09] <draca23> The only ones I liked is 1, the one with the sick kid and sister's location
[0:39:12] <%W1nterTitan> I think you called it a stress management sim
[0:39:12] <%Scevda> October shitstorm was better. I miss then
[0:39:13] <%sporeian94> There's a mexican FNAF live show and it's super weird with techno dance music and a MGS sneaking segement it's fucking weird and it got taken down on youtube
[0:39:15] <%SaiyanShoto> do you?
[0:39:17] <dekkitout> Spooky's House was great
[0:39:18] <BliVru> 2 diffefent games

[0:39:27] <@SoFarFetched> wow paige
[0:39:28] <LoneFonte> yep
[0:39:31] <%Valdorick> Damn, Peach gottem
[0:39:31] <%TIME_PUNCHER> I have never met an adult who regularly plays FNAF
[0:39:32] <%RetroCop87> NES horror games were LIT
[0:39:32] <iamnuff> You can make any genre of game that sucks if you don't give a fuck.
[0:39:32] <stantheman_97> jumpscareathon
[0:39:32] <nauticalgypsy> jump scares are easy
[0:39:33] <SaltyAzteca> The jankest horror games are the best comedy games
[0:39:33] <+Euphbugg> I mean, not wrong
[0:39:36] <@PeachSaliva> i could make a horror game
[0:39:36] <Profmcstevie> Ugly assets WORK for horror
[0:39:36] <gustavozxd> yeah
[0:39:38] <@ssjklyco> Is that why FNAF is popular and makes a lot of games?
[0:39:38] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Ture
[0:39:38] <@SoFarFetched> Its true look at what happened with the Medium
[0:39:39] <LorcaNomad> anatomy is amazing but bad too
[0:39:41] <%BoxNavy> AHHH!
[0:39:41] <%SaiyanShoto> but shitty horror games can be fun like a bad horror movie
[0:39:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> TUNGULUS
[0:39:45] <%Wurmspawn> Gottem Paige!
[0:39:45] <Vyneci> Don't forget the flashlight!
[0:39:47] <%sporeian94> ABANDONED IS SILENT HILLS! I WANT TO beLIEve
[0:39:47] <kazadaz> That's why I like horror movies, they're easy enough that weirdos can make them.  The more money goes into a movie the safer it plays things
[0:39:48] <%Ynkubus_> All the assest librarys just out there
[0:39:50] <@commanderclaw> Or a Platformer that's worse Super Meat Boy like that Hard Drive Article
[0:39:51] <%blistexthief> You spooked me

[0:39:53] <%kingofasgard> don't forget the shit flashlight
[0:39:54] <%BoxNavy> yea
[0:39:57] <gustavozxd> oh god that game was nuts
[0:39:57] <%GabeSweetMan> Anatomy is amazing.
[0:39:58] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt so like movies?
[0:39:58] <evbites> @ssjklyco that and lore
[0:39:58] <jetstreamlove_R> Scaring isn't easy
[0:39:59] <%InternetShis> Overkill also made Payday 2 which sucks
[0:40:01] <%PocketBearIllustrator> the last game that made he shiver with fear while playing was Silent Hill 3.
[0:40:02] <@SoFarFetched> Is paige STOMPING
[0:40:05] <@MistyMntns> I love Spooky's Horror house
[0:40:06] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt You say that but you got super jittery during those octobers
[0:40:06] <kazadaz> Yeah I go back and rewatch that one sometimes
[0:40:07] <@MistyMntns> Or whatever it is
[0:40:08] <not_twitter_rowan> Anatomy made me fucking shit myself
[0:40:12] <stantheman_97> horror is best when it's subtle or artistically brilliant
[0:40:12] <%Scevda> Agreed
[0:40:12] <%Valdorick> But you need your porn to be good to make a good porn game.
[0:40:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HA
[0:40:18] <%RyTYoung> :O
[0:40:21] <gustavozxd> atpCap she came here just to say that

[0:40:22] <Profmcstevie> then do
[0:40:24] <nip_nips> make a horror game based on living with pat
[0:40:27] <%BoxNavy> oh youre scary alright...
[0:40:28] <TheNegligibleOne> Horror is a great genre, all about fooling the player, its so nice to see open deception.
[0:40:28] <%Ne1son> Yeah
[0:40:29] <dekkitout> Spooky's was pretty gosh darn scarry
[0:40:29] <@SoFarFetched> PAIGE YOU SCARE US WHEN YOU EAT POISON
[0:40:29] <iosephe> do it
[0:40:29] <%rekinom> Parents flipped a breaker in my garage when they left a few weeks ago, didn't realize it until now. The freezer out there has been sitting without power that whole time. Worst smell I have ever smelled. :)

[0:41:59] <%TIME_PUNCHER> make Paige play a programming game. Like baba is you
[0:42:01] <Srthunda> paige is exactly the type of person pat was just talking about
[0:42:02] <%Valdorick> Kojima doesn't make games - he pays people to make games.
[0:42:02] <@SoFarFetched> Its more likely to hear paige "HOW DO I RIGHT CLICK!?"

[0:57:17] <+panlakes> tuning in... has Pat ever played a Civ-like game?
[0:57:28] <%TheHateFish> Fun fact: it's not illegal under Commonwealth law to chat shit about the Royal Family, as long as what you're saying wouldn't be illegal if you said it about anyone else under the street. Ergo, fuck the lot of 'em except Liz 2.

[1:03:53] <+KaguraRaion> @D00msDayDan Why?
[1:03:54] <LorcaNomad> LITERALLY 'GUT A FISH' IS SUCH A UNIVERALLY KNOWN PHRASE
[1:03:56] <TheAntiNihilist> THEN DONT FISH THERE
[1:03:58] <%moonmintparadise> those fish have aids
[1:03:59] <nip_nips> fish stink worse than pat
[1:04:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> Don't fish if you're not gonna keep
[1:04:02] <%Scevda> 6 eyes
[1:04:03] <%BoxNavy> nuh uh
[1:04:04] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt  We have radioactive residue and mercury in our big river
[1:04:05] <+RowenCleric> is like any water clean on earth now
[1:04:06] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Wrong it depends of cermics. Some ceramics are super conductors I actually studied that class for solar cell research
[1:04:06] <heartlesshealer> WHY THERE
[1:04:09] <%shadowace2400> FREE FOOD
[1:04:12] <%XzileGaming> fish cant handle rejection?
[1:04:14] <blue8moon> catch and release is common in a lot of places
[1:04:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> With a big hole in their mouth?
[1:04:15] <%ClericOfSparda> Everything likes surviving
[1:04:19] <%kingofasgard> maybe it's into that
[1:04:20] <%Anime_Flux> lmao
[1:04:20] <%epide> NO ITS THE CYCLE OF LIFE
[1:04:20] <Profmcstevie> I think they mean hooking fish for fun rather than food
[1:04:22] <LorcaNomad> LUL
[1:04:22] <%Order_of_Mystery> catch fish, scream at it, throw it back
[1:04:23] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[1:04:23] <stantheman_97> apparently catch and release has a very high mortality rate
[1:04:23] <%rekinom> But can fish swim?
[1:04:23] <MyNameIsRasus> LUL
[1:04:25] <+panlakes> ceramic can imprint the magnetism from the poles of the earth, i dont remember why but it's true
[1:04:25] <nip_nips> its a free piercing
[1:04:26] <LunarRemix> If the river's dirty they want to die
[1:04:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Fish dont feel pain jackass in Chat
[1:04:27] <+KaguraRaion> @KeiganOfAstora who cares its a fish lol
[1:04:28] <%RealThiele> Keigan hate sport fishing
[1:04:29] <Dunmarkh> Fish love vore

[1:15:58] <+KaguraRaion> @MiamiMemory I don't really know, the reason is like pat said but i still dont get it
[1:16:01] <%Sotetsu> Gypsy curse
[1:16:01] <%Monkeyweed21> goes down like saliva
[1:16:01] <JAGwab> can you bathe in thick water?
[1:16:02] <kazadaz> Heavy Water is h2o with two-neutron hydrogens, it's like 3% heavier than normal water
[1:16:03] <a_mad_dragon_> thin water?
[1:16:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> Maybe if they have a problem keeping it in their mouth?
[1:16:03] <%Dakuu75> (idk what this is)
[1:16:04] <%epide> prob becouse your swollow difernt
[1:16:05] <wannabemoogle> Just let it flow down your throat
[1:16:05] <@GeneralSCPatton> Water down that water
[1:16:06] <@ssjklyco> Salt is just dry water
[1:16:07] <%kingofasgard> take out the hydrogen
[1:16:07] <%maskofmichael> Wouldn't Thin Water just be Gas?
[1:16:08] <KnightOfTrousers> That turns it into Air and FLAMMABLE Air
[1:16:08] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt People with weak throat muscles have an easier time pushing it down
[1:16:08] <%rekinom> increasing the viscosity makes it easier to swallow
[1:16:13] <+RandyFistburgers> helps you keep it in your mouth
[1:16:15] <$Spydurman> so they don't choke
[1:16:16] <%RealThiele> its thick so maybe you les slikely to aspirate it?
[1:16:19] <heartlesshealer> distilled water?
[1:16:19] <%Treasure_Vault> is carbonated water thin?
[1:16:20] <MiamiMemory> At least it's not raw water
[1:16:22] <%SaiyanShoto> I didn't come here to get learned at
[1:16:22] <%Ipsenscastle> Hydrogen Oxide
[1:16:23] <%king_wragles> @JAGwab You can 'bathe' in anything technically
[1:16:24] <%TIME_PUNCHER> homeopathic water is the thickest with all the dicks in it
[1:16:38] <heartlesshealer> distilled water is the water you use for science lab
[1:16:39] <+glgzephyr> five, four, three....

[1:19:43] <ChokeOnMyChicken> @patstaresat why are you playing a 4x game? Are you even smart enough?
[1:19:45] <knight_verse> You can go and watch three episodes of an anime in the time it takes Pat to begin playing a game... with that said, go watch Fena Pirate Princess, the first two episodes are out.
[1:19:45] <deviljhojho_> i only watch ginger streamers with hours long intros tbh tomatoCool
[1:20:00] <%jtdobyns> I would not mind a 5 hour just chatting stream.
[1:20:04] <%RealThiele> breakthrough cases happen

[1:20:15] <+QuesoFM> LUL
[1:20:16] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> shrigma variant limesS
[1:20:16] <GenericEric797> Don't forgrt about the Ligma variant
[1:20:17] <artificiallynatural> the sugma strain
[1:20:17] <+Catpurnicus> no protection against Ligma Variant though
[1:20:17] <%SWFanatic> vaccinated positive infections are still less likely to be hospitalized
[1:20:17] <+TopTieramisu> don't even ask about the ligma variant
[1:20:17] <@GeneralSCPatton> And the Crimson Glaive Sigma variant
[1:20:18] <+D00msDayDan> and the ligma variant
[1:20:18] <tanarath> The ligma varient
[1:20:19] <stantheman_97> it's not 100% but better than 0%
[1:20:20] <heartlesshealer> yuuup, same reason I wear the mask from start to end when doing deliveries
[1:20:22] <harperstranger> First time watching Pat. Excited for this game as well lol
[1:20:23] <%Dakuu75> You need to get that 1.1 Patch for your immune system
[1:20:23] <%RealThiele> he said with a stright face
[1:20:24] <+farrellcityking> No it doesn‚Äôt
[1:20:24] <darkshotgunjoe> the more you know
[1:20:26] <KaiserMario> I'll live forever with a mask, gladly
[1:20:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'd like to kick Covid in the balls, plz
[1:20:28] <OldManDeckardCain> yeah, it makes your condition better. just like that guy that died while being vaccinated LUL
[1:20:30] <Profmcstevie> Tis the season of the unvaccinated, they gonna eat some serious shit
[1:20:31] <+glgzephyr> Oh yeah absolutely, I'm basically over the symptoms, and it never got worse than an average cold except for the loss of taste which still sucks
[1:20:32] <wannabemoogle> Yup. It's still transmittable
[1:20:37] <%JoshManVGH> Get the goddamn shot! (if you can)
[1:20:38] <+bugz_munny> There's like 10 variants
[1:20:39] <DianaTheAscian> wait repeat that
[1:20:41] <AngryAsian5> #GRINDSET

[1:20:44] <dekkitout> I found out theres also a lamda variant
[1:20:45] <LunarRemix> You should check out Cruelty Squad.
[1:20:45] <%bravebravesrobin> the asshole variant will kill us all
[1:20:46] <heartlesshealer> And if you get sick, the vaccination will lessen the severity of the symptoms
[1:20:47] <+bugz_munny> theres DELTA PLUS
[1:20:48] <%kingofasgard> you deserve a medal
[1:20:51] <+farrellcityking> So why get the vaccine if I can‚Äôt still get it?
[1:20:51] <+TheIndigoLlama> @artificiallynatural bro I'm dead LUL
[1:20:52] <bairros> you can still get infected, but it is virtually impossible to die from covid after vaccinated
[1:20:52] <%NCC1701Dave> I hate it, I stay inside
[1:20:52] <linSP> when you get the lambda variant and start wacking shit with a crowbar
[1:20:52] <kazadaz> Yes we all caught it, we're all sigmas

[1:20:54] <%baka_sugoi> G R I N D

[1:51:55] <Iniudan> @artificiallynatural But it is pretty limited until you either upgrade to a city or link it to a city (at which point you can start building stuff like it was it own city but it share ressource and building queue with city it is linked with)

[1:53:29] <ingman112> Hit-eyets
[1:53:29] <anAngryHamster> The biggest problem with Civ was having to focus on a single victory condition from the start
[1:53:31] <%justcallmebobplease> It's stupid how quickly Pat's presentation of Humankind has made me turn on Civ, despite all the hours I've sunk into it - these are all QoL things I'd also enjoy!

[2:06:22] <%NotMrDiddles> food or a monument to your greatness
[2:06:30] <Shwepie> @BliVru Probably closer to Endless Legends, but it also also kind of halfway between the two.
[2:06:34] <ingman112> Food in 3
[2:06:34] <+glgzephyr> NERV HQ?
[2:06:40] <ingman112> Then pyramid
[2:06:49] <BinaryBetrayer> It's Endless Legend but without the fantasy

[2:07:09] <slix3431> This farm is the TITS
[2:07:33] <%Sotetsu> Learning is for nerds
[2:07:41] <$hattrick61> In case some of you aren't joking, Memphis Tennessee was named after the Egyptian Memphis
[2:07:49] <JetpackMcQuack> horse OP
[2:07:52] <Iniudan> @BinaryBetrayer I think you mean the science fiction but with low tech population, thus think it is magic. =p
[2:07:55] <JetpackMcQuack> too many legs
[2:07:59] <kazadaz> @hattrick61 Damn i thought it was the other way around
[2:08:07] <%mighty_max_t> Just got here, how's the game been?
[2:08:11] <ZE_Count> woof
[2:08:12] <%Sotetsu> @hattrick61 The ancient Egyptians must be rolling in their tombs

[2:08:28] <penitentpendant> Huzzah
[2:08:34] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I think you have to click their portrait?
[2:08:35] <+MisterAvry> how's the BBQ in Memphis, Egypt?
[2:08:36] <kazadaz> You can use this to force migration between cities btw
[2:08:40] <LeotheHuntsman> bork
[2:08:43] <+glgzephyr> rad
[2:08:45] <BinaryBetrayer> @Iniudan Fantasy is all encopassing, science fiction is fantastic in genre category.
[2:08:49] <ZE_Count> Gief will defeat humankind.
[2:09:16] <slix3431> Pat Pots are essential to pyramid building
[2:09:20] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh i wanna do pottery
[2:09:30] <Shwepie> @Iniudan Whenever this kind of setting comes up I just end up missing pre-ubisoft Might & Magic games.
[2:09:31] <%Sotetsu> Is there a downside to over-expanding?
[2:09:32] <ZE_Count> Is there research?
[2:09:34] <MiamiMemory> ROUND 2
[2:09:39] <Parapattern> Those fucking peasants are going to work and earn ME money

[2:10:32] <+EdenOfLove> deary me
[2:10:32] <akitanito> you got skewered hard
[2:10:38] <+polothegreatest> does the music change acording to your CIV?
[2:10:38] <+RealMichaelPhelps> how long has pat been playing
[2:10:51] <Flyme14> how do outposts become cites?
[2:10:52] <akitanito> yet
[2:10:52] <BinaryBetrayer> What would a civilization of Pat minded people be like?
[2:10:52] <ZE_Count> The deer will remember that Pat.
[2:10:52] <%Sotetsu> Paige loves pearls
[2:10:56] <MrPandastic> Pat's just picking on the local wildlife and taking their lunch money.
[2:11:01] <%MushyCornbread> bah, just go take em
[2:11:03] <+glgzephyr> I bet you can harvest stuff off the coast
[2:11:06] <+DaliCussNuss> Likes like someone reskinned endless legend to be Civ
[2:11:12] <%Nobrev> @RealMichaelPhelps about 40 minutes
[2:11:13] <kazadaz> @BinaryBetrayer ...have you played alpha centauri?
[2:11:20] <dekkitout> You can't get shit off your own coastline? The hell?
[2:11:24] <Buttku> @binarybetrayer  fucked
[2:11:25] <AlphaRayAllen> I can't believe Civ didn't do delayed nukes
[2:11:36] <$lotharrio> Quick, murder them all!
[2:11:41] <+QuesoFM> @dalicussnuss same devs
[2:11:44] <$scallycap> mice-uh-NEE-yens
[2:11:56] <+r4ndom_villan> did he figure out linking outposts to citys yet?
[2:12:01] <BinaryBetrayer> @BinaryBetrayer @kazadaz University for life
[2:12:12] <+mrredwednesday> !uptime sbfpDattebayo
[2:12:12] <@Moobot> @mrredwednesday I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 12m.
[2:12:14] <Parapattern> Mice-uh-deez-nuts
[2:12:15] <anAngryHamster> Free drinky silver
[2:12:15] <$hattrick61> the proto-greeks
[2:12:19] <+DaliCussNuss> @QuesoFM ty. art style seems much different though, so I wouldnt have guessed.
[2:12:19] <+r4ndom_villan> hit the chain
[2:12:27] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Click on your main city, then click on an outpost
[2:12:32] <+r4ndom_villan> on your main city first
[2:12:38] <akitanito> why do you have to link manually?
[2:12:40] <kazadaz> Pat = Chairman Yang
[2:12:52] <+glgzephyr> it said penalty lmao
[2:12:54] <penitentpendant> Must Construct Additional Influence
[2:12:56] <@commanderclaw> Just piss on the territory and make it yours
[2:13:02] <$Futurecity10> Boosts your cities FIDSI
[2:13:02] <+r4ndom_villan> chaining is real important for making a super big city
[2:13:05] <kazadaz> Gomeisa's resources would get added to Memphis
[2:13:11] <+Rofiarf> you can only have so many cities, so you attach to increase that cities influence
[2:13:18] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Why is stability important?
[2:13:20] <+vaderxyz1970> I read that as attack
[2:13:22] <MiamiMemory> @kazadaz  Elmo = Chairmen Meow
[2:13:22] <%CatRidder> time to cheat
[2:13:23] <%Order_of_Mystery> E X P A N D  M E M P H I S
[2:13:25] <ingman112> Need more influence
[2:13:33] <BinaryBetrayer> If Pat is Yang does that make Paige Deidre?
[2:13:40] <penitentpendant> 7 inf per turn, with a 10 base. So in 3 turns it can be linked. Explore time~
[2:13:45] <%AFellowDegen> that doesn't seem worth it at al with all that loot in other place
[2:13:59] <%SWFanatic> There is no way to peace. It is the way.
[2:14:04] <Iniudan> @Rofiarf You can go over cap, but your influence start going down the drain if you over expand.
[2:14:09] <Parapattern> Spice
[2:14:11] <@commanderclaw> Saffron is a super expensive spice
[2:14:12] <akitanito> saffron is expensive spice
[2:14:12] <%XzileGaming> im just mad about saffron
[2:14:12] <Visorak6> very expensive spice
[2:14:13] <$lotharrio> Pretty sure it's a drug
[2:14:14] <JetpackMcQuack> fancy bush
[2:14:14] <Mattais88> Most expesive spice in the world
[2:14:16] <$scallycap> saffron is a spice pat
[2:14:18] <AlphaRayAllen> Expensive plants
[2:14:24] <%Nobrev> very expensive spice
[2:14:28] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Spice
[2:14:29] <AlphaRayAllen> Both
[2:14:31] <@commanderclaw> It's both
[2:14:32] <Mattais88> Also that
[2:14:34] <Visorak6> It is a color
[2:14:34] <NatusSalis> Patron?
[2:14:36] <%Nobrev> the color comes from the spice
[2:14:36] <+glgzephyr> it's what the color is named after
[2:14:37] <linSP> saffron is delicious plant sperm
[2:14:37] <penitentpendant> When it's so expensive, it's both
[2:14:37] <akitanito> you can make yellow color out of it as well
[2:14:38] <BinaryBetrayer> I thought it was a pokemon city
[2:14:40] <slix3431> It can be turned into dye
[2:14:40] <$scallycap> i mean, the color is what the color of saffron is
[2:14:41] <%Puhff> Both
[2:14:43] <+archangellus00> Is this a civilization style game Im assuming?
[2:14:46] <KnightOfTrousers> One of the most valuable substances on Earth by weight
[2:14:46] <Iniudan> Saffron is worth more then gold by weight.
[2:14:54] <%Wulfphelz> It's just like a orange
[2:14:55] <%Monkeyweed21> lots of colors are named after things, like Salmon Pink
[2:14:56] <kazadaz> It's a strat resource of some kind, yeah
[2:14:57] <%Sotetsu> The mystery resource could be anything! It could even be a boat!
[2:15:00] <%Puhff> Saffron is also extremely powerful as a spice
[2:15:00] <+RealMichaelPhelps> dominate the great lake
[2:15:06] <$AmkoTheTerrible> Saffron is one of the most valuable spices of all time
[2:15:14] <$AmkoTheTerrible> and you know how history loves spices
[2:15:16] <linSP> what color is orange
[2:15:25] <ingman112> So it‚Äôs putting an outpost in the preset region that claims it
[2:15:26] <kazadaz> Just leave, it won't attack you
[2:15:26] <Iniudan> You don't heal outside of your territory once you no longer nomad
[2:15:27] <$scallycap> kill it
[2:15:28] <akitanito> woolie's counterattack

[2:17:13] <%Wurmspawn> Glad to know that magic pixel doesn't auto mean that the unit is still lost even though the game shows you didn't "lose" the unit in combat.
[2:17:30] <Shwepie> @Ranryu692 Very sad.
[2:17:31] <+jojo_7767> A natural wonder?
[2:17:37] <kulmoth> @QuesoFM well that explains it haha
[2:17:40] <%AFellowDegen> @kulmoth Same dev. but most hex 4x games now a days have that combat
[2:17:53] <KnightOfTrousers> Damn this map is fuckin' vibrant
[2:17:55] <%whyskeywolfe> ????
[2:17:55] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat You have the influnce to claim that terrority and you can then heal
[2:18:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> now teach the horsies to fight with swords
[2:18:00] <%RonaldMcDownload> Gundam Mulu is my favorite series
[2:18:03] <kazadaz> You get fame for finding natty wonders; someone else did that
[2:18:04] <%Sotetsu> No wonder
[2:18:07] <dekkitout> Horse tourist market is a real boon
[2:18:16] <akitanito> just steal that wonder
[2:18:25] <medoodoo> This music makes me think of Pat riding a camel for some reason
[2:18:29] <%The_Death_Owl> is this like civ but better or just different?
[2:18:29] <%laserbeaming> you feel human already?
[2:18:47] <Visorak6> This game doesnt use FIDSI like the other games?
[2:18:58] <Visorak6> It seems to
[2:18:59] <%The_Death_Owl> @medoodoo  I feel like Pat would hate camels for some reason thesph1MistyJoy
[2:19:09] <%Monkeyweed21> @Visorak6 it does but its money instead of dust
[2:19:11] <MiamiMemory> @PatStaresAt    I wonder if the soundtrack systole changes depending on the culture you choose.
[2:19:12] <kazadaz> It uses a brand-new system called FIMSI
[2:19:18] <AlphaRayAllen> They have long eyelashes
[2:19:19] <medoodoo> @The_Death_Owl LOLOLOL that poor camel
[2:19:20] <penitentpendant> @The_Death_Owl Perhaps the fear of them spitting in his hair?
[2:19:21] <Visorak6> Ah right
[2:19:26] <kayamek> @MiamiMemory
[2:19:29] <kayamek> It does
[2:19:31] <+MisterAvry> Memphis and the Plateau of Horses

[2:26:22] <$scallycap> how did you build a pyramid before inventing the wheel?
[2:26:22] <MiamiMemory> @GarbageQueenEllie  Big ASSSSETS
[2:26:24] <penitentpendant> What's in the bottom left corner?
[2:26:25] <evbites> @penitentpendant it's heavily damages morale
[2:26:28] <@commanderclaw> Science first for faster research probably
[2:26:29] <SaltyAzteca> Is it gonna take plagues and a soundtrack made by Hans Zimmer to be relevant again Kappa
[2:26:32] <%laserbeaming> INDUSTRY IS KING
[2:26:34] <kazadaz> Lumberyard = more production
[2:26:40] <%TheLemuroid> Growth
[2:26:43] <BinaryBetrayer> Science to get shit faster
[2:26:47] <penitentpendant> @evbites But it increases population growth
[2:26:52] <akitanito> you aren't even close to anyone
[2:26:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> @MiamiMemory But I don't want to do research. I'd rather just.... SING!
[2:26:58] <BinaryBetrayer> Industry then
[2:27:01] <%DovaDude29> Wait, so this game‚Äôs like the Civilization games or something?
[2:27:02] <%watts121> Science is for nerds.
[2:27:08] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat What is that about that Forced Labour

[2:27:33] <$scallycap> you havent invented wheels, masonry, or a calendar, and yet you have a pyramid
[2:27:33] <penitentpendant> Found a lot of Square blocks and just dragged them over
[2:27:33] <%watts121> who needs masonry when you have SLAVERY
[2:27:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> (spreads hands) ALIENS

[2:28:43] <penitentpendant> Oh no, I'm gonna have to load up Civ again. There goes 40 hours.
[2:28:44] <%Mister_McDerp> horse girls are sent to the horse mines
[2:28:53] <dekkitout> Horses can through with their clutch understanding of ore prospecting
[2:28:56] <$scallycap> brb gotta puke
[2:29:01] <%IamGrapes> is this just a better Civ?
[2:29:04] <akitanito> you could always shift one of the money guys onto science
[2:29:09] <+MisterAvry> you'll be working those horse mines til you forget what the sun looks like!
[2:29:09] <+Jakeofalco> so how is this different from civ?
[2:29:10] <$scallycap> Kawaii Ijen

[2:30:16] <jumpyhugs> @AmkoTheTerrible LUL
[2:30:18] <penitentpendant> @Jakeofalco Combat's different, you can move pre-cities to better spots so you can exploit material properly in case you make mistakes, armies can grow in the field

[2:37:10] <@Ranryu692> Jobs need people?
[2:37:10] <KnightOfTrousers> Oh my god I just noticed the game uses FIDSI,
[2:37:11] <BinaryBetrayer> GREEN UNITS ARE MADE OUT OF PEOPLE
[2:37:16] <KnightOfTrousers> I knew this was by the same people as Endless!
[2:37:18] <%Sotetsu> You need to unlock robots, I guess
[2:37:25] <%flying_hipp0> FIDSI is important but so are people
[2:37:28] <%The_Death_Owl> what's FIDSI?
[2:37:35] <dekkitout> By the strait?
[2:37:35] <BinaryBetrayer> Figsi if it's gold instead of dust
[2:37:39] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt I like that, makes it so early game miltary aggression isn't as free
[2:37:40] <%whyskeywolfe> BIG NUMBAH
[2:37:41] <+MisterAvry> that 5 13 looks good
[2:37:48] <ingman112> Stability might be rough if it‚Äôs too far

[2:45:48] <XoftheTITANS> OUR farms
[2:45:51] <kazadaz> Memphis Tennessee is called that because the early USians were classics nerds, and named a bunch of towns along the Mississippi after towns on the Nile
[2:45:59] <M0untain_wolf> Hivemind
[2:46:01] <@commanderclaw> Pat cannot resist the siren call of communism, even in the Ancient era
[2:46:13] <%HotSauceFiend> The egyptian city of memphis?
[2:46:16] <kazadaz> there's a cairo in Georgia (pronounced Kay-ro)
[2:46:18] <%SveriSageAdvice> no you can attach it, you just cantt make it into a city

[2:47:14] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh sick and your area increased
[2:47:16] <$AmkoTheTerrible> Can you rename cities?
[2:47:20] <kazadaz> I think (but am not sure) that there's a temporary penalty to city-making costs for a couple turns after you claim a territory
[2:47:22] <%SuckerPunchSyd> So now you have that whole sea
[2:47:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if i've never played a civ game is this a good one to try?

[2:49:17] <%HotSauceFiend> DIVINE PAT vs Natural PAt
[2:49:18] <%CatastropheCorvid> Question: Are there Norse or Scotland to play as?
[2:49:19] <MasterTonberry23> oh, i was thinking because this is out of your usual wheelhouse mr boivin
[2:49:19] <ManfredA> I mean those are the two main forms of thought in that era
[2:49:21] <@commanderclaw> I mean, it's the Ancient era, not a whole lot of humanism back then
[2:49:23] <kazadaz> Ah they nerfed it, Natural Right used to be really OP in terms of influence
[2:49:24] <%Alazull> I mean, no one actually has a right to rule, right?
[2:49:26] <akitanito> I think light bulb better
[2:49:31] <+geekjacob> you are Egypt pat
[2:49:43] <kazadaz> @CatastropheCorvid Norse yes, Scots no

[2:50:38] <%BinaryFireball> Diviiiine
[2:50:40] <@GeneralSCPatton> Natural Right sounds like it might lead into some kind of Exemplary Humanism

[2:51:52] <akitanito> but you do like attaching outposts
[2:51:57] <SilverFaustX> like civ
[2:51:57] <%RealThiele> Horus?!?!? TRAITOR

[2:52:15] <%HotSauceFiend> Max min your religion
[2:52:16] <+MisterAvry> remember not to take your real life ideology from early game Civ games
[2:52:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> Consume
[2:52:20] <+JupiterDjin> You want to make big cities though that link drop is nice
[2:52:21] <+Stormiercashew> moralism les go
[2:52:21] <snivins> full fanatism LUL
[2:52:29] <XoftheTITANS> OUR Outpost
[2:52:34] <sirrice77> if disco elysium has taught me anything its that being centrist is evil, unless you're kim
[2:52:44] <%HotSauceFiend> IS that the shadow of a sea beast?
[2:52:47] <+geekjacob> our out post comrade
[2:52:53] <%RealThiele> the emperor provides
[2:52:53] <Crabnator> kim is the only cool centrist
[2:53:02] <kazadaz> There will be more
[2:53:06] <%laserbeaming> that's a Mammoth
[2:53:08] <penitentpendant> The Mammoth returns, looking for his 20 bucks
[2:53:09] <ingman112> One more we can attacj
[2:53:22] <kazadaz> Distance is too great
[2:53:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what progresses eras in this game? time, or some action
[2:53:28] <%Monkeyweed21> time to build a new city
[2:53:28] <penitentpendant> It's cheaper to turn it into a new city now
[2:53:38] <%Anime_Flux> God Emperor Pat. Long may he reign.
[2:53:43] <+geekjacob> can we save the mammoths or are they destoned too die out?
[2:53:58] <%HotSauceFiend> I still remember playing as Vienna in Civ and loving it
[2:54:17] <%topendbuzza> SALT
[2:54:27] <%captain_kirkhammer> This is Humanity? Didn't Pat say CK3 was too much for him? Was that a presentation thing?
[2:54:31] <dekkitout> Salt mines are open
[2:54:35] <ingman112> Costs influence
[2:54:38] <alrobot2014> @cobalt_phoenix_ iirc eras change based on you accomplishing some objectives
[2:54:43] <+geekjacob> aight
[2:54:43] <+Brizzo24> @HotSauceFiend is that the money empire caus ei also love that shit
[2:54:44] <kayamek> @cobalt_phoenix_ You need to get era stars on the top left. You get them by getting more people or researching science etc
[2:54:45] <akitanito> build the pee mines
[2:54:46] <+mechslayer71> @captain_kirkhammer humankind
[2:54:47] <+glgzephyr> that was straight up the main motif of Journey right there
[2:54:54] <%echobee_tv> psaJpeg
[2:55:00] <%JoshManVGH> His bladder texted him!
[2:55:04] <%IamGrapes> "bathroom"
[2:55:05] <+ComradeCoyote> forgottenJerry forgottenJerry forgottenJerry
[2:55:07] <BinaryBetrayer> I'd be palying it right now if I could afford it, honestly. I really like the studio behind this game.
[2:55:07] <%HotSauceFiend> @Brizzo24 i may have gotten the name wrong, but you got the right civ in mind
[2:55:16] <%RealThiele> paige broke her setup again?
[2:55:25] <+mechslayer71> @captain_kirkhammer he did mention that UI means a lot to him since the game is mostly menus
[2:55:27] <+MisterAvry> is that drink next to Gief new?
[2:55:30] <owazowski> Diaper check time
[2:55:33] <+Brizzo24> @HotSauceFiend its escaping me too but man i would fucking rule EVERYTHING WITH MONEY
[2:55:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @alrobot2014 thanks
[2:55:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @kayamek ty
[2:55:45] <+Brizzo24> NEED ARMIES? BOOM BOUGHT
[2:55:53] <%captain_kirkhammer> @mechslayer71 That makes sense, CK3's UI friggin' sucks, he would have done well to start with CK2
[2:56:24] <ManfredA> crusader kings looks really complex at a glance but in truth it's quite simple
[2:56:25] <zerointelligence000> I swear I think I buy every game Pat plays since this stream has sold me on this so hard... I don;t even play civ
[2:56:47] <Crabnator> @ManfredA yeah just fuck everyone's wives and youre good
[2:56:54] <%captain_kirkhammer> @ManfredA cuck pope, get money
[2:57:00] <PartyFavors> I do play Civ and this looks really promising
[2:57:24] <ManfredA> People can't wipe out your bloodline if everyone's bloodline is your bloodline
[2:57:37] <+TestAnon> this is a whole lot better than civ 6 at launch but I still think it needs at least 1 good expansion to be truly great
[2:57:48] <dekkitout> @ManfredA Worked for the Hapsfords
[2:58:02] <+garbagegenesis> @TestAnon as is tradition
[2:58:12] <ManfredA> Amplitude makes good 4X games
[2:58:15] <kazadaz> hapsford omg
[2:58:17] <ManfredA> I'm a big fan of Endless Space 2
[2:58:40] <+aWanderingKaivo> @ManfredA habsburgs LUL
[2:59:00] <ManfredA> they had to nerf the habsburg strat in CK because it was too strong
[2:59:05] <+bugz_munny> So whats the consensus so far on this game?
[2:59:10] <%captain_kirkhammer> Henry Ford was a secret Hapsburg lovechild
[2:59:19] <%RealThiele> its definitely a 4x
[2:59:35] <+bugz_munny> Looks like it lol
[2:59:52] <+aWanderingKaivo> just popped in, was looking into this game a bit earlier this year
[2:59:54] <Crabnator> looks like civ!‚Ñ¢
[2:59:58] <ManfredA> Games like this tend to live and die on their mid and late game so it's too early to call
[3:00:00] <Dinflame> Wonder why they decided to like exactly copy the civ 6 aesthetic
[3:00:03] <+bugz_munny> I played a lot of Civ 5 but HATED 6, was hoping for a 5 replacement
[3:00:17] <+TestAnon> a lot of reviewers said too much civ, not enough endless legend
[3:00:50] <%Romuken> bork
[3:00:58] <%topendbuzza> OH NO
[3:01:11] <ManfredA> you were cutting off Osiris's junk
[3:01:16] <%IamGrapes> "wrestle" with "the dog"
[3:01:21] <+Rofiarf> yeah
[3:01:22] <+r4ndom_villan> it should
[3:01:22] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:01:22] <+aWanderingKaivo> oh boy those resource icons sure look familiar lol
[3:01:27] <kayamek> It keeps
[3:01:30] <+JupiterDjin> You'd have to assume so
[3:01:32] <%Sigma_190_Beta> Yeah it should.
[3:01:41] <+Rofiarf> cause there is no luxury goods around it
[3:01:49] <+r4ndom_villan> artisans are only on exploitable resources
[3:01:57] <%topendbuzza> SALT
[3:02:17] <ManfredA> yes
[3:02:17] <penitentpendant> Need more salt, time to find a League of Legends forum
[3:02:27] <%Sigma_190_Beta> Yeah, Horses should be.
[3:02:32] <+r4ndom_villan> techs gate which resources you can exploit
[3:02:39] <+JupiterDjin> Horses eating all the collectables
[3:03:04] <ManfredA> makes sense
[3:03:10] <ManfredA> Endless is a wide game typically
[3:03:15] <Meltgar> So is this game like Civilization?
[3:03:20] <+EdenOfLove> Peach is live
[3:03:20] <%TheWinged7> well, bye pat time to go watch peach sipsipHellmo
[3:03:24] <Garry_Guyface> The UI sounds EXACTALLY like the one from Endless Legends
[3:03:26] <Meltgar> Or completely different mechanics?
[3:03:32] <+KnightHart00> The way it draws borders I dont fully understand yet. Sometimes I can even found outposts/cities literally next to my first city
[3:03:39] <penitentpendant> From a tutorial point of view, having an AI civ nearby can cause havoc to player curve
[3:03:44] <fIashman92> You might be on your own continent
[3:03:45] <ManfredA> it's Civ made by the Endless series guys
[3:03:57] <ChokeOnMyChicken> @meltgar more like endless legend
[3:03:59] <penitentpendant> So I can understand the Tutorial keeping you on your own continent
[3:04:02] <+r4ndom_villan> in higher difficulty its harder to go wide with outposts since you need to build defense to protect them
[3:04:05] <NewWillinium> I have heard that the maps in this game are much smaller then in Endless Legends or in Civ.   But perhaps that has changed now that the game is out of early access
[3:04:06] <kazadaz> How many other players exist?
[3:04:08] <Dunmarkh> look at this geocentric flat earther thinking he's seen the whole world
[3:04:12] <Meltgar> SeemsGood Thx for info chat
[3:04:26] <+aWanderingKaivo> hey look its Pat
[3:04:33] <dekkitout> Pray to god of science
[3:04:48] <$AmkoTheTerrible> I hope there is a way to make the maps bigger I want Civ 4 scale gigantic maps
[3:05:01] <Meltgar> become an ORK PAT, the harder you thing the easier it becomes real
[3:05:04] <Meltgar> *think
[3:05:06] <+MisterAvry> 12 pop sounds easy enough
[3:05:08] <kazadaz> Max map size is 150x88
[3:05:22] <%Sigma_190_Beta> 12 Pop is kind of easy.
[3:05:31] <penitentpendant> @Meltgar Ork Motivation Speakers, Strongest Unit in the World
[3:05:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> Firemen?

[3:20:56] <FrostedZaibatsu> The black egyptians were fan fiction. Thats what America says
[3:20:59] <cooldude69xx> Does that make Wakanda Expanded Universe content?

[3:24:14] <MiamiMemory> In a couple hundred turns, sea level rise will eventually consume the pyramid
[3:24:17] <terrorengine> that looks like a river
[3:24:18] <TheAntiNihilist> ResidentSleeper

[3:26:45] <illTemperedSeaBass> "But my Queen, the peasants have no cake to eat!" | "Then let them eat bread."

[3:35:16] <+aWanderingKaivo> I don't think I could play this, I was hoping it wasn't going to be like Civ where it copy pastes real historical names in random places where it makes no sense
[3:35:23] <kazadaz> Important thing, YOU DON'T LOSE THE HORSES when they buy them
[3:35:33] <@Ranryu692> the music cut out suddenly while I wasn't looking at the screen and I thought something had gone wrong and the game had "crashed"

[3:35:45] <%RonaldMcDownload> @aWanderingKaivo you can rename shit
[3:35:46] <kazadaz> The free market makes new horses somehow
[3:35:53] <$AmkoTheTerrible> they take the horse skimmings
[3:35:55] <Zombrocom> Bonus Ducks
[3:35:56] <ManfredA> presumably it's because they're trading you the horses still
[3:36:04] <ChokeOnMyChicken> @awanderingkaivo have you never played a historical 4x game besides civ lmaooo

[3:37:26] <@SpaceCapnCrone> the tutorial is like that
[3:37:27] <kayamek> Maybe the map is too big?
[3:37:57] <@SpaceCapnCrone> all the victory states are turned off, as well
[3:37:59] <kazadaz> Only 1 direction to explore in so you don't get lost
[3:38:03] <+KnightHart00> The AI is really aggressive on outpost and city settling so like... Civ basically
[3:38:04] <+ghostfaceninja_> how many turns is the tutorial?
[3:38:11] <kazadaz> I'm thinking of ending turns
[3:38:16] <+titansloth93> Just one... more... turn...
[3:38:23] <williamrooster> when about do boarders clash normally?

[3:42:07] <SomeAsianDood> The true civ experience isn't complete with out game crashes
[3:42:07] <ChungusQuest> I hope the next new religion is NoSignalism
[3:42:08] <dashmatt> pat won
[3:42:10] <kazadaz> i was right about harvesting resources dammit
[3:42:10] <%pokefan9956> I genuinely forgot Paige was streaming
[3:42:15] <%RealThiele> some weird DbD streamer i bet
[3:42:18] <%Scevda> Your mistress? /s
[3:42:36] <Ralfclogs> raid peach???
[3:42:43] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Character Action Elk
[3:42:47] <DracaenaLeaf> LUL
[3:42:47] <%HaroldDonchee> that deer would have songs about it
[3:42:48] <%depressed_skeleton> Strong elk
[3:42:53] <SaltyAzteca> LOOK AT THE BONES
[3:43:00] <%whyskeywolfe> The elk killed 6 of you and you only lose 10% fighting strength?
[3:43:05] <%Monkeyweed21> but then you use the elk meat to make 10 more huys
[3:43:05] <SomeAsianDood> That elk royal released us and wiped us out man
[3:43:10] <%RealThiele> LESS MOUTHS TO FEED ITS A WINWIN
[3:43:11] <%wizkid50000> Thank you!
[3:43:15] <williamrooster> prehistoric elk may have been really big
[3:43:36] <terrorengine> remember when they hunted buffalos by just running entire heards off of cliffs?
[3:43:38] <%Monkeyweed21> Endless Legend has some really fantastic factions and artwork
[3:44:00] <+xerotwo> doodBait
[3:44:09] <%Caped_Eggy> Yea, that sucks
[3:44:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Endless Legend has incredibly unique factions if you can fix the UI scaling
[3:44:35] <%Scevda> I wish you could fully make your own.
[3:44:49] <williamrooster> custom factions always made more sense
[3:44:54] <tanarath> Ugh, that sucks
[3:44:57] <%depressed_skeleton> Soon it shall be MY birthday. I am growing stronger
[3:44:58] <MasterTonberry23> Isnt US the worst is Civ? Every Civ?
[3:44:59] <illTemperedSeaBass> Civs also have different start biases. US starts on rivers, which is straight-up the best spawn in the game. It's also irrelevant if you're not a try-hard.
[3:45:12] <KnightOfTrousers> Yo Endless Space 2 Rocks, the custom factions have lots of options
[3:45:14] <+xerotwo> LUL
[3:45:15] <%Monkeyweed21> yea but the final DLC of Endless Space 2 is almost game ruiningly bad
[3:45:24] <%NopeBadguy> No. No. Yes.
[3:45:27] <%depressed_skeleton> help
[3:45:43] <+Havictos> @Monkeyweed21 That's why it's not included in sales of the game
[3:45:44] <%captain_kirkhammer> how so?
[3:45:46] <illTemperedSeaBass> @MasterTonberry23 Definitely not. America averages around the middle of most tier lists.
[3:45:48] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Have you played more GAA or MHS2 since you stopped streaming them?
[3:45:51] <%Scevda> @monkeyweed21 ya i heard about that train wreck
[3:45:51] <KnightOfTrousers> Is that the hacking DLC?
[3:45:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yeye
[3:45:55] <Gorshum> Cya

[3:46:13] <%YakumoYomi> Peace out, Patty Cakes
[3:46:14] <%Monkeyweed21> It sucks because the new faction they added is great @Scevda
