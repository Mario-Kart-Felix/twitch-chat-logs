[0:09:26] <%crimsonharvest> so diablo is a rogue, and hades is like a 6th generation rogue
[0:09:28] <%42nfl19> Is this a rogue lite/like?
[0:09:28] <worldbrand> hack n slash has been gone for so long we've forgotten huh

[0:12:00] <%Shadicara> Not a bad thing though
[0:12:02] <%redrins> honestly, gauntlet
[0:12:03] <@SSaryn> More of a Mayan influenced Dabablo and Hades
[0:12:06] <%SirGO0SE> in a world where blizzard is dead we need more diablos
[0:12:07] <$RealThiele> gauntlet agreed
[0:12:12] <%the_mental_punk> what does your stand do in this game?
[0:12:13] <+MoonObscure> hades 2 :O
[0:12:17] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> ...I do like Diablo...so. Hrm.

[0:12:27] <zafooru> Combo?
[0:12:28] <%rytyoung> Dabablo is a good naem
[0:12:29] <IminyourBase> i think it's just a combo multiplier
[0:12:29] <+ArcLifth> keeping up the combo on the right
[0:12:29] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL eat shit
[0:12:29] <usurper_sos> Combo

[0:12:30] <%SvenHolgersson> I think its just a kill that gives you money
[0:12:31] <cheezbass> is there an ending like diablo or endless waves. sorry if its too early to ask that

[0:12:41] <%Jekado> greed kill looks like a kill meter that cools down

[0:13:17] <%Shadicara> Brutal
[0:13:18] <drinkmoxie> Greed kill looks like multiple kills in a row without taking damage

[0:51:15] <%MoulesFritz> this looks like Hades but less interesting
[0:51:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> DIPPIN' DOTS
[0:51:21] <Drusain> dots are just temp extra damage
[0:51:23] <+shocknawful> now i want dippin dots, thanks Pat
[0:51:36] <%Rumbutt> I want a DOTOT: a (Damage Over Time) Over Time, that will put a DOT on an enemy with every tick, becoming an exponential damage nightmare
[0:51:38] <%Frost_Quill> I can't type out the .hack game's full name without it counting as a command lol.
[0:51:41] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt That would have been great to know 10-20 minutes ago
[0:51:47] <%SirGO0SE> if dippin dots were the ice cream of the future, why arent all ice creams dippin dots now
[0:51:58] <Xelhesia> yup
[0:52:03] <mostundesired> Must be the DOTs
[0:52:03] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> wee bit
[0:52:03] <+griffball13> because big curse
[0:52:04] <IminyourBase> maybe more curse means more arm light?
[0:52:04] <@commanderclaw> Don't worry about it
[0:52:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> @rumbutt Sounds like something from an incremental game
[0:52:05] <%Meekest> Its probably fine
[0:52:06] <%crimsonharvest> ARMS GO UP
[0:52:07] <koffeemancer> Thats the fury buff @PatStaresAt

[0:52:10] <usurper_sos> The more curse, the more glow
[0:52:10] <%SirGO0SE> MORE DOTS
[0:52:10] <%Alpha8087> When you take damage your passive bonus is triggering
[0:52:13] <%xeros720> probably glowing from all the temp buffs you're getting
[0:52:14] <dan_g_v> must be greed curse
[0:52:15] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Don't worry it's just the biocurse
[0:52:16] <SpaceCatStation> arms getting pumped up with huge curse energy
[0:52:27] <%42nfl19> you need more curse juice
[0:52:36] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> healers
[0:52:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sirgo0se Because we actually live in the dead past, and the real present is 500 years from now.
[0:52:51] <dan_g_v> quick, grab your bone hurting juice, Pat. It surely is cursed!
[0:52:56] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt That you can save when you first enter a new area
[0:53:04] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt But why later damage when you can do big damage now?
[0:53:08] <%SirGO0SE> @GeneralSCPatton all my friends are dead? :(
[0:53:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> In Canada they don't call Dippin Dots Dippin Dots. They're called Ice Cream Mini Melts

[0:54:33] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> only they can do that, I think.
[0:54:34] <%Laecerelius> seems like the fireball statues blow each other up
[0:54:37] <%Jekado> the fireball stations can destroy themselves tho
[0:54:38] <@Moobot> Hey, check out Curse of the Dead Gods! It's cool! Use this link! bit.ly/2Ry5IeB

[1:36:56] <MajoraZ> Actual, non ironic fact about Aztec technology to tie into the meming from earlier: They DID have formal taxonomy, centuries ahead of Europe: They had experimental bonotanical gardens where plants were crossbred and tested for medical properties and then categorized using what was essentially 18th century, Linnaean binominal systems.
[1:36:58] <T_Sasquatch> sweaty try hard
[1:37:00] <%corepercentlives> plot twist pat paid to get paid to avoid re6
[1:37:03] <%Valdorick> Oh no, Pat is sweaty! He's getting the skill based Fortnite games!
[1:37:05] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> That's just the MPreg setting in, don't worry
[1:37:06] <%shocknawful> M O I S T
[1:37:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat is covered in Gamer Goo
[1:37:07] <%moogleboy1984> Pat Shills At... strong visuals Darkest Diablo

[1:37:37] <%moogleboy1984> real shit though, this game looks sick as hell
[1:37:39] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> go back Pat I think you blew something up
[1:37:41] <$arcielardor> @patstaresat what role do you play in Deep Rock Galactic?
[1:37:46] <s1rcuit> now all I can think about is Pat's Rent review and shitty the people in it were
[1:37:56] <DartonLance> how much would it cost to get the podcast sponsored by pats ball water
[1:38:01] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> oooh, I can't wait to see you play that
[1:38:09] <%D00msDayDan> gunner's great
[1:38:11] <%Jekado> are you playing deep rock solo for the stream?
[1:38:11] <vexicbayn> okay how long until Pat shills for raid shadow legends
[1:38:24] <$notEisiger> Driller is the shit, claim him
[1:38:25] <T_Sasquatch> im shocked pat hasnt been asked for raid
[1:38:26] <%Chichen> @vexicbayn whenever they pay him
[1:38:31] <T_Sasquatch> they will take anyone
[1:38:37] <dukenux> So what exactly is this game? Looks a bit like Torchlight.
[1:38:41] <mobiusnightshade> @vexicbayn Not how long. How much do they have to pay him? XD
[1:38:46] <yourliteraldog> Can you get a bang bros sponsorship?
[1:38:52] <%Jekado> stream raid shadow legends?

[1:38:55] <vexicbayn> I LITERALLY just got a shadow legends ad
[1:38:56] <%Jekado> that would be weird
[1:38:57] <T_Sasquatch> at this point everyone knows about the game
[1:38:57] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> bet you're gonna wish you picked the Haven path, huh?
[1:38:59] <mostundesired> Weird, considering how it's the most AMBITIOUS MOBILE RPG
[1:39:03] <vexicbayn> that's why I even mentioned it
[1:39:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Probably cause they know folks would play ten minutes of it and find out it's bullshit
[1:39:06] <Dragon_Batman> I'm pretty shure they do
[1:39:06] <%shocknawful> he didnt say he wouldnt take it...

[1:42:25] <yourliteraldog> makes your dick bigger
[1:42:27] <mobiusnightshade> You'd only heal the 4% if an enemy died from the environment.
[1:42:33] <vexicbayn> dexchamps rise up

[1:42:48] <mostundesired> You right
[1:42:50] <%Jekado> Fort is health, Dex is damage, luck is gold
[1:43:15] <mobiusnightshade> Poor Pat got all the knick-knacks, but none of the paddy-whacks.
[1:43:28] <Djinnazz> Is this a Rogue-like/light?
[1:43:29] <vexicbayn> Dex is the only good stat in RPGs do not discuss
[1:43:42] <Monkeyweed21> Would you reccomend this game over RE6?
[1:43:43] <%TweetHeart> @djinnazz yes
[1:43:47] <mobiusnightshade> @vexicbayn Lucky Ted begs to differ.
[1:43:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Djinnazz yes
[1:44:06] <Djinnazz> ok, cool. Might check this out.
[1:44:35] <%Jekado> if you do get it use the link below
[1:44:38] <%shocknawful> more stats, get huge
[1:44:44] <vexicbayn> Lucky Ted is so lucky he was born with max dex
[1:45:13] <%TweetHeart> the screenshots on steam really don't do this justice. may get it in the future now that I've seen the game proper.

[1:46:32] <%MrBorisMakarov> Idea for whip if it doesn't exist, special is that it brings an enemy closer to you but it stuns it for a short time
[1:46:36] <mobiusnightshade> If it gives him a spear, it'll be a Woolie toothpick run. XD
