[0:09:38] <Katorskay> This isn't mario maker 2...
[0:09:38] <Kokebear> chill music
[0:09:55] <+projectmanatees> thinking of getting this game for ps4, will i able to enjoy all the content or will being stuck to a controller make the end game stuff not fun?
[0:09:57] <BunnyEmperor> nope
[0:10:03] <+Crippl3> stream is good
[0:10:04] <thwak> stream's fine
[0:10:05] <Thalchampz> it's good here on my end

[0:10:16] <Thalchampz> G U N G U N
[0:10:30] <%nanaki_ff14> @projectmanatees No PS4 is great play on a pro myself in 4k. Controller is really good Pat even plays Controller on PC
[0:10:34] <Sorrowful_Suicide> @projectmanatees This game is super controller friendly, one of the best imho
[0:10:36] <+Rose_Silver> @projectmanatees engdame stuff can be done wih controller, most people prefer controller
[0:10:40] <%Psyramics> Your boy is dumber than animated broom
[0:10:44] <Kghaleon> how do you level sync now? I don't even see the option anymore.
[0:10:46] <$sylphyyyy> lmao parent my child for me, please stranger
[0:10:54] <%Guardiansaiyan> The ONLY way to play
[0:11:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> yes yes he is
[0:11:01] <%Guardiansaiyan> thank gods
[0:11:14] <+Angrec> @AngriestPat if you have the sds fenrir it gets around the stupid move speed issue since its always +1 movement on the ground till maxed
[0:11:18] <%Guardiansaiyan> Regular Chonk Chocobo
[0:11:27] <haisho> Oh god Yoshikage Kira's wet dream right outside that city
[0:11:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> m&k is the inferior way to play
[0:11:43] <Kokebear> The game was designed with controller in mind, so yes, it does work very well.
[0:11:44] <+Estuko> @clempstwitch I barely started just to test it out, getting the controller's buttons figured out is PRETTY comfortable
[0:11:45] <+projectmanatees> thank you all for the help <3
[0:11:51] <$valriot> The GCD makes it 100% playable, even to highest tier
[0:11:57] <Karakuioshi> It also didn't have Auto Attack LUL
[0:12:20] <Kokebear> For me personally, I've found it much easier to use a controller. I've also realized I feel much more immersed using a controller. That's part of the reason I never got that into other MMOs.
[0:12:24] <BunnyEmperor> lmao Pat
[0:12:48] <bestwaifuritsu> wow someone actually cared enough about the midan gear to glam it
[0:12:53] <Thenuclearwalrus> I love their voices LUL
[0:12:58] <+Estuko> @Kokebear I recently had my whole right arm crushed in an accident so having to keep it lifted for keyboard play sucks. so letting my arm rest w/ a acontroller where I just move my fingers helps a LOT
[0:13:01] <Jolnir> its definitely fully functional and enjoyable with controller
[0:13:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> that guy has HUGE BALLS
[0:13:21] <shiny_prinny> Shiny hunting
