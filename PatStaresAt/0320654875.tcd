[0:01:57] <%deviljhojho94> MOTIVATED
[0:02:01] <OkamiDude15> lady sure did beat a whole lot of demons while dante and vergil fought shirtless in the rain woopsKek
[0:02:02] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> probably gonna fall asleep midstream Pat why you do this
[0:02:06] <TheyCallMeVawn> Playing Vergil without Woolie huh
[0:02:08] <+TransporterX7> I guess we're motivated now
[0:02:09] <%CerberusDriver> Vergil is so fucking fun in DMC4
[0:02:11] <Dragonfang1337> DMC4 STREAM WHAT?
[0:02:11] <CMSpunky> 900p the perfect. THE PERFECT calibration
[0:02:15] <Heiderne> Hop in the Vergilmobile
[0:02:17] <%CerberusDriver> hes also very OP in 4
[0:02:22] <god__of__lore> Vergil is fun in anything
[0:02:22] <radical_skeleton> woolie isn't here because if he was he would just be beating his meat the entire time
[0:02:22] <+drfaustisdead> can Pat's motivation defeat my determination?
[0:02:24] <PKFIORE> The vergilmobile RETURNS
[0:02:26] <~AngriestPat> its 900p cause it'll be at 60fps and 1080 can make the bitrate shit
[0:02:27] <CappuccinoGuil> @OkamiDude15 can you blame Woolie, though? I WISH that was the original scene in DMC3
[0:02:28] <PKFIORE> I CANNOT WAIT
[0:02:28] <mercado94> oh god fuck the vergilmobile
[0:02:29] <%Jpdodds> @Heiderne Fuck you I forgot about the vergilmobile
[0:02:34] <+Toblo1> Has Pat said anything about doing DMC4 after the DMC3 LP?
[0:02:36] <rhus> VERGILMOBILE
[0:02:36] <Dragonfang1337> I finished DMC4 vergil a little bit ago because of the DMC lets plays PogChamp
[0:02:37] <TheyCallMeVawn> Lady is honestly probably my favorite character to play in DMC4
[0:02:42] <%Jpdodds> @Heiderne That game is worse than I remembered
[0:02:46] <%LastSonofOdin> DMC4 secWoo
[0:02:46] <Heiderne> It’s the best part of DmC
[0:02:50] <Magnetgear> is pat secretly watching me play Dmc4?
[0:02:51] <itsya_boi_gappy> lady is really easy
[0:02:52] <%craig_t> cheer200 Any chance you'll ever take a look at Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines, either for personal fun, stream, or LP? I got it up running again recently (less work than modding NV) and it is the most beautiful janky madness.
[0:02:55] <CMSpunky> That's all good 60fps I care more about.
[0:02:56] <%LastSonofOdin> seqWoo
[0:02:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Turbo super vergil
[0:02:58] <Heiderne> That or Vergil killing a defenseless pregnant woman

[0:03:21] <zal_silverfang> @Heiderne hands down worse vergil. Worse then Donte
[0:03:22] <%CerberusDriver> they made a DmC video ages ago
[0:03:23] <Tuskor13> That Gameboy blood war yesterday was amazing
[0:03:24] <bentface> does the timeline work out with Vergil having force edge in the flashback this takes place in?
[0:03:24] <%Sirculbs> Damnit. It's 11. I have work tomorrow. Why you do dis?
[0:03:26] <XdaXcaptainX> the fuck is this
[0:03:28] <%Jpdodds> @Heiderne That bit didn't bother me as much as FUUUUCKKKKK YOOOUUUUUU

[0:15:35] <SailingSaturn> I wonder why they talked about it cirThink
[0:15:36] <Heiderne> #DeleteQuebec
[0:15:36] <Ropcord> FOR SOME REASON 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔
[0:15:38] <+Templar15> klaigeHMM
[0:15:38] <%ssjklyco> Dante feels better
[0:15:38] <%Hilleltaco> Definitely not for an LP that'd be ridiculous
[0:15:41] <%PipIV> ?
[0:15:42] <gorillahandz> I like playing Dante more in 4 than in 3 but the game is not built around him well imo
[0:15:43] <gustavozxd> dmc4 enemy design is frustrating but i can get over it..... sometimes
[0:15:49] <Mattmandx1> I honestly don't like Nero's moveset that much. The Red Queen is awkward to use to me
[0:15:50] <+khalcipher> WHY WOULD YOU BE TALKING ABOUT THAT YOU CRAZY PAT

[0:15:52] <+ZeOrbling> BUT

[0:15:56] <TheyCallMeVawn> 4SE is not better than 3SE. 4 does have the best gameplay tho.

[0:16:13] <ketchuo13> Vergil is the SHIT
[0:16:13] <%SuperCasualBoom> Pat be loving that but
[0:16:13] <radical_skeleton> 4 has the best gameplay but 3 has the best level design and learning curve
[0:16:15] <itsya_boi_gappy> nero alone is fun
[0:16:15] <Heiderne> 4 has the best gameplay but the game is unfinished
[0:16:16] <leinadtonu> 5?
[0:16:17] <%CerberusDriver> like 5 devils?
[0:16:17] <Phoenon> phanto2Yosha

[0:17:40] <Heiderne> DMC3 is actually really hard in some parts
[0:17:40] <%SuperCasualBoom> Like the Bayonetta
[0:17:41] <%Hilleltaco> Win fight without getting hit and look as cool as you can doing it
[0:17:44] <$Sayie> So Character Action games are just PvE fighting games? Kappa
[0:17:45] <Crankthulhu> Vampire Masquerade is actually kinda shit once you get into late game, even with patch

[0:18:45] <NopeBadguy> @rytisone High skill ceilings and moveset options, emphasis on varied moveset, and lots of emphasis on your own character's options vs the other characters in the game

[0:19:18] <Ropcord> SALTY STREAM PogChamp
[0:19:19] <NopeBadguy> @rytisone There's a lot more, but that's the nutshell. It's a lot of nuance in a sub-genre.
[0:19:19] <+aversal_ammar> Grandpa Pat

[0:19:41] <zal_silverfang> @SiegeJay to take a more artist stance on that. the older Lady Models really dont hold up and would also likely be a pain to rip. would take someone just completely redoing the models for anyone to be interested which no one seems to want to do
[0:19:42] <SuperSaiyanSora> @gustavozxd unfortunately after playing 1, I was suffering through 2, only played the beginning of 3, and never went back to that collection again doodBait yovgAwkward

[0:19:57] <LiquidMathew> also Spider-Carnage is sometimes cool, but other times badly designed
[0:19:57] <Bouldus> spooderman is fine
[0:19:57] <$Sayie> Carnage isn't edgy he's totally PG13 and safe for kids!
[0:19:58] <%crot45> Spiderman is lame

[0:50:22] <%Brain_Freeze_> @combomaniadeluxe concentration
[0:50:24] <%deviljhojho94> It's a pregnancy meter
[0:50:30] <+TheImmortal70> welp he's already started doing some dumb stuff
[0:50:32] <gustavozxd> the scarecrows in this game are the worst main enemies in the series tho
[0:50:33] <%Keyd00d> SMOKIN STYLE
[0:50:34] <Rao2357> I loved DMC3 Vergil when SE ht, but going back to it after playing 4 Vergil just feels awful
[0:50:34] <+vinivss> Im confused whatd the timeline in this series is 4 before 3 before 1 or what
[0:50:36] <jacknerik> does anyboy else get completely disorientated by the camera in this game?
[0:50:36] <Thalchampz> O O F
[0:50:37] <%deviljhojho94> When it's full, virgil impregnates everyone in a 30 km radius
[0:50:42] <Mattmandx1> Frame drops
[0:50:43] <$GohanEgret> frames go down
[0:50:44] <rytisone> Smokin', What is this? The mask?
[0:50:44] <+TheImmortal70> The game can't handle virgil's bullshit
[0:50:44] <TheGershon> I find with Vergil it really helps to map shoot to L1 and DT to Square
[0:50:45] <element_of_loyalty> Pat lost control
[0:50:49] <HoIlywood_SN> @vinivss 3142
[0:50:51] <Tucker0603> game is unstable

[0:50:58] <+Birdigalore> PC PORT FUCKERY
[0:51:00] <%Superstarsage> visual effect too stronk
[0:51:01] <TheBlankAce> Vergil is so calm he makes the frames stop
[0:51:01] <DeathByPoke7> bad port?
[0:51:01] <knomad2b> doodFps
[0:51:04] <%Noahccountingfortaste> weird. doesn't happen on mine
[0:51:05] <+aversal_ammar> The game is a bit fucky
[0:51:06] <Rao2357> 3 1 4 2 5 - Vergil here is mostly just for funzies, though he did knock someone up.
[0:51:08] <b1gboss007> Frame: D

[0:51:16] <+Zerodyne90> 3 1 4 2 V is the order I think
[0:51:17] <+elgueaga> u need more power
[0:51:17] <MeinKampfyC0uch> @vinivss 4SE Vergil -> DMC3 -> DMC1 -> DMC4 -> DMC2 -> DMC5
[0:51:18] <%korth367> capcom and ports dont go well together
[0:51:18] <element_of_loyalty> fore egde
[0:51:19] <HoIlywood_SN> yeah vergil blasted fully inside a girl
[0:51:20] <OkamiDude15> @combomaniadeluxe it lets you do judgement cuts mid combo if you tap attack at the right time
[0:51:20] <%mcofolk> Hey all
[0:51:21] <MoulesFritz> @AngriestPat it's a shitty PC port
[0:51:22] <TheGershon> Time to hex edit

[0:51:39] <SuperSaiyanSora> u should've been playing on PS4 Bruh
[0:51:39] <Dragonfang1337> it's fine if you lower I think just a few settings
[0:51:41] <gorillahandz> time to go to consoles
[0:51:41] <+Chud_Pudsley> LIKE DMC 4 Reg was fucking stable? PLEASE

[1:10:20] <%Jpdodds> DONT GET HHIT
[1:10:20] <DXLelouch24> he has to play calm

[1:10:34] <TerraWraith> I actually loaded up the pc version just to see, and I realized with my new monitor, i can play at 120 fps, and I'm not getting any frame drops at 2k. And my computer is for sure not as good as Pat's.

[1:10:58] <Mattmandx1> Woolie is right to love this character
[1:10:58] <DXLelouch24> you can also hold it for a few sec and get a perfect Judgement cut
[1:10:59] <bagheadlive> @Invisoguy np :)
[1:10:59] <Kataguro> How Un-Virgil
[1:11:00] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[1:11:03] <DXLelouch24> and it can be spammed
[1:11:07] <xeros720> not feeling terribly motivated you guys
[1:11:09] <%crimsonharvest> Are you gonna carve that fuckin thing or what, dont just leave it there.
[1:11:10] <+TheImmortal70> It's like exactly one second
[1:11:19] <Estuko> Now he's moderately motivated
[1:11:20] <Donchalant402> you did better with the laggy pc
[1:11:25] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Vergil needs some motivation
[1:11:26] <goddamndavid> wow you run so fast in this game
[1:11:26] <DXLelouch24> Pat stop running, your motivations going down
[1:11:26] <+TheImmortal70> If you hold it for exactly one second you get flawless dimensional slashes
[1:11:33] <Graxe_> Gotta practice those just frame instant Judgment Cuts.
[1:11:39] <+dodge_and_dust> agh. after playing him in BP so much it is messing with me to see him not do the perfect judgement cut
[1:11:40] <+imextremelymanly> yes
[1:11:44] <%deviljhojho94> Gotta let it out gotta let it out
[1:11:46] <DXLelouch24> ive gotten like 4-5 of em
[1:11:47] <DXLelouch24> in a row
[1:11:47] <+RogueInfinity> Hello o/
[1:11:57] <helpmeimafruit> not getting hit
[1:11:59] <Djinnazz> and not getting hit.
[1:12:00] <Kavtech> Yes.
[1:12:00] <Donchalant402> and not getting hit too
[1:12:01] <DXLelouch24> and walking
[1:12:01] <+TheImmortal70> Don't do anything vergil wouldn't do
[1:12:02] <%Divryne> YEs.
[1:12:02] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @AngriestPat it'll explain in a bit
[1:12:04] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> No hits, walking slowly, not missing
[1:12:05] <$GohanEgret> why do barrels have crystallized blood of demos, aka red orbs, in them
[1:12:05] <%Hilleltaco> Yeah pretty much
[1:12:05] <%badmr7> you can dodge
[1:12:05] <Estuko> @dodge_and_dust BP is a BLAST
[1:12:08] <%Divryne> Just be cool.
[1:12:09] <+RogueInfinity> How are you Pat? How are you chat?
[1:12:10] <$GohanEgret> demons*
[1:12:12] <%badmr7> Don't run in a fight
[1:12:12] <DXLelouch24> NO THEY WONT
[1:12:14] <gustavozxd> standing still you get the most @angriestpat
[1:12:16] <DXLelouch24> THEY WONT TELL YOU
[1:12:17] <MeowmereArt> be cool
[1:12:18] <Estuko> @GohanEgret because they're demons
[1:12:19] <xeros720> BE COOL PAT
[1:12:19] <Mattmandx1> He can teleport by using summoned swords to compensate for no running
[1:12:20] <Fujiwara_92> but you can doge
[1:12:22] <%deviljhojho94> Foolishness Patricio. Foolishness
[1:12:22] <Demon_chann> BE THE VERGIL PAT
[1:12:22] <DXLelouch24> THE GAME SAYD GIT GUD
[1:12:23] <TechDragon_Z> Ever watch Death Battle, Pat?
[1:12:25] <itsya_boi_gappy> pat when did you lose your hair
[1:12:26] <$lolslowking> I've played DMC3 Vergil misses all the fucking time
[1:12:27] <%badmr7> Meter give extra abilities
[1:12:30] <bagheadlive> god that part in the dmc3 LP where you're trying to find a crazy combo for nevan for 10+ minutes without looking at the in game movelist
[1:12:30] <mastermidget23> Dont spam swords until your coolness gets higher. Swords stall it.
[1:12:30] <Donchalant402> its literally the roleplay as vergil mechanic
[1:12:34] <Vorsun> Just be cool, man
[1:12:36] <LiquidMathew> Vergil's abilities and moves will grow stronger and faster the more calmly and flawlessly he fights.
[1:12:36] <$GohanEgret> @Estuko makes sense
[1:12:37] <+imextremelymanly> Just dodge everything
[1:12:39] <+dodge_and_dust> remember that he can teleport to the locked on enemy
[1:12:39] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 i gotta write a 8-15 minute presentation on the class and prison (prison practices, penal colonies, slave trade) what was that stuff you guys talked about where japan auto guilties an accused?
[1:12:41] <$mandragoraroot> WERE DYING
[1:12:41] <Graxe_> "Show me your motivation."
[1:12:44] <%AncelDeLambert> chat is the chat
[1:12:44] <Prism_Wing> Chat be like chat do, know what I mean?
[1:12:44] <ape_hawk> GORB
[1:12:45] <rytisone> just remember: what would Vergil do?
[1:12:50] <+AntithesisEK> how motivated are you, withered tiny barrel?
[1:12:50] <%Gogogolem> just be the second worst Dmc chacter after Donte.
[1:12:51] <vampireinarm> does this mean no LP on the channel
[1:12:52] <%Brain_Freeze_> There was never a blue orb there
[1:12:54] <%SneakTheBeak> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[1:12:56] <%deviljhojho94> WWVD?
[1:12:56] <ketchuo13> Vergil has some sick ass taunts when you get to S rank
[1:12:59] <helpmeimafruit> @awsomesaucekirby it's the documentary called phoenix wright ace attorney
[1:13:09] <DXLelouch24> -_-
[1:13:21] <Phoenon> Angelos already PogChamp
[1:13:30] <Demon_chann> OH SHIT
[1:13:31] <bagheadlive> hey DMC5 question, what's the origin of the gif dance? or was that just some random thing someone made?
[1:13:32] <+RogueInfinity> I can't wait for the new DMC to come out. New weapons look awesome.
[1:13:33] <+TheImmortal70> You get enemies like five stages early in LDK
[1:13:34] <DXLelouch24> Pat dont bullshit a bullshitter
[1:13:37] <DXLelouch24> we know its comin
[1:13:37] <%WorthlessSamurai> "Please Look Forward to It"
[1:13:41] <+Dehlome> it would be really funny if you played all of them except 4 on the channel
[1:13:43] <%deviljhojho94> LEGENDARY DANK KNIGHT
[1:13:49] <%DoctorDakka> Spam all the enemy types, the gamemode
[1:13:51] <+imextremelymanly> Keep that damage high
[1:13:53] <Estuko> big shield boys
[1:13:54] <itsya_boi_gappy> come on pat
[1:13:54] <helpmeimafruit> SCHUM
[1:13:55] <gustavozxd> oh god not these guys
[1:13:55] <xeros720> i look forward to Woolie's gameplay
[1:13:55] <MoulesFritz> legendary dark knight sucks tbh
[1:13:55] <rytisone> EASY MODE IS NOW SELECTABLE
[1:13:56] <$GohanEgret> you finna die baby
[1:14:04] <soutakuphi> DX, they already confirmed it on podcast, jesus christ man
[1:14:04] <Mattmandx1> Shields are hard for katana users to deal with
[1:14:05] <Joxardn> S C U M
[1:14:06] <+Zerodyne90> you're just bad
[1:14:08] <+TheImmortal70> It feels great when there aren't any angelos on the screen because you don't get fuckin PARRIED
[1:14:08] <+skyheys> @AngriestPat I wait eternally for the full DMC2, I want to watch you squirm.
[1:14:09] <%deviljhojho94> EASY MODE Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap EASY MODE
[1:14:09] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 I don't hear vocals Pat, at this rate you won't be getting a king crazy!
[1:14:10] <Estuko> Cutscene only mode available LUL
[1:14:13] <+TheImmortal70> This mod is the worst with angelos
[1:14:15] <+TheImmortal70> *mode
[1:14:20] <+dodge_and_dust> for those who have played this more. where does BP fit in difficulty wise compared to the story mode difficulties?
[1:14:21] <DarkSkyKing> Is this LDK?
[1:14:23] <Phoenon> @AngriestPat Try mashing Rapid Slash in Devil Trigger
[1:14:23] <+TheImmortal70> It really shows you how much getting blocked sucks
[1:14:25] <Inebriateddonut> Vergil has a longer combo in DT btw
[1:14:26] <%Hilleltaco> @AngriestPat In case you don't remember from last time, high concentration gives Yamato extra range, Force Edge extra hits, and Beowulf an extra charge level
[1:14:28] <gustavozxd> angelos are the worst in general tbh
[1:14:28] <+Hamblasto> "Don't do anything Vergil wouldn't do" as Vergil proceeds to mess up a tiny jump
[1:14:29] <DXLelouch24> not even an S
[1:14:29] <MoulesFritz> legendary dark knight is shitty and bad
[1:14:31] <DXLelouch24> what a scrub
[1:14:34] <Graxe_> Oh yeah, Rapid Slash can be chained in DT.
[1:14:40] <%badmr7> The Angelos hate starfall and rapid slash
[1:14:42] <gustavozxd> YEAH THAT SHEATING ANIMATION
[1:14:44] <+RogueInfinity> I think the main problem I have with DMC4 is that the HoH mode replaces enemies from the regular ones.
[1:14:46] <Naixoram> @dodge_and_dust BP starts at Easy and increases in difficulty as it goes on
[1:14:51] <%badmr7> Gets right behind them
[1:14:52] <+TheImmortal70> Angelos hate air oves
[1:14:53] <Naixoram> by the end it's at DMD difficulty
[1:14:54] <+imextremelymanly> Every move is extended in DT
[1:14:54] <DXLelouch24> pat hold JC for a few sec and you get a perfect JC
[1:14:56] <ketchuo13> Yamato combo A has 3 more hits in DT
[1:14:56] <+TheImmortal70> Air moves
[1:15:00] <DXLelouch24> like 2-3
[1:15:01] <+TheImmortal70> Almost like a certain enemy
[1:15:10] <Kataguro> Bwooom
[1:15:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> camera got sliced
[1:15:17] <itsya_boi_gappy> omg i love this game
[1:15:17] <Vorsun> Iai
[1:15:23] <DXLelouch24> YEA
[1:15:23] <Mattmandx1> An orb of CUTTING
[1:15:23] <+dodge_and_dust> @Naixoram so if you can beat BP then you can probably avoid getting wrecked on DMD difficulty?
[1:15:27] <+TheImmortal70> Stronger, faster version
[1:15:29] <DXLelouch24> AND IT CAN BE SPAMMED
[1:15:30] <%badmr7> There is an instant version before purple charge finishes
[1:15:33] <Naixoram> in theory
[1:15:35] <awsomesaucekirby> should one punch man be a character action game or muso/warriors?
[1:15:42] <%badmr7> before it turns purple
[1:15:43] <gustavozxd> you have to get used to the timing
[1:15:44] <+RogueInfinity> It's like the Reving for Red Queen
[1:15:46] <+imextremelymanly> Cut that air so fast it gets cut later
[1:15:49] <DXLelouch24> like 1-2 sec
[1:15:51] <ape_hawk> one punch man should be qte
[1:15:52] <+TheImmortal70> @angriestpat I think the thing that strikes me as most absurd is that the imperfect one has USES
[1:15:59] <DracaenaLeaf> YOUR FINISHED
[1:15:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @awsomesaucekirby no
[1:16:01] <%badmr7> Its just right before it turns purple pat
[1:16:02] <cherubsanonymous> HOW MUCH DID IS MISS
[1:16:02] <itsya_boi_gappy> SCUM
[1:16:03] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat ins't there a super version that costs 5k orbs?
[1:16:04] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat try holding it for half a second
[1:16:05] <Vorsun> SCUM
[1:16:08] <Demon_chann> SCUM
[1:16:08] <gustavozxd> there's no tech to it, just get used to it and fuck'em up
[1:16:09] <Phoenon> It's even harder in turbo mode
[1:16:13] <HannibalBeerus> imagine Dante seeing this
[1:16:13] <+dodge_and_dust> i find it easier to get on the second swing cause the motion of his hand gives you a super easy tell
[1:16:15] <+Griffin1171> One Punch Man should be a dating simulator
[1:16:20] <DXLelouch24> i mastered it in turbo mode tho
[1:16:20] <+Chud_Pudsley> Pat fixed the SE frame drop crap?
[1:16:20] <+TheImmortal70> Literally one second
[1:16:22] <cherubsanonymous> Okay not much clearly
[1:16:22] <$The_Esquana> Will there be an lp of this on the channel? @AngriestPat
[1:16:23] <Graxe_> @AngriestPat Every swing has different Judgment Cut timings. Even specials, like Rapid Slash and Upper Slash.
[1:16:24] <DXLelouch24> lol
[1:16:24] <%badmr7> timing is different for every swing
[1:16:25] <+dodge_and_dust> nice
[1:16:26] <$JohnAtDawn> Who voices Vergil here?
[1:16:27] <MoulesFritz> heaven or hell is the only true difficulty
[1:16:28] <%Brain_Freeze_> @awsomesaucekirby it would be a muso for saitama and then turn into a character action game for every other playable character
[1:16:29] <$GohanEgret> @Chud_Pudsley switched to PS4
[1:16:29] <+TheImmortal70> It is pretty much exactly one second
[1:16:37] <Vorsun> If you're thinking about it, you're taking too long
[1:16:39] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat i think you need to let go as soon as the animation begins
[1:16:39] <TechDragon_Z> Wonder how that looks in DT
[1:16:42] <itsya_boi_gappy> @JohnAtDawn same guy from 3
[1:16:54] <+imextremelymanly> Now you are motivated
[1:16:55] <Estuko> Demon chairs
[1:17:10] <Serge_12> GoodNight Pat! cashSleep cashSleep cashSleep
[1:17:15] <+Chud_Pudsley> @GohanEgret Lol just overpowering the game
[1:17:16] <$GohanEgret> why do BENCHES have DEMON BLOOD
[1:17:16] <+TheImmortal70> This is the same VA, just not sick LUL
[1:17:17] <Mattmandx1> Using summoned swords for these platform orbs is a real pain
[1:17:26] <+Paladin_Artorias> Show me your motivation, Patrick.
[1:17:30] <Estuko> LUL
[1:17:34] <%Superstarsage> my fingers hurt just watching this but it's so hype
[1:17:36] <Vorsun> Gotta use Grim Trick
[1:17:39] <$GohanEgret> coward
[1:17:42] <+dodge_and_dust> invisible ceiling
[1:17:42] <Graxe_> Vergil can grab orbs out of the air like Nero with his O summoned sword.
[1:17:43] <+Hamblasto> Remember, chat. Whenever Pat bumbles through something. "Don't do anything Vergil wouldn't do"
[1:17:43] <+Griffin1171> how embarrassing
[1:17:43] <%DoctorDakka> The Benches are soaked in blood from Smoking Sick Battles that happened before
[1:17:48] <%Hilleltaco> @AngriestPat The most clear perfect judgement cut is his first delay combo (1 2 delay 3) because you let go of the button as soon as the sword is sheathed
[1:17:51] <+TheImmortal70> LUL
[1:17:53] <Joxardn> You can just shoot orbs to get them
[1:17:56] <%MrBorisMakarov> LUL
[1:17:56] <Graxe_> It's just Snatch.
[1:17:58] <+RogueInfinity> Out of every character for DMC4:SE, whose is everyone's favorite?
[1:17:59] <Donchalant402> Vergil gets snatch for reasons
[1:18:00] <Estuko> @Superstarsage I hurt my fingers trying to do those extreme combos from youtube LUL
[1:18:01] <%badmr7> the instant j cut for the show me your motivation taunt is when he starts the sword florish
[1:18:08] <%deviljhojho94> Kill them all Pat
[1:18:11] <Phoenon> There's a secret mission in uncharted space
[1:18:12] <DXLelouch24> Vergil
[1:18:14] <SailingSaturn> you already did it though? cirThink
[1:18:23] <knomad2b> probs vergil
[1:18:25] <+dodge_and_dust> @RogueInfinity Vergil, perfect frame judgement cut all day
[1:18:27] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 Would One punch man make a better character action game or a muso/warriors? you wouldn't necissarily play as saitama, hell you could just be one of the other jobbers instead, be like in tales from the borderlands, all the cool people are around you, but not you.
[1:18:29] <+RogueInfinity> I like Trish the most.
[1:18:31] <TechDragon_Z> @RogueInfinity Vergil, easily. Way too much fun.
[1:18:31] <helpmeimafruit> reminder that the ugly stuttering son of a bitch got laid and dante didn't
[1:18:38] <DXLelouch24> unlike Neros Rev i can atleast master Vergils stuff
[1:18:42] <Storm_Samurai> Pat has more viewers than CapcomFighters lol
[1:18:56] <gustavozxd> trish is fun but whenever blitz shows up i turn the game off
[1:18:59] <%xemnahort> @rogueinfinity for me it’s lady something about her play style feels real good to me, close second is Vergil
[1:19:02] <Naixoram> if you let Vergil sheathe his sword after an attack it will explode the Summoned Swords stuck in an enemy
[1:19:03] <+rorschachsjournal505> No turbo mode?
[1:19:06] <+TheImmortal70> @DXLelouch24 Oh like trick canceling and momentum sword stops?
[1:19:07] <cherubsanonymous> Vergil is so fucking good in this
[1:19:11] <+imextremelymanly> get that S rank
[1:19:12] <Estuko> @awsomesaucekirby a massive hero list to use, it'd seem fun but the main character (saitama) not being playable kinda cuts it down weirdly
[1:19:15] <%DoctorDakka> Vergil's Menace walk is so good
[1:19:17] <itsya_boi_gappy> taunt
[1:19:17] <+RogueInfinity> Pat's too much of a wimp to play Turbo Mode
[1:19:19] <bagheadlive> the idea with Nero is to be Ex/Max Acting as much as possible right?
[1:19:19] <+RogueInfinity> Kappa
[1:19:20] <Foymic> in no rush :)
[1:19:24] <Prism_Wing> @helpmeimafruit Most people get laid. And you should see most people Kappa
[1:19:24] <%deviljhojho94> :)
[1:19:24] <Phoenon> DT Rapid Slash PogChamp
[1:19:27] <Mattmandx1> It took me forever to beat this secret mission as Nero but got it my first try with Vergil
[1:19:28] <medril07> do his motivation taunt
[1:19:30] <$mandragoraroot> :)
[1:19:31] <+Noni321> @AngriestPat Does Vergil even care about style points?
[1:19:31] <+dodge_and_dust> another one i find the just frame judgement cut easier on is the delayed aerial attack
[1:19:35] <+TheImmortal70> @bagheadlive Pretty much, just buffer attacks with revs
[1:19:38] <mrfoxberry> itd be glowing if you didnt do it
[1:19:48] <itsya_boi_gappy> LUL
[1:19:49] <DXLelouch24> PFFT
[1:19:49] <SailingSaturn> LUL
[1:19:49] <AsinineWaffle> LUL
[1:19:50] <%nitronLVIII> i think it carriesover bteween characters?
[1:19:51] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[1:19:52] <TerraWraith> Rapid Slash is the Yamato's stinger
[1:19:53] <McScuffed> LUL
[1:19:54] <gorillahandz> GOTTEM
[1:19:58] <mastermidget23> @AngriestPat Spamming sword shots will stall your style meter. If you just stand near them for a few seconds it shoots up much faster.
[1:19:59] <$mandragoraroot> m6kwRember pls rember
[1:19:59] <%badmr7> move
[1:20:01] <+RogueInfinity> But Lady's moveset is weird to me. I love it, but I'm too used to getting super close.
[1:20:01] <+dodge_and_dust> fuck that blade thing. always hit me
[1:20:07] <%deviljhojho94> Everyone not MOTIVATED on this chat, please leave. You are not welcome. FUNgineer
[1:20:08] <+rorschachsjournal505> I was super expecting that
[1:20:08] <%ThatRandomGuy661> You streamed it before. Twice.
[1:20:13] <jacknerik> I love the big punchy
[1:20:19] <+dodge_and_dust> yeah. DT rapid slash is neat
[1:20:20] <tank7013> @Noni321 He strikes me as the type that totally does but would never admit it
[1:20:23] <%ThatRandomGuy661> Days apart but yeah
[1:20:23] <DXLelouch24> yep
[1:20:25] <Donchalant402> big memory loss
[1:20:26] <%badmr7> J cut those guys
[1:20:27] <$mandragoraroot> m6kwLukeno
[1:20:28] <+TheImmortal70> Oh hey, witches, the worst enemy in the game
[1:20:31] <Estuko> @RogueInfinity I love her moveset, it's WEIRD to get used to, and takes practice for sure
[1:20:33] <ketchuo13> I thought Rapid Slash can lead into a launcher
[1:20:33] <%badmr7> tears off the mist
[1:20:34] <bagheadlive> @TheImmortal70 I just completed 3 for the first time and restarted 4 and I know Nero is simple compared to Dante but I wasn't sure if I was missing something
[1:20:37] <$mandragoraroot> m6kwRember PLS rember
[1:20:38] <mastermidget23> God I hate these enemies.
[1:20:42] <+imextremelymanly> you did stream it a long time ago
[1:20:45] <$GohanEgret> january of 2017, apparently
[1:20:45] <+Noni321> Vergil's a Tsundere?
[1:20:46] <%superorangerobin> Hey Pat sorry I'm late I was at Venom. It was stupid in the best way
[1:20:47] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 the correct answer is either a dating sim, telltale-like, or a yakuza like where you're some jobber hero at the very bottom of tthe ranks, as all this crazy shit happens around you and you work your way up to B
[1:20:57] <itsya_boi_gappy> he tryed it
[1:21:00] <%xxviios> You wore a Dante wig and everything
[1:21:03] <+rorschachsjournal505> You know what’s funny is that I super preferred Nero to Dante in terms of gameplay for a while. Until I spent a lot of time practicing, now it’s hard to go back to Nero
[1:21:04] <OkamiDude15> HIS COMBOS ARE SO COOL woopsHyper
[1:21:07] <medril07> rising dragon
[1:21:07] <Graxe_> Don't forget that because shooting summoned swords has no animation, he can shoot them whenever he wants. Their like his own assists in a way.
[1:21:07] <illsian> Pat's memory isnt what it used to be
[1:21:10] <helpmeimafruit> mephistos and fausts are the peak of enemy design, prove me wrong Kappa
[1:21:10] <Kavtech> Anyone here played Violet Detector? I'm playing it while I watch the stream and god damn is it fun.
[1:21:11] <%deviljhojho94> he wore a BLACK dante wig
[1:21:15] <+TheImmortal70> @bagheadlive There's still weird stuff you can do like invulnerable devil triggering through stuff and shuffle cancels, but yeah his major damage mechanic is just rhythm presses
[1:21:15] <+dodge_and_dust> so chat what is your preferred way to deal with the cloaks as Virgil?
[1:21:21] <%xxviios> lol
[1:21:23] <+imextremelymanly> hold square to get rid of these guys easy
[1:21:25] <+capnbeeb> shoulder mounted elmo
[1:21:26] <Jaxiis0> sipsipElmo
[1:21:26] <Estuko> @dodge_and_dust scream angrily
[1:21:28] <SulfurousAcid> Pat you are so good at dodging
[1:21:30] <mastermidget23> @dodge_and_dust Switching to Lady.
[1:21:31] <+TheImmortal70> So who likes witches as an enemy type?
[1:21:33] <Ranger747> the summon sword bararage
[1:21:33] <gorillahandz> these ghost fuckers are the worst
[1:21:34] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat you played trish/lady's campaign
[1:21:38] <Flickerember> It took me so long to figure out how to figh t those ghosts properly
[1:21:43] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat you streamed DMC4SE last year in january
[1:21:43] <%badmr7> If you J cut the mephistos you can tear the mist off faster
[1:21:43] <+ShikiHisashi> Swoard rain
[1:21:44] <%Hilleltaco> Interesting to note is that concentration doesn't go down from running when out of combat or when enemies are blocked off by something. Being cool only matters to Vergil when there's somebody to see it
[1:21:45] <+rorschachsjournal505> Summon sword ring
[1:21:45] <Mattmandx1> @rorschachsjournal505 Or you could just have Genos be the protagonist
[1:21:46] <MeowmereArt> one thing about nero is that i love table hopper.
[1:21:50] <Admiral_PopnFresh> considering how good he is at slicing through things, I'm surprised, from a thematic stand point, that Vergil opens his combo with the sheathed sword, seems...brutish
[1:21:51] <+ShikiHisashi> Why did I spell it like that...?
[1:21:52] <$GohanEgret> elmo wag tail
[1:21:59] <%Divryne> BAR
[1:22:02] <%ThatRandomGuy661> @AngriestPat Yeah you did it a couple days apart
[1:22:02] <quinnage7> @angriestpat so did you chuckle the first time you heard: " the time has come and so have I"?
[1:22:04] <TheyCallMeVawn> How does Vergil have Beowulf if this is before 3 Kappa
[1:22:09] <%SneakTheBeak> apatWink apatWink
[1:22:12] <bagheadlive> @TheImmortal70 Thanks for the tip, I'm trying to do it a lot this playthrough and it is kind of fun trying to get as many revs as possible, timing is a bit weird still
[1:22:25] <OkamiDude15> @TheyCallMeVawn because shut up thats why woopsKek
[1:22:25] <%xxviios> Hope those are on youtube
[1:22:28] <soutakuphi> @DXLelouch24 what was that about the game not explaining Concentration
[1:22:29] <helpmeimafruit> @TheyCallMeVawn Vergil has no time for pesky things like continuity
[1:22:31] <+dodge_and_dust> if you really don't feel like dealing with the cloaks then you just hold back and sqaure to knock them down right away
[1:22:33] <Donchalant402> they are
[1:22:39] <medril07> holy shit
[1:22:40] <DotDusk> Elmo is the goodest boy BibleThump
[1:22:41] <+dodge_and_dust> need DT for that i think though
[1:22:44] <+TheImmortal70> @bagheadlive It's VERY late. Like, as soon as your sword starts plus half a second
[1:22:44] <$mandragoraroot> PogChamp
[1:22:53] <SuperSaiyanSora> i wish they called that the Motivation Gauge yovgLUL
[1:22:56] <%badmr7> Left out a couple things, extended range on yamato, 3rd charge for beo, and multihit for edge
[1:22:57] <medril07> I was wondering what that was
[1:22:58] <Mattmandx1> Funneled
[1:22:59] <$Niney_Who> This seems very claustrophobic
[1:23:03] <+imextremelymanly> damage is so low
[1:23:05] <Graxe_> You can just spam DT Rapid Slash and he'll rush around the room like crazy.
[1:23:07] <%xxviios> Wait this is a pre prequel?
[1:23:10] <xeros720> one day we'll be motivated
[1:23:11] <bagheadlive> @TheImmortal70 Yeah that's what I'm learning, though I've heard that's changing in 5
[1:23:12] <+Instagig> Pat on the side while I play skyrim, ayyy
[1:23:13] <itsya_boi_gappy> i wonder how pats dmc4 dante is
[1:23:14] <+TheImmortal70> Damage is low because he's not Vergiling hard enough
[1:23:20] <$GohanEgret> LUL
[1:23:23] <$Niney_Who> Virgil hits like little baby
[1:23:24] <gustavozxd> @itsya_boi_gappy oh no
[1:23:25] <%Hilleltaco> Rapid slashing back and forth in DT is so cool, super effective too
[1:23:34] <%Agami23> what difficulty is this?
[1:23:36] <itsya_boi_gappy> LUL @gustavozxd
[1:23:37] <%Brain_Freeze_> @xxviios order is 3 1 4 2 5
[1:23:38] <+dodge_and_dust> oh god. why would you use Beowulf DT on a bunch of enemies in a line?
[1:23:45] <OkamiDude15> @Agami23 legendary dark knight
[1:23:45] <+TheImmortal70> Vergil is LITERALLY the strongest character in the game
[1:23:51] <bagheadlive> frustration is getting bigger?
[1:23:52] <medril07> what difficulty is this?
[1:23:54] <+TheImmortal70> There is nothing you can't combo and kill
[1:23:54] <helpmeimafruit> is ldk mode's base difficulty devil hunter or son of sparda?
[1:23:58] <%Agami23> ohh that explains it
[1:23:59] <$RaikenTB> did the same group that did the music for 3 do this?
[1:24:03] <%Agami23> so many enemy
[1:24:03] <+TheImmortal70> Son of sparda with a horde of enemies
[1:24:07] <Dragonfang1337> SMOKIN
[1:24:13] <deersuplexer> SO FUCKING COOlk
[1:24:13] <tank7013> So is there ever an explanation for how Vergil has Beowulf here?
[1:24:19] <Naixoram> no
[1:24:21] <%iwishthiswasicq> Yeah, it's dlc.
[1:24:24] <+RogueInfinity> Has he beat the Vergil Playthrough yet? D:
[1:24:24] <Dragonfang1337> None, it's just for gameplay
[1:24:25] <bagheadlive> He's just that good
[1:24:25] <$Niney_Who> Shut up tho
[1:24:29] <Naixoram> it's just gameplay being separated from story
[1:24:30] <Graxe_> Aw yeah, that summoned sword taunt that actually has a hitbox on the sword he spins.
[1:24:32] <Donchalant402> jesus
[1:24:34] <medril07> did he twirl a summoned sword?
[1:24:34] <Naixoram> ludonarrative memessence
[1:24:39] <Donchalant402> thats a lot of rorbs
[1:24:42] <OkamiDude15> @AngriestPat when you have SSS rank do an high time into taunt for funsies
[1:24:42] <TerraWraith> His SSS taunt does damage on the summoned sword
[1:24:43] <+TheImmortal70> @tank7013 He has force edge too. It's literally just copy and pasting his moveset and improving it slightly
[1:24:48] <+dodge_and_dust> don't you get extra style for hitting someone with that sword taunt?
[1:24:53] <helpmeimafruit> vergil's campaign makes no sense anyway so just give him all his weapons
[1:25:05] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Your attack hitboxes get bigger the more concentration you have.
[1:25:09] <Vorsun> Dumpster diving for rorbs
[1:25:16] <+imextremelymanly> give him the weapon he gets in the future
[1:25:25] <+TheImmortal70> It goes 3142, but vergil in 4 happens before 3
[1:25:31] <+dodge_and_dust> i really wish that characters other then Nero could counter enemies.
[1:25:33] <gustavozxd> in the future past
[1:25:34] <%xxviios> WHY NOT?!
[1:25:40] <justcauseican4> twitch is being shitty on my end tonight so I'm just gonna dip. I'll catch the vod. :(
[1:25:41] <tank7013> @TheImmortal70 Makes sense
[1:25:45] <$Niney_Who> @TheImmortal70 That's super unnecessary and confusing
[1:25:46] <Vorsun> CHRIST
[1:25:52] <medril07> his hair was down in that cutscene hahaha
[1:26:01] <$RaikenTB> WutFace
[1:26:02] <SailingSaturn> wow cirWut
[1:26:02] <itsya_boi_gappy> holy moly
[1:26:08] <+TheImmortal70> @Niney_Who Who would've thought that a game series that got narrative direction in it's third game would be confusing
[1:26:08] <+Raymanguy13> jeez
[1:26:09] <bagheadlive> @Niney_Who Blame the dev team that made DMC2 for that
[1:26:09] <medril07> time to cut dimensions
[1:26:11] <MeowmereArt> PogChamp
[1:26:11] <OkamiDude15> YEYEYEYEY
[1:26:12] <itsya_boi_gappy> SSS
[1:26:14] <tank7013> God DAMN
[1:26:14] <helpmeimafruit> stinger spam = SSS LUL
[1:26:15] <DXLelouch24> PARTYS TOO CHURAZY
[1:26:16] <Fujiwara_92> That's a lot of dudes
[1:26:16] <HoIlywood_SN> reminder that Vergil blasted inside of some chick and Dante still hasnt and never will
[1:26:16] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 y'know what both I and woolie would like? if MHW got a frame-fighter equivalent, but with a system where your character is based off of a combination of weapon type for moves, complete armour set/weapon abilities and stats (think of the weapon as the style, and the monster the armour and weapon are made of as a character)
[1:26:16] <ghostravens> should i get DMC4SE if i'm BAD at character action games but enjoy them anyways?
[1:26:19] <DXLelouch24> ABORT ABORT
[1:26:20] <cherubsanonymous> I LOVE THAT TAUNT SO MUCH
[1:26:21] <$RaikenTB> Trophy PogChamp
[1:26:22] <%SaltyDongs> Demo
[1:26:22] <silverira> Welcome to SE motherhumper
[1:26:22] <XdaXcaptainX> the only part of the vergil campaign anyone should take at face value is that cutepie giving him the fuk eyes in the opening cutscene
[1:26:22] <SailingSaturn> So thats why they say to grind on this mode LUL
[1:26:23] <+dodge_and_dust> remember if you ever want to say FUCKT this to a room. use judgement cut end
[1:26:25] <Jaxiis0> wrath of the raging demo
[1:26:25] <Inebriateddonut> SMOKIN SICK STREAM
[1:26:28] <%MaiHusbando9S> that is one raging demo
[1:26:30] <itsya_boi_gappy> and there he go
[1:26:34] <OkamiDude15> LETS HAVE SOME FUN woopsHyper
[1:26:41] <TheyCallMeVawn> Yes @ghostravens . Neros pretty simple to play and Dantes OP in general.
[1:26:42] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Will the Devil Cry?
[1:26:42] <%nitronLVIII> man theyre so stingy with red orbs in this game you better go buy some from the store Kappa
[1:26:46] <DXLelouch24> yea im gonna test this mode after the stream
[1:26:47] <+TheImmortal70> @ghostravens If you've never played it before by all means, however 3 is a superior game in terms of overall game.
[1:26:49] <+imextremelymanly> so many style ranking puppets
[1:26:54] <knomad2b> wait what mode is this?
[1:26:55] <$SGrim> "No Dante, this is NOT a crazy party!" rooKek
[1:26:56] <MeowmereArt> that moonwalk
[1:27:00] <DXLelouch24> LDK
[1:27:00] <+Robopengy> Nice moonwalk
[1:27:02] <+Raymanguy13> moonwalk tho
[1:27:04] <OkamiDude15> @knomad2b legendary dark knight
[1:27:06] <+dodge_and_dust> @knomad2b LDK
[1:27:09] <bagheadlive> i wonder if the chat could convince Pat to buy Proud Souls off the PSN store?
[1:27:10] <%Hilleltaco> If you launch an enemy with force edge and immediately do his SSS taunt, they'll land right on it and get juggled
[1:27:12] <$spardanwarrior> Seeing so many enemies at once feels so weird
[1:27:19] <DXLelouch24> you playing on Turbo Pat?
[1:27:20] <helpmeimafruit> i'm just a scrub but i don't understand the need for anything other than swordmaster for dante in 4 besides very specific circumstances
[1:27:20] <DotDusk> People see a lot of enemies, for Pat those are just Orbs he didn't get yet. LUL
[1:27:28] <Luis_bardock12349> Hey what's up Pat? lovin' the skelly friend in the back
[1:27:36] <+imextremelymanly> way funner
[1:27:39] <MeowmereArt> its just a feels good mode
[1:27:41] <%Divryne> LEGENDARY DANK KNIGHT.
[1:27:42] <tank7013> @nitronLVIII And I've seen reports that you get MORE on average in 5, the one that everyone is complaining about
[1:27:43] <XdaXcaptainX> KILL 1 BILLION DEMONS
[1:27:44] <knomad2b> damn, i need to replay se then
[1:27:47] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Skelly friend is bonely
[1:27:48] <+Dovakhin573> I hope when nero faces off against Vergil in DMCV he mocks his motivation line
[1:27:53] <JoshuaGLewis> I cant believe Vergil is even better in this game than he was in DMC3
[1:27:54] <goddamndavid> No, Pat, now is not the time for CUH-RAZY PARTY! Your life is in danger! These are not good times, Pat these are dark times for you!
[1:27:57] <medril07> is his hair down? how did you do that?
[1:28:00] <+Robopengy> Does Vergil have multiple weapons in this game?
[1:28:00] <SulfurousAcid> it's combo video mode
[1:28:08] <+dodge_and_dust> i think Dante is the only character i never really understood how to play right in this game. all the others i at least got decent with but i really cannot get used to style switching
[1:28:09] <Mattmandx1> @helpmeimafruit Trickster is good for bosses and Gunslinger has great crowd control ability. Royal Guard is the actual strongest style if mastered
[1:28:12] <%LymanAl> legendary dork knight
[1:28:13] <mr_slaide> WE DEMAND ELMO!
[1:28:20] <+dodge_and_dust> @Robopengy yes
[1:28:21] <+TheImmortal70> Can we be real here?
[1:28:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Thank you pat, thanks to your streamchat I can successfully use perfect judgement cut like 8 times in succession
[1:28:25] <DXLelouch24> 5s gonna be great, Capcom forced them to add the MTX, Matt Walkers interview on not wanting to add the Deluxe suff confirms as much
[1:28:25] <+Griffin1171> I can't play LDK mode because the load times are way too long on my PC
[1:28:26] <+TheImmortal70> I don't like any of dantes weapons in this game
[1:28:29] <bagheadlive> DMC5 would still be better off without the red orb MTXs, even just to get the stain off
[1:28:29] <helpmeimafruit> Vergil: I need more power, Nero: I've got all the power I need, DEVIL MAY CRY: CIVIL WAR
[1:28:30] <OkamiDude15> @Robopengy he has 3: yamato, force edge, and beowulf
[1:28:30] <+AnarchyAndyTV> do you have to do anything for this mode ???
[1:28:35] <%xxviios> You gonna do the LP in legendary dark knight mode lol
[1:28:36] <gmarchant> Don't forget you can get perfect judgement cuts after literally any move
[1:28:36] <+Chud_Pudsley> Deep down inside I want Vergil to say Dante's dumbest lines.
[1:28:39] <+Robopengy> @OkamiDude15 Thnx
[1:28:39] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You have to fight
[1:28:41] <+ShikiHisashi> It's also a bit of Dynasty Warriors with all the many demons
[1:28:41] <gustavozxd> @dodge_and_dust dante in DMC4 is trash unless you're a pro that knows shit like guard flying
[1:28:46] <ghostravens> the amount of enemies almost makes it look like a musou game
[1:28:50] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Those beowulf boots make vergil look like a furry
[1:29:02] <OkamiDude15> @AnarchyAndyTV its there when you boot up special edition of 4
[1:29:04] <$RaikenTB> was this mode even possible on the ps3/360?
[1:29:05] <medril07> has he said the motivation line yet?
[1:29:09] <gmarchant> It's especially good after the Yamato stinger and after after air rave 2
[1:29:10] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Vergil is a furry tho
[1:29:15] <DXLelouch24> missing lowers it too Pat
[1:29:16] <+TheImmortal70> His first extra weapon is a fist weapon, his second one is a command input gun that you just do fullcircles three times on, and lastly his second weapon.... is another closerange fist like weapon?
[1:29:17] <+AnarchyAndyTV> oh ok cool
[1:29:17] <Jaxiis0> @Chud_Pudsley with the straightest face
[1:29:20] <gustavozxd> @raikentb this mode is new for the SE
[1:29:32] <+AnarchyAndyTV> I'll have to try this
[1:29:33] <+TheImmortal70> Lucifer is a cool idea but I just don't like it
[1:29:37] <SirAlan76> I kind of want dmc5 to have weird legendary dark knight mode
[1:29:38] <DXLelouch24> getting hit, running, and missing hits lowers the gauge
[1:29:39] <%badmr7> The teleport can interrupt moves so you don't have to wait for the cooldown on swings
[1:29:40] <helpmeimafruit> @AngriestPat did you see the "BUY RED ORBS TO REVIVE" prompt that covers the screen when you die in DMC5?
[1:29:40] <$grandark_z317> did Pat forget how to roll?
[1:29:42] <%iwishthiswasicq> Oh shit, are the angels fighting the demons?
[1:29:46] <medril07> oh they're fighting the demons
[1:29:49] <+hoenhime344> alrighty, im here, bringthe strippers and booze
[1:29:49] <bagheadlive> yeah Lucifer was too weird for me, weirder then Nevan
[1:29:49] <Phoenon> LUL
[1:29:50] <%Afterman_> lucifer is the best!
[1:29:52] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Vergil is NOT a busty samurai
[1:29:53] <gustavozxd> Lucifer is the worst weapon in the franchise along with pandora
[1:29:55] <+Chud_Pudsley> @Jaxiis0 THE STRAIGHEST FACE
[1:29:56] <awsomesaucekirby> what if the brutes from borderlands were in here?
[1:29:57] <JoshuaGLewis> @RaikenTB realistically, no. The original version squeezed alot of performance out of those machines, and this just adds more on top of that
[1:30:00] <TheyCallMeVawn> Lucifer just doesnt feel fun to me
[1:30:02] <+Hamblasto> Is style easier to build on harder difficulties what with the greater number of enemies?
[1:30:08] <tank7013> Man I would play the ever living fuck out of a DMC Musou. As long as it wasn't a shit one like the Berserk game
[1:30:09] <DXLelouch24> They added a hat to get more orbs
[1:30:10] <gustavozxd> lucifer and pandora are so godamn bad good lord
[1:30:11] <%Hilleltaco> I neeever figured out Lucifer
[1:30:11] <DXLelouch24> A HAT
[1:30:14] <DXLelouch24> ITS FINE
[1:30:15] <+AnarchyAndyTV> the dante hat though
[1:30:20] <+imextremelymanly> Its great as a combo extender
[1:30:20] <Dragonfang1337> Abjudicators respawn I think
[1:30:22] <+TheImmortal70> I wouldn't feel so bad about lucifer if it wasn't beset by the fact is should've just been another part of gilgamesh
[1:30:22] <%Afterman_> smh at all the lucifer hate
[1:30:25] <itsya_boi_gappy> what do you mean pat Kappa
[1:30:28] <MonsieurHedge> anybody notice how lucifer's projectiles look just like mundus' projectiles?
[1:30:29] <medril07> switch on the fly
[1:30:29] <bagheadlive> If red orb MTXs don't effect DMC5's gameplay, they shouldn't even be there lol
[1:30:31] <+AnarchyAndyTV> jojo dante
[1:30:31] <rhetoricalAcrobat> Lucifer is maybe my favorite weapon of dantes- i love just setting a thousand exploding needles in a dude, launching them, and then swapping to lucifer to juggle them in the air witht he explosion
[1:30:33] <+TheImmortal70> Like seriously, imagine gilgamesh punch and kicks, but WITH Lucifer
[1:30:33] <DXLelouch24> i replaced Lucifer with an Agni Rudra mod
[1:30:33] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Why would people who suck enough to have to buy red orbs buy DMC5 to begin with though 🤔
[1:30:33] <+dodge_and_dust> are these things really supposed to be difficult to break?
[1:30:34] <$RaikenTB> Pat what happened to your focus?
[1:30:34] <$Sayie> in DMC4 it's an absolute waste to buy orbs because you can easily without grinding buy all of the HP and DT upgrades
[1:30:34] <DXLelouch24> lol
[1:30:36] <gustavozxd> you can buy gold orbs so same thing
[1:30:38] <+Talbz> @AngriestPat C'mon, show us those Just-Judgement Cuts
[1:30:38] <SulfurousAcid> I forgot they were like this in his mode
[1:30:45] <Phoenon> Oh yeah don't you have Judgement Cut End now?
[1:30:47] <SulfurousAcid> *game
[1:30:47] <%badmr7> Teleport everywhere
[1:30:48] <knomad2b> i love lucifer. hated nevan tho, shit still makes no sense to me
[1:30:48] <Naixoram> @AngriestPat you also have to go completely out of your way to even see the prompt to go to the store in DMC5. You have to die, choose the Red Orb option, then explicitly choose an option that is completely greyed out because you don't have enough orbs. only then will it show up
[1:30:53] <Djinnazz> meh
[1:30:54] <$Niney_Who> Stop DRINKING THOSE
[1:30:54] <%Agami23> does dmc5 have proud souls? if not, thats a big step down
[1:30:57] <Donchalant402> Just roleplay as vergil how hard can it be
[1:30:58] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> GO FOR BROKE!!
[1:30:58] <Naixoram> People get freaked for nothing
[1:30:59] <OkamiDude15> @Phoenon did he buy it in the shop?
[1:31:02] <Mattmandx1> No cutscene, just boss
[1:31:03] <itsya_boi_gappy> i love this boss fight
[1:31:03] <+imextremelymanly> take this guy out in 1 minute go
[1:31:05] <Vorsun> - BERIAL -
[1:31:05] <+hoenhime344> no rwby weapon tonight?
[1:31:09] <gustavozxd> it's like people never played any dmc game and are complaining for the sake of complaining
[1:31:10] <Phoenon> Pretty sure he bought everything in Yamato's area in shop
[1:31:11] <cherubsanonymous> It's right below the hardest difficulty in the game
[1:31:11] <+dodge_and_dust> fuck this guy as Virgil.
[1:31:12] <madogod> wtf pat? are you not gonna play it on the channel?
[1:31:13] <+ShikiHisashi> Sworn for Sword
[1:31:15] <+hoenhime344> or rwby weapons feet?
[1:31:20] <+TheImmortal70> This guy as vergil is the EASIEST
[1:31:22] <cherubsanonymous> Berial is so cool
[1:31:23] <+TheImmortal70> It's with dante that I struggle
[1:31:24] <+imextremelymanly> No the damage
[1:31:24] <gustavozxd> fuck this guy in general tbh
[1:31:28] <DXLelouch24> OH standing still raises your meter too
[1:31:28] <rytisone> look at this graphics show off at the time
[1:31:32] <DXLelouch24> RAISES IT ALOT
[1:31:33] <Phoenon> @AngriestPat Try looking up how to do Judgement Cut End

[1:31:51] <+dodge_and_dust> you gain it fastest if your standing still and not locked on

[1:34:53] <+zaworldo> How long have we been here?
[1:34:54] <xemeas> vergil trivializes eveything
[1:34:58] <bagheadlive> why does everyone think the uppercuts are Ryu references? They're clearly Allen Snider references

[1:36:05] <EBT93> Man, I really wish Vergil’s Rising Sun wasn’t tied to DT
[1:36:05] <+imporia_> Haha that's just like the thing that vergil says
[1:36:07] <helpmeimafruit> is AGNUS WINDOW the lamest boss in the entire series, including DmC?
[1:36:09] <rumuloh> @SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz I read that as a Cabella character action game

[1:36:40] <awsomesaucekirby> @tank7013 Have Squiggly use CC oves like a champ
[1:36:40] <gmarchant> Like running forward and swinging two swords at once isn't really his thing
[1:36:46] <yendoria> Reminder that Dante could totally dual-wield Rebellion and Alastor for the ultimate moveset if Itsuno desired it
[1:36:47] <bagheadlive> I do hope there's an open to hold the button for crazy combos in DMC5, I'm also disabled similar to paige and though I was able to beat it, DMC3 did hurt to play at times
[1:36:50] <rumuloh> Do a distorted real impact on this deer

[1:39:04] <%Beough> Does anyone know the song that plays when Pat was in the store menu?
[1:39:07] <Naixoram> @AngriestPat if you let Vergil sheathe the sword after an attack it explodes the summoned swords in enemies
[1:39:10] <DXLelouch24> count as extra hits
[1:39:13] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Vergil would never run
[1:39:14] <Vorsun> Gotta be cool
[1:39:14] <rytisone> easy peasy chicken dinner
[1:39:23] <%deviljhojho94> The time has come and so has Pat
[1:39:24] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Put it back to Hard Mode
[1:39:24] <XdaXcaptainX> wow this is like 20 times easier
[1:39:26] <medril07> \no wonder he always has to fix his hair. it's falling down just standing there
[1:39:26] <$BeardedLuchador> Fun fact, when I tested this game before release I went nuts because they extended Virgil's storyline. I knew V was coming
[1:39:28] <SWFanatic> Elmo don't fall
[1:39:28] <EBT93> Play like Vergil
[1:39:34] <Graxe_> Yeah, Vergil swings so fast, his afterimages hurt enemies.
[1:39:36] <%deviljhojho94> That phrase slaps

[1:40:45] <%KaizenChaos> he will not fall, he will plummet
[1:40:47] <%ssjklyco> Maybe she's born with it, Maybe it's motivated
[1:40:52] <+Yeajow> Vergil has a few hidden dt moves btw
[1:40:53] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @zal_silverfang Because Platinum never loses its LUSTER
[1:40:54] <+imporia_> after a while lemon squeezy
[1:40:57] <+imextremelymanly> good for farming
[1:41:02] <%xemnahort> TableHere
[1:41:04] <EBT93> You only lose it if you run while enemies are spawned
[1:41:06] <+shivhappy22> what happened to the DQ11 vod?
[1:41:08] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Just use LDK to grind shit out
[1:41:09] <HyraFukit> I love how easy Pat makes DMC look.
[1:41:14] <$RaikenTB> This music sounds like Half-Life.
[1:41:16] <+imextremelymanly> drive is very strong, must use more
[1:41:19] <OkamiDude15> vergil is super good
[1:41:20] <bagheadlive> @shivhappy22 check pat's twitter
[1:41:21] <%Mornaka> @Horificius no exclamation point
[1:41:21] <cherubsanonymous> I love how Vergil's drive is just pure black
[1:41:25] <+dodge_and_dust> no overdrive?
[1:41:26] <+CaptainJax> datsa good button
[1:41:29] <rhetoricalAcrobat> God his roundtrip is so fucking cool?
[1:41:29] <zal_silverfang> @Naixoram ah mb that makes more sense. with all the leaks and new consumable info i think it is fair i mixed that up
[1:41:32] <Graxe_> Round Trip sucks in enemies, I think?
[1:41:33] <medril07> he also has the the slow dark wave
[1:41:34] <+Griffin1171> EASY MODE
[1:41:40] <%badmr7> Yes it dfoes
[1:41:42] <+imporia_> I love how easy he makes easy mode look
[1:41:44] <Graywolf_the_45th> You were doing really good before you fucked up
[1:41:51] <OkamiDude15> it sucks them in and also juggles them woopsMB
[1:41:54] <HyraFukit> You make it look a lot easier than my playthrough was.
[1:41:56] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Pat you're SO cool, DON'T FUCK IT UP!
[1:41:57] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Regular people struggle with LDK, it's fucking hard
[1:41:57] <+superkeaton> Gawd dam
[1:42:03] <SailingSaturn> We've spent an hour on Level 1-2 LUL
[1:42:07] <Ragnarok1890> I literally just finished watch Paige vs Portal, and WOOOOOOOW-AAA
[1:42:07] <+CaptainJax> jesus why does the divekick launch
[1:42:10] <bagheadlive> @AngriestPat to be fair you did make DMC3 look easy, it took me 22 hours + to beat it my first time a week ago
[1:42:18] <stropbopadopolis> the old sound effects Kreygasm
[1:42:19] <medril07> the question is who's doing all the stitching for these demons?
[1:42:21] <Naixoram> @AngriestPat Triangle + Circle with Beowulf does Kick 13
[1:42:23] <zal_silverfang> @Breakfast_Megapowers You are God DAMN right. now all we need is for them to make a true sequel to Okami and make the final Viewtiful Joe game and they would be true Platinum
[1:42:25] <IShadowStrykerI> yeah im pretty sure distortion still exists
[1:42:34] <TheGershon> You're not even on Turbo mode
[1:42:36] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Pat get motivated and give Paige a Nero
[1:42:40] <TheGershon> Right>?
[1:42:46] <IShadowStrykerI> so yeah pat look cooler
[1:42:55] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Viewtiful Joe 4 SMA5H
[1:42:56] <+CaptainJax> pat turn on turbo mode
[1:42:59] <OkamiDude15> turbo mode really jacks up timing on tohse perfect judgment cuts woopsMB
[1:43:00] <gyrogogozeppeli> did Pat ever do that FotNS stream?
[1:43:01] <Graxe_> Vergil gets some really stupid stuff like chaining Lunar Phase into Lunar Phase by teleport canceling between each one.
[1:43:05] <$Sayie> At least play turbo mode
[1:43:08] <+imextremelymanly> now you are too powerful where enemies die to fast
[1:43:13] <helpmeimafruit> Would it be weird to make Dante's theme just Lock & Load again since Nero got a completely original theme?
[1:43:19] <yarazunoamezzz> i was gone for a moment, did pat put the game on normal, why?
[1:43:20] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Fuck it, GODHAND for SMA5H
[1:43:21] <$RaikenTB> Did Vergil steal Nero's arm to please his girlfriend?
[1:43:25] <knomad2b> turbo mode sucks. the games feel off
[1:43:26] <Naixoram> would be better than subhuman lol @helpmeimafruit
[1:43:29] <Phoenon> 2l8
[1:43:31] <SWFanatic> *whistles* I love it
[1:43:53] <SWFanatic> Granny Smacker for Summer Slam
[1:43:54] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> I was about to type bayo for smash before I realized that that already fucking happened
[1:43:54] <bagheadlive> someone farting into an amp would be better then subhuman
[1:43:56] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> I'm drunk
[1:44:15] <Phoenon> Maybe next Spiral Swords that rotate around Vergil would be a good investment
[1:44:16] <+CaptainJax> @AngriestPat play with turbo turned on
[1:44:25] <+imextremelymanly> I think you can charge into million stabs too
[1:44:25] <%Agami23> what about the crazy super slash?
[1:44:33] <%LymanAl> @schlomogoldbergsteinowitz your name is drunk
[1:44:37] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @yarazunoamezzz He is TOO good to play regular mode
[1:44:40] <%RogueInfinity> Turbo MAN MODE
[1:44:42] <cherubsanonymous> Cowaaaaard
[1:44:43] <XdaXcaptainX> i hope unlocking EZ mode in DMC5 comes with its own fanfare and an AMV of Dante skipping and holding hands with marionettes
[1:44:46] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> I need to sleep, but here I am
[1:44:49] <+zaworldo> BEYO'S IN SMASH?!
[1:44:50] <TheGershon> BABY
[1:44:52] <%MrBorisMakarov> D:
[1:44:52] <+Terrabyte_The_Terrible> am I high or do some of these locations look like they're straight up ripped from Half Life 2?
[1:44:54] <helpmeimafruit> hot takes
[1:44:55] <Djinnazz> CPWARD.
[1:44:56] <medril07> he used to do it then he saw dante do it and he was like foolishness dante
[1:44:59] <troxcree> I really gotta finish this once I'm done with Lost Paradise.
[1:45:00] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> You coward
[1:45:00] <Estuko> NotLikeThis played DMC3 SE w/ turbo turned on thinking it was "a super cool mode" as a teen
[1:45:00] <+imextremelymanly> but you cant do all the crazy moves then
[1:45:01] <Djinnazz> COWARD.
[1:45:02] <Sacksquatch> Boom double turbo mode
[1:45:03] <gyrogogozeppeli> Coward
[1:45:03] <+imporia_> that's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard
[1:45:03] <OkamiDude15> @Agami23 you mean judgment cut end? its only with max concentration and if your in DT
[1:45:04] <DXLelouch24> CRAZY TALK ACTIVATE
[1:45:05] <Graxe_> Spiral Swords is always worth the investment. Vergil's playstyle is all about oppresive rushdown and overpowering opponents.
[1:45:05] <SailingSaturn> Just wait for DMC5:SE cirTan
[1:45:06] <$mandragoraroot> D:
[1:45:08] <gustavozxd> fuck off
[1:45:11] <+CaptainJax> vineMortis
[1:45:13] <gustavozxd> best way to play
[1:45:14] <DeathByPoke7> whens DMCV Hyper Fighting
[1:45:18] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Burning takes that no one will agree with
[1:45:20] <bagheadlive> yeah spiral sword is super cool
[1:45:21] <Graxe_> Spiral Swords just means he can hit you by walking into you.
[1:45:23] <$mandragoraroot> vineMortis
[1:45:23] <gyrogogozeppeli> Always with the coward takes on everything
[1:45:26] <gustavozxd> the faster the better
[1:45:27] <+imporia_> I hope they have an option to double the speed of the game
[1:45:27] <DemonicCipher> @AngriestPat Turbo mode will be the normal mode in DMC5
[1:45:28] <knomad2b> nice dodge
[1:45:28] <+khalcipher> mahOof
[1:45:29] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> If they take out turbo mode, how will we jack off to all those sick combo videos?
[1:45:34] <OkamiDude15> i cant believe itsuno is watching the stream and is making turbo mode the default setting in dmc5 woopsMB
[1:45:34] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Put EVERY Platinum or Clover character into SMA5H also Travis Touchdown
[1:45:37] <Fujiwara_92> so cool PogChamp
[1:45:42] <DXLelouch24> DOnguris gonna cut you Pat
[1:45:45] <+CaptainJax> vergil is ez mode in 4
[1:45:48] <helpmeimafruit> How much would you pay for a DLC campaign in DMC5 where you play as DMC2 Dante fighting Lucifer alongside Demifiend
[1:46:07] <%Afterman_> can i get the dmc4 lucifer wep
[1:46:08] <tank7013> If that was true it would make turbo way better in 5 though, since that's what the game would be balanced around
[1:46:21] <DXLelouch24> i masterd Perfect JC on Turbo, your a coward
[1:46:22] <DSD24> Hi Pat! Hi everyone!
[1:46:24] <gustavozxd> @helpmeimafruit you said lucifer i was almost gonna say i'd pay for that to not happen
[1:46:26] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> stayhyBottle Welcome to SHBv5: Mod+ can now type !emotehydrate to toggle emote mode when sending hydration reminders. Also your settings may now be changed from my chat while you are offline.
[1:46:26] <LiquidMathew> I like Gilgamesh's mask
[1:46:28] <bagheadlive> still surprised they haven't put out some retelling of DMC2, like a CGI movie or light novel or a sketch, anything
[1:46:28] <%Afterman_> that would affect it @helpmeimafruit
[1:46:28] <fairore> @helpmeimafruit 60
[1:46:29] <admiral_of_crunch> Ooh shit, dmc
[1:46:32] <SailingSaturn> @DSD24 cirHi
[1:46:34] <Splatterfest> Games preety kool mang
[1:46:35] <HyraFukit> @helpmeimafruit Ill pay 15 if it gets demifiend in dmc5
[1:46:36] <XdaXcaptainX> purely aesthetically Beowulf is easily the best
[1:46:37] <Djinnazz> Balrog IS beowulf, plus kicks.
[1:46:41] <+imextremelymanly> Scum
[1:46:41] <Estuko> Kreygasm
[1:46:42] <gmarchant> Hey Pat at full concentration you get another charge on Beowulf
[1:46:46] <OkamiDude15> hydrate bot woopsHappy
[1:46:50] <%Dr_FoxWolf> Yo WHERES THE DISTORTION
[1:46:51] <+khalcipher> Kreygasm
[1:46:53] <TechDragon_Z> Ah. So that's the orgasm button.
[1:46:54] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Balrog gives you sick fucking dempsey rolls, it's pretty hard to beat
[1:46:56] <Fujiwara_92> Kreygasm
[1:46:58] <$mandragoraroot> YEEEEAH
[1:46:59] <+IAmSkeleton> omae wa
[1:46:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> We need another Anarchy Reigns with the entire Platinum roster. INCLUDING Ammy
[1:47:07] <+imporia_> that attack looks so dumb
[1:47:09] <Estuko> @Breakfast_Megapowers please I'll cry
[1:47:10] <rytisone> consume hydrogen dioxide
[1:47:13] <Graxe_> It's much better on LDK mode because you see like 20 enemies freeze and die.
[1:47:15] <%deviljhojho94> !uptime
[1:47:15] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 47m 16s.
[1:47:19] <DXLelouch24> Pat do Distorted Real Impact
[1:47:20] <TheGershon> Man the sound design is so fucking excellent
[1:47:22] <%badmr7> 3rd level charge with beo with full meter
[1:47:23] <DXLelouch24> DO IT
[1:47:25] <admiral_of_crunch> Hey chat, anyone know Pat's stance on No-Item/No-Continue DMD runs? On DMC3 specifically?
[1:47:26] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Estuko Cry for your DREAMS
[1:47:27] <bagheadlive> @Breakfast_Megapowers do you mean Amy from the smash hit PS3 survival horror game, Amy?
[1:47:28] <+imporia_> just running around windmilliing swords around
[1:47:30] <+nolifegamin> oh shit Pat playing DMC4 PogChamp
[1:47:30] <%SaltyDongs> sad
[1:47:37] <Vorsun> I would love Balrog with Gilgamesh's visual aesthetic
[1:47:39] <helpmeimafruit> honestly if the SMT Nocturne remake does happen and it's only Raidou instead of Dante as the guest I'll be super sad even though Raidou is dope
[1:47:40] <admiral_of_crunch> Because holy shit is that an ordeal
[1:47:40] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @bagheadlive Yes exactly
[1:47:41] <Estuko> @Breakfast_Megapowers crying so hard for my dreams
[1:47:42] <%Big_Dream> is he playing vergil instead of nero ???
[1:47:43] <gustavozxd> Gilgamesh looks cool but i feel like it's the worst fisting weapon in the series
[1:47:44] <%Afterman_> god i hate these parts
[1:47:45] <gyrogogozeppeli> Easy Mode always available for Pat
[1:47:50] <DSD24> Is Vergil Concentrated right now?
[1:47:54] <$mandragoraroot> DO A DRI ON THE BOSS
[1:47:57] <%Afterman_> with the jumping from ball to ball
[1:47:58] <bagheadlive> @Breakfast_Megapowers :thumps_up:
[1:48:00] <gustavozxd> these guys are pretty easy
[1:48:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> DRI is Dante
[1:48:14] <+CaptainJax> DO IT COWARD
[1:48:17] <IShadowStrykerI> distort the shoryuken
[1:48:25] <IShadowStrykerI> it still works
[1:48:25] <Estuko> beware his flaming horse dong, he might slap you with it
[1:48:26] <$mandragoraroot> FeelsBadMan
[1:48:27] <+imextremelymanly> you can totally do it
[1:48:28] <gmarchant> Try doing the 4th charge on rising dragon with full concentration, it literally sends them fucking flying
[1:48:29] <TheBlankAce> Its the first boss in a dmc game
[1:48:29] <gustavozxd> he fucking blocks judgement cut end
[1:48:33] <jacknerik> DRI! DRI! DRI!
[1:48:38] <+imporia_> DO IT NOW
[1:48:39] <DXLelouch24> DIstort the Shoryu
[1:48:41] <Mattmandx1> The game auto locks to bosses anyway
[1:48:42] <mojomoud> I thnk the reason I don't like the way Balrog looks is because it's default attack animation looks like a punch of babby jabs as opposed to actual punches
[1:48:42] <OkamiDude15> DO IT
[1:48:43] <DXLelouch24> you can do DRI
[1:48:44] <+imporia_> 3 CHARGES
[1:48:45] <+imextremelymanly> get back pat
[1:48:46] <tank7013> Jaysus that damage
[1:48:50] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Being able to knock up those combo dummies makes them so much better. I forgot how much I enjoyed dmc4
[1:49:01] <+tnomads> Vergil's combos were made to be weapon switched mid combo IMO. I constantly cycle between the 3
[1:49:02] <gustavozxd> THIS.FUCKING.MOVE
[1:49:07] <gustavozxd> oh my god fuck this move
[1:49:10] <%KaizenChaos> DT block
[1:49:17] <Naixoram> use Trick to dodge the AOE
[1:49:18] <Djinnazz> teleport through it.
[1:49:20] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Vergil is only as cool as his dumb car
[1:49:20] <Phoenon> @AngriestPat If you're in DT you can vanish backwards
[1:49:22] <rytisone> run back?
[1:49:24] <+imextremelymanly> stand still for max damage
[1:49:27] <DXLelouch24> Trick has i frames Pat
[1:49:28] <+Terrabyte_The_Terrible> They should add this guy into Monster Hunter World
[1:49:30] <EBT93> Air trick
[1:49:33] <+GuelermeDias> did pat unlock easy mode already?
[1:49:33] <%badmr7> teleport to dodge
[1:49:46] <jacknerik> DRI you coward
[1:49:50] <%badmr7> sword swings
[1:49:51] <+nolifegamin> use your motivation to dodge
[1:49:54] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> No but stand still though
[1:49:56] <gustavozxd> @terrabyte_the_terrible i'd prefer an actual good dmc boss fight
[1:49:56] <helpmeimafruit> DmC Vergil is fucking hilarious to me and I love him despite everything
[1:49:56] <Graxe_> Oh right, DT has a back dash.
[1:49:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> They should add Tony Hawk to MHW
[1:50:03] <$mandragoraroot> is the dt burst thing in 4 too?
[1:50:05] <mojomoud> I don't know why, but Devl May Cry bosses in Monster Hunter would be both the dumbest and greatest thing ever
[1:50:05] <+SuichiTanaka> They'd have to actually make a new skeleton to put him in MHW
[1:50:06] <+Terrabyte_The_Terrible> lmao true
[1:50:07] <Magnetgear> is pat fucking up again?
[1:50:07] <+imextremelymanly> yep just teleport if you want to get closer or dodge
[1:50:09] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> When is the vergilmobile dlc
[1:50:10] <Graxe_> And in the air, it brings him to the ground.
[1:50:10] <EBT93> You can jump back to avoid it
[1:50:17] <BlitzChocula> finish him with a judgement cut!
[1:50:18] <+tnomads> I think Vergil has table hopper in DT in this but i could be wrong
[1:50:22] <+BlvckDoom> @AngriestPat does anybody else like playing with lighters cause im doing that right now
[1:50:23] <+GuelermeDias> kill tony hawk 100 times to craft a 900
[1:50:25] <mojomoud> @Magnetgear When isn't Pat fucking up?
[1:50:26] <+razielhex> what the hell is eveen the plot of this game?
[1:50:26] <DSD24> Air Stinger is so cool
[1:50:26] <Naixoram> he does @tnomads
[1:50:29] <gustavozxd> this boss has so many annoying moves
[1:50:40] <rytisone> without upgrades he would've killed you
[1:50:41] <%badmr7> he does
[1:50:42] <DSD24> @razielhex This is non canon
[1:50:42] <DXLelouch24> you can do DRI with Vergil, just use the Shoryu
[1:50:44] <helpmeimafruit> BURN TO THE GROUND
[1:50:45] <Rngiddion> he looks dope tho
[1:50:45] <admiral_of_crunch> @angriestpat Unless chat's already asked, what is your most impressive DMC-related achievement? How hardcore is your nerd cred?
[1:50:46] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I want the Cavalier moveset but I want the VergilMobile instead
[1:50:46] <+Terrabyte_The_Terrible> Burning stuff is rad
[1:50:47] <gustavozxd> not a difficult boss, but really annoying
[1:50:49] <+tnomads> you're basically casting a small spell when you use a lighter
[1:50:50] <knomad2b> i burn shit more than i should
[1:50:51] <+CaptainJax> @razielhex Vergil's campaign has no story, you just play the levels
[1:50:52] <OkamiDude15> didnt we talk about this on the podcast a while back? woopsThink
[1:50:52] <%ssjklyco> Don't be woolie
[1:50:52] <element_of_loyalty> BURNT TO THE GROUND
[1:50:53] <+Raymanguy13> Burning stuff is sweet
[1:50:54] <bagheadlive> @razielhex Vergil's campaign doesn't have one
[1:50:55] <+imextremelymanly> you still into burning stuff
[1:50:56] <%xemnahort> @razielhex you on,y get plot in the Nero/Dante mode
[1:50:57] <Mattmandx1> Burning stuff is cool but impractical
[1:50:57] <IShadowStrykerI> darn now he cant distort the shoryu
[1:50:58] <jacknerik> SBA
[1:50:59] <+Bupkis7> I do
[1:51:00] <DSD24> A for Awesome
[1:51:01] <$mandragoraroot> BURN TO THE GROU D
[1:51:01] <Fujiwara_92> BURN IS COOL
[1:51:01] <$BeardedLuchador> Fire Stream \o/
[1:51:02] <knomad2b> just burn paper
[1:51:02] <+Bupkis7> Yes
[1:51:02] <Magnetgear> @mojomoud when he isnt touching a controller
[1:51:03] <+Griffin1171> That's it, I'm taking out my lighter
[1:51:06] <DeathByPoke7> is there a dmc weapon that is a giant lighter
[1:51:06] <sosuke5> BURNING
[1:51:07] <+intothfanfiction> no flames can kill you
[1:51:08] <+razielhex> But what's the *PLOT* of it anyway!?
[1:51:08] <TechDragon_Z> PYRO MANIA
[1:51:09] <bagheadlive> @AngriestPat what are you Jake Paul? #relevant
[1:51:10] <Djinnazz> oh wow, they took out dmg as a end game stat.
[1:51:10] <+shambambammina> If you weren't meant to burn stuff, then why is it flammable?
[1:51:10] <cherubsanonymous> Y AIN'T YOU ON CAMERA PAIGE
[1:51:10] <TerraWraith> I saw a leprechaun. He told me to burn things.
[1:51:10] <Fujiwara_92> BURN TO THE GROUND
[1:51:11] <+GuelermeDias> BWANING
[1:51:13] <$RaikenTB> Lighters are sick. You can use them to defeat big boss.
[1:51:13] <%KaizenChaos> PowerUpL LUL PowerUpR
[1:51:15] <SuperSaiyanSora> shotoBrrrt TO THE GROUND
[1:51:16] <DXLelouch24> Pat you can do DRI with Vergil, just Distort his Shoryu
[1:51:18] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Follow Flame Hynyard's plan everybody
[1:51:18] <+tnomads> Vergil feels way stronger then Dante and Nero in this
[1:51:19] <mojomoud> GET AIR HIKE
[1:51:19] <+imporia_> matches >>>>> lighters
[1:51:20] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> half my job is burning stuff pat
[1:51:21] <TerraWraith> I saw a leprechaun. He told me to burn things. And his name was Pat
[1:51:22] <rytisone> Paige is summoning Berial
[1:51:23] <LiquidMathew> They are Vergil's vacation photos
[1:51:23] <%SneakTheBeak> apatFist apatSmug
[1:51:24] <+khalcipher> oh boy now i need to burn something
[1:51:28] <Mattmandx1> This chapter is long and annoying
[1:51:29] <medril07> you're in this castle for so fucking long
[1:51:29] <+GreenJudgement> @AngriestPat yo Pat, you mighta said already but what's your take on Obsidian maybe being bought by Microsoft?
[1:51:29] <jacknerik> @KaizenChaos How the fuck do you have 3 hands
[1:51:33] <+GuelermeDias> buy air hike pat
[1:51:37] <%badmr7> nuetral trick is air hike
[1:51:38] <helpmeimafruit> vergil's too cool for double jumps
[1:51:38] <+Griffin1171> I have a lighter that uses a plasma arc
[1:51:39] <knomad2b> here i go burning again
[1:51:41] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> @AngriestPat Why is paige offscreen, does she have her feet out or something?
[1:51:45] <OkamiDude15> @AngriestPat is there any way to play p4 golden without a vita or pstv?
[1:51:46] <gustavozxd> photo mode better have selfies in dmcv
[1:51:48] <%Spydurman> rumor
[1:51:48] <jacknerik> wait WHAT
[1:51:51] <SailingSaturn> still a rumor
[1:51:52] <DSD24> Wait what?
[1:51:54] <$BeardedLuchador> rumor
[1:51:54] <Rngiddion> rumor still
[1:51:55] <mojomoud> I haven't played as Vergl in this yet, so I didn't know he had no Air hike
[1:51:56] <+GreenJudgement> @AngriestPat rumor
[1:51:56] <+tnomads> the level design in this game is so questionable
[1:51:57] <TechDragon_Z> Maybe they can make New Vegas 2 on Xbone...
[1:51:58] <Fujiwara_92> rumor
[1:51:59] <+shawntk_> @SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz She's gregnant
[1:51:59] <+khalcipher> obsidian isnt even what it used to be
[1:52:01] <+galvanicpanic821> how do we know paige is really there and pat didnt pull a Kira thing and just has paiges hand off to the side
[1:52:01] <$Sayie> From what I said they are finalising the deal but idk
[1:52:04] <TheBlankAce> It's still a rumor but its like a 90% done deal
[1:52:05] <+XIR0> I hope that's just a rumor, it sounds like a terrible idea
[1:52:06] <knomad2b> wait the pillars guys?
[1:52:12] <DemonicCipher> Maybe a rumor but it seems pretty damn credible
[1:52:12] <DracaenaLeaf> Yeah
[1:52:15] <DXLelouch24> PAT DO DRI with the Shoryu, its possible
[1:52:17] <+imporia_> lighters are pure convenience, but matches are more satisfying to light, have a more pleasant flame, and smell really nice
[1:52:17] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Finally Xbox will have 1 IP I care about
[1:52:19] <EBT93> Use trick up to double jump
[1:52:20] <+GuelermeDias> pat would've lkept paige's foot
[1:52:22] <gmarchant> Gonna say this one more time then give up, but try getting full concentration then charging Beowulf moves longer, it's really cool
[1:52:22] <Graywolf_the_45th> Can't wait to play the no games by obsidion in the future with their new partnership with micriosoft
[1:52:23] <arkv01> surrennder your booty now
[1:52:25] <+GuelermeDias> if he were to kira her
[1:52:26] <medril07> Pat do you want to see V's fighting style or wait til the game to see it?
[1:52:28] <bagheadlive> @OkamiDude15 Unless there are vita emulators that run stable but I'd be surprised if there were
[1:52:30] <DSD24> Scum
[1:52:34] <jacknerik> so red orbs are mined, not carved?
[1:52:35] <%Spydurman> I feel like if they get bought they're gonna get Scalebounded but with their finances it's fucking tough to say no to taking that risk
[1:52:35] <%xemnahort> As much as I don’t like the idea maybe the xbone could have games finally
[1:52:37] <HoIlywood_SN> Obsidian will never make something like New Vegas again so i am completely indifferent
[1:52:42] <$BeardedLuchador> @GuelermeDias not true, it's all about the tiny hat Kappa
[1:52:42] <%KaizenChaos> @jacknerik Internet
[1:52:47] <mojomoud> but playing through this with Dante and nero reminds me that Nero feels mor elike a proof of concept than an actual playable character
[1:52:47] <arkv01> foolishness mother
[1:52:57] <cptbellybutton352> did you know 4 out of 5 pats are always wrong??? the more you know..
[1:52:59] <rytisone> so this where Las Plagas was excavated...
[1:53:00] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> @medril07 I'm going to assume the former because pat seems to strive on spoilers
[1:53:00] <XdaXcaptainX> has microsoft EVER bought anybody and then made something worthwhile with them?
[1:53:01] <+khalcipher> @HoIlywood_SN exactly
[1:53:04] <42nfl19> A bit late but did Pat mention why he not doing DMC 3 Vergil? Hasn't unlocked it yet?
[1:53:08] <seniorwhiteface> If Ive been stuck at Mission for the past 4 months does that mean I'm bad at the Devil May Cry's?
[1:53:10] <$mandragoraroot> d i e
[1:53:14] <mojomoud> He has practically NOTHING compared to Dante
[1:53:17] <gyrogogozeppeli> It will kill studios you love as a joke
[1:53:17] <TheyCallMeVawn> Obsidian is the next Rare
[1:53:18] <OkamiDude15> @bagheadlive guess ill stick to playing it on pcsx then
[1:53:19] <$RaikenTB> they almost kiilled Platinum NotLikeThis
[1:53:20] <+kukadin> I just walked in on some harsh truths
[1:53:21] <seniorwhiteface> Mission 5
[1:53:21] <+razielhex> Microsoft is a lot bigger than EA though
[1:53:21] <Donchalant402> so im not the only one who hates these
[1:53:25] <+tnomads> platforming on turbo mode in this game is STUPID
[1:53:25] <+edited156> Isn't Microsoft literally bigger than EA
[1:53:28] <+imextremelymanly> its not good news.
[1:53:28] <Grennold> Can't wait for Uncle Phil to kill a few more studios LuL
[1:53:29] <Mattmandx1> Vergil was not designed for those orbs
[1:53:30] <+LogothX> EA killed respawn. As a joke. I fucking love Titanfall too.
[1:53:35] <+RushUnplugged> I'm already sad about ninjatheory getting bought, now Obsidian too
[1:53:39] <+Raymanguy13> Microsoft is the second worst
[1:53:39] <nekodelic> who's gonna be bought by Microsoft?
[1:53:41] <gustavozxd> you just mash what are you talking about pat LUL
[1:53:44] <+RenoDeGeneric> @AngriestPat is Blitz the worst enemy in DMC?
[1:53:47] <+GreenJudgement> @AngriestPat I'm with ya buddy, although not cuz I don't like Microsoft, I just don't see a possibly obsidian consumer benefit
[1:53:48] <TheGershon> Are there even people left at Obsidian who really matter anymore
[1:53:48] <%xemnahort> @seniorwhiteface no it just means your approach is flawed
[1:53:51] <%aishman> @AngriestPat It super sucks too because of what they had to do so Bethesda didn't buy them after NV. For Microsoft to come and buy them just feels wrong.
[1:53:52] <%superorangerobin> Microsoft is like "We need new studios so we can cancel more games"
[1:53:56] <TheGershon> I thought the big creatives all left
[1:53:58] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> @edited156 Microsoft is much bigger than EA, but their games department isn't
[1:53:59] <TheBlankAce> It's a shame all that backroom stuff happened at Obsidian, thats probably why they're doing it
[1:54:00] <SuperSaiyanSora> FuckEA
[1:54:02] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @TheGershon J.E. Sawyer is still there
[1:54:06] <%xemnahort> @seniorwhiteface or you need more upgrades
[1:54:08] <gustavozxd> if blitz comes back i'm going after itsuno
[1:54:10] <bagheadlive> @OkamiDude15 yeah golden was specifically a vita exclusive so all the extra content is in that version only, it must of been some deal sony had with atlas
[1:54:10] <+RushUnplugged> they're gonna make 1-2 xbone/windows store exclusive games that DON'T sell, and they get closed
[1:54:13] <OkamiDude15> @AngriestPat you can trick/teleport cancel out of basically every move
[1:54:18] <Crankthulhu> Did Obsidian make Wasteland 2?
[1:54:18] <mojomoud> Also, them not letting Vergil use Yamato as an actual weapon in game is a missed opportunity
[1:54:20] <helpmeimafruit> Todd Coward
[1:54:22] <+tnomads> oh gosh i forgot about that metaacritic debacle
[1:54:28] <$BeardedLuchador> there's a story reason tho
[1:54:29] <+kukadin> Wait what's oing on?
[1:54:30] <+guykazamatankbuster> i got work in a few hours so good night ya'll
[1:54:34] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> What if Microsoft bought Telltale
[1:54:36] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> It's a shame PoE2 wasn't all that good,
[1:54:38] <%MrBorisMakarov> same tbh
[1:54:38] <knomad2b> same
[1:54:39] <+imextremelymanly> gotta use that hat
[1:54:40] <arkv01> seems like devs are taking dicks left and right like a sushi buffet these days
[1:54:41] <DSD24> Moon looks nice
[1:54:42] <42nfl19> So no why no dmc3 vergil? not unlocked yet?
[1:54:42] <HoIlywood_SN> "right afterwards" its been like 7 years
[1:54:43] <rytisone> time for cool anime screen shots
[1:54:46] <Rngiddion> it hurts that its 5 months away
[1:54:48] <jacknerik> Anor Londo?
[1:54:48] <%MrBorisMakarov> I've never even played DMC
[1:54:48] <$mandragoraroot> vineNut
[1:54:50] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Chris Avellone already left Obsidian so I'm not too sad tho, I didn't really play or care about pillars
[1:54:50] <HoIlywood_SN> Pat its been like 7 years since New Vegas
[1:54:51] <$BeardedLuchador> DMCV comes out my birthday month, ty papa Capcom
[1:54:51] <%Spydurman> can Devolver buy Obsidian? BibleThump
[1:54:51] <+TheImmortal70> The two most important things you can learn to do as vergil is to trick cancel EVERYTHING, and to use summoned swords to prevent knockback
[1:54:53] <knomad2b> dmc5 and re2 remake hypes real rn
[1:54:53] <%xemnahort> @breakfast_megapowers someone already bought telltale
[1:54:53] <+LeroyOctopus> @AngriestPat have you played mega man 11?
[1:54:54] <cherubsanonymous> Capcom's been on a killstreak lately
[1:54:54] <Mattmandx1> @mojomoud What do you mean? He's using it right now
[1:54:55] <TheyCallMeVawn> DMCV honestly looks like its going to be one of the best games Ill have ever played
[1:54:55] <medril07> that's why I'm playing DMC4 too
[1:54:59] <EBT93> BANG BANG BANG
[1:54:59] <TheyCallMeVawn> RE2 looks great too
[1:54:59] <IminyourBase> i hope DMC5 has an easy mode
[1:54:59] <+tnomads> it feels like it's coming out so soon but it's not till march
[1:55:02] <arkv01> im excited too pat, thats why im only in my pants
[1:55:06] <DSD24> Especially since Fallout 76 looks like a game
[1:55:08] <+imextremelymanly> It has multiplayer I hear
[1:55:09] <arkv01> clearly you aren't excitted enough to remove your shirt
[1:55:09] <+TheImmortal70> Yaaaaay a core enemy in the game is not only fast, but has armor
[1:55:09] <gustavozxd> i've never been excited for a game as i've been for dmcv
[1:55:10] <$Sayie> I find it hilarious that nobody is even considering that MS might have actually learned from their mistakes and will probably actually support the studios they bought LUL
[1:55:10] <B_ikki> new old capcom enbYesplease
[1:55:16] <bagheadlive> I wanna see V so bad
[1:55:16] <$BeardedLuchador> Am I the only one that feels like Capcom is gonna have another RE4-era of games?
[1:55:17] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @xemnahort was it me? Did I buy Telltale?
[1:55:22] <mojomoud> @Mattmandx1 I mean Nero using Yamato as a weapon, I stroked out there for a second
[1:55:22] <stropbopadopolis> is dmc4 not going on the channel?
[1:55:23] <TheyCallMeVawn> Im just worried about how V is gonna stack up compared to Nero, Dante, and the rest of the cast.
[1:55:25] <$BeardedLuchador> thanks to the MHW success
[1:55:26] <+TheImmortal70> These lizards are one of my more hated enemies in this game
[1:55:26] <gustavozxd> god i hate frosts
[1:55:27] <knomad2b> i just got the collection again to satiate my hype
[1:55:30] <%aishman> @AngriestPat I'm so excite I went ahead and re-bought Bayo for the Switch because I needed a DMC-like game and also support Bayonetta
[1:55:31] <helpmeimafruit> multiplayer Bloody Palace will be the most fun but most infuriating thing ever
[1:55:37] <HoIlywood_SN> @TheyCallMeVawn supposedly he has demon summons
[1:55:38] <DXLelouch24> Pat do DRI with the Shoryu
[1:55:38] <BlitzChocula> really hope 5 doesn't have the crap backtracking of 4!
[1:55:42] <+Mahkulaan> @Sayie You mean like they did with Rare? LUL
[1:55:42] <IShadowStrykerI> while i want him to do a DRD, it doesnt matter unless its on the boss
[1:55:45] <+razielhex> Oh, now we're in UNdeadberg
[1:55:46] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> @Sayie Woah, now you're talking crazy guy
[1:55:48] <+TheImmortal70> Attacks have little windup or tell, and they have armor
[1:55:48] <+GuelermeDias> did v gameplay leak?
[1:55:50] <+imextremelymanly> depends on your skill level
[1:55:52] <+abluecardigan> i would very much appreciate some more monsters and maybe even a g rank, if we're gonna talk about mhw
[1:55:53] <+GuelermeDias> where can i get the scoops
[1:55:55] <gustavozxd> the have projectiles, healing, jumping, teleports and instant fucking moves
[1:55:57] <+CaptainJax> i've started playing DMD DMC3 because i'm excited for 5, IT'S FUCKING HARD
[1:55:58] <gyrogogozeppeli> what is happen
[1:56:01] <Mattmandx1> @mojomoud Ok. Yeah I would have liked to Nero to get weapon switching in general tbh, not a fan of the Red Queen
[1:56:03] <$Sayie> @Mahkulaan at least Rare still makes games
[1:56:07] <%xemnahort> @breakfast_megapowers the one who really bought telltale was the friends we made along the way
[1:56:09] <$mandragoraroot> Fat Elmo
[1:56:10] <itsya_boi_gappy> its just a fighting game mode @AngriestPat
[1:56:10] <seniorwhiteface> @xemnahort Ive bloody got the air hike and a holy water to wear the twin elemental turds but I still get stomped super hard. I know the whole fire dude being weak to curberus thing as well, but IDK.
[1:56:11] <yendoria> But pat it is Wednesday
[1:56:12] <+nolifegamin> we're used to it Pat, it's fine
[1:56:13] <EBT93> @blitzchocula I doubt it will have it. DMC5’s actually been given time
[1:56:13] <rytisone> PvP would be like Dark Souls levels of laggy
[1:56:14] <%ssjklyco> its wednesday for you now
[1:56:14] <jacknerik> It's Wednesday now pat
[1:56:15] <SirAlan76> do you imagine if nevan returns in dmc5 with different modes like Cerberus
[1:56:17] <%Dr_FoxWolf> Yo is this Anor Londo?
[1:56:20] <DSD24> BREAKDOWN
[1:56:21] <$eddi401> We got Pat staying up, on a Tuesday
[1:56:24] <+razielhex> It's Wednesday, my dudes
[1:56:26] <SWFanatic> The baby
[1:56:26] <+imextremelymanly> ninja gaiden multiplayer was the same thing. If you sucked you pulled people down too
[1:56:27] <+Yeajow> I hope the whole DLC thing being blown out of proportion isn't too bad on dmc5
[1:56:27] <+razielhex> REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[1:56:30] <+Maids4lyfe> this is totally anor londo
[1:56:30] <+RushUnplugged> suits don't learn, if a game doesn't sell it's everyone else's fault, and they cut losses
[1:56:30] <gustavozxd> trumpet mode for nevan lets go
[1:56:31] <SWFanatic> Happy baby
[1:56:31] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> It sucks that Nero only has the one weapon, but I'm glad I really like red queen's gimmick
[1:56:31] <awsomesaucekirby> *Wednesday
[1:56:34] <+TheImmortal70> If nevan returns and just takes up both your gun slot and your attack slot I'd be fine with it
[1:56:36] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @AngriestPat Will you be able to Invade someone Souls-style in the new DMC?
[1:56:36] <OkamiDude15> @stropbopadopolis it most likely will be on the channel after 3
[1:56:38] <knomad2b> pvp would be weird, i'd rather have co-op missions and bp
[1:56:39] <gyrogogozeppeli> Jojo night is close
[1:56:39] <+TheImmortal70> I WANT to have a scythe
[1:56:42] <gyrogogozeppeli> Part 5 OP soon
[1:56:43] <helpmeimafruit> oh boy the gyros
[1:56:49] <medril07> I hate the dmc hd collection
[1:56:50] <Mattmandx1> I wonder if they'll bring Lucia back
[1:56:53] <arkv01> i meaan nero's got multiple dildo arms now
[1:56:56] <%xemnahort> @seniorwhiteface what style?
[1:56:58] <arkv01> he'll be okay
[1:56:58] <awsomesaucekirby> the lick should have been LONGER
[1:57:01] <gustavozxd> red queen is godlike
[1:57:01] <SWFanatic> Elmo bath time
[1:57:03] <rytisone> and Sweet Surrender
[1:57:03] <%CommanderRab> I stopped watching the shitstorm to watch this.
[1:57:05] <+GuelermeDias> Nero has the best sword, the best gun and the best arm
[1:57:07] <TerraWraith> Red Queen only carries the weapon, Nero
[1:57:09] <+TheImmortal70> Think of it this way: Nero has one weapon, meaning he has a moveset that is already built up that can be modified and EXPANDED
[1:57:12] <BlitzChocula> elmo's grooming himself.
[1:57:12] <gustavozxd> and now nero has all the new breakers
[1:57:16] <knomad2b> i personally like Cerberus the most
[1:57:16] <OkamiDude15> nero is a really good weapon for red queen to have i agree
[1:57:19] <EBT93> Ehhhh
[1:57:20] <$mandragoraroot> Nero is a cool weapon yeah
[1:57:20] <cptbellybutton352> ELMO BEEP BEEP!
[1:57:20] <+tnomads> getting a full charge by perfectly timing the R2 after a hit is the BEST
[1:57:20] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @CommanderRab Welcome to the REAL Shitstorm
[1:57:23] <arkv01> nero can please any woman now
[1:57:25] <arkv01> even mother
[1:57:26] <gustavozxd> blue rose is good too, that charge shot is amazing
[1:57:27] <StrawberryPantsu> Cerberus is the best though
[1:57:30] <+GreenJudgement> @AngriestPat Aight Pat, I know DMC V is hype, but tell me you're hype for Soul Calibur VI tho
[1:57:30] <DXLelouch24> the best weapon and the series but cant do Distorted Real Impact
[1:57:30] <medril07> they solidified dante's fringe so half the time you can't see his eyes
[1:57:31] <Mattmandx1> Red Queen is annoying to control in my opinion. Revving it up just takes too long and perfect revs or hard to do
[1:57:32] <helpmeimafruit> woo
[1:57:32] <beastman309> Did Pat ever finish Zeta Gundam? Know he hasen't finished early UC.
[1:57:33] <$Sayie> The fact that Nero has a really awesome grapple attack sells me on him being my favorite
[1:57:35] <Frozenflame01> hopefully the people who over reacted to the microtransaction in DMC5 I'll still buy it
[1:57:37] <+GuelermeDias> Charge Shot is fuckin' busted.
[1:57:41] <%CommanderRab> PLayed some of this earlier, got to frog boss, game froze and had to restart. hadn't saved in 3 hours....
[1:57:42] <Fujiwara_92> Nero is a good weapon
[1:57:45] <EBT93> I prefer Cerberus and Agni & Rudra
[1:57:49] <%Superstarsage> oh lawd i'm coming
[1:57:50] <+TheImmortal70> There is a fuckin HAT that gives FREE ORBS
[1:57:51] <arkv01> goddamn vergil is cool
[1:57:52] <helpmeimafruit> final devil breaker unlock: The God Hand
[1:57:59] <+imextremelymanly> Nero gun actually does damage
[1:58:01] <OkamiDude15> YOU SHALL KNOW THIS DEVIL'S POWER PowerUpL woopsS PowerUpR
[1:58:01] <+TheImmortal70> You don't need microtransactions at ALL
[1:58:02] <StrawberryPantsu> @EBT93 Gets it
[1:58:02] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> There's so many hype ass sword games coming out
[1:58:03] <42nfl19> I mean technically Pat, nero will get two sidearms. megabuster and Blue Rose.
[1:58:03] <mojomoud> I REALLY hope they go more in-depth with the grappling that Nero can do
[1:58:07] <knomad2b> the new punchy weapon looks so damn cool tho
[1:58:08] <arkv01> foolishness pat
[1:58:08] <+Yeajow> optimal red queen play feels so tiring to me
[1:58:08] <bagheadlive> @CommanderRab what version? DMC4SE on PS4 is all autosaves
[1:58:10] <+nolifegamin> It's Vergil, everything should hit
[1:58:10] <%StrangeWords> @AngriestPat Reminder that Concentration also massively increases the range of all of Yamato's attack
[1:58:10] <%Hilleltaco> I think it did because of maxed concentration
[1:58:12] <helpmeimafruit> LUL
[1:58:12] <%badmr7> That is the METER
[1:58:14] <TurtlesAndTentacles> eh
[1:58:17] <Graxe_> Don't you know that Vergil's power is absolute?
[1:58:17] <%StrangeWords> s
[1:58:17] <TheBlankAce> Since Cerberus is back do you think that Dante just threw Agni and Rudra in a closet and forgot about them?
[1:58:17] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat That's max concentration for you.
[1:58:26] <%CommanderRab> normal ass verson on PC
[1:58:28] <+imextremelymanly> to impatient pat
[1:58:29] <%Big_Dream> is the hd remake of 4
[1:58:31] <+Maids4lyfe> what does the focus meter even do?
[1:58:31] <$mandragoraroot> oh no not this room m6kwLukeno
[1:58:32] <rumuloh> Worst room in the series right here.
[1:58:32] <+GuelermeDias> ah, this room
[1:58:34] <%xemnahort> @seniorwhiteface what style are you using?
[1:58:43] <mojomoud> @TheBlankAce Wouldn't surprise me if he had a clost ful of weapons he just forgets about
[1:58:44] <cptbellybutton352> glassDangit
[1:58:44] <+GuelermeDias> please let pat fuck up a couple more times
[1:58:45] <+TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Max concentration modifies moves: Yamato gets longer reach, Force Edge has multiple hits, and Beowulf fuckin HURTS
[1:58:49] <+GuelermeDias> better yet make paige do it
[1:58:50] <+nolifegamin> @Maids4lyfe it makes Vergil motivated
[1:58:50] <Mattmandx1> @TheBlankAce Yes. They talked too much
[1:58:51] <arkv01> they just gave vergil beowulf before he actually gets it in dmc3 for gameplay purposes right
[1:58:54] <rumuloh> Genuinly had more trouble with this than any other level in the game
[1:58:56] <bagheadlive> @CommanderRab ahh, bummer, didn't remember how the original version worked
[1:58:59] <XdaXcaptainX> how far into DMC5 do you think we'll have to get before retrieving the original devil bringer?
[1:58:59] <OkamiDude15> @Big_Dream special edition on ps4 because the pc port is trash
[1:59:06] <+Maids4lyfe> @nolifegamin amazing
[1:59:07] <helpmeimafruit> my sister walked in on me watching JoJo Part 5 right when Giorno gets licked and just left without saying a word, do you think she got the wrong idea
[1:59:11] <gustavozxd> that taunt hits and It's great
[1:59:15] <seniorwhiteface> @xemnahort Trickster lv2
[1:59:16] <+Yeajow> @maids4lyfe it ups damage and gives some moves extra stuff
[1:59:17] <EBT93> I really loved Dante’s battle calls in DMC3. The always get me hyped. “IT’S COOL!” Being my favorite
[1:59:22] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat When you're doing a tap move, try to tap with the shoot button, it will greatly increse damage and style points!
[1:59:29] <arkv01> dabb slayer
[1:59:29] <Mattmandx1> Fuck this part as Vergil
[1:59:30] <+imextremelymanly> you good
[1:59:31] <$RaikenTB> LUL
[1:59:32] <+Maids4lyfe> @Yeajow ah okay thank you
[1:59:33] <%xemnahort> @seniorwhiteface are you separating them?
[1:59:35] <awsomesaucekirby> Is Pucchi's hymn chorus "DIOs Vult"?
[1:59:39] <+TheImmortal70> @helpmeimafruit You have to now go up to her, and explain to her that what you were watching was EXACTLY what it seemed like
[1:59:45] <+tnomads> on turbo mode that part is the wrost
[1:59:45] <+nolifegamin> @Maids4lyfe to give a real answer it basically enhances his attacks to be better as long as you only stand still/walk
[1:59:46] <rytisone> this section fucked me up so many times
[1:59:47] <knomad2b> if there's a vergil dlc in 5 i'd buy tht shit so fast, or even just a vergil moveset
[1:59:47] <bagheadlive> what if in DMC5, the one extra weapon Nero gets is his Devil Bringer so he just runs around dual weilding his robot arm and holding his old arm?
[1:59:51] <$mandragoraroot> ayyyy
[1:59:52] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:54] <OkamiDude15> on turbo mode it is next to impossible to grab those orbs as nero
[1:59:55] <seniorwhiteface> @xemnahort Ive only ever used Trickster
[2:00:00] <gustavozxd> @ebt93 dmc5 will have nero screaming "give them a little taste of the GOOD SHIT!" that's my fav now, goddamn
[2:00:01] <+Maids4lyfe> @nolifegamin thank you!
[2:00:02] <$RaikenTB> Thanks, Hydrobot.
[2:00:04] <awsomesaucekirby> H2O
[2:00:05] <$mandragoraroot> HYDRATE PAT
[2:00:13] <MeowmereArt> drink some water pat
[2:00:17] <%badmr7> time to chug water
[2:00:18] <$RaikenTB> Pat needs a redbull bot.
[2:00:20] <mojomoud> Did anyone else notice that Nero gets a new animation set when he uses the Mega Buster in DMC5's video showing it?
[2:00:24] <awsomesaucekirby> drink up, GLUGGLUGGLUG
[2:00:24] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Stand still pat
[2:00:27] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Its Red orbs
[2:00:27] <+FrostMass22> Drink the Elmo water
[2:00:28] <OkamiDude15> woopsSip
[2:00:29] <+Griffin1171> red orbs
[2:00:29] <bagheadlive> time to get wet pat
[2:00:32] <+imextremelymanly> Damage
[2:00:33] <DXLelouch24> nah when he gets his arm back its probably gonna absorb the other arm abilities and add new skills and let them be swappable
[2:00:37] <%xemnahort> @seniorwhiteface I mean are you separating Agni and rudra since I’m pretty sure that’s who you are fighting
[2:00:37] <knomad2b> buffs almost everything
[2:00:38] <gustavozxd> red orbs are kinda useless anyway
[2:00:40] <mojomoud> he basically replaces Blue Rose with it and changes his jump animation a bit
[2:00:41] <Mattmandx1> It makes your slash do gooder
[2:00:46] <seniorwhiteface> I might just chesse it out and farm for like three holy waters just to end my sufering
[2:00:49] <knomad2b> speed too i think
[2:00:56] <EBT93> @gustavozxd It’s so good. Man, I can’t wait for that game to come out. I’m honestly more excited for DMC5 than I was with P5
[2:01:03] <+TheImmortal70> @seniorwhiteface where?
[2:01:06] <juhbathehutt> beowolf gets a third charge too
[2:01:22] <%badmr7> At max
[2:01:22] <+imextremelymanly> music is not as good
[2:01:24] <%badmr7> you aren't max
[2:01:25] <rumuloh> Best enemies in the series
[2:01:25] <gustavozxd> @ebt93 same
[2:01:26] <LiquidMathew> Do you think Nero will get a "true" Devil Trigger?
[2:01:27] <Mattmandx1> I really want them to make Red Queen easier to use with quicker rev speed in DMC5
[2:01:27] <helpmeimafruit> has anyone seen that picture of dan southward shirtless with the katana, how is it possible to get so fucking ripped
[2:01:28] <+TheImmortal70> Max concentraton dud
[2:01:28] <+BrendorTheEndor> only at max concentration
[2:01:28] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Basically, you get extra shit when you roleplay as vergil by standing still/walking
[2:01:31] <+tnomads> Persona 5 being out in Japan for like a year before it came overseas was really annoying
[2:01:35] <NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat Third Charge at max concentration.
[2:01:35] <rumuloh> Frosts are so good
[2:01:37] <+dodge_and_dust> only at full concentration
[2:01:38] <Dragonfang1337> elmo is MAX CONCENTRATED
[2:01:40] <bagheadlive> the Devil Breakers in 5 seem like the best way to mix up Nero, still think it's dumb you can't cycle between them (not counting the deluxe edition breaker)
[2:01:40] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Beowolf is the best one, I love it so good
[2:01:46] <IShadowStrykerI> no pat, don't waste DT level 3 DRD the boss plz
[2:01:49] <gustavozxd> @ebt93 I've actually never been this excited for a game in my life
[2:01:57] <ghostravens> i forgot, did nero have a DT?
[2:01:58] <+dodge_and_dust> the third charge does SO much damage
[2:02:00] <Graxe_> And if you time your input release at the moment it flashes, the attack power is increased.
[2:02:01] <+BrendorTheEndor> level 3 charge is identical to level 2 just charge though
[2:02:02] <seniorwhiteface> @xemnahort Well I tend to go after the fire guy, because hw is weak to cerberus I think , and then deal with thing 2 failing.
[2:02:07] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Yeah, Nero has his STAND
[2:02:08] <+nolifegamin> Vergil's dick doubles in length at full concentration
[2:02:09] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Nero does not have a dt
[2:02:10] <Graxe_> Like Dante with Gilgamesh.
[2:02:10] <Mattmandx1> @helpmeimafruit That's the power of the Quantum Ranger
[2:02:11] <helpmeimafruit> @ghostravens not a traditional one, but he gets a nelo angelo stand
[2:02:12] <bagheadlive> any idea if Combat Ajudgicatornators are in 5?
[2:02:17] <+razielhex> A-A-AATOMIC KOMBOO
[2:02:19] <$Sayie> @ghostravens Kinda? He has a sick stand in replacement and gets kinda devily
[2:02:19] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat so many games for you guys to play next year cirTan
[2:02:21] <KingyoNingyo> beat it up, pat
[2:02:21] <xiccy> There's also a Frame-1 release that makes it damn near Just Impact
[2:02:28] <rytisone> what if this adjudicator just said "only some weirdo wepon that you dont have can hurt me"
[2:02:29] <+razielhex> SSsssssssssssssssssssmokin'
[2:02:29] <+TheImmortal70> Combat adjudicators have already been shown to be in five
[2:02:32] <%Jp3g95> BLORB
[2:02:32] <arkv01> god i could just bend vergil over for days
[2:02:37] <seniorwhiteface> @theimmortal70 Mission 5 DMC 3
[2:02:37] <ghostravens> @helpmeimafruit @Sayie gotcha. thank you
[2:02:38] <+TheImmortal70> I think it was in dante's gameplay segment
[2:02:38] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> moon2EZ
[2:02:40] <$mandragoraroot> Clap
[2:02:40] <EBT93> @gustavozxd For me, I think it has to do with the fact the DMC came back from it’s reboot. In most cases, when a reboot fails, that shit’s dead.
[2:02:42] <Buzzard42> we all could
[2:02:42] <Estuko> @arkv01 my heart, please it can't take it
[2:02:43] <%noajenkk> @AngriestPat you beating that beowulf adjudicator in mission 16 of the dmc3 lp WITHOUT swordmaster was truly inspiring
[2:02:44] <bagheadlive> @TheImmortal70 Awesome!!
[2:02:48] <OkamiDude15> @bagheadlive i feel like i saw one when they did a gameplay demo of 5 a couple weeks ago
[2:02:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> !uptime
[2:02:54] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 2m 56s.
[2:03:00] <%xemnahort> @seniorwhiteface I would actually recommend the opposite because the survivor picks up the losing sword but I believe keeps its weakness
[2:03:00] <+TheImmortal70> @seniorwhiteface My dude you are not even fighting with devil trigger yet, you can do it
[2:03:07] <BlitzChocula> you think Vergil was a little shit when he was a kid?
[2:03:14] <+TheImmortal70> @seniorwhiteface Just equip trickster and teleport your ass to victory
[2:03:20] <+tnomads> btw you absolutely can distort that shoryuken
[2:03:24] <+BrendorTheEndor> level 3 charge and level 2 just charge are the same thing tho
[2:03:28] <seniorwhiteface> @xemnahort Yeah Ill try that.
[2:03:29] <Mattmandx1> It's like fully charging a greatsword
[2:03:30] <xiccy> Nah Virgil has or for Beowulf too.
[2:03:31] <gustavozxd> i've seen a lot of people asking for vergil to be playable/show up in 5, but come on guys, do you really think they'd show him?
[2:03:32] <OkamiDude15> monkaOMEGA
[2:03:34] <rytisone> waow
[2:03:36] <%badmr7> @AngriestPat will murder just about everything
[2:03:36] <itsya_boi_gappy> @AngriestPat pat i know yall touch on it in the dmc3 lp about how you are not a fan of dmc4 dante so how do you feel about dmc 5 dante so far?
[2:03:39] <Your_Friendly_Futa> I love this game so much!!
[2:03:39] <+TheImmortal70> @angriestpat ON a stunned Berial, you can do like 1/4 to 1/3 health
[2:03:40] <+Raymanguy13> slick
[2:03:41] <DXLelouch24> you can Distorted Real Impact the Shoryuken btw PAT
[2:03:45] <+imextremelymanly> you can fly with trickster I've seen it
[2:03:50] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Does this mean were not gonna get a DMC4 LP?
[2:03:53] <gustavozxd> if he's there, we won't see him at all ever in any official trailer most likely
[2:03:54] <%xemnahort> @seniorwhiteface also it’s a fight that is probably good to take slowly and focus on dodging and only attacking during big openings
[2:04:04] <%goose_attack_almanac> Carnage is a tortured soul! You don't know!
[2:04:11] <$mandragoraroot> thank god
[2:04:14] <$Niney_Who> Carnage totally has mercy guys
[2:04:15] <$RaikenTB> He doesn't look as old as I thought he'd be.
[2:04:17] <+TheImmortal70> Who here is gonna use EVERYTHING?
[2:04:19] <DXLelouch24> no more mashing like a crazy persons?
[2:04:20] <+Silentman0> @AngriestPat when are you going to be on what a cartoon? woolie's been on it already and matt's been on twice
[2:04:21] <DXLelouch24> thank od
[2:04:24] <+TheImmortal70> Because I know I am
[2:04:24] <+imextremelymanly> I take two please
[2:04:24] <DXLelouch24> god*
[2:04:25] <gustavozxd> dmc4 forced style switching is lame
[2:04:28] <OkamiDude15> SWORD-TRICK-SWOR-GUN-TRICK-DARK-TRICK-SWORD-ROYAL-TRICK-SWORD woopsEZ
[2:04:35] <Mattmandx1> You don't need to slow down by scrolling through so many weapons now
[2:04:38] <gustavozxd> all the styles in 4 are bad so you HAVE to switch
[2:04:41] <%Hilleltaco> Though at the same time you can also bring every weapon with you if you want
[2:04:43] <Prism_Wing> I'm gonna use zero weapons Kappa
[2:04:46] <seniorwhiteface> @theimmortal70 Thats the thing I got trickster and air hike but I think thars a bad spot for it as the bosses jump in rhe air alot and swat me like a fly.
[2:04:48] <arkv01> pat be honest, do you think V's gameplay is going to SUCK HUGE ASS
[2:04:48] <+tnomads> I loved rebellion and gilgamesh but Lucefer felt like such a dud to me
[2:04:57] <+trekkie11041> its gonna be sparda + cerberus for me
[2:04:58] <$BeardedLuchador> agreed
[2:05:04] <TheGershon> I feel like a big problem with 4Dante is just how obtuse Lucifer and Pandora are, which is 1/3 of his moveset
[2:05:06] <LiquidMathew> Its just Left or Right Trigger with 3 though?
[2:05:07] <+GuelermeDias> lucifer is weird
[2:05:08] <%RogueInfinity> Woo!
[2:05:09] <IShadowStrykerI> you can distort all the beowulf moves, no?
[2:05:09] <+TheImmortal70> @OkamiDude15 You forgot the whooshing sounds of dante using Lucifer into three jank ass momentum dashes backwards up and forward
[2:05:10] <2dMoth> lucifer was too weird for my taste
[2:05:13] <DXLelouch24> i want V to play like a Stand user
[2:05:13] <+CaptainJax> and he also gets HAT GUN
[2:05:14] <mojomoud> @AngriestPat In the event that you and the other best friends decide to do a playthrough of the Resident Evil 2 remake, what are the chances that Crazy Talk will activate?
[2:05:15] <bursky00> The problem with DMC 4 Dante is that the game is build for Nero, so playing Dante in general made it awkward.
[2:05:19] <+GuelermeDias> pandora i just used as a quick "fuck everything" gun
[2:05:19] <gustavozxd> no million stabs for shotgun, no triple dash unless DT
[2:05:22] <DXLelouch24> with multiple stands
[2:05:22] <+imextremelymanly> I feel like V gameplay is going to be like Lady in this one
[2:05:29] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Yeah Lucifer is rough
[2:05:31] <Cykaima> What's up PAT how's it hangin
[2:05:35] <+TheImmortal70> @seniorwhiteface If you are absolutely struggling with them, just watch the best friends lp and watch
[2:05:35] <gustavozxd> pandora also sucks
[2:05:40] <DXLelouch24> Pat theres an Agni and Rudra Mod
[2:05:41] <+DoctorIdiot> why no monster hunter
[2:05:42] <%RogueInfinity> Lucifer is very confusing to use
[2:05:43] <Donchalant402> pandora is great
[2:05:43] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Nah Pandora is great
[2:05:44] <helpmeimafruit> Pandora's godlike
[2:05:45] <EBT93> Lucifer’s trash
[2:05:45] <mojomoud> I actually really like Lucifer
[2:05:48] <+GuelermeDias> Pandora is easy.
[2:05:48] <+imextremelymanly> vamp behind them
[2:05:49] <arkv01> i can't see summons being fun in an character action game like dmc where the fun is about smashings things with your character
[2:05:49] <+nolifegamin> Lucifer was a cool idea, but it kinda felt like they basically tried turning summoned swords into a weapon which is lame
[2:05:51] <BlitzChocula> can you actually edit the position of the weapons on the weapon wheel/bar in DMC5? that would be amazing.
[2:05:53] <DXLelouch24> that replaces Lucifer
[2:05:57] <mojomoud> Pandora though, not my bag
[2:05:58] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Like I really love Pandora
[2:05:58] <yendoria> Shout out to this sick track that ONLY PLAYS TWICE IN THE WHOLE GAME
[2:06:00] <+StrangeCoincidence> acquiring lucifer is hilarious tho
[2:06:01] <+TheImmortal70> MY problem with Lucifer is simple
[2:06:02] <mojomoud> But Ican see the appeal
[2:06:09] <seniorwhiteface> @xemnahort I do get a little swing happy because I get the one parry, then I think Im a big boy now that can parry everything. I cannot.
[2:06:09] <+TheImmortal70> Why the FUCK isn't lucifer and gilgamesh one weapon
[2:06:10] <$Sayie> I wish I had more opportunities to use Dante's weapons in 4 since his story goes really fast
[2:06:10] <keksisblyat> Gotta go @angriestpat and chat have a good night
[2:06:16] <Mattmandx1> @arkv01 Isn't Doppleganger pretty much a summon though?
[2:06:20] <helpmeimafruit> Is Pandora's pulp fiction attack the best way to beat Fausts or was I doing it wrong
[2:06:21] <gustavozxd> pandora is slow, doesn't do enough damage in most moves and....meh
[2:06:24] <+trekkie11041> @BlitzChocula thats already confirmed
[2:06:25] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Pulling out the rockets, doing the 2 circles and then getting the beam, So good
[2:06:26] <%badmr7> @AngriestPat rapid slash can get behind them and Starfall will launch tem
[2:06:27] <xiccy> You mean Gilglimesh
[2:06:35] <%xemnahort> I’ve actually not finished the Nero/Dante mode yet so I still don’t know what Lucifer is. I’ve barely gotten pandora
[2:06:36] <+GuelermeDias> pandora beam destroys things tho
[2:06:37] <BlitzChocula> @trekkie11041 eggcellent!
[2:06:38] <IShadowStrykerI> okay yeah looked it up you can distort beowulf charge moves especially at level 3 charge
[2:06:38] <arkv01> @Mattmandx1 yeah pretty much, no need to go to the polls on how popular that was
[2:06:39] <+TheImmortal70> Lucifer+gilgamesh is a solid weapon
[2:06:39] <+StrangeCoincidence> I'm listening on low and I thought that BGM was Bob Holly's theme from WWF
[2:06:41] <%Basch71> I like lucifer and pandora for styling on demons
[2:06:43] <DXLelouch24> theres an agni rudra mod that replaces lucifer
[2:06:48] <gustavozxd> the beam is one of the only good moves in pandora
[2:06:49] <+nolifegamin> why isn't Lucifer a GUN!? maybe that'd be better
[2:06:57] <+zetaplus> Pandora is amazing for gatling gun
[2:06:58] <+imextremelymanly> pandora was best gun
[2:07:00] <TheGershon> WHAT
[2:07:05] <Buzzard42> >A
[2:07:05] <$Sayie> Pandora is so good
[2:07:06] <+Maids4lyfe> lucifer was a rose
[2:07:07] <Buzzard42> pathetic
[2:07:07] <+in_spaaace> How do you feel about Cerberus in DMC5
[2:07:08] <vampireinarm> SAB
[2:07:08] <$Niney_Who> SAB
[2:07:08] <+TheImmortal70> Both Lucifer and Gilgamesh are short range weapons with similar purposes
[2:07:10] <bendatron> but lucifer is rad
[2:07:11] <troxcree> It's lightsabers or whatever.
[2:07:11] <EBT93> @helpmeimafruit It’s the fastest way to decloak them
[2:07:13] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Lucifer is a Demon
[2:07:13] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 Me and my friends have a shared vrv account, this morning i woke up and went to continue watching yugioh 5ds, and i saw on the continue watching list something called "goblin slayer". now, I'm a fan of goblins, always hate how they're shit on, christ, my usernames on twitter and dnd beyond are 2goblins in an overcoat. I like them, they're scrappy and are tragic fallen heroes in my eyes.
[2:07:13] <edfiggz> Hey pat which is better Gilgamesh or Beowulf?
[2:07:15] <Fujiwara_92> SAB
[2:07:16] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Love Pandora
[2:07:18] <$BeardedLuchador> yeah I never touched Lucifer
[2:07:21] <seniorwhiteface> @theimmortal70 I watched that part thinking,"Yeah they getting stuck on this one for sure, only for pat to beat them in 3 minutes like nothing.
[2:07:23] <%noajenkk> pat, would you be into agni and rudra coming back for V? or do you not see that as possible? according to a novel they're not dante's anymore or something
[2:07:24] <SirAlan76> I like how Lucifer's rose throw is a taunt in dmc5
[2:07:25] <%Basch71> DT Stinger is great tho
[2:07:31] <LiquidMathew> Pandora is good for skipping that one secret mission with the lasers
[2:07:33] <rumuloh> SAB
[2:07:37] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Pat, how do you feel about Dante potentially having 5 weapons?
[2:07:39] <XdaXcaptainX> lucifer takes a lot of getting used to
[2:07:40] <$rdark_ksu> dang it I didnt get the notice and i'm 2 hours late.
[2:07:45] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You know what BAD is backwards?.... apatDab
[2:07:45] <$BeardedLuchador> I liked Agni and Rudra but I'm ok with new weps for a new game
[2:07:46] <helpmeimafruit> bip
[2:07:46] <+TheImmortal70> Like seriously, gilgafer
[2:07:48] <gustavozxd> @liquidmathew the only reason anyone would ever use that move
[2:07:49] <xeros720> time for an Elmo break
[2:07:49] <OkamiDude15> i really wanted to like lucifer but i never got good enough to use it
[2:07:52] <bendatron> i still dont understand how to use pandora
[2:08:01] <Mattmandx1> I mean I really like Artemis in DMC3 but only in Gunslinger style. I think all weapons have value but they should let the player customize their loadout like their doing in DMC5
[2:08:08] <nepwar> yoo is stream over, or is pat just taking a break?
[2:08:08] <gustavozxd> i wish we had kalina ann instead of pandora
[2:08:11] <helpmeimafruit> 5 minute piss
[2:08:11] <OkamiDude15> how do you build meter for pandora again? woopsThink
[2:08:11] <Lithdoran> goddamnit, I tuned in right at the break
[2:08:11] <+nolifegamin> I'll say my favorite part of Lucifer is the infinite roses Dante can spawn from his mouth
[2:08:14] <$Niney_Who> 5 MINUTES TO PEE?
[2:08:18] <$RaikenTB> Quick Paige hide his red bull
[2:08:22] <$Niney_Who> WHAT DOES RED BULL DO TO YOU???
[2:08:23] <+TheImmortal70> @OkamiDude15 You shoot
[2:08:26] <mojomoud> Can we talk about that fucking hat weapon though?
[2:08:27] <+TheImmortal70> @OkamiDude15 A lot
[2:08:29] <TheGershon> Whoever mentioned the Agni and Rudra mod, THANK YOU SO MUCH
[2:08:30] <+TheImmortal70> FAUST HAT
[2:08:31] <gustavozxd> @okamidude15 any of the square moves
[2:08:33] <+TheImmortal70> THE ANTI TRANSACTION
[2:08:34] <EBT93> Pandora’s Omen is really good for decloaking Fausts and Mephistos. And it can also get rid of the Blitz’s charge instantly.
[2:08:34] <arkv01> excellentt, time to have that secret demon sex orgy chat
[2:08:35] <$RaikenTB> @Niney_Who It gives you wings
[2:08:38] <mojomoud> SHIT LOOKS SO AWESOME
[2:08:39] <awsomesaucekirby> cher232 . So i clicked it to see what it was, Whoever stopped it was halfway through the first episode, and i was voicing my complaints alout as it loaded up. My god, what i saw made me stop right there and slam my laptop shut. It was basically the backstory of the blonde girl from BTOOM!! shit was fuuucked
[2:08:40] <OkamiDude15> big shoots? got it woopsADD
[2:08:41] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Niney_Who It gives you wings
[2:08:43] <+TheImmortal70> BE A FLAMBOYANT COWBOY TO DESTROY MICRONTRANSACTIONS
[2:08:46] <+imextremelymanly> you have to charge up pandora. tap once for little power, twice for more, three time for ultimate laser power
[2:08:46] <SuperSaiyanSora> !uptime
[2:08:47] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 8m 48s.
[2:08:50] <xiccy> Gilglimesh is just better Beowulf, just like Beowulf is just better Ifrit.
[2:08:52] <%SuperCasualBoom> Off to piss on Paige’s pants
[2:08:57] <+Griffin1171> he's gotta wash all those gout acid crystals out of his dick bone joints
[2:08:58] <Prism_Wing> I see no reason not to just offer every weapon ever as DLC down the line.
[2:09:00] <+TheImmortal70> Gilgamesh ain't better beowulf WHAT
[2:09:02] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Vergil is NOT a Busty Samurai
[2:09:02] <gustavozxd> did anyone ever use the box opening move or the chair move with pandora? on purpose? ever?
[2:09:04] <arkv01> more like pee directly into her mouth
[2:09:08] <+Anonymasque> Red Bulls down the Yellow River ~ A film by Martin Scorcese
[2:09:09] <arkv01> kinky household
[2:09:12] <+TheImmortal70> Gilgamesh would be better beowulf if it was combined with lucifer like I want
[2:09:19] <+TheImmortal70> But it's just literally standard punch moveset
[2:09:19] <cherubsanonymous> I'M A SHAPESHIFTER
[2:09:35] <+TheImmortal70> Real impact is there, you got your charge punches with an engine this time
[2:09:39] <gustavozxd> gilgamesh felt a bit too slow compared to Beowulf
[2:09:40] <+TheImmortal70> And kick 13
[2:09:40] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @cherubsanonymous no you're not
[2:09:42] <arkv01> ill shift your shape guuurl
[2:09:42] <OkamiDude15> @TheImmortal70 of dante doesnt say "are you really gonna pass by without saying howdy" as a taunt or in a cutscene the game is immediately a 0/10
[2:09:45] <+nolifegamin> I'll say I like Ifrit's visual design the best, I like my fire punchies
[2:09:47] <+around_40_jobbers> IM A SHAPSHEFTER
[2:09:49] <$ooblagis> Is this still going?
[2:09:52] <EBT93> @gustavozxd It’s useful to decloak fausts and gets rid of blitz’s charge

[2:10:41] <+TheImmortal70> Because DMC2 is garbage
[2:10:44] <TheBlankAce> I thought going to pee was the keyword for Woolie to show up with a second controller
[2:10:45] <rumuloh> It was made bad
[2:10:45] <IShadowStrykerI> no one will remember the easy mode when you one shot a boss

[2:14:58] <%xemnahort> @supercasualboom 11.5
[2:15:00] <+GuelermeDias> Japan is the Land of Don't Get Caught Tho
[2:15:02] <+imextremelymanly> harsh
[2:15:04] <arkv01> being put on trial is like legal hiv
[2:15:05] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Trial by jury indeed
[2:15:07] <SailingSaturn> Ace Attorney is a Parody of the Court System cirTan
[2:15:07] <+redstonej> over justice
[2:15:07] <bursky00> They're so bad at solving crimes though
[2:15:08] <arkv01> you're donsies
[2:15:10] <$RaikenTB> They didn't even have jurors until recently.
[2:15:12] <seniorwhiteface> Japan known for big crime all time
[2:15:14] <$rdark_ksu> Dude Japan is rad but also kinda fucked
[2:15:15] <$HeavyMettle> but they also like to sweep things under the rug to try and soften their crime stats
[2:15:15] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Japan is LITERALLY Ace Attourney where you have to FIGHT for your innocence
[2:15:18] <gustavozxd> which is why ace attorney exists
[2:15:21] <Zeikier> needs more drop kicking criminals
[2:15:24] <%superorangerobin> Japan just seems like a country that runs on PTSD
[2:15:25] <arkv01> @rdark_ksu you can't be rad without being fucked
[2:15:26] <%Beough> WHAT IS THIS SONG? I FUCKING LOVE IT
[2:15:28] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Japan is fun to visit, I would never fucking live there

[2:15:39] <cherubsanonymous> Wow, Pat
[2:15:43] <Zansatsu0379> 99% conviction rate means that Judge Eyes will be even more crazy
[2:15:46] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You can be held without trial for like 30 days before being charged and they can just re arrest you again after the thirty days
[2:15:50] <prettypatties97> I can't wait to play as Neo in DMC V
[2:15:51] <$RaikenTB> @SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz I did it for 3 years. Gets pretty tiring.

[2:21:35] <arkv01> look man when a kitty nyaaas its offering to suck yo dick
[2:21:38] <arkv01> you should oblige

[2:21:49] <Worldbrand> pat gnome
[2:21:49] <%crimsonharvest> thats right youre a GUTTER DWARF
[2:21:50] <+GuelermeDias> Pat is a hobbit/leprechaun
[2:21:50] <HoIlywood_SN> is it weird if i want to read the goblin slayer manga but not watch the anime
[2:21:51] <%xemnahort> I didn’t hear Elmo but I did hear someone yelling on someone’s tv with perfect timing for pat to react
[2:21:51] <+around_40_jobbers> Duergar clearly
[2:21:55] <Bouldus> ^
[2:21:57] <+DesertOfSand> They'd make a sequel to Anarchy Reigns, but there's no money in it, and they gotta get the cash gotta get the dough
[2:21:58] <Graywolf_the_45th> Pat's a leprechaun
[2:21:59] <Zeikier> here I wanna beat up the boss with his severed limbs, oh I keep getting juggled and OTG'd that's fine

[2:22:33] <Zeikier> couch ban
[2:22:34] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 basically i came into the video halfway through, and the scene was basically the backstory tom the blond girl from BTOOM!!
[2:22:34] <%superorangerobin> @Hilleltaco They'd need a Thigh Slider for that
[2:22:39] <Fujiwara_92> HE'S RIGHT
[2:22:40] <SWFanatic> So let the baby have the spot be pristine
[2:22:43] <SWFanatic> Hes worth it

[2:46:31] <%JaydenSai> Judge Cut @AngriestPat
[2:46:33] <Graxe_> The faster ways are using Blistering Swords, Spiral Swords, and Storm Swords.
[2:46:34] <Ranger747> His Summon sword barrage skill is nice
[2:46:37] <%xemnahort> @raymanguy13 good night
[2:46:40] <Your_Friendly_Futa> No, these enemies are cool
[2:46:41] <EBT93> Does Pat have any of the Summoned Sword formations?
[2:46:44] <+GuelermeDias> do just judgement cuts you coward
[2:46:49] <BritishBulldork> You can deflect the finger stab. Just hit it and it blows them open for countering.
[2:46:53] <%Hilleltaco> Blistering swords can take the shroud out in 1
[2:46:53] <%badmr7> if you can lad the perfect it will tear the mist off
[2:46:53] <Donchalant402> Hitomi J Cut
[2:47:01] <$Niney_Who> wow
[2:47:04] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Pat is a coward
[2:47:06] <%Jinrou7> lame
[2:47:10] <Inebriateddonut> summon swords de-clothe them good
[2:47:10] <%xemnahort> Welp tab is getting low so I’m heading out night all
[2:47:13] <LiquidMathew> Summon sword gets ridiculously fast when maxed
[2:47:22] <Vorsun> Nice one
[2:47:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> just judgement slashes are weird, i just learned that was a thing recemtly
[2:47:24] <Fujiwara_92> Pat talks about himself in the 3rd person
[2:47:26] <bagheadlive> dude Hitomi Tanaka is like a K or higher cup now
[2:47:26] <Graxe_> A good chunk of Vergil's damage come from his summoned sword moves, though.
[2:47:26] <$mandragoraroot> l a m e s t p a t
[2:47:27] <EBT93> They’re really good, though
[2:47:28] <+TheImmortal70> The WORST
[2:47:29] <Your_Friendly_Futa> IIRC this is the most pain in the ass mission
[2:47:32] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Projectile weapons always THROW the best parties though
[2:47:34] <%SirTopHat_III> "Pat doesn't care for projectile weapons" SAYS THE MAN WHO LOVES GUN
[2:47:34] <%Hilleltaco> Summon swords are also super strong because all the techniques can be used during literally anything else
[2:47:35] <rytisone> taunt
[2:47:38] <nepwar> LUL
[2:47:39] <prettypatties97> Pat is so cool he plays on easy mode
[2:47:39] <%Divryne> Taunt and dodge.
[2:47:45] <$mandragoraroot> ?
[2:47:51] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> If you're not shooting out swords like an asshole as virgil, are you really even virgil?
[2:47:54] <Your_Friendly_Futa> YEP. It has to be in this tiny tiny room
[2:48:01] <frozenwaifu> anything is possible, just do it you fuck
[2:48:06] <$mandragoraroot> m6kwLukeno
[2:48:08] <Salty3acon> taunt him to DEATH
[2:48:11] <Crankthulhu> IIRC some Blue Orb missions are nearly impossible as Vergil
[2:48:14] <%Hilleltaco> "You thing you s-OUGH... You think you stand a chance?"
[2:48:15] <+imextremelymanly> very
[2:48:15] <%Beough> Not like that Pat
[2:48:16] <helpmeimafruit> this secret mission is next to impossible without nero or dante
[2:48:18] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Does Pat think he stands a chance?
[2:48:19] <rytisone> also enemy step I believe. this is a hard one
[2:48:19] <Royal8383> yeah its hard as fuck
[2:48:19] <gustavozxd> enemy step also gets style
[2:48:20] <Zeikier> "don't break too quickly, now!"
[2:48:21] <Ranger747> once taunt gets its full animation out it helps. its hard
[2:48:21] <$mandragoraroot> siderolls pat
[2:48:26] <%Beough> The key is to NOT get hit
[2:48:26] <Zeikier> "gonna show me a good time?"
[2:48:27] <DracaenaLeaf> Do you think you stand a chance
[2:48:28] <medril07> yes
[2:48:29] <+TheImmortal70> @angriespat It's much easier with dante with royal guard or nero with enemy grab
[2:48:31] <%Jinrou7> "the true warrior enters the arena with all his powers at the ready"
[2:48:33] <b1gboss007> F
[2:48:33] <+GuelermeDias> you think you stand a chance?
[2:48:39] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> E A S Y M O D E
[2:48:40] <$mandragoraroot> NotLikeThis
[2:48:43] <EBT93> This is pretty much only doable with Nero
[2:48:45] <%jiin6> Abandon your hope
[2:48:46] <prettypatties97> good work
[2:48:47] <%Jp3g95> Easy Mode is now selectable
[2:48:47] <b1gboss007> play it on easy
[2:48:52] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Eeeeh? only babies play on Easy Mode
[2:48:52] <MonsieurHedge> defeated....
[2:49:03] <arkv01> i'll summon ur swords guuurl
[2:49:03] <b1gboss007> Thats why
[2:49:03] <helpmeimafruit> @AngriestPat get to the next checkpoint before attempting the secret mission again, it'll load you after fighting the Mephistos
[2:49:09] <medril07> does pat know about powered up swords
[2:49:14] <Donchalant402> crazy talk
[2:49:15] <%Beough> CRAZY TALK ACTIVATE
[2:49:20] <prettypatties97> For real though, what mode is he actually on?
[2:49:22] <%Jp3g95> apatCrazy
[2:49:26] <medril07> normal
[2:49:30] <%Jp3g95> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[2:49:30] <%JaydenSai> @prettypatties97 Normal
[2:49:32] <EBT93> You just need to git gud, Pat Kappa
[2:49:35] <AlasterAngelo> how did vergil have beowulf and force edge tho
[2:49:36] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Upgrade your projectiles you coward
[2:49:36] <+TheRaveous> wait, does devil may cry 4 stream on here mean no devil may cry 4 playthrough on the channel?
[2:49:38] <Donchalant402> he is on the hard mode isnt he
[2:49:38] <%badmr7> @AngriestPat You teleport up to them and do aerial combo>J Cut
[2:49:38] <%Hilleltaco> You can fire summon swords at the same time as other stuff if you get your claw hand goin'
[2:49:38] <+GuelermeDias> why not devil hunter
[2:49:47] <Donchalant402> yeah aint he on devil hunter
[2:49:49] <medril07> dh is normal
[2:49:53] <Your_Friendly_Futa> These guys seem annoying to fight when your not Nero or have Gunslinger
[2:49:53] <bagheadlive> @AlasterAngelo pure will power
[2:49:57] <helpmeimafruit> FrankerZ
[2:49:58] <+GuelermeDias> normal is normal

[2:50:10] <+GuelermeDias> ldk is like hard dh
[2:50:11] <rytisone> I like dogs
[2:50:13] <+TheImmortal70> It's almost as if an enemy with a health shield is a bad enemy
[2:50:17] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Show dongs
[2:50:17] <arkv01> gurl i'lll dabbb your doggo
[2:50:18] <prettypatties97> Cool, thanks guys, I got here late so I wasn't actually sure
[2:50:20] <nepwar> amazing
[2:50:25] <+TheImmortal70> DRIVE
[2:50:33] <$mandragoraroot> i got a dog for you pat FrankerZ
[2:50:35] <medril07> that is a cool move
[2:50:42] <medril07> overdrive
[2:50:43] <helpmeimafruit> @AngriestPat GET TO THE NEXT CHECKPOINT FIRST
[2:50:47] <+Gorgodrn> Vergil's Drive is so cool
[2:50:48] <DXLelouch24> just a straight up Getsuga Tensho
[2:50:54] <frozenwaifu> whats paige's favorite breed of dogs. yorkshire poodles are pretty darn cute
[2:50:55] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat do you want me to send you dog pictures?
[2:50:55] <+TheImmortal70> You literally just take dante's best moves and add them onto Vergil
[2:50:57] <LiquidMathew> near miss?
[2:50:58] <+GuelermeDias> Incubus' Drive is better
[2:51:04] <%Divryne> If they hit your iframes you get style.
[2:51:04] <+ChrisAlgoo> the newest edge lord
[2:51:05] <%Hilleltaco> If you dodge with good enough timing
[2:51:05] <knomad2b> tablehopper
[2:51:06] <rytisone> dodgning enemy atacks
[2:51:06] <+TheRaveous> you're dodging attacks
[2:51:07] <medril07> dodge at the last second?
[2:51:08] <Graxe_> If you dodge at the last moment, you gain style meter.
[2:51:09] <%Basch71> its basically perfect dodging
[2:51:12] <Inebriateddonut> You get style on perfect dodges I think
[2:51:12] <Your_Friendly_Futa> You need to perfect doge
[2:51:15] <bagheadlive> you have to side roll at like, the last second when avoiding attacks
[2:51:16] <nepwar> its like burnout with near miss
[2:51:20] <Your_Friendly_Futa> And if you get hit, you lose the style
[2:51:22] <Royal8383> I think it means when you dodge at the last second. Mad Stylish
[2:51:25] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Which is why FUCK that mission
[2:51:34] <$mandragoraroot> its a dodge, has i frames
[2:51:47] <%Hilleltaco> Remember you can rapid slash through them
[2:51:47] <rytisone> dont forget behind the mirror
[2:51:55] <%badmr7> They can't block starfall
[2:51:56] <bagheadlive> when I did that mission I just did the cheese where you hold the scarecorw with buster and the enemy attacking it ups your rank
[2:52:03] <BlitzChocula> what're the chances Vergil's DT in DMC5 is straight up Nelo Angelo?
[2:52:05] <Graxe_> Technically, everyone can complete that secret mission. But Nero once he has Aegis Shield can do it really easy.
[2:52:05] <EBT93> Man, I wish Rising Sun was available outside of DT.
[2:52:19] <AlasterAngelo> wait where's Vergil's top hat?
[2:52:22] <%Divryne> Perfect dodges give you style.
[2:52:24] <gustavozxd> they can block everything except the Power button
[2:52:24] <Graxe_> Or Dante if you're good with Royal Guard.
[2:52:28] <+TheRaveous> taunts + dodging attacks
[2:52:31] <+TheImmortal70> IT really isn't
[2:52:40] <thebeatsandrhymes> just git gud
[2:52:43] <prettypatties97> Just do combo Pat
[2:52:43] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Oh yeaaaah that would work good with Dante
[2:52:49] <b1gboss007> off, ahhh
[2:52:54] <Fujiwara_92> I can't do it Pat, it's impossible - Pat/Paige
[2:53:00] <$mandragoraroot> perfect jump dodging should as well
[2:53:03] <+TheRaveous> also taunt
[2:53:04] <frozenwaifu> how can this be
[2:53:15] <%Hilleltaco> They do but it's hard
[2:53:20] <%Divryne> They do your style is just too low for it to pop up.
[2:53:24] <AlasterAngelo> this must be super embarassing
[2:53:25] <Royal8383> Is it a part of trickster?
[2:53:26] <$Niney_Who> EASY MODE IS NOW
[2:53:30] <+Maids4lyfe> what was pat trying to do?
[2:53:31] <%Basch71> its basically teaching you to taunt and dodge
[2:53:32] <wsintai> EASY MODE UNLOCKED
[2:53:38] <bagheadlive> some of the secret missions in 4 are way too tough, I had to use cheese n mutliple of them
[2:53:38] <42nfl19> Why doesn't pat just infinitely shoot is blades out while doing his melee combos?
[2:53:40] <%badmr7> @AngriestPat Teleport up to them
[2:53:43] <Your_Friendly_Futa> See, hate that one
[2:53:45] <Doc1790> I think it might be easier with Nero
[2:53:46] <+TheRaveous> it's easier with nero/dante tbh
[2:53:53] <AlasterAngelo> just use judgement cut
[2:53:54] <$mandragoraroot> that one sucks
[2:54:02] <+TheRaveous> especially dante, cuz you can just royal guard everything
[2:54:04] <%Basch71> not sure if Vergil's Trick works for style too
[2:54:11] <Your_Friendly_Futa> I think theres a fun one in the very next room
[2:54:17] <medril07> wonder what V's style is going to be
[2:54:27] <+TheRaveous> perfect times judgement cut gets rid of their cloacks
[2:54:29] <%Hilleltaco> Once you get blistering swords these enemies get much less annoying to take out
[2:54:29] <helpmeimafruit> "fucking nerd" style
[2:54:29] <$mandragoraroot> 4Head
[2:54:29] <%badmr7> @AngriestPat You can teleport up to them
[2:54:37] <%Hilleltaco> Costs DT meter though
[2:54:39] <rytisone> jusgment cut attacks enemies
[2:54:45] <+Gorgodrn> Do you think V uses a sword cane, or a gun cane?
[2:54:56] <bagheadlive> I'm guessing maybe V is a blue mage type? maybe he can become/summon demons?
[2:54:58] <TheGershon> My army comes from deep within
[2:55:03] <$Niney_Who> V uses a book sword and a book gun
[2:55:05] <medril07> hopefully V is a grappler. haha
[2:55:05] <Royal8383> I think Virgil only needs a C in that secret mission
[2:55:06] <%Piemen99> FaThEr
[2:55:08] <faldin> He just uses his cane
[2:55:14] <Your_Friendly_Futa> @medril07 From what was said in the rumours, which is TOTALLY LEGIT, hes going to be using summoned monsters to fight for him
[2:55:18] <medril07> suplexing everything
[2:55:20] <helpmeimafruit> V just transforms into a giant blob monster for all his attacks
[2:55:22] <Graxe_> But Vergil gets so much DT anyway, that you might as well burn it on the sword formations.
[2:55:29] <StarkAvKnark> the time has come and so have I
[2:55:30] <prettypatties97> a cane that shoots swords
[2:55:40] <TheGershon> God listening to this music again just makes me think, what in god's name were they thinking with Dante's DMC5 theme
[2:55:45] <medril07> @Your_Friendly_Futa yooo that sounds awesome
[2:55:46] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Also he might not be able to run
[2:55:51] <+ChrisAlgoo> spanking demons on the butt
[2:55:54] <TheGershon> How could that possibly have been a good idea
[2:55:55] <+Gorgodrn> Yeah, the rumors ahve been accurate since day one tbf. For Nico, for eveything else. I trust them
[2:55:57] <bagheadlive> I'm an actual cripple with a cane so I hope V is cool
[2:55:59] <LiquidMathew> Maybe a cane
[2:56:08] <AlasterAngelo> how do you kill people with a book pat dont be silly
[2:56:11] <DeepGrave> Where's Elmo?
[2:56:14] <%JaydenSai> @AngriestPat So a 'magic' user? How'd that work in DMC?
[2:56:14] <+TheRaveous> wonder if a form of vergil will be unlockable
[2:56:22] <ghostravens> maybe like, the threaded cane from bloodborne but More Stylish™
[2:56:23] <Estuko> beep beep
[2:56:23] <TheBlankAce> I have to imagine that V is gonna pull out some jester like orbs
[2:56:24] <Inebriateddonut> Wasn't it said somewhere that V would be summoning shit?
[2:56:31] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Knowledge is the deadliest weapon of them all
[2:56:39] <rytisone> magic and maybe summons
[2:56:48] <cptbellybutton352> show us to prove elmo is there we need froof we dont believe you patty
[2:56:54] <Cypherblack> i remember watching infiltration stream dmc4 playing on his stick
[2:57:01] <AlasterAngelo> with Cerberus coming back i really want agni and rudra too
[2:57:03] <bagheadlive> In one of the Terry Pratchett discworld books a guy literally gets killed buy a book thrown at him
[2:57:03] <Cypherblack> pre wife beating
[2:57:04] <DeepGrave> Do you think Vergil asked Nero's mom to call him "daddy"?
[2:57:05] <medril07> I want to find out when the game comes out. they've already shown too much
[2:57:05] <%Fenrirlives> he'll definitely have basic Cane Sword combos, but supplement a lack of mobility with his summoning skills to keep enemies away from him as a guess
[2:57:18] <+Gorgodrn> @TheRaveous Watch the latest panel interview with Itsuno and Matt when they ask him what his favorite chracter is (Vergil) and how he went "but we can't say much now"
[2:57:24] <Your_Friendly_Futa> >implying Virgil wasnt the bottom
[2:57:27] <nekodelic> @cypherblack wait, did he beat his former wife?
[2:57:31] <gustavozxd> who's voicing V and Nico, i love their voice
[2:57:37] <$serpenttucker> @Fenrirlives He likely has teleports and portals to work with too.
[2:57:41] <+TheRaveous> @Gorgodrn oh boy OH BOY
[2:57:42] <Son_Goku135> @medril07 March 8th
[2:57:44] <BlitzChocula> did you just slide up that spike
[2:57:44] <$Niney_Who> Virgil is a Power bottom
[2:57:51] <$Niney_Who> an "I need more power" bottom
[2:57:55] <Cypherblack> @nekodelic you can probably look stuff up but his sponsors still have him so maybe nothings confrimed
[2:57:58] <AlasterAngelo> reminder that if Agnus can get laid that means theres hope for everybody
[2:58:02] <%JaydenSai> @AngriestPat So V is cane combos with magic being his 'gun' button?
[2:58:03] <+TheRaveous> lmaooo
[2:58:04] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Sexy!!
[2:58:04] <%commanderclaw> Dante is a switch
[2:58:05] <$Niney_Who> Dante is a virgin
[2:58:08] <arkv01> virgils a power middle
[2:58:09] <grayjammer> Vergil is Vers
[2:58:10] <medril07> this sex is getting crazy!
[2:58:11] <%Fenrirlives> DANTE IS A FUCKING CELIBATE AND YOU KNOW IT PAT
[2:58:11] <helpmeimafruit> I NEED MORE POWER BOTTOM
[2:58:13] <nepwar> @Niney_Who LUL
[2:58:16] <+ChrisAlgoo> Vergil is an uncaring top
[2:58:19] <LiquidMathew> MIGHT CONTROLS EVERYTHING, sounds like a power bottom to me
[2:58:20] <$mandragoraroot> yes way vergil is a power bottom
[2:58:20] <+DesertOfSand> Infil being a potential spousal abuser is still unconfirmed, afaik
[2:58:23] <arkv01> virgil likes to sandwiche himself between his dear brother and mother
[2:58:23] <%Fenrirlives> HIS SEXUALITY IS PIZZA
[2:58:23] <%JaydenSai> Dante is a power bottom and Vergil is a rough top
[2:58:24] <DracaenaLeaf> Um, Stamper is a power bottom
[2:58:24] <prettypatties97> Dante is what I aspire to be, a big lame but cool virgin
[2:58:24] <AlasterAngelo> NOW... I'M MOTIVATED... TO SUCK DICK
[2:58:26] <Fujiwara_92> Dante is virgin, Nero is a botton
[2:58:27] <+ChrisAlgoo> Dante is a bratty sub
[2:58:27] <+Bupkis7> No way
[2:58:27] <marvel877> Do you want to eff Dante or get effed by Dante and the answer is always YES.
[2:58:28] <%commanderclaw> Vergil is the asshole kinda top who doesn't care if you're satisfied or not
[2:58:29] <faldin> Dante is a super power bottom
[2:58:29] <TheGershon> Somehow I see Nero more as a top than Dante
[2:58:31] <frozenwaifu> lmfao that sub
[2:58:31] <MonsieurHedge> absolutely not. a power bottom would NOT spin around a dick like a stripper pole
[2:58:36] <%Jp3g95> Virgil is a motivated top
[2:58:38] <+Hamblasto> When does Dante get any, though?
[2:58:38] <gustavozxd> Lady was having fun watching nero and kyrie kiss
[2:58:38] <bagheadlive> No I bet Dante has had sex but like, not since before DMC3
[2:58:40] <$mandragoraroot> dante doesnt know what sex is
[2:58:40] <Cypherblack> as soon as lady wouldnt kiss him dante swore celibacy
[2:58:42] <+Twin_Hallow> it can be argued power bottoms do most of the work Kappa
[2:58:42] <faldin> Vergil is a top for sure
[2:58:49] <helpmeimafruit> Vergil probably finishes in like 5 seconds and is proud of it
[2:59:01] <Doc1790> Vergil just hits it and quits it
[2:59:03] <DeepGrave> Dante probably has Trish dress up like his mom and they roleplay
[2:59:07] <medril07> Vergil's an Incel cause he got mind controlled for like 5 years before dying
[2:59:10] <+Twin_Hallow> Vergil only does missionary
[2:59:13] <knomad2b> now i'm really motivated
[2:59:15] <MonsieurHedge> vergil is a powerbottom, dante is a STANDARD bottom, and sparda is a sub
[2:59:15] <gustavozxd> vergil masturbates at judgement cut speed
[2:59:17] <%JaydenSai> Vergil has sex with you and -never- calls you back
[2:59:20] <$Niney_Who> Virgil can't be a top because his dick works like Yamato and cuts everything open.
[2:59:21] <ghostravens> honestly? vergil is that image of seto kaiba saying "i haven't losed my virginity because i never lose"
[2:59:23] <itsya_boi_gappy> but....he has a kid
[2:59:24] <+Hamblasto> It doesn't even budge unless they look like his MOMMY
[2:59:29] <+ChrisAlgoo> Vergil wears snapbacks
[2:59:31] <AlasterAngelo> FIRST
[2:59:32] <Cypherblack> @ghostravens LOL
[2:59:33] <AlasterAngelo> I
[2:59:33] <+TheRaveous> of course he finishes in five seconds. He's about efficiency, not pleasure
[2:59:34] <%Hilleltaco> Vergil gets it over with and walks out the door
[2:59:36] <gustavozxd> and then he sheates his dick back in
[2:59:37] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Virgil will take you to a fancy fish dinner, and never call you again!!
[2:59:38] <BlitzChocula> Dante walks out if Trish doesn't call him my sweet baby boy during sessions
[2:59:47] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Go back to that secret mission later as Nero cause it was designed specifically for him. The "right" way to do it is you have to grab an enemy and taunt while using it as a shield.
[2:59:49] <%Jp3g95> Dante only loves his bed and his momma, Im sorry
[2:59:52] <AlasterAngelo> dante has never even kissed a girl
[2:59:53] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:58] <prettypatties97> @blitzchocula Oh god why
[3:00:00] <+ChrisAlgoo> Nero's a jerk but will make you breakfast in the morning
[3:00:03] <$RaikenTB> LUL
[3:00:04] <Cypherblack> kind of like how some girls call their man "daddy" dante says "mommy" ahhah
[3:00:10] <$RaikenTB> Thanks Hydrobot.
[3:00:11] <Worldbrand> FOR MY MAMA
[3:00:17] <knomad2b> he does it for his momma pat
[3:00:18] <gustavozxd> Trish says "at least someone knows how to get the girl" to Dante in this game
[3:00:21] <prettypatties97> "Mother"
[3:00:21] <frozenwaifu> this is getting weirf
[3:00:21] <AlasterAngelo> reminder that Nero gets more action in a day than Dante gets in a lifetime
[3:00:22] <TheyCallMeVawn> Dante is basically Blanka
[3:00:22] <itsya_boi_gappy> did nero ever use the arm be4 dad ripped it off
[3:00:23] <TheBlankAce> Dante is the least likely to fuck though
[3:00:23] <wsintai> @ChrisAlgoo With the Romantic Vibro-Fist
[3:00:25] <%jiin6> Dante play guitar only for Momma
[3:00:28] <Graxe_> That's what we were talking about with the DT Rapid Slash.
[3:00:28] <$Niney_Who> Nero will make you a smoothie in the morning that he made by revving his sword. It'll be hot, as a result, and taste horrible
[3:00:29] <medril07> the fuck was that?
[3:00:32] <Graxe_> Just mash it.
[3:00:33] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Is it just me or was that the "UGH" of someone whos like "UGH, I-I totally dont do that"
[3:00:35] <+Hamblasto> Is Dante just Blanka?
[3:00:35] <deathscythe122887> @AngriestPat I have to say I am enjoying MonHun on PC thank you for hyping it up
[3:00:36] <+TheRaveous> yeah, DT vergil is kind of hilarious
[3:00:37] <rytisone> try that in LDK
[3:00:38] <%Fenrirlives> Nero will detonate a mechanical arm inside your vagina and do an air guitar solo
[3:00:45] <$Niney_Who> Virgil would 100% DT during sex and kill whoever he is fucking
[3:00:48] <prettypatties97> Man that stupid voice you and Woolie did for Dante is the best
[3:00:48] <+ChrisAlgoo> *woolie voice* mmmother
[3:00:49] <Fujiwara_92> Hey Virgil, your brother calls me mommy too... wtf? DansGame
[3:00:51] <bagheadlive> @Cypherblack the whole "daddy" thing really creeps me out, it's way too popular considering the implication
[3:00:54] <frozenwaifu> doesnt nero have an arm for sex?
[3:01:05] <medril07> @Fenrirlives so it is written
[3:01:06] <%badmr7> yep

[3:01:28] <TheBlankAce> He also does not know how to eat pasta
[3:01:29] <Doc1790> The Creepy Sex Arm is a Pre-Order Bonus
[3:01:30] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Nero LOVES his wife, and his Wife
[3:01:30] <prettypatties97> I wish I had a creepy sex arm
[3:01:30] <%CyborgAV> You mean an AWESOME sex arm
[3:01:32] <artoflec> ITS JUST FOR SHOULDER MASSAGES
[3:01:35] <gustavozxd> i'm a little disapointed with that arm's functionality
[3:01:36] <Zombrocom> It's for massages ya degenerates Kappa
[3:01:36] <knomad2b> has an amazing breaker
[3:01:37] <Your_Friendly_Futa> WAIT, I think, Nero has a Demonic arm, because Virgil DID have sex with his DT on

[3:01:55] <+TheRaveous> Nico's such a fuckin bro
[3:01:56] <$Niney_Who> @AngriestPat All Arms are Sex Arms if you aren't arthritic
[3:01:56] <+cabooseteamkill> not sure if you know or not but you can cancel the recovery of rapid slash and nearly all other moves with the teleport.
[3:01:56] <+StrangeCoincidence> HE'S GOT A BICYCLE
[3:01:56] <%Divryne> Nico is the true MVP.

[3:03:32] <Doc1790> ABDC

[3:03:34] <Your_Friendly_Futa> ABDC
[3:03:35] <+twohitgood> Daniel Espinosa to Direct
[3:03:36] <Graxe_> 40% orbs found.
[3:03:37] <Zombrocom> Google "morbius movie" .Bam.
[3:03:40] <gustavozxd> C for COWARD
[3:03:41] <$mandragoraroot> BAD GRADE
[3:03:46] <Doc1790> ruh roh
[3:03:46] <+CaptainJax> oh its planned to start filming in february
[3:03:47] <prettypatties97> Tasty, tasty C rank
[3:03:48] <frozenwaifu> no links means no proof means ITS NOT FUCKIN REAL
[3:03:49] <knomad2b> she would
[3:03:51] <Zombrocom> In November 2017, Sony Pictures announced plans to make a film adaptation of Morbius that will be part of their Sony's Marvel Universe. The film is to be written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. On June 27, 2018, it was announced that Jared Leto will star and Daniel Espinosa will direct.
[3:03:52] <medril07> THE BLACK DOCTOR WAS MORBIUS
[3:03:53] <42nfl19> "He would be in to you"
[3:03:55] <$Niney_Who> Pat would rather get an Arm to better pet Elmo
[3:03:56] <%spacekataz18> Are you implying he doesn't have a dildo arm?
[3:03:57] <%jiin6> she's seen what pat does to food
[3:03:58] <TechDragon_Z> technically it'd be into her
[3:03:59] <%crimsonharvest> It seems like it'd kind of be a waste
[3:03:59] <faldin> Cs get degrees
[3:04:00] <Cypherblack> what if pat was like jax but just had two dildo arms?
[3:04:00] <awsomesaucekirby> no, a FLESH DILDO
[3:04:01] <LiquidMathew> Pat can't afford a good dildo arm
[3:04:01] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat it was confirmed after the success of Venom that it'll begin filming in February by i think Avi Arad, and Jared Leto has been set to play him for a few months
[3:04:03] <+Ell1ot> does Paige have a mic? i can hardly hear her
[3:04:04] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Pats hands are small LIKE a dildo
[3:04:04] <Worldbrand> Check a look
[3:04:05] <%ssjklyco> The higher your Rank, the more slashes on the screen
[3:04:05] <%Mornaka> What if it was a skeleton arm
[3:04:06] <CrypticMochi> Pat is immortal dildo arm
[3:04:06] <helpmeimafruit> How will Jared Leto method act for Morbius?
[3:04:09] <artoflec> WOODNT
[3:04:09] <%superorangerobin> How can this be
[3:04:09] <rytisone> but it vibrates
[3:04:09] <Zeikier> there you go-eth
[3:04:10] <TheyCallMeVawn> Pats been having a stroke all night
[3:04:11] <+TheRaveous> fools, it needs to have the vibration function
[3:04:11] <Graxe_> But at least DMC4 tells you the rough estimate of how many orbs you should get for each mission.
[3:04:12] <Your_Friendly_Futa> What if the Dildo transforms?
[3:04:12] <Doc1790> The Boss in this mission is pretty awkward to fight with Vergil
[3:04:13] <%Hilleltaco> There you go it apatWhat
[3:04:13] <Fujiwara_92> WHAT IF IT WAS A DICK
[3:04:13] <TheyCallMeVawn> I think its the red bull
[3:04:14] <prettypatties97> There you go it
[3:04:16] <+StrangeCoincidence> its a good thing you dont have to talk for a living
[3:04:17] <$RaikenTB> What's the point of the arm if you have to sacrifice your wife for it?
[3:04:20] <AlasterAngelo> this track is so good
[3:04:21] <$Niney_Who> What if you had GOmu Gomu powers but only for one arm
[3:04:23] <clonexsniperx> does imdb count as a credible source?
[3:04:25] <Plague_bagel> what if instead of a dildo arm it was just a plastic FIST
[3:04:27] <+jkobe34> you want blistering
[3:04:27] <faldin> You should only use silicone dildo arms
[3:04:27] <medril07> Pat have you seen Nero's banana arm?
[3:04:28] <+rei0> what if it came with a vibrate function tho?!
[3:04:32] <knomad2b> no pats dildo arm would spin like a drill
[3:04:38] <%Mornaka> @helpmeimafruit steal plasma from the red cross
[3:04:38] <IShadowStrykerI> "there you go it" and ''that's the do it' are now things
[3:04:39] <%Basch71> but you have those rubber fists tho Kappa
[3:04:40] <smevvster> Okay but what is it about Vergil that makes him so cool, like actually though.
[3:04:42] <Cypherblack> gurren lagann esque dildo arms only
[3:04:50] <HoIlywood_SN> @smevvster he has motivation
[3:04:52] <xxdj1173xx> Raffle
[3:04:53] <Your_Friendly_Futa> What if the Dildo Came mustard Paige?
[3:04:55] <+StrangeCoincidence> when you said dildo arm i was thinking of Parasyte: The Maxim
[3:04:56] <+Hamblasto> @angriestpat But, Paige, would you want Pat to have a dildo arm just to make his life miserable whenever he has to pick things up?
[3:04:56] <medril07> he missed the blue orb
[3:04:56] <$Niney_Who> @smevvster he's shadow the hedgehog
[3:04:58] <+twohitgood> a prosthetic hitachi would probably be more appealing.
[3:04:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> What if you could make your dick vibrate
[3:05:00] <knomad2b> pierce the heavens!
[3:05:01] <thebeatsandrhymes> @Cypherblack so Drills?
[3:05:01] <%JaydenSai> Nero's arm will pierce the heavens that is Kyrie's cooch
[3:05:03] <AlasterAngelo> @smevvster he has a sword
[3:05:03] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Will you suck on Pats Arm Dildo then?
[3:05:03] <+TheRaveous> is it just me or does vergil fall slower than the others?
[3:05:04] <Graxe_> Oh I get it. Sweet Surrender is a sex arm for Kyrie, but since it passively heals Nero, it also has him last longer or recover faster.
[3:05:07] <Cypherblack> YES
[3:05:13] <rytisone> time for fishy monters
[3:05:15] <thebeatsandrhymes> gnarly
[3:05:20] <medril07> PAT MISSED THE BLUE ORB
[3:05:20] <$mandragoraroot> SabaPing
[3:05:21] <gustavozxd> some pretty lame ass cutscenes
[3:05:23] <%Everpresent_Overseer> magic sharks
[3:05:29] <thebeatsandrhymes> wouldn't those be called Drilldos?
[3:05:33] <LiquidMathew> @smevvster Vergil is cool because he's the opposite of Dante, while also being Opposite of Nelo Angelo, thus increasing the coolness
[3:05:34] <+CaptainJax> pat you have to HIT THEM
[3:05:37] <itsya_boi_gappy> im so mad chat was right about the Morbius movie
[3:05:42] <+TheRaveous> bring out those sword circles babeh
[3:05:43] <gustavozxd> these fucking enemies
[3:05:45] <HyperBomb21> These are the worst enemies in the game
[3:05:46] <+Gorgodrn> Wonder if they had Daniel mocap them
[3:05:47] <gustavozxd> oh my god
[3:05:49] <+CaptainJax> YOU HAVE TO HIT THEM PAT
[3:05:54] <+potatodono_> are those street sharks?

[3:06:05] <medril07> upercuts
[3:06:07] <rytisone> they can be very annoying
[3:06:08] <Graxe_> Haven't fought these in a while.
[3:06:12] <Doc1790> These enemies were designed for Nero KappaRoss
[3:06:13] <$mandragoraroot> vineSchut
[3:06:31] <%SaltyDongs> uwah
[3:06:36] <+TheRaveous> round trip should work great on these guys
[3:06:38] <+Gorgodrn> All enemis were desgined for Nero... sadly
[3:06:47] <LiquidMathew> Losing Devil Bringer makes the switch to Dante so annoying
[3:06:53] <KahtaLzargo> Gnight
[3:06:55] <Doc1790> ^
[3:06:59] <StagNasty> @AngriestPat Have you seen the new weapons for Dante shown at NYCC?
[3:07:02] <helpmeimafruit> dmc4 seems to love enemies that you can't fucking hit because they're inside walls
[3:07:07] <awsomesaucekirby> Time for SKELTON WHEEL
[3:07:10] <+kullumanati> That’s the do it
[3:07:13] <Cypherblack> if vergil DT'd he'd pretty much look the same as dante in 5 right?
[3:07:18] <+CaptainJax> HAT GUN
[3:07:19] <TheyCallMeVawn> Have you seen Neros Monkey Business arm tho @AngriestPat
[3:07:19] <BritishBulldork> Hitting the Mephisto's finger stab lets you combo them normally for a while Pat, even with the cloak still on.
[3:07:26] <%SergeEXE> isn't this a time period BEFORE Virgil killed Beowulf?
[3:07:27] <StagNasty> Fuckin sick right?
[3:07:30] <medril07> this is why dmc3 is so much better
[3:07:34] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat That's because most enemies were designed with Nero in mind.
[3:07:39] <helpmeimafruit> DICE GAME TIME
[3:07:40] <gustavozxd> only weapon i haven't seen is cerberus and i'll keep it that way, sounds like it's really cool though
[3:07:40] <smevvster> Lmao have fun with the dice
[3:07:43] <rytisone> just like those Angels in dmc3, that everyone loves
[3:07:43] <bagheadlive> those guys in 3 who can go through walls are way worse
[3:07:44] <+Gorgodrn> @Cypherblack They've always been different from each other
[3:07:45] <%Hilleltaco> Oh boy board game time
[3:07:50] <$mandragoraroot> NotLikeThis the fuckin dice
[3:07:51] <$Niney_Who> I FOUND YOU, FAKER
[3:07:54] <LiquidMathew> @SergeEXE He also has Force Edge, don't think about it
[3:07:55] <%Hilleltaco> Magic demon board game room
[3:07:55] <prettypatties97> Enemies that I can't hit because they're in walls? You mean those fucking angel things from 3?
[3:07:56] <itsya_boi_gappy> the worst part of this game
[3:07:58] <+rei0> I never knew what the hell is this for
[3:07:58] <Doc1790> I'm glad they're bringing back some less complex enemies for DMC 5. Hopefully it'll balance everything out.
[3:07:59] <gustavozxd> worst fucking part in the game
[3:07:59] <%Everpresent_Overseer> yay a board game
[3:08:03] <Cypherblack> @Gorgodrn but their bodies are the same right? besides the sword arm sheathe
[3:08:03] <+CaptainJax> oh fuck do you have to do this without the buster trick?
[3:08:04] <bagheadlive> btw, is there a trick to making the dice land on what you want?
[3:08:08] <AsinineWaffle> Yes.
[3:08:08] <%jiin6> play your DnD
[3:08:09] <HoIlywood_SN> would Vergil ever actually bother with this shit
[3:08:12] <medril07> FAKER? YOU'RE THE FAKE HERE
[3:08:14] <Plague_bagel> wait vergil gives a shit about this? dante just says fuck it
[3:08:15] <Inebriateddonut> I think I'm the only person who actually kinda likes the dice
[3:08:23] <$Niney_Who> Lootbox time??
[3:08:28] <rytisone> you can totally cheese this dice part
[3:08:29] <%Divryne> MONEY.
[3:08:30] <BritishBulldork> yes, the trick is to just hit it while the number you want is on top.
[3:08:31] <%FairOnFire> there is a trick, just hit it when the number you want is facing up
[3:08:32] <%Everpresent_Overseer> We EA now
[3:08:34] <HoIlywood_SN> i liked the dice as an idea but it needed more thought put into it
[3:08:35] <gustavozxd> @bagheadlive you hit the dice so it lands on where you want to go, it works sometimes
[3:08:36] <LiquidMathew> there's a trick but i think it involves guns
[3:08:39] <%FairOnFire> super easy
[3:08:42] <TheyCallMeVawn> The dice game is the easiest
[3:08:45] <medril07> AFTER THJE TWO HIT FOR 6
[3:08:47] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat It's the one on top when you hit it
[3:08:52] <Royal8383> I always liked this game
[3:08:57] <%FairOnFire> they go in order
[3:08:59] <bagheadlive> this part is fine, it's the later part where it turns into a boss rush and the board loops
[3:09:01] <dekkitout> tf is this dungeon dice monsters chicanery?
[3:09:01] <+ChrisAlgoo> you hit it with the devil bringer and it comes up the same number
[3:09:03] <%ssjklyco> same as nero
[3:09:03] <medril07> it's always the same pattern
[3:09:03] <+imporia_> ?????

[3:09:23] <%SergeEXE> IT's even MORE youre FAULT
[3:09:24] <+Gorgodrn> @Cypherblack Their coat wings mimic their clothes and have different scale patterns, Plus the heads are different. Vergil also doesn't have the shiny chest
[3:09:26] <+imporia_> What were you counting to ???
[3:09:27] <StooEsq> Knock the die upwards, and it'll always be the number on top
[3:09:27] <Plague_bagel> pat can count strong
[3:09:27] <prettypatties97> 1 BIG 1
[3:09:28] <Worldbrand> you showed your work but wrote down the wrong number

[3:09:39] <bagheadlive> okay glad to know you can control the number because I've been playing these sections wrong
[3:09:40] <Estuko> Holy shit,"I see myself as the hero to my own story. I'm never wrong"
[3:09:40] <%Agami23> i left for a second and he is at this area. isnt this the boss rush??
[3:09:41] <HoIlywood_SN> PAT YOUR BRAIN IS RAPIDLY SHRINKING
[3:09:42] <prettypatties97> The biggest 1 it's ever been
[3:09:44] <nepwar> I miscounted so its really not my fault for evading my taxes
[3:09:47] <%Everpresent_Overseer> it's a "PERFECT" your fault
[3:09:49] <helpmeimafruit> Devil May Party when

[3:10:04] <Cypherblack> @Gorgodrn ahh okay i know their heads are different but i didnt know about the chest thing. im just going off memory from 3 and how their dts are pretty similar
[3:10:05] <bagheadlive> @Agami23 no that's the later part at the end of the game
[3:10:06] <Your_Friendly_Futa> I lauf
[3:10:11] <%Agami23> these guys are just the angel enemies but slightly better
[3:10:13] <Graxe_> What if Capcom made a DMC Mario Party game?
[3:10:13] <%jiin6> apatBig apatCrazyhand
[3:10:18] <medril07> mash triangle and sqaure together
[3:10:19] <Cypherblack> TWINZ
[3:10:27] <+TheRaveous> ever notice that these guys take regular damage if you attack them right after wacking away their attacks?
[3:10:34] <%Everpresent_Overseer> this is one of the reasons why Paige loves him, she doesn't have to worry about Math
[3:10:36] <Graxe_> Devil May Cry: Dante's Crazy Party
[3:10:53] <Zansatsu0379> I think the Zaibatsu should stream the new Mario Party cuz fuck it, ruin all the friendships with rng.
[3:11:01] <HoIlywood_SN> do you think a sidescrolling DMC could work?
[3:11:16] <helpmeimafruit> there have been lots of sidescrolling DMC-likes but they're usually not good
[3:11:22] <gustavozxd> It could work i think
[3:11:22] <DracaenaLeaf> yeah, lrn 2 count
[3:11:22] <$mandragoraroot> the zaibatsu are cowards and will not bring back best friends brawl
[3:11:24] <prettypatties97> On one hand that was stupid, on the other handand I also counted that as four so LUL
[3:11:24] <goroke> Aw man, does this stream means there's no DMC4 LP in the main channel
[3:11:24] <helpmeimafruit> NO
[3:11:24] <smevvster> NO
[3:11:25] <rytisone> Pat and Woolie should LP a gameboy game
[3:11:26] <Worldbrand> ?????
[3:11:26] <%SergeEXE> PAT
[3:11:27] <smevvster> NOT SIX
[3:11:32] <calder87> PAT NO

[3:11:39] <+rei0> pat please
[3:11:41] <+TheRaveous> A sidescrolling DMC is just marvel vs capcom 3 tbh lol
[3:11:43] <bagheadlive> @HoIlywood_SN Yes because there are some games like that, Dust: An elysin Tale, The Dish Washer series for example

[3:12:45] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Anything but 5
[3:12:47] <+DomunDomunDomun> Best part is Pat's counting right and just decides "Yeah I'll take the red one"
[3:12:48] <thebeatsandrhymes> anything but a 5 is good
[3:12:50] <Graxe_> Yellow is a shortcut, Pat. It teleports you to the yellow across from it.
[3:12:50] <medril07> after the two
[3:12:53] <nepwar> are you sure about that?
[3:12:56] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat i think your brain matter is leaking out
[3:12:57] <helpmeimafruit> Clap
[3:12:57] <Zeikier> hope you know how to fight Curry and Rice pat
[3:12:58] <Worldbrand> that was close
[3:13:00] <prettypatties97> Come on Crazy Talk, fuck his Shi up
[3:13:08] <Toast_Master_General> Pat tell Paige I say hi
[3:13:09] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Yellow is a skip
[3:13:10] <pineBBB> she slaps
[3:13:10] <bagheadlive> I actually wouldn't have minded this section if it was say, a bonus mini game like bloody palace
[3:13:10] <awsomesaucekirby> 2
[3:13:13] <medril07> 4
[3:13:13] <prettypatties97> Damn you
[3:13:16] <pineBBB> how can she slap
[3:13:20] <+Ryallen> Is this section optional? It looks really tedious for a mandatory section
[3:13:25] <AsinineWaffle> It's mandatory.
[3:13:25] <Cypherblack> HOW CAN SHE SLAP
[3:13:35] <Dragonfang1337> It's mandatory and you do it AGAIN later ResidentSleeper
[3:13:39] <awsomesaucekirby> go for blue
[3:13:42] <Graxe_> All dice game sections are mandatory.
[3:13:42] <rytisone> who designed this place?
[3:13:44] <%Hilleltaco> Mandatory but it doesn't take TOO long once you figure it out
[3:13:45] <bagheadlive> @Ryallen mandatory and you have to do it 3 more times
[3:13:51] <+Ryallen> Dear god\
[3:13:52] <%SaltyDongs> get 6
[3:13:53] <itsya_boi_gappy> @AngriestPat yo you see the Evil WIthin costume's in RE2 remake
[3:13:57] <StooEsq> "Dice scenes are SHIT." - Hideki Kamiya
[3:14:01] <Graxe_> Except for Dante. He just slices the die in half.

[3:14:20] <%Hilleltaco> YEAH FIGHT WINDOW
[3:14:25] <Graxe_> The cutscene even calls what Dante does "The Cheat".
[3:14:27] <Flyrant> Pat gonna do some sick perfect judgment cut cancels?
[3:14:30] <$mandragoraroot> NotLikeThis this boss
[3:14:31] <HoIlywood_SN> oh yeah apparently this guy is Nicos dad or some shit

[3:14:36] <%SergeEXE> HI NICO'S DAD
[3:14:36] <gustavozxd> god this fucking boss
[3:14:42] <+TheRaveous> WOW REALLY?
[3:14:44] <HoIlywood_SN> THIS GUY, THIS FUCKING GUY HAD SEX WITH SOMEBODY
[3:14:48] <%Fenrirlives> IS NICO PAPA
[3:14:49] <Your_Friendly_Futa> this is so much easier now
[3:14:49] <medril07> they don't usually blam in the window when you're nero
[3:14:53] <HoIlywood_SN> THIS FUCKING WEIRD FREAK GOT HIS DICK WET SOMEHOW
[3:15:00] <%ssjklyco> I love that you can see Yamato in the back as well.
[3:15:01] <42nfl19> "How does it feel to rescue the guy who killed your dad?"
[3:15:06] <%Divryne> Hi Nico's dad.
[3:15:07] <medril07> might have to dt
[3:15:07] <+TheRaveous> agnus fucks guys
[3:15:08] <Flyrant> @AngriestPat you can just attack the glass
[3:15:09] <HoIlywood_SN> BOTH CHARACTERS ON SCREEN SOMEHOW GOT LAID
[3:15:09] <$mandragoraroot> hes nicos dad? NotLikeThis
[3:15:10] <+TheRaveous> deal with it
[3:15:11] <+rei0> oh yeah, no guns to stay on air either huh
[3:15:18] <SeventyForce> ya don't need no sex for babbies
[3:15:20] <Your_Friendly_Futa> WHAT, HOW DID HE GET LAID?
[3:15:20] <gustavozxd> wait he's Nico's dad?
[3:15:25] <bagheadlive> I mean, Mico's dad could be someone who got killed by Dante off screen, it's not like Nico's skin color is the same as Nicos
[3:15:28] <+cabooseteamkill> shoot the glass
[3:15:28] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Wait, he probably didnt get laid
[3:15:33] <helpmeimafruit> no he got laid
[3:15:34] <Graxe_> You can just attack the glass, but it's faster if you hit the Gladii.
[3:15:39] <%Afterman_> how many evil geniuses has dante killed?
[3:15:41] <Doc1790> Yep. This Boss is really bad with Vergil.
[3:15:43] <+kukadin> I don't remember this at all
[3:15:45] <HoIlywood_SN> THIS FUCKING FREAK NERD BLASTED INSIDE SOME CHICK SOMEHOW
[3:15:45] <Graxe_> Still not great either way.
[3:15:46] <%Afterman_> because that was a descriptor
[3:15:47] <+BlackMage66652> Patrick is lacking in motivation
[3:15:53] <gustavozxd> what is this headcanon i'm hearing about
[3:15:54] <rytisone> Yamato is right behind the glass
[3:15:56] <awsomesaucekirby> looks fine
[3:15:57] <pineBBB> this game slaps
[3:15:59] <itsya_boi_gappy> chat missing the point that his mom made E&I for dante
[3:16:05] <stropbopadopolis> so is dmc 4 not going to be LP on the channel?
[3:16:07] <+imextremelymanly> just ignore the adds and attack the window
[3:16:10] <Your_Friendly_Futa> For him, it kinda seems more likely that he kidnapped a girl and forced a baby in her
[3:16:11] <+fugatlas> How are you supposed to do this fight without devil bringer
[3:16:14] <+Gorgodrn> Apparently, based on the novels, Agnus hated women. But it is pretty clear that he is her father.
[3:16:29] <Flyrant> Pat just hit the glass yourself NotLikeThis
[3:16:31] <medril07> can't you jump an attack?
[3:16:32] <gustavozxd> clear where
[3:16:35] <bagheadlive> @stropbopadopolis Pat as hinted at a SBFP LP of DMC4's main campaign in the stream
[3:16:36] <awsomesaucekirby> lookmat these pokemon
[3:16:44] <+dnajones> "This is terrible" as he's beating the boss no problem at all
[3:16:45] <Your_Friendly_Futa> @Flyrant You cant do that
[3:16:46] <LixFury> who's father?
[3:16:46] <OldOnyx> Now I'm starting remember why I didn't play much as anyone other Nero when given the chance
[3:16:46] <+imextremelymanly> you can you dont need to hit the sword
[3:16:50] <helpmeimafruit> Agnus's mom made E&I for Dante and Agnus was killed by Dante with E&I. It's like poetry, it rhymes.
[3:16:50] <SeventyForce> Nico might be a experiment with he's own DNA
[3:16:55] <Flyrant> @Your_Friendly_Futa yes you can
[3:16:56] <bagheadlive> @Gorgodrn I mean, they have completely different skin tones?
[3:17:02] <prettypatties97> Pat, was the boss as bad as it looked? Or was it worse?
[3:17:09] <LiquidMathew> no wonder Vergil steals the Devil Bringer
[3:17:10] <%Afterman_> a japanese dmc twitter posted a description of nico, mentions her dad was killed by dante and was an evil genius
[3:17:10] <%Hilleltaco> @dnajones It's not that it's hard, it's just not a good boss
[3:17:12] <thebeatsandrhymes> worse
[3:17:15] <+Gorgodrn> @bagheadlive She has a mother too, you know.
[3:17:19] <%Divryne> I seriously hope this doesn't happen in DMC5.
[3:17:24] <+rei0> that boss was easier on nero cuz snatch
[3:17:24] <medril07> pat you missed the blue orb at the start
[3:17:31] <gustavozxd> oh yeah her grandmother
[3:17:39] <+imextremelymanly> you can just attack the barrier
[3:17:40] <gustavozxd> goddamn side stories
[3:17:41] <Doc1790> @AngriestPat I did that Boss on Son of Sparda Mode with Vergil and died like 4 times straight.
[3:17:42] <bagheadlive> sure but she's not half cast, she's pretty white looking, especially if you look up her face model
[3:17:43] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat did you hear about Agnus being Nicos dad
[3:17:52] <itsya_boi_gappy> i tihnk thats an issue with this whole game is that it was made for nero
[3:17:52] <medril07> yeah Nero's dirty snatch saved his life haha
[3:17:53] <awsomesaucekirby> NICE PAT
[3:17:54] <frozenwaifu> lol
[3:17:59] <helpmeimafruit> Does it bother anyone else that Dante just straight up caps Agnus, a human, in the head after they have their Shakespearean bonding moment?
[3:17:59] <Flyrant> Why do you think the glass turns yellow when the floor get electrified, to knock you off of it if you're attacking it.
[3:18:00] <+fugatlas> Don’t you need pandora for this one
[3:18:01] <rytisone> Itsuno is like "Gimme a break, I was gathering money for 5"
[3:18:03] <$mandragoraroot> get air trick
[3:18:12] <startadevy> OK PAT
[3:18:14] <SWFanatic> this is like assassins creed camera work
[3:18:15] <startadevy> that is it
[3:18:15] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Aiiiir tricks
[3:18:16] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat what do you think Agnus' o-face looks like
[3:18:17] <+TheRaveous> just use trickster Kappa
[3:18:22] <+imextremelymanly> do you have double jump
[3:18:22] <pomki20> just air hike
[3:18:24] <%mister___doctor> Agnis is mh le as
[3:18:27] <medril07> this is a hard one to get
[3:18:30] <BritishBulldork> you can do it with streak and air hike, so you can probably do it with Vergil.
[3:18:32] <%XzileGaming> night Pat and chat
[3:18:37] <%mister___doctor> Agnis is my least favorite DMC character
[3:18:39] <+BlackMage66652> @AngriestPat Where's your motivation?
[3:18:40] <%ssjklyco> Just shoot
[3:18:40] <SchroedingersFerret> You need the timestop
[3:18:41] <Mattmandx1> @helpmeimafruit Agnes turned into a bug demon though
[3:18:41] <bagheadlive> @helpmeimafruit isn't agnus technically no longer human? which was Dante's point in his speech i think
[3:18:44] <Your_Friendly_Futa> WHAT?
[3:18:44] <Jaxiis0> nice
[3:18:46] <medril07> what? how?
[3:18:48] <+cabooseteamkill> oh
[3:18:50] <frozenwaifu> ????
[3:18:53] <+TheImmortal70> Swords don't have a range
[3:18:55] <prettypatties97> night xzile
[3:18:56] <%Hilleltaco> Summon swords pick stuff up
[3:18:56] <+TheImmortal70> The devil bringer does
[3:19:14] <%mister___doctor> Agnes is just discount Jester
[3:19:16] <$mandragoraroot> oh wow
[3:19:22] <Flyrant> Patrick, I'm expecting perfect judgment cut cancels
[3:19:23] <HoIlywood_SN> how long after DMC4 is DMC5 and how old is Agnus here
[3:19:33] <helpmeimafruit> Agnus is a corpse
[3:19:38] <HoIlywood_SN> well yeah i know
[3:19:39] <medril07> it's flying demon glass that breaks on impact how can it pick up anything?
[3:19:40] <+StrangeCoincidence> the time has come and so have I
[3:19:40] <itsya_boi_gappy> LUL
[3:19:41] <helpmeimafruit> oh
[3:19:42] <helpmeimafruit> i misread
[3:19:47] <LiquidMathew> I can find nothing on Agnus and Nico being related
[3:19:48] <rytisone> secret mission missed
[3:19:56] <bagheadlive> @HoIlywood_SN Well DMC2 is set after 4 and DMC 5 is set after 2, it's complicated lol
[3:19:58] <%Fenrirlives> The Shakespeare Scene justifies Agnus' existence
[3:19:59] <%Hilleltaco> I think we can all agree that Dante's cutscene with Agnus is great though
[3:20:04] <medril07> back at the corpses
[3:20:06] <%Mornaka> @medril07 the same way links boomerang does
[3:20:07] <$Dotta5> held captive by swirling piss demons
[3:20:09] <Inebriateddonut> Back at the test tube dudes
[3:20:09] <Graxe_> Back with the bodies getting their souls sucked out.
[3:20:11] <pomki20> by the three glowing corpses @AngriestPat
[3:20:15] <rytisone> behind soul sucked guys
[3:20:17] <+rei0> yes you did, it's near the 3 lab experiment down there
[3:20:18] <+StrangeCoincidence> Pat how do I get rid of a zit?
[3:20:18] <%Fenrirlives> YAMATOOOOO
[3:20:20] <BritishBulldork> Back with the people who are being "something'd"
[3:20:22] <%Fenrirlives> THAT IS WHAT YOU SEEK
[3:20:25] <+TheRaveous> @LiquidMathew it's apparently from nico's dialogue in DMC5
[3:20:32] <%Fenrirlives> AND THAT IS WHY I STAND IN YOUR PAAAAATH
[3:20:32] <medril07> ha
[3:20:33] <helpmeimafruit> IS SANITY
[3:20:35] <HoIlywood_SN> @LiquidMathew there was a press release on the characters back at E3 saying her dad as a mad scientist and Capcom showed off the DMC5 intro where Nico and Nero have lines that very fuckin heavily imply its him
[3:20:36] <helpmeimafruit> THE PRICE TO PAY
[3:20:37] <+StrangeCoincidence> that enemy looks like guyver
[3:20:37] <+Gorgodrn> @HoIlywood_SN Pretty sure no exact numbers have been revealed. They only said years. And it's set after 2 as well. Itsuno said that they didn't say it directly because the story of DMC4 is more relevant to 5. So there's that
[3:20:49] <medril07> try to taunt, get smacked with a shield
[3:20:54] <%Hilleltaco> FOR POWER?
[3:21:03] <+ChrisAlgoo> its so funny when vergil does his cool guy taunt and gets hit
[3:21:11] <helpmeimafruit> how do you even do this without Nero's spider sense
[3:21:15] <rosabellamelantha> you dont
[3:21:16] <+rei0> oh man, how does pat do this without nero lol
[3:21:17] <Graxe_> I hope you have the locations memorized or have a guide with you.
[3:21:19] <pomki20> this secret mission's for nero
[3:21:22] <+TheRaveous> THIS IS A BAD ONE
[3:21:24] <medril07> places it makes the noise have hidden orbs
[3:21:24] <rytisone> Nero's devil arm would be very usefull right not
[3:21:27] <$mandragoraroot> this is the one that person asked you aboit
[3:21:30] <SWFanatic> is this anor londo?
[3:21:32] <Flyrant> so will Woolie be doing guard fly combos when you play this on the channel?
[3:21:34] <Graxe_> Everyone can do it, but Nero's the only one who has the sense.
[3:21:38] <KaiserMario> Stand still in certain spots
[3:21:42] <medril07> need nero's detectot
[3:21:45] <helpmeimafruit> japed
[3:21:45] <Ravendusk> This is probably easier with Nero
[3:21:52] <42nfl19> Does Vergil at least get an upgrade to get the sensor?
[3:21:53] <+BlackMage66652> Do it perfect tho
[3:21:55] <pomki20> easier with Nero's detector
[3:22:02] <Graxe_> So if you know the spots, anyone can do it. If you don't, then good luck.
[3:22:03] <$mandragoraroot> m6kwLukeno
[3:22:04] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat use Vergils detector
[3:22:05] <rytisone> made for Nero
[3:22:06] <LiquidMathew> Vergil stealing the Devil Bringer makes more and more sense
[3:22:07] <+StrangeCoincidence> ask paige to do it for you
[3:22:09] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Your meant to stand still up on those ledges
[3:22:10] <$hatesdps> steal your sons arm to find collectibles
[3:22:11] <gustavozxd> the point is, you can't do it right now
[3:22:14] <prettypatties97> Just style switch into Nero
[3:22:21] <+ChrisAlgoo> this song slaps tho
[3:22:21] <Flyrant> this pretty much requires Nero
[3:22:25] <%ssjklyco> This one is impossible with this character
[3:22:26] <frozenwaifu> LOL
[3:22:27] <+TheRaveous> this is practically impossible with vergil because the spawns are random each time
[3:22:27] <+imextremelymanly> forgetaboutit
[3:22:28] <medril07> how was the bael fight?
[3:22:29] <+Timesteel> LUL
[3:22:31] <Ravendusk> Style switch into Nero's cut off arm
[3:22:38] <Zeikier> let Elmo do it, he's clearly the Character Action Game savant
[3:22:39] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat You have to stand still on certain spots
[3:22:42] <42nfl19> Wait are blue orbs shared between character runs?
[3:22:46] <%ssjklyco> Paige would break it
[3:22:53] <medril07> it's almost like he's been dead for twenty years
[3:22:55] <TechDragon_Z> Did you like how DmC Vergil played?
[3:22:56] <rytisone> just bring impregnated woman and look if her belly shines
[3:22:58] <+cabooseteamkill> one of vergil's best qualities is his ability to cancel the recovery of nearly any move into teleport.
[3:22:58] <+Gorgodrn> Same goes for Dante tbh.
[3:22:58] <$Dotta5> cheer200 couple-a bevies with the boys
[3:23:04] <VHLW> its a shame the game got so rushed
[3:23:08] <Flyrant> Vergil is busted as fuck, what are you on about?
[3:23:08] <bagheadlive> yeah it's pretty obvious Lady, Trish & Vergil were just dumped into the base version of DMC4, it's basically a mod
[3:23:10] <gustavozxd> DmC vergil is the worst
[3:23:18] <+TheRaveous> when you get your full moveset, the game will become a lot easier
[3:23:19] <LiquidMathew> I think they are only shared between campaigns, Nero/Dante, Vergil, Lady/Trish
[3:23:22] <+StrangeCoincidence> pat do you like botchamania?
[3:23:23] <+BlackMage66652> Style switch into Nero's mom
[3:23:33] <%ssjklyco> Use Beowulf on them
[3:23:34] <Flyrant> Vergil basically walks through this game
[3:23:34] <+Gorgodrn> DMC5 seems promising in that regard.
[3:23:38] <Graxe_> Orbs, health, DT, and proud souls are shared. You still have to buy stuff for each character.
[3:23:39] <+StrangeCoincidence> I can't believe people don't like Nero
[3:23:42] <helpmeimafruit> Is Vergil's dong nicknamed Yamato or Darkslayer?
[3:23:44] <ghostravens> how does lady play in this game?
[3:23:46] <LiquidMathew> just do bloody palace then? see how far you can get
[3:23:49] <medril07> so no lp of this for the channel?
[3:23:51] <%FairOnFire> Vergil is so easy mode
[3:23:54] <AlasterAngelo> people don't like nero because he was a weiner not because of his gameplay
[3:24:00] <+StrangeCoincidence> NERO OWNS
[3:24:06] <+StrangeCoincidence> ITS GOOD THAT HE'S A WEENIE
[3:24:07] <cherubsanonymous> Those people are dumb and stupid and eat bad cheese
[3:24:10] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> He's Nero to my Hearto
[3:24:11] <TheyCallMeVawn> I honestly have the most fun playing Nero. Snatch and his buster are so fucking good.
[3:24:11] <+ChrisAlgoo> i tried playing dmc and vergils downfall a few weeks ago. its bad and flaccid but i think they respected the old dmc games a lot. like, the achievement names are usually lines from past games
[3:24:12] <helpmeimafruit> Nero is Raiden if Raiden was Revengeance Raiden in MGR:R
[3:24:13] <Flyrant> pat isn't using summoned swords is the problem
[3:24:14] <TheyCallMeVawn> And his combos are really fun.
[3:24:14] <%Mornaka> I didn't when i first got the game, but by the end i loved him the most
[3:24:15] <Inebriateddonut> I think it was just the Raiden effect
[3:24:15] <helpmeimafruit> I mean MGS2
[3:24:17] <+BlackMage66652> boing
[3:24:17] <+TheRaveous> people don't like him I feel mainly because of the MGS2-esque switch of main characters in this game
[3:24:19] <%Divryne> People don't like Nero cause they wanna get to play Dante first.
[3:24:23] <+imextremelymanly> Nero is the raiden of DMC
[3:24:25] <HoIlywood_SN> Nero was cool in DMC4 but he looks cooler in DMC5
[3:24:26] <gustavozxd> nero cries like twice in the game what are you guys talking about
[3:24:26] <+Gorgodrn> And he was a visual Dante clone to many. That's why I'm both glad and surprised they complain as well with the design change
[3:24:28] <bagheadlive> The original concept of Nero being a sherlock holmes style detective sounded so cool
[3:24:28] <Warbot40> It was a MGS2 raiden situation
[3:24:29] <%jiin6> Nero's alright, his got one good move set and its alright
[3:24:29] <Mattmandx1> Nero is too tricky for me to use his sword effectively. Devil Bringer is cool though
[3:24:31] <$Dotta5> Are cheers broke?
[3:24:32] <calder87> he looks more interesting as a character in 5 than in 4. wet blanketing all over the places after kyrie, who's basically a cardboard cutout....
[3:24:37] <cherubsanonymous> @ChrisAlgoo They did NOT respect the original series at all
[3:24:45] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat It's very clear they designed the game around Nero and didn't have the time for much else... Even though the characters movesets are fully realized, the game doesn't suit them...
[3:24:46] <medril07> he's fine. I just hate the game expects you to devil arm everything instead or crazy combo
[3:24:47] <TheyCallMeVawn> I think the whole arm system in V is really going to flesh out his gameplay. I cant wait.
[3:24:49] <LiquidMathew> Ironically I started on dmc4 and mgs2 so I liked both characters from the start
[3:24:49] <rytisone> people didnt like him because he was Dante's rip off. He has more distinctive look in 5
[3:24:50] <thebeatsandrhymes> plus he has RED QUEEN
[3:24:51] <+rei0> nero trigger hits is hard as ball to time
[3:24:51] <42nfl19> The one thing I dislike about nero is that to use grab, you have to de-lock from an enemy or you use snatch instead.
[3:24:52] <$mandragoraroot> i like the term raiden effect
[3:24:55] <thebeatsandrhymes> THE RADDEST WEAPON IN DMC
[3:24:57] <+SuichiTanaka> Nero's ability to counter boss attacks is the fucking coolest
[3:25:03] <bagheadlive> I hope Kyrie actually has a personality in DMC5
[3:25:07] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat remember when Raiden was cooler than Dante for a few years
[3:25:07] <Your_Friendly_Futa> But then Dante comes in with his Style Switching
[3:25:08] <helpmeimafruit> Would Donte have been well received if he was a different character in mainline DMC that got shit on all the time by Dante?
[3:25:12] <itsya_boi_gappy> i agree nero gets too much hate
[3:25:14] <Royal8383> Nero's playstyle is awesome
[3:25:14] <%jiin6> i never mastered Dante...the styles kinda turned me off him
[3:25:16] <+imextremelymanly> who made red queen
[3:25:16] <+ChrisAlgoo> definitely not in a gameplay sense! maybe there was one writer who was a secret fan
[3:25:23] <gustavozxd> nero can grab those credo spears and throw them back it's sick as fuck
[3:25:25] <%JaydenSai> @AngriestPat I like Red Queen over Rebellion any day
[3:25:27] <+BlackMage66652> Devil May Cry 4: Vergil Cowards Out
[3:25:29] <LiquidMathew> @bagheadlive I just hope she's onscreen, totally expect her to just be a voice offscreen
[3:25:30] <+StrangeCoincidence> rising vs dmc
[3:25:34] <rytisone> back when DmC came out
[3:25:36] <AlasterAngelo> Rising vs DmC
[3:25:38] <cherubsanonymous> She's wrong
[3:25:38] <TheyCallMeVawn> Metal Gear Rising sequel when
[3:25:38] <HyperBomb21> "I dont even care." - Me when i play through this game. DMC4 is just boring compared to 3
[3:25:41] <AlasterAngelo> it was so weird
[3:25:43] <medril07> DOKTOR! TURN OFF MY PAIN INHIBITORS!
[3:25:45] <itsya_boi_gappy> tell her to catch these hands
[3:25:45] <%Superstarsage> I don't know why, he's literally an exoskeleton
[3:25:48] <+Sinister_Aglet> Raiden isn't cool in rising, he's just an edgelord
[3:25:51] <deadshot27> Paige hates fun
[3:25:52] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Gay Cowboy Vs Mexican Cyborg, who wins?
[3:25:53] <Warbot40> Nero also looked EXTREMELY similar to Dante in this so that probably didn't help
[3:25:53] <prettypatties97> DmC: Devil May Snipe Babies
[3:25:53] <Flyrant> Max Act is an amazing mechanic, but I wish Nero had one more weapon
[3:25:55] <%FairOnFire> don't you "eh" peach
[3:25:57] <bagheadlive> @LiquidMathew I feel like the E3 reveal trailer implies she'll be visible at some point
[3:25:57] <KaiserMario> Sam is cooler than everyone else
[3:25:57] <LiquidMathew> But Paige! Raiden is a cyborg which is basically a metal skeleton!
[3:25:59] <pomki20> who do you prefer, Dante or Vergil?
[3:26:03] <TheBlankAce> You can't just eh Raiden, he asks Sunny if Otacon fucks
[3:26:13] <%Atomik456> Well yeah if she liked hyper emotional pretty boys she wouldn't be here would she?
[3:26:14] <+Gorgodrn> @Flyrant That's why they gave him Breakers
[3:26:20] <+TheRaveous> Funny, when I played for the first time, I remembered preferring nero over Dante. Now I prefer Dante over Nero because at the end of the day, Dante's full moveset 100% utilized >>>>> Nero
[3:26:21] <%jiin6> does paige hate the Watermelon cutting raiden?
[3:26:24] <cherubsanonymous> And Nero over both
[3:26:24] <HyperBomb21> Nero himself is 4's redeeming quality
[3:26:31] <Flyrant> @Gorgodrn yeah he looks great in 5
[3:26:34] <rytisone> night and day switches so fast in dmc world
[3:26:36] <IShadowStrykerI> who wins in a fight Vergil or yang.. answer: neither cause theyre both dead
[3:26:40] <SWFanatic> Goodnight Elmo
[3:26:41] <gustavozxd> say that again after playing dante LUL
[3:26:43] <+Gorgodrn> @TheRaveous Yeah, but mastering Dante is a different monster
[3:26:51] <+imextremelymanly> `I really hope the orb collection is gone from rank in fice
[3:26:54] <helpmeimafruit> @AngriestPat How do you guys feel about 1 of the 5 youtubers that recognized Nero in the first DMC5 trailer?
[3:26:54] <LiquidMathew> the Blitz are the worst as not Nero
[3:27:04] <+imporia_> HE RISES
[3:27:04] <medril07> yeah but just get good pat
[3:27:04] <fimbulvetr27> Vergil's just got a weird learning curve
[3:27:04] <+StrangeCoincidence> Metal Gear Elmo: Rising
[3:27:05] <+rei0> dante can at least do stuff around it
[3:27:08] <bagheadlive> @imextremelymanly I'm pretty sure it's still there
[3:27:09] <%FairOnFire> nobody requires the grab dude. vergil destroys everything
[3:27:11] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Dantes campaign works because he has his guns
[3:27:13] <Zeikier> Elmo Gear Rising: ReStinky
[3:27:15] <IceCreamAndAHug> @AngriestPat ive never gotten into DMC but with 5 coming out soon, its peaked my interest. is dante more of a doom guy whos just into killing demons or some nerd
[3:27:15] <gustavozxd> even as nero blitz is not fun
[3:27:17] <TheyCallMeVawn> Pat made me proud when he recognized Nero
[3:27:19] <$mandragoraroot> elmo gear rising
[3:27:21] <Flyrant> you aren't using most of vergil's moveset like his summoned swords at all
[3:27:24] <medril07> it wasn't dante that's for sure
[3:27:26] <%JaydenSai> @AngriestPat Red Queen or Rebellion?
[3:27:28] <Graxe_> The summoned sword formations are his ways around enemies that require Buster and Snatch, basically.
[3:27:30] <Your_Friendly_Futa> He lies
[3:27:30] <Bouldus> nope
[3:27:32] <KaiserMario> No, Max was
[3:27:33] <Bouldus> not people
[3:27:35] <%jiin6> Suuuure he was
[3:27:35] <rytisone> I first thought it was Nero's son
[3:27:36] <%Hilleltaco> I got scared because of the hair for a second but then the red queen moves started happening
[3:27:38] <zal_silverfang> yeah. kinda wish we did DQ11 now. though this was worth the bumbling and easy mode
[3:27:38] <+BlackMage66652> Elmo May Cry
[3:27:38] <+Gorgodrn> Since Urizen was shown, the art style creamed DMC
[3:27:39] <thebeatsandrhymes> I thought it was DmC Devil May Cry 2 for a second
[3:27:40] <Zeikier> I saw devil triggers on fire on the belt of Dante
[3:27:41] <42nfl19> Just be a cool guy @AngriestPat and slowly walk up to your enemies.
[3:27:41] <%Divryne> Angry Joe who claims to be a hardcore DMC fan fucking thought Nero was Dante.
[3:27:43] <+DomunDomunDomun> Elmo rising: revengeance
[3:27:43] <$rdark_ksu> its pronounced earf
[3:27:45] <$mandragoraroot> i knew before nero even showed up
[3:27:47] <prettypatties97> 1 of 5 youtubers recognized Nero, and 3 of them were the Best Friends
[3:27:49] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat imagine a Devil May Cry spin-off where you play as Nero but its also like a Yakuza game
[3:27:50] <Admiral_PopnFresh> SHARE
[3:27:50] <medril07> people were afreaid it was dmc dante
[3:27:51] <ragasquid> I want that shirt
[3:27:51] <thebeatsandrhymes> then it looked cool and I went "OH SHIT THAT'S DMC5
[3:27:51] <Zeikier> I had a customer the other day with their dog in a stroller
[3:27:51] <pomki20> Rebellion, Alastor or Force Edge
[3:27:51] <+imextremelymanly> Orbs are such a hindrance on ranking
[3:27:57] <calder87> you can play as one of those in overcooked, can't you
[3:27:58] <frozenwaifu> get a bulldob
[3:28:00] <gustavozxd> it was so obvious it was nero
[3:28:02] <Graxe_> Blistering Swords and Storm Swords tear through Mephisto and Faust cloatks.
[3:28:03] <TheyCallMeVawn> Hasnt Angry Joe only played DmC lol
[3:28:03] <AlasterAngelo> frustrated ferdinand
[3:28:04] <frozenwaifu> yes a bulldob
[3:28:06] <Your_Friendly_Futa> Shake the baby

[3:28:11] <gustavozxd> his voice, his sword, his gun, done
[3:28:11] <+BlackMage66652> Elmo May Cry 3: Special Edition
[3:28:11] <arkv01> father feed me
[3:28:12] <+imporia_> Actually some of the devs were surprised too, not until they watched your reaction did they realize they had been working on nero, they thought it was just some weird short hair dante outfit
[3:28:22] <%bloodypurpledog> Shake the baby to annoy it
[3:28:23] <Worldbrand> I want the feet half
[3:28:24] <medril07> Pat are you going to play fist of the north yakuza?
[3:28:25] <gustavozxd> he revs the red queen in the first fucking minute ffs
[3:28:26] <bagheadlive> that VG247 is still salty they thought Nero was Dante
[3:28:29] <faldin> Yeah well angry joe ain’t the brightest
[3:28:35] <+Bupkis7> You find a twice disabled dog cute?
[3:28:37] <gustavozxd> and how the hell can you not recognize Jhonny
[3:28:52] <+xXichibanballer> if you're having trouble as vergil, just try pressing all of the buttons at the same time all the time
[3:28:53] <AlasterAngelo> the black power ranger
[3:29:03] <HoIlywood_SN> @bagheadlive the guy who fucked that up recently met with Matt and Itsuno and tried to get them to shit talk the audience for yelling at him for being wrong and Matt immediately started shitting on him
[3:29:04] <%SergeEXE> FALSE

[3:30:18] <gustavozxd> @hoilywood_sn they learned well with DmC to NOT EVER shit talk fans, they're not even shit talking DmC, it's crazy
[3:30:20] <%bloodypurpledog> She was made like a loaf of bread
[3:30:20] <Inebriateddonut> What the heck does "too inside baseball" even mean?
[3:30:21] <$Dotta5> genitalia enhanced
[3:30:22] <+PenmanLupine> is Skelmo talking?
[3:30:22] <+BlackMage66652> The test tube gave her lupus
[3:30:23] <$SGrim> Test tube baby born to research Lupis! rooPog
[3:30:23] <%commanderclaw> Tiddies is more important than Lupus
[3:30:23] <+redstonej> ew
[3:30:23] <AlasterAngelo> hey man gotta make money somehow. turkey basters gotta feed their families too
[3:30:25] <+kullumanati> Have we donated money for Pat’s stolen cookie dough

[3:30:43] <arkv01> pat, too, will evolve into a turkey bastere
[3:30:48] <bagheadlive> to be fair, there's no need to shit talk DmC, the only issue with DmC is it had to be a Devil May Cry game
[3:30:51] <prettypatties97> Golden and Labrador retrievers are top tier dogs
[3:30:52] <%Fenrirlives> @HoIlywood_SN is there any footage of that?

[3:32:18] <arkv01> guess dmc4 is off the list boys
[3:32:19] <Doc1790> lmao
[3:32:20] <+Sinister_Aglet> More Dragon Quest!
[3:32:20] <medril07> PAT THE CRIPPLE WORF EP IS ON
[3:32:20] <%Afterman_> odyssey!
[3:32:20] <NopeBadguy> PLAY FIST OF THE NORTH STAR
[3:32:21] <Your_Friendly_Futa> EZ MODE
[3:32:24] <%ssjklyco> Coward
[3:32:25] <wsintai> @AngriestPat Play Dragon Quest nerd
[3:32:25] <Bouldus> HAH
[3:32:25] <%jiin6> put it on booo
[3:32:27] <+tigerfang86> GOT EM
[3:32:27] <LiquidMathew> its that Vergil isn't as fun as in 3
[3:32:27] <Bouldus> FUCK
[3:32:28] <TheBlankAce> Paige doesn't get it
[3:32:30] <arkv01> YEAH ACTUALLY WHENS HOKUTO
[3:32:31] <frozenwaifu> booooo
[3:32:32] <Bouldus> that self burn
[3:32:33] <rytisone> play Vergil in dmc3
[3:32:33] <%jiin6> OH NOO
[3:32:35] <calder87> I actually still have my original game boy and games... let's see what's in there: super mario land, various pokemon, game boy camera (lol), donkey kong land 2, Link's Awakening, POKEMON TRADING CARD GAME! THAT BOSS THEME WAS THE SHIT
[3:32:36] <prettypatties97> I guess DMC was garbage all along Kappa
[3:32:37] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Is Yang still dead
[3:32:38] <ZippyPsycho> EASY MODE IS NOW SELECTABLE
[3:32:38] <+PenmanLupine> pat would've been in hard mode tho
[3:32:40] <+Bupkis7> DRAGON QUEST
[3:32:40] <bagheadlive> @AlasterAngelo Sure but a lot of those issues can be traced back to the game having to be a DMC reboot, how Capcom made Ninja Theory dramatically change Dante then try to reign it back after the reveal, wouldn't have happened if it wasn't DMC
[3:32:41] <medril07> It's on now in australia
[3:32:42] <Flyrant> I'm kinda baffled Pat is saying Vergil isn't suited for these enemies. Vergil is so fuckin busted he literally just blows enemies up
[3:32:44] <+xXichibanballer> pat needs to perfect his judgement cuts
[3:32:47] <42nfl19> "More like Paige is easy, BOOM."
[3:32:50] <Doc1790> Pat I beat this on Son of Sparda. You don't even know what the meaning of suffer is.
[3:32:59] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat I will gift Paige Dragon's Dogma pat
[3:33:04] <Bouldus> @42nfl19 yea, thats what she said?
[3:33:06] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 Go watch "BID DUEL" 19 seconds of succinct yugioh
[3:33:06] <IShadowStrykerI> why not speed up sumond swords
[3:33:08] <%Hilleltaco> Vergil's later summon sword upgrades melt those enemies, way faster than Nero
[3:33:11] <ketchuo13> Judgement Cuts really makes those enemies easier, and Lady just chews through them
[3:33:11] <cherubsanonymous> WOW
[3:33:13] <%Fenrirlives> PLAY FINAL FANTASY WOMAN
[3:33:16] <+rei0> thanks for stream Pat, night
[3:33:17] <Graxe_> A good chunk of Vergil's way of dealing with enemies are with Summoned Swords and their formations.
[3:33:19] <+sindrantz> when is later
[3:33:20] <$rdark_ksu> ah I miss you Paige
[3:33:22] <%Fenrirlives> I BEG OF YOU
