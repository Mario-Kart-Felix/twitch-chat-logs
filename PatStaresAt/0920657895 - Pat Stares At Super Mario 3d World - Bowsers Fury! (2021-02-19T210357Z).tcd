[0:31:27] <%coreyyotto> IT's two quarter-pound patties
[0:31:27] <%MisterRockett> It's cause people think 1/2 is less meat than 1/4th. Not joking that ACTUALLY happened when they advertised it as a 1/2 pounder.
[0:31:28] <Aydarkzero> this is fast food we're talking about Math has no place there

[0:31:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's about the contents, not the weight

[0:41:28] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Actual adults can just access hentai without getting in trouble with their parents, so the ones who shit themselves online over characters being more dressed are kids and lunatics

[0:42:19] <+BIumen> 2B doesn't really have her titties out
[0:42:19] <Blank9> but then you self destruct and everyone jerks off
[0:42:19] <FirstFireKeeper> "pat the puritan"
[0:42:20] <rafaelba93> exept for her ass
[0:42:22] <bob900000> skirt is great
[0:42:23] <%Breaknoon> 9S
[0:42:23] <%CapnClassix> Absolutely
[0:42:23] <%coreyyotto> her outfit has a boob window
[0:42:24] <%coward_man> her dress 100% makes the look
[0:42:25] <%Aeogard> @PatStaresAt i made the poshi y meme on twitter btw
[0:42:26] <%AzureGale> Sure, but you can blow her up and her dress off lol
[0:42:26] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Bayo looks better with the outfit on
[0:42:27] <lets_be_friendos> there's a reason they added the option to blow up her clothes
[0:42:28] <+OmegaWeltall> yea when the skirt isnt blown off, she's actualy fairly covered up
[0:42:30] <ShichiNoBushi> More to the imagination.
[0:42:31] <%walternatorz> It sounds like Pat has done some research for his thesis.
[0:42:33] <%DianaTheAscian> 2B supports Pats argument
[0:42:34] <StarlitStunner> The blindfold makes it better stripYum
[0:42:35] <This_side_up_153> the mysseries. what is underneath makes it sexier.
[0:42:37] <+Gallhint> Self destruct
[0:42:37] <OldManDeckardCain> the only thing that should be covered up on 2b is her eyes
[0:42:37] <CozyRunner> enb2b
[0:42:40] <dumahiem> billy is the Grimace

[0:43:11] <+Gallhint> It's about as much effort as Blizzard would give!
[0:43:13] <%coward_man> It's PERFECT
[0:43:13] <ShichiNoBushi> The whole appeal of "zettai ryouiki" is the ratio of how much of the legs are covered with socks/stockings that they draw attention to the skirt or shorts.
[0:43:14] <%rawrmeowxd> This is how traps win
[0:43:15] <%deathscythe1287> @PatStaresAt I like 2B with the dress on

[1:27:14] <%walternatorz> Pat and Paige are in a healthy relationship.
[1:27:15] <%Ranryu692> distract Bowser with your yabbos
[1:27:17] <@SoFarFetched> pro tip is stop dropping the cat.
[1:27:23] <%Punchasaur> fury bowser waking up is what happens when paige finds pat with candy
[1:27:26] <morningmoondude> PRO TIP: be good at it
[1:27:27] <m1a_gunner> simple, don't let it die
[1:27:29] <LVL1_Scumbag> Don't throw the cat into the water
[1:27:31] <Orenjevel> pro tip: smack the shit out of bowsers cups
[1:27:32] <%Jaxnos> @PatStaresAt look closer at the island you grab the cat on, Pat.
[1:27:32] <LVL1_Scumbag> It dies
[1:27:34] <%JD_Lars> Don’t kill it
[1:27:37] <+Rekinsinn> there's not much more you can do than what you figured out
[1:27:39] <%mike2hands> don't drop de bussy
[1:27:40] <Profmcstevie> The pro tip is this is super easy after credits
[1:27:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> Literally little brother mode lol
[1:27:47] <%ssjklyco> Pro Tip: Keep your Paws on the cat
[1:27:48] <ExpressNode> Git guud
[1:27:49] <%JD_Lars> Wear cat suit he won’t run away
[1:27:51] <skyentombment> As opposed to the rest of the time when Paige does dick, ha gottem
[1:27:54] <%BoxNavy> :)
[1:28:08] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt unplug player 2 is some advice i could give
[1:28:31] <%BoxNavy> D:
[1:28:32] <%walternatorz> uhoh paige has to do things
[1:28:40] <%SomersaultJustice> paige can color that ? on the wall
[1:28:43] <%BoxNavy> i was cleaning my glasses i missed it sorry
[1:28:51] <tanarath> We saw you Helping, Paige.
[1:28:57] <%SomersaultJustice> it was on the tower
[1:28:57] <%walternatorz> Yes, there was a thing on the large column
[1:28:59] <%Movemeister> Bowser Jr’s shunpo is strong
[1:29:04] <+A_Fistful_of_Bees> I just got here and was wondering why Bowser Jr. was ambling around without purpose like he was drunk. It's because Paige is playing.
[1:29:07] <jmuster> was the protip just from a one guy?
[1:29:12] <%JD_Lars> No way around it. You have to walk the cat all the way back
[1:29:24] <ProjektRF> Chats drunk
[1:29:27] <BigNLazy> Could you use Jr as a platform?
[1:29:33] <LVL1_Scumbag> Do not murder cat
[1:29:35] <+Rekinsinn> i think the guy just wanted you to do shines in this level
[1:29:35] <%maskofmichael> psa1guy pro tips
[1:29:38] <@SoFarFetched> One Guy has left the chatroom,his job here was done.
[1:29:46] <LVL1_Scumbag> big tip
[1:29:46] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Protip: a cat is fine too
[1:29:51] <%Jaxnos> i did it, i sabotaged the pat
[1:29:57] <%BoxNavy> it wasnt a one guy. keep goin
[1:30:26] <%Ranryu692> Pat gets stuck on a lot of corners in this game
[1:30:27] <%kyh9> this music is GOAT tho
[1:30:40] <%Arancet> one day pat will wordlessly hand paige a list of names. she'll know what to do
[1:30:41] <%toastybites> I can't wait for the big reveal when One Guy was actually Two Guy
[1:30:44] <Profmcstevie> She cooks (kind of), she kills, she's the perfect woman
[1:30:49] <Orenjevel> is there co-op head-hopping tech here?

[1:32:23] <%SomersaultJustice> watch overwatch classic get announced
[1:32:23] <ThorW> Yes they are so terrible at their own games that they destory them and have to re-release version 1.0
[1:32:25] <%miguelrod777> legend of runterra is eating their lunch too much I guess LUL
[1:32:25] <enerkaizer> The last year screwed up hearthstone totally. The demon hunter class was a broken mess
[1:32:27] <%DianaTheAscian> No card game is as power creeped as yugioh
[1:32:29] <tubit> YEP
[1:32:29] <tanarath> Blizzard just just a skinsuit now.
[1:32:29] <+PenmanLupine> there've been some shit ass hearthstone seasons

[1:32:40] <%Jaxnos> i never said bring the cat up here, don't add to my one guy
[1:32:42] <%Ynkubus_> Blizzard stagnated super hard
[1:32:56] <rosencruez> blizzard is regressing
[1:33:02] <%PanicSwytch> What else was pat supposed to do
[1:33:05] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> So I have to ask: what recent products from Blizzard are actually decent?
[1:33:06] <%BoxNavy> dillweed alert
[1:33:07] <+Rekinsinn> yeah no for the record you were indeed doing the correct thing with the cat earlier
[1:33:07] <%linSP> if you never bought any expansions, don’t you already have hearthstone classic
[1:33:07] <rameiramaster> I was more interested in the Nintendo Direct and I don't even own a Switch
[1:33:13] <LVL1_Scumbag> Why Pat so salty today?
[1:33:17] <ProjektRF> Just carry the cat across the water
[1:33:22] <%JD_Lars> You just have to walk the cat all the way back. No shortcuts or pro tips other than wear the cat suit.
[1:33:24] <Blank9> because bank

[1:41:40] <@SoFarFetched> remaining 100
[1:41:40] <+Bonobonobone> of awakening?
[1:41:44] <morningmoondude> no, just 10
[1:41:45] <+skyheys> ...the giant ones, dude
[1:41:46] <@SoFarFetched> he has 41
[1:41:51] <@SoFarFetched> geefThink
[1:41:51] <aeonicvector> nah, theres just a point of perma-pissed bowser
[1:41:53] <LordOfThePoultry> no only 50
[1:41:53] <%JD_Lars> No
[1:41:54] <+FoolsArcade> I think they're just talkin' shit
[1:41:54] <+skyheys> no, oh my god pat
[1:42:02] <Profmcstevie> 50 to win
[1:42:14] <aeonicvector> yes
[1:42:15] <+skyheys> they said they did the whole thing without Goku pat
[1:42:18] <%asgard147> no, just 10
[1:42:22] <%MonsterEnvy> 50 to win just like in 64 you only needed 80 to win
[1:42:25] <%BoxNavy> yeah but 50 to win
[1:42:25] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> 41 to 50 is some huge anger point i guess?
[1:42:27] <%Dunmarkh> 69 for true ending
[1:42:28] <devanmuse> Postgame, Pat
[1:42:28] <Orenjevel> 50 are alllllll bonus cat shines
[1:42:29] <LVL1_Scumbag> We know
[1:42:29] <%SmoochSpider> 50 to win, 100 for completion
[1:42:30] <morningmoondude> 50 to kill bowser, 100 to 100% it for shits and giggles
[1:42:32] <sleepy_pixels> 50 for postgame
[1:42:32] <%Jaxnos> you should get all 100 anyway pat because otherwise it'll do psychic damage to you
[1:42:34] <%Kitafin> 100 for true end
[1:42:36] <SteelBeowulf> normal end at 50, true end at 100
[1:42:40] <@SoFarFetched> geefGasp HE DID IT
[1:42:44] <enerkaizer> 50 so you get the default end and make bowser not perma aggro, the rest for true end
[1:42:44] <ShichiNoBushi> 50% is actually a good ratio compared to other 3D collectathon platformers.
[1:42:46] <%Movemeister> You never need to collect all things to beat a Mario game dude
[1:42:50] <%psidefx> da babi

[1:43:12] <markdreizehn> lmao pat didn't even see the other baby right in front of him
[1:43:15] <Profmcstevie> I think 70% is the limit for "comfortable percent to beat game" so this being 50% is gucci
[1:43:16] <%valriot> YO IT LOOKS GOOD

[2:15:21] <%shurtal> little dude's gonna be able to run through a brick wall and not notice
[2:15:30] <%CalderGaming> not even that small, all breeds considered
[2:15:32] <heartlesshealer> you cannot use dog like medicine ball. Weight distributed unevenly
[2:15:41] <%walternatorz> Pat, you worked in produce right? You know what it's like to haul 60 lb sacks of potatoes.

[2:24:17] <%BoxNavy> only it doesnt have as much distance
[2:24:27] <+Ninjamaninjas> Does pat know how to long jump?
[2:24:29] <LorcaNomad> just use the tanuki
[2:24:30] <+Fooguwu> you can dive mid-air @PatStaresAt
[2:24:33] <+BlueEyesWhiteFatass> haha good bit pat, but lets get on with the game
[2:24:34] <%SomersaultJustice> nothing wastes time like trying to save time
[2:24:36] <@SoFarFetched> yeah you either have an item that lets you jump far,or you wait for the part with the long bridge.

[2:24:47] <tanarath> Pat probably doesn't
[2:24:47] <%BoxNavy> no
[2:24:48] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> maybe it's a bad take, but this game feels so much closer to sunshine than any of the others
[2:24:49] <Orenjevel> Yeah, i think taking lives out of mario games was the right call
[2:24:53] <jmuster> yeah long jump is in the game and i think they added the dive in odyssey
[2:24:55] <Profmcstevie> It's not THAT long of a long jump mind you
[2:24:57] <heartlesshealer> yay he remember now
[2:25:02] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> just in terms of mechanics
[2:25:09] <@commanderclaw> Still not as painful as watching Woolie play Odeyssy
[2:25:12] <heartlesshealer> yeah long jump into dive or tail float
[2:25:25] <%linSP> Somehow, bowser has returned
