[0:20:26] <%maskofmichael> Cheer500 Hey Pat, have you heard of the basic laws of human stupidity, written by Carlo M. Cipolla in 1976? Basically they're: 1-Everyone underestimates the number of stupid people, 2-Anyone can be stupid, regardless of their characteristics, 3-A stupid person is someone who causes losses to others without gains to themselves, 4-Non stupid people always underestimate the damage stupid people can do, and 5-A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person. Thoughts?
[0:20:26] <+T4silly> Remember to customize your John Halo for about 7 Achievements!

[0:28:47] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt if you wanna feel old, my first console was an xbox 360
[0:28:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> They'll never make another Unreal Tournament again. It's so sad
[0:28:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> ARENA SHOOTERS
[0:28:48] <UnderpaidBob> I was 6 when Halo 2 came out
[0:28:49] <@Ranryu692> @patstaresat do an Unreal Gold playthrough
[0:28:49] <hereiam407> Xbox had that sweet built in hard drive
[0:28:49] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt I was 3-4 ish then and didn't know what a video game was yet
[0:28:50] <redwidow1358> Halo was super dope when it came out because so many other shooters were just various shades of brown, while Halo had blues and greens and purples. It was infinitely better to just look at of all things.
[0:28:50] <GrokMonkey> Assault was in UT99 wasn't it?
[0:28:52] <%tanarath> THEY DID STUCK
[0:28:55] <hereiam407> 50000 blocks
[0:28:55] <%Tman451> UT99 had Assault even
[0:28:55] <Aydarkzero> like the Monkey mini game in Spyro 3
[0:28:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt I played Unreal Tournament on the fucking Dreamcast my dude
[0:29:01] <attackwarrior> Slayer!!!
[0:29:04] <DomunDomunDomun> Then I got scared when the first crewman died and went and played JSRF instead.

[0:29:07] <kikoeru_san> no one cares
[0:29:08] <+T4silly> You should!
[0:29:09] <VirtuaRailith> You can see a poster of Facing Worlds from UT in Fortnite and it makes me sad.
[0:29:13] <%hewlettfan96> Ahhh I remember unreal tournament and the German kid that got mad at it
[0:29:13] <%YakumoYomi> Too bad Epic is all about Fortnite these days
[0:29:13] <+T4silly> It's good!

[0:31:25] <marvel877> Its understandable.

[0:32:21] <slatersev> The best Pat Halo lore is the time "Snapshot King" was begging people to teach him how to not suck at Reach in 2011. Which isnt a joke at all, it actually happened
[0:32:22] <bob900000> that came out?
[0:32:22] <Aydarkzero> so nothing important
[0:32:23] <cartakus> ?
[0:32:23] <%dekkitout> The Ruined King?
[0:32:25] <shotguncrucifix> scalpers are selling halo edition consoles on kijiji for $1200 here
[0:32:27] <%hewlettfan96> @kikoeru_san like fr, it’s so convoluted and boring to pay
[0:32:28] <Halospaz117> Smaller than MCC
[0:32:28] <jumpyhugs> oh rad
[0:32:29] <VirtuaRailith> Battlechasers game was fun
[0:32:29] <@Ranryu692> the who what now?
[0:32:32] <kidb8> @tanarath I'm remind how I thought back as a young teen thinking Marathon took place after Halo 3.
[0:32:32] <LorcaNomad> It looks good
[0:32:32] <ergulor> yeah is pretty much the same game
[0:32:33] <DanThePumpkinman> WAIT ITS MADE BY THOSE GUYS
[0:32:33] <%YakumoYomi> I didn't like Battle Chasers
[0:32:35] <Saltmeisterr> its actually just a sequel
[0:32:38] <Saltmeisterr> its insane
[0:32:39] <DanThePumpkinman> FUCK
[0:32:40] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Isn't Riot Games a studio nearly as bad as Blizzard?
[0:32:41] <hereiam407> Yeh, but that's no Bro Fist down shit, hell nah brother
[0:32:42] <ergulor> battlechasers was great
[0:32:43] <attackwarrior> Halo
[0:32:44] <%hewlettfan96> Yeah it’s the same game
[0:33:06] <3viltiki> hi pat
[0:33:06] <DanThePumpkinman> NOW I HAVE TO BUY IT. DAMNIT. FUCK RIOT.
[0:33:10] <DomunDomunDomun> If Paige's download is taking too long, you can disable the HD textures in the DLC menu on steam to save about 7gb.
[0:33:12] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Oh, so not the Rising Thunder League game?
[0:33:16] <%dekkitout> A. Guy friend of the show
[0:33:17] <SubjectX07x> This game is like Reach mixed with Halo 3.
[0:33:18] <%RealThiele> @PocketBearIllustrator its got cosby room alumni in charge there so yeah
[0:33:20] <%NovaKnightmare> and turns out it is!
[0:33:20] <%Wallabri> and that guy... Was John Halo
[0:33:21] <ExpressNode> It looks alright for a 360 game
[0:33:23] <hereiam407> Probably just the campaign will be screwed
[0:33:25] <SubjectX07x> It's honestly pretty good.
[0:33:27] <+cmdrmobium> Boy I sure am glad to see John Halo
[0:33:30] <cybz99> This is the first time they made a good halo lol
[0:33:31] <%tanarath> @kidb8 I mean, it could fit in a lot of places. Before, after, etc.
[0:33:33] <kidb8> Halo 4 big issue was COD like MP and Halo 5 big issue was bad campagin.
[0:33:34] <DomunDomunDomun> They fucked it up with the predatory free to play bullshit.
[0:33:35] <rytisone> "When it's done" done right
[0:33:37] <Halospaz117> Honestly this feels like the best version of the 343 gameplay
[0:33:39] <zero2700> game is fun BP is a fuck
[0:33:39] <%SharkMissile> I mean, halo 3 was the best original, maybe halo 6 will be the best sequel
[0:33:39] <+Droozy01> I cant wait for you join faze clan to win champsionships and earn tons of money to raise his place in rich people of canada
[0:33:41] <%SveriSageAdvice> making custom game types crashes your game constantly, i tried to remake SWAT
[0:33:41] <JayPastaForce> WHAT A NIGHT
[0:33:42] <%twistedj3ster> You should invite Lyle Rath for a few games
[0:33:43] <kikoeru_san> oh sheeeeeeeet boy
[0:33:43] <%DianaTheAscian> This one I've only heard good things about even the crazy fans I know seem to like it
[0:33:44] <%KetsuoTaberu> oh no
[0:33:44] <DomunDomunDomun> Which means at least the core game is good.
[0:33:47] <waltzqueen> OH BOY
[0:33:48] <Profmcstevie> is it pretty good or is it just good enough in a starved environment
[0:33:48] <+Avossk_> Turns out third time's the charm for 343

[0:34:25] <ExpressNode> The only things I watched on G4 were Attack of the Show, Xplay, and Ninja Warrior
[0:34:25] <Dunmarkh> That was like half your old group
[0:34:27] <kikoeru_san> Adam did cocaine? like in a problematic way?
[0:34:31] <huskarl_zap> yep

[0:35:21] <mid_sneak> funny with the shoot
[0:35:26] <%hewlettfan96> Words are bad
[0:35:30] <kidb8> Halo 5 MP from what I heard is pretty good.
[0:35:31] <%psidefx> PREACH JAM
[0:35:32] <hereiam407> No, Halo MP gets the right amount of respect
[0:35:39] <@Ranryu692> Gears of War 3 had co-op?
[0:35:42] <%dekkitout> Multiplayer is justifiably good
[0:35:44] <%tanarath> God, 5 was such trash. The coop's ok & the MP is solid.
[0:35:45] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat is an expert on play Halo campaigns muted in a game store
[0:35:46] <huskarl_zap> adam quit games slammed the door several times did meth on set and ran some kind of consulting firm that had no employees and was in a empty lot that didnt exist
[0:35:46] <Treasure_Vault> Co Op campaigns are rare, so we take what we can get
[0:35:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> We need to get Woolei to play Gears of War, it'll be a ride LUL
[0:35:50] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the download should only be like 30 minutes
[0:35:50] <%NovaKnightmare> his suit does NOT jerk him off!!
[0:35:51] <%RealThiele> Halo 1 MP kept a business in my town afloat for like 8 years
[0:35:51] <thesoldierofjoy> None of the games are bad, but the story got kinda dumb.
[0:35:52] <rytisone> Halo Legendary coop campaign with Paige when?
[0:35:52] <Aydarkzero> yeah Gears 3 had co-op
[0:35:53] <JetpackMcQuack> it's a for real video game
[0:35:53] <+cmdrmobium> choese
[0:35:55] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Halo got overshadowed by COD 4 tbh
[0:35:55] <%SharkMissile> I'm getting overwhelmed with like, 20 weapons that sort of do the same thing
[0:35:57] <Voidvas> Infection is GOAT
[0:35:58] <Lodestarrobot> choese
[0:35:59] <slix3431> Peach talks to Pat like he's a dog that can reply
[0:35:59] <cartakus> You ever gonna do dead space again?
[0:36:00] <LorcaNomad> LUL
[0:36:02] <+meteor530> Halo died when Reach came out with it's MP for a lot of people. The campaign wasd awesome.
[0:36:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Another chez plate?
[0:36:04] <%Broand> The game doesn't like me having only 2gb of VRAM and runs in 10fps for me sadge
[0:36:12] <dailylifewithry> Overrated is an overrated term
[0:36:13] <kidb8> Pat streams Halo novels is something I want to hear.
[0:36:13] <marvel877> MP is great, although some of the additions in 5 were kinda...meh.
[0:36:14] <+pupil31> LUL
[0:36:14] <+foomaster22> MP has been at least solid for every game
[0:36:17] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[0:36:19] <Treasure_Vault> That's pretty good.
[0:36:22] <+alphonseisbest> IT NOT
[0:36:22] <Cyropike> Halo 5's campaign sucked but the multiplayer was really good
[0:36:25] <hereiam407> @Broand Hmm, can't figure out the issue there
[0:36:25] <%Agami23> but the music is amazing in halo
[0:36:25] <%optimasmaximas> LUL

[0:36:28] <%KineticZen> KineticZen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! I remember Halo being derided as "casual" by FPS players when it came out, due to the regenerating health mechanic & console exclusivity.  Years later, here we are.

[0:39:42] <Halospaz117> Dammit now I want some Doritos
[0:39:43] <JetpackMcQuack> 2008-20013
[0:39:43] <ZephynM> I remember when Halo 4 came out, he was on Dorito and I think Mountain Dew?
[0:39:43] <%SharkMissile> Mountain Dewrito Man
[0:39:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> Could be worse, he could've been on Lay's
[0:39:44] <JayPastaForce> I LEGIT saw an ad for PRINGLES selling 2x XP

[0:39:59] <Ravioli_Ronin> Yeah, when infinite was supposed to come out, but didn’t?
[0:40:00] <ZephynM> I remember buying a lot of doritos and mountain dew because I played a lot of Halo 4.
[0:40:00] <%IamGrapes> and Mountain Dew
[0:40:00] <RickyRelucent> JUST CHEESE
[0:40:01] <+reaver93> Pringles leaked the early launch of the MP
[0:40:02] <cartakus> I though he was astolfo man
[0:40:04] <ThePimpGuin> He was also on slurpies
[0:40:04] <+pmtriox> You're talking in a past tense as if that isn't right now
[0:40:06] <hereiam407> They had cans of Pringles with John Halo's image for the past eight months
[0:40:07] <kidb8> Now he's on Monster Energy and Rockstar drinks.

[0:40:47] <Voidvas> The Keighley Awards?
[0:40:47] <TIME_PUNCHER> Mario Party is the Monopoly of Overcooked
[0:40:53] <RickyRelucent> Pat, you said the croissant was useless without ham and jsut cheese. But here you are gladly eating the cheese by itself
[0:40:55] <waltzqueen> @huskarl_zap cursed
[0:40:58] <bigshedman> Paige would play the tugofwar-minigame and her hand would just explode when she spins the stick.
[0:40:59] <redwidow1358> Hey guys, remember that time Microsoft and Pringles had a Game Pass promotion with codes on cans, but all the cans in Europe had the bottoms flipped the other way, so all the codes were freely visible without buying and eating the fucking chips? So everyone could just get infinite Game Pass codes to sell online?
[0:41:05] <hereiam407> The Prole Cotocol
[0:41:07] <%SaiyanShoto> The new one has online
[0:41:13] <+reaver93> Two things I hope you never stream: Mario Party and Kingdom Hearts They kill things
[0:41:16] <NitronStreams> DA COLPRODACOL
[0:41:16] <+polothegreatest> best promo ever
[0:41:19] <hereiam407> Everyone was wrog=ng
[0:41:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> BUT THE COLE PROTOCOL
[0:41:20] <Halospaz117> Pretty much
[0:41:21] <%hewlettfan96> @metaphase72 Didn’t call of duty have a monster flavour? To promote black is 2
[0:41:22] <hereiam407> wrong*
[0:41:23] <%IMDRanged> @ZephynM Yeah. Jeez, time flies almost until the game studio messes up
[0:41:24] <%InternetShis> We were

[0:41:27] <%Ynkubus_> To quote V Mills "SHUT THE FUCK UP"

[0:41:31] <%ArthurDayne88> Yep

[0:41:38] <cartakus> Me

[0:41:42] <hereiam407> Da COLE PROTOCOL
[0:41:44] <GodKingReiss> Late to the topic but the Attack on Titan armband march is WORSE with context. The armbands were specifically attributed to Titan Warriors, Warrior cadets (child soldiers), and concentration camp civilians.
[0:41:44] <%hewlettfan96> Yeah they went cray
[0:41:47] <+Posh_Cat> Reading that much lore dies that to you... bugifSuffer
[0:41:50] <KaitlynnHere> Wasn’t that the point though?

[0:41:56] <Voidvas> Books Stinky
[0:41:57] <dabuurd> would you rather read RE book or Halo book
[0:41:57] <hereiam407> The Halo Novels were ok
[0:41:58] <supergoblinpunch> The Loremasters need you to know.
[0:41:58] <thesoldierofjoy> If im totally honest i thought that book wasnt even that interesting
[0:42:00] <mikeriffic> THe books arent bad, cole protocol isnt great tho
[0:42:00] <cartakus> Who's cole?
[0:42:00] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt i read all of them and became the master chief of sadness
[0:42:01] <+Dumple_Roe> reading halo book is also stupid
[0:42:02] <tigerfang86> YOU'RE HUGE
[0:42:02] <TIME_PUNCHER> Caliban Cove
[0:42:02] <Sprawler14> John Halo doesn't like being away from his armor tho
[0:42:03] <ZephynM> Is anyone else getting static from the audio or is this just me?
[0:42:05] <KaitlynnHere> Oh here we go
[0:42:05] <%Tyrimat> The What

[0:42:06] <%hewlettfan96> Ahhh
[0:42:06] <subjectg> And those RE books
[0:42:06] <mikeriffic> but of course they started with a bad one
[0:42:07] <%NovaKnightmare> Its hit or miss
[0:42:07] <zeff360> reach is solid, the rest of the novels are pretty bad tho
[0:42:10] <%AnthroMetal> pat I own the Warframe comic
[0:42:11] <$FusRoDom> Pat confirmed can't read
[0:42:11] <hereiam407> How about them Mass Effect novels?
[0:42:13] <attackwarrior> BDG
[0:42:13] <%hewlettfan96> Dune novels
[0:42:14] <%optimasmaximas> Shadows of reach was good i heard
[0:42:14] <+meteor530> Or the Mass effect novels...when Kei Lang is there...
[0:42:15] <Ravioli_Ronin> Remember when they made Halo 4 & 5 heavily rely on players having read the books?
[0:42:15] <+pmtriox> are they as awful as the Resident Evil novles?
[0:42:15] <marvel877> I blame V telling Woolie its a spoiler when the Cole Protocol is a thing in the fucking manual of the first game.
[0:42:17] <%captain_thickthighs> The only good video game literature is doujins
[0:42:18] <subjectg> RA Salvatore was his name?

[0:46:29] <%AncelDeLambert> what about soaking them in water?
[0:46:31] <%Monkeyweed21> It takes like 1-3 months after launch to figure out if a new Battlefield is good and so far 2042 isnt looking great
[0:46:34] <$Order_of_Mystery> poor Paige
[0:46:34] <%studleydoorite> maybe the sight of onions does it, try chopping them blindfolded
[0:46:34] <%MidnightBurst12> laboratory goggles?

[0:46:35] <Kalarchis> Keep them in the fridge and you won't have this problem

[0:53:14] <%barkon345> fuck you Gridania is the best city
[0:53:17] <%KineticZen> Better than loser ex-pirates and oligarchs
[0:53:18] <%hewlettfan96> Hehhehe
[0:53:18] <bigshedman> @Monkeyweed21 Wait then what is even the benefit of making them characters rather than customizable classes?!
[0:53:19] <+qasilq> I always have trust issues with horn headed beings
[0:53:21] <%blastyoboots> (just kidding talk down about Homestuck all you want)
[0:53:22] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Wait she does tho
[0:53:22] <G_Ship1> I’m so confused
[0:53:23] <stealthfart> That’s her hair
[0:53:24] <%SuckerPunchSyd> You can see them
[0:53:26] <+MGSKomodoDragon> I'm a Limsa degenerate. Fight me
[0:53:27] <%espanishcanamurciana> psaWink psaWink psaWink
[0:53:29] <Sprawler14> Because moon cats are a tribal society that are forced into banditry in order to survive due to gridania and ixals encroaching on their hunting grounds
[0:53:31] <%hewlettfan96> Hehhe
[0:53:33] <%superc37> hey so anyone here know how to actually play infinite cuz i keep getting this popup that comes up telling me that i need dx12 or whatever even tho i have dx12
[0:53:33] <%BinaryFireball> it IS casual
[0:53:34] <+NickHatesSnow> Gridania sucks who likes it?
[0:53:34] <%espanishcanamurciana> hey elmo <3
[0:53:36] <%BinaryFireball> regen hp is bs
[0:53:37] <Sharizord> is that what the racist guy in the archer main quest was about?
[0:53:37] <+Count_Graagh> bork
[0:53:38] <%xerioes> dont forget ishgard and and its aura raceism
[0:53:38] <%hereiam407> The Flood make you clench your booty hole
[0:53:39] <Daxalog> Any fps thats not Quake caused people to get upset. Now no one cares
[0:53:42] <%hewlettfan96> Elmooo
[0:53:53] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt both the arc and lnc questlines show the gridanians being racist as shit
[0:53:57] <%tusk102> i didnt mean to
[0:53:59] <+NickHatesSnow> it is
[0:54:00] <%tusk102> @ pat oops
[0:54:00] <%KineticZen> Bungie knew what they were doing back then
[0:54:05] <+VestigeOuroboros> This is correct
[0:54:07] <kidb8> Controller is better than M&KB for Halo Infinite.
[0:54:08] <%KineticZen> I really regret not playing Marathon since it was Mac-exclusive
[0:54:12] <marvel877> I cared about Halo because of how the Warthog handled.
[0:54:13] <huskarl_zap> auto aim assist
[0:54:14] <%athuramn> the auto aim for controller in infinite is really strong
[0:54:15] <kidb8> Granted I turn my deadzones to 0.
[0:54:16] <%hereiam407> Big spread and reticles too
[0:54:17] <%RealThiele> aim assist yeyeyeye
[0:54:19] <%captain_thickthighs> what does casual even mean in 2021 unless your making money playing i dont get it.
[0:54:22] <%slimmixrp> Yur
[0:54:26] <%dekkitout> Very beeg ttk (times to kill)
[0:54:26] <%Agami23> halo one is hilarious with a controller. hunters cant handle you
[0:54:28] <+nial_evol> tracking with a mouse is still way better
[0:54:40] <Xiangchang> Pat's finally playing a Halo! Hazah!
[0:54:44] <kidb8> Halo MCC on the other hand is nice to both Pad and M&KB.
[0:54:46] <%KineticZen> We've seen a big resurgence in old-school FPS games lately, but it was dire for a while
[0:54:48] <%Monkeyweed21> @bigshedman oh you still have all the loadout stuff, the only thing the specialist decides is one ability like a grappling hook or recon drone and 1 trait, they just decided to force you to use a specific "skin" if you want to use a specific ability
[0:54:54] <%dekkitout> It's reductionist
[0:54:56] <%tusk102> @Agami23 jump jump jump spin around them jump
[0:55:00] <BoneofMalkav> I cared about Halo because it was the perfect evolution of Marathon 2
[0:55:04] <%Wallabri> YES
[0:55:04] <%KineticZen> Now you have games for each side of the spectrum
[0:55:07] <@SoFarFetched> @BogBodyPositive please stop spamming the same question
[0:55:08] <+Catpurnicus> well money = dev time
[0:55:08] <%hereiam407> GTA Definitive edition, about three weeks
[0:55:09] <marvel877> We talking about GTA again?
[0:55:10] <%valriot> Low sensitivty MK is good tho
[0:55:11] <+NickHatesSnow> I'm so happy classis fps style is big again
[0:55:13] <JetpackMcQuack> take the message not the words
[0:55:16] <slatersev> Pat actually right for once
[0:55:21] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt also generally speaking a bad director can make or break a game (see CP2077 being remade 7 times or something)
[0:55:34] <%hereiam407> Most licensed movie games
[0:55:37] <ZaCrimsonDragon> Fucking Spider-Man 2 BB
[0:55:37] <EynoStiles> Hey Chat, does Pat know about the League of Legends Ruined King is out?
[0:55:39] <+balouie> ET
[0:55:39] <%maskofmichael> Time is the enemy of Quality
[0:55:41] <alexandrecau> will you applaud mediocrity
[0:55:44] <Profmcstevie> EVERYTHING FromSoft when you find out they pull shit out of their ass at the finish line
[0:55:48] <skullneedles> if only there was a solution to games being rushed........
[0:55:53] <%blastyoboots> DIRECTOR/PRODUCER/WRITER
[0:55:54] <Baljhet> rooD

[0:55:58] <%GabeSweetMan> HEY
[0:55:58] <Lodestarrobot> the Activision thing reminds me how vampire the masquerade bloodlines 2 got scrapped to start over
[0:55:58] <Gray_LoFi> Am writer, can confirm
[0:55:58] <%studleydoorite> it's true, we are
[0:55:59] <theanora1> how dare you
[0:55:59] <+kortin> :(
[0:56:00] <%hereiam407> Looking at you David Cage
[0:56:00] <%hewlettfan96> Yeah if they take a long ass time and are shit they have no excuse *cough cough* TLOU2
[0:56:01] <%blastyoboots> well not director
[0:56:01] <%optimasmaximas> then how do you justify cyberpunk other than saying fuck management
[0:56:03] <+extradopeness> im a writer you jerk
[0:56:04] <%barrakuta371> Didn't that one Star Trek shooter have like 3 years of dev time and still came out bad?
[0:56:05] <%Wallabri> ALWAYS err on the side of the teams not having enough time and/or money
[0:56:06] <ssks123> thats getting quoted and posted on twitter
[0:56:06] <+qasilq> dam my bet was on marketing
[0:56:12] <Baljhet> somebody clip this and send it to Docsquiddy
[0:56:12] <bob900000> David Cage
[0:56:14] <%hereiam407> David Cage again
[0:56:16] <%blastyoboots> okay maybe director in the case of George Lucas XD
[0:56:16] <incredibleCrayon> Stuff gets cut during dev
[0:56:23] <%dekkitout> Halo 1-3 were miracles
[0:56:35] <Xiangchang> Yeah, a large portion of Halo 3 was supposed to be in Halo 2.
[0:56:36] <%tusk102> AND THEY DID
[0:56:36] <LorcaNomad> wh- what
[0:56:39] <LorcaNomad> what
[0:56:40] <Profmcstevie> Because we cannot fix it
[0:56:41] <%hereiam407> So, we blew the ship up
[0:56:41] <bigshedman> We'll fix it in post LUL
[0:56:44] <SubjectX07x> And in all honesty... THEY DO.
[0:56:45] <+Catpurnicus> yeah the library in Halo is basically Lost Izalith from dark souls
[0:56:49] <Tracazoid> It's because they spent a bunch of time making a demo for E3 I think and realized they didn't have shit for a real game
[0:56:50] <subjectg> teleportation grids!
[0:56:52] <%homelesstwinky> Replace it with a cutscene
[0:56:53] <%MisterTylerrr> If I were the writer in there I'd be like "THE WRITER GONNA FIX WHAT???"
[0:56:54] <+VestigeOuroboros> Halo CE: "shoot stuff" Halo 2: Space political opera Halo 3: "Just shoot stuff, also arby is there."
[0:56:54] <+Catpurnicus> last minute copy paste
[0:56:57] <MidnightPacif1c> jump through a portal
[0:57:00] <resinite709> SEWER LEVEL
[0:57:00] <marvel877> Halo 3 was really just the second half of Halo 2 and even then they scrapped/changed stuff because the OG writer left
[0:57:11] <+MackFighters> like lava flow?
[0:57:14] <%cvp5127> tighten the graphics on level 3
[0:57:21] <thesoldierofjoy> Well yeah, lava flows better than wind
[0:57:22] <%hereiam407> Luckily most games are about getting random Mguffins
[0:57:23] <@SoFarFetched> @BogBodyPositive Seriously stop
[0:57:24] <+D00msDayDan> “What do you do when you cant think of a way to get from a to b? Teleport” -halo devs in the CE commentary
[0:57:26] <%dekkitout> I got your ludonarrative right here tajC
[0:57:29] <+Deekman> That’s how you make a dark souls 2

[1:01:02] <%GabeSweetMan> The best Anti-Joke I was ever told was "What do you call a dresser with a cape? .....a super dresser." It's so bad. I don't know why I burst into a fit of giggles every time I hear it.
[1:01:05] <McBubbles07> wtf LUL
[1:01:05] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt Halo Infinite has literal ULTRAKILL tech with the Repulser where you can use it to make your grenades and rockets move faster if you hit it right after shooting/throwing it.
[1:01:05] <%optimasmaximas> nice, thank you for your service

[1:01:06] <%Evil_Emu147> Evil_Emu147 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! I love playing WHM in FF14 and healing in general.  I struggle to feel the appeal of tanking or DPS but I have dabbled in GNB and RDM.  Any tips for getting into other roles or should I just shut up and enjoy the Sage hype?
[1:01:07] <%hereiam407> Invest as little energy as possible
[1:01:09] <%Saadi90> Yup
[1:01:10] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> honestly that's the best advice
[1:01:12] <%twistedj3ster> It CAN break you
[1:01:14] <+Deekman> Leave that shit at work
[1:01:14] <%za7az> What about the patients?
[1:01:16] <Profmcstevie> if you care you will break
[1:01:18] <%Treuan> It is not work you can take home with you
[1:01:18] <%cvp5127> kill your soul
[1:01:20] <gslayer14> underpaid, overworked
[1:01:21] <%MisterTylerrr> If you give a fuck, you will become someone elses patient
[1:01:23] <GarbageNirvana> yup
[1:01:23] <%codedoomboy> LUL
[1:01:24] <s1rcuit> there is only pain
[1:01:25] <+MackFighters> thick skin required
[1:01:25] <LorcaNomad> yup that's true
[1:01:26] <%hereiam407> The world has a lot of problems
[1:01:26] <%afronooch> a level of disassociation is mandatory
[1:01:27] <%dekkitout> Oh you mean like that. In that case, 100%
[1:01:28] <%ChrisPlaysThing> You will grind yourself into shit and need the same help you provide
[1:01:31] <akitanito> same deal with nurses and doctors
[1:01:32] <@SoFarFetched> Also dont do what that one therapist did and complain online.
[1:01:33] <+possumwalsh1221> This is fact
[1:01:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Good ol Social Workers Dilemma
[1:01:34] <Lodestarrobot> how much am i missing out on not being in a free company, I'm almost done with shadowbringers

[1:01:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> Care but seperate
[1:01:37] <brachydios777> Yeah, that’s true
[1:01:37] <MusouMiko> Hi Social worker here, pat is 1000% correct
[1:01:45] <tigerfang86> yeah that's some rough shit
[1:01:46] <%reaver93> Hey Pat, what's your game of the year so far?
[1:01:46] <bigshedman> As a social worker who worked in a refugee center for 3 years, I can confirm, shit's rough.
[1:01:46] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:01:47] <+MoonObscure> lol
[1:01:48] <Profmcstevie> Doctors can't go home when someone dies, they have to go back to work to save others
[1:01:49] <%hewlettfan96> Jesus wow that’s so saaaad
[1:01:49] <%asgard147> don't they kinda HAVE to give a bit of a fuck tho?
[1:01:49] <%hereiam407> Shooting grunts won't feel the same
[1:01:50] <ScreamLord> That series is gonna blow chunks
[1:01:50] <%transporterthesequel> Gotta have that on/off switch
[1:01:51] <%SinnerEbru> it IS kinda the thing of boundary walls made of lead
[1:01:52] <BarnYardFiddler> That’s when vicodin and perkies come in
[1:01:54] <cartakus> Yup, you have to react to the most horrible shit with nothing
[1:01:56] <%captain_thickthighs> I work at a checkin counter I can not care like a pro now.
[1:01:57] <+Dumple_Roe> paramount+ but yeah

[1:01:59] <scrumbotime> Step one, don't care, Step two, don't post tiktoks mocking patients
[1:02:01] <MusouMiko> You *have* to be able to emotionally distance yourself from your job
[1:02:02] <%TheAntiNihilist> @PatStaresAt   did you ever say when you would play No More Heroes 3?
[1:02:03] <G_Ship1> You member your therapist has a therapist
[1:02:05] <%barrakuta371> Not even Netflix, Paramount+ LUL
[1:02:05] <%hereiam407> @asgard147 As little as possible
[1:02:06] <theanora1> So are you going to be there for "The New War" Pat?
[1:02:10] <brachydios777> Why paramount?

[1:02:55] <%hereiam407> She's secretly sneaking away to kick your butt in Halo
[1:02:56] <tjkillemup2> Is there any chance the Halo series will be good or at least laughably bad instead of just  boring
[1:02:56] <ScreamLord> The delighted giggling of children from Grunt B-Day will give you anxiety if you give a fuck about dem kids
[1:02:57] <%SinnerEbru> every therapist has a therapist, but some also work on pat's rule: you freak out and command my time too much, you go in the timeout box

[1:03:40] <%reaver93> @KineticZen It's not made by Paramount themselves, it's made by Showtime
[1:03:40] <akitanito> You mean those time out closets?
[1:03:44] <%ShogunNoonto> You are talking about no more heroes
[1:03:46] <brachydios777> The Sopranos even shows why being too invested is a bad idea
[1:03:46] <+tinytinykittycat> Its therapists all the way down

[1:04:35] <akitanito> bobby knew
[1:04:36] <Azaziz> @patstaresat do you think too many devs are using FOMO to keep players interested? And is there a better solution
[1:04:36] <brachydios777> Halo has a bunch
[1:04:37] <Saltmeisterr> fuck em
[1:04:39] <%captain_thickthighs> My favorite part of Halo is Woolie reading the Bible passage wrong

[1:04:57] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It's a "Magical" mystery Kappa
[1:04:57] <%hereiam407> Bobby Kodick is changing his name to Robby Bodick
[1:04:58] <theanora1> He used his fucking WORK E-MAIL!
[1:04:59] <+possumwalsh1221> Oh ain’t that something hmmm
[1:04:59] <%InternetShis> HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
[1:05:01] <littlest_light> hOW COULD THIS BE
[1:05:04] <Roninx136> Fall of Reach is ag ood book imo
[1:05:04] <$Order_of_Mystery> context: Kotick knew the sexual harassment was going on and did nothing.
[1:05:05] <neroforte177> this is my shocked face
[1:05:07] <+VestigeOuroboros> correct
[1:05:09] <%MelBrooksKA> Early Halo books are pretty good, I liked Fall of Reach and Harvest
[1:05:10] <%SharkMissile> Yeah 4 and 5 aren't....good
[1:05:10] <%hereiam407> 343 hasn't done itself any favors
[1:05:10] <%MechArch> i love halo
[1:05:11] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt did you see Bobby Kotick taking a huge pay cut so they dont throw him under the bus
[1:05:11] <supergoblinpunch> Oh noooo, I'm shocked
[1:05:13] <Dunmarkh> Bobby Kotick was that desperate for a date that didn't care about the devil horns
[1:05:13] <%MajorCrasher> is this the beginning or end of the stream?
[1:05:16] <SubjectX07x> 343 did bad, now they do a good. We will praise them when they do a good.
[1:05:17] <cartakus> Who could have guessed
[1:05:18] <JetpackMcQuack> but the decade before that
[1:05:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> halo is cool
[1:05:20] <@Ranryu692> it's almost like splitting Bungie in half was a bad idea
[1:05:22] <marvel877> Next seasons Always Sunny's gonna have an Epstein related epsiode.
[1:05:23] <Buttku> does 40k count as good videogame literature?
[1:05:26] <+VestigeOuroboros> 343 has actively undermined themselves repeatedly.
[1:05:26] <commanderapathy> why is everyone in hollywood fucked in the head
[1:05:28] <%hereiam407> @MajorCrasher Still the beggining
[1:05:28] <%reaver93> 343 finally realised that giving Halo fans actual Halo gameplay is what we want
[1:05:29] <+Catpurnicus> kotick took part in the harassment apparently
[1:05:32] <G_Ship1> @majorcrasher start
[1:05:34] <%hewlettfan96> HMMMMMM
[1:05:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> What you doin
[1:05:38] <Shwepie> @Azaziz They absolutely are. Is there a better way to retain players? No. Is there a less abusive way? Yes.
[1:05:38] <redwidow1358> I wonder why that would be there. It must be a Photoshop to keep Bobby from getting dates.
[1:05:43] <Sprawler14> warfrime
[1:05:44] <brachydios777> @buttku 40k didn’t start as video games
[1:05:46] <attackwarrior> Miss you bungie
[1:05:48] <Mudstone12> i hate how every piece of armor is locked behind premium battle pass

[1:05:58] <gslayer14> @ReallyBigRocks right, i was thinking of heptameter, not pentameter
[1:05:58] <%Treuan> Cheer500 Am I crazy, or does Dragonball by Daylight actually look really cool?
[1:05:59] <+Midashu> FOMO Warframe
[1:05:59] <@SoFarFetched> @Ranryu692 spltting bungie in half is definitely bad when you need them to not fall to your death Kappa
[1:06:00] <Sunstalker> They made prime farming easierr plus a paid way to farm them easier too
[1:06:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Buttku No 40k went around the long way to the point their video games came AFTER their books
[1:06:01] <%SinnerEbru> nice
[1:06:01] <%dekkitout> Prime resurgence: Do not buy it, farm Deimos t5 bounty
[1:06:03] <%hereiam407> 343 should make Halo: Federation Force for the Switch
[1:06:08] <stealthfart> @buttku Tabletop first so no
[1:06:11] <MidnightPacif1c> theu made new premium currency people kinda mad
[1:06:19] <Sunstalker> No more VAULT, Pat
[1:06:20] <Buttku> @brachydios777  fair
[1:06:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> YEAH
[1:06:21] <@Ranryu692> @SoFarFetched meowriiiFacepalm
[1:06:24] <huskarl_zap> oh yeah infinite writer is Dan Abnett
[1:06:35] <%dekkitout> Dunno about that
[1:06:35] <akitanito> why?
[1:06:35] <%hewlettfan96> Jesus Christ why was that burp
[1:06:35] <%captain_thickthighs> @patstaresat They re-released all the old primes. Might be to pad out that last quarter.
[1:06:36] <+Midashu> Vaulting still a thing
[1:06:37] <MidnightPacif1c> Limited time
[1:06:38] <Sunstalker> Some vaulting, ok.
[1:06:39] <%psydaku> psydaku subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Random music recommendation: The Trooper by Iron Maiden
[1:06:40] <@Ranryu692> @SoFarFetched that was excellent
[1:06:41] <%DianaTheAscian> cool
[1:06:43] <Baljhet> "no more vaulting" seems like an easy dunk on Destiny
[1:06:44] <%blastyoboots> at least for this event?
[1:06:45] <%tanarath> huh
[1:06:46] <+Midashu> Resurgence goes away in January
[1:06:46] <%Ynkubus_> Yep, they needed to do that
[1:06:50] <@QueequegTheater> Are we gonna do a big Halo
[1:06:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt NO this is for the New war
[1:06:50] <Treasure_Vault> Are rivens still fucked to upgrade?
[1:06:51] <brachydios777> Finally Twitch is unstuck for me
[1:06:52] <@SoFarFetched> @Ranryu692 I had to seize the opportunity LUL
[1:06:53] <Shwepie> Vault got too full.
[1:06:54] <%OutofPots> Hey pat.. I start my new job on Monday. I told my closest friends the good news, and got called a bitchy try hard. Turns out, they've been talking crap behind my back for months. So yeah....Halo
[1:06:57] <anAngryHamster> God I wish I could still enjoy Warframe
[1:07:00] <%MelBrooksKA> @hereiam407 Isn't that just Grif Ball?
[1:07:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> game's real fun tho

[1:07:05] <%optimasmaximas> @huskarl_zap does that mean he’s a good writer then?
[1:07:06] <SubjectX07x> Progression problems are being worked on though so that's nice.
[1:07:09] <%captain_thickthighs> So wait are we getting Halo tonight?
[1:07:12] <Sprawler14> apparently 343 said they're looking at fixing that too
[1:07:15] <%dekkitout> @Treasure_Vault If you're broke/lazy yeah
[1:07:16] <%tusk102> glad the battle pass is reach shit first
[1:07:16] <%hereiam407> @MelBrooksKA Now that you mention it
[1:07:19] <brachydios777> Wait what? You mean Deatiny vaulting?
[1:07:22] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> It's just fun
[1:07:24] <%hewlettfan96> Halo isn’t free tho

[1:07:32] <%Logoth_> Im happy its not another fucking BR
[1:07:32] <dapperskeleton69> its just good game
[1:07:34] <DomunDomunDomun> All the problems are due to it being free, and nothing good about it from it being free.
[1:07:35] <%hereiam407> Whats the DLC pay for content situation?
[1:07:36] <%MechArch> i love halo
[1:07:36] <SubjectX07x> @PatStaresAt They're apparently working on improving the progression to be less slow.
[1:07:37] <brachydios777> F R E S
[1:07:37] <%SaiyanShoto> They’re already starting to rework the battle pass too
[1:07:37] <rytisone> so many children to shoot
[1:07:38] <ExpressNode> Habro

[1:07:40] <JetpackMcQuack> go git some gud
[1:07:40] <%Agami23> i cant believe bobby kotick was the one who wrote that fran townsend email a while back
[1:07:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> Free Halo for every man, woman, and child
[1:07:43] <Sprawler14> kissing your coworker
[1:07:43] <+humdrumgum> from what i saw theres no in game currency rewards from the battlepass so you can only get it by buying it directly
[1:07:43] <$Order_of_Mystery> and it's not Destiny's crucible! win win for all!
[1:07:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> a beautiful thing
[1:07:44] <BarnYardFiddler> Is there split screen?
[1:07:44] <brachydios777> *F R E E
[1:07:45] <@Ranryu692> I miss pre-Reach Halo mp
[1:07:45] <Krash_Override> I went 28 an 6 on a Big Team Battle and it was like the most fun I've had in a LONG time with a PVP FPS
[1:07:45] <Fenlig> 100% my friends are poor and lazy, halo is great
[1:07:49] <Lodestarrobot> @outofpots what the fuck that sounds like an awful time
[1:07:51] <%barrakuta371> Fuh-ree
[1:07:51] <+demon1103> i dont know how i feel about it being free....i kinda wish it wasnt and you could just EARN the customizations instead
[1:07:51] <%tanarath> m you have Halo. Everyone has Halo.
[1:07:55] <Halospaz117> @Logoth_ Only BR around these parts is the Battle Rifle
[1:08:00] <+alabastah> is it free forever or just for now?
[1:08:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> You can have a little halo...as a treat
[1:08:07] <%hereiam407> Is Halo right for me?
[1:08:08] <TheBigPutty> i can't consider buying it if 343 can't even make a fullscreen option
[1:08:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> @alabastah forever
[1:08:11] <%dekkitout> Job security!
[1:08:11] <%tusk102> people ALWAYS need healers
[1:08:12] <%IamGrapes> I played the Halo Infinite muliplayer yesterday and it felt like i was back in high school playing Halo 2 with my buds

[1:08:23] <+alabastah> sick
[1:08:23] <theanora1> Hey Pat did you see Outriders Updated?
[1:08:27] <+VestigeOuroboros> Considering CoD just released Vanguard for full retail price and it's more unpolished than any shooter I've played in a decade, infinite is too good to be free to play but it is anyway.
[1:08:31] <cartakus> Hey pat you already have a build idea for Elden Ring?
[1:08:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> Green DPS
[1:08:41] <+acridpaladin> My favorite part of halo is how it killed steam so hard it made everyone on my friendlist also crash their steam
[1:08:46] <+DeRedBaron> yeah atm tanks are like needed but i feel slightly longer queue times as a tank while healer i hardly wait
[1:08:47] <+Your_heals> woolieGASM
[1:08:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why?
[1:08:51] <%MisterTylerrr> They let you move on prison planet?
[1:08:56] <%TheWinged7> ah scorps, only fpoders
[1:08:58] <%hereiam407> @VestigeOuroboros Wtf is going on with COD, they haven't given a shit at all
[1:08:58] <JayPastaForce> The moving scorpions?
[1:08:58] <Aydarkzero> it sure did
[1:09:03] <%RealThiele> are they allowed out of prison?
[1:09:03] <commanderapathy> I can't heal for shit, but I'm going to try like hell for sage
[1:09:03] <akitanito> isn't that just australia
[1:09:04] <+Your_heals> Outriders is still up?
[1:09:09] <theanora1> There's a big out out today
[1:09:15] <s1rcuit> this update is like over 3 gigs
[1:09:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> BF2042, talk about it
[1:09:16] <%templar010> Outriders is Destiny from ***
[1:09:17] <@SoFarFetched> thats fair
[1:09:18] <mikeriffic> but the sponsership money pat!
[1:09:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> Plaige
[1:09:18] <theanora1> big one*
[1:09:19] <%barrakuta371> I didn't understand any of that
[1:09:21] <+MoonObscure> i give up on that game so hard... i had high hopes...
[1:09:23] <%hereiam407> Oh right, Outriders
[1:09:24] <%IamGrapes> i really wanted to like Outriders
[1:09:25] <+possumwalsh1221> Same
[1:09:33] <Aydarkzero> you sure got paid
[1:09:34] <%baka_sugoi> woof
[1:09:34] <BarnYardFiddler> Pat where did you get your shirt at ?@patstaresat
[1:09:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> I COULD FEEL THE CRINGE from that demo
[1:09:36] <%Shady_Squid> Shady_Squid subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 30 month streak! Don't know if you talked about it or not yet but does the Endwalker delay worry you at all?
[1:09:36] <theanora1> Square PAID Miabyte to play the update
[1:09:38] <ssks123> so was i
[1:09:38] <+VestigeOuroboros> @hereiam407 Seems like they rushed it to beat out infinite's release date and failed miserably.
[1:09:45] <%captain_thickthighs> outriders is on of the hardest fails ive seen in a while
[1:09:51] <%chance_h> Double the Plague, twice the gripes
[1:09:53] <Lodestarrobot> starting off sage with like 40 abilities unlocked is gonna hurt to learn
[1:09:54] <ssks123> playing that game solo was hell especially if you played at max world level
[1:09:59] <%Monkeyweed21> sasme
[1:09:59] <%sleepystardewfarmer> Cheer500 Do you think Final Fantasy 14 is worth playing by myself? Or is multiplayer 100% necessary?
[1:10:00] <scrumbotime> ........ I completely forgot Outriders existed.
[1:10:01] <ssks123> the game was not balanced for solo play lmao
[1:10:02] <Aydarkzero> Outriders had a weird launch
[1:10:04] <%homelesstwinky> yeah that was a botch
[1:10:04] <%hereiam407> @VestigeOuroboros Everything about it feels subpar
[1:10:05] <$SGrim> What's Outrider?
[1:10:06] <%captain_thickthighs> a on point you character could lose every weapon
[1:10:07] <%templar010> Its a shame because the story and world are actually not bad at all
[1:10:09] <%WhereIsWill> that sucks man
[1:10:09] <ExpressNode> Like won't play it and can't play it
[1:10:16] <ZaCrimsonDragon> obviously you were playing with 2 plauges
[1:10:18] <@Jekado> Same
[1:10:20] <%hereiam407> Where my Bulletstorm 2, People can Fly?
[1:10:22] <%baka_sugoi> one day
[1:10:23] <$JoshManVGH> They SEEM like they've fixed a bunch of their shit. They walked back a bunch of dumb changes. You have unlimited transmog. Made expedition not timed.
[1:10:24] <delerim001> hey did you know about the lol mmo
[1:10:27] <%TheAntiNihilist> @PatStaresAt something something No More Heroes 3?
[1:10:28] <%BogBodyPositive> I'm really sorry Pat. I am on my Wife's account and I think I was having a little bit of a anxiety attack and was obsessively asking same question. I was being an ass. I'm really sorry for spamming the ask.
[1:10:29] <SaltyAzteca> And only when its good. Actually good
[1:10:31] <cartakus> It never happens though
[1:10:31] <@Jekado> outriders had so much potential...
[1:10:32] <%chance_h> @sleepystardewfarmer lol
[1:10:33] <+possumwalsh1221> Same
[1:10:33] <%tusk102> orb ponder
[1:10:35] <Cerabret100> Well the got rid of expedition timers is pretty cool
[1:10:39] <%hereiam407> Blorb up
[1:10:45] <%vaporousTippler> I had more fun with Anthem than Outriders.
[1:10:46] <brachydios777> Is Halo infinite saving FPSs for 2021?
[1:10:47] <ExpressNode> Ponderous Orb
[1:10:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> why does the cover art look like a Saints Row game?
[1:10:50] <%captain_thickthighs> the bugs
[1:10:59] <%hewlettfan96> Piloterons orb
[1:11:02] <%dekkitout> Is Devastator playable in high lvl sutff?
[1:11:04] <theanora1> @PatStaresAt it's a huge update apparently, got a title and everything
[1:11:06] <SaltyAzteca> Fun? In MY videogame? Nope!
[1:11:09] <@Ranryu692> yeah that sucked
[1:11:12] <akitanito> eh, that's sad
[1:11:20] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah! They went through an buffed a bunch of shit trying to get back onto build diversity and shit
[1:11:22] <%MajorCrasher> LUL

[1:11:27] <%MisterRockett> What game was he talking about?
[1:11:29] <cartakus> Wow
[1:11:30] <%Monkeyweed21> @sleepystardewfarmer if you dont mind occasionally teaming up to do dungeons and trials you can totally play XIV as a super long JRPG
[1:11:30] <+humdrumgum> pat if you did get an orb to ponder on stream what color would it be? ie blorb, rorb, porb or gorb?
[1:11:30] <BoneofMalkav> LUL

[1:11:37] <+SnorlaxBud> kabhaaTakemymunneh
[1:11:39] <incredibleCrayon> I played a bit during launch. Ran into so many strange bugs
[1:11:39] <%chance_h> It’s like playing soldier in Mass Effect
[1:11:41] <%hereiam407> Dragonball by Daylight sound sick
[1:11:42] <MusouMiko> Dragon Ball Daylight
[1:11:44] <ChocalateDog203> you got that kinda backwards. bullet builds were OP at first and those got nerfed, that was the most major nerf there ever was
[1:11:48] <vidgmes> DBZBD
[1:11:48] <%MajorCrasher> waitwhat
[1:11:48] <%Treuan> Probably ever
[1:11:49] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Dead By Dragonball
[1:11:52] <%maskofmichael> Since Fighterz
[1:11:52] <Visorak6> Goku's a killer????
[1:11:53] <+MackFighters> FighterZ?
[1:11:53] <%MajorCrasher> what game?
[1:11:54] <fuji_n2> it really is
[1:11:55] <bob900000> Fighterz
[1:11:56] <kidb8> Breakers looks interesting for a Dragonball product.
[1:11:57] <cheap_turbo> but, fighterz
[1:11:58] <+Cobaltor_252> I'm all for a DBZ game that isn't just a fighter
[1:11:58] <@QueequegTheater> Since Buu's Fury
[1:12:00] <skullneedles> since fighterz
[1:12:01] <+CookieCutter007> fighterz have many Goku's
[1:12:02] <Dova573> BUT GOKU THOUGH
[1:12:02] <Hoaxfish> is it supposed to read as "ball breakers"
[1:12:03] <%RealThiele> Dragon Ball busters
[1:12:03] <%hereiam407> Dragon by Deadball
[1:12:04] <+VestigeOuroboros> A horror game being chased by goku sounds terrifying.
[1:12:06] <brachydios777> It’s very difficult
[1:12:06] <rosemon5001> Dragon Ball TTT prop hunt
[1:12:06] <%TheHateFish> Don't you badmouth Budokai Tenkaichi 3 like that
[1:12:06] <%KineticZen> Did they fix the utterly shit story in Outriders
[1:12:07] <ThePimpGuin> but the xenoverse
[1:12:07] <+SnorlaxBud> 7 v 1
[1:12:08] <@SoFarFetched> @BogBodyPositive you really need to be careful with that. Worst thing that could have happened is you get your wife's account accidentally banned.
[1:12:09] <akitanito> Is Mr. Satan a survivor special
[1:12:11] <%baka_sugoi> OOLANG
[1:12:11] <skullneedles> 7 vs 1

[1:12:15] <+D00msDayDan> Slasher Goku

[1:12:24] <%strakillias> Yamcha when nobody is around to see
[1:12:25] <@Jekado> yeah someone gets to be cell
[1:12:27] <total_overkill> Humans, Pat, their called Humans
[1:12:28] <brachydios777> Survive a Cell attack
[1:12:28] <waltzqueen> YAMCHA
[1:12:28] <%maskofmichael> @akitanito He's a killer
[1:12:29] <%chance_h> Lunch?
[1:12:30] <%hereiam407> What if there was a horror game, where you were being hunted by evil Superman through a city?
[1:12:30] <SaltyAzteca> I hope its voiced by taka LUL
[1:12:33] <%tusk102> THATS RAD
[1:12:33] <%dekkitout> Why perfect? Why not Imp Cell?
[1:12:33] <%cvp5127> im gonna main yamcha
[1:12:33] <@Jekado> and if cell gets you he powers up or something
[1:12:33] <%MisterTylerrr> That sounds dope actually
[1:12:35] <%MidnightBurst12> sick
[1:12:36] <Tracazoid> I hope Puar's playable
[1:12:36] <GrokMonkey> Imagine the skins. All those weird graphic tees and shit. Gonna be great.
[1:12:38] <%afronooch> it sounds rads
[1:12:39] <skullneedles> it sounds fun
[1:12:40] <%MajorCrasher> weird but I like the idea
[1:12:40] <%captain_thickthighs> so its evolve with anime?
[1:12:41] <Zeif00> DBZ DBD
[1:12:43] <Daxalog> Its all the cells
[1:12:44] <+possumwalsh1221> That sounds sick what
[1:12:46] <@QueequegTheater> DBZBD
[1:12:46] <%WhereIsWill> never heard of this forreal
[1:12:50] <+Cobaltor_252> @PatStaresAt apparently the win condition is a time machine to grab Goku from the future or something
[1:12:53] <+SnorlaxBud> Come on Launch
[1:12:54] <ExpressNode> But they can't excape. They can blow up the planet
[1:12:54] <Lodestarrobot> they have funny running animations and faces
[1:12:54] <Fenlig> Aww man, what if you were a just a normal human trying to dodge a fight between 2 of those guys
[1:12:56] <cartakus> Can't cell just delete the city?
[1:12:58] <%twistedj3ster> Up the Irons!
[1:13:00] <BarnYardFiddler> DBZD
[1:13:00] <ExpressNode> escape
[1:13:03] <s1rcuit> kinda pointless in a post-freiza arc since all the big bads have power levels that can destroy planets
[1:13:03] <%afronooch> @WhereIsWill it was like just announced today
[1:13:04] <%AHomeschoolDropout> O U T S K I L L E D
[1:13:05] <ThePimpGuin> wonder if it will have a Yamchia upgrade
[1:13:07] <TheBigPutty> it's a good song
[1:13:09] <+Catpurnicus> so literally Waiting for Goko by Daylight
[1:13:13] <%hereiam407> @Fenlig Sick
[1:13:15] <brachydios777> Maybe try to bring a warrior from the future or past
[1:13:23] <%KineticZen> Considering the jpeg background in 5.5's end scene I'd be more concerned ithey didn't delay it
[1:13:23] <%SaiyanShoto> It’s a neat idea but DB fans are pissed cause it’s not “actiony”
[1:13:25] <s1rcuit> @ThePimpGuin you said downgrade wrong
[1:13:26] <%BogBodyPositive> I'm really sorry Pat. I am on my Wife's account and I think I was having a little bit of a anxiety attack and was obsessively asking same question. I was being an ass. I'm really sorry for spamming the ask. Cheer1000
[1:13:32] <%BoocherOnTwitch> The real question is will the new DBZ game allow Launch to crawl out of the deep dark hole that she was dumped in long ago!
[1:13:35] <@QueequegTheater> Yoshi has built up so much benefit of the doubt, it's insane
[1:13:40] <Aydarkzero> oh yeah I just realized that actually
[1:13:54] <+NeonLight> At least til Raubahn EX
[1:14:04] <%Shady_Squid> Coolcoolcool. Got my PTO changed for it already
[1:14:10] <%afronooch> @QueequegTheater he could legitimately steal my wife and I probably forgive him
[1:14:20] <%captain_thickthighs> what about the colonism mmo i heard thats pretty good
[1:14:26] <%BogBodyPositive> I don't know how to include a message on a gifted sub on mobile. it just always gifts the sub and never allows for a message to be added.
[1:14:33] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt wasnt it so stable that you barely had issues when shadowbringers was being ddosd?
[1:14:36] <Fenlig> Gotta find all the dooty
[1:14:43] <+NickHatesSnow> isn't blue mage single player or something?
[1:14:44] <%MugenSandan> and then GET MARRIED
[1:14:45] <%dekkitout> Will eventually join the manifold
[1:14:46] <@SoFarFetched> @BogBodyPositive Sub messages only appear when you are resubbing yourself,not when gifting to other people.
[1:14:46] <@QueequegTheater> @afronooch "He deserves it"
[1:14:47] <randomdude365> Squid1 Squid2 Squid3 Squid4
[1:14:50] <%AncelDeLambert> are you telling me that it's better for a small team that KNOWS how to log bugs is used instead of hoping a sea of monkeys writes a report about what's wrong that makes sense?
[1:14:52] <%hereiam407> @BogBodyPositive Does it pop up with an anniversary message?
[1:14:55] <+Catpurnicus> and if you don't you can tell them its free to play to level 50 etc
[1:15:00] <ZaCrimsonDragon> if you want to play a single player friendly mmo just play phantasy star online 2
[1:15:01] <%Ynkubus_> just say "hi, first time" when doing dungeons/raids
[1:15:02] <@QueequegTheater> pat this implies that anyone I speak to IRL likes videogames

[1:50:04] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Birb pister
[1:50:08] <%thedankestmeeme> ITS THE SPIKER
[1:50:08] <%baka_sugoi> mauler

[1:50:17] <RickyRelucent> spikers were nice to dualwield too
[1:50:17] <Chaos_Aether> Spiker
[1:50:18] <DinoBear_7> Mangler (the one in this one) is like a more balanced CE pistol
[1:50:18] <RickyRelucent> spiker
[1:50:19] <+RyanTheRecluse> it's a good gun
[1:50:19] <Dr_Mooose> needler is good
[1:50:20] <Daxalog> a lot of the superfluous guns got removed
[1:50:20] <%DSD24> Dual Needlers were top tier
[1:50:20] <%valriot> Well yeah its purple
[1:50:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> Needler is cool
[1:50:22] <RickyRelucent> unless u mean the bruteshot
[1:50:23] <MyNameIsRasus> ALSO BIBBLE
[1:50:29] <RickyRelucent> which is the grenade launcher
[1:50:30] <scrumbotime> I want to eat the crystals
[1:50:30] <subjectg> refusing power weapons oh no
[1:50:30] <PersonifiedTFT> its purple and cool and alien
[1:50:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Good gun depending on the game.
[1:50:34] <$ItsRatman> Why Pat hate sniper?
[1:50:36] <RickyRelucent> BRUTESHOT

[1:50:50] <%slimmixrp> Only John Halo can
[1:50:50] <+hush_wolf> good
[1:50:51] <%Monkeyweed21> Jesus was all about stopping space zombies
[1:50:51] <%castlerock42> The Needler is the gun with the biggest identity crisis game to game.
[1:50:51] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt woolies liked the bruteshot which was teh grenade launcher with a blade on the back
[1:50:52] <+MechaEgo> But Pat we are the Jesus
[1:50:52] <rytisone> not since 2
[1:50:52] <+sonofthedeepsouth> They care so much they calles us sinners
[1:50:54] <%PrimalDweeb> Why take away?
[1:50:55] <+Brannax> Nah not since 3
[1:50:55] <+MisterAvry> dual wielding was such an early 2000s thing
[1:50:55] <thesoldierofjoy> Aint been since 3
[1:50:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> That was only 2 and 3
[1:50:56] <dapperskeleton69> patsnipesat
[1:50:59] <%VioletHeart> Hasn't been dual wielding in the series for 15 years.
[1:51:00] <%PhantomMiG> Has not been since 3 @patstaresat
[1:51:00] <Visorak6> nice WHIFF
[1:51:01] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> do you find yourself ignoring the minimap often because i do and get backslapped so much
[1:51:01] <SubjectX07x> The space aliens care TOO MUCH about Jesus and being the chosen people.
[1:51:01] <DinoBear_7> Good luck pat
[1:51:02] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[1:51:04] <cartakus> They care so much that you're the devil
[1:51:06] <%ArthurDayne88> Hell of an echo on that sniper
[1:51:07] <RickyRelucent> nope
[1:51:07] <%dekkitout> Snapshot King makes his comeback
[1:51:07] <dailylifewithry> No dual wielding since 2007
[1:51:09] <mental_mashup> You can 6wield instead
[1:51:10] <%baka_sugoi> Nice
[1:51:10] <Aydarkzero> would have been really funny if that was a headshot right away lmao
[1:51:10] <RickyRelucent> not since 2
[1:51:11] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Pat camps at
[1:51:14] <%Ne1son> Cause you suck??
[1:51:14] <$SGrim> "These scary foreigners have a different religion, and must die!" Halo Lore, American Videogame.
[1:51:15] <Hemmy99> It messed with their thoughts on balance so they wiped it
[1:51:15] <MusouMiko> understandable tbh
[1:51:19] <hat_under_bread> You can spook the shit out of the other team though.
[1:51:24] <DinoBear_7> TBF this sniper is probably the hardest one to use in the series
[1:51:24] <+D00msDayDan> god gamer
[1:51:25] <Baljhet> rooPog
[1:51:27] <%AHomeschoolDropout> You can shoot through the shield from behind btw
[1:51:27] <%Agami23> dont forget you have sheild dealie
[1:51:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> sniper is for good Halos only
[1:51:27] <mental_mashup> Console aim
[1:51:28] <+inktoxicant> xXxsniper_shot_patxXx
[1:51:29] <oniwrath> nice
[1:51:31] <+theswweet> I got like 5 kills in a row with the sniper last night, don't even bother scoping on kb/m
[1:51:31] <%baka_sugoi> CAMP
[1:51:33] <%valriot> "Thats why", get a kill lmao
[1:51:36] <LoreKeeper_Thal> same
[1:51:36] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Its more an old man eyesight and hand eye coodination issue
[1:51:40] <cartakus> sure
[1:51:42] <Aydarkzero> just click their heads 4Head
[1:51:45] <sun312772> The old announcer voices were better
[1:51:48] <LoreKeeper_Thal> that's literally why i don't use snipers in shooters
[1:51:48] <Apollo1818> Sniper bloom in this game is fucking nasty
[1:51:49] <Dustin_Gunn> @PatStaresAt you can move the radar closer to the middle in UI settings
[1:51:55] <RickyRelucent> You just need practice, i snipe in gears and halo but cod always stuffs me
[1:51:58] <%Eaglestrike117> Bro why are you scoping with it
[1:51:58] <Jontman42> yeah just click the enemy
[1:51:59] <+VestigeOuroboros> you can make yourself not bad with the sniper if you just hammer bot games for like 4 hours.
[1:51:59] <+D00msDayDan> it's funny when the sniper rifle spawns but it just sits on the pad for the whole match because everyone's bad with it
[1:52:02] <%captain_thickthighs> he was no where near that reticle
[1:52:07] <SubjectX07x> Oh hey, activate camo removes your motion tracker signature if you just walk.
[1:52:09] <dailylifewithry> So Pat is Church
[1:52:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> you can change sensitivity for every different scope type if that would help
[1:52:15] <SubjectX07x> Didn't notice that before, nice.
[1:52:16] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Campers shouldnt be allowed to exist really
[1:52:18] <shotguncrucifix> snapshotking is a scrub with the sniper
[1:52:19] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Kappa
[1:52:21] <+embranz> yeah do it
[1:52:22] <+sonofthedeepsouth> No
[1:52:25] <Ranger747> absolutely
[1:52:25] <MyNameIsRasus> That was sick
[1:52:26] <Baljhet> sure
[1:52:26] <chainsaw105> there's a medal for 360 no scopes
[1:52:29] <ergulor> buttsnipe him
[1:52:29] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> yeah shoot him in the butt

[1:52:31] <infernalram> yeah thats fine
[1:52:33] <Aydarkzero> hey it works
[1:52:34] <%captain_thickthighs> yep

[1:52:36] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> LUL LUL LUL
[1:52:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah that works
[1:52:38] <Jontman42> can you even 0 degree scope him tho
[1:52:40] <%ChrisPlaysThing> BXR Fucker
[1:52:40] <+pyurient> Skyrim belongs to the Nords
[1:52:41] <VirtuaRailith> Is paige the one doing the announcer?
[1:52:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> dude, as long as you're having fun, do whatever.

[1:52:49] <%SWFanatic> Purple fell over
[1:52:49] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> I joined and all I heard before the ad was 360 shoot him in the butt
[1:52:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> a pistol or BR might work better than the AR tho
[1:52:55] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:52:55] <%baka_sugoi> +1
[1:53:05] <Aydarkzero> that nade belongs there
[1:53:05] <+VestigeOuroboros> I strongly recommend that anyone with aiming issues with the sniper, set their "look" deadzones to 0 aside from axial. It makes it feel a lot better and smoother.
[1:53:09] <+sonofthedeepsouth> 1.1K/D pog
[1:53:15] <%strakillias> There is a shotgun in the tunnel
[1:53:17] <MyNameIsRasus> Paige was carrying
[1:53:26] <+DeaconBluesClues> here lies boivan. he never scored
[1:53:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> to my understanding, the lady is an AI, which you can choose the voice/representation for, I think?
[1:53:31] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Nah, brought it so far down you reached the smurfer tier
[1:53:34] <infernalram> if you pick up pulse carbine enemy team gets a complementary kill!
[1:53:34] <willyfreshness> Why does the AI sound like Paige?
[1:53:35] <DinoBear_7> Yes
[1:53:43] <JayPastaForce> Don't worry pat, your Mucho Mustache Rating is the same

[1:59:08] <%notsoy> headshots only do more damage once the shield is down, right?
[1:59:14] <goulguts> I was expecting hot garbage gameplay after the podcast discussion but Pat is totally fine at shooting in the shooty game
[1:59:22] <%dekkitout> @DSD24 Controller learning curves are just straight up kinder

[2:02:40] <+MrIntake> this one map is good for oddball tbh
[2:02:41] <+Double_Tap_That> I actually like Oddball, at least in Splitgate.
[2:02:44] <chainsaw105> I'd like it more if the skull was a one-hit kill
[2:02:46] <%castlerock42> I was good at oddball so i loved it.

[2:09:18] <+inktoxicant> If you ponder the orb long enough you win the game
[2:09:19] <delerim001> that is a nice looking skull
[2:09:21] <culturesh0ck> 'ball control' like edging right?
[2:09:21] <+cmdrmobium> ball control is important in November
[2:09:22] <%hereiam407> Don't squeeze it
[2:09:22] <%barrakuta371> That ball looks oddly like fmaing skull
[2:09:22] <%KnifeyMcEdge> Pat sure does know how to handle his ball... just one though
[2:09:23] <%Valdorick> Controling the ball
[2:09:24] <+tempestzephyr> Yeah Lame it Out!

[2:09:45] <Bananuhs> When did the Halo announcers get so quirky?
[2:09:46] <%hereiam407> Half a round skull a ball does not make
[2:09:46] <primaryfire> paige would be great at this
[2:09:47] <luciluxlu0> you attack faster tho
[2:09:48] <+nial_evol> hitting with ball fucks dudes up in 2 hits wym
[2:09:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> Sweet Southern Lady Saying Cool Shit is always fun.
[2:09:54] <%KnifeyMcEdge> i think you punch a little faster though
[2:09:54] <jadedguy> hold the ball
[2:09:54] <choocheess> this game looks like crack
[2:09:55] <mental_mashup> Teammates have no ball control
[2:09:57] <%Monkeyweed21> it kills if they lose shield
[2:09:59] <mr_mister0> what if we could throw the ball
[2:10:02] <dan_g_v> that John Halo had stink lines on his butt
[2:10:08] <choocheess> nice

[2:10:44] <dan_g_v> big wins!
[2:10:44] <%espanishcanamurciana> we did it chat
[2:10:45] <Latija> is the pistol any good?
[2:10:46] <+Sirius_6> Yeah, devs pointed out that the ball doesn't OHKO but has a faster melee animation to compensate a bit
[2:10:46] <%hereiam407> Somethings missing, like a grunt running around calling you all demons
[2:10:48] <+inktoxicant> owned
[2:10:48] <Treasure_Vault> nice oddball

[2:12:09] <choocheess> @TrollKing96 LUL
[2:12:10] <%KnifeyMcEdge> Medium?

[2:12:12] <+MrIntake> yeah i set it to low no difference really
[2:12:16] <$Wnds> I play on Low settings and this doesn't look that different.
[2:12:20] <culturesh0ck> ikr
[2:12:21] <%valriot> Just run it at framerate
[2:12:25] <Davimotion96> probably memetracing
[2:12:26] <%Monkeyweed21> the difficulty of the graphics is VERY HIGH
[2:12:28] <+CrimsonDio11> @PatStaresAt dont you have a 3080? why would it recommend medium?
[2:12:33] <%captain_thickthighs> meduim what are we console gamers?
[2:12:34] <dan_g_v> double ko
[2:12:45] <+inktoxicant> makes sense

[2:12:47] <wakeupsuper12> damn double
[2:12:48] <Aydarkzero> yep
[2:12:48] <%KnifeyMcEdge> looks good on my Series X
[2:12:50] <castlerock42> Pat trades more than Pokémon card collectors.
[2:12:55] <%greasypete00> 2k would probably be fine tho?
[2:12:56] <%TheBensonator_> FACTS
[2:12:58] <+Sirius_6> Nice double
[2:12:58] <primaryfire> it set itself to low for me and I have a 3080 and a 1700x at 1440p

[2:13:48] <dan_g_v> that guy couldn't be the ball
[2:13:48] <@Ranryu692> just a reminder that if you got a kill streak with the shotgun in the Halo 3 Multiplayer Beta you got a medal called "Cheney-mania"
[2:13:54] <%hereiam407> Is it bad when I play Forza Horizon at 4k, the ground textures start to turn purple and green?

[2:14:54] <cartakus> How close are the spartans to space marines?
[2:14:55] <%solracc25> Pat carries At
[2:14:56] <%MugenSandan> how's it feel being the biggest Halo fan to ever exist
[2:14:57] <+inktoxicant> feels like a good the halo
[2:14:58] <+thebetterbard> What were you? THE BALL?
[2:15:04] <SantosPls> pat is new fav halo streamer
[2:15:06] <primaryfire> @Yakobro weird stuff
[2:15:07] <+VestigeOuroboros> @patstaresat A tip: rockets are for aiming for feet and nearby walls, not people. The explosion radius is huge enough to kill but not if the rocket flies past them and keeps going.
[2:15:11] <+MrIntake> LUL
[2:15:13] <+MisterAvry> I bet with a little more practice Paige will be pretty good at the Halo
[2:15:13] <+MoonObscure> lol
[2:15:16] <%shurtal> i like how in canon, the human tech has been developing at a ludicrously fast pace, but their handguns get worse and worse, for "reasons"
[2:15:18] <Fenlig> Are controllers and Mouse & Keyboard players Splt up?
[2:15:19] <%hereiam407> Halo is a ring, and completes me
[2:15:19] <dan_g_v> maybe we were all the ball
[2:15:22] <Visorak6> The only way to progress the pass is through missions? Ugh, gross
[2:15:30] <AluxDoesNotStream> Jumping in Halo is strong generally.
[2:15:31] <%athuramn> this battlepass is so hard to level up
[2:15:31] <bear_breaker20> right so weird
[2:15:31] <subjectg> shouldn’t objective and slayer modes be separated?
[2:15:32] <%Logoth_> psaDogchamp
[2:15:34] <%Pyrojak> is the multiplayer free to play?
[2:15:35] <%BinaryFireball> I miss ut2004 rockets
[2:15:36] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Tip: Use the repulser to double your grenade range by htiting it as soon as you throw them
[2:15:37] <cpt_langosta> gief bork at lies
[2:15:37] <thewrathofscience> He Borkin
[2:15:38] <+D00msDayDan> if only you chould choose which specific modes to queue for like in MCC
[2:15:38] <+VestigeOuroboros> lol long as you know, they can also be shot out of the air with an AR.
[2:15:39] <%BinaryFireball> only rockets for me
[2:15:39] <%Felhad> God Halo 1 rockets were slow
[2:15:40] <%cade_calrayn> gief can sense your lies
[2:15:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> Does the rocket lock on in this one?
[2:15:42] <%CappuccinoGuil> How many? THIS many?
[2:15:44] <choocheess> you should totally play 1-3 story mode!
[2:15:45] <%MugenSandan> GIGANTIC HALO GAMER PatStaresAt
[2:15:47] <%KnifeyMcEdge> I'm just thinking to myself "its a beta, they'll add gametype choices later"
[2:15:47] <Ravioli_Ronin> Feel like halo rockets used to have bigger splash damage
[2:15:49] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Other games make it real easy to direct impact infantry, yeah
[2:15:50] <infernalram> @visorak6 ya but they are working to chamge that

[2:16:16] <+Your_heals> Is there a server browser please?
[2:16:19] <akitanito> that's rare in modern day

[2:16:26] <bear_breaker20> good on them fuck large files
[2:16:27] <primaryfire> gief is still mad over getting his balls dropped
[2:16:27] <Minorou> remember when games were mocked for being 10 GB
[2:16:27] <%cade_calrayn> my desktop's graphics card doesn't have the RAM required
[2:16:28] <+MrIntake> FREE99
[2:16:29] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> If you have Windows 10, you probably have a microsoft account

[2:16:30] <%cade_calrayn> and my Xbone died
[2:16:31] <@Ranryu692> I'm playing the Shadowbringers MSQ, that seems like a better use of my time
[2:16:31] <%CappuccinoGuil> What if I don't like PvP stuff?
[2:16:31] <Dr_Mooose> get on the grind!
[2:16:32] <AllenDeadman> straight up less storage than apex
[2:16:32] <dw420_dylan> I wish there were separate slayer and objective playlists. Hopefully it’s added soon
[2:16:32] <cartakus> If you don't have gokd
[2:16:33] <bear_breaker20> prolly will expand tho...
[2:16:33] <+D00msDayDan> 18gb if you disable high resolution textures under DLC management

[2:16:43] <cartakus> gold fuck
[2:16:44] <Redmannasah> It feels weird to shill, but for real, like, it's free, just try it out and uninstall when you're bored

[2:17:24] <%Agami23> it crashed my graphics card so i cant play. sad

[2:17:25] <$OranHexthief> @GarbageNirvana my laptop 1070 and 7700hq is more than enough. solid 60 though that might be because of my monitor only being 60 hz

[2:18:41] <dapperskeleton69> halo now a horror game
[2:18:42] <mikesapartment> sprinting shows your location btw
[2:18:43] <%SirGO0SE> atpCap
[2:18:45] <DinoBear_7> Sprint is basically there for sliding, moving faster with melee and objectives, and throwing things that you can throw farther.
[2:18:45] <akitanito> yeyeye
[2:18:48] <+inktoxicant> noice
[2:18:50] <primaryfire> you got the grappling hook
[2:18:52] <%hereiam407> @dapperskeleton69 Always was
[2:18:54] <Bananuhs> the survival horror halo game
[2:18:57] <Jim_Placebo> HE JUST MIGHT GO ALL THE WAY
[2:19:04] <%KnifeyMcEdge> USE GRAPPLESHOT
[2:19:06] <dan_g_v> can't catch the Orb man can't get the flag and then gets killed by Orb Man, that poor guy

[2:19:20] <%inCideousOne> sprinting while holding the flag
[2:19:20] <+acridpaladin> sprinting
[2:19:21] <primaryfire> moving while standing

[2:19:23] <+D00msDayDan> moving and shooting reveal you
[2:19:24] <+Double_Tap_That> Sprinting
[2:19:25] <%Pyrojak> new announcer sounds kinda weird
[2:19:27] <cpt_langosta> lol jinxed
[2:19:28] <thebalticguy1> like 1.1
[2:19:29] <+nial_evol> like 10%
[2:19:29] <dan_g_v> Pat is practically carrying the team
[2:19:30] <delerim001> like 3%
[2:19:30] <brachydios777> Sprint
[2:19:32] <%Monkeyweed21> 10%
[2:19:32] <finnystreams> @ECRead pretty sure the game won't even allow you to play it, this game has blacklisted graphics card in its files that will crash your game even if you try to boot it up
[2:19:33] <akitanito> not fast enough to avoid bullets
[2:19:34] <%valriot> not very
[2:19:34] <cybz99> barely much
[2:19:34] <%barrakuta371> 3%
[2:19:38] <Davimotion96> about 5% faster
[2:19:40] <silywiggles> any moving. they changed it back
[2:19:41] <%KnifeyMcEdge> He hasnt used any equipment yet has he?
[2:19:41] <subjectg> You can probably hide yourself really well by crouch walking
[2:19:42] <brachydios777> 3%
[2:19:45] <marvel877> Sprinting, it literally says it in the middle of the screen while youre holding the flag, Pat.
[2:19:49] <+MrIntake> moving but the radar is small range so if you see red dot then they are super close to you
[2:19:50] <%valriot> Its good for hiding and long distances
[2:19:50] <cartakus> I would play harder if gura was screaming in my ear
[2:19:51] <Redmannasah> It's less for the speed but more for the utility for slides
[2:19:52] <%afronooch> yeah but sliding tho
[2:19:55] <%SirGO0SE> @Pyrojak its really offputting
[2:20:01] <%SirGO0SE> sounds like a Borderlands VA
[2:20:09] <+RyanTheRecluse> a fair bit faster when you're carrying an objective but not much when you aren't
[2:20:15] <+trackles_64> Run pat
[2:20:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> that dude was right next to you for so long LUL
[2:20:33] <%KnifeyMcEdge> you can choose different AI to announce stuff @PatStaresAt
[2:20:39] <+MrIntake> better spartan wins
[2:20:41] <%twistedj3ster> This map just unlocked an old Tribes memory
[2:20:41] <cpt_langosta> "Hold RT to fire bullets from the gun."
[2:20:43] <+trackles_64> such a cool effect
[2:20:44] <thelonechris> It's like it's 2007 again
[2:20:47] <%hereiam407> Do all of the power ups have animations when applying them?
[2:20:48] <%espanishcanamurciana> Good argument Pat, unfortunately the announcer has a quirky voice
[2:20:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> see how invisible you are?
[2:20:53] <Gray_LoFi> You're basically invisible without sprinting in my experience
[2:20:55] <+Celarious> Bruh that's not active camo that's just invisibility
[2:20:55] <subjectg> If there’s one thing i wanna say is that the red outlines make it hard to hide though

[2:21:37] <MaybeFalco> literally 1hp

[2:21:58] <primaryfire> gotta listen for footsteps

[2:22:30] <bear_breaker20> looks like a black armory weapon

[2:22:36] <+trackles_64> weapon pick ups suuck

[2:23:00] <+trackles_64> L
[2:23:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> THE FEET
[2:23:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah the scope is real
[2:23:03] <cpt_langosta> it must be to ensure sick noscopes
[2:23:03] <sozemd> it is

[2:23:04] <+memephantom> What a team player pat lul
[2:23:04] <finnystreams> the sniper rifle is extremely accurate
[2:23:05] <DinoBear_7> It does feel like the ravager was nerfed
[2:23:05] <Melchior_the_Wise> Da Feet
[2:23:05] <%dekkitout> There's gotta be hipfire accuracy- it's 2021
[2:23:06] <+thecosmicfly> Da feet
[2:23:08] <%optimasmaximas> yes
[2:23:13] <finnystreams> even when hipfiring
[2:23:14] <Cykaima> its laser accurate but has no auto aim
[2:23:16] <+pandapeeps> pandapeeps subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Love to see Halo again

[2:23:48] <+D00msDayDan> the sniper rifle is hard to use because it's too accurate

[2:23:52] <Baljhet> yes, Pat, embrace noscoping
[2:24:01] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> @trackles_64 its a free Battle pass
[2:24:05] <%MugenSandan> I do not feel particularly for or against this music
[2:24:06] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> @puhff Be kinda hyperbolic if the losing music was better than the winning stuff
[2:24:11] <subjectg> halo has always been pretty good about the reticules indicating how accurate they are

[2:34:19] <+polothegreatest> suck it blue
[2:34:22] <marvel877> Private Jimmy beaten to death with his own skull
[2:34:23] <%psidefx> Jimmy Andersmith
[2:34:23] <slatersev> Jimmy got beaten to death with his own skull
[2:34:23] <%FunkyStreams> which isn;t saying much.
[2:34:24] <dan_g_v> oh, big numbers!
[2:34:24] <Daxalog> Whens FFA?
[2:34:31] <GarbageNirvana> @Melchior_the_Wise Yeah, if you analyze the name of the band itself and the lyrics to their songs there's a lot of Nazi and anti-Semitic undertones
[2:34:32] <dan_g_v> coffee break!
[2:34:38] <+inktoxicant> the ol father son pee break
[2:34:39] <culturesh0ck> I cant believe John Halo defeated John Halo
[2:34:42] <%dekkitout> Father son pee break
[2:34:48] <slatersev> @cpt_langosta Jimmy is as old school RVB as possible
[2:34:54] <slatersev> thats a joke from fucking episode 9
[2:34:56] <Botman_R> Ugh...you have to unlock colors individually?
[2:35:23] <%tusk102> @Botman_R its color preset palettes via battlepass
[2:35:30] <%BinaryFireball> finally downloaded
[2:35:36] <%tusk102> i dont doubt they'll be making changes to how stuff is unlocked
[2:35:38] <%athuramn> @botman_r you get like 6 colors unlocked by default
[2:35:44] <%BinaryFireball> which means paige should be able to download and kick pat's ass
[2:35:46] <leinadtonu> So... Is it true what they say about master chief's suit?
[2:35:50] <NitronStreams> yeah customization kinda sucks ass
[2:35:57] <%dekkitout> Oh, spooder meg trailer's out
[2:36:14] <+memephantom> Price to pay for free to play nature of the game
[2:36:17] <%tusk102> they should go the mcc route of being able to pick what you unlock and then have the battlepass be super special stuff like character gear and things like that
[2:36:22] <%FunkyStreams> Far From Home's is?
[2:36:40] <%dekkitout> Which else
[2:36:50] <%athuramn> @tusk102 i don't think they'll change it tbh because a lot of their marketing went towards chips and drinks having double exp codes and boosts and shit
[2:37:04] <%tusk102> hmm
[2:37:14] <%tusk102> i feel like they'll just give match xp then
[2:37:20] <%tusk102> like 25 per match or smth
[2:37:31] <%FunkyStreams> I hope they give Sam Raimi a cameo, its only right.
[2:37:34] <%athuramn> I hope so because I'm not good enough to win matches for exp D;
[2:38:10] <%tusk102> well lucky for you the daily challenge that seems to be infinitely respawning is just "play matches"
[2:38:23] <%tusk102> the one that gives 150
[2:38:37] <%tusk102> also im starting to get challenges that award 250 instead of 200
[2:38:41] <%athuramn> oh that's infinite? nicee
[2:38:56] <%tusk102> it appears to respawn everytime i complete it
[2:39:04] <%tusk102> i've completed it like 30 times lol
[2:39:13] <%athuramn> *gasp* so that's why it's called infinite...
[2:39:16] <slix3431> Did Pat fight someone called Wedding Tea?
[2:39:38] <silywiggles> they do need to add xp for every match played to go along with the daily
[2:39:54] <%tusk102> im having a hard time with one of the missions tbh which is to repulse someone off a map
[2:40:12] <%tusk102> @silywiggles even if it was just like 25 xp it would feel better
[2:40:13] <%hereiam407> J-Lo
[2:40:13] <cpt_langosta> welcome back to Microsoft Bob!
[2:40:16] <lazypointer> The fortnite man?

[2:41:10] <silywiggles> yeah, i think 50 or 75 would work better. 25 is still 40 matches to go up once

[2:47:35] <%FFXIVsFreeTrial> happens to me every time I go into customization menu
[2:47:37] <+polothegreatest> LUMU A.I is the best
[2:47:42] <+cmdrmobium> sound is dying
[2:47:44] <+VestigeOuroboros> It actually locks it to 40 on loading screens so perhaps it just bugged out
[2:47:46] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> This game is really not that well optimized
[2:47:59] <cpt_langosta> no pat, that was a gun bugs look different and have more legs
[2:48:01] <Azathotic> Anyone else's game randomly crashing on respawning?
[2:48:03] <cricket42069> gotta have my colors!!

[2:48:29] <%A_Zealous_Retort> listen... the menu is REALLY pretty and its kinda graphics intense

[2:48:36] <%cade_calrayn> Angry Gief
[2:48:38] <+dreadsnappi> It sucks the XP you get from playing the game doesn’t go to the battle pass seems kind of fucking stupid
[2:48:50] <keatiestofthegribbles> i prefer big team battles
[2:48:53] <BusterWoIf> Are ya winning, Pat?
[2:49:00] <keatiestofthegribbles> the chaos is fun
[2:49:03] <+Sirius_6> 30fps and the one-earpiece headset, it's like it's 2004 all over again
[2:49:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> too sweaty
[2:49:22] <dawarw0lf> I love BTB but I'm much worse at it
[2:49:25] <cpt_langosta> splitting sound makes controller dusty?

[2:49:58] <%A_Zealous_Retort> Pat EVERYONE is terrible at BTB
[2:50:00] <%justcallmebobplease> Sound is too slow, can you make it faster?
[2:50:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> BTB is all about chaos
[2:50:02] <+D00msDayDan> that's the beauty of BTB, being terrible barely matters because the rest of your team is also terrible
[2:50:04] <+VestigeOuroboros> The sound is too old
[2:50:06] <sweatch0> too fast
[2:50:06] <cricket42069> the colorless dudes lmao
[2:50:06] <dapperskeleton69> where's that hot new mlg gamer PatSmellz

[2:51:05] <huskarl_zap> fazecoin ItsHappening RyuChamp
[2:51:06] <%reaver93> It's 3am, Im off to bed, night Pat, Paige, Gief and Elmo!
[2:51:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> man even the ragdolls are right, this game is good
[2:51:15] <dawarw0lf> @tusk102 I have tried telling people that on reddit to no avail. we don't need match xp we need more of it
[2:51:21] <cricket42069> "wee havetheball!"
[2:51:25] <%athuramn> man this aim assist is disgusting
[2:51:25] <%twistedj3ster> is Pat ragging on her cord?
[2:51:28] <huskarl_zap> theres a lady voice in my head telling me im sexy
[2:51:44] <%G_Thunders> It’s kinda weird having these two AI nearly talking over each other
[2:51:46] <M0untain_wolf> Aim assist is high...
[2:51:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> @athuramn yeah that's Halo
[2:51:56] <nintega010> that lady voice sounds like paige
[2:51:56] <keatiestofthegribbles> theres a lady in my head that calls me stud muffin
[2:52:04] <JehutyVer2> AI sounds like the Tower from Automata
[2:52:12] <slix3431> @PatStaresAt FUCK Pat are you right about this game being made for controller
[2:52:12] <cricket42069> pretty hilarious how robotically delighted they sound
[2:52:21] <%RealThiele> gief hate gun
[2:52:29] <+kylejefferies> Hey Pat you can kinda  make the view model of the gun smaller under the UI settings.
[2:52:31] <@Ranryu692> yeah; it's Halo
[2:52:32] <%athuramn> @reallybigrocks it's my first online halo so I never really noticed but Holy
[2:52:32] <%Cykron> Pat playing Halo on stream has given me the confidence to have fun playing multiplayer games badly
[2:52:37] <%G_Thunders> Yeah the lady AI gives me Borderlands vibes
[2:52:38] <dmtjinni> wat
[2:52:50] <M0untain_wolf> I kinda dont like that secondary announcer
[2:52:53] <%Monkeyweed21> Halo has a SHITLOAD of aim assist
[2:52:53] <%RealThiele> 20gb install also means mobile is within possibility
[2:53:00] <culturesh0ck> oh yeah view models are adjustable which is neat
[2:53:00] <cpt_langosta> when a fuan shaves: smooth pan
[2:53:04] <%SWFanatic> The psaDogchamp goes "Bork"
[2:53:09] <%FunkyStreams> also had hitbox gravity
[2:53:09] <%SovPho> @M0untain_wolf There's a male one that's less happy-go-lucky
[2:53:13] <@QueequegTheater> Any announcer that isn't the classic one is bad
[2:53:13] <%FunkyStreams> has
[2:53:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> yo was that guy passin balls?
[2:53:27] <%athuramn> @realthiele lmfao
[2:53:31] <+kylejefferies> Yeah, I have my view model at 100%, -100%, -100%
[2:53:35] <dapperskeleton69> gief need his MAMA
[2:53:39] <keatiestofthegribbles> classic halo being one hit by flag or skull = instant kill
[2:53:41] <dawarw0lf> @queequegtheater good thing the Classic is always there
[2:53:41] <RGBgamesinc> I think she haruko from flcl??
[2:53:45] <scrambledxeggz> Ok bear with me here. Pat is a gender bent Rosey O'Donell
[2:53:49] <+kylejefferies> Go to UI settings
[2:53:53] <culturesh0ck> gun position on screen
[2:53:54] <infernalram> it means the weapon offset
[2:53:56] <Srthunda> man, those ragdolls are taking me back to 2008
[2:53:59] <%notsoy> no, he's not racist enough
[2:54:04] <neroforte177> fov settings?
[2:54:05] <%Cykron> I like AI P.A.I.G.E.
[2:54:08] <+kevlarkoala> is he playing the Haloz with Da Controllerz?
[2:54:09] <@QueequegTheater> @scrambledxeggz No, Pat is entertaining
[2:54:13] <+kylejefferies> If you go to UI settings you can move where the gun model is on screen.
[2:54:21] <dapperskeleton69> PONDER ORB
[2:54:21] <slix3431> Is this New Mombasa?

[2:55:04] <+Fefe41> The AI sounds like a voiceover for a trojan commercial
[2:55:06] <JehutyVer2> grifball is a totally different game
[2:55:07] <%SvenHolgersson> G A M E R
[2:55:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> @ScrapKingKeita grifball has always been a different thing
[2:55:08] <+inktoxicant> YOU PONDERED THE ORB
[2:55:08] <%Puhff> it's a skull orb: both of paige's weaknesses combined
[2:55:09] <%SWFanatic> MercyWing1 psaDogchamp MercyWing2 "Bork" sayeth the Pupper
[2:55:10] <%Cykron> He just killed me in PUBS and went back to pondering his Orb
[2:55:10] <%RealThiele> that AI is just paige i keep expecting it to talk about mold or puzzles
[2:55:10] <+kylejefferies> Griffball is a different game.
[2:55:11] <willyfreshness> this game really needs fortnite dances
[2:55:11] <%athuramn> why has no one thrown a grenade at pats enclosed space
[2:55:11] <cpt_langosta> you...... did it.

[2:57:22] <SpookyMooks> LUL
[2:57:23] <+kylejefferies> @patstaresat since you asked, the 100%s I was talking about are at the bottom of UI settings, and let you move the gun model on screen.

[2:57:43] <keatiestofthegribbles> also a KI reference
[2:57:45] <%athuramn> this really makes me wonder if any of the people who used to rave about how good they were at halo, were actually good
[2:57:50] <+kylejefferies> I just changed the color of the outline.
[2:57:52] <Fenlig> I'm really looking forward to the coop after this
[2:57:59] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@cricket42069) (warning)
[2:58:04] <+kylejefferies> made it a less bright red.
[2:58:05] <M0untain_wolf> Needler gun!
[2:58:06] <%A_Zealous_Retort> not to mention when you shoot them they god BRIGHT red too
[2:58:14] <+HolePunchLeaf> SLAPPED
[2:58:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah it lets you keep customization and team colors
[2:58:18] <+VestigeOuroboros> I think that's the first time I've seen a single person get a kill with a needler in like 100 hours of this game.
[2:58:21] <dawarw0lf> friend or for js great. I can't play without it
[2:58:31] <@TheYellowcouch> especially when they take damage and light up red like Christmas
[2:58:37] <graemecrackers2> GG

[2:59:00] <dapperskeleton69> pat stop talking about your balls popping
[2:59:04] <dawarw0lf> teal vs orange for ms

[3:00:43] <culturesh0ck> invert gun model
[3:00:44] <+kylejefferies> you can actually make it take up like 45% of the screen.
[3:00:44] <%Ynkubus_> Your asking halo chat to have more than a braincell
[3:00:46] <Buttku> so you can show us something new and different patt

[3:01:45] <+YabbaTroll> btw dumb question about the customization, are custom combinations of emblems and and armor colors just not a thing anymore?

[3:03:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Pat's Spartan looks like a fucking Gundam
[3:03:10] <%RealThiele> quality aim
[3:03:18] <DomunDomunDomun> Better than MCC where you get timed out for crashing once.
[3:03:25] <+VestigeOuroboros> If you look above the weapon holders, there's a progress bar to the next one spawning.
[3:03:25] <M0untain_wolf> seems like the net code is solid
[3:03:32] <akitanito> stronk
[3:03:33] <%hereiam407> Zangief looks like a genetically modified super dog
[3:03:34] <WanderingYoren> the weapon racks have a blue bar above that indicates how long until it respawns
[3:03:38] <dapperskeleton69> does active camop run out?

[3:04:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> he wants to play
[3:04:08] <+smallboops> its actually starting to bother me...
[3:04:11] <+VestigeOuroboros> can't hear dog, if it was a crying baby it would be a problem.
[3:04:12] <@QueequegTheater> Pick him up and swaddle him like a baby

[3:04:33] <anAngryHamster> Does Infinite have Gun Game?
[3:04:34] <SpookyMooks> giving us the lovely borks
[3:04:34] <%hereiam407> @TioXyco They can't remove your brain testicles

[3:04:56] <culturesh0ck> @anAngryHamster not now, maybe in the future
[3:04:57] <Admiral_PopnFresh> no PC?
[3:04:58] <WanderingYoren> it is nice to shoot a man with the gun in Microsoft's heigh lowe
[3:05:11] <%tusk102> i wonder if the gun variety is limited because they have more in the campaign and dont want to add them to multiplayer yet
[3:05:23] <dapperskeleton69> cant wait until we get elmo screaming, gief barking and paige and a baby crying in the bg while pat plays halo

[3:06:23] <%G_Thunders> How embarrassing
[3:06:24] <AluxDoesNotStream> Only lunges when your reticle is red.
[3:06:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> reticule needs to be red
[3:06:27] <%Cykron> YOU NEED TO AIM THE RETICLE WILL TURN RED
[3:06:28] <+Sirius_6> The ragdoll arm flail had so much emotion to it LUL
[3:06:28] <@QueequegTheater> Reticle has to turn red
[3:06:29] <@Spydurman> retical has to be red
[3:06:31] <$stub_master> if the crosshair is red it lunges
[3:06:31] <Cykaima> red crosshair
[3:06:37] <zerointelligence000> redeem yourself
[3:06:38] <marvel877> Reticule needs to be red, Pat
[3:06:38] <%hereiam407> What a noob
[3:06:39] <+monfo_the_great> The ret turns red when you're close enough for the lunge to happen
[3:06:43] <Jim_Placebo> he did it!
[3:06:45] <dawarw0lf> rookie mistake
[3:06:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> same thing with the needler homing
[3:06:45] <Admiral_PopnFresh> DID HE NOT KNOW?
[3:06:48] <$stub_master> balls are out
[3:06:51] <cricket42069> yeees delicious
[3:06:52] <dapperskeleton69> use da grapple
[3:06:52] <graemecrackers2> Its geifs turn on the xbox
[3:06:53] <marvel877> Need to be in range for it to work
[3:06:56] <Ranger747> i thought that was Paige
[3:06:57] <%athuramn> this yellow h2o guy is the most lost player I've ever seen
[3:07:04] <$stub_master> YELLOWW??
[3:07:05] <%hereiam407> The gun also shoots if you hold the R button
[3:07:06] <%orochiblood> is this pc or console
[3:07:06] <+D00msDayDan> yellow means you can grapple
[3:07:07] <culturesh0ck> that was a hammer spawn in the flight, is that just for this playlist or is it always sword now?
[3:07:13] <marvel877> Yellow?
[3:07:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> yellow!?!?!?! When was it EVER yellow??
[3:07:16] <+polothegreatest> pc
[3:07:21] <akitanito> now you're learning
[3:07:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> it was
[3:07:27] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt yellow is grapple
[3:07:29] <%athuramn> it also means crit, but not as crit as red
[3:07:30] <akitanito> pfft
[3:07:31] <ZeeJiggle> Ok, so reticle go away cause sprinting.
[3:07:33] <+Cobaltor_252> IN THE SAME SPOT
[3:07:34] <M0untain_wolf> oof
[3:07:34] <+D00msDayDan> @culturesh0ck each map has different weapon spawn configurations
[3:07:34] <Cykaima> GET IT
[3:07:37] <%hereiam407> I love the ragdolls
[3:07:38] <SinisterBroccoli> Don't think it turns red when you spint
[3:07:40] <@QueequegTheater> Same spot lmao
[3:07:41] <@TheYellowcouch> it's the white that needs to turn red
[3:07:41] <+kofibeens> When you sprint the reticule you're looking for disappears. The little yellow dot means you have grapple equipment.
[3:07:45] <+monfo_the_great> It has to do with the animation after a sprint
[3:07:53] <Crimpson> Red does the lunge.  You were just swinging it when next to them and it still hurts.
[3:07:55] <slix3431> Dude it's Aeden! Woolie's Fave
[3:07:59] <%hereiam407> What is going onnnn?!
[3:08:00] <marvel877> I thought Pat's colorblindness only was with Blue/Purple?
[3:08:01] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the reticle turns yellow when you can hit them with the grappleshot
[3:08:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> someing about the AR run to Elbow slam, so classic
[3:08:17] <+polothegreatest> melee is no lunge, trigger is lunge
[3:08:24] <%tusk102> you did
[3:08:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeh
[3:08:27] <WanderingYoren> who's talking?!
[3:08:43] <cpt_langosta> protip: a grapple is either a grape-sized apple, or an apple-sized grape
[3:08:44] <%hereiam407> Each map carries a story with it. This one is saying 'kill'
[3:08:54] <dapperskeleton69> t-bagged
[3:08:55] <+Cobaltor_252> what a shitter
[3:08:57] <+VestigeOuroboros> that guy bagged at him.

[3:18:37] <%orochiblood> no you'
[3:18:37] <AluxDoesNotStream> It's for peeling shields.
[3:18:37] <+RedQueensAce> it sucks
[3:18:40] <total_overkill> git gud
[3:18:40] <+VestigeOuroboros> It's only  good at long range.
[3:18:42] <G03933> hit them
[3:18:44] <@QueequegTheater> I can't believe Goro Akechi is your AI
[3:18:44] <%optimasmaximas> pulse carvine sucks
[3:18:44] <+Avossk_> its a mid ranged gun
[3:18:45] <%Monkeyweed21> Chris Pratt voices Robbie Daymond
[3:18:46] <BrandNewNikes> LuL
[3:18:46] <%RealThiele> stop using it
[3:18:47] <infernalram> pulse carbine just sucks, dont pick it up
[3:18:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah it's not great, better for medium range because of homing
[3:18:50] <cs0402196> pulse carbine suck
[3:18:51] <%optimasmaximas> that gun sucks big
[3:18:51] <graemecrackers2> Blue ball is sticky
[3:18:52] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt its for long range
[3:18:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> why did they change carbine to burst, smh
[3:18:53] <%AnthroMetal> 'that gun is for long range
[3:18:54] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @patstaresat you got to be at long range where it'll lock on
[3:18:57] <JdotSweapA> chris pratt has 1 character
[3:18:57] <culturesh0ck> yeah the tracking on the carbine feels kinda weird
[3:18:57] <+cubbywolf> run!
[3:18:59] <+D00msDayDan> i miss the plasma rifle so much
[3:18:59] <Dio_TR> @patstaresat you are the biggest halo fan you should know Kappa
[3:19:00] <mikeriffic> no its greaT
[3:19:02] <+monfo_the_great> Covie weapons burn shield human weapon for health, typically
[3:19:04] <+cubbywolf> its mario?
[3:19:05] <+paladinstarbuster> mid range gun
[3:19:05] <mikeriffic> but it sucks at close range
[3:19:05] <+JudgementKaz_> It's not Roger Craig Smith
[3:19:06] <%orochiblood> Pat stop dropping the ball Kappa
[3:19:07] <%Caped_Eggy> You gotta hit them
[3:19:07] <kinkade_77> use your stasis grenade
[3:19:10] <mikeriffic> only use it at mid to far
[3:19:11] <%AHomeschoolDropout> ye
[3:19:11] <RickyRelucent> its a emp gun
[3:19:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> emp gun
[3:19:14] <%ThirdWelles> Just got here. How much battlepass did you buy?
[3:19:16] <+cubbywolf> its a me chris prat?
[3:19:16] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt plasma/shock weapons are good for breaking shields not for actual bodies
[3:19:22] <%AHomeschoolDropout> it's a AOE DOT
[3:19:26] <+cubbywolf> F
[3:19:26] <mikeriffic> its a 4 burst like the BR but it peels sheilds in two
[3:19:27] <+RyanTheRecluse> plasma/energy does big shield damage, then swap to a ballistic weapon or melee for the kill
[3:19:28] <Gray_LoFi> Wait the disruptor's a DoT? That's good to know
[3:19:29] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@WanderingYoren) (warning)
[3:19:29] <+D00msDayDan> it does damage over time but i can't tell how you get it to actually dot, i don't think it's every shot
[3:19:34] <%hereiam407> Emp gun, didn't know Halo had one. Good idea
[3:19:35] <BrandNewNikes> ENEMY HAS THE BALL SMOrc
[3:19:35] <+cubbywolf> hit them
[3:19:37] <%psidefx> an emp
[3:19:42] <+cubbywolf> it seems pretty shit tbh
[3:19:43] <%hereiam407> Removes shields quickly with EMP?
[3:19:44] <WanderingYoren> ??
[3:19:50] <RickyRelucent> it has two now
[3:19:51] <RickyRelucent> shrug
[3:19:54] <kinkade_77> cool armor pat
[3:20:00] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt use plasma/electric gun then swap to ballistic bc plasma/elec breaks shields and ballistic shreds flesh
[3:20:05] <+cubbywolf> idk, the pistol seems pretty strong
[3:20:11] <%RealThiele> LUL those legs
[3:20:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> WE have the ball?

[3:20:21] <@Spydurman> dat body hangin
[3:20:21] <+VestigeOuroboros> @PatStaresAt You should turn your "Look Acceleration" up, it affects how fast you can spin your body if you're being shot in the ass.
[3:20:21] <FaxineiroDePosto> they really dropped the ball on that one
[3:20:22] <%twistedj3ster> dude was hanging from the ceiling
[3:20:24] <tubit> BALL?
[3:20:25] <+cubbywolf> team is getting rekt
[3:20:25] <%G_Thunders> Even the serious AI robot announcer man sounds a lot less angry than he used to
[3:20:27] <+Catpurnicus> Metal Gear?
[3:20:30] <RickyRelucent> B O R K
[3:20:30] <LoreKeeper_Thal> i think he wants the ball

[3:20:40] <FaxineiroDePosto> the dog wants the ball
[3:20:41] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:20:42] <DensityD> do aim
[3:20:43] <wqorst> lady ai was better
[3:20:46] <infernalram> hipfire with battle rifle
[3:20:46] <culturesh0ck> gief
[3:20:46] <%afronooch> I always hardscope
[3:20:47] <WanderingYoren> oh weird @officioprefectuscorgi
[3:20:49] <total_overkill> always aim
[3:20:49] <marvel877> Yes
[3:20:49] <+cubbywolf> that guy was in your blind spot the whole time
[3:20:50] <%AnthroMetal> yes
[3:20:50] <Admiral_PopnFresh> aim
[3:20:51] <%tusk102> depends on distance
[3:20:53] <RickyRelucent> the BRR? aim for longe range
[3:20:55] <+cubbywolf> not a teammate!
[3:20:55] <+YabbaTroll> depends
[3:20:56] <+VestigeOuroboros> bad habit to zoom the BR unless half a map away.
[3:20:57] <%barrakuta371> depends, but usually aim
[3:20:57] <mikeriffic> hip fire is better in most cases
[3:20:58] <marvel877> AIM
[3:20:59] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:21:00] <+NickHatesSnow> depends on how good you are tbh
[3:21:01] <+cubbywolf> THAT BODY!
[3:21:01] <+dolphinbj> rarely aim
[3:21:03] <+cubbywolf> ah he missed it
[3:21:06] <%ThirdWelles> It doesn't affect bloom, so it your preference
[3:21:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> aim but also you gotta hipfire if you're getting shot at
[3:21:08] <@TheYellowcouch> it depends on how good you are
[3:21:09] <+monfo_the_great> Depends, hipfire at assault rifle range
[3:21:09] <graemecrackers2> Geif wants the ball
[3:21:09] <%SWFanatic> listen to zangief, hes trying to tell you bork
[3:21:12] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt getting shot while aiming in knocks you out of your aiming
[3:21:13] <Goldenwolf98> aim most of the time unless like someone is in your face
[3:21:16] <cpt_langosta> but what about this ballyhoo?
[3:21:16] <%G_Thunders> Yeah if there has to be a goofy/upbeat AI the lady VA was doing a better job than Sonic
[3:21:17] <penitentpendant> Elmo is used to his little brother's shenanigans
[3:21:18] <+cubbywolf> nice
[3:21:22] <+cubbywolf> BARK in agreement
[3:21:24] <%athuramn> does aiming reduce spray?
[3:21:25] <+cubbywolf> yers
[3:21:28] <+polothegreatest> br is for 3 or 4 hits?
[3:21:33] <%ThirdWelles> Just straight up, if it feels better zoomed in, zoom in. If not, don't
[3:21:35] <BrandNewNikes> Pog
[3:21:35] <+mitchteck> Depends on range
[3:21:39] <JdotSweapA> mmm yees tell me how amazing i am~
[3:21:39] <+VestigeOuroboros> 4 to the head.
[3:21:41] <$StrawberryPantsu> Is this the return of the Snapshot King?
[3:21:49] <+cubbywolf> i dont think it matters so aim if they are far away?
[3:21:51] <RickyRelucent> I like how hes not spraying the assault full tilt
[3:21:51] <%Cykron> That's NO GOOD!

[3:22:18] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt energy/plasma guns break shields but do very tiny damage to nonshielded enemies. so use them to break shields then switch to ballistics

[3:24:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> cross counter
[3:24:07] <+cubbywolf> incoming ball
[3:24:10] <+VestigeOuroboros> It's centered by default, it can be lowered in the settings.
[3:24:11] <+YabbaTroll> damn that dude flew
[3:24:13] <@Ranryu692> I don't understand why people would want you to spend time replaying games you've already recorded, rather than games you haven't
[3:24:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> punch
[3:24:18] <Cykaima> yeah crosshair is centered i guess now
[3:24:21] <Texascourier> they do @asgard147
[3:24:21] <+cubbywolf> map knowledge
[3:24:25] <+dolphinbj> @TrollKing96 it's been center in Halo for a while now
[3:24:30] <%hereiam407> His SH2 LP is already top notch
[3:24:36] <choocheess> were you still thinking of playing skyrim in the future?
[3:24:37] <+D00msDayDan> i think there's a setting for lowers crosshair?
[3:24:41] <Admiral_PopnFresh> its slightly lower, not as low as normal
[3:24:41] <+cubbywolf> watching max play it was funny
[3:24:49] <+cubbywolf> HAT
[3:24:51] <%A_Zealous_Retort> it's kinda centered if you cut off the healthbar at the top

[3:25:17] <+RelikaNox> Ball is life
[3:25:18] <AngryAsian5> Such poor ball control
[3:25:19] <%hereiam407> Pick up your balls and leave
[3:25:21] <+cubbywolf> the disrespect to your corpse
[3:25:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> BALL dsaSWOONER
[3:25:24] <holyxgrale> You dropped the ball
[3:25:25] <%twistedj3ster> I want Pat as my AI voice
[3:25:25] <%zeroarturia> Yeah the Silent Hill 2 LP was great! let's just leave the game alone.
[3:25:30] <%hereiam407> Sweet ball control is hot
[3:25:32] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @patstaresat Fire the AR in like 5-8 round bursts so you keep it's accuracy
[3:25:34] <+cubbywolf> idk about that
[3:25:37] <+TheFlyingChurro> !BALL AT RISK!
[3:25:39] <choocheess> I am Askana Takashiba! Handler of balls!
[3:25:42] <+VestigeOuroboros> Big team is at least a little less miserable right now in terms of game modes.
[3:25:42] <+YabbaTroll> are there any playlists with vehicles yet?

[3:26:06] <TioXyco> enemy still has the ball
[3:26:08] <cricket42069> "enemy team brutally owning you! : D"
[3:26:12] <TioXyco> DE FEET
[3:26:15] <+cubbywolf> damn
[3:26:15] <TheHeroAppears> DUH FEET
[3:26:15] <BrandNewNikes> DDDDDEFFEAT!
[3:26:16] <+Sirius_6> @YabbaTroll The "Big Team Battle" mode has vehicles
[3:26:16] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt firing the ar in 5-8 round bursts keeps its accuracy up bc the reticle closes so fast
[3:26:17] <cpt_langosta> the FEET
[3:26:18] <+cubbywolf> nice shooting
[3:26:18] <californaya> duh feat
[3:26:19] <jumpyhugs> Duh-feet
[3:26:22] <%RealThiele> enemy balled
[3:26:24] <+polothegreatest> da feet
[3:26:27] <%asgard147> Ya dropped the ball Pat limesNope
[3:26:31] <culturesh0ck> there is at least one 4v4 map with vehicles too
[3:26:33] <RickyRelucent> pat, get paige back here
[3:26:34] <+YabbaTroll> @dolphinbj oh hell yeah, i was gonna ask about btb but i thought there was no way @Sirius_6
[3:26:35] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:26:35] <+carfar_farcar> Do the big team thing
[3:26:36] <RickyRelucent> do big teams
[3:26:39] <@TheYellowcouch> you did your besht
[3:26:39] <RickyRelucent> hop in a warthog
[3:26:42] <RickyRelucent> make her drive
[3:26:43] <LorcaNomad> oh my god that tooltip tho
[3:26:45] <RickyRelucent> or shoot
[3:26:46] <M0untain_wolf> Long to mid ranges Burst
[3:26:46] <AluxDoesNotStream> Faster to kill at medium range.
[3:26:48] <RickyRelucent> either or
[3:26:49] <%tusk102> it means you miss less shots
[3:26:49] <%studleydoorite> depends on range probably
[3:26:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> helps if they're far
[3:26:50] <+cubbywolf> I like how the armour glows where they are hit
[3:26:52] <%ThirdWelles> Close range, no. But you can't hit long range without doing that
[3:26:52] <%hereiam407> I wanna see a Chopper
[3:26:53] <+VestigeOuroboros> @PatStaresAt You might want to turn up your "look acceleration" it affects how fast you can spin your body if you're being shot in the back, and I keep seeing you try but it's too slow.
[3:26:55] <Mirrorcatch> just better for mid range
[3:26:56] <%Glass_Muffin> Heyo @PatStaresAt
[3:26:56] <%A_Zealous_Retort> if you hold it down AR DEFINITELY starts to bloom bad at the end of your mag
[3:26:57] <M0untain_wolf> Close range just go Burrr
[3:26:57] <%athuramn> from far away, yes
[3:27:05] <akitanito> considering pat normally engages at nose range, does it matteR?
[3:27:09] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt at mid range it is
[3:27:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> if the man is smaller than the circle, burst fire
[3:27:14] <TrollKing96> Pat you need to teabag someone before the stream is over.
[3:27:16] <+cubbywolf> you tried your bestest
[3:27:18] <BrandNewNikes> @PatStaresAt how would you actually rate the Halo Infinite game so far? 1/10?
[3:27:25] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt mid range is better burst but up close who gives a fuck
[3:27:28] <%G_Thunders> So theres no real difference between winning or losing as far as progression is concerned?
[3:27:35] <M0untain_wolf> Tbag for Poggers
[3:27:36] <+Cobaltor_252> yeah why have you been not been doing that @PatStaresAt
[3:27:39] <+cubbywolf> switching to your secondary is faster than reloading
[3:27:44] <RushUnplugged> Pat doesn't have a little hat yet, 0/10
[3:27:44] <%AHomeschoolDropout> haha imagine a game where the devs delete the first half of the game so new players don't know what to do, wouldn't that be stupid?
[3:27:46] <+cubbywolf> LUL it depends
[3:27:47] <%Cykron> discipline the child
[3:27:47] <+ahmz1404> it's weird how you always have 1200-1300 viewers, surely it can't be the same people every time
[3:27:47] <%ThirdWelles> Did you drop cash on levels of the battlepass or have you just been grinding out hard?
[3:27:49] <%barrakuta371> Pat needs to start being toxic to realize the full Halo experience
[3:27:49] <%tusk102> @G_Thunders some challenges require wins
[3:27:56] <dan_g_v> bworf?
[3:27:56] <%AHomeschoolDropout> is there another piece of food under the couch
[3:27:58] <+cubbywolf> some of those guys you might have had if you let off the trigger and fired again
[3:28:00] <+cubbywolf> but who knows
[3:28:03] <%SWFanatic> gief bark at food
[3:28:04] <%sleepystardewfarmer> kibble

[3:28:22] <%G_Thunders> @tusk102 ah okay
[3:28:24] <%A_Zealous_Retort> @G_Thunders right now progression is entirely the challenges and while some are "win matches" most arent, they are looking at adding more progression systems in
[3:28:25] <DensityD> Did Someone Say Big Pile of Balogna?!?
[3:28:25] <%Logoth_> Is it Baloney or Bologna
[3:28:26] <jumpyhugs> @ahmz1404 hello, I am baloney

[3:28:33] <%athuramn> I am a bot you are on mobile
[3:28:37] <+ahmz1404> I wasn't suggesting bots lol it's just cool how it's so consistent
[3:28:40] <+Sirius_6> This is actually my first stream in maybe three months
[3:28:44] <clippton> I haven’t played halo multiplayer before but this is pretty fun. Just annoying dealing with pc performance stuff.
[3:28:45] <+cubbywolf> he wants to crawl and get the dust bunnies
[3:28:45] <%studleydoorite> the only me is me, are you sure the only you is you?
[3:28:46] <+Pinkiefan> Click all the images of skeletons to prove you are human.
[3:28:48] <+inktoxicant> even pat's guy is like "fuck yeah slayer"
[3:28:48] <%SWFanatic> Gief vs. Food: "This is a battle I must win."
[3:28:52] <%ThirdWelles> Use the power of kill, pat
[3:28:53] <DensityD> rush b
[3:28:53] <+cubbywolf> B O R K
[3:28:56] <%bluetocho13> Pat i cant believe you buy bologna for views

[3:29:05] <+cubbywolf> rotating round of cucks
[3:29:11] <AluxDoesNotStream> yo your team-mates are great this match
[3:29:12] <choocheess> damn so close
[3:29:16] <DensityD> you got 2
[3:29:16] <graemecrackers2> How many mustard bottles dose Paige go through a month?
[3:29:18] <clippton> Damn
[3:29:19] <M0untain_wolf> shield where down
[3:29:20] <+cubbywolf> you pay money to have bots so you make money to pay the bots
[3:29:21] <+monfo_the_great> I wonder if they'll keep this or if it's just for launch to get all the newbies to try the different modes
[3:29:22] <+polothegreatest> no objectives, only kill
[3:29:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat you're haloing
[3:29:36] <marvel877> Is this a city or a facility built to look like a city?
[3:29:38] <%octavian_wolf> air dodge
[3:29:39] <RickyRelucent> omg he IS haloing
[3:29:43] <+cubbywolf> slay or be slayed
[3:29:45] <AluxDoesNotStream> mid-air dodging
[3:29:45] <DensityD> more nades
[3:29:47] <+cubbywolf> DED
[3:29:48] <+Cobaltor_252> its a dodge?
[3:29:48] <%ThirdWelles> It'd be useful if you had a Hammer or a Sword
[3:29:49] <primaryfire> Air dash
[3:29:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> dodge behind someone and one hit them
[3:29:54] <+cubbywolf> nice
[3:29:57] <culturesh0ck> quick escapes and ninja-ing (dodge behind enemy)
[3:29:57] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you can boost in any direction and in mid air
[3:29:58] <%AHomeschoolDropout> it pairs well with the melee weapons
[3:29:59] <choocheess> i think it gives you the same thing the elites had when they'd dodge shit
[3:30:02] <+Brannax> Thruster used to be an innate ability in Halo 5, they just kept it and made it a pickup instead
[3:30:07] <clippton> Is this gonna support 120fps?
[3:30:08] <+cubbywolf> almost
[3:30:15] <M0untain_wolf> side step can disorient the attacker to
[3:30:17] <choocheess> nice
[3:30:19] <+cubbywolf> wait is it locked at 60?
[3:30:21] <AluxDoesNotStream> Ideally in Halo you use jumping a bunch to evade gunfire and platform.
[3:30:22] <DensityD> he was typing
[3:30:23] <choocheess> afk
[3:30:23] <M0untain_wolf> AFK
[3:30:26] <cpt_langosta> he was dying
[3:30:27] <+ahmz1404> don't bring a sword to a gun fight
[3:30:36] <%Logoth_> I have mine locked at 144 and its great
[3:30:37] <choocheess> googling how to halo
[3:30:37] <%tusk102> hes also at 4k i think
[3:30:38] <+cubbywolf> its to dodge
[3:30:44] <DensityD> jumpu
[3:30:46] <MiamiMemory> Does this game use a Sonic the Hedgehog voiceover pack?
[3:30:48] <+cubbywolf> or boost around corners like CoD maytbe?
[3:30:48] <choocheess> nice
[3:30:49] <%Logoth_> I cant take a rocket launcher called spanker seriously

[3:31:30] <DensityD> don't use frags as straight lines, they bounce good
[3:31:30] <jumpyhugs> didn't get to blow your spunker load
[3:31:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh yeah you can mark targets too

[3:35:24] <zerointelligence000> is this game good on wifi?
[3:35:24] <choocheess> shit yeah
[3:35:25] <+cubbywolf> ye
[3:35:29] <%hereiam407> For sure, I'm surprised it is running this well
[3:35:30] <+cubbywolf> someone is murdering you right now
[3:35:40] <Gray_LoFi> Yeah the impromptu release and fixed playlists definitely smells like "stress test"
[3:35:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> There's like 1mil+ people playing
[3:35:44] <TheLegendofNate> the free multiplayer is poggers
[3:35:47] <+cubbywolf> runs better than BF2042
[3:35:48] <funkerbuster> cant even enter multiplayer at one point
[3:35:50] <%Tyrimat> It is doing JUST fine on my SHIT internet
[3:35:53] <Cykaima> halo has kinda always worked on wifi
[3:35:55] <%hereiam407> They got super prepared for this
[3:36:02] <+VestigeOuroboros> 40ms ping on tether so I'd say it's decent.
[3:36:08] <cs0402196> I got '40' mbps but regularly get 100+ mbps wifi
[3:36:08] <+ahmz1404> I'm guessing they are teleporting around for other players tho lol
[3:36:09] <culturesh0ck> sorry if asked but any plans to do BTB tonight?
[3:36:10] <+polothegreatest> noooo, dont do that
[3:36:14] <%Tyrimat> Only had one game so far with noticeable lag
[3:36:18] <%hereiam407> After all this time, they couldn't possibly screw up the multiplayer release
[3:36:21] <+cubbywolf> sexbox
[3:36:24] <clippton> I’m on wifi and it’s perfectly fine.
[3:36:26] <%hereiam407> Just the multiplayer
[3:36:36] <+Sirius_6> I get 12ms when I connect to an Oceanic server, but 80% of the time I get thrown into a 230ms NA laghole
[3:36:37] <+cubbywolf> wifi poors
[3:36:44] <%ThirdWelles> Man just cracked his mechanical knuckles
[3:36:44] <+polothegreatest> xbox dongle for xcloud when?
[3:36:48] <choocheess> if it's a very american online shooter game, im sure it'll accommodate mediocre internet
[3:36:54] <%Schlager087> Is that USA or French?

[3:36:59] <funkerbuster> all i got is slayer in the past 2 hours
[3:37:03] <%Cykron> God the Spartans look so good in this, so much better than in 4 and 5
[3:37:06] <AluxDoesNotStream> It's a team game and sometimes the team doesn't want to play the objective.
[3:37:19] <RickyRelucent> trick is not to overstretch
[3:37:21] <+MillionStabz> Wow I thought that was a bot

[3:37:32] <%DianaTheAscian> was prob looking at their phone
[3:37:33] <RickyRelucent> keeping two bases is better then tryying to get 33 and having both of em be contested

[3:40:28] <+VestigeOuroboros> @PatStaresAt any plans to queue big team tonight or nah
[3:40:29] <$Solid_Stro> If you’re making other people rage quit, you’re doing alright.
[3:40:29] <+cubbywolf> you jsut crouch over their particles
[3:40:31] <choocheess> not saying you're relying on it, but is there any tracking?
[3:40:32] <%SWFanatic> Wow Pat is doing really well vs Bots
[3:40:39] <culturesh0ck> no grifball yet

[3:41:02] <+MTLxSpider> make sense
[3:41:05] <culturesh0ck> yeah makes sense
[3:41:06] <+cubbywolf> i came here for pro gameplay and pro gameplay only
[3:41:07] <+Cobaltor_252> yeah big team battle is a pain if you're team isn't working together
[3:41:08] <%superc37> any plans on playing with viewers?
[3:41:09] <RickyRelucent> new game
[3:41:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah that's the experience LUL
[3:41:16] <RickyRelucent> let urself breathe lol
[3:41:16] <%Cykron> so your bad
[3:41:19] <%tusk102> custom game vs us pat
[3:41:20] <%maskofmichael> Is it weird that I just like to play offline, just me vs a full team bots?
[3:41:22] <+cubbywolf> only when they automatch to his level
[3:41:24] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:41:26] <cricket42069> ball! : D
[3:41:27] <%asgard147> BALL?! WHERE?! psaDogchamp
[3:41:28] <%studleydoorite> he says ball incoming so sensually
[3:41:28] <clippton> Collecting the cores can be really annoying
[3:41:29] <funkerbuster> i cant remember the pickup locations anyway LUL
[3:41:29] <primaryfire> this is by far my least favourite mode
[3:41:30] <%tusk102> ball
[3:41:31] <choocheess> sounds like something you've gotta be team mic'd for
[3:41:43] <+VestigeOuroboros> If you queued with your audience I imagine you'd crush it though. Halo is truly a social experience.
[3:41:44] <+Flamefish345> Just got in, is the progression just as bad as they say???
[3:41:48] <M0untain_wolf> Bork bork
[3:41:49] <+VestigeOuroboros> To each their own though
[3:41:49] <culturesh0ck> not only am i surprised the sentinel beam is back, but its also not awful

[3:42:20] <funkerbuster> @flamefish345 cant pick specific modes
[3:42:21] <%asgard147> Why people all droppin' the ball today? limesFeels
[3:42:24] <%tusk102> the reloading "complete matches" xp mission is nice
[3:42:29] <trbrovah> it's like they looked at halo reach's progression and just said let's do the exact opposite of that
[3:42:36] <RickyRelucent> bnhj.
[3:42:36] <+Moaradin> luckily the game itself is great and the progression should be pretty easy to fix in comparison
[3:42:36] <+Flamefish345> hmmm, maybe I should wait until they fix it, if 343 ever does
[3:42:37] <cricket42069> ball is hold..
[3:42:38] <%AncelDeLambert> this game does not have engies and is therefore inferior
[3:42:43] <%tusk102> at least the gameplay is great
[3:42:44] <+cubbywolf> we have the ball
[3:42:45] <%AncelDeLambert> where's my turret farm, motherfucker?

[3:42:59] <M0untain_wolf> ded
[3:43:00] <funkerbuster> my ball WutFace
[3:43:00] <+cubbywolf> you can help your team by absorbing their bullets
[3:43:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat is the ball commander
[3:43:03] <primaryfire> this ai sounds like kyle mccarley
[3:43:05] <culturesh0ck> they had a perfectly decent system with MCC but whatever i guess
[3:43:05] <choocheess> stick around
[3:43:05] <%SovPho> @Flamefish345 progression is going to be permanently broken as long as some very, very basic cosmetics are paywalled
[3:43:07] <bigdumbstreams> the fact chris redfield is a main voice is weird lol

[3:43:27] <M0untain_wolf> noce one pat
[3:43:27] <%SovPho> i.e. having your spartan be colored white costs like 20 bucks right now?
[3:43:27] <+Moaradin> perfect
[3:43:28] <RickyRelucent> congratulations
[3:43:28] <@QueequegTheater> Spank them for Sonic
[3:43:29] <%studleydoorite> "oooh there's a spankin' comin' in hot" - sonic
[3:43:30] <MiamiMemory> @trbrovah  Reach had a credit system for progression didn't it? I assume this doesn't have that?
[3:43:30] <%tusk102> @Flamefish345 its really not the worst. theres a respawning "daily" mission that never actually runs out that is just "play matches" that gives you 150 xp for completing. so basically you get 150 xp every 3-5 matches
[3:43:32] <$Solid_Stro> c4sageLUL
[3:43:32] <RickyRelucent> you played yourself

[3:44:23] <mikeriffic> Ive been doing ranked,7 games in a row wer eoddball, so done with it myself
[3:44:28] <%tusk102> @RickyRelucent >Heavily armored healer? thats a a paladin
[3:44:32] <+Flamefish345> @IncredibleMeh har har har
[3:44:36] <marvel877> Is quickplay really only random?
[3:44:37] <+bigslinglelino> I really hope they allow you to choose gamemodes and add more playlists on the full release
[3:44:38] <mikeriffic> yea its only good at mid to long
[3:44:39] <choocheess> damn that gun got nerfed
[3:44:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah they can sidestep it real easy when you're close
[3:44:43] <%A_Zealous_Retort> I have a challenge to play 1 round of oddball and I CANT FIND ODDBALL MATCHES
[3:44:43] <cricket42069> how could you get tired of a gamemode that forces you to hear the word "ball" 17 times per second
[3:44:43] <mikeriffic> its great but trash at close
[3:44:45] <BlueSpartan119> oddball was better  when the skull one-shot
[3:44:46] <M0untain_wolf> overr!
[3:44:49] <funkerbuster> non hitscans are hard
[3:44:50] <%ThirdWelles> @marvel877 Yeah that's all that's in the game rn
[3:44:51] <+VestigeOuroboros> Oddball is really only fun if you're playing with two full teams in a comp setting. Kinda a mistake to force so many people to play it.
[3:44:51] <Buttku> Nu u
[3:44:54] <+UltraViolet371> has halo always had a goofy AI ghost peanut gallery?
[3:44:58] <+ahmz1404> is the MP going to be free on release too
[3:44:59] <choocheess> i miss the old plasma rifle
[3:45:03] <AluxDoesNotStream> I hate u sonic
[3:45:03] <+pieking83> i feel like the game just uses aim assist to make up for bad aiming
[3:45:09] <RickyRelucent> @tusk102 stretched it a bit but kek'd nonetheless woolieYE
[3:45:11] <cpt_langosta> PIZZA

[3:45:43] <$Solid_Stro> Please tell me it’s possible to mute that voice in settings?
[3:45:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> this is a lightning sniper that EMPs vehicles
[3:45:48] <thesoldierofjoy> Its good for changing direction midair more than anything so you dont eat a rocket
[3:45:51] <+MillionStabz> Are you better than the IGN player?
[3:45:56] <+Moaradin> you can turn off ai
[3:46:00] <%SWFanatic> free kill

[3:46:12] <scrambledxeggz> I literally cant hear anything but Sonic now that pat said that
[3:46:14] <%SveriSageAdvice> i confirmed it, it is Prompto, Robbie Daymond
[3:46:14] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt noctis va is a spartan and prompto is the ai
[3:46:17] <r0termond> gettin rusty
[3:46:25] <M0untain_wolf> pat at that rang just go buuurrrr
[3:46:34] <+ahmz1404> a babe with a blade
[3:46:39] <%studleydoorite> someone said earlier the AR doesn't get headshots so aim center mass @PatStaresAt
[3:46:41] <funkerbuster> Goro Akechi?
[3:46:42] <cpt_langosta> sonic would NEVER say the word "ball"
[3:46:44] <+shnoogertime> sonic the fudgehog
[3:46:53] <MiamiMemory> Spanker inbound
[3:46:54] <+FadingEmber> Is the mp 3 good or Reach good?
[3:46:58] <%ThirdWelles> @studleydoorite That sounds like a lie that person said
[3:47:00] <choocheess> @choocheess so rental cloud?
[3:47:01] <marvel877> Pat, whenn are you going to teabag somebody?
[3:47:12] <+VestigeOuroboros> the sentinel beam making dubstep sounds is weird
[3:47:24] <%A_Zealous_Retort> EVERYTHING headshots against unarmored now
[3:47:27] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the ai is prompto and one of the spartan voices is noctis
[3:47:28] <+D00msDayDan> all weapons can do headshot damage as of halo 5, but only precision weapons will instant kill on headshot
[3:47:32] <+bigslinglelino> new shotgun is ass
[3:47:32] <%SWFanatic> double KO
[3:47:36] <ItsEzKill> ranked?
[3:47:36] <%studleydoorite> is that an achievement?
[3:47:37] <+MillionStabz> The shotgun is actual trash, don't use it
[3:47:38] <cpt_langosta> lol that grenade was goin nuts
[3:47:42] <TheHeroAppears> yes
[3:47:45] <culturesh0ck> how does everyone feel about bulldog
[3:47:48] <culturesh0ck> oh
[3:47:49] <funkerbuster> reloading feels like a death sentence
[3:47:51] <choocheess> Pat's not the toxic player he thinks he is
[3:47:52] <marvel877> hell yeah
[3:47:53] <%dekkitout> Forgetting is not very gamer of you
[3:47:55] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> YEAHYEAH

[3:47:58] <wqorst> elderly teabag lmao
[3:47:58] <%SaiyanShoto> Can you choose which games you get put in? Getting tired of capture the point on the big maps
[3:47:58] <%tusk102> he did it
[3:47:59] <%echobee_tv> wow
[3:47:59] <WanderingYoren> yeah it's weird every gun that doesn't one shot headshot unshielded enemies gets a DMG multiplier for heads, even the plasma pistol
[3:48:00] <choocheess> lol
[3:48:00] <+VestigeOuroboros> this is the way

[3:48:11] <$Solid_Stro> True gamer
[3:48:11] <cpt_langosta> kicked for bm incoming...
[3:48:12] <marvel877> PAT IS THE HALOMAN
[3:48:13] <+bigslinglelino> The bulldog and the heatwave are the worst weapons in the game
[3:48:16] <choocheess> this gun looks cool
[3:48:17] <+D00msDayDan> teabagging is harder when it's toggle crouch
[3:48:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> ball dropped
[3:48:23] <RickyRelucent> SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[3:48:25] <+samuraiskitz> Pats making mlg montages i see LUL

[3:48:29] <choocheess> get the spanker1
[3:48:30] <@QueequegTheater> Man he even talks like Prompto
[3:48:31] <%SWFanatic> ptfo
[3:48:31] <%Goatbait> reported for toxic behavior psaWhat
[3:48:41] <%SaiyanShoto> I hope he comes back and teabags you LUL
[3:48:55] <%tusk102> heatwave is good when you switch it to the vertical shot version
[3:48:55] <choocheess> nice
[3:48:57] <+RedQueensAce> its full auto btw
[3:49:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> Bulldog has pretty long range for a Halo shotty tho
[3:49:03] <RickyRelucent> PFFRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTT
[3:49:03] <cybz99> yeah the shotgun takes like 3 shots its ridiculous
[3:49:04] <+Moaradin> heatwave is pretty awesome at times
[3:49:07] <+VestigeOuroboros> lol
[3:49:07] <MiamiMemory> HE DID IT
[3:49:09] <jumpyhugs> LUL
[3:49:11] <choocheess> lol dont get shot in the back tbagging

[3:49:15] <jumpyhugs> i clapped
[3:49:18] <choocheess> lol
[3:49:21] <Cykaima> GAMER
[3:49:25] <%SaiyanShoto> I wish my aim was more consistent, one minute I have aimbot aim then the next I am shooting all over the place LUL
[3:49:28] <+ahmz1404> toxiccc
[3:49:28] <choocheess> up
[3:49:30] <culturesh0ck> NO BULLY
[3:49:30] <+BlueLunecy> I miss assassinations
[3:49:32] <%ThirdWelles> Pat did you see the shit that came out about Kotick today?
[3:49:33] <@QueequegTheater> Because Halo MP is defined by long TTK, so they don't want a weapon that can 1-shot.  Honestly they should let it 1-shot but only in melee range
[3:49:37] <mrethanclifford> So, does Pat approve of this game? 🤔
[3:49:39] <BlueSpartan119> @cybz99 2 shot, but you can't spam it
[3:49:45] <BigColossus> balls {deep}
[3:49:56] <%Logoth_> Its not fun turning a corner and instantly dying
[3:49:57] <%DianaTheAscian> Pat is returning to his 2000s form
[3:50:02] <roz_en> standard weapons are underpowered in general in comparison to older games
[3:50:02] <%ThirdWelles> Or the response the Activision Board of Directors gave ?
[3:50:06] <+bigslinglelino> its a sniper
[3:50:06] <%tusk102> @ThirdWelles i think he mentioned it at the beginning
[3:50:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> That's a sniper
[3:50:10] <funkerbuster> a shotty?
[3:50:13] <choocheess> damn that gun is needy
[3:50:13] <%SWFanatic> doors and corners
[3:50:14] <%SovPho> dude the challenges are some horrible english, i know this is a stupid complaint but come on just... some effort?
[3:50:14] <+D00msDayDan> pat that was a sniper rifle not a shotgun
[3:50:16] <marvel877> Its a sniper, right?
[3:50:19] <%A_Zealous_Retort> ... thats not a shotgun its a sniper
[3:50:21] <RickyRelucent> No other reason
[3:50:22] <%SovPho> have some*
[3:50:26] <RickyRelucent> corners suck and so do shooters
[3:50:26] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Halo has always had long TTK
[3:50:30] <%ThirdWelles> the Heatwave?
[3:50:31] <RickyRelucent> i enjoy point and click games
[3:50:39] <RickyRelucent> >< LUL LUL payoB payoB
[3:50:39] <%ThirdWelles> Heatwave is just objectively bad
[3:50:40] <culturesh0ck> @roz_en except the AR it feels like
[3:50:45] <choocheess> looks like a sniper off the hip like rail gun depending on hits needed
[3:50:48] <+MTLxSpider> Thats why i use the radar and always check my 6 LUL @Logoth_
[3:50:49] <BlueSpartan119> old shotgun could one-shot
[3:50:51] <%SovPho> @RickyRelucent point and click their heads
[3:50:55] <Mushinronja> it's only fun to die in 1v1 honor duels, clearly
[3:50:56] <@QueequegTheater> Corner shotty isn't outplaying them, it's CoD twitchy shooting
[3:50:57] <choocheess> nice
[3:50:59] <WanderingYoren> it promotes passive and defensive play
[3:51:00] <BlueSpartan119> was pump action tho
[3:51:01] <cpt_langosta> are you aware that love is like a heatwave?
[3:51:12] <choocheess> good job
[3:51:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> @BlueSpartan119 Less range too
[3:51:18] <%IncredibleMeh> guys why not just shotgun and then punch man in face?
[3:51:20] <$ItsRatman> Pats wrecking these kids
[3:51:23] <choocheess> practice?
[3:51:26] <+Avossk_> sick aim lol
[3:51:27] <%hereiam407> I found love in a hopeless place
[3:51:28] <%tusk102> wait the shotguns full auto?
[3:51:34] <%ThirdWelles> The AR feels like it has a shit-ton of muzzle climb on PC. I can't get used to using it well
[3:51:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> sniping in Halo is hard
[3:51:38] <+D00msDayDan> the shock rifle shoots a burst so you gotta keep it on target
[3:51:39] <+ahmz1404> where is this ball
[3:51:40] <RickyRelucent> u seem to be rather good with the AR
[3:51:44] <%Logoth_> Apparently the precision weapons dont have a lot of aim assist
[3:51:47] <primaryfire> with such a high time to kill overall, one shot kill weapons either need to be hard to use or not be there
[3:51:51] <%hereiam407> Da ball
[3:51:53] <WanderingYoren> you absolutely can bulldog than melee, it's pretty good coupled with the high fire rate
[3:51:54] <+MoFroGT> Anybody know if Pat is playing on Xbox or PC?
[3:51:55] <Play_UN_Squadron> LUL
[3:51:56] <%SWFanatic> try aiming
[3:51:58] <%ThirdWelles> Crazy talk did NOT activate
[3:52:00] <+VestigeOuroboros> the reason it misses is that the deadzones are really high by default and makes it feel like it's always just short.
[3:52:00] <+ahmz1404> where is da ball
[3:52:00] <choocheess> you'll get there pat
[3:52:01] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt electricity for shields
[3:52:04] <marvel877> PC
[3:52:07] <@QueequegTheater> @MoFroGT PS5
[3:52:08] <%tusk102> @MoFroGT pc
[3:52:09] <Ranger747> was that mr halo
[3:52:10] <%hereiam407> Pretty sure its PC
[3:52:10] <culturesh0ck> PC
[3:52:10] <%ThirdWelles> *Then Perish*
[3:52:12] <cpt_langosta> pat, use the secondary attack on a cold weapon for a HEAVY DAMAGE
[3:52:12] <+Moaradin> just click their head
[3:52:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> point gun at heads
[3:52:15] <%studleydoorite> you don't want to aim too much
[3:52:20] <choocheess> that looks cool did it overheat
[3:52:22] <anAngryHamster> If the shotgun doesn't one shot it should slow the enemy for a moment when you hit them at close range. Makes f the followup melee easier
[3:52:23] <RickyRelucent> this is the combo
[3:52:27] <WanderingYoren> pat use fireball
[3:52:27] <RickyRelucent> this will work
[3:52:28] <striderzer0> that gun has travel right? like you have to lead it?
[3:52:29] <roz_en> @culturesh0ck yeah, and the sniper functions like it always
[3:52:32] <+bigslinglelino> old halo shotgun was well balance because to one-hit-kill you had to get absurdly close
[3:52:35] <%hereiam407> We should get a game where John Halo's long lost brother comes back
[3:52:36] <jumpyhugs> @ThirdWelles LUL
[3:52:36] <@QueequegTheater> This feels like a Destiny gun
[3:52:36] <%ChocolateMoofin> ChocolateMoofin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Just wanted to say thanks for being you, man. You play/do everything so thoroughly, especially Mass Effect. I can always count on a fun time with your youtube vods! Stay cool!
[3:52:37] <%A_Zealous_Retort> if you shoot until you break their shields with the disruptor they will ALMOST always die from the DoT
[3:52:48] <choocheess> you're doing it PAt
[3:52:48] <%SWFanatic> nice
[3:52:50] <+VestigeOuroboros> pat learning the way of the noob combo
[3:52:52] <%SWFanatic> gonna be a close one
[3:52:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> are assassinations in this?
[3:52:58] <@QueequegTheater> Wait, is there no assassination?
[3:53:03] <+foomaster22> F
[3:53:03] <%ThirdWelles> @PatStaresAt The dash looks like it's a lot better when you use it in the air. That guy you killed went pretty far
[3:53:11] <%SWFanatic> close one
[3:53:12] <choocheess> damn it was so close
[3:53:15] <roz_en> but aside from that, I struggle to kill in this game
[3:53:16] <primaryfire> aiming for the head when their shields aren't down is actually detrimental because you're more likely to miss from spread, increasing ttk
[3:53:17] <%ThirdWelles> @QueequegTheater No assassinations, but attacks from behind instakill
[3:53:17] <+VestigeOuroboros> no reach style assassination, just beatdowns.
[3:53:17] <marvel877> F
[3:53:18] <+ahmz1404> where was da ball
[3:53:19] <%asgard147> DA FEET
[3:53:20] <%studleydoorite> duh feet jermaOld
[3:53:21] <%A_Zealous_Retort> da feet
[3:53:27] <cpt_langosta> a truly cigar-less victory
[3:53:27] <RickyRelucent> No assassinations in the BETA
[3:53:29] <%ThirdWelles> *Melees from behind
[3:53:30] <%strakillias> The t-bag karma caught up
[3:53:32] <ZBWMusic> Gotta aim for the cheeks
[3:53:32] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the ai is prompto and noctis plays a spartan
[3:53:33] <RickyRelucent> supposedly on release
[3:53:35] <RickyRelucent> sorry guys
[3:53:42] <%ChocolateMoofin> from what i've heard, they may add assassinations later
[3:53:44] <+lunar_decay> is this the fun?
[3:53:44] <Goldenwolf98> no assassinations yet I believe they said somewhere they want to add them
[3:53:49] <BlueSpartan119> @QueequegTheater no, but they plan to add them back
[3:53:54] <BigColossus> t-bagging did not help at all
[3:53:55] <+VestigeOuroboros> LOL
[3:53:57] <RickyRelucent> Theyy will add assassinations later
[3:54:00] <%ThirdWelles> Wow this Battlepass system is horseshit
[3:54:01] <r0termond> The only thing i dont like is the loading screen lmao
[3:54:02] <RickyRelucent> they will be customizable
[3:54:03] <%hereiam407> He take da poo poo
[3:54:05] <RickyRelucent> like in 5
[3:54:15] <BlueSpartan119> @RickyRelucent they won't be at launch either iirc
[3:54:19] <%hereiam407> @ThirdWelles Haven't paid attention, is it a big issue?
[3:54:26] <RickyRelucent> atleast the battlepass is free kek
[3:54:28] <%edibleskeleton> wow this free game having an optional battle pass sucks
[3:54:36] <RickyRelucent> @BlueSpartan119 y i k e s
[3:54:45] <+Cobaltor_252> @hereiam407 progression happens at a snails pace, you can only get xp from challenges
[3:54:48] <RickyRelucent> its not optional
[3:54:51] <RickyRelucent> LUL
[3:55:01] <BlueSpartan119> @RickyRelucent there are 66 free items on the pass, 40 are challenge swaps
[3:55:02] <%ThirdWelles> @hereiam407 You can only level it up if you finish the challenges it gives you
[3:55:03] <%edibleskeleton> you don't have to buy it
[3:55:13] <%hereiam407> @Cobaltor_252 Does it give you a sense of achievement?
[3:55:18] <%strakillias> Assassinations are too big of an potential battlepass seller to not put in at some point. Probably gonna try to sell the next BP off of it
[3:55:19] <%ThirdWelles> OH THANK DIDN'T REALIZE
[3:55:27] <%SaiyanShoto> At least they’re starting to fix the battle pass
[3:55:28] <BlueSpartan119> @RickyRelucent also only 2 free helms at levels 81 & 96!
[3:55:50] <+polothegreatest> next BP is in may
[3:55:53] <RickyRelucent> Nodders
[3:56:07] <+Cobaltor_252> @hereiam407 no but it gives me a sense of pride and accomplishment KappaHD
[3:56:17] <monki_the_goblin> I hope they fix the progression system and add ways to earn credits without buying them
[3:56:22] <%ThirdWelles> "If you don't like it don't participate" is an argument made by clowns. Because I WANT to like it so that I can participate
[3:56:25] <%athuramn> at least we can all play this game and look identical, that's a relief
[3:56:30] <+VestigeOuroboros> I think the biggest tragedy of the battle pass, is that the MK VI helmet is in it and therefore makes it a mandatory purchase.
[3:56:48] <RickyRelucent> @monki u mean like a lvling, credit earning syystem where you can buy every option u unlock?
[3:56:51] <BlueSpartan119> progression is SUPER FUCKED, but the gameplay is good and they have a solid base to improve on
[3:56:55] <%JoshManVGH> Call of Duty Vanguard Multiplayer is free this weekend apparently Kappa
[3:56:55] <RickyRelucent> completely unheard of
[3:57:00] <%tusk102> @VestigeOuroboros and emiles helmet
[3:57:00] <RickyRelucent> *looks over to reach*
[3:57:14] <%Goatbait> What's Call of Duty?
[3:57:15] <culturesh0ck> @JoshManVGH wonder why...
[3:57:16] <monki_the_goblin> @ThirdWelles THIS. Criticizing how bad the progression system is doesn't mean we dislike the game. We just want it to be better
[3:57:16] <%ThirdWelles> Reach probably did it best
[3:57:20] <RickyRelucent> unlock every option with credits*
[3:57:38] <%tusk102> the mcc did the buying gear thing good too
[3:57:42] <RickyRelucent> the progression system is forced in
[3:57:50] <ape_hawk> did pat get tea-bagged yet?
[3:57:50] <RickyRelucent> and the battlepass is liek lootboxes
[3:57:56] <RickyRelucent> dont @ me
[3:58:01] <choocheess> it looks fun as hell
[3:58:07] <%JoshManVGH> Halo is a fun game.
[3:58:08] <choocheess> you're doing pretty well too
[3:58:12] <%GIGA255> Pat the American?
[3:58:13] <+Cobaltor_252> @RickyRelucent no @RickyRelucent
[3:58:14] <%tusk102> the battlepass isnt like lootboxes bc you dont get random gear
[3:58:14] <RickyRelucent> yup
[3:58:19] <%ThirdWelles> Toxicity is tradition
[3:58:24] <%ThirdWelles> BM with the boys
[3:58:25] <%Goatbait> Is Pat playing on PC?
[3:58:25] <RickyRelucent> par for the course
[3:58:29] <%GIGA255> or are those french colors
[3:58:31] <RickyRelucent> every game HAS to have it
[3:58:31] <%tusk102> @RickyRelucent Kappa
[3:58:32] <%hereiam407> I like this
[3:58:35] <+wmeldrum> Pat Halo and the peach biter
[3:58:37] <%SaiyanShoto> The battle pass is NOT like a loot box LUL LUL
[3:58:37] <%SinnerEbru> yea why not
[3:58:38] <choocheess> sniping's other kinds of crazy
[3:58:38] <%hereiam407> Its been fun to watch
[3:58:40] <RickyRelucent> @Cobaltor_252 QQ
[3:58:42] <+MillionStabz> Runs a lot better than the previous flights
[3:58:45] <%cade_calrayn> will you be playing with Paige next week or tonight? lol
[3:58:46] <%Tyrimat> Have you hopped into big team?
[3:58:50] <monki_the_goblin> idk how this game can look good even on the base Xbox One.
[3:58:53] <+bigslinglelino> you gonna check out the campaign?
[3:58:56] <ape_hawk> Halo and GTA3 and G4, all back...
[3:58:58] <%tusk102> yeah no the battlepass isnt a lootbox at all bc the gear is gauranteed
[3:58:59] <+OboTolken> It's interesting that this isn't an xbox exclusive
[3:58:59] <%JoshManVGH> Played 2 hours of Outriders while listening. Seems fun, haven't dared try Multiplayer until more feedback online. Thank god theres halo
[3:59:00] <%afronooch> i cant snipe under pressure
[3:59:01] <+wmeldrum> big damage gun
[3:59:01] <%ThirdWelles> Paige playing shooting game?
[3:59:03] <%afronooch> like at all
[3:59:06] <BlueSpartan119> only thing that sucks about pc is they turned off red reticle, cuz cheaters or something
[3:59:06] <%Goatbait> I'm trying to get on, but it keeps crashing on start up
[3:59:08] <RickyRelucent> it is exactly like lootboxes, its lazy game design
[3:59:09] <%tusk102> @monki_the_goblin it looks fine on xbox one im playing it there now
[3:59:19] <monki_the_goblin> yeah, this is the multiplayer beta
[3:59:22] <RickyRelucent> Oooo
[3:59:22] <+VestigeOuroboros> You can improve your sniping against bots with infinite ammo on, and dialing in your aim settings.
[3:59:25] <RickyRelucent> purple looks good
[3:59:27] <choocheess> damn big purp!
[3:59:29] <%JoshManVGH> Shinny dome one?
[3:59:31] <cheap_turbo> that's the best everyone wants
[3:59:37] <%ThirdWelles> How's your pass progress going? Found it annoying or anything?
[3:59:37] <RickyRelucent> think thats a new helmet
[3:59:39] <Kodpol> My nam is Michael  J Caboose, and I hate babbies.
[3:59:39] <RickyRelucent> for this game
[3:59:40] <BlueSpartan119> that's the $20 one isn't it?
[3:59:42] <choocheess> nice
[3:59:42] <subjectg> EVA is a good pick
[3:59:43] <%ThirdWelles> I saw you're at 5
[3:59:45] <RickyRelucent> same for the shoulders/chest
[3:59:49] <choocheess> oh shit
[3:59:53] <+Cobaltor_252> @RickyRelucent I didn't know you knew what you get out of lootboxes before getting them, oh wait
[3:59:53] <+Stormiercashew> circle is best ai waifu
[3:59:53] <%A_Zealous_Retort> purple guy is wearing armor from the store but the EVA helmet is early in the pass
[3:59:56] <RickyRelucent> thats the EVA helmet?
[3:59:57] <choocheess> plasma launcher i think
[4:00:02] <%tusk102> having a progression thing that gives you gear isnt as lazy as "buy this box with real money and hope you get the thing you want fucker"
[4:00:05] <RickyRelucent> jesus that shit has changed from halo 2-3
[4:00:13] <%tusk102> its why i hate gacha
[4:00:15] <penitentpendant> Is it STOMP 'O CLOCK?
[4:00:16] <%JoshManVGH> The scratched up one with the skull later in the battle pass DOES NOT look good.
[4:00:27] <subjectg> yeah i prefer the big ol fish bowl from halo 3
[4:00:28] <Capn_Trips> Is SWAT in?
[4:00:31] <%tusk102> at the very least the battle pass guarantees items
[4:00:34] <%A_Zealous_Retort> @RickyRelucent nah EVA is a different one, that guy was wearing a set from the store that looks kinda like EVA
[4:00:35] <%SinnerEbru> NICE
[4:00:35] <%notsoy> DOUBLE KO
[4:00:37] <%JoshManVGH> Trade is a win!
[4:00:39] <+wmeldrum> that's the Halo punch trade
[4:00:41] <monki_the_goblin> @Capn_Trips not yet
[4:00:47] <%A_Zealous_Retort> @Capn_Trips not yet, soon hopefully
[4:00:47] <%tusk102> @Capn_Trips not yet but it seems they are adding shit on actual launch day
[4:00:49] <%OG_M_Bison> @Capn_Trips No it's just quickplay, big teams, and ranked
[4:00:56] <+Moaradin> i love that melee trades are still the same lol
[4:00:57] <RickyRelucent> @A_Zealous_Retort cheers
[4:01:00] <+VestigeOuroboros> that was cheese
[4:01:02] <Capn_Trips> @monki_the_goblin Bogus, thnks though
[4:01:03] <RickyRelucent> Is it dome shaped?
[4:01:06] <RickyRelucent> like reach?
[4:01:08] <+ahmz1404> is it always 4v4
[4:01:11] <%tusk102> from what i understand, they are adding more shit on actual launch day including weapons and stuff
[4:01:11] <%JoshManVGH> I'm partial of getting spooked around a corner with the rocket launcher
[4:01:11] <Kodpol> bajFlex bajGasm
[4:01:12] <RickyRelucent> that one didnt look too bad
[4:01:14] <BlueSpartan119> crouchwalking  LUL
[4:01:14] <choocheess> did you guys hear they're actually gonna do a halo show?
[4:01:18] <%GIGA255> not a fan of the voices. are those optional?
[4:01:23] <%tusk102> @RickyRelucent the eva helmet+emiles are both in the game
[4:01:25] <%athuramn> it's money shaped, like with credits
[4:01:27] <RickyRelucent> rogue helmet from 4 might be a good replacement
[4:01:28] <CharmSovereign> does this game reward you for tbaggin?
[4:01:33] <RickyRelucent> if ur a fan of the angular one
[4:01:37] <monki_the_goblin> @GIGA255 there's different ai voices you can choose
[4:01:38] <RickyRelucent> that'll do
[4:01:47] <%JoshManVGH> @tusk102 Wait, so this really is a Beta?
[4:01:51] <penitentpendant> The clutch
[4:01:51] <+wmeldrum> good jorb
[4:01:54] <+VestigeOuroboros> does a 360 on top of a dumpster to assert his dominance
[4:01:54] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:01:55] <choocheess> if you stick with the BR you'll get better at hits
[4:02:01] <%GIGA255> thank god. this one sounds like Pomtpo from FFXV
[4:02:05] <RickyRelucent> @JoshManVGH yup
[4:02:06] <%GIGA255> prompto
[4:02:07] <Figleafplays> man i would love to get in and play some games but the time id have to take to get good again is way too much
[4:02:09] <+Cobaltor_252> @JoshManVGH open beta, yeah
[4:02:12] <choocheess> yes
[4:02:17] <+Moaradin> @GIGA255 it is prompto lol
[4:02:22] <BlueSpartan119> you dont wanna spam w/ bulldog, pace your shots
[4:02:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> if you shoot more dudes you'll get better at shooting dudes
[4:02:25] <ShinyVagikarp> ItsHappening
[4:02:28] <%GIGA255> seriously? lol
[4:02:30] <%JoshManVGH> Well damn this is a blast as a beta! 8th is gonna be great!
[4:02:32] <%tusk102> @JoshManVGH sort of but its extended till release and even then its still free and you dont lose progress
[4:02:37] <+AnthraxJohnson> How’s Pat liking the game so far?
[4:02:47] <ShinyVagikarp> nah spamming bulldog ensures kill tho
[4:02:50] <RickyRelucent> pat's loving it as he should
[4:02:53] <%hereiam407> Seems to enjoy it
[4:02:54] <BlueSpartan119> you'll kill in 2 if you let the reticle pull in after ther first shot
[4:02:57] <RickyRelucent> best shooter in recent releases
[4:02:59] <choocheess> i think he means reloading in danger
[4:03:04] <RickyRelucent> cod and battlefield aint got shit on this
[4:03:05] <BlueSpartan119> like the 4 corners
[4:03:07] <RickyRelucent> B U T
[4:03:10] <+VestigeOuroboros> pats strafe game isn't too bad
[4:03:11] <choocheess> nice3
[4:03:12] <%Goatbait> Oooo pretty gun
[4:03:12] <RickyRelucent> its also not, like
[4:03:13] <RickyRelucent> the best
[4:03:16] <RickyRelucent> its digestible halo
[4:03:17] <%dekkitout> Yeah click heads
[4:03:21] <RickyRelucent> not heavy on the stomach at all
[4:03:23] <RickyRelucent> inoffensive
[4:03:25] <+wmeldrum> I like commando chug chug gug ugh
[4:03:27] <ShinyVagikarp> PURR fect
[4:03:28] <choocheess> that guns looks cool
[4:03:34] <%tusk102> it feels good to play
[4:03:39] <%tusk102> therefore it is good
[4:03:41] <choocheess> on your left
[4:03:41] <+ahmz1404> is the Elden Ring network test your GOTY
[4:03:41] <+OotsyMahDootsie> sorry for asking, but is he playing it on PC?
[4:03:41] <%hereiam407> Halo light
[4:03:50] <%superc37> you could try crouching while moving or jumping to make yourself harder to hit
[4:04:04] <%tusk102> i'd prefer a "safe" halo game to one that sucks
[4:04:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> plasma melts shields
[4:04:15] <%hereiam407> Obviously Mass Effect 3 is game of the year for Pat
[4:04:23] <choocheess> i think the alternate fire just spews
[4:04:25] <+OotsyMahDootsie> ah nice
[4:04:28] <BlueSpartan119> you can hold the trigger with that, made the same mistake
[4:04:30] <+wmeldrum> yeah you have to make sure it tracks, it's weird
[4:04:32] <RickyRelucent> @tusk102 I'm just glad we didnt get another halo 4
[4:04:33] <+AnthraxJohnson> I played a few hours this morning and I realized I am old and now ass. I do miss the old announcer as well
[4:04:35] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt did you get a chikcen dinner?
[4:04:37] <%OG_M_Bison> I honestly hope It Takes Two wins all the games awards
[4:04:38] <+shadowblazer1> are both those callout voices Roger Craig Smith?
[4:04:38] <RickyRelucent> hated the fuck out of the floatyy armor
[4:04:45] <%OG_M_Bison> Loved the hell out of that game
[4:04:51] <%tusk102> @RickyRelucent god 4 was. a thing. 5 was better but stil not good
[4:04:55] <choocheess> nice to have interesting games
[4:05:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Oh shit, OBS laying the SMACKDOWN right now
[4:05:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> you did get steak tho
[4:05:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> this just in, streamlabs is scum
[4:05:17] <choocheess> smart
[4:05:19] <RickyRelucent> 5 gameplay was nice, i like the pve+ pvp mode
[4:05:21] <%tusk102> im glad we have reach level spartan customization of individual armor pieces back
[4:05:22] <+wmeldrum> pistol so satisfying
[4:05:32] <RickyRelucent> and the legendary weapons, prophet's bane and CE magnum
[4:05:37] <%tusk102> wish there was custom colors instead of presets
[4:05:45] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> easily the greatest game of a generation, Pat?
[4:05:46] <%blastyoboots> @AlteisenReiseZ what's this about?
[4:05:46] <choocheess> on your left
[4:05:51] <choocheess> behind you
[4:06:03] <cpt_langosta> that good ol kenya vibe...
[4:06:04] <@Ranryu692> Pat you aren't jumping enough. Halo is fought in the air
[4:06:07] <+ahmz1404> on your 6
[4:06:08] <+MillionStabz> guy on the right
[4:06:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat look out!
[4:06:18] <+wmeldrum> watch out
[4:06:19] <%tusk102> the stream has a 3-4 second delay
[4:06:21] <choocheess> yeah im not typing quick either good job though
[4:06:22] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> have you tried cheating, Pat? cheating usually works for me
[4:06:23] <RickyRelucent> same tusk
[4:06:24] <%RigmaroleHM> 2 o'clock
[4:06:25] <Zombrocom> OH MY GOD THEY"RE EVERYWHERE
[4:06:25] <%dekkitout> You sold Ratslayer
[4:06:27] <+ahmz1404> watch out above you
[4:06:29] <%scaryboisupreme> hey pat have you seen the Unit 02 sticker on this map yet
[4:06:30] <RickyRelucent> i want myr each colors back
[4:06:31] <cpt_langosta> you missed a treasure chest in the last room
[4:06:31] <%SWFanatic> Pat don't get hurt
[4:06:31] <+Cobaltor_252> @AlteisenReiseZ from what I saw they pretty much copied another software's website hompage 1:1 in a new redesign
[4:06:33] <RickyRelucent> forest with rust
[4:06:35] <RickyRelucent> : 3
[4:06:36] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @AlteisenReiseZ Streamlabs basically took OBS's name by force, they've also been plagarizing other companies stuff as well
[4:06:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> watch out for that Halo
[4:06:40] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> now we spam early warings
[4:06:42] <+wmeldrum> yeah! just cheat!
[4:06:43] <+ahmz1404> at your feet soldier
[4:06:48] <BlueSpartan119> only callouts you could possible makin in chat is predictive ones
[4:06:51] <%optimasmaximas> @scaryboisupreme THE WHAT
[4:06:58] <+VestigeOuroboros> iillusionary wall ahead
[4:06:59] <%tusk102> @RickyRelucent im a bit peeved over the color presets but boy am i happy to be able to pick each body part+the prosthetics thing
[4:07:00] <BlueSpartan119> like how they're about to push C
[4:07:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Mr Feels tweeted it out too
[4:07:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> just shoot em with it
[4:07:07] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> have they reworked any of the guns for infinite?
[4:07:11] <primaryfire> I definitely had more luck with the battle rifle in reach
[4:07:11] <%tusk102> and having helmet attachments and stuff
[4:07:19] <%terry_irvin> is that yuri lowenthal?
[4:07:26] <+ahmz1404> watch out, enemy
[4:07:28] <voodoolawyer> @primaryfire the BR is not in reach
[4:07:30] <%scaryboisupreme> on one of the stair cases is a sticker of a pigeon with Rebuild Unit 02's head
[4:07:31] <RickyRelucent> exactly, feels good being able to choose what body parts blew up
[4:07:31] <%tusk102> @primaryfire reach didnt have a battle rifle
[4:07:33] <+wmeldrum> is pat playing more btb or arena?
[4:07:38] <choocheess> nice man
[4:07:38] <%tusk102> you mean the dmr?
[4:07:39] <%SWFanatic> GJ pat
[4:07:44] <primaryfire> oh I'm thinking of the wrong name then
[4:07:47] <+OotsyMahDootsie> nicee
[4:07:50] <cpt_langosta> bouncy bouncy fun fun fun fun fun
[4:07:51] <%tusk102> the dmr
[4:07:53] <voodoolawyer> pat what guns you like so far
[4:07:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> get some BTB going for the chaos
[4:07:55] <primaryfire> what's the burst fire rifle
[4:07:55] <%SWFanatic> Goin to sleep, ty for stream
[4:07:57] <%tusk102> the single shot rifle
[4:07:58] <+ahmz1404> how powerful is the melee punch
[4:07:59] <voodoolawyer> also why does the sidekick feel so bad
[4:08:01] <choocheess> BR is good for this distances that you had, for the map probably too close though
[4:08:02] <mikeriffic> arena
[4:08:04] <%optimasmaximas> @PatStaresAt if you ASD with it you can direct the grenade
[4:08:08] <%tusk102> there wasnt a burst fire in reach i dont think
[4:08:09] <RickyRelucent> dmr is the single shot
[4:08:12] <RickyRelucent> seems to be missing$
[4:08:21] <%scaryboisupreme> it's weird so now I'm scanning the maps for any more birds with Evangelion heads
[4:08:23] <+VestigeOuroboros> "Just one more match" seems strong with this one
[4:08:24] <%A_Zealous_Retort> every mode is slayer if you dont play the objective
[4:08:24] <RickyRelucent> whats the box magazine single shot's name?
[4:08:26] <%tusk102> the dmr seems to be replaced by the commando
[4:08:29] <cheap_turbo> YOU DROPPED THE BALL
[4:08:30] <RickyRelucent> it will end up being my fave
[4:08:32] <RickyRelucent> i can tell
[4:08:32] <voodoolawyer> I wonder if they're gonna add more weapons as time goes on
[4:08:33] <%dekkitout> Escalator, escalator- eel~
[4:08:35] <RickyRelucent> >comando
[4:08:35] <cpt_langosta> c'mon south of heaven...!
[4:08:37] <RickyRelucent> cheers
[4:08:37] <@TheYellowcouch> slayer? I hardly knew her
[4:08:37] <sozemd> there is a single shot not called dmr
[4:08:45] <voodoolawyer> like the Halo CE pistol was added to Halo 5 as a power weapon
[4:08:46] <%SaiyanShoto> It would be nice to make a playlist of the game modes you want
[4:08:47] <mikeriffic> side kick is almosy never meant to be used from full to dead. Its more of a "Oh im running low on primary" or their shilds popped and you switch to pop them a head shot
[4:08:47] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt what are your thoughts about the halo so far?
[4:08:48] <choocheess> it's nice when it says you won lol
[4:08:52] <BlueSpartan119> that means you're a good teammate then, thank you Pat
[4:08:53] <+ahmz1404> slayer of demons?
[4:08:54] <+wmeldrum> GBLN clan. is peach MIND
[4:08:57] <%tusk102> commando is good
[4:08:59] <%GIGA255> Your mismatched limbs are bothering me
[4:09:03] <%tusk102> FREE
[4:09:03] <mikeriffic> its a great gun but it isnt meant to serve as a primary
[4:09:06] <%athuramn> has halo always been a 4v4 thing?
[4:09:06] <%RigmaroleHM> Free?
[4:09:08] <+ahmz1404> how much would you pay for it
[4:09:15] <Profmcstevie> WHY it's fantastic we can't seem to figure out....why THIS time is it fantastic
[4:09:15] <BlueSpartan119> Free.99
[4:09:16] <mikeriffic> Would you pay for the game if it was like 20 bucks or something @PatStaresAt ?
[4:09:16] <%strakillias> What do you think f the grenade spam?
[4:09:16] <+diiuvian> Menu music is a vibe
[4:09:16] <choocheess> multi is supposed to stay free too no?
[4:09:20] <%tusk102> 9.99 technically
[4:09:20] <primaryfire> saw off your legs so you can run faster
[4:09:21] <RickyRelucent> @voodoolawyer aww man i hated that shit, MCC collection reach only lets u find the magnum on the floor too
[4:09:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> Battlefield is gonna have to start paying people to play it
[4:09:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> LUL
[4:09:27] <%A_Zealous_Retort> its good, its free, its on PC, Halo is back BAYBEE
[4:09:30] <cpt_langosta> but does it have one MIRION troops?
[4:09:31] <+wmeldrum> if you ignore the flag it's slayer
[4:09:33] <RickyRelucent> i liked having presents with dmr,n assault
[4:09:35] <%athuramn> I'd pay 60 bucks if skins were unlocked but hey, free is okay too
[4:09:36] <%hereiam407> @PatStaresAt Have you played any Halo campaigns?
[4:09:37] <BlueSpartan119> @choocheess free forever and always
[4:09:46] <%RigmaroleHM> The red blue looks like an 80s action figure
[4:09:48] <%tusk102> it needs some stuff fixed but its pretty god damn solid and it looks great
[4:09:57] <choocheess> @choocheess sweet!
[4:09:59] <+Cobaltor_252> I'll never get sick of that intro transition
[4:10:01] <primaryfire> autobots roll out
[4:10:02] <Profmcstevie> Sparticus Prime looking ass
[4:10:05] <+polothegreatest> EVA is almost at the rnd of BP
[4:10:09] <+ahmz1404> does that mean it's going to be pay2win
[4:10:14] <%tusk102> multi is free to play hence its inclusion of a battlepass
[4:10:19] <%tusk102> no
[4:10:26] <choocheess> you would've got that if you had sheilds
[4:10:28] <%LeiaSkynoober> @ahmz1404 No, just pay for skins
[4:10:28] <%tusk102> @ahmz1404 no because weapons are weapons are weapons
[4:10:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> @ahmz1404 there's no loadout, it literally can never be pay2win
[4:10:35] <Zombrocom> No pay to win, just a shitton of overpriced cosmetics
[4:10:39] <%tusk102> you cant pay to win its just cosmetics
[4:10:39] <choocheess> smart

[4:11:20] <+wmeldrum> I like to imagine MC fumbling to his secondary after using plasma pistol
[4:11:24] <+polothegreatest> its sanic AI?
[4:11:33] <BlueSpartan119> I'm so glad they're time skipping over the AI uprising stuff for infinite, was uninterested in that plotline the second I hit credits in Halo 5
[4:11:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[4:11:35] <primaryfire> it surprises me that they still write lines like this nowadays
[4:11:45] <dmtjinni> change the announcer va I dont like him

[4:13:29] <Zombrocom> Cross counter
[4:13:34] <primaryfire> I find it a bit odd that there's an announcer and the AI, especially when they say the exact same thing back to back
[4:13:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> Master of Tre
[4:13:53] <%tusk102> @primaryfire you can shut ai off

[4:18:41] <%WhereIsWill> laynaWHYTHO laynaWHYTHO laynaWHYTHO
[4:18:53] <%A_Zealous_Retort> I wonder what level of AI they backfill with
[4:18:54] <marvel877> @ahmz1404 other people can see them and doesnt this game still have video editing?
[4:18:57] <+carfar_farcar> the bots are pretty good for bots
[4:19:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> that one is a single shot carbine
[4:19:04] <%JoshManVGH> I can't believe it's called the Spanker....
[4:19:04] <doughboidankweed> I haven't watched anything on infinite. what is happening.
[4:19:12] <Brand_M1_AK> is he playing on Xbox or PC?
[4:19:13] <%athuramn> @doughboidankweed it has bots for when people drop out of certain game types, like slayer
[4:19:14] <penitentpendant> Stomp 'O Clock is real!
[4:19:15] <cpt_langosta> looks bogas to me
[4:19:15] <%hereiam407> I miss 007 Nightfire Multiplayer

[4:19:39] <%A_Zealous_Retort> @doughboidankweed multiplayer surprise released yesterday, it is GOOD, but the battle pass is funky
[4:19:41] <+ahmz1404> this is the mouse and kb match
[4:19:42] <%tank7013> These guys are sticking together like glue. Good team
[4:19:45] <@TheYellowcouch> get skunked
[4:19:45] <+MillionStabz> I thought this game being F2P would encourage kids to play so I could stomp them
[4:19:50] <%studleydoorite> this seems like a 4 queue
[4:19:52] <%hereiam407> What a hoser
[4:19:52] <%JoshManVGH> @vestigeouroboros I never knew cause there was
[4:19:55] <Donkeyshspittle> Hey pat, longtime fan! Is there a way to hit you up for game recommendations? wanted to ask and not rudely tweet to you on twitter or something first.

[4:20:20] <%KnightOfTrousers> Cheer1000 Hello Pat the Orbmeister. My friends despise the name "Spanker" for the SPNKR rocket launcher. Do you have any thoughts? Hope you're killing many spartans and getting many battle passes.
[4:20:22] <toomuchsnarf> Did he grapple?
[4:20:33] <Brand_M1_AK> why is he not playing on Keyboard + mouse?

[4:25:39] <+VestigeOuroboros> @PatStaresAt Something to try if you feel your aim is kinda off, they have the deadzones for the "look" stick cranked as high as the "movement" stick, aside from axial it feels better on 0.
