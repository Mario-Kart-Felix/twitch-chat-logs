[0:18:48] <+Kurogane_Dread> Still need to unlock Crystal Tower and Sky Pirate Alliance raids
[0:18:50] <%tyler274> the best way to farm genesis is eureka
[0:18:51] <%spiritofmojave> Yummy tomes
[0:18:53] <%Taisuru> Genesis
[0:18:54] <@JustinianKnight> Genesis
[0:18:57] <%tyler274> you can get to cap in anemos in a few hours

[0:19:08] <jujushermo> @AngriestPat are their any plans to stream samurai showdown when it comes out?
[0:19:08] <%spiritofmojave> Scavean gear is like 390 I think
[0:19:11] <+plasticss> and throw some materia on it too
[0:19:16] <+Mr_FruitzNutz> gfrShock
[0:19:17] <@JustinianKnight> you also need to do Omega 4 times for weapon
[0:19:21] <+Zepshire> 390 gear + alliance coins = ilvl 400 gear
[0:19:23] <+Roundelay11> I'll probably just level a bunch of classes, 65 now
[0:19:23] <MetelStar> What would you say to those interested in Eureka?
[0:19:24] <RamenRiderZ> Just do Eureka Kappa
[0:19:27] <LongLivetheEmpire> just git gud be the best Ninja
[0:19:28] <%og_reesetti> And you can upgrade that weapon to i400 with alliance coins
[0:19:29] <arknodem> Just got here and Pat is reminding me to do Roullettes
[0:19:32] <+taeasakura> Just do Eureka Kappa
[0:19:33] <Rhonne> question about those end game weapons, do they go back and add new ones for the new classes?

[0:24:22] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat you can get that easy mode
[0:24:22] <%Arnschen> Same, not a fan of the weapons
[0:24:25] <%tyler274> the tank armor is easy to get
[0:24:28] <%Nikopol1717> That fending set is the shit
[0:24:28] <+Roundelay11> You gonna stay a Roe?
[0:24:30] <snowmanse> The weapons do look terrible, but the tank armor looks like neon Judge armor.

[0:24:46] <RamenRiderZ> You can level the Eureka in a week
[0:24:46] <arknodem> Same
[0:24:49] <%blastazoid26> it will
[0:24:51] <Mastigias> They'll probably make it soloable
[0:24:52] <+DoctorDerp388> eureka's absolutely dead day 1 of early access
[0:24:53] <%og_reesetti> All you need for the tank gear is crystals from Pyros and Hydatos
[0:24:53] <%Nobrev> the only weapon I cared for was the murgelis anemos for my red mage
[0:24:57] <$valriot> Of course it will
[0:24:58] <@JustinianKnight> it won't completely die
[0:25:00] <Angry_Ev1L> @AngriestPat just ask your viewers to play with you

[0:25:19] <$DarkKnightGrave> ALL GAME NO LIFE
[0:25:25] <@JustinianKnight> not really that bad
[0:25:26] <%nyurgh> Ninja gives enough leeway

[0:25:35] <EL_TRO> Primal boys?
[0:25:36] <+TheImmortal70> Ninja is probably going to be the worst
[0:25:38] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat i have a friend that plays ninja from the united arab emirates fine

[0:25:50] <%og_reesetti> Ninja is probably gonna be really tough
[0:25:50] <anAngryHamster> 120 ping ain't bad
[0:25:51] <+wsmccall> it's not great but it'll add up over an encounter

[0:25:59] <+UrielCobalt> Ninja is my spirit animal, so I must at least make a ninja
[0:26:00] <%Arnschen> Not that bad
[0:26:01] <GrandmasterBFunk> i ninja'd as an aussie on JP servers, it's not horrible, but annoying and you can drop shit everyonce in a while
[0:26:02] <%brave_sj> "Ninjas in the chat" LUL
[0:26:03] <%BlitzNeidhart> MCH will be unplayable
[0:26:04] <%nyurgh> Just dont try to spam your Mudra so you dont accidentally double tap

[0:26:06] <acedeone> WOOOSH
[0:26:09] <$valriot> Yeah but they probably suck
[0:26:12] <%spiritofmojave> 120 ping is possible Ninja, as a Monk positional seems like they'd suck
[0:26:14] <+wsmccall> the big thing i've heard is that with ninki being changed it'll be worse on but it's still playable
[0:26:18] <%Guardiansaiyan> ?!
[0:26:21] <%Guardiansaiyan> WOAH
[0:26:27] <KungFuStarfish> Machinists drool mhite mages rule
[0:26:30] <Sydin18> I AM DOING BOTH
[0:26:30] <%sshen> Honestly, I've considered looking into VPNs for 14 to bring my ping down
[0:26:31] <%Ilpala> I'm gonna do both
[0:26:31] <arknodem> Definitely doing both.
[0:26:31] <BustRobot> There are no ninjas in the chat. If there were they would not make themselves known
[0:26:33] <r_Foeburden87> << AM doing both
[0:26:34] <+TheImmortal70> Yeah ninki is gained from weaponskills now
[0:26:36] <%Maruko19> Machinist sucks right now. (I main this job)
[0:26:36] <Joker_Akira> I'm farming MGP while watching this soooo
[0:26:36] <bathoi> high ping on ninja is possible its just not gonna be great for your dps
[0:26:39] <$DarkKnightGrave> Nothing like listening to Pat while fishing in Warframe. Ha. Ha. I want to die.
[0:26:39] <%cirdrag> am doing both!!!
[0:26:41] <%Svanyr> Ill do both, gotta get them CT runs in
[0:26:41] <Atraxa> im doing both
[0:26:42] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah do both
[0:26:42] <DjFrostBite95> I'm doing both rooH
[0:26:43] <+UrielCobalt> probably doesn't have dual monitors
[0:26:43] <+TheImmortal70> So the lag will actually slow down the ninki gain compared to auto attack
[0:26:45] <Kaslez> am doing both

I'm sorry you had to experience first-hand the most obnoxious side of a fanbase. It's a bummer that a group I consider myself part of can be such a bother to one of my favorite streamers.
[0:31:36] <+6PoundsofShrimp> won't that lead to more quarters being thrown at the strippers?
[0:31:42] <masso101> It has like those tables with the arcade machines in them, and on top of that is a stripper pole
[0:31:48] <GrandmasterBFunk> heavensward's story was so good
[0:31:50] <wunderkindest> The fight in 4.3 is probably a better fight overall though
[0:31:51] <Shotred> Do you think we will ever get a single player FF game in this world canon or style ever again???
[0:31:52] <$DarkKnightGrave> I would put a buck into a chunners gstring.

[0:40:15] <%TheAverageSimon> It's the best worst dungeon in the game
[0:40:16] <jackythefrost> This is the worst dungeon in the game IMO
[0:40:17] <r_Foeburden87> What Food though ?
[0:40:17] <ELJOVENBATALI> nice sword, where'd you get it? the sword store?
[0:40:18] <%Ser_Ser_Ser> it's a not fun dungeon
[0:40:19] <%probablypoisonous> cheer500 In the podcast you mentioned you could go for hours about the small quality changes that take a 4 to a 9 or vice versa. Since bloodborne is your fav fromsoft game, what QoL change could bloodborne get to kick it to a 10/10?
[0:40:20] <%probablypoisonous> reward A Cheer shared Rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[0:40:20] <%Nikopol1717> @AngriestPat Best way to grind poetics for the relic quest?
[0:40:21] <+SlowLikeThunder> Oh GOD this one
[0:40:22] <Dastardry> knives on 2 mobs? noooooooob
[0:40:22] <%Jamejarrs> As a healre, I LOATHED this my first go
[0:40:22] <parkslady> hold up I been here fuck this place
[0:40:22] <Forester_Skippy> this dungeon is also rather short but boy you would never guess
[0:40:24] <%CitrusDrink> BRD has the Aural Chapeau though so good for them
[0:40:24] <%korth367> yeah
[0:40:24] <KungFuStarfish> Enjoy slow pulling jerk
[0:40:24] <TioXyco> this whole place is hell
[0:40:27] <Atraxa> actually the worst
[0:40:28] <%korth367> stand in that fire pat
[0:40:28] <%nyurgh> Why is the DPS standing in the pool
[0:40:28] <+VoidShaman> P
[0:40:29] <Sydin18> like right now
[0:40:31] <TioXyco> especially the piss on the floor
[0:40:32] <+ciprofloxacin> does it include standing in garbage?
[0:40:33] <Zepik> As a healer main I can't stand Vale
[0:40:34] <+megamanx74> hey chat! is Pat going to be a lion dude?
[0:40:35] <zecht89> i love pulling everything
[0:40:36] <+Kavtech> Nice positioning Pat.
[0:40:37] <+MisterCrimson> all the worst enemies in the game are here
[0:40:38] <Anubis> pat are you staying as a roe on release or fantasia to hrothgar?
[0:40:38] <HeadsHeldHigh> It wasn't that bad
[0:40:40] <suikudo> worst dungeon in the entire game
[0:40:41] <+UrielCobalt> got those bad ass bladed tonfas
[0:40:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> There is a big chance if your group is dumb you pull everything in this room
[0:40:42] <%AquilaHarukaze> Those puddles are yellow that means they give you TP
[0:40:42] <+SlowLikeThunder> This was really "fun" to do as a tank main who was learning the game
[0:40:45] <%CitrusDrink> You get like 500 poetics from MSQ Roulette
[0:40:45] <+metalsiren31> MSQ and alliance raid
[0:40:46] <+VoidShaman> Personally I prefer Palace of the Dead, but only sometimes...
[0:40:46] <%CMash2k> stand in the piss
[0:40:47] <Bad1uck> Pat standing in the Bile like a scrub
[0:40:49] <xeros720> oh, no wonder i got full commendations when i healed here
[0:40:49] <%Verd_254> had a healer who didn't have their job the first time I did this
[0:40:49] <jackythefrost> PotD gives you a lot of poetics
[0:40:51] <+TheImmortal70> There is an ACTUAL none 0 chance that you can die in this room and it not be anybodies fault
[0:40:52] <%ecolli37108> and make friends with newbies that havent done things
[0:40:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> Which is a bad idea
[0:40:54] <+MisterCrimson> I seen it
[0:40:56] <HeadsHeldHigh> get outta the bile
[0:40:58] <Frostydough> thats a chonker right there
[0:41:00] <%spiritofmojave> stand in that pee jermaMustard
[0:41:04] <Calek> what's the L icon next to Putty G's class icon
[0:41:04] <KitsuneManami> LOL NIN
[0:41:07] <+Roundelay11> LET HIM DIE
[0:41:08] <braincraft> Are there any MMOs that don't split roles up into tank, healer, dps?
[0:41:08] <%crimsonharvest> Why the fuck am I watching this when I could be suffering through it first-hand?
[0:41:08] <%nyurgh> lmao what a bad dps
[0:41:08] <+griffball13> bad dps
[0:41:09] <Rhonne> i always start every dungeon and raid by inspecting the outfits of all of my allies and seeing how they'd look on me
[0:41:11] <+DoctorDerp388> NICE AGGRO PAT
[0:41:13] <$Valdorick> 1,000,000 things can go wrong, AND PAT WILL DO 1,000,001!
[0:41:13] <+Ell1ot> let Pat die!
[0:41:19] <MoonObscure> it begins :3
[0:41:22] <+Ell1ot> he will never learn if you help him
[0:41:22] <%TheAverageSimon> TRUE NORTH PAT
[0:41:23] <transporterthesequel> It's called PULL ASSISTING PEOPLE
[0:41:23] <%spiritofmojave> Healer adjust
[0:41:25] <Forester_Skippy> best way is que for level 60 raid you get 110-120 per fight because you usually have newcomemrs thts how i got my full tnak and dancer gear ready upgraded today
[0:41:26] <+AllenDeadman> this place as monk must be even worse...
[0:41:29] <ConLin_Arts_> I had to do this one twice as I accidentally abandoned the Maelstrom Quest that needed it done
[0:41:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> Fuckin deeps
[0:41:31] <braincraft> And also, when did the trinity start? Was that an Everquest thing?
[0:41:32] <garbageheaphound> nice going jackass
[0:41:32] <RadShiro> Aurum Vale sucks becuz of THE FIRST HELL ROOM
[0:41:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> I can see now why Pat doesn't do Ninja
[0:41:36] <Bad1uck> Pat freaking out and NOT PULLING THE MOBS BACK SO THE TANK DOESN'T AGGRO MORE STUFF
[0:41:36] <Angry_Ev1L> you guys are over dramatic about this dungeon lol
[0:41:37] <jackythefrost> @braincraft BDO does but that game is bad
[0:41:37] <%nyurgh> USE IT
[0:41:38] <+Roundelay11> I don't bother with positionals unless its a boss
[0:41:41] <%spiritofmojave> @allendeadman oh it is awful
[0:41:41] <+Freeasacar> ARR Alliance raids are fast poetics right now because of the philosophy event
[0:41:42] <%nyurgh> ITS GETTING CHARGES PAT
[0:41:43] <$Rockgagong> so is positionals just your attacks that do more/different stuff if you're behind or whatever? Like the pugilist?
[0:41:46] <ELJOVENBATALI> will crazy talk save pat?
[0:41:46] <Sydin18> Coward North
[0:41:47] <%crimsonharvest> GOAD NINJA
[0:41:52] <+metalsiren31> As a tank main what's a positional pvpSass
[0:41:53] <+DoctorDerp388> OL "NO POSITIONALS" PAT LUL
[0:41:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> no Katon?
[0:42:00] <+Hxc_crazyman> Omg I see so many NIN's who don't even realize they have positionals now
[0:42:00] <transporterthesequel> He's right he's got Trick Attack
[0:42:02] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Shillk) (warning)
[0:42:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> GOAD RIDDANCE
[0:42:06] <TheEvilOmega> I miss Assassin from Guild Wars. That class was the most fun.
[0:42:08] <%ogtrashwizard> @AngriestPat Using hide out of combat resets your mudras, just to let you know
[0:42:09] <BunnyEmperor> Aurum Vale is the best dungeon pre 50 and you can fight me on that
[0:42:09] <+Bipolarhernandez> But Pat, we literally pay your sub
[0:42:11] <Latija> lol Aurum Vale
[0:42:12] <%korth367> NO
[0:42:18] <ConLin_Arts_> @AngriestPat beat the MSQ for ARR just now, it has been a fun couple of weeks but now I need some time off!
[0:42:19] <Jdrockefeller> woo piss dungeon
[0:42:20] <+metalsiren31> pvpLUL
[0:42:20] <%LegendCobra> actually tank does have to worry about it
[0:42:20] <Bielzitcho> @Rockgagong positionals deal more damage or give you more resources if you hit them at the proper place
[0:42:21] <Rhonne> you a little big to be a ninja
[0:42:22] <%korth367> WORRY ABOUT POSITIONAL AS A TANK man
[0:42:25] <RadShiro> Pat confirmed TRASH DPS
[0:42:25] <NoirePanzer> Mudra mudra mudra mudra mudra mudra
[0:42:26] <+MisterCrimson> am tank and caster, no need positionals
[0:42:35] <+Sendaar> So I heard healers are getting gutted in shadowbringers?
[0:42:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> Positionals -> Abilities that get a bonus based on your position regards to the enemy.
[0:42:38] <$Rockgagong> got it, ty. I figured but wasnt sure
[0:42:39] <Comrade_Vladof> Positionals is something only NIN DRG and MNK have to care about
[0:42:40] <%samantha_ah> samantha_ah subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Thanks for doing the FFXIV primer a few nights ago! I just started last month and found it super helpful
[0:42:41] <jackythefrost> @AngriestPat Whats your favorite DPS
[0:42:43] <+DoctorDerp388> read your tooltips people
[0:42:45] <Dastardry> I guess it's for the good of all that Pat mains a tank.
[0:42:46] <+DoctorDerp388> especially provoke
[0:42:46] <+Deosier> how bad is this place for healers?
[0:42:47] <%korth367> melee dps will love you
[0:42:49] <Jdrockefeller> also that mudra thing is super cool I had no idea
[0:42:50] <ittla> aurum vale???? what a nerd
[0:42:50] <soundoftruth64> Is 14 worth playing on PS4? Or is it trash in comparison?
[0:42:52] <SilverFaustX> xenoblade 3 is being made release 2021
[0:42:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> You do more damage from behind, for example
[0:42:57] <%nyurgh> Mudras are fun JD
[0:43:01] <jackythefrost> @soundoftruth64 Its exactly the same
[0:43:01] <lionmanguy> Oh fuck
[0:43:02] <masso101> Ok so as a monk main, what is a positional. Kappa
[0:43:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> 14 is fine to great on PS4
[0:43:03] <lionmanguy> !uptime
[0:43:04] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 43m 5s.
[0:43:12] <lionmanguy> Oh he actually started early for once
[0:43:12] <transporterthesequel> @soundoftruth64 It's super good on PS4
[0:43:15] <DjFrostBite95> rooD no u
[0:43:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> >_>
[0:43:21] <%AquilaHarukaze> Oh no
[0:43:21] <%CitrusDrink> I always forget how many ticks it is before you eat the fruit in here
[0:43:22] <+TheImmortal70> COOLDOWNS PAT
[0:43:24] <%SilvaChariot0133> Oh bloody hell
[0:43:24] <%korth367> no
[0:43:25] <Bad1uck> @MisterCrimson We worry about positionals on ourselves (WAR does at least)
[0:43:26] <%mayorrev> pat no
[0:43:27] <%spiritofmojave> True North is not consunable
[0:43:28] <alwayspronking> oh not this again
[0:43:28] <%nyurgh> Pat
[0:43:29] <Dio_TR> What the fuck is E3 even for everything has been leaked
[0:43:29] <+TheImmortal70> PAT
[0:43:30] <%mayorrev> apatGoblin
[0:43:30] <ConLin_Arts_> For some reason the group I was with for the Ultima Weapon dungeon completely melted all the bosses
[0:43:31] <%SilvaChariot0133> PAT
[0:43:31] <NemokillerV> the goblins
[0:43:32] <%EmiinV> does pat have huton up
[0:43:32] <%korth367> @AngriestPat dont you fucking start
[0:43:32] <+metalsiren31> pvpSK
[0:43:32] <%AquilaHarukaze> Cooldowns are consumables.
[0:43:33] <%Finaldragoon> M I N D G O B L I N
[0:43:33] <bendatron> NOT MIND GOBLINS
[0:43:33] <%flying_hipp0> wot
[0:43:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> @masso101 It's an ability that works better from a particular position relating to your target.
[0:43:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> THE DAMAGE
[0:43:35] <GrandmasterBFunk> me too pat
[0:43:35] <Jdrockefeller> when did they add that effect to hide
[0:43:35] <+TheImmortal70> Mother FUCKER
[0:43:36] <Sydin18> I think its weird cause I need a button just for it or I forget about it
[0:43:36] <Foggysheep> true north is potions
[0:43:37] <Pallion_> It's such a short cd tho
[0:43:37] <+Hxc_crazyman> I believe True North is getting Charges in ShB
[0:43:37] <soundoftruth64> I’ve been thinking about getting into it but I’m worried about mmos on a controller
[0:43:41] <%nyurgh> as a NIN your trick attack takes longer to recast than True North
[0:43:41] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[0:43:41] <%mrshazboto> So what you're saying is that the cooldown is CONSUMABLE?
[0:43:43] <$Rockgagong> Is positionals not really a thing if you're soloing since enemies kinda stick to your ass? Or am I not supposed to be soloing LMAO
[0:43:44] <Anubis> if you're using it to guarantee Trick Attack it's never a waster @AngriestPat
[0:43:44] <%crimsonharvest> If you need a cooldown in a pug queue youre gonna die
[0:43:45] <%flying_hipp0> apatGoblin rly
[0:43:48] <Rhonne> temporary buff!
[0:43:49] <Sydin18> Time for frog
[0:43:50] <+dasmause> just use it with Trick Attack since hitting the positional on THAT is most important
[0:43:52] <$Rockgagong> like quests etc
[0:43:53] <%AquilaHarukaze> Just use it on your openers and never any other time
[0:43:54] <%LegendCobra> its not even that important
[0:43:54] <%EmiinV> FFXIV is actually super strong on controller @soundoftruth64
[0:43:57] <Bielzitcho> true north is gonna have charges and a 45 sec cooldown if i'm not mistaken...
[0:43:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> No one tells Knuckles which way is True North!
[0:43:59] <%CitrusDrink> Get outta the goo
[0:43:59] <AMaidIndeed> Just use it for Trick Attack security and git gud for everything else >:O
[0:44:00] <Forester_Skippy> true north is only for boss mechanics you cant hit positionals
[0:44:01] <%CitrusDrink> THE GOO
[0:44:01] <+Adohbuu> Good thing that shit is getting a 45s CD with 2 charges
[0:44:03] <Bad1uck> @soundoftruth64 Yes FF14 is great on a controller
[0:44:09] <+TheImmortal70> @angriestpat You want to save it, but did you know by not using it you are ACTIVELY wasting it's value ?
[0:44:17] <%nyurgh> NIN is awful when you get scaled down
[0:44:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Rockgagong If youre going solo, positionals are moot. You don't usually get the bonuses anyway
[0:44:18] <%EmiinV> pat your huton
[0:44:18] <Rhonne> man i hate this place
[0:44:20] <+MisterCrimson> @Bad1uck if your back is to the mobs as a tank, you are bad tank
[0:44:20] <%EmiinV> oh noooo
[0:44:24] <+TheImmortal70> This boss sucks
[0:44:26] <%TIME_PUNCHER> TIME_PUNCHER subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[0:44:32] <%CitrusDrink> Just gotta eat a fruit
[0:44:32] <%spiritofmojave> here's where the fun begins
[0:44:37] <+RaziWraith> BabyRage boss LUL
[0:44:41] <AdmiralButtloaf> this boss is a healer challenge
[0:44:43] <%Jungos60> Damn, I've been doin em at 3 stacks lol
[0:44:45] <TheEvilOmega> I do it at 3 like a MAN.
[0:44:52] <$TsundereFFXIV> 0 GCD Trick PogChamp
[0:44:53] <%General_Terro> you do it at 3 stacks if you arnt a little bitch
[0:44:54] <Forester_Skippy> thats an early trick
[0:44:56] <%spiritofmojave> I hated doing this fight as a SCH first time
[0:44:56] <$Rockgagong> Alright cool, I was wondering if I just was supposed to have sick-nasty footwork to get the flank/behind hits
[0:45:00] <%CitrusDrink> Is this Bard not using it's DOTs?
[0:45:01] <NoirePanzer> I've always heard it was at 3 lol
[0:45:03] <%CitrusDrink> USE YOUR DOTS
[0:45:07] <%Leodude> Aurum Vale? I'm sorry for your loss.
[0:45:15] <Comrade_Vladof> That Naruto shit
[0:45:16] <TheEvilOmega> This Bard is NOT using their DoTs.
[0:45:18] <Aussie_Manny> like bort's dad
[0:45:19] <NumbusPlays> h-hayai
[0:45:21] <+ToppaTenga> just weaponskill
[0:45:22] <%Guardiansaiyan> MercyWing1 apatBlep MercyWing2
[0:45:23] <+Hxc_crazyman> Pop Bloodlust and fight through the pain if you're a real man Kappa
[0:45:26] <ittla> people warned me about the aurum vale but then I never had trouble with it. the trouble comes from fools who fuck up at this easy dungeon
[0:45:30] <%Fidranth> he is pat just has them off
[0:45:34] <%spiritofmojave> Feint: Am I a joke to you?
[0:45:34] <+Ell1ot> i want to play a class with big explosions. any suggestions?
[0:45:35] <Thalchampz> i thought he was going to forget LUL
[0:45:36] <%mrshazboto> It's like running with your hands behind your back. When you do dumb ninja bullshit, you do it faster
[0:45:37] <+Ryutaryi> The other DOTs don't show on his bar.
[0:45:40] <CuriousReborn> Naruto PogChamp
[0:45:43] <%CitrusDrink> Ahh
[0:45:43] <jackythefrost> So its like Ley Lines for BLM
[0:45:44] <SweetCuppingCake> @TheEvilOmega Oh no, you're right
[0:45:45] <Sydin18> But u aint dyeing ur clothes orange
[0:45:51] <Atraxa> i hate Vale so much if i get tank queued into it, i get someone from my FC to take my place
[0:45:52] <AdmiralButtloaf> doton
[0:45:53] <%CitrusDrink> Ok that makes more sense
[0:45:55] <transporterthesequel> All these non-Samurai things sound EXHAUSTING
[0:45:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Rockgagong If your taget has a big move and you can get off front you can get the bonuses, but if you're playing solo or versus trash, the bonuses don't make enough difference to try and be a hero.
[0:45:56] <+SlowLikeThunder> Putty eat the fruit please you're the chosen one BibleThump
[0:45:59] <Foggysheep> @Ell1ot black mage
[0:46:00] <+darienmask> I tune in and it's Aurum Vale, so sorry
[0:46:00] <Comrade_Vladof> Black Mage is maximum explosions
[0:46:01] <@JustinianKnight> hmm
[0:46:02] <+Ryutaryi> I saw that a long time ago with a Dragoon who I thought wasn't using Chaos Thrust.
[0:46:03] <%Guardiansaiyan> I want a Goku class please..
[0:46:04] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Yuo even get a giant frog later

[0:46:14] <ittla> naruto ninjas are just knife wizards
[0:46:14] <Applecannon63> Monk=Goku
[0:46:16] <AdmiralButtloaf> When you sprint with your daggers drawn you do a Naruto run
[0:46:16] <Bad1uck> @MisterCrimson lol, you don't always get a choice on mob positions. Especially during dungeons that come with waves of adds
[0:46:19] <jackythefrost> Since Ley Lines increase Spell speed by 15%
[0:46:20] <$Valdorick> Would Woolie be a Naruto, or a Punch Girl?
[0:46:21] <%AncelDeLambert> what about the Rock Lee class?
[0:46:22] <%spiritofmojave> Monk is Goku now
[0:46:24] <+dasmause> @AngriestPat you ever had trouble remembering mudras?
[0:46:29] <+RaziWraith> Just because he does ninja symbols doesn't mean we have to compare him to Naruto! BabyRage
[0:46:29] <thewhiterice92> What’s the One Piece class?
[0:46:32] <jackythefrost> @AncelDeLambert Thats Monk
[0:46:32] <Parapattern> Go home. Watch Naruto.
[0:46:34] <+RubADubDucky> rip brd

[0:46:42] <%spiritofmojave> Bard LUL
[0:46:42] <DjFrostBite95> rippp
[0:46:42] <TheEvilOmega> Oh man, this Bard is going to make me feel bad because I play Bard.
[0:46:42] <%General_Terro> shit brd
[0:46:43] <+Roundelay11> He's probably new
[0:46:43] <%Ilpala> putty is the newest
[0:46:46] <suikudo> Typical bard
[0:46:47] <+TheImmortal70> Putty wanted to save the fruit's value
[0:46:51] <xeros720> bard sucks
[0:46:52] <$mishtershmee> AURUM VAAAAALE
[0:46:54] <+Boscuito> he is doing his best!
[0:46:54] <%Ilpala> not even using the dot you get sub level 10
[0:46:54] <ConLin_Arts_> I a Monk, gonna be fun seeing the changes that comes
[0:46:59] <%Supertoaster02> now that's an authentic experience in that dungeon
[0:47:05] <%crimsonharvest> eat the fuckin fruit
[0:47:08] <AdmiralButtloaf> the rest of this dungeon is easier
[0:47:14] <Forester_Skippy> atleast you arnt getting shirked and rescued for stream funsies
[0:47:14] <%AquilaHarukaze> eat the FROOT
[0:47:15] <+michingmallecho> BlessRNG
[0:47:16] <%Ser_Ser_Ser> It's okay Putty, youll be a good brd someday
[0:47:17] <%Verd_254> i do it all the time
[0:47:17] <+RaziWraith> Typical ranged classes standing around thinking their invincible. KappaHD
[0:47:18] <%nyurgh> NIN jump is why I picked the class
[0:47:20] <$Rockgagong> do you also get to run with your arms out behind you?
[0:47:20] <+MisterCrimson> the gold stuff is a buff, be sure to stand in it
[0:47:21] <%D33TR> arent ninjas slightly faster
[0:47:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> So far this is the best non-solo run of AV I've witnessed.
[0:47:25] <Sydin18> How does that make sense? it doesnt
[0:47:29] <ConLin_Arts_> The Changes for the classes are like for everyone, not only people with ShB right?
[0:47:30] <%TheAverageSimon> They go slightly faster too
[0:47:31] <haveswordmuststing> fall damage LUL
[0:47:31] <DjFrostBite95> cool PogChamp
[0:47:32] <Jolnir> whens pandas?
[0:47:33] <TheEvilOmega> Nah, Bards are slightly faster because Peloton.
[0:47:36] <%SilvaChariot0133> Let them hatch for more xp
[0:47:38] <%CitrusDrink> Let 'em pop!
[0:47:39] <jackythefrost> I should level NIN
[0:47:40] <$Valdorick> I remember this place, this place is awful.
[0:47:43] <%CitrusDrink> Get the XP!
[0:47:43] <DjFrostBite95> Pandas? rooVV
[0:47:44] <Jdrockefeller> nins move slightly faster yeah as a trait
[0:47:50] <Anubis> mobxp Kreygasm
[0:48:00] <$OranHexthief> i mean but does the less fall damage really matter when the dragoon can use it's backwards hop to just teleport to the bottom of a cliff pat LUL
[0:48:05] <xeros720> is pat's inventory bigger?
[0:48:05] <%Ilpala> which is why they're being killed Kappa
[0:48:07] <%AquilaHarukaze> I always try to let them pop. But DPS tend to mop them up and make me sad.
[0:48:07] <Sydin18> Putty got the bad breath
[0:48:07] <GundamF91> yeah Ninja literally gets a movement speed trait
[0:48:08] <$Valdorick> Bard Breathed
[0:48:13] <Bad1uck> Letting them spawn isn't worth the hassle of those fuckers
[0:48:14] <Psatou> iirc letting them hatch is 11x more exp
[0:48:14] <$mishtershmee> Putty smells bad
[0:48:20] <%arcaderabbit48> Here's hoping hoping Shadowbringers finally brings us Aurm Vale (Hard)!
[0:48:21] <TheEvilOmega> Did that Bard eat a Bad Breath?
[0:48:22] <%Unlimited_> @ConLin_Arts_ yes
[0:48:24] <Atraxa> The earring is the only reason i Pre ordered
[0:48:29] <ConLin_Arts_> neato
[0:48:30] <SweetCuppingCake> No, letting them pop means you have to be in here longer
[0:48:31] <TheEvilOmega> How do you... how do you get hit by that?
[0:48:32] <@JustinianKnight> Ninja gets innate move speed boost and less fall damage
[0:48:35] <%SilvaChariot0133> PLS NO
[0:48:36] <%TheAverageSimon> @arcaderabbit48 I would totally love that
[0:48:39] <%spiritofmojave> Oh god NO
[0:48:39] <revenant4444> @angriestpat thanks for dragging me back into this with all your tweeting about it, god dammit lol
[0:48:40] <%SilvaChariot0133> THEY'LL DO IT

[0:48:52] <TioXyco> pat no
[0:48:53] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> It was already in the game back in 1.0, we don't need it. it's fine.
[0:48:53] <+Hxc_crazyman> Letting the eggs hatch is what the XP gain in this place massive.
[0:48:54] <Sydin18> I would for fun times
[0:48:54] <Bad1uck> Fuck all of you for wanting that
[0:48:55] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@CitrusDrink) (warning)
[0:48:56] <+Roundelay11> Pat the masochist
[0:48:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> Warrior I went from 46 to 50 in two runs. And I suck at tanking. Like BIIIIIG suck.

[0:49:11] <%Guardiansaiyan> @KitsuneManami does it work here?
[0:49:16] <Saltmeisterr> whats pat talking about?
[0:49:34] <+SlowLikeThunder> Ninja is a gathering class, I see
[0:49:36] <Atraxa> The entire floor is just poison on hard
[0:49:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat is talking about nothing.
[0:49:41] <TheEvilOmega> The Bard is using their songs... but nothing else?
[0:49:43] <%crimsonharvest> GOAD YOU USELESS WEEB
[0:49:53] <$Rockgagong> the image of pat sneaking about while his party is mauled by scorpions is just what I need from this game
[0:49:54] <Bad1uck> Infamous for being a pile of shit
[0:49:55] <%AquilaHarukaze> Goad the putty!
[0:49:56] <%SMT_Izanagi> SMT_Izanagi subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:50:03] <KitsuneManami> CRAZY TALK ACTIVATES
[0:50:05] <%AuksMattin> @AngriestPat did you see pre-E3 leaks of GRRM+FromSoft confirmation on "Elden Ring" not "Great Rune"?
[0:50:05] <$DarkKnightGrave> Pat is going full Boruto.
[0:50:11] <1matheuw> excuse me what am i watching?
[0:50:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> The remix of Satasha is pretty alright
[0:50:14] <%Ilpala> guys, pat has setting that only shows your debuffs. scholar's miasma/bio isn't showing up either
[0:50:15] <%Guardiansaiyan> @SMT_Izanagi congrats
[0:50:17] <+TheImmortal70> Aurum vale hard but it's the First's aurum vale filled with fucked up angels and poison
[0:50:18] <%SilvaChariot0133> PAT
[0:50:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> GOAD RIDDANCE
[0:50:20] <BunnyEmperor> YOU NEED IT UNTIL SHADOWBRINGERS FFS
[0:50:23] <%spiritofmojave> Goad BYE
[0:50:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> No more TP in Shadowbringers
[0:50:26] <BunnyEmperor> Ignorant Pat
[0:50:26] <%nyurgh> why is his TP so low
[0:50:28] <%crimsonharvest> I stopped playing ninja cause of goad yelling
[0:50:29] <%AquilaHarukaze> cry
[0:50:31] <+tasenhall> so you can play FF14 on a controller really easily?
[0:50:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> You gotta use the bidet
[0:50:32] <+Roundelay11> God, fuck TP
[0:50:33] <Bad1uck> Does BRD have peon at this level?
[0:50:33] <%BlitzNeidhart> No Diversion NotLikeThis
[0:50:34] <transporterthesequel> Hmm yes sound DPS logic
[0:50:34] <%nyurgh> I dont have TP issues when I play
[0:50:36] <ConLin_Arts_> I barely notice my TP going low
[0:50:38] <Jdrockefeller> good idea I am removing goad right now
[0:50:40] <CuriousReborn> AOE skills drain your TP really fast
[0:50:40] <%TheAverageSimon> No more TP is a godsend man. I'm so glad it's gone
[0:50:46] <excedebuster> I hear Pats voice twice cause I’m watching old fisticuffs lol
[0:50:49] <%Guardiansaiyan> @AngriestPat what is this theme called thats playing?
[0:50:49] <+Rainehero> Noone's going to have TP issues next patch
[0:50:49] <TheEvilOmega> Odds on Bard eating the eyeball laser in the face?
[0:50:50] <ittla> spamming AOEs is fun
[0:50:51] <+SlowLikeThunder> oh doesn't this guy have an AoE that dopesnt actually have any AoE indicator
[0:50:51] <%LegendCobra> dragoon gets tp issues when you spam your aoe combo
[0:50:51] <%spiritofmojave> Thank god TP is outta here
[0:50:52] <transporterthesequel> Also Pat your controller shit is roping in SO MANY PEOPLE
[0:50:52] <ittla> good riddance
[0:50:53] <%AquilaHarukaze> Going to be happy to see TP gone
[0:50:54] <+Roundelay11> TP drain on SAM AOE sucks
[0:50:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Diversion is more trouble than it's worth
[0:51:01] <%mishtershmee> mishtershmee subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:51:03] <TioXyco> only time I have TP issues is when I quick spam Quick Knock
[0:51:07] <%mrshazboto> So when leveling - as a DPS how conscious should your be of pulling aggro from your tank?
[0:51:08] <BunnyEmperor> Lmao 3k skill speed sam lets go
[0:51:13] <TheEvilOmega> Bam. First one right in his face.
[0:51:17] <%SilvaChariot0133> Like that?
[0:51:19] <xeros720> this fight is fun as a healer
[0:51:20] <Flyrant> is pat leveling NIN so he can weeb out with Bunshin?
[0:51:20] <+RenoDeGeneric> This boss is a cheatin bitch
[0:51:22] <ittla> no aoe markers
[0:51:28] <%madhattergay> stab his butthole pat
[0:51:29] <ittla> this boss broke the rules
[0:51:29] <Bad1uck> @tasenhall Yes, I play with a controller on PC and it's great. I can lay in bed and grind/run raids
[0:51:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> @mrshazboto VERY ALL the conscious.
[0:51:33] <%AquilaHarukaze> If you use DIversion you tend to not need to
[0:51:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> or stun him Kappa
[0:51:39] <%CitrusDrink> Fun fact! If your tank sucks and dies in 8 seconds, a BRD/MCH can just kite this guy forever to tank it
[0:51:42] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Coincounter is part of the FFXIV tradition of certain types of enemies with untelegraphed movesets like Chimeras and Diresaurs
[0:51:46] <Sydin18> Not Glow-er?
[0:51:48] <%karmatic1110> I did a dungeon for the first time today since Stormblood's release and lets just say that I am a LITTLE terribad atm.
[0:51:52] <ConLin_Arts_> Never really had any need to use Diversion
[0:51:56] <%mrshazboto> @rumtumtugnutz So like WoW, it's always the DPS fault for pulling aggro and not the tanks
[0:52:05] <el_phthalo> Man, I've never seen so many people happy to see Toilet Paper go Kappa
[0:52:07] <%AquilaHarukaze> Remember to count your stuns, you only get 3 before it becomes immune.
[0:52:14] <excedebuster> Learn new things eferyday
[0:52:15] <Jdrockefeller> coin counter is the pubbies intro to no aoe circles and recognizing boss tells
[0:52:16] <+SlowLikeThunder> cyclops only has one eye so he can't read the rulebooks
[0:52:19] <+SlowLikeThunder> thyat's why he cheats
[0:52:21] <CuriousReborn> PogChamp
[0:52:22] <GrandmasterBFunk> thank god the expansion lets you know what can be stunned and what can't
[0:52:23] <%D33TR> if you havent had a good reason to use diversion something is wrong
[0:52:26] <ConLin_Arts_> well yeah, I just now beat the MSQ in ARR
[0:52:28] <%Supertoaster02> it's a godsend for anybody who plays BLM
[0:52:34] <ConLin_Arts_> I'm still a Babby
[0:52:37] <excedebuster> Wow my English is butt
[0:52:38] <%SMT_Izanagi> @AngriestPat You playing XIV for that Moogle tomestone event or just to dick around? I'm saving my time and energy for early access.
[0:52:46] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Remember when SAM needed it constantly?
[0:52:47] <flakari> I've had to use Diversion so much
[0:52:49] <flakari> Dat BLM dps
[0:52:51] <%Divryne> If you don't use Diversion in Savage raids you don't deserve to clear them.
[0:53:00] <Sydin18> Usually casters that do huge burst dmg will need to do it or they will steal all the aggro off the tank, even in their tank stance
[0:53:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> @mrshazboto If your tank knows what they're doing, it's very difficult to pull aggro off them. Not quite as cut-and-dry as WoW, but if you pull aggro off the tank then you're gonna have a bad time.
[0:53:12] <%karmatic1110> Ninja looks like so much fun.
[0:53:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> How long does it usually take to level a class?
[0:53:26] <Flyrant> Ninja is fun once you get used to the Mudras
[0:53:34] <@JustinianKnight> It is my big fav
[0:53:36] <Chinchiillus> Just hit 60 right now with my Ninja. Its super fun :D
[0:53:42] <%Shikari21> @AngriestPat Hey Pat im close to 70 on my main class, and im looking for a new class to level once i get there. whats another good beginner class besides DRG youd suggest
[0:53:42] <DirtyMiser> I wanna see the MCH rework
[0:53:42] <Anubis> as a nin main I cant wait to be the top dog in ShB
[0:53:44] <%nyurgh> cant wait for Shadow Clone
[0:53:46] <jackythefrost> @AngriestPat Will you learn the glory of the highest DPS class in the game BLM?
[0:53:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> On the plus side, adds are usually pretty easy to handle on bosses, so as long as you don't get aggro on the bosses then you can manage pretty well if you're not a twit.
[0:53:48] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat how good is Ninja at AoE?
[0:53:53] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> looking forward to the ShB changes of NIN
[0:53:54] <+Roundelay11> You going to get your lvl 50 ninja set tonight?
[0:53:58] <%EmiinV> ninja is pretty good atm
[0:53:58] <%AncelDeLambert> I see nothing but names, this is like the worst LoL group fight possible
[0:53:59] <tmo200> Is diversion the move that reduces emnity?
[0:54:07] <Sydin18> Summoner
[0:54:09] <%D33TR> red mage is really simple
[0:54:10] <%karmatic1110> I can't wrap my head around the Mudras yet but I'll definitely get around to leveling it
[0:54:10] <Octoppai> I'm so glad my first live Pat stream is Aurum Vale. :' )
[0:54:11] <TheEvilOmega> Has the Bard used Foe's Requiem?
[0:54:12] <flakari> Yep
[0:54:12] <%AquilaHarukaze> I'm going to miss Shadewalker and Smokescreen so bad...
[0:54:15] <Angry_Ev1L> samurai is boring af
[0:54:16] <+TheImmortal70> SMN is about to get SUPER changed
[0:54:16] <%crimsonharvest> Arcanist
[0:54:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> Although with a real good healer it turns out sometimes classes that can't tank can tank.
[0:54:18] <+TheImmortal70> Not a good idea
[0:54:18] <%mishtershmee> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, spending my birthday money to finally sub to you. You're the most glorious piece of shit and I'm okay with that. Much love to you, Paige, and Elmo, go eat a dick and enjoy it.
[0:54:19] <Rhonne> SAM is a good choice, simple and does good DPS
[0:54:21] <+EatinEden> monks do spins and kicks, u gonna play them too
[0:54:23] <flakari> Diversion reduces enmity gain
[0:54:23] <%flying_hipp0> SAM also starts at lvl 50
[0:54:23] <+MisterCrimson> RDM is the easiest
[0:54:25] <%D33TR> do not go whm you'll hate your life
[0:54:26] <%Gogogolem> I'd suggest picking up a tank class so the game will suck your dick all day.
[0:54:27] <%Shikari21> @Sydin18 i was looking at sum
[0:54:29] <Thalchampz> i went from DRG to AST
[0:54:29] <pmtriox> machinist isn't fun but pretty easy
[0:54:31] <%TheAverageSimon> @AngriestPat Gonna stick to DRK? Or thinking about trying Gunbreaker?
[0:54:31] <%SilvaChariot0133> Sam prob easiest melee, but also a meme
[0:54:32] <Jdrockefeller> white mage is a very good to start with healer for the basics
[0:54:32] <%Guardiansaiyan> !uptime
[0:54:33] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 54m 34s.
[0:54:34] <ittla> only cool papas play bard
[0:54:36] <TheEvilOmega> Bard is really easy. Press buttons. Then get to boss and press ALL of the buttons.
[0:54:37] <excedebuster> Is 14 a good starter mmo ? I never played one before
[0:54:37] <Thalchampz> i've been doing okay so far
[0:54:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> Dragoon is the class.
[0:54:38] <%Fidranth> @TheEvilOmega other players dots and other stuff are turned off on pat
[0:54:41] <Daniel_Is_I> @AngriestPat Which DPS class has the fewest buttons? Samurai?
[0:54:42] <KitsuneManami> RDM is easy mode
[0:54:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> Like
[0:54:44] <%mrshazboto> Don't you need to hit 70 before you can get sam?
[0:54:45] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> Red Mage ResidentSleeper
[0:54:46] <Bad1uck> WHM is a nice intro to healing. So many instant heals for when you fuck up
[0:54:48] <GundamF91> I find SAM kinda boring but its relatively easy, so is DRG
[0:54:48] <Jdrockefeller> red mage is a fun and easy mage rotation
[0:54:49] <Flyrant> MCH looks dope in shadowbringers
[0:54:50] <%Shikari21> @rumtumtugnutz My main class is DRG
[0:54:52] <Sydin18> Summoner is usually the best cause u get a TANK pet for when u solo
[0:54:55] <%galaxyswirl> BARD is actually super easy to use
[0:54:56] <%Gogogolem> Wait is gunbreaker a tank?
[0:54:57] <+butch_deadlift> im a beginner and i really like bard
[0:55:01] <%spiritofmojave> RDM is excellent for introing or just playing
[0:55:01] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> @Gogogolem yeah
[0:55:05] <%nyurgh> Yeah Gunbreaker is tank
[0:55:06] <+Kavtech> @Gogogolem Yeah.
[0:55:06] <Jack_Nightshadow> yea, Gunbreaker is a tank.
[0:55:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Shikari21 Me too.
[0:55:07] <%Fidranth> gunbreaker is big tank
[0:55:09] <jackythefrost> @Gogogolem Yes its a tank
[0:55:14] <ConLin_Arts_> welp, gonna sleep, have fun
[0:55:15] <%Gogogolem> Oh well now i am interested in gunbreaker.
[0:55:15] <@CreepyPorpoise> Yeah, Arcanist is good because you get SCH and SMN out of it.
[0:55:15] <%Guardiansaiyan> MARBORO
[0:55:17] <%Guardiansaiyan> Damn
[0:55:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> GOON BROS
[0:55:25] <%karmatic1110> SMN is my main and I am going to level Warrior next. Tanking looks like a blast
[0:55:31] <%Shikari21> Cool ill probas go with with Arcanist for SCH and SMN
[0:55:32] <pmtriox> should have your reset ninjitsu ability too
[0:55:32] <Anubis> @AngriestPat you can cast a doton and hide before the effect actually drops and get another mudra off
[0:55:34] <%Shikari21> Thanks guys
[0:55:36] <@CreepyPorpoise> You can solo duty really easy but also get a healer at 30 for faster queues
[0:55:36] <%Jesseon89> Hey @AngriestPat thanks for mentioning that FFXI was still active on the podcast. I picked that up recently and loving it.
[0:55:52] <revenant4444> @angriestpat do you have any tips for someone who really wants to play Dark Knight but is super nervous about tanking? lol
[0:55:57] <tmo200> Question. Should dps always use aoe skills if against multiple enemies?
[0:56:00] <Zepik> As a healer main trying to learn to tank, I'm finding it tough to trust healing to people that aren't me... feels bad
[0:56:02] <+AllenDeadman> I picked monk because one of my favorite FF characters uses fists
[0:56:03] <BunnyEmperor> Easiest DPS jobs are: Red Mage, Bard, Samurai, Dragoon, and yes in this order.
[0:56:11] <@CreepyPorpoise> @Zepik Same here
[0:56:13] <%Afterman_> GLASS HIM
[0:56:14] <+MisterCrimson> ninergy
[0:56:17] <+alphonseisbest> @angriestpat are their any videos or online guide to the crafting classes that u followed?
[0:56:21] <Flyrant> ninki
[0:56:25] <transporterthesequel> MNK is pretty damn JOHN MADDEN
[0:56:26] <%crimsonharvest> in FF1 the Thief becomes Ninja and that's why, neither one had any actual skills
[0:56:32] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Yeah thats what i don't like abot ninjas is Rogues are way cooler but Japan like jerking themselves off.
[0:56:35] <Bad1uck> @karmatic1110 WAR may be getting screwed in ShB, so I hope you get to enjoy it before the expansion hits
[0:56:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> @tmo200 I'd lean towards no, unless you're in a situation where you HAVE to fight multiple targets. Otherwise single target DPS is better.
[0:56:44] <bestwaifuritsu> @AngriestPat How do I make my number go up as SAM? Im running a 2k+skill speed/2k direct hit materia setup and have only seen 48k crits
[0:56:47] <%spiritofmojave> I always instinctivly move out of the NIN shit
[0:56:51] <BustRobot> Why is the ninja pooping? LUL
[0:56:53] <ittla> @AngriestPat I have all effects on because I'm a casual and I'm here for the art

[0:56:58] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Does each class have a pre-class? I remember from an old podcast/minh that you can actually rock the "pre-class"
[0:57:00] <Sydin18> and ur ninja outfit
[0:57:02] <%Taisuru> ABANDON

[0:57:17] <TheEvilOmega> Death Blossom was a GUILD WARS 1 ASSASSIN MOVE! A good one, too.

[0:57:45] <%Guardiansaiyan> @CreepyPorpoise lol
[0:57:49] <%DXLelouch24> Pat the GRRM Game IS REAL, it just got Leaked
[0:57:50] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Bane_Kaikyo subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[0:57:50] <bestwaifuritsu> death blossom was the super move from The Last Starfighter and it was awesome
[0:57:56] <+TheImmortal70> Gotta prevent people from being idiots and using Lancer instead of DRG
[0:57:56] <%DXLelouch24> Were Never Getting The Books
[0:57:57] <%DXLelouch24> EVER
[0:57:58] <%weissguard> @CreepyPorpoise When you put it that way... LUL
[0:58:00] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Bane_Kaikyo congrats!
[0:58:02] <%snow_bush> @Guardiansaiyan The Village Hidden in the Can?
[0:58:02] <%crimsonharvest> The original intent was to be like in FF1 or FF3 where you unlocked advanced versions of your class
[0:58:04] <Flyrant> he used it on earlier fights
[0:58:04] <+MisterCrimson> you also used to have to level two classes to unlock a job
[0:58:05] <Zepik> but if you have a job, you don't need to go to class
[0:58:05] <%D33TR> death blossom was also the mode Enzo puts his gun in in Reboot
[0:58:08] <%EmiinV> why not use it on this boss which is single target
[0:58:17] <%EmiinV> rangel2Peek
[0:58:17] <切捨御免> damage is in bursts not a dot
[0:58:19] <%Guardiansaiyan> @snow_bush Village hidden in the coaine...or denial
[0:58:20] <Jack_Nightshadow> The fruit doesn't respawn
[0:58:22] <%TheAverageSimon> Bad Breath man
[0:58:23] <Soulsbjorne> did he say he doesnt use TA
[0:58:24] <%ozmodek> @angriestpat It just leaked that FROM and GRRM's game is called Elden Rings
[0:58:24] <BustRobot> Nobody expects the super tall and large ninja which makes him the perfect ninja!
[0:58:26] <jackythefrost> @42nfl19 You gain no benefits from only playing the class, you should upgrade to your job ASAP
[0:58:26] <+TheImmortal70> The fruit absolutely respawns
[0:58:35] <pmtriox> as i said, just didn't see you use it
[0:58:36] <+makeshiftlurch> they went all out with dungeon design for this one
[0:58:37] <@CreepyPorpoise> @MisterCrimson You don't actually need to do that anymore, they removed it with Stormblood I believe
[0:58:38] <ittla> vale really isnt complicated or tough
[0:58:38] <TheEvilOmega> Man, I want to unlock Ninja now because of fond memories of my Guild Wars character.
[0:58:40] <%AuksMattin> AuksMattin converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[0:58:43] <Sydin18> Nah, they got married

[0:59:17] <%spiritofmojave> oh that's some jank LUL
[0:59:18] <BunnyEmperor> Pat thats not the WHM ability
[0:59:18] <NumbusPlays> @TheEvilOmega For real, Guild Wars was really cool. I wish more games had stuff like Mesmers, Assassins, or Paragons
[0:59:21] <SweetCuppingCake> report them for haaacks
[0:59:25] <Thalchampz> you can go for 3 here
[0:59:26] <BustRobot> Red Bull gave WHM wings! LUL
[0:59:29] <TheEvilOmega> Wait, Pat, if White Mages get wings, does that mean
[0:59:30] <bestwaifuritsu> Buy the Terraflare emote and troll everyone LUL
[0:59:31] <%SilvaChariot0133> 3-4 yeah
[0:59:35] <TheEvilOmega> Dang it, Bust. Dang it all.
[0:59:35] <Animal_Farm4> @AngriestPat do you understand how Eureka works and if so can you explain it? I'm kind of confused having just unlocked it
[0:59:44] <Flyrant> fuckin blew it
[0:59:44] <TheEvilOmega> I was going to make that joke!
[0:59:47] <%spiritofmojave> @bestwaifuritsu lmao
[0:59:49] <$Valdorick> Shamefur Dispray
[0:59:51] <Jdrockefeller> eurkea is *** MMO land
[0:59:53] <haveswordmuststing> @theevilomega Woolie's cool angel drawings have come to life
[0:59:56] <CuriousReborn> NotLikeThis
[0:59:56] <TheEvilOmega> Uuuugh, Mesmers. Those make me cry.
[0:59:57] <DirtyMiser> PotD is just going to be dancers
[0:59:57] <Jdrockefeller> old school
[1:00:00] <NumbusPlays> oh no, the houtons
[1:00:01] <krymzen5> big dumb
[1:00:02] <+Ryuutennou> Horton hears a Huton?
[1:00:03] <%D33TR> eureka is basically FF11
[1:00:04] <Shotred> makes want to go an finish my samurai/monk character I still in the dragon expansion
[1:00:08] <ilasper1> the futon?
[1:00:12] <Bad1uck> @TheEvilOmega @NumbusPlays I wish more games had classes like Engineer. Those kits were so damned good
[1:00:14] <pmtriox> all speed all the time
[1:00:17] <DirtyMiser> Oops I mean Heaven on high
[1:00:21] <ittla> if you like managing that hotbar, try playing bard!!!
[1:00:21] <%CitrusDrink> Putty you gotta eat a fruit!
[1:00:22] <jackythefrost> @Animal_Farm4 Eureka is meant to be like an old school MMO but they fucked up hard. Plus its too late to get the gear from it now
[1:00:24] <RadShiro> when you play ninja you ALWAYS HITTING BUTTONS
[1:00:26] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> I'm disappointed I've never seen a Nin named Tim Huutons
[1:00:27] <%Taisuru> Pinwheel not ninja star
[1:00:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> Eureka is awful. it's a cool idea with a terrible execution.
[1:00:33] <NumbusPlays> I will never stop complaining about Paragons not coming back in GW2
[1:00:34] <Jdrockefeller> you go in and manually form parties to fight monsters to gain levels for an elemental exp system
[1:00:35] <Flyrant> Keeping up Huton before armor crush :(
[1:00:35] <krymzen5> ninjas the fun stuff if u wanna hit buttons
[1:00:41] <%TheAverageSimon> I'd say Ninja is a good middle class that isn't too complicated, but not too simple either
[1:00:48] <%Kouseo> Kouseo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! i keep trying to get back into ffxiv but im too lazy to get back to cap lvl
[1:00:51] <%SilvaChariot0133> RIP Trick
[1:01:00] <Kaede_Viz> this parse going to fflogs?
[1:01:04] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat you can separate buffs and debuffs, and resize and move them to make them more visable
[1:01:05] <TheEvilOmega> I gave up on GW2 at, like, level 30 because I was bored to tears from it.
[1:01:07] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Is Elmo a picky eater?
[1:01:10] <+SickBangerzM9> Is FFXIV more of a story mmo or a late game grindy mmo?
[1:01:10] <garbageheaphound> How do you do Limit Break?
[1:01:12] <Jdrockefeller> you grind through four different lands for a storyline and relic equipment for you grind option for gear
[1:01:15] <jackythefrost> Is BLM is the most fun DPS for me
[1:01:16] <bestwaifuritsu> story MMO
[1:01:19] <%D33TR> its alll story
[1:01:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> Eureka is basically you queing into a completely different MMO.
[1:01:20] <+MisterCrimson> push the LB button
[1:01:20] <%Ner234> What is the most technical/complicated class?
[1:01:25] <Jdrockefeller> it's very much story
[1:01:26] <Latija> Cannabis Bill
[1:01:26] <%BlitzNeidhart> @garbageheaphound Press the LB button
[1:01:27] <Luish_GO> 6 stacks NotLikeThis
[1:01:27] <Sydin18> tiny axe
[1:01:31] <Bad1uck> @SickBangerzM9 Story for sure
[1:01:31] <revenant4444> @angriestpat do you have any tips for someone that wants to plat Dark Knight but is nervous about tanking?
[1:01:34] <Jdrockefeller> but there is fun end game
[1:01:34] <+TheImmortal70> Most technical is probably.... Monk?
[1:01:34] <solar_pinnacle> thanks pat?
[1:01:35] <%budyd> It's a billhook
[1:01:40] <BunnyEmperor> Monk is the most technical and complicated job
[1:01:41] <IndoorSitup> Anyone else trying to cope with how badly SCH is about to be shafted and how boring it'll be to play?
[1:01:41] <CountMeowingtonn> !uptime
[1:01:41] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 1m.
[1:01:43] <+Roundelay11> Do your class quest
[1:01:44] <pmtriox> its an ice hook
[1:01:52] <BustRobot> @SickBangerzM9 Very much a story MMO, the end game grindy stuff is generally optional
[1:01:54] <Shotred> I rather have a challenging game with story compsre to a grind fest
[1:01:55] <$Valdorick> Just do
[1:01:56] <jackythefrost> @SickBangerzM9 14 is a story MMO. You have to do the main story to unlock pretty much everything
[1:01:56] <CountMeowingtonn> oh good, in time for pat to stop the shout outs Kappa
[1:01:57] <+SeaBassTheLad> just tank 4Head
[1:01:58] <+MisterCrimson> I hate billhooks and Bhujes aesthetically
[1:01:58] <Bielzitcho> turn on mount bgm
[1:01:59] <NoirePanzer> Just go in. Tanking will only stop the anxienty
[1:01:59] <Flyrant> what's the fastest way to level another class to 70?
[1:02:00] <+RubADubDucky> NINs level 50 quest is cool
[1:02:06] <ittla> PSA: tanking is fun because you get to be the main character
[1:02:07] <californaya> Fake it til you make it
[1:02:09] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat you can separate buffs and debuffs, and resize and move them to make them more visable
[1:02:09] <KitsuneManami> Its Fun, Enjoy
[1:02:11] <Jdrockefeller> PLD and war are good intros to tanking
[1:02:11] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> it's actually kinda rad
[1:02:17] <CountMeowingtonn> D:
[1:02:19] <%kujofire990> belive it
[1:02:19] <%D33TR> disgusting
[1:02:19] <%Nikopol1717> Palace will let you get used to the class
[1:02:20] <%CitrusDrink> Pat is gonna unlock his secret bloodline technique
[1:02:20] <Octoppai> sHOW ME THE NINJA.
[1:02:21] <+SickBangerzM9> So there is any decent replay value after the story is done?
[1:02:21] <Bielzitcho> thank you
[1:02:24] <%Mythicalbrit> @revenant4444 adopt the mental thought of "fuck these people I'mma learn"
[1:02:24] <krymzen5> when bots are added, tanking will be easier to grasp since u can use them to train
[1:02:26] <Thalchampz> SourPls
[1:02:27] <+reiju_22> wtf
[1:02:29] <+SweepTheLegoMyEggo> @AngriestPat Did you see the E3 game leaks?
[1:02:29] <Soulsbjorne> noooooooo
[1:02:32] <Ion_Laser> riffOMG
[1:02:32] <jackythefrost> @AngriestPat I just finished the BLM Quests. Shantotto references everywhere
[1:02:32] <ChronosScion> I love the ninja antagonist
[1:02:34] <GundamF91> you wont get past tank anxiety unless u actually tank, thts the whole ass truth
[1:02:35] <%mayorrev> vroom vroom
[1:02:38] <gustavozxd> YEEEEE
[1:02:39] <%weissguard> SourPls
[1:02:41] <Jdrockefeller> there are storylines for all classes
[1:02:41] <Shotred> I take Pat bought that car mount lol
[1:02:42] <californaya> god, that's the stupidest thing
[1:02:42] <%Shady_Squid> hereinmycar.mp3
[1:02:42] <%mayorrev> That car looks so stupid
[1:02:45] <A_Red_Robot> The car was a mistake
[1:02:46] <Futurecity10> Is the final fantasy 13-2 choka bitch song in this game?
[1:02:46] <CountMeowingtonn> @SickBangerzM9 MMO with replay value? what? lmao
[1:02:47] <Zepik> what helped me was running dungeons with the npc squadrons and then running dungeons I actually know really well with players. I ran Qarn a whole bunch leveling my DRK
[1:02:49] <BustRobot> @revenant4444 I pretty much only done tank in FFXIV, they best thing you can do is just start and practice. Once you learn it tanking is actually fairly simple.
[1:02:50] <%D33TR> the car mount was an in game event
[1:02:51] <%thelaxinator> does it really play "A quick pitstop" when in town?
[1:02:57] <Jdrockefeller> and all crafters and gatherers too
[1:02:57] <%Gogogolem> Advice for tanking fuck the dps and keep the heal slut alive.
[1:02:59] <%ArcanumMBD> The car is the single best mount in FF14, fuck the haters
[1:03:01] <+guyalex> anyone know a good server? just come back after a few years and I'm thinking of moving to find a good fc
[1:03:04] <Jdrockefeller> that's the mount music
[1:03:05] <TheEvilOmega> I was always super worried about being a Healer, thought I'd be terrible, but after doing it, I've found it can be pretty fun.
[1:03:08] <%Guardiansaiyan> SO much CLIPPING
[1:03:08] <Bad1uck> @revenant4444 I used to have tanking anxiety too. Just make sure you know how to play your class, then stop giving a fuck about others
[1:03:08] <%Kuro_Koshka> Pat didn't fuck up wooooo
[1:03:09] <%TheAverageSimon> @AngriestPat What is your favorite Job/Class story line?
[1:03:09] <revenant4444> @mythicalbrit ive seen people say that other places lol
[1:03:09] <Flyrant> the car is putrid ass
[1:03:17] <%mayorrev> why is he in a car
[1:03:19] <+SickBangerzM9> @CountMeowingtonn i meant worthwhile endgame content. farming for high level gear
[1:03:22] <jackythefrost> Heavensward is the best part of the story by far
[1:03:24] <BunnyEmperor> this car looks like shit, but i still got it because im a filthy collector
[1:03:27] <Shotred> I whu
[1:03:29] <%Guardiansaiyan> @mayorrev cause he actually has a liscense
[1:03:30] <Flyrant> you are
[1:03:30] <bestwaifuritsu> @AngriestPat Youre on Ultros right? I wanna get a screenie of you lol
[1:03:31] <+GloomSpringer> @mayorrev its the car from that one game
[1:03:33] <Tucker0603> PLD ftw
[1:03:34] <+TheImmortal70> The thing about tanking is that so long as you do Aggro grab>Aoe>Aoe, anything you do after for the majority of dungeons can't possibly be "wrong" so long as you don't drop aggro
[1:03:35] <gustavozxd> why do people hate the car
[1:03:35] <Jdrockefeller> ffxv cross over event
[1:03:36] <%CitrusDrink> The best mount is Cloud's bike. I spent real world money to get it for my anime catgirl because I'm cool as fuck
[1:03:36] <RupanSen> the car looks like a badly made mod
[1:03:51] <%Kaask> Kaask subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Here's a free sub I forgot about.
[1:03:52] <Shotred> I wish there where flying mounts or a motorcycle one
[1:03:52] <TheEvilOmega> I finally got my Pegasus today!
[1:03:53] <Jdrockefeller> car is a four person mount it rules

[1:04:03] <$Valdorick> Saul Heavensward
[1:04:07] <BustRobot> Yeah tanking only gets even mildly complicated in the end level Savage dungeons, I've found
[1:04:12] <Octoppai> Oh my god its Sans Heavensward.

[1:04:25] <%All_Salt> @angriestpat Do you prioritize DoT skills(longest or shortest first) or right now damage.
[1:04:26] <Octoppai> Oh yeah, that shit is the greatest.
[1:04:27] <%thelaxinator> We really were the final fantasy 14
[1:04:27] <%Shikari21> ITS SO COOL
[1:04:29] <%arcaderabbit48> I cant wait to see why the final quest is called Shadowbringers
[1:04:30] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> We truly were the Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood
[1:04:31] <$Valdorick> I'm just doing my job, sir, I'm... a Family Guy..
[1:04:33] <%spiritofmojave> We really truly were a SHADOWBRINGERS

[1:04:52] <SomersaultJustice> we truly are the final fantasy xiv shadowbringers
[1:04:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> The true Shadowbringers were the friends we made along the way.
[1:04:52] <KVD22> at last we truly weren't super best friends
[1:04:54] <%BlitzNeidhart> I clapped when I read the quest name!
[1:04:59] <RupanSen> like when they say Naruto in Naruto
[1:05:00] <jackythefrost> Final Steps of Faith
[1:05:01] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@BustRobot) (warning)
[1:05:01] <masso101> So what there’s a quest called 2.3?
[1:05:05] <+KoyaMusa> i also adore the breaking boundaries is in most of the final job quests

[1:05:27] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat dont forget to get the Dyeable ver
[1:05:29] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Flyrant 5th arc, 3rd season
[1:05:29] <pmtriox> 50-60 you're hired by a princess
[1:05:32] <+KaiIzuki> What datacenter did you end up on after the split??
[1:05:33] <%arcaderabbit48> Oboro is really cute though! Like, he's an idiot, but he's a cute idiot
[1:05:35] <CountMeowingtonn> cool ninja shit is going commando Kreygasm
[1:05:40] <Octoppai> I want this cool ninja bullshit. *DEPOSITS PANTS INTO THE VOID.*
[1:05:41] <Calern> roegadyn rulez
[1:05:42] <+HelloImTom08> Ninja is gonna be fucking crazy in SHB
[1:05:42] <%Guardiansaiyan> GET THE LOCKER @AngriestPat
[1:05:52] <Zepik> The DRK job quests at 50 get so anime it was pretty hype as fuck
[1:05:53] <CountMeowingtonn> Ninja is the superior weeb job
[1:06:02] <$Valdorick> You've unlocked the Date with him!?
[1:06:04] <krymzen5> agreed
[1:06:10] <+MisterCrimson> The level 70 quest for Warriros is about how the power of love conquers even the most powerful enemies....I'm not joking
[1:06:11] <%Fidranth> DRK knight level 50 is the best class quest in the game
[1:06:26] <Flyrant> still need to level DRK
[1:06:27] <%Owkono> Owkono subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 12 month streak! I love ff14 as well
[1:06:30] <%Fidranth> disclaimer: I haven't finished them all
[1:06:31] <+Kavtech> Ninjas usually resort to grenades and explosives.
[1:06:34] <%spiritofmojave> Oboro is a simple boy
[1:06:36] <BustRobot> @revenant4444 Personally, FFXIV is the one MMO I've found where saltiness is kinda rare. When I do a dungeon / raid for first time I'll usually just tell the others it's my first time on said dungeon / raid and ask for advice. (Checking guides before your first run also helps)
[1:06:36] <%arcaderabbit48> @MisterCrimson The Inner Beast in Heat?
[1:06:39] <CountMeowingtonn> "so that's it huh, we're some kind of shadowbringers"
[1:06:44] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat What class quest is the coolest, BESIDES DRK
[1:06:45] <LongLivetheEmpire> Ninja is an aweomely complicated job, its based on priority, making decisions mid fight constantly \o/
[1:06:49] <%salty_syd913> stick to the rivers and lakes that your used to
[1:06:50] <haveswordmuststing> ninjas also briefly had guns IIRC
[1:06:59] <+GrimmSquirrelGaming> just stick with the river snad the lakes you are use to?
[1:07:00] <jackythefrost> @AngriestPat If you hate Lalafells what is your opinion on the Tataru's from XI
[1:07:01] <Flyrant> yeah Ninja constantly keeps you engaged
[1:07:02] <CountMeowingtonn> Ninjas do naruto hand signs and that's all you need to know
[1:07:02] <%arcaderabbit48> @CountMeowingtonn Yes, actually! We are explicitly that!
[1:07:06] <%kujofire990> hit apatBig Credits for 2.0
[1:07:08] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> FFXIV had the good idea of rewarding the party if there's a player who's doing an instance for their first time
[1:07:10] <bestwaifuritsu> I SEE YOU PAT.
[1:07:11] <%CitrusDrink> BRD has the worst quests it's a shame :(
[1:07:13] <%Finaldragoon> Pat's right
[1:07:14] <CapeJapes> SCH quests are fantastic
[1:07:14] <+Arnschen> Lol, the boss music kicking in
[1:07:14] <krymzen5> it's like the rushdown version of an mmo and it's dope
[1:07:14] <+VariantX7> At some point I will renew my sub to this game...I just have to be willing to play nothing else but this game though lol
[1:07:17] <%HajimenoStream> warrior quest lines
[1:07:18] <BunnyEmperor> Yeah I was about to say, Summoner has a dope final quest
[1:07:19] <BustRobot> Truly I have become... THE SHADOWBRINGER
[1:07:19] <arknodem> SCH is pretty good.
[1:07:20] <%HajimenoStream> curious gorge
[1:07:22] <SomersaultJustice> eh
[1:07:22] <%HajimenoStream> :3c
[1:07:23] <%Fidranth> @KitsuneManami SAM is also cool
[1:07:24] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> @AngriestPat it's Upper actually
[1:07:24] <%Ner234> What's your favorite mount Pat?
[1:07:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> I liked the Dragoon job quest.
[1:07:33] <+Arnschen> Yeah, the SMN one is great
[1:07:33] <Bad1uck> I'm sorry, I could have sworn you meant to say WARRIOR
[1:07:36] <Shotred> @bustrobot I agree Never had problems with people unless you doing a dungeon wrong
[1:07:39] <KVD22> asians?
[1:07:42] <Flyrant> PLD was alright
[1:07:42] <Jdrockefeller> sch is fun too
[1:07:44] <Dwarven_Gaming> too bad theres only one this expansion coming
[1:07:44] <jackythefrost> Acians
[1:07:47] <+plasticss> ASSicans
[1:07:47] <%arcaderabbit48> Stormblood's really dropped the ball, sadly
[1:07:47] <%HajimenoStream> you get to fight asians
[1:07:48] <CountMeowingtonn> why is your mount music so fucking hype lmao
[1:07:48] <+KoyaMusa> fools falls is in eastern
[1:07:49] <BunnyEmperor> Also the summoner quest line has cool solo dungeons / locations
[1:07:49] <%HajimenoStream> nice
[1:07:52] <%Finaldragoon> Summoner Stormblood story has you deal with Allagan tech
[1:07:54] <%Swampykins> Yeah, SCH is also enjoyable.
[1:07:56] <revenant4444> @bustrobot Cool, ill look into some guides, would you reccomend Warrior or Paladin? I kinda like the look of Warrior more haha idk if one is easier than the other
[1:07:58] <Texeu> I frigging love that mounts song. Just need to get it myself at some point.
[1:07:58] <arknodem> PLD's tournament arc was alright.
[1:07:59] <+MisterRockett> it's boss tracks!
[1:08:00] <bestwaifuritsu> Lmao I see myself on stream now
[1:08:01] <Tucker0603> PLD is solid but needs some work
[1:08:02] <%CitrusDrink> The best class questline is the Heavensward Botanist one where you solve that mystery about the cabbages
[1:08:02] <Jdrockefeller> sch quest line has tonberries
[1:08:06] <KitsuneManami> I liked SAM a lot.
[1:08:08] <CountMeowingtonn> what doggo mount is that chat?
[1:08:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> @revenant4444 Warrior is easier.
[1:08:14] <Commander_Spyke> None of Paladin's story lines are good until the 70 questline
[1:08:15] <TheEvilOmega> I bet Bard's story quest is lame. Because it was lame in ARR.
[1:08:17] <jackythefrost> PLD gets a fucking anime tournament arc
[1:08:18] <Flyrant> hey it's that dog
[1:08:18] <+plasticss> suzaku mount music is the best
[1:08:21] <Jdrockefeller> that's shinryu pupper
[1:08:24] <arknodem> Shinryu I think
[1:08:25] <Lotharman> FF14 again here? Awesome!
[1:08:27] <+GrimmSquirrelGaming> creepo!
[1:08:29] <+MisterRockett> Hey Pat do you know the trick to memorizing your Justus?
[1:08:30] <Daniel_Is_I> @AngriestPat Hey Pat when does my character stop looking hideous? I'm level 42 and he's got serious Burning Crusade leveling gear syndrome.
[1:08:31] <+KoyaMusa> oh look one of pats many orbiters
[1:08:37] <%Guardiansaiyan> You will NEVER escape the creepos!
[1:08:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> I haven't done PLD yet but Warrior is easier for tanking.
[1:08:38] <%Ner234> That's cool
[1:08:38] <+Dredgen_Wafflez> Shinryu music on a nice sunday stroll
[1:08:43] <%Finaldragoon> 1
[1:08:44] <Commander_Spyke> I really wish you didn't have to move to hear the music, kills it for me
[1:08:44] <$Valdorick> Sundowning Kappa
[1:08:45] <+BHPicasso> ass whole
[1:08:47] <Bad1uck> @revenant4444 WAR is more flexible and less survivable than PLD
[1:08:48] <Jdrockefeller> level 50 you unlock glamours in more dhona
[1:08:51] <IndoorSitup> Anyone else trying to cope with how badly SCH is about to be shafted and how boring it'll be to play?
[1:08:52] <%yeknomlive> i always get chills at the main theme motif
[1:08:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> WHOLE ASS
[1:08:54] <%mayorrev> @AngriestPat why is there a flying motorcycle in this game
[1:09:01] <grayjammer> NO WAY
[1:09:01] <+dasmause> tsukuyomi phase 3 music is the best trial song in stormblood, maybe ever
[1:09:04] <krymzen5> do people just creepily stalk pat in 14?
[1:09:05] <%DarkwolfWeyr> DarkwolfWeyr subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[1:09:07] <Jdrockefeller> and then you get into the real end game, dress up
[1:09:08] <KitsuneManami> Does Suzaku have a Doge Mount?

[1:09:58] <BustRobot> @revenant4444 I've never done Warrior myself but I have Paladin. Paladin is very tanky and in dungeons / raids is usually the off-tank (i.e. the tank that grabs the adds). Warriors usually take the main tank roll for pulling the boss. Paladin is very simple to learn.

[1:10:31] <Macmo696> It’s this is Halloween
[1:10:32] <%weissguard> It's legally distinct. Whatchu talkin' bout'?
[1:10:32] <%spiritofmojave> Big fucking lawsuit
[1:10:34] <@JustinianKnight> but it's also just the Moogle theme
[1:10:34] <%CitrusDrink> It's pretty halloweeny
[1:10:35] <pectusumbra> is just a crime
[1:10:35] <%PROUD2beGINGER> When was Kingdom Hearts released
[1:10:35] <CountMeowingtonn> @AngriestPat You can't just show something that cool and not tell us how to get it
[1:10:36] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat What Primal is your favorite OST? and why is it not Sephirot or Suzaku
[1:10:36] <@CreepyPorpoise> I've been saying that since Moogle Mog released XD
[1:10:38] <Mastigias> "I've never saw Twin Peaks"
[1:10:39] <%weissguard> Kappa
[1:10:40] <+binkarus> THIS IS HAROWEEN
[1:10:40] <Macmo696> That’s pretty blatant
[1:10:41] <@JustinianKnight> which might be older than that
[1:10:41] <%crimsonharvest> I am the man with the tearaway face
[1:10:42] <Commander_Spyke> Ride on Sephirot's mount for powerman wixMini
[1:10:42] <thewhiterice92> Oh for sure
[1:10:42] <AdmiralButtloaf> it's a homage
[1:10:44] <Jdrockefeller> the base melody is the ff6 mog theme though
[1:10:44] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> @AngriestPat Apparently people who made "this is halloween" helped with the song
[1:10:45] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Moogles scream in the dead of night
[1:10:46] <gekizenbu> This game has a lot of legally distinct, Sephirot's
[1:10:46] <A_Red_Robot> What do you mean? Soken never heard of Powerman 5000 before
[1:10:47] <%Nobrev> this is the other bit of "obviously stolen music" in this game
[1:10:50] <%weissguard> Sorry, forgot Kappa.
[1:10:52] <MetelStar> It's got that Tim Burton tune, but that's about it
[1:10:52] <revenant4444> @rumtumtugnutz @bad1uck Cool I'll prob check out Warrior then!
[1:10:52] <CapeJapes> Sephirots theme was pretty much any powerman insertnumber song
[1:10:53] <%Finaldragoon> just like how Sephirot's theme is legally distinct from Powerman 5000
[1:10:54] <Flyrant> kingdom hearts cross over confirmed
[1:10:55] <%weissguard> **** Kappa
[1:10:57] <masso101> What are you talking about? It’s fine
[1:11:00] <ricotez> sephirot's song sounds a lot like a thing too
[1:11:00] <jackythefrost> Sophia has the best primal theme
[1:11:04] <haveswordmuststing> NNNOOOOO, really, i havent noticed Kappa
[1:11:06] <%Owkono> Legally distinct, kupo

[1:11:55] <Bad1uck> Okay
[1:11:55] <+JavaManJoJo> @AngriestPat With a game like this we get to have all the stupid podcasty type nonsense without the gameplay distracting you as much
[1:11:56] <%Verd_254> well hey, top ffxiv stream right now
[1:11:57] <suikudo> @AngriestPat You ever do any pvp?
[1:11:58] <%around_40_jobbers> but that would be -C R A Z Y T A L K-
[1:11:58] <%mayorrev> awoooooo
[1:11:58] <xAlcaidx> It's honestly kinda surprising considering it's the dead time between expansions
[1:11:59] <%Iccirrus> I couldn't care less about MMOs for the most part, but you're entertaining so it's all good
[1:12:00] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> deeper
[1:12:02] <CountMeowingtonn> Pat is a ff14 streamer now Pog

[1:12:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ugh, no
[1:12:25] <+Darren716> Yeah who'd do that, sounds like a leap of fate
[1:12:27] <AMajorTom> You played Pillars for like 10 hrs at a time, Who's going to watch that?
[1:12:28] <Jdrockefeller> yeah that's the point
[1:12:28] <Wigglebottom_> happened to me with borderlands 2 DansGame
[1:12:29] <BustRobot> There's an ache in my butt. It's an achy ache. An achy ache that aches
[1:12:30] <%weissguard> ??

[1:12:45] <+SlowLikeThunder> Do you do your hunting logs for EXP? It seems like it was useful early levels but I don't know if it scales well @AngriestPat
[1:12:46] <TheEvilOmega> He's a butthead fate boss that got in my way for the quest I had.
[1:12:46] <%Unlimited_> I fought that stupid thing
[1:12:47] <Flyrant> hey are we getting a phial of fantasia with ShadowBringers?

[1:13:21] <%Guardiansaiyan> PrideParty PrideSaba
[1:13:21] <+dasmause> oh right youre doing the jojo quests
[1:13:32] <GypsySquid> Sure is shonen anime in here.

[1:13:47] <%Fidranth> This is why I fight
[1:13:50] <%PROUD2beGINGER> This is like a Yakuza sad moment
[1:13:52] <DjFrostBite95> Big sad
[1:13:56] <%spiritofmojave> Big sad arc
[1:13:58] <MetelStar> Doubts goes up
[1:14:01] <+Artimadare> But Riku, the darkness
[1:14:01] <bestwaifuritsu> Surprise for Pat when he gets outta this cutscene
[1:14:16] <+dasmause> TIME BUBBLE
[1:14:16] <+Arnschen> Don't think about it
[1:14:19] <@mothmandraws> how big spoils is stream gonna be
[1:14:19] <LongLivetheEmpire> It takes place in the past
[1:14:21] <reonome> BAMF
[1:14:23] <MetelStar> Time travel Pat. Just think time travel
[1:14:23] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Kiriyu is sad
[1:14:23] <%Ilpala> pff do the dragoon one! IT HAS ESTINIEN!
[1:14:24] <BustRobot> NINJA VANISH
[1:14:28] <%CitrusDrink> He exploded into flour
[1:14:28] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Nobody told him yet Pat.
[1:14:28] <alwayspronking> Time is convoluted in FF XIV
[1:14:29] <Flyrant> TIME PARADOX
[1:14:30] <+KoyaMusa> all job quests exist only in the time when they were released
[1:14:34] <Bad1uck> @AngriestPat You didn't liberate the Doma in his heart though
[1:14:34] <GypsySquid> Neither does Dragoon's if you did your road trip with Estinien already.
[1:14:35] <guppy_> shes literally creeping in the bushes
[1:14:37] <%weissguard> *POOF*
[1:14:37] <%shadybarman> he's gonna go build a Doat castle
[1:14:38] <@JustinianKnight> it's technically in the past
[1:14:51] <krymzen5> that sounds VERY spoil
[1:14:53] <Jdrockefeller> technically this doesn't need to be a time bubble. there could be plenty of ninjas who defected on their own will
[1:14:54] <+MisterRockett> No Pat! You haven't done that yet!
[1:14:56] <$OranHexthief> you mean like going through all the ishguard stuff where they don't believe you despite being officially recognized as the azure dragoon LUL
[1:15:00] <%Lunchbox5353> Lunchbox5353 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:15:02] <Mastigias> lewd
[1:15:02] <Zepik> if you get Castrum basically nothing happens
[1:15:03] <haveswordmuststing> shhhh, new expansion shit doesnt apply to these
[1:15:09] <@CreepyPorpoise> Pat please do not play with your balls on stream :C
[1:15:12] <%TheAverageSimon> They actually update certain dialogue when you're at a certain point in the MSQ when you do old job/class content
[1:15:14] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Man, you think this questline is outdated? Go play the Dragoon ones! Holy shit, the foreshadowing for Heavensward was absurd and has aged poorly!
[1:15:14] <@mothmandraws> ill tab out there
[1:15:16] <Flyrant> ugh the Praetorium unskipable cutscenes
[1:15:16] <%flying_hipp0> good ting i;m too stupid to remeber
[1:15:23] <irontatsumi> can that annoying stalker go away
[1:15:24] <GypsySquid> By believing in his friiiiieeeeends!!
[1:15:26] <BustRobot> Secret... Ninja man~
[1:15:27] <masso101> Hey this isn’t necessarily a knock against woolie or anything, but I don’t understand his inability to understand anything that he has no experience in. Like I understand he doesn’t play mmos, he doesn’t like rpgs, but the concepts put forth in your discussions aren’t that hard to understand that he needs to “convert it to fun” as he puts it.
[1:15:28] <Nineball_Luce> Helping other Ninja men is my Ninja Way
[1:15:37] <+davos_southway> Hey pat any plans to stream Baldur's Gate 3?
[1:15:39] <Jdrockefeller> yeah there are sometimes call backs in different class and job stuff
[1:15:43] <%Fidranth> @AngriestPat biggest, most hilarious anachronism is doing the elvel 50 culinarian quest after shit goes down in 2.5
[1:15:43] <krymzen5> yeah, my memories too shit for it to matter tbh
[1:15:45] <haitahaita> hey lads, I've been looking for a FC in Behemoth, I'd like to raid and I'm mostly a healer =\
[1:15:46] <haveswordmuststing> they brought back the Moogle merchant so we can suffer before SB
[1:15:47] <@mothmandraws> I gotta fight tidus tommorow
[1:15:47] <%spiritofmojave> I had to grind that out forever for Pegasus
[1:15:49] <CountMeowingtonn> my favorite part about that dungeon is all the goobers in the background while your big dick energy is all over the story scenes
[1:15:49] <%EmiinV> lemme tell ya this is interesting to have on in the background while my wife gives my computer very confusing looks
[1:15:51] <Basch71> I practically sleep tanking MSQ roulette
[1:15:53] <Lotharman> All that Hunting Log ignored
[1:15:53] <TheEvilOmega> Praetorium is an hour of your life and you have to hear the phrase "must needs" like four times.
[1:15:54] <Jdrockefeller> so playing everything does give Easter egg dialogue
[1:15:59] <@mothmandraws> busy finding costa de sols lunch though atm
[1:16:01] <+ShudMirelurk> LUL fair
[1:16:01] <%WackyGear> never giving up is my nindo! - Pat
[1:16:07] <@mothmandraws> pre titan is wierd

[1:22:32] <%weissguard> Ahhh.
[1:22:32] <+Kavtech> That's alright then.
[1:22:32] <Mastigias> pretty good reason
[1:22:33] <%TheAverageSimon> That's a solid reason
[1:22:35] <Octoppai> Yotsuyu said she'd step on my f-- YES.

[1:22:38] <%Fidranth> "doma fuckin sucks bruv"
[1:22:39] <BustRobot> I would let Yotsuyu step on my person Kreygasm
[1:22:39] <jackythefrost> I want Yotsuyu to step on me alright
[1:22:41] <%BlitzNeidhart> Compelling argument
[1:22:43] <AzureFlame98> You think this is a joke but this narration is actually 100% Factually Accurate
[1:22:44] <%AquilaHarukaze> Can't beat that hime cut
[1:22:45] <%Destructive_Forces> ID Tagged Ninjas, using ID tagged shuriken, wearing ID tagged armor...
[1:22:49] <%MagickBurritoh> PARAGRAPH
[1:22:52] <CountMeowingtonn> GREEDY
[1:22:54] <Shotred> Let Them Ninja Fight !!!!
[1:22:55] <+Kavtech> YEAH IT WAS
[1:22:55] <Mastigias> "yea"
[1:22:56] <krymzen5> words that kill

[1:23:08] <MonstarGrrrl> yuk yuk yuk
[1:23:10] <Octoppai> "People die if they're killed!"
[1:23:15] <+AllenDeadman> xigbar aged quite a bit here Kappa
[1:23:20] <bestwaifuritsu> You called me a weirdo, I will have my revenge Pat.
[1:23:20] <%Destructive_Forces> All for revenge
[1:23:20] <+Roundelay11> Yugiri could kick both of these motherfuckers asses
[1:23:21] <%CitrusDrink> Only a clown would get revenge against me
[1:23:22] <+terranfirma> "Yeah people died, but NINJAS"
[1:23:23] <Bad1uck> @krymzen5 So FF14 was a complete mess when it launched at version 1. The head producer stepped down and it was so bad most companies would have just set fire to it and walked away
[1:23:25] <%Hallommig> jobber ninjas!
[1:23:27] <%weissguard> Maaaaaan, it's weird hearing character names when I basically know them as cards from the FF TCG. LUL
[1:23:30] <SeventyForce> Pocket Ninjas!?
[1:23:31] <Zepik> This is far more entertaining than that time I helped a tree as a WHM
[1:23:31] <Rhonne> evil ninjas!
[1:23:32] <masso101> How is this a twist when he looks like that? The most obvious traitor villain since Pokémon xy
[1:23:34] <Zerud> @AllenDeadman "As if!"
[1:23:40] <+Kareshy> Garlean ninjas look so dumb
[1:23:45] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Traiting is fun
[1:23:45] <@mothmandraws> which is the goofiest job quest story line
[1:23:48] <%budyd> Will he tell us about the memes? Mayve
[1:23:51] <%budyd> maybe
[1:23:53] <%VanaSkiller> not even a one
[1:23:54] <%MagickBurritoh> even a one
[1:23:58] <+AllenDeadman> BITCH YOU THOUGHT
[1:23:58] <%MagickBurritoh> POOF
[1:23:59] <%QuadraticGravity> BACKUP NINJAS
[1:24:01] <42nfl19> But @AngriestPat , the inverse NINJA RULE
[1:24:02] <Flyrant> we all had back up ninjas
[1:24:02] <krymzen5> @Bad1uck i remember, back before the dragon just nuked the game right? the hard reset
[1:24:03] <$Valdorick> He has NAKAMA
[1:24:04] <+TheImmortal70> BELIEVE IT
[1:24:04] <jackythefrost> I forgot that the 30-50 WHM quests are just to help a tree
[1:24:05] <@mothmandraws> so far lancers was "have you heard about courage", so far dragoon has swapped "courage" for "justive"
[1:24:06] <%Fidranth> @mothmandraws the marauder questline is preparing to fight a giant cow
[1:24:08] <redrins> Namaka fuck ye

[1:28:01] <TheViltsuZ> Elmo being strong
[1:28:03] <%AquilaHarukaze> A roe using assassinate should do more damage.
[1:28:04] <+MisterCrimson> I like how that's a forbidden technique and yet Yugiri throws it out all the time
[1:28:10] <Bad1uck> @krymzen5 So Yoshi-P basically remade the game from scratch while the old version was still running. They took current players' feedback to sculpt the game into what they really wanted to play. About 2 years after 1.0's launch 2.0 was ready which was explained in-game by Bahamut callng down Meteor to wipe out the planet
[1:28:28] <bestwaifuritsu> Yugiri throws out more LB3s than the average nin player will ever get to use lmfao
[1:28:33] <+xXCrustybunsXx> lul is he a ninja or a bkmage
[1:28:38] <@mothmandraws> I desire more jumps
[1:28:45] <BustRobot> Yugiri is pretty OP
[1:28:46] <ColRedyx> @Bad1uck Garleans called down the "meteor" which WAS Bahamut.
[1:28:47] <%TombstoneTTromboners> "revenge is great actually"
[1:28:47] <Flyrant> now you are the hoe cage

[1:29:15] <%spiritofmojave> Theme of Sad Ninja
[1:29:16] <televisedrevolting> Why is Pat a big man in this game?
[1:29:18] <Flyrant> it turns out the evil guy was still evil
[1:29:19] <@mothmandraws> got to lvl 40, aoe is unlockable, but have ot wait will stream to unlock feelsbadman

[1:29:33] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL
[1:29:34] <Basch71> Karasu's the biggest troll
[1:29:37] <NumbusPlays> well yeah, he's a ninja. they never die
[1:29:40] <Bad1uck> @ColRedyx I thought they summoned Bahmut which then brought meteor =X
[1:29:40] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Its too bad they dont do Class Quests like the SHadowbringer Benchmark
[1:29:41] <jackythefrost> Yep the hundred quests between ARR and HW are awful. Only 15 of them are actually important to the story
[1:29:45] <+Kareshy> Nope slightly different.
[1:29:45] <Zerud> @gloriusUMU even better if you make a male one with a moustache
[1:29:50] <%GarbageNirvana> Motherfucker giving off heavy Sasuke vibes here
[1:29:51] <HeadsHeldHigh> ebil
[1:29:51] <%Fidranth> that hair
[1:29:54] <%Destructive_Forces> Why is he so hot tho
[1:29:58] <+terranfirma> And they don't even give xp is the worst part
[1:30:08] <haisho> jesus christ the smug aura off of this guy
[1:30:12] <Bad1uck> Oh wait NM, Meteor was the container for Bahamut
[1:30:16] <Jdrockefeller> actually karasu is more like hisoka from hxh
[1:30:17] <%cvp5127> wait is his name literally crow?]
[1:30:18] <Bad1uck> I'm dumb AND drunk
[1:30:18] <+terranfirma> Do 100 quests for literally no story reward until the last 10
[1:30:20] <vesenwhies> cool, now I just need friends to play with, the real boss battle of any mmo
[1:30:20] <%spiritofmojave> He looks like a hot Kars
[1:30:22] <TheEvilOmega> I just fought the second primal from post ARR to Heavensward in story.
[1:30:26] <ColRedyx> @Bad1uck You forgot that Bahamut came from inside the meteor, which was actually an artificial moon, not a meteor at all.
[1:30:27] <%chad_irl> Nice
[1:30:28] <TheEvilOmega> How close am I to FLYING?
[1:30:42] <BadgerDK> you do know that if you pet any other cat like that it would kill you right?

[1:33:57] <ColRedyx> @TheEvilOmega About 5 million gil for a small house, if you can find one. Easier to join an FC with a house and use their stable.

[1:36:28] <$Valdorick> @ittla what pat is saying there, is you need to send the commission screenshot to Square, so they get banned Kappa
[1:36:33] <+dasmause> its getting reworked to only increase damage by 1.3 in ShB

[1:36:42] <Bad1uck> Song mods are clientside only, so as long as you don't show screenshots it's fine
[1:36:43] <%Kareshy> Best to use that crit with Raiton
[1:36:48] <+Justlaxy> I wish I knew hiding resets ninjutsu cast early on.
[1:36:48] <%Destructive_Forces> You have to say Ninja with an A though
[1:36:49] <aimlesshealer> @IndoorSitup Oh noooo what did they do to SCH, that was the only class I had interest in
[1:36:50] <%weissguard> **Neat.
[1:36:58] <+dasmause> raiton is kinda useless right now
[1:37:01] <Bad1uck> Song = dong
[1:37:02] <+NYCrownlessKing> it's also gaining stacks in Shadowbringers @AngriestPat allowing you to use Kassatsu 3 times

[1:43:30] <Basch71> pretty sure you can't equip the same type of ring unless its augmented?
[1:43:32] <%arcaderabbit48> Been there. This game needs to add tabs to equipment you use for various classes

[1:44:08] <snowmanse> You can buy a night pegasus and then nothing else.
[1:44:10] <%BlitzNeidhart> You sold Rat Slayer! @AngriestPat
[1:44:11] <%Kareshy> If you have 48 million gil why are you buying from the regular vendor rather than going on the market and getting HQ things
[1:44:21] <Zepik> @Basch71 that only matters if it's unique, like most of the blue gear is. NQ gear it's fine
[1:44:26] <SomersaultJustice> back to sastasha

[1:45:37] <+MugenSandan> What level was Pat at the start of this stream?
[1:45:40] <+dasmause> >BLU at 0 good work
[1:45:42] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Will you also do a primer for when the new Monster Hunter expansion comes out?
[1:45:42] <aimlesshealer> A good jump is the most important part of an MMO
[1:45:45] <%TombstoneTTromboners> i'm working on scholar + summoner myself
[1:45:45] <NoirePanzer> >BLU not maxed
[1:45:47] <jackythefrost> @AngriestPat What about Black Mage
[1:45:47] <+Brighthawk> He's on weeb street @Valdorick
[1:45:49] <%TombstoneTTromboners> then brd maybe
[1:45:49] <+TheImmortal70> You're gonna have to no life to get both DPS classes to max

[1:45:52] <@mothmandraws> I think im overlevelled at 40
[1:45:55] <ColRedyx> @mothmandraws You can pick one teleport destination to be free and change it to whatever aetheryte you're standing next to if you get the mobile authenticator app. No idea how rampant account hacking is but it definitely happens to some people.
[1:45:59] <Renuarb> @AngriestPat Your most desired Mount in this game? Or do you already have it?
[1:46:04] <masso101> But do blu though
[1:46:05] <%spiritofmojave> Monk changes look not too shabby in Shb
[1:46:08] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Hey pat do you have the pre order earring on it goes to 70 for 30% xp.
[1:46:13] <+dasmause> dont do blu on stream its boring and sucks
[1:46:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ugh. I still gotta finish the last bit of MSQ, which is a few hours of solid work. And then it's time to really focus on levelling tanks
[1:46:16] <Psyramics> The world needs a new MonHun primer after what happened to the guy who made the last one

[1:47:10] <+ToppaTenga> the story and the dialogue made me quit this game

[1:47:13] <%PROUD2beGINGER> oooooh shit
[1:47:14] <jackythefrost> My fav is the FF9 one
[1:47:15] <%TombstoneTTromboners> i used to do it so much

[1:47:19] <+SirHoneybadger> God I really need to just get back in and finish up stormblood. I pretty much stopped right after the expansion launched.
[1:47:20] <%decisivelynameless> @mothmandraws you're fine, there's no cutscenes
[1:47:21] <Bad1uck> The authenticator just gives you a second return location, you still get the first location for free
[1:47:22] <Commander_Spyke> Orbonne Monastery though
[1:47:22] <Tomschiii> i hate raids as a tank
[1:47:23] <+TheImmortal70> @mothmandraws It's a raid, you can totally skip this
[1:47:27] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Yadogari) (warning)
[1:47:28] <masso101> @jackythefrost there’s an ff9 one?!
[1:47:29] <ittla> 24 man raids are the shit
[1:47:31] <Angry_Ev1L> it is MEGA SPOILERS for shadowbrigners Kappa
[1:47:31] <%TombstoneTTromboners> city of wiping

[1:47:34] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Dun Scaith

[1:47:34] <ricotez> it used to be a sidestory
[1:47:34] <%Finaldragoon> @AngriestPat planning to get anything with those Moogle Tomestones?
[1:47:35] <%OdysseyKnight> Side story spoilers are still a kind of spoiler if you care
[1:47:35] <%spiritofmojave> Labyrinth is good fun, easy to grind too
[1:47:38] <%Voidwyvern> Dun scaith!
[1:47:38] <Infinite_parodox> Cystral Tower soon to be MSQ :3
[1:47:38] <%Ilpala> dun scaith
[1:47:39] <%PROUD2beGINGER> This was THE SHIT
[1:47:39] <%yeknomlive> oh yeah
[1:47:40] <SomersaultJustice> lies no one likes weeping city
[1:47:40] <+KoyaMusa> but crystal tower is going to be important to the new expansion
[1:47:41] <AMaidIndeed> But really it's mainstory <.<
[1:47:41] <Jack_Nightshadow> Dun Scaith
[1:47:43] <jackythefrost> @masso101 Yea its one of the void ark raids
[1:47:44] <%D33TR> dun scaith
[1:47:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> @mothman None of the raids matter. They're all just side stuff for other FF games
[1:47:45] <+StrawberryPantsu> Dun Scaith
[1:47:46] <+Sendaar> I like World of Darkness
[1:47:46] <ssks123> I did labyrinth and totally forgot most of the mechanics
[1:47:47] <%yeknomlive> dun scaith is sick
[1:47:47] <%Nobrev> although I have a feeling this raid story is gonna be super important to shadowbringers
[1:47:47] <NocturnalRites> Isnt Crystal Tower kind of related to Shb
[1:47:48] <+Talbz> Is the story all that important in this game? I just started playing and it seems pretty meh so far... @AngriestPat
[1:47:50] <Bad1uck> Dun Goofed
[1:47:50] <xeros720> is this where Cloud of Death is?
[1:47:53] <+MisterCrimson> @AngriestPat So any predictions about what EA is gonna fart out tomorrow?
[1:47:53] <%spiritofmojave> Dun Scaith is rad
[1:47:57] <xeros720> well, i guess i'll see
[1:48:01] <$KwakuAnansi> @AngriestPat Dun Scaith
[1:48:02] <%D33TR> nah, cloud is in the next of the series
[1:48:09] <xeros720> ah, i see
[1:48:12] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> One thing I like about the crossover stuff in 14, is that it's not quite the same exact thing from the original games. Most of it fits within 14's own lore.
[1:48:12] <televisedrevolting> Patron the Invisiblessed
[1:48:14] <%marsano168> Dun scaith aka "My party forgot mechanics and ate shit" raid lol
[1:48:17] <%BlitzNeidhart> @AngriestPat They reccomend you complete these before Shadowbringers actually, so they're somewhat spoilery
[1:48:20] <+darlin_bones> This looks like WoW
[1:48:24] <%OdysseyKnight> Just spam AoEs
[1:48:26] <Bad1uck> @rumtumtugnutz Cru
[1:48:28] <+KoyaMusa> @AngriestPat hide is used to refresh your mudras, so use huton > hide > suiton
[1:48:29] <xeros720> i'm pretty excited to see all the old FF bosses
[1:48:31] <Tucker0603> I want the Weeping City tank set though
[1:48:32] <%Kareshy> Mudra into Trick attack, Kassatsu into Raiton
[1:48:33] <%mayorrev> utter chaos like this kind of puts me off of MMOs in general
[1:48:36] <GreyHeartedHero> Why is this your favorite raid?
[1:48:37] <+Sendaar> Bunny of Shame
[1:48:39] <bluescreen1988> trash the trash
[1:48:39] <+Ell1ot> super bunny?
[1:48:39] <%mayorrev> :(
[1:48:52] <@mothmandraws> gonna do my roulette quick
[1:48:53] <ColRedyx> @mothmandraws Overleveling isn't a problem. You're getting a lot of extra experience in old content and that will slow down a ton once you catch up to the latest expansion. Plus the MSQ is what really takes up all the time getting your first character to max, which is HIGHLY beneficial. Don't sweat it, you get synced for anything that's supposed to be challenging anyway.
[1:48:54] <%EmiinV> suiton's the one for trick
[1:48:55] <Basch71> water
[1:48:57] <jackythefrost> @darlin_bones They are both tab target MMO's so yea they would look the same on the surface
[1:48:58] <%QuadraticGravity> In the words of Tate, "nice rabbit dipshit"
[1:48:58] <+NYCrownlessKing> water
[1:49:00] <+KoyaMusa> huton prepull boost, suiton trick attack
[1:49:00] <%Kareshy> Thing that triggers trick attack
[1:49:00] <%crowsloft77> water
[1:49:02] <+TheImmortal70> Suiton Water, lets you do hide moves without hide
[1:49:03] <%spiritofmojave> I have a harder time healing on Dun Scaith than Rabanastre
[1:49:03] <%mayorrev> the uh
[1:49:05] <%Yadogari> LUL
[1:49:05] <+MisterCrimson> use your words, Pat
[1:49:06] <$Valdorick> When you fuck up your justu rotation, you get a bunny buff - it is super shameful, and the group knows you did it.
[1:49:08] <%solomonpun> solomonpun subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Its lucky that I remembered that I have TWITCH PRIME, which gives free subs to anyone with Amazon Prime. Kappa
[1:49:08] <Pompadourius> @mayorrev after doing it for a bit it’s no big deal tbh. You get used to it
[1:49:08] <+StrawberryPantsu> The uh
[1:49:11] <%allouttajuice> Suiton is the uh x5 - Pat
[1:49:11] <Bad1uck> @rumtumtugnutz Crystal Tower matters for the ShB storyline, it's how we go to the first shard
[1:49:11] <+davos_southway> Pat kassatsu lets use use Ninjusu twice in a row.
[1:49:11] <ShichiNoBushi> "sui" = "water"
[1:49:14] <IndoorSitup> the uhhhhhhhhhh
[1:49:14] <+darlin_bones> Uh oh he’s glitching
[1:49:15] <%Innocuous_Goat> Sui means water
[1:49:17] <@mothmandraws> cool
[1:49:17] <Zepik> love the music from this raid, made grinding it a ton to buy Answers with the moogle tomes pretty easy
[1:49:17] <+RowenCleric> the uhhhhhh
[1:49:19] <Lotharman> Pat, Kassatsu gives you a free ninjutsu reseting the mudras
[1:49:20] <SeventyForce> water piggggg
[1:49:21] <ssks123> overleveling is the opposite of a problem because they just level sync you for lower level content
[1:49:23] <%crowsloft77> makes Trick attack usable without hide
[1:49:27] <+dasmause> wait that song was in the shadowbringers trailer!
[1:49:35] <RoboXGP> i complain about spending 10 bucks on this game but I spend 300 bucks on yugioh it makes no sense
[1:49:35] <$megamonmon123> pat.exe broke
[1:49:38] <odiemikes> cant wait for your wow classic stream. why play the mmo pat
[1:49:41] <+RaziWraith> raid debuff! Kreygasm
[1:49:48] <%Maruko19> I feel like Yoshi P loves FF3 a bit too much
[1:49:50] <haisho> Can't you see it? You are Number 1!
[1:49:54] <+trainflip> because youre number one
[1:49:56] <ColRedyx> @dasmause If you mean Eternal Wind, it's because that song is from FF3. Same place this raid is from.
[1:49:59] <pmtriox> hide also resets your mutra
[1:50:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Bad1uck Izzat so? Neat.
[1:50:06] <+StrawberryPantsu> you dont need to
[1:50:06] <%OdysseyKnight> Because you don't have to. Just go ham
[1:50:07] <%spiritofmojave> correct
[1:50:11] <%ArcanumMBD> you can just dps this boss down now before thats a factor
[1:50:11] <Basch71> the bosses just melt regardless LuL
[1:50:12] <jackythefrost> A lot of FFXIV's story is pulled from FF3
[1:50:13] <ColRedyx> @Maruko19 No way, Yoshi has great taste.
[1:50:15] <%marsano168> its easy to brute forcce these early raids
[1:50:17] <ssks123> mechanics? pssh just burn
[1:50:18] <Angry_Ev1L> fuck no my big dick number dps is more IMPORTANT than mechanics
[1:50:20] <%around_40_jobbers> mechanics are for chumps
[1:50:24] <%ArcanumMBD> people are grinding Syrcus Tower for moogle poetics
[1:50:25] <sandwichtaker> Are you a naruto
[1:50:30] <+StrawberryPantsu> you can auto pilot 50-60 24mans
[1:50:30] <RoboXGP> muh crystal
[1:50:30] <jackythefrost> The whole Warriors of Darkness thing is from FF3
[1:50:31] <$KwakuAnansi> @dasmause I think the ShB song is a remix of Syrcus tower's music
[1:50:33] <%OdysseyKnight> You can ignore the mechanics of almost every fight here
[1:50:34] <%TombstoneTTromboners> remember when we had to carefully lure and kill the platinals in LoTA?
[1:50:44] <+sourceofall> actually, i haven't ever seen that attack go off even once the entire time i've played that 24 man. she never lives long enough
[1:50:55] <%Maruko19> @colredyx FF3 isn't bad. I mean the DS/PC version is pretty good.
[1:51:06] <masso101> I heard the story in this game was good but the early game is pretty boring. When would you say shit pops off?
[1:51:07] <xeros720> Ultima kind of does this shit too
[1:51:10] <%trillmagical> trillmagical subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Yea, so after accumulating like 200 hours in Mon Hun GenU, going back to world feels so fucking weird man. But man is monster hunter a GREAT series.
[1:51:22] <Lotharman> Healers adjusting as much as they can
[1:51:23] <+StrawberryPantsu> Might fuck around and level NIN
[1:51:26] <Bad1uck> @rumtumtugnutz yeah check out the ShB trailer, you can see the crystal tower in the background. It exists in every world
[1:51:30] <%QuadraticGravity> I saw you not standing in the water Strident
[1:51:30] <haisho> is it Dragoon levels of active?
[1:51:32] <Angry_Ev1L> yfw you played when this mechanic mattered
[1:51:33] <+StrawberryPantsu> ya can miss me with BRD
[1:51:34] <$danteskyrim2020> Hey Pat you got me in to FF14 2 years ago. Any plans to due BA? Its the most fun I had in FF14. Cheer100
[1:51:40] <+NYCrownlessKing> Oh you have no clue yet pat @AngriestPat
[1:51:45] <%AquilaHarukaze> Damn, tried to queue for alliance raids too but ended up in a mhach run
[1:51:46] <+NYCrownlessKing> it's gonna get better enbGood
[1:51:55] <%mayorrev> Leather belt?
[1:52:02] <ColRedyx> @masso101 A little past halfway through the post-ARR patch content. It's fairly far in in terms of hours but there's a lot more story after it than before it at this point, so the majority of the game is great.
[1:52:03] <jackythefrost> @masso101 Honestly the story starts getting good near the end of ARR. Heavensward is narratively one of the best stories in the FF franchise
[1:52:05] <+Shadicara> Oh you farming glam too pat? I was doing this before Kappa
[1:52:07] <%mr_mantis1946> lytOMG
[1:52:13] <KitsuneManami> Ew Asmogold is a douche
[1:52:16] <+ShudMirelurk> Asmon DansGame
[1:52:18] <+Ell1ot> you can do it, Pat! get those viewers
[1:52:21] <NoirePanzer> Asmon LUL
[1:52:22] <%PROUD2beGINGER> You tell yourself that
[1:52:25] <Shotred> Net yet he is lol
[1:52:28] <xeros720> he's leveling in the queue
[1:52:28] <KitsuneManami> Bye
[1:52:28] <+ShudMirelurk> monkaS
[1:52:29] <krymzen5> more like assmogold
[1:52:29] <TheHotStuven> LUL
[1:52:30] <%Zamorouskiwhich> He is a rcomVariety streamer Kappa
[1:52:30] <%around_40_jobbers> monkaS
[1:52:31] <$DarkKnightGrave> MMO Funsies
[1:52:31] <+reiju_22> PogChamp
[1:52:34] <CuriousReborn> monkaS
[1:52:36] <+Shadicara> Liar LUL
[1:52:36] <%OdysseyKnight> Time to leave out of Pattish spite
[1:52:36] <%joylent_blue> D:
[1:52:37] <+MisterCrimson> I feel like Asmongold talked shit about Max one time
[1:52:39] <%budyd> big lie
[1:52:39] <ColRedyx> @masso101 And yeah, what Jacky said. It doesn't just get good, it gets way better than most of the singleplayer FFs.
[1:52:40] <Graywolf_the_45th> time to bounce
[1:52:43] <%Owkono> take hostages
[1:52:44] <+Shadicara> you'll never quit ff14
[1:52:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[1:52:47] <bestwaifuritsu> I gave up farming tower for the ninja glams because I got a new recruit for my squadron and it was wearing it LUL
[1:52:47] <Angry_Ev1L> You better play through 5.0 MSQ THIS TIME
[1:52:48] <%DXLelouch24> better hope Max isnt streaming tonight then
[1:52:51] <+thedannydarko> Red Bull in moderation Pat
[1:52:52] <Angry_Ev1L> Unlike 4.0 LIES
[1:52:54] <+StrawberryPantsu> At least he's on Par with MR Happy
[1:52:56] <%Nobrev> i hear asmogold is a piece of shit
[1:52:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> God, the emotional climax of Heavensward still gets me.
[1:52:58] <sandwichtaker> Is there gonna be a thing for E3 on SuperBeastCast?
[1:53:01] <Bad1uck> Pat isn't high enough on the Aspergers scale to beat Asmon
[1:53:07] <%Guardiansaiyan> JUST got back
[1:53:10] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat What server do you blame for each Wipe? Crystal's is Balmung or Mateus.
[1:53:12] <zedravan> time to unsubscribre from bunnyhop
[1:53:17] <Estufu> booooo
[1:53:18] <%demegodz> LUL
[1:53:20] <%Guardiansaiyan> @AngriestPat gonna have a podcast for E3 with Woolie?
[1:53:26] <BappoSama> So
[1:53:31] <TheHotStuven> This FF3 dungeon raid thing is so nostalgic
[1:53:31] <%HiroTSK5> Literally FFIII music
[1:53:35] <KruelDestiny> Raiton, apply directly to the forehead!
[1:53:36] <Pompadourius> In HW? When the vocals kick in that one time it felt like when the OP plays for the final battle of an anime
[1:53:37] <+MisterCrimson> @KitsuneManami always Alliance C
[1:53:38] <Pompadourius> Fantastic
[1:53:45] <BappoSama> Why do different enemies have different colored lifebars?
[1:53:53] <%GarbageNirvana> yooo
[1:53:54] <gypsystranger> sick
[1:53:56] <+Shadicara> Is it? yeeeeee boi
[1:53:58] <vesenwhies> yo I just died
[1:53:58] <Shotred> interesting I didnt know that, but yeah it's a good raid
[1:53:59] <+StrawberryPantsu> DO CRYSTAL TOWER
[1:54:01] <bestwaifuritsu> @BappoSama targets being engaged by other alliances
[1:54:02] <TheHotStuven> I remember back in the day when Doga and Unie kicked my ass in FF3
[1:54:02] <%marsano168> I remember when you had to do FATES to unlock this
[1:54:02] <%TombstoneTTromboners> it's all ogre for him now....
[1:54:06] <jackythefrost> @TheHotStuven Every raid in this game is a reference to other FF games
[1:54:11] <masso101> That’s a shame then, I can’t even get to the good stuff before the trial period is over. Oh well, I can wait till I’m not poor.
[1:54:13] <Lilsed81> wut class is he
[1:54:15] <%Fidranth> WHAT
[1:54:17] <ColRedyx> @BappoSama Indicating whether or not Pat has any threat on it.
[1:54:17] <%around_40_jobbers> thats a raw deal
[1:54:18] <BappoSama> @bestwaifuritsu Thanks for the information brother.
[1:54:18] <%TombstoneTTromboners> everyone is too strong now
[1:54:21] <Twerknadooo> Chat, I can't stick with a DPS to ilevel and play. I usually tank. Which job should I do?
[1:54:22] <MC_GigglePants> @Lilsed81 ninja
[1:54:25] <+Shadicara> That's because everyone got huge pat
[1:54:28] <Bad1uck> @angriestpat In the CT cutscenes it's explained that CT is the link between all of the other worlds
[1:54:29] <jackythefrost> Dun Scaith is a FF9 raid
[1:54:31] <xeros720> tank?
[1:54:31] <Lilsed81> cool thx
[1:54:37] <%OdysseyKnight> Glasya Joberas
[1:54:41] <%Maruko19> @jackythefrost Yep
[1:54:45] <Basch71> when you have augmented IW gear, who cares LuL
[1:54:47] <ColRedyx> @Twerknadooo Whichever one you like. "Meta" is BS, play whatever you want.
[1:54:48] <jackythefrost> And we just finished a full FFtactics/FFXII raid set
[1:54:50] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Everything in here is nerfed so people can do it ASAP for the expansion
[1:54:51] <Crankthulhu> Hate how I had to run out for a walk right when Pat started, he say how long he's gonna go for?
[1:54:58] <$KwakuAnansi> @BappoSama The colours change depending on which party pulled, Red = your party, purple = other
[1:55:05] <bestwaifuritsu> Shame too because Xande is a dope fight
[1:55:06] <+StrawberryPantsu> Forward and Back and go Forward and Back
[1:55:14] <bestwaifuritsu> one foot forward
[1:55:15] <x02DannyBoy> @AngriestPat what did you have to do previously in this fight pre-nerf?
[1:55:23] <Twerknadooo> @ColRedyx I couldn't care less about meta, I just didn't know which one is the most fun or which one anyone would recommend.
[1:55:26] <+StrawberryPantsu> TRANSCENDING TIME
[1:55:26] <%Gogogolem> The augmented magitek sam sword is the shit.
[1:55:28] <xeros720> store bought bullshit too strong in this game
[1:55:29] <Crankthulhu> You can also change the colors of who pulled what in the settings menu
[1:55:29] <KitsuneManami> @x02DannyBoy the plats around it
[1:55:30] <xeros720> it's crazy
[1:55:31] <MC_GigglePants> LUL
[1:55:32] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL
[1:55:33] <garbageheaphound> HA
[1:55:35] <%Kuro_Koshka> all belst always
[1:55:35] <%salty_syd913> LUL
[1:55:43] <bestwaifuritsu> A final fantasy game with BELTS?
[1:55:43] <%OdysseyKnight> Nomura must have left the loot there
[1:55:57] <%marsano168> @Twerknadooo Warrior was fun when I played it. i reccomend
[1:55:59] <Crankthulhu> All the Magitek weapons are dope. Transforming unsheath > normie unsheath
[1:56:00] <+JadeKapa> OH THAT'S WHAT THOSE JUMP PADS ARE FOR?
[1:56:00] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@JadeKapa) (warning)
[1:56:01] <+Shadicara> Watch pat get scummed out of the one bit of gear at the end
[1:56:04] <%GarbageNirvana> There's still some cool looking gear you can get from these raids tbh
[1:56:10] <+StrawberryPantsu> God I cant wait for GNB
[1:56:12] <%Fidranth> belts that aren't visible is the least nomura thing I can think of
[1:56:15] <+JadeKapa> ok
[1:56:16] <+gannondaddy> amans giant hat is dope
[1:56:16] <xeros720> nah, pat will only roll on ochestrion rolls, pets, and mounts
[1:56:18] <ColRedyx> @Twerknadooo That's completely subjective. Just because I like a job doesn't mean you would. FF14's official page has job guides for all of them that describe what they're about and detail their abilities.
[1:56:19] <%QuadraticGravity> im so happy jugulate is having its damage removed
[1:56:22] <Basch71> the healer gear you get from these dungeons look nice at least
[1:56:26] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat which Alliance Raid do you think is the Hardest?
[1:56:28] <Twerknadooo> @marsano168 yeah, I'm usually a tank main, and WAR is my favorite tank of them. Just can't find a DPS to stick with for shit.
[1:56:31] <%crowsloft77> i rememeber running this raid so many times just to get Amons hat
[1:56:47] <%Yadogari> Weeping City NotLikeThis
[1:56:51] <Bad1uck> @Twerknadooo Do you want ranged or melee?
[1:56:52] <Twerknadooo> OZMA
[1:56:52] <%Maruko19> Yuck
[1:56:52] <Renuarb> OZMA
[1:56:52] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat YOU ARE CORRECT SIR, GOOD DAY
[1:56:53] <%TombstoneTTromboners> the wiping city of tears
[1:56:54] <%Fidranth> ozma!
[1:56:54] <jackythefrost> Everyone wiped on Weeping City
[1:56:55] <CopperTucker> Syrcus is my hell. lord.
[1:56:55] <Angry_Ev1L> stupid fucks
[1:56:55] <+Shadicara> LMAO
[1:56:59] <SailingSaturn> Dun Scaith is pretty painful still cirISee
[1:57:00] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah Ozma is OOFMA
[1:57:00] <%Divryne> Ozma 2.0 was also great.
[1:57:01] <haisho> Weeping City. Definitely leaving people weeping.
[1:57:02] <$KwakuAnansi> Of course lol
[1:57:02] <bestwaifuritsu> Ozma, the scrub slayer
[1:57:03] <zamzoph> I beat Ozma in FF9 PogChamp
[1:57:03] <xeros720> ahaha, just like ff9
[1:57:03] <CybertronPrime> Back and to the left.
[1:57:03] <garbageheaphound> thats a strong name
[1:57:04] <+StrawberryPantsu> Weeping City
[1:57:04] <mr_hunter> Back and to THE LEFT you shits
[1:57:05] <+Shadicara> Wiping City amazing
[1:57:06] <%OdysseyKnight> T.G Cid is horrible too
[1:57:06] <%marsano168> @Twerknadooo I know the feel. didn't find anything until I got Machinist in HW. Now thats my main
[1:57:08] <bestwaifuritsu> Ozma is a JOKE now
[1:57:09] <Crankthulhu> Funny enough, Weeping City is my fave BECAUSE its so challenging!
[1:57:10] <%Finaldragoon> Thunder God Cid is Ozma done right, don't @ me
[1:57:10] <+Fynale> idk orbonne was pretty crazy for a few weeks on thunder king
[1:57:11] <%QuadraticGravity> Have you done Orbonne it's pretty good
[1:57:11] <Tucker0603> I want that goddamn tank gear from weeping city though
[1:57:13] <+BigBruthaThunda> reminds me of my guild wars 2 days
[1:57:13] <jackythefrost> JUST LIKE FF9
[1:57:14] <+StrawberryPantsu> Ozma was tough
[1:57:14] <GambolMuse> The one boss that had all the zombie adds and the puddles was awful too
[1:57:17] <%Maruko19> Thunder God is fun
[1:57:18] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> yeah *now* Dun Scaith is worse
[1:57:20] <%Metballs> I timed out multiple times on Cid
[1:57:20] <masso101> OZMA?! PogChamp
[1:57:20] <CalderGaming> Getting serious parasite eve flashbacks from that singing between fights
[1:57:20] <+StrawberryPantsu> Face roll now
[1:57:25] <snootyhooty> Dorito man was also a scrub check in WIping City
[1:57:31] <Twerknadooo> @Bad1uck I'd prefer melee, but I'm willing to try anything. Anything's not BLM. I don't like BLM.
[1:57:32] <TheHotStuven> THIS GUY NotLikeThis
[1:57:32] <Mastigias> Thunder God is RAD
[1:57:35] <%Metballs> People still don't get him
[1:57:35] <Basch71> TG Cid's hard but he's soooo gooooood
[1:57:36] <xeros720> TG cid is in the game?
[1:57:38] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Thunder God, aka, "Just give me my fucking armor you shitty old man!"
[1:57:38] <Crankthulhu> @masso101 When people say FFXIV is a FF theme park, they mean it
[1:57:38] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat atleast he is easier to read
[1:57:39] <jackythefrost> Everyone also wiped at Thunder God
[1:57:41] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah he might as well might be new Ozma
[1:57:43] <xeros720> no wonder i see Ramza pets
[1:57:44] <%marsano168> TG Ozma 2 electric boogaloo
[1:57:49] <%OdysseyKnight> There's a Ivalice raid
[1:57:50] <SailingSaturn> Ozma or to me "Oh shit I fell off again" LUL
[1:57:50] <A_Red_Robot> Thunder Godzma is the best part of Orbonne
[1:57:52] <Renuarb> The HW raids are in this weird spot where they're harder than the SB raids because people never run them...
[1:57:52] <%TombstoneTTromboners> i use his gloves on my bard
[1:57:53] <Crankthulhu> Oh hi bootleg Kefka LUL
[1:57:53] <+StrawberryPantsu> Thunder God not as hard as Ozma
[1:57:54] <%laazybulbasaur> Advice for newbies? @AngriestPat
[1:57:55] <%OdysseyKnight> All FFT and FF12 stuff
[1:57:57] <%Finaldragoon> @xeros720 the Stormblood 24 man raids are all based around Ivalice
[1:57:58] <TioXyco> oh hey, its that Yakuza Assassin clan
[1:57:59] <Twerknadooo> Thunder God is Ozma if Ozma never shut the fuck up
[1:58:00] <ColRedyx> You guys that started in SB think TG Cid is bad but Ozma on release would actually make groups time out.
[1:58:02] <bestwaifuritsu> Amons Hat is the fucking best. Obligatory Bard hat
[1:58:04] <+StrawberryPantsu> Matador from SMT
[1:58:05] <+RenoDeGeneric> Very Amano looking
[1:58:07] <%Yadogari> The only good run of Dun Scaith I've ever had was the first one I did when it launched
[1:58:10] <xeros720> @Finaldragoon that's so cool
[1:58:11] <%Finaldragoon> @xeros720 and yes, they are canon to Tactics somehow
[1:58:12] <Lotharman> @AngriestPat Kassatsu resets your mudras
[1:58:14] <%DXLelouch24> even in FF14 you cant Escape Amon
[1:58:14] <snootyhooty> If you don't have it, youre not a bard
[1:58:16] <%Nobrev> heh kum kum heh
[1:58:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[1:58:20] <%spiritofmojave> his hat never drops for me jermaPluto
[1:58:20] <%DXLelouch24> hes everywhere
[1:58:25] <%QuadraticGravity> I got it as a tank somehow
[1:58:26] <%Maruko19> @crankthulhu He was a thing before Kefka lol
[1:58:29] <$jobbedbone> CumCum
[1:58:33] <Bad1uck> @Twerknadooo RDM gets lots of shit for sub-par DPS but it's really fun and has insane utility
[1:58:44] <+Shadicara> Pat you lie the UK still does these fights properly Kappa
[1:58:50] <bestwaifuritsu> Everyone hates RDM until they want an Embolden LUL
[1:58:53] <jackythefrost> RDM is good but isnt viable for endgame raids
[1:58:56] <Tomschiii> its the wrost feeling getting into a raid without no knowledge. the worst
[1:59:00] <reinbachthe3rd> This is actually playable on controller?
[1:59:08] <%crowsloft77> If only Rdm could wear that amazing hat
[1:59:12] <xeros720> ahaha, that's great
[1:59:12] <+SolverCODO> It plays really well on a controller ya
[1:59:14] <Crankthulhu> @bestwaifuritsu Everyone hates RDM until the two healers suck ass
[1:59:15] <+StrawberryPantsu> yes @reiju_22
[1:59:17] <zamzoph> NotLikeThis
[1:59:20] <krymzen5> thats amazing
[1:59:21] <+TheImmortal70> It's very good on controller apparently
[1:59:22] <xeros720> oh, they need to be iced to be a shield
[1:59:22] <Pompadourius> @reinbachthe3rd not just playable, for many people controller is preferable
[1:59:24] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL
[1:59:25] <Bad1uck> @reinbachthe3rd Yes, some of the top players are on PS4 playing with controllers
[1:59:25] <jackythefrost> @reinbachthe3rd FFXIV has insane controller support
[1:59:26] <xeros720> wow, that's a lot of shit
[1:59:28] <+bu77leak> every fuckin time they burn the ice men and we wipe
[1:59:28] <thwak> !uptime
[1:59:28] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 59m.
[1:59:32] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> I hope casters get some more stylish looking gear for ShB
[1:59:33] <Pompadourius> CONTROLLER MAINS RISE UP
[1:59:33] <+StrawberryPantsu> Controller Controls are great

[2:00:12] <Bad1uck> @reinbachthe3rd Controller has a bit of a learning curve if you're coming from KB+M but I got used ot it and love it
[2:00:14] <+StrawberryPantsu> Might switch h to control again at some point

[2:00:46] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Xande Griffith
[2:01:02] <%Fidranth> yes, pull the boss out of the dot aoes
[2:01:20] <TheHotStuven> Tfw you give up your immortality for power just to die LUL
[2:01:20] <indig0bird> it bad
[2:01:27] <xeros720> next phase he throws out all the food in your house, so you need to leave and go buy more
[2:01:28] <ColRedyx> @reinbachthe3rd It's not just playable, it's BETTER on controller. The only exception being targeting heals but if you get good you can even do that pretty well.
[2:01:28] <Basch71> time to see who wipes to ancient quake LuL
[2:01:34] <zamzoph> How are you supposed to know these boss mechanics? NotLikeThis
[2:01:41] <$jobbedbone> weeb puddle

[2:01:43] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> get rescue ready for ancient quake, healers

[2:01:47] <%QuadraticGravity> Count how many people die to Quaga, it's the best
[2:01:47] <Crankthulhu> @AngriestPat I smell a shitty tank that isnt keeping the boss in place
[2:01:48] <bestwaifuritsu> you read a text guide
[2:01:48] <%PauliusMaximus> PauliusMaximus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! WOOOO FF14, i like this game it's pretty alright
[2:01:49] <%TombstoneTTromboners> you learn pretty quick
[2:01:53] <%D33TR> you look them up when its old or when its new trial and error
[2:01:54] <+Shadicara> I knew them the moment I first started it's not that hard to figure out LUL
[2:02:00] <%OdysseyKnight> WutFace
[2:02:01] <KruelDestiny> trial and error @zamzoph
[2:02:01] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> That's bad. Kill it. LUL
[2:02:02] <Bad1uck> @Twerknadooo My advice is to unlock a class then go through palace of the dead/heaven on high so you can see what they're like going from lvl 1-70
[2:02:09] <Shotred> Hashirama time
[2:02:12] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Did the race war start yet?
[2:02:18] <+TheImmortal70> Man I hope they make new healer mechanics that's not just "Healers get targeted by this
[2:02:18] <Rhonne> if it has a red life bar, it needs to die
[2:02:20] <+Shadicara> That and death helps you learn fast Kappa
[2:02:22] <reinbachthe3rd> Controller positivity is making me want to give this game a second shot, especially coming off of WoW fatigue.
[2:02:29] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL one dead
[2:02:31] <Basch71> bard ate shit
[2:02:35] <%QuadraticGravity> ONE BARD
[2:02:37] <ColRedyx> @zamzoph Don't listen to them. You only need to look up mechanics if your eyes or brain don't work. Just pay attention to what's happening and you should be able to figure it out easily. It's all just cause and effect.
[2:02:39] <bestwaifuritsu> TYPICAL BARD
[2:02:45] <+TheImmortal70> Alliance B getting exposed
[2:02:47] <xeros720> been doing hard Ifrit today and it bugs me how people are fucking up that fight

[2:02:53] <theobble> bard in B and same C whm
[2:03:01] <+Shadicara> I will be that guy Kappa
[2:03:03] <Basch71> I play on controller and all classes feel fine
[2:03:05] <Crankthulhu> I dare to say there are far more controller players in FFXIV than KBM players
[2:03:06] <%Mawarup> its fine on keyboard

[2:03:20] <Bad1uck> @reinbachthe3rd Pat did a AMAZING tutorial on how to set up your controller and game settings. Check out his VoD from a few nights ago
[2:03:22] <+Shadicara> Looking up fights beforehand kills immersion plebs Kappa

[2:04:03] <%TombstoneTTromboners> 51 hype
[2:04:04] <%Top35> Have you healed with controller and if so how welldoes it work?
[2:04:06] <ColRedyx> @reinbachthe3rd I also came to 14 from mythic raiding in WoW. It was starting to fuck my wrists up. Controller is way more comfortable and just as capable for tanks and DPS.
[2:04:11] <thetyrantcbass> Diablo: also better on controller
[2:04:11] <+Shadicara> I thought that bard age shit again LOL
[2:04:12] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Remember when Behemoth was the Noob Wall?
[2:04:17] <Crankthulhu> Just make WoW 2 you cowards
[2:04:18] <%spiritofmojave> nice
[2:04:18] <Bad1uck> @AngriestPat He wants you to see his BIG SHIT, he so proud
[2:04:18] <%Typhaeon> It's perfect for you
[2:04:22] <@mothmandraws> pat finished his thign faster than im doing satascha
[2:04:23] <%king_wragles> So this is end game content for FF14?
[2:04:24] <xeros720> WoW is literally starting over and it's the best thing that can happen to it
[2:04:29] <%crowsloft77> @king_wragles Nope
[2:04:30] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Hey pat have you told woolie that Kimari is coming in shadowbringers?
[2:04:31] <%king_wragles> Why is everything just fucking metling?
[2:04:31] <+Silentman0> don't you want to be a cerberus pat?
[2:04:32] <+Mekhet09> Run before you get stuck with a bunch of shitty items.
[2:04:34] <+Shadicara> Should have rolled female pat Kappa
[2:04:36] <%king_wragles> @crowsloft77 OH THANK GOD
[2:04:42] <ssks123> this was endgame content like 4 years ago
[2:04:42] <%logoth_> The only way WoW2 would be worth a shit is if they brought back the original staff
[2:04:43] <+Shadicara> No this is old end game content
[2:04:44] <r_Foeburden87> that was lv50 endgame
[2:04:45] <krymzen5> ur selling me on 14 way too hard pat
[2:04:49] <%Guardiansaiyan> @king_wragles climate change
[2:04:56] <xeros720> mostly due to the level sync letting people having 50-70 ilevel above their normal difficulty, it's wild
[2:04:56] <ssks123> this is pre-expansion content
[2:04:57] <ColRedyx> @Top35 The only hard part is targeting party members, but the GCD is slower than WoW's so you have a little more time, and most raid healing is AoE anyway. You'll get good at it with practice.
[2:04:59] <thetyrantcbass> This was midcore content 3 expansions ago
[2:05:02] <%king_wragles> I was gonna say this is garbage if the end game just fucking crumbles
[2:05:05] <+Shadicara> Everyone is level 70 now that's 50. Everyone got huge
[2:05:08] <jackythefrost> @xeros720 Its not tho. WoW Vanilla won't be updated at all after release. The confirmed once you reach Lich King thats it

[2:06:39] <%TenderBabyBacon> Pat, so what is the general rule for loot rolls, is it just what matches what you are using since your character can run multiple jobs. Just don't want to be that asshole

[2:09:27] <+Ranger_Boon> thanks for the heads up!
[2:09:28] <%AncelDeLambert> mute the stream and go beat off, you've been warned
[2:09:29] <Ghost__Pantsu> Just AFK watch the stream :)
[2:09:30] <+Slivis117> @Bad1uck you just close the game and re log. it skips the CS and save like 20 minutes on the run
[2:09:30] <$EnervatedGaming> Leave the stream he said?! doodYelp coxManleee
[2:09:32] <%AuksMattin> don't worry Pat, I have no idea wtf is going on, I won't leave LUL
[2:09:32] <krymzen5> honestly for me mmos are all about the big shiny numbers. so idc
[2:09:34] <Bad1uck> @reinbachthe3rd TONS
[2:09:35] <Rhonne> i liked how they did this final dungeon, but I totally understand why they never did it again
[2:09:40] <redial_nick> jokes on you i'm multitasking anyway
[2:09:42] <%DXLelouch24> i cant wait to curbstomp the boss in NG+ later
[2:09:42] <Basch71> nah you can just pick them up and mash the teleporter
[2:09:42] <%Mythicalbrit> @reinbachthe3rd Fuck Tons
[2:09:43] <pmtriox> or if he's a boss mutha fucka he kills everyone
[2:09:45] <+Slivis117> @Nobrev you just close the game and re log. it skips the CS and save like 20 minutes on the run
[2:09:47] <+Mekhet09> Are you doing this the actual way?
[2:09:52] <Basch71> I do that all the time
[2:09:53] <%Finaldragoon> SourPls
[2:09:54] <sgtlaggy> why does the target marker look like a butt plug?
[2:09:55] <+metalsiren31> Yeah it's kind of ridiculous but it works
[2:09:58] <ReiDuran> Gear has basically left Castrum in the dust
[2:09:59] <+Shadicara> Yeah people just run into the teleporter and it glitches the mobs
[2:10:00] <Twerknadooo> Is that one SAM just doing the same first hit of his combo over and over again?
[2:10:05] <haveswordmuststing> that was a weird moment when i first ran Praetorium
[2:10:09] <+Mekhet09> People hate rerunning it so basically they just skip as much as they can.
[2:10:11] <Ion_Laser> YE YE YE
[2:10:11] <MC_GigglePants> DO A FLIP
[2:10:12] <%Guardiansaiyan> Kokage!
[2:10:13] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat they need a "Dungeon Trash Drops Toggle"
[2:10:16] <Dreath1997> I love listening to you whilst I play my triple triad tournaments, pattycakes
[2:10:17] <Rhonne> there's no actually loot here, right?
[2:10:20] <%Wonderbot3000> Now shout saskue
[2:10:22] <r_Foeburden87> FLIP
[2:10:24] <Basch71> no loot
[2:10:24] <+MeatBomb> He looks like a chocobo.
[2:10:25] <+gannondaddy> no loot
[2:10:27] <Basch71> just exp
[2:10:31] <$TsundereFFXIV> Roe NINs are walking oxymorons
[2:10:31] <KruelDestiny> Pat is the Hokage PogChamp
[2:10:32] <theobble> do a flip
[2:10:34] <ShichiNoBushi> I don't. Because he's a ninja.
[2:10:37] <%Finaldragoon> I love this song
[2:10:45] <+Zepshire> or a triple triad card
[2:10:51] <%Guardiansaiyan> That place reminds me of Zanarkands ruined arena
[2:10:51] <krymzen5> holy shit thts dumb
[2:10:53] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Watching that actually reminds me of the dumbest fucking thing in Avatar: the giant robot combat knife.
[2:10:55] <haisho> that's so dumb
[2:11:00] <pmtriox> and that's why having 2 tanks is great
[2:11:03] <+StrawberryPantsu> DO THE FLIP @angriestpat
[2:11:09] <bestwaifuritsu> its super old content, no one cares about it anymore
[2:11:26] <xeros720> single targets are for single targets
[2:11:32] <clool> @AngriestPat hello is theres any dmg meter or something tells u thats ur doing good ?
[2:11:39] <bestwaifuritsu> 150 potency times 10 enemies is MORE DAMAGE. Use your AOEs people
[2:11:40] <+StrawberryPantsu> sbfpSetIn
[2:11:40] <Anubis> "less than 3? no AOE"
[2:11:41] <xeros720> and man, those ninja aoes seem really good
[2:11:42] <KitsuneManami> Hello Husbando
[2:11:43] <jackythefrost> GAIUS
[2:11:44] <ColRedyx> @xeros720 Single or double
[2:11:45] <+l3sovikk> That guy looks dope
[2:11:45] <transporterthesequel> Yeaaah this best boi
[2:11:45] <+wsmccall> nice glamour pat
[2:11:47] <ReiDuran> I thought it was 4 or more
[2:11:47] <haisho> NOPE
[2:11:53] <+StrawberryPantsu> GAIUS WAS RIGHT
[2:11:54] <haveswordmuststing> @roasted_pheasant Eva also has a combat knife for mechas
[2:11:56] <transporterthesequel> Gaius was right.jpeg
[2:11:56] <TheEvilOmega> Must needs. You're too bloody useful.
[2:11:57] <+Dessbocito2> not exactly
[2:11:57] <@Velyndra> No, *wink*
[2:12:01] <GypsySquid> Most standard AoE rotations do not have diminishing returns, use your AoEs guys.
[2:12:01] <Rhonne> oh i forgot there was no voice acting in most of this dungeon
[2:12:04] <Tucker0603> I want that helm
[2:12:05] <Twerknadooo> If you have an AoE that does 50 to everything you hit, or a single target that hits for 140, do the 50 on 3+ targets. 50x3>140.
[2:12:05] <pmtriox> i've found i burn down mobs faster single target until there's 5 in the mob
[2:12:06] <%mayorrev> what's parsing?
[2:12:07] <Carcino> Is this the one you did on the old channel?
[2:12:08] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @haveswordmuststing THATS STUPID.
[2:12:08] <%spiritofmojave> I had a buddy who played MCH and just AOE'd constantly for one mob
[2:12:09] <%Mawarup> parser is illegal
[2:12:11] <mrpandabear437> my friend looked up my raid damage once and made fun of me lol
[2:12:11] <clool> how ur gona know thats ur dooing good ?
[2:12:12] <TheEvilOmega> Cid nan bloody Garland
[2:12:12] <transporterthesequel> I parse by AGGRO GENERATED
[2:12:13] <%king_wragles> ... there's a ban on wanting to be better?
[2:12:13] <+trainflip> "no"
[2:12:14] <%Guardiansaiyan> MercyWing1 apatBlep MercyWing2
[2:12:14] <ColRedyx> Just don't give people shit about their DPS in a way that reveals that you're parsing.
[2:12:15] <bear_breaker20> atpRtsd4
[2:12:15] <Basch71> just give me Gaius' gear goddamn it
[2:12:16] <Murdercles> why would they care
[2:12:16] <Angry_Ev1L> People stream with parsers and nobody gives a shit
[2:12:18] <+Shadicara> I feel they should of made this something you can do as a single player
[2:12:20] <IndoorSitup> @angriestpat How do I cope with how badly SCH is about to be shafted and how boring it'll be to play? plz answer
[2:12:21] <%Wonderbot3000> go for the big parse
[2:12:21] <JoshTheFace> ResidentSleeper
[2:12:21] <%OdysseyKnight> and if you try to weaponize a parse against someone else, expect to get fucked over
[2:12:21] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Roasted_Pheasant) (warning)
[2:12:22] <%logoth_> Why is Grahf in this game
[2:12:24] <xeros720> as long as you aren't dying, i assume your damage is decent
[2:12:26] <krymzen5> is that an ff12 guy???
[2:12:29] <+StrawberryPantsu> Dont talk about it. Some with visual mods
[2:12:30] <bestwaifuritsu> I hate that Gaius isnt voiced by fucking Batou anymore
[2:12:30] <+Mekhet09> Parsers really suck.
[2:12:30] <+KoyaMusa> it's okay to be grey
[2:12:31] <Angry_Ev1L> So yeah just don't shout about you using one and you'll be fine
[2:12:32] <ColRedyx> @xeros720 LUL
[2:12:32] <%Roasted_Pheasant> giant robots should NOT knife
[2:12:33] <haisho> yes
[2:12:34] <+Dessbocito2> you can totally parse, you just cant harrass or tell other they are not doing well because they are not doing high dps
[2:12:34] <Rhonne> yes
[2:12:35] <%Nobrev> yes
[2:12:35] <MC_GigglePants> yes
[2:12:35] <@JustinianKnight> yes
[2:12:37] <+SlowLikeThunder> yeah
[2:12:38] <TioXyco> yes
[2:12:38] <MrNoobMcSalt> Y
[2:12:39] <%logoth_> Its not FF12 guy its fucking Grahf
[2:12:39] <Ion_Laser> yes
[2:12:40] <ShichiNoBushi> No dialogue, but yes.
[2:12:40] <$EnervatedGaming> yes
[2:12:41] <%spiritofmojave> Gaius is just Darth Vader in this shit
[2:12:42] <DonovynN> you can parse but you cant bring up numbers in chat
[2:12:42] <Bad1uck> yep
[2:12:43] <%AuksMattin> yea
[2:12:44] <Tucker0603> yes
[2:12:46] <%Tearonex> yup
[2:12:47] <+l3sovikk> Why are parsers illegal?
[2:12:49] <+StrawberryPantsu> ye
[2:12:49] <%spiritofmojave> si
[2:12:50] <bear_breaker20> dont wanna upset the monks
[2:12:55] <%Hallommig> ye its a setting for the game , clicking out mutes the game
[2:12:56] <Zepik> yes in fact you taught us how to make it do that last time
[2:13:02] <+Whodolfus> Parsing is more of a "don't ask don't tell" kind of thing, they're fine with parsing as long as you don't talk about it in game or use it to harass people
[2:13:03] <Ghost__Pantsu> Oh I just thought there was no voice acting lobosLULN
[2:13:04] <ColRedyx> @xeros720 I'm sorry to say you would be wrong on that one.
[2:13:12] <%GarbageNirvana> Maybe they're afraid parsing will give people advantages in stuff like pvp or something
[2:13:16] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Gais over here doing Nero dirty
[2:13:18] <%mh9s> pat screm
[2:13:20] <%king_wragles> So, just to be clear: if I want to know if I'm dead weight or not I literally am not allowed to measure it because of people's feelings?
[2:13:21] <xeros720> @ColRedyx I know, but I like to believe
[2:13:21] <pmtriox> here's the part where the bad guy says you got big dick energy and he's totally impressed with it
[2:13:23] <+Azarian1> Curious if pat plays with the English VA or Japanese

[2:13:49] <badhaye> you get a SICK MOUNT
[2:13:50] <GingerSen> that place was a madhouse, and I loved every second of it
[2:13:52] <+Shadicara> Pat you look techno as shit
[2:13:53] <transporterthesequel> Need Judge armor NAO
[2:13:53] <Mastigias> It's fun, but getting in is a pain in the ass
[2:13:55] <r_Foeburden87> 3 Eyes
[2:13:55] <count_bob> ....His helmet is kinda dumb.
[2:13:56] <+TheImmortal70> Bald Arse
[2:13:57] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Is Baldesian Arsenal a superboss or something?
[2:13:58] <xeros720> Big, arsenal
[2:13:58] <Tucker0603> fucking rad
[2:13:58] <x3as> Gaius was right!
[2:13:58] <+Zepshire> parsers are illegal to prevent players from harassing others about dps numbers
[2:13:58] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> YoshiP, give me this armor already!
[2:13:58] <%Divryne> Daddy Gaius.
[2:13:59] <%Fidranth> Gaius: "I must consult with the Elder Ascians. Fight this instead."
[2:13:59] <CrimsonGargoyle> is aight
[2:14:01] <ChronosScion> But BA has a Ozma mount
[2:14:02] <mynameismatt123> Can you get it though?
[2:14:03] <SeventyForce> Burning Asshoke!?
[2:14:03] <krymzen5> He looks super ff12
[2:14:05] <Dreath1997> Is Eureka worth doing?
[2:14:06] <indig0bird> Super Saiyan Vader there
[2:14:10] <mrpandabear437> until stormblood i thought that was their faces
[2:14:11] <AdmiralButtloaf> should do shiva
[2:14:12] <NocturnalRites> They need to give us sick ass judge armor in thi sgame
[2:14:13] <rmwolfe> he looks like grahf from xenogears
[2:14:13] <bestwaifuritsu> aww
[2:14:14] <Lotharman> Pat, Kassatsu resets mudras, so you can use two ninjutsus in a row
[2:14:15] <$jobbedbone> THE BELTS
[2:14:18] <%spiritofmojave> Gaius has the best 2.0 VA
[2:14:22] <%Nobrev> parsing is bannable probably because people got super toxic about dps numbers for a while
[2:14:23] <Bad1uck> I wonder what he looks like under that mask. I bet he's hot
[2:14:24] <%OdysseyKnight> Iron GIANT
[2:14:25] <%GarbageNirvana> oho nooo
[2:14:28] <theobble> The devs flip flopped on the issue of parsing several times saying they are reconsidering their stance. But, the last time it was brought up in a QA, Yoshida said they thought about putting in a first party damage meter, but, changed their minds.
[2:14:28] <%Divryne> What will Pat ever do?
[2:14:29] <KitsuneManami> Suuuper Maaan
[2:14:30] <pmtriox> sure does
[2:14:35] <%spiritofmojave> monkaS
[2:14:35] <haveswordmuststing> Somehow Nero is still cooler JUST because of rocket hammer
[2:14:35] <+StrawberryPantsu> Thordan is dope
[2:14:37] <+Deano8817> TAAR KUS
[2:14:39] <AdmiralButtloaf> magitek colossus
[2:14:40] <transporterthesequel> @Nobrev That is literally the exact stated reason
[2:14:46] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Buuuuuuurned
[2:14:47] <%Kaask> look at pat learning to play the game
[2:14:49] <+Shadicara> Blew pats mind
[2:14:50] <Rhonne> lol, that thing is just a random trash mob in the most recent Stormblood dungeon
[2:14:52] <xeros720> wow, he's dropping like a rock
[2:14:53] <bestwaifuritsu> the teacher has become the student
[2:14:54] <+NYCrownlessKing> its getting 3 charges for shadowbringers @AngriestPat
[2:14:54] <+Mekhet09> The problem with parsing is that people get super shitty about it.
[2:14:54] <+KoyaMusa> @AngriestPat kassatsu resets your mudra and makes it a crit, so never use it on suiton
[2:14:56] <+SlowLikeThunder> READ YOUR TOOLTIPS PAT
[2:14:58] <pmtriox> Ninja is ALLL about keeping Mudra up at all times
[2:14:59] <+NYCrownlessKing> so you can use it 3 times @AngriestPat
[2:14:59] <%Fidranth> "read your tooltips"
[2:15:00] <Zepik> good ol Praetoreum now I can make dinner and turn the stream into a podcast
[2:15:00] <+Whodolfus> You can also use Hide to rest mudras
[2:15:01] <+Zepshire> use hide then kasatsu
[2:15:02] <+Azarian1> Ninja's so rad
[2:15:07] <%spiritofmojave> Read your tooltips LUL
[2:15:08] <+Azarian1> and Lala ninja's are adorably funny
[2:15:25] <+Shadicara> Use trick attack, trick attack machine Kappa
[2:15:26] <Basch71> and TCJ needs no ninki Kreygasm
[2:15:27] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> airplane run
[2:15:30] <%Roasted_Pheasant> No but what is Baldesian Arsenal tho
[2:15:31] <MC_GigglePants> beep beep
[2:15:38] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat That's not how you use a number pad
[2:15:39] <Twerknadooo> I love that Cid's button pushing boop boop animation is just pointing at the pad
[2:15:41] <xeros720> Elmo is secretly magitek

[2:15:58] <%0dd0ne0ut> @AngriestPat HEY PAT How can Y'shtola be the best if she is a black mage now HMMMMM?
[2:16:02] <%Nobrev> @Roasted_Pheasant the bug ~56 person raid at the end of eureka
[2:16:02] <$jobbedbone> WHY DOES CID RAVE PANTS
[2:16:02] <+Whodolfus> You can huton, use hide, suiton, use trick attack, and then kassatsu to get a mudra in during trick attack
[2:16:11] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Gotcha
[2:16:18] <Bad1uck> Skelmo evolved into Cymo, Cyborg Elmo
[2:16:21] <+Whodolfus> But you have to hide before you hit anything

[2:18:59] <$jobbedbone> your guy looks so dumb
[2:19:03] <Tucker0603> Maggie is the true best girl
[2:19:09] <xeros720> a bunch of ff12 stuff was just star wars wasn't it?
[2:19:17] <%GarbageNirvana> They're never improving the texture quality in this game, are they
[2:19:23] <krymzen5> chat, what's ur fave final fantasy? mines 6
[2:19:26] <transporterthesequel> My waifu was turned into a Magitek armor!
[2:19:27] <%Fidranth> 4
[2:19:30] <%Swampykins> 6
[2:19:30] <+StrawberryPantsu> >The best FF game in Years is an MMO
[2:19:32] <%spiritofmojave> Tactics or 12
[2:19:33] <MC_GigglePants> 9
[2:19:34] <+Brighthawk> X
[2:19:36] <reinbachthe3rd> 9
[2:19:37] <NocturnalRites> 6
[2:19:38] <%MagickBurritoh> ponteeous
[2:19:39] <%Roasted_Pheasant> X-2
[2:19:47] <$jobbedbone> 4 is for people who never grew up
[2:19:48] <bestwaifuritsu> have fun being cutscene chained to Nero
[2:19:49] <Thalchampz> mine is 9
[2:19:51] <MC_GigglePants> Tactics is a close second though
[2:19:51] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> 6, definitely
[2:19:54] <krymzen5> @spiritofmojave tacticts is a great choice
[2:19:54] <xeros720> probably 6, but 10 I really liked playing
[2:19:54] <%Fidranth> @jobbedbone rude
[2:20:02] <Ion_Laser> PogChamp
[2:20:03] <+alphonseisbest> 15
[2:20:04] <+StrawberryPantsu> XIV is my favorite
[2:20:08] <+StrawberryPantsu> the 4
[2:20:09] <%alexe76> alexe76 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[2:20:12] <%Roasted_Pheasant> No but X-2 is a lot better than people give it credit for
[2:20:15] <ReiDuran> Remember when FINAL FANTASY happened?
[2:20:25] <MC_GigglePants> Agreed that X-2 is very underrated
[2:20:26] <%snow_bush> Is the music fucky for anyone else?
[2:20:29] <%marsano168> My favs will always be 7 and 9
[2:20:29] <xeros720> X-2's battle system was a lot more in depth than i gave it credit
[2:20:32] <jackythefrost> X-2 has great gameplay
[2:20:33] <collindoucet99> why does that mech look so dumb lmao
[2:20:36] <krymzen5> x2 is underrated
[2:20:36] <Rhonne> can't believe Pat is just staying back and hiding while all his friends to all the work for him
[2:20:38] <+Shadicara> is it bad I enjoyed ff14s story more than 15?
[2:20:38] <bestwaifuritsu> How nice of them
[2:20:45] <bestwaifuritsu> They must think youre new LUL
[2:20:46] <KruelDestiny> FeelsGoodMan
[2:20:47] <guppy_> sHOW ELMO
[2:20:49] <NocturnalRites> X-2 had a cool battle system I just hated the story
[2:20:50] <transporterthesequel> KILL that man
[2:20:57] <LandOfTheWay> shut up that mech is the best
[2:20:58] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Also X-2 brought the world Paine and it will always get props for that
[2:21:03] <Mr_Strut> Shut up. Magitek armor is great.
[2:21:05] <jackythefrost> @collindoucet99 Its the FF6 Magitech Armor
[2:21:06] <%OdysseyKnight> You didn't turn them on
[2:21:06] <%spiritofmojave> hey magitek armor is neato
[2:21:07] <xeros720> games like X-2 and Octopath make me realize I'm really bad at breaking games with lots of jobs
[2:21:09] <haisho> who said Magitek looks dumb?! GET HIM
[2:21:10] <%furiousfurioso> YEA
[2:21:12] <+Kise77> but why
[2:21:13] <@ThePlotHole> Remember when that arm would dismount you
[2:21:13] <%Nobrev> 8, 10-2, and 13 aren't as awful as everyone says but still bottom tier for me
[2:21:16] <collindoucet99> I've never played a FF game
[2:21:19] <RubyPilot> why am i watching a man play msq roulette when i need to do my own msq roulette
[2:21:21] <jackythefrost> No 8 is bad
[2:21:24] <krymzen5> i kust love how japanese x-2 feels. with the idol stuff
[2:21:25] <Mr_Strut> So play a FF game
[2:21:27] <GypsySquid> Also that one dungeon where you have to charge some invisible blade for Alisiae.
[2:21:29] <rekinom> Is this game good on controller?
[2:21:29] <Tucker0603> don't talk shit about best mech girl Maggie
[2:21:35] <%spiritofmojave> 8 gave us Gunblade atleast
[2:21:36] <pmtriox> its not a mech if it doesn't have arms for seemingly no purpose
[2:21:37] <%OdysseyKnight> Pat you left the party effects at Limited
[2:21:39] <%TG_Cid11> Never do MSQ ever
[2:21:41] <xeros720> this game is awesome on controller
[2:21:42] <%snow_bush> Its' a Mechabo
[2:21:46] <%GarbageNirvana> Yuna dances and people die
[2:21:49] <%GarbageNirvana> People die and Yuna dances
[2:21:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> a Boss?
[2:21:50] <%maskedriderhero> That Strident guy seems like a really bad player, you should kick him forever
[2:21:51] <bestwaifuritsu> Hammer Time
[2:21:54] <%AquilaHarukaze> Watching someone else play MSQ roulette is like playing MSQ roulette only the 20% of gameplay is ALSO cutscene.
[2:21:55] <%Mawarup> turn it all on Pat
[2:21:57] <+Kise77> @rekinom Yoshi-P plays with a control so it's very well optimized on controller
[2:22:02] <Tucker0603> FURTHER BEYOND!
[2:22:03] <RubyPilot> its time to listen to someone talk for TEN MINUTES!
[2:22:05] <+StrawberryPantsu> Play FF4 first if you're new to FF
[2:22:10] <%Roasted_Pheasant> I have no idea what this is
[2:22:11] <krymzen5> go ham pat, see nothing ever
[2:22:12] <jackythefrost> Nah
[2:22:14] <jackythefrost> FF2
[2:22:15] <jackythefrost> best
[2:22:17] <%Mawarup> Hammer Time
[2:22:17] <+LowBatteryLife> X-2 final rev lets you train giant dragons to fight every battle for you, massively improving the game.
[2:22:19] <xeros720> time to fire Elmo at full power

[2:22:43] <ExpressNode> I never hear anyone talk about FF5
[2:22:47] <%OdysseyKnight> Time for best boy
[2:22:48] <krymzen5> just played ff9 for the first time, kinda sad i slept on it
[2:22:50] <pmtriox> helmet off pat, you know this to be true
[2:22:50] <RubyPilot> are you ready for this /ten minute long monologue/
[2:22:53] <%Nobrev> never start the final fantasy series on 2
[2:22:57] <xeros720> that's because we didn't get ff5 in the states for a long time
[2:22:59] <+dyedeme> V is super good.
[2:23:00] <jackythefrost> FF5 is more comedic than other FF games
[2:23:01] <%OdysseyKnight> The Vergil to Cid's Dante
[2:23:02] <+Azarian1> YEAH NERO IS COMING UP
[2:23:02] <%Roasted_Pheasant> X-2 HD Collection lets you do dumb bullshit, which is fun. But it lets your do it first playthrough which feels weird tbh.
[2:23:04] <Jakeofalco> @angriestpat how are you getting 200+ exp bonus?

[2:27:34] <Angry_Ev1L> like it did with 1.0?
[2:27:34] <%Kaask> hes really amazing, and im disappointed they keep giving Uematsu the reins for expansion main themes.
[2:27:35] <ReiDuran> @AngriestPat have you heard the ShB battle theme yet? It's fucking amazing

[2:27:37] <%mayorrev> @AngriestPat Like lawbreakers
[2:27:39] <x3as> 1.0 Limsa is godlike
[2:27:40] <AmericanaRed> the meat beater
[2:27:40] <thenix> pretty sure this song was before 2.0 actually
[2:27:41] <+gannondaddy> soken is a god

[2:28:30] <%mayorrev> qoq this music
[2:28:33] <jackythefrost> The ShB battle theme seems a lot more divisive since its hard rock and starts with a guitar riff @AngriestPat
[2:28:36] <%spiritofmojave> His big ability is just bumper cars
[2:28:36] <%mayorrev> wow*
[2:28:41] <%Fidranth> Alexander is the best, no fights here
[2:28:43] <suikudo> Sephirot and Shiva have godlike music
[2:28:45] <ColRedyx> @Kaask Nah the main themes are great. It's good that they have the classic sound. Soken's best work is banging combat music.

[2:33:01] <ShichiNoBushi> "Are We the baddies?"
[2:33:03] <krymzen5> that makes a good villain
[2:33:04] <+MisterCrimson> he's not wrong, he's just an asshole
[2:33:05] <Angry_Ev1L> He is still full of shit you know that right?
[2:33:06] <x3as> Gaius was right!
[2:33:07] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> It's cause he says it with conviction
[2:33:09] <%around_40_jobbers> Gaius was right
[2:33:12] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL The Garleans were so fucking good at their job they had to pull the Literally Hitler card later
[2:33:12] <transporterthesequel> Gaius WAS right, the emperor is full race war
[2:33:14] <%TheShal> Gaius did nothing wrong
[2:33:14] <speximillian> Gaius is Batou, ye. Also old man Joeseph Jostar, and Ansem, seeker of darkness.
[2:33:15] <%Jamejarrs> cheer505 Got my first paycheck from my new job today and I'm tempted to upgrade to deluxe just for the fat chocobo. I'll leave it up to you to convince me not to or to enable me! Your choice!

[2:33:28] <Comrade_Vladof> Varis did a big Hitler
[2:33:29] <kingra> STARTS NOW
[2:33:29] <%Kawaii_Joker> Kawaii_Joker subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! I went the my apartment laundry facility when this speeach started, folded all my cloths and walked back and its still going.
[2:33:31] <%spiritofmojave> Nazis yeah
[2:33:32] <%TheShal> Garleans wish they were as cool as Zeon
[2:33:32] <AMaidIndeed> Fantasy NAzis
[2:33:33] <+gannondaddy> ONE SINGLE RACE
[2:33:33] <RupanSen> that's pretty cheap writing
[2:33:33] <ittla> every villain is cartoonishly evil in this game after arr
[2:33:34] <ReiDuran> @AngriestPat Gaius ends up [SPOILERS] anyway so it's fine
[2:33:34] <KruelDestiny> ! RACEWAR !
[2:33:37] <%wolfdude_120> Varis is literally just magic Hitler
[2:33:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> Woooow

[2:33:48] <$OmegaWeltall> yea caues when you realy look at it, Eorzeans aint shit LUL
[2:33:50] <Shotred> Screw that they should made it compelling
[2:33:51] <speximillian> Guys Gaius is super cool and just wants everyone to join Zeon
[2:33:52] <%budyd> Why can't we have a bad guy who isn't actually that bad
[2:33:53] <+Shadicara> So it's fucking Zeon? fantastic
[2:33:54] <$KwakuAnansi> Didn't Gaius help you in 1.0?
[2:33:55] <+Videodragon64> non-magic space hitlers
[2:33:58] <%Roasted_Pheasant> "There will be but one race. A perfect race. As we were when time began." - Garlean President
[2:34:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> So what you're saying is: Hitler was right all along???
[2:34:05] <+Mekhet09> In fact the fact that they didn't have magic made them very petty when they got technology.
[2:34:07] <%templar010> Gauis was the only cool Imperial. Maybe Nero
[2:34:08] <$jobbedbone> If I had to participate in one race war, it would probably be this one.
[2:34:08] <+Daleksek53> you are allowed two pets and no more
[2:34:10] <Maids4lyfe> cats bite to show affection and playfulness
[2:34:13] <ShichiNoBushi> He wants to devour you and absorb your essense.

[2:34:33] <CountMeowingtonn> My cat can't bite me cuz she had gum disease and only has like 10 teeth left. Still became a fat asshole
[2:34:34] <MC_GigglePants> Gaius is going super saiyan
[2:34:35] <absolute_cagemony> sounds like a good gf. asks for cuddles then starts torturing you.
[2:34:36] <Thalchampz> TOUGH QUESTION

[2:34:49] <%arknodem> Take breaks when needed
[2:34:50] <Daniel_Is_I> More buttons sooner.
[2:34:51] <suikudo> Not a godamn thing 2.0 is the casual filter
[2:34:51] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> I know they're techinally different styles of gunblades, but I still hope we can use Garlean gbs for Gunbreaker.
[2:34:51] <+Dessbocito2> LUL
[2:34:52] <%salty_syd913> yooooo
[2:34:53] <jackythefrost> Skimp down the quests between ARR and HW
[2:34:53] <%spiritofmojave> HW is tantalizing?

[2:34:54] <ShichiNoBushi> Is that a gun-blade?
[2:34:55] <Rhonne> Super saiyan!
[2:34:55] <%GarbageNirvana> Super Garlean
[2:34:56] <Angry_Ev1L> It's on devs to fix that shit
[2:34:59] <Bad1uck> @AngriestPat Woolie would just say that "pet me" signal you're getting is from the toxoplasmosis from Elmo's poop
[2:34:59] <ColRedyx> Pretty much just remake the quests.

[2:35:07] <+KSabot> REMOVE TAMTARA
[2:35:07] <%Fidranth> Gaius Requiem
[2:35:09] <Maids4lyfe> okay he literally went super saiyan, I should have expected that
[2:35:10] <%arknodem> Also, focus on MSQ
[2:35:10] <ReiDuran> Get rid of AURUM VALE
[2:35:11] <%LegendCobra> 80% of quests
[2:35:15] <+KalMyre> they need to trim down all the 50 quests.
[2:35:15] <+aslfrasle> I LOVE GOLD
[2:35:16] <bestwaifuritsu> @Shadicara You totally can. Theres a dbz power up emote.
[2:35:16] <zamzoph> This guy has a point :thinking:
[2:35:17] <%spiritofmojave> WHAT IF HE WERE GOLd
[2:35:17] <transporterthesequel> YEP
[2:35:21] <%Jamejarrs> Oh fuck yes

[2:35:29] <+alphonseisbest> YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS
[2:35:29] <%arknodem> lol. Forgot he turned gold.
[2:35:30] <%HiroTSK5> I just finished that one
[2:35:32] <xeros720> fuckin, excuse me?
[2:35:32] <%castcode> You walk into Titan's house and Titan is just holding the cheese
[2:35:32] <haveswordmuststing> yep
[2:35:32] <CybertronPrime> Oh yeah, Richard Epcar voices Gaius.
[2:35:32] <ShichiNoBushi> Patron in battle stance.
[2:35:33] <%Divryne> It was a joke on purpose though.
[2:35:33] <%wolfdude_120> Wait which one?
[2:35:34] <%arknodem> Oh for sure.
[2:35:36] <Daniel_Is_I> Wait what level is that questline?
[2:35:37] <speximillian> Why doesn’t Gunbreaker have Golden Freiza form like Gaius?
[2:35:37] <$Vilecrow> YES!!! hated that part
[2:35:38] <%Ser_Ser_Ser> fuck the cheese it was so bad
[2:35:41] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@alphonseisbest) (warning)
[2:35:41] <xeros720> is that to attune for hard titant?
[2:35:41] <$OmegaWeltall> i DISPISE the quest system in this game
[2:35:42] <%SoleilAstier> SoleilAstier subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[2:35:43] <%Nobrev> I forgot about that horrible stupid useless goblin cheese quest
[2:35:45] <%spiritofmojave> yeah fuck that line
[2:35:47] <HeadsHeldHigh> Gaius having a heated Garlean moment
[2:35:48] <%shadybarman> controller tutorial thats in game I'm still watching the last ff14 VOD to understand controller
[2:35:51] <transporterthesequel> It's so absurd, and takes SO LONG
[2:35:52] <jackythefrost> @AngriestPat Even worse than the 85 quests of filler between ARR and HW?
[2:35:56] <%wolfdude_120> It's been 4 years, which questline?
[2:35:56] <theobble> EORZEA BUY MY RICE
[2:36:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> CHEESE for everyone
[2:36:09] <transporterthesequel> It's the absurdity AND length that just fucks you up[
[2:36:09] <haveswordmuststing> after fighting FUCKING IFFRIT, they make you search for cheese to fight a dumb ogre
[2:36:16] <xeros720> oh, the goblin cheese
[2:36:16] <Daniel_Is_I> Wait is that the one that ends with the banquet??
[2:36:16] <TioXyco> ARR questline is kinda hit or miss, that quest in particular was a total miss
[2:36:20] <OrphixPride> is it just me or does the music sound weird???
[2:36:21] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Y'shtola constantly complains about how stupid that quest is all throughout it, it's great LUL
[2:36:23] <%spiritofmojave> gotta gorge Titan on cheese
[2:36:24] <$OmegaWeltall> "hello demi god walking the earth, could you grab my dirty laundry for me?"
[2:36:25] <speximillian> Goblin Cheese matters
[2:36:25] <zamzoph> How long is this elevator?
[2:36:26] <xeros720> and there's whole other dungeon
[2:36:29] <+Shadicara> Don't you want cheese for fighting titan pat Kappa
[2:36:30] <+Ryutaryi> It'll last 20 seconds in ShB, so you can hold it even longer.
[2:36:31] <+alphonseisbest> @jackythefrost no I hate titan quests way more
[2:36:32] <bestwaifuritsu> Quoting Pat from the old old video "This shit doesnt hurt just stand in it"
[2:36:36] <+Kurogane_Dread> rise of the White Raven is better than Bite of the Black Wolf
[2:36:38] <%CaptainKarite> THAT is where i am right now
[2:36:39] <ReiDuran> Ysale
[2:36:41] <%castcode> This fighting game elevator though
[2:36:42] <%SoleilAstier> SoleilAstier subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 4 months of my favorite ginger. Keeps doing what you do Pat.
[2:36:42] <%BlitzNeidhart> 85? It's 100 of them
[2:36:43] <+hierophant_sheen> But nobody can ever convince me that the Leviabeetus questline wasn't the best
[2:36:52] <+Shadicara> Crystal braves LUL
[2:36:54] <RubyPilot> @AngriestPat youll want to hold trick til right before aeolian edge in your second combo
[2:36:54] <%Ilpala> learning a bunch about eikons and ascians
[2:36:57] <%Divryne> 2.X sets up a lot of shit for SB.
[2:36:57] <%around_40_jobbers> I'm lost, cheese?
[2:36:58] <x3as> doma refuguees
[2:36:58] <KruelDestiny> I'm doing that right now
[2:36:58] <CybertronPrime> SLOPPEH
[2:36:58] <%Fidranth> @AngriestPat oh yeah, sorry for daisy-chaining you through this fight accidentally the first time you ran it. I was the MNK
[2:36:58] <pandangerous> crystal braves LUL
[2:37:03] <%Roasted_Pheasant> As someone whose last MMO was the Beta for Elder Scrolls Online (fucking yikes), this game looks badass.
[2:37:05] <xeros720> and you can do the Hildebrant quests, which are hilarious
[2:37:05] <suikudo> You get to meet Minfilia's mom
[2:37:06] <%spiritofmojave> Violin Kreygasm
[2:37:07] <indig0bird> It's a lot more interesting because maintaining the alliance is just as difficult as rallying
[2:37:10] <jackythefrost> @BlitzNeidhart The last 15 actually matters
[2:37:21] <Zepik> yeah that 100 quest 2.X spread is kinda rough but it picks up by the end, and then you get the hour and half movie at the end of it
[2:37:22] <%Darthwaffler> I know next to NOTHING about this game beyond the obvious FF stuff!
[2:37:25] <%Guardiansaiyan> !uptime
[2:37:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 37m.
[2:37:28] <+Kurogane_Dread> usually you want to do trick when your suiton is about to run out
[2:37:33] <indig0bird> No, you dumb fuck. You're not a better ruller because you can kick ass
[2:37:34] <@JustinianKnight> you ideally wanna squeeze in 2 AE in a Trick attack
[2:37:35] <$KwakuAnansi> @OrphixPride The full song has lyrics and is used in the lvl 50 8-man raid
[2:37:38] <GrandMazterNelson> Hi pat
[2:37:38] <Sydin18> Amen
[2:37:43] <CybertronPrime> F'laminn does more for the plot than Minfillia ever does.
[2:37:44] <GrandMazterNelson> Hi chat
[2:37:44] <pmtriox> keep mudra up, do trick attack as much as you can
[2:37:45] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> we already got our cataclysm
[2:37:47] <Maids4lyfe> what's cataclysm?
[2:37:50] <+RhymesWithWasabi> honestly
[2:37:52] <+Mekhet09> I wish they cleaned up crafting!!!!!!!!
[2:37:54] <Daniel_Is_I> @Maids4lyfe WoW expansion
[2:37:55] <+KalMyre> @Maids4lyfe the WoW expansion
[2:37:57] <pmtriox> don't redo the world again
[2:37:59] <$KwakuAnansi> Wow Cataclysm
[2:38:01] <%wolfdude_120> It's so fucking staggering how much 2.0 and the expansions differ in story quality
[2:38:01] <krymzen5> NEVER DO CATACLYSM as a old WoW fan
[2:38:02] <Maids4lyfe> ah, thank you
[2:38:04] <%spiritofmojave> no one wants a Cataclysm
[2:38:07] <%Roasted_Pheasant> A Realm Re-Reborn
[2:38:10] <%LegendCobra> explain cataclysm to those who dont know
[2:38:10] <%Owkono> second cataclysm
[2:38:10] <jackythefrost> @Maids4lyfe The WoW expansion that started the slow death of the game
[2:38:10] <Calek> the entire game drags if you skip cutscenes
[2:38:11] <%TheShal> The build up to Titan is slow, then Titan to Garuda is ALSO slow.
[2:38:11] <+Shadicara> Oh where all the old stuff changed?
[2:38:12] <%budyd> You beat the stuffing out of that man, and then he just walks away
[2:38:14] <speximillian> Cataclysm is when a giant dragon destroyed the world
[2:38:14] <%marsano168> the best part is that they cant do cataclyzm cause they already used that narrative lol
[2:38:16] <+talfurt> didnt ffxiv kinda already get a cataclysm
[2:38:17] <Psyramics> In Cataclysm, they completely redid all of the leveling zones
[2:38:21] <MC_GigglePants> Fat Cat is better
[2:38:22] <thwak> Cataclysm changed every single starting zone in WOW
[2:38:24] <%Roasted_Pheasant> I LOVE fat chocobo
[2:38:24] <Maids4lyfe> @jackythefrost I see, thank you
[2:38:26] <+MisterCrimson> Even Anthem players don't want Cataclysm
[2:38:26] <suikudo> Fuck you fat choco is best
[2:38:26] <%CaptainKarite> IF I can buy that fat chocobo I will
[2:38:27] <DaydreamDisaster> but what is cataclysm for those that dont know wow? @AngriestPat
[2:38:28] <pmtriox> we already had a cataclysm, and it worked out, don't need a second
[2:38:32] <AMaidIndeed> CHONKY BOI
[2:38:34] <+Mycalico> @AngriestPat Cataclysm Already happened Pat! It's called "A Realm Reborn" :P
[2:38:34] <%Roasted_Pheasant> MUHFUCKIN BAHAMUT?
[2:38:37] <Sydin18> It was worth it
[2:38:37] <%GarbageNirvana> It can also fly

[2:38:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Once you get to the flying bits
[2:38:46] <%budyd> 5$ for a foot long pat
[2:38:46] <+earthboy2k> comparing dumb video game shit to subway sandwiches
[2:38:47] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @AngriestPat A Realm Re-Reborn
[2:38:48] <$jobbedbone> METAL GEAR?!
[2:38:49] <+Shadicara> Yes it's gundam bahamut
[2:38:50] <%TheShal> I could not starve, or I can buy a digital fat chicken for my doll to ride on
[2:38:57] <bestwaifuritsu> @Roasted_Pheasant LUL Bahamut is in the game as an ARR Endgame raid
[2:39:00] <krymzen5> it's the turning point for wow imo
[2:39:00] <@PeachSaliva> lol pat is dumb
[2:39:09] <$jobbedbone> @PeachSaliva yes
[2:39:09] <+Deano8817> @PeachSaliva OOF

[2:45:42] <pandangerous> I am
[2:45:46] <ReiDuran> Even Alphinaud?
[2:45:46] <MC_GigglePants> The Story is probably the only reason I'm willing to play this since I hate MMOs
[2:45:46] <kanodin> trusts might make it easier to go unspoiled
[2:45:47] <+Shadicara> Time to nuke the hero
[2:45:48] <%Spydurman> @AngriestPat you enjoy their RACE WAR?
[2:45:50] <+StrawberryPantsu> XIV's story is good

[2:45:52] <ittla> @AngriestPat Lyse is best girl
[2:45:55] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Azarian1) (warning)
[2:45:56] <%spiritofmojave> It is pretty solid
[2:45:56] <Daniel_Is_I> I play this game and I don't know who the fuck this is
[2:46:01] <ssks123> remember when Heavensward was coming out and the story was getting super real?
[2:46:02] <+oOZtkOo> who knew ultima weapon would cast ultima
[2:46:02] <ShichiNoBushi> A tiger?
[2:46:03] <@PeachSaliva> I'm into that ass for the story.
[2:46:04] <ColRedyx> @budyd These days, jRPGs don't have good stories, but they used to and this game resembles those days. What you're seeing is not part of that great story, it gets way, WAY better a while after this scene.
[2:46:05] <%budyd> Fair enough
[2:46:07] <+DrunkenDice> D:
[2:46:08] <@ThePlotHole> Damn

[2:46:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oops, all burnt
[2:46:50] <%Voidwyvern> PLD gets shield at 30 now
[2:46:50] <+KalMyre> @thedannydarko i wont object if you think Hildribrand is best boi Kappa
[2:46:51] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Rise is the worst because she doesn't respect it when you aren't dating her.
[2:46:52] <%wolfdude_120> BABY
[2:46:53] <OrphixPride> you actually get your tank stance at 30 now for paladin

[2:47:55] <LandOfTheWay> final boss music PogChamp
[2:47:57] <%Mekhet09> Mekhet09 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:47:58] <+Azarian1> Curious how much extra dialogue DRK's are going to get in ShB
[2:48:00] <Prism_Wing> Your adventuring days are coming to an end! lytUSEGUN
[2:48:03] <PsychedelicSamurai> I love this song
[2:48:05] <pmtriox> "super being"
[2:48:12] <%TenderBabyBacon> The more you shake the bag, then money falls out
[2:48:13] <RupanSen> burn burn burn, the ring of fire, the ring of fiiiire
[2:48:19] <CountMeowingtonn> y'shtola changes jobs in ShB
[2:48:21] <+Ell1ot> i don't like it when MMO's go, "You! the chosen one!" does that happen in this game?
[2:48:23] <%Taisuru> Thancred
[2:48:23] <%templar010> In ShB every has new jobs
[2:48:27] <%CaptainKarite> Thancred does right?
[2:48:29] <@PeachSaliva> ELMO
[2:48:29] <%AncelDeLambert> oh so it's Dress Sphere bs?
[2:48:32] <%castcode> Thancred does the thing
[2:48:32] <jackythefrost> Y'shtola goes from White Mage to Black Mage
[2:48:33] <+oOZtkOo> thancred is a gunbreaker now
[2:48:35] <CountMeowingtonn> Thancred goes from thief to gunbreaker
[2:48:36] <%spiritofmojave> Y'shtola, Thacred
[2:48:37] <pmtriox> thankred has 3 times i think
[2:48:39] <%TheShal> Ditch that WHM trash become as you must. BEST MAGE BLM
[2:48:39] <MC_GigglePants> Thancred finds a whole new job
[2:48:40] <GarbageQueenEllie> "Chosen One!" "I'm coming!"
[2:48:41] <ReiDuran> There's a guy in StB who is apparently really important with that white face paint right?
[2:48:45] <Zepik> Urianger put's on a nighty and becomes an Astro
[2:48:56] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Hell, one of them gets a job that wasn't available at the time
[2:49:02] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Peck
[2:49:08] <bestwaifuritsu> I think is cute that Alisaie is wearing more red in SHB
[2:49:11] <%OdysseyKnight> and why you can fight Primals and not get enslaved
[2:49:12] <pmtriox> and teleport, and resurrect
[2:49:12] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat so your character is an Isekai protag
[2:49:13] <%AquilaHarukaze> The extra layer of spoilers in long things like MMOs is the very MENTION of a character being in later content makes any risk towards them anywhere in between, nullified.
[2:49:15] <LandOfTheWay> it's more like spidey sense than anything
[2:49:16] <SailingSaturn> and you're immune to Tempering(Brainwashing)
[2:49:19] <ScreamingMeat> Job Crystals are Basically Futurama Career Chips
[2:49:22] <theobble> The tiers of power according to Yoshida (actual quote) * < Raubahn < Ilberd < WoL < Guts
[2:49:22] <+Karasseram> the echo does lots of stuff
[2:49:23] <Animal_Farm4> It's not seeing the future it's "echoing" someone else's soul
[2:49:23] <+Zepshire> wiping in a boss is the echo
[2:49:25] <+Silentman0> most job crystals have the memories of its former owners magically imbued in it (but not blue mages because fuck them)
[2:49:27] <+KalMyre> @Ell1ot basically, yes. but the game references that you are not the only one.
[2:49:32] <%spiritofmojave> Echo shows my damage numbers Kappa
[2:49:33] <thetyrantcbass> I think the only one explicitly locked out to other NPCs is WHM, Shtola is technically just a super strong conjurer
[2:49:34] <%Taisuru> That would be so fucking stupid
[2:49:38] <%crimsonharvest> Isekai but its the same sekai
[2:49:38] <Mastigias> Come shadowbrings, YES
[2:49:39] <%blastazoid26> @angriestpat Hey pat did you see that Square put all of the Final Fantasy soundtracks on Spotify? Everything's there.
[2:49:41] <ShichiNoBushi> If you want to RP that.
[2:49:42] <LandOfTheWay> @AngriestPat there's actually a ffxiv isekai manga
[2:49:44] <%Taisuru> I would drop this game in an instant if it became and isakai
[2:49:45] <RupanSen> Is your character a Kirito?
[2:49:53] <+KSabot> can't even get to the best part of the song
[2:49:53] <haisho> just find someone to be an Aqua
[2:49:57] <Angry_Ev1L> isekai protagonists are your enemies Kappa
[2:49:59] <+KalMyre> @Ell1ot the game basically says like "multiple warriors of light" which is other players and NPCs
[2:50:01] <bestwaifuritsu> PaThEtIC
[2:50:01] <%crimsonharvest> You got reincarnated into an isekai but its the same world and all you got to keep was your xp
[2:50:01] <+KSabot> they need to retune that f ight
[2:50:03] <+griffball13> HOW CAN THIS BE
[2:50:04] <pmtriox> Gaius is best girl
[2:50:05] <theobble> LIQUID
[2:50:09] <Goldenwolf98> I wanna play an MMO where my character is literally just another shlub who does nothing special in the grand scheme of this but just is good at fighting and stuff LUL
[2:50:09] <x3as> @blastazoid26 yeah it was mentioned a little while ago
[2:50:10] <+oOZtkOo> are we an isekai since we're going to the First?
[2:50:11] <%OdysseyKnight> Knocked the Super Saiyan out of him
[2:50:14] <tsuchi7> beat the sayan outta him
[2:50:15] <%Mekhet09> I hope shadowbringers doesn't have the same issue stormblood did where you had one area and then weeb town and no one gave a shit about the other area or their plight.
[2:50:15] <ColRedyx> Yeah... that fight ends before the good part of the song kicks in now
[2:50:15] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat Ultimate Weapon looks like Guyver and I like that
[2:50:18] <ReiDuran> MUST NEEDS
[2:50:20] <%Owkono> Is it Isekai if you believe you are in the game?
[2:50:20] <%TenderBabyBacon> Buttpats give him the big pepis
[2:50:29] <%budyd> Do you play warframe for the story? If so, do you prefer this to warframe? Or do they scratch different itches?
[2:50:31] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat but we don't know what a phone or picture is, from Noctis's visit LUL
[2:50:34] <+Zepshire> technically we are being transported into another world so it is an isekai
[2:50:42] <%crimsonharvest> Listen Baelsar, if your dumb philosophy is correct then you are objectively not fit to lead.
[2:50:48] <Angry_Ev1L> said zodiark's puppet LUL
[2:50:51] <seeesah> hi pat! finally caught your stream ;o;
[2:50:53] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat What races (and gender) do you see as too many or too few in population? I heard that potatoes are overwhelmingly popular in Japan.
[2:50:55] <Goldenwolf98> Noctis is the best Isekai Protag Kappa
[2:50:59] <+Shadicara> Army of bunny girls LUL
[2:51:00] <%GarbageNirvana> DRK getting a stand is pretty cool
[2:51:04] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@StrawberryPantsu)
[2:51:06] <+Silentman0> @SailingSaturn tomestones are essentially phones
[2:51:07] <%Fidranth> I can't believe he's dead
[2:51:07] <%GarbageNirvana> Or clone or whatevs
[2:51:09] <mr_hunter> Man I can't believe Gaius is fucking dead
[2:51:10] <+alphonseisbest> @angriestpat so since the echo is what allows us to fight the primals, in this fight the echo is gone, could a primal have brainwashed us if they got summoned here?
[2:51:15] <Tucker0603> I hat that
[2:51:18] <%Guardiansaiyan> Isn't this a Final Fantasy X boss? Secret Boss??
[2:51:24] <%spiritofmojave> Reminder Gaius just buffed that off
[2:51:26] <%Shady_Squid> f
[2:51:27] <%OdysseyKnight> Totally dead
[2:51:28] <RubyPilot> hes dead forever
[2:51:28] <+Karasseram> alphonseisbest the echo is not gone
[2:51:28] <SailingSaturn> @Silentman0 remember don't Tomestone and Drive cirBaka

[2:51:29] <%Divryne> Or DID HE?!
[2:51:31] <RubyPilot> hes fucking dead
[2:51:32] <+Shadicara> I'm looking forward to the bunny apocalypse
[2:51:32] <Zepik> and we'll never see him again
[2:51:34] <%crimsonharvest> oh no ultima caused a hole in the ground, how terrifying

[2:51:54] <Angry_Ev1L> He'll be dead in the next cuutscene
[2:51:56] <ColRedyx> @alphonseisbest The WoL didn't lose the Echo, they had an extra blessing of light on top of that. Like a surge of power coming directly from Hydaelyn.
[2:51:56] <%chad_irl> The mitochondria
[2:51:58] <+alphonseisbest> @karasseram it is super weakened tho
[2:51:58] <%TheWinged7> A weapon to surpass Metal Gear?

[2:52:00] <SailingSaturn> Lahabread cirSlain
[2:52:03] <%crimsonharvest> Ultima as a spell made its debut in Final Fantasy 2, where it was bugged to never gain power.
[2:52:05] <+oOZtkOo> @AngriestPat SCH quests are pretty cool, i got to hang out with tonberrys
[2:52:09] <+Karasseram> alphonseisbest no its not
[2:52:11] <%Guardiansaiyan> @kingdovachief Hello! barlLove
[2:52:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> Wow, he sounds like a total loser
[2:52:18] <jackythefrost> The only good ones are DRK, BLM and DRG when it comes to job quests @AngriestPat
[2:52:19] <%OdysseyKnight> All the way until the end of 3.0
[2:52:22] <Goldenwolf98> Hes seems kinda shit as a villain
[2:52:22] <%MyDarkStorm> He A Bitch
[2:52:22] <transporterthesequel> He get's got REAL HARD
[2:52:23] <%TheShal> BLM quests were about the power of love and friendship, granting us explosions
[2:52:24] <+Shadicara> Good I love a jobber to smack around
[2:52:28] <raindog23> shame he's so boring
[2:52:29] <bestwaifuritsu> Ascian Prime is fuckin dope though
[2:52:32] <%allouttajuice> @AngriestPat should I get into ff14 now or just wait for the expac with the big combat changes? I'm only gonna be able to play for an hour or two at best a day until late june so idk if it's worth learning the game now only to have it completely turn over before I even finish the current content
[2:52:34] <%Nobrev> this next fight is just a victory lap
[2:52:35] <+Karasseram> alphonseisbest the proection of the crystals and the echo are two different things
[2:52:35] <%Roasted_Pheasant> He's basically Roman Reigns
[2:52:39] <+alphonseisbest> @karasseram the game just showed that is was tho
[2:52:39] <SailingSaturn> @jackythefrost I liked my Goldsmith quests cirISee
[2:52:41] <%castcode> monkaS
[2:52:42] <Angry_Ev1L> HYdaelyn sucks ass too
[2:52:44] <%AncelDeLambert> @TheShal no wonder they suck
[2:52:44] <thetyrantcbass> This is suddenly very relevant!
[2:52:45] <+MisterCrimson> Elidibus is much better since he also has a point like Gaius did
[2:52:46] <Nina96> @AngriestPat whats the name of the "fuck me eyes" guy?
[2:52:47] <TioXyco> imagine Lahabrea being an ally in ShB, because... you know, Warrior of Darkness
[2:52:55] <+Ell1ot> twitch gave me 30 days of ff14 a few months ago. i turned the game back on and now i'm confused
[2:52:56] <%GarbageNirvana> Listen to this evil voice acting
[2:53:00] <%AquilaHarukaze> Aymeric!
[2:53:00] <Quietshun13> Aymeric
[2:53:01] <+caffeinomancer> @Nina96 Aymeric
[2:53:05] <jackythefrost> BLM Job Quests: "Hey Kid, YOU WANT TO JOIN OUT SATANIC CULT!!??"
[2:53:09] <haisho> literally Ansem
[2:53:13] <%TheShal> @AncelDeLambert As apposed to what? BLM is the best job
[2:53:16] <transporterthesequel> Also he falls victim to ALSO being almost right
[2:53:16] <Angry_Ev1L> when zodiark will tell us that all this order 13 goobers have nothing to do with him lol?
[2:53:19] <%OdysseyKnight> Aymeric
[2:53:19] <Goldenwolf98> Just beat him up while he monologues
[2:53:20] <%marsano168> Mister Aymeric I think you are trying to seduce me.......
[2:53:25] <+Kurogane_Dread> Ser Aymeric de Borel
[2:53:26] <+Fynale> eye...meric
[2:53:28] <+CashWolf> ???
[2:53:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> goTtA FiNd tHoSe eMeRalDSss
[2:53:29] <%Divryne> I'm Eric.
[2:53:29] <%spiritofmojave> Eyemeric LUL
[2:53:29] <CopperTucker> Aymeric de Borel
[2:53:30] <%kewlmyc> I'm Eric?
[2:53:31] <+RhymesWithWasabi> eye meric????
[2:53:32] <+reiju_22> I'm eric
[2:53:32] <%Taisuru> Actually pronounced Eh Mercic
[2:53:32] <indig0bird> He's a bro
[2:53:36] <%Jamejarrs> apatWrong
[2:53:36] <%Laecerelius> He's the best
[2:53:37] <mastermidget23> Maybe you should have joined the fight while Ultima Weapon was still around, ya chode.
[2:53:38] <+Fynale> it's ayyy meric
[2:53:39] <+RushUnplugged> there's 2 type of people in the world, people that love Aymeric and LIARS
[2:53:40] <+Fynale> ....
[2:53:40] <ColRedyx> Emmer-ick
[2:53:40] <+KSabot> Ayyymeric
[2:53:41] <%Nobrev> you pronounced that name super bad
[2:53:42] <@JustinianKnight> Eh-Mer-ick
[2:53:42] <%CaptainKarite> I looked him up and yep, I see it
[2:53:43] <%Guardiansaiyan> Yu Yevon really bulked up!
[2:53:46] <RupanSen> Fuck me eyes, not to be confused with fuck you eyes
[2:53:48] <SailingSaturn> also known as Baemeric cirISee
[2:53:53] <+alphonseisbest> @angriestpat so since the echo is what allows us to fight the primals, in this fight the echo is weakened , could a primal have brainwashed us if they got summoned here?
[2:53:54] <$KwakuAnansi> @AngriestPat Remember Paladin's Shounen tournament arc questline in SB?
[2:53:57] <%AncelDeLambert> so this guy powers up when he becomes Papillon from Busou Renkin?
[2:53:58] <+KalMyre> Baemeric Kreygasm
[2:54:00] <%Taisuru> He deserves better pat
[2:54:02] <HeadsHeldHigh> Aymeric wants you inside him.
[2:54:04] <%Taisuru> He loves you
[2:54:07] <Animal_Farm4> Thanks Crystal Mom!
[2:54:07] <Zepik> it's bad when you instantly know it's Aymeric from the phrase "fuck me eyes"
[2:54:07] <ReiDuran> Aymeric is the rebound lay from Haurchefant.
[2:54:12] <ColRedyx> @allouttajuice If you pre-order you'll get a nice little earring that will help you level faster. Most jobs aren't changing a ton either. Otherwise you can just play the trial for free up to level 35 now and buy the complete edition after Shadowbringers comes out.
[2:54:13] <Sydin18> Mama light
[2:54:17] <%GarbageNirvana> Thanks for the crystal juice
[2:54:20] <%Darthwaffler> Edgelord mystic babble intensifies!
[2:54:21] <%Ser_Ser_Ser> Aymeric is a sad boi
[2:54:23] <%CaptainKarite> He a bitch
[2:54:27] <Rhonne> look at that life bar go
[2:54:28] <bestwaifuritsu> Aymeric is hot and all but have you SEEN Estiniens...lance ~ ♥
[2:54:29] <SailingSaturn> Remember chat Hien > Aymeric cirIsee
[2:54:30] <Fuji_Apples> is pat farming tomestones and lvling ninja?
[2:54:33] <SailingSaturn> cirISee
[2:54:34] <+Kurogane_Dread> LahabreaA

[2:54:44] <%castcode> oh my god

[2:54:51] <+Silentman0> well then
[2:54:52] <Swish19XX> So does the story get better? I just hit Heavensward (Finally) and I'm so tired of traitors and stuff
[2:54:55] <%allouttajuice> @ColRedyx I already pre-ordered as I played years ago and had the account and I want to tank as a GNB, it's a matter of is it really worth it if I can't play consistently until the new expac is out
[2:54:56] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat you got irregular tomes for the moogle event
[2:54:56] <HeadsHeldHigh> Fuck off Ascian punk
[2:54:57] <%Roasted_Pheasant> "You're an immortal god force of darkness? Well... I CAN THROW KNIVES." - Pat, Probably
[2:55:00] <+Shadicara> how many levels did you get pat?
[2:55:04] <%castcode> man they really just slapped him and walked off
[2:55:07] <+Silentman0> @Swish19XX you're at the point where it gets good
[2:55:08] <Zepik> yay poetics, now you can buy a weapon that;s not trash
[2:55:09] <bestwaifuritsu> Oh look there I am dancing again

[2:56:02] <%Fallen_270> @AngriestPat I was idiot and bought the steam version a while back, should I just accept the loss and buy stormblood to play heavensward since I cant get it for free before shadowbringers?
[2:56:02] <@mothmandraws> jsut beat 2nd maelstrom hunting log and got sergeant 2nd class
[2:56:02] <%crimsonharvest> Why is it gold saucer music in here, proximity to the cactus?

[2:56:15] <%MyDarkStorm> Has anyone notice Yodhi P. Is Dreading the Early Access of Shadow Bringer
[2:56:15] <RupanSen> is this the Gold Saucer soundtrack?
[2:56:20] <+KSabot> flip
[2:56:20] <ColRedyx> @allouttajuice If your time is that limited then probably not worth resubbing yet, but if you KNOW you definitely want to play Shadowbringers I'd order it a few days before launch for the bonuses and early access.
[2:56:25] <Ultimatefool> Look at this goofy Ninja jump flip
[2:56:32] <%crimsonharvest> its gonna be ravana
[2:56:39] <mastermidget23> @Silentman0 DUUUUUDE. If you'd have told me I'd be legitimately upset to see HER go...

[2:57:00] <%Fidranth> I legitimately don't remember king mog, it's been so long
[2:57:01] <Swish19XX> @Bad1uck Damn, I'm fucking hyped now! Dark Knight quest was pretty strong
[2:57:03] <%allouttajuice> @ColRedyx like I said I already did pre-order it in anticipation, and I do enjoy what I have played of it before so thanks for the input.

[2:57:54] <LovableEgg> sofieS
[2:57:54] <%Darthwaffler> Pats character is reminding me of Woolie's toothpick giant.
[2:57:56] <%ecolli37108> Pat come bless this plot so i can get it
[2:57:57] <Tucker0603> it's the stalker cat
[2:58:09] <RoboXGP> the Fromsoft game with GRmartin is real!
[2:58:12] <$Valdorick> Stream numbers will never be higher, but Pat will end the FF14 streams... because of the sniping.
[2:58:14] <Prism_Wing> It's just like that game, Remember Me
[2:58:14] <bestwaifuritsu> Im not stalking, im manderville bombing
[2:58:23] <zamzoph> Pat's getting toxic, surely
[2:58:25] <xeros720> in your house, ruining your streams
[2:58:26] <%allouttajuice> @AngriestPat there's something weird about a giant being a stealthy ninja. Their hide should turn them into a tree instead of invisible
[2:58:32] <%GarbageNirvana> Someone's got bosses to do still
[2:58:34] <Wigglebottom_> @Kekon3 kittyzKiss
[2:58:36] <%TheShal> One of you hasn't finished all the trials.

[2:58:44] <Angry_Ev1L> @RoboXGP we knew it was real the moment GRRM said he worked with japanese game studio
[2:58:49] <Swish19XX> @Bad1uck Literally just the intro quest. I was so ready for the bloodlust after that last questline

[2:59:38] <$shurtal> Dat's a big booty
[2:59:39] <mastermidget23> Everytime a SUPER GIANT character is stealthy, I just imagine it's less about sneaking around and more ominously getting in people's faces and going "YOU. SAW. NOTHING."
[2:59:41] <TheEvilOmega> It's crazy fun. Hildebrand quests are the best.
[2:59:41] <MC_GigglePants> That's a BIG BRIDGE!

[3:00:34] <indig0bird> Think again!
[3:00:40] <GarbageQueenEllie> @ColRedyx Ah, I see. It all makes sense now
[3:00:42] <+RushUnplugged> the name of the track for Gilgamesh fights since FF5 is "Battle on the Big Bridge"
[3:00:43] <IndoorSitup> G I R U G A M E S H
[3:00:48] <%maskedriderhero> we trusted you
[3:00:49] <Bad1uck> Greg is also in FF6
[3:00:49] <+Fynale> adds in a trial?
[3:00:51] <%umbypokochan> i did a quest today that had a GoT reference... i almost threw up
[3:00:53] <jackythefrost> Gilgamesh is one of the many wonderful things to come from FF5
[3:00:53] <Sunstalker> @AngriestPat I can't believe Beat Takeshi killed all those people over a game of Battleship. rooD
[3:00:57] <+MisterCrimson> he's the best Dorkass
[3:01:01] <Rhonne> Greg is one of my favorite side characters
[3:01:02] <%Roasted_Pheasant> I really wish this Gilgamesh was voiced by Bender still
[3:01:03] <%crimsonharvest> This song is an arrangement of Battle On The Big Bridge but it's also a cover of the Black Mages version of the song
[3:01:03] <Kekon3> We love Greg
[3:01:05] <bestwaifuritsu> @ anyone who doesnt do Hildibrand quests, GO DO THEM
[3:01:05] <+Karasseram> poor greg he thought he had Nael's gunlance but it was jsut a ripoff
[3:01:08] <goofywizard> Hey guys! Im looking into getting FFXIV, i like playing range or melee dps, what class would yall suggest?
[3:01:08] <%MyDarkStorm> GREG You Coward
[3:01:13] <%Nobrev> Greg has been in almost every FF game since his first appearance
[3:01:13] <ColRedyx> @Bad1uck Was that ever proven? I've known about that theory forever but it's always debated.
[3:01:14] <+Ell1ot> i have the ff14 free trial. If i want to commit, do i have to buy the base game and all the expansions?
[3:01:16] <Kekon3> ARR Trials LUL
[3:01:17] <nsDrummer> lots of trials have adds
[3:01:18] <%budyd> How does Gilgamesh = Greg?
[3:01:19] <GypsySquid> If you have no idea, for the love of all things, play the Hildibrand questline.
[3:01:20] <Bad1uck> Adds here are to build up job guages
[3:01:27] <%D33TR> Greg or Jimmy, who is better
[3:01:29] <+KalMyre> @Ell1ot only base game and latest expansions
[3:01:31] <Bad1uck> It's to prepare for upcoming fights
[3:01:31] <nsDrummer> suzaku has adds
[3:01:33] <%GarbageNirvana> Hildibrand quests are bonkers
[3:01:36] <TheEvilOmega> He's Greg because Hildebrand willed it so.
[3:01:38] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Remember when Greg was voiced by Bender? That shit was hype.
[3:01:39] <+Azarian1> The best quest lines
[3:01:40] <ReiDuran> Hildibrand is super good
[3:01:45] <jackythefrost> @Ell1ot Yep pretty much. Buying the latest expansion gives you all the previous ones tho
[3:01:45] <%spiritofmojave> Play Hildebrand quests if you've finished ARR
[3:01:45] <nsDrummer> zurvan has adds
[3:01:45] <%Divryne> Hildabrand is the abridged version of FFXIV.
[3:01:46] <+SlowLikeThunder> It's a goofy shit questline and I love that that translates to the bosses too
[3:01:46] <GypsySquid> They're works of art.
[3:01:47] <ColRedyx> @Ell1ot Only the base game and the latest expansion, or the complete edition. The latest expansion always comes with all the expansions before it.

[3:02:20] <%umbypokochan> i can't beat gilgamesh in lord of verminion :(
[3:02:20] <mastermidget23> @goofywizard Summoner is great at ranged dps, black mage is a little more restrictive in movement but still fun. Once you get a few levels in, Ninja, Pats current class, is very fun.
[3:02:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> Go Greeeeg
[3:02:24] <%spiritofmojave> Hildebrand "SFM meme man" Mandy
[3:02:24] <+KalMyre> @Ell1ot but with shadowbringers you have to wait for its release until you get the other expannsions I think, not sure. but you only need to buy base game and latest expansion

[3:04:26] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat What races (and gender) do you see as too many or too few in population? I heard that potatoes are overwhelmingly popular in Japan.
[3:04:27] <Kekon3> Dude, I can never go back now that I have my 70 skills
[3:04:27] <+midnightq2> In shadowbringer, will you still be able to do the old job quests?
[3:04:32] <+Ell1ot> i like the giant chicken robots
[3:04:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hype
[3:04:37] <mastermidget23> @goofywizard If you like movement and ranged, I'd say either go Bard, or Summoner. Bard will do -less- damage, but has a ton of support abilities for groups. Summoner is all around very good, although with Shadowbringers changing stuff a bit, I can't speak for the future, but it looks like it'll be solid still. Do you like constant, steady damage or big ass bursts?
[3:04:40] <%allouttajuice> @AngriestPat when ShB i'm planning on starting, would you recommend PLD or WAR as a starting player's tank?
[3:04:43] <%MyDarkStorm> i have Yet to do hildebrand Quest
[3:04:44] <Bad1uck> @haisho Avoid the inn there at ALL COSTS
[3:04:44] <+blackkanye> Just got DRK to 70 and HOH BLM up for its last lvl to 70. Then WAR and MCH. Then maybe AST/WHM?
[3:04:46] <Estufu> look at dat naruto
[3:04:46] <jackythefrost> @midnightq2 Yep all the old content will still be there
[3:04:49] <+blackkanye> GAh so much lvling
[3:04:54] <+midnightq2> thanks
[3:05:14] <IndoorSitup> @angriestpat How do I cope with how badly SCH is about to be shafted and how boring it'll be to play? pls answer
[3:05:14] <ColRedyx> Trying to play WAR without Inner Release is just the worst blue balling.
[3:05:16] <+MisterCrimson> @allouttajuice PLD is good if you're into mitigation and fancy stuff, but WAR is big unga
[3:05:22] <%castcode> what
[3:05:22] <goofywizard> @mastermidget23 burst damage!
[3:05:26] <%MegboyManuel> POP the rabbit!
[3:05:29] <tsuchi7> dont forget party DPS, not only self dps
[3:05:34] <+Vruet> the worst was probably heavensward BLM going back to level 50

[3:06:03] <Kekon3> Ayyy, Stone Vigil aint that bad
[3:06:04] <+MisterCrimson> @allouttajuice PLD is the more complex one
[3:06:04] <+reiju_22> :)
[3:06:04] <%shadybarman> @AngriestPat on the last FF14 stream you did it looked like the house was in a diffrent location to where it is now, dose it's location change?
[3:06:05] <TioXyco> so, each week Pat gonna play as each role, right? when's ranged dps day?
[3:06:05] <GypsySquid> It's pretty.
[3:06:06] <Kekon3> only bad if you're the healer
[3:06:07] <%spiritofmojave> Nice roll!
[3:06:07] <Bad1uck> @blackkanye Skip AST until they figure out how to unfuck it later in ShB
[3:06:08] <Thalchampz> Vigil is so cool
[3:06:08] <zepelinnn> CRIT CITY
[3:06:09] <MC_GigglePants> Stone Vigil is cool
[3:06:09] <Fuji_Apples> stone vigil's the shit for squadron dungeons
[3:06:10] <%MegboyManuel> Stone Vigil is good, NOW WALL TO WALL
[3:06:10] <bestwaifuritsu> Stone Vigil is kino
[3:06:11] <@mothmandraws> ill alt tab out
[3:06:11] <RutlerTheButler> @AngriestPat do trick attack before gust slash instead of after, should still be able to fit in 2 of the final attack
[3:06:12] <Naho_Saenoki> mintyfLURK
[3:06:14] <Basch71> stone vigil's cool
[3:06:14] <nsDrummer> at least its not stone vigil hard
[3:06:16] <+blackkanye> @Bad1uck oh yeah true
[3:06:16] <zepelinnn> brace for CRITS
[3:06:17] <%Darthwaffler> he he... duty
[3:06:17] <$Valdorick> Oh yeah, I remember this place, this is agreat dungeon.
[3:06:20] <Edible_Enthusiasm> ehh. Stone Vigil HM was better
[3:06:21] <+HelloImTom08> Vigil is liek the only good pre 50 dungoen
[3:06:27] <nsDrummer> with that dumb armored turtle
[3:06:27] <Zepik> oh look it's my DRK from 41-50 dungeon
[3:06:33] <%allouttajuice> @blackkanye I'm playing this game to weab out, literally GNB is the weabiest tank
[3:06:33] <Calek> first time I did this dungeon I got stuck with a tank who couldn't hold aggro and told me to stop DPSing as a healer because I was screwing him up
[3:06:35] <%FreyRune> on the bright side, you get a free mog tomestone for clearing stone vigil
[3:06:38] <azure_king_drac> what level is he
[3:06:41] <bestwaifuritsu> oh look its that place I spammed Squadron missions in
[3:06:52] <$jobbedbone> I hate that generic zoom sound effect
[3:06:56] <%allouttajuice> @MisterCrimson so would you recommend PLD to learn the role better than?
[3:06:59] <cirticalexistencefailure> Ive done to many stone vigils
[3:07:05] <copyritetm> it's been like a million years since i'ver seen ARR dungeons
[3:07:08] <+blackkanye> @allouttajuice I just like FF8 and gunblades been wanting this since ARR
[3:07:10] <+MisterCrimson> @allouttajuice yes
[3:07:14] <%TheShal> A BLM without Flare is a sad BLM indeed
[3:07:16] <mastermidget23> @goofywizard After my own heart. Well you'll never get burstier range than a black mage, but you've got to be careful because almost all their abilities have a cast time that makes you stand still during it. But boy howdy you hit hard when those spells go off. The only class that's going to really edge you out on dps is potentially Samurai, but you can't play them until waaaaaay late in the game. Not that they're better, it's got it's own ups and downs.
[3:07:22] <%allouttajuice> @MisterCrimson thank you for the input
[3:07:26] <%MegboyManuel> Stone Vigil is solid
[3:07:27] <%allouttajuice> @blackkanye fair
[3:07:28] <Basch71> I did Stone Vigil alot during pre-HW
[3:07:28] <Tucker0603> same
[3:07:31] <MC_GigglePants> I've healed so many garbage tanks in this dungeon
[3:07:31] <Amplificate> What server does Pat play on or does he choose to keep it anonymous?
[3:07:31] <+blackkanye> And I havne't even finished FF8 LUL
[3:07:38] <bestwaifuritsu> the green Dragoon spear is pretty dope, its got a fucking dragon on it
[3:07:41] <%FreyRune> nah m8, Aurum vale is best dungeon
[3:07:42] <%MegboyManuel> I keep getting Stone Vigil for Roulettes
[3:07:45] <%GarbageNirvana> I wonder if they nerfed this dungeon at some point, I remember it being a lot harder
[3:07:48] <%TheShal> Dagrons
[3:07:51] <+MisterCrimson> @allouttajuice WAR survival is dependent on your only two Role Action CDs and how good your healer is
[3:07:51] <%MegboyManuel> FUCK Aurm Vale
[3:07:54] <$jobbedbone> DAR GONS
[3:07:57] <AMaidIndeed> DARGONS
[3:07:58] <%GarbageNirvana> Aurum Vale still sucks of course
[3:07:58] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Yeah, all the ARR dungeons got nerfed
[3:08:05] <%Darthwaffler> Dragons are +20 to cool
[3:08:09] <%Lapinelis> Good morning pat.
[3:08:10] <Basch71> Deathblossom + Bloodbath is the best
[3:08:11] <%MegboyManuel> Aurum Vale can suck a fat dong, GOD.
[3:08:15] <%allouttajuice> @MisterCrimson question is come ShB will that change or not
[3:08:19] <+reiju_22> PokPikachu
[3:08:22] <+Kavtech> @MegboyManuel I love Aurum Vale and feel inulted. How dare you not like what I like.
[3:08:26] <xmetalicdemonx> This is a dumb question but does this game have voice chat? Whenever I see people play nobody is talking.
[3:08:28] <%allouttajuice> Cause the combat changes for tanks when level seem pretty big @MisterCrimson
[3:08:32] <thetyrantcbass> Imagine the happy day when TP is gone and you can deathblossom forever
[3:08:37] <ColRedyx> @goofywizard If you want burst, range, and mobility, MCH and DNC when that comes out are your best bets.
[3:08:41] <%AFoolishPaper> AFoolishPaper subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:08:42] <+MisterCrimson> @allouttajuice not really, just passives and a loss of buttons
[3:08:43] <%MegboyManuel> @Kavtech you should be ashamed of liking Aurum Vale ya chode
[3:08:48] <%spiritofmojave> @xmetalicdemonx nope! it's purely text less you use discord
[3:08:55] <Bad1uck> @MisterCrimson Nope, Inner Beast has 20% dmg reduction for 50 beast guage
[3:08:57] <Basch71> the fact Deathblossom's a part of an aoe combo in ShB PogChamp
[3:08:59] <%FreyRune> @thetyrantcbass inb4 it uses mp lol
[3:08:59] <+KalMyre> Hildibrand PogChamp
[3:09:02] <%allouttajuice> @MisterCrimson getting tank stance at ten and aoe not tied to TP seems pretty big imo from what I've read
[3:09:03] <Nina96> how long is the msq? @AngriestPat
[3:09:06] <+Kavtech> @MegboyManuel What's wrong with Aurum Vale?
[3:09:06] <xmetalicdemonx> @spiritofmojave even on console?
[3:09:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat i have a dumb question, how do you switch between the squares in the HUD alteration screen with a controller? im stuck ;-;
[3:09:09] <thetyrantcbass> Noo

[3:09:15] <goofywizard> @mastermidget23 Thats gonna be my pick. Can you tell me more about melee dps. Sorry im asking you alot of questions lol. I haven't tocuhed WoW for over a year, and FFXIV has been on my rader!
[3:09:15] <%umbypokochan> omg you haven't seen Wolf Burglar???
[3:09:16] <nsDrummer> warring triad

[3:09:19] <nsDrummer> four lords
[3:09:26] <%umbypokochan> it's the longest thing ever
[3:09:35] <@mothmandraws> im at 2nd boss and tis taken me like 14 hours of streaming
[3:09:35] <%spiritofmojave> @xmetalicdemonx good question, think PS4 voice chat only
[3:09:36] <%Divryne> 50 hours for like 2.0.
[3:09:36] <+MisterCrimson> @allouttajuice yep. It is going to make tanking earlier dungeons much easier to tank
[3:09:44] <pectusumbra> alright, up too late as is due to shenanigans. good night
[3:09:45] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat How many Witcher 3's is that?
[3:09:47] <nsDrummer> LUL
[3:09:48] <%umbypokochan> OHHHHHHH!!!!
[3:09:49] <Ion_Laser> :D
[3:09:49] <%kewlmyc> NAILED IT
[3:09:50] <xmetalicdemonx> @spiritofmojave thanks
[3:09:51] <ColRedyx> @DesuDesuDokiDoki Press cancel so you have the window in the center selected and change which element is selected on the dropdown menu.

[3:09:55] <$jobbedbone> big clap for big dicks
[3:09:56] <%Darthwaffler> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[3:09:58] <AMaidIndeed> gottem
[3:10:01] <IndoorSitup> Pat you disappoint me
[3:10:02] <%MegboyManuel> @Kavtech The pools and fruit mechanic piss me off, not to mention how everyone else who runs it is an impatient fuck
[3:10:04] <%allouttajuice> @MisterCrimson are dps also getting aoe stuff earlier? If so that'd be nice, would allow for quicker clears
[3:10:07] <Monkeyweed21> Patrick is a big biatch
[3:10:07] <Zepik> i think it took me 300+ hours to catch up to current.
[3:10:09] <%ESP_ROOT> ESP_ROOT subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak! hello patty thanks for gettin me into 14! bought it like a couple days ago and im havin fun but i dunno if im feelin archer. at what point do you get to limsa lominsa? i would very much like to be a nair oo toe. im like lvl 14 if that helps
[3:10:09] <+Ell1ot> you did it, Pat. you won
[3:10:28] <@mothmandraws> though I think like 50% of the 16 hours is just walking back to waking sands
[3:10:33] <+Kavtech> @MegboyManuel Yeah, fair enough. I like the pools myself though.
[3:10:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @ColRedyx thank you
[3:10:37] <+MisterCrimson> @allouttajuice also, every tank is losing one of their combos since they are going to become redundant
[3:10:44] <%spiritofmojave> pRaY rEtUrN
[3:10:49] <$jobbedbone> radians aren't arbitrary pat, degrees are.
[3:10:52] <Jolnir> unsync
[3:10:54] <Bad1uck> @allouttajuice WAR has probably the best AoE. Steel cyclone isn't affected by the 20% dmg penalty with tank stance, it does a shit ton of damage in a huge area around you, and heals you for a huge amount based on damage done
[3:10:57] <nsDrummer> PRAY RETURN
[3:10:58] <$Valdorick> Pray, return
[3:10:59] <bestwaifuritsu> Pray return to the Waking Sands.
[3:11:06] <Monkeyweed21> that's why they level you down pat
[3:11:11] <$Desmond_Vakarian> go to limsa and take a boat
[3:11:11] <+oOZtkOo> i used the ferry at limsa
[3:11:12] <+MisterCrimson> @allouttajuice Most DPS have at least on of their AoEs by the time dungeons roll around so yes
[3:11:12] <%Verd_254> limsa then tele to conj
[3:11:13] <%MegboyManuel> Drink from the damn pools then you big punk ass weirdo >:I @Kavtech
[3:11:13] <Bad1uck> Yeah, set return to Limsa
[3:11:14] <+Zepshire> just use the ferry boat in limsa
[3:11:14] <42nfl19> Thats what they do in Guild Wars 2 @AngriestPat , when you go to lover level area they scale you down but you keep all abilites you unlock
[3:11:15] <@mothmandraws> limsa boat trip is faster, still like a 45 second run
[3:11:16] <Bad1uck> The ferry
[3:11:24] <%spiritofmojave> Limsa ferry saves a lot of pain
[3:11:29] <Edible_Enthusiasm> its by the Arcanists guild
[3:11:29] <%TheShal> Limsa > Arcanist Guild > Waking Sands
[3:11:30] <@commanderclaw> That's fucking dumb
[3:11:31] <%Faustgesicht> whoops
[3:11:31] <%allouttajuice> @MisterCrimson yeah I saw that tanks losing their comboes, it makes sense given the way tank stance functions now
[3:11:31] <Angry_Ev1L> not run tp to arcanist guild
[3:11:32] <%ESP_ROOT> hot tips
[3:11:32] <+Fynale> btw there is a lore reason why there isn't a teleport there
[3:11:34] <%AFoolishPaper> patches before HW are mind-numbingly boring
[3:11:34] <$danteskyrim2020> @AngriestPat no Squadron Bonus Ex?
[3:11:35] <+Azarian1> Shut
[3:11:36] <%TheShal> Alternatively, just get the map
[3:11:36] <rekinom> I didn't know you could do that NotLikeThis
[3:11:36] <+Azarian1> the fuck
[3:11:37] <Nina96> @AngriestPat its 80 gill
[3:11:38] <bestwaifuritsu> Or you can be a forgetful frank and accidentally go to Mor Dhona instead of Thanalan LUL
[3:11:39] <+Silentman0> bonus if you set limsa as your free teleport
[3:11:40] <+Azarian1> up
[3:11:42] <%Kirijuo> It’s only like 10 seconds faster
[3:11:44] <+khalcipher> that's really dumb
[3:11:45] <+Azarian1> I wish I knew that.
[3:11:45] <%Verd_254> meant arc but yeah, limsa then tele to arc
[3:11:46] <xeros720> there's a fairy?
[3:11:47] <%allouttajuice> @MisterCrimson and the aoe for dps is nice then, clear should be a lot better
[3:11:49] <%ESP_ROOT> NO
[3:11:50] <Monkeyweed21> Does Pat is the Big Straight?
[3:11:52] <%MegboyManuel> LOL
[3:11:56] <aqua_mashu> HUH
[3:11:57] <%umbypokochan> lore reason = excuse :P
[3:11:58] <+SlowLikeThunder> I love and hate that the fact there's no fucking aetheryte near the Waking Sands is a plotpoint
[3:11:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> he flip
[3:12:00] <%MegboyManuel> my friend has the upgraded one though
[3:12:02] <BourneWarrior> I wouldn't have to walk there if Minfilia wasnt such a lazy bum
[3:12:03] <Fuji_Apples> more like cronus-everybody has one
[3:12:04] <%allouttajuice> @MisterCrimson I played way back during 2.x content and never came back till now
[3:12:05] <%GarbageNirvana> I ain't got the patience to get cronus lux
[3:12:13] <%allouttajuice> Dungeons fucking blew @MisterCrimson
[3:12:15] <jackythefrost> Big dumb edgesword for big dumb pat
[3:12:16] <Kekon3> Any content you still haven't done btw?
[3:12:16] <x3as> @AngriestPat have you done any of the anima weapons quests?
[3:12:17] <%ESP_ROOT> hi :)
[3:12:18] <%MegboyManuel> Hey fuck off, Minfilia is great, ill fight you!
[3:12:20] <$jobbedbone> Pat is size queen for swords
[3:12:21] <bestwaifuritsu> real chads stop at Nothung
[3:12:21] <%FreyRune> Why are the anima relic weapons so good while eureka weapons look ugly af?
[3:12:23] <zamzoph> @how long does it take to level a class once you got level cap?
[3:12:23] <IndoorSitup> @angriestpat How do I cope with how badly SCH is about to be shafted and how boring it'll be to play? pls answer
[3:12:31] <+MisterCrimson> @allouttajuice oh yeah, there are major changes to gameplay every expansion
[3:12:32] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean I can't deny it
[3:12:33] <Monkeyweed21> But DRK sucks hot ass
[3:12:44] <LandOfTheWay> working on my bard's anima weapon right now as i grind out irregular tomestones
[3:12:45] <nsDrummer> anima weapons are good yeah, the grind isnt too bad these days
[3:12:48] <bestwaifuritsu> I remember Pats Guillotine
[3:12:49] <%umbypokochan> moogle weapons > all other weapons
[3:12:52] <nsDrummer> just, dont expect it to happen quickly
[3:12:54] <mastermidget23> @goofywizard No problem! I like talking about this stuff anyway. If you're just starting out in the game, your melee dps options are monk and dragoon, with rogue/ninja coming up sliiightly later. Dragoon (Lancer before it's upgraded) I don't know as much about, but it's a fairly simple class that is extremely solid, and has group utility. If you like spears and jumping around like a madman, it's great. Cool armor too. I love ninja due to it's extreme versatility. They've got a tool for every sit
[3:12:55] <+RhymesWithWasabi> @AngriestPat save me, im currently grinding out light on longstop hard for my anima light
[3:12:56] <%Finaldragoon> I started the Anima questline for the AST weapon. I wanted to wield a giant galaxy orb in my hand
[3:12:57] <jackythefrost> @Monkeyweed21 DRK is getting hard buffed in ShB
[3:12:57] <Kekon3> SCH 5.0 boring LUL
[3:12:57] <%MegboyManuel> yeah the Eureka weapons get REALLY ugly
[3:12:58] <+BioHunter> lol
[3:12:59] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat how long does it take to level a new class once you got level cap in somethingg?
[3:13:00] <%allouttajuice> @MisterCrimson still this feels A LOT bigger with TP removal. No more gimping of TP based rotations with aoe spam
[3:13:00] <CountMeowingtonn> i have DRK at level 40, i must push through to 60 ;-;
[3:13:01] <IndoorSitup> :c
[3:13:03] <+KalMyre> @FreyRune i actually really like the eureka weps, but the last stage for them i prefer the no glow versions since i really like the models LUL
[3:13:06] <@commanderclaw> Maybe you should heal instead?
[3:13:07] <%spiritofmojave> didn't they say they might dramatically change shit later?
[3:13:13] <%TheAverageSimon> I'm pretty glad that they have almost permanently moved the Scions base to the Rising Stones
[3:13:14] <IndoorSitup> F U G
[3:13:14] <Kekon3> New SCH looks fun dunno what y'all on about
[3:13:15] <+MisterCrimson> In FF14 "sucks ass" means a loss of 5% so suck it up
[3:13:16] <+HelloImTom08> just play another Job LUL
[3:13:17] <MC_GigglePants> I'm just gonna switch to a different class honestly
[3:13:19] <Monkeyweed21> No longer two heals
[3:13:20] <%Lapinelis> Pat, you have sprint on L3, what's a good thing to have on R3?
[3:13:22] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat do you think they will ever make a concept of a DODGE tank? i.e. It is not about being big tough and taking the hit but avoiding it all together.
[3:13:24] <%MegboyManuel> Scholars should be think about healing more tbh
[3:13:25] <BourneWarrior> @megboymanuel Minfilia sits in her own waste in her head office at the Solar. She needs to go OUTSIDE
[3:13:27] <%BlitzNeidhart> @AngriestPat Why don't you have the best DRK weapon, Deathbringer Ultima? Kappa
[3:13:28] <nsDrummer> Scholar is a DPS, the fairy is the healer
[3:13:30] <%Typhaeon> Wonder if they'll ever make PvP balanced or fun
[3:13:31] <CountMeowingtonn> Scholars were just a dps that had a part time job as a healer
[3:13:32] <Onamar> It's not even a nerf... Biolysis is as strong as both of their old DoTs combined. Losing Shadow Flare is what sucks. And no Energy Drain means we have no choice but to use Aetherflow on broken ass oGCD heals
[3:13:32] <nsDrummer> LUL
[3:13:33] <uberhox> @AngriestPat how hard is it to get into this game? i've never played an mmo in my life.
[3:13:34] <IndoorSitup> brb imma go into suicide watch
[3:13:37] <%MegboyManuel> @BourneWarrior progress that story!
[3:13:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeyeyye
[3:13:44] <bestwaifuritsu> F
[3:13:44] <%umbypokochan> mugu mugu
[3:13:47] <$Valdorick> Everyone saw - feel shame.
[3:13:47] <%weissguard> Dawwww
[3:13:47] <%Finaldragoon> stumb
[3:13:48] <Bad1uck> MUGU MUGU?!?!
[3:13:58] <zamzoph> more deeps
[3:13:59] <+Vruet> MNK was a dodge tank in 1.0 iirc
[3:14:00] <TerryTheTurret> @Lapinelis Lock-on is usually good imo
[3:14:00] <Kerozero> I await the day of Chocobo knights
[3:14:00] <Psyramics> Dodge tanks are a bitch to balance cause their damage intake is so spikey
[3:14:01] <%Mekhet09> @AngriestPat So I have to ask did you care about ala mhigo? Did anyone care about it?
[3:14:03] <Fuzz_331> can we get uhhhhhh new healer
[3:14:03] <+Silentman0> @Kekon3 love how they took away most of our best fairy gauge builders
[3:14:04] <jackythefrost> whens Timemage
[3:14:08] <$OmegaWeltall> ok as a healer, when everyones at 90%-100% health what am i supposed to do? put my thumb up my ass or throw out a few DEEPs?
[3:14:08] <CountMeowingtonn> chocobo knight tank class when
[3:14:09] <+Shockrates20XX> An actual hybrid would be cool, but they probably would have done that with Red Mage, the traditional hybrid.
[3:14:09] <ExpressNode> I think Etrian Odyssey V had something of a dodge tank. I loved that
[3:14:10] <%ESP_ROOT> hope they add geomancer. i want a big ass bell
[3:14:13] <%FreyRune> @KalMyre they just feel incomplete and it should have one more stage to completion
[3:14:13] <+RushUnplugged> people hoped for Dancer to be a dodgetank, so with that option gone, it's never gonna happen
[3:14:17] <%Wonderbot3000> Whens calculator
[3:14:17] <%umbypokochan> ala mihgo suuuuuuuucks assssss
[3:14:18] <$Valdorick> When's Calculator as a class!?
[3:14:19] <CountMeowingtonn> @jackythefrost astro is as close as you'll get
[3:14:23] <BourneWarrior> @megboymanuel I cant because I have to haul ass back to her super secret HQ every 15 minutes
[3:14:24] <@mothmandraws> ive just got to it
[3:14:25] <+StrawberryPantsu> Yotsuyu bes girl Aymric bes boi
[3:14:28] <@mothmandraws> they are all assholes
[3:14:28] <%Divryne> Fuck Ala Mhigo.
[3:14:30] <%TheAverageSimon> Oh yeah, same
[3:14:31] <+Silentman0> @OmegaWeltall do the deeps. if anyone tells you to overheal, they're bad at the game
[3:14:31] <%allouttajuice> @AngriestPat you think they'll add a new healer next expac or nah?
[3:14:32] <x3as> LUL
[3:14:33] <GypsySquid> That's fair.
[3:14:33] <%MegboyManuel> Ala Mhigo was *FINE* after Doma for me
[3:14:34] <@mothmandraws> I tried to be nice to them
[3:14:34] <%spiritofmojave> I cared about Doma way more
[3:14:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> it has sand
[3:14:36] <%yeknomlive> at least we got to doma
[3:14:37] <Monkeyweed21> hey the peaks are kinda cool
[3:14:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> and more sand
[3:14:38] <ittla> doma is super coooool
[3:14:38] <MajinRaviel> PATRICIO!! <3
[3:14:38] <zepelinnn> i cared when Raubahn showed up
[3:14:40] <Mastigias> Ala Mhigo got shafted
[3:14:40] <%Divryne> The Ala Mhigans had it coming. LUL
[3:14:41] <%GarbageNirvana> There was no Azys Lla, that's for damn sure
[3:14:42] <+KoyaMusa> i'm just gonna be dissapointed when beast master will inevitably be a limited job
[3:14:43] <+MisterCrimson> Hey. That under water salt city is pretty neat
[3:14:44] <%AFoolishPaper> little ala mhigo is more interesting rofl
[3:14:45] <+RhymesWithWasabi> I prefer it over doma tbh
[3:14:45] <%Lapinelis> @TerryTheTurret lock on seems pointless since it's just there always
[3:14:45] <ashuckel> i don't see a dodge tank on this game ever, as in, relying on rng to mitigate stuff, unless they make dodge to be basically like a block
[3:14:46] <GypsySquid> Also, the Ala Mhigans are assholes.
[3:14:47] <+KalMyre> @FreyRune what disappointed me the most was the ending glow. f.ex. the summonr weapon had really cool moving wings on the book, but the last glow is just floating balls
[3:14:52] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> They started a war with Gridania over how much of a shithole Gyr Abania is.
[3:14:52] <%MegboyManuel> Ala Mihgo quests were shit till after Doma
[3:14:52] <%blastazoid26> LUL
[3:14:55] <@mothmandraws> its the little one
[3:14:56] <%ArcanumMBD> I didn't know about Doma/Kugane, and thought Ala Miga was gonna be weeb town, and was horribly disappointed to find the truth
[3:14:56] <Angry_Ev1L> stop being racist to ala mhigo LUL
[3:15:00] <@mothmandraws> I tried to give them medicine
[3:15:01] <%Divryne> It's like China town.
[3:15:03] <Kekon3> @Silentman0 don't need them if our SCH Fairy is just better and our force crit is good
[3:15:04] <@commanderclaw> Refugee camp/ghetto
[3:15:04] <@mothmandraws> they said fuck off
[3:15:05] <%Divryne> But shittier.
[3:15:05] <%TheShal> It's a ghetto that the Ul'Dah superiors shoved them into.
[3:15:06] <ColRedyx> @uberhox They do a lot of active tutorializing. Just read the tutorials and your ability tooltips and you'll be fine. If you're playing on controller, look up how to turn on extended hold controls.
[3:15:08] <Bad1uck> Yep, they got fucked over and abandoned by EVERYONE
[3:15:09] <+Shockrates20XX> I guess the only "traditional" FF class left is Time Mage. Don't know how that would work though.
[3:15:10] <Kerozero> Im allowed to be racist to ingame races right?
[3:15:12] <$jobbedbone> ????
[3:15:13] <count_bob> >.>
[3:15:13] <goofywizard> @mastermidget23 Thanks bro, you have been helpful and knowledgeable in the FFXIV stuff. I will now try the trial and see how it goes but i am 95% sure im gonna buy the game lol! Thanks again!
[3:15:13] <RoboXGP> whooops
[3:15:14] <xeros720> and poland was forced to live in caves
[3:15:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ????
[3:15:15] <+StrawberryPantsu> FOR ALA MHIGO
[3:15:15] <@mothmandraws> also fuck ye egg dude is back in limsa
[3:15:16] <Monkeyweed21> Ala Mhigo is LITERALLY AFGHANISTAN
[3:15:17] <alrobot2014> oh that sounds like that fucking sucks
[3:15:17] <%blastazoid26> Its a sneak peak of the real ala mhigo
[3:15:17] <count_bob> But we didn't though.
[3:15:19] <IndoorSitup> "We?"
[3:15:21] <Kekon3> Force Crit Shield and spread? fuck yeah
[3:15:25] <%spiritofmojave> We didn't really in time lol
[3:15:27] <%HiroTSK5> Walk up to Old guy, tells me to Fuck off, Quest Complete here's a bunch of Experience.
[3:15:27] <TerryTheTurret> @Lapinelis Yes but this allows you to unlock at will which is good when you need to disengage quickly without breaking the target on the enemy
[3:15:32] <%FreyRune> feels bad that monk was supposed to be the poster boy for stormblood but got completely shafted lol
[3:15:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> REALLY
[3:15:35] <ittla> @AngriestPat do you have to complete things on the duty finder before they're added to your roulette
[3:15:35] <Tucker0603> YES
[3:15:35] <+Silentman0> @Kekon3 so just throw out the thing that 60-70 was built on? okay
[3:15:36] <jackythefrost> @mothmandraws Real Ala Mhigo is only gotten to in Stormblood
[3:15:38] <%Divryne> It sure does.
[3:15:39] <$KwakuAnansi> yes
[3:15:39] <bestwaifuritsu> M'naago is the cutest.
[3:15:40] <GypsySquid> Really, really.
[3:15:42] <Tucker0603> IT DOES
[3:15:42] <%blastazoid26> "MAY"
[3:15:43] <%Divryne> BOY DOES IT.
[3:15:45] <$Valdorick> "IF ONLY WE HAD THIS MEDICINE!" - that asshole, most likely.
[3:15:46] <%TheAverageSimon> @AngriestPat Do you think they could even add another healer class?
[3:15:46] <+HelloImTom08> but if you dont remember who cares LUL
[3:15:47] <%spiritofmojave> might Kappa
[3:15:47] <%MegboyManuel> Yeah the dude wanna make love to you after
[3:15:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> woooow
[3:15:53] <Onamar> For alha mhiiiiiiiiiiiiigoooooo
[3:15:53] <Bad1uck> Pat is right, hoyl shit I forgot about that
[3:15:56] <@mothmandraws> ive got a laundry list of "remember this dude"
[3:15:56] <%Lapinelis> Gonna try it, Terry
[3:15:59] <$TsundereFFXIV> aka 4 YEARS later if you did it at release
[3:16:02] <%AFoolishPaper> S L O P P E H
[3:16:03] <Monkeyweed21> Ul'Dah is Egypt, Ala Mhigo is Afghanistan
[3:16:04] <%ESP_ROOT> D:
[3:16:06] <ExpressNode> Only the deepest of pulls
[3:16:06] <$Valdorick> This boss is dope
[3:16:07] <+StrawberryPantsu> Sloppahy
[3:16:08] <+Dessbocito2> i want a medic ;-;
[3:16:10] <NoirePanzer> GEO is just AST in XIV
[3:16:10] <%MegboyManuel> FF14 is really good at the deep pulls dude
[3:16:10] <GypsySquid> Chemist would be fucking rad.
[3:16:12] <%templar010> TIME MAGE
[3:16:12] <xeros720> fuck yeah, chemist
[3:16:13] <+RushUnplugged> CHEMIST WOULD ROCK
[3:16:13] <MC_GigglePants> I would play the shit out of Geomancer
[3:16:14] <alrobot2014> chemist is rad
[3:16:15] <$Valdorick> Chemist with guns.
[3:16:15] <@commanderclaw> Alchemy is cooler than magic
[3:16:16] <+Dessbocito2> yea a fking chemist a pot thrower
[3:16:16] <haisho> dont forget GUN

[3:16:20] <%ecolli37108> i mean, they showed that geomancer is just ast
[3:16:21] <Edible_Enthusiasm> DRINK THIS
[3:16:22] <mastermidget23> @goofywizard Good luck man! Have fun! Don't be afraid to try out the other classes if the one's you try don't "Click" yet. And uh, be warned that aaaall the classes get more fun to play as you level. Your initial rotation is a LOT of super simple rotations of moves.
[3:16:22] <CountMeowingtonn> time mage = astrologian
[3:16:23] <%marsano168> throw bottles at people

[3:16:24] <%Mekhet09> That would be nice. Just not as a limited class. I hated what a waste blue mage was.

[3:16:27] <zepelinnn> GEO is not AST, they have differences
[3:16:27] <%allouttajuice> @AngriestPat we already have (al)chemist
[3:16:27] <%templar010> Or Esper
[3:16:28] <%arcaderabbit48> I would be fine with Geomancer, but Chemist is the one I truly want
[3:16:28] <Monkeyweed21> BIg drug cooldown
[3:16:30] <TioXyco> Geomancer would be DPS of sorts. Chemist with Throw Potion would be cool
[3:16:31] <A_Red_Robot> @Kerozero Alchemist is already a crafting class in the game
[3:16:32] <%Finaldragoon> #MakeBlueMageARealJob
[3:16:34] <+KoyaMusa> i just want beast master to not be a limited job, even though it will be

[3:16:39] <IndoorSitup> Time Mage W H E N??
[3:16:41] <+Dessbocito2> throwing ebola for DoT
[3:16:41] <Kerozero> Thats what I mean lmao
[3:16:43] <Kekon3> @Silentman0 I mean, I don't know what to tell you, you're unhappy that its getting toned down when it was literally the 7th power in our kit in the first place
[3:16:44] <jackythefrost> Remember in Bravely Defualt where the chemist class was just throwing glass bottles of potions at their allies
[3:16:45] <%Verd_254> make chemist named heisenberg
[3:16:46] <%chad_irl> Am a chemist irl, can confirm
[3:16:47] <Bad1uck> @AngriestPat I loved Engineer in GW2, so I want chemist so hard after your description
[3:16:52] <@mothmandraws> GIVE ME CHOCOBO KNIGHT
[3:16:55] <%Fadedblank247> Time Mage would be cool
[3:16:55] <%FreyRune> I want scientist doctor to be a healer, similar to granblue frantasy
[3:16:55] <%TheShal> Oh man. Look at best mage back there. DOING IT
[3:16:57] <@mothmandraws> LET ME FIGHT ON MY CHOCOBO IN DUNGEONS
[3:16:58] <%Octakon910> Octakon910 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:17:02] <Monkeyweed21> what about onion knight
[3:17:04] <%arcaderabbit48> We could have a Mix mechanic for like buffs and stuff
[3:17:06] <%MegboyManuel> I want a BLITZBALL PLAYER class
[3:17:07] <CountMeowingtonn> Time mage = ASTRO ya DUMBOS
[3:17:09] <supuhmagikarp> There is an alchemist class tough usedBalding
[3:17:09] <+Silentman0> @Kekon3 i guess i'm just crazy for wanting to press a lot of buttons when i play the game
[3:17:10] <%arcaderabbit48> Like Mudra but more scientific
[3:17:13] <+StrawberryPantsu> Chocobo Knight Would be cool
[3:17:15] <haveswordmuststing> but then it would be a ranged DPS Kappa
[3:17:16] <IndoorSitup> no but seriously Time Mage is the best job class in FF dont @ me
[3:17:17] <goofywizard> @mastermidget23 Cheers its gonna be great
[3:17:20] <TerryTheTurret> @Lapinelis Oh and it's also good when you're against a wall or somewhere where you can't see veryw well unlocking allows you to move the camera.
[3:17:20] <ExpressNode> Basically just throw all jobs from Bravely Default into this game
[3:17:20] <+Silentman0> but i guess pressing 3 buttons is good too
[3:17:21] <%MegboyManuel> I just wanna be a racist soccer player in this game
[3:17:23] <haveswordmuststing> @indoorsitup @
[3:17:24] <%arcaderabbit48> @supuhmagikarp Nobody cares about Crafters though
[3:17:26] <Thalchampz> goddamn Kushala
[3:17:29] <+Double_Tap_That> !uptime
[3:17:30] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 17m.
[3:17:37] <xeros720> when i did this, none of the other fuckers would use the cannons, and I, the healer, had to
[3:17:40] <%allouttajuice> @MegboyManuel you just reminded of Mat and woolie's ff10 lp thanks dude
[3:17:41] <%Darthwaffler> @mothmandraws What do you think of Mothra's new design in Godzilla: King of the Monsters?
[3:17:45] <%MegboyManuel> Can I just be, a Viera Wakka.
[3:17:45] <+HunterOfGentlemen> I haven't seen much ffIV and I tend to play MMOs solo, still recommend?
[3:17:49] <+StrawberryPantsu> >Blitzer Ranged DPS
[3:17:51] <%Lapinelis> @TerryTheTurret Gonna do a trial run
[3:17:52] <+StrawberryPantsu> sure
[3:18:01] <@mothmandraws> its a good mothra design
[3:18:02] <Angry_Ev1L> @xeros720 and they were right to do so Kappa
[3:18:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> take it u bitch
[3:18:04] <%MegboyManuel> @allouttajuice bruddah =u=
[3:18:15] <haveswordmuststing> @hunterofgentlemen you will HAVE to deal with people to progress the story
[3:18:15] <Monkeyweed21> Gobble the money like the filthy whore you are
[3:18:16] <$KwakuAnansi> @AngriestPat I know this isn't related to FF14, but FF10. What is Wakka's Job?
[3:18:21] <%ESP_ROOT> E S P
[3:18:22] <Kekon3> @Silentman0 Thats not gone, but you need to get better at slide casting because fey union will hit 100 at longer times but if you weren't using it before 30 then your tank never needed it
[3:18:25] <+MisterCrimson> Granbd Wizard
[3:18:28] <ColRedyx> @xeros720 The healer is the best person to do it. You have the lowest DPS.
[3:18:33] <%MegboyManuel> Grand Wizard
[3:18:33] <%allouttajuice> @KwakuAnansi ranger/ something else iirc
[3:18:34] <xmetalicdemonx> Before entering a brand new dungeon is it normal to do research on that dungeon or is it fine to go in blind?
[3:18:37] <Zepik> I just want strident to throw one stone. just one XD
[3:18:38] <TioXyco> pat became an influencer
[3:18:38] <%Wonderbot3000> Whens ffxiv getting blitz ball
[3:18:42] <+KalMyre> @KwakuAnansi blitzball player Kappa
[3:18:47] <+StrawberryPantsu> Never
[3:18:55] <%Darthwaffler> sbfpBleetz
[3:18:59] <+Silentman0> @Kekon3 we'll be stronger. we'll also have less abilities. i like to have a lot of abilities because that's more fun
[3:19:01] <Kekon3> @Wonderbot3000 dude, I legit would not be surprized
[3:19:03] <Thalchampz> 15 i believe
[3:19:07] <Monkeyweed21> Square Enix will give you a Lalafell
[3:19:08] <+clansnevets> Dude, it's so neat to see you streaming
[3:19:09] <%ESP_ROOT> PogChamp thanks
[3:19:10] <+Ell1ot> i think the 30 free days from twitch gave me the base game. i went to the sub management page and it says i have the base game
[3:19:11] <zepelinnn> you wont "feel the class" at 14
[3:19:14] <+clansnevets> I've never watched before
[3:19:16] <EVA_Unit02> Become as Nalt
[3:19:18] <%MegboyManuel> Give me Death, or Give me Blitzball class
[3:19:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> narudo
[3:19:22] <TioXyco> archer is not weird D:
[3:19:27] <Nina96> @AngriestPat how do i get darknight?
[3:19:30] <bestwaifuritsu> low level Rogue quests are such a pain because you have to constantly read the butchered piratespeak in your head
[3:19:31] <%umbypokochan> @AngriestPat does Woolie know you can easily make a character that looks like Enzo from Reboot AND do the Haka in FFXIV? and also punch girls?
[3:19:31] <+aslfrasle> Nier-uto
[3:19:35] <+KalMyre> most jobs in 14 you wont get a proper feel for until lvl 60
[3:19:37] <%GarbageNirvana> It's weird how they still lock those classes behind quests
[3:19:37] <+StrawberryPantsu> ARC sux
[3:19:37] <haveswordmuststing> theres probably a tactics job im forgetting that'd be dope for this game
[3:19:39] <Bad1uck> @Ell1ot If you buy Shadowbringers you get the previous expansions too
[3:19:39] <+RushUnplugged> @xmetalicdemonx depends if you're the tank or not. Tanks usually benefit from knowing mechanics more. In general, just mention it at the start and people are usually chill
[3:19:41] <@mothmandraws> im at lvl 40 and im just getting hang of dragoon
[3:19:44] <%FreyRune> arcanist is the weirdest starting job, is it a healer or a dps??? we just don't know
[3:19:47] <+StrawberryPantsu> BRD Sux
[3:19:51] <@mothmandraws> do combo and jump occasionally
[3:19:53] <+TheImmortal70> The core of the class is only complete at like 50 if you're lucky
[3:19:53] <mastermidget23> @xmetalicdemonx It's usually okay just going in and stating you're new, most people are cool with the warning. Try to do what the other dps is doing if you're dps. There WILL be a few dungeons with surprises, I'd just say learn from mistakes. Maybe ask at the start of a dungeon if there's anything you should know.
[3:19:54] <@commanderclaw> I'm level 44 and I still feel like I'm half a class
[3:19:56] <+Silentman0> @Nina96 get to the first expansion, the guy that gives you the class is in the city you unlock
[3:19:59] <%allouttajuice> The problem with ff14 legit feels like, at least in 2.x, is Jobs don't TURN ON until level 50+
[3:20:01] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat how long does it take to level a new class once you got level cap in somethingg?
[3:20:01] <ColRedyx> Even with Ninja, it's just going to be the same as every other melee DPS until you get to about 30.
[3:20:07] <Kekon3> @Silentman0 no shit, even though they technically combined the damage of SF and Mia2, I wouldn't be surprised if we get Mia2 again for the second patch in a row
[3:20:08] <%MegboyManuel> your class only really blooms at 60-70 imo
[3:20:10] <%allouttajuice> Some jobs don't get crucial rotation skills until post 50
[3:20:11] <%Nobrev> @Ell1ot the twitch prime thing was for getting the starter edition free. not just the free trial
[3:20:17] <%GarbageNirvana> You'd be better off leveling a tank so you can really get a feel for how tanking works
[3:20:20] <%allouttajuice> Like MCH currently seems to suck
[3:20:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Since that's what DRK is
[3:20:20] <Sydin18> Once u get palace of the dead, u can practice a class there
[3:20:23] <+StrawberryPantsu> @commanderclaw you're like 1/3 of a class
[3:20:31] <CountMeowingtonn> Paladin isnt complete until level 60 imo
[3:20:32] <%allouttajuice> Cause they can't manage their heat mechanic (they get in the 50's) until 62
[3:20:33] <AquaRoads> Exciting gameplay here folks
[3:20:34] <@Velyndra> If you want to get a "feel" for a job, once you hit 17 you can unlock the Deep Dungeon, Palace of the Dead. When you go in, you'll "level up" inside at a faster rate
[3:20:35] <%allouttajuice> wtf is that?
[3:20:35] <%DXLelouch24> i went PLD-DRK
[3:20:37] <+Ell1ot> neat! so i need a sub and the expansion
[3:20:38] <%ESP_ROOT> @GarbageNirvana i have no intention of tanking cus im a dumbass
[3:20:39] <%DXLelouch24> felt natural
[3:20:40] <sumire_gelato> imo you won't starte feeling archer til 30
[3:20:48] <%AFoolishPaper> 60
[3:20:48] <xmetalicdemonx> @RushUnplugged I am a tank, I do state im new but I started doing research because I felt bad and enough people complained.
[3:20:49] <%TheShal> 60
[3:20:53] <+alphonseisbest> @angriestpat hey do u have to reach storm blood to get RDM & SAM?
[3:20:54] <%Octakon910> no problem Pat
[3:20:56] <%kknutson4> Does FF14 have subclasses like FF11?
[3:20:57] <%GarbageNirvana> Tanking isn't actually that hard, it's just a matter of positioning and holding enmity
[3:20:57] <Bad1uck> @zamzoph Once you have a class at max level you get what's called an Armory Bonus, which gives you a 30-50% EXP boost
[3:20:59] <Monkeyweed21> Need to get Job crystal first
[3:21:00] <+StrawberryPantsu> WAR>drk>>pld
[3:21:00] <haveswordmuststing> @esp_root play Warrior, its basically a DPS Kappa
[3:21:03] <+KalMyre> independent leveling in PotD and you level very quick
[3:21:04] <ColRedyx> @Ell1ot If you signed up from the Twitch promotion then you already have the base game, you only need to buy Shadowbringers.
[3:21:04] <%Taisuru> Need job crystal
[3:21:08] <CountMeowingtonn> I'm getting log in queues every single day lmao
[3:21:10] <@Velyndra> Keep in mind at 14 though, you'd go into POTD as archer, not bard
[3:21:12] <@mothmandraws> red mage starter is in uldah atm
[3:21:13] <+StrawberryPantsu> PLD is ResidentSleeper
[3:21:16] <Kekon3> nah, for SAM/RDM you just have to hit 50, you can just get that at the end of ARR
[3:21:17] <%GarbageNirvana> As long as you're doing your rotation you've got most of it
[3:21:17] <TioXyco> you ahve to HAVE SB tho
[3:21:20] <$KwakuAnansi> TY for the answers on wakka, he's always stumped on what job role he was
[3:21:27] <Monkeyweed21> RDM is rad
[3:21:28] <zepelinnn> PLD got amazing over time
[3:21:28] <+StrawberryPantsu> 60
[3:21:31] <%DXLelouch24> oh cool
[3:21:32] <TheEvilOmega> Note: You have to have those expansions.
[3:21:33] <+Evitron1> PotD is how i levelled all my classes to 30 actually
[3:21:35] <%Laecerelius> Yeah I was super surprised that they were in Ul'Dah
[3:21:39] <zepelinnn> PLD i looking RAD in ShB
[3:21:40] <%Voidwyvern> lvl 50 + finish 2.0 for RDM adn SAM
[3:21:43] <AquaRoads> @AngriestPat How do you feel about the changes done to DRK?
[3:21:43] <%TheShal> Lominsa and Gridania
[3:21:46] <CountMeowingtonn> @AngriestPat Did you see that the other day Aether was so full you could only create a character in one server?
[3:21:51] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat gunbreaker is in gridania and dancer is limsa lominsa
[3:21:53] <%allouttajuice> Lominsa for Dancer, Gridania for Breaker @AngriestPat
[3:21:54] <%Darthwaffler> @AngriestPat How much is the monthly sub for this?
[3:21:54] <%Guardiansaiyan> !uptime
[3:21:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 21m.
[3:21:57] <bestwaifuritsu> Go get those level 60 tome sets so you can be the biggest GNB
[3:21:58] <%ESP_ROOT> if i buy ShB i dont have to buy SB right?
[3:21:58] <badhaye> lominsa dancer and gridania gunbreaker
[3:22:00] <%FreyRune> if you guys really want to level up fast, preorder shadowbringers and you obtain the aetheryte earrings which grant you 30% exp until level 70
[3:22:04] <%Solidnick18> Solidnick18 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[3:22:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> smacc his butttt
[3:22:05] <mastermidget23> Anyone know if they're bumping jump potions to 70, or planning to? I might scum it out on an alt class.
[3:22:14] <+RushUnplugged> @xmetalicdemonx I mostly watched MTQcapture videos on dungeons and raids before each and that's most the info you need. Sorry you ran into some assholes
[3:22:22] <Angry_Ev1L> of course it is
[3:22:27] <+KalMyre> @ESP_ROOT yes, but im not sure how it works if you buy shadowbringers when it hasnt released yet. but you basically only need to get the latest expansion and base game
[3:22:27] <%korth367> hey im in aether
[3:22:28] <Monkeyweed21> Come on down to Jenova, we punt kick all our lalafells here
[3:22:31] <@commanderclaw> Come on over to Primal boys and girls
[3:22:32] <ColRedyx> It would be even MORE true now after the DC split. All the casual RP servers went to Crystal.
[3:22:33] <+Deosier> I can confirm on the assholes
[3:22:34] <Kekon3> Nah, they split it specifically to sanction off the raiders to Aether
[3:22:34] <haisho> It's raiding. Of course it's full of assholes.
[3:22:35] <TheEvilOmega> I've not run into a single asshole on Siren.
[3:22:36] <AquaRoads> atleast it isn't Balmung
[3:22:39] <+KoyaMusa> just learn japanese and raid on chocobo if you want clears :^)
[3:22:42] <%allouttajuice> Primal or Crystal

[3:22:45] <+MisterCrimson> Behemoth is fun
[3:22:46] <%yeknomlive> primal is for the chilled crowd
[3:22:46] <@mothmandraws> come to ultros on primal, the elmig free company accepts all
[3:22:46] <%Mekhet09> At least it's not crystal

[3:23:13] <ColRedyx> And by the way, I've played on Aether AND Primal, and Aether is only the "pro raiding data center" if you can get into a hardcore static. The general skill in duty finder is A GODDAMN DUMPSTER FIRE compared to the average Primal group.
[3:23:15] <+StrawberryPantsu> Kektaur is great
[3:23:15] <%galaxyswirl> hi im a resident crystal, its so lonely
[3:23:17] <haisho> Lucky me. I did an RNG and landed on Ultros
[3:23:17] <@commanderclaw> I don't get RPing in an MMO, this isn't a D&D game with your friends
[3:23:18] <Eternal_Harmony> oh no
[3:23:18] <Zepik> crystal is fine, plus we have erp'ers to gawk at and be weirded out by
[3:23:18] <cylish> wait FFXIV has a goldshire equivalent?

[3:23:40] <+phamchri> leave the rps alone, they arent hurting anyone
[3:23:42] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah, I got places for that and FFXIV ain't it
[3:23:43] <+KoyaMusa> wow, great community btw
[3:23:45] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean uh
[3:23:46] <$KwakuAnansi> Ah like Moonguard then
[3:23:47] <%Darthwaffler> Those two catgirl lesbians
[3:23:48] <Mastigias> I'm stuck malboro and refuse to leave and lose my house
[3:23:49] <Bad1uck> @cylish Yes, go check out the Inn in Ul`Dah
[3:23:51] <+clansnevets> I feel called out
[3:23:54] <%allouttajuice> @Zepik from what I heard, avoid limsa at all costs
[3:23:54] <%Solidnick18> I love you pat
[3:23:54] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Yeah, the only jerks I've encountered on Aether tend to be in the raids
[3:23:55] <+HelloImTom08> Crystal bets a bad rap, most dont even RP its just a bad meme
[3:23:55] <haveswordmuststing> @xeros720 tell him the mogcenter moves characters between worlds
[3:23:56] <+StrawberryPantsu> Cock an ball tourer
[3:23:57] <Angry_Ev1L> Why the fuck would you not want parses for everything if you're doing savage raids?
[3:24:00] <Kekon3> I, on crystal, learned how to raid better than half of the jerks on Aether LUL
[3:24:05] <%AFoolishPaper> the balmung brothels lmao
[3:24:06] <%Solidnick18> yeah man this looks cool
[3:24:10] <cylish> Thats disturbing lol
[3:24:16] <ColRedyx> @Angry_Ev1L Because snowflakes melt in the heat of battle.
[3:24:16] <Angry_Ev1L> People are so fucking bad at this game that you MUST KICK THEM if they don't have enough dps
[3:24:18] <SweetCuppingCake> I use to be on Diabolos and hardly ever saw any fucky things.
[3:24:18] <%Solidnick18> with the dragons and stuff
[3:24:19] <+RushUnplugged> Fun fact: I change my character a lot, the only time I got horrible, HORRIBLE sexual harassment was when I was playing a male catboy
[3:24:20] <jackythefrost> Crystal is the best
[3:24:20] <Monkeyweed21> All the assholes are on Gilgamesh and Cactaur
[3:24:32] <%Ixiah> will pat and woolie stream e3 together ? and what about Paige ?
[3:24:33] <Kekon3> IT IS ALL on Gilgamesh!
[3:24:34] <Zepik> Limsa seems fine it's just super crowded on every server. I do a lot of shopping on Balmung now
[3:24:35] <@mothmandraws> I need to check your DPS while we run Totorak
[3:24:39] <+Kavtech> I'm on crystal right now and a recruiting party's description reads thusly: "if> cute vers boi uwu"
[3:24:39] <$SleepyMaribo> @Solidnick18 this aint nothing, wait till you see later heavsenward and storm blood content.
[3:24:41] <TheEvilOmega> What the heck is a parse?
[3:24:44] <+AlphaAgito> So basically meter whores
[3:24:50] <$Valdorick> Ah, MMO problem
[3:24:51] <+TendrilsTwitch> its equal to fighting game tier lists
[3:24:53] <Psyramics> its really hard to track those other things
[3:24:53] <+Dessbocito2> very few people are like that LUL
[3:24:53] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat don't worry pat the top raiders make fun of the parsers cuz they're dumb as hell
[3:24:54] <%Octakon910> Does payment auto renew or do i manually renew every month?
[3:24:59] <+Ell1ot> it was like that in WoW
[3:25:00] <@commanderclaw> Or how about the fact that you're doing your job right rather than going for big DPS?
[3:25:01] <haveswordmuststing> @rushunplugged figures, want to change that character to hrothgar to see how that works Kappa
[3:25:02] <+zyberion626> E Peen
[3:25:02] <%Solidnick18> @SleepyMaribo oh cool
[3:25:03] <Fuji_Apples> BUT MUH PARSE
[3:25:04] <+Silentman0> @Octakon910 you can pick one or the other
[3:25:05] <+RaziWraith> That's probably why parcers are prohibited. LUL
[3:25:06] <+Kavtech> There's an advertisement for a maid cafe on crystal right now also...
[3:25:08] <%allouttajuice> Parses only matter for the top 5%, most people use it as an excuse for being bad
[3:25:09] <+oOZtkOo> its just dps meters
[3:25:09] <%Nobrev> @TheEvilOmega using a 3rd party program to look at dps numbers
[3:25:10] <Angry_Ev1L> In my experience this 2 are connected. If guy can't do decent DPS he'll probably be fucking garbage at mechanics too
[3:25:13] <%BlitzNeidhart> How come Aether has the most assholes while still being the worst raiding scene in the whole game? @AngriestPat
[3:25:13] <Kekon3> All Classes in this game can currently Clear all content in this game for reference.
[3:25:13] <transporterthesequel> You do more damage when you're ALIVE
[3:25:14] <%Solidnick18> hmmm
[3:25:18] <ColRedyx> @TheEvilOmega Comes from parser, which is a type of program that reads combat log data and parses it for useful info.
[3:25:22] <%Solidnick18> apatHoldon
[3:25:24] <+KoyaMusa> on jp servers its different. safe practicing of mechanics is prefered over optimized dps and failed mechs
[3:25:24] <xeros720> don't all mmos have that parser culture?
[3:25:26] <transporterthesequel> Also aggro meter's are totally fine for parsing.
[3:25:27] <indig0bird> BLM weapon
[3:25:27] <%TheShal> BEST MAGE STAFF
[3:25:28] <Bad1uck> awwww
[3:25:29] <%allouttajuice> Unless you're competing for world firsts, parses legit don't matter lol @AngriestPat
[3:25:29] <%Typhaeon> Wow it's a Beetleborg
[3:25:29] <%MasterDecoder> Elitists suck
[3:25:30] <%MyDarkStorm> They use a software called ACT for that Shit\
[3:25:33] <%Faustgesicht> so what about healers?
[3:25:35] <haisho> but you hate BLM
[3:25:36] <transporterthesequel> RIP AGGRO FROM THE TANK, you do good job!
[3:25:36] <garbageheaphound> TIME TO LEVEL BLACK MAGE
[3:25:36] <%elxinon> elxinon subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:25:37] <%umbypokochan> eh... it's not a moogle
[3:25:38] <+Fynale> it's no stardust rod but hey
[3:25:38] <%0dd0ne0ut> Cmon @AngriestPat the rest of crystal is fine its just balmung is like chernobyl if it wasnt a cool but sad tragedy and instead was filled with weird freakazoids basically we need to quarantine balmung
[3:25:39] <+Silentman0> but pat you hate black mage???
[3:25:40] <SweetCuppingCake> Pat likes something BLM?
[3:25:40] <+binkarus> it looks like something out of prisma illya
[3:25:41] <%Solidnick18> neat
[3:25:41] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat theres a site that records all parse results and ranks players based off it, its what parse players use for raid selection.
[3:25:43] <+HelloImTom08> thats so ugly LUL its a bug on a stick
[3:25:45] <+AlphaAgito> Also most of the time people look at meters completely wrong like looking at DPS vs damage done or looking at a healer's HPS as if it means something
[3:25:46] <Angry_Ev1L> @transporterthesequel agro meters? no they're not lol
[3:25:49] <indig0bird> That dungeon also drops a cool Dragoon lance
[3:25:50] <ColRedyx> Real talk though, parsing is definitely helpful, but you have to look at the whole picture.
[3:25:51] <MC_GigglePants> Time to level Megumin class
[3:25:51] <%Verd_254> is there even a legit way to see dps of party? I'd like to just to know how my dps is compared to others.
[3:25:53] <haisho> why would you like something for Black Mages? That's heresy!
[3:25:57] <%Faustgesicht> So do they parse healing?
[3:25:58] <%WheatlyXT> ACT is not allowed but a lot of people use it anyway.
[3:26:01] <%TheShal> Yes
[3:26:01] <+aslfrasle> Kaladanda is a dope BLM Staff
[3:26:02] <Swish19XX> Last time I was raiding in WoW in BfA people were always talking about parses. Super lame. Then I looked and I saw I was a good holy priest so I get where people can get up their own asses with it
[3:26:09] <haisho> @Faustgesicht They parse everything. EVERYTHING.
[3:26:10] <%FreyRune> it's against the rules for players to use damage parse so if they get toxic about your numbers, you can easily report them
[3:26:12] <+MisterCrimson> min-maxxing in this game results in about 2-5% increases of damage output compared to just having max ilevel gear
[3:26:12] <+KalMyre> @umbypokochan you can actually have ST, ET and LT LUL
[3:26:13] <%alexe76> what server do you play on again pat?
[3:26:15] <%Faustgesicht> fun
[3:26:15] <ColRedyx> No matter how good you think you are, if you're pulling under 2k you're basically dead weight.
[3:26:16] <%WheatlyXT> I call people out when they're being shits about it to other people to put them down.
[3:26:20] <GreyHeartedHero> You hit leveling again
[3:26:23] <bestwaifuritsu> fuck yeah Garuda
[3:26:25] <%umbypokochan> @KalMyre oh snap!
[3:26:25] <Angry_Ev1L> "bans"
[3:26:30] <metrying> arounding it LUL
[3:26:31] <$SleepyMaribo> YEA GARUDA!!!
[3:26:32] <%ESP_ROOT> SourPls
[3:26:33] <MC_GigglePants> SourPls
[3:26:33] <+RushUnplugged> parsing can be a great SELF-improvement tool, but people judge others for it, and that's awful
[3:26:35] <ColRedyx> Your DPS isn't the ONLY thing that matters, but it DOES matter.
[3:26:36] <Kekon3> yeah, we ACT in raid, we need to see everyones numbers and figure out how to optimize our healing, where we can place stuff
[3:26:36] <%WheatlyXT> cause they can get banned for it easily
[3:26:37] <Bad1uck> oooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOO
[3:26:37] <DRAGKUDO> Sorry I missed it but what is parsing
[3:26:38] <Maids4lyfe> forgive me for being dumb but what is parsing?
[3:26:38] <$Valdorick> Oh look, it is the lady from FF15!
[3:26:38] <+Sendaar> I mean I use ACT but I keep my silent judgement to myself
[3:26:38] <%ecolli37108> Garuda song <3
[3:26:38] <+HelloImTom08> nice roulette SourPls
[3:26:39] <+arfsm95> shit that music is dope
[3:26:40] <+RushUnplugged> GARUDA hype music
[3:26:42] <@absolute_weapon> This is my next Primal
[3:26:42] <Zepik> haha I do that once a week
[3:26:42] <IndoorSitup> Witcher 3 ass music.
[3:26:43] <%galaxyswirl> HI BURD MOMMY
[3:26:44] <%ESP_ROOT> 4Head hahaha
[3:26:46] <+Vruet> at least its a fast one
[3:26:47] <zamzoph> Is this Dark Souls?
[3:26:51] <Angry_Ev1L> Square knows that raiding community think their "ban" on parses is dumb so they usually do not enforce it EVER
[3:26:53] <Kekon3> SourPls
[3:26:54] <bestwaifuritsu> NOW FALL
[3:26:55] <+Silentman0> the best healer parse: number of people who died. if it's 0, you parsed well
[3:26:56] <garbageheaphound> NOW FALL
[3:27:06] <%WheatlyXT> but parsing is helpful to people to help them improve themselves. But it's a problem when they're picking on others
[3:27:08] <Kekon3> We have any BTTV specialty gifs in here?
[3:27:09] <%SolidusRex> Give her a Full Thrust
[3:27:09] <+StrawberryPantsu> Ninja Gaiden music
[3:27:19] <Angry_Ev1L> I think they MUST add ingame parser for SAVAGE raids
[3:27:20] <HeadsHeldHigh> Garuda is a cute
[3:27:26] <TheEvilOmega> @Silentman0 Except the dummies that stand there and eat crap all day. Can't heal stupid.
[3:27:26] <%Octakon910> ah i think its set to renew auto better imo i would most likely forget to manually renew
[3:27:34] <haisho> it's really useful, but people use it for the wrong reasons
[3:27:35] <+StrawberryPantsu> Exactly why they aren't adding an official one
[3:27:37] <sethhilburn> has anyone found proof that pat is real btw?
[3:27:37] <+lucaflow> Get used to missing trick attack
[3:27:38] <Psyramics> It's just a tool, and like any other tool, shitheels will abuse it
[3:27:38] <Kekon3> I use it to route our healing in o12s rn
[3:27:38] <pillshead> Garuda's the best girl
[3:27:41] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat use it dont abuse it
[3:27:43] <ColRedyx> They do enforce the parser ban, but only if you're using it to harass people.
[3:27:46] <$Valdorick> Let's put it this way - square bans it, but the top FCs use it.
[3:27:57] <%FreyRune> it's also the reason why they don't have chat enabled on pvp feast because square enix knows people would get toxic
[3:27:57] <GypsySquid> Damage is not mechanics.
[3:27:57] <TerryTheTurret> It's good for people that actually need it, not so much for everyone else.
[3:27:58] <Kekon3> You can see every cast, when it was cast, where it was cast, how much it did
[3:28:00] <%MegboyManuel> @AngriestPat your parsing talk is starting to scare me off 8 mans. And im in Aether
[3:28:00] <$Valdorick> Also lets put it this way... The FCs KNOW HOW TO USE IT... the toxic fucks don't.
[3:28:05] <Angry_Ev1L> ALl this muh toxicity arguments are dumb. Shitters that do not want to learn their rotation and go into savage raids in hope they'll be carried are just as toxic
[3:28:08] <+KalMyre> Square only bans if you harass people basically
[3:28:16] <zamzoph> Do you even lift?
[3:28:23] <+Ell1ot> Pat, do you have the fat cat mount?
[3:28:24] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat i don't know if you saw but i did three hundre push ups.
[3:28:27] <+Tsarwerewolf> Is this how an mmo do?
[3:28:33] <sumire_gelato> doton why
[3:28:34] <%Verd_254> so you can parse so long as you basically don't share that info?
[3:28:38] <Angry_Ev1L> And now they'll use dancer and it';ll be a shitshow Kappa
[3:28:38] <+Silentman0> whenever i report someone, the only thing i see the option for reporting is real money transactions
[3:28:39] <+AlphaAgito> Or like the punch machine or scanners in Dragon Ball - tells you how hard you can hit/ energy level but not how good a fighter you are
[3:28:40] <+KalMyre> @Verd_254 yes
[3:28:41] <+StrawberryPantsu> SE only bans Parcing and Visual mods if you openly talk about them
[3:28:42] <Psyramics> Wait, are these people bragging about parses on training dummies?
[3:28:44] <+Tsarwerewolf> Where's Elmo?
[3:28:55] <+StrawberryPantsu> Bots are an outright ban
[3:28:56] <Angry_Ev1L> @Psyramics generally no, tho I bet such people exist
[3:29:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> is that a waifu
[3:29:01] <+KalMyre> @Verd_254 basically dont tell square you are parsing, then you are fine. ive even seen streamers who parse
[3:29:01] <+Ell1ot> would you get the fat cat mount if it looked like Elmo?
[3:29:06] <%allouttajuice> Literally this stuff only matter for top 5% of players usually. Everyone else that uses these for any justification are usually just bads trying to cover for their bad
[3:29:06] <+StrawberryPantsu> Ungermax
[3:29:07] <MC_GigglePants> Elmo is on the couch next to pat
[3:29:09] <Psyramics> that's stupid! those numbers are worthless!
[3:29:09] <%MegboyManuel> Should I even bother with 8 mans if it's that terrible? Im in Aether too
[3:29:10] <%Octakon910> what is parcing?
[3:29:12] <+KoyaMusa> imagine not prioritizing safe practicing of mechanics and consistent clears over good parse
[3:29:16] <%TheAverageSimon> The PF can be really toxic sometimes
[3:29:17] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> gotta get that high parse on a level 1 training dummy
[3:29:17] <haisho> they'll brag about their parses on anything as long as it has big numbers.
[3:29:19] <+Tsarwerewolf> Kill Garuda, she's only a decent frame!
[3:29:25] <+Tsarwerewolf> Wisp is better!
[3:29:27] <bestwaifuritsu> toxicity is almost exclusive to the american xiv scene too, its disgusting. ask a japanese world firster about how they feel about playing a sub optimal class for a raid and they laugh and say because its fun.
[3:29:29] <ColRedyx> @Angry_Ev1L It's hard for a lot of people to see that it's a two-way street. Hurt feelings hurt, but trying to be an MMO socialist just wastes people's actual time. If you care to get better, you will.
[3:29:29] <%allouttajuice> @MegboyManuel it's only a small subset, find a decent FC/group of friends to raid with and you'll be fine
[3:29:34] <+clansnevets> What's the PVP scene like?
[3:29:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ???
[3:29:45] <%allouttajuice> @bestwaifuritsu wasn't world first UCoB with DRK MT?
