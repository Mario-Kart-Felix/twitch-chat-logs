[0:37:13] <%solracc25> not doom
[0:37:13] <Gorgs7> this is just doom/bulletstorm
[0:37:13] <Illithid72> 60 is good. You guys don't know what Shadow Warrior is?
[0:37:16] <MacchiatoCappuccino> titandoomin' it up
[0:37:16] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> it's already better than that new war hammer game
[0:37:20] <%TheYellowcouch> you're doing great pat
[0:37:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Just Like old Times, Shadow Warrior coming out as a Doom Clone with wild shit in it
[0:37:22] <ForrestKrump> good music tho
[0:37:25] <xXJuffelXx> @LionKagura Didn't see it, my b
[0:37:27] <%Lion_kun> they're doing the doom knock off on purpose
[0:37:27] <+VCRUZZO> thats a bit better
[0:37:27] <+Shonen_hero> This is just a region specific Doom
[0:37:28] <@SoFarFetched> IT LITERALLY DOES
[0:37:28] <+SirSleepy> why does this look like a cgi prerendered trailer
[0:37:28] <JoseIbAr96> too loud
[0:37:28] <%TIME_PUNCHER> is this the birth of the doom like
[0:37:28] <+Slattsquatch> We brining back the term "Doom clones" now
[0:37:28] <+InternetShis> Doom Eternity
[0:37:30] <%Varlinator> Chunky
[0:37:30] <OdysseyKnight> Video still overpowering you Pat
[0:37:31] <neraren> Doom but Glory Kills give you the enemy's weapon
[0:37:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> Too much to be gameplay
[0:37:32] <+nazzynoeyes> Cartoony DOOM clone
[0:37:32] <%Ipsenscastle> can't hear you very well
[0:37:33] <dapperskeleton69> IT LOOKS GREAT
[0:37:33] <+takotoots> rooPog

[0:37:34] <%mikesapartment> Walmart Doom
[0:37:36] <+dayz1003> well shadow warrior was a "doom clone" originally
[0:37:37] <%TheYellowcouch> this looks so pre3
[0:37:38] <+Cuzeen> It IS!
[0:37:38] <TSBasilisk> That was my thought too; lot more cartoony tha the previous ones
[0:37:39] <Rojahh> Polish Asia is cool and loud
[0:37:40] <angelpecab> still too loud
[0:37:41] <%PomegranateKing> Oh god it's Garbage: The Game
[0:37:41] <ergulor> the second one was basically asian borderlands so whatever
[0:37:42] <+D00msDayDan> that's just a mancubus
[0:37:43] <T_Sasquatch> its funny because shadow warrior is a doom clone but shadow warrior 1 wasnt this overt
[0:37:44] <+RickyDicklander> doom 5ever
[0:37:44] <+fetrigon> maybe needs more hitstop?
[0:37:46] <Louie_Salmon> Everyone should steal from doom
[0:37:46] <%ape_hawk> that l;ooks cool
[0:37:47] <dan_g_v> Wang?
[0:37:49] <+NeonLight> Everyone saying it looks like Doom, so yeah, Id say it looks like Shadow Warrior
[0:37:49] <hayeseveryone> still loud
[0:37:49] <+678saintglock> this is just such a departure from the previous ones

[2:00:38] <%Ne1son> @BarujaraciGaming Probably more complicated than that but you do you man
[2:00:40] <Profmcstevie> @devanmuse we just went right in and jumped in an elevator dude, then you're all caught up
[2:01:02] <+nazzynoeyes> I hate that fucking sleeve thing shes wearing. The design would be perfect if she wasnt wearing that
[2:01:03] <Saltmeisterr> why we in slow mode?
[2:01:09] <+red_cuppa> waltzed right on in!
[2:01:12] <@SoFarFetched> slow mode isn't on
[2:01:15] <%BarujaraciGaming> @ne1son literally not at all lmfao
[2:01:17] <+red_cuppa> aw i like the padded armor sleeve
[2:01:17] <Sunstalker> @Saltmeisterr Do you mean paige? Kappa
[2:01:29] <BlackStarAura> I never understood Yuffie’s one stocking
[2:01:30] <Srthunda> I love it tho
[2:01:32] <devanmuse> Between this and Cloud & co taking the stairs, I'm surprised how lax Shinra security is
[2:01:34] <Saltmeisterr> wait really?
[2:01:35] <%ComfortableStranger> surprise attack!
[2:01:39] <%caramelatte1> Well its an armguard for melee attacks
[2:01:41] <%TimetodiveLTX> it's like a really long shield i guess
[2:01:44] <+nazzynoeyes> Is exactly why I hate it :)
[2:01:44] <Killtastic454> It's anime it's fiiinnne
[2:01:45] <%Pappajimbo> a blade deflector??
[2:01:47] <%DianaTheAscian> wow thats dumb
[2:01:47] <Saltmeisterr> oh weird
[2:01:48] <%Dakuu75> how does that help, if you catch it with your hand- ya'know, w/e
[2:01:52] <ChungusQuest> It looks nice and plush, at least. Probably good for spontaneous napping.
[2:01:54] <Saltmeisterr> was slow mode on before?
[2:01:56] <%ExpressNode> I love the way she just jumps on the bench
[2:01:58] <OnonokiNonon> plop
[2:02:02] <StarlitStunner> cute animations
[2:02:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yuffie just hates symmetry
[2:02:05] <+gooeylouie101> she dresses like a dumb baby bc she is one
[2:02:07] <+CookieCutter007> what about her other arm
[2:02:07] <Saltmeisterr> it was still stuck like that for me
[2:02:08] <guiltyboya> Her charadesign is extra meeeeh. Also suffers from FF jpop lolita syndrome, the one that manifested since FFX
[2:02:14] <%Kirby_Sauce> there's even a metal protrusion for parries
[2:02:22] <Saltmeisterr> also have a missed any fort condor?
[2:02:26] <olwe123> her re-design in Advent children was way better
[2:02:28] <MomokaAzuka> Wait did I miss the Devolver show?
[2:02:33] <Sokumotanaka> I wonder what vincent is gonna do?
[2:02:35] <+michingmallecho> she was designed before FFX
[2:02:38] <Saltmeisterr> @MomokaAzuka ye
[2:02:38] <+AutechreTwinAphex> her character design is fine - the moogle poncho is also a good design
[2:02:41] <+red_cuppa> @MomokaAzuka yeah
[2:02:43] <devanmuse> @Saltmeisterr You missed ALL the Fort Condor
[2:02:48] <+CelioHogane> @Sokumotanaka Sleep
[2:02:49] <ChungusQuest> I like her design, just wish she'd fucking button her damn pants.
[2:02:57] <HotMafia81> I'm a vert active drunk
[2:02:58] <%Pappajimbo> oof
[2:03:00] <%Ne1son> Fort Condor is the best
[2:03:01] <%AzureGale> Old Macdonald had an armory, E-I-E-I-O
[2:03:02] <%ComfortableStranger> Yuffie is ready for a B&E
[2:03:03] <%JobbedBone> it looks like the fabric is doped, the way they used to use to make aircraft
[2:03:06] <Saltmeisterr> @Saltmeisterr i mean this stream. i watched last stream
[2:03:10] <David_de_Bergerac> that's fucking Jimmy Neutron
[2:03:13] <dan_g_v> wait, they put his dad in jail in this timeline?

[2:03:30] <+griffball13> MOMMY
[2:03:32] <majindusto> GODO IN JAIL? enigmaKEK
[2:03:42] <%Dakuu75> was she watching them break boxes for 5 min before speaking up? lol
[2:03:43] <%JobbedBone> warm liquid goo phase: commence
[2:03:51] <%Mr_Pylon> oh no slug rays!
[2:03:55] <%AzureGale> Classic Final Fantasy enemies Cutter and Slug Ray
[2:03:55] <tolloponik> GREEN
[2:03:56] <Owkono> we need more scarlet
[2:03:57] <+AutechreTwinAphex> wasn't her dad the emperor? how can he be in jail?
[2:03:58] <%ComfortableStranger> cutters have emotional problems
[2:04:08] <+megaman_sentinel> so she IN charge of tech?
[2:04:11] <jorniev> i really hope we get to SLAP the shit out of scarlet with tifa in the sequel
[2:04:14] <+nazzynoeyes> Yuffie is a straight up Power Ranger
[2:04:19] <+michingmallecho> Use chidori, Yuffie KomodoHype
[2:04:27] <%Dakuu75> idk, when I think "FF monster" I instantly think of Malboro and Toneberry
[2:04:35] <%Pappajimbo> mommy milkers mode activate
[2:04:39] <+vaderxyz1970> isnt this an Az is la heavy mech from 14?
[2:04:44] <%JobbedBone> warm liquid goo phase: com-
[2:04:48] <verscoll> Don't forget trick attack Kappa
[2:05:08] <David_de_Bergerac> they WERE alive
[2:05:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The Dual-Techs are very cool, hope we see more of them in future FF7Rs
[2:05:24] <%itschickenscratch> gun gun gun trick sword trick trick royal guard
[2:05:38] <guiltyboya> I liked how Scarlet just went "oh well, I guess I'd better get going" and peaced out during that one scene with the experiment going wrong
[2:05:42] <Profmcstevie> I appreciate the general rule of "if air Wind, if monster Ice, if people Fire, if robot Lightning"
[2:05:52] <+RowenCleric> I like Max's prediction where part 2 will start with the flashback and Sephiroth will be AI like Sonen
[2:05:52] <%AzureGale> Little-
[2:05:58] <Sunstalker> I wish they would a Chrono Trigger with a budget like these FF remakes
[2:05:58] <+AutechreTwinAphex> will be a lot of work though giving all the characters dual tech moves
[2:06:05] <+RowenCleric> have some cool dual techs in there
[2:06:06] <%Ranryu692> someone spent money to have a plane skywrite "Joe Rogan is literally 5 foot 3" over LA
[2:06:13] <Saltmeisterr> i mean it is an IK
[2:06:16] <%ComfortableStranger> @Sunstalker ikr
[2:06:20] <%maenos2> LUL

[2:10:25] <Crimpson> Run like a Chocobo
[2:10:25] <+michingmallecho> Choco choco chocobo
[2:10:30] <+UKOrigin> think thatll be a combo quote in pt 2
[2:10:31] <MicrotonalMatt> Someone needs to lock Tetsuya Nomura in the Kingdom Hearts closet and throw away the key
[2:10:33] <+MelodyMedley> Sting like a...?
[2:10:36] <no123450n> moonlogic one-liners
[2:10:37] <%NateyBeak> like "run like a chicken"
[2:10:37] <%bevyrage> i think it was a bad reading of the line

[2:10:41] <$lumporr> sting like a
[2:10:42] <$lumporr> clod

[2:10:43] <%Kirby_Sauce> run like a chocobo, sting like a something else
[2:10:44] <$apolitenoob> Is there a follow up you're just not getting to play?
[2:10:47] <Owkono> curse you playstation 5 for not existing
[2:10:51] <Crimpson> She means she can run fast like a chocobo

[2:11:08] <+AutechreTwinAphex> materia(l) girl
[2:11:17] <monopolyman001> people will blame everything on nomura for everything ff for the rest of time it seems
[2:11:19] <%Ne1son> Yuffie can have a little MAteria as a treat
[2:11:34] <%Dakuu75> looks like that engine-boss form RE village
[2:11:36] <+MelodyMedley> Sweet sweet materia
[2:11:37] <+nazzynoeyes> I liddle widdle bit ov matewia uwuw
[2:11:37] <+vaderxyz1970> Why does Eufiee say materia like an addict would say crack
[2:11:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Shiny
[2:11:53] <+Shonen_hero> I need to see more of this Yuffie to get a better idea of her. Not sure how I feel yet
[2:11:57] <+CelioHogane> Wait how the fuck did shinra have SUCH AN SPECIFIC MATERIA
[2:12:02] <Sunstalker> Look at this bitcoin farm
[2:12:03] <MicrotonalMatt> Ok ok maybe you can give him the key. He won’t...you know, use it to open the door
[2:12:04] <+MelodyMedley> Huh
[2:12:08] <%MrBorisMakarov> FAST BALL SPECIAL
[2:12:08] <monopolyman001> because of her backstory, you learn why she likes materia so much in the original
[2:12:09] <+MelodyMedley> That's specific
[2:12:10] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA FASTBALL
[2:12:14] <%ape_hawk> ...why was shinra making a NINJA materia?
[2:12:14] <%Dakuu75> is that a fucking FAST BALL SPECIAL?! lol
[2:12:19] <DejaraUndead> fastball speacial
[2:12:20] <+Shonen_hero> but why
[2:12:22] <+nazzynoeyes> Wutai also had ninjas :)
[2:12:32] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt read the description the button is weird
[2:12:34] <+nazzynoeyes> *shinra
[2:12:36] <%AzureGale> Is this The Matrix
[2:12:52] <+MelodyMedley> It's gotta
[2:12:52] <%ape_hawk> Aerith throws Barret at some dudes
[2:12:57] <+AutechreTwinAphex> the new lighting is a huge upgrade over ps4
[2:13:02] <hairtoday> equip unused party members as sync partners
[2:13:03] <Owkono> party LB style
[2:13:12] <Profmcstevie> It's all a matter of who synergises with who
[2:13:24] <%Monkeyweed21> R1 triangle while synergized
[2:13:33] <+nazzynoeyes> Just realised we might see some of FF16 at the Square Enix event soon
[2:13:41] <%RAWPowerStudios> Mods check @rockybottom123 ? Spam message above?
[2:13:45] <+MelodyMedley> So far this brand new stuff hasn't been too bad
[2:13:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Clouds hits Cait Sith with the buster sword like he's playing baseball
[2:13:51] <Profmcstevie> oooh I do like meticulous industrial lighting
[2:13:53] <+AutechreTwinAphex> would be so hype if they show something tomorrow
[2:13:59] <%RAWPowerStudios> Following since an hour ago?
[2:14:05] <%Kirby_Sauce> it should keep track of your synergize tally, and use that to decide if it kills aerith or tifa
[2:14:15] <%Kirby_Sauce> or both
[2:14:21] <%maenos2> @rawpowerstudios lol I had to scroll up for that hah
[2:14:27] <monopolyman001> the square event has so much potential tomorrow. the triple triangle octopath lookin game, ff7, ff17, dq news and who knows what else.
[2:14:32] <+CelioHogane> It probably smells like gems
[2:14:33] <+Shonen_hero> I bet you Cloud and Tifa synergize, and then they kill her in the middle of act 2 for maximum mechanic and narrative heart break
[2:14:35] <nicversus> it's Yuffie's nose candy
[2:14:36] <+MelodyMedley> That's weird
[2:14:41] <AllenDeadman> probably smells like processed mako?
[2:14:41] <%Valdorick> Makes sense. Rocks have a scent... so the souls of the dead crystalized likely would too
[2:14:42] <+michingmallecho> She’s thirsting for the materia
[2:14:46] <monopolyman001> 16 not 17 of course
[2:14:47] <StarlitStunner> Isn't it condensed lifestream-lifeforce?
[2:14:49] <@commanderclaw> Can't wait to see what the fuck Babylon's fall is
[2:14:57] <%AzureGale> Nintendo's will probably be pretty sick too
[2:14:58] <+MelodyMedley> Looking forward to that SE event
[2:14:59] <KainZero0> Just like how darkness in kh has a smell Kappa
[2:15:00] <+CelioHogane> @monopolyman001 FF16, not 17... unless.
[2:15:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yuffie has a very strong sense of smell
[2:15:03] <guiltyboya> Imagine sniffing materia like cocaine Kreygasm
[2:15:07] <%ComfortableStranger> Yuffie is a klepto
[2:15:13] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Yuffie already a teen drug addict.
[2:15:27] <@SoFarFetched> @RAWPowerStudios Thanks for the heads up. Seems like thats the only "spam" message for now. But will keep an eye on it.
[2:15:30] <+CelioHogane> @guiltyboya How do you think Jessie's father got Mako poisoning? Kappa
[2:15:34] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Materia is a hell of a drug
[2:15:37] <+nazzynoeyes> Im hoping, that maybe, just maybe, if the stars alighn, that Square Enix does the right thing, and announces a new Deus Ex game.
[2:15:39] <+teelor32> who voices yuffie?
[2:15:40] <balthazar758> literal magic mushrooms
[2:15:46] <%AzureGale> LET'S DANCE
[2:15:48] <+Ghufufin> soooo are Yuffie and Kasumi the same character?
[2:15:50] <guiltyboya> @CelioHogane It makes too much sense
[2:15:53] <+MelodyMedley> Soldiers!
[2:16:00] <%AzureGale> This is a Square-ass mix
[2:16:03] <%Daxalog> Would casting Steal on any of these guys yeild anything?
[2:16:03] <+AutechreTwinAphex> the music has been consistently excellent for this dlc too - don't know how they pull it off so well
[2:16:32] <+AutechreTwinAphex> same rank as Roche?
[2:16:40] <+CelioHogane> Third class soldier, they are loosers!
[2:16:44] <+MelodyMedley> Yeah, Roche rank
[2:16:50] <+nazzynoeyes> Very weak ass soldiers
[2:16:56] <%JohnAtDawn> Huh? Roche is Third
[2:16:56] <+MelodyMedley> Oh
[2:17:00] <+CelioHogane> No, Roche was third rank too
[2:17:01] <%JohnAtDawn> Cause he's wild
[2:17:02] <+red_cuppa> yeah roche is a 2nd class
[2:17:06] <majindusto> Roche is 3rd
[2:17:07] <+red_cuppa> it says so oon his cutscene
[2:17:08] <+MelodyMedley> I thought Roche was third
[2:17:13] <%Movemeister> preety sure Roche was 3rd
[2:17:17] <+senfood> Third class are still beasts. Just not as beastlike as the other classes.
[2:17:33] <olwe123> I meant your age, not your god damn rank
[2:17:38] <+CelioHogane> Roche is clearly way stronger than a third class, tho
[2:17:41] <mybigmeech> Cloud is first, right?
[2:17:42] <tattleworm> roche gains extra strength from his hair
[2:17:43] <GManx0> Roche has to be a cosplayer of a Soldier. Kinda like Cloud
[2:17:44] <majindusto> Roche  is PEAK 3rd
[2:17:46] <+nazzynoeyes> Guys we need to find and catch all the rare SOLDIERS like pokemon
[2:17:47] <%BarujaraciGaming> pat your fiance keeps liking thirst traps on Twitter and I don't have the patience for hard pp right now pls tell her to stop it
[2:17:52] <+RowenCleric> he should be 2nd but is 3rd because hes a crazy asshole right
[2:17:52] <%RAWPowerStudios> Was Zach the only 2nd Class canon?
[2:17:55] <+CelioHogane> @mybigmeech ...sure
[2:18:07] <+MelodyMedley> Yeah, Roche probably should be 2nd
[2:18:18] <%RAWPowerStudios> I mean Zach initially.
[2:18:23] <+red_cuppa> i guess zack was the only 2nd class we've seen then, yeah
[2:18:24] <ChungusQuest> Maybe Roche is like that asshole hero from One Punch Man, gatekeeping the top of the lower rank so that only Cool Dudes get to advance.
[2:18:31] <+red_cuppa> before he got promoted
[2:18:34] <monopolyman001> its been so long but i thought zack got promoted in crisis core but wasn it 3rd to 2nd or 2nd to 1st
[2:18:37] <nicversus> it's a giant gunpla
[2:18:39] <+MelodyMedley> ooo
[2:18:40] <%Movemeister> love fighting these guys
[2:18:45] <+ratreborn> what time did he start streaming?
[2:18:56] <+MelodyMedley> #
[2:18:58] <%Dakuu75> I die a lot in RPGs when I go, "Nah, I won't use a healing item, i'll just keep going till I find a save point, surely there's one right around the corner." nope. dead.
[2:18:59] <+red_cuppa> zack got promoted 2nd to 1st class in crisis core
[2:19:00] <%Daxalog> Steal the core huh?
[2:19:01] <+MelodyMedley> Stronk
[2:19:03] <+CelioHogane> @monopolyman001 Well Zack definetly died as a first class, so...
[2:19:13] <Jrocy247> Is that a a fucking Gundam?
[2:19:18] <+nazzynoeyes> Personally, looking back at it, there really wasn't enough 911 talk at the Devolver Conference for tastes.
[2:19:18] <+ratreborn> he hasnt beaten the dlc yet has he?
[2:19:20] <+griffball13> chesto fiya
[2:19:26] <no123450n> ohhhh its a "float like a butterfly" thing
[2:19:28] <%Jekado> GOONdam
[2:19:29] <+MelodyMedley> That sure looks like a mini gundam
[2:19:29] <@SoFarFetched> nope he hasnt
[2:19:31] <%Dakuu75> Look at this PSO2 mech-guy
[2:19:33] <Jrocy247> No actually, it looks like Soundwave from Transformers
[2:19:33] <no123450n> god damn
[2:19:36] <+nazzynoeyes> IS THAT SHOCKWAVE?
[2:19:36] <+CelioHogane> @ratreborn no
[2:19:37] <+Shonen_hero> is it wrong to want the Magitrooper to win?
[2:19:37] <@SoFarFetched> this is still his first time playing the DLC.
[2:19:37] <+red_cuppa> @ratreborn no
[2:19:40] <%RAWPowerStudios> Yeah so Zack is the only character I can think of that was a canon 2nd Class Soldier at some point lol.
[2:19:41] <+nazzynoeyes> From transformers?
[2:19:44] <+ratreborn> thanks
[2:19:46] <Sokumotanaka> KILLED HIM
[2:19:56] <+red_cuppa> was kunsel also 2nd class?
[2:20:13] <@SoFarFetched> just smash the bottle onto his face so it heals better geefDense
[2:20:21] <+CelioHogane> THE FUCK IS THAT
[2:20:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Cool
[2:20:22] <Profmcstevie> Clearly Yuffie needs more arm...muffler....things for defence
[2:20:23] <dan_g_v> so that's a problem
[2:20:24] <+ratreborn> look at that Jaeger
[2:20:25] <henshinforpie> Hmm I wonder if you'll fight that later?
[2:20:25] <$apolitenoob> IS THAT A PACIFIC RIM JAEGER

[2:21:05] <+senfood> Oh, that as the Proud Clod.
[2:21:07] <+Shonen_hero> but cool robitt
[2:21:10] <nicversus> Man, I'm not seeing how this couldn't have been on PS4 too. I mean it's clearly better on PS5, but I'm salty
[2:21:27] <Zap_Rowsdower32> PRECIOUUUUUSSSSSS
[2:21:34] <+red_cuppa> they didn't know the shortage would hit ;; at least that was my understanding.
[2:21:35] <guiltyboya> she's obsessed
[2:21:40] <%ComfortableStranger> why isn't Paige on this stream? isn't she the ruby weapon?
[2:21:46] <+red_cuppa> i think it's supposed to be the proud cloud
[2:21:47] <%Dakuu75> *shrugs*
[2:21:50] <+ratreborn> Proudclod
[2:21:50] <%MrBorisMakarov> what
[2:21:50] <+Chronobot> yes
[2:21:52] <SomersaultJustice> Proud Klobb
[2:21:52] <%athuramn> I dunno
[2:21:55] <+red_cuppa> and just. you know. mistranslations
[2:21:56] <monopolyman001> pretty sure it was translation error and its proud cloud
[2:21:57] <%WutangchickeN> it's the pao kai
[2:21:58] <ammobasket> either way is weird
[2:21:58] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Yuffie is JPRG Gollum
[2:21:59] <+MelodyMedley> Who knows?
[2:22:01] <tattleworm> jp name was the Proud Clad
[2:22:02] <%LaughingCatt> its supposed to be Proud-clad, i believe
[2:22:02] <Profmcstevie> This proud are sick
[2:22:05] <Zap_Rowsdower32> *JRPG
[2:22:06] <+senfood> I mean, the people who use it are proud cllods.
[2:22:07] <%Movemeister> the prod clod
[2:22:08] <%MugenSandan> Okay but stupid is good
[2:22:08] <%Garthunox> Its supposed to be Proud CLAD
[2:22:12] <%Dakuu75> "Proudclod" sounds like something Peridot would say
[2:22:12] <%Bmrandfriends> oh no
[2:22:15] <%Bmrandfriends> \not this
[2:22:17] <+ratreborn> its box time
[2:22:22] <nicversus> @red_cuppa Sure, but in past interviews they'd even said they were gonna support the PS4 with future releases, so it kinda sucks that they changed their minds
[2:22:22] <%Bmrandfriends> this took me hours
[2:22:23] <%BarujaraciGaming> plaid crab
[2:22:24] <+ratreborn> we're gonna be here a while
[2:22:27] <Teyaric> Clad in Pride
[2:22:31] <StarlitStunner> MATERIA! Get!
[2:22:33] <%Bmrandfriends> \
[2:22:34] <+fusionsdf> ultimania says プラウド・クラッド so proud clad
[2:22:35] <%ExpressNode> @nicversus I think there are very distinct differences sometimes we forget that the PS4 is almost 8 years old.
[2:22:38] <+MelodyMedley> Hacker Yuffie
[2:22:41] <Owkono> it wouldn't be so bad if there were consoles available to buy, and not sold out everywhere
[2:22:41] <MicrotonalMatt> Plowed Clod
[2:22:43] <%Bmrandfriends> welcome back to the minigame stream
[2:22:59] <majindusto> Good Luck
[2:23:02] <%psidefx> You member this
[2:23:02] <tattleworm> beat up them boxes
[2:23:06] <+griffball13> do combo
[2:23:06] <%Bmrandfriends> look right at the start
[2:23:07] <+fusionsdf> but that clad is pronounced more like Claude than anything else
[2:23:07] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Yuffie really hates boxes
[2:23:08] <%Movemeister> woo box smashing time
[2:23:09] <$apolitenoob> Do break box good
[2:23:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh neat, this one again
[2:23:10] <%athuramn> oh no, the boxes ones blow xx
[2:23:11] <olwe123> BOX TIME
[2:23:12] <%DianaTheAscian> this again
[2:23:12] <+MelodyMedley> Box breaking!
[2:23:14] <reonome> i love this game
[2:23:16] <mybigmeech> Evil within 2 vibes
[2:23:17] <iosephe> It
[2:23:17] <%Valdorick> MOG IS PART OF THE SYSTEM!?
[2:23:17] <Zap_Rowsdower32> She and Solid Snake can never be friends
[2:23:18] <iosephe> YES
[2:23:27] <%nevan_44> FUCK EM UP
[2:23:28] <+red_cuppa> @nicversus i thought they said they were going back now because they can't hit sales bc everything happened after those interviews came out. like originally everything was going to be next gen only and now they're back tracking because data chips or whatever?
[2:23:31] <moosemonkey397> @PatStaresAt red boxes are weak to physical, blue weak to magic
[2:23:33] <%psidefx> Nice Chakram
[2:23:36] <+Shonen_hero> yo I love this minigame
[2:23:40] <dan_g_v> so, is there anything interesting for E3 for today, or it's done already?
[2:23:41] <nicversus> @ExpressNode and yet it supported a very powerful game, unrelated to this, you might have heard of it but it's kind of obscure. It's called Final Fantasy VII Remake
[2:23:44] <+senfood> Yuffie's battle music slaps so damn hard!
[2:23:46] <MicrotonalMatt> Smash them all kupo
[2:23:47] <balthazar758> box
[2:23:53] <+og_lunchbox> wait she got them FF14 mudras
[2:23:53] <%baronblank> Getting the final reward for this mini game is ridiculous
[2:23:58] <no123450n> Break the targets!
[2:24:08] <+RowenCleric> yes most likely part 2 and ff16 will be on ps4 because of the ps5 shortage/co-vid
[2:24:11] <+red_cuppa> @nicversus either way i agree i wish i could be playing this right now ;~;
[2:24:13] <%Bmrandfriends> use the thrown weapon windstorm
[2:24:18] <%Bmrandfriends> on 1500 boxes
[2:24:22] <%Movemeister> PogChamp
[2:24:29] <%Valdorick> Yeyeyeyeye Crushing it
[2:24:34] <@SoFarFetched> E3 is still going on I believe,just Pat didn't care for anything else except the Devolver part.
[2:24:39] <+lojack69> Theres no time ghosts involved in the yuffie side story is there?
[2:24:41] <soliammurr> is that fucking ten chi jin??
[2:24:45] <+MelodyMedley> Damn Pat's crushing it
[2:24:49] <@SoFarFetched> But he's gonna stream E3 stuff tomorrow.
[2:25:00] <+red_cuppa> @lojack69 i mean they keep you out of seventh heaven LUL
[2:25:02] <dan_g_v> so, nothing interesting for the most part, @SoFarFetched ?
[2:25:07] <$apolitenoob> This theme fuckin RULES
[2:25:07] <T_Sasquatch> i leveled up NIN to 71 ... then saw level 80 in zadnor its not as fun as i though it would be
[2:25:07] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @lojack69 there is only one 'small' easily missed bit where you can see the presence of the ghosts, otherwise nothing
[2:25:13] <@SSaryn> At least tomorrow will actually have something. Probably.
[2:25:16] <@SoFarFetched> yeah nothing too much geefShrug at least as far as im aware
[2:25:27] <@SoFarFetched> havent heard people get super excited over things today.
[2:25:34] <tattleworm> max score on the first try, nice
[2:25:40] <%Bmrandfriends> now for the hard part
[2:25:42] <guiltyboya> FF7 : GATORADE
[2:25:42] <+griffball13> first try
[2:25:42] <+red_cuppa> damn he did really well
[2:25:48] <reonome> nice
[2:25:48] <%athuramn> this mini game is vastly improved as yuffie
[2:25:49] <dan_g_v> well, the rabbids thing got people excited before the E3, so what else
[2:25:49] <@SSaryn> R6 Extraction actually looked good and that's about it.
[2:25:49] <+MelodyMedley> Nice!
[2:25:49] <+red_cuppa> fucking got em
[2:25:50] <majindusto> GO IN AGAIN
[2:25:51] <%Valdorick> De... stryoed

[2:26:08] <%ConLin_Arts_> sbfpSetIn
[2:26:09] <dan_g_v> gotta do solordier
[2:26:10] <nicversus> SOLDIER goblins
[2:26:10] <%Bmrandfriends> look right pat
[2:26:13] <%Bmrandfriends> look right
[2:26:14] <+MelodyMedley> Ah..
[2:26:14] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oho, grinding materia
[2:26:14] <%MrP33Ps> took me two hours to beat the soldier course
[2:26:17] <dan_g_v> do it perfect, do it now now now
[2:26:17] <+Shonen_hero> Do it
[2:26:18] <%DianaTheAscian> 50000
[2:26:18] <%Dakuu75> you did it good, now do it better.
[2:26:18] <majindusto> GOOD  LUCK
[2:26:19] <+Shonen_hero> hit box
[2:26:19] <%Tearonex> getting the 50k in this is hard
[2:26:22] <+Shonen_hero> do number
[2:26:26] <+MelodyMedley> Oh boy
[2:26:28] <rhus> be prepared to literally perfect this if you want the top reward :)
[2:26:39] <+ratreborn> Pat theres a time box and couple 200's directly to the right at the start
[2:26:46] <%Valdorick> Cancel those animations
[2:26:50] <%baronblank> You have to destroy every box to get 50k, it’s crazy
[2:26:50] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 alright, i gotta sleep for work, so I'm heading to bed to cuddle my new machete i bought today. Don't worry, the scabbard has a velcro strap to keep the blade in. 'Night guys
[2:26:56] <%BarujaraciGaming> Holy shit you start with like no time at the start on this one
[2:26:59] <+AutechreTwinAphex> looking back on it, the ff7 remake characters look a lot more faithful than the re2 / re3 remake characters
[2:27:15] <guiltyboya> damn
[2:27:43] <+mrzeeks> mrzeeks subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! Hey pat question. Isn't it possible for streamers to distort audio instead of muting it to avoid DMCA?
[2:27:47] <%AngriestAngryArtist> does pat  know about the box's weakness and stuff?
[2:27:51] <@SSaryn> An Italian could do this better than Pat honestly Kappa
[2:27:54] <dan_g_v> well you need blocky characters if you want to be faithful to the original designs of FF7
[2:27:55] <guiltyboya> Did she just said to run to a bunch of crates?!
[2:27:56] <%lyzejag> This took me like 25 tries it was exhausting holy shit
[2:27:58] <%Bmrandfriends> noooo
[2:28:00] <moosemonkey397> it sfine, got the one that matters
[2:28:11] <+ratreborn> the throw and recieve is strong
[2:28:12] <%Valdorick> @SSaryn What does this even mean, SSaryn!?
[2:28:12] <%Dakuu75> dude, I was "this" close to just saying, "Just jump over the boxes and gett he time, first." lol
[2:28:15] <tattleworm> @PatStaresAt there's a time box to your right when you start
[2:28:16] <+MelodyMedley> That's a tough one
[2:28:16] <+ratreborn> boxes to the right of the start pat
[2:28:16] <dan_g_v> Only 3 more tries, right? :3
[2:28:17] <%AngriestAngryArtist> yeah 50,000 you need to get all the boxes LOL
[2:28:17] <%Bmrandfriends> welcome to the minigame stream part 2
[2:28:19] <%Tearonex> ye, still havent done the 50k
[2:28:29] <ShiningAxis> you should prioritize finding time ups so you can plan a better route
[2:28:36] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @dan_g_v what i mean is that with re2 and re3 people bitched about claire or jill's look while with ff7 people generally accept the redesigns and think they look faithful
[2:28:44] <@SSaryn> @Valdorick Idk Pat was making doing accents before and it was like haha funny joke idk
[2:28:50] <%BarujaraciGaming> wait wtf is it just me or does he have more time at the start this time?
[2:28:57] <$apolitenoob> This is Yuffie's battle theme? This SLAPS
[2:29:06] <%AzureGale> This is like the Professor Genki challenges in Saints Row 3
[2:29:07] <%Valdorick> I... that chain of thought makes sense... okay, good burn.
[2:29:08] <%Dakuu75> might be a sneaky time-box behind your starting spot. ussualy games pull that shit
[2:29:25] <tattleworm> atb assist might be a good equip here
[2:29:26] <%lyzejag> ^^
[2:29:37] <%Bmrandfriends> its to the right of the starting point
[2:29:43] <%Valdorick> Yiffy
[2:29:46] <@SoFarFetched> yuhfie
[2:29:52] <%AzureGale> There should be an HP bar on these boxes
[2:30:01] <%Valdorick> exact same score
[2:30:09] <+ratreborn> boxes to the right at the start
[2:30:09] <%BarujaraciGaming> duuuuuuuude wtaf those 1500s are ridiculous
[2:30:09] <@SoFarFetched> why does that guitar sound sad
[2:30:11] <%Dakuu75> is there a more optimal combo for those big boxes? shit takes forever
[2:30:16] <Profmcstevie> Man I do not want to optimise some fucking boxes
[2:30:17] <%AzureGale> FAILURE
[2:30:18] <majindusto> WHAT  A SHAME
[2:30:19] <%42nfl19> why you laugh @PatStaresAt ? Is Zangief bullying Paige again?
[2:30:19] <%athuramn> nailed it
[2:30:30] <+ShazBo2000> Yuffie sucks
[2:30:32] <@SSaryn> Er der Yuhfie un gun get dem merteriers
[2:30:38] <%Dakuu75> video games
[2:30:39] <+ratreborn> yay
[2:30:47] <balthazar758> 🎁
[2:30:47] <+crazyhanyou> throw at the 1500 box then use wind attack
[2:30:50] <guiltyboya> Detroy the boxes, to own Hideo Kojima
[2:30:52] <%Bane_Kaikyo> those were some cheeky boxes
[2:30:53] <@SoFarFetched> @SSaryn where's your pizza pasta hands geefDense
[2:31:12] <%Dakuu75> doodInjury
[2:31:12] <%Monkeyweed21> Imagine Sephiroth doing this shit
[2:31:16] <@SSaryn> er gum dern whatchu mean dere dang ol Burb
[2:31:21] <%baronblank> Throwing the star and then using windstorm does a ton to the big boxes for some reason
[2:31:42] <%MrP33Ps> throw shuriken with windstorm is the way
[2:31:52] <+TaylOctopus91> Yeah, I was only able to get the first of the three SOLDIER tier prizes last night. Almost feel like we need to come back on NG+
[2:31:58] <%Dakuu75> do the box colors, mean you should use certain elements?
[2:31:59] <+AutechreTwinAphex> what does she say ? 'with the power of his prophet'?
[2:32:03] <%42nfl19> I missed the start of the stream but aren't they trapped in the Shinra basement?
[2:32:18] <%Bmrandfriends> also use thrown weapon windstorm on 1500 boxes
[2:32:27] <%Eaglestrike117> just leave the 100 and 200's
[2:32:27] <%BarujaraciGaming> I think windstorm would work well in that small hallway there
[2:32:28] <%Dakuu75> @AutechreTwinAphex "by the power of his divine providence" I think
[2:32:34] <nicversus> gotdamn that's tough
[2:32:35] <+GingerStrawhat> Maybe focus more on the large boxes then all of the small ones?
[2:32:35] <%Monkeyweed21> banishment 1 does crap damage
[2:32:39] <+AutechreTwinAphex> ah
[2:32:40] <+HebbieJebbies> Just use a gun 4Head
[2:32:40] <%AzureGale> Do you have to destroy every box to reach the target score?
[2:32:42] <%ConLin_Arts_> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:32:48] <+Qsmash_> I would try going for time boxes first and breaking boxes later
[2:32:51] <@SSaryn> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:32:51] <+crazyhanyou> to get the 50k you need to get all the boxes
[2:32:51] <+red_cuppa> yeah its providence
[2:32:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Gief has come to
[2:33:01] <%ConLin_Arts_> the son
[2:33:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> Maybe you just gotta skip some to rush to those time boxes then double back
[2:33:06] <%MrP33Ps> @Eaglestrike117 you need to break all boxes in order to beat it
[2:33:18] <tanarath> Pat needs more levels /gear
[2:33:23] <+TaylOctopus91> @dakuu75 Orange are physical, Blue are magic/ninjutsu, Red is more time, and White just have a bajillion HP
[2:33:33] <%RoboticAnimeDude> yeah you need all the boxes, i noped out i just don't care enough lol
[2:33:56] <guiltyboya> who's a good doggie?
[2:33:58] <%ConLin_Arts_> Driven by hunger, the beast craves
[2:34:04] <%ZComiX> Qi think some of the boxes are traps for time

[2:34:27] <%walternatorz> this is going to be a two man job soon

[2:34:39] <%Dakuu75> I'll never be able to look at Gief the same way again, after all that high-res dogh-slime we saw earlier.
[2:34:43] <%StormBuster24> Feel like Gief could be pretty much immovable if he wanted to be
[2:34:45] <time2getsweaty> watcha doing to the dogo
[2:34:45] <%ComfortableStranger> I have to do that with my cats ears

[2:37:10] <nukle0nik> i assumed pat restreamed it

[2:37:40] <%Monkeyweed21> yea they got Zangief when he was like 8 weeks old
[2:38:05] <@SoFarFetched> @asgard147 he's been doing the boxes thing
[2:38:12] <@SoFarFetched> with a bit of progress.

[2:42:12] <%asgard147> THE BOXES MUST NOT WIN! limesHeck
[2:42:17] <%Valdorick> If people are mad about Pat doing this on DLC, just wait until *the golden saucer in the main game*
[2:42:21] <+griffball13> inb4 Max did it
[2:42:28] <+AutechreTwinAphex> sucks there isn't a way to play as her in the main campaign - the moveset is really nice
[2:42:42] <%RoboticAnimeDude> missed a box tho i think
[2:42:47] <cohnjena13> I know Yuffie has no chance in the Cloud love triangle, but hot damn do I wish she did
[2:42:56] <Uselesswhitenoise> @Valdorick I want the golden saucer to be its own entire game. just a full 60 hour experience
[2:42:58] <%TimetodiveLTX> Hope you like pain!
[2:43:02] <@SoFarFetched> wow Pat giving up? that's  coward talk geefPlz
[2:43:14] <%Mr_Pylon> it's no Fort Condor
[2:43:15] <i_chevalier> is she using monk moves too?
[2:43:17] <%sjay662> I just did it @PatStaresAt throw the star into the big boxes and use windstorm
[2:43:17] <@SoFarFetched> all in front of.......1,127 viewers
[2:43:19] <majindusto> MAX DID IT
[2:43:21] <%DashXero> Only worry about the small fries if they have time ups.
[2:43:23] <%TimetodiveLTX> nice
[2:43:26] <@SoFarFetched> YEAH
[2:43:28] <%AzureGale> Exposed!
[2:43:28] <%asgard147> I can't believe Pat cowarded out limesFeels
[2:43:29] <@SoFarFetched> MAX DID IT
[2:43:33] <%baronblank> It requires being pretty precise yea
[2:43:34] <+CelioHogane> @majindusto Did he actually did?
[2:43:34] <%ape_hawk> pat, youre doing this for an exp materia in a 10-hour dlc
[2:43:39] <+Arxel1> MAX DID IT
[2:43:41] <%Garthunox> MAX DID IT
[2:43:41] <%MrBorisMakarov> oh no
[2:43:41] <%kewlmyc> SIMPSONS DID IT
[2:43:43] <tattleworm> i am pretty sure max didn't do it
[2:43:43] <%Bmrandfriends> took me 2 hours to beat
[2:43:46] <%DashXero> He only focused on the big ones at first.
[2:43:46] <%ComfortableStranger> I honestly don't get why anyone watches max
[2:43:47] <+CelioHogane> @ape_hawk New game+ tho
[2:43:49] <%sjay662> throw the star into the big boxes and use windstorm
[2:43:52] <%za7az> @majindusto Shhhhh ;)
[2:43:54] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> by getting more points
[2:43:56] <i_chevalier> its da rule
[2:44:01] <%AzureGale> He pressed the buttons better
[2:44:01] <%Pappajimbo> the power of fatherhood
[2:44:03] <%ape_hawk> AX MID DIT
[2:44:03] <majindusto> GO BIG
[2:44:06] <%embranz> he hit the boxes until there were no boxe sleft
[2:44:08] <%GalacticaPhanto> @comfortablestranger Because they want to? and he's enjoyable?
[2:44:08] <+Arxel1> he just played better 4Head
[2:44:11] <spuginky> he got enough points
[2:44:20] <%TimetodiveLTX> he got gud pat
[2:44:28] <%ComfortableStranger> @GalacticaPhanto he's boring though
[2:44:33] <%MrP33Ps> throw star, one jutsu, windstorm did it for me
[2:44:45] <cohnjena13> I just remembered the pull up minigame...ahh, good times
[2:44:46] <+red_cuppa> to be fair. he didn't get the top one.
[2:44:50] <%RoboticAnimeDude> @ComfortableStranger entertainment and hes super enthusiastic especially about FF
[2:44:53] <%TimetodiveLTX> man this song is SourPls
[2:44:54] <%GalacticaPhanto> @comfortablestranger Entertainment is subjective, so I can respect that
[2:44:54] <%athuramn> but you still have like 2 hours to try and beat this one >:
[2:44:59] <%cvp5127> maybe ignore small boxea
[2:45:06] <TioXyco> quickly, Trick Attack the big boxes!
[2:45:10] <@SoFarFetched> Thats more of a personal preference. Some people will REALLY enjoy a thing,others won't geefShrug it happens.
[2:45:11] <%GalacticaPhanto> I've been listening to this theme for hours now and I love it
[2:45:20] <%MrP33Ps> @GalacticaPhanto yeah don't be an ass when mostly everyone here likes max
[2:45:27] <%ComfortableStranger> @RoboticAnimeDude anyone can be enthusiastic, pat is witty and funny
[2:45:29] <+ratreborn> nah, to get 50k you needa get ALL the boxes, ive attempted this for like 40 minutes
[2:45:31] <%livlinn> why she's talking to boxes?? shiaDingus
[2:45:41] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt banishment 1 sucks ass save banishment 3 for the end of the course
[2:45:48] <+mr_killed_instantly> Psychology
[2:45:51] <%ComfortableStranger> @GalacticaPhanto to each their own, I just don't see it
[2:45:56] <%GalacticaPhanto> @mrp33ps I wasn't? I like watching Max lol
[2:46:01] <+AutechreTwinAphex> I have the feeling people mostly like shitting on people once they become successful
[2:46:01] <%AzureGale> GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:46:02] <%athuramn> (and some people see the big name and want to hop in)
[2:46:23] <%MrP33Ps> @GalacticaPhanto oops wrong person lol
[2:46:23] <@SoFarFetched> Its like when I get confused on why a lot of people would watch DSP, but I guess there's something about him people would watch.
[2:46:40] <%ComfortableStranger> also I don't understand why people watch titty streamers,
[2:46:49] <i_chevalier> remember to grab the time up Pat
[2:47:00] <%za7az> @ComfortableStranger The... titties...?
[2:47:04] <+mr_killed_instantly> It's a mystery
[2:47:07] <UGD_Greyya> @ComfortableStranger because tiddies
[2:47:07] <+CelioHogane> @SoFarFetched I really can't see a reason to watch DSP, the video people make about "How not to play"? Sure those are fun, but him alone? Couldn't be unfunnier.
[2:47:09] <%GalacticaPhanto> I mean that's the beauty of streamers right? like you have so much variety so watch whatever you want to, like it doesn't bother me at all
[2:47:20] <%MrP33Ps> he got it!
[2:47:21] <%DianaTheAscian> WOW
[2:47:29] <+red_cuppa> look at him! he's coastin!!!
[2:47:36] <+AutechreTwinAphex> well it's easy to see why they watch it for the funbags, what's harder to understand is people donating a PS5 to a female streamer, that crosses over into weird and creepy
[2:47:40] <%TimetodiveLTX> DSP should give yall hope
[2:47:48] <%ComfortableStranger> but the titties aren't out, why watch a streamer when you can watch porn
[2:47:53] <+AutechreTwinAphex> there was one guy who paid a streamer girl almost $40K in donations
[2:47:58] <i_chevalier> did devoler already happen?
[2:47:59] <@SoFarFetched> Because interaction with the streamer @ComfortableStranger
[2:48:10] <@SoFarFetched> which can be quite geefCringe at times
[2:48:20] <majindusto> HE'S  BEGINNING  TO BELIEVE
[2:48:22] <i_chevalier> @autechretwinaphex I mean spend it if you got it
[2:48:24] <%GalacticaPhanto> I mean I would donate 40k if Pat showed the TRUE ORB
[2:48:27] <@SoFarFetched> People tend to develop parasocial relationships with the streamers because streamers will talk directly to you.
[2:48:33] <%ComfortableStranger> @SoFarFetched you can interact with porn too, its called camshows
[2:48:37] <%Movemeister> Pat's learned the SECRET MOVES
[2:48:43] <Uselesswhitenoise> @ComfortableStranger The most important thing in life to understand is that there is something fundamentally wrong with the human animal
[2:48:44] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @i_chevalier I'd say spending $40K on a female streamer is unnatural and a waste of money
[2:48:46] <@SoFarFetched> yeah but twitch has less viruses to deal with
[2:48:48] <%TimetodiveLTX> dai orubu
[2:48:53] <+mr_killed_instantly> Call the crates dweeb wanker idiots. x10 instant death multiplier
[2:48:54] <+AutechreTwinAphex> that guy is 100% doing it in the vain hope he can date her
[2:48:58] <ChungusQuest> Man, Every single time I see "DSP" my brain automatically assumes it stands for Dark Smoke Puncher, the idiotic pseudonym of Dr. McNinja's little brother. Why am I like this?
[2:49:01] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Did it!
[2:49:02] <cohnjena13> WE DO IT!!!
[2:49:02] <%athuramn> and twitch is kid friendly, right, right??
[2:49:03] <i_chevalier> @comfortablestranger People prefer things they can't have
[2:49:04] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> It was and you fell for it
[2:49:07] <%kewlmyc> WOOT!
[2:49:07] <+red_cuppa> banishment that center
[2:49:08] <%athuramn> right
[2:49:17] <@SoFarFetched> There's an audience for almost everything
[2:49:17] <%TimetodiveLTX> Dr. McNinja owns
[2:49:19] <%GalacticaPhanto> @chungusquest Because you have good taste
[2:49:20] <@SoFarFetched> even streams of people sleeping
[2:49:24] <%ComfortableStranger> @i_chevalier yeah I don't get that either
[2:49:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ChungusQuest I would much rather watch that DLC
[2:49:28] <%Valdorick> Clutch
[2:49:28] <%cvp5127> yeyeyeye
[2:49:30] <@SoFarFetched> or when Ludwig streamed for a month nonstop
[2:49:33] <%TimetodiveLTX> he don did it
[2:49:35] <@SoFarFetched> 24/7 streaming
[2:49:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ChungusQuest DSP FUCK
[2:49:40] <cohnjena13> YEYEYEYE
[2:49:46] <%TimetodiveLTX> get money
[2:49:47] <%Daxalog> You skipped a couple
[2:49:49] <+red_cuppa> that was smoov
[2:49:51] <+ratreborn> theres a box begind the corner of the 2 boxes before the next section
[2:49:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @AutechreTwinAphex The horny amplifies the parasocial aspect, I imagine. But I can respect the hustle, ya know?
[2:49:51] <TheSinner42> after you go up the ramp
[2:49:52] <tattleworm> i think there might be some to the right when you climb the ramp?
[2:49:55] <+AutechreTwinAphex> not every girl streamer is like this of course and it's mostly the ones who turn it into soft porn that give a bad name to everyone on the platform
[2:50:05] <+ratreborn> big white boxes*
[2:50:06] <+Koldsned> Yeah I think you need every box for the 50k
[2:50:08] <%walternatorz> bears are scary
[2:50:14] <%MrP33Ps> @PatStaresAt try to explore each area carefully. some are sneaky
[2:50:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> So why is Yuffie...coool now
[2:50:23] <cohnjena13> Is "obvious Cid prototype guy" cool?
[2:50:32] <ChungusQuest> just be perfect tho
[2:50:37] <Profmcstevie> He's not said much honestly
[2:50:44] <%ComfortableStranger> @Valentinius_Anodyne i don't fault the streamers for hustling, I'm just confused at the audiance
[2:50:44] <+CelioHogane> @cohnjena13 Yes (also tecnically Cid wouldn't play at all like Sonon)
[2:50:47] <Profmcstevie> But in terms of combat "not cid" is cool
[2:50:52] <%GalacticaPhanto> @doc_ock_rokc She has cool moves but they kept that naive dweeb attitude which is charming
[2:50:57] <%TimetodiveLTX> maybe in a few years we'll see this TASed
[2:51:04] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @Valentinius_Anodyne frankly I think the girl should have reason to be legit worried by any guy giving her $40K, you don't know what creepy ass rich stalker this is that is willing to donate essentially retirement money to her
[2:51:06] <T_Sasquatch> its funny becasue when you level up this shit is so easy
[2:51:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sonon's pretty alright. But he's definitely the straigtman is this buddy-ninja movie
[2:51:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GalacticaPhanto i guess
[2:51:21] <%ComfortableStranger> Cid is busy drinking GODDAMN TEA
[2:51:55] <%GalacticaPhanto> @comfortablestranger And hitting Shera
[2:51:58] <Profmcstevie> With this being the SOLDIER course I just imagine sephiroth running through it cleaving 5 boxes in a flick
[2:52:05] <cohnjena13> @ComfortableStranger I'm I gonna have to make you make me go into the basement, again?
[2:52:12] <%TimetodiveLTX> nooooo
[2:52:12] <%ComfortableStranger> @GalacticaPhanto exactly
[2:52:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @AutechreTwinAphex I am inclined to agree, yeah. Obsession is a dangerous thing, especially if you can afford to waste that much money on it
[2:52:17] <i_chevalier> @autechretwinaphex that's true. just cause your online, doesn't mean you are out of reach irl
[2:52:19] <TioXyco> c'mon pat, TCJ faster!
[2:52:25] <%ComfortableStranger> @cohnjena13 lol
[2:52:27] <tattleworm> looping deadly dodge on the purple boxes seems to build atb faster
[2:52:35] <%Monkeyweed21> even Max couldn't get 50K
[2:52:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> You'll never be a dark knight at this rate
[2:53:01] <%athuramn> LOL, the ninja who didn't know their rotations *tsktsk*
[2:53:20] <@SoFarFetched> internet is a strange mysterious place in general when finding out things about other people geefAwk
[2:53:25] <ChungusQuest> You can do it Pat, you're the man who beat Fort Condor with one army tied behind your back!
[2:53:28] <%GalacticaPhanto> All Pat know is Living Shadow, Living Dead and Die
[2:53:29] <@SoFarFetched> sometimes it gives us TOO much information
[2:53:50] <cohnjena13> Honestly, has anyone ever seen a midriff more AGRESSIVE than Remake Yuffie?
[2:54:02] <%DianaTheAscian> missed one
[2:54:06] <%athuramn> I went to school for psych and crim and it ruined my life about people
[2:54:11] <%GalacticaPhanto> @cohnjena13 Tifa
[2:54:13] <%ComfortableStranger> wouldn't it be cool if people were obsessed with charities and NPOs?
[2:54:38] <cohnjena13> @GalacticaPhanto Ohh, fuck...you're right
[2:54:46] <i_chevalier> @sofarfetched People also have the misconception that just your online, means you are anonymous or out of reach.
[2:55:09] <balthazar758> @comfortablestranger i can agree with that
[2:55:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @ComfortableStranger The way I see it, there's a lot of lonely people online, especially if you're desperate for attention in the sexual sense. I wish people would be willing to donate that money to organizations doing good for people, but it's probably not likely to happen
[2:55:19] <+red_cuppa> that's the way whoo!
[2:55:26] <%FreeFuzeIcedTea> FreeFuzeIcedTea subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[2:55:29] <+Ghufufin> fuck man every ep of Vivy hits hard
[2:55:31] <+red_cuppa> yes
[2:55:34] <tattleworm> you left a 1500 behind, yeah
[2:55:35] <+red_cuppa> you skipped it a room ago
[2:55:38] <%GalacticaPhanto> @cohnjena13 And even then Barret is the most aggressive with it
[2:55:38] <%AzureGale> F
[2:55:38] <+BGDoombringer> missed one box in the second area
[2:55:40] <$apolitenoob> OOF
[2:55:40] <%ComfortableStranger> @Valentinius_Anodyne I can dream
[2:55:40] <%DianaTheAscian> yes
[2:55:41] <+CelioHogane> Yeah you missed one at the beggining
[2:55:45] <Profmcstevie> The big box you failed in the first big room
[2:55:45] <+kojibeoulve> F
[2:55:47] <+red_cuppa> so CLOSE
[2:55:50] <%TimetodiveLTX> gamer install
[2:55:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ComfortableStranger If you knew anything about charities you really woudn't want them to 90% of charities are corrupt to the bone
[2:55:51] <dan_g_v> oof that is rough
[2:55:52] <%athuramn> that is tragic af
[2:55:55] <DejaraUndead> it was 1 at the very beginning
[2:55:58] <Sogeki_Dan> We playing Smash BREAK THE TARGETS now?
[2:55:58] <%BarujaraciGaming> you missed one in the first big room
[2:56:01] <%Movemeister> You're getting there
[2:56:04] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt you walked past it like 3 times
[2:56:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> I saw NOTHING
[2:56:07] <%AzureGale> Progress is being made
[2:56:08] <+red_cuppa> pat's about to come out in front of max LUL
[2:56:09] <ChungusQuest> Time to activate TURBO MODE

[2:56:14] <$apolitenoob> Shinra Boxes (Savage) prog is going well
[2:56:15] <butthurtdave> wait is pat not streaming the gearbox meltdown?
[2:56:18] <%Monkeyweed21> Gamer Girl Pat is doing big good
[2:56:21] <i_chevalier> @comfortablestranger there people who take advantage of those organizations. taking advantage of people's good will.
[2:56:34] <%ComfortableStranger> @doc_ock_rokc I work for a non profit agency that isn't corrupt so I'm biased
[2:56:35] <cohnjena13> @GalacticaPhanto Nah, man..Barret got dem big, black, beefy, bara tiddies
[2:56:51] <$Solid_Stro> I appreciate you doing this so that I can simply copy your strategy later. sabert14Box
[2:56:51] <+CelioHogane> THIS was the one you missed last time
[2:56:53] <tacotaskforce> gearbox is melting down?
[2:56:57] <%GalacticaPhanto> @cohnjena13 you damn right he does
[2:56:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ComfortableStranger you most likely don't
[2:56:59] <+MelodyMedley> Oh boy Pat's still going through this huh
[2:57:09] <+CelioHogane> PERFECT
[2:57:11] <+BGDoombringer> the one you ran past before the 2 blocking the path is the one you missed earlier
[2:57:13] <%DianaTheAscian> what about gearbox?
[2:57:14] <+BGDoombringer> so you should be good now
[2:57:20] <$apolitenoob> @MelodyMedley To be fair he's almost got it
[2:57:21] <%BarujaraciGaming> you're good from here
[2:57:26] <%ComfortableStranger> @doc_ock_rokc wait what?
[2:57:34] <blackjack8182> Gearbox?
[2:57:53] <%asgard147> I know this is kinda unrelated, but I'm about to do the Dun Scaith raid in FF14 for the first time, anything perticular I need to be wary of? limesThink
[2:57:57] <+MelodyMedley> @MelodyMedley That's good to hear. This seems real tough
[2:57:59] <i_chevalier> @comfortablestranger he means that you know of
[2:58:17] <cohnjena13> This is live box abuse...I'm calling the box police, Pat

[3:11:55] <+CelioHogane> @AutechreTwinAphex No, Cid's a Dragoon, Sonon just uses a staff-mace
[3:11:55] <Felto3> not yet, you need a weapon upgrade for sync limit

[3:14:30] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @Dakuu75 was saying that because from that cutscene she seemed to not understand it was just a hologram
[3:14:39] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Yeahh Naga
[3:14:41] <%DedlokPM> @megadblitz jpop guy with a lot of money that uses that money to fund things he likes so he can get roles in them

[3:15:12] <tlimondaman> @PatStaresAt Have you seen the news of the Mario + Rabbids sequel, Sparks of Hope?
[3:15:19] <Profmcstevie> Oh god the shielding eyeballs
[3:15:19] <Basch71> this is just turn 7
[3:15:26] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> oh fuck these things
[3:15:35] <%ape_hawk> @ape_hawk thats what i mean. these are supposed to be for shinra dudes
[3:16:05] <+AutechreTwinAphex> you can actually use the block as a parry with Yuffie
[3:16:08] <%ComfortableStranger> its FUNlocking
[3:16:18] <+CelioHogane> Okay who in Shinra actually does this training, because i don't think there is any soldier that can actually fight this XD
[3:16:22] <i_chevalier> make sense yuffie is a speedster
[3:16:25] <%Valdorick> Stunlocking is bad in base game too, if you don't change party members when you start getting focused... but you can't party switch here... so...
[3:16:28] <%ComfortableStranger> shit's stunlocked!
[3:16:38] <+michingmallecho> Rufus does this fun… LUL

[3:17:15] <%TheHappyCynic> RAY CHASE!!!
[3:17:19] <i_chevalier> @celiohogane I think it more like preparations for new bio upgrades solider
[3:17:23] <DSD24> I like this music
[3:17:30] <%Valdorick> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends No, but I can hope.
[3:17:38] <+CelioHogane> Okay they do actually look like Daleks with legs.
[3:17:42] <+AutechreTwinAphex> were these in the base game?
[3:17:49] <majindusto> EXTERMINATE!!!!
[3:18:03] <%athuramn> I don't thinknso @autechretwinaphex
[3:18:13] <%Valdorick> They're on the path up to Shrina Tower,
[3:18:22] <%Valdorick> On the Sector 7 debris.
[3:18:23] <%Movemeister> they were

[3:19:03] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @athuramn ah thanks anyway
[3:19:22] <i_chevalier> @comfortablestranger that would be the day
[3:19:33] <+BGDoombringer> imagine infiltrating a place only to accidently help them with weapons testing and development
[3:19:39] <%athuramn> @comfortablestranger I want that to happen with baba is you
[3:19:55] <+Frranky> The secret to getting Sonon ATB is the ninja cannonball material
[3:20:01] <jmft2000> Is it just me or does the  music sound a little low or not quite right?
[3:20:01] <+Frranky> materia
[3:20:26] <ChungusQuest> Is that the first boss from Terraria?
[3:20:28] <+Frranky> it
[3:20:46] <%Monkeyweed21> Brumal Form gives tons of ATB
[3:20:47] <JakxTheStampede> Also ATB builds slower when Synchronized
[3:20:52] <+fetrigon> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:20:53] <Profmcstevie> Pets mimic their owners :)
[3:20:53] <DSD24> Did Yuffie always have that one stocking?

[3:21:54] <+BGDoombringer> ah yes, the long boy
[3:22:00] <%Daxalog> HOLD THE LINE
[3:22:06] <+CelioHogane> Why is it called a MOTH, it looks nothing like a moth
[3:22:08] <%AzureGale> Look at all these life-size Fort Condor pieces

[3:22:12] <i_chevalier> @ape_hawk it's a dlc
[3:22:18] <majindusto> HOLD THE LIIIIIIIINE
[3:22:35] <+CelioHogane> If anything it looks more like a Mantis
[3:22:46] <+myghtymatt> Although it’s padding, I look forward to the battles the most. This battle system is crack
[3:22:51] <%AzureGale> M.O.T.H.: Mega Obstinate Thing... Ham
[3:22:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Wow, I can't believe they made robots based on Fort Condor pieces :)
[3:22:58] <cohnjena13> Must Obtain Thicc Hooters UNIT
[3:23:09] <semachie> counterstance cant help you here
[3:23:19] <%AzureGale> DED
[3:23:20] <+Frranky> It only gets stagger if you hit it after its big super attack thing MOTH units suck
[3:23:23] <pilllowofbees> god i dont know whats better, how absurd thses robot resigns are or the fact the R&D made them work LUL
[3:23:26] <+CelioHogane> Must Obtain The Hunt
[3:23:36] <T_Sasquatch> what difficult is he on LUL
[3:23:50] <%AzureGale> Is Yuffie eating the potions
[3:23:52] <+CelioHogane> @pilllowofbees To be fair, it does look like the stupid shit R&D would make IRL
[3:24:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> You killed Scrapbeak
[3:24:12] <tacotaskforce> Sonon's just haveing a 4 energy drink day. I've been there.
[3:24:14] <+Frranky> stronger potions just makes me think of the potion seller
[3:24:17] <%DedlokPM> rescGiggle If only there was a bench.
[3:24:24] <+shaidot> can't you buy mega-potions?
[3:24:35] <%AzureGale> @pilllowofbees This is what happens when you don't tell the client no
[3:24:36] <cohnjena13> Bruh, Shinra R&D must be on all the drugs to come up with this shit
[3:24:41] <majindusto> You now face...THE SONIC THE HEDGEHOG BOT
[3:24:44] <+ratreborn> the ending is worth the padding
[3:24:53] <%Monkeyweed21> METAL SONIC
[3:24:57] <+Frranky> vulnerable rear
[3:24:58] <%AzureGale> Mmm, hard-boiled eggs are super rad
[3:25:02] <%Pappajimbo> EGG!!!!!!
[3:25:03] <+senfood> Would you like an egg in these trying times?
[3:25:08] <%AzureGale> They are fantastic with a little salt and pepper
[3:25:10] <%Xelhesia> rolling around at the speed of sound
[3:25:14] <%heartlesshealer> egg
[3:25:15] <%Robot_Nixon_> 👉 🥚
[3:25:17] <+fetrigon> I'll take one to KomodoHype
[3:25:17] <%DedlokPM> Pat would love a Hard-Boiled Eggman.
[3:25:21] <+CelioHogane> @ratreborn I really don't see any padding here, it was a lot of battles in a row, but that was the gimmick of this zone.
[3:25:26] <+AutechreTwinAphex> this enemy wasn't in Remake base game right?
[3:25:30] <%AzureGale> Got places to go, gotta follow my rainbow
[3:25:35] <+Frranky> he's just doing sick donuts
[3:25:38] <+Frranky> yeah this guy's new
[3:25:42] <majindusto> YOU'RE  TOO SLOW
[3:25:54] <+ratreborn> i didnt think it was padding either, but lots of people here are saying it is
[3:26:05] <+BGDoombringer> you want to battle and he simply wants to drift
[3:26:06] <%athuramn> could you imagine this thing actually being used in war. it's just doing wheelies down streets with missiles coming out from behind
[3:26:07] <+PlatinumRevol> Will Pat ever lock on?
[3:26:33] <%AzureGale> Give the robot a gutter, it'll become a master drifter
[3:26:46] <+fetrigon> chill yuffie
[3:26:46] <%AzureGale> I bet Scarlet is like 23 or something
[3:26:48] <pilllowofbees> @athuramn war never changes LUL

[3:27:21] <majindusto> I think Scarlet  is in her 30's
[3:27:27] <DSD24> This music sounds like Gran Turismo music
[3:27:29] <+ratreborn> idc how old she is, she can get it, 1 hunnid
[3:27:29] <+CelioHogane> You know what would be funny, if the final boss of the DLC is Sephiroth again for some fucking reason.
[3:27:34] <%ComfortableStranger> that's a lot of plastic surgery
[3:27:35] <%heartlesshealer> I guess makeup does a lot
[3:27:35] <Broken_Sonex> Yep, she’s 49
[3:27:38] <%Ipsenscastle> Scarlett sounds too much like Team Rocket Jessie to me
[3:27:51] <%DianaTheAscian> I always thought she was late 30s
[3:27:56] <Broken_Sonex> 40 I mean, I hate my phone

[3:45:31] <majindusto> I LOVE THEIR STUPID  TRON SUITS
[3:45:32] <Ner234> Deepground is from Dirge of Cerberus. Vincent;s game
[3:45:33] <%ConLin_Arts_> they even mentioned it earlier, did you miss it?
[3:45:34] <vance168> is that the Gackt signal high in the sky?
[3:45:35] <%heartlesshealer> Deepground SOLDIER
[3:45:35] <mr_saturday93> Clemps is freaking out rn

[3:45:45] <Zap_Rowsdower32> @logoth_  More like EU shit
[3:45:46] <%TimetodiveLTX> bet the PC version will mod in naruto music
[3:45:46] <+Missinglink91> How does Nomura have a job rn, like for real?
[3:45:48] <majindusto> DIRGE MUSIC  REMIX
[3:45:49] <+michingmallecho> kitase:"oh Nomura wants to include deep ground? Stick in the basement"
[3:45:49] <Profmcstevie> Dirge of Cerberus did such horrible things to the lore and world of FF7
[3:45:53] <+RaveBV> HAVE YOU HEARD OF LOVELESS???
[3:45:53] <%Ipsenscastle> I'm so mad that they're including this stuff, there's no way they can possibly make it cool
[3:45:53] <jorniev> I hate you dirge of cerberus
[3:45:53] <%heartlesshealer> wow, getting magic combo'd
[3:45:55] <+AutechreTwinAphex> Clemps has a PS5 yet?
[3:45:57] <%AzureGale> Is this like someone's FFVII fanfic in video game form
[3:45:59] <%YakumoYomi> Redeeeeemption!
[3:46:03] <+Qsmash_> are they teleporting in?
[3:46:06] <SailingSaturn> Stop blaming Normura cirBaka
[3:46:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Dread it, run from it, Gackt arrives all the same
[3:46:13] <+shaidot> this battle music is great
[3:46:15] <%heartlesshealer> banora white apples
[3:46:15] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> @Missinglink91 cause all the good people left
[3:46:15] <%logoth_> Only square would consistently reference an awful game
[3:46:17] <+UKOrigin> some of you guys hate boners are so cringey
[3:46:17] <%Ipsenscastle> @AzureGale it is exactly that
[3:46:17] <mr_saturday93> I don't understand why ppl are hating this
[3:46:21] <majindusto> I love you Dirge of Cerberus
[3:46:23] <+RaveBV> The sad part is that you'd only need to remove the whole loveless BS from Genesis to make him good, but that's his whole character.
[3:46:24] <+Missinglink91> I'll blame Nomura untill they take this garbage out
[3:46:25] <%AzureGale> WOMBO COMBO

[3:46:34] <+buffn99> @Missinglink91 what does that even mean
[3:46:35] <%FreeFuzeIcedTea> @AzureGale The writing team for Remake is almost entirely the original staff
[3:46:35] <mass1997> This is raw
[3:46:37] <+red_cuppa> i love that animation. you can see them do it to sonon too
[3:46:37] <%logoth_> Nomura apparently wanted to keep things SANE
[3:46:37] <+Freaknick1> YEAAAAAAH
[3:46:39] <%Monkeyweed21> WHY IS DEEPGROUND BEING COOL
[3:46:48] <+ratreborn> people blindly hate the Compilation stuff, some of it is good, some of it isnt that great
[3:46:50] <+Qsmash_> this is the best use of all the Deepground stuff
[3:46:51] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> i like how dirge is the deal breaker but plot ghosts, time travel and death being pointless are cool
[3:46:53] <SailingSaturn> @mr_saturday93 dirge was a bad game and the story was poor, so its a kneejerk reaction.
[3:46:53] <+CelioHogane> Wait, Cloud's was HUMANE experimentation?
[3:46:54] <+RaveBV> @FreeFuzeIcedTea except Nomura is the director, right?
[3:46:59] <+Missinglink91> All the deepground stuff, Weiss and Nero are awful characters from an awful game with an awful story
[3:46:59] <+shaidot> In fairness, Dirge of Cerberus was terrible. But, I don't think references here are bad at all
[3:47:00] <mr_saturday93> How dare they have the chance to fix the story of DOC?
[3:47:00] <pilllowofbees> @mr_saturday93 because of dirge of cerberus ptsd
[3:47:00] <fantaam1> so eh... is this music remixed or are you trying to not get dmca'd? because honestly it sounds kinda weird
[3:47:01] <majindusto> People  still blaming  Nomura enigmaKEK
[3:47:04] <+UKOrigin> the dirge stuff in this rocks
[3:47:06] <%logoth_> People dont "blindly" hate compilation stuff, its awful
[3:47:07] <+RaveBV> OG director got moved to Nomura's assistant and Nomura became the director.
[3:47:07] <GManx0> Wasnt Nomura the one holding back stuff to be more classic
[3:47:09] <balthazar758> neon gang
[3:47:13] <vance168> i think its pretty cool that they are taking stuff that didnt work and touching it up and refining it to be cool
[3:47:14] <+RaveBV> So expect shenanigans
[3:47:27] <+tigerfang86> GODDAMN IT YUFFIE
[3:47:29] <SailingSaturn> @RaveBV not for Part 2 and he isn't making decisions in a vacuum by himself
[3:47:29] <+michingmallecho> I'll be honest, I never played FF7 in the 90s, I wasn't even big into RPGs, and my first taste of anything FF7 was from Advent Children and even then that was because the visuals looked awesome and I still didn't touch Dirge LUL
[3:47:31] <%Xelhesia> LOL
[3:47:32] <Teyaric> Yeah, Cloud WAS the more humane stuff. Deepground is all gene-modded and crazy-mutant. hojo's party town, iirc
[3:47:32] <%athuramn> there's no way she's giving up guys, we're good
[3:47:32] <%FreeFuzeIcedTea> @RaveBV Not beyond Part 1, and he also was not on the writing team. A game Director doesn't make every single decision.
[3:47:34] <+UKOrigin> lmao
[3:47:35] <+buffn99> @Missinglink91 but its in this game and this game is good so its good
[3:47:35] <feralspidey> all that inhumane experimentation really wasn't worth it for all that stormtrooper aim...
[3:47:36] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> it's nomura's fault for not saying not saying no tot he dumb shit
[3:47:37] <+shaidot> it's intertwined in the universe of FF7 anyway
[3:47:37] <+BIumen> oh man theyre like, smart
[3:47:38] <SaltyAzteca> AANIMEEEE
[3:47:40] <%BarujaraciGaming> @missinglink91 well, that's.... just, like, you're opinion man
[3:47:41] <+fetrigon> LUL
[3:47:44] <Valkryna> wow bullets are useless
[3:47:44] <%sjay662> You cant make Nero cool
[3:47:46] <%cvp5127> bye leg
[3:47:48] <+CelioHogane> Did she just fucking rocket jump?
[3:47:53] <%TimetodiveLTX> i can't believe uffie is fucking ded
[3:47:55] <majindusto> NOMURA WAS ACTIVELY  TRYING TO HOLD BACK CHANGES
[3:47:57] <$RealThiele> deep
[3:47:58] <luciluxlu0> never understood how they aren't getting shot.
[3:48:01] <+RaveBV> @SailingSaturn Oh yeah, I entirely forgot about Nomura not being the part 2 lead. Maybe that's why the Deep Ground (dirge) stuff is more tasteful in the DLC?>
[3:48:01] <+Missinglink91> The Dude does NOT abide
[3:48:03] <Chaos_Aether> OH NO
[3:48:04] <%Daxalog> Did she just rocket jump?
[3:48:05] <%AzureGale> Chapter 3?
[3:48:19] <%kewlmyc> Anime and stormtrooper aim
[3:48:20] <@SoFarFetched> ninja clan with the ninja plan geefSmart
[3:48:23] <mr_saturday93> plus plot armor
[3:48:24] <JesusFromSpace> ninjas are immune to bullets
[3:48:24] <acridpaladin> they were holding the block button didnt you see?
[3:48:24] <%FreeFuzeIcedTea> FFVII Compilation hateboners are so exhausting, either accept FFVII as a big dumb anime or just shut up at this point
[3:48:28] <%za7az> Ninjutsu :)
[3:48:29] <$RealThiele> long as they keep moving bullets have minimal effect
[3:48:30] <pilllowofbees> just push block the bullet 4Head
[3:48:32] <%DianaTheAscian> the plot needs them to not get shot
[3:48:33] <+ratreborn> its still chapter 2
[3:48:35] <%Tearonex> have you ever heard of a ninja being shot? I rest my case
[3:48:35] <+RaveBV> Glad he isn't doing part 2 and onward. Nomura loves that goofy Loveless and Dirge slop.
[3:48:40] <%heartlesshealer> in-game lore Ninjas are extremely hard to shoot acurrately
[3:48:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Canonically, Wutai Ninjas can avoid bullets, some NPCs earlier in the game mention it
[3:48:42] <Zap_Rowsdower32> They're like Nathan Drake and are immune to bullets so long as their luck doesn't run our.
[3:48:46] <%logoth_> @FreeFuzeIcedTea No.
[3:48:46] <+PlatinumRevol> Nomura apparently stopped this from being way worse. Nojima is the one with the crazy ideas
[3:48:46] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> ITS CALLED FINAL FANTASY. Seriously?
[3:48:47] <jorniev> yuffie and sonon are incredibly capable
[3:48:47] <mr_saturday93> this is still the 2ns chapter
[3:48:48] <Chaos_Aether> Time to fight the Bros
[3:48:50] <+Missinglink91> FF7 can be a big dumb anime, but the stuff they added AFTER the OG game is even MORE big dumb anime imo
[3:48:50] <%athuramn> "3-4 hours"
[3:48:53] <SpellCatty> DOOR STUCK
[3:48:55] <balthazar758> antibullets nojutsu

[3:49:02] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Jebaited
[3:49:04] <%LouieRouie> Ninjas can't be shot. This has been established
[3:49:04] <+michingmallecho> Nomura wasn't the only director on FF7make. There's two other guys and the writer is Nojima.
[3:49:07] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> @Freaknick1 ff7 was good dumb anime the compilation and reboot are not
[3:49:07] <Jrocy247> WOW
[3:49:07] <%ComfortableStranger> shits locked!
[3:49:10] <%whyskeywolfe> UGH.
[3:49:10] <+shaidot> people hate on nomura for no reason

[3:49:59] <+Frranky> Gackt is not in this game
[3:50:00] <+doug_famous> Queen of blades!\
[3:50:00] <+AutechreTwinAphex> I basically just see it as a cool Metal Gear Psycho Mantis-esque boss, nothing more than that
[3:50:01] <%Eaglestrike117> this is dirge
[3:50:02] <$apolitenoob> Is he new? Or is he gackt?
[3:50:03] <semachie> @megadblitz nope
[3:50:04] <%TimetodiveLTX> this knocks off half a star
[3:50:05] <+RaveBV> He has become metal gear
[3:50:05] <%ConLin_Arts_> Gackt is in Crisis Core
[3:50:06] <%kewlmyc> It's not Gackt, but it is someone equally as stupid
[3:50:06] <mr_saturday93> The darkness sora!
[3:50:07] <%DianaTheAscian> did he just fart?
[3:50:07] <%ComfortableStranger> whats with the GIMP suit?
[3:50:12] <+UKOrigin> this chat is gross
[3:50:13] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Nothing personnel, kid
[3:50:14] <+senfood> DONUT THE STEEL
[3:50:15] <%HairballCT> are we SURE this guy didn't get norted
[3:50:16] <%LouieRouie> hurt me more snake
[3:50:23] <+NiktenKing> I wouldnt mind Rosso cause her backstory at least makes sense
[3:50:25] <%ape_hawk> "SCARLET, TURN OFF MY PAIN INHIBITORS!"
[3:50:30] <%Valdorick> He's *a* Gackt, but not THE Gackt
[3:50:30] <+Missinglink91> It makes me worried how they're going to try and work Nero and Weiss into the overall game/story
[3:50:30] <%Daxalog> I havent played any final fantasy stuff this feels a little weird now. Is this how the normal game went?
[3:50:31] <%StormBuster24> yo alright
[3:50:34] <SaltyAzteca> WACKT
[3:50:38] <%BarujaraciGaming> @missinglink91 you don't even know what you're talking about lol. the dude definitely abides, and would not stand for this.... for this..... uh......
[3:50:38] <%ConLin_Arts_> this is from Dirge of Cerberus, Gackt was only in the very end of it to tie it to Crisis Core
[3:50:48] <+Frranky> @Daxalog Nothing in this DLC is from the original game
[3:50:50] <Uselesswhitenoise> @Daxalog no this is all fanfic
[3:50:51] <+Calek> @Daxalog this is post FF7 stuff from Dirge of Cerberus
[3:51:00] <KitsuneManami> Nice  Cid animations
[3:51:00] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> @Daxalog this is all stuff from post og ff7 it's all awful
[3:51:00] <+buffn99> @Daxalog final fantasy games are always weird
[3:51:01] <$RealThiele> yea the gackt thing is highly overblown for laughs
[3:51:03] <%TimetodiveLTX> max payne
[3:51:12] <+NickNackProductions> catjam
[3:51:12] <%Maids4lyfe> none of it is fanfic it's all canon
[3:51:13] <+RaveBV> @Daxalog No, this entire DLC is new content. What's even more different is that that blade char you just saw is from a spin-off game, so it's even weirder. He's not supposed to appear yet.
[3:51:14] <%ConLin_Arts_> Gackt is Genesis
[3:51:16] <Zap_Rowsdower32> FF7 Remake is canonically a sequel to original FF7
[3:51:21] <+michingmallecho> I remember when Vincent saved the planet with the power of friendship... hasL Silverhand Jebaited
[3:51:21] <%megadblitz> @kewlmyc could i classify it as "a gackt" if its stupid enough? idk anything not even what gackt is
[3:51:27] <%AzureGale> WOMBO COMBO
[3:51:30] <%heartlesshealer> gimp guy is Nero the Sable from Dirge of Cerberus if anyone needed to know
[3:51:36] <%logoth_> Genesis had a prominent role in crisis core so no... its not blown out of proportion
[3:51:38] <+Zanzibar_Junker> This all leading to Zack and Cloud murdering Sephiroth together.
[3:51:42] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> @Zap_Rowsdower32 says who? it's reboot
[3:51:45] <+Frranky> PAIN SENSATION MAX
[3:51:49] <%FreeFuzeIcedTea> The amount of people calling this fanfic when not only is it canon, it's mostly the original writers as well psaWhat
[3:51:52] <$RealThiele> Zack and cloud sync attacks yeahhh
[3:51:53] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> or rebuild
[3:51:53] <%Daxalog> ah gotcha
[3:51:56] <%alloVera> kzxG
[3:52:07] <%stickislaw> One might say it's set to "Max Payne".
[3:52:10] <+RaveBV> Remember when Genesis appeared at the end of Dirge and did absolutely nothing after that cliffhanger?
[3:52:11] <+Missinglink91> It can be the original writers, that doesnt mean I have to like it
[3:52:16] <%logoth_> @FreeFuzeIcedTea Nobody means its LITERALLY fanfiction, they're insulting how dumb it is
[3:52:19] <+Frranky> @FreeFuzeIcedTea fanfic just means "thing I don't like"
[3:52:22] <+michingmallecho> Cloud and Zack are going to finish Sephiroth off like how Goku/Frieza both beat Jiren. LUL
[3:52:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> From what I understand, I think Weiss mostly just appears in this as a VR bonus boss, Nero's the one who is the big menace in the DLC. I could be wrong though
[3:52:23] <%ComfortableStranger> zach enabled cloud synch?
[3:52:25] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Yeah a lot of this is Kitase not Nomura
[3:52:25] <+Frranky> apparently
[3:52:31] <majindusto> Compilation  was always  gonna be canon...Anyone  trying  to deny  it is a Deluded Moron
[3:52:31] <%ConLin_Arts_> it is a Sequel, the subtitle does not say the game is a remake, but that the story is about remake
[3:52:36] <ARDM112> I guess we all love prequels now, they were made by Lucas after all
[3:52:37] <Wobuzhidao> No one is forcing y'all to watch
[3:52:39] <%LaughingCatt> oh fuck its Cthulu
[3:52:40] <+buffn99> @logoth_ what's dumb about what happened so far?
[3:52:42] <+AutechreTwinAphex> Bloodborne
[3:52:43] <vance168> yoooooo
[3:52:47] <+tigerfang86> DIABOLIC RECREATION
[3:52:49] <+UKOrigin> yall need to get a grip
[3:52:49] <+ratreborn> @logoth_ The stuff in Crisis Core makes less sense than the stuff in Dirge of Cerberus, yet I like Crisis Core more.
[3:52:50] <vance168> dude thats sick
[3:52:50] <CTMathiu> eldritch, heck yeah
[3:52:51] <%Valdorick> Mind Flayer.
[3:52:51] <+shaidot> the writers should have done a better when they were working on the original FF7 compilation, but I'm actually fine with these characters being in the remake
[3:52:52] <%AzureGale> What is this Diablo enemy
[3:52:52] <%ape_hawk> this is just like one of my japanese hentais!
[3:52:53] <+MelodyMedley> Woah
[3:52:56] <%heartlesshealer> a diabolic creation
[3:52:57] <mr_saturday93> Cthulhu!
[3:52:57] <+Missinglink91> Say what you will but I have no qualms complaining that they added post FF7 junk into what I was hoping was a remake of FF7, Like I'm still gonna continue playing/buying it but it makes me really skeptical
[3:52:57] <$RealThiele> seems accurate
[3:52:58] <%LaughingCatt> Cannibal Cthulu
[3:53:00] <+SaurianCrash> i see its pretty immune
[3:53:04] <%MugenSandan> Looks more like a Jenova
[3:53:06] <+Jeshk0> el Diablo?? Ay mios Dios!!
[3:53:06] <+NickNackProductions> is this made from jenova junk
[3:53:12] <%Dakuu75> Canabolism and disobediance. this guy is no joke
[3:53:15] <%Eaglestrike117> thats a jenova
[3:53:16] <+Frranky> SLAM
[3:53:16] <Grimdogx> Yeahhhhhhhh my time as a Dirge Of Cerberus apologist pays off!
[3:53:18] <+griffball13> Command grab
[3:53:18] <%heartlesshealer> it's an Almost-Diablo
[3:53:20] <+ghostfaceninja_> knockoff Jenova
[3:53:21] <+RaveBV> @FreeFuzeIcedTea It's canon but think of it this way: Part 1 would have been an entirely different game if Nomura wasn't the lead and got to put time shenanigans.
[3:53:22] <$RealThiele> GOTCHA BEETCH
[3:53:30] <GManx0> So how about this: Adding the Dirge characters...but maybe this time they actually can make them good
[3:53:31] <+Buzzkill983> Fanfic Yuffie fought a lot of crazy shit
[3:53:36] <i_need_sciss0rz> how long is this DLC playing casually?
[3:53:36] <%AzureGale> Can you target that projector thing
[3:53:46] <%ComfortableStranger> can you target the projector?
[3:53:49] <AllenDeadman> is... that Jenova's right arm?
[3:53:50] <+RaveBV> The plot for remake would have been less clusterfuck if not for Nomura and now that he stepped down, better writers have to make it work. lol
[3:53:51] <AllenDeadman> huh
[3:53:52] <blue8moon> Nomura didn't want all the changes, that was the other directors and writers
[3:53:52] <Brunty023> @i_need_sciss0rz Roughly 4hrs
[3:53:53] <+Frranky> @AzureGale can't touch the projector till you kill the monster
[3:53:58] <mr_saturday93> it's like 4 to 5 hours long
[3:54:01] <+Zanzibar_Junker> People complain about Gackt but Lucrecia is the worst.
[3:54:02] <+Calek> @RaveBV Nomura pushed for a proper remake, one of the other directors or whatever pushed for what we got
[3:54:05] <%ConLin_Arts_> the name Remake is in name only
[3:54:05] <%IamGrapes> IamGrapes subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! hello Pat, hope things are going well. I've only seen the trailer for Elden Ring. anything else come out of E3 worth looking into?
[3:54:06] <%AzureGale> @AzureGale Got it, thanks
[3:54:09] <pilllowofbees> @i_need_sciss0rz think like 7-8 hours
[3:54:09] <i_need_sciss0rz> ahh cool ty
[3:54:13] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> @RaveBV lol nojima is trash he's not a good writer
[3:54:15] <%MrBorisMakarov> can't damage projector until big Boi ded
[3:54:23] <+UKOrigin> @RaveBV youre talking out your ass
[3:54:23] <+buffn99> @ConLin_Arts_ what does that mean
[3:54:35] <$RealThiele> oh god its got a lot of HP
[3:54:35] <%ConLin_Arts_> it isn't a remake
[3:54:40] <%ConLin_Arts_> the name is called remake
[3:54:42] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Ramuh?.... now?.... really?
[3:54:42] <%FreeFuzeIcedTea> @RaveBV I don't agree at all. Again, he wasn't one of the writers, and it also seems like they have this entire thing incredibly thought out. Whether it'll work or not we have to wait and see, but throwing Nomura's name around at shit you don't like is just nonsense.
[3:54:47] <majindusto> Personally, i look forward  to more  Compilation  stuff returning and love seeing people  crying  like babies  about  it
[3:54:51] <%ConLin_Arts_> like RE2 isn't called RE2 remake
[3:54:58] <+Frranky> I remember this chat rage-shitting itself that pat liked the main game so I'm not surprised i's also whining about the DLC
[3:54:58] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Remake is still better than Attack on Titan
[3:55:04] <+buffn99> @ConLin_Arts_ In what way isn't it a remake?
[3:55:06] <majindusto> I ENJOY THIS SHIT
[3:55:08] <mr_saturday93> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends normura isn't responsible for everything in the writing...
[3:55:11] <+shaidot> bruh there is literally evidence in defense of Nomura everywhere outside Kingdom Hearts. No reason to blame him for every complaint
[3:55:13] <%ConLin_Arts_> the game has the subtitle Remake because that is the story
[3:55:13] <semachie> @freefuzeicedtea hard agree
[3:55:14] <%heartlesshealer> Ramuh attack the other thing
[3:55:19] <%ConLin_Arts_> it is about remaking
[3:55:20] <Tapperfa> @FreeFuzeIcedTea But you don't Understand Nomura is my boogeyman so I HAVE to blame him
[3:55:22] <+michingmallecho> Rebuild of Evangelion 3.0+1.0 came out...that's all I'm going to say. LUL
[3:55:25] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> It is a Remake....fully. This game is awesome
[3:55:30] <Brunty023> @majindusto Same! I was skeptical at first, but now they have me on this wild ride
[3:55:31] <@SoFarFetched> I can't believe we're having the "remake vs reboot" FF7R argument AGAIN after a whole year geefBruh
[3:55:35] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> it's kitase and nojima just look at ff8 that was pretty much all them
[3:55:41] <+AutechreTwinAphex> I never played Dirge or Crisis Core, only FF7 OG so I dunno what anyone is bitching about
[3:55:46] <$RealThiele> what is dead may never die
[3:55:54] <+buffn99> @ConLin_Arts_ it's a remake my friend
[3:55:56] <GManx0> I am more shocked people still sthink this is a straight remake after the finale
[3:55:57] <Srthunda> chat look, cool stuff is happening right on your screen!
[3:56:03] <%ConLin_Arts_> like if it was a remake remake it would just have been called Final Fantasy 7 like all other remakes that don't add remake to the title
[3:56:05] <%Ipsenscastle> @AutechreTwinAphex you made the correct decision
[3:56:06] <+shaidot> it's an alternate timeline deal
[3:56:11] <+ratreborn> @AutechreTwinAphex should probably get on Crisis Core at least
[3:56:13] <%VashyronM> @SoFarFetched Really? You can't believe people are still willing to fight about this?
[3:56:15] <mr_saturday93> Nomura being In anything and anyone with a dumb hate hi Dr will blame him for everything
[3:56:17] <SaphronBlackbourne> @SoFarFetched We're probably going to get it every time there's new 7R content tbh
[3:56:17] <+Frranky> @SoFarFetched time is a flat circle
[3:56:23] <@SoFarFetched> Im not surprised,just disappointed.
[3:56:31] <%Maids4lyfe> @buffn99 Zack lived for starters, Aerith knows the future and wants to prevent her death, Jesse Biggs and Wedge are all still alive. This is an alternate timeline and is effectively a sequel
[3:56:33] <pilllowofbees> @AutechreTwinAphex LUL just know that durge was supper out there
[3:56:38] <+michingmallecho> I hope a little chibi cloud with popeye arms shows up in part 2.
[3:56:39] <+Frranky> gg
[3:56:42] <+skeletonmilk> BIG NUMBER
[3:56:42] <JesusFromSpace> close
[3:56:43] <KitsuneManami> BRIGHT
[3:56:46] <+KawaiiJetty> yeye
[3:56:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Honestly, I think the stuff here and in the main game of FF7R has been fine, so I expect that future stuff will also be fine
[3:56:48] <+MelodyMedley> Nice
[3:56:51] <Grimdogx> I'm glad we didn't get 1 to 1 remake, as much as I love FF7 it's a story I experienced like 15 times.
[3:57:02] <%ConLin_Arts_> @buffn99 like it is a sequel, it remakes the story sure but it is not the same story, it is remaking it.
[3:57:06] <%Maximilian_DOOD> YUP @Valentinius_Anodyne
[3:57:11] <+shaidot> @Grimdogx that's what I'm saying
[3:57:12] <+ratreborn> @Grimdogx this
[3:57:14] <@SoFarFetched> oh hey Max
[3:57:18] <%LaughingCatt> she IS postgame dlc
[3:57:21] <+michingmallecho> Max... KomodoHype
[3:57:21] <+GingerStrawhat> Hehe You say that now
[3:57:23] <+MelodyMedley> Oh Max is here
[3:57:25] <+Frranky> yeah it's hard only having two characters and a limited materia selection
[3:57:25] <%IamGrapes> ohai Max
[3:57:26] <%nevan_44> max PogChamp
[3:57:27] <KitsuneManami> @Maximilian_DOOD  liked your parts in Matt's video
[3:57:27] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> why do people keep saying it's a sequel?
[3:57:27] <+GingerStrawhat> Just Wait for it Pat
[3:57:28] <Sol_Install> yo max
[3:57:29] <Chaos_Aether> yuu is max
[3:57:29] <Profmcstevie> doodStare
[3:57:29] <mr_saturday93> @grimdogx and the fact most of the story beats don't make much sense that the remake makes better
[3:57:30] <%FreeFuzeIcedTea> I think they're handling Compilation material incredibly well. It's there, it exists, but it's not the focus.
[3:57:31] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Barret is so much cooler in Remake
[3:57:33] <SaphronBlackbourne> I'm willing to give 7R's story a chance
[3:57:34] <%Maximilian_DOOD> Stupid compilation stuff aside, they way they handle the stuff in the Remake is fine if not really good
[3:57:34] <%Xelhesia> DOOD has arrived
[3:57:35] <+buffn99> @Maids4lyfe Right but it's still a remake. It doesn't matter that things are different. The word doesn't need to mean it's exactly the same
[3:57:35] <%Daxalog> MAX DID it
[3:57:38] <+BallerSwagBro9k> MAX KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[3:57:39] <majindusto> Oh no, MAX HERE
[3:57:39] <+shaidot> Max here in time for Nero lmao
[3:57:40] <+ghostfaceninja_> hey Max doodBro doodBro doodBro
[3:57:40] <SaphronBlackbourne> It's goofy but like, so is a lot of FF
[3:57:41] <+MightyDuckShoes> I dont know. I remember the core of the hate of the spin offs was that they were half baked games. Crisis Core gets the least flak and it just happened to be a well made game. Dumb off the wall shit aside, this looks fun.
[3:57:41] <xBonYx> pat, mb go emote mode???
[3:57:41] <%heartlesshealer> think of the "Remake" part as the FF7 world after it was remade. Second iteration of world post-Holy/Meteor
[3:57:43] <+RowenCleric> yay Max
[3:57:49] <%AzureGale> It's quiet... too quiet
[3:57:52] <+griffball13> brother nero
[3:57:53] <T_Sasquatch> ninja dagger
[3:57:55] <MechanizedGentleman> Hey look it's that guy no one liked, from that game that was terrible!
[3:57:57] <%NocturneNovember> I hope the rest of Remake makes the Deepground nerds cool
[3:57:57] <DejaraUndead> he is dead weight
[3:57:59] <%Pappajimbo> cool dad max
[3:57:59] <SaphronBlackbourne> The characters and their interactions are great
[3:58:00] <+shaidot> oh hi xehanort
[3:58:05] <AllenDeadman> oh... right
[3:58:07] <%FreeFuzeIcedTea> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends Because it is one, it's a literal "Remake" of FF7's events due to post-AC Sephiroth meddling with time
[3:58:08] <%heartlesshealer> time for Sable
[3:58:09] <%ape_hawk> yuffie, youre fine, the plot ghosts will protect you... sonon, on the other hand...
[3:58:10] <shutaco> oh hi gakt
[3:58:14] <Kain5707> @Maximilian_DOOD i see you are here to watch the ending again doodGood
[3:58:15] <%ConLin_Arts_> Remakes don't usually put the name remake in the title
[3:58:17] <T_Sasquatch> that seems alot ...
[3:58:18] <%LaughingCatt> the Dark Goo
[3:58:20] <Zebroneath> what a big dumb loser
[3:58:21] <%AzureGale> Look at this Ninja Scroll shit
[3:58:22] <%whyskeywolfe> I just can't deal with how Nero and Weiss DRIP of fanfiction. Because that's what they are.
[3:58:23] <%heartlesshealer> Gackt isn't this one
[3:58:23] <+BIumen> well that is very much not gackt
[3:58:25] <+kepazhe> guys just think of it like the Eva Rebuilds
[3:58:26] <%Ipsenscastle> fuck it, drop Shelke in here as well, let's go full idiot mode
[3:58:27] <$RealThiele> exotic dancer goo
[3:58:27] <+UKOrigin> i think nero is rad
[3:58:29] <%Robot_Nixon_> dark evil WutFace
[3:58:31] <+Zanzibar_Junker> that's not Gackt
[3:58:31] <+doug_famous> And then the Protoss arrive
[3:58:32] <+Koldsned> Yeah this guy pushed my s*** in a few times
[3:58:33] <%KineticZen> Team Jockstrap on Face
[3:58:33] <+chaseyd> Honestly I think they're handling the FF7 Compilation content quite well. Not making it "super" important but not forgetting it either.
[3:58:33] <+senfood> They're so edgy and awful that they come full circle and become hilarious.
[3:58:34] <Deasmeister> So many belts
[3:58:35] <%za7az> Death Stranding? LUL
[3:58:35] <%cvp5127> LUL
[3:58:36] <Jrocy247> I can't fucking believe this is in the fucking story
[3:58:40] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Jesus
[3:58:40] <mr_saturday93> I like his power
[3:58:42] <+michingmallecho> The coolest guy
[3:58:42] <%Valdorick> Metal... GEAR!?
[3:58:43] <+Frranky> "cool"
[3:58:44] <MechanizedGentleman> Just straight up magic superpower bullshit in a game where everyone else has to use materia.
[3:58:46] <+SilverDevilfish> So Deadweight and Book walk into the plot Kappa
[3:58:47] <+chaseyd> Gives me faith that the rest of the Remake will be just as incredible as the original in its own way.
[3:58:48] <%Ne1son> Oh Brother Nero I knew you'd come
[3:58:49] <%Robot_Nixon_> its the edge gas power
[3:58:50] <%heartlesshealer> Gackt is Crisis Core, this is Dirge
[3:58:50] <+ghostfaceninja_> what is Nomura's deal with "darkness tentacles?"
[3:58:51] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> @FreeFuzeIcedTea yes ff7 needed time travel cayse why?
[3:58:52] <%megadblitz> what the fuck is this uy
[3:58:54] <+skeletonmilk> Bro i fucking hate JRPG dialogue
[3:58:57] <+Xeno351> he looks like a gimp
[3:58:58] <monopolyman001> this is too scary monkaS
[3:59:02] <%bassoontyphoon> Psycho mantis???
[3:59:02] <majindusto> THIS SHIT IS GREAT
[3:59:05] <jorniev> IS THAT THE CRISIS CORE? OR THE DIRGE OF CERBERUS?
[3:59:09] <+Calek> he was kind of a pushover
[3:59:12] <acridpaladin> lul he cant read
[3:59:13] <%KineticZen> Black the Black
[3:59:14] <pilllowofbees> oh no he cant real LUL
[3:59:14] <%ConLin_Arts_> Dirge
[3:59:15] <+Frranky> I love the music in this fight
[3:59:15] <$RealThiele> this is some 14yr olds naruto OC
[3:59:15] <KrentistTheDentist> jockstrap man
[3:59:16] <%heartlesshealer> let the games begin, thanks for reference
[3:59:16] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Shinra let out their gimp out of the basement
[3:59:16] <+michingmallecho> Oh the music
[3:59:18] <%Maximilian_DOOD> I kinda dig how they turn Deepground into Shinra Freakshow in VIIR
[3:59:18] <Sporkgasm> wow you really have to fight an illiterate guy
[3:59:18] <%kewlmyc> Looks like dead weight to me
[3:59:20] <%Ipsenscastle> Rip him up, Yuffie
[3:59:20] <+Buzzkill983> Are we going to get Shelke too!?
[3:59:21] <%FreeFuzeIcedTea> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends The literal first FF game is about a timeloop, so why not
[3:59:22] <+AutechreTwinAphex> he's basically a Metal Gear boss - Crying Mantis / Psycho Mantis
[3:59:22] <feralspidey> straight up a kingdom hearts villain
[3:59:28] <+myghtymatt> I love the metal gear vibes, it just fits with ff7
[3:59:30] <mass1997> A lot of cope going on in chat...
[3:59:30] <%nevan_44> dont get his dark juice on you monkaS
[3:59:32] <%Jekado> I was expecting instant death from that
[3:59:33] <majindusto> DIRGE BATTLE WOOOO
[3:59:39] <%heartlesshealer> Dirge. Weiss is both Dirge and CC, but Nero is pure Dirge
[3:59:41] <%LaughingCatt> so uh, despite people making fun of him.. he aint no joke here
[3:59:45] <+GingerStrawhat> Just wait for it
[3:59:49] <KitsuneManami> Nah
[3:59:49] <StarlitStunner> YEYEEYEYE!
[3:59:50] <%KineticZen> Yeah, bully this nerd
[3:59:50] <MechanizedGentleman> Fuggin Nomura "you know what would make this game even better? my shitty edgelord OC from DoC"
[3:59:51] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> @FreeFuzeIcedTea cause ff7 was never about time travel, that game was
[3:59:51] <+Kaask> synergy is so strong
[3:59:52] <%AzureGale> Are you supposed to be able to win this battle
[3:59:53] <MayShip> you can just tell his design comes from one of Nomura's phases after OG 7
[3:59:57] <%KineticZen> Maybe we can make Dirge not happen
[3:59:59] <majindusto> Have fun pat
[4:00:00] <mr_saturday93> yeah he's a tough boss
[4:00:01] <KitsuneManami> hes big joke when ur not BAD
[4:00:04] <+RowenCleric> I feel like Id like deepground more if their names were literally not Color the Color, Black the Black or White the white
[4:00:08] <%Deft_Thought> Man, his hair is really stupid
[4:00:08] <acridpaladin> i mean, hes still a joke. giving him a big healthbar doesnt change that
[4:00:09] <+MelodyMedley> There we go
[4:00:11] <+Rolandknight> well vincent is the one that kills him
[4:00:13] <pilllowofbees> hes loves getting his ass beat LUL
[4:00:14] <jorniev> SOOO LAME
[4:00:15] <+Frranky> I love that the containment protocol is just casting Stop on him
[4:00:17] <+Jeshk0> ruh roh
[4:00:17] <%FreeFuzeIcedTea> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends You can do weird new things with existing material, yknow
[4:00:20] <+RocketBarrel> In Dirge wasn't Deepground like Shinra Secret Service? or am I wrong?
[4:00:21] <AllenDeadman> run like a chocobo, stab like a tonberry
[4:00:21] <KitsuneManami> Arena Change
[4:00:21] <%AzureGale> GET REKT
[4:00:23] <%Xelhesia> well then
[4:00:25] <%heartlesshealer> Yuffie...
[4:00:26] <+PlatinumRevol> Lot of coping here
[4:00:28] <%ConLin_Arts_> monkaS
[4:00:28] <+griffball13> tribal tats
[4:00:28] <%KineticZen> Mff mff mff mffffff
[4:00:28] <%Deft_Thought> Of course he has tribal tattoos
[4:00:29] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Damn
[4:00:33] <+ratreborn> Shimomura just kicked in
[4:00:34] <%heartlesshealer> ARMS HOLY SHIT
[4:00:34] <jorniev> THE EDGE LEVELS ARE GOING CRITICAL

[4:00:40] <Ultimatefool> Holy shit this guy is like PEAK Nomura
[4:00:41] <%Extrallent> I just want him to take off that stupid mask

[4:07:59] <@SoFarFetched> this music though
[4:08:00] <+AutechreTwinAphex> a scene by scene remake is boring and dies quickly - just look at demons' souls PS5 as an example of that
[4:08:06] <majindusto> THE MUSIC enigmaGasm
[4:08:06] <brainflint> I'd rather go back to the train ghost fight
[4:08:13] <tacotaskforce> So we should be able to kill him put using a phoenix down on him, right?
[4:08:14] <%WutangchickeN> DMC Nero is WAY better than this loser LUL

[4:11:16] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends I disagree, the original game has aged considerably and would only sell to a small part of the gaming audience today
[4:11:18] <+Chronobot> Cant skip this EDGE
[4:11:18] <%Ipsenscastle> ahnuld noises
[4:11:19] <SaltyAzteca> But you HAVE to watch this scene

[4:11:21] <+UKOrigin> it doesnt do much dps tho
[4:11:25] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> What is free is having high level items and NOT using them on a three phase boss

[4:11:41] <GodOfChocobos> man i hope they allow for skippable mid boss cutscenes
[4:11:43] <GManx0> So now that Deepground stuff is canon, Will Vincent actually have relevance to the plot?
[4:11:43] <+Kaask> hmmm
[4:11:44] <Profmcstevie> He's got the HP for it
[4:11:45] <%superc37> @AutechreTwinAphex the fuck are you talking about? no one was asking for a scene by scene remake, literally the game we got, minus the stupid plot ghosts, with a better use of seph wouldve been more then fine.
[4:11:46] <brainflint> I still cant look at this dudes face it's like a MHA villain that got denied for putting undies on his face
[4:11:48] <%GalacticaPhanto> Dude it's also great that Yuffie give Nero a run for his money and Vincent struggled
[4:11:50] <MechanizedGentleman> @TimetodiveLTX is anyone arguing with you on that point?
[4:11:52] <pilllowofbees> looks pretty finale bossy to me
[4:11:52] <%AzureGale> @TurtlesAndTentacles Yeah but what if there was a harder boss after this one

[4:12:08] <$RealThiele> his stats are fine just gotta use spells like regen and cura actively
[4:12:20] <Uselesswhitenoise> @TimetodiveLTX yeah, people keep trying to strawman people by pretending hateing nero means you hate the whole remake
[4:12:22] <pilllowofbees> @Missinglink91 is it also anime bullshit LUL
[4:12:25] <%Dakuu75> "Darkness is a heart's TRUE... essence."

[4:14:37] <%MugenSandan> Didn't Nojima and Kitase invent these characters?
[4:14:38] <Jrocy247> Nero is acting like he's the final boss but we ALL know he's not
[4:14:42] <+Missinglink91> He needs to learn how to not use items so he can beat it on hard mode

[4:15:11] <MayShip> i don't even remember what Nero did in his own game. i would believe anyone if they said these powers were just made up for this

[4:23:13] <%Mekhet09> You know, I would have been fine with a retelling but the time ghost subplot. Literally ruined the game for me. Like I didn't need a 1:1 but that bullshit just made it unpalpable. I have no faith in part 2.
[4:23:14] <+SilverDevilfish> He'll come back as Rouge the Red or some shit
[4:23:15] <solid2272> theory: he's gonna get turned into a hojo experiment

[4:30:46] <PartyFavors> Yep! Zack's IN THE SAME TIMELINE
[4:30:46] <TricksterJoseph> timelines merged
[4:30:46] <SchroedingersFerret> GUNGAGA
[4:30:47] <+xiccy> Don't that mean they miss Yuffie? You get her before you get to Kalm?
[4:30:47] <agadejobi> TIME GHOOOOOOOSSSSTTSSSSSSSSSS
[4:30:47] <jorniev> ALTERNATE TIMELINE
[4:30:48] <BrickleBork> aerith?
[4:30:48] <+tigerfang86> TIMELINE MERGE?????
[4:30:48] <%asgard147> SO CONFUSING limesS monkaS
[4:30:49] <%Dakuu75> all the ppl fromt he plate survived, right?
[4:30:49] <BanSenpai> MY FAVORITE ZACK!!!!
[4:30:49] <tattleworm> do you want the answer?
[4:30:49] <%TimetodiveLTX> because he's a moron
[4:30:49] <%mikesapartment> that bitch DED
[4:30:50] <tyrianfolly> EVERYONE IS DEAD
[4:30:50] <+fetrigon> waaaaaiiiiitttt
[4:30:51] <willsin4fun> flowers are dead
[4:30:52] <Sapphire_Breeze> WHAT THE FUCK
[4:30:52] <+michingmallecho> I'm so interested
[4:30:53] <%Piemono> This is getting confusing
[4:30:53] <+eanscrale> wait what
[4:30:53] <%AzureGale> HOL UP
[4:30:53] <+CookieCutter007> did Zack travel ?
[4:30:54] <%Jekado> WHAT THE WHAT
[4:30:54] <dr_sweets> Zack Time Travel!!!
[4:30:54] <%Torus1025> ZACH'S IN THE PARTY BOYS
[4:30:54] <jorniev> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[4:30:55] <%weissguard> fuuuuuuuuuuuck
[4:30:55] <%Tearonex> ZACK IS 100000% ALIVE FOR SURE
[4:30:55] <%spartanghost004> oh she dead
[4:30:56] <%GalacticaPhanto> oooof
[4:30:57] <%Valdorick> "I gotta NTR my main man Cloud"
[4:30:58] <+eanscrale> what??????
[4:30:58] <@SoFarFetched> YEAAHHH
[4:30:59] <Wolfstriker121> if this is a different time line........then shes dead in that house?!?!
[4:31:00] <Jrocy247> NO FUCKING WAY
[4:31:00] <%TheGreatSkenardo> He wanted a booty call, and instead he got a duty call
[4:31:00] <%Maximilian_DOOD> AERITH IS DEAD
[4:31:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> WAIT
[4:31:01] <Sol_Install> WIESS
[4:31:01] <pilllowofbees> TIME PARADOX
[4:31:01] <+RaveBV> This scene with Zack could be a red herring. People keep thinking that Aerith not being there means its because she left with the others, but that's assuming Zack time traveled. By Zack's time it should have only taken some months to get there, while current Aerith is years in the future. His Aerith might just be out.
[4:31:01] <SomersaultJustice> EVERYTHING RESOLVED
[4:31:01] <%superc37> that literally makes no sense
[4:31:02] <%YakumoYomi> No separate timelines, I guess
[4:31:03] <%heartlesshealer> wait he dimension hop?!?!
[4:31:03] <T_Sasquatch> Stop thinking lol
[4:31:03] <$RealThiele> good guy with conscience actually worries
[4:31:04] <GManx0> If they are in the same timeline, where is his cloud
[4:31:04] <%whyskeywolfe> Go fight the OC
[4:31:05] <majindusto> AERTH DEAD  ZACK
[4:31:06] <+PlatinumRevol> My theory is that the time ghost shenanigans made him jump timelines but since the plot can't happen with him alive something's gonna pop off
[4:31:07] <+neonNeptunian> WEISS
[4:31:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, Weiss is a bonus boss
[4:31:08] <+MelodyMedley> OH BOY
[4:31:10] <+michingmallecho> I want to play part 2 NOOOW
[4:31:10] <agadejobi> I get it
[4:31:11] <marcomatame> THEY BROUGHT THE OG VA BACK? THAT SOUNDED LIKE OG ZACK
[4:31:11] <%BudaBryan> Not the same timeline
[4:31:13] <mattdaddyd365> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[4:31:13] <mak0t0yukii> GIVE PAT A MOMENT
[4:31:13] <SailingSaturn> Max LUL
[4:31:14] <Blank9> if it's an alternate timeline, it means they didn't have cloud to do the bombing mission and everything else, so aerith would be captured by the turks and avalanche would probably be slow
[4:31:14] <%FreeFuzeIcedTea> ALTERNATE TIMELINE WHERE AERITH DIED AND ZACK SURVIVED, FLOWERS ARE WILTED AND NO HOLE IN ROOF
[4:31:14] <%barrakuta371> Wait is this same timeline? I'm so confused
[4:31:15] <%0oki> imo aerith is dead in that timeline because there are no ghost @PatStaresAt
[4:31:15] <SaltyAzteca> So Zack is ALIVE, but he missed Aerith, is he gonna think she died?
[4:31:16] <balthazar758> hopefully it will be cool
[4:31:17] <+Arxel1> Is that weiss?
[4:31:17] <%Ne1son> Fight Weiss
[4:31:17] <+red_cuppa> aerith might be dead
[4:31:17] <goddamndavid> is it over?
[4:31:17] <iheartmota> ONLY ONE AERITH REMAINS
[4:31:17] <+OmegaWeltall> you deed et
[4:31:18] <+ghostfaceninja_> LUL Max
[4:31:20] <Frostilk> max LUL
[4:31:20] <skyentombment> MA MA MA MAKE MY YUFFIE MAKE MY YUFFIE, PEACE EM OUT LIKE SHO
[4:31:20] <Sapphire_Breeze> now do Weiss
[4:31:21] <+Frranky> Weiss is a bonus boss and will absolutely fuck you up
[4:31:21] <devanmuse> So does that mean there are TWO Clouds in this timeline?
[4:31:22] <%ape_hawk> WEISS, YOU DUMBASS
[4:31:23] <IntrepidEye> Confusing for everyone
[4:31:23] <%Monkeyweed21> MAX NO THERES NO EVIDENCE OF THAT
[4:31:23] <mr_saturday93> timeline merges?
[4:31:24] <%asgard147> You.......did it limesSip
[4:31:27] <$StrawberryPantsu> WEISS THE IMMACULATE
[4:31:28] <monopolyman001> i wouldnt be surprised if areith is dead in the timeline zack is alive
[4:31:29] <GManx0> He was with Cloud on his way to Midgard. It wasnt the same timeline
[4:31:30] <tattleworm> @PatStaresAt they're the same npcs from the ff7r intro, they're refugees from the reactor 1 bombing
[4:31:30] <%spartanghost004> oh she died
[4:31:31] <+justianxix> no it didn't?
[4:31:31] <+tigerfang86> ???????????
[4:31:32] <+AutechreTwinAphex> shocked Pat
[4:31:33] <Saltmeisterr> ME?
[4:31:33] <+tigerfang86> ?????????????????????
[4:31:33] <%alcors_wisdom> congratsion you have had the final fantasy
[4:31:33] <+BIumen> died....when?
[4:31:33] <Wolfstriker121> YES!!!
[4:31:37] <Virokwet> what?
[4:31:37] <Explodincatz> whos Zack
[4:31:37] <KitsuneManami> Flowers were nto Wilted and there was Light..........
[4:31:37] <Ghostduck01> atleast he doesn't sound racist in this one
[4:31:39] <%asgard147> Max came up with that
[4:31:40] <Saltmeisterr> G O N G A G A
[4:31:42] <Wolfstriker121> it has to be
[4:31:42] <Blank9> I think it's just aerith is captured by turks/shinra
[4:31:43] <Jrocy247> Hmmmm
[4:31:43] <tyrianfolly> Chrono Cross??
[4:31:43] <ARobotFromtheFuture1> Weiss time
[4:31:43] <jorniev> WHAT?
[4:31:44] <%Ipsenscastle> so no time passed for Zack between the last stand and the S7 plate dropping???
[4:31:45] <%BarujaraciGaming> what the hell just happened
[4:31:45] <%Robot_Nixon_> Bruh idk NotLikeThis
[4:31:47] <+RaveBV> @PlatinumRevol That's assuming he had to jump in the future though. Aerith may just not be there at this moment... or he traveled to AC, since it looks lkike people are there for the stigma.
[4:31:49] <+MelodyMedley> Max's theory
[4:31:49] <%Monkeyweed21> thats not true
[4:31:51] <nicversus> Me? Gongaga
[4:31:51] <oOZtkOo> thats what max came up with
[4:31:52] <Ultimatefool> When did she die then...?
[4:31:52] <+BIumen> @PatStaresAt Does this mean there are 2 Clouds?
[4:31:53] <mak0t0yukii> LUL
[4:31:53] <tyrianfolly> Definitely a Chrono Trigger game.
[4:31:54] <%LaughingCatt> nobody knows, everyones on crazy theory time or crazy salt time lobosShrug
[4:31:55] <Jrocy247> But why would Aerith be dead in this timeline???
[4:31:55] <$SGrim> Zack truely is the final fantasy
[4:31:56] <MechanizedGentleman> REEEEEEEAH
[4:31:59] <%DashXero> I don't think it's time travel at all.
[4:32:00] <%heartlesshealer> eh
[4:32:01] <solid2272> the cross in the back of the church is a different color then the one you see in the remake
[4:32:01] <+NoShameNetwork> Some think it's refugees from mako reactor 1 and not the plate fall. However Zack "survived" 3 months before FFVII began, way before either plate fall or reactor bombings.
[4:32:01] <$StrawberryPantsu> No. Zach also makes a hole
[4:32:02] <StarlitStunner> Max do be crazy tho
[4:32:02] <%spartanghost004> it's true cloud is comatose so he never joined avalanche so he never saved her
[4:32:02] <+Kaask> max didnt come up with that. that was the prevailing theory chat told max.
[4:32:03] <%alcors_wisdom> but time ghosts are dead now
[4:32:04] <+CookieCutter007> NOMURA
[4:32:04] <%Maids4lyfe> the flowers weren't wilted
[4:32:05] <%Caped_Eggy> Max's crazy
[4:32:05] <$RealThiele> people are using the church as a place to stay flowers are gonna get trampled
[4:32:05] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> IT says alot that they made you care about that Sonon even when knowing he was gonna die
[4:32:06] <+red_cuppa> this is my favorite part
[4:32:06] <+Calek> I think he just got shunted into a different timeline
[4:32:07] <%Robot_Nixon_> REWIND AND ENHANCE
[4:32:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> G O N G A G A
[4:32:08] <iheartmota> Cause Zack's alive
[4:32:08] <PartyFavors> I think he's just gotten booped into the current timeline
[4:32:09] <SaltyAzteca> LAVOS IS THERE SOMEWHERE
[4:32:10] <neraren> Chrono should just show up
[4:32:11] <+Qsmash_> here we go
[4:32:12] <Virokwet> i mean im good on fan tehoreis
[4:32:13] <+ratreborn> Zacks alive in a different timeline
[4:32:13] <IntrepidEye> Max didn't come up with that. He was spit balling a shit ton of ideas
[4:32:16] <vance168> I think its timelines converging
[4:32:17] <+AutechreTwinAphex> at this point the writers are taking direct story direction from Max's streams LULW
[4:32:17] <tattleworm> alt timeline where cloud never joined avalanche and aerith doesn't have plot ghost protection
[4:32:17] <+BIumen> Zack had Cloud with him
[4:32:19] <%Eaglestrike117> Remember, Zack would have got to midgar BEFORE the plate fall
[4:32:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Zack came back covered in a tire track
[4:32:21] <GManx0> He had a CLoud when he survived. So they gotta explain that
[4:32:23] <Wolfstriker121> so if there is two timelines...one that zack is alive...then where is cloud?
[4:32:23] <StarlitStunner> GONGAGA
[4:32:25] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Or have taken his sword
[4:32:25] <blackjack8182> Take it all in
[4:32:26] <%whyskeywolfe> Pat stop indulging this nonsense
[4:32:26] <%heartlesshealer> can't be time shit, this is RIGHT after final fight saving cloud
[4:32:27] <%LaughingCatt> ZACKALANCHE
[4:32:27] <blue8moon> time fuckery
[4:32:28] <robintact> @PatStaresAt Zach means there's still a Cloud he brought with him after the end of Crisis
[4:32:28] <+sonicitus> NOMURA DIDN'T WRITE THIS ASSHOLES
[4:32:29] <macathelo> zack is time travler now
[4:32:29] <%kaizerlith> Even if Cloud didn't fall there should be a hole in the church roof from Zack falling in CC.
[4:32:29] <%Robot_Nixon_> PEPE SILVA
[4:32:29] <%asgard147> He'd still be comtose
[4:32:31] <i_chevalier> make sense. if the sword was there after.
[4:32:33] <majindusto> MAX JUMPING  TO CONCLUSIONS?  WHY NEVER enigmaKEK
[4:32:33] <%superc37> if its not time travel then how tf is cloud still like this
[4:32:33] <Sapphire_Breeze> GONGAGA
[4:32:33] <cohnjena13> I don't give a shit about theories until Remake Part 2 gets a proper release date.
[4:32:33] <AllenDeadman> he wouldn't save aerith
[4:32:34] <%Parapattern> We truly are the FF7R Intergrade
[4:32:34] <Zebroneath> Aerith would be taken
[4:32:34] <ARDM112> Aerith would get taken
[4:32:37] <CHVMPLOO> yea prob
[4:32:37] <blackjack8182> gongaga
[4:32:37] <%NocturneNovember> YES
[4:32:38] <vance168> I think we have two clouds running around
[4:32:38] <iheartmota> CORRECT
[4:32:42] <Phillipsayshi> Zack's in the future.
[4:32:44] <%HiroTSK5> Can't wait for Part 2 where Zack's going to be our new Laguna (and reuse Midgar Assets)
[4:32:45] <tattleworm> or she's a casualty of the reactor bombing
[4:32:45] <Uselesswhitenoise> AND SHE AND RED MAKE BABIES
[4:32:45] <+BIumen> But thats jumping ahead like 5 years
[4:32:46] <tyrianfolly> Zack had a Cloud
[4:32:47] <Blank9> aerith would get taken even earlier
[4:32:48] <Wolfstriker121> there you go
[4:32:48] <+strifexfair> its possible that after the plot ghosts died, zack just snapped back into the universe. my brain hurts
[4:32:49] <+eanscrale> Oh shit
[4:32:49] <chamblers> HMMM
[4:32:50] <Guardiansaiyan> dang
[4:32:50] <%heartlesshealer> but that's years after he came back
[4:32:51] <+JohnnyBluegrave> my theory is that its the timelines converging
[4:32:51] <%ComfortableStranger> Gonzaga?
[4:32:52] <MechanizedGentleman> @sonicitus everything wrong with Final Fantasy is Nomura's fault
[4:32:53] <%ConLin_Arts_> we will finally see the weird Aerith Red XIII baby
[4:32:53] <%wibbwobbler> It would be weird if he just popped in
[4:32:53] <$RealThiele> which she let herself be captured anyways
[4:32:54] <tyrianfolly> Zack limped into town with a Cloud
[4:32:55] <%spartanghost004> that or she died when the mako reactor exploded
[4:32:57] <SaltyAzteca> We need more info
[4:32:57] <+KawaiiJetty> I mean, wasn't there a different Stamp when they showed Zack?
[4:32:58] <IntrepidEye> And Aerith gets the Red Rocket
[4:32:58] <+hatok> and the plate would still fall
[4:32:58] <monopolyman001> yeah turks could have her too
[4:33:00] <PartyFavors> That's possible
[4:33:02] <%Valdorick> Except why would Cloud not being part of Avalanch lead to refugees in the church?
[4:33:02] <+buffn99> Cloud and Zack vs Sephiroth in part 3 CONFIRMED
[4:33:03] <%VashyronM> Also remember that plot ghosts don't exist anymore to prevent shit from happening.
[4:33:03] <%asgard147> YEP
[4:33:03] <SailingSaturn> Yup
[4:33:05] <+justianxix> I hate this theory shit, I rather just wait to see what crazy bulshit they do for the next game and see if I hate it or not
[4:33:06] <+megaman_sentinel> yea
[4:33:06] <%spartanghost004> exactly
[4:33:06] <+AutechreTwinAphex> I legit think Zack's timeline is the actual 'bad timeline' - Aerith gets taken to Shinra HQ earlier and experimented on
[4:33:07] <Blank9> zack it's up to you to finish off deepground and erase our spinoff mistakes
[4:33:07] <+MelodyMedley> Could be anything
[4:33:09] <balthazar758> she's flower jesus
[4:33:09] <AllenDeadman> very much doomed
[4:33:10] <Jrocy247> YUP
[4:33:10] <KainZero0> bruh we need the VLR timeline chart for this shit
[4:33:10] <+CelioHogane> @HiroTSK5 Plot twist, This is a teaser for the ZACK DLC
[4:33:10] <willsin4fun> but why would zack wait so long to go to the church
[4:33:10] <skyentombment> AERITH IS DEAD
[4:33:12] <+SilverDevilfish> There's going to be so many theories on FF7R2 that no matter what direction it goes in there's going to be a lot of angry people that it's not THERE FF7R2.
[4:33:12] <T_Sasquatch> why couldnt they just remake it like normal people ...
[4:33:13] <GodOfChocobos> Max "Deepground will just be VR" Dood
[4:33:13] <%TheGreatSkenardo> I mean she died a little in the main timeline
[4:33:14] <%ZComiX> But cloud survived?
[4:33:15] <+UKOrigin> BAD END TIMELINE
[4:33:15] <%superc37> this is so fucking stupid
[4:33:15] <%spartanghost004> who else can save them?
[4:33:16] <%moonmintparadise> no way they will change the story this hard
[4:33:17] <+Koldsned> ANd Cloud is sat somewhere mumbling to himself
[4:33:18] <%alcors_wisdom> i mean the canon timeline is kind of doomed anyways
[4:33:18] <+MelodyMedley> Yeah...
[4:33:19] <theredfox930000> nah it's probably better
[4:33:20] <Sapphire_Breeze> it's fine
[4:33:21] <+lucaflowe> Aerith being dead means no Holy
[4:33:21] <AllenDeadman> oh
[4:33:22] <SaltyAzteca> That is true
[4:33:22] <monopolyman001> oh no its unraveling NotLikeThis
[4:33:25] <%Jekado> HOW DOES TIME WORK?!?!
[4:33:25] <%DashXero> That's part of why I'm certain that it's not time travel.
[4:33:26] <%whyskeywolfe> He's literally got an army of failed clones to command
[4:33:26] <Sol_Install> But seph should know how this wil go already
[4:33:26] <Wolfstriker121> so not a doomed timeline
[4:33:27] <iheartmota> Yea we don't know for sure
[4:33:27] <+lucaflowe> And No Black materia
[4:33:28] <+Xeno351> unless nomura just says he can
[4:33:28] <%linSP> KILL AERITH NOW
[4:33:29] <%spartanghost004> he would have found a way
[4:33:29] <SomersaultJustice> so it would be the best timeline?
[4:33:30] <AllenDeadman> this is interesting...
[4:33:31] <+lucaflowe> It's a standstill
[4:33:32] <macathelo> Maybe zack traveled to the future
[4:33:34] <tacotaskforce> Looking forward to playing a 4 hour Zach episode when FF7R gets released again on the PS6
[4:33:36] <+BIumen> this feels very intentionally vague
[4:33:36] <Sporkgasm> okay so how does Genesis factor in LUL
[4:33:37] <%cosmosjester> aeris candt do the prayer to the planet with the white materia either
[4:33:37] <Wolfstriker121> so seth have to get it some other way
[4:33:37] <BrickleBork> no meteor PogChamp
[4:33:37] <+fusionsdf> in the game, they talk about how seph could have just found another stooge to grab the black materia
[4:33:38] <nilla_24> maybe aerith from one timeline will fix that idk lol
[4:33:38] <ChungusQuest> Time Ghosts in ruins
[4:33:39] <$RealThiele> Jenova could still cause some problems tho
[4:33:39] <marcomatame> @MechanizedGentleman But the only Final Fantasies he directed was this one and Versus XIII tho
[4:33:39] <battlexqueen> just has todie EARLIER
[4:33:40] <%walternatorz> When does Zack get re-introduced into the timeline? Is he arriving at midgar at the same time cloud would?
[4:33:40] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @GodOfChocobos in a way he was right, Weiss was just VR and Nero was just a Metal Gear boss
[4:33:41] <Wobuzhidao> Pee then Weiss?
[4:33:42] <tattleworm> if she was captured, no cloud to stage a rescue either
[4:33:42] <NaturalGear> so it's just... a boring timeline?
[4:33:43] <%heartlesshealer> [???] Timeline
[4:33:44] <+Kaask> fight weiss you coward
[4:33:45] <%asgard147> unless ZACK ends up getting it instead
[4:33:46] <%AzureGale> Smooth
[4:33:48] <Explodincatz> bad mystery box
[4:33:48] <%spartanghost004> that or the turks use aerith to get their first
[4:33:49] <%GalacticaPhanto> That means Vincent is cucked in every timeline lol
[4:33:51] <Broken_Sonex> Either way, people are gonna hate it i will not care
[4:33:53] <+fetrigon> PunOko PunOko PunOko
[4:33:53] <StrrLion> It's not a doomed timeline but it's a stagnant timeline
[4:33:54] <SaltyAzteca> TIME SHENANIGANS
[4:33:55] <Jrocy247> What if Shinra was able to discover the Black Materia?
[4:33:55] <Owkono> there isn't enough informaion
[4:33:56] <+Koldsned> But Cloud would still be a black cloak person wouldnt he?
[4:33:56] <%Valdorick> Infact, if Cloud isn't part of the team, does Sector 7 Plate even fall?
[4:33:57] <%MidnightBurst12> cool
[4:33:57] <%Garthunox> the temple isnt dependent on aerith
[4:33:57] <%Monkeyweed21> It still means the Weapons will destroy Midgar

[4:34:11] <$RealThiele> is he australian?
[4:34:22] <%YakumoYomi> Kirby says some crazy things, but cuddling with a machete is something I can get behind

[4:34:33] <%LaughingCatt> what the fuck
[4:34:33] <Wolfstriker121> so that means jessi and the others are still alive then in zacks timeline?
[4:34:34] <GodOfChocobos> @AutechreTwinAphex Weiss is literally in a cutscene though. And the VR is Hojo preping his Data ghost LARP. I don't perosnally mind it but it felt like he was coping
