[0:11:52] <+lordericter> Hey Pat, tip now that I have watched a lot of pre content for this game.  Cavalry is now worthless because the charge reflection bug that they fixed in the last 2 games is back so almost all of a cav units charge damage bonus gets dealt to it when they move anywhere close to a unit with anti-large
