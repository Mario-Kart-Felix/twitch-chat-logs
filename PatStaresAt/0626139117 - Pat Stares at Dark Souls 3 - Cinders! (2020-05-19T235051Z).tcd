[0:06:58] <%Valdorick> Really!?
[0:07:01] <zamzoph> honestly, at the rate Pat as going at, how long would it have taken him to finish P5R?
[0:07:01] <%Valdorick> :_(
[0:07:05] <%Nobrev> i figured p5r wouldn't end up getting the full playthrough treatment. atlus is insane
[0:07:15] <Gallhint> p5 was a good game but bad stream
[0:07:20] <%Valdorick> Hurts man.
[0:07:24] <Sundaysmiles01> some people are already streaming NG+ PS5
[0:07:26] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Hey who knows how much a sub from Subway costs, I’m hungry
[0:07:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but I get not wanting to play 100+ hours of mostly the same game
[0:07:32] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah remember when Gainax was like "Hey we g ot stuff to tease PS&G coming up" and then like nothing ever happened.
[0:07:38] <+pectusumbra> It is a shame we didn't get to Makoto awakening at least

[0:08:16] <@SoFarFetched> It's okay the P5R ended the best way it could: Pat laughing his ass off about having Makoto on his phone and kissing it to bother Sae
[0:08:18] <%optimasmaximas> i mean, depends or the sub, but not alot of people like subway; you sure you dont wanna treat yourself to something better?
[0:08:26] <%ultimatetotoro> at this point I'd rather have another panty and stocking album than season 2
[0:08:28] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> I give P&G a 10/10 for the lolz especially the dub

[0:25:13] <%SirGO0SE> fuck you it's January
[0:25:14] <%GabeSweetMan> Admittedly the biggest loss from knocking P5R off the schedule is the loss of the "chill" stream game.

[0:37:04] <+SundanceShot> from soft's vision is bad, just look at armored core v
[0:37:07] <zamzoph> I swear they planned on you fighting Tomoe in Sekiro, at least in DLC
[0:37:11] <j0ustar> "It turned on ship it now!!!"
[0:37:14] <%SirGO0SE> it's true
[0:37:17] <%Valdorick> "Don't make a proper story, makes it harder when we just purge shit from the game"
[0:37:18] <blackbaron98> chopped N screwed
[0:37:18] <%Diana869> says a lot about everyone else
[0:37:18] <%patriotrenegade> And then you get people like the makers of Cinders to stitch it together BETTER
[0:37:18] <MooseoneLivedhere> and there worst
[0:37:18] <+Mitchellsocks> Genius's, the lot of them
[0:37:18] <%Typhaeon> Not wrong
[0:37:19] <%valriot> AND THIS THEIR WORST ONE LUL
[0:37:19] <$valkuma> if only sekiro was more fun
[0:37:19] <%purplehermit12> DS1 is unfinished
[0:37:20] <usurper_sos> Not even wrong
[0:37:21] <%optimasmaximas> true
[0:37:21] <Gallhint> sekiro dlc NEVER EVER
[0:37:21] <+BizmarkTheGreat> I was about to say
[0:37:21] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It sounds like i need to give them some of the lessons i'm learning LUL
[0:37:22] <ElenaManetta> but hey its a good finish
[0:37:22] <%ssjklyco> And it wasn't that great
[0:37:22] <+LastHazzerd> FINISHED you say? HMMMMMM.....
[0:37:22] <%dekkitout> Not false
[0:37:23] <Solidnick18> Yeah
[0:37:23] <ovan20> Sekiro is small tho.
[0:37:23] <1matheuw> @SundanceShot you shut your whore mouth about armored core buddy
[0:37:25] <+pectusumbra> Pour one out for Lost Kingdoms
[0:37:25] <+Mitchellsocks> They finished it, so it's worse!
[0:37:25] <GuardMeShielder> So that's why Sekiro is meh.
[0:37:25] <SGrim> And it suffered for it
[0:37:28] <TurtlesAndTentacles> wait really?
[0:37:28] <Robot_Nixon_> they cant keep getting away with it!
[0:37:29] <%Nupinoop296> i find healing in ff14 to be less stressful than tanking tbh
[0:37:30] <%Garthunox> @sofarfetched I cant get into the sub discord for months now, accounts are linked and everything, can you help me out?
[0:37:31] <Mr_Strut> Oh shit, I may have to play sekiro

[0:37:32] <critiquequartz> and its not the best souls like
[0:37:32] <%MonsieurHedge> incorrect, cookie & cream is fully feature complete
[0:37:33] <%Ynkubus18> Sekiro actually had the time and money
[0:37:34] <KNWatcher> sounds like their designers are not aware of how much the rest of the team is capable of
[0:37:36] <+SundanceShot> armored core is great, armored core v is bad
[0:37:37] <KaiserMario> It's more like every other game is trash
[0:37:39] <%purplehermit12> YES
[0:37:39] <%Diana869> @PatStaresAt what about bloodborne- oh wait the loading i guess
[0:37:41] <%optimasmaximas> yea

[0:37:53] <%Panquake25> that does make sense
[0:37:53] <%TaterBurglar> I've almost finished Sekiro and this is still the exact impression I get. Certainly looks and plays great, but there's a lot of places that I just go, "Actually what"

[0:37:54] <%optimasmaximas> that door LUL
[0:37:55] <usurper_sos> LUL

[0:38:04] <Solidnick18> true
[0:38:05] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt you think it's on purpose that you never fight Tomoe in Sekiro? Not even in DLC?

[0:38:19] <%dekkitout> Bloodborne has A LOT of changed/cut stuff

[0:38:22] <+BizmarkTheGreat> crikSmash crikSmash crikSmash crikSmash
[0:38:22] <@SoFarFetched> @Garthunox Might have to do a weird unlink/link it back up. Sometimes you gotta start over to make it work again. Like a "have you tried turning it on and off" if it hasn't been done already.
[0:38:23] <%Panquake25> the chalice dungeons have like a dozen half finished bosses too
[0:38:23] <%ssjklyco> They took a shortcut during development
[0:38:28] <j0ustar> Probably a load issue
[0:38:28] <%ChrisPlaysThing> i doubt that one, from a QA perspective
[0:38:29] <%optimasmaximas> hoo boy
[0:38:29] <superlit_1> the ps4 couldn't handle it
[0:38:30] <%TaterBurglar> I think Plague talked about once how Dark Souls 1 had places link together logically and then they threw that concept out the fucking window the second DS2 started
[0:38:31] <1matheuw> someone photoshops a tinfoil hat on pat
[0:38:31] <Futurecity10> Dark souls 2 doesnt count
[0:38:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> WHAT
[0:38:36] <Coystick> Oh God Dark 2 hurts the most
[0:38:40] <jhonxiolonn> that would have been awesome
[0:38:40] <Coystick> THE MOST
[0:38:40] <%Diana869> with ds2 it shows the most
[0:38:40] <%SvenHolgersson> YUP
[0:38:41] <%jobbedbone> nah its probably just theres no loading zones and theres a memory access error
[0:38:41] <zamzoph> Metroid Prime 2
[0:38:42] <TomFrank> that sounds sick
[0:38:43] <%Laecerelius> Man that sounds like it would'vbe been cool
[0:38:46] <+Blackjackal95> I don't get all the hate for Sekiro. I see it as more of a Mega Man-esque game.
[0:38:46] <+Stynklord> WHAT
[0:38:47] <+linSP> try out the glitched chalice dungeons, they’re sick
[0:38:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Man, that sounds super rad
[0:38:49] <mostundesired> SOUL OF THE BLOOD
[0:38:50] <+lethallylactic> WHAT D:
[0:38:51] <ExpressNode> Probably for the best
[0:38:52] <%SvenHolgersson> Dark souls 2 was such a disappointment
[0:38:53] <%starotter70> YO
[0:38:54] <%purplehermit12> I mean DS1 is also hella unfinished what with the fuckin' dragon demon assholes
[0:38:55] <+Stynklord> WHAT THE FUCK

[0:39:06] <1matheuw> Y NO SNECC?
[0:39:06] <SGrim> Jumbo snek Kreygasm
[0:39:07] <Calek> remember when in early DS3 concepts you were supposed to make your own bonfires as you progressed
[0:39:07] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> that sounds more interesting
[0:39:08] <OneShotZombie> People call DarkS 1 a 'masterpiece' but it's got so many wonky half implemented features and areas
[0:39:11] <%Diana869> dreg heap is fine but...
[0:39:13] <%optimasmaximas> yup

[0:39:23] <Coystick> Big PRIMORDIAL Serpent boss in Dark 3, GONE
[0:39:24] <Ashenik1> @PatStaresAt Will you vere come back to Sekiro? This IMHO has the best combat in Fromsoft games.
[0:39:24] <%herecomesmong0> MY BRAIN
[0:39:25] <$lotharrio> Oh man, but Cainhurst was cool and unneeded, huh?
[0:39:26] <theresnodiee> God damn that sounds dope
[0:39:26] <KNWatcher> wow
[0:39:27] <zamzoph> oooooooooh
[0:39:29] <%Ynkubus18> It was the basis for it yeah
[0:39:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Cainhurst was a disappointment too
[0:39:29] <%Agami23> the found weather effects looked so cool

[0:39:40] <%Order_of_Mystery> Just to give y'all a taste of From's cut content: Ciaran's Tracers are in the game's files, complete with a full, FUNCTIONAL moveset. Oh yeah, and Cinders puts that back in, along with her armor. Cinders > DS3, and nobody is gonna change my mind.
[0:39:40] <BourneWarrior> THATS WHY TTHE DOORS ARE SO BIG

[0:39:53] <mostundesired> PRESS X TO DOUBT
[0:39:53] <Coystick> Shattered
[0:39:54] <%possumwalsh1221> I feel like George rr Martin is slowing them down on purpose
[0:39:54] <$SoMuchMoreThanJake> @PatStaresAt Whoa, whoa, whoa, you expect me to believe that games CHANGE during development???? doodBait doodBait doodBait
[0:39:55] <Mr_Strut> Maybe Sekiro taught them to finish their games
[0:39:56] <Cnoir_Ultimo> "Probably"
[0:39:56] <%herecomesmong0> X to Doubt
[0:39:56] <j0ustar> Wouldn't bet on that
[0:39:59] <%SvenHolgersson> So it will never come out
[0:40:00] <+LastHazzerd> wait i don't think Acti is related to elden though

[0:40:01] <+OwlLightningMage> ARE YOU CRAZY PAT LUL
[0:40:02] <Namillus> But can we talk about how the logo of Elden Ring is just the Darksign with extra steps
[0:40:02] <dreamchaserhg> its bandai namco
[0:40:02] <1matheuw> probably,maybe,i wouldnt bet on it tho
[0:40:04] <the_sword_of_dusk> X to doubt
[0:40:08] <TheArrow_> it's hard to imagine elden ring being a stinker
[0:40:09] <+OwlLightningMage> FUCK NO LUL

[0:40:23] <%optimasmaximas> @PatStaresAt there's a huge castle or some shit hidden in the bloodborne files
[0:40:23] <%Ipsenscastle> GRRM isn't involved on an ongoing basis, he just wrote foundational lore
[0:40:26] <MooseoneLivedhere> blood soul
[0:40:26] <+Blackjackal95> GRRM only did the background mythology for Elden Ring. He probably finished a long time ago

[0:40:57] <+Blackjackal95> George came in for a day or two, maybe a week at most
[0:40:57] <FutaSnek> @OwlLightningMage This mod makes the game better tho
[0:41:00] <%weissguard> Chucking a Lightning Spear at Kos would be pretty metal.
[0:41:06] <%valriot> yeah cos theres nothing going on in the enviroment ever
[0:41:08] <BliVru> @patstaresat Pat theres a mod in NEXUS that adds the trick weapons with transformations and everything
[0:41:08] <$valkuma> because there are no weapons or skill treees
[0:41:09] <%Diana869> does ds3 have those?
[0:41:09] <Coystick> Sekiro seems like a much more managed project
[0:41:14] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> cuz they dont exist
[0:41:14] <$lotharrio> True, but it's pretty teeny.
[0:41:14] <%TheDullaMAN> Blood and Souls
[0:41:14] <Coystick> smaller scale
[0:41:15] <Ashenik1> @PatStaresAt Will you ever come back to Sekiro?
[0:41:18] <1matheuw> throw armored core v for good measure
[0:41:18] <$valkuma> theres one weapon and the moveset doesnt matter LUL
[0:41:20] <%TheWinged7> the the skill tee could have used more time in the oven though
[0:41:22] <Futurecity10> No one cares to find secret shit in sekiro
[0:41:23] <+BizmarkTheGreat> I feel like they had moree planneed with shurra but other wise I agree
[0:41:25] <%Ipsenscastle> Sekiro just seems scoped down in general
[0:41:26] <%purplehermit12> fucking Darksouls 1 has UNFINISHED AREAS
[0:41:27] <mostundesired> Soulsborne are RPGs, Sekiro is just an action game.
[0:41:27] <Namillus> Meanwhile Bloodborne is FULL of cut bosses
[0:41:28] <%valriot> Sekiro didnt even have content, cut what
[0:41:31] <%Jaxnos> none of you guys saying it's tinier or less defeats his point.
[0:41:32] <+OwlLightningMage> @futasnek I respectfully disagree.
[0:41:32] <Hopit> God I want sekiro DLC so fucking bad
[0:41:33] <%Valdorick> There is no Oscar quset line that is still in the game and shit.
[0:41:35] <chai_wolf> Should I play Dark Souls in order or just play whichever ones I want? I've played a few hours of DS2 and am liking it and close to beating Bloodbourne.
[0:41:37] <Gallhint> prosthetic tools?
[0:41:38] <%Crimpson> Isn't Bandai Namco doing Elden Ring with From Software?
[0:41:39] <%Agami23> and fun
[0:41:42] <%GohanHitsugaya> But Sekiro, is too fuckin hard...
[0:41:44] <+oda_flobunaga> There was nothing there to begin with
[0:41:45] <%holydeviant1> And ALL THAT JAZZ
[0:41:46] <+dante_must_die_exe> Sekiro has the skills and stuff
[0:41:46] <%Diana869> @PatStaresAt they also might have taken out any cut levels
[0:41:52] <Ashenik1> But combat is so fucking good though
[0:41:55] <+BizmarkTheGreat> ye
[0:41:55] <MoonObscure> LUL
[0:41:56] <+necrocannibal2> man, DS3 is the shit
[0:41:56] <pineapplepervert> Sekiro is just Dark Souls 3 with the RPG elements stripped down, and mob aggression and damage cranked up.
[0:41:57] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:41:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> low bars
[0:41:58] <%FacetiousAF> psaDab
[0:41:59] <FutaSnek> @OwlLightningMage Well... 1000's of other people clearly don't LUL
[0:41:59] <Coystick> Sekiro is "Hey what if we polished the boss fights also a little stealth?????"
[0:41:59] <%Valdorick> Nailing it
[0:42:00] <1matheuw> thats not a high bar
[0:42:00] <Treuan> Livin the dream
[0:42:02] <mostundesired> "Officially"
[0:42:02] <startstoprepeat> i feel like "cut" in a lot of cases is just things they reiterated on like the lake of mud stuff they just found in bloodborne this week
[0:42:03] <%valriot> Get off the stage
[0:42:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> Well that's debatable
[0:42:03] <%oddslogic> slightly

[0:43:45] <$lotharrio> I'd make fem-Pat do some situps, but I'd knock her up. Though I would leave her behind and not marry her.
[0:43:45] <TurtlesAndTentacles> i'd fuck a lady Pat

[1:06:04] <%Jaxnos> LUL
[1:06:05] <%purplehermit12> Dancer definitely had more HP
[1:06:06] <mostundesired> I'd say most mobs aren't as bad anymore.

[1:07:00] <%purplehermit12> @Blackjackal95 his damage is pretty low but that dancer definitely had a higher dark resistance and more health, probably to beat out darkhand losers or something

[1:18:38] <%MrBorisMakarov> BUT LEVEL LUCK THO
[1:18:38] <lilredmage> WHIFF
[1:18:38] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[1:18:38] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[1:18:39] <+MillerLowlife> luck is evil
[1:18:39] <+Pendragwn> D:
[1:18:40] <$ragingbrachy> get fucked
[1:18:43] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:18:43] <%g0atmeal> oh bye doggy
[1:18:43] <+oda_flobunaga> Pupp Snuffed
[1:18:43] <$valkuma> its because dark is humanity and luck is humanity in lore
[1:18:43] <warmnoid> dogcide
[1:18:43] <Monkeyweed21> You want faith for hexes
[1:18:44] <%starotter70> That poor pupper
[1:18:44] <%possumwalsh1221> Because it’s lucky bro
[1:18:45] <%BeatBo_2> That Dog just suicded
[1:18:45] <%Laecerelius> Doggo gonna fly!
[1:18:45] <Fro5tburn> suicidal doge PepeHands
[1:18:47] <Aydarkzero> No Luck bad :(
[1:18:49] <%gespenst25> Luck and darkness are linked to humanity. It's a lore thing
[1:18:51] <%MelBrooksKA> Do it coward
[1:18:51] <+j_mac2> Only evil people gamble
[1:18:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> @valkuma ^
[1:18:52] <Solidnick18> air bud
[1:18:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Dark is lucky?
[1:18:54] <KingdomGene> Being lucky is the most evil!
[1:18:56] <superchronicc> was that a bloodborne weapon?
[1:18:58] <%gespenst25> Maybe
[1:19:01] <Personified134> @PatStaresAt you can get spell catalysts that do stuff with luck, not direct scaling tho
[1:19:06] <ralphfromdk> because dark is from the soul and it's a human thing, bla bla bla, silly lore
[1:19:08] <%WhereIsWill> become DAHK PAT
[1:19:10] <ShinMaddrox> Lucky to find your way in the dark?
[1:19:10] <lilredmage> okay hearing luck being linked to humanity makes so much sense
[1:19:11] <Sauceboss15> Because luck is a human trait and humanity is dark
[1:19:13] <Aydarkzero> my main Save still only has 7 Luck LUL
[1:19:22] <+j_mac2> backstep more
[1:19:23] <spoiledbadger> item discovery is appearntly more valuable with this mod
[1:19:24] <%kiryuuva> !uptime
[1:19:24] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 19m.
[1:19:29] <+xeros720> luck helps a little bit with everything i'm guessing, like morrowind
[1:19:36] <Fro5tburn> FeelsAmazingMan giant magic sword
[1:19:41] <krymzen5> dark edge is so cool
[1:19:50] <$ragingbrachy> cookie bug
[1:19:52] <+xeros720> i thought you killed that lizard before?
[1:19:57] <%SirGO0SE> dark souls is a video game
[1:19:57] <rufus2k2> *very soft croaking noises*
[1:19:58] <%Laecerelius> EDGE!
[1:19:58] <%possumwalsh1221> The magic lock is fantastic for the lil lizards
[1:20:00] <$RealThiele> the warrior of dankness
[1:20:02] <Equirah> he killed 2, there's 3
[1:20:03] <Scrub_Seeker> @xeros720 there's 3 in this area
[1:20:07] <corepercentlives> luck ties to catastrophe that is 50 people winning lotto at the same time - the end
[1:20:07] <+twohitgood> dark edge + ring of infinite sprinting is way cheap.
[1:20:16] <rufus2k2> is mage range just line of sight? goddamn
[1:20:16] <%DrifterDMo> I have canadian news trending in my twitter feed that says Deadly attack at erotic spa in Toronto was 'incel terrorism,' police allege

[1:33:30] <%Laecerelius> ! MEMORY AT PAIGE !
[1:33:30] <%TheREALGirthMan> Flashback to shadow puzzles
[1:33:31] <%l3sovikk> Just make her play Cinders on her first playthrough!
[1:33:31] <The_Dudde> debobtJr
[1:33:31] <%TheWinged7> its just a bloodborne stage
[1:33:31] <+Snektor> paige = adjective?
[1:33:32] <BallerSwagBro9k> Memories go in and out in a single day
[1:33:34] <+xeros720> paige's doctor: "i keep running tests, but they just say PAIGE"
[1:33:34] <%possumwalsh1221> Yea it’s pretty good
[1:33:37] <laserbeaming> This is the Berserk Place
[1:33:38] <+oda_flobunaga> Sounds like shes been drinking
[1:33:42] <JDRizzle316> IT REMINDS ME OF HOME
[1:33:44] <%YakumoYomi> Don't worry: just have her play Cinders instead of vanilla DS3.
[1:33:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Paige is a verb, adverb and noun
[1:33:47] <%TheWinged7> cut down the corpse for item
[1:33:47] <jhonxiolonn> lmao
[1:33:47] <Aydarkzero> which shit kind ordered the caging in dark souls 3?
[1:33:48] <AllenDeadman> I mean there is a lot of shitholes in this world anyways
[1:33:49] <%DappercatEsquire> eh, it's a living
[1:33:50] <ShichiNoBushi> "Alive".
[1:33:50] <%dekkitout> The Undead Ghettos
[1:33:53] <The_Dudde> looks like bloodborne
[1:33:53] <zamzoph> Not alive. Undead!
[1:33:54] <@SoFarFetched> she will barely remember things,then misremember it
[1:33:54] <+lethallylactic> Btw, that ring/item Pat just got basically makes it so you can walk through the poison swamp at half health, because it heals faster than poison.
[1:33:55] <+Soulsbjorne> Jammed
[1:33:55] <%DrifterDMo> lets just take the undead, and put them somewhere else.
[1:33:56] <Ethel9727> Or they fill a tree with them
[1:33:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> that's how the big fuck tree happened
[1:34:00] <seanmartin025> GO BACK AND CUT IT DOWN
[1:34:01] <$lotharrio> Toss them in a pit!
[1:34:03] <CookieCutter007> missed item :(
[1:34:03] <Ner234> "solution"
[1:34:03] <Aydarkzero> noooo you can't just revive!, haha bonfire go brrrrrr
[1:34:04] <%DappercatEsquire> Is Dark Souls an allegory for immigration ???
[1:34:06] <+Snektor> but if everyone dies...is there no one to die again?
[1:34:07] <$RealThiele> they gave a tree balls to fix it
[1:34:08] <mobiusnightshade> If Paige had a Telltale Games prompt, it would be 'Paige will not remember this.'
[1:34:10] <%Valdorick> "The Undead Problem" sounds like something that ends with the words "final soluton"
[1:34:11] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[1:34:12] <+Flambage> @PatStaresAt The zone also reminds you of home huh?
[1:34:12] <+Calern> why is it a problem tho
[1:34:17] <%Laecerelius> terrible problems require terrible solutions
[1:34:17] <LoneFonte> @Soulsbjorne check out the dark dynasty mod, it's a mess but its pretty much DS dynasty warriors
[1:34:19] <rufus2k2> that's fucked
[1:34:20] <%DrifterDMo> magic gewd
[1:34:22] <%zestyArsenic> @PatStaresAt maybe theyre just assholes, maybe its not that deep
[1:34:24] <critiquequartz> have we seen a non undead at all in darksouls?
[1:34:27] <%moogleboy1984> No!! Grey Rat!
[1:34:27] <%DrifterDMo> magik stonck
[1:34:28] <HeaviestDownpour> @PatStaresAt So when you sit at a bonfire and it respawns enemies, is that you going to a different timeline?
[1:34:28] <jhonxiolonn> encounter? NULLIFIED
[1:34:31] <raveous> I meant aren't hollowed people like legit zombies?
[1:34:33] <%ssjklyco> Wouldn't it make more sense to build a door less wall around the bonfire so that they respawn with no exit?
[1:34:33] <JDRizzle316> WOW DARK SOULS IS SO EZ
[1:34:33] <+twohitgood> this mod loves to stack up the thieves.
[1:34:34] <Pookiedaexzile> "Wow this magic shit is hilarous" Every Magic user ever
[1:34:34] <Darkfire346> WHY NOT JUST PUT THE UNDEAD IN CAMPS, BRUDDA?
[1:34:35] <olaksi> pew pew you are dead
[1:34:35] <%Jaxnos> they seem taller
[1:34:35] <+oda_flobunaga> In other words, crematoriums in this universe are super horrifying
[1:34:36] <%BlackMage66652> So you're saying it's their Final Solution to the Undead Question? LUL
[1:34:36] <Arisato_II> Loreta's bone, pat

[1:34:42] <%BubbaRands> Great Dark Souls is comical now LUL
[1:34:44] <+SlappyMeats> Is Gwyn the eponymous "bastard" of the "Bastard's curse?"
[1:34:44] <%DappercatEsquire> heh

[1:34:45] <$RealThiele> warp hick
[1:34:50] <%TheREALGirthMan> Maybe their assholes are just deep
[1:34:50] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Is magic just OP now that FP regens for free?
[1:34:52] <%Valdorick> Heuhuehue... Bone means penis
[1:34:52] <+lethallylactic> @mohamedsaadart It's fake as hell.

[1:35:08] <+TheBitingIrish> Does this still have all the BS NPC ddeath triggers?
[1:35:11] <+xShenzi> You can snipe all the enemies from where you cut down the bone
[1:35:11] <%Agami23> you could just cheese it by blasting them down from up top
[1:35:12] <huskarl_zap> no final solution to the undead problem
[1:35:14] <Darkfire346> i dont see why they DONT port bloodborne, theyve done every other fromsoft game
[1:35:14] <jhonxiolonn> Some big swords are broke
[1:35:15] <+Soulsbjorne> disgusting
[1:35:16] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt What does melee get?
[1:35:17] <Aydarkzero> GIANTS ARMOR
[1:35:17] <Tucker0603> @patstaresat lightning arrow is crazy now, I fired into the sky as a joke and it curved and started to track an enemy
[1:35:18] <%DrifterDMo> i honestly love miracles in ds3
[1:35:18] <%Laecerelius> We Demon's Souls know!
[1:35:18] <$lotharrio> Nice
[1:35:21] <+BurkeBigsby> Is this not the mod that people remarked being harder?
[1:35:22] <+AbnormalVoid> Kreygasm

[1:35:25] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> is poise real again?
[1:35:25] <%YakumoYomi> Facetanking is a real option now
[1:35:27] <%TheWinged7> oh cool i can play my tank dumb wizard that hits things with his staff
[1:35:28] <goddamndavid> is this the Demon's Souls of Dark Souls 3 mods?
[1:35:28] <laserbeaming> Does this mod turn Poise back on?
[1:35:32] <Ultimatefool> Same with holy weapons, HOLY FISTS is pretty badass
[1:35:33] <+lethallylactic> Lorian's set has HP regen now, it's nice.
[1:35:33] <davey0000> Massive lightning build was my first go around and holy shit was it so much fun
[1:35:34] <+SinisterBroccoli> @Darkfire346 Because Sony
[1:35:34] <lilredmage> Poise is real again!
[1:35:35] <Aydarkzero> any use for the fragments yet?
[1:35:35] <iteruq> its all dosent metter if everybody turns in to trees
[1:35:37] <%Walkerartorias> literally anything and everything is viable now its insane
[1:35:37] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Even Bow's are viable! 250 Arrows! SeemsGood psaUp
[1:35:38] <mohamedsaadart> @lethallylactic dang lol . imagine the 60 fps pvp though, here's to hoping
[1:35:42] <$RealThiele> need a !mod
[1:35:43] <%moogleboy1984> aggro radius seems fucked
[1:35:46] <%DrifterDMo> you... did it
[1:35:49] <+Warnawl> Are there weapons/armor that make it like Bloodborne? Like regaining health from attacking?
[1:35:49] <%CuttleCrow> Cinders for DS3
[1:35:51] <usurper_sos> Totally not from Bloodborne
[1:35:54] <%TheREALGirthMan> Good old Dark Edge the Hedgehog
[1:35:55] <BallerSwagBro9k> Summon Solaire
[1:35:58] <%plus_on_black> Big boy noise
[1:36:02] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> what are fragments for?
[1:36:03] <+LandOfTheWay> now that he's got the bone, it's time to summon the green baby
[1:36:04] <Darkfire346> @SinisterBroccoli what, does Sony own the IP?
[1:36:05] <+Soulsbjorne> pew pew pew
[1:36:10] <Aydarkzero> i hope the enemies in Elden Ring talk shit like in Bloodborne
[1:36:10] <Arisato_II> massive murder
[1:36:10] <$ragingbrachy> this mod is ds3: good edition
[1:36:10] <atzi10> they really should fix the mobs agro patterns
[1:36:11] <%SirGO0SE> haha magic go brrr
[1:36:14] <UchiVsTheWorld> wow such challenge
[1:36:15] <%ssjklyco> True coward souls starts here
[1:36:15] <Personified134> fragments are for spell catalyst upgrading
[1:36:18] <rufus2k2> EASY FARMER BROWN
[1:36:18] <jhonxiolonn> What i like about the mod, is that, it doesn't matter if something is super impossible hard, you can find a way to get huge and destroy it.
[1:36:18] <%DappercatEsquire> End of the Witcher right here
[1:36:21] <%DrifterDMo> well
[1:36:29] <+SinisterBroccoli> Darkfire346 Yes they were the publisher for Bloodborne and for Demon's souls
[1:36:30] <%MonsieurHedge> time for a disappointing rendition of my favourite bloodborne weapon
[1:36:42] <%domovoid> Incremental/clicker games: a fun way to kill time or a blight on humanity?
[1:36:44] <Personified134> the capacity for hugeness in this mod is tremendous
[1:36:46] <rufus2k2> DO NOT AVERT YOUR GAZE
[1:36:50] <%DappercatEsquire> @domovoid yes
[1:36:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Here's a game for you. Time in any first name + the Hedgehog and that's your Sonic character
[1:36:52] <%starotter70> Is this what Paige's family get together looks like?
[1:36:53] <%possumwalsh1221> That dark barb spell is so good wtf
[1:36:56] <$ragingbrachy> use rubbish
[1:36:57] <ElenaManetta> pat's invincible from a distance
[1:36:59] <ElenaManetta> just like real life
[1:36:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Type* fuck can't spell
[1:37:03] <davey0000> I kinda wished there was a cap on the boss memories, cause it can really kill the momentum if your compulsive and just farm Vordt over and over for big huge
[1:37:04] <maglebeast> How's it going Pat and Chat? We doing more mods or is this just DS3?
[1:37:06] <%SirGO0SE> I love DMC 2 souls
[1:37:08] <HeaviestDownpour> Just don't fight -anyone- and coward it all out. Amazing.
[1:37:10] <Darkfire346> @SinisterBroccoli but sony likes a money? why not do something that guarantee a big money?
[1:37:11] <Sundaysmiles01> spells are kinda spammy
[1:37:18] <$RealThiele> Preggo Sanic the blue hedged knight
[1:37:23] <+Erimos> @PatStaresAt there's a body hanging above the fire with an item
[1:37:27] <Aydarkzero> is soup still there?
[1:37:30] <+AbnormalVoid> piss easy and poop hard
[1:37:30] <critiquequartz> he says standing out of aggro sniping
[1:37:31] <%TheWinged7> you always did pat
[1:37:33] <UchiVsTheWorld> i mean with a black magic machine gun, sure its gonna be easy LUL
[1:37:34] <Tucker0603> @patstaresat if you infuse the hands to be holy they start glowing like you've got the godhand
[1:37:35] <+Lunarhawk> I mean shooting everything from 30 feet away infinitely is making a lot of it piss easy
[1:37:36] <Aydarkzero> oh Pat Kappa
[1:37:38] <%DappercatEsquire> Nice self correct dodge
[1:37:43] <%42nfl19> So is the only reason to get FP regen or the Blue flask is if "I want magic, and I want it now!" @PatStaresAt
[1:37:45] <Namillus> But if you're supposed to do Undead Village first, what's the small covenant banner for?
[1:37:48] <lunchbox_nick> Then how do you get here first
[1:37:50] <%kiryuuva> spoop.
[1:37:50] <ElenaManetta> gotcha

[1:38:16] <Aydarkzero> that doesn't make sense from a lore perspective Kappa
[1:38:18] <%ssjklyco> Is this Anor Londo?"

[1:38:40] <+OwlLightningMage> Estus Soap Soup
[1:38:40] <+SinisterBroccoli> @Darkfire346 thousands of people bought ps4s just to play bloodborne and they don't have any reason to put it on PC because they want the exclusivity
[1:38:43] <usurper_sos> Item missed
[1:38:45] <Monkeyweed21> BLIND
[1:38:45] <$ragingbrachy> estus is soup :)

[1:39:06] <Darkfire346> People like me would buy the Bloodborne PC port just to see if my PC could run it at 60fps
[1:39:07] <$raziel391> ONE OF THE CORPSES HAS AN ITEM PAT
[1:39:08] <rufus2k2> More like Essdus
[1:39:08] <+Redeyes_NI> @PatStaresAt thoughts on the mod? Worth using for a fresh playthrough or just kinda gimmicky?

[1:39:23] <+twohitgood> it'd make sense for it to be in the stables

[2:02:18] <%Ascethetic> psaBlep_SG
[2:02:19] <Zombrocom> The new rock spells are neat
[2:02:22] <%Typhaeon> I cast rock
[2:02:23] <%dekkitout> I cast [Rock]
[2:02:24] <%Laecerelius> You too can vomit out rocks!
[2:02:26] <+OwlLightningMage> It's so good
[2:02:32] <%Order_of_Mystery> @PatStaresAt You should be able to buy infusing essence at the bonfire's buy menu. Also worth mentioning that there are some things you can only buy at the bonfire, so check the menu often!
[2:02:35] <%SirGO0SE> pat are you still recovering from poo
[2:02:36] <mobiusnightshade> The rock spell has a lot of knockback, though.
[2:02:39] <HeaviestDownpour> Isn't the rocks pyromancy absurdly strong against poise?
[2:02:39] <Zombrocom> Havels ring got moved
[2:02:40] <segychan> What does the chainmail add for skills? @PatStaresAt
[2:02:46] <%Garthunox> I bestow on you the deadly sin of [GUN]
[2:02:46] <skyentombment> Is shooting a gun not just casting Rock?

[2:02:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> He's playing a modded version of dark Souls 3. If he connects to online, he'll get banned. It's not about being a coward, it's about maintaining his ability to play a game he likes
[2:02:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> chainmail gives no symp
[2:02:57] <%dekkitout> @segychan It add a bonus to Steiner math
[2:02:58] <%starotter70> psaCrazyhead_SG
[2:03:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Proud of him, he doesn't have to play the game for real, Its his sub, If PVP is too much for him he deserve the ability to turn down the diffculty

[2:05:21] <%starotter70> I counted 29
[2:05:21] <%버빌리열한번째발가락> noticeably faster
[2:05:22] <+Midashu> pat has a fast internal clock
[2:05:23] <ElenaManetta> dance
[2:05:26] <+dmtjinni> 28
[2:05:28] <Zombrocom> Base regen is 5%, shield is 1%, total 6%

[2:05:49] <%DappercatEsquire> @king_wragles Skeleton is to test how hard you beat ass
[2:05:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> .....10%
[2:05:50] <skyentombment> @Midashu and you'd think it's slow, if you considered his shitting
[2:05:50] <$ragingbrachy> the weed wall

[2:05:58] <%starotter70> psaPat_FC
[2:05:58] <Rellim80> 10%?
[2:06:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> 1% would be 3/10 of whatever you were counting
[2:06:15] <%Nikopol1717> I went with the 20% cheaper spells enchant but that looks nice
[2:06:16] <krymzen5> screw blue flasks tho
[2:06:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> rip rock throw

[2:06:49] <Tucker0603> @patstaresat try infusing the Censuring palm. I infused it with holy and made it look like I have the fists of god
[2:07:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> If Eldenring has PVP I really hope the meta ends up being more than 'circle around the opponent until lag lets you backstab them".
[2:07:02] <%starotter70> I just realized you can only mod these emotes for 24 hours

[2:09:05] <%Shadicara> Big man muscles ok buddy LUL
[2:09:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is there any actual challenge in playing a spellcaster in this mod? I mean besides against bosses?

[2:09:16] <%BlackMage66652> HE'S GOING TO HIT THE BACK
[2:09:21] <%CuttleCrow> yes dear
[2:09:23] <segychan> DICK FLATTENING
[2:09:23] <%GohanHitsugaya> psaBig man muscles activate
[2:09:24] <lilredmage> @CommanderSqueaks its all fun and games untill the distance is closed in by the enemy
[2:09:24] <@SoFarFetched> Cinders mod for DS3
[2:09:24] <%HouseofNonsense> It's the mod called Cinders
[2:09:24] <%Order_of_Mystery> pat's makin dung pies
[2:09:25] <+datcoolcat747> @tonfirean DS3 Cinders
[2:09:27] <BaslerJones> cbt time
[2:09:30] <waifoong98> damn, can't believe Pat got killed by his asses live on stream Kappa
[2:09:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Watch, it's going to take less time for him to hit the back than it took for him to take a shit.
[2:09:34] <SummonerMagno> PaintDump.exe has started
[2:09:37] <skyentombment> hit it and quit it to avoid losing souls
[2:09:37] <%YakumoYomi> @lotharrio I believe there are two others: a crab summon and a wolf/dog(?) summon
[2:09:57] <Gggamma_blazed> Is cinders too hard if ur casual
[2:09:57] <tonfirean> @datcoolcat747 thanks!
[2:09:58] <Zombrocom> @CommanderSqueaks Ehh... sometimes you run into magic resistant enemies, but honestly? Not really. Magic can really exploit the AI with how far the lock on distance is
[2:10:01] <SummonerMagno> oh god where does that lead to?
[2:10:05] <%SirGO0SE> this is my favorite stream ever
[2:10:07] <%Order_of_Mystery> wait, there are other summons!?
[2:10:15] <+Erimos> @YakumoYomi the wolf and crab were removed in the latest patch. too glitchy.
[2:10:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Paige is dumping so much Paint on Pats chest right now its ridculous
[2:10:23] <%Order_of_Mystery> how do you get them
[2:10:24] <+datcoolcat747> I wanted to go invade him with the sprint ring cuz I heard he was saying its bad for combat
[2:10:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> @zombrocom Yeah, when I saw that certain enemies not even being aggro'd after getting hit at certain ranges, that was a bit too much.
[2:10:30] <+datcoolcat747> To bad pats a coward
[2:10:31] <%SirGO0SE> I hope Pat's not sick tho
[2:10:35] <+datcoolcat747> too*
[2:10:35] <%YakumoYomi> @Erimos I see. Thanks for correcting me.
[2:10:35] <JDRizzle316> @skyentombment disregard Paige, aquire souls

[2:11:20] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt How was your second shit?
[2:11:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh okay
[2:11:21] <HeaviestDownpour> I never let it sit this long
[2:11:24] <%valriot> YEAH SURE LUL
[2:11:27] <BaslerJones> that was a fast ejaculation
[2:11:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dick thoroughly flattened.
[2:11:31] <%Mornaka> SO MUCH POO
[2:11:31] <$Draylle> not Apu?
[2:11:31] <Pookiedaexzile> @Darkfire346 In the Rocks voice "Who....Put there dick in my ass"
[2:11:31] <@SoFarFetched> has her back gotten better?
[2:11:33] <+datcoolcat747> Big poo for big boy
[2:11:33] <%CuttleCrow> poo : flattened
[2:11:34] <%Taisuru> If pat is not onscreen he is pooing
[2:11:36] <%BlackMage66652> @PatStaresAt Did you hit the back? LUL
[2:11:38] <Zombrocom> @CommanderSqueaks You can kinda make it better with the optional "afflictions", give the enemy some HP regen and higher aggro distance to make it less cheesy
[2:11:38] <Ner234> Guys - uhhh
[2:11:39] <gslayer14> her back is fucked up from you hitting it on the regular, sure
[2:11:40] <$lotharrio> Was it his butt-baby from Plague?
[2:11:41] <Sundaysmiles01> poo 2, the rectal reckoning
[2:11:41] <Vaardvark> do you keep your giant man muscles off camera?
[2:11:42] <pineapplepervert> it was C U M
[2:11:44] <TomFrank> "Pat it's 10 o'clock time for your dick flattening" "Yes honey..."
[2:11:45] <%SirGO0SE> it's okay Pat, you had a little extra stinkies to make that happens
[2:11:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> hit the back to fix the back
[2:11:47] <the_sword_of_dusk> he was quicker hitting it from the back than he was pooing
[2:11:47] <%valriot> Broken
[2:11:49] <ExpressNode> Pay is just congealed fiber
[2:12:18] <RetributionP> Paige needed the essence of Pat
[2:12:22] <+aWanderingKaivo> @HeaviestDownpour yeah but unless you leave it on the title screen often you might not have recognized the later portion of it I guess
[2:12:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> @zombrocom I feel like higher aggro distance is required to make the game actually challenging.
[2:12:26] <%Ascethetic> maybe ill try a bow build for once
[2:12:28] <Sundaysmiles01> We gonna kill a boss this sesh?
[2:12:29] <%GohanHitsugaya> Hey Pat, tell Paige all of us in chat hopes she starts feeling better soon!
[2:12:29] <%BlackMage66652> Don't call Paige an old broad

[2:26:40] <%Fooguwu> no
[2:26:40] <%starotter70> This feels like throwing boulders at animals in a zoo
[2:26:41] <%arancet> no
[2:26:41] <%g0atmeal> not really
[2:26:41] <theresnodiee> wow so magic seems to kind of trivialize everything
[2:26:41] <JDRizzle316> BREAKING THEIR BONES VERY QUICKLY
[2:26:42] <%bevyrage> crush it in the overworld, get crushed in boss fights
[2:26:42] <+Markalay> Pat is Bully from Bully Rockstar
[2:26:42] <%s_xylocalsingles> no
[2:26:42] <+nekodelic> YES
[2:26:43] <$galaxyswirl> no

[2:26:44] <%dekkitout> Absolutely
[2:26:45] <+SinisterBroccoli> yes it is chat
[2:26:45] <$ragingbrachy> yeah pee pee juice
[2:26:46] <+oda_flobunaga> This feels like an ARPG version of DnD Baldur's Gate Mages

[2:26:52] <%daemonazaezal> CHEST
[2:26:53] <Skullyton175> Ah dark builds, balanced as all things should be
[2:26:53] <%Panquake25> I never did a mage build in DS3. Really makes me wanna go back
[2:26:53] <ElenaManetta> im so good at killing bugs now
[2:26:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Guys, remember what Pat did for the LP. Why are any of us surprised that he loves this?
[2:26:58] <%Order_of_Mystery> Don't forget the sewers and da rats, Pat!
[2:26:59] <%daemonazaezal> BACK BY THE DOG HOUSE
[2:27:00] <%SirGO0SE> chat HATES peepew juice
[2:27:02] <%rlyeh7> where the dogs where
[2:27:02] <Kain5707> chat likes CBT
[2:27:03] <$galaxyswirl> it becomes very boring very fast just cheesing everything
[2:27:04] <ralphfromdk> ifnigohaha
[2:27:05] <%radiocrawler> It is. The ganks coming up you need to be as powerful as you can be.
[2:27:09] <%daemonazaezal> Other side
[2:27:13] <%YakumoYomi> The bosses are still a challenge, so it's fine. Souls games, to me, were always at they're best when you're duking it out with bosses.
[2:27:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TurtlesAndTentacles if you want a further breakdown i can provide
[2:27:14] <+OwlLightningMage> No challenge is so much fun...

[2:27:22] <$ragingbrachy> pat make us some pee pee juice dude cmon
[2:27:23] <%Hopit> part of me wants to download this mod, ram all the skills to 99 and see whats what
[2:27:23] <+cylish> don't forget how much dark souls a person plays is equivalent to how easy it's gonna be in the future
[2:27:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> @galaxyswirl Think about the Dark Souls 3 LP, and ask yourself again if Pat would get bored with infinite cheeseworks
[2:27:26] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @doc_ock_rokc Please?

[2:28:04] <ShichiNoBushi> Does that reduce it below the damage of a normal attack?

[2:28:11] <$ragingbrachy> more niche armor :)
[2:28:12] <HeaviestDownpour> When you put a shield on your back

[2:28:13] <%possumwalsh1221> back to the jinglejangle armor
[2:28:15] <+lethallylactic> The jester set torso still negates backstab I think.

[3:05:16] <+axel_silver> Can the big tree be replaced with big smough?
[3:05:17] <ElenaManetta> I'll be honest, the more I think about Smelter Dealter
[3:05:18] <+AppleBasket> I would personally say Black Knight Halberd is better than GreatScythe in Dark Souls 1
[3:05:19] <huskarl_zap> pat's onlyfans
[3:05:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> One of the base classes starts with a great scythe, btw
[3:05:20] <ElenaManetta> The funnier it becomes
[3:05:20] <+twohitgood> like DS1 great scythe instead of DS3 great scythe.
[3:05:20] <%Lizard0TM> there's a lot of new cool scythes

[3:07:21] <+Invlux> better kill him yourself
[3:07:22] <spoiledbadger> i think he might die after next boss, i made the same mistake
[3:07:26] <TapAtoLive> yes
[3:07:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Sphincter_Spelunker Yeah you right, Fate sucks
[3:07:29] <+wellshuckit> why no darksign?
[3:07:30] <%NopeBadguy> I think all Dark Spells are both
[3:07:30] <Baeltyr> yes
[3:07:31] <CurvedMetal> holy shit i finally caught a pat stream
[3:07:32] <Zombrocom> Mostly faith, usually 10 int
[3:07:36] <Zombrocom> as well
[3:07:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I velieve so
[3:07:37] <%Caidezes> Yes.
[3:07:39] <Scrub_Seeker> different mixtures
[3:07:40] <%trustycoyote> Yes but lean more on Faith
[3:07:40] <Monkeyweed21> hexes scale with both
[3:07:41] <huskarl_zap> @monkeyweed21 this
[3:07:41] <$lotharrio> Int minimums, most Faith scaling.
[3:07:42] <ECRead> aye
[3:07:50] <%Hopit> I wonder what Solaire would do to the dancer
[3:07:51] <chancho4tierra> Fuck pat i can stand you eating in the mic

[3:08:15] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> I think you have Picklepee items @patstaresat
[3:08:21] <%Caidezes> Miracles are stories. So you gotta believe in them.
[3:08:24] <%Axellogic> quick turn on RTX voice
[3:08:28] <Zombrocom> They scale evenly with both, but they have higher faith Reqs
[3:08:33] <%FacetiousAF> cronch Kreygasm
[3:08:36] <%otakon17> I see Pat is going for an INT build huh? Sorcery mostly?
[3:08:38] <+axel_silver> What are you eating @PatStaresAt
[3:08:38] <%trustycoyote> Correct. Dark requires both but dark sorceries reuqire more Int. And the opposite for dark Miracles
[3:08:38] <jhonxiolonn> THere's so many spells, and we're still lke this
[3:08:41] <Restainly> bye waifu
[3:08:46] <jhonxiolonn> Beat undyr
[3:08:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @otakon17 hex
[3:08:47] <%NopeBadguy> Dark Sorceries lean more towards Int than Faith
[3:08:48] <+RenoDeGeneric> You goofs just don't get it, you must cronch as well and eat along with Pat
[3:08:49] <huskarl_zap> turn on the built in spy war rootkit voip
[3:09:04] <%NopeBadguy> Ah yes, push your faith in the Elder Gods
[3:09:06] <%otakon17> about to say, doesn't HEX run off FAITH and INT equally?
[3:09:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> I wish I had a snack to cronch. But I already ate
[3:09:15] <ElenaManetta> gamer chips
[3:09:15] <+axel_silver> Chewing pork rinds into the mic.

[3:16:24] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt It's down in the pit that you unlock with the key, where the cleric girl is
[3:16:27] <%JumboCrunchies> Does this mod allow for the DLC areas, or is it Vanilla only?
[3:16:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> This is why Hagrid is a top speed streamer. Questions get shot
[3:16:30] <%SirGO0SE> is this nioh 2?
[3:16:31] <ElenaManetta> You dont make friends in dark souls
[3:16:32] <UchiVsTheWorld> what is paige doing

[3:20:24] <$RealThiele> oldthot begone!
[3:20:26] <@SoFarFetched> @CommanderSqueaks its true
[3:20:28] <DSD24> DS 3 had that cool ending
[3:20:28] <Zombrocom> RIP pretty much the entire Profaned Capital area
[3:20:30] <%Caidezes> None of the Dark Souls games were "finished".
[3:20:33] <+Erimos> That was a good addition, yeah.
[3:20:35] <%otakon17> Dark Souls 3 i THINK suffers from being made in the Bloodborne engine
[3:20:37] <%Panquake25> SKELETON WARRIORS
[3:20:38] <Baeltyr> were any of the souls games actually "finished"
[3:20:38] <%SirGO0SE> coffee tree hype is it happening?!
[3:20:39] <%YakumoYomi> Saggatha Coldvag will rise again!
[3:20:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @SoFarFetched Stop pushing coldvag for Summerslam
[3:20:45] <Pixel_Butts> hey @PatStaresAt is Paige gonna be playing that cute puzzle game helltalker??
[3:20:48] <+GenesisKnight> SKELEDOGS
[3:20:50] <%velemi> YEAH HEX BUILDS
[3:20:52] <%otakon17> well you can actually USE magic now instead of getting off like 1 spell and then having to rest
[3:20:58] <+AppleBasket> BONK
[3:21:01] <ElenaManetta> i would have loved if you died then
[3:21:02] <%NopeBadguy> All you're missing is some Lightning to go full Raiden
[3:21:02] <@SoFarFetched> @Sphincter_Spelunker psaDab
[3:21:03] <%Madbearv> is that raiden
[3:21:04] <ElenaManetta> right here after saying that
[3:21:04] <+Erimos> It'll just get more fun once you get new spells.
[3:21:06] <waifoong98> LUL
[3:21:12] <krymzen5> more DS games need this kinda build variety from the start
[3:21:15] <$RealThiele> the mod makes you op , but it also makes the important fights still feel good to beat
[3:21:16] <%otakon17> I remember when Lightning was good
[3:21:18] <+AppleBasket> yeah Pat is cosplaying Raiden from the Devil May Cry series
[3:21:21] <krymzen5> looking at u BB
[3:21:22] <%otakon17> I wonder if the Cinders mod fixed it
[3:21:38] <+maynardftw> I'm gonna play this mod almost entirely because I need to experience this game with a regenerating FP meter that isn't an insult
[3:21:41] <DSD24> You should have saw that coming
[3:21:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @otakon17 It did, from what I hear
[3:21:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @otakon17 that would take a miracle
[3:21:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Am I weird for having no interest in Daughters of Ash as a mod, but just for what I've been hearing is the super cringe fanfiction it contains?
[3:21:48] <$RealThiele> nah pat cosplaying as DEvo
[3:21:50] <%otakon17> THAT IS THE BEST NEWS
[3:21:53] <satans_finest_millennial> help! i want to like ds 3 really i do but i bounced off the tooter boss as an assassan and i want a staring class that will give me a shot. side note a beat gyobu oniwa firstshot in sekiro with no previous souls experience
[3:21:58] <+aWanderingKaivo> yup, one of the classes even starts with lightning spear
[3:21:59] <$lotharrio> Give to witches.
[3:22:00] <+Snektor> nailed it?
[3:22:01] <%Typhaeon> Dats a pretty good rhyme
[3:22:02] <$lotharrio> Witches LOVE scrolls
[3:22:05] <waifoong98> more dank hexes
[3:22:07] <%SirGO0SE> it's a scroll, it says "fuk u"
[3:22:11] <+Erimos> Item above.
[3:22:17] <krymzen5> its so nice
[3:22:20] <%radiocrawler> There should be a body above you with an item.
[3:22:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> It's a N pass Scroll
[3:22:22] <%dekkitout> Drrrragon

[3:22:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> clempsHappy clempsHappy clempsHappy clempsHappy clempsHappy clempsHappy clempsHappy clempsHappy clempsHappy clempsHappy clempsHappy clempsHappy
[3:22:50] <HeaviestDownpour> A sword bigger than any greatsword, and faster than anyy dagger
[3:22:55] <%otakon17> @satans_finest_millennial just keep practicing, you can parry Gunyr with good timing and it shaves off a HUGE chunk of health or use Firebombs they WRECK him
[3:22:55] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Remember how originally in this game, there was supposed to be a mechanic of creating your own bonfires?
[3:23:02] <$floralkami> WE COME AT NIGHT WE PLAY AT NIGHT
[3:23:05] <%Shadicara> The real rats were the people you met along the way
[3:23:05] <+TheOneCalledRock> i'm the big rat the makes ALL OF THE RULES
[3:23:06] <+encrouched> You can(not) Rerat
[3:23:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> But where is the giant rat that makes all of Da Rulez?
[3:23:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> @kaisermario That sounds busted as fuck
[3:23:13] <Pixel_Butts> clempsGin clempsHappy clempsGin clempsHappy clempsGin clempsHappy
[3:23:13] <%otakon17> and then the game puts TWO BONFIRES LIKE 10 FEET APART
[3:23:16] <+maynardftw> @KaiserMario What, like, a quicksave mechanic?

[3:23:32] <%otakon17> she's a good girl
[3:23:33] <$floralkami> let's see what kind of trouble we can GET OURSELVES INTO

[3:23:34] <+maynardftw> Jeez
[3:23:35] <+Erimos> "I must consult the elder gods."
[3:23:35] <ancrest_tant> Royal rat vanguard as regular enemies to show growth
[3:23:37] <%spiritofmojave> Stop touching other blind women
[3:23:39] <satans_finest_millennial> @otakon17 parry noted but is there an optimal start class?
[3:23:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @CommanderSqueaks it kinda was why it was removed
[3:23:42] <+AppleBasket> don't touch her Pat, her skin is LITERALLY crawling with humanity under the surface
[3:23:44] <%goatbait> goatbait subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Hi pat! Just got home from work, have a good stream! please pet the Emlo and Paige and the orb for me
[3:23:45] <%WhereIsWill> social distancing!
[3:23:47] <%moogleboy1984> fuck every Carimite
[3:23:49] <%SirGO0SE> @sphincter_spelunker tfw no blind gf
[3:23:53] <+TheOneCalledRock> jerma has cemented that fucking rat meme into the face of the internet with that dumb movie maker movie huh?
[3:23:54] <+Snektor> replace every enemy and boss with rats of varying sizes?
[3:23:55] <%NopeBadguy> All I can think of when I see Irina is the "Time for head" message from launch
[3:24:08] <%toolofparanoia> mfs from Carim can't be trusted
[3:24:12] <Solidnick18> nice
[3:24:15] <%otakon17> @satans_finest_millennial not really? The knight can tank an extra hit or two but overall any class can whup him with practice. Just keep trying
[3:24:16] <KaiserMario> @Commander_Spyke You can still see the beginnings of that concept with Gundyr, how you take the sword and use it on Firelink
[3:24:21] <$floralkami> @theonecalledrock it's catchy
[3:24:22] <%Panquake25> fucking brightbugs!?
[3:24:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> I feel like in the world of Dark Souls, something like Covid wouldn't even be a ping on the horrible malady rradar.
[3:24:24] <Zombrocom> BRIGHTBUGS. Of all the things to pull from DS2, why brightbugs
[3:24:30] <%maskofmichael> maskofmichael subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! A combo of me on a day off and Pat playing a game that won't spoil me when I play it? What are the odds? No seriously, what are the odds?
[3:24:31] <%otakon17> you have no souls though
[3:24:41] <+AppleBasket> just ask for it on credit
[3:24:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Why not Brightbugs
[3:24:48] <+encrouched> Buy buy buy (Buybuybuy)
[3:24:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @CommanderSqueaks because you can die and come back?
[3:24:50] <%otakon17> oh man I love Brightbugs
[3:24:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @maskofmichael 1 whole odds
[3:24:53] <+maynardftw> @Zombrocom Presumably because it was supposed to be in the game originally?
[3:24:59] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> dont forget you grabbed an estus flask shard
[3:25:00] <%otakon17> >Tricks of the Trade
[3:25:05] <%otakon17> oooh I like that
[3:25:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> @doc_ock_rokc No, beacuse there are so many other curses, plagues and just bad things that are so much worse.
[3:25:11] <%FacetiousAF> did he ever use the bone shard?
[3:25:18] <%SirGO0SE> covid would be a cure in the souls universe
[3:25:22] <%otakon17> @PatStaresAt has the mod caused any breaks or crashes yet?
[3:25:23] <HeaviestDownpour> So is every weapon from every Fromsoft game in this mod?
[3:25:23] <+TheOneCalledRock> i really need to play through the dark souls games, the only souls game i played is bloodborne and I have not beaten that yet
[3:25:31] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> @patstaresat I thought you picked up the Undead Bone Ash or w/e at some point
[3:25:31] <satans_finest_millennial> @otakon17 cool cool ya a gabe up after the 5th go. ill take another stab before 2077 comes out and my play list is exhasted
[3:25:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat should never resort to thinking
[3:25:38] <%NopeBadguy> That's what you get for pack ratting, dude
[3:25:41] <%radiocrawler> Inventory management
[3:25:41] <ElenaManetta> gosh this purse is just such a mess
[3:25:44] <+Solutha> put them in the box
[3:25:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> You literally brought this upon yourself.
[3:25:48] <+AppleBasket> bottomless boxx them
[3:25:51] <+Erimos> @otakon17 none. seems to run better than the base game.
[3:25:53] <%SirGO0SE> oops all swords
[3:25:55] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Gaandaalf!
[3:25:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @TheOneCalledRock that's actually a good place to start other ones. Bloodborne has a strong finish
[3:26:04] <%starotter70> It's only going to get larger from here on out
[3:26:11] <Pookiedaexzile> YOU SHALL EAT ASS
[3:26:12] <%otakon17> @satans_finest_millennial good luck, keep at it. I know he's a big daunting son of a bitch especially for the first boss but he's beatable just don't let him intimidate ya
[3:26:23] <%NopeBadguy> I like the idea but I'm not sure if it's practical
[3:26:26] <+AppleBasket> GANDALF RAIDEN
[3:26:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> So is he Raiden Gandalf now?.... Randalf?
[3:26:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Randalf the wizard?

[3:26:43] <waifoong98> Patdalf the weeb
[3:26:44] <%moogleboy1984> I'm not even supposed to be here today!
[3:26:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> grey or white?
[3:26:49] <%possumwalsh1221> Fucking Randalf lmao
[3:26:50] <legacy0117> Lol. Pat went Wizard.
[3:26:53] <%otakon17> man, TWIN attacks were so BROKEN in DS2
[3:26:57] <+Solutha> Randalf the Smelly
[3:26:57] <%otakon17> Pat went HEX

[3:26:59] <+TheOneCalledRock> @Sphincter_Spelunker i know i gotten a large CHUNK into bloodborne, but i'm not sure if i am near the end, i stopped because games were coming out
[3:27:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Randalf the wizard (Raiden + Gandalf)
[3:27:01] <+AppleBasket> Randalf is still a better name than Radderghast
[3:27:02] <%Shadicara> Raiden the white
[3:27:03] <tolloponik> wait dose it just allow you to craft boss souls?!
[3:27:04] <%spiritofmojave> Weebdalf
[3:27:04] <+TheOneCalledRock> and that was two years ago?
[3:27:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat went Warlock
[3:27:07] <%PettyFunk> Patagast
[3:27:08] <+TheOneCalledRock> i think
[3:27:09] <%maskofmichael> He looks more like Raiden to me
[3:27:09] <legacy0117> Ahhhhhh Hex....
[3:27:10] <%dekkitout> "This Gandalf lookin motherfucker just beat my ass, with a cane to the skill like 'None Shall Pass!'"
[3:27:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> Glandalf
[3:27:19] <%otakon17> I like that hat
[3:27:19] <+Erimos> @PatStaresAt you should check Yoel.
[3:27:23] <%otakon17> Glamdalf
[3:27:33] <%Shadicara> Already been established he's cosplaying Raiden Kappa
[3:27:40] <%otakon17> oh yeah Enchanted scales off of INT and does MAGIC damage
[3:27:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @TheOneCalledRock What boss? I can tell you. The DLC can be done after one point, but is best saved for the end
[3:27:42] <%otakon17> iirc
[3:27:44] <HeaviestDownpour> wtf was that skeleton @PatStaresAt

[3:28:32] <+Erimos> HEX HYPE PogChamp
[3:28:34] <%g0atmeal> I love the tsundere magic teacher
[3:28:39] <+AppleBasket> Pat you should try Dark Edge Kappa
[3:28:41] <%NopeBadguy> Numbness is hilarious
[3:28:43] <%QuadraticGravity> Reminder: If you want to keep Orbeck for any normal sorceries you have to give him a scroll before Abyss Watchers
[3:28:47] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Isn't it worth it killing yourself a bunch now to get free levels from him?
[3:28:50] <+maynardftw> Surging Deep: Giggity
[3:28:51] <+Snektor> time to burn those souls B O I

[3:29:21] <%QuadraticGravity> @otakon17 it's just a sell menu
[3:29:22] <Zombrocom> Sacrifice item = sell item
[3:29:23] <+maynardftw> Wait, repair equipment? There's repairing in this mod? Wait, was there repairing in OG DS3?
[3:29:25] <+AppleBasket> yes
[3:29:26] <+abrightlight> Those souls were turnt out
[3:29:28] <%otakon17> noice, I like it
[3:29:38] <Zombrocom> @maynardftw There was in fact

[3:36:41] <%otakon17> WHY IS THIS MOD WAY BETTER THAN VANILLA!?
[3:36:41] <davey0000> you can now get all boss weapons in one playthrough
[3:36:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> scrub mode, activate
[3:36:49] <%FacetiousAF> you got your monhun in my dank soles
[3:36:50] <+AppleBasket> Affinity was really good on Monster Hunter
[3:36:51] <legacy0117> YEAH they are.
[3:36:54] <%Taisuru> @otakon17 Many mods are, kinda the point generally
[3:36:56] <+Erimos> Have you visited Cornyx?
[3:36:57] <ShichiNoBushi> Neat.
[3:36:58] <%moogleboy1984> Every time Dark Bead isn't being cast you need to be asking "When's Dark Bead?"
[3:37:12] <%otakon17> honestly it's kind of surprising how much the game can be improved on
[3:37:14] <Zombrocom> I find affinity Adorable
[3:37:15] <%Typhaeon> Now you are the balls master
[3:37:15] <%otakon17> also they got little eyes

[3:37:40] <fuji_92> can't believe Pat's cosplaying naruto

[3:37:54] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> TRUTHSEEKING ORBS
[3:37:57] <davey0000> Memories are also kinda fuck busted, if you have a really stomp-able boss that gives a fat soul and fat souls, you can farm them forever for big huge.
[3:37:57] <+Soulsbjorne> Affine AF
[3:37:58] <%spiritofmojave> it popped :(
[3:37:59] <%maskofmichael> @CommanderSqueaks Stacks on stacks

[3:38:03] <+LTKonnor> Sage of the Six Pats
[3:38:05] <%trustycoyote> Not on testing dunny at shrine? @PatStaresAt
[3:38:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh dammit, that is the naruto balls. thanks, I hate it
[3:38:09] <lordchum1150> Is that the hat from the spin boys in sekiro?
[3:38:09] <+AppleBasket> Pat's friends keep dying
[3:38:15] <+TheOneCalledRock> pat truly has god and anime on his side now
[3:38:18] <%Typhaeon> Wow
[3:38:20] <+TheOneCalledRock> PAT STOP KILLING THEM
[3:38:21] <+GenesisKnight> Pat's killer balls
[3:38:22] <+LTKonnor> based
[3:38:26] <%otakon17> "BEHOLD THE POWER OF A GOD!"
[3:38:31] <%Order_of_Mystery> Pat ball run
[3:38:34] <+tweedler92> is Pat a Madara now?
[3:38:35] <funwashere> ultimate wizard battles yet to come LUL
[3:38:36] <%possumwalsh1221> Big balls of death
[3:38:39] <%radiocrawler> I’m so not used to seeing mage combat.
[3:38:41] <%dekkitout> What's next- Pat gets Limbo?
[3:38:42] <%WhereIsWill> can you cast affinity AND the sword orbs??
[3:38:44] <+Blackjackal95> so is the pvp community on this mod more active than vanilla now?
[3:38:44] <+TheOneCalledRock> LUL
[3:38:53] <+TheOneCalledRock> so did that do anything?
[3:38:55] <+JVolfram> Fear Pat's blueballs
[3:38:57] <leonelmarianog> wut
[3:38:58] <+Buytoast> local ash uses their fat balls to subjugate enemies
[3:39:01] <ElenaManetta> pat can't touch a skeleton
[3:39:03] <+LTKonnor> It did essentially 1 damage
[3:39:04] <gslayer14> pvp with this mod is hacker's league
[3:39:05] <%trustycoyote> So one click to summon them, next click to send them?
[3:39:06] <%JumboCrunchies> Im not sure it HAS a PvP scene, Blackjackal.
[3:39:08] <gslayer14> still good fun though
[3:39:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Congrat Pat, you are now a Naruto
[3:39:13] <%possumwalsh1221> Come! Behold the power of my balls!
[3:39:14] <Phob05> I thought that sound was from my game
[3:39:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It did stuff, El Hueso just has 100000 HP
[3:39:18] <+AppleBasket> no they fire automatically
[3:39:22] <legacy0117> Oh the Seketon is literally a target dummy. I WISH I HAD THAT.
[3:39:22] <%maskofmichael> Stuff?
[3:39:25] <%PaladinDupre> @PatStaresAt You can use the Sacrifice Item menu at a bonfire to consume souls faster.
[3:39:26] <+primax104> anyone think this slides the game to more diablo like combat? or like some other non souls arpg? Not that it is a bad thing.
[3:39:27] <$RealThiele> an std
[3:39:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Chat, I'm scared. There's a skeleton inside me right now
[3:39:35] <davey0000> You're more likely to run into THE CHAMP than anyone trying to use this in a serious sense for PVP
[3:39:37] <+TheOneCalledRock> ok was really confused
[3:39:38] <SpellboundWolf> Good evening from Indiana, my friends. birbHeart octoHewwo
[3:39:45] <@SoFarFetched> @Blackjackal95 you can't go online with this or else you get banned,but I think you can still get matched up with other players in the cinders mod somehow.
[3:39:51] <$RealThiele> spoopy level 5: there is already a skeleton inside you
[3:39:54] <+TheOneCalledRock> because that did nothing to skellmo over there
[3:40:11] <+Erimos> @PatStaresAt you have a pyromancy tome, don't you?
[3:40:14] <%jediofficial> Hey pat do you think DS3 should be the last game or would you want another sequel
[3:40:15] <gslayer14> getting banned just shoves you onto the hacker servers
[3:40:15] <Professor_Rakor> we can't be arst to make that spear
[3:40:16] <xmusketeer> I have this downloading as we speak, how funny this is what pat is rocking tonight
[3:40:18] <leonelmarianog> Everyone knows skeletons can't live inside a human body
[3:40:22] <+AppleBasket> @SoFarFetched you get placed on the "cheaters jail" it just so happens that everyone playing multiplayer is allowed to play together in Cheater Jail
[3:40:29] <+aWanderingKaivo> cornflakes
[3:40:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> @sofarfetched If you set your multiplayer passphrase to "cinders" you'll only get paired with people with the same passphrase (e.g. Cinders players).
[3:40:33] <%radiocrawler> If you take Cinders mod online you just change your password to “Cinders” and everyone using the mod can find each other in the banned section.
[3:40:34] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah you can only get matched in multiplayer as like a 'ban pool'
[3:40:34] <Zombrocom> S U R G I N G D E E EP
[3:40:43] <@SoFarFetched> @CommanderSqueaks yeah that's the part I was forgetting.
[3:40:49] <+GenesisKnight> SURGING IN THE DEEEEEEP
[3:40:49] <%MrBorisMakarov> LUL
[3:40:50] <%SvenHolgersson> ARE WE BLOODBORNE YET
[3:40:50] <Zombrocom> Honestly, I found surging deep kinda lacklaster
[3:40:54] <waifoong98> pew pew pew
[3:40:54] <aubrea> because you cant?
[3:40:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's fair, I never used Passphrases when I played DS3.
[3:40:58] <%xcompleasedad> More spam? Kappa
[3:40:58] <Chimeraelite> uh damn
[3:40:59] <HeaviestDownpour> The MP regenerates
[3:40:59] <+Jasuchin> This looks actually fun now
[3:40:59] <%trustycoyote> Just wasn;t viable. You'd be out of FP in a minute
[3:40:59] <%dekkitout> Pew pew
[3:41:00] <%SirGO0SE> i did this kind of build my first time playing ds1
[3:41:00] <+tuchpi> GUN
[3:41:02] <cam3lface> holy shit it's almost free
[3:41:02] <HeaviestDownpour> Almost faster than you can use it
[3:41:02] <+Erimos> THAT'S RAD
[3:41:03] <fuji_92> LUL
[3:41:05] <leonelmarianog> Most importantly, are you having fun P A T ?
[3:41:06] <HeaviestDownpour> It's infinite
[3:41:09] <davey0000> Dude I can't play vanilla anymore now that Lightning arrow is available so early
[3:41:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> You mean a super busted build?
[3:41:12] <SGrim> Machinegun PogChamp
[3:41:15] <+primax104> it is a diablo like build
[3:41:16] <waifoong98> why does it miss half the shots?
[3:41:18] <%WhereIsWill> sick PogChamp
[3:41:20] <Calek> might be good against bosses
[3:41:23] <gslayer14> half the projectiles are hitting the wall pat
[3:41:24] <Monkeyweed21> is it cuz you suck?
[3:41:25] <+primax104> or that is what it seems like
[3:41:27] <%bevyrage> it's good on the big, slow bosses
[3:41:27] <+TheOneCalledRock> wait, if we have skeletons inside us, does that mean they are drowning in our blood?
[3:41:28] <Calek> big beefy bosses
[3:41:29] <gslayer14> they have amazing tracking
[3:41:29] <+AppleBasket> I think we need Pyromancies
[3:41:32] <+Joelexion> Booty paste
[3:41:37] <+Snektor> actually yeah would it be good for bosses since they are more stagnant?
[3:41:39] <+AppleBasket> bring on the Forbidden Sun
[3:41:39] <davey0000> Lightning arrow was one of the best miracles in vanilla and now this mod just made it better
[3:41:40] <+TheOneCalledRock> because that is metal as fuck
[3:41:43] <+Blackjackal95> Yeah, but are people letting themselves get banned intentionally to play pvp on this version? Seeing as how everyone seems to enjoy a lot of the changes
[3:41:45] <%JumboCrunchies> I sorta wanna do a Dex caster build. But this mod is wild so I have no idea how it would work.
[3:41:49] <+Jasuchin> Sure it's weak, but it's fast
[3:41:51] <%YakumoYomi> Are you going all Dark magic, or will you be mixing in the normal spells too?
[3:41:52] <+AppleBasket> @Blackjackal95 yes
[3:41:55] <%Issun135> Issun135 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[3:41:57] <%radiocrawler> Elevator time?
[3:41:58] <davey0000> You can also do a NG + run as soon as you start
[3:42:01] <%Order_of_Mystery> can you buy a spell from karla's offerings, @PatStaresAt ?
[3:42:02] <%WhereIsWill> kill dancer?
[3:42:02] <LSpiral> I don't think Forbidden Sun is in this mod, I couldn't find it in the wiki
[3:42:04] <DXLelouch24> Battle mage is a go
[3:42:05] <kscars> hi pat, you're cool
[3:42:06] <+AppleBasket> @Blackjackal95 it's not a decision I'd personally make lightly though
[3:42:09] <%Nikopol1717> Black fireball seems like it does as much as deep barb, but comes out faster
[3:42:10] <+Lost_Zombie> @JumboCrunchies dex in this increases cast speed so it'd work
[3:42:11] <Zombrocom> Surging deep has this thing where it can only hit 1 per second, it's alright for PvP poking but it's pretty mediocre for PvE
[3:42:11] <%starotter70> Kill Jester
[3:42:11] <gslayer14> you can family share to another account and just get banned on that
[3:42:13] <+aWanderingKaivo> @JumboCrunchies dex increases casting speed so its not a bad idea
[3:42:15] <benjiFG> you even mentioned him
[3:42:21] <+Erimos> Cornflakes will have to wait, I guess.
[3:42:25] <%JumboCrunchies> Oh sick, thats amazing.
[3:42:31] <%radiocrawler> PC load times. Gotta love em
[3:42:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> big portobello
[3:42:40] <legacy0117> I used to participate in honor duels on Dark Souls 2, was fun times. I should hook back up my PS4 for updates, but eventually I'll get around to it.
[3:42:42] <Monkeyweed21> the nun too
[3:42:44] <+AppleBasket> I think the Devs turned off Family Sharing for DS3
[3:42:46] <%SirGO0SE> ssd stands for stinky smelly doody
[3:42:57] <davey0000> The first time you find a Bloodborne weapon is so jarring
[3:43:00] <gslayer14> @AppleBasket incorrect.
[3:43:04] <+TheOneCalledRock> i need to install games on my ssd. but it's so small that like, a 100gb game would fill it up
[3:43:05] <davey0000> It's so dumb looking
[3:43:06] <+TheOneCalledRock> it sucks
[3:43:08] <gslayer14> literally did it yesterday
[3:43:09] <%mMayrro> just buy the whole game
[3:43:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Don't even need a PS3 first
[3:43:19] <+Jasuchin> Demon Souls? limesPoggers
[3:43:19] <Drusain> can't buy demons souls anymore silly
[3:43:25] <%spiritofmojave> Cornyx sells bootleg Demon Souls PogChamp
[3:43:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> You can buy Bemon Souls in Dark souls?! thats meta
[3:43:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> Already bought demon souls. Doesn't hold up.
[3:43:30] <+aWanderingKaivo> cornflakes of the great swamp
[3:43:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Bemon Souls
[3:43:38] <+TheOneCalledRock> also fuck games being 70GB + now a days. COMPRESS YOUR GAMES
[3:43:45] <Goldninja_01> Just curious if your playing with the Curse of Attraction enabled, it spawns more mobs in each area. You can activate it at Firelink Shrine
[3:43:45] <+TheOneCalledRock> AAH
[3:43:47] <ShichiNoBushi> D-man Souls
[3:43:48] <+AppleBasket> awesome, it seems like Family Sharing got turned back on May 14th
[3:43:53] <+Jasuchin> 🅱️ emon Souls
[3:43:54] <+Lost_Zombie> gives tome doesn't check what it gives
[3:43:55] <%radiocrawler> I still adore the atmosphere in Demons Souls
[3:43:58] <%Emperor_Machinus> It's like playing Doom 1+2 in eternal. Demon souls in DS3
[3:43:59] <%mMayrro> @TheOneCalledRock psaBig Agree
[3:44:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TheOneCalledRock FINALLY SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS
[3:44:01] <%SvenHolgersson> compression is hardddddddd thooooouhhhh
[3:44:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> they had 5 years
[3:44:06] <%XeroSigmaPrime> when everyone in chat thinks of the same joke lopl
[3:44:08] <%Jekado> pat's character needs the kamidogu to complete his cosplay
[3:44:14] <davey0000> Dark Pyro's are the coolest dark spells tho
[3:44:15] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt What about dark pyromancies
[3:44:22] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Dark Pyro?
[3:44:22] <legacy0117> So that Dark sword spell btw is rad as hell.
[3:44:23] <ElenaManetta> "please don't be black...."
[3:44:23] <+Erimos> @Goldninja_01 it even adds in some cut enemies, I noticed. Fought some pilgrims near where Yoel is.
[3:44:29] <%Agami23> pat, why are you going full corrupted raiden?
[3:44:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Who needs compression when shiny graphic :) :) :)
[3:44:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> cmonBruh
[3:44:35] <+maynardftw> Okay I'm looking at the mod specs, and it says FP only refills automatically like that when you have a spell tool equipped in your hand
[3:44:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> Why the fuck is an ungly as game like destiny over 100Gigs!
[3:44:38] <%Taisuru> But what does she sell for gunslinger?
[3:44:39] <Zombrocom> Well, a bunch are from wolnir too
[3:44:45] <%YakumoYomi> @TheOneCalledRock EA and Activision seem like the worst at that. Fuck 100+ GB for a fucking COD game.
[3:44:48] <%WhereIsWill> my 1st playthru was a dark pyro. good times till the dlc
[3:44:49] <davey0000> FP refills no matter what
[3:44:50] <fuji_92> 🅱ark 🅱ouls 3 🅱inders 🅱od
[3:44:50] <ElenaManetta> your ball spell really makes yo look more
[3:44:51] <ElenaManetta> dbz-ish
[3:44:58] <%radiocrawler> Get ready for it folks.
[3:44:58] <%goose_attack_almanac> Is that how you get the Pass
[3:44:58] <davey0000> You don't need any spell casting stuff
[3:45:00] <+JVolfram> Dark Magician
[3:45:01] <Zombrocom> Affinity orbs are so cute
[3:45:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> nerd

[3:45:32] <+Snektor> time for a poundin
[3:45:32] <+Invlux> Bodied
[3:45:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> AND ANOTHER ONE
[3:45:34] <LSpiral> Pyromancies deal really good damage but the lack of range might not be so nice coming from sorceries
[3:45:37] <+AppleBasket> Affinity seems REALLY good as a precasted spell
[3:45:37] <+Snektor> or not
[3:45:40] <legacy0117> Only thing more dangerous than those are the sorcery versions.
[3:45:42] <davey0000> THis mod lets you play as the twink you always dreamed off
[3:45:43] <JackaxeAM> jesus
[3:45:44] <%radiocrawler> Nicely done

[3:45:53] <%weissguard> He's dead.
[3:45:54] <%radiocrawler> He scared the crap out of me earlier today.
[3:45:55] <leonelmarianog> It's really okay
[3:45:56] <%otakon17> ofc he swipes at it first
[3:45:57] <legacy0117> And whoa that was close.
[3:45:57] <%goose_attack_almanac> FUCK STAIRS HE LEAPIN

[3:47:00] <%Emperor_Machinus> it looks like a shiv
[3:47:01] <davey0000> So builds can get real fucking nutty

[3:47:07] <lordchum1150> Irythyll Greatsword?
[3:47:07] <BliVru> The gloves effect overrides every other effect. they dont stack
[3:47:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I thought there was Ice magic in the DLC as a pyromancy. Or did I dream that
[3:47:08] <%QuadraticGravity> click jump without sprinting
[3:47:11] <+AppleBasket> it allows for Easy
[3:47:18] <%otakon17> try jumping without sprinting

[3:47:53] <%otakon17> THIS WILL MAKE THE SWAMP A BREEZE
[3:47:56] <+Erimos> Still pretty eh. You're super vulnerable when you jump.
[3:47:56] <davey0000> That's the frost effect @XeroSigmaPrime
[3:47:56] <rekinom> Hey what if this sword gave you a jump button
[3:47:57] <Scrummo> is this an update I missed!? it's so cool!
[3:47:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Horder Pat
[3:47:58] <%Taisuru> [ Try Plunging Attack ]
[3:48:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @XeroSigmaPrime Ye, I think it's the game

[3:48:03] <%Order_of_Mystery> Clear your inventory you dingus
[3:48:04] <%spiritofmojave> @xerosigmaprime Ambiance is goin nuts
[3:48:04] <Coystick> WHO'S HISSING?
[3:48:06] <Zombrocom> @Sphincter_Spelunker There was two ice spells in Ashes of Ariandel, sorceries
[3:48:08] <%SvenHolgersson> THEY ADDED A JUMP BUTTON
[3:48:08] <%bevyrage> can't you mark equipment as [favorites] in DS3?
[3:48:12] <+AppleBasket> why does Pat's sword glow so much?
[3:48:14] <%Zulrez> @PatStaresAt its the only one without a big ass red X nextr to it NotLikeThis
[3:48:14] <%SvenHolgersson> PRAISE THE SUN
[3:48:16] <%YakumoYomi> @XeroSigmaPrime Yeah, it's from the ice effect on the gloves, I think.
[3:48:16] <%XeroSigmaPrime> That Frost Effect noise is AWFUL
[3:48:16] <BlacSoul> irithyll great sword
[3:48:19] <waifoong98> @otakon17 swamp doesn't slow you down anymore I think in the mod
[3:48:21] <PRchris13> uniiPtq
[3:48:28] <%otakon17> @Scrummo it's a mod called Cinders that does a BUNCH of neat QoL changes
[3:48:29] <%moogleboy1984> I wasn't paying attention, are we talking about the dagger dash for the swamp?
[3:48:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Were the ice spells actual ice or crystal magic
[3:48:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> [don't give up , skeleton]
[3:48:35] <BliVru> IN THE BOSS ARENA TOO
[3:48:37] <+SinisterBroccoli> @AppleBasket His gloves give him ice buff
[3:48:37] <%otakon17> @waifoong98 this mod just gets better and better
[3:48:42] <lordchum1150> Irithyll greatsword Pat
[3:48:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> DS3 is a blur to me
[3:48:52] <%radiocrawler> You don’t need dagger dash for swamp. You can just walk/run though all water.
[3:48:57] <+aWanderingKaivo> I think it was just stuff like a mist that builds frost status
[3:49:01] <%Typhaeon> He got the greatsword from the corpse
[3:49:04] <BliVru> is kinda hard to see without torch
[3:49:04] <+TheOneCalledRock> it's amazing how adding a dedicated jump button increase the quality of a game by 1000% just look at BOTW OpieOP
[3:49:07] <Zombrocom> @Sphincter_Spelunker Real ice, did frostbite
[3:49:09] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> @patstaresat my b, shadows playing tricks on me
[3:49:12] <BliVru> in the the corner
[3:49:16] <+AppleBasket> ONE GUY
[3:49:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @otakon17 This mod honestly fixes most of my problems with DS3, it's great
[3:49:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> thanks @Zombrocom
[3:49:28] <davey0000> Yeah the frost noise is garbage

[3:49:39] <Baeltyr> oh shit what?
[3:49:44] <aubrea> no bonfire?
[3:49:44] <%radiocrawler> That giant bonfire is important. You gotta play with elevators if you die here.
[3:49:44] <Scrummo> Oh cool! Seems this one is worth getting. @otakon17
[3:49:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh, that's what that white noise was
[3:49:45] <%Fooguwu> frost noise hurts me

[3:50:56] <+aWanderingKaivo> watch out for Corvid19
[3:50:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh CoRvids. I misread that
[3:51:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> If you swallow your spit in the wrong way, or at the wrong time, coughing happens.
[3:51:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat how you gonna swallow Plague when you can't even swallow your own spit. Kappa
[3:51:06] <%Order_of_Mystery> don't forget about the phosphorescent pole, @PatStaresAt !
[3:51:07] <HeaviestDownpour> Can't tell when something is weak to dark when you one-shot them lol

[3:51:18] <%weissguard> @YakumoYomi This a Keef Crew reference?

[3:51:27] <%DappercatEsquire> try praying now you bird ass bitch
[3:51:30] <%YakumoYomi> @weissguard You know it.
[3:51:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> Remember, Pat: Spitters are Quitters
[3:51:38] <gslayer14> always had fire
[3:51:40] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt They always had fire
[3:51:41] <%spiritofmojave> that's not new
[3:51:46] <HeaviestDownpour> Fire was there before
[3:51:49] <fuji_92> always had it
[3:51:50] <lordchum1150> I bet the irithyll greatsword is a big irithyll longsword
[3:51:51] <$lotharrio> Poison and Fire always went hand in hand, Pat.
[3:51:52] <%bevyrage> psa3guy
[3:51:53] <%weissguard> @YakumoYomi psaUp psaUp psaUp psaUp psaUp His evo 2020 vid is hilarious.
[3:51:53] <+twohitgood> makes sense. poison is a pyromancy.

[3:52:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> @TheOneCalledRock But if you're dealing with poison, call poison control for purging instructions
[3:52:41] <%moogleboy1984> la petite morte
[3:52:42] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt In case you didn't know, if you find any weapons that are also capable of casting spells (like Blue Flame), infusing it changes the type of spell it casts
[3:52:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> so Paige is making dinner for breakfast at midnight?
[3:52:55] <%DappercatEsquire> fuck that is faaaaaar

[3:53:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yep
[3:53:20] <%radiocrawler> Nailed it
[3:53:20] <Baeltyr> yes Pat
[3:53:21] <%walternatorz> the highest of brows
[3:53:24] <+Kataiser> Yes, infusing it Fire lets it cast pyromancies.
[3:53:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> @theonecalledrock Absolutely not.
[3:53:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> I much prefer Bard-ing, myself. Or theiving
[3:53:26] <Coystick> Help my sword cummies
[3:53:26] <$lotharrio> So like infusing it with Lightning makes it a Miracle Caster?
[3:53:29] <+Kataiser> Or Holy for miracles
[3:53:33] <fuji_92> yep cock magic
[3:53:33] <gslayer14> damn
[3:53:34] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Infusing Blue Flame with Lightning gives it Faith-based spell scaling and lets it cast miracles, for example
[3:53:39] <Aoworth> Babe! It's 4PM! Time for your dick infusion
[3:53:39] <$lotharrio> Neat.
[3:53:41] <%QuadraticGravity> givine it Fire would make it cast pyro
[3:53:48] <%spiritofmojave> @theonecalledrock hope that's a possible hypothetical question, but no D:
[3:53:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> eat any men out, Mildred
[3:53:57] <+Kataiser> The Cleric's Candlestick is bonkers because it lets you cast any spell in the game with whatever scaling type you want.

[3:54:24] <%Niney_Who> Yep
[3:54:29] <%DedlokPM> I like how in the RoosterTeeth stream @PatStaresAt and Woolie set the tone right away by immediately starting with the Chokejerk talk. woolieYE
[3:54:32] <HeaviestDownpour> Absolutely destroyed
[3:54:34] <Shadope342> vigor mage lets go
[3:54:35] <%Order_of_Mystery> Oh yeah, the cleric's candlestick is legit GOOD now
[3:54:39] <Zombrocom> Literally what he said
[3:54:43] <+Erimos> The infusion determines the scaling, I assume?
[3:54:44] <%Order_of_Mystery> like really good. in fact, get it!
[3:54:45] <+Kataiser> Example: Lightning-infused Cleric's Candlestick scales with Faith, but can cast all three schools of magic with that scaling.
[3:54:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @DedlokPM did they keep the N Pass talk in there?
[3:54:52] <%Daniel_Is_I> It's only for weapons that can also cast spells, like Cleric's Candlestick, Blue Flame, etc.
[3:54:54] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Capta1n_H3nry subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Happy May! Hope the goblin household is doing well. I'm personally a little bummed that Destiny is in such a low spot but thankfully PSO2 and Cyberpunk can take up most of my time while it hopefully recovers. P.S. What 40k species would you and Paige be?
[3:54:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> @theonecalledrock The best thing you can do in most cases is keep your heart rate as low as possible and contact poison control.
[3:54:58] <%Order_of_Mystery> what Kat said
[3:55:04] <+aWanderingKaivo> I thought the infusion limits it to the spell type of the infusion
[3:55:05] <%radiocrawler> Please put some weapons away while you’re here
[3:55:17] <ElenaManetta> mango is so yummy
[3:55:19] <ElenaManetta> i got mango what i miss
[3:55:20] <legacy0117> You need high faith though I think.
[3:55:32] <%bevyrage> @PatStaresAt you mentioned a few minutes ago that you were gonna stash some weapons away and haven't done so at the current opportunity

[4:02:23] <%otakon17> it's up there with Looney Toons in terms of comedy
[4:02:27] <%spiritofmojave> Chowder was amazing
[4:02:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> @starotter70 SoFarFetched

[4:02:53] <+maynardftw> I looked up the mod, and it's only available on nexusmods, which is normally fine, but this one's 2.2gb, and I'm on a free nexusmods account, so it's gonna be a bit since they cap the data speeds.
[4:02:59] <%otakon17> SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!
[4:03:00] <%spiritofmojave> Well Elmo gets to consoom all of us

[4:03:14] <%otakon17> The Almighty Elmo
[4:03:15] <%otakon17> not yet
[4:03:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> They should just put a go-pro on Elmo and stream that.
[4:03:19] <%YakumoYomi> I would totally eat @SoFarFetched . I bet she tastes delicious.
[4:03:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm sure that won't go wrong at all.
[4:03:29] <%otakon17> @CommanderSqueaks it would never move
[4:03:36] <@SoFarFetched> Please don't eat the mods psaPorgmo
[4:03:36] <%spiritofmojave> hey I'd watch that

[4:15:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> @vectorless_peon You can't use beef stock with duck you savage. Need a good mint sauce.
[4:15:50] <tuesti> @CommanderSqueaks paige baby talked him and he's that meme of that guy from the Office whispering "don't"

[4:16:13] <Broand> Are you talking about Giant/Giantess or the other kind of vore
[4:16:24] <@thenefftw> That was Pat and Paige doing it organically
[4:16:25] <+Promessa_EX> smaller girl eats larger man
[4:16:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> kettle, meet pot
[4:16:38] <xxshadowxx416> what do you thing pat taste like
[4:16:40] <%s_xylocalsingles> This just in Twitch Chat. SoFarFetched likes to sleep Naked
[4:16:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Organic fake orgasms."
[4:17:06] <%starotter70> Pat tastes like old people
[4:17:08] <Broand> pat tastes like energy drink marinade
[4:17:16] <tuesti> pat leaves and chat abuses mods
[4:17:22] <@SoFarFetched> Pat sleeps naked too
[4:17:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat tastes like monster and pleather, let's be honest.
[4:17:24] <@SoFarFetched> let that orb hang out
[4:17:25] <%StaceMcGate> Why lewd Fetched?
[4:17:30] <katocrimson> psaCanada psaCanada psaCanada
[4:17:34] <%vectorless_peon> Fuck yopur right @CommanderSqueaks
[4:17:39] <Broand> But the question is
[4:17:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> I used to sleep naked until I woke up by accidentally squishing my own nuts, that was a bad night.
[4:17:43] <@SoFarFetched> "Pats away,lewd the mods"
[4:17:45] <+Promessa_EX> naked is the only way, unless you have a comfy clothe on and don't wanna take them off
[4:17:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @StaceMcGate one guy brought up who should we eat while Pat and Paige eat
[4:17:48] <%starotter70> @StaceMcGate Chat has to lewd SOMEBODY
[4:17:50] <%maenos2> pat eats chowder which he belives gives him sexual powers
[4:17:54] <Broand> does pat taste like a sofa? or does the sofa taste of pat?
[4:18:03] <%vectorless_peon> just eat the mods, no lewding
[4:18:05] <Broand> we may never know
[4:18:12] <+Promessa_EX> pat's couch has so much human slime i bet omg
[4:18:13] <ElenaManetta> pat's eating paige's cum soup, the stream is already bursting with sexual energy
[4:18:16] <%terminallyCapriciousz> the sofa sure SMELLs like pat
[4:18:17] <tuesti> but if someone breaks into your house and you're naked now what
[4:18:24] <%StaceMcGate> I think can lewd something better than a duck with a leek
[4:18:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tuesti What would you do if you broke into someone's house and they came out butt ass naked?
[4:18:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> rule34
[4:18:41] <%starotter70> @tuesti Eat them so no one knows
[4:18:45] <tuesti> @CommanderSqueaks touche
[4:18:46] <%Clundy> Have you ever farted and then looked directly into the camera only to say “uhoh” and put your stream on hold for an extended period of time to empty the cracked floodgate that is your anus?
[4:18:49] <+Promessa_EX> naked man with gun still ma n with gun
[4:18:51] <%vectorless_peon> damn right @StaceMcGate
[4:18:55] <legacy0117> I'm glad I avoid the vore. Certain things I can understand, but not eating another living thing like a snake. Kinda doesn't sound pleasant.
[4:18:56] <%SirGO0SE> it's just like my favorite doujin
[4:19:03] <+aspirationdeath> reading virgins try to lewd is the most unsexy thing i can think of
[4:19:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> @aspirationdeath Yeah, I know right? Why do you keep trying to lewd.
[4:19:19] <skyentombment> hey guys, is pat shitting again?
[4:19:24] <%StaceMcGate> I can't believe everyone is horny on PSA
[4:19:25] <tuesti> @starotter70 eat them so nobody finds out they were naked? save them the embarassment of being murdered naked?
[4:19:26] <xxshadowxx416> so really old jerky yak
[4:19:30] <%s_xylocalsingles> did u shit urself

[4:40:08] <%toolofparanoia> its enough to make a man sick
[4:40:10] <%Niney_Who> what
[4:40:14] <@SoFarFetched> Cause it would be 100+ more hours of P5R streams,and would take so long to get to new content.
[4:40:14] <%SirGO0SE> no more p5r because you didn't recommend it to 5 friends each
[4:40:17] <SGrim> @Ninestempest Pat called Atlus to confess so he had an excuse to play more Dark Souls
[4:40:22] <%Ninestempest> fair
[4:40:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> A German Spy is playing P5R, go check him out.
[4:40:24] <%Niney_Who> Oh
[4:40:26] <@SoFarFetched> plus wasn't getting enough views with the P5R streams
[4:40:29] <worldbrand> do they drop the regular amount of souls when they die in addition to their boss soul?
[4:40:40] <Chimeraelite> yep
[4:40:40] <@SoFarFetched> since people tuned out of them cause they were either playing it themselves or didn't wanna watch

[4:44:24] <%spiritofmojave> Skeletons are dummies, and that's not ok :(
[4:44:27] <%QuadraticGravity> Fun Fact about this mod: Killing a boss without getting hit gets you materials to reinforce past the normal maximum.
[4:44:36] <+mecha_sniper_joe> Pat looks like a monkey
[4:44:36] <%WhereIsWill> pat use your influence powers to remaster demons souls
[4:44:40] <%PsycoZaku> so I'm still really confused about last boss fight
[4:44:44] <%starotter70> Oh shit
[4:44:49] <%PsycoZaku> did they increase armor values
[4:44:54] <Coystick> Super Slab God Super Slab
[4:44:54] <+xeros720> about a 15% increase to damage
[4:44:58] <%PsycoZaku> or does rotted just do no damage now
[4:44:59] <%DappercatEsquire> cool sticks idiots
[4:45:04] <Calek> you can get the super materials in NG, but in NG+ you get them from special enemies
[4:45:05] <RetributionP> nah Demons souls remake
[4:45:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pencil Pusers PogChamp
[4:45:07] <%Mr_Pylon> So basically do each boss with Super Solaire for it?
[4:45:10] <%PsycoZaku> he was taking less damage than vanilla rotted
[4:45:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pushers
[4:45:12] <+Anri02> @spiritofmojave Are you saying they are....boneheads?
[4:45:15] <+ShadowArcangel> that's new
[4:45:16] <%QuadraticGravity> @PsycoZaku Rotted pretty much never did much damage if you had any sort of armor on.

[4:51:34] <%YakumoYomi> @thenefftw I don't know for sure, but the changes in how stat scaling works and the passive buffs for catalysts probably mean there's an argument to be made for using other staves.
[4:51:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 8 pm stream
[4:51:37] <%Ninestempest> in vanilla at least
[4:51:44] <%starotter70> It's like 3 pm in Pat time
[4:51:47] <@thenefftw> Thank god
[4:51:49] <%Ninestempest> it sucks pre-50
[4:52:09] <Scrub_Seeker> the insanity catalyst?
[4:52:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> to google
[4:52:12] <%Ninestempest> I totally forget, I'd have to look it up, haven't seen it since i did my mage build right after ringed city came out
[4:52:12] <OlavOlavsson> court sorcerer is only good after 50+ int
[4:52:16] <dinnydanny777> is the hexer's staff in the game
[4:52:20] <%DappercatEsquire> furious wiki-ing
[4:52:22] <+pswayde> pat go to bed
[4:52:22] <%Ninestempest> i think court yeah
[4:52:27] <lordchum1150> Chat: Potato chips with ridges or without
[4:52:32] <@thenefftw> I can look it up
[4:52:32] <%Ninestempest> without
[4:52:35] <KingyoNingyo> without please
[4:52:35] <+Erimos> Insanity catalyst looks busted.
[4:52:37] <%dekkitout> Ridges fo da bitchez
[4:52:37] <%PsycoZaku> ridges
[4:52:39] <%WhereIsWill> this build looks like it rocks due to the changes
[4:52:41] <@SoFarFetched> ridges
[4:52:42] <+ekodrop> is it paige?
[4:52:45] <%SirGO0SE> surprise me
[4:52:46] <%PsycoZaku> cause the chips are thicker
[4:52:48] <%QuadraticGravity> hes just walkin around now
[4:52:50] <RetributionP> Paige?
[4:52:51] <$lotharrio> @lordchum1150 Depends. With dip, you want ridges. If you're just after a snack, then without.
[4:52:51] <KingyoNingyo> shit yeah tree swamp
[4:52:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> With ridges or without? My answer is yes
[4:52:59] <%Atomik456> ridges, especially if there's dip
[4:53:01] <@thenefftw> Ah, yeah it is
[4:53:10] <Zombrocom> There are several, Manus catalyst, murky longstaff, insanity catalyst
[4:53:12] <%Ninestempest> yes it is court sourcerer
[4:53:15] <%Ninestempest> optimal at 60 int
[4:53:23] <%Ninestempest> nearly all otehr staffs stop at 40
[4:53:23] <@thenefftw> Still, you're way over the soft cap at that point
[4:53:23] <dinnydanny777> Are these guys crabs insects or turtles
[4:53:25] <Zombrocom> Same scaling, different skills
[4:53:29] <%emperordread> Ridges are good because more surface area = more salt stuck to the chip
[4:53:31] <%FacetiousAF> bless
[4:53:32] <OlavOlavsson> @PatStaresAt Tried curse of attraction for maximum funsies?
[4:53:33] <Nelsukako> what is your favorite and least favorite DS game pat ? Kill me if you want, but i really like DS2 and 1, but think 3 is pretty boring
[4:53:35] <dalishprince> bless
[4:53:36] <$lotharrio> That said, when you're down to chip detritus, ridges give you better fistfuls of food.
[4:53:36] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> bleeds u Paige
[4:53:38] <+Snektor> did someone sneeze?
[4:53:38] <KeystoneA2> geshunteit
[4:53:39] <%trustycoyote> Bless you, paige
[4:53:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> who's sneezing
[4:53:45] <%YakumoYomi> Would it still be the best for Pat's build, due to the faith requirement for Dark magic?
[4:53:50] <%Niney_Who> Did you just get a HAT
[4:53:52] <@thenefftw> Oh, seriously
[4:53:53] <%Atomik456> mushroom hat!?
[4:53:57] <%Ninestempest> so int/faith no longer have a cap?
[4:53:58] <Zombrocom> No soft caps for Int Faith Str and Dex, everything else still has em
[4:54:01] <+Erimos> Shroom boi hat
[4:54:01] <Calek> soft caps for Vigor and Endurance still I believe
[4:54:01] <@thenefftw> No soft cap sounds great
[4:54:03] <KingyoNingyo> please pet The Baby for me when you see him next
[4:54:12] <%Niney_Who> YEAHHH
[4:54:14] <%DappercatEsquire> Wide open areas in Dark Souls games made me the most uncomfortable
[4:54:15] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[4:54:16] <$lotharrio> ...huh
[4:54:17] <+Erimos> 250 poison resist on the hat.
[4:54:18] <%Ninestempest> so basically court mage's staff always? or did everything's scaling get adjusted
[4:54:24] <Cigwynn> That fuckin' hat, OMG
[4:54:36] <Zombrocom> @Ninestempest Every catalyst got adjusted
[4:54:40] <$lotharrio> There's a black knight and some sort of swamp beats out there.
[4:54:41] <%Ninestempest> cooooool
[4:54:41] <%QuadraticGravity> The cap removal is fun. Level 70 Samurai with a +7 Black Blade right now. I've got like 70 Dex and it's still scaling.
[4:54:44] <OlavOlavsson> IIRC there was a stronger pure int staff in Cinders
[4:54:45] <%Taisuru> Taisuru subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! If you had a dog would he be a good boi-vin?
[4:54:49] <%Emperor_Machinus> That monster was in you all along
[4:54:51] <%BlitzNeidhart> There's always horrid monsters around you're not finding
[4:54:52] <%Niney_Who> oh my god they added the pokey stick
[4:54:53] <dinnydanny777> It sounds like a Bloodborne enemy

[5:00:08] <%QuadraticGravity> playing on the player's original expectations is fun
[5:00:14] <%FacetiousAF> the games easier until the really fuckin hard parts
[5:00:16] <OlavOlavsson> Those dudes know how to use ladders in vanilla too, had it happen to me
[5:00:18] <RushUnplugged> it's only funny because Pat dies, it's not actually funny

[5:22:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Jokes on you, I already backed it up on a USB."
[5:22:10] <arkv01> research DEEZ NUTZ
[5:22:12] <%WhereIsWill> muh scrolls!
[5:22:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> those were counterfeit n passes
[5:22:21] <dinnydanny777> Guarantee they weren't scrolls
[5:22:30] <TurtlesAndTentacles> thanks for going so late Pat. I really like watching you play Souls games
[5:22:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, that was actually his toilet paper, he hoarding.
[5:22:38] <%blaggablag> That's his toilet paper hoard
[5:22:42] <%terminallyCapriciousz> No! the ancient jedi texts!
[5:22:49] <@thenefftw> Okay, so what's the deal with the fast FP regen? Is that a ring he has equipped?
[5:22:51] <%DappercatEsquire> Reusable, washable toilet cloths
[5:23:03] <%blaggablag> The ancient butt cloths!
[5:23:03] <Zombrocom> @thenefftw It's part of the mod
[5:23:04] <%dekkitout> Spell casters get fp regen buff
[5:23:10] <%PsycoZaku> coincidentally I just started a dark build on normal ds3 and ds1re
[5:23:11] <dinnydanny777> Sage might actually be super difficult
[5:23:15] <@thenefftw> That's fucking incredible
[5:23:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> wack
[5:23:20] <arkv01> 5% POGGIES
[5:23:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> So 50 seconds to full FP, what the fuck.
[5:23:30] <%PsycoZaku> ds1re was easier cause I figured out how to dupe crunchy souls to 999
[5:23:32] <OlavOlavsson> You can boost fp regen even further, it becomes crazy
[5:23:32] <dinnydanny777> If Sage got new spells he's probably super tough
[5:23:33] <+sharokk> this really makes me want to play through ds3 again
[5:23:34] <Aydarkzero> two staffs PogChamp
[5:23:36] <%blaggablag> Dude was just chilling
[5:23:38] <@SoFarFetched> think it was actually 22 seconds
[5:23:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> @sofarfetched It is
[5:23:45] <+sharokk> is this mod a pain to install or simple
[5:23:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> @sofarfetched I'm dumb
[5:23:46] <%DappercatEsquire> That guy was just having a think
[5:23:48] <ShichiNoBushi> That guy was just It and was counting the time for his friends to hide.
[5:23:50] <arkv01> ok thats pretty sick
[5:23:52] <%terminallyCapriciousz> pat got it to 22 seconds
[5:23:52] <darwood_> math
[5:23:54] <%Bane_Kaikyo> oh it scales Attunement?... that way non-mages don't regen as fast
[5:23:55] <Chimeraelite> Play the game how you want is my fav way to play the game. SUPER easy to install
[5:23:55] <OlavOlavsson> @sharokk Drag and drop
[5:24:04] <+ShadowArcangel> some spells like heal make it so it takes a while before fp starts to regen though
[5:24:06] <+Erimos> More like 20 seconds, Jesus...
[5:24:06] <darwood_> jesus christ
[5:24:08] <+sharokk> @OlavOlavsson cool, thanks
[5:24:09] <Zombrocom> and your sword
[5:24:14] <%dekkitout> Can it get even faster tho? 👀
[5:24:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> @erimos Shut up I'm drunk.
[5:24:19] <+OopsyDoops> OopsyDoops subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:24:31] <Aydarkzero> any idea what to enchant the staff with? or are you looking for a better staff?
[5:24:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no you're @CommanderSqueaks

[5:24:48] <%starotter70> psaGib
[5:24:50] <%DappercatEsquire> CRAB HELM CRAB HELM
[5:24:50] <+Ryallen> I feel like this brings up a decent case for why Dark Souls games should be easier, since this looks a lot more fun than base DkS3 while also being a good deal easier as well
[5:24:52] <%Bane_Kaikyo> C R A B
[5:24:54] <%terminallyCapriciousz> hi drunk im clown
[5:24:55] <dinnydanny777> Crab helm is ultimate armour
[5:24:58] <+Erimos> @CommanderSqueaks I wasn't correcting you, I was just surprised. No offense to you.
[5:25:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> I appreciate that Pat took my completely wrong calculation at face value, though.
[5:25:04] <+Ryallen> Not that I think Soulsborne games should be easier or have a difficulty setting
[5:25:04] <Tiewolf> give us..... The crab!
[5:25:05] <%dekkitout> This mod makes the game harder tho
[5:25:07] <mostundesired> Wait, hold on. That ring means you can now parry and quickstep with the same weapon. We bloodborne now.
[5:25:07] <%Bane_Kaikyo> S H O W C R A B
[5:25:11] <dinnydanny777> How do you fight an enemy who wears a crab helmet
[5:25:14] <tolloponik> Christ I forgot about that NPC
[5:25:16] <OlavOlavsson> The game balances out the fp regen by making stronger spells eat a fuckton of fp
[5:25:21] <%blaggablag> Become as crab
[5:25:22] <%THATGUY_789> Why is Pat Raide
[5:25:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> is Paige still there

[5:26:20] <%Bane_Kaikyo> C R A A A A B UH
[5:26:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dappercatesquire They're cool until you're the only asshole kid wearing them at Summer camp while everyone's trying to go starwatching. You know what fucks up night vision? A flashing light everytime some idiot kid takes a step.
[5:26:55] <%Decoyhound> do you plan on using mooonlight greatsword later? or the spell thereof
[5:26:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> blind girl is in hub. saved is subjective
[5:26:59] <dinnydanny777> Clandestine coat looks familiar to me for some reason
[5:27:03] <%blaggablag> Now, Elmo, that cat has p o i s e

[5:27:38] <@SoFarFetched> he looks so proud
[5:27:43] <%DappercatEsquire> @CommanderSqueaks That would put a damper on things. Did scientists ever get around to light up sketchers w/ wheels or are they still doing nothing?
[5:27:48] <Scrub_Seeker> "unholy remnants", you'll get it at wolnir
[5:27:48] <@thenefftw> Look at that good baby

[5:28:50] <%THATGUY_789> Elmo seeks the comfort spot
[5:28:52] <%Emperor_Machinus> Crab helm though?
[5:28:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat should go all Crab build.
[5:28:56] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt I think rings that boost sorceries still work with dark sorceries, but that ring specifically boosts all "hex" stuff.
[5:28:59] <blackjackskellington> You’re bacony pat
[5:29:01] <dinnydanny777> Darkness is the heart's true essence after all

[5:29:29] <Zombrocom> He has 40% resist to all magic
[5:29:31] <LSpiral> pat going into a boss fight with 36k souls seems a bit ballsey for this stage of the game
[5:29:33] <%WhereIsWill> MAGIC BATTLE!!
[5:29:35] <+Ryallen> I think he might have high magic resist
[5:29:35] <OlavOlavsson> Sorcery ring dont boost Dark sorceries

[5:30:05] <+Ryallen> I had so much trouble with this fight when I first did it
[5:30:05] <%vectorless_peon> a deepnut might be good seasoning for Farfetched
[5:30:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> I was thinking this was going to be a fight, but then I remembered that Pat has 7 Estus Flask charges.
[5:30:07] <%PsycoZaku> two dudes standing right next to each other slashing away and doing no damage
[5:30:13] <SGrim> He's called the Crystal Sage because he loves meth.

[5:30:25] <Zombrocom> Crystal sage is a pretty easy boss anyway
[5:30:28] <%Decoyhound> crystal mage is actually a decent fight without big bonk build
[5:30:30] <%dekkitout> There is some strong affinity for vore tonight
[5:30:36] <dinnydanny777> He's called the crystal sage because he believes crystals cure disease

[5:40:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> LUL
[5:40:14] <%YakumoYomi> @FirearmsInstructor Yeah, that's Dark Edge. It was changed in this mod, as it used to be this really slow vertical swing
[5:40:16] <+sleepers1mulant> bident is just spear of longinus
[5:40:17] <%Panquake25> So is Abyssal Titanite just an RNG drop from all enemies?
[5:40:18] <@thenefftw> So would a spear be called a unident?
[5:40:21] <%PsycoZaku> @0rond it's been called that since then

[5:40:47] <All_Salt> cheer500 Hey Pat, I was wondering. Since RPG's can vary wildly between how the game plays and how much influence you have in their stories, what to you, makes a good ass rpg?
[5:40:54] <Aydarkzero> @dinnydanny777 he ate a SHIT ton of souls to become swole
[5:40:55] <%dekkitout> @dinnydanny777 Gaining power makes you big in Dark Souls
[5:40:56] <dinnydanny777> Dark Souls characters just double in size when they become bosses
[5:40:57] <%optimasmaximas> YEYEYE
[5:40:59] <Djinnazz> @dinnydanny777 Souls make you big.
[5:41:02] <@SoFarFetched> Kreygasm
[5:41:03] <FirearmsInstructor> @YakumoYomi ah I thought it looked semi-familiar from before. I don't watch much DS but I catch it occasionally. Makes sense.
[5:41:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> @commanderclaw Is it a problem tho? I am seriously asking. This game's lore is weird.
[5:41:13] <%Order_of_Mystery> Gael vored like 50 people and he got swole, then the world ended
[5:41:16] <dinnydanny777> "I'm a boss now so I guess I'm seven feet tall now"
[5:41:17] <mostundesired> Now go beat Friede.
[5:41:18] <+tigerfang86> Gael ate A LOT OF PEOPLE to get huge
[5:41:20] <@thenefftw> He really wants you to help him out

[5:44:13] <RushUnplugged> did they change it in cinders, becuase that's NOT how it works in 3, it's total scaling int/fth
[5:44:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> HOLD IT
[5:44:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> @zombrocom But it might work that way in this mod.
[5:44:16] <%weissguard> @FirearmsInstructor It's Geese Howard from King of Fighters.
[5:44:21] <Infeirno23> @zombrocom maybe the mod changed it
[5:44:23] <FirearmsInstructor> @Infeirno23 oh woof... so you need to have both balanced? :(
[5:44:27] <%SilvaChariot0133> The Geese is Leese

[5:46:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> 'Why are you a dick, dad?'
[5:46:15] <Aydarkzero> not sure if it's changed in Cinders but it says that it's determined by both Int & Faith but mostly Faith
[5:46:27] <dinnydanny777> Why does every person in Dark Souls want to fight you
[5:46:42] <FirearmsInstructor> @rumtumtugnutz sporkyNoU
[5:46:47] <Zombrocom> Cinders wiki says:Dark Sorceries, Dark Pyromancies and Dark Miracles scale equally with both Intelligence and Faith.

[5:46:54] <%dekkitout> The streets of Dark Souls City be rough

[5:47:11] <Aydarkzero> i can't believe Pat made a Naruto build
[5:47:11] <mostundesired> God damn it I forgot about those sticks LUL
[5:47:13] <%starotter70> Poruto Arc begins now
[5:47:19] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> that quarantine beard though
[5:47:22] <dinnydanny777> Pat made a Naruto cosplay
[5:47:27] <%dekkitout> Ball and stick = big ninja way woolieDATTEBAYO
[5:47:35] <FirearmsInstructor> @rumtumtugnutz uhhhhhhhhhh I'm not sure I want to know what that image is LUL (can't see it clearly)
[5:47:37] <Monkeyweed21> @mostundesired there's a reason they never come back
[5:47:40] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat should talk about Destiny 2.
[5:47:45] <%QuadraticGravity> usually the thing you're looking at is Spell Buff, not the spell itself
[5:47:46] <@commanderclaw> Go to the spells page
[5:47:48] <RushUnplugged> it scales with Spell Buff from your cast weapon, which scales off stats
[5:47:48] <Aydarkzero> @Neo_Kaiser next podcast for sure
[5:47:48] <%OopsyDoops> the Patsuke Retrieval Arc is now in motion
[5:47:55] <dinnydanny777> Magic is powered by the will of your heart, just follow your heart
[5:47:58] <%dekkitout> Can we not talk about Felwinter's Ball Fumble...
[5:48:00] <mostundesired> @Monkeyweed21 Because Kishi is a hack?
[5:48:15] <+dmtjinni> ELMO!
[5:48:21] <%heartlesshealer> psaWink
[5:48:24] <%starotter70> @OopsyDoops Pat pulls out a box cutter and scraps his headband
[5:48:29] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt Go to the "Spells" page, go to spell scaling
[5:48:32] <@commanderclaw> The Spell page says it scales with both
[5:48:34] <Aydarkzero> i dunno all i know is both my Int & Faith are 60
[5:48:35] <Monkeyweed21> @mostundesired that too but also they have nothing to do with Naruto's fighting style the whole series and come out of nowhere
[5:48:45] <Aydarkzero> maybe a better staff will fix it?
[5:48:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> @FirearmsInstructor It's the 3 guy, but flipped
[5:48:54] <%heartlesshealer> It sounds like it's on a spell by spell basis
[5:48:59] <mostundesired> @Monkeyweed21 That just sounds like "Kishi is a hack" with extra steps.

[5:49:08] <@commanderclaw> http://ds3-cinders.wikidot.com/spells
[5:49:14] <Zombrocom> Home > Game Mechanics > Spells, scroll down to spell scaling
[5:49:19] <dinnydanny777> What spell do you get if you just want to make everything explode
[5:49:21] <%QuadraticGravity> I was about to ask if I could post that, Claw got it lol
[5:49:24] <%trustycoyote> Yeah seems like the spells do a flat rate and equipment can buff it
[5:49:25] <Billyuppercut0> Damn I missed everything...
[5:49:32] <dinnydanny777> I want big visual effect
[5:49:41] <%OopsyDoops> kishi is almost on par with toriyama
[5:49:41] <FirearmsInstructor> @ElenaManetta idolmiPAT
[5:49:47] <+muramasa99> It scales with whichever is lower between Int and Faith. At least thats how it worked in 2.
[5:49:53] <Zombrocom> Pyros are strange
[5:50:03] <Aydarkzero> i remember Pyromancy scaling to both
[5:50:10] <Zombrocom> @muramasa99 DS3 scaling is different from DS2
[5:50:11] <%heartlesshealer> thanks for finding and posting the wiki @commanderclaw
[5:50:13] <dinnydanny777> Is magic useless like in Ds2?
[5:50:14] <FirearmsInstructor> @rumtumtugnutz ahhhhhhhhh yeah now I see it when I click and it's a bit bigger
[5:50:17] <%QuadraticGravity> Does your Heretic Staff actually have spell buff scaling?
[5:50:19] <Infeirno23> they say the equally scale but that might mean if they are equal?
[5:50:24] <RushUnplugged> forget that lower thing, it doesn't matter
[5:50:25] <%Caidezes> Don't the spells scale off weapons too? So upgrading the staff would help. Or getting a better staff.
[5:50:33] <Billyuppercut0> Is PyroMage a viable build?
[5:50:36] <Zombrocom> It does
[5:50:39] <%trustycoyote> @quadraticgravity yes
[5:50:40] <Aydarkzero> might be time for an upgrade
[5:50:44] <%PsycoZaku> @billyuppercut0 yes
[5:50:46] <%QuadraticGravity> Hmm.
[5:50:47] <dinnydanny777> Can you get the staff that spins from Dark Souls 2?
[5:50:55] <Aydarkzero> i think most builds are viable in Cinders mod
[5:51:03] <%QuadraticGravity> This is weird cause I was running Pyro earlier and those totally scaled properly.
[5:51:09] <%PsycoZaku> @billyuppercut0 it's basically a quality magic build 45 45 intfth
[5:51:09] <RushUnplugged> @PatStaresAt Spell Buff on weapons is what actually boosts spells, and that scales off casting stats

[6:02:17] <Aydarkzero> Kono Dio da!
