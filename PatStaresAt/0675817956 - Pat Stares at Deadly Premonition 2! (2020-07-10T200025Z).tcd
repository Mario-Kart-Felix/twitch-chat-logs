[0:38:02] <$RealThiele> warrior priest + alchemist
[0:38:04] <%Hammerknife> why is pat streaming so early in the day
[0:38:04] <%damienlunas> My favorite concept for Chemist is a Healer but with Mudras
[0:38:04] <%Bishop_Shidux> If you combined all of the states with a right angle in them west of the missouri river, it would be all of them, just one giant state from the river to the pacific ocean
[0:38:04] <Chaossheep> Wait what
[0:38:04] <%Frost_Quill> I want time mage as a TANK, and chemist as a healer.
[0:38:05] <%dinnydanny777> The infinite damage alchemy from FFX
[0:38:05] <BunnyEmperor> like old astro with different effects on heals / buffs?
[0:38:06] <Chaossheep> Chemist?
[0:38:06] <DiscoNinjaWolf> More mudras
[0:38:07] <PirateMike_> Did Pat say anything about Playing Persona 4 Golden?
[0:38:08] <+veraverse> Classy
[0:38:09] <+UberWolfman> first fix scholar and AST LUL
[0:38:14] <Drusain> you just want to throw bottles at people
[0:38:14] <+zabemareu> ninja mudras?
[0:38:15] <%Daniel_Is_I> Like you combo your way up to a big heal?
[0:38:16] <doggieo> Make it like NINJA
[0:38:16] <+TrashpandaOni> mudras for different heals
[0:38:18] <%RedKnightVI> Cool
[0:38:18] <%dinnydanny777> 9999999999999 damage
[0:38:21] <%heartlesshealer> That'd be fun

[0:38:30] <%Jumpie8> THE PICKLES
[0:38:30] <%zestyArsenic> Give Chemist a gap closure that smashes a potion on your face from 25 yalms
[0:38:32] <%worldbrand> Sounds like a recipe for salt
[0:38:37] <%Promessa_EX> i have my clam chowder
[0:38:40] <%cylish> Chemist full heal does a small amount of damage first from smashing the vial on the tank

[0:39:20] <Coystick> Quint II
[0:39:21] <BunnyEmperor> Yes
[0:39:21] <Psyramics> Chemist throws a potion that creates a puddle on the ground that increases damage and heals. That first bit is to make sure DPS stand in it
[0:39:22] <%Frost_Quill> @cylish Yes, chemist should cause damage from smashing glass in their face.
[0:39:22] <%Birdigalore> you can do it

[3:34:02] <+GrassCannon> If it dies, it dies
[3:34:03] <%coreyyotto> There are for sure memory leaks
[3:34:03] <%TigerCatGo> We're used to your mind globins

[3:34:22] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 34m.
[3:34:24] <%Stonebeard> Can you punch Patti and get fined $100?
[3:34:29] <+threamstream> I'm sure I'm not alone, but Deadly Premonition 1 was the first thing from best friends I watched. Now here we are watching the second game. I think that's pretty cool.
[3:34:29] <NEOFilly> its a part of the charm
[3:34:29] <+Anonymasque> Game could just shit the bed! But it's part of the charm.
[3:34:30] <%ringabal> Dammit I thought it said Evangelion
[3:34:31] <callsigneagle01> That thing on the right is the graveyard
[3:34:38] <callsigneagle01> Next to the church is the graveyard I mean
[3:34:44] <gabagoosh> collect some agent honor
[3:34:44] <+necrocannibal2> the
[3:34:48] <%albret__einstrong> @Stonebeard no
[3:34:49] <dabeaminator> Every now and then I have to remind myself that this game came out in 2020.
[3:34:50] <mesamus> uh i think you forgot to talk to the clarkson girl as she turned to see you after mumbling
[3:34:53] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt her house is on the map
[3:34:53] <%KaiserMario> I don't think Paige is doing her best, if she is... I pity the fool who'd marry such a lazy wench
[3:34:56] <%TheMattman1313> Patti is too smooth, shes liding
[3:34:58] <midsneak1> Yeah wheres the agent honor
[3:35:00] <Andrizzleton> how's the game chat? It is PURE shit? or pure SHIT?
[3:35:01] <%Scottigecko> what is this actually somewhat centralized map bullshit doing in my DP?
[3:35:02] <zmuno> @threamstream LuvSign
[3:35:03] <hardchunkz> yeah wheres my agent honor boi
[3:35:04] <+G_Thunders> So this game needed like... 2 more in development just to reach DP1’s level of jank, right? The map doesn’t even seem 1/10 the size and this jank is out of control
[3:35:09] <%ringabal> 10:30
[3:35:09] <%DashXero> Is there something wrong on my end, or is it the actual framerate of the game?
[3:35:09] <%Niney_Who> "8:30"
[3:35:11] <snakemuho> @threamstream it's still hard to accept that 2nd game even exists

[4:38:11] <Sunstalker> Xbox live indies though

[4:38:16] <%possumwalsh1221> It’s beautiful
[4:38:16] <+Sendrak70> Im still curious about why this is on the switch instead of the Xbox, ps4 or pc
[4:38:17] <%thegreenbenis> IT'S THE BEST
[4:38:17] <+rottingpastry> It's designed to be that way. We can try to mitigate it
[4:38:18] <+VioMariner> TWO MAFIA
[4:38:18] <KasiCrafter> It's CINIMATIC.
[4:38:18] <%dukenux> GTAIV when it released on pc first time

[4:40:54] <CursedNobleman> the sound designer needs a slap across the face
[4:40:57] <%NormalGuy> bee's arent even top 10
[4:40:58] <+Remery_> @PatStaresAt Is it the jankiest game you ever played?
[4:40:58] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> jank in a unique way
[4:40:59] <+nolifegamin> it's a different type of jank
[4:40:59] <DestroPrime83> New ways of jank being discovered
[4:41:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's a DIFFERENT kind of jank
[4:41:02] <+OwlLightningMage> It's the same tone and style but super different
[4:41:05] <%Pyroclase> It's new, exciting, different jank
[4:41:06] <%possumwalsh1221> It has a different tone yea
[4:41:07] <+MeatBomb> Jank is built into the budget.
[4:41:07] <+ElEversoris> alright I need to see how jank this shit is
[4:41:08] <+johnny_gogo> THAT GUY POPPED IN
[4:41:08] <BaslerJones> @PatStaresAt do you feel there is a really good game that is just crustified ?
[4:41:08] <%dinnydanny777> Truly a unique experience
[4:41:09] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt it's jank as fuck in new and exciting ways
[4:41:09] <%thegreenbenis> It's interesting jank.
[4:41:10] <ikantreeed> it looks worse thatn the 1st one
[4:41:12] <%Slimshazbot> They really innovated in the jank department
[4:41:15] <robbtre> The jank, the jank!
[4:41:17] <majindusto> We in Twin Peaks? lol
[4:41:18] <$jarednotwithsubway> ALL the jank
[4:41:18] <+ithonmage> how warm is your switch?
[4:41:18] <%Promessa_EX> this is no more heroes like
[4:41:21] <GearVoltron> Needs more jank tho
[4:41:22] <%feMC_is_best_girl> the frame rate is fine in buildings
[4:41:22] <+ElEversoris> oh this frame rate
[4:41:25] <astrofalcon1> the 360 us stronger than the switch Kappa
[4:41:26] <%ringabal> The Switch will do that
[4:41:27] <%Starotter70> I dunno, those Pickles
[4:41:29] <%unrolls> unrolls subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[4:41:38] <callsigneagle01> yeah Switch will do that
[4:41:39] <%bread_assassin> That's not a change for the better.
[4:41:41] <Bigyanno> This would legit give me a headache to play
[4:41:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat forgot about the pickles
[4:41:43] <%Promessa_EX> switch is actually 2x a 360
[4:41:43] <+Lunarhawk> @PatStaresAt I'm honestly shocked you havent crashed or soft locked yet. I had both happen by this amount of game time earlier
[4:41:45] <atomicxdj> Pickle Stone?
[4:41:45] <%ringabal> You ate a lot.
[4:41:47] <Gutsandlove> it was consistent

[4:42:01] <%silverira> yeah and 8 frames walk

[5:00:36] <Sartastic> bees sleep
[5:00:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> Maybe the bees being hard to find are a commentary on the fact that bees are disappearing at an alarming rate?

[5:01:54] <NEOFilly> hey zach!!
[5:01:55] <lbrownthedestroyer> Is this a joke?
[5:01:58] <MattDemers> I feel like this game should just have a "jank" option slider that degrades the framerate and other random shit
[5:01:59] <thelonechris> SIck air
[5:01:59] <%tusk102> THERE IT IS

[5:02:25] <%maenos2> I swear it becomes harder and harder to hear York as he skateboards
[5:02:26] <DE777ON> heavy rain
[5:02:28] <+vwvwvwvwvvvw> Louisiana is actually low framerate IRL so this is accurate.
[5:02:30] <Herb_guy> Tony Hawk remake stands no chance
[5:02:31] <rylmtn> Moving at the speed of shat

[5:05:54] <%Pyroclase> Do you have reason to believe there are bees in this haunted graveyard?
[5:05:56] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt apparently you killed the thing that spawns the bees

[5:06:33] <MimicTongue> I don't usually notice framerates in anything but wow this is bad
[5:06:34] <+rottingpastry> No bees were actually visible, so no one knows you killed a bees

[5:07:48] <+Kaiser_Loar> In the trees there will be Bee hives. Do Not shoot them. Run up and the bees will come out. It is one kill for every swarm.
[5:07:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> Is this going to have the same mechanic as the first game where it becomes a hell town at midnight?
[5:07:50] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt they thought swery was showing them a powerpoint for the game just to realize with horror it was the actual game
[5:07:50] <%dinnydanny777> WOAH AN ACTUAL CAR

[5:08:22] <lord_campbell96> Has this been just as "good" like the first one?
[5:08:25] <%ClericOfSparda> I've seen powerpoint presentations smoother than this.
[5:08:32] <Quizzeh_> VioMariner yes LUL
[5:08:33] <DE777ON> someone should petition tommy weiseau as a dlc for this game
[5:08:36] <+rottingpastry> Depends on the side quest
[5:08:36] <+ithonmage> There's a hive
[5:08:37] <%M3djedx> Oh man the remaster of tony hawk looks jank

[5:08:41] <Jack8274> OH just wait Pat, Main quests don't appear
[5:08:41] <%DashXero> It's okay, Pat. It's just the goblins.
[5:08:41] <%Pyroclase> maybe you go go complete a mission in a hidden ghost tunnel for unliimited money
[5:08:42] <Bigyanno> The first game is funny bad. This is just BAD
[5:08:43] <+ShinBojangles> I just got a red bull ad
[5:08:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Apparently there's bee hives in the trees, you have to run up to the hives and NOT shoot them.
[5:08:45] <%Promessa_EX> @lord_campbell96 it honestly seems really compelling
[5:08:46] <%Wallabri> just sleep in the park it's fine
[5:08:48] <snakemuho> @lord_campbell96 in terms of good characters and dialogue yes, in terms of jank also yes
[5:08:48] <penitentpentwitch> It looks like Breadcrumbs have to be found in person, but once started they show up in red.
[5:08:53] <+CourageTheCat> this game looks like it's over ten years old, I love it
[5:08:55] <weirdducks> just got here and wow it legit looks like someone just grabbed this off the mobile store love it

[5:22:08] <Herb_guy> you're going to walk funny once you walk around in the world after this

[5:23:06] <%InvisibleMan101> no DP here we only tolerate deadly P
[5:23:13] <%Promessa_EX> i can't stand my local radio. Masks now cause permanent heart damage
[5:23:15] <bloodyheartland> was anita sarkeesian involved in DP2?

[5:23:41] <%MaddyCaddy> Coco is cute

[5:26:00] <%SomersaultJustice> "milk"
[5:26:07] <%MaddyCaddy> VTMB 2 don't look great
[5:26:12] <+Rolandknight> Wait is D4 finally getting more content?

[5:28:23] <%Livelinne> serfYikes
[5:28:32] <%SirGO0SE> its almost like averaging reviews based on numbers that everyone looks at differently is a really stupid idea
[5:28:33] <%heartlesshealer> oh, the tumblr post
[5:28:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> I think some of them are real but not likely, especially not in a small area
[5:28:37] <Draco_Renegade> I heard that story was fake.
[5:28:38] <+LandOfTheWay> YOU DON
[5:28:39] <%ClericOfSparda> You need a Kermit emote
[5:28:40] <Fro5tburn> monkaS
[5:28:42] <%Nupinoop296> i know hat post
[5:28:44] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @PatStaresAt If the Pause screen is the Red Room, and Present day Zach is afraid of the color red.... Has Zack not paused his game in 15 years?
[5:28:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> *all together in a small area
[5:28:57] <+rottingpastry> Numerical review scores are dumb and should die subscribe to my newsletter
[5:28:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Monkeyweed21 Negative reviews had a less then 3% repeat

[5:29:45] <%ringabal> See: Pat
[5:29:48] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[5:29:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> that's true
[5:29:51] <%Mr_Pylon> He's doing professional cosplay
[5:29:52] <callsigneagle01> They mention David in the game
[5:29:53] <%Promessa_EX> I think he is D
[5:29:53] <callsigneagle01> I think
[5:29:55] <callsigneagle01> iirc
[5:30:01] <%za7az> dPat, he's a bit more than weird....
[5:30:02] <$jarednotwithsubway> he is right
[5:30:08] <+jiggy_snipe> watch there be triplets or something
[5:30:08] <%Monkeyweed21> @doc_ock_rokc not talking about any game specifically, just that its stupid easy for 1 guy to set up a copy-paste review bot and i've seen it go both ways
[5:30:09] <T_Sasquatch> Nahhh that's a mental illness . No one is that crazy for the lols
[5:30:10] <%optimasmaximas> funny how swery's characters all have the name david :think:
[5:30:11] <%thegreenbenis> Spicy vibration is an amazing name
[5:30:13] <callsigneagle01> Doesn't York mention the D4 stuff at some point?
[5:30:18] <+LeroyOctopus> is stream over or just a break for subs?
[5:30:32] <callsigneagle01> @LeroyOctopus ending
