[0:00:56] <@SoFarFetched> you mean back to CLANGING
[0:00:56] <Fabpsi_> @luftraumm1 yea, refresh if you can't see it
[0:00:57] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> lol
[0:00:58] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Wait chat is saying you bashed Lincoln?
[0:01:01] <Gruhunchously> FOR HONOR! FOR MANDALORE!
[0:01:01] <%luftraumm1> what the hell is Lincoln
[0:01:03] <%Wurmspawn> Store Worz?
[0:01:04] <%bleugh> stor wor
[0:01:08] <@SoFarFetched> oh no the clanging is gone
[0:01:13] <Fabpsi_> oh, they stopped the fight!
[0:01:16] <Fabpsi_> who won?
[0:01:18] <+Goatllama> IS THIS MUHFUCKIN BERSERK REFERENCE
[0:01:28] <%twistingt0rt0ise> Are those guys falling asleep in the back?
[0:01:29] <Fabpsi_> i bet both are just dead ass on the ground
[0:01:38] <%Mrbaconator> rectum
[0:01:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt That's because you're dark side though. Because if you're lightside Kavar is like "I agreed with everything you did. But I was a master and I had commitments to the order."
[0:01:42] <ExpressNode> @monkeyweed21 People say it's like Persona 5-2 and like it.
[0:01:44] <%emperordread> hehehe rectum
[0:01:48] <+Seitine> The clanging was too much for Twitch.
[0:01:49] <%vaporousTippler> If the entire Jedi order went to war, they'd all break their code. So there'd be no Jedi left.
[0:01:52] <@commanderclaw> And then they would have found the Star Forge together and the whole order would be fucked and corrupted
[0:01:55] <Gruhunchously> I'm not sure about that, Revan fought the Mandos for years and it was pretty rough
[0:02:05] <jorniev> HE IS THE WORST ONE ON THE LIGHT SIDE TOO
[0:02:14] <Goodvibes99508> didnt work withy vader why would it work with reavn?
[0:02:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> They didn't find the star forge as a group.
[0:02:18] <Gruhunchously> All hypotheticals
[0:02:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> Revan and Malak found it alone.
[0:02:26] <%Maids4lyfe> The Order is already corrupt and fucked
[0:02:27] <ChungusQuest> They were bitches, basically
[0:02:28] <+Demirose41> true but if revan went crazy cuz of da war then these assholes would be giant dumb ass mustache twirling sith buttholes
[0:02:30] <%Monkeyweed21> They are much more reasonable if you are light side
[0:02:30] <%Wurmspawn> This is typical of Bioware convos though. Even when your character is actively TRYING to make sense to some npcs the npc will NEVER change their mind unless it's deliberately a plotpoint.
[0:02:39] <Gruhunchously> They found it after they had beaten the Mandalorians
[0:02:41] <%Knoster> Knoster subscribed with Prime. 
[0:02:43] <Fabpsi_> they would have eventually found it, but yea, i get your point
[0:02:56] <%Broken_Sonex> That's right, Pat
[0:02:59] <%rawrmeowxd> none of this is gonna matter when the covenant invades
[0:03:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah if the Jedi had joined the mandalorian wars there wouldn't have been a civil war.
[0:03:05] <Fabpsi_> true that
[0:03:13] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Wouldn't the Exile have defended Revan and killed them super hard tho
[0:03:22] <Fabpsi_> annnnd back to the KLING!
[0:03:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> No.
[0:03:24] <HeroToxiko> he down bad
[0:03:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> The exile wasn't even strong as a jedi.
[0:03:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Revan sought the forge out of desperation to win the war. He would not have needed to find it if the whole Jedi Order had fought
[0:03:34] <Schrozz> Bastila whooped him practically alone
[0:03:35] <+Demirose41> he weak to force
[0:03:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> The exile is only powerful now because they were there at Malachor.
[0:03:42] <Gruhunchously> He used the conversation to juice himself back up.
[0:03:46] <+Seitine> Oh no can the stream handle the clanging this time LUL
[0:03:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> They were a mediocre jedi at best.
[0:03:51] <Dragovus> The Queen and the General have some impressive stamina to keep going all this time
[0:03:58] <%AzureGale> *clank* *clang* *punch*
[0:04:03] <@SoFarFetched> wait they're just standing there in the back
[0:04:05] <@SoFarFetched> geefThink
[0:04:07] <@SoFarFetched> menacingly
[0:04:10] <Fabpsi_> @Dragovus and now they are just standing still at the back lol
[0:04:12] <+Demirose41> He is a bersker ALl melee no force defence
[0:04:15] <HeroToxiko> @Too_Much_Nukie shook ones part 2 but make it star wars
[0:04:16] <T_Sasquatch> OOF
[0:04:19] <Gruhunchously> Because the darkness will eventually fall before the light
[0:04:25] <@SoFarFetched> LIGHTSABER WHY YOU LOUD
[0:04:31] <Fabpsi_> * angry lightsaber noises * what kreia? WHAT

[0:04:42] <%logoth_> BREERRROOOOWWWWWWWW
[0:04:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> This part of the game is fine Pat. It's just an illusion in the force.
[0:04:49] <T_Sasquatch> Lightsabers are louder than you think
[0:04:53] <+Seitine> Those are important lightsaber noises tho
[0:04:58] <Goodvibes99508> man i wish they would remaster these games
[0:04:58] <BoneofMalkav> "WHAT?!" "I can't hear you! Let's talk in my office!" LUL

[0:06:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> She just saw you defeat a jedi master.
[0:06:49] <%SomersaultJustice> oh no I've fallen easily!
[0:06:55] <%QueequegTheater> She's fucking tougher than kavarr
[0:06:58] <HeroToxiko> i guess she wasn't kidding LUL

[0:11:21] <saraizarai> You'll get your things after the revolution is over
