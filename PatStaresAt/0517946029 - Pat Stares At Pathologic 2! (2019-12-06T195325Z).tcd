[0:02:01] <Naoyin> oh hell yeah this game
[0:02:09] <niddron> I mean I'm fine with weird russian surrealism the game
[0:02:09] <+ennui_on_me> I'm super down to see Pat play it
[0:02:12] <jerseyfoxarcade> Never thought I’d see Pat play this game.
[0:02:16] <KoryMccool> Oh christ hes actually doing it
[0:02:19] <%CappuccinoGuil> SUP CHAT
[0:02:20] <mr_gunn> Pat finished all the games
[0:02:20] <jimmypurple> Howdy folks!

[0:02:35] <%theburnedoutnerd> apatDab apatDab
[0:02:36] <%CappuccinoGuil> Chat, I just played a dope game today. It's DMC + Doom
[0:02:36] <%BestTeaMaker> pat wait it's warframe dev stream
[0:02:38] <niddron> is this death stranding 2?
[0:02:41] <+DesertPenguin> Did anyone get the Campbells Chicken Soup E-Sports ad? That was hilarious
[0:02:42] <Ninjagregory98> Guys help I’m getting a hungry box Campbell’s soup ad
[0:02:42] <+ennui_on_me> I remember when it was being crowdfunded the podcast was like "oh cool, Pathologic. What's Pathologic?"
[0:02:43] <mr_gunn> If only he would play another game that ends in 2
[0:02:43] <%MaddyCaddy> apatDab sipsipDab
[0:02:44] <%Bailey__gaming> Hi Eveyrone, what's a pathalogic?
[0:02:53] <%MaddyCaddy> A not game
[0:02:58] <britishtrex> Honestly this game is so interesting after hbomb and mandalore covered it.
[0:02:59] <darcfowler1995> We innnnnnnnnn sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[0:02:59] <+ennui_on_me> Pathologic is a weird obtuse Twin Peaks game
[0:03:01] <mr_gunn> Dav
[0:03:05] <mr_gunn> Dab
[0:03:05] <%Alpha8087> I cant wait to see this
[0:03:06] <%Bailey__gaming> Hope Peach is feeling a bit better today!
[0:03:09] <+DesertPenguin> It's a 2005 role playing survival game
[0:03:12] <%theburnedoutnerd> hbomb made me hype for it
[0:03:17] <robo_badger> A very difficult , weird game
[0:03:18] <%theburnedoutnerd> but never want to play it
[0:03:24] <%MaddyCaddy> I hope Pat doesn't get frustrated, because the story is really good, but the gameplay is awful
[0:03:26] <+collapsedVigil> I remember the Subnautica stream, this is gonna be a nightmare for him
[0:03:28] <niddron> @desertpenguin you're not missing anything, what flavour was the soup?
[0:03:39] <nawadap136> NANI?!
[0:03:40] <britishtrex> it's a game about being a hero where nothing matters, you don't affect anything and every choice you made was orchestrated. it's genius
[0:03:41] <+ennui_on_me> I played a bit of the first one but was too busy and ended up quitting. This isn't a sequel, it's a reimagining basically.
[0:03:45] <+DesertPenguin> It's also made by Russians so I assume we're here for the Vintage Euro-Jank
[0:03:51] <jimmypurple> isnt there already a bad twin peaks game? deadly premonition or something?
[0:03:54] <mr_gunn> If pat plays the big game will it be bigger?
[0:03:56] <nawadap136> YO THIS SHIT IS KINO
[0:03:57] <niddron> should have watched the mandalore review for this game
[0:04:09] <%MaddyCaddy> It's a good review
[0:04:09] <RyuuAoi> FINALLY! @angriestpat has admitted that he is a PATHOLOGICAL LIAR. This is an intervention. Thank you all for being here today. Step one is admitting your faults. Good on you, Pat!
[0:04:18] <pejorativehymn> ye we in for some kino
[0:04:19] <+BusterRepukken> Mandalore broke his back for that review. Literally
[0:04:32] <mr_gunn> Who’s mandalore?
[0:04:35] <HoIlywood_SN> it is time for the weird game
[0:04:35] <marvinbrewton25> No thats woolie the liar madden
[0:04:39] <LazyLudens> does it spoil?
[0:04:43] <Frostydough1> Only a pathological liar would admit that they are a pathological liar...
[0:04:45] <+BusterRepukken> Yes
[0:04:47] <+ennui_on_me> It's a good weird though

[0:05:42] <mr_gunn> I think I’ve heard of him before, but I probably forgot. It’s been a while
[0:05:52] <britishtrex> The game is very kojima/george lucas. all the writing is on the nose and theatrical so eye of the beholder type stuff
[0:06:00] <jimmypurple> Do any of yoy have a cat that actively chooses to lay on your face? it makes it very hard to see the stream lol
[0:06:00] <Habblewater> !uptime
[0:06:01] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6m 2s.

[0:24:44] <%Ranryu692> so he was a snake
[0:24:45] <%HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat a violent hockey player?
[0:24:45] <MassConnect> so Pat is friends with Woolie because Woolie is like Pat's mom?
[0:24:45] <%LymanAl> Mainly huh?
[0:24:45] <Jkhmn12> yeah that's common
[0:24:46] <%ItsRatman> Yes thats the big one
[0:24:48] <Mister_McDerp> but selling out is good
[0:24:49] <%Ranryu692> Patrick the Snake
[0:24:50] <tacoisgoods> by the american traitor is the real reason
[0:24:52] <+HellfireComms> whoa WHAT

[0:25:00] <britishtrex> remember kids never have heros
[0:25:02] <+nekodelic> but did the glove fit his hand?
[0:25:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> TRAITOR
[0:25:03] <+lethallunacyx> The wife beating, the lesser of the two evils
[0:25:06] <Frostydough1> So THATS where Pat learned to beat Paige...
[0:25:08] <RyuuAoi> Nothing wrong with a little rough housing now and again.
[0:25:08] <%LymanAl> Pat supports spousal abuse, confirmed
[0:25:08] <nawadap136> its almost like the only reason people watch hockey is because of the fights
[0:25:08] <Frostydough1> at videogames
[0:25:09] <EuropanLamprey> How long until Pat becomes angry at everyone calling him Luke
[0:25:11] <Mendin> Hey @AngriestPat big advice for Pathologic 2: You WILL fuck up big. The game expects this and expects you to keep going despite.
[0:25:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> INFILTRATION STYLE
[0:25:15] <TeaJayGee> dont beat your wife people
[0:25:16] <+ChiefWilly> Hero always let you down
[0:25:18] <niddron> wife beating, classic
[0:25:18] <%Ranryu692> never have real-life heroes
[0:25:18] <rytisone> but Goku
[0:25:18] <%wannabemoogle> Well your mom got you back by getting you to say turquoise wrong
[0:25:20] <nukle0nik> look up to ideals, not to people
[0:25:22] <Mister_McDerp> only have fictional heroes
[0:25:23] <darkbotle> And never meet your heroes
[0:25:25] <Vakojin> Could have been called MachomanRandySavage Boivin
[0:25:25] <+ConLin_Arts_> but you are my hero BibleThump
[0:25:26] <Psyramics> Allow Superman and Spiderman to be your hero and you dont need real people
[0:25:27] <%nmaten> recognize the world as the hopeless hellscape that it is
[0:25:28] <+DoctorDerp388> only have dead heroes
[0:25:28] <garagon31> Ed Belfour best goalie
[0:25:28] <%Nordguy> good thing YOU'RE my hero, Pat!
[0:25:28] <+Clundy> His wife knew
[0:25:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:25:29] <+crowmium> Don't idolize sports players is more like
[0:25:29] <+arancet> dont admire anyone, son
[0:25:30] <GoYaK> Except for Pat, he's MY hero
[0:25:31] <+wmeldrum> Mr Rogers tho
[0:25:31] <Gruntini> Humans are just people
[0:25:31] <+TehBeerBaron> WEIRD AL WOULD NEVER
[0:25:33] <ElenaManetta> I believe never be a fan of people, be a fan of things.
[0:25:34] <Jkhmn12> has pat played pathologic 1?
[0:25:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> WHAT A SUPRISE
[0:25:38] <+neutral_guy> Has Pat ever heard of/played Pathologic at all?
[0:25:38] <+SoarFlyer> @ItsAbout9000 trolling is being an asshole to try and make people mad/annoyed, shitposting is being an asshole to try and make people chuckle/smirk
[0:25:39] <ScreamLord> Heroes are for loosers
[0:25:40] <joylent_blue> just pick someone who's already dead
[0:25:43] <Habblewater> who is BAU NOAE?
[0:25:44] <ape_hawk> yeah, too bad you like like Louis CK
[0:25:45] <+lethallunacyx> I really love Louis ck, ooooh no
[0:25:45] <%GarbageNirvana> People forget that heroes are just people like the rest of us
[0:25:45] <nukle0nik> and that's why we don't talk about Louis CK anymore
[0:25:45] <%Bailey__gaming> It makes me laugh that Chris Jericho's dad was a famous ice hocky man
[0:25:50] <JetpackMcQuack> Sonic never lets me down
[0:25:50] <Ketch0r> pat is my hero
[0:25:51] <RyuuAoi> Goku beats Chi Chi off screen in Super.
[0:25:52] <AtTheSpeedOf> Is he playing this because of the hbomberguy video?
[0:25:52] <+HellfireComms> Angriest Pat found naked in a tent which he believes gives him SEXUAL POWERS
[0:25:54] <SilverFaustX> adolf
[0:25:55] <goatlord_> Pat how to I rotate my saves IRL?
[0:25:57] <niddron> "Hope my hero hasn't touched any kids toda- Oh no!"
[0:25:57] <+crowmium> >No More Heroes🤔
[0:25:57] <darkbotle> Unless your hero just is a general fuckup
[0:25:58] <ElenaManetta> what happens if dirt is uncovered.
[0:25:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> ALWAYS HAVE THAT ONE REAL
[0:25:59] <+DoctorDerp388> EPSTEIN

[0:26:04] <joylent_blue> LUL

[0:26:07] <ape_hawk> but then you learn, posthomously, that they did something bad
[0:26:07] <+nekodelic> Bob Ross too
[0:26:07] <akimbokirilenko> Pick Anime heros
[0:26:08] <+arancet> didnt stop that british kids show guy salwell?

[0:57:48] <%starotter70> Empty the sack
[0:57:48] <Nero9341> I started watching DS9 and given on your comments about the khaless tng episode, how do you think Woolie would react to Winn
[0:57:49] <britishtrex> in that order?
[0:57:49] <dukenux> But aren't donations technically gifts, haha got em Kappa
[0:57:50] <ScreamLord> I'm neutral. Give don't give, I don't care
[0:57:50] <HoboCabs> scratch the pee out of the balls
[0:57:52] <%cureneckbeard> Pat doesn't like gifts because you can't throw out gifts, and therefore cannot litter
[0:57:52] <SainEdge> videogame? PogChamp
[0:57:53] <$Zalthia> I'm so excited.
[0:57:55] <+PanicSwytch> Scratch them balls
[0:57:57] <+Jordan_z123> Pound some monsters
[0:58:02] <$Remery_> That ball scratch is going to turn into a wank session :/
[0:58:06] <marvel877> 56051 ALEXIS-NIHON, MONTREAL, QUEBEC
[0:58:08] <%meltdown547> Right after an involved story about how much you cared and enjoyed the Saturn gift.
[0:58:09] <$Zalthia> I've been playing Pathologic 2 again, it's so hard for me to not save scum.
[0:58:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Remery_ Circle of life bro LUL
[0:58:28] <grendius> @bleugh well, the reviews are kinda...it's not about the jank, it's more the reviewers kinda jinxing their playthroughs and, well, not getting the atmosphere of thr game
[0:58:31] <joylent_blue> gifts are different when you're a kid, everything is magical then
[0:58:32] <Habblewater> Pat's off to scratch his legs and stretch his balls
[0:58:38] <$Zalthia> Should we tell Pat that the game doesn't pause when you loot?
[0:58:42] <%wannabemoogle> Does it play better than the first one?
[0:58:45] <$Remery_> @BallerSwagBro9k true xD
[0:58:48] <$Zalthia> @wannabemoogle Yes
[0:58:55] <TheRickMaster> what was that address???
[0:58:56] <$Zalthia> @wannabemoogle There's a run button in the second one.
[0:58:56] <%dalmek> Scratchologic 2
[0:59:01] <Habblewater> don't tell him nuuuthin
[0:59:09] <SainEdge> @wannabemoogle much better
[0:59:09] <%starotter70> @Zalthia That's legit game changing
[0:59:13] <grendius> @zalthia yeah, probably should.
[0:59:17] <%wannabemoogle> @Zalthia Oh thank god
[0:59:32] <JustChoppa> @zalthia нет
[0:59:32] <lotharrio> TIL that Cyclops, Wolverine, Jean Grey and Emma Frost are canonically engaged in some sort of polyamorous fuck pile.
[0:59:41] <$Zalthia> @JustChoppa ?
[0:59:45] <lamash7u> Saw "Pathologic 2" on Pat's feed and I immediately hopped on.
[0:59:45] <sakeydo> yeah the mailbag probably helped kill any desire for him recieveing gifts. Who could ever out do us the fans right.
[0:59:50] <Jkhmn12> that's hot
[0:59:54] <JustChoppa> no i mean
[0:59:58] <grendius> @lotharrio sauce for that
[1:00:06] <%cureneckbeard> I like that we've got a full hour of donations and rambling before the game. This is classic Pat time.
[1:00:07] <%starotter70> @lotharrio A cauldron as it were
[1:00:13] <Matermind0> Oh right, I thought we were playing Classic HD
[1:00:23] <%GarbageNirvana> tbf the mailbag got insane
[1:00:31] <+DesertPenguin> @cureneckbeard you have a very serious mission ahead of you with Pat's neck lol
[1:00:32] <%honeyman18> I hope we see him struggle to buy eggs today.
[1:00:43] <nawadap136> e g g
[1:00:50] <kindashagg> eggie
[1:00:58] <$Zalthia> was playing Pathologic 2 the other night and I literally saw a kid t-pose for dominance over a corpse.
[1:01:03] <Mendin> @AngriestPat The most important th ing to internalize about Pathologic 2: WHEN (not if) you fuck up, the game expects you to roll with it and salvage from there, not reload and try again.
[1:01:09] <lethallylactic> NotLikeThis
[1:01:11] <JustChoppa> @lotharrio did hickman confirmed it?
[1:01:13] <%starotter70> The mailbag would have eventually led to it's logical conclusion of body parts being sent at somepoint
[1:01:16] <+professormorrigan> LUL
[1:01:16] <lamash7u> Holding out hope that Pat can see this to the end, but this game is a real kick in the balls.
[1:01:18] <Gruntini> LUL
[1:01:20] <lotharrio> ***
[1:01:20] <lethallylactic> Kreygasm
[1:01:21] <RyuuAoi> Did Pat ever saw if he got that infection cleared up?
[1:01:22] <herfaintsmile> has pat not started playing yet??

[1:01:35] <%nmaten> you had like 5 minutes to plan something to say when you came back adn that was it?
[1:01:36] <lethallylactic> Paige hasn't destroyed your nipples already Pat?
[1:01:38] <$Zalthia> So exciiiiiiiittteeed
[1:01:38] <%honeyman18> just use electric tape

[1:01:41] <rytisone> men dont need nipples anyway
[1:01:42] <BinaryBetrayer> I really wanted to like Pathologic 1, but goddamn the walking

[1:01:51] <HeroSolaire> good luck using the menus
[1:01:51] <+korean_random> nah, man, just fuck that shit up
[1:01:57] <JayEarly> This game is designed to prey on mind-goblins
[1:01:59] <grendius> Controller is not a good idea...
[1:02:02] <SolverCODO> Is it like that Paige nip that gets scared and hides inside her body?
[1:02:09] <+ConLin_Arts_> Is the first game any good?
[1:02:14] <%deviljhojho_> aww tomatoSmile
[1:02:15] <+nekodelic> controller is not a good idea for this one
[1:02:19] <Matermind0> Oh this is a bad idea
[1:02:21] <Mendin> The first game is very good and you should never play it
[1:02:23] <lethallylactic> D:
[1:02:24] <%Rafferty3231> jezuz
[1:02:26] <+Dr_Mooose> wow

[1:03:25] <+Jontman42> Yeah I see her alright
[1:03:26] <%AncelDeLambert> it's pretty obvious when my family says "we want YOU in charge of the estate when we die"

[1:03:26] <%Conyst> just watch the two hour pathologic video from hbomberguy if you want to know the first game story

[1:03:36] <$onlypuppet> Very pretty
[1:03:39] <grendius> @honeyman18 *nervously* yeaaaaah...
[1:03:40] <Habblewater> oh yeah this is def a keyboard and mouse kinda game
[1:03:40] <britishtrex> these games are great because it's the antithesis to every rpg ever
[1:03:41] <dukenux> I actually never played first one, does that game spoil anyrging?
[1:03:41] <KoryMccool> ye
[1:03:45] <%SudoKillUser> Yaya
[1:03:46] <$Zalthia> @dukenux no
[1:03:47] <+FierceDeityGabe> don't listen to that shit
[1:03:48] <%nmaten> ok

[1:03:54] <Jetsfantasy> Geforce isn't accounting for streaming
[1:03:55] <young_office_chan> oh shit this that h bomber guy joint!
[1:03:56] <%BinaryForest> Turn some settings down imo, it's not terribly well optimized
[1:04:00] <BinaryBetrayer> My brain won't let me play this without finishing the first one and I hate it.
[1:04:05] <+bananawarrior1> wait
[1:04:09] <+bananawarrior1> si this a horror game?
[1:04:12] <britishtrex> Nah this game is like a remake of the first game kind of. narratively it even comments on it
[1:04:13] <%ennui_on_me> @dukenux this is a reimagining more than a sequel, doesn't expect previous experience
[1:04:15] <JayEarly> Kinda?
[1:04:15] <%Faustgesicht> Oh I thought this was the Cyberpunk game again
[1:04:15] <ELuscious> @AngriestPat you played the first one?
[1:04:17] <Mendin> Survival Horror kinda
[1:04:18] <darkbotle> is geforce experience optimised for horse balls?
[1:04:20] <$Zalthia> @BinaryBetrayer The second one is a redux/remake. You don't need to finish the first one.
[1:04:25] <+nekodelic> @bananawarrior1 yes and no
[1:04:25] <+bananawarrior1> doodBenny doodBenny doodBenny doodBenny yay
[1:04:25] <Gruntini> yes no
[1:04:27] <sakeydo> ooh, half naked lady, Im in!
[1:04:27] <+neutral_guy> Super Survival Horror
[1:04:28] <%BinaryForest> It's a remake of 1, more or less
[1:04:30] <dukenux> ...how
[1:04:31] <BinaryBetrayer> I know, but it still feels wrong somehow.
[1:04:31] <ape_hawk> isnt this a remaster or somethjing?
[1:04:32] <Ser_Randal> ok boomer
[1:04:33] <ElenaManetta> Is this one of those linear stories or a massive side quest games
[1:04:33] <%honeyman18> Player Horror
[1:04:34] <Sapphire_Breeze> the first one is cool but jank
[1:04:35] <BinaryBetrayer> One day...
[1:04:35] <+Mitchellsocks> It's not so much a horror game, as a miserable experience
[1:04:35] <+Azarian1> Don't really need to play the first one
[1:04:37] <megakruemel> but how many nekid ladies will be in the game
[1:04:41] <zamzoph> It tastes like purple
[1:04:41] <Gruntini> It's a remake
[1:04:41] <ElenaManetta> it looks like one of those old school 1000 side quest games
[1:04:44] <%sporeian94> Had a great bussiness idea the other day, basically KFC but we sell just the deep fried skins of the chicken
[1:04:44] <Mendin> This is a complete remake of the original
[1:04:44] <Manwad> tastes like purp
[1:04:45] <%Nordguy> you're gonna love the doctor
[1:04:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DrinkPurple DrinkPurple DrinkPurple DrinkPurple DrinkPurple
[1:04:47] <dukenux> it has a 2 in the title
[1:04:47] <%Wynzler> Your least favorite youtube dumbass made a video recently about Pathologic
[1:04:48] <Mrrccava> mmmm purple
[1:04:48] <+Grayhammatter> it tastes like purple?
[1:04:48] <+Azarian1> This does only have one of the three characters playable though
[1:04:49] <%QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat just remember that your fuckups are NOT fail states and have fun
[1:04:50] <$Zalthia> There is a lady with her boobs and nips out at one point.
[1:04:51] <+Dr_Mooose> I thought the first one already had a remaster?
[1:04:57] <%maxkur67> @megakruemel more than single :)
[1:04:58] <+jetjagger222> can't see shit capn
[1:05:02] <JustChoppa> удачи тебе с этим дерьмом
[1:05:02] <$Zalthia> It's dark.

[1:05:06] <try_it_sis_> the remake of the first is being made
[1:05:08] <megakruemel> guys remember not to tell him the thing.
[1:05:08] <Habblewater> I didn't get very far but there wasn't that many spooks
[1:05:08] <JayEarly> @elenamanetta if anything it’s like Dead Rising
[1:05:09] <%Lambda_man> @angriestpat 2 is both a sequel and remake of 1
[1:05:10] <rosabellamelantha> @AngriestPat you are probably going to hate this tbh, this is a game about being miserable
[1:05:10] <%BinaryForest> You're not gonna jump a lot
[1:05:10] <Matermind0> It’s a Slavic depression game
[1:05:11] <Saltima> hbummerguy made an okay vid on the first one
[1:05:12] <+TOONFOOD> Is this a shooty scary game, or a run away and cry spooky game?
[1:05:15] <darkbotle> murder them, Pat murder thm alaaall
[1:05:16] <SPidERMan8576> Monster #2??
[1:05:17] <+toilet_chan> jump is pointless lmao

[1:05:23] <Mrrccava> anyone who has ever tasted BLUE, the Gatorade flavor knows what colors taste like
[1:05:25] <Habblewater> It's a run away game
[1:05:28] <grendius> @justchoppa дерьмом в хорошем смысле?
[1:05:28] <%deviljhojho_> its a "oh fuck that shouldnt be happening" game
[1:05:29] <lethallylactic> @TOONFOOD It's an existential nightmare scary game.

[1:05:54] <+korean_random> monkaS
[1:05:54] <lotharrio> Oh wait, I saw this. The start is super confusing.
[1:05:58] <Run44forrest> VERGIL
[1:05:58] <JayEarly> It’s an “oh god I’m starving and I caught the plague” scary game
[1:06:00] <%terminallyCapriciousz> wait pat, what do you mean
[1:06:00] <%Agami23> this guy looks like handsome jack and rick sanchez had a kid

[1:07:11] <Habblewater> This game isn't really "Fun" but that seems to be the point

[1:07:42] <%BinaryForest> You can change difficulty stuff at any time, but it's modular
[1:07:44] <+jetjagger222> maybe its a quake 1 thing
[1:07:45] <hat_under_bread> They're just trying to copy the greatest game of all time: Oblivion.

[1:07:50] <+Mitchellsocks> All Bachelors Are Bastards

[1:08:01] <garagon31> Pathologic only has 1 difficulty. Butt Pounding
[1:08:11] <Matermind0> The only difficulty is Pain

[1:11:01] <%Wynzler> Only rats live there
[1:11:02] <+bananawarrior1> what is this game about
[1:11:03] <%ennui_on_me> Yknow, I don't think people like you very much
[1:11:03] <ElenaManetta> Someone going "You're HATED here!" over and over again sounds like some kind of horror movie scene
[1:11:03] <shiny_prinny> lol called out wrong person
[1:11:05] <%Wynzler> Pat you know what you must do
[1:11:05] <+professormorrigan> Polyhedrons back?
[1:11:06] <%Hobojo153> So what's this game about?
[1:11:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> Chat, is this a direct sequel to the first game? Am I gonna be lost not having finished the 1st?
[1:11:07] <Habblewater> It changes a lot
[1:11:08] <+MrRabbles> Cemetery and chilll
[1:11:08] <%terminallyCapriciousz> tfw nano got blamed for someone else wanting to spoil
[1:11:11] <%wannabemoogle> oh I see it
[1:11:12] <Rodzzila> what is this game?
[1:11:17] <%sporeian94> Why does everyone hate you everywhere? What is this? Middle School
[1:11:19] <+TheNeonGraveyard> "you're always welcome in the cemetery" = "go die"
[1:11:19] <$onlypuppet> I know some birds, they drop feathers
[1:11:19] <Mendin> This is a Big Russian survival horror misery game about trying to save a plague-ridden town
[1:11:20] <Nanomachiner> tfw sounds like people calling me out
[1:11:20] <%MaddyCaddy> Oh I didn't know

[1:11:25] <IAmYoungDabNow> This is like me in irl
[1:11:26] <+ClaudeMcGarren> that says odd not oldd pat get your glasses you bland goblin
[1:11:29] <%BinaryForest> @CappuccinoGuil It's a remake, mostly. References to the first game are vague, but it covers the same plotline
[1:11:29] <+Junkfist> A lot of this game is looking at something that makes no sense and everyone says "of course"
[1:11:32] <herfaintsmile> i like the background moaning or whatever that is
[1:11:32] <$Zalthia> @CappuccinoGuil It's complicated, but it's a redux and a sequel. You wil not be lost having not finished the first one.
[1:11:37] <%starotter70> This song is great
[1:11:37] <%nmaten> colon
[1:11:38] <Saltima> I recommend multiple saves

[1:11:52] <%Hobojo153> It's time to medicine
[1:11:54] <dukenux> dont like the constant moaning soundtrack
[1:11:54] <%Wynzler> These moans are gross

[1:39:22] <%Hobojo153> Heart light dark bart
[1:39:25] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> one thing I can definitely appreciate so far is this game isn't holding your hand for SHIT
[1:39:30] <$onlypuppet> Fat can grow around the heart, making it weaker
[1:39:32] <MassConnect> that alone was better than anything in death stranding
[1:39:39] <MattsKitchen67> ah yes. the russian train dreams
[1:39:42] <HeroToxiko> I wonder what would have happened if you hit that prompt for heart again?
[1:39:47] <%nano_vg> this seems like a game i have to watch lore vids to fully get

[1:40:04] <Habblewater> CUNO'S A FOOKIN BIRD
[1:40:11] <LokimenD> How much does Pat knows about the Pathologic games?
[1:40:12] <britishtrex> honestly the lore is not the point
[1:40:13] <Hoanui> How much does pat know about the story of the original pathologic?
[1:40:16] <$onlypuppet> Bye Edward
[1:40:23] <BoneBagMel> and people thought Death Stranding was weird... try Russian Art
[1:40:24] <$Zalthia> I never saw that o.o
[1:40:25] <Naho_Saenoki> @LokimenD NOTHING.
[1:40:25] <%Kiwami_gaim> wtf is happenng lol
[1:40:28] <%wannabemoogle> Velvet voice man
[1:40:29] <Mendin> @sakeydo A local surgeon returns to his hometown in the russian steppe and has to help with a plague outbreak
[1:40:29] <%Hobojo153> This game is just new LSD Dream Emulator isn't it
[1:40:31] <%Antoids> pat like go down
[1:40:33] <LokimenD> @Naho_Saenoki GOOD
[1:40:33] <HeroToxiko> Don't worry about Greg, he's just the sleepy time ghillie suit birdman
[1:40:35] <Angry_Ev1L> @Hoanui seems like nothing
[1:40:35] <britishtrex> like literally none of this matters and that's the point
[1:40:36] <%BinaryForest> @Hoanui nothing, he never even heard of it until 2
[1:40:39] <laguerrilha> God is that you? BlessRNG
[1:40:43] <JumbleJams> you don't really need to know the first game for this, but it adds some flavor
[1:40:43] <Hoanui> Ok, sick
[1:40:46] <pantherpiss2> i thought this game wasnt in enlgish
[1:40:55] <SuperHoppedUp> How does the first one hold up?
[1:40:58] <%Zeghart> monkaS Who was laughing
[1:41:08] <Mucmaster> @sakeydo he just did the tutorial. Premise is you go back to your home town which is experiencing a mysterious plague
[1:41:08] <TootPirate> sleeping in those houses should like suck with the traintrack RIGHT THERE
[1:41:09] <%Double_Tap_That> @JumbleJams I mean, it's more of a remake than a sequel.
[1:41:12] <JayEarly> Why is that every fictional Russian is British?
[1:41:14] <%Hobojo153> Who's talking sipsipSipsipblind
[1:41:15] <JumbleJams> @pantherpiss2 there's a better english translation now
[1:41:18] <+sirrice77> @sakeydo a town in the boonies in eastern europe falls victim to a strange plague and the protags have to save it before the military bombs it to hell to burn out the disease
[1:41:19] <%BinaryForest> First game is MEGA janky, 2 is an improvement in every way
[1:41:27] <Mendin> The first one has many jank bits but also has two additional story povs
[1:41:35] <%Zeghart> @SuperHoppedUp It's...playable, but kinda frustrating - the second one is basically a remake
[1:41:45] <%JJnAJjohnson> @jayearly easiest “cheat” accent to fill in for shit
[1:41:46] <%BinaryForest> Only thing 1 has over it is the other character routes, but imo you're better off waiting for them to add those to 2 unless you're really curious
[1:41:48] <%blastazoid26> Huehuehuehue
[1:41:50] <%honeyman18> First one is Painful on Purpose and honestly neat. this one you can run so much better??

[1:41:59] <JumbleJams> anyone interested in the first game, just watch hbomber's newest video
[1:42:04] <+TheBeachEpisode> 2 is basically a remake of one of the stories from the first game, the rest will come if funding also does
[1:42:05] <Dementedpenguin> Of all the portraits, you chose that to hang in your house DansGame
[1:42:07] <sakeydo> well shit. lol the minute I asked narration kicked in. thanks anyway chat.

[1:42:37] <dukenux> oh jesus
[1:42:38] <%BinaryForest> @honeyman18 2's survival aspects are kind of harsher, but the sprint and mind map stuff balances it out so that you don't have to run around checking up on everytone at random
[1:42:39] <@commanderclaw> It's Russian

[1:43:10] <JayEarly> Wellcome to Russia, life’s a bitch and then you die

[1:52:41] <Psyramics> "Umbiliical Cord" Bloodborne or Death Stranding?
[1:52:45] <%Wynzler> Yes
[1:52:49] <%JJnAJjohnson> Yes
[1:52:52] <Nanomachiner> Yes
[1:52:57] <ElenaManetta> I cant tell if Pat is enjoying the game or getting frustrated from the confusion
[1:52:59] <cherrycottontail> :)
[1:53:00] <%bread_assassin> Alright,I just got here. WHAT IS this game?
[1:53:06] <Tucker0603> every time I hear Burakh I wanna yell out OBAMA
[1:53:07] <Nanomachiner> @bread_assassin Yes
[1:53:18] <Angry_Ev1L> @bread_assassin real goty
[1:53:29] <gluemanofficial> Solid life advice: You can sleep at somebody's house if they like you
[1:53:30] <%JJnAJjohnson> @tucker0603 LUL
[1:53:39] <Panquake25> they're deffinitely not
[1:53:47] <+cyclosu0> @bread_assassin the best game of the year bud
[1:53:48] <JumbleJams> :)
[1:53:51] <sleepysquiddy> russia really is off the shits
[1:53:52] <Angry_Ev1L> ahahha
[1:53:52] <nawadap136> YUP
[1:53:52] <%Double_Tap_That> Big town
[1:53:53] <%starotter70> Have fun
[1:53:53] <$onlypuppet> So dismissive
[1:53:53] <%GrayMatterMiner> GET READY
[1:53:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> big ass map
[1:53:56] <+MrRabbles> the panic is setting in
[1:54:00] <comfyakerman> a walk is required
[1:54:01] <black_pariah> yeah its like that
[1:54:03] <Panquake25> welcome to the real walking simulator!
[1:54:04] <%BinaryForest> Goblins activate
[1:54:04] <SainEdge> big panic LUL
[1:54:05] <%honeyman18> Big Walks
[1:54:06] <Saltima> *** pathalogic, pat.
[1:54:15] <Teyaric> That is CORRECT. This game is BIG on WALKING. You're /SUPPOSED/ to have time to BIG THINK about all the ART.
[1:54:15] <Matermind0> Goblins are now!
[1:54:15] <+MrRabbles> i think the mind goblins might make this game difficult
[1:54:17] <dukenux> Pat's logic 2
[1:54:18] <Mendin> Time is a resource. Travel Time is the big resource management
[1:54:19] <%Nordguy> this game is mostly slow walking, pat.
[1:54:19] <%starotter70> Don't forget, you'll probably have to sleep @AngriestPat
[1:54:19] <+neutral_guy> Pat this is probably the best advice your gonna get but you gotta understand the Hobo economy! loot EVERY trash can
[1:54:21] <Nero270> Oh no, I don't think you're ready for Pathologic 2 @AngriestPat
[1:54:22] <gluemanofficial> Wait I thought pathologic was that flash game where you create a virus to infect the world
[1:54:24] <JumbleJams> i suspect this game will be bad for the mind goblins
[1:54:27] <Angry_Ev1L> here's your math - YOU ARE FUCKED
[1:54:28] <%maxkur67> @AngriestPat every day is ~2 hours + dialogue
[1:54:28] <+Darren716> The time limit is gonna kill pats desire to play this won't jt
[1:54:31] <Mucmaster> Pathalogic, more like Walkalogic
[1:54:32] <DraxTD> MATH HARDER PAT
[1:54:33] <+Despera__> Fun fact: the first game didn't even have a run button
[1:54:35] <Explodincatz> its not a game its an experience
[1:54:39] <%Double_Tap_That> Hope you like survival games, cause this one's a doozy.
[1:54:47] <deadbrainpl> Oh shit Pat is playing Russian Depression Simulator 2?!
[1:54:47] <comfyakerman> yeah
[1:54:47] <lamash7u> @AngriestPat Thank your lucky stars that unlike the first game there is a sprint in this one.
[1:54:47] <%GrayMatterMiner> no iot isnt
[1:54:50] <Mendin> NOPE, It's NOT enough
[1:54:50] <+cyclosu0> music is so good
[1:54:52] <comfyakerman> it is not enough
[1:54:53] <%JJnAJjohnson> 1 stream + 1k viewers = embarras
[1:54:56] <comfyakerman> welcome
[1:55:00] <%GrayMatterMiner> make it enough idiot @AngriestPat
[1:55:00] <+zombinedotrar> "That's not enough" hahahahahahaha Pat you sweet virgin
[1:55:01] <a_mad_dragon> or better yet Walkalotgic
[1:55:03] <%starotter70> @gluemanofficial I think that's Pandemic
[1:55:03] <%Wynzler> Time to meet the Royal Rat Vanguard
[1:55:03] <Psyramics> Can we talk to the rats? are they friendly rats?
[1:55:03] <$Zalthia> The only day you can complete everything is the first day.
[1:55:04] <comfyakerman> the town will eat you alive
[1:55:06] <LGWPhanto> You walked all over America, Pat. You got this.
[1:55:06] <%BinaryForest> Fyi dialogue freezes time, as does dialogue, and I thnk trading? BUT looting does not, so if you have to move your inventory around back out and use the menu
[1:55:07] <$onlypuppet> Feed your Soul, King! OWL2019foot
[1:55:07] <sleepysquiddy> jermaChomp
[1:55:22] <dukenux> Stalin?
[1:55:36] <%Nordguy> this videogame will drain your soul-balls, pat.
[1:55:37] <rytisone> you know why
[1:55:41] <comfyakerman> Shabnak the man eater
[1:55:42] <%nano_vg> the lighting is good
[1:55:44] <comfyakerman> the bone spirit
[1:55:45] <+Javaa01> That's the point, you'll never have enough time, and regardless of how much time you have, you can't run from death
[1:55:49] <Psyramics> aaayy, its mythology references we dont know about cause they're super foreign!
[1:56:03] <gluemanofficial> Nightjar has taken pretty good care of his moustache considering there's a weird plague going on
[1:56:12] <MassConnect> use time stop
[1:56:21] <$Zalthia> Plauge hasn't started yet.
[1:56:32] <Mendin> Yeah Eli's still on the farm drawing

[1:57:31] <sakeydo> this is a quiet ass game.
[1:57:32] <sleepysquiddy> i really do like the design in this game
[1:57:45] <Mendin> When The Orb appears up top, it means Plot Web has developed
[1:57:50] <+cyclosu0> there's no plague yet chat
[1:57:57] <sleepysquiddy> the plot orb
[1:58:00] <%GrayMatterMiner> later in the game yer gonna wanna give succ to whoever designed the idea map

[2:02:08] <LGWPhanto> I have a feeling Pat would love the Bachelor.
[2:02:13] <%JJnAJjohnson> @ballerswagbro9k 400,508,798,000 dead cops
[2:02:28] <SolverCODO> This guy looks way more detailed than the other similar ones
[2:02:39] <britishtrex> everyone just has their conscience in literal form just hanging out in the back
[2:02:50] <gluemanofficial> Talking about a dude right in front of him like that? Mask dude is cold
[2:02:50] <Zepper202> Hey Pat, is this your first Ice Lodge game?
[2:02:54] <+TheBeachEpisode> sitting in the rafter like tyler's dad in the eric andre show
[2:03:01] <+AllenDeadman> what this game about?
[2:03:06] <herfaintsmile> those reflections sure are convenient
[2:03:13] <%dalmek> is that other dude showing you where the scalpel was?
[2:03:15] <ambadev> Check the cabinet yo
[2:03:16] <%dalmek> if so, neato
[2:03:17] <%NDHCemployee> @AllenDeadman It's complicated

[2:03:19] <+cyclosu0> ?
[2:03:22] <Angry_Ev1L> that's an actual strand game LUL
[2:03:23] <%starotter70> @AllenDeadman 12 Days to stop a plague
[2:03:23] <sleepysquiddy> i guess if we go with the stage play idea its like their reflections are character monologues or somethin
[2:03:24] <Habblewater> Railway is best way over
[2:03:25] <JumbleJams> check your thoughts?
[2:03:27] <%ennui_on_me> @AllenDeadman You're a doctor who returns home to a shitty plague
[2:03:27] <$Zalthia> Yeah. If you don't loot it before talking to him there's a stage light too.
[2:03:37] <Panquake25> @AllenDeadman suffering
[2:03:40] <+CursedNobleman> only the bachelor is playable right? no haruspex?
[2:03:44] <+cyclosu0> time pat time
[2:03:44] <Mendin> You got it like that, pro
[2:03:48] <+MrRabbles> this is haruspex
[2:03:50] <herfaintsmile> whats this naked lady just hanging out
[2:03:50] <%starotter70> @CursedNobleman Other way around
[2:03:52] <$Zalthia> Other way around @CursedNobleman
[2:03:53] <+MrRabbles> bachelor is only in marble's nest
[2:03:54] <protomous> @CursedNobleman this is haruspex
[2:03:54] <dukenux> its so rusty it just crumbles
[2:03:55] <deadbrainpl> It's a game about what all Eastern European media is about - the crushing depression of reality and the desperation of man
[2:03:55] <%Double_Tap_That> @CursedNobleman No, only haruspex is playable
[2:03:57] <MassConnect> mind goblins
[2:03:57] <+CursedNobleman> ah, thanks yall
[2:04:01] <+AllenDeadman> I like al of the answers I got
[2:04:01] <Vivirmos> Tick tock
[2:04:02] <sleepysquiddy> haruspex is first this time ye
[2:04:12] <Panquake25> @CursedNobleman Haruspex only right now. Bachelor and changeling to be added later
[2:04:13] <Habblewater> there's 3 i think
[2:04:14] <%Double_Tap_That> Which is weird considered bachelor was best for beginners.
[2:04:14] <britishtrex> pfft you think they'd give you a good scalpel? what is this a game where the writers don't hate you?
[2:04:15] <SainEdge> @CursedNobleman the bachlor is playable in the dlc that came out a few weeks ago
[2:04:22] <+TheBeachEpisode> always somethin to do
[2:04:26] <krymzen5> this scales p big
[2:04:28] <+Junkfist> Last time Bachelor was first
[2:04:29] <+MrRabbles> that wasn't for you pat
[2:04:30] <Angry_Ev1L> don't worr yabout it
[2:04:30] <$Zalthia> Pat's face xD
[2:04:33] <ambadev> Don't worry about it
[2:04:34] <BinaryBetrayer> The Haruspex was the second campaign the first game
[2:04:37] <%starotter70> @AngriestPat Multiple Protag's in the first game
[2:04:37] <+cyclosu0> BREATH PAT
[2:04:38] <Mendin> In the original game, this character was the second playthrough
[2:04:38] <+Javaa01> That's the point, and you WILL lose
[2:04:38] <+corrosivePaladin> I love how much this is screwing with pat
[2:04:39] <Futuretimetraveller> LUL
[2:04:40] <+TheBeachEpisode> There's only one playable character in Pathologic 2
[2:04:42] <%Nordguy> dont worry bud
[2:04:42] <SainEdge> first game had 3 characters
[2:04:43] <Zepper202> Remember, this is the easy day
[2:04:44] <cutemuteprude> three characters, Pat
[2:04:44] <sleepysquiddy> bachelor was considered first in the first game
[2:04:45] <BinaryBetrayer> Oh no.
[2:04:46] <Mendin> Oh he's already breaking, I love it
[2:04:47] <+CursedNobleman> @AngriestPat OG pathologic had bachelor as the primary character
[2:04:48] <%dalmek> @AngriestPat they're talking about playable characters.
[2:04:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> There are multiple characters in the 1st game, you could play as them. Bachelor was 1st
[2:04:52] <ItsAGundamu> HahaHide
[2:04:53] <%maxkur67> @AngriestPat he meant that the Haruspex is a starting character of three in P2
[2:04:56] <Habblewater> fuggedaboutit
[2:05:00] <krymzen5> LUL
[2:05:02] <$Zalthia> Artemy is the Haruspex. A Haruspex is someone who takes out organs.
[2:05:04] <herfaintsmile> ......just RUNS at you
[2:05:05] <grendius> @sainedge but the DLC is kinda separate, no?
[2:05:05] <Mucmaster> In 1 you could play him or the bachelor first but bachelor was recommended to go first since it's "easier"
[2:05:06] <ElenaManetta> thanks for bolting at me
[2:05:08] <%Lambda_man> @cursednobleman they wanted to add the othdr characters, but the game's poor sales have delayed that
[2:05:08] <JumbleJams> full on sprint lol
[2:05:09] <%honeyman18> It's a Lovely Game, Huh?
[2:05:11] <$onlypuppet> Respect the community, I guess
[2:05:12] <sleepysquiddy> oh hey
[2:05:14] <krymzen5> that scared me
[2:05:21] <SainEdge> @grendius yes as far as i know

[2:05:40] <pan_nochal> just tuned in, how does Pat like this

[2:06:31] <%maxkur67> @Lambda_man delayed, but word of mouth helps. All those articles that got viral are based on outdated stuff from june-july, before Mandalore & etc.

[2:07:51] <AliceAstro> hi troops
[2:07:54] <%Double_Tap_That> @AngriestPat This game is very much a "learn the hard way" kind of game.
[2:07:59] <+Javaa01> Kids LOVE nuts, and they don't know the value of money, so you can scam the FUCK out of them
[2:08:01] <captainnathaniel> lets just say that this game will make kojima look like a totally normal guy
[2:08:01] <JayEarly> FUCK IT, HOBODOC
[2:08:02] <%maxkur67> @davimotion96 too early for that :)
[2:08:04] <gluemanofficial> That reminds me I have some mixed nuts in my cabinet
[2:08:05] <%JJnAJjohnson> @cyclosu0 “hobonomics” is my new favorite word
[2:08:05] <sleepysquiddy> no laughin this time
[2:08:06] <%BinaryForest> It's just a generic townperson model
[2:08:11] <Ipsenscastle> I am amazed anyone perseveres enough with this game to get to wherever it gets good
[2:08:14] <JumbleJams> be aware of your money
[2:08:15] <%honeyman18> Cuno is a god now
[2:08:22] <Teyaric> He's a black-dog style death omen, associated with satan. A last bad deal before the last bad trip.
[2:08:26] <dukenux> Walnuts Peanuts
[2:08:28] <%ennui_on_me> walnuts, peanuts, pineapple smells
[2:08:39] <krymzen5> @Double_Tap_That @JJnAJjohnson ass so Russian survival horror. seems way bigger than i was expecting
[2:08:42] <Panquake25> LUL
[2:08:42] <britishtrex> 'aren't you tired of the grind'? higgs baker
[2:08:43] <Mendin> ho ho ho he thinks
[2:08:45] <krymzen5> ahh*
[2:08:48] <%dalmek> Cuno's got commerce and trade
[2:08:51] <+CursedNobleman> so i tried planescape for the third time, and its just not fun. the combat is a drag
[2:09:04] <Habblewater> flags
[2:09:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, remember time. There's a guy who was stabbed and needs medical attention fasty
[2:09:11] <dukenux> oh yeah, combat in Planescape sucks
[2:09:12] <captainnathaniel> LUL he is doing fine with food and water
[2:09:18] <+cyclosu0> @CursedNobleman thats not why planescape is good
[2:09:20] <%JJnAJjohnson> @krymzen5 I’m glad I just get to watch, but it’s pretty sick tbh
[2:09:28] <grendius> You've got time limit
[2:09:32] <JayEarly> Feel no shame in setting PST to easy
[2:09:32] <dukenux> put all your points into int to avoid it
[2:09:33] <%dalmek> OH the town's areas are named after cow body areas
[2:09:33] <Zebroneath> Fyi, this game is FUCKED
[2:09:33] <+neutral_guy> Rumors are starting to spread
[2:09:35] <Mucmaster> The rumour hit those parts of town
[2:09:35] <thelonechris> Why
[2:09:35] <%BinaryForest> Rumors are spreading
[2:09:36] <+MrRabbles> the panic
[2:09:36] <Habblewater> Because you murdered your dad
[2:09:36] <ToneBacas> there's an AI powered text adventure game where you can type in any action you can think of apparently.
[2:09:36] <rytisone> y
[2:09:37] <CrabSlacks> the best thing to do before a major disaster like a plague hits is to say that everything is fine
[2:09:37] <%dalmek> also the rumours are spreading
[2:09:38] <dukenux> LUL
[2:09:38] <herfaintsmile> they suspect u of murder
[2:09:40] <%honeyman18> REPUTATION GO DOWN
[2:09:42] <grendius> Jesus
[2:09:43] <%cureneckbeard> YY
[2:09:43] <Panquake25> reputation go down!
[2:09:44] <krymzen5> @JJnAJjohnson yea, i'm def intrigued
[2:09:45] <kamayanna> Rumors spreadin
[2:09:48] <JumbleJams> time is important, exploration less so
[2:09:51] <%Lambda_man> rumors are spreading
[2:09:52] <+CursedNobleman> @cyclosu0 oh no, ive read a lets play from start to finish, but playing it through myself is not as enjoyable
[2:09:53] <%BinaryForest> Get to someone you trust
[2:09:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> Rumors are spreading. Time is important
[2:09:54] <cutemuteprude> killed your dad bro
[2:09:55] <a_c_chirns> !uptime
[2:09:56] <dukenux> [Liam Neeson saying WHY in Darkman .gif]
[2:09:56] <pantherpiss2> why u acting so suspicious pat? maybe u did kill him
[2:09:56] <Radical_lenny> Sprint
[2:09:57] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 9m.
[2:09:58] <britishtrex> you watched the news so public go down
[2:09:59] <+TheBeachEpisode> always be movin somewhere
[2:09:59] <AliceAstro> whats happening?
[2:10:00] <pan_nochal> you want to keep running at all time
[2:10:04] <BinaryBetrayer> Pat will be saying "Why" a lot I feel.
[2:10:04] <lamash7u> @AngriestPat Time is a factor, so sprint.
[2:10:05] <collind99> @angriestpat you been playing Fallen order off stream? Still liking it?
[2:10:13] <+Vikingdeath1> ha! you can make pretty accurate assumptions for what Pat will play next by keeping watch on YT channels he likes. I too wanted to try this after his Video.
[2:10:17] <pan_nochal> you're not gonna make it if you just walk
[2:10:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> @AliceAstro people think he murdered his dad, so they are getting mad at him
[2:10:19] <KoryMccool> This game is legit
[2:10:19] <%ennui_on_me> Remember: this game is meant to be almost unbearable
[2:10:20] <+TheBeachEpisode> do not run unless you really gotta
[2:10:21] <Habblewater> yes and no
[2:10:21] <%BinaryForest> Water is everywhere right now, you want to sprint constantly
[2:10:24] <+cyclosu0> @CursedNobleman oh, did you make the same decisions as the let's play?
[2:10:27] <Radical_lenny> Run
[2:10:29] <SainEdge> just check every garbage bin and you are fine LUL
[2:10:30] <+TheBeachEpisode> your stamina gets capped from exhaustion
[2:10:32] <lamash7u> The first few days you can drink from water spigots that are all around town, so drink from those.
[2:10:36] <%BinaryForest> Don't sweat your stamina until you start having trouble finding more water
[2:10:36] <BinaryBetrayer> Be thankful you can run. That first game, man.
[2:10:37] <%Double_Tap_That> Worm time
[2:10:37] <+Despera__> water is every where at the start
[2:10:43] <MassConnect> is this game just a kobayashi maru?
[2:10:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WTF
[2:10:48] <krymzen5> wait wat
[2:10:50] <pan_nochal> running does increase thirst but that's why you stockpile water
[2:10:52] <herfaintsmile> what the fuck is that
[2:10:53] <dukenux> ohai Wurm
[2:10:55] <sleepysquiddy> worm friend
[2:10:57] <+TheBeachEpisode> worm gang worm gang
[2:11:00] <dukenux> this guy looks cool actually
[2:11:05] <SpaceGuntank> its a TONBERRY!
[2:11:06] <%Double_Tap_That> Rub his head for good luck
[2:11:06] <+cyclosu0> its a worm person
[2:11:09] <+cyclosu0> duh
[2:11:11] <antary> it's yoko taro
[2:11:11] <KoryMccool> Darth Vader?
[2:11:11] <AliceAstro> @CappuccinoGuil thank you <3
[2:11:11] <@StridentSong> That's a fuckin Tonberry
[2:11:12] <%JJnAJjohnson> WutFace
[2:11:18] <sleepysquiddy> theyre chill
[2:11:18] <SainEdge> water is no problem at the moment, there is free water everywhere, so you can get your stamina back up super easily
[2:11:23] <%moogleboy1984> low budget Emil cosplay
[2:11:24] <ItsAGundamu> Fuck I hate how they zoom into everyones face
[2:11:31] <dukenux> looks like a something from THe Moomins
[2:11:34] <$drfaustisdead> Well, this place is fucked.
[2:11:42] <+CursedNobleman> @cyclosu0 how many different decision points are in planescape? As I understand it, the route is linear, the only difference being more alignment type choices. and I apparently suck at being anything other than neutral good
[2:11:44] <dukenux> G U N
[2:12:02] <%Double_Tap_That> You want the revolver
[2:12:03] <dukenux> man, lotsa Kubrick stares in this game
[2:12:12] <Timurine> Do dialogues take time?
[2:12:15] <+CursedNobleman> welcome to russia LUL
[2:12:20] <$Zalthia> Nah, time stops during dialouge
[2:12:23] <cutemuteprude> nope, time freezes when talking
[2:12:25] <DoctorIdiot> this game looks weird
[2:12:27] <antary> you need high wisdom/int/charisma to even unlock certain dialogue in planescape
[2:12:33] <cutemuteprude> GET GUN
[2:12:34] <ShichiNoBushi> Hear herbs?
[2:12:34] <MassConnect> Russians have inheritance?
[2:12:36] <dukenux> STEAL
[2:12:39] <$Zalthia> guuuuuunnnn
[2:12:39] <%crazyspartan214> DO IT
[2:12:44] <ambadev> STEAL IT
[2:12:45] <sleepysquiddy> pig noises
[2:12:49] <pan_nochal> gun is useful but not as much as you think
[2:12:54] <dukenux> can you just nick it from the guy?
[2:12:57] <dukenux> and run away?
[2:12:58] <thetruthofyourbeing> DEW IT
[2:12:59] <%Double_Tap_That> Those are sections of the town.
[2:13:01] <+CursedNobleman> @antary mostly wisdom actually, intelligence for dakkon, and charisma to suck up to spoilerface
[2:13:01] <%Double_Tap_That> And yes.
[2:13:02] <Mendin> For now
[2:13:04] <+TheBeachEpisode> more will show up
[2:13:04] <+cyclosu0> @CursedNobleman well, neutral good is boring! Be an asshole or something. The whole reason that its so famous is due to its themes and story-telling. The combat is just have enough health potions to tank everything.
[2:13:05] <Futuretimetraveller> Jank aside, this game is a work of art
[2:13:07] <%honeyman18> Yup
[2:13:07] <NegaScottsuper> STEAL
[2:13:09] <@commanderclaw> the most important ATM
[2:13:10] <pan_nochal> no, they'll unlock on the map as you discover more shit
[2:13:10] <kamayanna> Basically
[2:13:12] <%Lambda_man> more will show up
[2:13:13] <Habblewater> sorta
[2:13:14] <SainEdge> mostly
[2:13:21] <%Nordguy> dont worry about it
[2:13:22] <+TheBeachEpisode> yeah red are the relevent ones for you right now
[2:13:26] <Angry_Ev1L> this game is what kojima wished he could make Kappa
[2:13:29] <dukenux> I noticed The Cathedral isn't there yet
[2:13:38] <+cyclosu0> @Angry_Ev1L couldn't agree more.
[2:13:40] <%BinaryForest> It's like the city in Witcher 3. At first you can't do aynthing cause you don't know anybody, but the longer you hang around the more you learn what's what and can talk to people
[2:13:41] <%Zeghart> Guns are very strong but bullets are rare and expensive
[2:13:42] <Mucmaster> A worn out revolver for 3000. Wow
[2:13:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, don't you have to go save a guy from death?
[2:14:04] <dukenux> If this was Kojima game the characters would explain everything and more than you wish by now
[2:14:04] <+CursedNobleman> @cyclosu0 thats where i struggle, why would i waste time with the game when i can read it or open it with infinity explorer. thats what i like about disco elysium. it doesnt make you do fake-combat for the engaging stuff
[2:14:12] <krymzen5> deep
[2:14:15] <thetruthofyourbeing> Hey chat, is rogue one worth watching? never got around to it and need something to watch.
[2:14:22] <MassConnect> no
[2:14:23] <dukenux> im gonna say nah
[2:14:25] <Mendin> Hungover hobos needing a drink of water, very Russian
[2:14:30] <%Zeghart> @thetruthofyourbeing It's ok
[2:14:32] <krymzen5> its meh, so no
[2:14:33] <SuperHoppedUp> I thought it was alright
[2:14:34] <$Zalthia> These guys are great
[2:14:39] <%JJnAJjohnson> Lmao this dude
[2:14:42] <+CursedNobleman> @thetruthofyourbeing watch the action parts on youtube LUL
[2:14:43] <dukenux> unless you really into SW its a pass
[2:14:44] <SuperHoppedUp> it's not any worse than the current batch
[2:14:49] <CrabSlacks> spicy air
[2:14:51] <omegadarknes> how much did i miss, i want ot know if it owuld be better to come back for the vod later
[2:14:52] <Angry_Ev1L> @thetruthofyourbeing depends it;s kinda meh and dumb but if you want to - go ahead
[2:14:55] <+TheBeachEpisode> doctor pat starting off strong
[2:14:57] <Mucmaster> Loot trash
[2:15:08] <Mendin> the Hobo Economy is a powerful market
[2:15:08] <sleepysquiddy> free garbage
[2:15:10] <+Javaa01> Always dumpster dive BTW, it's free money
[2:15:11] <$onlypuppet> It’s crazy, taking things for granted
[2:15:11] <thetruthofyourbeing> thanks guys
[2:15:11] <$Zalthia> There are some every few corners
[2:15:14] <Habblewater> once you find them they get marked
[2:15:26] <dukenux> its not bad but its not worthwile if youre not interested in backstory behind those Death Star plans
[2:15:28] <ElenaManetta> +5 RADS
[2:15:31] <herfaintsmile> LUL
[2:15:32] <SainEdge> @omegadarknes you mist the first hour, not too much
[2:15:37] <%Double_Tap_That> Hide yo kids, hide yo wifes
[2:15:40] <+cyclosu0> @CursedNobleman idk, thats probably why no one plays it anymore. Its old and janky but a great example of what the medium of vidya games can achieve. Pathologic 2 is better though, in every way.
[2:15:40] <pan_nochal> hide yo kids hide yo cow
[2:15:41] <LokimenD> Just like in real life
[2:15:41] <Habblewater> better get a move on
[2:15:47] <omegadarknes> tyty
[2:15:50] <Mendin> Bottled Water has a high trade value to Hobos
[2:15:51] <dukenux> Cause theyre stabbin everyone out therr
[2:15:52] <+TheBeachEpisode> that dialogue was implying that he'll trade items for water
[2:15:54] <britishtrex> you literally refused to help him pat
[2:15:59] <JumbleJams> hobos trade for water
[2:16:00] <%honeyman18> Twitter has passed hashtags of your misdeeds.
[2:16:02] <Habblewater> also stealth it up
[2:16:05] <%maxkur67> @AngriestPat IT WAS THE THING
[2:16:07] <pan_nochal> fuck no don't trade water
[2:16:07] <JumbleJams> maybe
[2:16:07] <lamash7u> @AngriestPat You may want to duck into back alleys and stealth your way around.
[2:16:09] <pantherpiss2> pat suspected killer 1 day in
[2:16:09] <%crazyspartan214> it keeps on getting worse
[2:16:12] <%maxkur67> The barter
[2:16:15] <%youthfulcrustacean> So what’s the deal with this game? I’m getting some dishonored vibes from it
[2:16:15] <Mendin> trade NPCs that aren't shops often deal in non-money currency
[2:16:20] <cutemuteprude> it's barely even started
[2:16:33] <grendius> @angriestpat you trade not just with money
[2:16:36] <%crazyspartan214> trust is too low to trade
[2:16:37] <%nofestu2> boner clay
[2:16:39] <+CursedNobleman> @pantherpiss2 lets upgrade from suspected to convicted, start haruspexing! SwiftRage
[2:16:47] <%Zeghart> @youthfulcrustacean It's a very odd game, hard to compare it to any other really, except Pathologic 1
[2:16:48] <pantherpiss2> LUL
[2:16:49] <JumbleJams> @youthfulcrustacean full on survival game with horror and philosophy basically
[2:16:56] <%Double_Tap_That> @youthfulcrustacean If you're expecting dishonoured, you'l be disappointed. It's closer to We Happy Few.
[2:16:56] <Manwad> skinwalkers NotLikeThis
[2:17:04] <SuperHoppedUp> it's it spoilers to ask if this game is magic or all just hallucinations?
[2:17:05] <%youthfulcrustacean> Oooh interressant
[2:17:13] <+CursedNobleman> @Double_Tap_That very astute. i like that comparison
[2:17:20] <$Zalthia> @SuperHoppedUp Some of it is, some of it isn't.
[2:17:21] <Habblewater> better run your ass raw daw
[2:17:21] <grendius> @superhoppedup neither
[2:17:27] <SuperHoppedUp> sweet
[2:17:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> Wait, did his trust go up because he talked to someone, Chat?
[2:17:29] <SuperHoppedUp> I like it
[2:17:29] <cutemuteprude> @superhoppedup It Depends (TM)
[2:17:32] <LokimenD> @SuperHoppedUp No, is very clearly all magic but only sometimes
[2:17:32] <JumbleJams> @SuperHoppedUp sort of
[2:17:34] <%Zeghart> @SuperHoppedUp There isn't really an answer to that tbh
[2:17:41] <grendius> @superhoppedup 'tis a theater
[2:17:44] <%nofestu2> baka
[2:17:46] <britishtrex> the game is a game that knows it's a game is all i'll say
[2:17:49] <$Zalthia> He was nice to them in dialouge so his rep went up a bit
[2:17:50] <JumbleJams> the the-a-ter
[2:17:53] <darkbotle> look at this city guy over here shitting on our clay women
[2:17:58] <%Double_Tap_That> They rimmom
[2:18:03] <Habblewater> marathon boys
[2:18:03] <+cyclosu0> khatanger.
[2:18:07] <%Double_Tap_That> *runnin
[2:18:08] <gluemanofficial> Man if I wanted to walk around and be hated by people I'd go outside more
[2:18:16] <+cyclosu0> such a fun word to say
[2:18:32] <$drfaustisdead> In this town of weirdos, losers, and monsters. Pat will ensure he's the biggest weirdo loser monster.
[2:18:32] <Kirlrik> it really says something that this feels more alien than 99% of scifi games
[2:18:32] <%youthfulcrustacean> Oh lawd they runnin
[2:18:39] <lamash7u> That's actually very important info.
[2:18:46] <britishtrex> 'don't be a bad person'
[2:18:50] <britishtrex> no way bruh
[2:19:08] <SuperHoppedUp> wtf
[2:19:11] <Mendin> Cow skulll
[2:19:12] <%cureneckbeard> T
[2:19:13] <artyom47> monkaS
[2:19:16] <+CursedNobleman> welp, they hate me, time to destroy the town LUL
[2:19:18] <$drfaustisdead> seems legit...
[2:19:22] <krymzen5> same
[2:19:27] <+ConLin_Arts_> WutFace
[2:19:34] <+MrRabbles> lady can bring her bones wherever she wants
[2:19:34] <MassConnect> stop saying bones. you'll summon paige
[2:19:34] <herfaintsmile> god what the fuck is this game lmao
[2:19:35] <+FalseEyeD> Bone Waifu
[2:19:39] <Hellarussian> Kojima you've done it again
[2:19:43] <%Double_Tap_That> Really wish this game had a steppe dictionary or something
[2:19:43] <+VerySevereLag> @angriestpat just got in, how you liking the game so far?
[2:19:46] <rytisone> Peach?
[2:19:47] <+Yakobro> LUL
[2:19:52] <natebud> YEAH I was going to recommend this game.
[2:19:55] <Panquake25> ye
[2:19:55] <%WheatlyXT> Why is his trust going down so hard?
[2:19:56] <pan_nochal> some of them, yes
[2:19:57] <lamash7u> Which means people who see you will try to beat your ass.
[2:19:57] <$Zalthia> Haaa haaaa haaaaa Pat
[2:19:57] <Meekest> You bet your ass
[2:19:57] <+Xevtes> yesd

[2:20:45] <britishtrex> the bachelor is such an asshole i love him
[2:20:48] <%honeyman18> Its captain Douchebag
[2:20:49] <+VerySevereLag> ayy it Daniil
[2:20:54] <%BinaryForest> @Bane_Kaikyo they heard about him killing the 3 guys in the intro and assume he killed his dad as well
[2:20:55] <+Daisoujoe> @Bane_Kaikyo A couple people have been killed in town the same day he arrived, rumors spreading
[2:21:05] <SuperHoppedUp> Hell russia man
[2:21:17] <+Elky3> chariG SoSnowy
[2:21:18] <SainEdge> @Bane_Kaikyo his father got murdered, he came back after years of living elsewhere and he killed 3 guys
[2:21:18] <+CursedNobleman> @Bane_Kaikyo hes a haruspex, a russian shaman that removes organs. the town thinks hes a murderer
[2:21:18] <JumbleJams> yeah, the bachelor!
[2:21:20] <+FalseEyeD> This guy looks normal. KILL HIM.
[2:21:25] <+ConLin_Arts_> watching Hbomberguy's video on the first game, is this one somewhat of a remake?
[2:21:25] <cutemuteprude> The Prickly Prick!
[2:21:33] <Mendin> @ConLin_Arts_ Yeah
[2:21:33] <JumbleJams> @ConLin_Arts_ yes
[2:21:34] <$Zalthia> It's a remake and a sequel
[2:21:39] <%ennui_on_me> It's an Evil Dead 2
[2:21:40] <+ConLin_Arts_> ah!
[2:21:43] <%Bane_Kaikyo> that's cool
[2:21:43] <+TheBeachEpisode> it's a reboot
[2:21:54] <%crazyspartan214> you took too long pat!
[2:21:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> Rebootquel
[2:21:58] <%ennui_on_me> I think calling it Pathologic 2 was a bad idea honestly
[2:21:59] <herfaintsmile> what a dick
[2:22:00] <+cyclosu0> borakh you dick!
[2:22:01] <%ennui_on_me> It's confusing
[2:22:05] <Panquake25> bachelor is such a fucl
[2:22:09] <%starotter70> wasn't the bachelor originally easy mode
[2:22:11] <CrabSlacks> this guy is such a chode
[2:22:11] <%Double_Tap_That> Pathologic 1.8 Final Chapter Remix
[2:22:14] <JumbleJams> he's a dick in the first game too LUL
[2:22:15] <pan_nochal> if you guys think THIS is him being a dick, you haven't seen shit
[2:22:16] <+Junkfist> You have my condolensces, Peasant.
[2:22:21] <$drfaustisdead> @TheBeachEpisode It's a reboot and sequel.
[2:22:21] <herfaintsmile> LUL
[2:22:24] <%BinaryForest> It's more like a film remake than a game remake. Calling it Pathologic 2 was a dumb call by the publisher though, the kickstarter was just called Pathologic again
[2:22:25] <+CursedNobleman> @starotter70 bach was easy mode in the OG, i think
[2:22:26] <kamayanna> LUL
[2:22:28] <AliceAstro> but he bishie tho
[2:22:30] <+Adryne> hes terrible. i love him
[2:22:35] <%honeyman18> Bachelor cause no one will put up with this Prick.
[2:22:35] <+neutral_guy> Don't worry Pat nobody likes the Bachelor in this town
[2:22:37] <black_pariah> huge asshole
[2:22:39] <+jepupu> What a pretentious asshole
[2:22:45] <Habblewater> Tell him to shut his dumb kickhole
[2:22:58] <$Zalthia> After you leave the house, go back inside to talk to him xD
[2:22:59] <%BinaryForest> The Bachelor rules and his route will be GOAT. You're gonna hate him from Burakh's perspective though cause he's the know it all city man
[2:23:06] <Habblewater> More like Bachelor of Farts, fuckin' dropkick
[2:23:10] <+MrRabbles> out of town dandy LUL
[2:23:10] <gluemanofficial> "Don't start fights. Also Rubin called you a bitch"
[2:23:12] <pan_nochal> search the cupboards in this room
[2:23:14] <CrabSlacks> if you want to look smart just quote random latin!
[2:23:22] <Mendin> Hahaha his plot web just called the bachelor "An out-of-town dandy"
[2:23:27] <MassConnect> just wait until he borrows your sega cd, pat
[2:23:31] <pan_nochal> there's more shit in there
[2:23:32] <SainEdge> @BinaryForest yeah it is weird. They probably didnt want to dissapoint fans, who expected a direct remake of the first one.
[2:23:32] <+timmc916> Hell yeah morphine!
[2:23:46] <$Zalthia> It's been 4 hours since you arrived in town
[2:23:46] <%starotter70> @angriestpat on a scale of 1 to 10 how much does thos game,do the anxoety for you?
[2:23:47] <BinaryBetrayer> Drugs, Drugs Drugs
[2:23:51] <+CursedNobleman> the bachelors favorite console is the SEGA Dreamcast LUL

[2:24:26] <+ConLin_Arts_> looks sassy
[2:24:30] <Fullmeatalvapire> at least they are't singing a creepy tune
[2:24:31] <bigbrothergannon> call Paige to punch children
[2:24:31] <SainEdge> it only gets worse. Im only 3 days in and oh boy, stuff happens LUL
[2:24:35] <natebud> This game tops Rule of Rose for shit kids.
[2:24:41] <BinaryBetrayer> All of the *** the same time.

[2:24:46] <CatmanIX> ggbrFattest3 ggbrFattest4
[2:24:47] <pantherpiss2> nice trap sounding quest
[2:24:55] <pan_nochal> this is why you might want to start running a lot
[2:25:02] <gluemanofficial> Everybody is fucking dying around here and it's only day 1
[2:25:05] <Habblewater> Local Urchins can get tae fuck
[2:25:05] <BinaryBetrayer> Run to the qest marker
[2:25:06] <pan_nochal> this is nothing btw, it's just day 1
[2:25:07] <%crazyspartan214> help the hobos
[2:25:07] <Mendin> I hear the mind-goblin drums, drums in the deep
[2:25:14] <+tussletoes> Pat Starves At more like
[2:25:16] <%Double_Tap_That> This game is meant to stress you out all the time. You never really have a moment to relax.
[2:25:31] <+CursedNobleman> Russian games are FUN! LUL
[2:25:35] <+TheBeachEpisode> I'd avoid main roads for now
[2:25:39] <%honeyman18> And don't forget your meters are always getting worse.
[2:25:40] <gekizenbu> cheeki breeki
[2:25:40] <Habblewater> Yeah, Pathologic 2 is brilliant and i fucking hate it
[2:25:43] <+neutral_guy> Remember this is just day 1 there are gonna be days where you won't be able to complete every side quest
[2:25:45] <+crook_fuji> those kids are seem look like some violent mafuckas
[2:25:55] <britishtrex> don't stray from the path, stick to the road
[2:26:01] <$Zalthia> hungaaaarrs
[2:26:04] <+toilet_chan> everything is always bad at all times
[2:26:07] <pan_nochal> if you follow the train tracks in the other direction you'll find some people to trade with
[2:26:08] <+Jaysky> Oh cool is this resource management the game?
[2:26:11] <+tussletoes> I dunno if the brain worms are prepared for having to fail eventually
[2:26:13] <Mendin> There's a reason people call this a russian misery simulator
[2:26:14] <BinaryBetrayer> Eveyrthing is bad within and without your character.
[2:26:14] <Futuretimetraveller> Good Ol' fashion Russian nihilism! <3
[2:26:15] <pan_nochal> they have food
[2:26:18] <grendius> Okay. Gotta head to bed. Good luck with the game @angriestpat and good night chat!
[2:26:20] <Manwad> eat pant
[2:26:21] <+cyclosu0> @Jaysky more than you can imagine.
[2:26:22] <%Double_Tap_That> Don't listen to chat, they're always wrong. Also, listen to chat, they're always right.
[2:26:25] <SuperHoppedUp> I'm gonna have to catch the vod for the rest of this
[2:26:25] <Treuan> Seems all roads lead to Gran Soren
[2:26:25] <CrabSlacks> swallow nuts
[2:26:26] <+Despera__> eat lots of food
[2:26:27] <ToneBacas> is this how russians see the world? no wonder they're literally throwing themselves in front of moving cars
[2:26:27] <SuperHoppedUp> enjoy the stress
[2:26:28] <Habblewater> Thirst seemed kinda managable tbh
[2:26:28] <+CursedNobleman> @grendius seeya boss!
[2:26:30] <$Zalthia> @toilet_chan There are some moments that things are okay, even good. Those are my favorite moments in the game.
[2:26:30] <%CappuccinoGuil> @neutral_guy so this is like This War of Mine where you can't win everything and just have to say "sorry, kids, your mother is going to die"?
[2:26:31] <SainEdge> just eat 4Head
[2:26:32] <Mendin> I can't wait for pat to encounter The Offer
[2:26:34] <+Jaysky> Delightful, this game sounds bad
[2:26:36] <Habblewater> shit kid zone
[2:26:39] <Angry_Ev1L> ONE GUY is always wrong but also ONE GUY is always right
[2:26:39] <herfaintsmile> this is very rule of rose
[2:26:42] <%BinaryForest> If a meter gets full it's not death, it'll just start draining your health instead
[2:26:43] <+tussletoes> Haha thirst is manageable for now
[2:26:46] <+ConLin_Arts_> oh boi
[2:26:47] <+Arsimckhoi> is he playing the DLC too?
[2:26:52] <%BinaryForest> Except Immunity. That's...different
[2:26:53] <+cyclosu0> @Jaysky yeah probably not for you.
[2:26:55] <%ennui_on_me> This is straight-up just Satantango
[2:26:59] <SainEdge> doggies FeelsBadMan
[2:27:00] <Mendin> watch out for a pupper snuffer
[2:27:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Kill the children Pat LUL
[2:27:01] <+ConLin_Arts_> just got to this part of Hbomberguys video
[2:27:12] <black_pariah> hbomberguy called this a pain simulator
[2:27:12] <%dalmek> culplit
[2:27:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> CULPLIT?
[2:27:14] <+FalseEyeD> Call Plit
[2:27:19] <Angry_Ev1L> imagine thinking this fucking masterpiece is bad LUL
[2:27:24] <Habblewater> oh boy this bit
[2:27:29] <AliceAstro> fuuuuuck
[2:27:29] <+timmc916> Pat cant do mouth word
[2:27:29] <+neutral_guy> @CappuccinoGuil Kinda some side quests may not even be worth doing
[2:27:35] <Snirtax> hbomberguy stole half his review from mandalore
[2:27:37] <+Jaysky> Likely not. But I ain't against watching someone struggle with it
[2:27:38] <gluemanofficial> Wait are you helping these kids decide which one of them needs to die for their crimes?
[2:27:42] <gluemanofficial> Awesome
[2:27:50] <$Zalthia> Yes that is what's happening
[2:27:54] <Ipsenscastle> I'm struggling to understand the appeal, someone explain and sell me on this game please
[2:27:55] <%Double_Tap_That> These are good choices
[2:27:57] <pantherpiss2> SeemsGood murder
[2:28:03] <+Daisoujoe> @gluemanofficial Pathologic 1 straight up asked you to kill a kid and rewarded you super well if you did
[2:28:12] <$Zalthia> Talk again
[2:28:16] <ToneBacas> the good end
[2:28:17] <+ConLin_Arts_> You are dying of everything and you try to survive
[2:28:18] <pantherpiss2> you were tried
[2:28:20] <%dalmek> "Is killing okay" "Yeah" "Cool not guilty bye"
[2:28:21] <ToneBacas> i mean no idea really
[2:28:21] <herfaintsmile> you win!!
[2:28:23] <+tussletoes> oh boy
[2:28:28] <krymzen5> oh
[2:28:30] <kamayanna> You just told a kid it's okay to murder
[2:28:32] <Psyramics> you not getting murdered sounds like a win to me
[2:28:39] <+Daisoujoe> @Ipsenscastle It's basically helplessness the game. Struggling against an impossible situation while everyone dies around you.
[2:28:41] <+cyclosu0> lol
[2:28:51] <Pechugaman> The kids need to learnfrom an early age that killing is alright
[2:28:51] <Slim_Lipid> Spanked shedGasm
[2:29:01] <Ipsenscastle> @Daisoujoe eesh
[2:29:12] <+MrRabbles> her name is catnip

[2:29:36] <+cyclosu0> no
[2:29:36] <ambadev> Pat pls
[2:29:38] <%ennui_on_me> There is a spectrum of polarizing niche video games that I love but totally get hating. On one end is God Hand, on the other is this.
[2:29:38] <pan_nochal> he might survive
[2:29:42] <cutemuteprude> om nom nom
[2:29:45] <KoryMccool> now your playing the video game
[2:29:45] <%ennui_on_me> This is the nega-God Hand
[2:29:47] <Mucmaster> Eat before drinking
[2:29:53] <Angry_Ev1L> @Zalthia nice spoiler
[2:29:53] <+MrRabbles> it would have been culturally insensitive for him not to take it
[2:29:57] <%honeyman18> "milk"
[2:29:57] <AliceAstro> delicious morphine
[2:29:58] <+TheBeachEpisode> chugging it right in front of her
[2:30:01] <%Double_Tap_That> Whole milk, good for your bones
[2:30:03] <HeroSolaire> doesn't matter, he gets plenty of free water first day
[2:30:13] <%WhereIsWill> These just pats offspring? It's ginger madness in here!
[2:30:15] <SolverCODO> muthers milk
[2:30:15] <antary> eat a сухарь
[2:30:19] <$Zalthia> @Angry_Ev1L It's a totally optional, not marked, thing. It's super easy to miss.
[2:30:26] <+tussletoes> trust me, water... becomes a problem. soon
[2:30:35] <$Zalthia> @Angry_Ev1L but, sorry.
[2:30:37] <%Noelle_wasLunaAshford> Thank you twitch for eating my sub message again
[2:30:58] <+Dr_Mooose> weird
[2:31:05] <Kirlrik> idk what soul-and-a-half is but that sounds dope
[2:31:13] <pan_nochal> Pat is so lost LUL
[2:31:16] <Angry_Ev1L> @Zalthia xxxSHH
[2:31:17] <Habblewater> Think about it, you told the kids it's okay to kill, they don't like him, and he's your only witness
[2:31:19] <%Noelle_wasLunaAshford> Its been eating my messages for months now
[2:31:20] <+Big_Bossuru> this game is horny
[2:31:26] <black_pariah> MIND GOBLINS
[2:31:27] <kamayanna> soul-and-a-halves are a very good kid gang, I would've joined that kid gang
[2:31:31] <%honeyman18> Feel the Anxiety Pat
[2:31:32] <Mendin> Pat it's only 10:20am
[2:31:34] <Mendin> in town
[2:31:34] <+neutral_guy> And in the first game you first proper objective was to MURDER that kid
[2:31:34] <%nofestu2> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[2:31:36] <krymzen5> u need him tho
[2:31:37] <+tussletoes> this game is horny to see you fail
[2:31:38] <Mendin> And you have all this
[2:31:40] <$onlypuppet> What happened? I was collecting offerings
[2:31:43] <+Daisoujoe> They have an extra half soul
[2:31:53] <Mendin> I think their doggos are their extra
[2:32:11] <Habblewater> Though i picked this option too
[2:32:19] <Mendin> Pat you're Big Hungry
[2:32:25] <deadbrainpl> Oh boy, Pat is either going to have the EASIEST time or the WORST time playing his game due to his child-stabbing tendencies huh?
[2:32:31] <$onlypuppet> Oh yes, we don’t want any hounds going hungry
[2:32:37] <%LymanAl> He's big tired
[2:32:38] <$Zalthia> puppos
[2:32:42] <Mendin> Oh right that's hunger not satiety
[2:32:45] <%Double_Tap_That> @AngriestPat You're usually not going to be able accomplish all your tasks in a given day, so don't worry about all the different threads. Just focus on one at a time.
[2:32:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hongry boi
[2:32:47] <%honeyman18> You're gonna leash a furry kid?
[2:32:49] <%BinaryForest> You know I think Pat will deal with this game better than most people. Usually players have trouble surviving because they want to save and help everyone, whereas Pat has the "fuck you give me food" approach that you need
[2:32:52] <Mendin> I became That One Guy, shit
[2:32:53] <Habblewater> Freakass?
[2:32:55] <Angry_Ev1L> Pat already barely can handle this LUL
[2:32:56] <+Javaa01> Starvation is a part of the process, so long as you don't die, it's fine
[2:32:59] <+tussletoes> Pat likes throwing kids under the bus? that's this whole game.
[2:33:09] <AliceAstro> stone'enge
[2:33:13] <Angry_Ev1L> can you eat children tho
[2:33:17] <%dalmek> I don't like that phrasing
[2:33:24] <Habblewater> Oh no i remember
[2:33:27] <%ennui_on_me> wow, this place must have a shit ton of chiral crystals
[2:33:28] <$onlypuppet> It’s easier to understand once you’ve lived it
[2:33:29] <$Zalthia> I saw a kid T pose over a corpse in this game it was amazing.
[2:33:30] <Mendin> Use the NPC-O-Vision?
[2:33:31] <Habblewater> he's there pat it's just fucking annoying
[2:33:34] <%BinaryForest> He's behind a rock on the edge, it's hard ot see
[2:33:36] <DagetStreams> I like that, I'm gonna start using assfreak more in conversation
[2:33:37] <gluemanofficial> I guess that one guy isn't going to get any more stabbed
[2:33:37] <black_pariah> Pat's going to take to this better than i expected
[2:33:45] <Mucmaster> You know no-one will see you if you just murder this kid. You can totally get away with it kappa
[2:33:46] <HeroSolaire> He spawns if you drop the leash
[2:33:50] <+tussletoes> he's around there
[2:33:59] <DefaultSettiings> she has four eyes
[2:34:17] <SainEdge> i remember searching for him for a while LUL
[2:34:28] <$drfaustisdead> Assfreak was the less successful spinoff of Mindfreak.
[2:34:30] <pan_nochal> nice job fucking up there Pat
[2:34:37] <%nofestu2> bless you
[2:34:40] <+tussletoes> it is done
[2:34:40] <+Daisoujoe> Every decision in this game is fucking up
[2:34:42] <Mendin> Nice big manly sneeze
[2:34:43] <Sokumotanaka> OH SHIT it's watchdog man!
[2:34:45] <+cyclosu0> f

[2:34:48] <pantherpiss2> child killer trait monkaS
[2:34:49] <%BinaryForest> Now go back to Notkin
[2:34:54] <natebud> Mistake 1
[2:34:57] <+MrRabbles> man loses last shred of reputation he didn't even know he had
[2:35:00] <Tucker0603> DONT HURT PUPPERS
[2:35:06] <+Junkfist> Kill a child
[2:35:10] <Ninjalettuce> STAB
[2:35:16] <sadambober> LUL
[2:35:18] <$Zalthia> Are their puppers even real though?
[2:35:20] <Angry_Ev1L> LUL it's also funny cause it's true
[2:35:22] <%Double_Tap_That> Lies, there are no bad decisions, only different ones. Maybe.
[2:35:23] <$Zalthia> I never see them
[2:35:28] <%Chichen> agreed
[2:35:29] <BinaryBetrayer> Don't actually kill kids though
[2:35:36] <Habblewater> This one isn't a bad choice i reckon
[2:35:37] <+Daisoujoe> @Double_Tap_That Well, there is exactly one bad decision
[2:35:40] <Panquake25> Pat "Child Killer" Boivin
[2:35:41] <%honeyman18> How you think he made his Fur Suit?
[2:35:42] <RunningNGunning> What if he's into chokejerking and hanging him is exactly what he wants?
[2:35:42] <Angry_Ev1L> actually kill kids tho
[2:35:42] <rytisone> Pat no
[2:35:43] <%Double_Tap_That> Quote that
[2:35:44] <+tussletoes> boss, you killed a child... amazing! mission complete. that right there is why you're the best, boss
[2:35:44] <+timmc916> theyre orphans, who cares?
[2:35:44] <Mucmaster> You actually get a super good item if you kill the kid though
[2:35:45] <DagetStreams> Amazing! That right there is why you're the best, Boss!
[2:35:46] <gluemanofficial> Those other kids will do the killing. Pat just helped. He's totally blameless!
[2:35:47] <%ennui_on_me> There are two kinds of decisions in Pathologic. Bad ones and worse ones.
[2:35:48] <pan_nochal> nothing can stop you aside from CONSTANT THIRST
[2:35:51] <%crazyspartan214> kick'em in the gonards
[2:35:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> we can kill guilty children
[2:36:02] <+Junkfist> Bumfights but with kids
[2:36:06] <rasmus206060> LUL
[2:36:08] <+ConLin_Arts_> there don't seem to be good or bad choices, just moral ones that either benefit you or not
[2:36:10] <FrankysDream> this game is making me so uncomfortable
[2:36:11] <+Daisoujoe> @Double_Tap_That But it'll be a little while before we start considering any deals
[2:36:24] <pan_nochal> oh, you still got the leash
[2:36:25] <pan_nochal> nevermind
[2:36:30] <+tussletoes> that kid might have been better off dying
[2:36:36] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat hurt the PUPPERS, you get the snuffer
[2:36:52] <natebud> In the original, the mission as to just straight up murder that kid.
[2:36:52] <Angry_Ev1L> well that doesn't sound ominous at all

[2:38:27] <Meekest> Welcome to Pathologic
[2:38:28] <+Daisoujoe> @goomba334 Did you see the beginning? It's intentionally theatrical
[2:38:31] <+Javaa01> Good
[2:38:31] <JayEarly> @goomba334 Russia, that’s whats up
[2:38:32] <natebud> You haven't seen nothing yet

[2:38:38] <pan_nochal> follow the train tracks
[2:38:38] <gluemanofficial> These names are awesome. We should make everybody change their names to things like "Bad Faith" and "Whistler"

[2:38:43] <+MrRabbles> this is only day 1
[2:38:45] <+timmc916> even the mind goblins get tired of running rampant it seems
[2:38:48] <garagon31> Welcome to the Pathologic experienc
[2:38:49] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @goomba334 @Daisoujoe it sounds shitty not theatrical
[2:38:49] <%CalderGaming> as intended
[2:38:55] <$onlypuppet> So young, and already we’re trying to snuff out the life
[2:38:56] <+FalseEyeD> European / Russian games just use their Alpha UI.
[2:38:56] <Mendin> Pat you arrived at town at like 8am in-game-time, and it's like 11 or 12 now
[2:38:59] <+Raidou24> This is just day 1
[2:39:01] <%maxkur67> @AngriestPat Welcome to Ice-Pick Lodge games :D
[2:39:02] <Mendin> You have covered so little time yet
[2:39:02] <blackesteagle> nice lighting

[2:39:28] <+ClaudeMcGarren> art? LUL
[2:39:33] <natebud> Trade
[2:39:34] <+neutral_guy> @AngriestPat Consider taking a boat then its basically "fast travel"
[2:39:34] <%BinaryForest> Did...did he take any meat?
[2:39:35] <Nero270> Exhausted in a good way, or a bad way? @AngriestPat
[2:39:36] <+Raidou24> Anixety only goes up from here
[2:39:38] <pan_nochal> you might want to trade for all this meat, cough, cough
[2:39:41] <Habblewater> You gotta give them 4 handshakes for the meat though
[2:39:43] <natebud> He did not take any meat
[2:39:44] <$Zalthia> trade with him to get meat
[2:39:49] <BinaryBetrayer> RIP Pat
[2:39:50] <+Javaa01> You gotta buy the meat
[2:39:52] <Mendin> Pat you gotta learn the hobbo eoconomy
[2:39:54] <$Zalthia> aw rip
[2:39:55] <+Daisoujoe> @ClaudeMcGarren One of these days things will get better for you and you'll release a bit of this meaningless hostility. Until then, hang in there
[2:39:56] <%BinaryForest> Well he did say "Show me the meat" not "give it to me"
[2:39:58] <amused_platypus> quick question what is the setting of the game?
[2:40:00] <natebud> Trade
[2:40:01] <%Double_Tap_That> oh NO
[2:40:02] <%BinaryForest> It doesn't cost money
[2:40:03] <+Javaa01> Food gets more expensive
[2:40:03] <NegaScottsuper> Why is there a Pink Floyd Reference at the Factory?
[2:40:03] <Mendin> They don't trade in money
[2:40:04] <Habblewater> No meal for old beal
[2:40:05] <pan_nochal> trading isn't spending money
[2:40:06] <+griffball13> what if he needs it later
[2:40:08] <%honeyman18> Tell him to smoke your meat, that'll get him
[2:40:14] <+MrRabbles> it wasn't worth money it was barter
[2:40:14] <natebud> Pat you will die, if you aren't constantly trading
[2:40:14] <%BinaryForest> Stores take money, peopel barter goods. That's where you use your trash
[2:40:14] <kamayanna> This is set in a small rural Russian town
[2:40:17] <Mucmaster> Don't forget to loot garbage
[2:40:17] <pan_nochal> nu uh
[2:40:21] <+cyclosu0> @amused_platypus backwater russian town
[2:40:21] <%LymanAl> Not always
[2:40:23] <BinaryBetrayer> The Hobo economy will trigger Pat in so many ways.
[2:40:24] <Mendin> SHOPPING is spending money. Trading is items for items
[2:40:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> person
[2:40:28] <+neutral_guy> Some people don't want money they want certain items for their stuff
[2:40:28] <%maxkur67> @amused_platypus weird mix of steppe and industrial time lost in time & space. Literally
[2:40:29] <Habblewater> trading is trading, not money exchange
[2:40:30] <Mucmaster> Garbage is needed in the hobo economy
[2:40:33] <$Zalthia> money is different than bartering
[2:40:34] <Habblewater> handshakes instead of orbs
[2:40:37] <%maxkur67> *town

[2:45:08] <Habblewater> I was expecting you to cut out his brain
[2:45:08] <JumbleJams> don't

[2:45:12] <Mendin> They do keep mentioning that Cutting People Is A Bad
[2:45:13] <%BinaryForest> By "knock a man out and take his heart" standards, maybe no
[2:45:13] <BinaryBetrayer> Don't
[2:45:14] <gluemanofficial> Bad for the guy? Yes
[2:45:14] <natebud> Congrats. ALL people attack on sight now.

[2:45:53] <$drfaustisdead> Pat's refining his child murder tech.
[2:45:57] <%honeyman18> Basically doing surgery with a rusty butterknive.
[2:45:58] <+keyoray> its a bb
[2:46:00] <%Bane_Kaikyo> this game looks cool
[2:46:00] <pan_nochal> admire the kidney
[2:46:04] <+cyclosu0> sleep
[2:46:05] <comfyakerman> wow kidney sure does look like a baby
[2:46:07] <korth367> eat the heart
[2:46:11] <+Slingnasty> Missed the part where he got stabbed for killing a woman
[2:46:16] <%honeyman18> Medicine Only
[2:46:21] <ranarath> Who the hell is this?!
[2:46:22] <Mucmaster> Someone in the chat. Does Morphine heal?
[2:46:26] <ElenaManetta> Having the words THEY'LL KNOW show up when you're going to do something illegal in front of someone is way scarier sounding than GUARDS NEARBY or whatever
[2:46:32] <fuzz9369> so is this game good?
[2:46:41] <natebud> This game is great
[2:46:42] <megakruemel> I thought mindgoblins were shorter
[2:46:43] <BinaryBetrayer> Mime looking after number 1
[2:46:47] <%Lambda_man> @fuzz9369 yes, but not for everyone
[2:46:48] <Kirlrik> morphine is more effective before sleeping i think
[2:46:48] <+Despera__> GOTY matrerial
[2:46:52] <Mucmaster> @fuzz9369 Yes. Might not be fun though
[2:46:53] <%ennui_on_me> this game is great at doing something very niche
[2:46:53] <BinaryBetrayer> Just Id it up, pat
[2:46:54] <Habblewater> This game is fantastic but not enjoyable
[2:46:57] <Angry_Ev1L> this game is brilliant
[2:46:58] <ElenaManetta> just like IRL
[2:47:00] <+Daisoujoe> @fuzz9369 Fantastic, but you have to be into a game that is intentionally trying to make you squirm, including through gameplay
[2:47:01] <%Lambda_man> @fuzz9369 high likelyhood of bouncjng off
[2:47:06] <gluemanofficial> Somebody get mask guy some less tight pants
[2:47:07] <$onlypuppet> The time keeps changing, praise the moon
[2:47:10] <fuzz9369> thanks guys, I'll keep watching
[2:47:11] <kamayanna> Or even if you AREN'T desperate!
[2:47:18] <+neutral_guy> Gotta get both things in the red @AngriestPat
[2:47:21] <Habblewater> both at the same time
[2:47:22] <pan_nochal> align both at the same time
[2:47:23] <SainEdge> @fuzz9369 yes, but it is a very special type of game. If you are unsure, watch the reviews by mandalore gaming
[2:47:24] <+cyclosu0> match both the reds
[2:47:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> get in red?
[2:47:30] <natebud> Both sides red
[2:47:30] <%BinaryForest> Get both into red at the same time
[2:47:31] <BinaryBetrayer> Match both reds
[2:47:33] <%maxkur67> @AngriestPat keep both in red
[2:47:34] <ElenaManetta> Oh I get it
[2:47:37] <ElenaManetta> That looks awkward as heck
[2:47:38] <%BinaryForest> Black drains it the fastest
[2:47:41] <%honeyman18> Painful and shitty is what it is
[2:47:42] <+keyoray> weird,
[2:47:46] <ElenaManetta> Oh you dont have to keep clicking the triggers?
[2:47:48] <+HorribleHog> It's simple and neat
[2:47:49] <+keyoray> no tutorials?
[2:47:53] <ElenaManetta> I thought you had to balance the triggers to get it in the red
[2:47:59] <%BinaryForest> Fyi time passes when looting, which is why lockpicking and opening shelves takes time
[2:48:20] <$onlypuppet> Lock picking is almost like an art, gross
[2:48:32] <BinaryBetrayer> He's gonna get firing squadded so bad
[2:48:35] <Mendin> So remember how the kids offered to ttrade you needles for blades?
[2:48:36] <pan_nochal> time is ticking
[2:48:38] <%honeyman18> STEAL THE EGGS PAT
[2:48:39] <natebud> EVERY item has value.

[2:49:06] <%honeyman18> Only medicine heals
[2:49:15] <pan_nochal> playing this with a pad is straight up masochistic

[2:49:19] <%Double_Tap_That> Save that
[2:49:22] <sakeydo> id love if someone was still in the room
[2:49:23] <natebud> game does not pause while looting btw
[2:49:25] <comfyakerman> a dead item for a dead man
[2:49:36] <fuzz9369> what's the elevator pitch for this game? , didn't get the tone so far
[2:49:49] <%DomPressesButtons> DomPressesButtons subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[2:49:50] <%DomPressesButtons> DomPressesButtons's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat!

[2:50:04] <$onlypuppet> Don’t worry, there are eyes everywhere
[2:50:10] <comfyakerman> >elevator pitch you are done for and everything is suffering
[2:50:12] <britishtrex> you love to see it
[2:50:19] <Mendin> I can HEAR pat starting to sweat profusely at th is game
[2:50:22] <$jacob2pop> Kids especially love them in their candy
[2:50:25] <pan_nochal> @fuzz9369 you're in a very rural and remote russian town with a specific culture and shit goes very bad very fast, try to survive and save other people
[2:50:27] <natebud> The plague hasnt even started yet LUL
[2:50:27] <+keyoray> this sounds terrible (and wonderful?)
[2:50:28] <+Daisoujoe> @fuzz9369 It's about trying to save a town during the plague (takes a little time to show up) while barely having the resources available to even keep yourself from getting it, and important people WILL die and you can only fight to put off the inevitable.
[2:50:37] <nawadap136> @fuzz9369 Survival Russian Depression Fever Dream 2: Apocalyptic Boogaloo
[2:50:49] <%Double_Tap_That> Trust me, the combat music is stressful enough that you can tell when it starts.
[2:51:00] <ElenaManetta> is that breathing pat or the game
[2:51:02] <Mendin> If you want to hear a big dissertation on the original version of this game, HBomberGuy just did a video a week or two ago
[2:51:03] <BinaryBetrayer> Sell needles to the kids, become the thing you're afraid of.
[2:51:05] <natebud> Every district has a different ambient soundtrack
[2:51:06] <kamayanna> Gotta save run energy for murder men
[2:51:07] <+keyoray> is that water being treated?
[2:51:07] <fuzz9369> oh damn,thet sound really original
[2:51:12] <mrblack499> pat is doomed
[2:51:12] <Nanomachiner> stay hydrated

[2:51:39] <%Double_Tap_That> "You're Hated Here" sounds like most places I go
[2:51:42] <Mendin> Pat, Day 1 of this game is like the Central Knot City map of Death Stranding
[2:51:43] <JumbleJams> hot pursuit!
[2:51:44] <+TheBeachEpisode> i'm glad you really quickly learned that combat is to be avoided at all costs
[2:51:45] <$Zalthia> I had to go for a sec did Pat murder anyone else?
[2:51:45] <%BinaryForest> If you're hated they attack you, if you're cool then they'll help you against thugs
[2:51:46] <$jacob2pop> Came to the wrong neighborhood

[2:55:06] <Slim_Lipid> It's Depression :)

[2:55:16] <natebud> drop fish
[2:55:17] <JumbleJams> its on the floor
[2:55:18] <gluemanofficial> I think the least realistic thing about games like this is that you never just sleep on the floor
[2:55:18] <Mendin> Look down
[2:55:20] <Mucmaster> fish on ground
[2:55:23] <Psyramics> do you leave the lights on in every room of your house at all times?
[2:55:29] <SainEdge> we all know the feeling when your pockets are so full because of all the organs we carry around LUL
[2:55:35] <pan_nochal> noif

[2:55:36] <%BinaryForest> Sorry you can't fit the fish in your inventory, you have too many STOLEN ORGANS
[2:55:40] <Mucmaster> Eat bread
[2:55:43] <$Zalthia> tick. tock. tick. tock.
[2:55:44] <+timmc916> "you smell like blood" (hides multiple organs he harvested) "idk man"
[2:55:48] <JumbleJams> @AngriestPat remember things drop if you have no room, might miss an important item
[2:55:49] <%honeyman18> Having a full inventory leaves shit on the ground in a sack.
[2:55:56] <joylent_blue> i can't carry this knife AND this liver!
[2:55:57] <Mendin> -Lana opens her fish cupboard, finds fresh human organs in it-
[2:55:58] <%BinaryForest> I think you can store items in these cabinets until you have a better storage area
[2:55:59] <Mucmaster> Organs are very valuable
[2:56:03] <LokimenD> Pat is carrying too many organs
[2:56:03] <SomersaultJustice> did he defeat the pathologic as well yet?
[2:56:04] <%Double_Tap_That> Attache case 3.0
[2:56:05] <ranarath> What can he even do with the organs?

[2:59:28] <+Daisoujoe> @DaBigVitus The guy he is playing came back home summoned by his father, found out a few people died and things are turning bad in town. Most of the confusing stuff is worldbuilding that'll make sense over time

[3:13:23] <dukenux> The Game Won
[3:13:24] <Deimos002> I dunno, wasn't paying attention
[3:13:25] <%Typhaeon> Closer to the latter
[3:13:25] <based_versauen> das the litter box scratch
[3:13:25] <%Agami23> yeah
[3:13:27] <gluemanofficial> See if the podcast can get sponsored by a first aid company and cure your infection live on twitch
[3:13:28] <JustChoppa> no talk
[3:13:28] <%starotter70> Talking, is a strong wor
[3:13:28] <+altairibnlaahad909> altairibnlaahad909 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Aww Pat couldn't take the Pathologic heat
[3:13:29] <JumbleJams> that's the brain space
[3:13:29] <+keyoray> Not really talking, mumbling
[3:13:29] <+altairibnlaahad909> altairibnlaahad909's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[3:13:29] <%Chichen> I barely understood what the fuck i was watchingtbh
[3:13:29] <Mendin> You were just barely keeping from a breakdown
[3:13:35] <%honeyman18> Minut Speak occured
[3:13:36] <+cyclosu0> yeah, its not a good stream game
[3:13:39] <%Agami23> this game seems very not for you.
[3:13:41] <+cyclosu0> but its a great game
[3:13:42] <TheBlankAce> A step up from minit talk
[3:13:42] <%starotter70> No speak, just time
[3:13:43] <%Typhaeon> You became Baba
[3:13:43] <pan_nochal> @AngriestPat you probably talked about RE3 already but talk about it more
[3:13:46] <Frostydough1> is that a good or bad thing i wasnt here for the game
[3:13:46] <$Zalthia> It’s not a stream game
[3:13:46] <Gruntini> i aint gonna lie i kinda blanked out
[3:13:48] <%ennui_on_me> It's a good game to stream once and never again
[3:13:49] <Nanomachiner> welp rip
[3:13:51] <%Double_Tap_That> Yup
[3:13:52] <Angry_Ev1L> shut up
[3:13:52] <nawadap136> so thats what Russians are like all the time it seems
[3:13:53] <dukenux> You were really stressed out
[3:13:54] <natebud> Turning in that surgery mission, unlocked the guy you sell organs to also.
[3:13:56] <%starotter70> Again, very fair
[3:13:56] <based_versauen> when's observation? @AngriestPat
[3:13:58] <$onlypuppet> Came home and took a massive shit :(
[3:13:59] <%WhereIsWill> you went into a trace once you got the knife lmao
[3:14:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah its a Disco Elysuim
[3:14:03] <Mendin> It also might not be a very good pat game
[3:14:03] <%ThatOneGameTester> i enjoyed you playing it
[3:14:04] <artyom47> Yeah i had the same thing i love this game but it makes me so tense
[3:14:06] <gluemanofficial> You started running around and stabbing children. I thought it was normal Pat behavior at first
[3:14:10] <Gruntini> yes
[3:14:12] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat I'm not gonna miss it to be honest
[3:14:13] <+daimaza> no
[3:14:14] <%starotter70> Oh?
[3:14:19] <CrabSlacks> it's a lot to handle all at once and only gets worse
[3:14:21] <dukenux> i respectfully disagree, but i get why you dont feel like doing it
[3:14:25] <Guardiansaiyan> we haven't STUDIED!!!
[3:14:27] <altairibnlaahad909> @AngriestPat Pathologic is probably one of the greatest games ever made and is absolutely a great game to experience but probably not a great game to stream
[3:14:29] <%WhereIsWill> once you got the knife and saw the children it was over
[3:14:32] <TwinBat> scratches make the heart grow fonder
[3:14:38] <+daimaza> fuck video games
[3:14:40] <$Zalthia> I have nearly 60 hours on this game and hav me only ever gotten to day 4
[3:14:44] <Manwad> seems like a game to play with 2 sets of eyes, one for loot, one for plot
[3:14:46] <Angry_Ev1L> EVERY GAME IS GREAT GAME TO STREAM cowards
[3:14:51] <rytisone> get a better computer Kappa

[3:15:31] <Gruntini> @AngriestPat It runs well unless you turn on x8 Antialiasing
[3:15:32] <CrabSlacks> 106 gigs of wasted space
[3:15:33] <ElenaManetta> holy shit i forgot about those wild horse moment

[3:17:06] <Angry_Ev1L> 2080ti is a meme

[3:17:26] <pan_nochal> is cool
[3:17:28] <%HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat is Buscemi falling over
[3:17:30] <Mendin> His brain's still recovering from the Patho
[3:17:41] <joylent_blue> when's Teppen
[3:17:43] <%WhereIsWill> what you think about the new Jill tho!
[3:17:55] <Habblewater> He's Patholethargic
[3:17:59] <ElenaManetta> I bet if you even touch that picture, a fleet of insects who have taken shelter behind it will just scatter
[3:18:03] <dukenux> Im okay with new Jill as long as we get a tubetop alt
[3:18:06] <pan_nochal> what about Nemesis' botched rhinoplasty
[3:18:13] <%starotter70> It's gonna be an extra costume anyway
[3:18:13] <Angry_Ev1L> really?
[3:18:14] <%Dr_DangerPhD> the tubetop was fucking outrageous, glad its gone
[3:18:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Carlos looks like Yakuza 7 protag LUL
[3:18:20] <jaid251> New model for sfm
[3:18:22] <dukenux> Do you dig Nemesis' new look Kappa
[3:18:22] <%WhereIsWill> I'm sure we'll get alt costumes for dayz
[3:18:24] <rytisone> hope Carlos and Jill flirt like Leon and Claire
[3:18:25] <%CalderGaming> nothing worse than a sagging Buscemi
[3:18:26] <$onlypuppet> The scientist?

[3:18:53] <%WhereIsWill> LUL
[3:18:55] <+hmgirlpopuri> That would make Pat look like he's in the Fallout 76 power armor bug
[3:19:03] <ElenaManetta> Make it so the head is on the belly button area
[3:19:03] <RootVeggie> Why isn't this called Patologic 2?
[3:19:07] <gluemanofficial> Why not just make a shirt where half of it looks like your pants
[3:19:07] <ElenaManetta> so its a head with legs
[3:19:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:19:09] <%driemen> did I show up at stream over

[3:19:38] <gluemanofficial> Pathologic 2 Protip 1: Reset your game
[3:19:40] <pan_nochal> everyone who reviews the game got fucked up somehow

[3:19:54] <Angry_Ev1L> FIGURE IT OUT
[3:19:55] <pan_nochal> Russian magic
[3:19:55] <Zepper202> It's that people who review the game suffer an injury some how
[3:19:56] <%GwatchaSquatcha> @AngriestPat is the new elite controller?
[3:19:56] <ToneBacas> i wanna watch that review right now
[3:19:57] <%Typhaeon> Did you read the ancient Let's Play of Pathologic from Something Awful?

[3:19:58] <natebud> mandalore was fine

[3:20:10] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[3:20:12] <%HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat you are going to be cursed and get even shorter
[3:20:12] <Dementedpenguin> That's.... genuinely worrying.
[3:20:13] <Guardiansaiyan> if you review the game you might get taller @AngriestPat
[3:20:20] <Mendin> @Typhaeon Like two of the three LPs of that had all their pictures destroy off the internet
[3:20:22] <%WheatlyXT> And now YOU are next for looking at it
[3:20:22] <Zepper202> It's a legit curse, it's happened to a few people
[3:20:23] <pan_nochal> fucking how
[3:20:27] <Frostydough1> Pat can't break his dick, Paige will literally die
[3:20:28] <KoryMccool> what
[3:20:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> STAR WARS?
[3:20:31] <nikoloas_> they're good
[3:20:34] <%Typhaeon> @Mendin Is that LP archive site not up anymore? They were there
[3:20:35] <Gruntini> His reviews are the best
[3:20:38] <$onlypuppet> I wonder what the Moomins are doing
[3:20:39] <Zepper202> Mandalore's great
[3:20:41] <+XxBTExX> his appearance in THE MANDALORIAN [/joke]
[3:20:42] <T_Sasquatch> He does good shut
[3:20:43] <%driemen> Check out grimbeard though
[3:20:44] <$Chimeraelite> Mandalore and SSeth are quality
[3:20:47] <Gruntini> Also go watch Kreal Tube!
[3:20:48] <%driemen> now there's some nonsense
[3:20:49] <KoryMccool> Mandelore is legit
[3:20:50] <gluemanofficial> Mandalore is cool. I'm just mad he sold out to be on disney+
[3:20:54] <+Junkfist> hey people
[3:21:00] <JumbleJams> yes
[3:21:03] <Zepper202> Pretty much yeah
[3:21:04] <Angry_Ev1L> yeah
[3:21:07] <Gruntini> ye
[3:21:07] <pan_nochal> Pathologic 2 is great once you get into it though, no joke
[3:21:11] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Hey hey people
[3:21:11] <Manwad> mandolore, then hbomber
[3:21:11] <$onlypuppet> I like deconstructions
[3:21:13] <KoryMccool> Wanna say Mandelore the mosrt
[3:21:14] <%honeyman18> Seems so
[3:21:15] <JumbleJams> it's the good fucked
[3:21:15] <+MrRabbles> ice pick lodge retweeted their videos even
[3:21:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Fucked in a good way
[3:21:20] <%ennui_on_me> Yeah, it's a huge cult thing that I had heard a lot about but they definitely expanded its reach
[3:21:21] <BustaGrimez> it's fine
[3:21:21] <Mendin> There was a classic Rock Paper Shotgun review of the original Pathologic
[3:21:22] <dukenux> It's proper fucked
[3:21:23] <Angry_Ev1L> it's like dark souls of adventure games
[3:21:24] <Gruntini> Mando made a wicked video on the original game
[3:21:25] <+timmc916> Sseth is a human shitpost and i love him
[3:21:27] <garagon31> I watched Marshall Dyer do the first Pathologic
[3:21:28] <%starotter70> It's built for cruelty
[3:21:29] <dukenux> So like Death Stranding?
[3:21:29] <+Zxtole> No game blogger mode
[3:21:35] <natebud> It is custom made to fuck with you.
[3:21:35] <Zepper202> Pat you didn't even get to the plague, you don't know how fucked it gets
[3:21:38] <%WhereIsWill> born to die!
[3:21:42] <T_Sasquatch> so its bad ? LUL
[3:21:42] <%honeyman18> The value of an EGG or NUT is astounding
[3:21:47] <$onlypuppet> Try Pathologic 1
[3:21:48] <Angry_Ev1L> it's too meta for metacritic
[3:21:49] <KoryMccool> Sseth = Lowkey best reviewer
[3:21:53] <%ennui_on_me> It's the God Hand of walking simulators
[3:21:59] <nikoloas_> yeah the journos didn't like it ause it was too hard
[3:22:03] <natebud> The value of a dirty bandage though @honeyman18
[3:22:04] <pan_nochal> it seems unfair but once you get into a good rhythm and understand what the game expects from you, it can even be enjoyable
[3:22:04] <gluemanofficial> Wait are the critics or the users the ones who love the game
[3:22:04] <JumbleJams> trade flowers to the this one specific girl for ultra medicine
[3:22:05] <+Junkfist> we release dlc, in it we cut out your eye. No, not character eye, player eye. Only cost 5 of your fingernails.
[3:22:12] <MattDemers> Dota has "Dota Plus" which is a *** for Dota
[3:22:12] <%Agami23> also, to anyone who sees this, dothack is back apatGib
[3:22:13] <dukenux> The Dark Souls of janky eastern european games
[3:22:18] <Mendin> Yeah if your brain was shattering over the first half of day 1, you're in for Big Bad Times for day 2+ when shit actually starts going south
[3:22:20] <MattDemers> (and that Dota plus is NOT the subscription)
[3:22:22] <%ThatOneGameTester> Dota was painful to learn
[3:22:23] <$Chimeraelite> Sseth's review of Godhand was GREAT and the madman comissioned artists off the sponsor LUL
[3:22:33] <critfumble_> i wish i new how to quit dota 2
[3:22:36] <%starotter70> Oh yeah
