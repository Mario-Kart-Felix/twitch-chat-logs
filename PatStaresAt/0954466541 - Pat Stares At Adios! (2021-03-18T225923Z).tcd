[0:18:56] <heart_ablaze> that's a lie

[0:18:59] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Lying
[0:18:59] <gslayer14> how can you tell which is the marriage boob then?
[0:19:00] <%bevyrage> paige you have talked about your bigger/better boob a LOT
[0:19:00] <%Ranryu692> this is why streams are always better when Pat and Paige are both present
[0:19:00] <zk_nails> Kappa
[0:19:02] <%StrawberryPantsu> Pat's boobs aren't

[0:21:03] <%sweetestbeefs> don't temp me, I have little to no monies left to buy video games :(
[0:21:03] <%Ranryu692> I bought it earlier, but didn't have time to play it before the stream started
[0:21:03] <%UvBenServed> Nope
[0:21:05] <JustYudha> Uh oh
[0:21:06] <%Daxalog> What if its the Doom dlc? Can your stream be a replacement for that?

[0:21:53] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Best is Mad Dog McCree, second best is House Party
[0:21:55] <rusty_shackleford104> bloodborne was good
[0:21:56] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I hate game fucks
[0:21:59] <DianaTheAscian> The sotc lp is fun
[0:22:01] <%RyTYoung> I stopped at wind waker
[0:22:01] <%StrawberryPantsu> I like Goof Troop...
[0:22:02] <%Daxalog> Goof troop and Sonic 06 were my faves.
[0:22:03] <$RealThiele> mike caruba
[0:22:09] <KaneCube> I didn't think Peach watched Let's Plays since she's engaged to one
[0:22:12] <+IxDomxI> bomb bowling?
[0:22:12] <Warbot40> Trauma Center
[0:22:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> I've watched most of SBFP stuff twice
[0:22:22] <%AkronymCLT> Shadow of the Colossus was fun
[0:22:23] <%linSP> is Eli alright
[0:22:23] <RyanGelatin> game CHUMPS more like
[0:22:23] <Psyramics> Arin doesn't like Skyward Sword and that's why that LP is good
[0:22:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> I've watched the Dark Souls LPs like three times each
[0:22:27] <%Movemeister> "good"
[0:22:29] <rusty_shackleford104> I kind of miss their old stuff
[0:22:30] <DianaTheAscian> OH MAN TRAUMA CENTER
[0:22:32] <%Evil_John_Cena> super mario sunshine is my favorite
[0:22:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> I lost all taste for Grumps, outside of Phoenix Wright, because Arin is insufferable in his Dunning-Kruger effect.
[0:22:37] <%wibbwobbler> I've watched way too much gg!
[0:22:37] <%sweetestbeefs> I really liked the jontron era and early dan era, I kinda fell off after their sonic and the black knight era
[0:22:39] <%bhp_99> as a big fan of Majora's Mask I hated their series on it
[0:22:43] <+Massimoman64> good with multiple asteriks
[0:22:45] <%RyTYoung> yup
[0:22:46] <LilacsandFreedom> Trauma Center was incredible
[0:22:47] <%Puhff> LUL
[0:22:54] <+PlatinumRevol> So used to watching the vods that I tried pausing the stream
[0:22:56] <%bhp_99> like i like GG but i couldnt watch it
[0:22:58] <KaneCube> DDLC is amazing
[0:22:58] <%Puhff> yeah arin ragequit majora's mask
[0:23:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> House Party is fucking hilarious
[0:23:04] <$Futurecity10> The ocarina playthrough is what made me drop GG, Arins a fucking idiot
[0:23:06] <%linSP> it’s entertaining in an “oh my god why arin why”
[0:23:08] <DianaTheAscian> sonic adventure was good
[0:23:12] <%YakumoYomi> UNAVOIDABLE CHIN MOVE!
[0:23:12] <OwlLightningMage> I enjoy GG in short bursts
[0:23:14] <dredgyboi> We dont talk about Jon
[0:23:16] <AvroEltz> monopoly is great
[0:23:17] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[0:23:18] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva what about Dream Course?
[0:23:18] <%sweetestbeefs> The wheel of fortune episode is SO GOOD
[0:23:19] <%JoshManVGH> Wheel of Fortune!
[0:23:20] <%Alazull> Pat you know that back in the day there was a panel where someone said how grateful they were for the TBFP for being able to see a lot of games played well
[0:23:22] <blackbookalpha> wait who's Jon? (wink)
[0:23:22] <%sweetestbeefs> LOSE A TURN
[0:23:22] <KaneCube> Sonic Boom was fun too
[0:23:23] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah I kinda like those too Paige,those trivia things.
[0:23:24] <Brandon__Brando> I've only seen the job tron era
[0:23:25] <+aslfrasle> MONOPOLY
[0:23:25] <+D00msDayDan> race car
[0:23:26] <%heartlesshealer> Remember Wheel of Fortune? LOSE A TURN
[0:23:26] <%Puhff> sonic '06 is great
[0:23:27] <+atwitchical> The wheel of fortune episodes are great
[0:23:29] <Brandon__Brando> jon
[0:23:29] <%xmetalicdemonx> WOW fake fan
[0:23:29] <%ssjklyco> I liked Watching Dan play Phillips CDI golf game
[0:23:29] <%RyTYoung> The Ben Swartz guest grumps episodes are great
[0:23:31] <Warbot40> Arin's shockingly bad. It actually gets hard to watch even if when the game is flawed.
[0:23:34] <+barkon345> where dan kept getting bankrupt
[0:23:39] <%AkronymCLT> the ones with SuperMega are good
[0:23:40] <Warbot40> bad at games
[0:23:41] <%corepool> I heard screaming at clams and I knew they were talking about Arin lol
[0:23:41] <%baronblank> I imagine a lot of people watch it for that
[0:23:41] <OwlLightningMage> THAT'S WHY PAT
[0:23:42] <%Emperor_Machinus> Bankruptcy
[0:23:42] <@SoFarFetched> That's why we're here Pat geefPlz
[0:23:44] <$RealThiele> yup
[0:23:45] <%Evil_John_Cena> watching it to watch suffering is amazing
[0:23:46] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt That's what its there for
[0:23:51] <heart_ablaze> you've seen THE
[0:23:51] <%patriotrenegade> And possibly yell a racial slur
[0:23:56] <%JoshManVGH> 10 Minute Power Hour on their other channel is also great
[0:23:56] <+PlatinumRevol> Watch to suffer
[0:23:57] <$RealThiele> bad at games. yeah
[0:23:58] <%sweetestbeefs> Paige doesn't keep screaming her lungs out though
[0:24:03] <KaneCube> GG + Supermega are some of the best
[0:24:03] <DomonTrigger> If I can't be the best I sure as hell can be the worst
[0:24:03] <%xmetalicdemonx> and zangief is dan
[0:24:06] <%brickwall35> Pat smells
[0:24:12] <Sunstalker> kinamaHappyW I watch Paige to hear her laugh at her own jokes and just break down into a cry/laughing/sobbing messs
[0:24:14] <Pookiedaexzile> No Paige is Peach Saliva
[0:24:14] <%krispen_wa> remember when arin wrote that intelligent video essay about how Mega Man X taught good game design, and then he proceeded to lose all his brain cells shortly after?
[0:24:19] <OwlLightningMage> Unavoidable chin move is a classic
[0:24:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> Arin is like if DSP wasn't an asshole. He's still mad at reality for defying him.
[0:24:22] <%linSP> Paige channels arin a lot
[0:24:23] <%AzureGale> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL

[0:25:06] <%Mothman007> Mothman007 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Hey Pat, doing a Dragon Age playthrough. DA: Origins kinda blows, Awakening rocks, 2 kinda blows, Inquisition is exhausting
[0:25:11] <%linSP> i feel so bad for dan sometimes
[0:25:14] <DomonTrigger> I like the one with Matt and Woolie
[0:25:21] <%Puhff> but how good are you art spinning?
[0:25:27] <%Evil_John_Cena> @PeachSaliva you have a dog a cat a skeleton a lobster and a man how long before you convert your stream into a zoo?
[0:25:32] <+D00msDayDan> deposits are finite but world generation is infinite
[0:25:35] <OwlLightningMage> DA Origins is the shit
[0:25:39] <%YakumoYomi> The Dinotopia one, or the Spiderman one?
[0:25:39] <%heartlesshealer> Pollution is FAR more important if you keep hostiles On
[0:25:44] <%MidnightBurst12> That sounds nuts
[0:25:46] <AncelDeLambert> Factorio has HUGE piles of resources, it takes forever to deplete
[0:25:52] <+SkitsofRandom> In factorio unless you have someone guiding you it's to your advantage to do a few hours without aliens
[0:25:52] <+PlatinumRevol> You know what else has infinite maps? That's right, Minecraft
[0:25:53] <Visorak6> good bye emlo
[0:25:59] <%AncelDeLambert> that said, start a map with increased resource size
[0:26:01] <%Bailey__gaming> EMLO
[0:26:04] <%TrafficCohen> Dragon Age Origins continues to be the only good game in it's series
[0:26:06] <%krispen_wa> Evil John Cena, my greatest nemesis
[0:26:09] <KaneCube> Where will Zangief go when both of y'all stream tho? I need to know which one to watch ;)
[0:26:10] <saiyanblitz> Their a game called Adios
[0:26:10] <%YakumoYomi> Disc Room
[0:26:12] <+D00msDayDan> yeah you can have drones build your shit for you, then send a spidertron with roboports out to build them
[0:26:20] <%walternatorz> Pat is going to build a self replicating toilet factory so he can obtain immortality
[0:26:23] <OwlLightningMage> Inquisition is okayish
[0:26:25] <%Evil_John_Cena> @krispen_wa i dont believe you
[0:26:26] <%Arweynn> DISC ROOM
[0:26:32] <%linSP> more like dicks room
[0:26:35] <%AzureGale> ohno
[0:26:46] <+loukemia83> How does anyone get a 3070 these days?
[0:26:47] <%TrafficCohen> @OwlLightningMage I dislike MMO style questing in my single player RPGs
[0:26:48] <ItIsSky> I definitely got to a point in Factorio when I started to just cover everything in concrete.
[0:26:48] <%heartlesshealer> the cursed words, "what are you eating"
[0:26:51] <OwlLightningMage> The main issue with inquisition is all the open world nonsense
[0:26:52] <%brickwall35> what is THAT? what THE FUCK IS THAT?!
[0:26:53] <%YakumoYomi> I still want one of those new GPUs. Good thing Rise is right around the corner to distract me.
[0:26:59] <%krispen_wa> DE is so FUCKIN good
[0:27:01] <%linSP> @loukemia83 get a bundle

[0:29:12] <OwlLightningMage> Guilty Gear Strive is going to be a PS3 exclusive Kappa
[0:29:14] <RyanGelatin> my friend is attempting to play every single final fantyasy and almost tapped out at saga 2
[0:29:16] <bahble> it's kinda like zelda
[0:29:17] <%krispen_wa> 8 is good for Triple Triad
[0:29:19] <%TrafficCohen> CRISIS CORE IS THE BEST
[0:29:19] <%StrawberryPantsu> Same with 13
[0:29:21] <KaneCube> get dog lapel mic
[0:29:29] <OwlLightningMage> I don't hate 2
[0:29:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> SHIT ON IT
[0:29:36] <ItIsSky> 8 is interesting
[0:29:37] <%TrafficCohen> CRISIS CORE
[0:29:39] <sendart> pat be quiet I want to hear gief snouts better
[0:29:40] <%heartlesshealer> 8 outside of FF context was good
[0:29:43] <%Alazull> FF8 beats 13 hands down
[0:29:44] <RyanGelatin> my best friend is attempting to play every single final fantyasy and almost tapped out at saga 2
[0:29:45] <TopTierHarley> lol Gief with a lapel mic LUL
[0:29:45] <%JoshManVGH> Eeeeeeeeeeeeh 8.... just has some wacky poorly explained shit.
[0:29:48] <%Bailey__gaming> 8 has TRIPLE TRIAD
[0:29:49] <PinoProxie> PLAY 11
[0:29:50] <%TrafficCohen> Leave 13 alone
[0:29:51] <@SoFarFetched> HEY Don't talk about Cog like that
[0:29:52] <%krispen_wa> Zack is great, Crisis Core is just okay
[0:29:52] <%TalisKanju> X2 is not fun.
[0:29:52] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> 6 is the best cause it's the one i played first
[0:29:57] <%MisterTylerrr> ff11 is a second job
[0:29:58] <%walternatorz> XI IS GREAT
[0:29:59] <Estuko> I like 12 :(
[0:30:00] <+loukemia83> 8 is the worst of the post 6 games until 13
[0:30:00] <%AncelDeLambert> 10-2 is a hoot if you let it be
[0:30:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> 13 sucks
[0:30:01] <%justacrow84> doodStare
[0:30:03] <%sweetestbeefs> 13-1 is okay
[0:30:03] <DianaTheAscian> ITS SO BAD
[0:30:04] <OwlLightningMage> 13 might actually be the worst ever
[0:30:05] <ExpressNode> 2 is always the black sheep. No one really defends that one other than 13.
[0:30:05] <DexteraXIII> X2 somehow plays the best of all of them
[0:30:05] <%ConLin_Arts_> 13-2 is fine
[0:30:06] <%Frost_Quill> 11 is fun if you like old ass mmos and join one of the dedicated servers for it.
[0:30:07] <%Ranryu692> Destiny is Destiny
[0:30:07] <%BinaryFireball> 15 was ok
[0:30:08] <%ConLin_Arts_> I liked it
[0:30:08] <%StrawberryPantsu> 13 trilogy is fine
[0:30:12] <%Alazull> FF11 was good for it's time
[0:30:13] <%krispen_wa> 13 is the author's fetish
[0:30:14] <KaneCube> My gf loves X-2, but has never played FFX
[0:30:14] <F_manS> 15 is eh
[0:30:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> 15 is a meme

[0:30:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> TRUE
[0:30:26] <$RealThiele> the boys are back in townnnn
[0:30:27] <%saadi90> saadi90 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! Hey Pat! Don’t know if you remember the family hating the fact that I’m gay. Well, now I’m banned from Pakistan. Yes, the country. Uncle said that if I set foot in the country, he will have me beaten to death. He is a military person in Pakistan.
[0:30:28] <%MisterRockett> 15 I finished and yeah
[0:30:29] <%JoshManVGH> 13 is a series that resolves itself by the protagonists did NOTHING.
[0:30:29] <%sweetestbeefs> 15 was a decent story, I didnt like the combat though
[0:30:30] <%weissguard> How's that FFIV playthrough going Peach?
[0:30:30] <DexteraXIII> Half a chocolate bar?
[0:30:31] <DomonTrigger> X-2 rules
[0:30:31] <+loukemia83> Dress Spheres ARE THE BEST
[0:30:32] <%Frost_Quill> X-2 is fun.

[0:30:35] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Tactics is still best
[0:30:39] <OwlLightningMage> 15 is agressivly unfinished and jank
[0:30:41] <+chaumiester> That is weirdly specific. Why Ukraine?
[0:30:41] <+Dumb_Parrot> Also pretty much unfinished.
[0:30:41] <%vehementvadr> Cheer500 you know, no offense to paige, but sometimes when she describes the amount of times she's almost died, I begin to wonder how long a far more introverted paige would've lived not talking to the people that stopped her from walking into the street, also congratulations!
[0:30:42] <%TrafficCohen> I stopped midway through FF2
[0:30:43] <+Sp3ctre48> I don't know what that means but I agree
[0:30:45] <@SoFarFetched> Chat's g onna riot cause you talked smack about Cog
[0:30:46] <%TrafficCohen> 2 is weird
[0:30:46] <+shad8snake> 15 got that jank
[0:30:49] <%AncelDeLambert> 13 was the true death of the series, it limped on ever since
[0:30:51] <HarmlessCrow> Oh yeah Noctis is peak ukranian protagonist
[0:30:52] <DexteraXIII> At Pulse?
[0:30:55] <%Ranryu692> 15 sort of becomes Stardust Crusaders near the end
[0:30:56] <ExpressNode> 13-2 and lightening returns are alright
[0:30:57] <%bhp_99> i got stuck in 13 right before it "got good"
[0:30:57] <OwlLightningMage> Same with 13
[0:30:58] <cherrycottontail> I got to alexander and gave up
[0:31:00] <F_manS> I put like 4 hours in and stop, was my first FF game not a good first impression.
[0:31:02] <%saadi90> 13 was boring
[0:31:02] <%JoshManVGH> A character tells you that you NEED to kill the final boss so the world can be destroied.
[0:31:03] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt today's the 7th anniversary of 10-2 actually
[0:31:04] <%TrafficCohen> 16 looks interesting
[0:31:04] <%AncelDeLambert> KISS HIM FACE!
[0:31:06] <+b1unkey> pretty sure 13 was the last game I ever rented lol
[0:31:10] <%Frost_Quill> The battle system and the dress spheres in X-2 was fun.
[0:31:10] <%Puhff> FF15 is like eating a nice steak with a side of burnt fries and off-brand Koolaid
[0:31:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> Money
[0:31:12] <+CaptainPearz> Cant wait for ff16
[0:31:13] <+JustToWatch> Paige you don't need to sing about Pat on stream
[0:31:16] <@SoFarFetched> JEnna must have been high during that
[0:31:16] <+docseuss> *waves* hi pat, it's me doc
[0:31:29] <%patriotrenegade> shes that lady right
[0:31:31] <+docseuss> if u encounter bugs please laugh
[0:31:31] <PinoProxie> is he too big for smash?
[0:31:33] <TopTierHarley> just lift more weight
[0:31:38] <%walternatorz> He's not a fat man, he's a dense man.
[0:31:41] <$BinaryFireball> zangief hate spoiler
[0:31:42] <%BinaryFireball> hahahaha
[0:31:43] <TopTierHarley> then you can get big and lift him

[0:31:59] <%vivaldiva> is he eating the mic?
[0:31:59] <Psyramics> KOTOR 2 is out of date, Aegis Rim is never out of date
[0:31:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> PAST 10 YEARS IS NOT A SPOILER
[0:32:00] <Visorak6> 13 sentinels is a unique case but most games I give a 10 year window
[0:32:02] <+shad8snake> asmr
[0:32:03] <sendart> psaDogchamp
[0:32:03] <blackbookalpha> FF15 spending 8 years uncooked in the Nomura oven, Tabata had to cook it in 2 years
[0:32:05] <%linSP> 👉 psaGiefrail
[0:32:06] <+PlatinumRevol> Woolie also only half listens
[0:32:06] <sweetestbeefs> if the game is past 10 years, it's free
[0:32:06] <%Alazull> Seventeen years old and well fucking known
[0:32:14] <%heartlesshealer> depends on how widespread the audience is if it's 8+ years old
[0:32:15] <ExpressNode> I guess he was just concerned about the audience
[0:32:17] <$RealThiele> 17 year old spoilers LUL fuck off
[0:32:18] <TopTierHarley> I'm not giving any game a 10 year window
[0:32:19] <Broken_Sonex> @sonofthedeepsouth Exactly.
[0:32:22] <%weissguard> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[0:32:22] <Psyramics> 30 years from now, you need spoiler warnings for 13 Sentinels
[0:32:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> 10 YEARS+ IS NOT SPOILER
[0:32:23] <%Mr_Pylon> The ship had not only sailed, but had been decommisioned at that point
[0:32:24] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You have content?
[0:32:25] <%wibbwobbler> 1 year? idk
[0:32:27] <+Sovspot> your discussion of that game made me never want to play it
[0:32:29] <+JustToWatch> Zangief sounds like he has sleep apnea when he's awake
[0:32:30] <%heartlesshealer> if it's 15+ years then who gives a shit
[0:32:35] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> 3
[0:32:36] <KaneCube> if it's new or old and back in the general public eye, I feel like a spoiler warning is necessary. otherwise, whatever lol
[0:32:37] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt nier?
[0:32:42] <%MisterRockett> Spoiler timers reset when someone you know personally is going through the content but otherwise yeah like, give it two years.
[0:32:43] <+loukemia83> Yeah, Spoiling Neir: Automata is a crime
[0:32:45] <+chaumiester> Ah yes. The Culprit!!
[0:32:46] <SomersaultJustice> 13 sentinels
[0:32:47] <sweetestbeefs> oh shit, yeah, you got a point
[0:32:47] <%patriotrenegade> Nier Automata? @PatStaresAt
[0:32:50] <%heartlesshealer> no one ever spoils frog fractions
[0:32:50] <%kewlmyc> Atlus does
[0:32:52] <TopTierHarley> true
[0:32:54] <%krispen_wa> Except Arkham spoilers apparently?
[0:32:56] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Outer wilds
[0:32:57] <AvroEltz> Outer wilds?
[0:32:59] <HarmlessCrow> El Culprito
[0:33:01] <%ssjklyco> 13 sentinals
[0:33:05] <ExpressNode> @PatStaresAt How do you feel about remakes from very old games?
[0:33:05] <%Mr_Pylon> Outer Wilds, 13 Sentinels are BIG no spoils
[0:33:09] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt I have an hour and a half left of 13 Sentinels, but I'm here instead
[0:33:11] <+PlatinumRevol> Automata ending E is special. You can't spoil it
[0:33:12] <%Garthunox> FF7R?
[0:33:14] <%Alazull> You could
[0:33:15] <OwlLightningMage> I will literally never spoil Neir Automata or the end of Trails of Cold Steel
[0:33:16] <KaneCube> Bro, I just finished 13 Sentinels, and I want to talk to someone about it so bad, but no one around me has played it so I CANT
[0:33:19] <%Frodiddly> literally what could possibly be spoiled about Arkham
[0:33:20] <%heartlesshealer> god I'm so mad at that nintendo direct for Outer Wilds
[0:33:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so basically anything that's main focus is the story
[0:33:23] <$Dakuu75> you could TRY spoiling 13 sentinels but, NO ONE would get it
[0:33:29] <ShichiNoBushi> I'm playing P5R right now and just got caught up with the interrogation scene.
[0:33:29] <%StrawberryPantsu> Literally Impossible to spoil 13S
[0:33:29] <%shruke> Yes thanks for not spoiling Culprit, I only played P4G this year
[0:33:31] <DianaTheAscian> I got spoiled on who it is so idk if p4 is even worth playing now @PatStaresAt
[0:33:32] <%walternatorz> dogbutt
[0:33:33] <%Valdorick> Areith fucking dies.
[0:33:35] <Broken_Sonex> It's like JoJo could could you spoil  13 Sentinels?
[0:33:35] <$RealThiele> yakisoba pan <3
[0:33:37] <TopTierHarley> right @Frodiddly it's a fucking Batman game
[0:33:42] <%krispen_wa> SNAPE KILLS AERITH
[0:33:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> AREITH DIES
[0:33:50] <Oasis_spring> @KaneCube i played it and STILL  have questions LUL
[0:33:51] <%RyTYoung> I was listening to GigaBoot's first podcast on YouTube and they were talking about 13 Sentinels...in January 2019 WutFace
[0:33:57] <+Prism_Zet> Boop gief's nose for me please
[0:33:58] <%talkwiththedead802> halfway through first newgame+ of nier: automata. I stopped. Are you guys saying theres like...more to the plot? have i not finished that game?
[0:34:03] <%Alazull> You could spoil 13 Sentinels, but it'd be such a dick move and it'd still take them hours of game before they knew you weren't lying
[0:34:10] <%Puhff> dumbledore kills aerif
[0:34:10] <cherrycottontail> The problem with FF7R is that those spoilers might not actually happen
[0:34:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @talkwiththedead802 yes
[0:34:13] <SomersaultJustice> I can't believe Cloud Tifa and Aerith were from the same orphanege
[0:34:14] <%oddslogic> I would never spoil anything but I love getting spoiled
[0:34:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> VADER IS LUKE FATHER PogChamp
[0:34:15] <%Frodiddly> @TopTierHarley spoilers: *one* of the bosses is good; speaking as someone who bought a PS4 specifically to play Arkham Knight
[0:34:17] <KaneCube> @oasis_spring the encyclopedia tab is your best friend my dude
[0:34:22] <%linSP> calling it air eth comes back to life in remake 2
[0:34:24] <%Lion_kun> what about persona?
[0:34:27] <younger54> "Try to be polite" would solve 90% of the worlds problems
[0:34:28] <%AzureGale> LUL
[0:34:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah Woolie is next level
[0:34:30] <+CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt I got SpiderMan spoiled today with a recommended Youtube video. Feels bad man
[0:34:33] <%talkwiththedead802> that just wrinkled my brain
[0:34:34] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[0:34:35] <sweetestbeefs> sometimes you really cant get away from that shit though, I remember I got aerith's death spoiled for me when I was like 12, and having never played a final fantasy game
[0:34:36] <+loukemia83> @talkwiththedead802 if you haven't gotten ending E you haven't finished the game
[0:34:36] <%heartlesshealer> @talkwiththedead802 I hope you're not serious saying this about a Yoko Taro game. If you are, please continue playing
[0:34:39] <+pectusumbra> @talkwiththedead802 Actually probably worth ditching this stream to go do that now
[0:34:39] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> And he doesn't remember it anyway?

[0:35:01] <rusty_shackleford104> attack on titan?

[0:36:08] <@StridentSong> @PatStaresAt The best thing you've ever said on spoilers is people screaming at you about God of War spoilers based on Norse Mythology, and I distinctly remember your phrase "It's like yelling at me to stop spoiling the bible!"
[0:36:09] <ShichiNoBushi> You fight Mr. Freeze in a Batman game!? *gasp*
[0:36:09] <%Mr_Pylon> Wait Batman FIGHTs someone with his WHOLE ARSENAL?!?!?
[0:36:09] <+shad8snake> Mr. Freeze boss fight the best one in the series
[0:36:12] <%JoshManVGH> So is talking about a move in a fighting game a spoiler?
[0:36:12] <%Lion_kun> Took him two hours.
[0:36:13] <heart_ablaze> woolie complained on stream about you talking about freeze
[0:36:14] <%ssjklyco> Chat would have spoiled him anyway, better you than chat.
[0:36:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> @marvel877 I'm still a little salty about that.
[0:36:16] <%heartlesshealer> @talkwiththedead802 Have fun and good luck with the baking!
[0:36:18] <%Niney_Who> Deny Gameplay, REFUSE SPOILERS
[0:36:18] <%SaiyanShoto> He said he only half listened anyway so he doesn’t remember you saying that
[0:36:22] <TopTierHarley> right Josh
[0:36:23] <Jolly_Adventurer> City was 2011 but yeah
[0:36:24] <sweetestbeefs> "DON'T TELL ME THAT YOU CAN PULL YOUR DEVIL TRIGGER BRO!!"
[0:36:27] <%talkwiththedead802> @OwlLightningMage good! that makes a lot more sense.
[0:36:27] <$dalmek> @heart_ablaze is your stream randomly moving back/forwards/stuttering?
[0:36:28] <TopTierHarley> exactly, fuck off
[0:36:30] <dukenux> BUT WHAT IF
[0:36:32] <%Puhff> Woolie will insist you not spoil a game that he's going to play for a few hours and then forget even exists
[0:36:33] <%Garthunox> At a certain point the onus is on the person getting spoiled, play the game or get spoiled, especially a 10-15 year old game
[0:36:34] <+docseuss> Oh so I shouldn't spoil Adios here in chat then
[0:36:35] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[0:36:37] <tattleworm> he'd literally just started playing the series
[0:36:37] <TopTierHarley> If you aren't gonna play it, why do you care
[0:36:37] <Visorak6> Jokes on you woolie did eventually play that game
[0:36:38] <Oasis_spring> @KaneCube oohhhh i never thought of that i didn't see the video thanks doodSmug
[0:36:38] <%TrafficCohen> If I don't care about something, spoil away
[0:36:39] <%wibbwobbler> he took his time lmao
[0:36:40] <marvel877> EVERYONE knew about that fight, its the best fight. Now mentioning that Clayface was in City, that's a bit of a spoiler.
[0:36:41] <%bevyrage> you get to either not care or not get spoiled on it
[0:36:43] <KaneCube> but what IF I CARE LATER
[0:36:44] <CatsDrunkonCopper> you fight an iconic batman villan isn't a spoiler
[0:36:44] <Psyramics> everything I have learned about Harry Potter has been against my will
[0:36:48] <%Cheeky_Cheekers> Cheeky_Cheekers subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[0:36:51] <F_manS> Should just lie about spoilers in games he plans on playing.
[0:36:53] <Broken_Sonex> Woolie complained on stream about you talking about freeze on stream.

[0:37:02] <ExpressNode> I don't really care about spoilers. I play mostly JRPGs and I sometimes watch some of the walkthrough before its localized
[0:37:02] <+banjostevens> Woolie and the Nier stuff in FFXIV!!! He will never ever play a MMO.
[0:37:03] <%kewlmyc> IF he plays it at all
[0:37:03] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> 25 years
[0:37:04] <+thelonechris> "I don't really care, but if you spoil this for me I will break your legs and burn down your house."
[0:37:06] <%honeyman18> 20
[0:37:06] <%Valdorick> And how many times you've talked about Yakuza 3 to him before this?
[0:37:06] <KaneCube> Usually if I don't care about it and someone spoils it, I wouldn't remember it later down the line
[0:37:07] <sweetestbeefs> At the rate he's going, at least 2
[0:37:07] <%MisterTylerrr> He hasn't even beaten SEkiro

[0:37:19] <%Deft_Thought> psaDogchamp

[0:37:34] <%king_wragles> If the 13 Sentinels LP showed us anything, you can tell Woolie about a scene in the game 2 minutes before it happens and there WILL be a solid chance he'll just forget

[0:37:48] <+LastHazzerd> So? like it's not up to you what someone thinks is a spoiler, you can whine about it but you're still the one in the wrong if you ignore it
[0:37:49] <KainZero0> he do cute
[0:37:50] <TopTierHarley> @dukenux that's a personal problem then, if a game is 2-3 years old I feel you, otherwise there's no excuse
[0:37:51] <Ice_Ventura549> Gief sounds like he's perpetually waterboarded
[0:37:51] <+D00msDayDan> i have a friend who talks about ace combat 7 soundtrack spoilers and im like daredevil doesn't even hit out of context

[0:59:27] <+thegreenbenis> Back in my day the 8track tapes were made of knives.
[0:59:29] <%Jekado> @Taisuru 8 track is basically one long tape in a loop.  There is no way to rewind so if you want to play the first song again you have to play the whole thing.
[0:59:29] <42nfl19> Just HOSE IT ALL DOWN

[1:04:52] <$RenegadeHatter> I'm glad even though you're not playing Satisfactory you're still helping that company by playing Goat Simulator
[1:04:54] <%Garthunox> this art style reminds of the the original XIII on PS2
[1:04:56] <adzy2k6> I wonder what was on the pictures in the dark room, considering what he's been doing
[1:04:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> Just leave the milk there
[1:05:00] <ExpressNode> I guess that's what makes the pigs taste so good
[1:05:03] <%Valdorick> Locked
[1:05:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ok, so you can feed the people meat to the pigs. But what about the BONES?

[1:05:19] <younger54> Does he really think they are just going to let him walk away?
[1:05:19] <+thelonechris> Pig shit is probably 10 times heavier with bone fragments mixed in
[1:05:20] <theshillman> rip
[1:05:23] <$SGrim> @GarbageQueenEllie pigs will eat bone
[1:05:23] <CappuccinoGuil> @GarbageQueenEllie they eat right through it

[1:05:53] <theshillman> eli is the norm
[1:05:54] <%Taisuru> Eli will outlive us all
[1:05:55] <$Futurecity10> Yeah but plague is very different
[1:05:57] <$RenegadeHatter> The pain deepens the voice and the furry addiction
[1:06:00] <ape_hawk> i mean, pigs are just smaller hippos
[1:06:00] <aura_00> Eli still has hate inside him
[1:06:02] <Laioken13> i'm dead inside from just living

[1:12:40] <%docseuss> I have no idea if you can throw him a pop after the scene ends
[1:12:42] <+OmegaWeltall> i asked for orange, it gave me lemon lime
[1:12:43] <OwlLightningMage> You can't just walk away from the mob. He's obviously gonna kill him o
[1:12:43] <baddod> Dad?
[1:12:43] <CappuccinoGuil> Huh, I got a pop when I played?
[1:12:44] <sweetestbeefs> I'm gonna call it, the hitman MIGHT be the son, Bill i think his name was

[1:17:47] <RyanGelatin> the slowdown when you walk out of the area feels reeeallll janky
[1:17:48] <Ice_Ventura549> Horseshoes are fun
[1:17:48] <+MisterAvry> Pool halls still totally exist
[1:17:49] <42nfl19> 1992!!
[1:17:49] <+thelonechris> The futuristic year of 1992
[1:17:53] <aiutare47> It’s giving me fucky vibes
[1:17:54] <Pookiedaexzile> 1992?
[1:17:54] <dukenux> F U T U R E
[1:17:54] <%ssjklyco> They still exist
[1:17:58] <%Rumbutt> This dude's out of touch, I fucking hit pool halls in the 2010's what a fool
[1:17:58] <+MisterAvry> people still like pool
[1:17:59] <%Jekado> anything in the 90's is a horror game
[1:18:01] <%Mendin> 92? And he was doing shit back in the 50s? Grandpa Farm Man
[1:18:02] <%docseuss> btw it is alternate history; the gulf war is still ongoing because saddam hussein is currently resurrecting ishtar as a bioweapon
[1:18:03] <%ssjklyco> This gman is dumb
[1:18:10] <Foxsploder> There is literally a pool hall in walking distance of my house
[1:18:13] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, did you notice the pigs have like, nipples on their chins?
[1:18:14] <+CapnClassix> Fishing fucking SLAPS
[1:18:16] <%solracc25> why is his head so tiny?
[1:18:19] <%ringabal> OH HERE WE GO
[1:18:20] <ape_hawk> huh
[1:18:20] <butthurtdave> I hate how accurate this is to a small country town

[1:18:21] <%Bailey__gaming> SUPER MARIO KART just came out!
[1:18:22] <RyanGelatin> ohhhh yeahhhhhh
[1:18:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> @docseuss HOLY SHIT
[1:18:25] <RyanGelatin> i LOVE this
[1:18:25] <%Taisuru> He can't
[1:18:27] <%JoshManVGH> @bevyrage Horse The Lunchbox, Horse The Breakfast Cereal,  Horse The FLAMETHROWER!
[1:18:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> Not sure I could handle that lifestyle. I'd get antsy.
[1:18:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> FISHING IS POG
[1:18:30] <%Taisuru> I like it
[1:18:31] <$SGrim> Dialog locked
[1:18:33] <+MisterAvry> Is this a Hallmark movie? Is this guy gonna meet a hometown girl who loves Christmas?
[1:18:35] <+shad8snake> uh oh
[1:18:35] <%EternalJedi> limesS
[1:18:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> FISHING IS GREAT
[1:18:35] <missingangle> Oh?
[1:18:37] <TheHeroAppears> that's cool
[1:18:37] <%Deano8817> ever?
[1:18:39] <ape_hawk> thats a choice
[1:18:40] <dukenux> maybe pool halls went temporarilly out of fashion in the 90s
[1:18:41] <$dalmek> @docseuss I need to know where I can find out more
[1:18:42] <%Mendin> @CappuccinoGuil They talked about the pigs having wattles
[1:18:42] <%Valdorick> They're thoughts that he can't ever say.
[1:18:42] <%Taisuru> Sometimes saying things is hard
[1:18:43] <RyanGelatin> GREYED OPTIONS ARE THE FUTUR E OF CHOICE BASED GAME NARRATIVE
[1:18:48] <missingangle> That's interesting
[1:18:49] <%docseuss> Wait you can't do the courage options???
[1:18:52] <%xmetalicdemonx> oh internal thoughts or something like that
[1:18:52] <OwlLightningMage> WHAT
[1:18:53] <CappuccinoGuil> @Mendin sick
[1:18:55] <$dalmek> it's also weird and tilted too
[1:18:58] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> They aren't shit he'll ever say, just things he thinks in his head
[1:18:58] <%docseuss> no I just wanted to give you a chance to think something but not say it
[1:19:00] <sweetestbeefs> it gives insight into the character though!!
[1:19:03] <%Daxalog> Thats fine. Its like your lying to yourself but you dont believe it
[1:19:04] <RyanGelatin> how to level up courage doc
[1:19:07] <+PenmanLupine> @docseuss not until New Game Plus when you keep the stats
[1:19:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Take away options for story telling
[1:19:11] <%docseuss> Like in paratopic how i had "<lie> I do not like giant balls of twine"
[1:19:12] <%Valdorick> That's also what REAL FUCKING PEOPLE DO. Think "I should say" but know they shouldn't, so don't, ever.
[1:19:15] <RyanGelatin> do we drink 20 root bears in 5 mins
[1:19:17] <%Deano8817> I get the intention, but it's going to veery depend on how this game executes it
[1:19:19] <ToneBacas> so they're unspoken thoughts but they're there either way
[1:19:20] <%Mendin> It's something about t hem being a rarer uncommon breed he likes to raise
[1:19:20] <iosephe> throw up
[1:19:20] <aura_00> NGL farm lfe sounds like my personal hell
[1:19:23] <missingangle> he wants to say it, but never ever can bring himself to
[1:19:24] <%JoshManVGH> bad toss
[1:19:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> lol nice throw babby
[1:19:24] <%docseuss> I like playing with dialogue as a tool
[1:19:26] <%heartlesshealer> is this physics throwing?
[1:19:27] <jorniev> @docseuss thought as much
[1:19:27] <%xmetalicdemonx> But if hes gonna die why not say what comes to his mind
[1:19:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> That's a really good way to give insight into your characters thoughts
[1:19:38] <%ssjklyco> "Please Not Rambo, we want you back"
[1:19:39] <%Valdorick> Cheater
[1:19:42] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, stop cheating
[1:19:43] <%hax_metatron> This is the actual game

[1:19:50] <+MisterAvry> get a ringer!
[1:19:52] <%docseuss> iirc if u hold u can charge
[1:19:52] <RyanGelatin> the use of dialogue choices to expand game narrative is the best thing ever and this game and disco elysium do it so well @docseuss
[1:19:53] <+loukemia83> can you go around this side and cheat?
[1:19:55] <+ghostfaceninja_> pretty sure you dont throw horseshoes like that LUL
[1:19:56] <+iceballstwitch> stuff like this gets me because I will one day too be a sad old man

[1:20:09] <%king_wragles> Wait, is it not counting dingers?
[1:20:10] <%docseuss> @RyanGelatin I am in the special thanks of Disco Elysium lol
[1:20:13] <missingangle> It's a nice play on having dialogue options that never matter to the story anyway, certainly. I'm into it
[1:20:15] <%king_wragles> Who doesn't count dingers?
[1:20:19] <+JustToWatch> horseshoes throw much weirder than you expect them to
[1:20:23] <%Azurism_> Is the guy in the suit being voiced by Albert Wesker
[1:20:25] <+MisterAvry> why does it make you throw them stupid?
[1:20:26] <%docseuss> (I played it early and gave them some spelling/grammar feedback lol)

[1:24:46] <FennecZephyr> I can imagine that being a real event
[1:24:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @nomolomo its a narrative game man
[1:24:49] <+pectusumbra> Things like this have happened multiple times over history
[1:24:49] <%kewlmyc> Thought this game suddenly changed genre

[1:25:14] <%docseuss> Of course it's real I used to work on chestnuts for a guy who wanted to resurrect the trees, so I put it in the game
[1:25:18] <$RenegadeHatter> I love when games tell me history of a world I'll never see
[1:25:22] <DianaTheAscian> that tree story is true?
[1:25:25] <$Futurecity10> Chestnut furniture is like 6-10k
[1:25:29] <dukenux> we have chestnuts being sick to a different fungal infection now
[1:25:30] <+Romuken> yep

[1:28:55] <%Valdorick> "I really like you buddy, which is why Sol will need to kill you, buddy."
[1:29:01] <dukenux> El Camino is like if a Mustang fucked a pick up
[1:29:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's a fresh El Camino, rolled, Kilo G
[1:29:07] <+Figleafplays> ngl i read that as poop the hood

[1:31:46] <$HairballCT> monkaS
[1:31:49] <+livi242> @trollking96 nature of the work I suppose lol
[1:31:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> @TrollKing96 Well, you can't just let the cops know about all the CRIME
[1:31:59] <%docseuss> "roy would've been his age" = Roy is Hitman's son

[1:32:23] <DianaTheAscian> LUL
[1:32:24] <aiutare47> @cappuccinoguil Holy shit, I hate paratopic, it’s fantastic. That totally explains the atmosphere.
[1:32:25] <%baka_sugoi> WAT?
[1:32:26] <Visorak6> He's desperate to keep coming up with shit to talk about because they'll have to get to business eventually, I figure
[1:32:28] <+shad8snake> thats sicc
[1:32:29] <OwlLightningMage> Farmers are all weirdos
[1:32:29] <%SuckerPunchSyd> WHAT
[1:32:31] <ToneBacas> mundy!
[1:32:33] <%docseuss> btw "chuck" is a reference to a real guy named walter soplata
[1:32:38] <dukenux> magnesium?
[1:32:39] <%bevyrage> farmers always have a hobby to work on, and some farmers who work with fields will be aeronautically inclined for dusting or fire control
[1:32:42] <%EternalJedi> oh, that's a big fuckin plane
[1:32:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> A b36?
[1:32:45] <%ashenfrenzy> I really like this whole conversation about the planes
[1:32:47] <%ChestMimik> And thats the end of that I guess
[1:32:48] <Noogiez> farmers be farmin
[1:32:50] <OwlLightningMage> Plague doesn't even need his fences. He just likes building them
[1:32:52] <+MisterAvry> riiight there. *does not move*

[1:33:01] <@SoFarFetched> @docseuss that's a neat reference
[1:33:02] <jorniev> WHAT
[1:33:02] <RyanGelatin> farmer dreams
[1:33:02] <+D00msDayDan> oh man i looked up the B36 and that's a big boy
[1:33:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> CHUCK LIKES PLANES
[1:33:11] <Vadrigar1994> What if this game gets really supernatural in the last few minutes
[1:33:12] <%Invlux> I'm extremely concerned about this scene
[1:33:14] <%EternalJedi> dukenux one of the better materials they had back then for structure vs weight
[1:33:19] <%Bailey__gaming> Planes are cool
[1:33:21] <%docseuss> walter soplata didactually save a b-36
[1:33:22] <+ghostfaceninja_> what is this field of dreams shit LUL
[1:33:27] <%ringabal> There's a lot more planes in the ocean than there should be
[1:33:29] <DianaTheAscian> Thats super Fair
[1:33:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> Good Chuck
[1:33:41] <balthazar758> save the planes, chuck
[1:33:45] <+MisterAvry> Like Field of Dreams but for bombers
[1:33:47] <%Mendin> ghost law of thermodynamics
[1:33:47] <GarbageQueenEllie> Farm man should just *kill* him. Get him before he gets you!
[1:33:47] <OwlLightningMage> The Sun told me to cancel my game

[1:34:37] <xcompleasedad> Whelp, I'm wrong
[1:34:38] <sendart> end lol
[1:34:39] <%solracc25> Needs to be a huge museum to hold all them planes
[1:34:41] <HeroToxiko> 93 is when we left
[1:34:43] <ShichiNoBushi> Did it end?
[1:34:48] <%MidnightBurst12> classified
[1:34:48] <@SoFarFetched> well you see we're in a "different" war now
[1:34:48] <iosephe> spooky alternate universe
[1:34:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> 93
[1:34:50] <%CopperTucker> Pat that implies it ended
[1:34:51] <%docseuss> in this game desert storm doesn't end until like 1994 so I can get white zombie in the soundtrack

[1:41:03] <skyentombment> @Ne0nF0xx Says you! Cuz I know that I'll get through this
[1:41:07] <%mikessdd> @docseuss Is doggo
[1:41:17] <ShichiNoBushi> How does this rank among fishing mini-games?
[1:41:19] <+MisterAvry> why keep it?
[1:41:22] <+CapnClassix> Catfish nuggets
[1:41:27] <T_Sasquatch> Dog shoring while fishing.  Such is life
[1:41:31] <+balkonas1> @decimated_body a fat baby dogo sleeping
[1:41:32] <%bevyrage> catfish is pretty good to eat
[1:41:35] <CappuccinoGuil> @docseuss is the cooler close enoug that you can put the fish in without getting up from the chair?
[1:41:36] <$RealThiele> he could go catfisting
[1:41:36] <ExpressNode> Gonna need a bigger cooler
[1:41:36] <OwlLightningMage> Tasty tasty last meal
[1:41:38] <willsin4fun> admiral ackbar?

[1:41:39] <+iceballstwitch> catch froggy
[1:41:43] <%Valdorick> wait yeah, why keep the fish if you know you're gonna die?
[1:41:45] <+livi242> this is sad 😭
[1:41:50] <%king_wragles> @MisterAvry force or habit or to not catch it twice I guess
[1:41:53] <%docseuss> @CappuccinoGuil I haven't tried fishing from the chair
[1:41:56] <OwlLightningMage> Last meal
[1:42:00] <@SoFarFetched> @Valdorick "Why not?" Kappa
[1:42:05] <%Mendin> Fresh fish for the guy as a gift maybe
[1:42:05] <aiutare47> A love the lack of music, just wind.
[1:42:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> What a relaxing way to spend your final hours
[1:42:07] <RyanGelatin> @docseuss i have, works great
[1:42:14] <OwlLightningMage> Just swallow the fish whole
[1:42:15] <%docseuss> You are guaranteed to get admiral
[1:42:18] <%docseuss> eventually
[1:42:24] <armchairmaster_> ...this time.
[1:42:28] <IntenseNerdRage> lol
[1:42:30] <+D00msDayDan> this time for sure
[1:42:32] <CappuccinoGuil> @docseuss gotcha. Didn't even notice you could sit in the chair
[1:42:38] <$SGrim> How many catfish can one rural lake have, you may ask. The answer is infinite.
[1:42:41] <CappuccinoGuil> @RyanGelatin sick, I love that
[1:42:51] <+MisterAvry> It's weird to have video gamey "yay fishing" dialogue of a character who's about to punch his ticket
[1:42:55] <$Dakuu75> does he own ALL this land?
[1:42:58] <%bevyrage> wait what if the admiral hangs out beneath that tree on the left?
[1:43:05] <OwlLightningMage> Choke on that pussy fish and get throat cancer
[1:43:09] <AGRO_91> he'll have an admiral's hat, duh
[1:43:12] <KaitlynnHere> So uh.... what’s this game?
[1:43:16] <jorniev> THATS A LOT OF FISH
[1:43:19] <+ghostfaceninja_> when it says "this is a real lunker"
[1:43:24] <+Condaleeza_Rice> I like in some westerns how they pronounce "Adios" with a hard A
[1:43:24] <+livi242> it'll be a waifu
[1:43:27] <T_Sasquatch> The admiral was the friends we made along the way
[1:43:27] <%docseuss> TINY BABY FISH
[1:43:33] <+iceballstwitch> how can one lake have more than 5 fish
[1:43:36] <%shootbang_exe> infinite catfish
[1:43:37] <%bevyrage> admiral has an army after all
[1:43:37] <%Bailey__gaming> Many Fish
[1:43:38] <%kewlmyc> Ponds have a lot of fish, bro
[1:43:40] <%walternatorz> this guy is the most prolific fisherman ever
[1:43:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> Admiral being a fuck
[1:43:46] <tanarath> @kaitlynnhere walk & talk game
[1:43:47] <+JustToWatch> UNLIMITED FISH WORKS
[1:43:48] <Sol_Install> bet its under the pier
[1:43:50] <+livi242> infinite catfish works
[1:43:52] <+Ne0nF0xx> This is where he fishes up Cthulu
[1:43:53] <winner_92> any marine biologists in the chat
[1:43:54] <tanarath> with the emotions
[1:43:58] <%docseuss> (ten fish)
[1:44:01] <T_Sasquatch> Are fish real ?
[1:44:03] <waffleandman> hes gonna take all of the fish with him when he dies
[1:44:08] <blink289> These are either the weakest fish or you are the best fisherman
[1:44:08] <%Monkeyweed21> Fish can't swim
[1:44:08] <+Condaleeza_Rice> chirley
[1:44:08] <ShichiNoBushi> You'll know when it says "Ahoy!"
[1:44:10] <KaitlynnHere> @tanarath looks like it...
[1:44:12] <aiutare47> And they’re all catfish
[1:44:15] <%shootbang_exe> pat single handedly decimating the local catfish population
[1:44:16] <+shad8snake> least he never went hungry
[1:44:16] <dicasmasha> my gpa had a similar sized pond and it had quite a few in it
[1:44:16] <%Valdorick> Deplete the Fish Population before Kira depletes your HP bard.
[1:44:18] <0range_> is this a commentary on overfishing
[1:44:19] <thunderborn32> is someone standing next to that tree?
[1:44:20] <%Valdorick> bar*
[1:44:21] <OwlLightningMage> Fish aren't real if you eyes aren't real
[1:44:24] <+loukemia83> Fish are fake, they are just birds in the water instead of air
[1:44:24] <%furiousfurioso> based on the option I feel like he released live catfish into this lake so he can fish them then release them back
[1:44:24] <+MisterAvry> not a bluegill to be found
[1:44:27] <Theoyveyman> Catch all the fish then use them to bait Godzilla
[1:44:29] <Decimated_body> fishing in games is almost as boring as fishing irl
[1:44:34] <s1rcuit> he's gonna bribe Saint Peter with the fish
[1:44:35] <%xmetalicdemonx> now youll never know
[1:44:40] <%Monkeyweed21> Just like rats, fish cant swim
[1:44:40] <itsmeraggy> now you have to start from scratch and catch all the catfish again
[1:44:40] <OwlLightningMage> Patch the fishing mini game
[1:44:42] <+Ne0nF0xx> I don't want to get political but are birds even real?
[1:44:45] <+ghostfaceninja_> "stocking" lakes with fish is a common thing in places fyi
[1:44:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:44:47] <bahble> let it splash 3 times @PatStaresAt
[1:44:48] <yourliteraldog> Fish are real. It's birds that are a lie
[1:44:49] <%psidefx> at least its not a C+ seabass
[1:44:51] <%wibbwobbler> he can't stop

[1:50:57] <willsin4fun> this dudes kid is a prick
[1:51:01] <T_Sasquatch> @jorniev man im trying to be respectful but im not seeing the game part in this game. The dialogue is fantastic but this may as well be a long cutscene
[1:51:03] <+shad8snake> son going for the jugular
[1:51:04] <RyanGelatin> this game and disco elysium are the only games to make me cry just from the mechanic of choosing words
[1:51:05] <Ice_Ventura549> @docseuss i'm sorry man. it is rough stuff
[1:51:05] <%AncelDeLambert> Billy, fuck you
[1:51:06] <%Taisuru> Fuck that kid

[1:51:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> Bill is kind of a shithead
[1:51:10] <%ssjklyco> It's not an easy decision. My grandmother had to be put in a home cause it is something that needs constant care.
[1:51:16] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Bill stop being such a goddamn zoomer
[1:51:19] <OwlLightningMage> Fuck that kid.

[1:51:25] <%kewlmyc> ....
[1:51:27] <%docseuss> technically bill is gen x
[1:51:31] <T_Sasquatch> Im not seeing how bill is the bad guy here
[1:51:32] <CappuccinoGuil> To whoever said "Why didn't he just take her in?" This was why.
[1:51:35] <Sol_Install> wait she spilled the bens????
[1:51:38] <Sol_Install> beans*
[1:51:38] <+MisterAvry> Bill is angry, and not entirely unjustifed
[1:51:41] <skyentombment> WOW DAD WHY'D YOU PUT OUR MOM IN GOOD CARE INSTEAD OF DEALING WITH IT WITH LITTLE EXPERTISE
[1:51:42] <TurtlesAndTentacles> So why didnt you, the dumbass son take her in your home. Stop being a piece of shit.
[1:51:43] <+thegreenbenis> Aww Jesus this is fucking heavy.
[1:51:46] <$RealThiele> THAT DAY
[1:51:48] <T_Sasquatch> Bill is pretty on point CHAT
[1:51:51] <%AncelDeLambert> so why didn't YOU take her home, Billy?
[1:51:54] <skyentombment> This dude has issues beyond this one
[1:51:54] <studleydoorite> my grandma did that to me when she was going
[1:51:59] <Noogiez> oh shit man
[1:52:01] <%brickwall35> that hour she was lucid
[1:52:01] <%Invlux> Man this is fuckin ROUGH
[1:52:03] <%MisterRockett> @docseuss He's 30 in 1993.
[1:52:04] <aura_00> @T_Sasquatch neither of them are, it's just that in this situation you're made to feel sympathy for the dad
[1:52:05] <jman13131313> This is sad
[1:52:05] <%ChestMimik> I want to punch bill and hug him
[1:52:06] <aiutare47> Props to the devs, first I was like “oh hey this reminds me of home” and now that I’m distracted you’re beating me with a claw hammer.
[1:52:06] <+toxinjustin> helding
[1:52:08] <HeroToxiko> woooooo
[1:52:10] <+Stormzcales_Lair> @turtles yep where was mr. son
[1:52:12] <42nfl19> who is they?
[1:52:14] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Why couldn't YOU take care of her you little shit
[1:52:16] <%toastybites> She was probably a non-hostage hostage
[1:52:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> THEN WHY DIDNT YOU BRING HER HOME
[1:52:20] <%ElkRiverDog> coxThump
[1:52:22] <+MisterAvry> Even this guy is going to agree that Bill is right.
[1:52:23] <%linSP> feeling like that friend sitting in front of my friends parents fighting again
[1:52:25] <yourliteraldog> I was watching pigs eat dead sex workers
[1:52:27] <ToneBacas> the mob
[1:52:28] <CappuccinoGuil> @AncelDeLambert Farmer probably made sure she couldn't be taken in. If the mafia found out she was with Billy, both might've died
[1:52:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> Bill is worse than Jimmy
[1:52:29] <$RenegadeHatter> NotLikeThis
[1:52:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> WHY DIDNT YOU BROUGHT HER
[1:52:31] <%ambig_anti> ADIOS BILL
[1:52:31] <Decimated_body> hmm
[1:52:32] <OwlLightningMage> HOW HARD DO YOU THINK IT WAS FOR YOUR DAD ASSHOLE
[1:52:37] <mike2hands> this is rough
[1:52:37] <%AncelDeLambert> Billy doesn't know fuck about alzhiemers, and he's taking out his own shit on his father so yeah fuck Billy
[1:52:40] <OwlLightningMage> Fuck Bill

[1:52:56] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Bill is a piece of shit.
[1:52:58] <HeroToxiko> @sonofthedeepsouth his father had control over that, the homes take that kind of thing seriously
[1:52:58] <+TheCrispyBoi> fuck him
[1:52:59] <%docseuss> to be fair farmer made bill kill his own pet pig
[1:53:01] <%Taisuru> Fuck bill

[1:53:21] <waffleandman> get off of your high horse bill
[1:53:21] <%Taisuru> "You should have taken her out of there, but >I< won't"
[1:53:21] <%EternalJedi> fuck off, Bill

[1:53:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> pain.....

[1:53:25] <penitentpendant> Man, just a lot of 'feels' games recently
[1:53:25] <DianaTheAscian> wait yeah why doesn't bill take her home then?
[1:53:25] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> i side with bill
[1:53:26] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> I've had to deal with two people wasting away from cancer. Long term care is hell. I couldn't do a third.
[1:53:26] <%bhp_99> Bill probably doesnt know what happened between the dad and mom
[1:53:27] <Sunstalker> It' 92, How much do people know about alzheimers then versus now?
[1:53:28] <sweetestbeefs> Bill only knows his own side. He doesn't know what Pops had to go through
[1:53:28] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Bill cant tell cause he's up his own ass
[1:53:30] <%asgard147> limesFeels
[1:53:31] <CappuccinoGuil> You all hate Bill because you KNOW things he doesn't, chat
[1:53:31] <%Deano8817> oh man
[1:53:31] <armchairmaster_> Bill's not 100% wrong, chat
[1:53:31] <%Emperor_Machinus> a feel good game
[1:53:34] <OwlLightningMage> I'm glad we all hate Bill
[1:53:35] <jorniev> mine had too
[1:53:37] <+WizoSavage> Alzheimer's the literal worse
[1:53:39] <%Jekado> its not great
[1:53:41] <ECRead> mine too...
[1:53:41] <+kmckbxd> i empathize with bill
[1:53:42] <mike2hands> oh man
[1:53:43] <%toastybites> Honestly Bill doesn't know so his reaction is pretty fair
[1:53:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> CQLL DAD PAT
[1:53:44] <+brickwall35> @sunstalker a lot more but still very little
[1:53:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh shit
[1:53:52] <+WizoSavage> My grandma currently has it
[1:53:54] <ShichiNoBushi> You're just playing all the games that hit hard emotionally, lately.
[1:53:56] <+MisterAvry> It's very easy to get upset about someone being mad when you have one side of the story.
[1:53:57] <eco419> BibleThump
[1:53:57] <Sol_Install> this a deep cut call then damn
[1:53:57] <+RealMichaelPhelps> <3
[1:53:58] <%shootbang_exe> yeah my grandma had alzheimer's it was brutaal
[1:54:00] <%Jekado> Alzheimers is true horror to me
[1:54:00] <%Wallabri> fuck alzheimers, fuck it.
[1:54:00] <penitentpendant> In some ways the lucidity makes it hurt all the more
[1:54:02] <tanarath> It's fucking bad.
[1:54:05] <%Bailey__gaming> im sorry pat
[1:54:05] <s1rcuit> I'm fortunate that all of my older relatives never lost their minds before passing
[1:54:08] <HeroToxiko> oh thats that "notebook" stuff
[1:54:10] <%docseuss> For me, writing this scene, what was important was that bill is angry because of what he can't ever know
[1:54:10] <%bhp_99> was so scary when someone you loved looks at you like a total stranger, happened to me with my grandma
[1:54:11] <%AgniBrandt> Man, fuck Twitch for dying during /this/
[1:54:12] <$RealThiele> old people can gain some berserk strength
[1:54:12] <HeroToxiko> oh shit
[1:54:12] <%ConLin_Arts_> dang
[1:54:13] <SilverFeng> that shit is hard
[1:54:13] <%linSP> damn that sucks
[1:54:14] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Its rough bro
[1:54:15] <EmpyreanMAULER> the reason you all hate Bill is because you're seeing it from this man's perspective
[1:54:15] <Vadrigar1994> Oh shit
[1:54:16] <Noogiez> damn yo
[1:54:17] <OwlLightningMage> It's not easy for anyone. I hate that Bill is acting like it was
[1:54:17] <reonome> pretty sure my grandma doesn't remember me either
[1:54:19] <%RyTYoung> I'm there with you bud, my grandad ended up forgetting me too, it's tough
[1:54:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BibleThump
[1:54:22] <%asgard147> I'm sorry Pat
[1:54:22] <balthazar758> this is not an easy black and white situation. none of you would know what to do either.
[1:54:24] <tanarath> It's bad.
[1:54:24] <Meltgar> fuuuck
[1:54:24] <%CopperTucker> this is my fear, that I'll just forget
[1:54:24] <%walternatorz> That's the toughest
[1:54:25] <%josstil> yup
[1:54:25] <%EternalJedi> one of my grandma's got it too, after grandpa passed, she was never lucid, thought my sister was my mom and forgot me entirely
[1:54:28] <pmda2126> I'm so sorry
[1:54:31] <%josstil> my grandmother has it
[1:54:31] <T_Sasquatch> That's rough
[1:54:35] <%ringabal> For the people saying Bill's a dick, just think about it for a minute
[1:54:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> FUCK
[1:54:35] <%Deano8817> holy shit
[1:54:36] <Sol_Install> fuck
[1:54:37] <AmuserName> that's really fucking painful.
[1:54:38] <+thegreenbenis> Oooh shit, that's heavy.
[1:54:38] <blue8moon> my grandpa had it too
[1:54:39] <%Invlux> That's super rough dude, I'm sorry
[1:54:40] <%brickwall35> fuck
[1:54:40] <Pookiedaexzile> I'm sorry
[1:54:40] <eco419> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[1:54:41] <Sol_Install> this is heavy
[1:54:41] <+CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt Do you think Bill is justified?
[1:54:41] <%Taisuru> My grandpa thought I was my dad
[1:54:42] <%josstil> it's hard
[1:54:43] <+Rofiarf> ouch
[1:54:44] <theshillman> yeah that happens
[1:54:44] <HeroToxiko> BibleThump
[1:54:44] <nevan_44> :(
[1:54:46] <%Alazull> Fuck man
[1:54:46] <%saadi90> Sorry man. That’s rough
[1:54:47] <+WizoSavage> It's the worst
[1:54:48] <vilecrois> Yep
[1:54:48] <%RyTYoung> It's real bad BibleThump <3
[1:54:49] <+thegreenbenis> Damn I didn't expect this to hit so close to home.
[1:54:50] <TurtlesAndTentacles> This is making me cry for your family Pat
[1:54:50] <+caramelatte1> Experienced that shit, its awful
[1:54:50] <sougoe> This hits the feels hard after my parents just divorced
[1:54:50] <OwlLightningMage> Fuck Bill.
[1:54:51] <theshillman> it's so bad
[1:54:51] <jorniev> YES its REEAL BAD
[1:54:52] <Decimated_body> my grandma had it
[1:54:52] <+MisterAvry> People do shitty things in life and sometimes those are unforgivable. Bill has no obligation to be nice about this
[1:54:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> thats horrible
[1:54:54] <%Emperor_Machinus> @PatStaresAt My Grandmother had dementia. It broke my heart when I left the room and she forgot who I was.
[1:54:55] <%Taisuru> FUCK NO
[1:54:56] <%Jekado> Its a difficult situation
[1:54:56] <jman13131313> NO
[1:54:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Fuck Bill
[1:54:58] <Visorak6> From his perspective of the situation
[1:54:59] <SilverFeng> bill is kinda justified
[1:54:59] <blue8moon> eventually we just stopped visiting because he didn't know who we were
[1:55:00] <%josstil> for his knowledge of the situation, sure
[1:55:00] <+thelonechris> No
[1:55:01] <mike2hands> yes and no
[1:55:02] <RyuuAoi> bleedPurple bleedPurple
[1:55:02] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Just understandable
[1:55:03] <%EternalJedi> I just want to be put down if I get alzheimers, I don't want to put anyone through that shit
[1:55:03] <%toastybites> YES
[1:55:03] <$RealThiele> I think bill is just as wrong
[1:55:03] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Diseases that eat your mind aren't happy
[1:55:04] <+TheCrispyBoi> fuck bill
[1:55:06] <%ChestMimik> I understand Bill's frustration but also fuck him
[1:55:07] <@SoFarFetched> I mean one of the options was the wife started screaming at bill cause she couldn't recognize him.
[1:55:07] <+luftraumm1> alzheimers and dementia are brutal as fuck
[1:55:09] <%AncelDeLambert> Bill is taking his anguish out on his father
[1:55:09] <ergulor> i remember one of my great aunts replacing my mother with my aunts dog
[1:55:09] <%Jekado> there is a stigmata also with "putting someone in a home"
[1:55:09] <%rekinom> my grandma thought i was my father
[1:55:13] <@SoFarFetched> sorry not bill the main character*
[1:55:14] <+pectusumbra> It's pain. There's nothing RIGHT here.
[1:55:16] <+Plus_On_Black> damn
[1:55:19] <%asgard147> Yeah that's fucked up
[1:55:20] <studleydoorite> it feels like they're gone before they really go, my grandma kept asking for me then she'd say "I don't know you" when she saw me
[1:55:20] <%RyTYoung> itsbad
[1:55:21] <younger54> Alzheimers is the scariest thing ever
[1:55:22] <yourliteraldog> He had the chance in the call
[1:55:25] <+MisterAvry> Yeah, he kept him in the dark on everything and just things be shitty. Bill is totally right
[1:55:25] <%bhp_99> yeah
[1:55:26] <%josstil> yup
[1:55:27] <$RenegadeHatter> I mean, Bill doesn't know whats about to happen
[1:55:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Bill Could have taken his mother
[1:55:28] <aura_00> Bill is justified, even if it doesn't feel like it
[1:55:31] <%Taisuru> But why didn't bill taker her from the home if it was so damn important to him?
[1:55:31] <+TheCrispyBoi> nah fuck him tho
[1:55:31] <%ssjklyco> My grandmother was not even aware my grandfather passed while at the funeral.
[1:55:32] <tanarath> There's a history.
[1:55:34] <%Ranryu692> It really seems like Bill didn't try to learn the reason
[1:55:38] <+JustToWatch> Chat if this game was taking place from Bill's perspective you would all be saying fuck farmer
[1:55:39] <%Valdorick> Bill found her on his own. So Pa never told Bill even where she WAS, so Bill is right.
[1:55:39] <+CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt I totally agree
[1:55:40] <+MisterAvry> Learn perspective, teens
[1:55:41] <%linSP> its kinda fucky
[1:55:46] <+loukemia83> Bill clearly never saw how bad she was if he brushed off Azlheimers like he did
[1:55:52] <Decimated_body> MUH GOATS
[1:55:53] <sougoe> Bill is venting possibly YEARS of frustration
[1:55:54] <missingangle> In a sense, maybe, but pointing the blame onto the father and not taking a second to grasp his dad's perspective of what happened with the mom, still sucks.
[1:55:55] <T_Sasquatch> Chat being chat LUL
[1:55:55] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt I feel like Woolie will hate this game cause its anti-just talk
[1:55:56] <aiutare47> I’m going to call my parents holy shit
[1:55:57] <%pepzi_boyz> pepzi_boyz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! family drama is always fun!
[1:55:57] <@commanderclaw> This is making me feel like I need to lie down
[1:56:01] <%Valdorick> Though Pa LIKELY wanted her to not talk about what he was feeding the pigs with.
[1:56:01] <Decimated_body> MUH GOATS SON
[1:56:02] <%Mr_Pylon> in Bill's place the farmer could have stopped farming
[1:56:04] <nomolomo> its also not exactly a black and white scenario where one is 100% wrong and the other is 100% right
[1:56:04] <%AgniBrandt> Bill is behaving correctly based on the imperfect information he has
[1:56:06] <jorniev> i agree
[1:56:08] <%wibbwobbler> dude was prob embarrassed, pretty bad look
[1:56:08] <leinadtonu> perspective changes so many things.
[1:56:10] <%ringabal> "Hey Bill, I work for the mob. That bacon's got people in it!"
[1:56:10] <sweetestbeefs> I need a drink
[1:56:11] <CappuccinoGuil> And remember, chat, Farmer's reaction to Bill visiting her is "OH FUCK, DID SHE TALK?"
[1:56:11] <tanarath> or maybe his wife saw something
[1:56:13] <%Deano8817> every where at the end of time monkaS
[1:56:15] <%Monkeyweed21> Read Jojolion everyone
[1:56:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's not like he couldn't have at least TRIED to tell Bill
[1:56:15] <cherrycottontail> I mean, maybe if you don't know what alzheimers is
[1:56:16] <%MisterRockett> If the mom spilled something in an alheimerz induced state that would have been the end of the entire family.
[1:56:17] <RyanGelatin> edith is a slightly more fun call
[1:56:17] <+loukemia83> Like Bill has not had to deal with someone who has had it, if he says "Alzheimer's is not a big deal"
[1:56:18] <+JustToWatch> also the Dad making Bill kill his pet pig
[1:56:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @commanderclaw same.....and im already lying down
[1:56:29] <balthazar758> pretty much. chill out with the capslock
[1:56:29] <tanarath> Something she shouldn't have.
[1:56:34] <+ghostfaceninja_> guys, the dad has some responsibility to tell the son the whole truth
[1:56:34] <armchairmaster_> Bill's lacking critical info, he's not an asshole
[1:56:37] <aura_00> @missingangle he's clearly still hurting from the loss, he's being irrational sure, but it's a situation where he should be
[1:56:38] <%Wallabri> our character couldn't tell Bill where his mom was cause then Bill would be in danger if his mom told him about the dad's Business :c
[1:56:42] <KaitlynnHere> So what’s going to happen to your character?
[1:56:42] <+MisterAvry> As someone who had neglectful and abusive parents, one of which shot himself, fuck this farmer. Feeling sorry 20min before your suicide is bullshit.
[1:56:44] <CappuccinoGuil> Best girl, Edie
[1:56:45] <%linSP> oooof
[1:56:47] <GarbageQueenEllie> @loukemia83 That's why Bill seems shitty to me.
[1:56:51] <T_Sasquatch> Yup
[1:56:54] <reonome> i'm gonna be DEAD edith
[1:56:55] <HeroToxiko> he's visiting family alright monkaS
[1:56:55] <%docseuss> When Farmer said "I did everything for you" he wasn't lying
[1:56:55] <OwlLightningMage> Permanently out of town
[1:57:02] <%Alazull> I remember when I disappeared to my grandma, she thought she was a secretary in LA still. She thought I was trying to date her

[2:05:07] <KaitlynnHere> Mhmm, meth
[2:05:11] <itsmeraggy> good strategy, make the hitman feel extra bad for killing a man who can't cook
[2:05:16] <balthazar758> breaking bad lol
[2:05:17] <$RealThiele> paige do not let him cook he uses the floor to season
[2:05:17] <armchairmaster_> [MOOD AT RISK]

[2:05:31] <+D00msDayDan> cooking is creative, pat can't do it
[2:05:32] <+JustToWatch> honestly the janky cooking kind of helps to add an emotional breathing point
[2:05:34] <%walternatorz> I'm surprised he didn't cut the peas.
[2:05:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> THE MOMENT IS GONE
[2:05:37] <+BallerSwagBro9k> WHERE IS THE LAMB SAUCE?
[2:05:39] <%ringabal> Little bit, huh?

[2:05:58] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Very nice of Pat to give us a break from all the emotions LUL
[2:05:58] <aiutare47> @docseuss was this intentional pacing wise, to break up the mood or is pat just a scrub lord?
[2:05:59] <%Taisuru> 1 at a time
[2:06:05] <%Piemono> hahaha
[2:06:06] <+Rofiarf> pat what are you making?

[2:06:17] <%Broand> Click the pot with the veggies or whatever
[2:06:18] <%Mendin> I think pat is trying to cook all three meals atr once
[2:06:19] <adzy2k6> i think the potato from the steak dish was supposed to be microwaved
[2:06:19] <penitentpendant> @Rofiarf A mess
[2:06:20] <%walternatorz> mmmm warm floor potatoes
[2:06:20] <CappuccinoGuil> @Rofiarf stew, from the looks of it

[2:06:33] <%MelBrooksKA> @SoFarFetched Yeah, just throw some salt and cumin on the floor and throw the stuff on it
[2:06:34] <%bhp_99> why are you microwaving when you cook it in the pot, right?
[2:06:34] <%docseuss> we're working on fixing it
[2:06:35] <OwlLightningMage> IT'S FUCKING RAW
[2:06:38] <$Dakuu75> dropping all the ingredients on the floor... the tension is COMPLETELY fucking gone now, lmao

[2:07:15] <thunderborn32> curry powder
[2:07:15] <bahble> it's the glitch
[2:07:17] <+thegreenbenis> Curry powder.

[2:09:53] <%luftraumm1> imagine not wearing the steak in the pan you are going to stew it in
[2:09:55] <yourliteraldog> Its good
[2:09:58] <aiutare47> Some does
[2:09:58] <nevan_44> someone call gordon he is crying

[2:10:00] <%JoshManVGH> it can
[2:10:02] <+pectusumbra> the book literally says to microwave the potatoes
[2:10:05] <OwlLightningMage> Gordon Ramsay has been quiet since Pat starting chopping shit in the fridge
[2:10:07] <%Broand> Look at steak recipe
[2:10:08] <adzy2k6> @PatStaresAt You are only supposed to microwave them for the steak
[2:10:08] <Top_Lane_Duelist> IRL i think thye mesn
[2:10:10] <%Alazull> @docseuss Was it there in the early 90s?
[2:10:12] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Man, I could go for another stew. The beef stew I had was baller
[2:10:12] <%AgniBrandt> You only microwave potato for the bottom left recipe
[2:10:12] <CappuccinoGuil> Oooooh potatoes are microwaved FOR THE STEAK
[2:10:13] <+Rofiarf> only for the steak
[2:10:16] <jorniev> EATING SOME POTATES?
[2:10:19] <$RealThiele> FLOORTATOES
[2:10:19] <%Monkeyweed21> thats for Steak
[2:10:20] <+Condaleeza_Rice> I microwave a potato to make a backed potato
[2:10:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> Apparently in this game potatoes cook in microwave.
[2:10:20] <RyuuAoi> Thai curry is delicious
[2:10:21] <Bearheart223> For Steak you microwave!
[2:10:21] <%toastybites> @pectusumbra for steak though
[2:10:21] <LeotheHuntsman> has pat never cooked in a pot before?
[2:10:21] <+iceballstwitch> dont forget to tell peach that she's your wife today
[2:10:22] <+MisterAvry> I think the idea is you keep the potato whole and nuke it to have a baked potato with steak
[2:10:23] <OwlLightningMage> JUST MAKE EVERYTHING

[2:10:35] <%brickwall35> follow the recipe jesus fuck it isn't hard
[2:10:36] <+Saggitori> i microwave my potatoes. it's faster than boiling
[2:10:36] <%luftraumm1> you need to sear steak in the pan you are going to cook, otherwise you lose the fond
[2:10:38] <%mikessdd> It's for the Steak with potatoes and peas. Not the Stew or the curry
[2:10:39] <%ringabal> That hitman's gonna walk in watching Pat fumble in the kitchen
[2:10:39] <%baronblank> I think you only microwave the potatoes if you're having the "Steak" meal instead of stew or curry

[2:14:08] <%UvBenServed> lol
[2:14:10] <jorniev> not even to off yourself?
[2:14:11] <+Rofiarf> he was prepared to die
[2:14:12] <CappuccinoGuil> Chat, what did you expect, he was gonna sit down and talk? HE DID THAT THE WHOLE GAME
[2:14:14] <+MisterAvry> So Skinny Head Guy blasted him?
[2:14:14] <YellowJacketKaraguchi> @RenegadeHatter the gun was to make it look like he fought back
[2:14:15] <%mikessdd> Love the pig noises
[2:14:16] <%asgard147> Make it look like a suicide
[2:14:17] <$Dakuu75> this was basically a suiicide, right?
[2:14:17] <Palmtuna> I jump in, catch an ad, return to credits...
[2:14:17] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> the farm knew and prepare the sence for them
[2:14:18] <+BigCoffee> assited suicide
[2:14:19] <+PlatinumRevol> If hitman hadn't done it he would have shot himself
[2:14:20] <%wibbwobbler> why shotgun?
[2:14:20] <OwlLightningMage> I don't like that ending. It was too fast.
[2:14:20] <HeroToxiko> i he was gonna do it himself thats why the shotgun was there i think
[2:14:21] <waffleandman> fed to the pigs D:
[2:14:21] <thehullowed> The pigs are not helping...
[2:14:21] <%AyotoCorp> Is this the Colorado mission from Hitman 1
[2:14:22] <%AgniBrandt> That is EXACTLY the kind of scene I'd expect from the Paratopic dev
[2:14:23] <Decimated_body> PIGS EATING YOU NOW
[2:14:23] <%EternalJedi> Ending A, time for route B?
[2:14:23] <%brickwall35> is there actually a way to live?
[2:14:23] <%toastybites> the gun was to make it look like a suicide
[2:14:23] <ShichiNoBushi> I wasn't paying enough attention. Did he hire those guys to kill him?
[2:14:23] <RyuuAoi> The point is to die
[2:14:27] <%ChestMimik> Pat why didn't you activate your stand?
[2:14:27] <%docseuss> the gun is unloaded people
[2:14:27] <%linSP> maybe he did it for you because he liked you
[2:14:30] <%ssjklyco> Does this imply they fed you to the pigs?
[2:14:31] <+MisterAvry> It's kinda like The Departed. He just accepted it
[2:14:32] <s1rcuit> for the folks who don't understand the player character WANTED to die
[2:14:32] <%JoshManVGH> But then why the shoygun?
[2:14:32] <jorniev> its still a video game
[2:14:33] <aura_00> @baka_sugoi a shotgun and a pistol make very dfferent holes
[2:14:33] <$Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt can you please explain this story in a summary. I'm a dumbass
[2:14:33] <%Puhff> then why have it?
[2:14:33] <willsin4fun> ah yes a pump action shotgun will being there will clearly make it look like suicide, when he has a wound from a pistol roumd
[2:14:36] <%Taisuru> He didn't seem to want to
[2:14:36] <OwlLightningMage> Like literally take 2 extra seconds.
[2:14:37] <RyuuAoi> A BAY OF PIGS
[2:14:38] <%docseuss> he's telling the hitman that he could fight back and he is choosing not to
[2:14:40] <%luftraumm1> they were friends so farmer made it easy
[2:14:40] <+CptBritches> But the shotgun wouldn't match the bullet so making it look like a suicide wouldn't make sense
[2:14:40] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt i didn't get why he grabbed the shotgun then
[2:14:41] <ToneBacas> suicide by 9mm shot to the chest with this 12 gauge shotgun
[2:14:43] <solracc25> Does it have alternate endings?
[2:14:44] <dukenux> chat have you watched what they talked about before
[2:14:45] <BakerBrute> Fill your mouth with Stew so when he shoots you, delicous microwaved potato gunk sprays his suit
[2:14:46] <CappuccinoGuil> The shells are all over the table
[2:14:47] <%Mr_Pylon> my take is that he prepped the shotgun for the hitman to use on his body
[2:14:47] <+ghostfaceninja_> I mean, we got our way either way so ...
[2:14:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> did you even get to finish your stew?
[2:14:51] <theshillman> oh i thought those were zangief noises
[2:14:55] <supergoblinpunch> Last meal for Pigs too
[2:14:57] <$Dakuu75> Oh... ok
[2:14:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> A SHOTGUN SUIC8DE WITH PISTOL WOUNDS LUL

[2:15:03] <%Monkeyweed21> make it look like a burglary
[2:15:07] <sleepy_pixels> Should have chose the curry ending

[2:15:08] <%brickwall35> are you able to live?

[2:19:29] <%docseuss> if you don't buy the game i can't
[2:19:30] <%MelBrooksKA> Perhaps the real sadman were the sadmans we fed to pigs along the way
[2:19:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> PAT CALLS HIS DAD
[2:19:31] <AGRO_91> better writing than anything david cage has done thats for damn sure

[2:19:56] <+JustToWatch> @docseuss I got that, but how would selling the farm and moving to the city be that different from just not feeding the bodies to the pigs?
[2:20:07] <Ice_Ventura549> LUL
[2:20:09] <%luftraumm1> @docseuss yeaaaaaaaaaasaaaah
[2:20:10] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Hey @docseuss whats your twitter?

[2:20:40] <%SuckerPunchSyd> 👍🏾👍🏾
[2:20:40] <missingangle> I was texting my dad during the scene with Bill. Just pure coincidence, we were already chatting, but like ouch.
[2:20:45] <%docseuss> at the start of Sol's game when Jimmy is cutting down the chestnut tree, the mob takes over the farm
[2:20:48] <+JustToWatch> @docseuss oh he meant "sell it to us", got it
[2:20:53] <aiutare47> @docseuss Also if you make mob games, make sure someone is named Sonny. I had two cousins picked up for racketeering, everyone in the Buffalo mob was named Sonny, Sal, or Sam.
[2:20:55] <jorniev> Man this game makes me feel like life is strange is kinda, like its weirdly more inmature
[2:21:01] <%blaccbird914> @docseuss really job on the writing drummed up alot of things for me
[2:21:08] <%EternalJedi> docseuss can you play it over and over and have those greyed out dialogue options selectable? or are they just a narrative thing
[2:21:08] <+Haruo30> @docseuss I just bought a copy of the game hope you get to make more and good luck.
[2:21:10] <%Puhff> @docseuss if you were an orange tabby cat, what would your name be?

[2:21:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat is shitting
[2:21:35] <DianaTheAscian> BIG PISS
[2:21:37] <%justcallmebobplease> @docseus across your crazy pitches you have or intend to make real, have you ever had any of the 'by having a save file of a later game, you unlock an alternate story route in a prior game' pitches?  It's my white whale and you sound crazy enough.
[2:21:37] <balthazar758> pat and the piss takes
[2:21:42] <%Daxalog> Timing
[2:21:45] <skyentombment> @jorniev Yeah, cuz Life is Hella is mature as hell!
[2:21:51] <+CptBritches> @docseuss At the end with the MC bringing the shotgun to the table, was that to imply that he was goin to kill himself and the hitman just beat him to it or was he just setting it up to stage a suicide?
[2:21:54] <@SoFarFetched> geefGasp

[2:29:37] <ergulor> supposedly they did
[2:29:38] <KaitlynnHere> I dunno
[2:29:38] <skyentombment> SOMETIMES
[2:29:40] <OwlLightningMage> @blink289 I keep pushing kenshi
[2:29:42] <deviljhojho_> its possible
[2:29:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> They nerfed it slightly
[2:29:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea they did
[2:29:47] <aiutare47> Difficulty is subjective
[2:29:47] <+iceballstwitch> this is the last one isn't it?
[2:29:47] <%cvp5127> @PatStaresAt any thoughts on sony buying evo
[2:29:49] <KaitlynnHere> Turn it down?
[2:29:57] <%ssjklyco> Is it Hard but satisfying, or hard and frustrating?
[2:29:58] <susukouhai> a WOOOAP boop is not bad
[2:30:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> They nerfed Part 1 a little bit people say
[2:30:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Long Hard fights are optional in part 2 @patstaresat
[2:30:02] <@SoFarFetched> why not
[2:30:04] <%weissguard> Same tbh
[2:30:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Smash is Dead
[2:30:08] <deviljhojho_> next evo is gonna be play station all stars 9 times
[2:30:09] <DianaTheAscian> people are mad?
[2:30:10] <softbirby> @OwlLightningMage kenshi is so good
[2:30:12] <%baka_sugoi> EVO is BACK
[2:30:15] <%Taisuru> As in fighting games Evo?
[2:30:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> people think this affects smash for some reason
[2:30:16] <%asgard147> Wait, they bought it? When?
[2:30:17] <Djinnazz> no
[2:30:18] <RyuuAoi> Does it matter?
[2:30:19] <$RealThiele> evo was a garbage hole of BO since forever
[2:30:20] <NekoZen> Core Values
[2:30:20] <%SaiyanShoto> I don’t get it either
[2:30:24] <@SoFarFetched> @asgard147 was announced today
[2:30:25] <blink289> @OwlLightningMage that game is depressingly hard to start. He'd have to offstream at least a couple sessions first
[2:30:26] <+loukemia83> Sam Sho wasn't even out and got it
[2:30:26] <%walternatorz> does this mean Sony is due for some kind of scandal?
[2:30:28] <sweetestbeefs> it's great for the fg community as a whole, people just don't like big companies, for good reasons
[2:30:28] <%wibbwobbler> good for evo?
[2:30:28] <OwlLightningMage> I love Kenshi. That's why I keep pushing it
[2:30:29] <%Ranryu692> people seem to think that it's going to be Sony games only eventually
[2:30:30] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt or bbtag
[2:30:30] <a_mad_dragon_> just go to PAX 4Head
[2:30:30] <jman13131313> why not?
[2:30:33] <Tuna_Can_0> Im just curious what might change
[2:30:33] <aiutare47> @deviljhojho_ I’d watch the shit out of that
[2:30:33] <%cvp5127> rip smash?
[2:30:33] <deviljhojho_> i dont think it really matters
[2:30:34] <s1rcuit> sounds good to me, means they have access to funding
[2:30:34] <DrunkenDice> EVO got bought?!?!?!
[2:30:34] <%BluBox> A lot of people that are mad didn't read the actual article about it
[2:30:35] <vilecrois> But Paaaat now they can't play smash Kappa
[2:30:35] <%Taisuru> I more don't understand why they'd bother :V
[2:30:40] <RyuuAoi> Sony is fighting games now. Been that way tbh
[2:30:41] <+RyanTheRecluse> wait evo didn't die last year?
[2:30:41] <+SH1NK1R0> i thought it was me. i took a break before the dlc came outand when i booted it up i was getting wrecked. even accounting for rust it felt really tough

[2:39:53] <%ospreyworks> gdi square
[2:39:55] <Tuna_Can_0> @linSP I guess so. But without bosses and more logistics and trains
[2:39:57] <%mikessdd> I'll just keep watching this until my friend is ready to play Apex I suppose
[2:40:06] <Ipsenscastle> fuck Japan's phone obsession, they were supposed to be the chosen ones
[2:41:10] <Tuna_Can_0> factorios mega bases are always cool to see since it's less stress on the PC. so mega bases go MILES
[2:41:57] <OwlLightningMage> Good sign
[2:42:00] <Rionxgarland> factorio gives me anxiety
[2:42:07] <@SoFarFetched> nice time to test factorio before tomorrow then
[2:42:11] <$RealThiele> being bitchy is hard
[2:42:12] <%Emperor_Machinus> He rages against god

[2:42:12] <Yrefe> yep that's the factorio experience
[2:42:13] <Tuna_Can_0> how?
[2:42:17] <mikessdd> That is the way
[2:42:18] <Rionxgarland> maybe he had his tantrum becuase he did not want to fall asleep
[2:42:24] <%AncelDeLambert> time for Pat to begin his journey to BUS
[2:42:27] <%Deft_Thought> Little kids always get rowdy and angsty before going to sleep
[2:42:32] <TheFramedWarlock> The Factory must G R O W
[2:42:33] <%AncelDeLambert> Become HUGE, become as BUS
[2:42:38] <%walternatorz> he must replenish his strength so he can tantrum again
[2:42:40] <Tuna_Can_0> ive never had it crash huh
[2:42:41] <+BusterRepukken> my doom eternal game just crashed mid challenge wave
[2:42:42] <RyuuAoi> For now
[2:42:43] <%Ranryu692> maybe he had the tantrum so that he COULD fall asleep
[2:42:45] <+BusterRepukken> very salty

[2:44:37] <+BusterRepukken> your dog sounds like my dad
[2:44:39] <Ipsenscastle> i didnt realise this would be so bugcentric
[2:44:45] <doster504> I thought Gief was the aliens
[2:44:46] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> brood war was peak blizzard and it was only downhill from there

[2:47:06] <%weissguard> psaDogchamp
[2:47:07] <OwlLightningMage> Time to jerk onto fish eggs to repopulate humanity
[2:47:13] <Laioken13> is he using the infinite resource mod so his goblins don't ruin it for him
[2:47:15] <RyuuAoi> Maybe he sees a ghost?
[2:47:18] <+JustToWatch> he is a fussy boy
[2:47:18] <jorniev> WHAT IS WITH DOGGY

[2:47:30] <%walternatorz> He knows his nuts are on the chopping block
[2:47:31] <%Ziegsy> this game looks adorable
[2:47:31] <%baka_sugoi> WASD
[2:47:33] <%asgard147> "I WANT THINGS! ALL THE THINGS!" psaDogchamp
[2:47:39] <RyuuAoi> Give baby a toy! Or treat!
[2:47:42] <yourliteraldog> Nah it's just your basements haunted
[2:47:42] <%mikessdd> Someone already said. He's mad at EVO
[2:47:43] <thesubgenius912> I think he is angry at all the sad energy from Adios
[2:47:43] <%Mr_Pylon> he's just mad that the Adios pigs got a free meal and he didn't
[2:47:45] <Slim_Lipid> that's a "trying to not shit your pants" run
[2:47:46] <RyuuAoi> Maybe he needs to poo
[2:47:49] <Noogiez> this game looks pretty cool
[2:47:56] <jorniev> maybe he thinks you are talking to him?
[2:47:59] <%Ziegsy> Saw paiges tweet, Now I want to hug the gief
[2:48:04] <4n_D> hey pat im wearing the same pjs
[2:48:08] <4n_D> unless thats a kilt
[2:48:18] <OwlLightningMage> Gief wanted all that tasty murder meat in Adios
[2:48:38] <+iceballstwitch> wow
[2:48:59] <%mikessdd> rUnEsCaPe
[2:49:41] <CappuccinoGuil> How soon until [GUN]?
[2:49:52] <%Ziegsy> @Slim_Lipid Its more 'Ive crapped the briefs but the trousers might still be saved' kind of run
[2:49:57] <+D00msDayDan> no mercy for tree
[2:50:08] <%Arweynn> [The trees will remember that.]
[2:50:12] <RyuuAoi> Who talking shit about Gief? I'll kick your ass
[2:50:15] <CappuccinoGuil> Dude, is it weird this is giving me Fallout 1 vibes?
[2:50:17] <%Daxalog> Does satisfactory have artillery trains or drone swarms?
[2:50:18] <cherrycottontail> You madman, that was the last american chestnut
[2:50:22] <KShirahama> kill all trees
[2:50:24] <%Monkeyweed21> """""""homage""""""
[2:50:32] <Calamity2007> This arstyle reminds me a bit of Command & Conquer, specifically the Tiberium Sun and Red Alert 2 era
[2:50:33] <%toastybites> @CappuccinoGuil nah its the dirt man
[2:50:35] <Laioken13> so that noise is the dog
[2:50:42] <%MelBrooksKA> @Daxalog Last update added drones
[2:50:44] <PinoProxie> lol
[2:50:52] <RyuuAoi> @laioken13 It's Peach
[2:50:58] <ammobasket> hmmmmmmmmmmm
[2:51:05] <Psyramics> stone not coal
[2:51:08] <s1rcuit> well factorio came first so odds are Satisfactory copied it
[2:51:09] <$RealThiele> that warhammer totally ripped off warcraft
[2:51:10] <%Daxalog> Metal pat
[2:51:11] <+D00msDayDan> @MelBrooksKA they're not like factorio drones though, just long distance low capacity air transport
[2:51:13] <+TheBitingIrish> Peach is squeegee-ing the windows :)
[2:51:18] <CappuccinoGuil> @toastybites also the way the character looks around and the weird 3d model in ortographic view is just... messing with me
[2:51:19] <@PeachSaliva> @laioken13 it’s my butthole doing fat rips sorry guys
[2:51:21] <%luftraumm1> yo I never knew you started this game as a Dude
[2:51:24] <Calamity2007> Those are some noisy but adorable snores
[2:51:24] <+willsg98> hey there, just stopping by to say hi. i need to go sleep. Have fun with whatever you're doing!
[2:51:34] <CappuccinoGuil> Isometric* fuck
[2:51:34] <%Ziegsy> Its odd, if it was a human snoring like that it could be annoying, but because it is dog it is adorable
[2:51:35] <RyuuAoi> Is this Pat's mining game that he keeps on all night?
[2:51:42] <echobee_tv> @willsg98 have a good sleep!
[2:51:48] <@PeachSaliva> @willsg98 night night dear
[2:51:50] <%goose_attack_almanac> @PeachSaliva Nice, very bassy. You take care of yourself.
[2:51:56] <OwlLightningMage> The ability to make butt boops runs in the Paige family
[2:52:04] <@PeachSaliva> @goose_attack_almanac my butthole is strong
[2:52:15] <Laioken13> @PeachSaliva oh no i'm not mad don't bully me
[2:52:19] <%goose_attack_almanac> Powerful
[2:52:22] <skyentombment> @PeachSaliva Consider some baking soda and water , Peaches, helps with the braps
[2:52:24] <@Pandora_Prime> Paige pls
[2:52:26] <ToneBacas> is this cryptomining?
[2:52:28] <%toastybites> @CappuccinoGuil yeh im getting red alert vibes too
[2:52:36] <Ipsenscastle> @PeachSaliva was that in response to them saying 'bassy'?
[2:52:38] <%Ziegsy> @PeachSaliva I thought the noise was you practicing your french
[2:52:40] <@PeachSaliva> @laioken13 lol I’m not bullying I’m just fartin
[2:52:41] <+TheBitingIrish> Shame all your strength went into your sphincter instead of your spine @PeachSaliva
[2:52:42] <@SoFarFetched> @PeachSaliva is that how you swoon the ladies? geefPlz
[2:52:42] <echobee_tv> How is elmo doing?
[2:52:44] <%luftraumm1> @peachsaliva you in the chat tonight!!!
[2:52:59] <@PeachSaliva> @sofarfetched rorapiHam
[2:53:01] <$HairballCT> press F to pay respects to the gaia you're waging war on LUL
[2:53:07] <Calamity2007> I am interested in seeing how this compares to Satisfactory. It seems like a top down view like this might be less visually impressive but easier to keep track of everything
[2:53:20] <+TheBitingIrish> HE's up and ready to go!
[2:53:20] <%Ziegsy> Sleep bark?!
[2:53:26] <+D00msDayDan> you can also put the furnace right in front of the drill and it'll dump straight into the furnace
[2:53:26] <Calamity2007> Woof
[2:53:31] <Laioken13> bork
[2:53:35] <RyuuAoi> @peachsaliva What you doing for Easter? Church?
[2:53:36] <Psyramics> good job!
[2:53:36] <ToneBacas> beat the game!
[2:53:44] <%ElkRiverDog> psaDogchamp sipsipHonk
[2:53:44] <OwlLightningMage> Elmo is probably plotting his revenge against Gief right now.
[2:53:46] <Ipsenscastle> honestly the real question for me is if this one has coffee
[2:53:49] <skyentombment> @PeachSaliva Here, we get proof of what I said on twitter before: No one in the Boivin household holds it in, not the animals nor the humans
[2:53:59] <DianaTheAscian> ghost
[2:54:02] <%mikessdd> Oh that's the whole game? Alright easy
[2:54:05] <balthazar758> yeah, tell 'em zangief.
[2:54:06] <%thbluewarden> thbluewarden subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:54:14] <$RealThiele> LUL
[2:54:18] <RyuuAoi> It's fine. He probably just wants attention
[2:54:18] <%AncelDeLambert> here's a fun trick for all the noobs: grab a burner miner, put it on coal, and then put another burner miner in front of it. The first will fuel the second. Now point them at each other.
[2:54:24] <RyuuAoi> Let him speak
[2:54:30] <@Pandora_Prime> @peachsaliva So concerning your butthole._.
[2:54:48] <@PeachSaliva> @pandora_prime Pando please you’re always asking about my bhole
[2:54:56] <Bluecille> @AncelDeLambert that sounds like some troll physics nonsense
[2:54:57] <balthazar758> it speaks the truth
[2:54:58] <+Jekado> @AncelDeLambert kinky...
[2:54:59] <@SoFarFetched> please please not in front of the children you two geefBruh
[2:55:00] <%Ziegsy> Im curious of the barking is her butthole too
[2:55:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> @AncelDeLambert Perpetual motion discovered?
[2:55:15] <%driemen> driemen subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Hi Pat, I had a weird dream where you were a tiny goblin batman (patman) and paige was robin and plague was alfred. Begrudging Pat-Man was quite an adventure to behold
[2:55:16] <@SoFarFetched> chat barely knows about buttholes
[2:55:21] <s1rcuit> @ReallyBigRocks until the coal runs out
[2:55:30] <aiutare47> When do the bugaboos arrive?
[2:55:31] <Ipsenscastle> i don't even know what a butthole is
[2:55:35] <Ipsenscastle> I am pure
[2:55:35] <Yakobro> GUN
[2:55:35] <CappuccinoGuil> Holy shit, this is making me brain release the happy juice.
[2:55:36] <+smjoao> GUN
[2:55:36] <RyuuAoi> @sofarfetched Please. I'm an expert KappaPride
[2:55:37] <+D00msDayDan> GUN
[2:55:37] <%MelBrooksKA> I don't think I ever used the burner inverter outside of the tutorial
[2:55:38] <xeros720> that is a gun
[2:55:39] <Rionxgarland> the butthole surfers
[2:55:41] <%linSP> gun. gun. gun.
[2:55:41] <OwlLightningMage> GUN
[2:55:47] <%MidnightBurst12> Many guns are in your future
[2:55:56] <blue6sub6remnant6> Well, the gun% speedrun just got me.
[2:55:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> @s1rcuit My senator told me that coal will never run out tho
[2:55:58] <OwlLightningMage> GUN IS FUN GUN IS FUN
[2:55:59] <ToneBacas> why are there guns? monkaS
[2:56:02] <Bluecille> @SoFarFetched i remember the rosebud era
[2:56:04] <%AncelDeLambert> @Bluecille it's actually totally how you should start a new run. Loop about six burner miners into each other for convenient coal harvesting while you focus on building up iron and copper
[2:56:16] <OwlLightningMage> Good rule for life
[2:56:22] <aiutare47> Oh. Right now.
[2:56:29] <Grunkle_Dan_> Is this game better than Satisfactory?
[2:56:30] <ChungusQuest> damn, those critters can *move*
[2:56:34] <%MelBrooksKA> RULES OF NATURE!
[2:56:35] <$Dakuu75> "Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches, I slam in the back of my Dragula~!"

[2:56:39] <%Mendin> BACKWARDS AGAIN PAT
[2:56:52] <RyuuAoi> Need a flamethrower ngl
[2:57:08] <%ospreyworks> oh christ, the more I read about ever crisis, the worse it sounds
[2:57:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> We need a BACKWARDS emote for when Pat plays these factory games
[2:57:21] <%ospreyworks> 3/10 chapters are just Midgar
[2:57:21] <RyuuAoi> Idk if there is one but you need one....
[2:57:33] <%SirGO0SE> Pat's inevitable road to Rim World grows closer with the playing of Factorio
[2:57:35] <%ospreyworks> it's not going to be a faithful remake at all
[2:57:46] <%ospreyworks> it's gonna be abridged to shit
[2:58:07] <%espanishcanamurciana> heya pat
[2:58:16] <Rionxgarland> did paige ever finish baba is you
[2:58:31] <+D00msDayDan> @PatStaresAt when you're holding an item crtl+click to stick it in what you're mousing over, or z to add one at a time
[2:58:44] <s1rcuit> @Rionxgarland you already know the answer to your question
[2:58:49] <%espanishcanamurciana> espanishcanamurciana subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! mannnn, I just turned off the new Doom DLC and I am rusty.  I actually started Doom Eternal thanks to this channel.  Cheers Pat and Elmo
[2:58:50] <Ipsenscastle> burner inserter? I just met her!
[2:58:53] <Rionxgarland> heh
[2:59:26] <$Dakuu75> 7/10
[2:59:26] <dexdestroyazz> @SirGO0SE  D'you think he'll actually like Rimworld? as a player myself, it doesnt really have that satisfying build up to automation that this and satisfactory have.
[2:59:44] <Laioken13> he's learnding
[2:59:52] <AxelCezar> if factories is what pat is in now, he should just get a go at Minecraft Project Ozone
[2:59:56] <RyuuAoi> Pat, have you seen My Bloody Valentine from the '80s? You may "dig" it with your new found addiction to mining.
[3:00:09] <%AncelDeLambert> I can't stand Rimworld, nor Oxygen Included. They're completely different games to this. They're employee micromanaging simulators, and I hate them
[3:00:13] <+brosesarered> needs a chest
[3:00:16] <Tempmael> needs chest
[3:00:17] <ammobasket> box
[3:00:18] <%tebari> you need a box in the output
[3:00:20] <MartyFun11> Output is blocked
[3:00:20] <+Helljump3r6> blocked by its output
[3:00:20] <%bevyrage> conveyor belt to free up the space in front of it
[3:00:22] <%Daxalog> ! Waiting for space in destination
[3:00:23] <A0N33> The square it's dropping on to is already full
[3:00:23] <+LittleBigQuebec> it's dropping it on the floor pat
[3:00:25] <%AncelDeLambert> you don't build things, you put in work orders for things, and I despise it
[3:00:28] <tastehbread> it's spitting stuff out on the floor
[3:00:30] <+smjoao> put a chest or belt
[3:00:31] <%tebari> box or belt
[3:00:32] <+RyanTheRecluse> drill has no storage
[3:00:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah I don't think Rimworld will scratch the right itch for Pat
[3:00:33] <zargy> The ground is filled up
[3:00:34] <%Daxalog> It needs to go somewhere
[3:00:36] <%MelBrooksKA> say it with your CHEST Pat
[3:00:36] <%ChestMimik> You're gonna want those boxes
[3:00:39] <GunEden> nees a box or just pick it up
[3:00:42] <Psyramics> a box or a conveyor, or you catching it with your hands
[3:00:43] <Zero_Jacks> better to say, it needs a input
[3:00:44] <%MelBrooksKA> Yes
[3:00:49] <Slim_Lipid> need a toilet for that butt
[3:00:51] <ShichiNoBushi> Or conveyer belt.
[3:00:52] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt only like one thing can be on the floor in a square. More needs a container, like a box or belt
[3:00:54] <+Msytic6> Or conveyer
[3:00:59] <ammobasket> kill earth for more storage
[3:01:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> Learning "curve"
[3:01:20] <Laioken13> it has not even begun to curve
[3:01:23] <+brosesarered> if you hold control it'll automatically put fuel and stuff in
[3:01:25] <taquito_blade> how much is factorio? 🤔
[3:01:31] <RyuuAoi> Curves a little to the left even.
[3:01:32] <Tempmael> hot keys are your best friend
[3:01:37] <Siconia> Nothing like a good ol learning W A L L
[3:01:44] <%MelBrooksKA> 30 bucks I think?
[3:01:51] <dexdestroyazz> @ReallyBigRocks see thats what im thiking. Personally i like all 3, but knowing Pats particular taste differences, im not ssure its gonna appeal to him the way factorio and satis have
[3:01:59] <taquito_blade> that's pretty cheap
[3:02:08] <Laioken13> bork
[3:02:10] <$Dakuu75> Gief, you don't get extra-credit for Speaking, when no one asks you to.
[3:02:10] <+brosesarered> it automatically makes the things you need, like you don't need to make a furnace before making the drill
[3:02:20] <%Daxalog> Place em
[3:02:29] <+other_badger> yeah you can just queue up a shitzillion crafting jobs
[3:02:29] <zargy> but?
[3:02:31] <Psyramics> but what?
[3:02:35] <%walternatorz> the gief's rage cannot be contained
[3:02:44] <Psyramics> you need both
[3:02:45] <balthazar758> zangief makes a compelling argument tho
[3:02:46] <Tempmael> why not both?
[3:02:48] <%AncelDeLambert> you need furnaces to build drills
[3:02:49] <+spiceyweasle> I can’t play factorio because time disappears when I play it.
[3:02:50] <zargy> 🤔
[3:02:54] <%AncelDeLambert> and you WILL need furnaces
[3:02:55] <+Bail_Seven> right click
[3:02:58] <copyritetm> Hold right click
[3:03:13] <gitdweezzy> lastest version?
[3:03:25] <%Theycallmenerf> Hi
[3:03:32] <%walternatorz> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:03:35] <$Dakuu75> Elmo: Dude, I've interrupted their streams by screaming my ass off, SO MANY times.
[3:03:44] <$Dakuu75> Gief: Ok, looks like I got some catching up to do.
[3:04:21] <+other_badger> yeah the crafting will automatically do any itermediate items for you
[3:04:56] <+D00msDayDan> gonna have to start placing your own belts
[3:05:21] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Zangief seems really vocal lately, is Paige dangling food in front of him to taunt him?
[3:05:34] <@StridentSong> StridentSong subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 51 months, currently on a 51 month streak! 
[3:05:36] <%MelBrooksKA> What are ya, a fuckin' coppa?
[3:05:44] <%bevyrage> does he want a hug?
[3:05:45] <jorniev> gief is like: THIS IS WHERE MY LEEND BEGINS
[3:05:54] <%asgard147> "MORE! I WANT MORE MOM!" psaDogchamp
[3:05:55] <%walternatorz> He is aware his balls are in danger
[3:05:56] <balthazar758> lol that's the tired mom voice.

[3:06:01] <OwlLightningMage> Gief needs more power
[3:06:02] <Psyramics> just put belt down
[3:06:03] <Grunkle_Dan_> He's doing his best :D
[3:06:04] <+other_badger> MORE BELTS
[3:06:08] <jorniev> LEGEND OF GIEF
[3:06:09] <$Dakuu75> Gief: "Mom. mom, mom, mommy, mommy, momma, momma, mom, mom~"
[3:06:09] <%Daxalog> Belts
[3:06:10] <Psyramics> you have belts, use belts
[3:06:11] <+other_badger> BELTS FOR THE BELT GOD
[3:06:11] <Grunkle_Dan_> You scare those rodents away!
[3:06:17] <Tempmael> more belts
[3:06:20] <%tebari> You want to use betls and inserters to automate moving ore from miners to furnaces
[3:06:21] <ToneBacas> Gief had a big sleep, maybe he's just energetic now
[3:06:24] <OwlLightningMage> Gief needs to defeat his old brother, Elmo.
[3:06:30] <+LittleBigQuebec> you can also make belts
[3:06:32] <+TheBitingIrish> Gief doodStare
[3:06:36] <Psyramics> and you can make more belts too!
[3:06:40] <Torgue_1> Hey, is Gief on the ledge?
[3:06:40] <ToneBacas> Gief wants a play
[3:06:44] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> SSSsss
[3:06:44] <+TheBitingIrish> Belts? Nomura?
[3:06:56] <+other_badger> you do it
[3:07:03] <%BubbaRands> psaDogchamp Hold me down! I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinkin!!!!
[3:07:08] <%Daxalog> Well. No. Your cooking with coal

[3:07:14] <copyritetm> you can click and drag coveyor belts east peasy
[3:07:15] <%Daxalog> You dont have gas yet.
[3:07:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> Isn't Endwalked the 'fuck belts' expansion?
[3:07:41] <$Dakuu75> are there enemies and like... threats? in this game.
[3:07:41] <TofuNyan> Gief is such a cute doggo and so precious and i wish i could pet his snoot! ,3
[3:07:45] <TofuNyan> <3 *
[3:07:47] <Tempmael> time for industry
[3:07:48] <tastehbread> yes
[3:07:48] <Psyramics> yes you can!
[3:07:50] <+other_badger> blind
[3:07:51] <%bevyrage> PAT YOU WERE JUST ON THE BELTS
[3:07:53] <AmuserName> yes
[3:07:53] <%tebari> Yes you can make them
[3:07:53] <+other_badger> so blind
[3:07:53] <+smjoao> you can make belts
[3:07:54] <+LittleBigQuebec> yes you can
[3:07:55] <%Daxalog> You just moused over the blets
[3:07:56] <fuji_92> mas u can
[3:07:57] <Visorak6> Pat you were hovering right over it
[3:07:57] <Psyramics> you can make more belts!
[3:07:57] <+foomaster22> Yes you literally moused over them
[3:07:58] <+D00msDayDan> literally moused over belts in the menu lol
[3:08:01] <%bevyrage> psaBlind
[3:08:01] <KShirahama> yae sou can
[3:08:11] <%MelBrooksKA> Patuh
[3:08:16] <Tempmael> belts and arms
[3:08:23] <Siconia> He can do it
[3:08:24] <%tebari> Yup
[3:08:26] <%YakumoYomi> Insertion imminent
[3:08:27] <%Arsenic_8> inserter? i barely know her!
[3:08:30] <+Kinoskae> Pat, since the engagement, have you contracted the Blind from Paige?
[3:08:37] <doster504> he's doing the thing
[3:08:40] <Chester_goes_Berserk> final fantasy 7 part 2 will never get done without these belts
[3:08:41] <%Daxalog> Does satisfactory not use the inserter system?
[3:08:42] <%bevyrage> now pat
[3:08:43] <HeWhoMonologues> Cheer1000 Well, I seem to catch your stream more often now so that's sick. Also, I probably missed it but Terry hype after trailer y/n?
[3:08:48] <%YakumoYomi> @Arsenic_8 psaSmug
[3:08:49] <+brosesarered> pat, consider this for a moment... your belt has another side. what would happen if you put coal there
[3:08:50] <Tempmael> 2x production
[3:08:54] <%bevyrage> you can put an inserter on the box to then put coal into the furnace too
[3:08:57] <+foomaster22> Now pull the iron out of the furnace
[3:08:57] <%MelBrooksKA> Ctrl + Click on crafting queues up 5 items at a time
[3:09:01] <+D00msDayDan> @Daxalog satisfactory uses belts feeding straight into and out of structures
[3:09:15] <$Dakuu75> (I could NEVER find joy in playing a game liek this but, I still enjoy watching pat play it)
[3:09:22] <+other_badger> @bevyrage that's too much brain let him learn
[3:09:28] <HeWhoMonologues> When do attacks usually start chat?
[3:09:30] <+smjoao> if you want you can connect the coal belt into the iron belt to have both items in the same belt
[3:09:38] <skyentombment> Y'know what you need Pat? You need a large fan and a MUCH shittier mic and cam. And whenever Gief gets to barkin' like this, you could argue VERY loudly with Paige, have the fan going and be playing COD. That's what seems to work for streamers in my country.
[3:09:42] <Broand> gah I keep feelin' the need for backseat gaming, gotta rein it in
[3:09:43] <KShirahama> when we tell him about quick inserting and pickup?
[3:09:56] <%MelBrooksKA> @HeWhoMonologues He's in tutorial
[3:09:57] <+other_badger> @PatStaresAt you can right click on the crafting menu to queue up 5 at a time
[3:10:11] <+D00msDayDan> brain is firing up
[3:10:19] <%Broand> @skyentombment Don't forget the food he should be eating while arguing
[3:10:23] <$Dakuu75> stop saying "burner inserter" damn it, lol
[3:10:25] <HeWhoMonologues> @MelBrooksKA Thank you. I have only seen this game played and am unfamiliar.
[3:10:28] <Laioken13> neuron activation
[3:10:32] <ToneBacas> are you gonna neuter Zangief? I can't imagine how he's gonna behave when he's in heat
[3:10:41] <%bevyrage> no space
[3:10:43] <+other_badger> @Dakuu75 what why?
[3:10:47] <OwlLightningMage> This is a long tutorial LUL
[3:10:54] <%Broand> No
[3:10:58] <%Broand> it was too close to the belt
[3:10:58] <+D00msDayDan> this ain't dyson sphere program, inserters need their own spac
[3:11:02] <tastehbread> this is barely the start of the tutorials LUL
[3:11:02] <KShirahama> too colse
[3:11:03] <%bevyrage> pat you need SPACE
[3:11:05] <+Kinoskae> Good lord, I'm gonna stroke out
[3:11:07] <%tebari> No, you have to leave a space for the inserter
[3:11:07] <$Dakuu75> @other_badger idk, I'm jsut losing my shit hearing him say it, lol
[3:11:08] <+other_badger> side doesn't matter here
[3:11:09] <+ShinobiAJ> LUL
[3:11:11] <AmuserName> burner just needs a space.
[3:11:15] <Visorak6> too close pat
[3:11:15] <%Wurmspawn> No, you need a space for the inserter to sit.
[3:11:20] <%AncelDeLambert> there ya go
[3:11:21] <%MelBrooksKA> @OwlLightningMage This is only part 2 of like 5 I think
[3:11:30] <HeWhoMonologues> Sounds like a BDSM fire villain weapon. BURNER INSERTER!
[3:11:59] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt sadly you can only input from one space to one space until you get long inserters
[3:12:02] <%sweaty_weeb_> Ah I see that @PatStaresAt has discovered the digital crystal meth
[3:12:04] <%bevyrage> now pat, you can also just have belts leading to inserters that put coal straight into these
[3:12:15] <MustComplete> Do it Pat!!!
[3:12:15] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, you're splitting the belt, well done
[3:12:16] <Siconia> He's doing it
[3:12:20] <ammobasket> you're doing it!
[3:12:25] <sailercartridge> assuming chat wont let me post a link but pat you should google "kirk mcdonald factorio calculator"
[3:12:27] <%AncelDeLambert> he's doing it
[3:12:34] <%MelBrooksKA> @sweaty_weeb_ He discovered it like 2 weeks ago with Satisfactory
[3:12:35] <balthazar758> doing it
[3:12:56] <MustComplete> Never seen someone doing it SO HARD like this!
[3:13:01] <BrickleBork> polution scottfLurk
[3:13:01] <+D00msDayDan> now is the part where you scale up
[3:13:15] <+other_badger> ffs don't tell him to google shit yet he's still learning the mechanics
[3:13:21] <MustComplete> He's got it guys!
[3:13:29] <+brosesarered> if you hold ctrl and click a furnace, it'll collect the plates
[3:13:33] <%sweaty_weeb_> True @MelBrooksKA but I think we can both agree that the bug gynecide  makes this one so much better.
[3:13:46] <HeWhoMonologues> I am glad I do not know much about this game. Seems like its easy to backseat.
[3:13:52] <Parapattern> Monke neuron activated
[3:13:53] <%Broand> aaaah I didn't know thaaat
[3:13:55] <%MelBrooksKA> @sweaty_weeb_ I like both
[3:14:02] <%tebari> Now press Alt
[3:14:03] <+D00msDayDan> you can crtl+click to add fuel and such you have in your hand too
[3:14:18] <%sweaty_weeb_> same @MelBrooksKA
[3:14:22] <HeWhoMonologues> Speaking of protips.
[3:14:46] <%tebari> That's Alt Mode
[3:14:53] <MustComplete> Is the goal if this game to kill the planet?
[3:14:53] <copyritetm> Speaking of time savers, you don't need all of that belt and inserter set up, you can directly put the furnace in front of the mining drills to insert the ore directly into the furnace
[3:14:54] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> is this the ultimate terran drone sim?
[3:14:55] <+other_badger> the art style is so good
[3:14:57] <%Daxalog> 3d pre rendered
[3:15:02] <darkjiku> !uptime
[3:15:02] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 15m.
[3:15:04] <KaiserMario> WOLOLO
[3:15:14] <HeWhoMonologues> The view is mainly the reason I prefer Satisfactory. Just not huge on the isometric view.
[3:15:26] <+smjoao> tip: you can have two items on the same belt, like coal and iron ore on belts that go to furnaces
[3:15:37] <+A_Wild_Bandersnatch> oh
[3:15:40] <+other_badger> 2 kills on the board
[3:15:49] <+Msytic6> @patstaresat If you go into setting, you can change the colors of your guy.
[3:16:08] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> wouldn't it be isometric only if the grid rotated 45 degrees?
[3:16:12] <BlueLunecy> You can do it in the inventory
[3:16:13] <+D00msDayDan> it's from your inventory, top middle
[3:16:17] <%sweaty_weeb_> I have like 100 hours in this game and can honestly say I never bothered with the tutorial.
[3:16:17] <Pajex_> in the inventory screen i believe ?
[3:16:17] <copyritetm> I think its in your inventory menu
[3:16:29] <%MelBrooksKA> Not in settings, in inventory @PatStaresAt
[3:16:37] <%Jekado> WHAT IF IT WAS PURPLE!
[3:16:42] <pth88> purple? hes nilhaus now
[3:16:45] <RyuuAoi> You should be red guy
[3:16:45] <+TheWe4pon> i don't think i've ever seen anyone play anything besides sandbox.
[3:16:49] <+A_Wild_Bandersnatch> lol no preview
[3:16:53] <ShichiNoBushi> Purple is underrated.
[3:16:55] <+Msytic6> Yeah, inventory, my bad
[3:16:58] <%Arweynn> thats blue
[3:17:03] <HeWhoMonologues> I am probably using the term wrong. Mainly most games with the 3d prerendered and top down view.
[3:17:04] <%Emperor_Machinus> Blue
[3:17:06] <+other_badger> that's blue Kappa
[3:17:09] <@SoFarFetched> WHAT IF IT WAS PURPLE
[3:17:11] <%bassoontyphoon> psaUp
[3:17:17] <doster504> fuck off don't make him explode
[3:17:26] <%bassoontyphoon> Why is your guy blue?
[3:17:27] <+D00msDayDan> yeah every time i notice this game uses hardware cursor it's super jarring for like 5 minutes
[3:17:30] <%MelBrooksKA> @ShichiNoBushi It's the color of royalty tho...
[3:17:32] <%bevyrage> the number shows if you can make it
[3:17:36] <%AncelDeLambert> I think the ratio is still 3 steam generators to each boiler, but that may be wrong
[3:17:41] <@SoFarFetched> pat please control yourself
[3:17:42] <TheFramedWarlock> OH GOD WHY DID YOU MAKE ME NOTICE
[3:17:47] <TheFramedWarlock> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:17:49] <$RealThiele> hot erections
[3:17:49] <%Broand> It does but the speed of building compenants can vary
[3:17:51] <HeWhoMonologues> Wait is he blue or purple?
[3:17:53] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> this game is cool and all but in my highly professional opinion this could go from a 4.9 to a 5/5 game if the main characters shirt was just slightly more purple
[3:17:59] <Psyramics> its 2 engines to boilers
[3:18:02] <+other_badger> don't tell pat about r*tios yet please it'll kill him
[3:18:09] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, shove the generator right into the boiler side, there's no need to have it over there
[3:18:10] <Tempmael> time to lay pipe
[3:18:13] <Psyramics> but I wouldn't harp him on ratios right now
[3:18:20] <%AncelDeLambert> just put them down
[3:18:38] <HeWhoMonologues> Discovery is important people.
[3:18:43] <%sweaty_weeb_> It makes me want to die that it's not right next to it.
[3:18:59] <TheTakkster> Getting Darkwood vibes
[3:19:06] <%Daxalog> The blue bits
[3:19:07] <Psyramics> press Alt
[3:19:11] <+LittleBigQuebec> either ends
[3:19:11] <+topiodonk> is there anything on that box?
[3:19:16] <%sweaty_weeb_> Hit Alt again @PatStaresAt
[3:19:37] <+other_badger> he's doinguh it
[3:19:55] <%bassoontyphoon> hes beginning to believe
[3:19:56] <+TheWe4pon> CAn pat seen the icons when he hovers over the machines?
[3:20:05] <GunEden> pollute harder
[3:20:12] <%sweaty_weeb_> Q lets you select the item you've scrolled over from you inventory when you have them. @PatStaresAt
[3:20:25] <%tebari> Yup. Power poles create an AOE of electric power
[3:20:39] <AmuserName> You must construct additional pylons!
[3:20:44] <@Pandora_Prime> Ecosystem successfully destroyed
[3:20:56] <Siconia> He's starting to do it
[3:21:01] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> Self-feeding power supply!!
[3:21:11] <snivins> yeah pollution
[3:21:13] <%Emperor_Machinus> the Broiler
[3:21:13] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun
[3:21:14] <+topiodonk> probably should Power that claw?
[3:21:17] <%Taisuru> psaDogchamp
[3:21:21] <+other_badger> make a repair pack
[3:21:23] <%MisterTylerrr> But you love littering
[3:21:24] <KShirahama> repair kits i think
[3:21:25] <Siconia> Damn you creatures trying to protect your ecosystem!
[3:21:30] <+other_badger> not sure if that's in the tutorial?
[3:21:30] <Captain_Joe1911> BOP tansy5Tuntun like this, Pat
[3:21:31] <+D00msDayDan> can you craft repair packs in this tutorial?
[3:21:31] <$the6pixilkid> make a repair kit
[3:21:33] <+smjoao> you can craft a repair kit i think
[3:21:42] <Psyramics> you dont have that yet
[3:21:44] <%ChaosVulpes> Power pole on that claw with the BLINKING ICON maybe?
[3:21:45] <%bassoontyphoon> Everyday is Earth day for Pat in Factorio
[3:21:46] <Psyramics> you can't repair it yet
[3:21:47] <+D00msDayDan> no repair packs, good luck
[3:21:47] <snivins> you cant yet looks like
[3:21:48] <Pajex_> it's not there in tutorial i guess
[3:21:49] <%tebari> Tutorial doesn't give him repair kit
[3:21:51] <+other_badger> doesn't look there's repair
[3:21:54] <$Monkeyweed21> Your coal is going nowhere right now
[3:21:56] <%Daxalog> Just get ready to replace it i guess
[3:21:56] <GunEden> or just replace it
[3:21:59] <%sweaty_weeb_> Repair kits are probably not available yet
[3:22:01] <+topiodonk> no kits in tutorial NotLikeThis
[3:22:01] <%MelBrooksKA> Doesn't look like it's in the tutorial
[3:22:23] <snivins> press alt
[3:22:24] <+other_badger> he is growing stronger by the minute
[3:22:45] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> why does the conveyer not drop right into box
[3:22:51] <snivins> chat does tutorial tells him to presws alt?
[3:23:03] <Decarcassor> This part of the tutorial is kinda bad. Its really not clear what you are supposed to be doing and bug will keep coming.
[3:23:14] <%sweaty_weeb_> I'm dying inside lmao
[3:23:15] <%MelBrooksKA> @snivins We have
[3:23:17] <+other_badger> @NotSoAccurateNo1 conveyors just move stuff along the ground. only inserters (ad much later, drones) can directly access inventories
[3:23:18] <Psyramics> you can change those belts, they're not permanent
[3:23:33] <$tebari> You need to move the belt closer
[3:23:34] <+other_badger> not long enough
[3:23:39] <tastehbread> there are long inserters later, these don't reach that far
[3:23:39] <%Daxalog> You can make more poles
[3:23:46] <+other_badger> you can just make the belt take a detour up
[3:23:47] <+D00msDayDan> don't even need the chest tbh
[3:23:47] <%ssjklyco> Oh hey, Command and Conquer
[3:23:55] <pth88> you can move literally everything
[3:24:05] <%Daxalog> Make a bigger gun
[3:24:12] <HeWhoMonologues> Well then
[3:24:13] <pth88> the only good bugs a dead bug
[3:24:14] <+smjoao> you can now make gun but better
[3:24:24] <snivins> needs more spaguetti
[3:24:27] <%sweaty_weeb_> You can rotate the belts with R @PatStaresAt
[3:24:29] <+topiodonk> pat already better than i was, i put coal on the boiler manually for ages
[3:24:36] <SiegmundCG> don't make gun, just die for our amusement
[3:24:39] <GunEden> create another belt line or daisy chain insterters
[3:24:51] <Pajex_> do you need to put coal in the chest?
[3:24:58] <Psyramics> you can remove those belts
[3:25:03] <+other_badger> just make the belt go closer
[3:25:04] <ammobasket> move belt
[3:25:04] <%Daxalog> Your gonna need more bullets soon
[3:25:08] <KShirahama> moe the belt
[3:25:10] <+other_badger> you have belts to ove things
[3:25:10] <%Daxalog> Just bend the belts
[3:25:13] <KShirahama> move*
[3:25:14] <+other_badger> use the belts to move things
[3:25:16] <+PandaCavalry> move the belt closer. or loop
[3:25:19] <+smjoao> just move the belts one row up
[3:25:22] <Tempmael> you have 9
[3:25:24] <%sweaty_weeb_> USE THE R KEY

[3:25:26] <%tebari> R is your friend
[3:25:31] <snivins> yeah bend the belts
[3:25:33] <+other_badger> rebuild the converyor belt to take it where you want to go
[3:25:34] <%Taisuru> Bend it like beltem
[3:25:34] <Psyramics> you can manipulate those belts, they aren't fixed
[3:25:39] <HeWhoMonologues> Use belts on your pants
[3:25:40] <%sweaty_weeb_> BIG BRAIN
[3:25:43] <%sweaty_weeb_> ADD BELT
[3:25:44] <%Daxalog> Take em out. And just make it move closer
[3:25:50] <%tebari> You could also remove them and place them again
[3:25:55] <%Daxalog> You can move your belt freely!
[3:25:56] <snivins> move belt 1 up?
[3:25:56] <%sweaty_weeb_> He's so close
[3:25:57] <pth88> right click them pat
[3:25:58] <%Daxalog> body*
[3:25:59] <+D00msDayDan> you have 50 belts on you, you can do a lot with that
[3:26:03] <tastehbread> you can pick stuff up and put it back down without losing anything
[3:26:06] <+other_badger> @PatStaresAt the purpose of conveyor belts is to take items and move them to where you want them to be. Do that 4Head
[3:26:09] <%sweaty_weeb_> The Add belt
[3:26:10] <Psyramics> you can put more belts down
[3:26:11] <dfs_k> baba is you pat
[3:26:11] <%ChaosVulpes> The mind goblins are starting to activate.
[3:26:13] <ammobasket> same as Satisfactory. tear down and rebuild
[3:26:14] <KShirahama> build belt in front of inserter
[3:26:15] <%Daxalog> It brings it closer for an arm to put it in
[3:26:16] <+blacknightspawn> u turn
[3:26:24] <+topiodonk> put more belts my dude
[3:26:29] <Psyramics> put more belts down
[3:26:31] <pth88> dont let the chest break you
[3:26:33] <Pajex_> do you need to put coal in the chest?
[3:26:38] <snivins> move belt 1 up maybe
[3:26:39] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> speeedn
[3:26:41] <%sweaty_weeb_> You can just pick up the belts and then add them facing the inserter
[3:26:43] <+foomaster22> Just stop using the chest
[3:26:45] <+D00msDayDan> you don't even need that chest
[3:26:46] <AmuserName> you have more than one inserter
[3:26:48] <+FlappySeal_> When in doubt, more belts and inserters
[3:26:50] <+topiodonk> you have 9
[3:26:51] <%Monkeyweed21> make more inserters
[3:26:55] <KShirahama> yes
[3:26:57] <+TheWe4pon> you have 9 inserters
[3:27:04] <buerdo> Move box insert and belts
[3:27:04] <pth88> why do you need to store the coal
[3:27:05] <%Cn_alpha_02> U turn

[3:29:53] <%sweaty_weeb_> Into the boiler @PatStaresAt
[3:29:53] <HeWhoMonologues> Sits on the belt
[3:29:54] <%AncelDeLambert> into the boiler
[3:29:54] <AtelierZeno> INTO THE BOILER
[3:29:55] <buerdo> Get rid of box
[3:29:56] <+foomaster22> it sits on the belt
[3:29:56] <Pajex_> you don't need to buffer items
[3:29:57] <seth45er> THE BOILER!
[3:29:57] <KShirahama> into boiler
[3:30:04] <%Jekado> he wants a box for over flow is why
[3:30:05] <doster504> it will sit on the belt so your boiler always has fuel
[3:30:06] <%Monkeyweed21> STOP PUTTING COAL INTO THE BOX
[3:30:06] <pth88> The coal will build up and if the miner can't put it on the belt it will stop mining
[3:30:09] <snivins> it stays in the belt
[3:30:09] <%sweaty_weeb_> It doesn't need the box
[3:30:09] <+topiodonk> the inserter can feed the boiler
[3:30:09] <%metalicblackcherry> stays on the belt until needed
[3:30:10] <%solracc25> in the boiler
[3:30:13] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt here's something I think you need to hear: belts are storage
[3:30:18] <dfs_k> this man played satisfactory for 60 hours
[3:30:18] <%muetank> HOW
[3:30:20] <HeWhoMonologues> You got this
[3:30:21] <%MelBrooksKA> No bullets
[3:30:21] <%metalicblackcherry> we;[
[3:30:24] <ToneBacas> how do you clean off the corpses?
[3:30:24] <+D00msDayDan> wow i straight up didn't know this game had melee
[3:30:24] <%sweaty_weeb_> The box doesn't need to be there
[3:30:27] <cherrycottontail> Put the box AFTER the boiler if you want to worry about overfill
[3:30:29] <%tebari> Rotate the box inserter
[3:30:29] <%shruke> aliens please kill box
[3:30:30] <ammobasket> you don't need the box
[3:30:30] <%sweaty_weeb_> Get rid of the Box
[3:30:31] <KShirahama> you don't need box
[3:30:34] <tastehbread> he'll get it
[3:30:35] <%ChaosVulpes> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:30:37] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU DONT NEED THE BOX
[3:30:37] <%Daxalog> Focus on getting your bullets ready. This coal thing can wait
[3:30:39] <TofuNyan> You don't need the box. The other insert will take the coal off the box. The remaining coal will stay on the belt :D
[3:30:40] <Psyramics> it will backfill
[3:30:40] <%sweaty_weeb_> No box = mission complete
[3:30:40] <GunEden> just remove the box
[3:30:42] <seth45er> get rid of the inserter and the coal will stack up and go into the inserter!
[3:30:47] <snivins> coal stays in belt nothing is wasted
[3:30:47] <%Jekado> you will have to move the box
[3:30:49] <+foomaster22> It won't fall off the belt, it will stay on the belt until the inserter is ready to put it into the boiler
[3:30:50] <+Dtot360> Rotate the inserter 180
[3:30:51] <+BKNPham> NotLikeThis
[3:30:51] <%luftraumm1> I know ideally you'd want the coal secured in storage but from what I'm gathering it doesn't work like that
[3:30:53] <Psyramics> its just like satisfactory, when the belts are full, it'll stop
[3:30:55] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt you don't need the box, the miner will only mine enough to fill the belt
[3:30:55] <pth88> the boxes are tricking you
[3:30:56] <doster504> you can put box after boiler so boiler still gets coal\
[3:30:56] <%solracc25> the box is eatin your coal
[3:30:58] <%tebari> The other one
[3:31:03] <+other_badger> @PatStaresAt you could have the belt go past the boiler inserter and TYHEN go to the box
[3:31:03] <+Running_Sets> Running_Sets subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hope you're doing well dood!
[3:31:05] <%Jekado> box inbetween the two of the points
[3:31:08] <buerdo> Box is a trap
[3:31:12] <Pajex_> eventually the box will fillup chat Kappa
[3:31:16] <LoneFonte> no
[3:31:16] <%muetank> How can this BE
[3:31:17] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> This game provides enough goblin torture to me without the bugs. I always turn enemy AI off
[3:31:18] <%valcheese> psaWrong
[3:31:22] <HeWhoMonologues> Nah chat, he has got this
[3:31:23] <+brosesarered> pat..... you don't need the box
[3:31:23] <snivins> use a belt
[3:31:26] <+ariamis2187> move the box to end of line
[3:31:26] <%Arkfyre> NotLikeThis
[3:31:27] <+FlappySeal_> What you would ideally need is the box at the END of the track. So it only fills the box AFTER the pump is filled first
[3:31:28] <Visorak6> oh my god
[3:31:29] <%solracc25> kill box
[3:31:29] <%ChaosVulpes> How has he not figured out the problem IS the box?
[3:31:30] <%Daxalog> Its blocking it
[3:31:31] <%sweaty_weeb_> the pole is in the way
[3:31:34] <%ChaosVulpes> BABA IS YOU!!!
[3:31:34] <%Jaxnos> this is impressive in its own way
[3:31:36] <%sweaty_weeb_> MY BRAIN HURTS LOL
[3:31:38] <+other_badger> there's a pole in the way
[3:31:38] <seth45er> GET RID OF THE INSERTER TO THE BOX!
[3:31:40] <%Jekado> i don't think they pull ot do they?
[3:31:45] <Visorak6> Kill the box pat just trust us
[3:31:46] <KShirahama> It seems pat is too tired for factorio right now
[3:31:48] <geminibread> he has a degree btw
[3:31:50] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt Pat, if you want to fill the box for personal use with excess coal, put it AFTER the boiler
[3:31:51] <AtelierZeno> pat you don't need the box
[3:31:54] <HeWhoMonologues> Another belt of course
[3:31:55] <+A_Wild_Bandersnatch> THATS WHAT SHE SAID
[3:31:56] <+other_badger> @Jekado they do
[3:31:56] <%sweaty_weeb_> Delete Box @PatStaresAt
[3:31:57] <Zeif00> But Baba
[3:31:57] <sendart> box bad
[3:31:58] <+topiodonk> the inserter can feed the boiler directly from the belts you dont need the box NotLikeThis
[3:31:59] <Siconia> He can't
[3:32:00] <%Daxalog> Just move the box to a more comfortable position
[3:32:00] <seth45er> ANOTHER INSERTER TO THE BOILER!
[3:32:01] <%solracc25> kill box
[3:32:04] <snivins> delete box inserter
[3:32:04] <%metalicblackcherry> PAAAAAAT
[3:32:05] <+StrudleBum> you could move the box forward a little so that you're both inserting and taking from the box
[3:32:05] <AtelierZeno> you don't need the boooooox
[3:32:07] <%tebari> Inserter from box into belt. Inserter from belt into boiler
[3:32:07] <doster504> Move box so it gets coal after the boiler
[3:32:09] <$SGrim> You heard it here first. folks. Pat forgot how to get it up.
[3:32:10] <AtelierZeno> what's in the boooooooox
[3:32:13] <%Daxalog> KILL THE BOX. The box is evil!
[3:32:14] <%AncelDeLambert> psaGoblin sipsipHonk
[3:32:15] <%valcheese> psaHoldon psaWrong
[3:32:17] <+foomaster22> NO BOX, DON'T NEED IT
[3:32:19] <Pajex_> why box 🤔
[3:32:19] <ballisticwafflez> A NEW INSERTER TOUCHES THE BOILER
[3:32:20] <ShmowzowKapow> belts are good and cool
[3:32:21] <%ChaosVulpes> The box doesn't even need to exist!!!
[3:32:21] <+brosesarered> but baba can't be me
[3:32:23] <%sweaty_weeb_> You can move the box to another location at the end of the belts
[3:32:25] <AtelierZeno> GET RID OF THE BOX
[3:32:26] <+D00msDayDan> YOU DO NOT NEED BOX AAAAAAA
[3:32:28] <darkjiku> pat this isnt a fixed puzzle you ca literally delete everything
[3:32:28] <Tempmael> snake belt up one to boiler
[3:32:29] <+brosesarered> BUT BABA CEASES TO EXIST
[3:32:31] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt belts are storage!!
[3:32:31] <+Kinoskae> you don't need the box if the coal is going straight into the boiler!
[3:32:32] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PatStaresAt i'd restart this tutorial map since you lost too much shit to the bugs
[3:32:33] <%metalicblackcherry> the goblins live in the box
[3:32:34] <seth45er> YOU DON'T NEED THE COAL BOX AND JUST INSERT IN TO THE BOILER!
[3:32:34] <Visorak6> KILL THE BOX
[3:32:36] <%solracc25> Dont need box box after
[3:32:40] <%tebari> Box is BABA
[3:32:43] <+TheWe4pon> Why does pat nee the box?
[3:32:44] <sendart> Baba is pat
[3:32:47] <%sweaty_weeb_> The box is stopping the coal from reaching the boiler because it is before it in squence
[3:32:48] <%ChaosVulpes> BABA can't be me!!!
[3:32:51] <TofuNyan> You don't need the box. You never idd.
[3:32:51] <snivins> box inserter is bad
[3:32:51] <+FlappySeal_> Always mentally prioritise. If you want the coal somewhere specific, why is it not getting there? In this case, it's because it's going to the box first. So get rid of the methods sending it to the box
[3:32:52] <+StrudleBum> The Belt is the buffer
[3:32:53] <%metalicblackcherry> this is a bit at this point yes?
[3:32:54] <TofuNyan> D:
[3:32:54] <%TheWinged7> oh did i join just in time for the goblins?
[3:32:54] <+topiodonk> kill box
[3:32:55] <AtelierZeno> no you don't need to store it!
[3:32:56] <+foomaster22> You don't need to store it
[3:32:56] <Psyramics> why do you need to store coal?
[3:32:57] <%solracc25> remove box
[3:32:57] <%Daxalog> Put the box somewhere else
[3:32:57] <Pajex_> belt is storage
[3:32:58] <pth88> you dont need to store coal
[3:32:58] <%Arkfyre> remove box, insert coal directly into the boiler
[3:32:58] <+ariamis2187> move the box to the end of the line
[3:32:59] <%AncelDeLambert> BELTS! ARE! STORAGE!
[3:33:00] <+D00msDayDan> you can curve the belt before it reaches the box so coal goes to the boiler first
[3:33:01] <AmuserName> COAL BOX CEASES TO BE
[3:33:01] <buerdo> 📦
[3:33:02] <KShirahama> then where you will use it?
[3:33:04] <%MidnightBurst12> Coal is stored on belt
[3:33:05] <%solracc25> put it after
[3:33:05] <+StrudleBum> Believe in the belt
[3:33:06] <%sweaty_weeb_> just move the box to the end of the belt after the coal is being fed to the boiler
[3:33:06] <AtelierZeno> you don't need to store the coal
[3:33:10] <Oqzar> move the box after the boiler inserter so you store the extra
[3:33:12] <%ChaosVulpes> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:33:15] <Buka_Zero> satisfactory skills are fucking you
[3:33:15] <buerdo> Think out side of the. Ox
[3:33:16] <snivins> do it in the future
[3:33:20] <Slim_Lipid> coal keep? coal keep
[3:33:21] <sendart> coal is stores on belt
[3:33:21] <+LittleBigQuebec> 1 problem at a time pat
[3:33:21] <$spardanwarrior> Coal can just stay on the belt
[3:33:22] <+other_badger> @PatStaresAt have the belt go past the boiler first. THEN, store any excess that makes it past the boiler in the box
[3:33:23] <seth45er> you can build another miner and for another box for coal
[3:33:24] <AtelierZeno> :o
[3:33:25] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt production can always ramp up, you'll make more later
[3:33:25] <Pajex_> PogChamp
[3:33:25] <+FlappySeal_> Doesn't matter if it just sits on the belts
[3:33:28] <snivins> rremove inserter
[3:33:29] <doster504> pat put the box where the boiler gets coal first then the box
[3:33:29] <+TheWe4pon> @PatStaresAt shorten the belt and move box to in front of boiler.
[3:33:30] <Decarcassor> You will run this part on electricity, you only need coal for the boiler and nothing else.
[3:33:32] <pth88> Delete the box and free your mind pat
[3:33:33] <AtelierZeno> waynerOo
[3:33:34] <darkjiku> BOX HAS BEEN DEFEATED
[3:33:34] <+Dtot360> Everything else probably uses electricity
[3:33:35] <LoneFonte> then LATER you boost the coal ratio
[3:33:38] <TheFramedWarlock> Storage ? What is this, Minecraft ? LUL
[3:33:38] <%solracc25> belt up
[3:33:39] <+topiodonk> THE EVIL IS DEFEATED
[3:33:40] <AmuserName> YES
[3:33:40] <Tempmael> yay we do it
[3:33:45] <Zeif00> PogChamp PogChamp
[3:33:45] <Siconia> Pat unga bunga
[3:33:46] <+FlappySeal_> Only things that need to go in storage really are finished products like inserters etc so you can use them in the future
[3:33:48] <TheFramedWarlock> YES
[3:33:48] <%sweaty_weeb_> You have belts just build the inserter and then connect it to a belt
[3:33:50] <AmuserName> YEEEEES
[3:33:50] <%metalicblackcherry> just have a dedicated line of coal for the boiler
[3:33:54] <TheFramedWarlock> Be gone, box
[3:33:55] <%AncelDeLambert> off by one
[3:33:55] <%muetank> Just put the box at the END of the line so it stores the overflow
[3:33:57] <seth45er> YAAA!!!
[3:33:58] <AmuserName> ALMOST
[3:34:00] <%metalicblackcherry> YES
[3:34:00] <seth45er> YESS!
[3:34:00] <%sweaty_weeb_> RIP
[3:34:01] <%ChaosVulpes> He almost has it...
[3:34:04] <LoneFonte> one more up
[3:34:04] <+StrudleBum> rip
[3:34:04] <AtelierZeno> rip
[3:34:06] <+topiodonk> YEA BOI YOU DID IT
[3:34:08] <%AncelDeLambert> most new players don't have this problem
[3:34:08] <Siconia> F
[3:34:09] <Pajex_> restart is good
[3:34:09] <+other_badger> MORTIS
[3:34:09] <snivins> hahah
[3:34:12] <+BKNPham> Notlikethis
[3:34:13] <HeWhoMonologues> Good thing you figured it out right @PatStaresAt
[3:34:14] <Zero_Jacks> lytWAH
[3:34:15] <+foomaster22> Turn off enemies
[3:34:15] <tastehbread> you'll get it, man
[3:34:16] <sendart> defeated by box
[3:34:16] <%Jaxnos> now you can make a fresh start
[3:34:16] <aPictureInMotion> grats
[3:34:17] <%sweaty_weeb_> He was so close FeelsBadMan
[3:34:17] <dfs_k> nooooooooooo
[3:34:18] <ahmz1404> When you start a new sandbox game, I recommend turning off the biters
[3:34:18] <s1rcuit> those bugs are aggressive
[3:34:18] <+Kinoskae> 17 minute tutorial level
[3:34:19] <+StrudleBum> one step at a time
[3:34:20] <%AncelDeLambert> his brain broke
[3:34:20] <+BKNPham> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:34:21] <+FlappySeal_> Oh dear
[3:34:22] <%ChaosVulpes> Oh dear, they killed him before he could place the belt to send coal into the boiler and not a box
[3:34:22] <Zeif00> You were close
[3:34:23] <TheFramedWarlock> NotLikeThis
[3:34:23] <dfs_k> he didn't do it chat
[3:34:24] <AmuserName> LUL
[3:34:25] <darkjiku> "YOU HAVE KILLED BOX, NOW DIE"
[3:34:25] <%AncelDeLambert> killed by box
[3:34:26] <%metalicblackcherry> lesson learned goblins defeated this was a win
[3:34:29] <dfs_k> he missed one square
[3:34:30] <ammobasket> you were doing it
[3:34:31] <+Arsimckhoi> did he win?
[3:34:31] <%MelBrooksKA> @foomaster22 Can't tutorial
[3:34:34] <Decarcassor> To be fair, that part of the tutorial is really bad at explaining things.
[3:34:36] <SiegmundCG> yesssssss
[3:34:37] <dfs_k> sooo close
[3:34:41] <+topiodonk> you did at least SeemsGood
[3:34:43] <%sweaty_weeb_> Bruh my brain is literally dying
[3:34:48] <+StrudleBum> Belts are the storage, treat them like a buffer zone
[3:34:48] <Tempmael> you got it, just needed more gun
[3:34:51] <DianaTheAscian> ?
[3:34:53] <buerdo> Factorio is too hard
[3:34:57] <+foomaster22> Why tf do they have enemies at the beginning of the tutorial?????
[3:35:02] <%ChaosVulpes> But BABA is ME!!!
[3:35:07] <$jacob2pop> Jesus where did Pat's base spawn?
[3:35:09] <TheFramedWarlock> There is no storage pat, only belt
[3:35:11] <snivins> embrace the spaguetti @PatStaresAt
[3:35:16] <Hellarussian> Factorio make my brain hurtorio
[3:35:18] <+FlappySeal_> @foomaster22 Ain't a tutorial though, it's just the game
[3:35:21] <%sweaty_weeb_> FeelsBadMan
[3:35:22] <HeWhoMonologues> Keeping you on your toes!
[3:35:23] <SiegmundCG> this specific tutorial just kinda sucks
[3:35:26] <LoneFonte> @jacob2pop it's the tutorial scenario
[3:35:26] <dfs_k> i love you chat
[3:35:27] <%AncelDeLambert> it really isn't
[3:35:28] <TheFramedWarlock> You never need to store ANYTHING except things you can directly use by placing them down
[3:35:28] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's impossible!
[3:35:34] <HeWhoMonologues> well nothing wants to kill you outright in that game.
[3:35:36] <GunEden> your overthinking
[3:35:44] <+smjoao> you can do it pat!
[3:35:44] <%sweaty_weeb_> It's not hard but jesus christ
[3:35:50] <ammobasket> storage buffers are useful, but this one can go direct for now
[3:35:52] <+FlappySeal_> tbh I enjoyed Factorio most when I played in peaceful with no enemies. Freedom to just learn and explore
[3:35:52] <+topiodonk> yea, i dont like the bugs, i Just like making big factory big pollution
[3:35:54] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt belts ARE storage, my man. I will bang this drum to eternity
[3:35:55] <+other_badger> wtf storage is useful
[3:35:57] <+other_badger> sometimes
[3:36:00] <%tebari> You don't need to have buffer boxed like you did in Satisfactory. Just route the belt near the boiler so the inserter can grab it.
[3:36:06] <+smjoao> wrong pipe
[3:36:08] <HeWhoMonologues> So basically storage is unimportant
[3:36:11] <Pajex_> LUL
[3:36:13] <+LittleBigQuebec> restart
[3:36:14] <+D00msDayDan> oh no he blew all his iron on a pipe to ground
[3:36:15] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no
[3:36:16] <%ChestMimik> You won't need nearly the same kind of storage as Satisfactory demands
[3:36:17] <%solracc25> belt up
[3:36:21] <seth45er> you need something just take it from a production line
[3:36:21] <TofuNyan> Pat. The coal will stay on the belt. It won't fall off. Once the belt is full of coal, it will remain there. You don't need a box.
[3:36:22] <snivins> hahah
[3:36:22] <+other_badger> RESET
[3:36:24] <%sweaty_weeb_> He already messed up psaBougie
[3:36:25] <LoneFonte> wait, it workedw
[3:36:33] <pth88> the tutorial could be a lot better
[3:36:36] <+walternatorz> brain must mush before it must wrinkle
[3:36:39] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt it's an underground pipe, it can stretch real far. So it's expensive
[3:36:41] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PatStaresAt because you can use it to skip undergound
[3:36:41] <LoneFonte> it means you can make 20 pipes
[3:36:42] <+StrudleBum> they go underground and can be placed further apart
[3:36:43] <ammobasket> it's for distance and spaghetti
[3:36:46] <dfs_k> you'd want storage to pile up production while the the next chain is stalling
[3:36:47] <+D00msDayDan> pipe to ground is an underground pipe that runs for up to 10 blocks
[3:36:55] <doster504> you can move the boiler one to the left so you don't need that pipe
[3:37:17] <TheFramedWarlock> Things stay on the belts, if you need any base materials just take them directly from the belt.
[3:37:21] <HeWhoMonologues> Suddenly mobs attack!
[3:37:46] <tastehbread> there's space above the box for both an inserter and conveyer belt if you want to go that route
[3:37:47] <DianaTheAscian> what is Paige doing?
[3:37:57] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> make a big mess
[3:38:03] <+StrudleBum> relax
[3:38:07] <%tebari> One more belt
[3:38:09] <LoneFonte> one more
[3:38:13] <AmuserName> ONE MORE
[3:38:13] <%sweaty_weeb_> Needs to be closer
[3:38:14] <+foomaster22> Too far away one more belt
[3:38:17] <+other_badger> one tile too short
[3:38:17] <+brosesarered> a little closer
[3:38:18] <%Dunmarkh> oh shit pat started factorio tonight
[3:38:31] <HeWhoMonologues> @PatStaresAt Another reason the other seems preferable. Much stress in trying to optimize.
[3:38:34] <%solracc25> one more
[3:38:43] <pth88> is the kitchen mic'd up too lol
[3:38:47] <+other_badger> KomodoHype
[3:38:49] <%sweaty_weeb_> It's full @PatStaresAt
[3:38:49] <snivins> good
[3:38:51] <LoneFonte> yes
[3:38:54] <ChungusQuest> @Dunmarkh just the tutorial, to be fair to those who live by the schedule
[3:38:55] <+brosesarered> it'll work
[3:38:55] <ammobasket> good!
[3:38:56] <+LittleBigQuebec> yes we're good
[3:38:56] <%tebari> Good
[3:38:56] <+foomaster22> Good it is working it just has more than enough coal
[3:38:57] <+topiodonk> yep that it
[3:38:57] <+smjoao> there you go
[3:38:58] <+other_badger> trust me it's working
[3:38:58] <%sweaty_weeb_> That's why it's not feeding
[3:38:59] <snivins> take coal out to see if it works
[3:38:59] <+D00msDayDan> inserter isn't inserting because the boiler has enough fuel
[3:39:00] <+PandaCavalry> it is full
[3:39:01] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt boiler is full
[3:39:02] <Psyramics> it'll start once the coal in the boiler runs low
[3:39:02] <+brosesarered> it's just full on coal right now
[3:39:04] <doster504> It won't insert if boiler has enough fuel in it
[3:39:04] <+smjoao> you did it pat
[3:39:04] <+LittleBigQuebec> PAT WE'RE FINE
[3:39:04] <GunEden> your good
[3:39:05] <Tempmael> powerpole?
[3:39:06] <%AncelDeLambert> boiler is full
[3:39:07] <%tebari> The inserter will pick up coal when the boiler needs it.
[3:39:07] <LVL1_Scumbag> Doesn't need to
[3:39:09] <balthazar758> doing it? doing it. doing it?
[3:39:09] <+other_badger> @PatStaresAt it keeps just enough coal in
[3:39:14] <%metalicblackcherry> as it needs to
[3:39:15] <%sweaty_weeb_> Because it's not feeding @PatStaresAt
[3:39:15] <LoneFonte> @PatStaresAt it will fill when it gets below 5
[3:39:16] <ammobasket> it's working, only inserts when the boiler needs it
[3:39:16] <Psyramics> take it all out and see what happens
[3:39:17] <+PandaCavalry> it only goes to 5? unless you add moire manually
[3:39:17] <einSynd> There's a status light on the inserter
[3:39:19] <LVL1_Scumbag> Because it already has coal
[3:39:23] <+D00msDayDan> the inserter says not enough space in destination
[3:39:24] <+other_badger> it's fine
[3:39:25] <%AncelDeLambert> energy demands are too low
[3:39:26] <+PandaCavalry> because there is no energy draw
[3:39:26] <ballisticwafflez> More engines for the engine god
[3:39:28] <doster504> it has nothing to really power so it do that
[3:39:28] <skyentombment> MORE QA LIVE
[3:39:28] <GunEden> your not consuming electricty
[3:39:28] <buerdo> Insert grabs from side of belt
[3:39:30] <HeWhoMonologues> Because it is filling up and using over and over @PatStaresAt
[3:39:32] <+topiodonk> It makes a loat of steam
[3:39:36] <+other_badger> you're making excess steam, that's a good thing
[3:39:37] <%sweaty_weeb_> Now add another crate and inserter to the side of the belt @PatStaresAt
[3:39:41] <+brosesarered> don't worry about it going crazy it's just not using much energy right now
[3:39:42] <kamesenpai> maxed your output fool
[3:39:43] <ammobasket> it's pumping into the generator, no prob
[3:39:43] <snivins> belt is full
[3:39:46] <HeWhoMonologues> Well they wrecked your water.
[3:39:48] <$Hommando> You're only powering one thing
[3:39:50] <%bevyrage> you need to attach more things to it to prevent it from getting full
[3:39:51] <$valkuma> @PatStaresAt The steam engine is drawing a very small amount of steam so the boiler is going on and off for a small amount of time
[3:39:52] <ShmowzowKapow> coal is backed up so nothing is on
[3:39:52] <%Daxalog> It only generates to feed energy thats needed
[3:39:53] <Psyramics> miner is backed up, so its not doing anything, and thats the only draw on the system
[3:39:54] <+StrudleBum> check the generator
[3:39:54] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt you're running one miner, that's full, and one inserter
[3:39:56] <+other_badger> there is energy draw, just very little. it's fine
[3:39:56] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PatStaresAt at this current moment none of your machines are working
[3:39:57] <buerdo> Belts have two sides inserter grabs from beside only
[3:39:58] <$Hommando> two things
[3:40:00] <+PandaCavalry> the drill doesn't need to make any more because its full. the inserter doesn't need to move because its full
[3:40:02] <$jacob2pop> Pat I can fucking see the goblins coming out of your ears
[3:40:03] <%MelBrooksKA> Nothing needs that much power
[3:40:04] <+D00msDayDan> the boiler isn't outputting steam at a consistent rate because steam isn't being used up very fast
[3:40:08] <LVL1_Scumbag> but babaaa
[3:40:08] <%Daxalog> So its rapidly burning a single coal down as it feeds stuff
[3:40:10] <%AncelDeLambert> belt full
[3:40:11] <HeWhoMonologues> Looks broken
[3:40:11] <KShirahama> belt is full
[3:40:11] <GunEden> belt full
[3:40:11] <%sweaty_weeb_> Because the belt is at max capacity
[3:40:12] <+StrudleBum> the belt is full
[3:40:12] <+other_badger> ONE GUY
[3:40:13] <%TheLeadingTone> Belt is full
[3:40:13] <+StrongNico> track full
[3:40:14] <doster504> because the belt is full
[3:40:14] <snivins> belt is full @PatStaresAt
[3:40:14] <$valkuma> Conveyor full
[3:40:14] <$Hommando> Coal backup
[3:40:15] <Hellarussian> its full
[3:40:16] <%Arkfyre> belt is full
[3:40:16] <einSynd> Waiting for space in destination
[3:40:17] <%solracc25> power the thing
[3:40:17] <+other_badger> your machines are working
[3:40:17] <+smjoao> the minning machine and the inserter stopped so theres is no energ being used
[3:40:17] <+LittleBigQuebec> because the belt is full
[3:40:17] <%AncelDeLambert> this is huge baba
[3:40:18] <dfs_k> you have too much coal so the miner is stalled which means it's not draining power which means the boiler doesn't need to be on
[3:40:20] <Zero_Jacks> Drill not working bec the belt is full
[3:40:21] <buerdo> Curve end of conveyor
[3:40:21] <GunEden> now you put down the storage
[3:40:26] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt to much juice?
[3:40:26] <+StrudleBum> no worry, the belt is the buffer
[3:40:27] <%AncelDeLambert> time to build radars
[3:40:27] <LoneFonte> because you're not using for ANYTHING
[3:40:32] <DennisStreaming> the belt has two sides, you need to have the full side facing the boiler. so loop the belt around @PatStaresAt
[3:40:33] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PatStaresAt NOW you can make the box
[3:40:33] <%sweaty_weeb_> So add an inserter and crate to the side of the belt @PatStaresAt
[3:40:34] <+TheWe4pon> @PatStaresAt  take coal out of boiler
[3:40:35] <+smjoao> walk over the belt while holding f
[3:40:38] <%tebari> Go add miners for iron
[3:40:39] <+foomaster22> DO OBJECTIVE
[3:40:40] <+StrudleBum> you did good, this is good, don't worry
[3:40:41] <Visorak6> Is there a way to make a splitter yet?
[3:40:42] <%AncelDeLambert> you allowed that one box to RUIN you, man
[3:40:42] <KShirahama> now start gathering other resources
[3:40:42] <%Monkeyweed21> it doesnt need to work right now
[3:40:42] <%bevyrage> runoff arms that place stuff in boxes
[3:40:47] <dfs_k> factorio is going to kill this man
[3:40:47] <+FlappySeal_> Time to build more!
[3:40:49] <+topiodonk> once you expand this wont be a problem
[3:40:49] <%metalicblackcherry> energy is done next thing
[3:40:49] <%AncelDeLambert> this is done
[3:40:52] <%Valdorick> You need to spend power for the power to be needed.
[3:40:55] <%AncelDeLambert> go to iron
[3:40:58] <TheFramedWarlock> The drill isn't working because the coal belt is full. If machines aren't producing or currently in action, then they draw no power
[3:40:59] <KShirahama> mine other resources
[3:41:02] <+D00msDayDan> @PatStaresAt inserter is not inserting because boiler has enough fuel to run
[3:41:02] <$Hommando> Your power production outpaces your power usage so you have a coal backup on your belt, build more stuff.
[3:41:11] <LoneFonte> last one
[3:41:15] <%Daxalog> I never people can get so overwhelmed with stuff like this.
[3:41:21] <%Daxalog> i never knew*
[3:41:28] <buerdo> It is not done it is jammed
[3:41:33] <%tebari> You need a bunch of iron and copper plates
[3:41:35] <+foomaster22> You just need a bunch of copper and iron
[3:41:37] <HeWhoMonologues> Perhaps a big gun before the swarm comes in again?
[3:41:38] <snivins> you need iron plates
[3:41:42] <Simez291> it will took aeons to get him understanding this game :D have fun all
[3:41:43] <LoneFonte> it's not jammed
[3:41:45] <s1rcuit> Pat is not having fun
[3:41:50] <+StrudleBum> one step at a time :)
[3:41:56] <%MelBrooksKA> sipsipGears
[3:42:02] <%YakumoYomi> Eye Run
[3:42:03] <%sweaty_weeb_> Yes
[3:42:09] <%Daxalog> Do you have spare bullets? If not you should make some.
[3:42:09] <Psyramics> the Q tool is magic
[3:42:10] <+foomaster22> Because its an ore
[3:42:11] <+Tman451> Tman451 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! 
[3:42:11] <+smjoao> in the recipe it also tells you the raw items you need like iron and copper plates
[3:42:12] <snivins> technology LUL
[3:42:14] <GunEden> quick build
[3:42:15] <LoneFonte> context sensitive, i think
[3:42:16] <Tempmael> cuz hotkeys
[3:42:18] <%sweaty_weeb_> Q will pick the item your hovering over from you inventory
[3:42:20] <RyuuAoi> This tew much!
[3:42:24] <%Monkeyweed21> Q is for Quality of Life
[3:42:25] <+D00msDayDan> Q also selects whatever structure your mouse is hovering over
[3:42:26] <Psyramics> one objective at a time
[3:42:36] <s1rcuit> well that's just good life advice
[3:42:44] <reasonance> R to rotate
[3:42:47] <%espanishcanamurciana> what monsters just did pat just fight?
[3:42:53] <HeWhoMonologues> Iron seems the next step regardless
[3:42:59] <+StrudleBum> I'd say focus on iron so you don't overwhelm yourself for now
[3:42:59] <LVL1_Scumbag> Basically zerg
[3:43:00] <reasonance> @espanishcanamurciana zerglings
[3:43:00] <dfs_k> locals
[3:43:00] <0range_> wow they really throw a lot of bugs in the tutorial huh
[3:43:01] <slix3431> @PatStaresAt While you were gathering copper and iron. I was having sex with girls
[3:43:07] <snivins> he is learning rbzP
[3:43:07] <KShirahama> toofar from you
[3:43:08] <ammobasket> @espanishcanamurciana they're called biters
[3:43:09] <%bevyrage> white means it has something in its range
[3:43:09] <%sweaty_weeb_> To far away
[3:43:11] <LoneFonte> not close enough
[3:43:11] <+LittleBigQuebec> too far away to place
[3:43:12] <Psyramics> tiny baby hands
[3:43:13] <$Hommando> Move closer
[3:43:14] <Tempmael> walk closer
[3:43:14] <snivins> your person is too far
[3:43:14] <Psyramics> run closer
[3:43:14] <+foomaster22> You are standing too far away
[3:43:15] <$Hommando> walk
[3:43:19] <LoneFonte> walk
[3:43:19] <+smjoao> you haveto get closer
[3:43:20] <+D00msDayDan> you're standing too far away
[3:43:20] <+other_badger> your arms are too puny
[3:43:21] <+StrudleBum> human hands
[3:43:27] <%espanishcanamurciana> they looked like zerglings, where is this supposed to be
[3:43:33] <$jacob2pop> @espanishcanamurciana bugs, as you build more and pollution starts growing the attack you machines
[3:43:33] <Simez291> LUL
[3:43:37] <Badd001> SPACE
[3:43:38] <LoneFonte> now box/furnace
[3:43:40] <+foomaster22> Now we need the furnaces again
[3:43:50] <+Onionchamp> You can also click and drag to place poles at their maximum distance
[3:43:52] <+moondog_> I'm sick of these littlesiha ads....holy shit
[3:43:53] <%espanishcanamurciana> fucking yikes, no thanks
[3:44:02] <HeWhoMonologues> As soon as this drill is done they will swarm again,
[3:44:13] <snivins> side doesnt matter
[3:44:16] <+StrudleBum> coal and power
[3:44:16] <LoneFonte> both sides work
[3:44:16] <+other_badger> it doesn't have to be on that side
[3:44:19] <%sweaty_weeb_> It doesn't matter what side of the belt its on
[3:44:20] <KShirahama> any side
[3:44:24] <+other_badger> inserters can reach both sides
[3:44:29] <+D00msDayDan> @PatStaresAt insterters can pull from either side of the belt
[3:44:35] <pth88> walk over a belt and press F pat
[3:44:36] <Psyramics> you can press F to grab items off belts
[3:44:37] <+LittleBigQuebec> now make the box for excess coal @PatStaresAt
[3:44:39] <%Jekado> why not get the coal from the belt
[3:44:41] <HeWhoMonologues> You can grab from belt no?
[3:44:42] <+StrudleBum> you could turn your coal belt into a loop Kappa
[3:44:42] <%metalicblackcherry> hold f in front of the coal miner
[3:44:42] <%Jekado> the one that is full
[3:44:45] <snivins> like satisfactory if you are doing it by hand you are doing it wrong
[3:44:47] <AmuserName> CAN just walk over your coal-belt
[3:44:50] <+FlappySeal_> This is where you want your coal belt to loop over there to feed the smelter too
[3:44:53] <Tempmael> grab from belt with f key
[3:44:59] <snivins> press alt @PatStaresAt
[3:45:00] <+ariamis2187> hold f and run over coal belt
[3:45:03] <Simez291> @sweaty_weeb_ thats not true :D
[3:45:04] <LVL1_Scumbag> Baby steps
[3:45:04] <+StrudleBum> you also want to output your furnace
[3:45:12] <HeWhoMonologues> Path of most resistance. Classic Pat.
[3:45:13] <%MelBrooksKA> @PatStaresAt Press F while running on belt to grab stuff
[3:45:14] <KShirahama> just build second coal miner
[3:45:23] <Zero_Jacks> iron -> merging <- coal
[3:45:31] <Psyramics> @PatStaresAt belts have too lanes
[3:45:31] <Visorak6> Just make a second miner and have it belt to the other furnace
[3:45:40] <+LittleBigQuebec> Wait pat
[3:45:40] <+D00msDayDan> feed it straight to the existing belt and see what happens
[3:45:50] <KShirahama> you can have two resources on one belt
[3:45:53] <+LittleBigQuebec> belts have 2 sides @PatStaresAt
[3:45:59] <+Kinoskae> Pat, you need 5 years, lol
[3:45:59] <HeWhoMonologues> Brual
[3:45:59] <%walternatorz> gotta piss out the anxiety?
[3:46:00] <doster504> your inserter can grab both from same belt
[3:46:00] <+D00msDayDan> that's ok pat
[3:46:02] <+StrudleBum> It's alright
[3:46:03] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> brain do a big hurt
[3:46:04] <Noogiez> those things remind me of zergs
[3:46:07] <%Monkeyweed21> BUT BABA
[3:46:08] <iosephe> These bugs are super frustrating
[3:46:09] <+zepelinnn1> pat panicking live on stream
[3:46:09] <%MelBrooksKA> Take your time
[3:46:10] <LoneFonte> no prob
[3:46:11] <$Hommando> The game is brutal at first
[3:46:12] <SiegmundCG> Factorio might be a step too deep into this rabbit hole
[3:46:13] <%justcallmebobplease> He's fighting them goblins as hard as he can.
[3:46:16] <%justcallmebobplease> But they are so strong.
[3:46:17] <%AncelDeLambert> this is why I and tons of other people play with bugs turned off
[3:46:23] <HeWhoMonologues> "Imma need a stronger drink for this" said Pat.
[3:46:27] <Tempmael> those bugs are hella annoying in the tutorial
[3:46:30] <%metalicblackcherry> you could just start a new game and have no bugs on the map @PatStaresAt
[3:46:34] <doster504> I would honestly say it'd be easier to learn from starting the game and turning bugs off
[3:46:41] <%solracc25> THE BUGS. EDF
[3:46:43] <%tebari> I'll admit having to both learn the game and deal with bugs is stressful.
[3:46:49] <%metalicblackcherry> @PatStaresAt well have no bugs attack you
[3:46:54] <LoneFonte> @metalicblackcherry it's the tutorial, i don't think he can turn them off already
[3:46:58] <%MelBrooksKA> @metalicblackcherry It's the tutorial
[3:47:21] <HeWhoMonologues> This game seems to want you to pause more to think about stuff and projects.
[3:47:21] <0range_> Why are they so bad in the tutorial anyway? yeah you need to be reminded that they are constant threat but you should learn that after the basics
[3:47:22] <echobee_tv> Square Pat figure when?
[3:47:28] <KShirahama> Yeah, it seems bug danger makes Pat feel time anxiety
[3:47:46] <$jacob2pop> Pat I mean this in the nicest way possible, but the level of anxiety watching you play this is giving me is astounding
[3:48:03] <HeWhoMonologues> Its the game saying hurry the hell up.
[3:48:19] <Decarcassor> The tutorial is just... bad.
[3:48:22] <0range_> In the normal game the bugs wont even attack you for a long time
[3:48:26] <doster504> could he not go to bugs house and shoot up the place
[3:48:49] <%MelBrooksKA> @doster504 He would die immediately without an SMG
[3:48:53] <LoneFonte> @doster504 you need a LITTLE more firepower for that
[3:48:56] <HeWhoMonologues> Thats why he needs the sub
[3:48:57] <%AncelDeLambert> not without grenades he can't
[3:49:00] <dfs_k> i'd think the satisfactory to factorio skill set is transferable, but this is interesting
[3:49:04] <$jacob2pop> @doster504 he'll need way more ammo and an smg before even thinking about it
[3:49:12] <%AncelDeLambert> grenades are a builder's best friend
[3:49:23] <doster504> oh I didn't know if they had worms yet
[3:49:27] <%FoxEarsOak> once you have the machine gun and remember to stock bullets, the bugs are less of a problem
[3:49:28] <HeWhoMonologues> Looking at things from more than just one angle visually helps as well.
[3:49:31] <KShirahama> Sure
[3:49:33] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> Tutorial was good for refreshing me, but idk how well it works as an onramp for newbs
[3:49:34] <%AncelDeLambert> brain do the big fry
[3:49:36] <%luftraumm1> dude
[3:49:37] <PinoProxie> PARTIAL ELMO
[3:49:37] <DianaTheAscian> oh no
[3:49:39] <%AncelDeLambert> you are HUGE Baba-ing
[3:49:41] <LoneFonte> no prob
[3:49:42] <ammobasket> sounds good!
[3:49:42] <@SoFarFetched> oh boy a Baba is you stream tomorrow? geefPlz
[3:49:43] <%MelBrooksKA> That's cool
[3:49:45] <%Running_Sets> psaJpeg
[3:49:46] <Siconia> Pat is baba
[3:49:46] <iosephe> sure thing
[3:49:48] <echobee_tv> elmo!!!
[3:49:49] <%Monkeyweed21> HOW CAN THIS BE
[3:49:49] <Noogiez> haha
[3:49:51] <+D00msDayDan> the bugs attacking whenever he's on the verge of figuring something out definitely isn't helping
[3:49:51] <%Emperor_Machinus> Paige-ing?
[3:49:53] <%AncelDeLambert> remember my man: Belts are storage
[3:49:54] <+StrudleBum> aww.. :(
[3:49:56] <@SoFarFetched> you might remember some things tomorrow.
[3:49:59] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun
[3:50:00] <HeWhoMonologues> Mush brain does not retain.
[3:50:00] <+TheWe4pon> i've never seen anybody actually play the tutorial.
[3:50:01] <huskarl_zap> Forget the tutorial
[3:50:01] <%asgard147> KITTY! limesAw psaWink
[3:50:03] <RyuuAoi> Pat is high
[3:50:03] <%Monkeyweed21> HOW CAN THIS BEEEE
[3:50:03] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> sick
[3:50:04] <LoneFonte> BUT THE COAL CEASES TO BE
[3:50:07] <+StrudleBum> well, you could
[3:50:09] <$Hommando> The boiler was full
[3:50:09] <%solracc25> Too sad to learn
[3:50:10] <RyuuAoi> It's okay, Pat. Me too..
[3:50:11] <@SoFarFetched> COAL IS YOU
[3:50:12] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt you could, you just blue screened
[3:50:13] <AmuserName> You CAN, it's just NOT NEEDED
[3:50:13] <%Daxalog> There was no space
[3:50:15] <balthazar758> oh man.
[3:50:16] <%Dunmarkh> you can
[3:50:21] <pth88> its not a puzzle pat
[3:50:21] <Oqzar> box was a trap
[3:50:21] <dfs_k> rest well pat
[3:50:21] <%bevyrage> use an arm to pull it out of the box and into the boiler then
[3:50:22] <KShirahama> they didn't
[3:50:23] <@SoFarFetched> CONVEYER IS BABA
[3:50:24] <%NopeBadguy> wait did i just walk into the end of the stream
[3:50:26] <Valdorick> POWER IS NOT SPENT IF YOU'RE NOT USING POWER
[3:50:28] <%solracc25> Stored forever
[3:50:31] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> that's ok, Astroneer introduced a tutorial and it was bad for a long time
[3:50:32] <+D00msDayDan> you just weren't reading the spacing right, there was more space in front of the boiler than you thought
[3:50:33] <%tebari> Baba is box
[3:50:40] <HeWhoMonologues> So yes
[3:50:40] <%NopeBadguy> i was in raid :(
[3:50:46] <%MelBrooksKA> The tutorial is pretty rough, I'd honestly recommend finding a friend whose played a bit and teaching you rather than using the tutorial @PatStaresAt
[3:50:56] <RyuuAoi> Pat go make clam chowder
[3:50:59] <buerdo> The box was just overflow
[3:51:06] <mesamus> pat you scheduled doom ancient gods part 2 already
[3:51:14] <mesamus> ?
[3:51:15] <%weissguard> Thanks for stream.
[3:51:16] <%NopeBadguy> wait which robin was paige
[3:51:18] <$jacob2pop> Do you have any friends who are currently playing it? If so maybe start a duo game and they can guide your hips into it.
[3:51:19] <%NopeBadguy> this is important
[3:51:36] <ShichiNoBushi> He became what he feared: a goblin.
[3:51:44] <RyuuAoi> Peach was black Robin
[3:51:47] <HeWhoMonologues> Lol, fair enough.
[3:52:04] <Noogiez> peace
[3:52:05] <HeWhoMonologues> LAters

[3:52:25] <%walternatorz> just make sure not to use Paige's brain
[3:52:31] <ammobasket> yeah, that needs a bit of concentration
[3:52:31] <%walternatorz> it's a bit used
[3:52:31] <%NopeBadguy> justianknight is streaming
