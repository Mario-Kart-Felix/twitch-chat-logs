[0:07:33] <CrabSlacks> yeah
[0:07:33] <%GoogleyGareth> Know what's more fucked up than that? Holding toilet paper when you take some off it.
[0:07:34] <$rdark_ksu> if I'm sleeping in my jeans it means my BAC is very high
[0:07:35] <EBT93> Yeah, that’s weird

[0:07:42] <+Roundelay11> putting dress slacks sounds even worse
[0:07:44] <%Paralurx> The jeans thing isn't weirder than pantsless bathroom adventures
[0:07:44] <%PipIV> pooping through onesies that have a butt flap
[0:07:44] <element_of_loyalty> @AngriestPat are you feelin ok?
[0:07:44] <Tuskor13> The only reason you put your jeans on to go to sleep is if you have to wake up early and go to like, the airport or something @AngriestPat
[0:07:51] <+Zerodyne90> why would anyone do that
[0:07:52] <%flying_hipp0> He's knows he's wrong so he's avoiding looking at chat
[0:07:53] <+AmericanaRed> JEANS 👖 IS WERE IS AT
[0:07:53] <+SirDracus> You know what's weirder than taking your pants off whilst you have a shit? HOLDING THE TOILET PAPER WHILST TAKING A PISS
[0:07:55] <%iwishthiswasicq> You're totally right Pat. Having your legs stuck together like some broke back cowboy hogtied your ass on the toilet is no way to shit.
[0:07:57] <element_of_loyalty> ELMO?
[0:07:58] <%Malikial> @AngriestPat You gonna shoot some more horses?

[1:17:30] <+Zairthos> Get a sea horse
[1:17:30] <megamonmon123> did the balls shrink though?
[1:17:31] <FoulNightingale> YEAYAR
[1:17:31] <%ThatRandomGuy661> @AngriestPat Do you know what Nonlethal means, perchance?
[1:17:33] <KanakoJiro> good thing cartridges were made at this time, or that gun would be useless now
[1:17:33] <$rdark_ksu> to be serious for a sec while horses do have the ability to swim, you riding a horse that is loaded down with your shit will affect the ability of success

[1:50:21] <+Thorn14> have you considered its to sleep on
[1:50:24] <count_bob> It's a bed.

[2:14:18] <count_bob> Pat's gonna die.
[2:14:19] <Outlitplug> Yogis fucking pissed
[2:14:19] <+luketrapwalker> I wouldn't use that bow, though.
[2:14:19] <%AncelDeLambert> if you want to hunt a bear you DAMN better use traps
[2:14:19] <MonsieurHedge> this is a 0/10 so far, not even one yeehaw

[2:14:45] <majindusto> Saijima would have Destroyed that Bear
[2:14:57] <%AncelDeLambert> @greasystreams *teleports behind bear* sorry kid
[2:14:58] <+JustToWatch> only a coward would use a shotgun with solid slugs, like they actually do in the real world. all a hero like pat needs is a .22
[2:15:00] <+ChrisAlgoo> Takamura the dang bear
[2:15:08] <rytisone> tame the bear to aid you in combat like in far cry primal
[2:15:11] <King___Crimson> Legendary Grizzly: Patriarch of the Grizzly clan

[2:15:19] <xeros720> punch the bear like yakoozies
[2:15:22] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Hunt the bear with only the bow you coward
[2:15:24] <+Mottyrob> Maybe carrots are a horse only thing
[2:15:25] <+SparkAfterDark> wild carrots are a lot tougher and not very sweet, but can have a lot of vitamins and minerals. You have to be careful where they're growing though, and it's a good idea to cook them first, tubers are notorious for being difficult or sometimes even toxic to digest without cooking
[2:15:27] <forevern2dust> you don't have to cook them or anything do you?
[2:15:28] <Al3xanderdelag> just get Kiryu to punch it
[2:15:33] <+furiousfurioso> provision pouch, not weapon wheel
[2:15:35] <phillips456> carrots in your satchel
[2:15:37] <TheMilhouseExperience> Fight the bear and then ride the bear into town.

[2:19:37] <+imextremelymanly> you got a lot of disposable items
[2:19:42] <prettypatties97> *as he takes 0 fucking meat
[2:19:42] <vectorcannonready> SMOKE
[2:19:42] <+WhyIDie> eating food from your inventory decreases your carrying weight? NotLikeThis
[2:19:47] <ravencloak13> Or cook some of that poisoned meat
[2:19:55] <%AncelDeLambert> you could totally build a sled out of pine branches to drag that bear back home with
[2:19:55] <%superorangerobin> Because Charles Ingalls had a muzzleloader and it takes like 20 seconds to reload one of those things
[2:19:57] <LordOfThePoultry> FailFish
[2:19:58] <Happy_Karl> Pretty sure that "Mature" meat means it's rotting.
[2:20:00] <greasystreams> If he forgets this pelt
[2:20:02] <%superorangerobin> So you best make sure the bear is dead
[2:20:03] <element_of_loyalty> LUL

[2:20:09] <+redstonej> MASSIVE LEGEND
[2:20:18] <@Mechz71> Nah Pat get used to the message. Your inventory space is low. That's all that means.
[2:20:19] <cerberuscarmine> ?
[2:20:19] <Xel_Gel> @AngriestPat gotta give it to a tracker so he can make a outfit I think you got the meat
[2:20:20] <+Havictos> Is this the same stream where his horse stared doing sick burnouts?
[2:20:22] <greasystreams> There he is
[2:20:22] <cerberuscarmine> pat
[2:20:22] <%AncelDeLambert> huh, there's no interface...

[2:20:25] <+Wrashis> did you hit its weak spot?
[2:20:28] <xeros720> don't you just get the item when you go back to the butcher guy?
[2:20:28] <greasystreams> The Fallen Titan
[2:20:36] <@Mechz71> you can only hold like 3 of 3 of some items
[2:20:37] <+Wrashis> did you carve the horn?
[2:20:38] <rytisone> cut that bear into pieces, this is your last resort
[2:20:38] <cerberuscarmine> its fine dont worry
[2:20:38] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> If that bear is so legendary why is it dead

[2:38:55] <%joylent_blue> cool
[2:38:58] <Guardiansaiyan> yup
[2:39:00] <+Thorn14> Man people really hate the slower pace of this game. I like its deliberate immersive pace
[2:39:00] <deviljhojho94> @Guardiansaiyan That might be true, but his killing skills are matched only by his incompetence

[2:40:24] <JackMillerTime> grave?
[2:40:29] <+SparkAfterDark> that actually requires a fair bit of training for most horses, and it's really uncommon to see a draught breed like yours doing it. Maybe it used to be a carriage horse since I don't think dressage was much of a thing in this time and place
[2:40:33] <%BeefyQueefer> Also Pat looks like a hobo in the game too
[2:40:36] <rytisone> his inner self is showing in the game
[2:40:37] <shallaska> is that a goddamn hobbit house?

[2:43:12] <CactusChef3> yeah it's not a good reason like "there's no room on my horse"
[2:43:13] <IminyourBase> I DISAGREE SAYS THE TRESPASSER
[2:43:15] <rytisone> what if someone just jumps in your house with a horse and a gun?
[2:43:16] <Guardiansaiyan> His name is PAT, the hobo sent by FUCK OFF
[2:43:17] <TheBlankAce> Not in real life obviously but the game is very diffferent
[2:43:19] <TerraWraith> You already have a bear hat? Jeez
[2:43:20] <+Dovakhin573> That the law in some place, you can legally shoot people who are trespassing your rland

[2:43:22] <Shiranui24> Pat was leaving and the guy said "come back"
[2:43:23] <3viltiki> historically accurate
[2:43:23] <alrobot2014> aren't there signs in some places that say trespassers will be shot on sight?
[2:43:25] <reonome> TIME TO SHOOT PAT
[2:43:26] <ravencloak13> You were standing on his house with a half ton horse.
[2:43:27] <%MaiHusbando9S> this heavily armed man wearing a bear as a hat just ran over my house NOPE NOT ALARMED AT ALL

[2:43:28] <+luketrapwalker> THE WILD WEST ISN'T THAT WILD ANYMORE
[2:43:31] <Shiranui24> and then he shot pat

[2:43:32] <+imextremelymanly> I swear there was a time when you said you would attack a person if they were in your house
[2:43:32] <god__of__lore> In THIS GAME people will shoot you for trespassing

[2:43:40] <Azaius> it's not stealing if the owner is dead
[2:43:42] <AthenaAegis> Pat "The Trespasser" Boivin Kappa
[2:43:43] <+TastySammiches> Pat you shot that woman for no reason 15 minutes ago
