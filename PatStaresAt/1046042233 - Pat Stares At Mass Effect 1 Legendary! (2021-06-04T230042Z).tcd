[0:02:07] <+rasend0ri> Pat still likes ponys?
[0:02:08] <Rei_Dsoto> Boom.
[0:02:10] <%DaKnightWarrior> hey guys.
[0:02:13] <Ipsenscastle> @GeneralSCPatton pretty sure he's leaving Kaiden, in order to more creatively punish Trashley
[0:02:17] <%YakumoYomi> Exterminate. Them. All.

[0:02:36] <%chance_h> chance_h subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Sorry Commander, can't talk right now I'm making some calibrations.
[0:02:37] <%X2Eliah> Imagine if Pat chooses to shoot Wrex tho
[0:02:38] <%jtdobyns> wish we could leave both on virmire
[0:02:44] <+rasend0ri> So what’s he playing today?
[0:03:02] <%X2Eliah> @rasend0ri FF14, probably
[0:03:11] <42nfl19> So are the Batarians a disposable race that no one cares if you kill?
[0:03:23] <%jtdobyns> though we might stop by McDonald's with Garrus later.
[0:03:23] <%AzureGale> Yeyeyeyeye
[0:03:26] <karl_rex> Pretty much yeah
[0:03:36] <peachy996> I think he's saving Ashley for later, I just hope he saves Kirrahe when he kills Kaiden
[0:03:44] <%X2Eliah> Batarians are basically the race of "shitties parts of humanity". Slavers, terrorists, etc.
[0:03:50] <%X2Eliah> shittiest*
[0:03:52] <peachy996> @42nfl19 Vorcha
[0:03:59] <ForrestKrump> I never paid much attention to the Mass Effect franchise and at this point I’m afraid to
[0:04:00] <karl_rex> They pretty much mostly get mad at Shepard for destroying a Mass Relay and not the Batarian colony
[0:04:05] <ForrestKrump> Same with Dead Space
[0:04:14] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @x2eliah shitties
[0:04:19] <peachy996> Oh shittiest? There is like 1 or 2 Batarians that don't hat your guts

[0:05:06] <%dekkitout> Friend PrideCute
[0:05:17] <%X2Eliah> You want to know how bad Batarians are, check out the Colonist-related side mission in Mass Effect 1, having to calm down a woman taken by batarian slavers at age 6.
[0:05:24] <%walternatorz> is that how they got their faces smooshed in the first place?
[0:05:34] <$Ziegsy> Oh look, an ad for days gone, who would play that? ziegsyEyes
[0:05:35] <%walternatorz> just two wolves smooshing
[0:05:46] <+LumberjackJack> He a good boy
[0:05:52] <peachy996> Yeah Colonist Mission is rough
[0:05:55] <+even_the_yuenglings> how far did we get at the end of last stream?
[0:06:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> I think Batarians literally believe that 2-eyed races have no souls. How ironic that the 4-eyed bastards actually are the ones lacking that feature.
[0:06:01] <%captainpodock> do you have baby disease Pat?
[0:06:04] <$Ziegsy> drink the boys water
[0:06:06] <%YakumoYomi> You moved the camera. He does not appreciate your disrespect.
