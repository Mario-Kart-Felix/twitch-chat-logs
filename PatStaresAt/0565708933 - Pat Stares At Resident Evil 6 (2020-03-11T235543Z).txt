[0:23:55] <Brother_Coduss> @PatStaresAt power rangers was cooler
[0:23:57] <%spiritofmojave> Kamen Rider should kick the Corona Virus
[0:23:58] <+PerrinIsDead> Japan sucks
[0:23:58] <biomegabear> BETTER
[0:24:00] <%juxtest> Monster May Kick, coming Spring 2020 from Patinum Games
[0:24:03] <%Aracon_> omikron is insufferable
[0:24:05] <+Blargimazombie> At least this is a game
[0:24:05] <augusta_wind> just one
[0:24:07] <%Aracon_> this is just bad
[0:24:08] <%peachy996> RE6 didn't crash
[0:24:09] <+boki_86> so CDPR confirmed that they have a team working on Witcher 4 but they will fully star after cyberpunk
[0:24:10] <+SargentToughie> RE6 has the benefit of being an actual video game
[0:24:10] <%CalderGaming> you can figure out where to go and you can save for free in RE6
[0:24:11] <%srkAres> i dont think anything can ever be worse than omicum
[0:24:12] <Senselessvirus> @floralkami you can watch it on tubitv but it was accidentally uploaded early so you have to wait till march 17th.
[0:24:12] <Coystick> Ewww video games
[0:24:13] <+thelonechris> Just put the virus in a petri dish and have him kick it
[0:24:13] <powerprotoman> the obvious answer is the kick is strong but its not garunteed death
[0:24:15] <%Skelegroove> A 6/10 is much better than a zero
[0:24:15] <%TheNewJapanGuy> That Woolie argument tho
[0:24:15] <%grotto_kein> Belitv is where to watch Rider
[0:24:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> omikron is just the incarnation of suffering
[0:24:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Death is better than OMIKRON
[0:24:20] <collind99> SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN IS STILL THE BEST ANIMATED SPIDEY SHOW AS WELL
[0:24:21] <%WhereIsWill> ppl DIED for omikron LUL
[0:24:21] <jerree66> I still sometimes watch that playthrough
[0:24:22] <biomegabear> OMIKRON MAKES ME WANT TO PLAY RIDE TO HELL
[0:24:22] <$floralkami> omikron isn't playable in most cases
[0:24:32] <%ConfusedEX> Yeah sure
[0:24:32] <Monkeyweed21> the trials of beaker
[0:24:33] <%vectorless_peon> yes
[0:24:35] <$floralkami> @senselessvirus thank you
[0:24:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> or the dark souls character??
[0:24:39] <%Dhurkst> Only Leon S Kennedy can save us from coronavirus.
[0:24:40] <+PenmanLupine> like my barber?
[0:24:42] <%Aracon_> oscar was my favorite muppet
[0:24:42] <%derekwst3> omikron took (REDACTED) soul away making him leave the SBF
[0:24:43] <%wingblade7> @PatStaresAt what're your thoughts on Detroit Become Human now that it's been out for a while
[0:24:45] <+Pendragwn> RE6 is actually a game that doesn't hurt you to play. Omikron fails at even that.
[0:24:46] <%xUmbraNinja> Wtf is omnikron?
[0:24:48] <+Lunarhawk> Oscar lives in garbage pat
[0:24:49] <s1rcuit> Beaker's Revenge
[0:24:50] <ShichiNoBushi> @BallerSwagBro9k But then you just possess someone else.
[0:24:50] <+vectorless_peon> The muppet must fight the demon on the roof
[0:24:51] <starer_of_the_staring> Could Omikron have been saved if it were an anime instead of a video game? Has David Cage missed his true calling?
[0:24:51] <%OToole42> visible confusion
[0:24:55] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Never
[0:24:56] <%cTAKU> Kamen Rider should be on Tubi on MArch 17th. Never heard of it but going to check it out

[0:25:36] <%SunnyVarietyPack> same\
[0:25:38] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat didn't play as the second character in each campaign, so he only did 50%

[0:51:38] <BoneofMalkav> @TheBitingIrish You haven't seen Ms Cacodemon from Golden Souls 2 mod yet then? THAT's cursed.
[0:51:38] <%AmericanaRed> SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote
[0:51:39] <Lockpickgamer> R I V E T I N G gameplay
[0:51:40] <j0ustar> I read that as POS thumb drive for a sec there
[0:51:40] <%Aracon_> right
[0:51:42] <$joylent_blue> sure
[0:51:43] <%michingmallecho> I‚Äôm so glad the recent RE games have been good.anyone who says this game is underrated can go to hell. Straight to hell.
[0:51:51] <%EarleRiser> Remember when Jake's friends all turned into fly zombies an hour ago? Let's keep on snarking!
[0:51:52] <%Aracon_> THOSE SUCK REAL HARD
[0:51:52] <%tank7013> Universally terrible
[0:51:53] <Deadbulky> dont know what diagetic means so /shrug
[0:51:55] <%arancet> it's absurdly lucky finding a USB out in the snow in the middle of a blizzard
[0:51:56] <%vectorless_peon> YES
[0:51:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I agree.
[0:51:58] <%Scarnehu> this doesn't seem so bad. I mean yeah, it's bad, but is this really worst level in the game?
[0:52:00] <$joylent_blue> no but lampshade tho
[0:52:01] <%JJCheeker> This game is god awwwwful
[0:52:01] <+nathandiel> Who wants to play this with me
[0:52:02] <%spiritofmojave> Drakengard 3 did this so much
[0:52:02] <natebud> This is boring and bad isn't it? haha
[0:52:06] <%valkuma> when chris is like "This sucks!" while you are just gunning down things
[0:52:07] <a_mad_dragon> it does at the start of Blood Dragon
[0:52:08] <%michingmallecho> I took a film class. I understand pt
[0:52:11] <Cybersoul666> YEAH RE6 TIME
[0:52:12] <%Aracon_> Man where are aaaall these guys coming from
[0:52:14] <+NitronStreams> i just listened to someone make that same complaint
[0:52:22] <TikanZK> youre about to do some POGGERS shit
[0:52:23] <gollygee> God I hate Jake
[0:52:23] <%Scarnehu> slide uphill!!
[0:52:25] <j0ustar> "I have to murder 400 people AGAIN!?"
[0:52:26] <rcand9> 6 has outrageously bad music for a capcom game
[0:52:28] <%michingmallecho> Breaking the 4th wall
[0:52:32] <stabbityrabbit> I hope that those three USBs don't have the info at all. Instead it's just Sherry's porn stash, and she doesn't want anyone to see the weird shit she's into.
[0:52:33] <$WackyXmand> What am I in a video game?!
[0:52:34] <%AmericanaRed> HOW
[0:52:35] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Funny he mentions Nathan Drake while. playing uncharted 3 right now
[0:52:37] <EuropanLamprey> "Hey, we know this part sucks but we didn't bother to not make it suck, but at least give us points for self-awareness"
[0:52:37] <%SunnyVarietyPack> I gotta do a work thing I'll be back soon
[0:52:37] <%Laecerelius> BLUD!
[0:52:39] <$lotharrio> It's okay-ish in sequels where they call out some shit aspect of gameplay in a previous release.
[0:52:40] <%Dhurkst> Duke Nukem Forever: "Aw fuck, not another puzzle!"
[0:52:42] <ShershaAD> @rcand9 except the main title theme
[0:52:43] <+Soulsbjorne> the real friends were the Uncharted we made along the way
[0:52:44] <%cervidaequus> @aracon_ antarctic umbrella base from cvx
[0:52:45] <%derekwst3> @PatStaresAt just think of something fun
[0:52:45] <%nothollowyet> are we in horsefuck valley from DS2?
[0:52:46] <%connos_procrastination> just think about R3make and plough ahead pantrick
[0:52:47] <natebud> I can't believe I have to go on a key hunt, game devs amirite?
[0:52:48] <+NitronStreams> "Man this game sucks" said by character in game that sucks
[0:52:49] <$joylent_blue> makes the character just seem like a whiner too
[0:52:52] <yeetdabsenpai69> BLUUUUH
[0:52:54] <%vectorless_peon> Diagetic complaints in a game where the gameplay is awful i alwys go :THEN WHY DIDNT YOU FIX IT DEVS?"
[0:52:55] <TomFrank> the whole game is bad though
[0:52:55] <+thelonechris> Lets go rest in the cabin that's surrounded by all these zombies slavs
[0:52:56] <%SundanceShot> i don't remember much about re 6 but i remember i really hated this level for some reason
[0:52:58] <$lotharrio> Man, this music sure seems tense.
[0:53:00] <jorniev> SLIIIIIIIDEEEE
[0:53:00] <+starzo0> how can the same shit happen to the same guy twice
[0:53:05] <%KishinGrek> I hate steam puzzles
[0:53:06] <%asgard147> no but it BAD thou Pat!
[0:53:10] <%Aracon_> @cervidaequus oh okay, alright that makes sense then
[0:53:10] <ShershaAD> time to be the total devils advocate... i like this game
[0:53:12] <jorniev> hoooonk hooonk
[0:53:13] <%cureneckbeard> non-diagetically terrible
[0:53:14] <smig> Why did they make all these snowy assets if they were just going to make a shitty key hunt level with them?
[0:53:15] <$joylent_blue> üé∫ DOOT DOOT
[0:53:15] <+prime_name> Could they not make a better UI for the USBs?
[0:53:16] <%Ganerumo> you could tell me the music is randomized and I'd believe you
[0:53:17] <%EarleRiser> "Sherry why do these disks all talk about continuing the Redfield bloodline?" UwU
[0:53:18] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> I do not remember this music at all
[0:53:20] <Monkeyweed21> ghost lightbulbs
[0:53:20] <EuropanLamprey> Oh man, I really wish the game would let you fence hop into the abyss
[0:53:21] <%Dhurkst> @vectorless_peon not enough time/budget, probably
[0:53:21] <%AmericanaRed> GIRAFFE TRUMPETS
[0:53:22] <+NitronStreams> Makes it sound like they WANTED the game to be shit
[0:53:23] <+Toxic_Cizzle> I really do hope they bring back action RE. You know, without fucking it up
[0:53:24] <WonkierMk2> oh pat got to the best mission in the game already?
[0:53:24] <%Dementedpenguin> I'm genuinely happy Capcom didn't make future RE games like this......
[0:53:24] <%Parapattern> Menacing Honking
[0:53:27] <%InugamiTheHound> don't like french horns?
[0:53:28] <%derekwst3> what would goku do?
[0:53:29] <$lotharrio> Did that zombie say, "Run Jacob?"
[0:53:30] <+Karebuncle> this is bad but i still think the Chris/Piers boat/helicopter/car chase is worse
[0:53:31] <%ammobasket> "AWW THIS SUCKS" only works when it doesn't actually suck
[0:53:33] <%WhereIsWill> Most generic ost I've ever heard
[0:53:33] <%cervidaequus> Doot doot dootootoot
[0:53:33] <%Erimos> I like this game but it's still a bad game.
[0:53:33] <%KishinGrek> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[0:53:34] <ShimmerFairy> Basically, acknowledging bad game design doesn't make it good.
[0:53:34] <%vectorless_peon> THE TRUMPETS ARE WEIRD AND MISUED
[0:53:35] <%srkAres> you know what has great music? ori
[0:53:35] <%PlainSimpleTailor> That's a good sign

[0:53:41] <%Marpolo13> and still failing
[0:53:43] <jorniev> playing it is worse than watching it?
[0:53:43] <%spiritofmojave> YES
[0:53:44] <BoneofMalkav> It's the type of music that says "We want to be cinematic with half of the budget."
[0:53:44] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Song of blackout drunk tension
[0:53:45] <%Aracon_> this looks good to control
[0:53:47] <%Dhurkst> SPEED RUN
[0:53:48] <rytisone> now I RIDE the snowmobile
[0:53:50] <Galacta_Pieta> I cant even imagine how long this level takes doing it normally

[0:53:51] <+thelonechris> Why did they make him so massive?
[0:53:52] <+nathandiel> This is the coronavirus theme song
[0:53:53] <+VaudevilleVillain93> This fuckin snowmobile tho
[0:53:55] <$joylent_blue> CAN'T SEE SHIT

[0:53:58] <%Aracon_> YEAH NICE LEVEL DESIGN
[0:53:59] <EuropanLamprey> You know what's overrated? Actually seeing the level
[0:54:01] <%asgard147> limesLUL
[0:54:02] <cuttingwolfe22> This looks terrible
[0:54:04] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That's fucking horrible.
[0:54:06] <%Dementedpenguin> What the actual hell is happening.
[0:54:09] <%spiritofmojave> it's easier to just slide forever
[0:54:10] <Manmadeawesome> what is going on
[0:54:10] <%Ner234> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat, do you think you would have ever beaten RE6 if your AI Partner could die? How much more annoying would it be?
[0:54:11] <%Dhurkst> First you LISTEN, then you SEE
[0:54:16] <MrGreenToS> Just slide down
[0:54:16] <%arancet> now do it co-op
[0:54:17] <%Jekado> doesn't have to program the level if you can't see it
[0:54:18] <%wingblade7> why are there 3 wii remotes on the screen?
[0:54:20] <%baronblank> i haven't been keeping up with re6, is this the worst level in the game?
[0:54:22] <%neVan0> this fuckin circus music
[0:54:23] <%JJCheeker> what is the point
[0:54:24] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Is this supposed to be wacky-zany?
[0:54:24] <Ayy_Nick17> BOM BOM
[0:54:25] <%KishinGrek> It Would take you a while , the combat is padding
[0:54:25] <%Huntercd> I quit the game on this level @PatStaresAt
[0:54:25] <%vectorless_peon> the brass section needs to chill out!
[0:54:26] <%krawtch> this is like a Unity game before Unity was half good
[0:54:26] <$lotharrio> Why are there three USBs?
[0:54:26] <%rytyoung> Coro-na Virus! Coro-na Virus!
[0:54:29] <Ipsenscastle> Are those three WIIMOTES on the screen???
[0:54:29] <Monkeyweed21> Sherry has /SS/ on those USBs
[0:54:30] <%cervidaequus> @wingblade7 the 4 usbs of dna
[0:54:34] <tolloponik> this is a Wii cod level
[0:54:35] <ShimmerFairy> They aren't USBs, they're DATA CHIPS.
[0:54:36] <hat_under_bread> But not being able to see anything makes it atmospheric.
[0:54:36] <natebud> Terminal velocity
[0:54:37] <%derekwst3> what would jesus say, get on this side of the table if you want in the picture

[0:54:54] <SaltyAzteca> He just felt like runnin!!!

[0:54:58] <hat_under_bread> And atmosphere is way more important than gameplay.
[0:54:58] <%Aracon_> they would be COMPLETELY LOST

[0:59:46] <Jane_Lo> Oh hey, REMEMBER RE4
[0:59:53] <Graxe_> It killed the G-Embryo, but it stabilized the G-Virus in Sherry
[0:59:55] <%rytyoung> @ultimatefool but not enough
[0:59:56] <%MajorCrasher> why did Whesker or no one else use the g virus and then the vaccine?
[0:59:56] <Joestar1890> RE7 was a GODSEND

[1:00:17] <%Nope80808> @MisterRockett hes literally the only good thing about this game. he's got combos and shit.
[1:00:18] <+Sulfur_Boride> The G sample Birkin injected into himself was that the mitosis was nonstop, and that's why he mutated. So I guess the "perfected" G virus is super quick regeneration that stops the mitosis properly?
[1:00:18] <%cervidaequus> I cant evensee whats happening
[1:00:18] <%rytyoung> Ok that was a good
[1:00:18] <DatAsuna> Sherry has cool melee too

[1:09:28] <+heavenlygunner> This is the David Cage of Resident Evils.
[1:09:29] <natebud> he has one eye and even that's not a very good eye
[1:09:29] <Plague_bagel> ustanak can only see when the plot says
[1:09:30] <+Tornix> it's like when your party hides in the lab in FF7
[1:09:31] <%LaughingCatt> His senses are based on the plot
[1:09:32] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @PatStaresAt This is a game! SeemsGood
[1:09:32] <ClumzyDragon> there is no time to see things pat

[1:10:01] <+generalcanada99> This guy is everything nemesis isn't

[1:10:26] <%goose_attack_almanac> how did that helicopter not cut him in half
[1:10:28] <%Maids4lyfe> because cum virus
[1:10:29] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> he got better
[1:10:29] <natebud> bulletproof organs
[1:10:31] <iwa5h4ck3d> he can heal probably
[1:10:32] <+Grayhammatter> Ustanak? more like USTANOT
[1:10:33] <+OhioNitsud> plot armor
[1:10:33] <rcand9> he cant regenerate because hes missing an arm
[1:10:33] <%Typhaeon> Having all the items in chests be boring XP boosts is so uninspired
[1:10:33] <hat_under_bread> Because video games.
[1:10:33] <%Sir_stride> because shut up
[1:10:33] <Fro5tburn> NO TIME TO EXPLAIN
[1:10:34] <$lotharrio> Too angry to die.
[1:10:34] <conflict1914> because he's THE BIG STRONG
[1:10:35] <%krawtch> his number is too big
[1:10:36] <%Jumpie8> plot armor?
[1:10:36] <ExpressNode> Stink bugs ejecting their black fart gas
[1:10:36] <%Maids4lyfe> he plugs the bullets with cum
[1:10:37] <%Mr_Strut> Sub-dermal armor?
[1:10:38] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> he's resistance pat. nememis bled too
[1:10:42] <%dalmek> The blood is metaphorical

[1:10:46] <BalloniWright> nitpick
[1:10:47] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt he made of big meat. big meat gooder.
[1:10:48] <jjetfuel> lisa trevor can take bullets but she is immortal too, isn't she?
[1:10:48] <%optimasmaximas> @PatStaresAt remember that for later when you beat his campaign
[1:10:49] <Dumple_Roe> his villan contract said he can't die yet
[1:10:49] <%vectorless_peon> hes too dumb to die pat obviously
[1:10:49] <%cervidaequus> He is eternal RAGE (blonde)
[1:10:51] <Animorphimagi> Regen
[1:10:53] <%PlainSimpleTailor> It sucks even more Calrissian
[1:10:57] <DracaenaLeaf> These bugs are blind
[1:10:57] <+Karebuncle> Ustanak regenerates, just not wildly like birkin or whatever
[1:10:57] <$joylent_blue> eyyyyy
[1:10:58] <gekizenbu> aactually scratch that, 90 10
[1:10:59] <TioXyco> he's dumb enough to not understand he should be dead

[1:11:03] <DeltascapeV4> That's a big 1, cause Nemesis and Mr. X bled too
[1:11:08] <%vectorless_peon> just like a starfish
[1:11:09] <Ipsenscastle> What the fuck is this BAT PATROL
[1:11:10] <OpenMikeLive> GAMEPLAY

[1:11:11] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt What are these particle effects
[1:11:14] <$lotharrio> He got shot, just a little bit, every day, until he built up an immunity.
[1:11:14] <%Tieliva> holy fuck this chapter is like a greatest hits of shittiest 2010s game mechanics
[1:11:15] <%Erimos> This is simpler than MGS1 stealth and that's saying a lot.
[1:11:16] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[1:11:18] <+IShadowStrykerI> Because hes meant to invoke nemesis even though his story is that he's actually a BIG failure and should be dead...

[1:11:37] <+NitronStreams> I want to refund this game and i dont even own it.
[1:11:39] <gazingeye1> @PatStaresAt sub-dermal armour and redundant organs would explain it surviving.

[2:22:01] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @StaceMcGate Do you think the tank and helicopter segments are karmic justice for skipping DMC2?
[2:22:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat's screaming at the universe huh
[2:22:03] <starer_of_the_staring> DMC2 next confirmed.
[2:22:08] <%shocknawful> I see the chinese have equipped their helicopters with ballistics
[2:22:09] <CrazyMedicine> It's time to break DMC2 Glass

[2:22:23] <Reizie_Etherealm> DMC2 might be boring but at least the core game isn't broken and buggy all to shit
[2:22:24] <munchkay> Suzi is a fan of Vinny I see
[2:22:25] <%krawtch> RE6 has more melee combat than DMC2
[2:22:27] <%xUmbraNinja> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:22:27] <+Arizon1317> Why not use a catheter?
[2:22:27] <%Shadicara> What is the under over of getting pat to play DMC 2 since he's played ALL of 6
[2:22:29] <%StaceMcGate> DMC2 took itself very seriously
[2:22:33] <%TheSphereHunter> I'll cover 6 after 0,4,5

[2:23:32] <%xUmbraNinja> We all have the corona
[2:23:34] <%ssjklyco> Why establish Sherry heals if you won't impliment it in the gameplay? She doesn't have to auto heal, just make one herb heal more pips and faster melee regen
[2:23:34] <%krawtch> Tom Hanks is rich so they'll just replace all of his blood and organs with those from healthy 12 year old children

[2:24:29] <GUNxSPECTRE> Ligma Virus
[2:24:29] <rytisone> Leon's seed cures the C-Virus, which pretty much means we're screwed
[2:24:29] <munchkay> @optimasmaximas I don't know, just goofing
[2:24:31] <%shocknawful> Noita's wand building will either enrage or engage his goblins
[2:24:33] <%GalacticaPhanto> I live in NC so the chances that shit will hit hard is 100%

[2:25:34] <Reizie_Etherealm> I hope you guys are doing ok in the US
[2:25:36] <%peachy996> They were right to cancel E3
[2:25:43] <%Frost_Quill> So why are these guys so loyal to Neo-Umbrella? Their lives have to be pretty shit now.
[2:25:44] <munchkay> @optimasmaximas You though I was being for real. God no, that'd be horrible
[2:25:46] <GUNxSPECTRE> The Pres IRL is as effective as his game's Pres
[2:25:47] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Don't worry about Corona guys, the ocean is turning blue, so none of this matters anyways.

[2:25:52] <+luketrapwalker> Okay, I think he might be pooping now.
[2:25:57] <%Aracon_> pat is taking a big piss huh
[2:25:59] <Dragon_Batman> The Hunt really does look like c movie shlock
[2:26:02] <%krawtch> Rudy Gobert made a concerted effort to touch every microphone and voice recorder in front of him, and immediately got corona virus
[2:26:03] <%DEETRz> DEETRz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[2:26:04] <%Typhaeon> Thankfully there have only been 5 C-virus cases in my state
[2:26:06] <bear_breaker20> C virus cancelled my moms teenage fantasy to see pearl jam, im laughing now
[2:26:07] <iamnotaparrot> anime boston still isn't cancelled even though Boston MA is issuing a state of emergency
[2:26:09] <rytisone> I just hope we get next instalment in Devolver Digital E3 Cinematic Universe
[2:26:11] <+Grayhammatter> taking a huge piss and/or shit

[2:26:25] <%peachy996> @King_Wolf_Rigger Well we're all gonna die anyway sooner or later. Might as well enjoy life each day....by watcing Pat play RE6
[2:26:30] <wrydiculous> No deaths on my side because of the early detection
[2:26:31] <bear_breaker20> what does being racist have to do with c virus?
[2:26:32] <$joylent_blue> just chill out in your home and wait for all of this to blowwww over FeelsGoodMan
[2:26:32] <%xeros720> i'd believe that, fuckin antivaxers
[2:26:33] <%EndlessScrapper> My state will have a explosion of new cases. They only started testing for it this week
[2:26:36] <ExpressNode> We're all gonna die anyway it will just be sooner now
[2:26:36] <%Frost_Quill> Wasn't there a US politician that got Coronavirus after making fun of people panicking over it?
[2:26:38] <%spiritofmojave> don't buy face-masks if you're not sick!
[2:26:39] <+luketrapwalker> @krawtch I saw that on twitter. What a dumbass.
[2:26:40] <%Typhaeon> @Muzzle131 Skid Row had, what, scarlet fever?
[2:26:45] <Hellarussian> how can Corona be real if noses aren't real
[2:26:46] <%StaceMcGate> U.S. is ranked only 8th in Corona cases, I thought we were #1 at everything
[2:26:48] <Oxybe> @vectorless_peon wasn't LA basically hobo pooptown already? CVirus on top of the Plague.
[2:26:50] <natebud> @Frost_Quill Gaetz, florida man
[2:26:51] <+Pookiedaexzile> Dont worry guys, We're all well under the Death Range on ages....Who knows we might all have it soon...oly the strong survive
[2:26:51] <%lethargicviewer> <3 Pat <3 Salty Peach <3
[2:26:51] <GUNxSPECTRE> Maybe Corona will make the US adopt the bidet on masse
[2:26:54] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @peachy996 It's a good way to wait out the dying bit lol.
[2:26:58] <%Binary_Fireball> LA isn't that bad

[2:27:15] <%Binary_Fireball> but it really depends on where in LA
[2:27:18] <%Typhaeon> That Demo D vid was a throwback to the good/bad old days of youtube
[2:27:19] <%mighty_max_t> You know whats a fun game but I hate the entire tone? Saints Row 4
[2:27:21] <jerree66> @StaceMcGate That's probably because we're like number one at not testing for it right now lmao
[2:27:21] <%StaceMcGate> Demolition D released his halloween video from 2016

[2:32:05] <%InvisibleMan101> don't forget you're here forever
[2:32:06] <natebud> YES
[2:32:06] <+Sulfur_Boride> So as DMC was originally meant to be Resident Evil, this Resident Evil is bootleg DMC
[2:32:06] <%ssjklyco> Yes
[2:32:06] <SainEdge> this game is clearly the best in the series :)
[2:32:06] <tiger_guard> I am watching this just to suffer
[2:32:07] <%Shadicara> Absolutely
[2:32:07] <Neo_Kaiser> In this next section, do the chopper QTE!

[2:32:11] <karl_rex> YES
[2:32:11] <mankeytennis> Yep
[2:32:12] <jorniev> NO
[2:32:12] <%Skittlesoul> Im enjoying the suffering
[2:32:13] <wrydiculous> OH BOY
[2:32:14] <+samirrsp> YES
[2:32:15] <biomegabear> YES?
[2:32:15] <rcand9> probably
[2:32:15] <+StoicMoogle> A contrast of good and bad?
[2:32:15] <%LaughingCatt> YES
[2:32:16] <%derekwst3> you can finish ada tonight
[2:32:16] <%cervidaequus> Absolutely yes
[2:32:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> does bruno Mars is gay?
[2:32:17] <%Shadicara> OH BOY
[2:32:17] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Yes, regardless of what order you play them in.
[2:32:18] <%vectorless_peon> it might be
[2:32:18] <%Laecerelius> Leon's seems worse than Chris'
[2:32:18] <DatAsuna> No chris is worst
[2:32:18] <EuropanLamprey> If you didn't constantly stall playing this game, we'd be free of this shit
[2:32:19] <%spiritofmojave> MHM
[2:32:19] <jorniev> CHRIS IS THE WORST
[2:32:20] <Reizie_Etherealm> And ADA IS THE WORST OF ALL
[2:32:20] <%krawtch> the worst RE6 campaign is whatever one you are currently on
[2:32:20] <%OToole42> yes, in its own way
[2:32:21] <+gibbetterinternet> Do Ada COOP
[2:32:21] <%TheSphereHunter> Here's like the worst part of Jake's
[2:32:22] <CloniiCory> As someone who is also playing through RE6. It's better to watch then play lol.
[2:32:22] <+Sp3ctre48> Is it really?
[2:32:23] <%spiritofmojave> ADA IS AWFUL
[2:32:24] <+Grayhammatter> the wurstest
[2:32:24] <sexdrugsvideogames> makes sense
[2:32:26] <%Dapper_Cactuar> ADA'S IS STEALTH BASED
[2:32:27] <%corepercentlives> but dat ass
[2:32:27] <JetpackMcQuack> This game exists to make RE7 look good
[2:32:27] <KeystoneA1> You're finishing this game tonight, coward.
[2:32:28] <kingbaconcrispy> Nah Chris is a low point.
[2:32:29] <%ssjklyco> I thought Ada's was gonna be fine, but it became RE 6 after 10 minutes
[2:32:29] <%shocknawful> RE6: something some dedicated fans may call a "game"
[2:32:30] <%xUmbraNinja> Idk Chris is the worst to me personally
[2:32:30] <%Huntercd> I blame twitter for this
[2:32:30] <jijipose> At least on Ada's you don't have to deal with an AI dipshit
[2:32:31] <%camsool> NO GOD JUST END IT ALREADY.
[2:32:32] <jjetfuel> chris' one is worse
[2:32:33] <morow1ec> Adas is hot trash
[2:32:33] <Dragon_Batman> I still think Chris's the worst
[2:32:33] <tiger_guard> but ada's hot so its tolerable
[2:32:33] <Neo_Kaiser> Do the chopper QTE!
[2:32:34] <%Lizard0TM> the Tank and Helicopter are straight up from DMC2
[2:32:34] <%StaceMcGate> LOOK AT THIS ENEMY, TAKE IT IN
[2:32:34] <Mephiem> No, nothing is worse than Chris'.
[2:32:35] <WonkierMk2> you get to play as "some dude" in co-op though @PatStaresAt
[2:32:35] <$lotharrio> Pffff-what the fuck?
[2:32:36] <%Shadicara> WITH LEGS
[2:32:36] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Hey Pat can you make a random noise
[2:32:36] <%Aarseth> RIGHT IN THE CLOACA
[2:32:36] <$joylent_blue> YEAH JUST KICK HIM A LIL BIT
[2:32:37] <%Typhaeon> I cannot get over the ancient American catacombs and falling through the center of the Earth in Leon's
[2:32:37] <kingbaconcrispy> Ada, os, inconsistent.
[2:32:38] <iosephe> neat enemies
[2:32:39] <+FrontLineFluffyBunny> how can is get worse? wait nevermine I dont wannna know....
[2:32:40] <Hellarussian> idk lol
[2:32:40] <%peachy996> Yay Cricket Men
[2:32:42] <rytisone> FISTS
[2:32:43] <+Pendragwn> NO ADA IS THE BEST BECAUSE IT'S NOTHING BUT BUTT SHOTS FOR LIKE HOURS
[2:32:46] <ireliaismaiwaifu> punch da choppa
[2:32:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> die?
[2:32:47] <wrydiculous> PUNCH CHOPPER
[2:32:47] <iwa5h4ck3d> Chris and Piers tho BibleThump
[2:32:47] <%spiritofmojave> KARATE
[2:32:48] <%cervidaequus> BIG KICK POWER
[2:32:48] <TafferAA> RPGs take down copters, they aren't that hard
[2:32:48] <+Grayhammatter> guess it'll just die
[2:32:48] <yourliteraldog> Oh god hers is stealth what the fuck capcom
[2:32:51] <DatAsuna> @TheSphereHunter I find the spinny room with the regenerators is way worse
[2:32:53] <natebud> Bear commander Chris
[2:32:53] <Zebroneath> Punch the helicopter. Punching is working well so far.
[2:32:56] <%Binary_Fireball> at least those guys look cool
[2:32:58] <bsmusic> He's so insecure
[2:32:59] <egg_bun> Any section with grasshopper legs is the worst
[2:33:02] <tiaramaki> How long have you HAD THOSE?
[2:33:03] <%vectorless_peon> I hate these grasshpper fucks the most its the thing i think of when i think of RE6
[2:33:03] <%StaceMcGate> PARKOUR
[2:33:04] <%peachy996> This is such a blatant Uncharted rip
[2:33:04] <RenegadeEpsilon> that enemy Lol
[2:33:06] <%krawtch> Y I K E S
[2:33:07] <Neo_Kaiser> Chopper QTE!
[2:33:07] <tiger_guard> @Pendragwn yeah the best campaign ever
[2:33:10] <$WackyXmand> what is his hate boner for chris about?
[2:33:10] <Neo_Kaiser> It's fun!
[2:33:11] <%peachy996> Even Jake sounds like Drake
[2:33:11] <%cervidaequus> Especially against living copters
[2:33:11] <CloniiCory> Someone at Capcom was very convinced Jake was cool.
[2:33:14] <%Psych_man13_13> So Leon isn‚Äôt the best, his campaign is just the least bad
[2:33:15] <+luketrapwalker> So, he's a gymnastics man now?
[2:33:16] <BlacSoul> WHY WERENT YOU USING THEM EARLIER
[2:33:17] <+StoicMoogle> Whats with these Uncharted climbing scenes?
[2:33:17] <%corepercentlives> Ada campaign is ass literally Kappa
[2:33:17] <+gibbetterinternet> when RE6 first launched people didn't know how to activate grenade launcher so they couldn't beat the level LUL
[2:33:18] <%Shadicara> BEAR COMMANDAR
[2:33:18] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd atpRtsd atpRtsd
[2:33:19] <Neo_Kaiser> With a Magnum!
[2:33:21] <%Marpolo13> why si this still going
[2:33:22] <%spiritofmojave> I'd love it if he supplexed the chopper
[2:33:24] <zaquedidit> imagine not playing a good game or series
[2:33:26] <wrydiculous> This part is the worst, because of how hard it is to actually shoot the chopper as Jake
[2:33:27] <jorniev> BTW JAKE IS SUPOSED TO BE PLAYED FIRST
[2:33:30] <rcand9> irredeemable trash
[2:33:32] <%wampa661> Ada‚Äôs is just a highlight reel of the worst moments from everyone else‚Äôs campaigns plus a shitty submarine
[2:33:35] <%krawtch> this is some shit ass dick farts
[2:33:36] <Neo_Kaiser> He uses a magnum if you do the QTE
[2:33:40] <ALTRNico> Sherry pls
[2:33:40] <yourliteraldog> BEAR COMMANDER WIth CUB Lt.
[2:33:41] <%Shadicara> To look fantastic obviously
[2:33:41] <+Pendragwn> @tiger_guard it's like they finally gave up trying to make sense and were like hey what if we gave ada an awesome ass
[2:33:42] <$joylent_blue> lmao Sherry
[2:33:43] <chhdez> Warframing
[2:33:49] <ape_hawk> hey, when did this game get zombies?
[2:33:50] <natebud> Oh no, he became lame
[2:33:56] <BalloniWright> PogChamp
[2:33:57] <biomegabear> MINI KRAUSERS
[2:33:57] <%SirGO0SE> thats not his leg Kreygasm
[2:33:59] <%Shadicara> Pat leave sherry alone
[2:34:00] <Lockpickgamer> Have you tried melee? its brokenly OP
[2:34:00] <+Grayhammatter> only the leg though
[2:34:03] <%cervidaequus> Dunk on em jake
[2:34:05] <%Laecerelius> climb more?
[2:34:09] <sexdrugsvideogames> music is so dramatic
[2:34:09] <%YakumoYomi> There's no way that Ada's campaign is worse than Jake. It's shorter, designed for a single player, and is less obnoxious that this one.
[2:34:09] <wrydiculous> climb more
[2:34:14] <rytisone> what if you shot them in the dick?
[2:34:15] <%Lizard0TM> shoot up while on your back?
[2:34:15] <Hellarussian> Sherry say " haha i fart, Jake"
[2:34:16] <Neo_Kaiser> There's a place you can climb up on the opposite side
[2:34:20] <%Shadicara> LUL
[2:34:22] <$joylent_blue> do more suplexes
[2:34:23] <ALTRNico> Pat a smelly player confirmed
[2:34:23] <WonkierMk2> punch helicopter
[2:34:26] <Neo_Kaiser> Doing so gives you a chopper QTE to instantly kill it
[2:34:31] <ShichiNoBushi> He hates Melee players.
[2:34:31] <CloniiCory> @Pendragwn In fairness. Capcoms first response to anything is to give something a great ass. Those homies are all Ass men.
[2:34:35] <%mrjplays2k9> HEY
[2:34:37] <boomstickery> oh god those thigns look dumb
[2:34:37] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> She's fiiiiine

[2:38:05] <%AnacondaVirtue> You were right. Pat. Wesker(s) CAN teleport.
[2:38:06] <Explodincatz> I guess the argument is solved on if its speed or teleportation
[2:38:07] <wrydiculous> Because what the game expects you to do is to just shoot the chopper down with grenades

[2:42:52] <thebladeshield> @patstaresat Dick Energy Music

[2:42:54] <%krawtch> Jake climbs a rope up to a helicopter before teleporting back to the ground safely. Can't climb an 8 foot gate
[2:42:55] <%mikesapartment> it's when horde mode was invented
[2:42:55] <%Nobrev> nah
[2:42:55] <Joestar1890> Maaaaybe?
[2:42:56] <%Typhaeon> I would even take the bad old Atari days to be honest
[2:42:56] <%SirGO0SE> nah probably the 1970s
[2:42:56] <EuropanLamprey> Video Games almost died in the 80s man
[2:42:57] <%spiritofmojave> Well it did give us Nier so sorta
[2:42:57] <%D00msDayDan> it all went downhill after cod4
[2:42:57] <Lionkevinson> No
[2:42:58] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> 1870s was pretty bad
[2:42:58] <%Chichen> but dark souls tho
[2:42:58] <Mister_McDerp> early 360 yes
[2:42:59] <jjetfuel> perhaps
[2:43:00] <%Zerodyne90> yes
[2:43:00] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> @PatStaresAt but paying 500 dollars for Pong
[2:43:01] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt WII U also the same time
[2:43:01] <%xxshadowxx416> no
[2:43:01] <Neo_Kaiser> Why doesn't Jake just punch the door?
[2:43:01] <Galacta_Pieta> It wasn't the shittiest era but it flooded the era with shit, if that makes sense
[2:43:02] <Dutchpotato> It wasn‚Äôt the worst but it‚Äôs was pretty bad
[2:43:02] <Sunstalker> Hell no. That's when we got Dragons Dogma and other cool shit
[2:43:02] <DracaenaLeaf> Call of Duty ruined the trend
[2:43:02] <+LeiteroMasta> atari shovelware era was worst
[2:43:03] <%ammobasket> NES era tho
[2:43:04] <Oxybe> 80s
[2:43:05] <%Marpolo13> for RE? maybe. in general? na
[2:43:06] <natebud> Someone should rank the generations
[2:43:06] <%Frost_Quill> DS2 literally had a knee-high wall block your progress.
[2:43:06] <+nekodelic> fuck no, but it had the worst new trends
[2:43:06] <tiger_guard> he can do all that
[2:43:07] <%ssjklyco> First half was great
[2:43:07] <+SundanceShot> the artari and shit were way worse
[2:43:07] <wrydiculous> oh yea, it was an era of jank
[2:43:07] <%mak0t0yukii> No
[2:43:07] <SchroedingersFerret> Music's like someone heard Verese once while blackout drunk and tried to remember what they heard.
[2:43:08] <%vectorless_peon> id say before nintendo was still the worst
[2:43:08] <IndoorSitup> Not as bad as the 70s
[2:43:08] <tolloponik> the current era is send it a run for its money
[2:43:08] <%alexandrecau> atari days were worse and you hate gameboy
[2:43:09] <yourliteraldog> it was harbinger of shit tbh
[2:43:09] <+Toblo1> It has its gems, but it also had it's Big Stinkers
[2:43:10] <+Sp3ctre48> LUL
[2:43:10] <ALTRNico> souls like games are terrible btw
[2:43:11] <Mister_McDerp> true
[2:43:11] <%machshop> 2007-2010 was kinda shit
[2:43:12] <sexdrugsvideogames> qte are from dreamcast
[2:43:12] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[2:43:12] <%corepercentlives> hmm
[2:43:12] <dukenux> it was peak "dumbing down"
[2:43:13] <tiger_guard> but not climb over
[2:43:13] <alwayspronking> Idk, how do we classify shittyness
[2:43:14] <Dragon_Batman> Like in terms of general ideas being practiced yea, but there is some good stuff
[2:43:15] <wrydiculous> YES
[2:43:15] <OldOnyx> post 90s sure
[2:43:15] <Kraidn> @PatStaresAt Don't forget the dev kits that spawned Android games LUL
[2:43:16] <%asgard147> limesLUL
[2:43:17] <Plague_bagel> he just fucking jumped
[2:43:17] <Oxybe> pre-NES 80'S
[2:43:17] <natebud> MW2
[2:43:17] <ape_hawk> no, it did
[2:43:17] <$Chimeraelite> HEY MW2 is great
[2:43:18] <+gruff_gridof> japan struggled
[2:43:18] <xxmagonx> LUL
[2:43:19] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[2:43:20] <Ashenik1> Pat well Dark Souls though
[2:43:20] <EuropanLamprey> It all went downhill after Pong
[2:43:21] <GeltonZ> 2006 was a MASSIVE shift in the industry and I hated it.
[2:43:21] <bsmusic> ET was the worst era
[2:43:21] <Tucker0603> @patstaresat but Pat. Dragon's dogma
[2:43:22] <Morsuzado> remember the ps1 era when people didn't understand how movement and cameras should work in 3d?
[2:43:23] <%shadow1man9> @PatStaresAt Video Game Crash happened so no
[2:43:23] <rytisone> after RE4
[2:43:25] <tiaramaki> Modern Warfare 1 and 2 were pertty good
[2:43:28] <Joestar1890> I like MW2 and Blops 1
[2:43:28] <jjetfuel> in that era japanese companies weren't really making good games
[2:43:29] <%Typhaeon> years and years of shitty PC ports
[2:43:29] <munchkay> it was over saturated with terrible design choices
[2:43:29] <Mister_McDerp> yes it was
[2:43:29] <tiaramaki> *pretty
[2:43:31] <biomegabear> NO
[2:43:31] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> yes, fam twas
[2:43:31] <+Mumbles519> it's great
[2:43:32] <%Marpolo13> it was
[2:43:32] <%bubblebasspickles> FAM BAE
[2:43:33] <rcand9> lit af
[2:43:34] <+arancet> yeah but it was a bad influence
[2:43:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> lit before lit was a thing?
[2:43:35] <IndoorSitup> Wasnt as bad as the 70s was
[2:43:35] <%YakumoYomi> All the big devs tried to ape COD, and most did it BADLY
[2:43:35] <karl_rex> Halo Reach was pretty good
[2:43:36] <Joestar1890> and World at War
[2:43:38] <Neo_Kaiser> Ok Boomer
[2:43:38] <dukenux> it was good
[2:43:39] <Reizie_Etherealm> Modern warfare 2 is the shit
[2:43:39] <%cervidaequus> Is this the same hole where leon campaign started?
[2:43:40] <Oxybe> @patstaresat Pre-NES 80's was worst
[2:43:40] <Finaldragoon> he says as he sips Monster energy
[2:43:40] <SaltyAzteca> The first stage in COD4 Kreygasm
[2:43:41] <+Slice_of_Kris> that sniper section sucks fucking massive balls
[2:43:41] <%D00msDayDan> and then every game wanted to be cod4 but worse
[2:43:41] <SMuffinMan> It was SO good
[2:43:41] <KeystoneA1> I made guides on it. It was the shit.
[2:43:42] <%krawtch> Resistance and Killzone were cyanide and arsenic to the shooter genre
[2:43:42] <%PerrinIsDead> Some of my fav games came out in the 360 era
[2:43:42] <CloniiCory> Nah adds up. COD4 came out after Halo 3. I agree with this statement.
[2:43:42] <%Huntercd> Demon's Souls tho
[2:43:42] <+Therealskie> it being good was the problem.
[2:43:42] <Hellarussian> sick
[2:43:43] <natebud> back when map packs were free, the good old days
[2:43:43] <ape_hawk> COD4 WAS TOO GOOD, IT RUINED EVERYTHING
[2:43:43] <%Zerodyne90> it was alright
[2:43:44] <WarchiefGoldva> @PatStaresAt That's the one thing that boils my piss in Nioh. You have a giant sword but a flimsy little door bars your passage to a shortcut.
[2:43:47] <%Marpolo13> halo 3 really was my jam for a long time tho
[2:43:47] <%Simketh> Yes, all of the "AAA" titles were way too ambitious for the platform hence why their current gen remasters are the best versions
[2:43:48] <%Laecerelius> LEON IS SUCH A HERO
[2:43:48] <+Grayhammatter> oh good, fart monster
[2:43:48] <%SirGO0SE> modern warfare fucked
[2:43:48] <%michingmallecho> It‚Äôs about family Jake
[2:43:48] <NotTheCoronaVirus> TOM HANKS BibleThump
[2:43:48] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> yup leon did that
[2:43:49] <malletman241> cod went to shit after 2
[2:43:50] <%heartlesshealer> teleporting grabs
[2:43:51] <%Ner234> Damnit Leon LUL
[2:43:52] <%sizzlepug> ps3 and 360 is like someone fell on their face but it wasnt funny, it was just annoying
[2:43:52] <%optimasmaximas> @alwayspronking by whether or not the screen ACTUALLY looks like it has shit smeared on it from the color of the game
[2:43:53] <+Exicuren> THIS FUCKING SECUENCE IS THE FUCKING WORST, I FUCKING HATE THIS PART
[2:43:53] <%Pappajimbo> not the 80s crash bad but pretty shit
[2:43:54] <jijipose> Pat, this whole game sucks ass
[2:43:56] <jorniev> every game became call of duty after mw
[2:43:56] <SMuffinMan> Vacant best map
[2:43:56] <%peachy996> File in everybody
[2:44:00] <Reizie_Etherealm> I'm grateful for the Xbox 360 only for Tenchu Z
[2:44:00] <rcand9> this section gets worse ever few steps
[2:44:02] <%corepercentlives> copy the successful game era
[2:44:08] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> but you gotta have a stepping stone to get to RE2, DMC5, God of War, etc
[2:44:08] <+plus_on_black> I stop playing games from 2004 to 2012.
[2:44:10] <%PerrinIsDead> Dead Space, Mass Effect, Skyrim, Dark Souls/Demons Souls,
[2:44:13] <dukenux> CoD4 was too good, and spawned too many copycats
[2:44:13] <+FrontLineFluffyBunny> it also didn't help that that console generation lasted 10 fucking years
[2:44:13] <ape_hawk> are we at least done wiht half the game?
[2:44:14] <%Typhaeon> hmmmmm
[2:44:15] <IndoorSitup> I'd say MW2 is when it atarted going downhill
[2:44:15] <%Simketh> Last of Us ran like dogshit on a PS3
[2:44:17] <Morsuzado> remember nes schlock days that resulted in landfills of unsold games?
[2:44:18] <%logoth_> Now every game is a battle royale. OH BOY
[2:44:21] <snekUrgentPls> ask Leon
[2:44:24] <%ssjklyco> I remembered Arkham Origins had batman trapped at the beginning, yet his explosive gel could have blown through the regular ass fence, but because VIDEO GAME, you have to solve a puzzle.
[2:44:27] <karl_rex> Is that Leon's plane enemy?
[2:44:27] <%trustycoyote> I'm picky about FPS but even MW2 hooked me
[2:44:28] <natebud> Leon killed all these people
[2:44:28] <%Laecerelius> Dammit Leon
[2:44:28] <%StaceMcGate> ANGRY HORNS
[2:44:30] <Neo_Kaiser> Last of Us is dog shit, yes.
[2:44:30] <%PerrinIsDead> A fuck ton of amazing games came out in the 360 era
[2:44:30] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I think they should bring back the body tripping
[2:44:32] <munchkay> it's the fuking monster form the plane!
[2:44:32] <%GarbageNirvana> We got Bayonetta in '09
[2:44:33] <%michingmallecho> 360 had such a high failure rate. The reason it succeeded was because it was first and the ps3 was such a bitch to actually code for
[2:44:33] <+Toblo1> OH. Is that the one that Leon dropped?
[2:44:34] <%GarbageNirvana> So I meean
[2:44:34] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @ape_hawk Yup. About 60% done I think.
[2:44:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> NES is the baby days of the game industry
[2:44:37] <Hellarussian> kick
[2:44:37] <SilverFaustX> tom hanks got corona virus
[2:44:40] <anAngryHamster> Every time they say Edonia I think they're saying Ethiopia
[2:44:40] <Dragon_Batman> It looks like it landed smushed and farted all the gas
[2:44:40] <illTemperedSeaBass> I think there were two things that happened: the first was that Eastern (Japanese) companies started failtastically catering to western audiences, and the Western AAA companies full heel-turned.
[2:44:42] <%AnacondaVirtue> Why is it SO low-poly
[2:44:43] <IndoorSitup> MW2 was the beginning of the doenward spiral
[2:44:46] <+Lost_Echo> 360/PS3 era was the death of Middle-Budget/AA games and it was all AAA big budget games for most of the generation
[2:44:46] <+xBolts4Lifex> LUL
[2:44:48] <%CalderGaming> none of the games from the ps3/360 era were so bad the unwanted copies got dumped into a dedicated PIT
[2:44:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> Xbox is the awkward tenage years
[2:44:48] <rytisone> you feel tension with this music?
[2:44:48] <srkAres> LUL
[2:44:50] <+Grayhammatter> this music is so generic
[2:44:50] <waifoong98> LUL

[2:44:50] <%Maids4lyfe> @Morsuzado that was Atari before the NES was ever a thing

[2:44:54] <%Ner234> Walk it off
[2:44:55] <wrydiculous> LUL
[2:44:56] <CloniiCory> @ssjklyco Asylum and City hold up pretty well. Origins and Knight are dog shit.
[2:44:57] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat, don't blame the 360 era for EAs choices.
[2:44:57] <dukenux> SHERRY
[2:44:59] <%peachy996> So is Tom sick or is he infected
[2:45:00] <tiaramaki> She'll be fine

[2:45:36] <%peachy996> @StaceMcGate Yeah but is he currently in the hospital or what
[2:45:36] <%Typhaeon> You go from M117 Bear Terminator to... Shotgun
[2:45:37] <%DarkestDawn64> It's just called "Shotgun?"
[2:45:38] <yoshkosh20> leaving your co-op partner to die in any game is hilarious
[2:45:38] <Explodincatz> he fell
[2:45:39] <jorniev> how many chapters to go?
[2:45:39] <%PerrinIsDead> Arkham Asylum and City, AssCreed 1-Brotherhood, Mirrors Edge, Deus Ed come on guys you could list hundreds

[2:45:50] <wrydiculous> Black Ops 1 was sick
[2:45:50] <tiaramaki> GOT HIM
[2:45:52] <jorniev> black ops was fun
[2:45:53] <%Lizard0TM> Black Ops 2 had the BEST multiplayer
[2:45:53] <SMuffinMan> Vacant best COD4 map!
[2:45:54] <%InugamiTheHound> Black ops is best COD game don't @ me!

[2:45:56] <danknugglit> Annnd thats it
[2:45:57] <yourliteraldog> call of duty black cocks
[2:45:57] <rytisone> people started complaining since MW3
[2:45:57] <+Exicuren> And then everyone started to copy COD
[2:45:58] <%PerrinIsDead> Black Ops 1 had a great campaign
[2:45:58] <IndoorSitup> N U M B E R A
[2:45:59] <%krawtch> blops 1 on PC at launch was like buying a $70 beta
[2:46:00] <Neo_Kaiser> CoD4 was cash money
[2:46:01] <biomegabear> CHAT WTF
[2:46:02] <+FrontLineFluffyBunny> CoD was never the problem, it was stupid execs trying to cash in on the trend
[2:46:02] <%xxshadowxx416> ha;o 3
[2:46:03] <Joestar1890> Persona 4 and Persona 4 Golden
[2:46:04] <StarlitStunner> World at War
[2:46:05] <jjetfuel> black ops was raw
[2:46:07] <IndoorSitup> N U M B E R S
[2:46:07] <Coystick> You gonna stream COD Warefare Chicken Dinner manpai>
[2:46:08] <DatAsuna> @Lizard0TM it also had some of the best hidden branching choices in a campaign
[2:46:11] <%Zerodyne90> CoD HahaNutcracker
[2:46:11] <Zebroneath> RE6 would have truely been the CoD killer in the eyes of Capcom. LUL
[2:46:12] <tiger_guard> yeah MW1 and 2 and Black ops 1 was what made me play cod and world at war
[2:46:15] <%Marpolo13> WaW tho
[2:46:15] <nademonkey1100> world at war was great but everyone forgets about it
[2:46:19] <%PerrinIsDead> THE NUMBERS MASON
[2:46:20] <Neo_Kaiser> MW2 sucks!
[2:46:20] <ABakedDemon> halo 3 though
[2:46:21] <$autcetera> See, I got into CoD during the last days of MW2 when every match was hacked on 360. Blops 1 and 2 were my real introduction to the series, and Wager Match was the BEST OH MY GOD
[2:46:23] <%xxshadowxx416> halo reach
[2:46:24] <jorniev> REMEMBER THE CALL OF DUTY DAWG... HIS MOUTH OPENS !
[2:46:25] <%heartlesshealer> I like how none of those melee executions ever break the guns
[2:46:29] <dukenux> "wanting CoD audience" was the problem
[2:46:29] <%Marpolo13> @nademonkey1100 ayyyy
[2:46:30] <Joestar1890> Was ODST good?
[2:46:31] <Neo_Kaiser> MW2 didn't even have servers!
[2:46:34] <Dragon_Batman> That'd be nice
[2:46:35] <%peachy996> THAT'S A Dinosaur
[2:46:35] <natebud> Nah that'd be dumb
[2:46:36] <%InugamiTheHound> halo 3 vs COD 4 everyday after school
[2:46:36] <SaltyAzteca> I blame DBZ for that
[2:46:37] <%cervidaequus> No stunning allowed
[2:46:38] <wrydiculous> You can destroy the cocoons actually
[2:46:39] <%PerrinIsDead> Did anyone play the World At War PS2 version because they were too broke to have a 360?
[2:46:39] <Neo_Kaiser> ODST is good
[2:46:40] <%heartlesshealer> Sherry can kill them in coccoon form
[2:46:41] <%Aracon_> it doesn't make sense why you can't just preemptively kill them
[2:46:42] <Neo_Kaiser> Go play ODST
[2:46:43] <%xxshadowxx416> gears of war 1 and 2
[2:46:45] <Graxe_> You can destroy the cocoons, it just takes a bit
[2:46:45] <yourliteraldog> That would be good game design
[2:46:46] <sexdrugsvideogames> invincibility frames
[2:46:47] <+gibbetterinternet> you can melee them to break the cocoons
[2:46:48] <ABakedDemon> odst is great
[2:46:48] <GeltonZ> @PerrinIsDead Thing is I didn't like any of those. My favorite games of the generation were Sin & Punishment: Star Successor and We Cheer 2 and Saints Row 2.

[2:53:24] <%krawtch> thats the first mention of him

[2:54:40] <%vectorless_peon> yes
[2:54:40] <%NeroInfinite> Didn't we kill him with a drilll?
[2:54:42] <%Aracon_> he couldn't be more lame
[2:54:44] <Joestar1890> Euro Nemesis
[2:54:44] <+StoicMoogle> Is this supposed to be written as an anime?
[2:54:44] <Tucker0603> the arm is fucking rad
[2:54:46] <%StrawberryPantsu> BUT YOU PUNCH HIM
[2:54:46] <Plague_bagel> i love how the always just point guns at the unkilliable bio weapons
[2:54:47] <Amasepyt> This game is genuinely incomprehensible
[2:54:48] <%Jekado> but he has dumb claw
[2:54:51] <conflict1914> its a good thing he got rid of his insta-kill drill

[2:55:03] <%logoth_> Ustinak looks like a fucking killing floor enemy
[2:55:04] <+Grayhammatter> he's like extremely low budget nemesis
[2:55:04] <%MrBorisMakarov> it's fine
[2:55:07] <%ssjklyco> It was Billy Coen the whole time
[2:55:07] <%D3rrtyD4n> thats what i was thinking
[2:55:08] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Yeah, that was cool
[2:55:09] <%iHum4n> Ustanak is just Kanatsu backwards
[2:55:09] <%Aracon_> he's self conscious
[2:55:10] <natebud> he decided he can see today without bugs too
[2:55:11] <%krawtch> that looked great, sprinting into a wall.
[2:55:12] <%Shadicara> If you want to make nemesis cooler just give him two mini guns
[2:55:12] <„Éè„ÇØ„Ç¢> he's just a dumber looking master blaster
[2:55:13] <%AncelDeLambert> wait WHAT
[2:55:13] <+FrontLineFluffyBunny> hes shy
[2:55:14] <Hellarussian> k bye
[2:55:15] <%Marpolo13> nope
[2:55:16] <%StrawberryPantsu> YOU DONT UNDERSTAND YOU GET TO PUNCH HIM
[2:55:17] <%TheMattman1313> It's been 6 months

[2:55:20] <%krawtch> RED TUM TUMS
[2:55:24] <%mighty_max_t> Did you know Ustinak backwards is Kanitsu?
[2:55:24] <wrydiculous> Ustanak is just a big burlap sack with anger issues
[2:55:24] <%NeroInfinite> He can also see without the bugs
[2:55:25] <%XeroSigmaPrime> USTANAK IS BETTER THAN NEMESIS, CHANGE MY MIND
[2:55:26] <Graxe_> He had six months to heal up
[2:55:27] <Captain_Krunk> @PatStaresAt Don't you fucking judge him! He's shy! K?! DansGame
[2:55:28] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Sore Tum-tums
[2:55:28] <WarchiefGoldva> He wishes he was nearly as cool as MrX.
[2:55:28] <%toolofparanoia> Jake needs to come back. We need a good version of Wesker now that we basically have a PMC Umbrella that's counter bioterrorism
[2:55:28] <waifoong98> nobody cared until he put it back on Kappa
[2:55:29] <Bustahhwulf> fada put his mask back on
[2:55:29] <nademonkey1100> @logoth_ he is literally just the scrake
[2:55:31] <rcand9> he needs the mask like kylo ren
[2:55:33] <+Delenay> leon just does it himself
[2:55:34] <ABakedDemon> been 6 months
[2:55:34] <%D3rrtyD4n> i figured face reveal would be towards the end
[2:55:35] <%Literal___Nobody> Why do I feel like Nemesis would be 100% more effective than Ustanak
[2:55:35] <%AncelDeLambert> how do you fuck up this most basic of narrative principles?!
[2:55:37] <%Tieliva> ustinak looks like a high tier normal enemy from killing floor but he's being treated as nemesis adjacent instead of just a big normal enemy
[2:55:38] <%Bane_Kaikyo> That was so nothing
[2:55:40] <%michingmallecho> My tum tum
[2:55:43] <%cervidaequus> Leeeon

[2:55:46] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Why can you go over this fence but not the door earlier
[2:55:48] <%YakumoYomi> @ssjklyco "You thought it was Billy...but it was I, STEVE!"
[2:55:48] <wrydiculous> He just tough it out
[2:55:51] <natebud> He's really good at his job
[2:55:54] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> max res
[2:55:57] <wrydiculous> a far cry from nemesis
[2:55:57] <ExpressNode> But he tough as fuck tho
[2:55:58] <Jack_DT> NEMESIS
[2:56:01] <SilverFaustX> nba and nhl getting canceled
[2:56:01] <iosephe> he's just big and strong
[2:56:02] <+conradical> just clip into those boxes
[2:56:03] <Dragon_Batman> That wound still persists, they didn't even patch him up
[2:56:03] <$Chimeraelite> The HATE keeps him going

[3:22:28] <Monkeyweed21> Who built this

[3:22:35] <%TIME_PUNCHER> COLLECTABLE
[3:22:39] <Reizie_Etherealm> This whole game is just Capcom winging it from top to bottom
[3:22:41] <Lord_of_all_Edges> are those big blue circle things collectables?

[3:23:00] <%Dhurkst> The grunge & lighting reminds me of Fallout 3
[3:23:03] <%AncelDeLambert> gee, if only this Resident Evil game had a map. Too bad, though, no other RE game ever had one, so this one can't. Tradition, y'know?
[3:23:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> the writers didn't think about anything
[3:23:03] <$autcetera> @yoshkosh20 Ganondorf was weakened by cutscenes back in WW :p

[3:26:07] <holsety5> Its really cool. Its a shame that its a bad game
[3:26:08] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt So E3 is dead, but the much bigger thing is that the NBA just suspended the rest of the season, March Madness is going to have zero people in the stands, and the MLB is likely to cancel its season as well
[3:26:09] <%TheBitingIrish> These monsters are weak AF tho, so...
[3:26:10] <KaseKaizer> turn on invasions coward

[3:32:18] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt Show some respect that is the same stuff that killed his dad
[3:32:20] <Ashenik1> Is now Mr Plinkett playing?
[3:32:22] <nerdypanda> snitchClown

[3:32:26] <DracaenaLeaf> MGS4
[3:32:26] <jorniev> oooooho THIS PART
[3:32:26] <CritterPatter> I love how jank these crawling parts are.
[3:32:27] <s1rcuit> remember that time Pat fought those dudes on that boat shipping lava?
[3:32:31] <+ZephynM> They sure don't crawl very fast.
[3:32:31] <natebud> Jake fears lava just like his dad
[3:32:32] <EvanAlmighty210> for a dumb action game, this is a REAL dumb action game
[3:32:33] <%Aracon_> this is RIDICULOUS
[3:32:33] <ha2ken> This looks like some stupid BS.
[3:32:34] <%KishinGrek> At least no self destruct?
[3:32:34] <%goose_attack_almanac> THIS IS TERMINATOR
[3:32:35] <Ralfclogs> jphFine
[3:32:35] <Mister_McDerp> yeah

[3:32:42] <ALTRNico> no shut up it's exciting
[3:32:43] <tiaramaki> OH NO IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MICROWAVE HALL THING?
[3:32:43] <Tombstonepiledrivr> THE GOOOOOOOOAAAAAAATTTT
[3:32:44] <Vordox> It's a Modern RE.
[3:32:44] <Dragon_Batman> And that started with Leon's campaign too
[3:32:44] <srkAres> nice clipping
[3:32:44] <hat_under_bread> Restraint isn't a word in their playbook.
[3:32:44] <%maskedriderhero> its the same issue with Uncharted
[3:32:46] <+Onyxdeus> Snake! You have to crawl through!
[3:32:47] <%Keyd00d> this sucks man
[3:32:47] <$Kenzo2000> This place is an OSHA nightmare
[3:32:47] <%peachy996> Yknow at least in Uncharted there were more breather levels
[3:32:47] <rcand9> every 5 seconds
[3:32:47] <%StaceMcGate> @QueequegTheater yeah it is, and then you get to the news and start freaking out. I was laughing two hours ago and now I'm getting sorta spooked
[3:32:48] <%ammobasket> This is DUMBBBBBBBBBBB
[3:32:48] <yourliteraldog> CRONCH
[3:32:49] <mankeytennis> Terminator
[3:32:50] <wrydiculous> Even RE5's temple run is way better than this
[3:32:52] <Plague_bagel> it just builds and builds and builds
[3:32:53] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:32:53] <Captain_Krunk> ResidentSleeper
[3:32:53] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt We're approaching Uncharted levels of death defiance.
[3:32:53] <+Grayhammatter> that clipping is BAD
[3:32:54] <yoshkosh20> more emotional than the microwave hallway
[3:32:55] <rytisone> you were almost a Jake and Sherry sandwich
[3:32:55] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[3:32:57] <%peachy996> It wasn't setpiece after setpiece
[3:32:58] <%ammobasket> o7
[3:33:00] <%ssjklyco> Going Down
[3:33:00] <jasnake> Great, you've broken the Lava spinners, now what will appease the lava god baby?
[3:33:01] <yourliteraldog> the fucking lighting lol
[3:33:01] <ExpressNode> She just reloads her gun casually
[3:33:02] <ha2ken> The lightning lava
[3:33:02] <ape_hawk> is this still the ship?
[3:33:02] <+Splatterfest> it just happened that way
[3:33:03] <AmericanaRed> üëç
[3:33:03] <%Dhurkst> @rcand9 It's basically just a flu, right? The mortality rate is a lot higher comparatively, but still super-low.
[3:33:03] <natebud> This lava reminds me of my dad
[3:33:03] <Ralfclogs> fayDerp jphFine fayDerp jphFine
[3:33:03] <$sniffy77> just like ur dad jake
[3:33:04] <%heartlesshealer> Remember when the worst was just a Lava Boat?
[3:33:04] <%InugamiTheHound> reload that pistol gurl!!!
[3:33:04] <%SolidusRex> I love how Sherry casually reloaded there and then
[3:33:06] <%goose_attack_almanac> Congratulations you just completed the Terminator 1 section of the game
[3:33:06] <Mister_McDerp> thanks lava
[3:33:06] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt Lava killed Jake's dad Pat, of course he is afraid of it
[3:33:08] <SilverFaustX> he teleported
[3:33:08] <s1rcuit> I heard a public domain creature noise
[3:33:09] <Reizie_Etherealm> Michael Bay wishes his directing was this good LUL
[3:33:11] <+conradical> why would they design a power system so easily destroyed
[3:33:12] <Fiend95> You can feel how much plot armor you have at all times
[3:33:13] <%Typhaeon> So how did that charge a battery
[3:33:18] <Neo_Kaiser> Don't insult Terminator 1 like that
[3:33:19] <RavenHellkite> they could have used the stairs but okay
[3:33:19] <%KishinGrek> brucegParry
[3:33:19] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL LUL LUL
[3:33:20] <CritterPatter> I love how deadpan the characters are after these insane scenes.
[3:33:21] <$joylent_blue> LUL
[3:33:21] <%Tieliva> and the base still works without its central support structure-
[3:33:22] <ha2ken> Cinder is down there cuz lava.
[3:33:22] <tiaramaki> OH HERE WE GO
[3:33:23] <bolero765> LUL
[3:33:23] <%Skelegroove> The reserve power is enough to destroy the building
[3:33:23] <Dragon_Batman> Speaking of dad killings
[3:33:25] <+jiggy_snipe> oh god this scene again
[3:33:25] <%wingblade7> RE6 is just a love letter to Michael Bay
[3:33:25] <Yummy_Nukes> WE DID IT???
[3:33:26] <tiaramaki> NotLikeThis
[3:33:26] <+Sp3ctre48> This scene NotLikeThis
[3:33:28] <+Havictos> No Dual RPG's to the face did
[3:33:29] <yoshkosh20> stairs are for losers
[3:33:31] <%Keyd00d> todite
[3:33:32] <+FrontLineFluffyBunny> building your base on an exposed lava chamber in the south pacific seems suspect
[3:33:33] <ha2ken> Todight
[3:33:34] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Jake inherited Wesker's weakness for lava I guess
[3:33:35] <Mister_McDerp> the Wesker bloodline is weak to lava
[3:33:38] <RavenHellkite> todite
[3:33:40] <AmericanaRed> OneHand CAN WE NOT
[3:33:40] <%KishinGrek> brucegJojo brucegJojo brucegJojo brucegJojo brucegJojo brucegJojo brucegJojo
[3:33:40] <natebud> Where Chris deflects a bullet with his face
[3:33:41] <%SolidusRex> Todiet
[3:33:42] <+Sp3ctre48> Why would you say that Chris
[3:33:42] <ALTRNico> uh oh monkaS
[3:33:42] <Graxe_> Jake just doesn't like Chris
[3:33:44] <yourliteraldog> wut
[3:33:45] <%bubblebasspickles> ???
[3:33:45] <%heartlesshealer> SO CHRIS JUST INSULTED HIM
[3:33:45] <asteroidblues25> This the end of game?
[3:33:48] <%Nemesis2098> WHY WOULD CHRIS SAY THAT
[3:33:48] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[3:33:49] <bolero765> criticalRoast
[3:33:50] <katocrimson> he know the thing
[3:33:51] <%Dementedpenguin> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[3:33:52] <rcand9> IM ANGRY
[3:33:53] <%vectorless_peon> YAH context which makes everything more absurd
[3:33:54] <tiaramaki> "I DON'T KNOW WHO MY DAD WAS, BUT I ANGRY AND WANNA SHOOT YOU NOW."
[3:33:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> why chris
[3:33:55] <Graxe_> So he threatens to shoot Chris because he doesn't like Chris
[3:33:55] <Fear_Ranjer> Chris why the fuck
[3:33:55] <%Ner234> MAD FOR NO REASON
[3:33:56] <+Sp3ctre48> WHY ARE YOU SAYING THIS
[3:33:56] <%SoFarFetched> BUT JAKE STILL GETS MAD EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW HIS DAD WAS A TERRORIST
[3:33:56] <%alexandrecau> I peed on his corpse
[3:33:57] <%spiritofmojave> WHY WOULD CHRIS CARE
[3:33:57] <$QueequegTheater> @StaceMcGate the thing is, even the CDC is saying that most people who have it will never realize it's anything more than a flu. But if someone is either elderly or immunocompromised like Paige, then THEY have a good reason to worry. But if you're healthy and young, you will almost certainly be fine
[3:33:59] <yourliteraldog> Why would you say that.
[3:34:00] <natebud> I killed him with a volcano
[3:34:00] <AmericanaRed> DBstyle ?
[3:34:01] <%StaceMcGate> WESKER DID NOTHING WRONG
[3:34:01] <karl_rex> What
[3:34:02] <%goose_attack_almanac> HOW IS THIS HOW YOU TALK TO PEOPLE
[3:34:02] <%za7az> Chris WANTS a fight
[3:34:02] <%Aracon_> this is the dumbest

[3:34:04] <Captain_Krunk> Not this again NotLikeThis
[3:34:04] <Mister_McDerp> WHY
[3:34:04] <%Typhaeon> Why would he even care
[3:34:05] <$QueequegTheater> WHY
[3:34:05] <Plague_bagel> its that teen angst
[3:34:06] <hat_under_bread> But you hate him though.
[3:34:06] <%xeros720> they just had to do this shit now
[3:34:06] <Fear_Ranjer> CHRIS why the FUCK
[3:34:06] <%peachy996> Music literally went Dun dun dun
[3:34:07] <waifoong98> what a bitch

[3:34:09] <%alexandrecau> this is dante and nero
[3:34:10] <+Grayhammatter> why?
[3:34:10] <%spiritofmojave> CHRIS WANTS TO DIE
[3:34:10] <Reizie_Etherealm> MY F-F-FATHERRR
[3:34:10] <+Havictos> Your dad was a tentacle monster in a volcano
[3:34:10] <Cybersoul666> YOU MURDERED MY DAD WHO I HATED!!! HOW DARE YOU CHRISSSSS
[3:34:11] <CritterPatter> Chris, I wouldn't use that as my introduction.
[3:34:12] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> You didn't even know him Jake
[3:34:12] <bashful_bard> Jake are you for real
[3:34:13] <%trevsded> TENSION AND DRAH MUH

[3:34:16] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 34m.
[3:34:16] <biomegabear> JUST TALK
[3:34:17] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Why would he care?
[3:34:17] <DracaenaLeaf> Friends > Family
[3:34:17] <%Meekest> Its Japan
[3:34:18] <%kewlmyc> WHY WOULD JAKE CARE!?
[3:34:18] <%heartlesshealer> family as blood is worthless
[3:34:18] <Mister_McDerp> DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HIS FATHER
[3:34:19] <%Frost_Quill> And Piers completely fails Chris here.
[3:34:19] <%Chichen> same

[3:34:21] <Clu_Flynn> Go to the elevator with Chris this time, new dialogue
[3:34:22] <Vordox> Best Gameplay, horrible story
[3:34:22] <%michingmallecho> JAKE YOU NEVER CARED
[3:34:22] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt right there with you
[3:34:23] <%Dhurkst> @QueequegTheater That's basically what I've heard too
[3:34:23] <lionandfox21> This is weird
[3:34:23] <Mister_McDerp> JAPAN
[3:34:23] <ha2ken> Family family family....
[3:34:24] <+jiggy_snipe> Jake didn't even know him LUL
[3:34:24] <nerdypanda> snitchCop snitchCop
[3:34:24] <%spiritofmojave> It's idiotic
[3:34:26] <%vectorless_peon> I'm mad you killed the dad i never knew
[3:34:27] <$Chimeraelite> Fuck blood.
[3:34:27] <+Caidezes> It's a Japan thing.
[3:34:27] <+Beerswithbears> i see your father in you. All jake knows about wesker is that he was a homicidal nut job... wtf
[3:34:28] <SMuffinMan> The context makes it WORSE!
[3:34:32] <ape_hawk> OR THEY ARE JESUS
[3:34:33] <$KnivesEve> tube babyy
[3:34:34] <%NeroInfinite> I was adopted out of the womb
[3:34:34] <Manmadeawesome> blood dont mean shit
[3:34:34] <eltigre1296> F A M I L Y
[3:34:34] <$Afterman_> it is blood, but it aint everythin
[3:34:36] <%Meekest> PAT. JAPAN
[3:34:36] <%ammobasket> Family HoNoR
[3:34:36] <Sol_Install> It's a Japan thing
[3:34:37] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Wasn't Jake just freaking out about how pissed he was that his dad was a super villain?
[3:34:37] <ToastedAeolo> Why would Jake even care? Did he know Wesker at all?
[3:34:38] <Mister_McDerp> FUCKING JAPAN
[3:34:39] <+Sp3ctre48> Well that's besides the point tbh, Jake literally has no reason to care about this
[3:34:39] <%michingmallecho> ITS ABOUT FAMILY DOM
[3:34:41] <%ssjklyco> There is no reason for Jake to be mad that Chris killed his dad, the person he just learned about a few months ago.
[3:34:41] <Reizie_Etherealm> F-F-FATHERRR
[3:34:41] <@commanderclaw> Remember Binary Domain?
[3:34:42] <Animorphimagi> Shut up Pat
[3:34:42] <+FrontLineFluffyBunny> but the power of friendship though
[3:34:43] <Coystick> THE BLOODLINE LEON
[3:34:44] <%cylish> Bloodlines are SUPER important in japan pat
[3:34:45] <EuropanLamprey> There's a thread on this subject on the subreddit right now
[3:34:45] <%SolidusRex> JAPAN
[3:34:45] <Speccu_> WESKERS SPERM IS TOO POWERFUL
[3:34:46] <Neo_Kaiser> What's that over there is that the script?
[3:34:46] <%StaceMcGate> @QueequegTheater I'm not worried about the disease, but work/school and how I'll be able to function. Also, if things shut down around me
[3:34:46] <+attackofthesage> Asian families heavily disagree Pat
[3:34:46] <Joestar1890> Japan's AAAAAAALLL about Blood relation
[3:34:46] <+Andrizzleton> yeah the family your born into could be complete shit
[3:34:47] <CritterPatter> Jake isn't even anything like Wesker.
[3:34:47] <%frankthetank285> if he even knew Wesker at all I wouldn't care but he found out 5 min ago
[3:34:48] <Bountiful_Ashes> WHO THE HELL ARE YOU TO TELL ME TO BE ALIVE????
[3:34:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> GROSS
[3:34:50] <$QueequegTheater> "Yes"
[3:34:50] <Plague_bagel> its japan
[3:34:50] <ha2ken> Sometimes it's worse when it's blood...
[3:34:50] <theloganbrand> both lul
[3:34:52] <AmericanaRed> unless you JOJO
[3:34:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> WHO THE FUCK CARES HE WAS A GLOBAL TERRORIST
[3:34:53] <%CrowbarFacelift> This is Kiryu's whole philosophy
[3:34:53] <%spiritofmojave> Also your blood family can be toxic fucks some cases
[3:34:54] <rcand9> we literally did this with chis and leon last campaign
[3:34:54] <%KishinGrek> Muh family... Family...Family...
[3:34:54] <Djinnazz> Why does Jake give a FUCK??
[3:34:54] <Blackjack760> Like Dio
[3:34:55] <Reizie_Etherealm> MARCUS, DOM, MARIAAA
[3:34:56] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt it's one of the reasons I hate Harry Potter
[3:34:57] <wrydiculous> BUT HE KILLED MUH PAPPY THO
[3:34:58] <%Keyd00d> You bear your family's sin in Japan
[3:34:59] <+buffn99> Everyone is related anyway :)
[3:34:59] <+Andrizzleton> b-but Japan blood
[3:34:59] <silverglove2012> I preordered this game. I remember playing it a good bit
[3:35:00] <%Nemesis2098> @PatStaresAt this is a sentiment old genertaions feel strongly, ask anyone's boomer parents
[3:35:01] <TraceBullet> RAAAAAAAAA
[3:35:01] <$Afterman_> only family blood that matters is Belmont.
[3:35:02] <OldDarkwraith> Jake - "REEEEEEEEE"
[3:35:02] <mrraindrop173> Chris can puch this guy to the ionosphere
[3:35:02] <yourliteraldog> Why dose he remind him Wesker was so evil.
[3:35:03] <+gibbetterinternet> family is important in japan culture :)
[3:35:03] <lionandfox21> WHO CARES WESKER ISN'T A GOOD PERSON ANYWAY
[3:35:03] <%peachy996> RAAAA
[3:35:04] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Just because they're family in general doesn't mean you give a fuck
[3:35:04] <waifoong98> rawrrrrrrrr
[3:35:04] <Captain_Krunk> @PatStaresAt It can set similar minor attributes. But they're basic at best. What you grow up with makes the bigger difference, and how you ingest it as you grow
[3:35:06] <%michingmallecho> THE REDFIELD BLOODLINE MUST LIVE
[3:35:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> everybody knows you're not a real person if you're adopted
[3:35:06] <Dragon_Batman> I can understand the annoyance of shit is at my door because of it but that is as far as it goes
[3:35:06] <SMuffinMan> Japan, Pat
[3:35:06] <nerdypanda> snitchS
[3:35:06] <antyriku2> does he not know wesker was an omega terrorist with super powers
[3:35:07] <%Aracon_> no but chris hurt me tho
[3:35:07] <rcand9> RAAAA
[3:35:07] <Neo_Kaiser> In Japan, blood is everything.
[3:35:08] <$lotharrio> Japan is weird about this sort of thing..
[3:35:08] <natebud> Chris has a strong face
[3:35:09] <ha2ken> No shut up tho cuz plot.
[3:35:11] <+Arizon1317> Father
[3:35:11] <Lord_of_all_Edges> "opps, I missed."
[3:35:11] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> RAAAAAAAAAAAAAWR
[3:35:11] <Aydarkzero> yeah Chris is deaf now
[3:35:11] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I hate a load of my family lol
[3:35:14] <+nathandiel> Pat brother issues
[3:35:14] <%Quikanims> jake i am now deaf
[3:35:15] <eltigre1296> I can call my family shit but you are not allowed to
[3:35:15] <+restivewolf> different for each person
[3:35:16] <SMuffinMan> Japan
[3:35:16] <Brigins> fuck all that. why the fuck is there fucking shaky cam in the fucking game!?! FUCK!
[3:35:16] <+spiegelspike> shouldn't the muzzle flash have blinded chris
[3:35:17] <%kewlmyc> Chris is deaf now
[3:35:17] <yoshkosh20> your dad was literally a terrorist
[3:35:17] <%SolidusRex> According to Japan, direct blood relationship also does WONDERS for romance
[3:35:18] <AmericanaRed> DEAFED
[3:35:18] <%Frost_Quill> The fact that Piers didn't shoot Jake here is bullshit.
[3:35:19] <%ammobasket> YES
[3:35:19] <%StaceMcGate> MUH FATHER
[3:35:19] <waifoong98> lameeeeeeeee
[3:35:20] <%Keyd00d> BUT PAT. SINS OF THE FATHER.
[3:35:20] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @PatStaresAt Don't worry about it
[3:35:21] <+Vayatan> and now chris is deaf
[3:35:22] <%theotherkristian> How much does Japan LOVE blood types?
[3:35:22] <TraceBullet> MAWP
[3:35:22] <jasnake> No, he's mad at Chris because Chris killed his dad, making Chris his new dad, and he was mad at his dad.
[3:35:22] <%valriot> Sounds like a dumb white American thing
[3:35:23] <rytisone> his ear is fine
[3:35:23] <illTemperedSeaBass> Nothing in or about this game makes sense.
[3:35:24] <Fear_Ranjer> I mean it's Japan so I'm not surprised blood relation is held to this regard
[3:35:24] <Yummy_Nukes> @patstaresat to be fair, my family is pretty badass
[3:35:25] <%TheMattman1313> Chris' eyes would've melted from the muzzle blast
[3:35:25] <+Andrizzleton> chris is deaf, canon
[3:35:25] <%michingmallecho> THIS CUTSCENE IS SO DUMB
[3:35:25] <augusta_wind> okay he‚Äôs deaf now
[3:35:25] <richmon_> chris cant hear shit now
[3:35:26] <%OToole42> chris was ready to just die
[3:35:26] <+conradical> good job piers
[3:35:27] <Neo_Kaiser> Japan LOVES blood
[3:35:27] <%Shadicara> No one cares jake not even you
[3:35:27] <bashful_bard> And they never met again
[3:35:28] <+canabananilism> *RIIIIIIIIIIING*
[3:35:30] <rcand9> the writers are dumb for even re writers
[3:35:30] <%Fenrirlives> @patstaresat I can see him being more mad at the fact that Wesker was never the father he wanted???
[3:35:32] <natebud> And now we know he is
[3:35:33] <+jiggy_snipe> Jake is an asshole
[3:35:34] <%Meekest> Then they never met again
[3:35:36] <SMuffinMan> It's Japan, Pat
[3:35:36] <Mister_McDerp> he is
[3:35:39] <nerdypanda> snitchU
[3:35:39] <%Aracon_> this scene is so fucking dumb
[3:35:39] <+Sp3ctre48> Yeah it makes more sense when you dont have context LUL
[3:35:40] <Reizie_Etherealm> A catagory G Akrid?
[3:35:42] <%spiritofmojave> Hey Jake your father was a crazy asshole, WHY DO YOU CARE
[3:35:42] <TCDerps> what's that smell?
[3:35:43] <$autcetera> Different cultural standards
[3:35:45] <%StaceMcGate> MY POOR WORM DEMON PAPA
[3:35:45] <mankeytennis> Sono Chi No Sadame Jaaaaaaake
[3:35:45] <%ssjklyco> Blood is thicker than water, but so is Maple Syrup
[3:35:46] <+ultimafullmetal> Piers probably didn't shoot him cause they need him alive.
[3:35:46] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> and he is, but, japan
[3:35:46] <Cybersoul666> Are you trying to tell me Jake isnt a total asshole?
[3:35:48] <%TheBitingIrish> AND THEN JAKE CEASED TO EXIST
[3:35:49] <%goose_attack_almanac> Can we also point out that Chris started this conversation going "I can see the guy who killed millions in you"
[3:35:49] <CloniiCory> Look at these Japanese tropes being stapled onto these American and Euopean fuckheads.
[3:35:50] <%Aracon_> oh god
[3:35:52] <$Afterman_> hay-aws
[3:35:53] <%heartlesshealer> blood is worthless
[3:35:53] <%ammobasket> o hey a bigger thing at stake
[3:35:54] <Mister_McDerp> C-HAOS
[3:35:55] <%Aracon_> their stupid banter

[3:35:58] <AmericanaRed> CHINA ABOUT TO BLOW UP
[3:35:59] <Brigins> stop with the shaky cam!
[3:35:59] <+prime_name> Chris's ear should be shot off
[3:36:00] <%Kirby_Sauce> Is Pat talking about Binary Domain again?
[3:36:00] <yoshkosh20> jake is literally the one who instigated that whole scene.
[3:36:00] <%Chichen> Does Sherry have the same VA as Ashley?
[3:36:00] <Xirn> monkaS
[3:36:01] <%peachy996> Maybe Jake will kiss Piers
[3:36:02] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Pierce is a tank too
[3:36:02] <%heartlesshealer> unless you're a quarter demon
[3:36:03] <%Keyd00d> COMPLETE GLOBAL SATURATION
[3:36:03] <iosephe> wow huh
[3:36:04] <waifoong98> COMPLETE GLOBAL SATURATION
[3:36:04] <+conradical> how lucky that that random chinese base had clothes in Sherry and Jake's sizes
[3:36:05] <%BlueMoonBlues> Why would that monitor be there?
[3:36:05] <%hermitsen> gotta manufacture drama between your superheroes somehow
[3:36:05] <wrydiculous> hang out with chris for different dialogue
[3:36:05] <+nekodelic> For people saying "Japan", historically the japanese culture is the complete opposite of this trope
[3:36:06] <ahaegotrigger> C VIRUS
[3:36:06] <%TheNewJapanGuy> CORONA-CHAN!
[3:36:07] <Tampaoster> Corona virus
[3:36:07] <Lord_of_all_Edges> lol they have pandora inc installed
[3:36:07] <+attackofthesage> I'd be cool with Chris having a total "Can't trust a Wesker" fit. Would be funny and solidifies Jake as his own character
[3:36:07] <%falineth> wow amazing simulation there
[3:36:09] <ha2ken> This is some Plague Inc BS
[3:36:09] <%EarleRiser> Jake fighting his programming to end the Redfield bloodline
[3:36:09] <CrimsonFox777> TOO LATE! EVERYONE'S INFECTED!
[3:36:10] <%DukeMoose> DukeMoose subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! AAAA i have to work around lots of people as a job. I cant just hunker down on my savings long enough AAAA

[3:36:11] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> the old god is ready
[3:36:12] <%Conyst> honestly I hate my family abd if someone told me they killed some of them I would only ask where they were buried so I could piss on their grave
[3:36:14] <eltigre1296> Corona averted
[3:36:14] <shurtal> Haos? Fuckin' really? Just add a c
[3:36:15] <wrydiculous> Hand out with chris
[3:36:15] <katocrimson> corona televised circa 2020
[3:36:16] <$QueequegTheater> @StaceMcGate Yeah, that's fair. My mom is running a business convention in the medical industry and people have started calling us demanding refunds because they're not coming despite the con not being cancelled at all ResidentSleeper
[3:36:16] <jorniev> HANG OUT WITH CHRIS
[3:36:16] <%Dhurkst> In a way, it's honestly kind of beautiful how much of a mess this game is.
[3:36:16] <Clu_Flynn> No Pat you'll get the same dialogue, dummy

[3:36:18] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Chris freaking out and pulling a gun on Jake makes 1000X more sense than the reverse
[3:36:19] <AfroKing24> pears BibleThump
[3:36:20] <$lotharrio> Reminder that it's a common trope in Japan that if you get a rad transhuman super body, it's a tragedy because you lost the body your parents gave oyu.

[3:36:35] <%Tieliva> @PatStaresAt i have a real question, how is haos supposed to infect things? it doesn't seem to exude any gas or infect any charactrs it's near
[3:36:36] <%SABiscotti> YEAH PIERS

[3:36:38] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[3:36:39] <yourliteraldog> fucking lol
[3:36:39] <wrydiculous> We already heard Pier's conversation
[3:36:40] <%ammobasket> with a capital t and that rhymes with p and that stands for pool
[3:36:42] <+xGreenflame> Team swap
[3:36:43] <Sammang> Isn't Chris voiced by sonic?
[3:36:44] <%Huntercd> This is the same plan as Weskers
[3:36:46] <AmericanaRed> VoHiYo
[3:36:48] <Reizie_Etherealm> The dialogue is different depending on who you go with
[3:36:51] <Captain_Krunk> There's trope after trope I see here, and it's fucking annoying. It only continuously made me cringe
[3:36:52] <%spiritofmojave> Can we just void Jake's campaign and have Piers
[3:36:52] <$QueequegTheater> "His name is JAKE WESKER"
[3:36:53] <AmericanaRed> BICH FOR REAL
[3:36:53] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> "I guessed"
[3:36:56] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> what a snitch leon
[3:36:59] <Clu_Flynn> Same dialogue as last time, great LUL
[3:36:59] <%maskedriderhero> Oh we got trouble! Right here in Resident Evil 6!

[3:37:00] <ABakedDemon> pat would fuck piers
[3:37:02] <Dragon_Batman> You've already heard it, you should have hung with chris
[3:37:03] <katocrimson> chris and leon are gossip girls

[3:37:16] <%spiritofmojave> LEON KNOWS JAKE EVEN LESS

[3:37:32] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> protect piers
[3:37:33] <%alexandrecau> like not recognizing your father's eyes in the mirror
[3:37:34] <%Nemesis2098> "Quick science man! Type on the computer FASTER"
[3:37:35] <CloniiCory> I like how Leons campaign is the least important of the 4.
[3:37:36] <CritterPatter> Piers is a cinnamon bun.
[3:37:37] <%mMayrro> it's the last thing Piers will do LUL
[3:37:37] <jasnake> Why are you killing all these innocent Kamen Riders?
[3:37:37] <Xirn> I unironically like Piers
[3:37:38] <Plague_bagel> shut up peirs
[3:37:41] <+Sp3ctre48> Shut up Piers you're gonna die in 10 minutes
[3:37:41] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Oh, Max is streaming
[3:37:42] <$QueequegTheater> I played a bit of Jake's campaign like 6 years ago
[3:37:43] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt You know what is more funny, you wouldn't see a zombie except in Leon's campaign
[3:37:44] <dukenux> LUL
[3:37:46] <Fear_Ranjer> THEN WHY SET HIM OFF
[3:37:50] <AfroKing24> i like pears too
[3:37:55] <yoshkosh20> what's scarier than bugs? bugs with guns.
[3:37:55] <nerdypanda> SabaPing
[3:37:56] <%Ner234> @ha2ken It's funny because there is a Hollow Knight mod that gives the you a gun. LUL
[3:37:58] <$QueequegTheater> WHY DO THEY HAVE GUNS THO
[3:37:59] <CritterPatter> Piers is my favorite in this game.
[3:37:59] <%ammobasket> Jake's been trying to set him off this whole time!
[3:38:00] <natebud> How did Leon run through all of China without seeing a single bugman?
[3:38:02] <ha2ken> Bugs are legion Pat.
[3:38:05] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> small amounts of many?
[3:38:06] <+Splatterfest> small amounts of many
[3:38:08] <Reizie_Etherealm> Small amounts of many tough enemies??
[3:38:08] <%spiritofmojave> I get angrier every second more Jake talks
[3:38:08] <$lotharrio> "Small amounts of many big tough?"
[3:38:10] <%goose_attack_almanac> Why are the basic virus enemies that Leon faces so much more durable
[3:38:12] <ha2ken> @Ner234 Shut up. That's great.
[3:38:13] <Lord_of_all_Edges> small amounts of big many
[3:38:14] <wrydiculous> small amount of many?

[3:38:18] <+Grayhammatter> i guess?

[3:38:23] <%afronooch> Leons seen enough Bugmen

[3:38:50] <Dragon_Batman> You said small amounts of big many enemies
[3:38:50] <TafferAA> can we just pretend it doesn't exist
[3:38:51] <DracaenaLeaf> Remove RE6 from canon basically
[3:38:51] <yoshkosh20> baby kick'em
[3:38:51] <natebud> Just make it dumber and worse
[3:38:52] <Mister_McDerp> RE6MAKE
[3:38:52] <wrydiculous> Normal amount then
[3:38:53] <Reizie_Etherealm> I'll take it
[3:38:53] <Captain_Krunk> No, please not
[3:38:53] <+FrontLineFluffyBunny> nah they should just pretend it never existed
[3:38:53] <biomegabear> THIS GAME NEEDS IT MORE THAT CVX
[3:38:54] <Xirn> I want RE8 with sheva and someone new
[3:38:54] <%theotherkristian> How
[3:38:56] <basementkingabe> Damn pat you Su
[3:38:56] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> good
[3:38:56] <Fear_Ranjer> RE6 Remake that's just Jake and Sherry with better story
[3:38:57] <ha2ken> @Ner234 Cool. Will check it out.
[3:38:58] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> gimme rebecca ove rjake
[3:38:58] <Sallieville> redo the whole story
[3:38:59] <katocrimson> remake more like reset
[3:38:59] <Grennold> Remake wouldn't save it. It's chronically fucked
[3:39:00] <%ssjklyco> Just make it in Classic RE 2 style
[3:39:00] <%Meekest> But Agent Birkin
[3:39:01] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Don't put this evil on us again
[3:39:01] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:39:02] <CritterPatter> Is this game canon?
[3:39:02] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> over*
[3:39:02] <King_thunder365> JUST MAKE A NEW RE6 AT THAT POINT
[3:39:03] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I think you're better off DMC2-ing it
[3:39:03] <kingbaconcrispy> Cohesive?
[3:39:03] <%asgard147> yeah sure
[3:39:03] <+Havictos> You what sure remake shitty games to make them not shitty
[3:39:04] <%shiplord13> At that point make a new game
[3:39:05] <%Pyroclase> Leon and Sherry teamed up
[3:39:05] <Explodincatz> REDO
[3:39:06] <rytisone> make it RTS
[3:39:07] <+PeopleOfTheLand> Leon was garbo in this.
[3:39:07] <%LaughingCatt> or a cool Sherry game
[3:39:08] <mankeytennis> Game need a reWRITE
[3:39:08] <yourliteraldog> Just make a Sherry game
[3:39:09] <%heartlesshealer> but Sherry
[3:39:09] <%Nemesis2098> Pair Leon with Jill
[3:39:10] <+BlockingDisabled> No, it needs a retcon
[3:39:11] <Captain_Krunk> Do we really need quantity over quality in a Resident Evil game?
[3:39:11] <%spiritofmojave> Just make the whole game about Sherry
[3:39:12] <@commanderclaw> Have Leon sploosh over Jake like Sherry
[3:39:12] <ha2ken> Bugmen are legion.
[3:39:13] <+Grayhammatter> Sherry campaign though
[3:39:13] <$Wafflum> This game needs to be ignored entirely and erased from canon
[3:39:13] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt that logic goes out the window with Haos
[3:39:13] <Manmadeawesome> It needs a REBOOT not a remake
[3:39:14] <srkAres> have like 1 chapter with another char each
[3:39:14] <+Splatterfest> nah RE8
[3:39:15] <%SirGO0SE> you just wanna kiss Leon but i dont blame you
[3:39:15] <+canabananilism> So just make a different game entirely
[3:39:15] <bashful_bard> Could you imagine if re7 had Jake Wesker as the antagonist
[3:39:15] <Zebroneath> Just erase it and make a new game
[3:39:15] <augusta_wind> just delete the entire game
[3:39:16] <+PeopleOfTheLand> Hell, Leon has been garbo since after RE2
[3:39:16] <%SolidusRex> Nah, Sherry solo game
[3:39:16] <+Karebuncle> one campaign that is Sherry and Leon
[3:39:17] <AmericanaRed> How Plague fix this one up
[3:39:17] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> make it all sheerry
[3:39:17] <+dosan121> re6 remake? PogChamp
[3:39:17] <%Keyd00d> This game cannot be saevd
[3:39:17] <%Aracon_> that would fix a lot
[3:39:17] <%heartlesshealer> YES
[3:39:18] <%StrawberryPantsu> Nah
[3:39:18] <natebud> yeyeyeye
[3:39:19] <%Simketh> This game might as well be on rails
[3:39:19] <%mMayrro> just make it sherry and helena
[3:39:20] <%peachy996> Kill Helena early
[3:39:20] <ABakedDemon> remake it by deleting it from existence
[3:39:20] <Mister_McDerp> YES
[3:39:20] <$velgaduere> makes sense
[3:39:20] <%arancet> everything cool? ...like what?
[3:39:20] <%cervidaequus> Leon fights 2 tanks and 2 choppers
[3:39:21] <%asgard147> YEYEYEYE
[3:39:21] <%StrawberryPantsu> Jake is cool
[3:39:22] <jorniev> im ok with a jake campaing
[3:39:22] <yourliteraldog> Yes
[3:39:22] <%Aracon_> THAT WOULD BE PERFECT
[3:39:23] <theloganbrand> Put Jake stuff in and make it that one RE7 dlc
[3:39:23] <%TheNewJapanGuy> No just ignore it
[3:39:23] <Plague_bagel> isnt that just 4 tho?
[3:39:23] <$QueequegTheater> ARA ARA LEON
[3:39:24] <%Fenrirlives> Nah Sherry should be MC
[3:39:24] <+HDmexiqtioner> Structure it like NeiR Automata honestly
[3:39:25] <%lyyyyraaaa> Leon A Sherry B
[3:39:25] <biomegabear> YEAH SHERRY GAME
[3:39:25] <bolero765> YES
[3:39:26] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Yeah, that'd work.
[3:39:27] <%EarleRiser> God I passed out for half an hour watching this
[3:39:27] <yoshkosh20> don't even remake it. just make a whole different 6
[3:39:28] <%trustycoyote> I'm down with that
[3:39:29] <WarchiefGoldva> Have Leon dye his hair white and have him find a cool sword.
[3:39:29] <%peachy996> Have Debruh eat her
[3:39:30] <starer_of_the_staring> Re5make, but set in Scandinavia instead.
[3:39:30] <AfroKing24> total overhaul
[3:39:31] <rcand9> 6 fails at being re and fails at attempting to be a competent action game
[3:39:31] <%AncelDeLambert> OH NO, BIGS
[3:39:31] <%alexandrecau> have sherry date all the boys
[3:39:32] <%xxshadowxx416> dmc 2 need a remake
[3:39:32] <%ssjklyco> Leon + Sherry: Lerry
[3:39:33] <AfroKing24> add jill
[3:39:34] <FutaSnek> PARASITE EVE
[3:39:34] <+Karebuncle> and SHerry has the C-Virus cure blood, no jake needed
[3:39:35] <Bustahhwulf> the sexual tension between leon and another blonde tho retroS
[3:39:36] <%Tieliva> so seriously how does haos infect things if it doesn't exude gas or anything like that?
[3:39:36] <Brigins> another big dumb thing. lets point our guns at it
[3:39:37] <Animorphimagi> Jake: fuck u fuck your family and fuck your sister
[3:39:37] <iosephe> ew
[3:39:37] <%spiritofmojave> Sherry, Leon, bring back Claire you cowards
[3:39:37] <%G_Thunders> Watching Leon chase Ada around isn‚Äôt fun though
[3:39:38] <jorniev> bring back billy
[3:39:39] <%Keyd00d> oh...
[3:39:39] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> not the Olive Garden

[3:47:37] <$QueequegTheater> cheer500 Considering this final boss is very literally a DMC 2 boss in Lucia's campaign, I wouldn't mind a mod to play through RE6 as Lucia. Can't be worse than this crap

[3:47:40] <%xxshadowxx416> that was cool
[3:47:40] <%krawtch> HOW IS SHERRY NOT IMMOLATED
[3:47:40] <%the_vedo_show> not dead atpCap
[3:47:40] <%hrudzie_1> HE WOULD BURST INTO FLAMES INSTANTLY
[3:47:41] <natebud> Thanks dad for teaching me the value of lava
[3:47:41] <mankeytennis> He should have his school desk
[3:47:41] <augusta_wind> and then he falls in too
[3:47:41] <maybefalco> he looks like he enjoyed the lava, nice hot bath
[3:47:41] <+FrontLineFluffyBunny> lave isn't hot water, it's incredibly dense
[3:47:41] <%Aracon_> so jake punch is greater than getting impaled, crushed, and falling out of a plane
[3:47:41] <Clu_Flynn> YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[3:47:42] <%Meekest> Jake shielding his face with his arm like thats not MOLTEN LAVA
[3:47:42] <xUmbraNinja> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[3:47:42] <wrydiculous> Yes, the liquidiest of lavas
[3:47:42] <tiaramaki> Now the guy puts a thumbs-up out of the lava... Kappa
[3:47:43] <Zebroneath> Why is the lava have water physics?
[3:47:44] <AfroKing24> guns and rockets didnt stagger him but punches do?
[3:47:44] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt Imagine if Wesker appeared and dragged him into the lava
[3:47:45] <Moonlit_Wisp> where was the rocket launcher kill
[3:47:45] <SwindlerOfProgress> Jake MUST be as strong as boulder-punching Chris

[3:47:49] <yoshkosh20> the crazy old man in 7 did it better
[3:47:49] <ShichiNoBushi> This game's winner is... JAKE!!
[3:47:50] <Clu_Flynn> Yeyeyeye
[3:47:50] <%vectorless_peon> Jake should be burned from that

[3:47:56] <ALTRNico> how?
[3:47:56] <CrimsonFox777> Honestly, the best part of that fight was him kicking the gun away.
[3:47:57] <rnyeeeezus> ?
[3:47:57] <Dragon_Batman> What?
[3:47:57] <Xirn> what? lava is lava?

[3:48:00] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> no shut up
[3:48:00] <%TroyMSW> No
[3:48:01] <%spiritofmojave> NO?
[3:48:02] <%Keyd00d> Just getting splashed with lava

[3:48:02] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt Stop asking perfectly reasonable questions
[3:48:02] <%optimasmaximas> REMINDER HE CANT HEAL
[3:48:02] <%cervidaequus> Whaaaaaaat

[3:48:03] <ALTRNico> IT'S LAVA
[3:48:04] <rcand9> pat
[3:48:04] <+linSP> lava is REALLY hot
[3:48:04] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> NO SHUT UP
[3:48:04] <tiaramaki> THAT LAVA SHOULD BE KILLING JAKE RIGHT NOW YIKES
[3:48:05] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt No, it's literally molten rock
[3:48:05] <dukenux> no
[3:48:05] <biomegabear> YEAH
[3:48:06] <%vectorless_peon> Jake should be VERY BADLY BURNED
[3:48:06] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> its a pretty chill lava
[3:48:07] <%ssjklyco> Healing
[3:48:07] <starer_of_the_staring> He's probably fine.
[3:48:07] <blue2red> power of the nova force
[3:48:07] <%AncelDeLambert> Lava is denser than the human body, you float
[3:48:08] <%Aracon_> lava is stronger than getting impaled, crushed or falling out of a plane
[3:48:08] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt Imagine Wesker grabbing him and pulling into the lava
[3:48:09] <+TossuDa> If only he punched him *angrily* earlier.
[3:48:09] <SchroedingersFerret> What is convection
[3:48:10] <%LaughingCatt> maybe its just painted gravel
[3:48:10] <Sunstalker> You don't fall into lava even. You bounce on it
[3:48:10] <+FrontLineFluffyBunny> they should be buring
[3:48:11] <Brigins> i cant wait for pat to be done with this. this game is bad for his health
[3:48:11] <EuropanLamprey> Idk, lava is pretty fucking damaging
[3:48:11] <%TomDanksEGOT> Master Blaster!
[3:48:11] <%Pyroclase> Convection currents aren't real pat, don't be silly
[3:48:12] <Yummy_Nukes> WHAT??? LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:48:12] <$lotharrio> Lava is stupidly hot. It's hotter than lightning- well, okay Pat brings up a good point.
[3:48:12] <natebud> Thanks dad for teaching me the value of lava
[3:48:13] <+Jasuchin> Convection? WHAT'S THAT!
[3:48:13] <AmericanaRed> EZ GG
[3:48:14] <%heartlesshealer> HEAT IS A MYTH, PAT
[3:48:15] <ShichiNoBushi> Convection?
[3:48:15] <Joestar1890> No shut up, Progenitor and G Virus tho
[3:48:16] <%mMayrro> pat if lava kills wesker it can kill everything
[3:48:16] <%TroyMSW> Nothing in this game makes sense. You're asking the game to make sense.
[3:48:16] <bolero765> convection isn't real tho LUL
[3:48:17] <CritterPatter> But the lava is more end game-y tho
[3:48:17] <conflict1914> DON'T YOU USE THE GAMES LOGIC PAT
[3:48:17] <jorniev> CHRIS DID IT
[3:48:17] <dukenux> Pat, molten metal is REALLY HOT
[3:48:17] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> theyre both mustants too ya hnow
[3:48:17] <Dragon_Batman> Excusing the heat dumbness shure but Lava is still lava
[3:48:18] <%Keyd00d> You would be dead before you got this close
[3:48:18] <Lord_of_all_Edges> No, see Jake has the high ground against the lava
[3:48:18] <%krawtch> that lava is just tepid. its like a hot bowl of soup.
[3:48:19] <$ShadowZiggy> Pat it's Lava
[3:48:19] <%Kirby_Sauce> anime logic Pat
[3:48:19] <%Dhurkst> @QueequegTheater could have sworn it was also in Dante's
[3:48:19] <s1rcuit> yeah the air would cook their lungs
[3:48:19] <+Delenay> how did she get up there?
[3:48:20] <wrydiculous> hmm
[3:48:21] <+Kduff89> RIGHT?
[3:48:21] <Reizie_Etherealm> Yes, the lava is only mildly warm and not searing hot
[3:48:22] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> I WAS GONE FOR FIVE MINUTES WHERE ARE WE
[3:48:22] <%the_vedo_show> HANDS BURNED OFF
[3:48:24] <%peachy996> thats one hot ladder
[3:48:25] <augusta_wind> it‚Äôs just warm slime
[3:48:25] <%MayorRev> Pat I dunno who first called you Boomer Brain but I'd like to echo that statement, boomer brain
[3:48:27] <$lotharrio> They should be cooked to death within seconds of the fight.
[3:48:27] <+ZephynM> How could this little boy punch out a giant bio-weapon beast like that in the first place?
[3:48:27] <%TomDanksEGOT> Master Blaster runs Lava Town!
[3:48:28] <tiaramaki> LLUL
[3:48:28] <natebud> And then he winks at Jake
[3:48:28] <j0ustar> Drill didn't pierce him BUT PUNCHES THOUGH
[3:48:28] <%cervidaequus> I will climb this metal ladder witb my hands
[3:48:29] <%theotherkristian> they're both regenerating freaks
[3:48:29] <RavenHellkite> if it's that dangerous they would have died just by being near the lava
[3:48:30] <chambatron> Time to shione
[3:48:30] <+Exicuren> NO SPOILS CHAT
[3:48:31] <tiaramaki> * LUL
[3:48:31] <%krawtch> you blow on it a little bit and its cooled down enough to stand on
[3:48:31] <%StrawberryPantsu> THEY'RE MUTANTS
[3:48:32] <%Keyd00d> Wesker lives in all lava
[3:48:32] <SilverFaustX> thats not lava its soup
[3:48:32] <rcand9> lava makes all the liquid explode out of you violently
[3:48:32] <StarvingPenguinGod> that ladder should be melting...
[3:48:32] <+Kduff89> HEAT STROKE RISK SO HARD
[3:48:32] <Joestar1890> "....Daddy?" - JAke
[3:48:32] <CrimsonFox777> Isn't lava super viscous and dense, so he'd just bounce or something?
[3:48:34] <%bread_assassin> What's convection?
[3:48:35] <Plague_bagel> and he gives a knowing nod to jake LUL
[3:48:35] <$QueequegTheater> @Dhurkst Might be. But Lucia's design fits RE a bit better
[3:48:36] <%DukeMoose> well DUH, its not lava, its molten lava and rock
[3:48:36] <lionandfox21> Yeah the "lava" is at least like 27 C or some shit if they're finw
[3:48:37] <AutechreTwinAphex> oh my god - this section is garbage too
[3:48:39] <dukenux> Room temp lava
[3:48:40] <wrydiculous> CHRIIIII-wait a minute
[3:48:43] <%theAncopro> father-son mudamuda
[3:48:43] <conflict1914> he's not dead is he
[3:48:43] <ha2ken> Then Wesker would need to go back down with the thumbs up thing.
[3:48:43] <%twistedj3ster> Jake reminds me of Trunks...a LOT
[3:48:45] <dukenux> Kappa
[3:48:45] <Captain_Krunk> @PatStaresAt They're super humans modified by the G virus, right? That's the excuse we can use here :)
[3:48:47] <%vectorless_peon> i like the idea that Wesker isnt dead he just lives in all laval now
[3:48:48] <%DontMindMee> but...but blue medal
[3:48:51] <%YakumoYomi> Video games never do lava "realistically". Instead of sinking, you'd just skid across the surface and burn to death
[3:48:51] <AmericanaRed> TOILET
[3:48:54] <AutechreTwinAphex> this is probably one of the worst levels of the game
[3:48:54] <Lord_of_all_Edges> so pat is protesting the collectables, got it
[3:48:55] <+kuervojones> Who builds a warehouse over a lava pit?
[3:48:55] <biomegabear> IS IT BAD I LIKE THE PUNCHING INTO THE LAVA?
[3:48:57] <Samaugsch2> It‚Äôs actually orange juice
[3:48:57] <+FrontLineFluffyBunny> an underwater helicopter!
[3:48:59] <dukenux> theyre called forklifts, Jake
[3:49:00] <%cervidaequus> Underwater time
[3:49:00] <+conradical> bossfight into shitty puzzle?
[3:49:03] <%TomDanksEGOT> all that metal would be glowing hot
[3:49:04] <King_Wolf_Rigger> SHERRY IS SUPER STRONG
[3:49:04] <+Vayatan> they should be dead from the heat upon entering the room
[3:49:04] <%krawtch> HOORAY THE LAST THING IN THE CAMPAIGN
[3:49:05] <MasterDecoder> @Exicuren All for spoils for this bad game
[3:49:06] <yourliteraldog> The Laws of Thermodynamics have been proven to be irrelevant in the RE Universe

[3:50:08] <goddamndavid> how could a cargo train even travel that fast and why?
[3:50:08] <%Nemesis2098> just throw boxes at it
[3:50:08] <srkAres> Sherry can :)
[3:50:09] <Malucoblz02> @PatStaresAt thats for cargo, not people

[3:50:18] <DracaenaLeaf> He's not this time lol
[3:50:18] <Monkeyweed21> HE HAS A NEW ROBO ARM
[3:50:19] <natebud> This game calls for calm consideration
[3:50:19] <Captain_Krunk> It's so jittery, the framerate is pixelated
[3:50:20] <%Shadicara> This is just bio broly
[3:50:21] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt neither of these two people are human though, so it works right now I guess.
[3:50:21] <%Lizard0TM> I can't see a thing
[3:50:21] <%ssjklyco> How did the lava explode though?
[3:50:22] <ha2ken> This is Pat we're talking about
[3:50:22] <%DedlokPM> BIDEO GARMES
[3:50:22] <Reizie_Etherealm> The moment you activate the train, the operator dies LUL
[3:50:22] <$KnivesEve> overreact harder
[3:50:23] <$QueequegTheater> @Havictos Imagine her in the RE Engine Kreygasm
[3:50:23] <CrimsonFox777> Just look at that synchronized crawling.
[3:50:23] <augusta_wind> you tell it Jake
[3:50:23] <%wingblade7> MOAR BOX
[3:50:23] <Maleicus> i mean why was the other platform fast enough to catch up
[3:50:23] <jorniev> HE IS NOT REACTING
[3:50:24] <%Nemesis2098> PAT JUST GIVE IT A HANCE
[3:50:25] <Zebroneath> This is too much. It's actually hurting my eyes.
[3:50:25] <+Kduff89> literally should have died a long time ago
[3:50:25] <+Sp3ctre48> Final boss is throwing boxes at the zombie man Keepo
[3:50:25] <theKingRamses> jake suplexed that thing not even a couple minutes ago
[3:50:26] <%Keyd00d> My fucking eyes
[3:50:27] <%heartlesshealer> How are their arms not flying apart?
[3:50:27] <%alexandrecau> give chances
[3:50:28] <dukenux> this is REALLY dumb
[3:50:28] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> That chat member works for Umbrella
[3:50:28] <+Delenay> these items werent on the cart when it started
[3:50:28] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Joe Baker would punch the enemy straight into hell
[3:50:29] <AutechreTwinAphex> why is this game so boring when shit happens nonstop?
[3:50:29] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> VIBEO GANE,
[3:50:29] <+DrSoulDraig> the game is over reacting
[3:50:29] <%mMayrro> youve been overreacting the whole game LUL just keep going
[3:50:30] <NotTheCoronaVirus> Just think NIOH 2 TOMORROW
[3:50:30] <%InugamiTheHound> the stream quality is kinda bad now or is it just the game?
[3:50:31] <%spiritofmojave> NOT ENOUGH overreacting
[3:50:31] <+Rolandknight> remember their mutants
[3:50:31] <+Delenay> it was flat and had nothing
[3:50:32] <+Buzzkill983> The crawling is so dumb
[3:50:33] <srkAres> also this is great for the encoding
[3:50:34] <Damie904> FYI Pat, compression's gone to shit for this sequence.
[3:50:34] <Slimeking_Mike> He's earned the riht to overreact
[3:50:35] <%the_vedo_show> atpCap atpCap atpCap
[3:50:35] <jorniev> HE IS BARELY FEELING AMOTION TOWARD THIS SHIT
[3:50:37] <natebud> slap slap
[3:50:39] <RavenHellkite> looks like a frog trying to climb
[3:50:39] <%Simketh> wow riveting stuff
[3:50:39] <nademonkey1100> the fucking sounds it makes while climbing too
[3:50:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> iT BROKE NEW GROUND
[3:50:41] <Revant_tillywink> YEAH RANDOM BOX SUCK IT
[3:50:42] <%krawtch> is this train going STRAIGHT UP
[3:50:42] <hat_under_bread> I like the manual arm control here. The devs really took important lessons from QWOP
[3:50:43] <conflict1914> WHY IS THERE A FIREBALL THOUGH?
[3:50:43] <Monkeyweed21> WHERE DID HE GET A NEW ARM
[3:50:43] <Dragon_Batman> Nitpicking so much in a terrible video game is like nitpicking eating turds, it's still awful
[3:50:43] <%Meekest> SEAL THIS BOOBOO BEAR INTO THE EARTH
[3:50:44] <$QueequegTheater> BLEY RE6, JAKE IS BEST GAEM
[3:50:44] <%Shady_Squid> Man, when Joe Baker hit zombie men It was great
[3:50:45] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Sven also changed his arm WHILE he was in the lava
[3:50:45] <CritterPatter> They have Spiderman sticking powers.
[3:50:45] <augusta_wind> It looks BAD
[3:50:46] <CloniiCory> The animation in this game is straight trash.
[3:50:46] <%Dhurkst> @Spiralpower1620 Joe Baker would punch his head clean off
[3:50:47] <%StrawberryPantsu> Resident Evil has always been dumb
[3:50:47] <+Kduff89> the animation has been fucked up the whole time
[3:50:49] <wrydiculous> they are just slapping their way forward
[3:50:49] <rcand9> re 6 fans get but mad when you dunk on it
[3:50:50] <%xUmbraNinja> Deep throat?
[3:50:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> That's my penis. Says Sherry
[3:50:55] <%wingblade7> Joe Baker would stand IN the lava and box that thing a full 15 rounds
[3:50:56] <Clu_Flynn> Leon's campaign is still the cringyest tho
[3:50:57] <%cvp5127> wouldnt they get the bends from the change in pressure?
[3:50:57] <Brigins> bullshit
[3:50:59] <Captain_Krunk> For a 2012 game, it's inexcusable for how date it looks and feels
