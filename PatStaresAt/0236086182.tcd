[0:08:42] <+BeastlyP1ays> Jack in the box is best
[0:08:42] <+Nephthyz> She should cosplay as Bridget from Guilty Gear instead.
[0:08:43] <proxycides> RIP the toilet FeelsBadMan
[0:08:47] <%SaltyDongs> Pat don't blame the technical difficulties for losing viewers it's because Max is streaming the literal exact same game
[0:08:49] <%SickBangerzM9> Chicken nuggets dont make me feel like shit. they is good
[0:08:51] <+SirMitternacht> That's why I never eat Mcdonalds

[0:10:05] <Rabura> I see you've enabled Nvidia Hairworks on Paige
[0:10:10] <proxycides> SHUT UP ELMO
[0:10:11] <%finaltrinity5> Paige it's because you're disabled
[0:10:12] <reignbeauxbaer> That's exactly how I felt about Amelia's fur in BB tbh. I was never that impressed. It looked a little weird in the same way that just did
[0:10:14] <darkfire344> my local BK is a franchise that still salts everything. its awesome.
[0:10:17] <bielzitcho> PogChamp
[0:10:18] <+spookyelectrik> give him the stick
[0:10:18] <+potatodono_> she a dragoon?
[0:10:20] <%Jp3g95> I thought she super wiped out there

[0:10:25] <SilverInferno3> Are-ah-neigh-ah
[0:10:29] <denam_of_windscale> @potatodono_ yup
[0:10:29] <CarditoSoRico> can you play as the bad ass chick with the lance?
[0:10:33] <mercado94> good job trowing a granade at the snow bike
[0:10:34] <ThePuddingDead> the hell is Paige wearing on her head?
[0:10:40] <Ranger747> She's a mercenary and likes money
[0:10:43] <%SickBangerzM9> Aranea is the Dark Souls of Final Fantasy
[0:10:43] <@thenefftw> Aranea is just so perfect
[0:10:44] <DotDusk> Why is she not the main character?
[0:10:45] <Worldbrand> Paige is broken
[0:10:48] <Valkyrjsen> Paige's fashion sense is FLAWLESS.
[0:10:50] <ape_hawk> "one day aranea was born, and she was awesome, the end"
[0:10:50] <%AdamRomanus> @ThePuddingDead Standard Canadian headdress, mandated by our government
[0:10:51] <%mcrohan9595> Shut up
[0:10:53] <+fatal_penguin_> Dont forget to harvest those lizard tails boys
[0:10:56] <mr_slaide> THE BABUH
[0:10:57] <HeartlessAku> Paige is broken by design
[0:10:57] <ThePuddingDead> lol nice
[0:11:00] <%finaltrinity5> you NEED IT
[0:11:01] <proxycides> Paige.exe is not responding.
[0:11:03] <%SaltyDongs> This monster hunter streams going well eh Pat
[0:11:04] <+potatodono_> dragoons are so cool, to bad they kind of suck to play
[0:11:06] <mcgaggles> you need fluids pat
[0:11:07] <Dellago> Being stuck as basic bitch Noctis and his boy band when there's some like aranea chilling outside of the main plot still kills me
[0:11:14] <Stratotoaster> so is ffxv finally good or do we have to wait another year?
[0:11:15] <+Atomik456> It looks like Paige has a fro fdrom this angle
[0:11:16] <%commanderclaw> Orange Crush is the best
[0:11:17] <reignbeauxbaer> Paige was built wrong internally, as a joke!
[0:11:21] <+TheRegalPeasant> When are you going to continue Cuphead?
[0:11:22] <+nekomancerer> So you guys know about prime members getting Devil May Cry HD for free?
[0:11:24] <%mcrohan9595> No its piss

[0:11:36] <proxycides> SHUT UP ELMO
[0:11:37] <%SergeEXE> SICK TRICKS
[0:11:38] <ThePuddingDead> huh so this is Aranea?
[0:11:39] <%MisterCrimson> Aranea's entire story is: She was an Imperial Soldier, then she got bored so she stopped
[0:11:40] <+CrystalTree07> pretty sure that is still orange hi-c
[0:11:40] <mcgaggles> saliva piss
[0:11:40] <Valkyrjsen> Aranea isn't playable for the same reason Beatrix never joins your party in FF9.
[0:11:41] <%i_am_therydon> christ i think paige is wearing the literal one thing uglier than her boots.
[0:11:42] <ThePuddingDead> pretty dope
[0:11:47] <CarditoSoRico> sick ollie Kappa
[0:11:48] <FeedbacK7777> Why is Skellmo so hype tho? like guys he's REALLY hype
[0:11:53] <DotDusk> Do a flip PogChamp
[0:11:53] <mercado94> elmo is watching at aranea
[0:11:57] <%AdamRomanus> @MisterCrimson I am to this day upset about that.
[0:11:57] <reignbeauxbaer> Elmo also loves Aranea
[0:12:02] <mantakat> Elmo is staring at aranea's butt
[0:12:02] <mr_slaide> Skelmo does not advertise.
[0:12:04] <Ranger747> That side quest is a re do of the escape from the facility. Like the drive out
[0:12:12] <Ranger747> If I remember right
[0:12:13] <reignbeauxbaer> Elmo: "That coat wouldn't flow in the wind like that."
[0:12:15] <+fatal_penguin_> Would that leather getup actually keep you warm in this environment
[0:12:21] <proxycides> Elmo is too loud tho. He's ruining the stream.
[0:12:21] <%finaltrinity5> schmear
[0:12:22] <%SickBangerzM9> I told you to hug Elmo for me you shmucks
[0:12:25] <%dahaxguy> What is that cute hat that Paige is wearing?
[0:12:30] <mcgaggles> yo! cat!
[0:12:30] <FeedbacK7777> @mantakat makes sense,he's looking up when she jumps i guess. she jumps really high
[0:12:31] <ThePuddingDead> boing hello what is my name my name is Elmo
[0:12:31] <%PatEarthGod> it's da baby
[0:12:34] <darkfire344> ElmoButt!
[0:12:34] <@thenefftw> Every time Aranea isn't on screen, everyone should be asking "Where's Aranea?"
[0:12:36] <Parapattern> Good couch lettuce
[0:12:37] <mr_slaide> OUUUUUUUH. IT'S DAH BABY.
[0:12:39] <CarditoSoRico> what a cute dog
[0:12:43] <SilverInferno3> @fatal_penguin_ Depends if it's padded/insulated on the inside
[0:12:46] <+Skatedeandre> BIG JUMP
[0:12:48] <Ranger747> It makes you look tight as fuck so it doesn't really matter, when you think about it
[0:12:52] <proxycides> T H E B A B Y
[0:12:54] <Grayhammatter> assassino!
[0:12:54] <+TheDon_Corleone> @thenefftw I’m surprised your not pushing for pictures of her cirISee
[0:12:59] <%AdamRomanus> USE THE STICK
[0:13:03] <%SickBangerzM9> Is Prompto going through a Raiden mgr phase?
[0:13:06] <mantakat> I didn't think it was possible to choke out a robot
[0:13:07] <%SickBangerzM9> is he going ripper mode?
[0:13:07] <Rabura> Pat the camera panned up at the guard on the tower for a reason
[0:13:09] <%AbnormalVoid> she can call me short-cake any time
[0:13:12] <mcgaggles> some bourne identity shit
[0:13:16] <darkfire344> does Paige have one of those furry Russian hats on?
[0:13:17] <+fatal_penguin_> Are there phoenix downs in this game
[0:13:17] <Dellago> I did that bug that stuck Aranea in your party, and my final photo, you know the one you choose, was of her. I regret nothing
[0:13:21] <%breakfastmegapowers> Man Paige is getting so strong, her gym must be great cause most American gyms won't let me carry guns like hers *flexes*
[0:13:23] <SilverInferno3> @fatal_penguin_ Yes
[0:13:24] <%SergeEXE> Dragoons are the fuckin' coolest
[0:13:26] <IminyourBase> this is a final fantasy game
[0:13:29] <%RadRegice> man listen to this tekken 7 music
[0:13:35] <Valkyrjsen> Everyone's shooting UZIs and Aranea just runs in there with this weird looking techlance. LUL
[0:13:35] <proxycides> ELMO YOURE TOO HYPE ITS NOT THAT SERIOUS
[0:13:37] <CarditoSoRico> use the red barrels for cover!
[0:13:40] <ThePuddingDead> So Aranea is basically what Lightning SHOULD have been?
[0:13:50] <+fatal_penguin_> I want to play this but im waiting for my original ps4 to die so I can get it on Pro
[0:13:58] <%AbnormalVoid> Kreygasm
[0:13:58] <FeedbacK7777> Kreygasm THAT FUCKING JUMP
[0:14:02] <proxycides> Beautiful jump Kappa
[0:14:05] <darkfire344> Aranea used [J U M P]
[0:14:07] <%DatAsuna> The cut back ruined it
[0:14:09] <%Remery_> Kill monsters to increase your S-Link with Arenea
[0:14:10] <reignbeauxbaer> Yeah but its the final final final final final final final final final final final final final final final fantasy
[0:14:10] <Tophat12> Highwind is such a cool move

[0:14:39] <%AdamRomanus> cheer200 Pat, the Lumen Flare grenades make basic enemies vulnerable, so you can spam the Crackshot at them

[0:15:14] <+dmysta3000> I'd say you got about 20-30 minutes left
[0:15:15] <Skion> this doesnt look like an RPG game LUL
[0:15:18] <%whistlehunter> You'll be done soon
[0:15:18] <Rabura> the final boss is at the very end of the base you're standing in front of

[0:15:43] <%dahaxguy> Those are in the base game tho
[0:15:45] <+DrBunn> This reminds more of Perfect Dark????
[0:15:46] <+Ryo_no_Kage> Because she's a DPS class, just becareful she doesn't go to tank the floor
[0:15:46] <%AdamRomanus> Because Prompto's not as cool as Aranea, so his DPS is lower. That's how damage works. Trust me I am doctor (I am not a doctor)
[0:15:54] <%AbnormalVoid> Prompto gets Trolled
[0:15:56] <proxycides> THE BABY DEMANDS PLAY TIME

[0:18:28] <%AbnormalVoid> @NesosRomanus Woo Woo
[0:18:29] <ThePuddingDead> wow this feels like a 2001 reference
[0:18:29] <proxycides> WE'RE ALL GONNA GET FLUFF JOBS GUYS Jebaited
[0:19:02] <mantakat> you missed a letter
[0:19:10] <%Tman451> what was that noise?
[0:19:13] <Grayhammatter> so let me just listen to this audio log
[0:19:16] <ThePuddingDead> its bluud
[0:19:18] <%AdamRomanus> Paige is hot because she was made in a lab
[0:19:20] <proxycides> Because he's a baby.
[0:19:23] <+fatal_penguin_> How does the FF universe continually exist. Everyone is super evil. From Wakka's final plan to this empire jumbo
[0:19:26] <CarditoSoRico> is that liquid?!
[0:19:27] <katzroy56> pat's horrid eyesight strikes once more
[0:19:27] <mcgaggles> this stream is too cute
[0:19:42] <mcgaggles> regardless of trash
[0:19:44] <@StridentSong> WHAT?!
[0:19:45] <+Jetfandam> guts sword?
[0:19:45] <+fatal_penguin_> 6 shots, more than enough to kill anything that moves
[0:19:46] <darkfire344> Final Fantasy rule #1: every empire is evil. always.
[0:19:48] <theaterunderground> Ahhh. Tom Clancy's Prompto Rainbow Fix. OK.
[0:19:50] <proxycides> Truly we are family streams.
[0:19:54] <ThePlotHole> Yeah, you see her corpse in Ch. 11 or something
[0:20:03] <Gulpunpun> is this just final fantasy 6?
[0:20:04] <SilverInferno3> Cuz they suck
[0:20:05] <+AbnormalEnd> Ｇｏｄ Ｓｌａｙｅｒ
[0:20:06] <ape_hawk> because dont you just wanna KILL GOD?!?!
[0:20:12] <%Fenrirlives> no they didn't! Shiva's too cool!
[0:20:15] <darkfire344> pretty much Just FF6
[0:20:20] <SilverInferno3> The gods in this game are kinda dicks
[0:20:20] <%commanderclaw> Paige wants to hate this game
[0:20:23] <ThePuddingDead> maybe u should pay attention Paige
[0:20:25] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat Also Paige, Pat played the game through like a year ago
[0:20:27] <mcgaggles> pretty much re6
[0:20:30] <ThePuddingDead> maybe look UP
[0:20:34] <@StridentSong> Not acceptable. Not acceptable at all.
[0:20:38] <Gulpunpun> cause using magitek and slaves to kill the summons is the a big thing in ff6
[0:20:40] <%AdamRomanus> USE THE STICK PAT
[0:20:43] <%SickBangerzM9> Paige ruins all the ffxv streams
[0:20:44] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Yeah, this game is pretty barebones and lifeless, just like FF4
[0:20:48] <+fatal_penguin_> Prompto remember this is a sneaking mission
[0:20:51] <wookie5358> Where did Aranaea come from? Well, Paige, when two people love each other very much....
[0:20:53] <Rabura> Ah, the classic FFXV Stream Experience. Paige not watching the game and then complaining about what she missed not existing.
[0:20:54] <CybertronPrime> They're literally just the Garlean Empire.
[0:20:54] <ape_hawk> just unload a clip into the ground, pat
[0:20:55] <$GohanEgret> is this bninary domain 2
[0:20:58] <sosuke5> Is the king like the queen is a king king queen?
[0:21:03] <ThePuddingDead> remember the basics of CQC
[0:21:05] <%breakfastmegapowers> FF2 is the best one though
[0:21:10] <Gulpunpun> except in ff6 I care about the characters
[0:21:10] <@thenefftw> @AngriestPat Paige, you're going into this not liking this game, so you're not bothering to pay attention.
[0:21:12] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[0:21:13] <darkfire344> yeah but in FF6 the summon were more or less just a race of magic beings as opposed to Gods
[0:21:14] <+SuichiTanaka> LUL
[0:21:16] <proxycides> THE STICK PAT
[0:21:20] <+BeastlyP1ays> PAT CANT AIM WORTH SHIT
[0:21:22] <+fatal_penguin_> @breakfastmegapowers you mean FF X-2
[0:21:29] <proxycides> REMEMBER THE STICK
[0:21:34] <Gulpunpun> I mean some were gods and some were dude furry dudes
[0:21:35] <fireking900> FF4 sucks
[0:21:37] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat What is Kain's character?
[0:21:38] <ThePuddingDead> The Sluice Natalia!
[0:21:40] <FenixSeraph> Palom and Porom were shit though
[0:21:41] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat I care way more about my Car Boys WAY more than anyone in FF4
[0:21:41] <%AbnormalVoid> The characters whose only purpose is the kill themselves for the greater good
[0:21:42] <ThePuddingDead> THE SLUUICE
[0:21:43] <%breakfastmegapowers> @fatal_penguin_ no I mean FFXIII-2
[0:21:44] <fireking900> FF6 is WAY better
[0:21:45] <%SickBangerzM9> Yea but im pretty sure paige wasnt staring at her fucking phone when playing ff4 so she actually gave a shit
[0:21:46] <%MisterCrimson> That's incorrect Paige. Nobody cares about FF4
[0:21:46] <+TheDon_Corleone> Who rooBlank
[0:21:48] <+Atomik456> I hated everyone in 4 but love the characters in this
[0:21:49] <ThePlotHole> But that ends up not mattering tho
[0:21:53] <CarditoSoRico> there were FF before 7?!
[0:21:54] <ThePlotHole> Everyone in FF4 lives
[0:21:55] <+fatal_penguin_> @breakfastmegapowers haha
[0:21:56] <mantakat> Paige i am drawn to the characters in ffxv and i like them
[0:22:07] <alextrebeken> so theyre devola and popula
[0:22:08] <+Jetfandam> attack the drones
[0:22:09] <FenixSeraph> FF4 has way too many fakeout deaths that don't stick
[0:22:10] <+Atomik456> The first decent FF game was 5
[0:22:13] <BlitzChocula> I've always wanted petrified Polom and Porom bookends or something
[0:22:13] <ape_hawk> evertim
[0:22:14] <%AdamRomanus> paige cri evertim
[0:22:14] <%AbnormalVoid> FF6 and 7 are the Prime Final fantasies
[0:22:16] <Gulpunpun> FF6 has my wife Terra tho...
[0:22:17] <+tuesti> yall are so salty that paige doesn't like this game lmao
[0:22:21] <wookie5358> So FF4 is a game for 6 year old babies. Got it.
[0:22:23] <+AbnormalEnd> the only final fantasy games i have played are crisis core, dire and 15
[0:22:23] <%dahaxguy> I still care more about the characters in XV than in X.
[0:22:24] <Rabura> Man I L O V E FF4 and I'm not going to defend the fact that half that cast exists only to die
[0:22:24] <proxycides> THIS IS THE FIRST MENTION OF ANY OTHER FF THAN 7.
[0:22:26] <%breakfastmegapowers> Man they just don't make good FF games like 3 anymore
[0:22:28] <Goldenwolf98> Paige is a big babby Kappa
[0:22:29] <@thenefftw> @AngriestPat Paige, you cried when you streamed Beyond Two Souls the other day
[0:22:31] <%Fenrirlives> legit like 15's characters more besides Cecil
[0:22:35] <aeonicvector> 4 and 9 are the best non overrated ff games
[0:22:41] <bittahjuri> step on me aranea
[0:22:41] <Gulpunpun> okay but the DS remake of 3 is one of my favorites
[0:22:45] <%SickBangerzM9> @tuesti its not that she doesnt like it. she is shitting on it even though she isnt paying attention
[0:22:52] <+kinghats> @AngriestPat it just sounds like Aranea is having a way cooler experience offscreen than you are
[0:22:54] <+fatal_penguin_> Much like yo videogames, I love ff8
[0:22:57] <Nitsuj293> Its almost like Paige isnt paying good enough attention to like the characters coxSuure
[0:22:58] <%AdamRomanus> IX is best, Tactics is second
[0:23:02] <ape_hawk> poop
[0:23:04] <%Remery_> over emotional
[0:23:06] <darkfire344> A whole plot point of FF4 is the main guys best friend wants to bang the love interest and turns dark side because she doesn't want him back. Its a literal Anakin moment.
[0:23:13] <theobble> the sad man makes paige sad
[0:23:13] <ThePuddingDead> She was so mad she almost shit her pants
[0:23:13] <proxycides> Aren't you deeply upset everyday Paige?
[0:23:16] <mantakat> Admit it paige you cried when ryan made out with you
[0:23:17] <@thenefftw> We need the Aranea chapter ASAP
[0:23:20] <+TheDon_Corleone> FF X-2 has awkward back massage scene therefore it is the best rooSmug
[0:23:23] <%Remery_> Like my sister crying at everything even when food taste good
[0:23:24] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat But at the end of the day, we can all agree that FF 2 is the best game
[0:23:30] <proxycides> WHY DID YOU MOVE THE BABY
[0:23:31] <CarditoSoRico> oh wow @Gulpunpun i read that like " "okay but the DarkSouls remake of 3 is one of my favorites"
[0:23:33] <+RabbiKing> Disgust is still an emotion
[0:23:36] <CarditoSoRico> got excited for NOTHING
[0:23:41] <Grayhammatter> the baby
[0:23:42] <Gulpunpun> oh god that fucking back massage thing was the weirdest
[0:23:47] <ThePuddingDead> Metal Gear Hippopatamus?
[0:23:48] <darkfire344> FF X-2 was the best for teenage me. it awoke something with that hot spring scene
[0:23:57] <%SickBangerzM9> I think we all need to stop getting mad at paige and realize that all the FF games are complete garbage. Kappa
[0:23:57] <%AdamRomanus> god i love you aranea
[0:24:10] <%Remery_> Eat a misssle
[0:24:10] <mcgaggles> elmo looks mad
[0:24:10] <Gulpunpun> also name Final Fantasy 3 on the DS was fun, but pretty much only for the gameplay and jobs system
[0:24:11] <Grayhammatter> metal gear done killed ya
[0:24:13] <+TheDon_Corleone> @gulpunpun I loved it she was like “why won’t this guy like me “ and I’m like “why am I here again”
[0:24:14] <Stratotoaster> is this binary domain 2?
[0:24:20] <+BeastlyP1ays> man i had to upgrade to windows 10 today and now i have to re install all my games wtf
[0:24:25] <Wauughlord> What is this with the lasers, Nier Automata or some shit?
[0:24:27] <Aussie_Manny> Is this Deus Ex?
[0:24:29] <+fatal_penguin_> ff x was my sexual awakening as a teen. Lulu
[0:24:30] <%breakfastmegapowers> After Yakuza Kiwami 2 happens Yakuza 3 will be the default worst entry after Dead Souls and thats a shame because that needs just as much a redo as 1&2 but it already is HD and nobody cares for its story
[0:24:35] <Grayhammatter> that was a weird camera
[0:24:36] <mantakat> @SickBangerzM9 It's unhealthy to this wrong about everything
[0:24:39] <theobble> where's kain
[0:24:39] <CarditoSoRico> @BeastlyP1ays what do you mean "had to"?
[0:24:41] <proxycides> @aussie_manny I WAS JUST GONNA SAY THAT.
[0:24:43] <Gulpunpun> that's why ff5 has the best gameplay job systems are my absolute fav
[0:24:45] <Aussie_Manny> @fatal_penguin_ You had good taste even as a kid.
[0:24:53] <darkfire344> FFT has best gameplay
[0:24:57] <austinj24> Is this the Krusty Krab
[0:25:00] <+TheDon_Corleone> Man I gotta finish X-2 to see how stupid it gets
[0:25:01] <ThePuddingDead> this gunplay is very reminiscent of Dirge of Cerberus
[0:25:06] <+TeethMuncher> Is it episode prompto good so far?
[0:25:11] <ThePuddingDead> take that what u will
[0:25:14] <%breakfastmegapowers> @austinj24 No, this is Patrick
[0:25:15] <Ranger747> So I'm playing 7 for the first time and I just got Cait Sith. Do y'all like Cait Sith? Iv never heard people talk about him
[0:25:16] <+tuesti> @darkfire344 i love fft omg
[0:25:19] <Aussie_Manny> CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit
[0:25:20] <Gulpunpun> I'm terrible at RTS so I never got into tactics, I really tried I got like 12 hours in before I gave up
[0:25:20] <%Tman451> why not both
[0:25:27] <+fatal_penguin_> wheres grey fox when you need him
[0:25:27] <Aussie_Manny> Elmo, NOOOOOOOO!
[0:25:28] <Valkyrjsen> @ThePuddingDead Do you mean it's bad? Kappa
[0:25:31] <%MisterCrimson> Fun Fact: When cats attain maximum happiness, they revert to the primordial form of fluffy blobs
[0:25:41] <+BeastlyP1ays> @CarditoSoRico i couldn't play certain games do to anti-cheat and the only fix i could find was to upgrade to 10
[0:25:41] <%wsintai> @ThePuddingDead I'll be honest, I like the gunplay in DoC more than Prompto's. It feels "slightly" less floaty
[0:25:45] <RetributionP> yes pat run closer to the robot with the flamethrower
[0:25:46] <Aussie_Manny> Kippa Kippa Kippa
[0:25:47] <+TheDon_Corleone> rooBlank
[0:25:48] <%commanderclaw> Not eating MdDonalds is SO high class
[0:25:54] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat I thought you were a Wendy's household?
[0:25:56] <mcgaggles> was he just running and shooting the robot w/ a revolver?
[0:25:56] <%wsintai> @Ranger747 No one likes Cait Sith. That's why no one talks about him
[0:26:01] <proxycides> ELMO SHUT UP YOURE TOO HYPE MAN
[0:26:03] <+BeastlyP1ays> because the anti cheat was fucked
[0:26:05] <+tuesti> @Ranger747 cait sith is like typical mascot and very much a side character that doesn't matter that much, so i guess that's why most people just don't care
[0:26:06] <Aussie_Manny> @Ranger747 Who? :P
[0:26:09] <+Jetfandam> apathy is also a lolution
[0:26:11] <Grayhammatter> dig up
[0:26:14] <darkfire344> doesn't Kim Jong Un have McDonalds delivered to him all the time?
[0:26:18] <+fatal_penguin_> Elmos such a good kitteh
[0:26:18] <+Jetfandam> just like cold vodka
[0:26:19] <Wauughlord> Yo, fight this metal gear real quick while I loot
[0:26:20] <ThePuddingDead> @Croweirdo At the time I was blinded with Vincent love, coming off of ff7 back in highschool, i stuck with it for the decent story it had and NOT the gameplay
[0:26:21] <+kinghats> Paige is literally trashing up pat's couch
[0:26:22] <darkfire344> by airplane?
[0:26:32] <+Jetfandam> I was drunk the whole last week
[0:26:32] <%Remery_> Paige making nests like the bird woman she is
[0:26:35] <%wsintai> @Ranger747 You'll find out why later
[0:26:47] <CarditoSoRico> @BeastlyP1ays aw that blows, i got scared tho, thought i would have to switch over aswell
[0:26:48] <Aussie_Manny> Fuck off with your McDonald's, Paige. Go get some KFC.
[0:26:52] <%breakfastmegapowers> Tifa is the mascot of FFVII not Cait-Sith
[0:26:52] <%AdamRomanus> USE THE STICK
[0:26:53] <RetributionP> PAT DID PAIGE PICK UP THE FRY?
[0:26:55] <+TeethMuncher> Man, she's just going nuts
[0:26:56] <rocketopaunch> promptos arm sure must be strong
[0:26:59] <+tuesti> @Aussie_Manny popeyes
[0:27:04] <+Jetfandam> damn
[0:27:07] <+fatal_penguin_> I couldnt get into FF7. I tried and tried
[0:27:08] <%koriethecoward> so is this dlc operation shot bang?
[0:27:13] <+TheDon_Corleone> Pat won’t use the stick or take pictures of Best Girl rooFeels
[0:27:14] <%AdamRomanus> A&W fans what up
[0:27:16] <+Jetfandam> damn it all
[0:27:16] <Valkyrjsen> @ThePuddingDead I'm joking. Well, half'joking. I actually like DoC from what I remember, specially the way you could customize guns for different effects. I didn't even play FF7 before Dirge. LUL
[0:27:19] <Gulpunpun> remember at the begging of FF13 when Lightning snapped her fingers to change gravity and then never used it for the rest of the game?
[0:27:23] <Ranger747> Oh. Bummer. Right now I'b struggling to decide wether to have Red in the team or Yuffie. On one hand, Red is cool and fun and interesting. On the other hand, I could have another girl in my team
[0:27:24] <mantakat> Man ya'll motherfuckers need some chick fil a
[0:27:25] <+Jetfandam> I don't deserve shit
[0:27:26] <Aussie_Manny> @tuesti I haven't seen a Popeye's in Australia yet, but I've heard good things. :)
[0:27:29] <proxycides> Floor Fry demands to be stationary.
[0:27:31] <+Jetfandam> that's my problem
[0:27:34] <Gulpunpun> beginning*
[0:27:35] <+kinghats> this feels like a slog
[0:27:35] <Rabura> Yuffie sucks
[0:27:38] <+Jetfandam> I'm a drunk fuck
[0:27:39] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, why is Prompto even here? Aranea can clearly handle this shit on her own
[0:27:48] <RetributionP> I want pat to remember the floor fry
[0:27:49] <Aussie_Manny> @Rabura You sux.
[0:27:49] <%Jp3g95> I'll fil a your chick
[0:27:52] <+fatal_penguin_> Does this game have triple triad lol
[0:27:52] <Rabura> o-oh
[0:27:53] <+BeastlyP1ays> @CarditoSoRico yeah it sucks had to restart my pc twice and download steam all over again before i could down load my games right
[0:27:54] <katzroy56> pat, you've got a melee weapon
[0:27:58] <+tuesti> @Aussie_Manny popeyes has the best fries on earth if u ever get to go to one, get the firs i promise u
[0:27:59] <+Skatedeandre> Yeah this section feels like a slog
[0:28:01] <darkfire344> the WORST FF is arguably the first one, before they refined the gameplay. The story was meh, but it was the 80's
[0:28:08] <+TheDon_Corleone> @wsintai Prompto is here cause Araena was like “quite moping and be useful”
[0:28:12] <%breakfastmegapowers> FF7 is really ruined by anime storylines. It becomes so basic plotwise that its difficult to care
[0:28:13] <Aussie_Manny> @tuesti Will dew. P:
[0:28:22] <%wsintai> @TheDon_Corleone Well, he quit moping at least
[0:28:23] <SilverInferno3> Also Prompto has wrist codes
[0:28:26] <%PatEarthGod> ha, she was trying to jump to the enemy
[0:28:29] <%Remery_> Man I want Wendys
[0:28:29] <Gulpunpun> I thought people said FF2 was the worst one
[0:28:31] <SilverInferno3> That he tried to burn off
[0:28:33] <%breakfastmegapowers> @darkfire344 No, 2 was the worst
[0:28:38] <Aussie_Manny> WOOOO, EXPOSITION FILE!
[0:28:44] <+TheDon_Corleone> @wsintai exactly now he is just staying for the booty rooLewd
[0:28:44] <mantakat> @darkfire344 ff1 is pretty good on the psp
[0:28:46] <darkfire344> FF8 has a decent story imo
[0:28:49] <%wsintai> @Gulpunpun FF2 is great. But you know, personal taste
[0:28:57] <+tuesti> FF1 had me fucked up if u stop playing for a week good luck remembering where the fuCK you were going
[0:29:01] <+fatal_penguin_> im hoping the remake to ff7 might spur my interest since the PS1 version didnt
[0:29:02] <CarditoSoRico> @BeastlyP1ays did you have emulators and mods and shit?
[0:29:04] <%AdamRomanus> FFVII still has one of the more interesting worlds, even though the story sort of falls apart after Cloud gets out of the Lifestream
[0:29:04] <+Skatedeandre> How did you level up in ff2 again?
[0:29:07] <Aussie_Manny> FFVI had the best story I've played in a FF.
[0:29:08] <%SickBangerzM9> Was this dlc a half joke? Its a shooter with god damn audio logs
[0:29:10] <aeonicvector> 4 and 9 guys, legit great and overlooked games
[0:29:13] <+QuickSilver_357> You mean it had a great card game right?
[0:29:13] <Ranger747> @darkfire344 it feels hard to call the story meh, rather than calling it nothing. Their's really nothing going on, it's all mechanics pioneering
[0:29:19] <rocketopaunch> this guy is a resident evil villain
[0:29:23] <%Remery_> Vivi forever <3
[0:29:25] <+Jetfandam> I have no values anymore. I close my eyes and feel nothing
[0:29:28] <proxycides> Final Fantasy 2 is the best. SUE ME
[0:29:29] <darkfire344> No, I mean the original FF1. I had it on NES
[0:29:30] <+Jetfandam> it's ükay
[0:29:31] <%breakfastmegapowers> Chrono Trigger is still the best FF
[0:29:36] <ThePuddingDead> ^
[0:29:36] <mcgaggles> his resident evil job
[0:29:40] <SilverInferno3> Dude's head scientist for a reason
[0:29:47] <RetributionP> Pay French fry
[0:29:48] <%AbnormalVoid> Do they every explain where the hell the demons came from?
[0:29:48] <austinj24> FFXIII best Final Fantasy dont @ me Kappa
[0:29:49] <mantakat> @wsintai ff2 is a grind to get through but apart from that the story was a huge leap from ff1
[0:29:52] <+cvp5127> twewy is the best ff
[0:29:53] <%AbnormalVoid> ever*
[0:29:55] <%SickBangerzM9> I thought Kingdom Hearts was the best Final Fantasy
[0:29:57] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat I'm glad that despite all the arguing, and accounting for personal taste, we can all agree FF2 is the best game in the series.
[0:29:58] <proxycides> @breakfastmegapowers YOU DO THAT OUTSIDE, NOT INDOORS.
[0:29:58] <SilverInferno3> @AbnormalVoid Yes, actually
[0:30:00] <%the_mental_punk> Hey this is my first time to a pat stream. What's up everybody?'
[0:30:06] <%breakfastmegapowers> @proxycides hears your subpeona*
[0:30:06] <%Keyd00d> my favorite final fantasy > your favorite final fantasy
[0:30:06] <FenixSeraph> WITNESS THE MIGHT OF THE JABARI FIRSTHAND
[0:30:10] <+BeastlyP1ays> @CarditoSoRico emulators no, mods yes, but from what i can tell they are mostly fine its just redownloading the games is all
[0:30:14] <+T_Rep> welcome buddy
[0:30:15] <Ranger747> Vivi is my favorite Kingdom Hearts character I love his voice
[0:30:17] <+fatal_penguin_> ff13 was the only game I used Gamestop's refund policy
[0:30:22] <mcgaggles> itchy tasty
[0:30:23] <mantakat> Honestly guys final fantasy xxx is the best one
[0:30:26] <SilverInferno3> @AbnormalVoid They're basically from a plague that the gods sent down from their war
[0:30:30] <+TheDon_Corleone> @wsintai FF2 doesn’t have dress up parties like FF X-2 so I think we know which is superior rooSmug
[0:30:39] <%commanderclaw> The RUBY WEAPON?
[0:30:42] <ThePuddingDead> Fun fact: Those big ass demons you see carpet bombing the crown city were straight Diamond Weapon from 7....like they didnt even hint it was something else
[0:30:44] <%SickBangerzM9> FF27 from Deus Ex Human Revolution is the best FF
[0:30:47] <PessimisticOptimism> Ultra mega happy diamond weapon
[0:30:47] <%dahaxguy> @NesosRomanus I like the locations in 7, but a lot of the lore binding the world together (and defining some of the settlements) was kinda poor, and I even thought that before I played the rest of the FFs.
[0:30:48] <RetributionP> pat French fry
[0:30:49] <%AbnormalVoid> @SilverInferno3 huh, weird
[0:30:49] <%wsintai> @TheDon_Corleone Why would you want to dress up Firion though? He's already so sexy
[0:30:53] <darkfire344> Call me crazy, but I Liked FF13. To a point. It was something new and had its appeal. But fuck that level up system holy shit
[0:30:56] <%breakfastmegapowers> Any FF without Active Time combat is for babies
[0:30:59] <BlitzChocula> but when will Elmo get a mic
[0:31:00] <%T_Rep> I"M SUBBED BOYS
[0:31:10] <+TheDon_Corleone> @wsintai 2 words Beach Episode rooHappy
[0:31:11] <+fatal_penguin_> Is this emperor palptines voice
[0:31:28] <mantakat> ff13's trailer was the best
[0:31:31] <@thenefftw> OH YEAH
[0:31:31] <Press_X_ToJASON> the only people who dont think Chrono Trigger is the best Final Fantasy game are people who have only played the iOS/Steam version
[0:31:33] <aeonicvector> @breakfastmegapowers any FF where you can get the ultimate weapon in more then 14 hours is for babies Kappa
[0:31:34] <proxycides> Elmo is perfect as he is. PAIGE FOCUS ON SWEET BABY ELMO.

[0:39:40] <time_axis> like the immortal toilet
[0:39:41] <SilverInferno3> @alextrebeken TO HIT THE EARTHS BACK
[0:39:43] <aeonicvector> Its like hitting the back, of a PLANET

[0:39:46] <CarditoSoRico> giant sentient kaiju dick

[0:39:51] <Valkyrjsen> I'M IMMORTAL!! Except if someone shoots me with a GUN! Then I'd die.
[0:39:51] <+Skatedeandre> Huh

[0:39:52] <fattyboy067> so does the boss shoot?
[0:39:55] <PessimisticOptimism> It’s big tho and that means it’s the last one
[0:39:55] <+fatal_penguin_> It's the Shagohod chase scene from MGS3
[0:40:00] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> @AngriestPat you did get an audio file saying that consciousness can be transferred over and over and over again
[0:40:00] <+RogueDarkJedi> NOT YET PROMPTO, IT'S NOT OVER YET
[0:40:01] <darkfire344> Who else excited for Pacific Rim?!
[0:40:02] <+Skatedeandre> What was the point of that cutscenes
[0:40:05] <puddingpants88> so there was a giant explosion at the tip of the dick
[0:40:06] <+MrMcCrabby> says the man who wants to be a toilet
[0:40:07] <Rabura> It's cooler than a toilet
[0:40:07] <%Jp3g95> This is the part where collective conciousness plays
[0:40:10] <%commanderclaw> This is the Snowgohod
[0:40:10] <General_Terro> says pat the guy whos ok with being a toilet
[0:40:10] <%AdamRomanus> @Croweirdo Oh no! A gun! The one thing I never thought to defend against!
[0:40:11] <mcgaggles> uncle andross!

[0:40:18] <+MechaBaphomet> he was always a big dick
[0:40:19] <Louie_Salmon> You don't know, maybe being a giant worm is super cool and fun
[0:40:27] <mantakat> @AngriestPat Don't knock the worm life until you try it
[0:40:30] <+AbnormalEnd> wouldn't a better name like Devourer or some shit
[0:40:30] <wookie5358> Dicks are the progenitors of life; what better to represent immortality
[0:40:31] <Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat You said youd be a fuckin toilet to be immortal Pat who are you to judge Kappa

[0:41:25] <+BeastlyP1ays> THEY PLAYED PAT LIKE A GOD DAMN FIDDLE
[0:41:25] <mcgaggles> naga
[0:41:25] <%Keyd00d> final fantasy sure has changed
[0:41:26] <Louie_Salmon> How can this be? Your GUN was more powerful than I thought!
[0:41:28] <Twoiis> jerk him harder.
[0:41:29] <%Remery_> Hydra Dick
[0:41:29] <alextrebeken> cuz you need the lame phase so you can apprecite the cool one
[0:41:30] <+Atomik456> I mean
[0:41:30] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> @AngriestPat you did get an audio file saying that consciousness can be transferred over and over and over again
[0:41:34] <+Atomik456> He is crazy
[0:41:37] <themightyseptopus> man look at this RPG
[0:41:42] <ThePuddingDead> i mean its a really cool set piece
[0:41:42] <CarditoSoRico> why not just start with that form?
[0:41:44] <PessimisticOptimism> believe in friends and justice!
[0:41:45] <%AbnormalVoid> Man, Gods are lame
[0:41:47] <+QuickSilver_357> rooGasm rooGasm playing the fiddle way to hard there
[0:41:47] <Goldenwolf98> @mantakat Gods are to big to use guns they would be fucked
[0:41:48] <wookie5358> There may be a slightly fatal flaw in its design
[0:41:53] <+RogueDarkJedi> BELIEVE IN YOUR OWN JUSTICE
[0:41:56] <+fatal_penguin_> Man this whole fight just screams Final Fantasy
[0:41:56] <%SickBangerzM9> Do they plan to shove this thing up the gods asses? Whats the end game here?
[0:41:56] <+Atomik456> Nanocmachines?
[0:41:57] <+RogueDarkJedi> MR. PRESIDENT
[0:41:58] <mcgaggles> whatever the multiheaded snake in hindu is
[0:41:59] <darkfire344> its basically the Vegnagun fight
[0:42:00] <%Jp3g95> RICHAAAAAAAAAAARD
[0:42:00] <wookie5358> Like dropping a socket wrench in the death star's exhaust port
[0:42:02] <%SolitaryDrake> The character in this game have killed gods over and over with fucking swords.
[0:42:03] <%captainthunderwolf> @NesosRomanus So if you could condense it into a chat-appropriate size, why exactly is Dirge of Cerberus so awful? I legitimately have no experience with it.
[0:42:03] <+linSP> what if you didnt have cars, what would you do strap a machine gun to a chocobo
[0:42:04] <%AdamRomanus> Nothing says Final Fantasy like Gorilla Gear Solid and Mecha Dick
[0:42:05] <%breakfastmegapowers> Thats Final Fantasy for you, killed God with a baller sword and Martial Arts skills
[0:42:06] <puddingpants88> well you basically stab god to death in the main game
[0:42:06] <time_axis> this probably used to be way harder then got toned down in testing to the point of being trivial
[0:42:07] <+kinghats> this is kinda boring and not at all excitng
[0:42:09] <NoctisFatehart> Well CLEARLY he is just tired from soul linking!
[0:42:11] <Valkyrjsen> It doesn't even have like an overheat mechanic. Just keep the button pressed. LUL
[0:42:16] <+Skatedeandre> Yeah this is a little boring
[0:42:18] <FeedbacK7777> OOH pretty lights
[0:42:18] <%Keyd00d> just hold down a button you win yay
[0:42:22] <+QuickSilver_357> Chat is more entertaining than this boss fight lmao
[0:42:23] <Worldbrand> this fight has a terrible amount of feedback, after watching the binary domain LP
[0:42:23] <NoctisFatehart> Give it some time and he’ll become immortal!
[0:42:23] <+spookyelectrik> moogles riding snowmobiles instant death
[0:42:24] <PessimisticOptimism> I bet kiryu would punch it to death out of principle alone
[0:42:25] <+BeastlyP1ays> @AngriestPat i mean they run off of doom logic when it comes to guns in this game
[0:42:26] <FeedbacK7777> PREPARE FOR IMPACT, GENTLEMEN
[0:42:27] <aeonicvector> Its rock paper scissors, Gun beats mech, mech beats god, god beats gun
[0:42:27] <poweredscoot> Gods < Gods-killing-machine < rooty-tooty point and shooty
[0:42:28] <Press_X_ToJASON> i love the lifesteal of 1hp per bullet, maximum final fantasy right here
[0:42:29] <+MechaBaphomet> Good thing he designed this weapon with a big red glowing weak point
[0:42:29] <@thenefftw> Nice
[0:42:35] <%Remery_> Open the Dickhole
[0:42:35] <SilverInferno3> Yeah it looks cool but it plays lame
[0:42:35] <+RogueDarkJedi> haha MICHAEL
[0:42:37] <theobble> gg
[0:42:40] <+Skatedeandre> This is one of the dudes greatest creation
[0:42:40] <+Hamblasto> Who thought that would be a good boss fight?
[0:42:42] <%captainthunderwolf> Was that fucking robot trying to cast Ultima?
[0:42:43] <%Keyd00d> I bet that feels like a good accomplishment
[0:42:43] <+RogueDarkJedi> RICHARDDDDDDD!
[0:42:44] <%SaltyDongs> now dead

[0:45:01] <+fatal_penguin_> Did we get the Big Boss rank
[0:45:02] <+TheBossSkeleton> Pat the lore is that Ardyn took the tech know how from an ancient society known as solheim, the king was ifrit at one point as well. the star scorge first affected them and killed off the society ardyn then used the info and leaked it to the nifs and slowly gained power and warned them of sheevas awake and to ambush her
[0:45:03] <%captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat He's so evil, and he loves it. You have to respect that.

[0:45:39] <%Keyd00d> who can say
[0:45:40] <+RogueDarkJedi> it was bdsm gone wrong
[0:45:41] <time_axis> because Ardyn, basically
[0:45:41] <Rabura> it happened because Ardyn's a dick
[0:45:41] <FeedbacK7777> Don't tell ocelot!

[0:45:50] <FenixSeraph> I hate that this DLC still didn't explain this at all
[0:45:52] <SilverInferno3> Ardyn's kind of unstoppable, I'm guessing
[0:45:52] <RetributionP> it was all a dream
[0:45:52] <+cvp5127> shhhhhhhhhhh

[0:46:24] <+RogueDarkJedi> TEAM PROMPTO
[0:46:25] <%SickBangerzM9> Tiny twink gets crucified by big fedora man
[0:46:27] <Grayhammatter> TEAM PROMPTO
[0:46:28] <+Skatedeandre> Yeah doesn’t this scene imply he fails BIG TIME?
[0:46:29] <%XzileGaming> watch the newgrounds pornography game LP to find out how he got on that cross
[0:46:29] <Rabura> Ardyn was like "Okay you had your adventure now I need to use you to piss off Noctis"
[0:46:29] <mcgaggles> team bottom
[0:46:30] <+RogueDarkJedi> ! WOW !
[0:46:30] <SilverInferno3> They tried to imply it by showing Ardyn but yeah they shouldve done more
[0:46:30] <%breakfastmegapowers> Stay tuned for Prompto storyline DLC in FFXV-2
[0:46:30] <%AbnormalVoid> Prompto seriously looks like he's in a Gachimuchi video
[0:46:32] <%captainthunderwolf> @NoctisFatehart It makes more sense if you don't think about it.
[0:46:32] <rocketopaunch> jeez it must suck to have your name named team prompto

[0:46:35] <FeedbacK7777> TEAM PROMPTO
[0:46:41] <%Remery_> Ardyn changed his clothes
[0:46:42] <%AdamRomanus> @SickBangerzM9 (gone SEXUAL)
[0:46:45] <+TheBossSkeleton> shouldve had aranea be actually ardyn and then when the boss is beat do a quick reveal and have him knock him out, would have made more sense
[0:46:46] <RetributionP> it was all a dream he was all scared up from falling off the train
[0:46:51] <aeonicvector> Arenea fight tho
[0:46:52] <+Nephthyz> @AbnormalVoid RIP Billy
[0:46:55] <+RogueDarkJedi> @NesosRomanus (PRISON?)
[0:47:02] <iq_dropper> You got to do Aranea Boss Fight
[0:47:08] <faldin> he could have just taken off the winter clothes when it wasn't cold anymore
[0:47:08] <%captainthunderwolf> @SpookieSkelz If Aranea was Ardyn this whole time, that would have been sick.
[0:47:11] <SilverInferno3> Ayyyyyy the crew
[0:47:13] <%Remery_> All i saw was abs
[0:47:16] <mcgaggles> then the sex
[0:47:18] <denam_of_windscale> is da bois!

[0:48:00] <RetributionP> play the game
[0:48:00] <FenixSeraph> then Noctis comes out looking super hot
[0:48:02] <%Keyd00d> these really don't make the game that much better to me

[0:48:04] <%SolitaryDrake> @NesosRomanus Fucking right?
[0:48:04] <%captainthunderwolf> Final Fantasy XV is the most well-polished a game has ever been relative to the inordinate about of mismanagement and horrible fucking flaws it has.
[0:48:05] <+Skatedeandre> @roguedarkjedi Jedi mind trick
[0:48:08] <%captainthunderwolf> Does anyone else feel that?

[0:49:47] <%captainthunderwolf> @NesosRomanus You say "at least" bi and think, "Or more than that, gay". I read "at least" bi and I think, "Pansexual furry with an Etsy and political views he does not like challenged." That would take the story in a novel direction.

[0:50:34] <mantakat> @AngriestPat episode ignis is the best one
[0:50:35] <ThePuddingDead> i'd say it did fine
[0:50:36] <FeedbacK7777> My only problem is indoors look too dark, i can barely see on my pc, there's something wrong with the game
[0:50:38] <mr_slaide> DAH BABY
[0:50:38] <FenixSeraph> it's better written
[0:50:39] <%MisterCrimson> That gun is just Squall's gunblade without the stupid sword part
[0:50:40] <%captainthunderwolf> @SolitaryDrake It's a gorgeous wet dumpster fire soaked in shredded hundred dollars bills lit up with expensive vodka and at least two careers.
[0:50:42] <aeonicvector> just a single shot, we dont expect you to win
[0:50:42] <Humanpeep> The revolver he's holding is clipping through his hands, holy shit.
[0:50:43] <%the_mental_punk> been thinking about getting this game, but i really don't have that much experience with ff besides ffx. is it worth it?
[0:50:43] <%Keyd00d> I just want a different game
[0:50:44] <%breakfastmegapowers> 2hrs and 52 mins til 420 yall
[0:50:47] <%AdamRomanus> I had more fun with Gladio's...
[0:50:48] <+Deathtocubes> 2cute
[0:50:56] <RetributionP> let's hope it's not another 2 months until ignis
[0:50:56] <SilverInferno3> It gave us crackshot which is AMAZING in base game so I liked it
[0:50:57] <%EdHeng> apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep
[0:50:59] <+MrMcCrabby> i thought it was a lot of fun playing aranea and prompto
[0:51:03] <ThePuddingDead> shots fired
[0:51:05] <denam_of_windscale> it's only 1:28 am sleep is for the WEAK
[0:51:11] <+LogothX> Has paige turned into a cat?
[0:51:11] <@thenefftw> Such a good baby

[0:51:14] <+Bupkis7> ELMO
[0:51:16] <+Hamblasto> Why does Pat have to sign off. Can't we just have a 24/7 Elmo cam?

[0:51:34] <%AdamRomanus> ARANEA THE DOMINATRIX PLEASE COME OVER TO MY HOUSE TO HANG OUT
[0:51:36] <%breakfastmegapowers> Clean rips
[0:51:39] <%Jp3g95> It tasts good ma'am thank you
[0:51:41] <%SolitaryDrake> @captainthunderwolf The bit on the podcast last week was spot on. People are going to be argueing about whether or not its good based on when they played it forever. I played it right after the first patch. Fun, but super flawed.
[0:51:42] <HeartlessAku> @AngriestPat See you later pat keep getting huge have a nice night
[0:51:44] <RetributionP> elmo 24 hour stream
[0:51:53] <+TeethMuncher> Prompto is his slave name
[0:52:00] <ThePuddingDead> Stampers new game its fun :3
[0:52:03] <SilverInferno3> @the_mental_punk I think it's a fun game that's worth the money, and all the DLCs come for free with the PC version
[0:52:03] <+fatal_penguin_> elmo 24 hour scream stream
[0:52:05] <AirlineFood74> YOU NEED TO PLAY IT
[0:52:13] <AirlineFood74> w paige
[0:52:15] <%commanderclaw> Pit People is a tactics game from the Castle Crashers guys
[0:52:15] <Louie_Salmon> Crush me with your dragoon-jumping thighs, Aranea
[0:52:27] <vivecdidnothingwrong> ???
[0:52:30] <%MisterCrimson> New Dan Paladin game. it's an Srpg with Stamper
[0:52:41] <%AdamRomanus> I KNOW WHAT I CAME HERE FOR
[0:52:45] <+fatal_penguin_> To end this stream, now we Pray
[0:52:46] <wookie5358> Pit People is aight. Turn based tactics by The Behemoth
[0:52:46] <%breakfastmegapowers> Thats probably in reference to the Promptos father moment
[0:52:47] <@thenefftw> We need more Elmo petting
[0:52:48] <Louie_Salmon> Given how that Into the Breach video went, I don't think Pat should play a tactics game on stream
[0:53:01] <%Jp3g95> HE SCRATCH
[0:53:05] <JoshuaGLewis> Hey dudes Nier Automata is 50% off on Steam
[0:53:07] <%captainthunderwolf> @SolitaryDrake The fact that they have essentially added mechanics and content to the game in patches since it came out proves how incredibly early it was released relative to its development schedule. I think first patch FFXV is a good game that straddles the line more sharply than any AAA game should. I've heard that the fully updated version is dramatically better now.
[0:53:11] <%DarkOnyx7> apatPorgmo
[0:53:15] <%MisterCrimson> I googled Potoo. It is literally apatPorgmo
[0:53:25] <ThePuddingDead> Nier Automata at 50% seriously thats a GOOD BUY!
[0:53:29] <mcgaggles> And after this streak I'm hopping over to Vinny's
[0:53:30] <+cvp5127> use a guide
[0:53:34] <mcgaggles> *stream
[0:53:51] <+fatal_penguin_> Elmo's so proper tonight
[0:53:51] <@thenefftw> Attentive Elmo
[0:53:58] <FunkyStreams> It's interesting how Elmo's peculiar brain causes him have an instinct for stage presence.
[0:53:59] <%AdamRomanus> Elmo is _so fucking cute_
[0:53:59] <%breakfastmegapowers> @ThePuddingDead Nier Automata at 200% is a good buy
[0:54:08] <%captainthunderwolf> "I got 'cha-bitch'." - Patrick Boivin, 2018
[0:54:10] <SilverInferno3> Yes that is true
[0:54:11] <%AdamRomanus> @breakfastmegapowers you're not wrong
[0:54:15] <FenixSeraph> Elmo so fluffy
[0:54:19] <ThePuddingDead> @breakfastmegapowers Oh you! ;3

[0:55:07] <ThePuddingDead> STFU Elmo!
[0:55:08] <%SolitaryDrake> @captainthunderwolf I've heard a few people dislike the fact that they've continued support like this because, why not just delay it. That seems insane. I'll happily go through all the DLC once ALL of its out, but I have not inclination to play it again before then.
