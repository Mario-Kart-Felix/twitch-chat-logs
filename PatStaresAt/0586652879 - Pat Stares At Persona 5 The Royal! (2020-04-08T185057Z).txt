[0:10:34] <old_dog_god> Kiryu for Smash
[0:10:34] <%UvBenServed> When they make Persona (For Girls)
[0:10:35] <fenrirmitsuki> The extra scenes are nice, but I really wanted to officially date Sojiro.
[0:10:40] <%JonesMcFly> Atlus will never let us date those sexy boys, because they are cowards!

[0:22:36] <%baronblank> Gonna have to avoid all these ff7 streams tomorrow so I can play it with as few spoilers as possible
[0:22:37] <%frydaynitefight> thtas fair
[0:22:38] <%baronblank> maaan
[0:22:39] <+amiroodude> That's fair
[0:22:40] <%optimasmaximas> ooooohhhhhh
[0:22:43] <%FalseEyeD> Spoilers INBOUND
[0:22:44] <%optimasmaximas> that’s fair
[0:22:45] <%Nobrev> Hahaha non sub peasants
[0:22:46] <OldManDeckardCain> DO EMOTE ONLY, IDIOTS CAN STILL SPOIL YOU WITH CHANNEL POINTS
[0:22:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Lame, but understandable I suppose
[0:22:47] <%Typhaeon> Then people will have to pay to post spoilers and get banned immediately
[0:22:47] <+tigerfang86> I NEED SUB POWERRRRR
[0:22:48] <%FacetiousAF> I like these ideas
[0:22:48] <%Reveresao> fair
[0:22:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> Sub Mode is coward mode

[0:22:52] <+rendingmelody> HahaSweat
[0:22:54] <%j0ustar> no shh
[0:22:57] <%Jekado> or early late?
[0:22:59] <Aydarkzero> @Typhaeon this is the way
[0:22:59] <%valriot> @patstaresat There are things to spoil, it's completely justified
[0:23:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> SUB MODE IS FOR COWARDS
[0:23:00] <+amiroodude> Spoilers are already everywhere
[0:23:02] <PirateMike_> NO

[2:42:18] <%UvBenServed> Ah, yet
[2:42:18] <+Jonesman64> if you aren't over powered... you're under powered
[2:42:19] <RedAhoge> is this pats first official playthrough?
[2:42:22] <%MonsterEnvy> Wanna bump the difficulty up. You can always turn it back down
[2:42:23] <$RealThiele> pat take cheats to become huge
[2:42:27] <%shurtal> Ah, Mementos, the freshmaker
[2:42:28] <YakumoYomi> "Impossible! None are as huge as I!"
[2:42:30] <%extradopeness> You’ve Hee’d your last Ho
[2:42:33] <+zeejaymac> "Why use the lockpick? You might need it later!" The Goblins
[2:42:34] <valachi> coward
[2:42:38] <%cervidaequus> cervidaequus subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 24 months! I finally got my biggest, grossest eyeball ever! SWEET!
[2:42:41] <%mankeyfigh> coward
[2:42:41] <+Arbal3st> To SUFFER
[2:42:41] <%MonsterEnvy> Cause it would be more fun
[2:42:44] <+gladiongamestcg2> what difficulty is it on?
[2:42:45] <%zestyArsenic> less exp and money on hard, its dumb
[2:42:47] <%Maids4lyfe> STOP TELLING PEOPLE HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
[2:42:48] <%asgard147> SourPls
[2:42:50] <%Klefth> The game's more fun in hard, tbh
[2:42:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> COWARD CASUAL
[2:42:54] <zenorot> how are you going to cheat with no difficulty
[2:42:58] <QilinRequiem> is takeover your favourite battle theme now? Or is it just cause it's new
[2:42:59] <$Dakuu75> @RedAhoge he beat the OG vanilla game when it first came out. now this is his first run of the "royal" edition
[2:43:03] <aluddss> SourPls
[2:43:05] <shiny_prinny> i wish you could change the field music in Mementos
[2:43:19] <%vectorless_peon> why do so many people want it to be hard? Its a JRPG not Dark Souls
[2:43:20] <%kyh9> Pumping the difficulty up in most turn-based RPGs usually ends up just making it a matter of how much you have to grind
[2:43:20] <WanderingSwordsman> I bumped it to hard at its still easy
[2:43:23] <%MonsterEnvy> The music chagnes on it's own now
[2:43:25] <%starotter70> P3P Femc theme is best
[2:43:27] <FrankysDream> i love the way mona car bends so cartoonishly
[2:43:29] <%CursedNobleman> @kyh9 facts
[2:43:35] <+walnutcast> i want it HARD baybeeeee
[2:43:37] <oceanmatt> cause game easy
[2:43:43] <%MonsterEnvy> I just like a bit of a challenge
[2:43:43] <robo_badger> I like stomping on people
[2:43:45] <RedAhoge> @Dakuu75 ah thx
[2:43:46] <+gustavozxd> obviously dark souls is the only hard game in the world
[2:43:46] <%Klefth> It just makes the fights more interesting
[2:43:47] <%j0ustar> MuH gAmEs MuSt Be HaRd tO bE fUn
[2:43:47] <+Jonesman64> cause try hard simps
[2:43:47] <+Greywyn00> A challenge keeps it from getting boring
[2:43:48] <pi_in_the_sci> Dark Soulds is RPG
[2:43:51] <CuttleCrow> but Pat we need MORE GRINDING
[2:43:53] <spinbel> Why play a game that plays itself
[2:43:54] <robo_badger> Shit being easy is great
[2:43:54] <%Maids4lyfe> WHO CARES IF IT'S EASY HE'S HAVING FUN
[2:43:55] <%코코꾸라> If you want it hard, play on Merciless
[2:43:55] <%MaddyCaddy> Poor Pixie
[2:43:56] <%코코꾸라> Fucker
[2:43:56] <RedAhoge> Kill
[2:43:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> We to see the STRUGGLE PAT
[2:43:57] <shiny_prinny> FOR REAL
[2:43:59] <%spiritofmojave> FOR REAL?
[2:43:59] <DuoScratch> it's a STORY GAME, it's not meant to be DS difficult.
[2:44:00] <%GarbageNirvana> Go back to harassing Jerma
[2:44:01] <+knowyourenemy_97> Eff Pixie
[2:44:02] <%vectorless_peon> an easy JRPG is calm relaxing and fun
[2:44:02] <bakkatohri> I find you can tell how well a game is designed by how rewarding the hard difficulties are.
[2:44:04] <+Jp3g95> the Music turns into Take Over when you ambush. Otherwise its the same as before
[2:44:04] <%colouroftheiris77> Oh no, I'm not dying enough!
[2:44:04] <Wan6Saber> cause they have shit taste
[2:44:06] <DashXero> TRUTH.
[2:44:06] <%j0ustar> Truth
[2:44:06] <%CursedNobleman> FACTS
[2:44:07] <%kyh9> @CursedNobleman It's not like the AI gets smarter or new moves
[2:44:07] <Whiteowlsmith> facts
[2:44:10] <%kyh9> Yeah
[2:44:11] <%MaddyCaddy> Demifiend wants to know your location
[2:44:14] <$RealThiele> big cheese like absorb element in FF
[2:44:14] <RedAhoge> Power trips are awesome.... saddly
[2:44:14] <%Dragon_Batman> I do it sometimes cuz I want a bit of a back and forth and not just press the button to win
[2:44:16] <%mankeyfigh> not really...
[2:44:18] <+zeejaymac> The point is to not let the enemy play
[2:44:21] <+angelmorphic> That's only interesting if you work for it
[2:44:21] <%mighty_max_t> I guess for some people difficulty equals fun
[2:44:22] <+gustavozxd> yeah when you know what you're doing sure it's cool
[2:44:22] <+zacyzacy> did they change the streaming rules?
[2:44:26] <WanderingSwordsman> @patstaresat the sprint automatically abuse enemies when you drive mona
[2:44:26] <%CursedNobleman> @kyh9 even in tactics games it doesnt do much but make number bigger. infuriating
[2:44:28] <fenrirmitsuki> Steamrolling is fun.
[2:44:30] <%코코꾸라> Just make it harder 4Head
[2:44:32] <zenorot> atlus really got screwed over with demon souls/dark souls
[2:44:32] <+Jonesman64> momentos music is super... borint
[2:44:33] <Copperama> !uptime
[2:44:34] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 44m.
[2:44:34] <+hod_fareview> FOR REAL
[2:44:36] <+Grim_kraken> For real!?
[2:44:37] <aluddss> FOR REAL
[2:44:39] <%코코꾸라> FOR REAL
[2:44:40] <%valriot> @patstaresat I have a Yoshitsune with a Triple damage Charge buff, and it's the funniest shit
[2:44:40] <+OneGorillionDollars> Giving the enemies health multipliers is so interesting right chat? LUL
[2:44:40] <Strider222> DIE
[2:44:44] <$RealThiele> for play play
[2:44:44] <DiddlesHimself> 2
[2:44:46] <%kyh9> @CursedNobleman Exactly. It's part of the shitty school of game design that a game is difficult the more pissed off it makes the player
[2:44:46] <%thenumber5point5> If you want the game harder, play it yourself.. Watching someone play it is the easy or easy mode
[2:44:48] <+pectusumbra> can you not extort those last enemies for money or items?
[2:44:49] <$vincerocmm> fo real dead
[2:44:50] <%MonsterEnvy> Mementos has new music on other floors
[2:44:50] <bakkatohri> A good hard mode should make the player use all the mechanics a game has.
[2:44:50] <schneidernoah6> 2
[2:44:52] <%mankeyfigh> it's too easy
[2:44:53] <QilinRequiem> While I would bump up the difficulty personally, it doesn't make sense for streaming purposes
[2:44:54] <OldManDeckardCain> who knew ryuji was a pixie Kappa
[2:44:58] <+JFrostyBeats> hard in persona suck ass
[2:45:01] <nopgnikatnight> Pankace
[2:45:03] <+BionoidLCR> SourPls
[2:45:07] <%j0ustar> it also makes for a more streamlined experience. RPG hard mode is just GRIND for 5 extra hours
[2:45:08] <+gustavozxd> @OneGorillionDollars worst difficulty setting in videogames
[2:45:10] <%Laecerelius> Yeah! Time to grind!
[2:45:12] <$RealThiele> ryuji is manbo no.5
[2:45:13] <%starotter70> Good ol' Pulinpa trick
[2:45:14] <+Chronobot> time for cash money time
[2:45:18] <%kyh9> Persona 5 is always too easy, bumping up the difficulty just makes it a matter of how much time you have to waste
[2:45:18] <+Grim_kraken> FOR REAL
[2:45:18] <bakkatohri> GOLD FARMIN TIME BOYYYYS
[2:45:20] <+TheShisno> So does Atlus not give a shit?
[2:45:22] <crovvv> All hard does is make the game slower
[2:45:27] <Azure_Storm> Dosh dosh dosh, money, money, monaaaaay
[2:45:28] <+Snorlax321> infinate money PogChamp
[2:45:29] <rbakervv> @PatStaresAt confuse trick no longer works
[2:45:31] <%Shonen_hero> I really like Mementos
[2:45:31] <+Jp3g95> Atlus does give a shit
[2:45:33] <shevan123> loud gulps
[2:45:37] <%kyh9> KICK HIS ASS
[2:45:39] <+Jp3g95> cant stream past in-game date of 12/24
[2:45:40] <RedAhoge> I realy do wish these some of these mobs actually rarely kept their overworld forms in battles
[2:45:44] <%Klefth> Can you still mug THE SHIT out of Mementos bosses?
[2:45:44] <%StaceMcGate> Pulinpa trick was nerfed
[2:45:48] <valachi> P5 really is just pathetically easy, especially base P5 if you abuse Reaper during Flu Season
[2:45:48] <zenorot> SMT games are hard to figure out during the beginning but they're very easy to exploit
[2:45:48] <%kyh9> Funny enough, this guy actually has a portrait
[2:45:49] <+gustavozxd> OOOooOO are you?
[2:45:49] <+pectusumbra> I mean I think I heard that
[2:45:51] <OldManDeckardCain> it does it's just more annoying to do
[2:45:52] <%starotter70> Haggling for money gives you A LOT more now tho
[2:45:53] <WanderingSwordsman> the farming isn't worth it, they only remain confused for one turn
[2:45:53] <$RealThiele> bowl cutman
[2:45:54] <%ape_hawk> remember pat: one year no crimes
[2:45:54] <%Shonen_hero> Wow

[2:45:57] <%SilvaChariot0133> monkaS
[2:45:58] <%extradopeness> God the mementos theme is just such an easy groove to vibe to it’s probably the song you spend the most time hearing outside of battles
[2:45:58] <%Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> alrighty then....
[2:46:01] <%kyh9> Wait Anne, he has a portrait, he's an actually important character
[2:46:02] <+knowyourenemy_97> look, he got a sprite!
[2:46:03] <%StaceMcGate> I don't think enemies drop money for being confused anymore
[2:46:05] <robo_badger> Get off my property, you damn kids
[2:46:05] <+bokchoy__> oh they have portraits now?
[2:46:06] <%Piemen99> oh wow fuck this guy

[2:46:37] <%NovaKnightmare> KICK MANDARK'S ASS
[2:46:37] <%PettyFunk> I wonder how much it would take for this guy to develop a palace, he's pretty deluded.

[2:46:55] <%mister___doctor> Old Man Phantom Thief Ryuji
[2:46:55] <%weissguard> It's kinda weird that Ryuji is as mature as he is while simultaneously being super immature.
[2:46:57] <AMaidIndeed> HEE-HO!
[2:46:57] <+Greywyn00> how do you know the weakness already?
[2:46:57] <zenorot> this probably the only memtos thing that links to the overall plot

[2:48:37] <zenorot> SMT4 is a good place to start. P2 has a great story, Soul Hackers is great
[2:48:47] <TimetodiveLTX> same
[2:48:50] <RedAhoge> But Whamon
[2:48:54] <%CursedNobleman> whatever nakadashi, go back to madarame uchiwa or whatever

[2:49:03] <+gustavozxd> p2 has a great story, best in the persona series but the gameplay is just the worst
[2:49:06] <fenrirmitsuki> @leaischill Ouch... That sounds painful, man.
[2:49:07] <%ape_hawk> "can you change my diaper, mommy?"
[2:49:08] <+knowyourenemy_97> oh, you mean that guy in the shades, huh? @leaischill
[2:49:08] <Huntercd> stalking is not love
[2:49:14] <%shaidot> He also does kingdom hearts
[2:49:16] <YakumoYomi> But he's dead, tho!
[2:49:16] <$RealThiele> hey go mind rape this guy
[2:49:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @LeaIsChill that's beyond help
[2:49:22] <%weissguard> @gustavozxd It's great that he's as mature as he is at times in the game. The comic relief gets weird, what with Morgana constantly shitting on him.
[2:49:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ryuji's whole "We're gonna fix everything! Don't be a dick!" isn't him being mature and immature. It's really just Ryuji being childish.

[2:49:41] <zenorot> its an old RPG, what do you expect
[2:49:43] <YakumoYomi> Is that his purse?
[2:49:44] <+Jp3g95> Its his seed rooGasm
[2:49:51] <%mankeyfigh> REQUEST COMPLETED
[2:49:53] <%starotter70> @gustavozxd Can you imagine P2 story but with Graphics and Gameplay like this?
[2:49:55] <JoveGar> prolly
[2:49:59] <+knowyourenemy_97> Joker no swip- ahh forget it!
[2:50:04] <LeaIsChill> Yyyyep
[2:50:07] <+Arbal3st> I love these new cut-ins
[2:50:10] <%CursedNobleman> @starotter70 MORE MARA
[2:50:12] <Strider222> CASH
[2:50:13] <CuttleCrow> cash money baby
[2:50:13] <Merkensteiner> Priorities
[2:50:15] <Huntercd> CREAM
[2:50:17] <%Daxalog> So when does it all go wrong?
[2:50:17] <robo_badger> I do like cash
[2:50:21] <%s1rcuit> cash money millionaire
[2:50:23] <+gustavozxd> @starotter70 I don't want to imagine because it hurts, it would be so good atpFeelsBeardMan
[2:50:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> I want them to hurry the hell up and give more information for SMT V
[2:50:26] <valachi> @starotter70 I'd rather P2 have gameplay that isn't as easy. A good inbetween of p2's systems would be better
[2:50:28] <Admiral_PopnFresh> What actual treasure do they take from the Metaverse into the material world?
[2:50:28] <YakumoYomi> WE DEMAND CHARIOT DICK GOD
[2:50:30] <fenrirmitsuki> MonnehmonnehMONNEH!
[2:50:36] <asgard147> SourPls
[2:50:37] <zenorot> If P2 ever gets a remake I want them to keep the gameplay for the most part and do it better instead of making it a p5 clone
[2:50:40] <$RealThiele> Mara is bae
[2:50:41] <quietshun> knut
[2:50:42] <Naho_Saenoki> @starotter70 A modernized P2 that still has combo techniques would be AMAZING.
[2:50:45] <RedAhoge> Deeper!
[2:50:54] <%extradopeness> MONEY TALKS
[2:50:55] <+bluedude153> My friend played p2
[2:50:55] <+gustavozxd> @valachi p2 is easy as fuck on normal
[2:50:55] <+Grim_kraken> Cash! ScaredyCat
[2:51:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @daxalog Sometime around 120 hrs from now
[2:51:17] <+bluedude153> He got 3 dungeons in and was never was given a reason to not use default eprsonas
[2:51:19] <valachi> P2 remake would NEED Kaneko art though. No Deep Strange incidents
[2:51:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> I want them to do a modern remake of Shin Megami Tensei If...
[2:51:21] <robo_badger> P2 is easy but it's not really fun gameplay wise
[2:51:24] <%s1rcuit> @extradopeness money talks would be a great stand, and I'm pretty sure it's an acdc song
[2:51:26] <valachi> @gustavozxd exactly though, why make it even easier?
[2:51:27] <+bluedude153> They were universally better than anything you fused
[2:51:27] <+gustavozxd> p2 has like one difficult boss and it's not even the last one, every boss in that game is just a boring dps race
[2:51:30] <+ZoltanBMagnus> persona started at 3 Kappa
[2:51:33] <zenorot> Or if there's no remake, just port it to modern devices

[2:52:40] <+gladiongamestcg2> I wish they allowed all teammates to have sub personas like in PQ 1 & 2 That cover their weeknesses or just help.
[2:52:41] <sharkboss1> they buffed him.
[2:52:49] <%J_Papa> omg so we have to fight him legit, oh my
[2:52:56] <YakumoYomi> @zenorot They tried that with the PSP, and the P1/P2 "remakes" weren't well received.
[2:52:57] <Explodincatz> "just dodge trains lol"
[2:52:59] <sharkboss1> no cheesin the Reaper
[2:53:00] <+gustavozxd> @valachi well, balancing could be fixed, but the controls and mechanics in persona 5 are just really fun
[2:53:05] <This_is_Marco> Does the confusion money trick work on memento bosses?
[2:53:11] <%s1rcuit> CAN you fight the reaper legit?
[2:53:12] <%Divryne> The Reaper is coronavirus.
[2:53:12] <%j0ustar> It's alright just suplex the train if you have to
[2:53:14] <+Jp3g95> time for some shit
[2:53:16] <zenorot> A game and how its played should be able to stand the test of time
[2:53:17] <OldManDeckardCain> joker couldn't even dodge a chalk LUL
[2:53:18] <%dukenux> that looks like SH3 subway
[2:53:22] <This_is_Marco> FeelsBadMan
[2:53:24] <shevan123> oh yeah this area looks so cool
[2:53:27] <archnme> it works on specific ones
[2:53:28] <%J_Papa> how am i supposed to afford my perfect roster of lvl 99 top-tier personas?
[2:53:31] <broostmonkey> just let your whole team change personas like the older ones
[2:53:37] <$RealThiele> chaos wall
[2:53:46] <bakkatohri> Confusion trick was the only thing that ever gave you the power to full customize personas the way you wanted without spending massive amounts of time grinding ; w ;
[2:53:48] <fenrirmitsuki> Hey, does your save file from vanilla P5 transfer over; as in your compendium and money for NG+?
[2:53:50] <BabyNaBackbrace> an unsuccessful title on PSP? Totally not the fault of it being on PSP!

[3:23:56] <+pectusumbra> If I remember right you get knowledge and S-link
[3:23:57] <%NopeBadguy> studying together gives you s link points and knowledge, but won't advance your rank
[3:23:58] <+projectmanatees> one guy
[3:23:58] <transporterthesequel> BAI BITCH
[3:24:02] <Run44forrest> thats bonkin

[3:24:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> go rub up on those Ann titters
[3:24:20] <cumurasame> @PatStaresAt TBH I put off Chihaya and Ohya's links a bit too long and forgot Ryuji for some reason won't hang out a lot of times unless you've dealt with the palace first. So by the time I was using Chihaya to boost everyones links, I was still off Ryuji by 2 ranks. I did actually max out the social stats super early though. To the point I was mad that I got useless points for like 6 months of the game.
[3:24:21] <heartlesshealer> it's not a rank up event, but gives you rank up points
[3:24:23] <$RealThiele> anatomy time
[3:24:34] <%Dragon_Batman> Studying with friends is usually a good idea
[3:24:37] <shevan123> pats being a huge playboy

[3:53:27] <+NitronStreams> I cant believe Aizen was evil
[3:53:28] <errasos> you need to rank up him, goro and the other new one
[3:53:28] <Xodious987> what tarot does he represent?
[3:53:29] <clintonificent> he's hot so he can be morally grey!
[3:53:30] <StaceMcGate> goddammit, he is some evil god isn't he?
[3:53:32] <+knowyourenemy_97> Snakes-san
[3:53:33] <+KorotiniNotlad> He looks like pre-asshole Aizen from BLeach
[3:53:33] <valachi> @Mr_Pylon u-uh huh yeah that'd be d-dumb if it happened...

[4:10:43] <%senatorarmstrong_2020> senatorarmstrong_2020 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! boop beep
[4:10:44] <zenith0111> SMT IS ALWAYS HARD
[4:10:45] <%tumzfestival> HORD
[4:10:46] <+broth_elemental> how are they even going to play Golden, pat
[4:10:49] <%ExpressNode> SMT IV is a hurdle in the beginning but it gets super ass easy during mid and end game
[4:10:49] <broostmonkey> FUCKED IN THE ASS BY MINOTAUR
[4:10:50] <filialpails> SMT NINE
[4:10:50] <%AllenDeadman> I'd say DDS is a good entry point
[4:10:52] <heartlesshealer> Raidou Kuzunoha vs The Soulless Army
[4:10:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Start with Strange Journey, like I did :)
[4:10:55] <gekizenbu> VITA MEANS DEATH
[4:10:56] <CountFitzwilliam> get gud
[4:10:57] <%CaptainDonk> SMT starts at Strange Journey
[4:10:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> NOCTURNE
[4:10:59] <+pectusumbra> Is it? I feel like I got huge in that super fast, got lost and then stopped caring
[4:11:04] <+broth_elemental> Golden doesn't even exist anymore
[4:11:08] <%the38bandit> Where's SMT on Switch?
[4:11:08] <+snugglepuggs> SMT 4 A is easier
[4:11:09] <%NopeBadguy> SMT4 stops being hard after Medusa TBH
[4:11:11] <%j0ustar> Pat says" Buy a Vita for one game!"
[4:11:19] <bimjojo> maybe play a Persona, then Nocturne? thats what I did, and it went smoothly
[4:11:24] <+pectusumbra> Also if you have a 3DS, the Devil Survivor games are great
[4:11:32] <%SirGO0SE> hi im chat
[4:11:35] <%Nobrev> I got my vita for like 40 bucks at a local game resale store
[4:11:37] <heartlesshealer> or you can hate yourself and start with Persona 3 FES: The Answer
[4:11:40] <%DakotaMacDoodle> DakotaMacDoodle gifted a Tier 1 sub to Valentinius_Anodyne! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[4:11:46] <%tumzfestival> no life gang
[4:11:46] <CurrySauseBandit> Don't even need to nolife it though. :|
[4:11:48] <%neroforte177> is it like grindy hard or like it actually takes thought
[4:11:52] <%zamzoph> @j0ustar I have a Vita TV for just that. Would've been Ultra Despair Girls, too, but that ended up coming out on PC
[4:11:54] <%BoomerUnchained> psaGib
[4:11:55] <YakumoYomi> A lot of games just buff enemies and/or nerf the player at higher difficulties.
[4:11:56] <zenith0111> @bimjojo I played Nocturne first and I think it made me really not care for persona even after beating P5
[4:12:14] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea they are
[4:12:15] <Aydarkzero> i'm neutral towards Persona
[4:12:16] <%suikudo> I will NUT on her legs!!!!
