[0:05:03] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @Koopardon You gotta flip the house and defeat the sins of your past. Choose between post modern and your own soul.

[1:18:53] <+Rigmarole111> psaDogchamp
[1:18:54] <+Teintstein> @Sunstalker do you know if it's actually because they googled "four seasons" and didn't check that it was the hotel?
[1:19:02] <NephiStreams> is he taking a quick break chat?
[1:19:05] <%derpumpkinking> Has Pat touched Visage before?
[1:19:06] <derekwst3> @PeachSaliva you might like the game Penko park, its similar to pokemon snap
[1:19:08] <%Ninestempest> Ninestempest subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months, currently on a 38 month streak! I just got in during the break, what happened for the first 1 hour and 18 minutes?!?!?!
[1:19:15] <%yves_is_online> sshit these watermelon white claw bootlegs are hitting SourPls
[1:19:16] <$happyface699> Hes gotta empty his balls
[1:19:17] <$joylent_blue> NephiStreams dog had to pee yea
[1:19:17] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> @peachsaliva We genuinely dig the pregame. No such thing as too much. And now we have Binky Dick lore. So glad you're home and moving in the right direction psaUp
[1:19:19] <+SmoochSpider> @nephistreams peepee break
[1:19:20] <$happyface699> Pee is stored there
[1:19:27] <Sunstalker> Teintstein They got refused by the hotel and someone fucked up scheduling a different 4 seasons place
[1:19:28] <%Hiro01231> psaCanada_SG This is beautiful
[1:19:31] <%Ninestempest> didn't they do a visage play in a shitstorm?
[1:19:34] <+a_c_chirns> ah fuck I ate too much candy and now my tummy hurt
[1:19:35] <NephiStreams> oki doki, thank you <3 @joylent_blue @SmoochSpider
[1:19:38] <Skatedeandre> the four seasons thing sounds like a Nathan for you scheme
[1:19:40] <%Captainahab_37> pee makes the skin soft and healthy if you don't pee
[1:19:41] <$happyface699> Pee is stored in the balls, by design
[1:19:45] <%Captainahab_37> that's a fact
[1:19:56] <%Laecerelius> Yeah they played an early build during the last Shitstorm
[1:19:58] <%Teintstein> @Sunstalker fuck yes
[1:20:01] <$happyface699> True fact
[1:20:02] <$joylent_blue> Ninestempest yes but it was really early in its development
[1:20:05] <%honeyman18> Howdy
[1:20:10] <%Captainahab_37> Visage more like Pissage
[1:20:11] <%derpumpkinking> They might have, but I think it was still a really early access when they did.
[1:20:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Remember when Pat, Peach and Eli had a 3-4 hour stream where they talked about nothing, but Korone memes and Furry barges and it was one of the most viewed streams on the channel?
[1:20:18] <heart_ablaze> @ninestempest they played the demo, this is the full game
[1:20:24] <%TallYoda08> SourPls
[1:20:27] <+a_c_chirns> justaviPepecry Shitstorm
[1:20:27] <Sunstalker> The 4 seasons thing feels like shooting new scenes for Borat 2 but the Extended Cut LUL
[1:20:30] <%Jaxiis0> they did play it on shitstorm but let's be real, Pat probably forgot enough about it that this'll be as good as a first playthrough
[1:20:31] <%Ninestempest> Right, I think he mentioned tha ton the podcast. How much have they played of it tonight?
[1:20:36] <%Laecerelius> Man! We need more 3P podcasts!
[1:20:37] <%Teintstein> @Sunstalker I guess that's what happens when the only people you can get to work for you are neocon ghouls in their 80s or like 19 year olds who dropped out of Liberty University
[1:20:45] <%weissguard> eekum bokum
[1:20:47] <$happyface699> Pats gonna get spooked
[1:20:54] <%Captainahab_37> a horror game in early access seems weird to me idk

[1:33:02] <AFlyingTaco1> The devs deliberately said that the game is PT-inspired, so yes, it looks like PT.
[1:33:04] <%ChestMimik> @tranquilturnip PT doesn't exist, right Konami?

[1:33:29] <TikanZK> hey i have that rug
[1:33:29] <%Tyonidus> Yo Pat if you see this, how old were you when you found out about your sleep issues and did you/do you have other throat issues too? I'm 24 and starting to get worried because everybody says I'm snoring a lot and VERY loudly, and every time I eat, after I get done, I feel like I have to clear my throat a million times, which is weird.

[2:33:35] <+Sebenoth> breaking a mirror should make a splorch noise
[2:33:35] <%sumrand0> Because Paige is on an inverse functionality scale: normal actions are difficult but when she's in a disadvantaged situation her power increases to boost her competence. She's channeling her Werewolf power!
[2:33:37] <natebud> Mannequins are scary: check

[2:41:33] <thelonechris> I think the game died
[2:41:33] <%coreyyotto> which is kind of appropriate

[2:41:35] <DukeBlack_> so it was inspired by Silent hill
[2:41:37] <%walternatorz> this is paige in 20 years when she's looking for McDonalds

[3:44:19] <Chatterbox1991> Crowbar
[3:44:19] <Darkfire346> maybe it was meds and she thought it was poison
[3:44:25] <$RealThiele> or she just assumed he was when he made tea nd killed him
[3:44:25] <DashXero> Maybe she caught him on the ONE time he actually did try to poison her.
[3:44:25] <lunacys_straightjacket> I mean she was apparently delusional slas well so....that's why I asked

[4:25:00] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt i conceed that some of the progression in this game is a little obtuse in this chapter and the final chapter, the other two are more straightforward

[4:37:02] <indig0bird> this was hard to watch, mostly because I'm a huge pussy
[4:37:20] <$RealThiele> the peephole potential made me squik
[4:37:24] <valgaldur> I hope payed the Visage devs to stream this game.

[4:37:25] <%WhereIsWill> i noticed they got rid of that candle puzzle. good, that was awful
[4:37:30] <dots4eyes> It didn't help that Paige was high...I think her screaming freaked him out a little more than usual
[4:37:51] <portiagatim> And the raqua take u to the hospital the most difficult
[4:37:59] <%honeyman18> well I spent the night screaming at old ladies
[4:38:04] <+zeraux_> i feel exhausted just watching holy fuck
[4:38:24] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[4:38:28] <%sleepers1mulant> That chapter was something else
[4:38:29] <DukeBlack_> @dots4eyes Paige barely screamed.
[4:38:30] <%Prosewalters> Prosewalters subscribed with Prime.

[4:40:25] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt in order to unlock the ending you basically have to collect VHS tapes around the house tat send you on other fetch questy type stuff to unlock pieces of a mask to unlock the actual ending
[4:40:27] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Paige will u be playing visage next time cause pat is a baby man?

[4:40:41] <%Livelinne> ahoy
[4:40:43] <$RealThiele> you did it
[4:40:45] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> What's the lore behind Emlo being called PeePee, chat?
[4:40:50] <+Punchasaur> MOAR
[4:40:50] <cholesteroid> howdy
[4:40:53] <Uselesswhitenoise> to unlock ending
[4:40:53] <natebud> And the moral of the story is that schizophrenia is bad.
[4:40:53] <justinjones1989> you gotta finish it Patty
[4:40:53] <%mikessdd> hry
[4:40:54] <+zeraux_> its over now pat you can breathe
[4:40:54] <%mike2hands> You k bud?
[4:40:56] <Uselesswhitenoise> watch yotuube

[4:41:01] <Saltmeisterr> cuz he pee
[4:41:02] <%josstyl_0> then become vampire
[4:41:06] <huskarl_zap> @buttstuff_n_coffeepots he pee
[4:41:08] <AFlyingTaco1> Is Paige gonna continue this spooks?
[4:41:08] <%BoxNavy> looks like 3
[4:41:10] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Ah
[4:41:11] <%anubisque> at least do chapter 1
[4:41:13] <%Monkeyweed21> Hows your butt
[4:41:15] <%BoxNavy> maybe 4
[4:41:15] <%anubisque> it's MUCH shorter and super cool
[4:41:16] <%Livelinne> do iiiiiit pleeeeaaase BegWan
[4:41:17] <%DianaTheAscian> did paige go to bed?
[4:41:19] <Chatterbox1991> 3 plus the mid chapter finale
[4:41:20] <$RealThiele> spine growing
[4:41:21] <rosysyntax> You should totally play the rest.
[4:41:21] <%mikessdd> this has been a hell of a stream from pat the coward
[4:41:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> @buttstuff_n_coffeepots he was covered in piss when he adopted Paige
[4:41:22] <+zeraux_> pat looks visibly tired
[4:41:24] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> 3 or 4 I hear
[4:41:25] <AFlyingTaco1> @anubisque He did
[4:41:27] <%anubisque> chapter 3 is meh, but chapter 1 is worth seeing
[4:41:35] <Uselesswhitenoise> Pat pretend to play it by streaming a youtube longplay
[4:41:52] <natebud> Chapter 1 does some interesting stuff. Worth playing over Chapter 2
[4:41:52] <+secretspud> PANDA
[4:41:53] <Zeldrick> Maybe space out each chapter playthrough?
[4:41:57] <%anubisque> lucy/chapter 1 is amazing
[4:41:57] <chimeraxmachina> I only got distracted for 10 minutes in the middle and i feel like the entire story went over my head
[4:41:57] <%Monkeyweed21> you can do them in any order @PatStaresAt
[4:41:58] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Cool, thanks chat and @rumtumtugnutz doodGood
[4:41:58] <%CancerCarp> stupid horror puzzles are dum
[4:42:03] <$RealThiele> yea its kinda shit
[4:42:04] <%anubisque> rakan/3 is kinda bad
[4:42:09] <AFlyingTaco1> So wait, which one is Dolores' chapter?
[4:42:12] <+Punchasaur> knock knock
[4:42:14] <%anubisque> do lucy- you won't regret it
[4:42:18] <%Maids4lyfe> 4
[4:42:28] <%maybefalco> gun
[4:42:32] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt you can probably do Rakan and Lucy much more easily; Dolores and Chapter 4 are a lot more obtuse and you basically need chat to help you
[4:42:32] <natebud> Is chapter 3 worse than 2? @anubisque
[4:42:33] <+secretspud> loads pistol with malicous intent
[4:42:35] <$RealThiele> the happy gun
[4:42:43] <%anubisque> 3 is an outlast level
[4:42:43] <%Verd_254> Verd_254 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[4:42:47] <%anubisque> 1 is unique and cool
[4:42:49] <AFlyingTaco1> Wait, are these potential spoilers?
[4:42:50] <natebud> ugh
[4:42:52] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeyeye
[4:42:53] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Crutch was kinda lame imo
[4:42:55] <Old_tac0> too spooky
[4:42:56] <Uselesswhitenoise> do it next halloween
[4:42:56] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> work yourself up to it
[4:43:01] <Uselesswhitenoise> a chapter a year
[4:43:03] <$RealThiele> DEW IT
[4:43:05] <Chatterbox1991> Pagie dead?
[4:43:05] <%WhereIsWill> this game is a SOUL drainer
[4:43:07] <%josstyl_0> too spooped
[4:43:11] <%Monkeyweed21> need that colostomy bag first
[4:43:12] <%anubisque> lucy chapter pls
[4:43:12] <natebud> First chapter is worth it, every chapter after that, who knows
[4:43:12] <%ghostofsolomon> have you ordered a ps5
[4:43:13] <rosysyntax> There's a Silent Hill 4 easter egg that is super good
[4:43:13] <%DKDiamantes> You look beat dude
[4:43:14] <%anubisque> its so good
[4:43:15] <+zeraux_> rest up pat
[4:43:15] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> do it coward
[4:43:16] <%honeyman18> psaSkelmo
[4:43:17] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> the game is interesting
[4:43:17] <johnatella> yeah that was a lot pat.
[4:43:18] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Just have Paige there for emotional support
[4:43:20] <%Broand> Boo!
[4:43:20] <Zeldrick> Give it time :)
[4:43:20] <$RealThiele> once a month?
[4:43:20] <Chatterbox1991> chapter 1 and 3 are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay easier
[4:43:22] <%CopperTucker> Many more spooks, we're here for you!
[4:43:23] <%luftraumm1> are you backing out?
[4:43:29] <Uselesswhitenoise> have Plague do it while you watch
[4:43:32] <%anubisque> chapter 1 is probably scarier than what you just did, too
[4:43:34] <johnatella> this game is a lot it okay to be anxious about this one
[4:43:35] <%anubisque> but more straightforward
[4:43:37] <%sleepers1mulant> Def take it in bite size pieces
[4:43:41] <+Punchasaur> defeat those bitch ass ghosts
[4:43:42] <+democrazyyy> the mirrors arent in chapter 1
[4:43:42] <%Agami23> i think that means the game succeded
[4:43:43] <%josstyl_0> why?
[4:43:43] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Spoopy Pat gettin spooped
[4:43:44] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt Just make Paige play it for you :D
[4:43:49] <%CopperTucker> Paige can do it while you cry, just like PT
[4:43:49] <%anubisque> 1 is more linear
[4:43:51] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm fine with that
[4:43:53] <%anubisque> but also scarier
[4:43:53] <%BoxNavy> ok :)
[4:43:54] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> yeah do that
[4:43:55] <%XeroSigmaPrime> YES
[4:43:56] <Saltmeisterr> that works
[4:43:57] <Uselesswhitenoise> better or worse streeor than pathologic
[4:43:57] <AFlyingTaco1> YEYEYEYE
[4:44:00] <$RealThiele> fair
[4:44:00] <%DianaTheAscian> yay
[4:44:01] <%ssjklyco> Pat Scares At
[4:44:02] <+zeraux_> sounds like a plan
[4:44:02] <natebud> You dont need to worry about inventory management at all. I beat the first two chapters game wihout using a single pill.
[4:44:02] <%josstyl_0> What was scary about the mirrors?
[4:44:03] <%Monkeyweed21> Do it whenever Paige is giving you shit
[4:44:03] <BakerBrute> Yeah, you gotta pace yourself
[4:44:04] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> What freaks you out about it @PatStaresAt ?
[4:44:04] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt did you have a good time, pat? :)
[4:44:07] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Game is good tho right?
[4:44:08] <Zeldrick> That's cool
[4:44:10] <%DKDiamantes> All of it compiled together makes it a fucking stress fest
[4:44:13] <%luftraumm1> did it beat your anal fortitude?
[4:44:14] <%sleepers1mulant> psaUp
[4:44:15] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> pace yourself, self care and shit
[4:44:18] <%BoxNavy> we saw :)
[4:44:20] <+StabbyDabbi> lucy is way easy
[4:44:21] <@PeachSaliva> Big thanks to u @chatterbox1991
[4:44:21] <$Falilth> looks like more time for yakuzi
[4:44:22] <%Livelinne> oof

[4:44:48] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> what a cute hiccup
[4:44:49] <%Ninestempest> yakuza 7 is the turn based one right?
[4:44:58] <+Phantomjay> i thought you got backups?
[4:44:59] <Chatterbox1991> @PeachSaliva you are quite welcome :)
[4:44:59] <Saltmeisterr> ye
[4:45:01] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> i just finished playing GRIS for the first time, holy cow that is a beautiful game
[4:45:02] <%Ninestempest> when does that happen
[4:45:15] <%BoxNavy> Jebaited
[4:45:16] <Saltmeisterr> ????
[4:45:21] <%josstyl_0> good night
[4:45:24] <%sleepers1mulant> sleepers1mulant gifted a Tier 1 sub to Chatterbox1991! They have given 2 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[4:45:26] <Saltmeisterr> ok then
[4:45:27] <+zeraux_> he is the storm that is approaching
[4:45:30] <$RealThiele> dog chili
[4:45:30] <AFlyingTaco1> Gief already ate it though
[4:45:38] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Pat, is the first thing you'll do with your PS5 to lay it upon your upper torso?
[4:45:40] <$Falilth> @AFlyingTaco1 the cool thing is yes. the extra cool thing is if you get the xbox version you get it on xbox one / serries s and x and phone and pc with cross saves
[4:45:45] <%Chatterbox1991> @sleepers1mulant Thanks for the gift sub!
[4:46:00] <Uselesswhitenoise> never pay for anything
[4:46:03] <%Chatterbox1991> CohhCarnage played this like a week ago and he also needed chat to guide his hips a bunch, mostly on the 4th chapter @PeachSaliva
[4:46:04] <Uselesswhitenoise> not even cars or drugs
[4:46:08] <Uselesswhitenoise> just steal them
[4:46:12] <%sleepers1mulant> @chatterbox1991 thanks for being a huge help
[4:46:14] <%Monkeyweed21> dont be a shit, pay for the games you play
[4:46:15] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, sounds a bit scummy dat guy
[4:46:17] <AFlyingTaco1> @Falilth That's pretty cool. Surprising too.
[4:46:19] <$RealThiele> warhammer baifus
[4:46:27] <+PatchworkSquid> welp. i just bought visage
[4:46:31] <promessav2> i have to hate the companies i love pat
[4:46:31] <Uselesswhitenoise> or forigne
[4:46:32] <%AnIrishPapaya> psaDab psaDab psaDab
[4:46:42] <natebud> piracy is back in
[4:46:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Piracy is when you cant access the game mostly
[4:46:43] <$Falilth> @PatStaresAt OR if the dev's are scumbags
[4:46:44] <+zeraux_> or if its not available in your country
[4:46:48] <%Agami23> pat you hear about little hope?
[4:46:48] <%ssjklyco> Or it's not available anywhere
[4:46:48] <Saltmeisterr> or the company is a shit
[4:46:50] <%BoxNavy> or if its a triple A game
[4:46:51] <Uselesswhitenoise> piarcy is fun
[4:46:53] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> @PatchworkSquid same thing happened to me LUL
[4:47:00] <%Chatterbox1991> @sleepers1mulant you are quite welcome, this was super duper fun
[4:47:04] <%JobbedBone> as we get into more of a service economy, it becomes clear that money is voting, not always just for product
[4:47:05] <%Emperor_Machinus> or youi are a pirate
[4:47:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> there's not really any way to justify piracy if you can get it legally.
[4:47:08] <%Koopardon> OR if buying it gives money to Didney
[4:47:15] <%cvp5127> and spite
[4:47:28] <%sleepers1mulant> @chatterbox1991 psaUp <3
[4:47:29] <$RealThiele> Mandopiratin
[4:47:45] <AFlyingTaco1> Which one?
[4:47:49] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @rumtumtugnutz Exactly, thats why piracy is an accessibility issue
[4:48:17] <%Chatterbox1991> @sleepers1mulant <3 <3 <3
[4:48:22] <%Monkeyweed21> As someone that worked in a government office, the workers hate it just as much as you
[4:48:23] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> so many ghosts
[4:48:26] <%Aleate> Yeah man fuck this house
[4:48:30] <%SomeSageAdvice> yeah sure, i will be more than happy to give a scalper 500 dollars i dont have for a game that is no longer in production @rumtumtugnutz
[4:48:32] <AFlyingTaco1> Yeah, like goddamn. This is an entirely different game now.
[4:48:32] <johnatella> super fucking haunted
[4:48:33] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> spooky ghost, house retail.
[4:48:34] <%blue8moon> but didn't he murder people in the beginning?
[4:48:34] <%Dementedpenguin> House sucks.
[4:48:38] <natebud> probably.
[4:48:40] <%BoxNavy> what if it was a ghost who did it
[4:48:40] <$RealThiele> burn it for the insurance money
[4:48:41] <%ssjklyco> It was a Visage
[4:48:42] <+Punchasaur> i think hes dead
[4:48:42] <+blink289> those pills are prescribed to him
[4:48:49] <Uselesswhitenoise> would owning a house be more fun if it was haunted
[4:48:53] <%CordwoodMather> CordwoodMather subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[4:48:54] <%tank7013> It's an indie horror game it's like 99% he's the killer
[4:48:56] <%Monkeyweed21> I would legit rather work in retail than for the DMV or City Hall
[4:49:03] <Uselesswhitenoise> would you pay extra for a ghost house
[4:49:06] <natebud> Seems like everyone in the house go crazy
[4:49:10] <%Chatterbox1991> Ftr i have a theory on what actually happens with the story if you want to hear about it when and if Pat beats this @PeachSaliva @PatStaresAt
[4:49:12] <%Typhaeon> Stabbing relief
[4:49:14] <valgaldur> Are they they 420 pills?
[4:49:17] <%Emperor_Machinus> You would also be stressed in that house
[4:49:17] <$RealThiele> serenity now?
[4:49:23] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Pat, we see Dwayne kill himself in the opening cutscene
[4:49:24] <+Punchasaur> seems like he's in hell
[4:49:26] <%BoxNavy> Penis
[4:49:29] <+Punchasaur> a la PT
[4:49:29] <huskarl_zap> LUL
[4:49:39] <$RealThiele> penis club
[4:49:41] <AFlyingTaco1> Bruh
[4:49:49] <%Typhaeon> Moving the needle on that poll brother
[4:49:49] <huskarl_zap> SnooPINGAS as usual i see
[4:49:50] <%ssjklyco> Counter donations
[4:49:54] <%Typhaeon> Who the hell doesn't want to see Yakoozies
[4:49:59] <%SvenHolgersson> Welp going to bed night Binky Dick Pat
[4:50:00] <%Monkeyweed21> Half of all donations go to paying off the debts of the Pat campaign
[4:50:02] <%Agami23> i hope they get some of the old dub cast back, but i doubt it because mark hammil would probably be expensive
[4:50:12] <%AzureGale> Yes
[4:50:20] <chimeraxmachina> I hoped the mechanic being build around mirrors would have thematic meaning since the player had no reflection but I guess that was more of a technical decision
[4:50:25] <%Agami23> mysterious fox.
[4:50:27] <%cvp5127> chihaya
[4:50:42] <%Ranryu692> yeah
[4:50:42] <+Draco_Renegade> yip yip
[4:50:45] <%Aleate> Aleate subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 24 month streak! Hi Pat. I hope you and Paige are doing well. Thats all I really have to say boyoLOVE
[4:50:51] <$RealThiele> free ethers is huge
[4:50:52] <%Ranryu692> it is
[4:51:04] <%Agami23> all your yen yip yip yap
[4:51:20] <%MajorCrasher> Rise is mandatory I'd say
[4:51:24] <%trustycoyote> What's his face, blonde kid
[4:51:26] <AnActualHermitCrab> Mysterious Fox, and your party members. I
[4:51:29] <AnActualHermitCrab> I'd say.
[4:51:35] <%ssjklyco> That fight in that game is great
[4:51:40] <+Dova573> Who cares about gameplay bonuses I WANT MY WIFUS
[4:51:45] <Profmcstevie> That's a big juicy steak and you savour every chew
[4:51:46] <+Dova573> Kappa
[4:51:47] <%Agami23> was obvious badguy a badguy?
[4:51:49] <%AzureGale> Snape was the name of the sled
[4:51:51] <+Punchasaur> chihaya a cute
[4:51:56] <Thirtine> Kappa
[4:51:59] <%CopperTucker> you can't pay me enough to give a shit about Akechi
[4:52:01] <%Aleate> The kitchen saw Pats balls
[4:52:02] <%honeyman18> fanfiction spoiled the plot for me
[4:52:13] <%trustycoyote> Yo that kitchen scene was legit Evil Dead. 100%
[4:52:13] <AFlyingTaco1> That's a victory
[4:52:13] <%AzureGale> Persona 5 Arena when
[4:52:20] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah Woolie
[4:52:22] <natebud> The first room spoiled the plot for me.
[4:52:25] <%BoxNavy> dumb but successful
[4:52:29] <+zeraux_> but shes very pretty
[4:52:31] <%Emperor_Machinus> cheap glass
[4:52:36] <%ssjklyco> If pats dumb and got a house and all that, what that say about your friend?:
[4:52:40] <+TatsuMakuu> stream ending?
[4:52:42] <DXLelouch24> Like Trump Supporters
