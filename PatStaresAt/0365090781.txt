[1:02:44] <%AbnormalVoid> Yaoi Guy
[1:02:46] <Gruhunchously> He ran into the gecko's line of sight and tried to defend himself.
[1:02:49] <Naho_Saenoki> Hello weird eyeball people.

[1:05:12] <Redchimera45> What happened to that 12.5 smg?
[1:05:12] <orcstr16> I wish the legion was less shitty as a faction because I think the legion's design is really interesting for this setting, but everything about the legion's presentation, ideals, and leaders results in them being pieces of shit. (basically just upgraded raiders)
[1:05:13] <Firesparks> use the garand

[1:09:51] <deviljhojho94> just like the boomers
[1:09:51] <alrobot2014> they definitely did
[1:09:54] <indig0bird> That's Chris' vault
[1:09:59] <godlesscruelty> Mercy kill!
[1:10:02] <+Swaggamanca> This place was stuffed with guns after all
[1:10:03] <Gruhunchously> I can't remember the backstory of this vault, but in probably involved a gunfight.
[1:10:05] <+Skatedeandre> Bruce’s patented gamer goo
[1:10:06] <%TheSpiritof2277> @Parapattern I get you. They all more or less become fodder when you get to the military base
[1:10:09] <dekkitout> "DID YOU REALLY THINK IT WOULD BE THIS EASY?!" -Vay Hek
[1:10:13] <%Skeletorexplains> Gamer Gel.
[1:10:20] <CuttleCrow> GUN FIST
[1:10:21] <JittersCaffeine> Isn't this the vault the Boomers came from?
[1:10:26] <deviljhojho94> yeah
[1:10:28] <Gruhunchously> Yeah
[1:10:29] <%LogothX> Can you spec your player character to gun fist?
[1:10:38] <madpuppy2424> Are you going to watch the mk event tomorrow pat?
[1:10:40] <Glassbrain> Veronic
[1:10:41] <alrobot2014> yep its also where Chris Haversam came from
[1:10:43] <Gruhunchously> The Boomers left before things went to hell here.
[1:10:44] <%LocDogX86X> yeah this was the Boomer vault
[1:10:56] <+ogrest> @Skatedeandre the odds of that being a thing increase exponentially as we tamper with the human genome and enter the realm of genetic code becoming a patentable thing
[1:11:03] <Gruhunchously> What was that?
[1:11:11] <Gruhunchously> Do the ghouls have grenades?
[1:11:13] <deviljhojho94> this vault was chock full of 30 year old boomers
[1:11:14] <%LogothX> Also, what's so special about this vault?
[1:11:14] <+Grayhammatter> wait, was that a mine?
[1:11:14] <Glassbrain> I find fallout NV is more satisfying with a melee build
[1:11:15] <JittersCaffeine> The explosions?
[1:11:20] <alrobot2014> that's a byproduct of the twostep goodbye @AngriestPat
[1:11:20] <Glassbrain> baseball bats are GOOD
[1:11:20] <Finakala> Veronica upgraded to Bombfist
[1:11:22] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat Two Step goodbye turn Crit kills into frag mines rooPog

[1:11:25] <edfiggz> Has he done any of the dlcs?
[1:11:28] <deviljhojho94> Melee is way powerful in new vegas

[1:11:33] <CuttleCrow> melee? what you're looking for is unarmed
[1:11:43] <krymzen5> huh
[1:11:44] <Gruhunchously> Melee is crazy overpowered in this game
[1:11:46] <+miguelrod777> beep book fuck the ghouls
[1:11:47] <deviljhojho94> Only melee benefits from elijahs ramblings tho
[1:11:48] <JittersCaffeine> This vault sucks

[1:12:53] <digaogrunge> not fancy enough
[1:12:54] <%LocDogX86X> the right dress gets her super excited
[1:12:54] <orcstr16> I wish that in one of the fallout games you could get a companion that would take everything you give them, some of the loot in the dungeon, and abandon you like most people in these settings would.

[1:13:00] <suikudo> @AngriestPat If you use a better dress she says something more
[1:13:02] <%OwlLightningMage> You guys totally forgot how this works LUL
[1:13:04] <+Ciphris> chat wanted her to have the sexy one
[1:13:05] <Conky89> She never will. Because her base clothing provides more defense than the dress lol.
[1:13:07] <%PenmanLupine> I gave Veronica the Vera Keys dress
[1:13:07] <Gruhunchously> Okay, but if you give her a White Glove Society dress she teaches you a special melee move.
[1:13:07] <+DUCKKILLER> hello shit lord love you longtime <3
[1:13:10] <Lulu19> chat is retarded
[1:13:11] <indig0bird> The Dead Money dress is the best looking in the game, also magically transforms into a tux!

[1:13:46] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat You need that autodoc to save Ceasar rooREE
[1:13:53] <%PaladinDupre> DEAD MONEY has the best DRESS
[1:13:56] <Gruhunchously> I never found this safe the first time I went to this vault. It would have made things easier.
[1:13:58] <FracturedImage> Fuck Ceasar tho
[1:14:00] <CuttleCrow> Pat saving Caesar LUL
[1:14:00] <$Tuskor13> is the stream fucking DYING for anyone else or is my computer fucking dying

[1:14:05] <deviljhojho94> I will fuck cacesar in the ass
[1:14:09] <%ThatGuyfromMars> dead money has the dress that becomes a tux
[1:14:12] <jobbedbone> stream is fine
[1:14:17] <%ThatGuyfromMars> its reversible
[1:14:18] <Gruhunchously> Oh yeah, you can get here to save Caesar. So worth it.

[1:14:51] <VeryTricky> pat youre too huge
[1:14:54] <%pectusumbra> no he picked up plenty, I think he probably stopped since he doesn't really need the caps anymore
[1:14:56] <JittersCaffeine> I can't believe Veronica will never get the true fancy dress now
[1:14:59] <deviljhojho94> @SGrim I will be the first to admit that he is oddly handsome for a wastelander
[1:14:59] <+InugamiTheHound> pat used his dead eye
[1:15:09] <%roxikat> He has become giant
[1:15:10] <%kiiiirsten> Austin Powers? He's the snake to my mongoose. Or the mongoose to my snake. Either way it's bad.
[1:15:11] <zafooru> but what if they needed it later
[1:15:12] <bogan1998> gotta save it for later
[1:15:12] <Glassbrain> the rad-away wasn't gonna help em.
[1:15:20] <JittersCaffeine> Rad Away probably doesn't do much with a full blown reactor leak
[1:15:21] <Glassbrain> delaying the inevitable.
[1:15:23] <Cloudy_TV> Fuck I forgot the ghouls talk in this game
[1:15:24] <$SGrim> @deviljhojho94 I got that from you saying how you wanted to fuck him in the ass rooGasm
[1:15:27] <%TheSpiritof2277> Now we really have to pray he does Dead Money for the ACTUAL dress
[1:15:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> That face
[1:15:28] <Glassbrain> at BEST.
[1:15:28] <Gruhunchously> The ghouls sometimes speak broken English. It's freaky.
[1:15:30] <%Typhaeon> That was a good Pat face
[1:15:30] <jobbedbone> is this whole level a political statement about gun control?
[1:15:30] <%valriot> apatWhat apatWhat
[1:15:31] <+ogrest> @Gruhunchously I dunno man, I feel like the comedic stylings of three amigos 2278 are much less enjoyable than their 1980s era predecessors, also where are the sombreros?

[1:21:04] <krewl123> ghoul are my fav to kill in fallout
[1:21:08] <deviljhojho94> @SGrim Goddammit. I should probably just sell out and become one of those hand cam-whores
[1:21:10] <jiffyrustle> ;5595265

[1:23:24] <Gruhunchously> Oh yeah, there's a tacked on quest right at the end.
[1:23:25] <Mr_Strut> KILL THEM
[1:23:25] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat it's for a side quest to either stop the reactor leak to save farms, or leave a family trapped to starve in another part of the vault
[1:23:27] <ScreamingMeat> KILL THEM ALL
[1:23:27] <indig0bird> Save them
[1:23:29] <ahbhajit> what tick on the rad meter gives you cancer?
[1:23:30] <%ThatGuyfromMars> instead of poop in the pool, there's a bomv
[1:23:30] <%Typhaeon> They're not real

[1:23:39] <FracturedImage> save the farm
[1:23:41] <%LogothX> AW NO! The corn! Paul Newman's gonna have my legs broke...
[1:23:42] <%TheSpiritof2277> They don't exist if you can't see them apatSmug

[1:23:48] <%OwlLightningMage> I completely forgot about this LUL
[1:23:48] <indig0bird> Can I spoiler?
[1:23:49] <evbites> farms
[1:23:51] <%PaladinDupre> TERMINAL
[1:23:53] <Gruhunchously> Save a few people or irradiate the main food source for miles around?
[1:23:53] <+FernanDoough> fallout out 45 is cool
[1:23:55] <indig0bird> You should save the Vault residents
[1:23:55] <zafooru> E V I L
[1:24:00] <TranquilTurnip> How old is that message?
[1:24:01] <Khorneflakes_> But people
[1:24:02] <Mr_Strut> YEAH

[1:24:03] <%PaladinDupre> OPEN DOOR
[1:24:05] <+ogrest> how is the farm more important tho
[1:24:05] <Psychicspacecow> I swear 10% of the quests for this game involve this place at some point
[1:24:12] <ScreamingMeat> They did it to themselves
[1:24:12] <%LogothX> farm = food
[1:24:13] <zafooru> if they wanted to not die they should come out and stop you
[1:24:14] <ahbhajit> I too saved the farm, but only because I didn't know the family at all
[1:24:15] <%sparrrow_> a stupid farm is more important than human life?
[1:24:19] <+ogrest> they can move the farm, if you turn that thing off people will die
[1:24:19] <alexandrecau> How many vault experiment wouldn'T be failure if people weren'T assholes
[1:24:19] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat not really important, that's what it is.
[1:24:23] <+burgahb> vineJape
[1:24:23] <Gruhunchously> But fun fact: If you do save these people, you can meet them in the Aerotech Park Refugee Camp.
[1:24:24] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat but family and children!
[1:24:27] <%ThatGuyfromMars> wtf
[1:24:30] <evbites> farm
[1:24:31] <+SmoochSpider> Pat please put on the spacesuit so you don’t get even more irradiated @angriestpat

[1:24:35] <%PaladinDupre> OPEN DOOR
[1:24:35] <studleydoorite> human life IS a stupid farm
[1:24:40] <Psychicspacecow> they show up at aerotech if you don't kill 'em
[1:24:40] <TranquilTurnip> Is there really even a family down there?

[1:26:31] <%kiiiirsten> We.....................DID it.......
[1:26:32] <The_Bob_Guy> what's more important chat? a family? or all the families that will starve if the farm is destroyed? 🤔
[1:26:32] <indig0bird> @dekkitout lol
[1:26:33] <%sparrrow_> Pat killed Harambe
[1:26:34] <$Tuskor13> I just got here a few minutes ago what was the quest

[1:26:35] <nina9669> TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun
[1:26:35] <CuttleCrow> you CAN JUST RELOCATE FARMS PAT
[1:26:36] <grimnier> Pat did nothing wrong
[1:26:36] <+shadowace2400> So I just installed A Tale of Two Wastelands, so that's neat
[1:26:38] <FRICK_hydra> glad you're enjoying my third favorite game of all time
[1:26:39] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat you literally did THE OPPOSITE
[1:26:40] <%TheSpiritof2277> You would've met them later actually, you're actually a big murderer apatDab
[1:26:41] <+Skatedeandre> Wait there were people in there?
[1:26:42] <%Romulus1213> Pat the Villain
[1:26:42] <RollCritFail> That's debatable, but sure
[1:26:43] <Profbathrobe> krunkO
[1:26:44] <+StromkoPenguin> @codussalpha They would've been trapped anyway, they were going to turn into incest cannibal ghouls.
[1:26:44] <+ogrest> @LogothX NCR is californian, trust me, they'll be making the farmers be gay by law and taxing them into the dirt in no time thus defeating the entire purpose
[1:26:44] <%Disname23> Their fault for not leaving the vault sooner apatDab
[1:26:44] <ZNC1990> but even tho you see them, you still fucked the farms.
[1:26:47] <%PaladinDupre> its fiiiiiiine
[1:26:50] <AggsMK7> Meh, 20 years tops
[1:26:57] <$Brother_Coduss> @StromkoPenguin they literally dont

[1:28:08] <JittersCaffeine> You have Veronica Equipped with the firndly fire gauntlets

[1:29:32] <callsigneagle01> So I know people have their own answers to this, but what makes New Vegas so much better than 3 and 4?
[1:29:32] <%OwlLightningMage> No one correct Pat LUL
[1:29:33] <%TheSpiritof2277> drowned when you have a device which recirculates air

[1:29:43] <ZNC1990> i think pat IS wear8ng the spacesuit guys
[1:29:44] <OlmStranger> I got so mad navigating this place
[1:29:47] <%Laecerelius> Drowned in the sarcophagus juice
[1:29:47] <CuttleCrow> try using the local map Kappa
[1:29:49] <%Bt_Robot> Bethesda have that kind of problem with their games. You can be max level before starting the main quest.
[1:29:52] <%VRNK> i remember having this EXACT problem in this location
[1:29:53] <Gruhunchously> @callsigneagle01 The cohesiveness of the world and the attention to detail.
[1:29:54] <%PipIV> mermaider
[1:29:59] <%thedemoninthestorm> Pat use the Gosh Darn local map
[1:30:00] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat HONK the glowing one corpse had a KEY ON IT
[1:30:01] <ScreamingMeat> Read the door signs Pat
[1:30:05] <%Romulus1213> Pat is wearing combat armor
[1:30:08] <%TheSpiritof2277> This vault's layout is a mess
[1:30:09] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat leave veronica outside the room
[1:30:12] <JittersCaffeine> Check your local map
[1:30:12] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> 1
[1:30:16] <%Dioliciouss> yassss i get to catch him live
[1:30:17] <Gruhunchously> @callsigneagle01 Oh, and the roleplaying options too.
[1:30:19] <ahbhajit> love this game. the vaults are... not great, level design wise
[1:30:22] <CuttleCrow> local map is probably more confusing though
[1:30:23] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat she might blow the all american through the ground
[1:30:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> @callsigneagle01 It was made by Obsidian. They're much better at making good RPG experiences than Bethesda could ever hope to
[1:30:25] <dekkitout> simply put what makes someone like fallout 3 and 4 is better in new vegas
[1:30:26] <%ShaneWhite> What’s up @angriestpat what I missed
[1:30:30] <%TheDude8D> use the anti mat
[1:30:31] <+StromkoPenguin> Still rockin' the varmint rifle at level 22. Brass balls this guy.
[1:30:33] <%VRNK> zero reaction to rifle bullet in head

[1:30:35] <thelonechris> He didn't even care at first
[1:30:41] <%LogothX> B - BANG
[1:30:41] <Norggron> ah yeah, this place got the best gun
[1:30:43] <dekkitout> well- unless you liked 4 for the crafting and settlements
[1:30:44] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @callsigneagle01 there's more charm to it, it takes itself seriously enough, but not so serious that makes it a wet blanket, the glitches make it kinda endeavoring. Plus it had some of the OG Black Isle crew working on it.
[1:30:45] <%Romulus1213> Did pat upgrade ED-E?
[1:30:57] <alrobot2014> yep
[1:30:57] <JittersCaffeine> Are ALL your weapons low rate of fire with low ammo capacity?
[1:31:05] <deity_majora> @AngriestPat Why haven't you gotten the rebreather yet? You get it from doing the Boomer quests.
[1:31:13] <mayorrev> ewwww bio slime!
[1:31:14] <Parapattern> Pat is at home in the slime
[1:31:14] <FracturedImage> Yea Pat upgraded EDE with the Followers
[1:31:19] <Gruhunchously> @callsigneagle01 And the companions are pretty great.
[1:31:24] <callsigneagle01> Yeah but it feels like it just feels better. Like New Vegas feels like a Western in a traditional sense with a post-apocalypse theme overlay
[1:31:27] <xFREDERICKx> are you playing this with mods
[1:31:32] <CuttleCrow> After you upgrade ED-E your other follower can be anyonr

[1:34:03] <%PipIV> 'MERICA
[1:34:03] <%ribboons> the best shotgun

[1:35:01] <%cureneckbeard> lucky ted
[1:35:03] <%TheSpiritof2277> @Nymphonomicon It's where the Boomers stockpile their redbull
[1:35:05] <callsigneagle01> Also on a more recent note what does Fallout's future even look like now that 76 died so hard?
[1:35:05] <dekkitout> archer would be proud, theres a gun every five paces in here
[1:35:08] <Inebriateddonut> Also missile launcher

[1:35:41] <Geno4344> make her wear the dress in the irradiated vault
[1:35:42] <+StromkoPenguin> Give her the rocket launcher , have her use it from now on. It'll be funny, at first.
[1:35:50] <+AlopekisPup> Get. Her. A. Dress.
[1:35:50] <%cameronfincher> you know Pat could just go to the Legion safehouse and console command it to unlock and get the Lucky Shades
[1:35:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> She'd look good in one of those pre war dresses they use to Swing dance
[1:35:55] <Inebriateddonut> Only wear dress. Wear dress on head only
[1:35:56] <a_mad_dragon> give her a fat man

[1:36:23] <mayorrev> ayy
[1:36:25] <thelonechris> Hard choice
[1:36:27] <%cureneckbeard> don't give her a dress, what if she wears it instead of armor
[1:36:28] <+AlopekisPup> Is the experimental MIRV in this game?
[1:36:36] <+God_damnit_why> Beast punch girl
[1:36:40] <krewl123> gasp
[1:36:41] <+StromkoPenguin> @callsigneagle01 Fallout might be dead but Obsidian's making a new FPS RPG

[1:37:16] <+Nymphonomicon> @callsigneagle01 Maybe we'll get lucky and Obsidian will make bank and buy their baby back from Bethesda.

[1:37:26] <ahbhajit> Riot Shotgun EATS ammo but it shoot so good
[1:37:27] <mayorrev> ooomph thats dope
[1:37:28] <+StromkoPenguin> @alopekispup Outer Worlds. No way to know if it'll be great or what but it's a bit of a spiritual successor to this.
[1:37:28] <Lulu19> chat is retarded
[1:37:29] <%thedemoninthestorm> It's not full-auto but it does shoot fast
[1:37:34] <+Grayhammatter> pull my gun trigger
[1:37:36] <zeroraider> You need to FIX that shotgun!!
[1:37:39] <Norggron> isnt there a mod that makes it full auto?
[1:37:41] <Ultimatefool> But do you have the shortest range of them all?
[1:37:41] <+AlopekisPup> @StromkoPenguin That's awesome. :D
[1:37:43] <callsigneagle01> @Nymphonomicon maybe both will just die and someone will make a new post-apocalypse game
[1:37:43] <%sparrrow_> Pat you missed a key underwater
[1:37:44] <Decimated_body> Get all shotgun perks pls
[1:37:45] <ScreamingMeat> But what about inverted range?

[1:37:47] <%koreanbae> Pull my All American Trigger
[1:37:48] <+Fenlig> I dont like how the weapons in this game just look normal
[1:37:48] <dekkitout> there's a mod for that
[1:37:49] <$SleepyMaribo> how you planning on repairing it?
[1:37:50] <+SparkAfterDark> This Machine might kill communists but THAT machine kills everything in the god damn building
[1:37:50] <krewl123> @Lulu19 and?
[1:37:51] <%TheDude8D> riot for riot
[1:37:51] <+Ciphris> isn't that gun auto

[1:38:11] <ScreamingMeat> LET START a RIOT!
[1:38:12] <mayorrev> peepee cry
[1:38:16] <Conky89> The only fear with Outer World's is how buggy it will be. This is Obsidian afterall (although in fairness publishers have forced them to release games on a time crunch).
[1:38:16] <alrobot2014> @crimsonharvest yes
[1:38:18] <+Nymphonomicon> @callsigneagle01 Obsidian aren't lazy fuckups like Bethesda.
[1:38:20] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I'm not so into Outer Worlds because Chris Avellone isn't contributing to it and I'm not even sure if J.E. Sawyer is wroking on it either
[1:38:22] <2midgetsinacoat> Survivalist Rifle is way better than All American
[1:38:24] <+SmoochSpider> Maaaaoooooow
[1:38:26] <%kujofire990> You got your silencer, your lounderner, your auto cocker...and this....this is for shooting down police helicopters
[1:38:28] <%PaladinDupre> DRAGONS BREATH
[1:38:32] <callsigneagle01> No just a different kinda fuckup
[1:38:33] <jobbedbone> where is emlo
[1:38:34] <ahbhajit> @crimsonharvest Dinner Bell is great for long range, plus those slug rounds are legit
[1:38:40] <dekkitout> who is publishing outer worlds, time to fire up the google machine
[1:38:46] <%PipIV> @kujofire990 oh I wont be needing that..... YET
[1:38:46] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Conky89 well hopefully now that MS owns Obsidian that should be managed
[1:38:47] <Norggron> survivalist cant be silenced though
[1:38:48] <ScreamingMeat> Survivalist Rifle is best girl
[1:38:49] <Gruhunchously> @ThatGuyfromMars Yeah, the lack of Chris Avelonne is kind of a bummer.
[1:38:50] <callsigneagle01> tbh I don't know if they'd be able to pull off another New Vegas
[1:38:53] <MoulesFritz> did pat do donation reads yet
[1:38:54] <Decimated_body> When are you gonna do dlc???????
[1:39:01] <Izuurus> survivalist rifle is so freaking cool
[1:39:05] <alrobot2014> the survivalist rifle is the best gun with the best story
[1:39:05] <%thedemoninthestorm> Survivalist rifle also has awesome lore
[1:39:07] <%kujofire990> @PipIV if I had my gun I'd shoot you
[1:39:20] <FracturedImage> what about the Medicine Stick?
[1:39:22] <%TheDude8D> oof
[1:39:22] <%OwlLightningMage> My low expectation for Outer Worlds is that it will be better than that piece of shit Fallout 4 and joke 76 LUL
[1:39:23] <Inebriateddonut> Isn't This Machine one of the best ones?
[1:39:23] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[1:39:25] <ahbhajit> Survivalist Rifle is from Honest Hearts, right?
[1:39:29] <alrobot2014> yep
[1:39:30] <misterspotswood> thanks to new vegas im considering blowing $300 on wood furniture for my AR, fuck
[1:39:31] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat riot shotgun is a VERY good shotgun
[1:39:32] <Sleepsie_> KomodoHype
[1:39:35] <%PipIV> @kujofire990 yeah, well, you don't. have fun waiting five days!
[1:39:36] <olwe123> Where is Paige at?
[1:39:37] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Gruhunchously Chris Avellone was probably one of the best writers at Obsidian, Sawyer made a really good game with New Vegas, but Avellone gave it heart. But I have bias since I'm a huge fanboy of Avellone's stuff
[1:39:38] <Decimated_body> and that's on the shotguns weakest power
[1:39:41] <jobbedbone> BibleThup
[1:39:43] <MoulesFritz> you missed mine at the start so i'm waiting for you to get to them again
[1:39:44] <JittersCaffeine> Check out that accuracy
[1:39:45] <jobbedbone> BibleThump
[1:39:47] <MoulesFritz> oof
[1:39:49] <mayorrev> he was running!
[1:39:50] <+AlopekisPup> @OwlLightningMage Hey. Don't hate on 76. It's going through a lot right now what with all the constant fuck ups.
[1:39:51] <%TheDude8D> boo riot
[1:39:56] <%dozind16> hey pat, have you seen the 300 iq expiriments you can do in RE2 demo?
[1:39:59] <Izuurus> it's versatile
[1:40:07] <%chungyboy> put him in a crumple state
[1:40:09] <jobbedbone> yeah he retweeted it
[1:40:13] <%Slaardacity> Survivalist was my main gun for the majority of the game after honest hearts
[1:40:14] <DrDomVonDoom> That stamd yyour ground law still in affect in the apocolypse good to know
[1:40:19] <%Disname23> @ThatGuyfromMars Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky are working on Outer Worlds, it's in extremely good hands even if Avellone is out
[1:40:20] <%OwlLightningMage> @AlopekisPup 76 needs to go into a trash can LUL
[1:40:23] <ScreamingMeat> @dozind16 It's on his twitter
[1:40:28] <2midgetsinacoat> Fallout 76 is basically more of a news story than it is a game
[1:40:31] <%kujofire990> @PipIV *grumbles for five days*
[1:40:39] <Gruhunchously> @ThatGuyfromMars I remember an interveriew where J.E Sawyer mentioned that Chris was really good at troubleshooting inconsistencies in the lore. Stuff the rest of the team had overlooked.
[1:40:42] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat do you have plans to play skyrim?
[1:40:47] <Izuurus> If the survivalist's rifle were a person, I would marry it.
[1:40:50] <DracaenaLeaf> You're back
[1:40:51] <%Niney_Who> Fallout 76 legitimately spawned a Black Market with its bugs
[1:40:53] <+AlopekisPup> @OwlLightningMage I'd agree if it was earlier on. At this point I'm just so impressed by how they're able to keep fucking up that I just want to see how far it goes.
[1:40:53] <%Niney_Who> and tha'ts amazing
[1:41:00] <dekkitout> fo76's fuck ups are too rife to not be intended
[1:41:09] <%PROUD2beGINGER> "you'll do"
[1:41:10] <JittersCaffeine> Why keep the magazines? You don' tuse them
[1:41:16] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat have you sold the energy weapon ammo
[1:41:17] <%Niney_Who> you can BUY HACKED GUNS for FO76 on Ebay
[1:41:18] <callsigneagle01> 'Fallout is dead go home'
[1:41:22] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Gruhunchously he wrote the Fallout bible so that's probably why, he also created a roleplaying game for the dev team while they were working on the OG Fallout 3
[1:41:29] <+JayEarly> @izuurus A Light Shining in Darkness for me
[1:41:30] <%PipIV> @jitterscaffeine but what if he needs them later tho?
[1:41:30] <callsigneagle01> 'Elder Scrolls will be dead soon too'
[1:41:30] <+InugamiTheHound> m1911 pistol is so damn good in this game
[1:41:31] <%OwlLightningMage> @AlopekisPup The fuck ups are so amazing. I'm excited to see what will happen next
[1:41:32] <ahbhajit> magazines are good for when you NEED to hit a check, you save them until then
[1:41:41] <%thedemoninthestorm> Punching out, best of luck Pat
[1:41:42] <CuttleCrow> doctor bag?
[1:41:42] <fragdar> i don´t have money for pat to notice me.. sad
[1:41:47] <Inebriateddonut> I don't know how to feel about Bethesda doing the "big whoopsies" I love bethesda but this is just too good
[1:41:59] <+InugamiTheHound> A Light Shining in Darkness and That gun are my favorite guns in the game because WW2 american soldiers
[1:42:02] <alrobot2014> ED-E?
[1:42:04] <Parapattern> DEAD
[1:42:04] <+AlopekisPup> @OwlLightningMage Seriously. I'm at the point where every day I'm just waiting to see what Bethesda managed to do this time.
[1:42:07] <alrobot2014> WHERE THE FUCK
[1:42:08] <%sparrrow_> EDE is dead
[1:42:08] <CuttleCrow> BLIND
[1:42:08] <dekkitout> cant wait to see if anything in the foreseeable future can out do fo76
[1:42:09] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I have a couple of those roleplaying cards signed by Avellone, I won a fallout haiku contest YEARS ago, under the assumption that the RPG he wrote for Fallout 3 was the prize
[1:42:10] <%CJett92> DED-E
[1:42:11] <%Kahiir> ED-E dead-E
[1:42:11] <FracturedImage> BLIND

[1:42:33] <ScreamingMeat> Fallout 76 is a bigger shit show than No Man's Sky ever was
[1:42:35] <CuttleCrow> Veronica needs a power helmet
[1:42:39] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat do you have plans to play skyrim?
[1:42:41] <callsigneagle01> he's a robot, he can't die cause he's not alive

[1:42:46] <pswayde> Give her a combat dress

[1:42:49] <%VRNK> visor of shame
[1:42:50] <callsigneagle01> this aint blade runner
[1:42:51] <+AlopekisPup> I've honestly never seen a game so consistently fuck up more than Fallout 76. It's like someone cursed it or something.
[1:42:51] <sodium_station> definitely need to find her a power armor helmet
[1:42:52] <%sparrrow_> why not give her a power helmet?
[1:42:54] <donkymagooterson> that helmet looks like the SCP guards'
[1:42:58] <Fujiwara_92> GIVE HER A DRESS
[1:43:04] <Parapattern> She looks like she has a tinfoil tv-dinner plate stuck to her face
[1:43:06] <%PipIV> just change out ED-E's batteries
[1:43:09] <Gruhunchously> I want to see her wearing a dress and that helmet.
[1:43:11] <dekkitout> here's to end of 2019's; this decade in gaming's biggest screw ups

[1:43:16] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat needs to find a fancy dress
[1:43:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> NMS was at least competently made

[1:43:33] <CuttleCrow> ?
[1:43:33] <+StromkoPenguin> The outcry against NMS was way worse than FO76, probably because way way less people got fooled by FO76.
[1:43:35] <%Niney_Who> 10mm SMG

[1:44:02] <Showizred> Riot shotgun repairs with assualt rifles
[1:44:02] <CuttleCrow> Pat it counts as a "rifle"
[1:44:05] <%ThatGuyfromMars> use assault rifles
[1:44:05] <+StromkoPenguin> People thought NMS was going to be amazing when it came out, but most of us knew Fallout 76 was going to be a piece of shit.
[1:44:05] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat riot shotgun is the same kind of gun as the all american

[1:44:21] <ahbhajit> 76 fucked up worse than NMS just based on the franchise level alone. new IPs fail and it's not a big deal cuz you can't compare it to anything. 76's fuck ups are noticeable cuz of the pedigree

[1:49:11] <%PenmanLupine> Oh, did Pat get the NCR Armor yet?
[1:49:13] <donkymagooterson> PatSlayer has a 1000% damage boost if the enemy is <5ft tall
[1:49:14] <%Laecerelius> you can probably get some by murdering another legion assassin squad
[1:49:18] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I see "Take a second" is the new "Excuse me"
[1:49:20] <Gruhunchously> Gay you way to victory.
[1:49:22] <%PenmanLupine> I know he got the key for the NCR Safehouse
[1:49:23] <Coystick> The most fun I had in Fallout 4 was getting a Legendary Combat Shotgun and renaming it the Massachusetts Mule
[1:49:23] <JittersCaffeine> What mods are you looking for?
[1:49:28] <dekkitout> gay to play
[1:49:31] <%cameronfincher> the dead ncr ghouls have medium armor
[1:49:33] <FourLeafLover> Legion Vexillarius is the hit squads wear medium armor
[1:49:35] <JittersCaffeine> I don't think any of your guns have mods

[1:50:10] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat only with Weapon Mods Expanded
[1:50:10] <%Mikatonic> when did pat like mods?
[1:50:11] <zeroraider> dont think so
[1:50:11] <SubjectX07x> It can't.
[1:50:12] <%someguy1472> I design and mod a Patslayer rifle now.
[1:50:12] <JittersCaffeine> that button is always there
[1:50:15] <%Niney_Who> You can't mod Unique Weapons without a mod
[1:50:15] <Peculiar_Pangolin> no unique weapon can
[1:50:16] <dekkitout> not without a mod for the mod
[1:50:17] <%OwlLightningMage> The most fun I had in Fallout 4 was using the explosive combat shotgun. That thing is the most busted gun to ever exist in one of these games. Too bad it was in one of the worst games LUL
[1:50:18] <$nademonkey1100> no
[1:50:18] <Parapattern> How can you mod America, Pat?
[1:50:18] <%Jon64s> No
[1:50:18] <ahbhajit> I always wanted a legendary double barrel that you don't reload in f4, but RNGsus is cruel
[1:50:19] <rekinom> America is free of your silly mods
[1:50:19] <%PenmanLupine> Unique Weapons can't be modded
[1:50:19] <alrobot2014> NO
[1:50:22] <JoeNeutrino> I'll tell you how patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
[1:50:24] <Coystick> 1
[1:50:24] <Gruhunchously> To the window, to the wall!
[1:50:25] <JittersCaffeine> The riot shotgun doesn't have any mods wither
[1:50:27] <AdHmazing> She had an Anti material Mod
[1:50:30] <+AlopekisPup> Get the mod mod, Pat!
[1:50:35] <alrobot2014> unless there's and extended barrel mod
[1:50:42] <%Niney_Who> Riot Shotgun also has no mods
[1:50:48] <Showizred> someone make a Patslayer gun but make it only useable by EDE
[1:50:51] <JittersCaffeine> DO you have all the Anti-material rifle mods?
[1:50:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Parapattern It's called the Constitutional Amendment Process. It takes a lot of work, though.
[1:50:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> @someguy1472 It must shoot mystery syringes, that are filled with liquid retail!
[1:50:58] <ScreamingMeat> No mods for Riot Shotty

[1:51:07] <$nademonkey1100> dragons breath
[1:51:09] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat You also need a mod from Nexus to get Riot Shotgun mods
[1:51:11] <dekkitout> anything with the explosive, bleeding, or irradiated modifier would fubar anything that looked at you funny
[1:51:13] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Riot shotgun doesn't need mods, its already OP with the right perks
[1:51:14] <Decimated_body> BIG BLIND
[1:51:16] <Gruhunchously> Oh man
[1:51:16] <%someguy1472> It broke the screen

[1:52:25] <%PaladinDupre> MAJAMAS

[2:57:33] <thelonechris> Your robots are better than our robots. Time to die.

[3:19:59] <IminyourBase> those shitty missiles didn't even blow up that wall
[3:19:59] <%ElenaManetta> All that was going through Pat's head during that were the sounds of whale songs
[3:19:59] <%TombstoneTTromboners> now to kill mr. house
[3:20:01] <lotharrio> @SGrim No, Pat's still gotta upgrade the REST of the Securitrons.
[3:20:02] <Gruhunchously> I've been in some basements.
[3:20:05] <%TheSpiritof2277> Ew
[3:20:10] <dekkitout> PogChamp pre install
[3:20:11] <+StromkoPenguin> It is not difficult to eliminate house no matter how strong his guards are.
[3:20:20] <ScreamingMeat> Seems kinda dumb to not have the Mark II built in by default.
[3:20:24] <+Bob_Tom> @AngriestPat are you playing for house or yes man?
[3:20:28] <BlitzChocula> so is House like, evil-er now?

[3:21:53] <dekkitout> i know big words too, shiteating profligate SeriousSloth
[3:22:13] <%ElenaManetta> All this advanced tech and all he can afford is a single glitchy image on a giant monitor.
[3:22:23] <brows_> He sounds a bit like Plague.
[3:22:29] <%CubicPhantom> "resurrected" that's a pull
[3:22:34] <%pectusumbra> That is LITERALLY the name of the skill that the Hellion has in Darkest Dungeon. Barbaric YAWP
[3:22:38] <%OwlLightningMage> He sounds nothing like Plague at all LUL
[3:22:46] <%ElenaManetta> Pat is falling asleep at this villain's plan
[3:22:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Its the way his voice lingers
[3:22:59] <Parapattern> Mr. House except he communicates exclusively through a Twitch chat
[3:23:02] <Pookiedaexzile> it has a plague after taste
[3:23:05] <T_Sasquatch> why do i feel like this guy would say "would you kindly" a lot
[3:23:08] <%Mornaka> mustard
[3:23:11] <%ElenaManetta> Okay now shoot House's limbs and head off QUICK WHILE HE'S BUSY TALKING
[3:23:12] <%Remery_> A hint of plague
[3:23:12] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> MUSTARD? where
[3:23:15] <%lewdskeletor13> SNAAAKE EATER
[3:23:17] <Coystick> Mr. Gripes just the Securitrons all have swat cats faces
[3:23:18] <%OwlLightningMage> This guy knows where the lamb sauce is
[3:23:20] <+Grayhammatter> mustard
[3:23:31] <krymzen5> so he's monologuing bout nothing?
[3:23:40] <invisi_bliss> what's andrew ryan doing in fallout?
[3:23:42] <dekkitout> from what little i know of the mr plague, 'yawp' sounds like something he'd say
[3:23:42] <%ElenaManetta> oH LOOK HE'S NOT PART OF THE LEGION DID YOU HEAR HOW HE SAID IT
[3:23:59] <TranquilTurnip> We got ourselves a standoff
[3:24:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> He said it the non-pretentious way!
[3:24:10] <Fujiwara_92> man, Mr Stark is cool PogChamp
[3:24:23] <%TheSpiritof2277> WHO'S MONOLOGUING
[3:24:24] <+EvilSoully> NCR has their dickishness, but they're the best faction by far
[3:24:26] <TranquilTurnip> Basically Howard Stark
[3:24:32] <Coystick> Andrew Ryan and House are amalgams of the same people I think
[3:24:34] <WerewolfB> smart man
[3:24:34] <%ElenaManetta> Man the more I look at those lips... The more I get lost in them.
[3:24:35] <%Kahnicus> Is not a demi-mortal genius entrepreneur entitled to the sweat of his post-primitive tribals' brows? NO, says the Courier from the Wasteland.
[3:24:39] <Pookiedaexzile> you caught me monologuing
[3:24:51] <babo____> wow he actually does kinda look like howard stark. never noticed that
[3:24:52] <+Katyusha94> Boys, we're going to war with a brain in a jar
[3:24:55] <%OwlLightningMage> He's entitled to a bullet in his dick
[3:24:58] <lotharrio> @EvilSoully The only problem with the NCR in this game, is that they are over reaching themselves. Well, that and the imperialism implied in the first two games.
[3:25:02] <%YabbaTroll> LUL
[3:25:04] <dukenux> Howard Hughes is the basis for Mr House, Ryan and Stark
[3:25:05] <%Spydurman> LUL
[3:25:05] <thelonechris> The most important question
[3:25:08] <PSI_Guy95> is he a snowglobe????
[3:25:10] <SaintVice> Degenerates like you belong on a cross
[3:25:11] <%Remery_> Hobby :)
[3:25:12] <mayorrev> nerrrrrrrrd
[3:25:12] <%PROUD2beGINGER> no bulli
[3:25:13] <Estuko> He drink them
[3:25:14] <TranquilTurnip> is that because hes also trapped in a little dome?
[3:25:16] <Izuurus> metaphor
[3:25:17] <dukenux> "dey purdy"
[3:25:17] <%ElenaManetta> And you look inside and the parents of many kidnapped children are inside of them
[3:25:18] <mayorrev> N E R D
[3:25:18] <ScreamingMeat> SHUT UP, I like Snowglobes!
[3:25:20] <%OwlLightningMage> He's more like beef jerky
[3:25:21] <+EvilSoully> I agree, but that's a pretty minor flaw compared to everyone else
[3:25:22] <%TheSpiritof2277> It's like he's a controlling shit or something
[3:25:22] <SpaghettiAnchorite> Aw, he has a hobby :)
[3:25:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Oh my god, he is fucking citizen Kane
[3:25:24] <%LethargicRush> mr house why you have all these gunpla?
[3:25:27] <BlitzChocula> lol, he just likes snowglobes. sheesh.
[3:25:27] <thesoldierofjoy> OH, whos the primate yawpin' NOW?
[3:25:28] <+Blankets_and_Tea> yeah you dumbass LUL
[3:25:28] <dukenux> "Rosebuuuuud..."
[3:25:28] <Coystick> Neeeeeeeeeeeeerd
[3:25:30] <+EvilSoully> Legion is... The Legion, and House is a cunt
[3:25:32] <%kiiiirsten> nice question dummy
[3:25:33] <%Afterman_> its cuz hes in a glass dome!
[3:25:34] <+Bad1uck> The damned dam
[3:25:35] <Gruhunchously> Why would you ask such a question?
[3:25:35] <evbites> you knew as soon as his brain rots the strip is fucked
[3:25:39] <+EvilSoully> And Wild Card fucks everything up for everyone
[3:25:39] <Pookiedaexzile> How many inches you got?
[3:25:42] <C_S_N_G> Don’t forget the DLC snowglobes
[3:25:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> wow, you can feel the eyeroll from House from that question
[3:25:42] <%OwlLightningMage> He's beef jerky in the freezer
[3:25:43] <%Kahnicus> Degenerates like you belong on a nuclear winter in the knee.
[3:25:46] <ravencloak13> Nah, besides us only House real cares about New Vegas. The NCR just want this area as a forward base of operations to push all the way
[3:25:48] <%SpamKingRathalos> House is a boss, put some respeck on his name.
[3:26:00] <%lizard0tm> FUCK YOU Las Vegas is awful
[3:26:02] <a_mad_dragon> las vegas is fucking disgusting
[3:26:05] <%lizard0tm> I live here
[3:26:07] <babo____> yea i always went against mr house. hes just too shady
[3:26:08] <aeonicvector> fun fact, given caps given per snowglobe VS caps given per platinum chip, he values collectibles about as much as the city
[3:26:08] <%lizard0tm> it SUCKS
[3:26:08] <%ElenaManetta> "What's with that picture of Steve Buscemi on your wall?" "WHAT OF IT? I LIKE IT. SOMETHING ABOUT HIS PRESENCE IS... SOOTHING."
[3:26:08] <%LethargicRush> it was a bunch of people standing outside hotels peddling cheap shirts and memorbilia
[3:26:11] <+jjjkopf> vegas is a shithole in the desert
[3:26:11] <TranquilTurnip> Implying Las Vegas is some utopia
[3:26:12] <lotharrio> NCR still has goddamn raiders in their territory.
[3:26:16] <sodium_station> This is FALLOUT's Las Vegas, not ours
[3:26:18] <%TombstoneTTromboners> I joined Mr. House my first run
[3:26:20] <%LethargicRush> thats vegas
[3:26:22] <Gruhunchously> Nostalgia is a hell of a drug.
[3:26:26] <ancrest_tant> Vegas is cool...for like 2 days
[3:26:27] <AdmiralButtloaf> sup fuckers how late am I
[3:26:29] <%ThatGuyfromMars> always join Mr. House
[3:26:30] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@AMMuffin) (warning)
[3:26:31] <carlmonte> Say what you want about House, but he was right about the nukes.
[3:26:32] <%hdawger> Of all the places to save... LET'S SAVE TITTI CITTI
[3:26:33] <Notalza> I
[3:26:33] <%sparrrow_> lmao yeah save Vegas instead of literally anywhere else dude Kappa
[3:26:34] <%Remery_> Our vegas smells like ass and fear :(
[3:26:35] <%kiiiirsten> \4\? ?
[3:26:36] <evbites> asshole
[3:26:36] <%kiiiirsten> +
[3:26:37] <FackinCrazy> HE could have told someone motherfucker
[3:26:38] <$SGrim> Obviously he never went to: Reno, Dubai, Singapore, basically half of South Korea, and many more... rooKek
[3:26:38] <ravencloak13> @tranquilturnip Well, in this time it pretty much is.
[3:26:39] <%Kahnicus> Apparently the Dead Money snowglobe is worth like 10k caps
[3:26:39] <+StromkoPenguin> The protagonist in these Fallout games always lives to be like 103 or something, he's as stable a choice as leader as anyone else. At least when there's a huge drought and everybody dies he can reload the game. barrThunk
[3:26:42] <BlitzChocula> "Vegas was merely the stage for the greatest battle of the old age - EVO some called it."
[3:26:42] <%OwlLightningMage> You could've saved the world if your really wanted to
[3:26:43] <Animal_Farm4> that's a LOT of nukes
[3:26:45] <Predatorhahaha23000> Hi Pat
[3:26:45] <%xijiy> Jesus
[3:26:47] <%xijiy> 77
[3:26:48] <%skizzuto> jeez that's a lot of nukes for just Vegas
[3:26:49] <+InugamiTheHound> I did independent ending as my first time with this game. The NCR and then *** and last one was legion
[3:26:52] <krymzen5> this is 60s future vegas tho, so it was super great
[3:26:52] <+miguelrod777> WHY 77
[3:26:52] <Peculiar_Pangolin> 77 for one city seems excessive
[3:26:53] <%SpamKingRathalos> see how fucking badass he is
[3:26:53] <+Grayhammatter> 77!? holy shit
[3:26:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Vegas is the shit, All the gangs talk funny, weed is legal, and prostitutes have meal plans
[3:26:59] <TranquilTurnip> @ravencloak13 I didn't take into account the fact that this is the fallout version I guess hah
[3:27:06] <%sparrrow_> star wars systems eh?
[3:27:07] <Parapattern> Why even waste nukes on Vegas?
[3:27:08] <ravencloak13> @sgrim Of course he hadn’t. They were at war with thrm in this world
[3:27:09] <+jjjkopf> that means like a thousand hit DC and that place was still largely intact
[3:27:13] <%hdawger> I just wanna double check, Pat hasn't done any of the DLC yet, right chat? I'm assuming he's waiting till endgame
[3:27:16] <+Katyusha94> Shouldve paid for Amazon Prime
[3:27:16] <%TombstoneTTromboners> well damn
[3:27:18] <krymzen5> 77 nukes. enough to kill anthing tht moves
[3:27:20] <TranquilTurnip> womp womp
[3:27:20] <Predatorhahaha23000> everyone had beef because they did not get their lucky number Kappa
[3:27:21] <a_mad_dragon> SUNNYDALE?
[3:27:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> Shit! He is fucking competent! Props to him!
[3:27:22] <%sparrrow_> no dlc yet
[3:27:24] <Gruhunchously> @Parapattern It's the end of the world, who gives a shit?
[3:27:25] <sodium_station> This explains why the Mojave is in a relatively good state
[3:27:28] <+Lolsoar> Sunnyvale drkKEK drkSword
[3:27:28] <%CubicPhantom> should have paid for the Amazon same day shipping
[3:27:32] <alrobot2014> 77 nukes because 76 wasn't enough
[3:27:32] <%TheSpiritof2277> Woops
[3:27:33] <%Remery_> damn courier pigeons :/
[3:27:36] <EASrake> All these bombing happened on my birthday :)
[3:27:36] <%Spydurman> Buffy the Chip Slayer?
[3:27:37] <%hdawger> @sparrrow_ Thx
[3:27:39] <lotharrio> I don't think all 77 were aimed at Vegas. He probably shot down a lot that were heading towards nearby states.
[3:27:40] <%ElenaManetta> Should've overnight'd it with Amazon.
[3:27:41] <$SGrim> @ravencloak13 House was alive and well traveled before the War started. Also, Reno is in California
[3:27:41] <dukenux> OOF
[3:27:43] <+VektorTroika> it was shipped from California - there's the problem
[3:27:43] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Damn it Buffy NotLikeThis
[3:27:44] <WerewolfB> damn
[3:27:44] <+InugamiTheHound> also you see tons of halloween stuff. I never kew that until i played fallout 4 LOL
[3:27:48] <Pookiedaexzile> B
[3:27:49] <DraxTD> I went afk for 5 min and we're still at Walt Disney??
[3:28:03] <Pookiedaexzile> bruh....they predicted the future
[3:28:04] <+Lolsoar> @SGrim Reno is in Nevada dude LuL
[3:28:10] <+Katyusha94> Loaded himself up Windows 95
[3:28:10] <thelonechris> Windows updates
[3:28:11] <lotharrio> Alternatively, there's some major industrial and financial institutions in this Las Vegas.
[3:28:12] <%SpamKingRathalos> House, is a G O D
[3:28:12] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> He pulled a Vin from Jak 2
[3:28:13] <%CubicPhantom> you found the Windows XP install disk. nice
[3:28:13] <+Katyusha94> Ran like a bueat
[3:28:18] <Estuko> PogChamp WINDOW 95
[3:28:22] <%OwlLightningMage> Bethesda make the first version of is software LUL

[3:28:28] <ancrest_tant> Sounds like a Pat stream
[3:28:32] <%Big_Dream> Kill him

[3:28:41] <Predatorhahaha23000> Et tu Brutus?
[3:28:41] <ravencloak13> @sgrim I know Reno but wouldn’t there still have been tension with Korea? And well, a persons own taste are always a thing.

[3:28:48] <%MrBorisMakarov> moon2M
[3:28:51] <Gruhunchously> So here's a fun fact: In Fallout 2, if you play as female character and name her Buffy, the game acknowledges it several times, and one woman gives you a ton of free stuff in the early game.
[3:28:51] <nina9669> MY EYES!
[3:28:52] <AlasterAngelo> THE BALD EVIL
[3:28:53] <%TheSpiritof2277> Says the bald tube man LUL

[3:28:58] <evbites> kill him
[3:29:00] <lemon_lore> is he your evil twin?
[3:29:01] <dukenux> Bald Evil
[3:29:04] <%sparrrow_> I bet the Platinum Chip has great action gameplay Kappa LUL
[3:29:04] <%ElenaManetta> Hold on, let me get my glasses to see an image on this CHIP.
[3:29:05] <+dickdickerson5> moon2COFFEE
[3:29:12] <%Remery_> Snowglobes!!!
[3:29:13] <DraxTD> I'm not tellin ... nehhhhhh
[3:29:15] <%cureneckbeard> History fact: the name Caesar means "hairy", a nickname for Julius Caesar because he was bald
[3:29:16] <%Kahnicus> But will death be your gift?
[3:29:21] <ccdrchau> House is the only right option, NCR has almost no tech and it's Scientists are repeatedly shown to have basically no clue how to get back to high tech whilst House is probably the last remaining person alive that knows how to innovate back to the future and get humanity back on track.
[3:29:22] <Predatorhahaha23000> give ceaser them 28 stab wounds pat bet you wont
[3:29:23] <+MooseyFate100> EXPOSURE
[3:29:23] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> If it's anything like Borderlands, there's nothing. It was all for nothing
[3:29:23] <+EvilSoully> Oh god
[3:29:26] <TranquilTurnip> I offer you, purpose!
[3:29:27] <%FrostMass22> Caesar is bald evil
[3:29:28] <+TheEvaFreak> Pyramid Scheme
[3:29:29] <+StromkoPenguin> @ravencloak13 In any feasible WW3 scenario, Korea is utterly irrelevant. China has way way more nukes.
[3:29:36] <TikanZK> okay i believe you
[3:29:37] <dekkitout> a seat in the new world order? yeah sure, i guess...
[3:29:37] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@EvilSoully) (warning)

[3:29:41] <Coystick> See OUTER WORLDS Prequel
[3:29:42] <Estuko> What does Mr House need the Children's Health Insurance Program for ??
[3:29:43] <%D_day> Actually picking House OMEGALUL
[3:29:43] <Admiral_PopnFresh> what a con pitch
[3:29:44] <%Spydurman> good quest name
[3:29:47] <$SGrim> @ravencloak13 in the lore of the Fallout Universe, South Korea would have basically been a vassal state of the US up until they split into the 13 commonwealths. House would have been able to travel there before this happened.
[3:29:50] <Gruhunchously> How does he know that?
[3:29:50] <lotharrio> North Korea is a problem for South Korea and Japan. That's about it.
[3:29:55] <PSI_Guy95> didn't even get to say "Caesar already invited me!"
[3:29:56] <%Remery_> Just hide it between your buttcheeks
[3:29:57] <%ThatGuyfromMars> aww Pat missed my favorite line
[3:29:58] <%sparrrow_> shove it up your ass to hide it pat
[3:29:59] <SpikeEffectSatanicSoldier> You gonna kill House?
[3:30:01] <%Deft_Thought> Fuck Mr. House
[3:30:02] <%ElenaManetta> wHAT WAS THAT COURIER? I HEARD THAT!!!
[3:30:06] <aeonicvector> Nah man, go murder haus
[3:30:07] <%OwlLightningMage> Aren't you gonna kill him?
[3:30:08] <%xijiy> Mr. House is my favorite faction
[3:30:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah son i got 1 more question....is one of these robots equipped to buss it open
[3:30:09] <BlitzChocula> is the chip sentient?! like the One Ring kind of dealio?
[3:30:11] <+EvilSoully> He's offering us a spot in a multi-levle marketing scheme! That bastard!
[3:30:12] <%Shonen_hero> House is such a sanctimonious jackass
[3:30:14] <Coystick> House is my boy you're all brats
[3:30:14] <%Jon64s> Kill house
[3:30:15] <Gruhunchously> Where to now?
[3:30:16] <ravencloak13> @stromkopenguin I know but like, Korea, specifically North would still be piss babies right?
[3:30:18] <faldin> it seems like the best fallout games are based on the west coast
[3:30:18] <+StromkoPenguin> House doesn't seem to understand how to upgrade the drivers on his robots and he had at least a hundred years to work at it. He isn't the techno messiah, he's just an old rich dude.
[3:30:19] <+Katyusha94> Step one: Insert Chip into the box
[3:30:20] <%Kahnicus> Did he go to the promontory?
[3:30:24] <+Katyusha94> Step 2:????
[3:30:24] <%sparrrow_> the idea of a New Vegas speedrun seems so stupid, what's the point?
[3:30:24] <a_mad_dragon> BURN THE HOUSE DOWN
[3:30:25] <%Kahnicus> Nah, brotherhood armor
[3:30:26] <alrobot2014> @BlitzChocula the chip is a bunch of driver updates
[3:30:28] <%ElenaManetta> You kill Benny but let that crippled skeletor live? What the fuck
[3:30:28] <Gruhunchously> @StromkoPenguin
[3:30:30] <%OwlLightningMage> You can't do House and the Brotherhood at the same time
[3:30:31] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat Why havent you talked to the followers chick outside the 38?
[3:30:32] <ravencloak13> @sgrim Oh, didn’t know that.
[3:30:34] <Rang0Steel> house is an ass but the lucky 38 is awesome
[3:30:34] <Tucker0603> house is a massive shitheel
[3:30:39] <%CubicPhantom> House's dream is stupid
[3:30:40] <Coystick> Take care of your house
[3:30:41] <Predatorhahaha23000> et tu patticus thou shalt slay ceaser or for naught you shant? (i have no idea what i said)
[3:30:43] <Gruhunchously> @StromkoPenguin He was in a coma for most of the hundred years.
[3:30:44] <+Lolsoar> @ravencloak13 NK is like an infant with a switchblade when it comes to nuclear power
[3:30:45] <BlitzChocula> @alrobot2014 ah, so more evil than the One Ring.
[3:30:47] <%TombstoneTTromboners> ok
[3:30:49] <TranquilTurnip> Oh boy Clap

[3:30:54] <WoRabbit> nice
[3:30:54] <%LethargicRush> ooooooh
[3:30:56] <Gruhunchously> OHH YEAH
[3:30:57] <$SGrim> @ravencloak13 I only know that because I am obsessive over this series.
[3:30:57] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @StromkoPenguin technology didn't advance like it did in our timeline, so he was probably unable to upgrade the drivers on his own
[3:30:58] <%pectusumbra> Oh BOY
[3:30:58] <ahbhajit> hell yeah
[3:30:58] <%ThePuddingDead> oh?
[3:31:00] <%Deft_Thought> SeemsGood Lookin forward to it
[3:31:02] <Estuko> @ElenaManetta another playthrough he might fuck benny, it's okay
[3:31:03] <bearalin> Oh nice
[3:31:03] <carlmonte> Unfortunately, House is also probably also mostly correct about most issues even if hes an ass
[3:31:03] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> "Just take a second"
[3:31:04] <%TombstoneTTromboners> "blow up the brotherhood of steel"
[3:31:05] <Skydude5> HELL YEAH
[3:31:05] <sodium_station> Is it House murder time?
[3:31:06] <%Shonen_hero> I'm excited yeyeyeyeye

[3:31:17] <%SpamKingRathalos> I hate this vault with a passion.
[3:31:22] <lotharrio> Spit in the tube! BrokeBack
[3:31:22] <%ThatGuyfromMars> there is a mod for that issue you have with House, pat.
[3:31:23] <%OwlLightningMage> House is also beef jerky in a fridge
[3:31:25] <EbuneezerSpluge> I missed it, whos the companion en?
[3:31:26] <turth3> I think i know which moment its gonna be
[3:31:30] <grimnier> killing the bos even though you found a good solution
[3:31:31] <ravencloak13> @lolsoar Your not wrong but given their leaders were also crazy enough to actually push the button.
[3:31:31] <zeroraider> All those years and he couldn't just figure out how to upgrade them without a chip...
[3:31:32] <%D_day> it's Kill the Brotherhood
[3:31:32] <%sparrrow_> House invented the Battle Royale genre, he needs to go
[3:31:32] <Gruhunchously> It's The Last of Us Vault.

[3:31:39] <%Remery_> @OwlLightningMage what flavor? :)
[3:31:41] <+The_monster_hunter> yeah 22 sucks ass
[3:31:43] <+d00msdaydan> the turning point is when house wants you to play smash for fisticuffs
[3:31:46] <%pectusumbra> ah, plant vault, I hope I get to see that
[3:31:46] <%SpamKingRathalos> Fungus in your asshole, vault edition.
[3:31:48] <pswayde> am I the only one who doesn't mind this vault?
[3:31:50] <krymzen5> who knew a super powerful weapons dealer could be evil?
[3:31:51] <%Kahnicus> did you go to the thorn? @AngriestPat
[3:31:52] <%TheSpiritof2277> Now I'm excited, hope Veronica punches him right in his cock-tube
[3:31:52] <shurtal> The Grass Type Pokemon Vault?
[3:31:54] <%ElenaManetta> hELLO SIR
[3:31:55] <%LocDogX86X> that vault is just awful
[3:31:55] <KoyaMusa> cause its like a 5 floor vault that's confusing to navigate, right?

[3:32:12] <Penakoto> Pat make sure you take Arcade with you when you talk to Ceasar
[3:32:14] <%Chatterbox1991> mrdestructoid100 Pat, what do you think of the notion of Outer Worlds being a "What If" scenario of House sending RobCo colonies into space as alluded to in New Vegas pending House victory over Hoover Dam. BTW Would it not be unreasonable to say that Haru is the Koromaru of P5? she has no flaws.
[3:32:17] <%sparrrow_> A Fiend is only an R away from being a friend :)
[3:32:21] <%Remery_> @OwlLightningMage Aww, tease :(
[3:32:22] <%ElenaManetta> lOOK IT'S A FRIEND oh it says fiend
[3:32:23] <%SpamKingRathalos> The spirit of Cook-Cook
[3:32:26] <Gruhunchously> @TheSpiritof2277 If you klll him and talk to Cass afterwards, she asks if you shot him in his cock tube.
[3:32:27] <%LethargicRush> Bam
[3:32:30] <lotharrio> I think Veronica's weapon triggered.
[3:32:33] <dukenux> House not only predicted when the war will start, but took precautions against it. hes an asshole but he might be the smartest man in mojave
[3:32:40] <FracturedImage> The Vicki and Vance gun is near hear in a shack
[3:32:41] <$SGrim> @TranquilTurnip don't be ridiculous, House would see too much of himself in Magneto or Professor X, and his narcissism would take over.
[3:32:44] <sodium_station> Yeah House is literally just Tony Stark's dad. A smart, rich asshole
[3:32:48] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Chatterbox1991 She has a big ass fivehead
[3:32:48] <%OwlLightningMage> I bet one of the corporations in Outer Worlds is just gonna be Mr. House
[3:32:50] <+StromkoPenguin> They were making a pilgrimage to Cook Cook's shrine to bless their upcoming rape feast.

[3:44:58] <%Kahnicus> @AngriestPat you going to vault 22? you should get bleed me dry first and get the mantis eggs while you're there
[3:44:59] <%king_wragles> Riot shotgun has the fastest reload, largest magazine, and probably the best rate of fire too
[3:45:00] <+austing1011> go there from the road
[3:45:00] <+SparkAfterDark> Depends on what kinda shotgun you like. This one shoots VERY FAST and that's probably the best thing for a shotgun to do. but there are other ones that have slightly better stats in other areas
[3:45:01] <$Mendin> Pat start doing the DLCs before you overlevel for themm
[3:45:01] <+Grayhammatter> got big Jebaited
[3:45:02] <%CollinsOfBodom> no mountain fucking 4 u

[3:45:29] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat that actually works out
[3:45:30] <a_mad_dragon> dinner bell's DPS is half of the riot shotgun
[3:45:31] <%TheSpiritof2277> Hell yeah, that vault is AWFUL
[3:45:31] <%TheDude8D> now the riot is ur best gun no joke
[3:45:31] <Gruhunchously> Ironcially, the first part of the Thorn quest sends you to Vault 22
[3:45:33] <+InugamiTheHound> alright pat and everyone in the chat I'm leaving because I'm gonna go stream warframe on mixer. Wish me luck and support me a fellow warframe streamer.
[3:45:33] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat you'll end up going back to v22 for dinner bell anyway

[3:46:21] <alwayspronking> FINISHED GAME
[3:46:21] <Predatorhahaha23000> it has transcended
[3:46:22] <PSI_Guy95> this burrowing tech is too strong
[3:46:22] <%Laecerelius> explosive rounds?
[3:46:23] <+mukbun> its ababy

[3:46:32] <%umbypokochan> yeah, let's just keep using this engine until we die
[3:46:32] <Gruhunchously> There's all stuck in the level geometry
[3:46:33] <%LethargicRush> even the babies
[3:46:34] <%OwlLightningMage> This is a good game engine you guys LUL
[3:46:34] <+lethallunacyx> welp
[3:46:35] <krewl123> fuck them wasps
[3:46:36] <%lizard0tm> use the tcl command to go into the ground and kill them
[3:46:37] <+SparkAfterDark> even the baby can just eat a round in the face
[3:46:38] <krewl123> and all waps that is
[3:46:42] <AdeptusAstronomicus> oh gawd not the children pat
[3:46:43] <%Kahnicus> those are some ugly god damn butterfrees
[3:46:46] <detritus25> Bye
[3:46:48] <%TheSpiritof2277> This engine is still going be salvaged for Skyrim 2
[3:46:49] <alwayspronking> Expect that wasp to attack you in like, 2 hours
[3:46:50] <Estuko> my leg flinched to escape LUL
[3:46:54] <%LocDogX86X> the thorn is better.... apatBig ol'fetch quest though
[3:46:57] <C_S_N_G> Why is ED-E’s laser back to the default, I thought it was upgraded?
[3:47:03] <$SGrim> @PlagueOfGripes how much for an uncomfortably sexy Cazador? rooGasm
[3:47:06] <%lizard0tm> @AngriestPat use the tcl command to go into the ground and kill them if you really want those kills
[3:47:07] <krewl123> @alwayspronking bring it
[3:47:08] <%derpumpkinking> Oh man I remember consistently falling through the ground in morrowind suing sunder and kneeing quests
[3:47:09] <%TheDude8D> Hey pat 4/0 ammo for the riot does more damage if i remember correctly
[3:47:11] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> didn't need all that ammo anyhow
[3:47:11] <%joylent_blue> yeah fuck limb selection on cazadors
[3:47:11] <+austing1011> you need to go to Vault 22 for the Thorn quest anyway pat
[3:47:12] <Gruhunchously> That's helpful if there are others around.
[3:47:14] <masterofthemash> @AngriestPat the wings so they cant fly
[3:47:18] <%derpumpkinking> sunder*
[3:47:18] <%DesperaDo2077> flawless
[3:47:26] <%Kahnicus> one is long range and one is medium
[3:47:27] <thelonechris> Veronica is getting stung to death
[3:47:28] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Gamebryo!
[3:47:30] <a_mad_dragon> the answer is bethesda
[3:47:30] <%TombstoneTTromboners> dual wielding lasers
[3:47:30] <sodium_station> switches based on range
[3:47:32] <alwayspronking> Maybe a close range and long range?
[3:47:32] <%derpumpkinking> was a desperate time if revolving saves.
[3:47:33] <zafooru> Ed E does what Ed E wants
[3:47:34] <alrobot2014> maybe he's style switching
[3:47:34] <lotharrio> Every single companion has a bug.
[3:47:34] <%PaladinDupre> @C_S_N_G @AngriestPat it has to do with range
[3:47:34] <%OwlLightningMage> i think it depends on range
[3:47:36] <+xxviios> wtf kinda bug takes 10 shotgun rounds
[3:47:38] <$Mendin> The answer is probably Lonesome Road existing makes Ed E do fucky t hings
[3:47:41] <PSI_Guy95> ...did E-DE get knocked out by poison
[3:47:41] <Latch77> @AngriestPat have you tried the solid project mod, it makes nv more like a modern shooter, you can even sprint PogChamp
[3:47:41] <%SpamKingRathalos> ED-E got pounded back there
[3:47:42] <AlasterAngelo> GUNSLINGER
[3:47:42] <dekkitout> special beam for special occasions
[3:47:44] <%homelesstwinky> melee laser
[3:47:44] <lotharrio> Except for gramma smash.
[3:47:45] <%joylent_blue> ED-E style switches
[3:47:46] <%Kahnicus> OG laser is long range, new one is mid range
[3:47:50] <+justarthur0> said earlier that ed-e's armor was crippled
[3:47:52] <%LocDogX86X> ED-E does what ED-E wants
[3:47:52] <alwayspronking> @xxviios Scary kinds
[3:47:52] <mr_slaide> Pat do you have hollow point bullets? And why not use them on Cazadores since they have 0 damage threshold.
[3:47:54] <%SpamKingRathalos> fuck, nooooo, not the vault, gods no
[3:47:55] <detritus25> I just got here and pat is already OP as f*ck
[3:47:55] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat the new laser doesn't change the look. The blue laser is Ed-E's short range electrical pulse.
[3:47:56] <+mukbun> hey look green vault
[3:48:01] <Gruhunchously> Nah, I remember him being fucky before Lonesome Road.
[3:48:02] <$Tuskor13> have we encountered the Garies yet

[3:56:39] <+Nymphonomicon> Just ghouls and rats, nothing major here.
[3:56:39] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageNirvana Easily. You can do it without a bodyguard if you plan for it.

[3:57:13] <lotharrio> "Blind" Luke.
[3:57:14] <%TheSpiritof2277> @arcaderabbit48 Fair enough, I know there ain't any real crucial quests here. I mean, frankly I stumbled on it 100%ing everything--just surprising given I think he's ran through it multiple times.
[3:57:14] <ahbhajit> @Kahnicus Nice! I only ever played 4-ish times, but 3 were wiki runs were I did everything so it was thorough lol
[3:57:15] <ebonifragaria> Pat the human toilet is intimidated by such a girthy sewer

[3:58:17] <%LethargicRush> got some hits in tho
[3:58:18] <arcaderabbit48> @TheSpiritof2277 Yeah, I played through this game a few times before discovering the sewers or The Pit itself. Hell, everything Pat is doing now is new content for me!
[3:58:19] <Ziulysses> @angriestpat it made a key sound when you picked it up
[3:58:20] <ZNC1990> roamer? more like reamer, marite?

[3:58:33] <detritus25> Why does pat even worry about anything
[3:58:34] <%Kahnicus> @ahbhajit well, besides legion quests, never actually done their side
[3:58:36] <%TheDude8D> uhhhh riot????
[3:58:38] <%OwlLightningMage> You forget you have a shotgun
[3:58:40] <zafooru> have you considered an automatic weapon
[3:58:40] <ebonifragaria> I love Data, he's the best
[3:58:42] <RutlerTheButler> luke's find is a key
[3:58:43] <metalliec> @kiiiirsten how far is angriest pat into the game? what part is he on?
[3:58:44] <FracturedImage> or a shotgun
[3:58:45] <+Grayhammatter> riot though
[3:58:46] <Gruhunchously> @detritus25 Because he's a coward.
[3:58:49] <AlasterAngelo> does Data have sex?
[3:58:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> Daydabase daydabase living in the daydabase. Superbeast superbeast, live from castle superbeast.
[3:58:51] <OToole42> riot shotgun nerd
[3:58:51] <TootPirate> Data is best boy
[3:58:51] <$nademonkey1100> you are suppose to fucking spam fire the all american
[3:58:54] <alrobot2014> did you forget what perk you just got
[3:58:56] <+mukbun> shot gun does big close range damage
[3:58:57] <%sparrrow_> north south sewers
[3:58:57] <detritus25> He has a companion that explodes folks
[3:58:59] <%dozind16> and you call yourself american? smh @AngriestPat
[3:59:00] <TranquilTurnip> I thought the map said "Eternal Sewer"
[3:59:01] <%CubicPhantom> ... the north sewers
[3:59:02] <%joylent_blue> metalliec he just killed benny, he hasn't done any DLC
[3:59:03] <$Tuskor13> Data FUCKS
[3:59:03] <%kiiiirsten> @metalliec He just killed Benny and gave House the chip, we've already talked to Yes Man and given him the secret handshake
[3:59:04] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat considering the All American is for mid-range rapid firing outside of VATS, it very likely does.
[3:59:04] <%lewdskeletor13> Brent Spiner voiced the Joker that one time
[3:59:06] <+StromkoPenguin> Automatic weapons aren't too terrible in FO:NV if I recall, they're just worthless in Fallout 4.
[3:59:07] <Gruhunchously> @AlasterAngelo He is fully functional, yes.
[3:59:09] <+Grayhammatter> PogChamp
[3:59:09] <+mukbun> ahh ground
[3:59:13] <%TombstoneTTromboners> sorry pat, you live here now
[3:59:13] <%Kahnicus> can you get to the thorn through the sewers? i think it's possible
[3:59:13] <%Shonen_hero> Data totally did the nasty with Yar
[3:59:16] <WerewolfB> floor pvpS
[3:59:18] <zeroraider> Pat's so full of wonder LUL
[3:59:19] <ebonifragaria> @AlasterAngelo He has over 50 pleasuring subroutines (I can't remember the exact quote)
[3:59:23] <alrobot2014> NOT FOR HONOR
[3:59:23] <ahbhajit> @Kahnicus best part about this game, there's always quests you haven't done lol. I never did legion all the way through, but i did run a bit through their quest line to betray em later l
[3:59:25] <%kiiiirsten> @metalliec He has apparently never seen these sewers before so we have entered A Whole New World just now
[3:59:25] <%TheSpiritof2277> @arcaderabbit48 Yeah, I know! It's pretty surprising how much new stuff is cram packed in this game. Always something you didn't know that you'll learn rerunning/watching someone do it. :p
[3:59:26] <%lewdskeletor13> NOT FOR HONOR
[3:59:26] <%PenmanLupine> Pat have you never been in the sewers?
[3:59:29] <%ThatGuyfromMars> yeah didn't data fuck bing crosby's granddaughter
[3:59:31] <metalliec> @kiiiirsten @joylent_blue beautiful. also you guys are great
[3:59:32] <%laserbeaming> BUT FOR YOUUU

[3:59:34] <Skydude5> Explorer Pat
[3:59:35] <%FrostMass22> Data was fully functional, but how big was his robodick?
[3:59:36] <TranquilTurnip> I love when you find more game after hundreds of hours of playthroughs
[3:59:36] <%Mornaka> SNAKE EATEEEERRR
[3:59:36] <detritus25> BIG SEWER DETOUR
[3:59:36] <%lewdskeletor13> BUT FOR YOU
[3:59:38] <alrobot2014> IN MY TIME
[3:59:39] <TootPirate> Data did a FUCK
[3:59:42] <$Tuskor13> in my heaaart
[3:59:43] <lotharrio> Automatic weapons are great in FO4, you just gotta get one of the legendary damage over time mods on them.
[3:59:45] <$SGrim> Pat might find the Draft NPC if he keeps exploring
[3:59:45] <%TheDude8D> riot for close, patr for med
[3:59:45] <Gruhunchously> And we ended up right where we began.
[3:59:46] <dukenux> talk to Red Lucy
[3:59:46] <+StromkoPenguin> Data's D was as big as you needed it to be.
[3:59:47] <%CubicPhantom> "there's like a whole world down there!"
[3:59:47] <%LethargicRush> what he went in a circle?
[3:59:55] <Gorgen> I have special eyes
[3:59:55] <%joylent_blue> thanks Obama
[3:59:56] <%dozind16> smoooooooooooooooooothhhh
[3:59:57] <+DesertOfSand> He has such big anime eyes
[3:59:59] <+ZweihanderSteve> I like how he just takes your word for it
[4:00:00] <%Kahnicus> @ahbhajit did enough to get the legion unarmed technique and then murder the shit out of caesar
[4:00:02] <Gruhunchously> Well, that's Pat disqualified.
[4:00:06] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@austing1011)

[4:00:17] <%dozind16> bye smooth skin
[4:00:19] <Redchimera45> Something is off here
[4:00:21] <+mukbun> eat the daugter
[4:00:22] <arcaderabbit48> @TheSpiritof2277 Its really impressive, especially given the history fo the game. I do wish we hade more of a reason to head down there, or to this part of Vegas, but what we do have mostly works really well. There's always something new to find
[4:00:22] <detritus25> His eyes are still in a dream
[4:00:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> Gotta clean up those filthy al-bheds.
[4:00:22] <+justinv95> Miss best friends play
[4:00:23] <metalliec> @AngriestPat did you tell the soldier at the memorial that his brother was a little bitch and so is he?
[4:00:24] <%ThatGuyfromMars> WHOAHOOOOOOOOOOOH
[4:00:24] <alrobot2014> CRlME! ITS THE WAY I FLY TOO YOUUUU
[4:00:25] <+StromkoPenguin> @lotharrio I guess so, it's just ridiculous that making a weapon automatic in FO4 completely nerfs it.
[4:00:26] <%LethargicRush> YEYE
[4:00:27] <%OwlLightningMage> Crack house time PogChamp
[4:00:28] <TranquilTurnip> Leave no stone unkilled

[4:00:32] <thesoldierofjoy> Kill the family, eat their pants
[4:00:34] <Gorgen> oh yeah the cannonballs
[4:00:35] <KRSG> How does he know about her friends?
[4:00:35] <%kiiiirsten> @metalliec He did indeed do that, yes
[4:00:36] <%nofestu2> Kill them all Pat.
[4:00:42] <$nademonkey1100> @AngriestPat you spam fire the all american

[4:00:52] <$Tuskor13> that's great
[4:00:54] <Redchimera45> moon2H
[4:00:55] <%ThatRandomGuy661> @AngriestPat Since that place was new to you, did you know about The Thorn?
[4:00:56] <TootPirate> @TranquilTurnip good shit
[4:00:57] <ebonifragaria> Chara approved.
[4:00:58] <%sparrrow_> no stoner unshot
[4:00:59] <metalliec> @kiiiirsten e x c e l l e n t
[4:00:59] <%OwlLightningMage> That's great LUL
[4:01:01] <%SpamKingRathalos> Rip & Tear
[4:01:02] <Gruhunchously> It's actually incredible what Obsidian was able to crank out in 18 months. Shame it only works half the time.
[4:01:02] <MissJenniecide> howdy!
[4:01:02] <%CubicPhantom> you've got quests on the ooother side
[4:01:02] <TranquilTurnip> SeemsGood
[4:01:04] <Trillex56> kill them for points pat
[4:01:05] <%laserbeaming> Kill all the Children
[4:01:06] <DSD24> Does Pat have That Machine?
[4:01:07] <+mukbun> shot gun
[4:01:11] <ahbhajit> @Kahnicus Same. I also removed a firing pin from their artillery and some other saboteur related stuff before me and Boone turned the Fort into Swiss Cheese
[4:01:12] <%lewdskeletor13> Kill ALL the sand people
[4:01:13] <%sparrrow_> the All American, made in china Kappa
[4:01:13] <$nademonkey1100> yeyeyeyeyeye
[4:01:15] <Shastafield> have you heard?
[4:01:17] <%kiiiirsten> @AngriestPat Have you never seen The Thorn in this game?
[4:01:17] <metalliec> fun fact, the all american is actually german made
[4:01:18] <Trillex56> adults are 100 points kids are 1000
[4:01:19] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @DSD24 yes EDE has it
[4:01:25] <Vlesh> You did get a shotgun perk and have a shotgun
[4:01:26] <arcaderabbit48> @StromkoPenguin I built up this massive minigun in FO4. Decked it out with all the strongest mods, the fire effect, the barbed wire for melee attacks. Had like 2000 bullets for it, and I chewed through most of it that in an afternoon. Rapid fire weapons are jsut awful in 4!
[4:01:28] <%Captainahab_37> Is this a place to say, fuck people who use energy weapons?
[4:01:30] <%TheSpiritof2277> @arcaderabbit48 The throttled dev-time especially being considered does in-fact make it more impressively, definitely. And yeah, there should be SOME more incentive than the arena side-quest. It was probably cutout the game if it existed, if I had to guess.
[4:01:32] <%TheDude8D> pat riot is best for vats, low AP use
[4:01:34] <detritus25> Kill them with your op guns
[4:01:36] <%Captainahab_37> because energy weapons arent cool at all
[4:01:38] <Rawsome83> all german
[4:01:40] <%Kahnicus> @ahbhajit yeah, that and activate the securitron army, good stuff
[4:01:45] <%LethargicRush> but
[4:01:46] <AlasterAngelo> energy weapons are baller
[4:01:46] <alrobot2014> this place is burned into my memory from New Vegas Bounties
[4:01:47] <%LethargicRush> kill them
[4:01:50] <%SpamKingRathalos> TIME TO INVADE
[4:01:50] <DSD24> @thatguyfrommars I love that gun so I am glad Pat has it thanks for telling me!
[4:01:52] <MissJenniecide> i'm so glad i caught a stream finally :D

[4:02:24] <alrobot2014> oh god it is jack
[4:02:25] <arcaderabbit48> @TheSpiritof2277 I believe there was going to be an option to fight the monsters you recover for them as like a paid pit fight sort of thing? But it was cut. Also a sidequest to release all the monsters to overrun and destroy the Pit form the inside out! Also cut.
[4:02:25] <Predatorhahaha23000> MOLF!

[4:02:32] <KRSG> @AngriestPat Did you know that there was a companion Brahmin called Betsy that was cut out of the game? She didn't fight, but could carry like 1000s pounds of stuff as she traveled with you? And that there are mods to bring her back.
[4:02:33] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> street scum. one street over from the Sharks

[4:02:41] <+StromkoPenguin> I ordered a laser to light my bong in the cleanest way possible, but it was from Hong Kong and turned out to be an ordinary laser pointer with no heat output at all.

[4:03:13] <%joylent_blue> lewdskeletor13 she plays jack in mass effect 2, don't remember her name
[4:03:15] <alrobot2014> @lewdskeletor13 don't know her by name but i believe she plays the role of Jack in mass effect 2
[4:03:18] <Gruhunchously> Oh yeah, she's also the female PC in Fallout 4
[4:03:18] <%Captainahab_37> is STALKER 2 dead?

[4:03:29] <%lewdskeletor13> TUNNEL SNAKES
[4:03:30] <%TheSpiritof2277> @arcaderabbit48 That's a damn shame. North Vegas had clearly some more potential, provided Obsidian had more contracted time than just, what, less than a year to work with lol.
[4:03:30] <%FrostMass22> Cerberus was right but then they retconned them to be wrong in 3
[4:03:33] <metalliec> @Captainahab_37 nope. we just got a teaser is all
[4:03:35] <%joylent_blue> Gruhunchously oh yeah thats also true
[4:03:36] <%laserbeaming> Black hat, he's evil

[4:03:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> This seems like the kind of late 20's guy who hangs out with 13 year olds
[4:03:40] <ahbhajit> @Kahnicus AHHH. I'm so excited!
[4:03:42] <%hdawger> Hey fellow *Checks notecard* Wasteland Wanderers

[4:04:06] <%Romulus1213> Touch his dick
[4:04:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I like 「GUN」 :)
[4:04:07] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Whoever was asking about jack, it was Courteney Taylor

[4:04:10] <%Remery_> Do I know myself?
[4:04:11] <dekkitout> oh my he IS coming n to you
[4:04:13] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat doesn't care about this guy. Who gives you recipes for ammo which Pat refuses to care about
[4:04:13] <%Kahnicus> @ahbhajit so it was both, you were right too
[4:04:14] <+Bad1uck> hawt
[4:04:14] <TranquilTurnip> Time to go ass to ass
[4:04:16] <PopulousNix> he's tryna tap that
[4:04:16] <thesoldierofjoy> wat
[4:04:17] <%LocDogX86X> nope pat doesn't
[4:04:19] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> I'm sure every race in Mass Effect has an organization dedicated to advancing the interests of their race
[4:04:20] <%sparrrow_> he's saying do you jerk off regularly Pat
[4:04:21] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat he gives you the ability to craft special .44 ammo
[4:04:22] <%hdawger> Time to boost that survival stat with some bullshit
[4:04:23] <detritus25> Guns huh...well bye
[4:04:27] <metalliec> pat doesn't know himself confirmed
[4:04:28] <%Mornaka> ANDY NO
[4:04:28] <+Cyoctane> MK reveal hype setting in
[4:04:29] <%joylent_blue> one of the few survival checks
[4:04:31] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> to fuck
[4:04:32] <%dozind16> hes got a cool hat
[4:04:35] <%dozind16> take it
[4:04:36] <%laserbeaming> Didn't this guy give you a perk if you make his checks?
[4:04:36] <+StromkoPenguin> I was 90% sure he wanted to touch tips.
[4:04:37] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @The_Lady_Alustriel there always is
[4:04:40] <ahbhajit> @Kahnicus Haha, I knew it, cuz I had to eat a magazine to pass that check!
[4:04:40] <%LethargicRush> is she getting Emergence'd?
[4:04:41] <detritus25> Get the hat
[4:04:45] <metalliec> have considered eating Jules and taking his hat?
[4:04:46] <Gruhunchously> The Gray
[4:04:47] <%lewdskeletor13> I’m waiting for the next Injustice
[4:04:48] <arcaderabbit48> @TheSpiritof2277 Less than a year, working with a busted engine and assets from FO3, with a limited budget, and Zenimax constantly breathing down their necks with the threat of closing the studio down. Which even after the game came out, they STILL DID because they're fucking Zenimax. This game is fantastic to begin with, and the circumstances jsut make it better.
[4:04:50] <%OwlLightningMage> Crack house
[4:04:52] <%joylent_blue> i'm still not convinced he doesn't want to touch tips
[4:04:53] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> The Gray is an anatomy
[4:04:54] <%Captainahab_37> does pat's character have HUGE boobs?
[4:04:54] <zeroraider> can you survive his dick?
[4:04:55] <%Owkono> rob that hat
[4:04:56] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @ThatGuyfromMars it makes sense. Even not officially sanctioned, they would still exist.
[4:04:57] <%LocDogX86X> honestly it is really good ammo
[4:04:59] <%Remery_> I miss the Ring-a-Ding boys :(
[4:05:01] <$nademonkey1100> all the drugs
[4:05:02] <%SiameseSneeze> oh shit, this mission
[4:05:02] <%xijiy> "Howdy" says the thug
[4:05:03] <+smargh1015> Cerberus were always human supremecist terrorists, the illusive man intentionally surrounded shepard with sympathetic character and put on a good show to veil their real nature
[4:05:05] <ebonifragaria> How grody does Pat's character currently look?
[4:05:10] <arcaderabbit48> The Gray is an alien
[4:05:10] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> I mean fuck they even wrote that organization into Starfleet
[4:05:12] <Dozale> This is Hotel 22.
[4:05:14] <$nademonkey1100> wait isnt this the place with the fisting robot
[4:05:15] <SpikeEffectSatanicSoldier> Oh its this place
[4:05:19] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> maybe you can fuck off shithead
[4:05:19] <%Divryne> Look at this sex dungeon.
[4:05:21] <+StromkoPenguin> @arcaderabbit48 It's almost like they made a better game than Bethesda ever could as a protest.
[4:05:22] <%LethargicRush> maybe you say maybe to often
[4:05:23] <+Grayhammatter> astalos andy?
[4:05:23] <Skydude5> HA
[4:05:24] <Predatorhahaha23000> maybe you need your head popped off
[4:05:24] <detritus25> When you threaten a guy with a AMR
[4:05:25] <%kiiiirsten> @ebonifragaria It looks like if Pat and Boone had a baby and that baby was indifferent to the suffering of the wastes
[4:05:28] <%SpamKingRathalos> Gun his ass down
[4:05:29] <$SGrim> Oh look, it's the whore apartments of South Vegas re-pasted. rooBlank
[4:05:30] <%ElenaManetta> You wanna say that again, I heard your voice crack you little bitch
[4:05:32] <%joylent_blue> i onLY ASKED ONE QUESTION
[4:05:32] <dekkitout> right here! right now!
[4:05:34] <thesoldierofjoy> welp time to start shootin
[4:05:35] <%Kahnicus> @ebonifragaria well it looks just like pat, so you'd probably try to swat it with a newspaper if it were near you
[4:05:37] <dukenux> maybe go fuck ypurself
[4:05:40] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @The_Lady_Alustriel I think they are a little more overt than say, Cerberus. I bet the Council is invested in their own races over the others
[4:05:40] <%lewdskeletor13> Wtf dude
[4:05:41] <Callark> @lewdskeletor13 Courtenay Taylor is the VA you're referring to.
[4:05:42] <Predatorhahaha23000> yeet
[4:05:45] <%LocDogX86X> liar
[4:05:45] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[4:05:47] <%SpamKingRathalos> BAD KARMA

[4:05:56] <mayorrev> Congratulations, you are now Todd Howard
[4:05:57] <AlasterAngelo> BAD KARMA
[4:05:58] <%ThatGuyfromMars> god i miss mass effect
[4:06:01] <%OwlLightningMage> Breaking into crack houses is bad to do
[4:06:03] <Predatorhahaha23000> LUL
[4:06:04] <Gruhunchously> Check under the TV
[4:06:08] <%LethargicRush> jeez this music is creepy
[4:06:10] <%TheSpiritof2277> @arcaderabbit48 I entirely forgot about Zenimax, god yeah, if Bethesda's bad--they're a goliath menace by comparison. Here's hoping Outer Worlds will give a better product without their constricting the writers/devs
[4:06:12] <AlasterAngelo> it really is a shame they haven't made a new Mass Effect since 2
[4:06:12] <arcaderabbit48> @StromkoPenguin Obsidian has gone through an absurd amount over the years, and the fact that they continue to exist in some form and make fantastic games is a miracle unto itself.
[4:06:13] <%pectusumbra> this music is ominous yeah
[4:06:16] <%Captainahab_37> What about breaking into a meth lab?
[4:06:20] <%Kahnicus> brb
[4:06:20] <SpikeEffectSatanicSoldier> Doesn’t someone in this building sell people into slavery? If my memory serves correct
[4:06:20] <%lewdskeletor13> @callark Thanks! Wasn’t she the Fallout 4 protag too?
[4:06:26] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @AlasterAngelo uhhhh.....
[4:06:32] <TalisKanju> Man, synths are the stupidest thing added to Fallout
[4:06:34] <Gruhunchously> Oh dear
[4:06:35] <$Tuskor13> yikes
[4:06:35] <%dozind16> oof
[4:06:38] <detritus25> KILL EM ALL
[4:06:40] <%TombstoneTTromboners> attack
[4:06:41] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @ThatGuyfromMars Yeah I mean there is context and history to the council that Humanity is only just coming to, others get to be more overt simply by existing.
[4:06:43] <arcaderabbit48> @TheSpiritof2277 Pillars of Eternity was great, so I'm really hopeful for Outer Worlds!
[4:06:43] <%joylent_blue> AlasterAngelo i know right? coulda sworn they were gonna go for the trilogy with the ending to 2
[4:06:45] <Predatorhahaha23000> WutFace "good doggie" WutFace
[4:06:46] <alrobot2014> hey there smoothskin
[4:06:47] <%dozind16> smmmmmmmmmmmmmooooooooooooottttttttthhhhhhhhhhhhh
[4:06:48] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> It's a shame Mass Effect is dead
[4:06:49] <+smargh1015> dont worry im sure Anthem will be great Kappa
[4:06:49] <%OwlLightningMage> @lewdskeletor13 I said that earlier. No one remembers LUL
[4:06:51] <%Hazard_Kujacker> S a m R e i g e l
[4:06:51] <%ThePuddingDead> i'd like a carton misty lite menthols plsssss
[4:06:51] <dekkitout> christ mid ghoul is never pretty
[4:06:52] <%kiiiirsten> Wow did they really make a unique model for him
[4:06:52] <%SpamKingRathalos> Fuck this rough skin ghoul
[4:06:52] <dukenux> @spikeeffectsatanicsoldier different building
[4:06:54] <Predatorhahaha23000> smooooooooooooooooooth
[4:06:58] <%Captainahab_37> @TalisKanju what about dragons?
[4:06:58] <%joylent_blue> what the FUCK
[4:06:59] <%Kahnicus> @SpikeEffectSatanicSoldier that's in westside, easy to confuse
[4:07:00] <dukenux> in Westside
[4:07:02] <%Divryne> SPEECH 100
[4:07:02] <MissJenniecide> never trust a dude named scabb
[4:07:04] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @arcaderabbit48 they have some really great talent at Obsidian, even tho their best left
[4:07:05] <%dozind16> hes too smmmoooth
[4:07:07] <+Amplificate> Runs AT you and asks what you're looking at
[4:07:10] <%FrostMass22> It Isn't a shame that Bioware will probably die
[4:07:10] <%SpamKingRathalos> Don't back down, ascend!
[4:07:12] <SpikeEffectSatanicSoldier> Ah okay
[4:07:16] <%sparrrow_> is he a ghoul?
[4:07:17] <KangarooCyborg> What if we didn't have Fallout 4 to cushion the blow and we got Fallout 76 immediately after this?
[4:07:20] <%Divryne> Looks like Alice is into that GHOUL DICK.
[4:07:21] <detritus25> He does know you could blow him to pieces right
[4:07:21] <%TheSpiritof2277> @arcaderabbit48 That was a good indicator for their quality as a standalone studio! I hope so too.
[4:07:22] <SpikeEffectSatanicSoldier> Same layout more or less
[4:07:22] <KRSG> Fuck that guy's face makes me wanna throw up.
[4:07:26] <Predatorhahaha23000> mid ghoulifying looks like he ate out someone with swampass
[4:07:26] <AlasterAngelo> Bioware dying is a mercy at this point
[4:07:26] <ebonifragaria> God, not everything in ME3 was horrible you weenies. Rannoch and Tuchanka were good
[4:07:27] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @FrostMass22 it isn't or isn't it?
[4:07:30] <%Shonen_hero> Bioware has been on borrowed time for a while now
[4:07:35] <ckkc1> T
[4:07:37] <%CubicPhantom> calisthenics
[4:07:38] <%sparrrow_> they think they're behind you
[4:07:39] <%pectusumbra> are we going to see that mom just big shoot this not-child?
[4:07:39] <T_Sasquatch> anthem is out next month and no one cares LUL
[4:07:41] <%dozind16> lag
[4:07:41] <%lewdskeletor13> The original creators of Fallout are making Outer Worlds so I have high hopes
[4:07:41] <zafooru> And they raaaan
[4:07:42] <TalisKanju> @Captainahab_37 Oh yeah, I forgot about that awful AWFUL garbage. You're totally right.
[4:07:43] <dekkitout> i was considering getting anthem, but my hemorrhaging brain cares more for division
[4:07:43] <DSD24> @ebonifragaria Everything with Mordin was the best
[4:07:44] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @The_Lady_Alustriel the only race I can't see having that sorta thing are the Turians, since their military pretty much puts country above self
[4:07:44] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @ebonifragaria Yeah I like a lot of ME3, especially the multiplayer
[4:07:44] <metalliec> @AngriestPat who do you think is cuter, ED-E or WALL-E
[4:07:44] <jabu__jabu> The whole game is so orange
[4:07:45] <%TheSpiritof2277> Veronica is trying her best
[4:07:45] <+Grayhammatter> off they go
[4:07:47] <$Tuskor13> Bethesda btw
[4:07:49] <%joylent_blue> peepoRun
[4:07:49] <alrobot2014> @T_Sasquatch that's next month?
[4:07:50] <AlasterAngelo> They never made an ME3?
[4:07:56] <detritus25> Get the thugs and their kids
[4:07:58] <%SpamKingRathalos> Bioware? More like Bioshit.
[4:07:58] <Gruhunchously> @T_Sasquatch Bets on whether or not Anthem kills Bioware.
[4:07:58] <%lewdskeletor13> She’s doing her best
[4:07:59] <%OwlLightningMage> Bioware is super dead after Anthem doesn't preform to absurd standards
[4:07:59] <Dozale> I mean its nice that Primm got a new Sheriff, Powder Gangers are fucked, man.
[4:08:03] <RipSlamsteak> Isometric exercise! Care to join me?
[4:08:03] <%LethargicRush> its like flexxing your butthole
[4:08:04] <arcaderabbit48> @ThatGuyfromMars Very true. Their best left, but I think they left the company in good hands. The Microsoft buy-up is a little worrying, but things seem okay enough so far that I'm tentatively optimistic.
[4:08:06] <%Captainahab_37> did you hear the good news? Bethesda is FINALLY...working on their engine
[4:08:07] <+nsc410> b a c k o f f
[4:08:13] <KangarooCyborg> Specifically dick stretching
[4:08:13] <%Captainahab_37> for only the 90th time!
[4:08:14] <%ElenaManetta> Third threat in under five minutes
[4:08:15] <%ThePuddingDead> rawr...yeah what ever bitch
[4:08:15] <ZNC1990> I S O M E T R I C exercise
[4:08:16] <%SiameseSneeze> kill em all moon2H
[4:08:16] <zeroraider> I think Veronica took too many cazadore stings
[4:08:17] <%CurrySauseBandit> @KangarooCyborg Too be fair. If 76 released right after this. We'd likely have a better game and had never known 76 was just a multiplayer mod of 4. :v
[4:08:17] <TalisKanju> What gun?
[4:08:22] <%joylent_blue> listen here you little bitch
[4:08:26] <metalliec> -jojo point- "Y O U N E E D T O F U C K O F F"
[4:08:27] <%ElenaManetta> Look, her name is Alice Victim
[4:08:28] <James_Quivers> I still maintain that the ONLY bad thing about ME3 was the ending, everything else was great
[4:08:29] <arcaderabbit48> @Captainahab_37 Wait, really? I thought they were determined to keep it, even moving forward
[4:08:30] <TalisKanju> You don't have a gun in your hand
[4:08:36] <+nsc410> very convincing
[4:08:37] <Gruhunchously> It's a trick
[4:08:38] <Predatorhahaha23000> she looks so shook
[4:08:38] <+Yokuho> Wow that's a shit voice actor if I ever heard one
[4:08:39] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> NOW GLASS HER
[4:08:40] <+SparkAfterDark> Hmm I wonder if this named npc is different than "random squatter 14"
[4:08:40] <dekkitout> i just wanna talk *reaches for gun*
[4:08:41] <Callark> @lewdskeletor13 Yes she was the FO4 protag
[4:08:42] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @ThatGuyfromMars I'm still upset we probably never will get a Turian-based game. best race
[4:08:43] <AlasterAngelo> @James_Quivers I see you've read this message. Good.
[4:08:43] <%joylent_blue> she looks so scared LUL
[4:08:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @arcaderabbit48 I would only be worried if Outer Worlds is less than stellar. But it's gonna be less than stellar since Chris Avellone left
[4:08:44] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> what a dumbass
[4:08:45] <ebonifragaria> @James_Quivers well except for that dumb ninja guy
[4:08:48] <+HoboCabs> she aint got no gun
[4:08:50] <%CubicPhantom> look at this letter entitled "Henchman Letter"
[4:08:52] <+StromkoPenguin> ME3 had major thematic problems even before the end, it just didn't truly screw the pooch until the end.
[4:08:55] <%ElenaManetta> Look at her not reading it
[4:08:56] <Zzross_the_savagezz> @ThatGuyfromMars Don't worry, there will always be Mass Effect. And failing that we'll always have the Citadel DLC and Tali.
[4:08:56] <Predatorhahaha23000> 7 int
[4:08:56] <%joylent_blue> you IDIOT
[4:08:58] <%joylent_blue> VoHiYo
[4:08:58] <detritus25> Just join pat
[4:08:58] <%ElenaManetta> She just guessed what was on the paper.
[4:09:00] <%SiameseSneeze> What do you WANT?!
[4:09:01] <DSD24> Andy's monster face
[4:09:01] <%ThePuddingDead> of course you do
[4:09:03] <%ThePuddingDead> dont
[4:09:03] <$Tuskor13> this VA sucks
[4:09:06] <T_Sasquatch> @alrobot2014 February 22, 2019 LUL exactly my point
[4:09:09] <leonegaming6> typical response LULW
[4:09:09] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> shut up you teenager
[4:09:10] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @The_Lady_Alustriel my favorite part of Andromeda was Vetra. The turians are so cool.
[4:09:10] <%Captainahab_37> @arcaderabbit48 I think they're keeping the same engine, just improving it again
[4:09:13] <%Captainahab_37> IIRC
[4:09:14] <%Mornaka> CAN'T WAKE UP
[4:09:15] <%ElenaManetta> Why. Can't. They. See. My. Paaaaaiiiin.
[4:09:15] <%dozind16> muh pain
[4:09:16] <%TheSpiritof2277> Laura Bailey should have voiced this character
[4:09:17] <dukenux> emoo
[4:09:18] <Yadogari> WAKE ME UP INSIDE
[4:09:18] <James_Quivers> Yes, Kai Leng was dumb lol, but not an important aspect overall. I often forget the guy even existed
[4:09:18] <%AncelDeLambert> this dialogue is badly read, yes
[4:09:19] <AlasterAngelo> MUH PAIN

[4:11:34] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @The_Lady_Alustriel you could probably chaulk that up to EA taking away Bioware Vancouver's money after the game's less than stellar reception.

[4:12:58] <%kiiiirsten> Pat Defeated By Wall
[4:12:59] <jabunthewanderer> `tcl
[4:13:05] <KRSG> The stuttering is because of the Cazadores. Even the Engine doesn't wanna fuck with them.

[4:13:09] <+Grayhammatter> the hugest wall
[4:13:12] <detritus25> PAT VS WALL
[4:13:13] <%OwlLightningMage> Good Money is long but has a 300,000 cap pay off
[4:13:13] <DSD24> @ThatGuyfromMars At least stabbing him in the gut was awesome
[4:13:14] <%Captainahab_37> it really is like vegas
[4:13:15] <Rawsome83> "open world"
[4:13:16] <ZNC1990> yeah, if by "bone" you mean "pick a dialog option, fade to black"
[4:13:16] <%LethargicRush> break the walls doooooown
[4:13:17] <zafooru> ah yes the natural enemy of a pat - a barrier greater than 4 feet in height
[4:13:18] <alrobot2014> that's a gated community
[4:13:20] <Gruhunchously> If you murder enough indigenous creatures for sport, Lucy lets you suck her dick
[4:13:21] <%Jjrossman> walls really do work
[4:13:24] <%Theophilus567> Man. Trump did it. He built that wall.
[4:13:24] <%jiin6> About time pat
[4:13:27] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @DSD24 I still can't believe that's a renegade option
[4:13:29] <%Iwantscandy> Man playing this game with sprint is crazy
[4:13:31] <zafooru> westside west huh
[4:13:31] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @ThatGuyfromMars Yeah that's very likely. I was playing a ton at launch, but soon had a hyper-specific problem that locked me out of the multiplayer entirely on console. When I got to PC the pool was just way too diluted I couldn't ever get any of the interesting characters.I do occasionally go back though and it's always fun
[4:13:33] <arcaderabbit48> Oh yeah, another problem with this part of the game? It makes sense to have such heavily fortified entrances, but it also makes it a major pain in the ass for the player
[4:13:39] <ahbhajit> @ZNC1990 you mean you don't black out when you bone IRL?
[4:13:40] <%austing1011> How swollen is your dick from all that sweet sweet cazador poison pat?
[4:13:41] <Zzross_the_savagezz> He lost to a terminally ill Drell.
[4:13:41] <DSD24> @ThatGuyfromMars Dood its so cool!
[4:13:42] <Dakuu75> Did Veronica ever get that dress?
[4:13:43] <detritus25> Oh just have to go around wall
[4:13:43] <%Kahnicus> it's outside the south entrance methinks
[4:13:43] <dukenux> Westside is da best
[4:13:44] <%Captainahab_37> every playthrough i can never remember where this fucking enterance is
[4:13:44] <KRSG> Ya got another gate.
[4:13:45] <%ThatRandomGuy661> It's outside of westside
[4:13:45] <FracturedImage> theres a big sign above it
[4:13:47] <lotharrio> Check sewers, yeah.
[4:13:49] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat there's a big sign too
[4:13:49] <alrobot2014> the thorn is outside near the other entrance to westside @AngriestPat
[4:13:50] <%joylent_blue> its got big signs pointing at it
[4:13:51] <+SlappyMeats> hey folks, have we eaten people for their pretty dress yet?
[4:13:53] <%Theophilus567> I thought the thorn wasn’t actually in west side.
[4:13:54] <%RNGbob> @AngriestPat out right in front of north exit
[4:13:58] <%Trabnaxes> When will Pat get the PIMPboy3000
[4:14:01] <%Theophilus567> Like it’s on the main map.
[4:14:02] <Gruhunchously> There's a big sign pointing to it.
[4:14:03] <%Kahnicus> go out that one
[4:14:05] <detritus25> NOT INSIDE WESTSIDE
[4:14:07] <arcaderabbit48> Yeah, a manhole
[4:14:08] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @The_Lady_Alustriel yeah, if only EA cared enough. Oh well, what's another dead series to them
[4:14:09] <dukenux> its right next to westsode
[4:14:10] <%joylent_blue> its not IN westside

[4:15:42] <%kiiiirsten> There's a big sign pointing to the entrance that says THE THORN if I remember correctly
[4:15:42] <%TheSpiritof2277> Pat, gonna be real--you were right in front of the sign at the last gate
[4:15:42] <kamerous> There is a big sign outside the south entrance
[4:15:43] <%Shonen_hero> Go back dude, you completely missed it. You were right by it and you turned the other way
[4:15:43] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat you were literally looking right at it at the other entrance you walked out of

[4:16:07] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @DSD24 Shep can be a real bastard in ME3, it actually makes you wonder if he thinks he's doing the right thing, because he's ultimately becoming the bad guy by killing all his friends and dooming a species to extinction

[4:18:00] <+SlappyMeats> Thorn is an anagram of Las Vegas, ya see
[4:18:00] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @The_Lady_Alustriel I dunno, a lot of the stuff they acquire has eventually died out, when they bought Origin, the Ultima games got worse and died, when they bought Pandemic, their games stopped being as good and died. It's just a never ending cycle of mediocrity, I don't trust that EA will give Mass Effect to a good studio.
[4:18:01] <Estuko> and she'll fuck you when you're dead too
[4:18:01] <alrobot2014> her face is actually pretty good in this mod
[4:18:02] <EASrake> You already offended her
[4:18:02] <NME_Dom> Bang Red
[4:18:02] <%ThePuddingDead> she's hot
[4:18:03] <Gruhunchously> She is an edge-lord.
[4:18:03] <+JackMillerTime> wait so she runs a thunderdome?
[4:18:04] <+HavokSCOUT> Might need my tetanus shot after that dialogue
[4:18:04] <DSD24> The Thorn was a gun in Destiny

[4:18:07] <%Remery_> I can be a Chicken Tender :)
[4:18:08] <%Captainahab_37> Offend her super good
[4:18:08] <%sparrrow_> she'll show everyone your balls from the inside
[4:18:08] <dekkitout> uh oh, my linkin park albums are bleeding again...

[4:19:06] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @DSD24 Doing most of the renegade options in 3 makes you as bad as the reapers, you just straight up commit war crimes. It's weird how black and white Mass Effect can be tho
[4:19:06] <DSD24> @Shonen_hero I mean Lilly the Nightkin is pretty cute

[4:19:43] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @ThatGuyfromMars It's quite true that most franchises don't get to survive EA. I think maybe if the next Dragon Age turns out well we possibly could see a new Mass Effect. By that time people should have forgotten

[4:22:08] <EASrake> wow...
[4:22:09] <ZNC1990> having sex with this women is both needlessly complex and deceptively simple
[4:22:09] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @The_Lady_Alustriel Well, Inquisition actually sold well enough, I think it was like 6 million. I don't even know how much Andromeda sold, but looking at how many times it's gone on sale, I doubt half of that. It's just that Casey Hudson wrote himself into a wall with the ambiguity of ME3's ending, and Andromeda's lukewarm response makes it hard to do a Mass Effect game that isn't just a straight up reboot, because they won't do a sequel to Andromeda
[4:22:10] <%joylent_blue> apatBig bravery
[4:22:10] <lotharrio> Big hero moment.

[4:23:25] <%Kahnicus> Pat Fuckboiven, mercenary animal killer.
[4:23:26] <powerprotoman> pat you sat in your cage and killed everything before it left tis cage, that wasnt even worht 1 cap
[4:23:26] <thesoldierofjoy> such brave
[4:23:27] <Dakuu75> LOL shoot through the fucking chain-link fence with your sniper riffle. WHAT A SHOW~ AMAZING~! XD
[4:23:27] <C_S_N_G> So entertaining
[4:23:27] <+Grayhammatter> big brave
[4:23:30] <misterspotswood> @AngriestPat this isnt the quest, the quest is getting eggs for her
[4:23:31] <%LethargicRush> what a good show
[4:23:31] <zeroraider> sugoi patto
[4:23:32] <%TheSpiritof2277> What a brave hero
[4:23:33] <%ElenaManetta> HAHAHA
[4:23:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> You may have misheard me. I want all the radscorpions you have.
[4:23:34] <lotharrio> Bloodcurdling excitement!
[4:23:35] <AlasterAngelo> I'm pretty entertained
[4:23:35] <ShichiNoBushi> BOOOOOO
[4:23:37] <raminnoodle420> @arcaderabbit48 oooo oh ok cool cool
[4:23:40] <+SparkAfterDark> gotta spend money to make money
[4:23:41] <Smaenus> Look at this parkour
[4:23:42] <%CubicPhantom> to be fair this is actually shitty entertainment
[4:23:42] <%OwlLightningMage> LUL
[4:23:44] <%austing1011> Such awe inspiring level of pure unadulterated COWARDICE!!!
[4:23:46] <%joylent_blue> wOW
[4:23:46] <Gruhunchously> But once you do the quest, you can fight three Deathclaws in close quarters, and that's always amusing.
[4:23:46] <detritus25> Totally not OP AF
[4:23:49] <+mastertwin2> NotLikeThis
[4:23:49] <thesoldierofjoy> ooooooh 60
[4:23:49] <TranquilTurnip> I liked the part where he crouched Clap
[4:23:50] <ebonifragaria> WATCH as a man fires a single bullet from the corner!!
[4:23:52] <dukenux> you are now viligied by PETA
[4:23:52] <%EvanTheNewbie> High roller
[4:23:54] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @ThatGuyfromMars Yeah ME is in a very difficult place in terms of writing now. Anything related to Andromeda is likely a no-go and there is a very strict timeline of events in the series, writing in a PC would be weird for most fans. Maybe a canon ending has to happen ala Deus Ex (also RIP)
[4:23:55] <%ElenaManetta> Just chuck the caps at the giant rats at full force and save the ammo
[4:23:56] <EASrake> 69 caps nice
[4:23:58] <%Captainahab_37> it's like working retail all over again!
[4:23:58] <DrDomVonDoom> these are Gamestop prices
[4:23:58] <ZNC1990> dont think of the COIN think of the LOINS
[4:24:00] <%Doster503> That was just kind of an ad for that gun, right?
[4:24:01] <Gruhunchously> Pat what are you doing.
[4:24:02] <jagged203> fighting some of the weakest enemies in the game wouldn't pay well
[4:24:02] <%Captainahab_37> because the pay is shit
[4:24:04] <detritus25> That's one bullet
[4:24:07] <%sparrrow_> Over OP as AF
[4:24:22] <%LethargicRush> whhhhhat
[4:24:23] <+Grayhammatter> WHOA
[4:24:23] <FracturedImage> LUL
[4:24:23] <$SGrim> @ebonifragaria I mean, I'd pay 5 bucks to watch giant bugs get fucked by 50 cal rounds. rooShrug
[4:24:24] <mayorrev> waow

[4:24:28] <%LocDogX86X> fight Cazadors
[4:24:29] <%CubicPhantom> okay that's gotta be worth some caps
[4:24:29] <%kiiiirsten> kablamzo
[4:24:30] <%ElenaManetta> pAT PAT PAT'S OUR MAN, IT'S SO EASY, IT'S A SHAM
[4:24:31] <zeroraider> BTFO'd
[4:24:32] <+mgskomododragon> no glands?
[4:24:33] <raminnoodle420> Wut a s truggle
[4:24:33] <powerprotoman> oh man did you see that it almost left its Cage!
[4:24:34] <dukenux> woaw
[4:24:34] <%OwlLightningMage> Whoa WutFace
[4:24:35] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, the bullets cost more than what you're making from these fights.
[4:24:35] <ahbhajit> riveting
[4:24:36] <DrMoose7> bodied
[4:24:39] <Gorgen> 90 caps
[4:24:42] <Norggron> this was a real disappointment to me cause the arena is my favorite part of bethesda games
[4:24:45] <arcaderabbit48> To be fair, Pat is using a literal fucking cannon
[4:24:45] <%austing1011> Fisticuffs that fucking shit Pat!
[4:24:47] <detritus25> The honor
[4:24:47] <+SlappyMeats> did...did we win?
[4:24:47] <%DesperaDo2077> Now go after deathclaw island
[4:24:51] <%sparrrow_> is Pat gonna do all the Downloadable DLC Content? Kappa
[4:24:53] <%CollinsOfBodom> Primm has a new sheriff
[4:24:55] <%Shonen_hero> ah, nothing like explosives to make things sporting
[4:24:55] <%joylent_blue> lame it out super hard
[4:24:55] <JetpackMcQuack> If they took all your guns, this might be a contedt
[4:25:03] <TranquilTurnip> Can you not fight a deathclaw?
[4:25:04] <$Tuskor13> not even worth 1 explosive bullet
[4:25:06] <thesoldierofjoy> "Shoot these bugs in a barrel to make me wet"- crazy sewer lady
[4:25:08] <%kiiiirsten> @sparrrow_ I believe so, he was asking what the best order to complete them is on twitter
[4:25:09] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat but the stage two fights.., rooCry
[4:25:10] <alrobot2014> GO AND STEAL FROM PREGNANT lNSECTS
[4:25:13] <%Captainahab_37> so that's what women want huh? mantis eggs
[4:25:15] <DrDomVonDoom> Vernoica is super jealous
[4:25:15] <%Doster503> @AngriestPat If the things you kill in the pit drop loot, does taht mean you can kill Mantis to get their eggs?
[4:25:17] <Callark> @AngriestPat Vault 22 Should have some mantis eggs for you
[4:25:17] <detritus25> Cheat like you've never cheated
[4:25:20] <%joylent_blue> ED-E the flying robot is stuck on a railing
[4:25:20] <EASrake> !mods
[4:25:20] <%OwlLightningMage> Release order is best order
[4:25:25] <Smaenus> "It must be a fair fight" Explosive 50 cal rounds lol
[4:25:26] <CrabSlacks> get that lady some asprin
[4:25:28] <ShichiNoBushi> Remember that match with the centurion in the interrogation cell? It could have been like that.
[4:25:29] <Gruhunchously> Wow, this place is full of edgelords.
[4:25:29] <zeroraider> bitches love eggs
[4:25:29] <%austing1011> Is this the new Fisticuffs episode?
[4:25:34] <Dakuu75> jesus... that was creepy... "I hurt all over" sounds like withdrawl
[4:25:34] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @The_Lady_Alustriel yeah but Invisible War handled that poorly though (Fuck Human Revolution and MD were really good though). I'd accept a full reboot just ignoring the events of the original ME series, as long as Casey Hudson stays miles away from it, as long as it's got a cool turian I can romance or be bros with, I'm down with whatever
[4:25:45] <ZNC1990> dat oblivion
[4:25:45] <lotharrio> ...is ED-E actually following?
[4:25:49] <sdgundum990> the school building in the opening town will have some too
[4:25:51] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat they're in there deep
[4:25:54] <Gorgen> Oh its not that bad
