[0:25:09] <%legendfather_of_giants> but DS4 is so muh better @AngriestPat
[0:25:09] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer1000 Considering how much of a super-boner you have for Resident Evil, I am not even slightly surprised Capcpom (yes that is intentional) gave you it early. I am also extremely jealous, as I never got to play it as a kid, as my parents were convinced playing games like that at a young age would make me a super-murder-rapist with gonorr-herpa-syphil-AIDS. The fact I made that joke means they already pretty much failed as parents.
[0:25:09] <+VektorTroika> Pat is part of the PC Mustard Race

[1:03:42] <TheBigO75> CRAZY TALU
[1:03:42] <Rhinoprotoss> BUT WHAT IF I NEED IT ?
[1:03:43] <KasGiD> How long till Pat dies
[1:03:43] <bilzin> isn't health items ammunition for your hp?
[1:03:44] <%kamen_advent> Only use health items for bosses and in the rare cases you need to

[1:03:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> Crazy talk activate
[1:03:51] <TheAspiringWriter> That....actually makes sense
[1:03:53] <Junkfist> Pro-Tip, never use health items so you have many health items
[1:03:53] <%PhysicsLB> So Europe
[1:03:53] <SchroedingersFerret> Don't use items in battle, don't use temporary buffs.
[1:03:53] <%PenmanLupine> he's doing the Code Veronica shit
[1:03:53] <+DesertOfSand> I mean, Paris is in Europe
[1:03:53] <Meekest> He's doing a big investigate
[1:03:54] <+Katalist_> Don't tell me how many healing items to take.
[1:03:54] <Valdorick> Put health items away - don't get hit - carry more bulelts
[1:03:54] <%st_judge> Paris not Europe huh?
[1:03:55] <Hellarussian> thats Europe tho
[1:03:55] <CapCorn123> Pat's right but he's gonna choke

[1:15:33] <CrabSlacks> acid rounds are rally powerful
[1:15:34] <AggsMK7> Even civilians pack heavier than a 5 shot 9mm snub nose

[1:16:02] <Valdorick> H-how does... What makes "1 gunpowder" here? And how does smacking "two gunpowder" into each other make bullet?
[1:16:03] <NarcolepticGoose> make the cool wolf ammo
[1:16:03] <Parapattern> Cops LOVE to use acid rounds
[1:16:04] <haisho> it'll make sense later okay

[1:56:30] <%Kahnicus> @TheBrazilianHope They die faster but still get up even with headshots, it's dumb.

[1:56:55] <devanmuse> if headshots are useless, just go for the legs
[1:56:58] <GyroBrando> still better than jormal body shots
[1:56:59] <mastermidget23> Someone online mentioned that the bullets do more damage if you wait for the crosshair to focus? I don't know if that's true.

[1:57:25] <SnaKemuho> gun crits at random, damage is static
[1:57:26] <KiroKadura> If you wait for the aim to focus and aim at the forehead it should take about 3 shots
[1:57:26] <Kataguro> Pat will use the pistol the whole game to save
[1:57:29] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Sparkshot? That's new.
[1:57:29] <+blastazoid26> Box simulator 2019

[1:57:30] <%Reizie_Etherealm> If going for headshots doesn't pay off then just spam body shots until they go down, just dump 2 clips into 'em
[1:57:31] <Ocaz> @aperez928 dont tell me what im thinking or the cadence of my opinion. I dont know you so please respect me before you call things wrongly.
[1:57:31] <%sleepy_coffee> why would a police department need a gernade launcher? i mean Raccoon City doesn't like a place that would need riot supression.
[1:57:31] <$SleepyMaribo> fuck the bow gun
[1:57:31] <%Kahnicus> Wait, Sparkshot? She can restore all her ammo by Super dashing?
[1:57:32] <%zerocruz> ZAPPING

[2:08:26] <andreslazo8> I guess at that point in the original you never used it again
[2:08:27] <yuribo26> Jebaited
[2:08:28] <+dodge_and_dust> why would you not just stoe the bolt cutters in case you need them?
[2:08:28] <F1NG3RS> Aww yee!

[2:08:38] <XxCGxOblivionxX> M79 noise is pure sex
[2:08:40] <Crushter> There was a Licker Claw mark, so I bet you're right
[2:08:40] <%abadbadman> Licker I barely know her
[2:08:41] <+dodge_and_dust> does it not let you discard key items that have future uses?
[2:08:41] <haisho> well this IS RE2. Gotta kill Lickers eventually
[2:08:41] <arcaderabbit48> Give him some LICK
[2:08:41] <TheEnablerr> I hope it's the most anticlimactic shit
[2:08:42] <$NocturneNovember> Did Pat just lose the bolt cutters forever?
[2:08:42] <+MagicianV3> @Mikatonic it means the item has no more uses theres nothing else to do with it
[2:08:43] <vingadivo> get L I C C
[2:08:43] <wolf_hurricane> Do Lickers give good blowjobs?
[2:08:45] <TheAspiringWriter> Prepare your asshole
[2:08:45] <razdoop> A Cherry Licker??
[2:08:45] <+Alig200> any item with a red tick is useless and can be discarded.
[2:08:46] <allanmiri> lickity split
[2:08:46] <sarg1010> @AngriestPat How different is the remake to the original?

[2:08:52] <+Buzzard42> Man this looks like they just fuckin shoved RE2 into the RE7 engine
[2:08:53] <bearodactyl_raptor1> Feels the licks
[2:08:54] <rearedlogarithm> I approve of coward saving, from one coward to another.
[2:08:54] <hassanico> Y'all realize you can ONLY discard items after you can't use them anymore right?
[2:08:55] <SnaKemuho> you can't discard key items if they're useful you 3s
[2:08:57] <allanmiri> slurp
[2:09:02] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Just remember to use the flashbang when you run into the Licker
[2:09:02] <$Mendin> A can of fizz, it's sure to yellow and mellow those things
[2:09:04] <Gruhunchously> @wolf_hurricane I heard they do great cunnilingus

[2:09:22] <UnfilteredComic> monkaGIGA
[2:09:23] <andreslazo8> Oh that's smart if the game only lets you get rid of key items when they're no longer useful
[2:09:23] <+kawachipto> @buzzard42 yes, that's what everyone wanted
[2:09:24] <$Mendin> @grayjammer Crazy Talk exists, nobody can prove Pat wrong more than Pat

[3:28:27] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> CRAFTING
[3:28:27] <+justarthur0> the creators did say they changed shit up though
[3:28:28] <Heyestus> They don't make Vases like that anymore I tells ya

[3:28:35] <%Prism_Wing> @yourliteraldog Fire WILL be defeated.
[3:28:35] <%sparrrow_> 3 for chat is wrong
[3:28:38] <$Mendin> Suddenly, I want a can of nice cold, fizzy, Mellow Yellow
[3:28:38] <yourliteraldog> white gunpowder
[3:28:39] <+brickwall35> whoever tagged me, I was saying the vase was in the same room as the heart key
[3:28:40] <patismyhero> Missed almost nothing
[3:28:43] <+MyDarkStorm> RNG
[3:28:44] <%FracturedImage> How can you use this crafting system but not use the one in new vegas??????
[3:28:44] <Icecreammouth> Would shooting enemies with acid rounds first ignite them harder with flame rounds?
[3:28:45] <%Prism_Wing> 3
[3:28:46] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat I thought you DIDN'T LIKE CRAFTING
[3:28:47] <%xemnahort> I know what I’m getting on my next paycheck
[3:28:48] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat I think they want you to comment on the big fucking Dodo
[3:28:48] <+Floorislava> zap crafting system
[3:28:50] <majindusto> Getting better?
[3:28:50] <zafooru> 1d2+1
[3:28:50] <TakesGuts> chat is gay tonight
[3:28:50] <%Laecerelius> 1 = Pat's wrong, 2 = Paige's wrong, 3 = chat's wrong
[3:28:51] <+MagicianV3> @Hanbei1708 1 means is his fault 2 means is paige is gfs and 3 means its chats
[3:28:51] <Funky_Honkey> so the crafting can proc an extra round sometimes, nice
[3:28:53] <xeros720> that's gonna be a perk for the Rogue mode
[3:28:54] <TheBlankAce> Time to manipulate rng
[3:28:56] <%Kahnicus> @ThePuddingDead It's like Batman growing scruff the farther the story progressed in Arkham Asylum!
[3:28:58] <Pseudonymity> fucking RNG
[3:28:59] <Hanbei1708> lol
[3:28:59] <%Ciphris> @angriestpat are they dumbasses if they successfully got you to waste time?
[3:29:00] <Skeleton_Boner_Lord> Re3 confirmed
[3:29:00] <TheEnablerr> that seems abusable
[3:29:01] <popooppaix1> Dodos rule
[3:29:01] <+Grayhammatter> the zapting system
[3:29:03] <lloyddboy> 0 = elmo's fault
[3:29:05] <AMajorTom> Put it all into luck
[3:29:08] <HowlJames> White Gunpowder White Powder you do the rest
[3:29:09] <Yummy_Nukes> @angriestpat just assume that like 75% of the chat is always wrong
[3:29:13] <MyNameIsRasus> 1 is Pat is wrong, 2 is Paige is wrong, 3 is chat is wrong
[3:29:13] <drewslo> 1 hour till release
[3:29:14] <zafooru> elmo can never be at fault, so 0 is clearly fuggins is wrong
[3:29:15] <chewgumma22> Pat sees dodos everyday. No biggue
[3:29:15] <%NME_Dom> its either RNG, or its a deminishing return on the same type
[3:29:15] <@mothmandraws> just wait for speedrunners
[3:29:16] <einSynd> You crafted different amounts of handgun bullets in the demo
[3:29:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> Interesting maybe its that AI thing
[3:29:18] <@mothmandraws> timing that ammo
[3:29:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> @toynota10 I believe there is unlimited potential for enemies to get back up after some time.
[3:29:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fucc
[3:29:20] <%CerberusDriver> here we go
[3:29:21] <%sparrrow_> @AngriestPat May your heart by your guiding key

[5:51:09] <Gruhunchously> A child born in 98 is now old enough to drink. Not letting it set it.
[5:51:10] <Hyphixsys> @SaltyJedi you can play the scenerio, either or with Leon or Claire
[5:51:14] <ospreyworks> Just the two paths?

[5:52:42] <%13ry4n93> @ospreyworks statistically there had to be at least one decent person working for Umbrella

[5:52:57] <%FracturedImage> playthrough ruined
[5:52:58] <%OwlLightningMage> Troy Baker plays Sherry LUL
[5:53:03] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @13ry4n93 yeah. Chris
[5:53:04] <d_k_xardas> I m unironically expecting HUNK to be Troy
[5:53:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @fruit_pie_the_magician but what about the orphan kid
[5:53:06] <Hanbei1708> let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into
[5:53:06] <eco419> opening of re outbreak fukin rats in a sewage
[5:53:08] <Guardiansaiyan> @13ry4n93 why did he have to die tho? Now there are no more decent people left in Umbrella
[5:53:08] <Ciglossonjr> That dude begging for his friends life took me from grinning to straightfaced real quick
[5:53:16] <+timblenaut> big yellow gun on her back looks good
[5:53:19] <%lewdskeletor13> Hunk has the same voice actor as original
[5:53:19] <Ciglossonjr> That was fucking something
[5:53:23] <ospreyworks> Yeah, being an Umbrella goon must suck
[5:53:28] <Zalthia> Didnt they get non-unionized va’s for this game?
[5:53:28] <arcaderabbit48> I mean, the plague traveled by rat too. Not unheard of, especially in a big city like this
[5:53:29] <Guardiansaiyan> @ThatGuyfromMars Chris doesn't count...he is on loan
[5:53:32] <Gruhunchously> I guess even Umbrella goons have people they care about.
[5:53:34] <falseeyed> Ellen Page plays Marvin
[5:53:44] <Ciglossonjr> The guy must've been his best friend
[5:53:44] <+MaxterDragon2949> What up pat! what did i miss?

[5:53:47] <eco419> LUL
[5:53:49] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Guardiansaiyan you hush D:<
[5:53:49] <waifoong98> What a Sewer Kappa
[5:53:50] <+runegod20> being a generic goon for any organization must suck, good or bad
[5:53:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The orphan kids were experiments, not directly caused by either
[5:53:54] <%lewdskeletor13> Keith Silverstein voices Hunk
[5:54:01] <Run44forrest> Sherry still sleeping in trash rn
[5:54:01] <Naho_Saenoki> @d_k_xardas HUNK is voiced by the same guy who always voiced him: Keith Silverstein.
[5:54:02] <ospreyworks> Like, it's impossible to not feel a little sympathy for people whose bosses see them as entirely expendable.
[5:54:06] <ospreyworks> It's too real.
[5:54:07] <Hyphixsys> @ospreyworks yep, most of the people that work for them are kept in the dark, and just get sent in some nebulous missions. That;s pretty much how the operate
[5:54:07] <Futuretimetraveller> Extra-large Sewer area. Always a plus
[5:54:08] <Ciglossonjr> Yeah
[5:54:10] <bitjama> where the GATOR
[5:54:13] <eco419> Who said That??
[5:54:26] <%RaikenTB> ORC sucked

[5:54:27] <+TankMunky> Welp, downloading the game now. Money well spent.
[5:54:29] <%13ry4n93> so you'd be an Elite mook?
[5:54:31] <%OwlLightningMage> Except for all the ones that die though LUL
[5:54:34] <+DGenerator> He's the GRIM REAPER and even HQ's like "shit you're alive lol"
[5:54:34] <%jonesyboy_19> Well the USS were a tight group of Security operatives so it makes sense that they would develop a close think of the a private version of Seal team 6
[5:54:35] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> If they're so badass, why are they dead?
[5:54:35] <+MalwareProductions> this game looks gorgeous.
[5:54:36] <lotharrio> What about the mercs Umbrella hires?
[5:54:38] <Gruhunchously> @falseeyed I would have expected Phil LaMarr to play Marvin
[5:54:38] <StonerStan101> What did I miss?!
[5:54:38] <Guardiansaiyan> @ThatGuyfromMars ...you WANT Chris to be part of Umbrella? Now that Wesker is gone Chris won't even get deferential treatment..he might not even get dental...WESKER GAVE CHRIS DENTAL!

[5:55:06] <ospreyworks> Wesker actually making sure his team had vision and dental
[5:55:06] <Fien111> Being a generic goon in Umbrella is actually the better option. You just turn into a basic zambo. The hiring ups get FUCKED UP
[5:55:06] <%13ry4n93> that guy just will not give up!

[5:59:59] <+dawsfloss> whats in the locker???
[5:59:59] <+runegod20> mac 10s were actually made to use a custom silencer since it would help the recoil a ton
[6:00:00] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @eco419 ALLEGEDLY
[6:00:03] <%ThatGuyfromMars> NOOO
[6:00:04] <Fien111> Now your smg can mildly irritate zambos stealthily!

[6:00:26] <slothslayer828> Mr X sucks chesse off the floor
[6:00:28] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Breakfast_Megapowers Early copy, but with how long stream has been, it's released now
[6:00:30] <eldritchmoeblob> @Guardiansaiyan that's correct
[6:00:31] <Guardiansaiyan> Save before killing MARVIN
[6:00:31] <Ciglossonjr> My mother used to live near the guy who invented the Mac-10 when she was growing up
[6:00:31] <Gruhunchously> Randy Pitchford "Yeah I should probably get rid of this USB"
[6:00:33] <Jreedzz> Dont leave that usb in a mideval restraunt now!
[6:00:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yoo

[6:00:37] <%lewdskeletor13> @angriestpat you can drop the USB off at Medieval Times
[6:00:39] <thatd00doverthere> wow
[6:00:40] <Scharfster> wow
[6:00:40] <laguerrilha> cool
[6:00:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> It had a stock
[6:00:42] <CaptainDictator> @RageKingDomo reduces report and blast at muzzle, more pleasant to shoot
[6:00:43] <ithirstforfreddurst> MAC-11 RUSH
[6:00:43] <%Gorgen> it already had one
[6:00:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> they just unfolded it
[6:00:45] <dukenux> Now you go full tactikool
[6:00:47] <%Bane_Kaikyo> magic stock from nowhere
[6:00:47] <%13ry4n93> we all know silences make stocks grow from the back of a gun
[6:00:48] <OubasteGaming> noice
[6:00:53] <TheHeroAppears> LUL
[6:00:53] <FourLeafLover> The stock was always there

[6:01:00] <$Chatterbox1991> Now it's the mac 11 from L4D2
[6:01:00] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I don't know how to feel about this since I played RE 1 2 and Remake like 7 times last week LOL
[6:01:01] <CptJackySparra> Mr X is scooping up his internal organs off the floor LUL
[6:01:02] <FourLeafLover> Just wasn't retracted
[6:01:08] <Buka_Zero> did that say it was .380? no wonder it takes so many shots
[6:01:08] <ZNC1990> MAC-10s are actually easier to use with the supressor, because you can grip it like a rifle. also after firing for a while the supressor unscrews slightly, meaning you HAVE to hold it or it droops and diverst the bullets
[6:01:11] <%RageKingDomo> that must be a heavy fucking suppressor if youre calling it a counterweight
[6:01:13] <%13ry4n93> @Guardiansaiyan weekend at burnies marvin
[6:01:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @leviathan666303 Actually, the MAC-10 comes in .380.
[6:01:14] <%OwlLightningMage> The stock was at your side all along. Your true mentor
[6:01:15] <%jonesyboy_19> Now that its silenced you can go shoot Vincent coming out of the bathroom
[6:01:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Guardiansaiyan marvin wants to hug us

[6:02:20] <EmpressMoth> Library @AngriestPat
[6:02:22] <CaptainDictator> @RageKingDomo It depends, steel supressors DO add quite a bit of weight, which on a machine pistol can be a good thing, considering the recoil. Titanium suppressors are considerably lighter
[6:02:22] <%bigdumbidiotguy> that film is important
[6:02:23] <leviathan666303> remeber szf
[6:02:23] <jackktrue> then hunk ate tofu
[6:02:27] <%bigdumbidiotguy> super important
[6:02:29] <ospreyworks> Nemesis will just be a conga line of Bloodborne-looking monstrosities
[6:02:29] <Jreedzz> lol
[6:02:30] <RiverBirch> Thats a weird lookin shotgun
[6:02:31] <hsp_hiram> can we take a sec to appreciate how good a boy Elmo is being
[6:02:35] <+DGenerator> This has been a fun stream guys
[6:02:36] <yosukecchi> what can't claire do? mix medicines, develop film, she's like a walmart cashier
[6:02:38] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> This game looks great though
[6:02:39] <vegetablespy> can clair hold the mac 10 sideways now? To counter the recoil and use it
[6:02:40] <%13ry4n93> take a shot every time pat goes the wrong way
[6:02:43] <Guardiansaiyan> @Breakfast_Megapowers take some weed and when you play it you can think of yourself as getting infected...might make you play faster if you do while in the dark if your worried that the game might burn you out...
[6:02:43] <%aishman> Hey Pat, just came back from DnD night. Hows the game so far?

[6:51:55] <rockdash> Drink your bullets, pat
[6:52:00] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Its like that in MOST RE games though
[6:52:00] <clonexsniperx> also limited saves
[6:52:03] <eco419> this looks hard
[6:52:04] <em0t10nalr3ck> You're playing on Normal? I thought you were the RE master.
[6:52:05] <%Divryne> Drown in ammo scrub.
[6:52:07] <EmpressMoth> The plants are the worst @AngriestPat

[6:52:25] <vedammi> pat youre really good at resident evil dont stop
[6:52:36] <eco419> it was
[6:52:38] <laguerrilha> Playing on hardcore would make the experience more stressful than fun.

[6:52:54] <laguerrilha> Stream was great <3

[6:52:56] <nina9669> almost 4k people were watching
[6:52:57] <jj_cabo> its fine.big fun

[6:53:00] <eco419> yeyeye
[6:53:01] <MrDonTacos_> it was fun FeelsGoodMan
[6:53:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> it was fun
[6:53:06] <+SoarFlyer> Pat was on the stream?
[6:53:08] <+BurritoArcade> What's up with the RedBull sponsorship? I only drink it because of you
[6:53:13] <Desertfishing> IT was good, I'll never buy because im a huge coward and wouldn't last
[6:53:16] <ebonifragaria> @Ciglossonjr You should probably see a doctor
[6:53:17] <em0t10nalr3ck> You better show some Hunk boi
[6:53:19] <DXLelouch24> i thought Pat was gonna stream 24/7 RE2?
[6:53:22] <eco419> Who said that ?
[6:53:23] <DXLelouch24> guess he doesnt care enough
[6:53:26] <CptJackySparra> Stream was dope. You're allowed to get immersed during the first play through. Looks like they done it real justice
[6:53:30] <MrDonTacos_> woo
[6:53:35] <Ciglossonjr> @ebonifragaria Never
[6:53:38] <eco419> woo

[6:54:05] <%ssjklyco> They need to release DLC that is just the original RE 2 or a fully remade RE 1.5
[6:54:16] <42nfl19> pat how hyped would you be if they somehow finagle some type of coop?
[6:54:22] <em0t10nalr3ck> Hunk's scenario is pretty tense in this remake.
[6:54:23] <laguerrilha> Guys, this will be a RE2 channel for the next week. No need to play all at once
[6:54:23] <%DavidSanChan> skipped stream to enjoy game later, and draw pat's butt

[6:58:05] <Desertfishing> I like to use FAQs spoilers arent a deal breaker
[6:58:06] <%NWR_James> My father let me play 10 mintues of shadow warrior. Then he saw it. And then it disappeared
[6:58:06] <Sielas> I'm playing Tides of Numenera with a walkthrough, because there's SO MUCH missable stuff
[6:58:11] <eco419> no internet guides
[6:58:12] <Longfang91> *question. Ugh
[6:58:13] <+SoarFlyer> I'm too worried about doing something "wrong"
[6:58:16] <+Mittensbro> @TheAspiringWriter honestly I think Bethesda desperately wants to forget F:NV because it makes all of their games look much worse by comparison
[6:58:33] <linkoftermina> it depends on the point of the game - if the Point is exploration then i wouldnt use a guide
[6:58:39] <+xlxviciousxlx> as long as you're having fun, then who gives a fuck!
[6:58:46] <linkoftermina> ^ ye
[6:58:49] <John_Fukerbutt> when i was a young babby and we had a wii my parents got me mad world and i had no idea how to beat it without a guide

[7:03:28] <em0t10nalr3ck> Capgod ain't back until they remake Nemesis and Outbreak
[7:03:36] <%DavidSanChan> when's Redbull emote
[7:03:40] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @angriestpat With how incredibly successful RE2 has been, do you think this'll guarantee R3Make, Dino Crisis Remake, and other franchises to make a return?
[7:03:47] <%kabermano> @Rorinator Hey good luck with your thesis bud
[7:03:49] <+xlxviciousxlx> outbreak remake and I'm sold
[7:03:49] <ebonifragaria> Change your green screen background to redbull Kappa
[7:03:50] <+emperor_z> I would love an Outbreak remake. That game was tragically before its time
[7:04:02] <eco419> big dissapoint?
[7:04:05] <Desertfishing> no Kendo
[7:04:09] <laguerrilha> Yeah i wanted to see more of the city
[7:04:13] <%FracturedImage> I wish SH was remade into this style
[7:04:17] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat I managed to get both Silent Hills 2 and 3 for like 25 bucks, but none of them are the greatest hits version, did I do bad?
[7:04:21] <EmpressMoth> I want Zombie BRad :( @AngriestPat
[7:04:23] <%ssjklyco> Megaman Legends Remake next
[7:04:24] <%willjar313> @emperor_z That WOULD be pretty fuckin' cool...
[7:04:25] <%Rorinator> @kabermano thanks man, feel like I need it.
[7:04:26] <CptJackySparra> See Mr X disemboweled?

[7:04:29] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 7h 4m.
[7:04:31] <em0t10nalr3ck> Outbreak was my first time experiencing Resident Evil and I loved it so much
[7:04:36] <korpocalypse> @AngriestPat so you guys played rese1 like 900 years ago, do yo u plan on playing that at all/soon?
[7:04:36] <jackktrue> lmao Maxi's losing his shit rn @AngriestPat
[7:04:38] <eco419> Mr X ;_;
[7:04:39] <+MagicianV3> mistys still cute

[7:04:49] <+MagicianV3> shes a zombie but those jean shorts though
[7:04:52] <Run44forrest> re outbreak looks cool wish i could play it
[7:05:05] <Desertfishing> I was hoping for some Kendo hitting up on Clair
[7:05:05] <%ThePuddingDead> he hasnt hit Mr X yet, he's about to tho
[7:05:10] <eco419> re outbreak is ok
[7:05:20] <laguerrilha> Oh god imagine spiders with this realism
[7:05:21] <Xenioplate> I haven't seen Mr X yet
[7:05:22] <%jiin6> Jerk Spiders
[7:05:28] <Xbninja13> Lickers make up for the spiders, I hate em
[7:05:29] <Buka_Zero> man fuck spiders
[7:05:32] <Worldbrand> Yeah but I like spiders
[7:05:34] <eco419> ewww
[7:05:35] <%RaikenTB> it sucks.
[7:05:38] <Xenioplate> I always miss that part in people
[7:05:39] <+Nomicro4u> I like the spiders scare people
[7:05:41] <FeedbacK7777> moth tho
[7:05:42] <+emperor_z> Ever? Like, even if you lingered around them?
[7:05:44] <Xenioplate> 's streams
[7:05:44] <%RaikenTB> they were though.
[7:05:46] <em0t10nalr3ck> I hate spiders but I wish they were in the game
[7:05:48] <Valdorick> The spiders seemed like they were legit put in there for "What about people who hate spiders though!?"
[7:05:49] <%vincerocmm> changes for better
[7:05:56] <%jiin6> Less is more
[7:06:02] <%valriot> Mr.X makes up for any loss of enemy variety
[7:06:02] <vedammi> I MISSED THE LICKER
[7:06:05] <Desertfishing> @AngriestPat you think there gonna be naked zombies in the lab?
[7:06:07] <+Nomicro4u> What about people who hate zombies?
[7:06:20] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Hey! I got back just in time to hear him thank me :D
[7:06:22] <+emperor_z> Big floppy zombie dongs
[7:06:29] <MrDonTacos_> oh no
[7:06:29] <Worldbrand> I imagine at least part of this game would be a power fantasy for people who hate zombies
[7:06:29] <+xlxviciousxlx> I hate spiders in real life. but in video games or movies they're not that scary to me.
[7:06:30] <eco419> LUL

[7:17:44] <cisealnine> If only Obsidian could make another Fallout.
[7:17:46] <%ssjklyco> Fallout British Land
[7:17:47] <$birdfella> FALLOUT MEXICO?!
[7:17:48] <gluemanofficial> We should get a fallout game in Chicago, which has never happened before no matter what you say about it

[7:19:00] <$QueequegTheater> Spec Ops The Line stream when
[7:19:00] <%ssjklyco> Fallout Outbreak
[7:19:04] <ebonifragaria> The nuclear apocalypse doesn't happen to Texas; Texas happens to the nuclear apocalypse
[7:19:05] <19DarkKnight87> I can't wait to get my hands on this game. Looks fucking intense.
[7:19:09] <cisealnine> @birdfella the big thing about Fallout is because of it's 1960's Americana... however Fallout New Mexico would be viable.
[7:19:14] <+Doctor_Stew> I'm not sure if I trust that lampshade
[7:19:28] <em0t10nalr3ck> Pat would probably want a CVX remake first, he doesn't really care about Outbreak

[7:22:12] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @angriestpat Can we get a Sea-Bass mod that replaces Leon?
[7:22:14] <+Alig200> gotta remember that RE7 used the RE engine, and it had no mods, so it may take a little while for mods to be created, if they even do at all.
[7:22:15] <%IDTheftVictim> Did they change the crank sound on you too?
[7:22:15] <TheAspiringWriter> @AngriestPat Hey did you know that if you get a zombies arms and legs all shot off it'll just be a squirming torso trying to bite you.
