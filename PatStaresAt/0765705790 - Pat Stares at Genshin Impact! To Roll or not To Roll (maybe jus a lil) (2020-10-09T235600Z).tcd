[0:24:27] <%SirKeigan> Yea
[0:24:28] <fuji_92> try anything once
[0:24:28] <%chubbypencil> It tough to get curds in USA
[0:24:29] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Go the La banquise if you can, but theres a few other good places too
[0:24:31] <%dekkitout> Wisconsin tho?
[0:24:31] <%SirKeigan> Gotta actually be curds
[0:24:31] <%Typhaeon> Chaud Take: Poutine is better with country-style white gravy
[0:24:34] <@SoFarFetched> yeah cheese curds is important
[0:24:41] <%arancet> its REALLY hard to get cheese curds in a lot of areas of the us
[0:24:41] <Badgerconda_> stop saying it like that you dumb quebecois
[0:24:42] <MattoBii> otherwise it's gravy cheese fries
[0:24:44] <scrublord009> wtf is cheese curd?
[0:24:44] <RetroCop87> Has to be turkey gravy, NOT BEEF
[0:24:47] <%oniwahoo> "Putsin" ??
[0:24:47] <%SirKeigan> Because they melt to a certain consistency?
[0:24:49] <OkamiDude15> cheese curds made from the best cheese. american choese Kappa
[0:24:52] <%Ranryu692> cheese "curds" sounds gross
[0:24:53] <JaceDarkstar> potine is the shit. its just hard to get good curds in florida
[0:24:54] <@ShockzNDrawe> Thats not true we got several poutine places out here
[0:24:58] <Brainmilkshake> grabbed some when we visited BC, they had the curds!
[0:24:58] <%goatbait> brown saucce?
[0:25:00] <+dave323dave> brown sauce its saucy and brown
[0:25:01] <Pixel_Butts> i understand that cheese curds are illegal in parts of the US
[0:25:06] <%SirKeigan> Brown sauce?
[0:25:07] <MattoBii> is there a reason you say "poutsin" instead of "pou-teen"
[0:25:12] <%chubbypencil> LOTS of regulations on curds
[0:25:12] <Solidnick18> cheese curds Kreygasm wisconsin has the best
[0:25:12] <%Idziman> I love curds so much
[0:25:13] <RetroCop87> they sell them in northern states
[0:25:13] <scrublord009> WTF IS A CHEESE CURD
[0:25:14] <UlriktheSlayer1> yeah cheese curds arent very common
[0:25:15] <%rdark_ksu> turkey not beef? huh thats new
[0:25:18] <AMajorTom> How squeaky 1-10
[0:25:18] <%Typhaeon> I have a local poutine place that uses proper curd, moreso in the midwest
[0:25:18] <%SirKeigan> Illegal some may say
[0:25:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> I legit pronounce poutine like Poontang
[0:25:20] <%crimsonharvest> Do the cheese curds need to squeek when you bite them?
[0:25:24] <%ryome> cheese curds are heavily regulated
[0:25:25] <drewslo> illegal in US for no reason
[0:25:25] <+DoctorDerp388> sauce brr
[0:25:26] <%SirKeigan> @scrublord009 Never heard of curds and whey?
[0:25:27] <+metalicblackcherry> @PatStaresAt can the fries be steak fries? Or is that a crime?
[0:25:27] <RayCSmooth> so it's brown sause
[0:25:28] <%dekkitout> Curds seem like a mid west us thing
[0:25:31] <Dragon_Batman> Aah sauce brruurn
[0:25:31] <%ssjklyco> So yes, it's brown sauce
[0:25:32] <%AncelDeLambert> ... so it's brown sauce
[0:25:35] <fuji_92> putin
[0:25:36] <UlriktheSlayer1> "poo-teen"

[0:29:58] <trackles_64> Tipping is the worst
[0:30:00] <%Typhaeon> Don't be nice to people, problem solved Kappa
[0:30:01] <%shadowace2400> we're happier
[0:30:02] <Badgerconda_> Americans = less polite, more friendly, compared to Canadians.

[0:30:25] <+lucaflowe> We're always smiling more because we're glad to be out of america
[0:30:26] <%ryome> We smile more AT PEOPLE, which no one does as much
[0:30:27] <Dragon_Batman> Yea that makes sense
[0:30:28] <%Daniel_Is_I> I have no fucking idea what places do and don't tip.
[0:30:29] <%hrodbehrat> If I ever meet you Pat, I'm going to smile at you until you cry

[0:36:09] <%Ranryu692> Madden totally has Gacha in the MUT mode
[0:36:11] <+MarxNoJutsu> tell Paige that 14 is free up until Heavensward, I'm certain no-one has ever mentioned that

[0:36:16] <scrublord009> she is busy having title matches against the neighbours
[0:36:19] <%AquilaHarukaze> big reason is it's free
[0:36:19] <2DSuperiority> EA games you don't pull pretty bois or waifus
[0:36:26] <%SirGO0SE> thats a really fucking good point
[0:36:29] <%Daniel_Is_I> And Genshin is FUN.
[0:36:30] <%kewlmyc> People are shitting on Mihoyo though.

[0:36:42] <GloriousMost> 100 Canadian to get ass fucked with gacha? no thanks
[0:36:43] <%oniwahoo> Also EA has been trash for fucking years
[0:36:43] <+ZoltanBMagnus> football players are also not as appeasing to look at like a waifu or husbando
[0:36:45] <+dolphinbj> but you can spend $60 on this game and get NOTHING

[0:37:38] <%BubbaRands> If EA had waifus I'd think again...but I don't think Lebron is a good waifu
[0:37:39] <DianaTheAscian> maker
[0:37:39] <%crimsonharvest> also just fuck EA in general
[0:37:40] <suikudo> @PatStaresAt doggy snore

[0:37:47] <%Bmrandfriends> they just take the asseta of all your favorite games
[0:37:47] <%ZakGaiGar> if sports had waifus playing in them, I'd probs watch more of em
[0:37:48] <RaidenRising> baifus
[0:37:48] <%blitzrush1200> Pull for LeBron, top tier

[0:37:48] <scrublord009> LEBRON IS A TSUNDERE
[0:37:49] <%WhereIsWill> Fischl > Lebron
[0:37:51] <%SirGO0SE> EA should make sports games free and have waifu mode
[0:37:54] <+the_krypto_knight> EA sports games also just kinda suck. They lose features periodically
[0:37:55] <2DSuperiority> remember that NBA gambling trailer where it was all gambling?

[0:40:29] <%dekkitout> I phuckin wish 3+1 was 6 hours...
[0:40:30] <%blitzrush1200> 4 hour elevator scenes
[0:40:31] <bleugh> yeah 6 hour hand animated would be ridiculous
[0:40:32] <+Axle13j> Nice.
[0:40:33] <DatAsuna> Much like that fake thing about 16 games in shenmue, yet people never got the message that was a mistranslation too
[0:40:35] <thelonechris> That is a predicament
[0:40:36] <%AncelDeLambert> I see we've moved into the "Bully friend of channel" segment of DK's life. Welcome, DK, you are now The Woolie
[0:40:38] <phoenix7240> happy guda guda 5 day btw
[0:40:40] <1matheuw> thats called stupidity
[0:40:40] <fuji_92> @patstaresat next genshin update is in Nov 11, any thoughts about it?
[0:40:43] <Dragon_Batman> How'd it go Phoenix?
[0:40:45] <%Jrocy247> I would have LOVED if that movie was 6 hours
[0:40:51] <exack> @phoenix7240 Did you get anything good from the rolls?
[0:40:55] <MrPandastic> Isn't it both?
[0:40:56] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt is DK the new denizen of The Woolie Hole?

[0:41:02] <butthurtdave> Hey Pat, did you see that Transformers XCOM game coming out soon?
[0:41:03] <Daxalog> Atomicrops has runs and NO it is NOT tower defense your the only thing that shoots in that game
[0:41:06] <%AncelDeLambert> Does DK steal pies?
[0:41:06] <EASrake> It's both sorta
[0:41:07] <%SirGO0SE> i feel like @DukeMoose is my brother in animal fealty
[0:41:10] <phoenix7240> @Dragon_Batman got himeko and saito + the np5 nobukatsu
[0:41:11] <arielanarchy92> im loving the game and im playing free atm. Just pulled Fische and Chongyun! also got Noelle.
[0:41:12] <%dekkitout> @SirKeigan 1 is a redux of first 6 ish episodes, 2 is a shackup on the later episodes, 3 is a tragedy
[0:41:16] <+D00msDayDan> zangief's snoring sounds like paige moaning
[0:41:22] <%cylish> When did message highlights start costing 20k?
[0:41:33] <%SirKeigan> Yea, idk
[0:41:34] <%AzureGale> Yikes
[0:41:34] <%Vyskus> Vyskus subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! blaaaaaauauaguahauahahah
[0:41:36] <+deviljhojho_> tragic really
[0:41:37] <DianaTheAscian> thats dumb
[0:41:37] <phoenix7240> @cylish when chat abused it
[0:41:38] <DKDiamantes> oof...
[0:41:40] <%Typhaeon> Spending several money indeed
[0:41:41] <+Axle13j> lmao gottem
[0:41:41] <%DedlokPM> I thought Automacrops was one of those "create an assembly line" thing mogsShook
[0:41:42] <Shion963> oof
[0:41:42] <%afronooch> @cylish when pat told us to stop doing it
[0:41:42] <Solidnick18> i didn't spend any money for venti
[0:41:42] <+deviljhojho_> remember kids, dont do gacha
[0:41:42] <DatAsuna> I like venti but it's not worth that
[0:41:43] <exack> Rerolling after spending on an account NotLikeThis
[0:41:44] <+dave323dave> is venti even top tier?
[0:41:46] <%AquilaHarukaze> Preach
[0:41:47] <Dragon_Batman> Always expect not to get anything
[0:41:49] <%blitzrush1200> reroll or buy dont do both
[0:41:50] <suikudo> on my 20th account i got Venti and Qiqi
[0:41:51] <%BubbaRands> FOR 1
[0:41:52] <arielanarchy92> Jeez
[0:41:54] <Animorphimagi> thats how you go HOLLOW
[0:41:55] <+JavaManJoJo> that's very dumb to spend and then reroll
[0:41:55] <%maenos2> as a dolphin myself, I gotta say the few times i've spent money on gacha, the victory in the end has left me feeling quite hollow
[0:41:55] <Owkono> I got f2p Diluc yesterday
[0:41:55] <DatAsuna> Venti's pretty top tier
[0:41:57] <%Vyskus> an excellent rendition
[0:41:59] <%SirKeigan> People can abuse tagging Pat though
[0:42:00] <OkamiDude15> people who lack self control with gacha games scare me honestly
[0:42:02] <Shion963> got Diluc on my first roll, didn't even know he existed
[0:42:02] <Dragon_Batman> @phoenix7240 Good shit
[0:42:04] <BlkFlameKami> venti is the top or the tier
[0:42:05] <DianaTheAscian> if i can roll i roll
[0:42:05] <DatAsuna> Mostly because Venti can air lift himself on demand
[0:42:05] <+Greywyn00> anyone play FE:H? at least that game gives lots of free rolls
[0:42:08] <Psyramics> @DedlokPM so did I, buts that's cause you're misspelling it. its Atomicrops
[0:42:08] <+JohnRMo> when he says dk , he means diamond right
[0:42:09] <+Axle13j> Desire sensor is a bitch
[0:42:09] <3Xgilly> YEYEYEYEY
[0:42:09] <neVan0> i'm still rerolling myself :(
[0:42:10] <BrickleBork> PogChamp
[0:42:10] <%AzureGale> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[0:42:10] <Dreigun> I feel like luck is wasted on me. I rolled Venti f2p, and I don't use him except as a jump boost
[0:42:12] <+LowBatteryLife> NO
[0:42:12] <%SvenHolgersson> NO MORE BITS
[0:42:12] <+deviljhojho_> no :)

[0:52:25] <%skizzuto> I likely won't get into this game until they have a flavor of husbando other than twink
[0:52:25] <yirawk> You have higher chances for 5* characters like Diluc and Jean on limited rather than standard because of the 5* weapons

[0:58:07] <drewslo> downside us you are soaked while active so you take big elemental damage
[0:58:09] <%Jrocy247> @Jontman42 They're actually really not. Especially when there is SO MANY characters with unique movesets
[0:58:14] <+Vijuani> not a fan of these character designs tbh

[1:03:31] <fuji_92> Liyue is dope
[1:03:34] <+Promessa_EX> trips me out that liyue is like 4 km from mondstat
[1:03:35] <%Frost_Quill> I think you mean other taiwan??
[1:03:35] <+jgTone> anime china is fuckhuge
[1:03:40] <%Jrocy247> Man, Poor Amber, Literally the most USELESS character in the game.
[1:03:40] <+gustavozxd> they're usually pretty easy to kill
[1:03:41] <%President_Miyazaki> Fischl murders those things.
[1:03:42] <Dragon_Batman> Liyue has the better music too
[1:03:44] <%BubbaRands> I love how much work China put into CHINA
[1:03:44] <%SvenHolgersson> These enemies are fun
[1:03:45] <gaminji> emergency code attack? Kappa
[1:03:45] <+BringBackSempai> How many "Quick 50's" is Pat up to now
[1:03:45] <%Tornix> I just use fischl for these guys
[1:03:46] <+Harro8> @PatStaresAt Have you fought the wolf boss yet?
[1:03:46] <WorldFapRevealed> does Pat like game?
[1:03:48] <$RealThiele> Baeong Li
[1:03:48] <%dekkitout> They fold like cake to being frozen
[1:03:49] <Kongro_> Once you have Fischl upgraded, they're easy peasy
[1:03:50] <+Sp3ctre48> My one consolation for shit rolls is at least Razor and Fischl might as well be 5 star characters
[1:03:51] <%ashenfrenzy> Fischl can just destroy these things with a decent bow
[1:03:52] <DatAsuna> Liyue is way bigger than monstadt yeah
[1:03:53] <butthurtdave> I got stuck on some boss fight cuz it summoned all these water birds that combo attacked me and i couldnt hit them without a bow
[1:03:55] <%blitzrush1200> Time to meet more anime characters
[1:03:59] <%SvenHolgersson> Just bring two different elemental archers
[1:03:59] <Solidnick18> lighting plus fire works good
[1:04:00] <fuji_92> I mean if you use venti yeah they're annoying
[1:04:00] <%SvenHolgersson> Ez Pz
[1:04:00] <$RealThiele> monday is new banner
[1:04:01] <gryffinp> Fischl is pretty good against these guys cause you can lightning bow them to death... but she's level 1
[1:04:05] <stabbityrabbit> Eye of the Storms fucking suck. All my fun melee characters become unusable.
[1:04:06] <$RealThiele> or not banner but heroes
[1:04:09] <%BubbaRands> idol time
[1:04:09] <+D00msDayDan> the writing also super fellates liyue, they call mondstadt a godless nation while flaunting their wealth and prosperity
[1:04:14] <%Bailey__gaming> Barbra is my <3
[1:04:15] <drewslo> at least its not the water version
[1:04:24] <DatAsuna> Venti's biggest boon is that her can basically do a big jump anywhere
[1:04:25] <powerprotoman> these things are easy if you play as barbara
[1:04:25] <Psyramics> @butthurtdave yeah, same thing happened to me, except the only ranged I had was Barbara
[1:04:28] <%AquilaHarukaze> Mondstadt is only 1/3 of the map and 1/3 of Mondstadt is Stormterror's house...
[1:04:31] <CrazyMedicine> where's my waifu vergil?
[1:04:32] <$RealThiele> Barbara + razor for superconduct spam
[1:04:36] <%dekkitout> The shock cubes are the worst

[1:08:38] <stabbityrabbit> I mean, providing sustenance is the only thing she's good for. Paimon dumber than a bag of bricks.
[1:08:38] <1matheuw> it really do be like that
[1:08:40] <%heartlesshealer> Paimon is the name of a mythical figure usually depicted as a girl

[1:10:40] <Heatonist> gotta produce it
[1:10:41] <%SebsSpot> SebsSpot subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak!

[1:10:46] <fuji_92> ham, you make it
[1:10:47] <gryffinp> I didn't play BOTW but would you really call genshin's combat "tons better"? It's decently fun but it feels somewhat shallow.
[1:10:49] <+FutaSnek> REFINED HAM IS MY FAV
[1:10:49] <OblivionSword1> that's meat with salt i think
[1:10:49] <%walternatorz> refined rum ham
[1:10:49] <+NoirePanzer> paimon want HAM
[1:10:50] <Kongro_> There's a second tab when you cook
[1:10:50] <+gustavozxd> @boardscanada yeah I really doubt that would ever happen, they don't make games that would even "support" this kind of shit
[1:10:50] <Dragon_Batman> Or you can buy it at a store that has it
[1:10:52] <drewslo> ham meat plus salt
[1:10:52] <Shion963> guess who would know how to cook Liyue good food
[1:10:54] <silentblast93> thats meat
[1:10:55] <%DedlokPM> @PatStaresAt Processing (other tab in cooking menu)
[1:10:56] <zeif00> craft it at fire

[1:10:58] <%BubbaRands> ham is the other tab
[1:10:59] <fuji_92> REFINE MEAT INTO HAM
[1:11:00] <%BoxNavy> i mean the game tells you where to get everything
[1:11:01] <boardscanada> that 'dash' you can do is straight from Nier Automata too
[1:11:01] <happyfacespam> no ham like refined ham
[1:11:02] <%snow_bush> Refine your ham at a bonfire. You'll need sal.t
[1:11:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> can we assume the PS4 version of Genshin Impact will work on the PS5 or do you think they will just make a PS5 version?
[1:11:03] <dagorad> this game is better than botw imo
[1:11:04] <Shion963> Hamz you can buy that
[1:11:04] <Fro5tburn> EVERYTHING GOOD TAKES HAM I hate it
[1:11:07] <+D00msDayDan> check the stores in mondstadt for ham and ingredients
[1:11:08] <+zacyzacy> mini pat
[1:11:09] <%heartlesshealer> psaGiefrail
[1:11:09] <%OperatorJo_> refine the ham, baste the ham

[1:11:17] <deerlearning> junky botw clone
[1:11:17] <%BoxNavy> STOP
[1:11:18] <Kongro_> ugh hate the dog cheese
[1:11:18] <$joylent_blue> ew
[1:11:19] <$RealThiele> genshins combat is way better than botw, botw has more rewarding exploration imo
[1:11:19] <MasterTonberry23> im wating on resin to farm mats to ascend xingqiu, not because i like him but because i have no one better right now
[1:11:21] <+gustavozxd> for a second I thought he puked
[1:11:22] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> psaDogchamp
[1:11:24] <%SvenHolgersson> doge choese
[1:11:25] <+Promessa_EX> the game is only bland if you just mash with 1 hero
[1:11:26] <$joylent_blue> please never call it that ever again thanks
[1:11:26] <happyfacespam> DansGame
[1:11:27] <silentblast93> just like you with gout
[1:11:30] <+FutaSnek> Just gonna remove that thought from my mind
[1:11:30] <%DedlokPM> @silentblast93 fresh meat + salt
[1:11:31] <+ZoltanBMagnus> CHOESE
[1:11:40] <1matheuw> isnt xingqiu a girl?
[1:11:48] <$RealThiele> you cant mash in high level abyss thankfully
[1:11:48] <+Sp3ctre48> nope
[1:11:52] <+D00msDayDan> no
[1:11:52] <%DedlokPM> @1matheuw she is
[1:11:52] <CHVMPLOO> missed one
[1:11:53] <%OperatorJo_> no
[1:11:53] <%BubbaRands> Mouthfeel Kreygasm
[1:11:54] <Kongro_> No
[1:11:56] <boardscanada> fetch quests can turn tedious in these openworld games fast though
[1:11:59] <Kongro_> He's a young boy
[1:12:00] <Dragon_Batman> You can check under the book tab
[1:12:01] <fuji_92> missed one
[1:12:02] <Big_Dream> does anyway else see a blur on pays mini map on the bottom top left
[1:12:03] <happyfacespam> i feel like the parcels was worth more than that reward LUL
[1:12:05] <+dolphinbj> fucking with physics and the environment in BOTW is more fun than Genshin's combat IMO, but it's free so whatever
[1:12:08] <%BoxNavy> you are. not me.
[1:12:11] <Fro5tburn> D:
[1:12:12] <+Promessa_EX> yeah your gameplan falls apart if you dion't combo right
[1:12:13] <MasterTonberry23> xinqiu is absolutely a guy
[1:12:13] <1matheuw> nuh uh im not!
[1:12:15] <silentblast93> now to china?
[1:12:16] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Have you done Razor's quest yet?
[1:12:17] <+gustavozxd> LUL
[1:12:21] <Tomschiii> @RealThiele what for example? i dropped it because i was so bored of the open world
[1:12:22] <+D00msDayDan> @boardscanada not when the thing they're asking you to fetch is something you have dozens of already, then they're great
[1:12:26] <+FutaSnek> Its a shame the devs dont LUL
[1:12:29] <+dmtjinni> goblins
[1:12:29] <PeachJars> weeb
[1:12:32] <CptHarlok> @RealThiele Agreed. BotW's combat would be better if it weren't for every weapon being made out of glass apparently.
[1:12:33] <OkamiDude15> razor's quest is when he reaches 21
[1:12:33] <%BoxNavy> we have to go to china
[1:12:34] <+Pyroclase> Oh wow this border looks really good actually
[1:12:36] <%Jrocy247> For some reason, Genshin ALWAYS displays User ID for no reaon
[1:12:45] <nivlac_555> where are you in the story, still dong mondstat?
[1:12:45] <$RealThiele> glass and twig weaponry
[1:12:46] <+FutaSnek> ASSERTING DOMINACE
[1:12:46] <%heartlesshealer> it's kinda dumb that it needs to show your username in a singleplayer game
[1:12:47] <$joylent_blue> jerma-knee
[1:12:47] <%blitzrush1200> Check quests
[1:12:47] <Dragon_Batman> Check the quest tab?
[1:12:49] <MrPandastic> Yeah, for some reason the game shows your User ID CONSTANTLY. Its weird and dumb.
[1:12:50] <happyfacespam> you can access story quests by hitting J and navigating to them
[1:12:51] <%OperatorJo_> You have to run into that quest, literally
[1:12:52] <+Promessa_EX> very close neighbors
[1:12:52] <koffeemancer> It should be under the story tab in the quest menu @PatStaresAt
[1:12:53] <stabbityrabbit> I think it's funny that Razor is basically just Kevin from Trials of Mana.
[1:12:53] <Kongro_> but also russia
[1:12:54] <+Sp3ctre48> Makes sense
[1:12:54] <deerlearning> its ripoff botw
[1:12:57] <Gamer4ever7341> has pat delayed his attacks with Fischl yet to see the cringe?
[1:12:58] <%blitzrush1200> Wow c
[1:12:59] <Shion963> boy some people sure act like they haven't seen anime twinks
[1:12:59] <MasterTonberry23> i thought monstadt was france?
[1:13:01] <%dekkitout> There's two quests that bent me- 1 was Razor's the second was Chi of Guyun psaSkelmo
[1:13:01] <%BoxNavy> jerma's knee
[1:13:03] <drewslo> story progression
[1:13:03] <gryffinp> I've been posting screenshots with my user id uncensored and daring anyone who sees them to add me, no one has yet. Of course, I'm not pat, I don't have a fanbase.
[1:13:03] <+Greywyn00> I wonder what nation comes next
[1:13:04] <Potatoidea> Very good overlay
[1:13:05] <silentblast93> pat are we the one spinding hundreds of dollars in stupid gatcha games
[1:13:05] <%AquilaHarukaze> China is there and China is HUGE
[1:13:05] <$RealThiele> also japan and russia
[1:13:06] <happyfacespam> oh, controller, never mind LUL
[1:13:07] <ToneBacas> but where's Taiwan?
[1:13:08] <%Bailey__gaming> some quests you find by exploring
[1:13:10] <%Nekros4442> Mondstadt is more Gemrany than France
[1:13:10] <Dragon_Batman> Lupical
[1:13:12] <+Agentoracle> Taro root.
[1:13:13] <Shion963> lupical

[1:13:16] <FerwhateverDota> lupical i think
[1:13:17] <+Harro8> Lucipical
[1:13:18] <gryffinp> Oh that's another fun one

[1:13:24] <MasterTonberry23> @ToneBacas you mean china's island? Kappa
[1:13:25] <%BubbaRands> EngGerScottLand
[1:13:26] <Solidnick18> i was gonna do that today
[1:13:26] <+Sp3ctre48> Japan and Russia in the next few updates I think
[1:13:27] <didgereedoodah> you have to beat prologue first
[1:13:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt did you already order your replacement phone? there are Snapdragon 865 phones out there.
[1:13:29] <%BoxNavy> no

[1:13:40] <Zombrocom> This quest is actually pretty cool
[1:13:40] <+FutaSnek> @deerlearning I think thats a bit off, it takes a bit from botw but the combat is nothing like it and it has no puzzles rlly
[1:13:40] <$RealThiele> before the dinosaurs revolted
[1:13:46] <silentblast93> no
[1:13:46] <%BubbaRands> YES 4Head
[1:13:47] <+toastybites> China was colonized by Germany once
[1:13:49] <%Ynkubus_> Yeah, millions of years ago

[1:13:50] <Zombrocom> Boreas is cool

[1:15:44] <%blitzrush1200> Robbing Diluc while he's not there

[1:17:50] <$RealThiele> yes all characters have quests, some you gotta unlock
[1:17:53] <+Promessa_EX> Belt and Road initiative
[1:17:55] <gryffinp> @Kurt_0 I don't think so, I've gotten quests for waifus I don't have
[1:17:56] <Hasemeow> proof that pat cannot be a janitor
[1:18:04] <+gustavozxd> blindest
[1:18:04] <%Parapattern> Why is this quest just an opening to a porno?
[1:18:08] <+gustavozxd> blind janitor
[1:18:11] <%Rain_Mage> Yum
[1:18:11] <+lethallylactic> Pancakes PogChamp
[1:18:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can't miss a spot if you kill the person pointing the spot out
[1:18:14] <gryffinp> @Kurt_0 Or rather, the quests ARE linked to waifus but it doesn't seem that you need to HAVE the waifus
[1:18:14] <%BinaryFireball> pancakes are great
[1:18:16] <%SvenHolgersson> Its true
[1:18:20] <ergulor> Waffles are indeed better
[1:18:21] <%SvenHolgersson> Waffles are better
[1:18:23] <+Sp3ctre48> I hate borh
[1:18:23] <%Ranryu692> waffles suck
[1:18:24] <Heatonist> waffles have pockets to hold your syrup
[1:18:24] <%snow_bush> French Toast is Superior
[1:18:24] <Mr_Strut> Waffles are superior
[1:18:25] <+D00msDayDan> @Kurt_0 the opposite, the quests are to make you want the waifus
[1:18:26] <+ekodrop> she like's being pancaked

[1:30:25] <T_Sasquatch> Liyue feels like the real game they wanted to make
[1:30:26] <%stemlo_> stemlo_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! Pat, how do I ask people for Letters of Recommendation? I hate asking for stuff
[1:30:29] <OldManDeckardCain> now imagine getting all of the orbs there LUL
[1:30:31] <PleasedWorld> perhaps a bizarre one
[1:30:42] <%BubbaRands> All the money went to C H I N A
[1:30:43] <$RealThiele> Geonucleus LUL
[1:30:44] <Shion963> yeah it's three statues in
[1:30:46] <CappuccinoGuil> I just got all the statues yesterday, still need to unlock all teleports
[1:30:50] <gryffinp> but yeah it's a pretty decent sized map and if you imagine that they actually follow through and that total map size ends up being 2/7th of the game world, that'll be kinda nuts
[1:30:51] <Dragon_Batman> My favorite area is the stone jungle
[1:30:51] <%Broand> world quests are fantastic in liyue
[1:30:52] <%AquilaHarukaze> all fuckin 130 of them or something
[1:30:53] <PleasedWorld> he found the thing

[1:31:08] <FriendlyCheer> Wait you can see a trail to where they are? I always just climbed a mountain...
[1:31:15] <+D00msDayDan> finding all the oculus rifts without using an interactive map to track the ones you have and haven't gotten is hellish

[1:31:42] <%Aleate> Oh boy, the reading
[1:31:52] <OkamiDude15> kill the monstars with your chaos dunk child
[1:32:00] <%BubbaRands> THE MONSTARS

[1:32:06] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[1:32:08] <haisho> for real though he's the only guard in the whole marsh

[1:32:22] <%BoxNavy> cuttlery
[1:32:25] <gryffinp> Cookery?
[1:32:28] <%ashenfrenzy> if you cheat the exploration aspect of this game it would feel so empty imo
[1:32:29] <%DedlokPM> @PatStaresAt Good luck There are 130 of them
[1:32:30] <FriendlyCheer> And then you'll have 99/100 of em!

[1:33:22] <Shion963> Ningguang is also good. in general
[1:33:22] <+shabop> razor's claymore is good at breaking those shields
[1:33:27] <%FlakkLIVE> Use Razor he's got a claymore, that'll bust the geo shields
[1:33:31] <%Jrocy247> I like how the music changes for each region
[1:33:32] <%BoxNavy> give venti the bow that insta regens his RT sometimes

[1:45:29] <DianaTheAscian> Russia woo
[1:45:30] <+Axle13j> WutFace
[1:45:30] <Skeletonmanners> leaks say next one is japan
[1:45:30] <Kghaleon> The chinese city is amazingly huge tho
[1:45:32] <+natjen8> next is Japan
[1:45:32] <+vampireinarm> yeah but they made Germany like 1/4th the size of the China
[1:45:32] <PleasedWorld> when will they add the us of a
[1:45:33] <MrPandastic> Isn't it Japan?
[1:45:35] <Shion963> Japan
[1:45:36] <gryffinp> Leaks suggest that the next one is actually japan, weridly
[1:45:36] <@SoFarFetched> yeah think Plague was working on that vtuber for like awhile and showed progress.
[1:45:36] <fuji_92> Inazuma is japan
[1:45:36] <%AquilaHarukaze> Germany is the prologue I guess
[1:45:36] <%OperatorJo_> that squirrel EXPLODED
[1:45:36] <didgereedoodah> japan
[1:45:37] <%Jrocy247> When do we get the America level
[1:45:38] <%heartlesshealer> they want you to find china and be all "WOW, CHINA SO PRETTY"
[1:45:40] <+natjen8> russia is gonna be one of the last ones
[1:45:41] <$RealThiele> Inazuma
[1:45:46] <+Link232> Russia is the end-game I think 'cause the Fatui are the main antagonists so far
[1:45:47] <+natjen8> there is no America
[1:45:47] <+Promessa_EX> china in this game seems kind of authoritarian
[1:45:50] <%Jrocy247> LUL
[1:45:50] <+natjen8> USA sucks
[1:45:50] <+shabop> fantasy must take place in generic Europe. it is written.
[1:45:53] <+Deko_> LUL
[1:45:54] <SolGainer> Fire is gonna be South America
[1:45:55] <+lethallylactic> Japan isn't for a bit, but I think they're adding a smaller region at that ice mountain.
[1:45:55] <KitsuneManami> BURGERS!
[1:45:55] <$RealThiele> russia is coming out december
[1:45:56] <+Axle13j> lmaooo

[1:45:59] <OldManDeckardCain> gun FIRE
[1:45:59] <Dragon_Batman> Yea Russia is probably the snowy area
[1:46:00] <Sapphire_Breeze> Colonize the fire nation
[1:46:00] <3Xgilly> LUL
[1:46:00] <%AzureGale> Things all changed when the fire nation attacked
[1:46:01] <gryffinp> Mondstadt is kind of america though
[1:46:02] <%Aztec50> isnt that Monstadt?
[1:46:03] <3Xgilly> fitting
[1:46:03] <%BoxNavy> whens india
[1:46:04] <%afronooch> no america as it be
[1:46:05] <rekinom> Fire or Plague for us Americans
[1:46:05] <deerlearning> fire nation for firepower
[1:46:06] <powerprotoman> inazuma is japan and their electric
[1:46:06] <%heartlesshealer> hmmmmmmmm
[1:46:07] <+royalvermelon> They're gonna open up the mountain between china and germany
[1:46:07] <goblinpuppy> My favorite season, Green
[1:46:08] <dagorad> how about canada
[1:46:08] <KitsuneManami> Florida
[1:46:09] <DatAsuna> well before they add a new country they're just expanding the mountains between monstadt and liyue
[1:46:10] <+SwipperSwap> fire people are war people ithink
[1:46:11] <%Broand> I've heard references to russia having factories
[1:46:11] <MrPandastic> Well the US is currently on fire so it fits.
[1:46:11] <deerlearning> pew pew
[1:46:13] <+BloodyBurney> fire will probs be not-India
[1:46:13] <+D00msDayDan> there's a list of all the nations out there already
[1:46:14] <+lethallylactic> Mondstadt is Germany
[1:46:14] <Zayasu> it would be anime cowboys Kappa
[1:46:16] <%Parapattern> That seem more Britain
[1:46:17] <Shion963> or French?
[1:46:17] <fuji_92> next update is Nov 11 and don't look like we will get the next map just yet
[1:46:18] <%oniwahoo> We get to burn those peaceful Air monks alive!
[1:46:18] <%BoxNavy> monstadt is german
[1:46:20] <+Axle13j> all mobs have guns and only they can use 'em
[1:46:20] <MasterTonberry23> monstadt is germany/france
[1:46:21] <%Jrocy247> The American land needs to incredibly racist for the sake of Commentary
[1:46:21] <+Promessa_EX> mondstat is literally freedom town tho
[1:46:23] <DianaTheAscian> that would just be the west coast though
[1:46:25] <cumurasame> Everything changed when the Fire Nation Attacked! THE AMERICANS
[1:46:26] <EnderGamma> what do you think about updates to this game being roughly 1 and a half months apart?
[1:46:28] <KitsuneManami> @dagorad Canada is just Russia
[1:46:28] <PleasedWorld> honestly america as the country that's trying to dominate everything else in the map would be great
[1:46:33] <+vampireinarm> Whatever element America is automatically becomes the best element
[1:46:35] <ikantreeed> ...do u guys think we'll have a sliver a chance to see black ppl in this game...i already know the answer NotLikeThis

[1:46:42] <+Promessa_EX> ice is evil tho

[2:03:28] <%paladinstarbuster> saber doesn't use wind
[2:03:38] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt btw did u know Barbaras healing scales with her total HP?
[2:03:39] <KitsuneManami> Nooooooooo Barbera is STRONK

[2:03:44] <+Axle13j> saber does use wind magic actually lol
[2:03:44] <%Nekros4442> @paladinstarbuster ....yes she does
[2:03:45] <DatAsuna> Noelle also heals like that
[2:03:45] <%blitzrush1200> You need two healers for Abyss anyways
[2:03:46] <MrPandastic> She's a great offensive healer
[2:03:47] <$RealThiele> barbara :(
[2:03:47] <gryffinp> Needs more beams
[2:03:48] <KiryujiKazamoto> brain points exhausted

[2:04:03] <+lethallylactic> Probably don't need Barb AND Jean.
[2:04:03] <%Nekros4442> @paladinstarbuster like the first thing Saber shows is wind magic

[2:04:07] <+D00msDayDan> @paladinstarbuster found the secondary
[2:04:09] <OldManDeckardCain> pat's brain is fried LUL
[2:04:09] <stormhawk9891> Just put her on a new team
[2:04:11] <Blank9> all she wants is attack and she'll do damage and healing
[2:04:12] <fuji_92> barb is still the better healer tho, but if u want a healer who can do damage use Jean
[2:04:13] <OkamiDude15> the cogs are turning
[2:04:13] <Dragon_Batman> Go with what your heart says
[2:04:17] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt her healing isn't as good as Barbaras btw
[2:04:18] <gryffinp> Dump barbara in the trash and replace her with noelle
[2:04:19] <%BoxNavy> yeah ok

[2:04:29] <$RealThiele> lightning tho
[2:04:30] <KitsuneManami> Okay good Pat knows not to waste $ on Flat Stats
[2:04:34] <fuji_92> that could work
[2:04:40] <%BoxNavy> ray zore
[2:04:40] <Tomschiii> Qiqi is also damn fine as a healer dealer
[2:04:41] <%AzureGale> Do you prefer waifu or husbando
[2:04:42] <+DoomRedMage> Razor big blade
[2:04:42] <KiryujiKazamoto> @gryffinp Greatsword Maid Kreygasm
[2:04:43] <reonome> @gryffinp why would you replace trash with a dumpster
[2:04:44] <%Nekros4442> @paladinstarbuster She takes out her sword. Her sword is covered in?????
[2:04:46] <+ktothec99> Razor is my best character. I get doubels of him rather than any new characters lol
[2:04:46] <ミュウレ4242> awfully form fitting pants.
[2:04:48] <$RealThiele> @TheYharnamTheorem agreed, the book for barbara that incrases dmg on swap
[2:04:50] <%blitzrush1200> Just attack % substat with decent sets
[2:04:52] <DatAsuna> I would say just dump into the instructor set bonus for anemo chars
[2:04:52] <+Pilau32> Jean? Did this man spend more money? lol
[2:04:59] <SolGainer> Most of your ATK comes from your father BTW
[2:05:02] <SolGainer> *feather
[2:05:03] <OkamiDude15> yeah
[2:05:06] <Sapphire_Breeze> noooo Razor
[2:05:07] <haisho> but why
[2:05:09] <%AzureGale> Ray Zoor
[2:05:09] <%bevyrage> wait hold up, is the BERZERKERS BATTLE MASK the same mask as Dr. Doom???
[2:05:09] <KitsuneManami> WOO
[2:05:09] <%blitzrush1200> $140 more
[2:05:12] <KitsuneManami> Gotta go FAST
[2:05:12] <KiryujiKazamoto> i thought she was gonna say Ready for Eddy
[2:05:15] <+mMayrro> 2 healers LUL
[2:05:18] <+Harro8> Now you kill slower
[2:05:20] <fatcrab> @KitsuneManami Flat atk is good too right? You need flat atk for your % atk to scale it, so mix of both is best I think
[2:05:21] <+dr_zaius0> Oh man, look at all those dainty small people.
[2:05:21] <KitsuneManami> she has a MEAN Juggle lol
[2:05:22] <%paladinstarbuster> @nekros4442 its just camo
[2:05:23] <SolGainer> you also get Anemo Resonance cause of Venti
[2:05:24] <Dragon_Batman> It keeps them in the air for a few seconds
[2:05:25] <$RealThiele> $310 faster
[2:05:27] <%AzureGale> She got juggles
[2:05:29] <+lethallylactic> @PatStaresAt The charge attack actually causes enemies to levitate.
[2:05:30] <%Gogogolem> How do we make Dandelions cool
[2:05:30] <arkv01> glad pat is enjoying anime monhun
[2:05:32] <Blank9> best charge attack
[2:05:32] <T_Sasquatch> no one uses the main character LUL
[2:05:36] <+D00msDayDan> it's a big fat launcher
[2:05:38] <%JustinPM> Launcher but no aerial combat makes me sad...
[2:05:39] <%Gogogolem> I got this says genshin impcat
[2:05:40] <$RealThiele> yeet enemies into water to drown them
[2:05:40] <%BoxNavy> DIE
[2:05:41] <nauskills> Does this game have thick thighs?
[2:05:41] <RayCSmooth> Healer sisters
[2:05:41] <MrPandastic> Is it $310 cool though?
[2:05:43] <+MadPretty> @fatcrab You can get flat from your weapon and lvl though
[2:05:44] <+Promessa_EX> now if you had doubl;e fire and double wind...
[2:05:46] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat has forfeited his right to complain about Fate fans now that he's playing as Saber
[2:05:48] <%SvenHolgersson> Hit it from the back?
[2:05:50] <%SvenHolgersson> Nice
[2:05:53] <KiryujiKazamoto> Amber no good playable character but she has Bunbear
[2:05:53] <PleasedWorld> wouldn't we all
[2:05:53] <$TheYharnamTheorem> @RealThiele Bingo. Add some ice and you've got a stew going.
[2:05:53] <%Nekros4442> @paladinstarbuster The point was you said she didnt use Wind Magic. Her sword camo is literally called Invisible Wind
[2:05:54] <DianaTheAscian> u can shut it
[2:05:55] <KitsuneManami> @fatcrab yes but you get Flat ATT always from one of the Artifact slots. you do NOT want them in the sub stats
[2:05:56] <Siconia> Man if she launched forward in that move it'd be a dope stinger
[2:05:57] <nauskills> nvm
[2:06:00] <%blitzrush1200> PAt Why?
[2:06:02] <DatAsuna> @T_Sasquatch I use traveller partly for aetshetic and partly because they actually get to level constellation for free and scale huge on stats
[2:06:03] <KitsuneManami> Amber is ADORABLE, you SHUSH
[2:06:03] <KiryujiKazamoto> Bunbear makes all good
[2:06:08] <fuji_92> Amber is fine
[2:06:08] <$NoctisxMog> :(
[2:06:09] <%heartlesshealer> @nauskills so far no. Maybe other characters in the future will
[2:06:12] <Tomschiii> feel like i am the only one using travaler, because you get stuff for him with the story...
[2:06:12] <gryffinp> Amber has no idea

[2:10:45] <bashful_bard> Paimon is a witcher
[2:10:45] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[2:10:47] <%Rain_Mage> Paimon needs more drugs
[2:10:50] <nauskills> monkaS
[2:10:50] <1matheuw> @AFlyingTaco1 lets not get TOO crazy

[2:10:59] <RaidenRising> IS PAIMON GERALT ?
[2:10:59] <+lethallylactic> Pepe! FeelsGoodMan
[2:11:03] <powerprotoman> when was the last time you talked to a wolf pat?
[2:11:05] <ミュウレ4242> paimon is high in fat and preservatives.
[2:11:09] <DianaTheAscian> past
[2:11:10] <fuji_92> she's not wrong, you don't see them everyday
[2:11:10] <SolGainer> *past
[2:11:11] <PleasedWorld> paimon needs to be exiled from this land
[2:11:11] <+pectusumbra> ah, so that's why she's emergency food. she's an idiot
[2:11:12] <nauskills> Maybe they're mysterious in their universe
[2:11:12] <Gleil> my investigation on the wolf claw marks concludes that this attack was done by wolfs
[2:11:13] <dariusclover> paimon ace detective
[2:11:13] <%BubbaRands> Wolves are like the dogs of the forest 4Head
[2:11:16] <Dragon_Batman> Oh yea past boi

[2:11:27] <%kewlmyc> Dude is thrown 300 years into the future and is just cool with it after eating some food
[2:11:30] <%BoxNavy> youre both so fucking dumb
[2:11:31] <MisterAngryEyes112> paimon would be much better if she didn't refer to herself in 3rd person
[2:11:33] <PleasedWorld> because anime
[2:11:35] <brexdq> pat argues with a four year old
[2:11:36] <DatAsuna> traveller is such a dork
[2:11:36] <1matheuw> wolfie needs to drink his milkie
[2:11:37] <KidKaiser23> There’s time travel in this?
[2:11:41] <haisho> no calcium? Well, looks like we ain't getting one wolf for the skeleton war
[2:11:41] <fuji_92> LUL anyway
[2:11:53] <gryffinp> @MisterAngryEyes112 The really baffling thing is that that seems to be english dub exclusive
[2:11:55] <KiryujiKazamoto> @MisterAngryEyes112 she only doesn't once that i've seen. it actually threw me off
[2:11:56] <1matheuw> its anime of course it has time travel
[2:11:58] <+Sp3ctre48> No he got frozen by a plant and just lives in the future now
[2:12:00] <OkamiDude15> @MisterAngryEyes112 weirdly enough she only does that in english. she speaks normally in the other languages
[2:12:00] <DatAsuna> @KidKaiser23 nah he was just frozen captain america style
[2:12:01] <+D00msDayDan> @KidKaiser23 a guy got frozen in a cave for 300 years and you kinda just tell him to deal with it
[2:12:01] <%Broand> Nah it's quest related, he's from the past due to unfortunate circumstances
[2:12:03] <Zombrocom> I find it hilarious how your character basically genderbends every conservation
[2:12:03] <dariusclover> give the wolf some milk
[2:12:03] <Siconia> Paimon just sandbagging the shit out of your joke
[2:12:08] <Dragon_Batman> @KidKaiser23 More like a man being frozen for 300 years
[2:12:15] <%Arxel1> Arxel1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! Here's your montly gacha roll, I mean sub

[2:12:24] <1matheuw> space puppers
[2:12:25] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[2:12:26] <haisho> dammit Paimon
[2:12:27] <Gleil> my investigation on the wolf marks concludes that this attack was done by wolfs
[2:12:28] <+Deko_> LUL
[2:12:30] <+Sp3ctre48> I really enjoy how no one in the dub can produce Liyue the same way
[2:12:31] <KidKaiser23> Oh he did a Cap, gotcha
[2:12:32] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt Pat how does the impending inventory cap not drive u insane?

[2:13:01] <%GalacticaPhanto> DS3

[2:13:12] <1matheuw> hes a what?
[2:13:15] <PleasedWorld> so in the end this quest boils down to who let the wolves out
[2:13:17] <%DedlokPM> @prime_name part of the xiangling quest involes finding a cryologically preserved and a boar that went extinct. And Xiang's first instinct is to use the boar as the main ingredient in a cooking contest instead of trying to see if they could save it from extinction
[2:13:18] <%BubbaRands> Okayu?
[2:13:19] <%ssjklyco> Do sheep have pubes, and if so, how much of a wool sweater is pubic hair?
[2:13:21] <nauskills> Did Plague's Facebook Page got deleted?
[2:13:23] <@SoFarFetched> Plague made a Vtuber where he's a cat.

[2:15:24] <%BubbaRands> Plague went full furry
[2:15:28] <PleasedWorld> in the end its anime logic so it's best to not question it
[2:15:31] <$RealThiele> uncensor the asses
[2:15:38] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, why don't you have Noelle AKA the best healer?
[2:15:42] <KiryujiKazamoto> Plague is a Vtuber nyaow?
[2:15:46] <%heartlesshealer> Are all the beastfolk just Kemonomimi and not like, werewolves and anthropomorphic bears? >:

[2:17:00] <beatie_g> WUZ DAS SMELL
[2:17:02] <+Jaysky> Amber a cute.
[2:17:02] <AzureGale> Klee is Megumin
[2:17:03] <SolGainer> You can find out what lupical means by reading Razor's character profile
[2:17:04] <+dr_zaius0> "Looks to be from a gunshot wound."
[2:17:06] <$RealThiele> throws bombs, drops a bomcing bomb that eplodes into mines, and then blasts with options
[2:17:12] <$TheYharnamTheorem> Man, I like the combat, exploration, and grindy nature, but the character designs and voice acting are so abrasive daphHarold
[2:17:12] <+luftraumm1> anime was a mistake
[2:17:12] <PleasedWorld> just use noelle as a tank like it was meant to be
[2:17:13] <KiryujiKazamoto> Plague just hissed
[2:17:15] <+informedotaku> Tales of Genshin
[2:17:17] <1matheuw> thats so furry
[2:17:21] <gryffinp> it's a bastardization of a roman word but anyway
[2:17:22] <+Axle13j> that's rude paimon
[2:17:29] <Dragon_Batman> Barbatos Slim
[2:17:30] <DianaTheAscian> this quest is cooler at night
[2:17:38] <SolGainer> He ain't explaining SHIT
[2:17:38] <$RealThiele> food doesnt know manners
[2:17:43] <haisho> he WAS raised by wolves
[2:17:48] <+Ancopro> he dumb he's like i only know wolf god dog
[2:17:49] <gryffinp> So the character coming up soon has some real exciting japanese voice acting and I'm gonna be real disappointed if the english one lets me down
[2:17:49] <+lethallylactic> YA
[2:17:50] <CappuccinoGuil> @Axle13j Paimon? Rude?? Why, that's unheard of!
[2:17:50] <%Jrocy247> Paimon just straight up insulting someone's religion
[2:17:51] <%paladinstarbuster> Why are barbatos and Paimon named after demons?
[2:17:54] <DianaTheAscian> he doesn't know a lot
[2:17:56] <+luftraumm1> what the hell is this guy's hair doing? he has a hair hole on his hood
[2:18:00] <fuji_92> he is wolf Tarzan
[2:18:05] <SolGainer> There's a super mining spot close to the teleporter her btw
[2:18:15] <CappuccinoGuil> Jean is a healer?
[2:18:18] <%heartlesshealer> aoe constant heal is nice
[2:18:18] <%Gogogolem> also damage buff
[2:18:20] <+lethallylactic> @paladinstarbuster The Geo god is also named after a demon. They probably all are.
[2:18:21] <Dragon_Batman> Air swirls and burst heal
[2:18:23] <Aracon_> oh
[2:18:26] <+Axle13j> nailed it
[2:18:27] <Aracon_> that's pretty cool
[2:18:27] <Nobuwaroo> activision does damage too
[2:18:28] <SolGainer> she heals with her auto combo
[2:18:29] <haisho> also constant Anemo damage so you can constantly cause swirls
[2:18:33] <%FlakkLIVE> Hole her RT ability down
[2:18:38] <%oniwahoo> this game is really pretty
[2:18:39] <%FlakkLIVE> its the BEST
[2:18:43] <theanora1> seems like water is the healing element in this game
[2:18:43] <+mMayrro> who'd have thought this 5* is great 4Head
[2:18:47] <+lethallylactic> monkaS
[2:18:48] <+Deko_> is she 150$ great?
[2:18:49] <SolGainer> monkaS
[2:18:49] <+Harro8> Is it because of the skill or her tights?
[2:18:50] <+Sp3ctre48> big wolfy
[2:18:50] <mikesapartment> show jean armpit
[2:18:54] <%paladinstarbuster> @lethallylactic you think its foreshadowing?
[2:18:57] <fuji_92> no dmg buff, but if any enemy enter or exits the are they take a hit, and does dmg when u activate it
[2:18:57] <DianaTheAscian> pupper
[2:19:02] <%kewlmyc> BibleThump

[2:19:23] <%Divryne> THE BLACK WOLVES.

[2:19:45] <prime_name> Is that Tod Habercorn ?
[2:19:49] <Tomschiii> in the asian city the dogs run around with you and you cant pet them. i hate the devs for that. it hurts every time
[2:19:50] <%oniwahoo> @aydarkzero Started the stream with rolls
[2:19:50] <powerprotoman> this quest is the coolest
[2:19:51] <DianaTheAscian> @Aydarkzero yeah he got 2 5 stars

[2:19:56] <ikantreeed> aaaye i had my first win solo imposter
[2:19:58] <+mitzieter> barb and jean are healers
[2:19:59] <%kewlmyc> Heal DPS
[2:20:00] <+lupinelass120> Basically any since she's Anemo
[2:20:00] <EnderGamma> you'll eventually need 2 healers for 2 abyss teams
[2:20:00] <Gwyndellyn> Ah yes, I remember the wolf - human wars
[2:20:02] <%Gogogolem> shes damage support
[2:20:02] <bashful_bard> She's a dps healer
[2:20:03] <+Harro8> Shes an offensive healer
[2:20:04] <ミュウレ4242> not gonna skin and eat the wolf at least? rude to waste a dude's corpse.
[2:20:05] <haisho> she can be both
[2:20:05] <+lethallylactic> She's kind of everything
[2:20:09] <+Harro8> DPS Healer
[2:20:10] <KiryujiKazamoto> @scrublord009 when Kotal Khan is on screen everyone should asking "why is Kotal Khan dead yet"?
[2:20:10] <fuji_92> yeah, she's healer and dps
[2:20:10] <zeif00> deeps healer
[2:20:11] <Dragon_Batman> She is a great dps healer
[2:20:11] <+Sp3ctre48> Jean is an all rounder I think
[2:20:12] <%SvenHolgersson> She can be everything
[2:20:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> I think Barb's a better healer
[2:20:15] <+afroking1124> qiq also heals
[2:20:17] <KiryujiKazamoto> isn't*
[2:20:18] <%Jrocy247> Her, Diloc, Chuunni, and Ice Boy
[2:20:19] <Phoenon> It's fun using her skill to aim enemies up, send them to the sun LUL
[2:20:21] <%BubbaRands> yeet
[2:20:21] <theanora1> you need to team Fischl up with Xiangling
[2:20:22] <%oniwahoo> "Deeps Healer"
[2:20:27] <MrDelinquent> i used to get this game and Blue Protocol confused. Now i dont remember what BP is.
[2:20:27] <%Gogogolem> Drop Barbara
[2:20:29] <DianaTheAscian> jack of all trades master of none @PatStaresAt
[2:20:29] <fuji_92> so you can have 2 supports or a 3 dps
[2:20:29] <%Daniel_Is_I> It sucks that she's wind because Venti is too good
[2:20:33] <+mitzieter> barb gets ressurect at constellation 6
[2:20:33] <+Harro8> You need 2 teams for abyss so you can use barb anyways
[2:20:35] <powerprotoman> barb is a monster tho
[2:20:35] <+Jaromero435> Barbara best idol D:
[2:20:35] <+Sushi2k> absolutely throw barb out
[2:20:37] <Nobuwaroo> build her however you want, she very versatile
[2:20:44] <Dragon_Batman> For Jean you really just need fire and or elc so you get swirl damage
[2:20:44] <haisho> or put in Fischl for infinite Overloads
[2:20:44] <zeif00> drop barb for Fish for sure
[2:20:45] <Zombrocom> Replace barn with her better sister
[2:20:48] <%dekkitout> Min max her attack stat and have an ice with barb and a lightning of your choice
[2:20:48] <CappuccinoGuil> Like I said, 4 character slots is NOT enough
[2:20:49] <%heartlesshealer> at least 4 fire plillar
[2:20:49] <%paladinstarbuster> barbara does good wet damage
[2:20:50] <%Daniel_Is_I> Fischl is GREAT
[2:20:51] <+Missinglink91> How much has Pat spent on this game?
[2:20:53] <%blitzrush1200> Take out Barbra, if you want to keep jean
[2:20:55] <+Missinglink91> or has he been extremely lucky
[2:20:56] <%FlakkLIVE> Id say bring in Fischl for Barb
[2:20:59] <scrublord009> I think you need trascan amber for this
[2:21:00] <theanora1> I've gotten 2600 dmg hits with the Fischl & Xiangling team up
[2:21:00] <%kewlmyc> Probably the worst healer though, compared to Barb and Qiqi. Depends on what Constellation Barb is on. Still a good character though.
[2:21:01] <PleasedWorld> 310 bucks
[2:21:02] <fuji_92> barb is the BEST healer, but she's so best that she heals more than u need
[2:21:02] <%mitzieter> mitzieter subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:21:03] <KiryujiKazamoto> @paladinstarbuster huggGasm huggGasm
[2:21:04] <ミュウレ4242> and looks enough like saber that there's no lack of fanart.
[2:21:05] <haisho> oh you need Amber for this puzzle
[2:21:06] <%BoxNavy> fischl is really good yes
[2:21:06] <%heartlesshealer> left

[2:21:15] <%FlakkLIVE> @PatStaresAt do u have any fischl dupes? her dps build is a lot better with her first constellation
[2:21:17] <%Broand> canadollars*
[2:21:28] <haisho> they're timed too

[2:21:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 21m.
[2:21:37] <G03933> if only they made those glowing red statues easier to see
[2:21:42] <%blitzrush1200> $310 only 1 Fischl
[2:21:44] <DXLelouch24> Qiqi LITERALLY cant die due to her self sustain
[2:21:48] <powerprotoman> betetr start pulling for fish dupes then
[2:21:50] <%Broand> I have 4 fischl dupes
[2:21:53] <KiryujiKazamoto> Wolverine's been here :O
[2:21:53] <%paladinstarbuster> @KiryujiKazamoto yeah she does Kreygasm
[2:21:58] <%AzureGale> Ho ho ho
[2:21:58] <PleasedWorld> make the glowing red glow harder
[2:21:58] <%kewlmyc> Amber is always be useful for puzzles. More that what can be said about Lisa
[2:22:00] <+PrincessLuna85> you dont have any fischl dupes and i get 4 in a row
[2:22:01] <CappuccinoGuil> That's what he said indeed KappaPride
[2:22:03] <+PrincessLuna85> wish i got a venti

[2:22:21] <fuji_92> Noelle is tank healer, which makes her basically unkillable
[2:22:21] <CappuccinoGuil> God, the dialogue missing is so jarring lmao
[2:22:22] <%Parapattern> $310 dollerydoos?!

[2:22:40] <%AzureGale> THIS. IS. THE PAINKILLER
[2:22:42] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt btw theres a dungeon later in the game u can't complete unless u have amber on the team
[2:22:44] <%Gogogolem> Amber telling lies.
[2:22:44] <haisho> Amber can read?
[2:22:44] <%mitzieter> razor sounds way less lame in japanese
[2:22:46] <PleasedWorld> kill the big wolf since hes the shit
[2:22:53] <%Gogogolem> She knows cause she and paimon get high all the time
[2:23:00] <+lupinelass120> Gigabrain Amber with the third-grade reading level
[2:23:00] <%scrumbotime> Why do you read books? I DON'T KNOW?
[2:23:00] <gryffinp> amber is a good girl pat.
[2:23:02] <DianaTheAscian> the worst knight
[2:23:04] <PleasedWorld> the ability to read is relative
[2:23:04] <theanora1> Amber is pretty smart but also really stupid
[2:23:05] <+enigmaticgear> low tier zan read?
[2:23:06] <fuji_92> purple teacher is Lisa btw
[2:23:09] <OmniSTylez> jesus the talking but no lip flaps is throwing me off
[2:23:11] <silentblast93> save geif 2
[2:23:12] <%heartlesshealer> I like that they tried to make the ecology of the wolfhook seed make sense
[2:23:12] <%paladinstarbuster> is Amber Red Aqua?
[2:23:14] <%kewlmyc> No one's afraid of you Amber
[2:23:18] <%Jrocy247> Useless Knight
[2:23:20] <$RealThiele> at 70 im still stuck using amber for fire archery
[2:23:22] <+D00msDayDan> there's a puzzle tower in southwest liyur that's a gargantuan pain with any pyro character that's not amber
[2:23:23] <chancho4tierra> too low tier to read
[2:23:23] <haisho> yeah Amber is red Aqua
[2:23:35] <+notanofficer> so how is the breath of the wild mod so far?
[2:23:36] <gryffinp> Amber is way better than aqua
[2:23:40] <%Persona_EX> My balls are on the floor

[2:25:36] <Cecion> iframe check time
[2:25:38] <%dorthafiq> dorthafiq subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! How do you feel about the dialogue in this game compared to other jprgs? It's rare to get Chinese-style writing in a popular game, where a lot of conversations are more like philosophical rap battles rather than normalspeak
[2:25:39] <stevenellis386> how is it that the wolf speaks better than Razor
[2:25:39] <%heartlesshealer> umm
[2:25:40] <%BoxNavy> aight
[2:25:40] <%SvenHolgersson> BOSS DOG
[2:25:43] <scrublord009> HE FOR REAL
[2:25:43] <gryffinp> "Bare your claws of steel" is an amazing line for a wolf god to say to the human boy raised by wolves
[2:25:45] <DatAsuna> Immune is just because Anemo copies whatever element he has
[2:25:46] <+notanofficer> It would be cooler if had a sword
[2:25:49] <%SvenHolgersson> PAPA SIF IS HERE

[2:26:02] <KidKaiser23> Is it bad that I kinda want him to win...
[2:26:03] <GrandMazterNelson> use your i frames
[2:26:03] <DatAsuna> So anemo pops a secondary immune on most elementals, but you're still getting swirl in
[2:26:03] <%paladinstarbuster> Hes taking No samage

[2:27:21] <$RealThiele> water + ice dog

[2:27:39] <%BubbaRands> JUST USE RAZOR
[2:27:40] <Siconia> Also kinda looks like Suicune
[2:27:45] <gryffinp> @DatAsuna no that's really not how swirl works, you can use wind on fire-immune fire slimes and they'll stilll take wind damage, but they won't take bonus damage from swirl. But this wolf is IMMUNE to WIND.
[2:27:49] <%heartlesshealer> I wonder why
[2:27:51] <$RealThiele> BIG NUMBER

[2:31:42] <+Deko_> use fire and then wind?
[2:31:43] <%dekkitout> Or- team comp

[2:31:47] <%caramelatte1> Pat is screwed lol
[2:31:49] <%mitzieter> he's lvl 40 but he doesn't know the dodge button so it isn't fine
[2:31:51] <Dragon_Batman> Yea he should be ok overall
[2:31:51] <+Sp3ctre48> Swirl combos with his ice so he's immune to it
[2:31:53] <+DoomRedMage> Too much wind
[2:31:53] <haisho> yeah this isn't a great team
[2:31:54] <PleasedWorld> literally can only use xiangling to do damage, nice
[2:31:54] <$RealThiele> superconduct team

[2:32:00] <%AquilaHarukaze> remember your dash has i-frames get in there
[2:32:03] <+informedotaku> thid
[2:32:05] <+RisingFalls1> You can just climb out if you don't want to fight the boss again.
[2:32:15] <T_Sasquatch> The wolf is edge walking
[2:32:15] <%heartlesshealer> maybe use your wolf boy again
[2:32:17] <dagorad> ant damage LUL
[2:32:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I just saw an ad for this boss entering the stream
[2:32:19] <KiryujiKazamoto> how rude!
[2:32:19] <$RealThiele> yea dash i-frames were actually a lot more than i was expecting
[2:32:24] <KiryujiKazamoto> what is this, Full House?
[2:32:27] <NiktenKing> I wanna know how Razor gets through his identity crisis
[2:32:29] <+Seitine> He reminds me of Okami vaguely. Mostly cause of the beads and ‘wings’ on the paws.
[2:32:31] <%heartlesshealer> oh right you have barbara in
[2:32:32] <%heartlesshealer> damn
[2:32:38] <gryffinp> My experience with this boss has been that i-framing through his swipes works well, but i-framing through his aoes work poory
[2:32:39] <KiryujiKazamoto> "hao woode"
[2:32:40] <+ArtemisCroc> this is a terrible party for this boss lol
[2:32:45] <fuji_92> I'm not sure u can do with this party, at this level... LUL u need razor or gish
[2:32:50] <fuji_92> *fish
[2:32:55] <$RealThiele> you can leave and come back with no penalty
[2:32:56] <MrPandastic> Yeah her skill isn't great. Her burst is rad though.

[2:33:16] <%Typhaeon> Oh boy is it "run around the arena ineffectively" time
[2:33:17] <fuji_92> SourPls
[2:33:17] <+Jaysky> Watch as Pat does it with this party and he tells chat to sit down
[2:33:20] <+ArtemisCroc> @fuji_92 this fight is easy underlevelled though, you just need anything that isn't wind
[2:33:21] <arkv01> jade parcels or almond tofu
[2:33:25] <Admiral_PopnFresh> the combat in this game doesn't seem too bad
[2:33:25] <CrazyMedicine> the burning effect is also gacha
[2:33:26] <Shion963> boy that's a big Dark Souls
[2:33:28] <$RealThiele> the add phase will be neat to see
[2:33:31] <%BoxNavy> good trade
[2:33:31] <$Dakuu75> that cs earlier was confusing. "You're not a wolf, fuck you. But... if you ever wanna train, i'm down with that."
[2:33:34] <DatAsuna> put fichl or lisa in if you wanna explode him
[2:33:38] <nibble_nuts> LUL

[2:34:23] <%kewlmyc> Oh yeah, doesn't help that you're using a wind user

[2:35:59] <+Deko_> crazy talk\
[2:36:00] <Phoenon> This dude's attacks get HORRIBLE to deal with if you can't burst him down fast enough
[2:36:01] <%g0atmeal> g0atmeal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Why does everyone like the avalanche gang from FF7? They're completely flat
[2:36:01] <gryffinp> Pat cleared the Prologue (wind zone) story but hasn't begun Chapter 1
[2:36:03] <$RealThiele> Wind's Howling.
[2:36:05] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Kappa
[2:36:05] <brexdq> crazy talk
[2:36:06] <DianaTheAscian> very nice
[2:36:07] <RavenHellkite> Kreygasm
[2:36:07] <ミュウレ4242> gotta get strong waifus, then name them the flip-mode squad.

[2:36:09] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[2:36:10] <SolGainer> Kreygasm
[2:36:11] <%AzureGale> butt
[2:36:12] <arkv01> oh does he not get to use story quest razor cause he owns razor?
[2:36:12] <MarvelousSlacker> its a fair reason to like jean
[2:36:12] <+TheSaintJohn> because of the plot
[2:36:13] <%Typhaeon> Saberface bait
[2:36:14] <dagorad> Kreygasm
[2:36:14] <+afroking1124> jean cafeGasm
[2:36:14] <OkamiDude15> its also why they like barbs
[2:36:15] <bustawof> yes
[2:36:16] <Phoenon> Yeah Jean's got that mothership LUL
[2:36:18] <haisho> yeah pretty much
[2:36:19] <%Ranryu692> Jean has convinced me to try this game

[2:36:20] <%barrakuta371> veiGasm veiGasm veiGasm
[2:36:23] <zeif00> CAKE
[2:36:23] <chancho4tierra> yes
[2:36:27] <SolGainer> There are many butts in tights in this game
[2:36:29] <DKDiamantes> The answer is always Ningguang
[2:36:30] <+D00msDayDan> the real reason people like jean is her idle animation
[2:36:32] <$RealThiele> whiff
[2:36:39] <AzureGale> Also why they like Keqing
[2:36:42] <%kewlmyc> It's why people like Mona too
[2:36:44] <arkv01> this games butts and thighs speak to me
[2:36:46] <+Jaysky> People like Jean because of her good genes
[2:36:47] <$RealThiele> Ning crystallize makes her so tanky
[2:36:50] <OkamiDude15> @DKDiamantes my man

[2:37:12] <+RisingFalls1> Yup
[2:37:12] <%TheWinged7> dashed against the wrocks
[2:37:12] <+Pyroclase> people die when they are killed
[2:37:13] <KidKaiser23> Steal their cabbage and do em dirty in front of their squad!

[2:37:55] <NiktenKing> almost ded
[2:37:56] <TheNumberJay42> barb is only needed in dungeons really
[2:37:56] <+RisingFalls1> Put a Tales of the Dragon Slayer on Barbara and use her to boost your main DPS's damage.
[2:37:56] <autumnsfall> nice fall damage lmao
[2:37:57] <+Sp3ctre48> literally almost died
[2:37:57] <%kewlmyc> fall damage is a thing Pat
[2:37:57] <Laveyrin> better stack energy recharge on Jean then
[2:37:59] <didgereedoodah> you want 2 wind though?

[2:38:03] <$RealThiele> LUL
[2:38:04] <%AzureGale> YOU FELL
[2:38:04] <DianaTheAscian> fall damage
[2:38:05] <%heartlesshealer> you fell
[2:38:05] <RayCSmooth> fall damage
[2:38:05] <reonome> fall
[2:38:05] <+egalitarian696969> fell
[2:38:06] <DKDiamantes> Fall damage from the cliff fall
[2:38:06] <OkamiDude15> fall damage
[2:38:06] <MrPandastic> Broke Jean's legs
[2:38:07] <Siconia> Fall damage
[2:38:07] <+afroking1124> fall dmg
[2:38:07] <NiktenKing> you fell 22 ft
[2:38:07] <LilacsandFreedom> you fell
[2:38:07] <%BoxNavy> hmm... when...
[2:38:07] <%BubbaRands> b-but that's Jean's sister....You'd break up sisters?!
[2:38:07] <Gutsandlove> fall damage
[2:38:08] <+ArtemisCroc> fall damage lol
[2:38:09] <%blitzrush1200> Yeah Barbra is more for Abyss and really tough boss fights
[2:38:10] <Dragon_Batman> You ran out of stamina and fell
[2:38:10] <PleasedWorld> yes
[2:38:11] <koffeemancer> Fall damage?
[2:38:11] <1matheuw> broke your legs
[2:38:12] <TheNumberJay42> LUL fall damage
[2:38:12] <%BoxNavy> good job pat
[2:38:15] <$RealThiele> R2 with barb and swap back to jean
[2:38:15] <Aracon_> fell
[2:38:16] <fuji_92> fall dmg
[2:38:18] <%BubbaRands> you big fell
[2:38:22] <+D00msDayDan> the high heels must be a gigantic damage multiplier for fall damage
[2:38:22] <+Jaysky> Go away Barbra... Goooo... cirPls
[2:38:25] <CappuccinoGuil> Don't you have no fall damage when you air attack?
[2:38:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Venti is Sunk-Cost Fallacy. Use him because he cost 140 bucks
[2:38:29] <Phoenon> If you plunge attack while falling it cuts down on fall damage SUPER hard
[2:38:34] <Zayasu> is kaeya bad?
[2:38:39] <+D00msDayDan> @CappuccinoGuil can't air attack when you're out of stamina
[2:38:39] <%Nekros4442> No, they were immune to the fire dmg
[2:38:42] <NiktenKing> No they are immune to pyro swirl
[2:38:44] <KidKaiser23> Fall damage? I thought this shit was big anime??
[2:38:44] <$Dakuu75> I got so HARD and tried so FAR but, in the end it didn't even matter~
[2:38:48] <+afroking1124> yes
[2:38:49] <$RealThiele> Venti is amazing on Abyss and domains where timers cause issue
[2:38:52] <haisho> yeah that
[2:38:52] <gryffinp> Right, you still get the wind
[2:38:54] <Shion963> Swirl just spreads
[2:38:55] <autumnsfall> Yes, swirl fire. They're pyro slimes after all.
[2:39:02] <Phoenon> Try aiming up when holding down her RT, you can send them into the sun LUL
[2:39:05] <DatAsuna> electro is so good for combat, I never go without one
[2:39:07] <gryffinp> wind would be pretty shit if it was incapable of dealing damage to any enemy that was immune to the element it was made of
[2:39:11] <mr_slaide> Not enough waifus on Pat's team.
[2:39:11] <MrPandastic> God you suck Pallad
[2:39:13] <dagorad> va PogChamp
[2:39:16] <+Jaysky> That male NPC looked like the Monster Hunter 4 guild woman
[2:39:18] <+smevvster> @ShinobiPhoenix How are those sour grapes, dude
[2:39:18] <haisho> Swirl is honestly terrible for enemies with innate elements
[2:39:19] <DevinMayCry> Winds really good when theres multiple elements especially lightning and fire or ice
[2:39:20] <%FlakkLIVE> @Zayasu He isn't anything to write home about but if he's your only ice unit he'll suffice. Just use him mainly for applying his frost debuff
[2:39:32] <%AzureGale> But Pat's team is ALL waifus
[2:39:35] <$RealThiele> backing down like a hero
[2:39:51] <mr_slaide> Venti is best grill.
[2:39:52] <+RanekMDH> If you don't use Beidou, its not a real hero
[2:39:57] <+Jaysky> Razor is top waifu
[2:39:58] <+RanekMDH> real team*
[2:39:58] <haisho> Electro is king of the meta right now
[2:39:59] <CHVMPLOO> thats a good team
[2:40:01] <+ShinBojangles> one of them is a husbando
[2:40:02] <+Harro8> thats a good team
[2:40:06] <SolGainer> nah use Jean instead of Barb
[2:40:07] <%blitzrush1200> Squad team
[2:40:07] <$Dakuu75> @AzureGale this whole game is waifus, even the guys are waifus
[2:40:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ShinobiPhoenix wasn't my 140 bucks, I'm not even starting this game until i get my PS5
[2:40:13] <theanora1> you don't need both Razor and Fischl on a team
[2:40:13] <+Link232> That's a decent team yea
[2:40:15] <Phoenon> That's a standard bustedass team since electro + pyro is insane
[2:40:15] <fuji_92> that's solid
[2:40:19] <+Jaysky> That's a good wisdom
[2:40:22] <Dragon_Batman> Yup
[2:40:22] <SolGainer> There are artifacts you get later that make Anemo busted
[2:40:26] <%FlakkLIVE> pulled Beidou today and that perfect parry slash is SO fun
[2:40:28] <$RealThiele> yea double lightning seems overkill
[2:40:29] <SolGainer> gotta farm for em tho
[2:40:30] <reonome> Kreygasm
[2:40:30] <RavenHellkite> good ass Kreygasm

[2:40:41] <+TopTierHarley> Pat confirms likes Saber
[2:40:42] <bashful_bard> Heals just scale off her atk power too so she's just ace
[2:40:43] <Siconia> Her ass is mediocre, Noelle has the best ass
[2:40:43] <fuji_92> yup good ass Kreygasm

[2:40:52] <Phoenon> She really gets into those screams
[2:40:55] <+Jaysky> Saber ass is always OP
[2:40:55] <%Typhaeon> She needs to have her body slider adjusted downwards a bit
[2:40:57] <%r0chelimit> This woman is a stick y’all are nuts
[2:40:58] <DevinMayCry> -2
[2:40:59] <DKDiamantes> Double elements are fine for the Elemental Resonance

[2:42:23] <+Jaysky> Japan absolutely likes butts, but they prefer tiddies.
[2:42:24] <%AquilaHarukaze> So many effects it tanked the framerate for a second
[2:42:26] <%blitzrush1200> Venti has the fuck it button
[2:42:26] <+ShinBojangles> butt flutter will be DLC jaboodyTroll

[2:43:14] <@commanderclaw> She said never because you're impotent
[2:43:14] <haisho> actually with Jean and Venti he'll be generating lots of Anemo
[2:43:17] <stevenellis386> deez nuts

[2:43:39] <%heartlesshealer> done did it
[2:43:47] <%heartlesshealer> OH NO TEXTURES
[2:43:53] <KidKaiser23> Pat is such a fly guy, he really did it to em
[2:43:54] <malletman241> holy shit, Pat's still streaming after nearly 3 hours!?
[2:43:57] <+Jaysky> That guy is still in the chat he didn't leave
[2:44:00] <fuji_92> I heard it
[2:44:01] <haisho> farm Mora
[2:44:02] <reonome> pat do the batman quest
[2:44:09] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt btw the china battle theme is great
[2:44:09] <Dragon_Batman> Did you never click on them then?
[2:44:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> @echobee_tv He has fiber
[2:44:15] <+Jaysky> @malletman241 You're jinxing it
[2:44:18] <TheNumberJay42> does ping even affect this game?
[2:44:19] <1matheuw> psaWInk
[2:44:23] <%BoxNavy> yes
[2:44:25] <Dragon_Batman> It's ok your only human
[2:44:25] <+Sp3ctre48> Lots of quests in the 2nd area are like that and it sucks
[2:44:28] <mr_slaide> Fatman forever.
[2:44:33] <Shion963> not in solo
[2:44:33] <+afroking1124> it does
[2:44:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> The Batman quest sucks
[2:44:35] <$RealThiele> ping affects this game yea, bigtime in co-op
[2:44:35] <1matheuw> psaWink
[2:44:37] <+DoomRedMage> Only in coop
[2:44:37] <%Regigangster> Hey, I might be stupid
[2:44:39] <fuji_92> Pat do the Sparta quest later
[2:44:39] <+Sp3ctre48> haha Imagine having good internet BibleThump
[2:44:44] <MarvelousSlacker> only for coop, otherwise it doesnt do anything
[2:44:46] <fuji_92> *sparda
[2:44:47] <+afroking1124> yes in solo
[2:44:50] <gryffinp> I'm not convinced by this two wind team comp
[2:44:58] <%TheWinged7> It definately does, as someone from Aus i literaly cant play it
[2:45:00] <T_Sasquatch> im kinda confused, isnt venti , barbatos
[2:45:01] <$RealThiele> ameno too anemic
[2:45:03] <nellysian> look at her run in those high heels man
[2:45:10] <%TheWinged7> 250 ping is the lowest i can get in aus
[2:45:11] <chancho4tierra> fuck me shes great
[2:45:16] <haisho> two wind comp is mostly for map traversal really
[2:45:19] <%BoxNavy> yeah but the sunk cost tho
[2:45:20] <theanora1> Venti's doing real low damage with his bow
[2:45:22] <%SvenHolgersson> At least it's not Geo
[2:45:23] <NiktenKing> better for exploring cause stamina reduction
[2:45:23] <+echobee_tv> @rumtumtugnutz On gigabit fibre and it's still 80ms :( believe it's due to the server distance.
[2:45:26] <gryffinp> Yeah this quest is weird ike that
[2:45:26] <mikesapartment> venti updraft unto downslam is a good combo
[2:45:27] <+Sp3ctre48> Doesn't necessarily matter when Jean and Venti are both busted individually
[2:45:35] <MarvelousSlacker> I get 160 and It never feels like ping is a factor
[2:45:35] <gryffinp> it forgets to replace the normal enemy squad until you get close enough
[2:45:38] <%koolaid_kevster> @patstaresat did you know venti is actually barbatos that jean is calling out to
[2:45:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> Bet you could one that would fill that void deep inside....With gambling
[2:45:41] <$RealThiele> Venti to me never deals big damage, hes damage/CC
[2:45:44] <+Promessa_EX> pat's gear is bad
[2:45:47] <Dragon_Batman> A blonde knight and her coffee destroy everything they see
[2:45:54] <+smevvster> Well Jean isn't really "busted", Venti's Q is just a deathblender.
[2:45:56] <Siconia> As someone else from Australia, my ping sits at roughly 316 and it plays fine for me
[2:46:00] <Blank9> jean is actually barbara's older sister
[2:46:00] <ferropenic> ping doesn't matter in solo I'm also australian and getting 250+ ping
[2:46:03] <%Regigangster> D: He's what!
[2:46:07] <RCIRainer> Against Boreas double Anemo ain’t shit, but it’s great for exploring when you have other characters with sprint stamina passives
[2:46:08] <%BoxNavy> thats cute
[2:46:10] <mr_slaide> So fabulous.
[2:46:11] <CappuccinoGuil> BRUH
[2:46:16] <Dragon_Batman> Also the statue in Mondstat is just him
[2:46:17] <1matheuw> so venti is a god?
[2:46:19] <CappuccinoGuil> Venti can just make upstreams???
[2:46:21] <%Monkeyweed21> Did you unlock the femboy Rattatouile yet @PatStaresAt ?
[2:46:21] <+Pyroclase> Also if anyone here plays Warframe, there's an alert up for Umbral Forma for liek 15 more hours.
[2:46:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> @echobee_tv But that wouln't track cause if you're in Western canada you're closer to the servers in China than pat is
[2:46:23] <Shion963> he's Barbatos the wind god
[2:46:25] <+Sp3ctre48> yes
[2:46:25] <Dragon_Batman> Same braids and everythin
[2:46:28] <mr_slaide> Venti is best girl.
[2:46:31] <DevinMayCry> Yeah hes got a revalis gfale
[2:46:34] <CappuccinoGuil> @1matheuw yes, and god is wearing tiny shorts and thigh highs
[2:46:34] <+Ancopro> so wait how old is he
[2:46:38] <+ShinBojangles> Ew its that weird macross delta antennae crap
[2:46:39] <haisho> Not gonna lie, Double Wind with Amber means gliding for DAYS
[2:46:40] <sirowlsnest> This looks like a weird BotW clone
[2:46:41] <$RealThiele> wind god got bored and gave up
[2:46:43] <+StrawberryPantsu> THAT'S JUST RREVALI'S GALE!
[2:46:45] <mr_slaide> totally 18.
[2:46:45] <Nobuwaroo> yea the characters are good but imo the bonus from two wind units is mostly for traversal and not damage
[2:46:46] <DianaTheAscian> venti is a very weak god
[2:46:46] <+Sp3ctre48> If I was gonna double up on elements I would just do Electro
[2:46:50] <+God_Of_Oreos> @CappuccinoGuil God is real PogChamp
[2:46:50] <%BoxNavy> jermaOld
[2:46:50] <haisho> but that means having Amber in the team
[2:46:52] <T_Sasquatch> boy (girl)
[2:46:52] <NiktenKing> Venti is just a human with a mcguffin
[2:46:52] <fuji_92> like 5000 years or something
[2:46:53] <DianaTheAscian> but still a god
[2:46:53] <+notanofficer> So do you start the game at lvl 40 of has he been playing for a while?
[2:46:53] <+StrawberryPantsu> Old enough
[2:46:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> Like 800
[2:46:55] <+Ancopro> well WELL
[2:47:00] <%BubbaRands> god old
[2:47:01] <+TopTierHarley> double fire is strong too
[2:47:05] <TheNumberJay42> old enough Kappa
[2:47:05] <%BoxNavy> hes old enough to drink
[2:47:07] <%UvBenServed> Seems legit
[2:47:07] <1matheuw> @CappuccinoGuil alright how do i sign up for this religion?
[2:47:08] <+PrincessLuna85> @PatStaresAt do you know of any way to get the lightning ore without using fire? its kinda inconvenient when i dont have a fire person on my team
[2:47:09] <Zombrocom> Actually yes
[2:47:11] <%BubbaRands> you can lewd
[2:47:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> He's the youngest of the gods!
[2:47:12] <+smevvster> Less than 3700 - Geo Archon is that old, and he's supposed to be the oldest.
[2:47:13] <$RealThiele> well all the gods here seem more like the traditional Immortal Sages
[2:47:13] <+ShinBojangles> Ok but how old does he LOOK?
[2:47:15] <+echobee_tv> @rumtumtugnutz Once you're in the game you get to choose the server you're closest to, in our case it's the US one.
[2:47:18] <i_am_therydon> sooooo legal?
[2:47:20] <Dragon_Batman> @notanofficer He has been playin a good bit
[2:47:20] <+D00msDayDan> no he's 3000 years old german myth god, the 3000 years old chinese myth dragon comes later
[2:47:23] <%BoxNavy> da huff man
[2:47:27] <mr_slaide> Totally legal.
[2:47:28] <%goose_attack_almanac> How Game?
[2:47:29] <+Sp3ctre48> But Paaat this is the western area BabyRage
[2:47:31] <%Divryne> Venti make the pee pee hard.
[2:47:32] <T_Sasquatch> the explanation for Gods in this game is so dumb and convuluted
[2:47:33] <$RealThiele> Myth dragon is <3
[2:47:34] <DevinMayCry> Hes legal but you arenmt for him
[2:47:36] <CappuccinoGuil> @notanofficer you can level up characters with items. Cap starts at 20 and increases at specific Adventure Rank milestones.
[2:47:37] <+Sp3ctre48> game good
[2:47:38] <%BubbaRands> Venti drinks too so...legal
[2:47:49] <+ShinBojangles> Nice tilt there
[2:47:58] <%goose_attack_almanac> Paimon is the name of a Djinn right?

[2:53:57] <mar_krow> Batman
[2:54:18] <OkamiDude15> kaeya is diluc's adopted brother so do with that what you will
[2:54:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> Kayea and Batman have a more complicated relationship than that.
[2:54:19] <maskedmook> I just spent primogems to restore resin on accident and I am sad
[2:54:24] <+Sp3ctre48> Kaeya is also Diluc's brother Keepo
[2:54:28] <gryffinp> I think they give a name for the absent Grand Master at one point
[2:54:33] <+Sp3ctre48> All your ships are bad chat
[2:54:35] <gryffinp> and also that he's out on some quest

[2:56:30] <RavenHellkite> yeah spend it on me instead give me 3000$
[2:56:30] <gryffinp> The crazy thing is how few rolls per money you get, like it it was one dollar per roll I could kinda see it but when it's 20-30 for 10 I'm like man what.
[2:56:33] <+Pookiedaexzile> Its like real Gambling but with no upside

[2:57:00] <gryffinp> I do not believe for a second that whoever sent in that money believes a single word he wrote.
[2:57:02] <1matheuw> what about 4k tho?

[3:13:26] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Are you remembering to keep up your Ratatouille buff?
[3:13:29] <NiktenKing> the only one hand swordswoman better than Jean is Keqing
[3:13:31] <+Taisuru> Duffman
[3:13:34] <+Sp3ctre48> No the knights suck
[3:13:36] <+Jaysky> Man how come Paimon doesn't curse like a real good sidekick?
[3:13:37] <alephalpha> wow they reallya r eincompetent
[3:13:38] <+Mushinronja> shouldn't they have a door
[3:13:39] <+lethallylactic> Thanks Guy :)
[3:13:40] <%Divryne> ONE GUY?!?!?!
[3:13:42] <$Caped_Eggy> He was taking a shit
[3:13:43] <%Aleate> "Some Guy should watch the gate"
[3:13:44] <stevenellis386> THATS WHAT IM SAYING
[3:13:45] <%BoxNavy> paimon is just a creature
[3:13:47] <%BubbaRands> guy fieri
[3:13:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> Why is the gate just wide open?
[3:13:49] <mr_slaide> Knights and guards are always useless.
[3:13:56] <MisterAngryEyes112> SOME GUY SHOULD WATCH THE GATE LUL
[3:13:57] <Zombrocom> At one point a character refers to paimon as an "elf" so I figure it's a known thing somehow
[3:13:59] <+Akabane101> Is this flavour town?
[3:14:03] <haisho> the only competent ones we've seen so far were Jean and Kaeya
[3:14:06] <DevinMayCry> Cause this nations all about freedom man
[3:14:08] <MisterAngryEyes112> Awfully prescient of Pat
[3:14:12] <ikantreeed> @PatStaresAt Can u only pronounce Jean name the french way to annoy ppl?
[3:14:16] <%BubbaRands> DIE HUFFMAN
[3:14:25] <alephalpha> I unno those two silver knight arcehers we're deifntielyw orth their weight in gold
[3:14:25] <haisho> bring in the Fischl, feel POWER
[3:14:26] <+Taisuru> Double wind?
[3:14:28] <+trentongator> So why is this game terrible and shitty?
[3:14:28] <+Sp3ctre48> My boy PogChamp
[3:14:29] <DianaTheAscian> NOOO
[3:14:29] <+ShazBo2000> Ahhhh ahhhh ahhhh
[3:14:31] <stevenellis386> someone should watch the gate lol
[3:14:33] <%MisterRockett> Diluc is unfortunate cause he's the "gritty cop/vigilante I don't play by anyone's rules" type which people are becoming more critical of and it's only kinda okay here cause he fights monsters but even still they're still semi intelligent?
[3:14:37] <G03933> for a guy that took so long to get to the gate, he sure did get to the castle fast
[3:14:41] <suikudo> +
[3:14:44] <%BoxNavy> shes cute
[3:14:45] <thatsocrunchy> Huffman Kappa
[3:14:45] <%Jrocy247> Like, Are people familiar with Paimon, they just NEVER question who she is at all.
[3:14:45] <%oniwahoo> Lotta anime voices going on in this game
[3:14:46] <1matheuw> shes hot
[3:14:48] <+Taisuru> RAZOR Kreygasm

[3:14:53] <%BubbaRands> she idol
[3:14:54] <gryffinp> barbra is a decent healer so she's memed to the top
[3:14:54] <%Daniel_Is_I> Barbara is a really good healer and water's not a bad element.
[3:14:57] <+D00msDayDan> glide with barbara for your answer
[3:14:57] <ikantreeed> BUFFMAN
[3:14:58] <%Monkeyweed21> She's a 10/10 healer

[3:17:31] <arkv01> nooope
[3:17:32] <+Akabane101> So what is the expected amount of Canadian $ someone would drop on this game for a reasonably enjoyable experience?
[3:17:35] <arkv01> rough times bud
[3:17:35] <%BoxNavy> you can check by sets
[3:17:35] <Slim_Lipid> You keep passing it LUL
[3:17:36] <MisterAngryEyes112> but I truly doubt Pat is going to even get that far because resin is cancer
[3:17:36] <DatAsuna> Just hit RB to find your shit by set
[3:17:37] <+HelloImTom08> check with sets
[3:17:39] <%WSintai> Hit the RB mah bro

[3:18:12] <+reemasbaid> Gene

[3:18:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> Wolf boy is best girl.
[3:18:18] <+Sp3ctre48> There's supposed to be lots of QoL stuff in the next update so hopefully they fix resin
[3:18:20] <DatAsuna> give jean the p90
[3:18:26] <%DedlokPM> @NopeBadguy yes
[3:18:30] <RainShott> ^ ? LUL
[3:18:31] <thatsocrunchy> Y’all probably know this already, but mf doom’s masks is literally in this game
[3:18:31] <gryffinp> I put martial artist's stuff on my wind mc
[3:18:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> I hope they fix controller in 1.1
[3:18:36] <CappuccinoGuil> I put all Def and HP on Noelle. She's unkillable
[3:18:39] <%BoxNavy> good
[3:18:40] <+Pookiedaexzile> You can tell this Wolfboy is wild beause his shirt isn't all the way tucked in
[3:18:41] <DatAsuna> I would love i they added a mark as favourite or lock option
[3:18:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> Welcome to anime character design
[3:18:55] <Dragon_Batman> Put at least 2 for Martial artist I say
[3:18:58] <haisho> yeah 2 piece on Martial Artist is great
[3:19:08] <%AzureGale> Dat bulge
[3:19:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> His shirt is a tablecloth and a bandage
[3:19:11] <DatAsuna> I basically have to level up anything I'm remote interesting in up to at least level 2 so i don't acicdentally use it as material
[3:19:14] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat the set bonus is 15% more damage
[3:19:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> in other news we've made this one character have actual lips, that means she is a slut
[3:19:24] <DatAsuna> You can get 2 and that's fine
[3:19:26] <NiktenKing> ???
[3:19:28] <%goatbait> does anyone else hate how the confirm sound during dialogue sounds like the discord notification sound?
[3:19:30] <%BoxNavy> ...
[3:19:31] <leonegaming6> 😳 unless
[3:19:32] <Dragon_Batman> Resolution of Sojournerer

[3:19:37] <Siconia> Resolution of Sojourner
[3:19:44] <RazYamiyo> Those kids were fast as lightning
[3:19:47] <Kain5707> Pat..
[3:19:53] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, select the Sojourner in the set.
[3:19:53] <DatAsuna> There are also certain headgear pieces that give a 1 piece bonus, so those are perfect to combine with sets
[3:19:56] <%BoxNavy> ohhhhh
[3:20:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> he doesn't have a shirt to be tucked!
[3:20:02] <CappuccinoGuil> Like that
[3:20:04] <+Sp3ctre48> I'm proud of you Pat
[3:20:09] <Dragon_Batman> 2 martial artist and 2 resolution
[3:20:11] <arkv01> yeah use the set tab
[3:20:15] <%BubbaRands> he learned!
[3:20:15] <RazYamiyo> nyannPat nyannPat nyannPat nyannPat nyannPat

[3:20:22] <%BoxNavy> youre doing great pat
[3:20:31] <%Monkeyweed21> 2 martial artist hourglass @PatStaresAt
[3:20:32] <+reemasbaid> is there a blur in the top left somewhere??
[3:20:34] <%AzureGale> But characters in Uncharted also do untucked shirts
[3:20:39] <+Sp3ctre48> I use lots of exile gear for the energy recharge
[3:20:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> You see as a monk, He has to wear a hood with no sleeves
[3:20:52] <RazYamiyo> nyannAngry
[3:20:53] <backpackpackback> Pat I gotta go. Thanks for the fun
[3:20:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> @reemasbaid Yes
[3:20:55] <Dragon_Batman> Yea love you any way LUL
[3:20:56] <Kain5707> yup
[3:20:56] <Siconia> We know this
[3:20:57] <+mMayrro> why would you lose it?
[3:21:03] <%Jrocy247> Yes you are
[3:21:06] <haisho> YES
[3:21:09] <Dragon_Batman> You can yea
[3:21:13] <NiktenKing> No go for greatsword
[3:21:15] <haisho> not the Martial Artist
[3:21:15] <Blank9> jean wants ALL ATTACK
[3:21:15] <%Monkeyweed21> Jean is Berserker
[3:21:16] <%Zulrez> no, razor will you be your damage dealer
[3:21:16] <%BubbaRands> yep
[3:21:17] <Laveyrin> Jean wants Energy recharge
[3:21:19] <haisho> Sojourner yes
[3:21:21] <Siconia> Depends who you want as a dps
[3:21:23] <Phoenon> You got 9 Soujourners so maybe you still can
[3:21:25] <+reemasbaid> @rumtumtugnutz lol do we know why??
[3:21:29] <+WhoolieFox> you have 9 pieces of the set why not put 2 on both
[3:21:35] <+Harro8> Razor is a better main dps
[3:21:38] <NiktenKing> razor does hybrid damage and has burst more often
[3:21:38] <DXLelouch24> FOCUS on 2 characters at a time or you WILL hit a bottleneck in resources
[3:21:38] <Kain5707> Pat you will get a shit ton of artifacts dont worry
[3:21:39] <%Monkeyweed21> its really not
[3:21:40] <haisho> Chevalier is practically the upgrade to Martial Artist
[3:21:44] <+xeros720> you guys teaching patto to genshin gooder?
[3:21:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> @reemasbaid It's to hide Pat's UID
[3:21:46] <%BoxNavy> oh no the gobolins
[3:21:52] <%Monkeyweed21> you're just dumb
[3:21:54] <+Pookiedaexzile> @AzureGale Uncharted is anime as hell, down to the picking the boring blonde girl over the cooler dark haired friend
[3:22:02] <+reemasbaid> oh neat
[3:22:04] <+xeros720> (just stack atk%)
[3:22:24] <+Pookiedaexzile> No MonkeyWeed, We are dumb as hell together
[3:22:30] <Phoenon> 4 piece Zerker is kind of trash, can swap that out
[3:22:36] <haisho> yeah you didn't give her a good set
[3:22:36] <Dragon_Batman> I think the crit helps for auto attack heals but switch it
[3:22:42] <DXLelouch24> just focus on Attk % until endgame where you can farm 5 star artifacts
[3:22:46] <Kain5707> 2 sets each
[3:22:50] <+brave_sj> God damn it Pat's got Jean and all I can roll is fucking Xianglong
[3:22:54] <+Harro8> her healing scales with attack
[3:23:00] <%Monkeyweed21> PAt why are you forgetting things you already know?
[3:23:01] <%SwdVengeance> Elemental mastery isn't bad on Jean, it boosts her elemental combo damage when she spreads element effects
[3:23:12] <+xeros720> he was brave and rolled the general banner
[3:23:13] <+xeros720> be brave
[3:23:16] <%BoxNavy> no...

[3:23:30] <DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt I BIG recommend giving Barbara the exile 4 piece bonus
[3:23:36] <arkv01> elemental mastery and reactions is really powerful at this point of the game
[3:23:49] <+Sp3ctre48> Only 5 star I got was Mona but at least she's busted apparently FeelsBadMan
[3:24:01] <%BoxNavy> thats basically free attack up
[3:24:05] <%Jrocy247> Man I wanna roll for Jean so bad
[3:24:09] <+xeros720> if you go to the attributes menu, you can see all the atk% added together
[3:24:11] <+Akabane101> The biggest
[3:24:13] <Kain5707> Geno PogChamp
[3:24:15] <DatAsuna> My lisa has 200 elemental mastery and it's insane
[3:24:16] <%BoxNavy> pat burn those flowers

[3:24:19] <hairtoday> geno?
[3:24:21] <%afronooch> dmgo
[3:24:28] <CrypticMochi> Feathers give a pretty big atk once you upgrade them
[3:24:28] <NiktenKing> Man Jean is so much slower than Keqing
[3:24:30] <Dragon_Batman> Rando question, I'm hoping to someday get Beidou, which banner might be the better option?
[3:24:46] <arkv01> keke? the guy who does cool animations on twitter ofc

[3:25:17] <+xmc_ryuuji> did he do more pulls like when he got venti?
[3:25:17] <%AzureGale> Keqing is best girl
[3:25:18] <OkamiDude15> ka chow
[3:25:18] <DatAsuna> Event banner weights it in favor of 4 specific chars
[3:25:19] <+Taisuru> HE'S INVINCIBLE

[3:25:22] <+D00msDayDan> @ShazBo2000 no that's qiqi

[3:25:22] <MisterAngryEyes112> @ShazBo2000 no that's qiqi

[3:33:18] <gryffinp> Oddly I was JUST looking at star trek memes in my other window
[3:33:18] <@SoFarFetched> cause he ewas having trouble with his stream today.
[3:33:19] <%oniwahoo> Star Trek is that series about the half robot guy who hates sand, iirc
[3:33:19] <iheatthis12> watch lower deack
[3:33:22] <%BoxNavy> i gotta watch TNg
[3:33:25] <fuji_92> Pat is explicitly not using diluc so he doesn't want to pull him I see
[3:33:25] <mr_slaide> Plague is being an ass about it.
[3:33:31] <mr_slaide> Lower decks sucks.

[3:33:42] <%SirGO0SE> you guys still using the VR? Bridge Crew <3
[3:33:46] <gryffinp> @oniwahoo no dude star trek is the one about the aliens who pretend to be gods and have a black slave race
[3:33:53] <Owkono> Plague is now a cat
[3:33:54] <$Dakuu75> he's a lovable ass, though.
[3:33:57] <%Ranryu692> You really should watch more. I'm almost finished DS9, it's so good
[3:33:59] <%BoxNavy> he should just move out of the countryside 4Head
[3:34:00] <Dragon_Batman> Aww

[3:34:05] <+Superbro64> @thetruthofyourbeing you REALLY like starbucks huh?
[3:34:08] <%SirGO0SE> that makes sense
[3:34:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> Razor is voiced by Todd Haberkorn.
[3:34:15] <mr_slaide> Plague is busy drawing furry stuff.
[3:34:16] <RazYamiyo> Can we call him cat man? PridePog
[3:34:19] <+Sp3ctre48> I should rewatch DS9
[3:34:23] <Phoenon> It's been one'a those days when you don't wanna wake up, everything is fucked, everybody sucks
[3:34:26] <+Dogbert24> did pat enter whale mode or did he get super lucky with 5 stars
[3:34:29] <gryffinp> Are we allowed to derail the chat into talking about how good ds9 is

[3:36:03] <Siconia> Did that fucko just quote Mary Poppins
[3:36:08] <mr_slaide> Yes.
[3:36:12] <@SoFarFetched> Plague would live not in the same house,cause he wants his privacy. But Paige would always come out and knock on his door to ask if he can come out and play LUL

[3:36:26] <scarman125> he know's he can use Diluc for this mission right
[3:36:28] <Shion963> Did you know that Crystallize gives you elemental shields?
[3:36:39] <%Monkeyweed21> use Diluc
[3:36:41] <+Dogbert24> earth is decent against shields too
[3:36:43] <%BoxNavy> i think the mage is more of a problem
[3:36:47] <%toastybites> why is he not using Diluc
[3:36:57] <Shion963> Diluc's RT can chain 3 times
[3:36:59] <Siconia> LUL
[3:36:59] <%weissguard> LUL
[3:37:00] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[3:37:02] <Siconia> Forced
[3:37:03] <+LynbellDaYo> lol
[3:37:07] <+Pookiedaexzile> Oooooh
[3:37:08] <%BoxNavy> yeah theyre fucking annoying
[3:37:10] <%Ranryu692> When I started DS9, I thought there was no way I would end up liking it more than TNG. I was wrong
[3:37:10] <gordieda20> LUL
[3:37:11] <%toastybites> big blind
[3:37:12] <Dragon_Batman> I think he just didn't want to use Diluc is all
[3:37:12] <DianaTheAscian> Pat its water
[3:37:13] <MasterTonberry23> did you know dihydrogen monoxide is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and lethal if inhaled?
[3:37:15] <haisho> No lie, Razor is actually better in this case
[3:37:16] <+Sp3ctre48> Geo combos feel very underwhelming compared to the others rn
[3:37:18] <+Pookiedaexzile> "Its So big"
[3:37:24] <Shion963> Diluc's such a cool character
[3:37:27] <maskedmook> water mages are the worst enemy
[3:37:31] <%BoxNavy> geo characters are so boring
[3:37:33] <scarman125> yea Geo sucks
[3:37:38] <gryffinp> So the problem is that Pat was told by both the chat and the game itself that his shiny new 5*s venti and jean are really good, and they are, so he's getting through it, but he's definitely not abusing the element stuff as much as he should be because he's just swapping between two wind users, an element that is best when it's comboing with others.
[3:37:40] <%Jrocy247> These Enemies fucking suck. I really hate them and that Barrier shit.
[3:37:44] <%kewlmyc> Shock to break shields
[3:37:47] <Shion963> dude Crystallise basically nullifies enemy effects
[3:37:48] <NiktenKing> We need Dendro
[3:38:08] <+xeros720> i'm afraid jean's bubble butt is terminal
[3:38:14] <%BubbaRands> Jean got too much bubble Kappa
[3:38:15] <fuji_92> Pat if you're not gonna throw you don't need to hold Jean's special, just press it
[3:38:16] <Siconia> Time for torture?
[3:38:22] <%BoxNavy> geo could be the most busted shit on earth its boring to play so to hell with it
[3:38:25] <%Aleate> Burn him
[3:38:26] <%BubbaRands> TORTURE
[3:38:29] <mr_slaide> Take him to Detroit.
[3:38:34] <Siconia> YO TORTURE
[3:38:36] <fuji_92> torture? torture
[3:38:38] <%Monkeyweed21> WHERE IS SHE?
[3:38:38] <gryffinp> They didn't have the balls to animate Diluc going full Mustang v. Envy on this guy.
[3:38:40] <%AFlyingTaco1> That guy's face is too smooth for him to have a voice that deep
[3:38:41] <gordieda20> WHERE IS SHE?
[3:38:42] <+D00msDayDan> oh man the english abyss mage voice is way better than the japanese
[3:38:43] <+Sp3ctre48> I like the voices for these things
[3:38:44] <%BoxNavy> GET FUCKED
[3:38:44] <Dragon_Batman> The hold is for control
[3:38:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> Talking alot of shit for someone in a dizzy state
[3:38:45] <Zooperton> D:
[3:38:47] <+Jaysky> IT BUUURNS
[3:38:52] <+SinisterBroccoli> Long range vs short range
[3:38:53] <fuji_92> you keep holding to aim, you don't need it unless you're gonna aim
[3:38:55] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Holding it doesn't increase damage, it just lets you aim their launch angle. If you want damage just tap.
[3:38:55] <%rdark_ksu> yay torture!
[3:38:58] <%BoxNavy> :) die
[3:39:01] <zeif00> They gave you a trial Diluc for this dungeon LUL
[3:39:02] <%toastybites> again!
[3:39:03] <DianaTheAscian> BURN MORE
[3:39:03] <%AncelDeLambert> THE PAIIIIIIIIN!
[3:39:04] <%Aleate> Burn
[3:39:04] <TheNumberJay42> BURN HIM
[3:39:04] <DXLelouch24> BURN HIM AGAIN
[3:39:04] <%ssjklyco> again
[3:39:04] <Siconia> Chinese Gacha game supports torture
[3:39:06] <%BubbaRands> BURN HIM AGAIN
[3:39:06] <%Vyskus> this got dark lmao
[3:39:09] <%BoxNavy> no keep burning him
[3:39:09] <NiktenKing> DIE DIE DIE
[3:39:09] <%Zeroblazex> It means it doesn’t increase the damage with holding
[3:39:09] <+Axle13j> give 'im one more LUL
[3:39:10] <DatAsuna> I like Ninguan's geo a lot
[3:39:13] <gordieda20> BURN
[3:39:13] <%BubbaRands> KEEP BURNING
[3:39:13] <iheatthis12> Does this game have any weirdos or is everyone just anime people?
[3:39:14] <fuji_92> BURN HIM
[3:39:17] <haisho> holding doesn't do anything until you hit Constellation 1 on Jean
[3:39:18] <Dragon_Batman> Holding is mostly useful for just getting enemies in a bunch
[3:39:19] <%Zeroblazex> Unless you wanna mitigate and throw
[3:39:20] <%Broand> Torture works everyone
[3:39:24] <%BoxNavy> well look at them
[3:39:24] <DatAsuna> Noelle's geo is also cool and she's a weird tank/healer hybrid
[3:39:28] <%AncelDeLambert> the fucker got a Gom Jabbar at his neck, wtf?
[3:39:30] <fuji_92> I love how silly it is
[3:39:31] <%Samurai_Mak> They sound normal in Japanese
[3:39:32] <%Daniel_Is_I> This audio modulation isn't present on the JP voice
[3:39:34] <+SinisterBroccoli> we put up with how you talk Pat
[3:39:35] <stormhawk9891> Oddly fitting though
[3:39:35] <mortalmanbaby> bet it sounds better in japanese
[3:39:35] <NiktenKing> he is an imp so it basically fits
[3:39:38] <mikesapartment> im so glad this alien world uses AM and PM
[3:39:41] <+Superbro64> This guy needs a losenge DansGame
[3:39:42] <Dragon_Batman> @iheatthis12 Depends on what you mean by weirdo
[3:39:43] <gryffinp> There's like ONE of these abyss mage guys in ONE side quest who has a smooth baritone with no distortion and it's weird
[3:39:46] <+Pookiedaexzile> Do it again
[3:39:47] <+Dogbert24> they need to hire more intimidating villainous henchmen
[3:39:58] <%BoxNavy> dont worry about that
[3:40:07] <%Foopoof> diluc's too cool to lip sync
[3:40:08] <%DedlokPM> @Daniel_Is_I there is some modulation, but not as noticable has english
[3:40:11] <%AFlyingTaco1> Jean, honey, I'm gonna have to ask you to calm those thighs down.
[3:40:15] <+Superbro64> Entire game is lip synced to the chinese va track @patstaresat
[3:40:16] <%Vyskus> lip syncing, who needs it
[3:40:24] <+Superbro64> but you probably already knew that
[3:40:30] <%Zeroblazex> For a water mage to hype up those flames man they really want you to see how cool Diluc is
[3:40:31] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> how's the PS4 version?
[3:40:34] <fuji_92> Chinese lipsync tho
[3:40:40] <+Jaysky> She's into it
[3:40:41] <haisho> all I see on the Genshin Impact reddit are Jean's ass and Emergency Food
[3:40:47] <+Sp3ctre48> PS4 version runs like shit
[3:40:47] <thetruthofyourbeing> she simping
[3:40:48] <%BoxNavy> @BLK_HRLQN_13 garbo i hear
[3:40:51] <Dragon_Batman> Ps4 version is ok, doesn't run as well as pc though
[3:40:58] <+xeros720> probably Paimon's smartest moment
[3:40:59] <BrickleBork> Master Diluc PogChamp
[3:41:00] <+SinisterBroccoli> playing this while you're playing and listening to an echo while paimon is talking NotLikeThis
[3:41:00] <Siconia> That's a long list for Paimon
[3:41:00] <%Monkeyweed21> she doesn't want to be toasted rations
[3:41:01] <+Sp3ctre48> And I'm trapped on it, pls help
[3:41:04] <mr_slaide> Just eat Paimon.
[3:41:05] <fuji_92> she just saw u torture a dude diluc, i wonder why
[3:41:05] <OkamiDude15> @BLK_HRLQN_13 heard it doesnt run that great when compared to the other versions
[3:41:07] <%DedlokPM> @BLK_HRLQN_13 has some performance problems but otherwise good. but no cross save
[3:41:12] <%Vyskus> abyss mages aren't people, just like paimon
[3:41:14] <+Superbro64> @haisho your missing a WHOLE LOT of people being pissed on how bare bones late game is
[3:41:17] <RavenHellkite> doesn't run as well as phones either LUL
[3:41:18] <+Superbro64> Im impressed
[3:41:24] <+Jaysky> Do not eat the Paimon
[3:41:24] <Dragon_Batman> Your good
[3:41:25] <%Daniel_Is_I> !uptime
[3:41:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 41m.

[3:41:29] <%ssjklyco> 3 hours
[3:41:33] <mortalmanbaby> i just started watching T.T
[3:41:34] <@SoFarFetched> wow pat
[3:41:34] <$Afterman_> LOL
[3:41:35] <@SoFarFetched> your email
[3:41:36] <NiktenKing> Don't eat Paimon
[3:41:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Would roasted Paimon be like toast or marshmallows?
[3:41:41] <+D00msDayDan> time flies when you're burning money
[3:41:42] <%DedlokPM> EAT DA PAIMON rooH
[3:41:46] <fuji_92> LUL
[3:41:47] <@SoFarFetched> it was just Pat------sat
[3:41:50] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:41:50] <%SirGO0SE> was good stream :)
[3:41:51] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:41:51] <%Regigangster> I feel like... we wont see this game again chat lol
[3:41:53] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> that's a shame, good thing my laptop can run this pretty good... hopefully
[3:41:55] <+Jaysky> Do NOT eat the Paimon
[3:41:58] <SaphronBlackbourne> patsat
[3:41:58] <%Ranryu692> luckily it's also completely obvious xD
[3:42:00] <+ShazBo2000> LMAO
[3:42:00] <s_snowball> i wonder what could be those middle letters LUL
[3:42:02] <fuji_92> paimon is food, not friend... remember chat
[3:42:03] <RedTako> LUL pat crazy talks at
[3:42:06] <ygtidal> goodnight
[3:42:06] <Kain5707> patsat@gmail
[3:42:07] <RavenHellkite> going back to being patmon
[3:42:08] <%DedlokPM> DO EAT DA PAIMON rooH
[3:42:10] <gryffinp> people who get mad at online games's "endgame" for not supporting their 10 hours a day habit with "enough content" after they burn through all of the main content as hard as they can are silly and should be disregarded.
[3:42:12] <@PeachSaliva> I’d like to buy a vowel
[3:42:13] <@SoFarFetched> Throw us at eli's stream he LOVES company Kappa
[3:42:24] <+Jaysky> @BLK_HRLQN_13 If it can run on mobile so it should be alright
[3:42:26] <haisho> only one tip: Overload all the things
[3:42:28] <NiktenKing> ANDRIUSs theme is so fucking good
[3:42:32] <+Jaysky> *I'd think it should
[3:42:33] <@SoFarFetched> Am I a Vowel or are U a vowel Kappa
[3:42:35] <%BoxNavy> hi paige
[3:42:47] <NiktenKing> but not as good as the Liyue battle tracks
[3:42:51] <Dragon_Batman> That would be 200 funbucks
[3:42:53] <+Sp3ctre48> Lots of people plowed through the content and the next major area update doesn't seem to be till December so it's gonna feel pretty bare lategame for a while
[3:42:54] <ChungusQuest> Ooh, Plague's playing DS1
[3:42:55] <+Superbro64> @gryffinp You'd be impressed at the sheer amount of gacha crazies that already tore through the content tho
[3:42:56] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:43:02] <%ssjklyco> More like "Are you buying son?"
[3:43:06] <@SoFarFetched> it helps pat poop
[3:43:10] <@SoFarFetched> loosens it
[3:43:10] <%Aleate> So time to raid Plague so we can ask him when Star Trek is right? tfuKEK
[3:43:14] <%BoxNavy> thanks
[3:43:15] <%heartlesshealer> didn't plague's stream end?
[3:43:15] <Dragon_Batman> Ribbed for her pleasure
[3:43:18] <%Monkeyweed21> Paige doesn't have a butthole
[3:43:18] <%ssjklyco> Plug it on stream
[3:43:20] <gryffinp> @Superbro64 Oh man I'm in an FGO discord, I know how crazy the gacha crazies get and I argue with them daily
[3:43:26] <ChungusQuest> @Aleate precisely!
[3:43:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Dog toys are all just dildos.
[3:43:28] <%aslfrasle> That can't be a butt plug, where's the flared base!?
[3:43:30] <Shion963> +10 for Chili Resistance
[3:43:36] <+Superbro64> @gryffinp sounds like a loosing battle
[3:43:36] <%AFlyingTaco1> Kongs are for chewing, not butt plugging
[3:43:39] <%Jrocy247> A lot of people don't seem to understand, these Rolls are purely luck based. There is no Tactics.
[3:43:39] <%Ranryu692> aw yeah, we're getting more basketball, folks
[3:43:42] <%Monkeyweed21> Pumpkin Jack is Medievil but good
[3:43:44] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah plague ended already cause it's playing a vtuber LUL
[3:43:46] <icemochablunt> are you playing genshin ironically
[3:43:47] <EASrake> That is correct
[3:43:50] <+xeros720> yeah, teachers and shit hear that all the time
[3:43:50] <%ssjklyco> Everything is a buttplug if youre horny enough.
[3:43:53] <NiktenKing> I will only spend at most 60 dollars unless they have more content that seems worth it on the same level as other live service games.
[3:43:56] <+xeros720> it's not weird
[3:43:57] <%AncelDeLambert> a lawyer of recommendation?
[3:44:01] <%SirGO0SE> and then they feel good about you trusting them with that :)
[3:44:02] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, eat the mic
[3:44:04] <fuji_92> I need for a thing
[3:44:05] <+Sp3ctre48> Unless the teacher or whoever hates you they'll usually say yes, I promise it's not that bad
[3:44:07] <+FierceDeityGabe> And then they say who are you
[3:44:08] <%BoxNavy> no :)
[3:44:08] <notkojima> LMAO this stream is for "mature" audiences
[3:44:11] <%YakumoYomi> @Monkeyweed21 Agreed, even though I like Medievil
[3:44:12] <Siconia> And then tell them that if they don't you will cry
[3:44:13] <%BoxNavy> no and fuck you :)
[3:44:24] <@PeachSaliva> @siconia that’s advanced tech!
[3:44:30] <%DedlokPM> @Jaysky Thing is, MiHoYo has been working on mobile stuff for years. This is their first console game. Also technically their first PC game too if you count the fact that the closed beta for Genshin started before they ported Honkai Impact to PC
[3:44:33] <%BoxNavy> fuck fatalis
[3:44:42] <%AncelDeLambert> if you had any kind of good relation with a teacher, you'll probably get one when you ask
[3:44:42] <Siconia> Thank you I devised it myself
[3:44:49] <+Sp3ctre48> It's pretty standard
[3:45:06] <fuji_92> Paimon is funny as heck imo
[3:45:09] <Dragon_Batman> Maybe it's in specific spots?
[3:45:09] <+xeros720> i think it shows up more in the next zone
[3:45:12] <+D00msDayDan> you'll really feel the china when you get to liyue
[3:45:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt The Razor quest dialogue was kinda disorienting
[3:45:13] <+Sp3ctre48> Some people have a weird perception of anime games
[3:45:15] <%Aleate> ha
[3:45:16] <+Superbro64> I wish paimon just didnt exist, but other than that its fine
[3:45:17] <%Jrocy247> OOF
[3:45:19] <%Ranryu692> Tifa and Jessie are not flat >.>
[3:45:20] <%AncelDeLambert> MY problem that came up was that I left off asking for my second best recommendation until a few months before I needed it and the guy had QUIT and wasn't checking any of his email
[3:45:21] <+xeros720> also, some chinese comics really go that way
[3:45:28] <%weissguard> @PatStaresAt You know the ghosts you can guide back to the statues? Apparently, if you use your Elemental Sight on the empty statues, you can see which direction the corresponding ghost is in.
[3:45:39] <%Jrocy247> Bye Pat
[3:45:39] <%heartlesshealer> thanks for hosting
[3:45:42] <DracaenaLeaf> night
