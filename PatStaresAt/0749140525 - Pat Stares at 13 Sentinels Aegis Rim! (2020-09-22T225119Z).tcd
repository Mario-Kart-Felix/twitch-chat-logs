[0:06:41] <%ExpressNode> I don't think a lot of people remember Muramasa
[0:06:54] <@SoFarFetched> There was Kumatanchi which was on DS but only was released in Japan

[0:06:57] <%Jekado> Jekado subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Yeah! Aegis Rim, So at your advice I've decide to go through Yakuza 3-5. Finished 3 and am near the end of Shun's story in 4. 3's story wasn't too bad, it had slow start but a strong end. Some of those minigames sucked in 3 though.

[0:21:08] <+oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt how do you feel about Necrons?
[0:21:11] <IndoorSitup> This game's story is so fucking good, but the big "love it or hate it" factor is the RTS combat portions. Thankfully the game has difficulty options if you just wanna breeze through them or want them to be challenging.
[0:21:13] <%BoxNavy> im sad this isnt a brawler game

[0:37:22] <%alcors_wisdom> yeah because you dont have a first amendment
[0:37:22] <AthenaAegis> So basically they're that "Bless your heart" kind of nice Kappa
[0:37:22] <+skyheys> fucking quebecois
[0:37:23] <TrollKing96> Whats the difference from being nice and being polite?
[0:37:25] <CappuccinoGuil> @SilverFaustX it's like someone gave you a piece of shit that smelled of roses
[0:37:27] <$ringabal> American's will punch your face; Canadians spout rhetoric about your household for twelve minutes.
[0:37:28] <%BoxNavy> D:
[0:37:29] <%dante_must_die_exe> i'm so confused right now
[0:37:29] <leinadtonu> eh?
[0:37:29] <+deviljhojho_> they HATE it
[0:37:38] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> We are WILDLY non-confrontational
[0:37:39] <Aydarkzero> THIN
[0:37:42] <+BigCoffee> canadians just want to be left the fuck alone
[0:37:44] <+OwlLightningMage> British people are the same way
[0:37:46] <ha2ken> How can this be?
[0:37:51] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Canada: Oh we're bein real right now, eh? Naw, no thanks then.
[0:37:56] <londorpaleale> They saw my thin dick NotLikeThis
[0:38:00] <%Ranryu692> Canada HATES Genius Kojumbo
[0:38:00] <+dezimaly> this is better than the game to come
[0:38:02] <sosuke5> "I don't want a fight, so shut up"
[0:38:03] <assfordayz> "OH NO I hurt this person feelings!"
[0:38:06] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Americans must be OP in Canada
[0:38:08] <leinadtonu> why, I never!
[0:38:08] <+Jonesman64> THINN
[0:38:10] <CappuccinoGuil> @TrollKing96 being polite is doing things socially acceptable. Opening a door, saying "good morning" ""please" and "thank you". Being nice requires you to mean it
[0:38:10] <mark_collins45> We just sense Americans and we know what can rile them up.
[0:38:12] <Aydarkzero> Understandable, have a good day
[0:38:12] <ha2ken> The backdown
[0:38:12] <%Fenrirlives> Fenrirlives subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! Man this game sure did take a while to come out! let's hope this does well enough to NOT sink Vanillaware financially! I LOVE THIS DEVELOPER TOO MUCH AND I WANT DRAGON'S CROWN 2!

[0:38:13] <%Dementedpenguin> This sounds like the Internet when they get caught.

[0:38:48] <SilverFaustX> cause they fat ?
[0:38:49] <CappuccinoGuil> And it's only with Americans. NOBODY could tell I was Brazilian when I lived there

[0:39:35] <Mr_Strut> Holy shit, canada sounds awesome
[0:39:36] <%holydeviant1> Canadians can see floating ten gallon hats floating over American heads, like quest markers
[0:39:36] <Aydarkzero> well when i can
[0:39:36] <FunkyWaters> It's a sign of aggression
[0:39:37] <%SirKeigan> Good, I prefer it that way
[0:39:37] <%BoxNavy> why would i smile at someone i dont know thats creepyt
[0:39:38] <+Jonesman64> O Thank god for my resting bitch face.. No one will tell I'm American
[0:39:38] <$ringabal> They see our auras of corruption and fast food.

[0:39:47] <leinadtonu> :D
[0:39:47] <T_Sasquatch> That's weird

[0:39:52] <+MisterAvry> I didn't used to smile then retail made me smile and now I smile...
[0:39:55] <OperatorJo_> it's like clapping on planes.
[0:39:55] <marvel877> Smilin faces tell lies...
[0:39:56] <%SirKeigan> I hate having to smile at everyone I make eye contact with
[0:39:56] <TonyR2014> Southern culture, fam
[0:39:57] <CptHarlok> Wait. We're known for smiling? Could have fooled me.
[0:39:57] <T_Sasquatch> Don't smile at me weirdo
[0:39:58] <+oda_flobunaga> Today I learned I am a Canadian
[0:39:59] <Profmcstevie> I smile to my server, they are handling my things
[0:40:00] <%CzeekyPlays> Fuck it, I'll take "smiley" as an American trait over our bad ones anyday
[0:40:03] <%JamesCorck> Canadians only see movement, watch out.
[0:40:03] <+Dova573> As a Texan I dont do that
[0:40:03] <Arisato_II> The dog knows
[0:40:06] <DianaTheAscian> thats sad

[0:40:06] <%BoxNavy> i smile at the dogs yeah. people dont like when you do that
[0:40:07] <+BallerSwagBro9k> So Canada is Russia?
[0:40:13] <%holydeviant1> ...Did some of this leak into Seattle, because people complain about the cold shoulder here?
[0:40:15] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Fun fact: when in Canada, Americans radiate a red, white, and blue halo. Canadians us it as a defense mechanism.
[0:40:22] <Skatedeandre> i smile at people but thats only because my job requires me too
[0:40:26] <TonyR2014> Gotta do the white person acknowledgement smile

[0:58:10] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt can i ask when you first decided you wanted to buy this game? You seem very interested in this game without knowing to much about what the game is
[0:58:10] <+MisterAvry> Look, Pat. Now you can put this 13 year old procelain doll child into a naked robot combat!
[0:58:11] <+Tomschiii> most generic character design, holy shit

[0:58:40] <radicalApollo> The weird distorted nature of the music is oddly nice.
[0:58:41] <+xeros720> i wonder how many things will refer to 13 in this game
[0:58:45] <+kumaprime> I was still swimming in the sack in 85
[0:58:46] <+brightman42> is this a rogue-like?
[0:58:48] <HotMafia81> This music makes me want to nap
[0:58:49] <+fockniapo> the body of a child and the voice of a 4 balled man

[0:59:01] <FunkyWaters> Girls like it when you clip through them
[0:59:02] <+Jonesman64> wasn't this guy a rabbit dude before?

[0:59:14] <%AzureGale> I've been having weird dreams lately. Like, is any of this real or not?
[0:59:15] <ScreamLord> I wish I could phase through objects. Then maybe girls would think I'm cool
[0:59:16] <ThDark> That sounds like a euphemism, girls you can clip through effortlessly
[0:59:17] <%YakumoYomi> Beautiful 2D art? No surprise, given it's Vanillaware.
[0:59:18] <Mr_Strut> That shit was nuts

[1:17:43] <sterski> This is the first time I haven't been able to just skip the break
[1:17:48] <%Typhaeon> Chris you're incorrigible
[1:17:52] <%TonyR2014> Chris Hanson strikes again!
[1:17:53] <chrishansen69_> forgot my receipt
[1:17:59] <DJSquatch> I played this game for a review. Hold on to your butts boys and girls. This game gets WILD
[1:18:00] <+kumaprime> damn now I gotta stop watching. I wanna play it for myself
[1:18:01] <%justcallmebobplease> Chris Hanson cannot be stopped.
[1:18:08] <AFlyingTaco1> So how much of this is VN and how much is RTS?
[1:18:09] <%TheWinged7> @chrishansen69_ MORE subs?
[1:18:11] <+jameztheoriginal> neat
[1:18:11] <wibbwobbler> oh boy, the hero we deserve
[1:18:17] <%YakumoYomi> @CyrusVGZ Not very likely. Vanillaware games tend to be Sony exclusive (the one exception is the original release of Muramasa).
[1:18:21] <%DappercatEsquire> Chris, is this some kind of money laundering operation?
[1:18:22] <+bluedude153> where pat go
[1:18:28] <Darkfire346> I feel like this game is going to land me in Horny Jail
[1:18:28] <srcalavera94> do you even play visual novels or just watch em happen
[1:18:29] <CyrusVGZ> Shame.
[1:18:35] <$ringabal> Okay, but if this game has anything close to "Geofront" in it, I'm sold.

[1:18:54] <SomersaultJustice> you still didn't hit me
[1:19:00] <sterski> Yeah
[1:19:04] <CyrusVGZ> Imma bow out here then. I don't wanna be spoiled just in case Vanillaware ends up blessing me with a port.
[1:19:10] <AFlyingTaco1> For pee breaks, the bottom left text should say Pee Right Back
[1:19:11] <srcalavera94> he started but stop to pee all over the CD
[1:19:16] <%TonyR2014> Someone photoshop Pat's head onto Elmo so we can use it as a Pat goes Pee emoji
[1:19:21] <chrishansen69_> Im just convincing court I cant pay the bills Im supposed to pay, takes em longer to track none taxable bills
[1:19:22] <+samoorai> he's not coming back is he? :'(
[1:19:36] <Darkfire346> Gief has finally got Pat

[2:38:31] <%Profmcstevie> But....they seem to have 4 legs
[2:38:31] <+LTKonnor> @Struggleful Kind of counter intuitive to nuke your own country just to kill the enemy Kappa
[2:38:32] <FalseEyeD> "Extra Leg"

[2:39:48] <n3xus_nitro> bitch put on pants
[2:39:48] <+pectusumbra> Vanillaware putting their super details into mecha is really just the natural conclusion
[2:39:51] <ChoculaUltra> this would've been great on the Vita FeelsBadMan
[2:39:52] <+deviljhojho_> its certainly not ideal
[2:39:52] <0rond> this artstyle serves this very well, better than vanilla ware's standard
[2:39:54] <sterski> God DANG
[2:39:54] <mr_slaide> Dem thighs
[2:39:55] <%AFlyingTaco1> Hey, there ya go

[2:40:22] <Pyrrhus90> DEAD
[2:40:22] <+jetjagger222> 9S?
[2:40:22] <ChoculaUltra> BJ FeelsBadMan
[2:40:24] <%paladinstarbuster> GHOST BJ
[2:40:24] <+pectusumbra> I fully expect them to make super detailed and fiddly android girls sometime
[2:40:27] <+RowenCleric> them being naked in their mechs is the least sexual thing about this game
[2:40:28] <$RealThiele> BJ got sloppy and ended early
[2:40:29] <Arisato_II> F
[2:40:30] <Mr_Strut> Why do the cockpit portraits all have different angles?
[2:40:31] <+jiggy_snipe> I like his hat
[2:40:32] <$ringabal> BEEEEEEEEE JAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
[2:40:32] <overkrustice> @0rond Nah, Vanillaware has pretty much nailed everything the've done for the last couple decades
[2:40:38] <%AzureGale> Why are Byleth and Bernadetta piloting mechas
[2:40:39] <FalseEyeD> Just like BEYOND: TWO SOULS
[2:40:40] <ChoculaUltra> wait, Keitaro Miura?!
[2:40:41] <sterski> "Good thing this machinery is in the way"
[2:40:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Getting very much Darling in the Franxx vibes
[2:40:47] <+chicken_danger> THE FUTURE IS IN DANGER, BRING ME NAKED TEENS FROM THE PAST
[2:40:47] <heartlesshealer> someone else mentioned 17 and 19 earlier
[2:40:48] <chrishansen69_> Hmm nice.. I can keep on drinking instead of acting my leg messed up
[2:40:48] <DXLelouch24> wait yea isnt that 9S VA?
[2:40:52] <DianaTheAscian> is this 85 now?
[2:40:54] <mr_slaide> DAH BABY
[2:40:58] <+michingmallecho> if they have to be naked. It’s franxxx all the way 🌝
[2:40:59] <sterski> Why are all the cameras at different angles in the mechs?
[2:40:59] <zeif00> psaDogchamp
[2:41:00] <+applefibs> natsuno is my favorite so far
[2:41:07] <+michingmallecho> hasL hasL
[2:41:11] <%AFlyingTaco1> How do the cockpits even work? There doesn't seem to be any sort of clear seat or anything in any of them
[2:41:13] <ChoculaUltra> dude is 1 letter away from me shouting at him why he's not finishing Berserk LUL
[2:41:16] <$RealThiele> Whoredon got 5 teenagers with attitude
[2:41:20] <%Laecerelius> These robots have super janky cockpits
[2:41:21] <+AutechreTwinAphex> the strategy sections don't play like Front MIssion right?
[2:41:24] <%chiazam> MOAR
[2:41:25] <+aWanderingKaivo> I dig the space invaders icons for them
[2:41:25] <birdbones26> to get their good side
[2:41:29] <%AzureGale> @DXLelouch24 9S va is in the game but he doesn't voice Keitarou
[2:41:30] <%maenos2> they're all piloting different mechs so different setups i imagine
[2:41:31] <Kratok> Also so we don't have to see nude boys
[2:41:34] <FalseEyeD> "Perfect Position"
[2:41:35] <Triplicat> R A I L G U N
[2:41:35] <%logoth_> "perfect position"
[2:41:36] <+jetjagger222> @AutechreTwinAphex nope
[2:41:37] <+sadiebubs> I love these anime groans
[2:41:39] <SaltyAzteca> OH
[2:41:40] <%AFlyingTaco1> TAKE THE D-FORCE FULL FRONTAL
[2:41:41] <%BoxNavy> ok
[2:41:41] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> why is nobody looking at the cameras tho ?
[2:41:45] <Admiral_PopnFresh> FUCK YES
[2:41:50] <+rdark_ksu> i'm in the perfect position, bent over this console naked for some reason
[2:41:51] <chrishansen69_> Gotta ray it
[2:41:52] <0rond> @overkrustice yeah, but I always felt their backgrounds and vistas, and unusual angles look way better in their style than standard 2d side scrolling sprites
[2:41:52] <+chicken_danger> give me all of the nudes
[2:41:54] <%Laecerelius> USE YOUR D-CUPS OF JUSTICE!
[2:41:58] <+Jaysky> Biribiri
[2:42:03] <mr_slaide> YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:42:06] <+TheBitingIrish> Not just a fucking railgun, but a HEAVY railgun
[2:42:07] <gekizenbu> that robot is a topheavy boi
[2:42:08] <%BoxNavy> no
[2:42:08] <+Rada150> TURN PENIS INTO RO-BOT
[2:42:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> HYPE BEAM
[2:42:10] <wdga> oh you got it
[2:42:12] <birdbones26> hot
[2:42:17] <Sol_Install> k
[2:42:18] <arkv01> woolie is going to CREAM
[2:42:19] <DashXero> NERD
[2:42:20] <ChoculaUltra> that forehead scar is p rad ngl
[2:42:42] <sterski> The scar glows, too
[2:42:43] <chrishansen69_> Dont worry nerd, theres no ninjas around to cut our legs off
[2:42:53] <Vismal> I can already feel woolie all over this
[2:42:54] <+chicken_danger> fuck buildings
[2:43:04] <%Laecerelius> They're in convenient straight lines
[2:43:04] <%AzureGale> So do they operate the robots with their genitals or what
[2:43:13] <wdga> they block shots
[2:43:17] <Laveyrin> doesn't pierce
[2:43:19] <IndoorSitup> Woolie might not be a fan of the RTS combat
[2:43:24] <ChoculaUltra> it has to be genital related
[2:43:24] <%BoxNavy> this game doesnt look too bad honestly
[2:43:26] <chrishansen69_> yes, AzureGale, yes
[2:43:28] <+Rada150> say goodbye buildings
[2:43:30] <$RealThiele> its ok if you run out of power just smash the controls and get emotional power comes back immediately
[2:43:39] <%AFlyingTaco1> Does Woolie even like VNs?
[2:43:42] <+lostforte> is there supposed to be combat animations, or are they just turned off
[2:43:43] <+michingmallecho> remember the basics of CQC
[2:43:59] <ChoculaUltra> I mean Woolie's sat through both Dangaronpas
[2:44:02] <ChoculaUltra> and the spin off game
[2:44:10] <GuillermoDelAlan> If this game played a bit more like Wasteland 3, I might be more inclined to pick it up
[2:44:11] <ChoculaUltra> p sure he at least tolerates VNs to a degree.
[2:44:17] <DianaTheAscian> what year is this?
[2:44:20] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie likes Front Mission 3 and Dangaronpa
[2:44:23] <ChoculaUltra> monkaS
[2:44:29] <+pectusumbra> Every star in the sky is an enemy
[2:44:31] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:44:35] <SaltyAzteca> panic captain!
[2:44:36] <+fizzguy47> This ain't Front Mission
[2:44:37] <sterski> Scorched earth it is!
[2:44:37] <+Jaysky> Did Woolie ever do Ace Attorney?
[2:44:39] <%Laecerelius> That's a lotta bitches!
[2:44:43] <$RealThiele> WAT
[2:44:50] <GuillermoDelAlan> Twintail, that's a Pacific Rim name
[2:44:50] <@SoFarFetched> Its Hatsune Miku PogChamp
[2:44:53] <+RowenCleric> its...coming
[2:44:56] <$RealThiele> robo arm
[2:44:56] <+aWanderingKaivo> twintail robot kaiju, got it
[2:45:07] <ChoculaUltra> that question implies that there might've been unfriendly sentinels?!
[2:45:12] <+jetjagger222> this game has like the entire cast of fire emblem three houses
[2:45:14] <arkv01> uh, they can infest our mechs?
[2:45:20] <%AFlyingTaco1> Imma just slather this robot with my tits
[2:45:20] <chrishansen69_> Huh, this a fighting game now.. Call woolie!
[2:45:21] <+jiggy_snipe> Kappa all your high school friends
[2:45:21] <%logoth_> yuns are all nekkid
[2:45:22] <mr_slaide> NAKID
[2:45:27] <+LordDukeFishington> WHY ARE THEY ALL NEKED?
[2:45:29] <%AzureGale> We're going to have a massive robot orgy
[2:45:29] <FalseEyeD> doodLewd doodLewd doodLewd
[2:45:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> gotta get nekkie to save the world
[2:45:38] <%Konquerer> strip for the future of earth
[2:45:42] <%Laecerelius> Look, the robots require breast milk to operate
[2:45:44] <%AzureGale> Yes, let's DO this together
[2:45:45] <%AFlyingTaco1> So are these first five or so episodes just the prologue?
[2:45:47] <CappuccinoGuil> Ooooh that boy bi AF
[2:45:54] <+fizzguy47> forget the suit, just the plug
[2:45:54] <arkv01> this could've been where front mission went
[2:45:55] <+michingmallecho> this reminds me of super robot wars and now I’m sad that one of the old games which involves the end of Evangelion will never get an English translation psaFist
[2:45:55] <Kratok> Are they seriously not going to outright say "Highschool for mecha pilots" yet
[2:45:56] <+JustToWatch> so wait is there actually a reason why they're all naked
[2:45:57] <arkv01> but instead we got left alive
[2:45:58] <%Piemono> So are they laying on pads, or are their nipples getting mad chafed?
[2:45:58] <chrishansen69_> Tell woolie theres a naked short haired girl!
[2:46:05] <Manwad> Can you split move and action?
[2:46:06] <%Spydurman> psaBougie_SG
[2:46:09] <%Anger_Panda> A nudist Utopian future
[2:46:14] <quietshun> @aflyingtaco1 yep
[2:46:16] <IndoorSitup> N A N O M A C H I N E S
[2:46:18] <ChoculaUltra> maybe the pad is lubricated with mecha slime
[2:46:21] <+chicken_danger> im uncomfortable with balls exposed around heavy machinery
[2:46:33] <%TheGreatSkenardo> There are no nipples in the robofuture
[2:46:36] <$RealThiele> tower defense time
[2:46:40] <+fizzguy47> @arkv01 with no combat animation?
[2:46:47] <%WhereIsWill> SourPls
[2:46:52] <IndoorSitup> This fucking music Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:46:55] <chrishansen69_> Mine are small chicken_danger, so in no danger.
[2:47:06] <%AzureGale> I've gotta DO this
[2:47:14] <%AzureGale> What can I DO
[2:47:19] <ChoculaUltra> its crazy that this is all still technically the prologue/tutorial too
[2:47:20] <+AutechreTwinAphex> why can't Square Enix make a true Front Mission game again? that Left Alive shit was terrible
[2:47:25] <chrishansen69_> Only Woolie can!
[2:47:28] <ha2ken> These tracks
[2:47:41] <+michingmallecho> Left alive... daphScreechH
[2:47:41] <CappuccinoGuil> Miura is hella Bi LUL
[2:47:46] <+The1WhoKnoxx> can we get a turn based gundam game in this art style
[2:47:50] <gekizenbu> a Kaiju named Twintail? Is that an Ultraman reference
[2:47:54] <+jetjagger222> so its kinda real time with pause and not totally turn based
[2:48:01] <GuillermoDelAlan> @ChoculaUltra It's REALLY long
[2:48:13] <Blank9> this is a visual nightmare
[2:48:30] <+SuperCreeperBlocks> What the fuck am I looking at
[2:48:32] <%Dementedpenguin> @AutechreTwinAphex I thought Square could make a comeback after... Evolved... but then Left Alive happened NotLikeThis
[2:48:40] <%AFlyingTaco1> I just want my fucking Vita to let me play Lost Dimension goddammit
[2:48:42] <ChungusQuest> Into the Breach on acid
[2:48:45] <+fizzguy47> @the1whoknoxx why, SRW not doing it for ya
[2:48:45] <+AutechreTwinAphex> wonder why they didn't come out with a Switch version too - they could have easily made it work on that I think
[2:48:54] <+michingmallecho> I wish this was on switch though. Just for the portability
[2:49:00] <ha2ken> Half the city destroyed
[2:49:02] <%WhereIsWill> pat crushin it rn PogChamp
[2:49:03] <ChoculaUltra> yeah, actually thought this was a switch game too before I looked it up

[2:51:37] <BoneBagMel> Bellymousepad
[2:51:41] <%Ranryu692> tweet when you get back please?
[2:51:43] <ChoculaUltra> why is it always unreasonably attractive young adults that get to pilot the damn mechs?!
[2:51:45] <IndoorSitup> Y'all enjoying the game so far?
[2:51:47] <Arisato_II> 10 minutes, start the timer
[2:51:48] <heartlesshealer> delicious gamer cube
[2:51:52] <%Typhaeon> Well he mastered the grapple bite attack early
[2:51:54] <%WhereIsWill> whens PATS HOUSE: THE ANIME
[2:52:04] <IndoorSitup> SO IS THIS GAME RAD OR WHAT
[2:52:13] <%AzureGale> WHAT
[2:52:16] <ChoculaUltra> I think its p rad so far
[2:52:17] <+sugarfreemixup> so what vtubers are all of you simping over? mori, korone, and kiara are my favorites
[2:52:20] <+jetjagger222> its niche as fuck
[2:52:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Zangief shall consume even the Gamer Cube itself. Truly, he cannot be stopped
[2:52:25] <%WhereIsWill> its SOO ANIME I LOVE IT
[2:52:25] <IndoorSitup> BECAUSE I PLAYED THE JAPANESE VERSIONS AND IT WAS GREAT
[2:52:29] <+MisterAvry> yeah it's never the girl with a lopsided tit who plays with her lice that gets to pilot the mech
[2:52:30] <ChoculaUltra> story has me hooked, gameplay is kinda eh
[2:52:32] <$RealThiele> this game is so-so, the art and music are good but its pretty basic gameplay
[2:52:37] <%barkon345> holy crap that dog has gotten big
[2:52:59] <Ner234> @MisterAvry That's ... specific ...
[2:53:05] <chrishansen69_> Man this dog should be sheltered, elmo carried loads of Pat's crap
[2:53:06] <%AFlyingTaco1> This game is not something I would ever personally buy, but I guess I can watch Pat play through it today
[2:53:14] <IndoorSitup> Yeah the RTS combat might not be everyone's cup of tea
[2:53:23] <DianaTheAscian> anyone have the count on how many more podcast till stadia dies?
[2:53:33] <ChoculaUltra> you never see the kids who the teacher has to shout "you with the glue, stop eating that" piloting the mechs
[2:53:41] <IndoorSitup> @dianatheascian 1
[2:53:46] <+AutechreTwinAphex> it's gotten surprisingly high ratings - 90 from Gamespot, I guess Persona games made people give these games more of a chance
[2:54:01] <+MisterAvry> It's never a kid with a FUPA
[2:54:13] <+jetjagger222> i can think of two non-conventional mech pilots, coop and jiron from xabungle
[2:54:17] <%AFlyingTaco1> But at least ODST's Firefight is back
[2:54:19] <IndoorSitup> THIS GAME'S STORY IS ACTUALLY FUCKING GOOD
[2:54:23] <chrishansen69_> ChoculaUltra, you are never taught the lessons that are obvious. They happen in backrooms
[2:54:28] <quietshun> This game has amazing recuew scores
[2:54:28] <$ringabal> Anime art done real pretty helps that sorta thing
[2:54:33] <+jetjagger222> well everyone in xabungle is pretty weird lookin'
[2:54:33] <quietshun> *review
[2:54:38] <IndoorSitup> FOLKS IN JAPAN LOVE THIS GAME
[2:54:43] <+AutechreTwinAphex> dunno why there is no PC port though
[2:54:44] <%maenos2> google search tells me this game is fairly long, around 30 hours. wow.
[2:54:48] <+AutechreTwinAphex> or Switch port
[2:54:48] <$RealThiele> its story is only ok, the character interactions are good tho
[2:54:52] <ChoculaUltra> Megas XLR FeelsBadMan
[2:54:58] <$ringabal> Yoko Taro himself was taken in by this game
[2:55:06] <+jetjagger222> @ChoculaUltra i know right
[2:55:07] <+AutechreTwinAphex> I'll buy it on PS4 but I don't get why we are still not getting concurrent PC releases
[2:55:12] <quietshun> Sakurai too
[2:55:21] <IndoorSitup> @realthiele The story gets REAL good the more you dig in to it
[2:55:25] <ChoculaUltra> I just want to see more Okina teasing that Hijiyama guy with the prospect of boi pussy some more tbh
[2:55:33] <+AutechreTwinAphex> I'd rather not turn on my PS4 if I don't have to
[2:55:39] <%maenos2> here here
[2:55:45] <+jetjagger222> @ChoculaUltra i looked at spoilers and oh man
[2:55:50] <$ringabal> @chrishansen69_ "The dress stays on, thanks."
[2:55:55] <%AFlyingTaco1> When is TGS anyways? Or has it started already?
[2:56:00] <%maenos2> okino and the dumb alien girl are my favorites so far
[2:56:00] <ChoculaUltra> I love it.
[2:56:07] <+AutechreTwinAphex> wonder if this will be BC on PS5 too given that only certain PS4 games are going to be back compat
[2:56:09] <IndoorSitup> @jetjagger222 SHHHHHHUT THE FUCK UP
[2:56:22] <+MisterAvry> "uhh, can I wear like a body suit orr?" NO!
[2:56:22] <IndoorSitup> NO SPOILS PLS
[2:56:31] <%maenos2> @AutechreTwinAphex thought they said like 99% of ps4 games are gonna be playable on it?
[2:56:34] <%AzureGale> I hope Tsukasa is playable :p
[2:56:47] <ChoculaUltra> He better be!
[2:56:49] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @maenos2 yeah it'd be nuts if a game released this year wouldn't work
[2:56:53] <chrishansen69_> ringabal, suit yourself... I mean, its a saying
[2:57:00] <%YakumoYomi> I believe TGS starts on the 24th
[2:57:00] <ChoculaUltra> with optional wigs for the character portraits preferably.
[2:57:06] <ricotez> is this Playstation exclusive?
[2:57:08] <amonimis> they tested the "top 100" ps4 games and assume the rest will work but wont guarantee anything lol
[2:57:10] <+MisterAvry> Did they ever find out why they got randomly shoved into nekkid mecha?
[2:57:12] <DianaTheAscian> its a shame that the combat part of the game is the least interesting imo
[2:57:22] <ChoculaUltra> oh hey its Pat
[2:57:26] <%AzureGale> Was that 10 minutes
[2:57:28] <%maenos2> that was fast
[2:57:30] <pixelkenj> he cant be stopped
[2:57:36] <@SoFarFetched> I think he has a Money problem.
[2:57:36] <BoneBagMel> :O
[2:57:36] <%BinaryFireball> take a seat over here
[2:57:38] <DianaTheAscian> wif

[2:58:02] <DashXero> Chris Hansen likes the fanservice. Not because of the actual fanservice, but because he can tell people to "have a seat."
[2:58:02] <+MisterAvry> Maybe he's a bezos
[2:58:02] <%maenos2> THAT'S A LOTTA SUBS

[3:08:02] <+MisterAvry> That's a rather adult voice on that little twinkboy
[3:08:03] <%AFlyingTaco1> So they all lost except him in this timeline
[3:08:06] <$ringabal> GET BACK IN THE ROBOT
[3:08:06] <+BigCoffee> oh fuck there's more sentinels then 13

[3:08:32] <Jrocy247> What is this anime shit
[3:08:32] <mr_slaide> Power of friendship = Useless
[3:08:33] <pixelkenj> when they also use time travel
[3:08:35] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt MEGUMI MEANS GLASSES
[3:08:35] <+Taglog7> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[3:08:36] <%AlphaTauri> AlphaTauri subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! get in the robot Churro
[3:08:36] <%AzureGale> Is this how it ends? With a simple telephone call?
[3:08:37] <%Das_Bass> watch Dr.Who
[3:08:37] <+aWanderingKaivo> if they also have time travel
[3:08:38] <RetroCop87> The D-Force can also time travel?
[3:08:38] <%Calek> the aliens also have time travel maybe?
[3:08:39] <+reknownblackcat> this looks like nice anime
[3:08:39] <Bustahhwulf> when they are slowly traveling back in time with you
[3:08:40] <%Laecerelius> IF they ALSO have time travel
[3:08:40] <%Rumbutt> If that force also has time travel?
[3:08:40] <Mr_Strut> Maybe they can time travel better
[3:08:41] <mr_slaide> When they also have time travel?
[3:08:42] <DashXero> It's possible. Time Compression.
[3:08:44] <Gorgs7> an enemy force that also has time travel
[3:08:44] <wdga> a force that you can't defeat with time travel is the scariest shit possible
[3:08:45] <%Jekado> probably because time travel has its limits
[3:08:45] <chrishansen69_> Buy this game! Also, Im in no way affiliated with this games, and I kinda like it in a gay way I dont wanna admit
[3:08:45] <0rond> a force that attacks timelines @PatStaresAt
[3:08:45] <%Piemono> Ask the dude from Re:Zero
[3:08:46] <%AFlyingTaco1> If they can time travel too, it's not gonna be a good time
[3:08:46] <gronzen> Well if the other force also has time travel...
[3:08:47] <%Ynkubus_> Cos you can still fuck it
[3:08:47] <%Profmcstevie> They can kill us in the other timelines
[3:08:47] <+skyheys> when there are 0 timelines where you win
[3:08:48] <+JustToWatch> The enemy force also has time travel
[3:08:48] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt When you can't get advance enough to beat them even with time travel
[3:08:49] <The_Maddness> They probably ALSO have time travel?
[3:08:50] <+xGreenflame> Can't time travel if YOU'RE DEAD
[3:08:52] <Sol_Install> yep lol
[3:08:53] <%Pappajimbo> Pappajimbo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 20 month streak! I'm sure they picked 1985 because of back to the future
[3:08:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> When they can chase you through time
[3:08:55] <$RealThiele> all you need is kill did that well
[3:08:56] <el_patronn64> Time affects everything
[3:08:58] <+YabbaTroll> they also have time travel?
[3:08:58] <apiesdeathbylasers> multiverse theory
[3:09:01] <%machshop> holy boobs
[3:09:04] <+BigCoffee> Aliens are time travelling 1 node at the time to the past
[3:09:05] <Jrocy247> Time traveling aliens are insane
[3:09:08] <mr_slaide> Yes, tits?
[3:09:08] <%AncelDeLambert> let's see: you can run out of time travelers, you can run out of travel juice, you could straight go insane, you could get stuck, etc
[3:09:09] <AMUSERNAME> HOW
[3:09:10] <%AFlyingTaco1> Yes, Ms Tits?
[3:09:10] <RetroCop87> TWO BIG STUFFS IN FRONT OF MY FACE
[3:09:14] <DashXero> "I need you to focus the fuck up."
[3:09:15] <%AzureGale> 13 Sentinels extended universe
[3:09:15] <Jrocy247> Holy Booba Batman
[3:09:15] <The_Maddness> Also, when the timeline is not linear
[3:09:16] <mr_slaide> I am very focused.
[3:09:17] <%Laecerelius> I was focusing on your massive mammaries
[3:09:17] <Kratok> If you make your enemy threatening by also giving them time travel you're giving up
[3:09:17] <+chicken_danger> TIME CUBE MUST BE DEFEATED TO MAMORU YOUR FRIENDS
[3:09:18] <+DiabloDeAzul> The only way time travel can work in the story is that each time they travel, the timeline gets worse
[3:09:18] <%CrookedSpiral> Fujiko-san!
[3:09:19] <%shiplord13> Probably
[3:09:20] <CappuccinoGuil> If YOU can time travel, the aliens can too
[3:09:21] <%AFlyingTaco1> LUL
[3:09:22] <$RealThiele> definitely not tits
[3:09:22] <+michingmallecho> It’s aliens like the aliens from edge of tommorrow then
[3:09:22] <%YakumoYomi> She's totally Kongiku
[3:09:23] <+jetjagger222> the nurse is in on it
[3:09:24] <ThDark> She's all plot
[3:09:25] <The_Maddness> So going back in time doesnt help
[3:09:26] <Sol_Install> time travel only strong if A) the villains can't do it. 2) If there's no timeline to really change it
[3:09:32] <%shiplord13> He was erased from ti,e
[3:09:34] <+MisterAvry> She's totally staring at them too
[3:09:35] <chrishansen69_> Sorry, I gotta say.. Im not affialiated with this game, just to defend this game..
[3:09:35] <shotgang86> "he is now my left titty"
[3:09:37] <+The_H1R0> Why do the aliens bring time travel into the battle if they are that technologicaly advanced
[3:09:37] <+Dova573> HELLOOO NURSEEE

[3:16:47] <DXLelouch24> dont worry bout it
[3:16:47] <+jiggy_snipe> cuz shut up Pat
[3:16:47] <pixelkenj> 13 is the important one

[3:16:49] <%AzureGale> Why are you... naked?
[3:16:49] <%machshop> BONK
[3:16:49] <%BoxNavy> 13 characters maybe
[3:16:50] <%Laecerelius> Only 13 left?
[3:16:50] <RetroCop87> 1-9 got smoked

[3:16:51] <%AFlyingTaco1> Time for full glasses fucking boys
[3:16:51] <+BigCoffee> It,s the 13th sentinel Pat
[3:16:51] <Twoiis> 13 is the main character?
[3:16:52] <BlacSoul> dead
[3:16:52] <%Jekado> because the 13th one is probably the important one
[3:16:53] <%Konquerer> 13 is the coolest one
[3:16:53] <GeltonZ> Because there are 13 characters in the game
[3:16:53] <alephalpha> juro ios therefore the main characte
[3:16:54] <%DensityD> 13 + 13 = 26
[3:16:55] <%juxtest> Its a typo
[3:16:56] <+BigCoffee> they literally said it
[3:16:57] <%TheDullaMAN> There's probably just 13 left
[3:16:57] <Kratok> Oh :/
[3:16:59] <ha2ken> #13 is the only one you care about
[3:16:59] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt how did I know that they were gonna have to get naked to pilot the mechs?
[3:17:00] <stormhawk9891> Those are the last 13 maybe?
[3:17:01] <%baronblank> dammit, this game sounds really interesting but I suck at RTS

[3:17:08] <wdga> the start button
[3:17:09] <Noxyena> Because you only play as 13 of them
[3:17:09] <+Jaysky> Is that girl Morgana?
[3:17:10] <heartlesshealer> idk, maybe there's only 13 Sentinels -left-
[3:17:13] <+MisterAvry> "You like pigtails?"
[3:17:14] <%AzureGale> And here I thought G4 was the channel she was backing
[3:17:15] <ergulor> 13 characters maybe?
[3:17:16] <Mr_Strut> robit?
[3:17:17] <%bevyrage> it's not the number of sentinels that matters, it's the friends we watched die along the way
[3:17:17] <+Jaysky> I totally hear Morgana.
[3:17:25] <%DensityD> her start button is up her butthole
[3:17:26] <+CSNG> Why did the girl on the right put her camera behind her?

[3:19:52] <reddpop_> I thought they hadn't shown gameplay in the trailers. little did I know this is the actual gameplay
[3:19:52] <%bevyrage> EMP is definitely for missiles
[3:19:54] <Jrocy247> It'd be neat to see the robot's actually fighting the thing but this is cool too

[3:21:00] <%WhereIsWill> hmmmm
[3:21:01] <suikudo> SICK
[3:21:02] <chrishansen69_> Kaiserzelcor, have you watched two best friends?
[3:21:02] <stormhawk9891> IT FLIES
[3:21:03] <%AzureGale> So the pilots are running around the streets naked? No wonder it's in this style
[3:21:03] <SomersaultJustice> necrid must win
[3:21:03] <shotgang86> And its just and artwork, awesome
[3:21:04] <Daxalog> Does each characterr have their own music?
[3:21:05] <secretbosssauce> It looks like it should just fall over
[3:21:06] <+Rolandknight> you think woolie is going crazy for this game right now?
[3:21:06] <horse_disguised_as_horse> It has heels?
[3:21:09] <+skyheys> hips robot
[3:21:11] <%YakumoYomi> What? Noooooo
[3:21:14] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @mlow44 google the artwork - you probably don't want to know
[3:21:14] <+CSNG> Looks like the blade runner olympics guys
[3:21:15] <%Jekado> it can fly also
[3:21:16] <GeltonZ> Reverse leg with high heels XD
[3:21:17] <ammobasket> :/
[3:21:18] <+michingmallecho> And this is still the prologue daphAYAYA
[3:21:18] <$RealThiele> robotech called
[3:21:21] <godzookylives> Woolie would pay good money for their OnlyFans
[3:21:28] <+Kaiserzelcor> @chrishansen69_ I haven't
[3:21:29] <%Laecerelius> So it turns into a helicopter ball?
[3:21:29] <shotgang86> man why this cant be like front mission
[3:21:30] <The_Maddness> Im sure its just a coincidence!
[3:21:35] <heartlesshealer> Pseudo-Aerial unit?
[3:21:36] <VritraReiRei> So it's a Support Unit?
[3:21:36] <Jrocy247> I wonder if your Units die, is it perma-Death towards the story?
[3:21:40] <$ringabal> THEY MUST WIN
[3:21:47] <%king_wragles> Why does the girl robot have high heels?
[3:21:47] <chrishansen69_> godzookylives, Im a nihilist
[3:21:54] <%BoxNavy> she MUST win
[3:21:57] <+fizzguy47> no money for 3d animation, all of the budget went to the stripping animations
[3:22:00] <horse_disguised_as_horse> She's a sniper mech?
[3:22:01] <Victory_Boss> @Jrocy247 if any unit dies it's a game over
[3:22:02] <$RealThiele> well this is a rogue games so death is assumed?
[3:22:12] <The_Maddness> what are the points for?
[3:22:17] <gekizenbu> its visually appealing
[3:22:23] <Arisato_II> Is it really RTS?
[3:22:23] <%MisterRockett> RTS? It doesn't look like an RTS.
[3:22:25] <+A0N33> So I just tuned it but this shit looks rad
[3:22:26] <haitakaa> not a rogue like
[3:22:26] <Jrocy247> @Victory_Boss Ah, so no permadeath
[3:22:28] <+jetjagger222> you said it
[3:22:29] <+Kaiserzelcor> Do we get to see the robots fight
[3:22:29] <GeltonZ> @PatStaresAt Have you tried Ogre Battle? Because Ogre Battle was RTS with pausing.
[3:22:29] <+xerotwo> Is it reminiscent of Front Mission?
[3:22:30] <%MisterRockett> Is it because it's not an RTS?
[3:22:32] <suikudo> this is turn based
[3:22:32] <Daxalog> Its more of a Real Time Tactics game then RTS
[3:22:34] <%Profmcstevie> It is in fact RTS yes
[3:22:37] <+VoxelFox51> Wait is this an RTS?
[3:22:41] <%42nfl19> Wait so is it "live" or turn based? @PatStaresAt
[3:22:46] <The_Maddness> and RTT?
[3:22:47] <+GrandmasterBFunk> So it's an RTS put you have a big pause button?
[3:22:48] <$RealThiele> ah this doesnt turn rougelike
[3:22:54] <IndoorSitup> Why do people think she was stripping? She just pulled her shirt up a bit to hit the START switch on her abdomen.
[3:22:54] <+GundamF91> I wish this game was actually a 3rd Person Mech game and not a RTS with like Gifs of them battling and Images lol
[3:22:58] <Arisato_II> I'm seeing turns, so no RTS here
[3:23:00] <OperatorJo_> For some reason this is making me want to play Advance Wars 2 again.
[3:23:12] <Jrocy247> This track is banging man
[3:23:14] <%bevyrage> tactical real time strategy game
[3:23:17] <%Profmcstevie> We are just moving to each available mech as soon as they can move, so it looks turn based. It's real time
[3:23:18] <KaliasTV> Seems like an ATB system
[3:23:19] <chrishansen69_> 42nfl19 has a point.. we dont want no bg3
[3:23:20] <VritraReiRei> @Arisato_II if you dont issue commands the enemy will just perform actions so you have to do it at the correct time, hence RTS
[3:23:35] <ChungusQuest> Is this hybrid real-time, like FTL?
[3:23:37] <$RealThiele> yea modern wait style atb
[3:23:40] <wdga> lmao he said the line
[3:23:43] <Naho_Saenoki> GET BENT
[3:23:45] <%Deano8817> GET BENT
[3:23:46] <ChoculaUltra> hes from the 80s Pat!
[3:23:47] <heartlesshealer> Kanji's here
[3:23:47] <+Dova573> get bent
[3:23:50] <+xerotwo> GET BENT
[3:23:52] <%StrawberryPantsu> Get BENT
[3:23:52] <+jetjagger222> huh it is kinda like ATB
[3:23:53] <arkv01> get BENT old man
[3:23:54] <Jrocy247> GetbentGetbentGetbentGetbentGetbent
[3:23:54] <el_patronn64> Waaaat
[3:23:56] <%maenos2> he's from the 80s, isn't he? seems right
[3:23:57] <The_Maddness> make sure to stand in the damage circle
[3:24:00] <%juxtest> You saying I like dudes?
[3:24:01] <ShadeTheNovice> GET TURNT
[3:24:01] <+CSNG> Far out, man
[3:24:08] <%YakumoYomi> They have armor
[3:24:10] <+xerotwo> GET SMOKED
[3:24:20] <haitakaa> get lit fam
[3:24:23] <+ChrisAlgoo> this guy's cheesy like dante
[3:24:27] <godzookylives> Radical Dude
[3:24:28] <CappuccinoGuil> No point overthinking it
[3:24:30] <+jiggy_snipe> those Jamolers again Kappa
[3:24:34] <+jetjagger222> the sound effects are really good
[3:24:35] <%Anger_Panda> These combat sections are awful to look at
[3:24:35] <Arisato_II> @Arisato_II I'm seeing Pat taking his time a lot before taking action, that's not how Real Time works
[3:24:58] <%AzureGale> This isn't so HARD
[3:24:59] <wdga> clicking the right stick pauses so you can look around
[3:25:03] <ShadeTheNovice> This just seems like turns
[3:25:04] <ChoculaUltra> RTT is more apt for sure.
[3:25:04] <heartlesshealer> Pat, the missiles are firing
[3:25:08] <+jetjagger222> its real time with pause
[3:25:11] <Arisato_II> This is more like Valkyria Chronicles hybrid gameplay
[3:25:23] <%baronblank> im glad this appears to be totally not an RTS
[3:25:38] <%AzureGale> Rekt
[3:25:39] <chrishansen69_> This turn based stuff is so 2020, that 1990 stuff was faster paced
[3:25:44] <Jrocy247> So, in context, are they fighting in Virtual Reality, or is it in real life and all those people are dying?
[3:25:44] <+jiggy_snipe> thanks Gouto
[3:25:52] <arkv01> more POWER
[3:25:54] <$ringabal> THE FUTURE'S FUTURE'S FUTURE

[3:26:11] <%Wrashis> this seems like the kind of rts i can actually play. the fact that you can pause the real time to choose an attack really helps me
[3:26:11] <%Konquerer> and dead
[3:26:12] <%juxtest> Oops we shot missiles into the crepe factory

[3:39:13] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt Okay this guy in 22 is the lynchpin in explaining everything. Because he is the only common denominator to almost all these tales
[3:39:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Gouto's a nerd, nobody likes him
[3:39:13] <%Sanyle> Hows the game so far?
[3:39:14] <%Tenkay> I think those are all in the future Pat
[3:39:14] <+Pyroclase> Every scene in this game takes place in a completely unrelated timeline.

[3:39:21] <quietshun> The battles in the prologue are all the same fight
[3:39:23] <%AFlyingTaco1> We're jumping backwards in time for the story bits
[3:39:24] <Blank9> this is giving beyond two souls a run for nonlinear fuckall storytelling
[3:39:29] <%AzureGale> BUTTloads
[3:39:33] <+zeraux_> ORIN THE PAST
[3:39:35] <heartlesshealer> Non-linear forms of parallel storytelling are shit
[3:39:36] <%AFlyingTaco1> This is the present, the story bits are flashbacks
[3:39:37] <$lotharrio> Like what? A week?

[3:43:26] <Daxalog> Why are they exerting while shooting?
[3:43:42] <+zeraux_> @chat anything comparable interms of game play?
[3:43:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The higher the gen, the more anime the super-robot
[3:43:49] <+Kriptin> Controlled by their body parts and their mind is the justification
[3:43:53] <IndoorSitup> @daxalog Mechs are controlled mentalky
[3:43:57] <heartlesshealer> in the threat circle
[3:43:58] <+Pomer> i don't know what the fuck i'm looking at but i l know that i like it
[3:43:58] <$joylent_blue> Daxalog they control the mech with their bodies, hence the nekkidness
[3:44:00] <ovan20> @Daxalog because the mech has dick controls Kappa
[3:44:02] <heartlesshealer> nvm
[3:44:02] <Daxalog> Oh

[3:47:09] <NeuFK> is it turn based or real time?
[3:47:14] <%aishman> I love how like, this is like super basic graphics but it's representing this like, HUGE epic fight with hundreds of enemies
[3:47:17] <AMUSERNAME> Hey, Steve Blum announcements!
[3:47:21] <%aishman> @NeuFK Turn base
[3:47:24] <+jiggy_snipe> seems like a weird mix
[3:47:24] <IndoorSitup> @neufk Yes.
[3:47:34] <NeuFK> lol
[3:47:37] <+pectusumbra> Man, threw away my Hades run. But holy cow that fist charge attack is so cool
[3:47:37] <wdga> battles are genuinely fun
[3:47:39] <DianaTheAscian> @NeuFK both

[3:47:47] <%emperordread> Music giving me big Gundamn vibes
[3:47:55] <Jrocy247> Looks like this Game is a Pat's Thumbs up
[3:47:59] <+jiggy_snipe> that Aegis sure is good

[3:48:16] <+zeraux_> THATS A GREAT DESCRIPTION PAT
[3:48:16] <%Profmcstevie> It is more ATB than anything, characters can't act till they are ready and enemies will keep going if you don't set up an action
[3:48:18] <+Mundkipz> i thought woolie required perfect info

[3:57:23] <%Profmcstevie> I hate time travel plots so much dude psaWhat
[3:57:25] <IndoorSitup> T I M E
[3:57:26] <Mr_Strut> Is Iori the tiddy nurse?
[3:57:36] <Valor_13> This game any good?
[3:57:37] <+skyheys> Man, I kinda wish this had a plot instead of a series of questions.
[3:57:37] <0rond> am... am i iori?
[3:57:42] <Arisato_II> Iori was the first girl
[3:57:45] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt I feel this game would make more sense if they added the month, day and time with the year.
[3:57:45] <chrishansen69_> This shit all turned upside down. Time.. Incept it!
[3:57:50] <%AFlyingTaco1> No Iori is the original tiddy girl
[3:57:52] <+Jaysky> Few things of fiction pull of time plots well
[3:57:55] <mr_slaide> Occupation: Tits
[3:57:56] <+michingmallecho> isn’t this still the prologue🤔🤔
[3:57:58] <quietshun> we're still in the prologue people
[3:58:00] <%BoxNavy> @Valor_13 pats into it. chats mixed. i think its cool
[3:58:00] <+BigCoffee> @Onyxdeus this is literally 5 minutes after he woke up, jesus fuck are you even listening
[3:58:01] <Arisato_II> BUt I don't even know anymore, the MC has like 3 names already
[3:58:05] <+DiabloDeAzul> He's a time assassin
[3:58:05] <%Laecerelius> This isn’t just a time travel story but also an alternate dimensions story as well
[3:58:05] <Teyaric> @shiplord13 Mechanically impossible to do.
[3:58:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Wait, a body double? Terminator?
[3:58:15] <suikudo> he is a sleeper assasin
[3:58:16] <CrimsonGargoyle> BRUH WHY EVERYONE THICC
[3:58:19] <+Pyroclase> double tap the body just to be sure
[3:58:22] <suikudo> thats gotta be it
[3:58:27] <+skyheys> @boxnavy Its entertaining, which isnt the same as good
[3:58:27] <+AutechreTwinAphex> this feels almost like a LucasArts point and click
[3:58:28] <olaksi> It's prologue sure, but there is a good way to do media res and then there's this
[3:58:32] <%ssjklyco> Is this just Looper?
[3:58:32] <%BoxNavy> was jermaPluto
[3:58:33] <chrishansen69_> Yeah this game full of worm holes..
[3:58:35] <+BigCoffee> @quietshun they're not even trying, chat's just dumb

[3:59:57] <+AutechreTwinAphex> THIS IS POWER
[3:59:57] <Daxalog> Gameplay seems a little light and easy
[3:59:57] <Escherite> "Is that Johnny Young Bosch?" asks anyone playing a weeb game, ever
[3:59:58] <+xGreenflame> Under arrest for devil based crimes
[3:59:59] <0rond> it does sound quite similar
[4:00:03] <sosuke5> not everyone is a Vergil, Woolie
[4:00:07] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> This game is unbelievably anime
[4:00:09] <%Ranryu692> Is that Chris Parnell?
[4:00:11] <penitentpentwitch> Now to wait for Dante to show up
[4:00:11] <wdga> its still the tutorial. this is all prologue
[4:00:13] <+jetjagger222> JYB and lucien dodge do sound similar
[4:00:14] <KaironFortressKnight> slap a vergil mode sticker on this games cover
[4:00:17] <chrishansen69_> I was led into this situation..
[4:00:18] <%Kiyosuki> Another selling point for Woolie
[4:00:21] <+AutechreTwinAphex> I guess crazy Reuben sat this one out eh?
[4:00:24] <Gamer4life824> They just left the hot woman on the ground didn't even say a thing about her

[4:01:57] <DianaTheAscian> yeah
[4:01:57] <%coreyyotto> a time grid, if you would
[4:02:00] <+jiggy_snipe> this is still the prologue I think LUL
[4:02:01] <+Link232> Why not a big cube of time instead?
[4:02:02] <%ssjklyco> A cube grid
[4:02:02] <arkv01> there's no time you must hurry
[4:02:03] <+yukichocomilk> GRID
[4:02:04] <Arisato_II> No Pat, no grid
[4:02:05] <%Bt_Robot> THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TALK
[4:02:06] <$joylent_blue> That was NOT JYB, guys. That VA was Lucien Dodge, or Felix from FE3H
[4:02:06] <KaironFortressKnight> BIG NANI
[4:02:07] <ChungusQuest> oh god, this DOES feel like Homestuck now

[4:02:09] <AMaidIndeed> IT'S PEPE SILVA!!!
[4:02:09] <amonimis> that grid is a thing in the menus i thought
[4:02:10] <+CSNG> Don't these character already know each other?
[4:02:10] <Teyaric> But it would be useless, and irrelevent, Pat.
[4:02:15] <%coreyyotto> a cube might even be better
[4:02:15] <suikudo> You need a pin board and some yarn
[4:02:16] <chrishansen69_> Pat and I were strange horses.. I met him on on some youtube videos. He was back with matt at the time.. Now he doing strange sex games in outta nowhere, supporting him was risky.. but its aight.. Cause big grid \

[4:04:20] <RetroCop87> It's Looper with 13 Loops
[4:04:22] <chrishansen69_> Good choice.. resi 3 is the worst choice though
[4:04:22] <wdga> final tutorial lets goooo
[4:04:22] <+skyheys> WHAT: The Game
[4:04:23] <%coreyyotto> It's very Siren-esque
[4:04:26] <+Jaysky> It feels like way to much to get at the start
[4:04:29] <%Dementedpenguin> We're still in the tutorial too LUL
[4:04:30] <+Pyroclase> Yeah it feels like a series of books more than a game
[4:04:30] <tattleworm> it's like eight different animes crammed together, every one of these could be their own story
[4:04:30] <%ssjklyco> It's 5 Kojima stories
[4:04:31] <+Jaysky> *too
[4:04:32] <%AFlyingTaco1> Oh god finally near the end of the prologue

[4:04:46] <+aWanderingKaivo> they show a timeline at the end and its just a bowl of spaghetti
[4:04:47] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> @anangryhamster That is EXACTLY what I was thinking!
[4:04:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think this might be the most anime game ever.

[4:05:52] <+ThatOneTranslator> hijiyama's from 1945
[4:05:57] <+Jaysky> Always has been @AFlyingTaco1 cirCop
[4:05:59] <%WhereIsWill> its about to get REAL
[4:05:59] <+CSNG> These characters are hard to tell apart
[4:06:00] <DianaTheAscian> i've lost rack of whos who
[4:06:01] <%AFlyingTaco1> Who? Huh?
[4:06:03] <%Anger_Panda> IT'S A MAD MAD MAD MAD APOCALYPSE
[4:06:08] <DianaTheAscian> track*
[4:06:09] <FalseEyeD> Imagine trying to pick this game back up
[4:06:12] <%Spydurman> Pat = lulwut?
[4:06:12] <+skyheys> ?????
[4:06:18] <olaksi> What? When? Why? Who`?
[4:06:23] <blackbookalpha> Why's Gamora!?
[4:06:27] <Jrocy247> SourPls
[4:06:27] <+jiggy_snipe> nice hat
[4:06:27] <%AzureGale> Now the real test begins
[4:06:30] <%YakumoYomi> 120 seconds
[4:06:35] <%Profmcstevie> Pat don't you EVER drop this game for more than a week, you'll never remember what the fuck anything is
[4:06:35] <+Renkaru> this like some front mission shit
[4:06:37] <DXLelouch24> we NEED to push this to Woolie everyone, WE NEED TO
[4:06:39] <DXLelouch24> HARD
[4:06:43] <suikudo> what training!?
[4:06:47] <AMaidIndeed> What training?!
[4:06:51] <gekizenbu> we're going to need a cork board for this videogame
[4:06:54] <Jrocy247> @DXLelouch24 Woolie would LOVE this
[4:06:54] <wdga> final tutorial, fuck it have a big fight
[4:06:58] <quietshun> Hopefully Pat sells it on the Podcast
[4:07:04] <+Jaysky> Woolie would have to remember everything about this tho
[4:07:06] <FalseEyeD> Yeah, if you drop this game, forget it
[4:07:09] <+Pomer> @DXLelouch24 Woolie would have a fucking panic attack and you know it
[4:07:11] <suikudo> This is never gonna come to pc is it
[4:07:20] <+jiggy_snipe> yea Woolie Reggie and Minh need to experience this
[4:07:22] <mr_slaide> USE TACKLE
[4:07:24] <+michingmallecho> I guess the real sentinels we made were the friends we made along the way
[4:07:25] <anAngryHamster> Is this still the fucking tutorial!?
[4:07:26] <devanmuse> I read Umineko and that was easier to follow than this plot
[4:07:29] <DXLelouch24> @Jaysky thats why we have Minh remember it instead
[4:07:30] <%Profmcstevie> Woolie would HATE this game, look at all these numbers and possible mistakes. His brain would collapse
[4:07:36] <gekizenbu> @anAngryHamster YEP
[4:07:48] <blackbookalpha> Mind Goblins
[4:07:50] <+CSNG> The only story I know so far is timeline dimension aegis world dimension big ass
[4:07:52] <gekizenbu> this is still the prologue
[4:07:54] <+Pomer> @Profmcstevie that's what i'm saying!
[4:08:03] <suikudo> flyers heading to the terminal
[4:08:12] <FalseEyeD> This is NOT a Woolie game
[4:08:13] <%Kiyosuki> But it has mechs, short haired girls, a guy with the voice of Nero, a bancho...
[4:08:15] <Jrocy247> @DXLelouch24 That's the best Part1
[4:08:22] <suikudo> This game is fucking rad
[4:08:29] <chrishansen69_> Profmcstevie, take action and force him to watch
[4:08:36] <+zeraux_> this game reminds me of a ps1 game in the best possible way
[4:08:37] <+GundamF91> You can't stop playin this game for too long or good luck remembering anything
[4:08:40] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Dont you love it when you arent notified your favorite streamer is on and look at your phone and realize he's been streaming for 4 hours TakeNRG
[4:08:41] <$joylent_blue> Kiyosuki it wasn't Nero's VA, it was a VA named Lucien Dodge
[4:08:43] <DXLelouch24> hell Dan Southworth is in this game
[4:08:47] <DXLelouch24> its perfect for Woolie
[4:08:56] <+Loinclothiclese> This is not what i wanted form vanillaware at all im straight up bored
[4:08:56] <%Kiyosuki> Oh, well he sounds like him
[4:09:06] <+zeraux_> I NEED MORE SENTINEL POWER
[4:09:06] <$joylent_blue> DXLelouch24 it wasn't Dan
[4:09:13] <DXLelouch24> legally distinct Johnny Yong Bosch
[4:09:19] <olaksi> This is is very bad in an entertaining way
[4:09:20] <DXLelouch24> legally distinct Dan
[4:09:20] <DianaTheAscian> this game has almost all the woolie bait
[4:09:21] <+ChrisAlgoo> so none of the sparda boys are here? dang
[4:09:44] <+jiggy_snipe> legally distinct Sparda boys
[4:09:49] <prime_name> Hamilton?
[4:10:04] <chrishansen69_> Im not woolie.. I just had money to spare. Seriously, get woolie in here though
[4:10:11] <%AzureGale> Kyoko gon' tear apart the kaiju
[4:10:18] <Jrocy247> MAN, I fucking WISH Atlus would bring Muramasa out of Vita Hell
[4:10:19] <+Jaysky> Is there a tanned tomboy though? I know there's short haired spat girl, but is there tan?
[4:10:22] <%Kiyosuki> plus I don't know why people are acting like woolie's never played an RTS before
[4:10:30] <+jiggy_snipe> so is Pat is controlling like 10 people now?
[4:10:36] <+ChrisAlgoo> fuckin sick
[4:10:37] <+Jaysky> Muramasa is on Wii too
[4:10:37] <+Dova573> muramasa is on switch i think
[4:10:38] <%BoxNavy> atlus doesnt remember muramasa happened.
[4:10:46] <DianaTheAscian> oh wow

[4:11:18] <%BoxNavy> @ExpressNode yeah thats the problem
[4:11:18] <Jrocy247> Muramasa is on the Wii yes, but it doesn't have all the new content the Vita version has
