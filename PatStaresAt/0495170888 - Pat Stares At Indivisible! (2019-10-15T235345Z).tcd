[0:43:09] <%GingaNZ> apatDab
[0:43:13] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yeah you were looking a little ragged and worn out by the end of it. Instead of a four-day block is there any way to space out your stream days a bit? You might find it helps. Like 2 blocks of 2. I go mon/wed/fri/sun (aussie time) and I find it way better than when I tried a block of days.

[0:46:07] <%RubberFistFight> Fallout 76's shitshow was a completely different brand of crap though. It was ripping players off and generally being a bunch of chucklefucks. Blizzard's brand of crap is "Why are you angry that we're cozying up to human rights violators and actively appeasing them by abusing our fanbase and affiliated creators?"

[1:11:41] <%blaccbird914> Thorani is the best character in this game hands down
[1:11:44] <IminyourBase> he henshin is cool
[1:11:45] <fantom_flasch> I think it was the whole thing
[1:11:45] <coracor> based trigger

[1:11:52] <narusao> big long... got it
[1:11:55] <Ominnous> longer than Shantae Pogchamp
[1:11:55] <+Sulfur_Boride> So the story for this game is nowhere as epic and dramatic as the intro OP sounds.
[1:11:55] <segbas2004> well worth the money only for that
[1:11:56] <King_Wolf_Rigger> that's pretty cool
[1:11:56] <Yummy_Nukes> is this a big amine?

[1:12:16] <$realm_forge> This should be an anime
[1:12:17] <millamoks> yea, very Armor of Vay like
[1:12:18] <$SvenHolgersson> PLAY IT AGAIN
[1:12:19] <%VantomPayne> that end is a bit wacky
[1:12:19] <ミュウレ4242> if the audio quality was way worse, it'd be a lot like a sega cd game.

[1:35:57] <+SideshowMessiah> Use it. Woolie doesn’t.
[1:35:57] <$MajorCrasher> oh yeah, dhar is nuts
[1:35:57] <DSD24> Lucca worse than Dhar
[1:35:57] <Monkeyweed21> LVL-26
[1:35:58] <Thorn14> "do nothing for 12 turns"
[1:35:58] <+Skyebaker> u always keep Dhar in ur party
[1:35:58] <+justianxix> that frame Kreygasm
[1:35:59] <Zalthia> Dhar is my son
[1:36:00] <+LastHazzerd> do combo
[1:36:01] <WarchiefGoldva> It's VERY useful. Dhar's neutral hits are very powerful when buffed with Earthern Fury.
[1:36:01] <+Skyebaker> hes op
[1:36:01] <%marsano168> Dhar is legit amazing gameplay wise
[1:36:02] <lotharrio> His enhancing move has a quick recharge on his action and it greatly increases his damage.
[1:36:05] <Quietshun13> lorenz alter
[1:36:06] <Tytangamer> And the charges persist between battles.
[1:36:09] <%Mendin> Combosss
[1:36:09] <$Chimeraelite> ^
[1:36:09] <%Kirby_Sauce> meter
[1:36:10] <beefcakemanthrob> dhar is about burst damage
[1:36:14] <%PlagueOfGripes> So it seems like it's mainly for stocking for strings with slower characters or for phases where you cannot attack yet
[1:36:15] <%Kirby_Sauce> burn meter
[1:36:16] <%Takreth> @CalderGaming yeah no kidding. Dude's got gams
[1:36:20] <AdmiralButtloaf> 69 Nice
[1:36:24] <+justianxix> thats some Melia shit
[1:36:25] <KUYAmoPESh> I never took Dhar out of my party.
[1:36:25] <%PipIV> 69 damage. nice
[1:36:25] <$SvenHolgersson> I hope theres alot of 3 houses characters in this game
[1:36:26] <%Muzzle131> Roti best summon
[1:36:26] <%GrayMatterMiner> where's the mam's axe
[1:36:26] <$MajorCrasher> btw Pat, multihit attacks can be blocked multiple times
[1:36:28] <%tizz86> can store 12, not 15...
[1:36:29] <Dementedpenguin> Damn
[1:36:32] <$SvenHolgersson> I didnt see the cast list
[1:36:33] <%GrayMatterMiner> no it isnt
[1:36:34] <blackorchidKI2> Dharlington
[1:36:35] <%Deadpal> ok murderer
[1:36:35] <Zalthia> Eh, I build up charges whenever I can
[1:36:36] <@SSaryn> Ye Dhar pairs good with people like Ramzi
[1:36:37] <%Muzzle131> MURDERER no free will
[1:36:38] <Ultimatefool> DEEHAR
[1:36:38] <UnfilteredComic> FUCK DHAR
[1:36:38] <star_feline> Ok murderer :)
[1:36:40] <+Skyebaker> keep dhar in top slot ur golden
[1:36:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> So why didn't pops teach you this brain technique BEFORE?
[1:36:44] <%cherubs_anonymous> Iaijutsu earthbender
[1:36:44] <gameever> I wonder if the ending of the game will be like Wonderful101 and all your stands will come out and fight the boss together at the end
[1:36:47] <Yummy_Nukes> DHURRRR
[1:36:48] <%SilvaChariot0133> NO BULLY BibleThump
[1:36:49] <ClairvoyantNara> Fuck Dhar
[1:36:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> If y'all are complaining aqbout the pacing of the intro being too fast, y'all need to widen your horizons for video games.
[1:36:56] <Thorn14> that one attack Dhar has is fucking Carmine's jump forward heavy
[1:36:58] <+SideshowMessiah> Shut up Dhar.
[1:36:59] <%PlagueOfGripes> the game's combat is Fast Characters = Off Global Cooldowns. use them in between big strings to max your dps. that sort of thing
[1:37:00] <%Kirby_Sauce> @MajorCrasher Even multi hit ones from your mother?
[1:37:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> TIME TO JUNGLING
[1:37:01] <Thorn14> in Uniel
[1:37:02] <ミュウレ4242> welcome to the jungle, baby.
[1:37:05] <majindusto> Hes also Numbuh 1 / Nigel Uno in "Codename: Kids Next Door"
[1:37:07] <panic_rabbit> Hurrr Dharrr
[1:37:09] <foreverN2dust> she looks up at the map PogChamp
[1:37:10] <arkv01> have we talked about ajnas inconsistent voice acting yet?
[1:37:21] <+Skyebaker> time better or tap per hit for parries
[1:37:23] <%Kirby_Sauce> METER BURN
[1:37:24] <lotharrio> It's a bit confusing at times, but I'd also suggest changing combat facing so that you always have static front and back rows.
[1:37:24] <dickbuttwoman> 12
[1:37:26] <dickbuttwoman> It told you
[1:37:26] <%anticrust> 12
[1:37:26] <%ape_hawk> 12
[1:37:27] <krymzen5> 12
[1:37:28] <%Scottigecko> 12
[1:37:28] <NeroInfinite> 12
[1:37:30] <blackorchidKI2> @majindusto I recognize that tone in his voice, too. I thought it was Ben Disken.
[1:37:30] <joedatuous> its inconsisten?
[1:37:31] <%Kirby_Sauce> 12
[1:37:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> Why's everybody gotaa find a reason to hate on everything?
[1:37:33] <%BoboDaHobo> wait, I've only been paying half attention to the game, is she just buddies with the guy who murdered her dad now?
[1:37:36] <+Skyebaker> time better or tap per hit to parry
[1:37:37] <%PanicSwytch> so this like tales style combat
[1:37:42] <$MajorCrasher> the stacks carry over between fights too
[1:37:44] <arkv01> yeah sometimes she has an accent and sometimes its no accent
[1:37:45] <Zalthia> It IS Ben Diskin
[1:37:45] <arkv01> its jarring
[1:37:46] <Thorn14> People are always negative
[1:37:47] <Monkeyweed21> you use 1 stack per attack
[1:37:48] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[1:37:49] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat It doesn't do more damage its just how many attack you get modified.
[1:37:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> @BoboDaHobo No, he's trapped in her brain
[1:37:52] <+LastHazzerd> it's not additive
[1:37:53] <NeroInfinite> You don't have the power yet
[1:37:55] <WarchiefGoldva> It's very strong. Buffed Dhar does a shitload of damage.
[1:37:56] <DocMadfox> @BoboDaHobo He's her slave now because she vored him into her brain
[1:38:00] <pectusumbra> 12 but they are charges
[1:38:01] <heartlesshealer> It's more that his normal attacks have low cooldown, so the charges get used on each of those swift attacks
[1:38:03] <%Kirby_Sauce> use meter
[1:38:05] <Quietshun13> @panicswytch kinda, more valkyrie profile
[1:38:07] <devanmuse> can toy strike multiple times at once with stocked charges?
[1:38:07] <%GrayMatterMiner> do combo
[1:38:11] <%TheMattman1313> OOOOOHM
[1:38:13] <%PipIV> @bobodahobo yup?
[1:38:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> pat this has metroid style areas where you gotta come back later with new powers
[1:38:13] <%demegodz> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:38:13] <NJigglypuff> @BoboDaHobo not exactly buddies. she trapped him in her mind palace, and he can only come out during battles. a temporary truce was called
[1:38:20] <%Mendin> Time for Best Girl
[1:38:21] <$SvenHolgersson> FUCK YES I CAN

[1:42:26] <WarchiefGoldva> @AngriestPat You already have access to your supers. Hold the associated button + character button to spend it. Juggles give you more meter but up attacks tend to do less damage as a tradeoff.
[1:42:28] <DocMadfox> Razmi's Hinata that's sick of everyone's shit

[1:45:14] <%jiin6> Mind summoning the axe flash
[1:45:17] <WarchiefGoldva> @AngriestPat That flash is just for show. Animation-wise, so they don't have to draw her putting the axe away or whatever.
[1:45:17] <heartlesshealer> like your party members
[1:45:19] <Sokumotanaka> yeah pat actively avoided the demo
[1:45:23] <+JacknZack27> You summoning the axe is the flash

[1:46:57] <%littleogre92> @Chatterbox1991 It sounds like the music from the Tangled level.
[1:46:58] <DigbyMayor> Razmi’s uppercut is a really good launcher
[1:46:59] <Louie_Salmon> Don't worry about trying to figure everything out so fast, a lot of mechanics are gonna get thrown at you
[1:46:59] <WarchiefGoldva> There's nothing to the left right now, tbh.
[1:46:59] <Rada150> so yeah i saw german spy stream this it starts good then gets bad

[1:47:07] <%Shadicara> LUL
[1:47:08] <etnoika> Man this game is great but they really messed up by giving you two of the best waifu/husbandos right at the start.
[1:47:08] <%blaccbird914> axe can climb walls
[1:47:10] <marvel877> You can also see your map in the pause menu, Pat

[1:47:25] <marvel877> Axe to climb walls, pat
[1:47:25] <%Cn_alpha_02> Attack walls with ax.
[1:47:27] <%marsano168> axe climb doesnt unlock until you get the tutorial guys
[1:47:30] <UnfilteredComic> @rbakervv He can, game just hasnt told him yet
[1:47:30] <WarchiefGoldva> You only get axe climb after you get your first Ringsel. It's different than the demo.
[1:47:34] <suikudo> smooth
[1:47:40] <heartlesshealer> Does Dhar keep his stocks between battles? It looked like it earlier, but I'm not sure...
[1:47:44] <rbakervv> @UnfilteredComic excatly, spoilers
[1:47:50] <dickbuttwoman> Need a button
[1:47:51] <%Mendin> TIGER UPPERCUT
[1:47:54] <%Dutchpotato> @heartlesshealer yes it’s super op

[1:48:04] <Thorn14> this is a lot like Valkyrie Profile
[1:48:06] <Thorn14> and 100% ok with that
[1:48:08] <+plowman35> Pat figured it out faster than woolz
[1:48:09] <%drfaustisdead> @heartlesshealer yes stocks carry over through fights.
[1:48:14] <heartlesshealer> Okay yeah, that's pretty strong for getting to have 12 carrying over
[1:48:15] <Louie_Salmon> @etnoika Moist Mom and Yo Ho Hoe are pretty strong tho
[1:48:16] <matheuspomp> oof
[1:48:17] <Rada150> this company should have just made skullgirls 2
[1:48:17] <+Skyebaker> stocks carry over through fights
[1:48:21] <%Mendin> Everyone has a meter burn, but Razmi's is noted as a heal
[1:48:26] <%Animorphimagi> No block
[1:48:27] <+Skyebaker> u can get a training mode
[1:48:27] <+HyperCharge_Sam> it totally does tho

[1:50:58] <Rada150> @Siebersboy don't i watch german spy play this it gets bad later, the game was unfinished
[1:50:58] <BigNerdSam> Zone has all the audio Zone needs
[1:51:08] <%ThePuddingDead> blocking is incredibly useful and pretty much sets up how a fight will end, whether your higher lvl or not
[1:51:09] <coracor> did that thing just get snapped
[1:51:09] <+Skyebaker> get with the parry u mook
[1:51:09] <Pat_Squared> @tuesti for me its that most fights even boss fights turn into fights with not much going on.

[1:51:22] <Louie_Salmon> @tyrant00000 This one bar of iddhi isn't really how combat is gonna work for most of the game, so sorta pointless to train in it
[1:51:24] <+Skyebaker> u did parry
[1:51:24] <%Kirby_Sauce> razmi isn't the only one with a meter burn
[1:51:26] <lotharrio> Perfect block will give you... 1 health, I think, yeah, so you'll never die as long as you can perfect block.
[1:51:26] <%SilvaChariot0133> Blue is parry
[1:51:29] <%SilvaChariot0133> Pink is block
[1:51:30] <%ThePuddingDead> nope
[1:51:31] <+Pixel_Matt> damn
[1:51:32] <%Albadabar> blue is parry
[1:51:32] <matheuspomp> lvl 1s
[1:51:32] <UnfilteredComic> It is, Blue shield is perfect timing
[1:51:33] <+Skyebaker> blue is parry pink is block
[1:51:34] <%jiin6> Emoshuns
[1:51:34] <+runningfleet> razmi is the love interest
[1:51:35] <+LastHazzerd> that's the parry
[1:51:36] <%Albadabar> grey is block
[1:51:36] <WarchiefGoldva> You were doing the parry.
[1:51:38] <arkv01> its kinda like fear boners, you keep banging but you know it ain't right
[1:51:39] <%ThePuddingDead> well timed blocking is teal
[1:51:39] <%PauliusMaximus> the parry is on the world map only
[1:51:39] <%PlagueOfGripes> no you parry poorly
[1:51:40] <joedatuous> you are dont listen to them
[1:51:44] <%Mendin> Just-Guard is the parry
[1:51:44] <+tuesti> @rada150 why do you say it was unfinished?
[1:51:45] <+SleazyShell> One guy
[1:51:46] <$SvenHolgersson> Razmi is the best waifu
[1:51:49] <%PauliusMaximus> the blue in battle is a just guard
[1:51:53] <%PlagueOfGripes> parry shames
[1:51:53] <%Metballs> Parry 110% of teh time
[1:51:54] <benjiFG> bless u pat

[1:52:10] <%skizzuto> @AngriestPat you can also just press R1 whenever (even when not doing a super) to stop time and take stock of a situation
[1:52:10] <Louie_Salmon> The block into attack thing is just for the overworld, you're doing the right thing during fights
[1:52:12] <@lewdskeletor13> So we’re gonna eventually become best buds with our father’s murderer huh?
[1:52:13] <+LastHazzerd> i love them
[1:52:13] <SleepyMaribo> you can parry enemies on the world map and counter

[1:52:48] <Rada150> alot of playable characters were cut near the end of the game there is a part that feels rushed and doesn't mesh well with the narrative there is a supposed leak by an insider too saying the game got rushed at the end for budget reasons
[1:52:50] <+Pachi3000> We have committed to lives of celibacy!
[1:52:51] <WarchiefGoldva> @tmix1600 It's okay, Zone only made the bosses and some limited Ajna poses.

[2:01:41] <Louie_Salmon> They're in the normal RPG people-stack, not the mind palace
[2:01:42] <marvel877> Stop with the jump ins.
[2:01:44] <$SvenHolgersson> WAS THAT COMBO
[2:01:44] <inz0mbiac> Pat always jumping in
[2:01:45] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @Pat_Squared Ginseng is still the best healer for me and I've just beaten the Serpent Queen. I love Thorani but I can't get her to heal herself.
[2:01:47] <%ThePuddingDead> he gun die
[2:01:50] <%Mendin> Dhar's meter-burn is pretty potent
[2:01:52] <arkv01> consume ressurrection lilies for more time on the clock
[2:01:53] <Fear_Ranjer> YO who is that lil lad next to Dhar?!
[2:01:58] <lotharrio> Longer combos will add damage multipliers.
[2:02:03] <foreverN2dust> damage seems so high
[2:02:04] <majindusto> NEVER STOP JUMPING IN
[2:02:05] <$SvenHolgersson> Rotti? hes cool
[2:02:06] <+Pachi3000> Dhar and his good friend Roti
[2:02:07] <%PauliusMaximus> thats roti
[2:02:08] <%AgentOrangeShoes> Babby Blanka-dorf
[2:02:17] <suikudo> and you are getting your ass handed to you in it

[2:02:20] <garbageheaphound> yeah and you suck
[2:02:21] <UnfilteredComic> Man these guys could make a really good fighting game 4Head
[2:02:22] <Caidezes> You kinda need to block.
[2:02:23] <narusao> ib4 pat loses at baby fighting game
[2:02:23] <%moogleboy1984> you better get real good at Parrying
[2:02:23] <%ThePuddingDead> pat did you ever valkyrie profile?
[2:02:24] <%Mendin> You can tell it's an RPG made by fighting game people
[2:02:24] <Louie_Salmon> Do combo
[2:02:27] <marvel877> Razmi's down move is your friend this early in the game.
[2:02:27] <+KingGoblodyte> Put your shield up!
[2:02:27] <%demegodz> BLOCK
[2:02:33] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @AngriestPat Remember Dhar's Down + Attack!
[2:02:33] <%PlagueOfGripes> stock with Dhar while you wait on Razmi to do big combo
[2:02:34] <+Grayhammatter> pat, do combo and block
[2:02:35] <%PauliusMaximus> hes a pre order/backer bonus
[2:02:37] <duffydirty> getting your ass beat by woolie's hulk doll
[2:02:40] <marvel877> PUT UP YOUR SHIELD
[2:02:41] <Pat_Squared> @couch_potato_Ed_Boy yeah. I'm even farther than that and they are still the best. Thorani so far has been the only other healer thus far and her heal is kinda situational
[2:02:44] <%Shadicara> F
[2:02:45] <arkv01> reminds me of the pseudo juggles in FFX2
[2:02:46] <%solidousstream> sigh well I gotta go and actually do work so I probably wont see the end of the stream -_- bye guys

[2:03:11] <%ThePuddingDead> get gud scrub
[2:03:11] <Tucker0603> ffs
[2:03:11] <tank7013> That's busted
[2:03:11] <%PlagueOfGripes> how embarrassing~
[2:03:11] <%cvp5127> lol
[2:03:12] <garbageheaphound> TEAM BLOCJ
[2:03:13] <%VanaSkiller> someone needs to tell Pat about the block mechanic
[2:03:13] <$SvenHolgersson> THANKS OBAMA
[2:03:14] <BlindGato> Team Block is important
[2:03:15] <%Yakobro> LUL
[2:03:15] <Monkeyweed21> Pat you need to hit them
[2:03:17] <+Pomer> @majindusto uh... well good news!
[2:03:17] <+JacknZack27> Team block
[2:03:18] <star_feline> That game over is so abrupt I hate it
[2:03:18] <blackbookalpha> damn, I thought Pat has playing the other game?
[2:03:21] <%CalderGaming> that explains it
[2:03:22] <%transporterthesequel> HE JUST UP BALLED
[2:03:23] <%chronotriggerhappy123> Pat you get more meter for juggles aka up attack
[2:03:24] <+Pachi3000> You do, but then you have to press it again if the attack is multi-hit
[2:03:24] <duffydirty> use your only strength
[2:03:25] <Louie_Salmon> For each hit yes
[2:03:26] <%AgentOrangeShoes> Sacrifice yourself for more training on the clock
[2:03:28] <%Cervarian> To parry multi-hits, it's a timed mash
[2:03:30] <+jkobe34> nah on multi hits mash
[2:03:30] <heartlesshealer> nah, it's parry per hit, otherwise it's normal guarding
[2:03:31] <%transporterthesequel> You Blanka Motherfucker
[2:03:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> @majindusto Not sure if trolling.
[2:03:34] <%ThePuddingDead> there ya go
[2:03:36] <inz0mbiac> multi hit, multi block
[2:03:39] <majindusto> I kno. lol
[2:03:41] <+Skyebaker> Use Dhar Stocks
[2:03:42] <inz0mbiac> or just hold for regular block
[2:03:42] <%Mendin> Burn Meter With Impunity
[2:03:43] <%skizzuto> use Dhar's super
[2:03:45] <%QueequegTheater> QueequegTheater subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! Oh man I ended up in a twitter spat with Richard "sweaty unwashed weebs" Lewis right now and he pulled a random anonymous r/kappa post about how SonicFox smells to prove I'm delusional. What the fuck is this week
[2:03:47] <+Skyebaker> he does no damage
[2:03:50] <Louie_Salmon> Mashing the block can get you far, kinda like Sekiro
[2:03:54] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[2:04:12] <Tytangamer> Try only using one pip for Razmi. She takes forever to regenerate the last pip.
[2:04:13] <blackbookalpha> Who's excited for Baz?
[2:04:13] <arkv01> @QueequegTheater stop empowering him with attention?
[2:04:14] <VJdarkworld> who da heck is richard lewis
[2:04:15] <%Svanyr> An attempt is made
[2:04:19] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @Pat_Squared Do you know how or the best way for Thorani to heal herself other than Lvl 3 Iddhi? I keep having trouble. LUL
[2:04:20] <+StrawberryPantsu> DID COMBO
[2:04:27] <%Gogogolem> building combo is important as well, so yo uwant to combo into supers
[2:04:28] <marvel877> Try Razmi's down move
[2:04:28] <joedatuous> use dhars super is rad
[2:04:28] <%QueequegTheater> @arkv01 but it's too much fun wasting his time
[2:04:30] <%Shadicara> Blanka ball is the ultimate combo Kappa
[2:04:33] <%Bt_Robot> Is there a hard turn system, or are you allowed to attack as soon as you are fully charged, like in FF7?
[2:04:37] <%demegodz> NICE
[2:04:37] <+jkobe34> thats why its by default not on a trigger
[2:04:37] <%Mendin> Probably Thorani co mboing 1-2 d.attack into u.attack?
[2:04:40] <%QueequegTheater> Also I'm trying to get him to block me and it's not working
[2:04:41] <%Deft_Thought> Remember, Razmi has a debuff built into her down attack
[2:04:41] <duffydirty> you mean it's weird to do the one thing you're especially good at? lol
[2:04:42] <KUYAmoPESh> It got a SF5 timing of ryu parry
[2:04:46] <%Kirby_Sauce> DHAR's meter is big number
[2:04:53] <garbageheaphound> WAIT DO DEAD PARTY MEMBERS GET XP?
[2:04:54] <+ZephynM> This game looks hard.
[2:04:59] <lotharrio> Stacking multiple slows on the big beef boys can help a lot.
[2:05:00] <Gutsandlove> yes
[2:05:01] <Calek> it's not hard
[2:05:02] <%SilvaChariot0133> Razmi's down-attack is a lifesaver
[2:05:03] <%ThePuddingDead> did he seriously change the controls!?
[2:05:05] <+boki_86> i love that Razmi is the US Voice of Sailor Moon Anime
[2:05:05] <WarchiefGoldva> Dhar's damage spikes furiously if you DA with him.
[2:05:05] <$MajorCrasher> LUL LUL
[2:05:07] <%ThePuddingDead> WHY
[2:05:08] <Fear_Ranjer> Yea and apparently the game doesn't shit itself when the main charcater dies too
[2:05:08] <suikudo> Its really not hard at all
[2:05:10] <%marsano168> You don't even need to wait until its fully charged you can attack as soon as you see a stock of the button reset
[2:05:13] <@commanderclaw> It's basically Royal Guard
[2:05:13] <heartlesshealer> It's active battle system, but your buttons turn into blocks when the enemy is attacking
[2:05:13] <Gutsandlove> you can parry before the battle begins
[2:05:18] <mercado94> LUL
[2:05:22] <narusao> cause of course pat remapped the controls
[2:05:23] <%ThePuddingDead> NO IT WONT
[2:05:26] <suikudo> No
[2:05:26] <duffydirty> NO
[2:05:27] <majindusto> NO
[2:05:29] <Pat_Squared> @couch_potato_Ed_Boy I think the intent is to use her 2 Bar super(ithink?) to make herself invulnerable instead of healing her, otherwise yeah its just her 3 bar
[2:05:30] <%VanaSkiller> trigger finger
[2:05:30] <garbageheaphound> NO
[2:05:30] <Tucker0603> no!
[2:05:31] <suikudo> NO
[2:05:31] <Monkeyweed21> NO
[2:05:32] <narusao> wait. hold on.... FailFish
[2:05:33] <Louie_Salmon> Whatever you're thinking, no
[2:05:33] <marvel877> NO
[2:05:34] <%ThePuddingDead> NO
[2:05:34] <UnfilteredComic> No???
[2:05:34] <+Pachi3000> Uh
[2:05:35] <ClairvoyantNara> Nooooooo
[2:05:36] <+HyperCharge_Sam> ?????
[2:05:36] <arkv01> big NEGATORY
[2:05:36] <mercado94> No
[2:05:36] <%PlagueOfGripes> nothing is easy
[2:05:37] <+Pachi3000> Why
[2:05:37] <DocMadfox> Why?
[2:05:38] <%logoth_> Stopn
[2:05:39] <+Grayhammatter> no?
[2:05:39] <Zombrocom> Why
[2:05:40] <%ThePuddingDead> NO YOU FOOL
[2:05:41] <heartlesshealer> carpal
[2:05:41] <Monkeyweed21> NO IT ISNT
[2:05:41] <%Metballs> why?
[2:05:42] <%logoth_> no
[2:05:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> overthinking
[2:05:42] <garbageheaphound> FOOL
[2:05:42] <%skizzuto> what's the difference?
[2:05:44] <Caidezes> ?????
[2:05:46] <+KingGoblodyte> WHY EXPLAIN
[2:05:48] <Calek> it doesn't matter?
[2:05:49] <Louie_Salmon> Uh, I guess?
[2:05:49] <majindusto> NO, NO, NO
[2:05:50] <%marsano168> no cuase its on the same side as the attacks
[2:05:50] <alrobot2014> is there a difference?
[2:05:50] <+SleazyShell> ??????
[2:05:50] <DigbyMayor> That’s for group parry
[2:05:51] <%Quigsies> How?
[2:05:51] <WarchiefGoldva> Why would it be? I dunno.
[2:05:51] <%Shadicara> apatGoblin apatGoblin
[2:05:52] <%Mendin> Pat your shield was on L1 in darksouls why
[2:05:53] <%drfaustisdead> never had an issue with it.
[2:05:55] <%ThePuddingDead> ...
[2:05:56] <garbageheaphound> look what fucking with the controls got you before
[2:05:56] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Apparently they really ARE making a League Fighting game. Thought it was going to be a new IP but footage on Twitter shows one of the heaviest boys in the game doing grapples
[2:05:57] <+JacknZack27> Whats the difference?
[2:05:58] <rubbishbinge> ew
[2:05:59] <Caidezes> Pat...
[2:05:59] <narusao> right hand is best hand ... this is truth
[2:06:00] <marvel877> MIND GOBLINS
[2:06:00] <%VanaSkiller> trigger fingerr
[2:06:00] <+Pachi3000> But using meter is super important in this game, so
[2:06:01] <NiktenKing> no?
[2:06:01] <duffydirty> ???
[2:06:01] <%SilvaChariot0133> :^)
[2:06:01] <%Albadabar> apatGoblin apatGoblin
[2:06:02] <+earthboy2k> what
[2:06:02] <%sirisvirus> only if your weak
[2:06:02] <%ThePuddingDead> if you're....right handed yes
[2:06:02] <%dekkitout> Are the Goblidites restless already?
[2:06:03] <%Rumbutt> but left hand is defense Pat
[2:06:04] <BlindGato> Right is the MURDER button
[2:06:04] <Monkeyweed21> That makes no sense Cumbo
[2:06:04] <+ZephynM> If you're right-handed yeah
[2:06:04] <%SilvaChariot0133> apatGoblin
[2:06:05] <+faithless_zealot> Why are you listening to normies, PAt?
[2:06:05] <+KingGoblodyte> MIND GOBLIN
[2:06:06] <+Pachi3000> Which do you want to prioritize
[2:06:06] <%Shadicara> It's true right hand is best
[2:06:06] <s_snowball> wouldnt it literally just be a preference thing
[2:06:06] <%LaughingCatt> Pat thats handist
[2:06:06] <+earthboy2k> ??????????
[2:06:07] <%Puhff> Not for everyone
[2:06:07] <alrobot2014> maybe yours is
[2:06:07] <VJdarkworld> easier on hitbox :)
[2:06:08] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> might as well put your shield in dark souls on right bumper
[2:06:09] <suikudo> he isnt gona make it
[2:06:09] <+DoggyT> I dun know, keep getting um confused.
[2:06:10] <narusao> left handed - evil
[2:06:10] <Louie_Salmon> It's not that much mashing, usually
[2:06:12] <%drfaustisdead> I can use my left hand just fine to press one button...
[2:06:13] <+SleazyShell> Begone Goblins
[2:06:14] <cassiecagedd> why does chat care about his button lay out
[2:06:14] <%PlagueOfGripes> you won't be using it as much though
[2:06:14] <%ThePuddingDead> what was that statement
[2:06:15] <lotharrio> Your right hand is going to be tired from doing sick combos.
[2:06:15] <ThirdPersonPhil> my hands are not broken like yours
[2:06:16] <$Chimeraelite> FALSE
[2:06:16] <valriot> wat
[2:06:17] <+nekodelic> it would be better
[2:06:17] <FoggyHunter> Mind Goblins
[2:06:17] <Theonlypegsus> How is that Mind goblins Chat.
[2:06:17] <%Bt_Robot> You want to block with your sword hand?
[2:06:18] <%skizzuto> oh yeah I forgot righties were dumb like that. left-handedness 4 lyfe
[2:06:18] <+JacknZack27> I mean I guess?
[2:06:19] <marvel877> Our normal, NON BABY HANDS are better, yes.
[2:06:19] <hntronium> Lefties are like Red Bars
[2:06:20] <+DoggyT> I jsut know one blocks one supers.
[2:06:21] <%TheMattman1313> yeah but most block/parry stuff uses LT/LB
[2:06:22] <%thegreatestbambe> ???
[2:06:22] <wookie5358> meter burn on the left hand would confuse me
[2:06:23] <%MakotoPB> use your left more often when Paige not around
[2:06:23] <%vaporousTippler> If it ain't right, it's wrong.
[2:06:23] <Fear_Ranjer> Oh my god Roti is adorable I love him
[2:06:24] <%Rumbutt> Put your shield on RB in Souls then
[2:06:24] <valriot> Right Handed Plebs
[2:06:24] <+Pachi3000> If you're right-handed NotLikeThis
[2:06:24] <garbageheaphound> WHOA
[2:06:25] <majindusto> I am left handed...and NO
[2:06:25] <+shatteredweasel> The old catholic ways
[2:06:26] <Fear_Ranjer> YOY
[2:06:27] <Ner234> Neat
[2:06:27] <caol2017> truth
[2:06:27] <+Grayhammatter> OH SHIT
[2:06:27] <Monkeyweed21> UP CUMBO
[2:06:28] <%skizzuto> YOOOO
[2:06:29] <%Ascethetic> im left handed you fuck
[2:06:29] <arkv01> "you look at your right hand and you're like I'm going to fuck this hand"
[2:06:29] <%ThePuddingDead> the fuck was that!?
[2:06:29] <heartlesshealer> you caaaan, if your index specifically is good for mashing
[2:06:30] <%thegreatestbambe> Alright I'm unsubbing for that one PAT
[2:06:31] <WarchiefGoldva> BIG COUNTER YEYEYEYE
[2:06:32] <+LastHazzerd> I'm left handed
[2:06:32] <%Puhff> doodDood doodDood
[2:06:33] <%tizz86> left shield, right sword
[2:06:33] <Pat_Squared> @couch_potato_Ed_Boy but yeah I think that she's supposed to be more of an off healer with more damage than ginseng
[2:06:33] <star_feline> :( left hand is under appreciated
[2:06:33] <%MelBrooksKA> @Puhff for everyone that matters spyCappa
[2:06:33] <segbas2004> oh shit you can do that lol
[2:06:35] <narusao> funfact: more than 50% of us presidents are left handed
[2:06:35] <Theonlypegsus> That legitimately makes sense
[2:06:35] <%thegreatestbambe> LEFTIE for LIFE
[2:06:37] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat LEFT HAND HOLDS THE SHIELD
[2:06:38] <marvel877> FINALLY
[2:06:40] <duffydirty> You're doing the thing
[2:06:43] <%Kiiper> I wish he would try Dhar's super
[2:06:43] <+DoggyT> CROSS COUNTER!
[2:06:46] <hntronium> If your hand is left, prepare for death
[2:06:47] <%TheQButton> TheQButton subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[2:06:48] <marvel877> LEFT HAND RULE!
[2:06:51] <dickbuttwoman> Yo gotta push that advantage when you get it. Getting a pre-emptive hit makes them all on the same row and you can juggle through their health
[2:06:53] <Louie_Salmon> Pls use Dhar's super, it will change your life
[2:06:54] <%PipIV> @skizzuto at least I dont smudge my writing
[2:06:54] <$Chimeraelite> tbh I like using Dhar's super the most. Hits like a goddamn truck
[2:06:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> Being left handed means you gonna suck the devil's dick if I remember my weeird catholic bumfuckery.
[2:06:56] <%Mendin> Try Dhar's meter
[2:07:04] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @Pat_Squared Well shit. And I've read that her Lvl 2 is better used after her Down+ATK cause she turns into a puddle right infront of the enemy that heals allies when they move over it to attack.
[2:07:06] <+JacknZack27> Yeah dhars super is super strong
[2:07:06] <+Pachi3000> When you get hit, you lose meter
[2:07:06] <%Shadicara> LUL
[2:07:07] <Ner234> LUL
[2:07:07] <UnfilteredComic> Blocking Drains meter also

[2:07:15] <heartlesshealer> yeah Pat, you switched the buttons :p
[2:07:15] <Kipss> what the fuck is that noise from sotn
[2:07:16] <DocMadfox> Why is he like this?
[2:07:17] <%Shadicara> Played yourself
[2:07:17] <narusao> professional gaming by professional gamer
[2:07:19] <%TheQButton> Imagine defending against attacks in the year 2019
[2:07:26] <+Pachi3000> Also, use Razmi's meter - it heals you
[2:07:27] <marvel877> That's what you get, Pat
[2:07:31] <amychibi> how come pat has roti around ajna ?
[2:07:39] <coracor> jesus
[2:07:40] <%demegodz> YOOO
[2:07:40] <%SilvaChariot0133> Slow stacks to x3 btw
[2:07:43] <%demegodz> Nice
[2:07:43] <%Kiiper> yeyeyeye
[2:07:44] <arkv01> meaty
[2:07:44] <UnfilteredComic> I Love that super
[2:07:44] <%Metballs> Low level Ajna is a way better healer than Razmi anyway. Just let Razmi die, get the res, and like a 60% heal
[2:07:45] <%Mendin> Roti DLC got fixed a day ago
[2:07:46] <Ner234> Bonk
[2:07:48] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Wait isn't Ginseng in the Party now?
[2:07:48] <%Shadicara> This is literally a fighting game
[2:07:50] <Fear_Ranjer> Razmi is great
[2:07:51] <KUYAmoPESh> Blocking consumes the Idhhi bar build up so watch out on blocking with the group or blocking all together.
[2:07:51] <Zombrocom> Rolling pin of doom
[2:07:53] <+Pachi3000> You can toggle him in the menu

[2:11:22] <arkv01> I mean you level up and shit
[2:11:22] <Jontman42> It's an RPG, like Zelda

[2:18:02] <lotharrio> That boosting healing is the most important thing.
[2:18:03] <%Shadicara> ALL HEAL ALL DAY
[2:18:04] <ItsAGundamu> ALWAYS BOOST HEALING
[2:18:04] <arkv01> you have consumed CHILD
[2:18:06] <heartlesshealer> So he builds stock too, but for healing
[2:18:07] <+Grayhammatter> you NEED to boost his healing
[2:18:07] <Coystick> I can't believe you ara'd that shita

[2:18:18] <+StrawberryPantsu> 1 METER
[2:18:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> 2 bars
[2:18:19] <%skizzuto> one super meter
[2:18:19] <%QueequegTheater> what the fuck
[2:18:19] <%lovebass4stuff> This is important @angriestpat
[2:18:20] <+Pachi3000> Eventually you will have more meter
[2:18:20] <dickbuttwoman> Meter man
[2:18:20] <garbageheaphound> your super bR
[2:18:20] <+faithless_zealot> 2?
[2:18:20] <arkv01> @Coystick Kreygasm
[2:18:20] <SleepyMaribo> your special meters pat!
[2:18:21] <DXLelouch24> YOUR METER
[2:18:22] <%tizz86> numbers are meter charges
[2:18:22] <%Rumbutt> 1 is one meter, 2 is 2 meter Pat
[2:18:22] <Monkeyweed21> 1 bar
[2:18:22] <mrshazboto> Numbers = Meter Burn
[2:18:23] <cassiecagedd> 1 super meter
[2:18:23] <%transporterthesequel> Then throw things I guess
[2:18:23] <+shatteredweasel> super bar
[2:18:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> for later
[2:18:24] <marvel877> METER
[2:18:24] <Caidezes> Pat...
[2:18:24] <+KingGoblodyte> ONE METER BAR
[2:18:25] <+Maleicus> god pat numbers mean bar
[2:18:27] <televisedrevolting> It's meter Patrick
[2:18:28] <cassiecagedd> its explained baddly
[2:18:28] <%Quigsies> METER
[2:18:28] <assfordayz> PAT, all things that can stack STACK MANY TIMES
[2:18:28] <%Shadicara> Pat will never use the heal guys Kappa
[2:18:29] <marvel877> 1 BAR
[2:18:31] <DXLelouch24> ONE SPECIAL METER BAR
[2:18:31] <+JacknZack27> 1 is one bar of meter
[2:18:32] <heartlesshealer> Numbers in place of buttons equates to meter
[2:18:32] <$spardanwarrior> 1 meter to search, down attack or two meter to throw
[2:18:32] <%drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat one or two meter bars.
[2:18:33] <%TheWinged7> rainbow icon + number is how many bars @AngriestPat
[2:18:33] <majindusto> Loli Shota
[2:18:33] <+LastHazzerd> meters like razmi heal
[2:18:35] <%ThePuddingDead> anybody finally beat this btw?
[2:18:35] <DigbyMayor> His level 1 super.
[2:18:35] <duffydirty> Would this be by default the best fighting game story mode there is?
[2:18:35] <%TheQButton> When it talks about 1 and 2 that is the stock for the super bar you need for that attack
[2:18:35] <ThDark> The same thing it meant last time it said ONE Pat
[2:18:36] <DocMadfox> Mota mota, don't vore the shota
[2:18:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you know, Pat, the rainbow meter shit.
[2:18:44] <%TheWinged7> agreed
[2:18:44] <cassiecagedd> its not good
[2:18:44] <%Shadicara> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[2:18:46] <JonEWorldbeater> Then learn how to read Fubkboivin
[2:18:46] <cassiecagedd> your right
[2:18:47] <arkv01> pat you gotta put chat on slow mode, this is going to kill you and us
[2:18:48] <+Pachi3000> I think it's kinda bad too
[2:18:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> I agree
[2:18:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> Pat
[2:18:50] <%ThePuddingDead> Oh! you think it's NOT GOOD huh?
[2:18:52] <%PlagueOfGripes> of what now
[2:18:52] <$SvenHolgersson> it could be worse
[2:18:52] <%Mendin> Don't disagree
[2:18:53] <Monkeyweed21> YOU PLAY FIGHTING GAMES CUMBO
[2:18:53] <UnfilteredComic> Its al rainbow, like the meter
[2:18:55] <Caidezes> It's pretty clear, Pat.
[2:18:56] <krymzen5> i do too
[2:18:57] <Louie_Salmon> The meter is a rainbow, that's fine
[2:18:57] <%TheWinged7> i had the same problem when i started
[2:18:57] <heartlesshealer> That's why the icon is rainbow colored at least, but yeah it's weird
[2:18:57] <mrshazboto> You're right and it's on the list of things they're fixing
[2:18:58] <%tizz86> pat has spent too much time with paige in the away time
[2:18:58] <Pat_Squared> you basically just keep mixing with ginseng and then just hold onto it until you need the big heal
[2:18:59] <%demegodz> Wow
[2:18:59] <ThirdPersonPhil> i think you need to play more fighting games
[2:18:59] <gameever> Wait, How do people see/heal the mind stands? Do they project themselves? I don't understand what they are then, I thought it was souls but now it just seems to be like weird stand things
[2:19:00] <DXLelouch24> THATS A YOU PROBLEM
[2:19:00] <%Big_Dream> 1 meter Bar
[2:19:01] <NiktenKing> nah... it's a rainbow bar
[2:19:01] <%ThePuddingDead> thats a YOU problem
[2:19:02] <%cylish> FIGHTING GAME THO
[2:19:02] <Cranky_Construct> You're right, but it's the only thing that's colored the same as the meter
[2:19:02] <marvel877> Pat will never heal because what if he ever has to use a meter later.
[2:19:02] <grayjammer> This game has really bad tutorials
[2:19:02] <joedatuous> thats stupid pat
[2:19:03] <%TheWinged7> 1
[2:19:04] <+Pachi3000> That's how Lab Zero be
[2:19:05] <%SilvaChariot0133> Use 1 Bar of Super NotLikeThis
[2:19:05] <+RootShaman> but it was rainbow
[2:19:05] <%bevyrage> (1) and (2) are your ultimates pat, the meter in the top left?
[2:19:06] <cassiecagedd> i had the same issue
[2:19:06] <+CSNG> The tutorials of the game as a whole are pretty hard to understand
[2:19:06] <$MajorCrasher> this isn't a moba
[2:19:07] <%Archmortal> Why do you think it's on the RAINBOW COLORS
[2:19:07] <%GunEden> this game is not good?
[2:19:08] <%Albadabar> I guess because it costs 1 bar of meter?
[2:19:08] <suikudo> thats a you thing
[2:19:08] <+KingGoblodyte> Yeah, it's bad
[2:19:08] <rubbishbinge> the 1 meter
[2:19:08] <Thirtine> nah man, its pretty clear
[2:19:09] <BigNerdSam> 11111111
[2:19:09] <%Metballs> It's not a MOBA
[2:19:09] <+StrawberryPantsu> I think of Tekken
[2:19:09] <%QueequegTheater> FIGHTING GAMES PAT
[2:19:09] <lotharrio> Ginseng's normal attack is a huge multiplier on their healing. Gotta use it two or three times before their up attack does a big heal.
[2:19:09] <%logoth_> Pat is right
[2:19:09] <duffydirty> yeah your overwatch meter
[2:19:10] <+aslfrasle> @AngriestPat 1 Means 1 bar of super
[2:19:10] <DocMadfox> Pat that's a you issue
[2:19:10] <joedatuous> its to clear pat
[2:19:10] <Fear_Ranjer> Yeeea it's a bit weird
[2:19:10] <%marsano168> they had to port it everywhere so you cant use specific face buttons
[2:19:11] <%Morbidmort> That's a Pat thing, not a game thing
[2:19:12] <%TheQButton> It's a marvel super.
[2:19:13] <+LastHazzerd> that's on you, pal
[2:19:13] <valriot> PC games are for fucking losing, get rekt scrubs
[2:19:14] <%blaccbird914> i can see that because I get mixed up all the time too
[2:19:14] <OBS_VinnieK> That is a you problem Pat.
[2:19:14] <%LaughingCatt> its rainbow like the meter
[2:19:14] <ThirdPersonPhil> you playing too much mobas
[2:19:15] <WoRabbit> yeah, your meter
[2:19:15] <wookie5358> in fighting games, using 1 would mean an attack
[2:19:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Stop playing trash mobile games Pat LUL
[2:19:16] <NiktenKing> it's a rainbow bar that looks like the meter...
[2:19:16] <suikudo> You and your dumb moba mind goblins
[2:19:17] <%Tearonex> Don't see it
[2:19:17] <%tizz86> to be fair, he's not wrong
[2:19:18] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Poor wording
[2:19:18] <marvel877> That's on you for playing on PC, Pat.
[2:19:19] <%Shadicara> It's super clear if you READ pat Kappa
[2:19:20] <%PlagueOfGripes> the rainbow 1 button? yeah, I was like 25% of the way through the game and had no clue what they were trying to say at the time
[2:19:21] <arkv01> stupid slutty cat!
[2:19:22] <+blitzrush1200> Its color coated as a meter Pat
[2:19:23] <BlindGato> It's also in RAINBOW
[2:19:23] <%Cn_alpha_02> Its fighting game meter.
[2:19:24] <+Pachi3000> LUL
[2:19:24] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> You mean like in Mortal Kombat and Tekken?
[2:19:24] <majindusto> PRESS "ANY" KEY
[2:19:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> I get the feeling this isn't a Pat game/
[2:19:26] <SGrim> @AngriestPat get good cumbo
[2:19:27] <joedatuous> that how fighting games be
[2:19:29] <$SvenHolgersson> How is that different from FF
[2:19:29] <BlindGato> and the meter is in RAINBOW
[2:19:29] <%SilvaChariot0133> Level 1 Super NotlikeThis
[2:19:30] <%ThePuddingDead> thats the meter ya putz
[2:19:31] <%demegodz> PRESS ANY KEY
[2:19:31] <rbakervv> their level 1 super
[2:19:34] <Monkeyweed21> FIGHTING GAMES PAT
[2:19:34] <+Pachi3000> You're not wrong, it confused the hell outta me
[2:19:34] <+StrawberryPantsu> Context Clues m8
[2:19:35] <UnfilteredComic> Hes gone
[2:19:35] <cassiecagedd> just say suuuperrrrr
[2:19:36] <heartlesshealer> rainbow 1, as in one of the rainbow meter
[2:19:36] <Tytangamer> Pat, It’s using fighting game inputs. That’s how fighting games tell you to use bar.
[2:19:36] <+aslfrasle> That sounds like a you problem
[2:19:36] <Fear_Ranjer> I DO agree it's pretty weird
[2:19:36] <ThirdPersonPhil> your bar is color coded to that
[2:19:37] <%SilvaChariot0133> PAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
[2:19:37] <coracor> GOOD
[2:19:38] <narusao> good kitty
[2:19:39] <%depressed_skeleton> Where is the Any key?!
[2:19:40] <dickbuttwoman> You have two things. The attack and the super. It's REAL clear pat
[2:19:40] <SeraphicCharlie> Yeah thats that fighting game shit
[2:19:40] <asmistake> oh wow, you're literally just starting
[2:19:41] <1matheuw> the baby
[2:19:41] <worldbrand> should just be use 1 and then an icon for the resource
[2:19:42] <+shatteredweasel> Best cat
[2:19:42] <+LastHazzerd> use 1 = use level 1 super
[2:19:44] <%Shadicara> This one button will break pat
[2:19:45] <duffydirty> revenge
[2:19:46] <Gerik1233> it should say the meter button
[2:19:47] <narusao> best. cat. ever.
[2:19:48] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat it's one bar pat, it's not that hard to understand
[2:19:48] <Pat_Squared> they could have said 1 iddhi meter to be fair
[2:19:48] <mrshazboto> The red bull belongs to elmo now
[2:19:49] <star_feline> He's just baby
[2:19:49] <arkv01> BAD CAT, red bull is more precious than blod
[2:19:49] <%dekkitout> Do you want ants?
[2:19:49] <Fear_Ranjer> The Baby being a rebel
[2:19:49] <%cherubs_anonymous> It's the same color as the meter and has a number next to it
[2:19:51] <+RootShaman> it should be 1M maybe
[2:19:51] <duffydirty> for waking him
[2:19:51] <heartlesshealer> Oh no it spilled!
[2:19:51] <%GabeSweetMan> Admittedly it took me a bit of time to figure out what the hell those prompts meant.
[2:19:52] <%Edgy_Macaroon> good work Elmo
[2:19:52] <asmistake> precious life sustaining red bull
[2:19:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotLikeThis
[2:19:53] <+Pachi3000> It's like Lab Zero expected that only Skull Girls fans would be playing this game
[2:19:53] <+FoolsArcade> I had no problem understanding what that meant when I played this game
[2:19:53] <%dekkitout> Cause this is how you get ants?
[2:19:53] <marvel877> Almost as if this was made for consoles first, Pat
[2:19:54] <%Mendin> Can't just say super because there's also (2) and (3) later
[2:19:55] <%Archmortal> This isn't hard, he's just old and blind.
[2:19:57] <Caidezes> Use one filled meter gauge. Not that complicated.
[2:19:57] <1matheuw> best emlo
[2:19:57] <SeraphicCharlie> You'll get used to it, but that doesnt make it good
[2:19:59] <%PlagueOfGripes> they also describe defending by using the "attack button" sometimes. some stuff in the game could be more clear
[2:19:59] <Pat_Squared> but that would've been more words
[2:20:00] <%demegodz> PAt will now hate this game all for this
[2:20:02] <Ner234> The wording is silly but it's nt THAT hard to understand
[2:20:04] <%ThePuddingDead> sure ya will
[2:20:04] <+DoggyT> Could be a lot cleaner diffently.
[2:20:05] <%SilvaChariot0133> and 4 and 5 Kappa
[2:20:05] <%WackyGear> elmo roars
[2:20:05] <+LastHazzerd> how do other fighting gmaes talk about leveled supers?
[2:20:06] <%Tearonex> nah, totally disagree with Pat there
[2:20:09] <heartlesshealer> it's fine Pat
[2:20:09] <+AWanderingKenku> 1 Meter? Game ruined. Pack it in, boys!
[2:20:10] <UnfilteredComic> F
[2:20:10] <%depressed_skeleton> pee break
[2:20:10] <%GabeSweetMan> DED
[2:20:11] <1matheuw> stream cancelled?
[2:20:11] <duffydirty> big taurine piss
[2:20:11] <%ThePuddingDead> Sup chat?
[2:20:11] <slim_shady2019> You get more meter later on
[2:20:12] <%Metballs> Metballs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 16 month streak! 
[2:20:13] <+coolthulhuu> a lot of characters have different supers depending on how much meter you burn so it still works
[2:20:13] <arkv01> pee out precious red bull
[2:20:14] <%Puhff> It should call it a Super at least.
[2:20:14] <Louie_Salmon> I guess? This feels like someone saying that a Magic card should say "Doesn't tap when attacking" instead of "vigilance", it's just more readable
[2:20:15] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[2:20:19] <%Shadicara> Elmo is playing now
[2:20:21] <%NopeBadguy> NopeBadguy subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Thanks for all the entertainment over the years again! Quick question, whatever happened to Baby Ashley?
[2:20:21] <Fear_Ranjer> Like yeah it's easy enough to understand but the wording and such looks really weird
[2:20:22] <+blitzrush1200> Elmo sabotage
[2:20:24] <asmistake> he ain't peeing, he's absorbing that spilled redbull
[2:20:28] <+alucard929> It's literally made to look like a full meter!
[2:20:28] <%GabeSweetMan> There's a LOT of rough edges in this game.
[2:20:29] <s_snowball> rest in peace elmo
[2:20:30] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @AngriestPat Hold RB/R1. The game is gonna be unclear with a bunch of things later on as well.
[2:20:30] <+Pachi3000> There's tons of shit in this game that isn't explained all that well
[2:20:31] <cassiecagedd> pat only has 1 super rn 2 makes no sense in his context
[2:20:35] <%mh9s> drinking that red bull off the floor
[2:20:38] <grayjammer> The nomenclature used makes sense, but isn't immediately intuitive.
[2:20:38] <%GabeSweetMan> I'm still enjoying it but it is admittedly very flawed.
[2:20:38] <%ThePuddingDead> he's prolly cleaning that floor with his tongue
[2:20:38] <marvel877> And Mike Z thinks having to run everywhere is totally fine and why do we need teleports...
[2:20:42] <duffydirty> kinda like skull girls
[2:20:46] <%Kiiper> Oh god, I was just rewatching the mailbags what DID happen the baby Ashley
[2:20:48] <duffydirty> didnt explain shit very well
[2:20:51] <+Pachi3000> That's about where I am with it. It's super flawed, but fun
[2:20:53] <duffydirty> until like...later
[2:20:55] <%Shadicara> Didn't want us seeing him sup the redbull from the floor
[2:20:55] <arkv01> there's no fast travel in this game?
[2:20:58] <+CSNG> This game really needs a defined movelist with required inputs
[2:21:03] <%Kiiper> SKullgirls had an incredible tutorial
[2:21:05] <Pat_Squared> I still have no idea if ajna's levels and the heart shit actually does anything
[2:21:06] <cassiecagedd> skull girls had a great tut idk what you mean
[2:21:09] <Fear_Ranjer> Is Pat absorbing the redbull?
[2:21:10] <%Kiiper> what are you talking about
[2:21:10] <+zzNamttamzz> he is beating elmo DarkMode
[2:21:24] <%Shadicara> Elmo would beat pat cmon Kappa
[2:21:26] <arkv01> he's making roasted feline pork chops D:
[2:21:33] <Louie_Salmon> A real-ass movelist would definitely be better, instead of this arbitrary summary that doesn't show you a bunch of good tech
[2:21:49] <star_feline> Pat would NEVER harm the baby BibleThump
[2:21:49] <%tizz86> @pat_squared from what I've gathered, hearts are affinity, multiply pwr.
[2:21:52] <marvel877> @arkv01 There is, but for like moving from this city to that city, but nothing that lets you teleport around inside each relatively big city.
[2:21:53] <joedatuous> peepoops time
[2:21:57] <NiktenKing> Pat is absorbing Red Bull faster than Ajna absorbs people
[2:22:01] <duffydirty> so everyone is forgetting the lack of movelist that had to be found on the website
[2:22:07] <%Metballs> Getting a full meter in training at least would be great
[2:22:08] <heartlesshealer> Welcome back
[2:22:09] <Fear_Ranjer> WATUP
[2:22:12] <%depressed_skeleton> can't prove it
[2:22:13] <%Shadicara> Supped it with a straw more like
[2:22:15] <%mh9s> can't waste that redbull
[2:22:16] <$SvenHolgersson> sucked it right out the carpet
[2:22:17] <%ThePuddingDead> meh, besides some UI shenanigans and a couple of goofy moments, this game was a very solid 7.5, im glad I backed it
[2:22:17] <star_feline> He licked all of it up
[2:22:18] <+DoggyT> NOw the Floor has Wings.
[2:22:20] <DXLelouch24> Pat the meter is a YOU PROBLEM, i totally understand it
[2:22:20] <%Metballs> So we can see everyone's different levels easier
[2:22:21] <+blitzrush1200> Absorbed*
[2:22:22] <%PipIV> sticky floors
[2:22:25] <+faithless_zealot> Elmo's trying to save your life, Pat
[2:22:26] <+Pachi3000> It also doesn't give you all of a character's abilities. Like, the game NEVER tells you that Razmi's 2- and 3-meter moves are fire attacks.
[2:22:27] <Superbro64> lol fighting game footage exists now @angriestpat
[2:22:30] <marvel877> Cleaned, or lapped it up?
[2:22:35] <$MajorCrasher> different level supers do different things though @angriestpat
[2:22:38] <+shatteredweasel> you trrbl
[2:22:38] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotIkeThis
[2:22:40] <WarchiefGoldva> What fucked me up the most was when I got a new party member that changed Ajna's lvl 2 super into a Rekka divekick, and the game didn't fucking tell me that it did that. I stumbled by accident on it.
[2:22:40] <COMB711> Ginseng's neutral attack is very good combo fill
[2:22:40] <coracor> true but why
[2:22:42] <%ThePuddingDead> shut up, too bad, you suck play game now
[2:22:43] <Pat_Squared> @tizz86 hmm ok that makes sense I guess. Wish there had been a place they had explained it
[2:22:44] <+Pachi3000> LUL
[2:22:46] <DXLelouch24> WRONG
[2:22:49] <+Real_Todd_Howard> Y'all hear about the league fighting game?
[2:22:51] <%SilvaChariot0133> -26
[2:22:52] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat The hearts pat
[2:22:53] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah he said some shit on the podcast
[2:22:53] <Zalthia> Elmo <3
[2:22:53] <UnfilteredComic> He was talking about the hearts
[2:22:54] <inz0mbiac> the others have affection level
[2:22:55] <cassiecagedd> woolie is in fact wrong
[2:22:55] <%Albadabar> His heal is a million times better than Razmi's by the way Pat
[2:22:55] <DXLelouch24> WRONG,WRONG,WRONG
[2:22:57] <%Mendin> The heart levels are Affinity Psuedo-Levels
[2:22:58] <%demegodz> -24 hearts to Dhar
[2:22:58] <+Grayhammatter> that's wrong
[2:22:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> *-24
[2:22:59] <mrshazboto> Hearts are levels
[2:22:59] <marvel877> 1
[2:22:59] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> "Next: "
[2:23:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the hearts are multipliers from what I understand.
[2:23:00] <%AgentOrangeShoes> GET WRONG WOOLIE
[2:23:01] <asmistake> i have no idea what that level does though
[2:23:02] <ThDark> Big wrong
[2:23:03] <%Binary_Fireball> what's the NEXT?
[2:23:03] <suikudo> You are so wrong
[2:23:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> The hearts are your relationship with the other nerds right
[2:23:04] <DigbyMayor> The heart is the level
[2:23:04] <+StrawberryPantsu> Woolie :Speaker of False Truths
[2:23:05] <DXLelouch24> AFFINITY IS LEVELS
[2:23:07] <Fear_Ranjer> The fact the others have AFFECTION instead of LEVELS feels SO WEIRD
[2:23:08] <joedatuous> hearts are not levels
[2:23:09] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @Pachi3000 THIS. The only way I found that out was AFTER I found the Training guy at the Port place.
[2:23:09] <Gutsandlove> the hearts count as levels
[2:23:10] <heartlesshealer> The affinity (hearts) levels are just how well they work together with Ajna
[2:23:10] <rubbishbinge> Level of LOVE
[2:23:10] <Calek> I can't believe Dhar is level -24
[2:23:12] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat S-links are their levels
[2:23:12] <$SvenHolgersson> so is 4 Woolie's wrong?
[2:23:13] <foreverN2dust> "Next"
[2:23:13] <+LastHazzerd> he never said that i thought
[2:23:13] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Don't ever trust a hipster when it comes to entertainment.
[2:23:13] <%Metballs> Woolie doesn't know what he's talking about? I'm shocked..>SHOCKED
[2:23:14] <%PauliusMaximus> the hearts arent levles
[2:23:14] <Aydarkzero> woolie the liar
[2:23:15] <heartlesshealer> it's baby social links
[2:23:16] <wookie5358> they do have a next level amount
[2:23:17] <+Pachi3000> I don't get the hearts thing
[2:23:18] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat Affinty is the level for others
[2:23:20] <Pat_Squared> but her level is still a mystery?
[2:23:20] <%PlagueOfGripes> tall temple is tall
[2:23:21] <+JacknZack27> They have heart levels instead of normal levels
[2:23:21] <%tizz86> @pat_squared the odd thing is, once you do certain things, some characters have a gold ring around the heart
[2:23:22] <Gutsandlove> but not on power
[2:23:24] <+TheSaintJohn> "Pat Jumps to Conclusions"
[2:23:28] <asmistake> roti is good
[2:23:28] <amychibi> how much you like razmi pat?
[2:23:30] <valriot> Yeah my biggest gripe is that character movesets stay the same the entire game @angriestpat
[2:23:31] <1matheuw> hes woolie the liar for a reason
[2:23:31] <Fear_Ranjer> Like Dhar is -24 but he's on equal terms with Ajna????
[2:23:31] <%honeyman18> move honey to the back
[2:23:31] <cassiecagedd> the heart doest mean anything from what i can tell and i 100% the game
[2:23:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> -24 <3
[2:23:35] <Gutsandlove> more like afinity towards ajna
[2:23:35] <%GabeSweetMan> My favorite character is later in the mid-game. Nuna is AMAZING. Her ability to interrupt enemies with traps is super OP. I just wish more of the encounters were designed with those kinds of interruptions in mind on both sides.
[2:23:40] <%Shadicara> Big secrets
[2:23:42] <%bevyrage> @AngriestPat look at the bottom right of each of their portraits
[2:23:42] <%Shadicara> Slide pat

[2:23:43] <+Grayhammatter> BIG secrets PogChamp
[2:23:45] <ミュウレ4242> no need to force it. razmi can speak for herself.

[2:24:04] <%ThePuddingDead> @PlagueOfGripes in a sewer of all places
[2:24:07] <DXLelouch24> the higher affinity with Ajna they have, the stronger they are, Dhars an asshole so he starts with negative affinity, have to build it up
[2:24:08] <Louie_Salmon> Congrats, nothing
[2:24:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> Really tbf levels are a meme here anyway
[2:24:09] <heartlesshealer> But hey! Now that thing's on your map for later
[2:24:09] <marklarphd> Remember how bad Valkyrie Profile platforming was?

[2:24:39] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 Pat, I get you're playing up the "BUT WHERE'S BABA!?" for us here, but this is a little ridiculous. But yeah, you don't need Razmi's "one" now that you have ginseg. That and Dhar's meters will smack shit with a big number.
[2:24:41] <star_feline> Again LUL
[2:24:41] <%Kirby_Sauce> reward A Cheer shared Rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[2:24:41] <brothandelus> The number next to the heart represents their affinity with Ajna, and that number increasing is essentially the same as a level up.
[2:24:44] <+Pachi3000> Now you can throw it with down B
[2:24:45] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:24:46] <%ThePuddingDead> LUL
[2:24:46] <%GabeSweetMan> He's stocking.
[2:24:47] <$MajorCrasher> LUL
[2:24:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> Why is your healer at the front.
[2:24:49] <cassiecagedd> down attack now
[2:24:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> uh-oh
[2:24:49] <redsynod> Honey no don't go in front
[2:24:51] <foreverN2dust> Does party position matter?
[2:24:53] <+zalonar> now hit down B
[2:24:53] <heartlesshealer> You stocked his DOWN+Attack
[2:24:55] <%walternatorz> physical healer chemist
[2:24:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> That seems like a bad decision
[2:24:56] <asmistake> now you can tthrow that with down-Ginger
[2:24:57] <$SvenHolgersson> can't wait for Ajna to fuck Dhar
[2:24:58] <%GabeSweetMan> Character positions barely matter.
[2:24:58] <DXLelouch24> NO PAT, LAUNCH IT THEN DO COMBO
[2:25:00] <arkv01> ajna using the child as a meat shield WutFace
[2:25:00] <+Pachi3000> Only Up B works on this guy
[2:25:01] <CoffeeKaiju> you can mash as ginseng
[2:25:01] <dickbuttwoman> Switch your healer to back
[2:25:05] <heartlesshealer> neutral stocks his healing
[2:25:05] <$SvenHolgersson> and have a hatefuck baby
[2:25:06] <%Metballs> Only for left and right as some attacks hit in a line
[2:25:07] <%PauliusMaximus> party postion doesnt matter
[2:25:08] <%GabeSweetMan> UP ^
[2:25:14] <%PauliusMaximus> it just matches the controller
[2:25:14] <grayjammer> Party positions only really matter for certain types of attack.
[2:25:17] <mrshazboto> Ginsing is for building combo with their neutral and healing with their up. The only other "good" skill is their 3 meter burn special
[2:25:18] <%Gogogolem> You want to attakc then heal with her
[2:25:19] <DracaenaLeaf> Look at that big 1 up there
[2:25:22] <%Shadicara> Damage
[2:25:23] <UnfilteredComic> Damage

[2:25:27] <arkv01> yeah but its not a good look if put the kid in the front
[2:25:27] <%GabeSweetMan> Down
[2:25:28] <+Pachi3000> It gets you a thing that you can throw
[2:25:29] <%Kirby_Sauce> Oh my god
[2:25:29] <%TheQButton> It throws the item
[2:25:29] <dickbuttwoman> It's a random upgrade to damage
[2:25:29] <%SilvaChariot0133> Down attack
[2:25:30] <cassiecagedd> if you down attack she throw
[2:25:30] <joedatuous> do it pat

[2:25:32] <asmistake> do ginger's down attack
[2:25:32] <%chronotriggerhappy123> you have to JUGGLE

[2:25:33] <BigNerdSam> DOWN B
[2:25:35] <+zalonar> damage
[2:25:35] <asmistake> ginseng, i mean
[2:25:35] <Coystick> Why is your healer shota in the frontrow?
[2:25:36] <ECRead> down b
[2:25:36] <SoySocks> stockpiles a projectile attack
[2:25:37] <grayjammer> Stocks up the Down-B
[2:25:38] <+Pachi3000> Ginseng's down attack throws shit from his backpack
[2:25:39] <marvel877> Powers up his Down move
[2:25:40] <+LastHazzerd> you read it,
[2:25:41] <joedatuous> just play the game dummy
[2:25:42] <Sokumotanaka> why would you put the healer upfront to take the most damage??
[2:25:42] <%ThePuddingDead> if u read the ui instead of bitching about it ya'd know ya dingdong
[2:25:43] <coracor> YEET
[2:25:44] <$MajorCrasher> maybe read the character abilities
[2:25:46] <xIgnitionCrowx> Hinsing in the front where he belongs.
[2:25:47] <%PlagueOfGripes> What does what
[2:25:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> YEET
[2:25:49] <asmistake> you done it
[2:25:50] <+Grayhammatter> YEET
[2:25:52] <UnfilteredComic> Read the thing
[2:25:53] <garbageheaphound> for damage
[2:25:53] <lotharrio> It loads him up with a stronger down-b attack.
[2:25:54] <%luftraumm1> lvup
[2:25:55] <%demegodz> YEET
[2:25:55] <+JacknZack27> You throw the item you pocketed with down attack
[2:25:55] <Gutsandlove> yup
[2:25:58] <$Big_King_Coconut> they get weirder
[2:25:59] <rubbishbinge> stonks go up
[2:25:59] <%chronotriggerhappy123> up attacks with dhar and down attacks with ajna
[2:26:00] <DXLelouch24> OH IT GETS MUCH WIERDER
[2:26:00] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Not really
[2:26:00] <%Kirby_Sauce> You read it
[2:26:03] <+Pachi3000> Except the game never explains them in full
[2:26:03] <DigbyMayor> It makes his down B stronger
[2:26:10] <asmistake> his neutral attack powers up his heal
[2:26:10] <+Pachi3000> No
[2:26:11] <%luftraumm1> also party formation?
[2:26:12] <%Ragin_Asian06> So its Teddie from P4A
[2:26:13] <Thorn14> cirOwO
[2:26:14] <+HyperCharge_Sam> OR
[2:26:15] <%Mendin> the down-b already exists
[2:26:16] <%Metballs> No
[2:26:16] <%demegodz> OR
[2:26:17] <%Albadabar> Ginseng is really easy if you just mash b until you need a heal, then he heals for like 3 billion
[2:26:17] <%TheWinged7> no
[2:26:17] <dickbuttwoman> BIGGER things
[2:26:17] <%Kirby_Sauce> No
[2:26:17] <%PauliusMaximus> you dont need to
[2:26:17] <%PlagueOfGripes> you use it first and then use Down Attack
[2:26:18] <%moogleboy1984> Never use Ginseng & Honey for damage honestly
[2:26:18] <star_feline> OR
[2:26:18] <+Pachi3000> It just gives you.........more things
[2:26:18] <%tizz86> no
[2:26:19] <cassiecagedd> not always
[2:26:19] <%honeyman18> plz arrange your party, they need to be tanks up front
[2:26:19] <+CSNG> It makes the down attack better
[2:26:20] <UnfilteredComic> It makes your next throw stronger
[2:26:20] <Ner234> Why are you over complicating this?
[2:26:20] <$SvenHolgersson> down attack or meter
[2:26:21] <DXLelouch24> luckily theres a training room later to figure this shit out
[2:26:21] <%akaAxi0m> It's Faust
[2:26:21] <heartlesshealer> Not NEED, just throw something better
[2:26:22] <marvel877> NO
[2:26:22] <%TheWinged7> it gets you a STRONGER down b
[2:26:22] <prime_name> no
[2:26:23] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> ...Lord...
[2:26:23] <tank7013> No, to throw BETTER something
[2:26:23] <Caidezes> PAT
[2:26:24] <%Shadicara> No you need to use super to stock then down B to throw
[2:26:24] <%PauliusMaximus> it's just more powerful
[2:26:24] <Louie_Salmon> You could just not
[2:26:24] <%Kirby_Sauce> Just throw bigger
[2:26:26] <Thorn14> PAT
[2:26:26] <televisedrevolting> No you find a thing.
[2:26:26] <%demegodz> fucking OR
[2:26:26] <cassiecagedd> its a much stronger thing
[2:26:26] <%sirisvirus> no just something bigger
[2:26:27] <+Pachi3000> It makes the next throw more powerful
[2:26:28] <%dekkitout> Ginny yeets things?
[2:26:28] <%AgniBrandt> Nah, super powers up your throw
[2:26:28] <lotharrio> The basic throw attack is there, but weak. If you stock up a bigger one, it's a stronger attack.
[2:26:29] <Thorn14> THROW BIGGER
[2:26:29] <+DoggyT> You gain a Better Damaging Item when you use the DOwn Attack.
[2:26:29] <DigbyMayor> It makes it stronger
[2:26:30] <%GabeSweetMan> It powers up the Down B. It's not the best use of your meter.
[2:26:30] <%tizz86> it says "OR"
[2:26:30] <%demegodz> READ
[2:26:30] <Fear_Ranjer> I'm guessing (1) is just big damage??
[2:26:30] <mrshazboto> Legit the only important thing about Ginsing is his neutral to build combo, his up to heal, and his 3 meter special does big damage
[2:26:30] <COMB711> no, it just makes it better
[2:26:31] <banananutcake> "bigger" Pat
[2:26:32] <BigNerdSam> USE YOUR SUPER, PAT
[2:26:33] <%Metballs> Pat, read the description
[2:26:34] <rubbishbinge> It's Mind Charge
[2:26:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> @AngriestPat To say nothing of the fact that Ajna gets command strings that the game doesn't tell you about
[2:26:34] <$SvenHolgersson> READ THE OR
[2:26:36] <%PlagueOfGripes> chat too fast
[2:26:37] <CoffeeKaiju> pat you can also mash ginsengs basic attack for more hits
[2:26:40] <+LastHazzerd> this is why training is needed
[2:26:44] <+Pachi3000> But you can actually do it any timew
[2:26:45] <%Shadicara> Yes
[2:26:46] <%ThePuddingDead> yep
[2:26:46] <dickbuttwoman> BIGGER items
[2:26:46] <%moogleboy1984> just use her neutral attack to build up the heal
[2:26:47] <Monkeyweed21> it buffs your next down attack
[2:26:48] <+JacknZack27> You can throw something anyway. Its just does more damage
[2:26:48] <%demegodz> Yes
[2:26:49] <%Kirby_Sauce> 1 improves down
[2:26:49] <$MajorCrasher> bigger
[2:26:49] <%tizz86> OR
[2:26:49] <+CSNG> This game REALLY needs a movelist
[2:26:50] <%GabeSweetMan> The descriptions are NOT GREAT
[2:26:50] <Ner234> Yeah
[2:26:50] <Thorn14> BIGGER. ITEMS.
[2:26:51] <arkv01> fuckin chat LUL
[2:26:52] <cassiecagedd> you always have small item
[2:26:52] <%Big_Dream> or 2 meter
[2:26:53] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah a movelist would be ideal
[2:26:53] <+Pachi3000> Yeah...
[2:26:54] <+StrawberryPantsu> It's a buff
[2:26:54] <DXLelouch24> PAT 1 is THE SAME COLOR AS YOUR IDDHI METER
[2:26:54] <majindusto> "their"
[2:26:54] <lotharrio> Bigger than WHAT, Pat?
[2:26:54] <%ThePuddingDead> what about that is difficult?
[2:26:55] <UnfilteredComic> Because their down attack throws items?
[2:26:55] <ScreamLord> OR 2!
[2:26:56] <%AgniBrandt> Your down attack throws an iitem. Your super makes that item stronger
[2:26:56] <+LastHazzerd> cuz these explinations are too short
[2:26:57] <This_is_Marco> chat thinking they're helping LUL
[2:26:57] <+DoggyT> You get better throwing items, but it's random what you get.
[2:26:58] <DracaenaLeaf> BLIND
[2:26:59] <$MajorCrasher> LUL
[2:26:59] <Coystick> PAT
[2:26:59] <lotharrio> Bigger than WHAT?!
[2:27:01] <heartlesshealer> Think these as arcade cabinet move lists that are never full
[2:27:01] <televisedrevolting> And?
[2:27:01] <+StrawberryPantsu> BIGGER ITEM
[2:27:02] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Chat's fuckin retarded
[2:27:03] <dickbuttwoman> BIGGER. items.
[2:27:03] <Coystick> PAAT
[2:27:03] <DigbyMayor> BIGGER
[2:27:03] <+AWanderingKenku> Down + Attack throws
[2:27:04] <%Albadabar> Once you get more meter Pat
[2:27:05] <+KingGoblodyte> YUP
[2:27:06] <asmistake> you don't have to use it first
[2:27:06] <1matheuw> chat is totally wrong here
[2:27:06] <star_feline> I'm assuming ( 2 ) is a more powerful version of Down ATK
[2:27:06] <+JacknZack27> Not every move is listed
[2:27:06] <+Pachi3000> I know, but it's not that simple
[2:27:07] <BigNerdSam> What's so hard to understand about that?
[2:27:07] <%tizz86> OR 2 meter you fuck
[2:27:07] <joylent_blue> chat it IS unclear don't be assholes
[2:27:07] <%AgniBrandt> The wording is terrible
[2:27:07] <brothandelus> You throw small stuff if you don't use the special.
[2:27:08] <joedatuous> search then down for more damage
[2:27:08] <televisedrevolting> No?
[2:27:09] <Fear_Ranjer> YEA THAT'S WEIRD
[2:27:09] <%Albadabar> It'll do more stuff
[2:27:09] <%moogleboy1984> search for BIGGER items
[2:27:09] <%Kirby_Sauce> @AngriestPat 1 IMPROVES down
[2:27:09] <%PlagueOfGripes> I can't think of a situation where you'd use this over using another character's better Super
[2:27:09] <+DoggyT> It's not clear enough but it jsut gives better down attack damage.
[2:27:09] <NiktenKing> BIGGER
[2:27:10] <%marsano168> the meter just powers up the down attack
[2:27:10] <%Big_Dream> Bigger items
[2:27:13] <asmistake> you just get a baby throw if you don't charge it
[2:27:13] <%TheWinged7> apatBig ger
[2:27:13] <simulationbard> Read it better tho Kappa
[2:27:14] <Tucker0603> FOR BIGGER
[2:27:14] <Thorn14> it BUFFS THE DOWN B
[2:27:14] <+Pachi3000> This game doesn't list all the moves
[2:27:15] <marvel877> 1
[2:27:15] <+FoolsArcade> Pat you are not an english major
[2:27:16] <+Pachi3000> Because fuckit
[2:27:17] <OBS_VinnieK> BIGGER ITems, normal Down attack throws normal items
[2:27:17] <NiktenKing> BIGGER ITEMS
[2:27:18] <marvel877> 1111111
[2:27:19] <banananutcake> "bigger" which implies that there's something that's not as big
[2:27:19] <suikudo> good god its not that hard
[2:27:20] <Sapphire_Breeze> this is stupid
[2:27:22] <1matheuw> it needs better wording
[2:27:23] <Zombrocom> That could be worded better, ima be real
[2:27:24] <televisedrevolting> Patrick it's not that complicated.
[2:27:24] <+Pachi3000> THERE DOES
[2:27:24] <%TheWinged7> use ginsengs super for more damage on down attack
[2:27:24] <%moogleboy1984> It's an install for a single move
[2:27:24] <%Big_Dream> s1 meter big items
[2:27:25] <WarchiefGoldva> Bigger item implies smaller item!
[2:27:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> So this is definitely a bad stream game/
[2:27:26] <%bevyrage> @AngriestPat installs and buffs like that persist between fights too
[2:27:26] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @AngriestPat The descriptions are not great. Don't worry about it. Just experiement with everything.
[2:27:27] <+skm742> @AngriestPat Character movesets only explain special properties, not the base moves
[2:27:27] <marvel877> MIND GOBLINS
[2:27:28] <chambatron> The super gives your a bigger item so your down A does more damage maybe?
[2:27:28] <lotharrio> Agreed.
[2:27:29] <+Pachi3000> IT IS
[2:27:29] <duffydirty> Yeah, no, you guys are forgetting that skull girls had a similar problem as this. When the game didn't originally come with a command list and it needed to be found on its website.
[2:27:30] <Monkeyweed21> Why is pat so bad at this game
[2:27:30] <%PauliusMaximus> you're right it does say that but you can down attack wayways, get used to those character sheets being confusing as fuck
[2:27:32] <JonEWorldbeater> Illiterate asshole blames writing for his inability to read
[2:27:33] <mrshazboto> They're working on it
[2:27:33] <%ThePuddingDead> YOU need a complete move list
[2:27:33] <DXLelouch24> Game expects you to figure it out later in training area
[2:27:33] <Thorn14> NotLikeThis
[2:27:33] <UnfilteredComic> They have 3 moves
[2:27:34] <dickbuttwoman> It really isn't.
[2:27:35] <Brother_Coduss> ONE. BAR. PAT
[2:27:35] <%Metballs> You're transferring super into stockpiled damage buff
[2:27:35] <%Kirby_Sauce> It's really not
[2:27:36] <%TheQButton> I know how works but I am like 2 glass of white wine to deep to explain it.
[2:27:37] <%smoe79> Pat Complains At Indivisible
[2:27:37] <%CthulhuCommando> just try every button in the combat
[2:27:38] <arkv01> "Yeah pat its not that hard just fucking do it you dingdong"
[2:27:39] <%AgentOrangeShoes> Directions unclear, getting smashed by mobs
[2:27:39] <+Pachi3000> He's not wrong, it's super confusing
[2:27:39] <+StrawberryPantsu> Bad wording? Yes. Not that hard to understand though.
[2:27:39] <Aydarkzero> wait is it just wrong?
[2:27:40] <+AWanderingKenku> "Bigger" items
[2:27:40] <Ner234> No it isn't
[2:27:43] <Fear_Ranjer> Who cares if it says it buffs Down + B when it implies Down + B doesn't work without (1)
[2:27:44] <slim_shady2019> You don’t have to
[2:27:44] <Caidezes> How is it unclear? Damn it Pat.
[2:27:45] <Pat_Squared> getting the item is literally only for extending combos since its a down attack
[2:27:45] <Zalthia> The game needs to have better explanations
[2:27:45] <+LastHazzerd> this game is written for people who hate menus and "downtime"
[2:27:47] <Monkeyweed21> You're REALLY bad at this game
[2:27:47] <+Pachi3000> PogChamp
[2:27:48] <marvel877> Mike Z apparently thinks it isnt
[2:27:49] <%GabeSweetMan> Just because you understand it chat doesn't mean it's clear to everyone.
[2:27:52] <DXLelouch24> THERES A TRAINING AREA LATER PAT
[2:27:53] <%TheQButton> YOOOOOoooo
[2:27:54] <star_feline> PogChamp MERKED
[2:27:57] <Louie_Salmon> Yo, nailed it
[2:27:58] <asmistake> durian time
[2:27:59] <wookie5358> if this was real life, ajna would definitely get her dick stuck in ceiling fan
[2:28:00] <DXLelouch24> JUST LAB IT
[2:28:00] <heartlesshealer> Yeah look at that!
[2:28:00] <%TheQButton> That was wild!
[2:28:01] <%AgniBrandt> I would frankly appreciate a full movelist
[2:28:02] <slim_shady2019> You get bigger items that cause more damage
[2:28:03] <%ThePuddingDead> god just like Paige
[2:28:03] <%AgentOrangeShoes> HE DONE IT
[2:28:04] <%dalmek> The fact that chat is divided means the wording is unclear
[2:28:05] <%jobbedbone> just understand it pat.
[2:28:08] <+Grayhammatter> BIG combo
[2:28:08] <+StrawberryPantsu> DID COMBO
[2:28:09] <joedatuous> yeah its pretty simple when you calm ur shit stupid
[2:28:09] <slim_shady2019> Same tbh
[2:28:10] <+CSNG> Another confusing thing is some characters have three supers, some have one super, some have no supers. And it doesn't tell you
[2:28:10] <Pat_Squared> but you can just use their neutral attack instead
[2:28:13] <This_is_Marco> Now there's two monkaS
[2:28:13] <Brother_Coduss> It says one bar blind man!
[2:28:14] <Fear_Ranjer> THEY NEED MOVELISTS
[2:28:15] <dickbuttwoman> Pat, when you get a first strike PRESS the advantage! You hit both on all attacks
[2:28:16] <%Basch71> just know it 4Head
[2:28:16] <star_feline> GOOD COMBO
[2:28:16] <%moogleboy1984> it's like Dhar's Down Attack, but it burns a meter
[2:28:20] <+Pachi3000> Pat's right, the wording is confusing and not fully documented well
[2:28:20] <asmistake> i'm surprised you don't got your fightstick out for this
[2:28:20] <%moogleboy1984> it's pretty garbo
[2:28:23] <$Big_King_Coconut> how dare you not instantly grasp every mechanic in this game Kappa
[2:28:26] <%ThePuddingDead> complains for several moments of something, then when he do it, its a simple "oh ok"
[2:28:31] <%PlagueOfGripes> I had this problem with the demo and it remains in the base game. A lot of the moves don't seem to make a lot of sense, and their design intentions are vague
[2:28:32] <%Mendin> There we go
[2:28:33] <Louie_Salmon> Yup
[2:28:34] <joedatuous> they literally have two moves..
[2:28:36] <1matheuw> thats a mountain wheel
[2:28:36] <%GabeSweetMan> Dahr is a good boy.
[2:28:37] <lotharrio> Dhar's special is generally better than Ajna's.
[2:28:39] <%Kirby_Sauce> That's what i was trying to tell you!
[2:28:40] <Monkeyweed21> Fuck Dhar but hes really good
[2:28:41] <Zalthia> Ginsings 2 is really good
[2:28:41] <rubbishbinge> Can the party positions be changed? Having Ginseng in front is giving me anxiety
[2:28:42] <+blitzrush1200> good aoe
[2:28:49] <mrshazboto> Ajna's down attack does max deeps
[2:28:50] <%LaughingCatt> now your gettin in the rhythm
[2:28:50] <%tizz86> will we see the sand worm tonight?
[2:28:52] <%Mendin> They can, yes, Rubbish
[2:28:54] <Pat_Squared> apparently they're already talking about working on a full movelist so thats good
[2:28:55] <+Pachi3000> Chat, party position really does not matter
[2:28:56] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat you hate Dhar less now
[2:28:57] <arkv01> "fuck that guy who killed my dad, but he's got an amazing dick"
[2:28:58] <%marsano168> You are getting pat
[2:28:59] <$SvenHolgersson> Its just Paper Mario with extra steps
[2:28:59] <heartlesshealer> Actually using Ginseng properly in regards to healing <3
[2:29:00] <DXLelouch24> Dhar gets big chararacter development
[2:29:00] <deadbeat34> You
[2:29:01] <heartlesshealer> finally
[2:29:06] <%GabeSweetMan> AJNA now hates Dhar a little less!
[2:29:06] <zv1neda> dhar has buldge
[2:29:08] <Zalthia> Probably not. First have to get through the mountain
[2:29:08] <marvel877> Look, level go up, Pat
[2:29:09] <rubbishbinge> yaaay
[2:29:09] <tank7013> @Pat_Squared Thank god
[2:29:09] <%Cervarian> @tizz86 Ha. Good one. LUL
[2:29:10] <%PauliusMaximus> they expect you to try random stuff instead of taking everything at face value
[2:29:10] <ミュウレ4242> tizz86, no. he walks without rhythem.
[2:29:14] <$SvenHolgersson> I hate Dhar more cuz hes good
[2:29:14] <+Pachi3000> Dhar is POWER stacker
[2:29:14] <Monkeyweed21> @Pachi3000 Party position matters for some characters
[2:29:14] <lotharrio> @rubbishbinge Yes, but for it to matter much, you gotta adjust party positioning in the option menu.
[2:29:16] <Blackscience91> Seems like they wanted people to play around with each character. so kept things vague. Risky gamble.
[2:29:18] <%Metballs> Position only matters for one specfific type of attack in specific situations
[2:29:19] <star_feline> Heart should go down with Dhar not UP
[2:29:20] <%Big_Dream> i cant stand ginseng animation
[2:29:20] <Coystick> Stop lusting after Dhar dong
[2:29:21] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Dhar is still a Carth tho
[2:29:23] <%SilvaChariot0133> :^)
[2:29:24] <krymzen5> i love healer girls moveset
[2:29:25] <%ThePuddingDead> you're making it more difficult
[2:29:25] <Louie_Salmon> @joedatuous They all have 3, plus their super, plus ginseng has this weird property that isn't explained
[2:29:25] <Caidezes> OLD
[2:29:25] <grayjammer> @rubbishbinge Yes but it doesn't matter. Ginseng is not in any extra danger for being in front.
[2:29:26] <asmistake> there's an option to change whether your arrangeent is static or if it switches depending on what direction you face
[2:29:27] <+StrawberryPantsu> Play on stick :^)
[2:29:28] <This_is_Marco> youll get it eventually, I mean you just started
[2:29:29] <Monkeyweed21> You're just really bad
[2:29:32] <marvel877> For you, yeah.
[2:29:32] <+Pachi3000> @Monkeyweed21 It matters a LITTLE but not much
[2:29:33] <Zombrocom> Why do we hate knock off virgil?
[2:29:35] <%tizz86> @mule4242 that fight infuriated me for a bit lol
[2:29:35] <%GabeSweetMan> Difficult in the early game. Hoping they fix the difficulty sooner rather than later.
[2:29:36] <Tytangamer> Oh god, Pat, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet.
[2:29:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> That because Pat ismt am epic gamer
[2:29:37] <SoySocks> remember you don't need to hold a direction while walljumping
[2:29:37] <This_is_Marco> goddam chat
[2:29:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> same here, but it's still fun and I feel like I'm getting better.
[2:29:41] <1matheuw> delicious rorbs
[2:29:42] <mankeyfigh> WOOLIE IS CRUSHING this game
[2:29:43] <cassiecagedd> I mean i guess
[2:29:46] <%Animorphimagi> Dont direct wall jumps!
[2:29:47] <coracor> FeelsBadMan
[2:29:51] <%Mendin> @Zombrocom He literally killed our dad 10min into the game
[2:29:52] <asmistake> i missed so many bafmodads
[2:29:52] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Fuck your home, spiders!
[2:29:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> Have you considered getting gud? 4Head
[2:29:53] <deadbeat34> You can combo into Ginsengs heal
[2:29:54] <rubbishbinge> its ok
[2:29:56] <UnfilteredComic> YOuve only been playing for an hour, it will just take time
[2:29:59] <gordieda20> FeelsBadMan
[2:30:01] <adjothetiger> @AngriestPat don't worry pat you'll get the hang of it
[2:30:02] <DXLelouch24> get ready chat, is gonna get wiereder soon, and Pats gonna freak out
[2:30:03] <+Pachi3000> To be fair, you usually need to wait until you have at least two buttons
[2:30:04] <krymzen5> wasted meter
[2:30:05] <%depressed_skeleton> FortHype
[2:30:06] <%TheQButton> You'll get the hang of it. I believe in you.
[2:30:06] <amychibi> patt you have a dash movement somebody tell him
[2:30:07] <%lovebass4stuff> I’m bad too
[2:30:07] <ItsAGundamu> games not hard just bad, people litterally complaining game is too easy and Mike Z said ok we'll fix it
[2:30:07] <Zombrocom> Damn. Why is he in her head then?
[2:30:07] <%transporterthesequel> No chat is dumb save attacks for COMBO
[2:30:08] <%PlagueOfGripes> Maybe.
[2:30:08] <worldbrand> i figure you will get used to it
[2:30:09] <%SilvaChariot0133> yes, but also no
[2:30:09] <asmistake> ginseng's heal also starts a juggle
[2:30:09] <+Pachi3000> You can also combo between characters
[2:30:09] <Louie_Salmon> Yes, saving for a big combo is good
[2:30:11] <cassiecagedd> air combo build bar
[2:30:11] <+StrawberryPantsu> Yes
[2:30:12] <This_is_Marco> combo looks cool so yea id think
[2:30:12] <+skm742> Do combo good.
[2:30:13] <%Kirby_Sauce> You can dash before jump for distance
[2:30:13] <krymzen5> combo builds meter
[2:30:13] <NiktenKing> yes... but you arent
[2:30:14] <+zalonar> yeah, do combo
[2:30:14] <%Animorphimagi> No
[2:30:15] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Don't listen its better to combo into super for more damage
[2:30:16] <COMB711> Ginseng is good to send out first, their attack does a lot of hits and gets you to higher combo damage with the rest of the squad
[2:30:16] <%SilvaChariot0133> less time for enemy to attack the better
[2:30:18] <ty7erzer0> yes
[2:30:19] <coracor> monkaS
[2:30:20] <valriot> @angriestpat Juggle combos gain more Super
[2:30:21] <%Metballs> You don't have enough to get good combo
[2:30:21] <joylent_blue> chat is being booli FeelsBadMan
[2:30:21] <%marsano168> its a trade off, if you just block good everything is all good
[2:30:21] <ThirdPersonPhil> but do they stop regaining their stock if they attack?
[2:30:22] <%LaughingCatt> combo is also mitigation due to juggling
[2:30:23] <%dekkitout> I sense spooder boss
[2:30:24] <arkv01> yes... lab 0
[2:30:25] <Tytangamer> It’s way better to combo. There’s a noticeable difference in damage.
[2:30:25] <amychibi> somebody tell patt he has a dash that helps hi jump better
[2:30:25] <+TheParadoxPrototype> Combo's better! Help you generate more meter. You'll get loads more options as you continue along, Pat.
[2:30:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> dey runnin
[2:30:25] <%Cervarian> @AngriestPat People will yell at you, but it IS okay to wait for everyone's actions to be full
[2:30:26] <Louie_Salmon> There's a middle ground, you're doing pretty good actually
[2:30:27] <cassiecagedd> combo good if you juggle
[2:30:28] <$SvenHolgersson> SUPERBEAST LORD
[2:30:29] <joylent_blue> BEAST LORD
[2:30:30] <Pat_Squared> it definitely feels like most of what they want you to do is just figure it out on your own but that gets frustrating sometimes
[2:30:30] <wookie5358> waiting for both attacks means downtime wasted that could be spent attacking
[2:30:30] <%GabeSweetMan> BEAST LORD
[2:30:30] <marvel877> You can combo and still use meter, Pat.
[2:30:30] <sheepysenka> BEAST LORD
[2:30:30] <DigbyMayor> Just don’t wait for Razmi because she’s slow
[2:30:30] <Fear_Ranjer> SPODER?!
[2:30:30] <heartlesshealer> Pat may still be learning, but at least he learned healing. I was almost screaming at Woolie's video
[2:30:31] <coracor> BEAST LORD
[2:30:32] <+Pachi3000> LORDS OF BEAST
[2:30:32] <NiktenKing> you are combing slowly tho
[2:30:34] <%dekkitout> Supa Beest!
[2:30:35] <arkv01> NIER?
[2:30:36] <heavenlygunner> @AngriestPat Do really big combo, and number go up. Number go way up.
[2:30:37] <lotharrio> Bigger combos give more super-meter, and deal more damage. But you gotta get them out, and if you get people dying left and right, then it's a wash.
[2:30:37] <%GabeSweetMan> SPIDER BEAST LORDS
[2:30:38] <mrshazboto> Dear Dr. Pat - How was your week off? I feel like people are shitting on you for no reason. Also - it's WAY more efficient to wait for everyone to have full bar, but that's more important later when you have a higher number of attacks.
[2:30:38] <%Animorphimagi> No cumbo
[2:30:39] <3dbee> pinda express
[2:30:39] <+TheParadoxPrototype> meter spending gets easier as you advance through the story.
[2:30:39] <cassiecagedd> BEAST LORD
[2:30:41] <Zombrocom> Sounds metal

[2:30:45] <garbageheaphound> THATS RAD
[2:30:45] <sheepysenka> Beast lord is a princess, dumbss
[2:30:45] <%ThePuddingDead> its best to understand what each dpad motion does with what character, get a nice chain combo going, THEN u get meter
[2:30:45] <%Morbidmort> The One Reborn?
[2:30:47] <Ner234> Metal af
[2:30:48] <suikudo> he is so fucked
[2:30:48] <+Pachi3000> It's not as cool as they make it sound

[2:31:33] <asmistake> razmi is the absolute best
[2:31:36] <%TheQButton> That scared the shit out of me!
[2:31:36] <%LaughingCatt> ITS GOT ARMS
[2:31:38] <%Shadicara> Is that a fucking crossbow on it's ass??
[2:31:39] <+skm742> nobody's AP goes up while someone's attacking, monsters included, so saying that you should mash attack to make monsters attack less is dumb.
[2:31:39] <joedatuous> it has a fucking bow
[2:31:40] <Fear_Ranjer> This thing is AWESEOME
[2:31:44] <This_is_Marco> look at it wait through the dialogue LUL
[2:31:45] <Coystick> Does it have a crossbow on its back?
[2:31:48] <televisedrevolting> Thoss are arms, holy shit why
[2:31:49] <%GabeSweetMan> One of the best fights in the game IMO.
[2:31:50] <asmistake> give me Razmi's Adventure DLC
[2:31:50] <%TheWinged7> Razmi best girl
[2:31:51] <arkv01> YEEET Razmi
[2:31:52] <Coystick> OKAY BOW
[2:31:53] <+ZephynM> She's heckin' edgy
[2:31:53] <valriot> LUL LUL LUL
[2:31:54] <$SvenHolgersson> I wish Razmi would set me on fire :(
[2:31:55] <heartlesshealer> oh right poison
[2:31:56] <+Pachi3000> I mean, you can also pause
[2:31:58] <%Shadicara> SPIDER CENTAUR
[2:31:58] <%demegodz> DID A MAN COME OUT
[2:32:01] <+Arkfyre> My parts 😡
[2:32:01] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Thank you Razmi, burn it for us all.
[2:32:04] <doggieo> This feels like Little Witch Acadamia to me
[2:32:07] <+Pachi3000> It's better for Ginseng to be healing
[2:32:07] <worldbrand> oh no razmi's my type oh god oh jeez

[2:32:21] <ClairvoyantNara> coeMort
[2:32:21] <%GabeSweetMan> This is a TOUGH early boss.
[2:32:22] <%dekkitout> @worldbrand You feelin' it too monkaS
[2:32:24] <star_feline> Push the coward button
[2:32:25] <%arcaderabbit48> That's a headless buff dude in there
[2:32:26] <mrshazboto> Also - perfect timing your block is IMPORTANT
[2:32:28] <%ThePuddingDead> turns out u cant heal a downed character....hmmmm
[2:32:35] <arkv01> @doggieo yeah basically sucy
[2:32:35] <Coystick> That's a cool design
[2:32:38] <%GabeSweetMan> Oh wow he actually noticed that. I missed that prompt a BUNCH early on.
[2:32:41] <garbageheaphound> holy shit razmi has like no health
[2:32:41] <%TheWinged7> use Razmis down attack to slow it
[2:32:42] <heartlesshealer> yeah, that revive is totally SoTN sound. Nice
[2:32:44] <%marsano168> Until you get used to the system boss fights take some doin
[2:32:46] <%GarbageNirvana> Is the framerate getting crusty or is that just the stream?
[2:32:46] <Fear_Ranjer> NICE JUGGLES
[2:32:47] <%moogleboy1984> you can build like, 4 stakcs of G&H's heal
[2:32:48] <+blitzrush1200> literally a way better heal and revives
[2:32:48] <%SilvaChariot0133> Slow lytNOTIKETHIS
[2:32:50] <%theAncopro> YEYEYE
[2:32:50] <krymzen5> nice combo
[2:32:51] <Finchit> Riot games announces fighting game.
[2:32:52] <asmistake> that RB-LB heal is what lets you have all attackers without a dedicated healer
[2:32:53] <+Grayhammatter> the juggles!
[2:32:53] <%tizz86> @gabesweetman not if he actually used Razmis debuff
[2:32:57] <+zalonar> good combo
[2:32:59] <%ThePuddingDead> there ya go
[2:33:03] <$SvenHolgersson> PIERCING
[2:33:08] <+Pachi3000> @GarbageNirvana The framerate gets a little crust while focusing
[2:33:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yay poison
[2:33:10] <%GabeSweetMan> Razmi's debuff is indeed incredible.
[2:33:10] <wookie5358> crazy talk
[2:33:12] <UnfilteredComic> Use meter
[2:33:16] <%smoe79> good combo~
[2:33:19] <+LastHazzerd> nice nice
[2:33:22] <%Mendin> I mean he's learning do combo, so progress
[2:33:24] <%GarbageNirvana> He's out of focus tho
[2:33:25] <asmistake> man, having only 1 meter kinda sucks
[2:33:25] <lotharrio> Ginseng builds up healing-power the more they use their basic attack. Three charges will do like... 5 times the healing.
[2:33:27] <$SvenHolgersson> OH THATS COOL
[2:33:30] <asmistake> fight ain't over yet!

[2:34:09] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 since dhar's stocks and group meter keeps between fights, you should build those up at the end of a fight so you can start strong on the next one. Also: use razmi's down attack to slow down bosses. Very useful.

[2:34:54] <mrshazboto> Guys you're legit being dicks to pat for no reason. Even more so than usual
[2:34:54] <+3InchMensch> With Ginseng around, did Pat just forget about Rezmi's super?
[2:34:57] <Swish19XX> Pat isn't doing great and you idiots aren't helping by screaming at him
[2:35:01] <asmistake> it's gonna take your parts!

[2:35:07] <UnfilteredComic> You gotta end those combos with meter, will make big damage
[2:35:08] <BigNerdSam> @benjifg The enemy attach stage changes the attack buttons to block buttons
[2:35:08] <%moogleboy1984> Pat, use Ginseng's regular attack to build up charges of her heal
[2:35:10] <gordieda20> Jeez chat
[2:35:13] <asmistake> pat's not doing too bad
[2:35:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Let Pat fail on his own here.

[2:35:24] <%arcaderabbit48> Its all the irritating RPG players in chat, plus all the irritating fighting game players! ITs the worst of both worlds screaming at Pat! Yaaaaaay!

[2:35:36] <$SvenHolgersson> FUCK IT UP
[2:35:42] <heartlesshealer> Pat doesn't really know how much Ginseng's healing stacks, so he just boosts once then immediately heals
[2:35:45] <Zalthia> God this chat is so negative
[2:35:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, agreed. I was quite relieved when I saw the focus feature.
[2:35:49] <Zombrocom> Yeah, a bit more chill in the chat would be nice
[2:35:50] <asmistake> well, you didn't get spiderstomped to critical health this time
[2:35:52] <%GabeSweetMan> It's ALWAYS better to dodge early.
[2:35:53] <Tytangamer> Pat, use Ajnas down attack after a launch. It’s her best combo.
[2:35:53] <heartlesshealer> still alright for early game
[2:35:54] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat try out Razmi's down attack on the boss (hint hint)
[2:35:57] <blackorchidKI2> I'm just here for the ride.
[2:35:57] <%SilvaChariot0133> Razmi's down-b applies a stacking slow that really helps for stuff like this
[2:35:58] <+blitzrush1200> take you're time if you need it
[2:36:09] <%Mendin> Wow he really likes Ginseng's EX
[2:36:09] <%GabeSweetMan> Parry timing is TIGHT
[2:36:09] <%marsano168> Hey he's doing better than i did on my first attempt
[2:36:11] <%californaya> can you Focus while they're attacking to make parrying easier?
[2:36:17] <%GabeSweetMan> I got WRECKT on my first attempt.
[2:36:23] <fatally_furious> @californaya nope, wheres the fun in that

[2:38:26] <+DoggyT> Technially Ginsing can only stack 3 heals.
[2:38:27] <%tizz86> yes
[2:38:27] <krymzen5> yea it stacks
[2:38:29] <mrshazboto> Combo increases damage and healing of all your move
[2:38:30] <+LastHazzerd> yup
[2:38:32] <Monkeyweed21> yea it stacks
[2:38:39] <+DoggyT> After the THird, no more stacking, but you don't loose the charge.
[2:38:40] <UnfilteredComic> Idk how many it stacks, you can tell by the green particles @AngriestPat
[2:38:41] <asmistake> the more Ginseng glows, the more heal he gots
[2:38:42] <Fear_Ranjer> EMLO
[2:38:42] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, Gensing's healing storage is measured by his green mist
[2:38:42] <+blitzrush1200> I like Dhar but it's too funny not to dunk on him
[2:38:42] <$MajorCrasher> ginseng glows green when healing is maxed

[2:44:24] <%SilvaChariot0133> ATTACK
[2:44:27] <%GrayMatterMiner> i return, from homework
[2:44:29] <%floralkami> @RushUnplugged Dhar killed your dad.
[2:44:34] <%GrayMatterMiner> what i miss
[2:44:38] <Sapphire_Breeze> "more murder"
[2:44:44] <%GabeSweetMan> I do wish their dialogue in the village updated more often.
[2:44:46] <asmistake> i like her head
[2:44:48] <arkv01> chat, you CANT fuck the guy who killed your dad
[2:44:51] <+Pachi3000> This lets you attack three times now
[2:44:52] <%SolverCODO> This "chatting music" is annoying
[2:44:52] <arkv01> you just CANT
[2:44:53] <%floralkami> @RushUnplugged not trying to listen to the dad murderer
[2:44:58] <wookie5358> why does dhar haave only one shoulderpad? what happens if someone swings for the other shoulder?
[2:44:59] <heartlesshealer> Pat has unlocked more buttons!
[2:45:00] <$SvenHolgersson> NUMBER GO UP
[2:45:01] <+Pachi3000> You'll now have three attacks per character
[2:45:07] <%GabeSweetMan> The next atk upgrade is a WAAAAYS off.
[2:45:13] <$SvenHolgersson> Defense? psh thats for sucker
[2:45:13] <%Shadicara> Now you can do big combo
[2:45:15] <asmistake> that shoulder should be pointed at the enemy
[2:45:16] <suikudo> Do hella combo
[2:45:18] <%RushUnplugged> @floralkami I know. Imagine if characters had progression instead of being stereotypes.
[2:45:19] <%GabeSweetMan> BIG DO COMBO
[2:45:19] <@lewdskeletor13> Everytime Dhar is on screen we should remind him that he killed our dad
[2:45:21] <QueequegTheater> Hey did Pat read donations/subs from tonight yet? I had to do a thing
[2:45:22] <mrshazboto> It's worth it to save up and max attack first IMO
[2:45:22] <Fear_Ranjer> I guess Defence makes you drain less meter when you guard?
[2:45:28] <%afronooch> afronooch subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[2:45:31] <%GabeSweetMan> Do apatBig combo
[2:45:31] <lotharrio> Visions of Paige trying to play.

[2:45:35] <1matheuw> !uptime
[2:45:36] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 45m.
[2:45:37] <+temporal_zenith> @wookie5358 Then he loses his arm and calls himself Dhar Vader
[2:45:39] <%ThePuddingDead> defense gives u more iddhi when parrying
[2:45:42] <%PlagueOfGripes> ye
[2:45:42] <+DoggyT> Think Defense will jsut give 'MORE' Meter instead of Less burn.

[2:47:02] <%tizz86> Zebie's a bitch imo #unpopular opinion
[2:47:03] <majindusto> Mcree
[2:47:03] <lotharrio> @Louie_Salmon His up attack is great, and he builds combos nice and steady with minimal need for timing.
[2:47:06] <arkv01> getting tired of that dhar dick, get in zebei
[2:47:07] <$SvenHolgersson> FUCK DHAR HES THE OHYA OF THIS GAME
[2:47:09] <%GrayMatterMiner> i like this guy

[2:47:12] <%Aeoneth> DID HE JUST HEAR THEM?
[2:47:13] <asmistake> dhar's attack buff is pretty nice
[2:47:15] <%TheMattman1313> Funfact: Razmi's VA also voices Kyrie from DMC, Orihime from Bleach, and Hinata from Naruto
[2:47:16] <%SolverCODO> Shit who is this voice actor?
[2:47:17] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Oh God, I just realized, this is just Tumblr's Headmates: The Game.
[2:47:18] <+Pachi3000> NO U
[2:47:18] <%XzileGaming> i really wish theyd stop saying RAVANNAVAR
[2:47:20] <%ThePuddingDead> he's not tho
[2:47:22] <%Kirby_Sauce> DHAR is the best!
[2:47:24] <simulationbard> Why can he hear them
[2:47:26] <asmistake> Bananabar!
[2:47:26] <%Morbidmort> LIAR
[2:47:26] <%dekkitout> Dhar: "No u"
[2:47:30] <+LTKonnor> @XzileGaming Ravannavar Kappa
[2:47:30] <blackorchidKI2> We're all criminals now.
[2:47:30] <garbageheaphound> Dhar is great
[2:47:34] <@lewdskeletor13> YOU KILLED MY DAD YOU FUCK
[2:47:35] <1matheuw> your face is a criminal dhar

[2:47:36] <Neo_Kaiser> Ew, don't bring up Tumblr.
[2:47:36] <%GrayMatterMiner> this is gonna be such a let down
[2:47:37] <arkv01> ajna is JUST zero from drakengard 3
[2:47:39] <@lewdskeletor13> STFU
[2:47:39] <arkv01> expands her harem
[2:47:42] <%demegodz> BIG LIAR
[2:47:44] <%floralkami> @TheMattman1313 she got real tired of being typecasted, huh....
[2:47:45] <wookie5358> knowing the face of the VA kind of kills immersion. I can't unsee that long brown hair
[2:47:45] <WarchiefGoldva> I don't think Zebei is a good party member. He's cool, but I never seem to be able to use him properly.
[2:47:46] <%Aeoneth> why can Zebei hear the others?
[2:47:47] <%PlagueOfGripes> I am here to kill the demons.
[2:47:48] <joedatuous> is Dhar an earthbender?
[2:47:53] <mrgrimsmiles> matt mercer doing some nice voice acting again
[2:47:53] <%cvp5127> vore you later

[2:47:59] <Flarepulse> You can't commit crimes from within the Head Prison

[2:48:02] <%GabeSweetMan> Pat.
[2:48:02] <duffydirty> shes super good
[2:48:03] <%demegodz> @AngriestPat You're just on the Leviathan
[2:48:04] <%ThePuddingDead> they're not permanently inside her head at all times

[2:48:08] <%moogleboy1984> Ajna is such a lovable idiot
[2:48:08] <Fear_Ranjer> NICE
[2:48:08] <coracor> BIG 30 damage
[2:48:09] <asmistake> nooooice!
[2:48:10] <arkv01> SSJ blue Kreygasm
[2:48:10] <star_feline> PogChamp FIRST TRY
[2:48:10] <%bread_assassin> Where's that cool kamen rider guy.
[2:48:11] <fatally_furious> was it really
[2:48:12] <dickbuttwoman> Pat, when that happens ATTACK
[2:48:12] <gordieda20> WORTH
[2:48:13] <simulationbard> First Time
[2:48:13] <+RogueMinja> Was it though?
[2:48:14] <%TheQButton> apatHoldon apatHoldon apatHoldon
[2:48:15] <%Kirby_Sauce> WHY
[2:48:15] <@lewdskeletor13> god I hate Dhar so much reeee
[2:48:18] <ScreamLord> OUMMMMMMMMMMMMM
[2:48:19] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> This guy's pretty confident!
[2:48:22] <%SolverCODO> Oh that voice actor is Matt Mercer, of course
[2:48:25] <heartlesshealer> So you come in full health when you land that, cool!
[2:48:26] <%Kirby_Sauce> you had full health
[2:48:27] <%SilvaChariot0133> So Ajna's down-attack is kinda nuts :^)
[2:48:27] <simulationbard> Why is Dhar fighting his own dudes
[2:48:27] <%transporterthesequel> Remember to charge Dhar's shitty shit
[2:48:30] <blackorchidKI2> @wookie5358 Those luscious, brunette locks.
[2:48:31] <asmistake> i didn't know you could block on the adventure screen for the longest time
[2:48:35] <%Mendin> Yeah start of fight before the enemies spread out into position lets you do Big Combo
[2:48:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> as for why there are books in a dumb person's brain...I think its cuz each area the characters inhabit in her brain are representative of their personalities.
[2:48:42] <arkv01> @lewdskeletor13 yeah the whole dadkilling bit is really harshing the mellow on this journey
[2:48:44] <asmistake> then I learned you can parry into battles?! how awesome
[2:48:45] <lotharrio> @Aeoneth The game is a little lazy so they didn't animate it, but it's assumed that the party members aren't ALWAYS inside her brain, especially when she's talking to people.
[2:48:48] <$SvenHolgersson> Ginseng fucking rules
[2:48:55] <cassiecagedd> ^
[2:48:56] <majindusto> Its Mccree / Jotaro
[2:49:01] <%moogleboy1984> with Ajna: Go Up, Down Down
[2:49:03] <mrshazboto> IMPORTANT TIP - there are several changes in Ajna's moveset throughout the game. Her down string will become the most important combo you have
[2:49:04] <arkv01> some of this aesthetic reminds me of BoF4
[2:49:04] <suikudo> its because you have 3 attacks now
[2:49:06] <asmistake> McRataro.
[2:49:06] <$SvenHolgersson> You got an extra move duder
[2:49:07] <tetrabrick1lt> big win
[2:49:11] <arkv01> probably the music
[2:49:12] <$SvenHolgersson> Attack go UP
[2:49:13] <garbageheaphound> WAIT
[2:49:13] <%Metballs> Ajna's axe is multi-swing per charge
[2:49:15] <garbageheaphound> GO BACK
[2:49:15] <%Kirby_Sauce> here we go
[2:49:18] <COMB711> Her down attack double axe is incredible
[2:49:19] <%Kirby_Sauce> go back
[2:49:20] <%Metballs> It's super cool
[2:49:20] <%GabeSweetMan> @Mendin Yes, this is the dominant strategy in every fight. ALWAYS spam them at the start of the fight so you can do apatBig Combo before they move away from the center.
[2:49:20] <+superkeaton> BACK
[2:49:20] <%crimsonharvest> are you really not going to save
[2:49:23] <%Mendin> Woolie did the same thing
[2:49:23] <cassiecagedd> no you go the good ay
[2:49:23] <+Pachi3000> This is progress, but you miss a bit of dialogue
[2:49:24] <%Kirby_Sauce> back
[2:49:25] <blackbookalpha> no its the right way
[2:49:28] <Monkeyweed21> thats progress
[2:49:29] <$SvenHolgersson> saves are for cowards
[2:49:33] <DXLelouch24> Ajnas combos change every time she gets new shit
[2:49:33] <Fear_Ranjer> The screen getting a blue border is the people being in her head I think
[2:49:33] <+desfore> @AngriestPat Ajna's attack strings change, I think depending on what attack is first?
[2:49:35] <Louie_Salmon> Definitely go forward first
[2:49:40] <%GabeSweetMan> Go to the right for dialogue.
[2:49:41] <%Kirby_Sauce> RIGHT
[2:49:41] <blackbookalpha> you'll get ass blasted
[2:49:44] <$SvenHolgersson> HAHAHAH
[2:49:45] <Fear_Ranjer> If the border isn't there then they're out of her head

[2:51:09] <%Shadicara> HUGE CUMBOS
[2:51:12] <cassiecagedd> Pats getting good at combo
[2:51:15] <blackbookalpha> was that a Durian?!

[2:51:22] <blackbookalpha> Ginseng just chucked a Durian
[2:51:24] <mrshazboto> Ginsing's [1] really isn't worth using TBH
[2:51:27] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> @tizz86 You're not wrong!

[2:51:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> those white dressed dudes be summoning soldiers
[2:51:40] <tetrabrick1lt> cool game
[2:51:40] <foreverN2dust> getting better
[2:51:41] <%ThePuddingDead> ye iknow
[2:51:43] <COMB711> It's SO good
[2:51:43] <Fear_Ranjer> It's good damage if you don't need burst healing from Razmi
[2:51:43] <%SilvaChariot0133> It's a bit busted
[2:51:44] <$SvenHolgersson> its a DBFZ 2H
[2:51:44] <asmistake> Ajna's the only character I can reliably get the up attack/down attack armor break off with
[2:51:47] <blackbookalpha> stinky Durian
[2:51:49] <WarchiefGoldva> Ajna's down attack is incredible.
[2:51:49] <%GabeSweetMan> There's a difference between liking a character for their utility and liking a character for their... uh... characteristics.
[2:51:50] <%PlagueOfGripes> all the cgaracters' down attacks are typically the 'best' ones
[2:51:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> prioratize
[2:51:51] <mrshazboto> Yes. it is. It is THE ONLY STRING you're gonna want to use
[2:51:51] <gridib> @AngriestPat dont forget aabout Dhar's super. It's unblockable just like Anja's
[2:51:52] <%floralkami> @mrshazboto it powers up the heal and keeps combo going
[2:51:56] <%Kirby_Sauce> you don'thave to wait for them to finish to have someone else move
[2:51:56] <%QueequegTheater> That's a "Goku Black on launch" level uppercut
[2:51:58] <Tytangamer> I was only trying to scream it at you for a whole ten minutes.
[2:52:08] <$SvenHolgersson> Yea but then Dhar gets more play and fuuuuuuuuuuuuck that
[2:52:12] <Fear_Ranjer> HAH

[2:54:34] <arkv01> enjoy your stay in voreland!
[2:54:36] <lotharrio> Zebei is fast AF, and you should consider swapping your party around fairly often. There's only like three characters I don't use.
[2:54:37] <%QueequegTheater> I GUESS I'LL PLAY IT
[2:54:37] <%GrayMatterMiner> i love how new members like, suckerpunch ajna with their soul
[2:54:37] <tetrabrick1lt> COOL GRANDMA

[2:54:40] <$SvenHolgersson> YEA DHAR SHUT IT
[2:54:44] <%TheQButton> It sounds very painful when she gets a new party member.
[2:54:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, his arrows are kinda important for now, but fuck him out of principle.
[2:54:45] <Louie_Salmon> It sure is does

[2:55:10] <CherrieVelvet> bye dhar
[2:55:10] <%californaya> Is absorption the same as vore?
[2:55:12] <$Big_King_Coconut> his down is a launcher, ajna's up is a launcher. that's not confusing at all
[2:55:13] <suikudo> Did you just replace Dhar with mufuggin Zebei!?
[2:55:14] <%TomDanksEGOT> THERES ANOTHER OPTIONAL PARTY MEMBER ON THIS FORTRESS YOU SHOULD DEF GET

[2:55:46] <%ThePuddingDead> yep, it IS a bow
[2:55:47] <Louie_Salmon> This thing is OP
[2:55:49] <+aslfrasle> "quiver" in fear...
[2:55:49] <EuropanLamprey> He really is Usopp. When do the lies begin?
[2:55:49] <duffydirty> fuck that security bitch up
[2:55:52] <heartlesshealer> love the arrow hit effect
[2:55:53] <KZN02> You can still get that party member in a later area if you miss him
[2:55:56] <COMB711> jump and arrow pat

[2:55:57] <%Kirby_Sauce> @cassiecagedd how dare you make me want to watch the woolie playthrough more
[2:55:58] <%GabeSweetMan> @amychibi Don't worry we'll spam when we approach that party member. WHO IS ALSO SUPER GOOD FOR THE NEXT BOSS.
[2:55:58] <fatally_furious> lets be honest, Tungar isnt really hard to miss
[2:55:59] <amychibi> THERES ANOTHER OPTIONAL PARTY MEMBER ON THIS FORTRESS YOU SHOULD DEF GET!!
[2:56:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> also, if you don't get this missible party member, you miss out another elsewhere
[2:56:02] <+alucard929> You've got options now.
[2:56:03] <%ThePuddingDead> too bad it is, enjoy it
[2:56:04] <%FalseEyeD> OoooooOOOOOoooo
[2:56:05] <ScreamLord> *Tim Alan noise*

[2:56:10] <UncleAndross_> fwip
[2:56:11] <%Ragin_Asian06> Btw, Zebei is Matt Mercer
[2:56:12] <lennyrager> Check themap
[2:56:13] <$SvenHolgersson> He is a righteous Usopp I can dig it
[2:56:16] <$Big_King_Coconut> infinite exploding arrows
[2:56:18] <cassiecagedd> how dare i
[2:56:18] <Louie_Salmon> You can use this to combo enemies on the overworld
[2:56:20] <%Shadicara> Snipe it
[2:56:22] <%Dotta5> Dotta5 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 3 month anniversary, but years of laughs had, keep it up Pat apatDab
[2:56:25] <heartlesshealer> There's more party members in the floating prison? :0
[2:56:30] <%tizz86> @fatally_furious i noticed him and took the alternative path. had to reload save to get him
[2:56:31] <asmistake> they never explain the explosion part
[2:56:32] <KZN02> Just one
[2:56:32] <+alucard929> @AngriestPat Ajna's moveset changed again. Just a heads-up.
[2:56:34] <%Shadicara> More party members PogChamp
[2:56:35] <+StrawberryPantsu> Hey it's Try Baker
[2:56:36] <$SvenHolgersson> shut UP Dhar
[2:56:44] <%GabeSweetMan> There's one more OPTIONAL party member who you CAN miss as far as I know.
[2:56:44] <%QueequegTheater> @StrawberryPantsu Matt Mercer
[2:56:48] <%GrayMatterMiner> man, slow time too
[2:56:50] <asmistake> there, now you can fight it
[2:56:54] <+blitzrush1200> literally just did you're job
[2:56:56] <KZN02> Za waruldo
[2:56:57] <%Rumbutt> oroLUL
[2:57:01] <%ThePuddingDead> thats the one tiny thing i have with the writing
[2:57:01] <1matheuw> this zebei is a loser isnt he
[2:57:08] <%Metballs> Sure is
[2:57:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you can jump and pause mid air with that
[2:57:10] <blackbookalpha> use bow for time stop
[2:57:10] <+kylerqaz22> Welcome to Ajna's less fun moveset for most of the game
[2:57:10] <%TheAsianAvenger96> suck it zebei
[2:57:12] <$SvenHolgersson> No that would be Dhar
[2:57:12] <%tizz86> yep
[2:57:14] <asmistake> It was nothin'! A baby could have done what I did
[2:57:15] <joedatuous> be nice to him
[2:57:15] <$spardanwarrior> You can aim in midair btw
[2:57:15] <%Kiiper> @QueequegTheater It's a meme Matt Mercer is who they get when they can't get Troy Baker
[2:57:16] <suikudo> Fuck Zebei
[2:57:18] <%transporterthesequel> SAVE
[2:57:18] <heartlesshealer> Pat forgoes saving
[2:57:18] <MasterDecoder> @1matheuw Mostly, he's a wet blanket later on
[2:57:25] <duffydirty> zebei is such a loser im going to unsubscribe from dhar
[2:57:26] <star_feline> Zebei it's a loser but at least he didn't kill my dad Kappa
[2:57:29] <%GabeSweetMan> Admittedly the BOW is one of the less fun additions to the platforming.
[2:57:31] <worldbrand> Oh
[2:57:31] <%ThePuddingDead> I KNEW IT
[2:57:33] <%SilvaChariot0133> @AngriestPat Up-attack on second attack and beyond to use bow, and down-attack after to detonate arrow
[2:57:35] <+skm742> I believe the explosion part is explained in the abilities menu: It's Bom.
[2:57:35] <%GrayMatterMiner> bow in combat lol
[2:57:36] <%TheQButton> Oh...
[2:57:36] <%SolverCODO> I kinda love how they gave him a handsome voice and conceal his face at first. they made it dorky on purpose im sure
[2:57:36] <lotharrio> Yeah, she got a new weapon.
[2:57:37] <%ThePuddingDead> I KNEW HE'D REACT LIKE THAT
[2:57:40] <+Order_of_Mystery> is Anja absorbing skills from the people she's eaten, too? Is she just Kirby?
[2:57:41] <%gekizenbu> oh dear what is this moveset
[2:57:48] <%floralkami> Inb4 fuck Zebei
[2:57:48] <asmistake> razmi nooo
[2:57:48] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah the arrow attack sucks unless you know the secret tech
[2:57:57] <%TheQButton> So are you gunna get a weapon to replace every normal?
[2:57:58] <mrshazboto> Yeah so Ajna's string changes throughout the game. Your observation about her down string? It's her BEST move right now for you
[2:57:59] <KUYAmoPESh> I love this techno Hindu theme
[2:57:59] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat You combo changes as you get new weapons. Ajna has a ton of combo strings
[2:57:59] <$SvenHolgersson> Zebei rulez
[2:58:00] <KZN02> Heal!
[2:58:01] <+RayDaug> Even though it was better, I never liked using Lenneth with a bow
[2:58:04] <heartlesshealer> Gensing gets big heals now!
[2:58:08] <Pat_Squared> so yeah with each additional weapon, ajna's combo route changes
[2:58:08] <%GabeSweetMan> EXPLOSION
[2:58:12] <tetrabrick1lt> ATTACK DOWN
[2:58:13] <DigbyMayor> Zebei has really fast
[2:58:18] <asmistake> punch punch punch punch AX
[2:58:19] <lotharrio> Her down-attack will explode the arrows she lodges into enemies. Assuming there are any.
[2:58:19] <+zalonar> Ajna's moveset is weirdly complicated. I still don't fully understand it.
[2:58:20] <+Pachi3000> Ajna's action can change randomly
[2:58:22] <%jakfan711> jakfan711 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[2:58:23] <%demegodz> SICK
[2:58:23] <star_feline> NICE
[2:58:26] <+desfore> @AngriestPat Ajna's attack strings change sometimes
[2:58:26] <Fear_Ranjer> ZEBEI IS SO COOL
[2:58:27] <%Kiiper> GOOD COMBO
[2:58:28] <Pat_Squared> up attack in the middle of combos usually use the bow
[2:58:30] <+runningfleet> its not random
[2:58:33] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Hold down for axe
[2:58:34] <+JacknZack27> Its not random
[2:58:34] <%GabeSweetMan> Down B for AXE
[2:58:35] <cassiecagedd> yeahhhhh
[2:58:36] <%GrayMatterMiner> so equip the ax
[2:58:36] <1matheuw> can switch mid combo?
[2:58:37] <%SilvaChariot0133> @AngriestPat then don't use bow
[2:58:37] <Louie_Salmon> You still have the axe
[2:58:37] <+FoolsArcade> you have to use that first
[2:58:38] <cassiecagedd> i felt the same
[2:58:38] <mrshazboto> Axe upper is still her first attack in the up string
[2:58:40] <duffydirty> hey guys, remember ginseng?
[2:58:43] <%Albadabar> Axe is down down now, or mid down
[2:58:43] <Vinebi21> For axe combo : Up-Down-Down
[2:58:44] <+FoolsArcade> if you do it after a move it goes to bow
[2:58:45] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 protip: Bow doesn't stop time, but does put it in an extremely slow state and prevents falling. this can be used to wait for disappearing platforms to recover.
[2:58:45] <suikudo> up attack is arrow
[2:58:46] <%Mendin> Yeah Ajna has full on strings that swap weapons back and forth
[2:58:46] <OBS_VinnieK> Start with Down Attack for Axe

[2:58:48] <UnfilteredComic> All of ajnas tools are context sensitive
[2:58:49] <+kylerqaz22> Nope welcome to shitty Ajna
[2:58:49] <Monkeyweed21> ajnas moveset is wierdly complex
[2:58:51] <xeslana666> lol
[2:58:52] <COMB711> axe will be your launcher if it's your first attack
[2:58:52] <%Shadicara> LUL
[2:58:55] <+kylerqaz22> Worst character imo
[2:58:56] <gordieda20> LUL
[2:58:56] <%Ragin_Asian06> heel turn
[2:58:57] <+blitzrush1200> axe nerfed
[2:58:57] <%Metballs> Ajna is just Dante
[2:58:57] <+JacknZack27> Down attack after firing arrows detonates arrows
[2:58:58] <lotharrio> Axe combo is: Up attack, down attack, down attack.
[2:59:00] <blackbookalpha> Ajna's dumb
[2:59:00] <brosephmike> Ajna is basically megaman
[2:59:01] <%transporterthesequel> GREATEST AXE BETRAYLS
[2:59:02] <+Pachi3000> Ele-phant
[2:59:03] <$SvenHolgersson> Ajna is just Dante then

[2:59:04] <%dekkitout> AXE, YOU TREACHEROUS WHORE!
[2:59:07] <%Muzzle131> THIS BETRAYAL
[2:59:08] <%ThePuddingDead> never heard of a shielf?
[2:59:10] <WarchiefGoldva> @AngriestPat Your moveset changes as you play the game. Axe upper is the first up+attack in Ajna's string now - every up+attack after is a bow shot.
[2:59:11] <%floralkami> Her attacks are context sensitive
[2:59:11] <%ThePuddingDead> shield*
[2:59:14] <BigNerdSam> LUL

[2:59:15] <%demegodz> Big dumb
[2:59:16] <mcgaggles> Zebei speaks Canadian
[2:59:19] <$SvenHolgersson> Axe you're almost as bad as Dhar
[2:59:19] <valriot> BIG DUMB
[2:59:20] <asmistake> i trusted you, axe
[2:59:23] <%Shadicara> She is pat, never heard of shield Kappa
[2:59:23] <garbageheaphound> Hey do people who aren't in your party get xp?
[2:59:25] <+Pachi3000> Solid logic
[2:59:25] <ECRead> BIG SMUG
[2:59:26] <worldbrand> his smug aura mocks me
[2:59:27] <KZN02> Zebei knows what an elevator is?
[2:59:29] <Louie_Salmon> Ajna so aggro, she literally does not know what a shield is
[2:59:33] <%gekizenbu> drop thine shield
[2:59:35] <lotharrio> I think the third attack can be a neutral, too. Ajna's strings are complicatd.
[2:59:35] <COMB711> @GarbageNirvana yea
[2:59:39] <%Shadicara> Smash everything
[2:59:39] <PkSilent01> is Dhar voiced by Ben Disken (he kinda sounds like Lorenz from FE3H)

[3:00:38] <+Grayhammatter> you'll get it ya baby
[3:00:42] <%floralkami> @arkv01 okay, dhar is a shit, but that's too far
[3:00:43] <Tucker0603> dhar might be a murderer but he is trying to be sensible
[3:00:45] <+D00msDayDan> @ThePuddingDead well then maybe they shouldn't have burned down her village and killed her dad
[3:00:47] <+Nymphonomicon> TIGER

[3:00:54] <mistspade> you get it after the first town I think

[3:00:57] <Baconrath> oh good
[3:01:00] <+Pachi3000> Doesn't work for Ginseng because his Up isn't an attack
[3:01:01] <%ThePuddingDead> but he the enemy tho! LUL
[3:01:02] <%PlagueOfGripes> Up then Down or Down then Up to break guards
[3:01:02] <$SvenHolgersson> Hitler might be a murderer but he did good art
[3:01:04] <asmistake> can you still charge heal on an armored enemy?
[3:01:08] <+DoggyT> DOwn should be Axe attacks, Up is Bow Atacks, chained with Standing Jabs for extentions.
[3:01:08] <slim_shady2019> Training mode later
[3:01:16] <KZN02> Hitler was a mediocre artist
[3:01:16] <Dakuu75> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, How're you and Paige? You guys feeling better?
[3:01:17] <duffydirty> zebei is the shit
[3:01:22] <%honeyman18> Hitler was a shiity artist too
[3:01:28] <+DoggyT> Axe is Heavy, causes 'Down' Swing when swung.
[3:01:29] <$SvenHolgersson> Just like Dhar
[3:01:33] <%AngriestAngryArtist> @AngriestPat Your first hit with anja will be a jab first no matter what
[3:01:34] <%tizz86> @plagueofgripes down up is my goto
[3:01:34] <%Saltmeisterr> oh god wtf chat
[3:01:34] <%Mendin> Remember that Ginseng can down-B to cprojectile into a combo from further away if you need
[3:01:34] <%Shadicara> pew pew pew
[3:01:37] <KZN02> Hitler is only good at drawing architecture
[3:01:38] <%Kirby_Sauce> @AngriestPat Dhar's meter can't be blocked, and leaves targets open to further damage
[3:01:38] <Fear_Ranjer> Indr's Pride
[3:01:39] <coracor> right in the dick
[3:01:39] <%Saltmeisterr> I just got back
[3:01:41] <%GabeSweetMan> Close to that CHEEVO
[3:01:43] <heartlesshealer> yeah, the down attack everyone is yelling at you about is after the arrow attack string
[3:01:43] <ScreamLord> DICK SHOT
[3:01:45] <worldbrand> were steam achievement notifs always this obnoxious?
[3:01:49] <+Havictos> @Angriestpat Not yet you will about 3 areas from now
[3:01:49] <%honeyman18> off model architecture
[3:01:50] <%demegodz> DIC K SHOT
[3:01:50] <star_feline> Cheevo hype
[3:01:51] <%GabeSweetMan> That poor man's penis.
[3:01:57] <asmistake> <3 up!
[3:02:02] <WarchiefGoldva> D+A's first attack is the jab followed by the big axe murder.
[3:02:06] <%ThePuddingDead> pew
[3:02:07] <KZN02> Arrow to the dick
[3:02:09] <%GabeSweetMan> WOW

[3:02:12] <Zombrocom> Woah that hitch
[3:02:13] <DracaenaLeaf> See what?
[3:02:14] <%ThePuddingDead> knew it
[3:02:14] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @pat ajna: up attack, up attack, down attack is the combo you want
[3:02:15] <KaliasTV> Devs screwed up achievement implementation
[3:02:16] <garbageheaphound> so does anyone know if party members that arent in use level up
[3:02:17] <+Pachi3000> One thing you learn in this game is to combo between characters
[3:02:18] <gordieda20> LUL
[3:02:19] <lotharrio> Dhar told you it will shoot down arrows.
[3:02:20] <%ThePuddingDead> pew once again
[3:02:23] <Louie_Salmon> For whatever reason the steam achievements are super spammy
[3:02:24] <%GabeSweetMan> I never figured out how to kill this thing....
[3:02:26] <%ThePuddingDead> and another?
[3:02:28] <+desfore> @AngriestPat It attacks arrows from the front!
[3:02:32] <KZN02> Run to the hole
[3:02:33] <%ThePuddingDead> do i see 5?
[3:02:36] <+blitzrush1200> spent like 20 minutes trying to kill that thing
[3:02:38] <%GabeSweetMan> Does there EXIST a way to kill this enemy?
[3:02:39] <+runningfleet> @garbageheaphound they do but levels almost dont matter
[3:02:39] <lionmanguy> Okay now this time
[3:02:40] <+Pachi3000> Can't get that one
[3:02:45] <%ThePuddingDead> and a 6 one
[3:02:47] <cassiecagedd> You cant kill that boi sorry
[3:02:48] <Dakuu75> Knuckles: Oh-no~!
[3:02:48] <%ThePuddingDead> from the right!
[3:02:48] <+DoggyT> Maybe slide under it?
[3:02:52] <$SvenHolgersson> LUL
[3:02:55] <+LTKonnor> YEET
[3:02:55] <+Pachi3000> You can't attack them from the front

[3:03:39] <%GabeSweetMan> Quickly throw onions at them!
[3:03:46] <%Reanimator83> Is Pat trying to face fuck things again?
[3:03:47] <%GabeSweetMan> Perfect Blocks achievement.
[3:03:48] <%jiin6> thank you matt mercer
[3:03:50] <heartlesshealer> so you use Ajna's down attack after her own arrow attacks
[3:03:53] <worldbrand> what the
[3:03:54] <$Big_King_Coconut> It's High Noon
[3:03:57] <+Havictos> Block for blue
[3:03:57] <%ChaosAethr> ???
[3:04:00] <garbageheaphound> one of his lines is 'you are already dead'
[3:04:00] <%Mendin> It was set t o the drone
[3:04:01] <%asmistake> asmistake subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! ey cool
[3:04:02] <Roach3s> this game is so cool holy shit
[3:04:06] <worldbrand> oh
[3:04:10] <%Mendin> So the punch whiffed and the axe-swing hit horizontally and clipped the guard
[3:04:11] <+DoggyT> Alarm system is up high, gotta shoot it down first.
[3:04:12] <heartlesshealer> he did it!
[3:04:13] <StarkMaximum> I came in late how's the stream going overall
[3:04:18] <%asmistake> have you tried Zeb's meter yet?
[3:04:19] <KZN02> Knock the flying enemy down before hitting it with ground combos
[3:04:22] <coracor> YEET
[3:04:22] <%demegodz> YEET
[3:04:23] <%ThePuddingDead> its a beautiful mess
[3:04:24] <worldbrand> a leech to the dick
[3:04:26] <%ThePuddingDead> what else is new
[3:04:26] <WarchiefGoldva> BIG YEET
[3:04:28] <heartlesshealer> pat please save
[3:04:33] <%SilvaChariot0133> It's a bit complex
[3:04:34] <%Shadicara> Save pat
[3:04:37] <%asmistake> WORTH
[3:04:37] <%ThePuddingDead> LUL
[3:04:38] <StarkMaximum> oof. oof. oof.
[3:04:39] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Its hard to understand at first
[3:04:42] <mistspade> it gets goofier
[3:04:46] <StarkMaximum> YOU CAN DO SUPERS ON THE OVERWORLD???
[3:04:47] <+FoolsArcade> Pat you need to MASH more
[3:04:48] <coracor> Pat why are you waiting for them to unstack
[3:04:50] <krymzen5> think of her like dante
[3:04:58] <Dakuu75> @StarkMaximum can you?
[3:04:59] <%floralkami> @AngriestPat oh yeah your cheer after shooting arrows make them explode
[3:05:00] <+FoolsArcade> you're holding onto aattacks too much
[3:05:02] <Ids560> you can shoot enemies with the bow to fill meter before combat
[3:05:05] <ミュウレ4242> just do the monster mash.
[3:05:10] <%Mendin> @StarkMaximum Only a block-parry
[3:05:15] <%chronotriggerhappy123> you need to do up and down attacks faster also you can attack with another character during another charactyers combo for more damage
[3:05:16] <%Mendin> *parry-riposte
[3:05:18] <%asmistake> dang
[3:05:21] <StarkMaximum> @Mendin Ohhhhh is that what that was, i wasn't really looking too closely
[3:05:24] <1matheuw> wow they hate best girl
[3:05:35] <UnfilteredComic> Switch targets
[3:05:41] <%torontototoro> torontototoro subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 6 months! Ate at Au Pied De Cochon like you recommended. Such great, rich food in MTL. You live there; how are you not MORE fat??? Construction is just like you and Woolz warned about. Wtf is with the dig site on Berri? apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[3:05:43] <%asmistake> razmi is really squishy
[3:05:43] <%GabeSweetMan> Pat, just so you know, at the start of EVERY battle, mash like crazy, you can hit EVERY enemy all at once because they all spawn on the same spot.
[3:05:50] <%floralkami> CHEER
[3:05:52] <%Skittlesoul> did stream die?
[3:05:57] <%Kiiper> Does Pat not realise the Ginseng stores charges from normal attack?
[3:05:58] <Naho_Saenoki> Combat is reminiscent of Valkyrie Profile's at a glance to me.
[3:05:58] <%Albadabar> nah still runnin
[3:06:03] <%LaughingCatt> fine for ,e
[3:06:04] <Dakuu75> @1matheuw who's best girl? Razmi?
[3:06:05] <heartlesshealer> stream is not dead, refresh your page
[3:06:18] <%asmistake> Razmi is forever best girl.
[3:06:18] <1matheuw> @Dakuu75 of course
[3:06:19] <%Mendin> @AngriestPat YOU'RE LOCKED ONTO THE DRONE NOT THE SOLDIER
[3:06:20] <coracor> you're doing ground attacks against a flying enemy
[3:06:21] <%chronotriggerhappy123> Razmi best girl, Thorani best mom
[3:06:22] <%GabeSweetMan> I do wish the enemy selection was a tad easier.
[3:06:25] <%Morbidmort> @AngriestPat You targeting a flying enemy with ground attacks
[3:06:26] <+nekodelic> Pat...
[3:06:27] <WarchiefGoldva> If you look in the party screen, there's stars for HP, Attack and Speed. Razmi has tiny HP so she's very squish.
[3:06:27] <+zalonar> you're locked onto the drone
[3:06:28] <%asmistake> Thorani indeed best mom.
[3:06:30] <nuane> do battles normally yake this long or is pat fucking up combos
[3:06:32] <%tizz86> @angriestpat upon encounters, I'f there is a group, your attacks will be AOE. Use the first round to your advantage.
[3:06:36] <+JacknZack27> Pat you should start pressing buttons the second the fight starts. You’ll have the advantage and hit everyone at once if you do that.
[3:06:38] <%ThePuddingDead> then do it tho!
[3:06:39] <Dakuu75> @1matheuw <3
[3:06:40] <%GabeSweetMan> It feels weird to me that you can only toggle enemies by pushing left and right.
[3:06:41] <+runningfleet> the arrow is not a starter
[3:06:42] <$Piemono> Arrow only comes on second Up
[3:06:43] <+FoolsArcade> arrow doesn't come out as first attack
[3:06:44] <%PlagueOfGripes> welcome to Indivisible
[3:06:45] <+Havictos> @Angriestpat Up then down attack or vice versa to break guards
[3:06:47] <+FoolsArcade> arrow only comes after an attack
[3:06:47] <%Metballs> That's not...
[3:06:49] <cassiecagedd> its only the last 2 hits sadly
[3:06:49] <Louie_Salmon> That's now how Zebei works
[3:06:50] <heartlesshealer> Don't forget to save
[3:06:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> Arrow is only on second and beyond
[3:06:52] <%chronotriggerhappy123> ajna always attacks with the axe first in her up combo
[3:06:55] <Monkeyweed21> ajna does launcher for first up attack
[3:06:57] <%Shadicara> Go back and save anyway pat passed a save point
[3:06:57] <Tytangamer> She only shoots the arrow after she does her launcher.
[3:07:00] <lotharrio> First attack in her string from Up is an axe. It sucks, yeah.
[3:07:00] <+blitzrush1200> different attack on initial
[3:07:02] <+JacknZack27> The first attack is an axe swing. The second is arrow
[3:07:05] <StarkMaximum> There's like a million save points he's fine
[3:07:06] <%AngriestAngryArtist> @AngriestPat first hit on up is the axe launcher 2nd hit up will be arrows and so forth
[3:07:06] <UnfilteredComic> Ajnas moveset is really unclear
[3:07:08] <$Big_King_Coconut> her moveset is jank
[3:07:10] <%PlagueOfGripes> This is what I don't like about the combat system
[3:07:13] <+squirtkitten> i heard this game is like 10 hours long
[3:07:16] <%GabeSweetMan> NEEDS A MOVESET very much so
[3:07:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so yeah, for those, use arrow boy to get them down and her to sweep em up
[3:07:22] <Treyu000> if only there was practice
[3:07:22] <Rengekiyo> this remind me of ar tonelico
[3:07:24] <UnfilteredComic> @squirtkitten I got 20 out of it
[3:07:25] <+DoggyT> It's a werid system, you cans tart witht eh Arrow, but you should hit Up 'JUST BEFORE' you press Anja's attack.
[3:07:25] <MasterDecoder> @squirtkitten Longer
[3:07:26] <Baconrath> mmmm kickstarter jank
[3:07:26] <+blitzrush1200> trust she gets more weapons that changes her moveset constantly
[3:07:27] <%chronotriggerhappy123> use Zebei to knock down arial enemies then send ajna in while they fall
[3:07:27] <+FrostedZaibatsu> 30+ hrs
[3:07:27] <cassiecagedd> Ajnas expanding move set is one of the most annoying parts of the game imo
[3:07:28] <+desfore> @AngriestPat Ajna is the only character I've encountered so far with branching combos
[3:07:28] <%GabeSweetMan> ESPECIALLY for Ajna, who's moveset changes throughout the game.
[3:07:29] <%AngriestAngryArtist> @AngriestPat basically through to cram a shitload of stuff on her way too much
[3:07:30] <nuane> no moveset list?
[3:07:32] <Tytangamer> PAT, LEARN TO DO COMBO
[3:07:32] <Louie_Salmon> Attacks are not universal in how they work at all, everyone has their own thing going on
[3:07:32] <krymzen5> you get used to it, i liked the versitility
[3:07:33] <valriot> @squirtkitten No LUL try 25-30 hours
[3:07:34] <+DoggyT> Least that's what I've found.
[3:07:40] <%PlagueOfGripes> the combo also changes based on which character you start as
[3:07:42] <$Big_King_Coconut> zebei's down is a launcher, ajna's up is a launcher. makes perfect sense
[3:07:43] <%Metballs> Her up is a launcher into juggle
[3:07:44] <Aydarkzero> wait what?
[3:07:47] <StarkMaximum> @squirtkitten Factually untrue I've been playing it for four streams now, I stream two hours at a time, and I'm not done and I'm pretty sure I'm not close to done
[3:07:47] <%Metballs> You need the launcher
[3:07:48] <+squirtkitten> @valriot So not even a quarter of regular RPG Length? Ouch
[3:07:48] <+kylerqaz22> Ajna is the least fun character in the game imo
[3:07:48] <%tizz86> @angriestpat you'll get the hang of it. it takes getting used to
[3:07:51] <Dakuu75> what info?
[3:07:52] <%transporterthesequel> I would guess that she has MOAR mechanics
[3:07:53] <Monkeyweed21> you havent seen shit
[3:07:54] <%GabeSweetMan> Don't worry we'll scream when you can get him.
[3:07:54] <Fear_Ranjer> This is why this game needs a proper movelist
[3:07:56] <StarkMaximum> HELL YEA TUNGAR
[3:07:56] <%SilvaChariot0133> you kind of have to just lab her to learn her branches
[3:07:57] <cassiecagedd> HE IS GOD LIKE PAT
[3:07:58] <mercado94> This reminds me of wakfu
[3:07:59] <+forlorncarton> It's possible to miss that guy
[3:08:00] <%Saltmeisterr> TUNGAR
[3:08:00] <%GunEden> best char
[3:08:02] <%Mendin> That guy is legit, look at how many walls they put him behind
[3:08:02] <KZN02> Tungar
[3:08:02] <Louie_Salmon> @plagueofgripes WHAT. How is it even more complicated than I thought
[3:08:03] <COMB711> HE'S MISSABLE, BE CAREFUL
[3:08:04] <%PlagueOfGripes> also you can get out of the animation sequence by switching to another attack command then back into what you wanted
[3:08:04] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Best character Tungar
[3:08:05] <StarkMaximum> You get him later
[3:08:05] <+Pachi3000> You can miss him, FYI - can't get him just yet
[3:08:06] <%GabeSweetMan> Tungar is later in dungeon.
[3:08:07] <+FoolsArcade> You can't get him here
[3:08:10] <StarkMaximum> Like very soon later but later
[3:08:10] <%moogleboy1984> Tungar x Ren OTP
[3:08:10] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Later
[3:08:12] <+FoolsArcade> you get him a bit later
[3:08:13] <+LucidProtean> later in the dungeon, secret
[3:08:14] <UnfilteredComic> Sees a short character, "Ah yes, this guy is fucking cool"
[3:08:16] <heartlesshealer> he's behind a lot of doors that need breaking
[3:08:17] <%GabeSweetMan> We'll yell nonstop when you can get to him.
[3:08:17] <%tizz86> @kylerqaz22 you're not wrong
[3:08:19] <tank7013> All of those doors LUL
[3:08:20] <KZN02> You can’t get him from there
[3:08:20] <+Pachi3000> You get him soon, but not quite yet
[3:08:21] <+Havictos> Turn off power
[3:08:21] <%transporterthesequel> They REALLY wanna keep him in
[3:08:23] <%chronotriggerhappy123> attack with zebei and during his last attack in the combo start ajnas normal combos or down attacks
[3:08:24] <KZN02> Later you will
[3:08:24] <%PlagueOfGripes> of course Pat is paying attention to none of this so I guess that's just for you guys, chat
[3:08:25] <%asmistake> tungar IS pretty cool though
[3:08:25] <Fear_Ranjer> I LOVE THIS MUSIC
[3:08:27] <+DoggyT> Get him, but 'DON'T use him here. you'll need more Arial attackers.
[3:08:28] <joedatuous> pat you cant miss characters just so ya knwo
[3:08:28] <%blaccbird914> you can get him here you need to wait for something to happen here first
[3:08:28] <$Big_King_Coconut> He's the best at what he does
[3:08:28] <lotharrio> Lots of people miss him.
[3:08:30] <$SvenHolgersson> when is doggo
[3:08:34] <valriot> @squirtkitten I means it's not a real RPG, party members don't learn new attacks, other than some supers when you get 3 bars of meter
[3:08:37] <%Gogogolem> Also he's just you with a darker skin tone
[3:08:38] <StarkMaximum> @joedatuous Factually untrue.
[3:08:49] <+squirtkitten> @valriot So why do they keep marketing it as an RPG if its just a fighting game?
[3:08:51] <UnfilteredComic> @PlagueOfGripes Dont worry, people love to hear you complain
[3:08:53] <Monkeyweed21> @SvenHolgersson Doggo is VERY LATE
[3:08:54] <joedatuous> NotLikeThis
[3:08:58] <%king_wragles> @PlagueOfGripes thanks for the tip then, I guess.
[3:08:58] <%Mendin> Big Combo
[3:09:00] <StarkMaximum> You have a party and you level up that's an RPG
[3:09:01] <+runningfleet> no one is missable what are you talking about
[3:09:02] <mistspade> @SvenHolgersson doggo is like 10 hours in
[3:09:06] <%Mendin> Diggo is like 75% through the game yeah
[3:09:08] <%tizz86> @plagueofgripes thx plague, i never tried that
[3:09:22] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> The blocks leading to him look smashable.
[3:09:23] <$SvenHolgersson> well dang
[3:09:24] <%AngriestAngryArtist> like that "nice" she does I have no idea how that comes out lOl!
[3:09:40] <StarkMaximum> *** "As the game's first OPTIONAL Incarnations"
[3:09:42] <valriot> @squirtkitten I mean it's still a RPGish game. The fighting game stuff doesn't go beyond juggling enemies, and stuff like perfect guarding
[3:09:48] <$SvenHolgersson> Gunna start this tomorrow for sure but holy hell I love Razmi and Zebei already
[3:09:48] <joylent_blue> that sounds like a SOTN sound effect
[3:09:50] <+runningfleet> @AngriestAngryArtist after any arrow attack a down+attack will trigger it
[3:09:55] <StarkMaximum> @valriot There's throw-teching too later
[3:09:57] <%logoth_> This game's pacing is fuckey
[3:09:57] <+KSabot> dem pears
[3:09:58] <ECRead> oh nice, perfect block keeps you from dying
[3:10:00] <%chronotriggerhappy123> when ajna sticks arrows in the enemy, her down attack detonates them, thats where her nice comes from
[3:10:08] <RogerPoore> I'm assuming pat realized L1+r1 full revive/heal is busted.
[3:10:09] <%GabeSweetMan> Wow they sure are picking on your healer.
[3:10:10] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> parry-master pat
[3:10:16] <Zombrocom> The SotN level up noise is triggered my nostalgia hard
[3:10:24] <+FoolsArcade> you gotta mash neutral B more with Ginseng
[3:10:28] <+squirtkitten> @valriot Ive also heard everything is bad except the combat, and the kickstarter characters run from okay to fanfiction level out of placeness
[3:10:30] <joedatuous> blocked
[3:10:32] <%PlagueOfGripes> basically you have weaker moves that gather enemies together, launcher moves that can miss if the enemy isn't either air/ground, and normals that hit more reliably
[3:10:34] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat solid parries
[3:10:35] <WarchiefGoldva> @AngriestAngryArtist The arrows you shoot will all explode after her cheer attack. She only does it if you've shot an arrow, too.
[3:10:40] <+FoolsArcade> you gotta stack those healings better
[3:10:41] <heartlesshealer> I thiiink, you can boost Gensing's healing without it needing to hit the enemy
[3:10:47] <%chronotriggerhappy123> zebei can knock enemies out of the air, use him FIRST
[3:10:52] <%tizz86> im thinking the first "big boss" sequence will be the end tonight
[3:10:54] <%asmistake> you did it
[3:10:56] <%GabeSweetMan> He figured it out!
[3:10:56] <%SilvaChariot0133> Detonates, yes
[3:11:02] <%TheQButton> You're getting it!
[3:11:02] <gordieda20> Boom
[3:11:03] <krymzen5> yeeah thats her whole deal
[3:11:06] <%PlagueOfGripes> you get an island girl later that gathers enemies together super well. then later a punch girl that can do infinite supers
[3:11:09] <$MajorCrasher> it's almost like they gave Pat a ranged character to help deal with flying enemies right when there were a bunch
[3:11:13] <tmix1600> So is parrying easy or is Pat just good from third strike?
[3:11:16] <heartbabe29> id buy this just cause the main girl is so cute tbh
[3:11:16] <+desfore> Save!
[3:11:18] <%transporterthesequel> Save point
[3:11:20] <%asmistake> Ginseng grinds up the competition!
[3:11:20] <%GabeSweetMan> Ajna's moveset is CRAZY big and we don't get a list.
[3:11:21] <heartlesshealer> goodbye save shrine
[3:11:22] <Calek> parrying is easy just mash it out
[3:11:22] <+KingGoblodyte> SAVE
[3:11:24] <%Mendin> Yeah Ajna keeps getting more and more weirdly chaining elaborate combos and never tells you about them
[3:11:28] <%GabeSweetMan> WHELP
[3:11:32] <%Albadabar> RIP
[3:11:33] <%GabeSweetMan> Let's hope he wins this.
[3:11:33] <televisedrevolting> Has Pat found the Turban Man, yet?
[3:11:33] <%transporterthesequel> WHEEELP
[3:11:38] <%ThePuddingDead> good thing he saved
[3:11:39] <%Mendin> turban man is next
[3:11:40] <+squirtkitten> !uptime

[3:11:46] <KZN02> One whack
[3:11:47] <heartbabe29> pat is a pro gamer he doesnt need to save you guys
[3:11:48] <%PlagueOfGripes> time to die
[3:11:49] <%tizz86> @plagueofgripes "punch girl" is top tier
[3:11:49] <%asmistake> wait for it
[3:11:53] <$SvenHolgersson> OH FUCK
[3:11:53] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @tmix1600 its fairly easy if you understand the enemies attack timing
[3:11:54] <%LaughingCatt> hit it again
[3:11:56] <star_feline> :^( pointy man
[3:11:57] <lotharrio> Ajna's witch friend is so supportive.
[3:11:57] <%Morbidmort> Fuck

[3:11:59] <%asmistake> BIG DOGGO
[3:11:59] <%PlagueOfGripes> Pat die now
[3:12:02] <%GabeSweetMan> Time for apatBig Shit Pushing.
[3:12:03] <JonEWorldbeater> Almost like there was a reason that Save point was there or something
[3:12:04] <WarchiefGoldva> That's a Zone boss.
[3:12:05] <KZN02> Zone boss
[3:12:05] <%transporterthesequel> If only there was some sort of save point
[3:12:06] <joedatuous> oh god its that thing
[3:12:07] <garbageheaphound> PEOPLE HANDS
[3:12:08] <StarkMaximum> Is this the boss Woolie was referring to about learning the system?

[3:12:14] <MasterDecoder> Zone worked on this boss
[3:12:14] <%asmistake> also gross, it has too many human feets
[3:12:17] <+FoolsArcade> stop wasting your heals
[3:12:18] <DigbyMayor> This is the first hard boss
[3:12:21] <Coystick> Reminds me of Breath or Fire 4
[3:12:25] <%aeravon> Help him not miss the hidden character guys
[3:12:28] <daisyyyy> this bayonetta lookin mfer
[3:12:30] <%Mendin> Stark I think it was the armored two-sword fatty in the ruins that had to have a combo to break its posture
[3:12:31] <StarkMaximum> We will, I'm sure
[3:12:32] <Coystick> Breath of*
[3:12:37] <+kylerqaz22> Why heal if you dont need heals

[3:12:47] <StarkMaximum> @Mendin Oh that's prolly it yeah. I completely forgot which boss was which so I didn't know what he was referring to
[3:12:50] <%tizz86> @digbymayor the adds suck
[3:12:51] <Pat_Squared> I wish more bosses summoned adds like this guy
[3:12:59] <%PlagueOfGripes> DPS raceeeeeeeee
[3:13:00] <KZN02> Zebei’s up attack is effective against large enemies and will generate more meter
[3:13:01] <%Kirby_Sauce> this fight was easy
[3:13:02] <Insanity97> my brain can't handle this game
[3:13:03] <%Mendin> He mentioned a combo adjudicator and that's the only thing I can think of
[3:13:09] <ECRead> i remember this boss being much harder in the backer previews
[3:13:20] <+rdark_ksu> thank goodness I can watch since i'm farther in than this
[3:13:22] <ThDark> Is this the monster Zone helped animate, looks familiar

[3:13:38] <1matheuw> looks like a bayonetta angel
[3:13:39] <daisyyyy> yea im not sure id be able to parse this game...im content to watch others
[3:13:40] <WarchiefGoldva> @Mendin The combo adjudicator boss only shows up at the end of the next dungeon.
[3:13:41] <gordieda20> Big heals
[3:13:42] <%asmistake> welp

[3:13:56] <+desfore> Honey is the best healer
[3:13:57] <StarkMaximum> Yeah focus boss
[3:13:58] <+FoolsArcade> you can out DPS the boss
[3:13:59] <%Shadicara> Fuck em just focus the boss
[3:14:03] <Louie_Salmon> Sure would be cool to have someone with a massively damaging AOE isntead of a second, slower healer
[3:14:04] <cassiecagedd> target the boss tbh they all die if you get him
[3:14:05] <%Albadabar> Ginseng's heal is fanastic if you just keep attacking with B throughout
[3:14:06] <%Mendin> Holy hell I didn't realize this guy could puke out the redbois
[3:14:08] <beefcakemanthrob> it's like the adds will just keep getting stronger...
[3:14:10] <coracor> it's a dps race pat :)

[3:14:44] <WarchiefGoldva> I can't believe that kid is dead.
[3:14:50] <%dekkitout> Dhar: "I will bury this child."
[3:14:51] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @AngriestPat focus boss, its a bitch to fight the adds and they die if it dies

[3:16:27] <$Big_King_Coconut> no one could have known this would happen
[3:16:27] <%LaughingCatt> IF ONLY WE WERE WARNED
[3:16:28] <$SvenHolgersson> If only we had a smart person in the party
[3:16:28] <1matheuw> dhar didnt even warn them wahta dick
[3:16:28] <Coystick> How could Dhar have done this
[3:16:28] <%floralkami> Yeah, if only
[3:16:29] <%chronotriggerhappy123> you can attack with ALL 4 AT ONCE if you want
[3:16:30] <indig0bird> She wants to die, I understand her.
[3:16:30] <$SvenHolgersson> Oh well
[3:16:32] <%GabeSweetMan> DHAR THIS IS YOUR FAULT
[3:16:34] <%Kirby_Sauce> @AngriestPat you can have more than 1 person do their action at once. you can have ginseg heal WHILE someone is dealing damage
[3:16:36] <+blitzrush1200> why didnt you warn us Dhar!!!

[3:16:36] <%Muzzle131> WHY DIDN'T ANYONE WARN US
[3:16:42] <%Albadabar> NOW find that dude you want to get
[3:16:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> NOW you can pick up the new character.

[3:16:58] <gordieda20> The return of Blanka
[3:17:00] <+olliedelosa> @angriestpat Don’t leave the fortress without getting the other party member
[3:17:01] <+DoggyT> ANYTHING WOULD DO!!!
[3:17:01] <%ThePuddingDead> alright chat, bets down, he misses turbanman
[3:17:02] <%GabeSweetMan> @Kirby_Sauce He can but everyone pauses their actions while another character is acting so it still gives you time to think.
[3:17:04] <Naho_Saenoki> @AngriestPat GET COOL GUY NOW
[3:17:05] <%ThePuddingDead> any takers?
[3:17:05] <mcgaggles> "i am a genius oh no"

[3:17:15] <heartlesshealer> So the security crap with the red doors is disabled now
[3:17:21] <%littleogre92> Ship's falling, but the elevator still works. Great engineering there.
[3:17:22] <%Metballs> Get Tungar and swap out Zebei because he's a nerd
[3:17:22] <marvel877> you can still get him later if you miss him here.
[3:17:23] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat It's Dhar's fault this is even happening to begin with
[3:17:24] <%aeravon> Dont forget to unlock Tungar!
[3:17:29] <%asmistake> Pat, do me a favor, and just mash like hell for one fight
[3:17:41] <%SilvaChariot0133> NO BULLY BibleThump
[3:17:46] <UnfilteredComic> Some attacks hit on z axis, theyre broken
[3:17:46] <WarchiefGoldva> @littleogre92 The same engineers that built Redgrave City's telephone system.
[3:17:48] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Must get Arabian Mario.
[3:17:50] <+MrSuplexArt> I missed Tungar, he shows up again quite a bit later so you can get him then
[3:17:50] <+temporal_zenith> @littleogre92 Considering it is the Big bad's elevator so he can get out it might not be a bad idea
[3:17:52] <%GabeSweetMan> Everyone get ready to spam when Tungar's hallway is coming up. We're still a little ways off though.
[3:17:55] <%SilvaChariot0133> *Wario
[3:17:55] <%chronotriggerhappy123> he never finishes ajnas combo :(
[3:17:58] <$SvenHolgersson> they big bois
[3:18:03] <$Big_King_Coconut> I love how chats like "ATTACK FASTER" but it doesn't make a difference
[3:18:03] <%tizz86> keep names and such to a minimum for spoiler sake
[3:18:03] <%Stratiotai2> HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys
[3:18:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> If you're going up in the elevator when the ship lands, technically you don't get any impact force. Everything still gonna crumble around you, but you might not turn to paste.
[3:18:11] <$SvenHolgersson> Ze-bae
[3:18:20] <benjiFG> every time razmi says "burn" I think it's paige
[3:18:27] <arkv01> my god this music is BANGING
[3:18:30] <%GabeSweetMan> @Big_King_Coconut Yeah I don't get that. It's actually a good idea at this point in the game to slow down and think over your options.
[3:18:31] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat You can totally miss a party member in this sequence
[3:18:36] <DigbyMayor> You can press A to dash
[3:18:40] <+DoggyT> USe the Bo before you run into any enemies.
[3:18:42] <$SvenHolgersson> Paige wishes she had that Tiger pelt
[3:18:43] <+DoggyT> Nice surprise.
[3:18:49] <grayjammer> How about say nothing if hes about to miss turbanman, because it’s not a big deal?
[3:18:51] <%asmistake> wow, a thousand people in this stream
[3:18:54] <+RealPT1> try juggling them when they start that hit stun animation
[3:18:58] <coracor> Poise
[3:19:00] <%SilvaChariot0133> Poise
[3:19:00] <+zalonar> they have armor
[3:19:02] <WarchiefGoldva> Poise.
[3:19:05] <Manwad> Does this game have more meter per combo speed like Valkyrie Profile?
[3:19:06] <Floofiie> Break Poise
[3:19:06] <%ThePuddingDead> cuz we like having fun here in chat
[3:19:07] <%GabeSweetMan> FUCK
[3:19:11] <Aydarkzero> hidden poise meter?
[3:19:11] <%Reanimator83> Elmo looks super comfortable apatWink
[3:19:11] <%Kirby_Sauce> Poise
[3:19:14] <+kylerqaz22> If only the game told you oh wait
[3:19:14] <star_feline> Super got squandered\
[3:19:15] <UnfilteredComic> Armor, 3rd hit sends them flying
[3:19:15] <1matheuw> party wipe yeah
[3:19:17] <JonEWorldbeater> 1
[3:19:22] <%chronotriggerhappy123> because you have to hit them WITH ALL THE COMBO not just 2 attacks of it
[3:19:22] <simulationbard> Big Bois with Big Poise
[3:19:23] <lotharrio> Just sleeping on those heals.
[3:19:31] <Floofiie> ??
[3:19:31] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Pat doesn't like attacking for some reason
[3:19:32] <ScreamLord> Party Wiped. NOW heal

[3:19:39] <Jathspuh> ???
[3:19:39] <%GabeSweetMan> wtf?
[3:19:40] <Cleric4gg> Ever played Valkyrie Profile, pat?
[3:19:41] <%asmistake> someone draw Pat with Elmo on his head like Razmi and Bom
[3:19:42] <PrinceOfEden> ?
[3:19:42] <%californaya> PARRYING TAKES METER, PAT
[3:19:43] <%Ninestempest> ???????????
[3:19:43] <coracor> Pat....
[3:19:44] <%SilvaChariot0133> monkaS

[3:19:52] <Tucker0603> THE FUCK IS PAT DOING
[3:19:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> MORTIS
[3:19:53] <%Ninestempest> ?????????????
[3:19:55] <$Big_King_Coconut> chat is so tilted LUL
[3:19:55] <%GabeSweetMan> did you WANT to die???
[3:19:55] <jase__x> oh man pat
[3:19:55] <+MrSuplexArt> yes, accept your fate
[3:19:56] <%corepool> why
[3:19:56] <+kd0g_> DSP?
[3:19:57] <ClairvoyantNara> Pat attack
[3:19:59] <StarkMaximum> well, blocking takes meter
[3:20:00] <%Kirby_Sauce> pat, you get meter from attacking to
[3:20:01] <BlindGato> Pats asleep
[3:20:02] <UnfilteredComic> NO
[3:20:04] <tank7013> No it doesn't
[3:20:05] <Tytangamer> Pat forgot how to video game.
[3:20:06] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Tiger face sad =(
[3:20:07] <%moogleboy1984> 3
[3:20:08] <%Mendin> Perfect Parry gets meter, blocking drains some meter
[3:20:09] <%tizz86> nope
[3:20:09] <%Ninestempest> you get meter from attacking lol
[3:20:11] <%asmistake> blocking while not taking damage takes meter
[3:20:11] <simulationbard> Standing there and getting hit, a bold strategy Cotton let's see if it works out
[3:20:12] <%GabeSweetMan> 3333333
[3:20:12] <ClairvoyantNara> coeMort
[3:20:12] <WaffleCakes> Attacking also gens meter almost no reason to not attack
[3:20:13] <+MrSuplexArt> HOLDING block takes meter
[3:20:14] <Tucker0603> NO
[3:20:15] <+SleazyShell> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:20:17] <%dante_must_die_exe> Pat BLOCKING takes meter, parying gives meter
[3:20:17] <%Rumbutt> Blocking drains meter, parry gains
[3:20:19] <Tytangamer> HOLDING BLOCK TAKES METER.
[3:20:19] <%Cervarian> HOLDING block takes meter - parrying gives meter, but attacking gives more.
[3:20:20] <%Kiiper> @AngriestPat holding parry takes meter, attacks hel;p build it, perfect and light parries give you meter back
[3:20:22] <DigbyMayor> YOU WERE LIED TO
[3:20:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pat got stuck in Infinite Tsukuyomi
[3:20:24] <%chronotriggerhappy123> PAT FINISH AJNAS GOD DAMN 3 HIT COMBO
[3:20:26] <Manwad> Blocking takes meter, parrying doesn't
[3:20:27] <%tizz86> blocking takes meter, perfect block build it
[3:20:33] <Aydarkzero> wait no game over for that?
[3:20:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> FINISH HER COMBO!
[3:20:36] <WarchiefGoldva> Once again, Pat picks the advice that's wrong.
[3:20:38] <StarkMaximum> As always, chat lying because for some reason Pat's fanbase is literally ignorant
[3:20:39] <%RushUnplugged> Pat just don't listen to chat, it's 3 fiesta
[3:20:40] <%torontototoro> what are penalties for losing a battle?
[3:20:43] <%floralkami> @ClairvoyantNara how'd you get that??
[3:20:44] <%ThePuddingDead> nah this game pisses save points
[3:20:44] <%bevyrage> it's not parrying, it's FULL TEAM BLOCKING
[3:20:45] <%Ninestempest> @Aydarkzero he respawned at hte save right next to them lol
[3:20:46] <%asmistake> EVERYTHING IS FINE, BLOCKING DOES NOT GIVE OR TAKE METER, LISTEN TO BIG BROTHER
[3:20:48] <+aslfrasle> Regular block takes meter, perfect guard builds meter
[3:20:52] <arkv01> yeah they should UBEREATS
[3:20:52] <%SolverCODO> 3333333
[3:20:56] <%chronotriggerhappy123> no penalties, you just go back to last check point/save
[3:20:56] <arkv01> use promo code moolie
[3:20:58] <jase__x> group blocking takes meter
[3:20:59] <%GabeSweetMan> Good healer!
[3:21:01] <Monkeyweed21> @torontototoro no penalty for losing
[3:21:03] <%PlagueOfGripes> she's the only reliable healer
[3:21:05] <cassiecagedd> I kept her in my party the entire game
[3:21:07] <%Mendin> ginseng is a good... ginseng
[3:21:07] <%torontototoro> gotcha, thanks
[3:21:10] <%LaughingCatt> the healers are all pretty neat
[3:21:11] <indig0bird> Bae-zing
[3:21:12] <%floralkami> I no
[3:21:12] <%asmistake> that quick restart is super nice
[3:21:13] <wookie5358> I'm more of a taurine person
[3:21:15] <beefcakemanthrob> ginseng is great
[3:21:15] <tri3dgE027> Wait a min...this ain't SkullGrills
[3:21:18] <%tizz86> @aydarkzero "game overs are a failure of game design"....
[3:21:19] <%floralkami> I know, right?
[3:21:22] <%californaya> then why the fuck does the meter go down when he's perfect blocking
[3:21:23] <joedatuous> thx morgana
[3:21:26] <+KingGoblodyte> Can you finish a combo with a super?
[3:21:26] <%PlagueOfGripes> all the other healers have weird gimmicks that make them really unreliable
[3:21:28] <WarchiefGoldva> Ginseng is maybe the best healer in the game? I mean, Thorani is amazing, but I don't know if I'd call her a better healer.
[3:21:29] <%chronotriggerhappy123> Thorani's 3 meter is a group heal over time
[3:21:29] <%asmistake> but having to make the trek back to the boss that killed you induces MUCH anger
[3:21:31] <$SvenHolgersson> LEG SHOOT
[3:21:34] <+DingusMcFadden> Holy shit, Pat is down with ginseng? Fuck me, his liver must be a BEAST ScaredyCat
[3:21:34] <Reaverund> Im glad this came finally came out and looks so good.
[3:21:36] <%Metballs> I run with Thorani, because best girl
[3:21:43] <%GabeSweetMan> Thorani is great but her healing is VERY unreliable.
[3:21:44] <Tucker0603> I think Dhar is a cool fighter

[3:23:48] <mrshazboto> TUNGAR'S THE BEST
[3:23:48] <cassiecagedd> BEST PARTY MEMBER IN THE GAME
[3:23:50] <%logoth_> Yet another character!
[3:23:51] <StarkMaximum> You can tell he's optional because he's not voice acted.
[3:23:52] <+DingusMcFadden> Physics Teachers HATE This 1 Simple Trick!
[3:23:52] <%asmistake> this guy is badass, and also hits multiple enemies
[3:23:53] <%thegreatestbambe> black pat
[3:23:53] <valriot> INDIAN PAT
[3:23:54] <$Big_King_Coconut> there chat he found tungar, you can stop freaking out
[3:23:54] <UnfilteredComic> Tungar is amazing
[3:23:54] <KZN02> To be fair, a lot of people wouldn’t on their first playthrough
[3:23:55] <%cvp5127> no voice for you
[3:23:55] <%GabeSweetMan> He has a legit Wario palette
[3:23:58] <%PlagueOfGripes> The game forgets Tungar exists and admits it later
[3:24:00] <+KingGoblodyte> THE DUDE ABIDES
[3:24:00] <%thegreatestbambe> dark pat
[3:24:08] <%marsano168> Tungar is the bees freaking knees
[3:24:10] <%DukeMoose> OH NO i big missed him :(
[3:24:11] <%GabeSweetMan> I'm sad Tungar isn't in any cutscenes.
[3:24:12] <%SilvaChariot0133> "..."
[3:24:16] <wookie5358> no voice actor. must not be important
[3:24:16] <+kylerqaz22> @plagueofgripes I mean, he is optional
[3:24:19] <StarkMaximum> That's the problem with optional characters
[3:24:21] <+Sulfur_Boride> It's Pat puling a Justin Trudeau kappa
[3:24:24] <StarkMaximum> Is they can't really factor into the story
[3:24:25] <arkv01> uh oh this guys coming in?
[3:24:25] <KZN02> (No time limit, so you could take your time)
[3:24:26] <+Sulfur_Boride> * Kappa
[3:24:26] <+MrSuplexArt> He's available later if you missed him
[3:24:27] <%ThePuddingDead> he does have a va but only in some cutscenes
[3:24:30] <arkv01> HES IN
[3:24:34] <$SvenHolgersson> Dhar gotta ruin the moment
[3:24:35] <Bryceanater> HES BROKEN
[3:24:35] <ExemplarKyle> Tungar is such a powerhouse.
[3:24:36] <%chronotriggerhappy123> Tungar is in cutscenes that involve one thick mama
[3:24:36] <cassiecagedd> HE IS AMAZING
[3:24:38] <+DingusMcFadden> Ok, so, are her shorts underwear, chat?

[3:25:19] <Aydarkzero> Kappa
[3:25:21] <arkv01> mikeZ is tungar?
[3:25:21] <%floralkami> @GrayMatterMiner Ravanavvaar pissed off a LOOOOOOT of people
[3:25:22] <+forlorncarton> wall just
[3:25:23] <%asmistake> just do a walljump
[3:25:23] <%sirisvirus> go through the tunnel
[3:25:24] <CrabSlacks> b-but... Razmi
[3:25:24] <Louie_Salmon> Walljumps
[3:25:25] <%Shadicara> Bow pat
[3:25:25] <+AWanderingKenku> I thought there were 32 including optional ones?
[3:25:25] <%tizz86> @dxlelouch24 Razmi is in my party 95%of the game
[3:25:25] <+forlorncarton> jump
[3:25:26] <%GabeSweetMan> Part are you okay
[3:25:26] <+HyperCharge_Sam> WALL JUMP PAT
[3:25:27] <%PlagueOfGripes> "avuncular" indicates an "uncle" like relationship. that is, an older person caring for unrelated younger people
[3:25:32] <+Grayhammatter> the fuck was that thing?
[3:25:34] <Bryceanater> @AngriestPat It gets wrose later
[3:25:36] <$Big_King_Coconut> pat forgot how to wall jump again
[3:25:39] <WarchiefGoldva> I love Nuna so much. Not the strongest, but she's amazing.
[3:25:43] <arkv01> avunckies
[3:25:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> BRUTE SMARTS
[3:25:44] <$SvenHolgersson> Part is never okay
[3:25:45] <%chronotriggerhappy123> jump and aim bow
[3:25:46] <%asmistake> or axe, axe DOES solve everything at least
[3:25:46] <UnfilteredComic> Part
[3:25:47] <+DingusMcFadden> What would be the point, @arkv01 ? The only underwear that would fit would be a thong.\
[3:25:52] <StarkMaximum> @WarchiefGoldva I just got Nuna, she's delightful
[3:25:55] <%GabeSweetMan> Down B for the best
[3:25:57] <lotharrio> @WarchiefGoldva But... she is one of the strongest. Trapping is great.
[3:25:59] <+emperri> an uncle is related plague
[3:26:00] <Klefth> Tungar is the shit
[3:26:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Partrick Boirvin
[3:26:05] <Louie_Salmon> Those moves all suck, down B is best forever
[3:26:07] <arkv01> @DingusMcFadden nah normal panties would still fit I think
[3:26:08] <TheZearGuy> Jumping is an overrated mechanic that will be phased out
[3:26:11] <$Dioliciouss> I hadn't realized this was a metroidvania
[3:26:16] <%asmistake> dude. 16 year old.
[3:26:17] <arkv01> @DingusMcFadden or thin loincloth
[3:26:18] <%Metballs> Imagine thinking Razmi is bad when Down into level 3 exists
[3:26:23] <Louie_Salmon> Or down A I suppose
[3:26:25] <StarkMaximum> MY EQUIPMENT

[3:26:42] <cassiecagedd> TUNGAR IS ALRIGHT
[3:26:42] <%Albadabar> Tungar is BIG AOE
[3:26:43] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Tungar's THE MAN!
[3:26:43] <Monkeyweed21> TUNGAR IS RAD
[3:26:44] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[3:26:44] <ItsAGundamu> Tungar does AMAZING DAMAGE
[3:26:45] <+RogueMinja> Tungar;s pretty good.
[3:26:46] <%depressed_skeleton> is that a fucking bendy sword?
[3:26:46] <%marsano168> He is in fact the best at what he does
[3:26:47] <lotharrio> Tungar was in my party like 80% of the game.
[3:26:47] <%asmistake> tungar is BIG STRONG
[3:26:49] <%arancet> its turban pat
[3:26:52] <%dekkitout> He sees like a hardy fellow
[3:26:52] <mrshazboto> Tungar and Zebe are COMBO GODS
[3:26:52] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, I come from the Democratic Debate to DEMAND ENTERTAINMENT!
[3:26:57] <WarchiefGoldva> Tungar's great.
[3:26:59] <%mistersups> mistersups subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Hi Pat. Inside the hyperbolic timechamber that is Gradschool! Having a great time, but I don't have a lot of time for streams. Pet the baby for me!
[3:26:59] <%sl8r4l8r> Tungar is my grandpa
[3:27:00] <heartbabe29> better than whatshername
[3:27:00] <UnfilteredComic> Sword Whip Turban is such a cool fucking concept
[3:27:02] <%moogleboy1984> he thought he peaked years ago, but, he'll return the favor
[3:27:04] <%GabeSweetMan> GO IN FOR COMBO
[3:27:07] <%chronotriggerhappy123> ARROWS PAT, ARROWS
[3:27:09] <%asmistake> who needs arrows when you have AXE JUMP
[3:27:15] <+SleazyShell> remember you have the bow for flying stuff
[3:27:17] <+DingusMcFadden> Male Pearl is weird
[3:27:19] <%GabeSweetMan> Nice parries!
[3:27:21] <%MakotoPB> flexible sword also makes a fashionable turban
[3:27:21] <+Sulfur_Boride> Chat, why did they not only put Pat in the game, but have him follow in Justin Trudeau's footsteps?
[3:27:25] <mrshazboto> @AngriestPat because they don't explain it to you - juggling enemies builds meter faster
[3:27:29] <SilverJakler> Pat give Elmo pets for me
[3:27:35] <%asmistake> it feels good to Daigo enemy multiattacks
[3:27:46] <%GabeSweetMan> Pat's getting really good at parry timing.
[3:27:47] <WarchiefGoldva> Tungar's lvl 3 is everything good.
[3:27:50] <+blitzrush1200> Diago moment
[3:27:53] <cassiecagedd> I think tungars down attack can hit air enemys
[3:27:53] <%asmistake> i'm just glad there's not up-blocks and down-blocks as well
[3:27:55] <%floralkami> Yoooo, Zeb fires using his whole damn body
[3:28:11] <+DingusMcFadden> A bow: the ultimate shield
[3:28:12] <%GabeSweetMan> He's super amazing.
[3:28:17] <Louie_Salmon> Long combos also, contrary to fighting games, make each hit STRONGER
[3:28:19] <garbageheaphound> fool
[3:28:21] <%Shadicara> LUL
[3:28:22] <%floralkami> FRAMES
[3:28:24] <Aydarkzero> oh...
[3:28:24] <%logoth_> elmo take over
[3:28:25] <StarkMaximum> I love when you win with Tungar's neutral and the win screen freezes on him drawn with three arms to evoke movement
[3:28:25] <%corepool> hubris

[3:30:21] <star_feline> @WarchiefGoldva WutFace
[3:30:25] <%tizz86> i like nuna
[3:30:27] <%asmistake> I can't for the LIFE of me figure out Phoebe's 1-meter
[3:30:27] <ClairvoyantNara> I like Yan, Ginsing, Nuna
[3:30:27] <%GabeSweetMan> I think she's the best character in the game because she can INTERRUPT.
[3:30:28] <WarchiefGoldva> I love Nuna, she's the best.
[3:30:30] <%Charuzu> god dammit Warchief
[3:30:30] <StarkMaximum> i literally just realized Pat left to take a piss after cooing over Elmo and Elmo in this BRB screen is labeled PEEPEE
[3:30:34] <%floralkami> @WarchiefGoldva i.... Oh god
[3:30:36] <StarkMaximum> @GabeSweetMan Nuna raw
[3:30:37] <$Big_King_Coconut> seems good but I don't use her @GabeSweetMan

[3:30:38] <%ThePuddingDead> @tizz86 kampan, sharktooth sword girl, razmi
[3:30:42] <%Metballs> Nuna's a laugh, I can see she has stuff, but don't want to swap anyone out for her
[3:30:44] <%tizz86> Razmi, Kampan and Nuna for me
[3:30:51] <StarkMaximum> They hated Warchief because he asked the hard questions
[3:30:57] <%GabeSweetMan> I wish more of the strategy was involved in interrupting enemy attacks.
[3:30:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> Elmo has a box cutter in the brb video

[3:32:33] <mrshazboto> @AngriestPat legit sorry that your first experience with this game is people yelling at you that you're doing it wrong right after you took a week off. Enjoying the stream so far and hope the faceless entity that is chat doesn't sour the game for you.

[3:33:56] <%GunEden> dhar>zebei
[3:33:58] <+Maleicus> aha nothing
[3:33:58] <Bryceanater> @AngriestPat For some reaosn Tungar has a voice but he doesnt talk until 75% of the game
[3:33:59] <%asmistake> welcome back to pleb gravity
[3:33:59] <+Ziryuri> The feel of being covered in piss LUL ??? Wha
[3:34:04] <%king_wragles> LUL
[3:34:07] <%chronotriggerhappy123> Quadira is cool, she does CHARGING STAR
[3:34:10] <$Big_King_Coconut> Dhar is strong as hell tho
[3:34:11] <%GabeSweetMan> Don't worry, Dhar gets better.
[3:34:12] <%Mrbaconator> dhars a fuck
[3:34:13] <%Cervarian> But Dhar is #BestBoy danCry
[3:34:16] <ty7erzer0> LUL

[3:34:26] <cassiecagedd> bad boy go to hell
[3:34:26] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> isn't it great how they made a character just for you to call a bitch?
[3:34:27] <jase__x> lol everyone agrees fuck dahr
[3:34:27] <StarkMaximum> @Bryceanater It's because Tungar's optional so he can't really factor into story scenes, because they wouldn't make sense if you didn't get him
[3:34:28] <%GabeSweetMan> Smart
[3:34:29] <+blitzrush1200> but he a strong
[3:34:30] <Coystick> but is Dhar a good bitch?
[3:34:30] <%asmistake> ugh, i can't imagine the poor baby coated in cat piss
[3:34:33] <DXLelouch24> SHES GOT CAP AMERICA SHIT?
[3:34:34] <%GabeSweetMan> lol
[3:34:34] <mrshazboto> Dhar is the sweetest boy though
[3:34:35] <Zalthia> How dare you Pat! Dhar is my son!!!
[3:34:38] <Ids560> I thought LB+RB was the best healer
[3:34:45] <ExemplarKyle> I hate Dhar, but he does iai draws/strikes, so I'm obliged to like him.
[3:34:49] <%GabeSweetMan> @Ids560 You're not WRONG.
[3:34:50] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @DXLelouch24 yeah, her level 3 is just a massive charging star and she uses a shield as a weapon
[3:34:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> @ThePuddingDead Just cause it's in some misguided 'good fath' doesn't mean hollering 'you're doing it wrong' is right.
[3:34:55] <lotharrio> You can quick-tap the aim button to fire off in a straight line, Pat.
[3:34:57] <joedatuous> Dhar murdered a man in cold blood
[3:35:00] <cassiecagedd> later party members are way better then dhar hell tungar is better then dhar
[3:35:02] <joedatuous> what a fucking monster
[3:35:08] <%asmistake> it can, it just hasn't?
[3:35:11] <%asmistake> oh, there it goes
[3:35:11] <%logoth_> my armor
[3:35:12] <%Mendin> Considering all th e fire it probably was lukewarm blood
[3:35:16] <StarkMaximum> "Honey, duck!"
[3:35:18] <Zalthia> Aren’t we killing people right now?
[3:35:19] <%Big_Dream> you think pat actually cares
[3:35:25] <%Big_Dream> thats the joke
[3:35:26] <DXLelouch24> nah thats a robot
[3:35:27] <%asmistake> i like how Tungar's turban is a whipsword
[3:35:29] <DXLelouch24> FUCK IT
[3:35:37] <%Metballs> I love my dumb murder boyfriend, Dhar
[3:35:38] <Zalthia> What about all the soldiers we killed?
[3:35:43] <DXLelouch24> their evil
[3:35:45] <DXLelouch24> FUCK EM
[3:35:46] <%Metballs> He good boi
[3:35:51] <%asmistake> dhar and zebei are in the Bad section
[3:35:53] <Monkeyweed21> thats where you came from
[3:35:55] <%InugamiTheHound> was that troy baker? travis talking?
[3:35:57] <identitycrisis> Dude. You might be the most adorable streamer on twitch. No fuckin joke haha.
[3:36:02] <DXLelouch24> dude Rav is SUPER FUCKIN EVIL
[3:36:03] <joedatuous> Dhar plays fortnite
[3:36:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> elevator, Pat
[3:36:09] <Zalthia> Dhar is a child soldier
[3:36:09] <cassiecagedd> @asmistake !00% for sure
[3:36:10] <DXLelouch24> those soldiers had to go
[3:36:11] <%floralkami> @joedatuous it wasn't cold, he did comment on Ajna's father's bravery and leadership while fighting hi
[3:36:13] <Monkeyweed21> thats where you came from pat
[3:36:13] <+SirRazzle> How'd you use the bow in combat?
[3:36:14] <%chronotriggerhappy123> Zebei is played by Matt Mercer
[3:36:14] <%asmistake> no, the guy is streaming, Elmo's just watching
[3:36:15] <%broth_elemental> Chat is literally saying "You don't pay my sub"
[3:36:17] <+temporal_zenith> @Zalthia They had 3 degrees of separation from Dhar so no one likes them
[3:36:17] <star_feline> Man this fortress sure falls forever
[3:36:18] <+KingGoblodyte> nothing there...
[3:36:26] <%floralkami> @Zalthia sshhh
[3:36:31] <joedatuous> its really high up..
[3:36:32] <%asmistake> man, at least this song SLAPS
[3:36:32] <Monkeyweed21> go right Cumo
[3:36:32] <ItsAGundamu> Litterally a wall
[3:36:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> He said a little while ago that everyone telling him he was doing it wrong when the instructions weren't making sense was making it hard for him to play the game
[3:36:36] <%transporterthesequel> Yeah that's fine but he MURDERED YOUR DAD AND BURNED DOWN A VILLAGE
[3:36:37] <%GabeSweetMan> Don't worry, the Flat earth won't catch us any time soon.
[3:36:41] <WarchiefGoldva> @star_feline Gravity is relative.
[3:36:44] <Zalthia> DHAR IS MY SON
[3:36:46] <StarkMaximum> @AngriestPat If you need to move the map to study it, there's a Map option in the pause menu that lets you move it around
[3:36:51] <cassiecagedd> you do have to go that way
[3:36:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> Sounds like he cares to me. But that's just my opinion.
[3:36:55] <%tizz86> just realized, is this the only area you can't return to?
[3:36:57] <cassiecagedd> just gotta be fast
[3:37:04] <%chronotriggerhappy123> yes
[3:37:04] <BlindGato> How long have we been falling for?
[3:37:07] <%Metballs> Wait, you can get the map from the menu?
[3:37:08] <lotharrio> The meditate button can zoom out the map while you're holding up.
[3:37:09] <StarkMaximum> i helped.
[3:37:09] <%Metballs> Holy shit
[3:37:11] <DXLelouch24> cassie stop tellin lies
[3:37:14] <%chronotriggerhappy123> the fortress is the only place you cant come back too
[3:37:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I love Dhar. He's a good boy, just misled is all.
[3:37:16] <%asmistake> i think you just gotta tank the hits and be faster than the galick gun
[3:37:17] <Zalthia> We fall at the speed of plot
[3:37:20] <%Metballs> That makes it not the worst map ever now
[3:37:22] <%asmistake> Oh
[3:37:30] <star_feline> @WarchiefGoldva This game doesn't believe in gravity
[3:37:31] <%asmistake> I'm bad and wrong
[3:37:42] <heartbabe29> is this the new prince of persia
[3:37:51] <StarkMaximum> @Metballs I think I only just figured that out on my third or fourth stream of the game and I spent a few minutes just sitting there shouting about how it changes everything
[3:37:59] <WorldFapRevealed> everything about this game looks really bad
[3:38:02] <%tizz86> @chronotriggerhappy123 i completely forgot about it until earlier. started working on endgame quests last night
[3:38:04] <StarkMaximum> she did it! good job ginseng.
[3:38:08] <Zalthia> Wait guys I need to know- where do you get the dog? I’m at Serpent Queen I haven’t gotten him yet :(
[3:38:16] <StarkMaximum> @WorldFapRevealed Everything about you and your name looks really bad.
[3:38:17] <%GabeSweetMan> Don't feed the troll.
[3:38:23] <NeroInfinite> You mean Roti?
[3:38:24] <%Mendin> @Zalthia Later.
[3:38:24] <+RogueMinja> Remember that Tungar has AOE on his down.
[3:38:25] <+emperri> mhm mhm mhm
[3:38:30] <Monkeyweed21> Make Dhar fight Ravannavar
[3:38:32] <%tizz86> @zalthia keep going
[3:38:33] <lotharrio> @Zalthia He's after the chakra gates.
[3:38:34] <%TheQButton> I love how this character just throws random shit at people.
[3:38:35] <%Rlexp> Is that troy baker?
[3:38:35] <%Mendin> The dog is hard to miss, don't worry
[3:38:37] <mrshazboto> @Zalthia you're close.
[3:38:51] <Zalthia> There’s more after the chakra gates??? I thought it was half way!
[3:38:53] <Monkeyweed21> dog is mandatory
[3:38:56] <Bladeexe> Just how high was this thing? Felt like it should have crashed by now.
[3:38:57] <StarkMaximum> oof
[3:38:58] <%AbnormalVoid> This palace sure is up high
[3:38:58] <lol_red_ranger> doin it doin it doin it well
[3:39:03] <%chronotriggerhappy123> Electro doggo best doggo
[3:39:09] <%GabeSweetMan> Tungar's down is AMAZING for AoE.
[3:39:09] <%chronotriggerhappy123> Lanshi
[3:39:11] <Zalthia> Oh thank goodness doggo is mandatory thanks guys <3
[3:39:12] <StarkMaximum> Does anyone know what Tungar is saying during his AOE?
[3:39:15] <%Metballs> You CAN pet the dog
[3:39:25] <StarkMaximum> i just keep hearing "I'VE got to--DIIIIIE"
[3:39:28] <%chronotriggerhappy123> Petting the dog is a vital step in his combos
[3:39:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> MIKE WHITMAN
[3:39:38] <%SolverCODO> lol
[3:39:39] <%GabeSweetMan> Reinforcements.

[3:39:48] <%Metballs> Get ready for that ADVANCED DOG PETTING
[3:39:55] <+SirRazzle> How's he doing the bow moves with Ajna? I didn't know those exist.
[3:39:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ginsing is saying "My equipment!"
[3:39:57] <WarchiefGoldva> One of the dog's moves is literally called "You can pet the dog".
[3:39:58] <Tsarwerewolf> I really want it thats why I ask
[3:40:03] <ItsAGundamu> use your meter pat
[3:40:07] <%Rlexp> Oh ok thanks @TheQButton
[3:40:10] <%chronotriggerhappy123> also you can pet the dog MORE
[3:40:19] <+emperri> was that
[3:40:20] <marvel877> But what if he needs the meter later???
[3:40:20] <NeroInfinite> use the mixing move more often to get bigger heals
[3:40:23] <$Big_King_Coconut> omae wa mou, shindeiru
[3:40:23] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Did he just Kenshiro him?
[3:40:27] <%StaceMcGate> @SirRazzle Each time Ajna gets a new weapon her moveset changes.
[3:40:38] <%tizz86> too bad doggo is male. plague would've had to make another Petterz
[3:40:39] <Monkeyweed21> you aint seen shit
[3:40:40] <StarkMaximum> big complicates
[3:40:41] <lotharrio> Big strong complicated.
[3:40:41] <marvel877> No, its not
[3:40:48] <%ThePuddingDead> fuggin brace then since it's gonna get MUCH more complicated later
[3:40:52] <%GabeSweetMan> Tungar's Down builds up a LOT of meter.
[3:40:53] <%asmistake> WE HIT EVERYTHING, GINSENG
[3:40:55] <star_feline> BORING
[3:41:02] <%Mendin> Time to meet Lord Rhubarbadopalous
[3:41:03] <StarkMaximum> Time to beat the game!
[3:41:03] <WarchiefGoldva> Don't you love it when Tiny Little Adiantum gets reappropriated as some other guy's shitty remix?
[3:41:04] <cassiecagedd> I know right?
[3:41:06] <%chronotriggerhappy123> just get thorani and use her level 3 heals (press the button 3 times while meter burning

[3:43:41] <%TheQButton> He has a flash kick!
[3:43:41] <DracaenaLeaf> Weak King

[3:44:03] <+Estuko> PooowwweerrrRRR
[3:44:06] <Mr_Strut> Why is the healer in front?
[3:44:06] <+DoggyT> No, that was a SHUMMAHSAULT.
[3:44:08] <%Faustgesicht> I better see 9 more heads on this guy by game's end
[3:44:09] <%SolverCODO> Throw an empty blue barrel at him, that'll kill him in one hit
[3:44:13] <%Shadicara> Fighting for klingon honor here pat
[3:44:15] <T_Sasquatch> Kinda kicking his ass
[3:44:18] <Mr_Strut> Or does party order not matter?
[3:44:20] <mrshazboto> Eyyyy, now you're getting the hang of the combo system <3
[3:44:20] <+emperri> Jebaited
[3:44:22] <%tizz86> he's finally combo juggling
[3:44:26] <CrabSlacks> cowarding out
[3:44:28] <majindusto> That's a Huge Bitch
[3:44:30] <%chronotriggerhappy123> boss sending out some minion
[3:44:31] <star_feline> 3 people avenging their tribes and a botanist child, what a party
[3:44:31] <lotharrio> That's the bread and butter for Tungar. Up, down, down. So much iddhi, so much damage.
[3:44:32] <SGrim> This sword man has some Sikh moves KKone
[3:44:37] <+RealPT1> spend that meter
[3:44:39] <%StaceMcGate> @Mr_Strut It matters for some characters like Thorani
[3:44:40] <%GabeSweetMan> PAT you keep not finishing Ajna's combo.....
[3:44:41] <+KingGoblodyte> Use more super
[3:44:43] <StarkMaximum> @star_feline Ginseng be like "I'm just happy to be here!"
[3:44:50] <goddamndavid> is that Sinistar?
[3:44:51] <%Mendin> SGrim, nice
[3:44:51] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @Mr_Strut party order does matter to some characters.
[3:44:51] <%asmistake> Bananabar's got pointy-ass shoes
[3:44:59] <mrshazboto> @Mr_Strut party order matters a bit and I don't thinkg pat has realized that there's a setting to put one character always in front and one character always in back
[3:45:02] <%Shadicara> What if he needs the meter for later Kappa
[3:45:07] <+Keith_e> @Mr_Strut its because the side the boss appeared on the party faces the same way
[3:45:08] <+rdark_ksu> wtf was that
[3:45:10] <cassiecagedd> Party order doesnt matter much. I personly keep low HP units on the sides so that a attack that hits 2 mid characters its less likely to hit say gin
[3:45:13] <StarkMaximum> oh your music was so shitty it hurt me ravannavar
[3:45:15] <%GabeSweetMan> Bard motherfucker
[3:45:18] <televisedrevolting> BARD BULLSHIT

[3:45:21] <arkv01> sono chikara wo MISETE KURE

[3:45:28] <joedatuous> cutting words!
[3:45:29] <cassiecagedd> LIK THAT ONE
[3:45:31] <+DoggyT> Ravan has DOOT powers!
[3:45:38] <%StaceMcGate> It's funny the more meter you get, the biggest disadvantage you at later in game. You need a full bar to revive dead party members
[3:45:42] <+rdark_ksu> so when you block are you supposed to hold the button or not?
[3:45:50] <Pairoschuz> Anyway here's wonderwall
[3:45:50] <benjiFG> shcum
[3:45:51] <bear_breaker20> rember that time michael dorf did a Flash Kick? rember?

[3:50:18] <%moogleboy1984> If Naka had a full grown Pidgeotto
[3:50:19] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Kushi is really complicated so good luck
[3:50:20] <arkv01> hell yeah I love nakoruru!
[3:50:21] <%asmistake> zebei sucks tho
[3:50:23] <lotharrio> @BigBech Stygian
[3:50:25] <%californaya> Rock and Roll Kushi Koo
[3:50:26] <star_feline> Coochie?
[3:50:27] <%Mendin> Some people dont have supers, yeah
[3:50:30] <BigBech> thanks
[3:50:31] <+StrawberryPantsu> Coochie
[3:50:32] <Run44forrest> coochie?
[3:50:34] <Coystick> SHUT UP DHAR
[3:50:35] <COMB711> Kushi is a hard character to play
[3:50:38] <$Big_King_Coconut> She's not that confusing, she's a dragoon
[3:50:39] <PkSilent01> canned Coochie
[3:50:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> HAH
[3:50:43] <joedatuous> free coochie
[3:50:43] <StarkMaximum> @BigBech *** Here's his stream vod for that game
[3:50:46] <arkv01> she saved me... but now I must live in her head forever
[3:50:47] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> She looks like she should protest for Hong Kong.
[3:50:52] <lennyrager> Is that dva?
[3:50:55] <%fazoburquina> LUL
[3:50:55] <+blitzrush1200> backdown
[3:50:56] <Pat_Squared> down bird attack is real good
[3:50:58] <chromatic_shadow> LUL
[3:50:58] <StarkMaximum> "Oh, that I will not do. Good day." What a good fucking line
[3:50:59] <ItsAGundamu> bitch i'm out
[3:50:59] <star_feline> BIG COWARD
[3:51:00] <+RogueMinja> Just use Kushi's down attack.
[3:51:00] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @StaceMcGate her up attack makes her fly with atune, her attacks get strong burt she cant block, then you can use up attack again to do dragoon jumps basically that deal more damage based on how many attacks you press, but her attacks regen slower while flying
[3:51:00] <T_Sasquatch> Lmao
[3:51:00] <%mistersups> Kushi is Haru!
[3:51:02] <%Gogogolem> Its sacred he can't go.
[3:51:04] <%LaughingCatt> Coward out!
[3:51:04] <%tizz86> Kushi is one of my least used
[3:51:04] <Run44forrest> what
[3:51:05] <zazzera01> Is that Mercer
[3:51:05] <%Metballs> Fuck Zebei
[3:51:06] <+rdark_ksu> oh nvm goodbye
[3:51:07] <Aydarkzero> welp cya!
[3:51:08] <%StaceMcGate> Is Kushi tibetan or nepalian?
[3:51:11] <lotharrio> Kushi is easy. Just send the bird out to attack, or go flying, scream, then crash the bird.
[3:51:14] <televisedrevolting> Is that Marianne?
[3:51:16] <Bladeexe> I'm sure it would be allowed if it means beating that jerk
[3:51:16] <+D00msDayDan> well then you better figure out how to get out of her brain
[3:51:18] <jase__x> man fuck zebei
[3:51:21] <%TheAsianAvenger96> just like usopp
[3:51:25] <%mistersups> @zazzera01 Zebei is Mercer
[3:51:27] <+Estuko> See you later then Fugo I mean Zebei
[3:51:32] <%DukeMoose> Zebri has NO HONOR
[3:51:36] <ExemplarKyle> Sumeru is sacred. "But there's monsters up there-" SUMERU IS SACRED.
[3:51:40] <%StaceMcGate> Zebei is the biggest complainer in the game
[3:51:42] <+blitzrush1200> forget your culture
[3:51:43] <%asmistake> Zebei sucks like Usopp, not cool and honorable like Sogeking
[3:51:44] <%moogleboy1984> I want Zebei to stab my fupa with his nose
[3:51:45] <%king_wragles> I'm kinda sad this isn't a full on anime
[3:51:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> soooo sacred
[3:51:57] <@lewdskeletor13> Everytime Dhar is onscreen, all the characters should be saying “Fuck Dhar”
[3:52:08] <+Papafleish> zebei is right when he complains anja is such a dumbass
[3:52:11] <%StaceMcGate> Dhar did nothing wrong
[3:52:12] <StarkMaximum> Ajna your party has used all their abilities, you need a long rest to restore your Hit Dice
[3:52:12] <+kylerqaz22> Zebei did nothing wrong all of you are emotional children lol
[3:52:16] <+DoggyT> Bad sign when youa gree with Dhar...
[3:52:19] <%Shadicara> Can't believe you have to fight worf to regain your honor
[3:52:20] <%tizz86> so much time is spent in Sumeru. I wish they added one or two more locations
[3:52:20] <T_Sasquatch> @moogleboy1984 👀
[3:52:22] <Run44forrest> DHAR KILLED HER DAD
[3:52:22] <arkv01> yeah shhhh big crimes no snitch
[3:52:26] <%GabeSweetMan> What the hell is up with the Zebei hate?
[3:52:26] <+StrawberryPantsu> As much as I love Cassandra Lee Morris, I hate hearing her in EVERYTHING
[3:52:26] <star_feline> Shut up Zebei we are on revenge
[3:52:28] <%PlagueOfGripes> Ajna gets stupider as the game goes on
[3:52:31] <%asmistake> Oh, I'm not arguing that Ajna is a dumbass, but Zebei is bad
[3:52:32] <$Big_King_Coconut> I will spring the trap WITH MY FACE
[3:52:34] <%ThePuddingDead> i...HATE sumeru and the platforms there
[3:52:35] <arkv01> what does that even MEAN
[3:52:36] <mrshazboto> Bird girl is HARD to use
[3:52:38] <mercado94> Some sort of X blade
[3:52:38] <arkv01> can you actually release them
[3:52:45] <SGrim> "Trap or not, I'm getting mine!" I agree Ajna!
[3:52:49] <nuane> the evil!
[3:52:51] <%cvp5127> VORE HER
[3:52:52] <%dekkitout> We talking Goku stupider or Naruto stupider?
[3:52:52] <majindusto> Kushi is voiced by the same actress as Haru from Persona 5
[3:52:52] <arkv01> NO DONT
[3:52:53] <Coylie3> Its more than just a mountain
[3:52:53] <a_mad_dragon> gorons
[3:52:54] <StarkMaximum> voip
[3:52:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> Naraka? Even more Asura's Wrath Buddhism stuff!
[3:52:54] <%LaughingCatt> FAT evil
[3:52:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Nah, fuck Zebei, preemptively fuck him.
[3:52:56] <%GabeSweetMan> DELICIOUS
[3:52:57] <Bladeexe> Protect it from polution of course.

[3:52:58] <lotharrio> It's a magical, Olympus style mountain, Pat.
[3:52:59] <star_feline> Pat you just fucking blew a city into a mountain
[3:53:00] <%transporterthesequel> Ajna just did. With a FLYING CASTLE
[3:53:01] <Run44forrest> plot
[3:53:01] <Aydarkzero> man you just get a ton of new team members
[3:53:01] <%ThePuddingDead> now this is straight up kidnapping people
[3:53:01] <StarkMaximum> DON'T LOSE YOUR WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
[3:53:03] <%depressed_skeleton> succ
[3:53:04] <This_is_Marco> imprison her forever yea!
[3:53:05] <%sl8r4l8r> I WANNA ROC
[3:53:05] <%chronotriggerhappy123> bird girl also has no supers, she doesnt use super meter but instead changes states
[3:53:05] <+rdark_ksu> she is just mind voring ppl
[3:53:06] <%TheMattman1313> I dunno maybe YOU AFTER YOU CRASHED A CASTLE ON IT
[3:53:06] <+blitzrush1200> not consent
[3:53:06] <+temporal_zenith> @AngriestPat Please refer to the mountain the fortress just crashed into
[3:53:08] <wookie5358> won't be the first time this game was absurd
[3:53:08] <joedatuous> is that mei?
[3:53:09] <KaliasTV> That's gotta be a crime
[3:53:09] <NeroInfinite> @AngriestPat You crashed a fortress into a mountain
[3:53:10] <%StaceMcGate> @dekkitout Goku stupid, Ajna is responsible for all the evil in this game
[3:53:11] <wookie5358> death to mountains!
[3:53:11] <vonmaultke> IT JUST BLEW UP PAT
[3:53:11] <%GabeSweetMan> Again, really NEED a move list.
[3:53:13] <garbageheaphound> OH BOY
[3:53:13] <%Piemen99> @AngriestPat A GIANT FLOATING FORTRESS
[3:53:13] <Pat_Squared> Zebei is kinfa annoying now but Ajna takes that from him for a good chunk of the game
[3:53:14] <%Tearonex> REVENGE FIRST SAFETY SECOND
[3:53:15] <mrshazboto> Important - KUSHI CANNOT BLOCK WHILE FLYING
[3:53:16] <%Shadicara> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[3:53:17] <Run44forrest> coochie on my mind
[3:53:17] <+Papafleish> zebei is great one of my problems with this game is anja doesn't get held to the fire for her dumbassness
[3:53:22] <+Vex831> dragoon
[3:53:24] <%LaughingCatt> she's kinda like a Dragoon
[3:53:27] <garbageheaphound> use Dhar some more
[3:53:30] <%Albadabar> UH OH
[3:53:30] <nuane> anja just kidnapped a child
[3:53:32] <heartlesshealer> so this kind of teaches you what Ajna's been doing with her bow and axe attack sets
[3:53:32] <+rdark_ksu> roti
[3:53:33] <star_feline> Not giseng BibleThump
[3:53:33] <%PlagueOfGripes> she's not as complicated as they make her out to be
[3:53:36] <cassiecagedd> Dhar sucks tho
[3:53:37] <%tizz86> @plagueofgripes i really disliked her at the 50% point before her realization
[3:53:38] <cassiecagedd> and uh
[3:53:39] <StarkMaximum> Kushi is not in any way a child
[3:53:42] <%GabeSweetMan> @LaughingCatt That's actually kinda accurate.
[3:53:42] <%DukeMoose> but Altun can be safe from some low ground attacks!
[3:53:43] <cassiecagedd> is bad to invest in for REASONS
[3:53:44] <%king_wragles> Did Roti change color?
[3:53:45] <%ThePuddingDead> @Papafleish you're not wrong, act 2 is rough to play through
[3:53:45] <%InugamiTheHound> what is that cute thing following her?
[3:53:46] <Run44forrest> fuck dhar his attacks are cool tho
[3:53:46] <+blitzrush1200> yeah everyone should've actually roasted her more
[3:53:48] <mothdude> Zebei is annoying but I like that there is party conflict.
[3:53:50] <$Big_King_Coconut> hey guys it's Plague
[3:53:51] <%StaceMcGate> Zebei is the least useful character in the game
[3:53:51] <Sokumotanaka> pat doesn't cared about sacred land like a white person confirmed
[3:53:53] <%Metballs> Dhar hits like a freight train with positive affinity
[3:53:54] <joedatuous> something about this music is so nice
[3:53:54] <DracaenaLeaf> Elmo is cute
[3:54:00] <marvel877> she's pretty simple. I use the bard character more than her.
[3:54:05] <WarchiefGoldva> She's not complicated at all. She's fine. her grounded D+A is powerful as fuck, Altun kicks ass.
[3:54:05] <@lewdskeletor13> Elmo is very cute
[3:54:06] <%GabeSweetMan> No keep going. RORB
[3:54:07] <vonmaultke> Dhar may suck but is he wrong? pvpSass
[3:54:08] <+kylerqaz22> @cassiecagedd Shut it
[3:54:13] <nuane> @StarkMaximum Kushi is child coded
[3:54:13] <%GabeSweetMan> yeyeye
[3:54:13] <%ThePuddingDead> wait for it
[3:54:13] <%Tearonex> no healing, huh pat?
[3:54:13] <Monkeyweed21> Right is the right way
[3:54:14] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @InugamiTheHound that is Roti, a tapir and a preorder/ backer reward
[3:54:15] <%floralkami> Did roti change color?
[3:54:15] <%asmistake> when you get more attacks, Dhar becomes so much more useful
[3:54:16] <cassiecagedd> I do what i want
[3:54:20] <DigbyMayor> Left is ringsel right is progress
[3:54:21] <NinjaRed2600> Man that gameplay did not grab me at all.
[3:54:22] <joedatuous> Dhar gives the succ
[3:54:23] <%StaceMcGate> I wanted to like Baohzi, but she has a very limited moveset
[3:54:24] <%asmistake> charge charge charge SUPER
[3:54:27] <T_Sasquatch> "sacred " land
[3:54:29] <%noobpsyboticus> #Dhardidnothingwrong
[3:54:31] <lotharrio> Nice.
[3:54:38] <NinjaRed2600> This level design looks so bland and empty
[3:54:38] <This_is_Marco> galaxy brained
[3:54:39] <cassiecagedd> He did everything wrong
[3:54:40] <+Papafleish> I played tales of abyss before this game and the way they treat their flawed protags looks bad for Anja
[3:54:42] <%Metballs> Yeah, I'm disappopinted by Baozhai
[3:54:44] <%LaughingCatt> But you are too baby to progress farther
[3:54:45] <%Gogogolem> I see alot of Dhar apologist in this chat
[3:54:46] <%Mendin> and 2 hours in he finally finds the dash button
[3:54:46] <+StrawberryPantsu> "Patrick your genius is showing"
[3:54:49] <%transporterthesequel> Dhar literally did everything wrong
[3:54:53] <%tizz86> @metballs ride that dmg while it's there
[3:54:53] <%InugamiTheHound> @chronotriggerhappy123 aww man, He's so cute and awesome
[3:54:54] <wookie5358> went left instead of right. genius confirmed
[3:54:55] <star_feline> Dhar apologist go home
[3:54:58] <xIgnitionCrowx> Consign yourself to your fate.
[3:54:59] <WarchiefGoldva> Dhar couldn't have done things more wrong.
[3:55:00] <%StaceMcGate> Dhar has the best character growth in this game
[3:55:01] <%Kirby_Sauce> talk to her
[3:55:02] <cassiecagedd> Baoziah is good tho
[3:55:02] <mothdude> Baohzi would be way more fun if stealing coins did damage.
[3:55:03] <%sl8r4l8r> COUNTAHH
[3:55:06] <Coystick> big bird
[3:55:06] <vonmaultke> Dhar did nothing wrong Keepo
[3:55:09] <MasterDecoder> Dhar > Zebei
[3:55:09] <%ThePuddingDead> god this chat cracks me up with that shit XD
[3:55:12] <%chronotriggerhappy123> Bhaozai is good as a combo ENDER, but never open with her up b or you hurt your own team
[3:55:13] <garbageheaphound> maybe check out your inner world
[3:55:20] <reonome> i like dhar because he is hot Kappa
[3:55:23] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Well!

[3:55:39] <%Tearonex> I just got to the part where I'm not liking Zebei
[3:55:40] <%dekkitout> Dhar is a jackass who I empathize with SeriousSloth
[3:55:40] <lotharrio> Flying is a slower recharge.
[3:55:41] <%chronotriggerhappy123> yeah, as bird mode she cant block
[3:55:41] <%tizz86> @chronotriggerhappy123 yeah, her mechanic is strange
[3:55:42] <Coylie3> I want a pet bird as big as Altun
[3:55:43] <$Big_King_Coconut> her turns build slowly when she's flying
[3:55:43] <This_is_Marco> thats a big birb
[3:55:43] <@lewdskeletor13> The bird takes up so much of the screen Jesus
[3:55:44] <+Papafleish> but people in game talk about how Dhar sucks
[3:55:44] <+KingGoblodyte> DID THAT BIRD JUST DAB?
