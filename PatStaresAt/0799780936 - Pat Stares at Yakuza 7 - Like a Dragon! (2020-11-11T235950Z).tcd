[0:06:32] <+michingmallecho> hasL
[0:06:35] <%T_Sasquatch> he is NOT as cool as kiryu
[0:06:39] <$Futurecity10> Anyone tell pat ichiban is voiced by nishiki
[0:06:43] <%KineKithZen> Why does Ichiban not have a Kirin sponsorship
[0:06:45] <%lil_pudintater9> @BallerSwagBro9k Childe went so hard
[0:06:52] <%Nekros4442> He isnt cool, He's far more endearing
[0:06:53] <+tigerfang86> ok not as cool as kiryu YET
[0:07:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @lil_pudintater9 Right? LUL And hes only the 2ND STORY BOSS
[0:07:17] <+squidlord482> So is it dubbed or subbed?
[0:07:20] <+michingmallecho> ichiban is the loveable idiot who’ll try to not let you down hasL
[0:07:21] <Blank9> ichiban's only voiced by nishiki in japanese
[0:07:24] <+dmtjinni> Guess Who is With Pat Today? Elmo? ZanZan? Paige?
[0:07:26] <heart_ablaze> @t_sasquatch no, but he does have ALOT more charisma

[0:07:56] <%T_Sasquatch> Ichiban is a good boy
[0:08:13] <%T_Sasquatch> Kiryu is basically a demi god
[0:08:15] <%lemon_rinds> @futurecity10 That is there perfect way to describe kiryu
[0:08:16] <%Nekros4442> I mean there's a reason why Ichiban's suit looks so similar to Nishiki's from 0

The driver wasn't paying attention and stopped at the red. The guys walked on the middle of the street, one reaching into his pants to grab a gun. (part 1)

[0:33:22] <+Mitchellsocks> I’m literally basing all my 6 opinions off of finishing your playthrough the other day!
[0:33:23] <+Jakeofalco> why is 1 bad ?
[0:33:23] <%Captainahab_37> 0, K2, 5, and 4 are objectively correct
[0:33:27] <+dayz1003> @dabeaminator it aged really bad
[0:33:27] <%QueequegTheater> @dabeaminator kind of a filler episode
[0:33:28] <%baronblank> are 3 and 6 just bad or what
[0:33:28] <%snugglepuggs> sure skip the game that INTRODUCES main characters

[0:33:43] <thelonechris> Heresy D:
[0:33:45] <RetributionP> 2's construction game killed me
[0:33:46] <%Kataguro> I'm glad I'm not alone in this
[0:33:46] <%McSoliace> i feel that
[0:33:46] <%T_Sasquatch> You guys are crazy
[0:33:47] <%Leftovermemes> 4's characters are great, but 4 's story is so fucking stupid
[0:33:47] <%Mr_Pylon> Kiryu is just a weird monolith man
[0:33:49] <+Dalevich> @peachsaliva ah, cool. I've missed that fuzzy maniac (Elmo)
[0:33:50] <%T_Sasquatch> ONE GAME
[0:33:51] <%SvenHolgersson> Kiryu is a genius in comparison
[0:33:51] <+skyheys> @mordoprime Zombie game is good but has bad performance
[0:33:52] <+Interface23> 3 was gutted until the remastered
[0:33:53] <heart_ablaze> still like majima over both
[0:33:54] <+Mitchellsocks> Kiwami 2 is really good but linda sleeper in some ways, felt fleeting
[0:33:58] <%BoxNavy> hes jotaro basically.
[0:33:58] <%T_Sasquatch> until he is not
[0:33:59] <Broken_Sonex> Kiryu is a buzzkill
[0:34:01] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Kiryu is larger than life, Ichiban is a human being
[0:34:03] <danielm427> jotaro and jouske
[0:34:03] <%BoxNavy> Just Cool
[0:34:04] <%angel949> is it because ichiban is and actual character, not a set of beliefs
[0:34:05] <%T_Sasquatch> he has his tantrums
[0:34:06] <redrins> ichiban is such a lovable idiot
[0:34:08] <IminyourBase> kiryu is not afraid to sandbag
[0:34:08] <MarvelousMrD> ichiban headbutting a guy out of a carboard box is what got me to like him more
[0:34:09] <+ArtemisCroc> ichiban reminds me of playing as majima in 0, which is why he's perfect
[0:34:09] <%Konquerer> HERESY
[0:34:10] <%Jack8274> I like emotional characters
[0:34:10] <+MordoPrime> its because kiryu its an idea, a paragon of good, ichiban its an actual character
[0:34:12] <TheNewJapanGuy> Ichiban is very likable, but I prefer Kiryu ultimately
[0:34:13] <$Captainahab_37> Ichiban seems more relatable
[0:34:15] <%sakeydo> its growing...
[0:34:17] <jorniev> DRAGON UBERMECH IS NOT AS RELATABLE AS HIMBO
[0:34:18] <%T_Sasquatch> but yea he is very jotaro and not a real person
[0:34:20] <%SmoochSpider> Ichiban is a fucking moron and I love him
[0:34:23] <%eyezehuhh> 6 kinda cemented him as meh
[0:34:23] <%TheMattman1313> Kiryu barely changes as a character and is therefore not as interesting
[0:34:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> Kiryu is a Samurai. Ichiban is a hero.
[0:34:25] <Saltmeisterr> he's like water without any ice
[0:34:29] <%Captainahab_37> I love kiryu tho
[0:34:30] <%zeif00> I'd hang out with Ichiban, but I'd wanna fuck Kiryu
[0:34:30] <extradopeness> I love Ichiban a lot actually
[0:34:31] <+SunnyVarietyPack> I like that no one is defending Yakuza 3
[0:34:33] <+DankDreamTeam> so who won subs or dubs?
[0:34:34] <%ssjklyco> KillyU
[0:34:37] <%SvenHolgersson> Kiryu is kinda too good at what he does
[0:34:37] <zenith0111> OH YEAH?!
[0:34:38] <KaironFortressKnight> Grass is greener on the other side. I want a Vergil game, like I want a Majima game, like I want a Jetstream Sam game.
[0:34:38] <+Mitchellsocks> They’re both himbos, just different types
[0:34:39] <spacecatstreams> bepis
[0:34:42] <+skyheys> Hes endearing but boring
[0:34:43] <soos1001> Kiryu fucking beats up all of Japan
[0:34:46] <%eyezehuhh> Kiryu is Jotaro and Ichiban is Josuke
[0:34:47] <%transporterthesequel> Kiryu is less of a character and more of a goddamn superhero
[0:34:48] <$Afterman_> he is a BIG HONOR BLOCK
[0:34:49] <%Cykron> Ichiban is a HERO
[0:34:49] <+aram909> @TheMattman1313 that is not true at all
[0:34:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Kiryu is more badass but more boring
[0:34:53] <jorniev> WHAT IS UP WITH YAKUZA 3
[0:34:58] <%SmoochSpider> HIMBO
[0:35:00] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Kiryu is the platonic ideal of Stoicism, Ichiban is a hot-blooded hero
[0:35:01] <@SoFarFetched> @DankDreamTeam Dubs
[0:35:02] <%Captainahab_37> so basically Yakuza sucks guys
[0:35:04] <jorniev> UNDERDOG
[0:35:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> but hes also a moron
[0:35:06] <%king_wragles> Ichiban also has a real personality
[0:35:09] <fuji_92> ICHIBAN IS A HERO
[0:35:10] <%Pookiedaexzile> Ichiban is Kambei Shimada basically
[0:35:12] <%Order_of_Mystery> Ichiban is a master shittalker, i love him
[0:35:12] <%VHGS> his one brain cell is VERY busy
[0:35:14] <$Afterman_> kiryu is only emtional when he's like "THAT'S RAD!"
[0:35:15] <%transporterthesequel> Ichi feels like a big dumb boi
[0:35:16] <ThisIsLloyd> Ultimate Himbo
[0:35:18] <cardamomo88> dumb is always better
[0:35:18] <%AnIcedCoffee> Ichiban seems like he struggles with practically everything happening around him
[0:35:19] <%TheBensonator_> He's so stupid he's fuckin' smart
[0:35:20] <+trashcansan> human dog energy. big himbo
[0:35:20] <+skyheys> @jorniev Gaiden story that's weird also clunky
[0:35:21] <+DankDreamTeam> @SoFarFetched Blest!
[0:35:24] <Broken_Sonex> Kiryu is Superman. Ichiban is Spider-Mna
[0:35:24] <+AXL808> Ichi's an actual character
[0:35:25] <@SoFarFetched> HE IS NANBA WAN
[0:35:26] <dabeaminator> It feels much more believable for Ichiban to spend 20 hours singing karaoke and racing go carts.
[0:35:30] <extradopeness> THATS RAD

[0:35:49] <%Pookiedaexzile> Can't choose ya boss
[0:35:49] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Kiryu is a legend, but that legend status carries too much weight. Ichiban is a dumbass with a heart of gold, and a brain of bronze.

[0:37:56] <%Solipsist_Construct> or you would be a Cronenbergian monstrosity
[0:37:57] <%UvBenServed> Ass is just ascended thigh

[0:37:58] <%captainpodock> WHAT ASS?

[0:37:59] <%OnlyLk> OnlyLk subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:37:59] <%hamborgini> if you were missing your ass, you could sit down, but never stand up
[0:37:59] <+tigerfang86> like HANK HILL
[0:38:00] <@BigNaturalMan59> your legs are the bottom of your butt
[0:38:01] <%Captainahab_37> what IS the purpose of buttcheeks
[0:38:01] <bomi1995> hips are more important than the ass for mobility
[0:38:01] <%Pukenasty> i think your legs are the bottom of your ass

[0:38:06] <%zeif00> Describe what you consider "the ass"
[0:38:07] <drinkmilkstrongbones> YO did you get medically diagnosed with no ass too? I had a really bad injury and the doctor nailed it down to me having no ass
[0:38:07] <%Derpinator102> Thats not how bones work
[0:38:07] <zenith0111> HUMANS ARE BASICALLY WEIRD DONUTS
[0:38:07] <+diathex> you would have no pelvis to hold your femurs
[0:38:07] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> the fuck kind of question is that
[0:38:08] <SoySocks> your legs wouldn't work right, but your legs would still be attached
[0:38:08] <%Pookiedaexzile> They would cease to work
[0:38:08] <%Not_Dutch_> asking the real questions
[0:38:08] <GoogleyGareth> No you'd have 0 muscles to move em
[0:38:09] <Fien111> It's the Pectorals of the legs. It provides the strength
[0:38:10] <%KineKithZen> Pelvis
[0:38:10] <ThDark> I mean it is a separate group of muscles
[0:38:11] <heart_ablaze> PAT NO
[0:38:11] <%T_Sasquatch> ass is a protusion
[0:38:13] <+TheMattman1313> Depeds on if you consider the top of the femur part of the legs
[0:38:14] <+MordoPrime> i have no butt and i have to sit
[0:38:14] <%strakillias> Part of the butt is the bottom of your back
[0:38:14] <+trashcansan> you have femurs so no
[0:38:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> When you were in the line to get brains, you thought they said trains and said 'No thanks, I'm lactose intolerant.'
[0:38:15] <%QueequegTheater> Ass joint
[0:38:17] <jorniev> THE SIDE OF YOUR BUTT IS THE TOP OF YOUR LEGS

[0:38:29] <Gregorhasjoined> space station 13 wizards can blow your ass off and wear as a hat, so maybe it's a thing
[0:38:30] <Goodvibes99508> so you remove the pelvis?\
[0:38:30] <@PlagueOfGripes> Pat seeks help from the least qualified person to answer, or the most
[0:38:31] <+MayorRev> It's the pelvis you ding dong
[0:38:32] <fuji_92> the ass is just the fat at the back of the leg @patstaresat

[0:43:57] <%MandMGrease> Cheer800 Interesting fact I found out: Arakawa's son from earlier in the game is voiced by the same VA as the main character of Sleeping Dogs. Can't help but feel that's ironic in some way.

[0:44:00] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt admitting to shitting himself live on stream

[0:54:48] <jorniev> its the worst
[0:54:48] <whimsicallifestyle> theyre always strong

[0:55:06] <+HelloImTom08> its not that pigeons are strong, its a shit load of them are overwhelming
[0:55:06] <zenith0111> @jorniev That's a very real thing and a dark age of the internet and society at one point....
[0:55:07] <Fien111> He runs like such a dork
[0:55:08] <Gallhint> does he have healing skills?
[0:55:09] <a_mad_dragon> they're strong against clean people
[0:55:10] <%transporterthesequel> Pigeons are fuckin LETHAL MAN
[0:55:11] <jtsoppy137> LUL he's white
[0:55:12] <Thepothero> its suuuuper rpg like
[0:55:13] <+Tadashi047> searching under the vending machines can very rarely give gold plates
[0:55:13] <%linSP> he do a nap for healing
[0:55:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> it's strong because people here are weak to blunt damage.
[0:55:17] <mrapplebucks> YAY 5$
[0:55:17] <hassanico2> Ok actual question what games have "Green Mage" in them?
[0:55:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Hood and an Umbrella
[0:55:19] <+NitronStreams> so he's a Magic Hobo?
[0:55:20] <Hideow> Tbh they have more ravens than pidges in japan
[0:55:23] <%Kataguro> He does get damage spells, but most of it is healing
[0:55:23] <CosmicApe13> the pidgeon raid is hilarious
[0:55:27] <extradopeness> Hamon Pigeon
[0:55:28] <hassanico2> Cause I know in FF Green means elemental resistances
[0:55:29] <%1matheuw> they do extra disease damage
[0:55:29] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Also this is a super big farcry from Yakuza 0 where money is FLYING from guys. Ichiban has to scrounge from cash.
[0:55:31] <cardamomo88> white hobo.. wait
[0:55:31] <%wibbwobbler> idk pigeon r pretty low tier

[1:59:25] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt Maybe the Japanese enemy barks are taunts?
[1:59:26] <Mr_Strut> Because he IS a loser

[1:59:27] <jtsoppy137> cuz he's a loser
[1:59:27] <%Not_Dutch_> cuz he's not a loser
[1:59:27] <%blue8moon> because he's not a loser
[1:59:28] <bettysharkface> The dudes are probably insulting him
[1:59:29] <%Kataguro> He needs to believe it himself
[1:59:29] <redrins> he needs to let the world know

[1:59:33] <%maybefalco> he's not a loser pat
[1:59:33] <dan_g_v> he's not a looser
[1:59:35] <MarvelousMrD> if he says it enough maybe he'll believe it

[1:59:51] <fIashman92> He also spent the entire intro of the game as a big loser

[2:05:50] <hassanico2> @velgaduere Kamurocho is Tokyo's Kabukicho
[2:05:53] <%Radski5> I was more talking about games in general rather than just Yakuza
[2:05:57] <%Kataguro> He was in the trash
[2:05:57] <@SoFarFetched> @GarbageQueenEllie cause he's been through a lot of shit since he got shot earlier and has been living as a hobo.
[2:05:58] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @GarbageQueenEllie Cuz he was thrown in the trash after getting shot
[2:06:00] <%StaceMcGate> Chrono Trigger rules
[2:06:07] <%StaceMcGate> main character gets all the tabs
[2:06:08] <dabeaminator> I think Kamurocho is based on a real city
[2:06:13] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt can you change Ichi's clothes?
[2:06:18] <Daxalog> Chrono will NEVER leave the party
[2:06:21] <$velgaduere> @hassanico2 I am aware that's what it's based on. doesn't change what I said

[2:22:13] <extradopeness> Synchroknives
[2:22:16] <Komayeda> It decreases it
[2:22:16] <Sol_Install> it's a nice take on chrono trigger
[2:22:18] <InugamiTheHound> Hell Yeah
[2:22:18] <hassanico2> @dabeaminator decreases damage by 10%

[2:22:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> perfect block stops any status effects.
[2:22:23] <%Jack8274> @dabeaminator Lowers damage a bit but prevents stun, knockdown, and status

[2:22:40] <Komayeda> I never thought Bleach would resort to this type of thing
[2:22:41] <%honeyman18> I do think the crowds turning away when they see the shit going down looks natural now.
[2:22:45] <jorniev> FUCKING BLEACH
[2:22:47] <+TheBrazilianHope> @dabeaminator it reduces the damage but different characters have different defense so it might seem like it doesn't change if he fails to block on ichi with high defense and then blocks with hobo man
[2:22:48] <%Dakuu75> w/e i'll just leave and become a boss character in 3 months

[2:56:14] <WillyFresh992> Man I wanna play this so bad, still only halfway thru Yak 4 tho
[2:56:17] <KohryuZX> Remember when Ichiban was just the Yakuza ONLINE protagonist?

[3:53:24] <+TheBrazilianHope> three men wielding bats Jebaited

[4:33:36] <+krawtch> shiny Kiryu
[4:33:37] <+MrMcCrabby> Amazing
[4:33:38] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> i too love digimon
[4:33:41] <jtsoppy137> countdown to a jojo refrence
[4:33:42] <SoySocks> no thugs and such
[4:33:44] <odiemikes> i will travel across kamourocho searching trash and bars
[4:33:48] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt I like that it retroactively recorded previous sidestory enemies
[4:33:49] <Giztech> ha it's a mash of digimon and pokemon
[4:33:49] <DashXero> Where's the Trenchcoat guy?
[4:33:49] <+tigerfang86> 252 unique enemies.....
[4:33:50] <+MonsieurHedge> or it just doesnt count until AFTER yoiu get the dex
[4:33:51] <%Kataguro> No, everything is a Sujidex
[4:33:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> go fight
[4:33:53] <%arancet> wait what??? Piss Wizard?!
[4:33:54] <%furiousfurioso> I think it just auto records the ones you couldn't possibly refight
[4:33:55] <@SSaryn> Only side quest ones got logged, the other ones you beat didn't get logged.
[4:33:57] <silver__viii> Piss Wizard got me fucked up
[4:33:57] <fuji_92> nah, maybe later
[4:33:58] <BlueLunecy> Shota's dad doesn't count but pissman does
[4:33:58] <odiemikes> these sujimon to understand the power thats inside
[4:33:59] <+gutlesscoward> maybe they autofilled in the uniques because you can't re-fight them
[4:33:59] <SoySocks> only irregular types
[4:34:00] <melonsouda> The ones that are in there now are ones you can't fight again @PatStaresAt
[4:34:00] <%maybefalco> its everything
[4:34:01] <dunkle321> Yeah it's probably only certain enemies
[4:34:03] <+FatherGreyBeard> Substory encounters are unique so they're probably auto-recorded
[4:34:04] <The_Maddness> Theyre not chewing the scenery, theyre going at the scenery with a chainsaw
[4:34:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @patstaresat It's any enemy but it doesn't count for enemies you've beaten before the app unless they're unique.
[4:34:07] <%Entroseth> Pokemon would be a very different game if you beat them down yourself in order to add their info to the pokedex
[4:34:07] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Those Trash Mimics might register if you manage to find some more
[4:34:08] <RetributionP> I think those are guys you can't fight again.
[4:34:18] <ulcaban> This is the opposite of Kill 'em all and let God sort them out
[4:34:20] <huskarl_zap> wasnt that guys like the Bleach ideal?

[4:59:28] <%Kataguro> Rude
[4:59:28] <star_feline> Ichiban is a gullible idiot that sees good in all of people
[4:59:30] <%Spydurman> I thought Ichi was gonna steal the girls for the other whore house
[4:59:31] <%StaceMcGate> Remember when George Takei shot you 8 hours ago?
[4:59:32] <JumbleJams> from himbo to moron in 10 words or less
[4:59:33] <jtsoppy137> protect his soft skull
[4:59:36] <akitanito> I don't think he can get dumber
[4:59:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Ichiban is right though lol
[4:59:39] <peanutdot007> I was kinda thinking this would be like "Ichi decides he needs to work here to reform the place" not whatever the fuck that was
[4:59:40] <%walternatorz> it's a special helmet
[4:59:41] <%king_wragles> @fuji_92 dumb, insane... take your pick!
[4:59:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> No, he's saying the store helps women by not having them resort to banging dudes in garbage cans

[4:59:56] <taquito_blade> beat all the asses
[5:00:05] <huskarl_zap> holesome criminal
[5:00:08] <taquito_blade> toasty
[5:00:08] <+starzo0> his reasoning is that an open scumbag is better than a secret one
[5:00:09] <jtsoppy137> Jeff Jerrett
[5:00:11] <wrydiculous> try and knock a goon into the traffic
[5:00:16] <+paladinstarbuster> Ichiban talks about the rough parts of society and how evne though its bad it is what is. Chat: Yikes
[5:00:16] <asurite_warrior> Way I see it Ichi probably has seen worse pimps in his whore house home. So benefit of the doubt
[5:00:16] <nmaten> tryin to make a living and doing the best i can
[5:00:17] <akitanito> push em onto traffic pat
[5:00:17] <%Cozy90> 3 random people? BETTER FIGHT EM!
[5:00:17] <+CourageTheCat> Why the fuck is he doing this, are we up to 8d chess now??
[5:00:26] <+Story_Ark> i dont think anyone has an issue with the business but how they treat people...
[5:00:26] <extradopeness> He's pimping for good! He does it in the spirit of justice and righteousness!
[5:00:27] <cardamomo88> i dont get his logic
[5:00:28] <Baeltyr> yo steal his guitar
[5:00:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> but Pat, he was BORN a ramblin' man.
[5:00:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Ichiban is totally right that Nonomiya might be an asshole, but he's still helping these girls. And he at least gives a shit about them.
[5:00:34] <odiemikes> maybe ichibans point is at least this pimp only takes desperate women who are all ready in the industry, whereas some dudes lure women into it and get them hooked on drugs? idk
[5:00:35] <+rottingpastry> I like the implication that he's skinning these people.
