[1:11:51] <%HitchhikingThrough> ooh, that table hopper though
[1:11:52] <$ggbhtg> @coreyyotto The grapple move that leaves you wide open?
[1:11:52] <cheapdoc> The bois are out
[1:11:53] <+J_PewPew> aww :<
[1:11:59] <TheEvilOmega> I felt like V was really easy.
[1:12:05] <%xcompleasedad> xcompleasedad subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 13 month streak! Well, this is certainly a challenge.
[1:12:12] <Profmcstevie> V has no errands, you don't rev or run through styles or concentrate
[1:12:14] <JaceDarkstar> @HitchhikingThrough does boss fights spawn like this as well?
[1:12:14] <%coreyyotto> @ggbhtg RE: How's Royal Guard in this mode
[1:12:16] <gryffinp> Everyone hates nobodies
[1:12:17] <%HitchhikingThrough> @PatStaresAt me too honestly
[1:12:19] <TheEvilOmega> I suck ass as Nero, though. The lack of an air dodge makes me terrible with him.
[1:12:21] <+krispen_wa> Said Sora
[1:12:21] <gustavozxd> nobodies are the actual worst enemies
[1:12:22] <Nupinoop296> wow Ansem the Wise
[1:12:22] <+TheShisno> Nobodies are the absolute worst enemy, worse than Furies
[1:12:23] <bestwaifuritsu> oops all nobodies
[1:12:24] <%nevan_44> NOBODIES WORST
[1:12:25] <$ggbhtg> Heartless aren't much better Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:12:26] <MauroUnit1> @Superspider51 I imagine the playable vergil mod is in this trainer too, since hitchhiker used Vergil to show this LDK mode on his stream yesterday, so he could play with THAT version of Vergil
[1:12:27] <%Konquerer> nobody like nobodies
[1:12:29] <+MelodyMedley> Even Roxas?
[1:12:30] <SegaDSi> I still hate how long the Angelon Buster is.
[1:12:33] <Phoenon> Air spins are the best part about Tomboy
[1:12:33] <Vaun0x> worst enemies in KH by far Kappa
[1:12:37] <%DianaTheAscian> LUL
[1:12:39] <%HitchhikingThrough> @PatStaresAt didn't feel like DMC without them
[1:12:42] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Have you tried being stylish? Keepo
[1:12:42] <%T_Sasquatch> Dante missions in this game after ceberus were pain, I revived so many times
[1:12:44] <+thequickbrownrabbit> Should of put heartless in the game instead maybe some unversed
[1:12:44] <+dr_penguin51> just juggle them andyth3Good
[1:12:45] <%chiazam> Artistic Integrity
[1:12:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @MelodyMedley ESPECIALLY Roxas
[1:12:48] <%asgard147> to make you suffer pat :)
[1:12:48] <+TheShisno> AHH GREEN EMPUSAS
[1:12:49] <gustavozxd> why do they have so much health NotLikeThis
[1:12:50] <gryffinp> hahaha oh wow the nobody got green empusa healed
[1:12:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Phoenon he's the ranged pick. Just get get used to his movement speed or be aware of your dash availability
[1:12:53] <%Superspider51> @MauroUnit1 That version of Vergil isn't worth playing anymore
[1:12:54] <troubled_ginger> oh no, not the green bugs
[1:12:55] <destinyspider> The busters on Angelos in this game ate so slow and boring. I wish they were like in DMC4. Those Angelo busters were fucking HYPR
[1:13:01] <%T_Sasquatch> playing dante is mentally damaging
[1:13:01] <ToaDeathax> hate nobodies, always going on about kingdom hearts
[1:13:01] <+snausages_> wjat about 30 nobodies
[1:13:03] <destinyspider> *HYPE goddammit
[1:13:03] <anuchallengertwitch> fun fact: even Mundus hates Nobodies. It's why he didn't give them a name
[1:13:08] <0rond> @HitchhikingThrough is this mode harder than DMD?
[1:13:22] <scrublord009> Ray trace these nuts
[1:13:23] <%HitchhikingThrough> @0rond it's easier than son of sparda actually
[1:13:32] <%HitchhikingThrough> I mean
[1:13:35] <%coreyyotto> What's a good level with lots of behemoths?
[1:13:36] <+dr_penguin51> @0rond maybe
[1:13:36] <%HitchhikingThrough> the enemy health at least
[1:13:38] <+krispen_wa> Pat's just trash
[1:13:40] <KinduVborrd> Does Pat is bad?
[1:13:43] <+Cobaltor_252> so how's the community's version of LDK?
[1:13:44] <Mr_Strut> Ragtime busters seem insanely useful in this mode
[1:13:48] <Vaun0x> yes
[1:13:50] <%Superspider51> Pat is does
[1:13:51] <%HitchhikingThrough> Pat's doing very well actually!
[1:13:53] <0rond> iunno if you added a bunch of nobodies that's a (X) doubt from me
[1:13:58] <destinyspider> @t_sasquatch He really isn't that bad. It's just a lot you can do, but that's it
[1:14:00] <+TheShisno> Unplayable
[1:14:06] <KinduVborrd> Ah, cool then
[1:14:08] <Tuna_Can_0> Do they devil trigger?
[1:14:15] <$ggbhtg> @HitchhikingThrough Level Difficulty is DH, Enemy is Sparda?
[1:14:17] <%coreyyotto> owned
[1:14:18] <+Yakobro> LUL
[1:14:19] <gryffinp> Loser!
[1:14:20] <Mr_Strut> LDK DMD mode when?
[1:14:22] <MauroUnit1> @Superspider51 yeah, having seen Beowulf gameplay on the official makes playing the modded one depressing, but hey, i still have fun with Judgement Cut End
[1:14:25] <scrublord009> KONO DIO DAAAAA
[1:14:42] <+TheShisno> ha ha Za Warudo am I right
[1:14:50] <%HitchhikingThrough> @ggbhtg level difficulty and enemy difficulty are both SOS with a 1.4 player damage modifier
[1:14:52] <%Superspider51> @MauroUnit1 if only 5SE in it's entirety was coming to PC
[1:14:54] <%spitelite> those bats are bullshit
[1:14:59] <%B_Dow> "Eat shit Capcom", love the description for the trailer Hitchhiking
[1:15:01] <%Superspider51> Calilbur would save his ass if he used it
[1:15:01] <spawnzie> @HitchhikingThrough I feel like I'm gonna be using Dante's Roman cancels a lot more with LDK
[1:15:03] <KinduVborrd> 400 Angelos
[1:15:04] <+thequickbrownrabbit> 12 Vergil's with doppelganger
[1:15:07] <$ggbhtg> sheeeit
[1:15:09] <0rond> I wonder if someone will be able to mod official beowoulf to have the look and vfx of gilgamesh
[1:15:10] <%Hasmeister96> Pat just kill the bats
[1:15:11] <%T_Sasquatch> @destinyspider maybe im trying to do too much and be cool but man my brain freezes thinking of what to do next
[1:15:15] <+Lillowh> Spite ediition?
[1:15:18] <SegaDSi> I mean V will help so it can be as bad as it getts
[1:15:28] <Bust_ER> did pat play as vergil yet
[1:15:29] <gryffinp> *Hitchiker adds three nobodies to the level*: "LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO CAPCOM"
[1:15:31] <MauroUnit1> @Superspider51 sadly, Capcom really likes dick apparently
[1:15:43] <SegaDSi> Gotta """Balance""" the fight after all
[1:15:44] <TheEvilOmega> I just beat regular DMC5 four days ago.
[1:15:46] <+krispen_wa> yeah, shuffles and caliburs would make this way easier for Pat
[1:15:52] <lukap99> pat use DT before ya die
[1:15:52] <JaceDarkstar> arm bars everywhere
[1:15:53] <+Lillowh> Oh is this the fanmade LDK?
[1:15:53] <+desfore> ...is he intentionally avoiding the bats?
[1:15:55] <lazerscraper> boss fight is gonna be a fucking riot
[1:15:57] <%DianaTheAscian> is mission 20 just always dt Vergil?
[1:15:58] <%Superspider51> Hitch left a good message for them in his video description @MauroUnit1
[1:15:59] <gryffinp> @TheEvilOmega neat, what difficulty?
[1:15:59] <+dr_penguin51> v likes to crash the game though probably just stick nero or dante lol

[1:16:42] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Its like six Cavaliere Angelo

[1:17:27] <lazerscraper> FURIES

[1:17:37] <Blackscience91> @HitchhikingThrough Will you be looking at LDK on the consoles and try to match those spawn numbers and enemy types?

[1:20:10] <wakeupsuper12> best way to deal with them is training mode

[1:20:35] <Vyneci> Also whew, hit the checkpoint
[1:20:40] <destinyspider> @t_sasquatch You just get a feel for it over time, I guess. Establish little reliable patterns to put into your gameplay, then mix in other more freeform stuff you come up with on the fly. Million Stab Guard cancels are a reliable approach tool and a few things like how to comfortably transition into a shotgun JC is all stuff you can make a lot easier through.. idk. Establishing patterns around it.
[1:20:42] <%LoneFonte> @superdeliverer PC + mods

[1:23:45] <%Invlux> What this fight needs is some Proto Angelo adds Kappa
[1:23:45] <Vyneci> This is a really cool arena to fight Vergil
[1:23:45] <%HitchhikingThrough> @PatStaresAt can you dt burst out?
[1:23:46] <+krispen_wa> SO WHAT'S MISSION 20?
[1:23:47] <%T_Sasquatch> 2 half vergils and one vergil
[1:23:47] <%thegreatbambe> thegreatbambe subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 40 months, currently on a 33 month streak! So my UWU group exploded, not because of UWU itself, but because of everyone hating the PLD that micromanaged everything after we got to enrage once. Back to the search of clearing an ultimate I go.
[1:23:47] <troubled_ginger> Let me ask this: How many Vergils are possible?

[1:25:34] <heart_ablaze> @blackjackskellington technically you can do that in bloody palace, but you need to go through a shit ton of rooms to get there
[1:25:36] <Phoenon> Vergil sure has a lot of DT gauge
[1:25:37] <%honeyman18> Like eating a streak with a rusty spoon

[1:30:50] <melonsouda> I just got here, did the stream just end or is this a break?
[1:30:51] <%HitchhikingThrough> @RodCU no dice unfortunately. Considered it, but was way too nervous
[1:30:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @drefizz when gief isn't trying to copulate with Elmo yes
[1:31:00] <+krispen_wa> @chiazam I mean yes, but the version starting with "Bury the Light Deep within" is an edited version
[1:31:07] <sadboy_otoroshi> Now what? What's he gonna play now?
[1:31:09] <%SirKeigan> What's the deal here? What Spite Edition just a joke or something? I don't get it

[1:31:25] <%SirKeigan> New artists?
[1:31:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SirKeigan spite edition is a shocase of a mod
[1:31:36] <LethalPlacebo> Anyone end up clipping that moment? I NEED to watch it again'
[1:31:37] <%Superspider51> @SirKeigan so DMC5 SE isn't coming to PC, just Vergil so modders decided to make their own SE out of spite
[1:31:39] <%arancet> @SirKeigan they wont put special on pc, so this is a mod to emulate it, hence spite
[1:31:42] <+LandOfTheWay> anyone got a clip of The Moment?
[1:31:42] <reddpop_> @sleepy_coffee he was added years after the fact
[1:31:46] <dots4eyes> Pat's spite levels have reached new highs...SSS rank even
[1:31:47] <+bassforte123> @SirKeigan Spite Edition is real, but the ending screen is a prank on Pat
[1:31:52] <sadboy_otoroshi> @SirKeigan Kiwami or Zero
[1:31:55] <%cervidaequus> Pat said after DMC was a PS5 chatting show
[1:31:57] <$ggbhtg> WHAT YOU ALL JUST SAW WAS NOT THE PS5 WHATEVER VERSION, IT WAS AN ELABORATE PC MOD SINCE CAPCOM LEFT PC USERS IN THE DUST. MOD AVAILABLE 11/16
[1:31:59] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Smokin' Sexy Spite.
[1:32:01] <gryffinp> I assume the ending screen is an existing, seperate mod

[1:38:51] <+michingmallecho> Don’t be a racist openly on mic button
[1:38:52] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> he loves Pat so much
[1:38:52] <CasualAlohaFriday> Are the Share and Option buttons as hard to 'find' and press as they are on the DS4?
[1:38:54] <+WizoSavage> @PatStaresAt so the controller is perfect for Dolphin emulation
[1:38:54] <%PaladinDupre> no cher, only bono
[1:38:55] <+ChaosAethr> @PatStaresAt So you have tried the adaptive triggers yet
[1:38:55] <xxshadowxx416> playstation just give my ps2 controller like the duke
[1:38:55] <%FalseEyeD> Same
[1:38:57] <redrins> did it blow you like it did skillup?
[1:38:57] <+EmotionalFatGuy> Pat's had the controller in his pants
[1:38:57] <jtsoppy137> same
[1:38:58] <+NitronStreams> HD rumble?
[1:38:58] <+gutlesscoward> does the controller work for pc?
[1:38:59] <Fear_Ranjer> same
[1:39:00] <salty_noodles_> Don’t share because we don’t care
[1:39:01] <+uzumakiherogame> rets rumble
[1:39:02] <gustavozxd> @PatStaresAt is the middle ps button clicky or sotf?

[1:39:05] <%twistedj3ster> better than the Switch haptics
[1:39:05] <$ggbhtg> for your ballls, yes, we know the joke chat
[1:39:05] <MaxXtreme23> same
[1:39:05] <iWBstovetop> PS4 - Pro - 2

[1:39:10] <SPidERMan8576> Demon souls time?
[1:39:10] <+NitronStreams> Same really
[1:39:13] <zashrin777> Yikes
[1:39:13] <Ipsenscastle> the rumble is why Zangief keeps putting his dick on it
[1:39:14] <Klefth> My one gripe with the new controller after using it for one week is that it gets dirty STUPID easy and it is not easy to clean because of the texture on the bottom
[1:39:14] <+michingmallecho> The rumble is good
[1:39:16] <ECRead> him good boi
[1:39:16] <RyuuAoi> Wow coward
[1:39:16] <DSD24> Destiny 2 has rumble in it
[1:39:18] <%BoxNavy> no one likes rumble
[1:39:18] <indig0bird> Honestly, same. It's really annoying most of the time
[1:39:19] <Fear_Ranjer> It's pointless feedback
[1:39:21] <+andiwaffles> you hate Digimon rumble arena? :(
[1:39:22] <gustavozxd> I love rumble in dmc3 LUL
[1:39:22] <%Monkeyweed21> is it cuz Destiny 2 suks?
[1:39:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Tech talk stop, play game now!
[1:39:24] <+michingmallecho> Rumble is LIFE
[1:39:28] <extradopeness> I hate rumble too
[1:39:28] <CasualAlohaFriday> You love it?
[1:39:31] <$ggbhtg> Haptickku Feedo Back hmm
[1:39:34] <+SilverInferno3> @PatStaresAt Better than HD Rumble?
[1:39:34] <%BoxNavy> is it cool?
[1:39:34] <bleugh> does it work on PC out of the box?
[1:39:35] <+Ancopro> 4K rumble
[1:39:35] <+HyperCharge_Sam> HD Rumble?
[1:39:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Rumble is useful.....just not for gaming
[1:39:36] <sadboy_otoroshi> He doesn't like the circulation benefits
[1:39:36] <%josstyl_0> ok
[1:39:39] <Daxalog> You mean the trigger resist?
[1:39:39] <SPidERMan8576> Rumble fish
[1:39:41] <%Maids4lyfe> !uptime
[1:39:41] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 39m.
[1:39:41] <Snookasaurus> like the switch, right? How is it different?
[1:39:42] <%LoneFonte> "its not a vibrator"
[1:39:42] <Profmcstevie> If it's eating my battery power rumbles GOING OFF
[1:39:42] <%brickwall35> it's insane
[1:39:43] <Klefth> It's basically 2 speakers @PatStaresAt
[1:39:43] <+Bail_seven> I like trigger rumble
[1:39:43] <MaxXtreme23> DMC3 rumble literally ended up hurting my wrists the other day
[1:39:46] <+TheCrispyBoi> IT'S SUPER GOOD
[1:39:46] <MateoPeso> The sand part in Astro blew my mind
[1:39:48] <Manwad> HD
[1:39:49] <$realm_forge> FUCK ZANGEIF US SO GODDAMN ADORABLE
[1:39:50] <brunoberserk> i also hate rumble because consumes more battery
[1:39:50] <%Hasmeister96> Does the dualsense controller work on PC?
[1:39:51] <%PaladinDupre> like a joycon
[1:39:52] <augusta_wind> rumble mechanics
[1:39:53] <%asgard147> hmmmm limesHmm
[1:39:54] <zashrin777> Is it more like pressure instead of a rumble feeling?
[1:39:54] <+EmotionalFatGuy> so its an autoblow with bluetooth?
[1:39:58] <%NecDW4> @PatStaresAt will it make the anime tiddys feel good in your Senran Kaguras?
[1:40:00] <extradopeness> Haptic feedback is straight up sorcery
[1:40:07] <GManx0> Does it blow you like the Travis Scott add
[1:40:08] <%YakumoYomi> Going from playing on a controller to playing on M+K is weird, precisely because I'm used to rumble/vibration
[1:40:09] <%nobleclonetrooper> Wow, Zangeif is OUT! :D <3
[1:40:09] <CasualAlohaFriday> I've come to hate rumble because it seems to shorten the long-term life of my controllers
[1:40:10] <gustavozxd> weird
[1:40:11] <RubberFistFight> it's like a very tight refined "buzz" instead of a controller-shaking motor spinning
[1:40:16] <Frostydough1> rumble from side to side
[1:40:16] <SPidERMan8576> Rez vibrator
[1:40:17] <+michingmallecho> it’s a mixture of speaker/haptics mixing together create the perfect harmony
[1:40:17] <Fear_Ranjer> wh

[1:55:17] <%T_Sasquatch> money
[1:55:17] <%scottysunday> I hope this means PC games get a bump in quality now the bar has been set higher on console
[1:55:18] <+NitronStreams> LOOK AT ALL THIS MONEY
[1:55:18] <MyNameIsRasus> I mean Bloodborne's still pretty good
[1:55:18] <%Laecerelius> Pat already did DMC5

[1:55:20] <%UvBenServed> psaBig Money
[1:55:20] <Tuna_Can_0> but I like the jank FeelsBadMan
[1:55:21] <%kewlmyc> It's now easily the best looking one

[1:55:21] <%Invlux> Yeah but does this one have a JPEG of a cat as the icon for the Cat Ring
[1:55:22] <Truinz25> Yeah, I guess if they remove the jank it might put it near the top
[1:55:23] <cipher758> Average Height Pat is going to save us all
[1:55:23] <%asgard147> limesPoggers

[1:55:25] <+WizoSavage> your character looks around
[1:55:25] <ScreamLord> What if Demon's Souls had Dark Souls 4 polish
[1:55:25] <%zedreamcast> I'm honestly sad because it feels a bit less creepy than OG DeS is
[1:55:25] <+andiwaffles> I think it's the best in some ways, like, best music, maybe best atmosphere
[1:55:28] <sylveonIRL> THANK GOD

[1:56:20] <madmomo2000> Is vaulting still a pain in the ass
[1:56:21] <%HefestoForges> partial parry time
[1:56:22] <%bread_assassin> Did they show the broken archstone on the tendency menu? I wonder if that means we'll getting DLC.
[1:56:24] <%Lion_kun> Are rings still busted?
[1:56:29] <Rixstarian> @patstaresat They increased grass weight

[1:56:44] <%BoxNavy> i dont parry in these games but i might have to start learning
[1:56:45] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt also, the animation changes from one handed to two handed
[1:56:45] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt pls do an unarmed parry
[1:56:47] <%Laecerelius> Fat ass grass!
[1:56:48] <+Grayhammatter> that little flourish
[1:56:51] <%코코꾸라> @Truinz25 No, but you can send items you can't carry to the storage automatically
[1:56:51] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Now you have to clarify what you mean when you say DS
[1:56:52] <Shishi1205> Grass quantity remains the same
[1:56:52] <%SirKeigan> Is it the same one every time or it cycles through a few?
[1:56:53] <%Monkeyweed21> IS THE CAT JPG STILL THERE
[1:56:56] <%honeyman18> This looks slick as hell so far
[1:56:57] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Pat you literally said they increased the weight on the podcast
[1:56:58] <sadboy_otoroshi> Those flourishes are so cool

[1:57:00] <HotMafia81> Dis shit rull purdy
[1:57:01] <gustavozxd> you can really feel his neck on your blade
[1:57:02] <+GunToad> bare handed backstab and reposte are the best
[1:57:05] <%T_Sasquatch> You take way less damage than i expected
[1:57:07] <%ChrisPlaysThing> This looks so different it could be a bran new game
[1:57:09] <TimesApex> So many partial parries you'd think it's Dark Souls 3
[1:57:10] <ShichiNoBushi> That's some heavy grass.
[1:57:11] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt Parry a tiny bit later than you think you need to
[1:57:11] <%BinaryFireball> any idea for your build this lp?
[1:57:12] <blackbookalpha> This is some good headset audio

[2:05:19] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Holy shit the NPCs have actual human expressions and don't telepathically project their thoughts into your mind anymore

[2:05:37] <%mike2hands> BOLDwind
[2:05:37] <+TheotherKristian> Because so much of our brain is connected with hand, these vibrations make immersion go up

[2:05:45] <+seoliart> PogChamp
[2:05:46] <%Valdorick> ... wait, thinking on it, would dying and become a ghost make your teeth white as shit?
[2:05:47] <KahnWick> The dualsense will be perfect for that new Silent Hill game, eh?
[2:05:48] <+Helmed> punch that old man
[2:05:48] <Fear_Ranjer> Oh yo that's rad
[2:05:50] <HotMafia81> That's fucking great

[2:05:52] <%Hasmeister96> "almost"?
[2:05:54] <CrimsonFox777> Is it just me, or is the game so detailed you can see his lazy eye?
[2:05:55] <jorniev> IS HE WEARING A FAKE BEARD?
[2:05:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah sounds super similar
[2:05:56] <MantresXI> Stockpile Thomas PogChamp

[2:06:00] <%Dakuu75> @barrakuta371 he jsut died to it and got teleported to nexus for first time
[2:06:03] <%Danicanada23> MOUTH FLAPS ?!
[2:06:04] <%KaiserMario> I always liked his voice
[2:06:04] <+gespenst25> what a friendly andre
[2:06:05] <RyuuAoi> Better than the Auto Blow 5000?
[2:06:05] <Jathspuh> @PatStaresAt Can you still hear the cars driving by the studio? LUL
[2:06:05] <%YakumoYomi> Actual human emoting and lip syncing in a Souls game. What is this Bluepoint devilry?!
[2:06:07] <nutimik> I really don't like this new UI
[2:06:10] <ThDark> They did? That's great, recasting the old cast is always a cool thing
[2:06:11] <JayPastaForce> feels weird to see a good looking souls
[2:06:12] <+andiwaffles> pretty good deal cant lie
[2:06:13] <%thbluewarden> its weird seeing their mouths move, but in a good way
[2:06:15] <%SirKeigan> Same people just re-recorded for quality of audio
[2:06:16] <DSD24> I hope Thomas is cool
[2:06:16] <%Lion_kun> ITS THE SAME GUY
[2:06:18] <%barrakuta371> Sick

[2:06:26] <dabeaminator> That lip sync is a little flappy
[2:06:26] <jorniev> WHAT IS WITH HIS MOUTH
[2:06:28] <+ChaosAethr> HOW MUCH WAS THE ED STONE?
[2:06:30] <Drusain> I liked the gruffness from the original voice
[2:06:30] <%SirKeigan> Like Brok and the other guy
[2:06:32] <tolloponik> Ah stockpile Thomas lost his ponytail D:
[2:06:33] <%Bailey__gaming> that voice is v familiar
[2:06:35] <tanarath> 'It's just a graphical skin over the original' except for the cutdcenes, redone dialog, better combat...
[2:06:35] <Parapattern> Aww, he's not as gross
[2:06:38] <+andiwaffles> 'there's a cooler, better blacksmith'
[2:06:41] <GoogleyGareth> Facial animations are odd.
[2:06:41] <+tigerfang86> the FISTFIGHTING OLD MEN
[2:06:45] <SpookyCookieMonster> remember no music Kappa
[2:06:46] <%Dakuu75> CHAT, the MOUTHS ARE MOVING~!!! it's FREAKING ME OUT
[2:06:46] <Ipsenscastle> I think my dualsense is possessed by an evil spirit, the rumble keeps hurting me and making me bleed everywhere
[2:06:47] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> i love that they got the originals
[2:06:52] <%Monkeyweed21> thats wrong Pat

[2:08:02] <+ScratchMythic> wonder if the replication glitch works
[2:08:02] <+andiwaffles> at least Thomas will never lose purpose because you'll always have five million literal rocks

[2:09:49] <%BoxNavy> use the pee filter
[2:09:49] <DSD24> Green it up
[2:09:50] <augusta_wind> green
[2:09:50] <dabeaminator> Ah, the Fallout 3 filter
[2:09:53] <ScreamLord> Mountain Dew Filter
[2:09:54] <%trustycoyote> Whoa... filters. That's crazy
[2:09:55] <Louie_Salmon> I bet some areas look super good on certain filters
[2:09:56] <%Laecerelius> Piss filter!
[2:09:57] <%DianaTheAscian> does this have a photo mode???
[2:09:57] <%SirKeigan> Camera
[2:09:58] <BinaryShuffle> Mountain Dew filter
[2:10:04] <%Broken_Sonex> Woolie would pick green
[2:10:05] <jorniev> WALRUSES
[2:10:05] <%SirKeigan> What was original?
[2:10:06] <+hoenhime344> got filters for days dawg
[2:10:08] <killaholic89> it has a photo mode
[2:10:09] <%linSP> hell ya who else got a ps5 from walmart just now
[2:10:10] <jorniev> ORIFICES
[2:10:11] <promessav2> pat barely looked at the creator
[2:10:13] <Jathspuh> Aris filter
[2:10:13] <hassanico2> @DianaTheAscian it doubles as a pause button
[2:10:14] <%AoiRob> PISS
[2:10:15] <+Javaa01> Camera Offset
[2:10:18] <RyuuAoi> PS5 4 SHROOMS
[2:10:19] <extradopeness> Bluepoint loves doing that filter business
[2:10:20] <%SirKeigan> It's supposed to change so you're character is in the imddle of the screen right?
[2:10:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> I get why people like this, but it doesn't look that great to me. At least it's not Godfall.
[2:10:27] <StarlitStunner> Drinkin a 40 in a death basket
[2:10:29] <+tigerfang86> ANGRIEST PAT
[2:10:31] <%Cervarian> It chnages how the camera follows your character as well
[2:10:31] <+ArtsyFoxo> PogChamp
[2:10:31] <%BoxNavy> D:

[2:10:42] <jorniev> MORPHEOUS ORPHEOUS
[2:10:43] <%TheWinged7> honestly, the only thing that irks me is the UI redesign looking at it
[2:10:44] <+Despera__> LOOK AT HER FEET
[2:10:47] <BliVru> Is the last Stone still broken?
[2:10:49] <dabeaminator> The character being off-center is pissing me off
[2:10:50] <Gallhint> is a filter still on?
[2:10:52] <%TheWinged7> it just doesnt feel souls somehow
[2:10:54] <+ArtsyFoxo> Just popped in. This is definitely looking pretty groovy
[2:10:55] <%averyoddjew> photo mode actually pauses the game
[2:10:55] <%arkv01> ZOOM FEET
[2:10:56] <%arkv01> ENHANCE
[2:10:59] <Parapattern> I still can't believe that Demon's Souls of all games got this kind of treatment
[2:10:59] <+MordoPrime> do photo mode, you can totally do a god of war here

[2:14:33] <%Broken_Sonex> NEVER be PURE white
[2:14:34] <%BoxNavy> when are we gonna learn about world tendency
[2:14:35] <%Jekado> @Saltmeisterr yeah if you are dead you have lower health

[2:14:36] <%T_Sasquatch> it doesnt seem like you canp parry jump attacks
[2:14:37] <+PodreySanchezz> trying to be hype but failed
[2:14:38] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt Did they do anything to fix the grass situation?

[2:14:50] <%RadDude6969> good thing the cling ring is nearby
[2:14:52] <Saltmeisterr> ok
[2:14:53] <AdmiralNakwoo> the UI is just too neat
[2:14:58] <%SirKeigan> He's glowy because he's in soul form
[2:14:58] <%linSP> hes soul form
[2:14:59] <Highwang> a realization: the era of the Scraping Spear fucker at these stairs returns
[2:15:00] <%Jekado> time for some battle tendency
[2:15:01] <+zsDirtyHarry> Where's the cat jpeg!
[2:15:01] <rasamune> That's a lot of bloodstains on the first set of stairs!
[2:15:02] <BliVru> @hassanico2 It weights more now
[2:15:04] <Vyskus> good old world tendency
[2:15:07] <%trustycoyote> @hassanico2 Yes. Stack is capped to 5
[2:15:08] <DSD24> @very_ap3 He is in spirt form right now and has half health
[2:15:08] <Admiral_PopnFresh> so world tendency is back...ok
[2:15:09] <+RedKazoo> I wanna see the Penetrator
[2:15:10] <+CannonHeroBrett> SOUL FORM
[2:15:11] <lethallylactic> PogChamp
[2:15:12] <%BoxNavy> do you just ignore world tendency and not give a shit about it? what does it even do?
[2:15:13] <Vyskus> glad the bullshit is still in here lol
[2:15:15] <+hoenhime344> that sound designe
[2:15:16] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> tomatoPog
[2:15:16] <hassanico2> @BliVru ...how is that a fix
[2:15:17] <chronoxgp> that is some star trek level shit
[2:15:18] <%heartlesshealer> hopefully there'll be a font size patch later?
[2:15:19] <NikolasKage> The amount of bloodstains is hilarious
[2:15:19] <star_feline> NICE
[2:15:19] <%DianaTheAscian> very nice
[2:15:20] <very_ap3> oh okay ty guys

[2:15:26] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> holy shit pat
[2:15:29] <JayPastaForce> can't wait for CRAZY TALK
[2:15:29] <%Invlux> Kappa
[2:15:30] <%AncelDeLambert> HAVE CONFIDENCE
[2:15:30] <Sigma_190_Beta> What are the stabs for the staff?
[2:15:30] <extradopeness> Battle tendency aka just run away
[2:15:31] <+Medvp> very nice
[2:15:31] <%s1rcuit> @hoenhime344 right?
[2:15:32] <alphonseisbest> OMFG THE SFX DUDE!!!!!
[2:15:32] <SaltyAzteca> You mean Dark Souls Kappa
[2:15:34] <$luckypineapple> crazy talk activate!
[2:15:35] <Zezinizzle> Its running on the same code right? rad
[2:15:35] <%SirKeigan> It's the same as Dark Souls dude
[2:15:36] <jerkhov_> That sound effect sounds gross
[2:15:36] <TylerRich117> spells look great!! just waiting for the inevitable patch that breaks them LUL
[2:15:37] <hassanico2> Demon's Souls IS fairly easy if you've beaten all of FromSoft's other games
[2:15:37] <Explodincatz> pew pew
[2:15:38] <FuzzTime> ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
[2:15:39] <cliffpuncher> It's okay. Nobody understands World Tendency. If they say otherwise they're filthy liars.
[2:15:39] <%JetpackMcQuack> So this won't be completely miserable
[2:15:40] <%heartlesshealer> yeah magic looks cooler now
[2:15:41] <%josstyl_0> PREPARE FOR IMMINENT STUMBP
[2:15:42] <rcand9> you can parry jumping attacks whoever said you cant just got proven wrong
[2:15:43] <Arisato_II> jesus christ, Magic hurts like shit, those guys hate it
[2:15:44] <%TheWinged7> psaCrazy psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:15:44] <%SirKeigan> You played DS3 recently so you have it fresh in your mind
[2:15:46] <rasamune> - Counter -
[2:15:46] <dabeaminator> Demons Souls had a mana bar instead of attunement slots? Why did it take until DS3 to bring that back?
[2:15:47] <hassanico2> Like, just from sheer experience
[2:15:48] <+CannonHeroBrett> shouldnt have said that
[2:15:48] <akitanito> Crazy talk incoming?
[2:15:48] <+skylerpilot> @Davimotion96 sertain enemies, areas and npc's show up depending on your world tendency. World tendency is affected by the actions of all players online or if offline only yours
[2:15:49] <Drusain> what's in the hole
[2:15:50] <%Dakuu75> But... can I play Demon Souls, the way I play Bloodborne?
[2:15:51] <BliVru> @hassanico2 They barely touched gameplay here, just graphics
[2:15:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> Confidence is a slow and insidous killer
[2:15:52] <+CannonHeroBrett> now your gona eat shit
[2:15:52] <augusta_wind> stumbo time
[2:15:55] <+bassforte123> @BoxNavy Some items and such are behind doors that only open with the right tendancy. Though there's a trick to force a kind of tendancy if you nkow what you're doing
[2:15:59] <+Cinnerennic> is this Dante or Virgil?
[2:16:01] <%SirKeigan> SOUL HOLE
[2:16:01] <TheMadBadger> @Vyskus I'm not. Souls vets won't stick around long enough and the noobs will get annoyed by invaders with the scraping spear/baby's nail.
[2:16:02] <%s1rcuit> this game looks like it'd feel good to play, if that makes any sense
[2:16:02] <extradopeness> would you say you... Have Confidence?
[2:16:03] <%G_Thunders> Turns out the biggest problem with spells in Souls game was the sound design
[2:16:05] <%Solid_Stro> Tempting your Stand’s power I see psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:16:06] <sonicblade38> sticky white stuff where
[2:16:08] <b_ikki> we'll never know
[2:16:09] <+meowarco> LUL
[2:16:10] <%PaladinDupre> cut to pat playing og demons souls last night in prep
[2:16:13] <+Grayhammatter> he went in swinging LUL
[2:16:13] <olwe123> I wonder what crazy build Spy is going to run
[2:16:15] <Zezinizzle> Its the same code as the original game
[2:16:18] <%WhereIsWill> the NOOB pit
[2:16:21] <%moogleboy1984> How's the aim without lockon?
[2:16:27] <Arisato_II> the screams
[2:16:27] <killaholic89> i jumped down the pit expecting a secret
[2:16:33] <Arisato_II> jesus
[2:16:37] <Gallhint> drop your shield!
[2:16:37] <rcand9> demons always was backstab the game
[2:16:37] <dabeaminator> Is Plague already finding reasons to hate this game?

[2:17:46] <hassanico2> @DSD24 Sticky White Stuff :)
[2:17:47] <oAznoUta> what's with all these Diablo 2 paladin auras the character's got on?
[2:17:47] <jaggstar2020> A new generation of people hazed by friendly advice

[2:17:57] <extradopeness> I love their weird board helmets
[2:18:02] <Saltmeisterr> does DeS have a depraved class?

[2:18:07] <+hoenhime344> no framereate drop
[2:18:08] <rcand9> excellent
[2:18:13] <+sermittens> @PatStaresAt what is the best boss fight in the game?
[2:18:14] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah its werid
[2:18:15] <%trustycoyote> I feel that
[2:18:18] <+zsDirtyHarry> Has anybody counted how many triangles make up this game yet?
[2:18:19] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt why is your character glowing?
[2:18:19] <rcand9> thats how i feel too
[2:18:21] <%KaiserMario> It'd comfy
[2:18:21] <+SuperCreeperBlocks> I can’t wait for the prison
[2:18:23] <Profmcstevie> The opposite of how we felt playing DMC5 today
[2:18:23] <%SirKeigan> It's a slower pace
[2:18:24] <jtsoppy137> broken

[2:18:27] <%Monkeyweed21> your nostalgia pants are nice and full
[2:18:28] <%averyoddjew> i totally get that
[2:18:29] <$valkuma> thsi was my favorite game of the series
[2:18:32] <hassanico2> @sermittens Maiden Astraea Kappa
[2:18:33] <rasamune> It gets very zen at a point
[2:18:34] <Nobuwaroo> does the repost go through the jaw?
[2:18:34] <+andiwaffles> it feels rhythmic when it clicks yeah
[2:18:35] <+BigGooj> it's being content, is a good feeling
[2:18:36] <+NitronStreams> Demon's Souls and Chill
[2:18:37] <BinaryShuffle> nostalgia + familiarity
[2:18:37] <Admiral_PopnFresh> home
[2:18:39] <+Despera__> Once you get good at a souls game just running through a level is the most zen shit
[2:18:39] <DSD24> @Dakuu75 He's in soul form he has health health right now
[2:18:39] <thelonechris> Not as fast as Bloodborne
[2:18:41] <+jjacksterup> its the feeling of knowing that you've gotten good @PatStaresAt
[2:18:46] <%SirKeigan> I play Souls games as a thing to do while listening to the weekly podcast
[2:18:46] <MyNameIsRasus> i wish a ps5 didn't cost 5 times my monthly salary
[2:18:50] <hassanico2> Although to be honest they really kinda messed up Astrea's theme
[2:18:53] <+ChaosAethr> So does anyone know if the scrapping Spear works the same?
[2:18:53] <RyuuAoi> It just very familiar 4 u
[2:18:54] <corepercentlives> can see making them demon's souls 2 now
[2:18:55] <extradopeness> That’s all DeS and DaS 1 are... chill easy going games it’s wild how they got so amped up
[2:19:00] <%averyoddjew> vaati was gushing about the vibrations as the enemies threw firebombs
[2:19:00] <destinyspider> Fire effects in this game look very weird
[2:19:03] <Klefth> Nah, I get what you mean. Souls games are just... oddly comfy
[2:19:03] <%JetpackMcQuack> Compare this to Sekiro
[2:19:06] <+andiwaffles> @hassanico2 I agree
[2:19:06] <$valkuma> going from this game to dark souls 1 was what made me quit dark souls 1. DES is so much better.
[2:19:08] <%Lion_kun> Still no drop attacks
[2:19:08] <%AoiRob> how far in is the poison swamp shithole in this one
[2:19:09] <hassanico2> It's not THAT hard
[2:19:11] <sadboy_otoroshi> Everything is down to muscle memory, I also tend to relax when I play DS2
[2:19:12] <Zezinizzle> so many copies in bargan bins and stuff
[2:19:16] <Arisato_II> what rings u got tho
[2:19:18] <hassanico2> Agreed
[2:19:21] <extradopeness> Slowwww paced
[2:19:22] <star_feline> it's really not hard
[2:19:25] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt Like half the bosses are puzzle bosses too!
[2:19:29] <%JetpackMcQuack> Still a good time
[2:19:32] <Zombrocom> That sure is a demon's souls alright
[2:19:32] <StarsCrusader> There's an option to disable auto-equip items dude!
[2:19:34] <cliffpuncher> You think they'll give Dark Souls this kind of treatment?
[2:19:34] <extradopeness> VERY SLOW almost GLACIAL pace
[2:19:34] <Ethel9727> Pat is activatiing Crazy Talk SO HARD
[2:19:35] <%RadDude6969> I platinumed Bloodborne recently so when I get hands on this it should be a cakewalk
[2:19:36] <+Jaegen16> Pat you can turn off auto equip items in the settings
[2:19:36] <%Monkeyweed21> @valkuma you're wrong but ok
[2:19:39] <ishouldbeatworklol> @patstaresat ive watched so many of ur streams on youtube finally i got you in the flesh!
[2:19:43] <Gallhint> hubris
[2:19:43] <$Hommando> Words that will be eaten
[2:19:43] <DSD24> Black Flame Black Flame
[2:19:43] <valriot> Most Souls game are really easy besides the DLC. Sekiro is hard but also terrible
[2:19:44] <Clowns> does this play differently to the original?
[2:19:45] <Calamity2007> It's piss easy compared to the latter FromSoft games
[2:19:45] <+Mitchellsocks> Did he die to Vanguard?
[2:19:46] <rcand9> wont stop articles saying its too hard
[2:19:47] <%T_Sasquatch> you know whats hard ? fucking nioh
[2:19:50] <%spitelite> go to 3-1 next then
[2:19:50] <%WhereIsWill> firelurker messed me up
[2:19:54] <rcand9> yup
[2:19:54] <dabeaminator> I need to know if unarmed builds are viable
[2:19:55] <+SuperCreeperBlocks> It’s still my favourite souls game
[2:19:55] <Clowns> seems a bit different by eye 🤔
[2:19:56] <$valkuma> Monkeyweed21 found the guy who played dark1 as his first souls
[2:19:56] <Zezinizzle> Yup
[2:20:00] <MyNameIsRasus> valley is just easier blighttown
[2:20:01] <+SunnySideX> beat so many bosses first try, only died to False King and the blind monk
[2:20:01] <chronoxgp> valley of the muppets
[2:20:02] <californaya> unless they balanced it
[2:20:02] <Explodincatz> so its an easy game with poor teaching methods
[2:20:02] <rasamune> And actual draw distance
[2:20:03] <corepercentlives> for veterans remake is like a nostalgia tour
[2:20:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> were people juat not used to the difficulty when it came out?
[2:20:06] <CozyCoat> valley of defilement nerfed
[2:20:07] <RubberFistFight> This is a spectacular remake as well, since it takes care of some of the big impediments the OG had - the jank, the kind of unrefined feel, and the FRAMERATE ISSUES @PatStaresAt
[2:20:07] <+andiwaffles> I played Bloodborne first and then DeS followed by DS1 and I still thought DeS was hard
[2:20:07] <Arisato_II> was the valley hard?
[2:20:08] <+SmoresandOreos> Maneater is a JERK
[2:20:13] <%ssjklyco> They should force the framerate to be shitty just on that part
[2:20:17] <+Javaa01> I mean, those wacky waving plague guys will still get you, regardless of framerate, not even Second Chance can save you from those
[2:20:19] <hassanico2> God I may dislike some visual changes but the SFX is top tier
[2:20:19] <artoflec> i think 4 - 2 was the hardest
[2:20:22] <%JetpackMcQuack> The real win is not needing a PS3
[2:20:22] <%kyh9> What are the major structural differences between this and Dark Souls?
[2:20:24] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt whats up the enemies weird hats
[2:20:26] <%Hasmeister96> Is this running at 60fps or 30?
[2:20:29] <+Helmed> "we didnt want to step on miyuzakis vision and reduced framerate to 5fps in valley only"
[2:20:30] <chronoxgp> valley was hard you get poisened no matter what
[2:20:30] <Zezinizzle> cant wait for storm king bruh
[2:20:32] <rcand9> valley at 60 PogChamp lets go
[2:20:33] <+Donchalant402> how is it so far?
[2:20:35] <Vermillion129> 60
[2:20:35] <extradopeness> It’s not difficult in the slightest if you don’t rush yourself
[2:20:37] <Sapphire_Breeze> @Arisato_II a combination of poison, 10fps and not being able to see helped
[2:20:38] <hassanico2> @artoflec 4-2 is the one with jellyfish?
[2:20:39] <%AnIcedCoffee> They patched the dupe glitch and the armor spider skip so I'm sad
[2:20:41] <abuse_of_zeus> @Hasmeister96 60
[2:20:42] <Arisato_II> make them S C R E A M
[2:20:44] <%chiazam> Why is Pat glowing?
[2:20:46] <DSD24> Soul effects look good too
[2:20:46] <+RedKazoo> weird hats are cool bro
[2:20:47] <alwayspronking> its how you tell they are enemies
[2:20:49] <RubberFistFight> @hassanico2 what visual changes don't you like?
[2:20:49] <HotMafia81> Weird hats for weird cats
[2:20:49] <+Donchalant402> pat is using magic? the fuck
[2:20:51] <+sermittens> @PatStaresAt where can I praise the sun in this game?
[2:20:52] <+deviljhojho_> those are some stupid looking hats
[2:20:53] <%RobotPancake> I feel like confidence is the stat that matters most off screen. played scared and got stomped back in the day
[2:20:54] <jtsoppy137> its silly hat day
[2:20:55] <%Hasmeister96> @abuse_of_zeus thanks
[2:20:57] <%Northward12> does the mail breaker have different animations?
[2:21:01] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> They look like Patrick Star when he nailed that wooden board to his head
[2:21:04] <%NecDW4> @PatStaresAt Hows the haptic feel when you do the magic? IS there anything for it?
[2:21:04] <hassanico2> @RubberFistFight some bosses, fat guys
[2:21:05] <Klefth> I NEED to know if the fat guys still have their old silly laugh
[2:21:06] <artoflec> @hassanico2 its shrine of storms with all the ghosts and grim reapers and SLUGS and precarious pathways with big skellies
[2:21:06] <+andiwaffles> @kyh9 the differences are more like its similarities with Bloodborne, hub world, level-up lady, warping from zones, no estus
[2:21:08] <Sapphire_Breeze> praise the fog
[2:21:08] <alwayspronking> predates praise
[2:21:10] <rcand9> no silly sun bros
[2:21:10] <Zezinizzle> no sun praising
[2:21:10] <CrimsonFox777> No Sun Praising? 0/10

[2:21:16] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> 0/10 game sucks
[2:21:17] <+Ultimate_Edge> No praise the sun. You must praise UMBASA

[2:21:31] <+trashcansan> 0/10
[2:21:33] <Gallhint> its going to be nice to experience a souls game without all the stupid lore pandering
[2:21:33] <+Voldra> Make "praise the sun" DLC and just watch the cash roll in.
[2:21:34] <%barrakuta371> The Real Demon's Souls starts here

[2:21:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt we could say its your sword

[2:23:39] <Gallhint> people have such a hard time understanding remake and remaster
[2:23:44] <Arisato_II> the black knight moveset
[2:23:47] <DSD24> Man the Blue Knight are gutteral
[2:23:48] <Bonbie> But can you roll omni-directionally though
[2:23:50] <MyNameIsRasus> on one side, i really don't like exclusivity. on the other, infinite sony money means games this shiny and with no lootboxes

[2:23:58] <+andiwaffles> @PatStaresAt do you think DeS is better than DS2 and/or DS3?
[2:23:58] <%cvp5127> how big is the parry window?
[2:23:58] <rcand9> now fight red eye
[2:24:00] <%arcielardor> how's the timing? Any different from the original?
[2:24:00] <Daxalog> Is it possible to make the HUD bigger if you wanted to?
[2:24:06] <sylveonIRL> maybe if you were stronger you could break hsi guard :)
[2:24:07] <Vermillion129> @Northward12 no
[2:24:08] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt but can you speeen tho?
[2:24:09] <%RadDude6969> blue knight is easy to parrry
[2:24:10] <%T_Sasquatch> seriously i kinda hate estus after bloodborne
[2:24:11] <%maenos2> those are some crisp sounds
[2:24:14] <%KaiserMario> Drop down the middle?
[2:24:14] <%heartlesshealer> psaSmug
[2:24:17] <+jjacksterup> do you see the raytracing on the blood stains
[2:24:18] <+jjacksterup> nut
[2:24:19] <artoflec> @Louie_Salmon i dont like a lot of the sound design, the quality of the sound is great, but the actual sounds they wound up with vary. Adjudicator's stupid bird has an actual painful screech it does now.
[2:24:21] <extradopeness> it’s crazy that I’m getting the Sam exact feeling seeing this as I did back in the day watching the PS3 version
[2:24:21] <cheapdoc> How is it? Is it as good as it looked?
[2:24:27] <Saltmeisterr> good SPEEENN
[2:24:29] <%NecDW4> @PatStaresAt Cant wait to see how everyone who have only played the DkS games have to deal with no mid-level bonfires

[2:24:32] <extradopeness> Wait who’s Sam
[2:24:33] <%Northward12> dang thats brutal gotta choose your weapon early
[2:24:34] <+Drspiderskull92> it's the Demon Souls we made along the way
[2:24:34] <badddladdd> Is this shaping up to be a good remake or is this full poopoo diaper mode

[2:24:52] <%averyoddjew> a ghost of pat's future just walked by
[2:24:54] <%AnIrishPapaya> I'm late to the "DMC" playthrough. Someone explain whats happening and how
[2:24:55] <rasamune> @BoxNavy for bloodborne it's either "let us cleanse these foul streets" or "the sky and the cosmos are one". or just a motherfucker doing the Make Contact pose
[2:24:56] <indig0bird> Maybe the framerate were the friends we made along the way
[2:25:04] <cuckholdberry_finn> MISSED ONE
[2:25:04] <Golden_Battler> I can't BELIEVE that guy falls the exact same way
[2:25:04] <Arisato_II> they really REALLY kept the old AI
[2:25:04] <%BoxNavy> that was a slick animation
[2:25:05] <Parapattern> Two Chains Pat
[2:25:05] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> 2 chains pat
[2:25:06] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt 2 chains Pat

[2:25:08] <+jjacksterup> @PleasantLeech F
[2:25:09] <%T_Sasquatch> i would NEVER have hit that chain , wtf
[2:25:11] <rcand9> adjudicator looks great what are you guys on about
[2:25:12] <+smevvster> From a technical standpoint, the remake is quite impressive. The old art direction was fuckin murdered, though.
[2:25:13] <FuzzTime> ISTG 90% of Demon's Soul difficulty came from the abysmall framerate @PatStaresAt
[2:25:13] <%spitelite> you missed a chain
[2:25:14] <%JaydenSai> @PatStaresAt You missed a chain
[2:25:14] <%RadDude6969> blood vials are managable, but still worse than estus
[2:25:14] <%enickma11> 2 chains boyo
[2:25:14] <jorniev> TWO CHANS
[2:25:17] <%Psych_man13_13> Boo, rip dead frame rate

[2:25:22] <Meltgar> 2 chains LUL
[2:25:22] <AFlyingTaco1> So when do the invasions start?
[2:25:23] <buerdo> 2chains
[2:25:25] <MyNameIsRasus> the only exposure i've ever had of DeS was the streams on the old channel so this is real cool
[2:25:27] <%SirKeigan> A jolly stroll
[2:25:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> @anirishpapaya the dmc5 mod memed on pat so hes playing demon souls now
[2:25:30] <%G_Thunders> I’d love a remake that puts in an artificial bad FPS mode
[2:25:30] <Fac_crono> miss one chain
[2:25:30] <extradopeness> THEY ASK ME WHAT I DO AND WHO I DO IT FOR
[2:25:31] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt It's shocking how many things From borrowed from this game
[2:25:32] <%SirKeigan> 2chains
[2:25:38] <%KilljoyHexx> Holy shit this looks great
[2:25:39] <Meltgar> @AFlyingTaco1 I think you gotta be "human"?
[2:25:42] <lucas18293> hey pat, I just wanted to say, I really enjoy your anecdotes. They set the stream apart.
[2:25:43] <+andiwaffles> im really happy that the old AI remains bc all I wanted was the ability to talk to new players and have our experience be essentially the same

[2:26:07] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt Remember when Shuhei Yosihda tried to kill this game? LUL
[2:26:08] <%Jekado> but armored core though!
[2:26:08] <Pylohn> the audio is insane the magic sounds amaze ballz
[2:26:09] <%BoxNavy> i cannot get over how good that chain looks when its falling
[2:26:09] <dabeaminator> BUT THE AESTHETIC MYEH
[2:26:11] <FuzzTime> If it ain't broke just keep trying to remake it
[2:26:11] <%FalseEyeD> This was the longest project ever for Blue Point
[2:26:14] <+sermittens> @PatStaresAt do you think Eldan Ring will come out at all or 2025?
[2:26:14] <%arcielardor> This looks hella pretty and refined.
[2:26:16] <rcand9> demons was the og and it deserves to be given a new coat of paint
[2:26:18] <neekocheeko> not a lot of souls fans played demons, and this sure looks nice

[2:27:01] <%SirKeigan> They kept the gender spescific shit
[2:27:03] <+smevvster> The new Tower Knight soundtrack is a fucking joke compared to the original.
[2:27:03] <Tempacco> women only

[2:27:31] <+Grayhammatter> lame
[2:27:31] <chronoxgp> nah that's how it works
[2:27:31] <JayPastaForce> only brave warriors dress in drags for stats

[2:27:38] <AFlyingTaco1> The female lute knight set also looks way shittier than the male's.

[2:27:39] <+DeltascapeV4> @PatStaresAt are world tendencies removed from the remake?
[2:27:39] <+play_un_squadron> fashion souls or death dammit
[2:27:40] <$Skelemungus> man no crossdressing

[2:28:02] <%KaiserMario> Play VVymin tho
[2:28:03] <%FalseEyeD> HELL NO
[2:28:04] <rasamune> @hassanico2 probably just an attempt not to be gender-police-y, even though the game is still doing it mechanically
[2:28:05] <%SirKeigan> Just easier to understand
[2:28:07] <Daxalog> The fuck is a Tendency
[2:28:08] <ahaegotrigger> no boys allowed LUL
[2:28:10] <Arisato_II> no giants archatone
[2:28:10] <star_feline> why even have the option to have female clothing on male playthroughs?

[2:28:11] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt When do we get JPEG CAT
[2:28:12] <Arisato_II> f
[2:28:12] <+andiwaffles> I am a woman and I chose a guy and I was so pissed when I couldn't wear the executioner set lmao
[2:28:15] <extradopeness> Wow it’s just all there
[2:28:15] <%Ner234> The fact that they kept the broken one is weird LUL
[2:28:15] <$TheYharnamTheorem> The TRUE Demons are these goddamn Liberals.
[2:28:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> You juse need to reroll withb some of them lady taters
[2:28:16] <akitanito> Barely any fall damage
[2:28:17] <dabeaminator> Why put the broken stone in the middle? Kinda throws off the flow of the menu.
[2:28:18] <cheapdoc> And you didn't die from a 5 foot drop
[2:28:19] <MSN04_Sazabi> In DS2 that would've killed you LUL
[2:28:19] <ralphfromdk> Look at that lack of fall damage :o
[2:28:22] <+FatherGreyBeard> Oh wow I expected Death
[2:28:23] <+Over_ninek> this could be an ASMR stream
[2:28:23] <+LandOfTheWay> lol that fall would have fucking killed you in ds2
[2:28:26] <hassanico2> @rasamune They also took out the Gender slider so it's doubly weird
[2:28:26] <%RadDude6969> psaBlep
[2:28:26] <+CatastropheCorvid> What about the Cat Ring?
[2:28:29] <Orenjevel> !uptime
[2:28:29] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 28m.

[2:28:38] <%enickma11> psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep
[2:28:39] <Drusain> Thief ring is 1-1
[2:28:40] <rcand9> the icons used to be so hard to work out "my world tendency is pink???"
[2:28:41] <%SirKeigan> 3-1?
[2:28:42] <%DianaTheAscian> is jpeg cat still in?
[2:28:43] <%FalseEyeD> Just a normal icon now
[2:28:44] <redrins> wasnt it the baby nail chick
[2:28:44] <Sigma_190_Beta> Give us JPEG Cat
[2:28:45] <CrimsonFox777> I appreciate how floppy that rope was when you walked through it.
[2:28:47] <+D00msDayDan> is the cat's ring buff still just a photo of a cat?
[2:28:50] <cuckholdberry_finn> Thief ring is right here
[2:28:52] <valriot> I just started playing DS2 again and watching that drop gave me anxiety. Half that distance would be a death.
[2:28:54] <%WhereIsWill> psaBlep
[2:28:54] <%KaiserMario> Thief ring isn't cat, but it's here on 1-1
[2:28:56] <%코코꾸라> @averyoddjew Still there, but you can send items to storage automatically
[2:28:59] <%linSP> psaJpeg
[2:28:59] <fuji_92> RIP jpeg rat
[2:28:59] <Sapphire_Breeze> @Daxalog world state that can change items and some enemies. you get "white" for killing bosses and "black" for killing people and dying too much
[2:29:00] <akitanito> it's PNG cat this time
[2:29:00] <%SirKeigan> It's 5-2

[2:29:18] <Daxalog> oh okay
[2:29:19] <Sigma_190_Beta> Do it
[2:29:20] <%bone_reaper69> @PatStaresAt did I hear that you can pause now?
[2:29:21] <hassanico2> @FatherGreyBeard You heard him. Literaly Mind Flayer.
[2:29:22] <Copious_Koopies> but the ring
[2:29:23] <Sigma_190_Beta> It'll be funny
[2:29:25] <Saltmeisterr> HAAARRRKK
[2:29:25] <+REDtheBEAST> Knowing how Bluepoint works jpeg cat is dead.
[2:29:26] <Drusain> that's where the thief ring is though
[2:29:27] <Klefth> But FAHTHAH!
[2:29:29] <%RadDude6969> @valriot I feel that
[2:29:30] <Sigma_190_Beta> Theif ring is there.
[2:29:31] <%averyoddjew> @코코꾸라 oh thank god
[2:29:33] <%arkv01> props to bluepoint for once again killing it on remakes
[2:29:43] <Vermillion129> theif ring is 1-1, patches and 5-2
[2:29:45] <%Psych_man13_13> But ring pat
[2:29:47] <+SuperCreeperBlocks> It’ll be funny bro do it pentawBeef
[2:29:47] <%SirKeigan> BluePoint is the go-to for remakes now
[2:29:48] <+smevvster> Bluepoint doesn't know anything about "Charm", they only know "production value"
[2:29:49] <cuckholdberry_finn> the thief ring is down there though
[2:29:51] <+ChaosAethr> Wonder if 3-3 works the same?
[2:29:52] <Arisato_II> est shit
[2:29:52] <+andiwaffles> I think theres a photo mode so u technically can pause but its awkward and hard to do in the middle of combat
[2:29:53] <rcand9> yep they dont miss
[2:29:54] <%SirKeigan> ha
[2:29:57] <Meltgar> FIRE BOMB
[2:29:57] <buerdo> What about orstarva
[2:29:59] <extradopeness> DAMN
[2:30:00] <akitanito> Nice bomb
[2:30:01] <%FalseEyeD> hot hot hot hot
[2:30:02] <%SirKeigan> 3-3 will work the same
[2:30:06] <%Oncamimus> nice
[2:30:08] <IminyourBase> is that halo effect always on your character?
[2:30:09] <Arisato_II> i forgot they can throw stuff
[2:30:10] <Bonbie> I'm not certain, but I believe the thief ring might be down there though
[2:30:11] <Sigma_190_Beta> Orstarva?
[2:30:12] <TungstenViper> really, what's up with the UI?
[2:30:13] <%ZephynM> Whoa this looks cool
[2:30:15] <nah_stradamus> look, an enemy
[2:30:15] <killaholic89> @ChaosAethr i think they confirmed it will
[2:30:15] <%arkv01> show me the booba, bluepoint
[2:30:18] <Fancypants25> I gotta say with enemies not being just zombie grunts the fighting seems much more aggressive which is great
[2:30:18] <sonicblade38> didnt the dregs use to make zombie nosies?
[2:30:20] <star_feline> hey creepazoid

[2:31:29] <hassanico2> Fat Official got murdered :(
[2:31:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt when patches
[2:31:36] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Any chance you'll ever play the Diablo 2 remake in Grim Dawn?
[2:31:42] <Arisato_II> exactly same dialog
[2:31:45] <%Psych_man13_13> I really don’t like the lips moving
[2:31:46] <%ZephynM> Pat looks like a spooky ghost
[2:31:46] <%DianaTheAscian> the fact npcs jump to a blank expression so fast is kinda funny @PatStaresAt
[2:31:46] <Arisato_II> amazing
[2:31:51] <+dee_zoe> @patstaresat is that guy patches
[2:31:52] <corepercentlives> Miyazaki "we don't do that here"
[2:31:54] <%JetpackMcQuack> Pat... Patches... D:
[2:31:56] <Sapphire_Breeze> @hassanico2 rip his smile :(
[2:31:57] <DSD24> The Fat Official was supposed to look like shit anyway
[2:32:00] <rcand9> does it feel good to be back pat?
[2:32:02] <+REDtheBEAST> Its extremely strange that this area is sooo over grown.
[2:32:04] <+TheBitingIrish> I've never played Demon's Souls, what's world tendency?
[2:32:09] <jorniev> HELP THE BOI
[2:32:10] <hassanico2> @DSD24 HAPPY shit
[2:32:13] <Meltgar> @dee_zoe No, Patches is "human"
[2:32:13] <killaholic89> I wonder if they added a running jump
[2:32:14] <alphonseisbest> @PatStaresAt HOWS the dual sense feel on this/
[2:32:16] <alphonseisbest> ?
[2:32:17] <%BoxNavy> you think they sneak any goodies in this remake? maybe a sotfs style thing after you beat the game?
[2:32:22] <artoflec> yeah people defending the new fat official are out of their goddamn minds it looks like some shitty left 4 dead fan mod
[2:32:29] <SaltyAzteca> whoaa
[2:32:33] <%chiazam> The bois
[2:32:34] <+GingerStrawhat> Do you feel like you've come home Pat?
[2:32:35] <BritishTyrannosaur> is magic unlimited?
[2:32:35] <extradopeness> Hey whoa guy@
[2:32:40] <%swesterly> isn't this remaster fucking amazing
[2:32:40] <Meltgar> @artoflec Looks like nurgle decided to join Demon souls
[2:32:40] <%WhereIsWill> pat with the stabbo
[2:32:42] <rcand9> the models still glitch out the same way LUL love it
[2:32:43] <%ergulor> bitches or annoying?
[2:32:43] <DSD24> @hassanico2 True I will admit the PS3 Official was Yucking it up
[2:32:45] <jorniev> NO
[2:32:51] <hassanico2> @BritishTyrannosaur blue bar is MP
[2:32:55] <TungstenViper> @artoflec ???
[2:32:56] <Naho_Saenoki> @BritishTyrannosaur Blue meter is MP.
[2:32:58] <%JetpackMcQuack> It feels weird how good this looks
[2:32:59] <hassanico2> @BritishTyrannosaur you can get it back
[2:33:03] <+smevvster> Some of the decisions Bluepoint took with the art direction are questionable at best, fuckin baffling at worst.
[2:33:03] <Sapphire_Breeze> @TheBitingIrish world state that can change items and some enemies. you get "white" for killing bosses and "black" for killing people and dying too much
[2:33:04] <artoflec> but apparently hte OG fat official was a super blatant rip off of some berserk shit?
[2:33:04] <MyNameIsRasus> Yeah new official is really bad
[2:33:06] <%FalseEyeD> monkaS
[2:33:08] <%swesterly> the only bad thing is they didn't fix world tendency
[2:33:10] <%juxtest> @BritishTyrannosaur Theres a mana bar, but Pat has a ring that regens it
[2:33:17] <RyuuAoi> Pat, I'm bout to beat Eternal Punihment. Was it P3P or FES next?
[2:33:17] <+andiwaffles> @TheBitingIrish World Tendency works on a scale from pure white to pure black, and you move to white if you kill a boss/invader etc and you move to black if you die in human form. The darker it is the harder it is but with better drops
[2:33:19] <nmaten> damn they really nailed it so far
[2:33:19] <%G_Thunders> The old fat official looked out of place compared to literally every other enemy in the game, to be fair. I loved it personally, but you cant say it matched the design of like, anything else
[2:33:23] <randomahole> @thebitingirish changes depending on dying in body form in the world, killing a boss, etc. Makes enemies easier/harder and triggers special events
[2:33:23] <%arcielardor> Aren't you going to rescue the prince?
[2:33:24] <BritishTyrannosaur> sick, so used to using scrolls is all
[2:33:36] <corepercentlives> in a nutshell worl tendency = more you die harder the zone
[2:33:37] <hassanico2> @G_Thunders looking out of place is the point
[2:33:45] <%arcielardor> Oh you're just clearing the field of bullshit
[2:33:48] <akitanito> "Ooo"

[2:35:54] <%trustycoyote> @Klefth They kept it. Don't worry
[2:35:56] <MrYoke> Well, it's called soul arrow for a reason
[2:35:56] <%Ynkubus_> Nah, Demons Souls PC just remembers to bend their knees properly
[2:35:57] <+Nemesisnick33> @PatStaresAt did they finish the final pillar or is it still broken?
[2:36:00] <fuji_92> i wonder why

[2:36:00] <hassanico2> @XeroSigmaPrime yep
[2:36:01] <Arisato_II> god dammit, falling damage system in Souls games is soooo inconsistent
[2:36:03] <chronoxgp> you can hear the string tho
[2:36:03] <+tigerfang86> its like it' the PREQUEL TO THE UNDEAD BURG
[2:36:04] <%BoxNavy> i think this ripped that off
[2:36:05] <%ZephynM> I'm going to wait for more games to come out before I really go into getting a PS5.
[2:36:06] <0rond> undead burg looks like this
[2:36:07] <+tigerfang86> waoooooooooooooow
[2:36:09] <%BinaryFireball> because it probably is I guess
[2:36:10] <%HitchhikingThrough> Except way prettier
[2:36:10] <hassanico2> @Nemesisnick33 still broken
[2:36:10] <Naho_Saenoki> @Nemesisnick33 Still broken.
[2:36:11] <+sermittens> @PatStaresAt how long must we wait for this to come out on pc? 10 mill sold?
[2:36:15] <+play_un_squadron> undead burg looks like this
[2:36:18] <+gutlesscoward> man, this demon's souls game really ripped off dark souls. so unoriginal
[2:36:22] <%transporterthesequel> It's almost as if Dark Souls was actually a "Not Demon Souls"
[2:36:24] <Arisato_II> sooo this is the Dead Burg?
[2:36:24] <DSD24> Fall damage is the worst
[2:36:26] <JaceDarkstar> seeing this makes me hope for a ds 1 remaster
[2:36:27] <%JetpackMcQuack> That sounds neat
[2:36:27] <%코코꾸라> Good job, sir

[2:36:30] <cpl_chipmunk> Is this Anor Londo?
[2:36:32] <extradopeness> Yeah demons souls is a total ripoff of DS1 what a shame
[2:36:33] <+tigerfang86> you......... did it
[2:36:33] <%BinaryFireball> or if I recall the undead burg was reused demon souls level stuff

[2:40:21] <%KaiserMario> You'll still want to drop for the Ring though...
[2:40:22] <+andiwaffles> didn't Pat always say that magic is for babies?
[2:40:23] <%SirKeigan> Magic is Cowardman. Dial it down!

[2:40:33] <%ZephynM> Sekiro made me a fan of FromSoftware
[2:40:33] <krin_x> that spell has the most satisfying sound
[2:40:35] <chronoxgp> @dabeaminator scrolling too fast lol
[2:40:36] <rcand9> this is why spells became limited in later games chat
[2:40:40] <lethallylactic> monkaS

[2:40:55] <BliVru> Soon even memes will be Copryght
[2:40:56] <%SirKeigan> @rcand9 he also has an FP regen ring on
[2:40:59] <%T_Sasquatch> @ZephynM really ? that one ??
[2:40:59] <Parapattern> It sure is
[2:41:01] <sylveonIRL> MAGIC MISSLE
[2:41:01] <hassanico2> ABSOLUTELY BUSTED
[2:41:01] <chronoxgp> I killed sekiro
[2:41:02] <%BoxNavy> ehh i like this better its cool
[2:41:03] <%BinaryFireball> they're not limited in demon souls???
[2:41:07] <%BinaryFireball> oh shiiiiiit
[2:41:14] <TheEnemyStando> this doesnt look like 60...
[2:41:14] <chronoxgp> someone is still making games with sekiro apparently
[2:41:15] <+Donchalant402> does the remake add the password multiplayer from the more recent game? does anyone know?
[2:41:16] <%blue8moon> They're really bad about balancing magic
[2:41:19] <einSynd> They're limited by MP, and he chose the class with infinite MP regen ring
[2:41:19] <+Jaegen16> You can hold O to sprint
[2:41:20] <hassanico2> @BinaryFireball MP bar with regening MP
[2:41:21] <aeonicvector> @BinaryFireball they are, but royal gets infinite mana ring
[2:41:21] <+sermittens> @PatStaresAt you going for the moonlight great sword?
[2:41:25] <%JaydenSai> @BinaryFireball Nope, you have an MP bar
[2:41:25] <+mechslayer71> Guys, how do modded DMC 5 work out? Was it good? @cat
[2:41:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BinaryFireball you slowly regen
[2:41:27] <%ZephynM> @T_Sasquatch Yeah, I wasn't a PS3 player when I was growing up so I didn't know Demon Souls was a thing
[2:41:29] <+liquidzr0> "fair and balanced" - Sakurai
[2:41:29] <+mechslayer71> @chat*
[2:41:30] <+Nemesisnick33> not limited in DS3 either
[2:41:30] <Sapphire_Breeze> @BinaryFireball you have a mana bar but it's whatever for the most part
[2:41:31] <worsealex> Fuck I hope this comes to PC. It won't, ever. But I can still dream...
[2:41:34] <%T_Sasquatch> sekiro is great 1v1 combat, everything else is quite garbage from level design to enemy encoutners
[2:41:41] <%ZephynM> @T_Sasquatch And I like the Japanese aesthetic so Sekiro appealed to me.
[2:41:41] <frostiecrow> did you know that plague got nerf hard
[2:41:42] <+tigerfang86> THIS FUCKER

[2:41:44] <MyNameIsRasus> Magic is always either completely and utterly busted or a waste of your fucking time

[2:41:47] <hassanico2> NOOOOOOOOO

[2:56:54] <Arisato_II> of course pat wants to keep it as white as possible
[2:56:54] <huskarl_zap> Keep the realms white
[2:56:57] <thepenguinprince> What does world tendency do?
[2:56:57] <anar_bael> So dying here doesn't affect world tendancy?
[2:56:58] <SaltyAzteca> But what IS world tendency?
[2:56:58] <Meltgar> @PatStaresAt How was a way to raise it? Killing bosses and helping others?
[2:56:59] <jorniev> WE NEED TO KEEP THE WHITE UP
[2:57:00] <%Nomenanza> don't you need to have dark tendency in 1-1 to get executioner axe though?
[2:57:01] <%PaladinDupre> you could also just not die
[2:57:02] <Funky_Honkey> I still don't understand world tendency
[2:57:03] <+bassforte123> Isn't it more valuable to go to black then bounce up from the bottom when you're ready for white?
[2:57:04] <Hydrapissed> ur souls behind u

[3:03:37] <%kingmemelord97> Oh I thought we where doing yukzua again tonight ?
[3:03:47] <$Mekhet09> No.
[3:03:51] <%NecDW4> yes
[3:03:51] <@SoFarFetched> yes
[3:03:51] <+Cinnerennic> !uptime
[3:03:51] <+GingerStrawhat> I get that
[3:03:51] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 4m.
[3:03:51] <$Mekhet09> Just get the controller.
[3:03:54] <rcand9> do all games use haptics now?
[3:03:55] <%TigerCatGo> YES
[3:03:56] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt why dont you play Yakuza 7 with it?
[3:03:57] <thegusbus90210> No
[3:03:57] <%arancet> hows the rumble on pc?
[3:03:58] <%kingmemelord97> Did his ps5 come early?
[3:03:59] <%코코꾸라> @PatStaresAt Have you played Astro's Playroom?
[3:03:59] <%SaiyanShoto> It does because I'm doing the same
[3:03:59] <%R3Roundabout> Kinda
[3:03:59] <+griffball13> will you even play vahalla more than a few hours then never touch it again?
[3:04:00] <%cvp5127> makes a c into b
[3:04:00] <Arisato_II> no but yes
[3:04:01] <jorniev> KINDA
[3:04:01] <+Luna_XIV> absolutely incomprehensible, have a nice day
[3:04:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> The controller is unreal, its literally fucking cool
[3:04:03] <marvel877> PS Quintuple Ballin.
[3:04:04] <+GingerStrawhat> Again you should check out Astro if you really want to know what the Controller can do
[3:04:05] <Explodincatz> pat likes gimic big
[3:04:05] <AFlyingTaco1> You can still play the PS4 version on the PS5 though, right?
[3:04:13] <rcand9> makes sense to me
[3:04:17] <jorniev> HOW DO THE RIPOSTE FELT IN DEMON SOULS?
[3:04:18] <+LastHazzerd> Does Valhalla even utalize the DualSense features much?
[3:04:19] <%SirKeigan> What about spider-man tho
[3:04:19] <%asgard147> so yes then? limesThink
[3:04:19] <Profmcstevie> supporting ubisoft and it's sex criming horseshit for junkfood, excellent choice
[3:04:20] <%arancet> @PatStaresAt plan to test the controller rumble on pc? im curious about it
[3:04:20] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt if its that good i hope it comes in other colours
[3:04:20] <AFlyingTaco1> I do like the controller though
[3:04:21] <%SaiyanShoto> That's why I played Astro's playroom cause it uses the controller a lot
