[1:57:27] <Run44forrest> Pat Stares At (Final)
[1:57:29] <Jontman42> Playable Smash characters are called "fighters", therefore "character" can refer to any character that exists in the game in any way

[1:58:09] <+zaworldo> COstumes are not people
[1:58:12] <%DesertPenguin09> Was she so mad she left the room and that's why it was on phone call? From upstairs?
[1:58:14] <+zaworldo> nor are they characters
[1:58:19] <%BappoSama> @PeachSaliva I'm sorry Peach, i really wanted you to win.
[1:58:19] <A_Traitor> BETTER question is. what if it was the reverse and the costume was doom guy
[1:58:19] <%Shadicara> Paige is gonna have to suck some toes so she will cut them off
[1:58:22] <Soul_Intern> Even if Sans didnt got in, neither did Doomguy, so it sa giant enormous draw
[1:58:22] <%Kirby_Sauce> What did i miss?
[1:58:25] <%Dr_Mooose> ?
[1:58:28] <DracaenaLeaf> everything
[1:58:29] <derekwst3> @DesertPenguin09 she is in japan
[1:58:30] <%kiiiirsten> leans in close
[1:58:31] <+NitronStreams> the bet was which would get in first to be fair. so if doomguy doesnt show up at all I'd say Snas wins
[1:58:31] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Peach Saliva - A woman denied her victory
[1:58:31] <+zaworldo> Nobody wins, especially not paige
[1:58:32] <%joylent_blue> DesertPenguin09 nah she's over seas

[2:00:01] <ShichiNoBushi> If there are no more DLC characters, and neither Doom Guy nor actual Sans character get in, is it a win for Paige on being the closest to having her character in or is it a tie as neither of them got their character?

[2:04:59] <%GohanEgret> @Soul_Intern but the odds of the character being real after being used as a costume is low
[2:05:02] <cureneckbeard> Paige said she would eat her hat if Sans didn't get into Smash
[2:05:04] <Kejang> reflection dumbass
[2:05:05] <ShichiNoBushi> "Eat my own hat". It's an expression.
[2:05:06] <@lewdskeletor13> Paige said she would eat a hat if Sans didn’t get in
[2:05:07] <%DesertPenguin09> Paige, don't pick this as your hill to die on. It's not worth it
[2:05:07] <andersonllj92> This is so hard to watch
[2:05:09] <%skizzuto> @PeachSaliva so you admit you're deflecting right now?
[2:05:13] <ravencloak13> Watch as San’s is actually a playable character by using his 4th wall breaking powers.
[2:05:14] <+Reizie_Etherealm> At this point celebrating not being the first to lose is good enough even if he's just gonna lose later
[2:05:16] <JaerHQ> THTS RIGHT
[2:05:19] <DancePad_on_VHS> "You didn't win" has never fit more than right now
[2:05:23] <+zaworldo> Paige I hope you like the taste of hat
[2:05:23] <Dwarven_Gaming> doesnt he have gaster blasters as a default though?
[2:05:25] <%Kirby_Sauce> Gasterblasters on his hand

[2:15:19] <Mendin> You've just turned Sword Legion into a fucking wuxia chain hammer
[2:15:20] <Run44forrest> who the fuck comes here for the gameplay
[2:15:20] <@lewdskeletor13> Paige won in my heart
[2:15:24] <$arcielardor> I thought it was 8pm

[2:15:38] <ravencloak13> Oh look, were using our Stand like a ball and chain as if its a weapon. Who could have guess we’d get that?!
[2:15:39] <@lewdskeletor13> Wee woo wee woo

[2:15:39] <Wyrmsblood> Yeah but Pat won for real though

[2:15:46] <%Golinvoxx> @AngriestPat do you have baton combos yet like 360 spin attacks?
[2:15:46] <%Ion_Laser> @Frost_Quill yeah
[2:15:48] <%Dr00_PhD> do full gun combo then sync after for extra shots
[2:15:48] <Ocaz> @lewdskeletor13 but she ultimately failed to beat Pat the raid boss
[2:15:48] <ShichiNoBushi> WEEWOOWEEWOOWEEWOO!!

[2:15:58] <conflict1914> the arm one is literally just a fucking stand
[2:15:59] <@lewdskeletor13> WEEWOOWEEWOO
[2:16:01] <Derkinstacker> axe>sword>dog>arms>arrow.
[2:16:01] <+zaworldo> ROCKETO PUNCHO
[2:16:04] <Arek_1> The twitter poll question wasn't that worded clearly.
[2:16:05] <%Frost_Quill> @Ion_Laser Nice.
[2:16:05] <sonicluigi123> Still waiting for Paige to arrive
[2:16:07] <$thomassolorio> this looks dope
[2:16:09] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The hero of that one nintendo game?
[2:16:09] <mostundesired> Oh shit PogChamp
[2:16:11] <%kiiiirsten> Favorite is always Sword, pat, why are you so fucking wrong all the time
[2:16:11] <%mankeyfigh> Hey chat, did PAT READ THE FILES
[2:16:12] <+Darren716> Axe is good but moves so damn slow, you cant even wrap guys with him
[2:16:12] <+zaworldo> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:16:12] <+conradical> sword legion is still best
[2:16:14] <+Grayhammatter> holy shit
[2:16:14] <jcflyguy> WHAT
[2:16:14] <Tennochief> NICE
[2:16:17] <+Darren716> WHAT
[2:16:18] <%dekkitout> Justic! Rains from above!
[2:16:18] <+Darren716> HOW
[2:16:21] <conflict1914> oh my god i want this game now
[2:16:23] <%dukenux> LUL
[2:16:23] <Mendin> Where's Lappy
[2:16:23] <%Shadicara> Big huge
[2:16:27] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat files, cats and toilet fairy
[2:16:29] <+Darren716> I beat this and never got that
[2:16:30] <%dukenux> the fucking WEWOO Stand cry
[2:16:31] <sharkboss1> damn there are so many moves I don't know
[2:16:31] <sonicluigi123> 0_0
[2:16:31] <%SkutgruzzWarshredda> Beast is good boi
[2:16:31] <%ChaosAethr> No
[2:16:31] <OToole42> damage
[2:16:34] <$SvenHolgersson> FUCK NO
[2:16:34] <%aishman> Self Destruct is REALLY good
[2:16:35] <%Dr00_PhD> Super Armor
[2:16:36] <ravencloak13> @darren716 That’s why you have to move with him to wrap people around.
[2:16:39] <+conradical> Gene Absorb and Ittem Drop if you don't care
[2:16:39] <%arancet> i honestly want akira howard for smash after this game
[2:16:39] <%NopeBadguy> ALL ATTACK ALL THE TIME
[2:16:39] <%Louie_Salmon> It's really too much
[2:16:42] <muniea0> NTR?
[2:16:42] <KatabolicRage> I for one always attack up before utility shit
[2:16:43] <Derkinstacker> Auto chain on axe solves that, the damage output from axe is beastly with a cleaver.
[2:16:43] <Smart_ZaK1> Chain Boost is fucking good
[2:16:45] <Mendin> Parry Skill
[2:16:48] <Soul_Intern> ALL OF THE DAMAGE ALWAYS
[2:16:51] <%mankeyfigh> AUTO-SYNC
[2:16:54] <%dekkitout> You put a slowing effect on the bork last time, didn't you
[2:16:55] <%JetpackMcQuack> Look at all those numbers
[2:16:56] <%Frost_Quill> This game seems dope. For some reason I didn't like what little I saw of this game before it came out but this seems super cool.
[2:16:58] <Saltmeisterr> WEEWOO
[2:16:59] <$thomassolorio> pargon pargon pargon
[2:16:59] <Soul_Intern> GREATEST DENSE IS A SAVAGE OFFENSE
[2:17:06] <artificiallynatural> more gene codes
[2:17:06] <%mankeyfigh> AUTO-SYNC IS AMAZING
[2:17:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Auto-sync is for if you're bad at the game.
[2:17:14] <vVAstrAVv> doesn't really matter as long as you can fit both super armors on one guy
[2:17:15] <Derkinstacker> auto-sync makes you unlearn the game.
[2:17:16] <%skizzuto> you just removed the gene code boost
[2:17:16] <%Louie_Salmon> @mankeyfigh But if you're good it's does literally nothing
[2:17:16] <ravencloak13> @frost_quill But, he’s showing things shown in the trailers.
[2:17:19] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Does the self destruct show butt?
[2:17:21] <%starotter70> I personally use it cause I'm a bitch
[2:17:22] <%arancet> wow you farmed a ton
[2:17:23] <%Frost_Quill> Are you stuck with that robot or is there customization?
[2:17:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat Self-Destruct makes them blow up when the timer runs out.
[2:17:24] <derekwst3> self destruct is bad
[2:17:26] <%starotter70> Might take it off later
[2:17:27] <artificiallynatural> The timing's not hard so autosync is kinda redundant
[2:17:29] <%thunderborn32> its so early on still why not focus on xp and item drop
[2:17:36] <%JetpackMcQuack> Feels like Nier
[2:17:38] <yellowpandamilo> I CANT BELIEVE THEY PUT A SANS COSTUME IN SMASH OH MY GOD
[2:17:38] <%Shadicara> Evade
[2:17:39] <+Arcaenum> I like Crit damage builds
[2:17:42] <yellowpandamilo> I’m probably late
[2:17:43] <jcflyguy> Wait how do big Arm laser
[2:17:46] <%aishman> @AngriestPat I have a Self Destruct that's +600, it's AMAZING
[2:17:53] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @yellowpandamilo Boy howdy did you miss a shitshow
[2:17:57] <%Dante_Magnum> Dante_Magnum converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[2:17:57] <%JetpackMcQuack> 1500 chips that I'll never use thanks
[2:17:59] <%starotter70> @yellowpandamilo Oh did you miss the 30 in shouting match?
[2:17:59] <%Shadicara> Make one into your farm bot
[2:17:59] <Sphincter_Spelunker> regarding that
[2:18:00] <Derkinstacker> Slow attack on sword is good, sword is all about multi hits, you can keep them slowed.
[2:18:01] <ravencloak13> @jcflyguy Get inside him and he fires it out of it’s chest.
[2:18:02] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> SubWay200 bonus20 No, you're right. gave her a proper burial outside, where she loved to escape to, and put a sunflower in with her. The flower itself sit over her head like a little halo. She was the best black kitten. And my first real pet. RIP Kairi Michelle.
[2:18:04] <derekwst3> @yellowpandamilo not late for game but for the earlier mess yes
[2:18:07] <Arek_1> Yeah, no video game is outside the reach of Smash.
[2:18:09] <+Machomanohyeeaa> Crit and attack on everyone beside arm and make arm tanky
[2:18:09] <+zaworldo> PASSED IT
[2:18:10] <Wyrmsblood> "Sans" is trending on twitter :O
[2:18:10] <%arancet> you passed it, near the bottom
[2:18:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You went past it.
[2:18:12] <%starotter70> @yellowpandamilo 30 min*
[2:18:15] <%joylent_blue> i've had a self destruct +900% the whole game...... never used it.... guess i should.....
[2:18:16] <%Ion_Laser> @Frost_Quill You get more robots through the main story progression. And there is customization
[2:18:22] <valriot> God FUCKING DELETE THEM THEN
[2:18:23] <jcflyguy> @ravencloak13 Yeah but what's the input
[2:18:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat You can delete them if you don't like them.
[2:18:26] <sonicluigi123> Rip kitty
[2:18:27] <+ATorL> Berserk is probably better than Self-Destruct
[2:18:27] <ShichiNoBushi> Is there ever a feature to combine these Ability Codes to make better ones? They are pretty much random drops.
[2:18:28] <al0nem0nster> could always delete some of the copies.
[2:18:28] <%iwishthiswasicq> @angriestpat Just delete all the ones without a plus.
[2:18:30] <Tennochief> @TheOnlyStrayCat may she rest in peace
[2:18:33] <Arek_1> #Costume
[2:18:33] <cerass> Blind man blinds at
[2:18:43] <%mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat YOU CAN DELETE THE COPIES
[2:18:44] <+ATorL> Self-Destruct depends on the legion getting killed
[2:18:48] <+texflexrex> no more eva unit 01 legion?
[2:18:49] <+ATorL> which is pretty bad for you
[2:18:51] <%Frost_Quill> Alright I'm out, I like how this game looks which means I wanna go in blind.
[2:18:52] <+Arcaenum> Nah some are good without pluses
[2:18:55] <valriot> Hoarding At Risk
[2:19:00] <al0nem0nster> why do you need 6 call burst +30's.
[2:19:08] <+exploitativity2> @Frost_Quill it is gooood
[2:19:09] <Derkinstacker> Legit slow attack on sword is amazing.
[2:19:12] <%iwishthiswasicq> I mean, if it's good keep it. Just generally speaking.
[2:19:12] <ravencloak13> Man, wait till he see’s the ones that look like Jehutey.
[2:19:13] <%arancet> 1 slot cost abilities with 2 +s are USUALLY your best choices
[2:19:23] <%Louie_Salmon> @al0nem0nster Because you have 5 stands and might actually use all of those
[2:19:24] <+Reizie_Etherealm> If there's no limit to how many you can have then what's the point of deleting?
[2:19:26] <%1matheuw> just put damage
[2:19:28] <valriot> It's all passive anyway
[2:19:31] <%Shadicara> Tough time to minmax
[2:19:36] <al0nem0nster> Well think of it this way, Not using it is the equivalent of deleting all of them.
[2:19:40] <%thunderborn32> i still say just stack item drop rate
[2:19:43] <%Louie_Salmon> @reizie_etherealm Not having to look at a cluttered menu
[2:19:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Sword gets more skills.
[2:19:45] <%iwishthiswasicq> I hate this system too honestly, thankfully it's not even that important.
[2:19:47] <ravencloak13> @reizie_etherealm It gets crowded.
[2:19:50] <%Louie_Salmon> @al0nem0nster Not if you use it later
[2:19:52] <+Machomanohyeeaa> How you been cleaning you legion :) @angriestpat
[2:19:52] <+zaworldo> Bitch, why have them if you don't use them
[2:19:55] <+Grayhammatter> fuck, i need to play more of this, but i'm so bad at it
[2:20:01] <jcflyguy> Quick Cooldown is great if you have it
[2:20:03] <%Louie_Salmon> WHAT IF YOU USE IT LATER
[2:20:06] <%Shadicara> You'll get more later so just put whatever you fancy in
[2:20:09] <vVAstrAVv> you dont need the gene boosts not with how much youve replayed
[2:20:10] <al0nem0nster> yeah but you could just grind it later.
[2:20:19] <jcflyguy> Otherwise Anti-status ones
[2:20:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat You really don't need the gene boosts.
[2:20:24] <Smart_ZaK1> Just do attack up for now
[2:20:34] <%Louie_Salmon> But what if this is the only one that ever drops with these stats because it's random?
[2:20:35] <WRFWD> Equip any abiliy with health regen or protection against stun, fire, etc
[2:20:36] <+CaptainGrime> JUST DELETE THEM
[2:20:37] <%aishman> YOU CAN
[2:20:38] <%Ranryu692> if you don't need it now, you won't need it later

[2:21:06] <+Grayhammatter> oh snap, chain boost PogChamp
[2:21:06] <ravencloak13> You can delete the weaker versions of the things you already have though.
[2:21:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Deleting them is JUST for getting rid of ones you don't want.
[2:21:13] <+Reizie_Etherealm> You get a victory over the mind goblins, that's what you get
[2:21:14] <WhereIsWill> GOBLINS
[2:21:15] <cerass> You get gene codes
[2:21:15] <%Shadicara> Can you combine that shit like in nier?

[2:22:02] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat can you even stack the same type? why not junk the lower value ones?
[2:22:02] <ravencloak13> @louie_salmon The ones that are statistically weaker then the stronger ones you got, like + 5% to atk delete that cause you have +15% atk.
[2:22:03] <+Fyroan> so sore

[2:22:30] <derekwst3> @PeachSaliva we missed you
[2:22:30] <%Skittlesoul> Subway100 bonus10 hey what are your thoughts on yakuza 3-5 remastered? should i get it or wait for kiwami versions?
[2:22:31] <+zaworldo> IT BEGINS AGAIN
[2:22:32] <Aamoth> Pat gonna sleep on the couch for a week
[2:22:32] <%Shadicara> DAMAGE
[2:22:33] <+conradical> just straight damage pat
[2:22:33] <%DonatelloJose> I think this lady is upset?
[2:22:36] <+ATorL> Pat, just do Attack Up for now
[2:22:39] <$SvenHolgersson> WHINING FOOLS BEGONE
[2:22:40] <%Louie_Salmon> @ravencloak13 But you have 5 stands and therefore 20 slots. What if you use up all the good damage ones and STILL want more damage?
[2:22:41] <%reonome> the only salt I see is from you @PeachSaliva
[2:22:41] <%aishman> DEFENSE UP
[2:22:42] <%Luesagna00> @AngriestPat @PeachSaliva did u know that poll tweet has almost like 7k votes
[2:22:48] <cerass> Object of power [salt]
[2:22:49] <jcflyguy> Call Explosion is fun.
[2:22:51] <%starotter70> @PeachSaliva Aren't you glad that you can dress your mii character as Sans?
[2:22:56] <+conradical> tbh it doesn't matter too much
[2:22:56] <+lucaflow> Paige just destroy him when you get back
[2:22:58] <%aishman> AT LEAST PUT THE ONES WITH THE PLUS
[2:23:00] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Pat did you know about the RECYCLING MECHANIC!?
[2:23:01] <%iwishthiswasicq> ONLY POWER
[2:23:03] <$SvenHolgersson> BIG NUMBER
[2:23:03] <%miabyte> big attack
[2:23:03] <+zaworldo> WHY IS HE USING THE SMALLEST ATTACK UPS
[2:23:05] <%Dante_Magnum> the sweet chill EDM just constantly bumping in the police station is what really gets me
[2:23:06] <%Shadicara> MORE POWER
[2:23:06] <Goergorion> GET H U G E
[2:23:08] <+zaworldo> USE THE PLUS ONES
[2:23:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat Put Super Armor on Arms because he's slow and takes hits more often.
[2:23:11] <al0nem0nster> oh so you can just do attack up + 20 if you have space for the 15.
[2:23:11] <ravencloak13> @louie_salmon Then put the +20% that you also have by this point.
[2:23:12] <%JetpackMcQuack> Pog 15%
[2:23:17] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat where you can throw away LITTERING ASS HOLES SHIT
[2:23:19] <+ATorL> Effect Spread is good on Attack Up
[2:23:19] <sonicluigi123> BEEF EM
[2:23:25] <Goergorion> TIME TO GET HUGE
[2:23:27] <%SkutgruzzWarshredda> Hey pat do you know you can pet beast legion?
[2:23:28] <Smart_ZaK1> Big attack number go up
[2:23:29] <black_mages_matter_> ATTACK UP IS A DPS LOSS
[2:23:32] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @Louie_Salmon I dunno, maybe the ones that are weaker in terms of percentage increase AND has no plus bonuses? There's bound to be some that are at the bottom of the whole list in terms of quality
[2:23:32] <%Shadicara> Do the rest
[2:23:32] <+ATorL> it makes that augment contribute to all legions
[2:23:33] <%aishman> What file are you on Pat?
[2:23:35] <%starotter70> This chapter is pretty long, I think
[2:23:36] <vVAstrAVv> pat why are you just ignoring a mechanic
[2:23:37] <%Louie_Salmon> @ravencloak13 But what if there's a crazy good 3 slot ability and you want just a little damage to go with it?
[2:23:37] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Yu Narukami is in Smash you guys
[2:23:41] <%ThirdWelles> @aishman 6
[2:23:42] <%Shadicara> Need to do the rest pat LUL
[2:23:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's not.
[2:23:45] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:23:48] <Smart_ZaK1> LMAOOO
[2:23:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They're fucking with you.
[2:23:49] <ShichiNoBushi> Might as well use the ones with bonus effects rather than the vanilla ones without +'s.
[2:23:50] <KitsuneManami> Recycle Soda Cans
[2:23:54] <Derkinstacker> Thats a good file.
[2:23:54] <+zaworldo> OH GOD
[2:23:56] <%aishman> Oh I'm in that same spot, I need to go back and GRIND
[2:23:58] <%xsnowfox> oh jeez you just reminded me i have a ton of stat boosting items in FE3H and i don't know who to give them to
[2:23:58] <ravencloak13> @louie_salmon Yeah and?
[2:23:58] <+LtSergei> Geno is in smash guys
[2:24:01] <Sokumotanaka> @Sphincter_Spelunker LET THAT ASSHOLE DIE
[2:24:03] <+zaworldo> JUST DELETE THEM PAT'
[2:24:06] <%xsnowfox> i might just give them all to byleth but god
[2:24:06] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I sort them by type
[2:24:07] <Virokwet> set it and forhet it dude
[2:24:09] <ShichiNoBushi> They are essentially loot drops.
[2:24:09] <%iwishthiswasicq> Because the mechanic sucks.
[2:24:09] <+exploitativity2> i agree honestly
[2:24:11] <doggieo> Longer chain will help in some spots
[2:24:11] <zepedai> sans is in smash
[2:24:12] <Valdorick> Doing more damage is a DPS loss because the fight last shorter Kappa
[2:24:14] <+Darren716> Oh man wait for the post game
[2:24:15] <%NopeBadguy> It's the same sort of chip bloat that was in Nier
[2:24:16] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> and it makes it easier to kinda decide
[2:24:17] <%Louie_Salmon> @reizie_etherealm But even the bottom of the list might be useful because you have lots of slots!
[2:24:23] <vVAstrAVv> the plus shits all free
[2:24:29] <%1matheuw> item
[2:24:29] <KatabolicRage> it looks like a lot but it really isn't, just use the catagories
[2:24:29] <Smart_ZaK1> It's fine
[2:24:33] <%1matheuw> in frontt
[2:24:39] <%thunderborn32> @AngriestPat what makes that worse means there has to be a best in slot for each legion and its fuckin RNG
[2:24:39] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> it feels worse than the memory things in Nier though, I wish you could combine and edit them
[2:24:40] <ShichiNoBushi> Story time!
[2:24:42] <%Louie_Salmon> @ravencloak13 Then you would want 1 slot damage one instead of the better 2 slot damage one! So it's not useless!
[2:24:47] <+zaworldo> Did he just go to ng+
[2:24:51] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> there's like just a couple modifiers
[2:24:53] <%Shadicara> Too much brain for pat
[2:24:58] <%aishman> Man I'm honestly surprised how long each file lasts. Like it lasts like...2-3 hours each right?
[2:24:59] <%ThirdWelles> Well, time for me to leave because I'm on file 6 also. BYEEEEEEEEE
[2:24:59] <Derkinstacker> its not, legit just delete everyone without a +
[2:25:02] <al0nem0nster> because most are duplicates?
[2:25:02] <KatabolicRage> cos your gonna see a lot of duplicates with different plusses on em
[2:25:04] <%dekkitout> Oh right, 🌈 Lore ✨
[2:25:04] <vVAstrAVv> they mean not a lot of types
[2:25:06] <doggieo> This is a Long Chapter
[2:25:06] <Mendin> Big Lore Time
[2:25:07] <%xsnowfox> god i miss p5 music now jfc
[2:25:12] <ShichiNoBushi> @zaworldo You can freely replay different missions.
[2:25:13] <KnightAsteran> Pat confirmed too smoithbrain
[2:25:15] <Mendin> Second Impact
[2:25:18] <Soul_Intern> IT BEGINS
[2:25:22] <%dukenux> [cue Hot Fuzz extreme paperwork]
[2:25:26] <seycheles> take big notes yall
[2:25:31] <ravencloak13> No I mean yeah and as in you could do it with the hypothetical you presented @louie_salmon while deleting the weaker versions.
[2:25:35] <KatabolicRage> when you get enough to go around your legions you can start trimming the ones you dont want
[2:25:36] <poweruser> it literally doesn't matter
[2:25:37] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat delete some off stream
[2:25:39] <Soul_Intern> So TL:DR
[2:25:40] <vVAstrAVv> theres really not that much
[2:25:42] <Soul_Intern> Mind goblins
[2:25:48] <Derkinstacker> a + with something you don't want is still better than one without.
[2:25:53] <vVAstrAVv> you can take like 5 minutes lol
[2:25:54] <Sphincter_Spelunker> The Stando Arrows
[2:25:54] <%dukenux> Buraucracy, all parts of police job
[2:25:54] <+conradical> Pat, i understand you, but the abilities doesn't matter
[2:25:55] <Brainworm205> Hey pat I’m stoked for Terry Bogard thank you nintendad
[2:26:01] <Tennochief> damn it Flying Lotus
[2:26:10] <al0nem0nster> thought when most people found a loadout they like in this type of thing they just only look at the new ones in case their good then forget about them till the end of time.
[2:26:14] <Mendin> The Prophets, or... The Wise Men? It's just SEELE.
[2:26:14] <Smart_ZaK1> Red Shift is just the 2nd Impact
[2:26:18] <seycheles> very important part of the process
[2:26:21] <ravencloak13> Also Stands cause the bacteria that created Stands came from a meterotie.
[2:26:24] <vVAstrAVv> PLUSES ARE FREE
[2:26:26] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> The Legion YEET + is kinda bad tho
[2:26:27] <Soul_Intern> Mind goblins chat dont worry
[2:26:29] <%Louie_Salmon> @ravencloak13 But there's so many slots that even an objectively worse version of a chip might be useful, because you might want both the good version and the worse version.
[2:26:37] <KnightAsteran> @angriestpat BTW you probably didn't notice it but the moon is red in this game
[2:26:39] <black_mages_matter_> a mod with a + is a dps loss
[2:26:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No you don't.
[2:26:42] <vVAstrAVv> and the screen tells you what you have equipped even the plusses
[2:26:46] <ravencloak13> Not if you have more of the better version.
[2:26:48] <ShichiNoBushi> I have found Legion Rush annoying as it makes them dash when you want to nudge them especially if you are trying to Chain Jump into a narrow gap or a small platform.
[2:26:48] <al0nem0nster> wait so the moon is corrupted?
[2:26:51] <%Laecerelius> So this is the third impact?
[2:26:55] <%dekkitout> Moon's Haunted?
[2:26:56] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> like if I had an ability with the Legion tap effect to dash them I would not want that compared to one that is blank
[2:26:57] <al0nem0nster> so is this happening in all of space?
[2:27:04] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I just keep them all and sort by type
[2:27:16] <ravencloak13> No, the moons a giant computer that monitors earth.
[2:27:17] <%Louie_Salmon> @conradical It seems like +30% damage and new button inputs are things that matter a lot
[2:27:19] <%Starlight_Gamer> is this still the 1st playthrough?
[2:27:24] <valriot> Did this chapter today, it is fucking looooong
[2:27:25] <%1matheuw> yeh
[2:27:27] <%joylent_blue> yes
[2:27:28] <+CaptainGrime> @Starlight_Gamer yea
[2:27:31] <ravencloak13> @starlight_gamer Yep.
[2:27:31] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Starlight_Gamer halfway through
[2:27:35] <%Dementedpenguin> Meh, the main character hasn't had a breakdown throughout the course of the game. Kappa
[2:27:38] <%Starlight_Gamer> thanks
[2:27:41] <Charuzu> Third Impact
[2:27:54] <Valdorick> Ah yes, the story of the omnissiah
[2:27:57] <%dekkitout> Quick Latin nerds, translate that last part
[2:27:59] <TheLaw3D4> I beat this game again today, It's my Goty
[2:28:03] <TheLaw3D4> 9.999/10
[2:28:04] <gekizenbu> 2 of every human on earth on a boat
[2:28:07] <%Louie_Salmon> You mind goblin-less people are the real insane ones
[2:28:10] <Sphincter_Spelunker> All nations. Yet only Spanish, Japanese and American names
[2:28:12] <KoshiLowell> Has he met Kyle yet?
[2:28:14] <TheLaw3D4> The camera and coop make me sad though
[2:28:29] <%Louie_Salmon> My mind goblins only tell me great advice that makes me not finish games
[2:28:33] <%1matheuw> will NEVER reach
[2:28:39] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Seems like Platinum really liked Yoko Taro style archive based lore dump for them to doing it here too
[2:28:42] <sonicluigi123> The server
[2:28:49] <DSD24> @Sphincter_Spelunker There's Lei Fong and that's a chinese name
[2:28:51] <%starotter70> @KoshiLowell nah, later
[2:28:55] <sonicluigi123> PING CRIMSON
[2:28:59] <ravencloak13> @sphincter_spelunker *looks at how far out the Englands reach went out* Also Chinese.
[2:29:33] <KnightAsteran> also isn't Yoseph a Russian name?
[2:29:35] <Mendin> Oh so that one chick shooting a gate back in chapter 2 was... actually doing something productive
[2:29:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Reizie_Etherealm I dunno, Bayonetta does the same thing with the journals.
[2:29:55] <ravencloak13> @thelaw3d4 I honestly like it, especially since it’s not 2 separate screens making it useable.
[2:30:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's just a convenient way to dump lore without longwinded characters.
[2:30:08] <gekizenbu> @KnightAsteran i think its meant to actually be a JudeoChristian reference for.... really obvious reasons later
[2:30:12] <@PeachSaliva> Ttell Pat to check his phone
[2:30:14] <al0nem0nster> is this an scp log?
[2:30:14] <@PeachSaliva> it's actually important
[2:30:18] <Tennochief> Oh

[2:30:33] <cureneckbeard> oh it's not important, it's just undertale
[2:30:34] <%Louie_Salmon> @too_much_nukie But those are always a thing that opt into reading, this was a pop-up with a completion bar handed to you in a cutscene
[2:30:38] <sonicluigi123> Pat might wanna check phone
[2:30:38] <%Starlight_Gamer> is this like nier?
[2:30:38] <%reonome> is this Control

[2:30:56] <sonicluigi123> Ummm
[2:30:57] <420Fukboi420> It was a meme wasn't it
[2:30:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Louie_Salmon That's true. And they did take a lot of other things from their time with Yoko Taro.
[2:31:01] <sonicluigi123> WUT
[2:31:02] <Tennochief> @PeachSaliva did you punk him just now?
[2:31:11] <@PeachSaliva> Nope, check my twitter
[2:31:13] <%dekkitout> I now can't shake the suspicion of bleed over between Control and Astral Chain...
[2:31:15] <Tennochief> ok
[2:31:19] <@PeachSaliva> His description in the shop is written in first person
[2:31:21] <sonicluigi123> Hold up brb
[2:31:29] <TheLaw3D4> @ravencloak13 Even if it's enjoyable there is just no reason that they couldn't let both players use full controllers, and making second person controller camera is crazy
[2:31:31] <%SummonerMagno> that doesnt help you Paige, its Sans saying that is just a costume and not him
[2:31:32] <%arancet> @AngriestPat beware, this chatpro is LOOONG, even for this game
[2:31:33] <%pilgrimsayswhat> When shitposting pays off apatDab
[2:31:34] <%Spydurman> Spydurman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Hey Pat any advice when commissioning art from artists online? Might be looking for some art soon. Aww ya lucky 13 months

[2:32:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @mcjimbo12 He did when it dropped. Control Part 2.
[2:32:55] <@lewdskeletor13> Pat did you see that photoshop Paige tweeted

[2:33:11] <ravencloak13> @thelaw3d4 Cause you see them through your Stand. Also nah, you need one person to be controlling it cause no split screen and I hate split screen cause it makes the screen shit.
[2:33:11] <@PeachSaliva> lmso
[2:33:12] <%Dementedpenguin> @Piemen99 gameplay hasn't really started.... but you missed some juicy Pat/Paige interaction Kappa
[2:33:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @mcjimbo12 He watched the trailer at the end of the VOD.
[2:33:20] <%Louie_Salmon> @tennochief Well the first 40 minutes was the presentation, then an hour of arguing
[2:33:22] <sonicluigi123> 0_______________________0
[2:33:29] <%Piemen99> Damn that's the best parts
[2:33:34] <%Ge3b0t> lordy
[2:33:40] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige, go the eye doctor. You can't type
[2:33:41] <Tennochief> @Louie_Salmon thank you man
[2:33:42] <%dekkitout> Mr. Union, Tear down your wall!
[2:33:44] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Let's hope
[2:33:45] <+Jonesman64> Gillllded cage
[2:33:47] <DracaenaLeaf> Hackermen
[2:33:48] <%pectusumbra> spoilers, it''s not
[2:34:26] <Soul_Intern> THOSE 4CHAN HACKERS
[2:34:28] <ShichiNoBushi> And use two-step authentication.
[2:34:30] <ravencloak13> People would never change passwords daily.
[2:34:30] <%Ge3b0t> a skilled hacker can announce sans for smash
[2:34:39] <%wydamn> Would passwords in Japanese be more secure than passwords in English?
[2:34:43] <Valdorick> Hackers will never guess my password - NO ONE WOULD GEUESS WORDPASS
[2:34:57] <Sphincter_Spelunker> fuckingpassword
[2:35:08] <al0nem0nster> if you want an unguessable password, just intentionally missspell something .
[2:35:08] <%Ge3b0t> top security
[2:35:11] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Use a one time password gotten via email that changes every time
[2:35:20] <%wydamn> @Sphincter_Spelunker goddamit Hank
[2:35:34] <ravencloak13> @wydamn No, cause the better ones just use symbol breakers that use all forms of symbols that can be used in a password.
[2:36:07] <ravencloak13> Or write a sentence.
[2:36:17] <ravencloak13> Or paragraph.
[2:36:20] <al0nem0nster> yeah use a sentence
[2:36:20] <%Ion_Laser> Or a passphrase
[2:36:31] <%umbypokochan> pleasedontguessmypassword
[2:36:35] <Kalinflip> Dis lil ninja reading atpRtsd4
[2:36:45] <%wydamn> @ravencloak13 thanks, that makes sense. I wasn't super knowledgeable about japanese typing, so I was curious.
[2:36:46] <+McSnazzyPants> pleasedonthackmethanks
[2:36:50] <ravencloak13> Like, use a fanfic you never published as your password
[2:36:52] <al0nem0nster> doesn't it take a program like 200000 years to break a 29 or so long string password?
[2:36:57] <Valdorick> "We can't believe theyt stuck their dick into ATM-chan
[2:37:02] <%umbypokochan> sansdidntgetintosmash
[2:37:08] <%thunderborn32> i haven't paid any attention and i dont feel i've missed anything
[2:37:11] <Kalinflip> @ravencloak13 "Josephrailslisalisawithhamondick "
[2:37:13] <Kalinflip> Like that?
[2:37:15] <cureneckbeard> an english sentence is less random than 29 random letters though
[2:37:20] <Kalinflip> Id never publish that
[2:37:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> An old password I had to use was You_Can_lead_A_horse_towater_but_cant_make_H1m_Dance!
[2:37:32] <ravencloak13> Yeah, that works.
[2:37:34] <cureneckbeard> well now we know your old password
[2:37:39] <ALazo> Twin's birthday
[2:37:44] <KoshiLowell> Kyle HYPE
[2:37:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @al0nem0nster Not any 29 string password. Programs run through words and names first.
[2:37:46] <%Toynota10> @AngriestPat you want the password?
[2:37:48] <%millamoks> @AngriestPat Paige just accidentally posted official confirmation that she is wrong on her twitter. It's a screemshot of the official store screen written as if it's from Sans saying "If you want your mii to LOOK LIKE me" You should check out twitter.
[2:37:48] <%wydamn> Enter that password, Pat!
[2:37:49] <DSD24> Put in 0451
[2:37:50] <uncleofkos> pat when's dmc2 for switch stream
[2:37:52] <%Big_Dream> the birthdays of the twins
[2:37:52] <WanderingSwordsman> 1125
[2:37:54] <%1matheuw> c012?
[2:37:58] <ScreamLord> All this talk about Chimeras makes me wish Insomniac would continue or reboot the Resistance series
[2:37:58] <Soul_Intern> Chat quick
[2:38:00] <Captain_Aham> 1125
[2:38:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat It's your birthday
[2:38:01] <%Toynota10> 1125
[2:38:03] <Soul_Intern> Give password
[2:38:11] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Congrats, Paige. Ya played yourself
[2:38:11] <T3merity> 6969
[2:38:16] <ShichiNoBushi> 0000... no? 0001... 0002... 0003...
[2:38:18] <Captain_Aham> it's the twins birthday lol
[2:38:27] <%1matheuw> lol
[2:38:43] <%Ge3b0t> I mean does it matter
[2:38:45] <KatabolicRage> someone used his kids birthday as his password apparantly
[2:38:50] <+Reizie_Etherealm> She did play herself, I can't believe Paige got so overconfident that she'd limit her chances by narrowing it down like that
[2:39:06] <cureneckbeard> pat narrowed it first
[2:39:25] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I guess that just means he's not gonna win either
[2:39:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Dad :(
[2:39:36] <cureneckbeard> i'm gonna lol when doomguy gets an assist trophy
[2:39:38] <GreyFoxHoundDD> He got music in though
[2:39:48] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Half as much music as Cloud
[2:39:49] <%Ge3b0t> dante for smash
[2:39:51] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I know they shook hands and someone asked if it included costumes when they asked about the bet.
[2:40:04] <Sphincter_Spelunker> They talk about the bet all year though
[2:40:05] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Dante would be more believable I think
[2:40:11] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Maybe Vergil
[2:40:11] <cureneckbeard> No, they shook on assist trophies
[2:40:20] <Sphincter_Spelunker> That was on the VGA's
[2:40:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> Astral Chain Raccoon City
[2:40:28] <cureneckbeard> at 3h20m in the video game awards
[2:40:40] <cureneckbeard> they never clarified if costumes count
[2:40:47] <cureneckbeard> only that it has to be playable and not an assist trophy
[2:40:55] <GreyFoxHoundDD> I'd say that counts
[2:40:59] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @cureneckbeard Dude. Literally just said they talked all year about it
[2:41:00] <Valdorick> Redshit babies
[2:41:06] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Not talking about the VGA
[2:41:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yep, you're a Redshift baboo
[2:41:08] <%dekkitout> Hey, your character is a twin~
[2:41:10] <%DonatelloJose> It counts.
[2:41:12] <sonicluigi123> Same here I sat it counts
[2:41:12] <%InugamiTheHound> shit government
[2:41:17] <Tennochief> dad...
[2:41:20] <%Piemen99> oh hey its us
[2:41:22] <+CaptainGrime> GEESE
[2:41:32] <%Ge3b0t> whoops got stabbed
[2:41:36] <Valdorick> Hey wait, that means you're not blood related to you dad Kreygasm
[2:41:41] <%wydamn> Dad... :(
[2:41:43] <%thunderborn32> nothing in these reports seem to matter
[2:41:52] <cureneckbeard> you'd need to find an actual video where they shook on whether costumes count
[2:41:52] <GreyFoxHoundDD> I'm surprised Pat's not wearing his Fatal Fury Hat
[2:42:05] <TheAzureOracle> The thing Paige just tweeted kinda helps prove her wrong
[2:42:06] <Tennochief> oh god no
[2:42:20] <Soul_Intern> LAPPY!
[2:42:25] <%1matheuw> paige really isnt letting it go huh?

[2:45:07] <%happyface699> I WISH DOOM GUY WAS IN SMASH
[2:45:07] <ravencloak13> Your sister.

[2:45:43] <al0nem0nster> wonder if that hurts.
[2:45:43] <Derkinstacker> He hates it
[2:45:43] <%Laecerelius> Take care of your slaves, Pat!
[2:45:45] <%dekkitout> You repainted the gang?
[2:45:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> he hates bathtime
[2:45:48] <Derkinstacker> like a smash player being bathed.
[2:45:49] <+SoundVoid> Did Paige lose the smash bro bet?
[2:45:51] <Zombrocom> They hate you so much
[2:45:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Did Pat make the Legions look like Eva Unit 3?
[2:46:00] <$Garthunox> Yes Paige lost
[2:46:04] <cureneckbeard> Paige doesn't actually lose until Doomguy gets in
[2:46:05] <al0nem0nster> he made them match the robocop remake.
[2:46:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> You mean puple
[2:46:06] <Smart_ZaK1> Legions are like mechanical spirit boyfriends
[2:46:07] <%Ahack13> so what does maintaining legions do exactly?
[2:46:09] <%joylent_blue> they got the Nero colors going on
[2:46:12] <ne0bunny> I was dumb and kept pressing ZR over and over on this maintenance thing, didnt know you could just hold it down til like chapter 10
[2:46:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> paige making a post where sans saying he's not in smash but you can dress like him is amazing
[2:46:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> sorry
[2:46:19] <%dekkitout> They kinda do look like Unit 3
[2:46:20] <%1matheuw> oh no
[2:46:21] <$Garthunox> No Paige lost cos Sans isn't in
[2:46:23] <%Piemen99> @SoundVoid what bet?
[2:46:26] <%joylent_blue> Ahack13 it makes them hate you :)
[2:46:27] <%happyface699> SORRY I did a oops
[2:46:36] <$Garthunox> It only LOOKS LIKE Sans
[2:46:44] <+NobleJedi> Paige just inadvertently hurt her own argument LUL
[2:46:49] <+zaworldo> He knows that HAND legion does the most damage
[2:46:52] <+SoundVoid> The bet was if sans or doom guy will be a playable character in smash
[2:46:59] <%1matheuw> wouldnt doomguy be a better gunner skin anyway?
[2:47:01] <%happyface699> I sent someone something by accident
[2:47:04] <sonicluigi123> Ah ok then
[2:47:07] <graemecrackers1> Peach are you all caught up on This Is Us?
[2:47:07] <+SoundVoid> Not a costume or assist trophy
[2:47:09] <%joylent_blue> to be fair it was a poorly articulated bet
[2:47:10] <cureneckbeard> gonna lol when doomguy gets in as a gunner skin
[2:47:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> and neither are playable in smash
[2:47:18] <+zaworldo> WHY DOES HE NOT USE 100%
[2:47:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> So I missed the announcement is terry in?
[2:47:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @1matheuw Not with how the gunner skins work. It's an arm-cannon thing.
[2:47:22] <$Garthunox> Yeah Paige super hurt her own arguement
[2:47:23] <%happyface699> Paige lost I feel
[2:47:23] <%BoboDaHobo> oh wait this is the complicit chapter right? this one is one of the best!
[2:47:29] <GreyFoxHoundDD> What if Sans Was in Smash Ultimate Haha just kidding Unless?
[2:47:31] <%Ion_Laser> @doc_ock_rokc yes
[2:47:31] <Smart_ZaK1> He did it
[2:47:32] <vVAstrAVv> laaazy lol

[2:47:41] <sonicluigi123> *yup
[2:47:42] <vexion_smh> Paige hasn't lost lmfao
[2:47:43] <mybigmeech> @doc_ock_rokc Yeah, and sans is a costume
[2:47:44] <+NobleJedi> WAY worse LUL
[2:47:45] <Derkinstacker> This chapter is great.
[2:47:45] <J3tstream98> This game any good?
[2:47:46] <%starotter70> It's also pretty long
[2:47:49] <%joylent_blue> it took me an entire afternoon
[2:47:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat This is THE best chapter imo. Granted I've only seen it not played it.
[2:47:51] <Tennochief> how worse?
[2:47:52] <%d00msdaydan> so what happens if they announce doomguy, but he's also a costume?
[2:47:54] <$Garthunox> Doomguy could still be in, lotsa DLC left
[2:47:55] <al0nem0nster> huh, item by the coffee table, who keeps littering in the station?
[2:47:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> paige made a post where she quote tweets sans saying you can dress like him
[2:47:59] <%Laecerelius> Just gotta mash!
[2:48:00] <%1matheuw> i think theres an item on the last room
[2:48:01] <%joylent_blue> J3tstream98 its fantastic
[2:48:02] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @d00msdaydan Chat wins
[2:48:02] <%happyface699> @tennochief Check twitter
[2:48:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> @mybigmeech I heard that from the people fighting if paige won or not
[2:48:10] <%Laecerelius> Treat yo self!
[2:48:10] <%Ge3b0t> time to buy a switch for this game
[2:48:10] <KoshiLowell> Kyle HYPE Kyle HYPE
[2:48:13] <%dekkitout> Treat yoself, gurl
[2:48:15] <Arek_1> @AngriestPat The twitter poll question was weirdly worded.
[2:48:16] <J3tstream98> Ah, good to know
[2:48:25] <mybigmeech> @doc_ock_rokc Oh, my bad LUL
[2:48:28] <sonicluigi123> I really wanna get this
[2:48:30] <%starotter70> So Sans HIMSELF, says he's not in smash?
[2:48:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> How much does Bel shit in a day that they need all this toilet paper?
[2:48:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Johnny, is that you?
[2:48:36] <sidstyler> zoneBurg
[2:48:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @mybigmeech no it is fine
[2:48:37] <cureneckbeard> calling it now, doomguy is going to be a gunner costume, fifth dlc will be Quote from Cave Story
[2:48:40] <%joylent_blue> @AngriestPat i think if you re-worded the twitter poll you'd get a different result
[2:48:49] <Derkinstacker> elevator is so fast.
[2:48:54] <cureneckbeard> the twitter poll was totally ambiguously worded
[2:48:58] <%reonome> sans himself is telling paige shes wrong LUL
[2:49:00] <+Jaromero435> Does Pat know there are illusory walls in this game?
[2:49:02] <al0nem0nster> Have they already done a motorcycle fight with your stand?
[2:49:09] <tank7013> @starotter70 If that update message is real then actually yes
[2:49:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Jaromero435 Don't do this if you're not telling the truth
[2:49:15] <Derkinstacker> Yes
[2:49:16] <%starotter70> LUL
[2:49:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> wha
[2:49:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> NotLikeThis
[2:49:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> oh
[2:49:22] <RupanSen> @reonome LUL
[2:49:22] <Derkinstacker> holographic walls
[2:49:22] <%Louie_Salmon> NOOOOOO
[2:49:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oh NO
[2:49:23] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Wait, seriously? Fuck
[2:49:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Fuck me.
[2:49:31] <+Jaromero435> yeah there are walls
[2:49:36] <sonicluigi123> Huh
[2:49:39] <%starotter70> Oh
[2:49:39] <+SolverCODO> Did Pat see that Sans Undertale is LITERALLY, ACTUALLY in Smash now? as a mii skin
[2:49:41] <%starotter70> Damn it
[2:49:42] <%happyface699> Do we all agree the plague tales ending is just a stand battle?
[2:49:44] <%Laecerelius> Oh no
[2:49:47] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Are they Stand blocked? or just run up and hit them with anything
[2:49:48] <sonicluigi123> RIGHT then LUL
[2:49:48] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Well, there goes the rest of this evening
[2:49:52] <%Louie_Salmon> Well, time to face-fuck every wall ever. Awesome
[2:49:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @doc_ock_rokc better finish that playthrough you're on so you can replay it LUL
[2:49:54] <%starotter70> Time to go back then
[2:49:55] <%boondoggle42> but has anyone told Woolie, forcing him to rub his dick against every surface in the game?
[2:49:55] <+Jaromero435> I've only found one as well
[2:49:56] <%reonome> @solvercodo you dont even know man
[2:49:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SolverCODO yes and he isn't in the game
[2:49:56] <al0nem0nster> Well I tried to warn him about crazy talk
[2:50:02] <%dekkitout> @happyface699 Yeah we covered that hard
[2:50:04] <%joylent_blue> Sphincter_Spelunker you just walk through them, they're holographic
[2:50:04] <cureneckbeard> Now you have to check every wall for illusory walls
[2:50:06] <Arek_1> @AngriestPat The answer "It counts" is your answer to that particular question, right? Fucking double negatives...
[2:50:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Admiral_PopnFresh I don't have the game yet!
[2:50:09] <Sphincter_Spelunker> gotcha
[2:50:11] <artificiallynatural> fuck now I have to find the damn hidden walls
[2:50:17] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Banjo is out now btw
[2:50:18] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @doc_ock_rokc then no worries!
[2:50:20] <TheFilth> HOES MAD
[2:50:23] <Sphincter_Spelunker> yet another point towards getting FE instead
[2:50:32] <Derkinstacker> IRIS doesnt see them either, you gotta look for static on a wall
[2:50:42] <%starotter70> Yes
[2:50:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> poll?
[2:50:43] <Derkinstacker> in the levels they exsist someone will mention something weird.
[2:50:44] <+thefruggler> Yes
[2:50:45] <+zaworldo> PAT LEAVE IT ALONE
[2:50:45] <%Jeemukun> something fucky is gonna happen and they aren't even being subtle about it
[2:50:45] <+dante_must_die_exe> re word the poll
[2:50:46] <sonicluigi123> @sphincter_spelunker I already got FE anyways
[2:50:46] <DracaenaLeaf> YEs
[2:50:47] <poweruser> yes do it right
[2:50:48] <vVAstrAVv> NO
[2:50:48] <+HyperCharge_Sam> PAT LUL
[2:50:48] <%joylent_blue> contextualize it
[2:50:49] <+Artimadare> VoteYea

[2:51:04] <+Jaromero435> I dont remember the bet
[2:51:04] <holydeviant1> @AngriestPat Do you have any advice for dodging? Cerberus felt almost unfair with the roar+jump.
[2:51:04] <+zaworldo> PLAY THE GAME
[2:51:05] <startstoprepeat> no doomguy, you sure as shit didn't win
[2:51:05] <%starotter70> Neither
[2:51:06] <%EtheralFlameX> YOu didn't win but paige lost
[2:51:07] <Smart_ZaK1> But the bet wasn't won yet?
[2:51:08] <+HyperCharge_Sam> I guess Skullkid and Geno are in smash too
[2:51:12] <+Fortunato5678> You didn't win yet, Doomguy isn't in
[2:51:12] <%MoulesFritz> @AngriestPat you know we're going to dunk on you on principle, right?
[2:51:12] <+Reizie_Etherealm> No one won
[2:51:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> I love paige more then you...but You won
[2:51:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> nobody, unless Doomguy is actually in the game
[2:51:15] <%joylent_blue> make "chat wins" an option
[2:51:16] <%joylent_blue> :)
[2:51:17] <+SoundVoid> Technically pat hasn’t won yet
[2:51:21] <nevan0> LUL
[2:51:29] <%stagemage> put a neither option because no doomguy or sans playable characters
[2:51:31] <+SoundVoid> No word on doom guy
[2:51:36] <%xsnowfox> i'm gonna go drink and draw; good luck salty man
[2:51:39] <%joylent_blue> ???? the fuck
[2:51:41] <%Louie_Salmon> Weird
[2:51:43] <cureneckbeard> pat doesn't win until doomguy gets in as a playable character
[2:51:44] <VJdarkworld> ohhh damn i didnt know that o_O
[2:51:44] <holydeviant1> >Redoing the poll
[2:51:45] <+thefruggler> HUH

[2:51:47] <%SergeantSov> Stylis back dodges
[2:51:56] <ravencloak13> Can’t you just chain him up?
[2:51:59] <tanarath> pat, you'll lose on principal if you redo the poll.
[2:52:06] <Sphincter_Spelunker> "Do we wanna reall Brexit?" @holydeviant1
[2:52:10] <Sphincter_Spelunker> really*
[2:52:10] <Smart_ZaK1> It is like the opposite of dark souls
[2:52:11] <%thunderborn32> it IS possible for them to both lose the bet
[2:52:20] <VJdarkworld> Sarah and Main Character be like "........."
[2:52:22] <%DesertPenguin09> Still talking about the damn bet...
[2:52:23] <al0nem0nster> do they have a Lappy voice pack for the Iris?
[2:52:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hal isn't here
[2:52:26] <vVAstrAVv> fuck dodging. upgrade the legatus get super armor and eat hearts
[2:52:32] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Pls let Doomguy also be a Mii Gunner costume
[2:52:34] <%Ahack13> okay, because spinn attacks in this game seemed like total bullshit
[2:52:37] <sonicluigi123> Hal not here?
[2:52:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> really octacon
[2:52:40] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Is Hal the toilet faerie
[2:52:41] <sonicluigi123> HE IS
[2:52:42] <holydeviant1> Ooooh! Backwards are better. THanks.
[2:52:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> REALLY
[2:52:51] <%Ahack13> so roll only backwards
[2:52:54] <jcflyguy> Oh ti's THIS chapter.
[2:52:58] <GreyFoxHoundDD> 9S?
[2:53:03] <%akhos> @AngriestPat prepare this chapter is long
[2:53:04] <%InugamiTheHound> hal? Hal Emmerich?
[2:53:06] <%starotter70> @GreyFoxHoundDD Ye, same VA
[2:53:07] <sonicluigi123> @greyfoxhounddd yup!!
[2:53:07] <ravencloak13> Yes, 9S
[2:53:07] <+SoundVoid> It’s more likely that doom guy will be a costume
[2:53:10] <%pilgrimsayswhat> That's totally 9S
[2:53:11] <Sphincter_Spelunker> So Hal is just Otacon and Johnny together? @sonicluigi123
[2:53:14] <spardanwarrior> Did Pat figure out the password for those files?
[2:53:16] <hassanico1> FAKE NEWS?!
[2:53:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Delicious drugs
[2:53:22] <+The_Butterfly_Man> at this point I would say wait for all the characters to come out and if no doom guy then paIge wins
[2:53:24] <GreyFoxHoundDD> MY BOI! MY BEAUTIFUL TINY BOI
[2:53:27] <Arek_1> The choices are "agreeing with Pat" and "Paige wins."
[2:53:30] <ravencloak13> @spardanwarrior People told him.
[2:53:34] <PeachJars> ok im late but GIVE PAIGE JUSTICE
[2:53:38] <sonicluigi123> @sphincter_spelunker kinda yeah
[2:53:40] <PeachJars> PAIGE DESERVES JUSTICE I WILL SHED BLOOD OVER THIS
[2:53:43] <%starotter70> @Arek_1 Either way, we lose
[2:53:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @InugamiTheHound legally distinct hal
[2:53:52] <gryffinp> Wow, pat's text crawl is so slow, that's crazy
[2:53:55] <+Jaromero435> Drugs you say?
[2:54:01] <%happyface699> Oh hey peach
[2:54:06] <%stemlo_> @AngriestPat I made you a funny twitter meme
[2:54:07] <hassanico1> ...what
[2:54:07] <VJdarkworld> deus ex saintrPoggers
[2:54:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PeachJars Paige herself tweeted prove that she was wrong.
[2:54:16] <%millamoks> extra compounds? Are the drugs made of chimeras or seomthing?
[2:54:17] <%1matheuw> is this vaccines cause the diseases?
[2:54:20] <sonicluigi123> Oh F LUL
[2:54:20] <hassanico1> Drugs that cause the disease they're supposed to stop?
[2:54:29] <%1matheuw> this sound like antivaxx propaganda
[2:54:30] <%SummonerMagno> shes posting evidence against herself
[2:54:33] <%dekkitout> The soylent green is chimera! WutFace
[2:54:40] <PeachJars> PAIGE ISNT WRONG SHE NEVER WILL BE @Too_Much_Nukie
[2:54:41] <%happyface699> @peachjars she dug her own grave
[2:54:44] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @PeachJars rabble rabble rabble
[2:54:50] <%starotter70> She so wrong
[2:54:51] <+NitronStreams> HACKERMANS
[2:54:55] <hassanico1> RIP Robin Hood
[2:54:57] <+Jaromero435> The drugs saved your life, but made your peepee smaller so they had to get rid of them
[2:54:59] <hassanico1> Gone before his time
[2:55:04] <al0nem0nster> Sure, trust a machine's opinion on hackers.
[2:55:13] <TheLaw3D4> This case is a fun change of pace. But this game just keeps getting better
[2:55:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Hal isn't a machine.
[2:55:13] <hassanico1> uh
[2:55:13] <Mendin> Ooh, apparently Yoko Taro is going to play Control. That'll end well
[2:55:20] <%1matheuw> who would want to live with a smaller peepee
[2:55:22] <gryffinp> I gotta say I really appreciate that in like the FIRST briefing you get after the tutorial sequence the commander is just like "Yeah the legions are literally just chimeras we chained up, no bullshittin here"
[2:55:22] <hassanico1> where we were "born" huh
[2:55:25] <al0nem0nster> that's what it wants you to think
[2:55:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Hal is a shut-in talking through a robot.
[2:55:31] <valriot> Yoko Taro playing Control sounds wild
[2:55:31] <KatabolicRage> hal aint a machine, he's just a massive nerd who refuses to go outside, so he interacts via drone
[2:55:32] <hassanico1> Did dad marry a chimera
[2:55:41] <%dekkitout> Yoko Taro? Play Control? Gimme the deets PopCorn
[2:55:41] <gekizenbu> dad addopted you from hell
[2:55:43] <sonicluigi123> Stream keeps lagging in intervals for me
[2:55:45] <%arancet> 9socon
[2:55:48] <valriot> @katabolicrage So Pat?
[2:55:49] <%miguelrod777> is yoseph your dad?
[2:55:53] <%1matheuw> dad stuck his dick on a chimera on the very least
[2:55:54] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Dad married a Chimera?Are we Ichigo?
[2:55:55] <SpellCatty> hal must have some real good connection to bridge dimensions
[2:55:55] <%joylent_blue> he has a blindfold
[2:55:57] <+Jaromero435> Dad is dad
[2:56:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @arancet ...Get out of my head
[2:56:03] <%pilgrimsayswhat> What about zone 2B?
[2:56:04] <TheLaw3D4> It's 9s
[2:56:06] <%happyface699> Screw sans and doom guy, I want condemned 2 bear
[2:56:07] <%wydamn> He's basically a more reclusive version of Otacon.
[2:56:09] <Mendin> That's pretty much it, he just tweeted that he was exctied to start playing it soon
[2:56:11] <hassanico1> I'M GOING IN - Hackerman 2019
[2:56:12] <+Jaromero435> Didn't your dad adopt you?
[2:56:13] <%starotter70> hey...
[2:56:14] <sonicluigi123> Just did Pat no worries
[2:56:17] <+Pecker_Wizard> Astral butts
[2:56:20] <+NitronStreams> Otaconines
[2:56:29] <%thunderborn32> oh get it zone 09 and hes 9s
[2:56:29] <%Blitz_king01> Blitz_king01 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hey Pat, Happy subaversary! Surprised Paige is happy to settle on a costume and not a proper Sans character with full moveset and stage with multiple songs. Oh well. Take care and give da baby a pet for me!
[2:56:32] <VJdarkworld> FUCK THA GOVERNMENT PunOko
[2:56:33] <%miguelrod777> yeah max is ap9dt
[2:56:49] <cureneckbeard> I bet his imouto is in Sector V
[2:56:54] <hassanico1> We're too special
[2:56:54] <Sphincter_Spelunker> oh, I didn't even notice the hologram
[2:56:58] <KoshiLowell> oh they absolutely will lmao
[2:56:58] <%king_wragles> You can't arrest the protagonist!
[2:57:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's time to break all the rules and be a renegade cop Pat!
[2:57:03] <+Jaromero435> Can't they just give your thing to someone else?
[2:57:09] <Zombrocom> I mean, until they turn your sister into red cop
[2:57:11] <+thefruggler> Haha...unless?
[2:57:12] <%nmaten> ...unless?
[2:57:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Better start smoking and wearing a leather jacket.
[2:57:17] <KoshiLowell> ....unless?
[2:57:20] <ghostpalacio> loose cannon pat
[2:57:20] <+mugwugsampoo> ...unless?
[2:57:21] <hassanico1> @Jaromero435 we're the best user because we're better at it than others for some reason
[2:57:21] <%joylent_blue> nah its synced up to your bio signs or some shit
[2:57:23] <Soul_Intern> Lietaly haha unless
[2:57:24] <Kerozero> Pats cartoon version looks like a ginger DSP
[2:57:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> 9s to a t
[2:57:28] <al0nem0nster> now that I think of it exactly what does it look like to normal people when you ride inside the punch stand?
[2:57:38] <KatabolicRage> you look like your floating
[2:57:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @al0nem0nster You float
[2:57:43] <keiji_maede> SOOO ANIIIIIME!
[2:57:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is more nines then nines was
[2:57:45] <gekizenbu> @al0nem0nster that actually gets mentioned in a sidequest
[2:57:46] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Jaromero435 The Legion? Not really. We've got the best "sync" ever recorded. We go SSJ Blue
[2:57:46] <%miguelrod777> he wamts that D
[2:57:51] <+Tyonidus> so wtf is this game's gameplay like? I've seen approximately none of it lol
[2:57:51] <al0nem0nster> so you become a floating death god shooting lazers from nowhere? neat.
[2:57:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And when you ride the dog stand it looks like you're in a Gmod video.
[2:57:54] <Datsanegg> But hair
[2:57:54] <ravencloak13> And you float while riding the dog Stand.
[2:57:55] <%InugamiTheHound> its that lappy dog running icon?
[2:57:57] <TheLaw3D4> I would destroy dat 9s booty
[2:58:04] <%starotter70> @InugamiTheHound ye, it's the fast travel
[2:58:08] <ravencloak13> @al0nem0nster They wouldn’t see the lasers.
[2:58:09] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Boolshiet
[2:58:09] <ghostpalacio> this game looks great
[2:58:11] <gekizenbu> time to become a loose cannon cop that doesn't play by the rules
[2:58:17] <%dekkitout> Motorcycle-chan
[2:58:33] <%Tearonex> @angriestpat Yo man, I’m on vacation atm, but I’m just popping in to tell you Peach is totally correct, love ya both
[2:58:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> I can't wait for Holograms
[2:58:36] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Time to load up your 9mm pistol in an era where everyone uses lasers
[2:58:36] <%happyface699> Kazuma cycle
[2:58:38] <al0nem0nster> shame. that being said since your stand can interact with the world around it,can it wear a costume, can it wear a lappy costume.
[2:58:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Damn it Pat you're out of line! Give me your badge and your stand!
[2:58:42] <TheLaw3D4> It's not like anyone could actually have a thing for stinky girls like Jena
[2:58:42] <%InugamiTheHound> @starotter70 that's so cute and I love it
[2:58:43] <%miguelrod777> TURN IN YOUR X BATON
[2:58:43] <TheLaw3D4> Unless
[2:58:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> We are gonna do all kinds of stupid shit with them
[2:59:01] <AmericanaRed> thanks subway

[3:22:52] <mujahideenfruityrebels> The backdown
[3:22:53] <%wydamn> The fewer scoops, the easier it is to manage.
[3:22:54] <%dukenux> Four large scoops for 500 yen? thats a steal
[3:22:54] <ravencloak13> Wow, 4 scoops cost that much?
[3:22:54] <al0nem0nster> meh, it's anime food.
[3:22:54] <%worldbrand> watch out for shredder
[3:22:55] <%Gogogolem> Sir you appear to have bought twelve gallons of ice cream in five minutes.

During your Outer Wilds streams people recommended Antichamber, which I'll echo (probably a one-off or off-time game though, tbh). Simply: It's a puzzle game made entirely of impossible space
[3:23:17] <%wydamn> @ravencloak13 That inflation for you in the near-apocalypse

[3:31:35] <Goergorion> @AngriestPat They would know it was you, who ELSE has Glowy magic chains?
[3:31:36] <ALazo> I did this section without binding people save for the last guy. I regret it.
[3:31:36] <42nfl19> METAL GEAR
[3:31:37] <%1matheuw> but still they would be able to recognize stand effects
[3:31:37] <%wydamn> THAT WAS FUCKING LUCKY
[3:31:46] <ravencloak13> @twitchyal Oh, I have no idea then.
[3:31:48] <%alexandrecau> invisible or not they probably know how the cops stun people with their legion
[3:31:48] <ghostpalacio> metal snear

[3:32:02] <%dukenux> Solid Clam

[3:32:26] <$twitchyal> @AngriestPat Hey I just donated 100 bits I think and the thing didn't pop up or I missed it.
[3:32:32] <cerass> Use punch to fly
[3:32:35] <ravencloak13> @alexandrecau They don’t actually. Neruon hasn’t actually said how it’s done so normal cops don’t know about your Stand.
[3:32:37] <+CaptainGrime> @alexandrecau i doubt that just because they know about the legion things doesnt mean they are trained on how they work
[3:32:38] <+Gutseki> E V I L P A T
[3:33:00] <%alexandrecau> but they know cop can stun you
[3:33:02] <ravencloak13> Also again, they can’t even see the chain.
[3:33:03] <iaraCatunda> can you costumize your sibling?
[3:33:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> When you were a normal cop you didn't know anything about stands or chimaeras.
[3:33:06] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @twitchyal He only reads 500+. Supposed to cut down on talky time. But the people who sent messages before just send the same quantity of messages
[3:33:08] <%mr_dream__> thanks for all the content over the years gamer apatDab
[3:33:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It just falls with style.
[3:33:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @iaraCatunda No
[3:33:22] <%starotter70> It kinda hovers
[3:33:26] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Glides?
[3:33:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Arrow has longer chain

[3:33:36] <%wydamn> @Too_Much_Nukie Is that... a Toy Story reference?
[3:33:38] <rubbishbinge> Punch glides like knuckles
[3:33:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Arrow has the longest chain by default this is true.
[3:33:41] <%Blitz_king01> Falls with Style
[3:33:41] <TheLaw3D4> You can hold b while wearing punch. Noy flying but can be useful
[3:33:45] <%alexandrecau> like what is the alternative to suddenly I just dropped dead
[3:33:46] <TheLaw3D4> Hold dodge
[3:33:47] <Strider222> i want astral chain with haff life SFX
[3:33:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @wydamn Yes
[3:33:48] <Kerozero> nice
[3:33:49] <%Dr_Mooose> gap
[3:33:51] <Soul_Intern> nice
[3:33:54] <$twitchyal> cheer500 You should have focused on the Iced Cream's Z fighting. Also put LSD in the ice cream then give it to the Child and yell NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE with your stand in her face.
[3:33:54] <%SummonerMagno> apatWhat
[3:33:55] <ravencloak13> @dekkitout That’s cause it doesn’t have feet. You need to be his tiny fert.
[3:33:55] <Mendin> Nailed it
[3:33:58] <sonicluigi123> niceo
[3:33:59] <%1matheuw> stupid gap
[3:34:00] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Get ready for Grade A Platforming
[3:34:07] <%mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat You are being GRADED RIGHT NOW
[3:34:11] <%starotter70> @AngriestPat There's a chest on the bottom right of the area on top of the rafters, has something interesting
[3:34:27] <ravencloak13> @twitchyal Came up.
[3:34:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Don't worry about your grade though.
[3:34:36] <Nillard> Astral Chain being reported at completely sold out in Japan
[3:34:38] <%worldbrand> dont worry about it you'll probably do it again later
[3:34:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> can they see...stands?
[3:34:47] <+Darren716> As long as you dont get caught youll get an S+
[3:34:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No.
[3:34:47] <%starotter70> Nah
[3:34:49] <al0nem0nster> nope.
[3:34:51] <ravencloak13> No, they don’t have there own.
[3:34:52] <sonicluigi123> nope
[3:34:53] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Age hasn’t slowed you down
[3:35:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Only stand users or people with special glasses can see stands.
[3:35:01] <ravencloak13> They can hear it fucking roar though.
[3:35:03] <%ElenaManetta> I want more Legion interactions like that
[3:35:11] <tank7013> The stands probably give off a shimmer like how they mentioned chimera sometimes do, and what you see in the first mission
[3:35:18] <TheLaw3D4> @ravencloak13 They can't though?
[3:35:20] <ravencloak13> Pat: “Pull me across slave!”
[3:35:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> thats videogame cool
[3:35:26] <al0nem0nster> okay so if a stand can still fly while pulling you on a floating platform, you should be able to just fly with it.
[3:35:28] <$twitchyal> @ravencloak13 Sweet, I wish I could stay to hear him say my comment twice I guess, but I got to leave. Pat is best angry ginger.
[3:35:35] <%ElenaManetta> The fighting is cool but I like a lot of these puzzle mechanics with your slave stand
[3:35:48] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Why does this remind me of those LEGO game puzzles?
[3:35:52] <ravencloak13> @al0nem0nster *sigh* Game balance, am I right?
[3:36:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @al0nem0nster but its not supporting your weight
[3:36:05] <sonicluigi123> Niiiiice
[3:36:07] <al0nem0nster> @ravencloak13 you're right.
[3:36:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Good job knocking all those police out!
[3:36:11] <ne0bunny> @AngriestPat there is an audio options upgrade hidden in this area high up
[3:36:19] <%ElenaManetta> Victimless crime
[3:36:23] <42nfl19> omg don't call them slaves! Call it enforced work program!
[3:36:26] <WanderingSwordsman> on to the 2nd part
[3:36:32] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Indentured Stands
[3:36:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ElenaManetta except for all the victims
[3:36:34] <%dekkitout> Anyone's notices? They've all been Arkham'd
[3:36:34] <%alexandrecau> @al0nem0nster noot enough contempt in asking a stand to just carry you, you need a tuk tuk
[3:36:35] <%hussdogrob> they might notice though
[3:36:38] <ravencloak13> @42nfl19 But that’s longer!
[3:36:39] <%wydamn> @ElenaManetta truth. Can't be a victim if they're unconscious
[3:36:39] <%starotter70> ye
[3:36:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Missed a chest.
[3:36:49] <TheLaw3D4> @al0nem0nster Well, a floating platform wouldn't pull it downward. but your weight would
[3:36:50] <KoshiLowell> did Pat find the tsundere shop yet
[3:36:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He did.
[3:36:55] <ravencloak13> He did.
[3:36:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> iris
[3:36:57] <KoshiLowell> yesss
[3:37:00] <%wydamn> Is it an option for a new IRIS voice?
[3:37:02] <tanarath> Did Pat steal that one guard's meds via civil asset forfiture?
[3:37:06] <KoshiLowell> now i gotta find it
[3:37:09] <KoshiLowell> i hope someone clipped it
[3:37:22] <mujahideenfruityrebels> I like it when Platinum has money too
[3:37:24] <%wydamn> DEAD
[3:37:25] <%starotter70> You did it
[3:37:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> arrow
[3:37:39] <ravencloak13> Its in the second area dude. How did you not find the Tsudere vending machine?
[3:37:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If only you had longer chains.
[3:38:05] <al0nem0nster> @TheLaw3D4 but it's able to pull you back up after you fall down a cliff, meaning it can support several times your weight since it'd have to produce twice the amount of kinetic energy you currently have falling to instantly pull you back up like that.
[3:38:06] <%wydamn> Shy Vending Machine is best waifu
[3:38:29] <Daxalog> Is the game still holding up?
[3:38:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This platforming is more puzzle based than skill based.
[3:38:31] <%starotter70> Bugged Vending Machine is best
[3:38:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Daxalog Boy is it.
[3:38:45] <%wydamn> PICK UP THAT CAN, GORDON
[3:39:00] <TheLaw3D4> @al0nem0nster No, you actually specifically switch to sword legion in order to get pulled upward
[3:39:24] <%BoboDaHobo> go up ladder and jump to the cat walk on the right side
[3:39:25] <Soul_Intern> And oh yeah this music is super MG
[3:39:27] <DevinMayCry> Oh at the metal gear
[3:39:30] <Sphincter_Spelunker> So why can't you just swing on the chain while your Legion anchors in mid-air
[3:39:37] <%starotter70> To your left
[3:39:38] <ne0bunny> its around here
[3:39:42] <+McSnazzyPants> @angriestpat tip, if you see a ladder icon on your minimap but don't see one around look up for a snipeable one
[3:39:45] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Very Metal Gear
[3:39:47] <ne0bunny> its on a beam
[3:39:52] <spardanwarrior> It's in the corner
[3:39:54] <ne0bunny> in corner
[3:39:59] <ravencloak13> Because that make too much sense for the videogame @sphincter_spelunker
[3:40:01] <ne0bunny> go back to ladder area
[3:40:02] <ghostpalacio> i miss freedom wars
[3:40:05] <Sphincter_Spelunker> darn it
[3:40:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> We can't do left and right when you rotate the camera like that.
[3:40:13] <Valdorick> I haven't been watching, when did Pat become a Yugioh playing hobo?
[3:40:17] <Soul_Intern> WOW YEAH THIS MUSIC IS SUPER METAL GEAR
[3:40:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> ACES.
[3:40:26] <Malziel> LUL
[3:40:27] <%1matheuw> thats bullshit
[3:40:27] <nevan0> LOL
[3:40:27] <%dekkitout> @Sphincter_Spelunker I bet a bird legion would be able to do that PunOko
[3:40:28] <%starotter70> Great job
[3:40:28] <ne0bunny> LUL
[3:40:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> Too much enthusiasm

[3:40:32] <sonicluigi123> LUL
[3:40:34] <ghostpalacio> good work dummy
[3:40:35] <ALazo> Same thing happened to me
[3:40:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> S+ platforming.
[3:40:40] <Jack964b> Is this Let It Die II? (joking)
[3:40:41] <%BoboDaHobo> the chain jumps are super fucky
[3:40:44] <Valdorick> baller
[3:40:45] <TheLaw3D4> That is bullshit crazy
[3:40:48] <ALazo> There are times when the platforming really annoys me
[3:40:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Jack964b kinda
[3:40:52] <mujahideenfruityrebels> I can totally hear “HQ respond”
[3:40:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Maybe in Astral Chain 2 you'll have a bird legion that can shoot fireballs.
[3:40:56] <+McSnazzyPants> still my heart is blazing
[3:41:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Too_Much_Nukie and trashtalks
[3:41:17] <Superbro64> Chain jumps work 80 percent of the time, in my experience
[3:41:18] <KoshiLowell> "BAHBEQUE TIEM"
[3:41:20] <%Blitz_king01> You Did It
[3:41:20] <+AngriestAngryArtist> Astral Chain 2 you get to henshin :P
[3:41:21] <%1matheuw> will it be called griphon legion?
[3:41:23] <%wydamn> YES
[3:41:25] <%starotter70> Nice
[3:41:28] <al0nem0nster> good thing there are no cameras around here to spot the mysterious police hat wearing redhead flying around in the air and knocking out cops by pointing at them as his hair turns blue.

[3:41:39] <SirTeabottom> 2B
[3:41:41] <%dalmek> even ignoring just pure flight
[3:41:43] <+AngriestAngryArtist> And the legion in astral chain 2 can talk smack? :D
[3:41:45] <KoshiLowell> Pat will you get River City Girls?
[3:41:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @1matheuw no it would be chicken legon
[3:41:53] <ravencloak13> Well, more it’s just a tiny ledge.
[3:42:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> B is intense.
[3:42:01] <%starotter70> When'd you get the other one?
[3:42:06] <%Blitz_king01> Kinda paniced
[3:42:06] <Soul_Intern> VERY INTENSE VOICE
[3:42:07] <%starotter70> S-siter
[3:42:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> B is like, panicked.
[3:42:08] <%worldbrand> that was close
[3:42:10] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Sounds like the sister
[3:42:14] <sonicluigi123> huh
[3:42:14] <mujahideenfruityrebels> I like it
[3:42:23] <rubbishbinge> Sounds hot
[3:42:24] <%republicofu> sounds more dire
[3:42:29] <Mendin> Sounds like a tinner unfiltered default
[3:42:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah there are IRIS voices for every character.
[3:42:31] <%starotter70> JIN!?
[3:42:34] <Soul_Intern> OH YEAH MAN
[3:42:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> F is Jin.
[3:42:35] <%worldbrand> bee
[3:42:35] <%kyh9> It's 2B
[3:42:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> B is Akira.
[3:42:38] <%DeathsDoom> 2B
[3:42:39] <Mendin> And that's just Max
[3:42:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> Sounds a bit like lotus
[3:42:43] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> F is Jun, B I thought was 2B
[3:42:46] <+McSnazzyPants> i think every voice actor also did iris lines
[3:42:47] <%wydamn> @starotter70 you may be onto something there
[3:42:47] <mujahideenfruityrebels> I like that one too
[3:42:50] <Monkeyweed21> pat loves his imouto
[3:42:56] <Sphincter_Spelunker> POD!
[3:43:00] <mayorrev> REBB?
[3:43:00] <+zaworldo> SPACE MOM?
[3:43:01] <%pilgrimsayswhat> eh kinda
[3:43:02] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat was just thinking that LUL
[3:43:04] <%1matheuw> a little bit
[3:43:06] <gekizenbu> a greneer squad is on the way
[3:43:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat Every main character has an Iris voice hidden somewhere.
[3:43:09] <%wydamn> Space Mom
[3:43:09] <al0nem0nster> think that's just the distortion robot effect
[3:43:12] <mayorrev> SPACE MOM
[3:43:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its Ordis's space mom puppet
[3:43:25] <al0nem0nster> so there is a Lappy voice.
[3:43:27] <gryffinp> I won't lie, when I saw "Voice B" I was disappointed that it wasn't Bayonetta
[3:43:28] <sonicluigi123> YESDS
[3:43:29] <%Laecerelius> YEYEYE!
[3:43:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Noice.
[3:43:37] <%worldbrand> well shit i should have just snapped everyone's necks huh
[3:43:47] <%starotter70> Same LUL
[3:43:48] <%wydamn> @al0nem0nster I think somebody would get arrested if there wasn't a Lappy voice.
[3:43:49] <doggieo> Distract with CANS
[3:43:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> I think its creepy ordis has a space mom puppet just for us
[3:43:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @gryffinp That would honestly be cooler. Just other Platinum characters.
[3:43:50] <ravencloak13> Oh, Bayo being your guide robot would be sick.
[3:43:56] <%orthodoxwaffle> pat, they're making Deadly Premonition 2
[3:44:05] <%Laecerelius> A Wonder Red voice would be awesome
[3:44:07] <Soul_Intern> Yep
[3:44:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @orthodoxwaffle We watched the direct before playing Astral Chain.
[3:44:19] <mujahideenfruityrebels> There are some tranq rounds by the barrels
[3:44:20] <%orthodoxwaffle> aww
[3:44:20] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @orthodoxwaffle we saw. streamed the direct earlier SeemsGood
[3:44:26] <artificiallynatural> even the music has a metal gear vibe
[3:44:26] <%Keyd00d> pat watched the direct
[3:44:26] <%worldbrand> @doc_ock_rokc i also create a facsimile mother for the children who i am babysitting
[3:44:28] <%orthodoxwaffle> but yay
[3:44:43] <%Cthulos> seems like this is basically meant to be revengeance 2
[3:44:44] <ravencloak13> @doc_ock_rokc He just made one though, he even says. Also he’s a fucking serial killed put into your ship as an AI. The fact he’s not all that weird is actually weirder.
[3:44:45] <Sphincter_Spelunker> but fuck that. Devil May Cry 2 on the Switch
[3:44:47] <+mcjimbo12> i still can't believe they just no-sell announced deadly prem 2 out of nowhere
[3:44:53] <al0nem0nster> does this count as a metal gear sequence?
[3:44:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I like how after you chain up the police your stands get SUPER HYPED.
[3:45:01] <%starotter70> @Sphincter_Spelunker Finally
[3:45:03] <%30000heavies> 30000heavies subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:45:04] <%Laecerelius> Stop being cranky, magic slave
[3:45:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's a nice touch that your stands are like "FUCK YEAH LET'S REBEL!" this whole mission.
[3:45:14] <%dekkitout> Be nice Swordmo, you'll get the bag shakes later~
[3:45:18] <artificiallynatural> Who in their right mind decided releasing DMC2 on its own was a good idea
[3:45:21] <ravencloak13> @too_much_nukie “YOU ARE NOW SLAVES LIKE ME! ARAGRAHHHHRA!”

[3:49:19] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Hack with posing

[3:50:50] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> He saw a ghost.
[3:50:57] <+Jonesman64> this game is sooo freaking GOOOOD
[3:51:01] <%republicofu> anime batman
[3:51:03] <SundarkSoldier> I really hate this chatty drone
[3:51:12] <$SvenHolgersson> Kay-Meera
[3:51:17] <KatabolicRage> like chitin, the most mispronounced word ever
[3:51:18] <jeffishype> also what did i miss
[3:51:19] <+Darren716> Im freaking upset, on the smash sub the Sans announcement has 10k upvotes, the Terry announcement has like 2k, what the fuck
[3:51:19] <ALazo> Key some say Ki
[3:51:20] <+valkuma> did anyone ever say it different?
[3:51:21] <Soul_Intern> PAT USE DOG
[3:51:22] <valriot> Cumera
[3:51:23] <%cereal_box_conspiracy> like chemical
[3:51:24] <+valkuma> its always been Ky-mera
[3:51:24] <jeffishype> why if pat cop wearing rags
[3:51:25] <%worldbrand> cerberus also traditionally has a hard k sound
[3:51:25] <%Jeemukun> greek and latin almost always uses hard C/K
[3:51:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> USE DOG
[3:51:26] <derekwst3> was there a argument about chimera?
[3:51:27] <KoshiLowell> use the Legion
[3:51:28] <Strider222> use your legion
[3:51:29] <%miguelrod777> hes voiced my midoriya in the jon dub and i love him
[3:51:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> Become as Dog
[3:51:32] <Kyphen15> use legion to track
[3:51:33] <AdmiralButtloaf> naw its chimichangamera
[3:51:33] <sonicluigi123> Doggo
[3:51:33] <+McSnazzyPants> do people actually pronounce without a hard k?
[3:51:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> See if the drone caught footage of the attacker pat.
[3:51:42] <%starotter70> @jeffishype Ice cream stuff and Sneaking
[3:51:42] <ravencloak13> @valkuma I hear people say Key mera
[3:51:45] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Kimera? Kaimera sounds better to me
[3:51:47] <%thunderborn32> wait there are idiots who dont know how to say chimera?
[3:51:52] <iaraCatunda> @TheBrazilianHope nice username
[3:51:54] <+Jonesman64> if it was a chimera... what would be around?
[3:52:08] <%mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat IF YOU go into the UI menu, you can remove the repeated tutorial PROMPTS
[3:52:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Follow the line of sight of the drone Pat.
[3:52:12] <KoshiLowell> there we go
[3:52:12] <%worldbrand> there are VAs in this game who also say kee-mera really low-key, presumably because it's closer to the japanese VA pronunciation
[3:52:16] <%Cthulos> there are idiots that can't say terrace Kappa
[3:52:19] <%Keyd00d> ...
[3:52:20] <Sphincter_Spelunker> It's pronounced Chimera. Clearly
[3:52:23] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Genius
[3:52:28] <+netrac> This took me way too long
[3:52:29] <+TheBrazilianHope> @iaraCatunda thanks I made it myself
[3:52:33] <WisdomHat> So how's Paige been since SANS got announced? Smug? Super smug? UNBEARABLY SMUG?
[3:52:35] <ravencloak13> The Japanese also say Kai Mera.
[3:52:44] <juxtest> Boss! Get down! The enemy sniper....
[3:52:45] <%wydamn> @mankeyfigh You are a scholar and a gentleman. I didn't know that either.
[3:52:48] <mujahideenfruityrebels> That’s super duper helpful
[3:52:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Sans isn't in the game.
[3:52:52] <%mankeyfigh> YUP
[3:52:54] <eldragon_1> in Spanish, it's pronounced "kee-mera"
[3:52:56] <tequilazaku> can you float of the broken balcony ont that staircase down there using arm legion?
[3:52:56] <%Keyd00d> Sure you won't need it?
[3:52:57] <ravencloak13> You know, like Ky Kisuke...
[3:52:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @WisdomHat It's just a costume. But she refuses to admit she was wrong.
[3:53:01] <%StripesUltimateEdition> @WisdomHat extremely buttmad
[3:53:02] <pomki20> you still need tutorial later
[3:53:05] <%mankeyfigh> CONTROL GUIDE
[3:53:05] <+Estuko> So maybe someone gimme a quick note on why we in stealth now NotLikeThis
[3:53:05] <ravencloak13> Or Kaiba.
[3:53:19] <ALazo> Smart
[3:53:19] <%starotter70> @ravencloak13 oh you mean "Ky Kisk"
[3:53:25] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @Estuko doing some maverick rogue cop shit
[3:53:26] <%abakkus> framerate dimension time
[3:53:27] <+Jonesman64> O THIS FUCKER
[3:53:27] <AdmiralButtloaf> onion
[3:53:28] <%worldbrand> @ravencloak13 yeah i'm aware that it's a phoneme that they have, but it's clearly not what they say in this game
[3:53:31] <sedrictheschlemp> digimon?
[3:53:34] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Estuko finding dirt in a restricted zone outside the city
[3:53:39] <+Estuko> Ooooh neat
[3:53:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Estuko Pat has become a loose cannon cop that doesn't play by the rules. You're infiltrating an off-limits areas.
[3:53:54] <WisdomHat> So is this whole game like playing V?
[3:54:00] <ravencloak13> No you said the Japanese say it like that but they don’t.
[3:54:16] <+Jonesman64> i love that there are different shieldy bois
[3:54:20] <WanderingSwordsman> fist is great for breaking those shields
[3:54:30] <%worldbrand> I did say the japanese VA pronunciation, and that's how they're pronouncing it on my playthrough
[3:54:53] <%BoboDaHobo> use gladius mode for shield guys
[3:54:54] <%thunderborn32> @Jonesman64 shields are lame and just slow down what should be fast paced combat
[3:54:56] <%starotter70> ORA
[3:55:00] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat does your demon slave prefer being a good boy doggo or is he still pissy about it
[3:55:02] <ravencloak13> Yeah, Kai Mera. They say it like that cause they have those syllables in there language.
[3:55:04] <Soul_Intern> WRYYYYYYYY'
[3:55:07] <+zaworldo> ARM IS SO STRONG
[3:55:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> ITS THOR

[3:55:29] <pillowwasp> Ran into a sans on smash online named Beppis
[3:55:33] <+Jonesman64> @thunderborn32 yes but they keep it from just being mash button = win
[3:55:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @WisdomHat Nah, it plays very differently than DMC V.
[3:55:34] <%dekkitout> Zoooooose!
[3:55:55] <%BoboDaHobo> @doc_ock_rokc understandable, what are you drinking?
[3:56:03] <+zaworldo> BEST MOD IN THE GAME

[3:56:18] <tanarath> Later, Pat.
[3:56:22] <+Jonesman64> and if the shields slow you down that much you need to react faster to them
[3:56:22] <megaminimechamocha> HEY PAT I HEARD ONLINE THAT YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT SANS UNDERTALE
[3:56:23] <%thunderborn32> @Jonesman64 its not a skill to be able to spin a joystick in a circle to stun them
[3:56:34] <mujahideenfruityrebels> @tanarath HeyGuys
[3:56:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @megaminimechamocha Costumes and characters aren't the same thing.
[3:56:45] <%starotter70> @megaminimechamocha apatCrazyhand
[3:56:47] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @MegalomaniacalMegalodon "heya. so if you want YOUR Mii to LOOK like Sans (aka me)" Is Geno in Smash?
[3:56:48] <ravencloak13> Just Macross Missile Spam all these fools
[3:57:10] <%BeastlyP1ays> BeastlyP1ays subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[3:57:12] <+McSnazzyPants> how are shields even a problem just equip gladius
[3:57:21] <megaminimechamocha> @Too_Much_Nukie I refuse this, that sounds like Pat trying desparately to dodge his incorrectness.
[3:57:21] <+McSnazzyPants> or armor
[3:57:30] <%worldbrand> there's no reason to continue this- we both know how it's pronounced. i'm playing the game in japanese, they're clearly not saying kai. but hey, maybe google translate chimera into japanese and see what katakana you get for the loanword that they use
[3:57:35] <Monkeyweed21> has pat learned how to multi stand yet?
[3:57:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @megaminimechamocha Go read the eshop description of the costume.
[3:57:38] <%starotter70> I'm really glad that this Sans/Smash argument has just consumed the entire night
[3:57:51] <%BoboDaHobo> @mcsnazzypants this is the correct answer, gladius solves the problem instantly
[3:57:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @megaminimechamocha but pat won though. Sans isn't a fighter
[3:57:53] <WanderingSwordsman> which would be woolie's goto legion, fist or axe?
[3:58:02] <+zaworldo> @megaminimechamocha he's not wrong tho
[3:58:03] <Zombrocom> Fist 100%
[3:58:05] <tank7013> Fist
[3:58:06] <ravencloak13> Fist, what are you even talking about?
[3:58:10] <%starotter70> @doc_ock_rokc tbf, pat didn't win, Paige just lost
[3:58:15] <ravencloak13> Why would he want axe?
[3:58:21] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Earth
[3:58:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Woolie loves the hyakuretsu ken.
[3:58:30] <WanderingSwordsman> for the heavy hits
[3:58:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's Pat's thing.
[3:58:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat and Paige will love the axe.
[3:58:58] <ravencloak13> Woolie likes speed.
[3:58:59] <FunkyStreams> !uptime
[3:58:59] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 59m.
[3:59:01] <%Cthulos> that's Kyle McCarley
[3:59:02] <%thunderborn32> @megaminimechamocha its not like its not documented the bet is literally recorded word for word they specified it HAD to be a selectable playable character
[3:59:07] <ravencloak13> Also a jetpack.
[3:59:07] <%Cthulos> it's 9S
[3:59:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This is progress.

[3:59:27] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I sees it
[3:59:29] <%1matheuw> oh yeah the arm legion is a literal jetpack
[3:59:30] <%starotter70> wha? sipsipSipsipblind
[3:59:32] <megaminimechamocha> I will NEVER research, Researching is for COWARDS who don't KNOW they are correct.

[4:00:57] <Monkeyweed21> PICTRUE
[4:00:57] <%worldbrand> i like that you can snap pictures of them while they're knocked out and it counts
[4:01:10] <Kyphen15> When you wear the arm legion, what do people see?
[4:01:16] <Sphincter_Spelunker> So is this a Team Skull? With Dirty Blonde lady secretly sponsoring them
[4:01:19] <%Laecerelius> I guess they just see you floating
[4:01:20] <%thunderborn32> @megaminimechamocha this isn't a classroom ill devolve into using only emojis and misspelled words if i feel like it
[4:01:21] <ravencloak13> You being a God.

[4:01:40] <%mankeyfigh> BBBBBBBB
[4:01:41] <megaminimechamocha> This seems like some real overkill on the part of a police officer.
[4:01:41] <ALazo> It actually comes up in a mission later
[4:01:41] <Mendin> Weak-Willed Officier
[4:01:43] <KoshiLowell> Doesn't your hat say POLICE on it

[4:02:18] <%GarbageNirvana> He's Polish and he really likes ice
[4:02:19] <megaminimechamocha> As a rule you should generally expect police officers to not break out their invisible EVA Stands when dealing with ordinary armed assailants.
[4:02:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Too bad you can't wear a hat that says BOOTY INSPECTOR
[4:02:24] <WanderingSwordsman> he's just support his neighborhood popo
[4:02:25] <%wydamn> "I killed the cop it belonged to, which makes my saving you even more remarkable. You're welcome."
[4:02:34] <%ElenaManetta> Maybe it's the kind of police hat where only other cops can see it says "police" on it
[4:02:40] <WanderingSwordsman> *he just

[4:02:54] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Just because you wear a police COSTUME does not mean you are police lol
[4:03:05] <%Dr_Mooose> ^

[4:15:07] <%Divryne> Yes keep going.
[4:15:08] <%wydamn> @AngriestPat You should go into Options and switch your minimap to "Fixed" mode so people can tell you North East West South instead of Right and Left.
[4:15:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> away from the gate
[4:15:09] <%Black_Machete> left
[4:15:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Then jump across.

[4:15:58] <purple_bagel> God this case takes forever but its SO GOOD
[4:16:03] <+SolverCODO> Wind's howling
[4:16:07] <megaminimechamocha> Is there any dumb reason why Legions can't just pull you up in standard situations?
[4:16:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @starotter70 The ladder near the gate and then move away from the gate
[4:16:10] <gekizenbu> we just stole a guy's pants
[4:16:11] <%wydamn> A STORM'S A BREWIN'
[4:16:16] <Mendin> greasy bait?

[4:16:28] <%starotter70> @doc_ock_rokc ah, gotcha
[4:16:29] <+NitronStreams> BABA is PAT
[4:16:33] <+zaworldo> so pat won and lost right?
[4:16:33] <Sphincter_Spelunker> SourPls
[4:16:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It hasn't even started with the combat section.
[4:16:36] <+rynfz> enjoy your pee! hope it comes out okay!
[4:16:36] <%Shadicara> Going to assasinate the toilet
[4:16:41] <%Black_Machete> you are not half way done
[4:16:43] <megaminimechamocha> PAT Is SHIT
[4:16:45] <hassanico1> "2 seconds"
[4:16:48] <+netrac> 1/3rd done
[4:16:49] <%LiquidShake83> lies
[4:16:51] <hassanico1> 2 seconds AKA 5 minutes
[4:16:55] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @Estuko We usually don't get a lot of close quarters in Lost Planet but when we do, the shotgun and the rapid fire machine gun felt greaat
[4:16:56] <+Darren716> Yeah he hasnt even started it yet lol
[4:16:57] <Sphincter_Spelunker> That Sans debate really took it out of him
[4:17:06] <%Keyd00d> not sure if he'll finish this file tonight
[4:17:11] <%Ge3b0t> why is sans debate so important?
[4:17:12] <%starotter70> How long did it take you guys to beat it? Cause I was around 5 hrs
[4:17:15] <hassanico1> Sans stans are the most toxic people on the planet truly
[4:17:17] <purple_bagel> This, the final case, and the second one are the best cases real talk
[4:17:17] <%dukenux> Pat is gonna plan next move in the Sans debate 5d chess
[4:17:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> I used to be god at lost planet...for like no reason
[4:17:25] <cureneckbeard> he's away writing his apology letter
[4:17:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> its just one of those games you sync with
[4:17:37] <megaminimechamocha> I mean when you're as wrong as Pat is, fighting that will take a lot out of you
[4:17:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> but i hated lost planet
[4:17:42] <mujahideenfruityrebels> @starotter70 20ish hours
[4:17:44] <hassanico1> Pat was right though
[4:17:50] <%SilvaChariot0133> We still in slums? Just getting here.
[4:17:54] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @doc_ock_rokc 1 or 2? Couldn't click with 1, but had some great couch coop with 2
[4:17:56] <$SvenHolgersson> Pat's gotta go write that apology letter to Paige
[4:17:57] <%pilgrimsayswhat> No Doomguy no win
[4:18:07] <Sphincter_Spelunker> we don't talk about 3
[4:18:09] <hassanico1> Pat didn't lose but he didn't win
[4:18:10] <cureneckbeard> "When you're short like me, every bump in the road is a hill you can die on." - Pat
[4:18:13] <$SvenHolgersson> If Doomguy doesn't get any rep Paige wins 100%
[4:18:18] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @hassanico1 ^^^^^
[4:18:30] <TheLaw3D4> What was the bet?
[4:18:32] <%mullsey> mullsey subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[4:18:34] <seycheles> literary pat
[4:18:47] <cureneckbeard> that Sans would appear in Smash before Doomguy
[4:18:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @TheLaw3D4 Sans would be playable before Doom Guy.
[4:18:49] <%starotter70> @TheLaw3D4 If Doomguy gets into smash Pat wins, if Sans gets in Paige wins
[4:18:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Not appear.
[4:18:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Playable.
[4:18:54] <cureneckbeard> but then they clarified that it has to be as a playable character
[4:19:04] <cureneckbeard> not an assist trophy
[4:19:07] <%starotter70> @Too_Much_Nukie ^
[4:19:09] <cureneckbeard> but it's an OUTFIT
[4:19:20] <megaminimechamocha> @starotter70 So what happens if a Doomguy Mii Fighter costume gets into Smash?
[4:19:23] <TheLaw3D4> He said they would be playable and who said they wouldn't?
[4:19:25] <%Keyd00d> Sans is not in Smash, his skin is
[4:19:27] <TheLaw3D4> *who?
[4:19:31] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Geno is in Smash sipsipDab
[4:19:32] <%starotter70> @megaminimechamocha Pat ALSO does not win
[4:19:37] <+zayahb> That still Sans
[4:19:39] <cureneckbeard> Paige says skeletons can't have skins
[4:19:40] <megaminimechamocha> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[4:19:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @TheLaw3D4 Paige said Sans would be playable before Doom Guy. Pat said the opposite.
[4:19:50] <TheLaw3D4> Paige wins
[4:19:52] <%starotter70> Mii is it's own character
[4:19:59] <%starotter70> Unless Geno is in smash too
[4:20:02] <TheLaw3D4> He is
[4:20:06] <megaminimechamocha> He is
[4:20:12] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Woolie and Pat win, they realize friendship is more important
[4:20:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's not Sans. There's no unique moveset and the announcer calls it Mii Gunner.
[4:20:20] <%Keyd00d> Only his skin puppet is
[4:20:25] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And the description even says "Look like Sans"
[4:20:32] <KoshiLowell> But it'll be funny so I say Paige wins
[4:20:32] <Sphincter_Spelunker> heya. so if you want YOUR Mii to LOOK like Sans (aka me)
[4:20:45] <megaminimechamocha> @KoshiLowell Finally someone's speaking MY language
[4:20:59] <TheLaw3D4> Sand is playable, just like Daisy is
[4:21:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You guys had more people on your side before the eshop post.
[4:21:04] <TheLaw3D4> if you can move him he's playable
[4:21:04] <KoshiLowell> hell yeah
[4:21:06] <VJdarkworld> sans is an echo fighter of ness
[4:21:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Sans isn't even an echo fighter.
[4:21:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He's a costume.
[4:21:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Daisy is more playable than Sans.
[4:21:26] <tank7013> The description is Sans himself calling it a costume for the Mii so it's officially not Sans
[4:21:26] <%ElenaManetta> AH
[4:21:29] <%ElenaManetta> so sudden
[4:21:30] <vexion_smh> LUL
[4:21:30] <%ElenaManetta> NO
[4:21:32] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Don't mistake playable with "playable character" which Paige said
[4:21:33] <%worldbrand> LUL

[4:22:26] <TheSphereHunter> Hey was up
[4:22:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat Pat it hasn't even started yet.
[4:22:33] <+parrotman01> I heard this game wasn't very long anyway
[4:22:35] <Soul_Intern> WHAT A PUSSY
[4:22:39] <+parrotman01> Oh hey, it's sphere hunter
[4:22:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You're just in the area where you'll figure out what the mission is actually going to be.
[4:22:48] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Black and white? I like that dynamic for the two gatekeepers
[4:22:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @parrotman01 It's very long for a Platinum game.
[4:22:51] <%starotter70> @parrotman01 It's long for a platinum game
[4:22:52] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It's called "vodka".
[4:22:56] <gekizenbu> its at least 20 hours, which is still pretty long

[4:23:34] <+parrotman01> @Too_Much_Nukie @starotter70 That's much better than what I heard. Maybe that "easy mode review" lied about more than just the "no rating system" :D
[4:23:40] <megaminimechamocha> I want to believe I'm a fan of Pat and Paige's stream content, but really I'm just here for that sweet sweet Elmo Content
[4:23:49] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Why does he scream? We keep shaking the bag to find out
[4:23:50] <%starotter70> @parrotman01 Maybe Kappa
[4:23:55] <Soul_Intern> Elmoooooo
[4:23:56] <megaminimechamocha> YEAH
[4:23:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @parrotman01 Reviewers for this game played it on the wrong gamemode where the game literally just plays itself.

[4:24:34] <Sphincter_Spelunker> he'll be back. the slut
[4:24:35] <megaminimechamocha> Whenever Elmo is not on stream, Pat should be saying "Where is Elmo?"
[4:24:40] <kite1haseo> Elmo got away
[4:24:43] <%wydamn> Elmo has REJECTED the stream
[4:24:46] <%eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Has pat heard about deadly premonition 2 yet?
[4:24:51] <cureneckbeard> Elmo's mad at you for dunking so hard on his mom
[4:24:55] <%wydamn> @eldritchhorrortwitchchat yes
[4:25:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> I'm surprised people still trust reviewers these days. its clear they have biases
[4:25:02] <%starotter70> @eldritchhorrortwitchchat Ye, streamed the direct earlier
[4:25:03] <%mrvidicus> The day Elmo jumped off that couch, he jumped out of my life...
[4:25:04] <+Tugs_Keng> Elmo wants better pay for appearances
[4:25:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nintendo Direct was watched live before this.
[4:25:04] <megaminimechamocha> Elmo agreed that Paige was right.
[4:25:07] <%dekkitout> Elmo has chosen to cut all ties in his quest for power
[4:25:08] <%ElenaManetta> You have to NOT pay attention to him
[4:25:10] <%Faustgesicht> So has the Sans thing come to a head yet?
[4:25:16] <%eldritchhorrortwitchchat> K
[4:25:25] <%Bt_Robot> Don't forget dirty laundry quest hobo!
[4:25:33] <megaminimechamocha> I dunno chat. has the Sans thing come to a head yet? Kappa
[4:25:35] <%dekkitout> The Sans head crowned so hard hours ago
[4:25:41] <%starotter70> Ambiguous Japanese Drug
[4:25:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> baby wants attention
[4:25:56] <%BoboDaHobo> @faustgesicht yes, it had been determined that hoes certainly are mad
[4:26:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The Sans thing came to a head, some people in chat won't let it go because they arrived late.
[4:26:12] <Soul_Intern> POWERRRRRRRRR
[4:26:17] <Soul_Intern> NEED MORE
[4:26:19] <%dekkitout> Moar powerrrr!

[4:26:54] <%Faustgesicht> So who won? Pat, Paige, or some wierd amalgam?
[4:26:55] <%dekkitout> A Hermit Rewards Card?
[4:26:58] <gekizenbu> dark vending machine
[4:27:03] <%wydamn> @megaminimechamocha @Faustgesicht it could have more of a head, but we'll find out if donning the Sans costume automatically sets your Mii Gunner's name to Sans.
[4:27:05] <%Keyd00d> DRUG VENDOR
[4:27:05] <%jobbedbone> it counts pat.
[4:27:07] <%starotter70> @Faustgesicht yes
[4:27:09] <vexion_smh> d00d
[4:27:10] <+Estuko> xwx
[4:27:10] <DSD24> Vendor 0 is the best
[4:27:10] <+Grayhammatter> HOLY SHIT
[4:27:12] <%Bt_Robot> Always thought Virgil drank Virgil Cola from the Darksiders universe
[4:27:14] <%Faustgesicht> great
[4:27:14] <%starotter70> Do it coward
[4:27:15] <%NeroInfinite> THATS A LOW PRICE?
[4:27:16] <hassanico1> Sans Undervendor
[4:27:21] <Sphincter_Spelunker> only 1k ameribucks
[4:27:21] <%MoraMiarty> bring more macca next time!
[4:27:22] <+parrotman01> Did Peach show up on the stream yet? How red faced mad was she?
[4:27:26] <DSD24> "Make sure you bring more macca next time!"
[4:27:28] <+Estuko> IS THAT THE TSUNDERE-VENDOR LOL
[4:27:33] <%wydamn> Sans (Gunndertale)
[4:27:33] <%SilvaChariot0133> yup
[4:27:33] <%BoboDaHobo> @faustgesicht no one won, just a lot of yelling and hard opinions about definitions
[4:27:34] <+Grayhammatter> damn, tsundere vendor
[4:27:35] <DSD24> @MoraMiarty Dang it you got it first
[4:27:40] <ShichiNoBushi> Tsundere Ven-3
[4:27:44] <+Grayhammatter> IRIS!
[4:27:44] <%starotter70> @parrotman01 Via phone
[4:27:45] <hassanico1> @parrotman01 did you miss the 40 minutes phonea rgment?
[4:27:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> It's not like I WANT to sell you stuff or anything
[4:27:53] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Doesn't that vendor sound a bit like Jackass from Automata?
[4:27:56] <%jobbedbone> we will never hear the end of this
[4:28:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> Cats like food yeah yeah yeah
[4:28:03] <%dekkitout> Ah damn, they fiending...
[4:28:06] <+parrotman01> I didn't miss the phone argument. I was hoping for her to show up IN PERSON for fight ROUND 2
[4:28:14] <megaminimechamocha> Now, technically speaking, even if Sans Undertale was specifically put in Smash as a character, so long as no one mentions the Undertale game anywhere, Pat could claim it's Sans Deltarune instead and weasel out of consequences that way Kappa
[4:28:20] <%Faustgesicht> I won't have it any other way
[4:28:22] <ShichiNoBushi> If you read the bio on Vender-3 (Rude), it'll pretty much hint at a tsundere personality.
[4:28:35] <%starotter70> @parrotman01 I can see Paige flying down from Japan just to try and gloat

[4:44:54] <%RubberFistFight> @Sphincter_Spelunker that actually sounds broadly similar to Welsh rice pudding as well - my mum used to make it when i was a kid. Since we're originally from Wales.

[4:47:34] <%asmistake> the one thing that has amazed me about this game is that the policewomen's shorts in this game actually model the fabric wrinkling on their butts when they walk
[4:47:41] <+McSnazzyPants> @thunderborn32 rice pudding != rice porridge
[4:47:43] <%reonome> @thunderborn32 you want to look for porridge, not pudding
[4:47:44] <poweruser> scholar gang, gonna teach you a lesson
[4:47:55] <megaminimechamocha> @asmistake Don't forget the real butt flexing
[4:47:57] <InvaderKAZ> I find it hard to get good ranks on short fights because there's no time to use all the mechanics for points
[4:47:59] <%RubberFistFight> @thunderborn32 because different countries have different ways of preparing the dish, with different ingredients resulting in a different flavour? Crazy concept, I know.
[4:48:12] <%thunderborn32> okay thats different when i read porridge i think or rice gruel
[4:48:26] <cerass> With your police only weapon... Nothing suspect
[4:48:28] <%asmistake> @megaminimechamocha this game is such a technological marvel
[4:48:32] <%Cthulos> @rubberfistfight ew

[4:48:55] <%Cthulos> their chicken tendies would taste DIFFERENT?
[4:48:56] <Sphincter_Spelunker> ya dig?
[4:48:57] <%worldbrand> i found some refights on early chapters to be hard to S+ with an upgraded x-baton
[4:49:05] <%asmistake> i like the small whackamastick
[4:49:08] <InvaderKAZ> Gladius is my favorite

[4:49:28] <%abakkus> someday you'll learn how to jump, when you're old enough
[4:49:33] <%asmistake> @worldbrand just gotta use a lot of legions and a lot of legion skills
[4:49:34] <%RubberFistFight> @Cthulos right? How DARE they not make them in a generally american style.
[4:49:45] <%worldbrand> i will keep that in mind, thanks
[4:49:46] <%asmistake> and not get hit? i think that's something
[4:49:48] <%Shadicara> I love they just give you a dog
[4:49:49] <%thunderborn32> @RubberFistFight literally european, latin, Vietnamese, AND japanese rice pudding all have the same ingredient lists with the exception of toppings

[4:50:14] <%RubberFistFight> @thunderborn32 DOUBT [X]

[4:50:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> Does Astral Blade wold shake?
[4:50:22] <InvaderKAZ> Wait shouldn't you have 3 cans
[4:50:28] <%asmistake> i don't like that you can't ride any of the other legions
[4:50:35] <%worldbrand> he already found one of the kids
[4:50:40] <InvaderKAZ> Ah okay
[4:50:41] <%MakotoPB> @thunderborn32 are you still talking about pudding instead of gruel or did you move on to a different culinary discussion
[4:50:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I ate dinner and Pat is still in the junk district LUL
[4:50:47] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @asmistake You can wear the arms like armor and float
[4:50:51] <+NitronStreams> do you get a bombers notebook now
[4:50:59] <%worldbrand> or possibly only picked up two cans
[4:51:03] <%asmistake> a regular citizen just watches a super attractive policeman floating around like an esper
[4:51:14] <%thunderborn32> @MakotoPB we moved on to porridge and gruel but someone brought the pudding back up
[4:51:19] <%RubberFistFight> @MakotoPB nah he's insisting that every country makes rice pudding identically, even though I know for a fact that ain't true since I've eaten a few different varieties and come from a country where it's actually a super popular dish.
[4:51:25] <+Edrem> Hey pat did you hear about nakamura leaving ghostwire protocol?

[4:52:59] <ne0bunny> I shot that thing out of the air with arrow legion and the guy was sad
[4:52:59] <%RubberFistFight> @reonome rice pudding is a specific dish though, distinct from just plain pudding (which in my mind is that gelatinous stuff with an even consistency, usually flavoured vanilla or chocolate, kinda like custard)

[4:54:57] <%asmistake> has anyone actually slid down a ladder like that in real life?
[4:54:58] <jcflyguy> Grits are superior.
[4:55:00] <%RubberFistFight> @reonome ohhhh now I getcha. Even so, the dessert dish is made differently in different countries. Some places add nutmeg, some add cinnamon, some add vanilla, or sugar, some add none of that and just rely on the sweetness of the milk, some add cream, etc etc.
[4:55:02] <%dukenux> NotLikeThis
[4:55:03] <%dekkitout> You've clearly had some bad grits
[4:55:06] <%asmistake> i think i'd break both ankles if i tried

[4:55:18] <%wydamn> @asmistake lyes but I grew up on a farm
[4:55:31] <%RubberFistFight> @reonome my overall point being that his claim of "everyone makes it the same" is blatantly fucking false.
[4:55:32] <megaminimechamocha> What does chat think about tapioca pudding though?
[4:55:39] <%asmistake> is it as fun as it looks @wydamn ?

[4:56:28] <%miguelrod777> of course its fake its a counterfeit
[4:56:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> Never had taopica. It's probably yucky
[4:56:29] <%reonome> @RubberFistFight I mean, if he was talking about rice pudding recipes don't differ that much, its still mainly milk and rice and sugar
[4:56:36] <%RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound exactly :)
[4:56:38] <%wydamn> @asmistake truth

[4:57:07] <%dukenux> I'm gonna buy myself rice pudding
[4:57:19] <ShichiNoBushi> A "suspension" could be a mixture of some sort that doesn't mix well unlike a solution.

[4:57:25] <%reonome> OhMyDog
[4:57:29] <megaminimechamocha> Yeah you fuckers are making me really hungry for rice pudding
[4:57:31] <%RubberFistFight> @reonome sure but there's a whole lot more to it than that. The three primary ingredients don't differ, but the final product does based on other things that happen during the process. Same as apple pie and apple crumble starting out broadly the same and winding up distinct from one another.

[4:59:38] <%thunderborn32> @RubberFistFight thats like arguing all icecream is different completely different just based on the toping that are used in it, its still icecream or in this case its still just sweet rice in a cream with topings
[4:59:39] <Derkinstacker> Big champ.
[4:59:39] <%dukenux> Where's red ice from again?
[4:59:44] <%wydamn> @Scanford You're like the third or fourth person to ask

[5:00:20] <%dukenux> @InugamiTheHound ah riiight
[5:00:20] <%RubberFistFight> @thunderborn32 the thing is there ARE different varieties of icecream, so all you've done is make my point for me.
[5:00:24] <+zaworldo> just kill them all
[5:00:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You could totally just kill them.

[5:00:59] <Saltmeisterr> why is twitch so behind for me?
[5:01:03] <%MakotoPB> @rubberfistfight Penn State Creamery ice cream has fat content so high they are only allowed to sell it on campus

[5:01:20] <%asmistake> "bitch I'm ALWAYS on the lookout for cats"
[5:01:23] <%dukenux> bullshit, Ice Cream are a kind of sauce, obviously
[5:01:25] <%RubberFistFight> @thunderborn32 and I mean, you can oversimplify ANYTHING to prove your point, if you're that interested in being disingenuous. Might as well say that all vegetable dishes are the same because they all start as vegetables.

[5:01:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> Praise be to elmo
[5:01:50] <%worldbrand> @MakotoPB Conversely, Breyer's has fat content so low that they have to label their ice cream as "frozen dairy dessert" in canada
[5:01:51] <+McSnazzyPants> it's frozen lard with strawberries and chocolate blended in
[5:01:55] <+Grayhammatter> S+ PogChamp
[5:02:01] <%thunderborn32> @RubberFistFight and you can try to overcomplicate anything to try to prove your point throwing about half baked logic doesn't make you right
[5:02:03] <Derkinstacker> Pure platinum.
[5:02:03] <%MakotoPB> @garbagequeenellie pretty sure they start hot to help mix it in before they cool it back down
[5:02:14] <+temporal_zenith> Yep, Elmo is pretty adorable
[5:02:16] <%Black_Machete> h
[5:02:21] <%RubberFistFight> @worldbrand that's not even getting into things like gelato and sorbet, or frozen yoghurt, or frozen custard...
[5:02:29] <%Black_Machete> he will give you the same info
[5:02:31] <%MakotoPB> @worldbrand cool factoid
[5:02:41] <DSD24> I am glad I got a 9S bot to speak for me
[5:02:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> PULL OVER, that ice cream's TOO FAT
[5:02:44] <%worldbrand> I keep going to gelato places and ordering sorbet
[5:02:52] <%worldbrand> I'm probably missing out, but i really like sorbet
[5:02:56] <WanderingSwordsman> shh got to get 100%
[5:03:02] <%wydamn> "It's hard being a monitor seller that doesn't sell his monitors..."
[5:03:05] <%starotter70> @RubberFistFight Do Dipping Dots count
[5:03:14] <%RubberFistFight> @thunderborn32 lol "half baked logic" like "all rice pudding is the same because it's got rice in it"
[5:03:16] <megaminimechamocha> I think this dimensional disease plot was just introduced into this game so no one had to worry about animating mouth flaps in game.
[5:03:19] <%dukenux> i dont think i ever had like an authentic italian gelato
[5:03:20] <%dekkitout> Dipping dots totally count!
[5:03:23] <%dukenux> but sorbet is nice
[5:03:23] <megaminimechamocha> mjbPower
[5:03:23] <%ElenaManetta> This guy is voicing this character like he's Patton Oswalt
[5:03:29] <%Nobrev> gelato > ice cream
[5:03:30] <megaminimechamocha> mjbJake
[5:03:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> Dipping dots is okay
[5:03:32] <megaminimechamocha> mjbJAKE
[5:03:37] <%MakotoPB> anyone ever try those dragon breath stuff?
[5:03:39] <ospreyworks> why's he not a cop anymore?
[5:03:40] <%RubberFistFight> @starotter70 I don't know what they are, not sure if we have them here in australia, or if they're called something different.
[5:03:50] <T3merity> Mugatu!
[5:03:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ospreyworks we are under cover....with a police hat
[5:03:57] <ospreyworks> ah
[5:04:10] <%dukenux> We are fucking under cover!
[5:04:10] <%wydamn> @AngriestPat If you find the kids, they will tell you where the secret passage is, and it's easier than this mission
[5:04:11] <%worldbrand> i've seen off-brand dippin' dots... minimelts, i think?
[5:04:14] <%asmistake> it's the perfect cover
[5:04:21] <%starotter70> @RubberFistFight It's like a bowl of pellet sized ice cream
[5:04:21] <%asmistake> noone will suspect a thing
[5:04:31] <%InugamiTheHound> @doc_ock_rokc I love dipping dots. sean spicer hates dipping dots
[5:04:33] <%asmistake> oh we talking about dippin' dots now?
[5:04:36] <+SolverCODO> playing to completion
[5:04:43] <%dukenux> The Yoshikage Popo
[5:04:43] <%asmistake> the ice cream of the future?
[5:04:45] <%worldbrand> dippin' dots is clearly a salad
[5:04:47] <%ElenaManetta> no way you're gonna stream completion for this game
[5:04:49] <megaminimechamocha> Could Astral Chain Boy kill Diavolo?
[5:04:49] <%starotter70> Then what about the pictures Kappa
[5:04:50] <ShichiNoBushi> The Bombers from Majora's Mask?
[5:04:54] <%dukenux> "TALK"
[5:04:56] <%dekkitout> What is that guy's beef with Dipppin Dots anyways
[5:04:59] <%ElenaManetta> its TOO BIG
[5:05:00] <%Dr_Mooose> kick his ass
[5:05:06] <%hussdogrob> if you're going for completion you already missed a whole fight file
[5:05:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @InugamiTheHound I like it too but its just icecream but frozen into little balls
[5:05:24] <%RubberFistFight> @asmistake mostly just to debunk @thunderborn32 's assertion that dishes that start with similar ingredients are ALWAYS THE SAME, regardless of where they're made, who made them, the method of preparation, or additional ingredients.
[5:05:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Use your stand against these unarmed civillians!
[5:05:24] <SulfurousAcid> I just got here, why's pat look like a hobo
[5:05:32] <+McSnazzyPants> undercover
[5:05:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @SulfurousAcid He's undercover.
[5:05:35] <%wydamn> It's okay, they're TRESPASSERS, they don't have UNION permission to be here
[5:05:35] <InvaderKAZ> @SulfurousAcid It's a disguise
[5:05:38] <%InugamiTheHound> @doc_ock_rokc yeah they are great if they not too hard. I want some dipping dots now
[5:05:43] <+JacktheMan18> I keep forgetting your stands can still hit people
[5:05:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And in a sector that he's forbidden to be in.
[5:05:48] <KoshiLowell> even though you've got a hat that says
[5:05:49] <$rdark_ksu> big sneak
[5:05:49] <KoshiLowell> POLICE
[5:05:54] <%starotter70> I think they were talking about the guy in the bottom left
[5:05:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Notice his hat that says POLICE
[5:05:57] <%InugamiTheHound> no, he was talking about you in real life!
[5:05:57] <%ElenaManetta> HAHAHAH i thought that guy meant "pat" not the character
[5:05:59] <Saltmeisterr> DESTROYED
[5:06:01] <$rdark_ksu> do....do they not question the baton?
[5:06:02] <%asmistake> Ah, i see
[5:06:03] <%dukenux> Hes a hobo man, in this hobo plan
[5:06:03] <valriot> Hobos Mad
[5:06:08] <%worldbrand> his character also hasnt put the baton away
[5:06:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> "I found it"
[5:06:13] <Soul_Intern> POLICE HOBO
[5:06:19] <haisho> kind of strange how you're sneaking in while wielding a police issue X-Baton
[5:06:20] <%asmistake> and like the only thing congee and rice pudding have in common is literally the rice
[5:06:21] <InvaderKAZ> Even besides the hat, the Legatus on your back and arm is a dead giveaway
[5:06:24] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat just tell them it's a pretend police hat from the pretend police hat store, it's fine Kappa
[5:06:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> Hey it's the guy from Judgment
[5:06:27] <RupanSen> lewd
[5:06:30] <%wydamn> @valriot HOBOES ARE INDEED MAD
[5:06:32] <Sphincter_Spelunker> [ POLICE ] hat
[5:06:33] <%RubberFistFight> Baton out on stream?
[5:06:35] <%MakotoPB> he only has a baton and soem crazy chain thing hanging from his arm
[5:06:36] <%SilvaChariot0133> not yet
[5:06:37] <ShichiNoBushi> Your shapeshifting X-Baton.
[5:06:41] <+temporal_zenith> "No cop would be stupid enough to wear that hat undercover so you must be legit!"
[5:06:42] <daisyyyy> I found out about the vents without talking to that guy so i missed that quesy
[5:06:44] <%PrincessLuna85> PrincessLuna85 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[5:06:45] <megaminimechamocha> Also that special hardware hanging from your hand that only special members of the police force would ever have.
[5:06:48] <daisyyyy> quest even
[5:06:48] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat PAT YOUR BATON IS SHOWING
[5:06:49] <%hussdogrob> hey chat did Pat ever finish that broken drone quest earlier this file?
[5:06:50] <%dukenux> Just tell them you beat a cop and took it from him. You gain +++ Respect
[5:06:50] <WanderingSwordsman> nah the gladius is more subtle
[5:06:50] <KoshiLowell> We're about to meet the best character
[5:06:57] <%asmistake> and your ghost holding book on your shoulder
[5:06:58] <+McSnazzyPants> and now for my favorite character
[5:06:59] <%InugamiTheHound> he's got a baton, wrist stand and police hat
[5:07:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> so what is the legion stand names
[5:07:01] <%ElenaManetta> Cats are liquid
[5:07:03] <%SilvaChariot0133> Ask Elmo
[5:07:05] <Soul_Intern> The just do
[5:07:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Cats are liquid
[5:07:07] <megaminimechamocha> If they fits...
[5:07:08] <%starotter70> the same way they fit in a jar
[5:07:09] <%Dr_Mooose> shut up, that's how
[5:07:21] <Soul_Intern> If their heads fit, their whole body fits
[5:07:22] <%Scrub_Seeker> @doc_ock_rokc Sword, Arrow, Arm, and Beast
[5:07:22] <%asmistake> we've got Vaporwave, Poocho
[5:07:24] <ShichiNoBushi> As long as they can get their head through, cats can get into anywhere.
[5:07:25] <valriot> if it fit, they sit
[5:07:28] <%AnIrishPapaya> they're just basically pillar men
[5:07:28] <%Bt_Robot> everybody knows cats have no bones
[5:07:29] <WanderingSwordsman> best boy in coming
[5:07:32] <%dukenux> common misconception
[5:07:32] <%InugamiTheHound> solid cat, liquid cat and solidus cat
[5:07:36] <%dukenux> Cats are plasma
[5:07:36] <%asmistake> Bicep Boy, Sharpy, and one we don't have yet
[5:07:42] <Sphincter_Spelunker> It's like when you're a kid and get your head stuck in the bannister, except cats don't
[5:07:45] <%worldbrand> cats can pass through anything when not directly observed
[5:07:46] <haisho> you'd be surprised how many things cats can sneak into. Problem is they usually can't sneak OUT.
[5:07:51] <%PontiusPyrite> form of mist
[5:07:53] <%BoboDaHobo> I feel like this game has a little too much filler if I'm being honest, still a great game though

[5:07:58] <%Bt_Robot> But they are also made of glass

[5:24:34] <%Laecerelius> Pat, follow him

[5:25:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @KatabolicRage Pat found one.
[5:25:29] <%worldbrand> i had only found one before this
[5:25:29] <KatabolicRage> oh did he?
[5:25:29] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I think Pat said he found one before
[5:25:31] <KoshiLowell> Man I wanna hang with THIS crew
[5:25:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I thought this was the only one in the game.
[5:25:31] <%thunderborn32> welcome to the cool kids club were we think were edge lord because we make our rice pudding spicy
[5:25:36] <KatabolicRage> the ark is a megacity dude
[5:25:44] <Hydrapissed> karate hermit
[5:25:50] <%Segartner> More like Megacountry
[5:25:51] <gekizenbu> Blue Evolve is parallel universe Red Bull, obviously
[5:25:52] <42nfl19> if Kyle does not join up in the final battle I WILL BE DISAPPOINTED
[5:25:53] <al0nem0nster> they say it's an island but odds are they repurpased australia.
[5:25:54] <megaminimechamocha> MEGACITY ONE
[5:26:00] <Daxalog> Whats Blue Evolve?
[5:26:05] <%dukenux> Does that mean there's a Judge Dredd?
[5:26:11] <KoshiLowell> take a selfie with Kyle
[5:26:12] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Guzma and his Team Skull
[5:26:14] <%worldbrand> @al0nem0nster it's a Hypermegafloat
[5:26:18] <SulfurousAcid> Blue Evolve makes you glow red
[5:26:19] <%Nobrev> is blue evole like chimera crack or something
[5:26:21] <+CharredChord> There's a couple of Hermit hideouts in earlier chapters. They are hidden behind holo-walls. I know there's one in 3 and .
[5:26:23] <starlitalpha> drugs
[5:26:25] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Have they explained how they do agriculture?
[5:26:26] <+CharredChord> and 4
[5:26:26] <%Dr_Mooose> a throne fit for a king. a couch
[5:26:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah seriously take a selfie with your friend Kyle.
[5:26:35] <%BoboDaHobo> it's crazy that for such a megacity, there is basically no verticality to it, so much wasted space
[5:26:40] <%dukenux> GIMMEDRUGSMAN
[5:26:44] <KoshiLowell> Imagine you on Blue Evolve + Legion
[5:26:46] <KoshiLowell> ultimate power
[5:26:52] <DSD24> Blue Magic
[5:26:52] <%mankeyfigh> Hope Pat doesn’t see this, but I’m hard calling Hal was the old leader
[5:27:05] <%dukenux> my Baby Blue~
[5:27:10] <+McSnazzyPants> @bobodahobo if you look down over the edge in some areas you cannot see the bottom, and plenty of other buildings in the distance
[5:27:12] <gekizenbu> bobo they’re on the roof of multi story buildings here cause the floor is f’ed
[5:27:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Of course Pat is gonna see it you idiot.
[5:27:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Too much verticality might capsize the Ark, idk
[5:27:18] <Admiral_PopnFresh> That means, they can see your stand, huh
[5:27:20] <gryffinp> This game is really bad about interface spoilers.
[5:27:24] <SulfurousAcid> Kyle and Douglas
[5:27:25] <starlitalpha> hal was not the old leader
[5:27:27] <%thunderborn32> @AngriestPat so is he your jetstream sam?
[5:27:27] <+McSnazzyPants> remember, this entire area is only intended at the very top
[5:27:31] <megaminimechamocha> mjbYell
[5:27:37] <+McSnazzyPants> *inhabited at
[5:27:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He wasn't the old leader, but if you're worried about spoiling something in chat just don't post it.
[5:27:51] <starlitalpha> ^ that
[5:27:55] <%mankeyfigh> @too_much_nukie Dammit your right
[5:27:57] <Rosy_Joan> I bet its because Blue Evolve is made with baby tears.
[5:27:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> We did see him before!
[5:28:00] <%PanicSwytch> Tell me about, Molly, Sandra, Meth, Cocaine, Angel Dust
[5:28:05] <KoshiLowell> It's time for Puppy
[5:28:07] <%dekkitout> Would the blue magic even do anything for the protag
[5:28:10] <jcflyguy> Selfie with Kyle!
[5:28:15] <%dukenux> Heal that guy
[5:28:17] <%Bt_Robot> Just got it! Kyle looks like a character from RUINER.
[5:28:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Drugs are always a good thing.
[5:28:27] <Hydrapissed> Heal that guy
[5:28:34] <+battlebeast67> Hey Pat did you know that there's a parry in this?
[5:28:39] <%worldbrand> oh shit you're right
[5:28:40] <%BoboDaHobo> huh, I guess I just figured there was no verticality because you can almost always see the sky
[5:28:45] <Saltmeisterr> Kyle is just a ruiner boss
[5:28:45] <+Estuko> LOL
[5:28:46] <%worldbrand> holographic anorak is a really good look
[5:28:48] <Datsanegg> Just chillin
[5:28:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> What a dork.

[5:29:29] <megaminimechamocha> I want to watch Woolie stream this game so I can see him lose his mind about Kyle
[5:29:34] <%ElenaManetta> RAWK
[5:29:39] <valriot> PogChamp PogChamp
[5:29:43] <%BoboDaHobo> the music!
[5:29:43] <Derkinstacker> Love this song.
[5:29:50] <%ElenaManetta> yeah now we're rolling it out DMC
[5:29:53] <WanderingSwordsman> Kyle is just japanese woolie
[5:30:12] <%ElenaManetta> Kyle is more Woolie's OC than Woolie himself
[5:30:22] <Derkinstacker> It's what Woolie would become if he was allowed back to japan.
[5:30:25] <snoozeaholic> Punished Woolie
[5:30:26] <al0nem0nster> Wooly is Kyle's OC.
[5:30:27] <megaminimechamocha> Yeah Woolie is cool, but he's not KYLE Cool
[5:30:27] <InvaderKAZ> I can't believe Pat is a higher level than me and I'm like 3 files ahead
[5:30:41] <+Estuko> Wtf was the thing Raiden says when he pulls off a Zandatsu it's killing me I can't remember
[5:30:43] <WanderingSwordsman> h
[5:30:44] <%worldbrand> "so i did some grinding offscreen"
[5:30:47] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat did what he does. "So I grinded off screen."
[5:30:48] <%dekkitout> Who woulda thunk [Bring Me to Life] could retroactively create its own user
[5:30:54] <Derkinstacker> Pat, if you LZ when you shine on taking out a heart, you do a super kill where they shatter.
[5:30:55] <SulfurousAcid> fight doggo with doggo
[5:30:55] <+McSnazzyPants> he did a bunch of grinding, as is tradition
[5:30:55] <WanderingSwordsman> god this ost is soild
[5:31:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He knows about the hidden LZ prompt.
[5:31:12] <TheLaw3D4> Would have been nice to see him actually get challenged
[5:31:22] <Derkinstacker> nvm then.
[5:31:31] <%InugamiTheHound> shadow?
[5:31:46] <Zombrocom> I am shocked we still doint have axe
[5:32:05] <%Cthulos> Man I love Lunar Phase
[5:32:05] <Derkinstacker> Axe is next chapter i believe.
[5:32:06] <TheLaw3D4> But does he know about HOlding the Y button to swap legions better?
[5:32:06] <+CharredChord> did I just hear a goat
[5:32:07] <KoshiLowell> awww that's a shame
[5:32:18] <WanderingSwordsman> lvl really only increase his hp, unless we're talking legions
[5:32:23] <%BoboDaHobo> you gotta wait before you get the best stand
[5:32:23] <%worldbrand> i'm less surprised that we get axe so late and more surprised that we got everything else in a row
[5:32:24] <%Big_Dream> axe is like the best legion
[5:32:35] <Zombrocom> Well, I guess that makes sense considering he has your dad
[5:32:42] <TheLaw3D4> @WanderingSwordsman Yes more health, damage and defense does make things easier.
[5:32:53] <Derkinstacker> Axe is for big huge damage. You can melt huge health enemies in like a single combo.
[5:33:00] <%Black_Machete> I didn't like axe much but I'm trying stuff one him
[5:33:05] <Derkinstacker> since hes the only one to multi combo off the clever.
[5:33:11] <%worldbrand> OH SHIT
[5:33:12] <Zombrocom> Arrow!
[5:33:12] <SulfurousAcid> LUL
[5:33:13] <%HyraFukit> Amazing

[5:34:45] <42nfl19> If I wear your face does that make me you?
[5:34:46] <%BoboDaHobo> @arcaderabbit48 most of the complicit chapter build up but he just started it's combat section
[5:34:47] <42nfl19> no
[5:34:48] <SulfurousAcid> Pat's favorite
[5:34:52] <waxpants> when u gonna play star sector
[5:34:59] <starlitalpha> wearing someones skin doesnt make you that person
[5:35:03] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @42nfl19 "I'll take his Face... Off."
[5:35:05] <InvaderKAZ> Yes it does
[5:35:07] <%arcaderabbit48> @BoboDaHobo Are these guys a resistance group, or what?
[5:35:11] <megaminimechamocha> @42nfl19 You're not going to appreciate my personal politics about face stealing, I think.
[5:35:20] <%Cthulos> @starlitalpha oof
[5:35:25] <MistahMrMatt> is this game actually mad hype..cause this looks mad hype...\
[5:35:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It is.
[5:35:34] <Derkinstacker> It is mad hype.
[5:35:39] <megaminimechamocha> It's pretty ok yeah
[5:35:42] <+McSnazzyPants> @mistahmrmatt is a platinum game, what do you expect
[5:35:42] <%dekkitout> It be dummy hype, yo
[5:35:44] <+CharredChord> You can use the Zandatsu on this lug for big damage and stun
[5:35:50] <MistahMrMatt> good point lmao
[5:35:54] <%asmistake> if you can dodge that well, Pat, you should be dismissing and Perfect Call/Syncing a lot more
[5:35:54] <%ElenaManetta> The more I think about it, Astral Chain is such a cool and unique name
[5:35:59] <%HyraFukit> I bought this game after one stream. The missions are exhausting and amazing to play through. I blame pat.
[5:36:00] <TheLaw3D4> 9.99/10 Very Platinum
[5:36:13] <megaminimechamocha> A lot more downtime than I thought there would be, but it's State-of-the-Art Platinum
[5:36:16] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @AngriestPat the sword one has an invincible counter but it's on a second sync attack after the first so it's a little more vulnerable, it's when you spin him out like a beyblade
[5:36:22] <InvaderKAZ> Excellent work Patrick
[5:36:23] <TheLaw3D4> I beat it twice already
[5:36:30] <anthlon1> theandGG
[5:36:32] <MistahMrMatt> good i need a new game to play on switch havent had much to poay on it lately
[5:36:33] <%ElenaManetta> YEAH

[5:36:42] <%BoboDaHobo> @arcaderabbit48 it's group of people using drugs to fight chimeras, they were left behind when their zone was quarantined and now they fend for themselves

[5:55:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat hates using items though.
[5:55:38] <%kiiiirsten> Anyway Sans Undertale is in smash now so fuck Pat for being apatBig wrong
[5:55:44] <Sphincter_Spelunker> SourPls
[5:55:46] <%BoboDaHobo> this is gonna be a one file stream
[5:55:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @kiiiirsten He's not.
[5:55:50] <%PauliusMaximus> you could have also missed some red matter
[5:55:59] <eiightbiitt> is Pat ever gonna play any more of Control?
[5:56:00] <+CaptainGrime> @kiiiirsten Kappa
[5:56:02] <%kiiiirsten> Sans is in Smash and Paige and I are both big winners and if you don't agree then you're big losers and that's just math!
[5:56:03] <KaliasTV> Fighting in the fight dimension? Nah
[5:56:04] <starlitalpha> pats not gonna make it far in the file 12 cases without using items
[5:56:07] <DSD24> @kiiiirsten A costume is in
[5:56:17] <+CaptainGrime> @kiiiirsten sans costume
[5:56:18] <megaminimechamocha> Pat isn't confirmed 100% wrong till Doomguy isn't in Smash and they end their content with them
[5:56:21] <%Keyd00d> but more tho
[5:56:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I'm confident that you can beat this game with 0 item usage.
[5:56:29] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @kiiiirsten "heya. so if you want YOUR Mii to LOOK like Sans (aka me)" By that logic, P3 and P4 protags are in Smash
[5:56:30] <megaminimechamocha> But for now he's just mostly wrong
[5:56:32] <transporterthesequel> Chat remember, one for us two for US
[5:56:32] <%kiiiirsten> I am so glad Sans undertale is now 100% confirmed for Smash
[5:56:51] <+CaptainGrime> LUL
[5:56:52] <KatabolicRage> it's actually a good idea to use the items you have to hand in at the end, you actually get points for doing it
[5:56:53] <megaminimechamocha> @Sphincter_Spelunker P3 and P4 Protags are in Smash! PogChamp
[5:56:58] <KatabolicRage> helps you get s+ ranks
[5:57:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat The vending machines in the astral plane sell you good items.
[5:57:04] <%Keyd00d> I've only ever used HP healing items
[5:57:06] <eiightbiitt> aw man I missed it I'll catch the Vod
[5:57:12] <starlitalpha> you can almost certainly beat the game without using items, but its clear they expect you to and even reward you for it
[5:57:14] <%mankeyfigh> Go to @angriestpat Twitter FOR ANY AND ALL SCHEDULE CHANGES ladies and gents
[5:57:16] <%BoboDaHobo> batteries are for more revives

[5:57:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat and ICECREAM
[5:57:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah that's totally valid.
[5:57:31] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> You bought icecream.
[5:57:35] <%MegboyManuel> using items means ur a scrub
[5:57:37] <Monkeyweed21> but youre fully upgraded
[5:57:38] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> items are only useful for really the endgame hard shit

[5:57:46] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Scroll down and read? Too much effort
[5:57:52] <%DeathsDoom> it is weird that game gives points for using heals
[5:57:55] <%ElenaManetta> NO. I like it when pat yells at me
[5:57:59] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> there's ONE specific item that is important since it's tied to a system for later that is too damn slow to build up
[5:58:10] <TheLaw3D4> I hate having to use items in games, just feels like I'm cheating my way out of the challenge
[5:58:18] <starlitalpha> theyre encouraging people to use items because they know people dont and even punished them for it in their previous games
[5:58:20] <%PauliusMaximus> im excited to see how river city girls is cause thats out now
[5:58:23] <GrumblingThrone> mabey you can see the platforms with you iris

[5:58:39] <$waxpants> MrDestructoid100 when you gonna start playing starsector
[5:58:41] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> there's also some challenge course things later that lock you into a certain used item loadout that is fun
[5:58:42] <jcflyguy> Lasts 1 minute
[5:58:45] <TheLaw3D4> I only used an item on the final boss. Not hating on item users though.
[5:58:45] <Monkeyweed21> SUPER RARE CONSUMABLE
[5:58:46] <%Keyd00d> never use it
[5:58:48] <%TheBitingIrish> @TheLaw3D4 No, they're there to catch your ass when you're not quite up to the challenge
[5:58:49] <artificiallynatural> boosts stats and recovers health
[5:58:50] <%mankeyfigh> @angriestpat have you tried Salvaging SCRAP? It gives you a shit ton of MONEY
[5:58:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It makes you a super saiyan.
[5:58:54] <%MegboyManuel> Lappy special is just Marie sweat
[5:58:59] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> like they give you nothing but grenades and stuff for enemies they are useful on
[5:59:01] <+CharredChord> don't knock the empty can!
[5:59:08] <%reonome> its an elixir, don't ever use it Kappa
[5:59:11] <%Keyd00d> @MegboyManuel I mean I wouldn't say no
[5:59:11] <%MegboyManuel> you know you want it.
[5:59:12] <TheLaw3D4> @TheBitingIrish Exactly, lets me skip the challenge instead of beating it.
[5:59:30] <+CharredChord> it is THE premiere stealth item
[5:59:33] <+valkuma> I hear Pat likes Hot Coca Cola
[5:59:34] <Monkeyweed21> I cant believe you have MEGA MILK
[5:59:42] <%MegboyManuel> What if Lappy special is just Marie's bath water
[5:59:43] <%d00msdaydan> gotta hold on to them in case you need them later
[5:59:48] <megaminimechamocha> Well FUCK, how am I supposed to be frugal adult AND save up to buy Astral Chain AND finish Three Houses AND buy River City Girls
[5:59:51] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 6 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 24oz (720mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[6:01:39] <Zombrocom> I mean, zeus was a flaming goo frog
[6:01:44] <HorribleHog> woah me've moved on from police force to homeless people
[6:01:47] <+JacketsNest101> How are we liking the game, pat?
[6:01:48] <%Cthulos> what were the DmC ones called with the cold tiddies?
[6:01:48] <TheLaw3D4> I wish there were a weapon switch wheel
[6:01:54] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> the suck was to a pun
[6:01:55] <Soul_Intern> No, someone else sucks Pat
[6:01:57] <%Keyd00d> "guys"
[6:01:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @phoenix7240 Goddess of the home as well.
[6:02:00] <Soul_Intern> Not you
[6:02:01] <%BoboDaHobo> suck plus
[6:02:01] <This_is_Marco> that guy sucks

[6:02:10] <%Macbutters86> Papa pat
[6:02:12] <megaminimechamocha> S U C C KreyGasm
[6:02:12] <Sphincter_Spelunker> gimme the suck
[6:02:17] <+McSnazzyPants> @thelaw3d4 since there's only 3 there's no need for a wheel
[6:02:18] <+Jaromero435> Yeah but you didn't get the secret S++
[6:02:21] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Pat you would suck if you also said a pun RIGHT NOW
[6:02:21] <%MegboyManuel> the anime like to match random western names and words to in-appropriate designs and ideas
[6:02:24] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> then it would work
[6:02:26] <+JacktheMan18> S+ could have done better Kappa
[6:02:27] <+CaptainGrime> @TheLaw3D4 do you not see the literal weapon wheel in the bottom left?
[6:02:29] <%Cthulos> why a weapon switch wheel, when you got a weapon-switching Heel? apatElmo
[6:02:55] <%BoboDaHobo> oh no I'm getting too drunk and I'm not following chat anymore
[6:02:55] <phoenix7240> @too_much_nukie still doesnt explaine what about its design has to do with hestia to warrent using her name
[6:02:58] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> that was a whoopsi doodle
[6:02:58] <%MegboyManuel> time for dog mount
[6:03:07] <Mastigias> "Shlorp" - Elmo
[6:03:08] <megaminimechamocha> ELMO

[6:03:11] <Sphincter_Spelunker> turn camera, show emlo
[6:03:12] <TheLaw3D4> @CaptainGrime I mean hold button plus press stick. I just want consistency .
[6:03:12] <+GalacticaPhanto> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[6:03:16] <megaminimechamocha> Elmo gives his own S U C C
[6:03:19] <%mankeyfigh> Use digging for SPEED
[6:03:30] <%mankeyfigh> DOGGO
[6:03:32] <$Mothman742> @angriestpat are u excited for the double rajang arena quest coming with icebourne?
[6:03:38] <CrypticMochi> Elmo mist goldmine the bag
[6:03:39] <TheLaw3D4> Or, something like, dpad up for gun, right for sword, down for big sword
[6:03:45] <+CaptainGrime> @TheLaw3D4 hey im just saying its there i didnt say it was good LUL
[6:03:47] <CrypticMochi> Must*
[6:03:47] <al0nem0nster> does Pat not like riding the dog?
[6:04:02] <Sphincter_Spelunker> FailFish
[6:04:02] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> it does control kinda awkward
[6:04:06] <%MegboyManuel> the dog riding controls arent the best
[6:04:06] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> little slippery
[6:04:10] <%dekkitout> Let the boy go down on himself
[6:04:28] <megaminimechamocha> Sometimes you just get a hankering to suck nuts
[6:04:32] <%MegboyManuel> sometimes I wish I had cat flexibility
[6:04:34] <TheLaw3D4> Pat his just jealous because he can't suck his own nuts
[6:04:56] <%Cthulos> r/selffuck ?!?!?!?!
[6:05:03] <cureneckbeard> he can suck one of his nuts into his abdomen
[6:05:07] <%SilvaChariot0133> 👀
[6:05:14] <%MegboyManuel> Shlorpy
[6:05:17] <TheLaw3D4> so can yer mum
[6:05:34] <starlitalpha> beast controls terribly
[6:05:35] <%MegboyManuel> didnt know thoe blocks were lethal
[6:05:56] <%SilvaChariot0133> Peekaboo
[6:05:58] <%reonome> monkaS
[6:06:07] <DSD24> @starlitalpha He goes from 0 to 11 too fast
[6:06:28] <HiggsV> Wtf this game looks sick, how have I never heard of it
[6:06:33] <TheLaw3D4> Weird single enemy
[6:06:39] <+JacketsNest101> beast is great for straight line speed but is kinda hard to control in precision platforming
[6:06:41] <starlitalpha> jesus, i couldnt place my finger on it but youre right
[6:06:47] <megaminimechamocha> @HiggsV I dunno, I've heard a ton about it recently
[6:06:58] <%Scrub_Seeker> @AngriestPat earlier i think i saw a gunner drone in your inventory that had a carry capacity of 1/1 where the other drones had x/99, maybe its a special item?
[6:06:58] <%MegboyManuel> beast is probably worst to use in these platforming sections
[6:07:06] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @HiggsV most people in the Platinum Games circle talked about it a lot
[6:07:10] <HiggsV> @megaminimechamocha guess I've been under a rock or somethin'
[6:07:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Character action is a niche genre.
[6:07:27] <+JacketsNest101> @megboymanuel you say that. but you need him in some spots
[6:07:27] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> yeah it is too huh
[6:07:29] <%MegboyManuel> @HiggsV dwayne's pretty hot so i dont blame you
[6:07:30] <megaminimechamocha> @HiggsV The algorithm probably just shat on you for a couple months
[6:07:34] <implied_consent> Why did I ghet an ad for spyro when it's been out forever.
[6:07:35] <TheLaw3D4> @HiggsV It's a platinum game that was announced in a major Direct
[6:07:44] <%SilvaChariot0133> RIP
[6:07:48] <%MegboyManuel> @JacketsNest101 i know, i fell down so many times trying to make tight turns Orz
[6:07:50] <starlitalpha> spyro came on on switch yesterday
[6:07:50] <%SilvaChariot0133> You played yourself
[6:07:50] <TheLaw3D4> Say hi to patrick for me

[6:08:07] <+JacketsNest101> Okay, time to beat the final boss

[6:10:05] <%miguelrod777> digusting
[6:10:06] <%tweedler92> Big game is long
[6:10:07] <%Keyd00d> he's... kinda almost getting to the almost end of the rile
[6:10:12] <%Keyd00d> *file
[6:10:16] <%Dr_Mooose> SourPls
[6:10:17] <Sphincter_Spelunker> haha you guys love each other
[6:10:19] <%LiquidShake83> was that woolie?
[6:10:22] <%InugamiTheHound> @implied_consent guns are legal but only 5 rounds max
[6:10:37] <%MegboyManuel> Pat was actually on call with Woolie, yes
[6:10:58] <%asmistake> halfway through the game i forgot how to deal with the tethered shield fuckers
[6:11:10] <%asmistake> it was so frustrating
[6:11:26] <Soul_Intern> Wonder what kinf of hate messages Pat is getting
[6:11:35] <jcflyguy> Arrow slow mo
[6:11:46] <DSD24> @asmistake Slice them with sword legion or shoot them with Arrow, if they are in the ground than use Beast
[6:11:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Time for arrow
[6:12:03] <+Estuko> LUL
[6:12:05] <%reonome> LUL
[6:12:09] <%Keyd00d> I don't even feel the gyro
[6:12:11] <Marpolo13> bummer
[6:12:11] <%MegboyManuel> muscle guy is a glorified door opener?
[6:12:12] <garagon31> sipsipDab
[6:12:18] <%InugamiTheHound> LUL
[6:12:21] <%asmistake> right, i forgot about the sword slash until by chance i went into a fight against them with IRIS on
[6:12:27] <%asmistake> and the sword logo came up
[6:12:45] <%asmistake> i felt like such an idiot because that's like item 3 you learn to do with Swordy
[6:12:52] <%MegboyManuel> i love how 3 of the stands have essential combat abilities, and the big muscle guy just opens doors
[6:12:55] <@PeachSaliva> @Soul_Intern 'hateful' is a rather strong term
[6:13:10] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Sore Winner
[6:13:17] <cureneckbeard> elmo is a rather strong cat
[6:13:17] <Soul_Intern> @PeachSaliva Nothing is strong enough when it comes to you Peach
[6:13:20] <DSD24> @asmistake Don't feel bad my first encounter with those shield dudes I wasn't able to figure out how to beat them till I used Sword Legion
[6:13:24] <%garagon31> garagon31 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[6:13:53] <starlitalpha> @asmistake thats the problem with games that dont constantly make players use their skills the whole ame
[6:13:57] <megaminimechamocha> I'm half convinced Pat's Requiem Stand has just created all the people currently defending his weak Sans Mii Fighter defense
[6:13:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> You tried
[6:13:58] <Soul_Intern> Nice talk PAt
[6:14:15] <megaminimechamocha> "Boy you're a lot of you" - Pat
[6:14:19] <Marpolo13> so chat, I've been here for like 5-10 min. Since last stream has their been any major story development in terms of badguys?
[6:14:21] <%MegboyManuel> Paige has a better stake for winning than Pat does because lack of Doom guy
[6:14:23] <%asmistake> truth, i don't think i used sword mode outside of puzzles and the shield babys
[6:14:23] <Soul_Intern> YOOOOOOOOO
[6:14:26] <+Estuko> monkaS
[6:14:27] <al0nem0nster> did I read that attack +25 right?
[6:14:28] <Soul_Intern> WHAT THE FUCK
[6:14:28] <%PauliusMaximus> SourPls
[6:14:30] <nevan0> yo

[6:14:46] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Creme tartar us
[6:14:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> She says Tartarus wrong.
[6:14:46] <+Estuko> USE YOUR HULK HANDS STAND PAT
[6:14:49] <%dekkitout> Now that's a punchi boi
[6:14:50] <%Ion_Laser> Woah! apatBig
[6:14:50] <%velemi> Cheer10000 Hey Pat, popping in while I watch an earlier vod of this to say Paige was right, suck it, just admit she won
[6:15:06] <%MegboyManuel> LOL Vel
[6:15:08] <cureneckbeard> Paige did nothing wrong
[6:15:09] <phoenix7240> Yup they deff just stuffed greek names into a hat and picked them at random
[6:15:10] <$HyperionXV> raysL
[6:15:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This is your first Class 9 enemy Pat. Don't fuck it up.
[6:15:11] <%asmistake> dropping that BIG money

[6:15:30] <%SilvaChariot0133> 👀
[6:15:30] <%MegboyManuel> drop big money to enforce a solid argument
[6:15:45] <%MegboyManuel> is...beast just bladewolf???
[6:15:48] <Sphincter_Spelunker> If you have to bribe to prove yourself right, you;re wrong :)
[6:15:54] <al0nem0nster> yes beast is just bladewolf
[6:16:06] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @phoenix7240 I think they make like one name make sense and then just derp. The Hestia one is nonsense, I think they named the biggest arrow chimera Artemis for the hunt and then were just like, OK now all the rest are whatever female dieties
[6:16:09] <%asmistake> i love Round Sword
[6:16:29] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Round sword and Triple Sword later are fun
[6:16:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They explain the names in the logs. They're all flimsy but make sense.
[6:16:41] <%MegboyManuel> lets name the nex massive gorilla enemy, Aphrodite
[6:16:45] <DSD24> Crush!
[6:16:55] <Soul_Intern> YEAAAAAAH

[6:17:03] <Soul_Intern> Fuckinh HYPE
[6:17:07] <%asmistake> this soundtrack tho
[6:17:09] <Derkinstacker> Best fight.
[6:17:12] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> oh yeah in the datalogs but yeah it sounds realistically like some person in the Neuron datalog is just running out of names lol
[6:17:16] <Sphincter_Spelunker> o rite, douglas
[6:17:18] <megaminimechamocha> Wait is there some limit on using Medicine? Because he's using them a lot.
[6:17:20] <butthurtdave> So does hitting the sync during a finisher do anything special? It doesnt look like Pat gets any extra cores or rewards from it
[6:17:22] <%reonome> ARE YOU OKAY
[6:17:27] <SleepyMaribo> River City Girls come out tomorrow
[6:17:35] <megaminimechamocha> BUSTAAAAAAAH WAULFF
[6:17:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @megaminimechamocha This game doesn't have item usage affect the rating in anyway.
[6:17:38] <Soul_Intern> Cute boy
[6:17:44] <%MegboyManuel> Hal's kinda cute
[6:17:45] <Zombrocom> Woah, Hal is crazy looking
[6:17:46] <Sphincter_Spelunker> you did it
[6:17:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @butthurtdave Makes the enemy explode and damage other enemies.
[6:17:49] <starlitalpha> i like how they grab someone and just put them safely at the edge of the level asleep
[6:17:50] <%PauliusMaximus> isnt it out now tchnically?
[6:17:52] <%MegboyManuel> i like his 2b voice
[6:17:57] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @megaminimechamocha you can only carry a certain amount, but you pick up a lot of temporary heal items that go away when you finish the file in addition to your standard inventory cap
[6:18:02] <DSD24> Here comes the rain
[6:18:09] <%shadowace2400> shit's about to go down
[6:18:11] <Derkinstacker> This is sick.
[6:18:13] <DSD24> Look at this rain texture

[6:19:06] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I still dunno how I feel about style in this game being entirely just doing lots of cool things, item use and damage taken don't really matter as much now

[6:19:18] <%starotter70> @doggieo It's a reddish blue
[6:19:20] <+Estuko> monkaS

[6:27:01] <megaminimechamocha> BIG DAMAGE
[6:27:03] <%Ion_Laser> Now that was a LAZOR
[6:27:03] <haveswordmuststing> Soulnados
[6:27:04] <%Keyd00d> DIVINE WINDSTORM
[6:27:05] <%InugamiTheHound> @DSD24 i said that already
[6:27:08] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> What is this fight holy crap
[6:27:08] <%chrishnaw> Thre goes the frame rate
[6:27:08] <Soul_Intern> WHAT IS EVEN GOING ON
[6:27:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Avoid the green lasers.
[6:27:15] <TheLaw3D4> @Too_Much_Nukie Truly a mind blowing strategy
[6:27:16] <+NeonBleu> what diffuculty is this?
[6:27:19] <LixFury> Oh dear, framerate bad
[6:27:19] <DSD24> @InugamiTheHound My apologies
[6:27:19] <%Keyd00d> RIP framerate
[6:27:20] <Zombrocom> Jesus
[6:27:20] <TheLaw3D4> Standard
[6:27:21] <Marpolo13> dont step in the soulnados Pat
[6:27:23] <%BestTeaMaker> so, here's the other part of the reason why ch6 is one of the best chapters
[6:27:23] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> it looks harder than that Agamemnon extra boss thing
[6:27:24] <InvaderKAZ> sTANDARD
[6:27:25] <%worldbrand> what the fuck do you do about tornadoes anyway
[6:27:26] <TheLaw3D4> but pat grinded tons
[6:27:28] <Zombrocom> The switch is dying
[6:27:29] <%Ion_Laser> @NeonBleu pt standard
[6:27:32] <42nfl19> I'M SO GLAD YOU FOUND THIS BOSS DURRING TH E RAIN SECTION
[6:27:32] <jaylabrando> sfhMUDA
[6:27:32] <%Keyd00d> pat ride the dog
[6:27:37] <C_Parkesy> @GrumblingThrone Its to catalog all the different enemy types
[6:27:40] <Malziel> fuckin' WOW
[6:27:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Dog is actually great in this fight.
[6:27:49] <+NeonBleu> I've never seen that laser
[6:27:52] <+IMCthulhu> item user SwiftRage
[6:27:55] <al0nem0nster> so that unchained skill mach rush, how much damage does it do with all 4 at once?
[6:27:57] <%dekkitout> Holy cow it's a real shame this game isn't one of those "Add the bosses to your team" games
[6:28:00] <doggieo> I didnt find this boss at all
[6:28:02] <%Keyd00d> I think dog can stay away fromt he cyclones better
[6:28:05] <WarchiefGoldva> Yo, that Dog Stand is pretty cool.
[6:28:06] <TheLaw3D4> Item user ><
[6:28:06] <GrumblingThrone> thanks
[6:28:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> When you ride the dog you negate the pull of the storms yes.
[6:28:19] <%GarbageNirvana> This game doesn't really penalize you for using items
[6:28:21] <starlitalpha> this game is full of secret crap like this
[6:28:28] <%worldbrand> i dont think you can actually get more than two or three legions out in practice
[6:28:32] <Zombrocom> This game actively encourages item use
[6:28:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And even when you aren't riding him the dog himself can outrun the pull of the storm.
[6:28:37] <KaliasTV> How come standard changed to 4 lives anyway?
[6:28:39] <%Keyd00d> gottem
[6:28:46] <%MegboyManuel> @Derkinstacker what was that about pat dying? apatHat
[6:28:47] <%GarbageNirvana> I think you get more points for using items than not using them actually
[6:28:49] <TheLaw3D4> Just because the game encorages them doesn't mean they aren't for PUSSies
[6:28:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @KaliasTV You gain more batteries for your defrib
[6:28:50] <%starotter70> Nice
[6:28:50] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Naisu
[6:28:51] <%worldbrand> @KaliasTV upgrading your legatus gives you more lives

[6:29:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> Nines blocks you
[6:29:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can only fight him in the storm.
[6:29:37] <%MegboyManuel> you gotta battle him in the storm so it looks cool
[6:29:38] <PartyTimeAustin> damn i missed that guy
[6:29:41] <Derkinstacker> Pat, if you want that mask that the guys have, im like 75% sure its behind a hidden wall in file 4.
[6:29:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> Fuck it tho
[6:29:47] <cureneckbeard> You were the lightning in that rain
[6:29:54] <%SilvaChariot0133> Shirtless in the rain or go home
[6:29:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah it does that in all footage I've seen.
[6:29:58] <%chrishnaw> Does the aliasing in this game not bother you? Game looks cool, but I can't get past the aliasing.
[6:30:00] <%starotter70> Man, this chapter has even more cool shit than I though
[6:30:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The Switch can't handle all that lightning and wind.
[6:30:12] <%GarbageNirvana> Drives me nuts when games decide to hide shit in spots like this where it makes absolutely no sense in the narrative to go exploring
[6:30:12] <%Keyd00d> this chapter is the length of some Platinum games
[6:30:13] <C_Parkesy> @dekkitout During the making of the Game yes, but they didn't have enough time to do all the bosses so you can only get a select few. Those being The Sword legion, Arrow, Arms, Beast, and Axe.

[6:30:33] <implied_consent> Both vinesauce streamers are live yet I chose you, Pat.
[6:30:37] <+McSnazzyPants> outside of that boss it does alright with the weather
[6:30:40] <%SilvaChariot0133> Imagine getting yeeted by a fucking Goomba
[6:30:43] <TheHeroAppears> @megaminimechamocha all the time
[6:30:43] <%Keyd00d> it was during the dmc1 lp wasn't it?
[6:30:50] <DSD24> @megaminimechamocha Pretty sure it was DMC 1
[6:30:51] <TheLaw3D4> Aliasing is worth all the other things this game has.
[6:31:01] <Soul_Intern> HWAAAAAT
[6:31:01] <%SilvaChariot0133> It's Fine
[6:31:01] <%dekkitout> That makes alot of sense given the way that flaming axe enemy from earlier was
[6:31:02] <%joylent_blue> yeah the dmc1 LP
[6:31:06] <Soul_Intern> THATS SO BAD
[6:31:06] <%spacehouse> cuz vinesauce plays Smash

[6:31:45] <WarchiefGoldva> I didn't catch the precious streams so I'm unaware of the lore, but does this game allow for multiplayer?

[6:31:55] <haveswordmuststing> @chrishnaw doodStare
[6:31:58] <+Muzzle131> @WarchiefGoldva it has co op
[6:32:00] <+xenogre> oh no it's sending the whole sector to the frame rate dimension
[6:32:08] <InvaderKAZ> The co op is very bad
[6:32:09] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @WarchiefGoldva Co-op, but the Player 2 controls the camera
[6:32:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Wait it has co-op?
[6:32:12] <+McSnazzyPants> @warchiefgoldva yes, one controls the cop one controls the stand
[6:32:12] <%MegboyManuel> the other player can play a stand lol
[6:32:13] <%worldbrand> it has couch co-op
[6:32:14] <%Keyd00d> the co-op is bad
[6:32:15] <Mushball> @WarchiefGoldva if you count coop with one of you playing as the stand then yeah it has multi
[6:32:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's terrible.
[6:32:17] <%starotter70> @chrishnaw cmonBruh

[6:32:32] <Soul_Intern> DOGGONADO
[6:32:32] <+Muzzle131> it has co-op i think kind of like Between two souls
[6:32:35] <+Tarage> Has doggo learned to like Pat yet or does it still want to eat his face?
[6:32:41] <Soul_Intern> YEAAAAAAH
[6:32:41] <WarchiefGoldva> DOG TORNADO
[6:32:50] <%starotter70> Yup
[6:32:50] <Zombrocom> It still very much wants to eat his face
[6:32:51] <%MegboyManuel> is this game just a better Beyond two souls?
[6:32:52] <%DeltascapeV4> DOGNADO
[6:32:53] <+Muzzle131> so one player controls the main character the other controls the legion
[6:32:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The stands do not like being stands.
[6:32:55] <%dekkitout> Borks gonna bark up a storm
[6:33:12] <+Muzzle131> i mean most games are better than beyond two souls
[6:33:14] <%Keyd00d> camera pls
[6:33:25] <WarchiefGoldva> The Stands are rebelling!
[6:33:28] <%Bt_Robot> Beast can't fly
[6:33:33] <starlitalpha> @MegboyManuel you sniff no ghostfarts in this game, for better or worse
[6:33:34] <%Keyd00d> the dog wants to fight but can't

[6:36:19] <%starotter70> Yeah, shit's bad
[6:36:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It sure is a good thing you came to this place that police are explicitly not allowed to be.
[6:36:21] <%worldbrand> STOP ALL THE DOWNLOADIN!
[6:36:27] <poweruser> no no these red shards do not go here, they clash with the blue
[6:36:28] <KaliasTV> bad times are due when the FPS dimension surrounds your house
[6:36:29] <Marpolo13> @BestTeaMaker i just want to go get some milk. I can deal with the rain, but Idk about dimensional cubes and shit
[6:36:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There are no survivors for something like this.
[6:36:36] <%Bt_Robot> It's just a little redshifted, it's still good it's still good!
[6:36:40] <%BestTeaMaker> no it's fine, it's just a cough
[6:36:44] <%BestTeaMaker> nothing bad happens
[6:36:49] <WarchiefGoldva> TechnoZombies.
[6:36:54] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat Hey, how often does the whole "they used to be people" talking point show up in this?

[6:37:11] <%worldbrand> to think you were dropping ice cream all over the floor a few hours ago
[6:37:12] <Valdorick> Did that small child just fucking die?
[6:37:14] <%king_wragles> Reall?
[6:37:15] <megaminimechamocha> Oh what's this, oh nothing, just an undercover police officer opening fire on sick civilians
[6:37:18] <%Keyd00d> no
[6:37:19] <KatabolicRage> it's been decades since all this started and most the planet got redshifted, people are past being shocked by it
[6:37:21] <megaminimechamocha> No big deal
[6:37:23] <%starotter70> Good thing they're legs weren't crushed
[6:37:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Not NEVER. But pretty uncommonly.
[6:37:25] <al0nem0nster> it's been going on for what 50 years at this point? think everyone's used to it
[6:37:27] <Marpolo13> I saved you now REWARD ME

[6:47:40] <%Keyd00d> he doesn't stop
[6:47:41] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> it's a good thing he got him low for THIS fucking part
[6:47:46] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> lets see how long til he figures it out
[6:47:48] <%SilvaChariot0133> He ain't gonna stop
[6:47:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> arrow time
[6:47:50] <Malziel> If only there were some sort of ranged stand
[6:47:52] <al0nem0nster> should probably switch to bullet and arrow
[6:47:53] <Malziel> or perhaps
[6:47:53] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Arrow brah
[6:47:59] <ShutenDragoon> matador time?
[6:48:00] <%BestTeaMaker> do a chain counter
[6:48:01] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> he doesn't use Arrow legion a lot tho
[6:48:02] <Marpolo13> if only we had a ranged thing
[6:48:02] <%InugamiTheHound> reminds me of "hook" boss from nier 1
[6:48:04] <%GarbageNirvana> You can if you don't eat shit in the process
[6:48:05] <Blank9> I didn't figure it out, I just shot gun until he died
[6:48:06] <%MoulesFritz> maybe use your RANGED STAND
[6:48:10] <gekizenbu> to be fair i got this one on accident
[6:48:11] <Valdorick> 100% reminds me of hook
[6:48:12] <agumon9000> This is one of the worst parts imo because there is nothing to indicate what you need to do in this phase
[6:48:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He's not gonna stop Pat.
[6:48:15] <+Edrem> He's charging
[6:48:17] <%asmistake> if only we could hit things from far away
[6:48:17] <WarchiefGoldva> Can you use the chain to trip the boss?
[6:48:18] <al0nem0nster> wait does chain counter work here?
[6:48:19] <Malziel> YEAAAAAAAAAAAH

[6:51:07] <+CaptainGrime> @MegalomaniacalMegalodon "my sisters got a great butt" Kreygasm
[6:51:07] <gryffinp> It's way harder to guess that it's the other twin when you picked the girl, because with the boy mc it's like oh it's a biker chick who could it be but when you're a girl it's an anonymous red man until he speaks
[6:51:09] <al0nem0nster> ...were their 17 different scores on that screen?
[6:51:10] <alrobot2014> did you think we were gonna get a sasuke retrieval arc?
[6:51:12] <megaminimechamocha> I usually play as girls in games where I can, but now I might play this game as a Guy just so my cool Rival can be my Sister.
[6:51:13] <jcflyguy> Put on the box!

[6:52:57] <TwistedVerse> rip it off her
[6:53:00] <DSD24> Nah its more specialized
[6:53:00] <TwistedVerse> take it
[6:53:01] <implied_consent> @megboymanuel "Now"
[6:53:04] <+JacktheMan18> Everything is better in black
[6:53:07] <+Muzzle131> at least she worries about us still
[6:53:07] <starlitalpha> says the idiot youve had to save repeatedly
[6:53:11] <%chrishnaw> If the default was black you'd want the blue one.
[6:53:13] <%InugamiTheHound> with big juicy "raven" on her ass
[6:53:13] <KoshiLowell> Your chain doesn't change color though
[6:53:14] <gryffinp> It's kind of ironic that pat has been running around in black and red, considering
[6:53:15] <megaminimechamocha> LOOK AT ALL THOSE UTILITY BELTS!
[6:53:15] <Wan6Saber> she doesnt look her age DansGame
[6:53:17] <%BioApple> oh god did she become as gods
[6:53:22] <Marpolo13> @starlitalpha right?
[6:53:22] <gryffinp> It's a way better contrast when you're still in blue
[6:53:24] <%MegboyManuel> why is she so hot now?
[6:53:26] <%starotter70> What if they also changed the hair to red
[6:53:28] <%Keyd00d> we made the slave chain stronger
[6:53:30] <TwistedVerse> because shes evil
[6:53:33] <%MegboyManuel> is it the black and red making her hot?
[6:53:34] <Sphincter_Spelunker> So the legions are gonna hate it more
[6:53:34] <al0nem0nster> Why is it Red.
[6:53:36] <%dekkitout> "Think" Riiight- like that time you "thought" when you got got by YOUR OWN LEGION!
[6:53:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> We made the legions bigger slaves.
[6:53:37] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @AngriestPat it has a severe OCD problem though the chain right now is still blue when you holster the Legatus, but when you pull out the Legion it turns red, bugs the HECK outa me
[6:53:37] <KoshiLowell> ....uh oh

[7:08:02] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat Twitch robbed me of half my message, so I wanted to ask you if you've played, or would consider playing, two games: Child of Light by Ubisoft Montreal, and GRIS by Nomada Studios. They're both very unique RPGs with fantastic soundtracks and beautiful art/worlds.
[7:08:04] <haveswordmuststing> @asmistake Bruce Willis was a stand all along?
[7:08:24] <$HyperionXV> Subway100 bonus10 These bits are in appreciation of your Jill sandwich shirt.
[7:08:31] <%Dr_Mooose> Gris is so pretty
[7:08:47] <%asmistake> @haveswordmuststing don't let Araki read that
[7:08:49] <42nfl19> YES...A SKIN
[7:08:57] <cureneckbeard> skeletons don't have skin
[7:08:59] <%Punchasaur> sans isn't on the character select screen, therefore he doesn't count
[7:09:01] <%RubberFistFight> @Dr_Mooose it really is. so many people pronounce it as "griss" though. It's "gree", sortof.
[7:09:02] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Sue the owner of other dog
[7:09:13] <%asmistake> australian dollars are called Dollary-doos, Pat
[7:09:17] <%starotter70> Damn
[7:09:39] <+Noni321> Woolie out there weebing it out in Japan
[7:10:04] <Valdorick> pat will do no such thing
[7:10:07] <Frostydough1> @AngriestPat Hey Pat have you seen the new Steven Universe movie? If not i reccommend it, shit's pretty good
[7:10:07] <%Punchasaur> she didn't
[7:10:08] <%RubberFistFight> BAN
[7:10:10] <%shockzndrawe> I can't watch these streams cuz I haven't played astral chain yet sadness
[7:10:11] <Sphincter_Spelunker> If you have to bribe to prove yourself right, you;re wrong :)
[7:10:13] <%asmistake> spending money in politics velemi
[7:10:16] <%shockzndrawe> I had to wait till now
[7:10:19] <Arnoldoaad1> ITS PLAYABLE!!
[7:10:25] <Arnoldoaad1> Lol
[7:10:26] <Valdorick> pat would NEVER admit he's wrong, because if he did, Crazy Talk would make him right, which would still make him wrong.
[7:10:28] <cureneckbeard> pat with the backdown
[7:10:31] <Soul_Intern> A bit of a smugness
[7:10:34] <%worldbrand> but what if doomguy is a full character one year from now?
[7:10:37] <%asmistake> @Valdorick my head hurts
[7:10:37] <cureneckbeard> valdorick: oh good point
[7:10:45] <%InugamiTheHound> half of a apologize note
[7:10:46] <ShichiNoBushi> If Doom Guy does get a proper playable character, then you win over Paige, for sure.
[7:10:46] <cureneckbeard> good guy pat.
[7:10:47] <+Whens_Marbles> DoomGuy will prolly be in Pack 2 Kappa
[7:10:48] <%starotter70> Every level!?
[7:11:00] <%Faustgesicht> By the word of the bet, Pat won. By the spirit of the bet, Paige won.
[7:11:05] <%worldbrand> I mean, the bet was who's in first, I guess
[7:11:09] <%Punchasaur> if you have to name a mii Sans, it's not actually sans
[7:11:12] <%Dr_Mooose> Doom Guy will never get in smash
[7:11:13] <Soul_Intern> What if Sans and Doomguy get in the same announcemt?
[7:11:32] <42nfl19> Technically Pat did not win. His bet was Doom Guy. So the bet is stll ongoing.
[7:11:41] <SomersaultJustice> 3 introduced the job system
[7:11:49] <%asmistake> what about Final Fantasy Adventure
[7:11:49] <%worldbrand> that's the best opinion on 8 i've heard
[7:12:03] <starlitalpha> if the sans skin counts, then saki, tails, and chibi robo are all in smash as well
[7:12:08] <$HyperionXV> I half expect that the Doom64 in november22 is just so that doom will have been on a nintendo console when they announce the 5th dlc character that month when Terry releases
[7:12:13] <%worldbrand> X-3: tidus blitzball mine
[7:12:16] <Valdorick> Time for Pat to get 5 years worth of corrections on that statement.
[7:12:16] <%Bt_Robot> There is still one more reveal this season, then five more next season.
[7:12:18] <alrobot2014> the fact that its still around is crazy
[7:12:24] <cureneckbeard> bleetzboll
[7:12:27] <Blank9> don't worry, 12 didn't finish 12
[7:12:31] <Sphincter_Spelunker> 13 had 3 games NotLikeThis

[7:12:36] <alrobot2014> 12 the zodiac age has all of that now btw
[7:12:37] <haveswordmuststing> XII really benefits from being on a handheld
[7:12:45] <%asmistake> can't believe they made 3 ffXIIIs
[7:12:47] <ShichiNoBushi> Tactics?
[7:13:00] <%InugamiTheHound> type-0???

[7:13:03] <%chrishnaw> Theatrhythm?
[7:13:11] <starlitalpha> @asmistake they made 3 because some guy at square wanted to marry lightning
[7:13:12] <haveswordmuststing> @asmistake and a spinoff that never came out Kappa
[7:13:15] <alrobot2014> 012 Duodecim

[7:13:21] <%Punchasaur> FF XIII 2: II
[7:13:23] <Shwepie> What about Final Fantasy Adventure and Final Fantasy Mystic Quest?
[7:13:23] <Valdorick> I think the best Final Fantasy is Tactic Ogre: Let us Cling Together Kappa
[7:13:31] <%asmistake> when you really like your OC
[7:13:39] <DracaenaLeaf> night
[7:13:44] <Sphincter_Spelunker> what dat
