The best SMG is the locust you get from Kasumi's mission, the best Assault rifle is the Mattock, and the best armour is the Kestral armour from Illium.  Also dont do all anomalies because you legit can run out of missions to refresh your teammates conversations.

[0:18:01] <%BigCoffee> I think about RE2 on a weekly basis, RE8 was good but it wasnt close, and re3r hurts :(
[0:18:07] <%Reveresao> Reveresao subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! Hi, Orbman. I finally beat 13 Robots good game. I did not see it at the time, but you were right on best girl. I wish there were puzzle/knowledge checks.

[0:18:44] <notsoy> did they fix that, btw? for a while, Yakuza Kiwami 2 was gone and you had to list it as Yakuza 2
[0:18:47] <peachy996> They changed it Today too
[0:18:48] <%GarbageNirvana> tbf they did a fanfuckingtastic job on RE2R
[0:18:50] <%spoiledbadger> lol
[0:18:52] <%derpy_platypus> sucks to suck
[0:18:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> You could just cheat.
[0:18:53] <acridpaladin> just do your taxes in ME2
[0:18:54] <%Treuan> Sadge
[0:18:57] <%ScottishMadJacko> hey paige is back

[0:19:04] <+Shockrates20XX> Gotta patch those single player games.
[0:19:04] <Profmcstevie> SPACE TAXES AT IT AGAIN
[0:19:05] <%maenos2> paige should talk more into her mic btw she's still pretty distant sounding
[0:19:08] <$RealThiele> ADHD wins!
[0:19:09] <yourliteraldog> SUP Fam
[0:19:10] <%heartlesshealer> that's how it be
[0:19:11] <%walternatorz> you know she can't hear or see or breathe while reading
[0:19:15] <dauver> LUL
[0:19:16] <thetunnelhomer> I wish they did inheritance tax like that in real life.
[0:19:18] <macathelo> maybe she'is on the drugs
[0:19:18] <%LumberjackJack> What if she was reading Mass Effect codex, tho?
[0:19:22] <balthazar758> p
[0:19:24] <$lumporr> :/
[0:19:26] <Profmcstevie> She's eternally lost
[0:19:27] <+Allyofwar> Ya I bought everything on omega on my first trip and still had 300,000 credits. It was awesome.
[0:19:34] <Pookiedaexzile> "I've never left teh fortilla"
[0:19:40] <%Monkeyweed21> mental disabilities make Pat PP hard
[0:19:44] <%heartlesshealer> wha

[0:19:57] <bob900000> guess I'm not doing all of them
[0:20:01] <$RealThiele> bioware magic
[0:20:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Grunt is my son
[0:20:01] <%derpy_platypus> and money
[0:20:04] <Profmcstevie> Completion bonuses that suck are the biggest bummer
[0:20:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> Same reason most things get cut.
[0:20:08] <%Monkeyweed21> BIOWARE MAGIC
[0:20:08] <spawnzie> that's usually th reason
[0:20:12] <$Ziegsy> my reading comprehension is low right now and thought fortilla was tortilla
[0:20:15] <thetunnelhomer> Grunt is Shepard's babby
[0:20:16] <Ipsenscastle> ME2 was amazingly complete for such a short turnaround
[0:20:17] <%kyh9> PAIGE PLAY MASS EFFECt
[0:20:18] <TheMostAverageGamer4> yess ME2
[0:20:20] <peachy996> It's best it wasnt in the final game
[0:20:21] <+Bail_Seven> she wont even remember the spoils
[0:20:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> You wont remember Paige
[0:20:22] <%valriot> ERRRR
[0:20:23] <buhbuhboat> I think Thane and Jacob had one as well but I'm not sure
[0:20:25] <ttc_lover> PAIIIIIIIGGGGEEEEEEEEE
[0:20:25] <%DrTomT18> Grunt is your son
[0:20:25] <%Monkeyweed21> Remember that it is miraculous these games even got finished
[0:20:27] <bob900000> boooooo
[0:20:27] <+MelodyMedley> Always time
[0:20:29] <tanarath> Paige, no, stay
[0:20:31] <dauver> didn't ME 2 have a fairly decent development time?
[0:20:31] <$lumporr> what's goin on
[0:20:32] <%heartlesshealer> fics???
[0:20:32] <%Arancet> good save pat
[0:20:34] <marvel877> show feet
[0:20:34] <%logoth_> stop ihhhttt
[0:20:36] <peachy996> Grunt and Mordin having beef seemed unrealistic
[0:20:36] <+Sadira_snack_attack> but she won't remember anyway
[0:20:37] <$RealThiele> swing and a miss
[0:20:40] <%spoiledbadger> yeah
[0:20:43] <+Shockrates20XX> I wish they had integrated Chat Choice into ME decisions.
[0:20:44] <+MightyDuckShoes> Mistakes were made
[0:20:46] <thetunnelhomer> Jacob is way more racist than I remember
[0:20:50] <%logoth_> How did Zangief welcome Peach?
[0:20:51] <%justnathan18> Pats gotta ring too tho
[0:20:55] <thetunnelhomer> i wonder what bioware was going for
[0:20:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Grunt is too dumb to care about the future
[0:20:57] <joapple_> there's such a good story about Thane's romance line "I want you, Thane" right after he talks about his dead wife
[0:20:58] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige stay fuck spoilers
[0:20:59] <%democrazyyy> zangief makes me wish i had a bulldog
[0:20:59] <ioci2112> it should be grunt and garrus, grunt hates turians and you can tell him to don't touch garrus
[0:21:02] <Ipsenscastle> @buhbuhboat lol I would lose Jacob's loyalty to get him killed for fun, Thane rules
[0:21:06] <Pookiedaexzile> and too innocent to under stand the sex
[0:21:12] <marvel877> did Gief tackle her when she came home?
[0:21:13] <%StevorenoElcamino> Since a toilet seat has a hole for your butt, isn’t that also a butt hole?
[0:21:15] <%justnathan18> James is the only human soldier character that doesnt suck
[0:21:20] <%Arancet> power of treat is still slightly stronger than power of paige
[0:21:21] <Coystick> Now feed Paige
[0:21:23] <peachy996> Yeah Jacob hates Thane for some deumbass reason
[0:21:27] <%heartlesshealer> <3

[0:21:53] <%Ranryu692> Paige is back!

[0:30:52] <@SSaryn> There's gonna be weird fanart of this I hope you know this.
[0:30:52] <%justnathan18> I legit take off my shirt to eat if the food involves any kind of sauce.

[0:33:45] <%linSP> local ginger found with head and cereal in toilet
[0:33:48] <+TheBigO75> I never knew that
[0:33:50] <$RealThiele> paige goes to use gun and the recoil gets her and pat
[0:33:50] <DatAsuna> Yeah ME2's rpg aspects are dumb
[0:33:51] <%Monkeyweed21> IS THAT WHY I DIDNT MAX PARAGON?
[0:33:56] <Basch71> which class is pat going
[0:33:57] <peachy996> Yeah the Mattock is the shit
[0:33:57] <$KetsuoTaberu> yes
[0:33:57] <%MidnightBurst12> the locust is busted
[0:33:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's dumber than you think Pat. You can max out RENEGADE AND PARAGON BOTH in this game if you max out your class skill first.
[0:33:57] <Pookiedaexzile> BIOTIC CHARGE
[0:33:59] <@SSaryn> Yeah Mattock was pretty damn good.
[0:33:59] <spongeofmystery> MATTOCK GANG REPRESENT
[0:33:59] <%GarbageNirvana> although I also have a leak coming from the second floor
[0:34:02] <%Varlinator> It is what it is
[0:34:06] <%DJFakie> One of your specializations doubles the morality multiplier
[0:34:09] <peachy996> Leave the Anomalies for Legion to go on
[0:34:09] <@SSaryn> Wait wat
[0:34:09] <$KnightAsteran> Mattock is pog
[0:34:10] <austinj24> FUCK YEAH THE LOCUST IS THE SHIT
[0:34:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEY MATTOCK
[0:34:13] <%TheotherKristian> That makes sense
[0:34:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> Anamolies are side quests.
[0:34:17] <DatAsuna> THey're the boring sidequests
[0:34:17] <$KnightAsteran> Anomalies are the scanner missions
[0:34:17] <%zyberion626> anamolies are just little side missions
[0:34:18] <%walternatorz> planet exporation
[0:34:21] <%DJFakie> Basically unexplored planeta
[0:34:21] <%valriot> Im literally playing it, and i dont understand
[0:34:22] <LluthyY> from planet scanning
[0:34:23] <DatAsuna> the super low budget ones
[0:34:25] <$KnightAsteran> where you scan the planets
[0:34:25] <%Varlinator> N7 missions
[0:34:26] <%justnathan18> We'll get there
[0:34:27] <Tracazoid> Rotate them saves! That's what it means
[0:34:27] <%valriot> LUL
[0:34:28] <IndoorSitup> MATTOCK IS THE BEST FUCKING WEAPON IN ALL OF MASS EFFECT
[0:34:29] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt If you do all missions, then get Legion, you legit will not have enough missions to do for more dialouge
[0:34:29] <peachy996> They are basically side missions that don't have a real plot
[0:34:32] <%rkbinder> Don't Binge missions, need dialogue
[0:34:32] <%twistedj3ster> OH
[0:34:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Dont do every sidequest all in one go
[0:34:36] <%afronooch> you have plenty one guy is wrong
[0:34:38] <%BigCoffee> Don't do every anomaly one by one before doing every real missions. They reset the convos
[0:34:38] <Alzero83> PLanet Scanning Anamolies @PatStaresAt
[0:34:41] <+DeadlyPeaks> Side missions
[0:34:41] <%Lizard0TM> if you do them all you lose dialogue
[0:34:43] <%Dfreddy8> ONE GUY
[0:34:44] <+InhumanMilitia> Loyalty missions wont trigger
[0:34:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Your team mates need to go on missions to give you the chance to further their conversations.
[0:34:45] <tanarath> LEGION
[0:34:46] <DatAsuna> Basically just space out sidequests instead of doing them all asap
[0:34:46] <%patriotrenegade> When did Paige get home?
[0:34:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MATTOCK, LOCUST, WIDOW= PROFIT
[0:34:50] <%Gogogolem> Gogogolem subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 53 months, currently on a 53 month streak! What's the difference between a poorly dressed man on a bicycle and a nicely dressed man on a tricycle? A tire.
[0:34:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> So you need to do shit to get more conversations?
[0:35:00] <Broken_Sonex> Yeah just ignore that One Guy moment
[0:35:02] <peachy996> Pat wants to take Legion to the Flotilla though guys
[0:35:04] <$RealThiele> so get character takes priority over sidequests
[0:35:04] <thelonechris> Degenerates like you belong on a cross
[0:35:05] <%walternatorz> you recall having to do a mission to advance conversations with crew mates
[0:35:07] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> So just talk to your team between missions @PatStaresAt
[0:35:08] <viewtifulr> eyyy Pat lytHI
[0:35:09] <IndoorSitup> NotLikeThis
[0:35:10] <+TheBigO75> its really stupid
[0:35:10] <%valriot> WTF? No, once you get Legion, you go to the base wtf is this dude talking about
[0:35:10] <DatAsuna> You'll be fine
[0:35:10] <%Rumbutt> Don't worry about it
[0:35:10] <%democrazyyy> whats hard to get?
[0:35:11] <James_Quivers> Pro Tip: Get Tali ASAP to bang, okay?
[0:35:12] <%AzureGale> Legion is something of a lost cause anyway
[0:35:15] <%patriotrenegade> YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE
[0:35:16] <%HieloMcFly> So less dialog
[0:35:16] <+RyanTheRecluse> Team mates have more dialogue than just one set between main missions
[0:35:16] <%baka_sugoi> BRAIN DED
[0:35:17] <peachy996> This is literally episode 1 guys relax
[0:35:18] <T_Sasquatch> PAIGE IS BACK WOOO
[0:35:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hes wrong its fine Pat
[0:35:19] <iosephe> DOING A MISSION ADVANCES THE DIALOGUE
[0:35:22] <$RealThiele> the boobage
[0:35:23] <PanicSwytch> So leave the side missions for when u get legion?
[0:35:23] <T_Sasquatch> sorry i mean BOOO
[0:35:26] <$lumporr> god
[0:35:29] <%ArchimerCXV> as someone who had the game delay the IFF decryption to do legion's sidequest, this feels like a one-guy
[0:35:29] <%walternatorz> SO YOU DID BONE
[0:35:31] <Ipsenscastle> new dialogue only happens after a mission
[0:35:31] <Kain5707> big sex
[0:35:32] <+MightyDuckShoes> back to this!
[0:35:33] <%justnathan18> how many missions do you have to get through before the collectors start melting folks?

[0:35:43] <austinj24> fuckin zing
[0:35:44] <HaroldDonchee> UHH
[0:35:45] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[0:35:46] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt just get all the teammates first, also legions loyalty mission is available immediately
[0:35:47] <%zyberion626> don'tuh
[0:35:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt The triggers for the next phase of a team member's loyalty conversations require a mission in between important dialogue. So if you've already done all the side quests by the time you get Legion, you just can't progress through his dialogue tree after a certain point.
[0:35:49] <Profmcstevie> She's looking for space waves
[0:35:51] <%JoshManVGH> Sometime confusion trumps horney.
[0:35:51] <%Dfreddy8> Kappa
[0:35:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> WHOA
[0:35:53] <%hrbeck_> floopa floppa
[0:35:53] <peachy996> Anomaly Missions should be done though, I think they're neat
[0:35:53] <$KetsuoTaberu> he does tell people all the time
[0:35:54] <$Ziegsy> missions refreshes the talky. you want it all you need missions remaining to refresh
[0:35:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's new
[0:35:54] <%patriotrenegade> UHHHH
[0:35:55] <%BigCoffee> With legion on board you need to do anomalies after to hear his unique dialogue. If you ran out of anomalies, you will have less special dialogue. Leave some side missions for the very end.
[0:35:56] <DatAsuna> hi paige's mom
[0:35:57] <Basch71> the only mission to keep in mind is the IFF mission since thats the endgame
[0:35:59] <%derpy_platypus> tits
[0:35:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> Like, 40% of the time?
[0:35:59] <%HieloMcFly> All The Time
[0:36:00] <%SaiyanShoto> Who has the better tits, Pat or Paige?
[0:36:01] <+Kaiserzelcor> @PatStaresAt Pat they are saying to get all the team mates before you do the rest of the side missions so you get all the dialogue chances
[0:36:02] <%augusm> augusm subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! Oh boy its been nearly a decade since I thought about Mass Effect 2. Time for BIG SPACE CUMS
[0:36:05] <%patriotrenegade> There’s the one good one
[0:36:05] <%afronooch> you only have time for 1 or 2 missions after legion, so you kinda have to do all of them before you get him
[0:36:08] <$RealThiele> this goes to tits
[0:36:08] <%DorianCreed> Not in those exact words, but yeah
[0:36:10] <TourettesPlays> @justnathan18 it depends on whether they're loyalty missions or not, Loyalty missions dont effect the time limit
[0:36:11] <%democrazyyy> pat
[0:36:12] <%Arancet> hasnt been the same without ya, paige

[0:37:03] <%Lizard0TM> YES
[0:37:04] <%DJFakie> Talk to everybody after everything, basically
[0:37:05] <%Raikouija> What did I just come into?
[0:37:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> AND DLC
[0:37:08] <+InhumanMilitia> Or legions
[0:37:09] <retrosadness> correct
[0:37:10] <DatAsuna> You can do non-loyalty side missions after the suicide mission
[0:37:12] <%valriot> YEYEYEYE
[0:37:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DONT FORGET DLC
[0:37:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> The problem is the timer that starts counting down to your crew dying in the collector base.
[0:37:16] <%Varlinator> Correct
[0:37:16] <%HanbaobaoZaiNar> HanbaobaoZaiNar subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Thanks for being the ideal mass effect distraction while finishing my PhD dissertation. Appreciate it!
[0:37:18] <+Bail_Seven> dont do Jacobs loyalty mission
[0:37:19] <$KetsuoTaberu> yup
[0:37:22] <Ipsenscastle> you need to do anomalies after the climax to hear all of Legion's dialogue
[0:37:24] <%valriot> Taking Legion to Talis mission is so gooooood
[0:37:24] <%MidnightBurst12> right
[0:37:25] <peachy996> Then do the DLC plus Anomoaly missions
[0:37:26] <%NateyBeak> or just hack legion in the game at the start so we have the best game
[0:37:27] <$RealThiele> course charted
[0:37:27] <@SSaryn> The day is saved I guess
[0:37:28] <%Lizard0TM> DLC is post game
[0:37:28] <%zyberion626> wait why do we postpone Tali?
[0:37:29] <%valriot> Do DLC literally whenever
[0:37:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> DLC fits in after the main game.
[0:37:29] <DatAsuna> wherever you want it to
[0:37:32] <Virokwet> dlc before iff
[0:37:34] <%VioletHeart> Arrival after you beat the game. Others do whenever.
[0:37:34] <thetunnelhomer> Wait can you do Tali's romance in that scenario?
[0:37:34] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Do all dlc before or after
[0:37:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can keep playing after you beat the game.
[0:37:37] <%patriotrenegade> I’ve never played Mass Effect but I like Jack
[0:37:38] <%democrazyyy> @PatStaresAt save arrival for postgame
[0:37:38] <acridpaladin> shame theres no mod to get legion first...
[0:37:38] <DatAsuna> Just do arrival last or the story gets stupid
[0:37:38] <+Deebo305> A
[0:37:39] <%MidnightBurst12> whenever
[0:37:39] <IndoorSitup> When does the Arrival DLC happen??
[0:37:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Do it b4 IFF
[0:37:40] <%DJFakie> Do Arrival in post-game at least
[0:37:40] <%Maids4lyfe> before RFF
[0:37:41] <%coward_man> DLC is after main game
[0:37:41] <%ArchimerCXV> can do DLC whenever
[0:37:43] <TourettesPlays> DLC CAN be post game, but can be done before IFF
[0:37:44] <+jerkhov> wasn't Zaed supposed to be in the original game
[0:37:44] <dd44dostivei> do DLC whenever
[0:37:46] <+D00msDayDan> cheat and get legion right out the gate
[0:37:46] <Basch71> the dlc's make sense time wise
[0:37:48] <%Dfreddy8> You could do DLC WHENEVER
[0:37:48] <%BigCoffee> shadow borker is between 2-3
[0:37:51] <%bassoontyphoon> Do it before
[0:37:52] <$Futurecity10> YOU MADE IT CONFUSING
[0:37:54] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Arrival is after the main story.
[0:37:54] <peachy996> The game doesn't end after the Suicide mission
[0:37:55] <wolfen091> overlord is usually whenever and broker and other one after
[0:37:57] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt DO ARRIVAL AFTER POSTGAME
[0:37:57] <%justnathan18> Zaeed is sick
[0:37:58] <Oxybe> @patstaresat do you still play fortnite and thoughts on the last season.
[0:38:00] <+critikal_bit> Personally did Arrival and Shadow Broker post-game
[0:38:01] <$antibonehurtingjuice> DO ARIVAL LAST
[0:38:04] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Won’t that kill Normandy crew?
[0:38:05] <%Varlinator> Overlord won't make sense if you do it after

[0:39:35] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[0:39:36] <%shadowsofpain> Wait Paige is back? So now not just slowly going insane?
[0:39:37] <Ipsenscastle> He could pay for a fake PAige though so we'd never know

[0:39:37] <Oxybe> le chienchien ne pousse pas les Paiges dans le fleuve saint-laurent!
[0:39:38] <Blank9> pat wearing gold in memory of paige
[0:39:38] <%HieloMcFly> We give him enough money
[0:39:39] <zerointelligence000> If Paige has a stab wound below her knee it's Pat
[0:39:39] <%patriotrenegade> No he’s right.
[0:39:40] <$lumporr> "If pat becomes a rapper, he killed me"
[0:39:41] <HaroldDonchee> nothing would change but gief would have a gold collar
[0:39:42] <%baka_sugoi> Supreme PAT
[0:39:45] <%justnathan18> WHy would Pat need sunglasses if he never leaves the house
[0:39:47] <%zyberion626> NOT GUILTY
[0:39:51] <%patriotrenegade> If Pat suddenly becomes tall
[0:39:51] <%stagemage> Pat with drip is a cursed idea
[0:40:00] <%Dfreddy8> She would probably just get lost herself
[0:40:04] <balthazar758> "i did it for the money"
[0:40:06] <+Daigrey> ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU IN THE JURY!!!
[0:40:07] <@SSaryn> "accidently" with the dick.
[0:40:08] <%JoshManVGH> "Chat press 1 if Homicide!"
[0:40:10] <spawnzie> Alright evevrybody got the clip?
[0:40:10] <TCDerps> clipped
[0:40:11] <$Ziegsy> I mean we have yet to SEE paige being back. This could all be pre recorded and shes already dead
[0:40:11] <%HieloMcFly> Ill kill you, especially those in the jury
[0:40:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat DLC is not post game. The missions unlock during the game. Important ones are Overlord, Arrival, and Zaeed/Kasumi. Make sure to do Overlord and Arrival before the Reaper IFF.
[0:40:13] <%linSP> your honor, the prosecution rests
[0:40:14] <+gregpivo> It's on tape now
[0:40:15] <$RealThiele> glad we got that on video
[0:40:16] <zhenthrim213> ill fucking do it again
[0:40:16] <%heartlesshealer> came back from vacuuming. Is Pat telling Paige about david cage trial?
[0:40:17] <%MidnightBurst12> Here lies Paige. She scored too hard.
[0:40:26] <%Monkeyweed21> ah Pat runs on F.A.T.A.L. rules
[0:40:27] <peachy996> Pat you would be the type to OJ it "If I did it Here's How"
[0:40:27] <Coystick> A crime of passion
[0:40:34] <$antibonehurtingjuice> NO
[0:40:35] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Arrival post game
[0:40:35] <%Lizard0TM> yes
[0:40:36] <+D_day> No
[0:40:36] <RedPlasticCup> yes
[0:40:36] <$RealThiele> isnt overlord ME 1?
[0:40:37] <Alzero83> Arrival IS JUST before ME3
[0:40:37] <%shurtal> YUP
[0:40:37] <%DJFakie> Yes it is
[0:40:38] <DatAsuna> DO NOT DO ARRIVALK BEFORE IT
[0:40:38] <$antibonehurtingjuice> YES
[0:40:38] <%VioletHeart> Arrival is SUPER post game
[0:40:40] <Halospaz117> Arrival is SUPER post game
[0:40:40] <dauver> Arrival should be done post game
[0:40:40] <%shadowsofpain> yes
[0:40:40] <retrosadness> arrival is post game, overlord is pre
[0:40:41] <$Futurecity10> You can do it pre but it makes no sense
[0:40:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Nope
[0:40:41] <Ipsenscastle> Arrival is super post game
[0:40:42] <%dave323dave> arrival is the bridge between 2 and 3
[0:40:42] <IndoorSitup> DO ARRIVAL LAST FUCK ONE GUY
[0:40:43] <%JoshManVGH> Start making fun of the future judge who tries to convict you.
[0:40:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> Arrival and Shadow Broker are EXPLICITLY post game.
[0:40:43] <%coward_man> Arrival is super for real post game
[0:40:44] <+gespenst25> arrival CAN be done post game I'm sure it can
[0:40:45] <CreepyUncleCross> ARRIVAL IS POST
[0:40:45] <drawerinkshow> Yes and no
[0:40:45] <%zyberion626> You can do Arrival prior but narratively it fits better post game
[0:40:45] <wolfen091> story wise yes
[0:40:45] <RedPlasticCup> arrival post game
[0:40:46] <BrOOnoh> arrival i better post
[0:40:46] <Virokwet> Arrival is best post game
[0:40:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> It unlocks b4
[0:40:47] <dd44dostivei> do them whenever
[0:40:47] <%Lizard0TM> I JUST PLAYED THE GAME
[0:40:48] <%stagemage> It can be
[0:40:48] <%ArchimerCXV> yall got some weird ideas how to do your DLCs
[0:40:48] <Meekest> No yes no yes no yes
[0:40:49] <$KetsuoTaberu> I think arrival is post game
[0:40:49] <%Monkeyweed21> ARRIVAL IS THE LAST THING
[0:40:49] <%Varlinator> SUPER POST-GAME
[0:40:49] <%maenos2> you can do arrival efore but it changes something
[0:40:49] <+Shockrates20XX> not necessarily
[0:40:49] <+jerkhov> This is some Kingdom Hearts shit
[0:40:50] <%Maids4lyfe> ARRIVAL IS SUPER POST
[0:40:50] <ARDM112> Do Arrival after the main mission if you want to see real Harbringer
[0:40:50] <%Lizard0TM> IT'S POST GAME
[0:40:51] <+Bail_Seven> do arrival post game
[0:40:52] <%DJFakie> Only do Arrival post game
[0:40:52] <Alzero83> Save Arrival for AFTER you beat the game @PatStaresAt
[0:40:52] <dauver> yes
[0:40:52] <%MidnightBurst12> Arrival is post
[0:40:54] <%AzureGale> Yes, Arrival leads right into ME3
[0:40:54] <+Allyofwar> Arrival should the last thing you do.
[0:40:54] <+Shockrates20XX> It's very late.
[0:40:55] <%democrazyyy> @PatStaresAt arrival should be the very last thing. firewalker is basically a tutorial for overlord. everything else can be done whenever
[0:40:55] <IndoorSitup> DO ARRIVAL LAST
[0:40:55] <DatAsuna> Arrival can be done whenever but it makes the story STUPID
[0:40:55] <Basch71> Arrival is outright the story before ME3
[0:40:56] <%HieloMcFly> yeah
[0:40:57] <%twistedj3ster> chat is helping!
[0:40:59] <Ipsenscastle> Arrival LAST yes
[0:40:59] <%Varlinator> OVERLORD PRE-IFF
[0:40:59] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Arrival is post game but you get earlier.
[0:40:59] <peachy996> What is this weird ass advice you are getting?
[0:41:01] <+Rikufmix21> you can import post games saves just do it after the main game
[0:41:03] <Pookiedaexzile> One Guy
[0:41:03] <Profmcstevie> Holy shit people this isn't hard stop being dumb
[0:41:04] <%Garthunox> NO DONT DO ARRIVAL BEFORE THE COLLECTOR BASE OMG WHO IS SO WRONG?
[0:41:04] <%maenos2> if you do arrival before you finish it changes a character's image
[0:41:06] <@SSaryn> I love Twitch chat sometimes.
[0:41:06] <%LumberjackJack> You can do Arrival pre-finale, but it feels weird if you do it before the finale
[0:41:06] <%shadowsofpain> everything except Arrivals is pre iff
[0:41:06] <%ArchimerCXV> Pat? just play game, leave chat behind with their weird rituals
[0:41:07] <IndoorSitup> SAVE ARRIVAL FOR LAST
[0:41:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Arrival is super duper post game BUT if you do it before the final boss you do get A SINGLE unique line of dialogue.
[0:41:10] <%Maids4lyfe> arrival is absolutely last
[0:41:11] <%saadi90> Do Arrival and shadow broker post game
[0:41:15] <ape_hawk> did i miss pat smearing his dick all over tali's mask?
[0:41:18] <+InhumanMilitia> remember you need to have almost max paragon to get both sides to be cool with you after tali and legion fight
[0:41:21] <@SSaryn> 5G SQUAD
[0:41:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Paragon later
[0:41:23] <SpaceGuntank> yes
[0:41:23] <Halospaz117> SO MANY G'S
[0:41:26] <DatAsuna> "Rhetoric: Say one of these paragon or renegade things or fuck off"
[0:41:35] <%Reveresao> \
[0:41:37] <$RealThiele> 5G 5G 5G!
[0:41:37] <Broken_Sonex> ARIVAL IS THE LAST THING NOT DURING WHAT THE FUCK @BallerSwagBro9k
[0:41:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat Oh and Shadow Broker I forgot loo
[0:41:41] <+trackles_64> i thought we were doing this next week

[0:41:57] <peachy996> ME3 is sadness in Space
[0:41:59] <+Deebo305> Do Arrival LAST, Overlord can be done whenever, Shadow Broker can be done whenever but is better post game. Do Kasumi and Zaeed along with rest of loyalty missions
[0:42:02] <Profmcstevie> Gief lacks the movement for a 720
[0:42:02] <%Monkeyweed21> TELL ME ABOUT THE SHEPHARD GRANDPA
[0:42:04] <+InternetShis> Let's watch Metroid Effect 2!
[0:42:07] <%Pappajimbo> paige would be that Irish guy that survived all the poison attemps for the insurance and had to have a tube hooked upto the gas main shuved in his mouth to do it
[0:42:16] <LudoJax> Just finished 2, having never played those end game DLC's, it definitely improved even the beginning 20 minutes of ME3 for me
[0:42:23] <peachy996> SHUT UP CHILD. NO STORIES ABOUT THE SHEPHERD TODAY
[0:42:24] <%shadowsofpain> Oh yeah I guess shadowbroker is better post game
[0:42:25] <+trackles_64> I love ME3. people just jump on the hate train
[0:42:26] <%chance_h> All that matters is that you try to simp for Jack

[0:42:36] <knight_verse> Oh, so Pat lied about no ME2 this week... I see...
[0:42:46] <DatAsuna> Zaeed deserved better

[0:46:05] <+trackles_64> Who is paiges love interest in mass effect?
[0:46:07] <+InternetShis> @deebo305 Not drunk enough to relive Overlord
[0:46:08] <%aWanderingKaivo> oh ME2 already, I thought that was planned for later
[0:46:08] <%shadowsofpain> oh yeah put Jacob is the trash as fast as possible
[0:46:10] <$RealThiele> and the gout
[0:46:10] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt there's dialogue for characters at points where its an impossibility characters should react when they're not even supposed to be there
[0:46:11] <%coward_man> EAT YOUR CEREAL GOO!
[0:46:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> You realize you can get Zaeed on the way to getting Garrus right?
[0:46:11] <$yeknomlive> yeah you can bring legion to tali's loyalty
[0:46:13] <%ArchimerCXV> there's flags for dialogue even where the events of companions present would be impossible, just to cover their bases with scripting scenes changing places
[0:46:13] <%sunsetdisc0> @patstaresat  bro you need to start thinking about kindergarten you're gonna enroll grunt in
[0:46:15] <%pokefan9956> is pat fringe class?
[0:46:16] <Srthunda> garbage disposals arent even for rich people

[0:46:21] <MasterTonberry23> j
[0:46:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> Grunt's unique dialogue isn't worth waiting on getting Garrus.
[0:46:27] <James_Quivers> Just chew the food before putting it down the drain, bootleg garbage disposal
[0:46:29] <RubberFistFight> Paige, Pat constantly makes fun of Plague for living on a farm. Do you really think he WOULDN'T make fun of you for exactly the same reason?
[0:46:30] <ape_hawk> its a good thing pat is doing the "different squad for every mission" route because he gets to get the worst squad member combo out of the way right in the beginning
[0:46:30] <knight_verse> Smart people get Mordon before they go get Garrus.

[0:57:50] <mak0t0yukii> YES
[0:57:50] <alroy900> dedication, I can respect that
[0:57:51] <HaroldDonchee> "this isn't about you. this is about me"
[0:57:52] <%Mr_Pylon> they probably gave him a big honking robodick
[0:57:52] <+trackles_64> he was unconcious
[0:57:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt I think Miranda said it.
[0:57:53] <%MidnightBurst12> yes
[0:57:53] <$KetsuoTaberu> yup
[0:57:54] <signofzeta> 100%, shep said that
[0:57:54] <%zyberion626> "Miranda...THE BIGGEST DICK..."
[0:57:55] <%Mekhet09> Guy's don't want a big penis for women. They want it to say they have a big penis.
[0:57:55] <+gespenst25> No, but FemShep did
[0:57:56] <%vexion_smh> Pat and the Humongus Cock
[0:57:57] <LudoJax> 'dont bring me back unless my cock is HUGE brother'
[0:57:58] <%JoshManVGH> That's what he woke up for
[0:57:58] <thelonechris> We're already at ME2?
[0:57:58] <bob900000> what about femshep
[0:57:59] <+AmericanSkidd> Any playthrough of any Fenoxo game would be enlightening
[0:58:00] <%DashXero> Nah. He requested a huge robo dick.
[0:58:00] <%dekkitout> "And color code them for Tali and Larry!"
[0:58:00] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Pat that’s a problem LUL
[0:58:01] <%aWanderingKaivo> then you get a robo arm AND a huge dick, win win
[0:58:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> I think Miranda told them to give Shep a giant dick.
[0:58:04] <%derpy_platypus> Cerberus why didn't you make me hung like a horse?
[0:58:04] <%MidnightBurst12> only paragon shepard

[0:58:16] <%DorianCreed> And then Shephjerd finds out the average size for a Quarian male is like 2 inches
[0:58:16] <zerointelligence000> "We'll bang ok? with my massive dick"

[0:58:35] <%justnathan18> Not banging Miranda should be a crime. Its LITERALLY what shes there for.
[0:58:36] <@SSaryn> Dead. I wonder why.
[0:58:37] <%Wallabri> elmo looks so small now compared to having gief on camera
[0:58:37] <+gregpivo> Miranda's like "I see I'm not the only genetically perfect specimen here."
[0:58:38] <+jerkhov> this menu was always so trash

[0:58:54] <%Ravioli_Ronin> I miss ME1’s synth soundtrack but goddamn the suicide mission theme goes hard
[0:58:54] <+InternetShis> Miranda wanted it to be exact, so would TIM push for a skin transplant?
[0:58:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GONE REDUCED TO ATOMS
[0:58:55] <+jerkhov> Miranda is made for SFM not romancing
[0:58:56] <Too_Much_Nukie> Miranda was literally put on the ship for Shepard's dick by the Illusive Man.
[0:58:58] <Too_Much_Nukie> That's canon.
[0:59:01] <iosephe> Yes
[0:59:03] <NitronStreams> WTF

[0:59:17] <+trackles_64> they ruin immersion
[0:59:22] <@SSaryn> I wanna kill every single person who thinks that's a good idea, to make Subtitles OFF by default.
[0:59:24] <Broken_Sonex> @jerkhov_ Also any girl in Overwatch

[0:59:32] <%Dfreddy8> HARDCORE
[0:59:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Why is it red
[0:59:38] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pat Shepard never reached lvl 60 so you won't get as much starting xp.
[0:59:38] <NitronStreams> This is a dialogue heavy game
[0:59:40] <+burntbagels13> insanity after last game

[1:02:58] <TioXyco> elusive man can choke
[1:02:58] <peachy996> He's only cool in this sadly
[1:02:58] <%HitchhikingThrough> Isn't he kind of a dumbass though
[1:03:00] <%Wallabri> Shepard's a Primal

[1:03:06] <%AncelDeLambert> they ruin him HARD in 3
[1:03:06] <DatAsuna> It sure would be lame if they had no plan for him and were making it up as they went between games
[1:03:06] <+Daigrey> Martin FUCKING Sheen!
[1:03:07] <+AmericanSkidd> What a cool asshole

[1:03:08] <%bassoontyphoon> If this was a David Cage game , the illusive man would be fat
[1:03:08] <peachy996> He gets so much more uncool in 3
[1:03:09] <+sermittens> Martin Sheen is great
[1:03:09] <$realm_forge> This the room where Martin sheen gives you your persona powers
[1:03:11] <GustauveVIII> his name is tim
[1:03:13] <Broken_Sonex> He's SUCH a dicl
[1:03:15] <%watts121> Basically the Empire Strikes Back of Mass Effect trilogy.

[1:03:23] <Pookiedaexzile> The Best Spacist
[1:03:23] <%GarbageNirvana> I always thought it was odd they had Martin Sheen voice him when he looks so much more like Kirk Douglas
[1:03:24] <%RubberFistFight> @TourettesPlays NORMALISE AUSTRALIAN ACCENTS IN VIDEO GAMES just so we've got something to poke fun at. Welsh accents too, same reason./
[1:03:25] <Ipsenscastle> The Illusive Man is super cool and also a complete fucking dumbass
[1:03:25] <+jerkhov> I sure hope nothing bad happens to it
[1:03:25] <%FierceDeityGabe> I hope nothing happens to it
[1:03:27] <xcompleasedad> But it ain't no SR3, tho
[1:03:27] <%zyberion626> Nothing bad will ever happen to the Normandy!
[1:03:27] <+gregpivo> After people started calling him TIM he got ruined
[1:03:27] <Zalapski> used7
[1:03:28] <%Mekhet09> Does anyone else get ruined in three as much as the elusive man?
[1:03:29] <%VioletHeart> I sure do love the Normandy SR1. I hope nothing bad happens to it!

[1:04:53] <thelonechris> That scream LUL
[1:04:56] <+jerkhov> stock scream
[1:04:56] <hazel_gem> the Collector ship being made of rock is actually a bit cool

[1:05:00] <%JoshManVGH> No not Wilhelm!
[1:05:00] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I've notice a bunch of dialogue missing in the beginning. Miranda doesn't tell TIM about Shep saving the Council or not. And when they plays 20 Questions with ya on a shuttle there's no mention about who you made Councilor or anything
[1:05:00] <SaltyAzteca> SCREAM.MP4
[1:05:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> Oh hey Liara is wearing the heavy armor now.
[1:05:02] <Zalapski> i managed to avoid all trailers/spoilers for this game, so this was awesome on first play
[1:05:03] <peachy996> ew she's wearing ash armor
[1:05:03] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt It was the non-wilhelm stock scream
[1:05:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> That's weird.
[1:05:04] <JetpackMcQuack> there's still time
[1:05:05] <+jerkhov> at least it wasn't wilhelm
[1:05:05] <+trackles_64> arghhhhhh
[1:05:06] <NitronStreams> OH NO THEY GOT WILHELM
[1:05:06] <+Nomad_Scholar> Common Wilhem scream
[1:05:09] <spawnzie> ready for lunch?
[1:05:13] <katzroy56> how many times must wilhelm die?
[1:05:14] <%Ravioli_Ronin> LUL LUL LUL
[1:05:15] <Hellarussian> you're too close man

[1:05:21] <%MidnightBurst12> gotta love that flying asteroid look on their ship
[1:05:26] <%RubberFistFight> @NitronStreams that was not the wilhelm scream
[1:05:27] <TheAntiNihilist> Very dramatic pause
[1:05:28] <%AncelDeLambert> it's a HUGE glowup
[1:05:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> It did at the time too.
[1:05:29] <+trackles_64> Well it is on a new engine
[1:05:30] <%AzureGale> JOKER WHY
[1:05:30] <%Lizard0TM> no shit Pat
[1:05:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> sure does
[1:05:36] <%JamesCorck> The leap from ME1 to ME2 is astronomic.
[1:05:36] <$LightningLynx89> There's no time!
[1:05:36] <Profmcstevie> MONEY went into this game
[1:05:36] <peachy996> Leave her to die
[1:05:37] <Ipsenscastle> It's such a shocking jump in polish
[1:05:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> @derpy_platypus You can't change your gender between games.
[1:05:42] <%pokefan9956> is it actually possible to switch to femshep lol
[1:05:44] <spawnzie> ya horny broad
[1:05:45] <%justnathan18> Why is Liara the only Squad Mate here?
[1:05:47] <@SSaryn> I'll take care of Persona 5 Joker Kappa
[1:05:49] <TourettesPlays> ME1 had a few kino shots but 2 is like entirely Kino shots its insane
[1:05:50] <ape_hawk> "theres no time, one-night-stand!"
[1:05:51] <Hellarussian> if only Ashley were here

[1:05:58] <BlueLunecy> Something about that helmet is really cool
[1:05:59] <peachy996> Shouldn't Kaiden be here?
[1:05:59] <JetpackMcQuack> Joker would fall over without me
[1:06:02] <%zyberion626> I'm kinda surprised no one was furious with Joker
[1:06:03] <%AzureGale> Gotta save Xander Mobus
[1:06:04] <+athuramn> @pokefan9956 that would be wild
[1:06:06] <%twistedj3ster> Leave Joker to me

[1:06:29] <peachy996> ah theme of Collectors
[1:06:34] <%heartlesshealer> suddenly every armor has masks
[1:06:35] <%LumberjackJack> Oof, that's a bad sight D:
[1:06:38] <%Lizard0TM> Pat romanced Liara in ME1 yeah? That's why she's here and not Kaiden
[1:06:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> So why does the ship not destroy the escape pods? LUL
[1:06:44] <Ipsenscastle> Where even were those escape pods accessible from?
[1:06:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> Everything is going great!
[1:06:45] <%aWanderingKaivo> its fiiine
[1:06:45] <%twistedj3ster> it's a great opening
[1:06:45] <%AncelDeLambert> it's about to look gooder

[1:09:40] <TioXyco> so long gay bowser
[1:09:40] <%JoshManVGH> Like... shit
[1:09:40] <xcompleasedad> Is Shepard the only person in Mass Effect to come back from the dead? I forget if they tried on someone else or not
[1:09:41] <%wibbwobbler> Ahh so cool
[1:09:41] <peachy996> How do you even get dna off that
[1:09:41] <%DorianCreed> Blood boiling out of your eyes due to pressure differentials
[1:09:42] <%ScottishMadJacko> F
[1:09:42] <spawnzie> shepard dies so fucking hard
[1:09:42] <+InternetShis> Re-entry in a military space suit would be excruciating
[1:09:43] <@SSaryn> It's kind of incredible he isn't fucking like, traumatized by the fact he's FALLING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.
[1:09:44] <%RubberFistFight> how the hell did Cerberus manage to resurrect a literal chill-charred lump of meat?
[1:09:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> YUP
[1:09:44] <DatAsuna> It's over
[1:09:44] <%AzureGale> LATE TITLE CARD
[1:09:45] <mak0t0yukii> GG pat beaten the game got the bad end
[1:09:45] <+Nomad_Scholar> Can you imagine the PTSD after coming back from that?
[1:09:49] <HaroldDonchee> I remember this kinda pissed me off when I was younger
[1:09:49] <+MightyDuckShoes> They jinxed it
[1:09:50] <TomFrancis_> its ok its the main character
[1:09:50] <%HanbaobaoZaiNar> pat shepard spams barrier the whole way down
[1:09:50] <AllenDeadman> they just HAD that conversation
[1:09:50] <%heartlesshealer> oh god depressurized suit
[1:09:51] <peachy996> Wouldn't it burn up on entry
[1:09:51] <ape_hawk> "Now youre in Racist Heaven with Ashley"
[1:09:51] <%pokefan9956> so is this like a ship of theseus thing and the original shep is actually gone?
[1:09:51] <+gregpivo> Suffocated, burned up on re-entry and splattered into jelly on the planet's surface
[1:09:51] <%DashXero> Depressurized and fried to a crisp in an atmosphere. Yeah. Bad way to go.
[1:09:52] <+smuggleruncle> RIP time to play as a clone
[1:09:52] <TourettesPlays> yes
[1:09:52] <+InternetShis> YEAH
[1:09:52] <wasteless40800> now that's how you start a videogame
[1:09:53] <ioci2112> so how did cerberus revive shepard exactly, he got shot out into space, and burned up in the atmosphere
[1:09:53] <AllenDeadman> and shepard died
[1:09:54] <%Dfreddy8> NO
[1:09:54] <%shadowsofpain> Thus is the most fucked up way to go
[1:09:54] <chronoxgp> no
[1:09:55] <%zyberion626> NO SKIP THE BAD COMIC
[1:09:55] <@SSaryn> Oh

[1:10:01] <niko_fredman> NO
[1:10:02] <SaltyAzteca> uhhhhh
[1:10:03] <Meekest> No
[1:10:03] <%AncelDeLambert> noooo
[1:10:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> Genesis was PS3 only originally.
[1:10:04] <dd44dostivei> NO
[1:10:04] <IndoorSitup> NO
[1:10:05] <%dekkitout> How many sci fi game mc's did this? Shep, Chief, Prophet, who else?
[1:10:06] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, no
[1:10:06] <%DorianCreed> No
[1:10:06] <Ipsenscastle> LUL
[1:10:07] <%Robot_Nixon_> No KEKW
[1:10:08] <TomFrancis_> YES
[1:10:08] <%democrazyyy> aw its nice though
[1:10:08] <%AzureGale> Good
[1:10:08] <%solracc25> dead on re-entry
[1:10:09] <buhbuhboat> yeh
[1:10:09] <%zyberion626> good the comic looks horrible
[1:10:09] <%Varlinator> DO IT! IT'S REALLY DUMB!
[1:10:09] <Jmann1892> NO
[1:10:10] <+MelodyMedley> No
[1:10:11] <%DorianCreed> It's just the ME1 plot
[1:10:12] <@SSaryn> Interesting. Good idea to include that though.
[1:10:13] <+gregpivo> This is from the PS3, from when ME1 deidn
[1:10:14] <%RubberFistFight> @SSaryn probably more distracted by the boiling of all the water in his lungs.
[1:10:14] <%ingman112> NO
[1:10:15] <%CalderGaming> look at this PAT FLESH
[1:10:15] <%Robot_Nixon_> Fem shep time :)
[1:10:15] <buhbuhboat> cringe
[1:10:15] <+gregpivo> Didn't exist
[1:10:15] <%MrBorisMakarov> love this scene so much
[1:10:16] <Blank9> @SSaryn Shepard is legitimately too stupid somehow to have an existential crisis.
[1:10:18] <+jerkhov> its not a good motion comic, just was for making choices because PS3 had no 1
[1:10:19] <TourettesPlays> Dark Horse Comics ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:10:21] <+Mrkel90> How is there anything left of shepard after this
[1:10:21] <%AzureGale> Yeha it was
[1:10:23] <%JamesCorck> Yeah that was it.
[1:10:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Genesis is there for people who never played 1.
[1:10:27] <%RubberFistFight> HOWWWW DO THEY MANAGE THIS
[1:10:28] <peachy996> OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS CUSTOM THEME
[1:10:29] <jorniev> I STILL think its one of the most straight up crazy intro for a game character in any game
[1:10:30] <%snow_bush> So here is a question. How did he survive re-entry?
[1:10:30] <%LumberjackJack> We Deus Ex now, boi
[1:10:32] <+trackles_64> Should have been paste
[1:10:32] <+AmericanSkidd> WAY too much
[1:10:32] <iosephe> yup
[1:10:33] <%shadowsofpain> sure
[1:10:33] <%democrazyyy> was good armor man
[1:10:34] <+InternetShis> Oh hey the audio doesn't get cut off
[1:10:34] <%Konquerer> you're all kinds of fucked up
[1:10:34] <thelonechris> Time to put some miracle tech in him
[1:10:37] <%Arancet> it was a really good space suit
[1:10:38] <%dave323dave> they had 2 years. THey could probably regrow a bunch of him
[1:10:38] <Pookiedaexzile> And Rotting
[1:10:39] <%heartlesshealer> bye comic 👋
[1:10:39] <%aWanderingKaivo> the mass effect saved him
[1:10:40] <blue8moon> it's a really good suit okay
[1:10:41] <+Mrkel90> he should be warm Goop
[1:10:41] <%NCC1701Dave> Good armor i guess
[1:10:42] <Hellarussian> he should be a crisp
[1:10:42] <%MidnightBurst12> he's got cool armor tho
[1:10:42] <xcompleasedad> He was wearing super armor, tho
[1:10:42] <Ipsenscastle> Shepard's body should be obliterated
[1:10:43] <+trackles_64> maybe low gravity
[1:10:43] <%dekkitout> That suit was pretty sturdy I guess
[1:10:43] <$SGrim> Powerful future technology viod suit
[1:10:43] <+VvTacoSaladvV> "Your decisions will carry over to the next game" ME2 opening "your character is dead af"
[1:10:44] <+FoolsArcade> the suit protects Shepherd don't think abou tit
[1:10:44] <stantheman_97> his cells should be complete ash
[1:10:44] <+jerkhov> this cutscene is so sick
[1:10:45] <%aWanderingKaivo> don't worry about it
[1:10:45] <%maenos2> This whole opening, just because "whoops we can't transfer your shepard over right"
[1:10:45] <HiggsV> Most unbelievably thing about this series, THIS SHIT
[1:10:46] <+TehPostman> he has armor
[1:10:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> There's a comic where Liara retrieves Shepard's body.
[1:10:47] <dd44dostivei> idunno the suit and all
[1:10:47] <%Mekhet09> If he was in full body armor I could believe that.
[1:10:47] <notsoy> NANOMACHINES SON
[1:10:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HES THE CHOSEN ON PAT
[1:10:48] <tanarath> @patstaresat barrier
[1:10:48] <%Urgotfantasy> There should be like TEETH and thats IT
[1:10:49] <Broken_Sonex> PLOT ARMOUR EVEN IN DEATH
[1:10:49] <%Lizard0TM> Remember Citadel DLC in 3?
[1:10:49] <%chance_h> space magic OP
[1:10:49] <signofzeta> he would've been a fucking smear on the ground
[1:10:50] <GustauveVIII> now the question is, is shepard sterile?
[1:10:50] <BeastlyWhale> ME2 is all about that kind of writing
[1:10:50] <Ids560> yeah fuckin reentry? there'd be about enough to fill a thimble if you were made entirely of rock
[1:10:50] <+Buzzkill983> Become as God
[1:10:52] <alextrebeken> A LOT OF OMNI GEL
[1:10:53] <%Mekhet09> Yeah.
[1:10:53] <Profmcstevie> A limp body can sustain a lot of damage Pat
[1:10:53] <+MightyDuckShoes> Should he be like Robocop? Have a scene where he takes off the suit and he's mostly machines?
[1:10:54] <JetpackMcQuack> He's no John Halo
[1:10:55] <@SSaryn> Little bit.
[1:10:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yes you're robocop.
[1:10:55] <%democrazyyy> there basically was nothing, jacob describes you as meat and tubes i believe
[1:10:56] <+InternetShis> You are a cyborg
[1:10:56] <GizmoKSX> Murphy, it's you!
[1:10:57] <QuestlordJake> roboshep
[1:10:57] <%coward_man> @snow_bush  he didnt
[1:10:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> In 2 and 3.
[1:10:58] <jorniev> APARENTLY M1 ARMOR ARE REALLY GOOD
[1:10:58] <%dekkitout> HE'S A WHOLE ASS CYBORG
[1:10:58] <$Kaiser_Loar> the 5th element him
[1:10:58] <%snow_bush> I hate this
[1:10:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Yup
[1:10:59] <buhbuhboat> Yeah this whole thing makes no fuckin sense
[1:10:59] <+D00msDayDan> the million dollar shepard
[1:10:59] <%Ranryu692> "We can rebuild him"
[1:10:59] <%JoshManVGH> I wonder if they took the Spartan Lock concept from Halo 3
[1:11:00] <%Ravioli_Ronin> That’s a good space suit
[1:11:00] <%MidnightBurst12> 100%
[1:11:00] <$SGrim> and 3
[1:11:00] <+MightyDuckShoes> Well shit
[1:11:00] <%Wallabri> space magic
[1:11:00] <%MrBorisMakarov> IS SHEPHERD A MOLDED
[1:11:01] <stantheman_97> oh shit yeah basically
[1:11:01] <hamborgini> space robo snitch
[1:11:02] <+StoopKid241> Just give him a bit of DIO blood and Shepard will be fine!
[1:11:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Deus Ex BABY
[1:11:02] <%Lizard0TM> Clones
[1:11:03] <%solracc25> He should be ashes
[1:11:03] <+ratchetex> time for the jesus metaphor to go all the way
[1:11:04] <cellaccount> but what if there is no attmoustfear
[1:11:05] <Chaos_Aether> Suit preserved that much maybe
[1:11:06] <%NCC1701Dave> That's why targeting is better
[1:11:07] <%Ranryu692> he's the 6 Million Dollar Man
[1:11:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> Shepard being partially synthetic is part of the plot of 3 Pat.
[1:11:08] <Blank9> you're robocop but you don't even care, shepard just ignores it like it never happened
[1:11:09] <+MelodyMedley> Major robocop
[1:11:09] <+Nomad_Scholar> The excuse is that it's a low atmosphere planet
[1:11:09] <TomFrancis_> give your shepard hair this time
[1:11:10] <%Mekhet09> this is pretty much Deus EX levels.
[1:11:10] <%coreyyotto> SpaceCop
[1:11:11] <+D00msDayDan> we can rebuild him, we have the technology
[1:11:11] <%Jeemukun> more like the 6 million dollar man
[1:11:11] <thelonechris> "I
[1:11:11] <%hrbeck_> CHECK A LOOK
[1:11:12] <+megaman_sentinel> anybody else remember how violent that first RoboCop movie was
[1:11:12] <+InternetShis> Lotta medi-gel, LOTTA omni-gel
[1:11:12] <signofzeta> THERE HE IS
[1:11:13] <T_Sasquatch> not like it fucking matters
[1:11:13] <%justnathan18> @PatStaresAt Are you going to use the reconstruction surgery to fix your lines?
[1:11:13] <HiggsV> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE

[1:13:46] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt resurection spells don't work on gingers because of no souls. Resurrection technology circumvents this by making their hair look shitty, thus not ginger.
[1:13:50] <%AncelDeLambert> EGG

[1:24:57] <%twistedj3ster> because he's DEAD
[1:24:57] <jbrachob> they looked out the window and saw a ship with a big ass "NORMANDY" sign on it
[1:24:58] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt look at it this way, at least you get to break Joker's arm ALL OVER AGAIN.
[1:24:58] <%DJFakie> No one has ever meant that, Pat
[1:24:59] <MichelangeloStark> bs science where they have sensors that can identify things that the Normandy didn't know it was giving off
[1:25:00] <%HanbaobaoZaiNar> they saved the good beards for Joker's character model
[1:25:01] <%LeiaSkynoober> Wait is it just me or is the game's lip sync awful
[1:25:05] <Ipsenscastle> I can't believe you're jealous of Pressly
[1:25:06] <+red_cuppa> they said pressly aint a filthy redhead
[1:25:08] <+OmegaFatalis> the only person that wishes they looked like Presly
[1:25:10] <Zeif00> The good looking die sooner
[1:25:12] <%Deebo305> They looked out a window obviously
[1:25:14] <%Robot_Nixon_> lobosKek  👉 lobos1 lobos2
[1:25:16] <%sporeian94> Remember the ME2 teaser where they said Sherpard was KIA and it showed Legion with the N7 chest plate
[1:25:18] <QuestlordJake> beeeeeeeeam
[1:25:20] <%Varlinator> Why could'nt they just add dumb psaBig beards
[1:25:20] <%Lizard0TM> Pat you can skip with X or start dummy
[1:25:24] <Jetsfantasy> Thank god Pat's streaming, I have to stop watching early Strive coverage while I'm a PC pleb NotLikeThis
[1:25:27] <Josef_Stryker> Bye Pressly. Again.
[1:25:28] <+AmericanSkidd> they shooting space honey at you
[1:25:29] <placeholder03> make yourself look like matt walsh
[1:25:29] <%TheWinged7> M O RT I S
[1:25:31] <peachy996> Pressly dies so nice we see it twice
[1:25:36] <%aWanderingKaivo> yeah the star trek effect
[1:25:44] <BigBlueToadSage> They just want to tell the Normandy about their extended warranty
[1:25:44] <SaltyAzteca> SCREAM.MP4 AGAIn
[1:25:45] <+Buzzkill983> AUGH
[1:25:45] <Vantesla> The upgraded Normandy has a different/better stealth system I recall. There was flaws with original Normandy as it was a prototype.
[1:25:46] <+BIumen> why did pat restart again
[1:25:48] <+Shubreaker> DUMPSTER TIME
[1:25:50] <%TheWinged7> They make the panels out of the space CRTs
[1:25:51] <stantheman_97> everything explodes at random in space
[1:25:51] <Ipsenscastle> all display panels are rigged with explosives
[1:25:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Imagine if Cars did that
[1:25:54] <peachy996> Liara looks TERRIBLE in Phoenix Armor
[1:25:54] <%bread_assassin> I missed it. Why did Pat restart?
[1:26:00] <%RubberFistFight> It's coz of the EPS grid in Star Trek. For whatever reason they decided just piping superhot explosive warp plasma all over the ship without converting it or anything.
[1:26:00] <%capnbeefs> I love the collector ships, any kind of organic ship is cool.
[1:26:00] <%sporeian94> No he's prepping the SOS siignal from that station
[1:26:01] <blackbaron98> getting big naps
[1:26:03] <Latija> he's calibrating
[1:26:05] <%Lizard0TM> He's at the computer Pat
[1:26:05] <%zyberion626> @PatStaresAt He has his own bed tho
[1:26:05] <+AmericanSkidd> its not wilhelm, its wilhelm's cousin
[1:26:08] <%ArCielArDor> How many ships have blown up so far?
[1:26:08] <%Varlinator> Is that a royalty free scream
[1:26:08] <+ThomasOfTroy> Shepard has his own quatrers
[1:26:09] <%Ravioli_Ronin> It’s insane that any self respecting sound designer uses fucking stock screams
[1:26:09] <%Lizard0TM> Shepard has a room
[1:26:10] <NitronStreams> RIP Ensign Not-Wilhelm
[1:26:11] <$KetsuoTaberu> @bread_assassin bad hair day
[1:26:13] <%bread_assassin> Why would he sleep in the pods. He has his own room.
[1:26:18] <MagmaRam> Normandy's stealth system would only work against passive detection, not against regular radar or lidar, right?
[1:26:20] <seancbo> I remember watching this cutscene like 8 fucking times trying to get the look of my character right LUL
[1:26:22] <LluthyY> as he should

[1:26:28] <%LumberjackJack> Wouldn't you, tho?
[1:26:29] <%Robot_Nixon_> @bread_assassin that room is for bangin only
[1:26:29] <%TheWinged7> shepard
[1:26:30] <DatAsuna> It's actually dumb that the collectors couldn't catch the shuttles/pods either
[1:26:32] <$Faustgesicht> Huh I've never seen Liara in this part
[1:26:32] <Vantesla> Joker practically got Shepard killed ironmouseKEK
[1:26:35] <nuane> now!
[1:26:35] <%justnathan18> How long after 1 is this whole mess?
[1:26:40] <%RubberFistFight> @MagmaRam i think that's actually a plot point in this,m you need to upgrade it iirc
[1:26:45] <%DianaTheAscian> its so much better
[1:26:45] <MichelangeloStark> batman always says that but he never takes care of Joker
[1:26:45] <Ipsenscastle> Liara's ass light is kinda silly
[1:26:48] <PirateMike_> JOKER DID NOTHING WRONG

[1:27:07] <+JaseAdrift> 2 years of the council doin nothing
[1:27:07] <Dragovus> 6 Week then 2 years
[1:27:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Blade 2 of the series, Ruins the universe Mythology but is waaaaaaaaay better
[1:27:10] <%Arweynn> its 3 or 6 months after the citadel, it's metioned somewhere
[1:27:11] <CyberTheory> me 3 is years after 1
[1:27:13] <zerointelligence000> Do they ever address the fact that Cerberus have a cure for death?
[1:27:13] <LudoJax> then 6 months until ME3
[1:27:14] <Grandnatics> Getting PUNKED after saving the Citadel
[1:27:16] <blackbaron98> Shepard cannot catch a break
[1:27:20] <%Piemen99> Who are the bad guys in this game?
[1:27:24] <Vantesla> I think Jacob gives exact details to even days and hours...
[1:27:28] <aiutare47> The breather helmet is one of the coolest thing and one of my favorite armor designs
[1:27:30] <%Lizard0TM> Collectors
[1:27:33] <CyberTheory> me3 is  3 years after 1
[1:27:33] <%RubberFistFight> @justnathan18 he doesn't just die, he dies, then freezes, then BURNS. It's like when you leave a steak in the freezer too long and then overcook it.
[1:27:33] <Coystick> Dejua Vu rn smh
[1:27:35] <%Deft_Thought> See, if they didn't spend all that money on the Normandy, they coulda bought a bunch of war frigates like that one Admiral said in the first game!
[1:27:39] <%zyberion626> @Arweynn the intro text literally said it was one month after the citadel
[1:27:39] <+athuramn> lol this chat is getting progressively more wrong about the timeline
[1:27:41] <peachy996> @zerointelligence000 they go on and on about how expensive it was
[1:27:42] <huskarl_zap> Seth Green as The Joker TM
[1:27:45] <%HitchhikingThrough> Why does legendary edition not just have your character continue
[1:27:47] <%MrBorisMakarov> the ship is tainted with Ashley it must be purged
[1:27:50] <Broken_Sonex> So yeah plot armour keeps Shepard's body from falling apart even after death
[1:27:50] <%dekkitout> Cool~
[1:27:54] <Vantesla> @piemen99 Collectors a alien race not well known that serve Reapers
[1:27:54] <%TheWinged7> explerience
[1:27:55] <%DianaTheAscian> it is cool
[1:27:55] <HiggsV> Hall Wuggin time
[1:27:57] <PirateMike_> fuck with the flying chair
[1:27:57] <nuane> "hold together"
[1:27:57] <%HitchhikingThrough> like why does it have to hide their face
[1:27:57] <+AmericanSkidd> @Deft_Thought but leather seats tho
[1:27:59] <%Ranryu692> I think I prefer SR 1 exterior, SR 2 interior
[1:27:59] <HotMafia81> Explerience
[1:28:00] <+leontalon> play with the chairs
[1:28:01] <+trackles_64> @aiutare47  ive always hated the non symmetrical sohulder pads tho
[1:28:03] <%Varlinator> Take a photo Pat
[1:28:03] <NitronStreams> SPAAAAAAACE...again!
[1:28:09] <%Robot_Nixon_> now fart :)
[1:28:10] <seancbo> I like the part where youre about to rescue him and he goes "I'm the jokester baby!". Just wait, its coming up
[1:28:10] <Grandnatics> BONK
[1:28:13] <+Gamingand808s> they created a whole amazing game for one plotpoint: shepard is a robot now lol
[1:28:13] <%twistedj3ster> can we just keep restarting and blow up the Normandy all stream?
[1:28:14] <SpaceGuntank> i like normandy 1 more than the 2, even though its way cooler it just takes forever to get around with how big they made it
[1:28:17] <%justnathan18> Fucking space selfie
[1:28:19] <mar_krow> joker should be able to be treated right
[1:28:24] <CyberTheory> issac clarke has been real quiet since shepard did a space walk
[1:28:28] <%RubberFistFight> My guess is the body didn't fall all the way through the atmosphere, it just entered a low orbit, and the suit offered some protection from the friction burn. Coz otherwise Shepard would not be coming back no matter how much space cum and tiny robuts you injected into him.
[1:28:33] <%HitchhikingThrough> Not here obviously but like in general, seems like it could be possible to implement
[1:28:36] <+trackles_64> Jokers helmet isnt compltetly seaaled
[1:28:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> Joker thought he was being such a badass
[1:28:37] <Pookiedaexzile> SR2 interior is more over done than a Pimp my ride Car, one felt military 2 feels lavish
[1:28:38] <+Buzzkill983> Shepherd: Hurry, I am speedrunning crashing into this planet to change my beard
[1:28:43] <%sporeian94> Fun fact the original intro after this sequence was Legion landing at the normandy crash site, searching the wreckage for Shepard, and just finding his chest plate
[1:28:45] <Profmcstevie> Shepard I'm gonna be dumb "no wait don't" yeah okay
[1:28:46] <%HitchhikingThrough> oh that's why, that's a prerendered scene
[1:28:49] <%Ravioli_Ronin> It’s wild they wasted all this money resurrecting Shep when they’ve got cloning tech
[1:28:50] <hippofant> Has anybody considered that maybe Joker just needed help due to his disability, and everybody just left him to die in the cockpit except Shepard?
[1:28:51] <peachy996> Guys remember how stupid Mordin, Samara and the Humans look in Space?
[1:28:51] <%Robot_Nixon_> @RubberFistFight but what if its a lot of space cum
[1:28:52] <+AmericanSkidd> not the space bees and their space honey lasers
[1:28:53] <MagmaRam> @RubberFistFight they might be able to fit radar absorbing material or some other thing to reduce RCS, but LIDAR works in the visible spectrum, isn't that still an issue? And obviously they can't fix the shape, though hopefully they were thinking about that when they designed the stealth ship.
[1:28:58] <HaroldDonchee> man joker would be a complete mess after this. physically I mean
[1:29:00] <Parapattern> Shut up, Seth Green!
[1:29:04] <%zyberion626> that's the point
[1:29:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah that's very intentional.
[1:29:06] <QuestlordJake> a repeating nightmare NotLikeThis
[1:29:06] <DatAsuna> the SR3 is my favourite version of the normandy
[1:29:07] <Taco_Salsaguy> geez Shepard! thanks for saving but watch the arm!
[1:29:09] <peachy996> They don't have full helmets
[1:29:12] <Ipsenscastle> private sector, dude
[1:29:14] <%aWanderingKaivo> what if cerberus shepard is just a clone though
[1:29:14] <%RubberFistFight> @Robot_Nixon_ "He's more space cum now, than man. Twisted and evil."
[1:29:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> And then in 3 it's a gutted luxury ship that's turned into a military vessel.
[1:29:24] <%dekkitout> Lore 🌈
[1:29:25] <%AFellowDegen> Hello!
[1:29:25] <+trackles_64> Leather seats
[1:29:31] <%Arweynn> Also no Turian influence
[1:29:32] <Blank9> and it's not trying to copy turian command structures
[1:29:34] <James_Quivers> SR2 in ME3 is peak military, it's ramshackle as fuck
[1:29:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> @aWanderingKaivo Then I guess he's a clone.
[1:29:38] <%justnathan18> You know how in Army of 2 they have golden bodyarmor and shit? Military contractors. More money.
[1:29:39] <+trackles_64> F
[1:29:39] <MagmaRam> rip
[1:29:39] <%capnbeefs> Always devastating to watch
[1:29:39] <Vantesla> Ya Illusive Man literally made it to be comfortable for crew. Joker makes a comment on the comfy seats LUL
[1:29:41] <%Deadpal> rip shepeerd
[1:29:42] <SpaceGuntank> they even state that that SR1 had a lot of Turian influence. SR2 was built for both form and function
[1:29:43] <blackbaron98> this is lowkey nightmareish
[1:29:43] <%aWanderingKaivo> jeez you're bad at this
[1:29:43] <Grandnatics> Should have had omni gel
[1:29:44] <BigBlueToadSage> All our tax dollars were wasted building the Normandy
[1:29:44] <%sporeian94> 3 turned it into a mobile command center for admiral hacklett/anderson
[1:29:46] <alextrebeken> at least you pass out first?
[1:29:46] <+JaseAdrift> Very dead
[1:29:47] <%MrBorisMakarov> f
[1:29:48] <SaltyAzteca> Lazarus this man
[1:29:50] <snivins> i hope miranda doesnt fuck up cloning this time LUL
[1:29:52] <%dekkitout> Asphyxiated AND reentry- brutal
[1:29:52] <+JaseAdrift> INCREDIBLY DEAD
[1:29:53] <PirateMike_> Unskippable cutscenes, everyones favorite!
[1:29:53] <+D00msDayDan> pat fucked up and got killed again
[1:29:53] <Essixian> hryCri
[1:29:54] <+Mrkel90> man if dying via lack of oxygen was enough
[1:29:55] <%JamesCorck> Pat's managed to die twice without having even fired a shot yet.
[1:29:55] <%MidnightBurst12> still pretty rough to watch
[1:29:55] <TourettesPlays> @Too_Much_Nukie That stupid big ass cargo bay always pissed me off, guess they needed all that empty space for Vega's dumbells
[1:29:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> LEATHER SEATS COMMANDER
[1:29:57] <%psidefx> F
[1:29:57] <%TheWinged7> shepard, why did you vent your suit
[1:29:58] <%LumberjackJack> F
[1:29:58] <Zalapski> used7 used7
[1:29:58] <%Deadpal> yes
[1:29:58] <@SSaryn> Good job killing Shepard twice ONE GUY.
[1:29:59] <peachy996> I don't like the ME3 version of the Normandy. I get what they were going for but I still dont like it
[1:29:59] <%NCC1701Dave> yes
[1:30:00] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah
[1:30:00] <%Robot_Nixon_> @RubberFistFight and then he banged all the space waifus lobosKek
[1:30:00] <Zeif00> Easy Mode Now Available
[1:30:00] <%Deft_Thought> *Theme of sad piano*
[1:30:01] <@SSaryn> Also yes.
[1:30:01] <SaltyAzteca> I can hear it
[1:30:01] <Taco_Salsaguy> thanks joker.... again
[1:30:02] <+dante_must_die_exe> shepard would just pop inside that suit when he decompressed
[1:30:02] <+Buzzkill983> Now it does
[1:30:03] <TioXyco> no
[1:30:03] <%flechet> ye
[1:30:03] <+fetrigon> scary as fuck
[1:30:03] <%zyberion626> oh wow. It kinda does
[1:30:04] <+captainplanet88> game over
[1:30:04] <+LionKagura> yes
[1:30:05] <tattleworm> lil bit
[1:30:05] <+DappercatEsquire> it's okay, he gets better
[1:30:05] <seancbo> Do you think they talked about changing shepards dick size when they brought him back? Somebody was like cmon, the hero of the galaxy should have at least a 10 incher
[1:30:06] <%RubberFistFight> @aWanderingKaivo I kinda liked that idea but i also like the way it gets deconstructed in 3, and how it shows a clone simply wouldn't have worked, it was either OG!Shep or bust.
[1:30:06] <logothete2401> You literally burn up in orbit
[1:30:07] <jorniev> fuck
[1:30:08] <Vantesla> kinda now ya mentioned ironmouseKEK
[1:30:09] <Dragovus> You fell from space and landed right on your keys
[1:30:09] <Zalapski> third birthday hype
[1:30:10] <%Deadpal> But bioware wasn't thinking about it when they were making this.
[1:30:10] <stormhawk9891> MITOCHONDRIA!?
[1:30:11] <%justnathan18> Were gonna see that cutscene of Miranda's ass again, at least.
[1:30:12] <Broken_Sonex> You know we could say this is just Shepard having the same nightmare over and over while he's getting rebuilt
[1:30:14] <ThatGuyThere03> yes?
[1:30:14] <Lamokmok> Lol, good point
[1:30:15] <%Deadpal> Because *they didn't play it*
[1:30:17] <+trackles_64> no death run failed
[1:30:17] <DatAsuna> play despacito
[1:30:22] <+trackles_64> low gravity planet
[1:30:22] <Ipsenscastle> don't fuck it up now, Pat
[1:30:23] <%dekkitout> Except his magnum dong
[1:30:23] <%Robot_Nixon_> I think 'sad piano time'
[1:30:24] <%vexion_smh> Shepard die twice
[1:30:24] <mar_krow> man pat died so fast speed run
[1:30:24] <%shadowsofpain> Ok literally just give Shep a shave and that's it
[1:30:25] <tanarath> BARRIER
[1:30:26] <%aWanderingKaivo> @aWanderingKaivo yeah I liked the discussion of the idea in 3
[1:30:26] <CyberTheory> the suit protected him shhhhh
[1:30:26] <SpaceGuntank> the best part about shep being spaced is that when Cerb finds him they legit tell you that all that was left was a "pile of meat"
[1:30:26] <+morton531> If only you could make shepard shorter to be realistic
[1:30:26] <@SSaryn> Either that or N7 armor is a lot better than we thought.
[1:30:27] <%Mr_Pylon> he should be paste
[1:30:27] <blue8moon> it's a good space suit pat, don't worry about it
[1:30:27] <%MugenSandan> Mass Effect 2 for TWO DEAD SHEPARDS
[1:30:28] <Pookiedaexzile> BARRIER
[1:30:28] <Profmcstevie> it's a good suit
[1:30:28] <%AFellowDegen> The armor is just that good
[1:30:28] <%capnbeefs> Gotta say it was always a ballsy move to murder the protag at the start of the game
[1:30:28] <%zyberion626> Miranda: "Make his beard pink, for the shits and giggles."
[1:30:28] <Blank9> it ok shepard doesn't think about his death, he just treats it like he was napping
[1:30:30] <auraofdawn> that seems like a REAL bad way to die
[1:30:30] <hippofant> This could be a low-atmosphere, low-gravity planet.
[1:30:30] <+abrupt_abe> can't skip this either lol
[1:30:30] <%Deadpal> He should be the dorito lord?
[1:30:30] <Coystick> "We saved ONE ball"
[1:30:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> Not even
[1:30:32] <wolfen091> unless no atmosphere
[1:30:32] <James_Quivers> the armor is pretty good tho
[1:30:32] <LudoJax> depends on the atmosphere of the planet
[1:30:32] <PirateMike_> A meteorite wont survive it but shepard does
[1:30:33] <%Monkeyweed21> How big is 2 years worth of Colostomy Bags?
[1:30:33] <JetpackMcQuack> we collected him with a vacuum
[1:30:33] <quipquest1> Diavolol has canonically died like this
[1:30:33] <TourettesPlays> All they need is the brain
[1:30:33] <%sporeian94> His brain was intact which is what truly mattered according to 3
[1:30:35] <Vantesla> The armor "helped"
[1:30:35] <%GinAndRoses> shep is CRISPY
[1:30:35] <LeotheHuntsman> isnt that the point of calling it the Lazarus Project?
[1:30:35] <%ssjklyco> Miranda should get her own game called Ass Effect
[1:30:36] <Grandnatics> How effective are suits?
[1:30:36] <blackbaron98> but his suit though
[1:30:37] <nuane> they reassembled him from the dust
[1:30:38] <%coward_man> space suit good for burn up
[1:30:38] <%democrazyyy> @PatStaresAt if i remember right jacob describes you as "meat and tubes" when he sees you in progress
[1:30:38] <%HitchhikingThrough> Foreshadowing the probe minigame
[1:30:38] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt i don't think he fell all the way to the surface. Low orbit + protection from his suit stopped the worst of it.
[1:30:39] <SaltyAzteca> That N7 armor really does the job
[1:30:41] <ThatGuyThere03> on Earth? yes
[1:30:41] <%Varlinator> Not all orbits are the same
[1:30:41] <rekinom> What's stopping them of cloning an army of shepards?
[1:30:42] <%OrangeMDT> There could be stuff inside the suit
[1:30:42] <%AFellowDegen> and the planet had very little atmospherrr
[1:30:42] <+athuramn> but he had the best armor and barrier from me1,  he can survive anything
[1:30:42] <+D00msDayDan> also unless they recovered shep's body IMMEDIATELY everything in that brain is long gone no matter how they put it back together
[1:30:42] <%Urgotfantasy> SHUT UP ONE GUY
[1:30:44] <stantheman_97> alliance armor is just that good
[1:30:45] <%HanbaobaoZaiNar> the cheeto dust of shepard 1 forms the beard of shepard 2
[1:30:46] <tanarath> BARRIER PAT
[1:30:47] <Zeif00> It's all that plot armor
[1:30:47] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Like obviously the suit is good enough that he didn’t
[1:30:47] <Grandnatics> Like Master Chief survived crashing to earth
[1:30:48] <%Lizard0TM> CLONES
[1:30:48] <ThatGuyThere03> on another planet, maybe not
[1:30:48] <Pookiedaexzile> BARRIER !
[1:30:48] <%dekkitout> Yours, maybe
[1:30:48] <jorniev> YOU DONT KNOW HOW GOOD THAT ARMOR IS
[1:30:48] <%justnathan18> Why is Shepard THIS important?
[1:30:49] <AngryAsian5> He Barriered his way through re-entry LUL
[1:30:50] <+yashpar> There were clouds in the atmosphere. There's gotta be a decently thick atmosphere.
[1:30:50] <peachy996> It's not low gravity
[1:30:50] <TourettesPlays> the heart is a big pile of goo
[1:30:50] <%MidnightBurst12> you don't know
[1:30:51] <+ScrapKingKeita> Rubber lasers
[1:30:51] <+JaseAdrift> Your entire body would just be goo
[1:30:52] <mikesumusprime> you dont know how thick the atmosphere is though
[1:30:52] <TioXyco> how can you be so sure?
[1:30:52] <%sunsetdisc0> future magic
[1:30:52] <MagmaRam> Goo? That's optimistic.
[1:30:53] <%dave323dave> with space magic anything is possible
[1:30:53] <%watts121> A goo heart if you will.
[1:30:54] <SaltyAzteca> @ssjklyco I think that exists.
[1:30:54] <seancbo> I like how fucked his skeleton looks
[1:30:55] <James_Quivers> he landed on a pillow factory
[1:30:56] <%Deft_Thought> What are the odds that they'd call this shit "The Lazarus Project"
[1:30:56] <%shadowsofpain> either don't worry about it and hope that me3 answer that question for you
[1:30:56] <%LumberjackJack> Pat, did you forget how strong your barrier was in ME1? Kappa
[1:31:00] <%TheWinged7> that some damn good healing goo
[1:31:02] <CyberTheory> your heart IS a big pile of goo after all those monsters
[1:31:03] <ComfyFox> gotta live to see mirandas ass
[1:31:03] <%sporeian94> 3 literally says other than his brain he's a box of guts
[1:31:03] <+Shubreaker> it's a very strong suit
[1:31:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is dumb
[1:31:05] <%Robot_Nixon_> T R I L L I O N S O F M O N E Y
[1:31:05] <%Deadpal> Nyaah
[1:31:05] <+funkieboy> shephard is just built different
[1:31:07] <%toastybites> Deus Ex did this cooler
[1:31:07] <Taco_Salsaguy> sweet space medicine juice
[1:31:07] <%Monkeyweed21> you had max shield upgrades @PatStaresAt
[1:31:08] <Vantesla> From what I recall his body looked worse than Murphy from RoboCop...
[1:31:08] <+DappercatEsquire> new robot spine
[1:31:09] <%aWanderingKaivo> yeah it was just barrier lol
[1:31:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is robocop?
[1:31:10] <%Ravioli_Ronin> His bones are FUCKED
[1:31:11] <peachy996> I mean it is an iceball of a planet but your body would be ash still
[1:31:12] <nuane> we can rebuild him
[1:31:12] <%Deft_Thought> God damn space Christians making Shephard into Jesus
[1:31:14] <%democrazyyy> 4 billion credit man
[1:31:14] <+JaseAdrift> This is the dumbest shit in mass effect
[1:31:15] <%HitchhikingThrough> If shepard's body is in one piece you should be able to jump out of a spaceship and land on the ground
[1:31:16] <+burntbagels13> Ur a big pile of goo lol
[1:31:16] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU CAST BARRIER
[1:31:19] <JetpackMcQuack> so we brought him back to life
[1:31:19] <tattleworm> synthesis though
[1:31:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> Your corpse has as much HP as your max when alive.
[1:31:19] <+D00msDayDan> really cool surgery sequence though
[1:31:20] <+michingmallecho> It really is
[1:31:21] <%aWanderingKaivo> barrier was THAT strong
[1:31:21] <%Deft_Thought> Why not just say he was a fucking clone?
[1:31:22] <SpaceGuntank> you're literally bathing in Medi-Gel
[1:31:23] <%AFellowDegen> Just wait till they do it again for ME4
[1:31:23] <%Deadpal> @funkieboy Well yeah we're building him right now
[1:31:24] <+trackles_64> DC fans know the lazarus pit
[1:31:24] <iosephe> You mean like PSYCHICS?
[1:31:24] <Jetsfantasy> Anti Darth Vader serum
[1:31:25] <Virokwet> but element zeroo\
[1:31:25] <HaroldDonchee> this is almost 5th element levels
[1:31:26] <%TheWinged7> did they cut shepard open with a Xacto blade?
[1:31:29] <GameOver_Here> ARISE SPACE JESUS ARISE
[1:31:30] <%afronooch> nah, all races having compatible genitalia is the most unrealistic thing about mass effect
[1:31:30] <%vexion_smh> human is made of man goo if you think about it tbh
[1:31:31] <@SSaryn> Fuck it.
[1:31:32] <CyberTheory> NO

[1:34:33] <%walternatorz> 1.3k viewers
[1:34:33] <%NIGHTMARYxi> We did it
[1:34:35] <%OrangeMDT> Shepard is 25 years old

[1:34:38] <jorniev> LOOKS LIKE A DAD TRYING HIS BEST
[1:34:39] <PirateMike_> yeyeye
[1:34:40] <Pookiedaexzile> BIOTIC CHARGE
[1:34:40] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt so basically they resurrected this guy from a burned, frozen lump of meat, after he'd spent way longer dead than ANY kind of handwaving could explain... but they still couldn't fix his male pattern baldness.
[1:34:40] <+michingmallecho> Yep
[1:34:40] <+AmericanSkidd> as is custom

[1:34:48] <Omnislash195> Don't look
[1:34:48] <@SSaryn> Eyyy at least you were able to skip that.
[1:34:48] <James_Quivers> WAIT GO BACK AND FIX HIS NOSE
[1:34:49] <%hrbeck_> I expect nothing and receive less
[1:34:49] <spuginky> im gunna ONE GUY
[1:34:51] <%twistedj3ster> you figure the run is ruined?
[1:34:52] <%justnathan18> @OrangeMDT Hes 31 by 2.
[1:34:54] <%mike2hands> Worth it
[1:34:55] <+dante_must_die_exe> LUL
[1:34:55] <peachy996> Now we can be space racists
[1:34:55] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt Bad timing on the start, they patched it today so you get way less money transferred from 1 to 2
[1:34:57] <Jetsfantasy> Vanguard again?
[1:34:58] <AllenDeadman> yup
[1:34:59] <%sporeian94> THE WORST LEVEL UP SYSTEM
[1:34:59] <%Deadpal> >vanguard
[1:34:59] <tattleworm> CHARGE
[1:35:00] <SaltyAzteca> That simplification
[1:35:00] <+red_cuppa> i dont like this new system XDD
[1:35:02] <Josef_Stryker> CHARGE
[1:35:02] <Grandnatics> Wait did we skip the cutscene?
[1:35:02] <stormhawk9891> CHARGE
[1:35:03] <mr_sups> The absoulte LACK of Character Building
[1:35:03] <intestinal_bleeding> very neutred
[1:35:03] <niko_fredman> It only costs us 2 lives LUL LUL LUL
[1:35:03] <DatAsuna> By which you mean it doesn't
[1:35:04] <+AmericanSkidd> simplified as fuck
[1:35:05] <%Deadpal> CHARGE KING BRAH.
[1:35:09] <GustauveVIII> CHARGE MORE CHARGE
[1:35:10] <%Deadpal> ALL IN CHARGE.
[1:35:11] <$Futurecity10> Max out assault mastery first
[1:35:11] <%watts121> It's an action game.
[1:35:12] <Grandnatics> Chaaaaaaaaaarge
[1:35:14] <Pookiedaexzile> CHARGE
[1:35:17] <%postalnerd787> super simplified
[1:35:18] <Ipsenscastle> it's the worst levelling version in the series
[1:35:19] <%RubberFistFight> @templar010 yeah we was yelling about that on twitter.
[1:35:20] <+OmegaFatalis> this one sucks because you can have unused points
[1:35:20] <%charp35> I hate the way mass effect 2 upgrading works
[1:35:20] <+D00msDayDan> put it all into charge
[1:35:21] <%Varlinator> MAX ASSAULT MASTERY
[1:35:22] <Bigyanno> And this is why i don't like Mass Effect 2. They massively oversimplified the RPG elements
[1:35:24] <DatAsuna> the worst part of Me2 is how dumbed down the level and weapon upgrades are
[1:35:24] <luketrapwalker> That's what you get for skipping the cutscene
[1:35:26] <%aWanderingKaivo> charge upgrade restores more shields
[1:35:27] <%Deadpal> pat look at max charge.
[1:35:28] <%Robot_Nixon_> its for normies now
[1:35:29] <zerointelligence000> This was so weird coming in straight from Mass Effect 1
[1:35:30] <QuestlordJake> this shep looks ruthless
[1:35:34] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt the money thing
[1:35:37] <%templar010> Oh I didnt realize
[1:35:38] <%RubberFistFight> the patch that changed the money thing
[1:35:39] <%Deebo305> ignore cyro ammo
[1:35:39] <Sigma_190_Beta> DO CHARGE!
[1:35:39] <peachy996> God I forgot how Ammo Types were a power. I hated that
[1:35:41] <PirateMike_> It's fine?
[1:35:42] <%postalnerd787> It could be a bit better
[1:35:43] <%Deadpal> HEAVY CHARGE.
[1:35:44] <Sigma_190_Beta> BIGGER CHARGE!
[1:35:46] <%Vyskus> Idk less options than the first one seems meh
[1:35:46] <+trackles_64> no playthrough bonuses for pat.
[1:35:48] <@SSaryn> I mean, that's still good.
[1:35:48] <%HitchhikingThrough> credits
[1:35:53] <%sporeian94> BEFORE IT WAS 999000 CREDITS
[1:35:54] <%MidnightBurst12> many money
[1:35:54] <%templar010> Not too bad
[1:35:55] <$antibonehurtingjuice> it used to be 300k
[1:35:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> 146000 is still WAY MORE THAN ENOUGH
[1:35:55] <+InternetShis> CHAAAARGE
[1:35:57] <peachy996> Ammo Types should NOT be an ability
[1:36:00] <Zeif00> Ooof
[1:36:01] <Profmcstevie> Not poor Pog
[1:36:03] <+athuramn> 9k element 0
[1:36:03] <+InternetShis> FATTEST CHARGE
[1:36:04] <%dekkitout> It's more than 0
[1:36:04] <%twistedj3ster> yeah but no medi gel
[1:36:05] <%Lizard0TM> If you hadn't updated, you'd have 600k
[1:36:05] <teebos> they patched it today
[1:36:07] <%heartlesshealer> ?
[1:36:07] <%Robot_Nixon_> Not Poor LUL
[1:36:08] <+Gamblitz> Finally i catch a Pat stream
[1:36:09] <srv4254> medical bill
[1:36:10] <%Garthunox> @Too_Much_Nukie PFFFT!
[1:36:11] <%CalderGaming> looks good
[1:36:15] <$realm_forge> The money thing happens later
[1:36:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> ME2 doesn't have as many things to buy because all the things you buy are permanent upgrades.
[1:36:15] <%templar010> WAY BETTER actually
[1:36:16] <%heartlesshealer> oh the money, yeah
[1:36:20] <Jetsfantasy> It caps at 100k from what I've read
[1:36:22] <+InternetShis> It burnt all your moneys
[1:36:22] <firewhiskeys> started me2 with 999,999 it was wild
[1:36:28] <%justnathan18> It looks like Bill Burr fucked a cavewoman
[1:36:31] <%HanbaobaoZaiNar> should have accrued a lot more interest in 2 years, though being technically dead probably put a damper on that
[1:36:32] <Bigyanno> 2 words Pat. UNIVERSAL COOLDOWN
[1:36:33] <tanarath> @peachy996 me1's system was better
[1:36:33] <cellaccount> the power
[1:36:34] <%dekkitout> Keybinds, neat
[1:36:35] <%OrangeMDT> Man, this is like a whole game better than ME1
[1:36:36] <%Varlinator> psaBig PARAGON
[1:36:41] <+AmericanSkidd> now its much better
[1:36:41] <TourettesPlays> @peachy996 its so weird that vanguard gets both cryo and incendiary as if the player is meant to switch between them
[1:36:44] <Jetsfantasy> Oh you've got minor scars I think
[1:36:45] <%Deadpal> Remember about biotic and tech combos pat!
[1:36:46] <%Monkeyweed21> yea they fixed it in 2 for console
[1:36:47] <tattleworm> if you couldn't map charge it'd ruin everything
[1:36:49] <DatAsuna> they did that in the old version too tho
[1:36:51] <MagmaRam> @Bigyanno god I hate that change
[1:36:52] <+trackles_64> button fucking
[1:36:54] <stantheman_97> oh my god that wheel sound effect just hit me with huge nostalgia
[1:36:55] <%VioletHeart> I mean they were always mapped to buttons.
[1:36:57] <+D00msDayDan> 2 was actually built as a console game

[1:37:46] <%ingman112> PUNISHED SHEPARD
[1:37:47] <%bread_assassin> So if Shepard knows what a thermal clip is already, does that mean that the expendable thermal clips change happened in just a month?

[1:39:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Don't tell him
[1:39:37] <%LumberjackJack> 2 more points

[1:43:40] <%watts121> Look at Jacob...he's already thinking about cheating on FemShep. Licking his lips at the future cuck!
[1:43:40] <%justnathan18> Not literally fuck jacob though, he cheats on your lmao

[1:43:54] <%shadowsofpain> Go away worst Carth
[1:43:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Why does he look more like Kanye now
[1:44:00] <%furiousfurioso> I have absolutely zero memory of Jacob's existence
[1:44:01] <MagmaRam> Shepard maybe move your head like half a foot down
[1:44:02] <%kewlmyc> Jacob is cool
[1:44:03] <AlphaRayAllen> CAN I ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS SIR
[1:44:04] <%LumberjackJack> LUL Keep your head down
[1:44:04] <Louie_Salmon> Man their heads are just poking out there huh
[1:44:08] <$lotharrio> The only black man to ever join your squad, I think?
[1:44:08] <$SGrim> @sporeian94 Jenkins was less fleshed out.
[1:44:13] <%Varlinator> psaBig Squint
[1:44:13] <%GalacticaPhanto> Shaved Pat looks horrible
[1:44:14] <%justnathan18> My girlfriend romanced Jacob, she learned. She learned.
[1:44:19] <%aWanderingKaivo> @Pookiedaexzile looks the same as he always did
[1:44:25] <dd44dostivei> femshep is soooo creepy talking to jacob. he should call hr
[1:44:26] <reven229> It would be HILARIOUS if Shepard got hit right now talking to Jacob
[1:44:26] <+jerkhov> 3 has a brown guy
[1:44:30] <TourettesPlays> Yea I always forget the 2 year time skip, probably because its FUCKING STUPID
[1:44:30] <stantheman_97> jacob is just kinda there but i never thought he was bad
[1:44:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> They are very not in cover
[1:44:31] <%AFellowDegen> your eyes are so friggin tiny
[1:44:34] <dukenux> Shepard your shiny forehead wont deflect those projectiles
[1:44:38] <+AmericanSkidd> With the money they spent bringing back Shepard, you could buy 100,000 full sets of Krogan Testicles. The more you know.
[1:44:39] <Mangahero18> This game has the token black man and the next game has the token hispanic guy.
[1:44:39] <%snow_bush> THE PRIZE
[1:44:40] <$StrawberryPantsu> (SHEPARD WALK) GOD SHOW ME THE WAY! CAUSE THE REAPERS TRYIN' TA BRING ME DOWN!
[1:44:46] <JetpackMcQuack> Hmmmmmm4
[1:44:47] <$realm_forge> 🎶Jacob taylor was a fresh young sailor. Full of fight and full of flavor. 🎶
[1:44:52] <blkroseduelist> Give em a taste of the good shit!
[1:44:52] <dukenux> bwwwoom
[1:44:53] <Ipsenscastle> apparently if Jacob thinks you're interested in him and then you date Garrus or Thane he gets REALLY racist
[1:44:53] <%luckysteak> TOO BAD YOU DON'T HAVE THE OLD WEAPONS WITH UNLIMITED AMMO
[1:44:55] <%RubberFistFight> @justnathan18 yeah she did 😉 😏
[1:44:55] <tattleworm> can't charge to areas you can't physically get to, sorry
[1:45:00] <%GalacticaPhanto> Vega is so much better, like fuck hug me with those large arms
[1:45:01] <+bugz_munny> better kaiden
[1:45:02] <%AbnormalVoid> imagine he just died here again lmao
[1:45:04] <%sporeian94> Wait for the "GRAVITY'S ON MEAN MOTHER" line
[1:45:09] <TourettesPlays> Biotic detonations PogChamp PogChamp
[1:45:10] <+NeonLight> Vega was a better "normal military guy" imo
[1:45:13] <Blank9> worse kaiden
[1:45:14] <+black_pariah> damn i wish i got here earlier, wish i could have seen the chat react to this new pat face
[1:45:15] <+bugz_munny> Bladen
[1:45:18] <%LumberjackJack> You can't charge at unreachable areas, sadly
[1:45:18] <%Gamblitz> Why you so boring?
[1:45:20] <%RubberFistFight> @GalacticaPhanto fucken space freddie prinze junior
[1:45:24] <+jerkhov> Vega is John Gears of War
[1:45:24] <%justnathan18> Vega is so much cooler than Jacob by virtue of being the most realistic portrayal of 20 something military dude
[1:45:25] <%heartlesshealer> gotta tutorial
[1:45:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> The N7 armor looks so god damn good in this game.
[1:45:27] <Jetsfantasy> Imagine being the bastard who thought thermal clips were a good invention over the venting system LUL
[1:45:27] <+CursedNobleman> why do i hate you jacob? LUL
[1:45:30] <$lotharrio> I found the concept of Mechs to be pretty uninspired.
[1:45:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> So good that every game added it as DLC.
[1:45:35] <Pookiedaexzile> "Why is your lip stuck to your bottom teeth"
[1:45:37] <Broken_Sonex> "Are you black Kaiden?"
[1:45:38] <%AncelDeLambert> I love how the size of the thermal clip ejected depends on how many bullets you use
[1:45:39] <dukenux> A lot?
[1:45:42] <$StrawberryPantsu> WORF
[1:45:43] <+CursedNobleman> BUT THE PRIZZZZEEEEEEEEE
[1:45:43] <%embranz> Don’t be mean to Kanye West chat
[1:45:45] <LluthyY> I dont hate jacob, but dont care too much about him either
[1:45:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> 35 years? How old is he? 50?
[1:45:49] <canadadan55> it's all Jacob
[1:45:50] <JetpackMcQuack> Naw, that's IT
[1:45:51] <Ipsenscastle> Vega is much better but I still hate him for assuming he can call me 'Lola'
[1:45:53] <canadadan55> s fault
[1:45:54] <rekinom> and here he looks monkey
[1:45:54] <%Retinolgaming> He's a red shirt
[1:45:57] <T_Sasquatch> i dont see the kanye tbh
[1:46:01] <+JaseAdrift> Jacob's proportions are so fucked up
[1:46:01] <%AFellowDegen> HUGE forhead. with very small eyes
[1:46:03] <%watts121> @lotharrio Kinda makes sense if they are intentionally making the mechs suck in case a Geth situation happens again.
[1:46:05] <%Varlinator> It's just the lighting
[1:46:07] <stormhawk9891> THE PRIZZZZE
[1:46:08] <+jerkhov> neanderthal shepard
[1:46:08] <%GalacticaPhanto> @rubberfistfight I mean that was my crush growing up sooooo
[1:46:09] <%LumberjackJack> Shepard's packed back there. What a bussy
[1:46:10] <%saadi90> Basic bitch military man
[1:46:12] <dukenux> better when camera focuses on his jaw not his head
[1:46:12] <TourettesPlays> @Jetsfantasy Apparently its a Geth invention and it allowed them to kick ass before everyone else adopted it
[1:46:15] <T_Sasquatch> @rekinom 0_0
[1:46:22] <cellaccount> spat
[1:46:22] <+Shubreaker> MEAT AND TUBES

[1:46:42] <$dalmek> Meet N. Tube
[1:46:44] <%Deft_Thought> It shoulda just been cloning
[1:46:45] <Coystick> WHAT HAPPENED TO MY PEENO
[1:46:45] <%AbnormalVoid> Nutting Edge
[1:46:45] <%embranz> Heavy risk... but THE PRIIIIIZE...
[1:46:47] <TourettesPlays> Yea THIS Shepard is definitely not a CLONE
[1:46:47] <$lotharrio> @watts121 I meant more in the sense that humanoid robots don't make sense as war weapons. The drones from ME1 were more interesting.
[1:46:48] <PanicSwytch> Big Boss?
[1:46:49] <zerointelligence000> "you had a piece of shrapnel in your skull"
[1:46:50] <%watts121> He does have clone parts tho

[1:46:55] <+burntbagels13> They have beaten DEATH
[1:46:56] <%RubberFistFight> "Wow, jacob! TWO WEINERS?"
[1:46:56] <Parapattern> Pat's Shepard has a certain Throgmorton look to him
[1:46:56] <seancbo> Definitely made his dick bigger
[1:46:58] <+NeonLight> Ra'as al Ghul?
[1:46:58] <dukenux> Liquid Shepard
[1:46:58] <SaltyAzteca> "What can you tell me about the Reapers?"
[1:46:59] <%FierceDeityGabe> People are dying in the next room
[1:46:59] <+AmericanSkidd> Yes, YOU are not a clone...
[1:47:02] <+JaseAdrift> NOPE not a Clone
[1:47:05] <TourettesPlays> @sporeian94 Because that would be reaaaaally hacky and cliche lmao imagine
[1:47:08] <%hrbeck_> That explains the extra dong
[1:47:10] <reven229> WHAT HAPPENED TO MY HAIR!?
[1:47:11] <Ipsenscastle> @dalmek the worst Crash Bandicoot villain

[1:47:26] <jorniev> honestly human revolution has a crazier character resurrection
[1:47:29] <%Gamblitz> INSIDE JOB!
[1:47:30] <%GalacticaPhanto> People are screaming and dying and Shep is like "Hey do how big is my dong?"
[1:47:33] <%embranz> It’s my cock Shepard. It’s huge. And it matters. They like it. You jelly.
[1:47:37] <%aWanderingKaivo> @lotharrio I think they're meant to be more security than war machines, cerberus and merc and stuff just use them however they want though
[1:47:38] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I like how you're making Shepard look more and more haggard until by ME6 he'll finally look like you
[1:47:39] <SaltyAzteca> I love the press-nooooo
[1:47:42] <+D00msDayDan> shepard didn't ask for this
[1:47:43] <%RubberFistFight> @burntbagels13 nah they specifically mention that the tech can't be mass-produced, is horrifically expensive, and was basically a one-off fluke hail mary that shouldn't have worked in the first place.
[1:47:43] <canadadan55> arent you in charge of security Jacob?
[1:47:45] <+NeonLight> RIP Pressly
[1:47:45] <JetpackMcQuack> Not what I saw
[1:47:46] <%justnathan18> Youve got one of those hydrolic lifting dicks that they give dudes with ED
[1:47:48] <%LumberjackJack> Jacob's VA is good and character looks solid. Shame he's quite dull compared to everyone else.
[1:47:50] <Parapattern> PRESELY NO
[1:47:52] <Pookiedaexzile> yay
[1:47:53] <+stompingranger> Good

[1:48:08] <TourettesPlays> @ScottishMadJacko just hypothetically discussing how hypothetically stupid a shepard clone would be, hypothetically
[1:48:10] <tinytinykittycat> Just a few redshirts
[1:48:10] <+JaseAdrift> on the mouth
[1:48:12] <dukenux> but shep recovered from entering an atmosphere
[1:48:20] <+AmericanSkidd> There were like a dozen people who didnt make it what is he talking about
[1:48:22] <+jerkhov> the humans are all pretty boring in ME

[1:48:44] <+trackles_64> suss
[1:48:44] <$antibonehurtingjuice> that was pretty sus
[1:48:49] <%ScottishMadJacko> @TourettesPlays still spoilers, doesnt matter if youre being coy about it

[1:49:00] <%RubberFistFight> @ScottishMadJacko Wait, he hasn't played it AT ALL? Or he hasn't played this version? Since I'm damn sure he's talked about it multiple times on both the old AND new podcasts.

[1:49:16] <Broken_Sonex> @embranz If you're a women he cheats on you
[1:49:16] <Chaos_Aether> I just remember that Officer Boles in Arkham Asylum
[1:49:17] <%shadowsofpain> Look at your gun

[1:49:24] <reven229> Look at your gun, it's lit up with the ammo. You tapped it, remember?
[1:49:24] <%aWanderingKaivo> the ammo is a toggle on a weapon yeah
[1:49:25] <%Gamblitz> @embranz Jacob is speciest
[1:49:25] <+athuramn> ammo is a state, not an equip
[1:49:25] <+NeonLight> Hell yeah!
[1:49:26] <%aWanderingKaivo> its a buff
[1:49:27] <%HanbaobaoZaiNar> I'm sure Wilson will be a long and beloved party member, just like Jenkins
[1:49:29] <$SGrim> @ScottishMadJacko Pat has said he does not give a shit about ME3 spoilers. First stream of ME1 specifically.
[1:49:29] <$lotharrio> It's just a buff, yeah.
[1:49:30] <%VioletHeart> Look on the side of your pistol, Pat.
[1:49:30] <%watts121> Yeah it's not a buff, it's an overlay
[1:49:32] <Blank9> yeah they're free
[1:49:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Squadmates will use their ammo powers by default unless you tell them to turn it off too. Very handy.
[1:49:35] <%charp35> yeah there is a little icon on the gun
[1:49:35] <%DJFakie> You have to toggle for each gun
[1:49:35] <$realm_forge> It’s a power
[1:49:36] <+D00msDayDan> gives you a free reload too i think?
[1:49:36] <%watts121> I mean aura
[1:49:38] <SaltyAzteca> Cryo ammo is fun

[1:50:04] <LluthyY> after his loyalty mission you can get barrier
[1:50:04] <%watts121> the best part about ME2/ME3...Biotic Explosions.
[1:50:05] <Pookiedaexzile> You don't
[1:50:05] <tinytinykittycat> loyalty
[1:50:06] <%Varlinator> Loyalty
[1:50:07] <%LumberjackJack> Last skill unlocks from loyalty mission
[1:50:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> Loyalty mission unlocks the fourth ability.
[1:50:10] <%TheCallousKing> loyalty mission
[1:50:12] <+NeonLight> Yep
[1:50:12] <AlphaRayAllen> CASUALIZED
[1:50:12] <$LightningLynx89> Have to do his sidequest
[1:50:14] <%RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater hmm fair enough. Although like SGrim just said, he's also stated he doesn't give two fucks about ME3 being spoiled, so 🤷♂️
[1:50:14] <+Buzzkill983> Simplified
[1:50:15] <+bugz_munny> yeah ME2 really cut the fat
[1:50:17] <%AncelDeLambert> ah, beautiful streamlining
[1:50:18] <cellaccount> thsquad aint loyalese
[1:50:19] <%QueequegTheater> @athuramn Vanguard is the best class what are you on about
[1:50:20] <Pookiedaexzile> GEARS OF TALK
[1:50:21] <xcompleasedad> It's WAY more basic
[1:50:21] <iosephe> just like Jacob
[1:50:21] <%watts121> Cuz he's black...
[1:50:22] <nuane> Streamlined Kappa
[1:50:23] <Basch71> its why Sentinel is better because of Tech Armor
[1:50:24] <AlphaRayAllen> Why pat?
[1:50:24] <canadadan55> no human in party
[1:50:24] <DatAsuna> put it all into ammo
[1:50:25] <+D00msDayDan> gears of doody players are overwhelmed by actual RPG mechanics
[1:50:25] <$SGrim> @QueequegTheater Oh right, the "thing" is from the DLC
[1:50:27] <Ids560> yeah pat you have to go do his nonsensical loyalty mission
[1:50:27] <spuginky> unga level
[1:50:30] <+PodreySanchezz> Romance Jacob
[1:50:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt If you max out his ammo power he can spread it to the whole squad.
[1:50:32] <+OmegaWeltall> not as bad as Kaiden but still forgetable
[1:50:33] <reven229> You JUST need his loyalty mission and thats it
[1:50:34] <%Monkeyweed21> Y
[1:50:37] <QuestlordJake> SeemsGood
[1:50:37] <+burntbagels13> You get more
[1:50:40] <TourettesPlays> Jacob is tragically one of the best squadmates on higher difficulties
[1:50:40] <+Buzzkill983> Jacob is real bad...
[1:50:41] <%spoiledbadger> humans are uggo
[1:50:41] <%ScottishMadJacko> @RubberFistFight he said he really cares about citadel spoilers since it looks cool and fun
[1:50:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Pats being Racist .....towards humans again
[1:50:45] <%justnathan18> Kaiden at least has powers.
[1:50:48] <%QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight ME3 being spoiled is different from Citadel (widely considered the best content in the series) being spoiled
[1:50:53] <%QueequegTheater> BUT FUCK JACOB
[1:50:53] <%aWanderingKaivo> pat shep already has that ammo too
[1:50:55] <$lotharrio> The class levels are basically the best choice in my mind.
[1:50:55] <Jetsfantasy> This one is the opposite of the original, Heavy FPS light RPG elements
[1:50:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> Miranda.
[1:50:58] <%RubberFistFight> @ScottishMadJacko fair enough
[1:50:58] <+AmericanSkidd> a biotic who only knows pull what a loser
[1:50:59] <cellaccount> lol who
[1:51:00] <LluthyY> kaidan is adorable, jacob is just jacob lol
[1:51:01] <+BigBruthaThunda> i guess the basic boring staring teammate thing is intentional
[1:51:01] <$Futurecity10> Nope
[1:51:01] <$Faustgesicht> Tbf So Can Pat
[1:51:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> Literally Miranda.
[1:51:02] <TourettesPlays> No
[1:51:02] <%luckysteak> no
[1:51:02] <%Gamblitz> I hope for ME4 or whatever there is no squad npc limit
[1:51:03] <$antibonehurtingjuice> nope
[1:51:03] <+trackles_64> no
[1:51:03] <xcompleasedad> Yes?
[1:51:04] <blkroseduelist> yes lol
[1:51:05] <Ardailec> no
[1:51:05] <%shadowsofpain> nope
[1:51:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> No.
[1:51:06] <stormhawk9891> NO
[1:51:07] <%sporeian94> no
[1:51:07] <FennecZephyr> Not quite
[1:51:07] <%LumberjackJack> Ammo buffs are FAR better if focused on 1 person, not the squad
[1:51:07] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> I mean
[1:51:08] <sgtbloopface> nope
[1:51:08] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Not quite
[1:51:08] <%AFellowDegen> no
[1:51:08] <wolfen091> no
[1:51:08] <thelonechris> You're pretty crazy
[1:51:08] <%watts121> I don't think you can max in ME2
[1:51:08] <+JaseAdrift> no
[1:51:09] <Ipsenscastle> no
[1:51:09] <Basch71> no
[1:51:09] <SpaceGuntank> no, not at all
[1:51:09] <+stompingranger> yes
[1:51:09] <$Faustgesicht> Nope
[1:51:09] <%JamesCorck> No.
[1:51:10] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt yeah you wind up with massive excess
[1:51:10] <LudoJax> you dont max them, no
[1:51:10] <firewhiskeys> nah
[1:51:11] <Chaos_Aether> no
[1:51:11] <+Buzzkill983> I think it's 4443 ?
[1:51:12] <%Deebo305> No
[1:51:12] <+jerkhov> well you have the dlc
[1:51:12] <$Futurecity10> You have to skip one
[1:51:12] <CyberTheory> no
[1:51:12] <%ingman112> Just do what you want
[1:51:12] <TourettesPlays> You don't get enough points no matter what
[1:51:13] <nuane> I'll hang with Jacob...
[1:51:13] <%aWanderingKaivo> not iirc
[1:51:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> You get less points than you'd think.
[1:51:14] <%AFellowDegen> nope
[1:51:15] <%charp35> no
[1:51:15] <mikesumusprime> no
[1:51:16] <%sporeian94> nope not how that works
[1:51:16] <BenLanBen> no yes
[1:51:16] <Sigma_190_Beta> No there aren't.
[1:51:16] <tattleworm> you can go 4/4/4/1 if i remember right
[1:51:17] <IndoorSitup> No, not enough points are given
[1:51:17] <%luckysteak> at least one will be unmaxed
[1:51:17] <ShiningAxis> no, you get pretty close though
[1:51:18] <%JamesCorck> You won't max out everyone's abilities.
[1:51:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can get all skills up to 3.
[1:51:18] <FennecZephyr> You can get close
[1:51:19] <Lamokmok> I remember not in a first run.
[1:51:19] <%AncelDeLambert> psa3guy
[1:51:19] <LudoJax> the LEVELS max, but not the abilities
[1:51:19] <%dave323dave> i remember doing everything and not having enough
[1:51:20] <%bread_assassin> People will not end with 4 in all skills.
[1:51:20] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You need 1 more point to max all skills
[1:51:20] <sgtbloopface> nope you cant max all abilities
[1:51:21] <%RubberFistFight> Yes you can, i've done it.
[1:51:22] <reven229> You miss 1 ability I think in ME2
[1:51:22] <Ipsenscastle> you can't max them at all
[1:51:23] <%Varlinator> No
[1:51:23] <%charp35> you cant max everything
[1:51:23] <%watts121> Like 1 skill will be sacrificed
[1:51:24] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> No?
[1:51:25] <%JamesCorck> You can max 3 abilities per party member.
[1:51:25] <LluthyY> nope
[1:51:27] <%shadowsofpain> you can max everything but 1 tree
[1:51:27] <%ScottishMadJacko> @RubberFistFight glad we cleared that up, sorry if it came across as aggressive
[1:51:27] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Nope, you have to forgo 1 ability
[1:51:29] <AShinyVagikarp> I think this was just patched tho
[1:51:30] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt 4/4/4/3
[1:51:31] <%JamesCorck> But you don't need more than that.
[1:51:34] <SpaceGuntank> you can max two abilities and then half ass the rest
[1:51:34] <buhbuhboat> you cant max every skill
[1:51:34] <%HitchhikingThrough> @PatStaresAt use cheat engine & max it anyway
[1:51:34] <+AmericanSkidd> I think you can max 3 out of 4
[1:51:34] <wolfen091> the game stops leveling you up at some point
[1:51:36] <%democrazyyy> @PatStaresAt completing lair of the shadow broker unlocks the respec machine
[1:51:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's infuriating.
[1:51:37] <%charp35> unless you cheat
[1:51:39] <%Varlinator> You get pretty close
[1:51:39] <%Garthunox> what you mean everybody?
[1:51:40] <%Deebo305> Atleast 1 tree never gets maxed
[1:51:41] <$lotharrio> Just shy for everyone except Shep who is WAY too low because they get more stuff.
[1:51:44] <%LumberjackJack> Everyone gets 30 points total, so 3 full bars or 4 bars at 3
[1:51:45] <%Garthunox> like all powers?
[1:51:46] <sky_lives_> you can max out two at most
[1:51:46] <%ScottishMadJacko> but you can respec
[1:51:47] <%JamesCorck> Maxing skills to 4 4 4 3 is more than enough.
[1:51:50] <+D00msDayDan> CHEAT
[1:51:51] <%DJFakie> You get more
[1:51:54] <%VioletHeart> Seven later.
[1:51:55] <%aWanderingKaivo> shep gets more points I think
[1:51:56] <Ipsenscastle> you get more points
[1:51:57] <%AFellowDegen> you can get all but 1.5
[1:51:57] <+jerkhov> you get more points probably
[1:51:58] <%Retinolgaming> Youll have 7
[1:51:58] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, but who cares about cryo ammo
[1:52:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> No Shepard doesn't get enough to max 5 points. You also get a bonus ability later on.
[1:52:01] <AShinyVagikarp> yes
[1:52:02] <LudoJax> soon to be 7 skills
[1:52:02] <reven229> Shepard is better
[1:52:03] <%QueequegTheater> I honestly don't remember how many Shepard gets
[1:52:05] <%VioletHeart> Yeah you can unlock a bonus skill.
[1:52:05] <%DJFakie> Yes
[1:52:06] <%ScottishMadJacko> you get more points
[1:52:06] <Basch71> class upgrade
[1:52:07] <%Deebo305> Ignore Cyro ammo its useless
[1:52:07] <ShiningAxis> 7 skill for shep when you get party member skills
[1:52:07] <$Faustgesicht> Shep gets way more
[1:52:09] <DatAsuna> You don't want to max both ammos btw
[1:52:10] <%watts121> Shepard has special eyes, and special skills.
[1:52:11] <%JamesCorck> Pat, before you do anything, you don't need Cryo Ammo, it's super useless.
[1:52:11] <stormhawk9891> Shep gets one bonus skill
[1:52:12] <DatAsuna> Pick one and minmax
[1:52:12] <%DJFakie> Same as ME1
[1:52:15] <%bread_assassin> How come Pat doesn't have a bonus power? I started with the flashbang grenade.
[1:52:15] <+HelloImTom08> unlock a squad skill
[1:52:16] <buhbuhboat> ignore cryo ammo
[1:52:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh no
[1:52:19] <AlphaRayAllen> LUL
[1:52:19] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:52:20] <+jerkhov> D:
[1:52:21] <%HitchhikingThrough> Just hack the game make it give you what you want
[1:52:22] <%watts121> Yeah but it costs money
[1:52:22] <Pookiedaexzile> He's making the face
[1:52:22] <canadadan55> damn
[1:52:22] <%JamesCorck> Focus on Incendiary Ammo and all will die.
[1:52:23] <%aWanderingKaivo> true yeah it uses eezo
[1:52:24] <%AncelDeLambert> look, just max Shockwave and don't worry about it
[1:52:24] <%Mekhet09> You get bonus squad skills.
[1:52:24] <cellaccount> redo
[1:52:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah the respec is after Shadow Broker DLC thougyh.
[1:52:26] <%MrBorisMakarov> D:
[1:52:26] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> You can max out every thing if you keep one skill without any points.
[1:52:26] <%dekkitout> Hooray
[1:52:28] <+AmericanSkidd> there is a respec
[1:52:28] <%QueequegTheater> BUT IT COSTS MATERIALS THO
[1:52:28] <%kujofire990> it cost eezo tho
[1:52:29] <%JamesCorck> Also yes, ME2 has a re-spec.
[1:52:29] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt by the way you can retrain shep but only shep!
[1:52:29] <FennecZephyr> Respec fro Squad is hidden
[1:52:30] <LudoJax> Respec costs 5,000 element zero
[1:52:32] <Broken_Sonex> NotLikeThis This confusing.....
[1:52:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> hahahahahhah
[1:52:32] <+HelloImTom08> it costs a shit load of ezo tho
[1:52:32] <canadadan55> aint gotta do us like that but okay
[1:52:35] <+JaseAdrift> duh pat
[1:52:35] <Vantesla> Respect cost rare resources if I recall
[1:52:36] <%postalnerd787> codex on chair
[1:52:43] <%JamesCorck> Fire Ammo will carry you all the way to the end.
[1:52:44] <+JaseAdrift> that costs materials
[1:52:45] <%justnathan18> I dont think Pat cares enough to hack the game
[1:52:47] <%RubberFistFight> there's plenty of ezo in the game
[1:52:48] <peachy996> Maxing Both Ammos is a waste. Ammo is a dump stat imo
[1:52:49] <%Monkeyweed21> missed a datapad
[1:52:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> You'll have way more resources than you ever need.
[1:52:51] <%JamesCorck> The final boss is weak to fire lol
[1:52:51] <%RubberFistFight> like holy shit
[1:52:52] <%Varlinator> @QueequegTheater But scanning for materials is fun tho
[1:52:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Bitch you're drowning in materials by the end of this shit
[1:52:56] <%RubberFistFight> they're throwing it at you in this
[1:52:58] <cellaccount> log
[1:53:03] <%AncelDeLambert> I do love the heavy weapon just chilling on your back. Such a good addition.
[1:53:04] <%RubberFistFight> just go surveying and you'll get plenty.
[1:53:04] <%Gamblitz> If you can put glasses on your Shepard, he'll look like Dr Isaac Kleiner from Half Life 2
[1:53:05] <+NeonLight> Hi Tom!
[1:53:08] <%QueequegTheater> @Varlinator but he might need it later
[1:53:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah I'd abandon your incendiary ammo stat honestly.
[1:53:11] <SaltyAzteca> HA! No
[1:53:12] <sgtbloopface> respeccing costs lots of eezo and can only respec squadmates after shadow broker
[1:53:12] <%Deebo305> Respec is VERY expensive
[1:53:12] <UnImprest> fuck yea toonami
[1:53:13] <+HelloImTom08> the only good ammo is warp anyways
[1:53:13] <%MidnightBurst12> punch him
[1:53:14] <AlphaRayAllen> Ominous
[1:53:17] <$antibonehurtingjuice> what a simp
[1:53:17] <nuane> she didnt
[1:53:17] <cellaccount> creepo lol
[1:53:17] <Scorian> no sex
[1:53:18] <+trackles_64> Arm flex
[1:53:20] <$lotharrio> Listen to that braincel.
[1:53:21] <Essixian> "MAYBE NOW SHE'LL TOUCH MUH DICK"
[1:53:21] <+CursedNobleman> INCEL
[1:53:21] <buhbuhboat> tbh as vanguard you can ignore everything but assault mastery, charge and incendiary
[1:53:22] <+D00msDayDan> simping for miranda
[1:53:24] <%QueequegTheater> "Maybe now she'll sit on my face"
[1:53:24] <dd44dostivei> recorded history?
[1:53:24] <SaltyAzteca> She'll call you a bumpkin
[1:53:25] <ape_hawk> wilson just wanted miranda to sit on his face
[1:53:26] <canadadan55> lol dr simp had to fix shepard
[1:53:27] <+morton531> Wilson just wanted some Miranda booty
[1:53:28] <+Shubreaker> she's not gonna fuck you dude
[1:53:28] <%ScottishMadJacko> first respec is free tho right? also you can get way more resources than necessary. Im on 200k of every resource except eezo, only got 70k of that
[1:53:28] <%bread_assassin> Vanguard woulda been much better if it got Disruptor instead of Cryo ammo.
[1:53:28] <%DJFakie> Soldier slomo plus melee is awesome
[1:53:29] <+AmericanSkidd> "Fuck you God, we got him back"
[1:53:29] <%RubberFistFight> the people saying there's not enough are the people who never deviated from the core plot, didn't do the side quests, and probably failed the final mission.
[1:53:32] <+stompingranger> she gonna shoot
[1:53:33] <%RubberFistFight> there's PLENTY of resources.
[1:53:37] <thelonechris> So they brought a man back from the dead just so they could impress Miranda?
[1:53:37] <+leontalon> Miranda doesn't appreciate anything other than THIS DICK
[1:53:38] <%ssjklyco> Their security is shit if they are just leaving logs out for Miranda to hear you complaining about her.
[1:53:38] <tanarath> Simp alert
[1:53:39] <%ScottishMadJacko> No worries pat
[1:53:39] <%pokefan9956> I was in another window. that punching sounded like somebody gonna puke lol
[1:53:40] <peachy996> Ignore Cryo in this
[1:53:42] <$LightningLynx89> Imagine simping for Miranda
[1:53:43] <%hrbeck_> imagine somping for assy mcgee
[1:53:49] <%Varlinator> @QueequegTheater Chances are he'll do it off stream
[1:53:50] <%LumberjackJack> No worries, Mass Effect is chill

[1:53:58] <KeiPrime> but ass tho
[1:54:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> Cryo is fun in this but you have to pair it with concussion shot to really blow people up.
[1:54:00] <stormhawk9891> @buhbuhboat Shockwave is pretty good

[1:55:07] <%JamesCorck> Fuck yeah dude, you do it.
[1:55:07] <hippofant> Why not just cheat engine it in here??
[1:55:08] <%CatastropheCorvid> Why not just Cheat Engine THIS save?
[1:55:08] <canadadan55> 3rd times the charm i guess lol
[1:55:08] <%twistedj3ster> why not just cheat engine a level in this?
[1:55:08] <+fetrigon> FeelsWeirdMan
[1:55:10] <%sniffy77> BIG CHEATER GETS REWARDS
[1:55:10] <%fat_burtreynolds> Big Head Mode
[1:55:11] <Ipsenscastle> that's so unnecessary but ok
[1:55:11] <%bread_assassin> You're gonna go through that opening a THIRD time
[1:55:12] <%spoiledbadger> WHo cares?
[1:55:13] <%aWanderingKaivo> I mean you could just cheat engine THIS one
[1:55:13] <+jerkhov> Radiant Dawn tech
[1:55:14] <SaltyAzteca> But thats cheating D:
[1:55:16] <spuginky> yea thats right were gonaa CHEAT
[1:55:18] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[1:55:19] <%AncelDeLambert> you can just earn the level through gameplay anyways!
[1:55:19] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Fuck yeah, love Cheat Engine
[1:55:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> You could use the save editor tool instead of using cheat engine.
[1:55:19] <dukenux> why lol
[1:55:21] <Jmann1892> That's our Pat
[1:55:22] <$lotharrio> Don't you start with higher level anyway?
[1:55:22] <BenLanBen> vanguard shines in ME3, in this infiltrator with slowmo sniping
[1:55:26] <+Ropcord> This new party member seems interesting, I wonder how his loyalty mission will go :)
[1:55:26] <buhbuhboat> its not worth it
[1:55:26] <KeiPrime> if you're gonna cheat, might as well BIG cheat
[1:55:30] <dukenux> the games not that hard
[1:55:32] <%skizzuto> wouldn't it be faster to just cheat the extra level into this game rather than ME1
[1:55:32] <%shadowsofpain> why not just cheat here?
[1:55:33] <cellaccount> fix it
[1:55:33] <%Varlinator> @QueequegTheater He'll have plenty, trust me
[1:55:34] <Blank9> why not cheat engine THIS file and add a level to it?
[1:55:37] <dukenux> oh well then
[1:55:38] <reven229> Pat, story wise you DIED. It makes sense Shepard is out of touch
[1:55:39] <%watts121> Jacob: SUS...
[1:55:39] <buhbuhboat> you're playing on normal there is not need to minmax that hard
[1:55:40] <+athuramn> MIND GOBLINS AWAKENED
[1:55:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's not a bug, you can't be level 60 unless you're on NG+.
[1:55:41] <%spoiledbadger> yeah
[1:55:43] <%charp35> yup
[1:55:43] <%templar010> Yeah on nexus
[1:55:44] <%justnathan18> Man, FUCK the banshees in 3 without a good shot gun
[1:55:45] <+ThomasOfTroy> On the nexus, yeah
[1:55:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> There's a NEW save editor tool.
[1:55:46] <%QueequegTheater> @Varlinator but he might need it later
[1:55:47] <+Bail_Seven> yes
[1:55:48] <JetpackMcQuack> Can't be that hard
[1:55:48] <%templar010> There is one for the LE
[1:55:50] <%heartlesshealer> ah...
[1:55:51] <thelonechris> You literally shot yourself in the foot, guy
[1:55:51] <canadadan55> i didnt hear a gunshot over the radio
[1:55:51] <%Retinolgaming> @PatStaresAt Theres a new updated one for legendary edition on nexus
[1:55:53] <dd44dostivei> i saw new mods
[1:55:54] <$KetsuoTaberu> I think there's a new one
[1:55:55] <peachy996> Go for it
[1:55:56] <dukenux> just edit your level LIVE
[1:55:58] <+athuramn> GOBLINS GOBLINS GOBLINS
[1:55:59] <%LumberjackJack> I think they made it so you're only Level 5 at start if you ended ME1 at level 59-60
[1:55:59] <+D00msDayDan> if you can save edit you should use it to unlock legion before IFF
[1:56:01] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt i think so. Also +1 for the "save editor" option since you just said it was caused by a bug, which renders editing fair.
[1:56:06] <%komradedog> komradedog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! Ah, I see we started the next arc in “My Favorite Space War Criminal!”
[1:56:14] <tanarath> Simp is angry
[1:56:16] <%Varlinator> @QueequegTheater "might".... I should go
[1:56:16] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Don't forget to max out Renegade for that sweet robot face
[1:56:17] <+jerkhov> custom shepard always has messed up cheek bones, its seems like it can never look good
[1:56:18] <%heartlesshealer> idk "cheat engine"
[1:56:19] <%justnathan18> I thought Wilson was Pat. lol
[1:56:25] <%postalnerd787> I love how obviously a traitor this guy is
[1:56:27] <+athuramn> uh, I don't know if there's an updated one
[1:56:27] <AlphaRayAllen> Boota
[1:56:28] <canadadan55> naw man, ass is toooooooo fat
[1:56:28] <dukenux> you can edit lots of stuff in 2 with save files
[1:56:30] <SaltyAzteca> I'd probe that ass Kappa
[1:56:33] <%charp35> Oh do you know about the Conrad glitch?
[1:56:34] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Gotta find MirandER
[1:56:35] <%SirGO0SE> big boota

[1:56:36] <yourliteraldog> Sup gibronies
[1:56:37] <%aWanderingKaivo> @jerkhov_ yeah the animation always juts them out weird
[1:56:39] <+Shubreaker> OK NEVERMIND
[1:56:39] <%AbnormalVoid> her ass is too well defined for her to die
[1:56:40] <AngryAsian5> Have you SEEN that dump truck WIlson? LUL
[1:56:41] <%ScottishMadJacko> Wilson is all red flags
[1:56:41] <%shadowsofpain> Wilson you are so generic looking you must be the traitor
[1:56:41] <Broken_Sonex> IT'S MASSIVE DUDE
[1:56:42] <+kortin> I remember Jacob being really boring but that was forever ago when I played, is he as boring as I remember?
[1:56:43] <thelonechris> DROIDS
[1:56:43] <%capnbeefs> Her ass is huge, so who knows
[1:56:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i just got here, WHAT HAPPENED TO SHEPAT??
[1:56:45] <yourliteraldog> Roo bits
[1:56:45] <%fat_burtreynolds> 🍑
[1:56:46] <%Retinolgaming> psaBig Miranda
[1:56:57] <%QueequegTheater> @cobalt_phoenix_ he died
[1:56:58] <peachy996> Look at your glowy cyborg bits
[1:56:58] <%ScottishMadJacko> It did hurt him
[1:56:58] <%Gamblitz> he a robot!
[1:56:59] <%DJFakie> What if Wilson was a full game party member
[1:56:59] <%fat_burtreynolds> Shepard still sounds like he’s barely 26
[1:57:01] <%RubberFistFight> @heartlesshealer all sorts of cool shit uses cheat engine as a base though, like dark souls randomisers and stuff.
[1:57:02] <hat_under_bread> Because hard-coded tutorial moment.
[1:57:03] <Jetsfantasy> Time to bring back the old adage: That Ass Effect has my Mass ERECT
[1:57:04] <$lotharrio> It dropped his shields at least.
[1:57:07] <%HitchhikingThrough> @PatStaresAt yeah looks like there's one for legendary edition. Apparently was out before the game even released LUL
[1:57:07] <canadadan55> absolutely not
[1:57:08] <%Varlinator> yeah just stand right next to it
[1:57:09] <$milhousego> What's better, Miranda's Phat Ass, or Ramlethals perfect thighs?
[1:57:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> I mean you have the Cerberus logo everywhere.

[1:57:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's not a retcon.
[1:57:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Renegade Shep tho Pat
[1:57:50] <logothete2401> I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED
[1:57:50] <dukenux> Cerberus were like some random hate group in 1
[1:57:55] <peachy996> NO
[1:57:56] <%AncelDeLambert> it's fine you have brain damage don't worry
[1:57:56] <+jerkhov> gas lighting the guy whose squad they killed
[1:57:56] <%luckysteak> he will explain nothing!
[1:58:01] <+StoopKid241> Ask about Admiral Kahoku
[1:58:01] <+morningmoondude> Jacob's job is to be all of Cerberus' one black friend.
[1:58:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> Cerberus is still an evil terrorist organization. Jacob just drinks the kool-aid.
[1:58:05] <+kortin> if he's Illusive, why can I see him?
[1:58:08] <SaltyAzteca> cuz he's ILLUSIVE
[1:58:11] <JetpackMcQuack> Pro human alliance splinter SeemsGood
[1:58:12] <%QueequegTheater> His name is Martin Sheen
[1:58:13] <Pookiedaexzile> 3
[1:58:13] <iosephe> I guess this explains these past 5 years
[1:58:14] <thelonechris> His name's probably Greg or something
[1:58:14] <+D00msDayDan> oh his name isn't John "Illusive" Man?
[1:58:14] <+AmericanSkidd> Chat knows his name
[1:58:15] <+burntbagels13> FAKE. NEWS.

[1:58:21] <+MrTurtleThief> CARE berous
[1:58:22] <%postalnerd787> Big Hero Shep
[1:58:25] <%Varlinator> He's VERY ILLUSIVE. He's also a MAN
[1:58:25] <nesbitt22> Im late Pat shaved?
[1:58:27] <%Gamblitz> So what is that glowy red stuff on shepard?
[1:58:31] <+jerkhov> strong statement
[1:58:32] <%MidnightBurst12> but they're pretty big
[1:58:32] <TourettesPlays> Cerberus deliberately cut out the part of Shepards brain that remembered Cerberus was behind Torfan
[1:58:33] <+bubblebasspickles> so brave
[1:58:33] <peachy996> Jacob trying to skirt the issue
[1:58:34] <iosephe> But terrorists are very cool
[1:58:41] <%aWanderingKaivo> @Gamblitz cyberscars
[1:58:43] <AShinyVagikarp> SeemsGood SeemsGood
[1:58:43] <%QueequegTheater> @Gamblitz robot parts
[1:58:44] <dukenux> Never heard of em but they sound like BADDIES
[1:58:44] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Shoot them
[1:58:47] <%justnathan18> @Gamblitz Cybernetics
[1:58:47] <nuane> please antagonize Illusive Man at every opportunity
[1:58:49] <+Buzzkill983> This game is in honor of all the Brave Cerberus troops fighting for freedom
[1:58:50] <iosephe> so it's morally gray
[1:58:50] <%MidnightBurst12> the asses?
[1:58:51] <%Gloom_Tangerine> Tell that to everyone on DS9
[1:58:51] <AlphaRayAllen> Ah Wilson, everyone's favorite party member
[1:58:51] <Vakojin> Remember when he killed all those butarians because of one terrorist.
[1:58:52] <%HitchhikingThrough> @TourettesPlays I would have tbh
[1:58:52] <peachy996> The problem with Jacob is that he buys this trash
[1:58:53] <Basch71> terror bad, but the ass is big
[1:58:53] <%ScottishMadJacko> i always liked the reputation scars they give you in this
[1:58:55] <%QueequegTheater> YEEEEAHHHHH
[1:58:58] <+Kaiserzelcor> How do you feel about working with Nazis that resurected you, Shepard?
[1:58:59] <yourliteraldog> The way I approached cerberus was oh I'm going to betray them the first chance I get
[1:58:59] <wolfen091> ter doesn't always have to end with orrist
[1:58:59] <%VioletHeart> @Gamblitz Scars from being brought back to life. They become redder and more evil if you go renegade, but heal if you go paragon.
[1:59:00] <%watts121> @Varlinator Oh fuck Illusive Man is a Kojima character...HE EVEN HAS A FAMOUS VA!
[1:59:01] <viewtifulr> I love the tackle
[1:59:02] <+Ropcord> cybernetics from when miranda stapled his corpse back together
[1:59:02] <+black_pariah> ALWAYS be charging
[1:59:02] <+jerkhov> the combat is so much faster in 2 and 3
[1:59:08] <jorniev> i still cant belive cerberus is not ruledd by 3 different groups, because then its named cerberus for almost no reason
[1:59:08] <%QueequegTheater> ZOOM ZOOM MOTHERFUCKER
[1:59:11] <%Varlinator> ZOOOOM!
[1:59:12] <%RubberFistFight> kinda disappointed they never had a side-quest chain that was essentially a shep identity crisis where he's struggling with the idea that he might not be "the same person" anymore. He just kinda...accepts it.
[1:59:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Don't forget about power combos. If Jacob pulls an enemy and you charge into them while they float they will explode.
[1:59:16] <Blank9> and 3 is where it stole the show
[1:59:18] <Ipsenscastle> Wait wtf where is the bypass minigame? Did Pat mod out the bypassing, or did the PC version not have it?
[1:59:19] <helios_io> queue the Terragrigia commercial to teach us about Terrorism
[1:59:19] <TourettesPlays> Every class is like its own thing in ME2 its great
[1:59:19] <%AzureGale> That  charge is p good
[1:59:22] <Pookiedaexzile> WE CHARGE, WE SPLODE, WE CHARGE AGAIn
[1:59:23] <SpaceGuntank> every class got a lot better in 2
[1:59:25] <+Buzzkill983> Vanguard went from oh neat, to most METAL class
[1:59:25] <KeiPrime> cross classes in me1 were pretty lackluster
[1:59:27] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Max out the charge and you won't even need any guns
[1:59:28] <iosephe> what the fuck is that achievement
[1:59:29] <%heartlesshealer> I admit charge is pretty cool here
[1:59:30] <+athuramn> RETCONNNNN
[1:59:30] <plaguedoctor_syan> So Sheperd says "i am Sheperd" every time he uses charge?
[1:59:31] <%Robot_Nixon_> Cerberus crew died to robot janitors LUL
[1:59:32] <%shadowsofpain> God Charge in me3's multiplayer was so fucking fun, charge in then krogan headbutt to the top
[1:59:33] <dukenux> terr-a, terr-rorist
[1:59:38] <Broken_Sonex> SPACE BOOST
[1:59:38] <%Varlinator> Never gets old
[1:59:39] <%fat_burtreynolds> No quick turn?
[1:59:42] <dukenux> coincidence?
[1:59:44] <%RubberFistFight> Like "Oh yeah the massive group of super-rich space-racists that constantly lie, cheat and steal told me I'm not a clone so that's good enough for me!"
[1:59:44] <+jerkhov> krogan vanguard was the shit
[1:59:44] <peachy996> YEAH BIOTIC CHARGE BITCH
[1:59:46] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:59:47] <Gorshum> Vanguard is the best.
[1:59:48] <Chaos_Aether> still prefer infiltrator
[1:59:48] <dd44dostivei> by 3 biotic charge makes the game turn based. you have to use your power wheel to determine your next action sometimes
[1:59:48] <Josef_Stryker> MANGUARD
[1:59:49] <jorniev> ITS SO FUN
[1:59:50] <+OmegaWeltall> Vanguard is FUCKIN DOPE
[1:59:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> Vanguard is rad yeah.
[1:59:51] <%bread_assassin> Is Charge still good on Insanity? That seems like a quick way to get killed.
[1:59:51] <%MidnightBurst12> hell yeah it does
[1:59:53] <TourettesPlays> @Too_Much_Nukie biotic combos are such a hidden mechanic they're very complicated in 3
[1:59:53] <HaroldDonchee> God I forgot how much I loved the 2 half circles for cooldowns
[1:59:53] <%AncelDeLambert> you mean what YOU were talking about?
[1:59:54] <%Varlinator> All you need is charge!
[1:59:54] <AdamLon4> Adept >>>
[1:59:54] <DatAsuna> It rules much harder in 3 is all
[1:59:55] <%ScottishMadJacko> Vanguard is like the best action glass
[1:59:55] <sgtbloopface> vanguard is the best man
[1:59:56] <%LumberjackJack> THEY ARE COWARDS
[1:59:56] <canadadan55> no re spin?
[1:59:58] <%twistedj3ster> no RE spin
[1:59:58] <+Shockrates20XX> IT WAS YOU
[1:59:59] <yourliteraldog> Vangaurd is a good class
[1:59:59] <Virokwet> who talking smack about vanguard
[2:00:00] <BlueLunecy> You think THIS is good? 3 is even better
[2:00:00] <+D00msDayDan> quick turn? you mean the resident evil spin?
[2:00:01] <LluthyY> vanguard can get pretty insane
[2:00:01] <Ipsenscastle> we all were saying it rules though?
[2:00:02] <beefcakemanthrob> vanguard is so much fun
[2:00:02] <+black_pariah> charge shoot charge again
[2:00:02] <%logoth_> you said vanguard sucks pat
[2:00:03] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt In 3 Vanguard becomes a DBZ character
[2:00:04] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> Mass Effect 3's combat has no right to be as good as it is
[2:00:04] <KeiPrime> quick turn? what is this resident evil?
[2:00:04] <tattleworm> vanguard is a whole different game, we reject your premise of a cover shooter
[2:00:05] <+AmericanSkidd> In 3 it becomes even BETTER
[2:00:05] <AdamLon4> Adept gets much more fun in ME3 ngl
[2:00:05] <%MugenSandan> BIOTIIIIIIIC CHAAAAAARGE
[2:00:05] <%aWanderingKaivo> @PatStaresAt make sure to upgrade charge, upgrades make it restore more and more shields
[2:00:11] <%AncelDeLambert> shockwave is fucking amazing, too
[2:00:11] <%maenos2> see?  fuck those saying other classes, vanguard the best!
[2:00:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> @TourettesPlays The game tells you about them in the codex tho
[2:00:11] <+jerkhov> soldier is the worst clas
[2:00:11] <cellaccount> he was well done and iced
[2:00:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Imagine being a Turian solider seeing a hill full of Krogan Vangaurds BIotic Charging at them
[2:00:13] <%DJFakie> Rougher on high difficulties on 2. ME3 is better
[2:00:14] <+Shockrates20XX> YOU are the one who said everything but Soldier sucks
[2:00:16] <sgtbloopface> charge in 3 is so nuts I love it
[2:00:17] <SaltyAzteca> SAFE
[2:00:17] <Ipsenscastle> YOU were the one who was saying it didn't rule
[2:00:18] <yourliteraldog> Engineer gang rise up
[2:00:18] <+Ropcord> "he's literally a pile of meat but it's fine"
[2:00:20] <DatAsuna> @bread_assassin no, insanity is all about soldier and infiltrator because ME2 spawns so many guys on out of world platforms
[2:00:20] <%Retinolgaming> Vanguard in 3 is bonkers
[2:00:20] <BenLanBen> no shield recharging SUPERNOVA ability in me2 tho
[2:00:21] <beefcakemanthrob> also super fun in 3 and 3's multiplayer
[2:00:21] <VeryTricky> did she sit on the floor to use that computer?
[2:00:22] <%heartlesshealer> no RE spin
[2:00:23] <TourettesPlays> Vanguard = Sentinel > Infintrator >>>>>> everything else
[2:00:23] <%templar010> Yeah its such horsehit they were able to bring you back but fuck it
[2:00:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> MISSED SAFE
[2:00:25] <+kortin> I always thought Miranda's face looks really uncanny and unpleasant to stare at
[2:00:26] <%watts121> I wish they kept Heavy Weapons in ME3
[2:00:26] <%fat_burtreynolds> Me3 Vanguard basically turns you into Goku
[2:00:27] <%justnathan18> Wallsafe
[2:00:30] <%ScottishMadJacko> You missed a safe
[2:00:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> Missed a wall safe Pat.
[2:00:30] <%postalnerd787> Omni-tool gets a lot cooler in 2
[2:00:31] <Jaysky> GOOD.
[2:00:32] <%Monkeyweed21> WALL SAFE
[2:00:32] <%Agami23> you said that about mass effect 1
[2:00:35] <%watts121> It's the best one.
[2:00:36] <%DarrenCastro> ME2 Vanguard is fun in all but Insanity. ME3 Vanguard is fun in ALL difficulties
[2:00:36] <%dave323dave> me2 feels like the most replayable of the trilogy
[2:00:38] <%QueequegTheater> Sentinel is a fucking walking tank in 2
[2:00:40] <ScreamLord> Sovereign: I am the Vanguard of your destruction. Shepard: THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SAY!?
[2:00:40] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Oh so I guess he didn’t go through atmospheric reentry
[2:00:40] <+D00msDayDan> give us like 4 ME2 playthroughs before getting to 3
[2:00:41] <%heartlesshealer> safe? the panel with the red light on it?
[2:00:42] <reven229> Better than ME1?
[2:00:42] <peachy996> It only gets better in 3
[2:00:44] <Alzero83> I played the shit out of this game
[2:00:44] <IndoorSitup> WALL SAFE
[2:00:44] <Jaysky> 2 is amazing and one of my favorites of all time
[2:00:47] <+burntbagels13> His penis is almost completely gone
[2:00:47] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Oh look its Chobits
[2:00:47] <%saadi90> Safe!
[2:00:50] <NitronStreams> "HACKING"
[2:00:50] <+athuramn> Vanguard is good, but best in 3, which is why it's weird to play lesser versions of the best version in the other games
[2:00:50] <+AmericanSkidd> mini game tyme
[2:00:50] <%RubberFistFight> @templar010 And it's barely even questioned. IMO it's the weakest part of this game.
[2:00:51] <GreGHWiggy> my word you're so fucking blind LUL LUL LUL
[2:00:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt There's a finite amount of money you can get in this game so we're going to be annoying about missed safes.
[2:00:53] <$lotharrio> It's just memory.
[2:00:53] <+trackles_64> hackermans
[2:00:54] <%MrBorisMakarov> YRAH THIS GAME
[2:00:57] <+jerkhov> sentinel is cheating for hardest difficulty
[2:00:57] <%fat_burtreynolds> Me2 is worth dusting off the old ps3
[2:00:58] <%LumberjackJack> It just feels LEAGUES better than ME1, even with the LE changes to 1's gameplay
[2:01:01] <%JoshManVGH> They follow the circuit paths
[2:01:03] <corepercentlives> you can't revive consciousness - Shepard a clone in my book
[2:01:06] <%dekkitout> Does Shep throw anything shaped like a "Thank you for the respawn" at Wilson
[2:01:06] <Jaysky> @reven229 Sure as hell plays better than it
[2:01:08] <Ipsenscastle> okay so he was just missing the bypass things, that makes more sense
[2:01:08] <%HitchhikingThrough> Can someone please make a good hacking minigame
[2:01:11] <Pookiedaexzile> I played 2 10 times  thru when I was in the 8th grade
[2:01:12] <%postalnerd787> Bit better of a mini-gam
[2:01:12] <%heartlesshealer> oh these
[2:01:15] <ape_hawk> it is
[2:01:15] <$SGrim> @TourettesPlays Soldier>>>Vanguard = Sentinel > Infintrator >>>>>> everything else Fixed that for you
[2:01:15] <$antibonehurtingjuice> get used to it
[2:01:16] <tanarath> Yeah!
[2:01:18] <jorniev> EEEEH
[2:01:19] <%HitchhikingThrough> Like one that's actually fun
[2:01:22] <%HitchhikingThrough> please
[2:01:22] <+MrTurtleThief> sound effects are fun
[2:01:23] <+red_cuppa> these minigames were more fun lol
[2:01:23] <tattleworm> but what if it was pipedream
[2:01:25] <thehullowed> !uptime
[2:01:25] <@Moobot> @thehullowed I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 1m.
[2:01:25] <%QueequegTheater> Flashcards > Frogger
[2:01:29] <SpaceGuntank> its cooler but at the same time if you fuck it up you get locked out permanently.
[2:01:29] <NitronStreams> Its not frogger
[2:01:30] <%JoshManVGH> All the hacking games are way better than the first one.
[2:01:30] <SaltyAzteca> @HitchhikingThrough bioshock?
[2:01:31] <tanarath> I really wished they'd back-ported them
[2:01:32] <+NeonLight> Nier Automata had best hacking
[2:01:32] <cellaccount> amonguss
[2:01:32] <ape_hawk> bye
[2:01:33] <$antibonehurtingjuice> f
[2:01:35] <peachy996> This is easy
[2:01:37] <%Varlinator> you mean compared to simon fucking says? LUL
[2:01:37] <TourettesPlays> @HitchhikingThrough System Shock 2 has a fun one because its disguised as a minigame but its all based on skill level
[2:01:38] <%RubberFistFight> @Too_Much_Nukie the "finite amount" is still WAY more than you could ever need though. Especially if you import a save. I finished the game flush with cash and I wasn't exactly frugal with it.

[2:02:05] <%templar010> I love how Shep has his gun on her when they cut to them
[2:02:05] <%HitchhikingThrough> @SveriSageAdvice that one might be, I haven't played much of it
[2:02:05] <%justnathan18> Miranda is so cool
[2:02:08] <+jerkhov> we bang, ok
[2:02:09] <%DizzyGunner> why does everyone act like miranda is SUPER australian?

[2:02:11] <QuestlordJake> your Australian is uncanny
[2:02:14] <stormhawk9891> Bitch
[2:02:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> @RubberFistFight If you want to buy every single upgrade and cosmetic item there's not as much wiggle room as you'd like.

[2:02:20] <UnImprest> god shes hawt
[2:02:21] <thelonechris> She's not a great person
[2:02:21] <cellaccount> think jakeup
[2:02:23] <ScreamLord> Australians are genetically superior says Miranda's Dad
[2:02:24] <%justnathan18> Man that gun looks stupid
[2:02:25] <+fetrigon> SHE'S HOT AND THEREFORE MORALLY GRAY AT WORST!
[2:02:27] <%HitchhikingThrough> You could have shot him in the leg
[2:02:27] <ThatGuyThere03> WOW
[2:02:29] <%SveriSageAdvice> @HitchhikingThrough its definitely the first one i actually super liked
[2:02:29] <%postalnerd787> Miranda chooses all the Renegade options
[2:02:29] <Zalapski> yvonne <3 <3
[2:02:34] <%TheWinged7> i dont know if its the weird hair but her face looks.... wrong
[2:02:38] <tanarath> Yeah!
[2:02:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Why would you have a glowing billboard of what ammo you're using
[2:02:42] <willsin4fun> where's Shep-pat's facial hair, I need continuity
[2:02:42] <Ids560> dude I kinda hate every word out of everyone's mouth so far
[2:02:43] <%Ravioli_Ronin> “I’m never wrong, except when I work for a racist terrorist organization”
[2:02:43] <+trackles_64> step on me plz
[2:02:44] <%templar010> oh no HOT EVIL
[2:02:44] <%miguelrod777> morally grey
[2:02:46] <jorniev> SHE IS SO MORALLY GREY
[2:02:46] <yourliteraldog> She ain't got a forehead she got a 5head
[2:02:47] <%RubberFistFight> @ScreamLord Miranda's dad who is voiced by a new zealander XD
[2:02:47] <%UvBenServed> Morally gray
[2:02:49] <thelonechris> She looks plastic
[2:02:49] <Pookiedaexzile> That the enemy can read
[2:02:49] <%bassoontyphoon> #girlboss
[2:02:49] <+MrTurtleThief> morally grey
[2:02:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> Did they edit out Miranda's camel toe?
[2:02:52] <ape_hawk> who has the wider hips, miranda or tali?
[2:02:52] <Mangahero18> Something about Miranda seems...different. Smaller somehow? Hmmm what could it be.
[2:02:53] <%watts121> Miranda is the reason in a game with alien babes...I returned to the glory of humanity.
[2:02:54] <KeiPrime> why not take the free renegade poiont
[2:02:54] <%ssjklyco> Youre in her Ass effect field
[2:02:54] <peachy996> I like Miranda WAAAAYYY more than Ashley despite being a Cereberus Toady at the start
[2:02:57] <cellaccount> the man of illusive
[2:02:57] <+jerkhov> her face is fine it's the fivehead
[2:02:58] <%shadowsofpain> Hot, evil? Perfect wife material
[2:02:59] <%Gamblitz> Miranda is female Kahn noonien singh
[2:03:01] <+takotoots> hot + evil = morally grey
[2:03:02] <+Nomad_Scholar> I find it funny that, with all their technology, Cerberus couldn't fix Pat's balding.
[2:03:04] <SaltyAzteca> waheeeey
[2:03:05] <+Ghufufin> her face looks really small here
[2:03:06] <Pookiedaexzile> What dat ass do
[2:03:07] <+OmegaFatalis> also your giant logos everywhere
[2:03:08] <$SGrim> She's not that hot.
[2:03:08] <%QueequegTheater> FUCK YOU JACOB
[2:03:09] <Lamokmok> How big is you ass?
[2:03:13] <%heartlesshealer> is the lipstick why her mouth looks so big?
[2:03:14] <+liquidzr0> adumBooty
[2:03:15] <+MrTurtleThief> @peachy996 I think thats how most feel
[2:03:15] <nuane> HE WHAT
[2:03:17] <TheIronBrass> LUL
[2:03:18] <%watts121> fuck I gotta go play this again.
[2:03:20] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Thane is the morally correct romance choice
[2:03:21] <%fat_burtreynolds> They made her forehead too small. Makes her eyes look squinty like she has **** *********
[2:03:22] <+athuramn> Jacob cheats?
[2:03:23] <BenLanBen> tell her to say commander again LUL
[2:03:23] <buhbuhboat> Jaecob
[2:03:25] <$lotharrio> Like instantly starts cheating on her, too. She's in jail for six months and he doesn't even send a letter.
[2:03:26] <Pookiedaexzile> "Do dat ass fart"
[2:03:26] <yourliteraldog> She is a buttter face
[2:03:28] <JetpackMcQuack> laugh at the corpse
[2:03:28] <%coreyyotto> Did they lose the rights to her original likeness? Wasn't she modeled after an actor?
[2:03:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> Miranda still has her hair sitting on top of her head in a really weird way.
[2:03:31] <+LordSDB> @yourliteraldog LUL
[2:03:32] <%bassoontyphoon> The prize
[2:03:33] <+jerkhov> Miranda Pawgson
[2:03:36] <%MrBorisMakarov> I forgot how big her hair is
[2:03:37] <+fetrigon> I WANT FUCK WITH YOU
[2:03:37] <Broken_Sonex> Miranda is the PEAK of Morally Grey
[2:03:38] <kylejburke> look at her giant front teeth lmao
[2:03:38] <yourliteraldog> Her ass is top tier
[2:03:39] <KeiPrime> its her hair looks REALLY big
[2:03:39] <%Gamblitz> welcome to the EVUL SIDE!!
[2:03:42] <UnImprest> her huge jaw upsets me personally
[2:03:45] <thelonechris> Why does she look so weird compared to everyone else?
[2:03:49] <%toastybites> "I'm Commander Shepherd and that is the best ass on the Citadel"
[2:03:50] <%Deft_Thought> What a stupid premise, man
[2:03:50] <yourliteraldog> I will conceed her ass is phat
[2:03:50] <$antibonehurtingjuice> miranda is ok
[2:03:51] <%justnathan18> Does anyone else think its weird that THE ONLY BLACK GUY is the one that cheats on you and gets another woman pregnant?
[2:03:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> Hey you'll get 2 cool humans later.
[2:03:53] <ape_hawk> oh look, TWO ashleys
[2:03:55] <%ssjklyco> Still better than Ashely
[2:03:55] <Ids560> dude they suck so bad
[2:03:56] <tanarath> COME ON JUST FUCKING CHECK HOLY SHIT
[2:03:57] <Jaysky> Eh, Miranda is honestly fine. It's just not Tali.
[2:03:59] <Sp3ctre48> Only black squadmate, only romance that ends with him cheating on you, thank you Bioware ResidentSleeper
[2:04:01] <%shadowsofpain> Miranda's great, Jacob can rot
[2:04:01] <+YabbaTroll> She looks like an enlisted ai
[2:04:01] <%Deft_Thought> "You're our ONLY HOPE, Shephard!"
[2:04:02] <dukenux> arent they?
[2:04:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> Arguably 3 cool humans.
[2:04:03] <blue8moon> The fact everyone calls him that is very silly
[2:04:03] <%QueequegTheater> @UnImprest oh god, cannot unsee
[2:04:05] <%HitchhikingThrough> Videogames have a problem where they don't know how to make someone that is actually evil. Evil people don't go around telling people they're evil.
[2:04:05] <+Shockrates20XX> I like Miranda actually
[2:04:07] <SaltyAzteca> kinky
[2:04:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Renegade options all just say:"Smack dat"
[2:04:09] <%LumberjackJack> Cerberus are a swell bunch, huh? At least the other humans you get are all much better
[2:04:09] <+AmericanSkidd> What can you expect from CERERUS
[2:04:11] <%sniffy77> i bet shepard could probably kill all the mechs
[2:04:12] <+Shubreaker> do her arms look super long or is it just me
[2:04:13] <peachy996> @MrTurtleThief I think because she explains why she joined Cereberus and how it's not "Fuck Aliens"
[2:04:14] <%RubberFistFight> @thelonechris Well that ass has to have a downside.
[2:04:15] <%Varlinator> YOU WORKED ON ME FOR 2 YEARS?!
[2:04:18] <%bassoontyphoon> Knocking it outta the park himans
[2:04:18] <sgtbloopface> miranda is the best human squadmate which says a lot about the human squadmates
[2:04:21] <+red_cuppa> also miranda that's such a fucking lie what if he just stood there and Didn't Go With You
[2:04:23] <RetributionP> OH GOD PAT LOOKS SUPER WORSE
[2:04:25] <+ryuguitarfreak> MIRANDA IS GREAT
[2:04:28] <cellaccount> why my penus itch Miranda
[2:04:32] <%CatastropheCorvid> "You put two years into me, I'll put 8 inches into you."
[2:04:38] <$lotharrio> The lieutenant of the space-racism terrorists is less space-racist than Ashley. noquarHAAA
[2:04:38] <%fat_burtreynolds> She got that Paul Dean hair, space racism in that hair too
[2:04:39] <%RubberFistFight> @sgtbloopface What about jack tho
[2:04:42] <%watts121> Prologue ain't over yet.
[2:04:42] <%Ranryu692> look at that Runabout lol
[2:04:43] <dukenux> does Jacon explain why hes in the cerberus
[2:04:44] <+jerkhov> the short haired girl in Andromeda has fatter ass but nobody wants to hear that
[2:04:52] <%shurtal> two years of tech advancement
[2:04:52] <dukenux> Jacob*
[2:04:54] <dd44dostivei> how?
[2:04:56] <TourettesPlays> Telos is more ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper  than Taris
[2:04:57] <%QueequegTheater> TIME TO DO BIG RENEGADE
[2:04:57] <%Nobrev> "You have to survive. You are the only one worth saving" "You can stay here and rot if you dont want to come with us"
[2:04:59] <Nikbottom> It’s a dumb plan btw
[2:04:59] <+D00msDayDan> ooh the implants are showing
[2:05:00] <ape_hawk> @CatastropheCorvid more like "You put two years into me, I'll put two inches into you."
[2:05:00] <%Gamblitz> Is it me or does Miranda look always high?
[2:05:01] <Broken_Sonex> @sgtbloopface Too tryhard
[2:05:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> JACOB WHY ARE YOUR TEETH SO WHITE?
[2:05:02] <%aWanderingKaivo> @jerkhov_ truth

[2:05:05] <sgtbloopface> @dukenux pretty sure he does yeah
[2:05:06] <Pookiedaexzile> His bottom lip never moves
[2:05:08] <+MrTurtleThief> @peachy996 true her backstory is cool
[2:05:08] <$SGrim> I forgot how much they both suck
[2:05:11] <ape_hawk> TWO WEEKS
[2:05:13] <RetributionP> what class did pat choose
[2:05:13] <%justnathan18> Because no one played andromeda
[2:05:14] <$lotharrio> @dukenux They pay better than legitimate places I'm pretty sure.
[2:05:15] <%fat_burtreynolds> Gah I need to get ftl on my switch
[2:05:17] <peachy996> Miranda, Jack and Zaeed are probably the humans I like most
[2:05:18] <JetpackMcQuack> I fucking hate aliens now
[2:05:20] <%watts121> @jerkhov_ Cuz we were too busy hearing about how SHE WAS TRAINED BY ASARI COMMANDOS!
[2:05:23] <%SveriSageAdvice> god the facial animations are so uncanny
[2:05:33] <NitronStreams> Shepard has a LOT of brain damage
[2:05:33] <ioci2112> yeah you fucks did that
[2:05:35] <%RubberFistFight> >no parents SHEP POD PERSON CONFIRMED
[2:05:36] <+AmericanSkidd> Miranda as a person is fine, a bit cold, but fine
[2:05:37] <UnImprest> "we all saw your burnt peepee"
[2:05:37] <%fat_burtreynolds> Hey Pat, I got into the breach on my switch dude. Shits so ******** cash
[2:05:38] <%democrazyyy> look at his teeths
[2:05:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> I REFUSED TO DIE

[2:05:43] <+StoopKid241> an attack staged by Cerberys
[2:05:45] <dukenux> its been... 2 hours since we recovered you
[2:05:46] <TourettesPlays> This part is becuase the original ME2 wouldn't import your decision on saving the council
[2:05:46] <Josef_Stryker> AND IT'S YOUR FAULT FUCKERS
[2:05:47] <+D00msDayDan> jacob's lips are so weird
[2:05:47] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU CAUSED IT
[2:05:48] <+Buzzkill983> Oh yeah, that was Cerberus XD
[2:05:52] <thelonechris> Teeth
[2:05:54] <%RubberFistFight> @SveriSageAdvice yeah they were never designed for high def

[2:10:34] <Parapattern> It REALLY is

[2:10:35] <Ids560> hilarious
[2:10:36] <$KetsuoTaberu> mmmmm doubt

[2:10:42] <+athuramn> I thought you were playing renegade for 2? @patstaresat
[2:10:43] <televisedrevolting> This Tim guy is kinda presumptuous.
[2:10:45] <Jaysky> Cerberus is a big big racist org
[2:10:46] <%Ne1son> and also Cerberus also did nothing wrong
[2:10:46] <CheeseBurgerHelper> like cartoonishly evil
[2:10:46] <spawnzie> they're actually MORE evil than you believe

[2:10:53] <nuane> "Cerberus did nothing wrong" CEO of Cerberus
[2:10:55] <AngryAsian5> "You caused my horrible tragic backstory you asshole!" LUL
[2:10:55] <Jetsfantasy> Blue Sharingan monkaS
[2:10:56] <ShadeNightz> "sleeping"
[2:10:59] <+Buzzkill983> Akuze was an inside job
[2:10:59] <peachy996> ASK JACK HOW EVIL CERBERUS IS
[2:11:01] <dukenux> ...the Grabbers
[2:11:01] <jorniev> This guy and udina are characters most failed with the LAMEST develoment in me3
[2:11:02] <ShadeNightz> literally fucking dead
[2:11:03] <TourettesPlays> I love the way Tim pronounces the word "Yumanity"
[2:11:09] <+AmericanSkidd> Cerberus does EVERYTING WRONG
[2:11:16] <+moondog_> martin sheen doing some good work here
[2:11:20] <+bugz_munny> Yuman
[2:11:22] <ScreamLord> TIM is basically Dr. Claw after taking a throat lozenge
[2:11:23] <%AncelDeLambert> I never noticed his silly accent
[2:11:26] <+jerkhov> ok but cerberus is a cool name
[2:11:26] <yourliteraldog> Join our Space Miltia
[2:11:27] <%Ne1son> He's is super right about that though
[2:11:29] <JetpackMcQuack> Kidnapping kids is our schtick
[2:11:30] <spawnzie> gotta protcc yumanity by doing that inhumane shit
[2:11:31] <$antibonehurtingjuice> uh no he wasnt
[2:11:36] <%Gamblitz> Fight for the lost!
[2:11:36] <%fat_burtreynolds> … The Hunter Gatherers
[2:11:37] <%QueequegTheater> My dad pronounces HU sounds the same way
[2:11:40] <%RubberFistFight> @iosephe the creators' came up with some explanation about how shepard and his squaddies were genetically resistant to a specific thing, it was a big goddamn bullshit handwave.
[2:11:41] <Oxybe> not meman, yuman
[2:11:43] <+InternetShis> Yumanity
[2:11:44] <CheeseBurgerHelper> Its weird how Cerberus starts ME2 as a small pro-human faction and then suddenly in ME3 they're a military superpower
[2:11:45] <yourliteraldog> YUMANITY
[2:11:47] <+gregpivo> The TIM twist in ME3 is super interesting and implemented like dogshit
[2:11:47] <nuane> yumanity
[2:11:50] <+bugz_munny> yumaaaaaaanity
[2:11:50] <%bassoontyphoon> Are we Yuman?? Or are we Yancers??

[2:12:12] <spawnzie> like Prince?
[2:12:13] <%RubberFistFight> @gregpivo I like to think that he was like that the entire time.
[2:12:15] <Parapattern> That was Joker
[2:12:15] <yourliteraldog> We need an ubermench
[2:12:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> They DO understand fear.
[2:12:16] <+jerkhov> daft punk pronounces it as yuman
[2:12:17] <+InternetShis> "Shepard, you can fuck aliens with the best of them. Kill the machines."
[2:12:17] <cellaccount> respect that
[2:12:17] <Lamokmok> You're space Batman?

[2:12:25] <%Ravioli_Ronin> They made such a big fuss about Eden Prime that it’s weird they wouldn’t care about that happening again
[2:12:27] <stantheman_97> actually joker killed one
[2:12:31] <ape_hawk> technically, joker killed sovereign, so they should be going after him
[2:12:32] <%CalderGaming> i mean technically joker killed- "we have him here too" oh ok
[2:12:32] <dukenux> hes like captain Brennan in Departed in this
[2:12:32] <Mr_Britannia> Did Pat save the Council or not?
[2:12:40] <GManx0> Wouldnt a dead symbol be better
[2:12:41] <%QueequegTheater> He did
[2:12:42] <yourliteraldog> Shepard your cock is huge and ur so cool
[2:12:43] <%RubberFistFight> it's robo-poo now
[2:12:43] <+gregpivo> @gregpivo I think he was. But the ending "You have to fight it, TIM!" BLAM is lame
[2:12:47] <LluthyY> yeah pat saved the council
[2:12:47] <%bassoontyphoon> Stood for yumanity by letting yumans die for the council
[2:12:50] <televisedrevolting> Vanish me poopum

[2:13:18] <%justnathan18> You trust Jacob and he gets someone else pregnant.
[2:13:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> Your best agent shouldn't be a traitor.

[2:13:44] <+bugz_munny> yeah they got a camera man this time
[2:13:44] <spawnzie> how am I supposed to trust someone who tries thish hard to impress me?
[2:13:44] <+Kaiserzelcor> One of the best designed scene settings in gaming history
[2:13:47] <+ryuguitarfreak> IT'S THE BEST
[2:13:48] <+CursedNobleman> look at the mis-en-place
[2:13:50] <Flame_Water> this is what peak performance looks like

[2:13:54] <$Faustgesicht> This is so sexy aethesticly tbh
[2:13:56] <%RubberFistFight> I love how there's never any explanation for whatever bullshit that star in the background is doing.
[2:13:56] <cellaccount> a choice of freedom
[2:14:01] <%LumberjackJack> Cinematography is fucking amazing in ME2. Shame the person who did the work in ME2 moved on and didn't stay for 3
[2:14:01] <%dekkitout> Ya know, it's too bad you can't hang up on him
[2:14:05] <+jerkhov> theme of money

[2:15:47] <spawnzie> we'll bang ok?
[2:15:48] <%watts121> Yep Champion. Biotics in ME2 is more about chaining explosions to get the good damage, which requires comboing abilities faster.
[2:15:52] <peachy996> AGH SHE'S SUCH A COLD BITCH
[2:15:53] <%QueequegTheater> Pat why are you being paragon
[2:15:53] <+jerkhov> jiyuDaigasm

[2:15:59] <MrPandastic> Shepard killed a fucking REAPER, I'm pretty sure he's capable.
[2:16:03] <Pookiedaexzile> "So uh....You ever sit face"
[2:16:04] <$Solid_Stro> Thanks for bringing me back to life, but stay out of my way fucker sabert14Gun
[2:16:04] <tanarath> Did they tone down miranda's assets?
[2:16:08] <stantheman_97> racism?
[2:16:08] <%ScottishMadJacko> Fair
[2:16:09] <%Ravioli_Ronin> YOU DIDNT WANT TO WAIT FOR THOSE PEOPLE THO
[2:16:09] <ioci2112> photo mode: exclusively added to take pictures of miranda's ass
[2:16:09] <cellaccount> 👂 what did ya say

[2:16:12] <+athuramn> nice
[2:16:12] <Pookiedaexzile> ASS ET
[2:16:14] <%MidnightBurst12> he's too nice
[2:16:14] <%fat_burtreynolds> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm lose my life in your station, more liek
[2:16:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> I wonder how long it will take to get the "Fix Miranda's face" mod in legendary edition.
[2:16:16] <+patrickng714> because Pat is a good boy
[2:16:17] <+Buzzkill983> It feels icky pooie to be mean
[2:16:17] <+ratchetex> "I believe in what the space kkk stands for"
[2:16:17] <TourettesPlays> @QueequegTheater being mean is bad
[2:16:18] <$LightningLynx89> Pat is just too god of a person
[2:16:18] <SaltyAzteca> Pat is a good natured person man dude
[2:16:19] <%LumberjackJack> It's muscle memory
[2:16:20] <+titansloth93> I don't want to be mean to the polygons
[2:16:20] <%Monkeyweed21> I BELIEVE IN TERRORISM
[2:16:20] <%RubberFistFight> Literally the same reason I'll never go a renegade run, i just can't.
[2:16:22] <T_Sasquatch> Soy
[2:16:23] <$antibonehurtingjuice> renegade in 2/3 gets fucking evil
[2:16:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> Oh, they didn't edit out her camel toe.
[2:16:26] <%Varlinator> She believes in Nazi Science
[2:16:27] <huskarl_zap> NOPAT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:16:27] <+jerkhov> they didn't tone it down they just removed some gratuitous camera shots
[2:16:28] <+athuramn> pat simps on stream
[2:16:28] <NitronStreams> Paragon cuz FUCK CERBERUS
[2:16:29] <%pokefan9956> why is her lip syncing so bad
[2:16:30] <%DJFakie> Good feels good @patstaresat
[2:16:31] <peachy996> You meet a more racist version of Miranda later on in 3
[2:16:34] <Parapattern> Being bad is NOT nice
[2:16:34] <dukenux> Not even being a jerk to get some Renegade points?
[2:16:36] <$Solid_Stro> Pat can’t help but be a good person, just like real life...... sabert14Box
[2:16:37] <%justnathan18> Paragon means mooooore assets
[2:16:38] <RetributionP> Pat is Canadian. remember nice is a predisposition
[2:16:38] <peachy996> But that's for a later day
[2:16:40] <CheeseBurgerHelper> Honestly its so difficult to be anything but paragon in ME2 and 3, especially because renegade in ME3 is so vile and evil
[2:16:41] <Ids560> I hate Miranda way more than Ashley
[2:16:45] <yourliteraldog> It's like a smooth camel toe
[2:16:51] <cellaccount> big peen

[2:16:59] <%toolofparanoia> Paragon just feels right in ME2 except the renegade quick time events... those are baller
[2:17:00] <+InternetShis> @tanarath No, they just changed camera angles so we don't have a colonoscopy every 30 seconds
[2:17:02] <%RubberFistFight> @jerkhov_ They shouldn't have removed shit. It was fine the way ti was.
[2:17:02] <%shadowsofpain> I like that she just tells you
[2:17:04] <%kewlmyc> Thanks Miranda! :D
[2:17:04] <%castlerock42> That is some honesty.
[2:17:04] <+AmericanSkidd> This bitch...

[2:17:06] <%Varlinator> Ok, Heisenberg!

[2:17:16] <+D00msDayDan> but the priiize
[2:17:17] <$lotharrio> I already have a chip in my shoulder. Don't want one in my brain.
[2:17:19] <%justnathan18> Its super funny to cheat on Ashley with Miranda
[2:17:19] <ape_hawk> no, she cant
[2:17:19] <Jaysky> @toolofparanoia How about "Goodbye"?
[2:17:20] <dd44dostivei> never forget that she wanted to enslave you
[2:17:21] <trueGarnish> crush with butt

[2:17:49] <%shadowsofpain> Friend no, sex object yes
[2:17:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> She was a teenager.
[2:17:51] <%fat_burtreynolds> Can you make me a Grilled cheese psaSkelmo
[2:17:51] <+Shockrates20XX> I *love* that she literally isn't as good as she thinks she is.
[2:17:53] <$Solid_Stro> You legal?
[2:17:58] <$SGrim> "I was born at a young age," Miranda Lawson
[2:18:00] <+InternetShis> What's your biotic amp, Aussie?
[2:18:00] <QuestlordJake> they really nailed the cold and blunt personality
[2:18:00] <spuginky> yep
[2:18:00] <huskarl_zap> she isn't a humanbean
[2:18:01] <AdamLon4> Illusive Man just wanted some barely legal pussy
[2:18:01] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> WEAR HER DOWN
[2:18:03] <%MrBorisMakarov> GIVE ME ZAEED
[2:18:03] <rekinom> GET ME SOME BLUSSY STAT
[2:18:05] <ape_hawk> "hey archangel, can you snipe these two ashleys?"
[2:18:06] <%RubberFistFight> @InternetShis The only people who actually had a problem with it and weren't just bandwagoning for clout, were people who weren't going to play the game in the first place. Caving to them was cowardice.
[2:18:07] <Profmcstevie> WHY ARE NONE OF YOU BLUE....OR WREX
[2:18:08] <JoshyJay> man humans suck so hard
[2:18:11] <%Varlinator> They suck so bad
[2:18:12] <%ScottishMadJacko> good choice
[2:18:12] <yourliteraldog> Is illusive man Jeffery Epstien?
[2:18:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> I love the idea of Shepard just talking to Joker and going "We need some fucking aliens on this ship Joker."
[2:18:13] <%Dfreddy8> Humans are too plain
[2:18:14] <cellaccount> cerbrs
[2:18:14] <%anticrust> Jacob at least acts like an ok person here
[2:18:15] <TheIronBrass> She's still way better than Ash
[2:18:16] <dukenux> aliens on a Cerberus space station? LUL
[2:18:16] <CheeseBurgerHelper> The humans suck hardcore, get some aliens up in this ship
[2:18:17] <stantheman_97> i like miranda as a character
[2:18:19] <%QueequegTheater> GET ME SOME OF THAT SAMARA DICK
[2:18:20] <$lotharrio> Well the important thing is to favor Jack over Miranda on all things. HahaBaby
[2:18:21] <peachy996> No shit idiot
[2:18:22] <Grandnatics> Yeah good job with that
[2:18:22] <TourettesPlays> Its pretty great how this game lets you take take take everything from Cerberus and end up giving nothing in return
[2:18:22] <+NeonLight> When kasumi tho
[2:18:23] <blackjack8182> Zaeed is cool
[2:18:23] <OldManDeckardCain> calm down your raging oikophobia LUL
[2:18:24] <$SGrim> Sure thing, cheater
[2:18:26] <%justnathan18> Miranda is 35, how long has she worked for Illusive Man?
[2:18:27] <dd44dostivei> literally no character beyond bonability
[2:18:31] <MagmaRam> Humans fuckin blow
[2:18:32] <%bassoontyphoon> The only good human companion is Kasumi
[2:18:36] <Blank9> kasumi and zaeed are both good
[2:18:38] <KeiPrime> holy shit i forgot about zaeed
[2:18:39] <Jaysky> These are some of my least favorite humans, but Jacob is unremarkable
[2:18:39] <LeotheHuntsman> I cant believe Pat is so hateful of Women and POC
[2:18:39] <Justlaxy> Miranda having an Australian accent didn't help her much.
[2:18:40] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Jacob is just New Kaiden
[2:18:40] <hat_under_bread> @Too_Much_Nukie And then Joker bargains for a hot cyborg lady.
[2:18:42] <+AmericanSkidd> cant get to omega fast enough
[2:18:42] <%anticrust> PIRACY!
[2:18:43] <%captain_thickthighs> so an American colony then?
[2:18:45] <T_Sasquatch> Jacob SHOULD be cool but man ...
[2:18:47] <Grandnatics> Miranda is cool in concept but doesn't go anywhere
[2:18:47] <Jaysky> Wait no
[2:18:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> Zaeed is good as a "Tired and old Shepard"
[2:18:49] <%MidnightBurst12> Pirates
[2:18:50] <$LightningLynx89> At least Jacob is honest in this game
[2:18:50] <%Gamblitz> Blackwater..
[2:18:51] <Blank9> zaeed has great stories
[2:18:51] <+InternetShis> But did they have RGB lighting?
[2:18:52] <peachy996> Miranda gets better as the game goes on and obviously after her loyalty mission is done
[2:18:54] <sendart> YAR HAR
[2:18:54] <TheApeGatsby> but the priiiiiiize
[2:18:55] <%dekkitout> So a discount spectre
[2:18:58] <%LumberjackJack> Privateers?
[2:18:59] <cellaccount> independent
[2:18:59] <%Dfreddy8> The only good human is a dead human
[2:19:01] <ape_hawk> @Ravioli_Ronin dont insult kaiden like that
[2:19:01] <$SGrim> @lotharrio Better yet, tell them both to shut the fuck up, the go to Samara for Biotic support.
[2:19:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Garrus 2
[2:19:02] <%fat_burtreynolds> They have an OnlyFans
[2:19:03] <%QueequegTheater> Just like you disavowed knowledge of FemShep's pussy you cheater
[2:19:03] <nuane> so like Species but less cool
[2:19:04] <BenLanBen> private military NotLikeThis
[2:19:06] <%Varlinator> Corsair = Diet Spectres
[2:19:06] <Jaysky> These are some of my favorite humans is what I meant, but Jacob is unremarkable
[2:19:06] <%capnbeefs> Space privateers, neat
[2:19:06] <$SGrim> then*
[2:19:07] <+NeonLight> So Alliance didnt get Spectres so they made their own
[2:19:07] <%bassoontyphoon> Priiiiiiize
[2:19:07] <huskarl_zap> Pirates
[2:19:08] <%justnathan18> Jacob has less personality than Kaiden. At least he has anger issues
[2:19:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> Here's Garrus 2.
[2:19:10] <%chance_h> PJSalt1000 Mass effect does Lawful / chaotic evil better than most D&D games. Too bad they made all the humans lawful Stupid
[2:19:10] <Pookiedaexzile> GARRUS 2
[2:19:12] <ioci2112> so you joined a terrorist organization, good idea you fuck
[2:19:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> Worse Garrus.
[2:19:13] <$LightningLynx89> Literal Privateers
[2:19:14] <dukenux> oh he has Garrus problem
[2:19:15] <T_Sasquatch> @bassoontyphoon jack is cool once u do her loyalty mission
[2:19:18] <Grandnatics> Wait Jacob is a radicalized extranet nerd?
[2:19:23] <MagmaRam> Is it possible to have an ME2 ending where everyone but Jacob lives
[2:19:26] <+InternetShis> Human, boring, token Garrus
[2:19:28] <+gregpivo> Miranda's ass did a lot of heavy lifting trying to make me like her when I played this
[2:19:29] <%justnathan18> Corsair is Cyclops' Dad
[2:19:30] <+AmericanSkidd> and then kill the survivors
[2:19:30] <hat_under_bread> LUL
[2:19:30] <PirateMike_> Jack is great too
[2:19:31] <+Ghufufin> crazy eyes
[2:19:34] <%twistedj3ster> Ouch
[2:19:34] <cellaccount> cerberus is build differnt
[2:19:35] <%dave323dave> and all of that gets dropped in me3
[2:19:36] <spawnzie> and do some horrible shit to innocents along the way
[2:19:37] <dukenux> "cant do shit by rules, GOTTA BLOW UP PEOPLE"
[2:19:37] <%bassoontyphoon> @t_sasquatch I can’t believe I forgot her
[2:19:38] <%LumberjackJack> True LUL
[2:19:39] <+Shubreaker> SIR?
[2:19:42] <%ScottishMadJacko> good point
[2:19:47] <%watts121> Jacob joined space isis...

[2:19:49] <+bugz_munny> the sheen screen
[2:19:49] <%Varlinator> You've wasted your life, Jacob
[2:19:51] <peachy996> Ahh this theme oh and you cut it off
[2:19:52] <$Solid_Stro> Actually I’m doing the job, sir sabert14Gun
[2:19:53] <%justnathan18> BOOBS
[2:19:54] <Ids560> The game pretending cerberus doesn't suck for an extended period of time is so weird
[2:19:54] <peachy996> jerk
[2:19:54] <Jaysky> Loading is so fast
[2:19:55] <Broken_Sonex> @gregpivo Her ass REALLY helps
[2:19:55] <%JamesCorck> The weirdest Mission Complete screen ever.

[2:20:11] <BeastlyWhale> no alien cum clues
[2:20:12] <nuane> I order you to stay on the ship
[2:20:12] <+InternetShis> @magmaram There is a lot of math checking done in the suicide mission if you wanna go look at a flowchart
[2:20:15] <%pokefan9956> why is the lip syncing so bad in this one when it was fine in 1
[2:20:18] <$Faustgesicht> Shoot the loading screens are really smooth. Shame
[2:20:20] <buhbuhboat> Of course Cerberus operatives are gonna tell you that Cerberus is cool
[2:20:22] <%fat_burtreynolds> Normandy ship go BRRRR

[2:20:29] <jorniev> HAVE WE TALKED ABOUT HOW GOOD THE MUSIC IS?
[2:20:30] <dukenux> @grandnatics naw he got tired "regulations keeping him down" like Garrus
[2:20:31] <%QueequegTheater> They didn't even jizz all over anything!
[2:20:31] <James_Quivers> that loading was instanteous, holy shit
[2:20:34] <hat_under_bread> @Ids560 You can chalk it up to being surrounded by Cerberus people trying their absolute best to not piss Shepherd off.
[2:20:35] <Flame_Water> how do you go from this to andromeda?!

[2:21:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Funfact: That person you meet on this planet was originally recruited on this planet, but then they changed their minds because they wanted the players to get to know Jacob and Miranda.
[2:21:13] <%Treuan> But you get the BEST aliens there
[2:21:13] <dukenux> Omegalul

[2:21:34] <%JamesCorck> And then replace Miranda with Alien.
[2:21:36] <%RubberFistFight> Yeah you're forced to run around with the galaxy's second-best ass and Space Discount Kanye for a little while.
[2:21:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> Changing their minds so you can't recruit Tali here will always be lame of Bioware.
[2:21:37] <%LumberjackJack> Omega. You'll get Zaeed ASAP then get either Archangel/Mordin after
[2:21:38] <%fat_burtreynolds> Gib Tali
[2:21:39] <%toolofparanoia> GO TO OMEGA FIRST AND GET GARRUS

[2:21:57] <IndoorSitup> @patstaresat LEVEL UP MIRANDA
[2:22:02] <jorniev> NOT GARRUS FIRST
[2:22:05] <$lotharrio> Key bindings
[2:22:05] <%saadi90> Get Kasumi in Citadel and zaeed in omega. Problem solved. Then get Mordin and Garrus
[2:22:08] <%Ravioli_Ronin> This is just straight ALIENS music
[2:22:09] <%shurtal> key bindings?
[2:22:10] <nuane> key bindings?
[2:22:12] <%LumberjackJack> Using a PS5 controller? Holding square swaps between your last 2 weapons
[2:22:13] <T_Sasquatch> I still can't believe me:andromeda was treated with such disrespect
[2:22:14] <+athuramn> controller support not native on pc @patstaresat
[2:22:14] <%QueequegTheater> @IndoorSitup why
[2:22:14] <%watts121> Once you get to the Normandy you can get the DLC  weapons which are great.
[2:22:16] <peachy996> I know about Zaeed but how does Grunt figure into the Dialogue of Archangel's mission?
[2:22:18] <jorniev> WAIT PHOTO MODE!?
[2:22:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> There's a lot of good shotguns in this game but the default one is trash.
[2:22:20] <$lotharrio> Options. Keybindings
[2:22:28] <%ScottishMadJacko> @anticrust seems fine, just nothing abut me3 citadels dlc

[2:22:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Better start looking for ammo
[2:22:47] <+AmericanSkidd> Take pictures of Miranda's butt
[2:22:49] <RrenKrieg> the shuriken is pretty good in ME3
[2:22:50] <%RubberFistFight> @T_Sasquatch I still can't believe they spent over 100 million dollars and created a shitty, bug-ridden mess and then blamed the players for the bad reception.
[2:22:50] <%logoth_> Jesus shit damn
[2:22:51] <%fat_burtreynolds> Me1 had a fat cone for the shotgun spray but this looks just sad
[2:22:54] <tattleworm> literally one guy
[2:22:54] <%BubbaRands> but have you seen her butt?
[2:22:54] <LluthyY> soothing whales

[2:23:15] <%twistedj3ster> Larger ass +2
[2:23:16] <%justnathan18> For the hottest lady in the universe, Miranda sure has a big ass forehead
[2:23:17] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Just auto-level the schmucks tbh
[2:23:20] <PirateMike_> She looks derpy in this
[2:23:23] <Profmcstevie> Whole squad, as she will promptly become intimate with THE BENCH
[2:23:26] <%AFellowDegen> WARP ALL THE WAY
[2:23:30] <Broken_Sonex> Where's the level chain to maker her ass bigger
[2:23:31] <Coystick> One cheek is paragon THE OTHER IS RENEGADE
[2:23:33] <%Gamblitz> she looks based all the time
[2:23:33] <Grandnatics> Pat do you think that the gameplay improvements justifies thermal clips wrecking the lore
[2:23:35] <+D00msDayDan> man i feel like playing ME2 on insanity again, but don't feel like going through all the non-shooty parts of it for the 4000th time
[2:23:36] <%ScottishMadJacko> @anticrust no problem
[2:23:37] <%Deebo305> Miranda is super good imo
[2:23:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Miranda has always looked like Chucky to me
[2:23:42] <%fat_burtreynolds> sbfpScared how bout dem feets doe
[2:23:45] <+Peacefrog7> she does look to have a wider face model in 2
[2:23:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> Behind the crates I think there's a thing.
[2:23:53] <+liquidzr0> spooky noises intensifies
[2:23:55] <James_Quivers> oberheating is lame

[2:24:05] <%Gamblitz> aliens reference
[2:24:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> There's not.
[2:24:08] <Essixian> @justnathan18 She needs a big forehead to maintain balance with her giant ass
[2:24:08] <$LightningLynx89> Miranda unironically is great gameplay wise
[2:24:10] <ape_hawk> its a good thing miranda has such a huge ass to warm the bench by herself
[2:24:11] <$Solid_Stro> Love this game’s combat

[2:24:56] <$KetsuoTaberu> If you just pan your view horizontally across the screen, you find most items in the level very easily in ME2
[2:24:56] <+LionKagura> LUL
[2:24:57] <%MelBrooksKA> BECAUSE IT'S FUN
[2:24:59] <buhbuhboat> Miranda is like the best squadmate gameplay wise, can take down all health types and gives whole squad extra health and weapon damage

[2:26:06] <%Deebo305> Its a shotgun not a sniper rifle
[2:26:06] <%QueequegTheater> SCHOLAR
[2:26:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Just headbutt the problem
[2:26:08] <susukouhai> bork busted
[2:26:10] <+RowenCleric> i forgot all the robots
[2:26:11] <Jaysky> It's so satisfying to break their pieces, and the shot CHUNK EFFECTS
[2:26:12] <%shurtal> Whats the justification of ROBOT DOG
[2:26:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> I'm now remembering the upgrade in 3 that lets charge regen your health.
[2:26:19] <MichelangeloStark> cute puppers
[2:26:19] <$LightningLynx89> ROBO DOG!
[2:26:23] <%QueequegTheater> @Deebo305 shotgun effective range is 100 meters
[2:26:24] <PirateMike_> I think you meet tali here don't you?
[2:26:28] <%LumberjackJack> Someone with AI Hacking maxed out. HMMMMMMMMM...
[2:26:28] <Jaysky> @shurtal FAST ROBO
[2:26:33] <ne0bunny> I forgot there was doggo mechs
[2:26:33] <Pookiedaexzile> I like to think That's what Shepard was doing in 1 with Barrier
[2:26:36] <$KetsuoTaberu> the shuriken is hot garbage
[2:26:37] <$Solid_Stro> Robo Zangiefs
[2:26:37] <%Ravioli_Ronin> @shurtal we have robot dogs irl now
[2:26:38] <%ScottishMadJacko> I hate the smgs in this game, except the locust
[2:26:43] <%Gamblitz> they look like robot houndeyes from Half life
[2:26:47] <skyentombment> hey guys, has Pat looked with his special eyes yet?
[2:26:48] <Broken_Sonex> @T_Sasquatch Like they give her sis her face. @T_Sasquatch
[2:26:49] <+D00msDayDan> i never liked how this game only showed the radar in the menu
[2:26:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Guns in this game are permanent upgrades. When you find/buy a new gun everyone can use it. With one notable exception.
[2:26:58] <AthenaAegis> RoboGief: Dead or alive, you're getting the borger slobber Kappa
[2:26:59] <peachy996> I never really used SMGS either
[2:27:00] <+pally_din> Yeah the SMG's can be pretty rough
[2:27:05] <IndoorSitup> Theres only one good SMG in this entire game
[2:27:12] <%shurtal> @Ravioli_Ronin Yeah, but OUR rob dogs have a dorsal mounted grabber, these have got.......nothing but mass?
[2:27:12] <dukenux> i stuck to the pistol
[2:27:15] <Pookiedaexzile> I also like thinking He learned Biotic Charge from Wrex
[2:27:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> The only good SMG is the one in the Kasumi DLC.
[2:27:18] <stormhawk9891> Locust is the only good SMG by virtue of actually being able to hit stuff
[2:27:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> Sasuga Bioware.
[2:27:29] <Jaysky> A nice hack minigame imo
[2:27:30] <Grandnatics> Did you just loot the dead
[2:27:30] <spawnzie> HACKERMAN
[2:27:32] <peachy996> Yeah but even with the Locust I'll take literally any other gun over an SMG
[2:27:38] <%Agami23> this hacking minigame seems alot better than digital frogger
[2:27:43] <Jaysky> Big big same
[2:27:43] <peachy996> Robo Doggos
[2:27:44] <$Solid_Stro> Yay, dead people’s money sabert14Comfy
[2:27:46] <%Ravioli_Ronin> @shurtal fair point; probly just patrol or smth? Limited use but makes sense
[2:27:48] <%postalnerd787> charge is pretty fun
[2:27:48] <%captainpodock> God damn it, I had to watch the Bruins lose and I'm late to an ME stream?! Fuck!
[2:27:49] <dashmatt> This robo dog is compromising us

[2:27:52] <peachy996> Fenrir Mechs
[2:27:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> Now do you see why you're a DBZ character?

[2:28:35] <RetributionP> a rule in that mini game is that the lines never cross so you can visually kinda see
[2:28:37] <dukenux> HIP
[2:28:38] <%shurtal> @Ravioli_Ronin these are just "we want varren enemies, but on planets with no varren"

[2:30:30] <%bassoontyphoon> Jesus
[2:30:31] <LluthyY> no pat..., its a mystery~
[2:30:31] <+gespenst25> didn't the quarian armour not happen until they'd been on their ships for hundreds of years?
[2:30:31] <TioXyco> but tali's doesn't look like geth. and some other don't either
[2:30:31] <+athuramn> real 5heads in chat
[2:30:32] <%heartlesshealer> at least it's a good detail
[2:30:32] <%RubberFistFight> @Kingtut9009 it was always visible.
[2:30:34] <T_Sasquatch> Honestly i never noticed that but yea duh
[2:30:36] <PirateMike_> LUL
[2:30:41] <%fat_burtreynolds> Tali’s VA kinda sounds like the girl from the netflix castlevania.
[2:30:41] <%Deft_Thought> Man, did the timeskip happen just so that you'd feel like less of a creep for being able to mack on Tali
[2:30:43] <+HelloImTom08> Human squad mates DansGame
[2:30:44] <susukouhai> tbf Prazza sucked ass too
[2:30:45] <peachy996> Trade Tali for Jacob
[2:30:47] <Lamokmok> Miranda is ass. 90%
[2:30:48] <Zalapski> god, quarians are worthless except for tali
[2:30:50] <karl_rex> How did Cerberus get their hands on N7 armor?

[2:30:56] <$Solid_Stro> Humans shotoEww
[2:30:57] <peachy996> Prazza is an idiot
[2:31:00] <Jaysky> @Kingtut9009 Only visible in 2-3, but I like the face
[2:31:00] <+pally_din> I feel like they had to know the new squadmates suck if they dropped Tali in on the first mission
[2:31:01] <+HelloImTom08> @Deft_Thought two years
[2:31:02] <%anticrust> PAGE
[2:31:02] <%QueequegTheater> @fat_burtreynolds because they're both supposed to be Romani
[2:31:08] <%Nobrev> who said you could talk jacob
[2:31:11] <$Solid_Stro> Manthings shotoEww
[2:31:12] <ape_hawk> being a paragon in this game should give you a halo to mimic renegades scar effect
[2:31:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> Time isn't stopped while you do this.
[2:31:13] <%anticrust> HI PAGE
[2:31:14] <+Ropcord> pidge
[2:31:15] <Sp3ctre48> Tali was already 22 in ME1, it's not like it was that weird to begin with
[2:31:16] <jorniev> PAIIIGE
[2:31:18] <MrPandastic> Can we hang out with the quarians instead? they seem cool.
[2:31:20] <dukenux> Miranda is 90% pure ass
[2:31:24] <Essixian> @gespenst25 They were already spacefaring by the time they made the geth, so they'd already have developed those suits to protect them from non-native environments.
[2:31:24] <Parapattern> How happy is Gief?
[2:31:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> OH MAN THAT ROBOT BUGGED OUT
[2:31:28] <quipquest1> Isn't KOTOR's best companion, Jolee Bindo, a human?
[2:31:28] <%RubberFistFight> @gespenst25 Yes. Initially they didn't have the immunological issues they have now, but generations away from their planet on sterile space-faring vessels turned their immune systems into cheesecloth.
[2:31:32] <$Faustgesicht> Oh Piage is back? Nice!
[2:31:34] <%DizzyGunner> how does anyone know if tali is cute? YOU CANT SEE HER
[2:31:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> Use overload on them.
[2:31:53] <Broken_Sonex> @Sp3ctre48 Yeah people like to think she's younger than she really is it's weird

[2:32:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Shotgun is Spread

[2:32:27] <%Deebo305> Use overload on them
[2:32:28] <ape_hawk> use overload on tali's face
[2:32:29] <%logoth_> The mere act of walking must give miranda a wedgie
[2:32:30] <%QueequegTheater> Try overload on their shields
[2:32:31] <%LumberjackJack> But have you tried overload, tho?
[2:32:31] <%templar010> But Pat you should use it. Overload. On their shields.
[2:32:31] <stormhawk9891> Pat use overload
[2:32:32] <Pookiedaexzile> "THe WOMAN"
[2:32:32] <Grandnatics> What kind of commander of is Tali that her squad runs ahead
[2:32:32] <+D00msDayDan> but what if she used it more
[2:32:33] <%templar010> USE IT.
[2:32:34] <$Solid_Stro> c4sageLUL c4sageLUL c4sageLUL
[2:32:34] <+gregpivo> Miranda's flexing her buttcheeks for god's sake
[2:32:35] <+Huderga> "the women"
[2:32:37] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Miranda’s here to girl boss gaslight gatekeep
[2:32:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> You should use overload on them
[2:32:40] <AllenDeadman> y'all
[2:32:40] <MichelangeloStark> @dizzygunner excuse us for liking the person within instead of caring aboit a person's looks
[2:32:41] <%RubberFistFight> @Broken_Sonex wait what are people saying is weird?
[2:32:42] <%Dfreddy8> USE IT.
[2:32:43] <IndoorSitup> Yepppp
[2:32:43] <Jaysky> I dislike shottys in this game
[2:32:44] <+pally_din> I like the default pistol though
[2:32:45] <+HelloImTom08> use overload on your penis
[2:32:45] <Pookiedaexzile> SHOT GUN IS SPREAD
[2:32:49] <AllenDeadman> can y'all follow basic onstructions?
[2:32:53] <karl_rex> God ME3 feels so unpolished
[2:32:54] <srv4254> drop your overload
[2:32:54] <+AmericanSkidd> Omega has a way better shotgun for sale
[2:32:54] <+sermittens> @PatStaresAt  your stuck with that thing for a while
[2:32:54] <%Agami23> again, i gotta wonder, why is there a whale??
[2:32:55] <jorniev> KROGAN make the best shotguns
[2:32:56] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Eventually you get a krogan shotgun that's less a shotgun and more of a short-range railgun
[2:32:57] <+MightyDuckShoes> The vvöman
[2:33:00] <%Deebo305> Imagine bad default weapons
[2:33:03] <stormhawk9891> Eviserator all the way baby
[2:33:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> When you get the scimitar shotgun in this it's just an instant upgrade.
[2:33:05] <Sp3ctre48> Tali's probably only a commander because her dad is an admiral tbh
[2:33:06] <IndoorSitup> Replace the shotgun with a better one ASAP as possible
[2:33:06] <%Varlinator> It's no Geth Plasma that's for sure
[2:33:09] <%fat_burtreynolds> Spread your ass Gun LUL
[2:33:10] <cellaccount> can vanguard get level 3 weapons?
[2:33:11] <%RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater That weapon rocks
[2:33:13] <%MugenSandan> Wolves hunt in packs, Patrisen!
[2:33:14] <QuestlordJake> they all suck when you look back on how devastating they can be in 1
[2:33:15] <Broken_Sonex> @RubberFistFight That tali is super young in ME 1 when she was like 22 in that game
[2:33:17] <nuane> @DizzyGunner he has a good personality, nice ass, and she's only kinda racist against sapient robots. what more do you need?
[2:33:22] <%BubbaRands> I like when gun go *Pew Pew*
[2:33:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> Oh yeah the geth plasma shotgun isn't given to you for free in the legendary edition.
[2:33:32] <huskarl_zap> Is the Asari shotgun in 2 or only three?
[2:33:33] <Jaysky> Oh no not Prazza!
[2:33:38] <Pookiedaexzile> @fat_burtreynolds Now're  talkin
[2:33:38] <IndoorSitup> @thecallousking Thdy can get the Claymore
[2:33:44] <%DorianCreed> DorianCreed subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Apparently I got a second one of these when my browser refreshed? Also, the martial/marital thing was only semi-accidentally, as you fight enough for both
[2:33:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> 3 Only
[2:33:47] <+D00msDayDan> i wish there were more ymir fights in the game
[2:33:48] <+InternetShis> And then we can have a little baby
[2:33:48] <%RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight Oh, so the usual anti-sex puritans infantilising adult female characters, then.
[2:33:52] <Sp3ctre48> @huskarl_zap The disciple is in ME3
[2:34:03] <TourettesPlays> oh cool squad commands that they ignore half of the fucking time
[2:34:05] <peachy996> RIP Prazza, you were an idiot
[2:34:09] <+Totally_Not_Toby> and then let's immediately move somewhere else!
[2:34:10] <%LumberjackJack> Wow, get owned, scrubs
[2:34:10] <+EvilErickan> never liked the asari shot gun, like the aesthetic
[2:34:12] <Jaysky> She's fine

[2:34:25] <+AmericanSkidd> you did it real good guys good jon!
[2:34:26] <DatAsuna> AQAB
[2:34:26] <CheeseBurgerHelper> Quarians are awful infantry
[2:34:26] <Parapattern> Poor dudes
[2:34:27] <otakon17> GO FOR THE BUILDINGS PAT
[2:34:28] <%Varlinator> Prazza, you idiot!
[2:34:30] <peachy996> Haha Suck it Quarians
[2:34:30] <+D00msDayDan> thank god they never curve missiles like that against you
[2:34:33] <%captainpodock> Did Pat go to Omega yet?
[2:34:33] <moonmeh> quarians please
[2:34:34] <$antibonehurtingjuice> not really
[2:34:34] <Grandnatics> Quarians seem to not understand cover
[2:34:34] <otakon17> the crates in the yard all break
[2:34:35] <huskarl_zap> Damn the Disciple was near broke with its damage and range being the whole map.
[2:34:38] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Oof, that’s rough buddy
[2:34:38] <%Monkeyweed21> THAT GUY SPAWNED IN
[2:34:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> They do though.
[2:34:40] <%Gamblitz> Jacob is laughing all night
[2:34:41] <logothete2401> Damn they got wrecked
[2:34:41] <%maenos2> no wonder you loseres lost ot the geth

[2:34:42] <%Monkeyweed21> I SAW IT
[2:34:43] <KeiPrime> language
[2:34:44] <%logoth_> hey pat use overload
[2:34:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> YEYEYE
[2:34:46] <trueGarnish> LUL
[2:34:47] <+MightyDuckShoes> Isn't fighting robots their specialty?
[2:34:49] <dd44dostivei> lol ED 209 voice
[2:34:50] <SpaceGuntank> the Salarians probably stand a better chance at fighting than the Quarians LUL
[2:34:50] <%logoth_> did you use overload?? USE OVERLOAD
[2:34:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> OVERLOAD WILL TAKE OUT THEIR SHIELDS
[2:34:51] <ape_hawk> use overload
[2:34:53] <%pokefan9956> DONT WORRY MINORITIES. THE HUMANS ARE HERE TO HELP
[2:34:54] <%QueequegTheater> OVERLOAD WILL TAKE OUT THEIR SHIELDS
[2:34:56] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> She said she can kill any mech though
[2:34:56] <%RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight Same people that cost us Miranda butt shots. Fuck 'em. It's always morally correct to flip the bird at them.
[2:35:01] <$Solid_Stro> Remember to overload sabert14Sip
[2:35:05] <NitronStreams> why did Jacob sound so smug talking about how tough the enemy mech is?
[2:35:06] <otakon17> Overload for shields, Fire for Armor
[2:35:08] <%Ravioli_Ronin> “Those quatrains never stood a chance, but damn if that mech isn’t pog”
[2:35:09] <%Mekhet09> Your overload isn't good enough
[2:35:10] <quipquest1> Chat lied
[2:35:11] <CheeseBurgerHelper> It turns out when a single grazing shot on your suit will likely give you a lethal infection, you don't really make good infantry fighters
[2:35:11] <buhbuhboat> Jacob holding a gun he doesnt have in that cutscene
[2:35:15] <%ScottishMadJacko> remember, fast weapons are better for shields and barriers, slow for armour
[2:35:19] <%maenos2> PAT USE OVERLOAD
[2:35:21] <dashmatt> oh lawd he comin
[2:35:22] <%aWanderingKaivo> @MightyDuckShoes well I mean they did lose their homeworld to robots so
[2:35:24] <%luckysteak> too bad lift is not useful since he has shields AND armor
[2:35:27] <%JamesCorck> Bloody screen º3º so real!
[2:35:28] <Broken_Sonex> QUICK MIRANDA USE YOUR ASS THE CRUSH IT LIKE A WATERMELLON LIKE IN THOSE HOLO VIDS
[2:35:28] <Pookiedaexzile> CHARGE
[2:35:33] <Grandnatics> Charge it!
[2:35:34] <otakon17> he's USING overload
[2:35:35] <peachy996> Is it just me or is The Mech smaller?
[2:35:35] <Grandnatics> CHARGE
[2:35:36] <%fat_burtreynolds> Boot his Snoot
[2:35:36] <%AncelDeLambert> fire bullets are what's good against armor
[2:35:39] <%Varlinator> Garrus would've been able to take out those shields in one go, Miranda. You suck
[2:35:41] <dirtyh4rr1> if only he had something like a grenade launcher
[2:35:42] <jorniev> head butt it
[2:35:44] <Essixian> @RubberFistFight To be fair, those butt shots were pretty dumb
[2:35:45] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[2:35:46] <jorniev> YEAAAH

[2:35:51] <+AmericanSkidd> headshot kill is he best for those guys
[2:35:51] <%LumberjackJack> YEAH
[2:35:52] <%postalnerd787> too powerful
[2:35:53] <Grandnatics> It was quarian all along
[2:35:54] <Pookiedaexzile> KROGAN RUSH
[2:35:55] <%MidnightBurst12> wow
[2:35:56] <%DizzyGunner> this game on controller is so much slower, having to pause every 2 seconds to use powers LUL
[2:35:57] <%Maids4lyfe> lol

[2:36:19] <%fat_burtreynolds> Shook it off like a real boi
[2:36:20] <%logoth_> Miranda has a weird monster face
[2:36:20] <%justnathan18> Mirandas fucking idle face
[2:36:21] <+InternetShis> She's a test tube baby
[2:36:21] <quipquest1> it's Michel Jackson's face
[2:36:22] <%AncelDeLambert> always has been
[2:36:24] <+NeonLight> Ah Xbox 360 character models
[2:36:24] <Grandnatics> Miranda stripping abilities Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:36:25] <%TheWinged7> so its not just me that thinks somethings wrong with her face this time
[2:36:25] <skyentombment> what is wrong with your faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
[2:36:26] <%LumberjackJack> What's wrong with your faaaaaaaaaaaaace?!
[2:36:27] <%Eaglestrike117> wait, do you not get an AR as a vanguard? But you had one in the cutscenes
[2:36:28] <+Buzzkill983> Miranda is real good. Pretty much can get through most defenses
[2:36:28] <SpaceGuntank> and remember, miranda is supposed to be "Genetically Perfect"
[2:36:29] <%MugenSandan> What's wrong with her FAAAAAAAACE
[2:36:31] <%hrbeck_> stripping abilities
[2:36:31] <%logoth_> Miranda looks like a sludge goblin
[2:36:33] <spuginky> constant stae of SMUG
[2:36:34] <Broken_Sonex> @RubberFistFight As an ass man i agree
[2:36:35] <Parapattern> Miranda's got spacism poisoning
[2:36:36] <huskarl_zap> Weebs made the human shotgun and called it Japanese sword  LUL
[2:36:36] <peachy996> She's a human thats whats wrong with it
[2:36:38] <Pookiedaexzile> She looks like Chuckie the horror villian.....but dat assssss
[2:36:38] <Archmortal> they changed her entire head.  Her hair especially is basically helmet-shaped now
[2:36:44] <%captainpodock> Did Pat make it Omega yet, or is this the first major mission after the prologue?
[2:36:48] <%fat_burtreynolds> Gonna go back to looking at asses now…
[2:36:51] <quipquest1> Look, her face is just tired, guys
[2:36:52] <ape_hawk> at least this minigame makes more sense then space frogger
[2:36:52] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Corrective surgery for this woman’s face?
[2:36:58] <+pally_din> If Miranda's supposed to be perfect how come she has buck teeth
[2:37:03] <Jaysky> @captainpodock First mission
[2:37:13] <Grandnatics> Perfect by her buckteeth dad standards
[2:37:13] <%QueequegTheater> LUL

[2:37:39] <+MightyDuckShoes> See?! It was a Quarian this whole time
[2:37:40] <%templar010> Theres no dialogue they just say find Veetor
[2:37:40] <%RonaldMcDownload> you got PLOTTED, byotch
[2:37:44] <%fat_burtreynolds> She’s ded nao
[2:37:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> You probably got an autosave before this.
[2:37:46] <%captainpodock> @jaysky thanks
[2:37:46] <thetunnelhomer> Oh no it's jacob.
[2:37:46] <%RubberFistFight> @pokefan9956 what specifically are we lookin at/for?
[2:37:47] <+InternetShis> She's like one of those AI generated "most attractive people" pictures that look like those Real Dolls
[2:37:50] <%AzureGale> Yakuza 0'd
[2:37:57] <Grandnatics> His mouth flashlight looks like a geth head
[2:38:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> The renegade version is where you shoot the screens.
[2:38:03] <%Ravioli_Ronin> The ME equivalent of the Silent hill dog ending
[2:38:05] <%Gamblitz> so do you think jacobs like one of those soldiers how takes trophies from the dead bodies, like he has a bunch of quarian facemasks and turian mandibles
[2:38:09] <%Deft_Thought> You've been H4CK3D BRO
[2:38:10] <%postalnerd787> Interrupts are also a great addition
[2:38:11] <tattleworm> remember you've got that "show me where the objective is" button
[2:38:19] <%RubberFistFight> @Grandnatics stands to reason since the Geth are Quarian technology.
[2:38:20] <+NeonLight> BUUUUUGS
[2:38:21] <RetributionP> vampire pat
[2:38:22] <peachy996> You can be an asshole and send this poor guy to Cerberus for questioning
[2:38:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Gamblitz No he's boring.
[2:38:26] <$antibonehurtingjuice> what the hell is this
[2:38:29] <otakon17> I hate the lack of the radar in this game
[2:38:29] <peachy996> bugs
[2:38:31] <%QueequegTheater> @Grandnatics almost like the Quarians created them or something ResidentSleeper
[2:38:32] <Pookiedaexzile> SPACE BEES
[2:38:34] <Sp3ctre48> Filler villains D:
[2:38:35] <spawnzie> a nerd
[2:38:35] <+InternetShis> The Kollector?
[2:38:36] <stantheman_97> some cool shit
[2:38:38] <%Varlinator> C O L L E C T O R S
[2:38:38] <LluthyY> Buggos
[2:38:38] <+AmericanSkidd> Space Bugs
[2:38:40] <otakon17> SPACE ROACHES
[2:38:40] <Pookiedaexzile> The ultimate Villians
[2:38:40] <+Shubreaker> NAH ITS A HUMAN
[2:38:40] <%Ranryu692> I had entirely forgotten about the Collectors before tonight
[2:38:41] <cellaccount> ahh the people we dont know
[2:38:44] <nuane> Bug men!(not that way)
[2:38:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> The Omega 4 relay?!?
[2:38:46] <+InternetShis> BOOGS
[2:38:48] <otakon17> Collectors...
[2:38:52] <TheIronBrass> DIRECT CONTROL
[2:38:53] <Grandnatics> @QueequegTheater I like the fact that Geth look like mouths for faces then
[2:38:55] <Sp3ctre48> T-They look just like us
[2:39:02] <+InternetShis> ME2 is just a really good filler arc
[2:39:03] <%saadi90> Cicadas
[2:39:04] <+pally_din> how do the bug people work with shady dudes
[2:39:07] <otakon17> THIS HURTS YOU
[2:39:08] <SaltyAzteca> DID I MISS ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL?
[2:39:11] <%MidnightBurst12> ASSUMING
[2:39:12] <ape_hawk> because they werent a thing in the writers brain yet
[2:39:14] <thetunnelhomer> ME2 is 12 filler arcs
[2:39:16] <otakon17> @InternetShis it is
[2:39:19] <thetunnelhomer> One for each companion
[2:39:25] <cellaccount> full coward
[2:39:25] <spawnzie> ASSuming
[2:39:25] <+AmericanSkidd> "They look like Monsters to you..."
[2:39:26] <Jane_Lo> you guys making comments about mirana, just keep in mind that she modeled after an actual person, in terms of face at least
[2:39:29] <%luckysteak> @InternetShis That is a great way to put it
[2:39:31] <KingSpunf> "Collector? That some kinda alien?" is like saying "Hungarians? That some kinda foreigner?"
[2:39:32] <%LumberjackJack> I think TIM says why next time you talk to him? They used to focus on a so few few before ME2
[2:39:33] <+Ghufufin> hmm both games open on a lone survivor
[2:39:34] <%fat_burtreynolds> They call them… the Bronze Ager’s
[2:39:37] <stantheman_97> because they're considered a myth no one takes seriously
[2:39:37] <peachy996> I just can't stop picturing Kollector from Mortal Kombat
[2:39:38] <Sp3ctre48> Daddy issues the video game
[2:39:39] <+MightyDuckShoes> Yvonne Strahovski
[2:39:39] <Broken_Sonex> @InternetShis OMG you're right......
[2:40:01] <%Idziman> Idziman subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[2:40:02] <+pally_din> @peachy996 I literally forgot about that character
[2:40:06] <otakon17> The reason you didn't hear about them before is that they operate OUTSIDE of Citadel space, specifically the Terminus systems that are basically the wild West of the Galaxy
[2:40:10] <%fat_burtreynolds> -Apple has entered the chat
[2:40:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Jane_Lo It's a very poor transfer. She doesn't look like this.
[2:40:14] <+Shubreaker> da human juice
[2:40:22] <Broken_Sonex> @MightyDuckShoes Her name is hard to say so i just call her the Chick from Chuck/Dexter
[2:40:23] <%RubberFistFight> @Jane_Lo I see what they mean though. A lot of the faces in this game fall into the uncanny valley due to the engine limitations, the way the models were constructed, and how the textures are applied.
[2:40:24] <%Gamblitz> They Collector caught ALL 151 pokemon!
[2:40:25] <otakon17> shhh
[2:40:26] <+AmericanSkidd> @Sp3ctre48 Like 90% of the loyalty missions is this somehow
[2:40:26] <+athuramn> oh I forgot about the collectors .-.
[2:40:29] <%fat_burtreynolds> Cloud Storafe
[2:40:33] <thetunnelhomer> Man, I am way more used to SFM models of Miranda. She looks way different in the actual games.
[2:40:42] <%logoth_> DARK ENERGY
[2:40:43] <peachy996> @pally_din I main him so I remember better. same thing happens with Geras sounding like Garrus lol
[2:40:44] <%LumberjackJack> DARK ENERGY
[2:40:45] <nuane> Dark energy D:
[2:40:45] <spawnzie> Bad vibes
[2:40:47] <AngryAsian5> DARK ENERGY
[2:40:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> Her SFM model is her 3 model.
[2:40:49] <Ids560> oh that rotten dark energy
[2:40:50] <$lotharrio> Oh yeah, the dropped dark energy plotline.
[2:40:50] <%QueequegTheater> Everyone ready for this plot point to get dropped super hard
[2:40:50] <dd44dostivei> DARK ENERGY
[2:40:51] <+YabbaTroll> his name is veetor you bitch
[2:40:55] <KeiPrime> dont bother remembering that thing about dark energy
[2:40:57] <sgtbloopface> LIARS
[2:40:57] <+InternetShis> DARK ENERGY? THAT SOUNDS COOL. HOPEFULLY THEY CONTINUE THAT THING THEY BROUGHT UP.
[2:40:58] <+Buzzkill983> DARK ENERGY
[2:40:59] <+NeonLight> Oh hey, dark energy, will be cool to see followups on that
[2:41:00] <+WamenaScrub> Miranda was on Dexter.
[2:41:00] <%RubberFistFight> FUCK OFF MIRANDA
[2:41:00] <ape_hawk> WOW MIRANDA
[2:41:01] <%AzureGale> Agree with Tali
[2:41:02] <%OldOnyx> Oh, yeah the dark energy thing
[2:41:02] <twistedj3ster> WOW
[2:41:02] <%LumberjackJack> Jacob wrong, as always
[2:41:02] <+MightyDuckShoes> More like 12 world building episodes. I care infinitely more about the side stuff in ME than the boring space cuttlefish. You know... the things that turned out completely disappointing?
[2:41:03] <%Varlinator> HE'S NOT A DOG BITCH!
[2:41:04] <ape_hawk> FUCK YOUY
[2:41:07] <otakon17> Miranda, being JUST as racist as Ashley
[2:41:08] <Jane_Lo> @Too_Much_Nukie i disagree, there's certanly is bad makeup and textures choices, but she really really close to her face model
[2:41:10] <dd44dostivei> eeediot
[2:41:10] <Sigma_190_Beta> WOW MIRANDA!
[2:41:11] <%Ravioli_Ronin> I only remember the collectors cause you can play as one in ME3
[2:41:12] <MagmaRam> FUCK CERBERUS
[2:41:12] <Grandnatics> YOU WERE IN CHARGE TALI
[2:41:12] <peachy996> WHAT A DUMBASS that Prazza
[2:41:15] <Grandnatics> YOU KILLED YOUR MEN
[2:41:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> @QueequegTheater It's not dropped, he dies in Cerberus custody.
[2:41:19] <thetunnelhomer> Who would ever side with Miranda on this?
[2:41:24] <%Deadpal> kiss tali. **kiss tali**
[2:41:24] <Jaysky> nyannBlush
[2:41:28] <spawnzie> Well yeah but...
[2:41:31] <+InternetShis> Hey Tali, if you take Veetor, can I take you on my sex shuttle?
[2:41:31] <KingSpunf> We'll bang, OK?
[2:41:32] <otakon17> KISS THE TALI
[2:41:32] <peachy996> Obviously
[2:41:36] <%kewlmyc> Does Tali not join your team in ME2. I forget, it's been years.
[2:41:36] <%Deadpal> Miranada sucks! :)
[2:41:37] <James_Quivers> it would be interesting if they brought the dark energy thing up again in ME4
[2:41:39] <otakon17> that glorious Quarian bum-bum
[2:41:41] <%Treuan> sadge
[2:41:41] <+InternetShis> Thanks Casey Hudson
[2:41:42] <Jaysky> What was it?
[2:41:42] <+YabbaTroll> Dark energy?
[2:41:42] <+Totally_Not_Toby> unfortunately
[2:41:42] <peachy996> Jacob doesn't get annoyed in this
[2:41:43] <%AncelDeLambert> more Miranda, Jacob probably doesn't care
[2:41:43] <bethore> But... dat ass
[2:41:43] <NitronStreams> Get Fucked Cerberus
[2:41:46] <%CalderGaming> BibleThump the dark energy plotline
[2:41:46] <otakon17> @kewlmyc she does
[2:41:47] <+SinnerEbru> u_u
[2:41:48] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> whats the mission?!!?!?
[2:41:51] <DatAsuna> The dark energy plotline made no sense anyway when the reapers FORCE US to use eezo
[2:41:51] <+athuramn> dark energy plot line?
[2:41:51] <Broken_Sonex> @Jane_Lo Yeah it's honestly kinda rude
[2:41:53] <peachy996> He's your toady through and through
[2:41:53] <sgtbloopface> plus its super bad if cerberus takes veetor
[2:41:55] <+gespenst25> That was a real cool throughline they had once
[2:41:58] <%justnathan18> She joins later
[2:42:00] <Grandnatics> Also they wanted to interrogate a clearly unstable mental break patient
[2:42:00] <%OldOnyx> which was entirely EAs doing this time
[2:42:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> Oh that's what you guys mean.
[2:42:02] <otakon17> yeah the Dark Energy plotline was crazier but I liked it more
[2:42:02] <%QueequegTheater> BUT THE PRIIIIIIIZE
[2:42:05] <peachy996> It's Miranda you squabble with
[2:42:05] <signofzeta> evil buggos
[2:42:05] <%logoth_> I sure hope they dont have a NEMESIS
[2:42:06] <Sp3ctre48> @MightyDuckShoes Part of the reason the latter ended up being disappointing is because the plot doesn't continue at all in this game imo
[2:42:06] <Parapattern> E V I L
[2:42:07] <%RubberFistFight> @Jane_Lo That doesn't mean the model isn't constructed weirdly, making her facial proportions subtly "wrong" though.
[2:42:07] <%kewlmyc> @otakon17 Cool, thanks
[2:42:08] <Pookiedaexzile> TALIS THICCER THAN MIRANDA
[2:42:08] <+The_monster_hunter> who is he romancing in this run
[2:42:09] <Jane_Lo> and also, i believe this is a me3 model of miranda? isn't it? cause her hair was different in og me2
[2:42:09] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Fuck you casey Hudson
[2:42:10] <Ids560> like, it also didn't make sense but it sucked a lot less than what we got
[2:42:10] <+InternetShis> All because someone leaked ME3's ending and they speedwrote a new ending
[2:42:12] <nuane> im sure we'll never see them again
[2:42:12] <logothete2401> I actually really don't like the dark energy plotline and I get why they didn't do with it.
[2:42:12] <%Varlinator> It didn't really get dropped
[2:42:13] <%captainpodock> The sheer naivete of Jacob and Miranda regarding the Illusive Man and his motivations is astounding.
[2:42:14] <stantheman_97> the dark energy plotline sounds so...
[2:42:19] <otakon17> ALSO if you play on Hardcore you can get a GETH ASSAULT RIFLE from her recruitment mission
[2:42:19] <%NateyBeak> HANG UP ON HIM TOO
[2:42:20] <%hrbeck_> the DARK energy
[2:42:26] <%DorianCreed> Evil and not as cool as the evil guys from the last game
[2:42:27] <+bassforte123> man, how come we can't hang up on the Illusive man for fun?
[2:42:27] <%OldOnyx> well aside from whoever leaked it
[2:42:28] <crookedfinger68> oh shit martin sheen
[2:42:29] <%captain_thickthighs> reslisticly you can always just talk to him later cant interveiw a dead man
[2:42:29] <+kullumanati> Time for purple 💥
[2:42:29] <%Lion_kun> MARTIN SHEEEN <3
[2:42:30] <jorniev> WHAT is the dark energy plotline?
[2:42:32] <%fat_burtreynolds> *space whaling*
[2:42:32] <%justnathan18> Jacob is just dumb muscle
[2:42:33] <otakon17> God I love the holograms in this game
[2:42:36] <Broken_Sonex> @Pookiedaexzile Wider hips you mean
[2:42:38] <spawnzie> GRAPPLE AWAY
[2:42:39] <akitanito> okay Tim
[2:42:40] <%RubberFistFight> @Jane_Lo Hardly. People aren't criticizing Yvonne Strahovski, they're criticising
[2:42:40] <%QueequegTheater> GEE I WONDER THE FUCK WHY THAT IS
[2:42:41] <peachy996> I wonder why...
[2:42:42] <jorniev> I LOVE THIS GUY
[2:42:44] <SaltyAzteca> Lvl 5 diplomancy skills
[2:42:44] <otakon17> Jacob is bland muscle he's not dumb
[2:42:44] <DatAsuna> @athuramn tl;dr the basica idea during ME2 was reapers reap because using eezo speeds u entropy do the niverse dies faster. Only it's stupid because ME1 established that the reapers make every society use eezo @jorniev
[2:42:48] <Sigma_190_Beta> THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU LEAD WITH IT FIRST!
[2:42:48] <%LumberjackJack> I WONDER WHY, TIM?!
[2:42:48] <+D00msDayDan> i hate having to play tali's mission on insanity every time for the gun
[2:42:49] <thetunnelhomer> Maybe if you weren't so evil Martin Sheen.
[2:42:49] <+NeonLight> So what hes saying is "Diplomacy has failed"?
[2:42:50] <%scottlind> Aww, shit, it's Martin Sheen
[2:42:50] <Sp3ctre48> We can't really say whether the dark energy plot would have been good or not, it's only setup in this game
[2:42:51] <MagmaRam> DAMN WHY DOES EVERYONE PERCEIVE OUR SHADOWY FASCIST GROUP AS A THREAT. IT IS A MYSTERY.
[2:42:51] <%RubberFistFight> @Jane_Lo Miranda's weird face.
[2:42:51] <%anticrust> THEY PERCIEVE YOU AS A THREAT CAUSE YOU ACT LIKE A THREAT
[2:42:53] <+AmericanSkidd> "Gee why would they think THAT?"
[2:42:55] <CastellanVon> God the art design of this place is amazing
[2:42:56] <Sigma_190_Beta> WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING TIM!
[2:42:59] <otakon17> but GODDAMN I love Martin Sheen as TIM
[2:43:02] <Jaysky> THIS HURTS YOU.
[2:43:07] <%Gogogolem> Is he just smoking a blunt?
[2:43:07] <%captainpodock> @patstaresat do they explain what the Illusive Man is smoking? I forget
[2:43:12] <%king_wragles> WHY IS THE EYE WITNESS NARRATOR DOING SPACE CRIME
[2:43:13] <RetributionP> the thing a ought Jacob is. he could of done somthing like garris. Instead Jacob decides to join up with the space racists.
[2:43:18] <%Gamblitz> Illusive man: I like going to the zoo, but i don't work with animals
[2:43:19] <+InternetShis> The bug credit economy is crazy powerful
[2:43:22] <MrPandastic> Yeah its almost like people hate Cerberus because they're so bloody evil.
[2:43:23] <MagmaRam> @captainpodock is he not just smoking cigarettes
[2:43:25] <MichelangeloStark> why is uncle Ben talking to us? isn't he dead????
[2:43:25] <Jane_Lo> @RubberFistFight i mean, sure, bioware did poor job, but most the comments i've read in the chat weren't really nice
[2:43:26] <+aartbastiaan> "TIM" is the worst fan name ever
[2:43:26] <%AFellowDegen> Kill all the racist quarrians #GethDidNothingwrong
[2:43:29] <Sp3ctre48> It's a mass relay....but red
[2:43:34] <otakon17> @captainpodock really expensive ciggies
[2:43:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Elusive Man only smokes that Elusive Pack
[2:43:37] <%NateyBeak> Omega 4 fatty acids relay
[2:43:38] <%CalderGaming> @jorniev iirc it was going to be a spiral nemesis kind of thing where the reapers do what they do to keep the galaxy from imploding
[2:43:39] <KingSpunf> Is he smoking grass, or astroturf?
[2:43:40] <%Lion_kun> Illusive man was so cool and ME3 ruined him.
[2:43:42] <thetunnelhomer> Jacob joins the space racists cause he is kinda racists.
[2:43:50] <%justnathan18> @RetributionP Because Jacob IS a space racist. He calls Garrus a slur if you date him instead of jacob
[2:43:51] <+pally_din> @AFellowDegen Yeah but then you have to kill Tali that's fucking stupid
[2:43:51] <peachy996> Any Terminator related theories?
[2:43:52] <+gespenst25> @Jaysky The jist of it is that dark energy was increasing, the first ancestral race basically decided to turn themselves into computers so that they could figure out a solution to entropy. But they couldn't so they seeded life through the galaxy and every so often can and reaped the harvest of new people to turn into computers in the hope that the new prospective would help them stop the universe ending due to entropy.
[2:43:54] <+MightyDuckShoes> @sp3ctre48 It absolutely does. the plot in 3 only didn't because they dropped every crumb set up here in 2. The Rise of Skywalker Ed one of the most popular RPG sequels.
[2:43:54] <otakon17> @aartbastiaan we don't know his real name, his title is The Illusive Man so everyone calls him TIM for short
[2:43:55] <%OrangeMDT> what's the deal with omega-4 fatty acids?
[2:43:58] <$antibonehurtingjuice> they think your dick is HUUUGE
[2:43:58] <Pookiedaexzile> He Smoking dat Elusive Og
[2:43:59] <+athuramn> @datasuna ty! I had no idea that was thrown out
[2:44:04] <+Shubreaker> yumans
[2:44:07] <thetunnelhomer> TIM was never cool, he was always a weird DMPC shoved in there.
[2:44:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Preroll
[2:44:09] <%RubberFistFight> @Jane_Lo Again though, they're criticizing Miranda, not Yvonne Strahovski. It wouldn't be the first time a game took an attractive person and made the model based on them look weird.
[2:44:12] <%AFellowDegen> @AFellowDegen fucking worth it
[2:44:20] <%justnathan18> The Illusive man is baked AF thats why his eyes look like that
[2:44:21] <akitanito> the secret is that he's not really holding the cigarette
[2:44:30] <+aartbastiaan> @justnathan18 slur? lol I don't think that word applies thete
[2:44:31] <SaltyAzteca> And a ship
[2:44:31] <%captainpodock> @magmaram I assumed for whatever reason. that it wasn't cigarettes but I could just be a moron lol, maybe because it's space I assumed it has to be something exotic.
[2:44:32] <%Ranryu692> Martin Sheen is so much cooler than this children
[2:44:33] <+tigerfang86> we'll need a REALLY COOL ANIME TEAM
[2:44:33] <%QueequegTheater> TWENTY GOOD MEN
[2:44:34] <%idyota> LUL
[2:44:35] <ape_hawk> minus jacob and miranda
[2:44:35] <peachy996> And Jacob.
[2:44:38] <+AmericanSkidd> and use like 5 of them
[2:44:40] <%AzureGale> Need to recruit adults with attitude
[2:44:40] <dalish2k> YEYEYEYE
[2:44:41] <%kujofire990> get mordin 1st
[2:44:42] <rekinom> I'm gonna need at least 2 blue ladies
[2:44:43] <+Dreadknight297> 15?!
[2:44:44] <Pookiedaexzile> THink about it, he never gets up
[2:44:45] <Zalapski> 15 cool people and jacob
[2:44:46] <RetributionP> you only get like 12 cool people
[2:44:47] <$lotharrio> I'll need 12 cool people and I guess Jacob can be there too
[2:44:47] <otakon17> @gespenst25 yeah basically the REapers started off pretty noble and felt that the solution to entrophy was more important than a few trillion intelligent lives
[2:44:47] <%Dfreddy8> DID HE JUST SAY JACKET B WAS COOL?
[2:44:48] <+NeonLight> And a reeeally cool ship
[2:44:48] <MichelangeloStark> someone tell me why Shepard is talking to uncle Ben!
[2:44:49] <%fat_burtreynolds> He dipped it in LSD
[2:44:49] <+InternetShis> I'm gonna need so many amazing, sexy, broken badasses that I can fix
[2:44:49] <Broken_Sonex> @otakon17 His real name is Jack Harper
[2:44:50] <%bassoontyphoon> Haven’t we had enough zoom meetings this year
[2:44:52] <%Varlinator> A REAAAAAAAALY GOOD TEAM
[2:44:58] <+Rhamboned> MORDIN TIME SOON
[2:44:58] <jorniev> ZAEEED
[2:44:59] <%ScottishMadJacko> @aartbastiaan jacob does call garus the turian equivalent of a slur
[2:45:01] <jorniev> KASUMIII
[2:45:03] <peachy996> You go to Omega you can get 2 good aliens and Zaeed
[2:45:08] <%luckysteak> does this edition let you get your party members in any order?
[2:45:09] <$realm_forge> MORDIN IS THE BEST MAD SCIENTIST
[2:45:11] <%scottlind> JACK
[2:45:12] <%bassoontyphoon> Zaeed first
[2:45:13] <+NeonLight> "Most of them" as in, like, two? Maybe?
[2:45:13] <%aWanderingKaivo> whats with the weird shadow crossing over Shep's hologram
[2:45:13] <otakon17> Pat you can pick up Kasumi and Saeed IMMEDIATELY
[2:45:15] <+pally_din> Where's my best friend?
[2:45:15] <+AmericanSkidd> hes batman now
[2:45:17] <+tigerfang86> BIG HOT
[2:45:17] <%luckysteak> It would be so cool to get Legion from the start
[2:45:18] <Sp3ctre48> @MightyDuckShoes I mean, not really? Mass Effect 2 has good worldbuilding that is resolved (to varying degrees of success in ME3) but the main plot with the Reapers isn't progressed at all in ME2, it's one of the main reasons ME3 ended up being a shitshow
[2:45:22] <%AncelDeLambert> Garrus is so FUCKING COOL in this game!
[2:45:23] <$antibonehurtingjuice> NARC
[2:45:23] <%fat_burtreynolds> I’ll need access to my MAGNUM DONG
[2:45:24] <Jaysky> Not dead.
[2:45:24] <+Buzzkill983> Kasumi mission gives best submachine gun imo
[2:45:25] <zerointelligence000> Garrus is busy being a badass
[2:45:27] <cellaccount> were people
[2:45:28] <LluthyY> best boy moving up in the world
[2:45:29] <tattleworm> there should be an option to ask if ash is still vaporised
[2:45:31] <+OmegaWeltall> paige is back?
[2:45:33] <BeastlyWhale> the 2 year time skip is so sick
[2:45:34] <otakon17> Garrus is SPACE BATMAN
[2:45:34] <SaltyAzteca> WREX UR NOT
[2:45:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> This game is the start of God Emperor Garrus.
[2:45:41] <%aWanderingKaivo> @otakon17 super good to get Kasumi early, get that Locust SMG
[2:45:41] <thetunnelhomer> Kaiden actually outranks Shepard at this point
[2:45:42] <%dekkitout> Good for Wrex
[2:45:42] <Archmortal> Where's Ashley?  Heh
[2:45:44] <%AncelDeLambert> he's a little bit Genghis Khan
[2:45:45] <parkslady> LUL
[2:45:47] <quipquest1> So he's Canderous
[2:45:50] <Coystick> She's SO CUTE
[2:45:51] <%Dfreddy8> Omoto
[2:45:52] <Pookiedaexzile> KING WREX
[2:45:55] <ThatGuyThere03> YEEEEEAHHHHHHHHHHHH MANDALORE
[2:45:55] <+EmptyMug> MandoWrex
[2:45:56] <Jaysky> She blue
[2:45:59] <Too_Much_Nukie> Kaiden doesn't outrank Shepard yet. He's a commander.
[2:46:00] <dd44dostivei> ehh...
[2:46:00] <%Urgotfantasy> PAT.
[2:46:00] <%justnathan18> "Over a year" for a Krogan is like 3 weeks
[2:46:00] <peachy996> Pat: "Hey this bucket is so cute"
[2:46:01] <$antibonehurtingjuice> bonk
[2:46:01] <scrumbotime> Juices Jigglin'
[2:46:01] <+aartbastiaan> @scottishmadjacko why are you afraid to say it, it's not a real slur
[2:46:03] <%Varlinator> Boooooo
[2:46:06] <+StoopKid241> wtf
[2:46:07] <$KetsuoTaberu> m'juice
[2:46:07] <+AmericanSkidd> His sources SUCK
[2:46:07] <Sp3ctre48> "She's still stalking you Shepard"
[2:46:08] <%spoiledbadger> wtf pat
[2:46:09] <%RubberFistFight> @Jane_Lo not to mention if you actually look at pictures of Yvonne, the only things they used are her eyes, nose, and lips. The actual shape and size of Miranda's head, AND her hair, are totally different. THAT'S why it looks weird.
[2:46:10] <nuane> -1
[2:46:12] <+pally_din> My sources say she is DLC
[2:46:12] <+gespenst25> @otakon17 They basically made the ultimate renegade choice. And then hit every red prompt for the rest of history. it's a shame I feel like that plot would have been way more interesting.
[2:46:13] <%QueequegTheater> @quipquest1 he's basically Better Cando
[2:46:13] <%linSP> what about ashle- oh
[2:46:13] <thetunnelhomer> Oh god, Wrex just is Mandalore
[2:46:15] <ioci2112> her tits are bigger now for some reason
[2:46:16] <Zeif00> Dat Blussy
[2:46:16] <%Gamblitz> Mandalore the SHEPARD
[2:46:18] <+InternetShis> She still got em flowin'
[2:46:24] <%ScottishMadJacko> @aartbastiaan cause im not cool with slurs, even fake ones
[2:46:24] <%OldOnyx> yeah the idea was that biotics and other stuff was sort of like arcane  magic in darksun... sort of
[2:46:32] <otakon17> @aWanderingKaivo that's only if you do her mission IMMEDIATELY but it'll be hard with NO upgrades at all at first so I suggest grabbing the DLC characters and then grabbing all the shop upgrades you can
[2:46:37] <%fat_burtreynolds> psaBig psaBig Pregnant
[2:46:39] <peachy996> RUN TO OMEGA
[2:46:39] <otakon17> you can GET re-SPECTRE'd

[2:47:17] <+MightyDuckShoes> @sp3ctre48 ME2 is where we find out the reapers are each the genetic memory of entire species. each reaper is an extinct species harvested. that's why the human reaper is in this one. They're organic monsters wrapped in armor that tricked the geth. And then the third game comes out and the reapers are magically robots again. just robots.

[2:48:26] <Jane_Lo> @RubberFistFight that is true, but i feel like it's still showcases that bioware is kind of like "well, we'll use model but we'll edit them anyway"
[2:48:27] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Joker says all higher ups are rich dirtbags anyway lol
[2:48:28] <%Varlinator> Bigger & Better Normandy!
[2:48:28] <%AzureGale> Was this also a Human-Turian collab

[2:48:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> Joker walks like a cripple.
[2:48:43] <+NeonLight> I love how Cerberus looked at the peak of human technology, top secret military tech and one of a kind, and they said "Yeah, we'll do it but better"
[2:48:44] <%watts121> I'm still mad ME3 didn't have the SR2 leading a squadron of SR1's into the battle at Earth.

[2:48:47] <otakon17> yeah the braces are under his pants
[2:48:49] <stantheman_97> he can walk just not fast or well
[2:48:50] <ape_hawk> "i can cum on so much of this ship, joker."
[2:48:50] <MagmaRam> cerberus is really absurdly powerful and wealthy, funding an entire warship which is a larger version of one that already equaled a heavy cruiser in cost, and the infrastructure to build it, and doing it all covertly is absurd
[2:48:54] <%ScottishMadJacko> @aartbastiaan thats a crap excuse, why care about anything in games then since none of its real with that logic
[2:48:54] <haitakaa> the orbandy

[2:49:02] <%GarbageNirvana> Okay next question, how'd he get so jacked if he can't lift anything heavier than a pencil
[2:49:02] <Archmortal> a much SHINIER Normandy, which as Elon Musk has shown us is fucking FANTASTIC for stealth
[2:49:04] <yourliteraldog> I think Joker was honorably discharged
[2:49:04] <Pookiedaexzile> "We put a normandy in ya normandy so you can fuck two alien girls at the same time"
[2:49:04] <digaogrunge> Its cause of his huge balls
[2:49:07] <%Gamblitz> EWW Cerberus Livery
[2:49:07] <otakon17> @NeonLight and you can STILL improve it further(and have to to get the best ending!)
[2:49:08] <DatAsuna> is the sound fucked for anyone else?
[2:49:11] <peachy996> dun dun dun dun
[2:49:13] <jorniev> THE MUSIC IS SO GOOD
[2:49:15] <+athuramn> cerberus is future tesla
[2:49:16] <%fat_burtreynolds> he lost his legs during the Fappening
[2:49:17] <RetributionP> ahh bjg dick energy here
[2:49:17] <%ssjklyco> They brought shepard to life, but they could not fix his Boneites?
[2:49:18] <%AzureGale> The mission complete music is SO GOOD
[2:49:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> This scene always reminded me of the scene in Star Trek The Motion Picture where Kirk is watching the new Enterprise in dock.
[2:49:20] <%Dfreddy8> Also LEATHER SEATS
[2:49:20] <%Varlinator> Time to fill this big badass ship with squadmates & cum!
[2:49:23] <+InternetShis> Scrape the yellow off and paint it red
[2:49:25] <%QueequegTheater> HEAVY WEAPON
[2:49:25] <%captainpodock> You would think with it being the future Joker would be able to get some sort of exoskeleton or sle.tging
[2:49:26] <Alzero83> Get Kasumi first @PatStaresAt
[2:49:27] <Jaysky> @DatAsuna It sounded fucky over here too
[2:49:28] <dd44dostivei> joker's whole skeleton got brittle in the last two years
[2:49:29] <Zalapski> SourPls
[2:49:29] <%JohnAtDawn> ALRIGHT LETS GO MORDIN
[2:49:30] <RrenKrieg> @Archmortal optical sensors would be useless in space

[2:49:34] <MagmaRam> @Too_Much_Nukie yeah but this one doesn't take nine hours
[2:49:34] <peachy996> Great Mission Complete music
[2:49:37] <otakon17> XP is only doled out at the END of a mission
[2:49:37] <Parapattern> PFFFFT
[2:49:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> You missed 1000 Credits somewhere.
[2:49:43] <$RealThiele> EDI is perfect for joker really, that robotic precision while boning helps a lot i bet
[2:49:44] <%QueequegTheater> OH NO HERE COMES BAD HAIR
[2:49:45] <%OrangeMDT> Man, I bet TIM watched Oshiete Galko-chan
[2:49:45] <otakon17> HOODIE! you too Pat?!

[2:50:01] <otakon17> I LIKE Kelly Chambers
[2:50:03] <%RubberFistFight> @stantheman_97 i knew a guy in high school with the same disease as Joker. The slow/limping walk is totally a thing.
[2:50:04] <%NCC1701Dave> Shepard looks delightfully dirtbagish
[2:50:05] <yourliteraldog> Seth Green fucks a boat
[2:50:05] <mar_krow> Kelly
[2:50:06] <%Varlinator> He looks so pissed LUL
[2:50:06] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, now go right down and KISS CHAKWA!
[2:50:07] <%justnathan18> This could only be better if Shepard had his hands down his pants while walking in in the hoodie
[2:50:08] <otakon17> @spawnzie it's just like that
[2:50:08] <stormhawk9891> Shut up jacob

[2:50:11] <Sigma_190_Beta> God, this makes me want to buy this game even though I am still on strike for any EA game.
[2:50:11] <Parapattern> "I'm in my jammies."
[2:50:11] <peachy996> The Crew in 2 is much better than 1 or 3
[2:50:11] <+pally_din> The music thing is on Twitch's end
[2:50:12] <Jaysky> Pat, is the music wobbly sounding to you?
[2:50:13] <ChaosedStar> creepy uncle is back in business baby
[2:50:13] <DatAsuna> it's slowing down and speeding up constantly
[2:50:13] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> This game started the selling of merchandise

[2:50:15] <+aartbastiaan> @scottishmadjacko you can care while realising it's not real
[2:50:15] <Pookiedaexzile> It just feels like the literally just made it wider
[2:50:17] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt At some point shouldn't he be a Captain
[2:50:17] <otakon17> I think it's because this Normandy isn't really the original
[2:50:17] <+NeonLight> Omeega
[2:50:18] <$RealThiele> Nermandy

[2:50:55] <%Gamblitz> Oh man miss the gaming era of "Tricia Helfer"
[2:50:55] <otakon17> EDI IS THE BEST

[2:51:03] <%Ravioli_Ronin> THEY PUT A CYLON ON MY SHIP
[2:51:07] <+MightyDuckShoes> Joker and Edit have such great banter... and then...
[2:51:07] <%Varlinator> He's gonna like it real nice
[2:51:09] <%RubberFistFight> Hey look it's a random side-quest from the first game that you never expected to pop up again, especially not like this.

[2:51:50] <%hrbeck_> SHEP: I only interface with 10s and useful 9s
[2:51:54] <+aartbastiaan> @scottishmadjacko calm down man
[2:51:54] <Alzero83> hating on Jacob is Racist, Pat
[2:51:54] <Jane_Lo> @StrawberryPantsu next
[2:51:54] <peachy996> Jacob hates the Alliance but wants to pretend like Cerberus is a better Alliance
[2:51:56] <dd44dostivei> EDI isnt bad in 3, she just obliterates the brechdel test
[2:51:57] <%Varlinator> ...And we never talked to Jacob again.
[2:51:59] <TioXyco> at least jacob is not Ashley
[2:52:03] <%QueequegTheater> @AncelDeLambert bruh he cheats on FemShep
[2:52:03] <parkslady> WHAT
[2:52:05] <%AncelDeLambert> THAT'S A DIFFERENT UNIVERSE
[2:52:08] <%dekkitout> That's it?
[2:52:08] <TheIronBrass> Miranda took your old room
[2:52:08] <+pally_din> Yeeeeah Jacob isn't great
[2:52:08] <yourliteraldog> Lol
[2:52:09] <huskarl_zap> PROBE URANUS
[2:52:09] <Archmortal> @hat_under_bread he absolutely is a massive asshole what are you saying
[2:52:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> @MagmaRam The first one. A lot of them are even former Alliance. He did it to earn Shepard's trust.
[2:52:11] <%W1nterTitan> What.
[2:52:11] <spawnzie> HE WHAT
[2:52:12] <%Lion_kun> He is not as bad as Ashley.
[2:52:12] <BinaryShuffle> NANI!?
[2:52:12] <+NeonLight> OOF
[2:52:13] <%idyota> you can beat his ass in the citadel dlc tho
[2:52:13] <Jane_Lo> YEAH, THANK YOU PAT
[2:52:14] <yourliteraldog> He dose that
[2:52:14] <cellaccount> hmmm
[2:52:15] <Wolfstriker121> REALLY?!?!
[2:52:15] <peachy996> Fuck Femshep tho, that's her fault for not picking Garrus or Thane
[2:52:15] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> ??????
[2:52:16] <RetributionP> then don't date him
[2:52:18] <%sunsetdisc0> good thing only like 3 people romanced him
[2:52:18] <ne0bunny> arent you planning to cheat on liara??
[2:52:18] <%CalderGaming> okay but that's not in THIS timeline
[2:52:19] <%QueequegTheater> YES
[2:52:19] <thetunnelhomer> ME3 did Jacob so dirty it's not even funny
[2:52:20] <DatAsuna> Jacob is the worst yeah
[2:52:20] <cellaccount> dreamy
[2:52:20] <ShiningAxis> but the prize
[2:52:20] <Sp3ctre48> He also has by far the worst loyalty mission in the game
[2:52:20] <sgtbloopface> hes also racist to garrus if you reject him for garrus
[2:52:20] <%snow_bush> yup
[2:52:21] <%charp35> And he  only waits two months to cheat on her
[2:52:21] <%justnathan18> THE ONLY BLACK GUY cheats on Femshep and knocks up another woman
[2:52:22] <%DJFakie> Yep
[2:52:22] <%Gamblitz> EDI is just Data in Mass Effect 3
[2:52:24] <Ids560> him doing that is very funny though
[2:52:25] <+liquidzr0> adumBooty just keepin it real
[2:52:25] <%Varlinator> Also boring
[2:52:26] <%QueequegTheater> PAT IS CORRECT FOR ONCE
[2:52:26] <%aWanderingKaivo> not only that, its not even like shep died like in between 1 and 2
[2:52:26] <stantheman_97> he won't do that in this timeline
[2:52:26] <%shadowsofpain> Not yet, also your not Femshep
[2:52:26] <MagmaRam> @TioXyco idk, ashley was racist but she was in the alliance, jacob is part of a human-supremacist paramilitary/conspiracy
[2:52:26] <Sigma_190_Beta> Jacob is the worst party member in this entire series. Quote me on that.
[2:52:27] <$RealThiele> prison pass jacob
[2:52:27] <dalish2k> I WAS SUPRISED TO HEAR THAT TOO!
[2:52:27] <%Dfreddy8> PROBE URANUS
[2:52:28] <peachy996> That's why you pick Garrus not Jacob
[2:52:28] <%bassoontyphoon> But the prizzze
[2:52:28] <Grandnatics> he's a massive POS
[2:52:32] <peyodogo> also femshep's romance with him is so weird, she's like all cougar-y out of nowhere
[2:52:33] <%Ranryu692> a shlubby, shlubby mirror
[2:52:34] <+Maleicus> jacobs just like his dad
[2:52:36] <MagmaRam> @Sigma_190_Beta upi
[2:52:36] <Josef_Stryker> ZAEED
[2:52:38] <hat_under_bread> I never heard about that. Probably because nobody I knew ever romanced him.
[2:52:39] <parkslady> I'm glad he died on my playthrough then that prick
[2:52:39] <%RubberFistFight> @peachy996 My femshep picked liara. Hot blue space tiddies.
[2:52:40] <dd44dostivei> Jacob is literally just a black male sex object. that's his only purpose.
[2:52:41] <susukouhai> He cant cheat, only I can!
[2:52:43] <MagmaRam> You're right and you should say it @Sigma_190_Beta
[2:52:43] <Sigma_190_Beta> @TioXyco He also dropped out of the Alliance.
[2:52:43] <%Varlinator> Alright, time to do the rounds
[2:52:45] <+Totally_Not_Toby> it's amazing how much of an upgrade it is

[2:55:14] <KingSpunf> Jack a ugly bih
[2:55:14] <James_Quivers> talk to joker boy

[2:55:21] <%Mekhet09> I wish kasumi had more shit it sucks that she was DLC.
[2:55:21] <+Totally_Not_Toby> pat just hates strong female characters, that's probably what it is Kappa

[2:55:26] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt talk to EDI and Joker

[2:55:33] <ape_hawk> hello robogina
[2:55:33] <Pookiedaexzile> "Benching Jordan, just doesn't have it"
[2:55:34] <DSD24> Her design is not cool in this game
[2:55:37] <%bread_assassin> Mording ->Garrus -> Grunt -> Jack is what I always do.
[2:55:38] <%Dfreddy8> Also "Don't fuck with Aria"
[2:55:39] <huskarl_zap> Zaead is the first character you meet on TErminus
[2:55:40] <Jane_Lo> @peyodogo yeah, but i remember playing this first time after me1 (where i romanced liara) and going "huh? u have a girl, why you be fliritng here" LUL
[2:55:40] <peachy996> I hate Tali and Liara, Sorry Pat your waifus are trash.
[2:55:41] <Jaysky> @HaroldDonchee Yes because the game is trying to swerve you that he's not in like Wrex

[2:56:07] <%bassoontyphoon> I’d get Kasumi, then Zaeed
[2:56:09] <%Varlinator> SEX!

[2:56:19] <%QueequegTheater> @Alzero83 we don't get to fuck her, she's Joker's sex doll
[2:56:23] <%Gamblitz> I just realized that EDI is designed to look like a chess Pawn
[2:56:25] <peachy996> Edi was better as a voice than a sexbot
[2:56:25] <+InternetShis> "You must advance the story to plug me in, Shepard"
[2:56:25] <%Ravioli_Ronin> She translates ancient sith
[2:56:26] <%Daxalog> "When I level up I will get stronger"
[2:56:27] <%dekkitout> Groovy
[2:56:27] <%truexst0rm> Hey @PatStaresAt! How goes 'Resurrection 'P'?'

[2:56:35] <akitanito> just space their ship
[2:56:36] <Jane_Lo> still salty that they didn't allowed me to smooch tali as femshep in legendary edition :(
[2:56:38] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt You might want to go to the citadel, recruit Kasumi, and get re-instated as a Spectre first. Then go to Omega.
[2:56:39] <%justnathan18> Jack looks like a Hot Topic exploded.

[3:06:04] <Wolfstriker121> max is 100k now i think
[3:06:05] <seancbo> I like how if you import a save, it just breaks the economy of this game LUL I forgot that this game even had money
[3:06:06] <%QueequegTheater> @IndoorSitup I don't find offensive autism stereotyping great
[3:06:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> And doesn't work like you think it does.
[3:06:10] <KingSpunf> wex
[3:06:12] <beefcakemanthrob> kasumi is so cool
[3:06:18] <%castlerock42> Pat, make sure to at least get the ship upgrade from Jacob.
[3:06:23] <+AmericanSkidd> Pretty nice of the bank to do that very cool
[3:06:25] <$antibonehurtingjuice> thats a lot of good boy points
[3:06:26] <peachy996> @KingSpunf Garrus tho
[3:06:27] <%QueequegTheater> @IndoorSitup you probably also think BBT is a great sitcom
[3:06:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> Overlord is still pretty fun even with the autism stereotyping.
[3:06:32] <%tyler274> the bang room
[3:06:36] <thetunnelhomer> Oh yea, I forgot Jacob has a ship upgrade
[3:06:36] <RetributionP> did you know in a diffrent universe pat did the same thing Jacob did?
[3:06:39] <Essixian> Throbbing with element zero
[3:06:43] <%LumberjackJack> LUL Pat delaying

[3:06:57] <+GamerWorlock> I like the music on Kasumi's mission
[3:07:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait isn't Pat gonna cheat on Liara with Tali
[3:07:04] <DatAsuna> 3d printed guns
[3:07:08] <thetunnelhomer> @RetributionP To be fair, Liara does brush off the romance super hard without the DLC.
[3:07:08] <+Shubreaker> EXIT GAME
[3:07:12] <%Dylveryn> @QueequegTheater now that's just harsh
[3:07:12] <+MightyDuckShoes> @kingspunf All the love interests should ha e had helmets or be freaked monster women from the neck up. Anything to avoid the human uncanny valley.
[3:07:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Is SHepat just JAcob
[3:07:17] <peachy996> Kasumi's mission is cool bet Kasumi herself? eh
[3:07:17] <DSD24> @GamerWorlock Oh man its so good
[3:07:20] <DatAsuna> you can recruit kasumi without doing her loyalty right away
[3:07:25] <peachy996> She's funny at least
[3:07:26] <Broken_Sonex> @DSD24 She's really good
[3:07:26] <DSD24> Ah yes its Man
[3:07:35] <Meekest> Oof that second one
[3:07:36] <+AmericanSkidd> @Too_Much_Nukie Cerberus would absolutely be the kind of group to try to WEAPONIZE AUTISM
[3:07:36] <ape_hawk> no one likes a suck up, jacob
[3:07:36] <DatAsuna> I like kasumi herself more than the mission
[3:07:39] <Grandnatics> Screw this dude

[3:07:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> Kasumi is cool buuuut she doesn't have as much dialogue because she's DLC>
[3:07:43] <$antibonehurtingjuice> yes
[3:07:43] <+pally_din> :)
[3:07:43] <%RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater I think Overlord is great and I think BBT is absolute garbage. So where on the venn diagram do I go?
[3:07:43] <spawnzie> Hugh Mann
[3:07:44] <%QueequegTheater> FUCK HIM
[3:07:45] <peachy996> And Kasumi is the Infiltrator of the Group

[3:08:03] <DSD24> Be a jerk to Jack
[3:08:11] <peachy996> He's your yes man, Pat. Don't expect to Ash him. This one is a Kaiden
[3:08:11] <Pookiedaexzile> You aren't even Femshep
[3:08:12] <+discodemolition> I actually don't mind Jacob lmao
[3:08:15] <Halospaz117> God you make Kaiden look interesting
[3:08:18] <Broken_Sonex> Quiet Black Kaiden
[3:08:18] <%kewlmyc> Jacob is cool in my book
[3:08:25] <%LumberjackJack> UH HUH
[3:08:26] <dd44dostivei> talking to him as femshep sucks so much. she's such a skeezy boss.
[3:08:29] <Josef_Stryker> Jacob is just so barebones
[3:08:30] <buhbuhboat> no they wont
[3:08:31] <%QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight Wherever is labelled "autism blackface is fine as long as I like the gameplay", I guess
[3:08:31] <peyodogo> be an asshole to jacob he deserves it
[3:08:32] <stantheman_97> at least he's honest
[3:08:34] <%QueequegTheater> Kappa
[3:08:35] <Josef_Stryker> I don't give a single shit about him
[3:08:35] <QuestlordJake> yeah actions like taking down sovereign?
[3:08:36] <ianabstract> "Hm what has cerberus done besides kill all my men in a terrorist ambush"
[3:08:37] <%CalderGaming> this guy voted for biden all the way through the primary process and general election
[3:08:38] <%StevorenoElcamino> Shepard looks kinda like Redd Foreman.
[3:08:41] <Meekest> Wow a whole +4 Renegade
[3:08:42] <+MightyDuckShoes> Sheppat looks so fucking mad
[3:08:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> Jacob is the new Ashley. We must bully him.
[3:08:44] <peachy996> Stop Saluting you're not military
[3:08:45] <Blank9> he doesn't even have the same trauma with biotics that kaidan does
[3:08:45] <sekihoe> aww, you'll break his heart... good
[3:08:47] <%TheotherKristian> Godang, Pat
[3:08:47] <$LightningLynx89> Jacob literally is inoffensive
[3:08:48] <%kewlmyc> Why are you Renegade only to him?
[3:08:52] <Essixian> @kewlmyc Yeah, he's not super interesting but he's fair enough. I like his honesty.
[3:08:52] <IndoorSitup> Pat you jerk
[3:08:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can easily max out Paragon yeah.
[3:08:57] <zerointelligence000> Damn, I'm not even doing renegade for him
[3:08:58] <Zantetzuken> hol up
[3:08:59] <Halospaz117> @StevorenoElcamino Gonna put his foot up the reaper's asses
[3:08:59] <+athuramn> why can I not remember Kasumi at all x_x
[3:09:01] <Sigma_190_Beta> @LightningLynx89 Not even, he gets worse.
[3:09:01] <+dylin456> did pat save wrex
[3:09:02] <%GarbageNirvana> So is Jacob the new Ashley for this playthrough
[3:09:03] <RetributionP> I don't this he deserves it that bad
[3:09:06] <+pally_din> I think it's fine if you don't make major renegade decisions
[3:09:06] <%QueequegTheater> @kewlmyc because he cheats on FemShep, he deserves it
[3:09:08] <peachy996> Basically bullying a slice of bread.
[3:09:11] <%AncelDeLambert> THIS IS UTTER BULLSHIT
[3:09:11] <%QueequegTheater> @athuramn she was DLC
[3:09:12] <seancbo> @QueequegTheater "autism blackface" LUL LUL
[3:09:14] <%LumberjackJack> @dylin456 Yup
[3:09:14] <%tyler274> ENTANGLEMENT DOESNT WORK LIKE THAT
[3:09:15] <%ingman112> @queequegtheater What an awful take
[3:09:15] <+MightyDuckShoes> @patstaresat  Remember.... They don't "all" have to survive the suicide mission...
[3:09:15] <thetunnelhomer> Kasumi feels like she's in a different game
[3:09:17] <therealtacopancakes> Jacob is a chill dude, why the hate?
[3:09:17] <DatAsuna> I love quantum entanglement
[3:09:18] <%AncelDeLambert> QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THIS
[3:09:21] <%Varlinator> You got room to sneak in a few Renegade replies
[3:09:23] <$LightningLynx89> @GarbageNirvana Jacob isn't even Spacist
[3:09:23] <+bugz_munny> we have space rollback
[3:09:27] <RetributionP> pats not fem shep tbo
[3:09:28] <+Nomad_Scholar> Lag free, huh
[3:09:28] <AthenaAegis> Does it have Rollback? Kappa
[3:09:28] <HaroldDonchee> give me tacyons
[3:09:29] <+dylin456> @LumberjackJack thanks
[3:09:30] <+athuramn> @queequegtheater ahh, makes sense. ty
[3:09:34] <James_Quivers> this conference room has rollback netcode
[3:09:35] <xcompleasedad> @AncelDeLambert How does it work?
[3:09:37] <+pmtriox> IMAGINE THAT
[3:09:38] <ToneBacas> still, no delay
[3:09:39] <peachy996> @QueequegTheater Any Femshep dumb enough to pick Jacob over Garrus deserves it
[3:09:39] <ape_hawk> better call Space Comcast
[3:09:39] <Sigma_190_Beta> @GarbageNirvana He's worse. At least Ashley changes over the games a bit for the better. However Jacob just gets worse.
[3:09:40] <%spitelite> it uses blitz netcode
[3:09:40] <filialpails> 1 qubit/s
[3:09:43] <peachy996> Suck it
[3:09:43] <Essixian> @AncelDeLambert SHUSH
[3:09:44] <%tyler274> i SUFFERED THROUGH QUANTUM MECHANICS IM A LICENSED QUANTUM MECHANICS
[3:09:45] <Halospaz117> Ok but can it play Guilty Gear?
[3:09:45] <+pmtriox> I WONDER IF THAT WILL COME UP LATER
[3:09:46] <DSD24> Just do all the renegade interupts
[3:09:48] <RrenKrieg> jacob's only an asshole if you're femshep, he's cool if you're manshep
[3:09:50] <%RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater How is Overlord "Autism blackface"? For one, it's not being played for laughs at all. For two, I'm not sure if it's ever stated that David is autistic. For three, the entire thing is about how Cerberus DOESN'T consider him a person and how fucking awful it is.
[3:09:56] <mar_krow> jacob bad break up simulator done well or bad
[3:09:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Pats Views: Racism and cheating on your girlfriend are on the same level of bad

[3:10:18] <%OrangeMDT> @QueequegTheater I thought femshep and him just hook up tho. Are they exclusive?
[3:10:19] <%AncelDeLambert> @xcompleasedad you take two particles that are entangled to two different locations. Once you observe (measure) one particle, you instantly know the state of the paired particle. The entanglement is thus BROKEN
[3:10:19] <%NateyBeak> edi loves when people donate bits
[3:10:20] <+LastnameSilverLastname> A STRING AND TWO CANS!
[3:10:24] <RetributionP> Pat hate Jacob for somthing he hasn't done yet

[3:10:42] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> Mark them as read
[3:10:43] <%NateyBeak> @PatStaresAt they only made it this big to fit mirandas double wide surprise
[3:10:43] <%RubberFistFight> @AncelDeLambert You can't transmit information with it though.
[3:10:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt You need to mark the messages as read.
[3:10:45] <+Shubreaker> mark em as read
[3:10:45] <%DJFakie> Need to Mark as Read
[3:10:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> Too bad there is literally a result called the NO COMMUNICATION THEOREM, which makes that super impossible.
[3:10:47] <Sigma_190_Beta> You have to mark things as read.
[3:10:47] <+pmtriox> she says that no matter if you saw it already
[3:10:48] <+AmericanSkidd> dont believe her lies
[3:10:50] <%Monkeyweed21> MARK AS READ
[3:10:52] <xcompleasedad> @AncelDeLambert So it literally only lasts for the one qubit? LUL
[3:10:52] <peachy996> Like Thane is great but it ends in tragedy
[3:10:58] <Broken_Sonex> @QueequegTheater They do say David has autism i'm sure
[3:10:59] <%Piemono> Is it weird to like EDI more in ME2 than ME3?

[3:11:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's still weird that you have a fish tank BEFORE you buy fish.
[3:11:25] <%Monkeyweed21> FISH TANK
[3:11:26] <+AmericanSkidd> My fuck room
[3:11:27] <sekihoe> edi will watch you wank
[3:11:27] <+MightyDuckShoes> @piemono No. I liked that she was a ship more too.
[3:11:31] <+pmtriox> i can't even enjoy any of these games because everything in them is dropped in 3 because they never bothered to think about it.
[3:11:34] <+bugz_munny> awww yeah fish time

[3:12:10] <Mangahero18> TALI IS BEST GIRL
[3:12:10] <+Shubreaker> catJam
[3:12:11] <James_Quivers> Use it to spank Tali
[3:12:12] <%Eaglestrike117> who are you shagging this time? Tali?
[3:12:12] <spawnzie> catJAM
[3:12:13] <ZeroWhitewolfx> time to cheat on Liara
[3:12:14] <knight_verse> LLPOK AT THE CEILING ABOVE THE BED
[3:12:15] <%dekkitout> Dance like a jerk, do it
[3:12:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Throw that picture in the trash

[3:12:18] <Sigma_190_Beta> PUT ON SEX MUSIC!
[3:12:18] <+Mahbonk> setting up the atmosphere
[3:12:19] <+pmtriox> if you dislike liara why'd you bone her?
[3:12:20] <%Eilocke> you can get advantages out of quantum entanglement like quantum pseudo-telepathy, but unfortunately you can't send actual information faster than light
[3:12:22] <+liquidzr0> liara is great you monster
[3:12:24] <knight_verse> Look*
[3:12:27] <%MidnightBurst12> Gotta get that groove going
[3:12:28] <peachy996> Pat why do you have a framed picture of your leftovers?
[3:12:29] <HaroldDonchee> so funny they built this huge fishtank then said nah let that fuck get his own fish. I'm not filling that thing
[3:12:30] <twistedj3ster> human music...i like it
[3:12:30] <Broken_Sonex> Ah yes the place people use for their SFM porn.
[3:12:32] <%LumberjackJack> ME1 music, sure, why not?
[3:12:33] <%AncelDeLambert> @xcompleasedad those aren't entangled particles, not the way that's being mentioned.
[3:12:34] <%machshop> moon roof PogChamp
[3:12:36] <Archmortal> if it weren't for Tali, Liara would be like, second best with her massive writing glow-up in Shadowbroker and ME3
[3:12:37] <mar_krow> gotta keep my fishes alive
[3:12:38] <Meekest> That seems absurdly dangerous in the captains room
[3:12:38] <+InhumanMilitia> their is an easter egg if you romance liara in all three games
[3:12:39] <sekihoe> Liara is not even the hottest asari
[3:12:39] <%dekkitout> Does it count as a moon roof if youre in space?
[3:12:40] <%QueequegTheater> Oh wow I never noticed the window
[3:12:40] <DSD24> Windows are not relevant
[3:12:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Fuck under the stars
[3:12:42] <$antibonehurtingjuice> structural weakness*
[3:12:46] <+Ropcord> structural weakness DansGame
[3:12:46] <DSD24> How can they be real
[3:12:47] <Jaysky> Fuck this is just making me want to replay ME2 again goddamit
[3:12:48] <%RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater I still don't think it's a damaging portrayal, because his plight is directly shown to be as a result of the horrible experiments done on him, and if you meet him in 3, he's actually a very capable dude who is doing good things and being displayed very positively.
[3:12:48] <%Xelhesia> that seems so not safe
[3:12:48] <+GamerWorlock> Structural weakness
[3:12:49] <%Varlinator> @pmtriox Who else was he gonna bang in 1? LUL
[3:12:50] <xcompleasedad> @AncelDeLambert Huh. OK
[3:12:51] <Mangahero18> @pmtriox cause you cant get with Tali in the first game and Liara is the second best female option.
[3:12:52] <spawnzie> and no birds to shit on it!
[3:12:54] <thetunnelhomer> Do you start out with any cool armor or is it just the N7 stuff?
[3:12:54] <twistedj3ster> paige would shit
[3:12:55] <stantheman_97> you can see the stars as you smash alien ass
[3:12:57] <%OldOnyx> space windows don't seem like  great idea
[3:12:58] <+Mahbonk> in space no can see you fuck. Except from that window
[3:12:59] <+Shubreaker> ooh actual jams
[3:12:59] <Too_Much_Nukie> Transparent aluminum.
[3:13:01] <+liquidzr0> @sekihoe it's either samara or aria
[3:13:04] <logothete2401> That's Noveria
[3:13:08] <mar_krow> z target weak spot
[3:13:10] <%Varlinator> Noveria
[3:13:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Asari don't start getting hot till their like 5000
[3:13:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> @thetunnelhomer The Legendary Edition makes you buy all the DLC armor.
[3:13:13] <DSD24> Samara is the hottest
[3:13:16] <MrPandastic> Man, that's a worrying structural weakpoint.
[3:13:16] <jbrachob> paige would loose her mind with a space window above her bead
[3:13:17] <peachy996> Liara is a terribly inept Shadow Broker
[3:13:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> In-game buy not with real money.
[3:13:20] <AthenaAegis> Galaxy Map theme is the only ME music you need Kreygasm

[3:13:32] <Halospaz117> hehe, pepe
[3:13:32] <%dekkitout> That is a narrow ass communal shower stall
[3:13:35] <%QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight Autistic people are not supercomputers, that's not at all how the disorder works. Even well-intentioned misinformation is still damaging

[3:14:28] <+pmtriox> I'm not liking that people's immediate answer to my question is "well they have to fuck someone" when fucking is a choice
[3:14:30] <+AmericanSkidd> did the drive core shake that much before the remaster?

[3:14:56] <%RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater No they're not, and David wasn't either. The reason they hooked him into the computer was because of his grasp of mathematics and the way his brain collated and interpreted the data. It was specifically the MATHEMATICAL SAVANT part they were utilising, and that's totally a thing. Just obviously future-bullshited up with robot brain technology.
[3:14:57] <%QueequegTheater> @athuramn the Overlord DLC did
[3:14:59] <+Buzzkill983> I like that the Illusive man specifically chose his least racist and nicest members of Cerberus to crew the Normandy

[3:16:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> Gardner is the only one I can think of who is 100% into the Cerberus racism bullshit.

[3:22:53] <moonmeh> they had the butt shot and didn't bother to do the rest
[3:22:55] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt yeah because it was lazily done to please the complainers that weren't gonna play the game in the first place.

[3:23:08] <hanna_dama> Uh oh
[3:23:08] <%LumberjackJack> It's not this scene. You're thinking to when she gives you her loyalty mission
[3:23:09] <+Shubreaker> she was always stanced like that
[3:23:11] <peachy996> A posing is cool
[3:23:12] <%wibbwobbler> Hmmm

[3:23:18] <Broken_Sonex> @Ravioli_Ronin No nothing has been changed to the model it's just camera shots
[3:23:18] <Pookiedaexzile> CALL HER A GENETIC FREAK!
[3:23:19] <+natenomm> Miranda's edging
[3:23:24] <%RubberFistFight> @TourettesPlays nah it's not censorship. It IS cowardice, though.
[3:23:28] <%justnathan18> Her outfit would be 50% less sexual if the pants were a differnet color than the top
[3:23:28] <+skeletonmilk> TIGHT ASSHOLE
[3:23:30] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god I can't read the on screen subtitles, they bleed into her stupid costume
[3:23:30] <SivShele> Is she standing on her chair??
[3:23:32] <%Monkeyweed21> THE A STANDS FOR ASS
[3:23:32] <peachy996> She's a Scott Steiner
[3:23:32] <$lotharrio> She's genetically superior... but not in anyway that actually makes her better than anyone.
[3:23:34] <KCfusecoast> Lemme me see YOUR BOOTY
[3:23:35] <%Gamblitz> Miranda is kahn
[3:23:36] <Mangahero18> Is Miranda's voice actor different? She sounds less british than before.
[3:23:37] <+AmericanSkidd> Genetically perfect ass
[3:23:38] <RetributionP> can you photomode in cutscenes?
[3:23:39] <akitanito> so she's an alien
[3:23:40] <%Varlinator> Implants
[3:23:42] <MildMannered_Creighton> half again?
[3:23:43] <spike_j_wolfwood> we're going have to go into camera mode for the butt fix.
[3:23:43] <%dekkitout> Does she have an adamantium skeleton?

[3:23:52] <Broken_Sonex> @TourettesPlays 100%
[3:23:54] <KCfusecoast> Miranda is Khan
[3:23:55] <quipquest1> She's a humonculous
[3:23:55] <+SilverDevilfish> She is literally a Gundam SEED
[3:24:00] <TheSaltminer> SHE'S A GENETIC FREAK, AND SHE AIN'T NORMAL, SEE YOU AT SACKAFICE SHEPARD
[3:24:01] <+Maldoree> Betcha shes infertile
[3:24:05] <%Mekhet09> You know "For a human" biotics are pretty much the same as every other race. They should have actually had some fucking variation in levels.
[3:24:05] <%RubberFistFight> @Mangahero18 No, and she was never british. VA's Yvonne Strahovski, and she's an Aussie. She sounds exactly the same.
[3:24:06] <parkslady> aw happy kitty
[3:24:07] <+MightyDuckShoes> @rubberfistfight Or maybe they were too embarrassed by the first volley of memes to want a repeat layered with it being 2021? So yeah, "outrage" and just people having taste
[3:24:09] <%mikeriffic> @ape_hawk noooooooooooooooooo
[3:24:09] <%ComfortableStranger> @Gamblitz or Dr Bashir

[3:25:25] <Essixian> @RubberFistFight @MightyDuckShoes Honestly, the ass shots were pretty juvenile. Offense or no, it was gratuitous and unnecessary.
[3:25:25] <$masneo2> dr.chakwas is so classy
[3:25:29] <HaroldDonchee> she gives me big Judi dench vibes
[3:25:34] <%ComfortableStranger> "whats this about you teaming up with reapers to abduct women?"
[3:25:34] <%RubberFistFight> @MightyDuckShoes Oh no, not the memes, whatever will they do 🙄 Also lol at it being [CURRENT YEAR] somehow making any kind of difference. Because cgi butts are bad now or something I guess.
[3:25:37] <cellaccount> mars sucked

[3:26:59] <SpaceGuntank> Chakwas really is a great character
[3:26:59] <+Memequisition> ah the weird head this is still around
[3:27:03] <%Varlinator> Chakwas should've been romanceable

[3:27:25] <James_Quivers> THAT IRISH FUCK DONNELLY
[3:27:26] <Essixian> @RubberFistFight I honestly think you're overthinking this. Nobody would give a shit if they left the ass shots in after all this time. They just removed them because they were unnecessarily gratuitous.
[3:27:28] <%Kitafin> orb
[3:27:29] <Case_Ah_Dia> O R B

[3:27:42] <moonmeh> best pair
[3:27:43] <+MightyDuckShoes> @rubberfistfight I'm agreeing it's a different time? Time passes?  Also, your right. Any romance options with Chakwas could only happen if the camera was snugly fitted right in her clam. It's the only way. Filmschool basics

[3:28:37] <%RubberFistFight> @MightyDuckShoes Cool so if it's a different time then why did they only remove that one shot and not address the NUMEROUS OTHER EXAMPLES of objectification in the game, including but not limited to the MALE objectification present in the character of Vega?
[3:28:38] <sekihoe> cant mine bitcoin with the core as it is
[3:28:39] <ToneBacas> Scotty, can we do Warp factor 9?
[3:28:39] <%shadowsofpain> I know a man that knows a good Calibration

[3:29:45] <%Varlinator> Ah yes "Reapers"
[3:29:46] <+yashpar> @RubberFistFight didn't you just call them prudes? Shouldn't you be defending the objectification of Vega to own the prudes?  😂
[3:29:50] <plaguedoctor_syan> We need to make a video about Mother 3
[3:29:50] <emmmdeekay> Politics are shit, time to join the Space KKK
[3:29:51] <HaroldDonchee> "oh shepherds dead? yeah that reaper shit was stupid"
[3:29:51] <DSD24> Nice scars
[3:29:52] <Archmortal> this crew works so hard to make Cerberus seem okay
[3:29:53] <stantheman_97> bureaucracy fucking sucks bro
[3:29:53] <%valriot> ??? What?
[3:29:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[3:29:54] <peachy996> There's a lot of dissatisfied Alliance folks in Cerberus by 2
[3:29:54] <$RealThiele> RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM
[3:29:54] <James_Quivers> mass effect is based like that
[3:29:55] <Profmcstevie> SUITS ARE USELESS
[3:29:56] <+TopTieramisu> only terrorism can beat the reapers
[3:29:57] <SaltyAzteca> Mass Effect 3: All the Warriors
[3:29:57] <Essixian> WE ALL NEED TO BE TERRORISTS, IT'S THE ONLY WAY
[3:29:57] <JoshyJay> YEAH BASED
[3:29:58] <+michingmallecho> hasRaid

[3:30:14] <%MidnightBurst12> if everyone's a terrorist then we win
[3:30:15] <+AmericanSkidd> Thank You Ken, Very Cool
[3:30:19] <Jaysky> "Partners"
[3:30:21] <+faytthepally> Based and cerberus pilled
[3:30:24] <tanarath> HARD CHOICES MUST BE MADE
[3:30:24] <mar_krow> me3 end game
[3:30:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> You kids banging?
[3:30:29] <$RealThiele> Cerberus shrugged
[3:30:32] <%valriot> Pat, you kill the shit out of Cerberus. The entirety of ME3 is you slapping aliens around to make them work together
[3:30:32] <akitanito> TIM: look at all these nice cerberus pepes!
[3:30:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> Nobody has sex on my ship but me.
[3:30:42] <AngryAsian5> Nah, they don't fuck until ME3 LUL
[3:30:43] <%Dylveryn> State of the art with discontinued parts?
[3:30:46] <dd44dostivei> these are pretty cute cryptofaschs
[3:30:47] <%Gamblitz> Gabby: Kenneth is like my brother and thats hot!
[3:30:48] <%dekkitout> Was it so hard for the crew to be a cerberus offshoot? "Yeah, we don't like Cerberus anymore, so we stole this ship and you"
[3:30:48] <%spoiledbadger> daddy bags
[3:30:49] <DatAsuna> You can have it so daniels dies in ME2 and Donnaly has PTSD in 3 as a result.
[3:30:50] <%LumberjackJack> DADDY BAGS
[3:30:50] <+faytthepally> DID YOU KNOW I'M IRISH?
[3:30:53] <%HitchhikingThrough> Yeah
[3:30:54] <TheSaltminer> DADDY BAGS
[3:30:54] <+InternetShis> That's a saying
[3:30:55] <moonmeh> yuuup
[3:30:57] <Jaysky> Miranda
[3:30:58] <nuane> except miranda
[3:30:59] <+ratchetex> huh
[3:31:02] <stantheman_97> yeah
[3:31:02] <peachy996> It's almost as if they were handpicked
[3:31:03] <AllenDeadman> mhm
[3:31:03] <TheSaltminer> he's fuckin Scottish
[3:31:03] <filialpails> right in the bawbag
[3:31:04] <akitanito> it's deliberate
[3:31:05] <dd44dostivei> and gardner
[3:31:06] <+pally_din> yeah, and she's not great
[3:31:06] <srv4254> ya fuckin spa
[3:31:06] <Parapattern> And we hate her
[3:31:07] <%DashXero> What about the cook?
[3:31:10] <+MightyDuckShoes> @rubberfistfight Sure. "cowardice" Not Miranda looking weird and her ass being a weird blob of polygons that people wouldn't stop making fun of. That's what it is. Also nice MRA talking point about Vega...The silent victim
[3:31:11] <Zalapski> and even that changes
[3:31:12] <+AmericanSkidd> They hand picked the crew to fit Shepard
[3:31:12] <RetributionP> and the cook
[3:31:12] <Meekest> And you like Miranda way more than Jacob OMEGALUL
[3:31:15] <%dekkitout> Does Cerberus just pay that well?
[3:31:16] <$LightningLynx89> Jacob is just a soldier guy.
[3:31:16] <+faytthepally> Wish I had a fuckdesk
[3:31:16] <%justnathan18> Jacob is just casually racist
[3:31:17] <Pookiedaexzile> YEAH
[3:31:19] <ssulcer> idi?
[3:31:19] <+pmtriox> and Miranda dumps Cerberus like a sack of shit at the first opportunity too
[3:31:20] <sekihoe> mirand is drunk on delusive man dyak juice though
[3:31:20] <%LumberjackJack> And even Miranda turns by the end of ME2
[3:31:22] <+black_pariah> chat why are you all engaging with this parody of a dudebro, fuckin ignore him and let the bitch whine
[3:31:23] <Pookiedaexzile> CREEPY FUCK DEASK
[3:31:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> I'm sure TIM handpicked the most sympathetic moderates
[3:31:24] <%zyberion626> when is a janitor NOT racist
[3:31:24] <peachy996> It's almost as if they were all handpicked to get you to trust them
[3:31:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt There's a note about it in 3. The Illusive Man picked people who were mostly former Alliance Military so that Shepard would change his mind about Cerberus.
[3:31:28] <DatAsuna> Gardner STAYS after 2 finishes
[3:31:28] <Jaysky> It's like Illusive Man hired a bunch of people to get on your good side or something
[3:31:29] <emmmdeekay> Yeah but gardner is a boomer
[3:31:29] <akitanito> the cook only hates batarians, he's fineeeee
[3:31:30] <%Varlinator> Imagine if your whole crew was racist! psaBig ohnPanic
[3:31:31] <HaroldDonchee> maybe cerberus isn't really that bad?
[3:31:32] <dd44dostivei> i think it's even mentioned to be intentional choice by TIM
[3:31:34] <Basch71> they're ideally more your crew than cerberus' despite working for them
[3:31:35] <%HitchhikingThrough> I like how they had to make miranda the racist one for it to even be close to a contest
[3:31:39] <moonmeh> yuup
[3:31:39] <stantheman_97> it's either join the human supremacists or just die
[3:31:40] <%wibbwobbler> Anything for shepherd
[3:31:41] <%DashXero> The cook seems to be enjoying the Kool-Aid.
[3:31:42] <+InternetShis> "If you betray us, I'll blow up your brain. Check out my perfect arse, Shepard. Does it make you wanna work for pro-human terrorists?"
[3:31:42] <thetunnelhomer> Engaging with who, what?
[3:31:45] <$RealThiele> LUL
[3:31:46] <Jaysky> That was a lie
[3:31:48] <Sigma_190_Beta> I mean... all this means is that Cerberus handpicked stuff @PatStaresAt
[3:31:50] <+GamerWorlock> Lol
[3:31:50] <%skeleklng> Have you been seeing some of the shit people have been finding in the Cyberpunk source code? Bunch of stuff mentioning not having enough time to fix certain problems

[3:33:08] <%Gamblitz> Urdak... what a name!
[3:33:10] <Halospaz117> BEST MINIGAME
[3:33:11] <DSD24> Probing lets goooo

[3:33:16] <%Varlinator> Awwwwwww yeah
[3:33:16] <twistedj3ster> couldn't they just send down a probe?
[3:33:16] <mar_krow> find the sweet spot mini game
[3:33:18] <+michingmallecho> Scan it so hard the planet breaks
[3:33:18] <TLKingRichard> Imagine using Fuel in the 23rd century KEKW
[3:33:18] <%LumberjackJack> THE HYPEST GAMEPLAY ON TWITCH, FUCK YEAH
[3:33:19] <%justnathan18> This probe shit takes way too long
[3:33:24] <Halospaz117> ITS SO ODDLY RELAXING
[3:33:25] <%ssjklyco> It's that Scanner they didnt have in Andromeda
[3:33:25] <%maenos2> i found the scanning thing oddly soothing and easy to lose myself in
[3:33:25] <%RubberFistFight> @MightyDuckShoes I love how the only thing you've got is throwing out accusations of group membership. Gamergate, mra, etc. You gonna accuse me of being "alt right" next? If people are gonna bitch about perceived objectification but stay totally silent on examples of it simply due to the gender on display, it's nothing but moral guardianship and cowardice. Objectification is objectification, regardless of what the focus has in their pants or on their chest, end of story. Either it's all bad or n
[3:33:26] <+red_cuppa> gonna be real i still prefer the mako
[3:33:27] <hat_under_bread> I envy your ability to forget this fucking chore.
[3:33:27] <quipquest1> My OCD demands I probe EVERY PLANET
[3:33:27] <dd44dostivei> DON'T BOTHER WITH GAS GIANTS
[3:33:28] <+bugz_munny> rub that planet
[3:33:30] <%Varlinator> Get those SWEET SWEET STACKS!!
[3:33:31] <fugly_nick> If I replay this game, I'm probably just gonna use a mod to skip the planet probing

[3:33:31] <ape_hawk> itll tell you
[3:33:31] <%ComfortableStranger> don't forget to probe uranus

[3:35:14] <otakon17> Best thing to do is scan planets with either RICH or GOOD Scanner Results and stop at POOR so you don't waste too many probes, make sure to do it at the BIGGEST spikes.

[3:36:35] <+MightyDuckShoes> @rubberfistfight Because it's a basic bitch tactic to always point out some thing miniscule and treat it like it's somehow the same. Who the hell has ever mentioned Vega, and is this "objectification" also hilarious? because if not, I do not care and neither does Bioware. I remember people laughing at Vega being huge. That's it. I wouldn't know what you even are on about. You've been complaining about Miranda since the ME1 playthrough.
