[0:13:47] <Blackleafx> I just arrived
[0:13:49] <+JonathLP> It's basically encouraged as a way to sell more WoW Toekns
[0:13:49] <%Evil_John_Cena> but was he getting paid from them?
[0:13:51] <%BloodyBurney> It only uses ingame gold, is my undersanding
[0:13:53] <aleexynder> not if you pay in wow gold? SeemsGood
[0:13:53] <%MidnightBurst12> LUL

[0:14:18] <+Vampireinarm> @Delenay that can very easily be turned into real cash
[0:14:20] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt can you translate of non mmo nerds
[0:14:27] <%Wallabri> Gold... that you can buy with cash?
[0:14:27] <%BloodyBurney> gold, but YOU CAN BUY GOLD WITH CASH LEGIT
[0:14:32] <aleexynder> maybe the "clear" is just a kind of... proverb?
[0:14:35] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU CAN BUY GOLD WITH WOW TOKENS SO BOTH I GUESS
[0:14:35] <+JonathLP> @PatStaresAt Gold, but you can buy Gold with Cash indirectly with WoW Token.

[0:14:58] <+JustToWatch> thanks
[0:15:07] <%RealThiele> some nerd will come beat Sundowner for you
[0:15:11] <Spagheddies> I'm guessing it's essentially paying for getting carried.
[0:15:13] <+bluestbee> SELLING TEA/E12S CLEAR DISCORD FOR INFO
[0:15:48] <+twig_blight> Hey chat, does anyone know what happened to the Csb vod?
[0:15:48] <%notsoy> 10 or 25
[0:15:50] <%afronooch> 100% why I did Eureka lol
[0:15:52] <%BloodyBurney> 20, i think
[0:15:54] <+orochiblood> @miucsa51 because wow is older and has been around much longer
[0:15:59] <%bevyrage> @miucsa51 drugs bruv
[0:16:05] <%Nordguy> @miucsa51 ff14 doesn't look like wow
[0:16:06] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:16:08] <+Delenay> 20 for the hardest
[0:16:08] <Visorak6> And get paid like 600 bucks
[0:16:10] <%RealThiele> fomo the achhieveos
[0:16:14] <$spardanwarrior> @PatStaresAt "Likely streaming our heroic SoD sales run and high'ish end m+ tonight (20-23) starting at 5pm PT" straight from Mike Ybarra's twitter
[0:16:17] <%Rafferty3231> what the ACTUAL fuck
[0:16:21] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Cha-ching
[0:16:21] <dukenux> deal Kappa
[0:16:25] <%Bluwizard21> i remember those scams
[0:16:25] <ohno778> That's pitiful
[0:16:26] <SaltyAzteca> So brave, so crazy, thats a lucrative business??
[0:16:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt High-end raiding in WoW is so crazy expensive in Shadowlands that raiding guilds kinda HAVE to sell clears to avoid a deficit btw
[0:16:40] <%twistedj3ster> they won't just LET YOU in their group???
[0:16:40] <+windsoc> oh man, i thought selling clears was just paying for a slot to get carried through it
[0:16:42] <%sonuke_draws> sonuke_draws subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 
[0:16:44] <Spagheddies> Wait, hold on. So, letting other people log into your account IS NOT against WoW's TOS?
[0:16:51] <dukenux> let you log back into your account? you mean MY account? :)
[0:16:52] <%notsoy> to clarify, raids are currently 10-man or 20/25-man, in vanilla they were 40
[0:17:09] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt imagine if your completed relic was a neccessity for Savages and Ultimates
[0:17:10] <lvl10cybermancer> If it's for in-game currency what's stopping them from just robbing you of everything after you give them your login?
[0:17:11] <+Vampireinarm> sounds like wow is  stupid fucken game to me then LUL
[0:17:12] <ShoMibu> lumituSquish am i late! hi pat!
[0:17:18] <%RealThiele> easilythey had too much gold in the economy and are making the WoW
[0:17:21] <%NopeBadguy> who gives a fuck if they're hard, just do them
[0:17:21] <%dekkitout> Did wow ever resolve the spit emote thing?
[0:17:23] <%notsoy> yeah, if you have a raid on farm you can definitely carry deadweight
[0:17:25] <%RealThiele> grindy
[0:17:25] <%ThirdWelles> From what I've heard from my friends, less so than XIV
[0:17:26] <%rekinom> It's 20 people for the highest difficulty, they just have you die at the start of the fight @PatStaresAt
[0:17:28] <SaltyAzteca> @dukenux Thats what I was thinking too LUL
[0:17:33] <%BoxNavy> @Monkeyweed21 WHAT
[0:17:35] <%RonaldMcDownload> ppl carry my ass in ff14 all the time
[0:17:41] <%saiyanblitz> Good evening everyone
[0:17:44] <%ThirdWelles> That's fucking incredible
[0:17:44] <@GeneralSCPatton> I assumed it was just the carry. Didn't realize people would go for the login.
[0:17:47] <+orochiblood> @lvl10cybermancer if its for real money, theyll probably give you your account back. they want to keep making irl money.
[0:17:51] <%blastyoboots> it's basically ADMITTING YOUR RAIDS SUCK
[0:18:03] <%ChestMimik> "Dying at the start of the fight" seems entirely unfun
[0:18:04] <%Monkeyweed21> @RonaldMcDownload yea but you arent paying for that, they're just being nice
[0:18:04] <%Fooguwu> It's some kind of conflict of interest or something
[0:18:17] <+JonathLP> But Pat, think of the money blizzard could make selling this
[0:18:18] <%RealThiele> but my shiny pony or title tho
[0:18:20] <+Delenay> buy sub tokens for money and sell in game for about 100k gold
[0:18:21] <Spagheddies> Yeah, no, it's kinda scummy without the kinda.
[0:18:30] <T_Sasquatch> Im late, wut happened
[0:18:34] <%afronooch> yep
[0:18:37] <T_Sasquatch> Lemme guess ,,destiny ?
[0:18:42] <IvanMistwalker> VoteYea VoteYea
[0:18:42] <%notsoy> basically, you get to pay your way into things you would otherwise have no fucking chance of ever seeing
[0:18:42] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[0:18:44] <Spagheddies> Games are FAIR people.
[0:18:45] <%RealThiele> and just like the real world, money = shortcut
[0:18:46] <jorniev> get gud if you will
[0:18:47] <Visorak6> No sas
[0:18:50] <%dekkitout> Or just throw money at the problem. Another real world thing
[0:18:53] <peyodogo> @dekkito afaik not only did they not: they started banning other "toxic" emojis and whining on twitter about it
[0:18:54] <%afronooch> wow pres selling clears
[0:18:58] <reonome> GIT GUD
[0:18:59] <Zeif00> "but the statistics say players are engaging with the content" Kappa
[0:18:59] <Spagheddies> @T_Sasquatch WoW co-director selling Raid Clears.
[0:19:01] <lvl10cybermancer> Doesn't this mean that he's basically spotlighting the fact that people don't want to play their raids so badly that they're willing to pay to have someone else do it?
[0:19:02] <%VictorVonLouche> here's a memory card with 100% clear save for $100
[0:19:05] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @T_Sasquatch the new blizz president is selling raid clears in WoW

[0:19:10] <%AgniBrandt> Just got here; what game?
[0:19:16] <SaltyAzteca> Business is business....? I dont even know how to look at it LUL
[0:19:17] <%rekinom> You can buy gold with IRL Cash from blizzard and you can spend gold on blizzard goods including game time @PatStaresAt
[0:19:17] <+blaze__drag> can't be against the TOS at least if you're the CEO
[0:19:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @Spagheddies not wow director the new president of Blizzard
[0:19:23] <T_Sasquatch> @spagheddies @ches_neckbeard LMFAO

[0:19:37] <SaltyAzteca> But it definitely feels scummy LUL
[0:19:38] <%dekkitout> Selling clears like carries or like "We'll fudge the numbers in our books"?
[0:19:39] <staye100> Lmao
[0:19:40] <%BloodyBurney> out of curiosity, do you think theres a difference between buying clears and just being popular enough to play with really good people?
[0:19:41] <gslayer14> GOT DAMN
[0:19:42] <SpookyMooks> absolute fucker
[0:19:42] <+pectusumbra> I've got a joke for everyone: WoW

[0:19:53] <%Schrodingers_Box> Gotta pay for the Lawsuit somehow
[0:19:54] <reonome> thats what it takes to be president i guess LUL
[0:19:55] <staye100> Where is the tweet?
[0:20:00] <+orochiblood> there's not many articles about it, ive only seen one so far
[0:20:04] <nocturnPhoenix> That goes beyond the pale
[0:20:08] <Spagheddies> It's sad-funny.

[0:21:15] <%GarbageNirvana> SMN LOOKS SICK
[0:21:17] <LilacsandFreedom> started actually bothering with Summoner after seeing the changes
[0:21:17] <%ThirdWelles> Holding off Levelling SMN until the rework.
[0:21:18] <%furiousfurioso> all of the job changes look sick
[0:21:22] <ShoMibu> demo was great. i miss demos.
[0:21:27] <+orochiblood> Xenos says whoever is messing with DRK should be fired and I kinda agree.
[0:21:32] <SaltyAzteca> Nice
[0:21:32] <%ThirdWelles> Apparently they're changing their baby buttons too
[0:21:35] <T_Sasquatch> Im most excited in monk because i like suffering but im hype for most jobs

[0:21:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @T_Sasquatch chakra at 30 and blitz at 60 is gonna be crazy
[0:22:03] <%orochiblood> orochiblood subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[0:22:03] <+Ancisace> You're giving money to Pat? It only encourages him.

[0:22:15] <T_Sasquatch> @orochiblood but enhanced MEND THO !
[0:22:20] <+paradiseislands> DRK sucked in shb too lul
[0:22:22] <T_Sasquatch> Unmend fuck
[0:22:24] <Spagheddies> Is avoiding Invisible War mind goblins, or just good taste?
[0:22:28] <+nictron90> Also the fact that the first 'stealth' weapon is a crossbow that takes about 5 minutes to kill someone while they run around screaming the whole time
[0:22:33] <SpookyMooks> i think im just not a fan of 3rd person shooters
[0:22:36] <HotMafia81> It kinda do.  You get used to it, but yeah
[0:22:38] <%BoxNavy> as someone that picked up ninja recently im really looking forward to the EW changes
[0:22:41] <+Vampireinarm> time to spam unmend to get more gap closers!

[0:22:48] <%Bailey__Gaming> Superman can't get you if you eat all the cakes
[0:22:55] <bakkatohri> People like DE:HR/MD, but hate the Thief reboot. They're pretty similar imo.
[0:22:57] <Rionxgarland> need to get all moogle treasures
[0:23:00] <SpookyMooks> boy i love math
[0:23:06] <lvl10cybermancer> It's worth it to play the Malkavian Mod for sure though
[0:23:08] <T_Sasquatch> I've played this game for a year and i have only 2 jobs not at 80. I still don't know shit about this game
[0:23:08] <+bluestbee> SCH Sprint Memes aside the skill looks great, a movespeed upgrade tied to a partywide 10% damage mitigation? Sounds great
[0:23:13] <%crimsonharvest> @PatStaresAt sorry for being wildly OT but do you get nausea from those occasional migraines? what do you do about it?
[0:23:17] <%BloodyBurney> i just wish we had scourge

[0:24:16] <Madovir> dark knight can not die
[0:24:18] <@Ranryu692> you would think the class with the shield would have the biggest defense
[0:24:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Fine by me
[0:24:23] <LoreKeeper_Thal> pretty fucking much
[0:24:24] <potatopsychic> @boxnavy that fluff on the top!

[0:24:34] <TheMorilo> I feel like they just gave up on DRK
[0:24:35] <nocturnPhoenix> Seems like it. I'm a DRK main and I guess I should level another tank
[0:24:40] <T_Sasquatch> I feel like that's on purpose
[0:24:42] <%WhereIsWill> its PLD/GNB thats the true combo
[0:24:47] <+bluestbee> Oh I would LOVE putting my Heart of Corundum on a warrior
[0:24:51] <@Ranryu692> thats fine with me, main tanking has been easier so far
[0:24:53] <Hypnotoad0823> Pat you see Cheryl is getting a james sunderland skin in DBD
[0:24:53] <LoreKeeper_Thal> nice, that's good
[0:24:53] <Treasure_Vault> You hear how all the achievos in this are named after Magic The Gathering card?
[0:24:58] <%NeoCre> It’s time to shine baby
[0:25:01] <%GarbageNirvana> I'd rather OT than MT anyway
[0:25:02] <T_Sasquatch> You can mt and ot literally everything.
[0:25:04] <Visorak6> but only three fell cleaves!
[0:25:05] <Madovir> gunbrainlet go HAHA COMBO and then die

[0:25:15] <isolex_> WHAT
[0:25:15] <LoreKeeper_Thal> how about 3 + a FELLEST CLEAVE?
[0:25:16] <%NovaKnightmare> NovaKnightmare subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 54 months! Hey Pat, It's spooki month and I once again lament that there is no good Silent Hill homages out right now. Truly we are the PT demo on PS4 discontinued by Konami. Keep on keeping on!
[0:25:20] <%NeoCre> Time for unlimited blade works
[0:25:20] <T_Sasquatch> But i like seeing crits
[0:25:22] <%Monkeyweed21> @Visorak6 yea but every 60 seconds
[0:25:22] <scientiafidem> Any word on WTF is going on with SMN now?
[0:25:24] <Visorak6> but unga
[0:25:25] <%valriot> All the Tanks look amazing, but DRK just has quirky stuff that feels bad like Living Dead
[0:25:26] <isolex_> HOW DO YOU NOT LIKE FEL CLEAVE
[0:25:33] <bobdoletrasher> why is the stream eternally buffering
[0:25:34] <Madovir> @scientiafidem new job
[0:25:36] <+paradiseislands> idk gnb heart of corundrum is way crazier than tbn +oblation
[0:25:41] <T_Sasquatch> Axe go brrrr
[0:26:13] <%orochiblood> EA?
[0:26:15] <SaltyAzteca> I have more familiarity to the abridged version
[0:26:16] <%NovaKnightmare> Its true, fuck California
[0:26:17] <+Vampireinarm> >potentially LUL
[0:26:19] <%cvp5127> ea or activision?
[0:26:19] <%ThirdWelles> Activision Blizzard
[0:26:20] <%holydeviant1> I am still salty over YGO turning into card games only
[0:26:20] <%ThirdWelles> not EA
[0:26:21] <%orochiblood> you mean activision blizzard
[0:26:22] <%PrimalDweeb> Potentially?
[0:26:24] <mr_saturday93> EA?
[0:26:24] <@SoFarFetched> EA? Activision?
[0:26:28] <%ThirdWelles> Yeah They mean Activision
[0:26:31] <%ThirdWelles> 100%
[0:26:33] <%EmperorStarTurtle> YES
[0:26:36] <%RealThiele> that settlement is being disputed too
[0:26:37] <%PrimalDweeb> LUL
[0:26:41] <raikagelord1> I’m paying Yu-Gi-Oh:Duel links right now. LUL LUL LUL
[0:26:41] <@SoFarFetched> and I thought they said "Oh no you can't get away with just 18 million"
[0:26:42] <%GarbageNirvana> Let's be fair EA might be up to the same thing
[0:26:45] <%Monkeyweed21> that was a bribe and its being investigated right now @PatStaresAt
[0:26:48] <%justcallmebobplease> Is there ANOTHER murder nonsense game company thing going on right now, in California?
[0:26:48] <+Vampireinarm> money
[0:26:49] <lvl10cybermancer> I think that that's been disputed by a judge hasn't it?
[0:26:49] <%NeoCre> Not quite, 18 mill was the max penalty under law
[0:26:49] <Edible_Enthusiasm> wild.
[0:26:50] <%borkmire> for the money
[0:26:50] <%valriot> America
[0:26:53] <@Ranryu692> corruption
[0:26:55] <olm46> I'm sure it's for a profitable cause.
[0:26:56] <%BloodyBurney> because we live in a society
[0:26:57] <%Rafferty3231> because money, duh
[0:26:57] <%EmperorStarTurtle> Sorry I am idiot
[0:27:00] <+xmetalicdemonx> money
[0:27:02] <%SharkMissile> I'm so excited for you to play this
[0:27:03] <%Monkeyweed21> THAT SETTLEMENT WAS SUPER ILLEGAL BTW
[0:27:06] <%greasypete00> because the ,military industrial complex relies on call of duty games to do their propaganda
[0:27:07] <%Bailey__Gaming> Six samurai 4eva
[0:27:09] <@Ranryu692> corruption
[0:27:09] <%Monkeyweed21> rich people
[0:27:10] <+chiazam> @patstaresat Money.
[0:27:10] <%Deekman> prison should be the max penalty that's insane
[0:27:12] <%Frost_Quill> Because the people who make the laws are the ones who would need to destroy evidence most often.
[0:27:12] <%MidnightBurst12> because money
[0:27:12] <+Mrbaconator> cuz the US is corrupt
[0:27:12] <%RealThiele> cause rich people write laws
[0:27:13] <%crimsonharvest> oh let me help you with that, you see the corporations own the law-making apparatus so it follows as obvious
[0:27:14] <%SinnerEbru> shhhh
[0:27:14] <Rionxgarland> fines are for poor people
[0:27:16] <$realm_forge> The US is a shithole
[0:27:17] <%ThirdWelles> I believe the thing is that there's a conflict of interest due to two prosecutors being on both suits
[0:27:17] <%afronooch> Because capitalism
[0:27:19] <%holydeviant1> (Probably because it was put into law aaaaages ago and needs changing?)
[0:27:20] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Because rich people don't like being made to really pay
[0:27:21] <Edible_Enthusiasm> destruction of evidence seems to be a common occurrence in the americas as of late
[0:27:26] <+xmetalicdemonx> oh that's easy it's because of money
[0:27:28] <%Schrodingers_Box> Max Penalty is to stop a smaller business being destroyed into the ground.l
[0:27:34] <%NeoCre> Because the laws were written a long time ago by assholes
[0:27:39] <+Ches_Neckbeard> NDA's cannot cover illegal acts. the US supreme court literally ruled on that in 2018
[0:27:47] <Treasure_Vault> Cause usually it's legal and totally ok to do it
[0:27:50] <%NovaKnightmare> you mean like Capone's tax evasion?
[0:27:52] <@GeneralSCPatton> If you're going to allow destruction of evidence, then you've basically said that it's alright for the biggest liar to win.
[0:27:55] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat is correct on this.
[0:28:02] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> They got Al Capone on tax evasion
[0:28:02] <+megaman_sentinel> man i just open steam 4 the first time 2day an GOW on pc cool
[0:28:10] <%holydeviant1> Ye olde Get Them With The Tax Evasions
[0:28:14] <jorniev> fuck
[0:28:15] <%ChestMimik> That was how they got Capone
[0:28:16] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "off the record"
[0:28:21] <%bob900000> what an idiot
[0:28:22] <T_Sasquatch> Nixon did Gamer gate ?
[0:28:25] <miucsa51> off the record
[0:28:33] <Edible_Enthusiasm> incriminated himself?
[0:28:34] <%RealThiele> back when politicians had some modicum of shame. those days are gone

[0:28:53] <%Sotetsu> Aroooooo
[0:28:59] <+tomdwarf> I like you going back to "The Devil in Devil's Pit!"
[0:28:59] <miucsa51> Devil
[0:29:00] <@Jekado> there is a law that limits corporation pay outs to stop people from doing fraud to get infinite money from companies but it backfired into making corpos not lose as much money from doing stupid shit
[0:29:01] <%dankjerri> the devils pit
[0:29:02] <%ChestMimik> @t_sasquatch okay that's strong
[0:29:02] <%SinnerEbru> nixon did gamergate, im rewriting history
[0:29:03] <%Monkeyweed21> Nixon was a literal Ace Attorney villain
[0:29:04] <TourettesPlays> Ever hear that phonecall between Nixon and Reagan?
[0:29:05] <@Ranryu692> Haroo
[0:29:07] <%bob900000> 10/10 impression
[0:29:07] <OldManDeckardCain> nixon did less bad shiet than obama and yet obama was "scandal-free" LUL
[0:29:07] <%NovaKnightmare> and then Presidents never did anything illegal and nefarious ever again!
[0:29:08] <+garbagegenesis> LETS GO STUPID POLL

[0:31:51] <%valriot> Oh man thats truee oof
[0:31:55] <bakkatohri> Does Eldenring really have to worry about Monster Hunter? Souls-like games seem more mainstream than MH imo.

[0:32:17] <draca23> His finger wags give me strength

[0:33:51] <%Dabrikishaw> What's  INSCRYPTION?
[0:33:53] <Byronic_dreamer> Thank you Pat!
[0:33:56] <T_Sasquatch> My uni only starts class at 9am max
[0:33:58] <%InternetShis> Speaking of D&D, how are Sorcerers in BG3?
[0:33:59] <%TheHateFish> Oh, the 9am hangover maths. Everyone whose done a STEM or STEM-related-humanities degree has done one of those.
[0:34:05] <%Deekman> I'm setting the gcode to record this on my vcr
[0:34:06] <thelonechris> Hello you beautiful gnome
[0:34:13] <%ThirdWelles> it's better in the theater of the mind
[0:34:14] <%ahomeschooldropout> I work at 6am-2:30 and it's pure agony. I might try to get on the graveyard shift thesph1JillSad thesph1JillSad
[0:34:14] <+Ancisace> It's a card game where you sacrifice cards to get the power to summon more powerful ones.
[0:34:16] <evbites> to the twitter artists
[0:34:17] <+mel0dica> yum
[0:34:18] <+Ancisace> Also there's some meta-fuckery
[0:34:18] <Byronic_dreamer> Thank you @thirdwelles
[0:34:25] <cheap_turbo> FrogStaresAt
[0:34:26] <@Ranryu692> you can find plenty of doujinshi that'll recreate that part for you
[0:34:26] <%DovaDude29> @patstaresat the class is on A/C electronics. The only grades for the class is the midterm and finals. In class labs are worth anything other than experience. Feels bad man:(
[0:34:28] <nocturnPhoenix> 6/10 get it a little louder but good technique
[0:34:28] <%InternetShis> That was an airy one
[0:34:31] <draca23> So that's where Gief gets his grossness from.
[0:34:31] <LoreKeeper_Thal> nice
[0:34:32] <%TheHateFish> @InternetShis Considering it's a one-to-one port of 5e, they're decent enough
[0:34:35] <%orochiblood> Destiny doing more fucky wuckys
[0:34:36] <%dankjerri> Kappa1000 hello Pat, i hope you , the burger boy, and your goblins are good. please do a big card

[0:34:38] <%BloodyBurney> oh destiny...
[0:34:39] <@Ranryu692> are you excited for Doc's Cyberpunk essay?
[0:34:42] <%holydeviant1> Destiny is great, there;s always something new to hate!
[0:34:42] <LoneFonte> who isn't LUL
[0:34:42] <%InternetShis> Yeah
[0:34:43] <T_Sasquatch> Doctor disrespect
[0:34:44] <+tomdwarf> Im hard fiending on it atm, getting through Eden Normal and cosmetics
[0:34:47] <robosqueeb> haha destiny sucks
[0:34:47] <%afronooch> yep
[0:34:47] <draca23> Destiny upsets me so much and I don't even play it
[0:34:48] <+blaze__drag> After Final Fantasy 16 comes out does that mean we're only 2 more FFs away from the series officially becoming an adult?
[0:34:50] <+chiazam> God, Destiny
[0:34:51] <isolex_> did you see the destiny 2 news btw?
[0:34:51] <+nictron90> Do you still play Destiny these days?
[0:34:52] <Treasure_Vault> Even if I don't play Warframe anymore, I know it's still there and fine. Destiny is always newly fucked.
[0:34:55] <+RoByte2> Want to go back and do a 5 year old raid and kill Bahamut? Sure thing!
[0:34:55] <%ThirdWelles> Doc seems a nice fellow
[0:34:55] <%dankjerri> destiny a fuck
[0:34:58] <SaltyAzteca> Destiny is destiny
[0:34:58] <%Monkeyweed21> you need to buy Shadowbringers Deluxe Edition to play the Twinning
[0:35:00] <%Bailey__Gaming> FUCK Bungie super hard
[0:35:02] <$realm_forge> Yeaaah I got nothing for that game anymore
[0:35:04] <%Beough> oh i can bitch about that god forsaken game for hours
[0:35:05] <%barrakuta371> I love Pat complaining about Destiny
[0:35:05] <%InternetShis> "So is Telesto disabled again?"
[0:35:10] <robosqueeb> destiny is toxic shit man
[0:35:10] <nocturnPhoenix> As a once casual Destiny player literally every bit of news about Destiny ensures I will never return
[0:35:13] <MKII> imagine if square made their own destiny. unfortunately probably won't have a YoshiP at the helm
[0:35:14] <%InternetShis> Bungie died after Reach
[0:35:21] <Sp3ctre48> Bro that Destiny news today is insane, how do people still keep up with that game?
[0:35:27] <%RealThiele> its not LUL
[0:35:32] <%dankjerri> lotta complex thuggary
[0:35:35] <T_Sasquatch> Lmfao that's not real
[0:35:36] <%orochiblood> The FGC is full of people trying to be wrestling heels and its so boring.
[0:35:38] <%the38bandit> truuuuuuuu
[0:35:41] <sun312772> Are you goin to play Backbone?
[0:35:42] <%InternetShis> I gave up on Destiny after Shadowkeep
[0:35:43] <@Ranryu692> @internetshis Bungie died after half the team left to work for Microsoft
[0:35:45] <%drabberfaun535> Its crazy how one game can get everything wrong
[0:35:48] <%SharkMissile> I cannot believe this is real life
[0:35:53] <%SharkMissile> I love subcultures so much
[0:35:53] <Treasure_Vault> "The FGC" is kinda like "The South Americans". It's an ocean.
[0:35:55] <%ThirdWelles> that sounds rad
[0:35:57] <+tomdwarf> Somebodys gettin fuckeed
[0:35:59] <%PocketBearIllustrator> sorry, I meant "I know you play fighting games".

[0:36:11] <%Pappajimbo> the thuggery
[0:36:11] <+shumdog> Love that clip
[0:36:13] <+IxDomxI> thats not atlanta.
[0:36:14] <%Monkeyweed21> The FGC is made entirely of Itachis, and views every new player as a Sasuke
[0:36:16] <+WinstonThrasher> fucked, fucked, get fucked
[0:36:22] <+The_Death_Owl> fucked fucked fucked get fucked
[0:36:29] <%InternetShis> @ranryu692 Good ol 343 in Weekend at Halo's

[0:36:37] <%dankjerri> The Bathroom Melty Blooders
[0:36:39] <%Bailey__Gaming> Destiny's telling you to lPay extra for the dungeons then deleting them a few years later is super fun,e
[0:36:44] <chikitsune9> dododo dodododododo
[0:36:46] <%notsoy> tekken and marvel are by far the rowdiest FG scenes and it's not even close
[0:36:49] <%Frost_Quill> Oh yeah Sailor Moon has a fighting game.
[0:36:50] <draca23> The FGC is very welcoming until they feel threatened
[0:36:51] <%dankjerri> or Under Nighters
[0:36:51] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> that's Atlanta Tekken, too.
[0:36:56] <thelonechris> I hate that shit
[0:36:56] <%holydeviant1> I want a mod where when you hit low health the SOMEBODY GETTING FUUUUCKED~ plays

[0:37:05] <+Shady_Zaku> I mean, here in Toronto I just finally started getting into it instead of just watching all these years and the guys here are GREAT! Super inviting and teach me
[0:37:11] <%InternetShis> @ranryu692 Throw those glasses on Master Chief's broken visor, they'll never know how shit his redesign is
[0:37:12] <Saltmeisterr> *COUGH* infiltration *COUGH*
[0:37:13] <%ChestMimik> Smash bros

[0:37:19] <Sp3ctre48> cough cough Infiltration
[0:37:24] <%dankjerri> you mean the children?
[0:37:25] <%orochiblood> You can be as toxic as you want, but if you're good at pushing buttons; you can stay around
[0:37:30] <%InternetShis> Literally everything about Smash needs to die
[0:37:32] <Sp3ctre48> damn beat me to it NotLikeThis
[0:37:33] <%ThirdWelles> This is like that "you gotta care about family" bullshit
[0:37:37] <%SharkMissile> What about competetive DDR? :p
[0:37:40] <+DaRoosta89> 100% better now
[0:37:41] <arizenarkana> Pro Wrestling recently had a whole thing like that.
[0:37:43] <%Monkeyweed21> The FGC's ideal relationship with new players is to ape Itachi choking Sasuke and telling him he's weak and needs hatred
[0:37:45] <SaltyAzteca> THUGGERY
[0:37:50] <%dankjerri> ddr is technically a fighting game
[0:37:52] <Saltmeisterr> @Sp3ctre48 first one that came to mind
[0:37:58] <churropoppa> Like David Jaffe and the game dev community. Minus the being good at what they do.
[0:38:02] <isolex_> T H U G G E R Y
[0:38:04] <%Frost_Quill> If a community isn't at least a little bit toxic it feels super fake.
[0:38:05] <T_Sasquatch> Fighting games and mobas will always be more "toxic"
[0:38:08] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I got a letter that spooked me today, was a court summons. I got selected for jury duty for the first time.
[0:38:10] <OldManDeckardCain> infiltration shit is nothing compared to james chen and the other guys from that arcade covering up Mr wizard's shit

[0:38:31] <%ahomeschooldropout> Destiny 2 is like impossible for someone new or returning to ever get into
[0:38:31] <%bob900000> wtf
[0:38:32] <T_Sasquatch> Oof
[0:38:32] <draca23> I honestly wonder how much Max had an influence on making FGC more welcoming.
[0:38:34] <+chiazam> nooooooooo

[0:40:44] <+tomdwarf> Theres a charm to "thuggery", but it should be more of a kayfabe kind of thing. Only for entertainment. If people are getting hurt physically/emotionally, that shit should stop.

[0:44:24] <%ChestMimik> Montreal is a Yakuza setting for real
[0:44:25] <%InternetShis> Raccoon Hustle Zone
[0:44:28] <+chiazam> WAS THAT BEFORE OR AFTER THE GAME
[0:44:30] <HotMafia81> Raccoon Mafia
[0:44:33] <+Basilias_Maximus> Didn't Capcom have a Canadian division?
[0:44:36] <heybenice> Life…finds a way

[0:45:17] <gslayer14> now time for this roguelike
[0:45:17] <%Agami23> lost in vivo is a pretty good silent hill like
[0:45:18] <%NovaKnightmare> I played Lone Survivor, I love it
[0:45:21] <%InternetShis> Is the park a Stand user? That sounds like Shakedown Road with fewer steps
[0:45:22] <Spagheddies> Lone Survivor.
[0:45:23] <HotMafia81> Yeah but 2d tho
[0:45:24] <%hewlettfan96> Lone survivor??
[0:45:25] <%emMmDeeKay> he said this year
[0:45:26] <%Alazull> Lone Survivor is fantastic
[0:45:26] <Coystick> Play Fear & Hunger you cowards
[0:45:28] <bakkatohri> Lone Survivor is pretty competent. Jasper Byrne is also a pretty good composer.
[0:45:31] <@SSaryn> Konami making eFootball tho Kappa
[0:45:35] <%hewlettfan96> What about outlast
[0:45:36] <lvl10cybermancer> Lone Survivor is super good
[0:45:39] <+Jack8274> What about Dark Wood?
[0:45:46] <%Forbidden_Karp> not to be confused with Loan Survivor the 21st century student simulator
[0:45:54] <OldManDeckardCain> have you seen the video in which austin powers is in mass effect and kicks the star child into the red ending thing LUL

[0:46:16] <%SinnerEbru> BIG agree
[0:46:18] <notandrew101> yes sir
[0:46:19] <bakkatohri> Dark Wood is pretty spooky, but it's hard for people to get into. Most people don't make it to the really good stuff in that game before dropping it.
[0:46:20] <+rrratbastard> hahaha yeah...
[0:46:25] <reonome> i have a mental illness please excuse me :)
[0:46:27] <%chance_h> “Normies out reeee”

[0:46:28] <@SoFarFetched> "excuse me Im a Scorpio, and that means my attitude is shitty"
[0:46:30] <thelonechris> I only killed all those people because I'm wacky lol
[0:46:32] <%akscully> explanation, not an excuse

[0:46:43] <%dekkitout> Cut them lino cute dinosaurs
[0:46:44] <reonome> fake tourettes tiktok is some shit
[0:46:48] <comicalmond> oh this again
[0:46:49] <%PrimalDweeb> The way they should be.
[0:46:51] <@SSaryn> You look at a good amount of True Crime and you get THAT SHIT REAL BAD.
[0:46:54] <%hewlettfan96> Explanation not excuse!!!!!
[0:46:54] <%G_Thunders> diagonal?????
[0:46:55] <+rrratbastard> the things i've seen on tumblr with manipulative people who used self-dx's, woof. wars have been fought

[0:47:00] <%jinking79> god the sandwiches cut again LUL
[0:47:02] <%dankjerri> im literally neurodivergent, can you not interrupt my kill combo?
[0:47:03] <SaltyAzteca> @bakkatohri Absolutely. The cheevo rates on just the tutorial compared to the rest of them is absolutely abysmal
[0:47:03] <+smallboops> GOD fake tourettes tiktoks are a plague
[0:47:04] <ToneBacas> yeah i'm a scorpio so i get to be a bitch to someone (i'm not an advocate for any of this btw)
[0:47:07] <%Frost_Quill> I THINK I might have some OCD tendencies but I'm not gonna use it as an excuse for shitty behavior.
[0:47:07] <ShoMibu> the horror!
[0:47:09] <isolex_> LUL
[0:47:10] <scientiafidem> Anxiety is an actual term outside of the medical condition, saying you are experiencing general anxiety is different then having anxiety disorder.
[0:47:13] <%Broand> But you're neurodivergent and/or a minor!
[0:47:21] <%chance_h> Triangle sandwiches taste better IMO
[0:47:21] <HotMafia81> Diagonal sandwich is scientifically tastier tho.
[0:47:22] <OkamiDude15> @dankjerri thats the one lmao
[0:47:27] <%PrimalDweeb> Yeah, that's a problem.
[0:47:28] <Visorak6> Yeah this is why acknowledging someone's own narcissism then doing nothing about it infuriates me
[0:47:28] <%afronooch> im neurodivergent and minor, excuse me???
[0:47:30] <Sp3ctre48> I remember when we had the teenagers playing genshin Impact defend gambling because of hyperfixactions discourse
[0:47:42] <%NovaKnightmare> I have GAD, it does not excuse the many times I was a dick!
[0:47:43] <%hewlettfan96> Stop shielding
[0:47:44] <%polothegreatest> MercyWing1 psaWhat MercyWing2
[0:47:45] <%dankjerri> a bit
[0:47:45] <%Schrodingers_Box> Full Sandwich only, cutting is for pussies.
[0:47:49] <%Frost_Quill> @chance_h That's legit though, triangle sandwiches literally taste better.
[0:47:51] <@ssjklyco> "Sorry, but I'm a libra, we totes don't compat"
[0:47:55] <+tomdwarf> zapping system?
[0:47:58] <%twistedj3ster> Yeah there were stegosaurous
[0:48:01] <SaltyAzteca> Was it smeckledorf
[0:48:05] <%captainpodock> it gives you a longer leash, it doesn't take your collar off
[0:48:06] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:48:08] <@SoFarFetched> THE SONG SUBHUMAN?
[0:48:11] <%InternetShis> Humans are petty, it's fine
[0:48:17] <%SinnerEbru> ive been having a lot of those moments lately, but what to Do with it is know that thats fucked up and address the issue inside You
[0:48:17] <+Ricky_Rexx> Wtf?
[0:48:19] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah thats totally an overreaction
[0:48:19] <comicalmond> the good old sbf days
[0:48:21] <%orochiblood> Pat is OMEGA?
[0:48:21] <%PrimalDweeb> Bingo!
[0:48:22] <%Monkeyweed21> I have a laundry list of mental and physical health problems, and NONE OF THEM excuse my stupid ass opinions
[0:48:23] <%dankjerri> i sorry
[0:48:25] <isolex_> I remember seeing someone saying "they were going to have a schizophrenia attack"
[0:48:27] <nocturnPhoenix> Cheer500 Hey Pat, on a scale of 1 to 10 how awesome do you think it is that David Jaffe whining about Metroid Dread is blowing up in his face super hard
[0:48:30] <%hewlettfan96> The thing that makes you a freak is that you don’t have dinosaur cut sandwiches
[0:48:35] <T_Sasquatch> Glad to hear someone actually diagnosed say this. I always questioned this new age of things being categorized as a million mental issues
[0:48:39] <SaltyAzteca> Sounds familiar, minecraft familiar....
[0:48:45] <insomniac_doze_> FeelsBadMan
[0:48:46] <@ssjklyco> I remember you apologized in the next podcast.
[0:48:48] <+soraabora> Man did you see that person on twitter blaming their racism on their OCD
[0:48:54] <%Tarage> Eeey it's a Pat.
[0:49:03] <%Frost_Quill> @isolex_ Literally a "I can be your angle or your devil" shitpost but for real?

[0:49:05] <%dankjerri> the tourettes children
[0:49:06] <wibbwobbler> So true
[0:49:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> TikTok is a sewer
[0:49:07] <%Tarage> I like that Pat guy.
[0:49:07] <+bluestbee> Has Pat already talked about the people whining about God of War coming to PC
[0:49:07] <%Forbidden_Karp> Oh I heard of this!
[0:49:08] <%SinnerEbru> ????
[0:49:08] <OkamiDude15> @soraabora WHAT?!

[0:49:15] <%dalmek> oh dear
[0:49:15] <illicitdonut> But what about toks?
[0:49:16] <+Ricky_Rexx> I’ve had an anxiety disorder all my life and as a kid it really got out of control for me sometimes. But I was raised to never use that to justify my shit, always take responsibility
[0:49:17] <%InternetShis> TikTok is the worst
[0:49:18] <Rionxgarland> tik tik toks?
[0:49:18] <+chiazam> What

[0:49:20] <%crimsonharvest> true memetic damage?
[0:49:20] <Spagheddies> Oh, yeah, I saw that article pop up in my TL.
[0:49:21] <%MidnightBurst12> ain't the human mind great
[0:49:23] <EvanAlmighty210> Learned Tourette's?
[0:49:23] <%hewlettfan96> Fuuuuck reaaaly
[0:49:24] <korpocalypse> humans copy each other it's how we are
[0:49:24] <+Bucketman42> That's bizarre
[0:49:24] <%Schrodingers_Box> So TwitteR?
[0:49:25] <LoneFonte> holy fuck
[0:49:27] <%FemmeAndroid> FemmeAndroid subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Back in law school I applied to intern for UltraDavid’s law practice. My cover letter was like ‘I’m a good student specializing in IP law. Plus, here are my FGC videos you retweeted.’  He didn’t have an opening but wrote a nice rejection letter.
[0:49:29] <+chiazam> WHAT
[0:49:29] <%Frost_Quill> Real tics?
[0:49:30] <+inktoxicant> They're watching what tik toks now
[0:49:31] <%SharkMissile> SCP
[0:49:32] <+rrratbastard> that's fucked but also really cool
[0:49:33] <+smallboops> i had psychosomatic tinnitus for a bit when my friend had a breakdown
[0:49:34] <%Anime_Flux> I didn't know that was a thing
[0:49:34] <zanzibarian_hamster> tik tok tick tock ticks?
[0:49:35] <+Ricky_Rexx> The human brain is wonky
[0:49:36] <kiwicoffin> the brain is a strange muscle
[0:49:36] <%Beough> that's fuckin wild
[0:49:36] <%NovaKnightmare> Ah, so like Munchausen syndrome?
[0:49:36] <sendart> human software kinda broken
[0:49:36] <Visorak6> Isnt that some divergence of the placebo effect?
[0:49:37] <thehullowed> Oh shit..
[0:49:38] <lloyddboy> reverse placebo
[0:49:38] <%dekkitout> Dammit that was also a South Park bit
[0:49:38] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I gotta say, having friends who are patient with you, despite being neurodivergent, is an absolute blessing. speak as an autistic person.
[0:49:39] <%Monkeyweed21> my sister has tourettes she is SUPER pissed off about as this trend
[0:49:40] <Paperware> Psychocrusher illness?
[0:49:41] <Spagheddies> Actual memetic hazards.
[0:49:41] <%afronooch> tiktok cause actual psychic damage
[0:49:42] <%ChrisPlaysThing> oh, yay
[0:49:44] <+tomdwarf> Ooh boy, psycosomatic psychological problems!
[0:49:44] <%dankjerri> yep, that jappened to me in elementary for sure
[0:49:44] <Dr_Bearington_The_Second> The brain is strange
[0:49:44] <%TheHateFish> Placebo effect writ large
[0:49:44] <T_Sasquatch> (insert new trendy social media) is the worst
[0:49:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> stupid brain doing brain things
[0:49:45] <SpookyMooks> like a placebo?
[0:49:46] <%captainpodock> south park was right?
[0:49:47] <%hewlettfan96> Holy cuuuck
[0:49:49] <+soraabora> @soraabora Yeah they were like 'I cant help that I'm so afraid of black people' like ????
[0:49:51] <%Deekman> Hysterical pregnancy
[0:49:51] <%Ynkubus_> Behold the power of the brain!
[0:49:52] <SaltyAzteca> You believe it so hard that you actually begin to develop symptoms? @PatStaresAt
[0:49:53] <SaltyDavid> Pat knows when girls are faking it
[0:49:54] <%Dabrikishaw> I KNEW TikTok was cancer
[0:49:55] <%greasypete00> its so cringy watching the "tic" videos where its incredibly obvious theyre faking it
[0:49:55] <zanzibarian_hamster> Nocebo
[0:49:55] <%Schrodingers_Box> tikstok
[0:49:57] <+Jack8274> if their is a real emotional response from others then the brain will change
[0:49:57] <+blurblewurble> yeah there's a balance between using mental health as a shield but also self-diagnosis is important as fuck when mental health care is inaccessible
[0:49:58] <KingKZ> The human brain is amazing and a piece of shit at the same time.
[0:49:59] <%CTMathiu> I'd never heard of psychogenetic illness, that's interesting
[0:50:02] <%Tarage> So wait does Pat inflict his goblins upon us?
[0:50:02] <%G_Thunders> Nocebo
[0:50:02] <+chiazam> How young do you have to be for that to affect you? @patstaresat
[0:50:03] <reonome> the simpsons did it, of course
[0:50:03] <%VictorVonLouche> trained your brain into it
[0:50:07] <+greebotheglorious> Nocebo effect, placebo's goatee twin
[0:50:08] <+Ricky_Rexx> Wait they’re like gaslighting themselves into developing it?
[0:50:09] <%NeoCre> The true Weaponized Memes
[0:50:11] <Meekest> Shes both faking it and crazy
[0:50:11] <$realm_forge> I’m incredibly happy I missed tick tock completely
[0:50:13] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I gotta say, having friends who are patient with you, despite being neurodivergent, is an absolute blessing. speaking as an autistic person.
[0:50:15] <insomniac_doze_> happened to me some months ago because my anxiety was through the roof
[0:50:15] <gslayer14> good ol' nocebos
[0:50:17] <%hewlettfan96> Placebo effect and give them mental illness
[0:50:17] <ShoMibu> yeah I got big dick empathy. just feel sorry for those that don't have a normal one.
[0:50:19] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Yes
[0:50:19] <potatopsychic> oh hey elmo's tail!
[0:50:21] <iswearimjustdandy> That sure is something
[0:50:21] <%ChestMimik> This feels like a Metal Gear plotline psych is so weird
[0:50:22] <+nictron90> There's also  a south park episode where cartman pretends he has tourettes and then actually gets it
[0:50:23] <%bravebravesrobin> Hey Pat, what's worse: people in the U.S. wanting you to speak American or Quebeccans wanting you to only speak French? Cheer500
[0:50:25] <%Bluwizard21> every time he says psychosomatic i think of that damn prodigy song
[0:50:25] <%Schrodingers_Box> There is a South Park Episode where Cartman pretends to have Tourettes to point they get it for real
[0:50:29] <%valriot> Ive had freakouts, and you never feel like "oh i had an excuse", its more "shit im sorry, heres the run down"
[0:50:30] <+Ell1ot> i thought Ralph asked if she was crazy
[0:50:30] <@GeneralSCPatton> Nocebo
[0:50:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah theres a division between actual diagnosed clinical mental disorder and just casuallly using the word for a general emotion
[0:50:42] <kiwicoffin> It's hard to say you're not being crazy by faking being crazy
[0:50:44] <%dankjerri> mhm
[0:50:45] <%MidnightBurst12> blessed by tail
[0:50:46] <%ahomeschooldropout> WebMD is a terrible website
[0:50:46] <spinningchurro> Pat I shat blood twice today but it’s ok because I’m 30 now and that’s what happens.
[0:50:50] <thelonechris> Continuous damage
[0:50:50] <@SSaryn> Stop going on WebMD.
[0:50:52] <ShoMibu> There's why there are professionals.
[0:50:53] <Coystick> I have cronic Ligma
[0:50:55] <%dankjerri> sad
[0:50:56] <%Monkeyweed21> Fibromyalgia is some WILD shit
[0:50:58] <%Fooguwu> or Sudden Adult Death syndrome
[0:51:00] <%hewlettfan96> Nocebo effect can turn you go season
[0:51:01] <%EternalJedi> both are pretty sad rooCry
[0:51:03] <%dekkitout> This is reminding me of the cave allegory again
[0:51:04] <%MidnightBurst12> it's all sad
[0:51:04] <Spagheddies> What about the regular sad?
[0:51:05] <HotMafia81> Errybody SAD
[0:51:11] <+Ell1ot> are a lot of disorders "sad?"
[0:51:11] <%Broand> Inverted cognitive behavioral therapy
[0:51:11] <%ChestMimik> The difference between manic depressive and just depressed can be SUPER IMPORTANT
[0:51:15] <+soraabora> I mean to be fair, reading symptoms of ADHD and then bringing it up to my therapist has helped me a lot and led to an actual diagnosis
[0:51:16] <%solracc25> very Sad
[0:51:16] <%captainpodock> There is that South Park episode where Cartman pretends to have Tourettes and then by then of the episode starts making actual involuntary outbursts
[0:51:17] <%livlinn> Observe your symptoms, don't diagnose
[0:51:17] <%dankjerri> this can happen with STIs as well
[0:51:21] <+smallboops> you can also cure it with a lamp haha
[0:51:22] <+DenpaDev> the answer is not to think
[0:51:22] <evbites> i get depressed and angry in the summer because the heat cooks my brain
[0:51:24] <Yung_FckUp> bad syndrome
[0:51:24] <+Jack8274> Emotional reasoning is a thing
[0:51:25] <%Agami23> why do people get sad in winter? its like the best time of year
[0:51:26] <%bravebravesrobin> WebMD can make you think your sick with anything
[0:51:27] <+slatepunchgroin> self diagnosis leads to cherry picking your problems instead of getting to the root of them
[0:51:30] <%crimsonharvest> and the treatments for the symptoms will absolutely work on you
[0:51:34] <%Aeoneth> Man the human body is so weird
[0:51:34] <potatopsychic> I talk to my deli guy
[0:51:35] <DusK_The_Stray> Basically ignorance is bliss
[0:51:35] <%hewlettfan96> I have chronic flatulence that’s incurable
[0:51:36] <%Frost_Quill> I get pumped in the winter, fuckin love cold weather.  Hot weather pisses me off and I get angry in the summer.
[0:51:36] <%Forbidden_Karp> tulpa  illnesses
[0:51:36] <MartinQ> I'm depressed about living under capitalism WHILE it happens to be dark outside.
[0:51:37] <+greebotheglorious> Seriously. It's bad enough when trained professionals can struggle identifing disorders.
[0:51:37] <%SinnerEbru> 👏👏👏👏
[0:51:37] <zanzibarian_hamster> There's a cruel irony that a generalised anxiety disorder diagnosis often causes an inrease in the said anxiety
[0:51:37] <+RoByte2> Stop reading about diseases, study all the crazy organisms that live on our bodies instead!
[0:51:40] <SaltyAzteca> Pat diagnoses at SeemsGood
[0:51:42] <T_Sasquatch> I heard of it as seasonal depression
[0:51:43] <+JustToWatch> the solution is to never read
[0:51:43] <%Tarage> Pat stop giving me goblins.
[0:51:44] <devanmuse> Understood: NEVER READ
[0:51:46] <+smallboops> also only kind of trust doctors youre not familliar with
[0:51:48] <%NovaKnightmare> Can I talk to the voices about it
[0:51:49] <Dunmarkh> @dankjerri What the fuck do you mean I can modify my cum with my mind?
[0:51:49] <%linSP> Why don’t they have self diagnosed happiness syndrome and then all depression would psychosomatically go away
[0:51:49] <%GarbageNirvana> And remember, if you do drugs, you go to hell before you die
[0:51:50] <%garatrose1> garatrose1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months, currently on a 34 month streak! 
[0:51:51] <Bonebagmel> Thanks pat
[0:51:52] <+Arnschen> Psychosomatic STIs are wild
[0:51:54] <+CapnClassix> But I wouldn't want to Trauma Dump on a therapist, that would be disrespectful... /s
[0:51:54] <%dankjerri> dont read
[0:51:54] <%SharkMissile> Pat you're a good chap :y
[0:51:55] <SpookyMooks> like good old mario told me
[0:51:56] <%TheHateFish> I took my concerns to the NHS. They told me to wait two years for a diagnosis, and I can't afford private.
[0:51:56] <%Broand> I self diagnosed myself as cool once and I was right
[0:51:57] <%Nordguy> self diagnosis is the start, getting an actual diagnosis is the next one
[0:52:00] <%Forbidden_Karp> that's why I'm here, Pat!
[0:52:00] <EibhlinNicCathmhaoil> got dick stuck in computer
[0:52:00] <%bob900000> good advice
[0:52:00] <+slatepunchgroin> it was a good talk
[0:52:03] <HotMafia81> Can priests prescribe me adderall?
[0:52:03] <@ssjklyco> Quick, make a poop joke
[0:52:03] <Coystick> Very astute
[0:52:04] <%VictorVonLouche> be ignorant and talk to experts if it persists
[0:52:05] <zerointelligence000> as someone who panics about every little thing this is some great advice
[0:52:05] <+inktoxicant> psychology degree pat came out
[0:52:06] <%twistedj3ster> I wish you would talk about psych stuff more
[0:52:06] <comicalmond> welcome to pats Ted talk
[0:52:07] <kiwicoffin> Something worth talking about
[0:52:07] <arizenarkana> God the mainstream perception of mental illness is so fucking terrible.
[0:52:07] <%MidnightBurst12> ironic name
[0:52:07] <%hewlettfan96> Understood I’ll never do the drugs Pat!!!
[0:52:09] <+Delenay> i love these educational bits
[0:52:09] <%vVAstrAVv> pats actually being pretty educational lately
[0:52:09] <%muerphy> Therapists are a scam
[0:52:09] <%Agami23> putting that fancy school learnin' to work eh?
[0:52:10] <OkamiDude15> thanks for the ted talk pat
[0:52:11] <gslayer14> don't reflect upon myself and blame the beasts, got it.
[0:52:11] <+Mrbaconator> that was interesting
[0:52:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> big brain pat
[0:52:12] <Thepothero> @patstaresat just got all my healers in Ff14 to 70 goin for all 80 next
[0:52:13] <%mighty_max_t> I had questions about possibly having ADHD, so I went to a professional and get a diagnosis. It really helped to get it out of my own head
[0:52:13] <potatopsychic> @Arnschen lol psychosomatic STIs
[0:52:13] <iswearimjustdandy> I think sometimes you can self diagnose, like if it runs in your family and you experienced symptoms for years
[0:52:14] <+Ricky_Rexx> Father, can you diagnose what’s wrong with me? “Seems like demons to me my child”
[0:52:14] <totallystronk> that was very interesting
[0:52:16] <+greebotheglorious> i just fucking lost it at the name
[0:52:17] <draca23> Almost like you have a degree in this shit
[0:52:17] <Gorgs7> This is why I don't go to the doctor or any of that shit. Them telling you you have high blood pressure and shit can actually create a feedback loop of worrying about that shit
[0:52:19] <%chance_h> Now for the evil twin memes
[0:52:20] <+ArCielArDor> my hooker thinks I have bipolar disorder
[0:52:21] <Madovir> sincere mental health advocate pat is almost as great as crazy pat
[0:52:21] <zanzibarian_hamster> I self diagnose as a hypochondria
[0:52:22] <%dankjerri> @dunmarkh i mean you can make yourself experience the symptoms
[0:52:22] <+itsgundamu> !uptime
[0:52:23] <@Moobot> @itsgundamu I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 52m 32s.
[0:52:23] <isolex_> I always get amazed at how smart pat is, I forget about his psych degree alot
[0:52:23] <+soraabora> LMAO
[0:52:23] <%hewlettfan96> Pat let out a fart to ease the tension
[0:52:25] <OldManDeckardCain> a lot of them tbh
[0:52:25] <arizenarkana> YEAH
[0:52:27] <%NovaKnightmare> Scams are a scam!
[0:52:28] <LoreKeeper_Thal> correct!
[0:52:30] <%greasypete00> especially the ones that have internet degrees
[0:52:30] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:52:30] <%Profmcstevie> everything is a scam, don't do anything
[0:52:32] <EvanAlmighty210> If I self-diagnose myself as having a big dick, will it come true?
[0:52:33] <Visorak6> Some therapists do god's work
[0:52:33] <+soraabora> thinking of that therapist that just told me to 'pray'
[0:52:34] <+Shady_Zaku> vargVibe vargLUL vargLUL vargLUL
[0:52:34] <%crimsonharvest> those therapists that push shit like hypnosis and angels and shit are definitely scams
[0:52:37] <%NovaKnightmare> ATAB
[0:52:38] <totallystronk> how do you find out which ones arent a scam
[0:52:38] <%orochiblood> If people are complaining about Potemkin, they're not ready for Clark in KOF 15.
[0:52:39] <%ChrisPlaysThing> No stop, that gives me goblins about getting help for goblins
[0:52:40] <bakkatohri> Is betterhelp a scam? Because I hear they're a scam.
[0:52:40] <+Arnschen> Yeahhhhh
[0:52:41] <kiwicoffin> Your therapy dog will never scam you
[0:52:41] <+icekept> unfortunately
[0:52:42] <%Deft_Thought> Self-diagnoses have expanded dramatically due to the barriers for access to healthcare in the US. It can be useful to gain some information to explore your issues, but the rabbit hole that can lead one down is potentially destructive.
[0:52:42] <POINTEEEE> some [insert any profession here] are a scam
[0:52:42] <%dankjerri> like the ones without degrees
[0:52:43] <+Ricky_Rexx> Pat have you named your goblins? I think it would help
[0:52:43] <+inktoxicant> better help therapists are DEFINITELY a scam, right?
[0:52:44] <%Nordguy> how do you tell though???
[0:52:44] <evbites> horsethrapey
[0:52:44] <draca23> Gotta find that not-scam therapist
[0:52:44] <+slatepunchgroin> self help books and those who sell them are a scam
[0:52:44] <HotMafia81> That's...better?
[0:52:45] <tanarath> Just like some off everything is.
[0:52:46] <%dankjerri> or BetterHelp
[0:52:47] <OkamiDude15> whats ther percentage of therapists that arent scams
[0:52:49] <%ChestMimik> @evanalmighty210 it already is
[0:52:52] <%dekkitout> Chiropractors are a scam
[0:52:52] <%Frost_Quill> @HotMafia81 They can prescribe the best Adderall, Jesus.
[0:52:53] <%Monkeyweed21> There's also the opposite where I saw a neurologist because I was in constant pain and shaking and he thought it was an early case of Parkinson's then got dissapointed when it wasnt and dismissed me entirely
[0:52:54] <%AgniBrandt> Tell that to the therapist who's probably the only reason I'm not dead.
[0:52:55] <EibhlinNicCathmhaoil> All Counselors Are Bastards
[0:52:56] <%BloodyBurney> if your therapist attributes all of your issues to not taking his expensive vitamins, usually a scam
[0:52:56] <DusK_The_Stray> Gotta get scammed first
[0:52:57] <arizenarkana> NO NOT A LOT OF THEM. THE bAD ONES ARE JUST REALLY LOUD!
[0:52:57] <OldManDeckardCain> remember gert postel LUL
[0:52:58] <SaltyAzteca> There's always gonna be the few therapists. Just like the few doctors, or lawyers, or anyone really, who'll scam you out. There's always one.
[0:53:00] <OneThousandTomatoes> just google it 4Head
[0:53:01] <+Ricky_Rexx> The game is figuring out which ones are which!
[0:53:02] <%TheHateFish> Look for a PhD so you can see their published work.
[0:53:02] <%chance_h> Life is a scam, why aren’t birds real?
[0:53:04] <RandoRations> Who was that one Therapist on Instagram who posted about her clients "TraumaDumping" on their first session
[0:53:05] <%G_Thunders> I pay Twitch streamers for MY therapy :)
[0:53:05] <%twistedj3ster> Ones that don't tell you to hire a prostitute :/
[0:53:06] <%lumporr> yeah you can get a bad one
[0:53:07] <%Saadi90> I love my therapist. She has helped me through some rough periods
[0:53:10] <potatopsychic> you can also schedule a consult session - most are short and free.
[0:53:11] <%twohitgood> ask your therapist who they go to. keep asking until they're not also going to a therapist.
[0:53:12] <+Ell1ot> if they have tic tac toe on thier notepad, they're probably a scam
[0:53:13] <Archmortal> there are some wild therapy techniques that SOUND like a scam that actually work very well
[0:53:13] <%dankjerri> like Mechanics
[0:53:13] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm thankful I can go through the VA for mine
[0:53:14] <%EternalJedi> rule of thumb, find a psychOLOGIST not a psyCHIATRIST
[0:53:15] <+greebotheglorious> How do you tell if a service is reputable LUL
[0:53:15] <Dunmarkh> Ds get degrees
[0:53:16] <%RonaldMcDownload> Even D students graduate Psych school
[0:53:16] <+JonathLP> Or a league of legends silver player
[0:53:17] <%PocketBearIllustrator> if you think therapists are a scam, what's the alternative
[0:53:18] <ryogeo> @PatStaresAt re you ready to use the heart of the horrible evil cards
[0:53:22] <%crimsonharvest> Distinct from say, chiropraxis, which is a scam no matter how good they practitioner is
[0:53:22] <MartinQ> It runs the skill gamut like professionally trained XCOM soldiers.
[0:53:22] <%GarbageNirvana> But yeah you get bad ones sometimes
[0:53:23] <@Jekado> sometimes you have to go through several therapist to find ones you like even
[0:53:23] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt did you see the therapist complaining about her patients trauma-dumping
[0:53:25] <@SoFarFetched> or liek getting a shitty teacher
[0:53:26] <%Redux415> Hi everybody I'm doctor Nick
[0:53:26] <iswearimjustdandy> Pat healthcare is dogshit in the usa sometimes the only option is to self dx, even if thats not the “correct” solution
[0:53:26] <%ahomeschooldropout> Remember that one guy that literally pretended to be a psychologist for years and got away for it because co-workers were afraid of being wrong
[0:53:27] <+inktoxicant> They might just be dumb
[0:53:29] <@SoFarFetched> vs a really GREAT teacher
[0:53:30] <AlcorWinters> Honestly Therapist and Psycologist are a mix bag like anyone, just like Pat said
[0:53:32] <%Agami23> like a doctor seeing you bleeding out and saying "might be because your fat"
[0:53:33] <+glgzephyr> @greebotheglorious reviews, generally
[0:53:33] <%EternalJedi> rule of thumb, find a psychOLOGIST not a psyCHIATRIST ruuYell
[0:53:35] <Visorak6> Anytime pat!
[0:53:35] <@SSaryn> It also doesn't help that some of those skills are apparently taught by some people who are literally in mountains and not in actual medical records.
[0:53:37] <%dankjerri> 50 kromer
[0:53:39] <MaybeFalco> just make sure to especially avoid the sketchy back alley therapists
[0:53:39] <Archmortal> The basic rule of thumb is if the therapist doesn't listen to you, get the fuck out and find a new one
[0:53:40] <raikagelord1> Exactly
[0:53:41] <%lumporr> oh fuck's saek
[0:53:41] <%captainpodock> Just remember if you say to yourself "I think I'm being scammed" you're usually being scammed.
[0:53:43] <%polothegreatest> random success rate
[0:53:44] <+The_Death_Owl> Bad therapists need to spend more time in the lab learning empathy combos
[0:53:45] <WaxWitch> I saw that today, like the fuck
[0:53:48] <tanarath> well intentioned, poorly trained, etc.
[0:53:55] <s1eepyshiba> no dont
[0:53:57] <%VictorVonLouche> tbh understanding humans is hard
[0:54:06] <s1eepyshiba> no salt needed here dude she's garbo
[0:54:07] <+toastybites> was it cuz of burnout
[0:54:08] <+OhioNitsud> call your insurance company you get from work. you might be covered for therapy
[0:54:11] <%lumporr> oh no
[0:54:11] <SaltyAzteca> YER BUYING TINY CONDOMS??
[0:54:13] <%greasypete00> they absolutely do
[0:54:14] <%ChrisPlaysThing> We judge
[0:54:15] <%G_Thunders> Oh come on, all therapists get fed up at one point
[0:54:15] <%dankjerri> they do look
[0:54:15] <%dekkitout> People with judge
[0:54:18] <+Vampireinarm> I always looked and always judged lol
[0:54:18] <bimblewort> that's SUCH a lie
[0:54:18] <%Dova573> True
[0:54:19] <%Tarage> STOP LOOKING AT MY JUNK PAT
[0:54:19] <Blackleafx> D:

[0:54:33] <Tomschiii> not really. i see their stuff but i dont fcking care
[0:54:33] <@SSaryn> And if they look, they forget it 5 seconds later.
[0:54:33] <@Ranryu692> George Carlin had a great joke: "Somewhere out there is the worst doctor in the world, and someone has an appointment to see him tomorrow"
[0:54:34] <%NovaKnightmare> MY PARANOIA IS RIGHT
[0:54:34] <@ssjklyco> And tech support
[0:54:35] <%Profmcstevie> You can buy ANYTHING and we will mock
[0:54:37] <%Frost_Quill> I WILL judge you for buying condoms and cucumbers, it's going to happen.
[0:54:39] <%28moogles> If I couldn't talk shit about customers I would go insane at my job.
[0:54:39] <%Tarage> PAT NO
[0:54:39] <ToneBacas> what's a fun combo of items to buy to make a clerk lose their shit laughing the moment you turn heel?
[0:54:39] <wasdknife> pat yes

[0:54:43] <Coystick> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CURSED KNOWLEDGE NOOO NONONONONO
[0:54:43] <%slimmixrp> Nurses too
[0:54:44] <%WeLucklessJacks> I was a cashier, we didn't give a shit.
[0:54:45] <%Ne1son> Welcome to IT I talk shit about lawyers and judges all day
[0:54:46] <@SoFarFetched> "wait you're telling me he held his poop on for THAT long because he was outside???"
[0:54:48] <DusK_The_Stray> I work in a fast food and I make fun of anyone who takes out the vegetables in their food
[0:54:49] <Spagheddies> If it's big, they're compensating. If it's small, par for the course.
[0:54:49] <chaosbringer28> and here comes the anxiety
[0:54:49] <Scantron_The_Immortal> Just because someone is trying to help you doesn't mean they have a private opinion on it or you.
[0:54:50] <%SharkMissile> @PatStaresAt PRESERVE THE MASQUERADE, PATRON
[0:54:51] <$Futurecity10> Doctors have a massive sense of black humor
[0:54:51] <wasdknife> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSS
[0:54:51] <%Agami23> yeah but if its on social media?
[0:54:51] <%Dova573> I have Friend who works in medical thats true
[0:54:52] <Zeif00> "the smelly one is back"
[0:54:53] <%justcallmebobplease> Because people are people, not because therapists are shitty.
[0:54:54] <EibhlinNicCathmhaoil> As someone who works tech support currently we DO shit talk you
[0:54:54] <%luckyturtelle> She worked with children
[0:54:55] <%Tarage> PAAAAAAAAAT NOOOOOOOOOOOO

[0:54:56] <%ThirdWelles> the only difference is that it's illegal in medicine, right?
[0:54:56] <%akscully> when I was as sub teacher, the teachers talked so much shit about students and parents in the lounge lol
[0:54:57] <gslayer14> as long as i don't see it who cares
[0:54:58] <%ChestMimik> HIPPA is only so powerful
[0:54:58] <bimblewort> even at fucking GAMESTOP I was judging people. You just don't be the person to go public with this shit
[0:55:00] <+Rylention> and what they tell their spouse etc
[0:55:02] <+Extrallent> that really helps my social anxiety Pat
[0:55:02] <+The_Death_Owl> You're giving us all mind goblins Pat!
[0:55:02] <MoonKing> You WILL be judged for buying a soda and a candy bar at the same time
[0:55:03] <+psidefx> NEW FEAR THANKS

[0:55:03] <%solracc25> Oh yes, Doctors will talk shit but no names
[0:55:05] <SaltyDavid> Pat this is actually dangerous knowledge you are imparting
[0:55:05] <%dekkitout> The things I've talked about with my epidemiologist at work- GODDAMN
[0:55:06] <EvanAlmighty210> When I was a cashier I saw a really old guy by KY lube. You bet your ass I talked shit about it

[0:55:33] <Zeif00> "Let me just destroy my career"
[0:55:33] <+tomdwarf> On the positive side, because its so common, that shit is legit forgotten in 3 days.
[0:55:34] <totallystronk> Every profession is like that

[0:55:55] <%hewlettfan96> Cheer500 Pat what do you think of people however that are genuinely have anxiety disorders and ass burgers syndrome, yet equally use it as an excuse to do shitty things, Is it right? I’ve been the recipient of bullying by people who thought the had the right because they suffered the most? How can we stop them??
[0:55:55] <%mighty_max_t> Treating finding a therapist like you're giving them a job interview really helped me find one I clicked with

[1:02:24] <%muerphy> vigilante 8 is better
[1:02:24] <%TheHateFish> Personal rejection letters make a lot of difference
[1:02:24] <%RealThiele> this is why its important to remember that video games are more than just one person, unless they are

[1:02:29] <Calek> @PatStaresAt I'm proud of you
[1:02:31] <+tomdwarf> I prefer a custom rejection, over a generic "Thanks for sending it, we'll talk later!" and you hear nothing.
[1:02:33] <%Profmcstevie> The stabby run sounded hilarious, just solving problems

[1:03:30] <%SharkMissile> @PatStaresAt Do you think the dancing madness was psychogenic?
[1:03:37] <draca23> Is this, to an extent, mass hysteria?
[1:03:39] <%EternalJedi> THEY GOT STUCK THAT WAY ruuD
[1:03:41] <+tomdwarf> But they convinced themselves they have it hard.
[1:03:41] <Spagheddies> Speaking of Little Hope: the next part of that anthology is coming out soon, chat.

[1:04:06] <%Kirby_Sauce> big ork sickness
[1:04:07] <+LucentHolic> oh it's a memetic SCP
[1:04:07] <evbites> it's like gaslighting disease
[1:04:08] <dds333a> quite common
[1:04:08] <%Profmcstevie> The mind makes the body exhibit
[1:04:10] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt But in the Salem Witch Trials everyone was fucking HIGH on damp-ass hallucinogenic mold from a wet year in their grain stores!!!  I thought I looked that up anyway-- so not psychosomatic just PSYCHEDELIC
[1:04:11] <%PartyFavors> Oh sick, we haven’t started yet
[1:04:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's the body taking after the mind.
[1:04:14] <+glgzephyr> it is literally orks
[1:04:15] <Darthkitten_Prime> basically placebo
[1:04:16] <%Frost_Quill> Placebo is basically magic.

[1:04:32] <+Shaggnar> @Calek Yes actually, but no one can call it that anymore LUL
[1:04:34] <+JonathLP> The beans thing is from the Trippy Hippie

[1:04:53] <DomunDomunDomun> A BEAN!
[1:04:55] <KingKZ> The power of suggestion
[1:04:57] <+JonathLP> Trippy Hippie is the source of the "beans" thing. She's British. She has Tourette's.

[1:05:40] <%Monkeyweed21> dancing plague was the real comparison, Salem Witch Trials was just an outbreak of LSD producing mold in the grain lead to the persecution of random women,usually the mentally ill or neurodivergent
[1:05:40] <%Frost_Quill> Placebos are magic basically.
[1:05:40] <+tempestzephyr> the mind is crazy

[1:05:45] <%baka_sugoi> PatstaresatTherapy
[1:05:46] <%darklordfodder> We don't have hard evidence that this is happening at a statistically significant level.
[1:05:46] <%RealThiele> DNA OF THE SOUL
[1:05:46] <OneThousandTomatoes> brain is dumb
[1:05:47] <@SSaryn> Medical/Science bullshit is weird

[1:06:03] <%baka_sugoi> csbeastSetIn NotLikeThis csbeastSetIn WutFace
[1:06:03] <SaltyAzteca> A cult maybe, could have that effect?
[1:06:04] <+JonathLP> @PatStaresAt Trippy Hippie is the source of the "beans" thing. She's British. She has Tourette's. She says "beans" as a tic.
[1:06:04] <Ombrebird> peach is gonna give us lupus guys

[1:06:08] <+RemedyofRevenge> @PatStaresAt I'm actually experiencing that, but instead with my anxiety. I used to get nauseous when I was anxious, but after a health scare, I get abdominal pains
[1:06:09] <%Monkeyweed21> This is literally a MEMETIC DISEASE
[1:06:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that's just a cult of personality
[1:06:13] <+handsomerakshas> Watching Pat makes me scratch my balls more
[1:06:14] <%hewlettfan96> Placebo is basically insane
[1:06:15] <+psidefx> @lvl10cybermancer Perfection
[1:06:17] <%Anime_Flux> I enjoy Pat's psychology podcasts, these are super informative
[1:06:22] <gslayer14> you'd need a cabal
[1:06:25] <%darklordfodder> This is the worst example of armchair sociology, I say as somebody who is not a sociologist.
[1:06:27] <ElusiveBaikenPlayer> is anorexia similar to this?
[1:06:30] <%hewlettfan96> It is MEMETIC Disease
[1:06:31] <%JoshManVGH> I did not know that about Lady Gaga
[1:06:32] <%Nordguy> Can I get psychogenic Big Penis syndrome
[1:06:32] <jorniev> VIRUS SPREADING TROUGH THE MEMES
[1:06:34] <%Rafferty3231> fuck this planet, I don't wanna live here anymore
[1:06:36] <ShoMibu> I don't find tictock videos funny. Do I have a problem?
[1:06:36] <+OhioNitsud> Pat has influenced me to slap my tum-tum
[1:06:37] <+Shaggnar> @karl_rex Okay so apparently it's just when you get that little shiver when you piss sometimes which is totally normal
[1:06:37] <lloyddboy> I have an illness where I believe rats can't swim :(
[1:06:39] <commanderapathy> so basically hypochondriacs?
[1:06:40] <totallystronk> yea this facts
[1:06:40] <Blackleafx> the memes jack
[1:06:42] <%ShogunNoonto> I think I did this to myself My cat would wake me up in the night night her a bitch  And now every time I wake up And stretch I say bitch
[1:06:42] <dds333a> Maybe some people will think that's what it is
[1:06:42] <ChanceofLoot> did we alrdy stop inscryption
[1:06:46] <%Profmcstevie> The beans jack, memes of the soul
[1:06:46] <Ombrebird> give us memetic peaach lupus
[1:06:47] <%solracc25> So like self hypnosis unconsciously?
[1:06:48] <%justcallmebobplease> THAT'S THE POINT PAIGE
[1:06:50] <%Ipsenscastle> didn't victorian ladies used to limp when Queen Victoria developed a limp?
[1:06:52] <%KetsuoTaberu> Cheer500 I really love these pre-stream segments and the variety of topics. And damn Pat you've really got your words together sometimes.
[1:06:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> that's the issue
[1:06:54] <@PeachSaliva> @chanceofloot haven’t started just yet
[1:06:54] <%Monkeyweed21> its actually memetic diseases

[1:06:56] <totallystronk> !uptime
[1:06:56] <@Moobot> @totallystronk I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 7m.
[1:06:57] <Madovir> @solracc25 yes
[1:06:59] <%lumporr> @Nordguy oh no, you have a big penis! there's nothing you can do! oh no!
[1:07:10] <%ospreyworks> Do you think that can lead to people doing research and realizing that that's what they had all along?
[1:07:11] <%JoshManVGH> Man that makes those Memetic threats in SCP documents even more terrifying.
[1:07:11] <%Broand> @solracc25 it's vaguely similar
[1:07:12] <%hewlettfan96> Lupus
[1:07:13] <Ombrebird> the memes jack
[1:07:13] <%chance_h> Tik tok also curates your feed, building a community of victims
[1:07:15] <%TheHateFish> I mean, I know this is actual memetic behaviour spreading through a mostly-unstudied network of social interraction, but still. Not only is this THE MEMES JACK, these are almost literally WORDS THAT KILL. Especially with that thing where English-speakers are more likely to get COVID-19
[1:07:15] <%Profmcstevie> Pat sure does talk good when he has energy and enthusiasm
[1:07:17] <dds333a> @ketsuotaberu comes from speaking LUL
[1:07:17] <%dankjerri> like i have bad eczema and blisters some days but i know better than having lupus

[1:07:32] <%WhereIsWill> isnt this like that ghost pregnancy thing?
[1:07:32] <%Frost_Quill> Everything on WebMD leads to cancer, basically like that.
[1:07:35] <%dankjerri> VICTIMS ARE PROFITABLE FOR SOCIAL MEDIA
[1:07:36] <%justcallmebobplease> Accidentally controlling your own body.
[1:07:38] <KingKZ> Phantom Lupus
[1:07:40] <%KineticZen> I hate how it's misspelled "cognito"hazard when it should be cogito

[1:08:22] <%hewlettfan96> LUL
[1:08:22] <shyrstyne> i have to wonder how much is psychosomatic and how much is 'wait i have exactly those experiances is that what that is?' and finally get help with something they've been unknowingly struggling with their whole lives
[1:08:23] <%CopperTucker> just look at tumblr users who claim to have DID
[1:08:25] <%Ynkubus_> A bunch of them are madness voyuers which doesnt help
[1:08:26] <soundcloud_raptor> hey pat, look up where the word sophomore comes from
[1:08:26] <IvanMistwalker> So it's best to have high moral when you get sick.
[1:08:27] <%MugenSandan> What happens in 3rd year then?
[1:08:27] <yficaptions> like being able to partially read the elder scroll

[1:08:30] <tolloponik> man, the human mind is a completely broken and complicated thing
[1:08:31] <MildMannered_Creighton> aww

[1:08:35] <+Arnschen> Awww
[1:08:35] <gslayer14> wait if you can induce negative effects via societal pressure does that mean that crystals actually work?
[1:08:37] <+Shady_Zaku> aaaaawwwe <3 <3
[1:08:39] <%darklordfodder> I'm not convinced this is really a problem, though. How many people are actually having this happen? 1000? 100? 10?
[1:08:39] <%hewlettfan96> He’s Smort
[1:08:40] <zerointelligence000> you're smart but crazy

[1:08:49] <%NovaKnightmare> that sounded like that one Vine guy, Paige
[1:08:50] <%ChrisPlaysThing> People get mad and yell at you for being always right
[1:08:50] <+tomdwarf> Pat is smart, with the things he knows. Its just he can be SUPER dumb on other stuff.
[1:08:50] <%TheHateFish> @dds333a Plus, there's that dude who attacked a special forces team with a katana and blocked goddamned bullets. We're actually in the Metal Gear timeline.
[1:08:52] <RayCSmooth> Smrt

[1:09:00] <%karovus> hearing pat talk about topics hes knowledgeable about is weird but very enjoyable
[1:09:00] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Is this just Dr. Conrad Verner again
[1:09:02] <%hewlettfan96> smart Brain Pat
[1:09:03] <%RealThiele> if you believe they work at 110%
[1:09:06] <%MidnightBurst12> oh shit
[1:09:07] <%Frost_Quill> Placebos are wild and they feel like genuine magic sometimes.
[1:09:07] <@SoFarFetched> You Mean the JO Crystals? geefThink
[1:09:08] <T_Sasquatch> Hmmmm
[1:09:09] <evbites> cool
[1:09:10] <%pokefan9956> !uptime
[1:09:10] <@Moobot> @pokefan9956 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 9m.
[1:09:13] <dds333a> Completely disproven too
[1:09:13] <%ThirdWelles> Placebo works. It's all placebo.
[1:09:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> it's placebo so it did work
[1:09:18] <%hewlettfan96> Ahh shit
[1:09:19] <%ChestMimik> I think Mythbusters said they didn't cover a lot of myths for the same reason
[1:09:22] <+Jack8274> My sister went to Acupuncture College. Seriously
[1:09:22] <%GarbageNirvana> Chiropractors are next
[1:09:23] <%polothegreatest> damn
[1:09:24] <@SSaryn> It's why GOOP is so fucking successful and it's REAL FUCKED UP
[1:09:24] <%CTMathiu> wow!
[1:09:25] <All_Salt> I thought you were talking about FF crystals for a second
[1:09:27] <evbites> put the stones in your vagoo
[1:09:27] <%chance_h> They work as well as a placebo can work
[1:09:27] <NeroInfinite> ah yes the JO crystal.
[1:09:28] <oda_flobunaga> The crystals are just as effective as any placebo.  For any person who believes they will work, they will work
[1:09:29] <AMajorTom> Placebo is great at pain relief.
[1:09:30] <bimblewort> that's crazy, how interesting
[1:09:31] <%MidnightBurst12> placebo is too powerful
[1:09:32] <iosephe> It was a super placebo
[1:09:33] <@ssjklyco> The human mind is amazing
[1:09:34] <%Profmcstevie> Successful fakes
[1:09:34] <insomniac_doze_> your own mind is a hell of a drug
[1:09:34] <Visorak6> Did they finally disprove chiropractioners?
[1:09:35] <+RemedyofRevenge> @PatStaresAt just tried Celeste for the first time, totally see why it would summon Mind Goblins in attack position
[1:09:36] <%Fooguwu> It's actually really difficult to beat placebo when making a new medicine
[1:09:36] <+Jack8274> Magnet braclets
[1:09:37] <%purplestufff> fuckin chiropractors
[1:09:38] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Placebo is so strong, that even if you know it's placebo, it can still feel real.
[1:09:39] <%KineticZen> Crazy what people can convince themselves of
[1:09:40] <@Ranryu692> remember your discussion with Woolie about "rolfing"
[1:09:40] <upitty4> placebo is the best placebo
[1:09:40] <%ChrisPlaysThing> 33% is a good number
[1:09:40] <%RealThiele> Spiral power shit
[1:09:41] <%crimsonharvest> dont forget people, placebo can only address symptoms
[1:09:41] <Archmortal> Acupuncture STILL "works" even having been disproven
[1:09:41] <%DSD24> Wait acupuncture was BS?
[1:09:42] <EibhlinNicCathmhaoil> fake it til you make it
[1:09:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what about chiro
[1:09:44] <%PrimalDweeb> Cool
[1:09:45] <%Teyaric> So, wait. This is horrible but - Is this what the TERFS are on about when they spout "social contaigon" shit??????
[1:09:45] <cthulu_fearlock> take a bath in da GOOP smh
[1:09:45] <IvanMistwalker> Task Failed Successfully
[1:09:46] <@Jekado> "WHERE CAN I GET THIS WONDERS DRUG CALLED PLACEBO?!?"
[1:09:46] <OkamiDude15> the human mind is fuckin weird man
[1:09:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Brain is so powerful.
[1:09:47] <BonsLaBons> believe it works
[1:09:48] <+handsomerakshas> Pure Morning
[1:09:50] <%blastyoboots> that's a hilarious sentence to wrap one's head around: "IT WAS SO FAKE THAT IT WORKED"
[1:09:51] <oda_flobunaga> Psychosomatic healing is a REAL thing
[1:09:51] <zanzibarian_hamster> Thats why I'm gonna live forever, because I believe I will
[1:09:53] <%Ipsenscastle> this is why dumb people are statistically healthier than cynical people
[1:09:54] <+Shaggnar> Placebo effect is just that strong. The problem is when you think it will cure your serious disease and not something like minor pain which placebo is fine for
[1:09:56] <HotMafia81> Lol, I work in worker's comp, and accupuncture still gets approved/recommended for people's chronic pain
[1:09:57] <%polothegreatest> chinese medice doesnt work NotLikeThis
[1:09:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> pat is making you less healthy by telling you that its fake
[1:09:58] <%greasypete00> cupping?
[1:09:58] <Darthkitten_Prime> I assume the problem is that it can't cure or stop the really serious things
[1:09:58] <yficaptions> hypnotism works for the same reason
[1:09:59] <ohno778> YOU GOTTA BELIEVE
[1:09:59] <%Frost_Quill> And placebo WORKS which is WILD and is basically brain magic.
[1:09:59] <%ThirdWelles> In short, The brain controls the human body A TON, and if you can trick your brain, it'll control it adversely
[1:10:00] <%Deft_Thought> Purely psychosomatic!
[1:10:01] <Treasure_Vault> Do massages do anything but feel nice?
[1:10:02] <%Sotetsu> Placebos rock.
[1:10:02] <%MidnightBurst12> zambos
[1:10:03] <KingKZ> You know all this and play videogames for a living. Life is wild.
[1:10:03] <%BoxNavy> not at all :)
[1:10:04] <%pokefan9956> reminds me of hypnosis
[1:10:05] <NeroInfinite> very
[1:10:05] <IvanMistwalker> VoHiYo
[1:10:06] <Visorak6> Which ones?
[1:10:06] <%ChrisPlaysThing> The haiti kind?
[1:10:07] <T_Sasquatch> This is exactly what I mean by just stop being crazy 4Head . The human mind is great
[1:10:07] <%HaroldDonchee> sucks because psychosomatic stuff works the opposite direction too but most people are negative
[1:10:07] <DusK_The_Stray> Voodoo Zombies?
[1:10:08] <BonsLaBons> believe like the orks from warhammer
[1:10:08] <BigFingerRo> BUT YOU GOTTA BELIEVE HARD ENOUGH
[1:10:08] <Treasure_Vault> 100%
[1:10:09] <%crimsonharvest> you mean actual vudun shit
[1:10:09] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Eyyy
[1:10:09] <%twistedj3ster> I'm now very uncomfortable with my mind...

[1:10:12] <ToneBacas> i heard about that
[1:10:12] <%hewlettfan96> You gotta believe
[1:10:13] <commanderapathy> yo
[1:10:13] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt placebos can work even if you dont personally believe it
[1:10:13] <Darthkitten_Prime> Somewhat
[1:10:14] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I think I know where Pat is going with this.
[1:10:14] <DusK_The_Stray> Ah yeah
[1:10:14] <%MacMog> but if I can have fake needles poke me and improve my condition, when used with real medicine, I’ll do it
[1:10:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> That shit.
[1:10:14] <+takotoots> like White Zombie?
[1:10:15] <%Frost_Quill> Little soul thing.
[1:10:15] <iosephe> oh, not Philosophical Zombies
[1:10:15] <%EternalJedi> acupuncture is BS, chiropractors are real, you just gotta have a legit one

[1:10:18] <+Grave_Titan_D> voodoo
[1:10:18] <@Ranryu692> passing familiarity
[1:10:19] <draca23> I still say it worked because the 'pinch' gets your mind off the pain
[1:10:19] <@SSaryn> A lot of it is nuts
[1:10:19] <Dunmarkh> Yeah my dad was talking about them yesterday
[1:10:19] <$spleekle> but that gamer skin creame will heal my blue light cancer
[1:10:19] <%RealThiele> stitch their lips closed ez

[1:10:33] <oda_flobunaga> Yuri Geller
[1:10:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Rob Zombie?
[1:10:34] <%dankjerri> acupuncture has so much pomp and circumstance to its performance thats its hard not to get sucked in. like fuckin Mediums and cold reading and shit.
[1:10:35] <%chance_h> Rob Zombie is pretty dope, I love his recent album
[1:10:36] <%CzeekyTV> Does that explain hypnosis as well?
[1:10:36] <%solracc25> no
[1:10:38] <%EternalJedi> it's more of a hypnosis/suggestion thing
[1:10:40] <dds333a> exactly
[1:10:41] <Gorgs7> Basically psychosymptimatic slavery
[1:10:43] <+ThomasOfTroy> So basically the deal with hypnosis?
[1:10:44] <Louie_Salmon> Human beings are Warhammer goblins with medicine.
[1:10:44] <%hewlettfan96> Voodoo poo
[1:10:48] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> My ignorance of voodoo, will protect me from voodoo
[1:10:48] <%Sotetsu> Clap your hands for Tinkerbell
[1:10:54] <Edible_Enthusiasm> hello yes, religion?
[1:10:54] <%Frost_Quill> Placebos are brain magic.
[1:10:55] <+handsomerakshas> Everybodies Fuckin in A UFO
[1:10:55] <karl_rex> Human brain off the shits
[1:10:55] <+BIumen> like in the book I Am Legend with vampires being based on faith
[1:10:56] <%Broand> This is also how exorcisms work, it provides a narrative where the "demon is slain"
[1:10:56] <%RealThiele> your brain just kills you
[1:10:57] <+tomdwarf> I mean, if its subconscious, is that bad? Like you accept its not real, but you deep down want it to be?
[1:10:57] <%lumporr> i mean placebo seems like magic
[1:11:00] <%bevyrage> yes
[1:11:00] <%darklordfodder> Same thing
[1:11:01] <commanderapathy> If you believe it, it'll work
[1:11:01] <%dekkitout> And that's why cosmic horror is rad
[1:11:02] <%Anime_Flux> yuuuup
[1:11:03] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @chance_h Sleezy Rider is pretty cool.
[1:11:05] <%lumporr> placebo is magic
[1:11:05] <@SSaryn> ***Magic***
[1:11:05] <+UltraViolet371> Is that what the australian witch did to paige?
[1:11:06] <+Jack8274> Def the same thing
[1:11:06] <totallystronk> 100% true
[1:11:07] <+Arnschen> Yep
[1:11:09] <%sakeydo> Maybe its a good thing I dodge a pysch degree.
[1:11:09] <%DSD24> Pat is casting hexes
[1:11:10] <+RJay80> Who do you voodoo bitch? Stand Up
[1:11:11] <%Ipsenscastle> glossolalia
[1:11:11] <%GarbageNirvana> Can confirm, mom used to do it
[1:11:11] <oda_flobunaga> the Farting Preacher was real
[1:11:13] <%dankjerri> mediums and psychics
[1:11:13] <dds333a> There's a similar effect with african fetishes
[1:11:14] <zanzibarian_hamster> Start talking about morphogenetic field theory next
[1:11:15] <%ChrisPlaysThing> They also feed them the Zombie seacucumber and it causes grey skin and slowed heart rate
[1:11:18] <%polothegreatest> drugs are magick
[1:11:18] <+pectusumbra> there is probably drugs involved in zombie stuff as well, to be noted
[1:11:18] <NeroInfinite> ork magic
[1:11:18] <%hewlettfan96> If you believe it it’s work
[1:11:21] <WaxWitch> getting the holy spirit
[1:11:22] <%Pappajimbo> homopathy was great back in the day as it was less worse than bleeding the person
[1:11:23] <%crimsonharvest> that religious hysteria is absolutely the same kind of mass bullshit as the witch trial stuff
[1:11:24] <Zeif00> Oh man that clip from Jesus Camp  with the tongue bit

[1:11:31] <%RealThiele> A-word
[1:11:31] <captain_kirkhammer> Speaking in tongues is also explicitly called demonic in the Bible, no idea why those people think it itsn't
[1:11:33] <DusK_The_Stray> Oh my Gawd, Paige
[1:11:34] <IvanMistwalker> D:
[1:11:34] <+tempestzephyr> slap the demon out of dis bitch!
[1:11:34] <%EternalJedi> speaking in tongues is supposed to be being able to speak and understand all languages, NOT BABBLE GIBBERISH AND HAVE A SEIZURE
[1:11:35] <%Deekman> My church was like that as a kid. It was fucking stupid
[1:11:35] <+Arnschen> D:
[1:11:37] <%MugenSandan> Paige can't be a paladin anymore
[1:11:38] <%MacMog> zombie powder was a hallucinogen (?) that, combined with telling the victims “I rule you”, it worked
[1:11:38] <%Frost_Quill> it's either self-hypnosis or big fakers, it's hard to tell which.
[1:11:39] <%bravebravesrobin> this is a fascinating dialogue by the way

[1:11:43] <%TDotGoat> christian stream canceled
[1:11:44] <%hewlettfan96> LMMMAAAO
[1:11:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt placebos can work even if you dont necessarily believe in them
[1:11:45] <isolex_> evangelical Christian churches are WILD
[1:11:45] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> you mean this isn't a christian stream?!
[1:11:46] <+tomdwarf> He sounds like a Sifu....
[1:11:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OH MY GOOOOOOOD
[1:11:46] <@GeneralSCPatton> I wonder how strong of a thought-activated placebo effect you could train yourself to have by just believing that you can hijack the placebo effect.
[1:11:49] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> WaitHowDidIGetHere subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 2 month streak!

[1:11:55] <HotMafia81> Listen, the atheism is one thing, but the fact that she admitted it IN ENGLISH is what gets me
[1:11:55] <+Ell1ot> i like watching those videos of magic fighter dudes getting their asses kicked by actual fighter dudes
[1:11:58] <+handsomerakshas> Warm sake very goo
[1:11:58] <%Anime_Flux> I was raised in one of those churches
[1:11:58] <%RealThiele> did paige get placebo'ed
[1:12:03] <@SoFarFetched> @LegitBarnacleBoy yeah seems to be on twitch's end
[1:12:04] <%s_xylocalsingles> s_xylocalsingles subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 53 months, currently on a 53 month streak! On this topic you've discussed it before on the Podcast that if someone prays for you while you're in the hospital, you have a higher chance of dying because your body placebos itself to be ready for death
[1:12:06] <luftraumm1> one of the craziest things is how easy it is to enter a trance,  you can easily cause yourself to have hallucinations by staring into a mirror
[1:12:08] <staye100> Yeah Evangelical churces are something else
[1:12:09] <commanderapathy> used to go to church all the time when I was a kid, never have I ever spoke in tounges

[1:12:24] <%polothegreatest> WutFace
[1:12:24] <BigFingerRo> Speaking in tongues is fucked because people in those churches will tell you it's a gift of god, and it's a particularly rare one, so they want you to keep doing it
[1:12:25] <+dazdndcunfusd> oh god she joined a cult
[1:12:25] <ohno778> NICE

[1:12:42] <%bravebravesrobin> what about all the stories of snake preachers getting bit by the snakes?
[1:12:45] <ohno778> The holy ghost manifests in many ways lol
[1:12:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> the first few people are probably in on it
[1:12:49] <%Sotetsu> Maybe he rubbed his feet on the carpet a bunch before he touched you.
[1:12:49] <%chance_h> The Holy Spirit came
[1:12:50] <Explodincatz> Paige didnt want to ruin the bit
[1:12:53] <LoreKeeper_Thal> YES, THAT
[1:12:54] <%hewlettfan96> GINGER WOMAN FUGHTS CHRIST
[1:12:54] <%Frost_Quill> "Devil woman laughs hysterically after church man tried to banish her lupus demons."
[1:12:54] <%RealThiele> your brain can be fooled easy
[1:12:57] <%DSD24> Its why peer pressure is awful
[1:12:58] <Polyceramic> crazyyy
[1:12:58] <Yung_FckUp> damn everyone got goblins
[1:12:58] <%IronOhki> HERD MENTALITY
[1:12:59] <%Profmcstevie> Monkee brain
[1:13:01] <%dankjerri> you just need the subconciouss bias somewhere in the room
[1:13:02] <@ssjklyco> This reminds  me of those spirit shows where they cold read the audience and the audience is giving him the answers unkowingly and think he is actually talking to their dead relatives.
[1:13:02] <%Pappajimbo> jeebus orgasim

[1:13:03] <+pectusumbra> literally Mass Hysteria
[1:13:03] <%lumporr> this is all very scary to me
[1:13:04] <BigFingerRo> the brain sure is fuckin weird
[1:13:04] <%GarbageNirvana> Now we're getting Jungian
[1:13:06] <arizenarkana> Why magicians look for the skeptics first.
[1:13:06] <ilthyf> WHAT
[1:13:07] <+dazdndcunfusd> thats why megachurches work so well
[1:13:07] <ToneBacas> so if enough people fake it, it might work if you're in a group
[1:13:09] <%linSP> By the way, DONT tell people you’re praying for them if they’re sick
[1:13:09] <%SharkMissile> "I didn't want to ruin the bit" - religion, for 12,000 years
[1:13:09] <dds333a> can go crazy
[1:13:09] <%sakeydo> But sometimes its more fun in life to be believer.
[1:13:10] <%DXLelouch24> im immune to social pressure, i dont give a fuck what anyone thinks of me. COME AT ME
[1:13:11] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Sudden ultra violence
[1:13:11] <oda_flobunaga> Collective psychology is real, read Jung

[1:13:15] <Archmortal> Group think is fucking terrifying

[1:13:32] <totallystronk> Orcs IRL
[1:13:32] <%bravebravesrobin> this is why kobs are dangerous
[1:13:34] <oda_flobunaga> Karl Jung was right
[1:13:34] <+chaseyd> It's somewhat unrelated but Placebo had me believing I had cancer for a straight two years. My brain was replicating symptoms because I believed them so strongly.  The mind is too powerful.
[1:13:34] <%polothegreatest> like being easily drunk with friends
[1:13:34] <tanarath> Pat, this sounds like fucking magic.

[1:13:46] <Darthkitten_Prime> Society is dangerous. We should get rid of it
[1:13:47] <%hewlettfan96> Groupthink is terrifying and very real
[1:13:47] <+oldboy444> Dancing Plague of 1518 is an example of this
[1:13:47] <%lumporr> @Mrbaconator we're everything

[1:13:54] <OneThousandTomatoes> SMOrc WAAAAGH
[1:13:54] <%EmperorStarTurtle> MASS Hysteria is a thing. It convinced a group of nuns to start Meowing for hours.
[1:13:56] <Dunmarkh> Remember that soccer game where they decapitated the coach on the field and kept playing after?
[1:13:57] <%ThirdWelles> It's all about expectation

[1:14:02] <%drabberfaun535> How would you differentiate this from magic to a third party?
[1:14:03] <%Sotetsu> Isn't that kind of what Evangelion is about?
[1:14:03] <%BloodyBurney> is that essentially a panic attack?
[1:14:04] <HotMafia81> That magic drug is JEEEEEESUS
[1:14:05] <%HaroldDonchee> I like that line from MIB. a person is smart, people are dumb, dangerous animals. not 100% true but still good
[1:14:05] <%lumporr> @evbites that's totally real. look up johan de witt
[1:14:05] <IvanMistwalker> Is it possible to fight off the effects?
[1:14:07] <%bevyrage> btw fighting that social pressure outs you as someone capable of denying the social standards, which triggers the mob mentality to then target YOU because you're not aligning yourself with everyone else
[1:14:08] <+JonathLP> Does that mean Pat can infect Paige, Elmo and Zangief with Crazy Talk?
[1:14:08] <%chance_h> SMOrc

[1:15:36] <KingKZ> It's all just French
[1:15:36] <whittacre> quebequois is a patois
[1:15:36] <BigFingerRo> The scary part is that those weirdo churches present themselves not as extreme, but as an advanced church, for people who aren't getting the high from normal church anymore
[1:15:37] <%darklordfodder> Also we're a lot less nationalistic against Canadians.
[1:15:37] <%Deekman> Of course they wouldn’t lol

[1:15:38] <HotMafia81> That's what the French call it
[1:15:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> It's racism
[1:15:39] <%Frost_Quill> The only people who can go "Speak American" are Native Americans.

[1:16:34] <%BloodyBurney> great therapist
[1:16:35] <%polothegreatest> gone, like purgatory
[1:16:40] <%twohitgood> it's almost a different language, though. really, if a parisian and quebeccer need to speak english to understand each other, it's starting to reach the point of "yes, this is another language"
[1:16:40] <iswearimjustdandy> That is a weird specific gripe to have
[1:16:43] <churropoppa> ooooooooh so sorta like hoteps to foreigner
[1:16:44] <%Frost_Quill> You no longer exist if you have aspergers.
[1:16:46] <The_Murray_Carp> not your falt but is your responsibility yadyada
[1:16:49] <tolloponik> also asburgers has been debunked?!
[1:16:50] <+chaggles> yup
[1:16:50] <oda_flobunaga> *raise hand*
[1:16:51] <%ChestMimik> "Asshole" is a distinct diagnosis all its own
[1:16:51] <iosephe> yeah, probably
[1:16:51] <+Arnschen> Pat keeping up with the DSM
[1:16:52] <%shadowace2400> hi
[1:16:54] <%valriot> Yeah as someone with that, its NOT an excuse, it can be a cause for social bullshit but its like "fuck, sorry"
[1:16:55] <whittacre> everybody has autism, that's how you do math
[1:16:59] <%Teyaric> FUCK no - When that happened I was convinced I was "incompatible with humans"
[1:17:06] <Polyceramic> huh
[1:17:08] <%Frost_Quill> No one thinks they're a dick.  They always excuse it.
[1:17:08] <%sonuke_draws> pat is correct
[1:17:09] <captain_kirkhammer> where is "asshole" in the DSM5?
[1:17:12] <arizenarkana> AUTISM INFLUENCES HOW WE PROCESS SHIT NOT HOW WE BEHAVE.
[1:17:12] <%Agami23> yeah, no. thats fucked up.
[1:17:12] <LarcTC> some people function so well they dont even know theyre on the spectrum exactly. its such a huge variation
[1:17:14] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @tolloponik literally no. it's just rolled into autism spectrum
[1:17:15] <SaltyAzteca> Dont use your afflictions as some sort of moral high ground. Thats a jackass thing to do
[1:17:18] <zanzibarian_hamster> Curb your enthusiasm made fun of that
[1:17:18] <%AncelDeLambert> "Oh, I'm sorry, I'm having a moment, I guess. Sorry, it's a thing."
[1:17:20] <$sleepystardewfarmer> I'm autistic, and no, it's not an excuse
[1:17:21] <%ErikFeral> I never used my disability as an excuse.
[1:17:24] <EibhlinNicCathmhaoil> I'm literally neurodivergent and a minor!!!!!
[1:17:24] <%DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt my autism never caused me to be a dick to anyone, so thats SUS

[1:17:36] <luftraumm1> DSM is an important tool but shouldn't be the only one
[1:17:36] <%RetroCop87> I've been gone for an hour, how's the game?
[1:17:39] <+RainingTapes> as someone with autism when you fuck up you go "oh, can you explain to me what i did?" if you dont get it and then apologize, or you just apologize. You dont just hide behind it thats stupid
[1:17:39] <@SSaryn> @jekado 5?
[1:17:40] <%Profmcstevie> Diagnosed as "cunt"
[1:17:41] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Pat do you read the DSM occasionally?

[1:17:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> Fascinating. What illness makes me bad at video games?
[1:17:49] <%DSD24> Being an asshole is a disease
[1:17:50] <Visorak6> Is there a way to treat that?
[1:17:50] <NeroInfinite> "I can't helpit, I'm anti social."

[1:18:26] <captain_kirkhammer> something like 5% of all people isn't it
[1:18:26] <%darklordfodder> Fun fact, most psychopaths never murder anyone.
[1:18:29] <%bravebravesrobin> is everything a mental disorder?
[1:18:30] <%tusk102> i always forget that pat went to school for psychology

[1:18:33] <%PrimalDweeb> Oops...LUL
[1:18:34] <%Deekman> Yep
[1:18:34] <KingKZ> Last time I went to Gamestop, I had to actually look around for the games. So much other shit.
[1:18:37] <%pokefan9956> it's also incredibly difficult to treat because they won't acknowledge they have it
[1:18:38] <@SSaryn> True Crime in terms of Narcissism is fascinating though I'll be real.
[1:18:38] <$realm_forge> The cure for narcissism is a good punch to the face
[1:18:38] <%GarbageNirvana> What do you think a lot of our presidents were
[1:18:40] <dds333a> no one's saying it isn't am excuse, but it is categorized.

[1:18:59] <%IronOhki> Boy I'm sure glad Pat is an expert about brain.
[1:19:01] <+vaderxyz1970> My parents are narcissists who feed into each other in a self absorbed feed back loop
[1:19:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah. Sociopaths are not auto-bad people

[1:19:22] <Polyceramic> wait really??
[1:19:22] <%lumporr> huh
[1:19:23] <Visorak6> Does a sociopath lack all empathy or just certain forms?
[1:19:23] <%MidnightBurst12> morals can be learned
[1:19:24] <commanderapathy> @isolex_ narcissistic personality disorder I believe
[1:19:25] <%s_xylocalsingles> @dazdndcunfusd lmao thats a zine not a diagnosis, if its within your abilities and you care enough seek a trained professional, but dont self diagnose off the internet
[1:19:29] <%HunterSerge> Yeah I have autism and recently got diagnosed with ADHD too and using them as excuses is the thing i hate most, to the point where i would never mention my autism to anyone for years because i didn't wanna anyone else perceiving it as an excuse lol
[1:19:30] <%Anime_Flux> Wait, is that true?
[1:19:31] <%RealThiele> genetic soup
[1:19:31] <IvanMistwalker> VoteYea
[1:19:32] <Blackleafx> Pat, you played Shadowrun Hong Kong right? Racter is the fucking BEST representation of a sociopathic individual who isn't just a bad stereotype
[1:19:34] <Mazaari> Evolution selected for altruism.
[1:19:34] <iswearimjustdandy> Sociopaths are often the victims of violence too
[1:19:35] <%CTMathiu> a nature vs the nurture kind of thing
[1:19:36] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Pat will you be my psychology teacher when I get my MSW?
[1:19:38] <%Ne1son> Altruism is helpful in lthe long run
[1:19:38] <SeeAndShudder> Like the Archback gene in rats!
[1:19:40] <insomniac_doze_> cant you teach yourself to have empathy though
[1:19:40] <KingKZ> Pat, did you ace this class, because holy shit...
[1:19:41] <shyrstyne> i had a friend in high school who was probably sociopathic. she was cool though
[1:19:42] <@PeachSaliva> @chiazam lemme see if I can find it. If you search for it on TikTok, he’s a top user you can find him easily!
[1:19:44] <%Profmcstevie> The average person is good because otherwise we'd be wiped out
[1:19:45] <%Kirby_Sauce> so the uchiha DID have to go?
[1:19:45] <%DSD24> Wait so if I'm good right now does that mean my ancestors did it?
[1:19:45] <+smallboops> unless youre from philly...
[1:19:45] <%hewlettfan96> That’s certainly not true at all
[1:19:50] <%MacMog> babby with food sees a hungry babby, will share food
[1:19:50] <dds333a> I don't believe that at all

[1:20:01] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt then why do we create institutions that promote selfish antisocial behavior
[1:20:02] <%G_Thunders> Co-op > PVP, says evolution
[1:20:03] <%tusk102> if every human was a dickhead out for themselves, they would die out
[1:20:03] <%lumporr> @PatStaresAt what's the difference between feeling good by doing good and feeling bad by *not* doing good?
[1:20:06] <%twistedj3ster> Oh no my Dad's side is terrible!
[1:20:06] <%delilah4you> Do you think money causes mental illness
[1:20:07] <%Agami23> always try to be good to others
[1:20:10] <%Pappajimbo> the assholes got tied to a tree and left to the bears
[1:20:11] <%hewlettfan96> That makes sense
[1:20:13] <HotMafia81> This is the most informative bideo gaem strem I have ever been to.
[1:20:13] <%darklordfodder> Abnormal Psych is most psych majors' favorite class.
[1:20:14] <%ShogunNoonto> I used to play Magic the Gathering with sociopath  He was OK He was really hard to read though

[1:23:55] <@Ranryu692> Salem was cute compared to the witch hunts in Europe

[1:24:36] <+DuskSymphony01> Can you manifest bugs chewing through all of your cans via psychogenic symptoms?
[1:24:36] <+Arnschen> THAT ONE, YEAH THE PRAYING STUDY
[1:24:36] <Chatterbox1991> Don't forget the women who get giant bellies because they think they are pregnent when they arnt really
[1:24:37] <LegitBarnacleBoy> Ah yeah, the STEP studies by the Templeton Foundation
[1:24:37] <+soraabora> I’ve also heard like for the Salem witch trials, these girls were so used to just being ignored and having to be quiet that when they were suddenly super importantly, they wanted it to keep going
[1:24:38] <%crimsonharvest> or DO tell them that you're praying for them if you konw what i mean
[1:24:38] <staye100> Yeah, I heard that

[1:24:53] <+tomdwarf> Hey, remember that bit when you talked about how they give cute animals to old people, so that they live longer because of more positive outlook?
[1:24:53] <%hewlettfan96> Stress fucks your brain
[1:24:54] <%lumporr> i'm praying for you buddy, because WOOF. you're doing BAD. you're gonna need GOD.

[1:25:08] <mr_saturday93> thank you pat!
[1:25:08] <%bravebravesrobin> good thing I always am upbeat
[1:25:12] <oda_flobunaga> Well, there are too many people on the planet anyway, so maybe we should prey for each-other more
[1:25:13] <%ThirdWelles> What was it, like the brain gives up because it subconsciously believes it's no longer within the realm of mortal possibility for them to survive?
[1:25:16] <IvanMistwalker> take that religionists nutjobs.
[1:25:16] <OMEGAGUN3001> so i can start threating ppl with "thoughts and prayers"
[1:25:21] <%MacMog> thoughts and prayers makes shootings worse?
[1:25:22] <iswearimjustdandy> Its even deeper because in many religions nd and mentally ill people were often considered magic, which was considered a  good thing, but then christianity said magic is evil to dumb it doiwn a lot
[1:25:29] <mattdaddyd365> counter the prayers
[1:25:33] <%Pappajimbo> we evolved to see predators everywhere. monkey brain not work good
[1:25:38] <ShinyVagikarp> uhnRip uhnRip uhnRip
[1:25:39] <Majestic_Flof> Whats the name of the study?
[1:25:42] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Science killed people through religion.
[1:25:43] <%dankjerri> i just want people to hope im okay
[1:25:44] <SaltyDavid> So God killed them, got it
[1:25:44] <soundcloud_raptor> doesnt mean god isnt real, he just wants us dead
[1:25:45] <%ThirdWelles> The belief that a miracle was necessary to save them got their bodies to give up, right?
[1:25:46] <Visorak6> YOU GOT THIS CHAMP
[1:25:47] <%AncelDeLambert> because they were stressed out by the idea that they NEEDED to be prayed for
[1:25:47] <%hewlettfan96> That’s so sad to hear that their only resolve will make you more miserable
[1:25:48] <%RealThiele> Jesus took their life force
[1:25:48] <slothslayer828> what
[1:25:49] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt trauma and abuse can literally alter your enzyme processes and make you more susceptible to addiction
[1:25:49] <captain_kirkhammer> Did they correct for the religiosity of the subjects?
[1:25:53] <+justianxix> just tell them you prayed for them after the fact
[1:25:56] <%hewlettfan96> What are you supposed to do
[1:25:57] <SaltyAzteca> Its teh fear
[1:25:58] <+soraabora> Lmaoooo our priest told us the oppisite he like outright lied lmaoooo
[1:26:01] <+CrmznOgre> Would that not be determined on their outlook on prayer?
[1:26:02] <Archmortal> telling people they're in your thoughts and prayers is literally evil
[1:26:03] <+Ell1ot> the coma that turned you into a Pokemon for a bit?
[1:26:05] <%MacMog> whoa, Paige had a coma?
[1:26:07] <Angerest> up the spite!
[1:26:09] <Goergorion> cursed
[1:26:11] <+squishy_777> being told ppl are praying for you makes you think or are convinced youre gonna die lol
[1:26:11] <Yung_FckUp> be a villain to them and make them fight super hard to take revenge
[1:26:12] <IvanMistwalker> I believe in you buddy!
[1:26:15] <%bravebravesrobin> is that because if you think someone's praying for you, your less likely to try hard yourself?
[1:26:17] <%Frost_Quill> My grandfather had hip surgery and brain surgery back to back a few weeks ago and had a good outlook, and everything as far as we know went super well.
[1:26:18] <@PeachSaliva> @macmog looooong time ago
[1:26:18] <@SoFarFetched> puts them under the stress of "what if I dont make it"
[1:26:19] <%chance_h> The memes
[1:26:19] <tolloponik> damn you remember stuff out of text books longer than me that shit flew out of my brain
[1:26:21] <%Laecerelius> wow
[1:26:23] <%ThirdWelles> Only the outlook on the severity of their illness
[1:26:25] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @MacMog She is still in a coma
[1:26:26] <%dekkitout> Would the best thing to say be "Satan's rooting for you"?
[1:26:28] <+ReefTheWizard> man oh man ive been missing pat for 2 years fuck
[1:26:28] <MartinQ> What about a sense of pride & accomplishment?
[1:26:31] <+WinstonThrasher> its a reminder that theres a possibility that they can bite the big one
[1:26:32] <+Caidezes> Memes are powerful.
[1:26:33] <+pectusumbra> alright While I'm still lucking out gotta grab a shower before the show starts
[1:26:33] <%shruke> yo but what if the group that didn't know they got prayed for got worse too
[1:26:34] <lvl10cybermancer> Does the social pressure have anything to do with it?
[1:26:34] <$EibhlinNicCathmhaoil> If someone said they were praying for me I would just die out of spite
[1:26:35] <oda_flobunaga> Woooooooo Regression analysis baby!
[1:26:35] <%Pappajimbo> praying for me? I must be really fucked
[1:26:35] <LarcTC> fuck those praying guys but what if...
[1:26:35] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt humans social pressure being so powerful is why scarlet letter is on point literally forever
[1:26:37] <Parapattern> When you need to resort to prayer, you're likely in a bad way
[1:26:37] <Angerest> Give them SPITE FOR LIVING
[1:26:41] <+blaze__drag> yeah I remember getting so anxious when I first heard someone in my apartment complex got covid that I practically gave myself covid symptoms just worrying about it
[1:26:42] <%Profmcstevie> Passion helps the brain talk good
[1:26:43] <Notkai111> Okay but what about likes on facebook
[1:26:44] <%furiousfurioso> I imagine it ingrains a sense of "only god can help you now or you're done for"
[1:26:44] <T_Sasquatch> MEMES JACK
[1:26:45] <bakkatohri> Ketsu wo taberu means I eat ketsu < w <

[1:26:50] <+CrmznOgre> AH THE JESUS JUICE IS FLOWING INTO MY VEINS!
[1:26:52] <+smallboops> plot twist the synagogue was praying for them to die
[1:26:52] <%HaroldDonchee> I feel like for some people it could totally help though. like ultra religious
[1:26:54] <IvanMistwalker> Ah Bababooe
[1:26:56] <%Monkeyweed21> Trauma and abuse literally make you physically more susceptible to addiction @PatStaresAt

[1:27:07] <Dunmarkh> Everyone dies of shock technically
[1:27:09] <Visorak6> meme?
[1:27:09] <+The_Devil_Breaker> lmao just eating shit from sudden surprise
[1:27:09] <%purplestufff> dying of a broken heart also
[1:27:10] <Treasure_Vault> WHAT? *dead*
[1:27:10] <%pokefan9956> konosuba
[1:27:10] <+SilentTrinity> just came in is the stream over? ;w;
[1:27:12] <@Ranryu692> hyperbole
[1:27:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> as in surprise or blood loss, both are shock
[1:27:13] <@GeneralSCPatton> I feel like that was partly thinking things must be really bad, and part performance anxiety, because "what if I don't get better and become evidence against God?"
[1:27:14] <+squishy_777> the mind is powerful enough to kill you
[1:27:14] <%Broand> That fact is so shocking it's put me into shock
[1:27:14] <%VictorVonLouche> yes
[1:27:16] <%bob900000> Konosuba
[1:27:16] <%shadowace2400> so Padme wasn't full of shit?

[1:27:16] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @MacMog None of us are real.
[1:27:17] <+The_Devil_Breaker> someone should die like that in Halloween Ends
[1:27:18] <%Bluwizard21> that greek comedian that killed people through insults or laughing
[1:27:18] <SaltyAzteca> DIE OF KENSHIRO
[1:27:18] <%extradopeness> the heart just stop
[1:27:19] <gslayer14> darkest dungeon had it right
[1:27:20] <+vaderxyz1970> That's main cause of death in Sherlock Holmes novels
[1:27:21] <%ChestMimik> I would simply not be shocked
[1:27:21] <%dankjerri> thats why when you get shot on the battlefied, the medic says youll be fine
[1:27:21] <+SilentTrinity> OH
[1:27:22] <oda_flobunaga> they should have done that on mythbusters
[1:27:24] <@ssjklyco> I've said it earlier, the human mind is really amazing.
[1:27:26] <%Profmcstevie> Podcast 1.5
[1:27:26] <SpookyMooks> its been a big talk
[1:27:26] <+blaze__drag> it's okay in a game I play you can recover from shock by having people yell at you real hard
[1:27:27] <lloyddboy> Does this study include the elderly man who became too powerful after being prayed for
[1:27:28] <+ALazo> fuck it, psychology stream
[1:27:28] <jbrachob> Trauma blind chic from yakuza 0
[1:27:31] <%EternalJedi> it's super rare, but yeah, you can have such a psychological shock you just shut down
[1:27:38] <+SilentTrinity> ITS BEEN AN HOUR AND A HALF THOUGH?!
[1:27:38] <+tomdwarf> Were talking about psychosomatic stuff, group insanity, etc.
[1:27:40] <OkamiDude15> @SilentTrinity nope still pre stream talk
[1:27:42] <staye100> Brain legit says "Fuck this" and fucking dies
[1:27:49] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I have to go shopping, keep him talking about nonsense for about 25 minutes please
[1:27:50] <+SilentTrinity> perfect time i guess then lol
[1:27:55] <%hewlettfan96> Hmmmmm
[1:27:57] <mikesapartment> praying for a good stream
[1:27:58] <%lumporr> wait so if i think my medication won't work is it less likely to work?
[1:28:00] <LarcTC> you will develop bad gameplay from watch pressure
[1:28:03] <%Profmcstevie> Hello also oops not very video games so far

[1:28:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> its not always psych talk
[1:28:13] <OkamiDude15> a very educational bideo bame stream
[1:28:14] <%Deekman> “John”
[1:28:16] <+Arnschen> Good job
[1:28:17] <Coystick> [He usually talks about butts and farts]
[1:28:18] <%Pappajimbo> there is video games..eventually
[1:28:19] <%KetsuoTaberu> I was really hoping for that name to be a ligma
[1:28:21] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @Angerest What's the explanation for all those people that see the virgin Mary (Or whatever religious figure) at the same time?
[1:28:22] <%hewlettfan96> Praying for a good stream although that’s bad for the health apparently
[1:28:22] <%thedankestmeeme> PAT YOUR BALLS ARE OUT no pressure
[1:28:24] <@ssjklyco> Nibbling ma hole?
[1:28:26] <%scaryboisupreme> x files is based

[1:28:30] <Hmhya> the twitch trials
[1:28:32] <SpookyMooks> de Aliems
[1:28:33] <%za7az> No pressure Pat because you always knock it out of the park psaUp

[1:28:35] <+ReefTheWizard> did he just say the twitch trials?
[1:28:36] <@SSaryn> Oh fuck it's happening the cards
[1:28:37] <Mazaari> Good luck playing this game! Its good and really atmospheric!
[1:28:39] <+SilentTrinity> i was always afraid of the opening as a child but i still remember liking it when i did watch it
[1:28:40] <$EibhlinNicCathmhaoil> You nailed it pat
[1:28:40] <%MacMog> at the same time, I think current evidence says multiple personalities is fake, the patients acting out subconsciously to please their researcher-therapists
[1:28:41] <%lumporr> how i believe the good things and not the bad things
[1:28:43] <dds333a> you too? I had a friend wh owa terrified if it LUL
[1:28:47] <matsu_me> you already got probed by that nurse, aliens should be fine
[1:28:48] <zanzibarian_hamster> bideo gaem
[1:28:49] <@Ranryu692> Pat didn't watch X-Files because he thought it was too serious a subject to make a TV show about lol
[1:28:49] <+ReefTheWizard> @Hmhya yeah!
[1:28:53] <%Laecerelius> So Joel, Vinny, AND Pat were all scared of aliens
[1:28:56] <%Kirby_Sauce> pat's fear of aliens will make them real

It was a time in the 1900s where, after TB spread through a town, the locals decided Jimmy in the grave was a vampire slowly killing them. Different regions had different solutions from burning the TB ridden corpes, or eating their heart as a town! This shit inspired Bram Stoker to write Dracula. Man we had a lot of "paranormal" shit in this region.

[2:02:28] <%tadaosmad> This is a turn
[2:02:29] <%skizzuto> Center two rows are in play, top and bottom are hands
[2:02:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Think of it as a mini version of the card game you've been playing

[2:02:37] <+Arnschen> Damage from your side
[2:02:38] <%Piemono> Oh its the game board
[2:02:38] <%asgard147> limesThink maybe how much damage you do?
[2:02:40] <reonome> check what the skink does pat
[2:02:40] <%HaroldDonchee> oh wow. that was way less complex than I thought it was
[2:02:40] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[2:02:41] <%tadaosmad> It is
[2:02:41] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, you don't know what the tail means
[2:02:41] <+blaze__drag> you have to arrange it to deal 5 damage to the opponent
[2:02:44] <%sirisvirus> you need to do 5 damage one turn
[2:02:44] <SaltyDavid> How can this BE
[2:02:49] <%josstil> you would need to know how the skink works
[2:02:49] <fuji_n2> that's the board pat
[2:02:51] <+nictron90> You might want to look up what that lizard symbol means
[2:02:55] <%bevyrage> pat look up what the tail means in the rules
[2:02:55] <cgreene64> pat pls
[2:02:55] <%WordsHere> Maybe you need more information
[2:02:55] <+nictron90> and how it works
[2:02:56] <jorniev> I CANT belive you solve the puzzles by learning how to play the game thats NUTS
[2:02:57] <%BigCoffee> Is this game like a roguelike?
[2:02:58] <+TheNommad> DIG UP STUPID
[2:02:59] <+toastybites> their units are tanking
[2:02:59] <%sirisvirus> the tail does something look at the rule book
[2:03:00] <scrumbotime> Maybe find out what the lizard symbol does?
[2:03:00] <+Arnschen> Some pieces are locked
[2:03:02] <%JoshManVGH> Slide all the buttons
[2:03:03] <+bytex678> nah brute forcing works just fine
[2:03:03] <%tadaosmad> Nope! Skink
[2:03:03] <+JonathLP> The symbol
[2:03:03] <+pectusumbra> yeah look up your new card
[2:03:04] <LoneFonte> tail symbol
[2:03:04] <bimblewort> IF you don't know what some of the symbols mean, you can come back once you do
[2:03:04] <%DovaDude29> It’s a mock turn setup
[2:03:05] <%josstil> skinks are built different
[2:03:05] <%SirGO0SE> limesNope
[2:03:06] <ergulor> that icon means something
[2:03:07] <%GarbageNirvana> Is trample a thing in this game?
[2:03:07] <Goergorion> the abilities
[2:03:08] <gslayer14> what does lizard do?
[2:03:09] <NeroInfinite> pat can't do math
[2:03:10] <reonome> the sigils mean something pat
[2:03:10] <%ahomeschooldropout> Lol CDPR delayed the next gen versions of CP2077 and Witcher 3 until next year, including the major updates for PC
[2:03:12] <lvl10cybermancer> It doesn't show the game effects but the skink is doing something
[2:03:14] <TopTierHarley> Brute force works fine
[2:03:14] <+cubbywolf> the give up
[2:03:19] <Louie_Salmon> The tail symbol is weird
[2:03:20] <%chance_h> Blockers

[2:03:27] <%bevyrage> or was it A or D
[2:03:28] <bobdoletrasher> A D
[2:03:30] <+cubbywolf> he randomly clicked through the first one, i'm sure it'll work again
[2:03:31] <%josstil> wasd
[2:03:32] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> look up the tail effect
[2:03:33] <%BogBodyPositive> what does lizard mean
[2:03:37] <%RealThiele> mousewheel works in game iirc
[2:03:37] <+blaze__drag> I love how all the rules are written on the top 1 inch of each page
[2:03:40] <%josstil> yeah, he cheats
[2:03:43] <%ChestMimik> BONE LORD
[2:03:47] <SaltyAzteca> BONE LORD SOUNDS METAL
[2:03:47] <$dellakitty> I have no idea what's going on.
[2:03:48] <+yuribo26> So many keywords
[2:03:49] <+bytex678> i just played around with the slides until i got 5/5 i had no idea

[2:03:51] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt Go back to the map, then press W a few times and you can see your deck

[2:03:58] <+Osiris410> B O N E L O R D
[2:03:59] <yourliteraldog> So they finally admit that Cyberpunk 2077 was suposed to run on last gen hardware lol
[2:04:00] <%josstil> he doesn't even give you a complete rule book
[2:04:01] <%BogBodyPositive> BEES
[2:04:05] <%Laecerelius> huh
[2:04:08] <%Master_Van> Master_Van subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[2:04:10] <%dankjerri> ...token?
[2:04:14] <%tadaosmad> There it is, if you hit it it spawns a token
[2:04:16] <+Arnschen> Like a lizard
[2:04:16] <%Piemono> Tail takes dmg then?
[2:04:17] <%tusk102> lizard drops its tail to take the damage
[2:04:18] <%Forbidden_Karp> escape tail!
[2:04:18] <%bevyrage> so when you attack the skink it runs to the next space, which is why your damage was getting blocked
[2:04:19] <%twohitgood> it drops its tail like a lizard
[2:04:20] <%sirisvirus> so its blocking 2 attacks
[2:04:22] <%Laecerelius> So it needs a free space to move to?
[2:04:25] <+pectusumbra> cutting off the tail as the japanese saying goes
[2:04:27] <+SilentTrinity> so keep it on the left side so that when it gets hit it moves over one to the right? interesting
[2:04:27] <+Arnschen> So they all block
[2:04:28] <SaltyDavid> It doesn't tell you what a tail is tho
[2:04:29] <+nictron90> So don't strike it
[2:04:29] <%josstil> you are doing 0 player damage
[2:04:31] <%HaroldDonchee> I like how Satan just chills in the room while you fuck around
[2:04:32] <Maleicus> it moves and a tail takes it place
[2:04:33] <+bytex678> just bruteforce it
[2:04:34] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[2:04:34] <%MacMog> @bogbodypositive barrNaboo barrNablegh barrNaboo barrNablegh
[2:04:36] <bobdoletrasher> @PatStaresAt then dont hit it :)
[2:04:36] <+nictron90> sorry that w as probably too far
[2:04:37] <monopolyman001> its a thinker
[2:04:39] <+cubbywolf> he has no idea
[2:04:45] <%lumporr> ohhh
[2:04:45] <TopTierHarley> so close
[2:04:45] <@SoFarFetched> geefSrsly
[2:04:48] <%sirisvirus> flyer is blocked
[2:04:50] <%Forbidden_Karp> oh I think I see it
[2:04:50] <bimblewort> he'll get it
[2:04:50] <%bevyrage> he's so close
[2:04:51] <+Jack8274> Flyer and anti flyer
[2:04:51] <+Ryaotz> moves right
[2:04:52] <%Piemono> Got it
[2:04:53] <%skizzuto> You're almost there
[2:04:58] <lvl10cybermancer> It's because the skink is shedding it's tail and moving to the right, it just doesn't show it in this puzzle
[2:05:00] <Majestic_Flof> Maybe try to play with the cards to understand?
[2:05:00] <%tadaosmad> Skink goes to the right, blocks 3/2
[2:05:00] <%josstil> you can move the opponents pieces to your side as well
[2:05:01] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat, hand it to Paige, let her do the big thinking for you.
[2:05:01] <cgreene64> pat pls
[2:05:02] <reonome> look at the borders for the cards you can move
[2:05:02] <%BogBodyPositive> I do not get this either
[2:05:04] <@SoFarFetched> Alright chat now we have only us to talk with each other
[2:05:08] <+bytex678> you don't have to understand it just move 1 tile til it works
[2:05:08] <sandsim> lmao I would have no idea
[2:05:08] <scrumbotime> Tail
[2:05:09] <Essixian> @PatStaresAt Because when that lizard gets hit, it moves to the right and blocks your 3 damage card
[2:05:10] <+Arnschen> The tail
[2:05:10] <@SoFarFetched> while his gears b urn
[2:05:10] <+JonathLP> NO ELP
[2:05:10] <ergulor> the skin eats the damage
[2:05:11] <%bevyrage> oh fuck me it's a real shadow puzzle moment
[2:05:12] <%Piemono> Lizard moves right
[2:05:12] <acridpaladin> because it keeps moving ot the right
[2:05:12] <reonome> the skink blocks two cards
[2:05:13] <+pectusumbra> I think the lizard KEEPS moving?
[2:05:13] <ergulor> skink
[2:05:14] <%sirisvirus> cause the lizard moves
[2:05:14] <%Teyaric> Hit Tail - Make EXTRA mob
[2:05:14] <%VictorVonLouche> you read why
[2:05:15] <%holydeviant1> because it moves
[2:05:16] <+jennyfurific> its so funny watching pat be dumb
[2:05:16] <%JoshManVGH> Cause somethibg blocked the 3
[2:05:17] <bobdoletrasher> @PatStaresAt the tail
[2:05:18] <+nictron90> Because hte 2/1 goes to hit it, it moves right and blocks the 3/2
[2:05:19] <%josstil> the skink is body blocking the other space
[2:05:21] <cgreene64> The lizard moves over to block two attacks
[2:05:21] <%RealThiele> tail used confusion its super effective
[2:05:23] <Loxoron> When he kills the skunk it moves to his right no matter what
[2:05:23] <+chiazam> HOW CAN THIS BE
[2:05:23] <$Count_Long> reee
[2:05:24] <%justcallmebobplease> I want to see Paige casually crush this, and Pat take psychic damage like in RE.
[2:05:25] <Louie_Salmon> No help from friend

[2:05:33] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[2:05:34] <%chance_h> The tail makes a blocking decoy and the 1 moves

[2:06:00] <Parapattern> Oh lord
[2:06:04] <%bevyrage> time to learn ANT ARMY
[2:06:06] <+Arnschen> Learn about ants now
[2:06:07] <@SoFarFetched> can we get another brute force
[2:06:08] <%josstil> ants are cool
[2:06:11] <lvl10cybermancer> You can just look in your deck and right click them
[2:06:14] <%holydeviant1> Game master is being super patient
[2:06:18] <TopTierHarley> wrong ant
[2:06:19] <Louie_Salmon> These are tough, feel free to revisit these later as well
[2:06:26] <+mitchyb603> so never ending ants
[2:06:26] <+pectusumbra> that's the ant in the square
[2:06:28] <%josstil> ants attack are based on the number of ants in play
[2:06:28] <akitanito> ants in your hands
[2:06:29] <%DovaDude29> Ants are like the skeleton cards
[2:06:29] <%tusk102> isnt there a deck menu?
[2:06:30] <SaltyDavid> wrong ant
[2:06:31] <%WordsHere> Different ant symbol
[2:06:31] <+chiazam> Woolie could play this all day
[2:06:32] <%Nobody404> @PatStaresAt that's not the ant symbol lol
[2:06:33] <@SoFarFetched> you say this but he's brute forced 3 things so far Kappa
[2:06:33] <LoneFonte> different sigil
[2:06:34] <%bevyrage> different ant sigil, this one is on attack, and not in a card box
[2:06:35] <%tadaosmad> @patstaresat Ant damage = number of ants in the board
[2:06:35] <Louie_Salmon> There's multiple ant effects
[2:06:35] <Maleicus> theres another ant effect
[2:06:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> feel free to try later, after you've grown familiar with ants
[2:06:39] <+cubbywolf> my brain!
[2:06:41] <gslayer14> ant damage
[2:06:43] <%dekkitout> 4 reel?
[2:06:44] <%Teintstein> Teintstein subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! differant
[2:06:47] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah you know,your ants and uncles
[2:06:51] <+SpinalWizard> I think you have an attack value of "ant"
[2:06:51] <%RealThiele> giving undying to ant queen Kreygasm
[2:06:53] <lvl10cybermancer> You can go look at the cards in your deck and right click them
[2:06:55] <%ChestMimik> Just think chat, the demon is stuck with him
[2:06:57] <lvl10cybermancer> It'll get you there faster
[2:06:57] <%lumporr> CHRIST THERE'S A LOT
[2:07:04] <%DovaDude29> Ant damage multiplied for the number of ants in play
[2:07:04] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @sofarfetched booo booo with the ant puns
[2:07:05] <+nictron90> It basically just means attack power = number of ants
[2:07:06] <+sonofthedeepsouth> ANTS
[2:07:08] <+bytex678> just keep playing the game will teach ou the ant mechanic in the next fight
[2:07:11] <LegitBarnacleBoy> that the OWNER has
[2:07:14] <+Ricky_Rexx> the more ants the more attack
[2:07:19] <gslayer14> ant tribal
[2:07:20] <jtsoppy137> more ants more power
[2:07:21] <%HaroldDonchee> I mean this does make your deck way more complex early on right?
[2:07:22] <Essixian> Mo' ants mo' damage
[2:07:24] <%holydeviant1> 4 ants = 4 damage
[2:07:26] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Ant war?
[2:07:27] <+Arnschen> So they're X/X based on how many ants you have
[2:07:29] <+pectusumbra> so you have 4 ants so each ant does 4 it seems
[2:07:30] <%bevyrage> hoo boy
[2:07:34] <%dankjerri> oh so its Mob
[2:07:34] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I feel like going AFK when Pat started playing was a bad idea, because I have no idea how this game works.
[2:07:47] <%tadaosmad> @HaroldDonchee Yep
[2:07:48] <%bevyrage> yup, mob stat for ants
[2:07:55] <%dankjerri> magic
[2:08:05] <augusta_wind> @NigelSchnauzerpug i'm in the same boat
[2:08:05] <sirrice77> @NigelSchnauzerpug it's okay pats not really sure how it works either
[2:08:06] <aln1yat> brute forcing puzzle pog
[2:08:08] <%bevyrage> flyer blocked by great leap
[2:08:12] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I know I know I've let you down...
[2:08:13] <+toastybites> Pat the animals in the back row cant defend against your attack
[2:08:21] <reonome> nice
[2:08:21] <akitanito> brutesmart
[2:08:21] <%josstil> gg
[2:08:23] <+Arnschen> There we go
[2:08:23] <%bevyrage> he did it
[2:08:23] <+yuribo26> Pack rat mechanics Pog
[2:08:25] <SaltyAzteca> Good ol brute force!!
[2:08:27] <%tadaosmad> I actually bruteforced all puzzles on this
[2:08:29] <+sonofthedeepsouth> He did it
[2:08:30] <+cubbywolf> poor wolfo
[2:08:32] <@SoFarFetched> MORE BRUTE FORCE geefSnap
[2:08:33] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Use the Heart of The Cards Pat!
[2:08:33] <%Teh_Un> This is the hard one
[2:08:33] <%tusk102> yeyeye
[2:08:33] <+blaze__drag> I think the reason you're struggling is because the abilities matter
[2:08:35] <+Ricky_Rexx> the hard one
[2:08:36] <%RealThiele> hoo boy
[2:08:40] <%bevyrage> time to read!
[2:08:42] <%josstil> this one is super hard
[2:08:43] <jtsoppy137> Mantis GOD
[2:08:46] <+Arnschen> Let's read up
[2:08:48] <%tadaosmad> Because god forbid I didn't understand
[2:08:49] <%tusk102> hoooooo boy
[2:08:51] <%RealThiele> Ligma sigil
[2:08:59] <%DovaDude29> Oh boy this one doing numbers
[2:09:04] <Maleicus> no mantis god is also middle
[2:09:08] <%HaroldDonchee> can you hit your own guys?
[2:09:09] <%dankjerri> even my head hurts
[2:09:11] <%Saadi90> This one is tough AF
[2:09:11] <%tadaosmad> Bifurcated attack, hits diagonals
[2:09:12] <+bytex678> just brute force always works
[2:09:16] <%Piemono> spikey guys reduce dmg of cards hitting them
[2:09:20] <reonome> so close
[2:09:28] <+sonofthedeepsouth> It all comes tumbling down
[2:09:34] <@SoFarFetched> no keep brute forcing
[2:09:35] <%bevyrage> man it legit hurts seeing the solution and pat not getting it, but this one did take me a bit to figure out... and i needed help
[2:09:37] <+DynDimAcsiwn> I don't understand these puzzles at all
[2:09:38] <%josstil> yeah, it's real tough
[2:09:43] <%twohitgood> the split damage goes into the left to the left and to the right of the card.
[2:09:47] <reonome> this one is hard
[2:09:52] <SaltyAzteca> Just keep slidin em, itll solve itself LUL
[2:09:52] <fuji_n2> keep trying
[2:09:54] <The_Murray_Carp> left to right
[2:09:54] <kinkade_77> these seem a bit too difficult to understand
[2:09:59] <%twistedj3ster> disc room?
[2:09:59] <%RealThiele> lizard likely blocking  lot of dmg here
[2:10:01] <%DovaDude29> Just play more of the cards then come back to this one
[2:10:03] <TopTierHarley> it's not
[2:10:04] <gslayer14> kill it with spiky
[2:10:04] <+bytex678> @bevyrage i never understood it i just bruteforced until i got 5/5 :P
[2:10:10] <%josstil> i struggled with this one for at least a half hour
[2:10:11] <%bevyrage> slot 2 won't be able to attack the skink if it's dead before it attacks the skink
[2:10:12] <lvl10cybermancer> Attacks also resolve left to right if that helps
[2:10:12] <+blaze__drag> when the lizard dies it moves
[2:10:14] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I miss D I S C R O O M
[2:10:15] <Louie_Salmon> I did this one and still don't understand it
[2:10:18] <%dankjerri> cheat
[2:10:18] <%livlinn> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:10:21] <%whyskeywolfe> The fuck is even happening
[2:10:22] <tlflordhand> Pattie boi just gonna brute force it like he does all these puzzles
[2:10:22] <%tadaosmad> @kinkade_77 It's a little hard if you're not playing the sigils in the main game
[2:10:28] <TopTierHarley> @josstil really?
[2:10:28] <LegitBarnacleBoy> remember, attacks proceed in order from left to right
[2:10:29] <The_Murray_Carp> strikes happen from left to right
[2:10:31] <+Ricky_Rexx> Ngl I kinda beat ths one by just randomly clicking shit
[2:10:32] <%MacMog> seven cards, each in two possible positions, pow(2, 7) = 128
[2:10:41] <@SoFarFetched> dont be book smart,be BRUTE smart geefSmart
[2:10:45] <TopTierHarley> you don't need to play them in game, just use rule book and he'll be fine
[2:10:55] <+bytex678> we can brute force this no need to be smart
[2:10:57] <Louie_Salmon> Ooooh I get it now
[2:11:02] <%VictorVonLouche> why block the 3?
[2:11:03] <NeroInfinite> because of skink
[2:11:06] <Ultimatefool> This is a really good puzzle, loved solving this one
[2:11:11] <EpicLagg> why is he making the enemy defend?
[2:11:11] <reonome> skink
[2:11:12] <%tadaosmad> I tried doing it using the rulebook but my mind blew
[2:11:19] <%BogBodyPositive> maybe we come back to it?
[2:11:26] <$Count_Long> i brute forced this yesterday cause i didnt get it
[2:11:31] <Loxoron> Your half is the bottom half of the board
[2:11:33] <LegitBarnacleBoy> attacks always proceed from left to right, and they each happen individually
[2:11:39] <%BinaryFireball> you hjust have to get 5 dmg ya?
[2:11:39] <TopTierHarley> he's getting it
[2:11:39] <Loxoron> It’s possible now
[2:11:41] <%bevyrage> so close
[2:11:42] <%bevyrage> dammit
[2:11:43] <+bytex678> yep bruteforce worked fine for me didn't try to understand even
[2:11:46] <%BinaryFireball> is that the idea?
[2:11:47] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah this one might get easier once you actually use these effects in the game
[2:11:47] <tlflordhand> puzzles in this are def more challenging than Hand of Fate
[2:11:51] <reonome> LUL
[2:11:52] <The_Murray_Carp> skink
[2:11:53] <%BloodyBurney> i get it
[2:11:53] <+Futuretimetraveller> LUL
[2:11:53] <TopTierHarley> LUL
[2:11:56] <akitanito> lol
[2:11:56] <%tadaosmad> I DON'T KNOW
[2:11:56] <@SoFarFetched> TOO LATE
[2:11:56] <%Ne1son> Read the rules
[2:11:56] <NeroInfinite> he did it
[2:11:57] <Hyphen_Sum> Why would someone make an abacus like this?
[2:11:57] <%holydeviant1> movement, pat
[2:11:58] <@SoFarFetched> BRUTE FORCE WINS
[2:11:58] <%redthebaron> it kills your thingy
[2:11:59] <%vivaldiva> LUL
[2:11:59] <%RealThiele> LUL
[2:11:59] <Essixian> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
[2:12:00] <LarcTC> he doesnt know
[2:12:00] <@SoFarFetched> ONCE AGAIN
[2:12:01] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:12:02] <lvl10cybermancer> Because the bifurcated attacker dies to the thorns before it can hit hte skink
[2:12:03] <%Nobody404> @PatStaresAt the bifurcated strikes are hitting thel izard twice and killing it
[2:12:04] <%livlinn> psaUp psaBlind psaUp
[2:12:04] <@SoFarFetched> BRUTE FORCE EVERYTHING
[2:12:04] <+nictron90> Because the first bifurcate dies to the spike and doesn't hit the skink, which otherwise stopped the 3/2
[2:12:05] <+sonofthedeepsouth> TOO LATE
[2:12:07] <%VictorVonLouche> kill the Tail
[2:12:08] <bimblewort> split hitting the spikes means it doesn't hit the skink, so the three can go in
[2:12:09] <LegitBarnacleBoy> @PatStaresAt walk through each attack from left to right
[2:12:12] <The_Murray_Carp> your guy dies before it hits the skink
[2:12:12] <+MrTurtleThief> 2 hits
[2:12:13] <Spagheddies> Check the Tail sigil.
[2:12:13] <+sonofthedeepsouth> YOU WILL NEVER KNOW
[2:12:13] <Goergorion> he is going crazy
[2:12:13] <%redthebaron> so the tail don't stop the wolf
[2:12:13] <Maleicus> rat head too good
[2:12:13] <%bevyrage> porcupine kills pronghorn which leads to the skink not getting attacked meaning it doesn't block the wolf on the end
[2:12:14] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> BECAUSE PAT. BECAUSE
[2:12:14] <tlflordhand> don't worry bout it Lisa
[2:12:16] <reonome> thorns
[2:12:16] <%Piemono> Cause spikeys reduce the power of guy hitting lizard
[2:12:16] <+bytex678> zero clue bruteforce is KING
[2:12:17] <%josstil> because the porcupine hurt your guy, which kept it from hitting the skink
[2:12:17] <peyodogo> el no sabe LUL
[2:12:18] <soflicar> the multi hit is dying to the one on the left not hitting the salamander
[2:12:18] <Sypheck> is this a puzzle game?
[2:12:19] <Ultimatefool> The leftmost bifurcation hits the Spikes, then cancels the skink hit
[2:12:20] <TheMadBadger> It kills your lizard, so it doesn't hit the skink.
[2:12:20] <+SilentTrinity> the arrows dont attack straight the attack left and right of the spot ahead of it
[2:12:20] <peyodogo> (i don't either)
[2:12:21] <%BloodyBurney> order of operations is left to right
[2:12:21] <chikitsune9> the first mantis dies to porcupine
[2:12:23] <%Teintstein> the reward for brute forcing is IGNORANCE
[2:12:23] <Louie_Salmon> Attacks resolve left to right
[2:12:23] <MaesePC> dont think, only press buttons! KEKW
[2:12:23] <aeonicVector> 1/1 dies to 1/2, never moving tail
[2:12:23] <%BinaryFireball> looks like 4 not 5
[2:12:24] <%sirisvirus> the porcupine hits the direction the spines are facing
[2:12:25] <cherrycottontail> the thorns kills the first mantis before the skink blocks the right
[2:12:25] <%Ipsenscastle> WTF I looked away for a bit and now the game is weird
[2:12:25] <LoreKeeper_Thal> oh i get it
[2:12:28] <%DovaDude29> Because skink makes a tail
[2:12:29] <%tadaosmad> OOh shit! Now I get it
[2:12:31] <%HaroldDonchee> ask stoat for help
[2:12:32] <%Dingus_Tickler> Dingus_Tickler subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 57 months, currently on a 57 month streak! This game is tight
[2:12:33] <NeroInfinite> yep
[2:12:35] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Num sei?
[2:12:36] <lvl10cybermancer> It DOESN'T hit the skink, it dies first
[2:12:38] <+yuribo26> ACTUALLY LEARNING
[2:12:39] <+MrTurtleThief> The two middle cards do two hits right?
[2:12:42] <TopTierHarley> Brute Smarts
[2:12:45] <MaesePC> first try! LUL
[2:12:47] <%shootbang_exe> how much  is this game?
[2:12:49] <BackflipCharm> No it hits the spike on the left, kills it, keeps the tail from happening at all and lets the two on the right hit for 2+3 damage
[2:12:50] <$realm_forge> BUT BAA BAA
[2:12:50] <%NitronStreams> Congratulations

[2:13:47] <%SharkMissile> STINK YOURSELF coward
[2:13:47] <%tadaosmad> They must be made
[2:13:47] <%Ipsenscastle> Pat's card should've been STINKY
[2:13:48] <%Nobody404> make pat stinky for accuracy
[2:13:50] <%twohitgood> the roach ability, tho
[2:13:51] <+blaze__drag> sacrifice PAT
[2:13:52] <%dankjerri> cockroach can never die
[2:13:53] <$Count_Long> dude the split attack power is OP. When you get a 7 power card that does split attack, you just WIN
[2:13:54] <SaltyDavid> Very important to know you can have more than 1 sigil on a card
[2:13:54] <Essixian> YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF STINKY
[2:13:55] <bigb00gi3> skink with cockroach's sigil is nutso if you're taking tips
[2:13:55] <%josstil> SIGILS STACK
[2:13:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> omg
[2:13:57] <chikitsune9> Make Pat Live forever
[2:13:57] <bimblewort> if you put the roach onto the stinkbug its just straight up better, actually. huh
[2:14:02] <%twistedj3ster> wow that picture came out terrible
[2:14:02] <+bytex678> @HaroldDonchee nah nothing happens just goes in discard pile
[2:14:02] <cherrycottontail> PUT SOUL OF PAT IN STINK BUG
[2:14:04] <%redthebaron> cockroach?
[2:14:05] <cherrycottontail> UH OH STINKY
[2:14:07] <%bevyrage> check out roach again
[2:14:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeye make yourself stinky
[2:14:09] <%josstil> YOU CAN HAVE MORE THAN 1
[2:14:09] <+pectusumbra> skinks seem REAL good from those puzzles
[2:14:16] <%HaroldDonchee> I'd say roach. hard to summon
[2:14:16] <jtsoppy137> pat is kinda you worst card
[2:14:21] <SaltyDavid> MAKE PAT STINKY DO IT
[2:14:22] <%Monkeyweed21> sacrifice the cockroach seems good
[2:14:23] <Visorak6> I second soul of pat in stink bug LUL
[2:14:23] <+Arnschen> Stinky Pat, or Skinky Pat
[2:14:24] <%tadaosmad> You can do whatever here really
[2:14:28] <gslayer14> kill pat
[2:14:31] <+bytex678> you can make pat unkillable
[2:14:31] <%bevyrage> pat is not the worst card
[2:14:36] <%KetsuoTaberu> Pat? monkaS
[2:14:37] <%DovaDude29> @cherrycottontail no itt would be put stinky on pat
[2:14:42] <%shootbang_exe> kinda wish the pat card had an actual face but I can see why it doesn't
[2:14:45] <Cirren> Stoat Pog

[2:22:18] <BackflipCharm> Conceding is a trap sometimes Try playing a match out
[2:22:19] <%bevyrage> it's a good value to be able to hit someone directly
[2:22:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah but they also IGNORE the people that are in front to attack directly. Can be a really good combo with other shit. But that's late game.

[3:07:31] <grimwire1> and ya can use it to make a death card out of it for cost
[3:07:31] <spuginky> "this reminds me of card night at granpas house"

[3:07:37] <%tadaosmad> Ouro can get 10/10
[3:07:37] <Wolfstriker121> ouroboros chrisssssss
[3:07:38] <+thecowpow> BIG MONSTER...
[3:07:38] <BackflipCharm> Ouro is correct but Geck is love
[3:07:38] <+JonathLP> Ouroboros or geck are both good
[3:07:38] <skagtheprinceofhell> No real bad choice here

[3:07:42] <+rafaelba93> geck is useful
[3:07:42] <nappingplant> ourobros
[3:07:42] <%Broand> Ouroboros won me a set

[3:07:53] <tanarath> Weird symbol in the geckjs top left, you do you
[3:07:56] <lvl10cybermancer> @tadaosmad Ouro can get WAY MORE than 10/10
[3:07:56] <%A_Zealous_Retort> oroboros can BREAK the game with circular summoning to farm its power up and get bone tokens
[3:07:57] <%dankjerri> new map
[3:07:59] <%bevyrage> @bimblewort mana is different in this game, this is a sack 4 to get a 7/7
[3:07:59] <+eggstyr0ne> 7/7 is only good to use as a death card
[3:08:02] <MrPandastic> it permanently buffs itself everytime you sack it
[3:08:02] <+chiazam> wesker time

[3:40:28] <Spagheddies> Stalemate.
[3:40:33] <nappingplant> this is fine
[3:40:33] <Vlesh> Stalemate
[3:40:35] <%dekkitout> Stall strats
[3:40:40] <+Ricky_Rexx> why do you keep losing? if it wre me I would simply not?
[3:40:41] <%twohitgood> stalemate is fine since you can just get more mana
[3:40:43] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> so much teeth
[3:40:44] <+itsgundamu> SOOO MANY TEETH
[3:40:46] <jessegorilla> high octane gameplay
[3:40:47] <%HaroldDonchee> I'm kinda surprised he doesn't have a line for that happening
[3:40:50] <Vlesh> Turtle in the corner, Pat
[3:41:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> damn dis funneh
[3:41:08] <+Grayhammatter> that pronghorn is wack
[3:41:15] <+Ricky_Rexx> you got a squirrel in a bottle
[3:41:16] <%Conraderino45> Conraderino45 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! Three years is an alright amount of time
[3:41:21] <%CappuccinoGuil> just keep skipping LUL

[3:41:38] <%bevyrage> save items for when you need them @Ricky_Rexx
[3:41:43] <+Ricky_Rexx> @nictron90 at least 5
[3:41:44] <+MisterAvry> I just tuned in and what the hell
[3:41:46] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> it's like when equal strength anime shonen protags start hitting each other back and forth
[3:41:48] <LegitBarnacleBoy> you have a card that specifically gives you more items, why not use them more?
[3:41:57] <%tadaosmad> Welp
[3:41:58] <The_Game_Geek> wasted backpack space
[3:41:58] <+Ricky_Rexx> @bevyrage but make room to get more
[3:42:02] <calaska140> pat did the not lose maneuver I taught him
[3:42:06] <%The_Protagonist> the downside was you're a FAILURE
[3:42:07] <+Myopicvision91> @LegitBarnacleBoy he has 3 items
[3:42:08] <+the22cstomp> @LegitBarnacleBoy mind goblins
[3:42:09] <%solracc25> smart
[3:42:11] <%bevyrage> his pack was full so he couldn't get more items anyway
[3:42:12] <+Grayhammatter> another pack rat PogChamp

[3:42:13] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> psaGiefrail

[3:42:25] <Zerud> ratjam
[3:42:26] <+MisterAvry> rack pat
[3:42:29] <@SoFarFetched> everyone go take a big pee
[3:42:29] <ohno778> believe in the heart of the cards
[3:42:31] <Reveresao> Whats that backgorund? Look cool
[3:42:35] <FaceRekt> coxJam
[3:42:42] <%The_Protagonist> @MisterAvry Pat's rack
[3:42:45] <iswearimjustdandy> I need a big pee as well so
[3:42:55] <+MisterAvry> everyone drink some water, too
[3:42:58] <The_Game_Geek> i need to keep playing this game but i also wanna see pat react to the hype shit
[3:43:10] <calaska140> everyone get a nice cool glass of pee
[3:43:21] <+Jay667b> @The_Game_Geek It'll be up on youtube eventually
[3:43:46] <The_Game_Geek> yeah fair enough
[3:44:41] <%MelBrooksKA> @calaska140 The most disturbing thing I find about this is the pee is cool, why are you keeping chilled piss
[3:45:00] <calaska140> for guests
[3:45:02] <@SoFarFetched> either the glass is chilled
[3:45:06] <@SoFarFetched> or you put ice on it
[3:45:26] <%TheWinged7> @SoFarFetched or they put it in the fridge for a whiel
[3:45:29] <%MelBrooksKA> Or it's in a jug in the fridge
[3:45:41] <+MisterAvry> is cold piss worse than warm piss?
[3:45:45] <%afronooch> ice in veins, ice is my piss
[3:46:02] <The_Game_Geek> cold piss implies preparation of piss
[3:46:03] <%JoshManVGH> Cold piss... seems like a bad time.
[3:46:05] <+yourfriendtusks> rather have an ice cold piss tbh
[3:46:07] <The_Game_Geek> so i think thats worse
[3:46:08] <bakkatohri> How do you take cool piss anyway? Do you do it outside or something?
[3:46:20] <%afronooch> @MisterAvry depends on whose piss tbh
[3:46:20] <@SoFarFetched> hits the air and it freezes
[3:46:23] <retrosadness> id rather be served some ice cold piss than warm piss tbh
[3:46:35] <+yourfriendtusks> my lifestyle determines my piss style
[3:46:35] <%MelBrooksKA> @MisterAvry The idea that the piss has been produced, saved, and chilled is the worst part
[3:46:38] <%JoshManVGH> Though I wonder, the adage that bad beer tastes like piss, is that based on someone's unfortunate experience?
[3:46:53] <The_Game_Geek> probably more based on the smell of piss
[3:46:59] <bakkatohri> So it's like you're taking a freezing cold piss and you stab yourself with falling piss shards? That doesn't sound fun.
[3:47:13] <%MelBrooksKA> @MisterAvry It's basically the difference between 1st degree murder and manslaughter
[3:47:20] <%GalacticaPhanto> Is this only on PC at the moment?
[3:47:22] <+Ricky_Rexx> its time
[3:47:25] <Spagheddies> Walkies into boss.
[3:47:25] <+MisterAvry> hahaha

[3:47:49] <%TheWinged7> welcome back Pat, enjoy the cold glass of piss conversation
[3:47:50] <iswearimjustdandy> @misteravry cold things taste less strong so

[3:48:43] <+Ricky_Rexx> boss seems cool but what his hook

[3:48:57] <Zombrocom> Squirrel last
[3:49:02] <+itsgundamu> @Ricky_Rexx takes your last placed card
[3:49:04] <+MisterAvry> these card games always baffle the shit out of me. love the art style in this one tho
[3:49:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It becomes his
[3:49:19] <+Ricky_Rexx> @Ricky_Rexx no I know that I was making a hook pun
[3:49:20] <ergulor> he steals them
[3:49:21] <CoupleAGuys> He can keep that
[3:49:24] <+pectusumbra> so try to end on a squirrel
[3:49:27] <CoupleAGuys> Useless to him
[3:49:29] <%Nobody404> Giving him a squirrel basically sabotages him lmao
[3:49:31] <NeroInfinite> No he STOLE it
[3:49:33] <akitanito> helps block his shit if you have fodders I guess
[3:49:49] <%bevyrage> guess what pat

[3:53:36] <+Myopicvision91> so close
[3:53:40] <%Forbidden_Karp> Not the lit one!

[3:54:02] <Mazaari> the bell catching the smoke above the candles
[3:54:05] <%bevyrage> also it's too early for him to mess with the smoke from that
[3:54:08] <+nictron90> The candle smoke thing is a thing you do over multiple runs
[3:54:09] <LegitBarnacleBoy> he already did the clock chat, he's got the film
[3:54:13] <%bevyrage> he only blew out the candle once
[3:54:22] <calaska140> bone lord never pay cable bill
[3:54:23] <gslayer14> i did the smoke thing run 3
[3:54:24] <+nictron90> There's more to the clock @LegitBarnacleBoy
[3:54:27] <wqorst> why is the goat cute this time
[3:54:28] <RoosterSauces> Why is the goat all anime?
