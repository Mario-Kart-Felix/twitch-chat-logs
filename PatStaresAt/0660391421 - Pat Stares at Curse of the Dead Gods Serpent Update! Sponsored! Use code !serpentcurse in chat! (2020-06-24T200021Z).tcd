[0:14:15] <%MooseoneLivedhere> sounds like pokemon
[0:14:15] <%AlphaTauri> sounds like a pokemon game
[0:14:16] <karl_rex> THATS SO BAD
[0:14:20] <rekinom> Tencent licensed to make the MOBA, coincidentally, that was also the budget
[0:14:22] <+RhaskaFyraska> so it has the same animation quality as sword and shield
[0:14:25] <%Joustar_> If they're trying to get asian/chinese audiences more to pokemon, honestly in THAT sense it's not a shit move.
[0:14:27] <%WhereIsWill> farfetched for top lane!

[0:14:38] <%Typhaeon> I mean it SHOULD be ten cents Kappa
[0:14:41] <%Cthulos> It’s early
[0:14:42] <%Arazien> It is probably just to break Pokemon into China
[0:14:42] <%YakumoYomi> @Giggalith To be fair, Sword and Shield had sold 17 million copies by the end of March
[0:14:43] <%cvp5127> so its evil

[0:22:34] <%MooseoneLivedhere> SU fandom
[0:22:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> apparently the Druckhead issue being that he was a crunchlord wasn't true because everybody crunches.
[0:22:37] <%StaceMcGate> Hi everybody

[0:26:08] <%fingalights> Chat is hitting it out, that's just a demo

[0:26:25] <+NitronStreams> Free to start is just a more honest version of free to play
[0:26:30] <DragonArt07> @PatStaresAt Konami invented an even worse phrase, pay to save
[0:26:30] <%BoneofMalkav> A Demo you eventually have to pay to continue playing. My frustration towards this industry increases

[0:35:19] <transporterthesequel> For what it’s worth I’d go to Abby’s gunshow every goddamn day.
[0:35:21] <%corpsegoo> argueably when bots are your only audience is the ideal time to shout opinions into the void

[0:48:30] <%delilah4you> Thats kinda where I came into the Diablo thing

[0:48:35] <%VioletHeart> I mean you could always just load one of those guns with a pouch of shrapnel. It'd tear the gun to pieces after a couple of shots but it'd work.

[1:18:19] <+SlashHabit> compared sure, it's a game
[1:18:20] <+Verd_254> I heard someone comparing the reaction to TLoU2 to MGS2 and i wanted to vomit.

[1:18:51] <King_Wolf_Rigger> What's going on here?
[1:18:53] <%zettig> Death Stranding took banal package delivery and made it fun. TLOU2 took stealth gunplay and made it dull.
[1:18:57] <sonari38> oh god this seems really bad w/ the bow....
[1:18:57] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> Guts suffered way more than Ellie.
[1:19:03] <LoneFonte> BIG MONEY
[1:19:06] <%Mekhet09> Soap Opera's are better written though.

[1:19:44] <%depressed_skeleton> did you try calling elmo a baby?
[1:19:49] <%Mendin> TLoU2 is basically Naughty Dog looking at every game Yoko Taro has made, going, "Yeah we can do that better!" and completely missing the point
[1:19:51] <shinchanko> Elmo is upset about how shitty TLOU2 is
[1:19:55] <SpookyBeef7> Hmm, might have to look into this game later.

[1:21:19] <%Mendin> Bruh you just shot cringe
[1:21:21] <+RhaskaFyraska> @WhereIsWill Because cosmic horror is hard to put nto any medium outside of the written/spoken word
[1:21:23] <faintsmile> could they not have given this dude another grunt aside from 'bruh'
[1:21:32] <usurper_sos> It sounds like you are saying Bruh every time you shoot

[1:23:08] <+RhaskaFyraska> @WhereIsWill If you mean mechanically i dunno, big studios probably dont see potential in cosmic horror, aklthough that one game Control touches on that sort of stuff and it looks great
[1:23:17] <@SoFarFetched> It's 15 bucks currently,since it's still Early Access. So the Price will probably go up once it's fully released.
[1:23:19] <%ConLin_Arts_> BRUH
[1:23:19] <%Typhaeon> Seems pretty much a cakewalk
[1:23:26] <rekinom> It sounds like your character is saying "Bruh" every time he fires
[1:23:29] <%Starotter70> @dapperskeleton69 On steam it's normally 15$, the other releases probably aren't that different
[1:23:32] <%Mrbaconator> oh my god it is bruh

[1:46:44] <%WhereIsWill> emlo the true shill
[1:46:53] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> The dark souls SpongeBob game should take place in Rock Bottom, with the Glove hats as helmets
[1:46:56] <%Metballs> His best sucks
[1:47:01] <dapperskeleton69> elmo is comuning with the past avatars before him
[1:47:01] <KaliasTV> Elmo the centipede spotter has logged on
[1:47:02] <%heartlesshealer> psaWhat psaGib LuvSnooze
[1:47:04] <domgoesnowhere> it must be those 5g towers
[1:47:11] <$Dakuu75> The aliens can't control your thoughts, if you don't have any.
[1:47:18] <domgoesnowhere> turning cat brains to poo
[1:47:26] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> He's just taking after his dad

[1:48:04] <dapperskeleton69> "ah, you were by my side all along, my old friend" says spongebob as he draws his moonlight spatula
[1:48:11] <%heartlesshealer> the primary use of the Shield is to defend
[1:48:19] <cookieclickerfad> GUN
[1:48:25] <Daveythe6thMoon> A Spongebob Dark Souls game would need to have Smitty WerbenJagerManJensen be the final boss.
[1:48:33] <+Kindan55> Is pat gonna finish Obra Din?
[1:48:34] <Daveythe6thMoon> Cause he was Number One!
[1:48:36] <Ner234> @dapperskeleton69 You almost made me choe on my foodd LUL
[1:48:47] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> Duh. He was number one
[1:48:55] <domgoesnowhere> game ends with spongebob turning to a snail
[1:48:57] <dapperskeleton69> *another one chokes on the dust*
[1:49:00] <%heartlesshealer> He'll probably finish Obra Dinn some other time. He's on scheduled stuff for now
[1:49:11] <+ChestMimik> "Does this look dangerous to you" Lord Gwyn relighting the first flame

[1:49:19] <%Sol_Install> A LOT
[1:49:19] <%Starotter70> I'm a big fan of Spongeborne
[1:49:22] <cookieclickerfad> betting he's gonna die on a trap
[1:49:26] <%DappercatEsquire> nailed it
[1:49:27] <KoyaMusa> so big give up?
[1:49:27] <%WhereIsWill> maximum enjoyment
[1:49:30] <%Jekado> I would
[1:49:33] <cookieclickerfad> dammit
[1:49:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat it wont take long. about 2 hours
[1:49:41] <%heartlesshealer> We'll be here for possible Elmo
[1:49:42] <%D00msDayDan> pat do you forget why pat stares at caught on as a thing to say?
[1:49:43] <%Mendin> Pat you havent learned the full plot yet so
[1:49:43] <%Jekado> I would watch Paige definately to play Obra Dinn
[1:49:45] <%Agami23> chat was abysmal during obra din. love the game but damn
[1:49:48] <%heartlesshealer> You know we will
[1:49:49] <$Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt Did you enjoy Ori?
[1:49:59] <%pi_in_the_sci> That's probably worth recording and editing down, but not as worth doing on stream
[1:50:02] <Daveythe6thMoon> I'm gonna hazard a guess and say that Pat's done with Ellie's fantastic revenge quest across America.
[1:50:10] <chhdez> !serpentcurse
[1:50:10] <@Moobot> Check out Curse of the Dead Gods and its latest update here: https://bit.ly/3ep3yaa Sponsored by Focus Home Interactive!
[1:50:13] <domgoesnowhere> has pat completely abandoned tlou2?
[1:50:13] <$Dakuu75> cool, I wanted to watch him finish Ori. I still haven't beat it myself
[1:50:17] <+kknutson4> Did you see Hades was just upated?
[1:50:25] <BinaryBetrayer> Most people are done with it.
[1:50:32] <%heartlesshealer> yay Ori
[1:50:32] <+PenmanLupine> not much of a guess he's confirmed it multiple times in multiple streams, twitter and the podcast
[1:50:36] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Pat's changing the Gungeon stream to Hades I believe. SInce he didn't know it updated.
[1:50:37] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> One of the bosses has to be Bubble Bass. Just a giant Bubble Bass head with pickles nailed to the roof of his mouth as he tries to bite you in half
[1:50:41] <%Terrah48> 100% bought Obra Dinn because he didnt finish it so maybe it's for the best
[1:50:51] <%Dreadlord134> I heard ori makes people cry, has pat ever cried in stream?
[1:50:56] <Ner234> In other words, be good
[1:51:16] <+PenmanLupine> I want Krabby Patty thighs Squirdward to be a boss
[1:51:21] <%heartlesshealer> Pat held Elmo for emotional support and dodged crying
[1:51:45] <%Starotter70> If there was a DMC Spongebob game would Doodlebob be the Vergil?
[1:51:46] <@SoFarFetched> Honestly might be best if Pat didn't finish Obra Dinn on stream,since people would probably start blurting answers because they feel he's taking too long or not figuring it out.
[1:51:57] <jeffishype> HE HATES IT! KUYASHI
[1:52:08] <dabeaminator> Just got here from Woolie's Halo stream. Never saw that one coming.
[1:52:10] <$Dakuu75> @Dreadlord134 I think he got close to crying during some of the sad parts of the FF7 remake but, that's all I remember
[1:52:11] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> Larry the Lobster is just Ingward
[1:52:12] <BinaryBetrayer> Yeah, that game is probably left to explore outside the stream.
[1:52:24] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> Or Solaire
[1:52:28] <Daveythe6thMoon> He doesn't like it in a box, he doesn't like it with a fox. He doesn't like this horrid mess, he doesn't like much like the rest.
[1:52:31] <%zeroarturia> Not on stream but he did cry in the Walking Dead Season 1 LP
[1:52:33] <%xxmagonx> psaCrazyhead
[1:52:35] <%pectusumbra> Off

[1:54:11] <+ChestMimik> The flow of time is convoluted in Bikini Bottom
[1:54:17] <%DappercatEsquire> the juice is loose and it's beating your ass
[1:54:21] <person181> drink the juice then
[1:54:32] <chll0ne> psaBlind
[1:54:37] <garrulousAuthority> the issue is now I'm going to have to compare this game with Hades, and I'm not sure that's fair
[1:54:41] <dapperskeleton69> Drink the koolaid pat!
[1:55:12] <SomeOtherNeb> has Pat reacted to that Hard Times article about him losing 400 subscribers because he took an extra long shit
[1:55:12] <%DappercatEsquire> This seems like a more compact experience than Hades
[1:55:17] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> Hades is so good already
[1:55:21] <$Dakuu75> I never got the trope of sacrificing blood via slicing the palm of your hand. that seems like one of the WORST spots to get cut
[1:55:21] <dabeaminator> I thought you were taking this week off
[1:55:36] <@SSaryn> Should mention Hades is going into 1.0 later this year as well.
[1:55:45] <BinaryBetrayer> I'd compare this game to Gauntlet, and the random buff/debuffs are like the endgame maps of Torchlight 2.
[1:55:47] <%Daxalog> Whats more taking week off then being sponsored?
[1:55:53] <garrulousAuthority> I can't fucking wait for 1.0
[1:55:58] <%pectusumbra> These kind of sample weeks are nice though
[1:56:00] <ballpatter> yummy money
[1:56:05] <%heartlesshealer> okay
[1:56:15] <%Agami23> quick game devs. keep making him do sponsors so he cant get a break
[1:56:23] <%heartlesshealer> yeah it's nice
[1:56:25] <BinaryBetrayer> Variety is the spice of life.
[1:56:27] <ToneBacas> makes sense
[1:56:30] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt Did you like that new Deadly Premonition 2 trailer?
[1:56:33] <SomeOtherNeb> I'm so in for more Deadly Premonition
[1:56:35] <@SoFarFetched> Variety is always good.
[1:56:36] <+ghostfaceninja_> deadly pee
[1:56:37] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt are you going to stream the rest of Ori since it's short?
[1:56:37] <dabeaminator> Oh god you're gonna stream all of DP2?
[1:56:39] <%BestTeaMaker> deadly pee? you might wanna see a doctor for that
[1:56:41] <%heartlesshealer> god I hope the whistling song is brought back
[1:56:43] <ToneBacas> cool games pop up, variety dies. i'm ok with it
[1:56:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DP?
[1:56:46] <@SoFarFetched> @zamzoph Yeah he's planning to finish it.
[1:56:47] <Saltmeisterr> Deadly Piss
[1:56:54] <@SSaryn> Hah. DP.
[1:56:54] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> Pat needs a vacation from his vacation.
[1:56:57] <@SSaryn> Kappa
[1:56:59] <zamzoph> @SoFarFetched yay
[1:57:05] <domgoesnowhere> yeye deadly pee
[1:57:10] <garrulousAuthority> those are chonky swings
[1:57:12] <%DappercatEsquire> Has there been any mention of combat in DP2?
[1:57:19] <%BestTeaMaker> noooo not the snek
[1:57:24] <@SoFarFetched> And Pat suddenly sees "FK" in his coffee cup one day.
[1:57:58] <%Treuan> More like FK BOI
[1:57:58] <thelonechris> Pat will finally confront his nemesis, Quint
[1:58:10] <chhdez> QUINT!
[1:58:13] <%heartlesshealer> and then he finds out that he can indeed climb underneath the covers of his bed
[1:58:13] <%DappercatEsquire> I'd be totally okay with DP2 having no combat and just being an investigation game
[1:58:20] <BinaryBetrayer> Dat life
[1:58:25] <%Starotter70> Fucking Quint
[1:58:33] <chhdez> With his Float-outside-his-car tech
[1:58:36] <%DappercatEsquire> Well, investigation/Tony Hawk game
[1:58:39] <garrulousAuthority> DP except it plays like Disco Elysium?
[1:58:40] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> I am hoping the new Deadly Premonition lives up to the original, though.
[1:58:51] <cookieclickerfad> what do the stats on the bottom right do?
[1:58:52] <%YakumoYomi> Pat's not ready for Quint; he hasn't done enough off-screen grinding.
[1:58:53] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> Also, isn't it Switch exclusive?
[1:58:58] <usurper_sos> you are going in on perception
[1:58:59] <%StaceMcGate> the worse one
[1:59:00] <cookieclickerfad> bottom left*
[1:59:01] <%DappercatEsquire> Man I hope York can do a kick flip
[1:59:02] <%optimasmaximas> tf did i just walk into
[1:59:04] <%Treuan> YOOO
[1:59:04] <%Retinolgaming> Retinolgaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Pat, did you see the new pokemon game that got announced? I don't understand how the most valuable IP in media can be this poorly run.
[1:59:06] <Mister_McDerp> mpreg
[1:59:07] <person181> pat is pergante
[1:59:08] <%optimasmaximas> pat being impregnated?

[1:59:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> But it uses Orbs Woolie.
[1:59:26] <%weissguard> Elmo's a DAD?
[1:59:26] <%Undenizen> I have never seen this! what is THIS!
[1:59:29] <%YakumoYomi> @optimasmaximas Gold Impregnation, apparently
[1:59:30] <%heartlesshealer> cash kid
[1:59:30] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> Disco Elysium is the only game to come out in 20 years that rivals Planescape Torment. So. Fucking. Good.
[2:00:01] <%optimasmaximas> @YakumoYomi tf is gold impregnation? does the O R B birth gold coins now?
[2:00:01] <ballpatter> Pokemon league of legends looks like hot poo
[2:00:19] <garrulousAuthority> @BinaryBetrayer toss in "tanned skin" and you got yourself a stew going

[2:00:43] <Aydarkzero> friendship ended w/ tlou2 now pokemon is what i'll laugh at Kappa
[2:00:43] <%YakumoYomi> @optimasmaximas Pat has been cursed with gold impregnation. I blame Plague.
[2:00:43] <AbnormalEnd> and that says a lot
[2:00:45] <%optimasmaximas> NO PAT
[2:00:46] <SomeOtherNeb> don't do it Pat

[2:00:49] <%heartlesshealer> SO IT'S WORKING?
[2:00:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Don't do it.
[2:00:51] <%Valdorick> Don't do it Pat! You'll hate it!
[2:00:52] <%azure22900> Yeah, but don't
[2:00:54] <%DappercatEsquire> BECOME TOXIC
[2:00:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is going to be Destiny 2 all over again Pat, don't do it.
[2:00:58] <%Chichen> pat dont fall for MARKETING
[2:00:59] <%notgarza> Is that pokemon game for mobile?
[2:00:59] <%Agami23> oh god i decided to check my twitter and my local beach is trending oh god
[2:01:01] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> Loot crates should just go flying every time you get hit
[2:01:09] <%Daxalog> But?
[2:01:12] <%heartlesshealer> finding clap emoji for that
[2:01:12] <%Starotter70> But time IS money
[2:01:16] <$Dakuu75> yeah because ppl just gifted you shit, lol
[2:01:16] <Aydarkzero> @notgarza mobile and switch crossplay
[2:01:18] <%optimasmaximas> @Agami23 for what lol?
[2:01:19] <%Arazien> Yes. Keep feeding RIOT, bastions of purity, your time and influence
[2:01:20] <@SSaryn> I only got back into SMITE cause I remembered how much League was prevalent again due to Runeterra
[2:01:23] <%Retinolgaming> @PatStaresAt Did you learn from Overwatch lootbox?
[2:01:24] <BinaryBetrayer> Another lootbox stream but with League.
[2:01:38] <SomeOtherNeb> this game is HARD though
[2:01:39] <%heartlesshealer> getting out of League after spending $0 on it 👏👏
[2:01:40] <garrulousAuthority> Pat how does it feel to know you're a decade too old to go pro in League
[2:01:43] <Aydarkzero> watch Shiny Pokemon be Skins LUL
[2:01:44] <%Pyroclase> Hi I'm here now, how goes the cursing
[2:01:48] <%DappercatEsquire> you're too short to do a medium
[2:01:49] <%YakumoYomi> BORF!
[2:01:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yeah cause Peach would strangle you by the testicles if you repeated the Warframe incident again.
[2:01:56] <%Agami23> @optimasmaximas basically they confirmed at least 18 people who went there with covid when it was reopened and packed with people.
[2:01:57] <StrawberryBandit> and that's how my story ends
[2:02:09] <filialpails> don't stand in the (line of) fire
[2:02:16] <%heartlesshealer> I don't want that timeline
[2:02:19] <BinaryBetrayer> I was a betatester for Smite and another thing called Heroes of Newerth, but I never got into the Mobas, To this day I hate them with passion.
[2:02:20] <%Undenizen> my bf goes through like phases where he'll forget literally everything in his life to play LoL.
[2:02:22] <%optimasmaximas> @Agami23 florida i presume lol?
[2:02:26] <%YakumoYomi> @garrulousAuthority I feel attacked (because I'm older than Pat)
[2:02:26] <%D00msDayDan> a very different PATh
[2:02:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> So we'd get Pat without any of the character development, got it, I hate it.
[2:02:37] <TheHeroAppears> the strange young pat timeline
[2:02:39] <%Haruo30> That timeline sounds like garbage

[2:02:59] <%CJett92> Palter
[2:02:59] <%Arazien> The Riot brand of toxicity is just the right kind for Pat
[2:03:03] <%ShootThatZombie> hullo hullo today
[2:03:04] <@SSaryn> Was it about how she wants to MPREG you with Gold Skeletons?
[2:03:07] <%Chichen> your own phone scared you?
[2:03:08] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> You'd be a fiend, but not a pro.
[2:03:11] <domgoesnowhere> pat 2nd gig. just league
[2:03:23] <%optimasmaximas> @Agami23 welp, sucks anyway, people be stupid

[2:03:36] <%DappercatEsquire> wepon
[2:03:36] <%azure22900> Imagine League during the COD MW2 era.
[2:03:43] <DidacticTactic> pat is going to become a pokemon unite pro
[2:03:46] <%spongeofmystery> Pat is like Geralt, he's got to have enough potion buffs to perform well but not too much toxicity that he straight up dies
[2:03:47] <BinaryBetrayer> God
[2:03:51] <%weissguard> Was Smite good? I might have played it about 6? years ago. I don't remember.
[2:03:51] <%jowi_time> Young Pat comes out of a portal, Old Pat : Why are you here?. Young Pat: To reclaim my future!
[2:03:54] <%optimasmaximas> oh boy LUL
[2:03:57] <%heartlesshealer> oh god
[2:03:58] <%Agami23> @optimasmaximas thats the plan.
[2:04:01] <+Remery_> League is 10 years old
[2:04:02] <%Arazien> League durng MW was just DOTA
[2:04:03] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> @azure22900 That existed. It was called Dota.
[2:04:05] <%dekkitout> That would've been glorious
[2:04:09] <garrulousAuthority> Into the Pat-verse
[2:04:10] <%Starotter70> Delicious
[2:04:11] <domgoesnowhere> retired from Dota 2. can never get back into mobas
[2:04:14] <+jiggy_snipe> League came out i like 09 or 2010
[2:04:25] <%blankwaffle> it was around then?
[2:04:34] <%DappercatEsquire> I just can't devote that much time to end up feeling like shit at the end
[2:04:36] <%azure22900> Dota was too niche and hard for most players
[2:04:45] <%Haruo30> LoL came out a month before MW2
[2:04:48] <Aydarkzero> that's cool
[2:04:51] <%Afterman_> dotas fuckin great tho
[2:04:54] <%heartlesshealer> makes sense
[2:05:00] <BinaryBetrayer> Eh
[2:05:02] <%blankwaffle> im pretty sure veigar has a skin from the winnepeg olympics
[2:05:08] <%Haruo30> LoL was in October MW2 November
[2:05:10] <%blankwaffle> i mean whistler
[2:05:12] <domgoesnowhere> Dota 1 was super popular when I was in hs
[2:05:15] <%blankwaffle> whereveer it was
[2:05:23] <%heartlesshealer> hmm
[2:05:25] <ShadeNightz> talon
[2:05:25] <BinaryBetrayer> Spears
[2:05:28] <%cowardlord> spear
[2:05:28] <%pectusumbra> there are whistler skins yeah, really rare
[2:05:31] <%weissguard> Spear sounds cool.
[2:05:33] <%xxmagonx> Talon
[2:05:35] <%heartlesshealer> I don't know enough to know how useful the passives are
[2:05:38] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> @domgoesnowhere Quitting was the right call. You now have to spend money to be on equal footing with in-game information as other players, as well as hideously garish cosmetics for money taking over the entire game.
[2:05:50] <domgoesnowhere> never experienced more toxicity then when I was playing mobas
[2:05:54] <StrawberryBandit> spear is sick
[2:06:05] <%azure22900> Yeah but LoL was a nothing game during the first couple of years.
[2:06:13] <%blankwaffle> oh man early league was soooo toxic
[2:06:20] <garrulousAuthority> but does this game have the power of G U N
[2:06:25] <Hydrapissed> any pvp game is gana be toxic
[2:06:26] <BinaryBetrayer> Mobas are the toxicity distiller
[2:06:26] <$Dakuu75> literal boss-fountain?
[2:06:29] <%Haruo30> Yeah it was nothing

[2:08:15] <$CharlesRobinJr> is it bad that this reminds me of hades
[2:08:17] <Saltmeisterr> they defintely made the combat in this game feel good
[2:08:27] <Hydrapissed> what about wizard of legend
[2:08:27] <BinaryBetrayer> I've always been curious about Demigod because of the thing in the game cover, but at the same time it's old as fuck. Anyone knows anything about Demigod?
[2:08:30] <Hydrapissed> that game was dope
[2:08:31] <+bravedjohnny> play monster train instead
[2:08:34] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt what about Monster Train?
[2:08:34] <+CarcerDun> hey folks
[2:08:34] <%Pyroclase> I've never enjoyed deck-builders myself, I just... don't feel right playing card games
[2:08:35] <jeffishype> what about monster train?
[2:08:37] <%heartlesshealer> It's fun, so at least keep it in your mind if you ever get bored

[2:08:41] <%azure22900> Oh new gamemode coming this friday for LoR at least.
[2:08:46] <%Starotter70> What the fuck is Arknights, and why does it have a penguin with sunglasses!?
[2:08:48] <%DappercatEsquire> @Hydrapissed The unoffical Avatar game
[2:08:52] <%AgniBrandt> Any plans to try West of Dead?
[2:08:53] <%BestTeaMaker> what even is gauntlet mode?
[2:08:57] <+Remery_> Just waiting for the Vastaya region in Runeterra to play Xayah/Rakan and Sett.
[2:09:08] <+CarcerDun> sounds design is really nice
[2:09:09] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> Demigod was a game way before it's time. Super fun game, no longer many private servers to experience it on.
[2:09:10] <%azure22900> Tavern Brawl but lasts longer i think
[2:09:12] <Hydrapissed> @DappercatEsquire legally distinct h20 bending
[2:09:37] <BinaryBetrayer> I thought so. Old mobas, specially proto mobas, are super dead.

[2:11:27] <%DappercatEsquire> @KingVantq I played it. Slightly in the weeds, movement speed is slow as shit and makes every match feel like a slog. There's an unpolished quality to it that permeates the entire game and makes it feel kinda shoddy.

[2:18:43] <penitentpentwitch> And now I have the itch... Time to play Hades!
[2:18:45] <King_Wolf_Rigger> It has nothing to do with Woolie
[2:19:20] <%emperordread> Pat, is this game better or worse than hades? They seem very similar and I've not played either
[2:19:21] <%FacetiousAF> woolie is a saint, he's an angel, he might as well be wearing a...... Halo
[2:19:25] <usurper_sos> Woolie ended his stream recently I guess

[2:23:58] <penitentpentwitch> Oh, it's the 'crit bonus' damage that you heal. Not the entirety of the damage AND the crit bonus.
[2:24:09] <Bearheart223> That's not a combo what you're doing, thats just an offhand attack
[2:24:18] <%bluefooddye1> Combos Pat, you have to use it AFTER using another weapon

[2:36:00] <%notgarza> The dank weed
[2:36:00] <$Dakuu75> because he get's a lot of donations to be chill
[2:36:01] <%CursedNobleman> paige sucks all of the rage out of him
[2:36:02] <%FacetiousAF> he's chill because he gets all the rage out when it shows up
[2:36:02] <%Agami23> the fact that you used to be known as angriestpat is really funny.
[2:36:03] <%bluefooddye1> He gets laid
