[0:15:10] <ArjenDesign> @AngriestPat Never played/finished this game before? Or just playing for the DLC?
[0:15:12] <+Dimfish> your mortgage is only 6 years?
[0:15:12] <%Ilpala> what will you eat and buy video games with?

[0:15:16] <Megapikman132> YEP
[0:15:17] <Deadbulky> Nope
[0:15:17] <+SolverCODO> Foreplay?
[0:15:18] <%Beough> @AngriestPat what's your version of pbs, or like a channel that would play mister rogers or sesame street, so like what is canadian pbs?
[0:15:18] <AMajorTom> Does Canada not have property taxes?
[0:15:20] <%AkronymCLT> sounds like the good life
[0:15:21] <aimlesshealer> E3 is nothing but disappointment nowadays
[0:15:22] <jujuschlempermo> what
[0:15:22] <JJnAJjohnson> It was tho
[0:15:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> I'm more enjoying Epic BURN
[0:15:24] <Ion_Laser> The LA Convention Center is going to be empty in June
[0:15:25] <%laserbeaming> Foreplan?
[0:15:26] <%Solidnick18> E2
[0:15:26] <%valriot> E3 is balls
[0:15:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> get fired for giving an honest review of a game?
[0:15:28] <+tigerfang86> Pat's actually a boomer fuckin fuck
[0:15:29] <@Mechz71> poomer
[0:15:29] <%Laecerelius> At least we'll get some sweet, sweet Devolver stuff
[0:15:29] <DracaenaLeaf> but You will get sucked!
[0:15:30] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It's always better back in the day when we were kids. Text games where truly the golden age.
[0:15:32] <%stagemage> the floorplane
[0:15:32] <+Viridiant> What's the issue with this year's E3, I'm not in the know
[0:15:33] <%GohanEgret> meh, I prefer this timeline where we can get new shit all year long
[0:15:35] <+masked_hero_lucky> I blame Epic Games.
[0:15:37] <ArjenDesign> Nice. :D I look forward to hearing your thoughts
[0:15:38] <%TombstoneTTromboners> it's true
[0:15:39] <Novillion> I swear every character I see in this game is the cutest ever it's insane
[0:15:41] <%Dementedpenguin> I've heard of the game. And I'm aware it has hats. That's basically it.
[0:15:43] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat still need to buy food after ya mortgage tho
[0:15:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> gerstman got fired for having morals.
[0:15:49] <@Fuggins4U> I want to be rich and live in a food truck.
[0:15:50] <clempstwitch> You're gonna have a great time with it, Hat in Time is a joy
[0:15:51] <turqrazor> iis a hat in time better than mario odyssey?
[0:15:53] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @AngriestPat Will you stream watching E3 for kicks?
[0:15:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Novillion its to cute
[0:15:55] <+DukeMoose> just buy the house completely in Bits
[0:15:59] <Tucker0603> fuck you man, look at property tax here in NH
[0:16:00] <+mercado94> hi clemps
[0:16:04] <MarylandJutsu> so the actor who plays ron weasley @Fuggins4U
[0:16:04] <%valriot> I just wanna see game announcements and i hate shit is held off for entire years cos "Uhduss E3 3Head"
[0:16:08] <+Dimfish> @turqrazor no but its a close second
[0:16:14] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> I predict the specifics of how the walljumping works will frustrate pat.
[0:16:17] <+ChaosVulpes> The only thing about E3 I look forward to, is what new character Nintendo will reveal for SMASH
[0:16:17] <redlight55> cant wait for the sanic hat mods
[0:16:22] <Johno_san> congrats!!
[0:16:24] <%GabeSweetMan> I hope they revisit Armored Core.

[0:21:26] <damienlunas> But paaaat you were gonna play it in your off time anyway, just put a camera in front of you! It's the same, right?
[0:21:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> All the time...then I wake up and call in because that nightmare fucking sucks.

[0:21:38] <%ThatOneGameTester> Plus the commentary gets dated as shit, even more than usual.
[0:21:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> I understand the idea behind it is that you could release it later when the embargo is lifted and thus monitize it...but yeah its stupid
[0:21:41] <aimlesshealer> LUL
[0:21:42] <+peri_d0t> maybe if it wasn't persona 5 that could be a valid idea

[0:22:03] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Do it for the LOVE OF THE GAME!
[0:22:04] <$valriot> Persona 5 wouldve been LP poison anyway, especially with Woolies "pause, lemme think about this one line for 10 minutes"
[0:22:05] <JazzyJulZ> Yeah it's just a persona, Pat's actually super cool
[0:22:05] <+UberWolfman> MMMMM MEEEEEE!!!!

[0:34:10] <%TombstoneTTromboners> you gotta get the niche community shit

[0:34:12] <%Totally_not_toby> or you could play old gamecube games for NO ONE
[0:34:13] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Choose NICHE GAMES

[0:35:21] <OkamiDude15> stream the first ever dong dong never die tournament
[0:35:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> as pat demonstrates, you have to be a bizarre troll man and have a hot girlfriend who has an obscure illness
[0:35:24] <%GabeSweetMan> I'm still not over THE DARK ONE betraying his wife and fanbase. I was a fan of his since before ScrewAttack. Shit sucks.
[0:35:24] <BunnyEmperor> We built this empire on shitty games LUL
[0:35:26] <dsauce999> RIP LobosJr
[0:35:26] <%Verd_254> ENB got it the worst
[0:35:30] <starotter70> Oh yeah
[0:35:30] <%TombstoneTTromboners> remember the poor minecrafter youtubers
[0:35:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> they became defined by dark souls
[0:35:33] <%snow_bush> Do you think about DSP?
[0:35:34] <%Totally_not_toby> ugh that's annoying
[0:35:35] <MarylandJutsu> oh snap
[0:35:35] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat pat thinks about Plague ocasionaly
[0:35:41] <b_ikki> yeah ENB nuked his channel because of that
[0:35:41] <Johno_san> they fukin bust a nut
[0:35:45] <%laserbeaming> Plague is now locked into the Softcore Furry cage Kappa
[0:35:46] <GoldeNOVA> Plague's IHNM LP was rad
[0:35:46] <Kingtut9009> Peeve and Oroboros had to deal with that too @AngriestPat
[0:35:48] <Johno_san> and not in a goood way
[0:35:49] <%THATGUY_789> Book Play the shit I came here for slave
[0:35:52] <aimlesshealer> You have to have enough charisma to make the content about YOU, not the game
[0:35:52] <RupanSen> It mostly happen ti ENB to be fair
[0:35:57] <shackbox> Shit their pants so hard when there's no Bandai Namco on screen
[0:35:58] <eanscrale> What about if you can draw?
[0:35:58] <BunnyEmperor> Yeah dude Minecraft youtubers are fucking suffering playing the same shit everyday
[0:36:02] <%THATGUY_789> I hate autocorrect
[0:36:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> Do something the audience likes...do something you like
[0:36:08] <%GohanEgret> oh man,so I CANT make a channel dedicated to ZOE2 and get a billion subs? BibleThump
[0:36:11] <%Laecerelius> Spy does old RPGs which are fun to watch
[0:36:15] <voyagerwitch> ive been happy with quiteshallow's audience being receptive to her branching out from warframe
[0:36:20] <ArjenDesign> The balancing act between being consistent and varied is a tough one.
[0:36:20] <crunkers_> What up Pat and cat!
[0:36:22] <Klefth> ENB doesn't even like doing lore stuff, yet people STILL bug him about dark souls lore to this day
[0:36:26] <%Verd_254> Crazy thing is ENB did do that, his LP's of Tactics and Vagrant Story were some of my favorite videos. It just never caught on.
[0:36:29] <aimlesshealer> Like I could watch Pat play with toothpicks on a table and it'd be fun
[0:36:31] <dsauce999> Dank Souls 3
[0:36:33] <ghostofsolomon> thanks for the response pat! apprecaite it!
[0:36:34] <%Laecerelius> Shy always finds the best bugs to record
[0:36:36] <%Kataguro> Well that worked out
[0:36:36] <%GabeSweetMan> ENB introduced me to Vagrant Story but he stopped playing because everyone was screaming at him about how it wasn't Dark Souls. I was so upset that his attempts to share that game got shut down.
[0:36:37] <starotter70> Yeah
[0:36:40] <r_Foeburden87> No Seikiro ?
[0:36:42] <+tigerfang86> well that worked
[0:36:44] <Atoris_Aether> Reminds me of ZeRo when he branched out of Smash and into Persona
[0:36:44] <televisedrevolting> Really?
[0:36:44] <kingra> I remember that.
[0:36:44] <RantingRavager> BibleThump
[0:36:45] <reiju_22> then you did dark souls 1
[0:36:47] <+miguelrod777> tarkus will always be hype
[0:36:49] <voyagerwitch> the response to the dark souls 3 lp was extremely toxic
[0:36:53] <@SSaryn> A lot of it was just not ok.
[0:36:55] <DraxTD> @r_Foeburden87 nope
[0:36:59] <CommanderCOOL> you became the yakuza guy instead hehe
[0:37:05] <%laserbeaming> Oh yeah, I remember that
[0:37:09] <%Totally_not_toby> people were so weird about that game
[0:37:11] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@dsauce999) (warning)
[0:37:12] <thelonechris> Reeeeee
[0:37:15] <Psykoknight65> so no code vein?
[0:37:15] <%TombstoneTTromboners> correct
[0:37:16] <%NobleJedi> true
[0:37:17] <kingra> Yeah
[0:37:17] <starotter70> I mean
[0:37:19] <dsauce999> REEEEE
[0:37:19] <$nademonkey1100> yes we are
[0:37:19] <+Dimfish> yes
[0:37:21] <%GabeSweetMan> People had contradicting expectations.
[0:37:21] <+tigerfang86> we are
[0:37:23] <TheCrook92> cirREE play it right cirREE
[0:37:23] <%laserbeaming> We are indeed assholes
[0:37:24] <shackbox> Something about DS makes people super great in game and toxic af outside it
[0:37:26] <+TQuick101> pot calling the kettle
[0:37:29] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Woolie was the chosen undead, not Pat
[0:37:31] <%NovaKnightmare> I can feel that
[0:37:36] <kingra> Fucking oof
[0:37:44] <voyagerwitch> it made me super uncomfortable to see people just complaining and only complaining in the comments
[0:37:45] <+SaltySombrero> Girls were watching
[0:37:45] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[0:37:46] <%CJett92> You missed a chest 3 hours ago, it only had souls bjt GO GET IT YOU NOOB
[0:37:47] <starotter70> ah
[0:37:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> snail souls?
[0:37:49] <reiju_22> is it better when streaming it?
[0:37:51] <%GabeSweetMan> The concept of "snails-souls" nonsense is the DUMBEST.
[0:37:53] <MarylandJutsu> Screws with your MIIND
[0:37:54] <aimlesshealer> That's rough
[0:37:55] <%Dovahthing> the pressure, that's rough
[0:37:56] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat "drop yo shield"
[0:38:02] <%GabeSweetMan> I take fucking 3 times longer to beat those games.
[0:38:03] <shackbox> do whatever in a stream
[0:38:04] <dsauce999> Play Games the Way I Want!!!! SwiftRage
[0:38:06] <%logoth_> That is an *ALLLIIIIIEEEEEENNNNNNNN*
[0:38:07] <shackbox> we'll yell at you live
[0:38:07] <Them00n> Pat seems to prefer doing live media across the board.
[0:38:09] <%TombstoneTTromboners> ahahaha
[0:38:13] <reonome> dumb bitch you missed chest
[0:38:14] <+tigerfang86> lmao
[0:38:14] <crunkers_> Yeah it does get pretty "back seat gaming"
[0:38:15] <%Verd_254> Then you ignore it out of spite
[0:38:15] <turretgunz> people reacting that way was why Matt stopped wanting to LP.
[0:38:17] <+Grayhammatter> missed CHEST
[0:38:18] <%Totally_not_toby> thassa aaaaaaaaaaaalieeeeeeeen
[0:38:19] <$nademonkey1100> you miss chest in everything
[0:38:20] <%laserbeaming> So that's why you did the DLCs on stream I guess
[0:38:21] <$HentaiSenpai9K> LUL
[0:38:21] <ArjenDesign> It's frustrating how fans with a lot of prior experience set expectations for you; you ought to have the chance to make mistakes and learn.
[0:38:25] <%GabeSweetMan> #blind
[0:38:25] <+Dimfish> amazing chest ahead
[0:38:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> Amazing Chest ahead
[0:38:26] <%Kataguro> They're the same thing...but they're caster versions...
[0:38:27] <%Dementedpenguin> "No, do it PERFECT. Do LP. SwftRage "
[0:38:31] <jimmytwofeet> @AngriestPat Hi pookie
[0:38:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer500 If you play things that are more niche or obscure, you can scoop up a small passionate audience. A dozen low-subscriber youtubers got views out of me just because they played through Asura's Wrath, and I even stuck with one of them.
[0:38:33] <qo_op> goblins
[0:38:34] <Khorneflakes_> And the chest was still missing to this very day
[0:38:35] <flubber3d> okay i'm back. glad i didn't miss anything
[0:38:35] <DracaenaLeaf> Hollow Knight 8 hours
[0:38:36] <+Eclipse_knight_> then b.v someone fucks up your quest @angriespat
[0:38:39] <%Rngiddion> that 10 hour DS3 stream
[0:38:40] <hntronium> Dumb bitch you miss chest
[0:38:40] <+Dimfish> @doc_ock_rokc youre a good man
[0:38:41] <%Dementedpenguin> I butchered that goddamn quote LUL
[0:38:41] <deity_majora> Pat likes Dark Souls too much... it made him a really bad choice to be main player
[0:38:43] <gayyyymoutain303> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
[0:38:44] <%korth367> you fucking IN on hallowknight
[0:38:44] <MarylandJutsu> BIG HOLLOW KNIGHT
[0:38:44] <%Sabre_Basilisk> try finger but whole
[0:38:48] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Hollow Knight was fucking awesome.
[0:38:49] <starotter70> Been playing that recently, it's great
[0:38:49] <%PROUD2beGINGER> That was a trip
[0:38:50] <%Laecerelius> open world games are much better to stream since you can use the stretches of downtime to talk to chat and whatnot
[0:38:51] <%GabeSweetMan> The most infuriating though is people getting mad at you for missing HIDDEN CONTENT. It's HIDDEN YOU FUCKS.
[0:38:51] <%TombstoneTTromboners> NINE HOURS
[0:38:52] <$valriot> Hollow Knight is fuckin rad

[0:39:30] <televisedrevolting> Yeah, I remember going to sleep then waking up to that stream.
[0:39:30] <+Dimfish> hollow knights one of those games that just makes time disappear
[0:39:31] <%skizzuto> honestly I regret staying up for that whole stream, but Hollow Knight is the shit
[0:39:32] <StaticSunrise> the cleanliness has made him unstoppable

[0:40:01] <AMajorTom> Still, you have to have sympathy for people who don't overlevel when they play, and think a one hit kill playthough is less fun to watch

[1:33:42] <dsauce999> DAMN YOU
[1:33:54] <+tigerfang86> this game is just so charming
[1:33:54] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Does Mafia count as a race in this world?
[1:33:55] <sir_nack> @deviljhojho94 it's xenophobic, since shes an alien
[1:33:56] <+tigerfang86> goddamn
[1:33:59] <%Kahnicus> Wait, spray FLUDD on that red X.
[1:34:02] <%SWFanatic> Is this bayonetta 3?
[1:34:04] <%Nanocomputer> y r all the npcs the same model?
[1:34:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @JSebz Now I'm picturing all of Part 5 where every mafia member refers to themself as mafia and speaks in third person
[1:34:07] <BourneWarrior> Patty Why You Play Babby Game?
[1:34:07] <@lewdskeletor13> Dark Souls is the Hat in Time of video games
[1:34:07] <%Jaxnos> does hat kid age? because if not, Kid is a race don't @ me
[1:34:10] <%Kahnicus> Probably a blue coin in there
[1:34:11] <%Kataguro> That's really helpful
[1:34:15] <%deviljhojho94> @sir_nack Hmmm i suposse that's accurate actually 🤔
[1:34:16] <dsauce999> QHY NO SCHUUT?
[1:34:17] <BourneWarrior> Why you no Schut
[1:34:17] <ProfessorLitmus> pat in a hat is short and fat but we all love him and his Elmo cat.
[1:34:18] <%CJett92> Is that water flowing up?
[1:34:21] <+temporal_zenith> @Nanocomputer The Mafia has a VERY strict dress code
[1:34:22] <+tigerfang86> Pat is short and bad at jumping
[1:34:30] <mankeyfigh> Just got here chat, is this game good?
[1:34:32] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> better get used to the double jump, dive, jump manuever, Pat.
[1:34:36] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> I like the idea that your new friend is currently captured and screaming and hat kid has chosen to just run around goofing off.
[1:34:37] <dakuman13> you are doing surprisingly well with tiny child legs
[1:34:37] <aeonicvector> Dont forget, in AHiT 2 its CONFIRMED hat kid WILL get a gun
[1:34:38] <%deviljhojho94> The NPCS are all the same model because mafias are a single species
[1:34:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tigerfang86 If you are small you can double jump
[1:34:43] <%velemi> Pat why you no vineSchut
[1:34:43] <%deviljhojho94> like kids are a single species
[1:34:44] <%PanicSwytch> I want more settings change
[1:34:45] <%deviljhojho94> probably
[1:34:45] <@lewdskeletor13> Video games have taught me that short people are good at jumping
[1:34:45] <$cureneckbeard> Isn't Kid a race? And won't we be judged by how we treat that race?
[1:34:49] <rekinom> A Pat in Time
[1:34:49] <%Nanocomputer> @temporal_zenith I see, I see...
[1:34:53] <+tigerfang86> implying pat would ever try jumping at all @doc_ock_rokc
[1:35:02] <mayorrev> train
[1:35:10] <%Kahnicus> Mafias reproduce asexually though spores or budding.
[1:35:11] <+FloorBurger> This is Banjo Yakuzi
[1:35:16] <talisign> @tigerfang86 Cubes can't jump
[1:35:17] <b_ikki> if kids were a race in real life i would be mad racist
[1:35:19] <%korth367> missed the illusionary wall
[1:35:19] <%deviljhojho94> Mafia count as plants or mammals?
[1:35:20] <+masked_hero_lucky> you can use the default hat to locate your objective.
[1:35:22] <BobaFetish2124> very doorable
[1:35:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tigerfang86 you have a point

[2:06:35] <mayorrev> 1
[2:06:36] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> there's a badge that can keep that from happening, btw.
[2:06:40] <%randomarsehole> he beat you with his ASS
[2:06:41] <+Dimfish> his ass is too thicc
[2:06:53] <takiyami> sometimes you gotta dive before you double jump
[2:06:56] <Kratokian> That's game design 101, if you're chasing an enemy he has to 1. show how to make the path 2. show you the obstacle by activating it
[2:06:57] <lloydbannings> I love how the music gets more intense as you get closer
[2:07:00] <sir_nack> Can't dive after a dash jump
[2:07:02] <%deviljhojho94> at least it doesnt let you fall all the way
[2:07:04] <lloydbannings> when games do that Kreygasm
[2:07:10] <TheyCallMeVawn> Sprint is godlike
[2:07:11] <ScrapSentinel> He did the perfect timing thing
[2:07:11] <%SWFanatic> this is just like that boss fight in sekiro
[2:07:17] <T_Sasquatch> THATS HOW MAFIA WORKS
[2:07:18] <Megapikman132> you can't double jump, yeah
[2:07:20] <%deviljhojho94> mercy tomatoPain
[2:07:20] <+Dimfish> sprints great if used right
[2:07:26] <sir_nack> sprint's good when you dont need vertical height
[2:07:26] <%Frunkle24> sprint is everything
[2:07:26] <%Solidus_113> sprint swaps double jump for a long jump
[2:07:28] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Now kill him
[2:07:29] <HeadsHeldHigh> let go of sprint before jumping
[2:07:30] <RupanSen> Poor Mafia
[2:07:32] <knyttstories> Never gave Tomar his camera back FeelsBadMan
[2:07:33] <InkyDraconian> KILL
[2:07:36] <oligobear> mafia is victim here
[2:07:37] <dakuman13> sprint is life
[2:07:37] <qo_op> sprint is kino
[2:07:39] <Rincewind1998> Sprint basically gives you a long jump (that can still chain into dive) but you can't double jump after it
[2:07:39] <ScrapSentinel> no double jump, but you can still dive
[2:07:39] <aimlesshealer> yey
[2:07:42] <%FrustratedAF> oh was this what inspired the MK11 story? Kappa
[2:07:42] <allanmiri> Threaten him with a facehugger
[2:07:44] <%deviljhojho94> that mafia literally did nothing wrong
[2:07:50] <Silent_Fyraena> Now put him in a vase, Pat!!
[2:07:54] <%Dovahthing> that time piece music is sleep inducingly calm
[2:07:55] <warmnoid> sprint is the hat you'll be using the most
[2:07:55] <ReiDuran> SLIMY SPACE ALIEN
[2:07:56] <JazzyJulZ> There's tech to keep the speed and still have a double jump

[2:08:41] <a_mad_dragon> relics are part of a set, you need the whole set to display them
[2:08:42] <ScrapSentinel> It took me forever to find out that this game has a perfect timing mechanic that gives you a boost when you press jump once you hit the floor after a dive, it's such a gamechanger

[2:43:18] <takiyami> that's fair
[2:43:18] <$Valdorick> "Mods are gone, post ACSII porn"
[2:43:20] <transporterthesequel> Yeah keep that shit locked down
[2:43:21] <+Answer_Moose> Yes
[2:43:22] <dsauce999> RIP STORM FEELERS
[2:43:25] <DXLelouch24> YES
[2:43:25] <%TombstoneTTromboners> YES
[2:43:26] <%FrustratedAF> strident always knows your shame in the discord
[2:43:27] <%blastazoid26> Yeah kinda
[2:43:28] <%umbypokochan> yes there will be spoilers
[2:43:29] <DXLelouch24> BIG SPOILERS
[2:43:31] <%Divryne> FUCKING YES.
[2:43:36] <zamzoph> who cares about spoilers in an mmo?
[2:43:36] <arkv01> naw man ffxiv is a real plot ass game
[2:43:37] <+Fynale> but it's an mmo with big spoilers
[2:43:37] <%Divryne> BIG SPOILERS.
[2:43:37] <+timblenaut> GW2 has big story spoilers
[2:43:38] <%NWR_James> @lewdskeletor13 I mean I show up to see Demons, Pat is incidental
[2:43:39] <%umbypokochan> it may be an mmorpg but the story is half the game
[2:43:41] <+Masutasodo> Yea big spoilers
[2:43:43] <%tuesti> it follows a story so yeah there will be spoilers
[2:43:44] <Crankthulhu> Only Mark Hunts were kinda populated, nobody cared about Tripe Triad, or Chocobo Racinbg, Or Minion Battles, etc.
[2:43:48] <%TheSniperJoe> OMEGA SPOILERS
[2:43:51] <JazzyJulZ> Fuck, alright then lol
[2:43:52] <burntbread98> Hello
[2:43:55] <%Kataguro> "Is Disc 3 of FF7 going to spoil me? I just got to Disc 2"
[2:43:56] <%FrustratedAF> wish i could have gotten into 14, man, i tried :/
[2:43:59] <DXLelouch24> FF14 is an MMO with an ACTUAL GOOD STORY
[2:43:59] <%BioApple> is XIV viable as a single player game or do you just mean it's comparable story-wise? @AngriestPat
[2:44:00] <%TheSniperJoe> In fact, don't fucking tune into the live letter.
[2:44:04] <+gutlesscoward> I've never actually been able to finish a final fantasy game
[2:44:05] <jijipose> Why should I care, 14 doesn't have Lightning Kappa
[2:44:05] <+Answer_Moose> @AngriestPat I'm working my way through Stormblood at the moment.
[2:44:06] <%SaltyDongs> The ultimate spoilers
[2:44:06] <aeonicvector> Its WARFRAME tier spoilers
[2:44:08] <$Valdorick> "I can't believe Garland knocked them all down!"
[2:44:10] <RupanSen> Wait, can you play it in singleplayer?
[2:44:14] <OldOnyx> Is now a good tome to look in to FF14?
[2:44:19] <JazzyJulZ> @angriestpat Thanks for the heads up then, shit lol
[2:44:20] <%PanicSwytch> Super Cool Shit
[2:44:21] <OldOnyx> tome yeah
[2:44:21] <@lewdskeletor13> Won’t be spoilers for me if I don’t have any context apatDab
[2:44:21] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat oddly enough though the stuff discussed in shadowbringers is brought up in the heavensward patch stuff
[2:44:24] <%ItsRatman> Just got home from work. is Pat enjoying the game?
[2:44:26] <%TheSniperJoe> Eeeeh...it's getting there with Path Companions now.
[2:44:29] <+DankDunk> FF14 is just an ERP engine LUL
[2:44:29] <DXLelouch24> no one gives a fuck about Lightning SHE WAS FORGOTTEN
[2:44:32] <ReiDuran> They could rework it into a single player game.
[2:44:36] <%blastazoid26> FF11 is a singleplayer at this point
[2:44:36] <ScrapSentinel> Hopefully the Trust System fixes that
[2:44:37] <DXLelouch24> which is ironic
[2:44:40] <%skizzuto> I made it through the base game of ff14 with relatively minimal multiplayer
[2:44:44] <ReiDuran> Especially with that new NPC party member thing coming out
[2:44:46] <%blastazoid26> but not 14
[2:44:47] <%yeknomlive> most dungeons are required to advance story
[2:44:48] <+RushUnplugged> FF14 has a great story and you should absolutely go through it on your own, avoid MSQ streams if you care about it
[2:44:49] <zamzoph> other people DansGame
[2:44:50] <$Valdorick> Dungeons to story
[2:44:52] <+smevvster> "Fixes" MMOs should not be single player games.
[2:44:54] <+Answer_Moose> You have to dungeons for Story too
[2:44:55] <RupanSen> Oh, so it isn't the best FF game by default
[2:44:56] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat well shadowbringers is gonna have trusts so ppl can make a single player game
[2:44:59] <+Fenrisulfure> they're reimplementing trusts so soon 100% could be solo
[2:45:04] <Angry_Ev1L> FAITH system will save us from multiplayer LUL
[2:45:07] <dakuman13> A single player FF14 sounds nuts
[2:45:11] <BappoSama> I've been interested in ff14 for quite a while now..
[2:45:11] <person181> what classes would your rec/not rec
[2:45:15] <DraxTD> it's like WoW with LFR and such basicly
[2:45:17] <%castcode> TRUST
[2:45:18] <%blastazoid26> wat?
[2:45:20] <+fatal_penguin_> This game is basically Mirrors Edge
[2:45:23] <%blastazoid26> Really?
[2:45:26] <+Jonesman64> though random pub groups can be... difficult to clear with
[2:45:28] <%Divryne> Story only all the multiplayer stuff is relegated to dungeons and trails.
[2:45:28] <bradishungry> they forced cutscenes in big dungeons so it's better now too. at least for the last few arr quests
[2:45:28] <zamzoph> Trust no one. Not even yourself
[2:45:29] <+ChaosVulpes> Trust no one
[2:45:30] <+Answer_Moose> Yeah we do Pat
[2:45:31] <%Fadedblank247> ff14 is great
[2:45:31] <SnakeMarcky> A Hat i Time PogChamp
[2:45:31] <%D33TR> seems like a refined version of the squadron system
[2:45:34] <%tuesti> ???
[2:45:35] <+Fenrisulfure> it's from FFXI
[2:45:39] <bradishungry> once
[2:45:41] <+Answer_Moose> They've already shown it off
[2:45:42] <xeros720> recruit npcs to play with you
[2:45:42] <%tuesti> really? omgg that sounds cool
[2:45:42] <+PenmanLupine> the Trust No One System
[2:45:47] <+Fynale> it's for ppl with social anxiety
[2:45:47] <Megapikman132> build an army, trust nobody
[2:45:49] <%umbypokochan> seeing as how adventurer squadron AI are awful, i don't see that being fun
[2:45:51] <+Fynale> so they can enjoy the game
[2:45:54] <SummonerMagno> if that happens i might go back in
[2:45:58] <McAngrimStein> For people who play FF14 on a PS4, do ya'll use a keyboard and mouse, or just a controller or what?
[2:45:59] <PSI_Guy95> so social links? social links
[2:46:02] <+mercado94> nice. I might try the game then
[2:46:08] <%tuesti> thats so cool
[2:46:09] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@TheSniperJoe) (warning)
[2:46:13] <%Nanocomputer> controller
[2:46:14] <%Jetsfantasy> Noctis
[2:46:15] <Quietshun13> controller
[2:46:16] <tetriata> I just beat Ultima Weapon. Is it feasible for me to reach the end of the MSQ by the time Shadowbringers comes out? I don't want to stress it if not.
[2:46:18] <lilo52> READ TRAIN
[2:46:18] <bradishungry> @mcangrimstein it's totally playable on controller
[2:46:19] <%NotGran> pat have you done the squad missions
[2:46:19] <%yeknomlive> that was an april fools joke. the dating sim mechanic
[2:46:19] <%Nanocomputer> is pretty good on ff14
[2:46:20] <%Typhaeon> Also Command Missions have been in for a while
[2:46:20] <PSI_Guy95> damn I thought Moobot was dead still
[2:46:25] <Reanimator83> If that’s true I might pick it up
[2:46:26] <CandideCamera> distracted and running in circles while MMO talk
[2:46:27] <+PrimordialDonut> I'm always afraid to come back to FF14, never really got too far into it and I'm a long time wow player
[2:46:28] <gonvern15> Controller
[2:46:29] <%fallen92x> I use controler on both PC and PS4
[2:46:31] <%THATGUY_789> was playing as marauder for a while but couldn't afford The Monthly $20aud with the time I had
[2:46:32] <dakuman13> awesome so you dont have to play with people?
[2:46:32] <$Big_King_Coconut> thancred DansGame
[2:46:33] <bradishungry> @mcangrimstein legitimately good with it
[2:46:33] <McAngrimStein> Huh, cool, I'll prolly check it out at some point
[2:46:34] <%FrustratedAF> shit i need to preorder samsho still
[2:46:39] <+Innocuous_Goat> I might jump back into 14 if that's true
[2:46:39] <+smevvster> @tetriata Not unless you go and 100% no-life it.
[2:46:39] <InkyDraconian> BEAM ROOMBAH
[2:46:40] <+RushUnplugged> it WAS an april fools, years ago, but it was so good they're doing it for real now
[2:46:41] <zamzoph> Tankred endures
[2:46:42] <silvcrest> I wish @PSI_Guy95
[2:46:44] <CptBritches> That might actually make me play
[2:46:44] <$Valdorick> Terrible Robots Unsable (in) Shitty Trials. TRUST.
[2:46:45] <SummonerMagno> i would like that to learn to be a tank or healer without causing problems for others
[2:46:49] <+mercado94> that sounds nice. My main problem with MMOs is dealing with other people
[2:46:51] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat they have stated that trusts won't be faster than real people though they're generally for ppl with social anxiety
[2:46:53] <+Answer_Moose> Yes
[2:46:55] <%D33TR> yes
[2:46:56] <+Masutasodo> Yea
[2:46:58] <+metalsiren31> ..>Define feasible
[2:46:59] <%umbypokochan> only if you want to kill yourself slowly
[2:47:01] <+RCresham> You can do it
[2:47:01] <%QuadraticGravity> Yes.
[2:47:02] <silvcrest> Absolutely
[2:47:03] <tetriata> Oof
[2:47:04] <%Divryne> Yes.
[2:47:04] <%nmaten> and skip every cutscene
[2:47:06] <%QuadraticGravity> Pat's Exaggerating.
[2:47:06] <%D33TR> what
[2:47:07] <lilo52> @angriestpat read train and assemble burger
[2:47:07] <%TheSniperJoe> What?
[2:47:09] <+RCresham> I did it in a month and a half
[2:47:09] <+Answer_Moose> Bullshit Pat
[2:47:10] <troytaco> you could skip cutscenes ;3
[2:47:11] <+fatal_penguin_> Pat Plays Cellphone MMOs
[2:47:11] <%blastazoid26> its like 60hrs to reach shadowbringers
[2:47:11] <%Jetsfantasy> It's rough trying to catch up
[2:47:11] <%TheSniperJoe> No you absolutely could do it.
[2:47:12] <%castcode> 🤔
[2:47:12] <%NWR_James> Only 20?
[2:47:13] <zepelinnn> CRAZY TALK
[2:47:13] <%QuadraticGravity> Bullshit Pat.
[2:47:17] <silvcrest> Pat is extremely wrong. Again.
[2:47:17] <%Fadedblank247> its not that bad Pat, but it is alot
[2:47:17] <zepelinnn> you can do it easily
[2:47:19] <+Fynale> you can do it
[2:47:19] <jj_cabo> CRAZY TALK
[2:47:20] <BappoSama> Holy shit
[2:47:23] <+Answer_Moose> CRAZY TALK
[2:47:24] <+Eclipse_knight_> i wish warframe had that, so i never have to talk to anyone
[2:47:24] <+mercado94> crazy talk?
[2:47:24] <+RCresham> It's doable
[2:47:24] <vierleger> Pat is wrong. Leveling to 50 can be done in like 2 days.
[2:47:25] <hydragoon513> It's like a month with cutscenes?
[2:47:25] <BappoSama> that's worse than TERA
[2:47:27] <+metalsiren31> Dude 2.X is LONG
[2:47:29] <%Kataguro> You probably could but it would suck
[2:47:30] <+Fynale> just bash through the msq only
[2:47:30] <%TheSniperJoe> apatBig apatWrong
[2:47:32] <%Typhaeon> It's viable if you exclusively focus a combat class
[2:47:33] <Finchit> I skip every cutscene in 14
[2:47:35] <%Typhaeon> And do no side activities at all
[2:47:36] <tetriata> Definitely not skipping cutscenes
[2:47:38] <BappoSama> and I played that game since beta. D:
[2:47:38] <+RCresham> Apparently they made a lot of the stuff way easier in like 2.0 and Heavensward
[2:47:38] <%QuadraticGravity> It took me about two months and that was with taking weeks off of MSQ progress and no cutscene skipping.
[2:47:40] <+Jonesman64> heaven's ward and storm blood really aren't that long
[2:47:42] <ScrapSentinel> play tank and rush through
[2:47:43] <%castcode> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[2:47:45] <bradishungry> is it as long as 1.X?
[2:47:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> if you just do MSQ, you could do it if you playedc5-6hrs a day.
[2:47:59] <ScrapSentinel> nothing is as long as 1.x LUL
[2:48:04] <BappoSama> This is a really chill ass stream...
[2:48:07] <%umbypokochan> all i even care about right now is my house lol
[2:48:08] <+Answer_Moose> That's fair then
[2:48:08] <%yeknomlive> i played in vanilla and it was a lot slower back then. no potd and no roulette
[2:48:08] <CptBritches> Pat are you saying that you might possibly could be wrong? That just can't be
[2:48:08] <vierleger> I just started a new character on the Crystal DC and I'm going crazy fast.
[2:48:09] <ScrapSentinel> 1.x was fucking ridiculous
[2:48:10] <%Jetsfantasy> Yeah, old shit has changed from what I've been told when telling old players about my experience
[2:48:11] <+Fynale> this is now an ff14 stream
[2:48:15] <+metalsiren31> Heavensward is like a couple weeks
[2:48:17] <%yeknomlive> sorry realm reborn*
[2:48:18] <%Metballs> Each patch took about an afternoon of playing
[2:48:20] <DraxTD> Hay @AngriestPat have you been remembering to dance with every song?
[2:48:20] <+RCresham> Just make sure not to skip Crystal Tower on your way up
[2:48:20] <+metalsiren31> If you play it casually
[2:48:20] <lilo52> Read train
[2:48:21] <%Typhaeon> If you preorder you get an item that helps you level faster.
[2:48:23] <%AbnormalVoid> @AngriestPat it felt like 2 years to get through it, alright
[2:48:23] <pectusumbra> did pat look at the microwave earlier?
[2:48:23] <+RCresham> It's marked as optional
[2:48:24] <%NotGran> 2 months to finish the main story if your slow
[2:48:24] <+ObtuseDan> now if we were talking about wow you can just buy level 120 and be up and running in about a week
[2:48:26] <%Niney_Who> It's like that Pianta Village level PogChamp
[2:48:26] <+RCresham> But IT AIN'T
[2:48:27] <ricotez> i played through stormblood in a week with only a few hours per day
[2:48:27] <CrabSlacks> THE FLOOR IS LAVA
[2:48:27] <%TheSniperJoe> Dude you can catch up from level 1 to current MSQ in like three weeks of playing two hours a night.
[2:48:28] <ScrapSentinel> monkaS
[2:48:28] <zamzoph> THE FLOOR IS LAVA monkaS
[2:48:29] <SecretAgentPickles> Major, I'm burning up!
[2:48:30] <%Metballs> So that's like 15 days on just patches
[2:48:30] <i_worship_his_shadow> pat, you're really slow if it took you 2 years to finish heavensword
[2:48:30] <%PROUD2beGINGER> 3.0 is really long
[2:48:31] <Prevot> CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit
[2:48:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> Welcome to hell

[2:48:33] <Saltmeisterr> big lava
[2:48:33] <%Faustgesicht> yo googlygareth's xcom2 mod just dropped
[2:48:35] <%THATGUY_789> MMOs are hard for me cause I work 40+ hrs a week outside. and the mental effort isn't there for after work and the weekend is precious
[2:48:37] <@lewdskeletor13> ARSON CRIMES
[2:48:40] <%Metballs> Maybe 15 for the 3 big expansions
[2:48:41] <%TheSniperJoe> I literally am watching a friend do it RIGHT NOW.
[2:48:41] <Junkles> explain the laval
[2:48:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> stream the main story of FF14
[2:48:44] <%Metballs> So about a month is doable
[2:48:44] <%TombstoneTTromboners> mafia town on fire
[2:48:45] <%Fadedblank247> yeah that preorder earring with +xp and scaling stats is really nice
[2:48:48] <+ObtuseDan> does wow even count anymore?
[2:48:51] <AlertDOTEXE> 01230
[2:48:56] <RupanSen> Lavos won
[2:48:57] <PunishedMercer_> town volcano
[2:48:57] <Ion_Laser> The floor is lava!
[2:49:00] <+tigerfang86> VERGIIIIIIL
[2:49:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> genocide
[2:49:04] <+Answer_Moose> @AngriestPat Geting out of ARR MSQ content is the longest slog. After that is honestly goes pretty quickly.
[2:49:06] <$Big_King_Coconut> friggin mustache girl
[2:49:08] <%NovaKnightmare> MUSTAAAACHE
[2:49:10] <buffmurffy> sweet remix
[2:49:12] <%PlainSimpleTailor> These mafia guys have HORRIBLE scoliosis
[2:49:14] <+RCresham> Pat should do a MSQ cutscene rewatch stream some time
[2:49:14] <Ion_Laser> Mustache girl is Big Asshole
[2:49:16] <DXLelouch24> MUSTACHE VERGIL!!!!!!
[2:49:16] <Saltmeisterr> VERGIL
[2:49:17] <%BioApple> who killed more people, vergil or mustache girl
[2:49:19] <CandideCamera> Mustache Girl immediately destroys the city
[2:49:20] <Dr_Mooose> for a price
[2:49:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> @rcresham I doubt it, the first two packs were crazy, and I just did em a couple of months ago.
[2:49:22] <@commanderclaw> These guys don't have women, do they reproduce by budding?
[2:49:22] <+ravenrooke> is this a mario clone?
[2:49:23] <$Brother_Coduss> why are LAVA FAUCETS a feature?
[2:49:23] <%THATGUY_789> def wanna continue on FF14 tho
[2:49:24] <Finchit> BANGER ALERT
[2:49:29] <HeadsHeldHigh> The Seal the deal for this is death
[2:49:32] <+fatal_penguin_> Its Pompeii all over again
[2:49:34] <%TombstoneTTromboners> who would win in a fight
[2:49:37] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> so she's already literally trying to murder the mafia
[2:49:38] <%TombstoneTTromboners> mustache girl or vergil
[2:49:39] <+Dimfish> the nightmare version of this mossion is horrific
[2:49:42] <Wan6Saber> their heads are the size of her whole body athS
[2:49:42] <korsablade> Seal the Deal for this is a nightmare
[2:49:45] <Finchit> SourPls
[2:49:47] <+Dimfish> *mission
[2:49:48] <LunarRemix> Probably since they are a hive mind @commanderclaw
[2:49:51] <+ChaosVulpes> Beach level became Lava level. Nice twist
[2:49:52] <+Masutasodo> Death wish version is horrid
[2:49:53] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Mustache Girl confirmed mass murderer.
[2:49:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> gotta keep the lava somewhere.
[2:49:55] <PapermanXD> I love the mario sunshine vibe this game has
[2:49:56] <%Fenrisulfure> Fenrisulfure subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:49:56] <Kyo354> HW entire story took me a few weeks with skipping every cutscene that wasn't MSQ, and this was right before SB came out
[2:50:00] <DraxTD> hay chat ... how do I free camara in this game... holding Y does not enough
[2:50:07] <%Divryne> LUL
[2:50:09] <+mercado94> 24 hour stream?
[2:50:09] <+RCresham> Reminder that Heavensward is FREE
[2:50:09] <devanmuse> Mustache Girl isn't Vergil. She's GRIFFITH
[2:50:10] <ScrapSentinel> bigass Q&A
[2:50:12] <jijipose> I am excited for Game of Thrones tomorrow so I can see Woolie's soul fully leave his body on monday
[2:50:13] <OkamiDude15> @TombstoneTTromboners mustache has some tech
[2:50:20] <%decent_gaming> decent_gaming subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Pat I started at Heavensward a month ago and have almost caught up while levelling 2 secondaries and crafting
[2:50:20] <%Fadedblank247> that's actually a pretty cool idea Pat
[2:50:20] <dakuman13> I sure wanna know if I want to
[2:50:27] <+Dimfish> @draxtd free camera is in settings
[2:50:30] <+ravenrooke> @AngriestPat I cant get past the MSQ of ARR. Its so slow :(
[2:50:33] <StarMechV> I'm saving a Fantasia for the new races
[2:50:37] <thedysek> you get 7 days free right now if you already have an account and you havent played in a while
[2:50:38] <vierleger> Pray, return to the Waking Sands.
[2:50:39] <+RCresham> Praying for MCH rework
[2:50:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Kyo And see Heavensward took me just over a week.
[2:50:41] <DraxTD> @Dimfish thanks man
[2:50:42] <ReiDuran> Thursday?
[2:50:46] <DXLelouch24> if those GoT leaks are real we shall bear witness to THE ULTIMA FLOP
[2:50:51] <+fatal_penguin_> Will we see FEET?
[2:50:52] <dakuman13> First question: When will I hate it?
[2:50:54] <Aydarkzero> i don't got the money for that LUL
[2:50:55] <arkv01> Shoot the Shit: The best game on twitch
[2:50:57] <%THATGUY_789> it is. I started playing after Pat stream and had great time. just the time management was my bane
[2:51:00] <+Venhammer> I'm playing Final Fantasy right now
[2:51:01] <bradishungry> how much better than ARR is the story after?
[2:51:03] <+Dimfish> pls no GoT spoilers
[2:51:06] <%umbypokochan> FFXIV is amazing, but boy oh boy.. people take like 3 paragraphs to say one simple thing, and they use odd words... it's a bit of a chore.
[2:51:07] <DXLelouch24> a flop so powerful it has the power of Ultima itself
[2:51:07] <SnakeMarcky> @AngriestPat does it require a subscription ?
[2:51:09] <%Divryne> RIP me I have work 9 to 5 starting next week. apatDab
[2:51:11] <+Cuon_Alpinus> can you link a steam account with a normal account yet?
[2:51:14] <%blastazoid26> i desperately want a MCH and DRK rework
[2:51:23] <JazzyJulZ> I got to heavensward and then just started fucking around for like, 30 hours
[2:51:23] <%grayf0xh0und> grayf0xh0und subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:51:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> only problem is, I blitzed through it all and I burned out a bit.
[2:51:24] <%yeknomlive> @SnakeMarcky yes but i think there's a free trial type thing going on
[2:51:27] <%D33TR> they better change how dark arts works
[2:51:31] <TimetodiveLTX> Flop Prime
[2:51:33] <Delenay> I wish i could get into it but I don't care for the visual style =/
[2:51:35] <+Venhammer> @bradishungry WAY better, I'm honestly astounded the story is as good as it is, but only once you get to heavensward and beyond
[2:51:35] <SnakeMarcky> @yeknomlive thanks my man
[2:51:37] <+RCresham> I main MCH and it's fun as hell but a rework would be great
[2:51:45] <%skizzuto> wait really LUL
[2:51:45] <@lewdskeletor13> What if you’re disappointed tho?
[2:51:49] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Like recording a tv screen
[2:51:54] <jijipose> No spoilers, but if those spoilers are real, which they probably are, Woolie is going to be husk on monday.
[2:51:55] <thedysek> heavensward is free atm too
[2:51:57] <SummonerMagno> i just want dungeon with ai so tryhards dont yell at me for not playing a new class perfectly
[2:51:58] <+mercado94> at least they're not atlus streams
[2:51:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> stormblood took a lot longer than Heavensward
[2:52:00] <%Kataguro> Flags
[2:52:02] <%Jetsfantasy> WHM changes incoming from what I've heard
[2:52:02] <StarMechV> I hope they make Dark Knight less convoluted because I'm a baby dumb and DKR rotations confuse the fuck out of me
[2:52:09] <DraxTD> jump DOWN
[2:52:09] <Megapikman132> look down
[2:52:10] <DXLelouch24> yes
[2:52:11] <zedravan> blind
[2:52:13] <%Nanocomputer> SCH/SMN are fun.
[2:52:14] <+sixcubit> yes
[2:52:14] <StarMechV> Then again i'm a baby idiot that can't do better than Red Mage
[2:52:14] <+Dimfish> yes
[2:52:15] <%detsuahxe> Walk on the rope
[2:52:16] <%Totally_not_toby> gotta go on the ropes
[2:52:16] <CrimsonFox777> If it wasn't, it would tell you.
[2:52:19] <%Totally_not_toby> yeaaaah
[2:52:20] <+smevvster> I just want them to remove Dark Arts
[2:52:21] <%Totally_not_toby> he do it
[2:52:24] <+smevvster> Or change it substantially
[2:52:30] <Delenay> they seem ok in there
[2:52:31] <%DedlokPM> rooBlank
[2:52:34] <%DedlokPM> rooBlind
[2:52:42] <%stagemage> that was pretty sick actualy
[2:52:43] <+RCresham> It's free until level 35
[2:52:49] <zamzoph> EVE Online
[2:52:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's worth it though
[2:52:51] <%Divryne> It's fucking worth it though.
[2:52:52] <%blastazoid26> 11
[2:52:54] <AlertDOTEXE> ESO?
[2:52:54] <+Venhammer> runescape
[2:52:54] <%D33TR> like a premium
[2:52:55] <crunkers_> actual games as service
[2:52:55] <%Jetsfantasy> There's a cheaper plan if you only plan on using 1 char
[2:52:56] <%TheSniperJoe> It has a very extensive trial.
[2:52:56] <moogleboy1984> EQ2
[2:52:57] <+Fynale> FF11 has a sub still
[2:52:59] <Tisaric> is ESO B2P?
[2:53:00] <+gutlesscoward> how grindy is ff14?
[2:53:00] <Crankthulhu> Most of the korean ones
[2:53:01] <%blastazoid26> runescape
[2:53:02] <%CJett92> GW2
[2:53:03] <vierleger> I main AST and I am genuinely afraid of what they might add to that class. Can they even make the cards more complicated?
[2:53:11] <%yeknomlive> GW2 never had a subscription
[2:53:11] <%mastertwin2> ESO's is essentially mandatory if you want to play for extended periods of time
[2:53:12] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> SWTOR has a sub and the F2P is so bad it might as well be sub to play
[2:53:13] <+redyoshi5> missed it again
[2:53:13] <%PROUD2beGINGER> That's a lot
[2:53:16] <%umbypokochan> yes but you can't do a bunch of stuff like trade or join a FC
[2:53:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> FF11 isn't a real game
[2:53:18] <Delenay> i think wow has that until 30 /shrug
[2:53:19] <%THATGUY_789> I bought the base game for twenty AUD and then dominos had a deal for 3 pizzas 3 sides plus FF14 with all DLC at the time so I bought it again because it was a great game
[2:53:20] <Zarkith> Runescape is still subscription based too, isn't it?
[2:53:22] <crunkers_> yep
[2:53:23] <Silent_Fyraena> Guild Wars 2 is better :B
[2:53:28] <FairOnFire> i played the free version for like 50 hours
[2:53:32] <+RCresham> 14 is worth the subscription for the music alone tbh
[2:53:32] <bradishungry> @gutlesscoward 1
[2:53:36] <+Venhammer> @gutlesscoward depends on how you want to play, if you just play one class then its not too bad
[2:53:36] <+fatal_penguin_> Everquest Online?
[2:53:38] <+3InchMensch> DCUO might as well be subscription with how much they hamstring anyone who doesn't have one
[2:53:39] <%Despera__> Runescape has F2p still too
[2:53:39] <%yeknomlive> i actually revisted gw2 after like 6 years
[2:53:41] <+Innocuous_Goat> So when you say free until 35... What does that mean?
[2:53:45] <%umbypokochan> @AngriestPat did you ever own a house?
[2:53:48] <$i_am_therydon> this looks like Mario 64 almost
[2:53:48] <bradishungry> 1.x is rough but the world is great
[2:53:51] <Kratokian> How are the tanks right now?
[2:53:52] <moogleboy1984> Raubahn EX
[2:53:53] <+RCresham> I hear tales of Rhauban EX
[2:53:55] <%Totally_not_toby> that's incredible
[2:53:55] <%TheSniperJoe> The story and characters are also just...so good, better than many main stream FF games.
[2:53:55] <Tisaric> 14 is an absolute pain in the ass to level in though right?
[2:53:59] <%Kiiper> Raubahn Ex XD
[2:53:59] <+SeaBassTheLad> PIPPIN EXTREME
[2:54:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> you did on stream
[2:54:03] <+Masutasodo> Raubahn EX and the lines were hell
[2:54:05] <%NWR_James> Pat just summoned crazy talk
[2:54:08] <%blastazoid26> Rauhban EXTREME was broken LUL
[2:54:10] <@lewdskeletor13> Don’t let Hat Kid die BibleThump
[2:54:10] <%THATGUY_789> I quit like. how WOW is free to LVL 100
[2:54:13] <+PrimordialDonut> Is FF14 a game where you can have multiple characters? I remember you being able to do nearly everything off of one character
[2:54:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> @innocuous_goat it means you can play until level 35 for free.
[2:54:17] <%PROUD2beGINGER> f
[2:54:18] <+drkRising> nice to see you got dressed up for this stream
[2:54:18] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> F
[2:54:18] <%Divryne> You get your first jobs if you want at 30.
[2:54:18] <+Venhammer> @Tisaric Only if you level more than one class
[2:54:19] <bradishungry> @tisaric nope. it's pretty easy till last 10
[2:54:21] <Ion_Laser> F
[2:54:21] <Prevot> NotLikeThis
[2:54:21] <%Dovahthing> f
[2:54:22] <mayorrev> F
[2:54:23] <%FrustratedAF> specifically hitting 35 or level 35+ quests?
[2:54:23] <%Bane_Kaikyo> F
[2:54:23] <$RaikenTB> nooooo
[2:54:25] <Rubecks> Pat killed Hat Kid lordsD
[2:54:26] <%ThirdWelles> use your dive you animal
[2:54:27] <vierleger> 14 is easy to level in.
[2:54:27] <+RushUnplugged> you can't progress in a class after lvl 35, you can still play and try others or just hang out
[2:54:27] <alwayspronking> MORTIS
[2:54:30] <DraxTD> F
[2:54:30] <SecretAgentPickles> Most of them saved
[2:54:31] <Megapikman132> yeah
[2:54:31] <%Kataguro> Yeah
[2:54:31] <@lewdskeletor13> HAT KID NOOO
[2:54:33] <%skizzuto> yes
[2:54:33] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> Yes
[2:54:33] <pswayde> They did
[2:54:33] <Delenay> i think it checkpointed after that
[2:54:34] <%CJett92> you had checkpoints
[2:54:35] <+LucentWulf> the ones you hit saved
[2:54:35] <%Solidus_113> welcome to dark souls
[2:54:35] <%NWR_James> F
[2:54:35] <KaliasTV> There's only one left
[2:54:36] <Megapikman132> checkpoint
[2:54:36] <Caidezes> Yes.
[2:54:36] <DraxTD> yes pat those saved
[2:54:36] <+Venhammer> @PrimordialDonut Yes but you can just level all of the classes on one character
[2:54:37] <JazzyJulZ> Yes
[2:54:37] <jijipose> Yeah
[2:54:37] <tetriata> Can the free trial play Palace of The dead?
[2:54:37] <+Cuon_Alpinus> dying actually saved you time
[2:54:38] <Tisaric> they saved
[2:54:39] <$Valdorick> Checkpoints on all of them
[2:54:39] <pectusumbra> yes, you just went to the back
[2:54:39] <DraxTD> you are ok
[2:54:39] <%Nanocomputer> lvling in ff14 is pretty easy
[2:54:39] <%Divryne> Yes.
[2:54:40] <+Innocuous_Goat> Cool
[2:54:40] <%GabeSweetMan> YES
[2:54:48] <+metalsiren31> And you can do it on every job
[2:54:49] <%TheSniperJoe> Houses are awesome.
[2:54:49] <+Innocuous_Goat> I'll definitely be getting back in then
[2:54:53] <ScrapSentinel> Boivin estates
[2:54:53] <%NovaKnightmare> speaking of games as a service, did you see that excellent vid on Games as a Service by Ross of Accursed Farms? @AngriestPat
[2:54:54] <jijipose> What is this Ultima Online?
[2:54:56] <%PROUD2beGINGER> It's gone now
[2:54:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's about the first ten hours of the game if you're on a preferred world
[2:54:58] <$Big_King_Coconut> crafting DansGame
[2:55:01] <FairOnFire> you can level all the jobs to 35 too
[2:55:01] <%TheSniperJoe> I just put in an open air hotspring in mine.
[2:55:02] <+Dimfish> thought he was about to say dollars
[2:55:03] <$RaikenTB> I thought you lost your house?
[2:55:06] <qo_op> literally blind to the word checkpoint Kappa
[2:55:07] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat did you get the regalia car
[2:55:12] <%GabeSweetMan> House in game or House IRL?
[2:55:13] <$Valdorick> He did
[2:55:14] <HealingMind> does the game have a standard holy trinity, or is the healing more focused on every class?
[2:55:15] <%Jetsfantasy> I finally bought a room in our FC and I was so proud
[2:55:16] <%Kataguro> Weeb Town
[2:55:19] <+PrimordialDonut> How many expansions do I have to buy to be caught up?
[2:55:19] <HealingMind> A la GW2
[2:55:20] <NoirePanzer> Shiragane weeb
[2:55:24] <vierleger> FF14 has holy trinity
[2:55:24] <%Fadedblank247> yo fuck crafting in that game though, it always crushes my soul to level
[2:55:26] <ToshiDandelion> @AngriestPat hey pat im about to play ff7 for the first time. any tips?
[2:55:28] <+vhansmurfn> what server is pat now
[2:55:28] <+Hecubusx> do you play 11?
[2:55:30] <%Typhaeon> You get through Eureka?
[2:55:33] <ScrapSentinel> you'd be a fool to not get the regalia
[2:55:35] <+Venhammer> @PrimordialDonut 2 but one of them is free
[2:55:38] <%Kiiper> holy trinity but healers are expected to DPS
[2:55:38] <+ChaosVulpes> All his words suddenly sound like gibberish except for the word 'house'
[2:55:42] <%blastazoid26> @angriestpat Did you do Eureka?
[2:55:43] <%Metballs> What's your opinion on the official OT/MT split?
[2:55:44] <%umbypokochan> i love crafting, but i have no motivation to use to make money
[2:55:44] <+PrimordialDonut> @Venhammer Thank you!
[2:55:45] <StarMechV> @AngriestPat Did you get the Garo Armors yet?
[2:55:47] <$RaikenTB> Just like real life LUL
[2:55:47] <+RCresham> There'll be more when we rebuild Ishgard
[2:55:51] <+Dimfish> digital housing bubble
[2:55:51] <CrimsonFox777> Oh no, real world economics!
[2:55:53] <+Masutasodo> Oh yea I think heavenward is free untill shadowbringers comes out right now
[2:55:55] <vierleger> FF14's producer is a gigantic EQ nerd, apparently.
[2:55:56] <Delenay> why harder to get?
[2:55:57] <Notsocleveruser> I nabbed one of the last ones on Famfrit
[2:55:57] <%ThirdWelles> @AngriestPat Is there a reason you're not air-diving?
[2:55:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> Shirogane Drive Limiters off! Unlimited Form Engaged!
[2:55:59] <i_worship_his_shadow> feelsbadman
[2:56:00] <+ravenrooke> @AngriestPat Whats changing about money?>
[2:56:02] <InkyDraconian> y

[3:01:28] <vierleger> Is there any word on a ShB benchmark yet?
[3:01:30] <lotharrio> Paige is afraid of the bigg succ? But she's so bigg and strongg!
[3:01:31] <+Ryallen> A Tater Toddler Warrior
[3:01:32] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat have you used the ice hat on the jump pad at the foot of the slide on your ship?
[3:01:33] <+fatal_penguin_> Check for worms on burger
[3:01:35] <%umbypokochan> everyone come to cactuar and visit my house!
[3:01:36] <%THATGUY_789> I got sucked up watching Pat.
[3:01:37] <qo_op> ignoring burger lore SMH
[3:01:37] <justafoxhere> It probably will give her the big succ
[3:01:43] <%yeknomlive> sometimes they do
[3:01:44] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> @Brother_Coduss he doesn';t have the ice hat yet
[3:01:48] <Megapikman132> @Brother_Coduss he doesn't have the ice hat

[3:01:49] <+Masutasodo> Yokai watch came back
[3:01:49] <%Kataguro> You can get some cosmetics out of the cash shop I think?
[3:01:50] <+smevvster> They re-ran the Yokai Watch event.
[3:01:51] <+Ryallen> Yokai Watch event too
[3:01:52] <Zuzu_Pachulia> same for me. kinda wish i had the guts to dive into 14
[3:01:52] <%maskedriderhero> The Yokai Watch event
[3:01:53] <%VantomPayne> sometimes they do
[3:01:55] <%Shadowthedigger> The FF 13 event reran
[3:01:55] <QueenTipsy> some times they re run it
[3:01:56] <ScrapSentinel> No reruns but you can buy old event items for CASH MONEY
[3:01:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> the only issue I can see is the classes she'd dig are all behind a level wall.
[3:01:57] <%D33TR> they re-ran the ff13 event
[3:01:59] <%Shadowthedigger> And the Dragon Quest one
[3:02:00] <%TombstoneTTromboners> they did it once for the 5 year anniversay
[3:02:01] <lilo52> Now you have no weapon
[3:02:02] <+trivialcoffee> how flexible are classes in the game? are there hard stat/skill point investments or can you kind of change as you will
[3:02:04] <+Answer_Moose> All the event stuff that you could get, can be gotten on the cash store later though.
[3:02:05] <%Fadedblank247> yeah the Yokai Watch one they did more than once
[3:02:05] <%TombstoneTTromboners> ran a bunch of the old events
[3:02:06] <+mercado94> dammit no reruns? That kills the game for me
[3:02:07] <%PROUD2beGINGER> MONEY

[3:02:10] <+TastySammiches> because money
[3:02:10] <%TheSniperJoe> It's weird to me that they haven't re-run XI more, what with Tenzen being so important.
[3:02:12] <%Fadedblank247> and fuck that one
[3:02:13] <%blastazoid26> Money
[3:02:14] <HealingMind> Are any event rewards reobtainable, like Warframe?

[3:04:06] <zk_nails> Hey Pat, you ever give Danganronpa another shot?
[3:04:06] <+Ramsus88> i like that dungeons/story stuff is never invalidated/ignored in later expansions
[3:04:07] <%THATGUY_789> it's cocaine
[3:04:07] <moogleboy1984> Final Fanservice XIV
[3:04:08] <%TheSniperJoe> It's brimming with fan service for damn near every Final Fantasy at this point.

[3:04:18] <AlertDOTEXE> fantashee?
[3:04:20] <vierleger> FFXIV is just a constant stream of references to other FF games.
[3:04:23] <+ravenrooke> @transporterthesequel i told my friend I wouldnt even think about FFXIV until SAM came out. It Came out, and I cant get past the ARR MSQ.
[3:04:25] <buffmurffy> I don't care, but whatever
[3:04:26] <%NWR_James> this shit is just Mario Galaxy
[3:04:26] <StarMechV> @AngriestPat Are Ala Mihngos really as assholish fucks as people on the internet make them sound?
[3:04:26] <+Eclipse_knight_> i prefer streams where you talk a lot
[3:04:27] <Them00n> @AngriestPat I never heard the story of you quitting your job, can you tell it again?
[3:04:27] <%FrustratedAF> i mean where else was FF to go other than an MMO with all the classes and what not
[3:04:28] <dakuman13> I super care about that shit so thats great to know
[3:04:29] <+Mondeiya> ye dova, i've only played like 4
[3:04:29] <+ravenrooke> @transporterthesequel Its sooooo sloooow
[3:04:30] <lotharrio> How final is the fantasy?
[3:04:30] <lTaunto> sunshine turning blocks?
[3:04:31] <+Answer_Moose> It's better than WoW
[3:04:32] <troytaco> @AngriestPat Do you know what date the garo event ends on?
[3:04:33] <Sacksquatch> The controller support is fucking great
[3:04:34] <squirtkitten> What if you're coming from other MMO's like WoW?
[3:04:34] <ape_hawk> yeah, but guild wars 2 is MY jam, so, eh
[3:04:35] <%Fadedblank247> the Primal fights are always dope
[3:04:35] <LunarRemix> Whatever someone talks about some live service that's really good it makes me feels FOMO and really anxious
[3:04:36] <%stagemage> Im waiting on new glasses that i got specifically because i was getting back into 14
[3:04:38] <+Fynale> i mean fuck testuya nomura is designing the new raid's bosses so there's gonna be plaid everywhere
[3:04:40] <%TombstoneTTromboners> it's a very good game
[3:04:41] <$Big_King_Coconut> I can't play tab-target MMOs any more, they're so boring
[3:04:42] <arkv01> @vierleger yeah its a bit of a fanservice fest, that is my one beef with it
[3:04:43] <+Fynale> AND A NIER RAID
[3:04:45] <ScrapSentinel> Mistakes were made

[3:05:05] <BigCoffee> @DXLelouch24 A misunderstanding from Pat, don't worry
[3:05:05] <StarMechV> @AngriestPat What are your expectations for the Nier Raid?
[3:05:05] <Kratokian> if only you had a terrain traversal hat

[3:05:18] <+Venhammer> @squirtkitten it might feel slow at first because of the GCD but once you get to max you have a lot of off cooldown abilities to weave in
[3:05:19] <%umbypokochan> money isn't hard to obtain at all
[3:05:20] <%yeknomlive> you need money to buy cosplay for glamour

[3:07:08] <%Nanocomputer> BlackDesert is a bad time...
[3:07:08] <Katalist_> Pat's having an existential crisis over FF14 vs Warframe
[3:07:09] <%Over_ninek> apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[3:07:19] <dakuman13> BlackDesert is GARBAAAAGE
[3:07:19] <@lewdskeletor13> Everyone unsubscribe while he’s not looking
[3:07:20] <DXLelouch24> Rage 2 denied me editing the folder to fix it so it can go fuck itself
[3:07:22] <BigCoffee> Warframe is like, grinding and fast, ff14 is grinding and story
[3:07:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> What happon
[3:07:25] <SummonerMagno> !raffle
[3:07:30] <+Dimfish> dragonica online is the best MMO ever maxe, dont even debate me
[3:07:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> most MMOs are a bad time
[3:07:32] <%ThatGuyfromMars> !raffle
[3:07:33] <supersmolman> Pats gone type yeehaw in chat
[3:07:34] <%yeknomlive> hey chat what are some dumb riven requirements you can remember getting
[3:07:34] <%Dovahthing> I hope pat makes it to subcon forrest
[3:07:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> @brother_coduss Secret World Legends explicitly just makes you another soldier of your chosen faction.
[3:07:38] <%ThatGuyfromMars> yeehaw
[3:07:38] <+Doctor_Stew> Black desert is literally painful to play
[3:07:39] <CrimsonFox777> So who else is ready for Pat to get to the you-know-what level in the third area?
[3:07:42] <JazzyJulZ> I remember thinking black desert was good then I played ff14 rip
[3:07:55] <Graywolf_the_45th> I can't play warframe anymore after they removed quick melee.
[3:07:56] <+Venhammer> @BigCoffee FFXIV has a lot of love put into it, if you youre a music person its worth it for that alone because it has the world record for most pieces of music in a piece of media, and its all really good
[3:08:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> yankees typing yeehaw hurts my soul
[3:08:03] <+getinthetent> SWG was the best MMO ever made
[3:08:09] <+Dimfish> yeehaw
[3:08:16] <xeros720> i reached sedna in warframe and i just asked myself what was the point
[3:08:17] <+Whens_Marbles> SWG Died when Jedi were introduced so.. No.
[3:08:17] <%nmaten> yeehaw
[3:08:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> I remember thinking TERA was alright, then I started playing ff14
[3:08:22] <dakuman13> Actually what are some dumb things you have to do in 14? Because I can think of a billion in Warframe
[3:08:22] <%Dingus_Tickler> yeehaw KKona
[3:08:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> How's the stream going, folks? Just got here
[3:08:31] <+Doctor_Stew> @Graywolf_the_45th it doesnt feel any slower tho?
[3:08:31] <transporterthesequel> SWTOR is the most underrated come at me nerds
[3:08:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> yeehaw
[3:08:39] <%yeknomlive> i was a fan of rustyhearts rip
[3:08:40] <+getinthetent> I said was
[3:08:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> woohoo pizza
[3:08:42] <$Brother_Coduss> who the hell even yeehaws anymore? cowboys arent that big a thing these days
[3:08:50] <%FrustratedAF> shout out to F1NG3RS
[3:08:53] <+Dimfish> i yeehaw all the time
[3:09:00] <dakuman13> Tifa yeehaws probably
[3:09:02] <%umbypokochan> the one thing that feels so weird about FFXIV is that elements mean nothing. You can kill a thing made of fire with fire.
[3:09:03] <Crankthulhu> @dakuman13 Chocobo Racing, Triple Triad, casiono minigames, Crafting, Gathering, PVP that sucks
[3:09:04] <+Doctor_Stew> Codus hasnt been in the south before

[3:09:07] <%Dingus_Tickler> All the kids yeet now atpRtsd4
[3:09:09] <Arek_1> Naturalized yankee saying yeehaw!
[3:09:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> @brother_coduss I live in Calgary. Cowboys are as big as ever.
[3:09:13] <+Dimfish> its just like saying "oh boy" or "jeronimo"
[3:09:13] <%TombstoneTTromboners> hello pat
[3:09:13] <+Whens_Marbles> Was implies forhad greatness... Runescape had more depth than SWG :P
[3:09:13] <%Kataguro> Less than you'd think
[3:09:16] <Crankthulhu> @AngriestPat Speaking of Warframe, are you gonna do the Jovian Concord stuff next week?
[3:09:17] <%SWFanatic> apatHoldon
[3:09:18] <+Venhammer> @dakuman13 Most of the dumb stuff in FF14 is optional stuff, like crafting grind
[3:09:19] <danknugglit> Yeethaw
[3:09:19] <%Dingus_Tickler> No more yeehaws, we do yeets now
[3:09:21] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat did you think about that question

[3:09:38] <PapermanXD> besides they arent real bros'
[3:09:38] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> u gained me
[3:09:39] <+gutlesscoward> 2
[3:09:40] <%TombstoneTTromboners> negligible
[3:09:40] <Cherokia666> you mentally lost me
[3:09:41] <Katalist_> I was about to leave tbh
[3:09:44] <%yeknomlive> they all left to play ff14
[3:09:44] <ScrapSentinel> @AngriestPat This game only took like 20 hours to 100% you could easily just play through this game if you enjoy it
[3:09:47] <+Dyllopizzagames> 9 billion
[3:09:47] <dakuman13> Ok thats good
[3:09:48] <Nagamune> still here :P
[3:09:48] <%Wallabri> i just got here so +1 at least
[3:09:48] <%SWFanatic> Be right Back
[3:09:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> over 9000 XD
[3:09:51] <+Answer_Moose> I've been playing FF14 while watching your stream
[3:09:54] <arkv01> reminder that FFXIV streams will be ASMR heavy
[3:09:58] <Graywolf_the_45th> @Doctor_Stew it absolutely does. the melee rework forced stances on you so whenever I use polearms i just stop in place when ever i hit anything
[3:10:00] <dakuman13> Pee was clouding his judgment
[3:10:00] <arkv01> so tune into ffxiv streams if you want to relax
[3:10:04] <worldbrand> OH SHIT
[3:10:04] <CrabSlacks> I just zoned you out while looking at other tabs
[3:10:05] <%Dingus_Tickler> FFXIV has more polish to it afaik
[3:10:05] <SecretAgentPickles> BOOOO
[3:10:06] <Caidezes> COWARD

[3:10:15] <+Ryallen> Wait, what happened
[3:10:18] <Wan6Saber> strange question
[3:10:19] <Nagamune> BAMBOOZLED!
[3:10:20] <worldbrand> they scratch different itches, don't they
[3:10:20] <+Whens_Marbles> Pat loves BDO thats the twist
[3:10:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ree
[3:10:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Wow, ya don't like either game? Kappa
[3:10:21] <$Brother_Coduss> NO COMMITMENT
[3:10:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> they both scratch very different itches
[3:10:22] <%tuesti> true
[3:10:24] <dakuman13> I KNEW IT
[3:10:24] <Katalist_> Cowards answer
[3:10:30] <%Dingus_Tickler> Play Fortnite @AngriestPat atpRtsd2
[3:10:33] <SomersaultJustice> this is why he isn't married, he can't commit
[3:10:35] <42nfl19> Nah man, speed run that shit
[3:10:37] <zamzoph> PEOPLE DansGame
[3:10:37] <%tuesti> theyre too different
[3:10:38] <DXLelouch24> Warfframe is also FREE
[3:10:39] <+Jonesman64> they're too very different games
[3:10:42] <squirtkitten> there's a lot you cant do by yourself
[3:10:44] <DXLelouch24> ITS FREE
[3:10:48] <TimetodiveLTX> BOTH pretty
[3:10:49] <dakuman13> Yeah Warframe is also free that's true
[3:10:51] <$Brother_Coduss> people are DISGUSTING
[3:10:58] <rubbishbinge> Raids in warframe were ass
[3:10:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> don't play Fortnite @AngriestPat
[3:11:02] <%FrustratedAF> warframe is for big numbers?!?!?!
[3:11:10] <squirtkitten> and Warframe only has its interesting content about halfway through, which is why all my friends got turned off it
[3:11:10] <dakuman13> Raids sucked massive shit
[3:11:12] <HealingMind> Teralysts can be solo'd, Harry and Garry, are EXTREMELY difficult to solo
[3:11:13] <%umbypokochan> FFXIV is where you make friends and hang out and do dumb stuff
[3:11:14] <Crankthulhu> Pat play Apex ResidentSleeper
[3:11:14] <%FrustratedAF> i like big numbers Kreygasm
[3:11:16] <Darren716> You fucking lost me
[3:11:18] <%logoth_> the gep gun
[3:11:19] <BakaAkaKeri> FoolyCooly!
[3:11:20] <%AncelDeLambert> everything you just described SCREAMS wealth in Warframe
[3:11:26] <StaticSunrise> why did he start speaking in french?
[3:11:28] <FairOnFire> Is he speaking English?
[3:11:31] <xeros720> i guess horizontal progression drives me nuts
[3:11:32] <%Kataguro> Until power creep
[3:11:38] <powerprotoman> repeat what you said but in english
[3:11:39] <dakuman13> But did you get a kitgun
[3:11:40] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Is it possible to make yourself so much a big dick G that you can solo everything in FF?
[3:11:40] <Wan6Saber> dont forget amp weapons @AngriestPat
[3:11:43] <%SWFanatic> something something something shiny stuff
[3:11:46] <+cvp5127> which warframe has the biggest butt?
[3:11:48] <transporterthesequel> Dude I quit Warframe for FOUR YEARS
[3:11:49] <Kain5707> @angriestpat okay but what if you had to pick one to play and never play the other
[3:11:51] <%yeknomlive> yeah at around rank 12 you should have an aresenal enough to break the game so the challenge becomes lost
[3:11:53] <SiameseSneeze> Wisp comes out next week
[3:11:57] <DXLelouch24> its not hard to make money either, just find what relics give the hot shit and use said relics to make money
[3:11:58] <%Kataguro> @cvp5127 Pre-nerf Mesa Prime
[3:12:01] <transporterthesequel> And my Latron Prime still killed things fine
[3:12:04] <DXLelouch24> its how i got alot of my Primes
[3:12:08] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat I suck at builds in RPGs. I've messed up a bunch of MMOs and it's turned me off. How hard is it in FFXIV.
[3:12:08] <Crankthulhu> @42nfl19 No, current content is balanced for parties
[3:12:11] <pswayde> heh, "robot"
[3:12:11] <+peregrin_iii> tdogDog
[3:12:13] <+tigerfang86> FREAKBEAST
[3:12:13] <Darren716> But Im still stuck on my starting shit, when do i get new stuff?
[3:12:13] <%Ynkubus18> Hildryn has the biggest butt, here big fat ass can shield us all
[3:12:14] <%ArcanumMBD> I remember when I thought that when Latron Prime came out. Then they power creeped the ass out of the game
[3:12:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> My Inaros is bulky enough to do whatever, quite fond of him
[3:12:16] <squirtkitten> i got super turned off by having to level up every gun just to get mastery ranks, and how fucking long it takes to level weapons
[3:12:21] <%FrustratedAF> !uptime
[3:12:21] <+Venhammer> @42nfl19 The first time you do stuff you need to be in a party
[3:12:21] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 12m.
[3:12:29] <%supersmolman> supersmolman subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:12:30] <%Dingus_Tickler> Pre-Nerf 99% Damage Resist Trinity Prime atpFeelsBeardMan
[3:12:35] <pswayde> Hildryn has the biggest butt, she also has big dino feet
[3:12:35] <$Timesteel> can’t stop the Sand Daddy
[3:12:36] <Darren716> Like i put 20 hours in and still have the starting rifle, and dont see how to get new shit
[3:12:41] <Crankthulhu> @NWR_James Easy to nonexistent. Its pure horizontal and you dont need to deal with stats. Also you can play all classes on one character
[3:12:44] <jorgen57> I dont like when pat talks about ff14, becouse it reminds me that I can never enjoy the game
[3:12:49] <dakuman13> Warframe is crazy grind solo time
[3:12:53] <%Kataguro> Yeah, you jizz all over it whenever you play
[3:12:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> @nwr_james there are no builds. you level based on your job.
[3:12:59] <SiameseSneeze> Supra Vandal is goddamn awesome
[3:13:02] <+MikoNoPants> Shoots forever has high status
[3:13:03] <dakuman13> Yeah
[3:13:04] <+SolverCODO> "clip". again with this Pat
[3:13:05] <%NWR_James> @Crankthulhu @rumtumtugnutz This makes me happy
[3:13:05] <HealingMind> Machine gun is an understatement Kappa
[3:13:06] <squirtkitten> Warframe is 99% grind
[3:13:07] <%Nanocomputer> ALL CLASSES/ JOBS on one character
[3:13:09] <$Valdorick> Laughs in Harow's 2
[3:13:11] <$nademonkey1100> CLIP/1
[3:13:11] <%Dingus_Tickler> Toyota Supra Vandal? atpRtsd
[3:13:12] <veldinmusic> It shoots a lot and nothing can stop it
[3:13:15] <rekinom> Using my prisma grakata atm with a cc/cd riven <3
[3:13:18] <Kghaleon> When can we get Supra vandal again? I've played it since Switch release and haven't seen it once
[3:13:20] <SummonerMagno> arca plasmor 4 ñif
[3:13:23] <JazzyJulZ> @jorgen57 rip, why don't you enjoy it, do you think?
[3:13:23] <rubbishbinge> I wish daikyu was better
[3:13:24] <Katalist_> What does any of this have to do with what game he enjoys more
[3:13:25] <+MikoNoPants> Supra Vandal is a good Mag gun
[3:13:25] <%PipIV> apatBig
[3:13:32] <+Whens_Marbles> Id love to go back to Warframe but i am just so lost on what to do.
[3:13:33] <Goo_Ftroop> I'm using a Catchmoon as you speak
[3:13:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> so all Dragoons are the same. it just comes down to memorizing your rotation.
[3:13:36] <+thefakeh> nothing is a good Mag gun
[3:13:39] <squirtkitten> this is why we dont ask him about warframe, it never ends
[3:13:39] <mayorrev> ARCA PLASMOR THO
[3:13:42] <+Vidyatubes> hi patrick
[3:13:42] <Crankthulhu> @NWR_James You can min/max at super difficult endgame but its not required at all. And there are no builds, every class just need more numbers into their favorite numbers
[3:13:44] <%Kataguro> Fuck the Mastery Requirement for Void Trader
[3:13:45] <%yeknomlive> stuff a bunch of formas on it
[3:13:48] <+Rada150> im having fun with the wolf sledge
[3:13:53] <CSeriesJTYPE> but the design philosophy of these games is incomparable. you should be comparing warframe to diablo, not an mmo
[3:14:00] <a_mad_dragon> i'm a hek man myself, i have its damage up to 3.6k\
[3:14:01] <+MikoNoPants> The Supra Vandal's MR is higher than any Void Trader MR
[3:14:02] <%PipIV> ?
[3:14:03] <$Timesteel> I got it during last years tennocon relay
[3:14:04] <+dirtyh4rr1> Opticor Vandal though
[3:14:07] <SiameseSneeze> Shy is great
[3:14:09] <knyttstories> Any Drakgoon fans?
[3:14:11] <%NWR_James> @Crankthulhu that's great. Nothing sucks more than screwing up a build
[3:14:11] <Kghaleon> I never leave home without my Amprex, it's better than literally everything for me.
[3:14:13] <%AncelDeLambert> New thing, any good?
[3:14:16] <ReiDuran> @AngriestPat not getting the Supra Vandal killed the hype for Warframe for me. I worked a shitlong time trying to get it and I didn't get to the right MR in time
[3:14:24] <%logoth_> You never leave home without your mpreg?
[3:14:24] <rekinom> stradavar prime
[3:14:26] <%SaltyDongs> wasp
[3:14:26] <dakuman13> BLOWS THAT SHIT AWAY
[3:14:27] <%Kataguro> Prisma Grinlock a while ago
[3:14:27] <SiameseSneeze> The Crocs?
[3:14:31] <+kuervojones> Koredo
[3:14:32] <%castcode> Ogrys
[3:14:33] <%AncelDeLambert> Wow, look at this new murder bow that shoots twenty arrows at once. It sucks.
[3:14:37] <Crankthulhu> @ReiDuran You know you can still get it, right?
[3:14:42] <%yeknomlive> they added a really cool gun recently but it was locked behind that rep grind that i didnt feel like doing
[3:14:43] <LunarRemix> Wolf's sledge?
[3:14:43] <+SolverCODO> It's all about creating fun meme builds and using fun weapons, even if they're not the most efficient thing ever
[3:14:48] <Cobaltor_252> @AngriestPat if it doesn't kill the universe 10 times in one shot it's automatically Z-tier super garbage
[3:14:49] <SiameseSneeze> Stradavar Prime is... okay...
[3:14:52] <+Rada150> just watch quite shallow videos she pretty much sums up everything
[3:14:55] <$Valdorick> Tibron Master Race
[3:15:01] <SummonerMagno> feed it to your mr
[3:15:03] <+Qsmash_> what game?
[3:15:03] <dakuman13> Absolutely garbage
[3:15:05] <transporterthesequel> Guess ILL DIE THEN
[3:15:09] <+kuervojones> Arca Plasmor
[3:15:10] <%Kataguro> Tibron Prime is too powerful
[3:15:11] <Crankthulhu> Staticor Overgod Race
[3:15:12] <%castcode> good game
[3:15:14] <qo_op> too late, this is a final fantasy stream now
[3:15:14] <%Dingus_Tickler> I'll keep my Paris Prime atpRtsd4
[3:15:19] <$Timesteel> no augment then get fucked lol
[3:15:21] <+Rada150> sybaris was king for a time
[3:15:26] <%velemi> Yeah but stradavar prime looks great and supra vandal isn't the aesthetic I'm going for
[3:15:30] <%AncelDeLambert> what matters is "is the new thing GOOD ENOUGH"?
[3:15:32] <SiameseSneeze> Prisma Grinlok is the shit
[3:15:35] <transporterthesequel> Hek....hek...hek...HEK..HEK
[3:15:37] <+MikoNoPants> IF we are talking i only want to shoot something once
[3:15:38] <rubbishbinge> Back in the day it was Latron Prime or bust
[3:15:39] <RupanSen> Horizontal progression usually implies opening different approaches
[3:15:40] <%yeknomlive> that's where riven farming comes in.
[3:15:40] <%AncelDeLambert> cuz if it's GOOD ENOUGH you'll have fun
[3:15:40] <squirtkitten> this used to be a hat in time stream
[3:15:41] <%Solidus_113> But sometimes there's a fun factor to the gun, like Arca Plasmor and Corinth. Neither are stronger than Tigris Prime, but they're FUN
[3:15:42] <+MikoNoPants> Tigris Prime is still a beast
[3:15:42] <$Valdorick> Got a fucking Pyrana Riven the day before Pyrana Prime released? Holy shit, I'm never replacing my side arm.
[3:15:44] <%Kataguro> Vaykor Hek will always be my love
[3:15:45] <jorgen57> @JazzyJulZ I just get extremely anxious when I get control of my charecter and I dont know why its really weird
[3:15:50] <+gruff_gridof> doodScrub
[3:15:51] <+Answer_Moose> DRK make GREAT off-tanks

[3:15:58] <NeroInfinite> VEK HOR HEK
[3:16:01] <+Fynale> has a skill called "the Darkest Night"
[3:16:05] <%korth367> axes are cooler
[3:16:08] <+Eclipse_knight_> you dont have to use the absolute optimal build though
[3:16:12] <%Kataguro> Fight For-E-Ver
[3:16:13] <person181> 5ever
[3:16:13] <%ItsRatman> Pat likes two handing it?
[3:16:14] <+MikoNoPants> I have a flux rifle riven however
[3:16:17] <$Valdorick> Of course, if DE wanted to release weapons that matter, they could always, I don't know... RELEASE A CRIT BASED SHOTGUN FOR ONCE!?
[3:16:18] <dsauce999> 5ever
[3:16:19] <Kain5707> eureka is fun Kappa
[3:16:20] <%Ynkubus18> WF is rolling with what you like and then bringing the best your comfortable with using to fight the hard shit
[3:16:22] <+MightyMarlowe> I still can't believe they gutted my DRK for the role actions. I feel defiled
[3:16:23] <%TombstoneTTromboners> And it sucks
[3:16:23] <arkv01> yeah the grind in 14 is fucked up sometimes
[3:16:24] <%Typhaeon> Hello, I'm here to tell you about Eureka
[3:16:26] <person181> how shiny though?
[3:16:27] <Sacksquatch> And a pet
[3:16:29] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> life is so meaningless
[3:16:33] <+Ryallen> That's mostly relic weapons though
[3:16:40] <+SubtleAddict> Are you the tank that sits in Grit and spams emnity combo
[3:16:45] <%Kataguro> What a great name
[3:16:48] <Aydarkzero> that sounds badass
[3:16:49] <%Dingus_Tickler> @Eclipse_knight_ Yeah, but what if I could just DO 1.4% better with this optimal build?!? sbfpSetIn
[3:16:49] <%yeknomlive> man why does atmas stuff always have to be so agonizing every time
[3:16:52] <+Venhammer> I don't do relic weapons because its too grindy
[3:16:57] <Dr_Mooose> cool name too
[3:17:02] <+Ryallen> The 240 relic weapon?
[3:17:02] <dakuman13> yeah thats pretty cool looking
[3:17:03] <%ArcanumMBD> Holy fuck this thing is edgy
[3:17:04] <%GarbageNirvana> I didn't miss it all did I
[3:17:06] <+Ryallen> Fuck that's old
[3:17:09] <person181> ya lore time
[3:17:10] <%SWFanatic> fuck it we'll do it live
[3:17:12] <%Jetsfantasy> It's a monster hunter greatsword
[3:17:14] <+alphonseisbest> yeyeyeteye
[3:17:15] <+Shaggnar> The name is cool, but that sword looks dumb
[3:17:16] <Kain5707> thats not the last one LUL
[3:17:17] <%umbypokochan> moogle weapons > all other weapons
[3:17:18] <arkv01> anything that isn't the minimum to get me through the main story is superfluous for me
[3:17:20] <%Kataguro> @yeknomlive Because fuck you, grind until you drop dead. Also pay another month of sub
[3:17:21] <%Typhaeon> You can stat roll the current relic weapon
[3:17:22] <JazzyJulZ> @jorgen57 Oh weird, ahah I was expecting issues with the design of the game or something, ahah. Think it's cuz it's online? Just curious :P
[3:17:23] <Kain5707> lux is the good one
[3:17:24] <%Kiiper> You can buy the replicas for glamour though
[3:17:35] <Mailboy> where is the box
[3:17:36] <%Metballs> Cronus Lux is my boi
[3:17:36] <Kain5707> ^

[3:17:59] <%VioletHeart> That's a cool sword.
[3:17:59] <CeeDee__> looks like a monster hunter weapon
[3:17:59] <Aydarkzero> huh

[3:18:08] <+gruff_gridof> doodStare
[3:18:08] <Sacksquatch> Cool as fuck
[3:18:08] <HealingMind> It looks like a big sword version of the Mios to me
[3:18:09] <person181> wow, it; it just is the soul edge
[3:18:10] <%TheDullaMAN> It's a big knife
[3:18:10] <+Ryallen> The glowing one looks bad but that's not bad
[3:18:10] <%SWFanatic> looks like cloud's sword
[3:18:11] <%Fenlig> Thats a dumb looking sword
[3:18:12] <+ChaosVulpes> It's... adequate.
[3:18:12] <%korth367> bullshit
[3:18:12] <$Timesteel> meh
[3:18:12] <Skullcrush04> Looks more like a Dark Souls sword
[3:18:13] <%Shadowthedigger> Chaos blade is more soul edge than that but yes
[3:18:13] <NeroInfinite> And now it's TRASSHH
[3:18:13] <%stagemage> thats pretty tight
[3:18:14] <CSeriesJTYPE> the glow on Cronus is the coolest tho
[3:18:15] <Mr_Loboto> it pretty ok
[3:18:16] <%korth367> EVERYONE had it
[3:18:18] <InkyDraconian> Smashes goth pussy
[3:18:18] <lotharrio> Reminds me of the Sparda, actually.
[3:18:18] <rubbishbinge> What a handsome sword
[3:18:19] <%PROUD2beGINGER> GLOW
[3:18:20] <%Dovahthing> black scissor blade
[3:18:21] <T_Sasquatch> eh
[3:18:22] <RupanSen> 2edgy4me
[3:18:23] <+metalsiren31> Lockhart is the true DRK sword glaam
[3:18:23] <Kain5707> @AngriestPat theres a better picture of it
[3:18:23] <Kingtut9009> That's like a WoW kind of eh purple at best
[3:18:24] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat can i only assume that FF14 has Cloud's sword somewhere?
[3:18:25] <+HostilePoundcakes> Meh
[3:18:26] <JazzyJulZ> It's purty fuckin cool you guys
[3:18:28] <Katalist_> and now it's completely useless
[3:18:36] <+Ryallen> @mayorrev No, actually
[3:18:36] <Intolerable> Big Dumb Anime Sword ©
[3:18:40] <mayorrev> aw
[3:18:40] <DXLelouch24> if it doesnt have an evil looking eye its not Soul Edge, shut up Pat
[3:18:41] <+Rada150> that's the blade part of the Mios from warframe
[3:18:41] <el_hearto> Professor Pat I think i'm in the wrong classroom
[3:18:44] <Crankthulhu> Pat and Chat acting like Glamour doesn't exist
[3:18:46] <dsauce999> Everyone had it Kappa
[3:18:46] <%yeknomlive> you can get cloud's advent children clothes
[3:18:54] <+Fynale> i got it just so i could get the cronus cuz i thought the cronus was cooler
[3:18:57] <%tuesti> hell ye
[3:19:01] <%Dingus_Tickler> Why not just get a gun? They all deal the same damage - enough atpRtsd2
[3:19:01] <%tuesti> ye
[3:19:02] <+Ryallen> The HW relic weapons look good
[3:19:05] <NoirePanzer> Turned into G L A M
[3:19:05] <CSeriesJTYPE> but GLAM
[3:19:06] <%TombstoneTTromboners> correct
[3:19:06] <%Kataguro> TRESH
[3:19:06] <Kain5707> its for glamour
[3:19:07] <%yeknomlive> glamour baby
[3:19:11] <StarMechV> GLAMOUR
[3:19:13] <%king_wragles> Did the stream just end?
[3:19:13] <+MightyMarlowe> Weapons aren't junk if they look good as glam
[3:19:18] <+Ryallen> Trash compared to the level 70 gear
[3:19:20] <%liquidsnk83> liquidsnk83 subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Stay Angry!
[3:19:20] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@CSeriesJTYPE) (warning)
[3:19:20] <+gerenago> Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
[3:19:25] <Mr_Loboto> if your sword doesn't have a menacing eyeball is it even really a sword?
[3:19:27] <%korth367> @AngriestPat i get to be salty as a WAR main at that time with my relic being a fucking level 30 axe reskin
[3:19:29] <transporterthesequel> Glamour is the true endgame
[3:19:30] <%Fenlig> MMO's are just consumerism but more accessible
[3:19:30] <CSeriesJTYPE> glam is the only endgame in ffxiv
[3:19:30] <dakuman13> that looks like a big Fate sword
[3:19:31] <+ChaosVulpes> That's how ALL MMO expansions work. All your hard grinded for loot from raids are now bitch gear, go grind the new shit fuckers!
[3:19:31] <%Kataguro> @king_wragles He's continuing after this. Just reading donations and also getting really sidetracked
[3:19:33] <+blewbeary> left in the dirt
[3:19:35] <person181> number ALWAYS go up
[3:19:40] <%Dingus_Tickler> That's why you don't play MMOs, kids atpCap
[3:19:43] <Psykoknight65> @angriestpat do you having any tips for getting good at Yakuzas combat, I keep getting hit stunned and enemies are blocking way too much
[3:19:44] <%tuesti> big mood im scared to go back
[3:19:46] <%yeknomlive> it's so hard to get back into ff14 and playing catchup
[3:19:48] <%king_wragles> @Kataguro ah cool, I just came in and saw the Elgato screen
[3:19:49] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Yeah fuck off with that entirely...
[3:19:52] <%ssjklyco> Everyone becomes Jiren
[3:19:52] <vierleger> Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
[3:19:56] <%Typhaeon> It's significantly easier to get back in the game
[3:19:58] <dakuman13> now I definitely dont want to play LUL
[3:19:58] <%tuesti> yeah
[3:20:00] <CSeriesJTYPE> who fuckin cares just buy vendor gear that meets the minimum item level and glam whatever you want
[3:20:06] <+Fynale> it's basically Number Go Up
[3:20:07] <%tuesti> i love 14 man fuck
[3:20:08] <%SWFanatic> So which one do you like more?
[3:20:08] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @dakuman13 Seconded
[3:20:09] <$Kaialb> Just glamour up?
[3:20:10] <squirtkitten> thats why Transmog is a great system, yo u can keep the gear you got forever
[3:20:17] <$Valdorick> !raffle [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
[3:20:19] <+linSP> number go up?
[3:20:20] <Katalist_> Pay them to grind the same gear over and over. Mmos so fun
[3:20:22] <+metalsiren31> Tanks better not just buy vendor gear at min ilvl
[3:20:23] <indig0bird> Equinox
[3:20:25] <%GabeSweetMan> But does the STRENGTH GO DOWN?
[3:20:28] <+SolverCODO> Octavia!
[3:20:29] <Wan6Saber> Ember Prime
[3:20:32] <CSeriesJTYPE> you barely FEEL number go up in ffxiv
[3:20:35] <NeroInfinite> Ember Prime
[3:20:36] <veldinmusic> Chroma
[3:20:36] <Onamar> Oberon also unkillable
[3:20:39] <worldbrand> actually the problem is that there isn't really a cap, we just keep finding new ways to scale our bullshit into infinity
[3:20:39] <squirtkitten> did someone say Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
[3:20:42] <+alphonseisbest> ma boi Umbra Nidus
[3:20:42] <NeroInfinite> Oberon
[3:20:48] <$Kaialb> Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
[3:20:49] <reiju_22> cirSmug
[3:20:50] <%Kataguro> He's also a very good boy
[3:20:51] <veldinmusic> Yea thats where I'm at right now
[3:20:52] <%Ynkubus18> Literally any of them if your tooled up right
[3:20:54] <dakuman13> I like versatility like that tho
[3:20:55] <ManlyMcBeefington> free at lvl 30
[3:20:55] <+dirtyh4rr1> until prime version comes out
[3:20:57] <+RushUnplugged> Mag + Mara Detron, endgame for people of CLASS
[3:20:57] <+Aresius_> Nidus is mAh boi
[3:21:01] <%HRDSalami654> You get all frames for free Pat.
[3:21:04] <CeeDee__> wanna get all the things
[3:21:07] <AgtDrake> Mesa and Ash are my jam
[3:21:07] <+UrielCobalt> exactly
[3:21:09] <CeeDee__> getting the things is fun
[3:21:21] <dakuman13> i want to get off the treadmill tho
[3:21:22] <%HRDSalami654> Ah.
[3:21:22] <%MagickBurritoh> So Warframe is better
[3:21:23] <%Kataguro> Mesa Prime's killing power is so absurdly enjoyable
[3:21:23] <+Eclipse_knight_> banshee highest damage potential @angriestpat
[3:21:28] <+SolverCODO> Warframe is a dragon hoarding simulator
[3:21:28] <%Keaton_x> I'm a filthy fucking Rhino Prime casual.
[3:21:29] <Caidezes> 14 sounds boring as shit.
[3:21:29] <ManlyMcBeefington> Excalibur Umbra comes with a slot
[3:21:32] <Apolonm> Always a Loki main
[3:21:32] <rubbishbinge> Meanwhile I'm just trying to use Garuda without embarrassing myself
[3:21:35] <%TheDullaMAN> It's "I want it" vs. "I need it." @AngriestPat
[3:21:36] <%Kiiper> Kiiper converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[3:21:44] <Katalist_> Yes, "fun"
[3:21:49] <dakuman13> i think the friends part sound better than having to keep up with everything
[3:21:50] <$Valdorick> "Kill 5 moogles in cold blood." YOU GOT [Ultimate Sword of Killing Edge +5]
[3:21:59] <RupanSen> They both sound like horrible experiences tbh LUL
[3:22:00] <%TombstoneTTromboners> yeah
[3:22:04] <%FrustratedAF> fuck those moogles
[3:22:04] <JazzyJulZ> Y'all in the chat don't know fun
[3:22:06] <+SolverCODO> Warframe is a dragon hoarding simulator because no matter how much you collect you're still a fucking dragon that can destroy everything
[3:22:07] <%HRDSalami654> What keeps me coming back to Warframe is the systems changing.
[3:22:09] <SummonerMagno> crack then meth then crack again
[3:22:09] <%Kataguro> New War soon hopefully
[3:22:10] <+Ryallen> It's really not that hard to get good gear in the game, the relic weapons are not the only weapons to get by far
[3:22:13] <Scharfster> Just got here, pat takin a break? :0
[3:22:15] <indig0bird> Basically what I did
[3:22:15] <SuperFineButtHairs> "pat talks about his warfram addiction like its okay"
[3:22:15] <%HRDSalami654> And the movement.
[3:22:22] <Explodincatz> the hamster got tired and got off the wheel
[3:22:22] <squirtkitten> @AngriestPat how do you keep enjoyment in Warframe? I have 145 hours and lost interest due to having to level up weapons all day for mastery ranks
[3:22:25] <+Ryallen> There's Primal weapons, the tomestone weapons, there's crafted weapons
[3:22:28] <jorgen57> @JazzyJulZ maybe its the huge amount of menus and diffrent things you have to keep track of. or its just the online. I still hate that I cant enjoy it becouse the problem ultimatly comes from me.
[3:22:29] <%Kataguro> @Scharfster Break, donation, then more Hat
[3:22:30] <CeeDee__> you can sprint burst in FF and return to a nice long jog in warframe
[3:22:31] <$Valdorick> I mean, to be fair, I swap between WoW and Warframe...
[3:22:32] <+ChaosVulpes> Crack, then meth, then crack again, then meth, then RED BULL
[3:22:32] <Ominnous> in the way that makes them sound like bad games
[3:22:35] <Scharfster> shweeet
[3:22:37] <%yeknomlive> what pat's explaining the whole burnout experience
[3:22:39] <+Ryallen> Relic weapons are for people who want something to do, so it's a goal to work for
[3:22:39] <NoirePanzer> @Scharfster He's talking about which mmo crack to take
[3:22:43] <firmlygraspi1> Pat's playing the Shadman game!
[3:22:43] <%HRDSalami654> The new melee update makes me feel like a cosplay version of DMC.
[3:22:43] <televisedrevolting> @superfinebutthairs He can quit ANYTIME HE WANTS
[3:22:44] <dakuman13> but is it fun
[3:22:49] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat do you recommend starting as a tank?
[3:22:54] <+d00msdaydan> he figured it out
[3:22:55] <Intolerable> Your microphone has SO MUCH FUCKING FUR on it.
[3:22:57] <TimetodiveLTX> burnout 3 is the best in the series
[3:22:58] <reiju_22> what was that sound
[3:23:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> They're not games for everyone
[3:23:00] <vVAstrAVv> learn to talk and play please
[3:23:02] <BigCoffee> respect the grind, it's like metaphysical meditation
[3:23:05] <%Kataguro> They're both huge timessinks, but they've got good stuff in the productivity hole. Like music.
[3:23:06] <%tuesti> ff14 is fun, even playing by yourself, the music and environment and story are so nice
[3:23:06] <veldinmusic> You have to like the number going big up
[3:23:06] <%AncelDeLambert> the new Warframe mission better be good, because I'm getting burnt out again and FUCK trying to do eidolons, I just don't have the interest
[3:23:08] <Kain5707> @SleepyMaribo yes because queue times are instant
[3:23:08] <CeeDee__> one man's poison is another man's gogo juice
[3:23:10] <BigCoffee> Empty head, grind
[3:23:10] <televisedrevolting> They ain't my style, but I'd still watch it.
[3:23:10] <Crushter> I think some people don't understand what verticle and horizontal climbs are
[3:23:11] <+gruff_gridof> yeah nerds
[3:23:12] <%Dingus_Tickler> The Gremlins.
[3:23:14] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Number need go big faster
[3:23:15] <CSeriesJTYPE> warframe's main gameplay is just killing diablo mobs for hours
[3:23:16] <+Movemeister> Burnout 3 IS the best i n the series
[3:23:20] <%Dingus_Tickler> Number Gremlins.
[3:23:21] <$Valdorick> Woolie wants the cool things, and don't stop him.
[3:23:22] <worldbrand> woolie doesn't care about numbers, he just wants his skill to get bigger
[3:23:23] <42nfl19> So what you are saying is that...WE SHOULD ALL USE @AngriestPat 's Warframe Referral link! Join now today! [This has been your free shill]
[3:23:23] <%stagemage> they fulfill a very specific desire
[3:23:26] <Notsocleveruser> You reading patch notes with Clemps is what got me in. I figured if patch notes could be exciting enough, then there was something special about the game.
[3:23:26] <dakuman13> Im not crazy about big numbers I just want to play cool thing and not worry about power creep
[3:23:29] <Kratokian> @AngriestPat how do you feel about dumb idle games
[3:23:30] <+ChaosVulpes> The only GRIND FOR GEAR game I enjoyed is Monster Hunter... cause the fights are usually fun as fuck
[3:23:30] <Arek_1> @AngriestPat What is horizontal/vertical progression?
[3:23:31] <vierleger> This is why I like Path of Exile. You make your number go big, then new league starts and you make big number again (but different)
[3:23:33] <+MightyMarlowe> @SleepyMaribo Tanking can be stressful to learn, but it's so worth it
[3:23:34] <SummonerMagno> but the numbers... and they are red instead off yellow
[3:23:34] <SuperFineButtHairs> i cant disagree with that
[3:23:37] <SuperFineButtHairs> i love MH
[3:23:41] <%HRDSalami654> I was on the Warframe train for years because they kept changing core gameplay.
[3:23:44] <JazzyJulZ> @jorgen57 Yeahh that's fair enough, I know I was crazy overwhelmed too, ahah. Hopefully one day you can get into it but it's all good :P
[3:23:47] <%HRDSalami654> lol
[3:23:48] <%logoth_> lol
[3:23:49] <%TheSniperJoe> wat

[3:25:11] <dsauce999> What?
[3:25:11] <%Dingus_Tickler> Diagonal Progression atpCap
[3:25:11] <NeroInfinite> The fuck
[3:25:11] <Futurecity10> Wait, john wick 3 is out?!
[3:25:11] <%Typhaeon> They had no progression at all, turns out
[3:25:12] <person181> so they had none
[3:25:12] <arkv01> fuckin laterals
[3:25:13] <CSeriesJTYPE> @transporterthesequel 14 has both of those. you grind your number until you meet the current cap and then you grind for cool looking stuff
[3:25:14] <%duneblythe> I dont understand it either. kinda just nodding along
[3:25:14] <Katalist_> No progression at all PogChamp
[3:25:16] <TimetodiveLTX> this ff14 and warframe stuff would be a good clip/highlight
[3:25:17] <%yeknomlive> so no progression?
[3:25:17] <%D33TR> so no progression LUL
[3:25:18] <rubbishbinge> wat
[3:25:18] <Ion_Laser> this sounds like a horrible idea
[3:25:19] <Novillion> thats just horizontal
[3:25:20] <+ChaosVulpes> Sea of Thieves died so fucking fast. I only just now remembered it was a thing from your mentioning it.
[3:25:20] <%korth367> wat
[3:25:21] <NumbusPlays> no progression
[3:25:22] <arkv01> so MOBAs?
[3:25:25] <%tuesti> sounds bad man
[3:25:26] <+RushUnplugged> that's horizontal, and they lied
[3:25:26] <FatherGreyBeard> what
[3:25:27] <+OrochiTabris> laaateral
[3:25:28] <Arek_1> @AngriestPat Yeah, I was here for that. It's just that this was the first time I'm hearing those terms.
[3:25:31] <+Jonesman64> Lateral means horizontal....
[3:25:33] <StarMechV> And it ALMOST KILLED THE GAME
[3:25:34] <%ItsRatman> Lateral... is just a synonym for horizontal?
[3:25:34] <LunarRemix> So Weapon unlocks in TF2?
[3:25:35] <reiju_22> atpRtsd
[3:25:35] <+d00msdaydan> did they ever fix that?
[3:25:38] <%Dovahthing> like blast processing
[3:25:40] <+Johnsonunit> SoT great tho
[3:25:43] <Angry_Ev1L> You need to play in SoT as if it's PvP game. Otherwise it's shit
[3:25:44] <Kratokian> A lot of games aren't based on progression mechanics in the first place soo
[3:25:45] <lilo52> Lateral is a synonym for horizontal
[3:25:49] <Ion_Laser> No progression? Then what the fuck is the point of the MMO game?
[3:25:49] <vierleger> Longitudinal progression
[3:25:52] <%Typhaeon> Translator's note: lateral means horizontal
[3:25:54] <worldbrand> It's, you know, like animal crossing progression. Nothing does anything but you want everything.
[3:26:01] <jorgen57> @JazzyJulZ maybe some tutorial will help me oneday but anyway thanks for the talk man.

[3:26:04] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat could one up it, could have downard progression ala all guns being worse then starter in Anthem
[3:26:09] <dsauce999> if (Lateral == horizontal) return true;
[3:26:11] <%NWR_James> Sea of Thieves isn't an MMO. It's a pirate toybox. It's a fun thing to do with friends

[3:27:33] <%TheShal> What's worse? BIOWARE MADE AN MMO BEFORE. They should KNOW how to GAAS.
[3:27:34] <Ion_Laser> The only good thing about Anthem is that Live-Action trailer by Neil Blomkamp
[3:27:35] <%GarbageNirvana> everquest even
[3:27:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I saw that concept in a game-jam game once

[3:29:45] <alwayspronking> what about Sonic: Dreams Collection
[3:29:46] <%logoth_> and sonic mania
[3:29:48] <%Totally_not_toby> me too pat
[3:29:49] <+Jaysky> Sonic 2-3 & Knuckles are great
[3:29:54] <+Jhylla81> I liked Sonic Adventure 2 when I was younger but I probably would hate it now
[3:29:54] <+gamesasacervix> classic sonic in generations and forces controls like shit
[3:29:55] <Ion_Laser> @GeneralSCPatton yeah
[3:29:56] <%NWR_James> "Sonic Dreams Collection is my favorite"
[3:29:59] <moogleboy1984> the feel of the spindash
[3:30:00] <$renegadehatter> What do you think of that XCOM 2 Voice Pack of you guys?
[3:30:01] <Kratokian> First thing that matters in games
[3:30:02] <dakuman13> LUL
[3:30:02] <@lewdskeletor13> All I know about Sonic is what I’ve heard Paige sing
[3:30:04] <%TheCrispyBoi> 3D sonic is TRASH
[3:30:04] <transporterthesequel> Yeah but for Sonic that's right tho
[3:30:05] <%Dingus_Tickler> Sonic: Dreams Collection is the only good Sonic game to come out for over a decade atpCap
[3:30:05] <%lmybestfriendl> so all the Sonic porn
[3:30:07] <warmnoid> i couldn't stand the controls and physics in generations too
[3:30:07] <StaticSunrise> I feel you, I am that guy, ESPECIALLY with cameras
[3:30:09] <dsauce999> Classic Sonic LUL
[3:30:09] <%TombstoneTTromboners> hey guys

[3:30:23] <@lewdskeletor13> BLUE STREAK
[3:30:28] <+Jhylla81> 2D Sonic is the correct way to Sonic
[3:30:30] <InkyDraconian> SPEEDS BY
[3:30:31] <Delenay> yup
[3:30:33] <%blastazoid26> LUL
[3:30:33] <rexbananas> pats as old as arin
[3:30:34] <%whiskey_wolfe_> It's when Sonic doesn't run backwards on an incline when you take your hands off the controller.
[3:30:34] <InkyDraconian> fuck
[3:30:37] <%Typhaeon> You're right
[3:30:38] <%TheDullaMAN> GOTTA GO FAST
[3:30:38] <SecretAgentPickles> Ya gotta mass that, no?
[3:30:38] <Luvinsus> Ok, I can kinda agree with you
[3:30:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Gotta rev it
[3:30:41] <buffmurffy> one thing a like about generations over the other games is that spindash has its own button
[3:30:41] <ReiDuran> Mania is literally the only good Sonic in fucking forever.
[3:30:46] <%ssjklyco> I was ttalking to some girl about resident evil and when we talked about RE6, I told her I didnt continue it because the controls just felt like a bad touch.
[3:30:48] <SecretAgentPickles> Mash, I mean
[3:30:49] <%logoth_> I agree.
[3:30:51] <Delenay> does not feel like the old games
[3:30:53] <nogameunplayed> I'd love to go fast... but I can't in sonic cause I can't see 3 feet in front of me
[3:30:57] <moogleboy1984> 10000% right
[3:31:04] <%ThePeacefulDream> That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
[3:31:09] <+Fynale> you did
[3:31:09] <+Eclipse_knight_> i loved secret rings but holy fuck those controls
[3:31:11] <%NWR_James> donk luvr
[3:31:12] <Liquid_Dio> you have to press the button multiple times pat
[3:31:13] <%TombstoneTTromboners> Sonic Mania is the best

[3:31:55] <+Jhylla81> Sonic Mania added a move that let you do a medium spin dash by holding down and jump in midair. It was nice for regaining momentum

[3:44:47] <Tisaric> But you can miss them
[3:44:47] <%Totally_not_toby> i think you already missed one in the first area
[3:44:47] <CrimsonFox777> That's correct
[3:44:48] <NeroInfinite> nope they're all over
[3:44:49] <%detsuahxe> They're spread through the floors

[3:45:35] <Graywolf_the_45th> the witch hat's projectile is way better
[3:45:35] <$SleepyMaribo> its useless because later on, enemies are to fast for it to hit anything
[3:45:46] <+PenmanLupine> oh my god that squeak toy sound
[3:45:47] <%logoth_> *dead*
[3:45:55] <+Jaysky> Plus you have the witch hat
[3:45:59] <bloodypurpledog> Big meat
[3:45:59] <Kratokian> Hmmm, I could take three seconds to charge up a beam, or I could just hit them
[3:46:02] <Madnoob23> Charged Brewer's Hat is better
[3:46:04] <+swesterly> You play this on stream and i will gift 3 subs ***
[3:46:05] <SecretAgentPickles> In my experience, it's too difficult to line up a shot
[3:46:05] <%NovaKnightmare> Is this game playable with Mouse and Keyboard?
[3:46:06] <nogameunplayed> besides jumping and collecting circles what do
[3:46:11] <ScrapSentinel> pretty sure pat already missed one in the very first room anyway LUL
[3:46:11] <%TombstoneTTromboners> onward

[3:46:18] <Kratokian> @NovaKnightmare very much so
[3:46:18] <+SolverCODO> I think one of these has one hidden off the ledge of the stage
[3:46:23] <%ThirdWelles> BLAMO
[3:46:24] <Veluren> The memory bits are really tricky to find, there's some that are stupidly well hidden
[3:46:26] <%Totally_not_toby> it can be good for bosses, yeah
[3:46:27] <dsauce999> COLLECTATHONS
[3:46:27] <StarMechV> he got it already
[3:46:31] <ScrapSentinel> Some of these pages took me like 20 minutes to find
[3:46:32] <NeroInfinite> He got the only one in that room @ScrapSentinel
[3:46:32] <%supersmolman> @novaknightmare yeah i think

[3:55:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> right!
[3:55:53] <%CJett92> Thats fine,a lot of people thought that
[3:55:54] <%Dovahthing> Fair opinion
[3:55:54] <+dirtyh4rr1> that's right
[3:55:54] <%skizzuto> I don't blame you
[3:55:55] <Reon1995> PogChamp
[3:55:55] <+seoliart> HE SAID IT
[3:55:56] <OkamiDude15> its a good game sfhOK
[3:55:56] <+Dragoneye77> Imagine being fat and wrong
[3:55:56] <Jack_of_No_Trades> agreed
[3:55:56] <CurrySauseBandit> That's okay cause it's almost true
[3:55:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That's okay, man
[3:55:57] <%Cthulos> that's fair
[3:55:57] <Goo_Ftroop> Me too, and I like Odyssey
[3:55:57] <%Piemen99> WhEre'S tHE MusTaRd
[3:55:57] <%ThatGuyfromMars> no?
[3:55:58] <NumbusPlays> i'm mad Kappa
[3:55:58] <LodiFrostbeard> a lot of people do
[3:55:58] <shotgang86> BLASPHEMY
[3:55:59] <jj_cabo> REE OPINIONS
[3:55:59] <BappoSama> I can understand that.
[3:55:59] <Delenay> this one has a good charm to it as well
[3:55:59] <takiyami> You're not wrong
[3:56:00] <StarMechV> A lot of people say that
[3:56:00] <%Totally_not_toby> im not with you but i can respect it
[3:56:01] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I actually agree
[3:56:01] <jorgen57> you are not wrong
[3:56:01] <Veluren> This game came out around the same time as Oydssey, there was a bit of interfandom fighting over it
[3:56:02] <televisedrevolting> OH SHIT MILDLY WARM TAKE
[3:56:02] <+pr0at> atpCap
[3:56:04] <aeonicvector> Same
[3:56:04] <californaya> Hard disagree. I beat both and Mario is just a better game.
[3:56:04] <shamblerhero> So brave enbDoll
[3:56:05] <thegreenbenis> Nintendrones in bound
[3:56:05] <worldbrand> I wish i did, there's a lot of love, but i can't say the polish is the same
[3:56:05] <SummonerMagno> #BraveTweet
[3:56:05] <Darren716> Odyssey has tight ass controls though
[3:56:06] <+ChaosVulpes> That is a perfectly legitimate thing to say
[3:56:06] <$Kenzo2000> It feels way tighter than Mario
[3:56:08] <prime_name> It's 100% better than sunshine
[3:56:08] <ape_hawk> hat kid and cappy need to have a hat-off
[3:56:08] <Pyrrhus90> both are great
[3:56:09] <%ThirdWelles> Yeah that's totally fine this is a great game.
[3:56:09] <Delenay> marios just mario
[3:56:10] <Prevot> pat with the hot takes
[3:56:10] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s ok people have opinions
[3:56:11] <bloodypurpledog> Thats a fair comparison because hat
[3:56:12] <%yeknomlive> i like the control in this game a lot
[3:56:12] <Rubecks> True lordsSip
[3:56:12] <$HyperionXV> So you're saying A Hat In Time is the number 1 hat based platformer of 2017?
[3:56:13] <pectusumbra> That's fair probably. I think they are enough of different subgeneres that they don't overlap
[3:56:14] <+Dickship> Thus games controls are amazing
[3:56:19] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Don't you mean mary-o?
[3:56:22] <Weeabooninja> I disagree, but this makes me happier, she's cute
[3:56:22] <%DigitalJoshie> it's an opinion why would people be mad?
[3:56:22] <ape_hawk> hat kid actually has a personality
[3:56:23] <%velemi> hat kid swears
[3:56:23] <Hypo_Thermic> <3
[3:56:25] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> mario odyssey is nice and all but infuriating sometimes.
[3:56:26] <dakuman13> I think it's more charming than Odyssey. The ending to Odyssey kinda ruined it for me.
[3:56:29] <%DigitalJoshie> Kappa
[3:56:29] <+Venhammer> This has mod support so it technically has more content than odyssey
[3:56:29] <%Over_ninek> i can see that; Odyssey doesn't even have the tightest controls in a Mario game
[3:56:31] <CurrySauseBandit> Better bosses to
[3:56:31] <Animal_Farm4> Hat child is a better mascot than Red Italian Plumber
[3:56:32] <%VanaSkiller> it satisfies the apatGoblin
[3:56:33] <%Solidus_113> @AngriestPat would you believe me if I told you this game was a Kickstarter made by a small group who really liked Mario Sunshine?
[3:56:33] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat when this game first came out, people were comparing it to Mario odyssey
[3:56:34] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> some of those fuckin moons...
[3:56:36] <+Forente> Hat kid does stunt on mario
[3:56:36] <$Kenzo2000> Hat kid does swear
[3:56:37] <Ominnous> superior hat based combat
[3:56:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> quit being judgey about mmos you fucks
[3:56:40] <HealingMind> Odyssey has better long term platforming speed, but Hat Kid has better flow.
[3:56:42] <shifter33> marios overrated
[3:56:43] <redlight55> i mean you can have both sanic and cappy in this game(if u mod it of course)
[3:56:44] <Kratokian> lol
[3:56:44] <+ChaosVulpes> I like how Pat is wearing the dash hat but never dashes...
[3:56:44] <%supersmolman> mario soul < soulful hat in time
[3:56:44] <shotgang86> but in Mario Odyssey you can be A TREE
[3:56:45] <%GabeSweetMan> We haven't gotten to them but this game has some FUCKIN' HYPE.
[3:56:46] <+Jaysky> Waaaay too many moons
[3:56:47] <%PROUD2beGINGER> But Pat, Mario has nipples
[3:56:47] <Kghaleon> This game isn't as long as Odyssey, you can easily beat it in a weekend
[3:56:47] <danknugglit> But mario has that sweet ass
[3:56:49] <buffmurffy> i agree, some of those moons suck
[3:56:51] <Saltmeisterr> fair
[3:56:51] <Explodincatz> Mario Odyssey shouldnt have been a "Mario" game
[3:56:51] <Prevot> pat's fucking crazy
[3:56:51] <reonome> moons
[3:56:53] <+blewbeary> moons*
[3:56:54] <+Lazyjoules> moons
[3:56:54] <Caidezes> Moons mean nothing in Odyssey.
[3:56:55] <Darren716> How is it too long? You can beat it in 2 days
[3:56:56] <%BallinArbiter> Way more charm
[3:56:57] <dakuman13> Peach is also kind of an asshole
[3:57:00] <%Over_ninek> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[3:57:00] <%FrustratedAF> odyssey is fuckin FAT with content
[3:57:03] <Tisaric> It's just so much better feeling and EVERY time piece actually is fun compared to 75% of the moons being boring as hell
[3:57:05] <Reon1995> I feel that way about Breath Of The Wild.
[3:57:05] <alwayspronking> worth a moon!
[3:57:05] <jorgen57> almost like gear for breakwast should get more jobs
[3:57:07] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Yeah, I'm not gonna meet you on the Length, but yeah.
[3:57:08] <moogleboy1984> Horseshoes
[3:57:10] <dsauce999> 900 Korok SEEDS
[3:57:10] <zedravan> the goblins
[3:57:12] <%DestroyerDJ8> odyssey feels padded
[3:57:14] <Ion_Laser> :p
[3:57:16] <californaya> Man, I'm completely opposite from this. I just wanted to keep going back and doing everything in Odyssey, whereas I beat this and didn't want to touch it again.
[3:57:19] <$Kenzo2000> Once you get all the moons the game just adds hundreds more
[3:57:20] <artoflec> a hundred percenting odyssey is boring because 90% of the moons are boring to get or are filler
[3:57:21] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I think part of the problem is you could actually BUY the stars and moons. And then there were those achievement stars.
[3:57:22] <OkamiDude15> @AngriestPat there are alot of mod stuff for this game with user created levels and also skins for hats and such
[3:57:24] <dakuman13> Yeah this game uses its time better
[3:57:25] <Weeabooninja> The Jumprope moon is such horseshit
[3:57:27] <knyttstories> I got all 999, and I would be fine if there were even more, that game's great

[3:57:56] <%BallinArbiter> This game is super chill
[3:57:57] <Weeabooninja> talk about padding

[4:34:35] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 American Kirb-oss here, been avoiding my problems/projects, due to prior engagements with a friend of mine. Took her to Detective pikachu, and bought her a headphone/mic, so she'd stop putting me on speaker. The best gifts for others are the ones that improve their lives, but more importantly improve yours. Then we went to the city today for some pokemon raid or something, idk. I also bought a flight stick for Ace Combat 7 on an impulse buy. And then I bought Ace Combat when I got home.
