[0:03:07] <Pookiedaexzile> It drowns out our hatred
[0:03:12] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt It's basically equal between your talking and the game's talking, that's what sounds good
[0:03:12] <%valriot> Music in all 3 slaps, except that one song in 3 LUL
[0:03:12] <%DianaTheAscian> who said we have thoughts?

[0:06:09] <%SvenHolgersson> The moral
[0:06:11] <%Nuclearcherries> Damn, Woolie really dropped the ball huh
[0:06:12] <%YakumoYomi> psaSmug
[0:06:13] <%jillpilled> In retrospect the more blasted Green Greens was the better

[0:06:27] <%jillpilled> THAT'S WHAT DID EM IN
[0:06:29] <peachy996> Some were loud as fuck and that made an episode even funnier
[0:06:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Good news it wasn't shit tier, you can actually see shit
[0:06:34] <%Nuclearcherries> I still associate green greens with the old podcast
[0:06:37] <Zeif00> Hard to drop the ball when you weren't aware of it's existance
[0:06:38] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt GO TO THEIR PC, DELETE THEIR FILE, FORCING THEM  TO USE YOUR FILE
[0:06:40] <%Kemmybelle> thats why the channel ended.
[0:06:42] <+Twinmin> you should ask woolie on the podcast if he even knows what that file is
[0:06:43] <godspeedspacebat> man shep runs like he's in b-roll for a laxative commercial
[0:06:43] <+MisterAvry> that's the worst, when you give someone something and are like "use this, it will help everyone including you" and they just DON'T
[0:06:44] <Sotetsu> It's a conspiracy!
[0:06:44] <+teelor32> despite all your rage, you're still a poyo in a cage
[0:06:45] <Dfreddy8> So THE TRUTH FINALLY COMES OUT
[0:06:48] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt but did you use that file?
[0:06:50] <SuperChumps> @PatStaresAt Do you wish they would have changed the ending of the 3rd game with the remaster release?
[0:06:54] <%Takreth> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:06:57] <%CalderGaming> remember this is the not punchy one
[0:06:57] <AlphaRayAllen> NO
[0:07:02] <%Monkeyweed21> is the propostition sex?
[0:07:06] <%X2Eliah> Man I still cannot believe they replaced Emily Wong with Lady Battletits in ME3
[0:07:11] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I enter to you screaming. What happened?
[0:07:13] <%ExpressNode> How do I know?
[0:07:15] <%pokefan9956> is this the girl you punch in 3?
[0:07:16] <%NopeBadguy> if you did it as part of work, then you're a professional audio mixer
[0:07:18] <+ThomasOfTroy> Can you give an example?
[0:07:21] <%LumberjackJack> You can't tell me what to do, Uncle Shepard
[0:07:21] <Pookiedaexzile> No one check
[0:07:22] <%AzureGale> Which ones did you mix
[0:07:23] <%Ranryu692> can you think of one offhand?
[0:07:27] <peachy996> By the way enjoy Emily Wong while you can.
[0:07:30] <+mplay213> salty patrique
[0:07:34] <Sotetsu> Is that why the opening song of CSB is so loud? Woolie still doesn't use it?
[0:07:34] <Profmcstevie> Is woolie fundamentally responsible for the castlesuperbeast music not looping properly then
[0:07:36] <%bread_assassin> @pokefan9956 No, she's someone else.
[0:07:36] <+MillerLowlife> fact checking will ruin this stream
[0:07:40] <peachy996> She uh....she doesn't get a good ending in 3
[0:07:42] <Dunmarkh> @ScreamLord twobestfriendsplay having shit audio mixing
[0:07:42] <%dekkitout> Do they pee in bottles?
[0:07:43] <+MisterAvry> line up, sister, we're all overworked
[0:07:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Theres 2 reporters who look the same and a detective who aslo looks like them
[0:07:49] <%ExpressNode> Does it say edited by Pat in the description?
[0:07:54] <%Monkeyweed21> hey its Jessica Chobot here to get a good review score for ME3
[0:08:05] <%AzureGale> Noted
[0:08:05] <ScreamLord> @Dunmarkh Oh, lol
[0:08:07] <acridpaladin> so thats why the intro was randomly ear peircing
[0:08:15] <%ssjklyco> I'm acttually rewatching Yakuza 4 now
[0:08:15] <+MisterAvry> @dekkitout That's the kind of detail that would seem over the top evil in fiction
[0:08:21] <%DianaTheAscian> did you do any of the souls series lps?
[0:08:30] <AlphaRayAllen> OH OK I BELIEVE YOU
[0:08:31] <FennecZephyr> I think I missed this quest
[0:08:32] <%LumberjackJack> Still can't believe we ended up with Diana Allers instead of Emily Wong in ME3.
[0:08:49] <TourettesPlays> Pat played DS3 and did very well :)
[0:08:49] <jorniev> whose voice is that?
[0:08:53] <$Faustgesicht> Fuck diana chobat

[0:11:18] <%ExpressNode> Oh fuck I forgotten about E3
[0:11:19] <%emperordread> @PatStaresAt I asked if I should reload a save after accidentally hitting the point of no return on last stream. Turns out my last hard save was only 9 hours in. I redid it all anyway, it took 15 hours lol. Now on ME2

[0:12:25] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Is there anything you care about next week during E3? Or is it all fuck it who cares, wait till the thing comes out?
[0:12:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> HE PUNKED ME THROUGH THE 4TH WALL
[0:12:27] <+MisterAvry> Garrus is Turian Woolie
[0:12:28] <%maenos2> female turians are pretty obvious
[0:12:33] <peachy996> Turns out it's not subtle lol
[0:12:36] <DatAsuna> Only in ME3 MP
[0:12:38] <%Reveresao> I do remember that
[0:12:38] <+evbites> what
[0:12:41] <DatAsuna> and the omega DLC
[0:12:43] <%dekkitout> Garrus = Turrian Woolie. Givin out T-passes and shit
[0:12:43] <peachy996> Or maybe it's subtle to him
[0:12:43] <%valriot> The female Turian in ME Andromeda is cool
[0:12:44] <BenLanBen> the one in andromeda is feminine tho, retconned?
[0:12:44] <aiutare47> There is only 1 female turian in all of the main ME games. There is an additional ONE in ME3MP
[0:12:46] <T_Sasquatch> ive only seen one female turian in me3
[0:12:46] <%Nuclearcherries> That's why he's the best
[0:12:47] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Turian tits?
[0:12:55] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt And then in the Omega DLC and Andromeda they make it blatantly obvious
[0:12:56] <%pokefan9956> why does she look permanently sad
[0:12:56] <%LumberjackJack> Yup, we don't start seeing vvomen turians until the ME3 DLC
[0:12:59] <wolfen091> saren is listed as male on wiki
[0:13:02] <DatAsuna> Well the female turian model in ME3 MP is relatively subtle
[0:13:03] <+teelor32> "My Turian friend gave me the pass to say Turian with the n, you can say Turia though"
[0:13:08] <+MisterAvry> they're bird-oids, right?
[0:13:09] <%chance_h> Nah, it's cuz they didn't want to make female models
[0:13:09] <DatAsuna> her powers are crazy tho
[0:13:11] <Wolfstriker121> fem turians are all over the place in me andromida
[0:13:13] <TourettesPlays> @DatAsuna Omega DLC also has the only moment in the entire series where your class can effect the story
[0:13:14] <DatAsuna> poison vanguard
[0:13:14] <jorniev> they have smaller crests
[0:13:16] <%GalacticaPhanto> Thanks Makoto,  stay being a narc
[0:13:19] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Boney-ass thrown boobs
[0:13:26] <$Ziegsy> isnt a turian that metal dish you put soup in?
[0:13:26] <ScreamLord> @LumberjackJack And only in the DLC IIRC
[0:13:28] <%JoshManVGH> *googles female turian* ok sure that's "subtlt"
[0:13:32] <+MisterAvry> thrown boobs lol
[0:13:38] <%X2Eliah> It's a lot of corridors
[0:13:40] <%Garthunox> there's a female turian in the omega dlc btw
[0:13:42] <Pookiedaexzile> I just looked up female Turians in Mass Effect 3 and I hate that game more now
[0:13:42] <aiutare47> thats because Novaria is boring and a maze
[0:13:42] <%LouieRouie> That's funny
[0:13:46] <peachy996> Been having fond memories of M1 all week
[0:13:49] <%X2Eliah> Its many more corridors than anyone ever remembers
[0:13:50] <%Nuclearcherries> Noveria exists
[0:13:53] <TourettesPlays> Space Alien Emily Wong
[0:13:54] <Profmcstevie> The long dull grind of enemies is easy to forget, space quests is cool
[0:13:57] <AlphaRayAllen> Emily Wong is a space alien to some people
[0:13:58] <%knight1210> of course
[0:14:00] <+gmackwreck> it's because Emily is a good girl
[0:14:01] <%JoshManVGH> It's true
[0:14:04] <hippofant> Combat is combat is combat. Every game has combat.
[0:14:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Liara really feeling herself there
[0:14:07] <tranquilturnip> I hope Disco Elysium inspires more Devs to just dump combat
[0:14:08] <Sotetsu> You're making me want to play this again... Did they ease up on the multipleplayer nonsense in ME3?
[0:14:10] <%LumberjackJack> They can be fun, but the memories are in the world and characters
[0:14:15] <peachy996> What the fuck are you doing Liara
[0:14:18] <peachy996> Stop it.
[0:14:18] <+MightyDuckShoes> Did Liara do a little dance?
[0:14:19] <Ipsenscastle> a liar
[0:14:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> Imagine if there had been a TellTale Mass Effect game
[0:14:23] <%Nuclearcherries> Its the strongest stuff in Bioware games. Just talking to people
[0:14:28] <%valriot> Gun more memorable in 2 and 3
[0:14:33] <+evbites> nah shooting is good here
[0:14:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Female Turians in 3 look like that Zero Dawn meme unironically
[0:14:38] <%X2Eliah> Yeah, ME2 has better gameplay feel, and ME3 is just aces.
[0:14:38] <%SirGO0SE> dang already in gameplay?! didnt even see we were live
[0:14:40] <%JoshManVGH> I'm excited to see how 3 plays.
[0:14:41] <tranquilturnip> 2 and 3 feel so much better to actually hold a controller and play
[0:14:42] <TourettesPlays> @Nuclearcherries KOTOR is fun once you get AOE attacks
[0:14:43] <Wolfstriker121> JOKER CROSSEYED?
[0:14:46] <GustauveVIII> only thing i miss in ME1 is infinite gun
[0:14:47] <%SirGO0SE> hows everyone doing Pat and chat?
[0:14:51] <aiutare47> I have to go.
[0:14:53] <T_Sasquatch> Noveria feels like such a classic rpg area

[0:15:05] <Ipsenscastle> stop freezing his balls Pat
[0:15:06] <%LumberjackJack> Because you're the boss? Dunno
[0:15:07] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt There a point in ME3 where you'll talk to an Asari that says she was Liara's "Father" and then SHepard can say "Oh you mean her other mother?" And she gets pissed
[0:15:09] <Angry_Ev1L> you are in bed with big corpo
[0:15:09] <%ssjklyco> Corporal, Corporation, it's all Corp
[0:15:10] <Rei_Dsoto> Because Military?
[0:15:10] <%GarbageNirvana> what do you mean pat corporations are people
[0:15:12] <Covil91> I think the idea is you shouldn't talk like that around your boss?
[0:15:12] <$Wafflum> Legally all Spectres are corporations, helps with the extralegality
[0:15:12] <%X2Eliah> Noveria had so much backtracking
[0:15:13] <Wolfstriker121> best boi
[0:15:15] <%valriot> 3 is a genuine blast to play, especially on repeats where ME1 and 2 can kinda drag and feel samey
[0:15:18] <%Varlinator> He's telling you you have cold balls
[0:15:18] <%Nuclearcherries> @TourettesPlays true, but just speaking to people about what a Star War even is is hype
[0:15:19] <%ironohki> We like Space Carth?
[0:15:20] <%JoshManVGH> NARC INCORPORATED!
[0:15:21] <GustauveVIII> ammo makes the game feel bad
[0:15:23] <Profmcstevie> Maybe that's a paragon thing? I dunno, you're a fucking narc
[0:15:23] <kazubisha> kaidan romance in me3?
[0:15:24] <%animaturgy> ShepardStaresAt
[0:15:27] <%pokefan9956> hi carth
[0:15:29] <Manjove> i really only like Noveria because that classic Tower puzzle that is in every Bioware game
[0:15:32] <+MisterAvry> Sparth
[0:15:32] <DatAsuna> "it's veyr large, sir"
[0:15:41] <DatAsuna> Say renegade stuff to make him racist
[0:15:44] <%maenos2> GO HELL AT ASHLEY MORE
[0:15:50] <DatAsuna> renegade kaidan is weird
[0:15:53] <%ironohki> @MisterAvry Yes.
[0:15:53] <ScreamLord> Carth is slow
[0:15:54] <+MightyDuckShoes> ugh Steam didn't install on my lappy. So just will be looking at this and the bar of 96 gigs slowly filling up supern120TumTum supern120TumTum supern120TumTum
[0:16:01] <%X2Eliah> @Manjove I like that you can straight up just skip it for 100 omgingel
[0:16:03] <Sunstalker> Why is kaiden so quiet? DansGame
[0:16:04] <tranquilturnip> Smug aliens LUL
[0:16:17] <ioci2112> shepard comes back from the dead in me2, he recruits 12 squadmates, he is revived by project lazarus, shepard is literally space jesus
[0:16:17] <+MightyDuckShoes> Speak Up Sir!
[0:16:18] <+MisterAvry> is it me or do their mouths not move enough?
[0:16:27] <Manjove> @Manjove but why tho, the tower puzzle is fun
[0:16:28] <%Garthunox> this is so dope
[0:16:34] <ScreamLord> Music loud, Dialogue low
[0:16:34] <%Garthunox> like this sells kaiden for me
[0:16:36] <aiutare47> @ioci2112 oh god it was 12 wasnt it
[0:16:37] <AlphaRayAllen> I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE MUSIC
[0:16:38] <Pookiedaexzile> There's something so different about Kaiden I can't place it
[0:16:39] <%ironohki> That's crazy all this happened in 26 years.
[0:16:46] <%X2Eliah> yeah the mouths are fucked, it's an old game
[0:16:50] <Pookiedaexzile> He might be apart of some sort of underground
[0:16:53] <TourettesPlays> I always forget that humans have basically achieved Utopia in ME universe
[0:16:53] <%dekkitout> Is Vyrn friend
[0:16:57] <Sunstalker> Sheperd is fine, kaiden is weirdly quiet
[0:17:02] <ScreamLord> Weird humans
[0:17:08] <%Truniron> Truniron subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 
[0:17:09] <deviljhojho_> thats what i want tho
[0:17:09] <chimeraxmachina> He was talking about other species but said “it’s human nature” uhhh
[0:17:09] <peachy996> Vyrn is not friend
[0:17:10] <%X2Eliah> yep
[0:17:11] <T_Sasquatch> yup
[0:17:12] <%walternatorz> what about twileks and star wars @PatStaresAt ?
[0:17:16] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Star Trek is boring. Mass Effect is better Star Trek
[0:17:16] <Zeif00> Extremely fuckable
[0:17:18] <+even_the_yuenglings> volus
[0:17:18] <tranquilturnip> it all goes back to that "bipedal humanoids use tools and therefore get to space" thing
[0:17:19] <ahaegotrigger> YES
[0:17:20] <aiutare47> Theyre the only weird ones really
[0:17:20] <DatAsuna> most sci fi does, partly because IRL actors limit you harder
[0:17:21] <%JoshManVGH> Remember when they "explained" it in TNG?
[0:17:22] <%Ranryu692> doesn't ME also have a reason for that, like Star Trek does
[0:17:22] <Pookiedaexzile> The female Turians take it to far
[0:17:26] <Radioactive_Jam > love those dudes
[0:17:27] <%chance_h> elcor are Kundere's
[0:17:28] <%SWFanatic> and the geth and the collectors
[0:17:30] <%LumberjackJack> If only the rachni were more common in ME3 :/
[0:17:30] <%Monkeyweed21> its why people love Legion
[0:17:31] <%Varlinator> They're ALIEN Aliens
[0:17:32] <AlphaRayAllen> Asari are star trek as fuck
[0:17:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> Accountant dwarves
[0:17:34] <DatAsuna> mass effect gets the benefit of being all CG
[0:17:37] <+MisterAvry> I hope we meet aliens one day so we can get some actual alien perspective
[0:17:38] <Covil91> Hanar just look weird, basically just religious nuts tho
[0:17:39] <%justcallmebobplease> Ferengi-Dorfs: the Volus
[0:17:40] <%THOUTHPAW> its probably easier to animate/rig aliens that are vaguely humanoid too, but the elcor and volus rule
[0:17:40] <$Clarke1010> They address this is the first Mass Effect novel
[0:17:40] <%LumberjackJack> Ooof
[0:17:43] <%Monkeyweed21> more gnomes than dwarves
[0:17:44] <%SWFanatic> its nice to see new ideas other than different skin color humans
[0:17:45] <DatAsuna> That's partly why star wars took off too, more weird puppets
[0:17:50] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> volus are just pat mode ferengi
[0:17:57] <peachy996> They're muppets basically
[0:17:58] <%dekkitout> D:
[0:18:05] <ioci2112> @ioci2112 yeah, if you count dlc it's 12, also the name shepard is pretty obvious
[0:18:08] <tranquilturnip> it boils down to being able to use tools or not, or you're a biofreak like the rachni
[0:18:10] <%THOUTHPAW> makes the new aliens in andromeda even more disappointing
[0:18:12] <TourettesPlays> The aliens in ME have always been way too human, that's one of the aspects of it that makes it a bit weaker than Star Wars or Star Trek
[0:18:16] <peachy996> The Elcor are like Jim Henson's Scifi dreams
[0:18:23] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[0:18:24] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> this is bullshit
[0:18:26] <%Varlinator> He cut... Foot...Loose?
[0:18:32] <%SWFanatic> weird flex but ok
[0:18:32] <+MisterAvry> good fuck that guy
[0:18:33] <%LumberjackJack> That's metal, bro
[0:18:35] <dd44dostivei> ok fuck that guy
[0:18:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Nice shot kid
[0:18:41] <ScreamLord> Scientists say if we ever do meet aliens chances are they'll look absolutely NOTHING like anything on earth. Not even vaguely
[0:18:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Nice
[0:18:42] <filialpails> sellf-defense
[0:18:46] <Meekest> You kicked a guy so hard you snapped his neck? Brutal
[0:18:50] <%jillpilled> Based
[0:18:55] <%Nuclearcherries> King shit
[0:18:55] <Dunmarkh> pretty based
[0:18:57] <+pally_din> Yeah Kaidan has a good outlook ther
[0:18:57] <AlphaRayAllen> If one ass was enough to judge a whole race, I'd love quarians
[0:18:57] <%valriot> KAIDEN IS GOOD
[0:18:58] <%dekkitout> Yep. Not kiss him, please.
[0:18:59] <LluthyY> i love kaidan
[0:18:59] <Ipsenscastle> Kaiden's alright in 1
[0:19:01] <aiutare47> man, I dont remember getting this from Kaiden, he's way cooler to me now. Killed his master in single combat
[0:19:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hes very based
[0:19:04] <%dekkitout> *Now
[0:19:04] <%X2Eliah> Kaidan is honestly a lot less boring than Carth or Jacob
[0:19:04] <auraofdawn> i like him
[0:19:05] <kazubisha> BASED
[0:19:06] <Ipsenscastle> not so much in 2 & 3
[0:19:06] <TourettesPlays> Too bad he's dead meat walking
[0:19:08] <stormhawk9891> Way better than Jacob
[0:19:08] <%Monkeyweed21> its a shame hes oonna die
[0:19:10] <+even_the_yuenglings> wtf kaideb us based?
[0:19:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Shepard: Yeah I once Drowned a guy with my barrier thing, just sunk to the bottom of the pool
[0:19:11] <%LumberjackJack> He's more boring than all the aliens, but he's still alright! Just looks bland too
[0:19:13] <%Varlinator> Imagine if all humans were like fucking Ashley. Urgh
[0:19:14] <ttc_lover> Game is preeetty quite
[0:19:15] <%DianaTheAscian> hes a bit bland but hes alright
[0:19:16] <%Nuclearcherries> Kaidan is  a bisexual king
[0:19:16] <Mattais88> Is he the most reasonable ME character?
[0:19:20] <xeros720> you need to have sex with kaiden for him to be interesting
[0:19:22] <T_Sasquatch> If i had talked to kaiden i wouldve let ashley die. now i feel bad
[0:19:22] <kazubisha> been told that kaidan gets better in 3 ive heard
[0:19:28] <$Faustgesicht> He's super cool, just a hard initial sell
[0:19:33] <ttc_lover> It’s like Kadien is whispering
[0:19:33] <peachy996> Shame he has to die tomorrow
[0:19:35] <TourettesPlays> I bet the L2 implant gives you really bad tinnitus, must suck ass
[0:19:46] <Zeif00> Sheppard gettin that whiff
[0:19:48] <aiutare47> A valid take
[0:19:49] <ttc_lover> Pretty quite game audio
[0:19:49] <jorniev> if you really hated Ashley you would save her just to kill her later
[0:19:53] <%THOUTHPAW> i had a better appreciation of kaiden after ten years but i still picked ashley over him
[0:19:54] <+MisterAvry> that's mature as hell
[0:19:54] <AlphaRayAllen> Point taken
[0:19:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Kaiden is Lawful good
[0:19:57] <%DianaTheAscian> fair
[0:19:59] <xeros720> he passed the buck though
[0:20:00] <+ThomasOfTroy> Kaidan is boring, but super reasonable
[0:20:01] <%jillpilled> Space Carth's grown on me looking back but he's still too bland oatmeal to live
[0:20:03] <%Nuclearcherries> Kaidan is pro-genocide
[0:20:07] <TourettesPlays> @ttc_lover thats just kaidens VA lol
[0:20:08] <+even_the_yuenglings> hes from vancouver
[0:20:11] <%dekkitout> Pepperidge Farm was there
[0:20:11] <SaltyAzteca> oh yeah you didnt talk to the council LUL
[0:20:11] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I hate Kadien
[0:20:12] <BlueLunecy> Kaidan's biggest thing really is just being a reasonable person
[0:20:15] <%Ranryu692> I dunno, that almost makes it better that you handled it
[0:20:15] <%skeleklng> KAIDAN IS AN ULTRALIBERAL
[0:20:17] <tranquilturnip> Kaiden is like stereotype main character backup
[0:20:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I dont remember Kaiden being this based
[0:20:18] <AlphaRayAllen> Dr Boobwas
[0:20:19] <T_Sasquatch> i dont know why i but when i played blind i didnt know where the crew was so i didnt get to actually talk to them after every mission
[0:20:22] <+MisterAvry> Kaidan probably has EXCELLENT credit
[0:20:23] <Ardailec> Did he boil the rachni?
[0:20:25] <%CalderGaming> yeah but you're a spectre, the council implicitly approves of whatever you do
[0:20:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> The most important and valuable answer you can give sometimes is "I don't know"
[0:20:26] <%LumberjackJack> Don't go recreating Starship Troopers now, y'hear?!
[0:20:27] <%strugglepunk2> Kaiden is always super reasonable, but that leaves not a lot of room for a personality
[0:20:28] <$realm_forge> HE’S SO MUCH BETTER THAN ASHLEY
[0:20:29] <+Politepies> "They weren't there and they dont got my big DICK"
[0:20:29] <ScreamLord> @TourettesPlays Migranes usually coincide with tinnitus so...probably?
[0:20:30] <peachy996> It's REALLY satisfying to shoot Ashley as a renegade. She dies insulting you
[0:20:31] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> BEST GIRL
[0:20:35] <%pokefan9956> is kaiden a neoliberal?
[0:20:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Keeping it tight, Babe
[0:20:42] <+RJay80> I Gotta Get In There!
[0:20:42] <TourettesPlays> @SaltyAzteca the virgin hanging up on the council vs the chad not calling them at all
[0:20:43] <+even_the_yuenglings> best girl

[0:28:25] <%Nuclearcherries> HE GOT WHAT HE DESERVED *BLAM*
[0:28:28] <%JoshManVGH> So Benedict Arnold and Nazi Quisling.
[0:28:28] <+fetrigon> @quigley_plays OMEGALUL
[0:28:29] <+ThomasOfTroy> Ashley's family did fucked over by stigma though, as you'll see in a minute
[0:28:29] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I feel bad for her
[0:28:30] <Manjove> its almost like she has a reason for believing what she believes
[0:28:31] <battlexqueen> same thing
[0:28:31] <%zyberion626> your grandfather surrendered. Arnold and Quisling were traitots
[0:28:31] <Solvari> Human Power. Human Supremacy
[0:28:31] <%chance_h> oh no, we lost a simple skirmish. Better purge all xenos
[0:28:33] <%MidnightBurst12> oh
[0:28:33] <%X2Eliah> So Ashley is super irrational
[0:28:34] <%Raikouija> So she’s Cerberus scum
[0:28:38] <$realm_forge> I’m surprised Ashley doesn’t have a confederate flag over her area of the ship
[0:28:41] <+tigerfang86> Y E S
[0:28:41] <+Bogart4321> lol
[0:28:45] <%dekkitout> What about grappler mains?
[0:28:45] <%king_wragles> Perpatrators?
[0:28:45] <signofzeta> except for the nazis themselves
[0:28:46] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, growing up with everyone, EVERYONE, calling your family trash because a general surrendered a battle will fuck you up
[0:28:49] <%zyberion626> collaborators are to be shot
[0:28:49] <+ThomasOfTroy> Her granddad is considered a collaborator though
[0:28:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Dis bitch sucks
[0:28:53] <%emperordread> What about Chamberlain the Appeaser? He sucked too (in hindishgt)
[0:28:53] <knight_verse> Literally not the same thing, don't know why you are making the comparison.
[0:28:54] <scrimscromble> say 'he got what he deseeerved' and really rub her face in it
[0:28:54] <+fatalguerrero> It is as her grandfather made the best option at the moment
[0:29:00] <ostermox> Ashley is literally saying that she won't let her FAMILY NAME be Quisling and the only human to surrender to aliens. Nothing else XD
[0:29:03] <+MisterAvry> wow they were using irons in the space future?
[0:29:06] <%maenos2> BITTER
[0:29:06] <Solvari> Dude right, that's hilarious considering that she hates you working with Cerberus in ME2
[0:29:06] <DatAsuna> swtor has a similar thing with collaborators on balmorra, both factions say fuck em
[0:29:07] <%twistedj3ster> strung him up on a lamp post
[0:29:11] <%justcallmebobplease> HEY DON'T SHIT ON CONSTRUCTION WORK ASHLEY YOU CLASSIST

[0:29:23] <+even_the_yuenglings> COLONY DROPS
[0:29:28] <AlphaRayAllen> You can't zone that's cheating
[0:29:30] <+MisterAvry> so she's racist AND classist
[0:29:31] <ttc_lover> Please turn the voice back up like you did before, Ashley is whispering at Shepard
[0:29:32] <+tigerfang86> oh god how DARE they demote him
[0:29:33] <%AncelDeLambert> wow, sounds like the turians were monsters
[0:29:34] <aiutare47> The Turians wouldve fucking dusted Shanxi with their fleet, it was a garden world, what was he supposed to do? Try and fight a completely alien race with better tech only to get more civilians killed?
[0:29:35] <peachy996> Hey I'll shit on Construction work it sucks
[0:29:35] <%justcallmebobplease> I wasn't the only one hearing some turned-up-nose tone in how she said 'doing construction work', right?
[0:29:35] <%JoshManVGH> But... isn't surrender to save your people a nobel act?
[0:29:39] <+evbites> he made the right call

[0:30:27] <Latija> does she know which wire is the red one?
[0:30:27] <+teelor32> so you don't care about legacy, yet you're doing this for your grandfather and carrying out racism? what the fuck are you saying lady?
[0:30:28] <%SvenHolgersson> "Ashley about how flammable are you"
[0:30:28] <TourettesPlays> opinion "from the head" from Alenko sounds really gay shepard

[0:30:29] <scrimscromble> wow and shes hilarious too
[0:30:31] <%AFellowDegen> I honestly think saving her lets u fuck her over way more than  letting her save herself
[0:30:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I NEED TO TAKE A BULLET SARGENT

[0:30:36] <peachy996> Disappointing but I understand the temptation to kill her now rather than later
[0:30:37] <%JoshManVGH> "I need you to meet me in the Airlock for some... alone time"
[0:30:42] <AlphaRayAllen> OH NO
[0:30:43] <%NopeBadguy> time to kill her then

[0:30:53] <%Birdigalore> Wrex
[0:30:54] <Srthunda> I still hate her
[0:30:58] <ioci2112> I mean her family probably fed her that shit during her childhood, so she's just repeating the stupid shit  she heard growing up, that doesn't excuse the racism, but it does explain it
[0:30:59] <%dekkitout> BASED
[0:31:02] <%AncelDeLambert> Quad up
[0:31:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Can we hug Wrex
[0:31:04] <%LumberjackJack> Funny how she's talking about not being the next Arnold and Pat plans on making her do just that in ME3 LUL
[0:31:04] <+SlagChambers> She can never love anything more then she loves racism

[0:31:24] <%LumberjackJack> Wrex is a hero in my heart <3
[0:31:26] <+fatalguerrero> Shepard

[0:31:34] <$realm_forge> God Wrex is just Space Plague
[0:31:40] <Meekest> Kiss this weird space dinosaur on the mouth
[0:31:41] <%dekkitout> Wrex really hits a certain way
[0:31:45] <+MisterAvry> Four On The Floor is not a hero, guys
[0:31:48] <+nomad390> It’s so weird hearing Shepard’s voice come out of buff Pats mouth
[0:31:49] <Solvari> the mass "this is not what I said" effect
[0:31:55] <%CalderGaming> @JoshManVGH maybe, but not in the earth-first mentality that prevailed in the alliance military at the time and that Ashley has bought into
[0:31:57] <%castlerock42> Feel like as a merc, you get to pick who your enemies are.
[0:31:58] <Wolfstriker121> LOL
[0:31:59] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Wrex needs a hug

[0:32:10] <ScreamLord> Turians are infamous for their overkill tactics. I wouldn't surprised if a Turian Exterminators solution for a gopher infestation would be to throw a grenade down the holes
[0:32:12] <%YakumoYomi> Goddamnit...just let me play as a krogan in the next ME
[0:32:14] <peachy996> Hey now don't make a Turian blush
[0:32:18] <aiutare47> Also cool to see Wrexs arc, from suppressing the urge to help the Krogan, to uniting them for the first time in thousands of years
[0:32:23] <Latija> i sure hope saren doesn't show up on a goblin glider
[0:32:29] <%FutaSnek> S U C C

[0:33:24] <+nomad390> Correct me if I’m wrong, but doesn’t Ashley change her views if you follow through on her arc?
[0:33:25] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Forgot how much of a boy scout Garrus sounds in ME1
[0:33:32] <Wolfstriker121> NO MEANS NO GARRUS!

[0:33:39] <DatAsuna> just give garrus a handjob and he'll calm down

[0:35:27] <%JoshManVGH> The fine line between Wrex and Garus seems to be Wrexs veneer of indifference towards murder and violence. Where as Garrus is almost lusting after it.

[0:35:52] <jorniev> what?
[0:35:55] <+MisterAvry> God I love her accent
[0:35:57] <AlphaRayAllen> Yes Tali I will marry you
[0:35:58] <hat_under_bread> I've got sume human juice for Tali
[0:35:59] <spongeofmystery> You personally could finance a bunch of hitmen now
[0:36:03] <TourettesPlays> Now you can go thru the entire of ME2 without collecting credits
[0:36:05] <%luftraumm1> geth dongles
[0:36:18] <%cvp5127> just a little genocide
[0:36:18] <wolverinewaswrong> "understand"
[0:36:20] <peachy996> "also let me steal some specs of the normandy"
[0:36:22] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt make sure you're capped on money before the end of the game, you now carry over 10% of you're total credits on your save, so going into ME2 with 1 mil is a real benefit
[0:36:24] <%SvenHolgersson> Tali's voice is just *chef's kiss*
[0:36:32] <%LumberjackJack> What's tragic is that the data is implied to what happens in her loyalty mission in ME2 :'(
[0:36:38] <%Monkeyweed21> WE NEED TO LEARN WHERE THEIR CHILDREN LIVE SO WE CAN BOMB IT
[0:36:40] <%X2Eliah> Yeah, if you have 7 million or above, in ME2 it imports 700k, which is enough to buy everything
[0:36:48] <+tigerfang86> insight on how to MURDER
[0:36:59] <wolverinewaswrong> helping the quarians research some genocide
[0:37:03] <AlphaRayAllen> ON YOUR KNEES

[0:37:24] <TourettesPlays> @X2Eliah credits dont carry from ME2 to ME3 presumably it was all donated to Batarian orphans and widows
[0:37:25] <aiutare47> Too creepy?
[0:37:26] <%dekkitout> Take your time finding Sarren, got it
[0:37:26] <wolverinewaswrong> COUGH ON THE QUARIANS
[0:37:32] <Meekest> Ashley is literally pro genocide
[0:37:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Woah now, Be gentale with the Qurussy

[0:37:43] <spongeofmystery> Tali, the genocide apologist
[0:37:44] <DracaenaLeaf> yeahh.....
[0:37:44] <Profmcstevie> Only cos we never asked
[0:37:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Tali changes tho
[0:37:45] <tranquilturnip> Ashely is absolutely pro genoside
[0:37:46] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> fair
[0:37:47] <DatAsuna> Ashley never says anything against killing all the geth
[0:37:48] <%jillpilled> She totally is with the geth
[0:37:49] <RaidenRising> really ? another cruella?
[0:37:51] <%Nuclearcherries> Kinda goes hand in hand doesn't it
[0:37:51] <%AFellowDegen> Tali is such a fricken racist
[0:37:55] <%weissguard> psaWink psaWink psaWink psaWink psaWink

[0:37:56] <kazubisha> she doesnt really. understand the geth are more than just. robots
[0:37:56] <Broken_Sonex> @AlphaRayAllen NO UNCLE RAY!
[0:37:57] <xeros720> you ashley lovers make a lot of assumptions about what she talks to her superior officer about
[0:37:57] <%cvp5127> ashley is humanity first
[0:37:57] <%DianaTheAscian> WAIT SHE IS THOUGH
[0:37:57] <%SvenHolgersson> If she lives long enough she 10000000% is down with alien genocide
[0:37:58] <+RoByte2> "I can't tell the aliens from the animals"
[0:37:59] <%skeleklng> you think ashley has a #humanlivesmatter sticker somewhere
[0:38:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Ashley is super pro kill all aliens b
[0:38:01] <tranquilturnip> ask her what she thinks of the Krogan, or the Rachni
[0:38:04] <%JoshManVGH> Elmo!
[0:38:07] <TourettesPlays> Ashley watches Old Yeller and laughs really hard
[0:38:07] <peachy996> That's pretty much the lesson of Mass Effect. Everyone is filled with assholes
[0:38:09] <%SvenHolgersson> Kill her now before she gets even more racist
[0:38:09] <+even_the_yuenglings> she shitposts under the alias " hugh mann"
[0:38:14] <FeralFozzie> elmo is here! life has meaning again!
[0:38:15] <%maenos2> @RaidenRising What you don't want to see how else dalmatians fucked her life up?
[0:38:16] <+tigerfang86> LMAO
[0:38:17] <%luftraumm1> the tali legion Interaction is  the best
[0:38:21] <Wolfstriker121> THERE  YOU GO
[0:38:23] <%jillpilled> LUL
[0:38:23] <aiutare47> THATS FAIR THOUGH
[0:38:23] <wasteless40800> psaBlep
[0:38:24] <T_Sasquatch> I WOULD TOO
[0:38:25] <AlphaRayAllen> btfo
[0:38:26] <Meekest> Ashley will really learn to integrate with the aliens as space dust
[0:38:26] <%LouieRouie> One rachni
[0:38:27] <+tigerfang86> lmaooooooooo
[0:38:27] <+Bogart4321> rachni arn't people :P
[0:38:28] <T_Sasquatch> fuck the rachni
[0:38:29] <%DianaTheAscian> YEAH
[0:38:29] <wolverinewaswrong> Wrex is also pro rachni genocide
[0:38:30] <%JoshManVGH> That's a big genocide right there
[0:38:31] <SaltyAzteca> isnt that different?
[0:38:31] <$realm_forge> Unlike Ashley though, tali gets better
[0:38:33] <+Bogart4321> but yes genocide
[0:38:33] <%ironohki> Tough but fair
[0:38:34] <%LumberjackJack> Ashley apologists in chat
[0:38:34] <tranquilturnip> and back in the bin she goes
[0:38:35] <+ThomasOfTroy> To be fair, almost everyone in the ME universe says that
[0:38:35] <Wolfstriker121> STOP DEFENDING ASH shes evil lol
[0:38:36] <TourettesPlays> Yea but the Rachni already got genocided so to her doing it a second time really means nothing
[0:38:39] <wolverinewaswrong> that's half the party that's pro genocide lol
[0:38:42] <SaltyAzteca> Rachni are stigmatized to be spoopy
[0:38:43] <Wolfstriker121> ash to be purged
[0:38:48] <%THOUTHPAW> you know what fair
[0:38:48] <+itsgundamu> Ash simps in chat
[0:38:51] <%WutangchickeN> But pat it's not genocide if you don't think they're people.  It's just extermination at that point LUL
[0:38:53] <TheAnimeTiger> wrex is also pro geno
[0:38:59] <jorniev> she IS pro genocide then
[0:39:01] <aiutare47> It's kinda weird that you can just let the Rachni go with little trouble at all, they were so bad the Turians went to war with Humanity just for maybe running the risk of bringing them back. They were a legitimate threat to all of council space, even the protheans couldnt kill them all
[0:39:01] <ioci2112> one guy in me3 thinks the rachni were so agressive in the past because the leviathans tried to use them to create an anti reaper army, and the rachni queen talks about oily shadows in me1, so something fucky was going on for sure
[0:39:04] <%kyh9> Ash is made for taking bullets to the head
[0:39:05] <%THOUTHPAW> everyone in mass effect is pretty racist
[0:39:09] <%AncelDeLambert> the Rachni almost went out of their way to panic every other race in the galaxy
[0:39:11] <Pookiedaexzile> "Sentient Speaking race" isn't people. Is not a solid arguement
[0:39:21] <T_Sasquatch> @SaltyAzteca yea its not like those murdering posion spitting insects that will murder anyone if they dont have a queen
[0:39:23] <lurkerletum> I mean if you don't consider the Rachni equal to people then is it really genocide?
[0:39:29] <%Monkeyweed21> you forgot to ask Wrex, Garrus, and Tali about the Rachni @PatStaresAt
[0:39:35] <peachy996> Chohe

[0:41:22] <%Agami23> mass effect is the dot//hack of the 360 generation

[0:42:22] <%AFellowDegen> why would u f a racist though?
[0:42:24] <%NopeBadguy> isnt tali like a teenager
[0:42:24] <dd44dostivei> she's kind of has teenager vibes here
[0:42:25] <%illtima> man, I don't even remember what you can use credits on in ME2
[0:42:27] <%RetroCop87> Wait, you can't bang Tali in the 1st game!?
[0:42:27] <%BioHunter> heres some hindsight, they shouldve made tali romavable for femshep
[0:42:28] <Pookiedaexzile> QURUSSSSSSSSSSY
[0:42:28] <ahaegotrigger> they gave her the biggest hips and the sexiest model
[0:42:30] <%ironohki> If you fucked Tali without Mordin's advice, everyone would have had a bad time.
[0:42:31] <Mattais88> Should have let Jack be Bi
[0:42:31] <tranquilturnip> I can't believe they didn't think people would be interested
[0:42:31] <%dekkitout> Isn't she like on her maiden voyage in this game, aka she's barely legal?
[0:42:32] <AlphaRayAllen> And Wrex ever
[0:42:33] <%AncelDeLambert> Cowardware
[0:42:33] <%LumberjackJack> As much as a I love Tali, I think the timing of the romance was better in ME2

[0:42:44] <thefranchise00> LUL
[0:42:47] <AdamLon4> Garrus, Gay Kaidan and Tali shouldve all been romanceable
[0:42:48] <karl_rex> Both
[0:42:51] <awalbaru> I guess that was a nice strategy for people to buy Mass Effect 2 LUL
[0:42:53] <%NopeBadguy> i live in the south, people fuck racists all the time

[0:42:54] <%bevyrage> is tali a more tolerable racist than ashley?
[0:42:57] <AdamLon4> One of miranda or jack shouldve been bi ngl
[0:42:57] <%AFellowDegen> Both
[0:42:57] <+Bogart4321> garrus
[0:42:58] <nuane> Tali's racism against geth is excusable because she's hot
[0:42:58] <+even_the_yuenglings> tali hates synths
[0:43:00] <tranquilturnip> with her digerido ass
[0:43:04] <%Treuan> Now that you mention it space racism is rampant
[0:43:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Tali doesn't know better, Ashley is a bitch
[0:43:06] <%RetroCop87> Miranda's not a racist, she was born INTO the racisim
[0:43:07] <thefranchise00> like that's how it gets passed on
[0:43:09] <%Ranryu692> there are a lot of racists in Mass Effect lol
[0:43:10] <peachy996> Miranda isn't really racist imo
[0:43:10] <%kyh9> How old is Tali in ME1?
[0:43:10] <%emperordread> can't be racist against a machine

[0:43:19] <%NocturneNovember> Synths ain't people so it's cool
[0:43:19] <%luftraumm1> mingle the genes
[0:43:20] <%SvenHolgersson> And is a good person
[0:43:20] <+smuggleruncle> fuck the racism outta them
[0:43:21] <+DracosMagala> I wanted to bang Kasumi but nooooooo..... LUL
[0:43:24] <%MidnightBurst12> miranda's existance is racist
[0:43:25] <%ItalianWaifu> all fuckable women are reasicts except Jack
[0:43:25] <TungstenViper> wouldn't that create a new spawn?
[0:43:25] <peachy996> But she is the genetic ubermensch
[0:43:26] <%BigCoffee> @nuane it also is ebcause it happened 300y in the back and clearly none of the quarians know what actually happened anymore
[0:43:28] <%SvenHolgersson> Ashley just right out the GATE swinging
[0:43:29] <tranquilturnip> Miranda is basically a human, raised to be a robot, trying to relearn how to be a human'
[0:43:29] <%AFellowDegen> hate fuck them. I see
[0:43:29] <%DianaTheAscian> you can say you nutted in a alien
[0:43:29] <%WutangchickeN> INSERT SEED GET ACHIEVEMENT
[0:43:30] <%Mr_Pylon> but which one is the magic racist?
[0:43:31] <+Bogart4321> getting you're nut is always the answer
[0:43:31] <Meekest> Yeah fuck the weird lady version of your space ship
[0:43:32] <%NopeBadguy> i feel like nutting inside a quarian would kill them instant
[0:43:34] <%NopeBadguy> instantly
[0:43:35] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> JUDGEMENT NUT
[0:43:37] <Basch71> nut the racism out of her
[0:43:37] <peachy996> So safe to say she was crated BY a racist
[0:43:39] <Broken_Sonex> I mean Miranda didn't seem all that racist @PatStaresAt
[0:43:42] <acridpaladin> yea but racists dont deserve nuts
[0:43:46] <tranquilturnip> Hot Evil
[0:43:48] <nuane> I can fix her
[0:43:49] <ioci2112> jack just really hates cerberus, which begs the question of why cerberus wants us to recruit her, but ok
[0:43:49] <%kyh9> It’s weirder that you can’t fuck Garrus in ME1.  Tali doesn’t know any better but Garrus is pretty familiar with the universe and people
[0:43:50] <+smuggleruncle> "oh shepard that was so good im no longer racist"
[0:43:50] <Profmcstevie> ....spite nut?
[0:43:55] <%valriot> Give Tali that !TOXIC! nut
[0:43:57] <+TonyFights> @smuggleruncle if only that worked irl
[0:43:58] <ScreamLord> Too be fair, Tali doesn't know the Geth's side of the story at all
[0:43:59] <%NopeBadguy> i feel like nutting inside a quarian would kill them instantly
[0:44:00] <%NateyBeak> thats like half of seinfeld
[0:44:00] <peachy996> Where they play Chess
[0:44:02] <%dekkitout> Getting the dick wet supersedes morals sometimes
[0:44:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Tali gets a pass, her racism is versus a race hers created and made a culture around hating
[0:44:04] <+teelor32> Hot + Evil = Morally Grey
[0:44:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I remember that episode
[0:44:06] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Like that one guy says "Fuck her right in the pussy"
[0:44:07] <%MidnightBurst12> "my dick will cure the racism"
[0:44:09] <%RetroCop87> People describe Ashley as only being surface-level rascist like that's not already fucking horrible
[0:44:09] <%X2Eliah> Pat you can boost you know
[0:44:11] <+dante_must_die_exe> but that's still nut
[0:44:11] <+Bogart4321> that racist sex is selfish sex
[0:44:12] <ttc_lover> Pat nooooooo
[0:44:14] <awalbaru> Yea
[0:44:14] <+Gespens> just be sure to wear a condom
[0:44:16] <%BigCoffee> half of seinfeld is racism and sexism
[0:44:16] <acridpaladin> pogonaLUL
[0:44:17] <Manjove> i wish the ME 1 remaster was sold seperately, its the only one i want
[0:44:17] <+dante_must_die_exe> and racist nut bad
[0:44:21] <%Treuan> Well if there's one thing I'm good at it's doing it fast and unsatisfying
[0:44:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> congrats pat you got to the top
[0:44:23] <%Garthunox> "I can fix them"
[0:44:25] <AlphaRayAllen> Sometimes, racists actively seek the nut they hate
[0:44:28] <Solvari> just push the racism out of her
[0:44:28] <AlphaRayAllen> Humans are complex
[0:44:28] <AdamLon4> Mass Effect 4 should have character customization extend t races so you can nut the racism out of someone literally
[0:44:30] <@Mechz71> @PatStaresAt good content so far Pat
[0:44:32] <%NocturneNovember> Now I'm remembering that whole "Reven-genics" talk from the podcast a few months ago
[0:44:36] <+senfood> Call them a loser afterwards.
[0:44:36] <%FutaSnek> THE DAY PAT BEAT RACISM
[0:44:37] <peachy996> What happens on this world again?
[0:44:38] <%dekkitout> @AlphaRayAllen 💯
[0:44:39] <TungstenViper> "Let my seed cure your racism and let it remember you why you cannot feel love"
[0:44:40] <%DianaTheAscian> but then what about your satisfaction?
[0:44:41] <%thotbane> how many planets has he done
[0:44:43] <karl_rex> No wonder they never let Shepard drive after 1. Everyone drives the Mako over mountains
[0:44:43] <%emperordread> "Everyone's a little bit racist" though, then humanity would never get their nuts
[0:44:48] <$dalmek> now I've got the term "racially insensitive nut" in my brain
[0:44:48] <hat_under_bread> Sometimes you need to give a kid from the deep south who has been taught to be racist their entire life a little bit of time to adjust before judging their character.
[0:44:50] <Pookiedaexzile> I mean, Chat is Right, You know who isn't racist in the slighteest

[0:44:57] <Solvari> monkaS ?
[0:44:58] <awalbaru> monkaS
[0:45:01] <Manjove> Ashley isnt even a real rascist, she considers Tali like a little sister
[0:45:02] <%RetroCop87> psaHoldon
[0:45:05] <%NocturneNovember> sniff
[0:45:06] <%FutaSnek> Didnt pause monkaS
[0:45:08] <Mattais88> I want a threasher maw to show up while pats not there
[0:45:09] <+Bogart4321> speaking of nut...
[0:45:09] <%shurtal> the mako sounds like a snorty zangief
[0:45:10] <%NateyBeak> THE FINAL NUT LEFT
[0:45:10] <peachy996> Mako panting like a dog
[0:45:11] <%MidnightBurst12> uh oh
[0:45:11] <tanarath> @screamlord she openly denies their rights multiple times and argues for genocide in 3 at the finale of rannoch
[0:45:13] <ScreamLord> Too be fair, Tali doesn't know the Geth's side of the story at all and when she does she actually does grow to like the Geth
[0:45:20] <kylejburke> everything in tali's culture is about how much the geth fucked the quarians over, it's not surprising she hates them
[0:45:23] <%RetroCop87> Is... is the vehicle breathing?
[0:45:24] <@Mechz71> Who's sniffin' in chat
[0:45:29] <+RJay80> axialJigglyWha
[0:45:30] <%thotbane> @Manjove I can't be racist some of my crew are racist
[0:45:31] <%warpath1911> Lol being racist is okay if you're Tali
[0:45:32] <%AzureGale> Watch a thresher maw attack the mako now
[0:45:33] <BerryliciousDefinition> What is that sound??
[0:45:34] <AlphaRayAllen> Paige, is that you?
[0:45:38] <+TonyFights> who isnt racist in me trilogy? the reapers?
[0:45:39] <Meekest> Ashley gets worse over the course of these games somehow
[0:45:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah....but Jack tho
[0:45:40] <%Monkeyweed21> @NateyBeak MY FINAL HAMON, TAKE IT BLANKET!
[0:45:43] <BerryliciousDefinition> Is someone tearing pieces of paper?
[0:45:44] <%emperordread> I've only played ME1, can't imagine why I wouldn't kill all Geth
[0:45:44] <%NopeBadguy> what the fuck happened
[0:45:47] <%Ranryu692> Ashley is more racist by way of paranoia
[0:45:50] <AlphaRayAllen> Sick
[0:45:51] <%FutaSnek> fun
[0:45:52] <%X2Eliah> Oh yeah great
[0:45:57] <%dekkitout> You sure it wasn't an actual mouse
[0:45:57] <Pookiedaexzile> She aint Racist, and she'll fuck you for fun
[0:45:57] <BerryliciousDefinition> ew
[0:45:57] <%ssjklyco> Before he ate it
[0:45:59] <%MidnightBurst12> nice
[0:46:00] <retrosadness> being racist is not just wishin for the death of all other races yall. racism can be a lot subtler
[0:46:00] <%X2Eliah> Now Gief is going to eat that hairball
[0:46:03] <%DianaTheAscian> ew
[0:46:04] <%RetroCop87> he's not throwing up, he's sharing with his brother
[0:46:06] <%Gogogolem> You are Unworthy of the nut!
[0:46:12] <nuane> @Ranryu692 so normal racism then?
[0:46:16] <%OrangeMDT> why do cats love hairballs...
[0:46:17] <%THOUTHPAW> everyone in mass effect is so racist that even grunt is racist and he's basically a child
[0:46:18] <%skeleklng> If you don't wanna pay $60+ dollars for the Legendary Edition, you can get EA play for $15 and immediately cancel it to play it.
[0:46:22] <%thotbane> Wait what why is surveying minerals the door unlock minigame?
[0:46:24] <%LumberjackJack> Tali is super racist in ME1 and most of ME2, absolutely, but has great development once Legion is in the picture. Makes her an amazing character growth-wise when she favors peace by ME3
[0:46:31] <%DianaTheAscian> would he try to? @PatStaresAt
[0:46:33] <%SvenHolgersson> Mako is so fucking relaxing man
[0:46:35] <+TonyFights> unworthy of da nut
[0:46:36] <peachy996> Jack for as crass as she comes off has one of the better romance path imo
[0:46:37] <%SvenHolgersson> I love these parts
[0:46:39] <%X2Eliah> I mean in like veery stream this week we've seen / heard Gief eating elmo's hair out of carpets and whatnot
[0:46:43] <peachy996> Less about sex and more about emotions
[0:46:46] <tranquilturnip> yeah can I get a whole Mako game thanks
[0:46:50] <%ironohki> I didn't hate the mako
[0:46:56] <Manjove> @Manjove part of her character growth is losing her persecutions complex and her hate of aliens (which is more a hate of theAlliance just transposed onto aliens)
[0:47:01] <%jillpilled> @thouthpaw granted it makes sense since Grunt was imprinted with some racism gene from Dr. Okeer
[0:47:05] <%warpath1911> I love the Mako

[1:00:05] <%pokefan9956> EMLO

[1:00:24] <+even_the_yuenglings> ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL
[1:00:38] <peachy996> I can't wait for Harbinger's dorky ass
[1:00:44] <%FutaSnek> TAKE
[1:00:44] <%NateyBeak> I like this bit
[1:00:45] <%FutaSnek> CONTROLL
[1:00:45] <kazubisha> I SHALL AMEND THIS PERSONALLY
[1:00:46] <peachy996> I can't wait for 2
[1:00:48] <heartlesshealer> =)
[1:00:50] <James_Quivers> This hurts me more than it hurts you, Shepard
[1:00:51] <%valriot> Harbringer is so good though LUL hes so fuckin evil
[1:00:52] <%X2Eliah> myeah :(
[1:00:52] <CanadianAdam> how far in is he?
[1:00:53] <%LumberjackJack> ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL DURING SEXY TIMES, SHEPARD. THIS HURTS YOU
[1:00:55] <$dalmek> Shepherd, I have gotten you the knockoff PS2 game. This hurts you
[1:00:56] <ape_hawk> "assuming direct control of DEEZ NUTS!"
[1:00:57] <%Rumbutt> ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL
[1:00:58] <+pmtriox> harbinger isn't even in 3 really
[1:01:01] <ioci2112> the idea is that a billion year old intelligence acts like a 14 year old getting mad in csgo will never stop being hilarious to me
[1:01:02] <RetributionP> harbinger is super fun tho
[1:01:02] <+fatalguerrero> Adjust  partner  AI
[1:01:05] <aiutare47> I AM THE HARBINGER OF YOUR DESTRUCTION
[1:01:06] <%bassoontyphoon> Are you planning on playing dbd for the new RE update???
[1:01:09] <%pokefan9956> so Drake bell amirite
[1:01:11] <James_Quivers> He can only talk to you thru bugs, makes it way less intimidating
[1:01:13] <%Mekhet09> I'm still pissed that playing a biotic none of your powers ever get factored into a cutscene. I guess it was too much work.
[1:01:14] <%JoshManVGH> Remeber the space baby?
[1:01:18] <+StrikeTheErf> that is only because sovereign got clapped before he could keep talking
[1:01:18] <CanadianAdam> soveriegn rules
[1:01:18] <%NateyBeak> The Reapers plan is just a galactic gender reveal party
[1:01:19] <Ipsenscastle> the reaper harbinger is called Sovereign and the reaper leader is called Harbinger :(
[1:01:20] <%NocturneNovember> Harby sucks, not as cool a voice as Sovereign
[1:01:21] <jorniev> OH MAN I think the collectors are better than the others
[1:01:22] <%jillpilled> It almost couldn't be done man
[1:01:25] <ape_hawk> "took me 15 tries, sir"
[1:01:27] <%warpath1911> very nice lol
[1:01:27] <%Arweynn> neither did we
[1:01:32] <%AFellowDegen> Shepard. I'm spreading your VI. This hurts you
[1:01:38] <heartlesshealer> "ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL." Then makes you romance Ashley
[1:01:39] <%zyberion626> Hackett sucking that dick
[1:01:39] <Rei_Dsoto> HSCheers
[1:01:40] <%MrBorisMakarov> YOU ARE CREDIT TO TEAM
[1:01:42] <SaltyAzteca> THANKS SHEPHERD
[1:01:42] <retrosadness> i really hate the phaser they put on hacketts voice
[1:01:42] <peachy996> There's a Reaper worse than Harby at least and it's in 3
[1:01:45] <CanadianAdam> Sovereign talks down to you like he should while Harbinger is like a whiney bitch
[1:01:47] <ScreamLord> Emphasis on "Couldn't let"
[1:01:49] <%templar010> GOD YOUR SOLDIER DICK SO BIG SHEPHARD
[1:01:50] <$Faustgesicht> Genuinely curious how many are just gonna bail watching at the ending?
[1:01:51] <SiameseSneeze> racking up a lot of debt, sir
[1:01:53] <+pmtriox> so why are you still being goodie goodie if you maxed it out?
[1:01:55] <+StrikeTheErf> give sovereign 5 more minutes, he'd be talking calling you a wiener over the radio
[1:01:56] <peachy996> I don't even think it's an actual Reaper
[1:02:17] <ape_hawk> you think if shepard does a good enough job, the alliance will throw him a pizza party?
[1:02:20] <CanadianAdam> IRL volus plays mass effect
[1:02:28] <%FutaSnek> GOD I FUCKING LOVE THIS GAMES OST
[1:02:31] <digaogrunge> Harbinger assumes direct control, hes cooler
[1:02:31] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt Did you do X57 yet?
[1:02:42] <%X2Eliah> not yet
[1:02:44] <+pmtriox> ooh i hate this planet
[1:02:50] <$Faustgesicht> @ape_hawk yes, the Citadel DLC
[1:02:50] <ScreamLord> @peachy996 You mean the Destroyer you fight on Rannoch?
[1:02:53] <+pmtriox> save dude
[1:02:55] <%templar010> Cool
[1:03:02] <%RetroCop87> just realized, this is Star Fox 64 all range mode
[1:03:03] <peachy996> yeah that loser
[1:03:04] <%JoshManVGH> @ape_hawk Isn't that what the Citadel DLC in 3 ultimately is?
[1:03:07] <+even_the_yuenglings> li~ara ara
[1:03:16] <nuane> @ape_hawk yes, but he has to give a slice to every crewmember of the Normandy and there only one pie
[1:03:33] <%RetroCop87> right
[1:03:36] <%JoshManVGH> Yep
[1:03:36] <aiutare47> y3es
[1:03:37] <%AFellowDegen> @even_the_yuenglings ... this makes me feel some kinda way
[1:03:37] <spongeofmystery> waaaah, Ontario
[1:03:40] <PirateMike_> Its one of those OST that I can't hear outside the game without getting sad that i'll never be able to experience it for the first time
[1:03:44] <%Maids4lyfe> Jacob doesn't get a slice because he cheats
[1:03:49] <SiameseSneeze> smellmo
[1:04:00] <fugly_nick> Is there any reason to do all these side planets?
[1:04:00] <Rei_Dsoto> Cat
[1:04:04] <%X2Eliah> man, fuck Jacob
[1:04:15] <%Nuclearcherries> Cash money
[1:04:15] <%X2Eliah> @fugly_nick ya, quests
[1:04:23] <SiameseSneeze> Jacob actually shit tier next to Ashley
[1:04:29] <ape_hawk> BECAUSE CONTENT
[1:04:30] <CanadianAdam> XP points are tasty
[1:04:32] <%JoshManVGH> Stuff and thing's
[1:04:32] <PirateMike_> Whos the jar jar binks of Mass Effect?
[1:04:32] <fugly_nick> Fair enough
[1:04:38] <ape_hawk> MUST CONSUME CONTENT IN VID GAM
[1:04:44] <+Alopekis> Is the music audio janky for anyone else?
[1:04:44] <seancbo> @PirateMike_ Chobot in 3
[1:04:45] <%Kitafin> all the sidequests
[1:04:45] <%Nuclearcherries> @PirateMike_ Ashley
[1:04:49] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt any new David Cage news today?
[1:04:51] <peachy996> If Ash is at the bottom, Jacob is right behind her
[1:04:55] <%X2Eliah> Here's the thing about Jacob. Every single thing he suggests or advises in ME2 is dead wrong.
[1:04:56] <%JoshManVGH> @piratemike_ Ashley
[1:05:09] <%Mathochism> @PirateMike_ There really isn't a comic relief character.
[1:05:11] <T_Sasquatch> @PirateMike_ despite the memes , no one is that bad
[1:05:18] <+Alopekis> Jacob means well
[1:05:19] <James_Quivers> BUT THE PRIIIIIIIZE
[1:05:21] <%StaceMcGate> but the priiiiiize
[1:05:25] <fugly_nick> Jacob cheats on you after you romance him
[1:05:27] <%warpath1911> If you dont do every quest in the game you arent getting your moneys worth
[1:05:29] <Dunmarkh> @Alopekis no
[1:05:30] <@CreepyPorpoise> but the priiiiize, Pat
[1:05:31] <%cvp5127> hes just there
[1:05:32] <srv4254> he has a big head
[1:05:32] <Meekest> DOES Ashley get better
[1:05:32] <+even_the_yuenglings> THE PRIZE
[1:05:33] <+Alopekis> I neither like nor dislike Jacob
[1:05:33] <Minorou> Jacob's not bad
[1:05:33] <dd44dostivei> jacob is black sex object
[1:05:34] <%LumberjackJack> Remember when Jacob advised to vent Legion out the airlock?
[1:05:35] <CanadianAdam> if you romance jacob HE LEAVES YOU and gets another woman pregnant
[1:05:36] <+SinnerEbru> because no one'w fave is Jacob
[1:05:36] <%THOUTHPAW> jacob is just boring
[1:05:37] <kazubisha> jacobs writing is horribly racist too
[1:05:38] <%Daxalog> Jacob is which one?
[1:05:39] <%bread_assassin> Jacob cheats on you if you romance him.
[1:05:40] <%Mathochism> Can we talk about how Thane is the best?
[1:05:40] <%jillpilled> the priiiiize
[1:05:41] <T_Sasquatch> tfw the only black dude in your party is lame ... sigh
[1:05:43] <+SinnerEbru> no one stabs Jacob
[1:05:43] <%AzureGale> Jacob gets worse
[1:05:44] <%Monkeyweed21> at least Ashley isnt a racist stereotype herself
[1:05:44] <Broken_Sonex> BUT THE PRIIIIIIIZE
[1:05:44] <%emperordread> I like Jacob for the 2 hours I've been playing ME2
[1:05:45] <AngryAsian5> No clue what Kasumi sees in him LUL
[1:05:46] <PinkSocks> Jacob and James just feel pointless
[1:05:46] <seancbo> I like Jabobs loyalty quest ok. His dad is kinda interesting
[1:05:50] <+GobbleLynn> Really? I like Jacob more than Kaiden tbh
[1:05:52] <+BigChiefBear> i just tried to be jacobs friend and he wouldnt stop trying to fuck me
[1:05:52] <+OG_M_Bison> That's racist Pat Kappa
[1:05:53] <%Maids4lyfe> the worst is Jacob starts barely okay, and HE GETS WORSE
[1:05:53] <%Mekhet09> Jacob was kind of fine. I liked his subquest in which his father was a scumbag.
[1:05:54] <%MidnightBurst12> jacob was a mistake
[1:05:55] <PirateMike_> @T_Sasquatch I suppose you're right.
[1:05:56] <peachy996> I lik Jacob's Sidemission because of how awful is Dad is, but I feel nothing for ol Jacob
[1:06:00] <%JoshManVGH> Someone revealed that he gets defacto worst as the games go on, yesterday.
[1:06:01] <DatAsuna> jacob gets worse
[1:06:04] <ioci2112> all human squadmates (except jack) are solidly at the bottom of the list, but jacob is the worst
[1:06:04] <SiameseSneeze> I fucking hate how every line femshep says to Jacob sounds like she's flirting with him, at least, from what I remember
[1:06:08] <%LumberjackJack> @AngryAsian5 The priiiiiiiiiize
[1:06:09] <%Mr_Pylon> I love Grunt
[1:06:09] <Oak_bogle> @patstaresat have you already done mystical orb quest you get from Massage lady?
[1:06:14] <%Mathochism> The correct party is Mordin, Thane, and Legion.
[1:06:15] <srv4254> 2 cast is the best by far
[1:06:16] <%QueequegTheater> Every charactr except Jacob is great
[1:06:17] <%StaceMcGate> and mostly human in ME 3
[1:06:19] <+even_the_yuenglings> its pretty big
[1:06:20] <Ipsenscastle> even Jacob's loyalty mission would be just as good without him on it, the fact that the guy is his father is completely irrelevant to the mission's coolness, and he has nothing interesting to say about it
[1:06:22] <%Mekhet09> Who's worse then Jacob or Kaiden? I like Kaiden but he's boring.
[1:06:25] <peachy996> NOBODY from 2 SHOWS UP IN 3 and I hate it
[1:06:26] <SaltyAzteca> it HURTS that its so small
[1:06:29] <LluthyY> im pretty indifferent about jacob lol, dont hate him but dont particularily like him either
[1:06:30] <%valriot> Cast list is about 7 in 3
[1:06:33] <tanarath> They rushed
[1:06:33] <DatAsuna> Liam in andromeda is INSUFFERABLE but he's a more interesting character than jacob
[1:06:33] <karl_rex> Its baffling that they replaced so much of the cast of 2 with what is mostly the cast of 1 for 3
[1:06:33] <peachy996> Besides Garrus and Tali
[1:06:38] <%X2Eliah> ME3 cast list is not that small, it's more than ME1
[1:06:41] <%DJFakie> They wanted to deep dive character stories in 3 instead of 12 passovers from 2
[1:06:43] <stantheman_97> i don't remember anything about him particularly bad but i haven't played it since i was like 15
[1:06:48] <James_Quivers> The other characters who aren't on the squad anymore still get nice solid appearances tho
[1:06:49] <%X2Eliah> unless you kill everyone in 2
[1:06:49] <peachy996> I hate Liam so much
[1:06:50] <+Alopekis> @peachy996 Shepard does
[1:06:50] <%Monkeyweed21> You cant go into ME3 with NO party members
[1:06:51] <DatAsuna> that and time constraints
[1:06:52] <PinkSocks> @peachy996 they all show up lol theyre just not party members
[1:06:52] <Ipsenscastle> at least Thane got something cool
[1:06:53] <+Bogart4321> save the gief
[1:06:55] <%THOUTHPAW> both kaiden and jacob are boring, but there's some really racist undertones to jacob's loyalty mission that rub me the wrong way
[1:06:55] <fugly_nick> ME1 is 6, I think ME3 is 7
[1:06:55] <ScreamLord> We don't even get a Krogan in ME3
[1:06:56] <DatAsuna> ME3 was very rushed
[1:07:00] <%skeleklng> Not only that but if anybody from 2 dies you get a stand-in for your party that's the same race
[1:07:00] <%Eilocke> why do you have maximum money?
[1:07:01] <%Mekhet09> @DatAsuna Who's not insufferable in that game though?
[1:07:06] <+OG_M_Bison> James was a waste of space tho
[1:07:07] <%Daxalog> At his point do you just give the other party members super mods?
[1:07:08] <tanarath> @peachy996 besides cameos, yeah.
[1:07:08] <James_Quivers> Also, Javik is worth like 4 of the ME2 cast ALONE
[1:07:11] <+Slattsquatch> Gotta love the unfortunate implications that the sole black crewmate in the whole trilogy is the only one that straight up cheats on you
[1:07:13] <James_Quivers> He's amazing
[1:07:16] <T_Sasquatch> EDI is the BEST
[1:07:21] <%Ranryu692> what??
[1:07:21] <%jillpilled> LUL
[1:07:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> HOW DARE
[1:07:22] <%valriot> 3 has Garrus, Tali, EDI, James, Kaiden/Ashely, Liara and JAVIK
[1:07:22] <SaltyAzteca> ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
[1:07:22] <James_Quivers> And mordina nd legion
[1:07:23] <%DJFakie> No, that dude's wrong
[1:07:23] <peachy996> Yeah
[1:07:23] <+pally_din> No that's bullshit
[1:07:24] <Solvari> what really now
[1:07:24] <aiutare47> wait what?
[1:07:24] <AdamLon4> 3 cast was limited also because of just limited production time, I'm sure if they had the time they could've implemented a few more companions
[1:07:24] <thelonechris> Blali and Blarrus
[1:07:24] <+Bogart4321> oh yea...
[1:07:24] <+OG_M_Bison> No Garrus doesn't get replaced
[1:07:26] <%Mekhet09> Seriously? I don't believe that.
[1:07:27] <%cvp5127> discount tali and garrus
[1:07:27] <CanadianAdam> you don't get fake Garrus but you get fake Tali
[1:07:28] <%DianaTheAscian> WHAT
[1:07:28] <jorniev> yes
[1:07:28] <karl_rex> Fake AI Legion too
[1:07:29] <%X2Eliah> uh... huh. I don't recally seeing that
[1:07:30] <%bread_assassin> They don't join the party though.
[1:07:31] <peachy996> Fake Mordin is actually really cool
[1:07:32] <%ironohki> Technically possible to not get Garrus.
[1:07:32] <+OG_M_Bison> Tali gets replaced for 1 mission
[1:07:32] <%AFellowDegen> EDI is HOT
[1:07:32] <moonmeh> that dudes wrong
[1:07:32] <+D00msDayDan> holy shit
[1:07:32] <SiameseSneeze> lies
[1:07:32] <%Daxalog> Grunt?
[1:07:34] <CanadianAdam> And fake Legion and fake Mordin
[1:07:35] <LluthyY> really??
[1:07:35] <%LumberjackJack> No, they're NPC replacements in their missions, but not companions
[1:07:35] <+Alopekis> That sounds very untrue
[1:07:35] <rekinom> kmart tali
[1:07:36] <ioci2112> nah, they just don't show up in me3 if they die in me2
[1:07:38] <%valriot> For specific missions
[1:07:38] <tanarath> @patstaresat fake mordin too
[1:07:39] <James_Quivers> and they ALL SUCK BECAUSE THEY AREN'T THE REAL ARTICLE
[1:07:40] <+even_the_yuenglings> you get a quarian admiral
[1:07:42] <Ipsenscastle> that would actually be cool
[1:07:45] <Zalapski> there's fake mordin for sure
[1:07:47] <SiameseSneeze> oh
[1:07:48] <aiutare47> ohhhhhhh
[1:07:49] <$Faustgesicht> Nope
[1:07:50] <%ArchimerCXV> my favourite part of ME2 is that you get legion so late that if he's your only available party member who needs a loyalty mission they delay the collector attack on the ship so you can still go immediately after being invaded.
[1:07:52] <dd44dostivei> fake mordin is pretty cool
[1:07:57] <peachy996> Fake Mordin is the best fake
[1:07:58] <moonmeh> fake mordin is cool
[1:07:59] <aiutare47> yeah and it DRASTICALLY changes things in 3
[1:08:01] <fugly_nick> I got Not Mordin in my playthrough
[1:08:03] <peachy996> Padok Wiks
[1:08:03] <+StrikeTheErf> Wreav also exists
[1:08:05] <TourettesPlays> @Zalapski Maelon is actually a pretty fun character in his own right
[1:08:08] <%X2Eliah> Yeah like doing a mission on tuchanka is still a thing even if wrex is dead
[1:08:09] <+OG_M_Bison> THEY LITERALLY REPLACE LEGION WITH LEGION 2.0 THO @PatStaresAt
[1:08:10] <James_Quivers> Fake Mordin is cool, fake legion is an EVIL ASSHOLE
[1:08:15] <Mattais88> Kirahhe as fake Thane too
[1:08:18] <%X2Eliah> But ofc that mission goes differently then
[1:08:20] <+even_the_yuenglings> thats what I got because my tali died in the suicide mission
[1:08:20] <%Monkeyweed21> so when you do the Quarian Homeworld you get a generic Quarian with you @PatStaresAt
[1:08:24] <T_Sasquatch> @OG_M_Bison WE ARE NOT LEGION
[1:08:25] <kazubisha> fake mordin will never be mordin
[1:08:29] <moonmeh> fake mordin actually is so different that its worth having a playthrough with him
[1:08:32] <HirsuteBrute> it's sad that you get Legion so late in the game, he's great
[1:08:32] <%DJFakie> Mordin's protege from 2 replaces him in 3, he doesn't do a good job
[1:08:33] <%warpath1911> Fake Legion hurts
[1:08:33] <%castlerock42> You can't do the warlord. It's renegade only.
[1:08:39] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat certain interactions in ME3 have less-than-desirable outcomes if certain members of the ME2 team are deceased or never encountered
[1:08:41] <%valriot> Its a weird issue with ME2 doing what it did, it didnt make sense when there was another game on the way LUL
[1:08:47] <acridpaladin> I gotta ask. Is legion in ME3?
[1:08:47] <+OG_M_Bison> @T_Sasquatch HE LITERALLY HAS THE N7 ARMOR SHOULDER
[1:08:50] <+OG_M_Bison> LUL
[1:08:50] <%X2Eliah> uhhh
[1:08:52] <+NerevaRising> not home at the moment lol
[1:08:53] <%JoshManVGH> Do they ever adequately explain the "birth of a reaper" bullshit from 2?
[1:08:54] <%AFellowDegen> Has
[1:08:54] <%X2Eliah> this is odd
[1:08:55] <+OG_M_Bison> Yes
[1:09:00] <%shurtal> this is a job for google
[1:09:02] <%Ninestempest> Ninestempest subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months! 
[1:09:02] <+OG_M_Bison> @acridpaladin Yes
[1:09:05] <%AFellowDegen> pat mdone the special orb yet?
[1:09:07] <%LumberjackJack> Oh shit, I think this is the "Lord Darrius" quest
[1:09:07] <%Garthunox> this is the renegade version of the scientist quest
[1:09:07] <Ipsenscastle> @ArchimerCXV whoa I wondered why the kidnap was delayed when I just replayed it!
[1:09:10] <aiutare47> @JoshManVGH yes and no, not well
[1:09:15] <%castlerock42> Renegade locked.
[1:09:15] <peachy996> Is this not the Renegade Quest?
[1:09:17] <%AFellowDegen> has pat done*
[1:09:18] <Explodincatz> try knocking
[1:09:19] <%Nuclearcherries> Yeah you need a quest
[1:09:20] <+GuilKato> you may need to go empty dog to make door open
[1:09:20] <Jane_Lo> i hated the dude that replaced wrex in me3, he's just boring
[1:09:25] <BlackStarAura> Majority Renegade run required
[1:09:26] <%strakillias> The warlord is a renegade mission. Major kyle is the paragon version i think
[1:09:26] <T_Sasquatch> @OG_M_Bison You ask him and he literally doesnt respond about why he has a holographic n7 armor LUL
[1:09:28] <%Nuclearcherries> ...Don't rember which one
[1:09:30] <Jane_Lo> if wrex is dead*
[1:09:34] <%Mr_Pylon> try Rhetoric to ask the door to open
[1:09:39] <+Lulu19> Nice bald spot
[1:09:40] <+even_the_yuenglings> vega is alright
[1:09:42] <%Monkeyweed21> @JoshManVGH the idea that all of galactic civilization exists soley for 1 super species's reproduction cycle is really cool
[1:09:43] <peachy996> Oh yeah Urdnot Wreav is a horrible person
[1:09:48] <%DJFakie> You can not pick up Garrus and "Archangel" has modified dialogue
[1:09:54] <%bassoontyphoon> Peepee time for gief
[1:09:56] <+GobbleLynn> DIS nut
[1:09:56] <T_Sasquatch> DIS NUTZ ?
[1:09:57] <%Ranryu692> you did Dis, but did you do Dat?
[1:10:00] <peachy996> Urdnot Wreav is why people don't cure the genophag
[1:10:00] <%valriot> To be fair, i think the party members in 3 are better overall than 2, the main stays are great, but Javik is the coolest
[1:10:00] <rekinom> Can do Dis dick gottem
[1:10:09] <fugly_nick> I always forget Garrus is optional in ME1
[1:10:10] <%X2Eliah> yeah you did dis
[1:10:10] <%bread_assassin> ME2 and 3 having the percentage explored for each galaxy is a godsend.
[1:10:15] <@Mechz71> dis dick
[1:10:20] <+OG_M_Bison> Wreave is such a bad person it's justifiable to not cure genophage LUL
[1:10:20] <LluthyY> yeah he is awful
[1:10:21] <James_Quivers> Yeah, Wreave is actually a plot point in that he's such an asshole, you start to doubt if the Krogan can survive under his leadership
[1:10:31] <%bassoontyphoon> Ligma balls
[1:10:41] <TourettesPlays> love how he dies in ME3 if Wrex is still alive, it happens slightly offscreen and no one gives a shit
[1:10:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> drain the dog
[1:10:50] <%JoshManVGH> @monkeyweed21 But then they have the one humanoid proto reaper as the boss. But arent the rest just Sovereign look a likes?
[1:10:51] <Mattais88> Just ,et Reave die and have Eve lead the krogan
[1:10:52] <karl_rex> Its also real bad if you don't do certain missions in 3 companions show up as evil in a certain mission
[1:10:54] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Guys...I miss my dog.
[1:10:54] <Zalapski> I have zero qualms about killing wrex to save mordin in ME3
[1:10:55] <stantheman_97> wreav is like the stereotype of krogan as a person
[1:10:57] <jorniev> MORDIN ACTUALLY SURVIVES IF WREAV IS AROUND
[1:11:01] <%bassoontyphoon> psaHoldon psaHoldon
[1:11:21] <Zalapski> @jorniev bingo
[1:11:24] <BlackStarAura> There was the Quarian Reaper too
[1:11:26] <TourettesPlays> Its also sad that Eve doesn't get along with Wreav at all
[1:11:39] <BlackStarAura> On Rannoch
[1:11:46] <Zalapski> mordin > wrex sorry everyone
[1:11:52] <ioci2112> you can convince mordin to stop if you killed wrex in me1 and didn't use maleon's data in me2, so eve dies, he just says the krogan will just repeat the same mistake and fucks off
[1:11:57] <%warpath1911> Mordin only survives if you convince him not to cure the genophage
[1:12:00] <%Monkeyweed21> @JoshManVGH yea thats where it kinda fails, though I think they later retcon it that the sovereign shape is their shell based on their creators, and within each Reaper is unique based on the genetic data used to build them
[1:12:02] <fugly_nick> I wanna do a playthrough where everyone in ME2 dies and gets replaced
[1:12:03] <jbrowning134> Pats brb music reminds me of the Home Depot song
[1:12:12] <%warpath1911> doesnt matter if its wrex or wreav
[1:12:12] <Sunstalker> Mordin chooses what he does. Fuck everybody who shoots wrex
[1:12:17] <peachy996> But I did like Padok Wiks a lot. Just the gif of his face when he's picturing krogan mating
[1:12:24] <%apostateCourier> @warpath1911 Never do that.  Only villains do this.
[1:12:38] <+Alopekis> I wish I was as cool as Pat
[1:12:49] <kazubisha> if u convince mordin to not cure the genophage wrex will know if he's alive but wreav will not so you have to kill wrex in 3 too
[1:13:03] <ioci2112> also wreav never figures out you sabotaged the cure because he's a big dumb idiot, so you get krogan support AND salarian support
[1:13:23] <%warpath1911> @warpath1911 i didnt have the heart... but youtube did
[1:13:38] <Sunstalker> Fuck you if you chose to sabotage the cure kinamaGun
[1:13:42] <peachy996> I think Wreav is shown trying to gather a Krogan Army in the Destroy Ending
[1:13:52] <ZE_Count> Man disco almost killed woolie
[1:13:52] <%valriot> Yeah 3 has some dire outcomes, especially with the Geth, Tali can kill herself
[1:13:55] <peachy996> If you went with him and cured the genophage
[1:14:04] <fugly_nick> I don't wanna sabotage the cure just because I hate the Salarian Dalatrass so much
[1:14:06] <%THOUTHPAW> ill have to watch a renegade playthru of the series bc i could never bring myself to do it myself
[1:14:21] <$Ziegsy> hello chat, we better not be discussing... women rapping in here
[1:14:33] <BlackStarAura> I could never hurt Wrex
[1:14:35] <peachy996> Oh man that's a stacked decision of who you hate more: Urdnot Wreav or Dalatrass Linron
[1:14:40] <%chance_h> Toasters>.jpg waifs
[1:14:42] <peachy996> They're both terrible
[1:15:02] <kazubisha> if you cant convince wrex and also dont kill him in me1 ashley does it for you so. another reason to hate her
[1:15:17] <%warpath1911> Wreav screws it up so bad for the krogan. he almost deserves it
[1:15:38] <%bugz_munny> Ive had enough of your disingenuous assertions
[1:15:54] <%NateyBeak> idk why anyone thirsty for tali when Legion is like, right. there. Im love them.
[1:15:56] <%DianaTheAscian> I hope Pat is right that Tali gets better cause so far I'm not a fan
[1:15:56] <mrslants> Why does pat look like modok?
[1:15:59] <peachy996> The Tuchanka arc is one of the highlights in 3 because of how involved it is
[1:16:05] <%JoshManVGH> @monkeyweed21 Uuugh that's weak. I would have loved to seen a bunch of wild gigantic space weirdos throughout 3.
[1:16:16] <aiutare47> @DianaTheAscian she does, pretty much everyone does
[1:16:24] <%Treuan> It's my good friend no signal
[1:16:24] <peachy996> So many different ways to go about it and who to kill and save
[1:16:25] <+ThomasOfTroy> Eatin sushi
[1:16:27] <jbrowning134> @PatStaresAt Your brb music sounds like the home depot theme
[1:16:28] <%Ranryu692> not much, just watching zombie scat
[1:16:33] <%JoshManVGH> The signal is none
[1:16:34] <%DianaTheAscian> @aiutare47 k

[1:16:34] <%twistedj3ster> dog empty
[1:16:39] <$Ziegsy> no signal best co host
[1:16:40] <%jillpilled> No Signal is our frien
[1:16:44] <%chance_h> No Signal, pog
[1:16:46] <@Mechz71> Just talking to Golden fucking Gaius
[1:16:47] <ioci2112> @kazubisha you give her the signal, also wrex and you were just pointing guns at each other, so not like she shoots him in cold blood out of the blue
[1:16:54] <$Ziegsy> wonder how pat feels being banned from e3 this year, being canadian and all
[1:17:13] <%Monkeyweed21> @JoshManVGH it would be awesome to have boss fights where you go inside a reaper and find some crazy ass Super Synthetic Thresher Maw or  some shit like that
[1:17:13] <peachy996> Gotta clear that Ming up
[1:17:20] <%BigCoffee> No pat, the term canadian is banned at e3
[1:17:24] <Dunmarkh> you don't know pat?
[1:17:26] <kazubisha> @ioci2112 does she? ill be honest i totally forgot about that i never kill wrex in my playthroughs so i watched it on youtube

[1:17:57] <%Eilocke> that is impossible and i don't believe it but it's probably true
[1:17:58] <fugly_nick> This could have been a podcast discussion
[1:17:58] <%skeleklng> THOSE GODDAMN C*NADIANS
[1:17:58] <%emperordread> Canada fucked around and found out
[1:18:00] <+SweepTheLegoMyEggo> the french?
[1:18:03] <+D00msDayDan> it's become a word southerners use to describe white people they don't like or something
[1:18:04] <%AncelDeLambert> psaCanada ZUT ALOR! psaCanada
[1:18:04] <$Ziegsy> I cant post links ;;
[1:18:05] <%X2Eliah> ..... wtf?
[1:18:08] <%MugenSandan> Canadian has become co-opted by internet racists so they can speak hate about Black People
[1:18:08] <Zeif00> OMG ITS TRUEEE
[1:18:09] <%zyberion626> apparently Canadian is being used as a term for black people @patstaresat
[1:18:09] <comicalmond9135> WHERE'S THE PROOF
[1:18:09] <%Monkeyweed21> @JoshManVGH IMAGINE AN ELCOR REAPER OR A HANAR REAPER THAT WOULD BE SO COOL
[1:18:12] <%AncelDeLambert> MERDE!
[1:18:15] <%chance_h> Canadians are part French that’s why
[1:18:15] <%captain_thickthighs> Because you can't decide. If your French or english
[1:18:17] <DracaenaLeaf> Canada is banned for the same reason people were upset over the O.K. hand symbol
[1:18:18] <%DJFakie> "woman rapping" is also banned
[1:18:18] <%X2Eliah> Omg
[1:18:22] <blue8moon> first result from a google search
[1:18:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> fucking what
[1:18:25] <TungstenViper> why is the USA so dumb?
[1:18:25] <%JoshManVGH> Why the hell is "Canadian" banned?
[1:18:30] <%X2Eliah> Have Americans decided that "Canadian" is a slur now?
[1:18:30] <peachy996> This is where Banes is I think
[1:18:33] <%bugz_munny> toejam is another banned word
[1:18:34] <AngryAsian5> Could be Wrex... could be...
[1:18:36] <%bugz_munny> fuckin toejam
[1:18:37] <peachy996> Or some dead loser
[1:18:41] <%AncelDeLambert> this all sounds made-up as hell
[1:18:42] <%Eilocke> oh it's just a test list. it's not the actual banned word list, it's for testing code or something
[1:18:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> this sounds like the stupidest shit thats ever happened
[1:18:45] <Daebunz> i went to get dinner, are we done trying to save the scientists
[1:18:49] <+Bogart4321> will probly be fixed as date gets closer
[1:18:50] <Wolfstriker121> WAIT this is legit serious?   this is not trolling right?
[1:18:53] <Wolfstriker121> gonna make me look for it
[1:18:57] <+fetrigon> what that doesn't make any sense?
[1:18:58] <%captain_thickthighs> Did the prime minister cosplay again?
[1:19:00] <%bugz_munny> i just saw it
[1:19:01] <peachy996> Ah Jacob
[1:19:03] <%bugz_munny> its serious
[1:19:03] <%BigCoffee> ***
[1:19:03] <@StridentSong> ESA claimed that Canada and Toejam were just test words while testing the filter. They're not intended to be in the final list
[1:19:04] <$Faustgesicht> Why is E3 so dumb?
[1:19:11] <%AncelDeLambert> shame this is a different Jacob
[1:19:11] <$Ziegsy> google e3 banned list
[1:19:12] <RedPlasticCup> hey, we found one Jacob fan
[1:19:14] <Ipsenscastle> Jacob's brain doesn't function, you heard it here first
[1:19:15] <%X2Eliah> JACOB
[1:19:16] <%DJFakie> “The team working on the E3 portal and app used a sampling of words that came from a third party software company only for the purpose of functionality testing on the portal [...] this is not the final list, only a test list"
[1:19:20] <yojohny> Uh oh, another problem caused by an irrational woman
[1:19:25] <SiameseSneeze> Jacob deserves to be given up on
[1:19:27] <+Alopekis> @StridentSong Okay, that makes way more sense.
[1:19:28] <%AncelDeLambert> he almost sucks as much as SHAAAUUUUUN!
[1:19:29] <TungstenViper> imagine having compeltely safe and harmless words being banned in 2021 LUL
[1:19:32] <%Eilocke> i guess they wanted to test the filter without having to use actual slurs
[1:19:34] <%BigCoffee> @DJFakie fun ruined
[1:19:38] <xbb1024> suc long time
[1:19:40] <%JoshManVGH> Oh test list got it
[1:19:42] <Wolfstriker121> my god E3 WTF MAN
[1:19:48] <Wolfstriker121> i just checked it wtf!!!
[1:19:51] <Ipsenscastle> it's a fun leap in production quality
[1:19:52] <%jillpilled> So these are the long lost Jacob stans
[1:19:58] <RedPlasticCup> BORK
[1:19:58] <%DJFakie> @DJFakie Facts and Logic
[1:19:58] <%JoshManVGH> Thanks for being an experiment, Canada
[1:20:06] <%bugz_munny> we live in a society

[1:20:10] <tanarath> Jacob's me3 mission is ok
[1:20:11] <TungstenViper> @DJFakie oh, ok... that would have been amazing LUL

[1:20:28] <RetributionP> rip jacob
[1:20:31] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, never peak player power right before the ending, it leaves us with no time to enjoy it
[1:20:31] <%LumberjackJack> Shame about Jacob
[1:20:31] <+Alopekis> You basically get the Spectre X weapons for the last mission. It sucks.

[1:21:15] <peachy996> How dare you make Garrus fall
[1:21:17] <s3tok41b4> "we won't tell her until after we let him die" damn that's evil
[1:21:27] <BlackStarAura> BBQ
[1:21:30] <%AncelDeLambert> we are not responsible for some rando without a family

[1:21:39] <+PleasantLee> wow it never clicked how much the IU of this game is like kotor
[1:21:42] <peachy996> What's up with your eyes during Barrier
[1:21:46] <theshillman> i just got here and the first thing i see is a woman getting executed point blank. is this a paige stream?
[1:21:47] <+alphonseisbest> What is this side quest? I've never seen this!
[1:21:51] <+Bogart4321> their family thanks you
[1:21:51] <peachy996> Weird
[1:21:57] <%JoshManVGH> Oh wow, Garrus DIDN'T want to kill someone?!
[1:21:57] <+GuilKato> no it wasn't  that was super wasteful  - his organs are now spoiling
[1:22:06] <%AncelDeLambert> him honk?
[1:22:06] <$Faustgesicht> Ah yes; mercy. After you atomized his mom
[1:22:09] <%DJFakie> He must defeat the toy!
[1:22:12] <$Ziegsy> gief loved jacob
[1:22:12] <+GuilKato> you could have kept him on life support until you got to port  and donated his organs
[1:22:14] <%AncelDeLambert> hork honk honk bork
[1:22:14] <+Bogart4321> the man meat is going bad
[1:22:22] <%king_wragles> Mayhaps his lack of balls? gotem
[1:22:27] <%RetroCop87> BUT WHAT ABOUT jULIE?
[1:22:32] <+Alopekis> @alphonseisbest I'm pretty sure you don't get any guidance to that quest. You just kind of find the ship in the Ming cluster and go to it.
[1:22:36] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You could have donated his organs, quest failed
[1:22:37] <jbrowning134> What a good dog
[1:22:44] <%FutaSnek> Tougangawa Incorporated is displeased with your disposal of this biomort
[1:22:44] <Zalapski> mayhaps by his missing balls
[1:23:01] <+GuilKato> See does Tali tell the quaraian fleet about these abandoned spaceships that can be salvaged for her fleet
[1:23:04] <%WutangchickeN> holy shit the load times might've just sold me on the legendary edition
[1:23:11] <+alphonseisbest> @Alopekis oh, that explains alot I never want system by system

[1:24:49] <%DJFakie> No spoilers, Boo shows up in ME3 Citadel
[1:25:00] <peachy996> Surprised Tali and Liara never talked shop about Chiktikka and Glyph
[1:25:14] <$Futurecity10> 2
[1:25:19] <%JoshManVGH> Glyph?
[1:25:23] <fugly_nick> I'm only just now learning that Tali named her drone
[1:25:26] <$Futurecity10> Then you have to find it in 3
[1:25:28] <peachy996> Although Glyph probably wasn't  combat ready
[1:25:32] <+Alopekis> You'd think Admiral Hackett would have more contacts than just Shepard for missions.
[1:25:32] <peachy996> ME3
[1:25:41] <$Ziegsy> brownside?
[1:25:48] <peachy996> Although it is in LOTSB

[1:26:07] <%DJFakie> I mean, you can let them die for the lulz.
[1:26:08] <+Alopekis> It's mandatory if you want to have fun
[1:26:10] <%X2Eliah> monke?
[1:26:12] <%MrBorisMakarov> I honestly appreciate almost every characters loyalty mission
[1:26:13] <jbrowning134> Is ME3 good overall? I heard the ending is shit, but what about the rest of the game

[1:26:53] <+Alopekis> You can actually beat this mission really quick

[1:26:55] <Zeif00> Banana Slamma
[1:26:59] <%RetroCop87> "w-why did you save me?"
[1:26:59] <Ner234> @Monkeyweed21 You were born for this
[1:27:00] <%bassoontyphoon> Harambes back everyone and he’s pissed
[1:27:02] <BlackStarAura> The monkey is always at the back of the mine
[1:27:03] <%DJFakie> The module is always in the same place BTW
[1:27:04] <Zalapski> usedCGL usedGRL usedCGR
[1:27:05] <peachy996> In Andromeda, they give you a pet Pyjack
[1:27:07] <%LumberjackJack> Rewrite the geth?
[1:27:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> Always hug Tali?
[1:27:08] <%X2Eliah> huh,renegade,really?
[1:27:10] <+Alopekis> Because the monkey with the thing you're looking for is always in the same place.
[1:27:10] <%X2Eliah> uh ok
[1:27:11] <+D00msDayDan> always hug tali
[1:27:12] <kazubisha> does this planet have the pickpocketing cows?

[1:27:18] <%Monkeyweed21> Samara?
[1:27:19] <+StrikeTheErf> renegade slowly shifts from "practical but harsh" to "total maniac"
[1:27:21] <kazubisha> HUG TALI
[1:27:21] <karl_rex> Tali loyalty mission
[1:27:22] <+Shockrates20XX> Samara
[1:27:22] <SiameseSneeze> Creepy scarred uncle PogChamp
[1:27:24] <ioci2112> @jbrowning134 except kai leng, fuck kai leng
[1:27:25] <otakon17> I mean going Renegade in ME2 is decent for a few things because you're dealing with criminals mostly
[1:27:33] <dd44dostivei> do every interrupt
[1:27:35] <otakon17> that's ME3
[1:27:35] <+Phoenon> Looks pretty rough Skyrimming these mountains
[1:27:39] <TourettesPlays> She becomes and ardat yakshi
[1:27:42] <otakon17> also FUCK KAI LENG
[1:27:44] <karl_rex> Morinth straight up dies in 3
[1:27:45] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt She shows up as an enemy Ardat-Yakshi
[1:27:45] <+Shockrates20XX> Picking Morinth is the only legitimately "evil" Renegade choice.
[1:27:45] <sgtbloopface> she does show up in 3 but as a generic enemy, just with the name changed
[1:27:46] <%warpath1911> she is in 3 tho
[1:27:48] <ScreamLord> Picking Morinth is stupid
[1:27:49] <dd44dostivei> always do every interrupt in me2
[1:27:49] <peachy996> Morinth turns into a Banshee in 3
[1:27:49] <otakon17> stupid fucking space ninja bullshit
[1:27:51] <Zalapski> she shows up as a random enemy at the end LUL
[1:27:55] <SaltyAzteca> You can do both
[1:28:03] <GustauveVIII> does pat give any shits about being spoiled in 3 about things he may or may not have read about
[1:28:07] <+Alopekis> No one truly goes full renegade.
[1:28:09] <ahaegotrigger> some of the Renegade Options are just so fucking good LUL
[1:28:13] <$Ziegsy> chat dont feed your dog ice cream. they are lactose intollerant and WILL fart you out og your bedroom
[1:28:14] <TourettesPlays> @otakon17 tfw forgot to warn Miranda about Kai Leng and now shes dead and theres nothing i can do about it
[1:28:14] <peachy996> You only know it's Morinth in 3 by her namplate
[1:28:14] <%DJFakie> Centrists are bad, Pat. Remember Disco Elysium.
[1:28:18] <SaltyAzteca> I will miss the Mako though BibleThump
[1:28:18] <Explodincatz> BotW but link is an ATV
[1:28:19] <kazubisha> all renegade interrupts
[1:28:22] <otakon17> I dunno, I can't help but break that one kids gun to keep him from getting killed in the Archangel raid
[1:28:31] <%skeleklng> If you fug Morinith you literally die
[1:28:32] <otakon17> @TourettesPlays that SUCKS
[1:28:32] <%warpath1911> god kai leng is so stupid
[1:28:34] <heartlesshealer> mordin's great
[1:28:35] <ahaegotrigger> like the one in Thanes Mission where you kill an anti human politician
[1:28:37] <dd44dostivei> yessssssss
[1:28:39] <peachy996> I always push the guy out
[1:28:39] <ape_hawk> "hey dr. warcrimes, hows your day?"
[1:28:40] <%X2Eliah> yeah thats the way
[1:28:41] <%AncelDeLambert> sure are a lot of planets that have developed rooting plants yet have incredibly active tectonic plates and vulcanism
[1:28:41] <%Monkeyweed21> just remember you need to be Max Paragon or Renegade for Tali's loyalty mission @PatStaresAt
[1:28:42] <%AzureGale> That's gonna cost ya
[1:28:43] <%SilverJakler> SilverJakler subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 3 month streak! (Potential ME3 Spoils, read how you will) I'll never forget the time I let Eve die in ME3 because I landed in the wrong place on the correct planet. I got confused cuz the TV was old and the resolution made the text insanely small and unreadable. Oops
[1:28:43] <iosephe> that's right
[1:28:44] <+pally_din> That would be the way to go
[1:28:45] <%DJFakie> That's totally cool!
[1:28:47] <%Rumbutt> Paragon with renegade interrupts in ME2 is solid
[1:28:47] <%donell324> Hey pat ever thought of playing star ocean 3 for the stream
[1:28:47] <dd44dostivei> also shoot kolyat's hostage!
[1:28:48] <%jillpilled> There's not a single bad renegade interrupt in that game
[1:28:49] <+even_the_yuenglings> kai leng is the stupidest
[1:28:50] <AngryAsian5> The renegade interrupts RULE in 2 and even in 3
[1:28:51] <otakon17> otherwise I use REnegade interrupts usually because they're combat pragmatism
[1:28:51] <%jillpilled> Love em
[1:28:51] <+OG_M_Bison> Kai Leng is the WORST
[1:28:52] <%Rumbutt> that's what i do
[1:28:56] <%zyberion626> that's the correct way
[1:28:57] <+RoByte2> It's kinda hard to avoid that one prompt with the gas line and that group of Krogan
[1:28:57] <+OG_M_Bison> Cerberus sucks
[1:28:57] <%UvBenServed> Yeah, headbutt the shit outta that one krogan
[1:28:58] <iosephe> classic ME2 playthrough
[1:28:59] <%MidnightBurst12> that works
[1:29:00] <SaltyAzteca> You gonna renegade interrupt Mordin?
[1:29:01] <+HanbaobaoZaiNar> like the one in Mordin's loyalty quest it just lingers so long and and BEGS you to hit the interrupt
[1:29:02] <%strakillias> Paragon with a bitchy streak is the best
[1:29:02] <heartlesshealer> at least mordin seems honest about his warcrimes
[1:29:02] <+Alopekis> Even the good guys have their limits
[1:29:05] <%bassoontyphoon> That’s the best way
[1:29:06] <otakon17> like making that Krogan catch on fire when they're monologuing
[1:29:06] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Do you need certain levels in Renegade to do those interrupts?
[1:29:07] <James_Quivers> Best way to play ME is to just pick the options you would actually pick IRL
[1:29:07] <+Phoenon> Just a little fucky wucky oopsie LUL

[1:30:08] <ioci2112> all cerberus sucks in me3, the thing is the best parts of me3 are things that were set up in me1 (genophage, quarian/geth) while the things that really suck are the things that came after, really tells you a lot about society

[1:30:57] <%warpath1911> Wait the protheans attacked cavemen?!
[1:31:08] <otakon17> nah, studied cavement
[1:31:17] <+Alopekis> I don't want a caveman cutscene in my space war crime game
[1:31:19] <theshillman> >you will never be abducted by asari and used as a breeding slave

[1:31:46] <%SilverJakler> What's the policy on spoilers here?
[1:31:50] <peachy996> Ah true
[1:31:53] <%AncelDeLambert> uh, no, Shepard, we're going back to the Normandy and you will immediately submit yourself to a full physical from Chakwas
[1:31:54] <otakon17> I love the Turian helmets
[1:31:59] <%DJFakie> Jesus, two planets to go and only 4 levels. Goddamn.
[1:32:03] <%AncelDeLambert> there are babbies in this chat
[1:32:09] <RedPlasticCup> top 10 juiced up krogans
[1:32:12] <%bassoontyphoon> HypeChimp
[1:32:13] <fugly_nick> Oh shit we said a bunch of stuff about 3 already
[1:32:19] <SaltyAzteca> Oh wow Shadow Broker, that was a good DLC
[1:32:26] <%warpath1911> uh oh
[1:32:26] <hippofant> What about Mass Effect 4 spoilers though? calebdACKSHUALLY
[1:32:30] <%templar010> I really hope the MP gets added
[1:32:30] <Ipsenscastle> Oh you didn't do Shadow Broker? That's gonna be a treat
[1:32:32] <JetpackMcQuack> spoilers hot
[1:32:33] <+even_the_yuenglings> 3 is good
[1:32:33] <jbrowning134> How do you mean "a weird place"?
[1:32:35] <kazubisha> shadow broker was the best dlc until citadel
[1:32:35] <%Monkeyweed21> did you know Ashley can kill Wrex?
[1:32:39] <%Rumbutt> So you stopped before the good one
[1:32:39] <srv4254> broker was the good one
[1:32:41] <DatAsuna> in mass effect 3 kaidan pivots weirdly hard to remind you how canadian he is
[1:32:41] <otakon17> oh yeah tell your buddy that Thane is a LIZARD MAN, HE IS A DRY DESERT LIZARD MAN
[1:32:41] <%shurtal> and Lair was FUCKING FANTASTIC
[1:32:41] <fugly_nick> Shadow Broker is like the only good ME2 DLC
[1:32:42] <Radioactive_Jam > shadowbroker was a big step up
[1:32:43] <%AncelDeLambert> the DLC is not good for ANY of the Mass Effect games
[1:32:43] <seancbo> Thats too bad, Shadow Broker is the 1 good one LUL
[1:32:44] <Sp3ctre48> Shadow Broker is the only good one
[1:32:45] <%warpath1911> did you do arrival?
[1:32:46] <%SataruYamate> overlord isnt bad
[1:32:46] <otakon17> the ME2 DLC isn't really great
[1:32:47] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yeah, that was a mistake
[1:32:49] <+BigBruthaThunda> why does shep look so bad in ME3?
[1:32:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Shadow Broker is the good one
[1:32:50] <%BigCoffee> shadow broker is top 3 ME DLC
[1:32:53] <peachy996> Lair is good, Arrival is not good
[1:32:58] <%Maids4lyfe> if you have ME4 spoilers then you're in trouble with Bioware and EA is sending top men to your location
[1:32:58] <SaltyAzteca> wow
[1:32:59] <TourettesPlays> Overlord DLC is so shit
[1:33:00] <otakon17> Shadow Broker is the best due to all the story and the return of Liara
[1:33:02] <heartlesshealer> it was probably good at the time and then dropped sharply
[1:33:02] <kazubisha> @SataruYamate storys really good the hammerhead drags it down
[1:33:03] <%Nuclearcherries> Oh wowo
[1:33:03] <%RetroCop87> Does Andromeda have ANYTHING worth spoiling?
[1:33:04] <James_Quivers> Did you know Fisto the Hanar is a secret party member in ME3?
[1:33:09] <%valriot> Overload is neat, Shadow Broker is great
[1:33:10] <srv4254> oh yeah overlords good
[1:33:11] <$Faustgesicht> Shadow Broker > Overlord > the other one
[1:33:13] <otakon17> @Maids4lyfe top men?
[1:33:13] <%chance_h> I like the dlc party because it was so goofy
[1:33:13] <%BigCoffee> Citadel > Shadow Broker > Bring Down the sky > everything else
[1:33:14] <%MrBorisMakarov> what was the default thing for not doing the bring down the sky dlc
[1:33:15] <%valriot> *Overlord
[1:33:15] <fugly_nick> Overlord would be fine if it weren't for the Hammerhead sections
[1:33:16] <peachy996> Overlord DLC is good for the ending though
[1:33:17] <%AncelDeLambert> all of the DLC either breaks lore, sucks, or is stupid. All of them.
[1:33:22] <+logus313> I liked all the DLC for ME2 🤷♂️
[1:33:22] <%DJFakie> @Maids4lyfe Top men?
[1:33:25] <otakon17> honestly the BEST DLC in the series is Citadel
[1:33:26] <%skeleklng> I would replay ME2 JUST for shadow broker
[1:33:26] <Sp3ctre48> Kasumi's dlc is also worth it but only for the gun you get during it
[1:33:26] <T_Sasquatch> @Maids4lyfe This time they'll just delay and remake the whole game
[1:33:28] <%Maids4lyfe> @otakon17 Top. Men.
[1:33:32] <AlphaRayAllen> Is this Halo?
[1:33:32] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat how do you feel about ME3's conclusion being wholly dependent on a literal score system
[1:33:33] <seancbo> I like Kasumi and Zaeed alright
[1:33:37] <%DJFakie> @otakon17 Thank you
[1:33:38] <%bassoontyphoon> I like Kasumis DLC
[1:33:40] <+Alopekis> Bring Down the Sky is the best DLC in any game
[1:33:42] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[1:33:45] <Ipsenscastle> I seem to remember Bring Down the Sky came out stupidly late
[1:33:48] <ioci2112> the smg you get during kasumi's mission is stupidly broken, I love that shit
[1:33:54] <otakon17> Citadel is SUCH an amazing culmination of the series on whole in ME3 I love it so much.
[1:33:55] <T_Sasquatch> trash
[1:34:08] <$Faustgesicht> Oh shit Arrival is ok
[1:34:11] <moonmeh> yup
[1:34:12] <%AncelDeLambert> it's not hard to achieve, it's just tedious
[1:34:15] <ChungusQuest> Why would you not??
[1:34:16] <peachy996> I think Lviathan is weird lore wise but the locations are great
[1:34:21] <SaltyAzteca> The coop missions were very fun
[1:34:21] <otakon17> because the universe is just THAT engrossing
[1:34:22] <%SilverJakler> I sent a Resub message that could possibly be seen as a ME3 spoiler, kiiiinda? Idk, feel free to read it as you want
[1:34:25] <+D00msDayDan> imagine not doing side content in a RPG
[1:34:26] <otakon17> you WANT to explore
[1:34:27] <SaltyAzteca> I remember that about ME3
[1:34:28] <+even_the_yuenglings> citadel turns me3 into mgs4
[1:34:31] <%valriot> Its the same issue with ME2 suicide mission, nobody beat ME2 with half the party members dead
[1:34:32] <%MrBorisMakarov> ME3MP IS THE SHIT
[1:34:32] <kazubisha> arrival is fine but tedious until you get past the stealth part
[1:34:32] <seancbo> I like Citadel, but the fan service goes over the top for me
[1:34:34] <Ipsenscastle> I played so much multiplayer my galactic readiness was basically immediately maxed
[1:34:34] <T_Sasquatch> i had zero interest in wasting my time getting war assets for a shitty green ending that I violently disagree with
[1:34:34] <%TheotherKristian> Galactic readiness was way too easy, and now progress from your other games now also ccarries over to that readiness, so I've heard
[1:34:35] <karl_rex> Galactic Readiness was only ok because the multiplayer was fun
[1:34:35] <%Maids4lyfe> I like Arrival because you get to kill a lot of Battarians
[1:34:38] <%X2Eliah> Yeah, low galatcic readiness just means you didn't play the game
[1:34:42] <+Alopekis> I still haven't played ANY of the ME2 or 3 DLC, so I'm kind of excited to get to play them now.
[1:34:47] <seancbo> @valriot I did PepeLaugh
[1:34:50] <%LumberjackJack> Fair
[1:34:50] <moonmeh> oh man
[1:34:50] <%Rumbutt> anyone who would really care about how things would affect the ending would have max score, basically
[1:34:51] <otakon17> @MrBorisMakarov AGREED I PLAYED THAT SHIT FOR FIVE HUNDRED HOURS
[1:34:52] <%DJFakie> Roger.
[1:34:55] <fugly_nick> DO NOT SPOIL CITADEL
[1:34:56] <peachy996> Oh.. Well okay I won't
[1:34:57] <%valriot> Citadel DLC is so good
[1:34:58] <%SilverJakler> Okay cool. It's got nothing to do with the Citadel
[1:35:00] <otakon17> the Citadel DLC is GREAT
[1:35:02] <%AzureGale> Yeah that's best going in fresh
[1:35:02] <LluthyY> citadel is sooo good
[1:35:02] <%jillpilled> True Citadel shouldn't be spoiled it's a gem
[1:35:04] <%OldOnyx> didn't it debuff readiness until you you played MP in 3
[1:35:04] <digaogrunge> Citadel is the true ending for fans of the characters, ME3 is good cause of that
[1:35:04] <sgtbloopface> citadel DLC is a real treat
[1:35:05] <SaltyAzteca> Same, I never got into the DLCs, only Shadow Broker
[1:35:08] <+SinnerEbru> citadel dlc fucks
[1:35:09] <%MrBorisMakarov> @otakon17 FURY ADEPT AND GETH SOLDIER GANG
[1:35:09] <moonmeh> its so fun
[1:35:09] <ioci2112> citadel is shepard's loyalty mission, shepard has a personal problem and the whole crew helps him before the big final thing
[1:35:09] <peachy996> Now that I know what not to spoil I won't talk about it
[1:35:10] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt ME3 has a couple of really good DLCs
[1:35:11] <kazubisha> citadel is by and large the best dlc
[1:35:11] <otakon17> BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU DO IT BEFORE PEOPLE DIE
[1:35:18] <seancbo> @OldOnyx Yes, it was idiotic LUL
[1:35:20] <%BigCoffee> Citadel is one of the best DLC's since dlc's exist, period
[1:35:20] <%Monkeyweed21> Drunk Tali is best Tali
[1:35:21] <T_Sasquatch> citadel dlc is the only reason i dont completely hate me3
[1:35:22] <%strakillias> Citadel DLC is the best thing in ME
[1:35:24] <%skeleklng> Citadel DLC is pure fanservice, but in a good way.
[1:35:25] <karl_rex> Monke
[1:35:27] <+fetrigon> you shoot stuff ye KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[1:35:28] <otakon17> @MrBorisMakarov I LOVE the Geth Soldier

[1:35:38] <%logoth_> Do not fight the monkey, even if you fight you CANT WIN
[1:35:39] <$Faustgesicht> There's too much in citadel to spoil effectively
[1:35:39] <otakon17> RETURN THE MONKE
[1:35:41] <karl_rex> hmmm monke
[1:35:42] <+Alopekis> Top
[1:35:42] <%bread_assassin> I think Pat has absorbed like 90% of ME3 through osmosis already.
[1:35:43] <%MidnightBurst12> MONKE

[1:35:46] <+Alopekis> Top middle
[1:35:48] <+Alopekis> In the mine
[1:35:49] <BlackStarAura> MINE
[1:35:49] <+alphonseisbest> TOP
[1:35:50] <%dapperdoop> too many monkeys
[1:35:51] <%valriot> Honestly, most of the backlash that isnt the ending in 3, is just people dont like that its this loud finale despite the fact it kinda has to be
[1:35:51] <Ipsenscastle> top middle
[1:35:54] <%X2Eliah> Idk which one it is, but its the one with the mine
[1:35:54] <+alphonseisbest> THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE
[1:35:55] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Monkeh
[1:35:56] <otakon17> you'll just have to search them all
[1:35:57] <%bassoontyphoon> HypeChimp HypeChimp HypeChimp
[1:35:58] <%Wallabri> psaWink psaWink psaWink
[1:36:05] <+Alopekis> He's all the way in the back. Then you'll get ambushed by some robos
[1:36:07] <otakon17> the ...MONKEY IN THE MIDDLE ?
[1:36:10] <Sp3ctre48> I was never too fond of Citadel but I hope Pat likes it
[1:36:11] <otakon17> also I saw that Elmo
[1:36:18] <%shurtal> did he learn it from you?
[1:36:19] <%skeleklng> It's kinda impossible to spoil the Citadel since all the good bits are just party member interactions. The actual "plot" line is so stupid and silly.
[1:36:30] <SaltyAzteca> NICE
[1:36:31] <AlphaRayAllen> WOOOOOAH
[1:36:32] <seancbo> Pog
[1:36:32] <ChungusQuest> wicked
[1:36:32] <%kujofire990> MONKE FLIP
[1:36:32] <Ipsenscastle> SICK
[1:36:32] <%X2Eliah> YEEEEEE
[1:36:32] <%MrBorisMakarov> THAT WAS RAD
[1:36:33] <otakon17> the plotline is FUN

[1:36:36] <%slimmixrp> Do a kickflip
[1:36:38] <otakon17> SICK SPIN
[1:36:38] <$Faustgesicht> SICK
[1:36:38] <viewtifulr> WICKED
[1:36:38] <LluthyY> sick flips
[1:36:39] <SaltyAzteca> SO HERE I AM
[1:36:40] <dero45> barrel roll pimping
[1:36:40] <otakon17> SOMEONE CLIP THAT
[1:36:43] <%twistedj3ster> "Yo Wrex, check out this sick flip!"
[1:36:47] <roboyuji> Sweet
[1:36:54] <%shurtal> Shephard out here, doing fucking rad vehicular parkour shit
[1:36:56] <Rei_Dsoto> That was cool as F-ck
[1:36:57] <%ironohki> @twistedj3ster Shepard.
[1:37:03] <%psidefx> Do a hard
[1:37:10] <%chance_h> The Mako is great
[1:37:22] <%skeleklng> Do you push that scrub out the window?
[1:37:23] <%DJFakie> "Hey! Everyone! This store discriminates against the poor!"
[1:37:27] <%psidefx> Do a barrelroll star Shepard
[1:37:28] <peachy996> The hunting shop is my favorite
[1:37:36] <%EsotericOdyssey> the mako has some fucking nutso suspension
[1:37:36] <%LumberjackJack> "So you're saying I'm poor?" is one of the best renegade interactions in ME2
[1:37:43] <SiameseSneeze> I love it
[1:37:45] <peachy996> That Turian is in love with selling you on guns
[1:37:49] <%Retinolgaming> @PatStaresAt Did you see they changed Kelly's look in ME2?
[1:37:58] <%shurtal> Shephard, Communo-cop
[1:38:12] <%valriot> LUL
[1:38:14] <Ipsenscastle> for real, I had the same experience
[1:38:14] <AlphaRayAllen> There's so much
[1:38:24] <SaltyAzteca> Space chimps man
[1:38:25] <%templar010> Yeah I kind of wish ME 2 had more -options- but I prefer its system
[1:38:26] <+Alopekis> ME2's shopping and equipment is just better.
[1:38:26] <%DJFakie> I don't know how you meaningfully explore these planets
[1:38:33] <%X2Eliah> yeah
[1:38:33] <stantheman_97> space monke
[1:38:36] <%AzureGale> DISCOVERY: The monkey doesn't have the module
[1:38:42] <%jillpilled> Monke
[1:38:44] <%valriot> ME3s equipment system is the best imo, more/heavier gun = slower cooldown, but powers go BRRRRR
[1:38:46] <BlackStarAura> The monkey’s in the very back of the mine, second tunnel
[1:38:49] <%ssjklyco> It's trippy that it's only been 26 years since first contact wars
[1:38:51] <%Garthunox> Are the monkeys here the Tach from KotoR?
[1:38:51] <otakon17> clip obtained
[1:38:51] <DatAsuna> mass effect 3 improved it though
[1:38:56] <%EsotericOdyssey> will shepard single-handedly instate Fully Automated Luxury Space Communism? (but no Gay, because they didn't patch that in to Legendary Edition)
[1:38:59] <jbrowning134> floating monkee
[1:38:59] <DatAsuna> The weight to cooldown system in 3 is fantastic
[1:39:00] <%skeleklng> BRO THAT IS THE SAME MONKEY MODEL FROM THE WITCHER 1 HOLY SHIT
[1:39:00] <%Monkeyweed21> all this character building doesnt matter when the game is piss easy and kinda jank
[1:39:02] <HollowMan190> psaCaw
[1:39:04] <Sunstalker> Just like Detroit Become Human. just get rid of 60% of the game and it improves
[1:39:06] <otakon17> ***
[1:39:06] <DatAsuna> as is the weapon customisation
[1:39:11] <%LumberjackJack> ME3 actually has the best equipment. A ton of weapons and customizable mods but it doesn't bombard you like ME1
[1:39:11] <%SilverJakler> I love the Paragon Interrupt at Aria's club near the start of ME2 where you take the kid's jank gun and fix it for him before he gets himself killed. It's nice and you get to be cool too
[1:39:16] <otakon17> I hear that Gief
[1:39:16] <peachy996> Warlord looks cool though
[1:39:24] <otakon17> I want Colossus armor
[1:39:24] <peachy996> It's the armor he wears in 2 I think
[1:39:27] <ape_hawk> m o n k e
[1:39:30] <%EsotericOdyssey> @LumberjackJack i liked that one sniper rifle that burst fired
[1:39:30] <%valriot> Throwing out Tech and Biotic Combos every 10s in ME3 feels super good
[1:39:33] <%EsotericOdyssey> in ME3
[1:39:33] <otakon17> seriously why is red and black so appealing
[1:39:36] <+Alopekis> He's all the way in the back of the mine, Pat.
[1:39:40] <+GuilKato> remember you can dress up kaidan in stuff for him to use of virmwire
[1:39:40] <%SilverJakler> monke that coo like pigeon
[1:39:41] <Rei_Dsoto> Monke
[1:39:43] <TheSaltminer> return to MONKE
[1:39:43] <%dapperdoop> monke has no module
[1:39:44] <%skeleklng> THAT IS LITERALLY THE SAME M O N K E FROM THE WITCHER 1 IT EVEN USES THE SAME ANIMATIONS HOLY SHIT
[1:39:45] <%Varlinator> jonahs1Monke jonahs1Monke jonahs1Monke jonahs1Monke
[1:39:48] <jbrowning134> Where is he "searching" the monekys?
[1:39:50] <fugly_nick> Every color works with black
[1:39:52] <theshillman> wait, are they making pitch-shifted pigeon noises?
[1:39:52] <Dfreddy8> Warlord and Battlemaster are cool armor sets
[1:39:52] <$Ziegsy> wtf is that pigeon sounding noise?
[1:39:54] <Wolfstriker121> being an adapt in me3 feels so good
[1:39:57] <+GuilKato> and find even trashier items than level 1 avenger to push on SpaceRacist
[1:40:03] <otakon17> DAMN YOU MONKE
[1:40:13] <%EsotericOdyssey> monkeys MonkaS-ing
[1:40:13] <moonmeh> me3 adept feels so nice
[1:40:17] <+Punchasaur> Good monke noises
[1:40:18] <otakon17> you know what I find hilarious?
[1:40:18] <notsoy> RETURN IT, MONKE
[1:40:29] <+Alopekis> What?
[1:40:30] <%SilverJakler> I'll never forgive them for not bringing the ME3 Multiplayer back. Really wanted to play that with my friends
[1:40:32] <%DJFakie> HE DROPPED THE DATA MODULE
[1:40:33] <DatAsuna> no
[1:40:37] <%AzureGale> HE DROPPED THE DATA MODULE
[1:40:40] <ioci2112> MONKE
[1:40:43] <ChungusQuest> Wrex was very excited there
[1:40:44] <knotsundownsyndrome> HE DROPPED THE DATA MODULE
[1:40:44] <%DJFakie> What a great line read.
[1:40:45] <%dapperdoop> clumsy monke
[1:40:46] <James_Quivers> Did those thigns not have names in this game? In ME@ they're called Pyjats or something, right?
[1:40:46] <DatAsuna> Andromeda was the only one where you played as a different character
[1:40:49] <+D00msDayDan> that line read is so perfect
[1:40:50] <peachy996> You only play as Joker and spoilers for Arrival
[1:40:51] <DatAsuna> and it's the shitty twin
[1:40:53] <TourettesPlays> monke work for geth
[1:40:56] <%SilverJakler> Wrex really sounded like he was about to fuck that monke up
[1:40:56] <%peanutdot007> Robots hate monkeys!
[1:40:59] <%dapperdoop> protect monke
[1:40:59] <SaltyAzteca> PERSONAL SPACE
[1:41:01] <otakon17> if you do NG+, and are SUPER high level and outfit Jenkin with the best carryover gear you have he STILL dies like a punk from a few shots to the chest.
[1:41:03] <Profmcstevie> Banana defender Shepard
[1:41:03] <AngryAsian5> Wrex is so happy about the data module
[1:41:05] <+LionKagura> Protect monke
[1:41:07] <+Alopekis> One of your teammates is always super excited about finding the data module in this mission.
[1:41:08] <$Faustgesicht> The monke were GETH all along!
[1:41:09] <DatAsuna> ah yeah joker has a walking sim segment
[1:41:09] <otakon17> you need combat optics
[1:41:10] <TheSaltminer> REJECT ROBOT, RETURN TO MONKE
[1:41:11] <peachy996> Fuckin Geth Destroyers always rushing your shit lmao
[1:41:15] <%MrBorisMakarov> what's that slug shotgun in me3 with one shot
[1:41:16] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Imagine if a text popped up in this mission, next t your HUD radar, saying "Monkies killed"
[1:41:16] <otakon17> KA-BOOM
[1:41:25] <otakon17> OOOH MEDICAL EXOSKELETON
[1:41:30] <ChungusQuest> ahh, they were shooting at that rapidly-expanding plasma cloud. That makes sense.
[1:41:30] <otakon17> that's some GOOD shit
[1:41:31] <%peanutdot007> This games economy is beyond fucked
[1:41:32] <%DJFakie> What if ME1 added a bank
[1:41:33] <ape_hawk> the money is going to alliance command
[1:41:34] <Mr_Taters > @SilverJakler They've mentioned they may bring it back, I really hope they do
[1:41:35] <%templar010> Take iiiit
[1:41:37] <Rei_Dsoto> You really should go buy things :P
[1:41:38] <%templar010> Come ooon
[1:41:42] <Dfreddy8> @mrborismakaro Claymore
[1:41:49] <%SilverJakler> @Mr_Taters dope
[1:41:51] <+GuilKato> but them on your crew then
[1:41:52] <peachy996> Krogans I can understand but Geth Destroyers going "BEEP BOOP RUSH HIM" is hilarious to me
[1:41:52] <%twistedj3ster> oh no here comes crazy talk....
[1:41:53] <%DJFakie> @Rei_Dsoto Only Spectre X is worth buying at this point
[1:41:57] <otakon17> I want to see you play this on Insanity and say that
[1:41:57] <%MrBorisMakarov> @Dfreddy8 that's right, thanks
[1:41:59] <%jillpilled> Shep's just turning money into omni gel by this point
[1:42:01] <cybz99> I do not remember this game's progression being this broken
[1:42:03] <Minorou> Gee Commander Shepard, why does your mom let you have three skeletons?
[1:42:04] <Rei_Dsoto> Fair enough
[1:42:05] <+Alopekis> There's really no point in buying anything but the Spectre gear.
[1:42:06] <otakon17> @peachy996 they big boys
[1:42:09] <%MrBorisMakarov> MrBorisMakarov gifted a Tier 1 sub to Dfreddy8! They have given 342 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:42:10] <%skeleklng> Say what you will about ME3 but the actual gameplay felt soo good to play. Don't know about Andromeda tho
[1:42:13] <otakon17> one more mineral
[1:42:15] <$Faustgesicht> What if ME1 added a villa like Assassin's Creed 2?
[1:42:15] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt What level are you?
[1:42:23] <%BappoTheMighty> BappoTheMighty subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 13 month streak! Hello today! I'm so excited for these ME streams! Stay awesome and pet the babies! <3
[1:42:25] <%DJFakie> 26
[1:42:27] <%X2Eliah> @cybz99 the LE condenses 2 runs into 1
[1:42:29] <otakon17> @Alopekis you can't afford the Spectre gear for the longest time though
[1:42:33] <%templar010> Ok
[1:42:37] <$renegade_blade> I haven't played the mass effect trilogy since like 2013, and completely forgot Shepard spent like 15 minutes frisking monkies until I got there
[1:42:37] <%bassoontyphoon> If only Jenkins had survived Ashley would have never needed to be in your party
[1:42:40] <Detrius25> Hey Pat. Hope you're enjoying Mass Effect...and disappointment later. daphHarold
[1:42:44] <%templar010> So one or two more levels for spectre x
[1:42:55] <+Punchasaur> Weird that the monkey planet has no trees
[1:43:08] <+GuilKato> @bassoontyphoon that would indeed be a rosey timeline - ME4 will need timetravel to make that happen
[1:43:14] <Sp3ctre48> ME3's gameplay is fantastic imo. though you only really get into it with the multiplayer
[1:43:24] <%Ranryu692> I wonder if there'll be a bunch of stuff in there
[1:43:26] <ape_hawk> "cornucopia" means "a lot of"
[1:43:28] <+Alopekis> @otakon17 Yeah, but it's still the only thing worth buying. It's the only thing you're really not going to just be handed. You get so many drops in this game that whatever you buy is probably going to be switched out after a mission or 2.
[1:43:28] <jbrowning134> Is it just me or does the map music sound distorted?
[1:43:30] <%DJFakie> Virmire system has planets with one of each to try to catch you up
[1:43:32] <TourettesPlays> Pat are you checking the asteroid belts for extra minerals?
[1:43:34] <%dapperdoop> put it in it
[1:43:44] <+Phoenon> I guess they don't give them out...lightly Kappa
[1:43:46] <%templar010> Oh yeah this ship
[1:43:58] <DatAsuna> andromeda also had good combat but it wasn't enough
[1:44:00] <%TheotherKristian> Alright I have decided to not buy this trilogy right away until it is at a low enough price for me. Instead I'll just live off of streams
[1:44:02] <otakon17> BURN BABY BURN
[1:44:03] <%MrBorisMakarov> they are just fucking showering you with money wtc
[1:44:04] <%MrBorisMakarov> wtf
[1:44:09] <+GuilKato> are you using the maps of minerals to find the hidden stuff that is outside the map?
[1:44:20] <%templar010> Shit I really slept on Barrier, you literally no sell fucking everything
[1:44:23] <peachy996> For as iffy as Andromeda is, I did like Havarl a lot as an explorable area
[1:44:28] <%Dfreddy8> Just look up a guide for the minerals and Planets they are found on.
[1:44:38] <ChungusQuest> "Rar, I'm ostensibly a threat!"
[1:44:59] <+GuilKato> but those sweet sweet minerals pat!
[1:45:00] <otakon17> goddammit high explosives are SO FUCKING SATISFYING on the shotgun and sniper rifle
[1:45:03] <%DJFakie> This quest is such a pain and they should have given you extra materials in ME2 for it
[1:45:08] <peachy996> Your Shotgun is basically a Grenade Launcher
[1:45:11] <peachy996> I love it
[1:45:15] <+RowenCleric> andromeda is honestly worth it if you get it for less then 10 bucks nowadays
[1:45:19] <otakon17> oooool brute force Pat
[1:45:36] <otakon17> and now you found another side quest
[1:45:38] <+Alopekis> There's much more of everything than what you have to get to finish the missions. Even with the Matriarch's writings, at one point you just get like 3 or 4 in some random shack.
[1:45:45] <%DJFakie> If you start saving now you should be able to replace the 6 million cost for all four
[1:45:46] <%dapperdoop> oh no a beacon
[1:45:53] <%Treuan> Hmmm
[1:46:04] <nesbitt22> are Dragon teeth referencing Vlad the impaler or Vikings
[1:46:05] <%DJFakie> But you're right, you don't super need all the Spectre X
[1:46:14] <$Ziegsy> anyone here in chat from the UK? I need to pee and theres a big old spider in the bathroom. I can provide the glass and paper.
[1:46:17] <SaltyAzteca> Wrex is so dramatic, I love it
[1:46:18] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA THE GETH DID THIS
[1:46:20] <otakon17> oh my bad I swear this did it
[1:46:30] <otakon17> Pistol for longer ranges and your shotty
[1:46:41] <+Alopekis> Honestly, you'll have more than enough money to get all Spectre X when it's available anyway.
[1:46:46] <otakon17> I dunno I outfit EVERYONE with the best I can
[1:46:47] <peachy996> There is one Bug Hunt I haven't seen you do
[1:46:51] <fugly_nick> That shotgun is already super accurate
[1:46:56] <%PhantomMiG> @nesbitt22 Neither they reference Jason and the argonauts a greek myth
[1:47:05] <%Garthunox> make sure you keep a bunch of shit to sell so you can get back to money cap after buying the spectre X stuff
[1:47:15] <+Alopekis> As you get farther and farther into the game, it becomes harder to harder to NOT max out your money.
[1:47:16] <SaltyAzteca> @fugly_nick No its not fully fuck busted yet
[1:47:18] <otakon17> yeah I really like how they reworked the weapons in ME1 for Legendary
[1:47:22] <otakon17> KYLE
[1:47:30] <James_Quivers> Hack my balls commander
[1:47:31] <+Alopekis> harder and harder*
[1:47:39] <+alphonseisbest> yea?
[1:47:40] <%Dfreddy8> Toombs
[1:47:42] <%WyvernOfMews> WyvernOfMews subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 24 month streak! I think I loved early Warframe so much because it filled a desire for more Mass Effect 1, jank included.
[1:48:07] <TourettesPlays> Lance Henriksen you're so fuckin cool i wish you were my dad and my uncle
[1:48:10] <James_Quivers> DR WAWEE
[1:48:11] <%DJFakie> Your CO is giving you carte blanche for potential murder...?
[1:48:13] <%LouieRouie> Dr. Thomas Wayne?
[1:48:16] <%ssjklyco> A broken mirror
[1:48:17] <+Alopekis> You're basically Canadian Shepard.
[1:48:18] <%NopeBadguy> a uh slightly skinnier mirror
[1:48:20] <SaltyAzteca> Thank you Shepherd for telling Shepard about that
[1:48:20] <ape_hawk> like one of those fun house mirrors?
[1:48:23] <dd44dostivei> it was a "splinter-cerberus" "splinter-alliance" group i guess?
[1:48:25] <%dapperdoop> those luscious lips
[1:48:26] <digaogrunge> AKUZE is where I got my cheek scar!
[1:48:32] <%valriot> You should go and... Akuze those guys of murder
[1:48:34] <KeystoneA2> One of ME2's big narrative failures is having a Sole Survivor player work with Cerberus
[1:48:34] <%MidnightBurst12> uh... sure
[1:48:40] <Broken_Sonex> Good ol Uncle Shepard
[1:48:41] <ioci2112> cerberus used thresher maws on akuze and killed shepard's unit and all the colonists, but you can't call them out on that
[1:48:46] <ape_hawk> oh, youre taking two lockpicks with you?
[1:48:46] <yeildingthought> Like a fish eye lens in reverse LUL
[1:48:49] <ape_hawk> seems a waste?
[1:48:51] <+FoolsArcade> @TourettesPlays so you wanna be an incest baby of your mom and her brother? lol
[1:48:58] <%chance_h> Is Zangeif a reflection of Grunt then?
[1:48:59] <moonmeh> LUL
[1:49:04] <%GalacticaPhanto> JAkuze!
[1:49:05] <%NopeBadguy> wait, explain that to me
[1:49:08] <+Alopekis> Mass Effect 2 just outright ignores the Sole Survivor start. It's really weird.
[1:49:09] <otakon17> oh man you aren't maxing HACKING Pat?
[1:49:11] <%NopeBadguy> i don't get why it's a narrative failure
[1:49:20] <peachy996> I feel like they assumed everyone would pick Colonist
[1:49:21] <otakon17> seriously Hacking a Geth Prime is the fucking FUNNIEST shit
[1:49:26] <heartlesshealer> Zangief baby. Grunt baby. Babies
[1:49:27] <%NopeBadguy> OH
[1:49:33] <James_Quivers> I think it only really fails if you let them have the collector base. If not, you can go "haha I played the long con, fuck you cerberus"
[1:49:36] <iosephe> brainwashing
[1:49:39] <stantheman_97> i always assumed it was because the reapers are a far, far worse threat
[1:49:40] <fugly_nick> And then it's not acknowledged in ME2
[1:49:46] <%bread_assassin> Does the game acknowledge that in 2?
[1:49:47] <Broken_Sonex> @NopeBadguy He working for the people that killed his buds dude
[1:49:48] <Darkred28> Yeah but the Alliance wasn't going to help him
[1:49:48] <%Mr_Pylon> the hand wave they try to make is pretty weak
[1:49:58] <otakon17> oh definitely
[1:49:59] <%Agami23> you know what would be neat? if there were some planets where tali doesent need the suit but everyone else needs suits
[1:50:02] <ape_hawk> there are lots of bitches in ME2
[1:50:05] <SiameseSneeze> KILL
[1:50:05] <%NopeBadguy> i completely forgot cerberus was responsible for akuze
[1:50:05] <otakon17> I am all for Paragon with combat pragmatism
[1:50:08] <Sp3ctre48> Cerberus changes depending on whoever is writing them at the time
[1:50:08] <SaltyAzteca> c-cute?
[1:50:09] <RedPlasticCup> bugs!
[1:50:10] <%DJFakie> You have our permission to shoot those bitches but being good feels good, Pat!
[1:50:10] <otakon17> NO KILL
[1:50:13] <%dapperdoop> crab bug
[1:50:16] <heartlesshealer> greetings to insect
[1:50:16] <%templar010> Its the most accurate IMO, just moments of random freakouts due to rez sickness
[1:50:18] <otakon17> they're chill!
[1:50:18] <%dekkitout> Bugs r fren PrideCute
[1:50:18] <James_Quivers> The renegade interrupt on that krogan clan speaker is required
[1:50:19] <stormhawk9891> Shoot those rocks there
[1:50:20] <SiameseSneeze> Gun them
[1:50:20] <%SilverJakler> Best type of Paragon, nice but ain't afraid to shoot a bitch
[1:50:23] <%valriot> Renegade in 3 is... OH MAN
[1:50:26] <%Dfreddy8> Like that Krogan who talks too much
[1:50:26] <%Monkeyweed21> Do you go Good Cop or Bad Cop in Garrus's loyalty mission?
[1:50:28] <%NocturneNovember> You absolutely have to push the dude out the window in ME2, it's the best renegade option
[1:50:35] <%SilverJakler> yeyeye
[1:50:35] <+Alopekis> Yeah. It's already a hard enough sell, considering Shepard's constantly bombarded with information that shows Cerberus to be pieces of shit during ME1. But then you add the Sole Survivor in the mix and it just makes the idea that he'd side with them ridiculous.
[1:50:35] <%LumberjackJack> LUL
[1:50:35] <+OmegaWeltall> LUL
[1:50:40] <+alphonseisbest> all the Paragon dialouge choice but pull ALL the Renegade Trrigers!
[1:50:44] <%DJFakie> "Watch this!"
[1:50:48] <+RowenCleric> thats a real thing
[1:50:49] <%dekkitout> Sounds pretty renegade
[1:50:49] <peachy996> "You're Working Too Hard"
[1:50:54] <Ranger747> thats right
[1:50:58] <SiameseSneeze> I love how you can punch the reporter in all 3 games
[1:50:59] <fugly_nick> The most important Renegade action is shooting Conrads foot
[1:51:18] <+Alopekis> You regretted punching the reporter?
[1:51:18] <SaltyAzteca> "Have a nice fall"
[1:51:18] <otakon17> I always thought Cerberus in ME1 was COMICALLY evil. "We're a rogue group trying to vy for human supremacity so ...LET'S KILL A BUNCH OF HUMANS TO DO IT!"
[1:51:20] <%DJFakie> Yeah, waiting for the Paragon for the reporter is WAY better
[1:51:22] <digaogrunge> Shepard would totally still work with Cerberus even if they shot his parents... the threat of the Reapers is to massive to ignore, even for a renegade shep
[1:51:25] <%SataruYamate> i like that you can hold a renegade interupt and then it turns into a paragon interupt
[1:51:25] <otakon17> yeah
[1:51:28] <James_Quivers> There's a paragon interrupt in 3 that is HEARTBREAKING but I won't spoil
[1:51:29] <DatAsuna> speaking of mass effect 3 spoilers: if you recruited morinth in mass effect 2, all she gets in 3 is an email and then a regular banshee in the last fight is named Morinth on her healthbar
[1:51:30] <Sp3ctre48> I think so?
[1:51:30] <heartlesshealer> the lightning on this planet is nice for a horizon thing
[1:51:30] <otakon17> I think they fixed that though
[1:51:31] <+GuilKato> and glassing Woodsman Pat - you regretted that renegade interupt
[1:51:33] <%LumberjackJack> Yeah, they fixed his questline bug in LE
[1:51:34] <Darkred28> Conrad can die in 2 if renegade, I believe
[1:51:38] <Nyterayce> paragon with reporters punch
[1:51:40] <peachy996> Just don't punch Al Jilani in 3 if you plan to Paragon it
[1:51:41] <dd44dostivei> SHEPARD STRAIGHT UP TELLS MORINTH "IF YOU'VE HEARD OF A BAND IT'S TOO POPULAR FOR ME"
[1:51:44] <DatAsuna> Conrad will be in 3, he'll just be affected differently
[1:51:44] <otakon17> also Conrad has I M P O R T A N C E in ME3
[1:51:47] <jcflyguy> Conrad is a good boy why would you renegade him
[1:51:48] <Basch71> I like how renegade in 2 is great to the point your party members chime in how much of a badass you are
[1:51:49] <%bread_assassin> The "you're working too hard" interupt during Garrus's recruitment mission is one I always do.
[1:51:51] <ape_hawk> conrads stuff pays on in ME3, but thats all ill say
[1:52:00] <ape_hawk> off*
[1:52:02] <heartlesshealer> greetings to object
[1:52:08] <DatAsuna> Conrad actually has unique dialogue in ME3 related to the colect 16 matriarch writings sidequest in ME1. It's SUPER obscure.
[1:52:09] <otakon17> oooh Shield Interface X
[1:52:15] <%valriot> The Mornith sex scene where you just die LUL
[1:52:15] <BlackStarAura> Conrad’s important
[1:52:16] <otakon17> that's the best Shield boost
[1:52:25] <%X2Eliah> Oh it will.
[1:52:25] <+Alopekis> @digaogrunge I think it's the fact that there's next to no hesitation that bothers me. Especially with the Sole Survivor background. Like, he doesn't even bring it up as an issue that would be bothering him.
[1:52:26] <SaltyAzteca> Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[1:52:28] <%DJFakie> Things go way worse in 3 for the most part if you Renegade
[1:52:31] <otakon17> god I love using the cannon on the Mako on foot mooks
[1:52:31] <%skeleklng> I usually just go for Neutral/Renegade tbh
[1:52:32] <%GarbageNirvana> Not if you're smart about it
[1:52:32] <heartlesshealer> greetings to future evaporated matter
[1:52:36] <%X2Eliah> Renegade decisions are sometimes BAD
[1:52:38] <otakon17> AND you get full XP for it now, it's glorious
[1:52:41] <peachy996> You mean the hissy fights near the end?
[1:52:47] <dd44dostivei> restrained renegade is the peak mass effect experience
[1:52:48] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah that's usually the issue, I hate playing paragon but it's way easier most of the time
[1:52:49] <peachy996> Cuz those sucks
[1:52:54] <%valriot> Yeah Renegade in 3 is like, Sith Lord
[1:52:54] <Broken_Sonex> I always did both P and R
[1:53:04] <heartlesshealer> greetings to mineral
[1:53:05] <dd44dostivei> angry paragon
[1:53:08] <kazubisha> ARTHUR FIST MEME
[1:53:09] <peachy996> The Miranda vs Jack argument is on of the worst
[1:53:17] <%DJFakie> Betray Wrex for almost no reason!
[1:53:17] <Darkred28> Shepard can be a genocidal maniac if you play him a certain way
[1:53:20] <Basch71> good ol' Paragade
[1:53:22] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt The Paragande if you would
[1:53:23] <Sp3ctre48> Based
[1:53:23] <T_Sasquatch> overall i was like 70 percent paragon, 30 percent renegade
[1:53:24] <Mr_Taters > @DatAsuna I totally forgot Conrad is involved in the payoff for that lol
[1:53:29] <ape_hawk> samara is the best biotic, anyway
[1:53:30] <James_Quivers> "I'm begging you on hands and knees, don't make me kill you" Renegade
[1:53:33] <ape_hawk> and cooler
[1:53:34] <%captain_thickthighs> You ever gonna touch Andromeda just for lols
[1:53:36] <+alphonseisbest> nah man Angry Paragon where its at!
[1:53:38] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Jack is the Sera of Mass Effect
[1:53:45] <+alphonseisbest> HEY JACK MELLOWS OUT IN 3 PAT :p
[1:53:48] <%DJFakie> The Reputation system in 3 was smart because it let you pick both
[1:53:49] <+punchdrunk_donkeybooy> People hate on Mako but nailing enemies with a ragdoll cannon never gets old @PatStaresAt
[1:53:52] <Sp3ctre48> Nah Jack is good
[1:53:56] <peachy996> It's the same problem as Jeong in this game. The requirement to talk them down is too damn high
[1:54:09] <%warpath1911> @TIME_PUNCHER Jack is better than sera
[1:54:11] <mr_mister0> weak
[1:54:12] <ioci2112> @TIME_PUNCHER I don't know if that's an insult to jack or a compliment to sera
[1:54:12] <kazubisha> a shirt
[1:54:14] <+alphonseisbest> YES
[1:54:16] <SiameseSneeze> Jack has a pretty good romance too
[1:54:18] <+alphonseisbest> agreed
[1:54:18] <kazubisha> its missing a shirt
[1:54:19] <%SilverJakler> Jack is big edge in 2
[1:54:19] <%DJFakie> Missing... clothes?
[1:54:19] <+Bogart4321> her clothes
[1:54:19] <peachy996> So you end up killing one or the other
[1:54:22] <%skeleklng> I love being a Renegade in 2 because you're just a spicy asshole to literally everyone for no reason
[1:54:22] <Yebruh817> Jack best
[1:54:23] <%Ranryu692> Jack's design in 2 is missing a lightsaber
[1:54:25] <%Raikouija> Are we ever gonna wonder what went horribly wrong with the ending of ME3? Or did we talk about this in a previous stream?
[1:54:26] <JetpackMcQuack> jack makes me sad
[1:54:27] <%GarbageNirvana> In ME2 she looks like a bad skinhead
[1:54:32] <yeildingthought> @bogart4321 LUL
[1:54:35] <ChungusQuest> Well, she's bald and naked, so that sentiment makes sense
[1:54:36] <Sp3ctre48> Sera is like...almost the worst character Bioware ever made so nothing is even comparable to her
[1:54:36] <stantheman_97> i don't like bald girls either
[1:54:37] <ape_hawk> paragon wouldve been worth it in ME2 if it gave you a fucking halo for being so paragon, like how renegade fucks you up
[1:54:40] <fugly_nick> Both of Jack's alternate costumes in ME2 are better than her default
[1:54:42] <%Retinolgaming> I like her design in 2, she looks like shaved head natalie portman in V for vendetta with tats.
[1:54:42] <%DJFakie> Fucking Christ this shotgun
[1:54:44] <heartlesshealer> isn't Jack just freshly free in 2? They would have kept Jack shorn for identification and testing or whatever
[1:54:45] <%GarbageNirvana> ...not that I'm saying there's good skinheads
[1:54:46] <Darkred28> The shotgun sounds awesome
[1:54:55] <+Bogart4321> her tattoos are clothes
[1:54:56] <peachy996> Jack gets better in 3, gets some character development because of you
[1:54:56] <+Alopekis> Yeah
[1:54:56] <Sp3ctre48> yeah
[1:54:56] <SiameseSneeze> yeh
[1:54:56] <ape_hawk> yes
[1:54:57] <%BigCoffee> yes
[1:54:57] <%DJFakie> It's DLC
[1:54:57] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[1:54:58] <Basch71> yes
[1:54:58] <dd44dostivei> dlc
[1:54:59] <%MrBorisMakarov> YEAH
[1:54:59] <Darkred28> You didn't know that?
[1:55:00] <%QueequegTheater> Some of them fucking suck
[1:55:01] <%bugz_munny> yeah totally
[1:55:01] <kazubisha> you didnt know?
[1:55:01] <SiameseSneeze> complete loyalty mission
[1:55:02] <%valriot> Yeah?
[1:55:02] <%NateyBeak> yea her alt looks great
[1:55:03] <+Alopekis> You didn't know they had alternate costumes?
[1:55:03] <aiutare47> you didnt know that?!
[1:55:03] <+alphonseisbest> YES
[1:55:03] <JoshTheFace> dlc
[1:55:03] <RaidenRising> yes
[1:55:04] <Zalapski> in LE yes
[1:55:05] <%JoshManVGH> Hell yeah! DLC
[1:55:05] <digaogrunge> @Alopekis I dont think Shepard ever really expresses how things went down in Akuze (or how he feels about it in general), in any of the games, but I get you
[1:55:05] <stormhawk9891> Both
[1:55:05] <%BigCoffee> dlc
[1:55:06] <Mr_Taters > both
[1:55:06] <heartlesshealer> DLC
[1:55:06] <dd44dostivei> both
[1:55:06] <%AzureGale> Both
[1:55:07] <+alphonseisbest> DUH
[1:55:07] <fugly_nick> One is DLC, one is from her loalty mission
[1:55:07] <DatAsuna> they were free
[1:55:08] <Botman_R> both
[1:55:08] <%Canti510> yeah, both DLC and loyalty outfits
[1:55:08] <%valriot> Both
[1:55:09] <%UvBenServed> Both I think
[1:55:09] <%Retinolgaming> Both
[1:55:10] <%bread_assassin> Both?
[1:55:10] <%MidnightBurst12> yes
[1:55:10] <T_Sasquatch> i just hit an actual jojo reference in gangos from ffxiv and im dying
[1:55:10] <karl_rex> Yeah but they are Cerberus colors
[1:55:10] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @ioci2112 both
[1:55:11] <otakon17> DLC and Loyalty
[1:55:12] <%DJFakie> Well, it's both
[1:55:12] <ioci2112> yes, you unlock some of them with dlc, some of them with loyalty
[1:55:12] <%Dfreddy8> BOTH
[1:55:13] <heartlesshealer> both
[1:55:13] <Rei_Dsoto> The Loyalty Missions
[1:55:13] <%DakotaMacDoodle> yeah
[1:55:13] <%SataruYamate> some have dlc outfits, but yes a lyalty thing
[1:55:14] <jcflyguy> Loytaly and DLC
[1:55:15] <+alphonseisbest> YES
[1:55:15] <Mattais88> Loyalty gives one
[1:55:16] <peachy996> I disagree about Jack's alts, I like the base design more
[1:55:17] <%LumberjackJack> LE includes DLC costumes. There are also loyalty variations
[1:55:19] <%DakotaMacDoodle> both
[1:55:21] <LluthyY> Yep
[1:55:23] <+alphonseisbest> how did you never see that?!
[1:55:23] <otakon17> Loyalty missions give you a bonus costume and she gets DLC
[1:55:24] <%skeleklng> Both, I remember Miranda getting a skin-tight black suit
[1:55:26] <%JoshManVGH> They have a Non-Sexy Merianda costume.
[1:55:27] <DatAsuna> yeah some characters had multiple alt costumes
[1:55:29] <%valriot> Same in 3, everyone has about 4-5 costumes in that
[1:55:32] <Samurai_Tchan> @Sp3ctre48 micheal sera
[1:55:33] <LluthyY> Loyalty and dlc
[1:55:33] <peachy996> Thane is so goofy
[1:55:33] <%BigCoffee> You have all the dlc already
[1:55:35] <otakon17> Tali gets a TON of costumes IIRC
[1:55:35] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt A Paragade playthrough is always really fun. Just this asshole that still does the good guy stuff.
[1:55:36] <DatAsuna> In ME3 a bunch of them have 3+ outfits
[1:55:43] <%SilverJakler> a madmun
[1:55:43] <%DJFakie> MADMIN
[1:55:45] <%LumberjackJack> Sadly, most aren't good. They all include odd visors you can't remove
[1:55:49] <ape_hawk> adrian tooms?
[1:55:54] <otakon17> yes tell the man with the GUN to your chest insane
[1:55:59] <%dekkitout> HE GOT BETTER
[1:56:00] <fugly_nick> Oh this is ruined by that barrier
[1:56:05] <%skeleklng> Thane's alternate outfit gives him sick sunglasses
[1:56:06] <%QueequegTheater> I'LL NEVER JOIN THEM
[1:56:07] <Samurai_Tchan> JENKINS ?
[1:56:09] <%SirGO0SE> this backtrack is perfect for this scene
[1:56:11] <+EmptyMug> Man, medical companies are REALLY corrupt in Mass Effect
[1:56:12] <otakon17> you gotta help Toombs Pat
[1:56:13] <Samurai_Tchan> you returned ?
[1:56:18] <+Alopekis> @digaogrunge He doesn't, but if there was ever a time for him to express those emotions then coming face-to-face with the people who did it would be the time. It just seemed like such a massive missed opportunity for them to add some unique conflict in the story for that background.
[1:56:19] <James_Quivers> COOMS!?
[1:56:22] <JetpackMcQuack> SeemsGood light em up
[1:56:23] <heartlesshealer> =)
[1:56:25] <Sp3ctre48> Very grey organization feeding people to giant worm monster
[1:56:26] <%slimmixrp> This guys armor is sick
[1:56:27] <Samurai_Tchan> cyber jenkins toombs ?
[1:56:28] <plaguedoctor_syan> I remember there was a video where people replace Sheperd with Jack in Miranda romance screen and people started saying that you could make them romance each other
[1:56:39] <tanarath> SHEPARD WILL NEVER EVER EVER WORK FOR CERBERUS
[1:56:42] <peachy996> I think....Garrus has the best DLC outfit in 2?
[1:56:42] <%JoshManVGH> Armored Assed Merianda is probably the funniest.
[1:56:44] <AlphaRayAllen> The animations in this game though
[1:56:45] <%GarbageNirvana> HE was THEEEERE
[1:56:48] <iosephe> wait what
[1:56:50] <SaltyAzteca> Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah but no
[1:56:51] <+Pequod1> destroyed cerberus hmmm
[1:56:53] <otakon17> >Cerberus >destroyed
[1:56:55] <%Maids4lyfe> OH
[1:56:56] <AlphaRayAllen> LET ME DO IT
[1:56:56] <ape_hawk> yeeeeeeeah, about that
[1:56:56] <otakon17> yeah no
[1:56:59] <JetpackMcQuack> for humanity
[1:57:00] <Rei_Dsoto> LUL LUL
[1:57:02] <otakon17> they ARE just a splinter cell
[1:57:02] <heartlesshealer> 8 )
[1:57:03] <digaogrunge> @Alopekis true
[1:57:10] <%miguelrod777> destroy cerebus huh
[1:57:16] <SiameseSneeze> I'm with Toombs
[1:57:19] <%QueequegTheater> He's got a fait point
[1:57:20] <peachy996> "You're better than this Toombs but I'm not"
[1:57:23] <+Bogart4321> let him cut off a finger
[1:57:25] <DatAsuna> he's not wrong
[1:57:30] <arkv01> toombs is absolutely right
[1:57:37] <AlphaRayAllen> aku?
[1:57:38] <digaogrunge> LUL
[1:57:41] <+senfood> Good answer haha
[1:57:45] <tanarath> VERY EMBARRESSED
[1:57:46] <otakon17> Akuze
[1:57:47] <ioci2112> yeah but shoot him a little first tho
[1:57:48] <iosephe> isn't he a soldier?
[1:57:49] <Sp3ctre48> woah Meer calm down, you started showing emotion D:
[1:57:50] <peachy996> Toombs is gonna be pissed off at you in 2
[1:57:52] <+Bogart4321> yea yea yea
[1:57:53] <moonmeh> he already killed... many scienetists though?
[1:57:54] <$Ziegsy> but he killed the others, right?
[1:57:56] <arkv01> thats his death flag isn't it
[1:58:00] <peachy996> He gives you an angry email
[1:58:06] <Samurai_Tchan> i think the quarians are also robots ,that believe they are not robots
[1:58:09] <stantheman_97> prison for life is worse than death im9
[1:58:12] <otakon17> it's an origin for Shepard, you're the lone survivor of an Alliance unit that gets destroyed by a Thresher Maw
[1:58:12] <AlphaRayAllen> Oh ok
[1:58:12] <+Alopekis> I hate how this plays out with Toombs in ME2.
[1:58:14] <stantheman_97> *imo
[1:58:15] <SaltyAzteca> You did good Shepat
[1:58:15] <+Bogart4321> nice cut....
[1:58:19] <otakon17> yeah a lot of them end like that
[1:58:27] <%DianaTheAscian> that was sad
[1:58:27] <otakon17> Aye you did good Shepard
[1:58:30] <%Ranryu692> I have absolutely no recollection of those expository dialogue boxes
[1:58:38] <TungstenViper> that ending is so bad
[1:58:52] <peachy996> I think these boxes show that som missions were rushed
[1:58:57] <+Alopekis> But who is Banes?
[1:59:01] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Toombs sends you an email in ME2 saying that he's appalled that you joined Cerberus.
[1:59:04] <Mr_Britannia> So you only get this mission if you chose a specific origin?
[1:59:16] <%QueequegTheater> Your room
[1:59:22] <+Alopekis> Emails are fun
[1:59:23] <digaogrunge> FISH
[1:59:25] <srv4254> yea
[1:59:28] <otakon17> I LOVE THE EMAILS
[1:59:30] <peachy996> Yep
[1:59:30] <%JoshManVGH> Oh yeah!
[1:59:31] <+Alopekis> Especially when you get spam mail
[1:59:31] <+RowenCleric> the hamster
[1:59:32] <heartlesshealer> oh yeah
[1:59:32] <otakon17> and the REACTIONS to stuff you did
[1:59:34] <otakon17> I LOVED IT
[1:59:35] <Profmcstevie> Being a professional commander
[1:59:35] <%QueequegTheater> MAKE SURE TO FEED THE FISH
[1:59:36] <%condemned_15> collecting models
[1:59:37] <kazubisha> and you got fake spam ones too
[1:59:39] <%DakotaMacDoodle> yeah
[1:59:39] <%LumberjackJack> Commander, you've received a message on your private terminal
[1:59:39] <DatAsuna> a lot of things in mass effect is emails
[1:59:41] <DatAsuna> swtor too
[1:59:42] <DracaenaLeaf> all these quest endings remind me of Blood Debts
[1:59:42] <AngryAsian5> "You have a new message in your private terminal."
[1:59:44] <tanarath> Emails are great
[1:59:47] <otakon17> AND THE MINATURE GIANT SPACE HAMSTER
[1:59:48] <%skeleklng> Are you going to bang your secretary?
[1:59:51] <%JoshManVGH> And the psych reviews of the crew where neat.
[1:59:54] <Profmcstevie> Consequences and follow ups to my actions MAKE BRAIN HAPPY
[1:59:59] <James_Quivers> GOOD, YOU OPENED THIS EMAIL
[2:00:02] <peachy996> This might be the Bug hunt
[2:00:02] <BlackStarAura> The mission happens regardless but it’s special with the Sole Survivor origin
[2:00:05] <%Dfreddy8> "No new messages Commande"
[2:00:05] <%Varlinator> It all adds up when you beat 2 & look back through all those messages
[2:00:05] <DatAsuna> LE did do kelly dirty tho
[2:00:08] <%Treuan> Kelly is cool
[2:00:10] <+Pequod1> She freaky
[2:00:10] <otakon17> Kelly is great
[2:00:10] <%kujofire990> oh no nto EREBUS
[2:00:11] <%Retinolgaming> They changed her look in 2 LUL
[2:00:14] <DatAsuna> Kelly got downgraded
[2:00:17] <peachy996> Yup
[2:00:17] <+Alopekis> I do wonder how much the emails were used as a way to avoid actually making missions to tie in things that happened in ME1.
[2:00:18] <James_Quivers> She fucks VArren tho
[2:00:18] <T_Sasquatch> but she is ugly as fuck in 2
[2:00:19] <Ultimatefool> I kinda miss all these filler planets from 1
[2:00:19] <%bassoontyphoon> Kinda bug and kinda bug
[2:00:21] <ChungusQuest> Kelly the pansexual fish-murderer?
[2:00:22] <%SilverJakler> oh hi Grey DeIsle

[2:00:25] <%LumberjackJack> Gotta rescue Azula
[2:00:25] <%Puhff> what did LE do to Kelly? :(
[2:00:25] <%Canti510> GREY DE LISLE
[2:00:26] <DatAsuna> Kelly deserves better
[2:00:30] <SaltyAzteca> Be a hero!
[2:00:32] <T_Sasquatch> she is legit cute in og me2

[2:00:34] <karl_rex> Man Kelly is the one time a Paragon choice backfires
[2:00:35] <otakon17> I love Grey Delisle
[2:00:35] <peachy996> For some reason I like this Bug Hunt but its not spectacular
[2:00:45] <otakon17> yeah not every belt has a hidden scannable
[2:00:48] <digaogrunge> Chambers is THE cannon ME2 babe, screw Miranda
[2:00:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Has Pat Taken off the Rubber yet
[2:00:55] <%DJFakie> There's a renegade line in this that's really fun
[2:00:55] <DatAsuna> Grey Delilse is great as the bounty hunter player voice in swtor too
[2:00:55] <peachy996> I forget why I liked this
[2:00:58] <$Ziegsy> my listening comprehension fucked off and I heard her name as 'Mary Reacharound'
[2:01:04] <%skeleklng> I was gonna play Femshep in this game but they fucked up her model in the LE so it looks like she got an underbite whenever she talks
[2:01:05] <otakon17> I kinda wish there were more kinds of Rachni
[2:01:05] <%Retinolgaming> OG ME2 Kelly > New Kelly
[2:01:10] <otakon17> like a SUPER big one
[2:01:19] <otakon17> lol

[2:02:09] <+Alopekis> I want a hanar teammate
[2:02:11] <peachy996> Javik
[2:02:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Because the Writing is bad
[2:02:13] <fugly_nick> Javik is a cool alien
[2:02:16] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[2:02:16] <KeystoneA2> You have to play Multiplayer for the cool shit
[2:02:19] <%LumberjackJack> Javik is basically your krogan
[2:02:19] <ape_hawk> because ME3 was rushed and shitty
[2:02:21] <%valriot> Javik is the coolest
[2:02:22] <%NopeBadguy> don't you get grunt?
[2:02:22] <peachy996> That sucks about 3, the on game with no Krogan
[2:02:23] <digaogrunge> Javik ma dude
[2:02:24] <moonmeh> at least javik is close
[2:02:25] <TioXyco> krogan too busy fucking
[2:02:25] <%afronooch> Javik rules
[2:02:25] <+alphonseisbest> cuz that game is undercooked
[2:02:28] <dd44dostivei> human, alien, robot
[2:02:28] <$Ziegsy> @ape_hawk still going. Just got a story update. Not full release yet thou
[2:02:28] <%Treuan> Elcor crew member damnit all

[2:02:30] <%Retinolgaming> Grunt?
[2:02:31] <otakon17> dude
[2:02:31] <%shurtal> His nam is Freddy Prinz jr
[2:02:32] <peachy996> EVEN ANDROMEDA gives you a Krogan
[2:02:34] <otakon17> JAVIK is cool
[2:02:38] <+Alopekis> Javik is pretty neat
[2:02:39] <xbb1024> Because ME3 is about human supremacy
[2:02:40] <+Pequod1> in the UNIVERSE
[2:02:42] <+alphonseisbest> Hard J
[2:02:43] <otakon17> AND HE WAS LOCKED BEHIND DAY ONE DLC
[2:02:44] <James_Quivers> Javik is like a Krogan but SMART AND JAMAICAN
[2:02:44] <%Monkeyweed21> Its possible to make the entire Krogan race DESPISE YOU in ME3 @PatStaresAt
[2:02:46] <%Raikouija> A prothean on preorder that’s what you get
[2:02:46] <Pookiedaexzile> That doesn't count
[2:02:46] <%SilverJakler> Javik's pretty dope
[2:02:48] <otakon17> GOD that pisses me off
[2:02:48] <%QueequegTheater> It's pronounced with a J not a Y
[2:02:49] <%LumberjackJack> It was fucking bullshit
[2:02:49] <%Dfreddy8> Too many Humanoids for my liking
[2:02:52] <battlexqueen> you say this about a different person every stream
[2:02:57] <PinkSocks> I wish Vega was half as good as Javik
[2:03:00] <%jillpilled> Javik is fucking rad and such an asshole I love him
[2:03:01] <otakon17> Javik is a kick ass Biotic/Soldier mix
[2:03:02] <DatAsuna> gaskwang javik
[2:03:04] <Pookiedaexzile> That doesn't count and you know it
[2:03:06] <+fetrigon> javik is sick KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[2:03:08] <peachy996> I dunno why they didn't just add Grunt in
[2:03:10] <stantheman_97> that's fucking awful
[2:03:10] <%QueequegTheater> Hard J
[2:03:11] <%sabertoothzombie> Javik is awesome
[2:03:11] <AluxStreams> Just pretend Vega is a krogan. :)
[2:03:12] <%Ranryu692> hard J
[2:03:12] <DatAsuna> Vega is fantastic
[2:03:12] <battlexqueen> lool got it
[2:03:16] <otakon17> instead of a kickass KROGAN we get MEATHEAD VEGA
[2:03:16] <%valriot> ME3s launch release was bad, but that game being out fully and in this, its fine
[2:03:17] <JetpackMcQuack> ME3 story was early access
[2:03:20] <+BigBruthaThunda> javick was in the base game too, but they locked him behind a paywall
[2:03:21] <otakon17> I mean Vega isn't the worst
[2:03:23] <+Pequod1> love crushing everything Liara thinks she knows about her research
[2:03:23] <+alphonseisbest> @PinkSocks Hey Vega ok dude, leave my boi alone :P
[2:03:25] <digaogrunge> ME3s plot makes no sense without Javik, its insane
[2:03:26] <moonmeh> Its such a cool reveal
[2:03:27] <ScreamLord> He's super pissed
[2:03:27] <%Retinolgaming> @PatStaresAt Some of his unique dialog on Thessia in Me3 is criminal it was missed by people.
[2:03:29] <Samurai_Tchan> duchebigues
[2:03:31] <peachy996> Grunt and Jack have the least to do in 3 and yet you can't put them in the skwad
[2:03:31] <%SilverJakler> Pronounced "Jah-Vick"
[2:03:31] <%valriot> Hes like "Asari can write??"
[2:03:31] <otakon17> the Protheans were basically Ancient Rome
[2:03:32] <%Puhff> oh yeah the Protheans suuuuck!
[2:03:32] <SaltyAzteca> Liara gets all sorts of confused
[2:03:33] <%NopeBadguy> i mean it kinda comes with the territory of being an EMPIRE
[2:03:34] <%afronooch> Vega is very okay
[2:03:37] <ChaosedStar> This collection includes all the DLCs right?
[2:03:38] <%DJFakie> There is Light Metal here but it might not be marked on the map
[2:03:40] <sgtbloopface> nah zaeed was also day 1 dlc
[2:03:43] <jorniev> RASTAS
[2:03:45] <otakon17> Liara becomes a badass
[2:03:46] <moonmeh> protheans being a bunch of imperialistic pricks is a good reveal
[2:03:47] <Samurai_Tchan> they are the lords of space
[2:03:52] <James_Quivers> Javik takes glee in ripping apart Liaras assumptions about proheons, it's great
[2:03:53] <Broken_Sonex> OMG THE PROTHIANS ARE THE RAKATA
[2:03:55] <Samurai_Tchan> they are the king of spaces
[2:03:56] <%Rumbutt> I kind of felt that that was probably be how the Protheans would be all the way from ME1 when Liara was marking out over how great they were
[2:03:58] <%ArchimerCXV> it's hilarious how many features of ME3 is dunking on liara and her people for revering protheans
[2:04:01] <%QueequegTheater> Vega is a CoD character isekai'ed into ME and the game knows it, it's great
[2:04:01] <intylerwe_trust> What’s up Pat
[2:04:06] <+fetrigon> you're a douchebag PunOko PunOko PunOko
[2:04:06] <DatAsuna> That said Vega is also a little creepy because he actively does NOT want to bang shepard until you take advantage of him when he's drunk
[2:04:11] <%Rumbutt> I was like, Protheans were probably big space fascists
[2:04:13] <$Ziegsy> I completely forgot they put mass effect armour in ff13-2. I had to look it up because I thought I was having a stroke
[2:04:14] <DatAsuna> And he also regrets it after
[2:04:14] <%PhantomMiG> I mean the Prothen are always discribed as an empire
[2:04:15] <jorniev> JAMAICAN ELDER BEINGS
[2:04:15] <peachy996> Primitives
[2:04:16] <Samurai_Tchan> proteans are the lords of all the spaces
[2:04:18] <%DJFakie> If you get Titanium you're done with the collection
[2:04:18] <fugly_nick> ME1 and Kotor 1 are so insanely close in structure
[2:04:22] <%afronooch> @QueequegTheater holy shit that is the best description
[2:04:25] <%jillpilled> @retinolgaming man I might need to actually buy this remake collection if that's the case think I took other ppl to Thesia
[2:04:27] <Pookiedaexzile> ME3 got people defending what would be the worst character in a Call of Duty game
[2:04:31] <kefka_himself> yep like i said proteans were renegade af
[2:04:33] <otakon17> @ArchimerCXV and then they found out that the Protheans basically uplifted the asari while they were still mono-gendered squids
[2:04:35] <DatAsuna> So shepard kinda crosses the line there
[2:04:36] <%SilverJakler> ah yes i love space frogger
[2:04:39] <otakon17> FINALLY!
[2:04:44] <otakon17> THE FINAL LIGHT METAL
[2:04:47] <%QueequegTheater> @afronooch it's great
[2:04:49] <%Dfreddy8> DONE FINALLY
[2:04:51] <Samurai_Tchan> proteans probably invented the big bang
[2:04:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> >Javik telling that Hanar that his ancestors were eaten like sushi LUL sbfpSetIn woolieSHOOK
[2:05:00] <%DJFakie> Yep!
[2:05:06] <+Alopekis> @ChaosedStar I think. There might be something missing. Like I think there was a Dragon Age armor you could get in the original for something but I don't think it's in the LE. But all the good stuff is there. I'm pretty sure they changed it to where the armor is just automatically given to you now though, so you can go get it like any other armor piece.
[2:05:06] <otakon17> lol
[2:05:12] <fugly_nick> Dat lens flare tho
[2:05:19] <otakon17> Goddammit I have loved these ME streams lately
[2:05:19] <%Retinolgaming> @jillpilled Bring Javik and Liara. It's great.
[2:05:23] <@PeachSaliva> I would let Garrus pee on me.
[2:05:23] <kefka_himself> @generalscpatton  that was epic XD
[2:05:26] <peachy996> What a sick Skybox
[2:05:27] <%afronooch> @Alopekis pinnacle station is the missing dlc
[2:05:27] <%QueequegTheater> nagHandsup LIGHT nagHandsup METALS nagHandsup FINISHED nagHandsup
[2:05:27] <Sp3ctre48> no
[2:05:29] <fugly_nick> No it's there
[2:05:29] <%DJFakie> Again, that metal collection quest should have had a ME2 bonus
[2:05:30] <%templar010> No its there
[2:05:30] <otakon17> I don't think so
[2:05:31] <Zalapski> no its there
[2:05:31] <dd44dostivei> no it's there
[2:05:32] <James_Quivers> >Javik being incredulous that Salarians actually managed to evolve
[2:05:32] <Basch71> its there
[2:05:33] <SiameseSneeze> Hi Paige

[2:05:36] <DatAsuna> The dragon armour is not gone
[2:05:36] <reasonance> its been so long but I still sorta vaguely recognize that tunnel entrance I think
[2:05:36] <AluxStreams> Paige please no
[2:05:36] <otakon17> the blood dragon armor
[2:05:37] <+Alopekis> I'm not 100% sure that it's gone. It could still be there.
[2:05:37] <%W1nterTitan> No it's there
[2:05:37] <stormhawk9891> No it's still there
[2:05:38] <fugly_nick> The dragon armor is in stores

[2:05:48] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt dragon armor is still there
[2:05:49] <%sabertoothzombie> it's still there
[2:05:49] <%dekkitout> ...
[2:05:49] <+FoolsArcade> I wouldn't call it a plot point
[2:05:49] <peachy996> As long as she doesn't ingest
[2:05:49] <%DianaTheAscian> Worth?
[2:05:50] <%DJFakie> It's toxic, Paige
[2:05:50] <DatAsuna> I don't know why he said the armor is gone
[2:05:51] <%BentArcher> I thought it was his semen
[2:05:51] <Zalapski> you have to buy dragon armor on omega i think
[2:05:52] <Samurai_Tchan> in the begining it there was nothing, but then a particle in the shape of a protean head that started the big bang
[2:05:52] <%Raikouija> Well then paige
[2:05:52] <nevan_44> LUL
[2:05:53] <%MidnightBurst12> WORTH

[2:05:55] <%Treuan> uh
[2:05:55] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt No, Blood Dragon Armor is still in ME2. You just have to buy it or research

[2:05:59] <JetpackMcQuack> Your logic won't work here

[2:06:08] <%king_wragles> There's a lot to unpack here, and I don't want it
[2:06:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> DO NOT INGEST
[2:06:09] <%NateyBeak> paige LOVES bird cops

[2:06:13] <%WutangchickeN> but would you drink the pee
[2:06:16] <kefka_himself> yeah
[2:06:17] <BlackStarAura> You can buy it from the shops
[2:06:20] <%Rumbutt> Turians are LITERALLY toxic oroLUL
[2:06:20] <+LionKagura> ingest
[2:06:21] <BenLanBen> When you pee on Garrus you also die
[2:06:23] <@PeachSaliva> wait I would not drink the pee
[2:06:25] <arkv01> ok hear me out though, what about injecting the pee into your ass?
[2:06:25] <@PeachSaliva> That’s icky
[2:06:25] <+cunningchaff> urine doesn't have proteins
[2:06:30] <James_Quivers> Paige, get with Tali instead, she has all the risk in that relationship instead
[2:06:30] <nevan_44> paige...  LUL
[2:06:30] <%bassoontyphoon> You can ingest stuff through your skin though
[2:06:32] <heartlesshealer> @PeachSaliva he got that deadly D too
[2:06:32] <%Varlinator> Just don't upset the hanar & you won't need his pee
[2:06:34] <+cunningchaff> unless your kidneys are fucked up
[2:06:34] <%chance_h> Drinking Garrus juice was always your idea
[2:06:36] <%WutangchickeN> that's fair
[2:06:36] <JetpackMcQuack> Besides, there are like pills and stuff
[2:06:37] <rekinom> He has everything Piage wants: Pee
[2:06:42] <+OG_M_Bison> Wait why are there Rachni here???
[2:06:42] <AluxStreams> Does Garrus pee?
[2:06:45] <otakon17> QUICK get out and repair the turrets!

[2:06:49] <otakon17> GET OUT
[2:06:50] <ScreamLord> All the DLC armor is still in ME2 you just have too look for it now
[2:06:50] <@PeachSaliva> Wait Garrus’s pee is a plot point? This game rules
[2:06:53] <otakon17> TALK TO THE LADY
[2:06:53] <dd44dostivei> what does dextro pee taste like
[2:06:57] <%Raikouija> Tali is like the alien version of Paige, fragile as hell
[2:06:58] <Dunmarkh> @PeachSaliva WHAT'S THE POINT IF YOU DON'T DRINK IT? I'm confused
[2:06:59] <@PeachSaliva> Do we see Garrus’s penor
[2:07:05] <%WutangchickeN> aren't turians like bird people?  don't they make like bird shits???
[2:07:08] <+Alopekis> @PeachSaliva Garrus uses his pee to kill a Reaper.
[2:07:10] <%bassoontyphoon> I wish
[2:07:16] <Samurai_Tchan> war is so uncivilized
[2:07:19] <fugly_nick> What the hell would a Turian dick look like
[2:07:19] <BlackStarAura> Hook up the Mako to the turrets
[2:07:24] <%DJFakie> @PeachSaliva No spoilers for your playthrough
[2:07:24] <James_Quivers> The crest on his head is his penis
[2:07:25] <heartlesshealer> @PeachSaliva For real though, you can't kiss Garrus unless one of you doesn't kiss back
[2:07:26] <DatAsuna> Hey grey
[2:07:27] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @PatStaresAt what the fuck do you mean garrus can kill you by peeing on you
[2:07:27] <otakon17> >left out of 90 men
[2:07:28] <SaltyAzteca> JUST TO BE SURE
[2:07:29] <peachy996> @PeachSaliva We don't but trust me when I say there's tons of fan interpretation
[2:07:30] <%Retinolgaming> He is basically a dinosaur man.
[2:07:30] <RetributionP> there coming out of the God damn ground!
[2:07:36] <%SilverJakler> Weaponize the Turian Piss
[2:07:37] <+Alopekis> @fugly_nick They have a cloaca
[2:07:39] <otakon17> the Rachni wiped out over EIGHT marines
[2:07:39] <%Raikouija> Let’s just say Paige you can’t swallow turian fluids or risk a lethal allergic reaction
[2:07:41] <%bassoontyphoon> Is this starship troopers
[2:07:46] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva not quite. But it is in the game codex lore that Turians have proteins in their body that would cause potentially lethal allergic reactions
[2:07:48] <%LouieRouie> Werewolves!? We gotta get out of here!
[2:07:50] <%GarbageNirvana> DEXTRO AMINOS
[2:07:50] <%watts121> Where is Pat on the Main Questline?
[2:07:51] <%LumberjackJack> Dextro-amino acids
[2:07:52] <+CookieCutter007> EVEN BETTER
[2:07:52] <otakon17> They're dextro-acid
[2:07:53] <aiutare47> it will make you very sick to drink
[2:07:54] <%afronooch> dextro-whatever
[2:07:54] <JetpackMcQuack> They piss cyanide
[2:07:56] <Profmcstevie> Toxic
[2:07:56] <tanarath> Already better than Ashley.
[2:07:57] <+cunningchaff> Urine is sterile, and doesn't normally contain proteins, which is where the issue is
[2:07:59] <otakon17> Turians AND Quarians are like that
[2:08:00] <TioXyco> and yet, you can fuck garrus in 3
[2:08:01] <TourettesPlays> if you eat turian shit
[2:08:02] <WolfFreed> Quarians too
[2:08:05] <arkv01> so they can't fuck?
[2:08:06] <+cunningchaff> It's the PROTEIN that kills you
[2:08:06] <%ssjklyco> It's battery acid
[2:08:07] <Sp3ctre48> You can still sex him at least, that seems to be fine
[2:08:07] <aiutare47> You have a compromised immune system too Paige!
[2:08:08] <TheSaltminer> MINT is dextro
[2:08:08] <otakon17> Turian food is poisonous to humans
[2:08:08] <PinkSocks> Do NOT consume the turian chalice
[2:08:09] <@PeachSaliva> What if Garrus does a big cum in your butthole
[2:08:11] <%DJFakie> Garrus has to research how to do it safely
[2:08:12] <mak0t0yukii> Even the Nut?
[2:08:16] <@PeachSaliva> Do you die if he cum
[2:08:17] <%bassoontyphoon> Especially the gamer goo
[2:08:18] <otakon17> just DON'T INGEST
[2:08:19] <BlackStarAura> WORTH IT
[2:08:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Ever wonder why theres no Turian women
[2:08:20] <%LouieRouie> Urine is NOT sterile
[2:08:22] <%captain_thickthighs> So just pull out
[2:08:22] <+LionKagura> LUL
[2:08:23] <Profmcstevie> Die by nut
[2:08:23] <heartlesshealer> Yes
[2:08:24] <%QueequegTheater> By that logic, fucking Tali should kill you but it doesn't
[2:08:26] <+RoByte2> "Turians based on dextro-amino acids. Human ingestion of tissue could provoke allergic reactions. Anaphylactic shock possible, so don't.... (ahem) ingest."
[2:08:26] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva you could
[2:08:26] <intylerwe_trust> Man a relationship between Sheppard and Garrus doesn’t make much since
[2:08:27] <TourettesPlays> @PeachSaliva imagine
[2:08:29] <AluxStreams> god no
[2:08:29] <peachy996> @PeachSaliva Wrap it up
[2:08:29] <+Alopekis> Wait
[2:08:30] <heartlesshealer> Dead if cum in your bussy
[2:08:30] <SiameseSneeze> they can fuck, they just gotta be careful of fluids IIRC
[2:08:31] <%DJFakie> Jesus, Paige!
[2:08:32] <%king_wragles> @arkv01 As long as the pullout game is strong, yes
[2:08:32] <%Raikouija> IF U INGEST PAIGE
[2:08:33] <%Puhff> @PeachSaliva yes
[2:08:34] <%psidefx> Probably
[2:08:35] <ScreamLord> Real science says Turian and Quarian stuff won't kill you. And in fact won't interact with your biology at all
[2:08:37] <%skeleklng> @PeachSaliva Literally, unironically that question was answered in 2
[2:08:37] <%LumberjackJack> It's my headcanon that Mordin is responsible for Shepard and Garrus/Tali not dying after sexy-times due to his medical advice
[2:08:37] <Broken_Sonex> @PeachSaliva ALL fluids count Paige
[2:08:37] <notsoy> if he nuts inside you you'll probably die...especially you @PeachSaliva
[2:08:38] <KeystoneA2> Kissing Drell is like dropping acid; their saliva will give you psychadelic effects
[2:08:39] <%QueequegTheater> YOUR SKIN AUTOMATICALLY INGESTS, THAT'S HOW MEMBRANES WORK
[2:08:40] <Zeif00> Yeah you die from Garrus nut FeelsBadMan
[2:08:40] <%WutangchickeN> if you let a turian and a quarian double team you does it cancel out the toxicity???
[2:08:40] <+senfood> Rachni Queen is cute! CUTE!
[2:08:42] <+Alopekis> How does having sex with Garrus/Tali not kill Shepard?
[2:08:43] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean you're basically butt-chugging it at that point
[2:08:46] <%captain_thickthighs> Death by bukkake cannon
[2:08:47] <James_Quivers> PAIGE WOULD YOU DIE IF YOU PUT POISON IN YOUR BUTTHOLE
[2:08:48] <Ultimatefool> @PeachSaliva It's like drinking alcohol through your bum
[2:08:48] <%Retinolgaming> @PeachSaliva You get mary jane'd in that one spiderman comic.
[2:08:48] <%DianaTheAscian> So can he be the pul out king?
[2:08:50] <otakon17> NOW GET THOSE TURRETS UP
[2:08:50] <peachy996> @PeachSaliva Or he is the pullout king
[2:08:51] <JetpackMcQuack> BibleThump fuck this universe
[2:08:54] <%Maids4lyfe> Paige you would die from Turian jizz
[2:08:56] <heartlesshealer> INTESTINAL CONTACT IS ALSO INGESTION. THOSE MEMBRANES ABSORB
[2:08:58] <aiutare47> @QueequegTheater do you ever actually band though?
[2:08:58] <huskarl_zap> you mean heatsinks
[2:09:00] <SaltyAzteca> 30 SECONDS BUDDY
[2:09:00] <%JoshManVGH> @peachsaliva If he doesn't shoot his load into a love glove, the game is over
[2:09:03] <mr_mister0> SPEAKING OF PEE
[2:09:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Fucking Tali Doesn't kill you because you can take a special qurain fuck juice to fuck her
[2:09:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> It's only a mild case of severe anaphylaxis. Just mainline some epinephrine.
[2:09:05] <%zyberion626> @patstaresat the game got that wrong. dextro-amino acids won't kill you. hell sugar and mint are dextro
[2:09:06] <Dunmarkh> smoke with your helmet on?
[2:09:08] <%skeleklng> How do you pull magazines for guns that have infinite ammo????????
[2:09:08] <%Jeemukun> HOW WOULD YOU SMOKE
[2:09:09] <intylerwe_trust> I think ME2 says Tali had something installed
[2:09:09] <otakon17> there's a control panel SOMEWHERE
[2:09:10] <%Puhff> ...smoke inside your spacesuit???
[2:09:11] <%DJFakie> Turret connection in the back
[2:09:11] <kefka_himself> did they fixed the glitch that allowed you to equip heavy armor  regardles of the training?
[2:09:12] <intestinal_bleeding> Oof
[2:09:13] <%Varlinator> YOU'RE WEARING HELMETS?!
[2:09:13] <%QueequegTheater> @aiutare47 yes
[2:09:14] <Samurai_Tchan> @PeachSaliva no
[2:09:16] <+OG_M_Bison> Yo anybody wanna go lick Drell after this to get high?
[2:09:16] <@PeachSaliva> So does Garrus pull out or?
[2:09:20] <%bassoontyphoon> Smoke???
[2:09:23] <%TheDugness> prretty
[2:09:24] <%chance_h> Leaky time
[2:09:26] <BlackStarAura> Mako + Turrets
[2:09:28] <$hattrick61> As long as you dont ingest it should just be a rash
[2:09:33] <SaltyAzteca> HERE THEY COME
[2:09:34] <%DJFakie> Got one or two waves to fight
[2:09:34] <Broken_Sonex> @PeachSaliva If he's a king yes
[2:09:36] <%skeleklng> @PeachSaliva Your ship's doctor in 2 literally gives you meds so Garrus can nut in you
[2:09:36] <%DJFakie> Then talk to lady again
[2:09:38] <%GarbageNirvana> Just keep an epipen at the side of the bed and have him hit you with it when he nut
[2:09:40] <intylerwe_trust> Sheppard has to get a towel I presume
[2:09:41] <peachy996> Did you know the Krogan drink Ryncol can actually liquify your insides
[2:09:43] <mak0t0yukii> Do you die if he nuts on you
[2:09:44] <DatAsuna> "I'll hook up your defenses" *robs them*
[2:09:46] <TourettesPlays> This is one of the best side quests in the game I wish they were all this good
[2:09:47] <JetpackMcQuack> Sounds like paige just found a reason to play ME3
[2:09:47] <otakon17> I eman your OWN weapons are more than enough and the rocket turrets help
[2:09:55] <heartlesshealer> @PeachSaliva it's thought that he pulls out and also Mordin gives you some meds to help ease the results
[2:10:09] <%Maids4lyfe> Garrus mates like a fish, you lay your clutch of eggs and he ejects his cloud of semen on them upstream to spawn later
[2:10:11] <James_Quivers> Garrus puts the jizz in a hazmat container
[2:10:16] <intylerwe_trust> Don’t forget Tali had technology installed to have sex with Sheppard in 2
[2:10:19] <Ultimatefool> Wow this is riveting gameplay
[2:10:19] <Dunmarkh> wow those anthills look like shit
[2:10:24] <+Alopekis> This is Wrex's kind of mission.
[2:10:26] <AluxStreams> Yeah Mordin hooks you up with drugs that let you bone your alien bf/gf.
[2:10:27] <JetpackMcQuack> Consulting doctors about sexual partner RP
[2:10:30] <%QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva if you don't romance him in 2 he cucks you in 3
[2:10:31] <SaltyAzteca> "Sympathy for the devil plays"
[2:10:34] <peachy996> All you do is risk anaphyltic shock if you swallow garrus fluids. Heavy Risk but the Priz
[2:10:38] <otakon17> you'll get XP at the end of the mission
[2:10:38] <%zyberion626> @peachsaliva he's not toxic, he would just cause an allergic reaction
[2:10:40] <hat_under_bread> The lack of recoil on Tali's pistol is disconcerting.
[2:10:40] <+cunningchaff> oh my god tali's arms don't even move when she shoots
[2:10:43] <%WutangchickeN> you could fuck tali in 2???  I thought that was only 3

[2:11:05] <%Raikouija> Tali best girl fight me
[2:11:06] <Pookiedaexzile> WHY WOULD YOU NEED AMMO
[2:11:08] <%QueequegTheater> @WutangchickeN she bangs Garrus if you don't bang in 2
[2:11:09] <%Varlinator> What IS ammo? Wrong game lady
[2:11:09] <Rei_Dsoto> I thought Ammo was supposed to be funciontally infinite
[2:11:09] <+Alopekis> I don't get how Shepard can't extract them on the Normandy.

[2:11:23] <aiutare47> @PeachSaliva From the wiki: "When Mordin notices Shepard's attraction to Garrus, Shepard can ask him for advice regarding the turian, to which Mordin will warn Shepard about "chafing". He advises her not to ingest turian tissue, as it is based on dextro-amino acids, and can cause an allergic reaction in Shepard's body. He then suggests that she return later for a painkiller and forwards information packets regarding turian physiology and positions comfortable for both species to Shepard's room."

[2:22:43] <plaguedoctor_syan> i mean if you could be remade would ask for hair?
[2:22:43] <HoxtonSaltySlightlyBurned> The bald is engraved on his soul, so even though they tried to give him hair, it fell out in hours.
[2:22:43] <%emperordread> Miranda says that you had to be rebuilt as you are, right down to the morals
[2:22:45] <JetpackMcQuack> He should look like a ghoul from fallout
[2:22:45] <LluthyY> No, maintain the BALD
[2:22:46] <%Monkeyweed21> make the eyebrows the wrong color
[2:22:47] <%watts121> Miranda prefers her Shepard in blackface.
[2:22:53] <Profmcstevie> We can rebuild him....but I don't want to spend a lot of money
[2:22:53] <%Dfreddy8> 4 Billion dollars and with bad hair.
[2:22:53] <Pookiedaexzile> His Beard should get demoted to sideburns
[2:22:54] <%WutangchickeN> gotta go REVERSE BALD
[2:23:02] <%Mr_Pylon> Are humans the only race in Mass Effect with hair?
[2:23:08] <%warpath1911> restore the hairline for 2. miranda made you better lol
[2:23:13] <TioXyco> altaHEE
[2:23:17] <$hattrick61> imagine TIM and Miranda arguing about cosmetic changes
[2:23:21] <RaidenRising> LA HEE
[2:23:21] <fugly_nick> Quarians have hair, based on that Tali photo
[2:23:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Elcor?
[2:23:28] <$RealThiele> yea hair is expensive
[2:23:29] <%MelBrooksKA> I would assume by this time in the future, male pattern baldness would be solved
[2:23:33] <digaogrunge> Vorcha have no hair?
[2:23:34] <%JoshManVGH> Bad hair? I never asked for this!
[2:23:36] <fugly_nick> Don't know if thats still canon though
[2:23:37] <AluxStreams> I imagine a lot of them have very small hairs on their bodies.
[2:23:37] <peachy996> Quarians if you want to belive that picture of Tali
[2:23:37] <%TheGreatSkenardo> It's secret hair
[2:23:40] <dd44dostivei> elcor look fuzzy kinda
[2:23:43] <%WutangchickeN> it is my understanding that elcor have giant pubes
[2:23:45] <+Alopekis> Volus COULD have hair. We don't actually know.
[2:23:47] <%sunsetdisc0> we don't talk about that pat
[2:23:50] <%Puhff> the Volus MIGHT have hair but we'll never know
[2:23:53] <AluxStreams> I can see Batarians having super-soft eyebrows.
[2:23:58] <%SataruYamate> has he done bring down the sky yet?
[2:24:02] <%jillpilled> wonder if they changed that picture at all of Tali
[2:24:05] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> we dont acknowledge the stock photo fanfiction quarians
[2:24:08] <%GarbageNirvana> volus are basically mole people so
[2:24:10] <AluxStreams> :(
[2:24:13] <%LouieRouie> Volus are probably furry
[2:24:13] <$hattrick61> @jillpilled they did
[2:24:15] <+MightyDuckShoes> There should be a form of enbaldening for aliens. like Salarians being sensitive about their skin encrustation. or Krogans loosing their plates.
[2:24:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Whats the wrong ones called again
[2:24:17] <fugly_nick> They did change the photo in LE
[2:24:17] <AngryAsian5> The only good Batarian, is a dead batarian LUL
[2:24:18] <+Alopekis> @jillpilled Yes. It's not a stock photo now.
[2:24:18] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Are batarians just the Ferengi?
[2:24:20] <%dankjerri> cheer500 I didn't miss the stream, just getting a work truck that wasnt falling apart and poppin into Porp's stream. hope you had a big good day today, Pote.
[2:24:20] <ape_hawk> turians probably have huge amounts of bush, though
[2:24:20] <%NopeBadguy> thats racist
[2:24:20] <SaltyAzteca> How scummy are they!
[2:24:20] <peachy996> @jillpilled They did actaully
[2:24:28] <%emperordread> Ashley was just space racist to the wrong races
[2:24:30] <%chance_h> Yes
[2:24:31] <DSD24> Their introduction in this game is literally killing an entire planet
[2:24:32] <DatAsuna> pat taking a bold pro racism stance
[2:24:33] <%LumberjackJack> D:
[2:24:37] <SaltyAzteca> wtf LUL
[2:24:38] <%dankjerri> in the MOUTH
[2:24:39] <aiutare47> he's not wrong
[2:24:40] <nuane> ok Patrick
[2:24:42] <%knight1210> racist
[2:24:42] <+Alopekis> Why do all the alien races have 3 fingers?
[2:24:42] <%miguelrod777> Jesus pat
[2:24:42] <AluxStreams> Batarians are the Klingon, but if the Klingon explicitly did crimes.
[2:24:43] <stantheman_97> genophage the batarians
[2:24:44] <Essixian> @sashagreenspiderqueen Tali is purple and has weirdly cute mandible jaws and you can't tell me otherwise
[2:24:44] <$RealThiele> well then
[2:24:44] <%JoshManVGH> Jesus lord
[2:24:45] <%knight1210> WTF
[2:24:45] <ioci2112> if ashley was racist against batarians I wouldn't mind
[2:24:45] <+senfood> PATRICK
[2:24:46] <DSD24> Batarians were cool in the multiplayer
[2:24:46] <peachy996> Okay Ashley
[2:24:47] <%MidnightBurst12> jesus, pat
[2:24:47] <%ArcanumArcanum> mooooo
[2:24:48] <%Ranryu692> what if I shoot the baby in the mouth with my boner? Wait...
[2:24:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> "4 eyes? Sure demise."
[2:24:49] <%WutangchickeN> Okay ashley
[2:24:49] <%dankjerri> the mouth isnt big enough for bullet
[2:24:49] <%W1nterTitan> wtf was that
[2:24:52] <$hattrick61> I imagine the volus are like badger people
[2:24:53] <Pookiedaexzile> What about teh methhead worm people tho huh
[2:24:54] <James_Quivers> EVen when you can play them in ME3 MP, they use OMNI NETS and HARPOON GUNS, bunch of assholes
[2:24:55] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Pat's coming around to Ashley's way of thinking
[2:24:55] <%MelBrooksKA> No?
[2:24:55] <+Alopekis> What the hell was that sound? I've never heard that before.
[2:24:56] <+alphonseisbest> YES
[2:24:57] <fugly_nick> Thought that sound was Zangief
[2:24:58] <+alphonseisbest> GOOD
[2:24:59] <peachy996> Rachni Song
[2:25:00] <%NocturneNovember> okay that was the stream
[2:25:01] <+MightyDuckShoes> I bet Batarians babies look like koalas...four eyed koalas that will shank you in the night.
[2:25:01] <digaogrunge> the cow?
[2:25:01] <%AncelDeLambert> when I think of a Volus outside of its suit, for some reason I picture a catfish
[2:25:01] <dd44dostivei> batarians are for safe racism-play. it's weird.
[2:25:01] <BlackStarAura> Damn
[2:25:02] <+TehPostman> @DatAsuna more like a Bald Racist Stance
[2:25:03] <%sabertoothzombie> that's fucked up
[2:25:03] <%NopeBadguy> i bet ashley loves batarians
[2:25:07] <Essixian> @ioci2112 Batarians are the only ones who deserve racism
[2:25:11] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> is there even one actively good batarian in the entire game
[2:25:11] <stormhawk9891> That was the Rachni song
[2:25:12] <%NocturneNovember> I thought that was my phone
[2:25:14] <Profmcstevie> Splinter group....rachni....I guess
[2:25:17] <Dunmarkh> Shooting baby battarians is paragon
[2:25:22] <%Rumbutt> the Rachni Everywhere Systems
[2:25:27] <%AncelDeLambert> you mean the gobolins?
[2:25:29] <aiutare47> did the vorcha do anything wrong?
[2:25:30] <%miguelrod777> some if the vorcha are cool
[2:25:31] <Manderfuzz> I mean they're more like rats
[2:25:31] <fugly_nick> Vorcha, the ones who are literally Doom Imps
[2:25:31] <AluxStreams> The Vorcha are pure and devoid of hatred.
[2:25:32] <dd44dostivei> and reapers
[2:25:32] <+Alopekis> Vorcha mean well. They're just not good in social situations.
[2:25:32] <%AncelDeLambert> the ones with web skin?
[2:25:33] <%CalderGaming> I FORGOT ABOUT THOSE
[2:25:34] <%Rumbutt> Vorcha are cute demon goblins, they get a pass
[2:25:36] <Essixian> Vorcha are practically just clever animals, they don't count
[2:25:36] <+Bogart4321> to counter battarian racism we racism back
[2:25:36] <$Faustgesicht> but they funny
[2:25:37] <peachy996> The Vorcha are regarded as pests
[2:25:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Yeah the Vorcha. The Methhead worms
[2:25:39] <%Varlinator> I agree. This is 1 rachnii mission too many IMO
[2:25:39] <%TheGreatSkenardo> I have to say these Rachnai aren't looking very threatening as a galactic concern.
[2:25:39] <Broken_Sonex> Nah, they're just stupid
[2:25:40] <+alphonseisbest> @sashagreenspiderqueen there isn't even one in the whole series
[2:25:40] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Batarians HATE Humans bruh
[2:25:41] <spuginky> what about the Protheans?
[2:25:41] <televisedrevolting> Vorcha know no alternative, but war.
[2:25:42] <AluxStreams> They live only to eat, shit and sleep.
[2:25:43] <%SirGO0SE> the main Vorcha guy is so cool though
[2:25:44] <%W1nterTitan> Sapient NY city rat.
[2:25:45] <%Garthunox> the plot twist of the rachni clone? or the plot twist of finding the queen you freed
[2:25:46] <+vaderxyz1970> They are different?
[2:25:47] <CosmicApe13> both of them should be killed
[2:25:48] <%dankjerri> grubbin race
[2:25:50] <+GobbleLynn> don't slanderize goblins just because vorcha suck
[2:25:53] <%jillpilled> Just like Batarians!
[2:25:55] <%charp35> Aren't they only in 2?
[2:25:56] <+MightyDuckShoes> I have the terminus goblin space area. it was just a place filled with canonfodder
[2:25:56] <%WutangchickeN> BORN TO DIE
[2:25:56] <%Mr_Pylon> here kill these non-sapient bipedal not robots
[2:25:56] <DatAsuna> the vorcha are so born to die that one of them LITERALLY DIES in the filming of the blasto movie and nobody cares
[2:25:57] <+OG_M_Bison> Couldn't you say the same about Batarians tho? @PatStaresAt
[2:25:57] <James_Quivers> They aren't evil, they don't even have the capacity for morality, unlike Batarians
[2:25:59] <+Alopekis> Yes you can
[2:25:59] <peachy996> BAH COLLECTORS WANT PLAAAGUE OF GRIPES
[2:26:01] <%NocturneNovember> Vorcha only live like 20 years
[2:26:03] <ape_hawk> oh god, vorcha ARE just methhead aliens
[2:26:03] <%W1nterTitan> yes you are
[2:26:03] <+Alopekis> He's just kind of pissy with you
[2:26:04] <DSD24> In ME2 you can
[2:26:05] <%watts121> dude you can talk to a lot of Vorcha
[2:26:05] <+unhuggable1> you are
[2:26:06] <RetributionP> incorrect
[2:26:06] <AluxStreams> You can talk to one Vorcha but he tells you to go away.
[2:26:06] <peachy996> You can
[2:26:06] <yeildingthought> The vorcha are hyenas LUL
[2:26:07] <%JoshManVGH> "Hang on, gotta summon some demons from Dragon Age"
[2:26:07] <aiutare47> But did they even do anything? Like lorewise the batarians are MEGA EVIL, but the Vorcha, I dont think they are even mentioned in the lore
[2:26:08] <%Canti510> WRONG
[2:26:09] <nuane> you do talk to them, they speak bullet
[2:26:09] <%BigCoffee> You do talk to 1 vorcha
[2:26:09] <%emperordread> You do speak to one, he tells you to go away
[2:26:10] <%watts121> They are usually cool.
[2:26:10] <peachy996> In 3
[2:26:11] <%AncelDeLambert> I think one of them growls at you for a hostage situation
[2:26:12] <stantheman_97> apparently if vorcha are rasied outside their society they grow up not evil
[2:26:13] <DatAsuna> You do talk to 2 vorcha on omega
[2:26:13] <+unhuggable1> theres one in the markets
[2:26:13] <ioci2112> vorcha are violent, but their whole society is based on violence, if they raise them separated from that they are fine, batarians are just assholes, their whole society is space north korea, plus terrorism and slavery
[2:26:15] <Abyssal_Grave> They're fun to play as in ME2 multiplayer, as far as I remember.
[2:26:15] <aiutare47> yes you can
[2:26:16] <+Alopekis> I don't think so
[2:26:16] <%BigCoffee> no
[2:26:16] <%Canti510> no
[2:26:16] <+D00msDayDan> you talk to precisely a single vorcha on omega
[2:26:17] <aiutare47> Omega
[2:26:17] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> you talk to a vorcha in 2 and then kill them @PatStaresAt
[2:26:18] <digaogrunge> Youcan in ME2 and 3
[2:26:19] <+unhuggable1> yes
[2:26:20] <DatAsuna> No
[2:26:20] <%strugglepunk2> strugglepunk2 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 30 month streak! I'm really glad that i tune in, on this, the thirtieth month i've been subscribed to my favorite content creator, Patrick Boivin, only to hear him talking about how we should shoot batarian babies to get our dicks hard. Love you Pat.
[2:26:22] <$Faustgesicht> no
[2:26:23] <peachy996> In 3 you meet one semi reasonable Vorcha
[2:26:23] <DSD24> Hmm he walks away
[2:26:23] <+alphonseisbest> There is one in the DLC in 3 and you can kill him
[2:26:24] <$SGrim> Yes
[2:26:25] <aiutare47> There the sick vorcha on omega
[2:26:25] <+alphonseisbest> Yes
[2:26:25] <%Varlinator> No
[2:26:25] <Mattais88> Let's make three different merc squads so they can be killed indiscriminately.
[2:26:28] <%emperordread> No, he tells you to go away then goes away himself
[2:26:28] <%Garthunox> no
[2:26:30] <DatAsuna> He's just on the street
[2:26:30] <$hattrick61> theresike 3
[2:26:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Mass Effect 4 NEw Vorcha
[2:26:31] <+Alopekis> Yes
[2:26:32] <AngryAsian5> There is a vorcha in ME3 that is pretty cool LUL
[2:26:33] <%SirGO0SE> i spaced out and thought you meant Vorta from DS9 LUL
[2:26:34] <%afronooch> no
[2:26:34] <%BigCoffee> yes
[2:26:38] <James_Quivers> There is 1 productive member of society Vorcha in 3, so that's one more than Batarians
[2:26:39] <%jillpilled> Well there is one that walks away
[2:26:40] <%JoshManVGH> You can but you big die
[2:26:40] <DatAsuna> ME3 also has unkillable vorcha
[2:26:41] <aiutare47> I think so? the sick one?
[2:26:41] <peachy996> In 3
[2:26:41] <digaogrunge> yes
[2:26:42] <%BigCoffee> you can let at least 1 live
[2:26:43] <Zebroneath> It's extra fucked, considering they only live for about 20 years
[2:26:44] <+alphonseisbest> Yes .
[2:26:45] <ape_hawk> yeah, if you prefer to punch or biotic them instead
[2:26:45] <aiutare47> Yes
[2:26:46] <%Dfreddy8> You can talk to multiple but not that much dialogue.
[2:26:48] <+BigChiefBear> you can play as one in the coop
[2:26:51] <%AncelDeLambert> aren't there a bunch on the streets of the Hut Planet place with the hot Asari mobster that just chill?
[2:26:53] <+Alopekis> He's hanging out in Omega and is non-hostile.
[2:26:55] <+BigChiefBear> which was under rated
[2:26:55] <%kyh9> The Vorcha, Batarians and Krogans are ironically the most fun to play as in Multiplayer
[2:26:55] <%WutangchickeN> they give you the option to launch vorcha babies out of airlocks
[2:26:58] <$hattrick61> Theres one in the citadel DLC that talks about the multiplayer
[2:27:00] <DatAsuna> Mass Effect 3 has actor vorcha
[2:27:04] <%kyh9> Batavian Vanguard?  Fucking chefs kiss
[2:27:05] <televisedrevolting> There's a fanfic that depicts the life of a singular vorcha and is horrific and sad, but also not canon.
[2:27:11] <+BigChiefBear> i was like 5th in canada for score on the coop lol
[2:27:11] <AluxStreams> Vorcha have Giorno Giovanna heads.
[2:27:13] <nuane> ME4 needs Batarian, Vorcha, and Rachni squadmates
[2:27:15] <Essixian> VORCHA ARE BORING, LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO FINALLY SOLVE THE BATARIAN PROBLEM
[2:27:18] <Broken_Sonex> Man.....i forgot Vorcha can only live for 20 years.....
[2:27:23] <+Stormzcales_Lair> dem lock doors LUL
[2:27:27] <%skeleklng> You remember the stupid Merc group that look like Power Rangers
[2:27:27] <+MightyDuckShoes> I loved the Batarians with the spike tech holograms. It was fun to pop those
[2:27:30] <%kyh9> Batarian as based
[2:27:34] <AthenaAegis> Shepard the Orkin Man Kappa
[2:27:35] <yeildingthought> @essixian LUL
[2:27:37] <peachy996> @televisedrevolting I think I read  that one, it was well done
[2:27:44] <Mr_Taters > @hattrick61 I completely forgot about the characters talking about the multiplayer lol
[2:27:51] <+LemonyLilly> whats up pat and chat
[2:27:52] <%GarbageNirvana> If only them batarians liked blitzball eh brudda
[2:27:58] <%NocturneNovember> Plague finally got good internet!
[2:27:59] <aiutare47> In ME3MP the playable Vorcha gets a flamethrower omnitool, and the playable Batarian is a sentinel but instead of holo armor its KNIFE ARMOR
[2:28:04] <Blank9> shepard sounding like hank hill
[2:28:06] <%DJFakie> Go kick their FAT ASSES

[2:35:07] <yeildingthought> News to me
[2:35:08] <peachy996> Your eyes didn't listen to us
[2:35:11] <%dankjerri> psaCrazy
[2:35:13] <%skeleklng> You think they chose specifically a Batarian world you nuke in Arrival because otherwise the consequences would be too grave
[2:35:15] <%DJFakie> You can still do it but now you have to hit 90% Renegade instead of 80%
[2:35:16] <Pookiedaexzile> He knows in his tiny heart
[2:35:17] <tanarath> Oh yeah, there's a branching renegade/paragon quest isn't there?
[2:35:34] <ChaosedStar> @CalderGaming yupe, it totally sucks. They don't have a wide range of service. I miss it greatly.
[2:35:42] <%afronooch> yeah the "Save the biotics but dont hurt the scientists" is the paragon only
[2:35:48] <peachy996> That's already way too close
[2:35:49] <ape_hawk> oh cool, we The Expanse now

[2:36:02] <Wolfstriker121> i loved this mission so fucking much
[2:36:03] <%Varlinator> Look how cool the Normandy looks!
[2:36:04] <%MidnightBurst12> people have no imagination
[2:36:06] <%watts121> Let the space cajuns die!

[2:36:44] <Essixian> SPACE IS BIG PAT
[2:36:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> That's my default name when generating a world in any game
[2:36:49] <%Eilocke> yeah that's weirdly common
[2:36:49] <%SaiyanShoto> What are you? A space science man?
[2:36:51] <Pookiedaexzile> SHUT UP
[2:36:51] <%mike2hands> TRUE
[2:36:51] <tanarath> YEP
[2:36:51] <ScreamLord> It's already too late
[2:36:52] <+RoByte2> Planet Namek will explode in 5 minutes!
[2:36:56] <%dekkitout> Now how confident are you at orbital physics?
[2:36:56] <%jillpilled> no shhh bideogame though
[2:37:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> have you considered that you have no concept of scale in space?
[2:37:07] <%DJFakie> This DLC starts the trend of "we're only paying Shepard and the DLC actors for voices, so your squad has nothing"
[2:37:07] <%Monkeyweed21> you mean JJ abrams not understanding how big space is
[2:37:09] <%warpath1911> @thevoiceofcheese no that was arrival when shepard dropped the meteor in the mass realy
[2:37:11] <JetpackMcQuack> maff
[2:37:14] <%mike2hands> let space being space
[2:37:16] <%Varlinator> IT'S SLOW, BUT IT'S FAST
[2:37:20] <DSD24> Wait this was DLC?
[2:37:21] <SaltyAzteca> @RoByte2 Earth time or space time?
[2:37:27] <DSD24> I thought it was just a cool mission
[2:37:29] <+Gespens> Knights of Sidonia handled it in a fairly fun way: "It will hit us in 24 hours!" "OH NO! THATS GOING FAST!" and like, it manages to make 24 hours feel right
[2:37:31] <TungstenViper> Lori Alan?
[2:37:31] <%dankjerri> shoot the gun
[2:37:32] <mr_mister0> i dont remember this dlc
[2:37:33] <akitanito> oh no it's an axis drop
[2:37:35] <%Agami23> you know what bothers me way more? when people have a distress signal or a communication and they wisper
[2:37:37] <+pre10cious_1> Mako no bueno
[2:37:38] <Pookiedaexzile> This was PAID DLC
[2:37:42] <peachy996> It was during the primitive days of DLC
[2:37:42] <%skeleklng> Is this the first time we're introduced to Batarians?
[2:37:48] <%Varlinator> This was $10 US? Hmm
[2:37:52] <%ExpressNode> It doesn't have a timer?
[2:37:55] <+LemonyLilly> wouldn't disabling the torches do nothing to stop the asteroid, since in space, things have no natural deceleration?
[2:37:56] <fritz_dacat> Maybe things are just slower In space.
[2:37:58] <$KnivesEve> didnt know 1 had dlc
[2:37:59] <%emperordread> This was accidentilly the first place I went to when I picked LE up, had no idea it was DLC
[2:37:59] <stantheman_97> people often don't understand that SPACE IS FUCKING HUGE
[2:38:11] <%weissguard> oh yeyeye I dead this part the other day. Was pretty cool to look around and stuff
[2:38:12] <peachy996> I don't remember if Pinnacle Station was first or last
[2:38:15] <%DJFakie> They give it to you for free with Greatest Hits, at least?
[2:38:18] <yeildingthought> @lemonylilly I thought the same thing LUL
[2:38:18] <+MightyDuckShoes> it was DLC and they leveraged making the Batarians complete bastards in the main game so you would have a bloodlust to kick their asses for 10 USD
[2:38:23] <%Varlinator> It has 1 new building
[2:38:26] <+Pequod1> @LemonyLilly it's probably caught in the orbit so it needs to go fast to escape
[2:38:31] <Essixian> @stantheman_97 Dude space is SO fucking huge
[2:38:42] <%dankjerri> space is rather large
[2:38:44] <%luftraumm1> isnt this mission timed or some such shit?
[2:38:47] <%dankjerri> almost infinite, even
[2:38:48] <+LemonyLilly> ah i'll take the orbit
[2:38:48] <akitanito> it would be better to break up the asteroid and hope the thrusters will send it off course
[2:38:49] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah
[2:38:50] <%Garthunox> go inside
[2:38:50] <%skeleklng> I forgot if Batarians ever appeared in ME1 outside of this DLC
[2:38:50] <+LemonyLilly> that makes sense
[2:38:52] <%Varlinator> Inside
[2:38:54] <%slimmixrp> The buildinh?
[2:38:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> @lemonylilly Maybe it's on an acceleration trajectory to impact. It'll whiff without all that thrust.
[2:38:58] <%DJFakie> Pinnacle Station was released 18 months later
[2:38:58] <%JoshManVGH> In the base there is a button
[2:39:02] <+pre10cious_1> Space is Yuge
[2:39:05] <yeildingthought> We’re doomed LUL
[2:39:07] <%dankjerri> wreck their shit
[2:39:11] <$KnivesEve> space is disturbingly huge
[2:39:15] <Essixian> GUYS DID YOU KNOW THAT SPACE IS REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY GODDAMN BIG
[2:39:19] <akitanito> oh she ded
[2:39:19] <peachy996> Actually before this DLC Batarians looked way different
[2:39:20] <leinadtonu> How big is space tho?

[2:39:36] <%mike2hands> PUG PEOPLE!!!
[2:39:39] <%VHGS> that's not very space tolerant of him
[2:39:39] <%jillpilled> Even Shepards like "I'm not paragon enough to like Batarians"
[2:39:41] <%RonaldMcDownload> Oh good, the less-people aliens
[2:39:43] <+Punchasaur> EWWW

[2:40:04] <Shatterthought> @dankjerri no that was Cerberus
[2:40:06] <%snow_bush> You know whats worse than Reapers?  Batarians
[2:40:09] <%skeleklng> Based and Redpilled Ashley would like Batarians
[2:40:09] <DatAsuna> I forgot garrus' dad is in andromeda lol
[2:40:10] <%DJFakie> That would have leveled the building and the block around it

[2:40:50] <TungstenViper> Elves are fucking evil in the Witcher
[2:40:50] <James_Quivers> That's most universes that involve elves
[2:40:51] <ioci2112> elves are kinda dicks in the witcher
[2:40:56] <DatAsuna> Same with dragon age tbh, blame solas

[2:41:20] <James_Quivers> The elves start EVERY BAD THING In the warcraft universe
[2:41:21] <+pre10cious_1> #cancelLegalos
[2:41:22] <akitanito> I thought she got killed
[2:41:32] <+Pequod1> Okay it is weird to hear it out loud
[2:41:40] <AngryAsian5> Batarian Extremist is an oxymoron LUL
[2:41:40] <ScreamLord> Dragon Age Ancient Elves make Tevinter look like puppies
[2:41:40] <akitanito> why is she even whispering in a big room
[2:41:41] <peachy996> Wait wasn't Kate blonde?
[2:41:45] <+MightyDuckShoes> Well he's not exactly saying that. He said the other races knew to accept human supremacy.
[2:41:48] <stantheman_97> i don't know anything about witcher but I have a generally dislike of elves in fantasy for their uptight attitude
[2:41:50] <%Mr_Pylon> by Batarian extremists does she mean Batarians?
[2:41:52] <AngryAsian5> "Redunancy" I mean
[2:41:54] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt It's Witcher-canon that elf women cum uncontrollably when fucked by human men.
[2:41:57] <%chance_h> Witcher Elves are inter dimensional colonizers too so it’s alright to kill them
[2:42:04] <+MightyDuckShoes> not I the exact words but that was his idea of "peace"
[2:42:08] <tigo0donnell> @peachy996 Yeah, she was
[2:42:08] <%captain_thickthighs> The elves are supremacists in like every fiction
[2:42:13] <DracaenaLeaf> there's at least two small orbs on the bottom
[2:42:13] <%Monkeyweed21> WAIT EVEN IF YOU STOP THE ENGINES IT WONT SLOW DOWN
[2:42:18] <%LouieRouie> He looks weird without the orb
[2:42:19] <%BigCoffee> WAHAT!?
[2:42:20] <%mike2hands> WHA??
[2:42:20] <%DJFakie> "HEY."
[2:42:22] <Dunmarkh> LUL LUL
[2:42:22] <%RonaldMcDownload> Mass Effect Pat would be one of those round guys in the gimp suits.
[2:42:24] <DSD24> Patshepard is so pissed
[2:42:24] <SaltyAzteca> CANON
[2:42:24] <%Puhff> DansGame
[2:42:26] <%afronooch> they uh really know their audience
[2:42:27] <Essixian> @SGrim Oho
[2:42:29] <Slim_Lipid> LUL
[2:42:30] <peachy996> Paige would be busy looking at Garrus
[2:42:30] <%jillpilled> HEY >:(
[2:42:30] <nevan_44> LUL
[2:42:30] <SaltyAzteca> PAT IS SO OP ITS CANON
[2:42:31] <+Pequod1> Love that no sell
[2:42:35] <%mike2hands> no way??
[2:42:39] <ape_hawk> just tell her shepard has a girdle on or something
[2:42:39] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt yeah. Apparently Elf men have terrible dick-game, and even the most average human man drives them into a frenzy.
[2:42:40] <fugly_nick> Oh hey Brian Blum
[2:42:46] <%Agami23> honestly. elves gotta go in all fiction.
[2:42:47] <peachy996> And weird, wonder why they changed her hair actually I think I know why
[2:42:48] <aiutare47> without the orb hes just a trailer park regular
[2:42:51] <%chance_h> Omg the armor actually works
[2:42:51] <%Monkeyweed21> STOPPING THE ENGINES WONT SLOW DOWN THE ASTEROID THATS NOT HOW SPACE WORKS
[2:42:53] <%NateyBeak> @SGrim fuckn nice
[2:42:55] <DSD24> Wait its BJ?!
[2:42:56] <%skeleklng> @PatStaresAt It's canon that Elf-Women are unusually sexually compatible with Human Men and are more fertile with Humans compared to beta cuck elf men.
[2:42:58] <Pookiedaexzile> "Round Guys in the gimp suit" is the best thing I've ever read
[2:43:00] <%mike2hands> when orb is out charisma go down by 50%
[2:43:02] <%JoshManVGH> I really appreciate the canonical use of Kenetic Shields there.
[2:43:04] <peachy996> In Mass Effect Blonde Hair is a rarity
[2:43:06] <%NocturneNovember> I like Tim Rogers but he pronounces gif as "jiff" so that makes him a 7/10 for me. 7's for the video quality.
[2:43:07] <James_Quivers> You look good for a grandfather
[2:43:09] <Broken_Sonex> @SGrim I SEE.....!
[2:43:09] <JetpackMcQuack> bad things
[2:43:14] <Artemisky> what run is this?
[2:43:15] <%RonaldMcDownload> Good schools? It's where the white people live!  You've got to save it!
[2:43:15] <thetunnelhomer> Man I wish Shepard used his biotics in cutscenes more.
[2:43:19] <akitanito> "millions"
[2:43:19] <SaltyAzteca> Thats....pretty huge
[2:43:19] <DSD24> That's some weird Witcher lore
[2:43:20] <Slim_Lipid> @Monkeyweed21 nah the mass effect tho
[2:43:21] <ScreamLord> The worst elves of all time are the Eldar. Warhammer 40K's Space Elves
[2:43:27] <thetunnelhomer> Also this Elf Witcher lore is kinda nuts.
[2:43:28] <Hellarussian> that doesn't sound too bad
[2:43:32] <mr_mister0> "EVERYONE DIES, GOT?"
[2:43:33] <+D00msDayDan> but how may hiroshimas is that?
[2:43:34] <%Varlinator> Doesn't sound that bad
[2:43:37] <%MidnightBurst12> sounds like a fun time
[2:43:40] <%POUND_CAKE94> Oh baby I’m back in now
[2:43:41] <+RoByte2> Three paragraphs for "extinction level event"
[2:43:44] <fugly_nick> "Alien Bastards"
[2:43:48] <ape_hawk> lol "what if it lands in the water"
[2:43:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Fuck the Eldar, Long Live da Boys
[2:43:50] <TungstenViper> no:)
[2:43:52] <+LemonyLilly> probably biillions of hiroshimas
[2:43:53] <James_Quivers> WHAT IF LAND IN WATER THO? That's a dumb question lol
[2:43:54] <%dankjerri> he got REAL mad there a second
[2:43:54] <RaidenRising> TES elves are evil
[2:43:59] <xxshadowxx416> short on it everthing dead
[2:43:59] <peachy996> "You're too pessimistic"
[2:43:59] <ioci2112> what if it lands in the water
[2:44:00] <%Garthunox> @RoByte2 And?
[2:44:00] <RushUnplugged> @ScreamLord sounds like what a filthy mon-keigh would say
[2:44:01] <aiutare47> So dumb question but why have races not weaponized planetoids and meteors already then?
[2:44:02] <+MightyDuckShoes> that bit of lore is enough to let me know never to read the Witcher. Jesus Christ.
[2:44:02] <DSD24> Pat better pick the 3rd option
[2:44:04] <peachy996> Spider?
[2:44:06] <AngryAsian5> Even if you stopped all of the engines, its inertia would still send it careening into the planet.
[2:44:07] <%mike2hands> did you kill a fly?
[2:44:11] <%POUND_CAKE94> Oh I’ve never seen this part of the game
[2:44:12] <%ExpressNode> Tsunamis
[2:44:15] <akitanito> tsunami everywhere
[2:44:24] <fugly_nick> Patshep is contemplating
[2:44:34] <peachy996> Ah
[2:44:36] <tigo0donnell> @peachy996 Miranda was actually gonna be blonde to match her VA and basis for her face, Yvonne Strahovski
[2:44:36] <Broken_Sonex> @MightyDuckShoes COWARD
[2:44:40] <%NateyBeak> psaJpeg_SQ moth be like this now
[2:44:40] <%dankjerri> monsoon season?
[2:44:41] <%POUND_CAKE94> Dude remember that big wave planet from Interstellar
[2:44:41] <JetpackMcQuack> blow it up 4Head
[2:44:53] <%dekkitout> @RaidenRising Mostly- MOSTLY- the high elves. The Dark Elves are 50/50, Wood elves seem alright with their cannibalism, and the Orcs get shafted too often
[2:44:55] <akitanito> global sauna
[2:45:01] <%Agami23> this is a weird prequel to soma
[2:45:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> @angryasian5 You assume that it isn't doing a fancy curved intercept path that compensates for gravity and a moving target.
[2:45:06] <+MightyDuckShoes> @broken_sonex I can't imagine the cringe that would snap my spine in three places reading that in the actual books.
[2:45:08] <Hellarussian> how can it be
[2:45:12] <%Varlinator> Bad.
[2:45:12] <%dankjerri> the dark elves got colonized real hard
[2:45:13] <%POUND_CAKE94> It’s not gooooood
[2:45:25] <JetpackMcQuack> good rule
[2:45:27] <aiutare47> oh thats why
[2:45:30] <DSD24> This is our introduction to this Race
[2:45:30] <aiutare47> fair enough
[2:45:30] <$homelesstwinky> How could the dumbass Batarians be capable of this?
[2:45:31] <RaidenRising> yeah, high eleves are irl nazis in tes world
[2:45:32] <James_Quivers> BIG WAR CRIMES
[2:45:37] <Essixian> WHY WOULDN'T THEY THE FILTHY FOUR-EYED SCUM
[2:45:38] <ioci2112> they're not all like this, the thing is, they fucking are
[2:45:39] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> colony drop a motherfucker
[2:45:41] <peachy996> @tigo0donnell I remember Andersons friend is where its mentioned blondes are a rarity
[2:45:41] <ScreamLord> @RushUnplugged The Eldar literally Murder-Fucked a torture porn god into existence and it ripped a whole in the universe open that lets demons out and it killed 90% of their civilization.
[2:45:46] <TungstenViper> CONSPIRACY
[2:45:58] <%animaturgy> thier name is basically barbarians
[2:46:07] <%POUND_CAKE94> We’ll get those batarians back in about 1 game from now
[2:46:08] <%dekkitout> That's the Thalmor, but high elves are down with eugenics
[2:46:09] <%ItalianWaifu> Dark elves were also big slavers for agonians till they got their asses beat by them
[2:46:09] <peachy996> FUCK BALAK
[2:46:12] <vVAstrAVv> how many times will we get "not all shepherds"
[2:46:13] <RushUnplugged> @ScreamLord someone doesn't know how to have fun
[2:46:16] <%dankjerri> @screamlord and if they die without a rock they go to sex hell
[2:46:23] <%bread_assassin> We see "some" cool Batarians in this series, but do we ever see a cool Vorcha or are they all bad?
[2:46:24] <Pookiedaexzile> And the Orcs are bad guys for whaT? wanting people to pay the roads toll or be warned of  the consequences
[2:46:31] <DatAsuna> enemies everywhere?
[2:46:33] <peachy996> Also fuck the Blasting Cap run
[2:46:35] <akitanito> no shep, it's better to disable one or two and get it sent off course
[2:46:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> why would you use proximity sensors for mining?
[2:46:45] <fugly_nick> ME3's Omega DLC has a cool Vorcha
[2:46:46] <JetpackMcQuack> no :)
[2:46:56] <Broken_Sonex> @MightyDuckShoes C'mon, don't you know how to have fun?
[2:46:59] <RaidenRising> orcs are just war lords
[2:47:00] <%sunsetdisc0> we put the key behind the locked door, Shepard
[2:47:01] <%dekkitout> The orcs are "cannot catch a break/have nice things" personified
[2:47:07] <peachy996> stupid damn Proximity Minefield
[2:47:58] <%warpath1911> @peachy996 man i forgot how much that minefield sucks
[2:48:03] <James_Quivers> SHEPARD YOU DUMB FUCK
[2:48:04] <+MightyDuckShoes> @broken_sonex No. I haaate it.
[2:48:06] <Broken_Sonex> A A Ron
[2:48:12] <%Maids4lyfe> disco elysium has ruined me on dialogue trees, also what if you could make your character in ME to be just like Harry
[2:48:25] <ScreamLord> @dankjerri And The Age of Strife can also be blamed on the Eldar because their Death Orgies were making the Warm unstable while Slannesh was gestating and caused the Warp Storms that cut off Humanity's colonies.
[2:48:36] <%luckysteak> That is a really cool idea
[2:48:39] <JetpackMcQuack> You are a moon now, asteroid
[2:48:40] <DatAsuna> i too wish shepard was a communist
[2:48:40] <xxshadowxx416> that a bad idea
[2:48:42] <TungstenViper> Cake is a lie
[2:48:49] <supergoblinpunch> Its a Disasteroid
[2:48:56] <Pookiedaexzile> @Maids4lyfe Mass Effect 4 by VAUM
[2:48:57] <+MightyDuckShoes> why couldn't they just give us the multi? or make playable aliens I. the sequel game? think the multi will come back?
[2:49:00] <%dankjerri> @screamlord but they have cool robots so its fine
[2:49:19] <ScreamLord> lol
[2:49:20] <%Maids4lyfe> @Pookiedaexzile that's one way for EA to get my money
[2:49:30] <%POUND_CAKE94> Carnage go up
[2:49:32] <JetpackMcQuack> Pointing celestial objects at your home takes a lot of balls
[2:49:49] <DatAsuna> @MightyDuckShoes the real answer is the fired the entire sub studio of folks who made the multiplayer
[2:49:57] <%bassoontyphoon> Check a look
[2:50:01] <spuginky> see that mountain?
[2:50:07] <DatAsuna> and it would be hard to try and figure out how they made it in reverse
[2:50:09] <tigo0donnell> @mightyduckshoes Mac Walters did say if demand was high enough they would bring it back to ME3 in an update
[2:50:16] <+MightyDuckShoes> @datasuna Well that will do it. Damn.
[2:50:16] <Hellarussian> gravity is for suckers
[2:50:22] <iosephe> RAMP IT
[2:50:29] <stantheman_97> can't skyrim that
[2:50:30] <Profmcstevie> see that mountain? you can go there. Will it be fun or pleasant? HA
[2:50:31] <%WutangchickeN> is that dumbass mako any better
[2:50:38] <%POUND_CAKE94> Throw a pigskin a quarter-mile
[2:50:53] <%dankjerri> roll
[2:51:18] <JetpackMcQuack> We goin down
[2:51:23] <ioci2112> and gravity
[2:51:26] <+JaseAdrift> There is no way you are rolling that asteroid back
[2:51:27] <hat_under_bread> It's fine. The orbit is just decaying.
[2:51:28] <blue8moon> don't worry about it
[2:51:28] <DSD24> Maybe ME space is different
[2:51:37] <%ItalianWaifu> its cool the meteor read the script
[2:51:37] <%Ynkubus_> yeah but plot effect
[2:51:40] <+LemonyLilly> i think the excuse is that you're stopping the torches before the asteroid breaks orbit
[2:51:43] <Minorou> just use your biotic powers to make the asteroid's mass to zero
[2:51:51] <$dalmek> don't worry, you can convince it that those don't exist
[2:51:52] <James_Quivers> Noooo Gregor Mendel
[2:51:52] <aiutare47> To people who never played it, it must seem like ME3MP is all people talk about, but thats just because it was so much fun. I miss jetpack turians, or the teleporting ninjas, or the volus adept, or the geth hunter. So many awesome characters
[2:51:52] <Pookiedaexzile> If theirs a red  friction thing infront of you you're fucked
[2:51:52] <peachy996> Mendel huh?
[2:51:53] <ammobasket> What like a Mass Effect?
[2:51:54] <%dekkitout> Did I miss the reason why they didn't have something strong enough to shift it's course?
[2:51:56] <James_Quivers> Died for his epas
[2:52:01] <%LumberjackJack> You'd think they'd try to redirect the asteroid instead of just turning off the turbines. even then, it looks too late
[2:52:03] <hat_under_bread> Also, it's a cool skybox and that's more important.
[2:52:10] <CSeriesJTYPE> its simple pat, change the gravitational constant of the universe
[2:52:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> Orbital mechanics is complicated tho
[2:52:17] <akitanito> they didn't really think about physics
[2:52:25] <James_Quivers> *stares at camera*
[2:52:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Well Jay
[2:52:47] <+MightyDuckShoes> Shut Up Game! I'm trying to listen to Start Trek trivia!
[2:52:49] <+bugz_munny> *ZOOM IN*
[2:52:49] <%SirGO0SE> 4Head
[2:52:49] <$Ziegsy> has pat gotten quieter?
[2:52:53] <peachy996> Nods silntly
[2:52:53] <Ranger747> (Part 5 of 7)
[2:53:01] <%dekkitout> How'd they make it lighter?
[2:53:05] <stantheman_97> that's right pat
[2:53:10] <+bugz_munny> Very cool
[2:53:13] <%walternatorz> got any star wars anecdotes?
[2:53:13] <akitanito> *gasp*
[2:53:17] <%LumberjackJack> :O
[2:53:18] <James_Quivers> OH MY GAAAAAAWD
[2:53:19] <%ItalianWaifu> thats right Jay
[2:53:19] <peachy996> Cut to Jay thinking of some horror schlock
[2:53:24] <Essixian> STAR TREK WAS THE REAL MASS EFFECT ALL ALONG
[2:53:25] <%dekkitout> ...
[2:53:26] <+D00msDayDan> just affect its mass
[2:53:26] <awalbaru> Moon is a lie
[2:53:32] <Pookiedaexzile> That's Not all JAy
[2:53:32] <ioci2112> thanks mike
[2:53:33] <leinadtonu> ...
[2:53:35] <%walternatorz> could really use a star wars joke
[2:53:39] <xxshadowxx416> easyer way is to blow it up and it small is it burns up
[2:53:43] <%skeleklng> @PatStaresAt Should I bother to watch Voyager, I stopped watching after Year of Hell part 2 after realizing that it wasn't an entire season of nightmare fuel
[2:53:53] <dd44dostivei> but would picard kill everyone to refuse q's power to stop it?
[2:53:57] <+alphonseisbest> Can we talk about how ACTUALL REAL GODS ARE A THING IN START TREK?!
[2:53:59] <T_Sasquatch> @essixian to be fair mass effect is way more star trek than star wars
[2:54:01] <%emperordread> That's a good high note to end on
[2:54:05] <James_Quivers> You know Jay, those Batarians remind me of the Klingons from the Original Series of Star Trek
[2:54:05] <%wibbwobbler> Society of q
[2:54:10] <%skeleklng> ok cool thanks also what about enterprise
[2:54:13] <%LouieRouie> It would have worked if that cloud would have chilled for two seconds
[2:54:13] <%SirGO0SE> it gets bad but theres some good stuff towards the end
[2:54:17] <peachy996> I like Voyager but the writing wants me to stop liking Voyager
[2:54:18] <mikesumusprime> :( Voyager was my fav
[2:54:19] <%NateyBeak> Neelix Fucks tho. my homies and I love Neelix
[2:54:20] <%SirGO0SE> if youre a trek fan it might be all you have left
[2:54:22] <%Garthunox> pat i just stumbled on a gold mine for something in 14 that has nothing being sold, but its in high demand
[2:54:25] <+MightyDuckShoes> Voyager was my first Trek. I watched the whole thing. it got... weird.
[2:54:27] <%aWanderingKaivo> I prefer Star Gate, the third gender
[2:54:27] <+alphonseisbest> like Q's should be fuck worshipped
[2:54:28] <Essixian> THE MAKO EVERYONE
[2:54:28] <%Dfreddy8> Computer missed
[2:54:28] <James_Quivers> SI HERE I AM
[2:54:28] <leinadtonu> sick
[2:54:31] <uncle_emoji> Why doesn't Worf, as the largest Star Trek, not simply eat the rest of the crew?
[2:54:31] <%walternatorz> I need Pat to slip up and talk about Star Wars so he loses his bet.
[2:54:34] <%dekkitout> Do it again do it again
[2:54:34] <%emperordread> @alphonseisbest They are just wormhole aliens. Don't let the fools on Bajore tell you anything different
[2:54:35] <Pookiedaexzile> YEYEYEYEYEY
[2:54:36] <RedPlasticCup> PogChamp
[2:54:42] <peachy996> Some neat characters like Be'lanna Torres
[2:54:42] <Ranger747> baller
[2:54:43] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat will you watch season 2 of Star Trek Picard?
[2:54:51] <peachy996> Seven of Nine, Tuvok
[2:54:51] <T_Sasquatch> @garthunox im listening 👂
[2:54:53] <ammobasket> Sick flip
[2:54:57] <peachy996> Annnnnd that's it
[2:54:58] <%saiyanblitz> Nailed the landing
[2:55:04] <+alphonseisbest> @emperordread nah fuck those dushces, Im on about the Q's!
[2:55:15] <%Garthunox> @T_Sasquatch are you on the light dc?
[2:55:27] <+alphonseisbest> like a single Q could just remake Star trek in dbz if he wanted
[2:55:33] <T_Sasquatch> @garthunox yup Phoenix
[2:55:36] <tigo0donnell> I do kinda wish the LE came with the concept art, soundtrack, trailers, and bonus documentaries the 360 Platinum Hits version had. Even came with a cool Dashboard theme and Bring Down the Sky for free
[2:55:37] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[2:55:38] <%skeleklng> oh god remember that time Janeway went into the Q-verse and it was all one set about the civil war or something
[2:55:42] <$Faustgesicht> Just drive right in
[2:55:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Light Jog thru artillery
[2:55:46] <+Bogart4321> that's a cool beat
[2:55:51] <%Garthunox> @T_Sasquatch then never mind, this is my gold mine
[2:55:55] <+CookieCutter007> the long range shotgun
[2:55:55] <ioci2112> wrext just got destroyed
[2:55:56] <%LumberjackJack> LUL Casually jogging passed missiles
[2:56:14] <peachy996> Less prox mines than I remember
[2:56:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> that's no moon
[2:56:16] <+alphonseisbest> why is every single lifeform that meets Q not just making a whole ass religion out of him? like at LEAST you KNOW he's real!
[2:56:18] <T_Sasquatch> @garthunox sigh why would you bring it up
[2:56:21] <ape_hawk> did pat ever cash in his level up?
[2:56:27] <+LemonyLilly> x57? more like shepard's asteroid
[2:56:32] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @patstaresat hey I know this is a paragon LP but the council’s gotta go at the end right?
[2:56:33] <tigo0donnell> They actually improved this part, in the original you didn’t see on the minimap where the mines were, so it was a huge ass chore
[2:56:40] <%Garthunox> @T_Sasquatch to brag
[2:56:47] <+Punchasaur> Wait even if the thrusters turn off the asteroid will still go in the same direction
[2:56:55] <+Bogart4321> victimless murder
[2:56:55] <peachy996> @Gloom_Tangerine But the Replacement Council sucks though
[2:57:04] <Pookiedaexzile> That's also why they got the black eyes
[2:57:10] <Essixian> @Punchasaur Don't worry about it
[2:57:10] <Minorou> I think the devs had a contest to see who could make the most interesting interior using the same layout for this DLC
[2:57:14] <+LemonyLilly> the thrusters are there to break the asteroid's orbit, which they haven't yet
[2:57:16] <ioci2112> it's not genocide, it's pesticide
[2:57:20] <T_Sasquatch> How's that even possible
[2:57:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah just put the humans on their
[2:57:27] <DSD24> Always save the council
[2:57:28] <tigo0donnell> @gloom_tangerine Replacement council is arguably worse
[2:57:31] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @peachy996 do they? I don’t remember?
[2:57:33] <jorniev> TRUTH
[2:57:33] <DSD24> Even if they are dicks
[2:57:33] <AngryAsian5> Destiny Ascension also nets a hefty amount of points for ME3
[2:57:46] <%emperordread> Keep killing the councils until they stop forming them
[2:57:47] <%Garthunox> and then you die, and they try to bury everything you brought up
[2:57:53] <DSD24> Destiny Ascension is a cool ship too
[2:57:56] <mikesumusprime> the council is just the worst
[2:58:00] <DSD24> Look at these heroes
[2:58:03] <peachy996> Well think of it like this: That asshole Turian is replaced with a cool one but the cool Asari and Salarian are replaced with assholes
[2:58:07] <awalbaru> Theres even celestial bureaucracy
[2:58:07] <James_Quivers> Balak is just Kahn BTW
[2:58:08] <+kiradusk4200> dude the Conicle can eat ass had the assholes listened about Sovirgen they might have lived but the cost of saving them or actually fighting off a Reaper was to high to choose them
[2:58:09] <FirewallStorm> how about anarchism kids ;)
[2:58:13] <akitanito> that subtitle was weird
[2:58:15] <nuane> Its pretty funny that the robot race gets humanized in a game where humanoid alien races can get demonized for cannon fodder
[2:58:15] <%aWanderingKaivo> I forget, do we even see batarians outside of dlc in ME1?
[2:58:18] <peachy996> And the asshole Turian is an enjoyable asshole
[2:58:20] <+CherteuseKapibara> subs days early on that one
[2:58:25] <Pookiedaexzile> The Buthardagains
[2:58:27] <@PlagueOfGripes> Pat! I can watch your streams again! They still suck!
[2:58:27] <dd44dostivei> this man dies for nothing
[2:58:29] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt technically letting the council die gets you more score, but the replacement council is annoying so...
[2:58:36] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt btw, the game now saves properly at the end of the game so they dont ask you who you made councillor, cos the save file knows
[2:58:36] <$RealThiele> . . . whos shutting down the torches?
[2:58:39] <+D00msDayDan> hi plague!

[2:58:58] <ioci2112> I get me1 council, shepard is kinda asking for a lot, like "I got this weird vision, space cthulhu is coming to murder us all", me2 council is where it gets retarded, and me3 council hits the retarded wall head on
[2:58:59] <%RetroCop87> what's up @PlagueOfGripes , did you lose itnernet or soemthing?

[2:59:17] <theshillman> awww

[2:59:32] <%saadi90> Bromance
[2:59:35] <%SaiyanShoto> How do you know that's the first thing he did? He could've gone to watch furry porn first
[2:59:36] <Pookiedaexzile> How does Plague feel about Qurussy
[2:59:36] <meteor530> Why does the music sound so off?
[2:59:36] <DrStinkers> Now he can watch your stream and torrent porn at the same time
[2:59:38] <@PlagueOfGripes> now I can go back to... streaming danganronpa 2? FUCK
[2:59:39] <ChaosedStar> We are blessed by his presence
[2:59:42] <yeildingthought> @plagueofgripes AYE! Congrats on the good internet!
[2:59:48] <%Garthunox> Plague did you hear that Pat see's your friendship like that of Shephard and Wrex?
[2:59:48] <+bugz_munny> grats plague on advancing in civ eras
[2:59:50] <%MidnightBurst12> how romantic
[2:59:51] <%valriot> MILPOOL
[2:59:54] <leinadtonu> hehe
[2:59:55] <goodheartedjake> Ok so the council will green light sterilizing an entire race that THEY raised up as an army. But they leave the entire race of slavers alone.....
[2:59:56] <tanarath> Basically, DSL (not adsl, dsl) is 200 per month
[2:59:58] <Explodincatz> finally more star trek streams
[2:59:59] <%dekkitout> Why so many games?

[3:00:24] <theincrediblerick> i sleep in a racecar pat, what do you sleep in?
[3:00:24] <sky_lives_> fuck all those gsmes just play mass effect
[3:00:36] <%Gloom_Tangerine> Sorry for my comment about killing the council I just hate bureaucrats.
[3:00:36] <%RetroCop87> "Sunny" "Wrex"
[3:00:40] <+DeadlyPeaks> Yay. I miss the danganronpa lp
[3:00:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Plague is not wrex, Plague is Joker with more depression
[3:00:47] <dd44dostivei> i think it was 5 bucks???
[3:00:50] <+pre10cious_1> why did I have the bowl, Pat? why did I have the bowl?
[3:00:50] <peachy996> How much was Pinnacle Station
[3:00:52] <%dekkitout> I think someone made a joke of something Wrex said being "A very Plague thing to say"
[3:00:53] <James_Quivers> the early days of DLC were rough, man
[3:00:57] <Mattais88> DLC mako
[3:00:57] <%saadi90> EA...
[3:00:59] <plaguedoctor_syan> I heard they are going after people streming Dangan Ronpa, like after the first chapter
[3:01:02] <%Retinolgaming> Oh wow ninja gaiden master collection comes out, didn't know that.
[3:01:06] <fugly_nick> Tha Mako should have been improved. I miss it in 2 and 3
[3:01:08] <tigo0donnell> The Council is probably the most consistent in this game, Humans were only a part of the Galaxy 30 years, and were moving faster than any other species. Not to mention, even Shepard points out telling them his vision won’t work. Plus you were coming to them initially with little evidence. I’d say their main issue is underestimating Saren at the end tbh. But they become worse in 2.
[3:01:09] <ChaosedStar> It's sad there is no furry type aliens to bone.
[3:01:12] <%aWanderingKaivo> there's not really any big open like this planets in 2 outside of DLC though
[3:01:12] <James_Quivers> HORSE. ARMOR.
[3:01:19] <Profmcstevie> This was the horde armor era
[3:01:24] <thevoiceofcheese> It’s EA pat
[3:01:27] <awalbaru> True
[3:01:27] <Profmcstevie> thanks fuckers for normalizing awful dlc
[3:01:28] <RaidenRising> HORSE ARMOr
[3:01:29] <@PlagueOfGripes> wow I just had an intense flashback to playing ME1 and finding this building and the game bugging out and not letting me inside
[3:01:29] <%Ranryu692> multiplayer map packs were pretty much the only good dlc
[3:01:35] <0rnan> Horse armor and pay for mods.
[3:01:36] <$Ziegsy> I heard if you stream danganronpa youre put on a list somewhere
[3:01:39] <DSD24> Shivering Isles was pretty good though
[3:01:44] <tigo0donnell> That’s one of my biggest problems with 2, the lack of exploration compared to 1.
[3:01:46] <%RetroCop87> it was back in the day when they were still treating DLC as something that couldn't include story content
[3:01:51] <RLT917> Shivering Isles was pretty good for its time
[3:01:53] <+Punchasaur> I think the first dlc I ever bought was for fallout 3
[3:01:55] <xxshadowxx416> now there no dlc it in game store TPFufun
[3:01:56] <%Varlinator> @PatStaresAt I still say Pinnacle Station was wayyy more of a rip-off. $7USD for what is entirely worthless DLC.
[3:01:57] <peachy996> Yup
[3:01:59] <%LumberjackJack> $10 for 3 maps and allowed to still play ranked multiplayer. ugh.
[3:02:01] <SaltyAzteca> thanks EA
[3:02:04] <Blank9> me3 is nowhere near as bad as dead space 3
[3:02:04] <awalbaru> Yea
[3:02:04] <%justcallmebobplease> So do the Blade movies
[3:02:05] <James_Quivers> Some people say Shivering Isles as a counter point but I consider that an expansion pack
[3:02:06] <aiutare47> completely?
[3:02:06] <supergoblinpunch> Shivering Isles tho
[3:02:07] <%Agami23> it could be worse. they could have made the ending a DLC like kingdom hearts 3
[3:02:08] <RushUnplugged> it's almost as if EA got involved with both
[3:02:08] <$RealThiele> Visceral and Bioware consumed
[3:02:09] <+Pequod1> "this building" arent thry all the same lol
[3:02:09] <dalish2k> god i miss dead space
[3:02:12] <iosephe> EA sure is consistent
[3:02:12] <+megaman_sentinel> yea they both die at 3
[3:02:13] <%aWanderingKaivo> the three stages of grief
[3:02:14] <DSD24> Dead Space 3 was pretty bad gameplay wise though
[3:02:15] <+senfood> Fuck EA
[3:02:15] <%dekkitout> They follow the path of trilogies
[3:02:18] <Profmcstevie> They have a method of killing a series, it's very obvious
[3:02:21] <karovus> oh no its true
[3:02:23] <Garry_Guyface> What was Dead Space: Andromeda?
[3:02:25] <Pookiedaexzile> 2 is the best and the begining of the end
[3:02:25] <ScreamLord> 1st game good, 2nd game great, 3rd game fucked
[3:02:28] <peachy996> So identical that after ME3 I took a look at Dead Space 3 and went "they're going to ruin it" and avoided it like the plague
[3:02:30] <%barrakuta371> They're both owned by EA, so it makes sense
[3:02:30] <%Varlinator> They both got EA'd yeah
[3:02:33] <nuane> oh god youre right, I feel like my mind expanded hearing that
[3:02:34] <%NateyBeak> dead space 2 to 3 good to bad gap is WAAAY bigger though
[3:02:34] <awalbaru> Much true
[3:02:37] <$Ziegsy> I remembered wesley snipes CGI eyes today and I cursed pats name
[3:02:39] <jorniev> DEAD SPACE DIED THE WORST WAY IN A DLC UBER FUCKED ENDING
[3:02:39] <@PlagueOfGripes> 1) Would you rather they keep making Dead Space but like Dead Space 3, over and over 2) Would you rather Dead Space 3 had never happened but the series was totally dead
[3:02:39] <peachy996> And I was right
[3:02:40] <ChaosedStar> The fated bad 3rd entry is a common thing in media.
[3:02:45] <%W1nterTitan> THAT"S why 3 feels weird
[3:02:45] <Reverend_Godshyne> Is Dead Space 3 fun to play like Mass Effect 3 though?
[3:02:48] <%Order_of_Mystery> me3 >>>> ds3 tho
[3:02:48] <sky_lives_> me3 has the best gunplay imo
[3:02:49] <%valriot> ME3 isnt nearly as rough as Dead Space 3
[3:02:50] <%Agami23> wasent the real ending to deadspace a DLC for 3?
[3:02:55] <meteor530> I still like Dead SPace 1 more
[3:02:58] <%saadi90> And bad multiplayer
[3:02:59] <DSD24> The suits were so cool in Dead Space 2
[3:03:03] <tigo0donnell> Pinnacle Station was terrible, it focused solely on the one thing that was one of the weakest parts of the game. Combat.
[3:03:05] <peachy996> I would rather DS3 never happen and Dead Space just ended with 2
[3:03:07] <SaphronBlackbourne> I think both 3s are good tbh
[3:03:08] <fugly_nick> Dead Space 3 is only worth playing on Co op
[3:03:08] <akitanito> lol
[3:03:09] <DSD24> Oh yes it does
[3:03:11] <%LumberjackJack> D:
[3:03:12] <karovus> SHOOT HIM
[3:03:12] <Garry_Guyface> But what was the Andromeda of Dead Space, or is that something to fear in the future

[3:03:39] <ioci2112> I mean, citadel dlc confirms the council knew the reapers were coming and tried to prepare, like the turians increased their ship crews, the salarians built stealth dreadnoughts, but it wasn't enough... it's like france and britain in ww2, they thought they had more time, and then space hitler ate their face

[3:04:18] <tigo0donnell> You can make peace with him
[3:04:19] <%emperordread> His name was Robert Paulson
[3:04:19] <Pookiedaexzile> YEAH FUCK EM
[3:04:23] <Samurai_Tchan> delanynder is racist
[3:04:24] <PirateMike_> Honestly both miranda

[3:04:26] <awalbaru> Yep, he can show in 2 and 3
[3:04:30] <%Varlinator> Yes
[3:04:31] <%Rumbutt> Fucker's dropping a rock on an inhabited planet, fuck on sight that fucker
[3:04:31] <+Punchasaur> Holy christ the timing on that
[3:04:31] <CosmicApe13> Only good Batarian is a dead Batarian I'm right there with you pat
[3:04:33] <peachy996> Yeah if you don't kill Balak in this, he'll show up in 3
[3:04:37] <ioci2112> it's not a hate crime if you had fun doing it
[3:04:40] <%warpath1911> Balak will show up in 3
[3:04:41] <tanarath> YEAH, and Balak ties into Arrival @patstaresat
[3:04:42] <tigo0donnell> I didn’t even know you could shoot him tbh, I always talked to him
[3:04:43] <theshillman> Pat "No Human, No rights" Boivin, the infamous human supremacist
[3:04:44] <%Garthunox> im really surprised that Dead Space never got a ps4/xbone port
[3:04:46] <%Monkeyweed21> RACIST PAT
[3:04:47] <James_Quivers> You get to double embarass him when you do so it's worth it
[3:04:55] <%NateyBeak> my stream audio is goofing, the music is getting all worbly it sounds like a shitpost and im giggling
[3:05:02] <%Order_of_Mystery> he *can*, so he won't ;P
[3:05:02] <ScreamLord> Batarians look like reject Lilo & Stitch aliens
[3:05:04] <DSD24> Isn't the Dead Space dev dead
[3:05:09] <Profmcstevie> We do not negotiate with fuckers
[3:05:14] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun2 tansy5Tuntun2 tansy5Tuntun2
[3:05:15] <awalbaru> You fractured the timeline man
[3:05:16] <James_Quivers> BASED
[3:05:18] <peachy996> Yah okay Ashley
[3:05:20] <akitanito> you saw health bar and shot
[3:05:21] <aiutare47> which is the correct response
[3:05:26] <AngryAsian5> You feared for your safety :)
[3:05:27] <ne0bunny> thats very Ashley of you Pat
[3:05:28] <RedPlasticCup> way to go Ash
[3:05:28] <+D00msDayDan> shouldn't have pulled a gun on a spectre
[3:05:28] <%mikeriffic> The only good batarian is a dead batarian am i right
[3:05:30] <%Monkeyweed21> RACIST PAT CONFIRMED
[3:05:30] <Minorou> showing your true colors as a space racist
[3:05:30] <CosmicApe13> Batarians are all homicidal maniacs you chose right pat lol
[3:05:32] <peachy996> I'm sure Ashley didn't think either when she shoots Wrex
[3:05:37] <aiutare47> YOU CANT BE RACIST AGAINST A RACE THAT IS ACTUALLY BAD
[3:05:38] <%jillpilled> He was coming right for you!
[3:05:41] <$RealThiele> pat and ashley sittin in a tree
[3:05:42] <peachy996> So did Wrex, Ashley
[3:05:49] <nuane> Shepard feared for his life
[3:05:50] <$lumporr> stand your ground, eh pat?
[3:05:50] <Pookiedaexzile> He was space resisting
[3:05:51] <ScreamLord> Batarians are like Dark Eldar. There is a 99.9% chance they deserved to die
[3:05:55] <+qanonisadeathcult> alien lives matter pat
[3:05:55] <%mikeriffic> @PatStaresAt they litarally called out to you asking for no violence
[3:05:56] <%MidnightBurst12> as you should
[3:05:57] <%rockcentuar> you want balack to show up he has alot of cool info
[3:06:00] <%skeleklng> Based and Redpilled Ashley would probably defend the Batarians
[3:06:01] <Essixian> @stantheman_97 It's the problem where if you remove uniqueness to broaden appeal you alienate existing fans, and anyone you're trying to appeal to is already getting all the generic gameplay they want somewhere else. It's why "COD-ifying" games never worked. ME2 and DS2 worked out because the devs were good enough and the suits didn't push them to go overboard, but that's a rarity.
[3:06:02] <ioci2112> sprinkle some space crack on him and get out, like a good space cop
[3:06:06] <rekinom> If he didnt want to be shot he shouldnt have been dressed like that
[3:06:09] <%Dakuu75> daaaaaaamn lol
[3:06:13] <+Punchasaur> I FEEL THREATENED
[3:06:24] <notsoy> I FEARED FOR MY LIFE
[3:06:25] <$lumporr> space pig
[3:06:25] <%MidnightBurst12> you feared for your life
[3:06:29] <Pookiedaexzile> I mean If there was a fighting force armed you'd be in the right to kill them in the engagement already started
[3:06:30] <$lumporr> fuck 12000
[3:06:31] <$homelesstwinky> Is it a slur to call Batarians "four eyes"?
[3:06:31] <stantheman_97> kill the batarian women, and the batarian children too
[3:06:31] <$Faustgesicht> Shoulda had only two eyes
[3:06:33] <DSD24> Just the one though
[3:06:35] <Pookiedaexzile> But also fuckem
[3:06:36] <akitanito> the set that matters
[3:06:37] <rekinom> I'm a space cop it doesn't matter
[3:06:38] <peachy996> This is classic 07 DLC spice: Make the turrets move
[3:06:38] <thevoiceofcheese> They were coming right for you
[3:06:39] <%LumberjackJack> Pat, your racism is showing
[3:06:39] <%emperordread> "He's comin right for us"
[3:06:41] <%Monkeyweed21> You and Ashley belong together Pat
[3:06:42] <%Garthunox> i wanna make a joke but it might be too far
[3:06:42] <karovus> im sure that batarian did a crime and therefore deserved it
[3:06:44] <Vantesla> There are good Batarians if one checks lore. Also the main Batarian worlds kicked the pirates/insane out who are usually the ones you meet.
[3:06:47] <$Ziegsy> That wasnt murderous intent, that was glaucoma
[3:06:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> Batarians deserve it. They think no one else has souls because we don't have enough eyes on the outside.
[3:06:49] <%afronooch> who?
[3:06:49] <ape_hawk> he was running with a tv
[3:06:50] <%BigCoffee> who?
[3:06:51] <tanarath> Pat going full space cop
[3:06:52] <+MightyDuckShoes> That Batarians is digging his dick out!!
[3:06:54] <%dekkitout> Who?
[3:06:55] <CSeriesJTYPE> whats castlevania
[3:06:55] <RetributionP> Shepard is a cop basicly anyway. so even if he was racist he won't get any repercussions about it. Kappa
[3:06:57] <Minorou> steve lichman?
[3:06:58] <%Puhff> womst?
[3:06:59] <Garry_Guyface> My body camera was glitching because of the mass effect field of my gun and that's why there's no footage

[3:07:19] <%Monkeyweed21> you said Ligman
[3:07:19] <%Maids4lyfe> Steve Lichman is great
[3:07:20] <huskarl_zap> lickman these gnuts
[3:07:20] <ScreamLord> Charn is on this rock because he was looking for slaves. Fuck 'im
[3:07:20] <FirewallStorm> when you see some Batarian dissing your fly girl give him one of these
[3:07:20] <Essixian> @Vantesla *North Korea
[3:07:20] <%ItalianWaifu> death's dialouge made me want to vomit

[3:07:30] <%aWanderingKaivo> Peace was never an option
[3:07:33] <@PlagueOfGripes> FlysEyes fucking rules. Eat your blackberry
[3:07:33] <%Maids4lyfe> YOU PRONOUNCE THE CH A CHA SOUND
[3:07:34] <+senfood> Steve Lichman, voiced by Malcolm Fucking McDowell
[3:07:36] <fritz_dacat> Nah death stole the show
[3:07:36] <+MightyDuckShoes> who?
[3:07:37] <%MidnightBurst12> he did?
[3:07:39] <fugly_nick> I think that's later
[3:07:42] <%skeleklng> @PatStaresAt "You see Shepard, the shape of the Batarian skull is a sign of...."
[3:07:44] <%NocturneNovember> Oh yeah, I got the Colossus X armor from this mission!
[3:07:46] <TungstenViper> oh you mean Compton Death?
[3:07:47] <Samurai_Tchan> licker
[3:07:47] <aiutare47> @Vantesla the Hegemony believes that slavery is sweet then screams racism whenever a non-batarian says slavery is wrong
[3:07:48] <%NateyBeak> tachyon these nuts
[3:07:49] <theincrediblerick> im glad pat is embracing the bald with character creators
[3:07:49] <ioci2112> be batarian, do space crime
[3:07:49] <Vantesla> @essixian They at least have a good excuse. The leaders for centuries have been indoctrinated.
[3:07:50] <akitanito> woke up to batarian genocide
[3:07:52] <RaidenRising> death was like a 360 multi kid
[3:07:55] <Virokwet> you really did pat
[3:08:00] <%aWanderingKaivo> really racking up those double kills now
[3:08:02] <peachy996> Oh don't get it twisted, they are still scum you just didn't have to kill a few of them
[3:08:03] <Samurai_Tchan> i remember this too
[3:08:04] <tigo0donnell> @essixian Funnily enough, you could argue while not to a great extent, 2 does the same. It simplifies a lot of the RPG mechanics, has less exploration, less weapons, the removal of mods, and decreased armor sets, though you get pieces more often. I hear quite a few people say 1 is the best cause it feels the most like an RPG.
[3:08:09] <$lumporr> jesus pat is a murdering machine
[3:08:13] <aiutare47> Batarian society is built on the enslavement of other races
[3:08:14] <Samurai_Tchan> terroristos
[3:08:16] <$lumporr> SHOOT EM
[3:08:22] <%Dfreddy8> "safe"
[3:08:25] <Essixian> @Vantesla Eh, I wouldn't say there's ever a good excuse to be an authoritarian tyrant.
[3:08:26] <Vantesla> @aiutare47 Just remember they been brainwashed.
[3:08:37] <$Faustgesicht> and slavers
[3:08:39] <$hattrick61> abab
[3:08:44] <%emperordread> The ones you shot were trying to stop the genocide AND terrorism
[3:08:47] <Minorou> that guy you shot was literally gonna say "we don't like what the leader's doing"
[3:08:49] <karovus> they are actively trying to destroy a planet
[3:08:50] <Pookiedaexzile> No Slavers
[3:08:50] <+alphonseisbest> Christ that Shotty sounds incredible!
[3:08:52] <James_Quivers> In three games, they have NEVER shown a good guy Batarian, it's just what theya re
[3:08:53] <$Ziegsy> Thank you for commiting genocode pat, we understand it was in our best interest
[3:08:59] <@PlagueOfGripes> Did you know Batarians own 80% of all interstellar corporations and are responsible for -
[3:08:59] <peachy996> No they weren't
[3:08:59] <%warpath1911> I know we dont negotiate but damn we dont even talk to them?!
[3:09:01] <ape_hawk> no, but they probably had families
[3:09:02] <%NateyBeak> and they make dogs bite people >:V rude
[3:09:07] <Pookiedaexzile> I shouldn't have to say this but ASAB
[3:09:10] <JetpackMcQuack> That's what they all say
[3:09:12] <peachy996> They just wanted out of the crazy bullshit Balak got them into
[3:09:13] <dd44dostivei> but they were still slavers!
[3:09:13] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Batarians have only 2 modus operandi. Enslave or Kill.
[3:09:13] <aiutare47> Like not even hyperbolic or technical slavery, their entire society is built on actual slaves
[3:09:13] <%jillpilled> Mean they're sending an asteroid to kill millions of people LUL
[3:09:14] <SaltyAzteca> dont worry, Shepat will stop it
[3:09:16] <Profmcstevie> ....eh they were probably lying
[3:09:17] <$lumporr> they shoulda stopped it earlier
[3:09:19] <karovus> if they wanna stop terrorism why are they batarian?
[3:09:20] <Minorou> how's the good internets, Plague?
[3:09:20] <SaltyAzteca> with VIOLENCE
[3:09:21] <peachy996> That's not the same as trying to stop
[3:09:21] <+Punchasaur> This would be a cool pvp area
[3:09:23] <$RealThiele> big hero
[3:09:25] <%CalderGaming> PLAGUE NO
[3:09:26] <Essixian> @tigo0donnell I actually like ME2 more because of that. It does have less weapons but most of the ones in ME1 are just recolors with stat variations anyway. I'll take uniqueness over quantity anyday.
[3:09:26] <ape_hawk> hey balsack
[3:09:31] <Vantesla> @essixian You realize indoctrination means they have no free will/control of their actions right. Kinda unfair to blame victims of the Reapers.
[3:09:34] <%chance_h> Honest mistake to be fair
[3:09:34] <akitanito> why can't you just shoot him
[3:09:37] <$lumporr> SHOOT
[3:09:38] <@PlagueOfGripes> Batarians looks like if a vagina was a spider that wish it was a dick
[3:09:39] <DSD24> Man that armor looks good on Pat
[3:09:40] <mikesumusprime> so Pat will save scum to punch a reporter but not to stop terrorism...
[3:09:40] <%aWanderingKaivo> that's NOT as great a line
[3:09:41] <%skeleklng> Did you know that despite making up only 14% of the universe that Batarians commit more than 50% of space crimes
[3:09:42] <Garry_Guyface> Bioware: Mass Effect is a deeply designed RPG with tough moral choices. Also Bioware: [makes 2 races of all evil people, 4 eyes and the rat-men of 2]
[3:09:43] <%JamesCorck> JamesCorck subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Yo Pat, I'll be catching the VoD when it comes out. I'm spending the Friday with my best bud, checking out Yakuza 0, Mass Effect LE, and Disco Elysium. Nothing but good games today! Have fun with the game and a wonderful weekend, man <3
[3:09:50] <peachy996> "Oh hey nice armor" "Thanks you too"
[3:09:52] <%aWanderingKaivo> went from a great line to a super cliche one
[3:09:58] <akitanito> really
[3:10:09] <Essixian> @Vantesla Oh, if it's Reaper indoctrination then yeah.
[3:10:21] <Wolfstriker121> BUT THAT dont mean you can go crazy at society lol
[3:10:21] <James_Quivers> COULD HAVE
[3:10:23] <Dunmarkh> "could have" fuck off
[3:10:25] <TungstenViper> LOGIC
[3:10:25] <ioci2112> the batarians tried to colonize some systems, then the humans showed up and were way better at it, and batarians are still buttmad to this day
[3:10:27] <SaltyAzteca> COULDA WOULDA SHOULDA
[3:10:27] <+senfood> Could have, should have.
[3:10:27] <$RealThiele> hooo boy
[3:10:28] <aiutare47> The hegemony chose Exile themseves
[3:10:28] <Pookiedaexzile> "COULD HAVE BEEN
[3:10:30] <+JaseAdrift> Finders keepers fucker
[3:10:31] <JetpackMcQuack> I'm sorry, we out of planets?
[3:10:36] <AngryAsian5> Snooze ya lose
[3:10:39] <$homelesstwinky> "could have" "should have" lmao
[3:10:39] <$lumporr> THAT COULDA BEEN MY ICE CREAM HOW DARE YOU EAT IT
[3:10:39] <%Varlinator> Ya snooze ya loose Ballsack
[3:10:40] <@PlagueOfGripes> "We were thinking about buying that house! After they bought it!"
[3:10:42] <Pookiedaexzile> SHITTING ON EM
[3:10:43] <akitanito> what kind of shitty logic is this
[3:10:45] <ScreamLord> "You wouldn't let us enslave your colonies and took worlds we didn't even put a claim on. You're the worst."
[3:10:48] <tigo0donnell> @essixian That’s fair, I do like how they did change that a bit in LE, where some weapons actually act differently in ME1.
[3:10:50] <Profmcstevie> STAY IN LOSERS BRACKET BALAK
[3:10:53] <DSD24> Yeah you do though
[3:10:53] <%mikeriffic> its also cus your race is a bunch of slaveing assholes and has a facist government
[3:10:55] <%skeleklng> MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A BATARIAN
[3:10:55] <Broken_Sonex> YEAH YEAH, COULDA WOULDA SHOULDA, KILL THEM ALL
[3:11:00] <James_Quivers> He's just pissed they were beaten  to the punch getting to an unclaimed world, what assholes
[3:11:00] <+senfood> [Glass him]
[3:11:01] <%mikeriffic> that might be why the council doesnt sidw with you
[3:11:03] <$RealThiele> that statement is always wrong
[3:11:04] <aiutare47> Their own government chose to cut themselves off from the galaxy in protest instead of doing literally ANYTHING else
[3:11:04] <+JaseAdrift> You had options though
[3:11:05] <karovus> maybe you shouldve actually colonized the planet then
[3:11:07] <jorniev> YEAH BY PROTESTING
[3:11:07] <JetpackMcQuack> So I destroyed the planet
[3:11:09] <%Garthunox> Balak has real scrubquotes energy
[3:11:13] <Samurai_Tchan> YOu guys have 4 eyes GUILTY
[3:11:19] <DatAsuna> If you're a colonist, they murdered your whole family too
[3:11:20] <fugly_nick> Those 2 dialogue options were exactly the same
[3:11:21] <%Dfreddy8> ROASTED
[3:11:22] <Vantesla> @essixian That's what I prior said. sorry if spoiler. ME3 pretty much explains the Hegime has been indoctrinated for a long time. From finding a dead reaper centuries ago.
[3:11:23] <%justcallmebobplease> Balak IS Scrubquotes!
[3:11:23] <nuane> You don
[3:11:24] <Samurai_Tchan> HAVE AT YOU
[3:11:24] <%BigCoffee> Man batarians suck
[3:11:25] <$lumporr> "s-shut up!"
[3:11:25] <%zyberion626> we can argue about the Turian Hierarchy but the Batarians are LITERALLY fascist
[3:11:25] <James_Quivers> I'M THE VICTIM HERE
[3:11:26] <aiutare47> An entire race of scrubs
[3:11:27] <JetpackMcQuack> hoes mad
[3:11:28] <Essixian> "STOP TELLING ME I'M WRONG"
[3:11:29] <ioci2112> SHOOT THE FUCK
[3:11:31] <nuane> You don't GET it man
[3:11:33] <DSD24> No kill him
[3:11:33] <Samurai_Tchan> DIE MOSTER
[3:11:34] <RedPlasticCup> It's funnier to let him go
[3:11:35] <ScreamLord> How dare you stop us from enslaving your people and genocide planets.
[3:11:38] <@PlagueOfGripes> Sounds like Batarians didn't plan well, got their assholes blown open from not being prepared and now are throwing a tantrum
[3:11:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Fuck you 4 eyes
[3:11:43] <$dalmek> YOU INTERFERE MY BUSINESS

[3:21:25] <peachy996> Does anyone know if Pat bought a license from Opold in Noveria?
[3:21:28] <DSD24> @Profmcstevie They made Dragon Age Origins and that's a great game
[3:21:31] <%Agami23> time for her student to steal her name in another universe.
[3:21:46] <%AzureGale> Cannon armor?
[3:21:48] <peachy996> Yeah it looks cool
[3:21:52] <%jillpilled> But fashion-souls tho
[3:21:55] <CosmicApe13> I wish Wrex was a companion in 2 &3
[3:21:55] <fugly_nick> I thought Wrex wore red in ME2 and 3
[3:22:04] <peachy996> Ok so good chance it was Elkoss
[3:22:05] <%aWanderingKaivo> red in 3
[3:22:11] <James_Quivers> @fugly_nick Only in 3
[3:22:16] <%Order_of_Mystery> @patstaresat from the wiki: "A license to sell Geth Armory products is available from Morlan, a salarian merchant located in the Lower Markets of the Citadel Wards."
[3:22:17] <DSD24> I wish we had a Krogan teammate in ME3
[3:22:22] <%LumberjackJack> Opold and the volus merchant in the market wards sells the Elkoss license
[3:22:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Cannon as in he did a story mission for it
[3:22:23] <T_Sasquatch> I just realized Scarlet Nexus released last week
[3:22:26] <%afronooch> balance out for the long one the other day
[3:22:38] <tigo0donnell> @profmcstevie Yeah, they did, just they sometimes have oversights. Tbf Mass Effect was super ambitious for the time so I can forgive some of its oversights
[3:22:44] <@PlagueOfGripes> It's been a busy day
[3:22:46] <DSD24> @T_Sasquatch Wait it did?
[3:22:55] <%BigCoffee> @T_Sasquatch the full game?
[3:23:01] <@PlagueOfGripes> this man has a very froggy mouth
[3:23:09] <Vantesla> probably good to check the stock given it's probably changes/updated. Might get lucky and see a Savant X amp.
[3:23:09] <%Dfreddy8> Illos is endgame basically
[3:23:13] <intestinal_bleeding> w-what

[3:23:27] <intestinal_bleeding> yeah there's a lot
[3:23:29] <jorniev> which one?
[3:23:32] <%walternatorz> Did you download a brain virus?
[3:23:33] <tigo0donnell> I do like the ME1 recalibrated mod that only has Virmire unlocked after the first two are done, makes it have more weight and feel like endgame
[3:23:33] <@PlagueOfGripes> don't engage with him
[3:23:34] <+yoshkosh20> @T_Sasquatch thought it came out on the 24th, that only for pc?

[3:28:50] <tigo0donnell> That’s one of the things they should’ve improved in terms of the inventories and markets
[3:28:51] <jackelzxaa> Opold is on noveria
[3:28:56] <+senfood> @PlagueOfGripes Good. I've always wanted to date a Hanar.
[3:28:57] <%aWanderingKaivo> former Pat

[3:31:22] <stantheman_97> personal experience?
[3:31:23] <peachy996> Oh he's the Elcor in Peak 15
[3:31:25] <+yoshkosh20> @ItalianWaifu they never take the L, they call corperate or the manager.
[3:31:26] <$Ziegsy> H- Has he spoken to sukon?

[3:31:48] <%Varlinator> Did you get Serrice?
[3:31:49] <jackelzxaa> Theres a salarian on feros, an elcor at peak 15, a hanar at port hanchan…
[3:32:00] <jackelzxaa> I dont think you can return to peak 15 tho
[3:32:06] <%Agami23> they were made in a lab by disney.
[3:32:07] <%Monkeyweed21> pat no
[3:32:08] <%AzureGale> They split up a long time ago
[3:32:10] <Pookiedaexzile> That Turian knows he bought that item from there, that isn't some corporate store, its a merchant
[3:32:11] <%BigCoffee> the jonas brothers where a thing qwhen you where in high school Pat
[3:32:13] <aiutare47> Triple Q does that a lot though
[3:32:16] <fairore> wow par

[3:32:26] <@PlagueOfGripes> It was a shame that they had to eat one of the brothers after that accident
[3:32:28] <%walternatorz> Mr. Evrart is helping me find my gun.
[3:32:28] <jackelzxaa> I dont know if that elcor has a liscense but hes the only elcor merchant in 1 i can think of
[3:32:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> pat slow down
[3:32:34] <%warpath1911> This is peak mass effect right here!
[3:32:38] <%chance_h> Yes commander
[3:32:44] <s3tok41b4> I'm bout to head out "yes commander"
[3:32:46] <fritz_dacat> Didn’t they push purity rings. Or was that south park thing.
[3:32:47] <$Ziegsy> @dirtyh4rr1 thank you so much.
[3:32:47] <conchthechimera> @PlagueOfGripes Only the fittest can survive
[3:32:48] <%Dfreddy8> Csec guy?
[3:32:51] <jackelzxaa> You can hold the stick before you mash in the top left direction
[3:33:07] <+Lulu19> me and the boys
[3:33:11] <jackelzxaa> Talk to your normandy man and see if you can but anything you’d ever want
[3:33:13] <%Monkeyweed21> @fritz_dacat purity rings were a real thing South Park was making fun of
[3:33:14] <peachy996> A Rye
[3:33:15] <JetpackMcQuack> oh nooooo
[3:33:18] <jackelzxaa> *buy
[3:33:38] <tanarath> They fingered analeis for it, nice
[3:33:39] <tigo0donnell> ME RECAP RADIOIOOO
[3:33:40] <Corgifist> If you already got the Kassa Fabrications license, it's okay if you didn't talk to the Elcor merchant in Peak 15
[3:33:46] <conchthechimera> I wonder if you have Wrex and Garrus as teammates long enough in those elevators you can tell who ripped ass
[3:33:46] <peachy996> eugh
[3:33:47] <jackelzxaa> Remember when me3 actually pays off doing the stupid collect shit quests from me1 in a weird way
[3:33:47] <aiutare47> ME1 is a lot shorter than 2008 me remembers
[3:33:55] <+Punchasaur> Poor analingus
[3:33:58] <%Dfreddy8> So we are finishing tonight?
[3:34:02] <%ItalianWaifu> do here head tenticle wiggle when she gets aroused like a weird Futurama bit
[3:34:04] <intestinal_bleeding> yeah me1 felt like an eternity
[3:34:10] <intestinal_bleeding> even without the side stuff
[3:34:12] <%aWanderingKaivo> I can no longer tell if the panting is Shepard or Pat making fun of Shepard
[3:34:12] <%Monkeyweed21> remember to have the sex on top of Ashley's coffin @PatStaresAt
[3:34:13] <jackelzxaa> Pat wont do it but ashley has a unique reaction with the racist you find on the citadel in the wards
[3:34:16] <%BigCoffee> @aiutare47 Pat's already like 24 hours in
[3:34:19] <peachy996> Talk to the PennyExpert
[3:34:26] <$Ziegsy> What does presley do if shephards away and he needs to pee? Like.. there must be an officer on the bridge at all times, right?
[3:34:27] <jackelzxaa> Is pat gonna blow up ashley
[3:34:30] <aiutare47> is it really only 4 1/2 worlds though?
[3:34:32] <peachy996> The NickelPro
[3:34:34] <Corgifist> @aiutare47 Yeah, especially if you don't do the side stuff
[3:34:35] <%warpath1911> @jackelzxaa Really!?
[3:34:35] <intestinal_bleeding> OW
[3:34:36] <fugly_nick> ME1 was the shortest for me, but I didn't do all the uncharted planet exploration
[3:34:38] <ChaosedStar> better load times help a lot methinks on how fast the game feels
[3:34:42] <intestinal_bleeding> pat is a mean person and he hates garrus confirmed
[3:34:50] <peachy996> Thank me how?
[3:34:50] <conchthechimera> I dOn'T hAvE tImE fOr ThIs
[3:34:52] <jackelzxaa> Yeah ashley bitches out the terra firma guy
[3:34:54] <%Agami23> i dont know why a human just talking to someone in sci-fi and going "your store is shit hooman!"
[3:34:59] <jackelzxaa> She calls him a racist
[3:35:00] <peachy996> In what position?
[3:35:04] <jackelzxaa> Hug garrus
[3:35:14] <@PlagueOfGripes> What do you think happens to the toilet waste on board the Normandy? I imagine all that alien doodie combining with human poopie is a rough combination for any recycling system to take. Maybe it shoots out into space, like a fish taking a stringy dump
[3:35:14] <tigo0donnell> @aiutare47 Yeah if you don’t do the side content it’s not a long game at all. Even then I think my longest play through was 30 hours with 100% completion.
[3:35:17] <jackelzxaa> Garrus learned
[3:35:21] <+senfood> YOU CHANGED HIM
[3:35:21] <+Photonicfab> No cat-bird-lizard-man has any right to be as sexy as Garrus is
[3:35:22] <ape_hawk> now suck his dick, pat
[3:35:30] <jackelzxaa> They space the dookie
[3:35:31] <peachy996> God you're hot I mean....you're welcome
[3:35:39] <+pally_din> Garrus' bloodlust is sated... for now
[3:35:39] <%valriot> He doesnt give up on it tbh
[3:35:40] <conchthechimera> Goddamn it Plague LUL
[3:35:43] <%wibbwobbler> Garrus
[3:35:43] <jorniev> Jesus doc is so right
[3:35:44] <asylumkon> i wonder if shepard will keep that in mind in ME3
[3:35:49] <jackelzxaa> If you just do main planets me1 is 17 hours
[3:35:54] <intestinal_bleeding> hey lois, this one time ehehehhe
[3:35:56] <Pookiedaexzile> He instantly gives up on it in 2
[3:35:59] <+RAWPowerStudios> Oh are we doing a Cando right now?
[3:36:01] <$Ziegsy> @PlagueOfGripes Considering some alien fluids are toxic to humans fluids, the mix would be a noxious poisonous chemical mess
[3:36:03] <Corgifist> @jorniev no
[3:36:04] <aiutare47> I remember this game as a long sprawling epic, but that was like 12 years ago
[3:36:05] <ChaosedStar> Wrex eats all the normandys poopies.
[3:36:05] <@PlagueOfGripes> Garrus would never be unstable. Nice, pillar of strength Garrus
[3:36:12] <%ItalianWaifu> @PlagueOfGripes they use mass effect fields on the sceptic tanks so its fine
[3:36:13] <jackelzxaa> Me3 garrus is a giga bro
[3:36:13] <Pookiedaexzile> You find him being the Punisher
[3:36:13] <ape_hawk> POLITICIANS ARE CORRUPT, ESPECIALLY IN THE FUTURE
[3:36:13] <%zyberion626> oh I love this story!
[3:36:17] <%GalacticaPhanto> Wait was Wrex complimenting the Volus just now
[3:36:18] <peachy996> Yes nice pillar
[3:36:23] <fugly_nick> Yeah Wrex is the Canderous of this game
[3:36:23] <%BigCoffee> @PlagueOfGripes Plague are you ok
[3:36:27] <peachy996> Hard. Erect. Blue
[3:36:31] <%cvp5127> cvp5127 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! pat how do i lvl up fast in 14? im stuck on operation archon
[3:36:45] <jackelzxaa> Wrex might be the best model in the game now
[3:36:49] <jackelzxaa> “Aleena”
[3:36:58] <conchthechimera> Last ditch effort of the sentient races of the galaxies, we start shooting our collective feces through the relays at the reapers
[3:36:58] <$Ziegsy> Apparently space poop is burned. Weird, I assumed they buried on the moons like cats do
[3:36:58] <%dekkitout> Did you two fight-fuck or fuck-fight?
[3:36:58] <%Monkeyweed21> WREX DOES YOUR PENIS GLOW BLUE TOO?
[3:37:06] <Broken_Sonex> @PlagueOfGripes He hasn't been okay since he learned to draw a butt good
[3:37:09] <conchthechimera> FTL poop cannon
[3:37:11] <Explodincatz> smart
[3:37:26] <jackelzxaa> Is pat gonna finish the mass effect tonight?  Virmire and illos isnt that long
[3:37:27] <ape_hawk> THEN WE FUCKED
[3:37:29] <tanarath> NICE
[3:37:33] <peachy996> You meet Aleena later
[3:37:35] <%Garthunox> what do you mean you're stuck on operation archon?
[3:37:40] <peachy996> Under a different name
[3:37:46] <fugly_nick> I think he's doing Virmire and Illos next session
[3:37:49] <T_Sasquatch> @jackelzxaa no
[3:37:49] <%warpath1911> @peachy996 no you dont
[3:37:49] <jackelzxaa> Ugh i got an ad
[3:37:53] <%cvp5127> fuckfight?
[3:37:53] <jackelzxaa> Ad makes me sad
[3:38:01] <+senfood> This is so romantic.
[3:38:10] <peachy996> @warpath1911 talk to Aria some more
[3:38:13] <+pally_din> But Wrex ammo isn't in Mass Effect 1
[3:38:16] <%BigCoffee> Ok now kiss
[3:38:20] <jorniev> Jeez like a war
[3:38:22] <jackelzxaa> Imagine if pinnacle station was still in
[3:38:22] <+CherteuseKapibara> battle fuck
[3:38:30] <conchthechimera> You mean "heat sinks"
[3:38:35] <%BigCoffee> @pally_din means he used every weapon's metal core up
[3:38:35] <@PlagueOfGripes> War Bang
[3:38:35] <%warpath1911> @peachy996 the devs confirmed that aleena isnt aria
[3:38:36] <tanarath> @pally_din it kinda is, technically
[3:38:37] <+D00msDayDan> they fought for so long they ran out of ammo on their fuckin future guns with theoretically infinite ammo
[3:38:39] <%MugenSandan> I wanna mention that Mass Effect 2 makes this story less cool
[3:38:39] <dd44dostivei> @jackelzxaa why
[3:38:41] <%zyberion626> fucking. legend.
[3:38:45] <$Ziegsy> Not the left one. that shits huge
[3:38:48] <%valriot> LUL
[3:38:49] <thevoiceofcheese> warpugHeck
[3:38:52] <Rei_Dsoto> Whoof.
[3:38:52] <tigo0donnell> @pookiedaexzile I wouldn’t say he outright goes back on his word, he mentions to Shepard that he in no way endangers civilians as Archangel. Mainly from the Council breaking up the team, and everything about Sovereign being covered up, he leaves. He is a bit ruthless but that’s more out of vengeance and his regrets, plus Omega didn’t really have any law at all. He even says out of all the work he did he hardly put a dent into it
[3:38:55] <James_Quivers> That's Paiges favorite nut
[3:38:55] <intestinal_bleeding> heheheheh
[3:38:56] <peachy996> Hm, fair enough
[3:39:12] <%MidnightBurst12> the good nut
[3:39:16] <jackelzxaa> Better luck next time  ;-)
[3:39:26] <iosephe> LUL
[3:39:29] <@PlagueOfGripes> life hustle
[3:39:32] <%Mr_Pylon> that's a good hustle
[3:39:44] <jackelzxaa> @dd44dostivei Pinnacle station is a nightmare for most players to do a 100% run
[3:39:45] <$Ziegsy> ziegsyEyes natural causes...
[3:39:49] <%logoth_> Wrex

[3:40:05] <Pookiedaexzile> @tigo0donnell Yeah no, dude its the complete opposite of " I will follow the rule of law" I played it
[3:40:09] <+CookieCutter007> DANGEROUS
[3:40:11] <@PlagueOfGripes> Wrex is like if space was a dog
[3:40:17] <Ultimatefool> Bye Ashley

[3:40:36] <jackelzxaa> Wrex garrus and tali kind of futz with the dialog rules
[3:40:37] <DSD24> Ashley is cool sometimes
[3:40:38] <%MugenSandan> psaBig SOON
[3:40:39] <xxshadowxx416> is Ashley going to die
[3:40:40] <+alphonseisbest> wow, whats even the point if your not gonna kill her, why even talk to her?
[3:40:41] <fugly_nick> If space was a dog?
[3:40:44] <%Mekhet09> did you kill kaiden this time?
[3:40:45] <%EsotericOdyssey> well that's on-the-nose tali
[3:40:45] <%Agami23> i know the krogan have the whole genophage thing going on, but i'd let wrex try repopulating with me after hearing that story
[3:40:46] <%wibbwobbler> psaSkelmo
[3:40:46] <Wolfstriker121> Order 66 on her
[3:40:47] <%Monkeyweed21> STAY STRONG AND BE PATIENT
[3:40:48] <Rei_Dsoto> "We'll bang, okay?"
[3:40:49] <stantheman_97> love you wrex. now let me talk to... ugh
[3:40:49] <%ItalianWaifu> do you think Wrex would get made if you flipped your hand up and down in his mouth like people do to dogs
[3:40:51] <+OmegaWeltall> did he kill kaiden yet?
[3:40:55] <jackelzxaa> “Soon”
[3:40:55] <peachy996> @PlagueOfGripes The aim is to kill her in 3
[3:40:57] <+CursedNobleman> have we done virmire?
[3:40:57] <%zyberion626> @plagueofgripes he hasn't gotten to that part yet
[3:40:59] <stantheman_97> SOON PogChamp
[3:41:09] <tanarath> soon
[3:41:10] <%AzureGale> Tally
[3:41:12] <peachy996> Because it's hilarious to shoot her
[3:41:17] <DatAsuna> nah the post virmire ones actually mention who die
[3:41:17] <tigo0donnell> @pookiedaexzile Didn’t say you didn’t, just the way I see his character arc in the 2nd game, but feel free to disagree
[3:41:29] <ape_hawk> "nah, they treat you like slavers. cuz your slavers.
[3:41:31] <@PlagueOfGripes> Kaiden is better than her. I am not on the fence about it. And Kaiden is a boring motherfucker
[3:41:33] <jackelzxaa> Kaiden is worth keeping for me3.  He has alot of content in 3 and citadel dlc that doesnt require you to bring him on any missions
[3:41:43] <%NopeBadguy> i should go
[3:41:44] <James_Quivers> I'm gonna miss those sweet thighs
[3:41:49] <jackelzxaa> Kaiden gets shit on openly in 3 dlc
[3:41:52] <jackelzxaa> Its great
[3:41:53] <%Monkeyweed21> I'll be here until I'm legal
[3:41:53] <peachy996> Kaiden is never worth keeping
[3:41:54] <%ClericOfSparda> wow
[3:41:57] <ape_hawk> pat, you think theres a Quarian Putin?
[3:41:58] <tanarath> Kaiden might be boring, but that isn't a crime.
[3:42:00] <jackelzxaa> Space canadian
[3:42:08] <Vyskus> join in to hot takes
[3:42:11] <ChaosedStar> Boring > Racist n annoying
[3:42:12] <LluthyY> kaidan is fun in citadel dlc
[3:42:13] <%NopeBadguy> kaiden is better worth keeping than ashley
[3:42:14] <DatAsuna> Kaidan is good fun in 3
[3:42:14] <ape_hawk> because 2007
[3:42:15] <intestinal_bleeding> because he's HANDSOME
[3:42:15] <$SGrim> The kaiden v. ashley debate is easy to summarize. A zero is better than an negative.
[3:42:16] <%dekkitout> For increased sexual tension
[3:42:17] <dd44dostivei> it's so intense
[3:42:18] <jackelzxaa> Kaiden at least knows hes boring by the time we get to 3
[3:42:18] <AngryAsian5> Kaiden's always wiping the sweat off his brow
[3:42:20] <James_Quivers> Being a Canadian is crime enough
[3:42:25] <jackelzxaa> So thats something
[3:42:26] <fugly_nick> I think that animation is meant for femshep
[3:42:28] <%NateyBeak> cuz sexual tension
[3:42:28] <%Varlinator> Because he's always sweaty Pat!
[3:42:29] <RushUnplugged> so you can stare at his sweaty muscles
[3:42:30] <aiutare47> Kaiden gets bullied hard in ME3
[3:42:33] <peachy996> Kaiden will die a hero's death on Virmire, Ashley will get shot in 3 like a punk bitch
[3:42:34] <ape_hawk> 2 hours?
[3:42:37] <$SGrim> 3-4 hours
[3:42:38] <@PlagueOfGripes> Kaidan killed an instructor once, you know. He's deep.
[3:42:39] <%NopeBadguy> maybe like three hours?
[3:42:39] <PanicSwytch> 2 hours
[3:42:39] <Mattais88> DO IT!
[3:42:41] <Thepothero> bout 2 hiurs each
[3:42:42] <RedPlasticCup> not long
[3:42:42] <aiutare47> Only like two hours, no?
[3:42:42] <%jillpilled> Like 3 and a half four hours?
[3:42:42] <DatAsuna> the vitriol towards kaidan is ridiculous. Apathy i understand at least
[3:42:42] <James_Quivers> 2 hours prob
[3:42:43] <%warpath1911> 4 hours minimum
[3:42:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 2-3?
[3:42:44] <%LumberjackJack> Total? 3 - 4 hours
[3:42:45] <jackelzxaa> Kaiden bullies HIMSELF in 3
[3:42:45] <%Monkeyweed21> 4 hours
[3:42:46] <%Order_of_Mystery> 3 hours
[3:42:46] <%knight1210> 3 HOURS
[3:42:47] <%Dfreddy8> 2/2.5
[3:42:47] <+alphonseisbest> 3-4 hours
[3:42:47] <%chance_h> The long stares imply romance
[3:42:47] <conchthechimera> God i'm getting throwbacks to sophomore year of college when I played this on the PS3
[3:42:48] <dd44dostivei> 3 hours?
[3:42:48] <%Garthunox> 3-4 hours
[3:42:48] <%BigCoffee> You know what's funny? Whenever Ashley talks I mute the streams
[3:42:49] <fugly_nick> Virmire is like an hour and a half
[3:42:50] <intestinal_bleeding> it's SEVEN
[3:42:52] <%Varlinator> 4 hours for both
[3:42:52] <James_Quivers> TOTAL YOU SAID
[3:42:53] <Nyterayce> 90 rush
[3:42:56] <%jillpilled> Yeah Vermire's massive
[3:42:56] <ScreamLord> 3-4 hours maybe?
[3:42:57] <jackelzxaa> Virmire and illos are 4 hours
[3:42:59] <%Garthunox> it is!
[3:42:59] <tigo0donnell> 3 hours give or take
[3:43:00] <+pally_din> They mean Virmire + Ilos
[3:43:00] <%AzureGale> A whole ass-planet?
[3:43:01] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Don't forget the Citadel fight.
[3:43:05] <peachy996> Virmire+Ilos is 2-2 and a half
[3:43:06] <%LumberjackJack> Virmire + Ilos endgame is 3 - 4 hours, I'd say
[3:43:09] <%Monkeyweed21> 4 or 5 hours
[3:43:10] <%Retinolgaming> Its like 2 hours for virmire
[3:43:10] <i_chevalier> @plagueofgripes and morale gray
[3:43:11] <%Varlinator> ok 5 hours for both
[3:43:12] <jackelzxaa> Virmire is shorter than you remember
[3:43:12] <Mattais88> Yeah, but it's also a bunch of Mako sections
[3:43:12] <$Ziegsy> So when the scene where shepherd bones joker and shatters him like porcelain?
[3:43:13] <%EsotericOdyssey> virmire could be a short-to-average stream by itself
[3:43:13] <RedPlasticCup> there's no backtracking in virmire
[3:43:14] <peachy996> Ilos is like an hour
[3:43:15] <leinadtonu> so 3 hours?
[3:43:15] <Minorou> save-a-da game
[3:43:16] <jackelzxaa> Theres no town bullshit
[3:43:19] <dd44dostivei> i feel like virmire is shorter than the hub worlds
[3:43:19] <%strakillias> Virmire is hort cause it all killing
[3:43:23] <Basch71> around 3
[3:43:25] <%Garthunox> Pat i bear Noveria, virmire, ilos and the citadel last night during your stream!

[3:43:30] <Profmcstevie> Saturday strim usedO
[3:43:32] <%zyberion626> imagine being European
[3:43:33] <jackelzxaa> Virmire is a drive, a camp, a canyon, a base, and a second base
[3:43:39] <Alzero83> YoYou calling it now?
[3:43:40] <tigo0donnell> Virmire and silos for the most part is a straight shot
[3:43:40] <PanicSwytch> Poop stream
[3:43:42] <conchthechimera> Pat's taking Wrex out for a poopie?
[3:43:50] <xxshadowxx416> yeah e3

[3:44:10] <jorniev> trailer week
[3:44:12] <s3tok41b4> God I'm hoping for Zelda news
[3:44:16] <Basch71> could be slightly longer if you plan to do all the sub missions during virmire
[3:44:18] <%wibbwobbler> E3E3E3
[3:44:19] <Alzero83> Jeezus I love watching pat but these constant breaks
[3:44:24] <peachy996> Let's talk about why Garrus has such wide hips
[3:44:27] <xxshadowxx416> it not live e3 PunOko
[3:44:28] <Profmcstevie> It'll be weird having a podcast during E3 on the 14th
[3:44:32] <jackelzxaa> My favorite kaiden joke has to be in citadel dlc if you just dont bring him on anything
[3:44:36] <$Ziegsy> So anyone get that feeling of being tired but they just DONT WANT to sleep? Is that depression talking?
[3:44:37] <conchthechimera> Because bird person
[3:44:38] <jackelzxaa> He has a special bit
[3:44:43] <Pookiedaexzile> So next week we're gonna get 2 one off streams and then ME2 as it turns out E3 is boring
[3:44:50] <ChaosedStar> @Ziegsy 100% fren
[3:45:00] <jackelzxaa> Kaiden is actually better as dead weight and they know it and lean in
[3:45:02] <i_chevalier> @oldonyx its dying, but still gotta squeeze out all the money left
[3:45:06] <PanicSwytch> I have a love/hate relationship with E3 cuz 95% of the shit they show is either fake gameplay or Games revealed tooo early
[3:45:14] <ChaosedStar> doodSad doodSad doodSad
[3:45:18] <%GalacticaPhanto> @ziegsy it can be, I've been having real bad bouts but I feel ya
[3:45:27] <$Ziegsy> @ChaosedStar awh man. Thank ye.
[3:45:28] <jackelzxaa> God what if pat fucks up and gets someone killed on the suicide mission
[3:45:32] <conchthechimera> At least we get memes with E3
[3:45:35] <peachy996> There's nothing to interest me in 3 anyway
[3:45:42] <conchthechimera> Who can ever forget "it just works"?
[3:45:44] <jackelzxaa> Theres two parts that trip some people up
[3:45:47] <Profmcstevie> E3 is just video game christmas, an agreed upon time to dump new shit out. Whether it's good is another thing entirely
[3:46:00] <tomahank18> Fuck what did I miss
[3:46:04] <peachy996> I think Pat will have read up or distinctly remembers
[3:46:16] <jackelzxaa> What did pat do with balak
[3:46:19] <$Ziegsy> @GalacticaPhanto Its 4am and I just cant bring myself to go to bed yet
[3:46:22] <peachy996> I know everyone will warn him about Mordin
[3:46:22] <%GalacticaPhanto> @tomahank18 the whole thing
[3:46:23] <i_chevalier> @profmcstevie Agreed. not ever Christmas is a good Christmas
[3:46:33] <tomahank18> It’s over? Lol
[3:46:34] <%warpath1911> @jackelzxaa let him go
[3:46:36] <$Ziegsy> @jackelzxaa let him go
[3:46:54] <jackelzxaa> Luna and Bring Down the Sky might be the best unc missions
[3:47:08] <jackelzxaa> Luna has a nice open layout with a cool aesthetic
[3:47:16] <jackelzxaa> No stupid agro crags
[3:47:34] <%warpath1911> @jackelzxaa plus its when you meet EDI
[3:47:35] <Oxybe> doggo walking break?
[3:47:47] <Profmcstevie> Dog emptying break
[3:47:48] <peachy996> I'm partial to Agebinum just for the easy terrain and cool skybox
[3:47:54] <xxshadowxx416> when's e6
[3:47:57] <Oxybe> nice.
[3:48:03] <tomahank18> How far in are we
[3:48:03] <$OranHexthief> theres some wacky rumors floating around about kojima possibly working with microsoft on something and even more wack rumors about microsoft possibly buying some konami IP's sounds too good to be true but also this time last year bethesda was still its own company rooThink
[3:48:03] <peachy996> And getting to run down a hill like a nut
[3:48:08] <Profmcstevie> psaDogchamp I was full and now I am empty
[3:48:32] <peachy996> Oh boy I can't wait for the yearly annual Star Fox and Metroid rumors
[3:48:54] <peachy996> On top of the "Konami isn't shit anymore guys" rumors
[3:49:11] <xxshadowxx416> worst thing about E3 no bo3 news
[3:49:12] <%AzureGale> Can't wait for the next New Switch rumor

[3:56:24] <Samurai_Tchan> I AM UNLUCKY
[3:56:32] <jackelzxaa> The legion thing is real
[3:56:44] <%AzureGale> If you hack Legion to have him earlier he has actual dialogue for missions he wouldn't have been able to go on
[3:56:56] <jackelzxaa> Thats why the original trailer was a geth finding shepard’s corpse
[3:57:02] <jackelzxaa> The early teaser
[3:57:06] <peachy996> Pat check to see if the unfortunate quote "ME3 will be like Return of th Jedi" is buried by history
[3:57:14] <peachy996> That one is my favorite
[3:57:14] <$OranHexthief> you can actually mod the game so you have legion during the jack mission and he has fully voiced dialog still
[3:57:21] <tomahank18> So, did we finish tonight?
[3:57:21] <DatAsuna> citation needed
[3:57:26] <%NateyBeak> theres tons of real dialogue Legion has on missions you cant actually access so, its real
[3:57:30] <jackelzxaa> It might be from an art book
[3:57:35] <%AzureGale> @tomahank18 Yeah
[3:57:44] <tomahank18> Well sheeeet

[3:57:55] <RLT917> LUL
[3:57:59] <$Ziegsy> because of the way dogs reocgnise names, you can call hims 'shortbeef' and hed answer

[3:58:07] <Zalapski> don't let zangief travel back to his home planet!!!

[3:58:47] <ChaosedStar> the snorting or i guess you call breathing is so audible lol
[3:58:48] <JetpackMcQuack> WHERE TREAT
[3:58:51] <%Maids4lyfe> did he learn to eat elmo hair from watching elmo eat his hair?
[3:58:53] <Samurai_Jake> Is Zangief was an elcor it would just be him repeating the sentence: “Hungry; give me more food”
[3:58:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Bitch don't point at me with no food in ya hand
[3:58:59] <%AzureGale> Spin dat hand

[3:59:08] <Ultimatefool> I love when dogs high five
[3:59:09] <%walternatorz> He will bite your hand off one day.
[3:59:10] <%NopeBadguy> please ask him to speak
[3:59:10] <%ItalianWaifu> how many treats are left in that bag it seems infinit
[3:59:25] <$Ziegsy> he doesnt bite the hand that feeds
[3:59:31] <%AzureGale> Gief mark his territory
[3:59:31] <Minorou> making sure you're edible when The Troubles begin
[3:59:32] <%NopeBadguy> he's developing a taste for your flesh
[3:59:32] <+Punchasaur> Put gief's face over wrex's
[3:59:35] <%RetroCop87> either his fur is a bit discolored on his left side, or he has some lint hanging off him
[3:59:36] <%ItalianWaifu> dont eat the hand thats feeds eat the other one
[3:59:37] <peachy996> Cant tell left from right

[3:59:57] <tanarath> God, Gief is such a unit
[3:59:57] <%Maids4lyfe> @PatStaresAt that's because he knows not to bite the hand that feeds him
[4:00:00] <DrStinkers> "I love him", *gutteral belch*
[4:00:06] <%AzureGale> @kortin Yes
[4:00:16] <+fatalguerrero> Hes smart to not bite the hand that feeds him

[4:01:47] <DatAsuna> he means the Eve
[4:01:48] <+Jrockoni> prob edi
[4:01:52] <Profmcstevie> directly in the face
[4:01:57] <DatAsuna> EDI literally can't die until the ending
[4:02:07] <DatAsuna> EDI is one of only 3 squadmates that will always be available
[4:02:16] <notsoy> batarians deserve it tho
[4:02:19] <%AzureGale> Oh no
[4:02:22] <srv4254> is he done for tonight?
[4:02:23] <DatAsuna> EDI, James and Liara are the only mandatory party members
[4:02:24] <@PlagueOfGripes> Jacob can hold a conversation better but has nothing to say
[4:02:27] <aiutare47> Kaiden kills his master in a fit of rage, thats sick

[4:02:40] <Profmcstevie> The definition of edible means nothing

[4:02:45] <PanicSwytch> To Gief...EVERYTHING  is food
