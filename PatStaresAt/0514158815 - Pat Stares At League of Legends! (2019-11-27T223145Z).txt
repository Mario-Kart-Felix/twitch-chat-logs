[0:00:11] <Arnoldoaad1> considering that he played HOTS for a good minute i do think that he will get addicted
[0:00:11] <%WheatlyXT> he's *actually* doing it
[0:00:13] <PunishedMercer_> ahahaha
[0:00:16] <%Tuskor13> What is this timeline
[0:00:19] <+smitty_werb_> new dude needs a pac man level brain to play
[0:00:20] <%vixenpunch> new league is like hots
[0:00:21] <Monkroot> @bakkatohri that was true like 5 years ago too so I'm super scared to see how bad it is now
[0:00:22] <Imsoverylazy> Fun Fact about League of Legends: The League of Legends was retconned out of the lore
[0:00:30] <astreas13> New dude has like 25 skills Jesus Christ.
[0:00:31] <+smitty_werb_> 25(ish) abilities?
[0:00:33] <celesticv> @imsoverylazy only the best know when to strike upon thee ! (duh) :p
[0:00:39] <%vixenpunch> its more like 20
[0:00:46] <%vixenpunch> he has no E
[0:00:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> I suck at league!
[0:00:51] <+smitty_werb_> his ult changes based on the weapons too remember
[0:00:51] <Imsoverylazy> New guy looks so awful can't wait
[0:00:51] <LunarRemix> !uptime
[0:00:52] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 44m.
[0:00:54] <redrins> the retconned the tribunal and a lot of lore, freaking sucks
[0:00:55] <Zteck123> good
[0:01:02] <%vixenpunch> he swaps between 5 guns with one in mainhand another in offhand
[0:01:05] <Dakuu75> League isn't so bad, (if you mute everyone, everytime)
[0:01:08] <%vixenpunch> his ult and his q changes depending
[0:01:12] <BigManLugan> oh we actually going top lane huh?
[0:01:14] <Ser_Ser_Ser> I for one am excited for our sad moon boi
[0:01:17] <%vixenpunch> and each gun has different effects
[0:01:17] <%KevinsLunchbox> what a boomer chat. people are so afraid of a little bit league of legends
[0:01:18] <%Chichen> Chichen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 13 month streak! I can't believe I'm subbed to a DISGUSTING League streamer, UGH. Anyway here's more money for Elmo.
[0:01:18] <Cycrosa> eh the world lore and champ lore is way better now
[0:01:20] <Imsoverylazy> The best thing you can do in League is uninstall
[0:01:25] <shiny_prinny> i'm ready to see some DUNKS
[0:01:29] <PCBisnotarealroguelike> Pat is playing LoL? What has the world come to?
[0:01:34] <%terminallyCapriciousz> he is
[0:01:37] <bakkatohri> @Imsoverylazy Yeah, and then you install Infinifactory
[0:01:39] <+smitty_werb_> not only does the main have effects, the off hand augments them as well
[0:01:43] <Cycrosa> the only lore i really dont like is how darkin are basically ascended
[0:01:43] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Dunk, Dunk, Dunk, Dunk, Dunk, Dunk, Dunk
[0:01:43] <+smitty_werb_> i count that too
[0:01:45] <RadShiro> THIS IS GONNA BE SO BAD. I cannot fucking wait
[0:01:47] <redrins> hard disagree, as I liked how things used to be but to each their own
[0:01:48] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> he's serious about playing league? Jesus Christ, how horrifying.
[0:01:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> I played three games, got called a useless bad f-word, and I uninstalled it.
[0:01:54] <Goldenwolf98> New champ is made by CertainlyT so its going to be a balancing nightmare and annoying as fuck
[0:01:57] <BigManLugan> is he gonna play with viewers
[0:01:58] <%vixenpunch> Im in love with this timeline
[0:01:59] <based_versauen> Every competitive multiplayer game is a billion times better with everyone else muted. I like modern warfare but I don’t like the ear cancer that comes with it.
[0:02:03] <+ComicLord> wait what's going on
[0:02:07] <MessyBristles> listen guys youtube is dying and he doesnt wanna play minecraft he's gotta do SOMETHING
[0:02:12] <allanmiri> I actually like Mobas but my internet is trash so I can't play them much.
[0:02:13] <%vixenpunch> look if we want peak CSB we need the moba hour on the podcast
[0:02:16] <Graxe_> He's gonna stream some League of Legends
[0:02:19] <Monkroot> I can't tell if he's gonna get hard addicted or get frustrated trying to play with a team of randos and never come back
[0:02:20] <+ComicLord> ComicLord subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:02:26] <Graxe_> Because he's been dabbling in it recently
[0:02:34] <%Fenrirlives> he will not be playing with viewers!
[0:02:37] <CocoonMoon> I heard Bloons TD is very popular on Twitc h
[0:02:40] <SenhorGordon> PAT NO
[0:02:40] <+smitty_werb_> If he can find a duo partner i can see him playing for some time
[0:02:42] <%vixenpunch> they recently moved the datacenter since the last time he played lol
[0:02:42] <avocadosandwitch> love to watch a game i play only because of sunk cost fallacy
[0:02:44] <PCBisnotarealroguelike> I hope he's playing Ranked for that sweet SWEET salt
[0:02:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> he's played one game
[0:02:45] <%vixenpunch> it used to be in cali
[0:02:47] <Meekest> Who is this streaming League of Legends and what did he do to the goblin man
[0:02:49] <+smitty_werb_> he just needs someone in comms to suffer with
[0:02:50] <+mastermindgoblin> @monkroot almost certainly the latter
[0:02:52] <%vixenpunch> now its in the midwest near great lakes
[0:02:56] <Goldenwolf98> @avocadosandwitch same LUL
[0:02:57] <%vixenpunch> so hes got better ping
[0:02:58] <RadShiro> oh Pat is gonna HAAAAATE this becuz he has to rely on teammates! and teammates in LOL suck hard ass
[0:03:00] <MessyBristles> he probably has someone from FF14 he can duo with
[0:03:07] <Supervyxen> I just got here what the fuck is this
[0:03:10] <+smitty_werb_> God i remember when the servers switched
[0:03:13] <%vixenpunch> angriestpat club tag when
[0:03:14] <+smitty_werb_> went from 97 ping to 23
[0:03:16] <Monkroot> @mastermindgoblin hahah yeah thats my guess too, but you never know with this dude
[0:03:16] <PCBisnotarealroguelike> Put in your bets is he gonna play top bottom or adc?
[0:03:18] <%vixenpunch> sub only club
[0:03:19] <avocadosandwitch> @Goldenwolf98 would it be worse to tell you im an adc main
[0:03:21] <%vixenpunch> top
[0:03:21] <%SashaStarshine> Pat stares at selling out
[0:03:24] <MessyBristles> top
[0:03:25] <+BIumen> he will top or mid
[0:03:26] <%vixenpunch> hes a top kind of dude
[0:03:29] <Supervyxen> Pat's gon' play support
[0:03:30] <%vixenpunch> I dont see him ad
[0:03:31] <MessyBristles> he likes beefy bois
[0:03:35] <allanmiri> So hold on... does Pat WANT us to be toxic?
[0:03:37] <%KaizenChaos> Wait what the fuck league????
[0:03:37] <Meekest> Pat's totally a bottom

[0:04:02] <%televisedrevolting> As it turns out Crusader Kings 2 isn't super complicated, I'm just bad at decisionmaking.
[0:04:03] <+mastermindgoblin> I feel like Pats gonna need someone to explain what top,mid,add,etc means
[0:04:04] <+MrTAteMyBalls> pat oh god no what are you doing

[0:04:25] <LorcaNomad> So I need confirmation, is it better that he's not playing Smite?
[0:04:26] <Monkroot> Making this into a seperate vid I guess

[0:06:29] <%bevyrage> i've seen them stream both, but usually crop the UI on the client to not show their username and account info
[0:06:30] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat usually the pro league streamers have two different layouts for the launcher and the game itself
[0:06:32] <WhitePantherZ> everyone streams both
[0:06:32] <Jetsfantasy> Do a practice game to test settings @AngriestPat

[0:10:51] <@ShockzNDrawe> I think a month was too generous
[0:10:52] <%vixenpunch> @AngriestPat Dont speak the names of anyone else in the game, because based on an enemy name you can look up the active game and find you
[0:10:52] <Daxalog> You need to know what your team's doing
[0:10:57] <allanmiri> You want toxic do you?
[0:10:57] <Imsoverylazy> CHAT IS THE MOST FUN PART OF LEAGUE
[0:10:57] <+Jekado> ally chat will help you learn new ethnic slurrs
[0:10:58] <%AncelDeLambert> most of the game settings are IN match, it sucks
[0:10:58] <TG_Cid11> Pat sells out to get veiws
[0:10:58] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @AngriestPat all chat is your enemy chat
[0:10:58] <%JonaFett69> ghosting
[0:10:59] <%GalacticLatte> sniping
[0:10:59] <%s_xylocalsingles> @AngriestPat so you dont get ghostede
[0:10:59] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> you.... MIGHT need team communication in a team game, Pat. MIGHT.
[0:11:00] <M4eta> isn't it text only?

[0:11:00] <%happyface699> Turn my voice off
[0:11:01] <+Xykes> People can ban the characters you want to play
[0:11:01] <%Tallie> so people dont ban your champ
[0:11:01] <+cockburn1994> snipe
[0:11:01] <bakkatohri> It's because picks and bans win games
[0:11:02] <Tunykun> They get sniped and lose on purpose
[0:11:02] <UnfilteredComic> stream sniping/ ghosting
[0:11:03] <PCBisnotarealroguelike> Ghosting is easier in high elo
[0:11:03] <%Tenkay> @AngriestPat Its so people in the same match dont know where they are
[0:11:04] <%SoFarFetched> cause shut up is why
[0:11:04] <kazadog> @AngriestPat snipers
[0:11:04] <Lozzu> Stream sniping
[0:11:04] <reiju_22> sniping
[0:11:04] <TwentyCXII> So people don't queue at the same time as you to snipe your game
[0:11:05] <%s_xylocalsingles> @AngriestPat and sniped they can screenpeak
[0:11:05] <+potatobur> snipe to grief
[0:11:06] <Sumdumguyy> so they don't see your champion select

[0:11:07] <+CliffxThurst> "Missing Ping".
[0:11:08] <MrMysteryMask> snipes
[0:11:08] <%vixenpunch> its so they dont know when you queue so you are harder to snipe
[0:11:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PAIGE STOP HIM
[0:11:08] <+Zxtole> It's because people will message the people they're playing with the enemy locations
[0:11:09] <%Bailey__gaming> member the slur Destiny clan, that but worse
[0:11:11] <%Dre_> thats not true people show the client all the time

[0:11:12] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @AngriestPat high elo has BIG BIG BIG ghosting and sniping issues
[0:11:13] <%Sephirios> to avoid sniping/ghosting mostly
[0:11:14] <%Fenrirlives> Pat you actually need Ally chat dawg

[0:20:21] <+Snaketsu> are you really so worried that you need all these countermeasures
[0:20:21] <IminyourBase> yeah time for you to fail at mobas
[0:20:23] <+GeneralHysterics> It's a different flavor, tho. So.
[0:20:24] <$Dakuu75> dota is the Smash of RTS
[0:20:25] <%Alpha8087> Man the moba community is hella divisive
[0:20:26] <allanmiri> Play Paragon... oh wait...
[0:20:26] <%Dre_> DOTA LUL
[0:20:27] <zipfile777> moba DansGame
[0:20:27] <PunishedMercer_> least dota's characters are all free
[0:20:28] <+Jekado> HotS is fun so its a bad moba
[0:20:29] <SeleneDemorigan> @angriestpat if you add me ill gib skins ye?
[0:20:31] <%Finaldragoon> DotA 2 just added a red goblin lady perfect for Pat this week, oh well
[0:20:33] <+Jekado> moba's shouldn't be fun
[0:20:33] <shevan123> PAT NO WHY
[0:20:33] <reonome> PLAY MINECRAFT
[0:20:34] <Ser_Ser_Ser> I miss Gigantic
[0:20:35] <+CarissMcbober> Dota may the be the better game, but Pat has said that his friends play League, and these type of games are definitely better with friends, so it just makes sense.
[0:20:37] <bakkatohri> Dota isn't horny enough for my weeb tastes
[0:20:39] <Goldenwolf98> Play Battleborn Kappa
[0:20:41] <ReDexuz> just ignore the requests man
[0:20:41] <Supervyxen> Pat please noe
[0:20:42] <Nexoosen> what the fuck why is pat playing LoL, like, i like it, but this is not a matchup i would have expected
[0:20:42] <%terribleusername> Mefense of Ba Ancients
[0:20:43] <shevan123> just play dota its slightly better
[0:20:44] <+Jekado> Gigantic was allright
[0:20:44] <%einheri> Dota is a dead game tho
[0:20:45] <+mccf> is there any character that sits on a cube just like pat is right now?
[0:20:45] <Delenay> who would want to send you a friend request tho
[0:20:45] <+Supernova15_> you have to click the green under your name
[0:20:46] <+immortanjoestar> you can hide your gamertag tho
[0:20:46] <Imsoverylazy> Dota players are just salty that there's only like 20 people to play the game with
[0:20:47] <KexBrew> @AngriestPat did you choose league over dota because your friends are playing it?
[0:20:47] <+Woronov> cmon guys path of exile or riot itmejpH itmejpH
[0:20:48] <%Fenrirlives> @angriestpat how serious are you about not wanting to be gifted things btw?
[0:20:49] <TeaJayGee> why not make a stream account
[0:20:49] <Pyrrhus90> play Battleborn LUL
[0:20:49] <%bevyrage> what you can do instead is max out your friend list
[0:20:52] <UnfilteredComic> Youcan just ignore it, youdont get them in game, only in client
[0:20:56] <Moisthoodie> @AngriestPat you can turn off your name over your hp
[0:20:58] <Decimated_body> I believe that dota is a money laundering scheme valve is apart of.

[0:20:59] <%cureneckbeard> Defense of the Boomers
[0:20:59] <%s_xylocalsingles> @AngriestPat they cap out at 50 requests and dont give you a big notification for em
[0:21:01] <%sectorquack> is this magic the gathering
[0:21:02] <RadShiro> i guess youll just have to play TEAMFIGHT TACTICS
[0:21:04] <%bevyrage> if you've got a full friend list then you can't even receive new requests
[0:21:05] <+Jekado> Play Battleborn before it gets shut down
[0:21:07] <Yubul> It's clearly prep work so Pat knows what characters will be OP in Project L lol
[0:21:07] <%dreamfillah> go play HotS
[0:21:08] <%Chichen> Just get SO MANY FRIENDS
[0:21:08] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @AngriestPat High elo streamers will fill up their friendlist to the cap (50, I think?) to stop people from adding them
[0:21:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
[0:21:11] <%Chichen> that more cant add you
[0:21:12] <OldManDeckardCain> tbf Smite would probably be better for Woolie since it's closer to fighting games but too bad it's run by a shiet mobile company LUL

[0:36:04] <%Malikial> @AngriestPat Also, if you get a mutlikill above 2 kills, at triple kill or above it puts your Summoner name in huge letters on the screen. So, if you do well, exposed.
[0:36:05] <Venchair> I mean the word is censored
[0:36:05] <spinbel> Isn't the filter forced?

[0:51:46] <%ZeroXI> hes
[0:51:47] <%Malikial> No, darius is not a tank, he is a fighter/bruiser.
[0:51:47] <Fancypants25> TBH he got a bad deal
[0:51:48] <MessyBristles> it means hes coming
[0:51:48] <bakkatohri> @AngriestPat W is an auto attack reset. You can attack faster if you use it right after you auto attack
[0:51:49] <Fancypants25> he is coming !
[0:51:49] <+chase959> it was a ping
[0:51:49] <+smitty_werb_> hot damn .1 cs per min
[0:51:50] <%cureneckbeard> ok run in and hit them with your axe
[0:51:50] <$povertysenpai> it means he's coming

[0:51:55] <Skatedeandre> Going against a range as a melee is hell

[0:51:56] <+chase959> to let you know info with typing
[0:51:57] <%FrogROOT> you have to hit them pat
[0:51:57] <+patel347> @AngriestPat your w resets on minions kills

[0:51:59] <shiny_prinny> he pinged that he was coming that way
[0:51:59] <%Albadabar> Duo range destroys Darius
[0:51:59] <bwongdraws> you should ask some friends to run practice games

[0:59:50] <%FrogROOT> ok
[0:59:50] <ProfBadger> can't wait for Pat to learn how to Dunk

[1:00:01] <+potatobur> oh noes the league is kicking in
[1:00:01] <Yubul> @AngriestPat Leveling your abilities evenly is a kind of noob trap. Max one ability first, then move on to the next.
[1:00:01] <$narkonis> @AngriestPat pat needs someone to walk him through this, doing this through chat is not a good idea
[1:00:02] <+gannondaddy> so supportive

[1:00:07] <technicalgoose> i believe in you, pat. you can learn this
[1:00:07] <midnight3> @AngriestPat max one ability at a time
[1:00:08] <+Snorlax321> pat is about to single handedly lose them this game
[1:00:08] <%hawk_rush> apatBaby
[1:00:08] <InXplotch> @AngriestPat after this consider playing against the easiest co-op vs AI setting
[1:00:09] <arkv01> waow TOXIC GAME WutFace
[1:00:10] <$povertysenpai> oh he has 13 cs at 14 minutes
[1:00:11] <MrMysteryMask> @AngriestPat if you're gonna read the chat then you should do that while buying items
[1:00:11] <Run44forrest> actual angery pat
[1:00:12] <Tarviti> He needs to focus on leveling by killing minions
[1:00:13] <Vinniesaurus> 13cs at 15minutes FailFish
[1:00:14] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat pat is actually doing pretty good
[1:00:15] <+Pontios> paige, did pat play the tutorial?
[1:00:15] <cowcow6> league makes u toxic in nature all this stufff is normal
[1:00:15] <%sectorquack> kill minion
[1:00:15] <morningmoondude> Paige being on his side makes him more upsetti
[1:00:16] <Skatedeandre> She’s right
[1:00:17] <+BubbaRands> KOCCHI WO MIRO Jebaited
[1:00:17] <+HalloKeyori111> you're doing well pat, keep it up. Remeber you are big strong and baby
[1:00:17] <+Trimoon333> It's so nice to see the shitter be the shittee @AngriestPat
[1:00:18] <%Albadabar> Pat is still learning guys give him some slack
[1:00:18] <+Jekado> i got to admit this is pretty much the true LoL experience
[1:00:19] <simulationbard> I remeber my first games of league this about par
[1:00:19] <+TheStarvingGood> its not a blowout
[1:00:19] <zeliks91> he is not doing bad all things considered
[1:00:20] <T_Sasquatch> He's not but to be fair you need to not jump into pvp
[1:00:20] <VritraReiRei> @Cymen90 someone else said that and he responded, "Fuck you."
[1:00:23] <MetaFurrical> I've never seen this much talent
[1:00:24] <%whiskey_wolfe_> Yeah Pat listen to Lor from The Weekenders over there dude
[1:00:25] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat stop receiving coaching. This kind of woman based emotional support is killing e-sports. SwiftRage
[1:00:25] <WritebroAlpha> Paige, he needs to last hit the minions. It's so much more important than he realizes.
[1:00:26] <Tunykun> Can Pat press Tab to show the teams standings?
[1:00:26] <Nina96> I can almost taste the salt
[1:00:27] <RipHina> wave clear Kreygasm
[1:00:27] <%juxtest> You have 500 gold
[1:00:28] <Top_Lane_Duelist> it takes to accept that League is a game based AROUND pure multitasking
[1:00:29] <kazadog> hes doing well for this early on he just has a long way to go
[1:00:29] <+ygernesfeld> @AngriestPat It's always better to put one level into each ability, then put one ability to max before the others.
[1:00:29] <The_Hand> pat it genrally takes ppl about 15 games to get a fair idea of how to play teh game.
[1:00:31] <arkv01> pats gonna need his pacifier soon
[1:00:32] <Goldenwolf98> Remember chat this games has NO TUTORIAL whatsoever so he is doing fine
[1:00:36] <UnfilteredComic> Max your q first
[1:00:37] <+Pontios> pat, the next level is to last hit the minions
[1:00:37] <RadShiro> you can buy the Phage now! PogChamp
[1:00:38] <+chase959> no
[1:00:38] <%bevyrage> once you push this lane back to the river/corner then go back to shop and buy the hammer
[1:00:38] <shiny_prinny> no
[1:00:39] <%vixenpunch> no
[1:00:39] <+theballad_tft> you do
[1:00:40] <+MJo367> gotta last hit
[1:00:40] <ProfBadger> Okay, so you see how the gold comes out when you kill something? you don't get it if you don't get the kill, so you want to make sure you kill the last creeps
[1:00:40] <+HyperCharge_Sam> you only get gold if you kill them
[1:00:41] <%Alpha8087> The most important part of playing a carry is getting the last hit on creep. You dont get gold if you dont
[1:00:41] <Moisthoodie> you do
[1:00:41] <NotLysander> no you do
[1:00:41] <bakkatohri> You get into too many fights, you need to focus on farming minions and getting XP. If you're a higher level than everybody else, that means you have more stats with your higher level too.
[1:00:41] <%terribleusername> emotional coaching backfired
[1:00:41] <+potatobur> you get gold for last hitting them
[1:00:42] <%vixenpunch> thats a lie
[1:00:42] <%sectorquack> PHAGE
[1:00:43] <KingOfIronFisting> Get yer mallet
[1:00:43] <%GalacticLatte> the have to last hit them
[1:00:44] <+TheStarvingGood> last hit only
[1:00:45] <BlackermanZX> Yup last hit
[1:00:45] <korickdapally> You do get the gold though
[1:00:46] <%Taisuru> You have to get the last hit to get gold
[1:00:46] <+patel347> you get if blled
[1:00:48] <%TaifuDragon> It does
[1:00:48] <bwongdraws> your bleed works
[1:00:48] <UnfilteredComic> Your bleed does
[1:00:48] <CelioHogane> It does, you just failed
[1:00:48] <+chase959> if you don't hit the last of the health
[1:00:49] <%terminallyCapriciousz> You need to get the last hit, your bleed didn't kill it
[1:00:50] <Imsoverylazy> You do. Your minions are the ones killing them
[1:00:50] <Venchair> Bleed has low damage
[1:00:51] <Skatedeandre> My first game I played alistar and built an IE
[1:00:52] <%galaxyswirl> bleed does give it
[1:00:52] <+Jekado> doesn't kill them fast enough
[1:00:52] <+Valask> the creeps got the kill
[1:00:52] <Sir_Blitz> No, it will. But the tick needs to be what kills them, not another minion.
[1:00:52] <Cymen90> @VritraReiRei Well, I know he wants to play LoL BECAUSE it is easier.
[1:00:53] <+mccf> oh god
[1:00:53] <avocadosandwitch> time your hits
[1:00:53] <Manwad> Your bleed is too low damage.
[1:00:54] <technicalgoose> the damage is low
[1:00:54] <$povertysenpai> it does, you've just been unlucky
[1:00:55] <WritebroAlpha> The bleed isn't killing the minions, your minions are killing them
[1:00:55] <+Rooknasty1> you minions sometimes gets the kill
[1:00:55] <OToole42> @AngriestPat Peach, you're a saint, a good tip for pat, is to let him know just final hitting minions, the bleed does give you gold
[1:00:56] <ContentNotFound> TSM PAT SOON PogChamp
[1:00:56] <%einheri> Pat, as Darius you put ALL your points into Q
[1:00:56] <+patel347> but you bleed isnt ticking right
[1:00:58] <%vixenpunch> your damage needs to be the thing that kills the minion
[1:00:59] <Jontman42> you do but the bleed rarely last hits if there's other damage
[1:00:59] <Yubul> The bleed doesn't do alot of damage on it's own.
[1:00:59] <simulationbard> The other minons re killling them
[1:01:00] <%trustycoyote> Wheatley LUL
[1:01:00] <valriot> Palms are sweaty, Arms short, Coat won't fitty
[1:01:01] <Tunykun> Stream sniper LUL
[1:01:01] <%bevyrage> fight him at minions
[1:01:02] <InXplotch> @AngriestPat you only get gold if YOU deal the final damage. your bleed does give you the gold ,but they are more likely dying to your team's minions
[1:01:02] <%terribleusername> YES
[1:01:02] <Moisthoodie> TSM
[1:01:03] <+Valask> capKEK
[1:01:03] <UnfilteredComic> He'll be nice to you
[1:01:04] <BlackermanZX> LOL
[1:01:04] <@commanderclaw> The bleed does it but allied minions don't count
[1:01:04] <%vixenpunch> the bleed killing it works
[1:01:04] <%Sephirios> yes, bleed counts as last hit but only if the accual bleed tick is the killing dmg
[1:01:04] <%sectorquack> B
[1:01:05] <+Jekado> he's denying!
[1:01:05] <T_Sasquatch> Rip
[1:01:05] <technicalgoose> lol
[1:01:06] <allanmiri> Its our hero!
[1:01:06] <+theballad_tft> if the blead kills you get the money, if it doesn't your minnions are gitting the last hit
[1:01:06] <WritebroAlpha> You don't get gold if your minions kill the minions
[1:01:07] <cimturry> @AngriestPat ur bleed isnt killing enemy minions are
[1:01:07] <NotLysander> HAHA RAGE
[1:01:08] <shiny_prinny> @AngriestPat the bleed would have to deal the last tick of damage to give you gold
[1:01:08] <korickdapally> fucking taunting your ass
[1:01:08] <The_Hand> the bleed can get the gold but what is happening is your minions are killing them before the bleed does. @AngriestPat
[1:01:08] <+HalloKeyori111> you get the last hit when the bleed kills them, it just does so little damage your own minions kill them faster
[1:01:08] <RipHina> LUL zed
[1:01:08] <Skatedeandre> That means your bleed isn’t killing them
[1:01:08] <Venchair> Bleed has low damage that stacks up
[1:01:09] <Imsoverylazy> Bleed Scales with your attack damage
[1:01:09] <nikoloas_> Wheatley no bully pls
[1:01:11] <kazadog> damage on bleed is too low to guarantee the last hit
[1:01:11] <%Albadabar> Bleed proc randomly gets it sometimes, but the proc has to be the last hit, it's not guarenteed
[1:01:11] <Owlboy7> @AngriestPat Darius q does more damage and heals more with the edge of the circle
[1:01:11] <+mccf> uy guys suk
[1:01:11] <ThirdPersonPhil> NEVER SURRENDER!

[1:01:12] <ProfBadger> wait, did he turn on chat?
[1:01:13] <%thesnugglelord> @angriestpat I would suggest learning the basics against ai before playing against people
[1:01:14] <Goldenwolf98> YOU GUYS SUK I SEE THE ZED LUL
[1:01:14] <%yasahiro1011> PAT SPEND YOUR SKILL POINTS

[1:01:15] <trueherobappo> @angriestpat As much as i would love to see you bumblefuck your way through, i honestly suggest playing with someone who knows how to play. But i understand what your doing and it makes me happy to see someone learn the game.
[1:01:17] <technicalgoose> this guy gets it

[1:01:41] <+Snorlax321> NAH snipe him harder
[1:01:43] <%Verd_254> well, he did ask for the toxic.
[1:01:44] <+GeneralHysterics> Wheatly seeing your screen doesn't mater too much, tho
[1:01:44] <+Jekado> oh yeah we hit the 15 mark
[1:01:44] <+CarissMcbober> Maximum snipe from wheatley
[1:01:45] <WritebroAlpha> Paige, let him know his W resets the timer on his basic attack
[1:01:45] <BlackermanZX> Your minions are killng them so you dont get gold. you get exp tho @AngriestPat
[1:01:47] <The_Hand> pat if you look at map they are in your base
[1:01:47] <%umbypokochan> yeah this isn't DS2
[1:01:47] <NotLysander> look at your base
[1:01:47] <simulationbard> Quick Xpex backdoor right now
[1:01:47] <InXplotch> in hots there is no gold so it doesnt matter how the minions die
[1:01:48] <%SoFarFetched> @AngriestPat Should have enough for the hammer now.
[1:01:50] <%GarbageNirvana> That's a fine way to get banned son
[1:01:50] <VritraReiRei> I agree, he's being an ass, not even giving Pat a fair chance to like this game :(
[1:01:52] <PCBisnotarealroguelike> Wheatley already has TWO items IT'S OVER
[1:01:53] <+gannondaddy> "toxic"
[1:01:53] <ProfBadger> you can afford a phage now, at least.
[1:01:54] <+ren173> Pat what are you doing
[1:01:55] <%FrogROOT> thanks :)
[1:01:56] <Run44forrest> just ban him Kappa
[1:01:56] <morningmoondude> Pat can't handle Wheatly's TOXICNESS
[1:01:57] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat LOUD SHITPOSTING
[1:01:57] <%dasmause> bleed does count as a lasthit, minions are just killstealing
[1:01:59] <astreas13> I couldn't expect better from a man named Whatley, to be fair.
[1:02:00] <ThirdPersonPhil> He has to be in the Bush man
[1:02:01] <%augusm> Who the fuck is Wheatley?
[1:02:03] <+Jekado> no last hitting either
[1:02:04] <$narkonis> hots is just exp
[1:02:04] <shinbuya> at least don't say u sniped smart guy FailFish
[1:02:04] <valriot> Pat playing Leauge: "Guys, DONT be toxic"
[1:02:04] <%honeyman18> Honestly league is visual nonsense to me, so Pat looks like he's doing great.
[1:02:05] <RadShiro> @AngriestPat for leveling up skills, you should NOT even them out. Max out the skill you use the most first
[1:02:06] <TeaJayGee> help mid
[1:02:08] <+discouragedoblong> Man watching this really reminds me of the early days and how bad I was at league
[1:02:08] <technicalgoose> he got canon, he's a god
[1:02:09] <suikudo> Lets be real we all knew pat wasnt gonna like this game
[1:02:09] <+JrSpore> wait pat is playing league?
[1:02:10] <+swaggopotamus> this is the real league experience.
[1:02:10] <%Shadowthedigger> Oh my god Recal
[1:02:10] <ProfBadger> That's fair
[1:02:10] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Pat's "W" is an attack reset, he can use it between attacks for an INSTANT attack
[1:02:11] <%Bailey__gaming> League is hard
[1:02:12] <%SGrim> @augusm the other Darius
[1:02:12] <%sectorquack> please tell pat to buy phage
[1:02:12] <korickdapally> dont focus on leveling your E
[1:02:14] <+CallMeThePurge> Does anyone have any more tips for Pat? I’m trying to take notes as well uhnGasm
[1:02:15] <+Jekado> i didn't know until i read that
[1:02:15] <%SlackerAlex> Wheatly cant even be funny toxic
[1:02:16] <Run44forrest> @augusm @WheatlyXT
[1:02:17] <cimturry> You wanna put you rpoints into q ability first, spreading them out like that isnt great
[1:02:17] <%SvenHolgersson> Max your Q Pat
[1:02:17] <Fancypants25> cannon PogChamp
[1:02:19] <+GeneralHysterics> hammer get
[1:02:19] <zenith0111> TOXIC CHAT
[1:02:20] <+chase959> then the big black axe
[1:02:20] <+Rooknasty1> nice
[1:02:21] <%SvenHolgersson> Its your BnB
[1:02:21] <Tunykun> Ctrl+3 = that darius dance that wheatly is doing btw
[1:02:22] <+Robopengy> Is there a courier in LoL?
[1:02:23] <ashe_strachan> this is wrong
[1:02:23] <ProfBadger> All MOBA's have readability problems.
[1:02:23] <UnfilteredComic> And build into Black Cleaver
[1:02:23] <MessyBristles> @AngriestPat Pat you should get the Blitz app it will load runes and an item list for your character its best for starting out.
[1:02:24] <+patel347> remember to walk away to cancel autos so your auto attack timer doesnt prevent you from attacking to last hit
[1:02:24] <T_Sasquatch> Real talk, mobas have a reason for being the most toxic genre. You can't help it
[1:02:24] <korickdapally> focus the Q then the W, E is last befcause its mostly utility
[1:02:24] <TheWashoutXY> Tell Pat to upgrade his Q first
[1:02:24] <BlackermanZX> nice
[1:02:25] <%FrogROOT> that sucks
[1:02:25] <ReDexuz> double click to buy
[1:02:25] <Picia000123> YAY
[1:02:27] <+discouragedoblong> LOL
[1:02:27] <arkv01> pat if you can't play league how will you join an esports team to win the 10 MILLION DOLLARS PRIZE POOL FOR DOTA
[1:02:27] <Saiyza> Level abilities to max one at a time
[1:02:28] <Ser_Ser_Ser> Number go up!
[1:02:29] <+HyperCharge_Sam> its not visual Pat
[1:02:30] <ddosd_by_door> max ur q b4 puting points into ur other abilities
[1:02:30] <kazadog> spreading skill points out is inadvisable
[1:02:31] <+Rewrench> icon was more like a wooden spoon
[1:02:32] <shiny_prinny> slot 3 has the hammer
[1:02:32] <+Snaketsu> chat turning on Wheatly FeelsBadMan
[1:02:32] <+HalloKeyori111> the hammer builds into an even stronger item
[1:02:32] <%skizzuto> the items don't affect your appearance
[1:02:32] <WritebroAlpha> Next you buy Black Cleaver
[1:02:33] <Jarvanii> Pat E is the worst ability to put points into as darius
[1:02:33] <+TheStarvingGood> big number
[1:02:34] <UnfilteredComic> Number go up
[1:02:35] <Jetsfantasy> Items don't show on char, it's just for stats
[1:02:35] <Imsoverylazy> @AngriestPat Definitely choose one skill to level up rather than trying to evenly spread the levels
[1:02:35] <dero45> getting stronger
[1:02:35] <bwongdraws> pat, treat items like invisible stat gear
[1:02:35] <%FrogROOT> Q
[1:02:36] <+Jekado> items generally are not cosmetic
[1:02:37] <Moisthoodie> @AngriestPat its all stat sticks
[1:02:38] <bakkatohri> Auto attack resets let you attack immediately after doing a right click on people
[1:02:39] <%bevyrage> hammer is the item, but your skin won't change with items you purchase most of the time
[1:02:40] <midnight3> @AngriestPat MAX ONE ABILITY AT A TIME PLEASE
[1:02:40] <%GarbageNirvana> This is why I played Malz, you get your own minions
[1:02:40] <%cureneckbeard> it's a very sharp hammer pat
[1:02:40] <+Noponiz> damn, some good last hits for a support Kappa
[1:02:40] <Owlboy7> @AngriestPat at least read what the items do LUL
[1:02:41] <The_Hand> your weapon doesnt physically change your stats and item abilities do tho. @AngriestPat
[1:02:43] <Skatedeandre> @angriestpat I would say mute the client audio and hide the screen so people won’t know when you start your q
[1:02:44] <Tarviti> Start buying parts for the next item now if you can
[1:02:45] <Goldenwolf98> Honestly at early level fighting bots is the best for getting a hang of this game
[1:02:45] <bruno_silv0> Pat have you tryed smite?
[1:02:48] <WritebroAlpha> Phage upgrades into Black Cleaver, which you want to buy next
[1:02:48] <issyexoao> @AngriestPat only upgrade one skill at a time
[1:02:49] <BlackermanZX> just cosmetic glows n shiz
[1:02:50] <$povertysenpai> is pat having fun at all tho
[1:02:50] <$Chimeraelite> oh Pat would be playing Darius
[1:02:51] <kajio3033> don't tell him about auto-attack resets lmao
[1:02:51] <+Masutasodo> Items are stats essentially
[1:02:51] <ProfBadger> maybe let's not getinto AA resets.
[1:02:51] <InXplotch> @AngriestPat the items are just stats and special effects, they dont have cosmetic changes to your character
[1:02:53] <MrAccidentProne> PAT: The bleed does count if its the bleed damage tick that kills it. make sure ya last hit minions and bu parts of items. weapons don't replace your current one, ther are just items for more stats
[1:02:54] <BimboBagging> Paige tell Pat he can animation cancel his auto attacks with W
[1:02:55] <Venchair> Pat isn't doing the worst but he's still missing a lot of fundamentals
[1:02:56] <PCBisnotarealroguelike> Next game put your skills into just one ability don't even them out
[1:02:56] <valriot> @angriestpat Why does this game announcer sound like Paiges old lady voice???
[1:02:57] <%Tuskor13> There's a character in this game whose passive ability is that they can't buy Boots
[1:02:58] <seycheles> monkaS
[1:02:58] <+cyberpunk998> @AngriestPat It doesn't change you in a visible way, it just adds stats to your character
[1:03:00] <+discouragedoblong> Items are just stat stuff not cosmetic, some give u a visual indicator to indicate stuff tho
[1:03:02] <Tunykun> Pat, your team chat isn't muted
[1:03:02] <+Jekado> yikes 17 to 38
[1:03:03] <%Catorak> I have no idea why people in here would want to snipe and make his game harder. I get wanting to play with Pat for funsies but actively making his experience worse by trolling in game while he's trying to learn an insane amount of information and mechanics is super fucked. Suuuper fucked.
[1:03:03] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat "hammer" and all gear are basically plugins in nier, no direct representation, but some require activation
[1:03:08] <triphdog420> go next
[1:03:09] <OToole42> @AngriestPat his e skill is an attack reset, think of it as a animation reset, attack + E +attack for good damage and to secure the cannons
[1:03:10] <kajio3033> AA resets are above his paygrade atm
[1:03:10] <arkv01> chat did you do this, did you make him play darius
[1:03:11] <%FrogROOT> put an image over the map or something
[1:03:12] <Manwad> If you use W to last hit, W will refresh.
[1:03:13] <IminyourBase> just hit last
[1:03:14] <Skatedeandre> @angriestpat match searching = q/queue
[1:03:15] <MrMysteryMask> @AngriestPat the items you buy is just a representation of added stat bonus
[1:03:15] <bwongdraws> pat, treat items like invisible stat gear
[1:03:15] <Sir_Blitz> It's startling how intelligent this chat is compared to your typical League of Legends stream, for real LUL
[1:03:17] <RipHina> last hitting takes practice
[1:03:21] <%MaddyCaddy> That's a little advanced
[1:03:21] <arkv01> this is NOT a beginner friendly champion
[1:03:21] <tigerfang86> just hit last 4Head
[1:03:24] <$narkonis> its not
[1:03:24] <gensoukaizou> Very good CS
[1:03:25] <ashe_strachan> @AngriestPat Just move your cam onto the game map..Best way to stop stream snipers
[1:03:25] <%Big_Dream> Big_Dream subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[1:03:26] <%vixenpunch> its not
[1:03:26] <IminyourBase> JUST HIT LAST
[1:03:27] <%vixenpunch> we see it
[1:03:29] <dero45> Smite and Paragon are better than this imo rip Paragon
[1:03:29] <+Masutasodo> We just saw it
[1:03:29] <+BIumen> all chat not ally chat?
[1:03:30] <NotLysander> Look at it, it's totally not muted
[1:03:30] <$povertysenpai> he muted allied chat, not enemy chat
[1:03:31] <+Angrec> hey he got a last hit finally!
[1:03:31] <%ZeroXI> its coming up
[1:03:31] <+PBJammy> I never thought I'd see this
[1:03:32] <%Tuskor13> The Zed talked tho
[1:03:32] <valriot> N WORD TIME PogChamp
[1:03:32] <Ris_Eltrut> @angriestpat have you done the tutorial?
[1:03:32] <ProfBadger> there it is
[1:03:32] <RipHina> its not zed ita big upsetti
[1:03:32] <+swaggopotamus> items don't actually, they are just Stat and effect bonuses.
[1:03:32] <+CallMeThePurge> Paige can you ask Pat... if he’s enjoying himself????
[1:03:33] <%terminallyCapriciousz> All chat is still on
[1:03:33] <simulationbard> I just say saw it
[1:03:33] <%Ranryu692> I just saw someone call Wheaty a mark-ass trick
[1:03:33] <%bevyrage> you had a message pop up from annie a minute ago
[1:03:34] <Swish19XX> I saw it, someon said yu guys suk
[1:03:35] <%FrogROOT> oop its not
[1:03:35] <BlackermanZX> Its not actually
[1:03:36] <$Chimeraelite> It's an acquired skill 100%
[1:03:36] <nikoloas_> you didn't
[1:03:37] <VritraReiRei> we can see it right there though
[1:03:38] <%CarcerDun> he's better at last hitting now
[1:03:39] <%SvenHolgersson> Darius is easy af
[1:03:39] <KingOfIronFisting> They are in your base DUDE
[1:03:39] <+Zxtole> Darius is definitely beginner friendly
[1:03:40] <InXplotch> Darius is actually pretty easy
[1:03:40] <%vixenpunch> darius is very beginner freindly
[1:03:40] <PCBisnotarealroguelike> You din't mute all chat
[1:03:41] <CelioHogane> ANNIE
[1:03:41] <UnfilteredComic> Yes it is
[1:03:42] <%bevyrage> blue is an ally
[1:03:42] <+BubbaRands> But he looks cool
[1:03:43] <+discouragedoblong> Why is he playing darius bot btw?
[1:03:43] <%SoFarFetched> @AngriestPat it's on still,the annie on your team said something.
[1:03:43] <Moisthoodie> hes good for new players
[1:03:44] <+Jekado> they are pushing mid
[1:03:44] <kazadog> darius is easy af wtf
[1:03:44] <%immortanjoestar> lmao darius is braindead
[1:03:45] <TheWashoutXY> Thats all chat
[1:03:47] <simulationbard> Darius is pretty simple
[1:03:47] <bwongdraws> they are pat
[1:03:47] <WritebroAlpha> But they are talking
[1:03:48] <The_Hand> lol
[1:03:48] <Saiyza> He USED to be beginner friendly.
[1:03:48] <%vixenpunch> what
[1:03:48] <RipHina> annie is litteraslly talking
[1:03:49] <nikoloas_> yes it is
[1:03:49] <+patel347> daruis is beginner
[1:03:49] <Venchair> that's ally chat it's in blue
[1:03:50] <$povertysenpai> wait no he does have it on
[1:03:50] <Imsoverylazy> Darius is fine, he just got outranged
[1:03:51] <PCBisnotarealroguelike> You need to mute all chat
[1:03:51] <%bevyrage> BLUE = ALLY RED = ENEMY
[1:03:52] <@JustinianKnight> it is on
[1:03:52] <Malikial> The reason phage is useful is that when you auto attack or kill anything, minions included it gives you bonus movement speed so darius can run down people easily.
[1:03:53] <+HyperCharge_Sam> the blue text are your allies tho
[1:03:53] <ProfBadger> ..wait, is it ally chat or ALL chat.
[1:03:53] <Metrick_92> Bruh your base is dying lmao
[1:03:54] <%vixenpunch> there is no voice chat pat
[1:03:54] <astreas13> @AngriestPat He muted all chat, not ally. All chat is when you see talking from the enemy team.
[1:03:55] <chidere> Pat might like playing Jungle
[1:03:55] <lomack42> oh he meant voicechat
[1:03:55] <arkv01> you guys aren't thinking from the perspective of an absolute beginner
[1:03:56] <+gannondaddy> allied chat is on
[1:03:57] <%dasmause> darius is difficulty 2/3 tho?
[1:03:58] <%ZeroXI> f
[1:03:58] <%SvenHolgersson> He's a starter for top lane
[1:04:01] <%vixenpunch> muting chat means text
[1:04:02] <Jarvanii> I think pat "all chat" was allied chat
[1:04:02] <simulationbard> Also that is chat it's just no one's talking
[1:04:03] <%FrogROOT> buttdown
[1:04:04] <technicalgoose> DUNK HIM
[1:04:04] <nikoloas_> ally chat is blue names enemy chat is red names
[1:04:05] <Scrub_Lord> atpTopSpeed
[1:04:08] <Skatedeandre> All chat
[1:04:08] <Zedimonx5> If MMOs are anti-Woolie, are mobas anti-Pat?
[1:04:09] <Yubul> After putting 1 point in each ability, you're better off maxing 1 ability at a time rather than all of them evenly.
[1:04:09] <MessyBristles> you probably muted voice chat
[1:04:09] <TheWashoutXY> Garen is the beginner friendlier version of Darius @AngriestPat
[1:04:09] <%Shadowthedigger> What isn't beginner friendly is your bot lane taking top from you
[1:04:10] <gensoukaizou> LUL
[1:04:10] <lomack42> oh he turned off allchat
[1:04:10] <+patel347> type /mute all
[1:04:11] <PCBisnotarealroguelike> LUL
[1:04:11] <+Zxtole> Lanes don't matter at this level
[1:04:11] <Imsoverylazy> Darius is beginner friendly in Top lane. Playing him bot is a bad idea in general
[1:04:14] <ProfBadger> there we go
[1:04:15] <suikudo> Ignore what they do
[1:04:15] <+FrenchTact1cs> Darius is fairly simple
[1:04:16] <reonome> F
[1:04:17] <+theballad_tft> at pat type "/mute all"
[1:04:17] <studleydoorite> Darius became easy as soon as Pat said "yeah I know he's hard to learn"
[1:04:18] <Tarviti> This game 100% wasn't your fault you had a shit team
[1:04:19] <+Jekado> in low rank people to play lanes right
[1:04:19] <%dasmause> if you want beginner friendly get garen
[1:04:19] <%cureneckbeard> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[1:04:20] <%ComicLord> they are literally talking
[1:04:20] <BlackermanZX> there ya go
[1:04:22] <+patel347> type /mute all to mute them
[1:04:22] <+discouragedoblong> Are you playing draft or blind?
[1:04:23] <arkv01> yeah Garen is much better for absolute beginners
[1:04:23] <bwongdraws> and that is why its super rough playing top laners in blind
[1:04:23] <%SashaStarshine> @AngriestPat You should pick 1 damage skill to max alongside your ultimate and leave your other skills at 1-2 points while you play around the skill you are focusing on
[1:04:25] <theKingRamses> @Imsoverylazy 2 other people followed him top
[1:04:25] <bakkatohri> @AngriestPat You can mute people by clicking on stuff in the tab menu
[1:04:26] <MrAccidentProne> don't worry about this one pat, your team totally fucked you from the start
[1:04:26] <ProfBadger> it's fine, there's noting gained from chat at this point
[1:04:26] <%FrogROOT> what is the difference between lanes?
[1:04:26] <Supervyxen> @AngriestPat Type "/fullmute all" to mute everything
[1:04:27] <%SvenHolgersson> It happens when your early level just get a feel for who you like
[1:04:28] <suikudo> You have to go where your character belongs are you are just gonna get farmed
[1:04:28] <InXplotch> Are these people from Pat's discord o rsomething?
[1:04:28] <$narkonis> Ya you can
[1:04:28] <+NobuuNobuu> Why is pat playing lol????
[1:04:29] <%Ranryu692> should probably play against AI until you're more familiar with the game
[1:04:29] <a_wizard_in_space> Yeah that Riven fucked you by taking top.
[1:04:30] <chaos2frozen> pat is bottom?
[1:04:31] <shinbuya> play vs bots
[1:04:31] <shockmaster3> I never thought I would see the day
[1:04:32] <valriot> Pat goes bottom huh? Kappa Kappa
[1:04:32] <ReDexuz> BUY PARTS
[1:04:32] <%Agami23> thats why you talk in the lobby
[1:04:32] <T_Sasquatch> Yea you're a bottom alright LUL
[1:04:34] <UnfilteredComic> Build into Black Cleaver
[1:04:37] <+patel347> you turned off all chat
[1:04:38] <midnight3> Darius is not started champion btw
[1:04:38] <simulationbard> League's learning curve is long and gradual
[1:04:38] <IminyourBase> @AngriestPat don't worry about positions and stuff too much right now just learn the fundamentals
[1:04:38] <$narkonis> @AngriestPat yes you can theres way more items then what you see there
[1:04:39] <InXplotch> or is he playing with random people?
[1:04:39] <lomack42> buy parts!!
[1:04:40] <Skatedeandre> You have to do a in game chat command
[1:04:40] <%Takreth> Thanks Paige
[1:04:40] <The_Hand> @AngriestPat if you want to gurantee your lane the only way to do that is draft pick not blind pick
[1:04:41] <%ZeroXI> buy itemss
[1:04:41] <TheWashoutXY> Yeah play vs bots
[1:04:42] <shockmaster3> when pat plays league
[1:04:42] <%Albadabar> Yeah Darius gets screwed against range, and fighting two ranged laners is gonna be hell for him for sure
[1:04:42] <nikoloas_> you could just type /mute all at the start of the game
[1:04:42] <kajio3033> play vs bots for a while
[1:04:43] <bwongdraws> play bots to get used to game mechanics
[1:04:43] <suikudo> YES
[1:04:45] <%cureneckbeard> hi paige
[1:04:45] <Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat honestly the best way to play league when you are just getting started is against bots cause the game doesnt teach you shit
[1:04:45] <vinrugo> Yeah the problem you're aving now is only a problem in Blin pick, in Draft you pick your lane ahead of time.
[1:04:46] <shinbuya> co-op vs ai
[1:04:46] <Masamune195> protect now
[1:04:47] <+CallMeThePurge> Patrick are you having fun???! I’m worried your blood pressure is rising!!
[1:04:47] <%sectorquack> hes a switch
[1:04:47] <%MaddyCaddy> @AngriestPat Try playing bot games to get used to the feeling of the game before playing with real players
[1:04:47] <+theballad_tft> pat you turrned of voice chat, not text chat
[1:04:48] <BlackermanZX> Build Black Cleaver for Darius
[1:04:48] <Imsoverylazy> Just play Yasuo, because he can lane literally anywhere and win easily
[1:04:48] <%immortanjoestar> in early games the players dont follow the meta rules because they dont know them
[1:04:48] <kazadog> @a_wizard_in_space riven AND annie
[1:04:50] <wafflegear> this is normal
[1:04:52] <NotLysander> you are past laneing phase
[1:04:52] <+patel347> you switched off enemy chat not freinly chat
[1:04:52] <valriot> Paige pls LUL
[1:04:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I like the characters. I dont know about playing the game
[1:04:54] <%Valdorick> Well, now you have to clutch defend and take your L
[1:04:55] <%ZeroXI> best paige
[1:04:56] <Venchair> Losing top doesn't matter much, at this level without smites lanes are double lanes anyway
[1:04:58] <%SvenHolgersson> Well at the beginning yea Darius is a great bully in top lane
[1:04:58] <+Jekado> don't bother with last hitting at this point
[1:04:58] <Jetsfantasy> You need to play against AI just to learn items and the map first
[1:04:59] <riotshark> this is not something I was expecting to see ya play this is new
[1:05:01] <WritebroAlpha> Open shop, click on Phage, click on the red axe above the components and buy a Kindlegem
[1:05:03] <midnight3> his kit is simple but not a starter champion tho !!!
[1:05:04] <Tarviti> Playing Support or ADC are the easiest ways to learn the game
[1:05:05] <Manwad> Think of playing bots as labbing.
[1:05:05] <%SlackerAlex> You're doing great Paige
[1:05:09] <+seaearthandsky> what the fuck timeline is this where pat is playing fucking league? @AngriestPat
[1:05:09] <xanner420> Tell him to use w to farm if he last hits with it he gets man and cdr back
[1:05:09] <Belutima> Omg he is actually playing league
[1:05:09] <kajio3033> game's over, don't worry about it
[1:05:11] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Paige : Tell him to build the second component for BLACK CLEAVER
[1:05:11] <bwongdraws> pre-fun
[1:05:12] <%mostundesired> And now the fun begins...
[1:05:13] <%cureneckbeard> paige did you ever notice how pat has the same hairstyle of Captain Picard
[1:05:14] <%SvenHolgersson> As usual Paige rules
[1:05:15] <ProfBadger> Look, league is basically entirely about self-improvement
[1:05:15] <valriot> PRE-FUN Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:05:15] <MahoganyWoods> oh nooooo whats he doing?
[1:05:15] <%FrogROOT> that sucks
[1:05:16] <a_wizard_in_space> at this point it's best to just defend and farm up some cash.
[1:05:17] <suikudo> Because you spent so long in bottom lane you are hella underleveled
[1:05:18] <+TheBesteban> This is not a game to learn on stream
[1:05:19] <Tunykun> The learning curve is really high
[1:05:19] <shiny_prinny> PRE-FUN
[1:05:19] <alrobot2014> he
[1:05:20] <+Masutasodo> Just start with hit enemy till die
[1:05:20] <kazadog> need just one person coah\ching him
[1:05:21] <$narkonis> using chat for this is a horrible idea i
[1:05:22] <tigerfang86> ENDLESS advice
[1:05:22] <mistakencasual> Finna pre
[1:05:22] <Yubul> Guys, cut Pat some slack. This is one of the first games he's played. League has a big learning curve.
[1:05:22] <+patel347> you switched off enemy chat not freindly chat
[1:05:22] <+JrSpore> you might be better using some of your subs to team up with until u get the hang of stuff
[1:05:22] <korickdapally> Pat, you should have MAYBE sat down and read a primer or something
[1:05:22] <+Double_Tap_That> Is that like precum?
[1:05:22] <upandadam> has anyone said play dota yet?
[1:05:23] <%SashaStarshine> The grind informs the fluff
[1:05:23] <+HalloKeyori111> People will give you advice thats really not important until later, just go with the flow dude
[1:05:24] <Sir_Blitz> Like all 60 levels of WoW. Pre-fun.
[1:05:24] <%Explodincatz> i like that naming
[1:05:24] <shockmaster3> all you can do now is farm
[1:05:25] <Kazic5000> Is Pat doing a bounty or something? I never would have thought he'd be into this game.
[1:05:25] <BinaryShuffle> There is no fun in League, there is only anger
[1:05:25] <TheWashoutXY> Nope
[1:05:26] <$povertysenpai> i feel like it'd be so much easier if you just had someone in call that knows how to play the game
[1:05:26] <%terribleusername> he's pre-funning all over that can
[1:05:26] <%umbypokochan> i love pre-fun, it's better than actual fun
[1:05:28] <OToole42> @AngriestPat if you want a ranged toplaner Ryze can fit the bill, big blue man, throws magic
[1:05:29] <bwongdraws> its why warframe is so much fun. study and then execute
[1:05:29] <reonome> its ok pat you can always blame your teammates Kappa
[1:05:29] <shinbuya> play vs AI macaiy1Smile
[1:05:29] <Owlboy7> IS THIS TWITCH PLAYS LOL?
[1:05:31] <suddenlyscorched> I popped in to see how it's going and it's NOT GOING WELL HUH
[1:05:32] <+BubbaRands> So much pre Kappa
[1:05:33] <Ralamar> @AngriestPat You should play around in the practice tool for a bit, read the items, get use to last hitting, and stuff
[1:05:33] <Bakefowl> Play against bots
[1:05:33] <InXplotch> He's very strong compared to you, yes
[1:05:33] <+Xykes> League has one of the steepest learning curves of any game type so take your time <3
[1:05:34] <%SvenHolgersson> Yea ain't no coming back from this
[1:05:34] <Johnso1o> It might be a better idea for him to play against enemy bots before diving into blind pick, just until he gets more of the basics down.
[1:05:34] <GoldySUP> pre-fun in lol lasts until you quit the game LUL
[1:05:35] <simulationbard> Just play it out
[1:05:36] <suikudo> You cant really touch anyone because you are so underleveled
[1:05:36] <RipHina> yeah chat is giving you information overload
[1:05:37] <PCBisnotarealroguelike> The game is over already they have so many items
[1:05:37] <Skatedeandre> League pre level 30 is all pre-fun
[1:05:37] <shockmaster3> and get money
[1:05:38] <%honeyman18> Colors go do things, that's about what I got here
[1:05:38] <+Rooknasty1> that was a good combo
[1:05:38] <Bigdax> play bots
[1:05:40] <Jetsfantasy> PVP is overwhelming to learn the game with at first
[1:05:41] <BlackermanZX> Its ok anyway just learn
[1:05:42] <Tunykun> Press Tab to see Darius score Pat
[1:05:42] <%FrogROOT> ouch
[1:05:42] <valriot> Guys, Paige calls it "Pre-fun" Kappa
[1:05:43] <+Okosisi89> The game's really enigmatic at low level. You really oughta find someone from your discord or something to help explain the moment to moment stuff.
[1:05:43] <UnfilteredComic> The kills are 19 to 48
[1:05:43] <Masamune195> it's over. but good try pat!
[1:05:43] <%ZeroXI> ggd
[1:05:44] <T_Sasquatch> This is why you play bots
[1:05:45] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat are ya winnin, son?
[1:05:45] <Run44forrest> get someone on your team to talk you through it
[1:05:45] <IminyourBase> see that's how you play darius
[1:05:46] <%goose_attack_almanac> The score is 19 to 46
[1:05:46] <%ZeroXI> ggs
[1:05:47] <nikoloas_> honestly you should just get someone to talk you through stuff over discord
[1:05:47] <$narkonis> Uhhhhhhhh
[1:05:48] <%MaddyCaddy> They were bots
[1:05:50] <BluBox> It's like fighting games. Pre-fun is getting beat up for 50 matches until you understand the game
[1:05:50] <%vixenpunch> huh
[1:05:51] <+Jekado> first game is free
[1:05:52] <pigliiplays> I think that's a bot game pat
[1:05:52] <$povertysenpai> was it a bot game
[1:05:52] <gensoukaizou> jesus
[1:05:53] <%SashaStarshine> Was it vs bots Pat?
[1:05:54] <UnfilteredComic> Were they bots?
[1:05:54] <ProfBadger> or being toxicactually if you click on the other Darius you can see what they built, that might help you.
[1:05:55] <+BIumen> bots?
[1:05:55] <ReDexuz> carried hard
[1:05:55] <+cyberpunk998> SIXTY SIX?????
[1:05:56] <%SoFarFetched> Look at that one person still on top lane LUL
[1:05:56] <%vixenpunch> bot game
[1:05:57] <%KaizenChaos> The Fuc
[1:05:57] <+discouragedoblong> how does a gae last taht long?
[1:05:58] <Tarviti> They have levels and items over you meaning you would have to farm to even it out
[1:05:58] <+crackheadcontrol> league is a game of big swings from match to match
[1:05:59] <Cymen90> Those were BOTS
[1:05:59] <%galaxyswirl> was it bots?
[1:05:59] <reiju_22> @AngriestPat you should play more against bots
[1:05:59] <bruno_silv0> @angriestpat you need to learn to know when to run away, there is situations that you know you are fuck at a glance to you need yo run away this will come with time
[1:06:00] <shinbuya> play vs AI :)
[1:06:01] <Venchair> But yeah make sure you go into options and get Smartcast on before your next game
[1:06:02] <technicalgoose> this is a practice game, doesnt count
[1:06:02] <%sectorquack> boosted
[1:06:04] <PCBisnotarealroguelike> That's because you're playing with smurfs @AngriestPat
[1:06:04] <TheWashoutXY> Play vs Bots to learn
[1:06:05] <zeliks91> @AngriestPat the problem is you are a melee against 2 actual bot lane characters. The fact that 2 other people went top and you had to go bot alone
[1:06:05] <%SoFarFetched> Yeah it's all real people.
[1:06:05] <NotLysander> So this is why people rage quit. It takes 1 or 2 good players or 1 or 2 bad players to tilt a game hard
[1:06:05] <Sir_Blitz> Well it sure doesn't help that there's someone smurfing on the other team that clearly sniped and knows what they're doing LUL
[1:06:05] <lomack42> buy parts
[1:06:06] <%immortanjoestar> darius should go top lane normally but new players dont understand the meta so thats why pat couldnt go top
[1:06:06] <%SashaStarshine> Oh fair enough then
[1:06:06] <shockmaster3> gg
[1:06:07] <%Ranryu692> you should do vs bots
[1:06:07] <%MaddyCaddy> You can matchmake bot games
[1:06:07] <+patel347> honestly for second gameyou played pretty good
[1:06:08] <ThirdPersonPhil> basically this but inverted you are just on the other team
[1:06:08] <Jetsfantasy> Bots is matchmade too
[1:06:08] <$povertysenpai> check match history you can see
[1:06:09] <$narkonis> You should play vs bots to get used to controls
[1:06:09] <%SvenHolgersson> Never play vs bots thats fucking a waste of time
[1:06:09] <+discouragedoblong> coop vs ai?
[1:06:09] <+BruceyG> gg
[1:06:10] <TeaJayGee> this is how you learn
[1:06:10] <%thesnugglelord> @angriestpat I think it would be more beneficial to play with one experienced person against some ai first to get the basics down instead of trying to read advice from 100+ people
[1:06:10] <Kalcom> it was bots
[1:06:10] <bwongdraws> you should practice with bots, its not baby mode, its learning mode
[1:06:10] <bakkatohri> @AngriestPat Kill minions, get gold, and then get items.
[1:06:11] <+HalloKeyori111> this is just warmup
[1:06:11] <%wujak> most early level games just come down to which team got the person smurfing
[1:06:12] <%Taisuru> Was it agaist bots pat?
[1:06:12] <Tunykun> Snipers :) :( :(
[1:06:12] <%juxtest> You can still win
[1:06:13] <Imsoverylazy> Bots is matchmade
[1:06:13] <%Takreth> You might have been pushed into alt-account territory
[1:06:13] <redrins> you can matchmake vs bots
[1:06:13] <Cymen90> All first games are BOTS
[1:06:13] <+Helljump3r6> moba's are quiet snowbally
[1:06:13] <kajio3033> bot games, dude
[1:06:13] <SummonerMagno> now youre the 11
[1:06:13] <UnfilteredComic> Bots is matchmade too
[1:06:15] <+Rooknasty1> good start
[1:06:15] <shinbuya> play vs AI :) ..
[1:06:16] <kazadog> you should play bots honestly
[1:06:16] <%FrogROOT> the feet
[1:06:17] <%Dulzara> Way better than I did on my early games.
[1:06:17] <+chase959> remember if you play alone you lose first 100 matches
[1:06:19] <arkv01> CRANK UP THE SLOW MODE pls
[1:06:19] <%dasmause> game quality varies WILDLY
[1:06:19] <morningmoondude> you might as well stream DBFZ if you're gonna get stomped this bad
[1:06:19] <NotLysander> and the other 3 dont matter
[1:06:20] <Manwad> Paige is best support
[1:06:20] <Zebylth> you can matchmake bots
[1:06:21] <%MaddyCaddy> The first game is bots
[1:06:21] <+MJo367> play against AI to learn
[1:06:21] <WritebroAlpha> For a first game on stream, that actually went really well.
[1:06:22] <InXplotch> @AngriestPat you should try a bots game to get comfortable with unfamiliar characters. it's much harder to learn your character against real players
[1:06:22] <valriot> I THOUGHT IT CRASHED
[1:06:22] <Fancypants25> gg
[1:06:22] <+Pontios> maybe try coop vs ai for starters
[1:06:23] <Goldenwolf98> I mean technically could still be against bots there is a lot of random bots in actual games
[1:06:23] <shiny_prinny> GG
[1:06:25] <The_Hand> @AngriestPat dont feel too bumed out man. it takes like 20 games to get a general idea of the rules and gameplay
[1:06:25] <+DatGuyJimbo> @angriestpat play support to get started
[1:06:27] <filialpails> I'm not familiar with this game, did he win?
[1:06:29] <shinbuya> play vs AI :) ...
[1:06:29] <TeaJayGee> let the salt flow
[1:06:29] <Imsoverylazy> Bots are matchmade man
[1:06:30] <Bigdax> you should play bots
[1:06:31] <%Agami23> maybe try against bots?
[1:06:32] <trueherobappo> gg
[1:06:32] <%Ranryu692> we're saying you should
[1:06:32] <+pocketblue> @AngriestPat you should do a bot game to learn better
[1:06:32] <%Malikial> @AngriestPat You're just learning, dont' get discouraged, really shitty of that dude to stream snipe you though.
[1:06:33] <IminyourBase> yeah but to learn you fool
[1:06:33] <Nina96> are most games this long?
[1:06:34] <$narkonis> you should really play against bots man
[1:06:35] <%ZeroXI> play against ai so you can read all the items
[1:06:36] <DankBurd> Just play Doto smh
[1:06:36] <Jetsfantasy> NotLikeThis
[1:06:36] <TheWashoutXY> Yeah you matchmake for bots too
[1:06:37] <wafflegear> game is over have a look at the shop
[1:06:37] <kajio3033> def play bots
[1:06:39] <nikoloas_> people do bot in this game man
[1:06:39] <shinbuya> play vs AI :) .,.
[1:06:39] <Venchair> it's 5 players versus 5 bots
[1:06:41] <%SoFarFetched> @AngriestPat Think they mean play bots to learn the League stuff.
[1:06:41] <%ImmaCanuck> apatHoldon wait what i just got here why pat play the moba?
[1:06:41] <+enterprise900> You should play against bots
[1:06:42] <Owlboy7> @AngriestPat you should play vs bots at least 1 or twice to learn a character befor pvp
[1:06:43] <BlackermanZX> you kinda got the basics
[1:06:45] <Quietshun13> are you sure tho
[1:06:48] <Skatedeandre> Wait what
[1:06:49] <+Robopengy> So why is Pat playing LoL?
[1:06:50] <ProfBadger> yeah, it's a learning cliff honestly
[1:06:50] <%SvenHolgersson> The real game starts when you get Flash
[1:06:50] <arkv01> play dota, you can win 10 mirrion dollars :)
[1:06:51] <SeleneDemorigan> @angriestpat games in league swing super hard both ways tbh
[1:06:52] <+Xykes> Yeah the learning curve is incredibly steep
[1:06:53] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat We are saying the game put you together with bots like Fortnite. So you feel good.
[1:06:53] <CelioHogane> LOOT BOX
[1:06:55] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat tell Paige to stop being nice to you. It reminds me that I'm stinky and woman hate me. BibleThump
[1:06:55] <Yubul> It's a VERY big learning curve.
[1:06:55] <midnight3> who tho ?
[1:06:57] <%FrogROOT> this game is making my head spin NotLikeThis
[1:06:59] <Sir_Blitz> Bots are really good to practice on to learn the basics, though. Like CSing, buying items, movement, etc.
[1:07:00] <galabuddy> @AngriestPat why don't you get someone to smurf with you just for learnding
[1:07:01] <+Rooknasty1> get garen

[1:07:22] <%Dulzara> Illaoi is very complex for early play.
[1:07:22] <%MaddyCaddy> Garen would be best
[1:07:22] <+Masutasodo> Illaoi is a wooliebait
[1:07:23] <Venchair> Garen is the easiest by far

[1:07:35] <Venchair> Garen is overpowered and very good as a learner champ
[1:07:35] <LoneFonte> ILLAOI IS COOL
[1:07:35] <InXplotch> @AngriestPat Garen is similar to darius, like very very similar
[1:07:37] <+patel347> riven is like a fighting game character with alot of animation cancels but is difficult
[1:07:37] <midnight3> pick garen he is one of the easiest champions in the entire game @AngriestPat

[1:07:42] <%Malikial> @AngriestPat Garen is the second strongest top laner in Current Meta and he is shit easy to play.
[1:07:42] <%ImmaCanuck> she big
[1:07:44] <42nfl19> Garen is very simple to play last I touched the game
[1:07:45] <+MJo367> Garen easiest to learn
[1:07:47] <%ZeroXI> this is a woolie champ haha
[1:07:48] <+patel347> riven is like a fighting game character with alot of animation cancels but is difficult..
[1:07:48] <TheWashoutXY> Don't bother with Illaoi or Riven yet Pat
[1:07:49] <%JonaFett69> ILLAOI IS THE BEST
[1:07:49] <MrMysteryMask> illaoi is like a woolie champ
[1:07:49] <Owlboy7> JUST SEE THE DIFFICULTY, IF IT'S MORE THAN 1 DONT PLAY IT LUL
[1:07:52] <+BubbaRands> She's my aesthetic
[1:07:52] <a_wizard_in_space> Illaoi is super dope.
[1:07:53] <ReDexuz> garen is literally beginner champ
[1:07:53] <%WheatlyXT> tell him to go into his "Collection"
[1:07:53] <Tunykun> Gragas
[1:07:54] <Yubul> @AngriestPat Garen only costs 450 essence, you'll get more value out of the other two.
[1:07:55] <+JrSpore> illaoi is a bit complex
[1:07:57] <+DatGuyJimbo> not illaoi or riven you can't even play darius
[1:07:57] <WritebroAlpha> NOT RIVEN
[1:07:59] <Manwad> Big slap, for big number
[1:07:59] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat she is for woolie
[1:08:00] <shockmaster3> not riven
[1:08:00] <wafflegear> riven or garren
[1:08:00] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat Paige, if your still reading this, that was the third reference I've made to the smash GF controversy, it just makes less sense out of context.
[1:08:01] <bwongdraws> yea there is a star rating for difficulty
[1:08:01] <+cyberpunk998> GAREN IS EASY
[1:08:01] <%WheatlyXT> it's where he can unlock the champs permanently
[1:08:01] <%Tuskor13> @AngriestPat YIu want to pick Illaoi here, RIven has a monumental learning curve and Garen is the cheapest character so getting him for free isn't worth it
[1:08:02] <%TONYOO101> dont do riven
[1:08:03] <CelioHogane> @TheWashoutXY nah man Illaoi is totally fine
[1:08:03] <SharkWolfBlack> NOT RIVEn
[1:08:05] <Moisthoodie> NO RIVEN
[1:08:05] <+patel347> riven is like a fighting game character with alot of animation cancels but is difficult
[1:08:05] <technicalgoose> fuck riven
[1:08:06] <%thesnugglelord> Illaoi is my favorite top laner, but you should get Garen
[1:08:06] <pigliiplays> don't do riven
[1:08:08] <+BIumen> riven is high skill
[1:08:09] <%MaddyCaddy> Riven is do combo so you might not like her
[1:08:09] <Run44forrest> illaoi looks PogChamp
[1:08:09] <%SvenHolgersson> Riven is SCUMMMM
[1:08:09] <bruno_silv0> @angriestpat maybe try Lux thats the character i learned with
[1:08:09] <%SlackerAlex> Riven is Very Hard
[1:08:09] <%immortanjoestar> holy shit dont go riven
[1:08:10] <Imsoverylazy> Garen is OP af rn. Pick him
[1:08:11] <BlackermanZX> RIVEN is pretty technical
[1:08:12] <shockmaster3> she has animation cancels
[1:08:13] <dero45> everybody hates riven
[1:08:13] <@DariusFTL> Yasuooooooooooo
[1:08:14] <%immortanjoestar> for the love of god
[1:08:15] <kajio3033> fuck riven
[1:08:15] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @AngriestPat Riven is like a fighting game character, you want to animation cancel a LOT
[1:08:16] <%Dre_> dont play riven
[1:08:16] <NotLysander> recka
[1:08:17] <InXplotch> @AngriestPat riven is probably the hardest of the 3, illaoi isn't difficult to execute but a bit complicated to understand
[1:08:18] <%SoFarFetched> TAKE THESE BROKEN WINGS AND LEARN TO FLY AGAIN LEARN TO LIVE SO FREEE
[1:08:18] <bakkatohri> You need to understand auto attack resets before you play Riven
[1:08:19] <Yubul> Riven is also FIGHTING GAMEZ
[1:08:19] <Skatedeandre> Riven is very high skill
[1:08:19] <+discouragedoblong> SION
[1:08:20] <%juxtest> Play as Kael'thas
[1:08:21] <+cockburn1994> Not Riven
[1:08:23] <Kalcom> malfurion got it
[1:08:23] <shockmaster3> too tough for new players
[1:08:24] <Daxalog> Riven was built as a "Fighting game character" says riot
[1:08:24] <+patel347> riven is like a fighting game character with alot of animation cancels but is difficult.
[1:08:25] <%Shadowthedigger> Yup Riven is Fight Games
[1:08:25] <ContentNotFound> PogChamp RIVEN
[1:08:25] <%Albadabar> Her Q is a rekka
[1:08:26] <SharkWolfBlack> RIven is hardest champ in game
[1:08:27] <%SvenHolgersson> Riven isn't hard and is such a fucking scumbag champ lol
[1:08:28] <InXplotch> Riven is DO COMBO the character
[1:08:28] <s_snowball> i love riven :)
[1:08:29] <%Dulzara> Riven is high skill cap, but sort of simple for base play.
[1:08:30] <+GeneralHysterics> Riven was designed to play like a fighting game character with animation cancels and combos
[1:08:30] <$Dakuu75> let him pick what he wants, chat
[1:08:32] <42nfl19> SPIN TO WIN
[1:08:34] <%SGrim> DEMACIA
[1:08:34] <CelioHogane> No
[1:08:34] <reiju_22> riven Kreygasm
[1:08:34] <spinbel> PLAY GAREN, IT'S BRAIN DEAD
[1:08:35] <korickdapally> no
[1:08:36] <ashuckel> spinny boys
[1:08:37] <$narkonis> ?
[1:08:38] <+froduck42> no
[1:08:38] <%goose_attack_almanac> Nono that says ability
[1:08:39] <%SashaStarshine> He's based on spell
[1:08:39] <+discouragedoblong> ???
[1:08:40] <TheWashoutXY> @CelioHogane he won't understand how to use the tentacles... rather Riven for the meme of Pat becoming a riven main LUL
[1:08:40] <%Ranryu692> SPIN TO WIN
[1:08:41] <%immortanjoestar> lmao ranged
[1:08:41] <Top_Lane_Duelist> BIG NUMBER SWORd
[1:08:41] <technicalgoose> melee
[1:08:43] <ReDexuz> ABILITY POWER NO RANGED
[1:08:44] <%SvenHolgersson> No Pat thats wrong
[1:08:44] <Yubul> Riven is in fact, DO COMBO
[1:08:45] <+Vascune> thats not what that bar means
[1:08:45] <%Shadowthedigger> Garen is the Mario to Darius's Wario
[1:08:45] <The_Hand> rivens aoe stuns so the the idea is to use your melle attacks to get close then stun and wack them
[1:08:45] <cydonis137> spin to win!
[1:08:50] <+discouragedoblong> Def not ranged
[1:08:50] <%Malikial> @AngriestPat That means his damage is based on his abilities, not ranged.
[1:08:51] <Imsoverylazy> YES GAREN IS SUPER RANGED
[1:08:52] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat a blind man can play Garen well. Go Garen.
[1:08:53] <+HalloKeyori111> Garen is the rival to darius
[1:08:53] <%WheatlyXT> Garen is the easiest of the three (and rival of Darius)
[1:08:54] <TheWashoutXY> Simple and Neat
[1:08:55] <bakkatohri> Cho'gath is really fun to play. You remember Spawn? Remember Violator??
[1:08:56] <Manwad> That's ability damage to autoattack damage, not melee to ranged
[1:08:57] <+mutavault666> no mana so only have to deal with cooldown
[1:08:59] <CelioHogane> @TheWashoutXY it's not that hard to learn, and it's the kind of thing he would like
[1:09:02] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat garen is very new palyer friendly
[1:09:03] <%ZeroXI> spin to win
[1:09:03] <%lewd_sister_of_battle> lewd_sister_of_battle subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:09:05] <technicalgoose> S P I N
[1:09:06] <@DariusFTL> Garen's got got a skill set that's standard across a few Mobas too, so you know he's a solid pick
[1:09:06] <reonome> spin2win
[1:09:07] <%skizzuto> spin to win
[1:09:07] <avocadosandwitch> @AngriestPat Ask pat what he played on HOTS maybe chat can give him suggestions on what champs to look out for
[1:09:07] <%Ranryu692> YEYEYE SPIN TO WIN
[1:09:09] <InXplotch> @AngriestPat that bar represents if they do spell damage or auto attack damage more. garen's spells are his main form of damage and they do physical damage
[1:09:09] <TheyCallMeVawn> BEYBLADE
[1:09:10] <BlackermanZX> SPIN 2 WIN

[1:09:19] <Jontman42> Garen's basically the easiest tank
[1:09:19] <Yubul> Yeah, Sonya is a good parallel.
[1:09:20] <%galaxyswirl> SPIN TO WIN
[1:09:20] <+Pontios> DEMACIA

[1:09:21] <+patel347> riven is like a fighting game character with alot of animation cancels but is difficult..
[1:09:21] <%lewd_sister_of_battle> Did Pat loose a bet or something?
[1:09:21] <%trustycoyote> He's a very straightforward champ and easy to use

[1:09:21] <UnfilteredComic> Q, E, R

[1:12:12] <dero45> dont show until in game
[1:12:13] <TheWashoutXY> Pat go for a co-op ai game
[1:12:15] <trueherobappo> Mute and hide it
[1:12:15] <theKingRamses> hide until champ select

[1:12:39] <%SvenHolgersson> Always hide that minimap
[1:12:45] <+RenoDeGeneric> So the problem be you are gonna run into Snipers, and just general smurfs
[1:12:49] <TheWashoutXY> Play vs AI
[1:12:50] <%Takreth> top 15
[1:12:51] <Supervyxen> OH NO
[1:12:52] <%WheatlyXT> I want to help win for you
[1:12:54] <Imsoverylazy> Imagine not being the most popular game ever. This message brought to you by the LoL gang
[1:12:54] <technicalgoose> fuck those snipers
[1:12:55] <%Sephirios> thats the life of a top 20 streamer :P
[1:12:57] <InXplotch> The minimap is barely relevant
[1:12:57] <%SvenHolgersson> Doesn't matter what level you are they WILL snipe
[1:12:59] <DeadpoolSama> Does it allow you to co-op vs AI? That helped me when I was a beginner back in the day.
[1:12:59] <$narkonis> @AngriestPat i feel like if you want to give this game an honest shot someone you know should be here to coach you along. But if not then you're not going to have a very good go about it.
[1:13:00] <+mccf> cant pat put his face on the minimap? so he can still see it?
[1:13:02] <+glgzephyr> @AngriestPat Has anyone told you yet that you'd probably love Top lane considering it belongs to tanks and bruisers?

[1:13:08] <ReDexuz> why hide minimap?
[1:13:09] <OToole42> @AngriestPat I wouldn't worry about winrates in normals, it's just tekken practice mode against people. Take your time to learn what you like, the meta picks and top tiers don't matter until Plat/diamond

[1:13:27] <Finchit> You gotta get good. So you gotta get it good
[1:13:27] <%yasahiro1011> THAT'S WHA HAPPEN
[1:13:27] <ProfBadger> Look, if you're on the other team, he gotta do you like that.
[1:13:28] <%bevyrage> i'm working on a layout for you to use right now @AngriestPat as a heads-up
[1:13:28] <+MrPashesh> Yo don’t be frustrated, you’re doing way better than me my first few games of league. Built the most random shit with champs I thought were carries but were not

[1:13:30] <shockmaster3> you wanted the toxicity though
[1:13:32] <+Rewrench> hiding mini map is more to not show your allies. its not hard to see where Pat is from rest of screen
[1:13:33] <@DariusFTL> He's not just gonna throw because you're on the other team. Gotta have principles.
[1:13:33] <MrMysteryMask> this scumbag wheatly
[1:13:34] <BlackermanZX> Play against bots to get the hang of it
[1:13:34] <Skatedeandre> Wheatley that’s wintraded
[1:13:35] <Yubul> Pat, you should play versus AI for a little bit so you can learn the game's basics. There's a lot to learn in just the basic mechanics of the game, let alone specific combos for champions.
[1:13:36] <Spawntaneous501> don't play with the furry again
[1:13:38] <Imsoverylazy> I have never been more tempted to make an alt in another region than right now just to fuck with Pat
[1:13:38] <CptTeempo> ipavO blotChamp
[1:13:39] <Manwad> Smurfs, na. You get matched at your own level, while smurfs get a boost to their games. If a smurf is with you that means they suck

[1:13:58] <suikudo> If you wanted to get into league you should have learned the game BEFORE streaming it
[1:14:01] <Run44forrest> cthulu speak?
[1:14:04] <%WheatlyXT> Just because I'm against you doesn't mean I can let you win

[1:14:18] <Jarvanii> these low level unranked blind matches are so bad no one usually streams them but it's fine for learning
[1:14:18] <TheWashoutXY> SPIN TO WIIIN
[1:14:18] <ProfBadger> yeah Garen is almost certainly easier to plan around
[1:14:21] <Yubul> Garen is definitely easier to pick up than Darius.
[1:14:21] <%terribleusername> spin to win
[1:14:21] <+glgzephyr> garen is perfect for him
[1:14:23] <%dasmause> SPEEEEEEEEEN
[1:14:23] <VritraReiRei> @WheatlyXT going to be quite honest, you were playing quite rudely to someone who played only his SECOND GAME
[1:14:24] <$narkonis> @AngriestPat the easiest role to learn imho is adc, you just go pew pew pew
[1:14:29] <IminyourBase> i am taking big dmg
[1:14:31] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat garen is simple, big tank that just smites things
[1:14:34] <Fujiwara_92> was chat here toxic enough
[1:14:36] <Jontman42> Garen is one of the champions I started with
[1:14:38] <CptTeempo> danH
[1:14:39] <ThirdPersonPhil> @AngriestPat can you change the map position and just put under your facecam?
[1:14:39] <datmouse> woah pat league stream monkaS
[1:14:40] <%immortanjoestar> 1 tip for garen. hide in brusg
[1:14:41] <$Dakuu75> this stream is a dot on my soul, and i love it
[1:14:43] <Skatedeandre> I’m taking TONS OF DAMAGE
[1:14:44] <%gogozeppli> @narkonis why are you lying lol
[1:14:46] <Jayfox82> Just don’t snipe guys
[1:14:48] <ProfBadger> So the big piece of advice I'd give is that you should pick an ability and max it first.
[1:14:50] <%gogozeppli> top is the easiest
[1:14:50] <BigManLugan> @PeachSaliva if pat plays in-house games he should be able to try learning the game with people who wont be total dicks
[1:14:55] <Run44forrest> pat asked for the toxic Kappa
[1:15:02] <$narkonis> @gogozeppli adc is ResidentSleeper
[1:15:06] <+FrenchTact1cs> Wanna learn last hitting? Play Nasus
[1:15:09] <Finchit> @AngriestPat holy shit you got a kill in your first game. god damn you good kid
[1:15:10] <ProfBadger> like, you unlock all your skills, but put points into only one to start.
[1:15:12] <%Sephirios> Fokus on ONLY hitting minions for last hits, unless you need to push out the lane or the opponent isn't in the lane so you can push your minins to the tower
[1:15:15] <Jontman42> Items are just stats and passive or active effects
[1:15:17] <%SvenHolgersson> Skins are the only thing that will affect appearance
[1:15:22] <Skatedeandre> Not even for Darius most ever champ you wanna focus on farming
[1:15:23] <$narkonis> @gogozeppli i mean, top at a higher level is hard imho but i guess it doesn't matter
[1:15:27] <%SvenHolgersson> effect? whatever words are dumb
[1:15:33] <Yung_FckUp> oh no why would he do this
[1:15:34] <PumpAction> Pog LoL stream.
[1:15:35] <Manwad> We in it
[1:15:36] <%gogozeppli> bot gets ganked too often and have to many variables
[1:15:39] <+HelloImTom08> how did the league game go, did he win?
[1:15:40] <bahamut1010> pat playing LOL WTF??
[1:15:41] <InXplotch> Practicing and learning last hitting for gold is a central feature of every role but support
[1:15:42] <%sectorquack> get them counterpicks in
[1:15:44] <%WheatlyXT> lmao

[1:16:02] <%vixenpunch> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 I just tweeted at you a visual help guide for the shop, my profile picture should be some ducks
[1:16:02] <%WritebroAlpha> Hey!
[1:16:02] <+cyberpunk998> @AngriestPat The ideal is you go top, last hit as many minions as possible, and buy items when your health or mana is low in the base. Then when youre stronger, fight the enemy
[1:16:03] <+Saylit> need a game to kill the long weekend with some one inhere sell me on warframe
[1:16:06] <datmouse> good luck pat
[1:16:08] <%ImmaCanuck> VIKTOR MrDestructoid
[1:16:08] <%gogozeppli> top is an island for the most part

[1:16:32] <%Malikial> @AngriestPat It's better to level one ability to max. Like on Garen you ant to take your q first, then e then w, then max level e, then q, then w. Take R when it's available at level 6-11-16.

[1:18:59] <Vinniesaurus> send that Sona bottom lane
[1:19:00] <a_wizard_in_space> that's a passive from the person near you.
[1:19:00] <TurtlesAndTentacles> You know Paige is right Pat @PeachSaliva @AngriestPat

[1:19:08] <@Mechz71> @PeachSaliva Paige you don't understand. If he keeps reading chat and not focusing on the game he has a built in John when he starts losing

[1:19:12] <%Shadowthedigger> That heal shuts off when you take damage
[1:19:13] <%hawk_rush> sona top zfgNoDude
[1:19:14] <+patel347> no jgl in low elo
[1:19:14] <ProfBadger> yes, in gneeral you want to get all your abilities once then max a single ability.
[1:19:15] <Imsoverylazy> Tell Sona to go bot
[1:19:16] <Jontman42> It's fine the Sona doesn't know better
[1:19:16] <%Dulzara> Low level, likely no jg.
[1:19:16] <%goose_attack_almanac> No Jungler. It's is third game
[1:19:17] <InXplotch> there are no jungler players this game
[1:19:18] <ThirdPersonPhil> sona is going top xD
[1:19:18] <Venchair> you can't do 1-1-2 until people have smite
[1:19:18] <Tunykun> Ctrl + 3 to dance Pat. Not troll
[1:19:19] <critfumble_> get the ruuuuunnes wait wrong game
[1:19:21] <%SashaStarshine> @AngriestPat The regen only works outside of combat though
[1:19:22] <%Malikial> @PeachSaliva Tell Garen is Q cleanses all slows so if someone casts a slow on him he can cast it to move max speed again.
[1:19:23] <+HyperCharge_Sam> guys people don't know the META in these games calm down
[1:19:23] <theKingRamses> bot already has 2 it looks like tho
[1:19:24] <%goose_attack_almanac> Its good for him that she is there
[1:19:24] <Manwad> Guys there's no jungler, he's in the megaearly stage of playing where smite isn't even unlocked yet.
[1:19:24] <+patel347> theres no smite low level guys
[1:19:24] <VritraReiRei> @discouragedoblong what do you mean wrong pot, there's literally only one kind he can afford with 50g
[1:19:25] <OToole42> @AngriestPat your Q is also a speed boost, so it helps for chase as well as disengage
[1:19:25] <$Dakuu75> So, top is suppose to be solo lane, btw pat
[1:19:25] <Jayfox82> Idk why Sona is top but she’s probably new
[1:19:27] <%MaddyCaddy> Viktor ded
[1:19:27] <Jarvanii> pat you have a pocket healer in this match
[1:19:28] <+HalloKeyori111> Chat needs to realize that pre lvl 30 games wont follow the meta lol
[1:19:29] <Skatedeandre> Oh my god I forgot you have to unlock smite
[1:19:29] <%FrogROOT> ok
[1:19:29] <Zlinnt> LOL

[1:19:32] <TheWashoutXY> LUL
[1:19:32] <+GeneralHysterics> Paige is super right, you gotta pay attention to the game. League has enough down time (like when you die) that you'll still be able to catch a glimpse.
[1:19:32] <%Malikial> @PeachSaliva Tell Pat I mean.
[1:19:34] <+seaearthandsky> WHAT!?
[1:19:34] <Supervyxen> Pat's feeling it now

[1:20:11] <RipHina> pog last hitting
[1:20:12] <lvl10cybermancer> Big tip, basically if you're not sure where to go, stay in your lane until either your tower falls or theirs does, then go wherever your teammates are bunching up
[1:20:12] <%vixenpunch> @ProfBadger urgot is a top laner?
[1:20:12] <%SvenHolgersson> Try not to auto attack so much later on

[1:20:27] <shiny_prinny> @AngriestPat garen does not use mana, which is great for beginners
[1:20:28] <lomack42> he's learning
[1:20:29] <Yubul> Q resets your auto swing, just like Darius' W
[1:20:30] <Venchair> smite is locked behind account level 9 so pats going to be stuck with duo lanes for a long time

[1:20:31] <Supervyxen> yo he's actually doing good
[1:20:31] <+PBJammy> I like this, 2 top laners
[1:20:31] <The_Hand> 2v1 top actually puts you at a disadvantage because it splits the exp bewtween the 2 of you @AngriestPat

[1:20:45] <+PBJammy> and trist bot alone :(
[1:20:45] <VirtuaRailith> You gotta play Garen as a big bully, always hit that fucker with your q when it's up unless he's under turret
[1:20:46] <%Malikial> @AngriestPat Your Q is an auto attack reset so if you cast it the MOMENT your auto attack does damage it will immediately attack a second time, cancelling the animation.
[1:20:48] <bruno_silv0> is pat playing support?
[1:20:49] <xanner420> hes using a abilites on the wave pog
[1:20:49] <bakkatohri> You can level up abilities by using ctrl + (Q/W/E/R)

[1:20:57] <Venchair> becaise tjat
[1:20:58] <Manwad> Wait a lil bit.
[1:20:59] <redrins> that's how the game works
[1:20:59] <Zlinnt> LUL aww
[1:20:59] <Nina96> this seems like its going well
[1:20:59] <%hawk_rush> sona taking the last hits lol
[1:20:59] <%MaddyCaddy> They aggro if you hit champs
[1:21:00] <Bigdax> thats how it works
[1:21:00] <TheWashoutXY> Press F
[1:21:01] <ProfBadger> Minion aggro is part of thegame
[1:21:01] <+HyperCharge_Sam> if you attack champions under their turret, the turret will attack you
[1:21:02] <xanner420> minion agro
[1:21:02] <pitsuji> F PAT
[1:21:02] <+patel347> if you hit them miions agro on you
[1:21:03] <%wujak> thats how the game works
[1:21:03] <@JustinianKnight> thats how it works
[1:21:03] <%gogozeppli> minion aggro
[1:21:03] <blaggablag> Their bot must be getting fucked then
[1:21:03] <NotLysander> Minons agro
[1:21:04] <+GeneralHysterics> garen passive op
[1:21:05] <%vixenpunch> Minions like to hit you if you hit someone on their team
[1:21:05] <%SvenHolgersson> Gotta respect the tower range bubba
[1:21:05] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat That is how minion aggro works. They defend the hero
[1:21:06] <%chronotriggerhappy123> because minions are programmed to attack you if you attack their hero
[1:21:06] <%ZeroXI> go back
[1:21:08] <technicalgoose> they agro to you when you hit an enemy
[1:21:08] <%Malikial> If you attack a champion it draws aggro from all minions and towers within 800 range.
[1:21:08] <+chase959> sona has been taking ur farm seems like
[1:21:09] <+CarissMcbober> The tower and all creeps will target you as soon as you target an enemy player.
[1:21:10] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat Abilities don't trigger minions, autoattacks do
[1:21:12] <dmtjinni> Hi, Pat
[1:21:13] <InXplotch> @AngriestPat the game has a mechanic where if you attack a champ the minions will attack you to defend them.
[1:21:14] <gensoukaizou> this is a marvel
[1:21:14] <+patel347> minion agro on you if you hit them its part of game
[1:21:14] <%gogozeppli> theyre defending their laner
[1:21:15] <ContentNotFound> PogChamp Still Alive
[1:21:16] <lvl10cybermancer> DON'T FIGHT UNDER TOWER
[1:21:16] <+GeneralHysterics> NOT THAT OP
[1:21:16] <simulationbard> Minions will attack you if you attack an allied champ around them
[1:21:17] <GKannel> oof
[1:21:17] <$TheSmerdis> Being carful to not walk under the turret is VERY important

[1:21:28] <%Piemen99> this looks boring as hell
[1:21:28] <gensoukaizou> LUL
[1:21:28] <Venchair> some abilities do trigger aggro
[1:21:29] <%gogozeppli> ablities do trigger
[1:21:30] <Jontman42> Talking about autoattack canceling seems a bit too advanced when he's getting used to autoattacking
[1:21:30] <Finchit> Bruh dont hit people under tower. you die fast
[1:21:30] <alrobot2014> is there no tower line indicator?
[1:21:32] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat They aggro if you attacktheir hero
[1:21:32] <%vixenpunch> boots!
[1:21:34] <NotLysander> Dont fight under their tower, be patient and wait for them to come out
[1:21:35] <%Agami23> pat does know that the tower focuses him if he attacks an enemy champion, right??
[1:21:35] <OToole42> Abilities trigger minions wtf chat
[1:21:35] <%Taisuru> If you right click the enemy, minion get mad
[1:21:36] <+chase959> if you hit the enemy the enemy minions will hit you
[1:21:36] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Minions will immediately target you if you hit an enemy champion with a Basic Attack.
[1:21:36] <jeosadn> and single target abilities do trigger minon agro now
[1:21:36] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat dont get to close to turret, they attack you if you hit a champ or if there are no minions to shoot
[1:21:37] <Imsoverylazy> boots
[1:21:38] <tri3dgE027> rooD Do my eyes deceive me? Pat is dipping his shoes into a MOBA?!
[1:21:39] <%Albadabar> Tower will hurt you if you're smacking enemies underneath it
[1:21:39] <$narkonis> @AngriestPat atacking champions in tower range will get tower aggro, towers will instagib you

[1:21:40] <tacostarvedbeast> Oh no
[1:21:40] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Paige is TOXIC
[1:21:40] <%Shadowthedigger> @AngriestPat if you hit another player, the nearby minions hit you cause you're killing their boss.
[1:21:40] <shiny_prinny> 2
[1:21:41] <+NobuuNobuu> Some skills do trigger minions
[1:21:41] <Tunykun> Hi Paige. We appreciate you reading the chat :)
[1:21:41] <@DariusFTL> coming in outta HotS doesn't prepare you for how much more dangerous the towers in League are.
[1:21:43] <VritraReiRei> that's wrong, abilities AND auto attacks trigger minions!
[1:21:43] <xanner420> if you auto them close to their minions, they whoop yo ass
[1:21:44] <seycheles> D:
[1:21:44] <suikudo> these fucking 2
[1:21:44] <%gogozeppli> single target abilites do
[1:21:45] <xxafrodragonxx> Kappa
[1:21:46] <%WritebroAlpha> If an enemy minion sees you attack an enemy champion, they aggro onto you, but abilities don't draw aggro
[1:21:47] <%Takreth> hitting the enemy causes the minions to hit you instead
[1:21:47] <Spawntaneous501> pat if you walk past your minions you get attacked
[1:21:47] <%Madbearv> apatPorgmo
[1:21:47] <%Alpha8087> PAIGE TALK TO US D:
[1:21:48] <Nexoosen> hitting a champion makes the minions aggro you, they do a hefty amount of damage in the early game
[1:21:48] <$Dakuu75> <3 <3 3
[1:21:50] <MessyBristles> so when you are under tower if you hit an enemy thenturret willnauto target you
[1:21:50] <+seaearthandsky> paige shut up LUL
[1:21:50] <bruno_silv0> never jump on the towerthis early
[1:21:52] <+crackheadcontrol> Minions aggro against people who hurt their champion friends while in range
[1:21:52] <+mccf> DAD MOM NO
[1:21:53] <%TaifuDragon> When you hit somebody with your right click it will make minions focus on you. When you hit someone with QWER they will keep aggro on what they are aggro. @AngriestPat
[1:21:53] <Jarvanii> streaming this might be a terrible idea since people can just make new accounts to snipe you
[1:21:53] <+FadingEmber> Pat is playing League ?!
[1:21:53] <@JustinianKnight> yea Hots Towers are a joke
[1:21:54] <%BeefyQueefer> paige am become toxic chat
[1:21:54] <%topendbuzz> pagie is TOXIC
[1:21:55] <Yubul> Minions will defend champions if they get hit by basic attacks or single-target abilities.
[1:21:55] <Jontman42> Why is Paige more upset than Pat
[1:21:55] <%SvenHolgersson> Paigey Poo tell Patrick to MAX E
[1:21:56] <%greatbalwaagh> PAIGE being TOXIC

[1:22:02] <BlackermanZX> @AngriestPat If you are in turret range and hit someone you get turret shot'd
[1:22:02] <reonome> ! TOXIC !
[1:22:02] <DracaenaLeaf> Pat didn't say that
[1:22:02] <Venchair> Abilities do draw aggro now it's been the case for a while stop spreading misinformation
[1:22:03] <+Dr_Mooose> Paige read us
[1:22:03] <tacostarvedbeast> Tell pat he’s a handsome boy
[1:22:08] <InXplotch> @AngriestPat Additionally you should try a beginner bot game. it draws big circles around the towers to show you when you're safe or in danger of the enemy structures
[1:22:09] <lvl10cybermancer> Tower is OP as hell, don't fight under enemy tower early game
[1:22:11] <+cyberpunk998> @AngriestPat Enemy minions attack you when you auto attack the enemy but not when you cast abilities to deal damage
[1:22:13] <%truesleepking> WHAT IS HAPPENING PATS PLAYING LEAGUE????
[1:22:13] <Tunykun> Tell him to drop his shield
[1:22:14] <%Takreth> level up e

[1:22:16] <Fujiwara_92> 2
[1:22:17] <%NWR_James> is this how Pat turns into a moba nerd?
[1:22:18] <%Dulzara> You're both doing great.
[1:22:19] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Yeah Pat was being a big meanie @AngriestPat @PeachSaliva
[1:22:20] <%Takreth> and wpin on them
[1:22:21] <Bonbie> Read us give our lives value
[1:22:21] <+GeneralHysterics> Oh rive, wants to die
[1:22:22] <The_Hand> @AngriestPat turret will target your minions if they are in range, BUT the turert will switch to targetting you if you attack the enemy and are in range of the turret.
[1:22:23] <ReDexuz> spin them to death
[1:22:24] <datmouse> hit them with your kill move PogChamp
[1:22:24] <Tarviti> If you hit a champion under the tower it auto targets you for big damage

[1:22:35] <+Emperor_Bad> hit him
[1:22:35] <OToole42> @AngriestPat any aggression towards enemy characters triggers minion aggro, and vice versa, so its wise to start trading blows after killing off the wave, or kiting the enemy into your minions

[1:22:56] <ShineTheDiamond> Lol
[1:22:56] <%WritebroAlpha> You can animation cancel your attack with your Q
[1:22:57] <%lotharrio> Paige is a LoL-pro.
[1:22:59] <finetunedregalia> welp

[1:23:02] <%sectorquack> cant wait to hear about this one on next weeks podcast
[1:23:06] <+GeneralHysterics> This is like watching two boomers try to fix their computer via IT (the chat)
[1:23:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> how dare you coach Pat, Paige...how DARE you.
[1:23:09] <@StridentSong> @ShockzNDrawe I even put it in Slow mode. It's helped a little at least
[1:23:12] <vinrugo> Paige is the real diamond 4
[1:23:15] <%truesleepking> I... wana play with pat now
[1:23:15] <%SvenHolgersson> If you attack champs the tower focuses you
[1:23:15] <kakdela7> is this the outlanders update?
[1:23:16] <+chase959> if you hit enemey enemy minions will hit you
[1:23:20] <%thepeoplezoo> Are you having FUN Patrick!?
[1:23:24] <+NobuuNobuu> VIK WTF LUL
[1:23:25] <The_Hand> @AngriestPat turret will target your minions if they are in range, BUT the turert will switch to targetting you if you attack the enemy and are in range of the turret.
[1:23:25] <$Dakuu75> minions get mad when their teammate is attacked
[1:23:26] <Tunykun> Why are there 3 people now. hahahahha
[1:23:26] <+Zxtole> Minions will attack anyone in range if you auto an enemy champ, but they won't on ability casts
[1:23:27] <theKingRamses> hitting an enemy champ triggers nearby npc aggro
[1:23:27] <blaggablag> I like this elite Paige support
[1:23:27] <%Malikial> @AngriestPat If you hit ctrl+q w e r you can learn the abilities without clicking them.
[1:23:27] <%SvenHolgersson> The more a tower hits you the harder it hurts
[1:23:27] <%arfsm95> WHAT IS THIS
[1:23:29] <tri3dgE027> I could argue that maxing Q 1st is the the best-choice than E, but meh this is just a newbie game LUL
[1:23:30] <WolfHavocX> jaboodyLurk
[1:23:30] <%SashaStarshine> @PeachSaliva If the enemy minions see Pat hitting their player they'll punch him
[1:23:30] <+HyperCharge_Sam> that's the most complicated way of saying that
[1:23:32] <Tarviti> If you hit the player all the minions agro on you
[1:23:33] <%KevinsLunchbox> dont stand around the enemy minions and attack the enemy champion.
[1:23:33] <VritraReiRei> Guys, he isn't going to understand any of the advice you give him if you make it so complicated! It's just his third game LUL
[1:23:33] <@StridentSong> It's at 10 seconds, I think we can kick it up to 20 if it gets really bad
[1:23:36] <gensoukaizou> now there's 3 top
[1:23:38] <Jetsfantasy> They defend the champion
[1:23:39] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat it means if you attack a minion, other minions attack it. So aim for the last hit.
[1:23:39] <+CarissMcbober> If you target players the creeps will all start hitting you.
[1:23:39] <@commanderclaw> No, hitting other players
[1:23:40] <%WritebroAlpha> Oh, that's just bad luck
[1:23:41] <Jontman42> hitting enemy champions causes minions to hit you if they're close
[1:23:41] <%chronotriggerhappy123> because they target low health
[1:23:41] <@JustinianKnight> because you hit the champ
[1:23:42] <reonome> you were hitting a hero pat
[1:23:42] <%vixenpunch> not minions
[1:23:43] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Attacking Champions with a Basic Attack or Your Q Triggers AGRO on all minions onto you
[1:23:44] <UnfilteredComic> Bad luck
[1:23:45] <datmouse> that's literally just bad luck
[1:23:46] <tacostarvedbeast> Tell pat to imagine he is a beyblade
[1:23:47] <robodisney> lol, mid
[1:23:47] <%KevinsLunchbox> enemy minions will target you when your minions have all died
[1:23:48] <Owlboy7> LOSE THE KILL TO MINIONS LUL
[1:23:48] <%Tuskor13> Because the minions are rat bastards
[1:23:49] <+chase959> turret dmg
[1:23:49] <%Albadabar> It;s enemy player characters
[1:23:50] <%SvenHolgersson> PAT THE TOWERRRR
[1:23:51] <+GeneralHysterics> Towers chew you up
[1:23:51] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Tower hits hard
[1:23:52] <NotLysander> Dont fight under their turret
[1:23:52] <%Shadowthedigger> Watch out for the tower Pat
[1:23:52] <+mccf> don't get close to tower pat
[1:23:52] <%Agami23> if you attack an enemy champion, minions and towers will hit you
[1:23:53] <suikudo> You cannot tower dive
[1:23:53] <Rand004> thats how it be sometime
[1:23:53] <ProfBadger> Sequential Tower Shots hurt really bad!
[1:23:54] <prime_name> So is the lore for League any good? Or is it just fluff?
[1:23:54] <bakkatohri> Having more than one person in top lane isn't meta, because you're sharing gold and XP at the moment.
[1:23:54] <+BiggestBuckets> you eat that tower way too much
[1:23:55] <theKingRamses> the tower doesn't like how close you are
[1:23:56] <shiny_prinny> @AngriestPat minions just attack the closest enemy
[1:23:57] <pitsuji> SOMEONE EXPLAIN THE TOWER
[1:23:58] <$narkonis> @PeachSaliva if pat attacks champions in tower range the tower will start attacking him and it does HUGE damage he should avoid it at all times, theres a sound to notify when hes about to be attacked.
[1:24:01] <+Sochin_Iitsu> Kill the minion better nerd
[1:24:01] <%gogozeppli> minions killing the enemy still give you the kill
[1:24:03] <alrobot2014> why isn't there a visible tower line?
[1:24:03] <+silvery_cricket> Attack the boss and the adds swarm you
[1:24:04] <TheWashoutXY> You Hit enemy champion, enemy minions start hitting YOU
[1:24:05] <metalwater8> How many times has pat lost so far?
[1:24:06] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Pat, don't fight under Tower, it will kill you
[1:24:06] <ProfBadger> try to avoid getting hit multiple times by the tower!
[1:24:06] <%lotharrio> Oh Pat's the swordsman? I thought he was the floaty mage.
[1:24:06] <lvl10cybermancer> Last hitting takes a lot of practice to get good at, once you've been playing for a little bit there's kind of a flow to it that you get a feel for
[1:24:07] <ReDexuz> he understands tower
[1:24:07] <Imsoverylazy> If you use your Q on somebody it prevents them from using their abilities for a bit @AngriestPat
[1:24:08] <%SashaStarshine> @PeachSalive tell
[1:24:08] <InXplotch> @AngriestPat Stand behind your minions as best you can and do not hit enemy champions near their tower.
[1:24:08] <%Aztec50> the minions hitting other minions is somewhat random
[1:24:09] <%NWR_James> Has Pat been toxic yet?
[1:24:09] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat If you hit a champion with QWER, minions will keep doing what they're doing. When you hit them with right click, it makes minions aggro. Towers will attack you no matter what
[1:24:10] <suikudo> If you go under an enemy tower before it targets your ally minion you will take a huge amount of damage
[1:24:15] <+Jp3g95> Pat's playing leaGUE WHAT THE FUCK??
[1:24:15] <%yasahiro1011> THE TOWER HAS RANGE PAT
[1:24:19] <%SvenHolgersson> If there are no minions near it, the tower goes for champs
[1:24:19] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @prime_name like a twinkie, its all fluff and filler.
[1:24:21] <Dovakhin573> is it me or there used to be a radius telling the range of the tower
[1:24:22] <Jontman42> If you go close to the tower when it isn't attacking minions, it will attack you
[1:24:22] <%gogozeppli> if you play bots they outline the towers range
[1:24:22] <+silvery_cricket> Do not farm under the enemy tower
[1:24:22] <Manwad> @prime_name The lore's rad, they got Graham McNeill on the writing staff
[1:24:23] <%WritebroAlpha> If you do any damage to an enemy champion when you're in range of the tower, the tower will target you
[1:24:24] <%yasahiro1011> YOU ENTER THAT RANGE WITHOUT A MINION, THE TOWER TARGETS YOU
[1:24:24] <UnfilteredComic> You still have 600 gold pat
[1:24:27] <Tomikozi> Are you dinguses explaining minion wave control before summoner spells, towers, and how lanes work?
[1:24:27] <The_Hand> teh TOWER is that big thing
[1:24:28] <%hawk_rush> pat needs to watch a YouTube vid on this, he can't keep up with chat advice
[1:24:29] <Kongro_> Tyler1 really let himself go huh
[1:24:31] <%SashaStarshine> @PeachSaliva It is important for Pat to plug his stream in all chat ingame
[1:24:33] <Jontman42> If you attack an enemy champion under the tower, it will attack you
[1:24:34] <$TheSmerdis> Or if you damage an enemy while under it it targets you
[1:24:35] <Jarvanii> isn't there a tutorial for towers and shit?
[1:24:36] <tri3dgE027> @AngriestPat Using Q makes you move faster as long as you toggle it
[1:24:36] <jastrouble97> Pat you played hots it's not that different
[1:24:39] <+chase959> the parts tho
[1:24:39] <kazadog> you could buy the components
[1:24:39] <+BIumen> buy PARTS of the items
[1:24:39] <vinrugo> Every shot past the first from a tower does more damage
[1:24:41] <a_wizard_in_space> Hey Pat when you get a chance drop your ward in the bush nearest your lane in the river. You're about at the point in the game where their jungler will gank you and that will give you visibility down there.
[1:24:42] <datmouse> man this chat is full of so much useful information all at once LUL
[1:24:43] <@JustinianKnight> you should play the tutorial mode at least one
[1:24:43] <+DatGuyJimbo> pat did you even play the tutorial this is basic shit
[1:24:44] <simulationbard> You can buy components to
[1:24:44] <+HyperCharge_Sam> if you attack enemy champions underneath their tower, it will target YOU
[1:24:48] <TheWashoutXY> TRIST PogChamp
[1:24:49] <%yasahiro1011> PAT, Cheaper items ARE components of ITEM
[1:24:49] <+chase959> you can buy the parts
[1:24:49] <%dasmause> your trist is carrying
[1:24:49] <+zinris> remember the components are cheaper
[1:24:52] <triphdog420> @kongro_ LULW
[1:24:52] <@PeachSaliva> @kongro_ Huh???
[1:24:52] <%ShogunNoonto> tower have big number do not stand by it to long
[1:24:52] <BlackermanZX> He is gettin' it
[1:24:53] <%greatbalwaagh> Tower will target you if no minions are around, or If you are attacking an enemy champ
[1:24:55] <%Aztec50> you generally want to stay behind your minions
[1:24:55] <bakkatohri> The enemy tower's damage will get stronger with each shot.
[1:24:56] <$narkonis> @JustinianKnight pat doing tutorial LUL
[1:24:56] <%ImmaCanuck> Bot lane gonna carry pat to a win
[1:24:56] <%truesleepking> @AngriestPat are you playing with fans I would love to hop in a call and play or give pointers I have been playing for 10 years
[1:24:57] <BeNiceImShy> I wish I still liked league
[1:24:58] <%SvenHolgersson> Thats why you dont wanna auto attack the entire lane cuz THEN you lose out on potential last hits
[1:24:59] <%Agami23> if you play with bots, it shows you the towers range
[1:24:59] <The_Hand> league needs a better tutorial
[1:24:59] <Jontman42> This is why having a person coach would be soooo much more effective than the whole chat lol
[1:25:00] <+Rooknasty1> nice
[1:25:03] <Skatedeandre> There’s too much info coming in at once
[1:25:05] <Tunykun> Spin2win pat thats all you need to do
[1:25:05] <%Malikial> The parts of Phage are 400 and 350 gold respectively, you should buy the ruby crystal when you go back. It gives you 150 bonus hp.
[1:25:06] <ReDexuz> GANKED
[1:25:06] <ProfBadger> Also the Q will silence enemies
[1:25:06] <%NovaKnightmare> ok Im very late to stream I have to ask: why?
[1:25:07] <blaggablag> The point of massing minions is that you get enough fodder to redirect tower aggro while you do your thing. If you hit enemy heros the tower redirects to you
[1:25:08] <%WritebroAlpha> Buy components for Phage when you go back next
[1:25:10] <%hawk_rush> Ganked oh no zfgNoDude
[1:25:10] <VritraReiRei> @PeachSaliva when pat is close to a tower it will target him if none of his minions are near. it makes a little chime when you are being targetted by the tower. It does a lot of damage
[1:25:11] <suikudo> If you go underneath an enemy tower it should be for one of two reasons to attack the tower directly or to fight an enemy champion
[1:25:12] <+GeneralHysterics> BIG QIYANA ULT
[1:25:13] <%Pontios> rather then not buy the full item, buying it's sup-parts is well worth it for the stats they provide
[1:25:14] <lvl10cybermancer> Jebaited
[1:25:16] <tacostarvedbeast> U need more shirts bro
[1:25:17] <ProfBadger> I forgot about that\
[1:25:17] <+InEzrealwetrust> he do the big damage
[1:25:23] <%gogozeppli> the more people in your lane the less exp you get
[1:25:25] <Tarviti> That also means your tower is much safer
[1:25:27] <bruno_silv0> gotta pop them wards
[1:25:28] <+silvery_cricket> A smart strategy if you arent confident in your skills in a fight, is to try and bait them in attack you close to your tower. That way it will target them if they hit you
[1:25:28] <Ser_Ser_Ser> didnt even realize they had a qiyana
[1:25:30] <%gogozeppli> it's split 3 ways
[1:25:32] <Venchair> Don't forget about your summoner spells on D and F
[1:25:37] <TheWashoutXY> press F
[1:25:37] <datmouse> F FeelsBadMan
[1:25:40] <%SvenHolgersson> The tower also does more damage the more it hits you
[1:25:42] <BlackermanZX> Press F to use your second special summoner skill @AngriestPat its a heal in this case
[1:25:43] <Jarvanii> it would be much easier to understand if he did a tutorial
[1:25:43] <%gogozeppli> so thats why urgot is a higher level
[1:25:45] <%boxofhooligans> Using Q after an Auto Attack will reset animation in another "Auto Attack" @angriestpat W is shield when fighting.
[1:25:46] <%sectorquack> F
[1:25:46] <dmtjinni> Pat PLAYING LoL??! He really fell off......
[1:25:50] <chidere> Are rune pages still a thing?
[1:25:50] <+GeneralHysterics> BIG HEAL PLAYS
[1:25:51] <Tarviti> F is heal D is speed buff
[1:25:51] <reonome> f
[1:25:52] <@JustinianKnight> Speed Boost and Heal
[1:25:53] <RipHina> F
[1:25:53] <%terminallyCapriciousz> F
[1:25:53] <+ygernesfeld> F
[1:25:55] <NotLysander> @PeachSaliva Please tell him to think like Warcraft 3. The towers have an agro range. if you go under it first, it shoots you. Also Minions will attack other minions if they exist. When all of yours are gone their minions will attack you. Or if you hit the enemy they change agro to you
[1:25:55] <Skatedeandre> Who’s buying qiyana at level 5?
[1:25:56] <%twistingt0rt0ise> f
[1:25:56] <r90thunder> @peachsaliva the practice tool allows you to test out all this stuff, including tower range. It's very useful for learning the basic mechanics
[1:25:57] <redrins> His q makes him run faster while active
[1:25:57] <%SGrim> Three top with zero mid? Okay then, hopefully that works
[1:26:01] <+torvicus96> F

[1:26:04] <reonome> LUL
[1:26:05] <bakkatohri> Use ghost to chase people when they're low on health
[1:26:07] <stoccton> LUL
[1:26:07] <Snookasaurus> this IS pretty pathetic lol
[1:26:09] <IminyourBase> @AngriestPat garen is hard to get kills before you get your ult. the ult is the finish to your combo
[1:26:10] <Jarvanii> what LUL
[1:26:11] <Tunykun> that urgot. amazing.
[1:26:12] <+GeneralHysterics> Yo urgot, is outta control
[1:26:12] <@JustinianKnight> what a flash
[1:26:13] <%ImmaCanuck> WASTED FLASH LUL
[1:26:13] <ContentNotFound> LUL
[1:26:14] <Lucasleonava> Press F to live
[1:26:15] <Jetsfantasy> @Skatedeandre Smurfs, one tricks, and new players
[1:26:15] <Quite_Dapper> INCREDIBLE URGOT GAMEPLAY
[1:26:17] <a_wizard_in_space> oh man that Urgot dive
[1:26:18] <BlackermanZX> Urgot top is disgusting
[1:26:18] <+Jp3g95> Oh man this takes me back to when i was learning to play league
[1:26:19] <Tomikozi> ;v;
[1:26:21] <UnfilteredComic> stay in lane, your passive is healing you
[1:26:22] <ForgetfulUthanasiast> I have literally never seen this game before
[1:26:29] <%SashaStarshine> @PeachSaliva Listening to chat might not be the best idea if only because trying to do too many different things at once will make it hard to learn things naturally
[1:26:31] <Quite_Dapper> He should back and reset for an item
[1:26:33] <%sectorquack> do not challenge urgot
[1:26:33] <%yasahiro1011> PAT WHY ARE YOU GOING IN
[1:26:33] <Skatedeandre> Wait what that dude has flash?
[1:26:34] <%yasahiro1011> DONT GO IN
[1:26:36] <TheWashoutXY> Press B to teleport back to base @AngriestPat
[1:26:37] <ReDexuz> you are doing fine, actually
[1:26:38] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat garens auto heal lets him stay in lane longer
[1:26:40] <%Malikial> @PeachSaliva Tell Pat his q cleanses all slows and makes him run faster for a second so you can use it to facilitate escaping.
[1:26:41] <+HyperCharge_Sam> go B and get items
[1:26:42] <datmouse> self preservation is your most important skill while starting LUL
[1:26:42] <%Taisuru> I hate Qiyana
[1:26:42] <Quite_Dapper> now that all of his team has died
[1:26:44] <Tarviti> Garen relys on his Ult to kill so don't go too hard until you get it
[1:26:44] <+silvery_cricket> Garens Q has a silence, so its strong to start your fights with that since it stops them from using their abilities for 1 second.
[1:26:44] <ProfBadger> flash is level 10
[1:26:46] <bwongdraws> get more items at 1200 gold
[1:26:48] <a_wizard_in_space> Pat you should play very defensively right now.
[1:26:49] <%Takreth> just wait before you hit them
[1:26:49] <InXplotch> @AngriestPat stand behind your tower and then press B
[1:26:50] <BlackermanZX> Yeah it takes time to learn the last hit
[1:26:50] <redrins> assists are good too
[1:26:51] <Jontman42> It takes a while to get used to last hitting
[1:26:51] <blaggablag> Yeah you gotta hold back that killing blow man
[1:26:51] <Ids560> Pat remember to never stop going in
[1:26:52] <%Takreth> try to get the last hit
[1:26:52] <%President_Miyazaki> It's better to wait for them to be near death and then just get the last hit.
[1:26:53] <%Dulzara> Last hitting is hard even for long term players.
[1:26:53] <%hawk_rush> the struggle that is getting CC
[1:26:54] <lvl10cybermancer> You just need to practice to get good at last hitting
[1:26:54] <UnfilteredComic> theres a pattern, it takes some time to learn
[1:26:55] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Pat why?
[1:26:55] <Jarvanii> have to time it better
[1:26:55] <xanner420> kill them with q
[1:26:56] <ProfBadger> 0/2 is fine.
[1:26:57] <@commanderclaw> Last hitting takes a good while to get used to, you're doing fine for a newbie
[1:26:58] <Arrior_Septem> ganked
[1:26:59] <%terribleusername> it's FINE
[1:27:01] <Dovakhin573> Yeah last hitting takes a bit to get down
[1:27:01] <%trustycoyote> Pat is already doing LEAGUES better this round. Eh? Get it? EEhhhhh?!
[1:27:02] <%WritebroAlpha> When farming under tower, melee minions take two tower shots then you hit them; casters you hit once, then tower shot, then you hit again
[1:27:04] <%Reevesypoo> Tell pat to just have fun, it will all come with time he is going okay!
[1:27:04] <Ser_Ser_Ser> besides qiyana who's just, qiyana
[1:27:06] <xanner420> farming with q is easy
[1:27:06] <$Dakuu75> it's fine, it's fine
[1:27:07] <NotLysander> Last hitting is a really hard skill to learn. It takes a lot of practice
[1:27:08] <shiny_prinny> @AngriestPat timing for last hits takes a while to learn
[1:27:09] <%greatbalwaagh> first item, maybe consider a phage or some armor and health
[1:27:10] <a_wizard_in_space> You're doing well!
[1:27:10] <shockmaster3> you will learn the timeing
[1:27:11] <Tennochief> nani the fucku?
[1:27:11] <%boxofhooligans> OUTPLAYeD
[1:27:12] <Dovakhin573> is not supposed to be easy
[1:27:12] <BlackermanZX> you're doing super fine actualy
[1:27:15] <ProfBadger> yeah, it's a 'mechanics' thing, like doing combo
[1:27:16] <reonome> GODLIKE
[1:27:18] <RipHina> youre doing great its your third game lol
[1:27:18] <Jetsfantasy> You're doing fine, but you really should be doing bot games to learn the game before worrying about PvP
[1:27:20] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat Try to avoid attacking minions until you can shear off the last pixel for last hits.
[1:27:20] <ReDexuz> double click to buy
[1:27:21] <IminyourBase> @AngriestPat it's hard for garen to get kills before he has his ult. the ult is the finisher
[1:27:22] <%galaxyswirl> chat, you think he should build into warmogs?
[1:27:22] <%cureneckbeard> rampaige
[1:27:22] <arkv01> almost gottem, just got ganked
[1:27:23] <leeroy418> DEMACIAAAAAAAAAAAA
[1:27:23] <+chase959> to last hit under turret you let the tower hit the melee minions twice then mage minons once
[1:27:23] <UnfilteredComic> Trist is going to carry you dont worry
[1:27:24] <tacostarvedbeast> Let ranger minions take 1 tower hit then hit them
[1:27:24] <+Rooknasty1> he's learning pog
[1:27:25] <ThirdPersonPhil> always check bushes or ward them
[1:27:26] <pitsuji> you can just buy it directly if you have the money
[1:27:27] <InXplotch> @AngriestPat dont worry about last hitting. as you play you will get a better understanding of when to attack to get the kill for gold.
[1:27:29] <datmouse> you can do it pat PogChamp
[1:27:30] <TheWashoutXY> Very good
[1:27:31] <Faultlined> Spam Q to get back to lane faster Pat
[1:27:31] <%ImmaCanuck> Jebaited
[1:27:32] <%SvenHolgersson> You did WAYYYY better than i did
[1:27:32] <+Radiantomega> also use 4 to place an item that gives vision in fog
[1:27:36] <ThirdPersonPhil> you have 2 wards
[1:27:37] <The_Hand> @AngriestPat your minions will attack the first minions in the row they see. its genrally a good idea to watch what minions your minons target first and try to last hit that one.
[1:27:38] <@DariusFTL> You really gotta fight like a coward until you know you're good to go. You're doing fine
[1:27:38] <UnfilteredComic> read your q ability
[1:27:39] <GKannel> DOUBLE CLICK ITEM TO BUY
[1:27:39] <Venchair> yeah pat really just needs to get the fundamentals down
[1:27:41] <@JustinianKnight> you're in the right lane this time
[1:27:41] <+Jp3g95> He is learning what he can and can't do chat, he is new. relax
[1:27:43] <TheWashoutXY> Garen helps too
[1:27:43] <%WritebroAlpha> You are doing noticeably better on an individual level
[1:27:43] <vinrugo> The real gam starts when you find the champ that makes it all click
[1:27:43] <blaggablag> Last hitting with melee heroes is fucked, I hate it.
[1:27:44] <King_Wulgard> @AngriestPat you can double click on an item to buy it instantly
[1:27:46] <Fujiwara_92> you can do it Pat
[1:27:47] <Manwad> They're also new
[1:27:49] <Quite_Dapper> The good old triple top meta
[1:27:49] <%Dulzara> That Urgot is definitely trying hard, and he has Flash, so he's higher level than you by far.
[1:27:49] <%SvenHolgersson> Your Q is also a silence
[1:27:50] <VritraReiRei> Don't worry pat, your team will carry you if dont do so hot!
[1:27:52] <NeoRageX456> he learned to use B instead of walking, that's improvement
[1:27:53] <lvl10cybermancer> It takes a while to get used to but there is kind of a rythm to the damage your creep wave does to the enemy creep wave, you've got to just hit at the right time to get the last hit
[1:27:53] <galabuddy> the best lesson is that your teammates are cannon fodder
[1:27:54] <ProfBadger> A quick tip: melee minions will take 2 tower shots and be killable by a single attack. Unless they've taken other damage.
[1:27:55] <+silvery_cricket> The ring around Urgot (The green one on spider legs) is his special ability if he attacks you while part the ring facing you is green. It will deal extra damage to you.
[1:27:55] <%SvenHolgersson> On the first hit
[1:27:55] <%WritebroAlpha> Also, you can right click an item in shop to buy it
[1:27:56] <+chase959> to last hit under turret you let the tower hit the melee minions twice then mage minons once frostpMEGAGUN frostpMEGAGUN
[1:27:56] <BlackermanZX> It takes time to learn the last hit
[1:27:56] <%Taisuru> Gotta get the timing down
[1:27:57] <%Malikial> @AngriestPat The tower is geared so it kills Melee Minions in 3 attacks. After 2 it is one auto from any champion to farm the minion. So if there is a full hp minion running to your tower, do not hit it until the tower hits it twice.
[1:27:57] <Venchair> right clicking an item also purchases it quickly
[1:27:58] <Finchit> Idk how we can help pat. Just throwing out random advice aint helping. bruh needs a helper/coach
[1:27:58] <$Dakuu75> this is literally Tutorial-rank, guys
[1:27:59] <%Explodincatz> its stupid
[1:28:00] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Why you no learn from Dunkey
[1:28:01] <tacostarvedbeast> Tell pat I’m faker
[1:28:02] <ThirdPersonPhil> who the fuck is mid?
[1:28:04] <%Faustgesicht> no mid?
[1:28:04] <+NobuuNobuu> Why is there no one mid?
[1:28:07] <+CloudsBringRain> One valuable skill to learn is learning how to let your teammates carry you, so you're not doing too bad
[1:28:07] <arkv01> ur doing great honey! NOW GET THE FUCK IN THERE AND RAMPAGE
[1:28:07] <friendlyjoker312> ABOUT TOWERS! Each consecutive hit deals more damange, so tell Pat to get out of there after he is hit by the first one ABOUT ITEMS! Tell pat to try to use as much of his gold as he can by buying the small recomended items
[1:28:07] <%boxofhooligans> Q is an Auto Attack reset, it is essentially a hit confirm pat. @angriestpat
[1:28:08] <Tennochief> you gotta time it well
[1:28:08] <+torvicus96> don't forget to always try and split the lanes so you have to share less xp amongst champions
[1:28:09] <simulationbard> Last hitting is a skill you have to learne, or just play support like me
[1:28:09] <pigliiplays> last hitting is definitely a thing that takes time to get a feel for
[1:28:09] <BluBox> Last hitting takes some getting used to
[1:28:09] <@JustinianKnight> thats something that you just have to get used to
[1:28:10] <$narkonis> ayyyyyyyy

[1:28:51] <%SashaStarshine> @Peachsalive matchmaking is a bit fucky in the first 10 or so games on an account, Pat is playing against 3 people that are obvious secondary accounts but those will get weeded out eventually
[1:28:52] <reonome> NO PAIGE NO
[1:28:52] <+AnxiousLogan> I believe in you Pat!!!!!
[1:28:52] <%trustycoyote> Savage!
[1:28:53] <InXplotch> @AngriestPat 600. 300 per kill if that enemy hasn't been feeding
[1:28:53] <%kyh9> Garen is unique for the fact that he doesn’t use any mana. So cooldown reduction is all you have to care about really
[1:28:53] <Jontman42> Garen's fun eh?
[1:28:53] <%DrFacilier> PAT IS GOD
[1:28:53] <%Comtrya> DUO

[1:28:57] <%Malikial> @AngriestPat No bullshit, garen is the second strongest Top laner in LoL right now.
[1:28:57] <ThirdPersonPhil> Keep and eye on the map if a enemy champion that should be on a lane is not there he might be coming to your lane
[1:28:58] <%riantDeliration> oh no
[1:28:58] <CelioHogane> Paige play yes
[1:28:59] <Finchit> riven might be a bot account, but you doing good
[1:28:59] <Ids560> Last-hitting in Dota can be hilariously awful depending on the character

[1:29:15] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat Paige, Simulstream with Pat and then snipe his game, this game will run on ANYTHING
[1:29:16] <%ImmaCanuck> PunOko
[1:29:16] <ProfBadger> I think league takes some time to work out in theory and practise.
[1:29:18] <+GeneralHysterics> The puffer fish face tho

[1:29:20] <%SvenHolgersson> Paige would do great with Teemo
[1:29:20] <InXplotch> I wanna see paige play adc and pat play support for her
[1:29:22] <%goose_attack_almanac> @PeachSaliva If you did I'm sure you'd let people coach you through it easier than a mob yelling at people
[1:29:23] <%yasahiro1011> @AngriestPat play casual games with paige in team and subscribers, different each match?
[1:29:25] <%Taisuru> Hehe
[1:29:25] <Fujiwara_92> PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
[1:29:28] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Paige has Pufferface in the bedroom
[1:29:29] <%SashaStarshine> @PeachSaliva The matchmaking is fucking Pat over right now, he's playing against 2 people that are obvious secondary accounts for people that already know what they are doing
[1:29:29] <tacostarvedbeast> It’s hard on ur wrists Paige
[1:29:30] <blaggablag> Good warding
[1:29:30] <Ris_Eltrut> rip bot
[1:29:31] <+BIumen> look at him warding
[1:29:31] <Skatedeandre> Nah this game would fuck Paige’s wrist up
[1:29:31] <%lotharrio> Used to play DotA when it was a Warcraft 3 map. That was fun.
[1:29:32] <UnfilteredComic> Remember you have a shield on w
[1:29:33] <bleugh> nyannDab
[1:29:33] <ReDexuz> wards in bush
[1:29:35] <TheWashoutXY> Press B to teleport back to base @AngriestPat
[1:29:35] <+CrystalTree07> @AngriestPat you can use Q on the tower for bonus damage
[1:29:36] <Imsoverylazy> Use Q to deal more dmg to tower and reset auto attack animation to attack faster
[1:29:37] <%SvenHolgersson> Time to buy!
[1:29:37] <@DariusFTL> go buy yourself a treat at the store for doing the good murder
[1:29:41] <%NWR_James> Paige is being toxic chat in person
[1:29:41] <%kyh9> Big dick Garen
[1:29:46] <Spawntaneous501> oh boy legendary poopy
[1:29:47] <ProfBadger> Intersting fact: If you do a beginner bot game, they show tower ranges. Which can be helpful to figure outrange.
[1:29:48] <Tennochief> I prefer DOTA and SMITE because they have options to get everyone forever
[1:29:48] <blaggablag> Wait for that minion train
[1:29:50] <%greatbalwaagh> Paige's next stream should be her Streamsniping pat
[1:29:50] <Quite_Dapper> You should think of last hitting like keeping track of multiple timers. The closer you get to the reaction time of clicking on the minion just before they die the better you will get at consistently getting the gold reward.
[1:29:50] <BlackermanZX> RUUUN
[1:29:52] <lvl10cybermancer> It's usually best to put wards in bushes so the enemy team can't hide in them
[1:29:52] <%einheri> tfw Pat has more viewers than some League streamers I have been following for 8 years
[1:29:53] <UnfilteredComic> HEAL
[1:29:54] <+silvery_cricket> If you put the ward in bushes it reveals whats inside the bush while the ward is up, so its good to put your wards there.
[1:29:55] <FrostyKaze> place your wards in bushes Pat
[1:29:55] <leeroy418> yaaaaaaa
[1:29:55] <pitsuji> Thats a ward it just gives vision on the map
[1:29:56] <ThirdPersonPhil> The damage that the tower does to you increase with each hit
[1:29:57] <%Dulzara> NICE heal
[1:29:58] <@ShockzNDrawe> I unironically think paige would be good at this game
[1:30:00] <$narkonis> this sona is keepin pat alive
[1:30:01] <%furiousfurioso> furiousfurioso subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! woo a year apatDab
[1:30:02] <%Aztec50> yes it is hard on your wrists
[1:30:02] <ReDexuz> if you put wards in bush it makes them invisible to the enemy

[1:30:25] <+chase959> @AngriestPat to last hit under tower let it hit the melee minons once and the mage minons twice
[1:30:30] <%pectusumbra> wait WHAT
[1:30:31] <%GalacticLatte> You can do it in the UI menu dude
[1:30:34] <+Rooknasty1> pat is doing really good on garen

[1:31:03] <bakkatohri> A hint about resistances: Armor only makes your current health more effective. It will never completely negate damage, which is why you need more health.
[1:31:03] <dmtjinni> Paige with the hot tips
[1:31:04] <+theballad_tft> if you press q while you are spinning from you e you move faster
[1:31:06] <BlackermanZX> 4/2/0 Actually better than most newbies LUL

[1:31:10] <@JustinianKnight> justin92YouDidIt
[1:31:10] <UnfilteredComic> Q THEN R
[1:31:10] <Imsoverylazy> Tip for Garen, use Q to engage, then E once they're silenced
[1:31:11] <$narkonis> awwww ult would have killed
[1:31:11] <+ChiefWilly> He IS canadian, 4/2/0 is appropriate
[1:31:14] <ProfBadger> okay, so you need to worry about shutdowns: Killstreaks increase the gold you get for killing the killstreaking person

[1:31:15] <%Aztec50> Raid boss Pat begin NOW
[1:31:15] <ashuckel> should've stayed in pat
[1:31:15] <simulationbard> He's like 15
[1:31:16] <+AnxiousLogan> Q gives you movespeed to gapclose, and after you hit it use E to spin, finally R to execute
[1:31:17] <%pectusumbra> okay chat help me how long has this been going on?
[1:31:18] <Venchair> if you hold control and hit Q W E or R to level up a skill without needing to click

[1:31:44] <%a_wizard_in_space> a_wizard_in_space subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:31:44] <ashuckel> @AngriestPat you need to let the health drop lower to use your Ultimate
[1:31:45] <lvl10cybermancer> It was worth it because now your teammates can take the tower
[1:31:45] <blaggablag> Good trade dude
[1:31:45] <%cureneckbeard> coke milk
[1:31:46] <datmouse> it doesn't matter if it was worth you have to say it is every time
[1:31:47] <%SvenHolgersson> If you can get the kill 100% if worth
[1:31:47] <+ChiefWilly> objectively no, in my opinion absolutely
[1:31:49] <ProfBadger> well they got the shutdown gold
[1:31:49] <go4thekneez> thats not worth at all he shut him down and got gold
[1:31:49] <Jarvanii> kayn is a fucking smurf for sure

[1:32:01] <$narkonis> thats why hes one of the easier ones
[1:32:02] <%lotharrio> Pat appears to be the 14th or 15th biggest LoL streamer.
[1:32:03] <Skatedeandre> That kayn is 100% a smurf
[1:32:03] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, he's newbie mode
[1:32:04] <Tunykun> yeah thats hwy garen is beginner champ. just can spam skills

[1:32:07] <%pectusumbra> and yeah.
[1:32:07] <%KevinsLunchbox> garen doesnt use mana, just bear in mind his ability cooldowns
[1:32:08] <%topendbuzz> to dumb for mana
[1:32:09] <%sectorquack> i miss tyler1

[1:32:10] <+chase959> pat wouldn't cry at worlds
[1:32:12] <triphdog420> @angriestpat it wasn't worth u gave them shutdown gold
[1:32:12] <+swaggopotamus> Garen is very beginner friendly.
[1:32:12] <%MaddyCaddy> Burger king foot lettuce
[1:32:13] <+NobuuNobuu> @AngriestPat It doesn't matter if it's worth or not you always says it was worth to piss off your enemoes
[1:32:14] <Sacksquatch> nope, purely cooldown based
[1:32:16] <%UltraViolet371> What a weird game. I can't tell if it's a fun to play. Is it a fun to play?
[1:32:16] <Jetsfantasy> Garen is a great beginner char because he has no mana
[1:32:16] <ThirdPersonPhil> keep in mind that when you die last people that damaged you gets the kill so the guy you killed also killed you

[1:32:28] <%MaddyCaddy> No way
[1:32:29] <%SvenHolgersson> Be sure to ward bushes for better coverage @AngriestPat
[1:32:29] <Jontman42> Not at all
[1:32:29] <pigliiplays> only in height baby
[1:32:30] <$narkonis> LOL wait what?
[1:32:30] <@JustinianKnight> nice
[1:32:30] <%MaddyCaddy> Not at all
[1:32:30] <stoccton> LUL
[1:32:30] <sosandstorm> That's awful advice, last hitting is the first thing you should focus on learning how to do right, that way if anything else goes wrong you know you'll at least be getting that amount of gold
[1:32:31] <%goose_attack_almanac> NOOOO
[1:32:31] <%Dre_> LOL
[1:32:31] <Fancypants25> Hey pay you should try going mid that way you get more minions and experience for being alone
[1:32:31] <go4thekneez> LUL
[1:32:31] <Jetsfantasy> That Kayn knows his shit
[1:32:32] <$Mothman742> @peachsaliva u are cool and strong peachy
[1:32:32] <UnfilteredComic> NOOO PAIGE
[1:32:33] <lvl10cybermancer> Big tip, basically if you're not sure where to go, stay in your lane until either your tower falls or theirs does, then go wherever your teammates are bunching up
[1:32:33] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> did hell freeze over? why is Pat playing LOL?
[1:32:33] <%pectusumbra> and oh, this is a real game too, amazing!
[1:32:33] <%FrogROOT> youre both short and bald
[1:32:33] <Tunykun> Pat looking like Tyler1? hahahahahahaa
[1:32:34] <%Dulzara> REAL Kayn
[1:32:34] <BluBox> Tyler1 is a clown for sure
[1:32:35] <KattyCitty> pat is buffer than t1
[1:32:35] <IminyourBase> YOU'RE THE SAME HEIGHT LOL
[1:32:36] <%SashaStarshine> @AngriestPat Matchmaking is kinda fucked for the first 10 games or so, in this game i see 3 people that have a grasp on how to play the game but they'll get weeded out of your games eventually
[1:32:37] <Syvar> LUL
[1:32:38] <TheWashoutXY> T1 BABYYY
[1:32:38] <ReDexuz> you kinda look like tyler1
[1:32:38] <%trustycoyote> Oh totally
[1:32:38] <+Dr_Mooose> your handsomer
[1:32:39] <+ChiefWilly> good play actually, saving the Q silence
[1:32:40] <+ygernesfeld> @AngriestPat Garen is gated by cooldowns, so items that give cooldown reduction are very good on him.
[1:32:40] <%greatbalwaagh> Tyler is a huge cringe lord
[1:32:40] <TwinBat> similar height
[1:32:40] <%truesleepking> Cheer100 are you doing fan games I have been playing for 10 years and would love to give some pointers
[1:32:40] <ProfBadger> I mean... they're both kinda short
[1:32:41] <%Malikial> @AngriestPat Tyler1 is a big meathead but eh's short.
[1:32:42] <%Dre_> hes about the same hight as tyler LUL
[1:32:42] <TheBasicEvil> Tyler1 looks like a thumb.
[1:32:42] <tacostarvedbeast> @angriestpat any chance pat will wanna play fun modes with chat?
[1:32:44] <SubjectX07x> Tyler1 looks like Tommy Pickles from the rugrats.
[1:32:45] <Imsoverylazy> Kayn is the EDGE champion
[1:32:46] <+crackheadcontrol> If you think that looks like illidan, check out dota and anti mage
[1:32:47] <+silvery_cricket> thats Kayn he is a high skill jungler
[1:32:48] <%WritebroAlpha> Garen's ultimate is an execute; it does more damage if the enemy is on lower health
[1:32:48] <OToole42> @AngriestPat your ultimate ability (R) can execute when you see a yellow blade icon above the enemy champion
[1:32:48] <IminyourBase> YOU'RE BOTH THE SAME HEIGHT
[1:32:49] <InXplotch> his name is Kayn
[1:32:49] <%MaddyCaddy> He's kind of a man child
[1:32:50] <Tunykun> No Tyler1 is a high level LoL player as well as YouTuber
[1:32:50] <arkv01> big widdle babbby!
[1:32:50] <TheWashoutXY> SAME HEIGHT LUL
[1:32:50] <@JustinianKnight> new scythe dude
[1:32:50] <Skatedeandre> T1 is the meme streamer for league
[1:32:50] <%snow_bush> I thought it was Maive
[1:32:51] <ProfBadger> The champion is named kayn, yes.
[1:32:51] <%galaxyswirl> WINION!
[1:32:52] <Faultlined> You can use q to auto reset pat

[1:32:54] <Manwad> yes
[1:32:55] <shiny_prinny> yes
[1:32:55] <Jetsfantasy> Yes, that's his passive
[1:32:55] <BlackermanZX> Yup
[1:32:57] <%SvenHolgersson> Yup thats your passive
[1:32:57] <KattyCitty> Garen passive
[1:32:58] <+swaggopotamus> Garen passive gives him boosted healing.
[1:32:58] <UnfilteredComic> From champs, minion damage is fine
[1:33:00] <Ids560> no pat it's a ripoff of a ripoff of illidain
[1:33:01] <theKingRamses> if you don't take damage from champs
[1:33:02] <Fancypants25> damn
[1:33:03] <%MoraMiarty> tyler1 looks like a peanut
[1:33:03] <%Verd_254> q tower
[1:33:03] <LionheartMD> Tyler1 is the actual face of LoL on twitch
[1:33:04] <+Rooknasty1> it heals more the more you level
[1:33:04] <+GeneralHysterics> Yeah, he's part of cirque du soleil
[1:33:04] <Tarviti> pay attention to enemy levels if they're bigger than you it's risky to fight them alone
[1:33:06] <Imsoverylazy> q tower
[1:33:06] <ReDexuz> Q to tower
[1:33:06] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @AngriestPat You can Q on towers for big damage
[1:33:06] <+theballad_tft> you can use your q ability on the tower btw
[1:33:07] <BlackermanZX> Keep hittin'
[1:33:08] <UnfilteredComic> Q on turrets
[1:33:09] <Jetsfantasy> He heals % health when not in combat
[1:33:09] <%mostundesired> LUL
[1:33:10] <%galaxyswirl> use q on turret, does more damage
[1:33:10] <%a_wizard_in_space> Yup you have huge passive healing.
[1:33:11] <%SvenHolgersson> heh
[1:33:11] <%Taisuru> Use q on the tower
[1:33:13] <Haarute> you can q the tower since it empowers an autoattack
[1:33:13] <ashuckel> use your Q on towers
[1:33:14] <KattyCitty> finish off the tower!
[1:33:15] <dmtjinni> LUUUUL
[1:33:17] <%RayDaug> Tyler1 looks like a homunculus
[1:33:18] <IminyourBase> just...kill the tower
[1:33:19] <%ImmaCanuck> sandbaged LUL
[1:33:19] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> someone please answer me, why is Pat playing league?
[1:33:19] <+HyperCharge_Sam> get tower pat
[1:33:22] <SuperCreeperBlocks> Garen PogChamp
[1:33:23] <+GeneralHysterics> smack the tower
[1:33:23] <blaggablag> Take the shot
[1:33:24] <%greatbalwaagh> Tyler doesn't have a beard, so a point in your favor pat
[1:33:26] <%torvicus96> you can use your q on towers to do more damage
[1:33:26] <+AnxiousLogan> Q works on towers
[1:33:27] <%FrogROOT> hes funny
[1:33:27] <%pectusumbra> between this and 9+ hour dota 2 purge patch video it's the season of the Moba
[1:33:28] <Swish19XX> What the fuck, why am I downloading LoL and Dota 2
[1:33:28] <InXplotch> you did it!
[1:33:29] <antthefool> Now kith
[1:33:30] <+ygernesfeld> @AngriestPat The "+18.1" is your health regeneration rate. When you're out of combat it is much higher than normal.
[1:33:30] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Garen's Passive gets sstronger overtime. I believe you can view the details by mousing over the Passive Icon and pressing C
[1:33:30] <IminyourBase> this stream is causing me so much damage
[1:33:30] <Tunykun> Clap
[1:33:31] <Supervyxen> yo that dodge

[1:33:34] <MrMysteryMask> @AngriestPat q turret for more damage on it
[1:33:34] <%Taisuru> Tell pat that Q works on towers
[1:33:34] <%WritebroAlpha> PAIGE TELL HIM HE CAN ANIMATION CANCEL HIS AUTO ATTACK WITH Q
[1:33:35] <%a_wizard_in_space> He's doing it!!!!
[1:33:36] <%SashaStarshine> Why are we talking about Tyler1?
[1:33:37] <Skatedeandre> @raydaug LUL I see what you did there
[1:33:37] <Faultlined> You can use q to auto reset Pat
[1:33:37] <%sectorquack> look it up

[1:33:38] <pitsuji> hard dodges

[1:33:45] <Cymen90> BigBrother
[1:33:45] <%SvenHolgersson> Your Q is also an auto attack resetter meaning you can hit them with 2 quick attacks
[1:33:45] <shiny_prinny> twitch mostly
[1:33:46] <InXplotch> twitch primarily
[1:33:47] <redrins> who's taller, t1 or pat
[1:33:49] <theKingRamses> champ damage cancels your passive autoheal

[1:33:55] <%RayDaug> @Skatedeandre thank you
[1:33:55] <Guyshane> Urgod
[1:33:56] <+silvery_cricket> Garens Passive is if he takes no damage from champs or tower for a certain amount of time, he will regenerate part of his health every few seconds, Minions damage does not stop the healing
[1:33:56] <%Ranryu692> I tried to get into my account that I haven't touched in years, only to find out I was hacked and permabanned

[1:34:15] <ashuckel> @AngriestPat it's battle damage, aka enemy players and big jungle monsters, minions don't deactivate your regen
[1:34:17] <%MaddyCaddy> Honor your jungler
[1:34:17] <@ShockzNDrawe> I always played Ashe because she was the tutorial champion. When I would have no idea what I'm doing I would just lunch her ult randomly into jungle and occasionally hit people from spawn
[1:34:18] <%Goobbue> So did anything special happen with LoL or is Pat streaming it just because
[1:34:18] <bwongdraws> max Q
[1:34:19] <Venchair> if you hold control and hit Q W E or R you level up a skill without needing to click
[1:34:20] <TheVoltStrike> i didn't know pat played this game
[1:34:20] <Jetsfantasy> He was a piece of shit but has gotten better and unbanned now. Was a big controversy
[1:34:21] <UnfilteredComic> You q on the tower
[1:34:21] <%kyh9> Urgot the prettiest magical girl
[1:34:22] <%StaceMcGate> feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme
[1:34:25] <%WritebroAlpha> @Dakuu75 he got it last game with Darius's W
[1:34:25] <Finchit> MAX an ability before doing others
[1:34:26] <arkv01> like coming from HotS, LoL is a lot slower cause of the farming
[1:34:27] <+Deko_> i love those wards lol
[1:34:27] <Flickerember> @AngriestPat forgive if already had your daily dose of backseat leaguing but Q is an auto reset. I dont have good example but other than using q to run around big fast can use it to one-two combo
[1:34:28] <Owlboy7> @AngriestPat the more people in a lane the less exp you get
[1:34:28] <+katarjin> .......The FUCK is this SHIT? LoL?
[1:34:28] <bwongdraws> also you are getting the hang of it
[1:34:28] <+Rooknasty1> Normally it would only be you in top lane.
[1:34:28] <datmouse> LUL right outside the bush
[1:34:30] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> LUL that ward
[1:34:30] <%SvenHolgersson> WARD BUSHES
[1:34:30] <NotLysander> Put those wards inside the bush
[1:34:32] <ShadeTheNovice> LUL
[1:34:32] <+silvery_cricket> Tyler 1 is hyper toxic and rages easily whenever he isnt losing, so he is often banned from the game for periods of time
[1:34:33] <ReDexuz> WARDS ON BUSH MAKES THEM INVISIBLE
[1:34:33] <friendlyjoker312> KEEP THE SPACEBAR PRESSED
[1:34:34] <%wujak> the ward need to be in the bush to see into it
[1:34:34] <%Malikial> @AngriestPat Max level your e before you level up q. E does so much more damage each time you level it.
[1:34:35] <blaggablag> [spin to win intesifies]
[1:34:35] <%yasahiro1011> LUL
[1:34:35] <BlackermanZX> You put the wad on the bush actually @AngriestPat
[1:34:35] <MrMysteryMask> this is a much better game
[1:34:36] <+BoboDaHobo> BoboDaHobo subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[1:34:37] <+AnxiousLogan> if you don't know where to ward, a bush is good bet!
[1:34:37] <%yasahiro1011> THAT WARD
[1:34:39] <Vinniesaurus> place those wards in bushes
[1:34:40] <Tarviti> Pat, your Ult can instakill if the enemy is below a certain percent health so save it for then
[1:34:41] <IminyourBase> NA WARDS
[1:34:42] <arkv01> thats why Pat is weirded out by farming minions
[1:34:43] <Imsoverylazy> Nice Ward LUL
[1:34:43] <lvl10cybermancer> It's better to put the wards into the bushes so that you can see enemies trying to hide in them by the way
[1:34:45] <+CrystalTree07> @AngriestPat ideally use the ward in the bushes
[1:34:45] <ShadeTheNovice> Wards in bushes are more useful
[1:34:46] <%coffeeabomination> Ward Inside bushes for better coverage
[1:34:47] <UnfilteredComic> no
[1:34:47] <simulationbard> He was super toxic so he got banned indefinitely, he's since calmed down apparently and got unbanned
[1:34:48] <%Chichen> its not.
[1:34:50] <+GeneralHysterics> Max level for non ults is five
[1:34:50] <Tunykun> Stop talking about T1. Just help pat lol
[1:34:50] <FrostyKaze> Pat put the wards in the buches
[1:34:50] <trueherobappo> i regret saying what i said.. im gonna lose my car at this rate.
[1:34:50] <TheVoltStrike> no you can put one more point in it
[1:34:51] <%terminallyCapriciousz> One more point for your E pat
[1:34:51] <+0range_> RUUN
[1:34:51] <%SvenHolgersson> 5 levels for each skill
[1:34:51] <+chase959> no it has five lvls
[1:34:52] <Tennochief> you got 1 more to go
[1:34:52] <@DariusFTL> Putting the ward in the bush gives you sight into the bush.
[1:34:52] <IminyourBase> nice NA ward pat LUL
[1:34:53] <datmouse> it's not maxed you just licked w instead LUL
[1:34:54] <+RiceeFTW> no it's very clearly not max
[1:34:54] <+CloudsBringRain> Pat, you only have 4 points in E
[1:34:56] <%trustycoyote> 1 more point left
[1:34:57] <Calek> is Morgana still a good character
[1:34:57] <shiny_prinny> usually you put wards in bushes so enemies can be seen in them
[1:34:57] <tri3dgE027> Ward the bush not the areas you can see
[1:34:58] <+katarjin> LoL and not DOTA? ...fool
[1:34:58] <Vohs_Bru> Max.eeeeee
[1:35:03] <%kyh9> Put it into the bushes, it’ll illuminate the whole area in it and around
[1:35:06] <UnfilteredComic> F
[1:35:06] <Owlboy7> @AngriestPat the more people in a lane the less exp you get and it takes longer to level
[1:35:06] <%SvenHolgersson> Q TO RUNNN
[1:35:07] <Manwad> Ocean man, take me by the hand
[1:35:07] <%FrogROOT> forsenS
[1:35:08] <%BeardedLuchador> Kappa
[1:35:10] <The_Hand> @AngriestPat pat or paige, the idea with warding is mainly to put wards in bushes in places where you have blind spots on teh map to prevent you being assanated
[1:35:11] <reonome> F
[1:35:11] <+frunkAF> This sounds like a slot machine
[1:35:11] <+dirtyh4rr1> remember F
[1:35:11] <TheVoltStrike> YO, dodged his dash like a champ tho
[1:35:13] <leeroy418> it's 5 points for max skill Pat
[1:35:13] <%Dre_> buy black cleaver now @AngriestPat
[1:35:13] <+ChiefWilly> q is a good escage
[1:35:18] <xxafrodragonxx> F
[1:35:19] <Flickerember> Ah ya had the heal
[1:35:20] <+swaggopotamus> You wanna drop your R on them when they at about 1/3 to 1/4 health. Its an execution ability so it deals more damage when they are low.
[1:35:21] <Faultlined> Q to auto reset Pat to last hit better
[1:35:22] <NotLysander> Try to focus the ones with less dots on their HP bar, they are squishier
[1:35:22] <%lotharrio> AngeryPatStares
[1:35:23] <Haarute> urgot is pretty tanky, so maybe focus the other character first
[1:35:23] <%sectorquack> cleaver time
[1:35:23] <Imsoverylazy> BLACK CLEAVER NOW
[1:35:24] <ProfBadger> Oh goodness, I forgot about all the dragon changes, that's an issue
[1:35:24] <friendlyjoker312> PAT the spacebar focus the camera on your character
[1:35:24] <ReDexuz> buy the black vleaver
[1:35:24] <%einheri> You still had heal
[1:35:24] <marvel877> are ya winning, son?
[1:35:24] <Jontman42> Urgot does sound like a slotmachine lol
[1:35:24] <ContentNotFound> BUY ITEMS
[1:35:24] <Sumdumguyy> could have used q for speed boost and f to heal for heal and speed boost
[1:35:25] <BlackermanZX> @AngriestPat put the wards on the bushes
[1:35:26] <KattyCitty> exp is shared, gold only to who hits the dude
[1:35:28] <CriticKitten> Pat forgot he has the F key NotLikeThis
[1:35:29] <$narkonis> pat macro sense Pog
[1:35:30] <+Rooknasty1> Normally it is only you in top
[1:35:31] <%SvenHolgersson> Top lane and mid get the most xp early
[1:35:31] <+MrPashesh> If you put the ward in a bush you will be able to see more
[1:35:35] <Imsoverylazy> BIG AXE
[1:35:36] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat Laning phase is over
[1:35:37] <%StaceMcGate> its the opposite of HOTS Pat, you want individual gains over the good of the team
[1:35:37] <+0range_> YEAH
[1:35:38] <+FrenchTact1cs> Ward keep you alive
[1:35:38] <%BoboDaHobo> why does twitch prime just randomly decide not to autoresub sometimes

[1:35:45] <UnfilteredComic> BIGGER NUMBER
[1:35:45] <+HyperCharge_Sam> once the first lane towers get destroyed, people usually start to roam the rest of the map

[1:35:50] <%yasahiro1011> STRENGTH GO UP
[1:35:51] <TheVoltStrike> yeah i's a gun with blades
[1:35:51] <lvl10cybermancer> Basically the flow of hte game is that you stay in your lane until either your tower falls or theirs does, then go wherever your teammates are bunching up
[1:35:51] <ashuckel> make some ARMOR
[1:35:52] <%yasahiro1011> BUT WORD GO DOWN
[1:35:53] <Skatedeandre> Tyler1 was a rager and would constantly ruin games if no one listened to him/or team made too may mistakes
[1:35:54] <%greatbalwaagh> Number go UP
[1:35:54] <%Ranryu692> YOu can also double click on things to buy them, if you prefer
[1:35:54] <%sectorquack> PURCHASE
[1:35:55] <Fujiwara_92> AXE GUN
[1:35:55] <OToole42> @AngriestPat breaking a tower gives you a lot of gold and your team more map pressure, since the gold is given globally, if you can't get kills, you can at least break towers and provide gold to your team
[1:35:56] <+chase959> get a cloth armour
[1:35:57] <%a_wizard_in_space> WE IN THERE NOW
[1:35:58] <Venchair> Big axe shreds enemy armor
[1:35:58] <Jetsfantasy> Yes, the cleaver works amazing with Garen's E
[1:35:58] <bakkatohri> @AngriestPat There's a League wiki which has more comprehensive information on each champ than the client does. If you want to know about damage scaling ratios, you can check it out
[1:35:58] <+GeneralHysterics> big strong man
[1:35:59] <%SvenHolgersson> If you hit stuff you do more damage
[1:35:59] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> STRENGTH GO UP
[1:35:59] <$CarlosEoM> what timeline is this?
[1:36:00] <IminyourBase> now your autoattacks have AOE dmg
[1:36:01] <%MaddyCaddy> You can switch lanes and help the team now
[1:36:03] <ReDexuz> yeah, its raining
[1:36:04] <+ChiefWilly> what do you think chat, something like randuin or sunfire next?
[1:36:04] <+crackheadcontrol> big axe makes their armor go down and makes you go faster when you hit them with spin
[1:36:09] <Vohs_Bru> The GUN is good Kenny, you should get the GUN
[1:36:10] <Tennochief> honestly, SMITE is simpler and easier to play
[1:36:11] <UnfilteredComic> You can click on the map or long moving, so that you dont have to click as much
[1:36:12] <%WritebroAlpha> Next buy SUNFIRE CAPE
[1:36:13] <KattyCitty> @angriestpat if you auto then q immediately you hit faster
[1:36:14] <%coffeeabomination> GUN GO UP

[1:36:19] <ShadeTheNovice> LUL
[1:36:20] <%yasahiro1011> YOUR TOILET HAS BEEN DESTROYED
[1:36:20] <%Alpha8087> TOILET AT RISK
[1:36:20] <+GeneralHysterics> LOL
[1:36:20] <Fancypants25> TOILET DOWNH
[1:36:21] <Tunykun> I mean, they kinda look like toilets

[1:36:23] <lvl10cybermancer> TOILET DESTROYED
[1:36:23] <%Valdorick> RIP Toilet
[1:36:25] <VritraReiRei> DEAF AND BLIND
[1:36:25] <@DariusFTL> Avenge the toilet
[1:36:26] <ProfBadger> there's a blaance, so you can't max a skill immediately.
[1:36:27] <+silvery_cricket> better ward placement
[1:36:28] <pitsuji> !!TOILET AT RISK!!
[1:36:28] <IminyourBase> BEST WARDS LUL
[1:36:29] <alrobot2014> yeah looking at this i've come to appreciate how easy SMITE is
[1:36:30] <Jetsfantasy> You can't always level up skills if you dump points into only one move
[1:36:31] <%President_Miyazaki> Turlet has been destroyed
[1:36:34] <%terribleusername> Destroyed an enemy toilet
[1:36:34] <Fujiwara_92> YOUR TOILET HAS BEEN DESTROYED
[1:36:34] <%greatbalwaagh> @angriestpat inversely Sweeper (red trinket) is good for clearing wards and limiting enemy map awareness
[1:36:36] <%SvenHolgersson> PAT GET BACK
[1:36:36] <%AngriestAngryArtist> DESTROY THE TOILET! NOW Nobody takes a shit!
[1:36:36] <+FrenchTact1cs> Better Idea to ward thier jungle
[1:36:37] <Skatedeandre> TURRLET
[1:36:38] <NotLysander> Pat you are past laneing phase now. You can go where you think you might be needed most
[1:36:40] <Vohs_Bru> Pat look like a keyboard player
[1:36:42] <%FrogROOT> hes a circle
[1:36:43] <Flickerember> @AngriestPat Always spend ya gold if you can. Can big brain save later but if you can get something decent like a 300 item go ahead
[1:36:44] <UnfilteredComic> W
[1:36:44] <shockmaster3> I love paige
[1:36:44] <$narkonis> Certain abilities can only be leveled up at certain levels. Hence why he can only level up his ultimate once every 2-3 levels after he gets access to it at level 6 @PeachSaliva
[1:36:48] <+CloudsBringRain> BIG HEAL
[1:36:50] <+GeneralHysterics> This is a real treat
[1:36:50] <+ManlyPillow> LUL
[1:36:51] <The_Hand> @AngriestPat the reason you cant level up some abilities more is because it forces you to split across your other abilities, this is to prevent any early op bs
[1:36:54] <TheVoltStrike> oh man this feels so nostalgic for some reason
[1:36:54] <%kyh9> Axe gun
[1:36:55] <UnfilteredComic> Yes
[1:36:55] <+BiggestBuckets> theres that turret again lol
[1:36:55] <GKannel> You could've taken it
[1:36:56] <Tunykun> His knees are shotguns
[1:36:56] <BlackermanZX> That urgot is angry
[1:36:56] <%ImmaCanuck> whiff
[1:36:57] <%SvenHolgersson> Its his passive
[1:36:58] <%Tallie> he has shotgun knees
[1:36:58] <%Dulzara> SHOTGUN KNEES.
[1:36:58] <Venchair> Your W reduces damage when you press it
[1:36:59] <%pectusumbra> His kneess are shotguns
[1:37:00] <$Mothman742> @angriestpat u are extremely cool and strong as well paige
[1:37:00] <Faultlined> Those green marks are his shotgun knees
[1:37:00] <%sectorquack> he learn
[1:37:00] <Jontman42> His knees are shotguns
[1:37:00] <lvl10cybermancer> He has shotgun knees
[1:37:00] <%Ranryu692> you have a big sword at all times
[1:37:01] <%Dre_> shotgun knees
[1:37:01] <suikudo> In those situations you should go after the turret before the minions
[1:37:01] <Manwad> He has shotgun knees
[1:37:02] <Vohs_Bru> Peram Shotgun
[1:37:03] <Tennochief> @alrobot2014 especially with the 3rd person, super convenient and a nice change of pace
[1:37:03] <+chase959> his knees are shotguns @AngriestPat
[1:37:04] <VritraReiRei> He's got Shotgun LEGS
[1:37:05] <+ygernesfeld> he has shotgun knees

[1:37:06] <%StaceMcGate> get wrecked
[1:37:06] <+AnxiousLogan> his shotgun passive is based around his crab legs
[1:37:06] <ashuckel> @AngriestPat it's okay to take some damage as garen, your passive heals you
[1:37:07] <Tarviti> @AngriestPat check your Ult it can instakill enemies under a certain percent health
[1:37:09] <%Valdorick> RIP
[1:37:10] <Jetsfantasy> Urgotted
[1:37:10] <%StaceMcGate> no

[1:38:08] <$narkonis> Kayn is popping off
[1:38:08] <Jetsfantasy> Illidan is
[1:38:08] <Vohs_Bru> but then you met Paige
[1:38:09] <alrobot2014> smite is definitely an easier moba to roll into
[1:38:09] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> THIS KAYNE IS NOT NEW

[1:38:12] <%a_wizard_in_space> This is legit getting me to want to play League again
[1:38:14] <%Madbearv> Pat, that's too real
[1:38:17] <+AnxiousLogan> kayne is a smurf
[1:38:19] <%dasmause> trist and kayn carry
[1:38:20] <+Dr_Mooose> Smite is underrated
[1:38:21] <nootsandbooter> this is making me want to try a MOBA again and I do not like that feeling but I like the stream
[1:38:21] <horsesaredumb> @angriestpat Try playing Aatrox hashAya
[1:38:21] <ShadeTheNovice> That Kayne is a smurf for sure
[1:38:22] <Zedimonx5> Please just go back to the adventures of Norman Fetus delivery simulator KappaRoss
[1:38:23] <pitsuji> THATS JUST KAYN

[1:38:24] <+Bigby32> grocery store POG
[1:38:24] <Tarviti> Penta = Free push
[1:38:24] <Quietshun13> Yeah smite is easier to get into
[1:38:25] <+silvery_cricket> Urgot(The green spider one) has a special ability where a green ring forms around him. his first attack against something in part of the ring will deal bonus damage. So try and stay in the rings blind spots.
[1:38:26] <IminyourBase> pat push the lane
[1:38:27] <TheVoltStrike> yeah assassins pop off
[1:38:27] <blaggablag> Hey you're picking up those lasthits
[1:38:28] <+MrPashesh> This is way more interesting to watch than pro players
[1:38:28] <TheBlindFlock> The guy you are facing is called Urgot. His shotguns are based on his legs. You can see if he’s got a shotgun blast ready via the arrows around his body.
[1:38:30] <Jontman42> Being so far removed from the newbie experience it's really cool to watch you learn
[1:38:30] <ashuckel> pat is getting carried super hard, and they are just stalling for fun and KDA
[1:38:30] <iamtheTwitchghost> PLAY DOTA BITCH
[1:38:31] <%Agami23> penta is the entire enemy party. tristiana however just destroyed all the bot turrets by herself
[1:38:32] <friendlyjoker312> PAT you dont have to stay TOP the entire game, follow your team to the other lanes
[1:38:34] <@commanderclaw> Pat who has a mustard princess and a cat in his life is no longer the angriest
[1:38:34] <Tennochief> remember that you have to pay for every champion in LOL
[1:38:35] <+HyperCharge_Sam> keep pushing the lane pat and get the tower
[1:38:35] <arkv01> now its low testosterone pat
[1:38:35] <shiny_prinny> now you max your q for the damage
[1:38:36] <Skatedeandre> Those are relatively hard to get
[1:38:40] <nikoloas_> oh damn that kayn is smurfing
[1:38:41] <%ImmaCanuck> Pat there's also a middle and bottom lane Kappa
[1:38:41] <%trustycoyote> Seems like the Illidan not Illidan champ is killin it
[1:38:41] <dmtjinni> Angriest Pat ----> Sweetest Pat
[1:38:41] <Quite_Dapper> Paige will soar to the top of the League of Legends page on Twitch in no time
[1:38:42] <%SvenHolgersson> PUSH PAT PSUHHHHHHHHHHH

[1:38:48] <UnfilteredComic> KILL HER
[1:38:48] <Goldenwolf98> PUSH HARDER AND FASTER Kappa
[1:38:50] <$narkonis> @AngriestPat at this point you should be with your team grouped up so you can end quicker.
[1:38:51] <%Valdorick> RIVEN IS FEEDING
[1:38:51] <%deviljhojho_> what is this
[1:38:52] <Fujiwara_92> no but more
[1:38:53] <Tennochief> DOTA and SMITE have options to play everyone for free
[1:38:53] <Jontman42> Is that Riven a bot
[1:38:53] <leeroy418> feeeeding
[1:38:54] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> LOL IS FOR BABIES, DOTA IS IS FOR MEN
[1:38:54] <IminyourBase> he's feeding

[1:38:57] <Diet_z_dan> INTING Pog
[1:38:57] <ProfBadger> that guy is inting
[1:38:57] <MessyBristles> he's int-ing
[1:38:58] <Finchit> riven is a bot 100%

[1:38:58] <+chase959> INTing
[1:38:58] <ReDexuz> inting
[1:38:58] <+patel347> hes feeding
[1:38:58] <%RayDaug> @Dr_Mooose I dropped Smite for League years ago, but I like Guan Yu more than any Leauge champ
[1:38:59] <%Dulzara> RUNNING IT DOWN
[1:38:59] <pigliiplays> that dude was feeding or super afk
[1:38:59] <%galaxyswirl> that was a feeder
[1:39:00] <+0range_> he gave up
[1:39:00] <%SvenHolgersson> That Riven is probably a child
[1:39:01] <xxafrodragonxx> PogChamp
[1:39:01] <%sectorquack> $600
[1:39:01] <lvl10cybermancer> You'd be better served by grouping up with your teammates at this point in the game actually
[1:39:03] <+laurapostvoice> Man I haven't played LoL in forever. nostalgia
[1:39:04] <itwebb85> The FEEDS
[1:39:04] <+MaximumDongExpansion> He a bot.
[1:39:04] <Jontman42> That Riven might be a bot
[1:39:05] <%SashaStarshine> @PeachSalive make sure to let Pat know that the matchmaking is always fucked up on an account's first 10 games or so because the obvious smurfs haven't been weeded out. Kayn and Urgot this game for example both know what they are doing
[1:39:06] <Sacksquatch> Big feeds
[1:39:06] <Vohs_Bru> Paige got a hairy chest now its proven
[1:39:08] <ContentNotFound> HE GAVE UP LUL
[1:39:08] <$hoghoncho> feeding
[1:39:08] <nikoloas_> riven is just running it down
[1:39:09] <+GeneralHysterics> Pat can smell the toxicity
[1:39:09] <TwinBat> if pat was low test he'd have all his hair
[1:39:09] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> PLAY DOTA YOU PUSSY
[1:39:10] <+silvery_cricket> If you press Q it will instantly put you in your attack animation, so it can help you last hit
[1:39:10] <%boxofhooligans> That is called inting, Pat
[1:39:10] <simifu> Hey guys, its not the full league of legends experience if us the chat aren't being toxic towards pat Kappa
[1:39:12] <ShadeTheNovice> He's inting cause they losing so hard
[1:39:12] <arkv01> but push harder tho
[1:39:12] <Imsoverylazy> YOU GOT MONEY FOR IT. IT COUNTS
[1:39:13] <%BeefyQueefer> Paige "Hairy Tits" Saliva
[1:39:14] <Haarute> you're new, there's probably like 10 years old playing this game for the first time too
[1:39:17] <KattyCitty> abilities don't hit towers
[1:39:17] <%WritebroAlpha> Feeding
[1:39:17] <%Verd_254> q does
[1:39:18] <pigliiplays> oh pat your spin doesn't work on towers just fyi
[1:39:19] <%Taisuru> Only q damages the tower
[1:39:19] <Tennochief> abilities don't work on towers
[1:39:19] <shiny_prinny> they could have legitimately been not paying attention but probably feeding
[1:39:19] <%wujak> most skills dont hit towers
[1:39:20] <%SvenHolgersson> Cant auto when youre using your E
[1:39:20] <Tunykun> Yeah hit the tower with your spin lol
[1:39:20] <Skatedeandre> That’s a form of toxicity
[1:39:21] <Faultlined> Q on Turret Pat
[1:39:21] <%StaceMcGate> LOL is toxic confirmed
[1:39:24] <ashuckel> YES THAT E
[1:39:27] <%Dre_> your Q works on towers
[1:39:27] <ShadeTheNovice> They are basically giving up
[1:39:28] <TheVoltStrike> Only some specific skills deal damage on turrets
[1:39:28] <InXplotch> @AngriestPat unlike hots most spells cannot hit enemy structures
[1:39:29] <+0range_> Q on turret no E
[1:39:30] <TheWashoutXY> Sure Pat Kappa
[1:39:33] <+chase959> @AngriestPat feeding is unintentional and INTing is on purpose
[1:39:35] <TheBasicEvil> League is one of the MOBAs where abilities rarely work on towers
[1:39:35] <ashuckel> E the tower pat
[1:39:35] <Jarvanii> Pat, in the future just look up the order to level up abilities for every new champion you pick up
[1:39:36] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @AngriestPat Your ***Q*** will hit towers, but your E and R won't
[1:39:37] <%Ranryu692> spin doesnt work on towers but Q does
[1:39:38] <IminyourBase> pat run!
[1:39:38] <arkv01> LoL's toxicity has only grown since 2010
[1:39:44] <%sectorquack> do not challenge urgot ffs
[1:39:45] <%augusm> Did he just say "I WILL NOT CALL HER"
[1:39:45] <NotLysander> you cant 1v1 urgot

[1:39:47] <pigliiplays> this urgot is a beefy boy

[1:39:50] <UnfilteredComic> You need to help your friends
[1:39:51] <rubbishbinge> lol
[1:39:51] <+Dr_Mooose> yeesh this urgot
[1:39:52] <KattyCitty> @AngriestPat the only abilities that hit towers are abilities that are just auto attacks
[1:39:52] <%ComicLord> @AngriestPat you should focus on not getting hit and hitting other people
[1:39:53] <Tarviti> Pay attention to enemy level
[1:39:56] <+patel347> ITEMS
[1:39:57] <Tunykun> Its ok, Kanye is winning

[1:49:04] <%Alpha8087> @StridentSong Ah gotcha!
[1:49:07] <$Dakuu75> Mobafire, search the champion, click on a guide with high-amount-of-votes
[1:49:07] <%augusm> Jesus Christ I'm paying $2146 Canadian Dollareedoos in rent fuck London
[1:49:07] <TheWashoutXY> @InXplotch good for a noob
[1:49:08] <%immortanjoestar> lmao
[1:49:08] <trueherobappo> its icyvein for league
[1:49:08] <%a_wizard_in_space> it shows tons of builds for league
[1:49:12] <maverickdrifter> Pat it’s too early for April fools
[1:49:13] <+GeneralHysterics> Senna is dope
[1:49:14] <%pectusumbra> literally lucian's wife
[1:49:15] <TyrantBelial> Pat why are you dfoing this to yourself
[1:49:18] <%truesleepking> @AngriestPat Best advice can only really be obtained from other players
[1:49:19] <UnfilteredComic> Yes
[1:49:20] <LtSolo> wait pat is playing mobas now
[1:49:23] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @AngriestPat check out the League of Legends Wikia and go to a site called U gg. The Wiki is a breakdown of champs and their abilities and how they work, u gg gives you the builds that people commonly use
[1:49:23] <Deepified> unless mobafire has strict moderation now I would NOT recommend mobafire
[1:49:24] <rubbishbinge> VaingloryFire
[1:49:27] <Aristotlay> LOL tampa thinks its a bay area
[1:49:29] <Jontman42> It's a meme that mobafire is bad, it's perfectly good for general guides
[1:49:29] <+KewlDude141> you can also check out League Wiki
[1:49:30] <LtSolo> why not play Dota, it's actually good
[1:49:30] <Venchair> OPGG is just for builds and not for guides
[1:49:32] <%SvenHolgersson> Some of those guides are fucking Novellas
[1:49:33] <$Dakuu75> lmfao
[1:49:35] <%boxofhooligans> Woolie playing this too?
[1:49:37] <%kyh9> Why do people give the shittiest advice when it comes to League
[1:49:39] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat is cool with the cools
[1:49:40] <dero45> smite has better tutorials
[1:49:40] <UnfilteredComic> Mobafire is great for starting out
[1:49:40] <ContentNotFound> PogChamp NOT A BOOMER
[1:49:41] <%immortanjoestar> pat should play mordekaise
[1:49:42] <+eggstyr0ne> play dota 2 and get your guides fed to you via machine learning
[1:49:43] <%terribleusername> how do you do, fellow mobers
[1:49:44] <InXplotch> I havent even heard of people using mobafire in like 6 years
[1:49:44] <+KewlDude141> each champion has their abilities broken down and patch history
[1:49:45] <simifu> Pat are you squishy?
[1:49:45] <+Neoepochx> For a quick build I always just used ***
[1:49:46] <%HollowedIdjit> Is Lifesteal Vlad Jungle still one of the highest rated builds on Mobafire?
[1:49:46] <ThirdPersonPhil> Cant wait for the next podcast
[1:49:48] <%LaughingCatt> crendorHigh
