[0:03:59] <%StaceMcGate> I'm more curious if people will still play this in five years, if you lose the multiplayer involvement and like system... will it still be enjoyable?
[0:04:03] <SolverCODO> feed us
[0:04:03] <wicketpelican> Is Pat grinding offscreen?

[0:05:04] <%Captainahab_37> I'm on chapter 8 and I'm not...enjoying it
[0:05:04] <Skatedeandre> 10 HOUR MOVE?

[0:05:18] <nigawatts1988> Chapter 8 of what?
[0:05:23] <%StaceMcGate> @holydeviant1 Right, but the appeal for Death Stranding is the interaction with other players. You want to be helpful to others because they give you likes. But if everything is already built and you can't get likes; is the game still fun?
[0:05:25] <%mield916> it's also better he grinds offscreen. there's so much stuff to do in game with the ranking stuff.
[0:05:26] <%Captainahab_37> Death Stranding

[0:07:23] <%mield916> got my unironic one right here pat
[0:07:24] <%ShichiNoBushi> It might change if you progress through the game a bit.

[0:07:53] <%corepool> i mean somebody'
[0:07:54] <%StaceMcGate> Pokemon is getting review bombed, most publications gave it an 8 or higher
[0:07:56] <%tizz86> @spacecatstreams no problem!
[0:07:57] <%ShichiNoBushi> Piss ON, ghost.

[0:08:04] <holydeviant1> I'm really happy that the Urinate command works on BTs
[0:08:05] <%Tucker0603> make sure you combo that ghost with your piss
[0:08:05] <%Captainahab_37> why do people say red bull tastes so bad
[0:08:06] <FrankysDream> omg that's why
[0:08:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> its scratches
[0:08:13] <%Anime_Flux> heh
[0:08:14] <+Pendlez> bottoms up and kojima laughs
[0:08:16] <astroPunkFunk> n i c e
[0:08:23] <Neathergrasp> pat blend it with redbull for maximum power
[0:08:23] <%colouroftheiris77> But isn't Monster gross ass shite?
[0:08:25] <%thegreenbenis> apatCanada HOLD OUT YOUR PINKIE FANCY BOY
[0:08:26] <%Ner234> YEAH
[0:08:27] <beno1133> Good one
[0:08:28] <%Meow0369> Pat the power skeleton while sprinting does make it more stable btw
[0:08:28] <FrankysDream> That's why kojima wanted the sponsership
[0:08:30] <%valriot> Okay but technically YOU DO optimise loads
[0:08:31] <astroPunkFunk> norman reedus
[0:08:31] <%spacecatstreams> christ that was dead on arrival
[0:08:33] <%StaceMcGate> Pat was making a joke about ejaculation
[0:08:33] <%ShichiNoBushi> Back down.

[0:08:46] <%iamtrlly> so Death Stranding is basically an action adventure Sim City?
[0:08:49] <PunishedMercer_> fortnut on the ghosts
[0:08:52] <DrGasMax> I think Monster is in the game because Norman probably always brought a Monster to capture sessions because he was always Jet Lagged to shit and Kojima noticed and decided to add it into the game
[0:08:54] <%Meow0369> Sprinting with the power skele uses more power and increases the stability of your load if it's heavy
[0:08:54] <%ShichiNoBushi> I'm necrotising right now.
[0:08:55] <astroPunkFunk> impossibly perfect
[0:08:55] <AmericanaRed> TRY HARD PAT

[0:12:49] <+machshop> it's like a mix between a ring pop and a fun dip
[0:12:50] <+bigboyeggo> NO
[0:12:50] <AmericanaRed> LUL LUL LUL

[0:13:06] <Skatedeandre> No not those
[0:13:10] <%Shadowthedigger> It is literally shaped like a baby bottle.
[0:13:11] <Ahk_90> Basically the same, but different
[0:13:11] <%radda343> it's a sucker with a bottle of sour powder
[0:13:11] <%Rngiddion> its like a ring pop that you dip is a powered sugarish thing

[0:13:14] <%Keyd00d> it's called Big Baby Bop in other places I think
[0:13:16] <@SSaryn> It's literally in the form of a like a weird bottle you feed babies milk
[0:13:21] <holydeviant1> For some reason I always find jokes funnier when they're shouted from a distance
[0:13:21] <%xtremegamer80> *Pop
[0:13:23] <%bevyrage> @AngriestPat think ring pop but shaped like a baby bottle with powder inside you're suppose to dip the top into
[0:13:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> might not be in Quebec. Quebec is basically Europe.
[0:13:24] <%Shadowthedigger> Must not be a Canada thing
[0:13:25] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Propose to Paige with a ring pop.
[0:13:27] <%valriot> Jodie is BB

[0:13:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> it is a canada thing tho
[0:13:38] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat the top looks like a baby bottle. The bottle itself is full of flavor powder you can shake onto the sucker. It's weird.
[0:13:42] <+machshop> is aiden a BT?
[0:13:42] <luchyninja> You gotta watch the commercials for the pops.

[0:18:28] <+NitronStreams> if the FTC thinks your video is for kids and you make it as not for kids you can be fined
[0:18:29] <Conky89> As Youtube was getting bigger and started attracting the attention of major companies, all these new rules were inevitable.
[0:18:30] <%valriot> BB IS A BABY, THEREFORE BANNED
[0:18:30] <+griffball13> but if it's marked for adults then whats the problem
[0:18:31] <+MadPretty> holy fuck

[0:19:29] <%xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat It's literally parents who're too lazy or don't care enough to watch their own damn channel.
[0:19:30] <%Meow0369> So what you're saying is that if you're not for the kids you should be swearing and posting scantily clad pictures to tell YouTube's algorithm that it's not for the kids, despite you specifying your channel is not for the kids already so it shouldn't matter
[0:19:31] <%Willbo_Baggins> jesus christ
[0:19:32] <%iamtrlly> just start every video with "fuck you kids"
[0:19:34] <+TekkieX> Gonna have to start every video by saying "Fuck, shit, piss, cunt" then.

[0:20:15] <+RSNoon> The law might not apply to you, but it'll give YouTube a reason to shut down your channel if they found a problem with it
[0:20:17] <DrGasMax> You would not believe how many parents will just hand their child a smartphone and pull up youtube just to get them to be quiet
[0:20:21] <IAmYoungDabNow> @fuggins4u heh
[0:20:22] <sasparillatango> FCC is a captured agency that only exists to squeeze small companies out in favor of larger companies
[0:20:24] <%Fenrirlives> Sucks for Family Friendly Content Creators. Guys who don't want to upload vulgar content are now the most vulnerable just for trying
[0:20:24] <holydeviant1> FCC: Remember, we were founded because someone tricked AMERICA INTO THINKING IT WAS BEING INVADED BY ALIENS

[0:20:59] <%Anime_Flux> ...why are you guys talking about the FCC... it's the FTC that's doing the Coppa thing. Federal Trade Commission
[0:21:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> in canada TV teetaws has always been a thing. first time I saw boobs on TV was on CBC
[0:21:05] <Fujiwara_92> I saw that video, i was like FUCK
[0:21:05] <%chiluzza> it hit the dude who made the Astartes mini series

[0:21:27] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Moe?
[0:21:28] <%Razputin217> If only the FCC weren’t run by a lawyer that works for Verizon...
[0:21:30] <%Tucker0603> @angriestpat the guy who does Astartes series got his channel stolen

[0:26:12] <+PirateMike_> I like you in secret
[0:26:15] <Solidus_113> I finished the game at 58 hours
[0:26:16] <%Meow0369> Keep your eyes on the road when you're driving JEEZ
[0:26:19] <%ShichiNoBushi> Equip it as clothing (up d-pad) and play it as you rest (hold-O).
[0:26:21] <%Fenrirlives> Oh the guy that sung Pop Virus?
[0:26:21] <%UberKingKai> apatWrong
[0:26:24] <+pittbulldogg> shits kinda loud....maybe just the sfx
[0:26:29] <%Typhaeon> Jesus this road is ridiculously long
[0:26:30] <Ion_Laser> @MetalMongger It's a Paperboy remake
[0:26:31] <Isord> How do you even use the swimming cap?
[0:26:32] <%StaceMcGate> I watched girlfriend reviews stream this, took about 5 days of 8-9 hour streams. Game takes a minute
[0:26:33] <dukenux> :)
[0:26:33] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat Do roads last forever?
[0:26:36] <+bigboyeggo> no i did :)
[0:26:37] <old_dog_god> Dog building one fucking patch of road outside Lake Knot gave me beaucoup likes
[0:26:38] <%valriot> @angriestpat I very much recommend doing the Cosplayer NPC on stream
[0:26:40] <Angry_Ev1L> roads work i n a way that it's mostly me for everyone
[0:26:40] <Hydrapissed> no i Did :)
[0:26:41] <%deviljhojho_> i did this tomatoSmile
[0:26:42] <SlappinNightjargowoooo> :)
[0:26:42] <SunnyVarietyPack> hey i built a secton
[0:26:42] <Conky89> Okay. I believe you.
[0:26:42] <%ShichiNoBushi> You made this? *I* made this.
[0:26:43] <ExpressNode> Transcontinental Highway by Pat
[0:26:46] <Isord> I just ford the rivers with the truck
[0:26:47] <mondumbra> remember when pat showed his balls on stream
[0:26:50] <Fujiwara_92> I did this :)
[0:26:53] <%Meow0369> Roads effectively last forever, at least while there are so many players
[0:26:55] <%marvel877> They break down, but you can fix them up.
[0:27:01] <%This_is_Marco> Where was Geoff? I missed him
[0:27:05] <Ted_the_red> it seems that you have to put most of the materials into the roads yourself and only a portion from other players goes into your session
[0:27:06] <old_dog_god> I’m like SSGSS Mover or some shit
[0:27:08] <%valriot> COUNTRY ROOOOAD
[0:27:15] <Calek> building a road to at least here is such a huge help
[0:27:21] <EuropanLamprey> Is this just minecraft but with roads?
[0:27:24] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> "So I did some building offscreen".
[0:27:26] <+Jordan_z123> Geoff is in the first map I think
[0:27:28] <+loukemia83> its almost like roads are useful

[0:30:50] <DrGasMax> yeah if you go out on a run with less then 30 kgs you are missing something
[0:30:50] <Mendin> The L1/L2 were fatter I think
[0:30:54] <%Meow0369> You'll unlock a backpack upgrade soon from this dist centre that lets you put grenades on it without taking cargo space
[0:30:55] <wannabemoogle> hell yeah it does

[0:31:31] <+bigboyeggo> snow monkaS
[0:31:31] <%StaceMcGate> Beware the ghost rivers
[0:31:35] <wannabemoogle> This gonna be fun
[0:31:39] <%ShichiNoBushi> You can bypass the ghosts and don't have to deal with them if you go around.
[0:31:39] <Demon_chann> i saw cohh carnage streams the madman build stuff for likr 4 hours
[0:31:40] <%supersugoisenpai1> Ghosts, slopes, and ropes, oh my!
[0:31:40] <holydeviant1> Warning, @AngriestPat SCAN ALL RIVERS FROM NOW ON OR YOU WILL REGRET IT

[0:32:07] <london_flexing> Does Pat know how to show the topological map?
[0:32:09] <%ShichiNoBushi> Power Skeleton is vital at this point.
[0:32:14] <%Divryne> Just drive better you fool.
[0:32:16] <Isord> you COULD take the bike
[0:32:18] <astroPunkFunk> say hi to BB

[0:33:21] <%UberKingKai> apatGib apatGib
[0:33:21] <%GarbageNirvana> Basically the game forces you through the rough shit before you get the network set up and then you see everything everyone set up to make that trip easier
[0:33:22] <%narusao> apatGib
[0:33:22] <%Anime_Flux> oh damn
[0:33:23] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Elmo is stored in the balls.
[0:33:23] <+StrawberryPantsu> Avoiding BTs is also Tense as fuck

[0:33:37] <%StaceMcGate> I mean you're not wrong
[0:33:37] <+ThePayphone> my favorite parts of open world games are when you just had a quest to go from point a to point b and found little things along the way
[0:33:38] <+Weeewer> Thats not even close to a fair comparison lol
[0:33:39] <%Meow0369> Pat you need the backpack upgrade jeeeeeeez free grenade slots
[0:33:41] <EuropanLamprey> Its hidef weird minecraft

[0:33:50] <+AndeOneNine> Case in point skeleton in a hat
[0:33:55] <CptHarlok> I concur.
[0:33:57] <%Anime_Flux> meat... home...?
[0:33:57] <Mendin> No wonder you bought this house with its LITERAL DUNGEON
[0:34:02] <jimmytwofeet> how long has the stream been up for pls?
[0:34:02] <%FrostMass22> Meat home?
[0:34:02] <%windsoc> @AngriestPat hey pat do you plan on getting max rep with everyone?
[0:34:04] <viredae> the home for your meat!
[0:34:05] <%Doruben> the meathome could be a box
[0:34:06] <%GarbageNirvana> I'd decorate but that costs money
[0:34:08] <%valriot> Honestly though, the same people complaining about this games gameplay strike me as the same who don't think DMC or Revengeance "works" or is unfair
[0:34:13] <%keyworthe> i also have no desire to decorate my meat home
[0:34:13] <%UberKingKai> You can’t pee on Tom nook like the capitalist anarch you are
[0:34:14] <%Keyd00d> WOW
[0:34:15] <ScootyMcRoger> meat home is what me n the boys used to call my foreskin in college
[0:34:15] <TikanZK> I feel like when you get a house IRL the appeal of Animal Crossing goes away
[0:34:15] <alwayspronking> but you're sitting in front of a decorative skeleton and painting right now! @AngriestPat
[0:34:15] <%ShichiNoBushi> function > form
[0:34:16] <old_dog_god> See if Isabelle was in the jar instead of the baby this game would be a perfect 10/10
[0:34:16] <caja_de_ojos> @angriestpat hey i have some minor allergies to cats do you use something to not die next to Elmo
[0:34:16] <%Typhaeon> LuL

[0:34:17] <@Fuggins4U> Squatty {atty
[0:34:17] <%StaceMcGate> @Weeewer Nah, it's fair. Both highlights of those games are that they are relaxing and building upon the world brings a sense of satisfaction
[0:34:18] <+ThePayphone> taking a shit
[0:34:18] <%Ner234> PAT
[0:34:21] <%Meow0369> help edgar wright and you can add shit all over your backpack

[0:34:47] <%FrostMass22> The meat home is where the skeleton lives
[0:34:47] <Neathergrasp> has asylum for the fellings played yet?
[0:34:49] <PinkSocks> Good guy Pat
[0:34:51] <Ion_Laser> *Dubstep Intro*
[0:34:52] <%floralkami> he says as Skelmo stands idly by
[0:34:52] <+Weeewer> @StaceMcGate the 'building upon the world' in animal crossing is unfunctional and doesnt impact other players so id say thats a fairly shallow comparison
[0:34:56] <%marvel877> NO SHIT
[0:34:57] <Demon_chann> did you hit that subscribe buttom
[0:34:59] <%valriot> Okay yo for real, seeing some cheeky fuck give me one like is BULLSHIT
[0:35:00] <Zomner> rocks DansGame
[0:35:02] <Ted_the_red> yeah this area sucks
[0:35:02] <%Meow0369> It getsworse
[0:35:02] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Well fuck
[0:35:04] <Ahk_90> Yup, that looks rough
[0:35:05] <%Laecerelius> So many likes!
[0:35:06] <%AncelDeLambert> I think I can put the appeal of this game in a word and that's "trailblazing". The game is primarily about trailblazing and producing your own path that you then develop
[0:35:08] <CptHarlok> You ain't seen nothing yet...
[0:35:08] <Isord> That side of the hill does suck, yes
[0:35:10] <%Ner234> What a shitshow.
[0:35:11] <%Maids4lyfe> you know what would get rid of that terrain? a nice voidout Kappa
[0:35:12] <holydeviant1> WELCOME TO BASALT COLUMN: THE SEQUEL
[0:35:20] <Meekest> This game seems oddly satisfying
[0:35:21] <$FluffiTamamo> It’s BT land too
[0:35:21] <+bigboyeggo> @Neathergrasp iirc it played right before pat got to the place where you fight the first boss
[0:35:23] <%ShichiNoBushi> Yeah. This terrain SUUUUUUCKS. Though if you walk/drive through it enough, you wear out paths.
[0:35:25] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat ever get the feeling that Sam is supposed to be talking directly to the player?
[0:35:26] <%Ner234> Ghosts WutFace
[0:35:27] <%Keyd00d> training
[0:35:27] <%FrostMass22> @anceldelambert It's like Manifest Destiny the game
[0:35:29] <%THATGUY_789> Pat's home is apt as it looks like something a goblin would live in
[0:35:30] <london_flexing> @AngriestPat You could have seen it earlier using the topological map
[0:35:31] <%Meow0369> Pat you can sprint you have the power lvl 3 it's increased stability when sprinting -_-
[0:35:39] <%valriot> WHAT????
[0:35:41] <%StaceMcGate> @Weeewer I haven't played, just heard from my friends and family. I had thought you could visit and interact with other's towns
[0:35:41] <old_dog_god> Gotta get that “likecin” to not be depressed about never being able to fuck because a baby could potentially die
[0:35:42] <%AncelDeLambert> @FrostMass22 more correct than wrong, yes
[0:35:42] <%drabberfaun535> How well does he rack in the likes with that road?
[0:35:43] <%xtremegamer80> Oh??
[0:35:44] <Ahk_90> LOLWUT!?
[0:35:44] <%Maids4lyfe> wait really?
[0:35:44] <Zomner> oh fuck
[0:35:46] <%keyworthe> what hte fuck
[0:35:47] <viredae> equip the ebola gun!
[0:35:47] <%GarbageNirvana> huh
[0:35:50] <%THATGUY_789> Gooooooooold
[0:35:51] <wannabemoogle> Gold ghost sounds sick
[0:35:51] <Neathergrasp> @bigboyeggo neat
[0:35:52] <+AndeOneNine> Damn Pre-order bonus ghosts
[0:35:52] <%Tucker0603> NANI da that?
[0:35:52] <Calek> fighitng BT's and summoning the mini boss is such a good way to get chiral crystals
[0:35:54] <%StaceMcGate> You get this cutscene EVERY time
[0:35:55] <tiaramaki> WHAT?
[0:35:55] <%valriot> I'm on chapter 6 and haven't seen that
[0:35:57] <+NitronStreams> Americas Haunted
[0:36:03] <caja_de_ojos> have u died yet?
[0:36:08] <aeonicvector> Americas Haunted
[0:36:10] <MrCheesyFondue> Game over as in insta kill or like play through over shit?
[0:36:11] <%Laecerelius> Gold ghosts?!
[0:36:13] <+studiocomfy> what's keeping you from going to canada?
[0:36:14] <PinkSocks> Where did he die?
[0:36:15] <%rytisone> Wish there was a day/night cycle
[0:36:18] <%marvel877> If you dont see a sign warning BTs, youll see a bunch of abandoned trucks/trikes that just scream BTs.
[0:36:21] <%valriot> Oh yeah I learnt that early on
[0:36:34] <%ShichiNoBushi> You could just go around them.
[0:36:34] <CptHarlok> Is it just me, or does scanning only show BT's like 33% of the time?
[0:36:37] <%UberKingKai> @pinksocks off screen early on I think
[0:36:37] <%valriot> Look at that good ass rope
[0:36:38] <+PirateMike_> I cant stand left side view
[0:36:40] <+bigboyeggo> inb4 crazy talk
[0:36:42] <%Meow0369> I never got a voidout in my game
[0:36:42] <%Anime_Flux> spooky
[0:36:43] <%Who_lio42> you got any peepee or poopoo on you
[0:36:44] <%AncelDeLambert> this game is basically a modern sci-fi Lewis and Clarke expidition
[0:36:46] <+PirateMike_> Feel unnatural
[0:36:49] <+PirateMike_> s
[0:36:51] <holydeviant1> Gotta sit still to see/scan BTs @CptHarlok
[0:36:52] <beetbo2> @MrCheesyFondue I think they legit just game-over you. no repatriation
[0:36:54] <%marvel877> It helps to standstill to see the BTs.
[0:36:56] <+machshop> strando powah
[0:37:01] <%StaceMcGate> @MrCheesyFondue Norman is immortal and cannot die. When BTs get you, you respawn but you'll get a low grade on your mission
[0:37:07] <+machshop> monkaS
[0:37:12] <SquigglyLizard> LUL
[0:37:13] <Neathergrasp> can you scare away bts by pissing on them?
[0:37:17] <%AncelDeLambert> who left the ropes?
[0:37:18] <holydeviant1> YES
[0:37:20] <devanmuse> when did you get blood bullets?
[0:37:21] <CptHarlok> @holydeviant1 Well, that would explain it. I've nearly beaten the game and did not know that.
[0:37:22] <+AndeOneNine> @Neathergrasp Actually yes
[0:37:24] <holydeviant1> YOU CAN PISS ON THE GHOSTS DIRECTLY
[0:37:25] <Mendin> Oh that is a good rope, m ash like
[0:37:27] <sackerkappa> What happens if a BT attacks you while you're climbing or using a ladder?
[0:37:27] <Ajanimentorofheros> Wait, did you void out? @angriestpat
[0:37:31] <+PirateMike_> @AncelDeLambert the ghosts
[0:37:34] <%ShichiNoBushi> Soon.
[0:37:43] <%StaceMcGate> blud bullets

[0:39:27] <alwayspronking> Is there a downside to just punking every ghost you find with blood grenades?
[0:39:27] <%narusao> chewing is for sissies apatElmo
[0:39:31] <%ShichiNoBushi> Ghost bondage.
[0:39:32] <+J_PewPew> it makes it harder to get at the food so it slows them down
[0:39:34] <pamtheundieing> make a puzzle bowl for the food
[0:39:35] <%THATGUY_789> throws it up then eats it again
[0:39:36] <%logoth_> This game has combat?
[0:39:38] <%BoboDaHobo> he might have developed an esophageal pocket
[0:39:44] <Mendin> @alwayspronking You kinda have to fill them with blood/bloodbags
[0:39:44] <%valriot> @alwayspronking Yeah you're own blood, or blood pack reserves
[0:39:46] <ExpressNode> I have a problem where I eat too fast also. I can relate to that
[0:39:50] <sackerkappa> The BT wants to mess with the cum cargo.
[0:39:52] <%FrostMass22> The worst part of Undertale is that Undyne ends up with Alphys
[0:39:52] <Ahk_90> Some combat now and then
[0:39:52] <holydeviant1> @alwayspronking not really, but I always find I miss the one that catches me
[0:39:54] <%StaceMcGate> Which Chaos God would influence over-eating? Slaneesh?
[0:39:59] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> It does
[0:40:00] <viredae> Are you delivering shoes?
[0:40:03] <alwayspronking> cool, thanks!
[0:40:04] <Neathergrasp> did they keep the stink status from phantom pain?
[0:40:06] <luchyninja> If you put the food on a flat cookie sheet he can’t eat as fast.
[0:40:07] <Calek> game has combat
[0:40:07] <%Tucker0603> @angriestpat I know there's food bowls with pillars in them for dogs to slow down their eating, you could look into a. cat one for the baby elmo
[0:40:07] <%ShichiNoBushi> Norman Greedus
[0:40:07] <+Weeewer> i mean it definitely has combat
[0:40:08] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Theyre boss battles
[0:40:08] <sirrice77> @alwayspronking other than being time consuming and requiring a ton of grenades, no
[0:40:08] <Angry_Ev1L> game has great combat
[0:40:11] <+Walopoh> Only in the technical sense
[0:40:11] <+Weeewer> its just not frequent
[0:40:13] <%drabberfaun535> @StaceMcGate yeah that would be exsess
[0:40:16] <Dragovus> @AngriestPat are you and Paige gonna stream The Game Awards this year?

[0:40:18] <+x24sonic> it has more combat later on
[0:40:19] <%logoth_> Optimize that load
[0:40:19] <%marvel877> kinda. its not worth it to stay for a fight, though.

[0:40:51] <CptHarlok> shit, piss, and blood grenades make me think Kojima's played a bit of Binding of Isaac.
[0:40:51] <+AndeOneNine> Second time Pat optimized load today
[0:40:53] <Mendin> That river is like pat: Tiny but secretly very violent
[0:40:53] <%valriot> Game actually has good combat, the game world just exists in a state where killing is BIG WIPEOUTS
[0:40:56] <holydeviant1> yeah @AngriestPat the rivers around here are Real Shit
[0:40:59] <%StaceMcGate> that was like a two inch creek

[0:43:03] <%GarbageNirvana> This is why you wash your package, Pat
[0:43:07] <%UberKingKai> It shrinks by the second
[0:43:10] <%ShichiNoBushi> Why isn't there a poncho in this game. I would figure an item like that would be crucial in a setting like this.
[0:43:14] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> @AngriestPat How far are you on that Highway?
[0:43:16] <CelioHogane> 2

[0:44:05] <%PinkSuprende> Pat the container condition does not matter for the delivery, just the actual condition
[0:44:06] <+Walopoh> That spray was also cum
[0:44:07] <%StaceMcGate> Freebreeze your cum and pizza before delivery
[0:44:10] <%valriot> Spray your "package" with Axe before you deliver it
[0:44:22] <%Anime_Flux> Have you done any more pizza deliveries off camera, Pat?
[0:44:23] <Ion_Laser> Gotta spray that package and it's good to go
[0:44:24] <%logoth_> Its not come its BB juice
[0:44:25] <aeonicvector> never spray your package with axe
[0:44:25] <+Sxy_T_Rex> How many points do you get for doing wicked stunts?
[0:44:27] <jon651> does the container repair spray reverse time?
[0:44:31] <%Keyd00d> those strands are locations
[0:44:31] <$DocMadfox> Cheer500 Hey Pat, do you think Paige running into the wall may have something to do with why she thought a plastic bag was Elmo? Also watching your old VoDs you had a donator named SpecOpsBear. I know that guy, I used to play in his 4E group! He thought I was black because my girlfriend at the time was half black and he didn't even consider the fact a white dude could date a black girl.

[0:46:32] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> It makes me cry like onions
[0:46:34] <Mikers29> why do they have garbo connection in their own base
[0:46:34] <+loukemia83> have they explained this dumb bullshit?
[0:46:36] <+Walopoh> What if tech just becomes what we know as magic
[0:46:42] <%JustToWatch> magic and nanomachines
[0:46:42] <+PenmanLupine> all of this magic just to plug in a cat 9 ethernet cable to the wall
[0:46:43] <Zomner> drone :O
[0:46:43] <old_dog_god> Delivering Chiral Cum, straight to your door

[0:46:52] <PinkSocks> Carriers are the BEST

[0:47:01] <+VektorTroika> Route 66 TWO
[0:47:04] <holydeviant1> @loukemia83 The Beach has differently-working time, but routing INTERNET through it you get perfect super-fiber
[0:47:04] <%marvel877> hoverboard time.
[0:47:08] <DocMadfox> Grenades are just Fireball spells if you think about it
[0:47:10] <%PROUD2beGINGER> fuck me
[0:47:12] <%rytisone> viewpoint synchronized
[0:47:15] <Shwepie> Wait, Pat is only on Chapter 3 and only just got the Floating Carrier? limesD
[0:47:15] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat BOTW SKATEBOARDING!
[0:47:17] <Crashtronaut> HOVERBOARD baby
[0:47:17] <+x24sonic> surf that shit down the mountain!!!
[0:47:23] <%valriot> technically this game is Bloodborne 2
[0:47:27] <beetbo2> SO HERE I AM
[0:47:30] <Fujiwara_92> weatherstone the weather man OpieOP
[0:47:30] <%Anime_Flux> hai gurl
[0:47:31] <rathom2ndgig> skateboarding mailman
[0:47:32] <Shwepie> I knew Pat would get super distracted and I love him for it. limesLove
[0:47:33] <%AncelDeLambert> big upgrade
[0:47:35] <$FluffiTamamo> Enjoy the worlds most annoying new material
[0:47:36] <+x24sonic> @valriot technically, yes
[0:47:36] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> a Good old reach around
[0:47:37] <+Walopoh> -said some guy that will let you down
[0:47:41] <holydeviant1> All the NPC names are hilarious
[0:47:42] <$FluffiTamamo> Fuck alloy...
[0:47:44] <%Rumbutt> That sounds great
[0:47:45] <agumon9000> That...doesn't sound good
[0:47:48] <agumon9000> Why do you want that
[0:47:50] <devanmuse> is the fucking magic chiral network stuff the reason why it's raining time all over the place?
[0:47:52] <+NitronStreams> This game is Beyond Two Souls 2
[0:47:54] <Moonlight_Grimoire> no it does not sound good at all
[0:47:58] <%THATGUY_789> does she ever wash her clothes
[0:48:00] <%Ner234> The Beach is fucky. That doesn't sound good.
[0:48:01] <Neathergrasp> where is diehard?
[0:48:03] <%Fenrirlives> did Pat meet Mama in person yet?
[0:48:04] <AmericanaRed> MOMMA Kreygasm
[0:48:09] <%Anime_Flux> Alexa, what's the weather today?
[0:48:15] <%Ixiah> ever heard of fiber optic internet
[0:48:17] <agumon9000> Does the normal internet just not work anymore?
[0:48:19] <Zomner> Weather app acquired 👍
[0:48:19] <M4eta> have you met her in person?
[0:48:20] <Dingo_Eejit> fjdjdjgkgkzkajajsjdjjfjjfjjdjjdjsjsjjdjjdjjsjfkgodkqkajdjfkff boy mobile devices suck shit
[0:48:23] <%UberKingKai> Ayyy
[0:48:25] <%ShichiNoBushi> Blanka: "Maaama!"
[0:48:26] <pi_in_the_sci> He hasn't
[0:48:27] <Mikers29> I beat the game but I never could get it to show me the weather so I must be a idiot
[0:48:28] <%Keyd00d> Sam. This is Die-hardman
[0:48:36] <+Sxy_T_Rex> It's Lethalweapondude
[0:48:37] <+TekkieX> Mama meet up is in the next chapter
[0:48:40] <old_dog_god> “Alexa, how much jugdment nut is in the atmosphere today?”
[0:48:41] <%TeaJayGee> why does he wear the mask?
[0:48:41] <MrCheesyFondue> So what do timefalls do to the average person/object? Is anyone that is not a repatriate just gets fucked by timefall rain?
[0:48:42] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Predict that weather Patron
[0:48:42] <%logoth_> Pee Pee Poo Poo Man
[0:48:49] <%Maids4lyfe> weather forecast, partly cloudy with a chance of ghosts
[0:48:53] <%Ner234> Where is Live-softman?
[0:48:57] <+VektorTroika> Jumbo Stumbo Man
[0:48:59] <Shwepie> @AngriestPat Thoughts so far on make number go up game?
[0:48:59] <Ajanimentorofheros> Are the chiral clouds stopping radio waves for the internet?
[0:48:59] <%ShichiNoBushi> Look at these photographs...!
[0:49:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> @agumon9000 Maintenance is hard when it rains time all over the damn place. Most materials don't like time.
[0:49:04] <Fluguhad> It’s die guy
[0:49:08] <%StaceMcGate> AMERICA IS WHOLE
[0:49:11] <old_dog_god> Live-Softman is BB
[0:49:17] <holydeviant1> Chiral Clouds are apparently a huge pain in the ass for ANYTHING passing through them
[0:49:18] <cinless> but pccs are super useful!
[0:49:19] <Teyaric> But why did you sea-snail'd it?
[0:49:20] <aeonicvector> @MrCheesyFondue just about anything gets fucked by timefall, repatriates in non-resistant clothing included
[0:49:24] <%StaceMcGate> Sam, as you know
[0:49:33] <%TeaJayGee> dead mom-man
[0:49:35] <agumon9000> I mean you can just do underground lines for the most part. Timefall doesn't affect underground as it just becomes normal water once it hits the surface.
[0:49:38] <dukenux> Live Sofskullman
[0:49:38] <@Fuggins4U> man this is a swanky interface
[0:49:39] <beetbo2> As you know, Sam
[0:49:41] <Neathergrasp> i can't believe anyone can talk with diehard without giggling
[0:49:44] <%thebiganxiety> Pussy breaker man
[0:49:44] <agumon9000> It would take a lot of time to set up but normal internet could work
[0:49:46] <%marvel877> and then they literally give you a PCC for the next order.
[0:49:49] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> How many stars does he got?
[0:49:53] <Moonlight_Grimoire> timefall shelters are so nice
[0:50:01] <%honeyman18> honeyman18 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Happy 2 months subscribed to Pat. Also, I had a nightmare that the automated checkouts came with a pay by blood option and you had to force an arm in to pay for food, your own or anyone else's. Happy nightmare fuel.
[0:50:02] <%ShichiNoBushi> They also emit Repair Spray.
[0:50:06] <%rytisone> should be shortcut key to skip cutscnes like in Bayonetta
[0:50:06] <Mikers29> they also repair cargo but no need to add that
[0:50:07] <themightyseptopus> if you never skipped the delivery animation I wonder how much playtime it would add up too?
[0:50:13] <%Anime_Flux> breaking that 4th wall
[0:50:13] <Teyaric> Shelter is a straight replacement/upgrade for Repair Spray, then?
[0:50:14] <rarovan> How's UPS the game?
[0:50:20] <Isord> The map is going to explode with shelters right now
[0:50:24] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat This game has the worst codec ringtones. Die-Hardman's is especially the most egregious
[0:50:37] <%PinkSuprende> You cant build outside the chiral network so you still need spray when moving into new areas
[0:50:39] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Most defintely
[0:50:49] <%PinkSuprende> Or if you run out of bandwidth for structures
[0:50:50] <%Omegaanimus> HOVER CART!
[0:50:57] <%Omegaanimus> You can ride it like a skateboard!
[0:51:00] <Moonlight_Grimoire> the floating carrier is basically a skateboard
[0:51:01] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> CHOOO CHOo
[0:51:03] <%xtremegamer80> CART ON CART
[0:51:04] <ThirdPersonPhil> So it floats because of ghost energy
[0:51:05] <%THATGUY_789> so it pays to be slow playing as others beat the game for you
[0:51:06] <Conky89> Really really
[0:51:07] <PinkSocks> It's so good easily my favorite item in the game
[0:51:07] <%marvel877> it doesnt drain as fast as youd think it would.
[0:51:07] <%xtremegamer80> TRAIN CARTS
[0:51:08] <+Walopoh> TRAIN TIME
[0:51:08] <aeonicvector> you can also DOWNHILL JAM WITH IT
[0:51:09] <%Anime_Flux> this really is fucking Oregon Trail
[0:51:11] <+PirateMike_> Pat Train
[0:51:13] <MrCheesyFondue> Thats some parade balloon shit!
[0:51:14] <%honeyman18> Skating downhill is fun
[0:51:14] <%Rumbutt> Norman Reedus Pro Porter 3
[0:51:17] <+dante_must_die_exe> skateboards? LUL
[0:51:18] <+Walopoh> SPIRIT TRACKS
[0:51:20] <%Omegaanimus> Time to bust out some sick downhill skating!
[0:51:22] <SpaceGuntank> it functions as a skateboard if there isnt any cargo on it
[0:51:25] <%rytisone> CHOO CHOO MOFOS
[0:51:25] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> CHuggaa Chugga
[0:51:27] <%StaceMcGate> So here I am, doing everything I can
[0:51:29] <beetbo2> All aboard the hover Pat train
[0:51:30] <Teyaric> Oh my god of course you can SKATE ON IT. XD
[0:51:32] <+PirateMike_> Patron has become the Pattrain
[0:51:33] <%marvel877> they don't hardly drain.
[0:51:35] <tigerfang86> for BIG BOYS
[0:51:35] <Teyaric> Goddamnit, Kojima
[0:51:37] <Moonlight_Grimoire> They are also just nice to have one on hand
[0:51:37] <%Omegaanimus> fuck the deliveries, skate!
[0:51:37] <holydeviant1> Never used the floaters myself
[0:51:39] <%valriot> @angriestpat Get one and skate on it
[0:51:41] <+MajorCrasher> make a floating carrier
[0:51:47] <Mendin> Timefarm
[0:51:49] <@Fuggins4U> yeet that wheet
[0:51:49] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Empty carts also double as hoverboards
[0:51:51] <%AnIrishPapaya> Can you attach it to a bike?
[0:51:53] <%Tucker0603> skateboard dat shit
[0:51:53] <Fujiwara_92> weed
[0:51:54] <satans_finest_millennial> i really enjoyed your space wizard stream yesterday. i hope you do more
[0:51:58] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Reminds me of Alan wake
[0:52:00] <holydeviant1> Timefall farm is both stupid and amazingly practical
[0:52:01] <%THATGUY_789> Tergridy Farms
[0:52:02] <$FluffiTamamo> The rate of use is so nonexistent you may as well pretend it doesn’t.
[0:52:03] <Shwepie> How much food can you grow if you abuse Timefall?
[0:52:06] <%ShichiNoBushi> The concept behind the Timefall Farm is great.
[0:52:08] <%PinkSuprende> the Hover Carrier is for on foot only
[0:52:14] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat I mean....if you know what to do...Wouldn't time fall make growing crops really easy? You could get a full harvest in a few minutes.
[0:52:17] <+StrawberryPantsu> Weed?
[0:52:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SKATEBOARD TIME
[0:52:19] <%StaceMcGate> What the hell does MULES stand for?
[0:52:20] <+x24sonic> you really don't need a ladder for this delivery
[0:52:21] <Mikers29> this is a farm for food Sam so they need 3 containers of Semen
[0:52:28] <aeonicvector> ride it downhill
[0:52:33] <%Laecerelius> So you use the time fall to grow the wheat super fast?
[0:52:39] <%TheStarvingGood> take one to ride it
[0:52:44] <%honeyman18> The Farmers are great
[0:52:44] <mondumbra> weed
[0:52:45] <%marvel877> yep
[0:52:45] <arkv01> I am proud to be here for the birth of a new language
[0:52:49] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Get HUGE
[0:52:51] <%honeyman18> also decoy farm
[0:53:00] <%Ixiah> why the hell isnt die hard man not out there and helping connecting ?
[0:53:05] <%logoth_> So if all rain is time juice where does drinking water come from
[0:53:07] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Is it ever explained why Sam needs to transport seamen? I mean, did all men stop jacking off?
[0:53:07] <%valriot> Timefall farm is so interesting, boost your crop growth by 600%
[0:53:08] <wannabemoogle> Upgraded the smartwatch handcuff
[0:53:08] <%marvel877> only works for the connected areas
[0:53:08] <%supercasualboom> Cuff links...I see what they did there.
[0:53:11] <+NitronStreams> Hey you got the Intel Platform... oh wait wrong game
[0:53:22] <%ShichiNoBushi> Annoying that you can't plot routes on the forecast mode.
[0:53:25] <%StaceMcGate> Sam, as you know, big number > big combo
[0:53:32] <cinless> it took me 75 hours to beat this game
[0:53:34] <%king_wragles> Nothing sets up a dystopia like simple things such as knowing what the weather will be, end up being such a huge deal.
[0:53:35] <Teyaric> ..... They're... Just handcuffs because "Cuff LINKS" arent they.
[0:53:48] <+AndeOneNine> @Teyaric ye
[0:53:50] <CelioHogane> @Teyaric yes
[0:53:51] <%AnIrishPapaya> But it's weather reporting, so it's like 45% accurate
[0:53:52] <+x24sonic> ride the carrier down the hill!!!!!
[0:53:56] <+Javaa01> Yeah, looking at the map, seems like the MULE camp is right next to that Watchtower you mapped
[0:54:00] <agumon9000> I got a gun
[0:54:03] <agumon9000> no girls
[0:54:06] <%honeyman18> genetic diversity in closed off populations, it was donated semen and eggs. meaning someone went and collected 25kg of sperm
[0:54:08] <DocMadfox> And I just started blastin'
[0:54:08] <beetbo2> SO I BLASTED EM
[0:54:10] <Conky89> This would probably take me over 100 hours to beat since I am the type of guy who likes to take time playing games.
[0:54:12] <Fujiwara_92> G U N
[0:54:15] <Neathergrasp> chiral poisoming increases the nutriens in semen
[0:54:20] <%xtremegamer80> REAL TIME WEATHER
[0:54:20] <mondumbra> in Spanish you would them las Mulas
[0:54:21] <wicketpelican> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck yeah people are living in isolated communities so sperm transport is good for DNA diversification. It literaly explains in the mission you do it.
[0:54:23] <%supercasualboom> Follow the footprints and fighting them to make armor...wait...
[0:54:27] <devanmuse> So anyway, I just started BLASTING
[0:54:35] <%ShichiNoBushi> They are locked down to certain areas, but it comes and goes in some.
[0:54:39] <ThunderJim> What chapter are you on?
[0:54:39] <+Walopoh> why else include a weather guy character?
[0:54:42] <+kraajkase> It's a bit of both I think
[0:54:43] <%StaceMcGate> I'm on the Death Stranding Wiki and even it doesn't tell me what MULEs stands for
[0:54:48] <%valriot> "Real time weather" wooaahhOOOAAHHHHHHHHH"
[0:54:56] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Kind of, it’s a mix.
[0:54:56] <agumon9000> MULEs
[0:54:57] <%Anime_Flux> You don't tell ME what to do, DieHardMan
[0:55:02] <agumon9000> Stand for
[0:55:02] <pamtheundieing> its a play on pack mules
[0:55:06] <bloomingzonda> You can also make a great Aioli with 25 kg of semen
[0:55:07] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @wicketpelican Ohh okay that explains alot. Still gross
[0:55:09] <pth88> How was star wars last night, did Pat like it?
[0:55:10] <agumon9000> MULEs like the donkey that holds stuff
[0:55:11] <FrankysDream> @AngriestPat some areas always have rain and some areas never have rain, and some areas have changing weather
[0:55:17] <+x24sonic> speaking of real time weather i was actually hugely surprised that there's no day/night cycle in this game whatsoever
[0:55:18] <Conky89> Damn that guy looks THICC
[0:55:21] <%PaladinDupre> A M B U S H
[0:55:21] <%reddpop_> timefall shelters are the dopest shit. cargo recovery spray built in is apatBig
[0:55:22] <aeonicvector> its for you to practice kickflips
[0:55:23] <@Fuggins4U> why isnt he grabbing mushrooms?
[0:55:25] <%mield916> I just got most of the explanation of the DS in-game.
[0:55:32] <%ShichiNoBushi> Keh-rahm-ics
[0:55:32] <%Laecerelius> New Star Wars game seems real neato
[0:55:33] <agumon9000> Shut the fuck up Heartman
[0:55:33] <Mikers29> diehardman Micro-mange's Sam so freaking much. does he have nothing else to do. like clean his dumb skull face
[0:55:44] <DocMadfox> Hhhhoooomans
[0:55:44] <%StaceMcGate> @agumon9000 but when it's in all caps that would infer that it is an acronym
[0:55:45] <TikanZK> ok nerd
[0:55:45] <%Ner234> ONLY HUMANS
[0:55:47] <%reddpop_> @Fuggins4U they're holo mushrooms
[0:55:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> @reddpop_ Now if only work on vroom vroom.
[0:55:51] <%honeyman18> what is a human, asks the weatherman
[0:55:54] <%SaiyanShoto> I swear that sounds like Harry Potter
[0:55:55] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Yes ONLY HUMANS not birds. and most animals
[0:55:56] <%valriot> Eat shit, robots
[0:55:59] <%TeaJayGee> Is there any explanation of why the american terrain looks like Iceland?
[0:55:59] <%xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat Sometimes that prediction is wrong
[0:56:01] <%This_is_Marco> @Fuggins4U the mushrooms just make the little healing bug thingies
[0:56:02] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat did you meet Heartman in person? i never saw his cutscene
[0:56:06] <wannabemoogle> God we get it science man
[0:56:06] <agumon9000> Heartman shut the fuck up
[0:56:06] <%StaceMcGate> I'm Shaved Testicle-Man
[0:56:07] <Ahk_90> yes we know Pat
[0:56:09] <+bigboyeggo> wow that doesn't sound evil at all
[0:56:09] <@Fuggins4U> ahh
[0:56:09] <lyzejag> Yeah that's why you use the chiral network that is gonna destroy the fucking world
[0:56:10] <DocMadfox> But only HHhhhhoooomans
[0:56:15] <%Anime_Flux> No one cares, Heartman
[0:56:15] <@commanderclaw> I disagree, focusing on the future will make you miserable
[0:56:16] <%PaladinDupre> Shoulda brought the bike
[0:56:16] <%valriot> Hindsightman
[0:56:17] <+VektorTroika> Fedora-Tipman
[0:56:18] <PinkSocks> Heartman is great can't wait for Pat to get to him
[0:56:19] <cinless> heartman's head is so far up his own ass he singes his nose hairs when he shocks his heart
[0:56:19] <Moonlight_Grimoire> this slope is why you would have wanted the carrier, because you could skate down it
[0:56:28] <Isord> Should have made a bike
[0:56:31] <%ShichiNoBushi> Mama is apparently near South Knot. I haven't met her yet.
[0:56:33] <beetbo2> PROPHECY-HINDSIGHT MAN
[0:56:34] <%xtremegamer80> That's a South Park character
[0:56:34] <%Ner234> You've met very few people in person.
[0:56:35] <agumon9000> You shoulda brought a trike
[0:56:36] <lyzejag> Heartman is very funny somehow
[0:56:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> Use a death crystal to see the future even harder
[0:56:39] <ScreamLord> This would have been a great spot to use the Hover Cart
[0:56:40] <%valriot> "Didn't know what you were messin with, Sam'
[0:56:41] <ThirdPersonPhil> why didnt you brought your skateboard bro

[1:05:22] <%honeyman18> Pro tip, Deliver the beer to remove monster forever
[1:05:23] <%StaceMcGate> Reedus is very important to the plot, but he talks about as Venom Snake did during cutscenes
[1:05:24] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> CUM and get it!
[1:05:24] <%reddpop_> timefall farm seems OP
[1:05:25] <+ClaudeMcGarren> how does a timefall farm work?
[1:05:27] <Demon_chann> yeah
[1:05:28] <+loukemia83> Wouldn't the time fall kill the crops?
[1:05:29] <+bigboyeggo> welp i gotta head out, this hour was fun though <3
[1:05:29] <lyzejag> Weaponizing the timefall seems dangerous
[1:05:33] <%Omegaanimus> Pat, look at the boxes
[1:05:34] <Shwepie> @hydroarsonist69 He turned 50, his second career is just getting started.
[1:05:35] <CelioHogane> Oh shit an NPC woman!
[1:05:37] <CriminalMasterminds> frick did I miss any story stuff?
[1:05:38] <%GarbageNirvana> That's how you make lemons outta lemonade

[1:05:40] <tr00ly_> what chapter is this
[1:05:42] <lyzejag> Ha and hello Adamn Jensen
[1:05:43] <+JFKRobot> @AngriestPat Is this all the dumb bullshit you hoped it'd be?
[1:05:44] <%GarbageNirvana> Or no the other way
[1:05:48] <tigerfang86> SPEED farm
[1:05:51] <+x24sonic> JENSEN
[1:05:55] <sasparillatango> once the crop is ready you put up umbrellas to cover it from aging
[1:05:55] <%nofestu2> well I'LL BE
[1:05:55] <tigerfang86> SPEEEEED farming
[1:05:58] <cinless> by the way AngriestPat you and woolie laughed at kojima for the MULE thing, but that kind of dopamine cycle addiction is actually a real thing, and kind of a possible future result of amazon trying to pay people with a dopamine cycle rather than actual money
[1:05:59] <MrDonTacos_> speedrun farm
[1:06:00] <%Omegaanimus> it's a brewery
[1:06:00] <%ShichiNoBushi> "This rain accelerators time. Let's abuse it to grow food faster."
[1:06:01] <%StaceMcGate> This farm produces Monster at 10,000x the rate as a normal factory
[1:06:03] <Mendin> Presumably you engineer Really Slow Growing Crops so that with the timefall it balances out a little?
[1:06:07] <%thebiganxiety> Who’re these guys?
[1:06:08] <+NitronStreams> GOTTA SPEEDRUN THAT CORN
[1:06:09] <@commanderclaw> Couldn't you use timefall to make a fetus grow fast?
[1:06:12] <%Laecerelius> Fucking Minecraft farm
[1:06:13] <+ClaudeMcGarren> strongest and dumbest is correct
[1:06:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> @stacemcgate To be fair, they established that Sam is an antisocial git with a severe physical contact phobia, so it makes sense that he talks as little as possible.
[1:06:22] <%Meow0369> @AngriestPat for the love of everything read the donation message
[1:06:22] <ThirdPersonPhil> is the max payne face guy in this game?

[1:06:24] <MrDonTacos_> LUL
[1:06:24] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Tractorville speedrunners know all about this.
[1:06:24] <TikanZK> Wait so its just holograms running the farm right? Or am I missing something
[1:06:24] <%logoth_> Electrify the fence so the corn doesnt escape

[1:06:48] <Perfect_Jehuty> Adam Jensen?
[1:06:50] <Teyaric> @TikanZK Everything is post-apocalypse shelter, everyone is disconnected, everything is done through video screens
[1:06:52] <%honeyman18> The Death Stranding is just someone buying premium time boosters for the earth Phone Game.
[1:07:09] <%StaceMcGate> @CommanderSqueaks It is still awkward when people bear their soul or something bonkers happens and Sam does not react at all
[1:07:09] <TikanZK> @Teyaric ah kk, thanks
[1:07:10] <SpaceGuntank> i wonder if you can observe the Timefall farm in real time??
[1:07:11] <%This_is_Marco> @meow0369 he reads them at the beginning and end of streams. Or occasionally during a break
[1:07:11] <%ShichiNoBushi> At this point, you are more limited by physical size than weight for how much you can carry.
[1:07:11] <superd4v3> I think that's the VA for Adam Jensen @AngriestPat
[1:07:12] <agumon9000> How much must Sam's neck hurt from constantly and violently RIPPING off the Q-Pid from his neck

[1:10:08] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Also with like cross breading and GMO you can give plants genes of other plants that live like hundreds of years
[1:10:09] <tigerfang86> thanks diehardman
[1:10:10] <arkv01> yeah but what if timefall is a GMO
[1:10:10] <Neathergrasp> do you have any character you want back in guilty gear 2020? i hope jam returns
[1:10:11] <%Rumbutt> Time for beer
[1:10:11] <+Javaa01> Also, with the Timefall accelerating crop production, it gives parasites and other crop diseases significantly less time to bite, which means you need much less fumigation
[1:10:11] <hydroarsonist69> i hate that skull mask
[1:10:16] <%ShichiNoBushi> I realized some time ago that if you nuked a city, there wouldn't be as many BTs as you would expect as most of the bodies at the epicenter would be vaporized. Though those that are just enough outside of it would instead die of radiation eventually.
[1:10:19] <%honeyman18> UNLOCKED BEER
[1:10:22] <%Who_lio42> time for porters porter
[1:10:28] <%Rumbutt> See all that beer Pat?

[1:10:32] <Fujiwara_92> BEER Pog
[1:10:33] <Solidus_113> replace monster energy with beer
[1:10:40] <%Omegaanimus> You have to deliver the beer to one of the stations to unlock
[1:10:41] <%Meow0369> @Javaa01 it would kill all parasites, you'd need literally no fumigation
[1:10:44] <Big_King_Coconut> elmo says the same thing about pat
[1:10:46] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Yeah but it's also a pillow that throws up.
[1:10:48] <mayorrev> Has he unlocked beer?

[1:12:50] <+griffball13> BEER RUN BOYZ
[1:12:50] <%Who_lio42> what pisses me off is this game early on has a moment where die-hardman goes "lets not get into that right now" IN A KOJIMA GAME
[1:12:51] <Mendin> You got a Trukk
[1:12:51] <%StaceMcGate> Backtrack-Man

[1:13:12] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Did pat do any of the highway?
[1:13:13] <ExpressNode> What's to stop those mules from raiding all that shit

[1:13:19] <tigerfang86> C A R
[1:13:20] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 13m.
[1:13:22] <%Meow0369> That vehicle has almost NO power btw
[1:13:22] <%nofestu2> LUL its a porter
[1:13:23] <Arksword> Why would you want beer when you can have Monster™?
[1:13:23] <%FrostMass22> @who_lio42 The game opens with a million questions and so far none have been answered
[1:13:25] <DocMadfox> Yay for stealing cars
[1:13:26] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat Why would they name a beverage after a life-consuming catastrophe?
[1:13:27] <wannabemoogle> Oh look a tractor
[1:13:27] <%Meow0369> it'll run out of power nearly instantly
[1:13:36] <+Evergreen_45> maybe they bribe the mules with beer
[1:13:36] <+MajorCrasher> it'll run out of battery before you get there
[1:13:39] <tigerfang86> PREMIUM RUSH
[1:13:40] <%TeaJayGee> what would happen if you placed a baby in timefall? Would it age normally, or would it turn into an "old" baby with wrinkles?
[1:13:43] <Big_King_Coconut> time to roll out the barrel
[1:13:47] <%Meow0369> That car is gonna run out of battery at like the mule camp lol
[1:13:48] <agumon9000> GET THOSE LIKES PATT
[1:13:49] <%PipIV> EXPEDITE THAT SHIT
[1:13:50] <tiaramaki> Any way you can charge the truck's battery?
[1:13:52] <HuskyluvrMC> djkeo why did I just get notified I missed so much... Im gonna watch the vod on this one sorry
[1:13:53] <+NitronStreams> shenanigans ensue
[1:13:53] <mayorrev> Premium Deliveries are special?
[1:13:57] <%StaceMcGate> Deliver beer to get more Edgar Wright movies
[1:14:07] <%Meow0369> @tiaramaki normal generator, but the mule cars have basically no battery capacity regardless
[1:14:11] <+Javaa01> I doubt it
[1:14:11] <TrollKing96> @AngriestPat There was a MULE postbox you passed by disguised as a rock.
[1:14:13] <hydroarsonist69> kojima was inspired by his time as a doordash courier
[1:14:14] <%Maids4lyfe> mule trucks have shit tier batteries
[1:14:16] <+Evergreen_45> Prime* Delivery
[1:14:17] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Once you get the hang of parking at the door you can load up directly onto the truck.
[1:14:17] <%SomeSageAdvice> doubtful
[1:14:18] <+Link232> I mean there's a second truck there, somewhere
[1:14:18] <%Maids4lyfe> they run out of juice fast
[1:14:20] <%This_is_Marco> Mule trucks are kinda bad
[1:14:20] <%PipIV> I bet 69 likes
[1:14:21] <Ted_the_red> nah but you're gonna have a hard time when you get to the rocky area
[1:14:21] <+x24sonic> there is almost certainly a nearby generator
[1:14:21] <Fujiwara_92> I don't think you will
[1:14:23] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat I'll say you won't run out
[1:14:23] <Big_King_Coconut> I bet pat gets eaten by a BT
[1:14:24] <%rytisone> It sure would be funny
[1:14:27] <%valriot> Not if my structures are outside the farm now
[1:14:29] <mayorrev> How can you check vehicle battery?
[1:14:30] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Patt we know you have have PCC and can just make a generator
[1:14:32] <devanmuse> i mean, knowing YOUR luck?
[1:14:33] <Moonlight_Grimoire> well now that he's connected to the network there is likely a gen somewhere
[1:14:39] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat What do I get if I win?
[1:14:39] <+PenmanLupine> steal their shit!
[1:14:39] <%Meow0369> Have fun running out of battery :3
[1:14:42] <wannabemoogle> What ever i will pick will be wrong
[1:14:44] <%keyworthe> vehicle battery is behind pat
[1:14:45] <+PenmanLupine> steal everything they've got!
[1:14:45] <+griffball13> you should steal there shit on the way
[1:14:46] <%Maids4lyfe> it's the meter on the bottom of the screen @mayorrev
[1:14:47] <+Javaa01> You've got plenty of juice, and a PCC, so you can just juice it up if it runs dry
[1:14:47] <%keyworthe> he blocking it
[1:14:50] <PinkSocks> just make a generator
[1:14:52] <mayorrev> ah ok
[1:14:52] <deathsmions1> Fulton the haters
[1:14:55] <%valriot> @angriestpat There's a generator right outside
[1:14:57] <lyzejag> Take a PCC PAt
[1:14:58] <Isord> take the riverside

[1:15:30] <%keyworthe> NOPE
[1:15:30] <Maxicqwe> do it as the wave comes to you
[1:15:32] <%PinkSuprende> Nope
[1:15:32] <agumon9000> Nope
[1:15:32] <Shwepie> They are all dead, Pat.
[1:15:34] <%honeyman18> I almost finished all the roads in my game and they're completely broken for deliveries.
[1:15:34] <Demon_chann> nope
[1:15:35] <%keyworthe> THEY'RE ALL OUT COLD MAN
[1:15:35] <+Link232> You KO'd everyone on the first way through
[1:15:38] <agumon9000> No one was around to notice you though
[1:15:39] <%Meow0369> but it wasn't an enemy pulse that was an area entrance pulse
[1:15:40] <%Maids4lyfe> no you didn't, the mules were outcold
[1:15:40] <%Keyd00d> you killed everyone
[1:15:41] <%Who_lio42> you gotta counter the ping that comes back to you, not the one that goes out
[1:15:41] <Ted_the_red> no you knocked out everyone so there was no return scan
[1:15:41] <+Kidkidd92> your wave has to meet their wave
[1:15:42] <Fujiwara_92> THEY'RE DEAD PAT
[1:15:43] <%StaceMcGate> all the MULEs are in deep coma from ball kicks
[1:15:48] <%PinkSuprende> It's not the proximity pulse it's the tracking pulse you need to deflect
[1:15:52] <+Javaa01> But you didn't steal their shit
[1:15:52] <Big_King_Coconut> oh pat, you are so silly
[1:15:53] <agumon9000> Is that a thunderstorm?
[1:15:54] <+OperatorPlease> oh damn, big truck
[1:15:55] <%Ixiah> watch them die in the timefall
[1:15:58] <%narusao> pat 1. pulse 0.

[1:16:56] <%Meow0369> Boost
[1:16:57] <Moonlight_Grimoire> truck won't recover from it, but, open top trucks have their cargo healed
[1:16:59] <%heazeus> Speed demon Redus
[1:17:03] <%supersugoisenpai1> You could build a recharge station
[1:17:04] <Mendin> Use the boost to get through
[1:17:08] <ExpressNode> This is real BIG RIGS
[1:17:08] <hydroarsonist69> pat is a fool and deserves to lose his truck
[1:17:09] <SpaceGuntank> truck is handling it pretty well
[1:17:13] <%Ixiah> endgame car: mako from mass effect 1
[1:17:13] <+MajorCrasher> you can speed boost in trucks
[1:17:15] <%ShichiNoBushi> We're truckin'.
[1:17:17] <%StaceMcGate> The pioneers used to ride these babies for miles
[1:17:17] <agumon9000> Black strands
[1:17:18] <+Javaa01> The shelters can fix everything on an open back truck like that, but not the truck itself
[1:17:19] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Just don’t click L3... yet.
[1:17:19] <Moonlight_Grimoire> also, might want to hit the weather station for more cago
[1:17:19] <Meekest> FOR AMERICA

[1:17:32] <DocMadfox> Truck for America, Pat!
[1:17:33] <%Who_lio42> if this was real BIG RIGS you would just drive backwards for infinite speed
[1:17:36] <black_pariah> I NEED MORE POWER
[1:17:36] <%Laecerelius> The Mako with a giant bola cannon
[1:17:37] <%Meow0369> You took the worst possible way with the truck

[1:18:09] <Conky89> Cat butt alert
[1:18:11] <%Meow0369> Might be worth using a pcc to build a generator just to charge it then dismantle it
[1:18:12] <%Who_lio42> are rivers just STRANDS?
[1:18:14] <%Ixiah> yeah what about that battery pat ? hm ? :D

[1:36:23] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat There was a free trike back there!
[1:36:33] <Cymen90> @MonstarGrrrl Dota 2 Gang
[1:36:35] <beetbo2> the death stranding made anime real
[1:36:45] <wannabemoogle> DIsney didn't survive the Apocalypse but the waifus did.
[1:36:48] <Demon_chann> hey pay i saw in twitter that you didnt knew about digimon fans being weirdos

[1:37:06] <Neathergrasp> i wonder if it hurts for fragile to take a shower?
[1:37:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this area
[1:37:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[1:37:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> fuck this area
[1:37:11] <+Loyks> both
[1:37:11] <%StaceMcGate> Monster and Anime survives the apocalypse and everyone lives alone in bunkers. Truly an Otaku paradise
[1:37:12] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Nice heavy skeleton. I hope nothing bad happens to it.
[1:37:13] <Isord> it is stupid
[1:37:13] <Demon_chann> nah i did the same
[1:37:13] <DocMadfox> @Demon_chann I think my donation last stream confirmed that for him well enough.
[1:37:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> starting out
[1:37:13] <+MajorCrasher> get a carrier
[1:37:15] <jewish_rabbi> It is
[1:37:17] <beetbo2> to familiarize with the area?
[1:37:18] <%Meow0369> This area is impossible not on foot
[1:37:19] <+MrFalco> it is not
[1:37:20] <goomba334> no it makes sense, esepcially bc this area is really rocky
[1:37:21] <%marvel877> Let him learn the harsh realities of the Wasteland.
[1:37:21] <%Meow0369> don't worry
[1:37:23] <haisho> hope you like crevices!
[1:37:23] <Isord> especially since its a timed mission
[1:37:28] <%Mekhet09> Build the highway.
[1:37:30] <%honeyman18> This whole area hurts my feet to look at.
[1:37:31] <Edible_Enthusiasm> good thing Pat is getting his virtual exercise today @-@
[1:37:37] <%Lost_Zombie> You can do every area on the bikes actually
[1:37:38] <%ShichiNoBushi> There's a hidden Prepper in this area, but he's in a cave you will have to repel into.
[1:37:43] <Demon_chann> @DocMadfox honestly i dont blame those desings are something else
[1:37:48] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat At least you are getting your steps in
[1:37:50] <%Scarnehu> better than liam's "jump every canyon" approach
[1:37:51] <%StaceMcGate> I'd pay top dollar for a stream of Ring Fit Adventure
[1:37:53] <agumon9000> A bridge should be good enough to cross them
[1:37:53] <%Mekhet09> It's a waste of time because the trip is flat but enjoy it.
[1:37:58] <agumon9000> not bridge, ladder
[1:38:13] <+griffball13> can you super jump with a lvl 3 exo?
[1:38:15] <%Meow0369> Sprint pat
[1:38:24] <%Mekhet09> No.

[1:38:30] <Kongro_> ... You can jump over the chasms
[1:38:31] <%Keyd00d> I got to most everywhere on this map with a bike
[1:38:32] <Calek> you can drive on ladders
[1:38:33] <Isord> you can jump them
[1:38:33] <%ShichiNoBushi> You can jump some of them.
[1:38:39] <Neathergrasp> do they scream sam in the game over screan?
[1:38:48] <lyzejag> JUMP
[1:38:55] <%Mekhet09> They're jumpable.
[1:38:56] <%PinkSuprende> On foot you can just double jump the chasms, it's great
[1:38:56] <b1gboss007> bikes can supee jumo tho

[1:48:55] <Mendin> Timefall is literally water + aging so it's big rust
[1:48:56] <%Bt_Robot> NASA uses this desert to test the Mars rover
[1:48:56] <%Keyd00d> You're in Oklahoma so it's red dirt
[1:48:56] <+Fynale> maybe it's an effect of timefalls?

[1:49:02] <dukenux> You gotta deliver Matt Damon to South Knot @AngriestPat
[1:49:03] <Dakuu75> I think it's suppose to be iron-deposites that have rusted over from time-fall
[1:49:06] <Isord> nooooooo thats how america is - kojima
[1:49:10] <PE4X> probably should be a fucked up grand canyonish thing?
[1:49:11] <%PipIV> all the iron oxidizing from timefall

[1:49:12] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat lol Paige breaking bird distracted you from the question: How do you rate the game thus far? :P

[1:49:34] <+MrFalco> the cars and scrap have been basically melted into rust dust by the time fall
[1:49:36] <dukenux> Yeah, but that's why Mars look like it, because all the iron in the soil, isn't it?
[1:49:38] <WeebFever> Like mars or whatever
[1:49:40] <wannabemoogle> Neat looking

[1:56:29] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Now that you said it and showed that you're self-aware, it's instantly not as bad
[1:56:30] <%R3Roundabout> Terrible schedules, but the degeneracy is a big part of the stream's appeal
[1:56:30] <%Omegaanimus> Have you considered it's your fanbase?
[1:56:34] <+MajorCrasher> the director is a total hipster
[1:56:36] <%dylin456> so is there no background music in this game or did pat turn it off

[1:57:36] <%marvel877> Have fun with the BTs.
[1:57:36] <Kongro_> @VariousOminousDrones It's good, but very easy for people that are used to Souls-like games.
[1:57:36] <+MajorCrasher> GET A CARRIER
[1:57:37] <Demon_chann> that new star wars looked like casual souls
[1:57:46] <VariousOminousDrones> @mayorrev nice one. I was playing it today and it's basically Sekiro but easy so I was curious.

[1:58:25] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Oh yeah this. I forgot. It’s simple. BTs are dumb.
[1:58:25] <Moonlight_Grimoire> take the rusted crap and throw it into the lake!
[1:58:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> goddammit

[1:58:31] <%marvel877> Pretty straighforward.
[1:58:33] <Hellarussian> why is everyone such a shit to Sam?
[1:58:36] <%keyworthe> love how sam talks to himself
[1:58:36] <collind99> @fenrirlives it’s more similar to new god of war
[1:58:43] <+keyoray> Sam did nothing wrong
[1:58:46] <%Fenrirlives> eugh
[1:58:46] <Guardiansaiyan> @Demon_chann thats why LP's were invented...for casual viewing
[1:58:53] <FirearmsInstructor> 315 kg = 693 lbs :O
[1:58:57] <%reddpop_> It's not personal, everyone is just an asshole
[1:58:57] <mayorrev> Chuck aint got shit on Frank
[1:58:59] <StripesUltimateEdition> strong boy
[1:58:59] <DocMadfox> Yeah but he deserves it
[1:59:00] <%keyworthe> we should be an asshole to pat and love sam
[1:59:00] <Guardiansaiyan> @AngriestPat did he deserve it tho?
[1:59:00] <masterfire23> can't wait for sams back to just give out at the end of this game
[1:59:01] <agumon9000> The apocalypse does that
[1:59:03] <+OperatorPlease> dead rising 2 stream confirmed?
[1:59:03] <h4nfr3d> @Moonlight_Grimoire on foot?
[1:59:03] <%Mekhet09> I have no idea why he ignored the carriers but it's a shitload of free space.
[1:59:04] <%logoth_> Can you spam "HEY" like you could in Disaster Report?
[1:59:06] <%cureneckbeard> Why does everyone in this city keep picking fights with us?
[1:59:06] <FirearmsInstructor> That's almost 1 whole Pat
[1:59:17] <Demon_chann> @Guardiansaiyan maybe i will watch pat vods of that
[1:59:17] <+SlashHabit> yes he did, he was ugly
[1:59:17] <mayorrev> Frank is cooler so who cares
[1:59:18] <Edible_Enthusiasm> @FirearmsInstructor Exoskellington c:
[1:59:22] <Guardiansaiyan> @masterfire23 there is an attachment for that
[1:59:22] <%thebiganxiety> Chuck was doing his best for his daughter tho
[1:59:23] <Conky89> Because video game PC
[1:59:25] <%Mekhet09> The mission after this is going to make him wish he had a carrier.
[1:59:27] <%thenumber5point5> spoilers on why
[1:59:30] <Mendin> Chuck Greene deserved it inasmuch as he was Well Framed By TJ
[1:59:30] <vonmaultke> Who the hell is Chuck Green?
[1:59:31] <+MrFalco> the carriers are super cool, you can build a train and it doesn't slow you down too bad for the extra load you get to carry
[1:59:32] <Guardiansaiyan> @Demon_chann best choice
[1:59:33] <Teyaric> Huh. Chiral drugs are apparently real, and coin-flip-tastic as to what effect they'll have. Due to mirroring?
[1:59:33] <CelioHogane> Beautiful?????
[1:59:33] <Dr_Mooose> oooooo
[1:59:35] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Welcome to Mars
[1:59:36] <mayorrev> B-Beautiful BibleThump
[1:59:36] <DocMadfox> He deserved it for not being Frank West (I'm kidding DR2 was my first and I liked Chuck Green)
[1:59:36] <yuribo26> Is it?
[1:59:37] <Hellarussian> ooooh aaaaaah
[1:59:37] <%thebiganxiety> I like chuck more than frank imo
[1:59:37] <%honeyman18> I wanna eat all the dirt.
[1:59:38] <Moonlight_Grimoire> that music cutting in
[1:59:38] <agumon9000> THAT IS WHAT HE CALLED BEAUTIFUL???

[2:02:23] <collind99> @angriestpat I find that Kojima is using the BTs in gameplay in a kinda similar way he used the Mist Unit in MGSV
[2:02:23] <Mendin> Fuck, we're in a chalice dungeon
[2:02:25] <%honeyman18> I think birthdates do change shit, my BT's almost never show up visualy.
[2:02:25] <CelioHogane> Oh shit, boss fight
[2:02:26] <dukenux> Cthulhu Dog
[2:02:28] <%keyworthe> this also gets rid of ALL the bt's in the area
[2:02:29] <DocMadfox> That's a giant goop doggo
[2:02:29] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Norman’s got a gun... so run away... run away from the pain.
[2:02:36] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Time to defeat it with the power of seamen
[2:02:37] <%Tucker0603> DEAD DOG!!!
[2:02:41] <+VektorTroika> BT = Bark Thing

[2:02:43] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Ok so Pat want the shortcut of defeating the boss to clear the entire area, fair enough
[2:02:44] <+IWantMyFamilyBack> bend him
[2:02:45] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Bola gun also works on BTs since it uses ropes with your blood on them
[2:02:46] <+BillyWimblett> anus face

[2:02:50] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> This music though
[2:02:51] <%marvel877> He takes more damage on his windups.
[2:02:53] <%ThatOneGameTester> were the poop grenades more or less effective?
[2:02:56] <WeebFever> Don't forget to pick up shinies and to carve after
[2:02:57] <+Fynale> RULES OF NATURE
[2:03:05] <%Meow0369> is pat now realising that he doesn't have enough grenades
[2:03:06] <Kejang> wow this boss sure is tough

[2:07:15] <+keyoray> @Deft_Thought probably mouse shakes
[2:07:16] <dukenux> i just realized the sensor thingy acts like the toy you hang over a baby crib
[2:07:17] <DocMadfox> @Deft_Thought Probably slowly move your mouse to shake the BB?
[2:07:29] <%marvel877> dont grab the blood bags out of spite.
[2:07:30] <Hydrapissed> ps pat paige cant play this game shes gana game over immediately
[2:07:33] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat You should probably reload since the BTs are still around to kill you again
[2:07:35] <%ShichiNoBushi> @Deft_Thought There's an option to instead of use motion controls to just press a button. R2/RT, I believe.
[2:07:38] <%LordlyBrush> LordlyBrush subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Last vid I watched was just delivery funtimes and now there are slime dogs. apatHoldon
[2:07:38] <GodlyLuigi> so what happens when you just go apeshit shaking the baby
[2:07:39] <beetbo2> @h4nfr3d hopefully Pat won't need to, or he'll be dunked on
[2:07:44] <+Darren716> Hey Pat did you see that the Shenmue 3 review embargo ends 2 days AFTER the game comes out? Holy shit its gonna be bad
[2:07:46] <agumon9000> ????
[2:07:50] <%Meow0369> The bt's will come back
[2:07:50] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The area is clear
[2:07:51] <%Meow0369> fairly soon
[2:07:51] <NotHereToStream> they will come back though, be quick
[2:07:54] <dukenux> dead fish
[2:07:55] <beetbo2> for now
[2:07:56] <+BillyWimblett> 200IQ strat
[2:07:57] <+OperatorPlease> @GodlyLuigi the baby gets pissed and dies
[2:07:59] <+MajorCrasher> they will come back soon
[2:08:00] <+MrFalco> they'll come back eventually, but hes safe for now
[2:08:02] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> They despawn when the beast comes out
[2:08:03] <%Meow0369> Like within the next 5 mins
[2:08:03] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Until those roads are built. You can never have enough chiral crystals.
[2:08:05] <%GarbageNirvana> They come back pretty quick
[2:08:07] <%Meow0369> At least that was my experience
[2:08:10] <beetbo2> RUN PAT RUN
[2:08:12] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> for only like 5mins of safety
[2:08:15] <Moonlight_Grimoire> loot fast
[2:08:16] <%marvel877> watch them comeback as soon as you turn a corner or something.
[2:08:17] <%TheMilhouseExperience> BTs are on cooldown tuner.
[2:08:17] <%Meow0369> it'll start sraining again really soon
[2:08:18] <Shwepie> Pat does not know that all Norman based grenades work?
[2:08:20] <+keyoray> @GodlyLuigi BB does not like it, and he explodes
[2:08:22] <Mendin> Yeah but 0 timefall is good for now
[2:08:22] <+griffball13> so 3 boxes of grenades from now on
[2:08:24] <h4nfr3d> @beetbo2 there'll be other cargo. if he decides to take the order. LUL
[2:08:26] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Timer*
[2:08:27] <%honeyman18> Is that faster than sneaking, speedrun strats?
[2:08:30] <Solidus_113> When you get into longer BT fights, it's best to just drop used/empty gear
[2:08:32] <wannabemoogle> Loot fast chew ass
[2:08:36] <%radda343> pat you can carry four blood bags in your utility pouch
[2:08:43] <lyzejag> Most bosses requires 3 box some of them 4
[2:08:49] <Zerud> I think it's like mule camps, if you clean the place it's free for the next hour or 2
[2:08:52] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Or just get farther in the story
[2:09:01] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Does 1 pack of grenade use exactly 1 bag of blood?
[2:09:03] <lyzejag> For 3 is enough for now i think
[2:09:07] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Your shoes were fine. That’s not min-maxing.
[2:09:11] <%ShichiNoBushi> Junk in that tru... case.
[2:09:15] <%This_is_Marco> PogChamp
[2:09:20] <+AndeOneNine> What Chapter is this?
[2:09:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> make sure to lvl up the weather station's shit off screen then
[2:09:23] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Smart pat
[2:09:23] <skeletonknifefight> get big reedus
[2:09:24] <%Meow0369> Shoes don't suffer any ill effects until it's like 10 percent left
[2:09:25] <%logoth_> grind the shitsz
[2:09:28] <Zerud> chapter 3 I think
[2:09:29] <Hellarussian> grind it super good
[2:09:30] <beetbo2> GRIND the shitz off
[2:09:33] <%This_is_Marco> 200iq stream strats
[2:09:34] <OmegaDeku> get the max amount of junk
[2:09:45] <lyzejag> Also when you ask for help there is limited items on the floor if you want blood grenades when there's only piss grenades just pick ALL things
[2:09:48] <h4nfr3d> nah, the first bosses only take seven to eight grenades. two boxes are enough there. the gun's better tho. elaSmile
[2:09:53] <+griffball13> yeyeye go for max junk
[2:09:54] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Are "Special Alloys" anything? I saw 60.0 kg of them back in the canyon when you fell running from the MULES. I saw some just now, too.
[2:09:56] <%ShichiNoBushi> Memory chip.
[2:09:58] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Next stream, Sam's ass is gonna take up half the screen, Pat's gonna be like "So I've grinding off screen..."
[2:10:06] <beetbo2> it got ghost-nuked
[2:10:06] <Hellarussian> its seen better days
[2:10:06] <Moonlight_Grimoire> go for max junk, you want to max junk guy fast
[2:10:08] <$HyperionXV> I think this is middle knot?
[2:10:11] <Mendin> Special Alloys are building resource #5 that unlocked recently
[2:10:14] <+MajorCrasher> gee maybe you should have brought a carrier pat
[2:10:15] <%This_is_Marco> @FirearmsInstructor they can be used to upgrade structures
[2:10:19] <jack_s1n> shoes are fine until they crumble
[2:10:19] <%ShichiNoBushi> Where is South Knot? Dallas? Houston?
[2:10:21] <SpaceGuntank> was this the city they dropped the nuke on?
[2:10:22] <lyzejag> Special alloys are used for some late game structures
[2:10:23] <+Javaa01> If you get the problem of a bloody boot, you can fix that by sitting down
[2:10:25] <Guardiansaiyan> @HyperionXV South Knot...said in debriefing
[2:10:30] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Special alloys is easy to get
[2:10:32] <tr00ly_> h
[2:10:33] <FirearmsInstructor> @This_is_Marco ahhhh thank you. I kept seeing them and was wondering.
[2:10:33] <Zerud> who needs carriers with legs like this!
[2:10:36] <mayorrev> lol
[2:10:36] <lyzejag> LOL
[2:10:36] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Special alloy=rusted flakes
[2:10:37] <h4nfr3d> LUL
[2:10:39] <+MrFalco> did he not get the carriers from the weather station?
[2:10:40] <Zerud> LUL
[2:10:41] <%LorcaNomad> LUL
[2:10:42] <+Reizie_Etherealm> There's a lot more ruins left over considering it's supposed to be disintigrated into dust?
[2:10:42] <%reddpop_> For all those complaining about not bringing a carrier, I beat the entire game and never used one
[2:10:46] <fettsvett201> Dropping in to see a little. Dont want to get spoiled too much. Game still worth playing I see.
[2:10:50] <FirearmsInstructor> @Mendin thanks :)
[2:11:02] <+griffball13> 10 more junk
[2:11:05] <ShinMaddrox> You ar emissing one
[2:11:07] <h4nfr3d> DuckerZ
[2:11:10] <$HyperionXV> @Guardiansaiyan Guess I'm getting my craters mixed up
[2:11:11] <cinless> always drink monster and piss on ghosts
[2:11:12] <agumon9000> Your missing one
[2:11:16] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> @MrFalco Yes he did
[2:11:20] <%This_is_Marco> @FirearmsInstructor theres probably more uses. Items you fabricate also take up different resources
[2:11:23] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Memory chip, straight ahead

[2:11:39] <%ShichiNoBushi> I think he has them all and one case is on his arm.
[2:11:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @reddpop_ I loved using them myself. So effective with the next skeleton you get.
[2:11:47] <dan_g_v> did pat suffer from bugged rank rewards? saw some peopke complaining about it
[2:11:47] <%Keyd00d> scan
[2:11:51] <%Meow0369> hey pat do you subscribe to the pizza friday philosophy?
[2:11:52] <agumon9000> Yeah you only have 100/110
[2:11:55] <DocMadfox> I don't know, I never played this game
[2:11:55] <cinless> the mission area is still there
[2:11:56] <ShinMaddrox> he has 100/110
[2:11:56] <Teyaric> Game displays potential pickup - you have 100 of 110
[2:11:57] <%ThatOneGameTester> says 10/11 pat
[2:12:09] <ShinMaddrox> It's on the for South west
[2:12:18] <%thenumber5point5> there is 110 kg of cargo

[2:12:23] <beetbo2> wow they're back fast
[2:12:24] <PinkSocks> pat please use a floating carrier
[2:12:25] <Mendin> Light rain is back, so ghosts soon
[2:12:31] <Isord> just scan everywhere
[2:12:35] <%xtremegamer80> Fast
[2:12:35] <Mendin> and by soon I mean right the fuck now apparently
[2:12:36] <cinless> god i hate this animation
[2:12:38] <Guardiansaiyan> times up
[2:12:40] <+AndeOneNine> CLIPPING
[2:12:42] <cinless> i mean i like it but i hate that it can't be skipped
[2:12:45] <Saunt> only needed 60kg of the total though
[2:12:50] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Man def should make use of that carrier
[2:12:51] <+D00msDayDan> it's bullshit that the BTs can repop while you're still in the area tbh
[2:12:56] <Isord> its not reallly
[2:12:58] <+griffball13> it really helps the junk guy
[2:12:58] <beetbo2> wasn't it at least 60?
[2:13:01] <%Tucker0603> no
[2:13:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> sucks when you're driving on the road and then that animation comes up
[2:13:03] <h4nfr3d> @cinless yeh, can't skip that one FeelsBadMan
[2:13:03] <%marvel877> You want big number go up, right?
[2:13:03] <Isord> THERE
[2:13:04] <rumuloh> S rank you coward
[2:13:06] <agumon9000> There!

[2:13:09] <+AndeOneNine> Left!
[2:13:09] <%WhereIsWill> good call to fight the boss and make this section easier. sucks they came back quickly
[2:13:13] <+Mr_Pylon> to the left
[2:13:13] <%TheMilhouseExperience> It’s not as bad in the truck but the arm animation is annoying.
[2:13:13] <+Reizie_Etherealm> So doest the BTs stay away for longer if you defeat the boss rather than letting it escape on its own?
[2:13:13] <+griffball13> left
[2:13:17] <+forlorncarton> Left!
[2:13:19] <Isord> it says 10/11 next to the item
[2:13:20] <+AndeOneNine> There straight ahead
[2:13:20] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat to your left it said "10.0 kg" for junk dealer

[2:13:43] <%dreamlandsfinest> Get the memory chip!
[2:13:45] <Isord> Grab the ebolas you have left

[2:14:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ooh
[2:14:34] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> @AngriestPat Carrier floats over water and crazy surfaces, makes it super useful
[2:14:38] <%This_is_Marco> you need a super soaker of blood
[2:14:41] <%cureneckbeard> How can they 3d print roads but not morphine

[2:14:44] <+Fynale> so did sams dooms level go up to see the BT's
[2:14:44] <%Meow0369> You get stronger grenades like
[2:14:45] <dukenux> monkaS
[2:14:46] <agumon9000> Normal Grenades already do that
[2:14:46] <Mendin> ...Yes ALL of th em eat your blood
[2:14:47] <%Meow0369> at the end of the game
[2:14:48] <zeroraider> they all do that
[2:14:48] <Jetsfantasy> Normal ones eat blood too
[2:14:48] <Calek> all blood grenades eat your blood
[2:14:49] <+timmc916> You look like you're compensating for something with all that
[2:14:49] <h4nfr3d> you get more if you do stuff for him
[2:14:50] <%honeyman18> Custom items are rares
[2:14:51] <wannabemoogle> vampire ghosts
[2:14:51] <Mendin> That's what the blood bags are for
[2:14:51] <+Javaa01> Hematic nades already do that
[2:14:52] <%ShichiNoBushi> He gives you more when you do a special delivery to him.
[2:14:52] <Valdorick> Throw your hemogoblins at 'em
[2:14:53] <Moonlight_Grimoire> normal grenades already do that
[2:14:55] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Don't try draw from blood bags first? (If you have them)
[2:14:56] <agumon9000> All blood grenades eat your blood
[2:14:57] <%Meow0369> Hemetic upgrades near the VERY end of the game
[2:14:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> THEY ALL EAT BLOOD
[2:14:58] <agumon9000> Yeah
[2:14:59] <%Tucker0603> all blood grenade eat blood
[2:15:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> !uptime
[2:15:01] <%DonatelloJose> What's that smell?
[2:15:01] <+MajorCrasher> equip a blood bag then
[2:15:02] <+Zeromaru2> yes
[2:15:02] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 15m.
[2:15:02] <Jetsfantasy> His eat MORE for BIG NUMBER
[2:15:03] <+griffball13> yeah bro
[2:15:03] <Saunt> Thats why you use a blood bag
[2:15:03] <+Link232> They're BLOOD grenades, what did you expect?
[2:15:03] <+AndeOneNine> @AngriestPat Use cum grenades
[2:15:03] <Shwepie> If only we had some kind of bag we could hold blood in.
[2:15:04] <h4nfr3d> the hematic ones, yeah
[2:15:04] <Mendin> WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU THINK THE BLOOD CAME FROM?!?!?!?!?!
[2:15:04] <%Strider222> yes
[2:15:05] <Demon_chann> yea
[2:15:05] <sirrice77> @AngriestPat Pat they all eat your blood, just they use blood packs first
[2:15:06] <%PinkSuprende> All blood items use your blood
[2:15:06] <agumon9000> THATS WHAT THE BLOOD PACK IS FOOR
[2:15:07] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Grenades take from you if you don't have blood bags.
[2:15:07] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> HAHAHA
[2:15:07] <%Tucker0603> YES
[2:15:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you can also use the carriers on an inclined ladder.
[2:15:09] <%Strider222> frist from your blood bag then yours
[2:15:09] <+Reizie_Etherealm> They do, but only if you don't have blood bags
[2:15:10] <%PinkSuprende> Thats why you equip blood bags
[2:15:10] <Mendin> PAAAAAAAAAT
[2:15:12] <Solidus_113> LUL
[2:15:12] <+Zeromaru2> That's what bloodbags are for
[2:15:12] <%honeyman18> Customs just use way more
[2:15:13] <tigerfang86> Can we get some blood 2.0
[2:15:13] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Holy shit Pat you didnt know?
[2:15:13] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Pat just realized this
[2:15:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> THAT'S WHAT BAGS ARE FOR!
[2:15:15] <%ShichiNoBushi> All blood weapons use Sam's blood. Blood packs offset this.
[2:15:16] <$HyperionXV> piss grenades don't use blood, but only work on the spooks not the fights
[2:15:16] <zeroraider> you need blood bags for them
[2:15:17] <%Tucker0603> BLOOD PACKS BOY
[2:15:18] <%Meow0369> They use YOUR blood
[2:15:20] <%Meow0369> test it
[2:15:21] <%Mekhet09> all of them do that.
[2:15:22] <+Kidkidd92> they do
[2:15:25] <+MajorCrasher> WHY DO YOU THINK YOU CARRY BLOOD BAGS?!
[2:15:26] <%PinkSuprende> They have been hurting you
[2:15:26] <Demon_chann> they dont use that much
[2:15:26] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Pat can be as dumb as Paige sometimes
[2:15:27] <%radda343> carry more blood packs you can hold four
[2:15:27] <wannabemoogle> yes they do
[2:15:28] <%honeyman18> Thus the BloodBags
[2:15:28] <%LorcaNomad> Blood grenades specifically @AngriestPat
[2:15:30] <Teyaric> All blood bags are YOURS
[2:15:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> THEY DO HURT YOU
[2:15:30] <$Arcaenum> You gotta equip the blood bags
[2:15:32] <+griffball13> they use your blood and a blood bag fulls you up
[2:15:33] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat Craftsman uses more blood but are stronger
[2:15:35] <%cureneckbeard> nyannHmm
[2:15:36] <DocMadfox> I don't understand what's going on, but I'm just glad Pat fucked up
[2:15:36] <Saunt> cause they've charged up through your blood already?
[2:15:36] <tigerfang86> YOU DORK
[2:15:37] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Oh Geez
[2:15:40] <Dakuu75> I think there's one that re-loads with your blood and one that's pre-made, right chat?
[2:15:40] <Skatedeandre> All the BLOOD weapons use your blood
[2:15:41] <+dante_must_die_exe> they big hurt you pat
[2:15:41] <Giothegame> @AngriestPat will you be watching Woolie get his ass blown out in front of Daisuke later tonight?
[2:15:43] <tigerfang86> YOU ABSOLUTE RUBE
[2:15:43] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> He played for this long and didnt know that...

[2:16:22] <Saunt> just chow down on time bugs to get blood back
[2:16:22] <beetbo2> take a long way
[2:16:23] <%deviljhojho_> dumb dumb
[2:16:32] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ohh item
[2:16:34] <Mendin> Drink some monster, eat some tardigrates, good as new
[2:16:35] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The fact that he knew this last stream but forgot about it is what bothers me
[2:16:35] <beetbo2> where is ghost?
[2:16:37] <tigerfang86> LMAO
[2:16:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> a carrier?
[2:16:49] <+Reizie_Etherealm> You mean beer?
[2:16:50] <DocMadfox> Why is the grenade blood? I haven't watched the VoDs of this and have no idea why it's blood
[2:16:50] <PinkSocks> a floating carrier
[2:16:53] <%applemon198> why doesnt he auto arrange his cargo!?
[2:16:53] <FalseEyeD> Unleash the beast!
[2:16:53] <Frozenflame01> this is the second time you forgot about the blood packs
[2:16:55] <h4nfr3d> yeah pat, seriously. everything in this game is totally self explanatory, right? LUL
[2:16:56] <%pilgrimsayswhat> That rusty ass Monster Can
[2:16:57] <+Buzzkill983> This crouching is hell on the knees, boss
[2:16:58] <beetbo2> Even BTs can't kill the Boomer juice
[2:17:03] <zeroraider> big boomer energy
[2:17:04] <+keyoray> you should say hello to the ghosts. they're lonely.
[2:17:04] <+MajorCrasher> MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT A CARRIER
[2:17:05] <%Keyd00d> lewd
[2:17:05] <agumon9000> @DocMadfox His Blood can kill BTs
[2:17:06] <CelioHogane> @DocMadfox repatriates blood kills BTs
[2:17:07] <NotHereToStream> wow im in a pickle with the bts, but thank god for monster energy drink tm for the pick me up
[2:17:07] <Demon_chann> ok
[2:17:15] <Mendin> @DocMadfox Since Sam has that weird undying thing, his bodily fluids mess with BTs
[2:17:16] <black_pariah> can you optimize this hurts to look at
[2:17:17] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Did you get that memory chip?
[2:17:18] <%honeyman18> Carriers are slow as shit, I only use them for long hauls over shitty ground
[2:17:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> They don't actually use THAT much material tho
[2:17:23] <$HyperionXV> @DocMadfox Sam's bodily fluids are like acid to the ghosts because he can come back from the dead. His blood is the best at it.
[2:17:24] <Mendin> He did FI
[2:17:24] <+griffball13> you will know if you try and see
[2:17:30] <dan_g_v> watef makes you old, so why not drink some red bull monster drink!
[2:17:32] <Dehlome> his blood kills BT because its just pure monster energy
[2:17:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> THEY SLOWLY EAT CRYSTALS. VERY SLOW
[2:17:39] <+Javaa01> The Floating Carriers are pretty cheap to run, they use like singular units of crystals
[2:17:39] <+D00msDayDan> carriers drain crystals VERY SLOWLY
[2:17:40] <Calek> carriers move just as fast as you do and they slowly eat crystals
[2:17:41] <seycheles> i was already avoiding monster energy drinks but now im going outta my way to avoid them
[2:17:42] <+MajorCrasher> It's a tiny amount of materials and you can store them when not in use
[2:17:45] <PinkSocks> They don't use barely anything@honeyman18 they keep up with your speed, they only disconnect if you go vertical for too long
[2:17:47] <+MrFalco> it's like 1 crystal a minute
[2:17:47] <%Keyd00d> but what if he needs those crystals
[2:17:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Like...I've been using them and notice VERY little drain on crystals, man. The drain is negligible.
[2:17:49] <%Keyd00d> later
[2:17:50] <+timmc916> Do they have Monster Zero Ultra for us 30yr old boomers?
[2:17:50] <Jetsfantasy> Carriers barely use much chiral shavings. But they carry a shit ton and you can RUN
[2:17:50] <%Taglog7> PartyPoro PartyPoro PartyPoro
[2:17:52] <%Tucker0603> @angriestpat the use of them is negligible
[2:17:53] <%Mekhet09> they don't do it fast ebough.
[2:17:55] <zeroraider> The BTs die from sugar overload
[2:17:55] <bloomingzonda> Pat you are doing fine and looking fine
[2:17:57] <beetbo2> blood granada?
[2:17:59] <%Meow0369> yes
[2:18:01] <beetbo2> BABY BT!
[2:18:01] <+Ceromidas> @AngriestPat i use two of those level 2 carriers almost all the time and i hardly notice a difference in my chiral crystal supply
[2:18:02] <DocMadfox> Thank you five people whose names I didn't catch

[2:18:35] <NotHereToStream> piss on them
[2:18:36] <%honeyman18> I never noticed any drain since I started using them. Basically free
[2:18:38] <FalseEyeD> Why do streamers always run?
[2:18:38] <DocMadfox> PISS ON THEM TO SHOW DOMINANCE!
[2:18:38] <lyzejag> PISS ON THEM

[2:18:51] <beetbo2> ey

[2:18:55] <FalseEyeD> Streamers never finish these stealth sections without running.
[2:18:56] <%cureneckbeard> Pat I saw the other sugar-free Monster energy drinks in the shop. Just thought you should know

[2:19:07] <Mendin> jesus christ
[2:19:08] <+AndeOneNine> Is there an animation where the scanner flips off the ghosts.
[2:19:10] <%AncelDeLambert> the scanner eye thing making hand signals is WEIRD
[2:19:10] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Oh no! Big difficulty. Barely escape from them.
[2:19:11] <OmegaDeku> quick tip pat: If you ever have a blood grenade, toss it at your feet when dealing with the BT pull down attack
[2:19:15] <DocMadfox> Piss on the ghosts to show your dominance Pat!
[2:19:17] <%Tallie> yes
[2:19:20] <tangoragahn> Those ghosts wanna grab your junk

[2:19:28] <ScreamLord> The robot arm/camera/sensor thing has more personality than Sam
[2:19:28] <h4nfr3d> at least it drives them away faster I think
[2:19:32] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Piss all over the ghosts
[2:19:33] <%Keyd00d> that works on humans too
[2:19:38] <%joylent_blue> DocMadfox it super works
[2:19:40] <%This_is_Marco> they dont die but they do back off
[2:19:40] <%TheMilhouseExperience> What?

[2:53:22] <%RupanSen> this is how I would get carried around if I was rich
[2:53:22] <awalr> it's because of nanomachines
[2:53:23] <%Shadowthedigger> Cause getting her to follow you probably broke fucking everything about how the game and AI work.
[2:53:24] <%Anime_Flux> oh no
[2:53:24] <Hellarussian> NO SHIT
[2:53:25] <+rareqq> Bikes in this game are almost as good as skyrim horses

[2:53:38] <Isord> @AngriestPat THE REAL IN-UNIVERSE EXPLANATION IS SHE DOESN'T WANT TO WALK
[2:53:38] <+studiocomfy> do you really want to do an escort mission that badly?
[2:53:39] <dukenux> It'd be creepier if she didn't

[3:17:48] <%Mekhet09> i don't think it's as offensive as people say it is because it's something that is said by someone in game.

[3:19:45] <%Keyd00d> Blown way out of proportion
[3:19:45] <+fromnibelheim> so people are just too stressed to fuck?
[3:19:46] <%Bt_Robot> LBGTQIA caused the BTs?
[3:19:46] <DocMadfox> I think people are taking this the wrong way and it can be summed up as "Everybody too worried about dying to worry about fucking"
[3:19:47] <+MrFalco> this is not as bad as advertised
[3:19:48] <dukenux> Counsel Man
[3:19:49] <trickquestionz> That wasn't even offensive, it doesn't make any fucking sense
[3:19:51] <%xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat This is a spin on Shinzo Abe
[3:19:53] <+LurkerGene> millennials not having as many kids?
[3:19:54] <LunarRemix> That's fucking bullshit. People would fuck like rabbits if the population was at risk
[3:19:54] <holydeviant1> There's nothing to be angry about
[3:19:54] <Nenatab> I fail to see an issue with this.
[3:19:54] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat osp had something to say about that
[3:19:56] <%RupanSen> I don't get the problem
[3:19:56] <TheSandmanIsHere> people stopped having sex because of Darling in the Franxx
[3:19:57] <Zombrocom> That was pretty tame. All it said is that people are not hooking up because of the apocalypse

[3:20:14] <skeletonknifefight> its not offensive its just stupid
[3:20:14] <%wydamn> "Why do the call you CounselorMan?" "Let me tell you about the history of about asexuality"
[3:20:14] <tiaramaki> Rape is based on sex tho... what?
[3:20:17] <PrimeNeverproc> its real tho ffs
[3:20:19] <Run44forrest> idk makes sense to me. why get close to someone if theres a high chance they will die

[3:20:20] <Hydrapissed> I mean maybe the death stranding makes people not horny lol
[3:20:20] <+keyoray> babies are expensive and we're poor.
[3:20:21] <%Fenrirlives> so it's nothing? This just seems like its part of the world building stuff
[3:20:21] <lemon_lore> everyone is poor with no time
[3:20:22] <ShinMaddrox> In short. The fear of death and Supernatural nukes makes people fearful of having relationships.
[3:20:23] <%joylent_blue> modern language that doesn't really apply at all to japan's issues
[3:20:23] <holydeviant1> It's not calling them a mental issue
[3:20:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> I guess people who want power just beat people up? and other chaste forms of violence?
[3:20:24] <+MurlinDurl> LUL
[3:20:25] <Junkles> the neet knows abou tthe societal sex problems
[3:20:27] <trickquestionz> Is this the only apocalypse where people AREN'T doing crazy sex crimes?
[3:20:28] <+calvinf10> And then also taking a potshot at gay people
[3:20:28] <%Explodincatz> his movies are gunna be GREAT
[3:20:29] <%Typhaeon> I don't think it's what Kojima believes just because a character he wrote said it
[3:20:30] <holydeviant1> Nowhere does it even hint that
[3:20:31] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[3:20:31] <Teyaric> You do get Death Stranding is all just a giant Anti-Abortion metaphor, yeah?
[3:20:34] <+hkey_local_machine> yes, rest in private room
[3:20:34] <%deviljhojho_> just like my da's opinions
[3:20:35] <That_Dogg> Rape is not necessarily exclusively about power.
[3:20:35] <+Double_Tap_That> David Cage-ima
[3:20:35] <+D00msDayDan> part of it is real biology though, animals too busy trying to survive got no time to fuck
[3:20:35] <$HeroToxiko> it ties a lot of crazy shit to asexuality that has nothing to do with asexuality
[3:20:35] <%PinkSuprende> Yes, when you rest
[3:20:36] <%Keyd00d> yeah sex isn't involved with rape at all
[3:20:36] <Moonlight_Grimoire> you reload when you rest
[3:20:37] <$HyperionXV> The guns reload when you go in a room
[3:20:37] <%radda343> rest in room
[3:20:38] <Isord> yes in the private room
[3:20:38] <%Maids4lyfe> you have to rest in a private room
[3:20:38] <NotHereToStream> i don;t know pat, do you want to bring babies into this shitty world
[3:20:39] <%shootbang_exe> ammo refills after resting
[3:20:39] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Flavor text for nobody
[3:20:41] <chaospudding> the guns get reloaded when you rest in a room
[3:20:42] <%Keyd00d> but anyway
[3:20:42] <itesket> piss in themn
[3:20:42] <FrankysDream> rest in shelter
[3:20:43] <+MajorCrasher> they reload when you rest
[3:20:44] <mayorrev> there ya go
[3:20:44] <Storm_Samurai> If stupid was offensive no one would watch this channel LUL
[3:20:45] <%deviljhojho_> wh
[3:20:46] <%wydamn> GUN UNLOCKED
[3:20:47] <NeroInfinite> Yeah that was most people's take on that, it was like "Yeah this is dumb man".
[3:20:49] <%supersugoisenpai1> It's a japanese man writing about people not having babies
[3:20:49] <+Kriptin> "Damn that nut was so good it'll kill me" -causes a nuclear blast
[3:20:51] <gitskreig> now, if he'd said "man, because we can just chiral print everything and never leave our rooms, nobody is hooking up" then it would make sense
[3:20:51] <TheSandmanIsHere> that mail was pretty franxxed up
[3:20:51] <$HeroToxiko> MORE GUN
[3:20:53] <mayorrev> awwww
[3:20:53] <Cymen90> S E X
[3:20:54] <+Javaa01> You had ammo in reserve
[3:20:54] <%deviljhojho_> THEY LOVE IT
[3:20:54] <%Tucker0603> it's just fucking dumb shit that makes no sense
[3:20:55] <%floralkami> wait, what's the offensiveness?
[3:20:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> damn them
[3:20:56] <jack_s1n> only in private rooms
[3:20:57] <kvassimoto> ID tagged guns monkaS
[3:20:58] <%marvel877> UH
[3:20:58] <cheesedburgers> Doesn’t seem offensive just very not informed like he heard the terms mentioned once on TV
[3:20:59] <+VektorTroika> Yeah, you reload your blood gun by pumping it fulla BLOOD
[3:20:59] <%valriot> @angriestpat I mean it makes some sense when the world is AS FUCKED as it is, and miscarriages = BTs
[3:21:05] <transporterthesequel> Rest in their FUCK BED
[3:21:06] <Moonlight_Grimoire> need 5 stars at shelters to rest in them.
[3:21:08] <Shwepie> Either nap or fabricate a new gun.
[3:21:10] <%Typhaeon> Can't really say much about generational poverty, the isolation of the Internet, etc. when you have to hew to the setting of a post-apocalyptic world
[3:21:11] <mayorrev> FLASHBANG THROUGH THE DOOR
[3:21:12] <%wydamn> That gun will never leave his hands now. Like that one Outer Limits episode.
[3:21:14] <%arsonistdaria> It's offensive because it's asinine to a degree that trivializes people but it's definitely more stupid than shitty
[3:21:15] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Like at the current year it makes sense. Since who the fuck would want to have a child in a world where fucking ghosts are real and rain super ages you and death turns your corpse into a nuke
[3:21:16] <%marvel877> Go to sleep, Sam.
[3:21:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> damn normies
[3:21:22] <wannabemoogle> @valriot Shit that be bad
[3:21:22] <SpaceGuntank> pat you dummy there is a literal shelter down the path, you rested at it last time.
[3:21:23] <NeroInfinite> So it'll work you too.
[3:21:24] <%C0baltCrusade> !uptime
[3:21:24] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 21m.
[3:21:26] <%Keyd00d> It's REALLY powerful. Especially agianst living things
[3:21:30] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @gitskreig that exact sentiment is said earlier in the game
[3:21:34] <Run44forrest> oh fuck miscarriages are BTs huh monkaS
[3:21:47] <StephaniexMeow> death via childbirth is probably likely too
[3:21:48] <gitskreig> So, if dead people explode, would an abortion be a Baby Boomer?
[3:21:50] <%xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat Didn't you dump a bunch of stuff into your locker?
[3:21:50] <%ShichiNoBushi> Left Speed Skeleton at the Studio.
[3:21:53] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat is Mama
[3:21:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> whats a speed skeleton?
[3:21:53] <CelioHogane> Get the speed ones!
[3:21:54] <$HeroToxiko> The offensive part is, there are people dumb enough to believe it and this is the first time they'll get this info @cheesedburgers
[3:21:55] <%arancet> @AngriestPat i can see kojima leering at schoolkids from an alley yelling "WHY WONT YOU KIDS FUUUUCK?"
[3:21:56] <waifoong98> try speed skeleton Pat
[3:21:58] <%wydamn> I mean, Bridge babies technically are never born, they're fetuses forever.
[3:22:01] <Hydrapissed> @gitskreig lol
[3:22:04] <NeroInfinite> BB's are still births
[3:22:04] <TheSandmanIsHere> @run44forrest stillbirths should be, but if miscarriages were then there'd be even more explosions
[3:22:06] <$HeroToxiko> also GUN TIME YEAAAAH
[3:22:06] <%Maids4lyfe> So the Sam Order
[3:22:06] <%deviljhojho_> good ol kilos
[3:22:08] <Teyaric> Dude, there is a GHOST STORM going on! Aim towards the plot!
[3:22:09] <%deviljhojho_> the superior metric
[3:22:09] <+Reizie_Etherealm> If sex = BT then that's understandable tbh
[3:22:09] <%Maids4lyfe> it's good
[3:22:11] <%Fenrirlives> Is Mama's ringtone just Rockaby Baby?
[3:22:13] <lyzejag> @HeroToxiko Yeah thank you for saying this
[3:22:15] <Rotabrutsama> kojima is best friends with abe i see
[3:22:21] <+paladinstarbuster> this thing that hasn't been studied well scientificly is dumb because we don't understand it
[3:22:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you can just go around really
[3:22:26] <Azaziz> 1
[3:22:27] <MicrotonalMatt> The BTs are all the unfertalized eggs from the not sex
[3:22:28] <$antibonehurtingjuice> fuck that place super hard
[3:22:32] <TheSandmanIsHere> because a lot of times miscarriages happen so earlier the mother might never even know she was pregnant
[3:22:40] <katocrimson> bola gun the mules
[3:22:49] <%wydamn> The BTs are all the loads you blew into a kleenex.
[3:22:49] <mayorrev> I think that's the general codec ringtone?
[3:22:51] <CelioHogane> Use the speed squeleton!
[3:22:53] <MicrotonalMatt> That's why you deliver cum
[3:22:54] <mayorrev> Mixtape!
[3:22:54] <waifoong98> just outrun them heh
[3:22:56] <ScatterCatt> I'm just cranking out standard orders in the first part of the game.....do standard orders ever stop? Or does the game just keep generating new standard orders so you never run out?
[3:22:59] <+Kriptin> Birth control, the manual nuke detonator
[3:22:59] <%ShichiNoBushi> Going north around will get you around the MULEs and the ravines.
[3:22:59] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Jack all their shot and use it to build highways.
[3:23:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this mission's rewards are so good
[3:23:08] <+griffball13> yes more more
[3:23:11] <gitskreig> Yeesh, so a spontanious miscarriage and some woman just randomly goes ghost nuclear?
[3:23:14] <lyzejag> @mayorrev Every character has their own ringtone
[3:23:19] <sirrice77> @ScatterCatt they do not run out, they just repeat forever
[3:23:24] <TheSandmanIsHere> bola gun the mules then drop them in the incinerator
[3:23:26] <%xtremegamer80> Honestly, if you take it from the standpoint that the interview is taken by the Prime Minister of Japan's thing and Japan is having a birth decline crisis, you can see why he would say something like that.
[3:23:27] <mayorrev> ooooh
[3:23:29] <wannabemoogle> Still cracks me up at the joke about Darling in Franx is Abe propaganda to get the Weebs to have kids
[3:23:30] <+Dumb_Parrot> People can't discuss anything anymore without being offended. Saying aversion to human contact = homosexuality etc is not accurate either.
[3:23:32] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat i think there is another order going to the same place
[3:23:34] <NeroInfinite> recycle that empty shit
[3:23:34] <+dante_must_die_exe> Shoes huge fucked
[3:23:37] <%ShichiNoBushi> Recycle some of those.
[3:23:39] <+keyoray> Nah, I think BT's are only made form fully formed humans dying.
[3:23:45] <Run44forrest> its just humans that make BTs though its not like an animal dying would cause a voidout right
[3:23:46] <+MrFalco> @gitskreig not quite, a dead baby = a BT after a day or two
[3:23:46] <%valriot> Even if the baby is born, that's still a child for the duration of 15 years, and that's FUCKED UP to deal with in this world
[3:23:48] <ScatterCatt> @sirrice77 So basically you should do standard orders to help get every place to 5 stars then stop doing them.
[3:23:50] <CelioHogane> Unborn babies don't have souls!
[3:23:52] <+MrFalco> then the BT causes the boom
[3:23:57] <+MajorCrasher> CARRIER
[3:24:00] <MicrotonalMatt> Is Norman actually Amazon Stork? Coming straight to your genitals to deliver your packa-I mean children.
[3:24:00] <StephaniexMeow> DON'T ASK QUESTIONS
[3:24:01] <%TheMilhouseExperience> We told you to stow your shit.
[3:24:02] <+keyoray> It has to do with the soul/ka
[3:24:05] <lyzejag> @ScatterCatt The orders will avaiable again after some time and it's infiinite even if you are max rank with that person
[3:24:07] <%MisterVantes> Did pat replace his fucked up boots?
[3:24:07] <%wydamn> @MrFalco and the the Boomers come
[3:24:14] <Graknaz> No dude just press R1
[3:24:14] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Those babies aren't baptised, they don't count towards becoming BTs lol
[3:24:16] <Graknaz> when on storage
[3:24:19] <+D00msDayDan> you can recycle from the locker if you hit R1
[3:24:20] <sirrice77> @ScatterCatt yes, unless you find one you havent done and want to S rank it or it unlocks something for you
[3:24:21] <%HunguyTV> It doesnt
[3:24:21] <+subdude_> You should be able to recycle from the locker
[3:24:23] <+BloodyBurney> no, you can open personal locker from the recycle menu
[3:24:24] <gitskreig> Right, so if we killed Pat, he wouldn't make a BT because he's a filthy ginner
[3:24:39] <Djinnazz> It just needs to be near you
[3:24:46] <%xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat Do the delivery bots help with the star stuff?
[3:24:51] <StromkoPenguin> It didn't just say people weren't having kids, it said people were giving up on sex entirely. That's why it's stupid. A hard life doesn't make your libido disappear.
[3:24:53] <+paladinstarbuster> LUL gunner
[3:24:56] <+MajorCrasher> GET A CARRIER
[3:24:57] <Run44forrest> what if instead of incinerating bodies we just ate them?
[3:24:59] <wannabemoogle> Begs the question does the Beach each person have develop when they get older or is it there at any form of birth?

[3:32:34] <+Kriptin> You can't ride a bike and have a carrier can you?
[3:32:36] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat you can put it on the cart just pick it up with your hand first
[3:32:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @chaospudding same.
[3:32:44] <CelioHogane> Pretty sure it's 3.
[3:32:46] <%Rlexp> you can also link 3 carriers together

[3:32:53] <%joylent_blue> chaospudding thats a hilarious problem to have

[3:33:04] <lyzejag> Same
[3:33:10] <Shwepie> Pat just littering everywhere....
[3:33:15] <%Rlexp> I thought it was 3, maybe im just big wrong
[3:33:18] <CelioHogane> can you skate one while using the others for carry?
[3:33:27] <+tragicharmony46> so what would you want from ff16 what i want is a classic game with a returning job system
[3:33:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah and the drain is negligible.
[3:33:38] <%Rlexp> doesn't work with ropes either
[3:33:40] <%cureneckbeard> what about bike though
[3:33:40] <Dr_Mooose> "I don't need this right now" - Pat
[3:33:41] <%honeyman18> You can use 2 at once
[3:33:41] <beetbo2> Carrier kun go CLUNK
[3:33:43] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat i think you can even have muiltipul connected to eachother like a chain
[3:33:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeyeye
[3:33:47] <%radda343> you can chain two of them too
[3:33:48] <+MajorCrasher> You can have two, that's 600kg @angriestpat
[3:33:50] <waifoong98> time for big greed
[3:33:55] <Djinnazz> The lvl2 ones can hold 8 canisters

[3:33:58] <lyzejag> You take it everywhere
[3:34:00] <mayorrev> Can the cable break? monkaS
[3:34:00] <+MrFalco> use two at a time for maximum load
[3:34:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> barely even noticeable. Tho you'll need a ladder with a good inclining angle
[3:34:02] <ScreamLord> "But it uses resources!" BabyRage
[3:34:02] <sasparillatango> how does it do on ladders?
[3:34:03] <Graknaz> What happens if you try climbing using rope?
[3:34:04] <aeonicvector> just not SUPER Vertical terrain
[3:34:05] <%Keyd00d> the line can snap
[3:34:06] <+ArmoredTeeth> You can't climb ladders with it either, I think
[3:34:07] <Mendin> Pat have you pissed recently? You've got to be full to popping
[3:34:12] <mayorrev> oh dear
[3:34:13] <PinkSocks> it only detaches if you go very vertical
[3:34:13] <$HyperionXV> it doesn't handle crevaces well either
[3:34:13] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> It can climb hills
[3:34:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> if the ladder is too steep, doesn't work
[3:34:16] <+Javaa01> It'll deal with anything except for sheer cliffs, basically
[3:34:20] <+Simketh> What chapter is Pat on?
[3:34:25] <Isord> 3
[3:34:25] <%Tucker0603> 3
[3:34:26] <+MajorCrasher> you just can't climb ropes and ladders, everything else is fine

[3:34:26] <Mendin> late chapter 3
[3:34:26] <CelioHogane> 3

[3:34:38] <Isord> he could go to 4 soonish
[3:34:42] <+Simketh> cool, wanna avoid spoilers for where Im at :D
[3:34:45] <Demon_chann> HOLY SHIT
[3:34:46] <cherrycottontail> After 3 ends i bet it's like 10 minute per chapter

[3:38:57] <gitskreig> Bang bang, make my bladder bigger

[3:39:03] <h4nfr3d> oh but there are trucks. and you saw them already.
[3:39:04] <Moonlight_Grimoire> remember, you can have two of them linked to you, so you can have maximum bullshit
[3:39:08] <Picosunloaded> you can use 2 at a time
[3:39:10] <%Animorphimagi> Just drive
[3:39:12] <%wydamn> Fun fact: The average male bladder can hold as much as 560 ml of piss. Meaning Sam has almost double the bladder capacity of a normal man.
[3:39:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah but it sucks when u have to outrun Mules @AngriestPat
[3:39:17] <h4nfr3d> ok, trucks won't go everywhere

[3:44:38] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Paige is using tank controls LUL

[3:45:04] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Play some Baba without Pat to help

[3:45:07] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Give us stumbo
[3:45:10] <%skizzuto> God if Paige saw some of the shit baba pulls later in the game her brain would literally melt out of her ears

[3:56:48] <Run44forrest> mads :(
[3:56:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> could these actually be SAM's memories?
[3:57:00] <morningmoondude> CHUG THE BABY JUICE
[3:57:01] <%oktavia_von> I see we're at the dating sim part of the game

[3:57:17] <lyzejag> It's random
[3:57:18] <Run44forrest> its random
[3:57:19] <wannabemoogle> oh he got beat up real good
[3:57:23] <Shwepie> @DesuDesuDokiDoki No, they're obviously BB's memories.
[3:57:23] <%wydamn> @ManjiKarp it depends on how often you rest
[3:57:30] <%Arazien> Arazien subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! One more for a gross new eyeball
[3:57:32] <+Reizie_Etherealm> BibleThump
[3:57:35] <ManjiKarp> Ahhhh okay, makes sense
[3:57:38] <Run44forrest> :(
[3:57:39] <%MelBrooksKA> Thanks drunk dad
[3:57:39] <gitskreig> maybe the reason nobody has kids is because they now people will try to put the mom in a coma and turn the kid into a BB
[3:57:41] <morningmoondude> yeah, but Reedus is BB, obviously
[3:57:42] <mayorrev> are these told in order or are they random?
[3:57:42] <+ArmoredTeeth> Truck time
[3:57:44] <sasparillatango> do we know why mikkelson is so mads?
[3:57:46] <%Maids4lyfe> I wish Mads was my Dad
[3:57:50] <+MurlinDurl> wonder who gave him that shiner
[3:57:51] <gitskreig> seing as they last like a year and every porter needs one
[3:58:01] <lyzejag> I wish Mads was my daddy
[3:58:25] <StephaniexMeow> oh geez, so he'd be carrying his baby self around, and if it died, he would die?
[3:58:26] <%ArcanumMBD> you need grenades
[3:58:27] <+griffball13> get some grenades
[3:58:27] <devanmuse> has Mads made any appearance outside of those cutscenes yet?
[3:58:27] <%HunguyTV> Make the grenade first
[3:58:28] <%Meow0369> Auto just click auto
[3:58:32] <+D00msDayDan> it's like utility pouch for grenades
[3:58:32] <Djinnazz> in the grende pouch
[3:58:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it goes in Grenade Pouch option
[3:58:34] <Kongro_> oh my god
[3:58:37] <%Meow0369> You need the grenades first and you can select pouch
[3:58:39] <ThDark> Equip a grenade, auto-equip
[3:58:45] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Used?
[3:58:46] <+netrac> what is mads?
[3:58:50] <%TheMilhouseExperience> In the pouch.
[3:58:51] <%Meow0369> Just get like 6 hemet grenades
[3:58:53] <+ArmoredTeeth> Bathwater grenades
[3:58:53] <%Maids4lyfe> it just goes in the pouch
[3:58:54] <agumon9000> You can take the road all the way back to the big base
[3:58:55] <katocrimson> pee poo grenades
[3:58:55] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat No hemo grenades are blood. Number 2 grenades are shit.
[3:58:57] <+MrFalco> when you pick the grenade in your cargo menu, an option for grenade pouch will appear
[3:59:01] <tigerfang86> TRICKED
[3:59:03] <+ClaudeMcGarren> thats piss poo not blood
[3:59:04] <tigerfang86> JAPED
[3:59:10] <$antibonehurtingjuice> smdh
[3:59:13] <%Meow0369> You'll need em for 'higgs'
[3:59:15] <%Meow0369> ey
[3:59:18] <Djinnazz> The craftman should have some in storage
[3:59:20] <lyzejag> It cost nothing
[3:59:24] <+MajorCrasher> get stun bomb
[3:59:26] <%HunguyTV> One or two stun grenades can knock out an entire mule truck
[3:59:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> 30 grenades on ya
[3:59:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> no damage to em
[3:59:44] <+Kriptin> TROOK
[3:59:46] <metalwater8> What chapter is pat on now?
[3:59:52] <%Maids4lyfe> 3 still
[3:59:53] <+Kriptin> 3
[3:59:53] <+Reizie_Etherealm> So the weight will be added after you fill the pouches I see
[3:59:58] <+griffball13> you had one left
[4:00:01] <%Meow0369> Weight will never matter again with power skele 3
[4:00:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> only have 7
[4:00:05] <%honeyman18> So basically it unlocks having everything all the time?
[4:00:06] <%Meow0369> only the actual height limit
[4:00:08] <waifoong98> well it matters a bit if u use speed legs
[4:00:19] <GodlyLuigi> grenades are nothing in weight compared to the weight of AMERICA on your shoulders
[4:00:23] <h4nfr3d> I'm also still on 3, highway almost built FeelsGoodMan
[4:00:32] <+ArmoredTeeth> There's friendly fire on stun grenades so be careful
[4:00:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> truck
[4:00:33] <Shwepie> Weight still matters, you just have a lot of tools to deal with it now.
[4:00:34] <StephaniexMeow> @AngriestPat Have you watched the movie called Predestination? Cuz oh damn
[4:00:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> truuuuuuck
[4:00:41] <+MurlinDurl> speed legs are the shit
[4:00:44] <+MajorCrasher> TRUCK

[4:00:54] <wannabemoogle> Truck-kun
[4:00:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> TRUCK-KUN

[4:02:25] <wannabemoogle> Omg
[4:02:32] <StephaniexMeow> secret dog ending
[4:02:36] <+MajorCrasher> to carry the materials
[4:02:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> truck can carry SO much more than that MULE thing you took
[4:02:37] <h4nfr3d> it's a bit better than the other one
[4:02:37] <%HunguyTV> It protects cargo from timefall since its roofed
[4:02:39] <%honeyman18> I see nvmd
[4:02:42] <%ShaneWhite> What’s up @AngriestPat
[4:02:43] <LunarRemix> But trucks are cool though
[4:02:54] <+Kriptin> "Make me a road Ball"
[4:02:55] <Spectatorlo_ol> We need roads
[4:03:00] <Shwepie> How the hell did someone put 7 metal into it?
[4:03:14] <%Explodincatz> America loves it
[4:03:16] <Spectatorlo_ol> Murica
[4:03:16] <Djinnazz> this ws the FIRTS thing I did
[4:03:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that is a very good question @Shwepie
[4:03:21] <aeonicvector> @Shwepie they didnt, it decayed
[4:03:23] <%Meow0369> That's actually amazing
[4:03:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> every bit gets likes
[4:03:31] <$antibonehurtingjuice> now do that 30 more times
[4:03:35] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Still not connected north
[4:03:36] <%honeyman18> over that shit, it's kind of worth it
[4:03:37] <pillowwasp> Build bridges
[4:03:40] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[4:03:42] <+griffball13> its not connected
[4:03:44] <Zaphire_Saucypants> not connect
[4:03:45] <ianabstract> Is that one in networ
[4:03:47] <%ArcanumMBD> That one isn't in a connected zone
[4:03:47] <%reddpop_> Thats not on the chiral network
[4:03:48] <NotHereToStream> if you connect to the chiral network
[4:03:48] <Ted_the_red> it's not connected to the network
[4:03:50] <ianabstract> network
[4:03:50] <+MajorCrasher> materials are heavy, truck help
[4:03:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you'll need to go to the Collector nearby
[4:03:51] <+MrFalco> check your zone map
[4:03:51] <+Loyks> NOT ON THE NETWORK
[4:03:52] <Mendin> The river-bridging part of the road is gonna be garbo
[4:03:53] <Moonlight_Grimoire> check it's network
[4:03:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> he's in MULE territory
[4:03:55] <NeroInfinite> That one isn't in thenetwork
[4:03:59] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> NETWORK
[4:04:01] <wannabemoogle> You cannot control the hivemind
[4:04:01] <%velemi> network pat
[4:04:05] <Djinnazz> it doesn matter
[4:04:05] <%Meow0369> Roads aren't directly multiplayer either, they only get SOME resources from multiplayer
[4:04:08] <%cureneckbeard> patworl
[4:04:10] <pillowwasp> GET AHEAD OF THEM
[4:04:11] <%juxtest> The Department of Transportation is still the same even in the apocalypse
[4:04:16] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat You have to connect whoever lives there in the chiral network LUL
[4:04:18] <%honeyman18> don't the safehouse add network space?
[4:04:19] <%Meow0369> You can't have a full highway without contributing yourself
[4:04:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and You'll have to go to them yourself, cuz the Main quest doesn't ask you to
[4:04:28] <+MurlinDurl> are the highway buildspots dev placed?
[4:04:32] <%pilgrimsayswhat> SPEEEEEEEEEEEEED
[4:04:34] <Djinnazz> @AngriestPat Roads aren't apart of the chiral network thing.
[4:04:34] <pi_in_the_sci> there's another road that splits off near the Craftsman
[4:04:36] <superd4v3> @MurlinDurl Yes
[4:04:41] <ThDark> @Meow0369 I've had multiple segments of roads built purely by other players, that I never contributed materials to
[4:04:41] <GoYaK> !uptime

[4:07:26] <devanmuse> "Cosplayer" of all the hobbies that would survive the death stranding...
[4:07:29] <+NitronStreams> i just said cosplayer cuz i cant believe they put cosplay in this game
[4:07:30] <Kisiel250> take some rope with you
[4:07:35] <FalseEyeD> @Shwepie KonCha
[4:07:40] <ThDark> Yes, it really is
[4:07:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, this area sucks without roads.
[4:07:43] <Moonlight_Grimoire> take some rope
[4:07:57] <lyzejag> Always take 2 ropes and ladders
[4:08:00] <%Bt_Robot> Who could it be?
[4:08:04] <Djinnazz> L3
[4:08:04] <Spectatorlo_ol> Bikes are butter than trucks
[4:08:10] <ThDark> If you took a truck there you would have hated life
[4:08:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Yeah...you'll have to go to him yourself to start on that.
[4:08:33] <%GarbageNirvana> It's weird how situational trucks are
[4:08:39] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Pat hit L3.
[4:08:46] <ThDark> Why does my bike have such a slower default speed than yours? Mine barely moves at all unless boosted
[4:08:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> At least...I didn't find a job telling me to go to him...had to find him myself to unlock.
[4:08:48] <h4nfr3d> @ThDark it's ok if you know the paths but a bitch to find them first.
[4:08:49] <%honeyman18> The secret dude links that one
[4:08:51] <KilljoyHexx> The bikes in this are so cool
[4:09:04] <wannabemoogle> Is it Mr. Haytor?
[4:09:08] <+MajorCrasher> trucks are not at all situational for me because I finished the roads
[4:09:09] <jack_s1n> why are you going slow?
[4:09:17] <+Plasmasnake3> that road is super useful
[4:09:21] <lyzejag> HE's gonna crash if he go fast
[4:09:24] <sovayell> @ThDark your cargo weight matters a lot with bikes
[4:09:27] <yuribo26> Bumpy road
[4:09:29] <jacknerik> Did yoji shinkawa do the designs for all the suits and vehicles and stuff?
[4:09:33] <FalseEyeD> Bampin'
[4:09:33] <$Yakobro> YEAH
[4:09:39] <jack_s1n> just drive better
[4:09:42] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat It's almost like you don't learn from your mistakes *thinking emoji*
[4:09:43] <NeroInfinite> RIP balls
[4:09:45] <%GarbageNirvana> @jacknerik He was the art director, yeah
[4:09:46] <h4nfr3d> @MajorCrasher just missing two or three small parts. :)
[4:09:47] <ThDark> @jacknerik He was the lead character/mechanical designer, yes
[4:09:50] <Overloard> since when did america turn into scotland
[4:09:53] <+MurlinDurl> ridah! JUMP! ridahhh! KICK!
[4:09:54] <%TheMilhouseExperience> All right since nobody gets it. L3 activates turbo. You go fast, hard but it drains battery.
[4:09:54] <+griffball13> can you use a transporter while riding a bike @AngriestPat
[4:09:55] <lyzejag> Go left
[4:09:56] <+JacktheMan18> This driving is amazing

[4:10:08] <Kisiel250> 10$ he will fall down there
[4:10:14] <jacknerik> Honestly Yoji is the person that makes Kojima games worth playing
[4:10:15] <%GarbageNirvana> It's in a weird spot

[4:18:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I did NOT get a quest
[4:18:59] <%honeyman18> Find him and lost luggage for him
[4:19:02] <lyzejag> YOu can do both
[4:19:02] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Yes
[4:19:02] <+Fonzies_Jacket> you need a rope or a ladder to reach him
[4:19:02] <%ShichiNoBushi> You find him and get a quest from him.
[4:19:02] <$OranHexthief> lost cargo in the area will let you deliver @AngriestPat
[4:19:04] <%cureneckbeard> You have to find the quest

[4:19:15] <wannabemoogle> Otters hold each other hands when they sleep so they don't drift away
[4:19:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> huh...I guess it's a matter of being patient enough for it then. I just went out to him.
[4:19:32] <wannabemoogle> I don't know why I remember that
[4:19:37] <%ShichiNoBushi> Did you get the Pizza guy? How do you get him?
[4:19:37] <lyzejag> That's cute
[4:19:39] <%honeyman18> for The collector
[4:19:43] <Railgun5> He has a quest you can start from his base
[4:19:50] <Railgun5> If you can't find any lost cargo
[4:19:56] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @wannabemoogle I knew that but gosh is it cute as hell to be reminded
[4:19:57] <beetbo2> otters would survive the death stranding out of sheer cuteness
[4:19:59] <ThDark> I don't think the Collector is a story required base, so you can totally miss him
[4:20:01] <lyzejag> Yeah i just forgot this area existed and jus took quest for the collector

[4:21:12] <%InnocentAce> He boosted right into a rock
[4:21:13] <%bevyrage> @AngriestPat you needed to boost once you were on the ramp. earlier makes you catch air prior to the slate
[4:21:14] <Mendin> Time to swap to the speed legs?

[4:31:14] <+Fonzies_Jacket> Famitsu is trash
[4:31:14] <%GarbageNirvana> This is why you don't read Famitsu reviews
[4:31:18] <gitskreig> Is that why you aren't going? Because no state-funded healthcare?
[4:31:18] <Kongro_> He didn't review it
[4:31:19] <%radda343> pat that's not who is in the cave
[4:31:19] <%PinkSuprende> That's not a reviewer, that's the president of famitsu

[4:31:44] <%valriot> @angriestpat He didn't review it, he's the guy who owns it. also tons of places gave near perfect scores
[4:31:44] <Mendin> Wait Paige I thought you scheduled an eye doctor appointment TWO MONTHS AGO
[4:31:45] <Ion_Laser> If he didn't give a full disclosure about being in the game. Then it's unethical
[4:31:48] <Vlesh> Had a similar discussion with Matt actually about that game he is a part of that he reviewed. He said he did it before being a part of it, but still.
[4:31:48] <+MajorCrasher> He didn't review it personally and they almost always give Kojima perfect scores anyway @angriestpat
[4:31:50] <Mendin> What the HECK
[4:31:51] <+traytr> it's like IGN giving Sw/Sh a good review because they make money off of sales that are through their link
