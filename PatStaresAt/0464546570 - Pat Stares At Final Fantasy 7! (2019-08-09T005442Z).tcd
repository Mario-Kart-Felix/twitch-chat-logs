[0:08:33] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat I left when the chat went emote only, I assumed you were about to beat it. Did you?

[0:08:40] <Rexwarrior1> that's cool Pat, glad to hear it

[0:08:54] <+Grayhammatter> paige's brain would just zurt out
[0:08:55] <hntronium> does she hate it because of the night time
[0:08:59] <%Mr_Pylon> Outer Wilds is the best at making you ask 'what the fuck is that?' and then giving you a great answer
[0:09:01] <%starotter70> Quantum Mechanics hurt the gears
[0:09:01] <%RubberFistFight> Paige shit herself hard when the Anglerfish showed up. That was great.
[0:09:01] <+linSP> i like how pat accidentally stumbled into the city's secret exit instead of doing it the normal way
[0:09:02] <%ElenaManetta> He has one last big secret to uncover

[0:09:23] <hntronium> I'm hungry too
[0:09:24] <%starotter70> Pat needs his McDonalds that he loves so much
[0:09:26] <majindusto> Pat, I just listened to the Yakuza podcast you were on...You keep saying there are THREE Black Panther games...There are only TWO!!!

[0:11:35] <%Ranting_Raven> I just spent 3 hours putting together for my fiance. I would love a nap lol

[0:18:50] <%supersugoisenpai1> Matra magic is an awesome early spell
[0:18:51] <%AncelDeLambert> Enemy Skill is super fucking broken and makes all other materia obsolete

[0:19:11] <misterspotswood> tifa was my first waifu when i was like 6 and im super happy to get her in this new HD goodness
[0:19:15] <%dheng1> It gets easier once you get manipulate material
[0:19:17] <Pallion_> Are you gonna be picking up the secret characters?
[0:19:17] <%supersugoisenpai1> Melee weapon too
[0:19:19] <Valdorick> Atomic Scissors? That's my best move Kappa
[0:19:22] <$Garthunox> melee weapon
[0:19:23] <%AncelDeLambert> doesn't it have double growth?
[0:19:24] <King_Wolf_Rigger> That dude got some arms for them hangers
[0:19:24] <%dheng1> Materia*
[0:19:30] <%Tennochief> Atomic Scissor Sisters
[0:19:49] <majindusto> Its "MAH-TRAH" not MAY-TRAH
[0:19:50] <%moogleboy1984> Barret/Yuffie/Vincent best team
[0:19:52] <%supersugoisenpai1> bye ether
[0:19:52] <$valriot> SPEEDY SPEED BOY
[0:19:54] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat how are you so WEAK?
[0:19:57] <%moogleboy1984> all long range, half damage from physical
[0:19:59] <%Wrashis> ether? im not made of ether!
[0:20:00] <%Owkono> run ruined
[0:20:01] <%Tennochief> JUST WANNA RUN AWAY
[0:20:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> it should be a Tifa move, since she's the brawler and Atomic Scissors is a wrestling move.
[0:20:02] <+Parlux> using emulators...
[0:20:08] <+Scevda> I wonder how the "wah" sound as the enemy disappears was made.
[0:20:18] <+r_Foeburden87> he can go closer to Kalm i think, so long as floor is black
[0:20:19] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Can't get over that chopper.
[0:20:21] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> emulated on the switch
[0:20:21] <mr_slaide> We love you, ELMO!
[0:20:25] <+Parlux> what!!!
[0:20:27] <%AncelDeLambert> there he isssss
[0:20:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Parlux he's playing on Switch
[0:20:31] <$Sir_stride> there it is
[0:20:35] <zamzoph> Does the Steam version have it?
[0:20:39] <%AncelDeLambert> boom
[0:20:41] <+Parlux> GTFO they added a fast forward feature
[0:20:44] <%Anonymasque> That's super thoughtful for an FF7 port to Switch....
[0:20:44] <%supersugoisenpai1> Wrong target
[0:20:48] <majindusto> Nope
[0:20:51] <%moogleboy1984> it has to hit Redbull13
[0:20:51] <%PauliusMaximus> all the switch ports have that
[0:20:54] <%MassConnect> pat that's super wrong
[0:20:54] <Valdorick> Wait until Pat tries to learn Beta instantly.
[0:20:57] <%Ranryu692> the best part of it being a switch port and not an emulator is that the music stays the same speed when you speed up the game
[0:20:58] <Jolnir> How come paige has less health on the sidebar?
[0:21:01] <%AncelDeLambert> Gotta hit whoever has it
[0:21:04] <+Parlux> well I guess I just got BTFO
[0:21:04] <rytisone> steal his robo balls
[0:21:04] <GypsySquid> Noice.
[0:21:06] <$Sir_stride> you didnt get it
[0:21:09] <%wsintai> All the remakes for FFX and FFXII also have fast forwards too
[0:21:12] <Valdorick> @Jolnir Lupas
[0:21:13] <GypsySquid> GET 'EM KNUCKLES
[0:21:15] <%Yadogari> Tifa LUL
[0:21:17] <hippieofdeath> DEFEND!!
[0:21:21] <%AncelDeLambert> not Sanic!
[0:21:24] <%ElenaManetta> Is this game still super long even with sped up functions?
[0:21:26] <ape_hawk> who's this "tifa"?
[0:21:28] <+Parlux> I only played the originals
[0:21:33] <+Scevda> Watch out form them point bits on her knuckles
[0:21:34] <+Parlux> or the emulators lol
[0:21:34] <%sshen> Aerith already has
[0:21:35] <%supersugoisenpai1> why
[0:21:37] <%AncelDeLambert> .... just kill it
[0:21:38] <castlerock42> Even Pat can't commit to his goofy names.
[0:21:40] <%Yadogari> is it going to run out of MP
[0:21:43] <mr_slaide> He's being an asshole.
[0:21:44] <%AncelDeLambert> kill it, try again
[0:21:49] <Jolnir> Is it because shes damaged goods?
[0:21:50] <%CJett92> Calm down, Paige
[0:21:51] <%Tennochief> Nipples do something
[0:21:51] <King_thunder365> Give Tifa the ass-missles skill Kappa
[0:21:55] <$jobbedbone> W means DOUBLE
[0:22:05] <%AncelDeLambert> yaaaaay

[0:22:19] <%AncelDeLambert> alright, moving on
[0:22:20] <xeros720> congrats pat, you beat the game
[0:22:23] <+Parlux> the ff7 remake combat looks good
[0:22:24] <%supersugoisenpai1> Now you don't need any other materia
[0:22:26] <xeros720> (i wish i was joking)
[0:22:28] <%Wrashis> the model is silly
[0:22:31] <%AncelDeLambert> sort by type
[0:22:36] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Look at Clumbo run
[0:22:39] <%Estuko> Make sure it's set to W for WUMBO
[0:22:41] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Man, I was an anime with a chopper that turns into a mecha
[0:22:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Atomic scissors is melee so Barret has to be in the front row to use them.
[0:22:42] <%Yadogari> it's a pair of scissors
[0:22:43] <ape_hawk> what kind of gun arm is "scissors"?
[0:22:44] <%BlackJack607> @AngriestPat I just want you to know that I'm going through some real hard times right now and coming home to your streams is one of the things keeping me sane. So thank you for that.
[0:22:47] <mr_slaide> Why is Elmo the best?
[0:22:48] <+Grayhammatter> clumbo runnin'
[0:22:52] <CrypticMochi> What did he grab?
[0:22:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @ape_hawk Cutman's gun arm.
[0:22:54] <ミュウレ4242> didn't know you could get matra magic so early. it always reminded me of the rocket docks from space station silicon valley.
[0:22:54] <+Parlux> I'm surprised that in 2019 not Alot of FF6 was better comments.
[0:22:54] <%supersugoisenpai1> Use it for fun
[0:23:03] <King_Wolf_Rigger> He run like a Stumbo
[0:23:06] <Jolnir> I hope girls are watching
[0:23:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> is Kalm supposed to be the calm before the storm?
[0:23:06] <+mastertwin2> Clumbo's stumboling across the world
[0:23:10] <%starotter70> It feels weird seeing the base game after playing the modded version
[0:23:10] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat the rest of the enemy skills in the area, you should probably look up a guide for, because they're complicated
[0:23:18] <+Scevda> This is what happens when you don't teach them how to naruto run, they have that running stance
[0:23:21] <%Ranryu692> oh shit
[0:23:23] <+Grayhammatter> uh.. what
[0:23:25] <King_thunder365> Hooray for ass missles!
[0:23:27] <Valdorick> Shoot the missiles out your butt
[0:23:30] <%CJett92> The sound of his Clumbos slapping together keeps alerting the Weapons
[0:23:32] <ape_hawk> redbull gives you ASS MISSILES
[0:23:34] <%MassConnect> great for those parties of 5
[0:23:35] <zamzoph> HIDDEN MISSILES

[0:24:27] <%edgeyberzerker> edgeyberzerker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Recently played this game and I was reminded why this one is held in high regard.
[0:24:28] <+Deathtronhammer> When you get out of Midgar it's such a breath of fresh air
[0:24:28] <%Wrashis> im glad we picked up the low hanging fruit, threw it to the side, and dug up a worm instead for that joke
[0:24:39] <RogueKnightXIII> Ye free stuff
[0:24:39] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Mako energy is what makes Uncle Iroh tick. Literally
[0:24:43] <xeros720> i think montreal sort of cheats it since they had couriers already
[0:24:47] <zamzoph> No way
[0:24:52] <King_Wolf_Rigger> GEE! I wonder why?
[0:24:54] <%Estuko> @King_Wolf_Rigger yeah, it's red's rocket
[0:24:55] <%wsintai> Say no way just to be contrarian
[0:24:55] <CrypticMochi> Give me your tampons, I need them to cure bleed!

[0:25:14] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Estuko Damn, that's a good one.
[0:25:19] <%Tennochief> Strange that we're in Sweeden

[0:25:41] <xeros720> paige just has an extra jenova, it takes control when she drinks
[0:25:43] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Estuko I should have seen it coming...
[0:25:45] <Valdorick> Pat continues the cycle and steals an ether.
[0:25:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I love these thatched house designs. They're always so roomy. Are they Dutch?

[0:28:10] <WhereIsWill> BIG GUN
[0:28:12] <GypsySquid> Still vote Squall for Vincent's name.
[0:28:14] <%starotter70> Vincent = Shadow
[0:28:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You could always switch out party members periodically, and go back to your main team for important stuff
[0:28:14] <+Stereotreme> it couldn't be any other name
[0:28:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Alucard
[0:28:16] <TimetodiveLTX> Alucard
[0:28:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> how did Advent Children come out 14 years ago jesus fuck a dump truck
[0:28:20] <Jolnir> My old man was a minor
[0:28:21] <bashful_bard> Popeye vincent is not edgy
[0:28:23] <TimetodiveLTX> i wjn

[0:28:32] <%Coach_Geary> Coach_Geary subscribed at Tier 1.
[0:28:37] <Valdorick> Accidents!?
[0:28:39] <mankeyfigh> He told Tifa he jammed on it right??
[0:28:41] <%dumemoto> I played this game for the first time last month. I missed getting Vincent and didn't want to continue after that. Nor did I want to restart to get him.
[0:28:41] <%RupanSen> Vincent is a good example of edgy
[0:28:47] <+DeaconBluesClues> me reading r/worldnews
[0:28:55] <EuropanLamprey> Almost like building your city on a single pillar is a bad idea?
[0:28:57] <turqrazor> is this an HD version of the game?
[0:28:59] <$Sir_stride> god avalanche os such a cool name
[0:28:59] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Please tell me SOLDIER is a dumb acronym
[0:29:00] <+Stereotreme> @BlackAce186 Ahead on our Way
[0:29:03] <Valdorick> "I can't believe those terrorists accidently blew up that Mako Reactor."
[0:29:04] <broth_elemental> Vincent Monstermash
[0:29:04] <1matheuw> apparently ff7 and hellsing came out in the same year, huh
[0:29:12] <TimetodiveLTX> such a mood
[0:29:17] <+ProtagonistJake> nice harry potter reference, Pat
[0:29:19] <%starotter70> @turqrazor Mods on PC
[0:29:19] <mankeyfigh> @dumemoto you gotta use the guides like a punk not to miss anything man
[0:29:22] <bashful_bard> Just blow up the reactor 4Head
[0:29:23] <+Grayhammatter> that's a mood
[0:29:27] <+Scevda> @GarbageQueenEllie Its so dumb, it didn't think it was an acronym for most of the hours of my play
[0:29:29] <@commanderclaw> Old man thots
[0:29:30] <%ColonelRozum> @Parlux is there any other way
[0:29:34] <%Wrashis> hey pat, which cartoonishly evil corporation is more cartoonishly evil, shinra or umbrellla?
[0:29:36] <1matheuw> i was about to do a stupid vincent and alucard joke but google ruined it
[0:29:37] <ミュウレ4242> hellsing ultimate kicked so much ass.
[0:29:43] <%Wrashis> in your opinion
[0:29:43] <%wsintai> @1matheuw But the porn doujin that Proto-Alucard appeared in came out a few years before Kappa
[0:29:43] <thelonechris> Cidgar
[0:29:50] <+DeaconBluesClues> is it floating?
[0:29:50] <+BlackAce186> @Stereotreme Thank you
[0:29:59] <EuropanLamprey> It's a shithole though
[0:29:59] <1matheuw> @wsintai the true alucard then
[0:30:05] <%AdmiralButtloaf> YOU CAN SEE lT FROM HERE
[0:30:09] <%Tennochief> """""Smart""""""
[0:30:10] <+Dingo_Eejit> @Wrashis Shin Brolly
[0:30:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> That's Fake News, son
[0:30:18] <%corepool> them avawhatsits
[0:30:20] <%Owkono> can you plug yourself in to power your car in this world?
[0:30:29] <+Grayhammatter> an item?
[0:30:32] <%goose_attack_almanac> Potion Seller
[0:30:34] <+Parlux> oh man who remembers jackin it to early hentai pics of ff7 and ff8 on a 56k modem. good times
[0:30:36] <+Scevda> Store person: "This is the item store"
[0:30:43] <Valdorick> "I hear all the fossil fuels near the drills are being sucked dry... huh, we're better off with Oil anyway."
[0:30:44] <mr_slaide> I can't wait to have a pee powered car.
[0:30:47] <bashful_bard> Par no
[0:30:51] <rytisone> "but we need that argent energy, doomguy"
[0:30:51] <+Grayhammatter> potion seller?
[0:30:52] <%Tennochief> I didn't
[0:31:00] <%Owkono> 3 steals is good
[0:31:08] <TimetodiveLTX> taking 10 minutes to load strip snake
[0:31:10] <%starotter70> Having Heal and Cure swapped in this game fucks with me
[0:31:10] <+Parlux> @bashful_bard Huh, no I can't be the only guy?
[0:31:12] <EuropanLamprey> Why can't we just power our cars off the Aether?
[0:31:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I'd love to see a generator that's powered by lewd thoughts.
[0:31:15] <%Ilpala> @Parlux MargeIt'sTrueButHeShouldn'tSayIt.gif
[0:31:19] <+ProtagonistJake> I always found it really uninspired that they were selling spells and shit but there werent gangs of materia users or materia being treat like drugs with their healing properties or whatever
[0:31:20] <+DeaconBluesClues> @parlux I honestly don't remember if I ever did but I can't remember NOT jacking it so it's probably 50/50
[0:31:21] <%AncelDeLambert> steal is a BITCH in this game
[0:31:24] <%RupanSen> eh
[0:31:30] <%AncelDeLambert> yet somehow stealing in 9 is worse, can't explain that
[0:31:30] <amused_platypus> Pat Pat have you been watching Plagues ff14 streams
[0:31:30] <ミュウレ4242> why can't we render animal fat into petroleum?
[0:31:32] <+Grayhammatter> i wouldn't
[0:31:33] <Valdorick> @GarbageQueenEllie My god, weebs alone would save the planet.
[0:31:33] <%CJett92> Thats a mistake

[0:32:23] <CrypticMochi> WATANABE!
[0:32:26] <+DeaconBluesClues> @angriestpat is using 'steal' a lootbox mechanic
[0:32:28] <@StridentSong> @AngriestPat The next major thing you can miss, like permanently, is the Shinra Beta off the soldiers on the boat. Before then, anything you can steal can be gotten through other means
[0:32:29] <%MagickBurritoh> edging HARD
[0:32:29] <+Parlux> put the steal metra on barett... Oh come on you all did it
[0:32:37] <$Sir_stride> yup. you shouldn't need to swap up until junon or a little later
[0:32:38] <mankeyfigh> GO BACK AND STEAL ATOMIC SCISSORS FOR BARRETT
[0:32:40] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I loved Wutai's new album, Protect Ya Neck

[0:32:50] <+Scevda> ff
[0:32:52] <%AdmiralButtloaf> atomic scissors are better than cannonball
[0:32:57] <mr_slaide> He got the atomic scissors, nerd.
[0:33:04] <mankeyfigh> @wsintai stream luck
[0:33:08] <%AdmiralButtloaf> i know dork
[0:33:10] <+Stereotreme> atomic scissors is melee though
[0:33:19] <+Scevda> FUCK RM
[0:33:21] <+Parlux> this game needs more blitz ball or triple triad. amiriteguys?
[0:33:22] <rytisone> time for story time
[0:33:23] <mr_slaide> Not talking to you, geek.
[0:33:25] <%Wrashis> hes never gonna use barrett anyway
[0:33:27] <%AdmiralButtloaf> lol
[0:33:32] <castlerock42> Everybody settle in for one of the longest flashbacks in a video game.
[0:33:32] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I feel like Atomic Scissors is a sex thing.
[0:33:34] <alrobot2014> needs more tetra master actually
[0:33:36] <+Stereotreme> what self-respecting gun arm would use a melee weapon?
[0:33:39] <$Sir_stride> and here comes the pacing killer ResidentSleeper
[0:33:39] <%Edgy_Macaroon> story time
[0:33:39] <%starotter70> Just call me Clumbo
[0:33:47] <mr_slaide> Bringing a fist to a gun fight.
[0:33:52] <zamzoph> TRAGIC BACKSTORY
[0:33:57] <TimetodiveLTX> kept you waiting, huh
[0:33:59] <%Tennochief> Band of heroes they all are
[0:34:06] <%Wrashis> time to control sephiroth for 1 whole battle
[0:34:11] <broth_elemental> I was buying you presents
[0:34:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @King_Wolf_Rigger You can only get the weapon if you leave Tifa and Aerith alone together for a while...
[0:34:20] <zamzoph> Cloud's fanfic
[0:34:22] <mankeyfigh> Oh he explored the town before backstory, that explains my confusion
[0:34:28] <+Grayhammatter> one day
[0:34:30] <$sl8r4l8r> Sephiroth punched me in the face once. It was awesome.
[0:34:30] <+Parlux> oh the story where clumbo is a psycho path
[0:34:32] <+0oki> I wished remake would end after first flashback
[0:34:34] <rytisone> good 'ol MY memories
[0:34:38] <%dheng1> When cloud tells everyone he’s Zack
[0:34:52] <+Parlux> Clumbos "Memories"
[0:34:55] <%toastybites> i just dropped in but somehow the character names make so much sense
[0:34:55] <ミュウレ4242> sephiroth aniki is so dreamy.
[0:34:56] <Meekest> Wow look at these main characters
[0:34:56] <%Wrashis> cloud is 21
[0:35:01] <zamzoph> look at Cloud being a cool guy
[0:35:03] <%Wrashis> suck his dick, 21
[0:35:05] <+DeaconBluesClues> look at these cobra commander jobbers
[0:35:09] <misterspotswood> remember when cloud just lies on accident?
[0:35:09] <EuropanLamprey> AH, the "turn your back to the people you're expositioning to" trope
[0:35:11] <aimlesshealer> I wonder who are the main characters here
[0:35:14] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie lol
[0:35:15] <%wsintai> *Tifa shuffles in increasing discomfort*
[0:35:16] <%SilvaChariot0133> /squat

[0:35:35] <Pallion_> the squats
[0:35:37] <+DeaconBluesClues> SQUATS

[0:35:38] <%dheng1> Cloud is such a nerd
[0:35:40] <soraabora> ah fucking yeah squat time
[0:35:46] <Valdorick> I can't believe that small child from FFX created a oligarchy that helps kill the planet. #WakkaDidNothingWrong #RaceWarAl-Bed
[0:35:48] <rytisone> Clumbo squats
[0:35:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> +
[0:35:54] <Sokumotanaka> Cloud's fan fiction
[0:36:00] <+ProtagonistJake> I always wandered why Zach in KH BBS did those syupid squats every sentence
[0:36:05] <+ProtagonistJake> wondered*
[0:36:05] <+DeaconBluesClues> MISTER
[0:36:07] <%Tennochief> The War Economy needs to continue CLoud
[0:36:07] <Basch71> neeeerd
[0:36:09] <%Nope80808> "we wore the exact same clothes back in the army" -Clumbo "Arent you suppose to have uniforms?" - Ass4days "Arent you supposed to shut up" - Clumbo
[0:36:15] <soraabora> please, mr sephorath was my father
[0:36:16] <1matheuw> stop sucking that dick cloud
[0:36:28] <%goose_attack_almanac> He's trying so hard to impress Knuckles
[0:36:32] <+Parlux> You know what would be even a more mind fuck. if cloud went through the entire game thinking he's Zach and mourning his friend cloud just to find out he's cloud. that would be dark.
[0:36:39] <%Estuko> nibblehiem uwu

[0:39:48] <+stuntdoublejesus> "Hey Za--ahem.... Cloud."
[0:39:49] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Also in that fight earlier, Cloud was a higher level than you are now. Why is he way weaker now?
[0:39:49] <misterspotswood> wonder who that random soldier is?
[0:39:51] <%logoth_> I do that pose all the time
[0:39:51] <$El_Desperad0> You're giving them way too much credit
[0:39:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Parlux Cloud is the guy that was puking in the truck. Cloud is pretending he is Zach in this flashback.
[0:39:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> Who?
[0:39:53] <misterspotswood> hmmmmmm
[0:39:53] <Desertfishing> no this game is perfect no mistakes what so ever

[1:04:39] <TastySammiches> go get em, clumbo
[1:04:41] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Sephiroth, acting like he's not a MASSIVE bitch
[1:04:42] <+TheSaintJohn> he had that convo dead
[1:04:43] <+Parlux> lol
[1:04:43] <Make_me_mad> Sephiroth not even gonna bother reviving that.
[1:04:45] <Make_me_mad> Waste of time.
[1:04:50] <+valkuma> i like the idea of cloud sliding around facedown on the ground between fights
[1:04:52] <Valdorick> No don't go in there Clumbo! That's where Hojo makes his Ugly Bastards for his porn!
[1:04:55] <rytisone> Sephiroth just drags Clumbos dead weight ass around
[1:04:57] <$sl8r4l8r> And then I spontaneously died a 3rd time
[1:04:58] <%starotter70> Sephiroth walks like he has a big steppy in this flashback
[1:04:58] <%dheng1> That tickles -sephiroth
[1:04:59] <Ner234> I can't believe Clumbo is fucking DEAD.
[1:05:01] <EuropanLamprey> *checks pulse* "Yep, still dead"
[1:05:01] <+bobfriskit> Sephiroth is just dragging Clouds dead body around
[1:05:06] <%Starlight_Gamer> oh Clumbo
[1:05:07] <itsdavid125> The victory music over Clumbo's corpse
[1:05:08] <%RupanSen> it shows off how cool Cloud is
[1:05:13] <Desertfishing> spicy butthole
[1:05:17] <%Tennochief> "I was going to fight with Sephiroth, but then I fell tripped over myself and died"
[1:05:24] <InugamiTheHound> Sephihiroth has to drag Cloud around
[1:05:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Aren't those alcoholic baby wipes
[1:05:28] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Now THAT'S a spicy meatball
[1:05:31] <zamzoph> @RupanSen Cloud is definitely the coolest guy ever
[1:05:32] <%cureneckbeard> You're down, you've no more estus
[1:05:34] <+Parlux> Crisis core was dope for this part
[1:05:34] <+Someitalian123> Something about entering a fight with Cloud just fucking dead on the ground is funny to me
[1:05:36] <jellssssss20> Clumbo, you wait here.
[1:05:41] <%Starlight_Gamer> Sephy carry
[1:05:44] <CrypticMochi> Clumbo’s corpse is storage like a Fallout corpse
[1:05:45] <jellssssss20> Your dead ass won’t fit through the door
[1:05:48] <%dheng1> Knuckles your tits are too big for this door
[1:05:58] <InugamiTheHound> Cloud=dead weight!
[1:06:04] <mr_slaide> She wants that class D
[1:06:04] <%wsintai> KappaPride
[1:06:04] <Desertfishing> seduce him!
[1:06:05] <+Zerodyne90> rgtSmile
[1:06:07] <+Parlux> I'm surprised seph didn't say "Nah you can stay clumbo I rather take knuckles"
[1:06:09] <%RupanSen> apatSmug
[1:06:10] <mr_slaide> EMLOOOOOOO
[1:06:10] <Ner234> LEWD

[1:06:28] <%cureneckbeard> BUT!
[1:06:35] <+r_Foeburden87> MEga ran song time
[1:06:35] <%moogleboy1984> and then Gackt came by and read about a play or some stupid shit and ruined the lore forever. ~The End~
[1:06:41] <%galaxyswirl> how does cloud know wat happens in here
[1:06:42] <%connos_procrastination> weekend at bernies Cloud around

[1:06:45] <%starotter70> What do you mean?
[1:06:45] <+Parlux> wait a sec how does cloud have his metal hand in a flash back?
[1:06:46] <WhereIsWill> this building is SO UNSAFE OMG
[1:06:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> doodNuts M-Muther.....
[1:06:49] <Valdorick> @moogleboy1984 Fucking crisis core.
[1:06:51] <%salty_syd913> apatBig evil
[1:06:52] <InugamiTheHound> why is Jenova only in this mako reactor?
[1:06:57] <Thalchampz> reminds me of the XIV stuff where they locked Krile
[1:06:58] <King_Wolf_Rigger> It seems like poor engineering if you have climb down a fuckin chain to progress.
[1:06:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Parlux He doesn't have a metal hand lol.
[1:07:00] <reonome> wow seph why does this thing have the same name as your mom
[1:07:00] <Desertfishing> how did none of the people from the village never come up here
[1:07:03] <WhereIsWill> open gears that anyone can poke their arm in!?
[1:07:10] <+Parlux> yeah he does
[1:07:11] <Desertfishing> no guards and the door wide open
[1:07:11] <+Draylle> i love how silly Sephiroth looks peeking like a child into the pod
[1:07:12] <%dheng1> I hate genesis just an excuse to add gackt
[1:07:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Parlux That's supposed to be an armband.
[1:07:14] <Dementedpenguin> @moogleboy1984 jesus goddamn christ I forgot about Gackt until you mentioned him NotLikeThis
[1:07:16] <%starotter70> I love that Seph has to hoist himself up
[1:07:20] <+Parlux> ohhh
[1:07:20] <%Starlight_Gamer> didnt know solder was just maintenance
[1:07:23] <%wsintai> @Parlux Just a cool glove
[1:07:27] <mr_slaide> Gast sucked.
[1:07:32] <+Parlux> wait did he never have a metal hand?
[1:07:38] <%starotter70> oh right.... Gast....
[1:07:44] <%AncelDeLambert> Sephiroth crit failed his will save RIGHT here
[1:07:44] <zamzoph> @starotter70 I look forward to that in the highly-detailed remake LUL
[1:07:44] <GizmoKSX> Condensed Mako, evaporated Mako, skim Mako

[1:08:10] <Ner234> monkaS
[1:08:17] <+Parlux> no way I remembered him having a metal hand
[1:08:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's just that over time they've made his armband look dumber and tighter, so people think it's a metal hand instead.
[1:08:24] <InugamiTheHound> @T3merity that you for that info.
[1:08:26] <%Owkono> mako makes you 2D
[1:08:27] <%connos_procrastination> Mister smiles ye from remako

[1:08:57] <TimetodiveLTX> Uh ohhhh
[1:08:57] <zamzoph> REEEEE
[1:09:00] <%AncelDeLambert> complete NUT
[1:09:02] <Jolnir> oooooooooh sephy its way worse than you think
[1:09:02] <InugamiTheHound> This were Genesis comes and tells Sephiroth the truth
[1:09:06] <HeadsHeldHigh> he fucking loses itt
[1:09:07] <Ion_Laser> mmmmuther
[1:09:08] <%connos_procrastination> creating monsters is Shin-rad
[1:09:09] <GizmoKSX> Sephiroth, you clearly don't have tentacle head.
[1:09:11] <%SilvaChariot0133> doodNuts MUTHER
[1:09:12] <%AncelDeLambert> IMMEDIATE mental breakdown
[1:09:12] <$sl8r4l8r> SEPHIROTH I JUST FIXED THAT YOU PRICK
[1:09:18] <+Shadicara> Pussy
[1:09:19] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Like a lil BITCH
[1:09:20] <%logoth_> Proximity to Jenova though
[1:09:21] <Dementedpenguin> Thanks Sephiroth, What a hero. Kappa
[1:09:22] <DirgeNovak> Sephiroth having a Vivi moment here
[1:09:23] <machshop> maybe it's because he's an unstable monster baby
[1:09:23] <%dheng1> so Zack planted the seeds of doubt in sephiroth
[1:09:25] <+Draylle> yeah, that could have gone better. it confused me the first time
[1:09:27] <%Tennochief> this music fits the mood pretty well
[1:09:28] <%cherubs_anonymous> Are we sure this game is good?
[1:09:29] <+FoolsArcade> They put all the buildup in crisis core I think
[1:09:31] <%connos_procrastination> thin veil of sanity on the feller
[1:09:33] <mr_slaide> WE SEEZ HIM
[1:09:35] <+stagemage> people always forget how fucking broke sepiroth was
[1:09:35] <rytisone> It was probably just a final drop
[1:09:36] <%FoulNightingale> IT's not so much that, but Jenova's influence.
[1:09:40] <%galaxyswirl> geez, i feel bad for sephi
[1:09:40] <mankeyfigh> HES BEEN STRUGGLING WITH IT FOR A WHILE
[1:09:42] <EuropanLamprey> A person that snaps that easily was never stable
[1:09:42] <+OkamiDude15> quick time event FAILED
[1:09:42] <+asgard147> Awwwwwwww limesLove
[1:09:45] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> The mo
[1:09:47] <InugamiTheHound> They expanded this scene in crisis core
[1:09:50] <%mastertwin2> Yo at least Angeal kinda took it like a champ
[1:09:50] <%gespenst25> could that just be because of the 1997 video game writing @angriestpat ?
[1:09:50] <TimetodiveLTX> >:(
[1:09:50] <+Draylle> dey he iz
[1:09:55] <%FoulNightingale> The Japanese version explains more.
[1:09:56] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> I would think there would be implied build-up of doubt off-screen.
[1:09:57] <%starotter70> apatPorgmo
[1:09:57] <%cureneckbeard> like mami-san
[1:10:02] <mr_slaide> We love you, emlo!!!
[1:10:03] <%Tennochief> sassy cat
[1:10:04] <+asgard147> he so sassy limesGiggle
[1:10:06] <%MassConnect> yeah, he was suspicious of his obvious op-ness
[1:10:12] <%Tennochief> CLumbo stop
[1:10:15] <Valdorick> Its International Cat day, he can be as Sassy as he wants.
[1:10:20] <%connos_procrastination> I don't count crisis core as cannon
[1:10:21] <Jolnir> in 1997 this game was dark and gritty
[1:10:21] <+Shadicara> Hooman
[1:10:25] <%cureneckbeard> wait where did the burrito go? it got replaced with elmo when I wasn't looking
[1:10:27] <%starotter70> After all the saturation his character gets in other games, it's cool to see Seph's actual break down
[1:10:27] <+OkamiDude15> NotLikeThis
[1:10:30] <%dheng1> Stop being a dick clumbo
[1:10:32] <+Parlux> I like to think FF7 was inspired by berserk
[1:10:33] <%Tennochief> fuck
[1:10:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @connos_procrastination Why? It's very canon.
[1:10:37] <zamzoph> NotLikeThis
[1:10:38] <Valdorick> "Oh no, I MIGHT be a monster! Time to start a doomsday plot!"
[1:10:40] <miendrh93> I mean, he didn't tooootally snap. He's throwing a tantrum, but still got himself pulled together enough to research for a week.
[1:10:41] <reonome> monkaS

[1:11:01] <+Shadicara> No pat you're not human Kappa
[1:11:12] <%Nobrev> fighting those monsters in crisis core was intense
[1:11:13] <%Tennochief> but you always hate Shinra
[1:11:13] <%AncelDeLambert> The writing is so perfect, it's a slow, yet intense burn on the plot making Hojo the REAL villain of the story
[1:11:15] <%MassConnect> boo Shinra. Redbull > monsters
[1:11:16] <%FloppytoKey> if you want to see more of Sephs slow downfall into madness, i refer you to the superior FF7 experience, Crisis Core
[1:11:18] <miendrh93> I just assumed that once he started figuring it out, especially in proximity to Jenova, she was able to ramp up the degree of psychic contamination she had on him.
[1:11:19] <Valdorick> Pat's not a Human, he's a Moonman.
[1:11:23] <Jolnir> the fucking names
[1:11:24] <rytisone> Sephiroth is subhuman
[1:11:31] <+Shadicara> REDBULL 13
[1:11:33] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> You cannot kill him
[1:11:36] <+Parlux> back in my day shinra was a 8 year old boy on a Al bhed ship
[1:11:41] <%connos_procrastination> my mantra = is it good yes cannon is it bad yes non cannon
[1:11:41] <%Wrashis> saved on the 69th floor
[1:11:43] <$sl8r4l8r> Sephiroth is omega
[1:11:45] <+Shadicara> What a name
[1:11:48] <%Wrashis> nice
[1:11:49] <%Eaglestrike117> Hmmm Knuck;es, why you acting weird?
[1:11:50] <miendrh93> Granted, with the level of information you have right now, it's just kind of meh writing, because it's a 1997 vidya
[1:11:51] <%Xooler67> Where's voresaliva?
[1:12:03] <%starotter70> Knuckles: "What the fuck is he talking about!?"

[1:13:39] <+Shadicara> sp00ky cave
[1:13:42] <%nmaten> this is a sex dungeon
[1:13:42] <Valdorick> @WhereIsWill Pat talked to Tifa 100 times in prison, so likely Red13
[1:13:42] <%Wrashis> shrina vs umbrella
[1:13:45] <asurite_warrior> so where we at?
[1:13:47] <InugamiTheHound> look at all skeletons for Paige
[1:13:47] <DirgeNovak> It's almost as if this bit is nonsensical drivel or something 🤔🤔
[1:13:47] <%AbnormalVoid> Hmmmmmmmm
[1:13:48] <%starotter70> Probably nothing
[1:13:48] <TastySammiches> probably dio
[1:13:49] <%jerree66> @Too_Much_Nukie oh shit my bad
[1:13:50] <%RupanSen> DIO, probably
[1:13:50] <T3merity> casual human skulls all over the basement at shinra manor
[1:13:50] <%Wrashis> which is more cartoonishly evil
[1:13:54] <+bobfriskit> is it a ghost?
[1:13:54] <%Owkono> DIO
[1:13:57] <Jolnir> cool guy enough to have his OWN game
[1:14:00] <+OkamiDude15> @asurite_warrior nibelheim flashback
[1:14:00] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Does Seph change form into Cloud and visa/versa?
[1:14:03] <%ElenaManetta> Evil is relative. Your basement is stone-walled and has a skeleton in it!
[1:14:03] <%Eaglestrike117> This is the Kalm flashback, AKA the start of the 2nd remake game
[1:14:03] <Sokumotanaka> @AngriestPat What are you gonna name Hot topic there?
[1:14:05] <%MassConnect> XXX
[1:14:07] <+Parlux> OHHHHH name vincint Dio!!!!
[1:14:13] <Darkfire346> I like how Jenova is basically The Thing
[1:14:15] <$sl8r4l8r> ........wrrrrrryyyyyy.........
[1:14:23] <rytisone> Reading some mangas, I see
[1:14:26] <asurite_warrior> thx
[1:14:28] <DirgeNovak> There's already a character called Dio
[1:14:31] <%Starlight_Gamer> i remember x year like it was yesterday
[1:14:32] <%RupanSen> Btw DIO is actually in the game
[1:14:32] <Jolnir> name him rawrxD
[1:14:32] <%AncelDeLambert> We're naming Vincent "Donte" and none of you can stop it
[1:14:34] <rsg220> This Sephiroth fellow sure seems like he's up to no good
[1:14:35] <%starotter70> Yup
[1:14:35] <%radda343> that angle is dutch as fuck
[1:14:35] <Frostydough> Is Sephiroth just Jenova 2: Electric Boogaloo?
[1:14:36] <reonome> @King_Wolf_Rigger you are guessing too hard lmao
[1:14:36] <+Shadicara> shirtless in the rain
[1:14:36] <%MagickBurritoh> WHAT
[1:14:37] <Valdorick> No no, Not Dio, what's one of the punk bitch Vampire's that don't matter?
[1:14:42] <zamzoph> Jenova's a popular name
[1:14:43] <%Xooler67> @sokumotanaka how. about mychemicalromance
[1:14:47] <mr_slaide> He died a really, really stupid death.
[1:14:47] <majindusto> Name Vincent "Alucard"
[1:14:48] <rhus> yes :) it's all coincidence :)
[1:14:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Why don't you cry about your mommy some more, Seph?
[1:14:51] <Darkfire346> I wish they'd put some more Thing references in the remake
[1:14:51] <%moogleboy1984> yo, I miss The Jenova Project. RIP them and the Minibosses

[1:15:10] <Sokumotanaka> @Xooler67 You aint pat
[1:15:10] <%Maids4lyfe> Jenova means New God
[1:15:12] <%Eaglestrike117> He binged it all in a week
[1:15:12] <Valdorick> So then... He's a Jenova Witness?

[1:15:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> If there's a punk bitch here, it's clearly Sephiroth
[1:15:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's not Jenova's Witness it's Jehova.
[1:15:36] <ミュウレ4242> this is a kind of lovecraftian backstory.
[1:15:37] <TastySammiches> jehovah's more of an old testament thing

[1:15:46] <wookie5358> Not ominous music at all. Everything will totally be fine
[1:15:47] <%AncelDeLambert> no. JeHOvah was the shitty german translation of god's name
[1:15:48] <Darkfire346> awwwwww shieeeeet it's the crazy music
[1:15:50] <InugamiTheHound> @zamzoph fuk yeah I love VG cats!
[1:15:51] <rytisone> Why send Sephiroth on a mission where he could discover something like that?
[1:15:51] <mankeyfigh> EVIL MUSIC

[1:16:44] <Make_me_mad> See this could have been a heartwarming story where the Soldier team helped Sephiroth come to terms with his dark past and they go on a journey to take down Shinra together.
[1:16:44] <asurite_warrior> never gonna get those childhood feelings back.
[1:16:45] <+asgard147> doodNuts

[1:16:53] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Does Seph become one with the life stream and then inhabit Cloud's body? Come on, I gotta be getting close.
[1:16:54] <Make_me_mad> Instead they left him in a basement to have a breakdown for a week.
[1:16:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> looks like someone got into the alcohol
[1:17:00] <%AncelDeLambert> They're all going to laugh at you, Sephiroth, they're all going to laugh at you!
[1:17:06] <Dementedpenguin> Kappa
[1:17:09] <rhus> I like that phrasing. They "disliked the journey".
[1:17:18] <wookie5358> Plot twist! Sephiroth is just a angry mommy's boy
[1:17:24] <Valdorick> Sometimes I like to think that some guy at Square is in a constant state of mental panic at everyone saying Jenova with a hard J. That he's just always in his own mind going "But the J was suppose to be silent."
[1:17:25] <redial_nick> he was a "traitor" not too long ago
[1:17:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @King_Wolf_Rigger You're not.
[1:17:26] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Oh no, Sephiroth has created a Tumblr account!

[1:18:03] <rytisone> The Ultimate Bioweapon
[1:18:03] <Valdorick> Now fly away, Sephiroth! Fly away for reason!
[1:18:04] <Jolnir> "...yeh..."

[1:19:19] <GypsySquid> Sephiroth's hella wrong, though.
[1:19:20] <42nfl19> @angriestpat is sepheroth a villian due to just bad circumstances? or was he always an asshole?

[1:19:51] <Heyestus> SOLDIER Sephiroth seemed pretty chill.
[1:19:51] <%averyoddjew> the answer is yes
[1:19:53] <%Maids4lyfe> he's genetically predisposed for evil
[1:19:53] <rmwolfe> the cetra themselves arent aliens, its just weird phrasing
[1:19:54] <King_thunder365> He wasn't ALWAYS an asshole, according to Crisis Core.

[1:20:00] <%AncelDeLambert> he runs HARD with it
[1:20:01] <Sokumotanaka> Crisis core would tell you he was chill
[1:20:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Seph's got such a weak little mind. You tell him ONE bit of bad news, and he torches the whole town.
[1:20:07] <%Maids4lyfe> Jenova is intelligent cancer
[1:20:08] <%Ranryu692> lol that's one way to put it
[1:20:08] <%TheSniperJoe> Basically Homelander from "The Boys".

[1:21:30] <%Kataguro> I hope she gets this outfit in 7R
[1:21:33] <xUrbanCarnage> ￼
[1:21:33] <Ner234> THere is a reason why an entire generation of online usernames had the name "Itachi" or "Sephiroth" in it LUL
[1:21:33] <cisealnine> @Darkfire346 it's too late, they have already gotten past this point in FF7MA
[1:21:35] <%AncelDeLambert> AND THE CHILDREN! I slaughtered them like ANIMALS!

[1:22:05] <bear_breaker20> not dead somehow
[1:22:05] <%RupanSen> Tifa's tits saved her here
[1:22:06] <%Kataguro> The fall probably did more damage
[1:22:06] <Valdorick> Just punch the sword, idiot.
[1:22:07] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> So now she has a scar across her tiddies
[1:22:09] <Sokumotanaka> How does she have no scar who knows
[1:22:09] <hippieofdeath> You did it Tifa
[1:22:10] <%connos_procrastination> Karl Urban deserves more roles
[1:22:11] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Home run Sephiroth

[1:22:30] <%ElenaManetta> Women are sturdy, you can throw them around with virtually no injuries
[1:22:30] <Valdorick> Dude yeets dragons in 2 hits, and she tanks a hit at negative level 1
[1:22:30] <Sokumotanaka> It's case she's a mary sue

[1:23:29] <Basch71> anything Hojo handles has to be blatantly evil
[1:23:29] <%AncelDeLambert> less talky, more stabby
[1:23:32] <Make_me_mad> The horrible umbilical cord is icing on the cake.

[1:28:57] <Koosahmii> I want when you use PHS in the remake you call them up and they appear in some over the top cutscene like in dmc5
[1:29:01] <mankeyfigh> @angriestpat In case you were wondering just what PHS stands for: It’s Party Hensei System, and Hensei means editing. A funny thing about the abbreviation of PHS is that it also stands for Personal Handiphone System in Japan, or simply a cellphone!
[1:29:05] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @King_thunder365 ohhh okay. Never played this, most of what I know is stuff pat's said on the podcast
[1:29:10] <%salty_syd913> how do you level up materia
[1:29:11] <theKingRamses> when it maxes out you get a copy
[1:29:12] <%ElenaManetta> There was something Pat said about there going to be a big problem with the flashbacks in Remake and I don't remember what or why

[1:30:58] <%Ranryu692> Why would people have cats, then?
[1:30:59] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat okay, there's two enemy skills coming up, but they suck, so ignore them. Also, one is a pain in the ass to get anyways.
[1:31:00] <%RupanSen> they're kinda rare tbf
[1:31:01] <rytisone> just like all people are jerks
[1:31:02] <@BigNaturalMan59> what up pyat

[1:31:12] <Heyestus> this i why you get children pets.
[1:31:12] <%Cthulos> nah, your friends were just shitty cat parents
[1:31:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> The first cat I interacted with was an outdoor cat that walked right up to me, purring. I was super lucky
[1:31:14] <@lewdskeletor13> Cats are gods gift to humanity
[1:31:15] <12gagerager> Were they all siamese cats?
[1:31:25] <%Puhff> I will never understand why people keep asshole cats that don't even hunt mice
[1:31:30] <12gagerager> Those ones seem to dislike the hell out of people.
[1:31:31] <+BoboDaHobo> exactly how I felt about cats too, I say while petting my cat
[1:31:31] <%Owkono> just get the chest shots

[1:31:40] <Lotharman> My cat hunts me...
[1:31:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat You can get the chocobo enemy skill already if you buy the most expensive greens. Don't recommend doing it on-stream though.
[1:31:45] <+Indigo_909> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, first of all I'm a really big fan of you and your work. Recently I finished building my computer after 3 years of dealing with an old and busted shit, and I've been so happy ever since I accomplished it. What's the biggest achievement that you've ever hit to make you feel ecstatic? Also Lazy Elmo is best Elmo.
[1:31:45] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat They'll just zoom in on her tits
[1:31:56] <Ner234> "You're full of shit Cloud"
[1:31:56] <%Kataguro> I hate its human hands, ugh

[1:32:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But Tifa's already known Cloud is all fucked up somehow
[1:32:08] <majindusto> Time to get Choco-Mog!!!
[1:32:08] <frozenprince18> @AngriestPat I like that they keep Cloud as a snarky little brat for the remake before he BSOD's, it helps throw people off who haven't gone through this yet about who he REALLY is.

[1:32:30] <Sokumotanaka> @rytisone Pets and humans are vastly different. Like pets don't shoot places up cause a girl didn't want to bang them or become racist or just plain horrible
[1:32:36] <miendrh93> Honestly, ain't nobody getting spoiled at this point. I kind of want Tifa's reaction to be a small, non-vocal "uhh....what?"
[1:32:40] <@BigNaturalMan59> whys clouds sword the big stubbo
[1:32:40] <%Chocolatevgz> btw I love that when there's a critical hit, there's a big ol' flash on Pat's cam

[1:53:25] <thegreenbenis> Yuffie is garbage
[1:53:26] <rytisone> but mindgoblins
[1:53:26] <shiny_prinny> i mean, the early game isn't too hard, i think he'll be fine
[1:53:27] <$jobbedbone> Matra is based on an aerospace company
[1:53:28] <dailylifewithry> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:53:29] <TioXyco> will you not really? what about the final battle?
[1:53:29] <%ElenaManetta> I'm not even super familiar with FF and I know that made a lot of people mad
[1:53:31] <%Tennochief> Call her Weeb Trash
[1:53:31] <%kujofire990> BOOM
[1:53:34] <Djinnazz> she's got that D'blow weapon though.
[1:53:34] <asurite_warrior> do your other characters level out of combat?
[1:53:37] <GypsySquid> She's good for grinding Sources aboard that submarine.
[1:53:39] <Tucker0603> HERESY
[1:53:40] <reinbachthe3rd> My squad used to be Cloud, Yuffie and Cid.
[1:53:40] <%starotter70> Kind of a mix
[1:53:42] <%enickma11> Why use the Yuffster when Papi Barret is always there?
[1:53:42] <majindusto> Yuffie is Great, SHUT UP
[1:53:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> kinda KH
[1:53:51] <wookie5358> Her clear tranquil is okay for a replacement to Aerith when she gets [REDACTED]
[1:53:51] <%ColonelRozum> @lewdskeletor13 did you not watch the gameplay?
[1:53:53] <%Kataguro> Green incoming
[1:53:56] <%supersugoisenpai1> I love Yuffie, change my mind
[1:53:59] <%MassConnect> Yuffie is great for one thing
[1:53:59] <sosuke5> It's sort of similar to KH3 specifically
[1:54:00] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> yuffie is great. great at sucking
[1:54:01] <dailylifewithry> Yuffie is actually so fun to use, wtf?
[1:54:03] <%AncelDeLambert> someone open up the yuffie get guide, cuz we'll need it shortly
[1:54:03] <mankeyfigh> FORT CONDor let’s gettit
[1:54:05] <@lewdskeletor13> @colonelrozum Nope I’m not super into FF
[1:54:10] <rytisone> first time I played this game I completely missed Yuffie
[1:54:12] <Louie_Salmon> Basically KH, minus all the nonsense mechanics
[1:54:12] <reinbachthe3rd> FORT CONDOR
[1:54:14] <King_thunder365> Yuffie's great for source farming if you get her The Conformer and a "Morph" materia. It's also great for getting a character with a max damage melee attack earlier than everyone else.
[1:54:15] <%MassConnect> one thing that pat won't do
[1:54:18] <+gamesasacervix> yuffie is one of the strongest party members
[1:54:24] <%Wrashis> this party is the party for the rest of the game people
[1:54:26] <%Darren716> I know its just her hair but Tiffa/Paige's portrait looks like it has a muppet mouth
[1:54:28] <%Owkono> Yuffie is a morph machine with her final weapon
[1:54:28] <%AncelDeLambert> yuffie is HELLA strong
[1:54:29] <%Dingus_Tickler> Okay, but how big will the numbers be when I fill the gauge? atpCap
[1:54:31] <theKingRamses> @lewdskeletor13 it's gonna be like an action game(think ff15) but with slow mo when you wanna use special abilities
[1:54:32] <mr_slaide> Yes?
[1:54:40] <artoflec> I am gonna miss not having Warp Strike...I hope they'll give us something similar since you can't jump in 7 Remake
[1:54:44] <%Faustgesicht> exactly 1,000 people
[1:54:46] <mr_slaide> Good.
[1:54:47] <+without_borders> Too proud to use the slots exploit?
[1:54:48] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:54:48] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[1:54:48] <%Faustgesicht> dammit
[1:54:49] <EuropanLamprey> Here's my question *silence*
[1:54:50] <+Draylle> yes patty cake?
[1:54:51] <%ElenaManetta> in THE TWO SECONDS
[1:54:52] <@lewdskeletor13> @darren716 Paige IS a muppet
[1:54:57] <GizmoKSX> Yes
[1:54:57] <%AncelDeLambert> She IS the fight
[1:54:57] <%SilvaChariot0133> she should jsut show up
[1:54:58] <wookie5358> She's her own fitght
[1:55:01] <rytisone> I think it's later in the game
[1:55:03] <asurite_warrior> honestly ff7 is good in that all party member are honestly good and viable
[1:55:03] <%ColonelRozum> @lewdskeletor13 its a pretty sick action rpg style now but special moves still make use of a limit break meter its pretty rad lookin check out the youtube video
[1:55:03] <Djinnazz> gotta Neg her first.
[1:55:05] <%Edgy_Macaroon> she is the fight
[1:55:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> She's a random encounter.
[1:55:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> fight her, and answer all the shit right
[1:55:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @rytisone It's not.
[1:55:15] <majindusto> Cait Sith is ACTUALLY the worst
[1:55:16] <shiny_prinny> can he get yuffie this early?
[1:55:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> also
[1:55:17] <%Ranryu692> Seriously? That's how you get Yuffie? Jeez
[1:55:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> DON'T SAVE
[1:55:22] <@lewdskeletor13> @colonelrozum I probably will check it out after stream
[1:55:22] <%supersugoisenpai1> Took me like 20 min to get her last time
[1:55:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> when you find her
[1:55:24] <InugamiTheHound> you have to fight her and the get her
[1:55:24] <miendrh93> Wait who said you can't jump in the remake?
[1:55:25] <Sokumotanaka> @AngriestPat What are you gonna name naruto there?
[1:55:32] <%king_strongstyle> U gotta answer her questions right too
[1:55:32] <SpoonFighter> what did you use your mp on
[1:55:36] <%kknutson4> kknutson4 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Yay 6 months with this boy. Can't wait for him to do FF8 next :D
[1:55:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The encounter rates for Yuffie go up as you progress through the game but it's possible to get her as soon as you finish the mine.
[1:55:39] <+0oki> Caith Sith is the real villain
[1:55:41] <SleepyMaribo> i never liked the fact that Yuffie is locked behind a random encounter
[1:55:45] <Louie_Salmon> @artoflec I dunno, I get the feeling combat will be more slow and Cloud won't get any way of moving fast in combat.
[1:55:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I hate it. Call her BASEBALL
[1:55:50] <%Kataguro> Name Cait Sith Benchwarmer
[1:55:51] <+Draylle> ah good ol' Nalt
[1:55:53] <CrypticMochi> Go with BUTTZ2NUTZ
[1:55:53] <%Keyd00d> Weird I got her first encounter
[1:55:54] <+Intolerable> BELIEVE IT!
[1:55:55] <%supersugoisenpai1> I remember the answers
[1:55:56] <%Gogogolem> don't worry we'll help you.
[1:55:57] <Heyestus> Yuffie's more of a Boruto
[1:55:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> RNG a bitch
[1:55:59] <DirgeNovak> Name Cait Sith Cat Shit
[1:56:00] <hippieofdeath> NALT
[1:56:01] <%ColonelRozum> @lewdskeletor13 they did a fantastic job imo and im not a huge ff fan either 7 is the only named one i like
[1:56:02] <Sokumotanaka> What!?
[1:56:02] <misterspotswood> BASEBALL YES
[1:56:05] <%Tennochief> Call her, Weeb Trash
[1:56:07] <%Xooler67> how about the name PatsBrother
[1:56:14] <%ElenaManetta> Ah, so she's a wild legendary pokemon
[1:56:17] <%AncelDeLambert> call her Naruto
[1:56:22] <%FloppytoKey> the percentage is higher the further you get into the game
[1:56:22] <@StridentSong> Just remember not to do ANYTHING that draws your attention away from Yuffie. Don't open your menu, don't save, etc.
[1:56:22] <%Owkono> the encounter rate goes up at later forests
[1:56:23] <Sokumotanaka> How would this work in the remake?
[1:56:25] <+buffn99> You can get her later much easier though
[1:56:25] <%Ranryu692> Name someone "Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry Series"
[1:56:30] <Louie_Salmon> Wait a character in a random encounter? That's insane
[1:56:31] <+without_borders> @AngriestPat She shows up at the temple of the ancients if you dont encounter her
[1:56:31] <Darkfire346> call her Jailbait
[1:56:32] <%Kataguro> Knights will still take like a minute
[1:56:33] <mr_slaide> Look at that asshole!
[1:56:34] <Desertfishing> i wonder how summons will look in remake
[1:56:34] <SleepyMaribo> lol pat KOTR at max speed is so dumb
[1:56:34] <mr_slaide> STEAL
[1:56:36] <%starotter70> @Sokumotanaka Probably won'd be optional
[1:56:37] <mankeyfigh> Real time combat with ATB
[1:56:37] <+Draylle> it looks so smooth
[1:56:38] <buffmiku> FUN
[1:56:41] <%StripesUltimateEdition> REDBULL DOWN
[1:56:41] <$shurtal> if i remember right, she's more common in the gongaga forrest than she is on this continent
[1:56:42] <Ner234> DED
[1:56:43] <+Grayhammatter> redbull is dead!
[1:56:44] <Aydarkzero> no speed up allowed during Knights though!
[1:56:44] <@StridentSong> Pat's Redbull fell over
[1:56:45] <krymzen5> yes...yes it is
[1:56:47] <%supersugoisenpai1> She's so evasive, like a ninja or something
[1:56:49] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat try the next forest over
[1:56:50] <majindusto> Try Other Forrests too
[1:56:50] <shiny_prinny> almost wiped there
[1:56:50] <$jobbedbone> SPONSORSHIP OVER
[1:56:51] <%RupanSen> Monster > Redbull
[1:56:51] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat call yuffie area 51 Naruto runner
[1:56:53] <@lewdskeletor13> Wasn’t Yuffie in Kingdom Hearts?
[1:56:54] <%Owkono> deadbull
[1:56:55] <Dementedpenguin> I remember encountering her near the end of the game. >_>
[1:56:57] <Heyestus> Knights of the round still takes a full 30s with the speedup SeemsGood
[1:56:59] <reinbachthe3rd> #narutorun
[1:57:00] <Sokumotanaka> @starotter70 But would you still find her here?
[1:57:02] <hippieofdeath> Yeah backdowns!!!
[1:57:03] <rytisone> yeyeye Fort Condor
[1:57:05] <mr_slaide> Best part of the game!!!!
[1:57:06] <@StridentSong> She can show up in any forest
[1:57:07] <Dementedpenguin> That was my random encounter
[1:57:12] <%Keyd00d> No boat Yuffie :(
[1:57:12] <wookie5358> "Our dog's dead". "Cool story bro come fight for us"
[1:57:13] <@StridentSong> Except Bone Vallet
[1:57:16] <%Ranryu692> @lewdskeletor13 yes, in Traverse Town with Squall and Aerith
[1:57:17] <@StridentSong> Valley^
[1:57:17] <%supersugoisenpai1> @lewdskeletor13 She was, the second one
[1:57:21] <Sokumotanaka> @reinbachthe3rd Can't naruto hide
[1:57:22] <Darkfire346> Knights of the Round: when Overkill isnt good enough
[1:57:25] <GizmoKSX> Looking up recruiting Yuffie; is it too early now?
[1:57:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @lewdskeletor13 alt universe shit. that's why squall isn't named squall in KH
[1:57:33] <wookie5358> You can get her now
[1:57:37] <%FloppytoKey> fort condor people are con artists
[1:57:38] <mr_slaide> Yeyeyeyeyeyeyeye
[1:57:41] <Sokumotanaka> You should be able to get her cause I did
[1:57:44] <@StridentSong> There is no too early. She can show up in any forest area
[1:57:46] <Sokumotanaka> I always do
[1:57:50] <GizmoKSX> A'ight.
[1:57:51] <shiny_prinny> *uses place to rest and leaves
[1:57:55] <%FloppytoKey> they left me without any money in my first playthrough
[1:57:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> She shows up in any forest area yes.
[1:57:56] <+HyperCharge_Sam> fort condor legit sucks
[1:57:56] <%starotter70> @Sokumotanaka Can't say but yeah, that'll be pretty interesting to see
[1:57:56] <+tuesti> you can get yuffie immediately
[1:57:58] <%AncelDeLambert> BOOOOO
[1:58:01] <%starotter70> Good
[1:58:01] <%Kataguro> Yeah, almost certainly
[1:58:02] <+tuesti> nooooooo
[1:58:02] <%Owkono> yay
[1:58:03] <Djinnazz> Why?
[1:58:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yup
[1:58:05] <HeadsHeldHigh> :(
[1:58:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> definitely
[1:58:06] <SleepyMaribo> you really think they will cut this part?
[1:58:06] <%Wrashis> so i never played kh3 but i gotta ask, anyone who played kh3, is there a 1 ff character in kh3?
[1:58:07] <%Scottigecko> that or it will be more intricate than ever
[1:58:07] <wookie5358> Phoenix still has to exist, along with the huge materia
[1:58:07] <%AncelDeLambert> Gimme stupid minigames!
[1:58:08] <rhus> No one will miss it
[1:58:11] <Aydarkzero> the battle thing?
[1:58:11] <+asgard147> I hope they do this better or it cut in the remake
[1:58:12] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Doesn't this shit take forever?
[1:58:13] <shinigami40297> it better not be
[1:58:14] <majindusto> Its NOT too early...Yuffie can just show up in any Forrest
[1:58:15] <%Owkono> change at least
[1:58:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Fort Condor would be a pain in the ass to stream it.
[1:58:16] <TimetodiveLTX> DLC
[1:58:21] <shinigami40297> the minigame was fun
[1:58:21] <wookie5358> This will come out when the PS5 is a thing, so they may be able to make it fancy
[1:58:22] <misterspotswood> plz dont take me out of the game
[1:58:25] <chronoxgp> tower defense
[1:58:25] <%FloppytoKey> there exactly ZERO FF characters in KH3
[1:58:26] <+HyperCharge_Sam> the units move like 1cm a minute it's such a drag
[1:58:26] <SleepyMaribo> @Wrashis there are no FF characters in KH3
[1:58:29] <%Gogogolem> WHy isn't this old man freaked out by that talking dog.
[1:58:29] <%ElenaManetta> LOL
[1:58:30] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> watch it be a mini game in the casino
[1:58:34] <Louie_Salmon> Wait, is this the weird ass tower defense thing?
[1:58:36] <%enickma11> If they change one thing I just hope they make the damn thing shorter
[1:58:37] <Sokumotanaka> @starotter70 Cause I was thinking if she was a battle, wouldn't you see her in the forest?
[1:58:37] <GizmoKSX> The Shinra. The Facebook. The Brian Kendrick.
[1:58:44] <%Kataguro> The Baby

[1:58:56] <wookie5358> This part can be cheesed in multiple ways to make it really short and easy
[1:58:59] <%starotter70> @Sokumotanaka That makes sense
[1:59:00] <Djinnazz> @AngriestPat They're not cutting this, it'll be changed, too many ppl like it.
[1:59:01] <poweruser> The Condor
[1:59:01] <reinbachthe3rd> I hope they don't cut this.
[1:59:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh, is this the weird sorta RTS but not really part
[1:59:07] <Sokumotanaka> This can't be cut it's how you get the pheonix materia
[1:59:10] <%ElenaManetta> "Are you interested?" "NO" "Well, let me just show you real quick". I know so many people like this.
[1:59:11] <%Kataguro> If Barrett were here, he'd protect the planet
[1:59:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Make yourself a Condor Omlet
[1:59:16] <%Teintstein> which came first, the reactor or the egg

[1:59:45] <wookie5358> They won't sell unless you agrree to figght
[1:59:47] <artoflec> there are a lot of just trash minigame filler crap that i dont think they'll bother putting into the remake
[1:59:47] <jellssssss20> Why not help?
[1:59:47] <wookie5358> stingy bastards.
[1:59:54] <%starotter70> Tifa Affection go apatBig down
[1:59:56] <%AncelDeLambert> @jellssssss20 you have to agree to help them first

[2:00:10] <%Owkono> you gotta help them
[2:00:11] <wookie5358> You have to agree to the battle, then you can just ignore them
[2:00:12] <%ShichiNoBushi> This is on Switch.
[2:00:12] <%Dingus_Tickler> @sphincter_spelunker FBRun atpBird FBBlock
[2:00:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @artoflec They're going to have MORE trash filler in the remake. It's gonna be multiple games after all.

[2:00:46] <%Owkono> rocks and men
[2:00:46] <Desertfishing> didnt know they had a switch emulator out Kappa
[2:00:48] <%ElenaManetta> These 2D backgrounds are so neat
[2:00:48] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Do you remember the basics of CQC?"
[2:00:49] <+asgard147> You mean just hiring mercs? limesThink
[2:00:52] <%Kataguro> Sleep, Deadbull
[2:00:53] <%ElenaManetta> The level of 3D model interaction with them
[2:01:00] <shiny_prinny> i mean, if they cut nothing this might be a 4 part release
[2:01:02] <Hazard_Kujacker> Military Tactics? Of the Final Fantasy Variety?
[2:01:14] <%Dingus_Tickler> @angriestpat They better keep the part where you climb a mountain and have to maintain body temperature. atpRtsd
[2:01:18] <InugamiTheHound> @asgard147 super cute sticker icon
[2:01:21] <%RupanSen> eh, PC mods clean it up better
[2:01:24] <jellssssss20> ANY MINUTE NOW THEY’LL BE-zzzzzzzz oh they’re asleep

[2:01:35] <majindusto> Time to get Yuffie
[2:01:43] <rhus> I wish they cleaned up the FFIX port a bit better. Font sucks and the backgrounds are super crusty.
[2:01:43] <InugamiTheHound> but what about new summon at the top of fort Condor?
[2:01:49] <artoflec> @Too_Much_Nukie artofl1Sad

[2:02:22] <King_thunder365> Anyone else ever notice Yuffire's Francis York Morgan-like shark teeth in her portrait?
[2:02:23] <%Kataguro> BEST
[2:02:23] <Sokumotanaka> STEAL FROM THEM BTW
[2:02:24] <shiny_prinny> @buffn99 i hope so, but a full game being midgar makes me think it could be longer
[2:02:26] <+tuesti> can you take out cloud in this port or nah is that a mod only thing? would have been so good for leveling everyone

[2:22:04] <%starotter70> Yes

[2:22:05] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat stealing is based on character level and nothing else, my man

[2:22:27] <Sokumotanaka> @AngriestPat Tbf you told us to yell at you at every thief opportunity
[2:22:29] <dailylifewithry> I actually like FF13. But boy it could have been better. Also the sequels are atrocious
[2:22:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> her name is Naruto.
[2:22:32] <GypsySquid> Used to have a similar problem with Tifa, pronouncing it like Tiffany.
[2:22:32] <%Owkono> fixed
[2:22:33] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> "Fixed"?
[2:22:36] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You need Baseball to warm the bench for you
[2:22:37] <chronoxgp> ff4 is like 30 hours, ff6 is liike 36 hours
[2:22:43] <Luesagna00> wow...Tifa's knockers are BLATANT in this o.o
[2:22:44] <%ShichiNoBushi> Pat was fixed. So he can't get Paige pregnant, confirmed.
[2:22:45] <%king_wragles> @GarbageNirvana gross
[2:22:49] <kingbaconcrispy> Oh no, your weird pronounciation before you're fixed by voice acting. I know that one
[2:22:51] <%Ilpala> FF13 is pretty fun once the battle system opens up, it should just do so before 15 hours in

[2:23:39] <miendrh93> @king_wragles I sometimes wonder how many people loaded Aerith up as their primary mage and were devastated the first time they hit the end of disc 1
[2:23:40] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @Theophilus567 that was last night bruv
[2:23:45] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat I've been gone most of the stream, what're we grinding for?

[2:23:48] <Valdorick> Yuffie Name - Benchwarmer
[2:23:49] <%Tennochief> @lewdskeletor13 he did the KFC China rad
[2:23:50] <+Grayhammatter> benchwarmer yuffie
[2:23:53] <Sokumotanaka> @AngriestPat Might as well get the weapon cause you have the non optional break free from shinra force battle laters
[2:23:54] <dailylifewithry> I like the battle system in FF13 a lot, I just wanted more side quests, some breathing room, exploration.
[2:23:57] <%Tennochief> raid
[2:23:57] <SomersaultJustice> but you never used it cause the animations take forever
[2:23:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> someone's gotta keep the bench warm
[2:24:03] <majindusto> Poor Yuffie BibleThump
[2:24:04] <%king_wragles> @miendrh93 dude, me and my brothers used her as our ONLY healer
[2:24:05] <dailylifewithry> Why hate Yuffie tho?
[2:24:09] <%Owkono> Knights plus mp absorb is good
[2:24:12] <%daemonazaezal> @king_wragles hes trying to get yuffie i think
[2:24:13] <Valdorick> Yuffie's name - Transformbitch
[2:24:15] <%Keyd00d> apparently this forest has a 32/256 chance of her appearing
[2:24:17] <%Theophilus567> @terminallycapriciousz Really? I got a notification saying he was playing outer wilds around 8 today.
[2:24:22] <+Scevda> Dont know how much she can warm it in her booty shorta.
[2:24:33] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @Theophilus567 might have been a mistake, he was definitely playing it last night
[2:24:38] <$arcielardor> what's your favorite magic system in any game?
[2:24:39] <chronoxgp> that is 1/8
[2:24:45] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I was a bench warmer in high school. Even though I was just as good as the starters FeelBadMan
[2:24:46] <Sokumotanaka> Ff15 's summon magic is so bs cause what's his face would throw the staff underground to save your ass
[2:24:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> naruto is only in this game because ninjas.
[2:24:49] <rytisone> Grind Ass4Dayz to unlock her ultimate limit break Kappa
[2:24:50] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> FeelsBadMan *
[2:24:59] <%daemonazaezal> notificatiuons are bad for pat cause he doesnt shut off the last game, happened the other day with ff7
[2:25:04] <%Owkono> i use them to grind LB levels early game
[2:25:08] <chronoxgp> i had a 405 squat and played one game lol
[2:25:19] <%daemonazaezal> gotta give him set up time
[2:25:19] <%ElenaManetta> So what option is Pat supposed to pick to get Yuffie, chat chased her off!
[2:25:20] <%starotter70> She doesn't disappear if you answer incorrectly, does she?
[2:25:21] <%Keyd00d> 2nd best girl
[2:25:28] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat did you know the ffx remastered they reduced Lulu's honkers?
[2:25:28] <majindusto> You are Bad Pat
[2:25:30] <%Ilpala> changing the game name on twitch
[2:25:32] <%daemonazaezal> mmy phone said you where streaming ff7
[2:25:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Why do you not like Yuhffie? Does she bore you?
[2:25:33] <Valdorick> Ah yes, what I say when I get Quina in FF9
[2:25:36] <%Scorpion12590> Scorpion12590 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months!

[2:25:45] <jellssssss20> Us thinking this was outer wilds at first
[2:25:46] <%Keyd00d> stumbo
[2:25:47] <%daemonazaezal> no big
[2:25:47] <%terminallyCapriciousz> It showed up as Outer Wilds earlier rather than FF7, allegedly @AngriestPat
[2:25:48] <+AlexGrahamBell> suchikedo?
[2:25:50] <%daemonazaezal> just fyi
[2:25:54] <amused_platypus> Cait sith or Yuffie Pat which will bench forever

[2:26:08] <%Wrashis> both
[2:26:09] <dailylifewithry> Awwww that’s too bad he doesn’t like Yuffie, she’s one of my faves
[2:26:10] <%ElenaManetta> You're not a TRUE FAN if you don't FOLLOW THE EVER-CHANGING TWITTER SCHEDULE anyway
[2:26:16] <%Wrashis> pat will be using this team
[2:26:16] <%vectorless_peon> @AngriestPat i feel like shes in the circular forest more often the one between the condor reacter and the cannon town
[2:26:21] <%MassConnect> as I recall, if you date Yuffie she actually kisses you. Aerith and Tifa do not give Cloud jack. Ever.
[2:26:22] <Valdorick> @rumtumtugnutz Literally the worst, everything about them I hate.
[2:26:23] <%Wrashis> this is THE team
[2:26:24] <%Anonymasque> Pat made a human error?! Oh no!
[2:26:25] <TranquilTurnip> What role does Cait Sith play for a team?
[2:26:30] <majindusto> CAIT SITH IS ACTUALLY THE WORST PAT
[2:26:33] <misterspotswood> i remember reading a h-doujin where yuffie gets attacked in the bathroom at costa del sol by a tentical monster, then after the nasty cloud rushes in and saves her
[2:26:39] <%Keyd00d> @MassConnect yeah but tifa fucks you at the end of the game tho
[2:26:42] <@lewdskeletor13> @elenamanetta There’s also a schedule in the Discord but you wouldn’t know cause you won’t join loser
[2:26:43] <SomersaultJustice> Tifa gives cloud quite a bit (allegedly)
[2:26:43] <%Owkono> its not like you told us yesterday you were gonna stream ff7 or anything
[2:26:44] <Doc1790> HE GOT NOTHIN
[2:26:51] <%Broand> What's he stealin?
[2:26:51] <Sokumotanaka> So in remake do you any of you think they'll bring up that female nanaki to explain his kids?
[2:26:51] <%wsintai> @TranquilTurnip Good question! The answer is nothing
[2:26:52] <+AlexGrahamBell> you gotta use woolie to steal
[2:26:52] <Ner234> Steal ResidentSleeper
[2:27:03] <%ElenaManetta> Discord is for losers and also discord won't let me log in because it will never send me an email verification
[2:27:05] <+Grayhammatter> No
[2:27:08] <Sokumotanaka> @Broand A yuffie weapon
[2:27:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Wow, it's just like you're playing FF9
[2:27:11] <+tuesti> no, tifa and cloud had vigorous and passionate cuddling all night long
[2:27:13] <TheMorilo> LUL
[2:27:13] <TranquilTurnip> @wsintai hahaha I can't even deny that because I've played the game and still have no idea
[2:27:14] <%Theophilus567> @lewdskeletor13 How do I get in on that discord?
[2:27:15] <%cureneckbeard> it would be a good joke to name every character Pat
[2:27:22] <%Broand> is that like ultima weapon
[2:27:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> @valdorick I had a soft spot for the blonde chick. whatsername.
[2:27:33] <%supersugoisenpai1> Steal rates are so bad
[2:27:33] <InugamiTheHound> Chewie could steal it easily because he's "urban"
[2:27:36] <majindusto> YOU'RE STATS ARE SHIT BRO
[2:27:51] <%Anonymasque> But I love Discord smokeTEARS
[2:27:52] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat If you are not going use Yuffie in your party, why even try and get her? Unless she has unique interesting dialogue?
[2:27:55] <@lewdskeletor13> @theophilus567 Connect your Twitch account to your discord account, and you should be given an option to join
[2:27:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Alternitavely, you could name Yuffie Shortstop
[2:27:58] <%Keyd00d> YEAH
[2:27:59] <%Tennochief> isn't yuffie good at stealing?

[2:31:19] <Pallion_> no confusion status in this one?
[2:31:21] <Valdorick> Man, Boruto's dad seems really strong, does the anime ever show him fight? Also, he seems to have some kinda history with Sarada's Dad; they should go into more detail into that, maybe make a prequal anime.
[2:31:23] <%MassConnect> feed him the spicy wrap
[2:31:26] <%king_wragles> @StridentSong Can't you also use reflect, or am I thinking a different FF?
[2:31:34] <Louie_Salmon> Wait, I thought last stream you said enemy materias were useless?
[2:31:35] <+Grayhammatter> gross
[2:31:36] <%king_wragles> Like cast it on the monster
[2:31:42] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Good stuff
[2:31:43] <%starotter70> Ye
[2:31:45] <Aydarkzero> s;lright
[2:31:46] <%Stevennapalm> so this is the first time watching ff7 and wow tifa has chest beefers
[2:31:46] <Ion_Laser> it's good

[2:31:47] <+ryosuke91kc> FF7 stream is good stream
[2:31:47] <%XzileGaming> always

[2:31:49] <%Kataguro> Yeah, FF7 is a comfy goodstream
[2:31:50] <rytisone> It's ok
[2:31:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ye
[2:31:52] <+FattimusSlime> It's no FF9
[2:31:52] <Ner234> It's aight
[2:31:55] <Sokumotanaka> @Pallion_ Even with confuse all it does are attacks
[2:31:58] <wookie5358> fun times
[2:31:59] <%blastazoid26> White wind is like the only good enemy skill
[2:31:59] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm surprised how well it's held up honestly
[2:31:59] <%Owkono> you dont get the materia for reflect any time soon
[2:32:02] <12gagerager> Good strem
[2:32:03] <%Wrashis> i might even be having 2 funs
[2:32:05] <%Theophilus567> I just got on. Did pat get Beta or is he a coward?
[2:32:05] <Sokumotanaka> MEh ff6 & 9 better :P
[2:32:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's pretty streamy
[2:32:08] <%Tennochief> EAT HIM
[2:32:09] <@StridentSong> @king_wragles I've never used reflect to get it. It might be possible. But he'd need a Star Curtain to have reflect at this point
[2:32:11] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> I just popped at "I'M BORT", already loving stream LUL
[2:32:15] <%ElenaManetta> Pat reaches for Elmo off-screen and a gush of flood sprays on camera
[2:32:19] <%king_wragles> @StridentSong ah
[2:32:23] <majindusto> Not As good as FFVI
[2:32:33] <+Stereotreme> anyone else dropping frames like crazy?

[2:32:38] <%Tennochief> no
[2:32:41] <%This_is_Marco> Sure hope we can suplex the weapons in the remake.
[2:32:41] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Valdorick I was reading Bort and in the comment section, there was even staff members of the site getting annoyed with where the story might be going regarding Naruto LUL
[2:32:50] <%Kataguro> Dropping Ass

[2:32:52] <%AbnormalVoid> Pat was summoning Meteor
[2:32:52] <majindusto> No?
[2:32:52] <jellssssss20> It’s really hard to get into ff10-2, does it have good points/reasons to play? I keep bouncing off it

[2:33:04] <Jflaskd13> Is pat playing og version or new threat like max?
[2:33:05] <weewii> dis game pretty gret, thanks for playing it for me
[2:33:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> FF9 became ridiculously easy once you started abusing reflect
[2:33:09] <%king_wragles> no ONE GUY should have all that power
[2:33:14] <shiny_prinny> twitch needs a one guy emote
[2:33:16] <+Stereotreme> I think you're good, Pat
[2:33:18] <Ion_Laser> @Jflaskd13 og on Switch
[2:33:24] <Jflaskd13> awesome
[2:33:27] <+Stereotreme> likely just Twitch being Twitch
[2:33:30] <Valdorick> @Sphincter_Spelunker I can't believe the Vase building arc is over with. It was so integral to the story.
[2:33:42] <%Keyd00d> ?

[2:34:01] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Pretty bird.
[2:34:08] <Jflaskd13> @AngriestPat you know about the battle exploit where you bum rush the units so the battle ends o an empty feild early?
[2:34:09] <%kujofire990> Birb Squad
[2:34:09] <Guardiansaiyan> LOVE the .jpeg picture of the sky
[2:34:11] <Sokumotanaka> When's pat getting the secret optional character "Lucky ted?"
[2:34:11] <ammobasket> BIG egg

[2:34:27] <TranquilTurnip> I love this weird tower defense segment, its so out of nowhere
[2:34:28] <%Chocolatevgz> Thanks for the fuckin' math lesson, bud
[2:34:28] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> How could we ever fill in that hole? All the water will escape! @Valdorick
[2:34:29] <+0oki> do you know the cheese ways?
[2:34:30] <%radda343> "Our strategy is that you do the strategy"
[2:34:31] <%Kataguro> Hire Guts
[2:34:31] <%ElenaManetta> O
[2:34:34] <dama2046> Man, I did all the condor battles last time I played FF7. They really suck
[2:34:35] <%Keyd00d> do everything for us
[2:34:37] <%Tennochief> This game has an amazing contrast between the the art and actual gameplay
[2:34:38] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat you know the trick to this, right?
[2:34:41] <%Theophilus567> @king_wragles Nah not yet.
[2:34:43] <Guardiansaiyan> Give the place some BIT DROPS
[2:34:47] <majindusto> I love that FFVII is on a Nintendo System Now
[2:34:50] <Valdorick> @Sphincter_Spelunker Guess we'll just have to use glue.
[2:34:51] <rytisone> Peace, I'm out
[2:34:54] <%GarbageQueenEllie> With all the handholding these guys need you to do, you should technically own them by the end
[2:34:55] <@StridentSong> Alright
[2:34:56] <Jflaskd13> @AngriestPat you know about the battle exploit where you bum rush the units so the battle ends o an empty feild earl
[2:34:57] <%XzileGaming> git gud
[2:34:57] <TranquilTurnip> to win 4Head
[2:34:57] <rytisone> says Clumbo
[2:34:59] <%supersugoisenpai1> You get money back for everyone who lives btw
[2:35:01] <%MassConnect> whatcha mean?
[2:35:04] <InugamiTheHound> let them come up and you fight and kill them all
[2:35:06] <%king_wragles> @Theophilus567 okay, thanks man
[2:35:06] <$shurtal> Rush tot he bottom, have no enemies on screen
[2:35:08] <%AbnormalVoid> @AngriestPat rush it with fast units, add specialized units for the types of enemies after
[2:35:09] <misterspotswood> money
[2:35:10] <Guardiansaiyan> HIT that like and Subcribe button in that fortress
[2:35:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> several
[2:35:11] <%MassConnect> you ahve to back track A LOT to get all the rewards
[2:35:13] <majindusto> WIN
[2:35:16] <%RupanSen> rush the bottom
[2:35:16] <+Intolerable> MONEY
[2:35:17] <ammobasket> Fight them all?
[2:35:18] <%Owkono> rock paper scisors combat
[2:35:18] <@StridentSong> I'll send it to you
[2:35:18] <Koosahmii> Seven Samurai reference here?
[2:35:20] <%Edgy_Macaroon> overwhelm
[2:35:24] <TioXyco> money is the trick
[2:35:24] <mankeyfigh> Put troops as FAR UP AS POSSIBLE
[2:35:24] <Jflaskd13> noenemies on screen = auto victory
[2:35:24] <TimetodiveLTX> Just Win
[2:35:24] <%Ascethetic> slow the game and rush bottom
[2:35:25] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat you put one unit in the center of the screen as low as you can, then start the game. Put it in the slowest mode, then keep adding units as low as possible
[2:35:27] <shiny_prinny> kill all enemies on screen and the fight ends before more units come in
[2:35:30] <Luesagna00> looooots of potions?
[2:35:30] <Sokumotanaka> I just put op units in their way
[2:35:31] <Bladeexe> Just have enough money to buy good enough troops to fight the enemies.
[2:35:32] <jellssssss20> Strident to the rescue?
[2:35:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> if you're strong enough, you can just cheese it and let them get to you, leaving just the boss fight
[2:35:34] <Wan6Saber> holy shit, the ingame like picture art. PAt you fucker athClap
[2:35:36] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat listen to Strident
[2:35:37] <wookie5358> There's no loss to letting them come up and fighitng a simple battle, otherwise you daisychain allies down to the bottom and as long as there's nothing left on the screen you automatically win
[2:35:37] <%Keyd00d> kill them all pat
[2:35:40] <+ryosuke91kc> @AngriestPat when you do the fight the trick is to make one unit at the most forward end then have him rush. as enemies spaw,n, make the counter to that enemy unit then rush n kill em
[2:35:44] <+0oki> spawn units downward to cover more ground and meet them at the bottom
[2:35:45] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat the game ends when there are no enemies on the screen, so you can rush the bottom and kill the first units that spawn, ending the game
[2:35:47] <%Theophilus567> @king_wragles He probably won’t even make it to cosmo till the end of next stream. AT THE EARLIEST.
[2:35:52] <%king_wragles> kk
[2:35:54] <%RupanSen> Max clears it in like 2 minutes rushing the bottom
[2:35:57] <+gamesasacervix> you only have to kill what's on screen, so kill them as soon as they spawn
[2:36:06] <%terminallyCapriciousz> kill them all
[2:36:08] <Jflaskd13> spawn camp @AngriestPat
[2:36:09] <Jolnir> tell them to fuck off
[2:36:11] <Valdorick> You can bum rush cheat, you can play the RTS, or you can just let an enemy reach the top, and beat a boss (but lose forever if you lose, so save scum like a scum who saves)
[2:36:19] <mankeyfigh> RUSHHHH EMMMMM
[2:36:20] <%ElenaManetta> We don't need 20 soldiers, I can do it all by myself.
[2:36:24] <%AncelDeLambert> yep
[2:36:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Bomb them with Tifa's giant ass
[2:36:29] <Jflaskd13> valdorick is right
[2:36:42] <%Ascethetic> @AngriestPat make sure you low it to its max
[2:36:44] <ミュウレ4242> the so called zerg rush.
[2:36:45] <%Ascethetic> slow*
[2:36:49] <shiny_prinny> put battle speed to slow too
[2:36:58] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat remember that the game has to have STARTED to be able to put units lower
[2:37:02] <%Owkono> skip
[2:37:13] <%Edgy_Macaroon> it's easy don't think to hard
[2:37:18] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> SourPls
[2:37:28] <@commanderclaw> Isn't there an exploit for this section?
[2:37:28] <majindusto> Its actually Super Easy
[2:37:30] <%AncelDeLambert> cheapest unit
[2:37:31] <%Kataguro> Polygons
[2:37:31] <%Keyd00d> POLYGON TEAM
[2:37:32] <%MassConnect> this absolute unit
[2:37:38] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat whatever's cheapest
[2:37:39] <wookie5358> After placing one, start it then keep placing them lower
[2:37:40] <%Keyd00d> STONER
[2:37:41] <dickbuttwoman> Stoner
[2:37:41] <Valdorick> Blazeit
[2:37:43] <ape_hawk> STONER ARMY
[2:37:43] <dickbuttwoman> 420 blazit
[2:37:46] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Stoner" heheh.
[2:37:46] <SpoonFighter> aged like fine wine
[2:37:47] <rhus> s t o n e r
[2:37:47] <%AbnormalVoid> SourPls
[2:37:49] <%daemonazaezal> back in the day this was mind blowing
[2:37:50] <%Estuko> tbh, I thought the fighting polygon team were the coolest.
[2:37:59] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat now start the round
[2:38:00] <%MassConnect> still a better minigame than blitzball
[2:38:02] <misterspotswood> FF7RTS
[2:38:03] <ミュウレ4242> this had better be like majima construction beautiful and complete in the remake.
[2:38:04] <shiny_prinny> start it then place them
[2:38:05] <Valdorick> Go, and play Ogre Battle!
[2:38:12] <wookie5358> The line goes down once you start the game then you can place more
[2:38:13] <%ShichiNoBushi> Versus... Fighting Polygon Team!
[2:38:13] <%Theophilus567> I think attacker’s are the fastest unit.
[2:38:14] <shiny_prinny> yes
[2:38:14] <%RupanSen> yup
[2:38:15] <%Ascethetic> yes
[2:38:17] <@StridentSong> Yea
[2:38:17] <%AncelDeLambert> go go go
[2:38:21] <+ryosuke91kc> yes start now then send your one dude to attack
[2:38:22] <%Keyd00d> y
[2:38:26] <+Tokanova> egg
[2:38:29] <majindusto> YE
[2:38:29] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat remember you can lower the game speed once you start
[2:38:32] <mankeyfigh> YES
[2:38:32] <+ryosuke91kc> the farther down he goes the farther down u can spawn units
[2:38:36] <%AbnormalVoid> you can add more
[2:38:37] <%AncelDeLambert> yeyeyeyeye
[2:38:44] <@StridentSong> POlace more
[2:38:45] <%AncelDeLambert> ADD UNITS
[2:38:48] <%XzileGaming> should just play it for real rather than this strat
[2:38:49] <%Keyd00d> ADD
[2:38:49] <%ElenaManetta> Is this tower defense?
[2:38:50] <@StridentSong> Place more
[2:38:55] <shiny_prinny> place more in a chain
[2:38:55] <%AbnormalVoid> add more
[2:38:56] <wookie5358> place more in front of the attacker
[2:38:56] <+Stereotreme> place more as he gets lower
[2:39:00] <Jolnir> place more units
[2:39:03] <@StridentSong> Each time you add a unit, you can add one lower
[2:39:06] <GypsySquid> It's basically tower defense.
[2:39:07] <%AncelDeLambert> As low as possible
[2:39:08] <mankeyfigh> PLACE MOREEE
[2:39:09] <@StridentSong> There ya go
[2:39:09] <+ryosuke91kc> the farther down he goes the farther down u can spawn units. so just send him all the way down
[2:39:11] <%supersugoisenpai1> The red line is where they can be place
[2:39:11] <%RupanSen> you get refunded for the surviving units so you can spam them
[2:39:11] <+0oki> as far down as you can
[2:39:12] <%Keyd00d> it sure is
[2:39:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[2:39:14] <Jolnir> yes it is
[2:39:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It sure is Pat.
[2:39:16] <Ion_Laser> :D
[2:39:17] <GypsySquid> Yep.
[2:39:18] <+Stereotreme> spread them out a bit though
[2:39:20] <+r_Foeburden87> thats y u only do it 1-2 times
[2:39:20] <%AncelDeLambert> wasted a ton of gil
[2:39:20] <+Grayhammatter> this looks dumb
[2:39:23] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Cheese it like Salsa con Queso
[2:39:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you can increase the speed
[2:39:24] <%ElenaManetta> So is this getting cut?
[2:39:26] <GypsySquid> Why are you buying so many?
[2:39:26] <%AbnormalVoid> now fight
[2:39:27] <@StridentSong> That's as low as the line goes. Now Move them to the bottom and kill the on-screen stuff
[2:39:28] <%starotter70> Look at all that gil
[2:39:28] <SpoonFighter> boy i didnt like this part at all
[2:39:29] <%Kataguro> Big Cheese
[2:39:29] <shiny_prinny> now attack
[2:39:30] <+ryosuke91kc> tell your dude to attack
[2:39:31] <%Edgy_Macaroon> just overwhelm
[2:39:34] <Sokumotanaka> wait how!?
[2:39:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and then increase it further with your switch x3 speed
[2:39:36] <rytisone> some thngs don't age well
[2:39:37] <+ryosuke91kc> you dont have to have them stand still, send them in
[2:39:38] <wookie5358> now if you kil everything on screen before more spawn it ends @AngriestPat
[2:39:40] <%supersugoisenpai1> rush and attack
[2:39:40] <%fallen92x> ATTACK
[2:39:41] <%Agami23> is this dota??
[2:39:43] <majindusto> ATTACK
[2:39:43] <%Gogogolem> Is this just spend money and win?
[2:39:44] <%Estuko> -ACTIVATING COMBAT MODE-
[2:39:44] <%Starlight_Gamer> yawn
[2:39:45] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat now tell them to attack
[2:39:45] <SomersaultJustice> you're basically watering your basketball right now
[2:39:45] <ammobasket> Add Attackers and defenders too!
[2:39:46] <%Keyd00d> attack please
[2:39:47] <+ryosuke91kc> it plays like starcraft, tell them to attack
[2:39:47] <%XzileGaming> cheesing this is boring to play
[2:39:50] <HeadsHeldHigh> send the bastards in
[2:39:54] <InugamiTheHound> hence why I let come to me and I wipe them all out
[2:39:55] <chief_wicks> speed it up
[2:39:59] <%Wrashis> conflict resolved
[2:40:01] <+RushUnplugged> remember when FF7 invented mobas? now you do
[2:40:03] <majindusto> THANK YOU
[2:40:08] <%Kataguro> It's so stupid and shitty
[2:40:14] <%Keyd00d> speed up
[2:40:16] <NeroInfinite> what is this nonsense
[2:40:18] <%Starlight_Gamer> ResidentSleeper
[2:40:19] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This is awesome
[2:40:21] <@StridentSong> You don't want them to attack, you want to command them to move to the bottom of the screen
[2:40:26] <%Tennochief> I'm confused
[2:40:33] <%supersugoisenpai1> You can just hit B, they'll auto attack
[2:40:39] <+TheSaintJohn> what even is this?
[2:40:44] <wookie5358> speedrun strats
[2:40:45] <@StridentSong> They'll attack the units as they encounter them moving
[2:40:52] <T3merity> Are these the fabled Blue Lions?
[2:40:53] <shiny_prinny> no don't
[2:40:57] <%fallen92x> don'
[2:41:00] <%AncelDeLambert> they spawn faster if you increase the game speed
[2:41:01] <%Tyonidus> umm
[2:41:02] <DarkOmen98> meta tower defense
[2:41:08] <%Tyonidus> what the heck is this brother
[2:41:10] <Neo_Kaiser> This minigame has 20 stages depending on your location in the story. To get all prizes you need to constantly go back and forth about every hour of progression.
[2:41:16] <shiny_prinny> they spawn faster and that ruins the trick if you increase speed
[2:41:22] <+Scevda> Lance is dissappointed @t3merity
[2:41:26] <@StridentSong> It doesn't ruin the trick
[2:41:27] <%Tyonidus> stoner atpSpiner atpButtHash atpButtHash
[2:41:33] <dama2046> And the reward isn't worth it
[2:41:34] <@StridentSong> The speed doesn't matter, he's not commanding them to move to the bottom
[2:41:39] <+Deathtronhammer> The mini-game that inspired the creation of Final Fantasy Tactics
[2:41:41] <%Tennochief> that sounds awful
[2:41:47] <%AncelDeLambert> MOST of the rewards aren't worth it. The third or fourth fight is
[2:41:52] <+Tokanova> real time final fantasy tactics!
[2:42:01] <cheezbass> @angriestpat speed has to be low for the trick to work
[2:42:14] <%Edgy_Macaroon> don't think too hard. you'll get through easy
[2:42:15] <@StridentSong> NO IT DOESNT
[2:42:15] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat do you want to hear about the STUPID times this minigame opens up?
[2:42:18] <+triple7sp> PAT PLAYS STARCRAFT?
[2:42:19] <%Keyd00d> no
[2:42:20] <Valdorick> ITs like you're battling some kinda ogres.
[2:42:21] <rytisone> how will this play in Remake?
[2:42:29] <mankeyfigh> HIGH
[2:42:30] <Neo_Kaiser> What's funny is that two of the rewards can't be gained. You can't go back to get them and have to force the story forawrd.
[2:42:30] <%Kataguro> I am sleep
[2:42:31] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat that's a big 3
[2:42:33] <jellssssss20> Move NOT attack
[2:42:33] <+RushUnplugged> make it an updated tower defense game, and it's gonna be awesome
[2:42:35] <Valdorick> It'll be a Gacha game in the remake.
[2:42:46] <asurite_warrior> reminds me of the early ass ogre star game
[2:42:46] <+ryosuke91kc> that bird needs arrownmen shooting at it
[2:43:03] <majindusto> ARROW THE BIRD
[2:43:06] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat would have an easier time here if he buys loot boxes.
[2:43:08] <Jflaskd13> you do need to kill them pat
[2:43:16] <Louie_Salmon> In the remake, this will play like autochess
[2:43:20] <shiny_prinny> you have to kill them or they just keep going
[2:43:39] <+Scevda> @louie_salmon exactly
[2:43:41] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat the next time you can play this is after you save the little girl. The time after THAT is after she gives you the whistle. The difference between these two opportunities is a few lines of dialogue.
[2:43:42] <Koosahmii> BIRD = ARROW
[2:43:44] <%Keyd00d> you...
[2:43:47] <%Keyd00d> did it
[2:43:48] <%Kataguro> WOW
[2:43:48] <%Edgy_Macaroon> Easy
[2:43:48] <%Tennochief> nevr do this again
[2:43:49] <+ryosuke91kc> damn hes so good at this
[2:43:50] <+Tokanova> now do it 4 more times
[2:43:50] <Jflaskd13> good job now you know the strat
[2:43:53] <@StridentSong> You don't have to command then to attack. They'll attack anything they walk intop
[2:43:53] <majindusto> LIKE A BOSS
[2:43:55] <wookie5358> Starcraft 2 grandmaster
[2:43:57] <GiygasDrillBreak> Remake should have PS1 graphics
[2:43:57] <mankeyfigh> YOU DID IT
[2:44:02] <%Kataguro> Useless for you
[2:44:08] <mankeyfigh> MAGIC COMB
[2:44:10] <%GarbageQueenEllie> cohm buh
[2:44:10] <%supersugoisenpai1> Redbull weapon
[2:44:10] <%Tennochief> LUL
[2:44:11] <%MassConnect> it's a red
[2:44:11] <%Wrashis> did he even net a profit
[2:44:13] <%ShichiNoBushi> Red weapon?
[2:44:13] <%Kataguro> Redbull
[2:44:13] <%starotter70> Red
[2:44:14] <%TheShal> In the remake this will be like Lords of Verminion
[2:44:15] <InugamiTheHound> red 13
[2:44:15] <%Owkono> redbull
[2:44:16] <@lewdskeletor13> You don’t have hair tho
[2:44:17] <majindusto> REDXIII
[2:44:18] <%supersugoisenpai1> Double growth
[2:44:18] <%starotter70> DOUBLE
[2:44:21] <%radda343> Double AP
[2:44:23] <%RupanSen> btw you can win earlier if you kill the first 2 enemies fast enough
[2:44:25] <@lewdskeletor13> What do you need a comb for
[2:44:34] <%king_wragles> @lewdskeletor13 his butt
[2:44:38] <%Owkono> level all for big money
[2:44:42] <%king_wragles> apatDab apatDab
[2:44:44] <shiny_prinny> red will comb his enemies to death
[2:44:45] <%IDTheftVictim> I suppose it makes sense Pat wouldn't know what a comb is apatWhat
[2:44:46] <GiygasDrillBreak> Remake pawns should be the FF7 cast, Fighter = Cloud
[2:44:50] <%starotter70> Ye
[2:44:50] <%AncelDeLambert> Red wears hair ornaments. A comb can be an ornament
[2:44:50] <%Kataguro> Gasp
[2:44:51] <amused_platypus> he needs it for his mane
[2:44:51] <Neo_Kaiser> What's funny is that Clouds triple growth weapon is less effective than his double growth weapon.
[2:44:55] <ammobasket> Makes this look good
[2:45:11] <%ShichiNoBushi> No point having Enemy Skill on it.
[2:45:17] <Jflaskd13> why is Tifa in the back and not 13 if anyone. Isn't she a godd DMG dealer?
[2:45:22] <Jflaskd13> oh
[2:45:24] <%fallen92x> enemy skill doesn't use AP
[2:45:26] <Jflaskd13> there we go
[2:45:27] <ミュウレ4242> time to comb the desert.
[2:45:30] <%AncelDeLambert> @Neo_Kaiser right? It's weird. Until endgame when all you want is to finish leveling KotR
[2:45:35] <majindusto> RED XIII...the Only good thin in Final Fantasy that is numbered "XIII"
[2:45:39] <InugamiTheHound> why have chococo lure on your equipment?
[2:45:40] <+Scevda> We aint found shit!
[2:45:44] <%RupanSen> @Jflaskd13 she had long range materia
[2:45:49] <%starotter70> @Jflaskd13 She had a materia that let her do equal damage from the back
[2:45:49] <%Edgy_Macaroon> until later
[2:45:49] <Jflaskd13> ooh
[2:45:52] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat The next opportunity is after saving the little girl in Junon
[2:45:53] <+Tokanova> For now
[2:45:53] <%Wrashis> you can do it again later for more dialogue but fuck that @AngriestPat
[2:46:01] <Jflaskd13> did he take that off then?
[2:46:07] <+Tokanova> Can't you get phoenix if you do it all the times
[2:46:09] <+Ryallen> I really hope the remake has a good amount of content in it
[2:46:09] <TimetodiveLTX> i want a one piece rpg
[2:46:10] <%starotter70> Put it on Red
[2:46:17] <TimetodiveLTX> it seems like such a gimmie
[2:46:17] <%GarbageQueenEllie> After you swap spit with that little girl, you'll need to come back
[2:46:24] <+Tokanova> ooo
[2:46:26] <+Ryallen> Otherwise there are going to be like 10 of the things, unless they start cutting a shit ton of stuff
[2:46:26] <%MassConnect> don't you have to donate though?
[2:46:34] <%MassConnect> if you're not coming back to fight yoruself
[2:46:37] <Silversunburst> hey is the ff6 mobile a good port?
[2:46:39] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat there's a dumb exploit that lets you get TWO phoenix materias
[2:46:39] <Neo_Kaiser> It's because Clouds triple growth weapon only has 3 slots while his double ap weapon has more. So overall you gain more ap.
[2:46:43] <Valdorick> Yeah, you gotta give them money at one point or you fuck it all up
[2:46:46] <%supersugoisenpai1> If they run out of funds and get overrun you can't
[2:46:46] <%RupanSen> @Jflaskd13 think he put it on Red
[2:46:49] <majindusto> NO
[2:46:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> Phoenix should be from the required one yeah
[2:46:51] <justafoxhere> You can literally just ignore this place until huge materia and treat it as a free rest stop before you get highwind
[2:46:53] <%starotter70> Run away from the fort
[2:46:58] <Jflaskd13> thx
[2:46:59] <%Keyd00d> do not play anything mobile
[2:46:59] <%starotter70> Hell nah
[2:46:59] <@commanderclaw> Get the GBA ROM
[2:47:00] <DirgeNovak> ff6 mobile has the garbo art stylr
[2:47:03] <$shurtal> if you win the mandetory Fort Condor mission, yes you get Pheonix. You CAN fail it
[2:47:08] <+OkamiDude15> @commanderclaw which one NotLikeThis
[2:47:10] <Silversunburst> is the gba port good?
[2:47:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> cool
[2:47:12] <Jflaskd13> he looks special
[2:47:13] <rhus> FF6 GBA patched is the best version
[2:47:15] <Silversunburst> what is the best ff6 port
[2:47:17] <%AbnormalVoid> I have never seen this enemy
[2:47:18] <%radda343> HELL RIDER
[2:47:19] <+r_Foeburden87> Art style is meh, but that same version is on steam so might as well get on steam
[2:47:21] <%Tearonex> I bought the Tactic mobile port, it's pretty good
[2:47:22] <%fallen92x> Patched GBA port
[2:47:22] <DirgeNovak> gba is the definitive edition of vi
[2:47:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> GBA port is great, yeah
[2:47:26] <wookie5358> You just miss out on a bunch of junk you can w-item dupe for not doing condor
[2:47:28] <%ShichiNoBushi> He just wants to get back to his Hell House.
[2:47:31] <shiny_prinny> wait so is that humanoid a mako monster or just some nutjob?
[2:47:36] <Louie_Salmon> Just emulate the gba port
[2:47:37] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat how good were these graphics back in the4 day?
[2:47:40] <+Scevda> Yes
[2:47:42] <rhus> You can patch the GBA version to restore the soundtrack and color
[2:47:42] <%moogleboy1984> the ROM of the GBA port with the SNES music patched is is best
[2:47:43] <misterspotswood> @shiny_prinny yes
[2:47:45] <%Keyd00d> amazing
[2:47:48] <%ColonelRozum> yes
[2:47:49] <%RupanSen> It's "best one", not great tho
[2:47:51] <+Tokanova> buh
[2:47:52] <%AncelDeLambert> revolutionary
[2:47:52] <+Tokanova> BRUH
[2:47:55] <%starotter70> People have always told me the SNES was the best version
[2:47:55] <+Tokanova> they were AMAZING
[2:47:55] <%zamzoph> lifelike
[2:47:57] <King_Wolf_Rigger> oh god, come on man
[2:47:58] <%Keyd00d> bruh moment
[2:47:59] <%Wrashis> they were basically the best ever
[2:48:00] <%SilvaChariot0133> these WERE graphics
[2:48:01] <InugamiTheHound> amazing
[2:48:02] <wookie5358> They were 3D in a 2D world
[2:48:02] <majindusto> SO GOOD
[2:48:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the best
[2:48:03] <$shurtal> i've never seen any of Red's Limit Breaks except Sled Fang
[2:48:03] <+ryosuke91kc> they were bad actually
[2:48:03] <%StripesUltimateEdition> they were off the shits
[2:48:03] <%Kataguro> Mind destroying
[2:48:05] <GiygasDrillBreak> AWESOME
[2:48:05] <Neo_Kaiser> Back in the day? This still looks amazing!
[2:48:07] <%Wrashis> video games would never get better
[2:48:08] <%Estuko> NotLikeThis
[2:48:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The best?
[2:48:10] <%Tyonidus> That's awesome lol
[2:48:11] <ape_hawk> gra...fix?
[2:48:12] <+faithless_zealot> They were "way better than average"
[2:48:13] <@commanderclaw> This was like moving from stage to motion picture
[2:48:13] <+Tokanova> DICK DESTROYING
[2:48:13] <%AncelDeLambert> things being 3D was completely new
[2:48:14] <%fallen92x> It looked amazing
[2:48:15] <Neo_Kaiser> Design beats graphics any day
[2:48:15] <%moogleboy1984> objectively worse than Legend of Dragoon, but better than Legend of Legaia
[2:48:16] <+tuesti> revolutionary tbh
[2:48:17] <Jacobinite> is he joking
[2:48:18] <jellssssss20> The fmvs are still amazing
[2:48:18] <InugamiTheHound> especially the cut scenes
[2:48:19] <+Ryallen> Yahtzee insists that games this old never looked good
[2:48:19] <DarkOmen98> they were just as shit then... just there was nothing better to compare them to
[2:48:19] <misterspotswood> i remember the summons blowing my uncle's mind
[2:48:20] <%fallen92x> Specially the FMVs
[2:48:22] <DarkOmen98> the graphics i mean
[2:48:23] <+CandiAndTheBretts> I just remember being amazed by the sheer length of the game
[2:48:25] <%GarbageNirvana> This was a paradigm shift for me when I first saw it as a kid
[2:48:25] <+ryosuke91kc> when i saw this game i compared it to RE2
[2:48:33] <ammobasket> He's not joking.
[2:48:36] <%zamzoph> It's just like Toy Story!
[2:48:36] <%XzileGaming> went from ffVI graphics to THIS
[2:48:39] <GiygasDrillBreak> the ad for FF7 on the TV in Funcoland was top tier
[2:48:44] <+faithless_zealot> He's not even kidding
[2:48:46] <+Tokanova> It was the toy story of video games
[2:48:46] <Crankthulhu> @WackyGear Nobody liked the Lego people and you could tell we had a way to go with polygons, but the battle stuff was amazing and especially the FMVs
[2:48:47] <wookie5358> It was one of those "there's no way it can ever possibly get better than this" gaame
[2:48:49] <@lewdskeletor13> Was this the first game that was made in color, Grandpa? Kappa
[2:48:52] <chronoxgp> i actually like the 2d backgrounds the most
[2:48:55] <majindusto> THIS CAME OUT A YEAR BEFORE RE2
[2:48:59] <Jflaskd13> LUL shade
[2:49:02] <Silversunburst> THATS NOT FAIR
[2:49:03] <%Darren716> CT looks better tho
[2:49:04] <artoflec> Chrono Trigger is still way nicer to look at than this elaKek
[2:49:06] <%Keyd00d> Crono Trigger looks better aesthetically
[2:49:07] <DarkOmen98> chrono looked better
[2:49:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I prefer the look of Chrono Trigger tho :)
[2:49:08] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat would it be fair to say it was to then what cyberpunk (conceptually) is to now?
[2:49:09] <+cahv123> Yeah, if you took current day video games back to the 1990s people would shit themselves.
[2:49:10] <%MagickBurritoh> Chronotrigger looks better
[2:49:11] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat I like the way Chrono trigger looks
[2:49:12] <+Tokanova> Compare this to its peers at the time tooooo
[2:49:12] <rhus> While Chrono Trigger looks better now, back then, this was nuts
[2:49:13] <%Estuko> @lewdskeletor13 They didn't have colour back then Kappa
[2:49:14] <DarkOmen98> and ff6 / 3
[2:49:16] <Luesagna00> character design on overworld coulda been much better.
[2:49:17] <+Scevda> Ita funny b/c SE seems to rely somewhat on that to this day.
[2:49:22] <InugamiTheHound> chrono cross looked really good as well.
[2:49:22] <misterspotswood> odin's and kinghts of the round's summon scenes left our mouths agape
[2:49:22] <TioXyco> CT looks amazing up to this day still. FF7 looks garbo, aged REALLY bad
[2:49:23] <+NobleJedi> you people are nuts. this looks better
[2:49:24] <shiny_prinny> chrono was consistent
[2:49:24] <+Scevda> That same reaction
[2:49:29] <rytisone> Beeg gun
[2:49:33] <%Tyonidus> bruh go fight all the weapons
[2:49:35] <%fallen92x> People hated 2D during the 3D era
[2:49:37] <%averyoddjew> ah yes, the town that's just a giant GUN
[2:49:39] <+Tokanova> @misterspotswood dont' forget the different bahaumets
[2:49:41] <%Keyd00d> damn right outside the gates
[2:49:41] <%ShichiNoBushi> Fight the Gun!
[2:49:41] <%RupanSen> Late 2D looks better than early 3D but at the time it was still mindblowing
[2:49:44] <%Tennochief> whoa
[2:49:44] <ammobasket> 1997-99 was like being nonstop blown away at game stuff.
[2:49:46] <Ner234> G U N
[2:49:47] <+faithless_zealot> Well, yeah, but ... I dunno if that's a comparison you'd want to make then, right?
[2:49:47] <artoflec> but raw technical graphics ages like fucking milk so this game looks awful now.
[2:49:49] <misterspotswood> @Tokanova that was rad too
[2:49:51] <%Tennochief> this guy looks cool
[2:49:55] <Ion_Laser> This game and Quake 1 were game changers for 3D graphics in Video/Computer games
[2:49:56] <GypsySquid> CT looks great, but it has years of 2D innovations and such behind it.
[2:49:58] <kingbaconcrispy> Yeah of course in hindsight this looks like shit but I remmeber a time when Ocarina of Time was realistic. Now we look at 7th gen games and think they look like garbage when not long ago they were seen as HD.
[2:49:59] <@lewdskeletor13> Fuggins has been streaming Chrono Trigger, y’all should watch it fugginDab
[2:50:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Can't wait for 5D games
[2:50:04] <brambobelurkin> shit 97 till 2010
[2:50:05] <%moogleboy1984> Tekken 3 looks better than this
[2:50:06] <miendrh93> Oh yeah, this guy does that
[2:50:09] <%starotter70> Time for Pat to give mouth to mouth to some kid
[2:50:12] <Tapt58> moon2S Dolphin time moon2S
[2:50:16] <justafoxhere> It would have been nice if I experienced that but being born the year after will do that
[2:50:17] <12gagerager> Chronotrigger aged better, but this was a game that for a time set the standard of 3d graphics in a big way. Aged poorly though.
[2:50:18] <+Fox_Rezard> ahh 3D final fantasy, summons are a graphical jerk of session to be impressed at the animation.... and the dmg.
[2:50:22] <miendrh93> Tries to pick off your wimpybois
[2:50:35] <darcfowler1995> this is where I think the first disc of the Remake is going to end but I could be way off
[2:50:36] <%WackyGear> I got into games during the ps2/gamecube era
[2:50:38] <kingbaconcrispy> It did age poorly compared to 8 and 9
[2:50:46] <artoflec> i mean these pre-rendered scenes still look pretty okay though since they may as well be paintings.
[2:50:47] <%Tennochief> @WackyGear same
[2:50:48] <majindusto> SUCK FACE WITH CHILD TIME lol
[2:50:53] <%Owkono> jotaro was reborn as a little girl
[2:50:57] <kingbaconcrispy> Late games on the 5th gen always look better.
[2:51:03] <ape_hawk> grenades are weapons
[2:51:05] <%Tennochief> Star Fox Assault was my hook
[2:51:08] <%Owkono> grenades
[2:51:13] <ape_hawk> grenades are the best weapon in the game
[2:51:19] <%zamzoph> time to see Hojo?
[2:51:19] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Then I guess you don't see any weapons."
[2:51:27] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat so based upon your suggestion i bought pillars of eternity on sale on steam today and got pillars 2 for 10 bucks physical at a walmart
[2:51:30] <%starotter70> @zamzoph Next town

[2:51:44] <%Kataguro> Shinra, Inc.
[2:51:44] <@lewdskeletor13> This game has very subtle themes about corporate pollution it seems

[2:51:48] <%Wrashis> this is dolphin town
[2:51:58] <ape_hawk> pillars of eternity one is on the switch now, too
[2:52:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "subtle"
[2:52:03] <Luesagna00> the prerendered images look amazing yeah. but the dumb chibi overworld pi-pi character design is so terrible
[2:52:07] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Pillars, that's like Diablo yeah
[2:52:08] <+Scevda> “Subtle” @lewdskeletor13

[2:52:24] <%wsintai> *Stardust Crusader theme intensifies*
[2:52:24] <%Schrodingers_Box> Sounds like Jotaro would love it here.
[2:52:25] <%Tennochief> Jotaro founded this town

[2:52:42] <Koosahmii> Innsmouth. Got it.
[2:52:44] <%SilvaChariot0133> *Ocean Man echoes in the distance*
[2:52:49] <$rekinom> Dolphin Fact: Dolphins ejaculate with such force that if a human woman's insides would be ruptured by the force
[2:52:49] <Neo_Kaiser> In the 60s they were trying to teach dolphins how to find mines underwater and the only way they could think to convince the dolphins to learn is to give them handjobs.
[2:52:50] <%Tearonex> THIS IS TOTALLY GOING TO BE IN REMAKE!!!

[2:59:59] <AtisutoCurry> ohno
[3:00:03] <%Keyd00d> this is how you cpr just INHALE FOR 30 SECONDS

[3:00:05] <%Keyd00d> THEN BLOW
[3:00:06] <Desertfishing> this is the most iconic minigame who could forget about it
[3:00:06] <%Ranryu692> holy shit there's a warframe mod that adds health AND shield capacity?
[3:00:06] <+Scevda> Isk
[3:00:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> How could I forget Cloud unintentionally sexualizing a child?
[3:00:09] <Bladeexe> Not pounding her chest shes dead cloud
[3:00:09] <Luesagna00> the fuck??? doesnt this kinda destroy the moment of her..like being near death??
[3:00:09] <Jolnir> ye kiss the child
[3:00:09] <Neo_Kaiser> This is how Pat makes out with Paige.
[3:00:10] <jellssssss20> I.. I don’t think that old man knows how cpr works
[3:00:11] <Dementedpenguin> I played the game 20 years ago. >_>
[3:00:13] <%Darren716> Her lungs are the menu screen
[3:00:16] <ape_hawk> welp. shes dead
[3:00:17] <EuropanLamprey> "Sorry, you only got a C-Rank, little girl has brain damage now"

[3:00:30] <%RupanSen> it's CPR chat, stop reeing
[3:00:31] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat the most important part of CPR is to take as much time as you can
[3:00:32] <+OkamiDude15> @StripesUltimateEdition hes got super soldier lungs via the mako infusions
[3:00:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> she's dead, Jim.
[3:00:36] <GizmoKSX> Mako lungs: Blue on the bottom.
[3:00:38] <wookie5358> They should have a CPR doll in gold saucer that you do this to for GP
[3:00:40] <Basch71> this is the part where Cloud's lungs collapse
[3:00:40] <InugamiTheHound> I use to breath and exhale just like cloud during this mini game when I was a kid
[3:00:41] <%ElenaManetta> I can't even tell what the gauge wanted you to do
[3:00:41] <Gerik1233> i don't think this one was in brentalfloss's song
[3:00:41] <%wsintai> @jellssssss20 He's getting to know her pretty well now Kappa
[3:00:43] <+Ell1ot> you're not supposed to exhale your whole lung capacity into her. if you do that, her stomach might get too much air and she might puke
[3:00:44] <ミュウレ4242> just cast water breathing.
[3:00:48] <@CoalSavoie> I'm surprised she didn't explode by that point
[3:00:49] <%corepool> bullshit shes dead
[3:00:50] <%ShichiNoBushi> *Vomits into Clumbo's mouth*
[3:00:53] <+tuesti> the chat is killing me
[3:00:53] <%Tearonex> DEAD

[3:10:05] <alwayspronking> Is "Third Birthday" FFVII 3?
[3:10:10] <%Keyd00d> it looks more like ff8
[3:10:11] <@lewdskeletor13> I heard that Third Birthday game was great Kappa
[3:10:15] <+Scevda> Narrator: It wasnt that fun.
[3:10:23] <misterspotswood> i thought they ran out ideas
[3:10:23] <+Shaggnar> Huh
[3:10:24] <Ion_Laser> Hmmm
[3:10:24] <+TheSaintJohn> that's just japan games tho
[3:10:24] <natebud> Yeah, but that's like every Final Fantasy

[3:10:33] <T3merity> AND HIS NAME WAS CLUMBO?
[3:10:34] <+faithless_zealot> @AngriestPat Fun Fact, apparently one of my teacher from college was the art director from the PE series... Small world
[3:10:35] <+OkamiDude15> sfhTHINK big if true
[3:10:36] <%starotter70> hmmmm
[3:10:37] <alwayspronking> NotLikeThis
[3:10:38] <%YourFavoriteShiba> Hmmmmmmmmm
[3:10:38] <Valdorick> So... FF7 is Dragon Quest 4, got it.
[3:10:42] <%Starlight_Gamer> dont see the connection
[3:10:44] <+Ell1ot> how come parasite eve doesn't have death house?
[3:10:44] <%Kataguro> Like...Vincent?
[3:10:45] <+Scevda> Maybe SE is japanese level of uncreative.
[3:10:47] <Ion_Laser> hmmmmmm
[3:10:50] <alwayspronking> Third Birthday is FF X, got it
[3:10:50] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat who's the scientist that joins? I don't remember a lot from FF7
[3:10:54] <thegreenbenis> So the main character is lady cloud. @AngriestPat
[3:10:54] <%vectorless_peon> the antagonist is a weird semi alien Mind Mutant!!!
[3:10:54] <wookie5358> And the big bad is some genetically mutated human
[3:10:55] <%Your_heals> @AngriestPat I don think i appreciate your condescending tone apatFist
[3:10:59] <%Estuko> @T3merity I really wanted you to say "And clumbo was his name-o"
[3:11:01] <rytisone> 3rd Birthday is the best final fantasy game
[3:11:01] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Parasite Eve is Mass Effect 2
[3:11:04] <Cameony> so parasite eve was resident fantasy 7...?
[3:11:06] <%king_wragles> OOOHHHHH
[3:11:09] <Neo_Kaiser> When's Pat gonna play Vagrant Story?
[3:11:16] <blackfacedkermit> Aya and Elena’s designs actually look very similar
[3:11:16] <Jolnir> isnt it scifi ff8?
[3:11:16] <+Scevda> Oh as a vertical slice? Ya okay.
[3:11:18] <@lewdskeletor13> So it’s kinda like DMC and RE4?
[3:11:23] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat do you think Hojo Kefka laughs?
[3:11:34] <%starotter70> Time to Stumbo around
[3:11:36] <majindusto> Go to Pricilla's Room
[3:11:45] <%Wrashis> see now that yuh fie is on the team he can talk to her in this scene
[3:11:50] <+faithless_zealot> @AngriestPat Don't you mean Dr. Klamp, is like hojo?
[3:11:55] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat time for Condor
[3:11:56] <wookie5358> I always imagine Hojo as more of a Palpatine laugher
[3:11:59] <%Wrashis> that was totally worth 30 mins of dumping ass and 3 failed attempts
[3:12:03] <Luesagna00> ff7 got the "used the scrapped idea into its own game"? thought it was a resident evil thing
[3:12:10] <+faithless_zealot> <3
[3:12:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> we must humiliate Shinra for the big parade
[3:12:24] <majindusto> Get Shiva from Pricilla's Bed
[3:12:29] <%XzileGaming> duck feet
[3:12:33] <%ShichiNoBushi> Who's the foul mouthed aviator in Parasite Eve?
[3:12:33] <%AncelDeLambert> oh yeah, Shiva is here
[3:12:34] <+RealPT1> would have got messy if they had to split rights for the book if they used it for ff7
[3:12:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> SHIVA
[3:12:46] <%AncelDeLambert> You betrayed SHIVA!
[3:12:51] <rytisone> Shive, best girl
[3:12:54] <+Talbz> So FFVII is the Umbrella Chronicles of the FF series?

[3:13:37] <EuropanLamprey> Just sandbag the doggo
[3:13:39] <%Wrashis> danger, high voltage
[3:13:42] <@lewdskeletor13> Cats are da best
[3:13:44] <+Ell1ot> there's so much room in the over world. Why are they building cities on top of each other?
[3:13:50] <majindusto> She looks at Cloud
[3:13:53] <+Pendragwn> Could you teach Elmo to sit like that and also to do big damages in combat
[3:13:55] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Good ol' Clumbo
[3:13:57] <Jolnir> NO#
[3:14:03] <+Grayhammatter> counting on you big clumbo
[3:14:04] <Jolnir> GO GET SHPKA
[3:14:07] <wookie5358> Time for the second greatest minigame of all time, next to giving a girl CPR
[3:14:19] <@lewdskeletor13> Elmo is too stumbly to do big damage
[3:14:19] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat you wanted that peace ring, right?

[3:15:03] <%Takreth> Jotaro intensifies
[3:15:03] <+LordFuzzyBuns> I thought Paige was streaming Monster Hunter because I've been in a MHW Hub with a guy named Glucose Guardian, Beerzerker, and QCumber w/ QCumber2004.

[3:15:08] <%AdmiralButtloaf> dont move just whistle twice
[3:15:11] <@lewdskeletor13> I think Pat missed a locker back in RE2
[3:15:12] <%ElenaManetta> I hope Pat was joking when he said this is a town that fucks Dolphins because anything could go in this game as far as I'm concerned
[3:15:12] <%AncelDeLambert> he only has to do Condor once more for the ring
[3:15:13] <+Scevda> Brave of you to stream at the same time as CR

[3:19:15] <%AdmiralButtloaf> ive never done well on this part
[3:19:22] <wookie5358> Remember when President Shinra got impaled, then we escaped and learned all about how Sephiroth destroyed our hometown, and damn near killed Tifa?
[3:19:24] <+Scevda> @ElenaManetta Oh! I ran into that too
[3:19:26] <%Keyd00d> good luck

[3:19:34] <GypsySquid> Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you double time in time with the shouldering and unshouldering, you can score more approval ratings, yeah?

[3:20:42] <GypsySquid> It DOES! NOT! TURN!
[3:20:42] <+Grayhammatter> nope
[3:20:43] <%Owkono> does not turn
[3:20:45] <GizmoKSX> GUN: It's Just a Gun
[3:20:46] <RazHarvey> barry would be proud
[3:20:46] <%starotter70> Isn't there a bunch of places you can go here
[3:20:46] <+HyperCharge_Sam> no shut up pat
[3:20:46] <%Agami23> why the hell do they need a ocean gun??
[3:20:47] <Latija> Genesis is up there right now

[3:20:51] <cronicconquest> Hail G U N
[3:20:52] <asurite_warrior> doesn't swivel
[3:20:53] <%Starlight_Gamer> where is that gun pointed at anyways?
[3:20:53] <@lewdskeletor13> What does it do in trickster?
[3:20:57] <+EdithUpwards> Is it pointed at a city?
[3:20:57] <ammobasket> shush
[3:20:58] <%QueequegTheater> It's for bombing that one specific location
[3:21:02] <sosuke5> Fuck everything in that direction, I guess
[3:21:04] <WanderingSwordsman> what can it be done in trickster?
[3:21:05] <+HyperCharge_Sam> pointed at the ocean
[3:21:06] <+tuesti> and the gun aims generally at Midgar... big brain???
[3:21:07] <%AncelDeLambert> @Starlight_Gamer the entirety of the other continent
[3:21:08] <GiygasDrillBreak> gun is to shoot Wutai
[3:21:11] <%Keyd00d> look it'll be REALY helpful for a specific situation
[3:21:11] <+OmegaFatalis> what they planning on using it for?
[3:21:12] <wookie5358> It's to take out galleons or something
[3:21:14] <+Ell1ot> a stationary gun. if you stand in front of this, you'll be in so much trouble
[3:21:16] <GiygasDrillBreak> no joke, they built a gun to shoot Wutai
[3:21:16] <+Scevda> You see that horizon. I fuckin hate. Im gonna destroy it
[3:21:17] <coyotezappa> Hey is more crossdressing happening?
[3:21:17] <InugamiTheHound> it was suppose to be used against Wutai right?
[3:21:24] <+EdithUpwards> Gun was built for the war.
[3:21:28] <+OmegaFatalis> oh right
[3:21:29] <%ShichiNoBushi> Distracted by dog.
[3:21:30] <ammobasket> in case Godzilla attacks exactly here
[3:21:30] <wookie5358> It can also be used for highly effective fishing
[3:21:35] <%XzileGaming> think of it like artillery, they can aim it up and drop the mortar somewhere else
[3:21:36] <+EdithUpwards> They kept building it after the war ended because lol efficiency.
[3:21:41] <+TheSaintJohn> TV ratings lmao
[3:21:43] <HollowMan190> @coyotezappa. sadly no _*_
[3:21:46] <King_thunder365> Fuck it up super hard
[3:21:48] <red_blaster> Do it perfectly
[3:21:49] <GanksGoneWrong> that guy was soo out of line
[3:21:50] <coyotezappa> the what's the fucking point
[3:21:54] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat wait until the rating hits about 30% on random before you go, then run straight down. Cloud will go down the ranks piecemeal. Then MASH THE BUTTON.
[3:21:55] <+Grayhammatter> do it PERFECT
[3:21:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Be a good Shinra boi
[3:21:58] <+tuesti> TV rating ALL depends on ONE guy

[3:22:36] <cronicconquest> LUL
[3:22:40] <Arek_1> You think maybe Shinra would've used the Junon cannon on Midgar once they create New Midgar like they planned?
[3:22:41] <RazHarvey> WHAT was he thinking?!?!
[3:22:43] <%AdmiralButtloaf> if you do bad they send you a grenade
[3:22:44] <miendrh93> You got given a shitty starting percentage anyway
[3:22:45] <Valdorick> Not 100!? Fucking amateur hour.
[3:22:46] <ha2ken> MC raising the ratings
[3:22:47] <+EdithUpwards> If you fuck up he sends a grenade.

[3:24:26] <%Keyd00d> @Sphincter_Spelunker F
[3:24:42] <miendrh93> I am curious how they're going to execute the chairmen's laughs in the remake.
[3:24:44] <GypsySquid> It's not a cape, tho...it's a coat.
[3:24:44] <Arek_1> "Horse laugh" is what the Japanese called basically any laugh that isn't their more reserved style of laughing.
[3:24:55] <redial_nick> just a few soldiers? what a joke!
[3:25:01] <miendrh93> It's a funny quirk in text, not sure how well it'll go in English voice acting
[3:25:02] <+OmegaFatalis> that's always bugged me. he doesn't wear a fucking cape
[3:25:12] <+Scevda> Jojo pose or dab?
[3:25:14] <%dheng1> Was that solider high?!

[3:57:16] <Zebylth> redxiii is a rantsona
[3:57:18] <InugamiTheHound> lol
[3:57:21] <RazHarvey> best hooman ever
[3:57:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Was Redbull always a animal
[3:57:25] <TimetodiveLTX> tail exposed
[3:57:27] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> big lie
[3:57:28] <InugamiTheHound> red 13 is true furry now
[3:57:29] <+Scevda> SUPER WRONG
[3:57:30] <%Keyd00d> it's very worth
[3:57:32] <TalisKanju> ppp
[3:57:34] <TimetodiveLTX> live onstream
[3:57:34] <+Scevda> ITS MANDATORY
[3:57:34] <+Grayhammatter> those people are so wrong
[3:57:37] <%Kataguro> It's worth it but it's boring
[3:57:40] <NeroInfinite> ADP deniers are 100% wrong.
[3:57:42] <Valdorick> adaption is just... ugh.
[3:57:42] <%Keyd00d> responsible
[3:57:42] <grayjammer> ADP is fucking vital
[3:57:44] <+Grayhammatter> as responsible
[3:57:45] <sosuke5> but the I-frames though
[3:57:50] <Valdorick> Its vital and that's awful.
[3:58:02] <+JacktheMan18> What's ADP?
[3:58:05] <%StripesUltimateEdition> ADP is for the WEAK
[3:58:07] <@JustinianKnight> ah hell yea Red in that outfit
[3:58:08] <+Simketh> ADP is busted rolling. It has to get to a certain point to even feel normal again
[3:58:08] <HeadsHeldHigh> i mean if you're a god you can keep it rather low
[3:58:17] <WisdomHat> @AngriestPat Did you watch the Mauler DS2 series?
[3:58:19] <EuropanLamprey> You only need to get Agility to 99 tbh
[3:58:19] <Cameony> i stopped upgrading ADP at like 15 and just smash with the great club and pray that shit flinches
[3:58:21] <el_phthalo> Adp is important, but you don't need as much.
[3:58:28] <%TheShal> ADP is a waste of levels and therefore souls
[3:58:28] <GiygasDrillBreak> ADP = 20 levels you never use
[3:58:30] <%Keyd00d> go back down
[3:58:30] <Jolnir> pat what earbuds do you use?
[3:58:34] <+PlagueOfGripes> Red in his suit is the best

[3:58:41] <+SuicidalLemmming> never leveled it and beat everything so its not vital

[3:58:43] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> not even hunter x hunter
[3:58:44] <Meekest> Mauler's a shithead anyway LUL
[3:58:44] <%ElenaManetta> not even ur own lps
[3:58:45] <+StreamStopA> Rolling in DS2 is mandatory rolling because of shield nerfs and armor nerf
[3:58:46] <+PlagueOfGripes> It was pretty good
[3:58:51] <%Tennochief> He Plague is here now
[3:58:53] <TalisKanju> @angriestpat Red XIII as a playable character in the remake? YES/NO?
[3:58:58] <Valdorick> 10 hour rebuttal against a 2 hour long video, right?
[3:59:00] <@lewdskeletor13> Mauler is... something
[3:59:01] <NeroInfinite> The shield nerfs are big sad.
[3:59:01] <DKDiamantes> When I play Souls games I pleb it up and just throw every thing at Strength and pray

[4:04:59] <%Wrashis> is pat wearing underwear today
[4:05:00] <%Teintstein> also without undies
[4:05:00] <Blank9> so pat wears assless chaps?
[4:05:01] <GustauveVIII> STEAL SHINRA BETA FROM MARINE
[4:05:02] <ammobasket> Check cloud weapon?
[4:05:03] <Zebylth> paige just steals them sometimes
[4:05:03] <%ElenaManetta> Pat wears the pants and then Paige steals them
[4:05:03] <Arek_1> "You're so hot before you beat me." OpieOP
[4:05:04] <InugamiTheHound> So Paige is Samus from other M and Pat is Adam??
[4:05:04] <%daemonazaezal> his dick goes in the other leg
[4:05:07] <+LordFuzzyBuns> You both are the legs of the pant
[4:05:09] <@JustinianKnight> Pat wears the jorts
[4:05:10] <GypsySquid> E q u a l i t y
[4:05:11] <majindusto> Wee Man Pat
[4:05:12] <+PlagueOfGripes> I always renamed Red XIII to Nanaki
[4:05:14] <red_blaster> Nobody wears the pants in this relationship.
[4:05:16] <%Keyd00d> STEAL
[4:05:17] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You guys literally share pants
[4:05:17] <grayjammer> eat pant
[4:05:19] <42nfl19> but then you both get in the pants right?
[4:05:21] <+Deathtronhammer> Do the pants have glitter on them?
[4:05:25] <%Kataguro> That's good shit
[4:05:28] <GiygasDrillBreak> i renamed Red to Nanaki too
[4:05:29] <@JustinianKnight> its great
[4:05:34] <RazHarvey> great pacing
[4:05:34] <jellssssss20> I’m seeing some yelling of STEAL
[4:05:37] <@JustinianKnight> It's the best for a reason
[4:05:40] <Valdorick> @PlagueOfGripes "Guys, my real name isn't Nanaki, its... Nanaki"
[4:05:42] <@CoalSavoie> "Nanaki isn't my real name. My real name is Nanaki."
[4:05:44] <Cameony> y'all can make fun of jorts all you want but they're the absolute best of both worlds, tough but comfy
[4:05:45] <%republicofu> !uptimme
[4:05:48] <+PlagueOfGripes> because why would anyone still call him Red XIII after you learn what his name is
[4:05:48] <miendrh93> @AngriestPat "Which one of you was fuckin' with the pants"
[4:05:49] <%AdmiralButtloaf> STEAL
[4:05:49] <ammobasket> Cloud weapon!
[4:05:49] <%RupanSen> yeah
[4:05:50] <+sublimynal> it is tho
[4:05:56] <GypsySquid> I mean, it kinda is, but that doesn't mean it's not great.
[4:05:57] <suikudo> I fucking hate this game tbh
[4:05:57] <%Konquerer> 7 is super overrated
[4:05:57] <NeroInfinite> VII is pretty overrated.
[4:05:57] <TioXyco> 7 IS overrated
[4:05:58] <Ion_Laser> WHAT
[4:05:58] <%AdmiralButtloaf> steal
[4:05:59] <+EdithUpwards> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[4:06:01] <%Tennochief> remember, /v/ is always wrong
[4:06:02] <wookie5358> 7 is popular. Of course people will call it overrated
[4:06:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Nooooo
[4:06:03] <%Keyd00d> DansGame
[4:06:03] <RazHarvey> 6 probably has more problems. they don't like strength characters
[4:06:03] <+EdithUpwards> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[4:06:03] <brambobelurkin> Never played it
[4:06:03] <%starotter70> OH NO
[4:06:04] <AnthroMetal> OOF
[4:06:06] <Valdorick> Red13 is his slave name.
[4:06:06] <jellssssss20> Will Pat see it?
[4:06:06] <Ion_Laser> WutFace
[4:06:06] <%Yadogari> I love Omikron
[4:06:06] <otaku9392> @keyd00d @majindusto
[4:06:07] <Malacious> what
[4:06:08] <TalisKanju> They say Final Fantasy X
[4:06:08] <$sl8r4l8r> Find a new accountant
[4:06:08] <%Teintstein> wut
[4:06:08] <%ElenaManetta> That's satire
[4:06:09] <%MrBorisMakarov> oh no
[4:06:10] <Ion_Laser> The Fuck?
[4:06:11] <%Tennochief> GROSS
[4:06:11] <suikudo> I liked FF8 wayyyy more than this
[4:06:11] <+StreamStopA> When they say 7 bad I cry till they leave
[4:06:12] <%Kataguro> Do not trust him
[4:06:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I kinda remember
[4:06:15] <majindusto> It kinda is overrated tho
[4:06:15] <%NWR_James> @Yadogari you monster
[4:06:15] <%RupanSen> 7 is seminal
[4:06:16] <%king_wragles> WHAT
[4:06:16] <TalisKanju> And FF X-2
[4:06:16] <%salty_syd913> oh god
[4:06:16] <InugamiTheHound> is David Cage your accountant?
[4:06:17] <+PlagueOfGripes> was his name Arin
[4:06:18] <Valdorick> Just cut to the case and name Red13 Koby
[4:06:20] <@JustinianKnight> People who say that often have not actually played it
[4:06:22] <DKDiamantes> Yeah, but those are the same people who think X-2 is good so who cares
[4:06:23] <%zamzoph> Paige has an accountant?
[4:06:23] <NeroInfinite> because it's literally the most talked about one non-stop
[4:06:24] <%mh9s> you trust this man with your money
[4:06:26] <LeonSteel> but it is overrated, but still a fantastic game
[4:06:26] <%segonian> why do you trust him with your money?
[4:06:26] <%Piemen99> do not speak that name in this stream
[4:06:27] <GypsySquid> I mean, even VI is kinda overrated, and that's my favorite one.
[4:06:28] <InugamiTheHound> fuck final fantasy 10-2
[4:06:28] <Koosahmii> Time to get a new accountant
[4:06:30] <RazHarvey> 7 is when they got it right again
[4:06:31] <%TheSniperJoe> So Pat and Paige are basically a physical manifestation of The Bryan Setzer's Orchestra's "You're the Boss"?
[4:06:33] <%Keyd00d> LUL
[4:06:36] <zeepyrus> You need a different accountant, Paige
[4:06:37] <Djinnazz> You trust that person with your money??
[4:06:37] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Well, some people love trash writing and don't get anything that's even slightly above that.
[4:06:37] <%ElenaManetta> David Cage's alt account
[4:06:38] <%Yadogari> @NWR_James apatLiz
[4:06:39] <HeadsHeldHigh> There are a LOT of people who like Cage games
[4:06:39] <CrypticMochi> Why would you trust him?
[4:06:39] <+Simketh> Everyone that says 7 is overrated probably LOVES Crisis Core...
[4:06:40] <AnthroMetal> damn plague
[4:06:40] <NeroInfinite> 10-2 is TRASSSHHH
[4:06:41] <King_thunder365> FF7 is my favorite and FF10 is my second favorite.
[4:06:42] <+stuntdoublejesus> 6 is underrated
[4:06:42] <%Kataguro> That's super true
[4:06:43] <Gerik1233> 7's FANTASTIC! Second favorite, behind 4
[4:06:45] <ammobasket> Equip Cloud
[4:06:47] <xGeneralDOOM> IT WAS WOOLIE DansGame
[4:06:47] <%Edgy_Macaroon> get a new accountant. they aren't smart enough to be handling money
[4:06:47] <TimetodiveLTX> bizzaro taste
[4:06:47] <Cameony> david cage games are the best, there's so much garbage in them that you can frisbee them SUPER far
[4:06:47] <%Tennochief> That was cold
[4:06:51] <InugamiTheHound> final fantasy 7 and 8 are best FF games
[4:06:53] <%crowsloft77> Fire him
[4:06:55] <xeros720> pat had that ready
[4:06:56] <GustauveVIII> STEALLLL
[4:06:56] <%AdmiralButtloaf> steal!!!4

[4:06:59] <GustauveVIII> STEAL
[4:07:00] <Djinnazz> STEAL.
[4:07:00] <AnthroMetal> STEAL
[4:07:01] <%Kataguro> Steam, Kazuma
[4:07:02] <+PlagueOfGripes> "We shouldn't judge games by their historical context. Because I'm 12."
[4:07:02] <Valdorick> STEAL
[4:07:02] <%ElenaManetta> what year is it
[4:07:03] <%logoth_> Why do the Shinra have Fartguns
[4:07:04] <%Wrashis> ahhhhhhhh
[4:07:05] <%Kataguro> Steal
[4:07:05] <GustauveVIII> STEALLLLLLL
[4:07:05] <%Darren716> No i looked at those screenshots in 2009 thank you very much
[4:07:06] <jellssssss20> STEAL
[4:07:07] <%logoth_> I fucking LOVE FF6
[4:07:08] <%NWR_James> I played it 5 times. I think the hype on them can be excessive
[4:07:09] <gimmickypizza> David cage is a myth
[4:07:13] <NeroInfinite> They're good but yeah VI is very underrated.
[4:07:13] <$sl8r4l8r> STEAL THE BETA
[4:07:14] <%starotter70> I WANT to play 6
[4:07:18] <+stuntdoublejesus> 6 > 7
[4:07:18] <majindusto> 6 is FANTASTIC
[4:07:19] <ammobasket> Rufus gave cloud a better weapon!
[4:07:19] <Jolnir> suikoden is better
[4:07:20] <GypsySquid> Oof, that aged me Paige.
[4:07:23] <jalexmcc> Clouds sword
[4:07:23] <HeavyMetalIceCream> Most who hate naver got past midgqrd
[4:07:24] <xeros720> i feel like i'd appreciate 8 a lot more now that I understand battle systems better
[4:07:25] <%Anonymasque> I get that "7 is overrated" is a thing but whatever more good game for me.
[4:07:26] <wookie5358> I love 7 to death and say it's my favorite, but if I'm being honest 6 probably deserved that remake more
[4:07:26] <Cameony> what the shit, why's it going so fast in the fight?
[4:07:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> coxSeafood
[4:07:30] <el_phthalo> No, 4 is underrated.
[4:07:31] <%Kataguro> I still need to play 6
[4:07:33] <TalisKanju> I'd play X-2 over 8 and I dislike X-2
[4:07:33] <GypsySquid> The iOS version is garbage.
[4:07:34] <@JustinianKnight> gba one is fine
[4:07:34] <Blank9> 5 is the best
[4:07:36] <+EdithUpwards> sprite art is great
[4:07:37] <@JustinianKnight> yea
[4:07:38] <GypsySquid> GBA all the way.
[4:07:39] <InugamiTheHound> I need to play 6 and 4. But it hard to find a copy of them
[4:07:42] <%ShichiNoBushi> Or the mobile version?
[4:07:44] <+Kaask> 7 is overrated though. Still a good game.
[4:07:46] <+Deathtronhammer> Shevus
[4:07:46] <Gerik1233> 4>7>6
[4:07:48] <@JustinianKnight> mobile is trash
[4:07:49] <xeros720> stupid sexy shiva
[4:07:51] <+LordFuzzyBuns> Never touched a FF game, but the story of 6 and 7 are sick
[4:07:51] <RazHarvey> 1-5 are amazing but 2 is the black sheep by a lot of people
[4:07:52] <%ColonelRozum> yeea dust em
[4:07:52] <GypsySquid> Even though the colors are kinda bled out and the sound took a hit from hardware limitations.
[4:07:53] <Valdorick> Summon the poop of the world.
[4:07:53] <%starotter70> The "Gorgeous" ios version
[4:07:54] <%Kataguro> SNAP
[4:07:54] <AnthroMetal> DDP?!
[4:07:55] <%TheShal> OBLIIIIVIIIION
[4:07:56] <Cameony> crusades start now
[4:07:56] <NeroInfinite> GBA VI is the best one get the new trash outtahere
[4:07:56] <suikudo> Watching people play 7 is so i dont have to fucking do it myself
[4:07:57] <+HyperCharge_Sam> that weird remove the sprites and blur it all together nonsense?
[4:07:57] <%RupanSen> 6 is great but the fans are so fucking annoying
[4:07:57] <hippieofdeath> 5 is weird but charming IMO
[4:07:58] <Heyestus> Paige the young kids didn't grow up on FF at all. it's been over 10 years since a good singleplayer one came out.
[4:07:58] <Wan6Saber> @wookie5358 agreed
[4:07:59] <KiritoStoleMyGirl> Chrono Cross IS DA BEST
[4:07:59] <samirrsp> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[4:08:01] <%DraxTD> new version of what?
[4:08:01] <CrypticMochi> I have the PSN version, does that suck?
[4:08:04] <+StreamStopA> NUT!
[4:08:04] <+projectmanatees> yaay best primal song
[4:08:05] <@JustinianKnight> yep
[4:08:06] <majindusto> NEVER PLAY MOBILE
[4:08:06] <GiygasDrillBreak> new FF6 at least has a pretty Vector
[4:08:06] <coyotezappa> yo does that dog have a stand?
[4:08:08] <InugamiTheHound> IMO final fantasy type 0 is super underrated
[4:08:10] <+Scevda> Have always loved ice lady
[4:08:11] <%Kataguro> N O W F A L L
[4:08:11] <%ColonelRozum> @KiritoStoleMyGirl cmonBruh
[4:08:11] <%Tennochief> Ice Ice Baby
[4:08:12] <TimetodiveLTX> hottie
[4:08:12] <el_phthalo> Oh yeah, Paige, finish FF4
[4:08:16] <DKDiamantes> FF7 is appropriately rated
[4:08:16] <ammobasket> Put Force Stealer on CLOUD!
[4:08:17] <@JustinianKnight> it's highly 'rated' because it rules
[4:08:18] <suikudo> I think the hate people give FF8 is because they were young dumb baby idiots
[4:08:19] <%Keyd00d> it's rated
[4:08:25] <ha2ken> Hey gurl
[4:08:28] <%zamzoph> But IX tho
[4:08:29] <GiygasDrillBreak> FF8 is underrated
[4:08:29] <wookie5358> 7 seems overrated because a lot of people adore it. It seems overrated to people who don't know what it is, but when you know what it actually is, it's warranted hype
[4:08:30] <xeros720> 8 does a lot of animations really well too
[4:08:30] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Anyone using the word overrated is just a contrarian
[4:08:31] <%ShichiNoBushi> "overrated" =/= "not good"
[4:08:31] <+LordFuzzyBuns> Blitzball
[4:08:31] <@JustinianKnight> FF8 is underrated
[4:08:32] <%Keyd00d> Yang...
[4:08:33] <+EdithUpwards> ff10 is the point where I went "Fuck Graphics Forever."
[4:08:34] <+mgskomododragon> 7 felt overrated when i was in highschool just because everyone wouldnt shut up about it and then i got it again for the ps3
[4:08:36] <%NWR_James> Yang's dead
[4:08:37] <Blank9> it's no mario
[4:08:40] <Valdorick> Look, the kind of RPGs 7 was competing against was fucking Wild Arms 2
[4:08:43] <RazHarvey> FF8 has a lot of flaws but its still charming
[4:08:43] <+StreamStopA> Fatty ahead therefore try toung but hole
[4:08:44] <majindusto> FF8 is Underrated tho
[4:08:44] <InugamiTheHound> final fantasy 12 is also underrated IMO
[4:08:46] <@CoalSavoie> Man... 7 is a narrative Goliath
[4:08:51] <%Keyd00d> 8 is good
[4:08:53] <+PlagueOfGripes> all good games go through that period of "UHHH ACK-TUALLY - it was overrated (smug fart smelling face)"
[4:08:55] <DKDiamantes> FF8 was good until the first disc ended
[4:08:56] <%starotter70> No, talk about it you coward
[4:08:59] <Djinnazz> But Gunblades1
[4:09:00] <GiygasDrillBreak> FF12 is just Golden Sun
[4:09:02] <Cameony> FF7 is fuckin fun but I can't play it because JRPGs are not great for how i like to play
[4:09:03] <%terminallyCapriciousz> FF8 is the ***ONLY*** good FF game.
[4:09:03] <NeroInfinite> FF8 is kinda not great.
[4:09:03] <%logoth_> FF8 had COOL THINGS at least
[4:09:04] <+RushUnplugged> there is a reason FF7 shaped a whole generation of RPG
[4:09:04] <+EdithUpwards> 8 is good but people bounce off it
[4:09:06] <King_thunder365> I completely checked out on FF8 after "THE MOMENT"
[4:09:06] <%Kataguro> Steal, Kazuma
[4:09:07] <%starotter70> Whatever...
[4:09:07] <HeavyMetalIceCream> Reminder that Xavier Woods is a coward
[4:09:07] <%AdmiralButtloaf> steal
[4:09:08] <majindusto> FF8 is GREAT
[4:09:08] <%Edgy_Macaroon> 8 is underrated
[4:09:09] <@JustinianKnight> way to prove my point
[4:09:09] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Yeah, you love Pat
[4:09:09] <brambobelurkin> steal
[4:09:10] <%Teintstein> steallllllll
[4:09:10] <+Scevda> Pat, don't talk about yourself like that
[4:09:12] <%ColonelRozum> @DKDiamantes just get rid of everything but laguna
[4:09:12] <InugamiTheHound> @JustinianKnight fuck yeah dude final fantasy 8 is amazing along with chrono cross
[4:09:13] <xeros720> 9 is fuckin great to
[4:09:13] <Blank9> wild arms 2 100% had better gameplay, though
[4:09:13] <Neo_Kaiser> Watch spoonys video on FF8
[4:09:13] <TalisKanju> FF7 is better than Ocarina
[4:09:14] <+EdithUpwards> and it's okay to not like it
[4:09:15] <KiritoStoleMyGirl> Chrono Cross
[4:09:15] <NeroInfinite> FF9 is undervalued I feel.
[4:09:15] <%GarbageQueenEllie> But Paige, FF8 is better than FF4! Don't you know this? SabaPing
[4:09:16] <Jolnir> hates 8. loves 13.
[4:09:23] <$sl8r4l8r> FF8 had good characters and that's it.
[4:09:23] <Blank9> especially outside of battle
[4:09:23] <brambobelurkin> STEALY DAN
[4:09:27] <@CoalSavoie> Somewhere in there
[4:09:27] <%Paralurx> Isn't it soooooo great how they were all from the same orphanage......
[4:09:29] <+oKentucky> 8 has the worst ending
[4:09:31] <+Simketh> FF8's plot suffered from being rushed. Otherwise visually and mechanically great
[4:09:31] <AnthroMetal> yep, it's the card game
[4:09:33] <+sublimynal> do not speak of 13...
[4:09:33] <Djinnazz> steal.
[4:09:36] <GiygasDrillBreak> SEIFER IS A GREAT MAN
[4:09:37] <+geckosheer> FF8 is bollocks
[4:09:37] <DKDiamantes> @ColonelRozum Please, sir, remembering Laguna gives me night terrors
[4:09:37] <%starotter70> The opening is great
[4:09:37] <%TheShal> That game is Triple Triad
[4:09:38] <%logoth_> FF8 wanted to do cool new things but didnt want to go too far
[4:09:38] <Valdorick> 8 has a goodish story... but... its between 7 and 9
[4:09:39] <TalisKanju> FF8 is a broken game
[4:09:39] <%Agami23> its like a shit covered diamond
[4:09:41] <ammobasket> Best High School Anime
[4:09:41] <TimetodiveLTX> i prefer OoT, as a game, to FF7 anyday
[4:09:43] <%Tennochief> 13 had good summons
[4:09:43] <%Anonymasque> 8 was a good time but if you asked me to tell you what happened in it...I couldn't tell you.
[4:09:45] <%Wrashis> ff8 is bad, but i like a lot of it, its a masterpiece compared to 13 for sure
[4:09:46] <+DeaconBluesClues> wasn't he supposed to rob these fucking guys
[4:09:47] <%AdmiralButtloaf> ...maybe
[4:09:48] <%RupanSen> 8 had major issues but it was still a fantastic game
[4:09:49] <InugamiTheHound> I like final fantasy 13 along with 13-2
[4:09:49] <%Tennochief> the Eidolon system was cool
[4:09:50] <%NWR_James> Breaking 8 feels good
[4:09:50] <+Scevda> Nobody should
[4:09:50] <+ElizzGlaster> i lthink 7 is good but because i didn't grow up with it i do think its the greatest of all time but like i agree it was crucial to marking jrps main stream
[4:09:53] <%Konquerer> we all know 13 is the best though
[4:09:54] <+DakotaMacDoodle> FF9 is my fav
[4:09:54] <brambobelurkin> Tactics is best FF
[4:09:55] <Wan6Saber> lol
[4:09:56] <+EdithUpwards> 13 deserves damnatio memorae
[4:09:57] <+Deathtronhammer> OH SNAP BEAST MACHINES
[4:09:58] <%NWR_James> Breaking 8 feels SO FUCKING GOOD
[4:09:58] <wookie5358> I loved the feeling of progression, and 8 entirely negates it because the game is easier if you beat it at level 1
[4:09:58] <MetroidSlayerP7> I damn near shit my pants when I saw gunblades back in the day
[4:09:59] <%logoth_> Again with the beast machines
[4:10:00] <NeroInfinite> "LIGHTNING WAS GOD"
[4:10:00] <King_Wolf_Rigger> BEAST MACHINES WAS GOOD
[4:10:01] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> No one said Beast Machines
[4:10:03] <Jolnir> LUL
[4:10:03] <Cameony> there needs to be a version of FF7 where you can just switch to Tifa and punch-girl your way to victory
[4:10:05] <xeros720> 13 gets better 30 hours in, which is fuckin dumb
[4:10:05] <@JustinianKnight> 13 is a shiny hallway
[4:10:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Tell us more about Beast Wars, Peach!
[4:10:07] <RazHarvey> its pretty
[4:10:09] <%Paralurx> I talk about how 13 is just Toriyama jerking off to his waifu
[4:10:11] <honzoh> um why aint his dude FURIED?
[4:10:12] <%daemonazaezal> STRAIGHT FUCKING LINE
[4:10:13] <%ColonelRozum> @DKDiamantes he duh best part though he got gun and weak ankles
[4:10:14] <Gerik1233> 8 would be awesome if Squall died at the mid point
[4:10:15] <jellssssss20> Opinions on 10-2 Paige?
[4:10:17] <%daemonazaezal> that FF13
[4:10:17] <%Tennochief> Summons were great
[4:10:18] <%logoth_> Beast Machines music was actually really bad
[4:10:18] <majindusto> But Beast Machines is Good tho
[4:10:18] <%Agami23> hey paige, optimus primal sucks!
[4:10:19] <hippieofdeath> But destiny is destiny tho!
[4:10:19] <Cameony> let everyone else be NPC controlled
[4:10:21] <Basch71> 13's first half sucked then it become nonexistent in the second half
[4:10:23] <+EdithUpwards> 13 should get the PARANOIA Fifth Edition treatment.
[4:10:24] <GizmoKSX> Beast Machines, when Optimus Primal turned into a brainwashed zealot moron.
[4:10:24] <NeroInfinite> Beastmachines had...weird music
[4:10:26] <%Kataguro> The MK theme?
[4:10:27] <wookie5358> 13 is okay as a not final fantasy
[4:10:30] <%TheShal> The best thing about FFXIII, was Type Zero
[4:10:31] <DKDiamantes> @ColonelRozum LUL
[4:10:31] <+Deathtronhammer> Beast Wars > Beast Machines
[4:10:32] <+DeaconBluesClues> what is a shinra beta
[4:10:33] <soraabora> oh man i still love the 13 music
[4:10:33] <mayorrev> @angriestpat hey should I get this on switch or wait until dragon quest drops on switch?

[4:10:41] <%logoth_> Beast Machines was awful
[4:10:42] <RazHarvey> uh oh
[4:10:44] <Valdorick> Beast Machines was the fucking worst.
[4:10:45] <%terminallyCapriciousz> PAIGE beast machines is my KINK
[4:10:47] <%Wrashis> which 13 in the trilogy is the one with the death metal chocobo theme @AngriestPat
[4:10:47] <Cameony> what the fuck is beast machines
[4:10:47] <dailylifewithry> I like 6, 7, 10, and 13.
[4:10:49] <@JustinianKnight> I'm gonna play the shit out of the FF8 remaster
[4:10:49] <InugamiTheHound> final fantasy 13 was fine! Type 0 needs more love
[4:10:50] <TalisKanju> Beast Machines is trash
[4:10:50] <RazHarvey> lots of kids love that show
[4:10:50] <Zulrez> @AngriestPat thoughts on 15?
[4:10:51] <Gerik1233> 13 if good. but not great
[4:10:52] <+EdithUpwards> BEAST MACHINES IS GUNDAM SEED WITH TRANSFORMERS
[4:10:56] <Neo_Kaiser> What happened to Dinobot in Beast Machines?
[4:10:56] <xeros720> you should buy 7, dq is gonna come out in november
[4:10:58] <GiygasDrillBreak> Beast Machines was garbage, absolute feces
[4:10:59] <%zamzoph> @Tennochief oh no, I forgot but now remember
[4:11:00] <GizmoKSX> Nightscream, irritating bat boy.
[4:11:01] <+EdithUpwards> It's gundam seed level bad
[4:11:03] <Cameony> oh, ok, thanks edith
[4:11:03] <Wan6Saber> Beast Wars > Beast Machines, indeed
[4:11:04] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I personally don't like mech shows. But I'll listen to Paige talk about it for days
[4:11:04] <+Deathtronhammer> The only episode of Beast Machines I really liked was the final one were Megatron was in the form of Optimal Optimus' form.
[4:11:10] <Valdorick> @EdithUpwards HOLY SHIT! Yes
[4:11:10] <+PlagueOfGripes> remember that time Rattrap ate out some guy's asshole for half an episode, then cried
[4:11:12] <KiritoStoleMyGirl> Dragon Megatron is cool
[4:11:13] <wookie5358> 13-2 is a mindless fun time, but holy shit that DLC model in the original PS3 version..
[4:11:14] <%NWR_James> Paige, if a show makes you FEEL then it's ART. RESPECT ART
[4:11:16] <NeroInfinite> Good thing I dropped off once I saw Cheetor was turned into trash.
[4:11:20] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Wait, I've only seen the first season, they broke it?
[4:11:20] <%Kataguro> The dick drained her coolness
[4:11:20] <%Teintstein> is there still a black panther that turns into a cassette?
[4:11:21] <Omega1180> Its terrible.
[4:11:23] <@CoalSavoie> Did the ports ever fix the magic def. bug?
[4:11:23] <+sublimynal> seed at least had cool designs
[4:11:24] <+Tunamanguy> she got the DICK
[4:11:26] <%zamzoph> she also got a 4Head
[4:11:27] <GiygasDrillBreak> Bayformers wasn't the first bullet in Transformers, Beast Machines was
[4:11:28] <+Scevda> Remember that time this stream was about Pat's asshole?
[4:11:28] <%GarbageQueenEllie> The dick makes you WEAK
[4:11:31] <%Tennochief> @PlagueOfGripes sounds like prison
[4:11:36] <brambobelurkin> got piped down
[4:11:40] <+StreamStopA> she get's 1 dick and boom she a thot
[4:11:42] <TimetodiveLTX> Men weaken the legs
[4:11:44] <RazHarvey> moon prism power?
[4:11:49] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Remember that one guy in chat saying we should get over ff13 cuz it was 10 years ago? Look at Paige on Beast Machines LUL
[4:11:49] <honzoh> she got the tiger dick
[4:11:50] <AnthroMetal> aight fam, night time.
[4:11:51] <GizmoKSX> That Fuzor dick.
[4:11:52] <CrystalSlimeV> She got too much dick
[4:11:53] <+LordFuzzyBuns> She got a bigger dick
[4:11:55] <%Kataguro> Yeah, I like Vriska too
[4:11:58] <+PlagueOfGripes> I'm reading the IDW run of Transformers now, where they explain the origins of BEAST
[4:11:59] <Valdorick> Spiddies
[4:12:00] <%starotter70> Paige loves spider tits
[4:12:04] <King_Wolf_Rigger> HOLD ON, Beast Wars isn't Beast Machines?
[4:12:06] <%Tennochief> how about we talk about Transformers Animated now?
[4:12:09] <Valdorick> Big 'ole Spiddies
[4:12:13] <@JustinianKnight> got the BEETA
[4:12:13] <GiygasDrillBreak> Beast Wars = Dinobot
[4:12:14] <%Tennochief> Transfores Animated was fucking great
[4:12:18] <+EdithUpwards> beast wars is the terrible one about relationships
[4:12:19] <%GarbageQueenEllie> She became the series Broodmare. where the bad writing makes the female character suck
[4:12:21] <MetroidSlayerP7> I think I saw one episode of Beast Machines and said, "No. I'm an adult now." and I was never a child from then on.
[4:12:21] <GiygasDrillBreak> Beast Machines = die in a tire fire
[4:12:22] <brambobelurkin> Megatron did nothing wrong
[4:12:23] <RazHarvey> ohhhhh
[4:12:26] <Cameony> beta is that move that's basically just a big fire explosion, right?
[4:12:27] <+prism_zet> how do skeleton tits work
[4:12:28] <%Sovspot> how come you didnt name tifa teetfa
[4:12:29] <+StreamStopA> great now i gotta go watch plague's video with the spiders
[4:12:31] <honzoh> Man i wana watch beast wars again
[4:12:32] <RazHarvey> that you were talking about beast wars
[4:12:33] <%logoth_> Oh so it was made by different people, thats why it sucks!
[4:12:45] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Damn, I loved Beast Wars, thought Beast Machines was just a re-branding
[4:12:50] <NeroInfinite> He wiped his butt with the beast wars script and called it a show
[4:12:51] <majindusto> Blackarachnia was apearently based on a lap dancer
[4:12:52] <+TheSaintJohn> I'd listen to Paige's Beast Wars-cast
[4:12:55] <%cvp5127> wasnt it mainframe
[4:13:04] <%AdmiralButtloaf> i dont know of any major steal shit after this
[4:13:08] <%logoth_> lmao, Beasties
[4:13:08] <+PlagueOfGripes> but who is the most fuckable
[4:13:14] <Omega1180> remember in beast wars when megatron brushes his sentient beast form head with a big toothbrush.
[4:13:14] <Cameony> cloud
[4:13:15] <%NWR_James> @TheSaintJohn I'd be better if she had a bottle of wine with her while she talked
[4:13:15] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Paige-led Beast Wars reboot when
[4:13:16] <%segonian> Gonna play Siege with my brother. Catch you in the vod. Night guys!
[4:13:18] <+prism_zet> I wanted to work for mainframe so bad
[4:13:19] <%logoth_> Furries should be called Beasties
[4:13:20] <%starotter70> huh
[4:13:20] <%Kataguro> Exrotic
[4:13:20] <InugamiTheHound> Final Fantasy 7,8 are the best one, The 10 and 9,12 and after that 13-2, type 0, FF15 and 13
[4:13:22] <King_Wolf_Rigger> AHHH, thank you for straightening that out?
[4:13:22] <%wsintai> "Allegedly"
[4:13:23] <Wan6Saber> ayy lmao @AngriestPat
[4:13:26] <honzoh> THE RHO=INO
[4:13:27] <%Tennochief> Remember how Silverbolt became a peacock
[4:13:27] <%Kataguro> Optimus Primal
[4:13:30] <DaveStrider55> didnt Rufus give you a weapon for clumbo?
[4:13:30] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> coxMistake
[4:13:31] <+sublimynal> LUL
[4:13:31] <+Deathtronhammer> Optimus Primal is the most fuckable
[4:13:32] <%RubberFistFight> oh man you're still going
[4:13:32] <TalisKanju> Yeah, I agree. I prefer Ocarina as a game to FF7, but I think FF7 is more interesting
[4:13:33] <King_thunder365> Starscream
[4:13:34] <King_Wolf_Rigger> You know too much lol
[4:13:35] <Valdorick> So wait... Beast Machines is... Canada's fault? I KNEW IT! Between Justin Bieber, DeGrassy Jr High, and Beast Machines, I'll never forgive the Canadians!
[4:13:37] <%king_strongstyle> Allegedly
[4:13:39] <GiygasDrillBreak> Dinobot
[4:13:41] <GizmoKSX> Waspinator
[4:13:42] <JurassicRaptor> Any are the most fuckable if you're brave enough
[4:13:42] <misterspotswood> are these just robot fursonas?
[4:13:44] <+PlagueOfGripes> "it depends on what flavor I want that day"
[4:13:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat's fucking face when Paige said "that depends" is exactly how I feel.
[4:13:46] <NeroInfinite> Waspinator
[4:13:46] <mayorrev> I'm trying to clear up some stuff on my EShop wishlist, should I get RE1, RE4, FF7, DMC, or BABA?
[4:13:46] <RazHarvey> i'm not into that
[4:13:46] <%radda343> I had no idea paige knew this much about ttransformers
[4:13:46] <WisdomHat> @AngriestPat Remember when they made Rhinox evil for no reason?
[4:13:47] <brambobelurkin> 2
[4:13:48] <+EdithUpwards> ew
[4:13:49] <Djinnazz> they WERE robots
[4:13:49] <%zamzoph> @AngriestPat BUT WHICH FORM THO
[4:13:50] <%Estuko> which form
[4:13:51] <%Tennochief> remember how that weird plant girl never got a toy
[4:13:52] <Omega1180> dinobot best bot
[4:13:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Paige. They're robot furries.
[4:13:54] <+apocplz> which one is the most like a skeleton? 🤔
[4:13:54] <Jolnir> debatable
[4:13:54] <%starotter70> ok, when Paige came downstairs, I did not expect this to devolve into a rant about Beast Machines
[4:13:55] <InugamiTheHound> they are robot furries
[4:13:57] <Cameony> which one is disguised as a skeleton?
[4:13:57] <+EdithUpwards> furries are doing magic rituals
[4:13:58] <%goose_attack_almanac> They're Clankies
[4:13:59] <honzoh> They are not furries lol
[4:14:00] <misterspotswood> called it, robot fursonas
[4:14:00] <%MrBorisMakarov> oh no
[4:14:03] <majindusto> Poor Waspinator BibleThump
[4:14:04] <EuropanLamprey> Only a few
[4:14:04] <%Kataguro> Paige, you've talked about this before. You want Optimus Primal to talk to you in a sexual way
[4:14:05] <honzoh> They are robot sex machines
[4:14:06] <Wan6Saber> damn, is Paige such a nerd, about this shit jennLOL
[4:14:08] <+LordFuzzyBuns> I don't go for either, man
[4:14:09] <InugamiTheHound> furries can wear suits
[4:14:11] <RazHarvey> robo furries, gotcha Kappa
[4:14:12] <GypsySquid> ...what would they be called if they're animal suits but without fur, on account of metal?
[4:14:12] <%srkAres> are they "sky n-words"?
[4:14:12] <Djinnazz> BOTsonas.
[4:14:13] <%RupanSen> are Gundam pilots technically furries?
[4:14:14] <%king_strongstyle> Rurries
[4:14:15] <%NWR_James> by the content of his suit
[4:14:15] <+PlagueOfGripes> beast machines need the suit so they can EXIST in our world
[4:14:15] <+sublimynal> I think we've discovered something
[4:14:17] <%segonian> furries in disguise
[4:14:17] <+EdithUpwards> Unknown Armies said so
[4:14:17] <Malacious> LUL
[4:14:18] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat "Furformers: furries in disguise. Furformers, more than meets the EEYYYYYEEEESS"
[4:14:19] <+ElizzGlaster> @AngriestPat you forget that pagie wants to fuck a skeleton
[4:14:22] <%DedlokPM> Beast Machines was 100% made by Mainframe
[4:14:22] <+Scevda> I will definitely judge them based on that yues
[4:14:25] <mrjohncarlton> But the transmetals don't really have fur anymore
[4:14:26] <King_Wolf_Rigger> That sounds like the oposite of what you should do lol
[4:14:27] <%Teintstein> judge him not by the color of his suit, but the contents of his fursona
[4:14:27] <TimetodiveLTX> furries would argue the suit is no disguise, I think
[4:14:29] <%luftraumm1> is a furry not entitled to the sweat of his brow?
[4:14:36] <GizmoKSX> Maximize your pleasure
[4:14:36] <%Owkono> dont forget to grab the ifrit materia first after boss
[4:14:38] <TalisKanju> You mean Cloud N-words
[4:14:39] <+Deathtronhammer> I love Megatron's voice
[4:14:42] <ammobasket> "Does Bruce Wayne put on a suit, or does the Bat Man take one off?"
[4:14:45] <GizmoKSX> YEEES
[4:14:46] <%XeroSigmaPrime> DAVID CAGE IS SEXY?!
[4:14:47] <WisdomHat> Maximise Dong
[4:14:48] <+PlagueOfGripes> who is the least fuckable
[4:14:51] <+Deathtronhammer> David Kaye has an amazing vocal range
[4:14:51] <@CoalSavoie> Yuffie wpn
[4:14:52] <+EdithUpwards> Did she just call David Cage sexy D:
[4:14:52] <%Yadogari> No
[4:14:52] <GiygasDrillBreak> YYYYEEEESSSSssssss
[4:14:53] <%AdmiralButtloaf> shuriken
[4:14:53] <TalisKanju> ...or Clumbo N-words
[4:14:54] <Omega1180> by the allspark.
[4:14:54] <@JustinianKnight> yuffie weapon
[4:14:54] <Meekest> Is a furry not entitled to the strength of his knot
[4:14:54] <RazHarvey> yuffie
[4:14:56] <%Owkono> bort
[4:14:56] <%Tennochief> Bat guy
[4:14:58] <shadowstep1998> I heard that as david cage and got confused
[4:14:59] <Jolnir> its coming
[4:15:00] <+KaosMachina> more like the sweat of his sheath
[4:15:01] <+LordFuzzyBuns> "Are You Cumming" in Megatron voice
[4:15:03] <%Tennochief> the Bat guy is AWFUL
[4:15:06] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Kkkkkk
[4:15:19] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Paige has a thing for DAVID cAGE
[4:15:20] <%dheng1> Here comes the dope boss music
[4:15:21] <@CoalSavoie> Hell yeah Sesshoumaru
[4:15:24] <RazHarvey> the THING FF7 style
[4:15:25] <majindusto> I have an awesome Optimus Primal figure that would make Paige jealous
[4:15:28] <+PlagueOfGripes> he brought the cummies
[4:15:29] <Arek_1> A disguise is to conceal one's identity. I don't think that's their point.
[4:15:30] <$sl8r4l8r> Oh, no I did the bad audition
[4:15:32] <MetroidSlayerP7> Do not evoke the David Cage! Do not speak his name!
[4:15:34] <Valdorick> Look, we all know who the most fuckable guy is - we've heard his sex voice the entire time. Roll the Megatron "yes" montage.
[4:15:34] <%Emperor_Machinus> Something something Furries compared to Dio and bread
[4:15:36] <JurassicRaptor> Optimus Prime voiced by David Cage is the worst timeline
[4:15:38] <%tweedler92> YEEsssssss
[4:15:41] <%Teintstein> got another pewp
[4:15:43] <shadowstep1998> can you explain beast machine?

[4:16:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat If Cloud was a Transformer which one would he be? Feel free to restrict yourself to Beast Wars/Beast Machines if you wish.

[4:17:10] <+r_Foeburden87> And Megatron is still upgraded from T rex to Dragon
[4:17:10] <wookie5358> Essentially, people wanted money and things happened. Got it.

[4:17:55] <%DedlokPM> Beast Machines was the Maximals coming back to Cybertron and Optimus going all hippie and saying Cybertron must become plant based again. Meanwhile their former allies get completely changed and mind fucked and become bad guys, most of which unwillingly except for Rhynox which was all "FUCK NATURE AND FUCK YOU OPTIMUS PRIMAL! I AM AN EVIL TANK NOW!"

[4:24:37] <+PlagueOfGripes> souls get left out on the counter too long (thousands of years)
[4:24:38] <GiygasDrillBreak> crystal mako = materia

[4:25:02] <%zamzoph> @TalisKanju The Sephiroth you chase around the whole game is really Jenova
[4:25:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Materia is crystallized Mako. And Mako is soul juice that comes from all living things on the planet.
[4:25:08] <%Edgy_Macaroon> planet juice then
[4:25:10] <+EdithUpwards> FUCK OFF
[4:25:11] <%Anonymasque> So does sephiroth want all the semen?

[4:26:58] <%starotter70> Pants shitting
[4:26:59] <$sl8r4l8r> BEING WRONG
[4:27:00] <+r_Foeburden87> just Cast Crazy Talk
[4:27:02] <%Anonymasque> Wait did you win already?
[4:27:04] <King_thunder365> Teleport uppercut
[4:27:07] <+PlagueOfGripes> it's undulating.
[4:27:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat is actually underpowered.
[4:27:09] <megaminimechamocha> LOOK I'VE NOTICED TOO MANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THIS PLOT AND FMA BROTHERHOOD NOW
[4:27:09] <mayorrev> @angriestpat Paige sounded like a toddler when you asked if she made a friend
[4:27:10] <%TheShal> Meteor
[4:27:11] <%Owkono> IFRIT
[4:27:11] <RazHarvey> yea or crazy talk
[4:27:14] <@CoalSavoie> WRONG
[4:27:15] <%SolverCODO> It's like when you drop your vocal folds down and tighten your throat around them
[4:27:19] <%PauliusMaximus> is this what inspoired part 7?
[4:27:20] <@CoalSavoie> Not you, them
[4:27:20] <%Tennochief> lightning and fire blasts with my fingers
[4:27:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> The final boss is the vagoo
[4:27:21] <MetroidSlayerP7> Jenova's tiddies
[4:27:22] <%GarbageNirvana> I'd summon trash and throw it at people like Tetsuo
[4:27:23] <mayorrev> I diiiiiid
[4:27:23] <NeroInfinite> It'd be throwing pat at someone like a missle
[4:27:24] <TimetodiveLTX> "It's Tuesday" improv exercise
[4:27:24] <Cameony> my limit break would be stretching, popping some bones in my back I didn't know existed and cumming so hard I shoot a hole through the enemy
[4:27:26] <shiny_prinny> Bosses get tough around materia keeper
[4:27:26] <%juxtest> The ass of Jenova
[4:27:26] <%ColonelRozum> paige would fire a massive mustard bottle at the monster like some kind of beam canon
[4:27:27] <%SolverCODO> that's that sound, i think, Paige
[4:27:27] <%Wrashis> his name is john cena
[4:27:30] <Djinnazz> The one you fight in the end IS Jenova
[4:27:31] <%Ranryu692> when do you fight the dick?
[4:27:31] <Valdorick> No Pat, because the Head is the crux of Advent Children!
[4:27:33] <TimetodiveLTX> that would be my limit break
[4:27:33] <%ElenaManetta> Too much trouble
[4:27:33] <%Wrashis> his time is now
[4:27:36] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> monkaS
[4:27:36] <EuropanLamprey> When's the boss battle against the Vulva of Jenova?
[4:27:36] <el_phthalo> Paige's limit break would be a giant sword.
[4:27:39] <%Konquerer> getting resident evil vibes from jenova
[4:27:41] <mrjohncarlton> And his name is JEN NOVA
[4:27:44] <+sublimynal> clumbo you liar!
[4:27:44] <%Edgy_Macaroon> one of these days
[4:27:47] <gamma00> clumbo no explain good
[4:27:49] <misterspotswood> jenova's thiccness
[4:27:51] <+PlagueOfGripes> I forgot there's a "explain this crazy shit to the viewer" option
[4:27:53] <JibbaJabro> no explanation is ever given for Cloud getting that sweet combi-sword
[4:27:55] <megaminimechamocha> Big Honking Dick of Jenova
[4:27:56] <King_thunder365> And he named the baby...JENOVA
[4:28:00] <+StreamStopA> Paiges limit break is being able to function as a normal human for 1 min
[4:28:05] <RazHarvey> WRONG well maybe
[4:28:07] <soraabora> and no one else noticed
[4:28:08] <Valdorick> Paige's limit break would be making enemies as sick as she is.
[4:28:10] <Meekest> How did no one notice there was a boss fight happening
[4:28:15] <TalisKanju> Sure thing, that's about it Clumbo
[4:28:17] <reonome> shitting his pants
[4:28:17] <+sublimynal> papaya pa paya
[4:28:19] <%starotter70> @StreamStopA Sure that's not her Level 4?
[4:28:20] <jellssssss20> The titties of Jenova... Plague?
[4:28:23] <blackorchidKI2> Deadly Rave.
