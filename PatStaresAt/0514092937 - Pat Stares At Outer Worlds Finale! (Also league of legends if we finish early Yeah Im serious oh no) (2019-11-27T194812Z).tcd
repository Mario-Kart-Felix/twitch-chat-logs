[0:03:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yes...the poor fool
[0:03:33] <%deviljhojho_> Imagine Pat going on to become this huge league streamer
[0:03:40] <%Gimmpy2143> he said he might play league
[0:03:41] <%Gimmpy2143> or DS
[0:03:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Welp at leats we have Woolie LUL
[0:03:55] <%cureneckbeard> lilypatchu
[0:04:01] <%vixenpunch> I desperately wanna see him play league

[0:04:09] <%vixenpunch> I’m excite
[0:04:12] <deadredeyez> y not overwatch comp
[0:04:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Indivisible is a good game tho
[0:04:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat just hates it
[0:04:28] <valriot> EHHHH
[0:04:33] <+Shoosler> woolie is playing death stranding..
[0:04:35] <valriot> It's low key awful
[0:04:43] <+Shoosler> not indivisible
[0:04:43] <%Gimmpy2143> its not awful
[0:04:47] <%Gimmpy2143> just niche
[0:04:55] <hot4dukat> sup ya'll?
[0:04:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yup..my niche LUL
[0:05:00] <%deviljhojho_> it depends on your definition of good
[0:05:08] <%vixenpunch> Style over substance game
[0:05:12] <valriot> Having every fight be pointless and require the same combo because it doesn't matter isn't a niche game
[0:05:13] <%vixenpunch> Aka woolie bait
[0:05:14] <hot4dukat> Everyone get the new Picard comic?
[0:05:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> It reminds me of the Mario and Luigi games
[0:05:26] <+imadoc91> Man, I just got done watching the star wars bit on the podcast.

[0:06:22] <%Shikari21> i cant wait for league the salt is gonna be glorious
[0:06:34] <valriot> It's not about how, it's about enemies and exp being non existent punchbags and utterly worthless content

[0:07:24] <+imadoc91> All I'm gonna say, take it or leave it is you like Grey Jedi and shit and you're pissed about it not being in star wars anymore then go watch clone wars and rebels
[0:07:24] <valriot> Every enemy in Indivisible is just "I hit block at right time". less deep than Pokemon
[0:07:29] <+imadoc91> cause it's still there
[0:07:38] <+imadoc91> it's just hidden in the cartoons
[0:07:53] <+Diamond_Dynamo> You ever think about the fact that the Empire in Star Wars only exists for like 20 years total?
[0:08:01] <%Ranryu692> the comics have some cool shit too
[0:08:10] <%Faustgesicht> is most of the Parvati stuff over?

[0:08:59] <%ogtrashwizard> moth, did you even need to ask
[0:09:03] <valriot> We're watching Pat, shame isn't a concept anymore
[0:09:05] <+imadoc91> maybe plague will get them into it eventually.
[0:09:17] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I'm nothing but shame, actually, but it equals out to effectively the same thing
[0:09:18] <gojirarads> blobdance
[0:09:20] <+Neoepochx> You mean Pat and Woolie are talking about shit they have no idea what they are talking about again?
[0:09:21] <%JonaFett69> im only here for the league of legends

[0:20:12] <%Alpha8087> Pat you should stream watching Woolie stream
[0:20:14] <%miguelrod777> SOLIDUS ASSEMBLE
[0:20:15] <AMaidIndeed> Call upon him like the Power of Grey Skull
[0:20:15] <%VantomPayne> Death Snailing is really strong
[0:20:16] <%Alpha8087> It would be gold
[0:20:18] <%boxofhooligans> Solidus?!
[0:20:25] <+NitronStreams> The Woolie Stranding Experience
[0:20:31] <%Soulbishop> Listen woolie dropped a ladder and watched it roll down hill while he teared up @AngriestPat
[0:20:45] <Cycrosa> the content literally creates itself with pat's and woolies' streams
[0:20:49] <%MelBrooksKA> Isn't Solidus already getting paid to edit Woolie's work?
[0:20:53] <%Fenrirlives> @angriestpat is the internet all good?
[0:20:55] <tigerfang86> Beautiful
[0:20:56] <%Soulbishop> Help him please
[0:20:59] <%Alpha8087> No
[0:21:00] <%deviljhojho_> perhaps not
[0:21:02] <%Takreth> I mean Pat did a backflip off a cliff with an anti-matter bomb yesterday
[0:21:02] <Sapphire_Breeze> does Woolie know
[0:21:03] <tigerfang86> no
[0:21:04] <%Taisuru> @Soulbishop Ya'll gotta PM me the clip of that
[0:21:07] <%DjFrostBite95> rooSpy
[0:21:09] <HarraceHarrison> Woolie hates items like Ajna hates money
[0:21:10] <%cureneckbeard> Woolie climbed halfway down a ladder and then jumped off and broke all his stuff
[0:21:11] <%Bailey__gaming> @AngriestPat btw Titanfall 2 is on PS Plus for december
[0:21:19] <Cycrosa> roudem
[0:21:22] <%Tallie> pat why are you considering league , what made you hate yourself as much as me
[0:21:23] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @AngriestPat He tried to place a ladder in a red zone basically telling him he couldnt
[0:21:27] <valriot> Woolies brain is fight games and character action, everything else got purged
[0:21:32] <%Sephirios> Sephirios subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:21:34] <%boxofhooligans> Pat's internet provides me 5 mb 1/10 would buy again
[0:21:48] <simifu> Play with friends if you get into league, if you solo, you'll hate the game
[0:21:52] <%deviljhojho_> i believe it
[0:21:59] <shiny_prinny> "do you know who i am"
[0:21:59] <%Tenkay> Tenkay subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Hey 19 months thats like more than 2 babies. Never expected you to play League but i hope you have fun man

[0:22:10] <%MelBrooksKA> How does it feel Pat, to be a red bar
[0:22:14] <%miguelrod777> ok millenial
[0:22:21] <%GarbageNirvana> As someone who's worked in a call center, corporate pretty much requires you to go through that shit or else they get on your ass about it
[0:22:23] <simifu> You'll hate it less with friends at least LUL
[0:22:32] <%driemen> driemen subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! I want to yell anytime you talk about Blizzard properties. Keep up the good work, Crazy Talk!
[0:22:37] <bigbrothergannon> where are the strands?
[0:22:38] <%vixenpunch> If you get a ranking in death stranding like in DMC or a platinum game, then the most logical conclusion is that you should play it without consumables
[0:22:39] <%GarbageNirvana> Also why I'll never work at a call center again
[0:22:40] <+BIumen> pat how much money do I throw at twitch to play league with you
[0:22:41] <Nina96> Pat has more boomer power than we think

[0:26:20] <%TDAWS_MP132> you did the last part twice LUL
[0:26:21] <marvel877> That one movie with Paul Bettany playing the angel Gabriel?

[0:26:21] <%Taisuru> apatBig Caucasian
[0:26:22] <%Alpha8087> We need a coolpat emote with Pat's arms crossed leaning over
[0:26:25] <veldinmusic> It truly does
[0:26:25] <+Zrams3y> YOU CAN JUST GOOGLE THE DANCE YOU AWFUL GINGER FUCK
[0:26:27] <%xvalltendo> @AngriestPat so i take it you're having fun with league...?
[0:26:28] <%dekkitout> DAMMIT! Pat IS a league streamer
[0:26:33] <waifoong98> well chat, just wait til his smugness turn into PJSalt LUL
[0:26:39] <%Ayotocorp> Ayotocorp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Oh boy, does this mean Fortnite's going to be on the channel soon?
[0:26:43] <+lethallunacyx> Oh that's what that was?
[0:26:46] <+DesertPenguin> yeaaa
[0:26:47] <+2DSuperiority> you'll get to the point where you spazm and clap violently
[0:26:51] <%cureneckbeard> it should be called the turk dance.
[0:26:54] <Nina96> wait not even that dance is orginal?
[0:26:55] <%Ranryu692> THAT'S what you're referencing?!
[0:26:56] <critfumble_> @AngriestPat its cool and pretty funny that you picked now to get into league considering whats happening to DOTA right now
[0:26:56] <+DesertPenguin> they stole scrubs
[0:27:01] <%dekkitout> Good lore, Pat
[0:27:04] <%honeyman18> Thanks did it best
[0:27:07] <%vixenpunch> @AngriestPat will you be creating a league of legends club for subs? You can show off your club tag next to your name
[0:27:09] <Nina96> wow
[0:27:11] <%TheActuallyGuy> TheActuallyGuy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! wow. 6 months already. its been a bit since I could tune in so maybe I missed it, but are we gonna get more Fallen Order?
[0:27:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This is it. This is how Pat's Twitch career dies.
[0:27:12] <@commanderclaw> They rip off a ton of shit
[0:27:14] <%Fenrirlives> okay poor people
[0:27:14] <%driemen> turkleton
[0:27:18] <%Truunbeaten> Holy shit did I get here early for once!?
[0:27:20] <%Bailey__gaming> it makes me laugh how they get away with ripping off dances
[0:27:20] <%vixenpunch> You don’t have to friend the people who ask for an invite
[0:27:22] <%bevyrage> @AngriestPat looking it up and turns out there's not only no streamer mode, but you have to manually block people sending friend requests. streamers also get sniped and ghosted real frequently too. riot doesn't really have much support for their streamers apparently.
[0:27:23] <%SashaStarshine> what's happening to Dora?
[0:27:23] <+azure22900> Fortnight ripped off all the dances
[0:27:30] <AMaidIndeed> Donald Faison
[0:27:31] <+lethallunacyx> He did not invent that
[0:27:32] <%blankwaffle> fortnite ripped a ton of dances
[0:27:37] <+DesertPenguin> Fortnite even stole respawn beacons from Apex Legends
[0:27:38] <critfumble_> they love to steal dances ESPECIALLY from black hiphop culture
[0:27:39] <%sirisvirus> They stole pretty much every dance from pop culture
[0:27:40] <%Ranryu692> you can copyright anything
[0:27:45] <shiny_prinny> how did that lawsuit work out?
[0:27:48] <%logoth_> The future refused to change
[0:27:48] <+DesertPenguin> They stole respawn beacons from apex legends
[0:27:53] <Marpolo13> nailed it
[0:27:54] <Nina96> Iam surprised they never got in trouble for taking all those ideas from apex
[0:28:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:28:01] <%dekkitout> GOTEEM
[0:28:02] <%vixenpunch> If you danced next to a boss in league of legends it would do the carlton
[0:28:04] <+DesertPenguin> what other ideas did they take
[0:28:09] <redrins> the other one
[0:28:10] <zipfile777> LUL
[0:28:12] <%sirisvirus> chewbacca kardashien
[0:28:20] <valriot> Kunt Kardashian
[0:28:25] <%Ranryu692> Trump tried to copyright "you're fired"
[0:28:26] <%Bailey__gaming> Tiddy & Booty is a detective show id watch
[0:28:31] <critfumble_> yeah no way that holds up lol
[0:28:32] <+DesertPenguin> music copyright is even worse
[0:28:33] <Tarviti> They lost the lawsuits because for dance you can only dance routines and not short sections or single moves
[0:28:34] <+Mr_Pylon> Also kimono iirc
[0:28:35] <%Keaton_x> Didn't Carlton steal that dance from Courtney Cox or some shit?
[0:28:35] <Nina96> fuck off copy righting words
[0:28:35] <%honeyman18> the one with the fat ass that kills men's souls
[0:28:41] <+azure22900> Kardashiens trying to steal Kimono from Japan
[0:28:47] <linklol321> cant wait for pat to start playing fortnite so he can completely lose his mind
[0:28:48] <%bevyrage> @Bailey__gaming that's a good idea
[0:28:52] <%yet_another_brony> hey no pressure but you didnt read my sub message
[0:28:53] <+DesertPenguin> Outer Worlds is much fun but yea you can play it like a shooter
[0:28:55] <%bevyrage> also that's a sick shirt pat

[0:32:07] <bigbrothergannon> snom is the retarded kinda cute
[0:32:08] <+BIumen> Do you know about Teamfight Tactics or like are you just going for normal League
[0:32:09] <@ShockzNDrawe> eh it's not crazy but we akk know you'll drop it after you lose interest
[0:32:12] <redrins> he spent so much money on stream on hots, it's not that unexcpected
[0:32:14] <%driemen> Because you're super wrong
[0:32:16] <Cycrosa> as a game its okay
[0:32:17] <%driemen> super duper wrong
[0:32:18] <%JonaFett69> league is good the players can be pretty bad though
[0:32:19] <Marpolo13> nailed it
[0:32:20] <%dekkitout> Yes
[0:32:20] <%SashaStarshine> League has a much steeper barrier for entry than HOTS does
[0:32:21] <Picia000123> yes
[0:32:24] <The_Hand> the ppl telling you to not play league or that league is bad are getting pretty annoying tbh
[0:32:25] <Flare3500> hots is for babies
[0:32:27] <Cycrosa> the people in it fucking suck tho
[0:32:31] <%MelBrooksKA> Probably all three
[0:32:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MOBAS are cancerr IMO
[0:32:32] <%connos_procrastination> futnut
[0:32:35] <Picia000123> Pat did play Fortnite

[0:32:54] <%connos_procrastination> mobers make my peepee soft
[0:32:56] <%MaddyCaddy> The thing with League is that your enjoyment can spiral out of control due to someone else.
[0:32:57] <%dekkitout> You also beat the CoD br first try
[0:32:58] <Picia000123> OOOOOFF
[0:32:58] <%Finaldragoon> DotA 2 just had a massive update, play that instead for toxic manchildren
[0:32:59] <%JonaFett69> YOU MISSED THE EVNTS
[0:33:01] <critfumble_> dota just became fucking crazy like yesterday
[0:33:02] <Imsoverylazy> League is fun if you and you're tam are winning, but if somebody feeds it becomes a test of willpower
[0:33:02] <+Zxtole> Some of the first betas were in 2009
[0:33:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> when are you going to stream Evil Zone?
[0:33:04] <%MaddyCaddy> So that's why I think it's not great
[0:33:04] <%JonaFett69> FREE STUFF
[0:33:04] <Flare3500> you get 8 grand on the twitch bounty
[0:33:05] <jetvillain> Play League on stream
[0:33:06] <%Roflmag> Pat needs like a league coach
[0:33:08] <+lethallunacyx> I hate it and I'm bad at it

[0:33:11] <+Zrams3y> god damn pat is /old/
[0:33:13] <+Ominnous> 10 year anniversary, but the new kid on the block
[0:33:14] <Picia000123> League is older than my cousin :P
[0:33:22] <shiny_prinny> it's ok, apparently league looked like a browser virus at the start
[0:33:23] <Saiyza> League used to give us apologems. Long, LONG ago.
[0:33:24] <%Roflmag> Maybe get someone like Voyboy to help him out
[0:33:25] <%crimsonharvest> Whatup, scrotelords
[0:33:26] <markuskydd> play teamfight tactics
[0:33:28] <critfumble_> DUNDUN
[0:33:30] <simifu> yup can't surrender if someone leaves when the game already started TriHard
[0:33:32] <@ShockzNDrawe> Hi Paige
[0:33:40] <%Truunbeaten> Cheer1000 hey Pat I introduced, in name, to a series called Kingdom Under Fire last week. This week I’ll give a short explanation of their genre. It is a weird but awesome medieval action/RTS hybrid game where you choose troops to send on to a battlefield, you control these troops from both third person and an overhead map and when your commanders troop goes into battle it turns into a third person hack and slash.
[0:33:40] <%greatbalwaagh> Hey everybody!
[0:33:44] <%dekkitout> Lawler Order
[0:33:44] <%cureneckbeard> big racism.
[0:33:44] <%honeyman18> Dick Wolf
[0:33:45] <Imsoverylazy> Play ARAM on stream
[0:33:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Imagine choosing League over Fallen Order NotLikeThis

[0:33:54] <+Ominnous> time to move
[0:33:55] <j64mind> pat is not just old, pat is dumb bitch energy
[0:33:56] <%BlitzNeidhart> Big words from a man who mixes up Wilds/Worlds
[0:33:57] <Personified134> I won't be here for the league stream so here's some HOT GAMER TIPS: Your wards refresh often, use them regularly; not dying is more important than killing dudes; getting minion kills is VERY important, do your best to practice getting the last hit on them @AngriestPat
[0:33:59] <%Aztec50> you can remake the game if someone doesnt connect
[0:33:59] <Flare3500> Play league more then
[0:34:00] <%JonaFett69> giv epat the monies
[0:34:01] <Daxalog> Northernlion gets them dosnt he? Hes in Canada
[0:34:04] <%StaceMcGate> Pat is the littlest of the little guys
[0:34:04] <The_Hand> if pat wants to play it let him play it and see if he enjoys it or not lol. dont be toxic about him playing it then complain that league is toxic lol
[0:34:10] <%Ranryu692> spite is the best motivator
[0:34:10] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Really? I swear Liam has talked about getting some
[0:34:13] <%Alpha8087> LOL
[0:34:16] <lautalocos> what level are you at league?
[0:34:16] <@ShockzNDrawe> Pat why must you be so spiteful
[0:34:16] <%greatbalwaagh> Yeah
[0:34:17] <Personified134> honestly i've played 2000 hours of league and most of them were out of spite
[0:34:19] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Screw League. Play FF Tactics.

[0:35:18] <@ShockzNDrawe> "OH MY GOD WHY DO YOU WANT TO PLAY LEAGUE UGH BTW PLAY LEAUGE PLZ NOW"
[0:35:20] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I legit am only here for Outer Worlds and will probably tune out for League
[0:35:27] <%imadoc91> League is actual trash though honestly. Fun trash, but trash
[0:35:28] <lautalocos> hey guys, AngriestPat here! welcome to me "how to get out of bronce" tutorial! dont forget to smash that like button!
[0:35:39] <%dekkitout> There's Dia Del Los Muertos Monster?
[0:35:40] <%connos_procrastination> @AngriestPat its the wierd mango monster is v gud
[0:35:42] <%BlitzNeidhart> I'm just here for league
[0:35:43] <+BIumen> at least esports league is better than ow esports :)
[0:35:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> that means it sucks

[0:35:50] <%Roflmag> Iron IV Pat here we come
[0:35:50] <The_Hand> so how is outer worlds ending looking pat? @AngriestPat
[0:35:51] <critfumble_> @ShockzNDrawe that sounds about right for peoples relationship with league
[0:35:51] <+Zrams3y> Pat saying he will play league has sparked a hockey riot in the stream over the idea we would have to watch a league streamer
[0:35:52] <%crimsonharvest> Shitty Brutal Legend
[0:35:55] <+Cavumentum> Is League of Legends just Fate for people who are in denial of liking anime
[0:35:56] <bluebiscuit94> Oh is this another EU friendly week? Nice
[0:36:02] <Marpolo13> "stable"
[0:36:02] <jetvillain> Pat gonna stream LoL?

[0:36:19] <%Takreth> Outer Woirlds
[0:36:20] <%Sephirios> woho League!
[0:36:21] <%BlitzNeidhart> Where's league?
[0:36:22] <waifoong98> ewww talk more play less Kappa
[0:36:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Choosing to play League is insane
[0:36:24] <%Ranryu692> oh jeez this is kinda loud
[0:36:24] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yay! Outer Worlds.
[0:36:26] <+Elky3> this isn't League moon2A
[0:36:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> aw nertz, it's this guy again
[0:36:30] <linklol321> league of legends is looking really different from what i remember
[0:36:33] <%imadoc91> League bad, Outer Worlds good.
[0:36:36] <Nina96> FUCK FATE
[0:36:37] <mr_gunn> Outer worlds is over? I remember when this game first dropped
[0:36:37] <%connos_procrastination> time to hang out with cheese girl and vicar maxamillian
[0:36:38] <%cureneckbeard> PADORU PADORU
[0:36:40] <%honeyman18> This game is pretty good
[0:36:41] <$ItsRatman> Outer Wilds you mean
[0:36:47] <+NitronStreams> UMU
[0:36:49] <+Ominnous> Ye it be like that some times
[0:36:51] <%connos_procrastination> anime fans are a mistake
[0:36:52] <%dekkitout> A what?
[0:36:52] <%miguelrod777> DOUKDA
[0:36:55] <Marpolo13> except don't watch that one
[0:36:59] <@ShockzNDrawe> Pat why\
[0:37:00] <+Kingtut9009> @AngriestPat As someone who plays league, don't play league, that game is trash
[0:37:01] <%Lizard0TM> PADORU
[0:37:04] <%dalmek> the difference is LoL is toxic in game, while FATE is toxic IRL
[0:37:05] <The_Hand> no not that one
[0:37:05] <ECRead> PADORU PADORUUUU
[0:37:06] <%BlitzNeidhart> Watch this one, not that one!
[0:37:10] <%Roflmag> Guess you just have to play league instead
[0:37:10] <HarraceHarrison> League players WISH they had dick sucking beanie babies
[0:37:11] <%BlitzNeidhart> UMU
[0:37:12] <valriot> DONT YOU SHIT TALK ASTOLFO
[0:37:12] <Nina96> elmo ate them
[0:37:15] <Imsoverylazy> There are worse fandoms than Fate. Warhammer for instance
[0:37:15] <%cureneckbeard> big stumb
[0:37:19] <$Mothman742> FATE was a mistake
[0:37:19] <%ChaosAethr> Did elmo Eat it?
[0:37:20] <%boxofhooligans> Did you guys know their is a 12 min speedrun of this? I am almost sure it was legit. I skimmed it at work lol.
[0:37:20] <%dekkitout> Fate fans are the anime equivalent of The Wire Fans

[0:37:34] <Nina96> FATE was the biggest mistake
[0:37:37] <%skizzuto> Pat longs for his cyborg parts
[0:37:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @AngriestPat Honeslty Pat the original Fate before the fanservice shit came along is really good. Its a dark and seroius story
[0:37:39] <%MightyMaxT> RoboPat
[0:37:40] <%connos_procrastination> apatHoldon
[0:37:42] <@Pandora_Prime> Streamer gold.
[0:37:45] <%linkster291> Welp, stream canceled
[0:37:46] <+lethallunacyx> She's right, don't trust her
[0:37:47] <@ShockzNDrawe> Pat wants his metal parts
[0:37:49] <%Sephirios> Broken cyborg Pat lost his metal parts?
[0:37:51] <%imadoc91> The best way to experience Fate is to watch Zero and then GTFO, fight me.
[0:37:51] <Marpolo13> @Imsoverylazy are they? i don't really know about warhammer fans but fate fans are pretty bad
[0:37:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> the only good Fate is Blade Works and you all can suck a dick and die in a bathroom if you disagree. stay night sucked and zero was boring.
[0:37:58] <$ItsRatman> That was fun, see you guys next stream
[0:38:07] <%Bailey__gaming> PARTS AT RISK
[0:38:09] <%BlitzNeidhart> @BallerSwagBro9k Fate was always trash, don't @ me

[0:38:23] <Imsoverylazy> @BallerSwagBro9k Fate was always fanservice though. Literally right from the beginning.

[0:38:27] <%Doruben> the cleaning people?
[0:38:28] <%Fenrirlives> Pat continues to fuel our Fate shit posting with his anger, and thus becomes more angry. THE CYCLE IS UNBREAKABLE
[0:38:36] <%cureneckbeard> She can read your thoughts like in that Star Trek episode
[0:38:36] <%boxofhooligans> atpHorns apatSkelmo atpHorns

[0:38:58] <ALazo> @rumtumtugnutz I was extremely confused until I realized you were talking anime and not vn
[0:39:06] <$Mothman742> "THIS" time
[0:39:06] <OldManDeckardCain> is your heart lazing Kappa
[0:39:07] <+lethallunacyx> same
[0:39:07] <Nina96> @AngriestPat are u still unpacking
[0:39:07] <CrimKangaroo> woooooo, catchin streams live!
[0:39:08] <%imadoc91> Pat should watch the old Fate anime and then write off the rest of the series to piss people off more.
[0:39:09] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> After a cumhazzard blows in.
[0:39:10] <%Ranryu692> Don't apologize for creating jobs
[0:39:13] <%Soulbishop> Wild sex parties like Stewie?
[0:39:20] <%Tenkay> @imadoc91 Do you mean like Woolie did
[0:39:21] <+MisterCrimson> Even the House is too big for Pat's legs
[0:39:27] <%Nordguy> i cannot believe Patrick and Paige are part of the Bougeousie
[0:39:32] <@ShockzNDrawe> You fate people are unreal
[0:39:37] <+firmlygraspi1> get 20% off your Metal Parts with the code BOIVIN2020
[0:39:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> @alazo why would I play a video game I have to read? :p
[0:39:42] <%Tenkay> Imagine liking Fate right Shockz
[0:39:47] <%boxofhooligans> @angriestpat do you know of the 12 min speed rum of TOW? half of it was just in edgewater.
[0:39:47] <Saiyza> I thought Pat would be OCD clean. But I guess it's more "I don't wanna flatten amazon boxes"
[0:39:49] <%Soulbishop> Last I checked Pat committed insurance fraud
[0:39:53] <Marpolo13> @imadoc91 it's kinda frustrating that the "highest rated" ones are just trash but looks visually great so they over praised
[0:39:54] <@ShockzNDrawe> what kind of asshole would like fate
[0:39:56] <%dalmek> Metal Parts Chaos, XD
[0:39:57] <Imsoverylazy> Fate is just a worse Record of Ragnarok, change my mind
[0:39:58] <%Bailey__gaming> @peachsaliva are you typing to me? where! :) or a diff bailey?
[0:40:07] <%BlitzNeidhart> @Nordguy Being able to spell bougie correctly is a suspect as fuck comrade
[0:40:11] <$Mothman742> @angriestpat did u do the sprat side mission?
[0:40:16] <%NeoCre> Meep
[0:40:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Job update:I didn't get the job...Yet... So apparently the budget was too large for a single job...so they are concidering multiple people! I hope that means I get the job
[0:40:28] <%dekkitout> 1 whole quest
[0:40:29] <ALazo> @rumtumtugnutz there’s no video game there if we’re being honest, just reading
[0:40:31] <%Ranryu692> @BlitzNeidhart he misspelled it, though
[0:40:41] <+firmlygraspi1> this dude's armor is so cool
[0:40:41] <mrblack499> stealing time
[0:40:48] <%Nordguy> @blitzneidhart i got fat fingers and a small phone brother
[0:40:54] <Ipsenscastle> deblibbery?
[0:41:00] <%imadoc91> @Marpolo13 I actually like Zero the most even though UBW looks better. It's just better written and well executed.
[0:41:02] <Daxalog> I like how in the speedrun he never gets the lock off the ship door and just enters from the side
[0:41:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> @alazo I forgot Fate was a sex game tbh
[0:41:07] <%cureneckbeard> Pat if you lost your legs in an accident but could get robot legs, would you get Pat-sized legs or tall legs
[0:41:08] <%imadoc91> UBW is meh
[0:41:13] <%dalmek> say the line Pat
[0:41:22] <Ipsenscastle> OUCH MYLEGSMAN
[0:41:23] <%linkster291> Pat, has become a Mule. Stealing peoples packages just to get likes.
[0:41:23] <%Soulbishop> Did someone put together that super cut yet? Ahhh my legs
[0:41:30] <%Razputin217> Bitch ain't got no legs

[0:41:41] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Why are you picking his ass?
[0:41:43] <%bevyrage> i imagine pat would get telescopic legs
[0:41:43] <Marpolo13> @imadoc91 i 100% agree. zero has some derp moments (but what doesnt) but is way better written. UBW just has some nicer looking fights
[0:41:43] <%Bailey__gaming> Bless you Paige
[0:41:46] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Paige does the cute sneeze
[0:41:48] <dukenux> thats an anime girl sneeze

[0:42:05] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, you already grabbed an ID from the drunk guy
[0:42:09] <%Truunbeaten> Cheer100 Cheer100 The fact that i made the series sound like Brutal Legend in anyway just tells me I did a shit job of describing the game. But I don’t want to sound like I’m trying forcing my opinion on you so I’ll just leave it at that.

[1:09:48] <+Javaa01> System Shock 1 ain't really stream material

[1:15:33] <%marsanta> No they melted internally, quickly
[1:15:34] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Not quick enough.
[1:15:34] <%MakotoPB> don't they turn into protein goo?
[1:15:35] <%dalmek> wasn't it explosive cell liquifaction or something?
[1:15:40] <%derap41> 90% of those people would have died anyway since they can't revive them
[1:15:41] <%ArchimerDreatect> Drownign quickly is never quick enough
[1:15:43] <%MaddyCaddy> Aren't they supposed to melt according to Phineas?
[1:15:44] <beetbo2> thats why drowning sucks
[1:15:47] <%linkster291> It's not a nice death.
[1:15:48] <mrblack499> there not real people so it's ok
[1:15:48] <@Pandora_Prime> they specifically said the word "Excrutiating"
[1:15:49] <+Cavumentum> @Ethel9727 #PatDidNothingWrong
[1:15:50] <Cycrosa> basically they turned into lcl
[1:15:54] <%MaddyCaddy> So you melted like ever single person
[1:15:55] <%deviljhojho_> nice voice
[1:16:00] <%honeyman18> Can they drown in Liquid Oxygen?
[1:16:01] <Imsoverylazy> So in essence, Pat just Euthanised scores of his peers?
[1:16:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> No pat they asphyxiated in a dilated perception of time
[1:16:05] <%linkster291> The real big bad.

[1:19:06] <koolaid_kevster> only 1 ending though?
[1:19:07] <%AncelDeLambert> he's inconvenient
[1:19:09] <Run44forrest> wtf bad end?
[1:19:11] <@ShockzNDrawe> Phineas and Ferb?
[1:19:14] <@ShockzNDrawe> funny joke ha ha
[1:19:24] <moosemonkey397> did pat kill all of th experimentsm or just some of them for the chemiclas?
[1:19:30] <Ethel9727> All of them
[1:19:33] <moosemonkey397> nice
[1:19:38] <Lozzu> Hey Pat, been a fan since I was in7th grade in the machinima days, now I'm in college. Now, in order to like league of legends, you must first hate league of legends. this is from someone who has played league of legends for 5 years now. The best way to play the game, in my opinion, is to have a 5 man group who is all coordinated and willing to work things out with each other.
[1:19:41] <+GirthyRaph> League waiting room
[1:19:42] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> How will more mouths to feed help?
[1:20:00] <%MaddyCaddy> The Hope has a shit load of Scientist and Engineers
[1:20:09] <Lozzu> whoops meant that to be a bits thing
[1:20:26] <+LTKonnor> Thank you Lozzu, very cool
[1:20:28] <%StaceMcGate> And more importantly, the people on the The Hope are not corporate stooges
[1:20:30] <bakkatohri> The only reason anybody sticks with League for a long time is out of spite. uwu
[1:20:31] <Marpolo13> how does reviving them help anyway
[1:20:38] <rcand9> fingers crossed for dumb joke ending its great
[1:20:45] <+vijil58> Wait Pat plays league???
[1:20:53] <%Seraphile> uhhh phineas... pot...kettle black
[1:20:57] <rossnwolf> @Marpolo13 The Hope is filled to brim with scientists from earth
[1:20:58] <SparkAfterDark> methinks he doth protest
[1:21:05] <%Alpha8087> Delicious chemicals
[1:21:06] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> mmmmmm, yummmy chemicals
[1:21:07] <@ShockzNDrawe> Love is just chemicals remember

[1:21:50] <+GirthyRaph> i hope pat mains veigar
[1:21:57] <%derap41> That should be self evident by now
[1:21:57] <Marpolo13> i wanna be frozen today
[1:21:58] <%Alpha8087> We gotta get the megaseeds Morty
[1:22:02] <Imsoverylazy> I just realised. This whole game is a sequel to Phineas and Ferb
[1:22:08] <%ItsRatman> Time to be a super big terrorrist?
[1:22:12] <SparkAfterDark> If only the one scientist that knew how to do exactly this thing didn't abandon them and take all his research
[1:22:24] <%derap41> Why not
[1:22:29] <+vijil58> Nah pat mains gnar bruh lol

[1:22:32] <+Cavumentum> THE FIRST AGAINST THE WALL
[1:22:33] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> What's wrong with shooting all of the board?
[1:22:38] <+HelloImTom08> sofieShrug
[1:22:43] <%honeyman18> Eat the Rich is surprisingly valid here
[1:22:45] <%derap41> 100 000 extra mouths on a planet that is starving
[1:22:57] <The_Hand> why would they freeze everyone instead of killing them all?
[1:23:01] <%Seraphile> isn't eat the rich always valid
[1:23:02] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Engwithan_Elder_God skulls are too thick, can't penetrate
[1:23:07] <The_Hand> seems like a waste of time,
[1:23:15] <SparkAfterDark> @The_Hand Because killing people is wrong
[1:23:19] <%derap41> Yeah send it into the sun
[1:23:32] <%Alpha8087> BIG BRAIN
[1:23:34] <tigerfang86> Smrt
[1:23:43] <moosemonkey397> send it into the sun is only available if you have dumb dialog otions
[1:23:44] <The_Hand> no im talking about the board freezing everyone. @SparkAfterDark
[1:23:51] <Ethel9727> @The_Hand Because freezing them means you have free labor when you need it, and only when you need it.
[1:23:51] <%MightyMaxT> @The_Hand They're killing the poor, they're freezing the rich
[1:23:55] <%derap41> @moosemonkey397 dangit
[1:23:58] <The_Hand> ohhhhhhhhh
[1:24:01] <rcand9> ah he's big smart? damn no dumb ending then
[1:24:05] <tigerfang86> Thanks SAM
[1:24:07] <%wannabemoogle> We're wicked smaht
[1:24:10] <+HelloImTom08> reasonable sanity is overrated
[1:24:14] <Koosahmii> Unreliable Hope....OMG
[1:24:17] <BoneofMalkav> Then you can call the ship The Unreliable Hope
[1:24:19] <%Razputin217> Thanks SAM
[1:24:20] <SparkAfterDark> @The_Hand Killing them would be wrong. freezing them is not killing them therefore not wrong.
[1:24:43] <Paperware> I wish SAM interjected in dialogue more often
[1:25:04] <The_Hand> why would corporate care what is right/wrong
[1:25:15] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> catch lightning in a bottle a second time
[1:25:15] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It's fine.
[1:25:17] <+HelloImTom08> ITS FIIINE

[1:26:34] <+GirthyRaph> save them from skyrim
[1:26:34] <SparkAfterDark> I mean to be fair, you managed to solve a lot of shit really fast. And supposedly everyone on the hope is just as good as you. It's literally a freezer full of Player Characters
[1:26:35] <kvassimoto> hee haw big lies
[1:26:35] <%Alpha8087> Pimp Pat will save the outer worlds
[1:26:36] <Marpolo13> lie cheat and steal?
[1:26:38] <%AncelDeLambert> @angriestpat btw Phineas here says you totally should have sold him out, because he set traps
[1:26:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> all this falls apart with the knowledge of hydrophonics
[1:26:41] <%MaddyCaddy> There was supposed to be an option about tricking the Adjutant, but I guess you told her to fuck off to hard
[1:26:43] <%cureneckbeard> big number
[1:26:46] <bakkatohri> Pat has now become the liar. Next he must steal the pies.
[1:26:47] <+Elky3> Lie some more rooPog
[1:26:53] <mayorrev> I forgot about moon gang
[1:27:02] <beetbo2> ??
[1:27:07] <%marsanta> Talk to him again
[1:27:08] <%Razputin217> Now YOU are Todd Howard
[1:27:12] <@Pandora_Prime> @AngriestPat Do yourself a huge favor and get a lightning gun of some kind.
[1:27:15] <%honeyman18> if you tell him about it
[1:27:15] <%dalmek> if you accept the thing from Akande, and then tell Phineas, he goes "oh yeah I'll be ready don't worry"
[1:27:16] <%AbnormalVoid> he only says that if you pretend to agreee to her plan
[1:27:16] <%MaddyCaddy> I'm pretty sure he missed it
[1:27:21] <+DesertPenguin> !uptime
[1:27:22] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 27m.
[1:27:23] <%GarbageNirvana> If you mention the offer you were given by what's her face
[1:27:23] <+Dustwalker44> When did he get that hat?!? AND WHERE?!?
[1:27:23] <rcand9> talking gibberish
[1:27:23] <+Ominnous> He didn't say that cause you didn't take the deal, you told that lady to fuck off @AngriestPat
[1:27:25] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> He means you can pretend to go along with commander lady
[1:27:27] <%aishman> @AngriestPat When you were talking to the chick, rather than hang up with her, if you let her talk she wants you to put a tracker on Phineas
[1:27:27] <+subdude_> If you listened to that lady's offer you can tell Phineas and he'll tell you to go through with it.
[1:27:29] <+KaiSnow> He says you should've corrupted the signal and sent them late, when he has set traps
[1:27:30] <%marsanta> Weird
[1:27:38] <%marsanta> Oh
[1:27:54] <%AncelDeLambert> Phineas says "Yeah, tell them I'm here, I'll get ready for them"
[1:27:54] <%MaddyCaddy> It would have just been extra XP
[1:28:00] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat Kreia would be disappointed in you, Pat
[1:28:07] <%derap41> Did you get his special gun?
[1:28:20] <%derap41> Or is that later?
[1:28:24] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:28:24] <Paperware> Later
[1:28:25] <%dalmek> later
[1:28:28] <rcand9> lightning gun ia pretty good after tinkering
[1:28:28] <%derap41> Tinker that space gun

[1:28:45] <%Razputin217> not enough parts
[1:29:09] <%derap41> You're gonna want a purple gun
[1:29:11] <+ClaudeMcGarren> not enough huh?
[1:29:12] <@ShockzNDrawe> @AngriestPat so in this game does the big number actually matter unlike in destiny 2?
[1:29:28] <BoneofMalkav> Lightning Acid Gun
[1:29:36] <%honeyman18> Finally finished my casserole, back to watching Pat save the colony.

[1:31:12] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> just don't mess up
[1:31:12] <%dalmek> @AngriestPat there is a Dumb dialogue option to skip the ship directly into the Sun. It ends the game

[1:36:31] <Marpolo13> random
[1:36:53] <rossnwolf> The Hope's Logs are my favorite part of this game
[1:36:58] <%Seraphile> crazy talk
[1:37:02] <%AncelDeLambert> the ballad of the lonely janitor is a hoot, msn
[1:37:02] <%dalmek> there's a LOT of logs on the ship
[1:37:06] <rcand9> hope pretty grim
[1:37:06] <%Seraphile> hopes logs depressed me
[1:37:43] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> You have a ship full of perfectly-preserved human bodies, you can never *really* run out of food.
[1:37:58] <rcand9> do much food guys
[1:38:01] <%alphonseisbest> the hope logs are soooo good!
[1:38:02] <42nfl19> Wait, if @angriestpat skips the ship now won't he be bringing soldiers to the scientist?
[1:38:04] <rcand9> so*
[1:38:12] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> just eat the other passengers
[1:38:16] <@commanderclaw> No pat, the food on the ship
[1:38:17] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> it'll be fine
[1:38:41] <%Seraphile> @cereal_box_conspiracy isnt one of the logs a calculation of how many they would have to eat before they reach halcyon and its a pretty gruesome number
[1:38:42] <%dalmek> chat, in case you forgot, at some point frozen colonists just melt on removal. So the food WILL run out
[1:38:53] <%AncelDeLambert> no, Pat, they fell out of FTL
[1:38:59] <%alphonseisbest> you'll see pat
[1:39:01] <beetbo2> did ellie just blow your cover??
[1:39:03] <%marsanta> It had an accident and fell out of FTL early
[1:39:07] <Run44forrest> forbidden space casket juice
[1:39:08] <+MSpellBringer> they did have enough food but their ftl drive broke
[1:39:08] <Marpolo13> MrDestructoid i see through your lies
[1:39:11] <%honeyman18> They got off course and had to finish at normal speeds, never planned for it.
[1:39:11] <Delenay> the disguise lasts only so long
[1:39:12] <%linkster291> No pat they had enough food, just the trip didn't go as planned.
[1:39:12] <+Dives__> Easy. Eat the colonists
[1:39:13] <rcand9> poor mech just wanted to taser you

[1:42:36] <%alphonseisbest> Well pat u did want the toxic right?
[1:42:43] <+Javaa01> Problem with Leagues toxicity nowadays is just that it's all weaksauce passive aggression

[1:42:58] <HarraceHarrison> Theres logs in the opposite rooms, be sure to check those out
[1:43:01] <%marsanta> Pat ignoring all story lore so he can end the game quick :P

[1:43:27] <bakkatohri> Play Yasuo, go support.
[1:43:39] <%aishman> @AngriestPat If you go around the ship and find the other computers, you get the full story.
[1:43:42] <rcand9> many logs on each side of the bridges bedrooms
[1:43:44] <%alphonseisbest> kinda
[1:43:48] <allanmiri> Give Pat a break, we all get a little impatient at the finish line.
[1:43:49] <+subdude_> Cannibalism
[1:43:50] <%alphonseisbest> yup
[1:43:51] <@commanderclaw> Yeah
[1:43:56] <%honeyman18> Ate peeps
[1:43:59] <%marsanta> And then someone had the idea that there was a LOT of frozen food on board
[1:44:00] <waifoong98> CANNIBALISM, but the cryo peeps turn into MUSH LUL
[1:44:00] <mrblack499> yep
[1:44:00] <%dalmek> directed the ship in sub-FTL speeds, and starved
[1:44:04] <%marsanta> If you're not picky
[1:44:04] <rcand9> yummy colonists
[1:44:07] <sirrice77> fell outta FTL, no food, civil war, cannibalism, they all died
[1:44:10] <%dalmek> ate people. but then the frozen people started melting

[1:44:17] <%arsonistdaria> ADA is best girl
[1:44:18] <%aishman> @AngriestPat They went off course, ran out of the food, some of them turned to cannibalism of the colonists, also no matter what they tried, none of their veggies could grow
[1:44:25] <rossnwolf> The crew got split between eating people and not But when the cannibals took people out of hibernation they suffered the explosive cell death that Wells talked about so they all also starved

[1:52:43] <Imsoverylazy> @Ixiah That is hardly a spoiler
[1:53:02] <%l3sovikk> Am I lagging or is the stream dropping frames?
[1:53:11] <%l3sovikk> Probably me.
[1:53:13] <tr00ly_> cum
[1:53:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> he killed THOUSANDS of collonists
[1:53:18] <Run44forrest> its you
[1:53:27] <rcand9> thats a lot of explosive soup
[1:53:28] <%StaceMcGate> He killed dozens* of colonists
[1:53:29] <filialpails> it's not like they were better off frozen
[1:53:45] <+Walopoh> Nobody thought it was profitable to wake up a ship full of potential employee-slaves?
[1:53:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> there is only 9999 left when you read this
[1:53:46] <mrblack499> 12 not thousands
[1:53:52] <%Razputin217> You were his only success
[1:53:52] <+HelloImTom08> if he did nothing they would still die
[1:53:59] <Imsoverylazy> Technically Phineas didn't kill anyone. It was the freezing that killed them
[1:54:16] <Run44forrest> FeelsBadMan
[1:54:20] <beetbo2> He tried
[1:54:22] <%Seraphile> check window, theres a note
[1:54:23] <beetbo2> at least he tried
[1:54:29] <%GarbageNirvana> At least he did something
[1:54:29] <Run44forrest> he tried his best
[1:54:32] <%StaceMcGate> the main issue is that he conducted human experimentation
[1:54:34] <rossnwolf> And that's why all of your starting jobs are remedial bullshit! He didn't know if the revival was actually going to work!
[1:54:39] <%honeyman18> I mean they were gonna die if they weren't saved so, meh?
[1:54:56] <mayorrev> good gun?
[1:55:00] <rcand9> no wonder the poor guys a little nuts so many people on his hands
[1:55:09] <@ShockzNDrawe> Pat your guy looks like such an asshole
[1:55:11] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Damn, the Steam Controller is on sale for $5 (+ shipping) right now. At that price, is it worth it?
[1:55:13] <Run44forrest> im okay with turning into goo if it means itll save the rest of you chat FeelsBadMan
[1:55:22] <%linkster291> Fucked if they do fucked if they don't. Better to try to fix them if possible.
[1:55:23] <mayorrev> Pat are you wearing a cowboy hat?
[1:55:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Diamond_Dynamo not really
[1:55:27] <wholewheat420> That gun was my end-game gun, once I upgraded it a bit. it slaps
[1:55:30] <%Alpha8087> QUick someone cut on Mass Destruction
[1:55:31] <%Ranryu692> we never go to Hephaestus :(
[1:55:33] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @Diamond_Dynamo why would you want that......
[1:55:35] <SparkAfterDark> Shame that N-Rays are pretty garbage
[1:55:35] <rcand9> tartarsauce is nice
[1:55:38] <+Double_Tap_That> @Run44forrest Only if you let us eat your body goo
[1:55:39] <+Dives__> It's where Taratus Sauce comes from
[1:55:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Save cuz its the point of no return
[1:55:47] <%SGrim> @Diamond_Dynamo if only for the novelty. It's not a functional controller
[1:55:51] <%linkster291> @AngriestPat Hopefully the fixed the door crash bug for tarturus.
[1:55:52] <mayorrev> yeehaw
[1:55:58] <%derap41> max that gun you'll need it
[1:55:59] <+HelloImTom08> we are approaching the End Game

[2:03:51] <ovan20> JUST WALK BY THEWAR rooH
[2:03:53] <SparkAfterDark> It's kind of really stupid that the big fight happens even if you get the biometric ID
[2:03:54] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> SAM confirmed psychopath.
[2:03:55] <morow1ec> The fact that you can't choose to have backup or not is stupid.
[2:04:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SAM is PAT so hard it hurts
[2:04:09] <+subdude_> It's really easy to just walk through this whole level.
[2:04:10] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> This is the most gamery area in the whole game.
[2:04:11] <SparkAfterDark> But they HAD to have their hoover dam scene and it can only play out the one way
[2:04:14] <Marpolo13> @morow1ec that's obvious writing for you

[2:05:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is how white hats work people
[2:05:31] <%derap41> This game's ending is a bit of a wet fart
[2:05:33] <%honeyman18> What does loot matter at the last level?
[2:05:37] <+NitronStreams> Look at these goons all doing their jobs
[2:05:40] <%AncelDeLambert> Order of the Stick lampooned that perfectly
[2:05:41] <mrblack499> take lift
[2:05:42] <%Ranryu692> on top of those containers
[2:05:46] <%Alpha8087> Pat would finally be a robot, have robot legs, and shoot hand sanitizer and/or monster energy drink
[2:05:47] <+Dives__> upper level
[2:05:48] <%Ranryu692> left side of the map
[2:05:48] <%Soulbishop> Its not the only ending
[2:05:50] <bogan1998> go up to where you came down from
[2:05:54] <+Cavumentum> The truest form of Pat, a robot that can burn away everything to make things as clean as the moon, which he makes all of his companions wear
[2:05:55] <+Dives__> Up up up
[2:06:05] <%Soulbishop> Speed Run ending is way mor satisfying

[2:18:16] <Ethel9727> Nothing can stop pat as long as he has his drugs
[2:18:18] <Graxe_> You just need to meet the skill checks
[2:18:22] <TechDragon_Z> This was only a little bit tougher on Supernova to be honest.
[2:18:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IM FUCKING INVINCIBLE
[2:18:27] <beetbo2> you're functionally immortal with drugs
[2:18:27] <cascadepersona> Pat is enjoying his inhalants
[2:18:28] <%aishman> This is the most brute force way to handle this final boss
[2:18:30] <%WheatlyXT> damn

[2:18:31] <%Fyre_link> what a lame final boss

[2:18:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yep
[2:18:45] <%marsanta> If you went in the locked room before this you could have hacked it to turn it off
[2:18:45] <tigerfang86> yeah

[2:18:47] <%WheatlyXT> ???
[2:18:48] <%MaddyCaddy> There are

[2:18:52] <Marpolo13> yay ResidentSleeper
[2:18:54] <UncannyMatt> There were tons
[2:18:55] <%WheatlyXT> 1
[2:18:56] <%dalmek> you get dialogue checks if you say "We can talk about this" you dope
[2:18:56] <avocadosandwitch> you choose poorly
[2:18:58] <+HelloImTom08> there are tho

[2:18:59] <+ultimafullmetal> You didn't ask to talk is why
[2:19:00] <%miguelrod777> 1
[2:19:00] <%SwdVengeance> You skipped the dialouge checks by yelling at her
[2:19:00] <+Double_Tap_That> Because you chose the most aggressive options
[2:19:01] <%R3Roundabout> You chose not to negotiate
[2:19:02] <go4thekneez> you just didnt talk to her
[2:19:02] <TinSilver> went for a fight
[2:19:02] <%alphonseisbest> u missed them, other door

[2:19:03] <+TheUltrahumanoid> you didnt say lets talk about this
[2:19:03] <Owlboy7> @AngriestPat you have to be less rude and you get checks
[2:19:03] <%linkster291> You choose to egg her on.
[2:19:03] <+HelloImTom08> you chose wrong
[2:19:03] <%Finaldragoon> 1
[2:19:03] <@ShockzNDrawe> is it because you immedietly opend fire
[2:19:03] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat because you choose the path of violence in the conversation
[2:19:04] <Graxe_> Did you just talk about getting to the point?
[2:19:04] <Ralfclogs> anders6Dead
[2:19:06] <%coffeeabomination> Cause you chose the most violent things
[2:19:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @AngriestPat You can even skip the fightby hacking
[2:19:07] <%lotharrio> You didn't get dialogue checks because you killed the chairman and were way too hostile.
[2:19:09] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> that's because you fucked up the dialogue
[2:19:09] <%dalmek> fair

[2:26:03] <%SGrim> @Marpolo13 but Phineas not freezing the original colonists makes it a different thing. He was trying to undo a tragedy and failing. The board was purposefully freezing people to experiment on unfreezing them.
[2:26:04] <Graxe_> If you didn't kill Rockwell and convinced or threatened him to join you, you get the choice to puppet him instead.

[2:30:07] <%SGrim> @Marpolo13 they weren't doing the same thing. The board set people up to be experimented on, Phineas was unfreezing the people already doomed to die on the Hope due to the board's poor planning on the original colony formation.

[2:40:47] <Imsoverylazy> OK EVERYONE WE NEED TO TELL HIM TO PLAY IVERN
[2:40:48] <Marpolo13> @SGrim will do
[2:40:53] <+Jekado> "Mid or FEED"
[2:41:00] <Imsoverylazy> IVERN TOP OR FEED
[2:41:01] <redrins> open mid
[2:41:02] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> tell him to play a good game
[2:41:04] <bakkatohri> Getting to any rank past gold is almost impossible these days.
[2:41:06] <Tarviti> Ivern best boy
[2:41:08] <redrins> ff
[2:41:10] <%Tallie> god he has to play sion
[2:41:12] <bakkatohri> Like even smurfs will tell you this
[2:41:17] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> like Monster Girl Quest
[2:41:18] <astreas13> Oh dear.
[2:41:19] <%ShogunNoonto> this isb't dota
[2:41:20] <Imsoverylazy> Guys we gotta work together to get him to play someone
[2:41:21] <%Tallie> that champ is made for inting pat
[2:41:26] <%SoFarFetched> Just don't play Lee Sin or else his nudes will get leaked LUL
[2:41:32] <+IHATREID> pat should def main kled u guys
[2:41:34] <+smitty_werb_> Who has he been playing so far?
[2:41:38] <bakkatohri> Like you got people in diamond who can't get past gold, because there are just so many trolls and feeders
[2:41:38] <+IHATREID> literally him and paige
[2:41:38] <+Jekado> haven't played in a while do temoo still have the global taunt?
[2:41:39] <redrins> "darius might as well be afk, probably a bot"
[2:41:43] <Imsoverylazy> Yeah but Kled is fun, I wanna see him suffer
[2:41:45] <UnfilteredComic> Pat would like Mordekaiser
[2:41:50] <Imsoverylazy> Tell him to play Yasuo
[2:41:55] <+smitty_werb_> oh fuck yea morde
[2:42:00] <+smitty_werb_> 100%
[2:42:01] <+Jekado> does Ryse ult cause him to get a rework?
[2:42:03] <Tarviti> What role does he even play?
[2:42:04] <bakkatohri> Yasuo is the hardest easiest champ to play
[2:42:04] <Imsoverylazy> Sona
[2:42:05] <AllenDeadman> he'll just use garen... because garen is stupid good and there literally no reason not to use him
[2:42:06] <%Tallie> morde or sion
[2:42:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> did pat go to dump paint, piss, or ass? make your best now.
[2:42:06] <Monkroot> Has Pat said why he's gonna play League?
[2:42:15] <redrins> pat is probably only gonna play darius, he has only played a game and that was his choice
[2:42:17] <astreas13> Pat is a good guy he wouldn't play Yasuo. He has morals. A family.
[2:42:22] <Imsoverylazy> EVERYONE RECOMMEND AZIR
[2:42:23] <based_versauen> Guys your league boners are showing
[2:42:25] <Saiyza> Let's be real here, guys. Make Pat play Nasus; late game into oblivion?
[2:42:26] <lomack42> he should Aram to get a feel for as many different champs as possible
[2:42:26] <%SoFarFetched> jokes on you he's doing all three
[2:42:33] <+Woronov> Can somew1 explain the Fak? LoL?
[2:42:34] <bakkatohri> I'd play Sion more often if people didn't CC or use dashes to dodge everything
[2:42:39] <bakkatohri> Or Anivia wall my ult
[2:42:40] <+Jekado> if he plays lee sin is paige gonna post his nudes?
[2:42:44] <%Tallie> this is where he pulls out the fizz
[2:42:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Aram is fun
[2:42:49] <Monkroot> Who thinks Pats gonna drop it after today, or get hard addicted
[2:42:54] <UnfilteredComic> @Saiyza Pat does like the big numbers, but i feel like he would lose his shit if he missed stacks
[2:42:57] <Imsoverylazy> League is literally all dashes and dodging these days my dude @bakkatohri
[2:42:59] <+BIumen> Would Pat like TFT?
[2:43:00] <%vixenpunch> I cant wait
[2:43:09] <MessyBristles> it has loot boxes he will get addicted
[2:43:12] <+smitty_werb_> He might tbh
[2:43:13] <%vixenpunch> Im a nasus main with about 421k points
[2:43:14] <Imsoverylazy> He needs to play Azir
[2:43:15] <bakkatohri> Mobility creep OP
[2:43:16] <Saiyza> @UnfilteredComic He already needs to learn to cs, so it'll be fine or something.
[2:43:19] <%vixenpunch> I cry every time I miss stacks
[2:43:25] <zard9> league of WHAT
[2:43:27] <%Bailey__gaming> I return from the pee
