[0:07:01] <@Ranryu692> I actually used that copypasta and convinced someone to try FFXIV the night before they stopped selling the game LUL
[0:07:08] <%maskofmichael> Blueberries are only good in muffins
[0:07:09] <Blank9> blueberries are just low polygon count bunches of grapes
[0:07:12] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Hoping to survive the cringe this time around
[0:07:20] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @ranryu692 LUL oh my god
[0:07:20] <FluorescentLB> HEY EVERYONE, ff14 is **FREE** up to a certain level, FILL THE SERVERS MORE :D
[0:07:21] <%EynoStiles> That marketing promotion worked to well
[0:07:25] <@Ranryu692> I did warn them to wait and try Warframe instead because of the congestion
[0:07:25] <+Tucker0603> @patstaresat I play controller games with a new duke controller, is that crazy?
[0:07:29] <@tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Blank9! They have given 533 Gift Subs in the channel!

[0:07:38] <cartakus> Yup

[0:07:39] <%Blank9> thanks tizz
[0:07:45] <%cvp5127> nioh? more like pee oh
[0:07:54] <%valriot> Nioh 1 is less interesting and harder to get into
[0:07:55] <classypigeon234> Nioh 2 is way better than the first one
[0:07:55] <@tizz86> @blank9 np
[0:07:59] <+Mrbaconator> well it is
[0:08:03] <%MelfinaStarwind> psaGib nioh 2 tiem
[0:08:09] <+Dova573> tbf beating both niohs, I got sick of them as I beat them
[0:08:09] <+BlackSunEmperor> but you can

[0:08:12] <%EynoStiles> @cvp5127 more eew no

[0:08:15] <%kid_flashionable> kid_flashionable subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Almost two years! Thanks much for all the great streams, Pat--and good luck with all those gerblins! Appreciate all that you do!
[0:08:23] <+rafaelba93> at least some things will be better, dont know if everyrhing tho
[0:08:25] <@GeneralSCPatton> I certainly picked a hell of a time to sink $200 into all the primo editions of 14 stuff. That's my big mind goblin.
[0:08:25] <kuningaz45> Endwalker spoilers y/n?
[0:08:34] <%EynoStiles> unless
[0:08:35] <%TheAntiNihilist> lol. Nioh 2 is worse. I don't understand what everyone is saying
[0:08:37] <SaltyAzteca> Help ive been playing Disco Elysium for days straight and I can't put it down it's too good help NotLikeThis
[0:08:39] <+WildcardM> man one of my favorite things about nioh 2 is that I barely played nioh 1
[0:08:46] <%Blank9> I skipped smt nocturne for smt4 then somehow went back and liked soul hackers a lot
[0:08:47] <cartakus> ffxiv endwalker?
[0:08:50] <+Tucker0603> Tate Eboshi is the best waifu
[0:08:51] <+pectusumbra> Imagine telling people they had to play DMC2
[0:08:53] <%kujofire990> kujofire990 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 49 months! 4+ years now of watching this dysfunctional stream man and his dog, cat, and  fiancé. Thanks for the fun. Also
[0:08:54] <+Dova573> @TheAntiNihilist You are crazy
[0:08:56] <SilverFaustX> ff6 pixel out in 2 months
[0:08:57] <%maskofmichael> How can I play FF14 without playing FF1 though FF13?
[0:09:09] <DancesWitBalrog> just wiki dive 4Head
[0:09:09] <+Mrbaconator> go back and play TWO
[0:09:10] <%pokefan9956> only time that's necessary is when story REALLY matters
[0:09:20] <+Dova573> I mean its true
[0:09:23] <SaltyAzteca> YOU MUST PLAY 2. IT IS IMPORTANT Kappa
[0:09:23] <bob900000> I skipped 2
[0:09:24] <%dekkitout> Or go back and watch your lp/all the cutscenes...
[0:09:25] <%superc37> @theantinihilist you are legitimately insane
[0:09:26] <%Goatbait> Don't forget DMC:Devil may cry!
[0:09:27] <+Axellogic> Then theres that guy that got pissed off at DMCV
[0:09:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> Do what now?
[0:09:29] <scrumbotime> See I WATCHED DMC 1/2/3/4 then got into 5
[0:09:32] <%Mathochism> Oh boy. It's Pat suffering season again.
[0:09:32] <%Broand> and not the lulz kind
[0:09:32] <artoflec> they're both fantastic games but the games are similar all throughout, going from nioh 1 right to nioh 2 would be exhausting. I tried to play Okamiden right after Okami and i couldn't elaPain
[0:09:33] <%MugenSandan> ESPECIALLY 2
[0:09:34] <%Blank9> you can't appreciate dragon's dogma unless you read all of berserk
[0:09:35] <%TheAntiNihilist> @dova573 we'll see. he'll know in about an hour
[0:09:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> >the Yakuza series, being interested in 7 is hell
[0:09:38] <%cvp5127> i played all the 2d metroid before dread
[0:09:39] <%Mr_Initials> Mr_Initials subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Hey Pat, just played warframe for the first time in like 2 years this week. Oh boy theres loads of spoilers now
[0:09:43] <%President_Miyazaki> President_Miyazaki subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 44 months! Oh hey that super good game that gives you a ton more tools but is still like... exactly as difficult as Nioh 1.
[0:09:43] <Dr_Mooose> did that minus 2
[0:09:52] <+Mrbaconator> that's not just you
[0:09:59] <+pectusumbra> *nod*
[0:10:01] <%EynoStiles> @mr_initials Is that game good?
[0:10:03] <%Bluwizard21> Bluwizard21 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! You do any beard care? I recently started using beard oil and balm
[0:10:05] <%MelfinaStarwind> I feel you there
[0:10:06] <+Dova573> @TheAntiNihilist Do you mean Globlin wise then yeah
[0:10:07] <%dekkitout> Can't go back to anything pre pkmn black and white
[0:10:07] <+Mrbaconator> that just sucks in general
[0:10:08] <SilverFaustX> fuck random skills
[0:10:16] <%justcallmebobplease> That is NOT just a goblin-afflicted people thing, that's a quality of life thing!
[0:10:20] <artoflec> going back to Nioh 1 won't have like "im glad they changed this" more than just "oh right this mechanic doesn't exist"
[0:10:25] <%maskofmichael> Choo Chooo HypeCool
[0:10:26] <%Blank9> @artoflec oh god yeah, I still can't even bother to go back for nioh 1's dlc because 2 still has so much EVERYTHING
[0:10:27] <%cooldude69xx> cooldude69xx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Hey pat! Merry Christmas! I oughta be starting a new job after the holidays, wish me luck!
[0:10:27] <+xpakeo> honestly playing dmc5 invalidates playing dmc1-4 imo
[0:10:33] <+pectusumbra> The trick to that is "Yeah that's fine."
[0:10:36] <+SilverDevilfish> The trick is who cares Nioh 2 is straight up better
[0:10:36] <%W1nterTitan> same
[0:10:37] <SilverFaustX> only 300
[0:10:38] <saddest_man> THE TIME HAS COME
[0:10:44] <SaltyAzteca> yes. the backlog is real.
[0:10:47] <+Tucker0603> is dog snoring
[0:11:01] <SilverFaustX> i still have xbox360 games to play..
[0:11:06] <%EynoStiles> a new goblin has appeared
[0:11:06] <DancesWitBalrog> watch BFP DMC 1 through 4, then play 5
[0:11:07] <%Cozy90> i have brink in my stream library Kappa
[0:11:07] <%Mr_Initials> @EynoStiles  Its good, but theres a lot of grinding if you don't spend money
[0:11:13] <sharksdanger> little baby
[0:11:13] <artoflec> @Blank9 nioh 1 dlc's are insane yeah, nioh 2's felt a lot better lol. BUT there's some cool ass shit in that DLC that is actually relevant in nioh 2 LUL
[0:11:15] <%AHomeschoolDropout> also you might rush through 1 to get to 2 and not actually enjoy it
[0:11:17] <%Agami23> imagine trying to get into kingdom hearts 3 without playing all of kingdom hearts union X, which isnt available now
[0:11:22] <nejtcq> @xpakeo What about DMC3?
[0:11:25] <+UKOrigin> the scythe is rad as hell, loved being able to go full magic
[0:11:32] <+Tucker0603> I love dogs, got my two babies on the couch with me @patstaresat
[0:11:33] <%Mr_Initials> @Cozy90 I preordered brink
[0:11:39] <+AngriestAngryArtist> big pro tip.  Nioh 2 has fist weapons therefore punching > slashing.
[0:11:39] <+maynardftw> Can't wait
[0:11:41] <%Nobrev> Nobrev subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 42 months! woo
[0:11:42] <+tempestzephyr> the story seems nonsensical
[0:11:43] <Captbutt> many niohs
[0:11:46] <%holydeviant1> holydeviant1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! My mother had a rule where I could only get a new game in a series if I'd completed earlier installments (if she was buying) so I was on FF7 for night on 9 years because she had the copy and I visited every other weekend. It took SO LOOOOONG
[0:11:47] <artoflec> Also the whole london intro part in Nioh 1 is interesting but sucks on replay DansGame
[0:11:47] <SaltyAzteca> godspeed Pat
[0:11:48] <+rafaelba93> its not like nioh has a grrat story or anything like that
[0:11:48] <+Local16> ready for more options?
[0:11:50] <DancesWitBalrog> KH Union X ruined my life
[0:11:52] <KaironFortressKnight> I am excited to see the Mind Gobli- I mean Mind Onis at work
[0:11:53] <+Dova573> Honestly Is funny that I'm excited for stranger of paradise solely because I played and beat both niohs
[0:11:55] <%tauntauntaunt> Imagine deciding to get into kingdom hearts
[0:11:56] <%KishinGrek> who cares?
[0:11:56] <%Agami23> KH3 plays badly though so its fine
[0:11:59] <%EynoStiles> @patstaresat Did you get a new remote?
[0:11:59] <Zebroneath> That's the worst one, for sure
[0:11:59] <Hamborgini> mini-goblin: just run past the first big enemy instead of trying to fight it for hours
[0:12:00] <cartakus> Gonna get to new game ++++?
[0:12:00] <HeavyC4> I'm a vanilla dude and went for Katana/Odachi built Chat.
[0:12:01] <KatabolicRage> Kingdom hearts is another kind of stupid where they released every entry across a million platforms
[0:12:02] <+UKOrigin> i need a good nioh 2 lp!!!
[0:12:06] <%superc37> pc or or ps5?
[0:12:11] <+Mrbaconator> KH3 is a let down 2 is better
[0:12:13] <+xpakeo> @nejtcq 3 is very good but going back after playing 5 it doesnt feel nearly as good, its only better in terms of story
[0:12:16] <Nickhead93> Fist weapons or bust
[0:12:17] <+Kyma1020> I mean the cutscenes in Union X are available
[0:12:20] <bob900000> but it has tge number 3 /s
[0:12:21] <%maskofmichael> Just play KH2, it's the best one
[0:12:21] <@Ranryu692> they really shouldn't have called it Kingdom Hearts 3
[0:12:22] <Zebroneath> yes
[0:12:22] <sharksdanger> yes
[0:12:22] <kizraxx> yes
[0:12:22] <+EmptyPenguin> yes
[0:12:23] <@Ranryu692> yeah
[0:12:23] <%Agami23> yes
[0:12:24] <+ladomania> it's Union Cross
[0:12:24] <%Akizea> yerp
[0:12:24] <SilverFaustX> yes
[0:12:24] <%maskofmichael> Yes
[0:12:26] <%holydeviant1> Probably
[0:12:26] <DancesWitBalrog> YES
[0:12:26] <%KishinGrek> yes
[0:12:27] <artoflec> i mean, final mix maybe, but 3 is right bheind it
[0:12:27] <Daemyx> yes
[0:12:28] <+WildcardM> yes 100%
[0:12:29] <+UKOrigin> yes and no
[0:12:29] <dexdestroyazz> yup
[0:12:30] <bob900000> debatable
[0:12:30] <SuperButterBuns> most would say yes
[0:12:30] <+Kyma1020> KH2 is still the best even with limit cut
[0:12:31] <%KishinGrek> but far
[0:12:31] <%superc37> fuck
[0:12:31] <%Blank9> absolutely yes
[0:12:31] <HeavyC4> yes but KH3 got dlc and modding
[0:12:32] <sharksdanger> ikr
[0:12:33] <%holydeviant1> Best gameplay, anyway
[0:12:33] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat I have heard Bulldogs are fart machines - do you have any silly stories to support or deny this?
[0:12:33] <%kid_flashionable> Yeah
[0:12:33] <SaltyAzteca> I mean KH2 is KINDA hard to top
[0:12:33] <%Akizea> only other game that comes close is 358/2 imo
[0:12:33] <%cvp5127> imagine making a gacha relevant to the plot
[0:12:34] <Profmcstevie> YES, 2 FM specifically
[0:12:34] <+Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt KH2 has cool dual wielding, KH3 took that away
[0:12:35] <KaironFortressKnight> Yes, but 3 with DLC is pretty close
[0:12:35] <%KishinGrek> By far
[0:12:37] <+TunakIn> just watch clemps's videos on them
[0:12:39] <Captbutt> i liked 3 better but maybe im weird
[0:12:39] <%barrakuta371> psaWhat
[0:12:40] <+Kyma1020> Limit Cut is great but you still have 3
[0:12:41] <%TheAntiNihilist> it's worth it.
[0:12:42] <HeavyC4> KH2 is still the best
[0:12:42] <signofzeta> kh2 is the best one ez
[0:12:43] <CH3F015> YES
[0:12:44] <SilverFaustX> but the first 2hours still suck
[0:12:44] <+UKOrigin> kh3 remind has the best gameplay
[0:12:45] <@Ranryu692> Birth By Sleep is quite good, despite being a PSP game
[0:12:47] <%codedoomboy> Yes
[0:12:47] <%TreeVoidYT> KH3 Re:Mind has the bet combat imo
[0:12:48] <%justcallmebobplease> KH2 was lit AF
[0:12:50] <+Mrbaconator> KH3 TOOK cool ass shit away
[0:12:52] <%kid_flashionable> 3 with DLC is the closest they've gotten to hitting it
[0:12:52] <artoflec> 3 has better worlds though, easily the best in the series
[0:12:53] <ape_hawk> GET UP ON THE HYDRA'S BACK
[0:12:54] <%shurtal> Goofy fuckin DIES
[0:12:57] <SaltyAzteca> its got THAT setpiece. and THAT set piece.
[0:12:57] <+MrMegaJackpots> BBS is cool
[0:12:57] <%Mr_Initials> How can you not say dream drop
[0:12:59] <sharksdanger> bbs is good too
[0:13:00] <Shwepie> @PatStaresAt Kingdom Hearts is also the best isekai hands down.
[0:13:01] <%holydeviant1> They could release a bloody palace based on 2's systems and make it really big and it'd be FUCKING PERFECT
[0:13:03] <SilverFaustX> D:
[0:13:03] <kizraxx> my favorite combat
[0:13:05] <%KishinGrek> @ranryu692 it was ported
[0:13:06] <+WildcardM> im gonna be honest, i followed kingdom hearts my entire life, 2 was my favorite ps2 game. I felt NOTHING playing 3
[0:13:08] <+Tucker0603> I could never get into KH
[0:13:08] <+Mrbaconator> oh ye BBS is good
[0:13:10] <%EynoStiles> I new understood the hype for the KH games
[0:13:11] <+UKOrigin> the kh3 superbosses are perfection
[0:13:14] <+Mrbaconator> THAT guys nuts
[0:13:15] <+Dova573> nah
[0:13:16] <DancesWitBalrog> Wut
[0:13:18] <+EmptyPenguin> but it's not an isekai
[0:13:18] <@Ranryu692> @KishinGrek yeah, but I never played the ports so I can't comment
[0:13:19] <HeavyC4> KH is isekai.
[0:13:19] <%maskofmichael> No Thats Wrong
[0:13:20] <%barrakuta371> psaWhat
[0:13:20] <%PocketBearIllustrator> kh3's combat system is its own beast imo
[0:13:23] <kizraxx> KEKW
[0:13:24] <DancesWitBalrog> Pepega Clap
[0:13:26] <Captbutt> i mean technically
[0:13:27] <ape_hawk> the best isekai is Farscape
[0:13:27] <+Kyma1020> You go to other worlds? kinda a stretch
[0:13:27] <HeavyC4> KH is isekai to Disney worlds.
[0:13:30] <SaltyAzteca> I get that. but its a weaker isekai
[0:13:31] <%KishinGrek> it doesn't count as an esekai
[0:13:31] <%superc37> i mean
[0:13:31] <Captbutt> you do go to other worlds
[0:13:32] <+ShinHadokenman> Pat Sora gets dropped into another word in the first game
[0:13:33] <%barrakuta371> psaBig psaWrong
[0:13:33] <+Mrbaconator> it is an isekai but like nah
[0:13:34] <+ShinHadokenman> Think about it
[0:13:35] <%LtSurge> The tron parts are
[0:13:37] <artoflec> I guess if we saw more of Sora's like..actual home where he came from it might be.
[0:13:37] <%holydeviant1> It's only BARELY an isekai at all!
[0:13:37] <%JoshManVGH> kinda
[0:13:37] <+coolthulhuu> i mean it kinda is
[0:13:37] <%justcallmebobplease> Isn't it?  Sora adventures on places that are not his world...
[0:13:38] <%Agami23> you go to other planets all the time pat
[0:13:39] <%kid_flashionable> I think it actually counts, but barely
[0:13:40] <%cvp5127> first world counts
[0:13:41] <+McSoliace> "in another world"
[0:13:43] <+maynardftw> Isekai is someone getting taken from the normal world into a fantasy world. They were already in a fantasy world.
[0:13:44] <cyberblueneon> thats not what fucking isekai means
[0:13:46] <@Ranryu692> by the most literal definition of isekai, it does
[0:13:46] <%codedoomboy> No
[0:13:47] <%SaiyanShoto> It kinda is
[0:13:47] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Black Knight is the best isekai.
[0:13:48] <+TunakIn> sora gets portaled
[0:13:48] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> if you like KH your a loser no cap, psaDab
[0:13:49] <%EynoStiles> @ape_hawk holy shit it is an isekai
[0:13:49] <%KishinGrek> psaBig idiot
[0:13:49] <%TheAntiNihilist> yes it us
[0:13:51] <%maskofmichael> Sora is not from Modern Day, so no
[0:13:52] <bob900000> kinda
[0:13:54] <cartakus> Does the protag die to travel?
[0:13:55] <stote44> wow is the best isekai
[0:13:55] <%UvBenServed> Dragonball is the best isekai
[0:13:56] <+EmptyPenguin> Saying KH is an isekai is like saying Star Wars is an isekai
[0:13:57] <%justcallmebobplease> 'Another world' defines every place Sora goes.
[0:13:57] <Treasure_Vault> Don't you fall through a magic door? That's isekai
[0:13:57] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Doom is my favorite Isekai
[0:13:58] <+Dova573> if KH is an iseak then so is mario 64
[0:14:00] <%Blank9> is roxas an anti-isekai
[0:14:02] <+meermadon> to really understand KH you have to watch every Disney film and play every FF, else you're not a true fan
[0:14:03] <KatabolicRage> sometimes I wished he would get hit by a truck
[0:14:03] <+coolthulhuu> its an isekai like narnia is an isekai, which is i guess??
[0:14:04] <+Dova573> isekai
[0:14:04] <HeavyC4> sora got hit by DARKNESS
[0:14:05] <+Mrbaconator> a truck doesn't have to be a aprt of it
[0:14:05] <$sleepystardewfarmer> That doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about Kingdom Hearts to dispute it
[0:14:06] <sharksdanger> he gets hit by da darkness
[0:14:06] <%Goatbait> I thought they meant Roxas being isekai'd
[0:14:06] <%justcallmebobplease> Truck-kun is NOT mandatory for isekai!
[0:14:07] <Jaysky> @davidcrimsonheidern *you're
[0:14:09] <%SovPho> yeah it was the Disney satellite lot shuttle
[0:14:09] <%superc37> he should tho
[0:14:09] <+Kyma1020> he gets sucked into space
[0:14:09] <%twistedj3ster> Pft, I wish
[0:14:10] <+UKOrigin> he got sucked off by the darkness
[0:14:10] <@Ranryu692> that's just a trope not a rule
[0:14:11] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Sora getting hit by a truck is just wishful thinking on our part LUL
[0:14:12] <%EynoStiles> but sora does go to diffefent world
[0:14:13] <$Ziegsy> Hello pat and chat! I am back! Took a break to finish endwalker!
[0:14:13] <Treasure_Vault> That's Tensei!
[0:14:13] <%shurtal> Truck = World Apocalypse
[0:14:13] <+WildcardM> goofy gets hit by a rock does that count
[0:14:14] <+V3RTIGO_222> don't technically have to die in an Isekai right?
[0:14:14] <+McSoliace> the mnatrix is a form of isekai
[0:14:15] <%kid_flashionable> no but his world got norted tho
[0:14:15] <cartakus> Trucker-chan
[0:14:16] <Captbutt> some peepo
[0:14:16] <%SaiyanShoto> He got hit by a wave which is a water truck
[0:14:16] <Profmcstevie> You don't remember Donald casting Truckaga??
[0:14:16] <cricket42069> isekai-yai motherf*
[0:14:17] <%holydeviant1> I mean, no one died in the OG isekai (Alice in wonderland)
[0:14:19] <DancesWitBalrog> stretching the definition
[0:14:20] <Enn19> And then Sora went to Midgard
[0:14:20] <KaironFortressKnight> This is an isekai. Pat died and got reincarnated in a smaller body in our world.
[0:14:21] <%Cozy90> tetris is my favorite isekai
[0:14:21] <Senselessvirus> Overlord exists so that is factually wrong.
[0:14:22] <Treasure_Vault> Tensei is reincarnation, isekai is just going I think
[0:14:23] <%afronooch> its not for us
[0:14:23] <%MrMegaJackpots> it's really cool tho
[0:14:23] <artoflec> is that Pandamonium or whatever
[0:14:24] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> psaDab psaDab psaDab
[0:14:24] <Dr_Mooose> fair
[0:14:25] <Nickhead93> KH  usually is stupid
[0:14:25] <+Kyma1020> fair
[0:14:25] <+coolthulhuu> D:
[0:14:27] <%EynoStiles> Wha about that white light
[0:14:28] <SaltyAzteca> @heavyc4 the darkness hit LIKE A TRUCK
[0:14:29] <@Ranryu692> good, I missed being able to watch you stream

[0:14:34] <%Castle_Kundarak> Totally fair
[0:14:35] <%Mr_Initials> cowboy in king arthurs court is best isekai
[0:14:35] <DancesWitBalrog> Trucker of DARKNESS
[0:14:35] <%pokefan9956> people are joking, but KH is totally an Isekai
[0:14:37] <+maynardftw> Pat is a handsome boi today
[0:14:39] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> do it, no pokeballs
[0:14:39] <+WeLucklessJacks> Sora is cast from his world into various other worlds on adventures, so it qualifies.
[0:14:39] <Treasure_Vault> good, mmos are stinky
[0:14:41] <Reveresao> Have Minj do it
[0:14:43] <@GeneralSCPatton> The definition of Isekai has to be sufficient to exclude Star Trek from the genre.
[0:14:43] <cartakus> booooo
[0:14:44] <%MrMegaJackpots> last fight has good music
[0:14:45] <Reveresao> Minh*

[0:14:53] <+UKOrigin> you did this last time, your unfinished lps are literally my mind goblins
[0:14:53] <@ssjklyco> I'm interested in the unwritten story of Sora's parents spending years looking for their lost child
[0:14:55] <%EynoStiles> Where is the missus?
[0:15:05] <Shwepie> Isekai literally means "Another World", all you do in Kingdom Hearts is go to other worlds.
[0:15:14] <%NitronStreams> Incredible
[0:15:15] <+SpiritRoads> starting nioh 2 or continuing now?
[0:15:15] <DancesWitBalrog> BOP spoilers?

[0:15:20] <huskarl_zap> oh so you haven't finished it pat?
[0:15:20] <cyberblueneon> isekai is a specific thing, its not just anything where you go to another world
[0:15:23] <penitentpendant> "You tried?"
[0:15:33] <HeavyC4> Sora world is normal. there no magic or anything. the other worlds got magic. so yes. KH is isekai. it even got the twist with riku being the original chosen one.
[0:15:41] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> psaDab psaDab psaDab
[0:15:54] <HeavyC4> MONEY
[0:15:57] <cartakus> Isekai is a plague of a genre
[0:16:01] <HeavyC4> money is a big motivation
[0:16:02] <%justcallmebobplease> That is NOT what's going on with Paige, and you know it.
[0:16:11] <@Ranryu692> ADHD is weird like that
[0:16:13] <%SovPho> Arithmetic is what they fool students into thinking math is.
[0:16:16] <ape_hawk> is paige literally the math meme?
[0:16:19] <+TopTieramisu> alice in wonderland and wizard of oz are isekai
[0:16:19] <Profmcstevie> Passion provides focus for ADHD
[0:16:23] <%Cozy90> When are we getting a "The bouncer" sequal?
[0:16:32] <amiavamp> Orbital math suddenly doesn't seem too hard when Kerbal Space Program makes it fun
[0:16:33] <%SovPho> just graduated with a degree in CS and applied math
[0:16:34] <@PrefectusCorgi> ME
[0:16:36] <@tizz86> @justcallmebobplease LUL
[0:16:40] <DancesWitBalrog> Baba is Who?
[0:16:42] <+McSoliace> isekai is so broad it can mean anything
[0:16:48] <marvel877> what I miss?
[0:16:49] <cyberblueneon> this is the like the argument that every game where you play a role is an rpg
[0:16:54] <ape_hawk> do it
[0:16:56] <ape_hawk> coward
[0:16:56] <%WhereIsWill> YES
[0:16:57] <+TopTieramisu> well, not anything

[0:17:01] <Treasure_Vault> oh goodie
[0:17:03] <Profmcstevie> ....welll :)
[0:17:03] <%Mr_Initials> Is walking outside, an isekai?
[0:17:04] <%maskofmichael> @marvel877 Pat raps now

[0:17:08] <%superc37> do it pussy
[0:17:08] <%PatchTheSquid> Gief snore are so cute
[0:17:10] <%justcallmebobplease> @tizz86 I would literally freak out if Paige ever showed up and casually was doing higher end math to prove she gets it now.
[0:17:11] <+UKOrigin> say the thing bart

[0:17:15] <%maskofmichael> Pat say "WORD"

[0:17:21] <%EynoStiles> this best ADHD bullshit, is when it gives you the zoomies, but forces your brain to not want to get up.
[0:17:23] <%valriot> BOVINE? LUL
[0:17:24] <+TopTieramisu> a person being transported to another world. that would be what i would define an isekai
[0:17:24] <+Mrbaconator> bo-vine, colonest guy
[0:17:24] <+Caidezes> LUL
[0:17:27] <DancesWitBalrog> @mr_initials it is now. thanks covid!

[0:17:33] <%Goatbait> fucking Bovine
[0:17:34] <Shwepie> @McSoliace If you really want to stretch the definition of it, any fish out of water story is an isekai.
[0:17:34] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> ayyyy

[0:17:57] <%WhereIsWill> thats awful, which is why its on point
[0:17:57] <+UKOrigin> its clipped, you dont need to
[0:17:59] <%Saadi90> Better than Drake
[0:18:00] <marvel877> Oh, we paying him to rap now?
[0:18:01] <%NitronStreams> Droppin Hot Bars
[0:18:03] <cartakus> Let us feast
[0:18:05] <Captbutt> uhhh
[0:18:11] <%slimmixrp> slimmixrp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 14 month streak! Eeeeeeee
[0:18:13] <+maynardftw> Then he told me of the significance! - "It will be significant."
[0:18:16] <+SpiritRoads> more fun prequel
[0:18:20] <cartakus> AND a sequel
[0:18:21] <%superc37> its a prequel up until the very last act
[0:18:21] <+WildcardM> nioh 2 can be confusing but mmaaaaaaaaan is it satisfying to play
[0:18:25] <%maskofmichael> Then why not call it Nioh 0?
[0:18:31] <%justcallmebobplease> Worth a shot!
[0:18:36] <Captbutt> @cartakus kinda spoilery
[0:18:42] <%Blank9> because it's the 2nd nioh, duh
[0:18:43] <HeavyC4> Which would be better? Dark Souls X sekiro or Nioh X Bloodborne?
[0:18:45] <+SpiritRoads> Nioh 2 is great cause you can reset your character design at any point for FREE
[0:18:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can actually re-make your character at any point from the main menu
[0:18:53] <%pokefan9956> @patstaresat , the real way to fight this mindgoblin would be to skip to the second entry in a story heavy series
[0:18:54] <%holydeviant1> SAAAAME
[0:18:54] <+maynardftw> -1
[0:18:55] <%superc37> also that doesn't work since in nioh you can change your appearance whenever
[0:18:59] <%Mr_Initials> Oh someone already mentioned warframe
[0:18:59] <cartakus> Not like he cares for story of nioh 1
[0:19:01] <%epide> you can always change your pcs face in this one
[0:19:03] <%holydeviant1> new warframe can sit forever
[0:19:06] <President_valentine> Nioh 2 fist weapons are some of the most fun i had in a game in a long time
[0:19:09] <%Mr_Initials> Now I want to remove my chat message
[0:19:14] <+kevlarkoala> I'm here because I have this exact same Goblin. I've had this game since 2018 and can not turn it on. fuck me
[0:19:19] <+polothegreatest> bitterEnd
[0:19:21] <+McSoliace> no
[0:19:22] <mortal_dragom> @HeavyC4 nioh and bloodborne for sure i really didnt like sekiro
[0:19:27] <+coolthulhuu> oh yesh the fists are op in nioh 2
[0:19:28] <$Ziegsy> Three you can do. Do 2
[0:19:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now that would be a good bit
[0:19:31] <%shurtal> oh god, i threw up a little bit when you said that
[0:19:32] <+MajesticDoogle> that isn't a goblin that is just a bad decision lol
[0:19:33] <%holydeviant1> That's not mind gobs that's just intentionally confusing yourself
[0:19:34] <Treasure_Vault> And talk to no one between missions
[0:19:36] <%Mr_Initials> Isn't trails like 60 hours
[0:19:37] <+McSoliace> that hurt ME
[0:19:38] <%justcallmebobplease> Are you sure it wasn't Trails of Cold Steel 4 that was recced, over 3?
[0:19:43] <%Blank9> start star wars at 3
[0:19:46] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> psaDab psaDab psaDab
[0:19:49] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Oh god that series is like actually worse than Yakuza when it comes to understanding the plot if you didn't play the previous one
[0:19:49] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt If you're at all unsure of what weapon you'd like to go for, I totally recommend giving the fist weapons at least a look.
[0:19:51] <+Tucker0603> fist weapons are cool but I can't link the crazy combo move together worth shit
[0:20:02] <HeavyC4> imagine playing cold steel when you can play Ys.
[0:20:03] <+UKOrigin> i hope you finish this on stream, my goblins cant take it left unfinished lol
[0:20:05] <%maskofmichael> But you know what happens
[0:20:05] <@Ranryu692> and that's coming from someone who did it
[0:20:08] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> NigelSchnauzerpug subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months, currently on a 58 month streak! What would Pat's perfect survival horror game look like? What would it be about?
[0:20:12] <Profmcstevie> Yeah? a blurb is not a part
[0:20:12] <+McSoliace> just read the manga at that point
[0:20:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wikipedia plot synopses are the only way to consume media
[0:20:17] <amiavamp> Fists are op 1v1 but you'll really want to git gud with a secondary weapon that can handle crowds easier
[0:20:18] <%Blank9> fist are fun, everything is fun
[0:20:22] <%Agami23> i skipped to part 4, read everything ahead of it up to part 8, then went back to watch part 1 and 2 and still have never looked at part 3
[0:20:24] <+kevlarkoala> @mortalmanbaby i hated sekiro until I stopped classifying it as a Souls game, now I fucking love it
[0:20:27] <%RayReborne> oh i smell a hint
[0:20:30] <President_valentine> Fucking Dempsey Rolling yokai is the sickest
[0:20:38] <+coolthulhuu> im at 1070 :)
[0:20:39] <%maskofmichael> @McSoliace But it's so LONG
[0:20:42] <+rafaelba93> i love nioh 2 but i kinda suck at it
[0:20:56] <%PatchTheSquid> Very Excited to see pat play this
[0:20:59] <cartakus> So when is next ninja gaiden?
[0:21:00] <+Tucker0603> love head smashing with hammer
[0:21:01] <%Blank9> fist + switchglaive for maximum new weapon actually worked ok
[0:21:01] <mortal_dragom> @kevlarkoala i got all the way to the end and just wasnt enjoying the boss fights as much as just struggaling through them becuse i had to .
[0:21:08] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> I tried Nioh 1 again after Pat's stream, holy shit the Odachi fucks
[0:21:25] <theshillman> hello today!
[0:21:28] <%NitronStreams> hi pat. he's pat.

[0:21:34] <kikoeru_san> I'm super bias on this one, but the first weapons in this game are super dope
[0:21:41] <+McSoliace> @maskofmichael so is life
[0:21:44] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Have you heard about crypto and by extension NFTs are going to be treated as securities which requires all of them to have to be registered by the SEC and the Candain equivalant
[0:21:50] <kikoeru_san> fist, goddamn auto correct
[0:21:55] <%Blank9> the main thing with leveling alts is just deal with getting 2-3 levels a day from roulette and fairy stuff and take it slow and easy
[0:22:00] <+kevlarkoala> @mortalmanbaby i straight up cheesed DoH, and it took me a full week to actually beat Isshin. I'm with you man
[0:22:01] <+Tucker0603> TBH I picked up switchglaive just cause I have a massive crush on Tate Eboshi
[0:22:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> So did Pat build a character already or are we gonna get a character creator stream?
[0:22:14] <+Orcapugs> About to beat first samurai with Odaci
[0:22:15] <%JoshManVGH> @phantommig That's rad!
[0:22:16] <%cvp5127> is scythe still op?
[0:22:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> Like with beard soap?
[0:22:27] <cartakus> Leveling dps is a pain compared to tank
[0:22:28] <fugly_nick> @ReallyBigRocks I think someone is giving him a preset code
[0:22:35] <Treasure_Vault> dip it in the lard trough
[0:22:39] <mortal_dragom> BIG snores
[0:22:41] <%Blank9> scythe is good but not quite op besides one move in particular
[0:22:41] <+polothegreatest> snore puppy OhMyDog
[0:22:50] <%dekkitout> Dassit? No oils?
[0:23:09] <cartakus> Also ultima weapon looks like a godzilla mecha monster
[0:23:17] <+McSoliace> i kinda respect that
[0:23:39] <RLT917> LUL
[0:23:41] <+Tucker0603> REV THAT PUPPER MOTOR
[0:23:45] <Profmcstevie> Can you rev the Zangief
[0:23:46] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Gief is what powers the house.
[0:23:53] <mortal_dragom> oh yea thats a v6 helldog he revving

[0:23:54] <%patriotrenegade> patriotrenegade subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months! Remember Mercenaries 2? That game was jank as fuck. I once saw a pickup truck fly across the sky. Helicopters got stuck in midair. Soldiers clipped through the ground. Objectives proct before I got to them. I fucking loved that game.
[0:23:58] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Use his snores to power everything!
[0:24:09] <%valriot> Living Dead existing for 8 years isnt being a baby
[0:24:14] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> drk still shit
[0:24:18] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I swear i thought the controller was Zangiefs harness
[0:24:19] <%shanna_become_gamer> Robopuppy commence yipping
[0:24:20] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> psaDab psaDab
[0:24:26] <%JoshManVGH> It's defensive capabilities are categorically worse than every other tank.
[0:24:27] <%Blank9> dark knight feels like it's relegated to incredibly good offtank
[0:24:31] <%patriotrenegade> I STILL love Mercenaries 2.
[0:24:32] <%holydeviant1> HA HA HA HOLMGANG
[0:24:35] <%walternatorz> is that true for extreme fights?
[0:24:43] <TranquiloArman> Warrior kind of really strong
[0:24:44] <%MrMegaJackpots> MrMegaJackpots subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! hey pat, any thoughts on what new vocations would you want to see in a potential Dragons Dogma 2?
[0:24:45] <%MugenSandan> DRK mains are only sad because the other tanks are equally as cool as they are
[0:24:49] <@Ranryu692> Warrior is the only tank I haven't touched, but I fear that by the time I got it to 50 they'll have nerfed it lol
[0:24:50] <penitentpendant> I worry for the Nerf Sledgehammer on the horizon
[0:24:51] <%YakumoYomi> YakumoYomi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 21 month streak! After all the Endwalker hype, I finally decided to jump into FFXIV. And after about two weeks playing, I think I'm addicting. Thanks Pat.
[0:24:53] <%CalderGaming> the ultimate fantasy
[0:24:55] <cartakus> Dark knight is suffering
[0:25:07] <%MooseIsGoose> @patriotrenegade I never played the second one only he 1st is it on pc
[0:25:08] <Jflaskd13> I just like all the tanks more than DK as it's abilities look a bit too boring
[0:25:10] <mortal_dragom> just dont get hit
[0:25:11] <+UKOrigin> prepare for nerfs in 6.05, same as reaper
[0:25:14] <%Agami23> darknight is blue dps, paladin is blue healer, warrior is blue tank, and gunbreaker is blue dps2
[0:25:18] <TranquiloArman> Is TBN now the worst defensive button?
[0:25:21] <%JohnMcClanesBrother> JohnMcClanesBrother subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hi Pat. Is that an engine in the background?
[0:25:22] <%Blank9> warrior is THE main tank now, gunbreaker the main tank that needs healer attention
[0:25:26] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> *Laughs in paladin* i solo the last boss of 85 dungon
[0:25:30] <%Blank9> and paladin/dk off tanks
[0:25:38] <Profmcstevie> How healers can pick up Dragoons fucking up with their new found spare time
[0:25:39] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Pat
[0:25:43] <fugly_nick> Well, that was a good stream
[0:25:43] <+polothegreatest> revvvv OhMyDog
[0:25:44] <Profmcstevie> *now
[0:25:44] <%patriotrenegade> lol look at his butt cushion he broke the couch
[0:25:45] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Pat's going on strike
[0:25:46] <%croxeye> DRK  can't even abyssal drain solo targets anymore cuz it shares a cast time with C&S
[0:25:53] <%holydeviant1> Hahahah, they're not showing your character at login to speed it up!
[0:26:06] <%TheWinged7> ahh i see butt pillow is streaming today
[0:26:08] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> this was a good stream see you all tomarrow
[0:26:23] <%Blank9> I'm still going gunbreaker because continuation go brrrrr
[0:26:26] <cartakus> Does DRK need a full rework or some tweaks?
[0:26:29] <%shurtal> i got one
[0:26:30] <%CalderGaming> @holydeviant1 that's been the case on and off since early access
[0:26:30] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt what system are you playing on?
[0:26:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> I have the same one Pat :)
[0:26:32] <%patriotrenegade> u broke the couch with ur dumptruck ass
[0:26:32] <%JoshManVGH> GNB has harder time with trash pulls than Warrior for sure, but I'm feeling significantly less killable than DRK against bosses
[0:26:33] <+Zengaku> good for your tooshie
[0:26:33] <%afronooch> i got one, but thats cause my cahir sucks
[0:26:35] <%SaiyanShoto> You got it backwards
[0:26:38] <%twistedj3ster> yours looks like it yearns for death tho
[0:26:39] <%WhereIsWill> its not in a great spot now, but it sure was when he was the posterchild in shb
[0:26:41] <+KBGuilty> Whats up Patsterz
[0:26:47] <TranquiloArman> Is Butt pillow like getting a real nice ergonomic chair for except for your butt?
[0:26:47] <Dio_TR> Butt pillow = Old?
[0:26:49] <%TheWinged7> but paaaaaaatuh, you lost your butt groove
[0:26:50] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> it needs new buttons or give it more heals
[0:26:51] <cricket42069> i also have a butt pillow, but it's funny to see yours lookin all red velvet decadent
[0:26:52] <%RealThiele> armchair doctors always say its backwards
[0:26:53] <%Cozy90> I use one for work cause i drive around alot
[0:26:53] <%shanna_become_gamer> Butt & back support yeeeea
[0:26:55] <%SharkMissile> I can't wait to see how you make your character.
[0:27:11] <+MoonObscure> agreed
[0:27:16] <%KishinGrek> KishinGrek subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! if you could make 1 conspiracy theory throughout history be true, which would it be?
[0:27:22] <+SliceOfGouda> Give Dark Knight a butt pillow
[0:27:29] <CommunistJugular> do you have an opinion on the grapes?
[0:27:34] <+Tucker0603> @patstaresat I still have power slash on my bar cause it's a much cooler animation then the other one
[0:27:35] <%W1nterTitan> Living dead is just " I want die"
[0:27:38] <scrumbotime> @KishinGrek Birds aren't real
[0:27:39] <cartakus> Well that is frustating
[0:27:41] <%skrewarrior> skrewarrior subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:27:47] <cricket42069> @SliceOfGouda dark knight's power comes from hemorrhoids
[0:27:54] <%WhereIsWill> drks cant have heal stuff, cuz that aint what drks do. sacrifices must be made, and it cant be hp, cuz its a tank
[0:28:00] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Break a game!
[0:28:01] <%Blank9> I wonder if there's even something that could be done with tbn because good lord it's so strong
[0:28:04] <%zeroarturia> Lol
[0:28:06] <SilverFaustX> sping time for patler
[0:28:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> csbeastE
[0:28:08] <Dio_TR> PAT ON ICE
[0:28:10] <%dekkitout> Yes yes yes
[0:28:11] <%JoshManVGH> Zombie status seems dumb overall. Wouldn't an enrage make more sense given their story?
[0:28:14] <%OthoZen> psaDogchamp
[0:28:17] <@PrefectusCorgi> Spring Time For ........
[0:28:19] <fugly_nick> So RE2 remake?
[0:28:22] <%maskofmichael> No Silent Hill 2?
[0:28:22] <%Blank9> but I love all the tanks' sustain improvements like bloodwhetting and heart of corundum
[0:28:26] <whimwhisp> isn't that... sortof what resident evil 2 remake is?
[0:28:32] <%JoshManVGH> "Don't succumb to your inner darkness!"
[0:28:33] <+StrikeTheErf> Living Dead might literally get Sage tweaked so it isn't basically a death sentence
[0:28:34] <KaironFortressKnight> That does sound like RE2 Remake
[0:28:38] <waltzqueen> @maskofmichael he's not sad enough
[0:28:42] <%RealThiele> Leon must continue the bloodline
[0:28:44] <@GeneralSCPatton> I have fond memories of Mercs 1
[0:28:47] <Shwepie> Pat's perfect survival horror would be the RE2 remake that is more faithful to the original.
[0:28:50] <%dekkitout> So are you suplexing in RC or are you on a train in Spain?
[0:28:53] <%justcallmebobplease> OH NO...
[0:28:55] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Pat, I see that you are looking very Pat today. Good job
[0:28:55] <%justcallmebobplease> OH NOOO...
[0:28:58] <%justcallmebobplease> OH NOOOO...
[0:29:01] <%patriotrenegade> I never beat Mercs 1
[0:29:02] <%justcallmebobplease> (Oh no you didn't)
[0:29:07] <cartakus> BETTER WARRIOR
[0:29:08] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Oh no you didn't
[0:29:10] <%Blank9> make another bitterblack isle, but more
[0:29:11] <+Axellogic> SPEARS
[0:29:13] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Let me fuse more magic classes with archer!!!
[0:29:14] <TranquiloArman> Just make magic not boring in Dragon's Dogma 2
[0:29:15] <%SvenHolgersson> SvenHolgersson subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! Greetings Patron of Orbeteria I just beat DeS and am prepared for Elden Ringjobs. What build are you excited to see In the Big Dark Souls?
[0:29:15] <waltzqueen> OH NO YOU DIDNT
[0:29:17] <yousomuch_> hello!
[0:29:20] <%EynoStiles> chrmeist
[0:29:20] <+Axellogic> GIVE SPEARS IN THE DOGMA
[0:29:20] <%WhereIsWill> FLY INTO FREEE
[0:29:21] <%patriotrenegade> I got to the second map tho
[0:29:22] <%justcallmebobplease> SUCKA TRIED TO PLAY ME, BUT HE DIDN'T PAY ME, NO NO - fuck that was a great track for that game.
[0:29:28] <%EynoStiles> chemist
[0:29:29] <cheapdoc> Hey Pat, do you like subsystems? 'cause you're about to get some motherfucking subsystems!
[0:29:30] <@ssjklyco> it's never coming
[0:29:34] <Shwepie> Honestly, I want Dragon's Dogma 2 more than Elden Ring at this point.
[0:29:36] <cartakus> Also halberds
[0:29:38] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Sucks we never got the Dragons Dogma MMO
[0:29:44] <%holydeviant1> Augh, got 2002'd
[0:29:52] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I want my spells to shoot 58 arrows at whoever I want
[0:30:01] <%skrewarrior> only 65 days 5 hours and 29 minutes left
[0:30:01] <scrumbotime> I would say "Make it so that you can just set pawn behavior" I hate, I hate that pawns learned things so badly and could end up useless
[0:30:06] <%KetsuoTaberu> what about "addicting"
[0:30:11] <Jflaskd13> Pat dropping truth
[0:30:14] <cartakus> It's so stimulating?
[0:30:15] <%valriot> So WoW
[0:30:22] <%patriotrenegade> I am addicted to PatStaresAt
[0:30:26] <+coolthulhuu> coxNod
[0:30:26] <waltzqueen> soooo animal crossing
[0:30:29] <Jflaskd13> FOMO tactics
[0:30:32] <%Blank9> every gacha I've ever tried then quit
[0:30:33] <%MelfinaStarwind> that's an excellent point melfin1Notes
[0:30:36] <JayEarly> Just make Dragon’s Dogma but with a better difficulty curve and better enemy variety
[0:30:36] <%holydeviant1> I've had that dissonance too
[0:30:40] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> That's why I hate games that have multiple limited events. I don't want to miss things, but I can't always get on.
[0:30:40] <%dekkitout> So they're using the right word half the time tajRLY
[0:30:44] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I am compelled to watch the second season of The Witcher
[0:30:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> "Engaging" is a good alternative
[0:30:45] <+Axellogic> I mean it is a sub bassed MMo so there prolly some of that in there too
[0:30:54] <Samk235> Samk235 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:30:56] <%KishinGrek> in that case, I'm addicted to Cod
[0:31:00] <+D00msDayDan> i love to halo
[0:31:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> John Halo is gonna beat me up if I don't capture more flags
[0:31:03] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt MMO's were the original big video game addiction on news media
[0:31:05] <cheapdoc> "I need that JPEG" they say while they scratch their neck, like Pat getting ninja space dolls
[0:31:07] <waltzqueen> gatcha are addictive by nature
[0:31:08] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I can never get into gatcha games, even NieR Reincarnation.
[0:31:11] <%AHomeschoolDropout> so basically any FOMO shit is purposefully designed to be addicting
[0:31:15] <%patriotrenegade> FLAT EARTH
[0:31:17] <%shurtal> 1700 queue, 80minutes, no 2002 erros
[0:31:20] <President_valentine> Birds aren't real
[0:31:22] <breadsbred> phone games/mmos (addictive) vs everything else (compelling). At least for me 😅
[0:31:24] <%AHomeschoolDropout> FLAT EARTH
[0:31:25] <Profmcstevie> birds
[0:31:27] <+StrikeTheErf> yep, and also shouldn't be used as just a slam against "live service game I don't like," it has specific baggage
[0:31:28] <%Stan4Apples> Lizard British Monarchy
[0:31:30] <scrumbotime> Birds aren't real
[0:31:31] <%SharkMissile> Pyramid aliens
[0:31:33] <%justcallmebobplease> Which one?  Answer: YES
[0:31:37] <Treasure_Vault> This is VR, real life is ncie
[0:31:39] <%HaloIsA> BUT ALIENS ARE REAL
[0:31:40] <Treasure_Vault> nice*
[0:31:41] <Gray_LoFi> Man fuck Halo Infinite's FOMO stuff, I grinded from Plat 4 to Diamond 3 all for a fuckin' toaster emblem
[0:31:43] <cheapdoc> Rats being able to swim
[0:31:43] <cartakus> Hollow earth
[0:31:44] <UncleAndross_> @President_valentine this would be amazing
[0:31:45] <%Cozy90> Pat your stream is so addictive. Kappa
[0:31:45] <%maskofmichael> Rats can swim
[0:31:46] <yousomuch_> aliens for sure!

[0:33:33] <%dalmek> @Axellogic is this what they meant by Neo Twewy? Nioh Two-y?
[0:33:33] <JayEarly> they don’t make sequels like this anymore that is literally just the first game but better
[0:33:36] <cheapdoc> Nioh is legit, WHAT LORE of dark souls

[0:33:52] <+JustToWatch> yes
[0:33:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yep
[0:33:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> This game has one of the best character creators I've ever used, but the presets are bad
[0:33:55] <+MajesticDoogle> there's not a dub lol
[0:33:55] <KaironFortressKnight> yep

[0:34:47] <Hamborgini> honestly it's refreshing to not hear americans all the time
[0:34:47] <+MajesticDoogle> i had no idea there was a dub lol

[0:34:56] <+UKOrigin> Whats Wrong With british, yall american exceptionalism is cancer
[0:34:57] <%KishinGrek> you coward

[0:35:03] <+bugz_munny> yeah if i remember correctly the patched it out as the default
[0:35:08] <%RayReborne> language
[0:35:13] <%Bt_Robot> Bt_Robot subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! How are you liking the BS difficulty spikes in Nioh 2?  I got killed more times than I could count from bullshit out of nowhere.
[0:35:17] <%SvenHolgersson> Dub vs. Sub? In MY Soulslike?!?!?!?!?
[0:35:18] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @EynoStiles Why would anything have for this?
[0:35:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> language
[0:35:22] <shiny_prinny> Language?
[0:35:22] <theshillman> reason #1: pat still holds hatred in his heart from his time in the pacific campaign 😔
[0:35:22] <%Cozy90> ああパットあなたはそのような子供です。
[0:35:23] <%NitronStreams> Im watiching on mobile so subtitles basically dont exist for me
[0:35:24] <%RyTYoung> At least William spoke English that's all you need Kappa
[0:35:27] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Pat says Yes to Background Lurkers
[0:35:29] <%MaritimeFox> I wonder if the dub is American or British accented.
[0:35:30] <+SpiritRoads> GREEN BABY MURDER
[0:35:30] <fugly_nick> What the shit is this

[0:36:32] <%MaritimeFox> Welp, dubbed is canon now.
[0:36:35] <JayEarly> it makes as much sense for Japanese dudes to speak the Queen’s English as any other kind really
[0:36:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> the chaos emeralds
[0:36:44] <artoflec> Dark Souls invented accents in the UK apaprently, god dark souls fans are dumb
[0:36:45] <cheapdoc> Is this elden ring?
[0:36:47] <%maskofmichael> AN ENEMY STAD?
[0:36:49] <@ssjklyco> literally did nothing wrong

[0:36:53] <cartakus> Dumb sword woolie hates
[0:36:54] <Treasure_Vault> dragon balls
[0:36:55] <+SliceOfGouda> Not the village youth!
[0:36:57] <cheapdoc> Is this Anor Londo?
[0:36:57] <%PatchTheSquid> did someone really just say "dark souls accents"?!
[0:37:01] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> To be fair he was being attacked first, he had every right to kill those pussyass villagers
[0:37:01] <%YakumoYomi> @pokefan9956 Kotick's not giant Kappa
[0:37:03] <signofzeta> gosh, this makes me miss Onimusha

[0:37:39] <whimwhisp> So is this the heroic tail where racism wins? Those villagers were dicks ;p
[0:37:40] <+JustToWatch> I think that guy is evil

[0:37:49] <%YakumoYomi> Legally Distinct Sharingan
[0:37:50] <Hamborgini> getting stabbed in the throat as a kid is a pretty good excuse for a silent protagonist

[0:39:42] <%valriot> LUL LUL
[0:39:43] <%patriotrenegade> How?
[0:39:43] <%maskofmichael> coward
[0:39:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> the seven branched sword (shichishito) is a historical artifact, and despite it being  iconically Japanese it was a gift from a korean king
[0:39:43] <@PrefectusCorgi> Sussy Cheater
[0:39:47] <%JoshManVGH> Otherwise the armor looks goofy in some games
[0:39:47] <Captbutt> what happened?
[0:39:47] <%MaritimeFox> Oof
[0:39:48] <Hamborgini> oh damn, yeah DD will do that
[0:39:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> This game has a really good character creator tho
[0:39:50] <theshillman> LUL LUL LUL
[0:39:51] <Nickhead93> go fists
[0:39:52] <%PocketBearIllustrator> why can't more games have good beard options?
[0:39:53] <%YakumoYomi> Baby Arisen
[0:39:54] <%SvenHolgersson> Teensy Cheater
[0:39:55] <%JoshManVGH> Too light?
[0:39:55] <+SilverDevilfish> Xenoverse was the worst for that
[0:39:57] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> What if there was a game that gave bonuses to short character?
[0:39:58] <whimwhisp> what happens in DD?
[0:39:59] <%Bt_Robot> What happened?
[0:40:00] <+WildcardM> dragons dogma said "lol, lmao."
[0:40:00] <%tank7013> At least you could fit through small holes
[0:40:03] <%dekkitout> Did the camera sandbag you?
[0:40:03] <+bugz_munny> DD be like that
[0:40:04] <+D00msDayDan> the trick is to be tall enough to pick up and throw your own pawn
[0:40:05] <taylorpony> Bovune-San
[0:40:08] <KaironFortressKnight> The music here is really nice
[0:40:09] <+Tucker0603> too short
[0:40:10] <scrumbotime> In dragon's dogma, I gamed the system for stamina and reach by making a crazy long thin man, so I had thin speed and stretch armstrong limbs
[0:40:10] <%RayReborne> yeah Hold that L Pat Kappa
[0:40:11] <penitentpendant> Dragon's Dogma: "You MUST be joking with this height, so we'll laugh with you!"
[0:40:12] <cartakus> To be fair height matters in that game and ONLY that game
[0:40:13] <%SovPho> You can't use some weapons if you're too small I think
[0:40:13] <+SliceOfGouda> i must go check my meatloaf, i dont want to burn my house down today
[0:40:14] <Hamborgini> sway da dwagon, awizen
[0:40:15] <%RyTYoung> big tree time
[0:40:17] <%Bluwizard21> but you can take him
[0:40:19] <+Tucker0603> can't reach certain places
[0:40:19] <+alphonseisbest> @onethousandtomatoes that's a GOOD ASS gift then
[0:40:20] <%JoshManVGH> Good plan
[0:40:25] <%dalmek> here's your weapon test room
[0:40:27] <+coolthulhuu> punch build punch build
[0:40:28] <+AngryHomunculus> Are you playing this on PC or PS5?
[0:40:29] <Captbutt> @SovPho no fucking way
[0:40:30] <theshillman> tell us what dragons dogma did to you pat LUL
[0:40:33] <cartakus> FISTING TIME
[0:40:36] <+McSoliace> instead you'll spend it on finding a suitable weapon
[0:40:36] <%justcallmebobplease> @SilverDevilfish I've heard a bunch of good stuff about Xenoverse 2 - have you played that enough to comment?  For Dragonball fans, is it worth playing through, do you think?
[0:40:36] <President_valentine> weapons test
[0:40:36] <%Vextalyst> Pat's using my character. Internet clout here I come
[0:40:37] <cricket42069> take the gun and the flamethrower, hot it
[0:40:39] <Captbutt> fists are so good
[0:40:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> Fist Bonus
[0:40:40] <%RayReborne> FUN WEAPON ALERT
[0:40:43] <+Axellogic> to be fair you didnt stream long that day
[0:40:43] <%PocketBearIllustrator> oh, yeah, DD basically punished me for creating my big bara husbandos
[0:40:44] <%YakumoYomi> Jan Lee's moveset?
[0:40:44] <JayEarly> the only major flaw with this character creator is that you’re stuck with a weird flat butt no matter what
[0:40:45] <+aWanderingKaivo> Nioh 2 aw yeh
[0:40:47] <Nickhead93> now tonfas
[0:40:49] <cheapdoc> Do a tetsuzanko
[0:40:50] <Shwepie> For those wondering: Dragon's Dogma has some stats based on height and weight of a character, including movement speed and carry weight.
[0:40:51] <illtima> Fists Mid stance is exactly the same as Momiji's in DOA
[0:40:51] <+McSoliace> fists are rad
[0:40:52] <%Agami23> im guessing no magic this time?
[0:40:52] <fugly_nick> Doing some Breaker style moves here
[0:40:53] <%volitzern> So glad I didn't miss it this time lol If you have any questions, I know way too much 😂
[0:40:55] <anAngryHamster> It wasn't even a full boss
[0:40:55] <TheSpoonyBard27> Do you own the dlc?
[0:40:57] <President_valentine> Funnest weapon in the game
[0:40:58] <%patriotrenegade> No, seriously, what does Dragon's dogma do to short chracters @PatStaresAt
[0:40:58] <%MooseIsGoose> Very fun weapon
[0:40:59] <%Akizea> fists are so goddamn fun
[0:40:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> ass beatin time
[0:41:04] <%RayReborne> dodge then attack with the different stances Kappa
[0:41:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh look it's the "I can't believe woolie isn't playing this game" weapon
[0:41:08] <%MooseIsGoose> I did fist and spear
[0:41:10] <+coolthulhuu> the most fun
[0:41:14] <%MaritimeFox> Choose the sword or the ball!
[0:41:15] <+aWanderingKaivo> what's the specific mind goblin this time, just Nioh's crazy item system?
[0:41:19] <%JoshManVGH> Glaive is fun to fuck around with
[0:41:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> is there an actual punch option?
[0:41:21] <KaironFortressKnight> 1Katana + Fist for Vergil
[0:41:23] <%MaritimeFox> BFS, eh?
[0:41:25] <%valriot> Good pairing
[0:41:25] <%Broand> what of kusarigama
[0:41:27] <@GeneralSCPatton> Odachi mains unite!
[0:41:29] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @JayEarly 0/10, literally unslappable
[0:41:30] <%Djinnazz> Fists is the newest shit.
[0:41:30] <scrumbotime> .... when did they add Punch, or is that just literally no weapon out counts if you try
[0:41:33] <cartakus> @mooseisgoose Height can affect carry weight
[0:41:33] <%justcallmebobplease> @aWanderingKaivo The mind goblin is not completing the prior game.
[0:41:34] <Reisadan> ODACHI KUDASAI
[0:41:36] <cricket42069> are there people who don't pick this exact combo
[0:41:37] <+TopTieramisu> FIST YEYEYE
[0:41:37] <%MooseIsGoose> Try the others for fun I think staff and scyth are new
[0:41:39] <Hamborgini> @aWanderingKaivo skipping nioh 1 to play nioh 2 instead
[0:41:44] <%TheWinged7> oh no, pats a filthy longsword main
[0:41:45] <+aWanderingKaivo> ah ok that makes sense
[0:41:45] <+coolthulhuu> same i picked lol. staff is also great
[0:41:46] <%RayReborne> Switchglaive bro!
[0:41:46] <%SovPho> @SovPho i'm lying but movement speed is significantly affected by height in Dragon's Dogma as well as weapon reach
[0:41:48] <%RayReborne> try it
[0:41:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> all the weapon types are pretty sick
[0:41:51] <+HefestoForges> switchblade or no balls
[0:41:51] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt The fists are fucking great good choice
[0:41:52] <artoflec> Fists have some really unique shit that no other weapon can do
[0:41:52] <+Axellogic> I always focus stamina first so I can wear heavy armor
[0:41:52] <%JoshManVGH> Big weapon and when it doubt, punch out, that's solid
[0:41:55] <Captbutt> das a bloodborne
[0:41:56] <theshillman> hatchets got throwing attacks, that's pretty baller
[0:42:01] <+KBGuilty> Big dumb scythe is great
[0:42:04] <SilverFaustX> its the 21th day on the 21th year of the 21th century.
[0:42:05] <%Savarro> The fists are SO GOOD
[0:42:05] <%Vextalyst> @PatStaresAt That's the same build I used and it's great because they both scale off strength
[0:42:10] <+Local16> Love me some hatchets and fists tbh
[0:42:11] <+MajesticDoogle> the fact that they just slapped some Ninja Gaiden moves in the fist tree owns so hard
[0:42:14] <+SilverDevilfish> @justcallmebobplease If you're a dragonball fan it's worth it but it has a lot of things that don't make sense for a fangame like armor having stats, height, weight, and even gender also effecting stats. It's fun for the what if stuff but otherwise it's a pretty meh game.
[0:42:15] <nuane> no bad choices
[0:42:16] <+Tucker0603> my first weapons were axe and hatchets. full axe
[0:42:17] <GhoulishCripple> hatchet has free projectiles
[0:42:17] <%CalderGaming> lab room
[0:42:19] <+Axellogic> @artoflec true for most weapons
[0:42:25] <%valriot> PHANTOM
[0:42:27] <cartakus> Literally does not matter
[0:42:29] <+bravofifeniner> Its the worst
[0:42:30] <@Lion_kun> Try the nunchucks
[0:42:36] <@Lion_kun> Best counter
[0:42:36] <+HefestoForges> phantom
[0:42:37] <%PatchTheSquid> Phantom
[0:42:37] <%twistedj3ster> Gear 4
[0:42:37] <+StrikeTheErf> I like the speed one, the dash counter feels good
[0:42:37] <%RayReborne> big slow, get hit out of it easier
[0:42:37] <shiny_prinny> personally I use Feral most of the time
[0:42:38] <%valriot> Phantom is just Royal Guard,. easiest to understand
[0:42:38] <+aWanderingKaivo> @scrumbotime weapon added in dlc  iirc
[0:42:38] <Hamborgini> I really like phantom, but it's hard to get used to
[0:42:40] <+darethsbane> doesn't matter you get the others
[0:42:40] <Captbutt> anything but the magic one
[0:42:41] <%JoshManVGH> Depends on what dodge you eant
[0:42:41] <KaironFortressKnight> Decide based on the parry
[0:42:41] <+SliceOfGouda> go SPEED
[0:42:41] <%JokerNewby> You are not locked in
[0:42:42] <@Lion_kun> Easiest counter oni
[0:42:43] <+alphonseisbest> why not try sythe?
[0:42:44] <%PMAvers> Honestly, I liked the wolf if just because it was good at interrupts
[0:42:44] <%Djinnazz> charge it\
[0:42:44] <+Dova573> I preffer speed for Flash steps
[0:42:45] <%MooseIsGoose> wolf is my fav for counter
[0:42:45] <sirrice77> i would pick the one with the counter you like the most
[0:42:46] <%SovPho> @PatStaresAt Brute has like the best counter because you just get maximum super armor.
[0:42:46] <+WildcardM> strength has cool parry
[0:42:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> I barely touched any of this shit
[0:42:46] <%justcallmebobplease> @SilverDevilfish The stats and genderlock I'm familiar with from the first game - but weight?  Can you explain that more?
[0:42:46] <Shwepie> @SovPho Reach isn't that big of a problem. Can be nice though.
[0:42:47] <fugly_nick> Pull my Oni trigger
[0:42:48] <+SpiritRoads> you'll end up using them all but speed and phantom are good counters
[0:42:48] <odnucaf3> Here is my advise! Blue Bar magic Actions does not consume stamina.
[0:42:48] <+StrikeTheErf> you dash into attacks to parry with Feral
[0:42:48] <+KBGuilty> Brute is probably the easiest to use overall
[0:42:48] <AllenDeadman> BECOME KISHIN
[0:42:48] <+bravofifeniner> Feral or Phantom
[0:42:49] <+Local16> Do that one because it's parry will be the easiest for you to learn
[0:42:53] <+Axellogic> Do dog cause the brute form is easiest counter to use
[0:42:53] <Forulkan> i find phantom counter easiest, but it's just down to preference
[0:42:54] <+alphonseisbest> also Go with what I think is cool
[0:42:58] <taylorpony> Doggo brute
[0:42:59] <illtima> BRUTE - Easiest to use Counters. The other two are more situational, but stronger in those situations.
[0:43:00] <+coolthulhuu> but its so coool
[0:43:04] <@Lion_kun> Brute has the best parry
[0:43:07] <$bcdenton> hold triangle
[0:43:07] <artoflec> the new mechanic is kind of more what you want to decide imo
[0:43:08] <+secretspud> Uuse the Bluue one
[0:43:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> sharks tho
[0:43:10] <BepBepAmShep> I forget, does the shark still have enemy sense in this one?
[0:43:11] <+OperatorPlease> i love that speed
[0:43:11] <CunnymobileBrakeFluid> the phantom, exterior like fish egg
[0:43:12] <%codedoomboy> And parry is easy too land
[0:43:12] <+aWanderingKaivo> the most important thing about the yokai form is what kind of burst counter it has
[0:43:15] <%Savarro> Feral has the most satisfying counter
[0:43:15] <cricket42069> brute easiest to use but you take damage when you use it
[0:43:15] <%chill_o_wisp> the phantom's my fave
[0:43:16] <DeathByPoke7> BURD
[0:43:16] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> It's super easy to parry with Brute, @patstaresat .
[0:43:19] <%PocketBearIllustrator> ok, so question: how did DSP had an easier time with Nioh 1 than Dark Souls?
[0:43:20] <+coolthulhuu> this is my fav tbh
[0:43:20] <illtima> Also you can get other Spirit types as you progress
[0:43:20] <%SovPho> Phantom requires really precise parrying. Feral just eats damage most of the time but deals huge damage. Brute has the best counter and you can just power through attacks.
[0:43:21] <$bcdenton> Hold heavy attack
[0:43:22] <cartakus> Oh hey vergil
[0:43:22] <fugly_nick> I like the big club one the best
[0:43:24] <+Dova573> Dodge
[0:43:24] <%MaritimeFox> Kingdom Hearts I would make this choice matter.
[0:43:24] <primaryfire> feral has dodge offset
[0:43:25] <taylorpony> Magic birb
[0:43:28] <%valriot> Youre mostly picking these for their burst counter, of which Phantom is by far te best
[0:43:28] <chimeraxmachina> Ok but purple?
[0:43:28] <+SliceOfGouda> FAST
[0:43:29] <+SilverDevilfish> @SilverDevilfish Height and weight effect speed and HP if I remember correctly. The original also did this.
[0:43:32] <@GeneralSCPatton> Each one has a different way to counter enemy supers. Brute's is easiest, with a preemptive gut punch.
[0:43:33] <cricket42069> people seem to recommend feral
[0:43:36] <Hamborgini> feral gives you an extra, invincible dodge, which comes in handy
[0:43:40] <%RayReborne> look its PoP 3 Dark Prince Kappa
[0:43:42] <+TopTieramisu> i prefer the feral
[0:43:44] <odnucaf3> Here my other advise! Mikiri Counter everything like in Sekiro.
[0:43:44] <%MooseIsGoose> Brute has best counter
[0:43:45] <taylorpony> Dexy boi
[0:43:47] <+aWanderingKaivo> brute is an interrupt, phantom is like a dodge parry thing, phantom is a block that parries essentially
[0:43:48] <triangularblasphemy> Feral is my preference, but Brute has some really potent parrying
[0:43:49] <amiavamp> Feral lets you dodge cancel out of everything
[0:43:51] <+TopTieramisu> feral's counter is too good
[0:43:53] <+WildcardM> brute has BIG PARRY
[0:43:54] <%JokerNewby> you can change later
[0:43:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> different guardian spirits have DIFFERENT PARRIES so, the red one is an interrupt parry, the yeloow one is a weird dash parry, and the blue one you don't like is a press button just before you get hit parry. Thing is, you can only get a blue one a couple missions in
[0:43:56] <%SovPho> BRUTE is the easiest, feral is "stronger."
[0:43:58] <+HellCopter> Feral hard carried me with that dodge!
[0:44:01] <%skrewarrior> I like the shark
[0:44:02] <artoflec> Feral can also dodge while you're stunned
[0:44:03] <+aWanderingKaivo> er wait
[0:44:04] <%PatchTheSquid> Brute is easy parry Feral is Dodge Phantom is high damage parry
[0:44:04] <triangularblasphemy> Brute also overwhelms enemy guard
[0:44:07] <%SovPho> It's a react prompt.
[0:44:07] <anAngryHamster> Pat you *** just want big.number so pick brute
[0:44:07] <triangularblasphemy> R2 O
[0:44:08] <cartakus> @pocketbearillustrator He used a busted build in main game that got nerfed in dlc. He them quit the dlc
[0:44:09] <shiny_prinny> R2 + O
[0:44:09] <+aWanderingKaivo> FERAL is the dodge parry
[0:44:10] <+Dova573> Tutorial will teach you
[0:44:11] <GhoulishCripple> R2 Dodge
[0:44:11] <amiavamp> Tutorial should say
[0:44:12] <%valriot> R2 + O
[0:44:14] <+JustToWatch> it will show you in tutorial
[0:44:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> it'll teach you
[0:44:17] <+Axellogic> r1 and circle
[0:44:17] <+jierisu> dont worry you get to use all of them as you play
[0:44:18] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Counter is R2+ O
[0:44:19] <%PatchTheSquid> R2 + O
[0:44:22] <odnucaf3> R2 + Circle
[0:44:23] <%AgniBrandt> That's it yup
[0:44:23] <artoflec> the tutorial will run you through it yeah
[0:44:24] <triangularblasphemy> Yessir
[0:44:25] <+Axellogic> Oh yeah r2 circle
[0:44:27] <%MooseIsGoose> They will show you in tutorial
[0:44:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> theres a big fat tutorial
[0:44:31] <+StrikeTheErf> yes, with feral you basically dash into the attack to parry
[0:44:32] <%Vextalyst> @PatStaresAt They are very situational Brute is best preemptive, Phantom is best parry and Feral is inbetween
[0:44:33] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> attack enemies
[0:44:34] <triangularblasphemy> Yup it aint free
[0:44:34] <+SpiritRoads> fight
[0:44:34] <+HellCopter> It cancels out of literally anything
[0:44:36] <GhoulishCripple> if you land the parry
[0:44:36] <%Djinnazz> hittin shit
[0:44:37] <+StrikeTheErf> purple juice is from fight
[0:44:37] <triangularblasphemy> KILL
[0:44:37] <+Tucker0603> attack
[0:44:37] <illtima> You hit enemies
[0:44:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> just by attacking
[0:44:38] <%JoshManVGH> Hit stuff
[0:44:39] <shiny_prinny> hit things
[0:44:40] <%PMAvers> Smackin' stuff gives you purple juice back
[0:44:40] <+darethsbane> just by fighting things
[0:44:41] <GhoulishCripple> you get purple juice
[0:44:41] <%SovPho> You hit shit
[0:44:41] <%Agami23> beating on enemies
[0:44:41] <amiavamp> All the yokai stuff is R2 + something
[0:44:42] <President_valentine> Beat up enemies
[0:44:43] <+Tucker0603> HIT BITCHES
[0:44:43] <artoflec> so the brute counter has a startup
[0:44:44] <+HefestoForges> kill shit
[0:44:45] <Hamborgini> purple juice comes back in combat really quickly, don't worry about it too much
[0:44:47] <+HellCopter> Easily
[0:44:48] <+Axellogic> purple comes back from fighting
[0:44:48] <+AntithesisEK> Anima naturally returns from combat, bonuses and killing yokai with a finisher
[0:44:49] <%valriot> Feral is Trickster, Phantom is Royal Guard, Brute is a guard crush
[0:44:49] <odnucaf3> It is like Mikiri Counter from Sekiro.
[0:44:50] <%RayReborne> Ki pulse yokai realms
[0:44:50] <%skrewarrior> KILL
[0:44:52] <%Bt_Robot> Dud it's just spartan rage
[0:44:52] <%Djinnazz> @triangularblasphemy not yet anyway
[0:44:55] <+aWanderingKaivo> tutorial will spawn an enemy for practice
[0:44:59] <%Savarro> Feral you dodge INTO the attack to counter, takes a bit of positioning per enemy depending on their attack
[0:44:59] <+Axellogic> there also items and stuff for it
[0:45:08] <primaryfire> the utility of the counter kinda depends on the attack, if it's something with a long windup then the brute counter can interrupt it but feral and phantom have to wait for the attack to become active
[0:45:10] <Reisadan> Turn on the detailed numbers for the health bars and such
[0:45:16] <artoflec> Phantom's is instant, its Royal Guard, if you're off, it drains all your ki
[0:45:16] <odnucaf3> Purple Juice is like TP in RPGs.
[0:45:20] <%PMAvers> I do love that it's blatantly obvious when you can interrupt things.
[0:45:24] <%JoshManVGH> Vlariot has a good example
[0:45:29] <%volitzern> Also, you are not locked in to what you pick for long lol
[0:45:34] <DeathByPoke7> Super beast counter
[0:45:35] <KaironFortressKnight> Pat it says Burst
[0:45:35] <+HefestoForges> can't read LUL
[0:45:36] <+Tucker0603> BURST COUNTER
[0:45:37] <majindusto> BEAST?
[0:45:42] <odnucaf3> Burst Counter is the Best!
[0:45:50] <+Dova573> Btw this mechanic is totally in Stranger of Paradise
[0:45:51] <nuane> I gotta focus im shifting into yokai mode
[0:45:51] <+Local16> Ah yes Nioh 2's BEAST COUNTER
[0:45:52] <%PatchTheSquid> Pimp hand
[0:45:53] <triangularblasphemy> Some attacks are much better to knock down with Brute, some are better for Feral. Feral is more about actually parrying, Brute is about "stuffing" the attack
[0:45:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> Timely Press
[0:45:54] <Hamborgini> Castle Superburst
[0:45:57] <fugly_nick> Big number
[0:46:05] <+RobertWayneLewis98> What's "skipping entries?"
[0:46:07] <+pectusumbra> I mean that is cool regardless.
[0:46:07] <%PatchTheSquid> Brute keeps it's pimp hand strong
[0:46:25] <odnucaf3> Man Nioh2 and TheSurge2 are so good!
[0:46:25] <cricket42069> @RobertWayneLewis98 in this case, skipping Nioh 1
[0:46:30] <%Agami23> there are some enemies that are easier to counter with different yokai counters obviously
[0:46:30] <cartakus> Bitch slap dome demons
[0:46:34] <jetstreamlove_R> Nioh 2 is like if dark souls started dating DMC/Bayonetta
[0:46:35] <amiavamp> that gaki got pulped
[0:46:39] <%Savarro> Burst counter is the best thing added in Nioh 2 by far. Fucking game changer
[0:46:39] <+KBGuilty> hold r2 for big hammer
[0:46:40] <%justcallmebobplease> @RobertWayneLewis98 Skipping prior games in a series, such as say skipping Dark Souls 2 to go from 1 to 3.
[0:46:45] <KaironFortressKnight> Hold triangle Pat
[0:46:48] <Reisadan> yeah, never have to play part 1 of either game
[0:46:52] <+aWanderingKaivo> I like brute because I'm bad at the timing for the others tbh, though some counterable attacks come out too fast for brute
[0:46:53] <triangularblasphemy> Quite strong
[0:46:56] <+RobertWayneLewis98> oohhhh, that seems like a big one
[0:47:17] <nuane> bonk
[0:47:18] <%Dakuu75> I hope Pat as fun. (I fon't like Nioh 1 Pat.)
[0:47:19] <%SovPho> Music sound kinda warbly to anyone else?
[0:47:33] <GhoulishCripple> feral is hard to land because you need to really know your spacing and have decent aim
[0:47:36] <jetstreamlove_R> yeah sounds getting warped
[0:47:40] <%Djinnazz> @SovPho refresh
[0:47:42] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah brute form specific
[0:47:44] <+Tucker0603> only for brute
[0:47:47] <%SovPho> did
[0:47:51] <+Axellogic> only when in shift
[0:47:53] <cartakus> It's weird how your chest gets so wide for demon male but not female
[0:48:01] <Hamborgini> I'm in NG++ and I didn't realize that move existed
[0:48:03] <+OperatorPlease> warbly might be low latency mode, see if thats on
[0:48:04] <KaironFortressKnight> I forgot that even exists
[0:48:06] <%codedoomboy> Only for brute
[0:48:16] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt You can do a yokai grapple directly out of a beast counter even if you're not yokai shifted! It's sick when you manage it.
[0:48:19] <Treasure_Vault> this fucker fucks
[0:48:20] <+aWanderingKaivo> swift birb
[0:48:22] <+RobertWayneLewis98> bird
[0:48:24] <%SovPho> yeah I think that was it thanks
[0:48:26] <+RobertWayneLewis98> up
[0:48:26] <%Dakuu75> Pull my devil trigger
[0:48:29] <+HellCopter> Feral is badass
[0:48:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> its pretty cool
[0:48:33] <jetstreamlove_R> that's the naruto form
[0:48:35] <+Axellogic> @cartakus it does increase your bust size signifigantly if you set them small
[0:48:38] <+secretspud> Blue one rules
[0:48:39] <DeathByPoke7> what
[0:48:42] <+HefestoForges> words
[0:48:43] <%DianaTheAscian> oh shit this game had DT???
[0:48:43] <primaryfire> I never did that lol
[0:48:43] <%PatchTheSquid> *Burst counter
[0:48:45] <nuane> those sure are words
[0:48:45] <cheapdoc> Those sounded like a lot of nouns
[0:48:46] <jorniev> so what like an izuna drop?
[0:48:51] <+haitakaa> but only if you're wearing your Yokai Watch
[0:48:51] <cs0402196> why didn't they just make the voice super deep and gravelly when in yokai?
[0:48:52] <%AgniBrandt> Burst counter, oop
[0:49:01] <%PMAvers> Ah, so like a Pyke stun.
[0:49:04] <%zeroarturia> Bang bang pull my yokai triggger
[0:49:05] <odnucaf3> That Youkai  transformations looks a lot like Luffy Gear 4th.
[0:49:06] <cartakus> Buf if you are already hitomi it up....
[0:49:06] <President_valentine> You can get an Izuna drop in this game
[0:49:12] <+aWanderingKaivo> I think what they mean is if you yokai shift instead of hitting the grapple button like you normally would on someone out of ki
[0:49:13] <+Axellogic> dodge into attack
[0:49:15] <GhoulishCripple> if you land a counter hit and it empties the enemy stamina you can do the yokai form reposte for free
[0:49:26] <+StrikeTheErf> it's nice because it also works like a normal dodge
[0:49:27] <amiavamp> Feral shift form does kind of low damage, but you lose TONS of meter when you get hit in yokai shift, so the easy dodging makes up for it
[0:49:41] <%Dakuu75> honestly, I'd just pick the one that looks the coolest, lol
[0:49:42] <TranquiloArman> Feral has the most precise timing iirc
[0:49:43] <+Axellogic> it has to be on enemy active frames
[0:49:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah brute's the interrupt so you do it way earlier than feral
[0:49:49] <+HellCopter> It's also a great "oh shit" dodge since it cancels everything
[0:49:51] <$lotharrio> So which goblins are we battling tonight? Stat obsession or that first optional boss?
[0:49:55] <artoflec> oh man this one paralyzes thats kinda nice lol
[0:49:57] <%Savarro> Feral you gotta know which attack the enemy's gonna do and have the timing down but when you nail it it FUCKS
[0:49:57] <+Axellogic> Brute you can just smack them whenever
[0:50:00] <%Blank9> I like the brute because yeah, it's using an attack to interrupt them out of it
[0:50:03] <%Blank9> so you can do it super early
[0:50:06] <+aWanderingKaivo> @lotharrio playing 2 without finishing 1
[0:50:12] <+rafaelba93> slowly now guys, ita a rain of information
[0:50:15] <$lotharrio> Ah
[0:50:16] <@GeneralSCPatton> @lotharrio Several goblins, and not finishing the first game.
[0:50:24] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Yokai shift is literally DT. You really wish it would last longer
[0:50:30] <cartakus> Ghost type is the weird child
[0:50:34] <triangularblasphemy> This game has so many mechanics. It does, however, fuck
[0:50:35] <DXLelouch24> That sounds like a made up mind goblin
[0:50:36] <ahmz1404> You're probably not going to use form much
[0:50:38] <%PatchTheSquid> is anyone else's audio getting all warbly?
[0:50:42] <$lotharrio> Gotcha-gotcha, thanks @aWanderingKaivo  and @GeneralSCPatton
[0:50:45] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Feral nice
[0:50:48] <+StrikeTheErf> cancel attacks with dodge, cancel dodge with attack
[0:50:53] <JayEarly> is this dodge offset?
[0:51:00] <Hamborgini> @PatchTheSquid a little, here and there
[0:51:05] <+HefestoForges> you did the counter

[0:53:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's some bullshit
[0:53:08] <andrei1h1> fyi your starting weapons and spirit don't mean anything, you will get everything else as you play and stats don't mean much until like NG+3
[0:53:08] <+HellCopter> its a croissant
[0:53:08] <Reisadan> who came into your house
[0:53:15] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt The only problem I really had with this game is every cutscene has u with a katana rather than either of your weapons. They should have just made them all with the little knife instead
[0:53:18] <+aWanderingKaivo> I have never heard heard Tokichiro's english dub this is gonna be weird
[0:53:21] <amiavamp> prepare for Menus 2
[0:53:22] <ahmz1404> I meant the character
[0:53:22] <@GeneralSCPatton> It's just a Darksign

[0:53:34] <jetstreamlove_R> time to go super ninja build
[0:53:35] <+rafaelba93> every damn enemy in this game is least very resilient
[0:53:42] <Reisadan> It's time to download all those FREE SUPERIOR ARMORS
[0:53:43] <%MooseIsGoose> There are even more training missings if needed
[0:53:46] <triangularblasphemy> @Bluwizard21 Ended up switching to single katana for that reason (and because the combat instructor is a swordmaster)
[0:53:49] <%valriot> YEYEYE

[0:58:01] <President_valentine> Become a Hayabusa
[0:58:01] <%vVAstrAVv> its ok dlc gear is just glamour
[0:58:03] <+rafaelba93> your invetory is already clutered
[0:58:03] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt The FLC really doesn't boost you too much
[0:58:04] <theshillman> PUT ON THE VALVE HELMET!
[0:58:06] <%PMAvers> Ah, right, so you can make yourself look like the Nioh 1 character if you wanted.
[0:58:07] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> dragon ninja baybee
[0:58:10] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt The FreeLC ispretty weak and is more for fashion
[0:58:12] <Treasure_Vault> Equip the infinite ammo bandana
[0:58:13] <%epide> just wait for the text cuple of bosses the one from here is not that bad in comparison
[0:58:13] <ammobasket> Equip it ALL
[0:58:14] <cartakus> Some fuck hayabuda more like
[0:58:14] <%Blank9> they knew
[0:58:16] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah just equip that if nothing else lol
[0:58:16] <nuane> @RobertWayneLewis98 it's a pretty bad launcher and shopping experience, but a lot of the hate is Steam brand loyalty
[0:58:16] <amiavamp> they give you anti-goblin tech in this game
[0:58:18] <+Axellogic> The Free DLC isnt that strong its just okay gear youll get stronger stuff by mission end
[0:58:19] <%AgniBrandt> Kodama sensor is such a godsend
[0:58:20] <+HefestoForges> they're mostly low tier items tho so it's fine
[0:58:20] <RLT917> those items are only good at low level
[0:58:21] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Use it PAt
[0:58:24] <cricket42069> yeah the two accessories own
[0:58:30] <+aWanderingKaivo> it really is great
[0:58:30] <@PeachSaliva> Pat is so handsome what a handsome man
[0:58:30] <+RobertWayneLewis98> @SovPho makes more sense, pc store exclusives sounds weird to me also.
[0:58:31] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt and it's locked so you can't accidentally sell it
[0:58:33] <President_valentine> I love those little guys
[0:58:33] <%PatchTheSquid> Kodama sensor is the best
[0:58:36] <ammobasket> Do it!
[0:58:37] <cricket42069> kodama and treasure sensor is choice
[0:58:39] <%Dakuu75> does this game have a map?
[0:58:39] <President_valentine> they're adorable
[0:58:41] <%patriotrenegade> Sick Princess Mononoke referencew
[0:58:43] <@PeachSaliva> Show us your feet, round man
[0:58:45] <senfood> yeyeyeye
[0:58:45] <artoflec> LOL its so stupid i love it
[0:58:46] <jorniev> WOW thats a lot of starting gear
[0:58:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Kodama? Is that that fake country north of the US?
[0:58:47] <+coolthulhuu> ITS SO BAAAAD
[0:58:47] <%Vextalyst> @PatStaresAt another good thing is freelc is tied to your level when u get it so it's not OP
[0:58:50] <+HefestoForges> it's a keyboard
[0:58:51] <Hamborgini> that helmet is hilarious
[0:58:52] <cartakus> There is worse
[0:58:53] <%RayReborne> Sell that demon Garbo Kappa
[0:58:53] <+JustToWatch> it's so awful, I love it
[0:58:55] <@GeneralSCPatton> You can hide your helmet in settings
[0:58:55] <shiny_prinny> RGB samurai
[0:58:56] <odnucaf3> GAMER HAT!
[0:58:56] <%Blank9> they just wanted to give you something to use for every weapon type
[0:58:59] <%Dakuu75> omg... wtf is this shite-ass RGB gamer helmet shit
[0:59:01] <Reisadan> Look at the Ancient Rarity LCD Keyboard tho!
[0:59:03] <%tank7013> What's the matter you don't like the RGB keyboard helmet
[0:59:06] <%patriotrenegade> Kill One Million Demon
[0:59:06] <jorniev> GAMERS
[0:59:07] <theshillman> its a gamer keyboard LUL
[0:59:08] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> It's so Garish.
[0:59:14] <stormhawk9891> Million Demon set looks fucking dope
[0:59:16] <KatabolicRage> your gonna be fatrolling with this shit on man
[0:59:18] <+Axellogic> You wanna at least be in green weight
[0:59:20] <cricket42069> why walk when you can crawl?
[0:59:22] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Dakuu75 there's a minimap but its not very detailed at all, mostly you use it to see icons like from the kodama sensor Pat just equipped
[0:59:24] <%YakumoYomi> Is that the "We sold a bunch of copies" armor?
[0:59:26] <MyNameIsRasus> The ancient nipponese gamer
[0:59:34] <anAngryHamster> I think you're gonna have the fat roll with all that on
[0:59:35] <+JustToWatch> pretty sure you got the special odachi though
[0:59:40] <+rafaelba93> fists are aewsome
[0:59:40] <KaironFortressKnight> was that Rex
[0:59:41] <+RobertWayneLewis98> is that naruto
[0:59:44] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I see that Pat is using the best weapon, your fists
[0:59:46] <%patriotrenegade> Should've worked out more....
[0:59:55] <andrei1h1> use the dlc weapons and try to beat enemy #2 maybe?
[0:59:57] <%Djinnazz> eh
[1:00:06] <JetpackMcQuack> clever
[1:00:09] <jorniev> THATS a BEEG sword
[1:00:12] <%YakumoYomi> Just learn Japanese, Pat Kappa
[1:00:14] <jorniev> SWORD
[1:00:14] <+Axellogic> I think they use the same studio as FF14 for the VA in this
[1:00:21] <%MooseIsGoose> no fists or staff
[1:00:22] <%Savarro> Fists were dlc
[1:00:22] <jorniev> SFREELC
[1:00:22] <%RayReborne> Fists are dlc weapons technically
[1:00:23] <+SpiritRoads> fists weren't out yet
[1:00:23] <Captbutt> fists are dlc i think
[1:00:24] <%dalmek> fists and I think the staff were added later
[1:00:26] <%valriot> Fist and Staff were DLC
[1:00:27] <+jierisu> you can pick up fists later
[1:00:27] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Cuz fists were added later
[1:00:28] <+WildcardM> came out before the fists did
[1:00:29] <KaironFortressKnight> Fists didn't exist yet
[1:00:30] <+Axellogic> Demon Horde was before the first DLC
[1:00:31] <MyNameIsRasus> real demons don't use weapons when punching
[1:00:31] <shiny_prinny> the freelc probably came before the fist dlc
[1:00:32] <cricket42069> demons not allowed to punch
[1:00:36] <%AgniBrandt> Fists and splitstaff
[1:00:36] <+Tucker0603> @patstaresat and the staff since they were added later
[1:00:36] <+rafaelba93> its just marginaly better anyway
[1:00:37] <andrei1h1> fists didn't exist when this dlc was added I think
[1:00:37] <majindusto> NO FISTS lol
[1:00:47] <amiavamp> wrecked
[1:00:48] <%GIGA255> are you fighting your goblins by forcing yourself to use FreeLC?
[1:00:50] <+bugz_munny> curb stomp
[1:00:51] <Captbutt> step on child
[1:00:52] <+coolthulhuu> SEEEEEE\
[1:00:54] <%Blank9> originally the only new weapons were switch glaive and dual hatchets
[1:00:54] <+HefestoForges> yup
[1:00:56] <cartakus> Yeah that is about right
[1:00:57] <shiny_prinny> fuck yeah it does

[1:00:59] <cricket42069> stomp
[1:00:59] <+Tucker0603> FIST EM
[1:01:00] <+WildcardM> YEAH
[1:01:01] <%Savarro> Fists & Splitstaff were both dlc weapon types added later
[1:01:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> THE FISTS ARE GREAT IN THIS
[1:01:03] <jorniev> THATS SO SICK
[1:01:05] <@Lion_kun> WAYYY BETTER THAN NIOH 1
[1:01:05] <+HefestoForges> just wait until you get the shoulder tackle lol
[1:01:06] <+bugz_munny> curb stomp the children demons
[1:01:07] <%AgniBrandt> Fists are SO FUCKING GOOD

[1:01:16] <srv4254> ds2 cloak
[1:01:16] <Reisadan> Fight your goblins; unlock the FreeLC and EAT IT
[1:01:17] <Hamborgini> now you are a princess mononoke man
[1:01:17] <+JustToWatch> Fist special moves are the best
[1:01:17] <jorniev> ARMSTRONG
[1:01:19] <%Dakuu75> dude, why NOT use DLC weapons in games? they always get obsolete like 2 levels in?
[1:01:20] <%Blank9> I always had fists and and something else
[1:01:20] <DragonOfWarZro> Do combo
[1:01:20] <+rafaelba93> parrys are WAY easier btw
[1:01:21] <+RobertWayneLewis98> ITS HUGE
[1:01:21] <+Local16> Lowstance being Monkey stance is great on them
[1:01:22] <+KBGuilty> GOZUKI!!!!
[1:01:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> pnuch hors
[1:01:24] <+zanz_san> Fists are nuts
[1:01:25] <+Axellogic> Fists can combo infinitely
[1:01:28] <cricket42069> glhf
[1:01:29] <%Vextalyst> Fists are easily best weapons Have no idea how woolie has resisted skipping Nioh 1
[1:01:31] <@Lion_kun> Tonfa are great too
[1:01:36] <%volitzern> I was fisting before it was cool lmao
[1:01:36] <%SharkMissile> Mind Goblins :y
[1:01:37] <%Savarro> After the last Nioh stream I ran through 2 with the fists they're so fucking dopeeee
[1:01:40] <+rafaelba93> OHH NICE
[1:01:40] <+AngryHomunculus> Isn't that monster one of Kuze's tattoos?
[1:01:41] <artoflec> its a good enemy to just learn to fight cuz the save is right there too
[1:01:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> punch him a little at least
[1:01:46] <+Tucker0603> tonfas slap too
[1:01:47] <+aWanderingKaivo> btw remember that for your first run you can pretty much just care about attack and defense number go up, and try to stay at B agility and you'll be good
[1:01:48] <%RayReborne> Tonfa are pretty fun
[1:01:50] <%Blank9> HAVE to beat the asylum demon without weapons
[1:01:51] <Reisadan> But the key Pat, what about the key!?!?!?
[1:01:51] <%SovPho> I think you could do it with the brute counter
[1:01:53] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Fists are borderline busted
[1:01:59] <%volitzern> Glad they just made a weapon for it, the scroll thing was weird xD
[1:01:59] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.

[1:02:12] <theshillman> rekt
[1:02:14] <amiavamp> Dodging this guy is stupid, you have to do it so late that the mace is still going through you but the iframes save you
[1:02:17] <anAngryHamster> He has the key to that door
[1:02:17] <%Dakuu75> NOT dead in ONE hit... seems possible
[1:02:18] <+RobertWayneLewis98> yeh, kill that thing
[1:02:19] <%justcallmebobplease> @majindusto Pat does not understand (joke)
[1:02:20] <%SovPho> noice

[1:02:28] <+aWanderingKaivo> brute counter aw yeah
[1:02:34] <%MooseIsGoose> transform
[1:02:38] <%snow_bush> snow_bush subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! So pat, are there any weird, niche games you find yourself going back to play? I'm one of those weirdos playing Space Station 13
[1:02:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> pat is gaming?

[1:02:47] <senfood> LUL
[1:02:48] <%RayReborne> Kappa
[1:02:52] <nuane> the game is lying, you need to kill it right now
[1:02:53] <cartakus> Coward
[1:02:54] <cricket42069> quite good but the damage ain't there
[1:03:00] <majindusto> COWARD
[1:03:00] <%PMAvers> Just having a visual indicator of when you can actually interrupt things is SO nice
[1:03:01] <+jierisu> please god use low stance rn
[1:03:02] <%Savarro> Brute definitely has the easiest counter timing
[1:03:04] <%SovPho> Yeah it's definitely the better one for me
[1:03:06] <+TopTieramisu> pat using the joseph joestar secret technique
[1:03:06] <+RobertWayneLewis98> why is pat punching that child?
[1:03:09] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You can beat him more easily by the time you get to the end of the level
[1:03:11] <KaironFortressKnight> Unlock the door pat
[1:03:12] <%SovPho> I don't need damage from my counter in Nioh
[1:03:13] <@GeneralSCPatton> Gate is shortcut
[1:03:14] <%volitzern> There's a reason you get an achievement for killing him lol
[1:03:14] <+JustToWatch> open the gate first
[1:03:16] <sussy_baka_999> Brute is the only one I never use
[1:03:18] <+WildcardM> da gate
[1:03:18] <An_Ordinary_Fox> It's ok to back down -Game
[1:03:20] <+KBGuilty> open door
[1:03:22] <%MooseIsGoose> door can be unlocked
[1:03:22] <nuane> (he did not)
[1:03:23] <@PrefectusCorgi> Missed item
[1:03:23] <theshillman> pat shortcut
[1:03:25] <anAngryHamster> Easy mode is now selectable
[1:03:26] <+jierisu> high stance is waaay too much stamina in this stage
[1:03:26] <+Axellogic> Pat you missed shortcut
[1:03:28] <artoflec> this does sound like the FFXIV VA studio
[1:03:30] <+zanz_san> door
[1:03:31] <theshillman> pat pls
[1:03:34] <%Saadi90> Open gate!
[1:03:36] <+aWanderingKaivo> the counter does do damage, its just to ki :P
[1:03:37] <+SpiritRoads> pat missed 2 things
[1:03:37] <%Blank9> all stances cool
[1:03:39] <%RayReborne> DRUNKEN FIST FUCK YEAH
[1:03:47] <amiavamp> now the chat has goblins
[1:03:48] <+AntithesisEK> Pat I recommend trying out every weapon's High stance neutral heavy attack - dodge - heavy attack
[1:03:48] <+HefestoForges> blind
[1:03:49] <theshillman> oh no he gor airpod in he cant hear us
[1:04:01] <+RobertWayneLewis98> idk :)
[1:04:08] <Kalinflip> Doesn’t fuck harder than me
[1:04:08] <%captain_thickthighs> captain_thickthighs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Just wanted to say have a Merry Christmas. And also just to make you groan I actually made an Nft made 250 bucks. Finally Putting my BA to work.... after six years .
[1:04:09] <theshillman> it is very true
[1:04:09] <President_valentine> Where's your focus Kyle?
[1:04:13] <+Axellogic> YOu also misseda  kodama
[1:04:17] <+JustToWatch> there's also a Kodama before the bridge
[1:04:21] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt FYI When the lock-on indicator turns red you can go for a riposte/grab/etc.
[1:04:23] <%maskofmichael> Is the screen off by a pixel?
[1:04:24] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @artoflec if that's the case, the voice acting in general should at least be very good
[1:04:26] <+Orcapugs> Kodama sensor is going nuts
[1:04:38] <+HefestoForges> because you get specific skill points
[1:04:41] <KaironFortressKnight> Because you got a Samurai Skill Point
[1:04:43] <+darethsbane> all skill points are separate
[1:04:43] <+KBGuilty> Cuz your samurai leveled up
[1:04:44] <Who_lio42> ten everything!
[1:04:45] <%PMAvers> Samurai are generic between all weapons.
[1:04:48] <+McSoliace> points are separate
[1:04:48] <+JustToWatch> skill points are unique
[1:04:48] <GhoulishCripple> it's a samurai skill point
[1:04:49] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> you only have a samurai point
[1:04:49] <+Tucker0603> because they are exclusive to trees
[1:04:50] <+KBGuilty> all are tracked separatelly
[1:04:51] <+coolthulhuu> its elder scrolls style almsot
[1:04:51] <+HefestoForges> @PatStaresAt you get specific skill points
[1:04:53] <+Axellogic> I reccomdne learning the ki pulse on dodging in samurai
[1:04:54] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> all spheres are separate
[1:04:54] <+aWanderingKaivo> you get weapon skill points from using the weapon
[1:04:55] <+WildcardM> each dot has a specific skill
[1:04:56] <KaironFortressKnight> yeah
[1:04:56] <cartakus> Because it's a samurai skill point
[1:04:57] <iamnuff> Did Pat ever Try Ninjutsu in the first game?  It's reusable consumables.
[1:04:58] <%Blank9> every skill point is for that grid only
[1:05:00] <+Mooseification> each thing has its own exp bar
[1:05:03] <@GeneralSCPatton> Flux is great
[1:05:03] <scrumbotime> yep, skills are per-catagory
[1:05:14] <President_valentine> you get weapon skills by using that weapon
[1:05:14] <+rafaelba93> minimao kodamas goblin arriving
[1:05:15] <+pectusumbra> I heard you get specific points from doing the things in particular, like using a given weapon and the like
[1:05:18] <+aWanderingKaivo> those lead to ki pulse on dodge
[1:05:18] <theshillman> @iamnuff no pat had a fatal goblins meltdown
[1:05:25] <cricket42069> if they weren't specific i would have died irl 5m into this game
[1:05:25] <DragonOfWarZro> Do magic get magic
[1:05:25] <+WildcardM> low med high
[1:05:28] <Who_lio42> TEN CHI JIN
[1:05:28] <+bugz_munny> its ki pulse man
[1:05:30] <+Axellogic> Do the ki pulses in the stances first so you can ki pulse by dodging
[1:05:32] <%Blank9> so high/mid/low buffs when you ki puls
[1:05:32] <@GeneralSCPatton> Heaven, Man, and Earth are just weird terminology for the stances
[1:05:35] <GhoulishCripple> you can get to the point where you can ki pulse on a dodge and gain stamina and dodge at the same time
[1:05:35] <%PMAvers> So hitting perfect Ki Pulses will do different bonuses depending on stance.
[1:05:38] <cartakus> Hey it's like ffxiv ninja
[1:05:38] <+theuselessace> isn't that ten chi jin?
[1:05:42] <%volitzern> You will benefit heavily by picking a favorite stance.
[1:05:48] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt You are going to get a ton of skill points so don't fret about placing them
[1:05:54] <+JustToWatch> green dot on map
[1:05:57] <+HellCopter> That range
[1:05:58] <GhoulishCripple> green dots on minimap pat
[1:06:02] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> the green dot on the minimap is a kodama
[1:06:04] <KaironFortressKnight> My Kodama senses are tingling...
[1:06:12] <President_valentine> White flash means command grab
[1:06:21] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat you get skill points just by using the weapon in 2, their seperate from one another. So no more having to choose what weapon to use they each get their own points.
[1:06:35] <%barrakuta371> psaCaco
[1:06:45] <+Axellogic> We are officially past where Pat got previously :V
[1:06:47] <+JustToWatch> Pat loves fisting
[1:06:50] <%justcallmebobplease> Got a problem?
[1:06:51] <%justcallmebobplease> PUNCH IT
[1:06:54] <iamnuff> Beat-yo-ass no jutsu!
[1:06:54] <theshillman> fist busted
[1:06:54] <cricket42069> love the boof-splash sound effect on the fists
[1:06:55] <+HellCopter> I was big on unga-bunga high stance the whole game
[1:06:57] <DXLelouch24> You can switch comfortably
[1:06:57] <+Dova573> Also if you use ninjutsu you get ninja points and the same with magic
[1:06:59] <shiny_prinny> all new territory now
[1:07:10] <+HefestoForges> monkey time soon
[1:07:14] <%MelBrooksKA> Pat has become the romantic rubber fist
[1:07:17] <+rafaelba93> parrys are way easier once you unlock them btw
[1:07:20] <+swesterly> how is nioh 2? I loved the stamina mechanic in nioh but found the enemy variety and world building lacking. Is it a solid souls like?
[1:07:23] <+TopTieramisu> all these english ghosts in japan
[1:07:25] <Captbutt> don't be rude to the ghost man
[1:07:36] <+coolthulhuu> hers discovered the super kick spam
[1:07:37] <cartakus> Dual hatchets are the best
[1:07:38] <%RayReborne> backstab gone, boo
[1:07:40] <%Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt might wanna turn on auto pickup.
[1:07:42] <+coolthulhuu> he's^
[1:07:44] <+Axellogic> I still wish you started with backstab
[1:07:45] <%Blank9> those running high heavies
[1:07:52] <DXLelouch24> Nioh 2 is better than 1 in every single way

[1:09:08] <iamnuff> NPC friendo
[1:09:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Nioh 2 gives the player a lot more stuff, yet the enemies still don't care

[1:10:36] <+KBGuilty> Hey look its a Sol player
[1:10:41] <%justcallmebobplease> Uh oh
[1:10:50] <%Blank9> demons never regain stamina until it's broken too
[1:11:02] <amiavamp> When they're out of ki they lose their stagger resist and you can beat on their asses
[1:11:04] <%PMAvers> At least this guy doesn't respawn once you kill it.
[1:11:05] <illtima> MONKE
[1:11:07] <iamnuff> He's an Oni
[1:11:07] <+aWanderingKaivo> when their ki is all red like that its time to go in, because every hit will stagger
[1:11:08] <@PrefectusCorgi> GetGud
[1:11:10] <BigFingerRo> GRAB HIS DICK AND TWIST IT}
[1:11:10] <+RobertWayneLewis98> hes just vibin
[1:11:13] <%MooseIsGoose> he is one and done though
[1:11:14] <primaryfire> that's why the music is so intense
[1:11:14] <+JustToWatch> try high stance
[1:11:18] <cartakus> Not really
[1:11:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> you think you could kill a monkey that big?
[1:11:30] <+Dova573> You know now that I think of it, I would love for a Demon Slayer game in this style
[1:11:33] <+Axellogic> Brute is the easiest counter against these guys
[1:11:35] <%RayReborne> huh, he hasnt used it yet on Pat
[1:11:36] <%justcallmebobplease> OH
[1:11:36] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[1:11:37] <%justcallmebobplease> OH PAT
[1:11:37] <+RobertWayneLewis98> get rekt
[1:11:37] <+HefestoForges> oh boi
[1:11:38] <akitanito> just one pip
[1:11:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> monke
[1:11:40] <%justcallmebobplease> RIGHT THERE?
[1:11:41] <DXLelouch24> I did Fists/Tonfas on my playthrough
[1:11:42] <triangularblasphemy> Oof
[1:11:46] <knight_verse> His pattern is easy to learn, just dodge sideways then hit him during the opening.
[1:11:46] <+bugz_munny> 2
[1:11:47] <BigFingerRo> This is what happens when you don't do the ol dicktwist
[1:11:48] <%Blank9> mid heavy is a nice long reach stab
[1:11:50] <%facto905> psaDown
[1:11:50] <cricket42069> yeah, me too dude
[1:11:50] <cartakus> He is problably the most fair of the yokai
[1:11:51] <MicrotonalMatt> Monke is top tier tdogPiggy
[1:11:51] <+HefestoForges> yet
[1:11:53] <+critikal_bit> You're getting this Pat!
[1:11:54] <%RayReborne> yeah weird
[1:11:55] <Hamborgini> yeah, it was weird, too
[1:11:57] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah he just decided not to I guess
[1:11:58] <efratzy> stilll lowers stamina i believe
[1:12:02] <%Vextalyst> you got unlucky yeah
[1:12:05] <+rafaelba93> monkey FUCKS
[1:12:06] <Who_lio42> you can use the brute counter as an attack if you want
[1:12:07] <%vVAstrAVv> is this the 1st mission again?
[1:12:09] <+RobertWayneLewis98> nice run bro
[1:12:10] <iamnuff> Is he fucking naruto-running?
[1:12:10] <kozboz96> you can use it just as a raw extra hit too
[1:12:10] <%Savarro> Lots of enemies have proximity sensitive attacks. like the monke will throw the spear if you're far and slams down if you're close
[1:12:11] <+zanz_san> Yeah he's tough at first
[1:12:11] <%volitzern> I hate the monkeys with a passion xD
[1:12:11] <+JustToWatch> high stance can stagger easier
[1:12:13] <%valriot> BTW, low stance is more your bread n bread for Odachi
[1:12:17] <%vVAstrAVv> brutes ass phantoms best
[1:12:19] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt IIRC Brute counter can also be used as a stamina reducing attack
[1:12:21] <amiavamp> yeah brute counter can be a combo extender
[1:12:21] <zazutobi> Go high stance and break the horn with odachi
[1:12:25] <+Axellogic> Sometimes monkey dont, but the main reason he feels so tough is just cause of your gear
[1:12:26] <cartakus> Compared to tengu that thing is harmless
[1:12:27] <+coolthulhuu> gaki but yes actually
[1:12:35] <%PatchTheSquid> It's like DS where you have to be at the right range to bait out the red moves
[1:12:37] <%justcallmebobplease> @valriot It's bread n BUTTER, not bread n bread
[1:12:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Kappa
[1:12:43] <%volitzern> Hahaha xD
[1:12:43] <knight_verse> Man... I wish I had the dlc, those gauntlets look sick AF.

[1:12:55] <Captbutt> yeah that works
[1:12:57] <@Ranryu692> this game is almost unrecognizable compared to (early) Nioh lol
[1:13:02] <@GeneralSCPatton> Solid opener
[1:13:02] <+Axellogic> You dont have to hold the hammer that long
[1:13:02] <+Crunchy_the_clown> I hope he dies lol
[1:13:04] <%valriot> @valriot yeah my brain no go
[1:13:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah that works on most enemies LUL
[1:13:05] <iamnuff> Interesting tactics.
[1:13:06] <BigFingerRo> Oh wow, that's a HARD fuck
[1:13:06] <cartakus> That thing won't work every time though
[1:13:08] <+HefestoForges> @PatStaresAt when the weapon gets big it's done charging, no need to hold so much
[1:13:13] <+rafaelba93> dt doesnt kill a single enemy
[1:13:16] <President_valentine> Counter his Unga with your Bunga
[1:13:20] <KaironFortressKnight> We thought Pat was fighting a Gorilla, but it turns out he *was* the Gorilla
[1:13:23] <BigFingerRo> You got it!
[1:13:30] <cricket42069> "you and spy's fists are now friends"
[1:13:36] <+coolthulhuu> Clap
[1:13:37] <Who_lio42> blocking in mid stance costs the least stamina
[1:13:39] <DanXaliberc> good job wooo

[1:15:45] <+Crunchy_the_clown> attune it
[1:15:45] <%valriot> Yokai move
[1:15:46] <%tank7013> To be fair most of your goblins have been quelled already
[1:15:46] <@GeneralSCPatton> Attune
[1:15:46] <President_valentine> Attune it
[1:15:48] <cartakus> Kinda surprised so many people gave up on nioh 2 or never picked it up
[1:15:50] <%captain_thickthighs> a stand monkey
[1:15:50] <+aWanderingKaivo> resting rites is recycling
[1:15:50] <@Lion_kun> WE TOLD YOU IT WAS BETTER
[1:15:51] <+KBGuilty> Attune
[1:15:51] <zazutobi> Attune soul core to your guardian for ability.
[1:15:51] <+Stolen_ac> pokemon
[1:15:54] <%PMAvers> So basically you can slot them into your guardian to give you that move and the statss.
[1:15:56] <KaironFortressKnight> GOBLINS
[1:16:01] <KatabolicRage> you are soma cruz as someone said
[1:16:03] <%vVAstrAVv> @mixoops because hes woolie. he wont listen to requests till 10 years later
[1:16:04] <+critikal_bit> Yeah, Nioh 2 is head and shoulders above Nioh 1
[1:16:05] <tegas_> One of the strange things about this game is the story is pretty entertaining.
[1:16:05] <%Blank9> attune = equip it, then you can use it as a move
[1:16:07] <+RobertWayneLewis98> you can literally return to monke?
[1:16:07] <+UKOrigin> summons#

[1:16:26] <AoiRob> is that for like the devil trigger
[1:16:26] <%Blank9> you have a jump projectile now
[1:16:28] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Every single monster in the game has a chance to drop their souls too
[1:16:29] <+Dova573> THERE ARE SOME BUSTED ONES TOO
[1:16:29] <MicrotonalMatt> Materia
[1:16:32] <+HefestoForges> my character was Soma
[1:16:32] <+OperatorPlease> somebody play bloody tears
[1:16:33] <%captain_thickthighs> hes third eye is now opened
[1:16:33] <ghekre> Become MONKE
[1:16:34] <%zeroarturia> Aria of sorrow baby!
[1:16:37] <+Tucker0603> do stamina for health and equip load
[1:16:39] <CuttleCrow> psaHoldon
[1:16:49] <+aWanderingKaivo> stamina is equip load very good to lvl early
[1:16:49] <illtima> Stamina is WEIGHT
[1:16:53] <@GeneralSCPatton> Stamina = Life and Equip Load
[1:16:54] <Hamborgini> most stats affect a bunch of stuff
[1:16:55] <anAngryHamster> Purple bar is anima. It's what you use for enemy skills
[1:16:56] <+rafaelba93> i just lvl most shit
[1:16:57] <%MooseIsGoose> yes
[1:16:57] <+Axellogic> Stamina is mostly equip weight
[1:16:58] <andrei1h1> yes
[1:16:58] <+JustToWatch> yes
[1:16:58] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> yeah
[1:16:58] <BepBepAmShep> yeah
[1:16:58] <%valriot> Yes
[1:16:59] <%JoshManVGH> I like that the Fist stat also allows for heavy armor
[1:17:00] <+KBGuilty> Yup
[1:17:00] <+Dova573> yes
[1:17:00] <+HefestoForges> yes
[1:17:00] <%RayReborne> yes
[1:17:01] <amiavamp> Yeah you just buy respec items for gold
[1:17:02] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah
[1:17:02] <GhoulishCripple> yes
[1:17:02] <President_valentine> Don't worry too much Respecing is easy
[1:17:03] <%Savarro> Yup
[1:17:03] <%superc37> yeah
[1:17:04] <+coolthulhuu> easily
[1:17:04] <shiny_prinny> yeah you can respec
[1:17:05] <stormhawk9891> Yeah
[1:17:07] <%volitzern> Eventually
[1:17:07] <%JoshManVGH> Very respec
[1:17:08] <%Blank9> rounding out for early soft caps will never be a bad idea, and you can respec
[1:17:08] <%PatchTheSquid> Yeah
[1:17:08] <BepBepAmShep> pretty easy to do so, too
[1:17:12] <cartakus> YES
[1:17:13] <%PatchTheSquid> very easily
[1:17:15] <%vVAstrAVv> everything effects life to some degree
[1:17:15] <tegas_> As with Nioh 1 the stat allocation isn't as important as it seems because you minor upgrades across board with level ups.
[1:17:17] <%vVAstrAVv> yes
[1:17:17] <+Local16> It's super easy to respec later
[1:17:17] <+UKOrigin> @PatStaresAt get enough dex for the auto-life ninjutsu
[1:17:20] <zazutobi> Keep an eye on purple gauge below ki.
[1:17:22] <iamnuff> Pat am become Monke, thrower of spear
[1:17:23] <KatabolicRage> monke spear toss is yours
[1:17:23] <cricket42069> eek eek eek ook ook
[1:17:24] <artoflec> you can use Yokai moves when you're out of Ki and get stunned btw
[1:17:24] <+AntithesisEK> @PatStaresAt try giving standing High stance heavy attack, dodge, heavy attack a try.
[1:17:28] <+Axellogic> You just need books from blacksmith you wont unlock blacksmith for a bit though
[1:17:30] <MicrotonalMatt> tdogBruh
[1:17:32] <AoiRob> wait this game has the Soul System from Aria??
[1:17:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> he trow rocc :)
[1:17:36] <+UKOrigin> @PatStaresAt and enough magic for the def doWn debuff etc
[1:17:39] <+coolthulhuu> feels good dont it
[1:17:39] <%valriot> Honestly, for stas, bump stuff for comfort, then just blast into 2-3 main stats, probably strength and stamina
[1:17:40] <%RayReborne> FUCK YEEAAAH
[1:17:40] <%JoshManVGH> @ukorigin I'm sorry, the what?
[1:17:44] <@GeneralSCPatton> @artoflec I forgot about that
[1:17:45] <%Visorak6> "am I still playing nioh?"
[1:17:45] <DragonOfWarZro> Using yokai abilites charges your Yokai trigger faster than normal combat
[1:17:49] <+Crunchy_the_clown> Fists are OD
[1:17:49] <+Axellogic> YOu can respec individual skill trees at any time from the dojo on the map though
[1:17:50] <%PatchTheSquid> YEH YEH YEH YEH YEAAAHHHH
[1:17:57] <amiavamp> Odachi has one too
[1:17:59] <+UKOrigin> Which part josh lol
[1:17:59] <maskedmook> I had no idea what this game was before this stream but now I HAVE to get it
[1:18:03] <+AntithesisEK> Odachi's is a backflip and I love it
[1:18:03] <%Savarro> Nioh 2 is such an improvement in every way it completely invalidates the first game for me. And I love Nioh 1
[1:18:04] <+secretspud> this game is so god-damn crazy. I lost like 2 months to this at release
[1:18:05] <%Blank9> heavy attacks are legit
[1:18:16] <%RayReborne> hey Pat, High stance fist and do a dodge attack Kappa
[1:18:16] <KyroDragon> ye ye ye everyone play Nioh 2
[1:18:17] <scrumbotime> Also, you can unlock more skills by doing the dojo
[1:18:20] <BackflipCharm> Chat I need help. What was that weird isometric post apocalyptic game people kept hyping up but Pat played and hated?
[1:18:21] <%MooseIsGoose> yup
[1:18:24] <%valriot> Pretty much
[1:18:27] <TheChapyGuy> most of the stages from Nioh 1 are in here plus a bunch more
[1:18:27] <Hamborgini> some of the stages even come back in this one
[1:18:29] <+UKOrigin> :)
[1:18:30] <%Blank9> it has more and is better
[1:18:30] <TsunTsuchinoko> mostly
[1:18:31] <efratzy> less returning bosses than youd expect
[1:18:33] <GhoulishCripple> Nioh 2 has A LOT
[1:18:34] <odnucaf3> Exactly
[1:18:34] <+pectusumbra> I mean the only thing I can think of missing would be bosses from the first game?
[1:18:34] <+aWanderingKaivo> it does not do that but its a big game
[1:18:35] <%SharkMissile> This is mostly a prequel
[1:18:35] <+rafaelba93> you just miss loveble goo boss
[1:18:38] <+UKOrigin> ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,................7
[1:18:39] <CuttleCrow> ohhh no
[1:18:39] <cartakus> AND BETTER REDO OF BOSSES
[1:18:41] <%Savarro> Yuuuup
[1:18:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> or maybe I'm wrong lol
[1:18:43] <%RayReborne> as side mission zones mostly lol
[1:18:45] <illtima> There are a couple of NIoh 1 stages and bosses, but it's like 20% maybe
[1:18:45] <+Axellogic> Some of nioh 1 is in this but not all of it
[1:18:46] <GhoulishCripple> and the stage remixes are amazing
[1:18:48] <andrei1h1> and some old bosses were added here in the dlc
[1:18:50] <%Blank9> a lot of nioh 1 stages are optional sidequests
[1:18:50] <artoflec> eh, not invalidation they're both very worth playing
[1:18:51] <%vVAstrAVv> theres like 3 nioh 1 stages that return
[1:18:51] <ahmz1404> Many enemies are in this game but no not stages
[1:18:52] <%MooseIsGoose> better everything
[1:18:53] <+AntithesisEK> finally, nioh 1
[1:18:53] <grimwire1> well the side mission zones
[1:18:54] <+aWanderingKaivo> I didn't finish nioh 1
[1:18:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> also the enemy variety in this one is WAY bigger
[1:18:54] <tegas_> They don't have cool frog castle sadly.
[1:18:54] <+coolthulhuu> welcome to the true niohs
[1:18:55] <+UKOrigin> BUT WILLIAM, DONT YOU MISS HIM
[1:18:57] <+OperatorPlease> so this is a L4D2 situation
[1:18:57] <%tank7013> Yea pretty much. Unless you REALLY like William
[1:18:59] <+RobertWayneLewis98> sooo does this count as a mind goblins then? hmm
[1:19:01] <%tank7013> And even then
[1:19:05] <%RealThiele> welcome to Nu-nioh 1
[1:19:07] <%superc37> i deadass consider nioh 2's anima and soul core system to be better than sekiro's paper emblem system
[1:19:08] <President_valentine> I like William
[1:19:09] <%valriot> Mostly just side missions, but even some bosses are in this
[1:19:11] <%RayReborne> yeah only like 3.nioh 1 places from what i saw
[1:19:14] <jorniev> aw man i liked william
[1:19:15] <DragonOfWarZro> Just watch the cutscenes for nioh 1
[1:19:17] <GhoulishCripple> you can even play as Williem as a Character skin
[1:19:18] <+UKOrigin> ardbert?
[1:19:18] <%volitzern> Since it didn't seem to come up previously. Ninjutsu and Onmyo are item classes in a sense. You are heavily rewarded for using consumables, by unlocking refilling ones.
[1:19:19] <+TopTieramisu> i don't miss weeb geralt
[1:19:21] <silentshrug> i love being able to remake my character, booba at any time
[1:19:23] <zazutobi> Doing english voices? Bad british move.
[1:19:25] <%dalmek> @BackflipCharm Kenshi?
[1:19:26] <iamnuff> We told you bro. This is a much better game.
[1:19:29] <%superc37> there are still kodamas btw
[1:19:30] <+Crunchy_the_clown> HAs he found any KOdoma yet?
[1:19:31] <KatabolicRage> don't feel shy about using your yokai moves
[1:19:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Welcome to Neo Nioh
[1:19:50] <arizenarkana> Even Bioh 2 thinks you should skip Nioh 1.
[1:19:50] <%Savarro> This game is why I have faith in FF CHAOS and why I hope they make a Nioh 3 when they're done
[1:19:56] <maskedmook> THE PUNCHES ARE SO COOL
[1:19:57] <+RobertWayneLewis98> fist only run
[1:19:58] <jorniev> so what happened to that one spanish lady from nioh? or im missremembering?
[1:19:58] <+coolthulhuu> the characters are really fun in this game. all these historical figures got stands
[1:19:58] <President_valentine> IT'S  a really great move
[1:19:59] <JayEarly> was that a fucking dempsy roll?
[1:20:01] <+KBGuilty> Wait till BATTERING RAM
[1:20:01] <%Blank9> enemies with no ki stagger to any hit, and fists drain ki like mad
[1:20:07] <artoflec> well FF Chaos is the dissida NT team apapretnyl not hte Nioh team
[1:20:11] <%JoshManVGH> Nioh 1 destroyed, Nioh 2 is the game now!
[1:20:17] <%RealThiele> baby demons hate being punched
[1:20:18] <jetstreamlove_R> welcome to Streets Neoh!
[1:20:22] <+Dova573> FF CHAOS IS GONNA FUCK, if they fix the performance issues
[1:20:26] <ahmz1404> it makes me happy to see Pat enjoying Nioh
[1:20:26] <%RayReborne> @kbguilty yeyeyeyeyeye
[1:20:31] <GhoulishCripple> @patstaresat you get a lot of purple bar generation so don't feel shy with dodges and yokai attacks
[1:20:32] <BackflipCharm> @dalmek I think that's it! Thank you it was killing me
[1:20:36] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Savarro I think there was something about them making a romance of the 3 kingdoms themed game?
[1:20:36] <Treasure_Vault> Crazy to think the second half of the game is behind those rocks
[1:20:38] <%superc37> @jorniev you find out later in the game
[1:20:38] <Captbutt> yeyeye
[1:20:40] <artoflec> but FF chaos using stance switching as ..changing your job just makes perfect sense
[1:20:40] <jorniev> I WANT TO KILL CHAOS NOW
[1:20:41] <+KBGuilty> @RayReborne yeyeyeyeyeye
[1:20:43] <DragonOfWarZro> I still like elemental weapon more than Yokai shift
[1:20:45] <%MidnightPacif1c> believe it
[1:20:46] <+TopTieramisu> you mean boruto running?
[1:20:49] <jetstreamlove_R> Dattebayo motherfuckers!
[1:20:55] <%JoshManVGH> Dude that second demo of Ff Origins SiP fucking fucked
[1:20:56] <+Tucker0603> BELLY FLOP
[1:21:01] <%SharkMissile> You mean Boruto's Dad Running?
[1:21:04] <AoiRob> you mean boruto's dad running
[1:21:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh boy, kitty is nearby
[1:21:08] <%tank7013> The most goofy bodysplash of all time
[1:21:11] <%Savarro> @awanderingkaivo THATS GOOD TOO
[1:21:15] <President_valentine> I fucking love that
[1:21:16] <jetstreamlove_R> The Boruto's Dad's Run
[1:21:22] <jorniev> ARRIVEDERCHI
[1:21:29] <srv4254> he forgot about koko stand ability
[1:21:30] <zazutobi> Use Yokai abilities often. Gauge refills pretty consistently.
[1:21:32] <@GeneralSCPatton> Try the fist high stance backstep into heavy.
[1:21:32] <Hamborgini> try out that monke in combat if you get the chance
[1:21:35] <+RobertWayneLewis98> number go big and fast
[1:21:38] <+Crunchy_the_clown> I feel like replaying this now
[1:21:51] <DXLelouch24> @awanderingkaivo and i bet William will show up somehow
[1:21:56] <%Blank9> basically as soon as you do damage
[1:21:58] <%valriot> Refills on hits and purification
[1:22:03] <jetstreamlove_R> Can't wait for the JoJo reference in this game
[1:22:04] <%RayReborne> Pat dodge attacks are here, and change per stance. somewhat situational tho
[1:22:07] <jorniev> did he just cut his head with a kick?
[1:22:08] <odnucaf3> It is like Cinders Mod
[1:22:11] <+UKOrigin> lol
[1:22:13] <DeathByPoke7> kill those murderers dead
[1:22:13] <amiavamp> It refills from beating up things, blocking, purifying yokai realms, debuffing, using certain spells...a whole lotta ways to refill it
[1:22:14] <+coolthulhuu> now that i beat endwalker msq i should play this again
[1:22:18] <+aWanderingKaivo> @DXLelouch24 cao cao stole his spirit guardian lol
[1:22:24] <cricket42069> why do they always use british for this stuff lol
[1:22:25] <%Blank9> running high stance heavy is good shit
[1:22:26] <%RayReborne> Belly flop yeyeye
[1:22:27] <+pieking83> playing this game coop is insanely fun
[1:22:32] <GhoulishCripple> landing the yokai parry's give like a 1/3rd to half a bar
[1:22:35] <jorniev> UKEMI
[1:22:47] <jetstreamlove_R> British are just fancy whit the accent bruv
[1:22:49] <%JoshManVGH> Yey
[1:22:51] <%volitzern> Use consumable like crazy, you won't regret it lol
[1:22:53] <Xelhesia> ELMO
[1:22:55] <stormhawk9891> ye
[1:22:55] <%Djinnazz> yer
[1:22:56] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> ye
[1:22:57] <tegas_> Kind of.
[1:22:58] <artoflec> @PatStaresAt you can, but it will use a lot of your stamina
[1:22:58] <@GeneralSCPatton> Yeah
[1:23:00] <President_valentine> Kind of
[1:23:00] <+KBGuilty> ye
[1:23:01] <%valriot> Not but point, but sure
[1:23:01] <DragonOfWarZro> Als
[1:23:03] <%RayReborne> it doesnt stun if it aint a big red attack
[1:23:03] <srv4254> u can use it like a monhun gs tackle
[1:23:05] <zazutobi> You can but it does have a cooldown.
[1:23:06] <%Blank9> it only interrupts red attacks
[1:23:07] <amiavamp> Yeah it's a hyperarmor attack too
[1:23:07] <shiny_prinny> yeah, you can string it into combos
[1:23:08] <+Axellogic> kinda it only parries if red
[1:23:09] <cartakus> It is a bitch slap
[1:23:09] <GhoulishCripple> kind of. it's just a big hit
[1:23:11] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah it does a bit of damage and can interrupt the end of your animations
[1:23:12] <%RayReborne> that last guy hit you through it
[1:23:15] <scrumbotime> It just doesn't get the same Big Stun Counter i think
[1:23:17] <+zanz_san> Focus attack combo extender
[1:23:18] <+UKOrigin> @cricket42069 why do they always use american for everything.
[1:23:19] <sussy_baka_999> Keep in mind it uses 1 anima
[1:23:20] <odnucaf3> I don´t Know, I used the Phantom Type.
[1:23:25] <%MooseIsGoose> It mitigates a little dmg on any attack right?
[1:23:30] <%volitzern> Like using fire paper will unlock permanent fire papers kinda thing.
[1:23:33] <tegas_> The blue one is the best dodge, red is easiest to parry with, and purp is for tryhards.
[1:23:35] <anAngryHamster> It's a stone Luigi. You didn't make it
[1:23:40] <GhoulishCripple> it only really counters the red attacks. BUT most weapons have a parry skill for each stance
[1:23:43] <+UKOrigin> xenoblade uk va = great, ffxiv uk va = great
[1:23:44] <%JoshManVGH> You DID it!
[1:23:46] <+JustToWatch> I think you can do Kodama bonus now
[1:23:48] <@GeneralSCPatton> I believe the counter can also cancel you out of the zero ki stun state
[1:23:54] <iamnuff> Ninjutsu gives unlimited consumables. Like how pyromancy gives respawning fireballs.
[1:24:00] <DragonOfWarZro> Using spirit stones also charges your Yokai trigger
[1:24:03] <@GeneralSCPatton> If not the counter, then yokai abilities do it
[1:24:08] <cricket42069> @UKOrigin idk, do they? I just think it's interesting that the default "things that are old" voice is always british english :p
[1:24:09] <+Axellogic> Stamina is a good stat to level early so you can wear more armor
[1:24:12] <DXLelouch24> I used feral most of the time
[1:24:14] <DXLelouch24> Speed
[1:24:19] <%Blank9> offering is just "please take all my trash for exp"
[1:24:24] <%Savarro> @generalscpatton I know the counter definitely can
[1:24:32] <President_valentine> I was also mainly Feral
[1:24:33] <+KBGuilty> Important thing about the Brute counter is that you can do it even when stamina drained, it can save your ass sometimes when you spend too much and get hit.
[1:24:33] <GhoulishCripple> @generalscpatton the feral dodge let's you get out slightly faster than normal
[1:24:37] <iamnuff> Doesn't offering also give you extra healing items?
[1:24:41] <%valriot> Yes
[1:24:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ye
[1:24:44] <shiny_prinny> yeah
[1:24:45] <%volitzern> Yup!
[1:24:47] <%superc37> oh yeah anima is completely separate from stamina, meaning you can use whatever anima moves you want, even parries or dodges, without using stamina
[1:24:49] <iamnuff> Just beat dudes until skill points come out
[1:24:50] <%Blank9> ya
[1:24:50] <+coolthulhuu> yep, all you gotta do is grind
[1:24:50] <%JoshManVGH> If you grind hard enough
[1:24:51] <amiavamp> Flux is important for weapons with crap ki recovery like fists and sword
[1:24:52] <+Axellogic> eventually
[1:24:53] <+Local16> Easily
[1:24:54] <+aWanderingKaivo> tales a while but yeah
[1:24:55] <%volitzern> With enough work lol
[1:24:57] <Hamborgini> I don't know how long that would take, but yeah
[1:24:58] <%Blank9> and you can respec anytime before that too
[1:24:59] <%valriot> You can get everything on every weapon, on 1 character if you want
[1:24:59] <%JoshManVGH> You can do anything
[1:25:06] <JayEarly> can't you respec skills whenever too
[1:25:15] <+aWanderingKaivo> flux is important for everyone tbh once you learn it
[1:25:19] <artoflec> yeah do all the menu stuff when its menu time
[1:25:21] <%Blank9> yeah just take blue numbers
[1:25:27] <illtima> You should at least get a better weapon
[1:25:32] <+aWanderingKaivo> NICE
[1:25:35] <President_valentine> Bye
[1:25:36] <%JoshManVGH> LUL
[1:25:37] <+cheerfulnpc> @JayEarly Pretty much.  I think you need an item, but it's pretty cheap.
[1:25:38] <@Ranryu692> lol nice
[1:25:38] <DXLelouch24> You can get all the skills because you get seperare points per weapon
[1:25:40] <jorniev> NICE
[1:25:41] <%Savarro> Yeah I've never touched gear or skills mid mission
[1:25:41] <+kewlmyc> thank god no one can swim
[1:25:42] <GhoulishCripple> yeah don't worry about equipment mid mission unless you are at a wall
[1:25:47] <iamnuff> This is the first mission, so it was worth it for me to check my weapons, but overall it's not worth worrying about in-mission.
[1:25:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I would just farm revenants at the beginning of each mission to get new, better stuff
[1:25:51] <+Axellogic> it helps a little on the first mission cause you start the game in trash gear
[1:25:51] <+BoboDaHobo> seems like it took about 30 minutes to break this mind goblin. at least for this game
[1:25:55] <%JoshManVGH> "HUH!? *slap*"
[1:25:56] <%RayReborne> I personally sacrifice all white stuff to the kodama for extra elixirs but yeah
[1:26:05] <Hydrapissed> monkaS
[1:26:05] <%JoshManVGH> Spooked friend!
[1:26:06] <jorniev> ARE there grapling moves in this game?
[1:26:11] <Captbutt> the baby D:
[1:26:11] <%Savarro> He HATES it
[1:26:13] <+KBGuilty> stomped
[1:26:13] <President_valentine> Don't Bully the Kodama
[1:26:14] <%MooseIsGoose> How dare you
[1:26:16] <JayEarly> @kewlmyc even if you can swim you're kinda fucked if you're wearing armor
[1:26:16] <Hamborgini> @jorniev Yes!
[1:26:18] <%Blank9> sorta yeah
[1:26:18] <%superc37> @jorniev yup
[1:26:22] <%PatchTheSquid> @jorniev yes
[1:26:28] <+KBGuilty> @jorniev there are izuna drops my dude
[1:26:29] <captainnathaniel> why playing this game again?
[1:26:30] <+aWanderingKaivo> @RayReborne yeah that's a good strat especially early game
[1:26:32] <+kewlmyc> @JayEarly Fair enough
[1:26:40] <jorniev> OH MY GOD THERE ARE GRAPLES
[1:26:41] <CrimsonGargoyle> oooo, what were the goblins for this game?
[1:26:48] <@GeneralSCPatton> The fancy tech is to squeeze 2 fluxes into the same ki pulse by cycling through all 3 stances at once.
[1:26:50] <+JustToWatch> theres' some other stuff behind the houses
[1:26:51] <%RayReborne> @awanderingkaivo yee
[1:26:51] <@Ranryu692> @CrimsonGargoyle skipping the first game
[1:26:53] <President_valentine> Don't skip leg day
[1:26:55] <CrimsonGargoyle> DEKICKPITATED
[1:26:56] <+aWanderingKaivo> he'll kick you apart, he'll kick you apart! ooooh
[1:26:57] <jorniev> I KNEW HE KICKC HIS HEAD OFF BACK THEN
[1:27:00] <DanXaliberc> I never tried the fists in this game but damn they look fun to use
[1:27:01] <DragonOfWarZro> There is a big grab move for the player
[1:27:01] <%superc37> @captainnathaniel read the streams title bruh
[1:27:04] <CrimsonGargoyle> @Ranryu692 ah thank you
[1:27:06] <jorniev> THIS GAME IS CRAZY
[1:27:08] <%superc37> also bc its good
[1:27:12] <%volitzern> If you keep hitting them on the way down more stuff pops off lol
[1:27:14] <@Ranryu692> @CrimsonGargoyle you're welcome
[1:27:16] <zazutobi> Bow for unarmored heads and guns for armored heads.
[1:27:17] <iamnuff> DEEEECAPITATION!
[1:27:21] <amiavamp> Ranged weapons that don't require a degree to use, eat your heart out dark souls
[1:27:23] <+SiegmundCG> is this literally just an excuse not to finish Nioh 1
[1:27:23] <Dopamien> gaur
[1:27:27] <CrimsonGargoyle> nioh 2 is better than 1 in every way
[1:27:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the levels in general are better here
[1:27:31] <+Nomenanza> this game just removes Nioh 1 from my mind and that is a good thing
[1:27:33] <+Exicuren> Waaaay better
[1:27:34] <+RobertWayneLewis98> He didnt like the first game?
[1:27:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> better looking too
[1:27:36] <%PatchTheSquid> I love that you can just RP multiple DMC characters in this game.
[1:27:42] <DXLelouch24> I mean your half yokai
[1:27:45] <DXLelouch24> It makes sense
[1:27:56] <+cheerfulnpc> Nioh 2 definitely corrected a lot of Nioh 1's flaws.
[1:27:57] <JayEarly> I swear to god Team Ninja haven't changed the physics for decapitated heads since fucking Ninja Gaiden on the xbox
[1:27:57] <%RayReborne> @patchthesquid Kappa ye
[1:27:58] <AoiRob> can you do judgment cut end in this game
[1:28:06] <CrimsonGargoyle> @PatchTheSquid DMC, Onimusha, the list is endless
[1:28:06] <amiavamp> Fists and odachi are both great at bullying down turtling human enemies
[1:28:07] <artoflec> @AoiRob yes
[1:28:08] <JayEarly> they still bounce like beach balls
[1:28:09] <+SiegmundCG> ngl fists being OP was the only reason i enjoyed Nioh 2
[1:28:09] <cricket42069> nooo the dinner pot
[1:28:12] <%greasypete00> yo that move is so cool
[1:28:16] <srv4254> judgement cut its dlc
[1:28:17] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt have you played the DLCs?
[1:28:19] <jorniev> HE PUNCHED HIS ARM ADN HIS HEAD OFF
[1:28:19] <President_valentine> You can get a judgment cut
[1:28:22] <+VentWilsn> love tuning into a stream while playing the new mario party
[1:28:25] <%captain_thickthighs> mickey likes it!!
[1:28:29] <%Savarro> I've played 2 so much I don't remember much from Nioh 1 other than Yuki Onna, William, and the last few levels were awful
[1:28:29] <AoiRob> @artoflec fuckin sick
[1:28:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> :)
[1:28:34] <sussy_baka_999> shot his head off with an arrow
[1:28:40] <+pectusumbra> god this game
[1:28:40] <andrei1h1> parry only works on humans tho
[1:28:42] <Xelhesia> BECOME AKIRA PAY
[1:28:44] <+Nomenanza> fists are so good in this game it's insane
[1:28:47] <Mixoops> @captainnathaniel He literally just started
[1:28:48] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh his head is gone
[1:28:50] <BackflipCharm> I think fists might be rad
[1:28:50] <%Blank9> this game fucks
[1:28:53] <iamnuff> parries are great, but I was always shit at them.  The chain-sickle's parry is dope
[1:28:56] <+Exicuren> all of them
[1:28:56] <%JoshManVGH> Why have I not been using fists....
[1:29:00] <%RayReborne> LOOK AT BATTERING RAM
[1:29:03] <jorniev> THIS GAME FUCKS
[1:29:04] <%Visorak6> you slept on this
[1:29:04] <+OperatorPlease> YEAH THEY ARE
[1:29:05] <illtima> Look for a skill in High
[1:29:05] <+critikal_bit> They're the coolest!
[1:29:07] <%PatchTheSquid> you can get trish's scythe throw too.
[1:29:09] <+Nomenanza> stomp is that good shit too
[1:29:09] <DragonOfWarZro> You can do a judgement cut
[1:29:17] <KyberNasse> How is this compared to the first one?
[1:29:18] <%Agami23> you better get a real impact by the end of this
[1:29:18] <+rafaelba93> parries are great here
[1:29:20] <President_valentine> Go fist everything
[1:29:20] <+Tucker0603> all the weapons in this game are fucking hype
[1:29:21] <%MooseIsGoose> that stomp is pretty good
[1:29:24] <+Nomenanza> like 8
[1:29:24] <%Djinnazz> 4
[1:29:24] <%Blank9> everything is fantastic
[1:29:24] <%valriot> 4
[1:29:25] <captainnathaniel> @Mixoops i remember him playing this when it launched. he could have played it off stream
[1:29:25] <KatabolicRage> oh a bunch
[1:29:26] <amiavamp> NG++++
[1:29:27] <%superc37> this makes me want to see a nioh game that JUST character action
[1:29:27] <artoflec> unfortunately you gotta remember a lot of the coolest shit only works on human enemies 😩
[1:29:27] <Hamborgini> 4 or 5?
[1:29:27] <Mixoops> yes
[1:29:27] <illtima> like 5 or 6
[1:29:28] <+Tucker0603> MANY
[1:29:29] <andrei1h1> 4, just like the first
[1:29:29] <President_valentine> A lot
[1:29:29] <+KBGuilty> 4?
[1:29:30] <%superc37> like 5
[1:29:31] <%Savarro> A LOT
[1:29:31] <+McSoliace> ennough
[1:29:31] <Vakojin> All of them
[1:29:31] <BarryMcCockiner___> 4
[1:29:31] <+trackles_64> iNBFINITE
[1:29:31] <@GeneralSCPatton> 4
[1:29:32] <%Visorak6> 4
[1:29:32] <TranquiloArman> more than 2
[1:29:33] <iamnuff> How many can you handle?
[1:29:34] <+OneTrueAsshat> 5 playthroughs
[1:29:36] <+Crunchy_the_clown> I think 7
[1:29:36] <+Exicuren> The fists have a parry AND a just defense
[1:29:39] <+cheerfulnpc> I made it through three before I got burned out
[1:29:42] <$Jaxnos> oh no... now i wanna buy nioh 2 on top of my 500 other games oh no
[1:29:48] <+bravofifeniner> New  Gme plus is  different gamr yoo
[1:29:50] <+AngryHomunculus> So does this game completely replace the need to play Nioh 1?
[1:29:50] <%codedoomboy> Too many
[1:29:51] <Arina_Beam> look on the left of the fist skills
[1:29:55] <+Inferno_Icon> that parry only works on humans
[1:29:56] <odnucaf3> Odachi can parry Youkais
[1:29:58] <+aWanderingKaivo> bolting boar works on yokai too even
[1:30:00] <+Nomenanza> you also are not seeing some hidden skills
[1:30:01] <@PeachSaliva> Show us your balls
[1:30:02] <DXLelouch24> Tonfas with elemental skills attached then apply chaos debuff with two elements.Go ham with fists,profit?
[1:30:03] <stormhawk9891> Then start using Odachi to learn skills for it
[1:30:04] <%RayReborne> i think its mostly the same with some new stuff
[1:30:05] <mf_doomfist98> Man as good as Nioh 2 is they really could make a good Ninja Gaiden now
[1:30:07] <+cheerfulnpc> @AngryHomunculus Unless you care about plot, yes.
[1:30:08] <iamnuff> "How bout I just parry your ass into the fucking floor, huh."
[1:30:09] <+Axellogic> gotta use odachi first for points :V
[1:30:13] <BackflipCharm> Yeah show balls
[1:30:15] <%valriot> THATS THE GOOD ONE
[1:30:15] <marvel877> How goes the Patgoblins?
[1:30:16] <%PatchTheSquid> you don't have any yet
[1:30:18] <amiavamp> Bolting Boar can parry Yoki (the oni looking yokai) and throw them to the floor
[1:30:24] <%valriot> Moonlught Redux is all you need
[1:30:26] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt You also have hidden skills that drop from bosses that do even sicker shit
[1:30:27] <fairore> @mf_doomfist98 wow

[1:30:34] <%DianaTheAscian> So how's Pat been doing?
[1:30:41] <+Axellogic> My favorite odachi skill is Thunderbolt
[1:30:41] <knight_verse> Press square to see the full skills list
[1:30:42] <%PatchTheSquid> There are hidden boss skills too.
[1:30:43] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Yellow icons are moves while blue is passives
[1:30:44] <+Exicuren> The Odachi has a lot of stance switching back and forth
[1:30:47] <+KBGuilty> @DianaTheAscian Happy so far
[1:30:47] <@PeachSaliva> pat show balls
[1:30:59] <CuttleCrow> yea

[1:31:41] <Hydrapissed> galatica phantom
[1:31:45] <%Blank9> beyond infinity is SO COOL
[1:31:45] <%superc37> ORAORAORAORA
[1:31:46] <KaironFortressKnight> Hi Paige
[1:31:48] <iamnuff> Woolie doesn't know. We hid it from him.
[1:31:48] <silentshrug> his honor is his life
[1:31:50] <+kevlarkoala> that glass house????
[1:31:50] <%Djinnazz> lol
[1:31:52] <+Nomenanza> beyond infinity is rough to time but is insanely powerful
[1:31:52] <%justcallmebobplease> Because THE WOOLIE WAY
[1:31:52] <AngryAsian5> BEYOND Infinity
[1:31:52] <rReizs> you know why pat
[1:31:53] <+pectusumbra> M i n d G o b l i n s is why
[1:31:54] <%Savarro> Beyond Infinity FUCKS HARD
[1:31:54] <%MidnightBurst12> feet?
[1:31:56] <+bugz_munny> same reason he hasnt played 14
[1:31:57] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt just a warning, the DLCs have some of the most balls to the wall unfair and cool bosses ever
[1:31:58] <%MelfinaStarwind> balls, feet, or orb? lgwTilt
[1:32:01] <DXLelouch24> Tell him fuck it
[1:32:01] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:32:01] <silentshrug> did you not see his disco elysium playthrough
[1:32:04] <%MooseIsGoose> Hi paige
[1:32:05] <President_valentine> Fist also have a Royal Guard
[1:32:06] <Hamborgini> looking forward to the next podcast
[1:32:07] <zazutobi> All weapons have great abilities and combo potential.
[1:32:08] <DXLelouch24> Tell him next podcast
[1:32:08] <@PeachSaliva> Show feet and balls plz
[1:32:09] <+kevlarkoala> "how has woolie not skipped to this" says the man in the mind goblin stream lol
[1:32:14] <+Tucker0603> I always fuck up beyond infinity though
[1:32:18] <+KBGuilty> Theres even an Izuna Drop
[1:32:19] <silentshrug> he ate honor
[1:32:20] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This game is basically godhand
[1:32:22] <%Blank9> now imagine every other weapon being as cool an indepth
[1:32:23] <+VentWilsn> i feel like you already talked about how woolie will play through a series by release order every time
[1:32:24] <President_valentine> The fist were made for Woolie
[1:32:25] <thefrogman951> There's also secret skills from certain bosses
[1:32:30] <%PatchTheSquid> Mind goblins? Obliterated.
[1:32:37] <DragonOfWarZro> Because nioh 1 is still really good
[1:32:41] <%Blank9> parrying a dualwield weapon is tough
[1:32:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> the training room in the dojo outside of missions is a good place to practice it
[1:32:43] <%MooseIsGoose> is it equiped
[1:32:46] <%superc37> dun dun dun dun
[1:32:50] <%SovPho> It's a hard parry
[1:32:50] <stoatacious> has pat done the ff14 raids yet?
[1:32:52] <%Broand> Twin hatchets seem like a weapon type
[1:32:52] <JayEarly> The Nioh 2 director talked about being interested in Celtic mythology and that would be so sick
[1:32:53] <@GeneralSCPatton> Nice
[1:32:56] <sussy_baka_999> He keeps depleting his Ki on your guard and you just wait
[1:32:57] <cricket42069> the music that keeps starting lol
[1:33:02] <%Savarro> @tucker0603 I did too but when you nail it and start Ora Ora at x1000000 speed it's worth it LUL
[1:33:02] <$Order_of_Mystery> you did once say that Woolie is just as crazy as you, but better at hiding it @patstaresat
[1:33:04] <%RealThiele> @stoatacious no
[1:33:06] <%PatchTheSquid> IDK if he has even seen the move equip menu yet. LUL
[1:33:08] <+Exicuren> Don't worry, you can also learn an Alpha Counter
[1:33:19] <stoatacious> @stoatacious ty
[1:33:20] <+Nomenanza> @cricket42069 it's a good indicator of low hp honestly
[1:33:29] <StormSamurai8> Ohhhh that's where you get cups!
[1:33:32] <DXLelouch24> Beyond infinity has some timing you have to land but once you get the hang of it you can delete bosses
[1:33:39] <cricket42069> yeah it's great, just funny from an outside perspective
[1:33:40] <wqorst> oh my god
[1:33:42] <%PatchTheSquid> Basically Beowulfs move set.
[1:33:44] <+aWanderingKaivo> @JayEarly makes sense, William in Nioh 1's guardian spirit was from celtic myth iirc
[1:33:45] <StormSamurai8> GOOD GOD
[1:33:49] <amiavamp> Beyond infinity is absolutely insane
[1:33:49] <%Blank9> fists annihilate enemy ki so hard
[1:33:50] <Sp3ctre48> That poor man
[1:33:51] <%RealThiele> corner fucked
[1:33:52] <shiny_prinny> and this is just one weapon too
[1:33:52] <+Nomenanza> man I wanna launch Nioh 2 now too
[1:33:52] <+RobertWayneLewis98> day 1,163 of waiting for woolie to play Arkham City :)
[1:33:56] <%superc37> AND THATS JUST ONE WEAPONS OUT OF LIKE 14
[1:33:58] <silentshrug> golly gee you punched
[1:34:01] <+pectusumbra> it's like mortal combat blood. I fully expect people to explode into ribcages at this point
[1:34:01] <Dopamien> turns out, we're all kinda average and similar lobosShrug
[1:34:02] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat Beyond infinity has some timing you have to land but once you get the hang of it you can delete bosses
[1:34:09] <%Vextalyst> The sneak attack with fists is also amazing Pat
[1:34:10] <+Orcapugs> Tell him Nioh 2 has Roll back
[1:34:13] <GemeSvev> Man, sometimes I forget how much I loved this game.
[1:34:14] <$Order_of_Mystery> yo these fist weapons look dope as fuck Kreygasm
[1:34:19] <Ashenik1> was there a historical fighting fist weapon?
[1:34:23] <%volitzern> XD
[1:34:26] <President_valentine> All the weapons are fun but fist are on another level
[1:34:28] <JayEarly> @Orcapugs what do you mean
[1:34:29] <+JustToWatch> there was a path behind the first houses that you missed
[1:34:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> man I'm so used to the twilight version of this level
[1:34:31] <amiavamp> the Cestus?
[1:34:43] <Hamborgini> @Ashenik1 do brass knuckles count?
[1:34:45] <GhoulishCripple> @patstaresat the Switchglaive has a near infinite stamina stance switch combo. it's straight nuts
[1:34:48] <+aWanderingKaivo> those punch dagger things
[1:34:49] <%superc37> i mean brass knucks aint exactly a difficult thing to make
[1:34:54] <cricket42069> so.... no head?
[1:35:02] <+VentWilsn> tell him you can make a punchgirl in Nioh 2
[1:35:04] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt find out how to do judgment cuts then show woolie
[1:35:07] <CappuccinoGuil> wait, hold up, isn't this area from Nioh 1?
[1:35:10] <%Savarro> I was sad this game got kinda buried because it came out a few weeks before FF7R and a few other games
[1:35:10] <%superc37> also this game has a bloodborne weapon, so fuck realism
[1:35:15] <anAngryHamster> @ashenik1 None that weren't for show or ceremony.
[1:35:23] <+Nomenanza> so I guess everyone is british in eng dub?
[1:35:24] <%superc37> @cappuccinoguil no
[1:35:24] <%JoshManVGH> Short Kicks, one might say
[1:35:27] <+HefestoForges> face off
[1:35:29] <DracaenaLeaf> good shot
[1:35:31] <Ashenik1> @Hamborgini  I mean something useful in warfare.
[1:35:34] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt trust me, you really need to play the DLCs just for the bosses
[1:35:38] <%Blank9> oh yeah this does just straight up have bloodborne weapons
[1:35:59] <captainnathaniel> ALL OF THEM
[1:36:00] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> All DLCs

[1:36:22] <%Broand> From every game ever
[1:36:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> EVERY game
[1:36:24] <+Nomenanza> if Pat has fists it means he ALREADY has DLC
[1:36:25] <KaironFortressKnight> YELL LOUDER
[1:36:25] <%TheAntiNihilist> I wonder if Pat used the bow a lot in Nioh 1. I kind of doubt it based on his last play session
[1:36:25] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[1:36:26] <+JustToWatch> Every game ever made
[1:36:27] <@ssjklyco> From listening to old podcast, you have someone else he knows off handedly recommend him something despite you being the one who recommended him a thing for years.
[1:36:28] <@QueequegTheater> EVERYONE
[1:36:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> no pat, EVERY game
[1:36:33] <%Agami23> no pat, do the dlc now before you can access it
[1:36:35] <JayEarly> probably no fist weapons were used in warfare because range has always been the meta
[1:36:36] <+JustToWatch> shiny in house
[1:36:36] <artoflec> 3 dlcs for this game and the first game @VentWilsn
[1:36:38] <+pectusumbra> Chat stop

[1:36:44] <+AntithesisEK> there were three dlc additions @VentWilsn
[1:36:46] <@PrefectusCorgi> Do Better
[1:36:46] <%Savarro> The dlc added weapon types alongside story content, but the story is post base game
[1:36:47] <%maskofmichael> LOUD NOISES

[1:36:48] <amiavamp> calm down guys he's doing the thing lol

[1:37:00] <%AncelDeLambert> "Why is everyone mean me?"
[1:37:00] <fairore> oh really
[1:37:01] <%MooseIsGoose> Loud NOiSES
[1:37:02] <Ashenik1> Is Nioh 2 harder than Nioh 1?
[1:37:04] <GunneryGoblin> my biggest issue with Nioh 2 so far is so many of the weapons are dope as hell and i want to use them all
[1:37:04] <silentshrug> do what we think we want not what we say we want
[1:37:05] <+JustToWatch> lol
[1:37:05] <%RealThiele> SHOW FEET
[1:37:05] <SharKinStereo> The truth is WE were the goblins all along.
[1:37:06] <+zenraider> we are the goblins pat
[1:37:06] <+pectusumbra> hahahahaha
[1:37:07] <+KBGuilty> lmao
[1:37:07] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> the dlcs are like post game content
[1:37:10] <Hamborgini> big flop
[1:37:10] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Is chat being butt faces again?
[1:37:11] <%croxeye> LUL
[1:37:11] <akitanito> how did he not hear that
[1:37:13] <anAngryHamster> Did you remember to press enter this time?
[1:37:13] <DarkestDom> LUL
[1:37:15] <@QueequegTheater> Chat is confused! It hurt itself in its confusion!
[1:37:17] <DXLelouch24> Thats why i beat 1 and the dlc first before i played and beat this plus dlc cause i knew i couldnt go back after.
[1:37:18] <%RayReborne> Show Orb Kappa
[1:37:21] <%Bt_Robot> Pat, don't you know? Chat is never happy.
[1:37:22] <cricket42069> blueberry or riot!!
[1:37:24] <DragonOfWarZro> Nioh 2 way harder
[1:37:24] <CuttleCrow> no tip for the grocery guy
[1:37:26] <%Blank9> 12ft belly flop
[1:37:27] <+aWanderingKaivo> @GunneryGoblin for real its hard to pick
[1:37:28] <%SaiyanShoto> Groshery
[1:37:29] <KaironFortressKnight> My favorite Siegfried move
[1:37:33] <@QueequegTheater> High stance chads only in this chat
[1:37:34] <amiavamp> @Ashenik1 yes and no. Enemies have new abilities that are tough, but you get WAY more abilities, and you can play way more aggressive.
[1:37:36] <+Nomenanza> it is so much better ye
[1:37:36] <iamnuff> So is the whole game.
[1:37:37] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> @patstaresat You have a level unspent.
[1:37:41] <+zanz_san> How's the Covid booster shot situation in Canada?
[1:37:42] <akitanito> tip him with a coupon
[1:37:43] <+Axellogic> I know right?
[1:37:43] <artoflec> yeah the first game's skill tree is bad
[1:37:44] <%superc37> yeah the dlc's assume that youve beaten the game at least once on ng+
[1:37:48] <JayEarly> that grapple is so brutal
[1:37:49] <captainnathaniel> nioh 2 a improvement in every way. even the OST is better
[1:37:52] <+Nomenanza> Touching Nioh 1 after Nioh 2 feels gross
[1:37:52] <Hamborgini> it's a just-block
[1:37:55] <+superchronicc> is this monster hunter?
[1:37:58] <cricket42069> @QueequegTheater crawls away in low stance
[1:37:59] <artoflec> i love nioh 1 but i really dislike that skill tree
[1:38:01] <+AntithesisEK> Skill List button also helps you find things in a clear row
[1:38:05] <+aWanderingKaivo> that one only works if you use it in actual combat against an attacker
[1:38:05] <DragonOfWarZro> No discord cheese in 2
[1:38:09] <+Axellogic> I hate that you cant learn thunderbolt til rather late cause its such a cool odachi skill
[1:38:10] <@ssjklyco> I have a mind goblin steam: Ignore chat on a game that chat will backseat the hardest on
[1:38:11] <CrimsonGargoyle> @PatStaresAt man i hope you enjoy this crazyass game, i hated the first and completely skipped it and LOVE this one!
[1:38:13] <DeathByPoke7> just defend
[1:38:13] <+cheerfulnpc> Honestly the only reason I go back to 1 is because I love the series and it's more Nioh, even if a bit less good.
[1:38:15] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> its a parry
[1:38:16] <%Blank9> just guard
[1:38:18] <DXLelouch24> Pat you can totally beat that big guy in the beginning.I know because i did
[1:38:20] <@QueequegTheater> justguard
[1:38:27] <%dalmek> You can do a normal block and if the timing is wrong you'll still guard
[1:38:36] <Saltmeisterr> hullo chat
[1:38:38] <%Blank9> they're AI
[1:38:38] <%superc37> dont summon the npcs, theyre all idiots
[1:38:39] <KaironFortressKnight> Yeah, if you're a coward
[1:38:42] <Saltmeisterr> how goes nioh?
[1:38:44] <cricket42069> here goes..

[1:39:11] <KatabolicRage> go... go back inside pat
[1:39:11] <amiavamp> It was on the floor in the corner, you scared it
[1:39:11] <+Crunchy_the_clown> it was in the corner

[1:39:13] <iamnuff> It was inside, you swung directly at it
[1:39:13] <DXLelouch24> Not a human
[1:39:14] <%borkmire> blind
[1:39:14] <%superc37> @robertwaynelewis98 no, you summon real people at bonfires
[1:39:16] <+AngryHomunculus> @PatStaresAt I'm assuming because you said you're playing the PC version that they fixed some of the GPU issues you mentioned on the podcast
[1:39:21] <Dopamien> MrDestructoid merely pretending
[1:39:21] <%Samuy_JP> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[1:39:23] <+aWanderingKaivo> he was in that container but you scared him

[1:39:27] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> he knows it's AI, dummies
[1:39:28] <%JoshManVGH> Rip and Tear, friendo!
[1:39:28] <JayEarly> I think they made the Kodama sounds way louder in this one
[1:39:33] <cricket42069> oh here we go....
[1:39:35] <%PatchTheSquid> you scared him
[1:39:36] <Ashenik1> @amiavamp I have got PTSD after Maria, will there be something on similar level of frustration and roughness?
[1:39:37] <%PMAvers> Nah, it was in that corner, hiding behind a pot. I think you scared it and it hid when you swung.
[1:39:39] <+superchronicc> you should hunt that horse monster
[1:39:41] <JayEarly> I actually managed to find most of them
[1:39:43] <+RobertWayneLewis98> no, that's me :)
[1:39:52] <DXLelouch24> @ashenik1 yes
[1:39:55] <cricket42069> oh huh that chest had a raccoon bastard in it when i opened it lol
[1:39:56] <%volitzern> You can always summon one to farm cups too lol
[1:39:57] <DXLelouch24> Multiple times
[1:40:00] <DXLelouch24> Fuck you
[1:40:01] <amiavamp> @Ashenik1 yes
[1:40:03] <captainnathaniel> @Ashenik1 the first boss in DLC 2.
[1:40:06] <+KBGuilty> THE BOOOT
[1:40:15] <+Nomenanza> oh nice destroyed its horn in like first 2 hits
[1:40:18] <%superc37> HEAL

[1:40:18] <Ashenik1> wonderfull woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:40:18] <akitanito> oof
[1:40:22] <+HefestoForges> @PatStaresAt you can combo soul abilities

[1:40:28] <StormSamurai8> The music...get used to ti
[1:40:33] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Block, don't dodge
[1:40:35] <%FunkyStreams> whats the japanese word for wasted?
[1:40:39] <+HefestoForges> their startup is fast enough to mix them in
[1:40:39] <%RayReborne> he only has One equipped chat lmao
[1:40:40] <Dopamien> 🤷
[1:40:40] <@QueequegTheater> Trust me, it's not Bloodborne
[1:40:46] <%Djinnazz> no
[1:40:46] <+pectusumbra> I guess you can use the monkey spear in your combo? Just weave it in
[1:40:46] <stormhawk9891> no
[1:40:46] <+RobertWayneLewis98> wastedu
[1:40:47] <+KBGuilty> you can cancel normals into soul abilities
[1:40:49] <@GeneralSCPatton> No
[1:40:51] <+Tucker0603> no
[1:40:51] <+Exicuren> nop
[1:40:51] <$Jaxnos> Gosaku: "i'm outta here, chump"
[1:40:51] <GhoulishCripple> monkey spear into a different yokai ability
[1:40:51] <shiny_prinny> no, gotta hoof it
[1:40:53] <+Nomenanza> Ok you know what is annoying in Nioh 1-2 though? Requiring to press a button to respawn
[1:40:55] <+aWanderingKaivo> I think they mean you can use your monkey throw after your normal attack moves
[1:40:55] <%JoshManVGH> No port only shortcuts
[1:40:55] <%superc37> if you have more than one soul core, you can do combo
[1:40:57] <%FunkyStreams> lol
[1:40:57] <%volitzern> I wish lol
[1:40:59] <iamnuff> I found a red grave that I could farm by kicking the dude into a pit and got enough ochako to summon a buddy for the boss fight in 10+ attempts.
[1:41:11] <%PatchTheSquid> nope
[1:41:17] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> you have to level up ninja
[1:41:18] <amiavamp> Backstab is in the ninja skill tree
[1:41:20] <+darethsbane> backstab is part of ninjutsu
[1:41:21] <+Nomenanza> backstab is iirc one of you samurai skills
[1:41:21] <shiny_prinny> ninja skill tree, just like first game
[1:41:22] <stormhawk9891> Backstab is in ninja skill tree
[1:41:23] <President_valentine> Its a ninja skill
[1:41:24] <%JoshManVGH> gotta use consumables to get backstab
[1:41:26] <artoflec> Backstab is in the ninja skill tree, equip some shurikens when you get em and you'll get a point
[1:41:26] <+Nomenanza> oh right ninja
[1:41:26] <+HefestoForges> @aWanderingKaivo yeah that's what I meant
[1:41:26] <amiavamp> But you need to find an item to unlock the ninja skill tree
[1:41:28] <%MooseIsGoose> I think you get it from training mission
[1:41:28] <%superc37> @patstaresat ninjutsu skill tree
[1:41:29] <+critikal_bit> Its in the Ninjitsu tree
[1:41:32] <+Axellogic> Backstab is ninjutsu like in 1
[1:41:33] <+Thunderhawk47> Oh shit Pats a punchman thunde161Mogchamp
[1:41:35] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt Backstab is in the ninja tree. Just use some bombs once you find them.
[1:41:42] <GhoulishCripple> use firebombs and other ninja consumables par
[1:41:44] <%IamGrapes> the demshi roll?
[1:41:47] <DXLelouch24> Wait till you unlock move cancelling with fists, you have only scratched the surface Pat.
[1:41:49] <GhoulishCripple> get free ninja points
[1:41:49] <Saltmeisterr> SICK
[1:41:50] <@GeneralSCPatton> R3 to zoom
[1:41:58] <Dopamien> lmao
[1:42:01] <%superc37> @patstaresat you get ninja points by using consumables like firebombs or the green water thing
[1:42:02] <%Deft_Thought> DEMPSEY ROOOOLL
[1:42:03] <%Visorak6> get BODIED
[1:42:03] <DXLelouch24> Shit gets rediculous
[1:42:09] <+zenraider> is this game on sale on steam?
[1:42:09] <iamnuff> He's tough
[1:42:11] <President_valentine> he's a big boy
[1:42:15] <%JoshManVGH> You can get ninjutsu points by using consumable attack items too
[1:42:16] <%Savarro> Or you can get ninja locks, backstab is one of the first things I think
[1:42:16] <+aWanderingKaivo> nice
[1:42:19] <%volitzern> Make sure to spam consumables to unlock free ones on spawn lol
[1:42:19] <DanXaliberc> yeah I am gonna start rocking the fists once this download is done holy shit
[1:42:23] <%RayReborne> yup
[1:42:28] <JayEarly> my man bringing 20th century boxing techniques to warring states Japan
[1:42:29] <MisoScoots> is this game actually good or no?
[1:42:30] <Ashenik1> so basically Nioh 2 is as rough and frustrating as Nioh 1 but you have got more abilities and skills to counter it? PepoG
[1:42:30] <%Bluwizard21> you were told
[1:42:32] <%toolofparanoia> toolofparanoia subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 24 month streak! Two years woo! Defeat those goblins and pet babies and kiss paige or vice versa
[1:42:35] <Vakojin> Tonfa's are my favourite.
[1:42:35] <artoflec> Odachi in Nioh 1 had that move too but not right away i guess
[1:42:38] <%superc37> free points
[1:42:39] <+Crunchy_the_clown> This game rocks
[1:42:43] <roobanguy> you will always have at least 3 elixers if you die
[1:42:46] <+Crunchy_the_clown> WAAAAAY better than the first one
[1:42:47] <%volitzern> You get points for ninjutsu to unlock ones you spawn with
[1:42:47] <GhoulishCripple> free ninja points from using firebombs
[1:42:47] <amiavamp> The consumable, normal versions of ninja items give you ninja points
[1:42:52] <+Axellogic> consumables like bombs give you ninja skill points
[1:42:52] <+superchronicc> you showed showed that wall
[1:42:55] <%Blank9> everything was BIG upgraded
[1:42:55] <@QueequegTheater> If you spam consumables, you will unlock free ones on spawn
[1:42:55] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Did you see Zullie the Witch's video from today? Apparently there's a model of a Lancer from Gears of War in the game's files for some reason
[1:42:56] <%JoshManVGH> Ninja points can be allocated for replenishing consumables
[1:42:56] <+bugz_munny> fuuuuuuuuuck
[1:42:57] <+pandapeeps> Hey pat! Cool, Nioh today huh?
[1:42:59] <%Agami23> use firebombs to get skill points in ninja, use talasmins to get spell points in magic. stuff like that
[1:42:59] <+bugz_munny> thats so sick
[1:43:00] <+aWanderingKaivo> @PatStaresAt using for example talismans will give you omnyo (magic) skill points you can use to unlock spells
[1:43:02] <GemeSvev> @MisoScoots It's honestly one of my favorite Souls like games, if not #1.
[1:43:02] <TigerCrownPorter> Chat always gotta explain stuff in the worst way
[1:43:05] <GilliamYaeger> YEAH FISTS
[1:43:05] <%AgniBrandt> Man the fist grapple is so great
[1:43:06] <rReizs> if you use consumable ninja and onmyo items you get exp for those skill trees
[1:43:06] <GunneryGoblin> watching Nioh 2 makes me wanna go play more Nioh 2, thanks pat
[1:43:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @MisoScoots in case it isn't overwhelmingly obvious, it's very good
[1:43:10] <iamnuff> Wait, eating consumablies gives you ninjutsu points?
[1:43:11] <%Agami23> you can make firebombs and stuff into estus
[1:43:11] <GilliamYaeger> BEST WEAPON THEY HAVE *EVER* MADE
[1:43:16] <%Djinnazz> helmet
[1:43:16] <%MooseIsGoose> helmet
[1:43:17] <%Visorak6> You shot his helmet off
[1:43:18] <Hamborgini> you knocked his helmet off
[1:43:19] <%skeletonmilk> helmet i think
[1:43:22] <%RayReborne> using consumables gives you either Ninja or Magic skill points
[1:43:22] <%Savarro> Was Odachi in base Nioh or was it a dlc weapon I can't remember
[1:43:22] <%PMAvers> I think it hit his helmet.
[1:43:22] <soflicar> hit his helm
[1:43:24] <President_valentine> he had helmet
[1:43:25] <JayEarly> it means using items now helps you later
[1:43:25] <@GeneralSCPatton> You can grind ninja and magic skill points even by using the normal consumables
[1:43:26] <@QueequegTheater> helmet
[1:43:29] <%RayReborne> attack Consumables

[1:45:41] <%abrupt_abe> Once Nioh breaks, it breaks big
[1:45:42] <+superchronicc> is nioh the dark souls of souls games?
[1:45:45] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Is this harder than Nioh 1?
[1:45:46] <cartakus> Nioh 2 and ffxiv the only things I can do before ER
[1:45:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> just win more
[1:45:59] <%JoshManVGH> Backstab is also in Ninja points.
[1:46:01] <TurtlesAndTentacles> you think? pol8
[1:46:01] <+cheerfulnpc> @superchronicc Nioh is the Dark Souls of video games.
[1:46:04] <TurtlesAndTentacles> lol
[1:46:08] <DXLelouch24> @nigelschnauzerpug yes and no
[1:46:12] <Dopamien> just 4Head
[1:46:12] <%holydeviant1> sometimes a good game beats your ass like a pair of bongos
[1:46:15] <DragonOfWarZro> Nioh 2 the best dark souls
[1:46:17] <%toolofparanoia> BE MORE EPIC
[1:46:22] <DXLelouch24> It gets easier as you gitgud
[1:46:27] <GunneryGoblin> you have to unlock ninja before you can get points in it, which he cant do for another couple levels
[1:46:35] <+superchronicc> @superchronicc debatable
[1:46:35] <GhoulishCripple> Just get good 5head
[1:46:41] <iamnuff> Imagine getting suplexed by impalement.
[1:46:42] <DXLelouch24> You can break the game but you have to gitgud to break the game
[1:46:43] <defaultname3887> so did pat already learn the ki bar is actually just a limiter rather than a stamina bar?
[1:46:54] <cartakus> THERE HE IS
[1:47:03] <%toolofparanoia> OH NO
[1:47:10] <cartakus> Classic yokai time
[1:47:24] <Ashenik1> which type of weapon is the most OP in Nioh 2?
[1:47:25] <rReizs> just get the door probably
[1:47:32] <IntrepidEye> Never block in this game
[1:47:34] <%vivaldiva> psa1guy
[1:47:36] <%Blank9> these guys hate being monkeyed
[1:47:36] <%Djinnazz> yeah, kicks destroy ki

[1:47:38] <KeiPrime> switchglaive
[1:47:39] <%SharkMissile> @Ashenik1 Claws, but they're DLC
[1:47:42] <+superchronicc> dont be afraid of being a coward
[1:47:42] <+Nomenanza> unlucky with a timing since he did his guard break
[1:47:43] <cricket42069> this yoki needs a spa day and a blunt
[1:47:43] <amiavamp> @Ashenik1 fists for sure
[1:47:45] <%Dakuu75> blocking is the poor-man's dodge
[1:47:45] <+pectusumbra> you can use that odachi move on this guy right?
[1:47:47] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You will have to learn to block
[1:47:51] <DragonOfWarZro> Ninjutsu
[1:47:51] <%patriotrenegade> why would you listen to chat?
[1:47:53] <cartakus> The ninja version of that thing is just the biggest nightmare ever created
[1:47:56] <%captain_thickthighs> get in its ass!!
[1:47:56] <%Agami23> fuck thats so cool
[1:47:57] <%toolofparanoia> yeyeyeyeye
[1:47:57] <@GeneralSCPatton> Nice dempsey
[1:47:57] <+cheerfulnpc> @IntrepidEye Block is god-like in this game against lesser enemies.
[1:48:00] <%Deft_Thought> Body, body, body, body
[1:48:01] <iamnuff> Block the sword, the kick is a guardbreak.
[1:48:02] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt It varies from enemy to enemy and move to move, but it's pretty important to remember blocking is an option
[1:48:03] <+Cykaima> wassup gamerz her pat
[1:48:04] <DXLelouch24> No with fists you either dodge or parry
[1:48:05] <Ashenik1> thx guys
[1:48:06] <srv4254> MONKE YEA
[1:48:07] <GilliamYaeger> DEMPSEY ROLL MOTHER FUCKER
[1:48:11] <%TheAntiNihilist> can't wait for the boss fight
[1:48:13] <%Blank9> I think heavy high stance fist has multiple hits in the combo
[1:48:21] <+Nomenanza> vertical attacks are great vs these guys since you have higher chances of destroying the horn which instantly destroys most of their Ki
[1:48:23] <%Agami23> monkey spear is good for certain things.
[1:48:24] <GhoulishCripple> use monkey shoot more often @patstaresat
[1:48:25] <cricket42069> ape harder?  idk
[1:48:26] <%superc37> @patstaresat you can only use the yokai parry on attacks that come after the enemies eyes flash red, like in revengance
[1:48:28] <+RobertWayneLewis98> gj
[1:48:28] <+KBGuilty> YOU
[1:48:28] <fairore> nice
[1:48:30] <+KBGuilty> DID IT
[1:48:30] <+Crunchy_the_clown> When their Ki is red GO IN!!!
[1:48:31] <%toolofparanoia> ass eaten
[1:48:32] <%JoshManVGH> Solid!
[1:48:32] <artoflec> man they're not using the red attacks for you for some reason lol
[1:48:33] <@GeneralSCPatton> Purple gear!
[1:48:34] <cricket42069> naisu
[1:48:39] <+Jakeofalco> Better sword ?
[1:48:41] <President_valentine> You can stun lock them when their stamina is broken
[1:48:41] <defaultname3887> yokai skills are mostly for ki
[1:48:47] <%JoshManVGH> LUL
[1:48:47] <+Cykaima> PAUNCH
[1:48:48] <%valriot> Different weapons and Toughness make blocking better
[1:48:48] <+Axellogic> Blocking is better with heavier armor
[1:48:50] <GhoulishCripple> yes it was
[1:48:50] <+HefestoForges> magic sword
[1:48:55] <+RobertWayneLewis98> wow what a loser crybaby
[1:48:56] <+Nomenanza> monke used G U N
[1:48:59] <%Deft_Thought> Man, shit is dire around here
[1:49:03] <+greeam> the yokai moves lower their maximum ki
[1:49:03] <cricket42069> not the baby BibleThump
[1:49:03] <Saltmeisterr> da baby
[1:49:04] <Essixian> Haha lol your wife and child are dead get shit on nerd
[1:49:04] <$SGrim> Not the baby!
[1:49:07] <%valriot> Odachi is BIG block energy
[1:49:07] <%PMAvers> Monkey Shoot sounds like it's the name of a minigame in Super Monkey ball
[1:49:07] <cartakus> Not good idea
[1:49:12] <%abrupt_abe> I always loved fighting the red phantoms for loot
[1:49:12] <amiavamp> Odachi also gets a super block like the lance in MH
[1:49:16] <andrei1h1> kodama sensor went brrrr
[1:49:18] <%Djinnazz> Blocking depends on stance
[1:49:19] <StormSamurai8> Chat you wanna keep armor under 70% in the green right?
[1:49:29] <%AgniBrandt> You also generally want to block instead of dodge in mid stance because the mid stance dodge has shit for i-frames
[1:49:31] <%Blank9> If you block in midstance after a ki pulse, it'll take way less stamina
[1:49:36] <%PMAvers> Gaki do not respect the 1v1
[1:49:44] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Good.
[1:49:44] <%Dakuu75> good
[1:49:44] <iamnuff> GG
[1:49:44] <%Visorak6> good
[1:49:45] <cartakus> Gud
[1:49:45] <+pectusumbra> looks good
[1:49:47] <BepBepAmShep> It's fine
[1:49:47] <+Nomenanza> it looks fine
[1:49:47] <%toolofparanoia> perfect
[1:49:48] <Hamborgini> stream has been fine
[1:49:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> seems fine
[1:49:49] <GemeSvev> Looks great
[1:49:49] <%dalmek> Seems fine
[1:49:49] <%Savarro> Solid
[1:49:50] <%Broand> looks good on my end
[1:49:50] <%ClericOfSparda> Looks good
[1:49:51] <JayEarly> I dunno why I find those little ugly dudes hilarious
[1:49:52] <%JoshManVGH> @stormsamurai8 If you want speedy roll
[1:49:52] <Xelhesia> hood
[1:49:53] <%volitzern> All good
[1:49:56] <GhoulishCripple> @stormsamurai8 no you want it below 25% and blue. fast rolls or nothing
[1:50:00] <IntrepidEye> This is probably the only game I don't go full Havel the rock. I love the mobility here
[1:50:02] <DanXaliberc> good for me
[1:50:02] <%patriotrenegade> perfectly calibrated
[1:50:02] <DragonOfWarZro> Yokai abilites are free damage if you aren't completely garbage
[1:50:04] <Jontman42> dead
[1:50:04] <+HefestoForges> MOOKED
[1:50:05] <Dopamien> everything is bad :)
[1:50:07] <%Agami23> frames seem good, no harsh pixelization on effects or anything. seems fine
[1:50:11] <DXLelouch24> Once you can apply different elements to the enemy with different skills and proc confuse then it gets nuts
[1:50:13] <President_valentine> Gaki will also eat their own if you knock em down next to each other
[1:50:13] <%MooseIsGoose> at least you got the demon
[1:50:19] <srv4254> yea
[1:50:21] <cricket42069> hmm try eating more blueberry
[1:50:22] <President_valentine> Yup
[1:50:25] <+cheerfulnpc> Whenever you hear the enemy spotted you noise it's best to see where they are before moving on, I find
[1:50:28] <ammobasket> seems good
[1:50:35] <GunneryGoblin> that yokai is permagone yeah
[1:50:35] <cartakus> After a while things start to hit way harder than you can handle
[1:50:36] <@GeneralSCPatton> If yokai come out of a grey cloud, they don't respawn
[1:50:37] <%chance_h> Lol why watch streams when Vtubers exist
[1:50:38] <JayEarly> holy shit
[1:50:41] <iamnuff> It's hard to 2v1 with fists, but the odachi has some nice sweeps.
[1:50:43] <%toolofparanoia> kenshiro'd
[1:50:44] <radregice> ammonition
[1:50:45] <President_valentine> Enmies that appear like that are one and done
[1:50:45] <JayEarly> fists are based
[1:50:45] <Bonebagmel> Try blocking even if being hit by a flurry, you should start blocking right away.
[1:50:46] <amiavamp> don't worry you'll end up with tons of ammo
[1:50:56] <cartakus> Yokai realm
[1:50:57] <%PMAvers> They're basically like mini-bosses.
[1:51:06] <%valriot> Cant wait for Ippon Datara, all my nioh homies fuck with Ippon Datara
[1:51:10] <iamnuff> THat was his gardbreak
[1:51:16] <+aWanderingKaivo> some times you can get arrows from breaking crates and such
[1:51:16] <+JustToWatch> Pat have you tried blocking
[1:51:18] <soflicar> that kick gaurd crushes
[1:51:26] <captainnathaniel> Never block Youkai
[1:51:27] <+cheerfulnpc> @valriot Oh shit, that guy took me forever to figure out.
[1:51:30] <Bonebagmel> Same as in dark souls, some attacks you block others you dodge. You'll get a feel for it eventually.
[1:51:30] <%patriotrenegade> no just do it tho
[1:51:31] <JayEarly> ippon datara is always the coolest
[1:51:32] <andrei1h1> guard broken but alive is better than full stamina and dead
[1:51:33] <%Broand> In nioh 1 I spec'd into poison, which was oddly useful vs oni
[1:51:34] <iamnuff> You blocked his one guardbreak.
[1:51:37] <GhoulishCripple> Ippon Datara is my 2nd favorite Yokai Core ability. such a good weight
[1:51:37] <%Blank9> if you ki pulse in mid stance, you get a buff that makes your next guard take like no stamina
[1:51:44] <%valriot> Fist have the worst block as well if i remember
[1:51:45] <CrimsonGargoyle> i remember a game loading screen saying even when out of stamina you can block dextrously. i never tried it but i assume it's a la sekiro parrying
[1:51:47] <@GeneralSCPatton> This is one of the best Pat streams I've seen in a long time.
[1:51:50] <cartakus> The staff is problably the weirdest weapon, it splits into like four parts
[1:51:52] <cricket42069> You just need to eat more blueberries dude
[1:51:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat you got this
[1:51:54] <DXLelouch24> Chat shut up you dont block with fists,you dodge or parry
[1:51:55] <+RobertWayneLewis98> have you tried, ermmm not dying?
[1:51:58] <odnucaf3> You combed him and then he instantly killed you.
[1:51:58] <TigerCrownPorter> @Blank9 Thats not til he unlocks it
[1:51:59] <%holydeviant1> If you think this backseating is bad, you should see people trying to play that scrabble BR, it's hilarious
[1:52:00] <rReizs> you know how gwyns sword hits don't take much stamina to block and his kick takes a lot
[1:52:01] <sirrice77> @Blank9 are you sure thats not an upgrade?
[1:52:02] <IntrepidEye> blocking isn't worth it IMO. just dodge
[1:52:05] <+dougrayman> @PatStaresAt thats only for counter. nothing more
[1:52:07] <Vakojin> You use it to parry red attacks
[1:52:10] <stormhawk9891> Never said it was good, but it's there
[1:52:11] <%justcallmebobplease> Fuck I love Monster Hunter as a new entrant to the field - I can't not play it right now, as someone without a PS to play NIOH
[1:52:15] <President_valentine> High Kick
[1:52:18] <%Blank9> he got the upgrade for it, it's the first mid one
[1:52:19] <Zombrocom> That is only for red glowy attacks
[1:52:22] <Zombrocom> It does nothing otherwise
[1:52:27] <Laecerelius> You can start blockign in the middle of getting combo'd
[1:52:33] <+cheerfulnpc> Also don't underestimate low stance dodge, it's fast and cheap.
[1:52:35] <JayEarly> for some reason enemes just aren't doing the red burst attacks against you
[1:52:41] <%volitzern> I beat new game+ and never touched the block button lol
[1:52:41] <+cheerfulnpc> I switch to low stance specifically for dodging
[1:52:45] <%Dakuu75> guy's... he's been playing for like, an hour. Don't expect him to be a master of every mechanic right-off
[1:52:47] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Why does this game seem really fun, when Sekiro seems not as enjoyable? I feel like Sekrio just didn't hit the right notes for me.
[1:52:53] <@GeneralSCPatton> It has one use outside of counters, and that's cancelling out of the zero ki stun state
[1:52:56] <%superc37> @justcallmebobplease i mean both games are on pc too
[1:52:57] <amiavamp> Worth pointing out to reduce confusion, the big oni-looking yokai Pat fought is called a Yoki, yep it's 1 letter off from yokai, not confusing at all
[1:53:13] <%valriot> Block is really useful at NG+, my favourite build is green weight, with blue toughness, and youre just a tank
[1:53:17] <+cheerfulnpc> @amiavamp It's still a yokai, though.
[1:53:18] <+aWanderingKaivo> @NigelSchnauzerpug for one they are on pretty much opposite ends of the customization spectrum
[1:53:23] <%SovPho> i mean it's not confusing at all
[1:53:26] <StormSamurai8> @amiavamp Yup I confused that at first as well
[1:53:26] <%toolofparanoia> punched out all his blood
[1:53:30] <IntrepidEye> wait isn't blocking really shit regardless on low stance?
[1:53:33] <%holydeviant1> punchaman so hard his arm and head fly off
[1:53:34] <+darethsbane> sort by level
[1:53:36] <@GeneralSCPatton> R2 for compare
[1:53:38] <%AgniBrandt> @NigelSchnauzerpug Sekiro is a parrying game, full-stop. If you don't enjoy parrying as a playstyle it's not gonna click.
[1:53:40] <cartakus> I enjoy watching people be good at sekiro more than playing
[1:53:42] <%Blank9> you can also sprint while locked on, which helps dodging a ton
[1:53:43] <President_valentine> Fist him bro
[1:53:44] <amiavamp> blocking isn't affected by stance
[1:53:45] <+aWanderingKaivo> blocking is the same on every stance
[1:53:49] <+superchronicc> let the gacha begin
[1:53:50] <+shivhappy22> Battering ram skill carried my fist playthrough
[1:53:52] <Bonebagmel> Guarding in mid stance should reduce the ki-damage you reduce. (High is offense, mid is guard, low is dodge)
[1:53:52] <sirrice77> Click r3 to change sort
[1:53:53] <%Blank9> you can sort by level

[1:54:46] <cricket42069> sort by conehead
[1:54:50] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @NigelSchnauzerpug That might explain it. I don't hate parrying, but I don't get excited for it or even really attempt them.

[1:55:24] <+aWanderingKaivo> that hat is REALLY shiny
[1:55:25] <+RobertWayneLewis98> wow, there is no way you could look any cooler
[1:55:32] <soapyillusions7> Takedown 3 Fist move is the dopest move in the game.
[1:55:37] <President_valentine> Good thing this game has a great transmog
[1:55:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can get some cool sets fairly early in this game which is nice
[1:55:51] <cricket42069> tutorials for this game literally include lists of finger exercises
[1:55:52] <$lotharrio> Just gotta get new pants.

[2:04:16] <%RayReborne> More Purple Juice

[2:04:18] <kozboz96> @PatStaresAt pat look for a fist skill called battering ram triangle into battering ram MELTS human ki bars if i remember rightly
[2:04:20] <akitanito> you can lose more
[2:04:21] <GunneryGoblin> i didnt even know there was an english voice option in this game
[2:04:23] <President_valentine> I saved you asshole
[2:04:26] <+aWanderingKaivo> @JayEarly nope, you are Hideyoshi
[2:04:30] <DXLelouch24> The game names you
[2:04:37] <cartakus> The name of youtmr character is half the name of tokishiro or something?
[2:04:42] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[2:04:48] <DXLelouch24> @awanderingkaivo no you are half of Hideyoshi
[2:04:49] <sirrice77> @JayEarly No you're just Hide, it says so on the dagger
[2:04:53] <@GeneralSCPatton> Sniping archers is the best use of ammo
[2:05:06] <%PMAvers> That guy's found the one annoying sniping perch in a CoD map and will hold it forever.
[2:05:08] <cricket42069> toyotomi hideyoshi?
[2:05:08] <Huntercd> I wish the thong was available for players
[2:05:10] <+aWanderingKaivo> tokichiro was a nickname of the historical Hideyoshi so the game does this thing where it makes him a separate character yeah
[2:05:11] <cartakus> Ah yes hideyoshi
[2:05:33] <President_valentine> rock
[2:05:44] <Zombrocom> Thats the way
[2:05:45] <DXLelouch24> And you hang out with Nobunaga commiting war crimes
[2:05:52] <DXLelouch24> Nioh 2 s great

[2:06:35] <%skrewarrior> don't git gooed
[2:07:12] <Zombrocom> Antlers are great
[2:07:15] <+TopTieramisu> antlers are pretty cool
[2:07:18] <GunneryGoblin> antlers best horns agreed
[2:07:21] <cartakus> Bandits can turn into yokai though
[2:07:21] <%JokerNewby> I like that they let you custom your yokai
[2:07:22] <amiavamp> RE0 leeches
[2:07:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> You can customize all that in the character creator
[2:07:24] <+UKOrigin> youre an antler type bitch
[2:07:27] <iamnuff> I had to bring a buddy in here. This place sucked
[2:07:29] <%toolofparanoia> I'm not saying it's demons but it's demons
[2:07:30] <%Djinnazz> no

[2:07:32] <@GeneralSCPatton> You can actually pause
[2:07:32] <%skrewarrior> ye
[2:07:33] <cartakus> YES
[2:07:33] <+McSoliace> you can pause
[2:07:35] <Zombrocom> I don't think so
[2:07:35] <IntrepidEye> no
[2:07:36] <%Agami23> cant you just pause?
[2:07:36] <+rafaelba93> nah
[2:07:36] <Notorious_Mic> Yokia can be bandits as well

[2:07:37] <+Tucker0603> you go to last shrine
[2:07:37] <%tank7013> I think you can just pause
[2:07:38] <Hamborgini> you could just pause if you need to step away
[2:07:38] <+Jakeofalco> cant you pause?
[2:07:38] <silentshrug> you can just pause
[2:07:40] <TheChapyGuy> there's a proper pause

[2:08:07] <President_valentine> HAHAHA
[2:08:08] <stormhawk9891> WHAT THE FUCK
[2:08:08] <artoflec> that was patched into Nioh 1 later LUL
[2:08:08] <cricket42069> ayyy
[2:08:08] <%greasypete00> nioh is pretty cool with that
[2:08:09] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:08:09] <cartakus> BIG PAUSED
[2:08:10] <amiavamp> what is this "pause" you speak of? - dark souls
[2:08:10] <%RayReborne> lol Nioh one had that Kappa
[2:08:11] <UnImprest> eat that, dark souls
[2:08:14] <%vivaldiva> psaBlind
[2:08:14] <@Ranryu692> oh look, it's one of the things that Souls games desperately need
[2:08:15] <%Archmortal> Nioh 1 also has a real pause, yes
[2:08:16] <OneThousandTomatoes> pausing? in my video game?
[2:08:16] <@GeneralSCPatton> Perks of no invaders
[2:08:16] <Reveresao> PAUSE WUT
[2:08:16] <+pectusumbra> that's perfect, I also need a pee
[2:08:20] <stormhawk9891> I NEVER KNEW THIS
[2:08:22] <+Jakeofalco> just like last time
[2:08:25] <%PatchTheSquid> LUL
[2:08:34] <%PatchTheSquid> Game Changer
[2:08:34] <%MidnightPacif1c> psaDogchamp SourPls psaDogchamp
[2:08:38] <cartakus> There is only small pat
[2:08:39] <artoflec> miyazaki wont add a pause because it interferes with his great vision
[2:08:48] <Aussie_Manny> lytJIVE
[2:08:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> sekiro had a pause button by elden doesn't :(
[2:08:52] <%RayReborne> Man a real Pause button, I wonder what Series would highly benefit from a for real pause screen..............
[2:09:00] <President_valentine> small Pat is redundant
[2:09:00] <%notsoy> but they did add a pause in demon's souls...kind of
[2:09:08] <JohnnyJojo64> lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE
[2:09:14] <Aussie_Manny> ZANGIEF, DON'T DRINK THAT D:
[2:09:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> maybe thats why people say sekiro isn't a souls game, the pausing
[2:10:05] <Zombrocom> Invasions are the only reason you can't pause in souls
[2:10:14] <soapyillusions7> Is this Pop Team Epic?
[2:10:23] <cartakus> I though stamina was the main thing of a souls game
[2:10:25] <%PatchTheSquid> @OneThousandTomatoes I think it's more lack of player choice
[2:10:55] <TigerCrownPorter> @OneThousandTomatoes sekiro isn't a souls game cause... its sekiro... not dark souls series
[2:11:06] <Profmcstevie> Humanity Restored, Pause Function Destroyed
[2:11:18] <Aussie_Manny> Wait, Bloodborne isn't a Souls game?
[2:11:26] <+RobertWayneLewis98> The only soulslike I ever played was surge lol
[2:11:35] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Not even Dark Souls is a souls game.
[2:11:39] <cartakus> God I can't wait to try Ultra greatswords in ER
[2:11:52] <Aussie_Manny> chairVictory chairVictory chairVictory chairVictory
[2:12:13] <Hamborgini> Nioh 2 is my favorite "souls-like" precisely because it is the least "souls-like"

[2:12:25] <%PatchTheSquid> So how deep into Elden Ring do you think we will fing the Miura Tribute. theres no way Miyazaki doesn't do one.
[2:12:43] <Aussie_Manny> Dark Soils.
[2:12:52] <%notsoy> notsoy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 4 month streak! lucky seben? neat. when news of the VF5FS remaster came out, it made me think sega was saving the "kiryu in FG" bullet for VF6. maybe i'm just hoping they didn't keep kiryu out of tekken for shitty cosmetic DLC in a shitty port
[2:12:54] <cartakus> He seems to be into fingers now
[2:13:06] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @PatchTheSquid Hidden behind a waterfall with Skeletons
[2:13:08] <DragonOfWarZro> Nioh 2 also qol out its ass unlike soulsborne
[2:13:30] <%notsoy> soulsborne qol is shit, just like the quality of life of everybody in their settings
[2:13:43] <Aussie_Manny> i wonder if Elden Ring will have some good quality of life additions to its gameplay
[2:13:44] <President_valentine> The Nioh team actually listened to feedback
[2:14:03] <%crot454> crot454 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! yebebebebebebebebebebebe
[2:14:54] <DragonOfWarZro> Team ninja actually Goat
[2:15:26] <artoflec> i dont consider nioh soulslike really, there's so much that doesn't play or function like it.
[2:15:43] <IvanMistwalker> Nioh is a better souls game than Dark Souls Change My Mind
[2:15:47] <GilliamYaeger> It's more Ninja Gaiden than Souls, really
[2:15:53] <Hamborgini> nioh is the spiritual successor to onimusha as far as I'm concerned
[2:15:59] <%PatchTheSquid> Nioh 1 was a souls like, Nioh 2 is it's own thing for sure.
[2:16:04] <artoflec> yeah i mean it straight up just has ninja gaiden moves in it
[2:16:09] <captainnathaniel> Ninja Gaiden that uses souls leveling up system
[2:16:10] <+cheerfulnpc> @artoflec The shrine/bonfire system is pretty much identical, but it definitely plays very differently.
[2:16:11] <artoflec> nioh 1 wasn't soulslike either lol
[2:16:28] <+aWanderingKaivo> I've never played it but yeah I hear it compared to ninja gaiden more
[2:16:29] <Zombrocom> Yeah nioh and souls are pretty different games
[2:16:38] <DragonOfWarZro> You're right, its better
[2:16:39] <artoflec> like sure yeah the shrines, but even fuckin ninja gaiden had a shrine you go to and respawn at and would refill health
[2:16:42] <Zombrocom> It's more like... RPG ninja gaiden with diablo loot
[2:17:06] <artoflec> but i think the fact that its mission based makes it very different
[2:17:08] <cartakus> Nioh 1 and 2 have combo mad videos. That tells how away from souls they both are
[2:17:21] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I wasn't listening to Pat. Is he on a chocolate closet break?
[2:17:22] <+AntithesisEK> the tenchu may cry loot pinata
[2:17:23] <andrei1h1> it's obviously dark souls because you die when you get hit
[2:17:30] <+aWanderingKaivo> Nioh has TECH man lol
[2:17:33] <%RyTYoung> Hi Dr Pat!
[2:17:36] <%afronooch> whatd you get us?
[2:17:37] <+RobertWayneLewis98> obviously
[2:17:40] <TurtlesAndTentacles> hello doctor nick

[2:18:12] <ErikFeral> monke
[2:18:16] <+Mrbaconator> NFT DEMON
[2:18:18] <+Crunchy_the_clown> good spot to fight him
[2:18:24] <cartakus> Get real close to that motherfucker because he is everywhere
[2:18:25] <%RyTYoung> Embrace the monke
[2:18:33] <%notsoy> damn
[2:18:33] <%MooseIsGoose> he sucks to fight
[2:18:34] <+Jack8274> Ahh the first wall
[2:18:34] <President_valentine> Command grabbed
[2:18:35] <%Visorak6> this guy is for real
[2:18:36] <Vakojin> Break the horn.
[2:18:37] <fairore> omg
[2:18:39] <amiavamp> highly recommend keeping health topped off before engaging in fights
[2:18:39] <%valriot> Yokai Shift doesnt use stamina btw
[2:18:42] <TurtlesAndTentacles> gang stomp
[2:18:43] <%Paperware> Return to Monke
[2:18:44] <GunneryGoblin> yeah baiting him into the courtyard is always the play
[2:18:48] <Zombrocom> Might want to just cash in your devil trigger for that guy
[2:18:49] <IvanMistwalker> he is jittery as hell
[2:18:51] <+RobertWayneLewis98> what are you drinking?
[2:18:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> this game's fuckin hard
[2:18:53] <+JustToWatch> the spike kitties respawn
[2:18:55] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt when the throat singing starts shit gets real
[2:18:55] <+Jack8274> It's all about breaking the horn, it does massive posture
[2:18:58] <+cheerfulnpc> The monkeys took me ages to figure out their patterns
[2:19:05] <JayEarly> break his horn with high attacks
[2:19:10] <Sol_Install> how the nioh going?
[2:19:18] <%Logoth_> ew naruto run
[2:19:19] <SaltyAzteca> Dempsey Rollin Samurai!
[2:19:19] <+RobertWayneLewis98> nothin
[2:19:22] <Zombrocom> Their command grab is the tricky part, you have to dodge it super late
[2:19:29] <%MooseIsGoose> their smart
[2:19:34] <%notsoy> more like berserker barrage, with the claws and all
[2:19:36] <+cheerfulnpc> @Logoth_ Naruto wishes his run was that absurd
[2:19:58] <%Logoth_> ancient japanese technique of the dempsey roll
[2:20:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[2:20:14] <President_valentine> Get the shoulder tackle
[2:20:19] <cartakus> Anyone here that played nioh 2, what was your worst yokai to fight? Mine was problably the bird from last dlc and ninja yoki
[2:20:20] <amiavamp> Combo extender
[2:20:24] <Zombrocom> It's for the fists combo system
[2:20:28] <+Jack8274> It does MASSIVE posture damage if they are blocking
[2:20:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> ow my toe
[2:20:44] <Zombrocom> You can chain specials and moves for a stacking buff
[2:20:48] <%RayReborne> Foe dude Kappa
[2:20:53] <+HefestoForges> fracture toe LUL
[2:20:58] <+cheerfulnpc> @cartakus Haven't done the DLC yet, but the tengu have always given me grief.
[2:21:03] <+Jack8274> This was my build, I mained fists/Odachi Strength based
[2:21:16] <+aWanderingKaivo> @PatStaresAt the iaijutsu moves like that one on odachi can be used at the end of an attack chain as a ki pulse
[2:21:24] <%RayReborne> only goes off when landing it
[2:21:24] <JayEarly> ninja yoki are bullshit
[2:21:25] <+cheerfulnpc> @cartakus Oh, and the ippon datara
[2:21:28] <amiavamp> it doesn't work without an enemy to hit
[2:21:28] <+Jack8274> It can only be combo'd on a person
[2:21:28] <+Tucker0603> need to hit an enemy
[2:21:29] <cartakus> Tengu is a tank for damage but atleast he is kinda slow
[2:21:31] <%valriot> Needs to make contact
[2:21:32] <President_valentine> needs to be done on enemy
[2:21:32] <DragonOfWarZro> The old lady yokai from dlc 2 or 3
[2:21:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Oh cool pat is using the best weapon in the game
[2:21:35] <+HefestoForges> need enemy
[2:21:37] <Hamborgini> gotta have an enemy to enemy step off of
[2:21:46] <%RayReborne> thats what i said lol
[2:21:56] <%CatastropheCorvid> A bunch of combos wn't fire off unless you hit someone.
[2:22:04] <%Monkeyweed21> It’s enemy step
[2:22:27] <%CatastropheCorvid> Just got here, has he encountered all of the weapon types yet?
[2:22:31] <+Draegen_> woot, how goes the war vs the mindgoblins?
[2:22:44] <+JustToWatch> use odachi high stance to break horn
[2:22:44] <Jaysky> Is Pat enjoying Nioh 2 more than 1 so far?
[2:22:47] <+RobertWayneLewis98> stoopid monke
[2:22:52] <cartakus> Pat is only using fist and odashi
[2:22:53] <+aWanderingKaivo> Pat is winning against them
[2:22:59] <KatabolicRage> pretty sure your DT is full there
[2:23:06] <President_valentine> @jaysky Yes he is
[2:23:08] <+pectusumbra> is this not a time to pop your dt?
[2:23:31] <%crot454> monke
[2:23:31] <%CatastropheCorvid> @pectusumbra Nah, that's just an Enki.
[2:23:34] <President_valentine> That grab is a bitch
[2:23:38] <+RobertWayneLewis98> why arent you opening with your unga transformation?
[2:23:41] <Zombrocom> And they hate you too
[2:23:46] <%Monkeyweed21> You can break horns with high stance attacks btw
[2:23:46] <TerrifyingRei_05> monke
[2:23:47] <%AgniBrandt> Man I remember when Enki were scary
[2:23:53] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat with fists you can chain skills to do more dmg, even get a skill later that lowers the stamina usage
[2:23:54] <penitentpendant> If you don't return to Monke, they'll return... TO YOU
[2:23:55] <theshillman> better get used to them, these guys are everywhere
[2:23:57] <+Axellogic> monkeys take a bit to get used to
[2:23:57] <total_overkill> Pat stop playing like Darksouls... you need more Bloodborn aggro
[2:23:58] <+Jack8274> Nice
[2:23:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> oh no Garuda
[2:23:59] <%Bluwizard21> he must return to monkey
[2:23:59] <%CatastropheCorvid> Best way to kill heavy knockers is the parry.

[2:24:21] <President_valentine> @olm46 Fist are super good
[2:24:27] <amiavamp> They have to be knocked down
[2:24:27] <%CatastropheCorvid> @olm46 They're legit one of the best weapon types.
[2:24:27] <andrei1h1> only when they fall to the ground
[2:24:28] <%toolofparanoia> Unga bunga
[2:24:28] <krin_x> man when i played this i really thought fists would be my thing but i ended up liking tonfa scyth
[2:24:28] <GilliamYaeger> @olm46 Fists are objectively, without question, the best weapon in the game. They're just gimped because he can't get all the skills.
[2:24:29] <Hamborgini> they have to be in a "down" state
[2:24:30] <+Jack8274> That doesn't work for Yokai, you need to knock them down
[2:24:31] <mr_catsup> ave 2 ki bars
[2:24:31] <+darethsbane> for yokai you have to break their horns first
[2:24:33] <+greeam> you just have to keep wailing on them until they collaps
[2:24:35] <amiavamp> you gotta beat on them hard enough
[2:24:37] <%abrupt_abe> Yokai need a 2nd bar down essentially
[2:24:37] <captainnathaniel> need to knock them down
[2:24:38] <cartakus> You need to deplet red bar
[2:24:39] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt You need to drain their MAX stamina to get it
[2:24:39] <Hamborgini> yokai can fight with no stamina
[2:24:39] <+HefestoForges> you need them to have the red circle
[2:24:40] <Zombrocom> They have to fall over, just depleting a yokais stamina doesn't open them up for that
[2:24:41] <+TopTieramisu> that's humans. only when they're knocked down do you get a critical
[2:24:42] <+JustToWatch> The reticle has to be red
[2:24:43] <mr_catsup> They have a currect ki and a max ki
[2:24:43] <Vakojin> You need to destroy their ki with spirit attack too
[2:24:49] <JayEarly> they have two ki bars basically
[2:24:49] <TigerCrownPorter> They need to get downed. Have to break the ki twice basically
[2:24:49] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> they kneel
[2:24:51] <+aWanderingKaivo> the target lock reticule will be red
[2:24:51] <%RayReborne> red lock on circle gets big grapple
[2:24:54] <+AntithesisEK> yokai have technically two stamina bar
[2:24:55] <%MooseIsGoose> Have you looked at the split staff at all?
[2:24:56] <artoflec> they have white ki health and red ki health to put it in fighting terms too
[2:25:01] <DragonOfWarZro> You have to deplete their max ki
[2:25:02] <+cheerfulnpc> O"KEY" Do"KEY"
[2:25:04] <+Axellogic> Theres two states for yokai out of ki and out of MAX ki you deplete their max ki slower than their main ki
[2:25:04] <%tank7013> You need to deplete their max stamina to get them downed
[2:25:05] <koffeemancer> Bar has to empty purple then fill up with red
[2:25:09] <%JokerNewby> it took me a while to realize you can charge the hammer
[2:25:10] <%Monkeyweed21> @patstaresat you have to reduce their maximum ki bar to zero
[2:25:18] <%RayReborne> Divine rice time!
[2:25:19] <cartakus> Sell your shit
[2:25:21] <ToneBacas> kodama NFT
[2:25:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can sell excess low rarity items for elixirs and stuff
[2:25:25] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt yokai enemies are not the same as human in that regard. Humans just need to be ki broken, yokai need to be ki broken then broken again with more attacks before you can do that
[2:25:25] <%CatastropheCorvid> Oh he's JUST started. I'm not late.
[2:25:27] <+RobertWayneLewis98> isnt it obvious?!
[2:25:28] <%valriot> Infinite healing items
[2:25:29] <cartakus> For more shit
[2:25:31] <%RayReborne> you have 3
[2:25:35] <mr_catsup> After you brake the purple ki bar you gotta beat the red one out of them before they recover
[2:25:36] <+aWanderingKaivo> make an offering to get rice
[2:25:37] <%greasypete00> kodos bazaar adventure
[2:25:38] <+Jack8274> It's basically in mission items, you can't take them out of the mission
[2:25:39] <Zombrocom> Side note on yokai form: it's strongest effect is letting you use your yokai powers multiple times during it
[2:25:41] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat purify ailment helps with breaking their ki
[2:25:46] <penitentpendant> Kodama Fungible Tokens?
[2:25:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> Unique AI Generated Elixirs
[2:25:49] <akitanito> nodachi fungible tokens
[2:25:50] <+HefestoForges> you sell them items to get rice
[2:25:51] <%maskofmichael> invest now Pat
[2:25:53] <+RobertWayneLewis98> Kodama quartz
[2:25:54] <%RayReborne> you have exactly 3 rice Pat
[2:25:56] <GunneryGoblin> did you give your character a kodama tattoo anywhere?
[2:26:01] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> you can buy consumables so you can slay goblins
[2:26:02] <Hamborgini> kodama are all about the non-fungible bowls
[2:26:04] <JayEarly> they're not NFTs because they are desirable and useful
[2:26:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> The least fungible shit you've ever seen
[2:26:05] <total_overkill> Murder incoming
[2:26:13] <theshillman> trade in shit gear for rice, trade rice for heal refills
[2:26:20] <%MooseIsGoose> Invest in the ubisoft kodama shrine nft
[2:26:20] <andrei1h1> go back to first boss now maybe?
[2:26:20] <%tank7013> Your 3 rice could become 300 rice. Link the fire now
[2:26:25] <%transporterthesequel> god I love fist
[2:26:41] <Jaysky> Yeah fisting is cool
[2:26:42] <%transporterthesequel> Oh did pat kill Tarus Demon?
[2:26:43] <andrei1h1> yes
[2:26:44] <TheMadBadger> Ah, i see Pat chose the best weapons
[2:26:45] <cartakus> Fuck that voice
[2:26:45] <+Jack8274> I loved the fists so much when I played
[2:26:45] <Jaysky> I love fisting
[2:26:47] <%RayReborne> Kappa and i was just making an observation too
[2:26:47] <President_valentine> Yup
[2:26:49] <captainnathaniel> nah
[2:26:51] <%Monkeyweed21> Selling shit for Xp gives divine rice eventually you can just get 999 rice and can auto buy elixirs
[2:26:54] <%tank7013> Yea
[2:26:55] <TheMadBadger> Yes
[2:26:56] <zettig> Yes

[2:27:12] <+pectusumbra> I mean that's a walk but if you want to
[2:27:13] <theshillman> if you'd like
[2:27:13] <JayEarly> does Woolie know about the ancient Japanese Dempsey rolls?
[2:27:13] <@GeneralSCPatton> Wreck his shit
[2:27:15] <+Mrbaconator> LUL
[2:27:15] <%holydeviant1> I mean, the distant war drums and ominous sensation weren't clue enough
[2:27:16] <%toolofparanoia> Go and fist him
[2:27:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> just fight the actual boss
[2:27:21] <+Jack8274> You can always come back at any time
[2:27:22] <%RayReborne> if you replay the mission he's still there, you could just coke back. its an achievo
[2:27:22] <Hamborgini> yeah, if you want to. You're strong enough for sure.
[2:27:23] <%maskofmichael> LUL
[2:27:27] <%RayReborne> come*
[2:27:31] <%RyTYoung> There's no real reason to, just for the souls
[2:27:34] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt You can just replay the mission for that
[2:27:37] <%PatchTheSquid> first "boss" sure.
[2:27:53] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat you can just replay the mission after
[2:28:05] <%skrewarrior> @PatStaresAt there will be a seprate side mission where you go fight that guy
[2:28:14] <+aWanderingKaivo> first boss is good practice for second though
[2:28:23] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt is this a full LP?
[2:28:23] <DragonOfWarZro> His soulcore is OP tho
[2:28:29] <%PatchTheSquid> It's not a boss LUL
[2:28:34] <DXLelouch24> Pat this is a mind goblin, fight him after
[2:28:40] <DragonOfWarZro> Big and strong
[2:28:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> That fucking horse boss kicked my ass but I beat him
[2:28:44] <+Jack8274> Getting 200 toughness should be your first goal, it's 47 Dark souls 1 poise equivalent

[2:32:20] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt I can't remember if the game straight-up tells you this, so I hope this helps: When you damage a Yokai's ki, you also damage their max Ki. When they're in the red (no Ki_ every attack staggers them. When their max ki hits 0, you can do a finisher.

[2:35:26] <Essixian> COLD OPEN
[2:35:26] <ScreamLord> Saying "Hanyou Half-Blood" is like saying "A canine dog" redundant
[2:35:27] <Zombrocom> Now go murder that bull
[2:35:27] <JayEarly> I swear that guy's voice is in the Witcher
[2:35:34] <+Jack8274> This already has a much better impression on pat
[2:35:35] <cartakus> Some uninportant guy
[2:35:38] <%Agami23> if you know about nobunaga lore you would get who that guy was right away
[2:35:39] <Sol_Install> yea
[2:35:42] <%crot454> hows the game feel to you pat?

[2:35:48] <Kghaleon> DEX breaks this game, I got my Ninjutsu damage up 400+ and I practically one shot bosses now.
[2:35:49] <%JoshManVGH> You copies his NFT!
[2:35:49] <@GeneralSCPatton> He's just some guy who definitely wasn't historically important
[2:35:49] <%athuramn> @patstaresat after having beat the first level, thoughts on how this game feels over the first?
[2:35:51] <Zombrocom> You acquired "Monke"
[2:35:51] <%JokerNewby> return to monke

[2:35:56] <%EynoStiles> Is the witcher good?
[2:36:00] <blackbaron98> the voice acting world is small
[2:36:01] <+Jack8274> And the new summon you got is legit
[2:36:03] <+Axellogic> a bunch of the Voice Actors in this are the ones that do FF14 you may have heard them there
[2:36:04] <%Agami23> like knowing japanese lore from a certain point makes alot of this story obvious
[2:36:04] <ScreamLord> Return to Thunda Monke

[2:36:20] <+aWanderingKaivo> its recycling
[2:36:21] <sirrice77> @Kghaleon was the when the game launched cuz it got nerfed. Still good though from what i hear
[2:36:21] <@GeneralSCPatton> Gives Shiftling Proficiency
[2:36:22] <+ThomasOfTroy> Hiddy stands for "himbo buddy"
[2:36:23] <+HefestoForges> you get juice
[2:36:23] <+Axellogic> you get alot of soul cores
[2:36:24] <%tank7013> Because you can't arry infinite of them

[2:36:25] <%CatastropheCorvid> To raise your Shiftling level
[2:36:26] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt Deleting them gives you shiftling skill points
[2:36:26] <+rafaelba93> you will get tons of them

[2:36:32] <+Jack8274> You get A LOT of these
[2:36:32] <%Paperware> It takes up inventory space
[2:36:33] <%RayReborne> Shiftling points for stronger Yokai Stats
[2:36:34] <zettig> You get duplicates
[2:36:34] <%crot454> honestly that mezuki core carried me for a min
[2:36:35] <Zombrocom> Eventually you will have more cores than you know what to do with
[2:36:35] <GilliamYaeger> You get a LOT of them and most are junk
[2:36:36] <+aWanderingKaivo> you have 2
[2:36:38] <cartakus> Season 2 of witcher was so boring
[2:36:39] <DragonOfWarZro> Gives yokai bucks
[2:36:39] <%MooseIsGoose> both are equipped
[2:36:41] <%Blank9> souls have levels, they're like equipment drops
[2:36:44] <ElSuperNova> You'll have a bunch soon enough
[2:36:45] <+aWanderingKaivo> ?
[2:36:47] <soyball> you did, just removed them
[2:36:49] <%JoshManVGH> Soul core Upgrade materials can be gained by deleting duplicate soul cors.

[2:36:54] <%CatastropheCorvid> Or Square
[2:36:55] <DXLelouch24> Because their are bad soul cores Pat
[2:37:00] <+darethsbane> at the shrine under manage soul cores you can lock them i believe
[2:37:03] <DXLelouch24> Also for xp
[2:37:06] <%Tragosavich> Nioh makes me feel like a crazy person explaining the mechanics
[2:37:06] <+rafaelba93> you will get so much cores, dont bother locking them
[2:37:12] <+Jack8274> That one heals you when you kill enemies
[2:37:14] <%Bread_Assassin> Can you get doubles of them?
[2:37:24] <amiavamp> The queen of england wants your stones
[2:37:28] <@GeneralSCPatton> Shiftling skills are really good, so you'll want to liquidate trash cores
[2:37:28] <+SilverDevilfish> Magic Rock
[2:37:31] <%PMAvers> You *can* get doubles.
[2:37:32] <%skrewarrior> what do amrita actually do?
[2:37:36] <Kghaleon> @sirrice77 DEX still lets you kill bosses in 10 seconds
[2:37:36] <+JFKRobot> Pat, have you gotten over your aversion to using rare consumables or do you still hoard them until the game is over?
[2:37:39] <%chance_h> Talking about the Witcher, now that season 2 dropped, Joseph Anderson must dedicate another 6 months for the next episode of his review
[2:37:41] <captainnathaniel> really needed to play on english?
[2:37:41] <+SilverDevilfish> Magic
[2:37:44] <%JoshManVGH> Some English dude learned about and stole a ghost with form a scottish man.
[2:37:46] <cartakus> I think the only bad thing about this game is that there are hidden combat skills you have to farm for
[2:37:49] <sirrice77> @Kghaleon ah alright cool
[2:37:52] <Zombrocom> Amrita is bullshit magic plot material don't worry about it
[2:37:52] <+JustToWatch> @skrewarrior magic bullshit
[2:37:54] <+TopTieramisu> ye
[2:37:54] <DXLelouch24> This is a prequel
[2:37:56] <+aWanderingKaivo> @skrewarrior magic shit, morph you into yokai, etc
[2:37:59] <%athuramn> @skrewarrior it's crystallized magic to gain power
[2:38:03] <cartakus> Also fuck this voice

[2:38:04] <DragonOfWarZro> They give you more POWER
[2:38:05] <+Local16> You and your new bff are war profiteers
[2:38:09] <%Tragosavich> Wait this game has a dub?  I put like a couple hours in this game and never realized there was an option for that
[2:38:10] <+bravofifeniner> BUNGO TIME
[2:38:13] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> My god, he is SUPER british. I love it.
[2:38:15] <+aWanderingKaivo> you will see yokai'd out soldiers later
[2:38:20] <+JustToWatch> there are hidden treasures ON the map
[2:38:22] <%holydeviant1> "Aren't there ethical concerns to being what amounts to a supernatural arms dealer?"  "Naaaaah, let's make money!"
[2:38:22] <jorniev> should pat play bannerlords 2?
[2:38:23] <+AlucardX60> This guy has Patches vibes.
[2:38:24] <%Blank9> this was the beta level
[2:38:28] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat this is a prequel to Nioh 1
[2:38:28] <ErikFeral> this sounds like Crocodile Hunter dealing with Yokai. "This here's a Red Oni! Imma wrestle the club outta his hands!"
[2:38:32] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> the best kinda of profiteer
[2:38:38] <Doomed2Die> yoooooo

[2:40:18] <+JustToWatch> TRAMBAMPOLINE
[2:40:22] <%valriot> Yes, offer it all
[2:40:23] <%RayReborne> WHITE GARBAGE LEAVES

[2:40:28] <efratzy> ye
[2:40:29] <Zombrocom> Yeah sure
[2:40:29] <amiavamp> Either offer or disassemble, but disassemble isn't available
[2:40:30] <GunneryGoblin> convert trash gear into KodamaKoin
[2:40:30] <+rafaelba93> burn it all exept equiped itens
[2:40:30] <+pectusumbra> there's probably an auto-sell
[2:40:31] <cartakus> Nioh 1 ryu can drop izuna for sword skill
[2:40:32] <twistedhands> offer all of it
[2:40:32] <%RayReborne> Kappa
[2:40:32] <+JustToWatch> offer all the white stuff
[2:40:34] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt the plot of this game is you are basically Drebin from MGS4
[2:40:34] <artoflec> you can select by low rarity and just keep your purples
[2:40:35] <+aWanderingKaivo> you'll get divine rice, amrita, and elixirs
[2:40:37] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Offerings give you souls
[2:40:44] <%RayReborne> and a shit ton of Rice
[2:40:47] <Zombrocom> Ya now have RICE
[2:40:50] <%barrakuta371> sell trash get item
[2:40:52] <DragonOfWarZro> You bang nobu soon, okay?
[2:40:58] <+aWanderingKaivo> spirit stones are like consumable souls you prolly have some
[2:41:01] <Hamborgini> could pop a spirit stone to get enough for a level
[2:41:04] <%RayReborne> AUTO SOULS BACK
[2:41:11] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> ELMO
[2:41:12] <@GeneralSCPatton> Do you have enough spirit stones to level up?
[2:41:15] <JayEarly> I thank you have stones to burn
[2:41:19] <amiavamp> They got rid of the Spirit stat from Nioh 1
[2:41:25] <+aWanderingKaivo> it unlocks the grey skill
[2:41:27] <DXLelouch24> Your basically a mercenary for hire hanging out with Nobunaga commiting war crimes
[2:41:30] <KatabolicRage> For that SPECIFIC grayed out ability to activate
[2:41:33] <%RayReborne> well two more in either stat yeah
[2:41:34] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt Yokai ability damage is for your monkey spear
[2:41:39] <%PMAvers> Only like two points, you can probably toss a couple in for that big buff.
[2:41:41] <ErikFeral> Feral Spirits are kindred spirits to me
[2:41:42] <Hamborgini> this game rewards spreading stats out (up to a point, at least)
[2:41:46] <%RayReborne> for the greyed out stats ye
[2:41:46] <andrei1h1> get all stats to like 20 or something, that's how you get to use anything
[2:41:49] <%valriot> Theres no down side to using magic and injutsu in this
[2:41:54] <defaultname3887> you kinda want all stats at a very low minimun and by the end game your maximun stats dwarf them
[2:42:00] <shiny_prinny> they make you spread your stats a bit to get all the effects of a guardian spirit
[2:42:05] <+rafaelba93> gobling
[2:42:07] <+JFKRobot> Hey chat - any issue with buying Nioh 2 through EGS rather than steam? Obviously on sale through epic
[2:42:11] <%Agami23> you ready to get over some other goblins?
[2:42:14] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah getting all stats up a bit to 20ish is actually good here
[2:42:14] <%Broand> Oh figure out what that weird cat was
[2:42:14] <DragonOfWarZro> Nobunaga did nothing wrong
[2:42:15] <+rafaelba93> GOBLING KILL THE GOBLING
[2:42:15] <efratzy> its even worse when you have to scroll to get them unmarked
[2:42:21] <Vakojin> It means it just need to get the threshold when you add the stats.
[2:42:21] <total_overkill> OCD ! icons Pat, worse part of the game... as is there forever
[2:42:26] <+SilverDevilfish> The ! triggers the OCD hard
[2:42:27] <ToneBacas> enema?
[2:42:30] <cricket42069> there'
[2:42:32] <Latija> in darkness looms the spider lily
[2:42:33] <+aWanderingKaivo> damage scaling isn't super impactful or important early
[2:42:36] <%AgniBrandt> Summoner's candle deletes the corpse run
[2:42:38] <olm46> Increase the enemas.
[2:42:39] <Zombrocom> Summnor's candle is basically just, get your bloodstain back for free
[2:42:41] <Hamborgini> summoner's candle makes the corpse run to you instead of the usual way it works
[2:42:41] <cricket42069> there's also the hidden items on the map
[2:42:48] <+pectusumbra> looks like you need 2 points?
[2:42:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah
[2:42:52] <+rafaelba93> YEP
[2:42:54] <%athuramn> YEAG
[2:42:54] <@GeneralSCPatton> Summoner's Candle is for when you really want your bloodstain back because it's full of shit
[2:42:55] <GunneryGoblin> isnt nioh 2 great
[2:42:55] <%RayReborne> We told you Kappa
[2:42:56] <TheMadBadger> Yup!
[2:42:56] <cartakus> YA THINK?!
[2:42:58] <%valriot> YEP
[2:42:58] <+Local16> Yup
[2:43:00] <penitentpendant> Praise the QoL!
[2:43:02] <%athuramn> this is why we said skip nioh 1
[2:43:09] <primaryfire> explain familiarity
[2:43:11] <TranquiloArman> Nioh 2 much like Mega Man 2 is just a straight upgrade
[2:43:12] <+Jack8274> Later on you can adjust scaling like Dark Souls 3
[2:43:12] <%Agami23> the only thing that confused me was how to get magic points and ninja points early on
[2:43:12] <@Ranryu692> if there's one thing I know about Team Ninja with regards to this game, it's that they listen to feedback
[2:43:16] <+bugz_munny> nioh 1 is nonsense
[2:43:17] <%RayReborne> Fists also scale with dex slightly
[2:43:17] <@Lion_kun> WE TOLD YOU IT WAS BETTER PAT
[2:43:18] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt Hover your cursor over what look like possible significant landmarks on the map. Gates and mountains, lakes and villages. Game doesn't tell you this, but you can find hidden things.
[2:43:19] <+aWanderingKaivo> it really is such an improvement
[2:43:20] <+bugz_munny> I remember nothing
[2:43:20] <Zombrocom> When the thing turns red
[2:43:22] <%CatastropheCorvid> Ye!
[2:43:25] <%Blank9> and they spell disaster for you
[2:43:26] <Hamborgini> red cursor is a hidden item
[2:43:26] <amiavamp> The controller vibrates and the icon turns red when you mouse over one
[2:43:28] <+JustToWatch> where it turns red
[2:43:29] <%CatastropheCorvid> Sorry for double post.
[2:43:30] <%RayReborne> feel the vibrations
[2:43:33] <cricket42069> cursor turn red
[2:43:37] <JayEarly> when the cursor is red
[2:43:38] <%Tragosavich> It would vibrate on the controller
[2:43:38] <@GeneralSCPatton> When cursor turns red. Just random goodies.
[2:43:43] <Zombrocom> When the cursor turns red
[2:43:43] <andrei1h1> there is
[2:43:46] <%Agami23> there is
[2:43:47] <%JoshManVGH> Wait what!?
[2:43:47] <%RayReborne> red cursor
[2:43:49] <%CatastropheCorvid> Top middle
[2:43:50] <+JustToWatch> there is
[2:43:55] <zettig> cursor turn red
[2:43:56] <cricket42069> you touched two already lol
[2:43:58] <+aWanderingKaivo> @primaryfire use a weapon a lot, bar fills up, you get to do a bit more damage, is also used in crafting you don't need to worry about till ng+
[2:43:58] <%CatastropheCorvid> Yay!
[2:43:58] <primaryfire> just info on historic landmarks
[2:44:06] <%ClericOfSparda> Ochako
[2:44:09] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> ForneusAtSeaWorld subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! Hey pat hope everythings cool. Niohs great. Remember to use your yokai abilities they regen pretty fast.
[2:44:17] <amiavamp> Yes
[2:44:18] <Zombrocom> Yes
[2:44:18] <+aWanderingKaivo> yesx
[2:44:19] <%MooseIsGoose> yes
[2:44:19] <TheMadBadger> Yes
[2:44:19] <GemeSvev> Yes
[2:44:20] <+darethsbane> yes
[2:44:20] <Hamborgini> it does
[2:44:21] <primaryfire> @awanderingkaivo yea just referencing the first nioh stream
[2:44:21] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt Yes
[2:44:21] <sirrice77> yes
[2:44:21] <efratzy> yes
[2:44:22] <President_valentine> Yup
[2:44:22] <+JustToWatch> yes
[2:44:22] <%MooseIsGoose> possible
[2:44:22] <%JoshManVGH> Yep!
[2:44:23] <ferbeholds> yes
[2:44:23] <%skrewarrior> yes
[2:44:23] <+rafaelba93> i played thos for 50 houres and never knew the map shit
[2:44:24] <%TenraiDaze> aye
[2:44:24] <cartakus> Shortcut also
[2:44:24] <@GeneralSCPatton> Yep, different monster
[2:44:24] <%blaccbird914> yes
[2:44:24] <DXLelouch24> Huh i missed this
[2:44:25] <amiavamp> He has a pretty good one
[2:44:25] <Mr_Rakjo> yes
[2:44:25] <+Axellogic> yes they are different enemies
[2:44:26] <%RayReborne> yes, he has a different move
[2:44:28] <Zombrocom> It's different, and it's one of the best in the game
[2:44:29] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt But it'll appear later too
[2:44:30] <sirrice77> The 1st is a charge, the boss was a sweep
[2:44:31] <DragonOfWarZro> Slightly
[2:44:33] <+JFKRobot> Hey chat - any issue with buying Nioh 2 through EGS rather than steam? Obviously on sale through epic
[2:44:33] <andrei1h1> it might not drop it every time tho
[2:44:35] <+aWanderingKaivo> @primaryfire oh lol gotcha
[2:44:38] <%CatastropheCorvid> Grinding is super viable in NIOH 2
[2:44:39] <TsunTsuchinoko> If he drops his core, yes
[2:44:40] <%Paperware> Yeah, he's a different enemy, but you may not get the core
[2:44:41] <+Axellogic> The bull skill is actually one of my favorite in the game
[2:44:42] <%Felhad> every yokai has a unique move
[2:44:43] <%JoshManVGH> Go kill that horses brother!
[2:44:45] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> it a big tackle
[2:44:46] <RumonGray> Yep, this game's like Aria of Sorrow, every yokai enemy has a soul
[2:44:47] <DXLelouch24> Yes
[2:44:48] <Kghaleon> They have levels, so within a few stages it will get outclassed by stronger yokai abilities
[2:44:52] <%PatchTheSquid> If he drops it, Yeah
[2:44:52] <amiavamp> Also you can skip half the level after beating him
[2:44:53] <%CatastropheCorvid> Running Twilight missions can get you a lot of stuff.
[2:44:55] <TheMadBadger> Yokai upgrades, yes
[2:45:00] <@GeneralSCPatton> Find the one that gives Realm Resistances
[2:45:01] <maddogshimano> making me wanna replay this pat
[2:45:01] <DXLelouch24> Every yokai has an ability
[2:45:05] <%RayReborne> you have all of those lol
[2:45:14] <DXLelouch24> Nioh of Sorrow
[2:45:37] <+aWanderingKaivo> I really like the ones that heal you on burst counter and on picking up soul cores
[2:45:37] <DragonOfWarZro> Gozuki soul is great for reducing max ki
[2:45:39] <thunderborn32> oh god, is that a sphere grid?
[2:45:42] <Zombrocom> Yeah, it is very igavania
[2:45:47] <RumonGray> @DXLelouch24 literally, it's so good
[2:45:48] <cartakus> Guess I gonna use daily xp for ninja them hop on nioh 2 for a while more
[2:45:59] <ToneBacas> leave the Elmo alone
[2:46:11] <%PMAvers> Some of them have multiple ranks inside the same sphere.
[2:46:15] <Zombrocom> I love the ones that reduce the dark realm penalties
[2:46:17] <@GeneralSCPatton> Build towards Realm Resistances
[2:46:18] <%MooseIsGoose> the damage taking one
[2:46:21] <stormhawk9891> Shiftling is mainly Extending DT and reducing Dark Realm penalties
[2:46:26] <%Tragosavich> You have to get the first one first to unlock the others
[2:46:27] <%RayReborne> yokai form duration is great
[2:46:28] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt One of them is for stamina recovery speed in yokai realm
[2:46:30] <+aWanderingKaivo> duration of yokai shift is good if you like using it
[2:46:31] <amiavamp> Active Skills are good to work toward
[2:46:32] <Kghaleon> You get more skill points by using things, it's not tied to your leveling
[2:46:36] <koffeemancer> reducing ki penalty in yokai realms is helpful
[2:46:39] <MechanizedGentleman> gimped, respec now
[2:46:41] <+aWanderingKaivo> makes your 'healthbar' bigger
[2:46:49] <+Axellogic> learn ki pulse while dodging
[2:46:53] <primaryfire> the mid ki pulse one is really good
[2:46:54] <TerrifyingRei_05> because anime
[2:46:55] <+Axellogic> or dont again
[2:46:56] <cartakus> Ninja stuff
[2:46:59] <%RayReborne> attack boost yeyeye
[2:47:02] <shiny_prinny> that's running water
[2:47:04] <%Tragosavich> What weapons are you running?
[2:47:04] <DeathByPoke7> is running water man the new mega man boss
[2:47:05] <+Axellogic> its the water thing
[2:47:05] <+aWanderingKaivo> running water man was the mid stance one
[2:47:06] <%RayReborne> those are next
[2:47:10] <+Axellogic> its on all three stances
[2:47:25] <+aWanderingKaivo> yup
[2:47:25] <Zombrocom> It's doing the level again yeah
[2:47:31] <@GeneralSCPatton> Missions are always a full reset
[2:47:31] <GunneryGoblin> you're replaying the mission, not going back to the area
[2:47:33] <+Tucker0603> well duh
[2:47:33] <Kghaleon> Except your Kodami.
[2:47:33] <TheMadBadger> Yeah, you're playing the level again
[2:47:36] <Hamborgini> farm item drops if you wanna
[2:47:37] <%moonmintparadise> You can set "Goals" on skills so it tells you when you have the points for them
[2:47:38] <amiavamp> it's the whole level again, but it auto skips cutscenes (unless you turn that off)
[2:47:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah, you are re-clearing the level from scratch
[2:47:40] <+aWanderingKaivo> the map is level select not a world map
[2:47:44] <@GeneralSCPatton> Time is convoluted
[2:47:46] <Zombrocom> Yeah, except kodama
[2:47:50] <%AgniBrandt> They're discrete levels that reset when you come back
[2:47:50] <scrumbotime> Yeah its not a zone of the world, it's a level
[2:47:50] <%PMAvers> But the levels of everything should still be the same and you're way better geared now.
[2:48:00] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> the optional boss gives a shortcut key
[2:48:23] <Kghaleon> There are items like spider lily that restore your anima gauge
[2:48:29] <%moonmintparadise> that is a lot of health
[2:48:35] <amiavamp> yeye fuck him up
[2:48:38] <primaryfire> he's getting it!
[2:48:48] <Zombrocom> Yeheyehyeh
[2:48:49] <%RayReborne> YEYEYYE
[2:48:55] <+aWanderingKaivo> sick
[2:49:00] <%TenraiDaze> nice horn break
[2:49:00] <olm46> That's the horn-killer
[2:49:06] <ferbeholds> headshot

[2:49:10] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> yeah
[2:49:10] <%barrakuta371> psaSmug psaSmug psaSmug psaSmug
[2:49:10] <GunneryGoblin> get his ass!
[2:49:12] <TheMadBadger> He's beginning to believe...
[2:49:28] <%PatchTheSquid> You're doing it Peter!
[2:50:17] <@GeneralSCPatton> Very nice
[2:50:18] <%moonmintparadise> this is yank as fuck but super hype
[2:50:20] <JayEarly> are you invincible during the whole monkey animation?
[2:50:22] <%TenraiDaze> 👏
[2:50:22] <TheMadBadger> Oh he didn't drop it
[2:50:24] <%RayReborne> ye
[2:50:24] <sirrice77> no core booo
[2:50:26] <@GeneralSCPatton> Shortcut
[2:50:26] <%Bluwizard21> just a shortcut door
[2:50:28] <shiny_prinny> unlucky, didn't drop the soul core
[2:50:29] <Zombrocom> Dang, he didn't drop his core
[2:50:32] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> shortcut
[2:50:34] <TheMadBadger> @JayEarly Nope.
[2:50:37] <DXLelouch24> @jayearly no
[2:50:38] <+Crunchy_the_clown> yeah
[2:50:39] <%RayReborne> yes
[2:50:43] <%MooseIsGoose> It unlocks the gate in this arena
[2:50:43] <%RayReborne> lmao
[2:50:44] <cartakus> Core is ramdom
[2:50:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[2:50:45] <andrei1h1> only the main boss is 100%
[2:50:45] <President_valentine> We did
[2:50:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> wooo rng
[2:50:49] <mr_catsup> Only main bosses are guarantee
[2:50:50] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You will get plenty
[2:50:51] <RumonGray> only the boss cores are guaranteed yeah
[2:50:52] <%Visorak6> it was still a good test!
[2:50:53] <@Lion_kun> Just try again
[2:50:55] <Kghaleon> They have levels, so you find better ones anyway.
[2:50:56] <%RayReborne> mission bosses are guanrefor the first time through
[2:50:56] <amiavamp> no
[2:50:59] <artoflec> i was gonna say it but you already went into the mission elaSmile
[2:50:59] <GunneryGoblin> you'll be getting soul cores out the ass by the middle of next level
[2:51:00] <mr_catsup> the rest are drops
[2:51:01] <DXLelouch24> Cores are rng
[2:51:01] <President_valentine> no
[2:51:02] <shiny_prinny> no
[2:51:02] <%Tragosavich> Shouldnt come back
[2:51:03] <toahmes> Pat you'll see him in more than just this mission
[2:51:03] <+JustToWatch> no
[2:51:03] <cartakus> Fuck you buddy
[2:51:04] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> no
[2:51:06] <%Djinnazz> if you leave
[2:51:10] <+aWanderingKaivo> there is a side mission with JUST this boss you will unlock soon so you can just farm that if you want it, its a good drop rate
[2:51:10] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> nope
[2:51:11] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt only miniboss and boss core are 100%
[2:51:13] <scrumbotime> No he's a one and done until you come back
[2:51:15] <Kghaleon> Big foes don't respawn
[2:51:16] <twistedhands> you'll fight more of him
[2:51:17] <%holydeviant1> No. It's annother mind goblin!
[2:51:18] <DXLelouch24> Aria of Sorrow Pat
[2:51:26] <+charp35> Just reselect the level if you want to fight him again
[2:51:26] <DXLelouch24> Of course its random
[2:51:29] <%Tragosavich> You will runinto him again
[2:51:33] <%Visorak6> He's like Taurus Demon, you'll see him again
[2:51:36] <MechanizedGentleman> just burn a bonfire ascetic and fight him again Kappa
[2:51:46] <Zombrocom> You can farm him later, don't worry about it
[2:51:57] <amiavamp> Rising Gale lets you attack while ki pulsing so you have a never ending combo while regening ki
[2:52:00] <cartakus> Combo extender
[2:52:00] <%MaritimeFox> Baffled by the Sphere Grid??
[2:52:00] <%Visorak6> mobile ki pulse
[2:52:00] <scrumbotime> oooh ki pulse but keep in their face
[2:52:01] <Hamborgini> turns ki pulse into a combo extending attack
[2:52:01] <%RayReborne> Restores Ki while combo continues
[2:52:01] <+Jack8274> That one is amazing! keeps up the pressure for freee
[2:52:02] <shiny_prinny> that's hold forward during ki pulse for a hit
[2:52:04] <President_valentine> that's super useful
[2:52:10] <TheMadBadger> Knifehand good
[2:52:14] <olm46> Stomp your feet like a baby would
[2:52:18] <Zombrocom> That other one makes your ki pulse an attack
[2:52:23] <+McSoliace> ki pulse has a hit
[2:52:25] <cartakus> Bitch slap
[2:52:27] <GilliamYaeger> @PatStaresAt It makes your Ki pulses into an attack
[2:52:30] <%athuramn> the ki pulse one is a gap closer
[2:52:38] <Kghaleon> Ninjutsu heron feathers are OP later.
[2:52:39] <%RayReborne> Ki pulse attack, continue Unga
[2:52:41] <President_valentine> its really good
[2:52:44] <amiavamp> Have to leave using an item
[2:52:48] <sirrice77> use the branch
[2:52:48] <shiny_prinny> divine branch or beat the level
[2:52:50] <cartakus> Finish mission
[2:52:50] <andrei1h1> the branch key item
[2:52:51] <%Tragosavich> Have yo use an item
[2:52:51] <President_valentine> its an item
[2:52:52] <Hamborgini> divine branch
[2:52:53] <scrumbotime> Beat the level or use the item to leave
[2:52:54] <%RayReborne> use the good branch
[2:52:57] <%Djinnazz> yup
[2:52:57] <+charp35> use the branch in your inventory
[2:52:58] <@GeneralSCPatton> Spend your souls and then use the branch fragment
[2:53:02] <+aWanderingKaivo> I think you keep items gained though right
[2:53:02] <ArgentUndaCova> Use this item called Himigori Branch
[2:53:04] <%Tragosavich> level up at shrine first
[2:53:05] <+JustToWatch> kill 1 guy your almost at level up
[2:53:07] <shiny_prinny> could grind out a level then leave
[2:53:09] <soflicar> get enough to level
[2:53:10] <Zombrocom> Or just kill the boss
[2:53:10] <mr_catsup> SPEEDRUN
[2:53:10] <+aWanderingKaivo> or you can just beat the level lol
[2:53:12] <Kghaleon> If you spend them or level up it won't matter lol
[2:53:12] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> level up and leave
[2:53:14] <TsunTsuchinoko> you could finish da mission
[2:53:24] <%RayReborne> ye
[2:53:26] <Zombrocom> Could just sprint to the boss
[2:53:26] <TheMadBadger> Big brain play
[2:53:30] <+ALazo> run to the end and kill boss
[2:53:33] <Huntercd> Gief speaks
[2:53:33] <mr_catsup> So no speedrun D:
[2:53:38] <+ALazo> do the dark souls shuffle
[2:53:38] <+pectusumbra> see where that key opens?
[2:53:43] <%barrakuta371> zentreKEK
[2:53:44] <cartakus> Why don't you try a new weapon type?
[2:53:58] <%athuramn> did he just herbal remedy himself
[2:54:07] <+JustToWatch> I would not have the branch on your quick menu, in case you panic and fuck up
[2:54:10] <+aWanderingKaivo> slowish but cool
[2:54:11] <Zombrocom> It's expensive though
[2:54:13] <%RayReborne> BIG range, real good
[2:54:15] <amiavamp> The big swing staggers yokai too
[2:54:18] <GilliamYaeger> It does own!
[2:54:21] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> it does
[2:54:22] <twistedhands> it's real good
[2:54:24] <%Tragosavich> The Yokai abiilities get crazy later on
[2:54:35] <amiavamp> Only problem is enemies can iframe through it
[2:54:44] <GilliamYaeger> You just flat out get one of the best and simplest Yokai abilities right at the start of the game, it's amazing
[2:54:46] <Huntercd> Pony yokai plagueTaps plagueHarkness
[2:54:50] <+aWanderingKaivo> Otakemaru's yokai ability is nuts
[2:54:51] <Kghaleon> Low stance uses little stamina/ki and lets you dodge faster, it's useful to learn to switch to that on the fly
[2:54:54] <President_valentine> Kasha soulcore is really good
[2:54:54] <shiny_prinny> doin it big
[2:54:55] <GunneryGoblin> literally as i sit here, wanting to go back to my own nioh save, im still indecisive about weapon choice
[2:55:08] <%shurtal> that feeling when you get 7 comms cause you solo'd the boss after everyone else wiped
[2:55:10] <%Blank9> do all weapons, duh
[2:55:12] <Hamborgini> spooky hellwoods
[2:55:18] <%RayReborne> PURPLE
[2:55:25] <%athuramn> fist weapons are amazing
[2:55:29] <Zombrocom> Fists and odaichis are good choices. Although, not like there is a bad choice.
[2:55:38] <%Tragosavich> Fist has fun combos
[2:55:41] <%PatchTheSquid> @GunneryGoblin Respec is easy, and its easy to grind others up. try them all.
[2:55:43] <%Paperware> Spear is also fantastic
[2:55:44] <%abrupt_abe> psaDogchamp psaGiefrail
[2:55:45] <+sonofrobin73> OH he's british in the english version?!?!
[2:55:45] <GunneryGoblin> i think im leaning fists/kusurigama for my save
[2:55:50] <@GeneralSCPatton> Sub missions are always a walled off fraction of a normal map, or like this forest with modular obstacles.
[2:55:51] <President_valentine> I was a fist and dual sword boy
[2:55:57] <RumonGray> just MUGGING these men
[2:55:58] <%Blank9> closest to a bad weapon is twin hatchets, but even they're usable
[2:56:00] <%vivaldiva> "some AMAZING treasure in that there pit, i mean village"
[2:56:02] <%Tragosavich> If you go to low stance in fists you can do nutty stuff
[2:56:10] <captainnathaniel> everyone is british in the english version
[2:56:10] <cartakus> Fist and axes for me
[2:56:11] <+HefestoForges> Pat there's a fun fact about Hiddy
[2:56:14] <%abrupt_abe> Battle arena sub missions are the best
[2:56:17] <+aWanderingKaivo> My first full run was mostly dual swords, they are pretty simple but effective
[2:56:21] <Huntercd> @patstaresat Why is everyone British?
[2:56:22] <%pokefan9956> dangit pat. I have so many other games to play. now I wanna play nioh 2
[2:56:23] <amiavamp> hatchets make up for their badness with strong ranged attacks, they're useful as a secondary weapon
[2:56:31] <+aWanderingKaivo> the basic ass katana has some really cool moves tbh
[2:56:33] <%PatchTheSquid> Switch Glaive/Hatchets have been a blast.
[2:56:35] <%Dakuu75> wtf was that flip lol
[2:56:38] <+sonofrobin73> @captainnathaniel That's really weird. I played the whole game in japanese, didn't know
[2:56:39] <ferbeholds> nice
[2:56:54] <%PMAvers> You punched out all that man's blood.
[2:56:55] <Zombrocom> Basic ass katana has the two coolest moves in the game, izuna drop and Judgment Cut End
[2:57:00] <+haitakaa> crazy talk activate
[2:57:03] <@GeneralSCPatton> I'm glad you're really enjoying this
[2:57:07] <+pectusumbra> god, I so want a biome like this for an Etrian Odyssey game
[2:57:15] <%Tragosavich> @captainnathaniel I didnt know either there was a dub
[2:57:28] <BettyMwwaahh> @zombrocom fists also have the izuna drop
[2:57:28] <TheMadBadger> @Zombrocom Fist also has Izuna drop. And you can bully bosses so much easier
[2:57:30] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Zombrocom both of those are skill drops right? I have a save I need to get back to to try and get them
[2:57:30] <@GeneralSCPatton> Yes, this forest gets reused with different branch walls
[2:57:31] <+rafaelba93> some levels are remixable
[2:57:33] <cartakus> They mix and match side missions
[2:57:34] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Is there a Kappa in this game?
[2:57:34] <%abrupt_abe> All those red phantoms, so much loot to grab
[2:57:38] <artoflec> yeah that was new for Nioh 2
[2:57:41] <Hamborgini> the english dub was the default on PS4 iirc
[2:57:43] <%Vextalyst> @PatStaresAt For fist you want to get battering ram asap it's great
[2:57:44] <cartakus> Fuck this dub to hell
[2:57:45] <%CatastropheCorvid> I sure am
[2:57:47] <AppleJinx> judging from the quality of the dub there might as well not be
[2:57:48] <TranquiloArman> My game defaulted to dub for some reason
[2:57:48] <LVL1_Scumbag> You ARE crazy, but that's not a crazy thing to assume
[2:57:50] <Latija> the absolute size of this dub
[2:57:52] <+Jack8274> i love it
[2:58:00] <sonicblade38> i had zero clue there was a dub
[2:58:01] <%PMAvers> Frogman splash off the top ropes!
[2:58:04] <President_valentine> @nigelschnauzerpug Yes. he shoves his fingers up your ass
[2:58:14] <%SuckerPunchSyd> NICE
[2:58:19] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> we knew about dub just not the British
[2:58:20] <%athuramn> do most of the fist hits still stunlock in light stance?
[2:58:27] <+Jack8274> Just wait until you get the crazy moves later one
[2:58:27] <Zombrocom> I know fists has an izuna drop too LUL I am just sayin, for being the basic bitch weapon, katana gets to do some super sick moves
[2:58:27] <+Orcapugs> I’m almost finished and I just learned about the dub
[2:58:30] <+theomnisoup> They're the dlc weapons of this game
[2:58:33] <%Vextalyst> i get that
[2:58:33] <cartakus> Wha
[2:58:40] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Playing Nioh 2 actually helps alot in playing Nioh 1
[2:58:43] <didgereedoodah> bruh what
[2:58:47] <@Ranryu692> ligma
[2:58:47] <+Local16> I totally get that
[2:58:48] <Profmcstevie> Iron Fist versus Iron Blade
[2:58:50] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @President_valentine Why did it automatically do that to me? I can say Kappa without refering to the actual mythology? I'm not mad, but I'm extremely mad.
[2:58:54] <+aWanderingKaivo> uh
[2:58:54] <ferbeholds> its fist passive
[2:58:56] <amiavamp> You get a stack buff when you use Active Skills as combo enders
[2:58:56] <shiny_prinny> you're getting stacks, it's an ability in your tree
[2:58:57] <Hamborgini> fist weapon mechanic: powers up attack I think
[2:58:58] <cartakus> Combo skill damage up
[2:58:59] <%RayReborne> move that beefs you up when using skills after another
[2:59:00] <Zombrocom> On that's the Fists passive ability
[2:59:00] <%zeroarturia> English Heihachi just... didn't felt right
[2:59:02] <TheeRabbi> Xeno Chest Burster. Duh
[2:59:02] <amiavamp> for fist
[2:59:03] <+Axellogic> oh the fist skill
[2:59:04] <Hamborgini> when you chain skills
[2:59:05] <+McSoliace> its the fists sub system
[2:59:06] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt Fists get a damage boost for doing consecutive hits
[2:59:07] <mr_catsup> Fists reward you for style basically
[2:59:08] <+Smokebanshee> mechanic for fist weapons
[2:59:08] <%Vextalyst> It's a sort of cancel
[2:59:09] <cricket42069> yeah that's def the ligma
[2:59:09] <didgereedoodah> building stacks
[2:59:11] <andrei1h1> because you chain actives with fists
[2:59:15] <+Axellogic> when you link active skills you get stronger
[2:59:15] <+haitakaa> like your face when you laugh?
[2:59:16] <%athuramn> higher combo counts increase damage
[2:59:18] <+HefestoForges> OOF
[2:59:19] <%Tragosavich> You have to combo skills
[2:59:19] <mr_catsup> damage buff changing up moves
[2:59:21] <+aWanderingKaivo> got em
[2:59:22] <%Tragosavich> to get a buff
[2:59:23] <+Smokebanshee> It's in your skill tree
[2:59:24] <Zombrocom> You can cancel skills into other moves, which grants you a stacking buff as you do it
[2:59:25] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat unbroken buff
[2:59:26] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[2:59:35] <TheeRabbi> If you did that, you would nearly die
[2:59:35] <+McSoliace> bigger combo more  damage
[2:59:36] <%RayReborne> ALL KODURMUR GET
[2:59:36] <%Blank9> each different ability you use in the same combo string gives you a stack of damage up
[2:59:37] <%PatchTheSquid> Style Buff
[2:59:40] <@GeneralSCPatton> Oh, right. I think fist stacks an attack buff for every different move in your combo
[2:59:42] <+pectusumbra> there was another chest?
[2:59:44] <olm46> Average spear enjoyer
[2:59:46] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Knocking that guy off the ledge reminds me of that samurai guy in DS3 that fell off the cliff when you ran away
[2:59:48] <%Visorak6> being in a warrior culture falling to death in battle must be pretty humiliating
[2:59:49] <%notsoy> DO COMBO
[2:59:55] <+HefestoForges> oh that's later
[2:59:56] <Zombrocom> On, you get it when you unlock the blacksmith
[2:59:58] <+aWanderingKaivo> a mission will unlock the blacksmith soon, you do it there
[2:59:58] <%Vextalyst> it's really inexpensive
[2:59:59] <President_valentine> need to unlock the blacksmith
[2:59:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> I don't think you have it unlocked
[3:00:00] <amiavamp> You unlock it with the blacksmith, won't be long
[3:00:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah, you gotta unlock the smith for it
[3:00:01] <sonicblade38> @PatStaresAt u do it at blacksmith girl
[3:00:02] <Ferakin> The glamour is an option at the blacksmith
[3:00:03] <+cheerfulnpc> It gets unlocked when you get the blacksmith
[3:00:03] <cartakus> Just go to smith and waste money lol
[3:00:05] <+Jack8274> Oh it's super easy, it costs money and you can do everything you have unlocked
[3:00:05] <+charp35> You just go to the blacksmith
[3:00:07] <sirrice77> i'm actually ass at using the fists because i don't use the chaining at all
[3:00:08] <CaptainKarite> A lot comes with story progression
[3:00:09] <cricket42069> it's one mission later i believe
[3:00:09] <soflicar> I think after 3rd mission
[3:00:09] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @wizard_of_diamonds One of the best moments in that LP
[3:00:10] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Wait till later in the game before u worry about that or you will be doing it after every mission
[3:00:11] <%zeroarturia> That is later with the blacksmith
[3:00:13] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[3:00:13] <+aWanderingKaivo> damn
[3:00:15] <DXLelouch24> Transmog
[3:00:15] <koffeemancer> just keep doing main story itll unlock soon
[3:00:18] <GunneryGoblin> god the fists are NASTY
[3:00:20] <%RayReborne> matching to a full set works, some of this armor looks sick
[3:00:20] <+Jack8274> That is your bread and butter honestly
[3:00:21] <%Puhff> so he looks just like you psaDab
[3:00:21] <Zombrocom> Yeah fists are pretty cool
[3:00:25] <Hamborgini> that move is really good with elemental and status effects
[3:00:25] <%athuramn> fists are broken because they hit stun most anything
[3:00:25] <DXLelouch24> Blacksmith later
[3:00:27] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> thats after next main mission
[3:00:27] <+Jack8274> I used that move the whole game
[3:00:28] <%Vextalyst> @PatStaresAt did you know you can have the helmets not show up?
[3:00:30] <%Blank9> the trick with chaining fist weapons is just spam stomps and battering rams
[3:00:35] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @wizard_of_diamonds It will never not be funny lmao
[3:00:36] <+cheerfulnpc> @Bluwizard21 It's worth it.  I will suffer for my fashion.
[3:00:48] <cartakus> Alright them, good night everyone. Enjoy yourself pat
[3:00:49] <President_valentine> Everything is weeb here
[3:01:00] <%Vextalyst> ah ok
[3:01:02] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Who doesn't want to wear their helmet?
[3:01:03] <didgereedoodah> weeb demon
[3:01:06] <GunneryGoblin> everything is weeb so long as Pat's character is involved
[3:01:09] <+wizard_of_diamonds> We're all weebs here
[3:01:11] <%Savarro> Once I used the fists once I was like "Oh yeah these are getting a full playthrough"
[3:01:13] <Profmcstevie> We're inventing weeb
[3:01:15] <%MidnightBurst12> Set to W for Weeb
[3:01:18] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Even that one guy who said he wasn't a weeb
[3:01:23] <+wizard_of_diamonds> He's a SUPER weeb
[3:01:29] <%Vextalyst> it's usually the first thing i do in any game that lets me is disable helmets lol
[3:01:29] <%RayReborne> @nigelschnauzerpug When you have big anime Hair
[3:01:31] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Bluwizard21 its also cheap so its not like its a huge hassle
[3:01:32] <Zombrocom> Desperation attack
[3:01:35] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat look at fist skill tree and find Beyond Infinity, THAT is the skill you want the most.Once you master the timing you delete stuff
[3:01:36] <%athuramn> COUNTER their red shit
[3:01:37] <%daemonazaezal> suicide charge
[3:01:38] <+rafaelba93> that KILLS YOU
[3:01:40] <shiny_prinny> when they get low, yeah
[3:01:41] <amiavamp> Even the basic human jobbers can do that, don't wanna get hit by that
[3:01:41] <+pectusumbra> possessed? turning into a yokai
[3:01:43] <%toolofparanoia> Activate blood mode
[3:01:46] <twistedhands> DESPERATION SUPER
[3:01:48] <ferbeholds> those are nasty
[3:01:52] <President_valentine> fuck the ninjas command grab
[3:01:54] <+cheerfulnpc> Yeah, human enemies will do suicide moves after recovering from stamina break and near death
[3:02:00] <artoflec> look at this 2Kat weeb
[3:02:03] <Profmcstevie> BURN YOUR SOUL FOR EXTRA DAMAGE
[3:02:05] <odnucaf3> Human enemies can grab too.
[3:02:07] <TerrifyingRei_05> fucking sick
[3:02:10] <%Dakuu75> jesus christ
[3:02:10] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:02:12] <%notsoy> LOL damn
[3:02:13] <+aWanderingKaivo> ok that looked wrong
[3:02:13] <%athuramn> too early
[3:02:13] <+wizard_of_diamonds> BRUH
[3:02:15] <%RayReborne> big grab
[3:02:15] <amiavamp> yeah they kind of fucking suck to deal with lol
[3:02:15] <+rafaelba93> told ya
[3:02:16] <RumonGray> Yeah it's a tough counter
[3:02:16] <cricket42069> typical dual sword user lol
[3:02:17] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Get fucked
[3:02:17] <+McSoliace> command grab
[3:02:17] <%Issun135> p a i n
[3:02:18] <%RayReborne> lol
[3:02:18] <shiny_prinny> yeah that's a grab
[3:02:18] <andrei1h1> bad timing
[3:02:18] <%Tragosavich> Last stand move
[3:02:18] <+GojiraKira> holy-
[3:02:19] <%crot454> get styled on
[3:02:20] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[3:02:21] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I'm with you on that, that was foul
[3:02:22] <%CalderGaming> psaWhat
[3:02:22] <+Daoshinto> got grabbed.
[3:02:22] <Zombrocom> He got ya with the ultra comboi
[3:02:25] <+greeam> thats the weakness of the brute counter
[3:02:25] <%Puhff> LUL
[3:02:26] <Zombrocom> No, that was too late
[3:02:27] <Hamborgini> feral dodge is easier for the grab moves
[3:02:27] <+cheerfulnpc> They do that when they're almost dead and you don't finish them quickly enough
[3:02:29] <TheeRabbi> He mounted your ass
[3:02:30] <%RayReborne> no too late/ close
[3:02:30] <ferbeholds> too late thats brute counter for you
[3:02:32] <%Vextalyst> ONE GUY that was not too early
[3:02:37] <artoflec> ive never understood how those work, because they red flash AND grab flash
[3:02:37] <shiny_prinny> no that was too late for sure
[3:02:38] <mr_catsup> Brute isn't good against grabs
[3:02:38] <didgereedoodah> no that was late
[3:02:41] <DXLelouch24> Command grab
[3:02:42] <soflicar> no for brute that was late
[3:02:42] <maddogshimano> ACTING LIKE YOU WONT GET COMMANED GRABBED
[3:02:44] <+charp35> The brute counter has a startup, the others are instant
[3:02:45] <+aWanderingKaivo> some things can't be brute countered maybe that's one? dunno
[3:02:46] <TerrifyingRei_05> too earte
[3:02:50] <%athuramn> what @ferbeholds said, brute counter is hardest
[3:02:50] <amiavamp> If you use a yokai skill that transforms you (both of the equipped ones right now), you are invulnerable to grabs
[3:02:52] <mr_catsup> cause you trade a lot with it and grabs are never in your favor
[3:02:52] <Zombrocom> Brute counter is an interupt, you need to do it super early
[3:02:53] <%RayReborne> the Feral Dodge is good against grabs
[3:02:54] <+Axellogic> Welcome to brute counter's weakness, grab attacks. Because brute is the slowest one its bad against grabs
[3:02:58] <%Blank9> yeah brute's best for throwing out almost predictive, and worst comes to worst you slapped them
[3:03:01] <didgereedoodah> you have to do brute very early
[3:03:03] <Ferakin> Brute sucks against grabs as a caveat for working against everything else
[3:03:03] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[3:03:05] <%Savarro> Feral tears up command grab counters
[3:03:06] <%Dakuu75> those weapons are nuts
[3:03:11] <%crot454> i like the feral since its just a dash
[3:03:15] <cricket42069> lol that combo is gross
[3:03:16] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat thats a command grab, brute sucks for that
[3:03:20] <%Dakuu75> fatality on the go
[3:03:21] <%CalderGaming> i mean you are part oni or something
[3:03:25] <%RyTYoung> RAW
[3:03:28] <%Blank9> heavy high stance combos do big damage/stun
[3:03:32] <%Visorak6> But is it RAAAWWWW
[3:03:33] <@GeneralSCPatton> Try the high stance backstep into heavy
[3:03:34] <%Vextalyst> Wait till you get Battering Ram it's busted against humans
[3:03:38] <+rafaelba93> keep hitting them as they fall to cut more members off
[3:03:39] <Zombrocom> Basically, Brute = Interupt, Feral = Doge, Phantom = parry
[3:03:42] <vandastelka> i mean it makes sense you are big strength
[3:03:43] <andrei1h1> ki pulse more pat
[3:03:46] <amiavamp> really encourages focusing down human enemies so they don't do that bs
[3:03:47] <TheeRabbi> I mean... It is canonically set in the Ninja Gaiden universe, so it makes sense.
[3:03:48] <+aWanderingKaivo> you punched BOTH of his arms off
[3:03:48] <%epide> lol well you are a half demon in this one
[3:03:49] <cricket42069> raw like les oignons
[3:03:56] <Zombrocom> Oh god battering ram is the best
[3:03:59] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat your half Yokai, your basically red headed balding Dante
[3:04:08] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Executed
[3:04:11] <%Tragosavich> I always like low stance on fists just cause of the low stamina and combo extensions
[3:04:15] <%epide> @DXLelouch24 YUP
[3:04:24] <+kewlmyc> LUL
[3:04:25] <+rafaelba93> weeb dante
[3:04:29] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> boss
[3:04:33] <+aWanderingKaivo> DODGED
[3:04:34] <%Djinnazz> whiff
[3:04:35] <Zombrocom> Yo that dude has moves
[3:04:36] <+HefestoForges> WHIFF
[3:04:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[3:04:37] <Qliphoth_Rhizome> wack inuyasha
[3:04:38] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> What is Japan's equivalent to Pizza?
[3:04:39] <%MidnightBurst12> whiff
[3:04:39] <scrumbotime> You should adjust your yokai form so it doesn't have that big head of hair
[3:04:40] <+pectusumbra> Hey, any description that includes being Dante in it ain't bad
[3:04:41] <+cheerfulnpc> In other words, Dante's final form to achieve true don't give a shittitude
[3:04:41] <artoflec> that was whack
[3:04:42] <shiny_prinny> that dodge
[3:04:43] <%athuramn> @tragosavich low stance is where it's at but takes a few skill points to get goin in
[3:04:47] <twistedhands> yo he dodged it
[3:04:48] <Zombrocom> THat man I FRAMED you
[3:04:51] <Hamborgini> hard read
[3:04:54] <%MidnightBurst12> lame af
[3:04:55] <+HefestoForges> like I said before pat it's better to combo those
[3:04:57] <%Archmortal> the game knows how to show disrespect
[3:05:00] <nobunaga1221> this game has so many cool mechanics
[3:05:02] <BettyMwwaahh> that move looks real dumb
[3:05:02] <%epide> LOL how does it feel to be at 45% devil time
[3:05:04] <%MidnightBurst12> kat
[3:05:05] <scrumbotime> mow mow mow
[3:05:08] <Huntercd> plagueTaps bitterClap plagueHarkness
[3:05:08] <amiavamp> dodging is absolute nonsense in this game, there are tons of big horizontals you have to iframe through
[3:05:08] <%athuramn> money cat
[3:05:10] <sirrice77> @NigelSchnauzerpug japan has pizza, just with weird toppings. Unless you meant feudal japan
[3:05:11] <%CalderGaming> psaGib
[3:05:11] <penitentpendant> Six stacks of PET
[3:05:12] <TerrifyingRei_05> CORB
[3:05:18] <%abrupt_abe> Kitty cat equals big  Anima regen
[3:05:22] <%Puhff> wtf
[3:05:23] <%MidnightPacif1c> psaGib
[3:05:24] <%epide> LUCK CAT
[3:05:26] <%Broand> Rollmo
[3:05:28] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt if you read the kitty lore in the hut its kinda sad
[3:05:30] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> think of it like a combo finisher
[3:05:37] <%MidnightBurst12> he attack
[3:05:37] <TheMadBadger> @athuramn Nah, you want high stance fists. High stance and you just Heavy, Light combo. You bully people so easily and build up your passive so fast.
[3:05:44] <%SaiyanShoto> I remember I got really over leveled in this game cause I did a lot of co op missions online LUL
[3:05:48] <amiavamp> it's really good for taking out groups of small yokai
[3:05:55] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @NigelSchnauzerpug Well is Pat's character is Japanese Dante, I was just trying to figure out what he likes to eat. So it could still just be pizza, but with weird toppings.
[3:05:55] <GeoGio3> what the cat doin?
[3:06:06] <scrumbotime> I absolutely love how nearly every demon in this game has those fucked up crystals
[3:06:16] <%CalderGaming> @NigelSchnauzerpug okonomiyaki
[3:06:18] <TheMadBadger> @GeoGio3 He recharges out anima
[3:06:23] <%Tragosavich> Cat gives regen to purple bar
[3:06:32] <artoflec> the cat also BOPS the enemy
[3:06:39] <GeoGio3> nice, he cute
[3:06:45] <+aWanderingKaivo> cat also rolls into enemies and does ki damage, more to yokai, so usually they are close to dark realm areas
[3:06:48] <%Tragosavich> Cat cool
[3:06:50] <Zombrocom> I like how they have the video be ippon LUL
[3:06:51] <+rafaelba93> the flame besides your souls glows yellow when you can lvl up
[3:06:54] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @NigelSchnauzerpug I just looked that up. That's seems like what Japanese Dante would eat.
[3:06:57] <scrumbotime> who the hell knows
[3:06:58] <shiny_prinny> weird tutorial timing
[3:07:00] <andrei1h1> don't forget that the shrine shows up on the minimap
[3:07:05] <RumonGray> and when you go into the dark world, the kitty gets all spiky
[3:07:15] <cricket42069> L
[3:07:20] <+rafaelba93> 95% hiy lol
[3:07:21] <%Puhff> KEKW
[3:07:25] <TheeRabbi> 2/2
[3:07:32] <%Blank9> you can hold sprint while still locked onto enemies
[3:07:36] <%Blank9> and run 360 degrees
[3:07:41] <@GeneralSCPatton> R3 to zoom
[3:07:53] <BettyMwwaahh> belly flop!
[3:07:55] <+Ell1ot> nailed it
[3:08:09] <scrumbotime> this game is surprisingly  easy to naturally go between ranged and melee
[3:08:17] <soflicar> I've never noticed the heart beat til now
[3:08:19] <cricket42069> nt nt nt
[3:08:38] <primaryfire> it's not that different in loot amount
[3:08:42] <artoflec> it benefits you better to just trade all the trash anyway, you never really deal with it
[3:08:42] <%kknutson4> i didn't know this game had fist weapons.  are they really good?
[3:08:44] <%CatastropheCorvid> Lots o Loops
[3:08:46] <%athuramn> LeVeL DeSiGn
[3:08:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah this forest is a bit confusing
[3:08:51] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> think of it as money
[3:08:52] <%greasypete00> what are the blue bloodstain things
[3:08:52] <+Ell1ot> loops
[3:08:53] <amiavamp> fists are OP
[3:08:54] <%CatastropheCorvid> @kknutson4 They're amazing
[3:08:55] <scrumbotime> did that motherfucker just actually naruto run
[3:08:58] <@GeneralSCPatton> Perhaps start paying attention to gear quality on red phantoms and go for some purples
[3:09:00] <TheMadBadger> @kknutson4 Very good and very fun
[3:09:04] <%CatastropheCorvid> @greasypete00 Friendly summons

[3:10:51] <%Logoth_> Mishion Comprete
[3:10:52] <agustorm123> This game looks piss easy
[3:10:53] <%Blank9> your yokai soul skills recharge super fast in the dark zone, to make up for bad ki recovery
[3:11:00] <Parapattern> Mmm...Monke
[3:11:00] <TheMadBadger> You ooked him in the dooker D:
[3:11:03] <Mister_McDerp> ez

[3:11:12] <+aWanderingKaivo> mission done
[3:11:17] <+HefestoForges> it was just another way in
[3:11:18] <%RayReborne> @agustorm123 fists make it real easy yeah
[3:11:20] <cricket42069> it's nothing lol
[3:11:21] <Parapattern> You gotta leave
[3:11:23] <Hamborgini> you are not allow
[3:11:23] <%RayReborne> a little
[3:11:28] <@GeneralSCPatton> Those walls just block off parts of the map that aren't used in this sub mission
[3:11:28] <+Sendrak70> Its the NO zone.
[3:11:30] <%YakumoYomi> Mission's done. No exploring for you
[3:11:31] <%holydeviant1> That land is so evil it's DRAWN, not rendered
[3:11:36] <soflicar> this level will be reused
[3:11:37] <sirrice77> @agustorm123 It's not. Pat is just do very well. Most people are really bad at fighting that monkey
[3:11:43] <amiavamp> Now you can combine monkes to get upgraded monke
[3:11:52] <rReizs> just like monster hunter, some parts of the zone are blocked for different missions
[3:11:53] <+rafaelba93> snake boss will be fun Kappa Kappa
[3:11:55] <stormhawk9891> Better Monke
[3:12:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yep
[3:12:02] <TsunTsuchinoko> different stats
[3:12:02] <%Blank9> higher level
[3:12:02] <+HefestoForges> yes
[3:12:04] <Hamborgini> combine soul cores to make them better
[3:12:05] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[3:12:06] <andrei1h1> you can fuse duplicates
[3:12:06] <ferbeholds> yeah plus attunement cost -1 is good
[3:12:08] <TheeRabbi> Spirit Stones and Incest. My favorite
[3:12:09] <+pectusumbra> yes
[3:12:11] <shiny_prinny> yes, and you can fuse the small one into the big one
[3:12:15] <@GeneralSCPatton> You can fuse them to make even better
[3:12:19] <+Jack8274> You can feed monkey to the other monkey to get stronger
[3:12:24] <stormhawk9891> Shrine
[3:12:24] <%abrupt_abe> Fuuuusion
[3:12:25] <+Axellogic> in shrine
[3:12:26] <%RayReborne> different buffs but yeah. you can fuse the same cores to buff
[3:12:29] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> LeRouch_the_Rebel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Here's wishing everyone in chat a happy holiday time! I hope Charles Darwin evolves down your chimney on Sciencemas eve and leves tons of theories under your bookshelf.
[3:12:29] <+SilverDevilfish> You can now feed old Monke stone to new Monke stone
[3:12:38] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> fuse
[3:12:46] <%MidnightPacif1c> demon fusion goblins PogChamp
[3:12:52] <+Axellogic> The passives on the skill increase as you level the core
[3:12:52] <amiavamp> It bumps up the soul core rank
[3:12:56] <+HefestoForges> almost nothing lol
[3:13:08] <olm46> Superior monke
[3:13:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> penultimate monke achieved
[3:13:17] <Hamborgini> plus 0.1% damage against humans fuck yeah
[3:13:22] <Ferakin> Soul cores can also inherit abilities this way, once you find cores with inheritables
[3:13:22] <+Axellogic> Soul core rank can be stacked to throw in any new cores as you get them
[3:13:25] <%athuramn> those fusions have more merit later on
[3:13:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I think you get the blacksmith in the next mission
[3:13:28] <%RayReborne> Passives get stronger as the soul level goes up. not that much different for low levek cores tho
[3:13:29] <Foopoof> Monke make monke stronk
[3:13:30] <%Futurecity10> How is he doing mind goblin wise? Cause I want to tell him something about the game and dont want to crash his brain
[3:13:31] <amiavamp> a lot of the passives are pretty silly yeah lol
[3:13:42] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt and now u get the blacksmith
[3:13:44] <%Blank9> yeah I just kept fusing into higher levels later on, it carried all them over
[3:13:47] <+Jack8274> Brace yourself
[3:13:50] <rReizs> blacksmithing is just delete EVERYTHING that isnt purple and then make all the materials you get purple
[3:13:51] <DXLelouch24> Oh boy
[3:13:54] <total_overkill> @Futurecity10 hes handling it better then expected... for now
[3:13:55] <DXLelouch24> This boss
[3:13:56] <+Jack8274> This level is long af
[3:13:57] <agustorm123> Doggo is the real alpha
[3:14:01] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> psaGiefrail
[3:14:01] <%athuramn> @futurecity10 lol what did you want to tell him?
[3:14:09] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Futurecity10 the mind goblin is skipping nioh 1 so doing pretty well
[3:14:10] <TheMadBadger> @Futurecity10 doing pretty good. But if you're gonna tell him about something he doesn't need to worry about at this level, i'd suggest not
[3:14:11] <+Axellogic> GIVE ME MEAT
[3:14:12] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @Futurecity10 He's being admitted to a psychiatric hospital shortly. The mind goblins won.
[3:14:14] <Zombrocom> It's a good snake
[3:14:14] <%MidnightPacif1c> psaGiefrail
[3:14:18] <%Futurecity10> About how ewapon proficincy is limited
[3:14:19] <TheeRabbi> Snek
[3:14:39] <+RobertWayneLewis98> Haha I am eeeveeel
[3:14:44] <President_valentine> You're bro is an ass kisser
[3:14:48] <primaryfire> that shit is getting burnt dude
[3:14:48] <+bloodrune8864> Oh man the dub
[3:14:54] <%greasypete00> monkey man haha
[3:14:54] <+Jack8274> He is NOT meant to sound like a villain btw
[3:14:54] <BettyMwwaahh> this dub is kinda weird. maybe just because I already played the game twice in Japanese
[3:15:00] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat this is your first Wall Pat,The boss doesnt play
[3:15:01] <TheeRabbi> They call me.... Bettty. Myeeeaahhhh
[3:15:05] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> pat start using Talismans so you can unlock omyou skills
[3:15:06] <agustorm123> Ohh nice beard
[3:15:12] <+Axellogic> FEED MEAT
[3:15:13] <%MidnightBurst12> tom cruise?
[3:15:14] <akitanito> is it human meat
[3:15:15] <primaryfire> he doesn't sound like a villain at all in jpn lol
[3:15:17] <%Broand> yo that meat looks tasty
[3:15:18] <+aWanderingKaivo> @BettyMwwaahh the voices really do not match the personalities imo
[3:15:25] <+cheerfulnpc> This dub is pretty rough.
[3:15:27] <President_valentine> nah the next boss is the wall
[3:15:27] <%Djinnazz> oh boy, this place
[3:15:27] <%athuramn> oh, I wouldn't worry about that, maybe in a few hours when he goes deeper into the weapon mechanics @futurecity10
[3:15:29] <Zombrocom> They do some odd things with the dub to try and get it to line up with the japanese lip syncing
[3:15:30] <%IncredibleMeh> why did they give him a weird evil voice that's so bizare
[3:15:37] <captainnathaniel> this is some Yakuza level of silliness
[3:15:37] <sirrice77> No the dub is a little weird but it may grow on you the way xenoblade's might
[3:15:38] <+R_BChe> mt tataru monkaS
[3:15:42] <+aWanderingKaivo> tokichiro is supposed to sound all bumbling
[3:15:50] <%DashXero> DashXero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Huh. 14 months. Enjoying the stream. Keep up the good work, Pat. Also... Have you tried The Good Life yet? It's a Swery game that you might enjoy.
[3:16:04] <DXLelouch24> @president_valentine both this boss and snake are walls
[3:16:08] <artoflec> its daytime, which you dont see a lot in these games lol
[3:16:08] <Kghaleon> useful to start investing in water magic
[3:16:20] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[3:16:26] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[3:16:29] <+cheerfulnpc> The inclusion of daytime missions was one of my favorite additions to Nioh 2.  Nice to not have to always be in the dark.
[3:16:35] <Mister_McDerp> BORK
[3:16:47] <artoflec> it has a couple but its really like 2 or 3
[3:16:48] <+Axellogic> It had a few
[3:16:49] <amiavamp> It did
[3:16:49] <TheMadBadger> It did
[3:16:50] <%Djinnazz> it did
[3:16:51] <shiny_prinny> it had very few
[3:16:51] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt from zero to Yakuza, how silly is the humor in this?
[3:16:53] <Zombrocom> Uh
[3:16:53] <%RyTYoung> No it did
[3:16:54] <%Broand> it had a couple
[3:16:54] <%tauntauntaunt> It definitely did
[3:16:55] <efratzy> dlc had a few
[3:16:56] <%DianaTheAscian> it did
[3:16:56] <%Tragosavich> It does in the DLC i remember
[3:16:57] <%tauntauntaunt> near the start
[3:16:57] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> very few
[3:16:58] <%athuramn> I'm pretty sure it had a few
[3:16:58] <Zombrocom> The DLC did
[3:17:00] <total_overkill> most of the dlc?
[3:17:00] <Zombrocom> I remember
[3:17:00] <+McSoliace> barely
[3:17:00] <twistedhands> very few
[3:17:00] <+cheerfulnpc> In the DLC it did, but not in the base game.
[3:17:06] <@GeneralSCPatton> This mission has the first ninja and mage locks, so you can start grinding tons of skill points after those first unlocks
[3:17:08] <+cheerfulnpc> It had night and twilight missions.
[3:17:10] <%greasypete00> there was the shrine thing in the desert-y valley type of place
[3:17:10] <TsunTsuchinoko> it had some, like the outside grassy ones
[3:17:13] <amiavamp> @captainnathaniel humor in this is like a 2/10, it's very serious
[3:17:13] <+rafaelba93> the flame besides your souls gets yellow when you can lvl up
[3:17:14] <%DashXero> What are entries in this game? I played a hundred hours of it, and I don't recall what they are.
[3:17:17] <%RealThiele> lighting is hard
[3:17:18] <stormhawk9891> Cause DLC
[3:17:20] <%Broand> It had that mission in the mountain desert thing
[3:17:21] <%slrls_> chads with fists don't die, obviously
[3:17:21] <%tauntauntaunt> The base game like the second level is in the mines
[3:17:22] <%kknutson4> Because they're cowards
[3:17:23] <%tauntauntaunt> and it's in the day time
[3:17:25] <akitanito> desire sensor is real
[3:17:26] <%greasypete00> and i think the caves had a daytime one
[3:17:26] <%Futurecity10> cheer500 Sup Pat, Just donating to celebrate my first and only amv reaching 50k views in only 3 months.  Its the only thing I ever sat down and made and it turned out extremely well and not cringe.
[3:17:27] <+Axellogic> People love switchglaive
[3:17:28] <%athuramn> because people are lame
[3:17:28] <%RayReborne> Dlc weapon pat lol
[3:17:33] <jorniev> because youre the main character
[3:17:56] <VincentBrouillons> spears are also quite a lot of fun in this one
[3:17:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> almost had em
[3:17:58] <%athuramn> fists take a lot of skill to get good with but if you do, it's one of the best weapons
[3:17:58] <+Axellogic> Oh yeah is Pat playing on PS or PC
[3:17:59] <Hamborgini> you got some good hits in though
[3:17:59] <%DashXero> Fists are kinda .... Eehhh.... There are quicker ways to kill stuff than fists in the early game.
[3:18:01] <amiavamp> Switchglaive is rough to fight in mid or low stance, very little startup on moves
[3:18:04] <VincentBrouillons> lots of spiny shit on low
[3:18:08] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Everyone has the DLC on pc guys
[3:18:08] <%RayReborne> the DLC has enemies using the new weapons(fists and splitstaff)
[3:18:12] <Hamborgini> you almost killed em
[3:18:13] <+aWanderingKaivo> almost killed him
[3:18:16] <+cheerfulnpc> Fun fact: the revenants adjust their play style to match their player's style.
[3:18:17] <%RayReborne> but not base game
[3:18:18] <$SGrim> @Futurecity10 What is the name of your AMV
[3:18:22] <%NopeBadguy> he got more good hits in than you
[3:18:23] <%captain_thickthighs> crap did I miss Pat reading my message That's a keeping instance Open for a clan mate
[3:18:25] <%YakumoYomi> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:18:27] <Ferakin> Fists are good when you have all their combo skills and want to delete ki
[3:18:31] <CeJaxon> i really enjoyed using the bo staff in this game
[3:18:33] <%Savarro> Scythe and Kusarigama phantoms are the most annoying to deal with
[3:18:33] <Huntercd> Fundoshi zoneGasm plagueHarkness
[3:18:33] <+Nomenanza> oh man this level
[3:18:35] <Ferakin> In sheer damage, there's better weapons
[3:18:44] <%athuramn> I'm pretty sure fists are not dlc, they're just new to nioh 2 in general
[3:18:52] <+Nomenanza> The boss of this level felt seriously unfair
[3:18:54] <Kghaleon> it's like FFXIV, you got mob groups that all aggro at once
[3:18:57] <amiavamp> They're dlc
[3:18:58] <+bloodrune8864> No they’re dlc
[3:19:07] <%PatchTheSquid> Fists and Split Staff were DLC
[3:19:09] <+aWanderingKaivo> @athuramn they were dlc but complete edition has all dlc so yeah
[3:19:12] <%YakumoYomi> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:19:13] <%Savarro> @athuramn they weren't in base Nioh 2
[3:19:16] <%Djinnazz> Nut?
[3:19:17] <akitanito> slimeee
[3:19:18] <+Larry_Q> doodoo slime boy!
[3:19:20] <%PatchTheSquid> Switch Glaive and Hatchets were new
[3:19:26] <+parrotman01> Holy smoke, these hands are rated E for everyone
[3:19:26] <+aWanderingKaivo> hatchets and switchglaive were the new weapons in the base game
[3:19:33] <+Axellogic> Fists were everyone when PC launched
[3:19:34] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> One day, Pat will avoid the goo
[3:19:42] <%athuramn> @savarro @awanderingkaivo ah ye, you're right, I had the complete edition
[3:19:58] <amiavamp> Shit's locked
[3:20:01] <%Djinnazz> and the spilt staff
[3:20:03] <%DashXero> Shit's locked.
[3:20:18] <Hamborgini> that man died pantsless
[3:20:18] <%notsoy> BOOM HEADSHOT
[3:20:43] <+Axellogic> Stomp is good in general
[3:20:59] <+Nomenanza> stomp allows for some sick cancels
[3:21:03] <%Dakuu75> GIEF, why you so SPICY~?!
[3:21:14] <DXLelouch24> Once you get Beyond Infinity and master the timing Ki ceases to exist
[3:21:31] <President_valentine> I wonder who he gets it from
[3:21:33] <+Axellogic> Limitless is fun but you are SO vulnerable
[3:21:36] <amiavamp> There's a bunch of skills that activate on ki pulse, they take some getting used to so you don't do them by accident
[3:21:38] <TheeRabbi> You look like someone who was LARPing and accindetally stepped into the time period
[3:21:41] <CeJaxon> hoping i can get my souls buds to try nioh 2 next it goes on sale. Always had alot of fun with this game
[3:21:48] <%skeletonmilk> hcjSickos hcjGun psaDogchamp
[3:22:22] <DXLelouch24> Because Beyond Infinity with perfect timing stunlocks the fuck outta enemies
[3:22:24] <Kghaleon> Nioh will spoil you, Elden ring will be a kids game compared to this difficulty
[3:22:45] <+Axellogic> got got
[3:22:46] <+Nomenanza> oh yeah they get those now too
[3:22:47] <ferbeholds> thats a dangerous alley
[3:22:51] <+aWanderingKaivo> I actually think I haven't seen that move
[3:22:52] <@GeneralSCPatton> Helmets block arrows but not bullets or cannon rounds
[3:22:53] <TheeRabbi> lmao
[3:22:57] <%Puhff> LUL
[3:23:00] <GunneryGoblin> honestly, that dude earned that kill on ya
[3:23:06] <Hamborgini> I think that odachi desperation attack has killed me more than any other red move in the game
[3:23:08] <%brisk_dacat> Guess he studied the blade a bit more than you
[3:23:11] <DXLelouch24> PARRY
[3:23:12] <amiavamp> it's pretty much unblockable too, the first swing will delete your ki
[3:23:14] <+Nomenanza> some of those red attacks from human enemies later on can be a bit bullshit
[3:23:25] <%kknutson4> The gun's headshots pierce helmets btw
[3:23:27] <Kghaleon> Desperation moves leave them wide open
[3:23:35] <DXLelouch24> You have to be ready to parry at a moments notice
[3:23:38] <DXLelouch24> On reaction
[3:23:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> slapped his head off
[3:23:43] <cricket42069> yeah these two are mean lol
[3:23:52] <+MushyCornbread> try not to get you butt kicked
[3:23:53] <+Axellogic> Yokai skills are great for keeping up your attack while recovering ki
[3:23:56] <%Blank9> you can monkey to jump up out of reach for a bit
[3:23:58] <srv4254> backhand decap
[3:24:17] <%Logoth_> ARROWED
[3:24:23] <TheeRabbi> Yu narrowly escaped being killed my a man wearing no pants
[3:24:35] <%DashXero> Oh. You can shoot people while they're down...?
[3:24:36] <+aWanderingKaivo> isn't it great coming back to a game and just getting it in a way you didn't before
[3:24:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[3:24:51] <Kghaleon> Guns practically one shot dudes with helmets
[3:24:53] <artoflec> LUL
[3:24:55] <%Dakuu75> LOL I love how they get decapitated by an arrow and their fucking heads do a flip
[3:24:55] <+Jasek7> rekt
[3:24:58] <%Visorak6> Nioh be like that
[3:24:59] <palruda> Enki attack can be used as a dodge for a lot of attacks
[3:25:00] <akitanito> oof
[3:25:07] <+Axellogic> Punishment for going down middle :V
[3:25:07] <cricket42069> pain
[3:25:10] <%jamsbybetty> ODATCH'D
[3:25:13] <%abrupt_abe> LUL
[3:25:18] <Ferakin> This is why the skill that lets you dodge and ki flux at the same time is great
[3:25:39] <%DashXero> Those were some sick i-frames
[3:25:44] <+bloodrune8864> Hey, now you know to shoot the guy off the building first
[3:25:50] <+Axellogic> They arent good at it but they have the same tools your do
[3:26:11] <GunneryGoblin> pretty sure all human enemies hae actual movesets with their weapon
[3:26:19] <%SirGO0SE> is that..sunlight? this game has sunlight?
[3:26:19] <+Jasek7> wtf you can zoom?
[3:26:24] <+Axellogic> if only there was another way to get to them
[3:26:49] <cricket42069> uwaaa
[3:27:02] <+aWanderingKaivo> lot of arrows used there
[3:27:16] <+Jasek7> oh wow
[3:27:22] <%holydeviant1> "Huh, lots of random arrows today."
[3:27:26] <BettyMwwaahh> pat. you just got mercd by him
[3:27:29] <akitanito> lol
[3:27:32] <cricket42069> loool
[3:27:35] <amiavamp> "Must've been the wind."
[3:27:39] <+Axellogic> The guy had no fear of giant demon hammer
[3:27:41] <samTUMZfestival> HEY PAT
[3:27:44] <artoflec> LUL
[3:27:45] <%Dakuu75> woah
[3:27:48] <+aWanderingKaivo> imagine having no pants and being brave enough to command grab a fucking yoked out yokai
[3:27:52] <TheeRabbi> My dude just mounted you with his cheeks clapping in the wind while you were in demon form
[3:27:52] <akitanito> "don't even care"
[3:27:57] <DSD24> Is Pat liking Nioh 2 so far?
[3:27:58] <ferbeholds> that guy woke up swinging
[3:28:11] <President_valentine> Yes he is
[3:28:16] <agustorm123> Fuck I cant wait for a sekiro 2
[3:28:18] <@Ranryu692> @DSD24 very much so
[3:28:21] <+Jasek7> Ko Dameron
[3:28:21] <+Axellogic> @DSD24 signifigantly less panic attacks so far
[3:28:22] <%holydeviant1> @aWanderingKaivo Magic rocks are a hell of a drug
[3:28:24] <amiavamp> Blue is treasure
[3:28:30] <johnsmith_746> is he playing on steam or console?
[3:28:31] <%SirGO0SE> certainly seems like he havin a good time
[3:28:33] <Kghaleon> @agustorm123 You mean Bloodborne 2
[3:28:42] <DSD24> @Ranryu692 @Axellogic Eyy that's great glad he's having a good time
[3:28:54] <DSD24> Fists and Odachi is a good combo
[3:29:01] <+pectusumbra> ah, I bet those are the bombs you need to use to unlock ninja stuff
[3:29:13] <agustorm123> @Kghaleon Wasnt bloodborne 2 just a Kart game? Kappa
[3:29:18] <%Blank9> yeah fists do great ki/stagger/fast attacks, odachi has the reach and damage
[3:29:27] <%Agami23> firebombs
[3:29:27] <Kghaleon> I think kitties allow you to use Yokai abilities endlessly?
[3:29:31] <%croxeye> look at that fat cat
[3:29:35] <+aWanderingKaivo> using bombs will give you points for ninjutsu yeah
[3:29:41] <%skeletonmilk> we bought our cats a cardboard izakaya and they take turns swapping shifts in there
[3:29:42] <+Jasek7> kitty heals
[3:29:42] <%Agami23> you can also use talismans and learn magic stuff
[3:29:44] <TerrifyingRei_05> CORB
[3:29:44] <Huntercd> plagueTaps plagueHarkness
[3:29:52] <@GeneralSCPatton> Yes, you can technically use those to grind an early skill point, but the first locks are in this level
[3:29:53] <President_valentine> They're called Scampuss
[3:29:57] <cricket42069> owne
[3:29:57] <+bloodrune8864> Don’t be afraid to use ninja or onmyo consumables, they give you experience towards those
[3:30:02] <DSD24> Ooo in English too
[3:30:05] <Shiro_Yutaro> fists go dummy end game
[3:30:08] <+Axellogic> Scampuss the ball
[3:30:15] <%Dakuu75> looks like a sky-diving flip
[3:30:23] <%DashXero> Yay.
[3:30:28] <scrumbotime> In my current run I went WILD with all the magics and items, straight up 30s in Magic Dexterity and Skill , it's wild
[3:30:30] <TheTakkster> woo naruto running
[3:30:35] <Huntercd> Fred Dursting it
[3:30:37] <amiavamp> When you find the better bombs (shrapnel) they actually hit pretty hard
[3:30:38] <GunneryGoblin> im almost certain you have to unlock the skill tree first, actually
[3:30:41] <%KngJester> the style on top of the drop down kills are so fucking unnecessary and i love it
[3:30:50] <vile_brand> you have a level.
[3:30:51] <Hamborgini> ooo lifedrain
[3:30:52] <artoflec> wow you got a boy that drains life when you hit a bullseye
[3:30:56] <artoflec> bow* LUL
[3:30:58] <+OctaivianRex> Blowing up shit with grenades is my ninja way dattobayo
[3:31:02] <DSD24> Spear is good in this game too
[3:31:03] <Parapattern> Slurp that gurp cuz it's purp
[3:31:08] <+aWanderingKaivo> certain omnyo especially really gives a big power boost
[3:31:12] <%SirGO0SE> y fat cat go away :(
[3:31:23] <+aWanderingKaivo> barrier talismans op
[3:31:24] <+Axellogic> there was a shortcut up there
[3:31:26] <President_valentine> Fall damage isn't too bad here
[3:31:26] <DSD24> Mage Builds in this game are really fun
[3:31:28] <+pectusumbra> I just know people mentioned the bombs earlier but I haven't played this so I don't know if there's other stuff involved
[3:31:43] <ferbeholds> bodied
[3:31:44] <unrelenting0> "You call throwing Dynamite around a martial art?"  "Hey, as long as it works."
[3:31:45] <amiavamp> gg no re
[3:31:50] <+rafaelba93> yellow flame besides souls means you can lvl up
[3:31:52] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @SirGO0SE He's not flat. He's fluffy. psaWrong
[3:31:55] <DSD24> and it matches!
[3:32:00] <Shiro_Yutaro> The bombs help unlock ninja arts early on
[3:32:00] <@GeneralSCPatton> R2 to compare
[3:32:06] <%Dakuu75> like 14
[3:32:06] <%DashXero> Which creature did that giant razor come from? Was it the horse thing?
[3:32:07] <Shiro_Yutaro> then you can go from there
[3:32:07] <%Visorak6> because higher number is not always better
[3:32:11] <%Visorak6> in this game
[3:32:11] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:32:16] <Hamborgini> I would like a button that just clears the ! out
[3:32:16] <+HellCopter> But best is relative
[3:32:20] <+Axellogic> That button would be hard to implement in this
[3:32:21] <BettyMwwaahh> the experience you get for ninjutsu and omnyo is linked to damage you do, so just check everything @patstaresat
[3:32:23] <+bloodrune8864> Yeah it’s the horse
[3:32:26] <+aWanderingKaivo> @DashXero the yokai move? yeah
[3:32:26] <DSD24> @DashXero I believe its the first boss
[3:32:28] <twistedhands> focus on toughness stat over raw defence
[3:32:37] <%RyTYoung> You can sort your inventory to show you the best weapons and armour
[3:32:39] <%DashXero> Thanks, guys!
[3:32:42] <%SirGO0SE> its SO weird
[3:32:45] <@Ranryu692> Light Souls
[3:32:46] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I figured with how good Pat is at Souls games that this would be no problem for him
[3:32:46] <%SirGO0SE> i didnt think this game even had sunlight
[3:32:47] <DSD24> Most Nioh levels were a night
[3:32:47] <grouchio> hows pat doing
[3:32:47] <amiavamp> It's like the level in Cry of Fear that's just a daytime suburb
[3:32:51] <zettig> It's comfy!
[3:32:52] <+Axellogic> YOu have proper shadows and shit
[3:32:53] <DSD24> So I get you Pat
[3:32:54] <+HellCopter> Sunset is romantic
[3:32:56] <TerrifyingRei_05> Can't you fashion-souls this by changing the looks of the item?
[3:33:03] <odnucaf3> Sekiro?
[3:33:08] <+pectusumbra> I mean it's late in the day. It reminds me of When They Cry a bit
[3:33:10] <DSD24> @TerrifyingRei_05 Yes you can!
[3:33:13] <Parapattern> It's just a Tuesday afternoon
[3:33:20] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Its suppose to be scary night time thingies, but daytime is jarring especially this dusk shit with the glare
[3:33:20] <TheTakkster> @PatStaresAt Is it like what a daylight stage in DbD would be like?
[3:33:21] <%DashXero> Not the only guy finding out.
[3:33:21] <twistedhands> @TerrifyingRei_05 yeah you can refashion anything to look like anything armor wise
[3:33:22] <TheMadBadger> @TurtlesAndTentacles Nioh is its own beast. You need to treat it differently
[3:33:23] <+sonofrobin73> Wait till you get to the DLC. The third one has some amazing environments
[3:33:26] <+aWanderingKaivo> @TerrifyingRei_05 yup, not till its unlocked though, will be soon
[3:33:26] <BettyMwwaahh> its annoying. I wanted that treasure!
[3:33:34] <rosemon5001> does the light hurt the goblins? Kappa
[3:33:38] <%Dakuu75> those are some baby-ass bomb
[3:33:54] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @themadbadger Ah I got you
[3:33:58] <%notsoy> helm breaker
[3:34:08] <+OctaivianRex> Pat stealing the technique of the undead burg hollows.
[3:34:08] <DSD24> Man its weird seeing this game at low levels again
[3:34:12] <President_valentine> monkey flip
[3:34:12] <+Axellogic> Hey pat sheath your sword while nuetral
[3:34:13] <%Dakuu75> WTF lol
[3:34:15] <%greasypete00> what if you went to do that move and the sword just bent
[3:34:15] <TerrifyingRei_05> It's great that you don't have to chose between the armor that looks cool and the armor that has better stats
[3:34:24] <%Agami23> oh its a longer version of the splitstaff skill
[3:34:24] <+Axellogic> YOu have cleaned the blood
[3:34:25] <akitanito> did you just polevault
[3:34:27] <GunneryGoblin> some moves are replacers
[3:34:29] <DSD24> Clean the blood
[3:34:29] <+Axellogic> YOu do a flourish
[3:34:34] <%TheAntiNihilist> spear had that
[3:34:36] <+HellCopter> It wipes the blood off in a cool way
[3:34:42] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt For style and hygiene
[3:34:53] <President_valentine> It looks especially cool with the fist
[3:34:56] <%Dakuu75> Odachi ftw
[3:35:00] <Hamborgini> I love low stance odachi
[3:35:05] <DSD24> Oh no
[3:35:16] <cricket42069> that man just complimented you lol
[3:35:17] <zettig> did anyone else "very good" just now?
[3:35:17] <+aWanderingKaivo> high stance unga
[3:35:27] <DSD24> Sword does get a lot good moves in this game
[3:35:31] <+theomnisoup> Has pat tried out the switch glaive or are his mind goblins too strong for it?
[3:35:34] <%RigmaroleHM> Hygiene?
[3:35:34] <agustorm123> Have you played psychonauts 2 pat?

[3:39:48] <DSD24> Hatchets are nice in this game
[3:39:49] <@GeneralSCPatton> You'll have plenty of ways to up the drop rate later
[3:39:51] <President_valentine> I got pretty luck with the core drops
[3:39:54] <+rafaelba93> you will have plenty soon enough
[3:39:55] <Huntercd> Toyo plagueHarkness zoneLick3 zoneLick1
[3:39:56] <GunneryGoblin> you're gonna fight that enemy four million more times, you'll get the core
[3:39:56] <DSD24> Oh hey its best girl
[3:39:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> aaaand there's the blacksmith
[3:40:04] <+Tucker0603> @patstaresat you think that's bad? try farming for boss moves
[3:40:06] <%SirGO0SE> eye patch waifu PogChamp
[3:40:07] <Shiro_Yutaro> Theres a quest with a guarateened one I think

[3:40:09] <+theomnisoup> yes
[3:40:10] <DSD24> Yes

[3:40:15] <grouchio> randma
[3:40:15] <zettig> yes
[3:40:15] <johnsmith_746> yes
[3:40:16] <+Axellogic> No she just looks really similatr
[3:40:16] <%tank7013> Ancestor I think
[3:40:18] <+aWanderingKaivo> or is she?
[3:40:18] <%cvp5127> ancestor
[3:40:18] <%DashXero> I didn't even know this game had english VO.
[3:40:19] <%valriot> Its her mom i think
[3:40:21] <srv4254> matadozo
[3:40:21] <+SilverDevilfish> Women in Nioh never age
[3:40:21] <BepBepAmShep> Don't think too hard about it
[3:40:22] <%abrupt_abe> Yesno
[3:40:23] <Hamborgini> she is similar, but not the same
[3:40:23] <%Agami23> this dub should make everyone who is british speak japanese
[3:40:24] <odnucaf3> Yes
[3:40:26] <vile_brand> why are the Japanese people british sounding?
[3:40:27] <+RemedyofRevenge> its eyepatchwolf
[3:40:29] <theshillman> oi guv'nah wot are you doin' 'ere
[3:40:29] <Jontman42> I don't actually know
[3:40:29] <%cvp5127> prequel pat
[3:40:30] <+rafaelba93> GREAT
[3:40:30] <%abrupt_abe> Asset reuse LUL
[3:40:31] <akitanito> reuse assets?
[3:40:34] <+aWanderingKaivo> its like nurse joy
[3:40:36] <cricket42069> it's just what blacksmiths do to protect their eyes from sparks
[3:40:38] <odnucaf3> She is Andre´s Daughter
[3:40:38] <%walternatorz> imagine having identical blacksmiths across several games
[3:40:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> qt tomboy smith
[3:40:44] <grouchio> Why is everyone speaking British
[3:40:47] <artoflec> like how muramasa is the same old man from Ninja Gaiden
[3:40:57] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[3:40:57] <%valriot> TRUE LUL
[3:40:58] <odnucaf3> She is the Same.
[3:40:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> sadge
[3:40:59] <%Dakuu75> damn...
[3:40:59] <cricket42069> it's the guard from a katana, so she can see thru the holes
[3:40:59] <%MidnightBurst12> true
[3:41:00] <@GeneralSCPatton> GOTTEM
[3:41:00] <akitanito> pfft
[3:41:01] <%Visorak6> Its probably because of VA strikes.
[3:41:02] <%RayReborne> DAMN
[3:41:04] <DSD24> Bri' ish
[3:41:04] <+SilverDevilfish> Because British VA's are cheaper
[3:41:05] <%cooldude69xx> That isnt true. British people dont exist
[3:41:07] <+wizard_of_diamonds> BRUTAL
[3:41:08] <+TheRockingM> LUL
[3:41:10] <Hamborgini> many of the characters in this game are war criminals, so it works pretty well I think
[3:41:10] <+aWanderingKaivo> Toyo of Astora
[3:41:10] <+Axellogic> @grouchio its the FF14 voice studio
[3:41:14] <%Dakuu75> lol
[3:41:15] <%MechArch> psaLiz
[3:41:16] <captainnathaniel> and also pat is playing the dub
[3:41:20] <%notsoy> muramasa chopping people up was one of the best parts of NG2
[3:41:21] <grouchio> Queen dying soon
[3:41:21] <TurtlesAndTentacles> SAVAGE
[3:41:21] <+haitakaa> poor clemps
[3:41:21] <toahmes> The eyepatch is like an for of goggle to protect their eye
[3:41:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> wat're u tryna say bout muh accent KKona
[3:41:22] <%captain_thickthighs> oh that reminds me Pat have you seen the rumors that supposedly the queen is actually dead and they're keeping it hush hush It's in tabloids but it's still kind of funny to think about
[3:41:27] <grouchio> Watch it happen next month
[3:41:31] <%valriot> keep eating your national dish of chip and gravy LUL
[3:41:33] <BarnYardFiddler> 80 percent of actors in big movies are brititsh
[3:41:34] <robotlunatic> RIP Elizabeth II
[3:41:37] <%DashXero> I love that dempsey roll move so much!
[3:41:38] <Jontman42> but Pat you're British with extra steps
[3:41:39] <amiavamp> Look at them godrays
[3:41:40] <TheTakkster> Popular media needs more newfie accents
[3:41:41] <dan_g_v> makes sense
[3:41:43] <+TheRockingM> As an Australian I wholly endorse making fun of the british
[3:41:56] <DSD24> Big Cave with the Bat Lady
[3:41:58] <Hamborgini> this game has my favorite version of a water temple ever
[3:42:03] <artoflec> what the ninja village? i like that level a lot
[3:42:03] <%greasypete00> IS THAT A LITTLE GREY ALIEN
[3:42:06] <%Visorak6> Dude the boss fights are way better too
[3:42:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> there's an upcoming level that has a really cool thing in it it's nice
[3:42:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> this game's got caves yo
[3:42:10] <%Blank9> these go big
[3:42:10] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I have a ton of points.i should spend them
[3:42:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> all over
[3:42:13] <GunneryGoblin> that helmet really pulls your outfit apart at the seams huh
[3:42:14] <+McSoliace> you don't even know how right you are
[3:42:17] <grouchio> SEE HOW NIOH 2 KICKS SO MUCH ASS
[3:42:18] <shiny_prinny> just a massive improvement on nearly every aspect of Nioh 1
[3:42:22] <Kghaleon> Nioh 1 story was good tho
[3:42:31] <Ferakin> Hey remember Princess Mononoke
[3:42:32] <Ahack13> So this mind goblin died pretty easy, huh?
[3:42:36] <DSD24> Nioh 1 story had some cool moments
[3:42:43] <+UltraViolet371> they really made it feel like you're walking into a demon's souls level, i love it
[3:42:47] <+aWanderingKaivo> drowned
[3:42:50] <Jontman42> Nioh 2 basically improves on all of 1's shortcomings
[3:42:54] <Hamborgini> you can't name your character
[3:42:56] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah its hideyoshi
[3:42:58] <amiavamp> Some of the revenants are dev-placed
[3:43:00] <GunneryGoblin> you dont get to name your character
[3:43:00] <Kghaleon> Nioh 1 you're cool western dude in Japan, this game you're random japanese man
[3:43:01] <srv4254> is this a one off stream i hope not
[3:43:07] <DSD24> Hide is their name
[3:43:11] <+Axellogic> nope you can name creations but you dont name the character you are always Hide
[3:43:13] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt itits just a massive improvement. and the DLCs are even better
[3:43:13] <+bloodrune8864> That’s an npc spirit
[3:43:18] <%SirGO0SE> nice!
[3:43:19] <%RyTYoung> This game plays a lot different imo
[3:43:19] <@Lion_kun> WE TOLD YOU IT WAS BETTER
[3:43:19] <grouchio> WE WILL LOVE THIS
[3:43:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeyeyeyeyeye
[3:43:21] <+aWanderingKaivo> ye ye LP
[3:43:22] <+rafaelba93> its easier to get into
[3:43:23] <+bloodrune8864> You should fight him
[3:43:23] <%Valdorick> Valdorick subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Hey Pat, I've been trying combat a Mind Goblin of my own, and failing horribly. The Goblin is Loss Aversion, and its a bitch to fight against not save scumming or outright cheating to not lose something in X-COM, or Rimworld, or even Total Warhammer. Fuck
[3:43:24] <%SirGO0SE> happy to hear t hat
[3:43:26] <grouchio> Do the whole thing
[3:43:27] <%MechArch> psaDogchamp
[3:43:28] <srv4254> yeyeye
[3:43:29] <@GeneralSCPatton> Thanks, I love it
[3:43:29] <penitentpendant> Huzzah
[3:43:30] <%DianaTheAscian> I'm enjoying it
[3:43:33] <%Blank9> yeahhhhh
[3:43:35] <DSD24> @Kghaleon Well there's character creation so you can be a lady too
[3:43:37] <theshillman> we hope you do
[3:43:37] <grouchio> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[3:43:41] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt trust me dude, the bosses in the DLC are going to make
[3:43:41] <artoflec> this game is so long if you do all the side missions though HahaSweat
[3:43:41] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat no your name is Hide, cant name your character
[3:43:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> glad you're liking it after bouncing off before
[3:43:44] <+rafaelba93> i ll be here
[3:43:46] <SaltyFront> how goes the fight against the goblins?
[3:43:47] <Kghaleon> Liking skipping Dark souls to Dark souls 3 because the gameplay is better
[3:43:47] <DSD24> The DLC in this game is great btw
[3:43:54] <+Rofiarf> awesome
[3:43:54] <maskedmook> I mean this stream is gonna make me buy the game so ye
[3:43:56] <+HellCopter> I can't think of any point that this game frustrated me like Nioh 1 did, it was cool all the way
[3:44:02] <+Axellogic> Might fuck with your muscle memeory a little though :V
[3:44:05] <GemeSvev> Tell me more pat
[3:44:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> what's elder thing
[3:44:07] <+rafaelba93> huh, never heard of it
[3:44:08] <%RyTYoung> I thought a good warm up was a From Soft marathon Kappa
[3:44:10] <%kknutson4> Going back to a souls game after Nioh might be rough tho
[3:44:10] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt What company is producing it?
[3:44:12] <+ALazo> what's this elden ring game about?
[3:44:12] <cricket42069> what's elden ring?
[3:44:12] <+flipsilog> never heard of it.. what is it?
[3:44:16] <Hamborgini> is that about newlyweds in the retirement home?
[3:44:17] <DSD24> Lets go
[3:44:19] <SaltyFront> AXE MAN
[3:44:21] <+Axellogic> YOu can get his outfit
[3:44:22] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> i feel that the lack of stupid combos on elden ring might make the experience worst
[3:44:23] <Jontman42> as long as you don't get fucked by the control differences
[3:44:27] <+ALazo> steal his clothes
[3:44:30] <President_valentine> Magic man
[3:44:31] <%FunkyStreams> YOU GUYS DONT KnOW WHAT ELDEN RING IS ?!?!?
[3:44:31] <+pectusumbra> yo that dude's dressed as a tengu?!
[3:44:33] <akitanito> but are you cooler?
[3:44:34] <Huntercd> @patstaresat you mean Dark Souls 4?
[3:44:35] <SaltyFront> oh wait you're jacking him up, nvm lol
[3:44:37] <twistedhands> you can get his armor
[3:44:39] <%epide> you can get him to walk in the fire
[3:44:40] <%RayReborne> GIVE psaDab PATRON psaDab ANIME psaDab TITTIES Kappa
[3:44:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can get his armor soon as well, it looks great
[3:44:47] <akitanito> he didn't do shit
[3:44:47] <+HellCopter> The hatchet man
[3:44:50] <grouchio> Prepah for tha end
[3:44:50] <%cooldude69xx> @FunkyStreams Does it have a discord?
[3:44:51] <+pectusumbra> oh did you get his armor just now?
[3:44:52] <cricket42069> that man did a murder on me
[3:44:54] <ferbeholds> yeah
[3:44:58] <DXLelouch24> Hes a Yokai Hunter
[3:45:02] <+rafaelba93> i think i did that
[3:45:04] <amiavamp> A lot of guides recommend getting everything to 20
[3:45:04] <+bravofifeniner> Why just 10?
[3:45:04] <Ferakin> Nah, everything at level 10 or 20 is pretty good in Nioh
[3:45:05] <zettig> no, that's actually ideal
[3:45:05] <+pectusumbra> got some curass
[3:45:05] <+aWanderingKaivo> getting all stats to 10 is actually good in this
[3:45:06] <odnucaf3> Youkai Habilities does not consume Stamina.
[3:45:06] <%maskofmichael> Who's GRR Martin? ELDEN RING THESE NUTZ!
[3:45:07] <artoflec> i like to do that too, i wonder if its an OCD thing for me - evening out the number
[3:45:09] <Jontman42> nah that works for now
[3:45:09] <TheMadBadger> That's fine as a base build
[3:45:10] <Ferakin> Every stat increases health anyway
[3:45:11] <%Blank9> you def want everything to get to 10, maybe 15 or 20
[3:45:12] <didgereedoodah> that's not a bad idea
[3:45:13] <Laecerelius> going kinda even in your stats isn't that bad in this game
[3:45:13] <+greeam> no thats how you do nioh 2 lol
[3:45:14] <Kghaleon> I did that and had to respec because my character was dying repeatedly
[3:45:14] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt the DLC bosses go full anime on you
[3:45:14] <+HellCopter> You have like a gajillion levels, get enough to play around with magic/ninjas at the least
[3:45:15] <vnzuelandude> good game is good
[3:45:18] <%Paperware> that's actually a good plan
[3:45:19] <%FunkyStreams> @cooldude69xx lol
[3:45:19] <+HefestoForges> it's the sohaya cuirass
[3:45:22] <%Blank9> softcaps are HUGE
[3:45:22] <+HefestoForges> but it's white
[3:45:32] <+bloodrune8864> There’s soft caps for most of them at about 10
[3:45:32] <+HellCopter> Overwhelming force
[3:45:34] <Jontman42> it's actually good to improve everything at the start
[3:45:34] <DSD24> Dempsey Roll!
[3:45:34] <grouchio> pfffffft
[3:45:35] <ferbeholds> i did everytthing 20 in my firstt playthough and tried every weapon
[3:45:35] <BarnYardFiddler> Go with your gut Arry
[3:45:37] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat get every stat to 20 then go nuts, this is the way
[3:45:37] <%SirGO0SE> i cant get over how fucking sick these fist weapons are
[3:45:39] <twistedhands> A good beginner advice is to level everything to 20 so you can try everything out.  but if you don't have any plans to use magic you can ignore it.
[3:45:40] <GhoulishCripple> I love the fact your soul counter glows yellow when you have at least 1 level worth of notsouls
[3:45:44] <akitanito> just punch everything dead
[3:45:45] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I farmed him for his gear for quite a while
[3:45:45] <SaltyFront> lol, dempsey rolled his ass
[3:45:47] <President_valentine> Yokai realm
[3:45:49] <%KngJester> the fist weapons just hit different
[3:45:49] <+McSoliace> don't forget the ki pulse attack
[3:45:55] <Kghaleon> lol that's bad
[3:45:55] <%valriot> pretty much
[3:45:56] <%KngJester> out here with the dempsey roll
[3:46:03] <Jontman42> yeah everything to 20 is a good start
[3:46:05] <+Axellogic> It does
[3:46:06] <TheMadBadger> Maybe not 20, i'd only say 10
[3:46:07] <+rafaelba93> yep
[3:46:08] <%Blank9> dark zone lets you spam yokai abilities more
[3:46:14] <%RayReborne> Holy fuck Pat lmao psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[3:46:16] <%Dakuu75> wut?
[3:46:18] <+rafaelba93> its the best
[3:46:18] <%kknutson4> It did that in the first game too
[3:46:20] <%athuramn> yeah 20 seems excessive tbh
[3:46:21] <TigerCrownPorter> everything to 20 is good for first playthrough
[3:46:23] <Kghaleon> That's like blowing dozens of levels on stuff you don't need
[3:46:34] <Ferakin> I can't tell if the oni guys are bigger losers here or in 1
[3:46:36] <TigerCrownPorter> @Kghaleon You get re-rolls mate
[3:46:39] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You should also get into magic when you can cause magic rules on this game
[3:46:42] <Ferakin> It's just so easy to destroy their horns in 2
[3:46:43] <DSD24> I love the Yokai Critical Hit now
[3:46:47] <%KngJester> BODY BODY BODY BODY BODY
[3:46:48] <twistedhands> and it's easy to respec so you don't need to worry about wasting points on stuff you don't want
[3:46:52] <+HellCopter> Slappers
[3:46:53] <%HotSauceFiend> I just popped in. I am literally playing this game right now lol. on dlc
[3:46:54] <DSD24> It was sorely missing in Nioh 1
[3:46:57] <Jontman42> everything to 20 gives you enough options to try everything tho
[3:46:57] <+Axellogic> rarr raar raaar
[3:47:00] <Kghaleon> @TigerCrownPorter You get respec.
[3:47:06] <+bloodrune8864> You can always respec later, so don’t even worry about it
[3:47:09] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> 10 is best. after that, it's diminishing returns.
[3:47:12] <shiny_prinny> command grab
[3:47:13] <SaltyFront> this looks sick af, damn
[3:47:19] <DSD24> Yoki is a good one
[3:47:20] <grouchio> holy fuck and I was already having fun with Nioh 1
[3:47:25] <+aWanderingKaivo> nah don't do that
[3:47:27] <%RayReborne> more like just put into what you want, i did a jack of all trades build and it worked fine for base game
[3:47:28] <+HellCopter> Resting rites is to sell it
[3:47:28] <DSD24> Nah you don't want that
[3:47:30] <+pectusumbra> x is a trash all button
[3:47:31] <+ALazo> do it
[3:47:33] <%athuramn> if it's easy to respec then that's even more reason to not dump everything to 20 and just respec when your current stat dump becomes inefficient
[3:47:33] <+Axellogic> its a quick menu so you can drop new cores you dont want
[3:47:35] <%SharkMissile> Resting Rites deletes a core in exchange for possibly rare mats
[3:47:36] <+sonofrobin73> That sacrifices the spirit for rare items
[3:47:37] <@Lion_kun> Resting rites is when you crunch your doubles for materials
[3:47:45] <GhoulishCripple> resting rites breaks it into forging pieces shiftling exp
[3:47:49] <@GeneralSCPatton> Materials and Shiftlling XP
[3:47:50] <%epide> honestly i think this is one of the best way to get new skills in gameing
[3:47:51] <%Blank9> I like all to 20 because every stat does something and weapons don't scale that hard off them
[3:47:55] <+Local16> Mezuki is the carry soul core tbh
[3:47:57] <+Axellogic> Boss cores are expensive
[3:47:57] <%Visorak6> gotta level your spirit
[3:48:10] <@Lion_kun> OH NO HE'S MINMAXING
[3:48:10] <%Dakuu75> Gone, gone the form of man. Arise the demon Etrigan~!
[3:48:12] <%cooldude69xx> Is it true FF 14 patched out the squapes?
[3:48:13] <+bloodrune8864> But yes, 10 is where you’ll get the most significant bonus for most stats, you don’t really need to go further than that
[3:48:13] <twistedhands> you wanna keep mezuki tbh
[3:48:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> This game just throws an ungodly amount of effects and stats and icons at you
[3:48:14] <%HotSauceFiend> Resting rites also levels the shiftling abilities
[3:48:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> lmao someone died offscreen LUL
[3:48:28] <Kghaleon> Cores have levels so you replace them constantly
[3:48:34] <%HotSauceFiend> I forgot to ask, does this game activate goblins in your head
[3:48:34] <TerrifyingRei_05> max-minning
[3:48:36] <GilliamYaeger> @cooldude69xx Yes, they levelled up from PS1 to PS2
[3:48:37] <Jontman42> yeees do it get deep in there
[3:48:42] <amiavamp> You can attune from the Guardian Spirit screen too, it's easier there
[3:48:54] <Jontman42> become the numbers game
[3:48:55] <+Axellogic> You likely were helped by the peek at Nioh 1, so you got the stat goblins out of the way a little. Then this one being much more clear and having more tools feels better
[3:49:11] <%cooldude69xx> @cooldude69xx That game sucks
[3:49:14] <%RayReborne> attunement cost is too high for Yoki and Mezuki on one Spirit
[3:49:14] <GhoulishCripple> @patstaresat when you encounter a sudama (purple kodama) give it a yokai core, it can give you a special Soul in return
[3:49:15] <@Lion_kun> For the whole game I stuck to Enki and Namahage
[3:49:25] <+aWanderingKaivo> wow that did a lot
[3:49:26] <DSD24> So good
[3:49:27] <@Lion_kun> Namahage has an amazing dps attack
[3:49:27] <artoflec> lmao get fucked dude
[3:49:28] <DXLelouch24> Pat look at Beyond Infinity in your fist skills,THAT is the skill you want the most
[3:49:31] <+Axellogic> YOu got his mask
[3:49:31] <DSD24> You got his mask!
[3:49:33] <+pectusumbra> got his mask, nice
[3:49:33] <+aWanderingKaivo> I never used yoki soul core much
[3:49:38] <%DashXero> Got his mask.
[3:49:39] <%Broand> Cool mask get?
[3:49:41] <%Blank9> you can make entire builds around random yokai cores
[3:49:42] <%Blank9> it's great
[3:49:43] <shiny_prinny> command grab on humans, yoki rules
[3:49:49] <+Axellogic> Hes a normal enemy pat
[3:49:51] <%Dapper_Cactuar> yoki soul core wrecks human enemies
[3:49:52] <%DashXero> He's not a miniboss.
[3:49:55] <%PatchTheSquid> You also get prestige levels
[3:49:55] <GhoulishCripple> you used a shrine
[3:49:58] <%SharkMissile> Yeah that's just a guy
[3:50:02] <ferbeholds> its good against single enemy but leaves you a bit open at the end
[3:50:05] <%Dakuu75> sic
[3:50:14] <cricket42069> he's not cool anymore, this guy
[3:50:15] <%Hamborgini> Hamborgini subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Nioh 2 is one of my favorite games of the last decade. I'm happy to see you enjoying it!
[3:50:17] <soflicar> this game loves changing tough enimies to basic enimies
[3:50:23] <zettig> You have to beat the one with red flowers all around him to get rid of all the enemies in the area.
[3:50:23] <+Axellogic> Good news is if you clear a dark realm all the yokai that were in it stay dead
[3:50:28] <+aWanderingKaivo> there's another one
[3:50:40] <%epide> I LOVE the soul of those small dudes
[3:50:42] <%doctordinkus> doctordinkus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Thank you for playing games that bebby like me is scared to play because I'm bad, gonna go play vrchat
[3:50:57] <+Crunchy_the_clown> yup
[3:50:59] <Kghaleon> Sad to tell you, but bosses are harder in this game
[3:50:59] <%RayReborne> Yuuuuup
[3:51:01] <yukichocomilk> yeah dude
[3:51:01] <%DashXero> YUP.
[3:51:03] <%SharkMissile> Ye
[3:51:05] <DSD24> Plus the Character Creation is great in this game
[3:51:11] <amiavamp> getting bodied
[3:51:14] <Jontman42> uh huh
[3:51:14] <+bravofifeniner> Whats funny is that he's not even scratching the surface yet
[3:51:16] <President_valentine> Nioh 1 is good but 2 is so much better
[3:51:16] <%HotSauceFiend> Its fantastic compared to Nioh 1
[3:51:19] <%athuramn> we all nod in solemn agreement
[3:51:27] <%Hamborgini> I want to see some gaki cannibalism tonight
[3:51:30] <DSD24> I mean there are some story beats that are pretty nice if you played Nioh 1
[3:51:32] <Jontman42> 2 is so fucking good man
[3:51:35] <%DianaTheAscian> This has also sold me on trying Nioh 2
[3:51:36] <GhoulishCripple> best character creator in years. my guy has a frog tattoo on his back ala Yakuza
[3:51:36] <%epide> @DSD24 yeah and you can use it when your home 2
[3:51:38] <+Axellogic> Pats so lucky monkey didnt see him
[3:51:45] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt you wont get bored with the combat in this. if you get bored of the odachi and the fists there are like, 7 other weapons for you to master
[3:51:51] <+cheerfulnpc> I mean, don't get us wrong, Nioh 1 is still a great game.  Nioh 2 just that much better.
[3:51:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah, you gotta lear that or else it's over
[3:51:59] <%Vyskus> yeah, I suck at Ki Pulse, and definitely bounced off this game
[3:52:01] <+UltraViolet371> I've seen some crazies say 1 was better, but we don't listen to them, they crazy
[3:52:04] <@GeneralSCPatton> I cycle all 3 stances with each pulse
[3:52:11] <artoflec> nice LUL
[3:52:15] <@Lion_kun> worth it
[3:52:16] <%Dakuu75> there can only be ONE~!!!
[3:52:18] <DSD24> @epide What I liked doing was changing my characters look as the in game years go by
[3:52:18] <+Axellogic> Those enemies will stay dead now
[3:52:21] <+cheerfulnpc> @captainnathaniel More than that.
[3:52:22] <%SirGO0SE> ooo purple dual uchi
[3:52:26] <%SirGO0SE> is that a good
[3:52:27] <%athuramn> ooh liberal use of yokai form, I love it (y)
[3:52:28] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt I'd say that the ki pulse is about as important to Nioh as parrying is to Sekiro
[3:52:29] <GhoulishCripple> @patstaresat and you can turn the ki pulse into a dodge as well. legit almost everything can be a Ki pulse now
[3:52:36] <artoflec> fuckin like 60 hours
[3:52:37] <+SilverDevilfish> LONG
[3:52:39] <%Djinnazz> 30-40
[3:52:40] <Mr_Rakjo> Long
[3:52:41] <%shootbang_exe> does long as shit work
[3:52:41] <%SharkMissile> Jesus, like 50 hours
[3:52:42] <+Axellogic> Depends on how you want to play it,
[3:52:42] <%valriot> 60?
[3:52:42] <%SharkMissile> LONG
[3:52:43] <%DashXero> It's LONG.
[3:52:43] <DSD24> Uh 100 ish?
[3:52:43] <+nolawg> 70 hours id say
[3:52:43] <%maskofmichael> 420 years
[3:52:43] <+bellicoseweeb> 150 hours
[3:52:44] <IntrepidEye> VERY
[3:52:44] <%Visorak6> long
[3:52:45] <Mr_Rakjo> LONG LONG
[3:52:47] <President_valentine> Pretty long
[3:52:47] <%RayReborne> without dlc is like 50 hours dude
[3:52:48] <%HotSauceFiend> PHew, you can beat this in 50-60 hours
[3:52:49] <@GeneralSCPatton> NINJA POINT BAYBEE!
[3:52:49] <%Djinnazz> for the first play through
[3:52:49] <+HellCopter> Depends if you're completionist
[3:52:54] <%epide> @DSD24 i dont tend to do that but I LOVE THE FACT YOU CAN
[3:52:55] <artoflec> longer than dark souls 3
[3:52:55] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah I'd say so
[3:52:56] <yukichocomilk> yeah
[3:52:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's a whole ass video game
[3:52:57] <+HellCopter> There are lots of sidemissions you don't need to do
[3:52:58] <%Visorak6> yes
[3:53:00] <%baka_sugoi> OwO
[3:53:00] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> More like dark souls 2
[3:53:01] <grouchio> 150-200 hours
[3:53:01] <amiavamp> Depends on if you get stuck on a boss
[3:53:02] <%AgniBrandt> 40-60 hours first playthrough
[3:53:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> a full as game
[3:53:04] <%Dapper_Cactuar> long but a LOT better paced and with a better flow  than the first game
[3:53:04] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt depends on how much you want to play. there are NG+, the abyss, etc
[3:53:04] <@Lion_kun> Pat, if you wanna feel really good, invest in a tank build. I made a regen health build with tonfas and I was unkillable, I didn't even need to dodge, just attack and regain any health lost.
[3:53:05] <ArgentUndaCova> with all DLCs? It's like 80-90ish?
[3:53:06] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt I did around 80ish for my first playthrough with all the dlc
[3:53:09] <+pectusumbra> oh, did pat get an ninja point?
[3:53:10] <+sonofrobin73> Yeah, but the game actually has MORE content after that
[3:53:10] <+nolawg> if u min max likea  boss then its for sure 70+
[3:53:12] <srv4254> dont need to do every sub misssion
[3:53:15] <%DashXero> I got a hundred hours in and gave up.
[3:53:16] <+Axellogic> You can potentionally bumrush content but they expect your to do NG+ difficulties for the new loot types
[3:53:17] <Kghaleon> DLCs continue the story, so people that skip them are lamers. HahaDoge
[3:53:17] <%Hamborgini> new mechanics open up with every NG+, so that extends the time by a bit if you're into it
[3:53:20] <%baka_sugoi> Das a WHOLE ASS GAM
[3:53:21] <IntrepidEye> The DLC is pretty good though
[3:53:24] <@Lion_kun> Should work with fists as well since fists also have high dps
[3:53:26] <%W1nterTitan> howlongtobeat put Main + Extra at 80 hours
[3:53:27] <%athuramn> not including all sub missions yeah
[3:53:27] <DSD24> @epide Plus sometimes you just want to change the look up a bit too
[3:53:28] <%kknutson4> Depends if you skip twilight/side missions
[3:53:31] <+cheerfulnpc> Also New Game+ is actually really fun.  As is New Game++, etc.
[3:53:32] <President_valentine> get the backstabbing
[3:53:34] <%HotSauceFiend> Being a completionist in this game is a nightmare what with the smithing text and such
[3:53:36] <+Axellogic> Sneak attack is in the bottom tree
[3:53:42] <mental_mashup> Big number go up
[3:53:43] <%HotSauceFiend> GUNPOWDer Bom
[3:53:45] <@Lion_kun> Pat can do twilight missions offscreen
[3:53:47] <%SirGO0SE> this games pretty much always on sale somewhere too right?
[3:53:48] <%Visorak6> tiger run is "I cant be fucked"
[3:53:48] <%Agami23> shuriken is better rock
[3:53:49] <Jontman42> DLC has some of the coolest stuff in the game
[3:53:50] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt Do tiger run so you can get backstab
[3:53:51] <%MelBrooksKA> @PatStaresAt When the DLC came out, German Spy and his publisher had to give up writing a guide
[3:53:54] <GilliamYaeger> Get shuriken
[3:53:54] <%RayReborne> yep lol
[3:53:56] <@GeneralSCPatton> I like to grab paralysis juice after the poison. Decent buff item.
[3:54:04] <+Inferno_Icon> at least its level based tho so easy to divide up for streams
[3:54:04] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt just the Abyss will give you hours of content to play if you want. plus the special bosses that will kick your ass for hours
[3:54:07] <GilliamYaeger> Tiger Running is good for speedrun
[3:54:07] <%HotSauceFiend> Shuriken can eventually get you cool stuff too
[3:54:09] <+aWanderingKaivo> these are like spells in dark souls 1, you prepare them at shrines and have a set use before resting
[3:54:11] <Kghaleon> Lot of people love Sloth
[3:54:13] <stormhawk9891> Eh, Tiger running is good for boss runs
[3:54:14] <+sonofrobin73> Tiger running is semi-useful for speedrunning levels
[3:54:14] <%epide> @DSD24 yeah im just glad that they didnt segment it like ffxiv
[3:54:18] <%Dakuu75> DUDE~!!! the sword on the back of your waist is clipping out the sheath @PatStaresAt
[3:54:20] <+HellCopter> The "run to the boss for the 15th time" scroll
[3:54:20] <GhoulishCripple> pat you have a Shiftling point
[3:54:21] <+Axellogic> I usually learn the bombs first for leveling then beeline for the sneak attack
[3:54:23] <+AngryPhant0m> the sneak attack only works agaist humans
[3:54:24] <Jontman42> get the ninja stard like the weeb you are
[3:54:26] <amiavamp> You're going to get a lot of conflicting advice on what magic and ninjutsu to use lol
[3:54:36] <%HotSauceFiend> @captainnathaniel how do you unlock the abyss, I just finsihed tengu dlc havent seen it yet
[3:54:38] <amiavamp> you can sneak attack yokai
[3:54:38] <+Axellogic> IT works on yokai too but doesnt grab
[3:54:38] <Vakojin> You can grind ninja xp just by popping the scroll
[3:54:40] <%Visorak6> for now
[3:54:41] <DSD24> "I was 50 percent of the enemies back in Nioh 1!"
[3:54:41] <+cheerfulnpc> Those things freak me out for some reason.
[3:54:46] <Ferakin> Well, sneak attack only has special animations for humans
[3:54:48] <+sonofrobin73> Sneak attack works against everything, just the animation only works on humans
[3:54:48] <+bloodrune8864> You can set a node as your “goal” so you can keep track of what you need to unlock it
[3:54:48] <@GeneralSCPatton> You can still sneak attack yokai, it just won't be a grapple
[3:54:50] <Kghaleon> Game likes to alternate between humand and yokai areas
[3:54:51] <Ferakin> It still does extra damage for yokai
[3:54:53] <+cheerfulnpc> Sneak attacks work on Yokai, it just doesn't play a special animation
[3:54:54] <shiny_prinny> sneak works on yokai too just no grab
[3:54:57] <GhoulishCripple> that guy lied. you just don't get the special animation I've 100% sneak attacked yokai
[3:54:57] <DSD24> You got that Cool Doods mask btw
[3:54:58] <%HotSauceFiend> Sneak attack works on Yokai as well, just gives extra damage and maybe a drop doesn't it?
[3:55:01] <captainnathaniel> @HotSauceFiend i think the abyss is after the last DLC
[3:55:10] <+gfb537> Sneak absolutely works on yokai.  It's just no t agrab.
[3:55:11] <%Monkeyweed21> The sneak attack just does extra damage to yokai
[3:55:40] <GhoulishCripple> you stab them with you'd Hide knife
[3:55:47] <+Inferno_Icon> sneak attack does work on yokai but no backstab animation just damage
[3:55:57] <DSD24> Like Spear!
[3:56:05] <%HotSauceFiend> I do love that the music queues in when there is actual danger to your character. Like being surrounded or low health
[3:56:11] <President_valentine> all the weapons are fun
[3:56:13] <@Lion_kun> So did you guys like to switch stances, I was pretty much a one stance guy.
[3:56:18] <+pectusumbra> I'll be looking at the magic weapons when I get to this
[3:56:19] <yukichocomilk> do people need to talk about sneak attack 100x?
[3:56:22] <@Lion_kun> High stance Tonfa for life
[3:56:33] <yukichocomilk> I switch a lot while attacking
[3:56:33] <%Dakuu75> dude... the fucking knife is cliping out the sheath, I can't NOT see it
[3:56:34] <+Crunchy_the_clown> I love the tonfas
[3:56:34] <twistedhands> always be switching stances
[3:56:37] <Kghaleon> @Lion_kun switching on the fly is big helpful
[3:56:41] <efratzy> high stance fist can just melt everything
[3:56:41] <DSD24> @Lion_kun Depends on the weapon, but for Dual Swords I was Low Stance all the time
[3:56:45] <shiny_prinny> tonfa are ki destroyers i love them
[3:56:46] <%RayReborne> playing with other weapons for the fuck of it is totally viable. Tonfas and Switchglaives are REAL SOLID
[3:56:47] <+HellCopter> High stance switchglaive unless a boss really called for otherwise
[3:56:47] <%HotSauceFiend> Stamina Build foreva. Axes and Swords life
[3:56:48] <DXLelouch24> Its fist you have to switch stances
[3:56:49] <%AHomeschoolDropout> the bois in my free company are peer pressuring me to become a catgirl what do @PatStaresAt
[3:56:51] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Lion_kun I was at first but switching is really useful if only for different dodges, and the flux skill encourages it anyway. I switch all the time
[3:56:52] <%Monkeyweed21> @lion_kun flux is super important you really want to stance switch
[3:56:52] <twistedhands> but i mostly used the switchglaive which wants you to rapidly switch between stances
[3:56:53] <GhoulishCripple> @lion_kun with Switchglaive I switch constantly but that's because you can sort of have infinite stamina if you do it right when switching
[3:56:53] <DXLelouch24> Or its unoptimal
[3:56:55] <+BoboDaHobo> hes fucking that ladder
[3:56:56] <%baka_sugoi> psaDogchamp "BLESS H2O"
[3:56:57] <shadoke> just got here. Does Pat like this better than one?
[3:57:05] <CeJaxon> the Split Staff was alot of fun to use its just a shame its a magic weapon
[3:57:05] <@Ranryu692> yes
[3:57:07] <@Lion_kun> My brain just wasn't suited for switching, I just stuck to high stance tonfas or mid stance odachi
[3:57:13] <President_valentine> @shadoke way more
[3:57:22] <%Dakuu75> @shadoke by a country mile
[3:57:25] <Kghaleon> Minimap shows you the direction of the goal
[3:57:26] <+Axellogic> you are above the village ou cleared
[3:57:32] <%Monkeyweed21> @ahomeschooldropout become a cat or bunny boo and then act even sluttier
[3:57:34] <amiavamp> When you break the dark realm, all the yokai in it lose their ki
[3:57:40] <+Axellogic> When you clear a dark realm all the yokai in it lose their ki
[3:57:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Boi
[3:57:48] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt When u break a youmi area it disables all the youkai in it
[3:57:51] <%athuramn> I forget but I think I changed the controls a bit to make stance switching easier @lion_kun
[3:57:54] <+aWanderingKaivo> you don't HAVE to switch stances but its definitely beneficial and makes the game more fun imo, there is so much variety in movesets even for just one weapon
[3:57:55] <TheeRabbi> Have you just tried not being lost?
[3:57:59] <@Lion_kun> I know I was denying myself some fun mid and low stance moves but sticking to the moves I knew was betetr for my game I felt.
[3:58:00] <DanXaliberc> @lion_kun I am the same I’d high stance everything
[3:58:20] <@Lion_kun> High stance tonfa has some killer dps moves
[3:58:20] <%Monkeyweed21> Yokai al#so don’t respawn if you clear the dark realm
[3:58:33] <+cheerfulnpc> Speaking of switching stances, it's a good habit to switch to low stance specifically for dodging.
[3:58:36] <%HotSauceFiend> Switching stances can be great when you know which attacks destroy ki meter and which have high damage
[3:59:01] <+F0u1Play> RIPCheer10l
[3:59:02] <+aWanderingKaivo> mostly I switch to mid/low for any weapon when I need to be defensive, high to start out fights or to really go in on damage in an opening, etc
[3:59:04] <President_valentine> I switched stances because I found it fun
[3:59:15] <%Monkeyweed21> @lion_kun combine the ki shred with the elemental jutsu and it’s REAL good
[3:59:15] <Kghaleon> Low stance greatly reduces stamina consumption so switching to it during combat can really save you
[3:59:21] <TheeRabbi> heh
[3:59:34] <youngking_kush> Stance Switching is essentially for Ki management
[3:59:39] <DSD24> Plus some weapones are built for stance switching constantly
[3:59:41] <+cheerfulnpc> @Kghaleon Yup, really changed the game for me when I was able to figure that out.
[3:59:51] <%HotSauceFiend> When I play axes, Its mostly high stance and mid stance for deflects. For swords, its high stance for Ki burst and Ki killing moves
[3:59:56] <VincentBrouillons> Low stance also has a WAY better dodge
[4:00:01] <@Lion_kun> I wish switching stances was just a button press, having to hold r1 and press a face button was a drag
[4:00:16] <DSD24> Oh
[4:00:16] <%Hamborgini> mimic-kun!
[4:00:20] <+Axellogic> he is frien
[4:00:23] <%Djinnazz> there he is!
[4:00:26] <+Axellogic> bring it on

[4:00:31] <%valriot> LUL
[4:00:31] <+bugz_munny> LUL
[4:00:31] <Kghaleon> passed it...lol
[4:00:32] <%Monkeyweed21> The real question is: Limitless or Beyond Infinity
[4:00:32] <+aWanderingKaivo> the great thing about it using R1 though is that it means stance switching is also a ki pulse
[4:00:32] <ferbeholds> bodied
[4:00:33] <%RayReborne> lol. lmao
[4:00:34] <Solidnick18> LUL
[4:00:34] <+HefestoForges> it was bring it on

[4:00:42] <+possumwalsh1221> LUL
[4:00:42] <rReizs> bring it on
[4:00:42] <+Axellogic> Its alway the 9 ones your menu is on by default
[4:00:43] <%HotSauceFiend> @Lion_kun absolutely. THats my only gripe is the switching. And accidently switching your guardian spirits mid fight
[4:00:43] <GunneryGoblin> took too long deciding emoted LUL
[4:00:44] <%SirGO0SE> he said "lol, lmao"
[4:00:45] <%MidnightBurst12> get bodied
[4:00:46] <CeJaxon> I actually used the High Stance dodge more than the low since it has more invincibility frames
[4:00:47] <%DashXero> They do not give you enough time for those.
[4:00:47] <President_valentine> Bodied by his huge sack
[4:00:48] <Solidnick18> Didn't do the gesture in time
[4:00:48] <fairore> wow pat
[4:00:50] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Gotta go fast
[4:00:51] <+cheerfulnpc> It will always be one of the ones in the first screen
[4:00:51] <%NopeBadguy> are you going to check out the ff5 pixel remaster now that it's out?
[4:00:52] <%HotSauceFiend> You played yourself
[4:00:53] <%epide> now that was a souls greeting
[4:00:56] <RushUnplugged> it's always one of the top 9
[4:00:56] <DSD24> @Monkeyweed21 Tough choice
[4:00:57] <youngking_kush> The Emote Mujina does is always on the page that pops up first
[4:00:59] <Kghaleon> Mimic said you weren't cool enough for his loot
[4:01:01] <@Lion_kun> @HotSauceFiend I hated when that happened lol
[4:01:03] <%Hamborgini> it always does emotes from the first page, so you don't need to hunt through everything you've unlocked
[4:01:03] <Solidnick18> LUL LUL
[4:01:04] <+charp35> bring it on
[4:01:05] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt damn dude, you fucking pissed-it-off HARD~!
[4:01:16] <Ferakin> Mujinas only imitate an emote in the 3x3 square you currently have up

[4:01:24] <%OthoZen> @PatStaresAt so Pat do you find this game clicks  with you more than nioh 1 ?
[4:01:49] <+aWanderingKaivo> the way this game integrates ki pulses into stance switching and moves like the iai moves for swords is really cool imo

[4:04:15] <amiavamp> there's a purple Pat over there
[4:04:15] <GhoulishCripple> @dakuu75 i think you have to kill it for a chance to get the yokai core
[4:04:15] <%HotSauceFiend> actually how do you swap which emotes go in the box? I never figured that out in game
[4:04:16] <%Hamborgini> @Dakuu75 you do. you can even get their soul cores that way
[4:04:17] <Kghaleon> TRAP
[4:04:18] <%valriot> PURPLE BABY
[4:04:18] <%Dakuu75> nega-kodama
[4:04:18] <sirrice77> drop items for little purple guys
[4:04:20] <zettig> drop an item on the ground
[4:04:20] <%AncelDeLambert> I just came back from making tea, you can whistle mimics open?
[4:04:21] <+aWanderingKaivo> the purple one is like the crows in dark souls
[4:04:23] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> no ki pulse?
[4:04:23] <+Axellogic> Purple Sudama like to be dropped items and give a random of he same type back
[4:04:23] <+ALazo> pum pu-rum
[4:04:26] <@Lion_kun> snuggly the crow

[4:04:39] <+possumwalsh1221> Friend :)
[4:04:41] <%Dakuu75> @GhoulishCripple @Hamborgini neat
[4:04:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> how that goblins hp doing?
[4:04:47] <DSD24> So cute
[4:04:51] <@GeneralSCPatton> Drop a purple, until you understand their language
[4:04:53] <+Axellogic> I use them for when I get a high level armor or weapon of a type I dont want
[4:04:54] <Solidnick18> aye ain't that nice
[4:04:55] <%AncelDeLambert> nothing that leans over like that wants anything wholesome
[4:05:00] <Kghaleon> Lantern plant fruit OhMyDog
[4:05:04] <%Monkeyweed21> Sparkly
[4:05:05] <+aWanderingKaivo> the goblin is slain and strung up as a warning to others at this point
[4:05:06] <@Lion_kun> you could give him a weapon or armor and he will give one back of equivalent rarity
[4:05:07] <+charp35> Drop a weapon you don't want
[4:05:10] <%valriot> LUL
[4:05:13] <Solidnick18> LUL
[4:05:13] <%SharkMissile> You can learn the demon language
[4:05:16] <%Hamborgini> you learn yokai language as the game goes on
[4:05:16] <@Lion_kun> purple means rarity
[4:05:16] <@GeneralSCPatton> They sometimes request specific things
[4:05:17] <DSD24> You can learn Yokai in this game Pat
[4:05:17] <%DashXero> Drop purple equipment until you can understand them.
[4:05:18] <+ThomasOfTroy> It means drop a purple
[4:05:19] <%shootbang_exe> ye
[4:05:19] <+McSoliace> give the purple kodama good shit
[4:05:20] <%DashXero> Yes.
[4:05:20] <+ALazo> if you give it equipment, it will return a different item of the same rarity
[4:05:20] <%RayReborne> Oh Purple quality Equipment lets you understand their language
[4:05:21] <%SharkMissile> Yeah!
[4:05:21] <%Agami23> they speak al-bhed
[4:05:21] <GhoulishCripple> @patstaresat the 2 different types of Sake you can find are the best items to drop. lots of consumables in reposnse
[4:05:21] <sirrice77> You can learn yokai, i'm not sure how it works
[4:05:22] <%Tragosavich> You learn demon language the further you go in the game
[4:05:23] <%RayReborne> neat
[4:05:24] <@Lion_kun> purple weapon or armor
[4:05:25] <rReizs> dont worry pat can read the gibberish
[4:05:25] <%Djinnazz> yep
[4:05:26] <Mahrota> That's how you learn it? I've never fed them high rarity items
[4:05:26] <@Lion_kun> yep
[4:05:26] <sonicblade38> @PatStaresAt yes but theres a trick to it
[4:05:28] <youngking_kush> You learn Yokai language over the course of the game yeah
[4:05:29] <%HotSauceFiend> Theres a system in this game where the more yokais you interact with the language is learned
[4:05:30] <%Dakuu75> someone is burning in the background lol
[4:05:30] <DSD24> Astral Knowledge I believe is what its called
[4:05:32] <+Axellogic> As your shiftling profienciency goes up you learn what yokai says
[4:05:33] <%JoshManVGH> By giving them purple gear it seems
[4:05:33] <+gfb537> You're half yokai.  You can learn the language. :)
[4:05:34] <GhoulishCripple> high shiftling level let's you learn yokai language
[4:05:34] <odnucaf3> "Lantern Plant Fruit" is like an "Ashen Estus Frask"
[4:05:36] <%Hamborgini> I think it's tied to your shiftling level
[4:05:37] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt  Later on, you can drop unpurified soul cores.
[4:05:51] <Solidnick18> yep
[4:05:56] <odnucaf3> The lenguage is called Youma.
[4:05:56] <DSD24> Rule of Cool
[4:06:14] <DeathByPoke7> I love how this game let's you style on enemies so hard
[4:06:17] <+sonofrobin73> It matches both item rarity and level, so drop the highest level and rarity weapon or armor you don't want
[4:06:24] <@GeneralSCPatton> Astral Wisdom scales with mission completion and core collection. It translates stuff and unlocks the later Shiftling skills.
[4:06:27] <%Dakuu75> "It's not about get good. It's about look good." -Max
[4:06:29] <Solidnick18> i love the follow ups

[4:08:47] <%Monkeyweed21> Yup
[4:08:47] <+aWanderingKaivo> probably yes
[4:08:47] <Solidnick18> dlc
[4:08:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> in fact I got a set from this level
[4:08:48] <%DashXero> No...?
[4:08:48] <%Bluwizard21> yes
[4:08:48] <+TheBitingIrish> Grats Pat, you found a tsukumogami
[4:08:49] <+HellCopter> Randomly
[4:08:49] <+McSoliace> maybe
[4:08:50] <twistedhands> there are yokai weapons for everything
[4:08:50] <DSD24> Maybe?
[4:08:51] <%HotSauceFiend> YOU CAN FORGE a Yokai Weapon
[4:08:51] <+Local16> You'll probably get a pair in the next story mission
[4:08:52] <sonicblade38> @PatStaresAt they soon
[4:08:52] <%CatastropheCorvid> Check the other stances for that weapon.
[4:08:52] <youngking_kush> Possibly
[4:08:53] <%SharkMissile> Maybe soon, maybe later
[4:08:53] <shiny_prinny> probably later on
[4:08:53] <Solidnick18> or soon
[4:08:56] <%Tragosavich> I got it the level after this I think?
[4:08:56] <%DashXero> I don't remember.
[4:08:56] <Solidnick18> idk
[4:08:56] <President_valentine> if it drops
[4:08:57] <IntrepidEye> most likely. RNG
[4:08:58] <tanarath> There's Yokai everything
[4:08:58] <%SirGO0SE> 20 minut :)
[4:08:59] <%SharkMissile> Pray to RNGesus
[4:09:00] <amiavamp> There are purity weapons too, they aren't as cool but they do let you ki pulse on block
[4:09:00] <sirrice77> they drop pretty early actually
[4:09:02] <%Dapper_Cactuar> @PatStaresAt there is at least 1 yokai weapon for every weapon type
[4:09:03] <twistedhands> probably not this early
[4:09:06] <+pectusumbra> @pectusumbra THank you, I completely blanked
[4:09:06] <kiyoso_kiyo> How long are you gonna play
[4:09:06] <yukichocomilk> this game does fuck
[4:09:06] <knight_verse> There's Yokai and Divine weapons Pat.
[4:09:07] <+possumwalsh1221> It’s RNG I believe
[4:09:07] <+rafaelba93> dont they just drop?
[4:09:08] <+Axellogic> ITs better nioh
[4:09:08] <Solidnick18> this game is GREAT
[4:09:09] <youngking_kush> Nioh 2 is RAD AF
[4:09:13] <%RayReborne> IT DOES FUCK PATRICK
[4:09:14] <Solidnick18> underrated
[4:09:18] <%Monkeyweed21> Next level or from this boss
[4:09:20] <+MisterAvry> you're weeb pyramid head
[4:09:20] <@Lion_kun> I can't wait for the next podcast.
[4:09:24] <%Djinnazz> yes they are, Purity is best for ki breaking
[4:09:24] <stormhawk9891> Although personally I prefer Divine weapons
[4:09:24] <youngking_kush> Purity weapons dont talk bro
[4:09:24] <%NopeBadguy> I never really gave Nioh 2 a chance
[4:09:28] <@GeneralSCPatton> Purity stomps yokai
[4:09:29] <+bravofifeniner> purity fists are god tier
[4:09:30] <Ferakin> Purify is also super good against yokai
[4:09:34] <GunneryGoblin> nioh 2 is my favorite soulslike
[4:09:34] <%Tragosavich> Level up the Yokai weapons
[4:09:35] <%Monkeyweed21> You ain’t seen SHIT
[4:09:35] <ArgentUndaCova> Corruption builds in this game is tight
[4:09:35] <RushUnplugged> they're both great, different uses
[4:09:35] <@Lion_kun> Pat is gonna gush about Nioh so much
[4:09:39] <twistedhands> purity weapons also do more ki damage to yokai
[4:09:40] <marsnbars> who needs purity when you can have Friends
[4:09:41] <%Tragosavich> They have a cool mechanic
[4:09:41] <TheProtomanBlues> luck based, got my tsuchigomo claws third mission
[4:09:42] <+aWanderingKaivo> yokai weapons are better vs humans, purity weapons are better vs yokai
[4:09:47] <+Axellogic> When your weapon glow purple strong attack do projectile beams
[4:09:47] <DSD24> I love the sheath for this weapon
[4:09:51] <GhoulishCripple> Yanaba Dual swords is my favorite living weapon. just granny's oversized fuck you knives
[4:09:53] <Solidnick18> That is the best for odachi
[4:09:58] <Solidnick18> the 1 2
[4:09:58] <%HotSauceFiend> Corruption weapons also apparently talk to you and gave me a minor mind goblin
[4:10:01] <kiyoso_kiyo> High stance odachi Kreygasm
[4:10:02] <TheMadBadger> @Axellogic Spoilers
[4:10:02] <+pectusumbra> I mean he threw an axe at you
[4:10:07] <%Agami23> its because it was a fire enchanted axe
[4:10:07] <%RayReborne> can't wait for next weeks podcast talking about Nioh 2 DESTROYING nioh 1 Kappa
[4:10:11] <Solidnick18> yeah
[4:10:14] <+Local16> Yeah that axe ability is strong as hell
[4:10:18] <@Lion_kun> Odachi is so much better in Nioh 2
[4:10:22] <+sonofrobin73> moonlit snow redux is better
[4:10:35] <%baka_sugoi> Goblin slain?
[4:10:36] <%Agami23> also, dont forget to use your tiger scrolls in order to unlock backstab
[4:10:36] <%NopeBadguy> Nioh 1 was really mediocre and I never tried 2 as a result
[4:10:38] <%Tragosavich> Once you have the skills for Odachi, you can do a crazy long cpombo switching stances till stamina runs out
[4:10:38] <youngking_kush> The vanity options in this game are top tier as well
[4:10:42] <%HotSauceFiend> Now you can naruto
[4:10:42] <Solidnick18> that's pretty good as well
[4:10:46] <%Monkeyweed21> Odachi also gets Stinger
[4:10:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> this is a very useful shortcut
[4:10:53] <%Dapper_Cactuar> caltrops rock in this game
[4:10:56] <%RayReborne> Spam Ninja tool, get Ninja Pointa
[4:10:56] <%SharkMissile> Consumables that refresh at shrines
[4:10:57] <stormhawk9891> Attunement basically
[4:10:59] <President_valentine> its just attument
[4:10:59] <+possumwalsh1221> Nioh 2 took all the good from 1 and fixed the bad
[4:11:00] <%epide> i love the poison bomb
[4:11:00] <+Rofiarf> they replenish similar to estus
[4:11:00] <odnucaf3> Same thing with TheSurge2, waaay better that 1
[4:11:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can craft firebombs and stuff
[4:11:07] <%HotSauceFiend> for now
[4:11:10] <%shootbang_exe> if I remember right doesn't this one basically give you ff14 glamour plates?
[4:11:16] <youngking_kush> @nopebadguy This is one of those sequels where the Devs actually listened to all complaints from the first game
[4:11:17] <+aWanderingKaivo> I like high heavy into mid into pommel strike for odachi, demolishes ki
[4:11:24] <%Monkeyweed21> Jutsu are respawning super consumables
[4:11:30] <%Hamborgini> I kind of wish the wind element was still a thing, even if it was really brutal to get hit with it
[4:11:37] <@GeneralSCPatton> All attacks should grant XP while using one of these buffs, so the tiger scroll can still let you grind.
[4:11:41] <Solidnick18> oh nice
[4:11:45] <+ALazo> more stambina indeed good
[4:11:54] <GhoulishCripple> @shootbang_exe yeah once you find an item you can basically glamour any other item of type to look like it
[4:11:57] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[4:12:08] <+Axellogic> the top of the shiftling tree is my favorite
[4:12:14] <+sonofrobin73> @shootbang_exe dunno what those are, but in this you have to pay to transmog each new piece of gear and you pick any armor you've found before
[4:12:15] <+Axellogic> tons of healing
[4:12:16] <%averyoddjew> averyoddjew subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! fun times ahead in raid town
[4:12:18] <%Monkeyweed21> Getting every stat to at least10 is always a good idea in early nioh
[4:12:21] <%Tragosavich> I remember in Nioh 1 I ran Axe for Yokai and Odachi for people
[4:12:22] <%RayReborne> passive effects for Weapon Skills
[4:12:27] <shiny_prinny> shiftling tree is mostly just stats
[4:12:30] <%HotSauceFiend> This game doesn't really require grinding at all now that I think about it
[4:12:39] <+aWanderingKaivo> and salt
[4:12:42] <%walternatorz> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[4:12:44] <GhoulishCripple> the right branch of the Yokai tree has some good "stamina in dark world" buffs
[4:12:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> nah this game is just good
[4:12:47] <Solidnick18> It is a good time
[4:12:52] <%HotSauceFiend> unless your aiming for specific armors, but the game can be cleared with low levels
[4:12:54] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You might get goblins when you hit the crafting, cause it did not change from the original
[4:12:56] <+Local16> Goblins defeated by having fun
[4:13:00] <zettig> your mind is all in your mind
[4:13:01] <DSD24> Nioh 2 is intimating at times but man is it worth it
[4:13:02] <%Tragosavich> So, real question.  Will you go back to NIoh 1 now after trying out Nioh 2?
[4:13:03] <CrimsonGargoyle> "I'm having a big huge blast." - PatBlastsAt
[4:13:03] <+rafaelba93> after 1 this is chill
[4:13:05] <+Axellogic> I  was always so sad you never got past Gozuki when you first played
[4:13:07] <%RayReborne> PAT THEY WERE TALKING, RUDE
[4:13:09] <+sonofrobin73> @HotSauceFiend Not unless you want a specific smithing text or boss skill and you're very unlucky
[4:13:10] <shiny_prinny> i love when the enemies are staring at the kodamas
[4:13:13] <amiavamp> Odachi combos are going to cause some goblins as well
[4:13:15] <+aWanderingKaivo> fortunately crafting is not needed on ng
[4:13:19] <%DashXero> Crafting is still intense.
[4:13:22] <+HellCopter> The crafting is kinda not important
[4:13:22] <Kghaleon> Crafting is New game+ anywy
[4:13:23] <%Monkeyweed21> The shifting tree also lets you get through dark realms easier
[4:13:24] <youngking_kush> I never crafted anything in this game
[4:13:25] <odnucaf3> I'm so happy you are having fun :D
[4:13:29] <%kknutson4> I beat the game and never bothered crafting anything.
[4:13:29] <DSD24> You get good shit just from loot drops
[4:13:32] <President_valentine> Even enemies know they're adorable
[4:13:33] <theshillman> im glad you're giving ninjutsus a shot, they have some great stuff
[4:13:45] <Solidnick18> i just used the soul fusion thing
[4:13:45] <%Hamborgini> crafting isn't really worth it until NG+ in this anyway, so you can ignore that for a good long time
[4:13:49] <%kknutson4> Just farmed revenants who had crafted sets
[4:13:53] <+Axellogic> youll get it again eventually
[4:13:54] <DSD24> You can get it soon
[4:13:55] <Zombrocom> Don't worry, it's still there
[4:13:58] <%SharkMissile> I'm like 80% sure it's in the skill grid there somewhere
[4:14:00] <rReizs> crafting is just reduce everything you have and turn them into the highest tier of materials so you can gamble on crafts
[4:14:00] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt That's still there, just later in the tree
[4:14:02] <amiavamp> You can OTG using low stance heavy attacks
[4:14:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> Try your other stances too
[4:14:03] <Shwepie> Crafting was intense, right away, and didn't actually matter until NG+ because you could generally find better weapons easier.
[4:14:07] <+aWanderingKaivo> I crafted on ng but not to try for certain stats, just to get low stat required items with higher def and attk as I lvled
[4:14:10] <artoflec> LUL
[4:14:14] <%RayReborne> omg that DOES suck
[4:14:15] <%Tragosavich> It gets longer with higher ninjutsu
[4:14:16] <@GeneralSCPatton> Scales with Ninjutsu Power
[4:14:16] <+rafaelba93> kinda
[4:14:16] <+Axellogic> it scales with your ninjutsu stat
[4:14:18] <%RayReborne> never used it lol
[4:14:19] <%Dapper_Cactuar> duration can be upgraded I think
[4:14:19] <%Djinnazz> gotta lvl it to last longer
[4:14:19] <shiny_prinny> its scales with dex level
[4:14:20] <+HellCopter> It gets better as your ninjutsu increases
[4:14:20] <RushUnplugged> that's because you're not big skilled yet
[4:14:21] <%NopeBadguy> tigers don't run for very long
[4:14:23] <%CatastropheCorvid> Gets better as you level Ninjjutso
[4:14:23] <@Lion_kun> I disagree. I crafted health regen armor and was unkillable.
[4:14:23] <kiyoso_kiyo> Just finished the end game content and I crafted less than 100 times
[4:14:23] <Solidnick18> i think you gotta upgrade it
[4:14:25] <TurtlesAndTentacles> my booster is kicking my ass guys
[4:14:25] <shiny_prinny> but that still sucks
[4:14:27] <%HotSauceFiend> If you level nijitsu the effects last longer
[4:14:27] <youngking_kush> Tiger Running Scrolls do suck yes lol
[4:14:32] <+sonofrobin73> It's really only there to help you run past everything
[4:14:35] <%Paperware> Get quick change for ninjitsu ASAP
[4:14:37] <CrimsonGargoyle> i recommend getting aquainted with crafting early on because by the time you reach ng+ there's gonna be 12 other systems on top of it lmao
[4:14:37] <%averyoddjew> the correct answer for this game is onmyo magic
[4:14:37] <%IamGrapes> have better ninja stat, then it'll be better
[4:14:39] <%RayReborne> oh, bigger jutsu, longer Run
[4:14:44] <@Lion_kun> Literally one shotted every boss
[4:14:45] <%Monkeyweed21> It scales with ninjutsu level
[4:14:47] <theshillman> just wait until you get quick-change, that shit rules
[4:14:48] <@GeneralSCPatton> Just smack dudes while the scroll is up and you'll have more skill points in no time.
[4:14:52] <Solidnick18> quick change scroll is the shit
[4:14:53] <%Blank9> yeah never need to craft much even if you want to minmax
[4:14:57] <+aWanderingKaivo> he probably won't do ng+ tbh
[4:15:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> big lehvul
[4:15:05] <%slrls_> the odachi shoulder scoot move is hilarious
[4:15:08] <%Blank9> I just snatched weapons and armor from ghosts and then rerolled skills on them
[4:15:10] <+Axellogic> I mean its the same move but eh
[4:15:15] <youngking_kush> Ninjutsu is better for Elementals, Onmyo is better for buffs
[4:15:20] <+rafaelba93> use tiger it to lvl ninjutso and thats it
[4:15:21] <kiyoso_kiyo> Soul matching is another story, I do that stuff like 20 times a day
[4:15:23] <DSD24> Nice Ronin gear
[4:15:28] <%RayReborne> yet
[4:15:29] <%HotSauceFiend> Its impossible
[4:15:29] <%Issun135> bruh bows are good in this. shit i might have to buy nioh 2 for christmas.
[4:15:32] <odnucaf3> Mimics have 3 bars on their chests.
[4:15:36] <%Hamborgini> ssseeecrets
[4:15:37] <%NopeBadguy> tigers can only run at max speed in short bursts so it makes sense Kappa
[4:15:41] <%Blank9> the best odachi move is the one where you slam into them and roll over them, 100%
[4:15:43] <%Djinnazz> most of your craft mats would be use on changing atributes.
[4:15:48] <+aWanderingKaivo> yokai weapons are cool for soul matching, just shove soul cores into them to level them up
[4:15:48] <@Lion_kun> If you use the crafting system, you can make a really busted build.
[4:15:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> welcome to fire
[4:15:55] <%Blank9> it grapples everything even without being out of stamina
[4:15:55] <CrimsonGargoyle> @Issun135 Bows be Bussin, they can get real wild
[4:15:56] <%BigCoffee> So what's the story in this?
[4:15:59] <stormhawk9891> Ye
[4:16:00] <%RayReborne> yee
[4:16:00] <%Tragosavich> Its a random drop
[4:16:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yep
[4:16:01] <President_valentine> It is
[4:16:03] <+Axellogic> IT was a random drop yes
[4:16:04] <+pectusumbra> "You could hardly even call it a sword"
[4:16:05] <youngking_kush> Yup
[4:16:05] <@GeneralSCPatton> @Blank9 I prefer to corner-fuck dudes with the shoulder ram
[4:16:05] <artoflec> SONIC rbeePOG
[4:16:09] <%SharkMissile> Yeah the visual weapon variety in this game is really great
[4:16:11] <Solidnick18> what is the rarity?
[4:16:11] <+rafaelba93> what story?
[4:16:11] <olm46> It's Sonic!
[4:16:12] <%Tragosavich> You get other cool demon weapons randomly
[4:16:12] <%Hamborgini> you got the ippon datara odachi from an ippon datara
[4:16:15] <Zombrocom> Most things are
[4:16:17] <ferbeholds> cooked
[4:16:19] <youngking_kush> Pat this is Diablo-Ninja-Souls
[4:16:20] <GunneryGoblin> random, but not particularly rare i dont think
[4:16:24] <+HellCopter> @BigCoffee Nothing yet, but it's about Hideyoshi (but fantasy)
[4:16:24] <%SirGO0SE> @Blank9 thats hot
[4:16:30] <DSD24> @BigCoffee You play as a Half Yokai named Hide who's living their life as a mercenary
[4:16:33] <GhoulishCripple> thronecrusher Cannon is my favorite ranged weapon, I can't wait for pat to find one
[4:16:34] <knight_verse> its a powerful piece of garbage.
[4:16:35] <odnucaf3> That door is the Boss.
[4:16:38] <%RayReborne> nope
[4:16:43] <Parapattern> Sim-burai
[4:16:44] <+Axellogic> you only have dodge ki pulse for mid stance
[4:16:46] <+pectusumbra> what's the top left?
[4:16:52] <+sonofrobin73> go for moonlit snow redux
[4:17:02] <DSD24> @BigCoffee There is character creation but your canon name is Hide
[4:17:04] <+aWanderingKaivo> the pommel strike on odachi is pretty solid too for ki destruction
[4:17:14] <kiyoso_kiyo> moonlit snow op
[4:17:14] <youngking_kush> Dodge Ki Pulse is a must ASA0
[4:17:18] <%Monkeyweed21> Get stinger
[4:17:19] <Solidnick18> that's good
[4:17:22] <youngking_kush> ASAP*
[4:17:24] <+Axellogic> Charging bull is great but you cant learn it yet
[4:17:27] <stormhawk9891> Yo Charging BUll FUCKS
[4:17:32] <%Blank9> charging bull is the best but yeah
[4:17:35] <%Blank9> later
[4:17:43] <+Axellogic> Its high damage but slow
[4:17:45] <%SharkMissile> It's very situational
[4:17:45] <+aWanderingKaivo> you can use it when you would ki pulse
[4:17:48] <V0LK__> imperative strike is VERY SITUATIONAL
[4:17:50] <%RayReborne> i dont use the sheath skills that much
[4:17:51] <+sonofrobin73> Its okay
[4:17:51] <GhoulishCripple> it's good for a sneak attack substitute for now
[4:17:53] <+pectusumbra> it's the starter right?
[4:17:53] <Zombrocom> It's ok when you get the ability to use it quickly during a ki pulse
[4:17:54] <+McSoliace> you can sheathe your sword mid combo
[4:17:54] <President_valentine> big damage
[4:17:55] <+aWanderingKaivo> you press R1 when you do it so it ki pulses
[4:17:55] <+Axellogic> ITs great for when you down an enemy and they are recovering
[4:17:57] <toahmes> It's best for sneak attacks
[4:17:58] <RushUnplugged> stealthy BIG damage
[4:17:58] <%Tragosavich> Its meh
[4:18:00] <TsunTsuchinoko> It's big damage on an opening
[4:18:01] <%Blank9> imperative strike is good, you'll auto-sheathe with the button input
[4:18:01] <GhoulishCripple> and later upgrades speed it up
[4:18:02] <+HellCopter> It's good for range/starter
[4:18:02] <@GeneralSCPatton> It's kind of ok for first contact when they are running up to you
[4:18:03] <youngking_kush> Use it on a downed enemy
[4:18:03] <CrimsonGargoyle> it's purpose is to unlock the further skills along that part of the tree @PatStaresAt
[4:18:05] <+Axellogic> just hold the sheathe button to auto do it
[4:18:09] <%Hamborgini> it's good in combination with stuff from the shiftling tree, also
[4:18:09] <%averyoddjew> it's a skill tax to get batter stuff
[4:18:09] <RushUnplugged> sneak up on people and do a big opener
[4:18:11] <%HotSauceFiend> You can time the release of the draw
[4:18:13] <%Blank9> it's just a big charge attack basically
[4:18:13] <%AgniBrandt> You can hold the button WHILE sheathing it to start the charge
[4:18:20] <+sonofrobin73> You can ki pulse into sheathe, but if you hold sheathe button you'll do imperative strike
[4:18:21] <kiyoso_kiyo> Moonlit snow redux is the best move for odachi
[4:18:26] <youngking_kush> Drain enemy ki, then use that for BIG damage
[4:18:32] <%RyTYoung> @patstaresat do you think you'll check out the new Blasphemous DLC?
[4:18:36] <%Blank9> r1+circle is the sheathe command automatically
[4:18:40] <Solidnick18> Alot of skills in this game
[4:18:42] <+aWanderingKaivo> so it can be used as a finisher its rad
[4:18:43] <%AgniBrandt> Yeah the Iai style moves are good
[4:18:44] <+charp35> you just hold r1 O at any point
[4:18:44] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You cannot activate every skill there is a cap
[4:18:44] <DSD24> Its super good actually
[4:18:45] <+MisterAvry> oh that's cool
[4:18:46] <%Bt_Robot> Yeah this is a sphere grid, after all
[4:18:46] <%RayReborne> you can Coins to Reset skills anyway
[4:18:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> big combo
[4:18:48] <Ferakin> Odachi is secretly a stance switching combo machine
[4:18:48] <Solidnick18> like ALOT of skills
[4:18:49] <CrimsonGargoyle> YE YE YE csbeastYeyeye
[4:18:54] <+HellCopter> Only if you can really read the enemy
[4:18:54] <Questiy> There are stats that build into it that makes it stupidly powerful
[4:18:54] <%averyoddjew> it's not that bad
[4:18:55] <nobunaga1221> the iai slash is great on katana but it is okayish on odachi
[4:18:59] <youngking_kush> There no useless moves in this game lol
[4:19:00] <@GeneralSCPatton> Pat's enjoyment of this gives me life
[4:19:02] <%NopeBadguy> are you doing a fucking spirit roundslash with a greatsword @PatStaresAt
[4:19:06] <%averyoddjew> it's really hard to use tho, but the payoff is good
[4:19:07] <+aWanderingKaivo> the dual sword and katana iai moves are better but the odachi one is still nice to have
[4:19:08] <+Axellogic> press strong attack pat
[4:19:10] <%Djinnazz> weapons awake!
[4:19:12] <+HellCopter> Attack with it
[4:19:13] <%Hamborgini> do strong attacks
[4:19:13] <Zombrocom> Your weapon is now awake
[4:19:15] <%SharkMissile> Oh this is good
[4:19:15] <stormhawk9891> You don't
[4:19:15] <amiavamp> Odachi gets a more useful chargeup with more range later
[4:19:15] <+aWanderingKaivo> that's a buff
[4:19:17] <%Djinnazz> you fon't
[4:19:18] <DSD24> You don't
[4:19:18] <+Axellogic> it will auto drain no matter wat
[4:19:19] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt do strong attack while purp
[4:19:20] <Solidnick18> No do the strong
[4:19:20] <%RayReborne> SWAP
[4:19:21] <%Tragosavich> You cant
[4:19:22] <%NopeBadguy> weapon is WOKE
[4:19:22] <%SharkMissile> It means it's now betterer
[4:19:22] <youngking_kush> THATS YOUR BANKAI
[4:19:24] <+HellCopter> You can't lol. Do a strong attack
[4:19:24] <TheMadBadger> Gotta kill
[4:19:24] <CrimsonGargoyle> weapon WOKE
[4:19:25] <%RayReborne> switch weapons
[4:19:25] <@GeneralSCPatton> You can't, that's the sentience buff
[4:19:27] <GhoulishCripple> Dual swords "sign of the cross" is the same but you do a cross slash and its great
[4:19:30] <%Blank9> it's good on downed enemies as a huge hit
[4:19:31] <+Axellogic> use strong attack to do beams
[4:19:33] <+pectusumbra> so yeah, either use that move to start a fight or to end it
[4:19:33] <Shadope342> yokai weapons do that
[4:19:33] <sonicblade38> @PatStaresAt when yokai weps kill enogh they go SSJ automaticly
[4:19:35] <Solidnick18> yep
[4:19:35] <GhoulishCripple> swap weapons
[4:19:36] <%JoshManVGH> Purple is Trance from FF9
[4:19:37] <%Hamborgini> you're a zelda now
[4:19:42] <Solidnick18> that's what that does
[4:19:42] <+Axellogic> itll fill back up
[4:19:46] <CrimsonGargoyle> is just a buff
[4:19:47] <%AgniBrandt> Sadly, once a weapon awakens the meter keeps draining until its gone. If you could control it they'd be massively overpowered
[4:19:48] <amiavamp> yes
[4:19:49] <%SharkMissile> I don't think so
[4:19:50] <+charp35> You can't
[4:19:51] <youngking_kush> Yes
[4:19:51] <GhoulishCripple> it pauses it
[4:19:54] <+HellCopter> nah it would drain immediately
[4:20:05] <+Axellogic> youd have to fil it back up again either way
[4:20:06] <%RayReborne> you can wait till the bar is mostly full then save it for a tough enemy by using your other weapon
[4:20:11] <@GeneralSCPatton> Some players will swap right before the purple is charged up to save it for bosses
[4:20:16] <%SirGO0SE> the duality of chat
[4:20:17] <+aWanderingKaivo> the thing that sucks with yokai weapons is that the awakening will cancel any other weapon buff you have active
[4:20:18] <President_valentine> You could get it almost full then switch to it during a boss
[4:20:22] <+aWanderingKaivo> and you can't control it
[4:20:25] <%RayReborne> Swapping while active removes it
[4:20:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> this is the fuck house
[4:20:31] <CrimsonGargoyle> fuckai zone
[4:20:34] <youngking_kush> I use an endgame Corruption build guys, it definitely goes away when you switch
[4:21:05] <%JoshManVGH> I'm glad Pat likes this cause now we may get to hear the trademarked line "So, I ground a little off stream."
[4:21:08] <DXLelouch24> Once the meters full it activates
[4:21:14] <%AgniBrandt> Can confirm, switching weapons removes awakening
[4:21:25] <%JoshManVGH> And in this game that's totally justified!
[4:21:26] <thefrogman951> If you use another element to buff the weapon it will only take away about 1/4 of the bar and stop it from draining further
[4:21:33] <Zombrocom> It pauses if you swiyvh before awakening, it ends early if you switch during awakening
[4:21:38] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> look at the graves
[4:21:38] <ferbeholds> check the grave
[4:21:39] <+MisterAvry> eeek
[4:21:39] <+aWanderingKaivo> check the revenant
[4:21:39] <kiyoso_kiyo> how many attempts do you think he’s gonna take to kill the boss chat
[4:21:40] <youngking_kush> Emote
[4:21:40] <artoflec> check the graves near them
[4:21:41] <%OthoZen> emote

[4:22:40] <sirrice77> @DashXero yeah correct emote type or somehow getting behind them avoids fighting

[4:23:11] <%averyoddjew> NUTS
[4:23:12] <%DashXero> @JoshManVGH Thanks.
[4:23:12] <GhoulishCripple> best souls game feature
[4:23:13] <%Valdorick> Pausing, in my souls game? Its more likely than you think.
[4:23:13] <Shadope342> miyazaki writing FURIOUSLY in his notes
[4:23:14] <+possumwalsh1221> Adding a pause was a god tier addition
[4:23:16] <mr_catsup> btw you can whistle to make the mimic chests come out
[4:23:27] <%JoshManVGH> Pause! Who new that was a good thing!
[4:23:28] <%Hamborgini> I love how many kinds of mimic this game has
[4:23:30] <%DashXero> There's a PAUSE BUTTON?!
[4:23:35] <shiny_prinny> you could pause in Nioh 1 too
[4:23:38] <GhoulishCripple> how do you whistle
[4:23:38] <%RayReborne> lol
[4:23:43] <%JoshManVGH> @mr_catsup Are you serious!?
[4:23:43] <GhoulishCripple> is it an emofe
[4:23:49] <+Ell1ot> does easy mode add a pause button?
[4:23:51] <mr_catsup> yap
[4:23:59] <sirrice77> whistle is emote yes
[4:23:59] <shiny_prinny> whistle is a yellow emote
[4:24:12] <%RayReborne> aight later Chat, gotta sleep for work Sadge
[4:24:16] <%JoshManVGH> @ell1ot Always a pause button.
[4:24:18] <%Bt_Robot> Pause was in the original, right?
[4:24:27] <GhoulishCripple> yeah
[4:24:27] <%JoshManVGH> It was
[4:24:29] <mr_catsup> ye
[4:24:48] <%Bt_Robot> So he just got that old man brain.
[4:25:04] <kiyoso_kiyo> He kills enenra in 3 tries I’m calling it now
[4:25:26] <%JoshManVGH> I don't think he needed to pause when he did the Niho 1 stream.
[4:26:41] <GhoulishCripple> I haven't checked any of the nioh 2 dlc out because im a ps4 player. but damn I need the fist weapon. if I'm only buying 2 which other one should I get besides dark in the capital
[4:27:36] <kiyoso_kiyo> aren’t all the dlcs free ?
[4:27:59] <shiny_prinny> not on ps4, but you can always try to wait for a sale
[4:28:13] <%JoshManVGH> @ghoulishcripple You want Darkness in the Capital then, that adds the first weapon.
[4:28:35] <GhoulishCripple> any others that are equally useful to have?
[4:28:35] <%JoshManVGH> otherwise if you can swing the extra 10 I think the season pass comes with all 3.
[4:28:40] <kiyoso_kiyo> I’m on ps4, guess I bought them and didn’t know lol
[4:29:08] <%SharkMissile> Man I love this song
[4:29:15] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[4:29:23] <shiny_prinny> The First Samurai has cool enemies, so that's my vote for a 2nd dlc
[4:29:24] <GhoulishCripple> might buy the pass. I just reached act 3 and am loving my dual swords Switchglaive build
[4:31:13] <+Axellogic> Dual Swords and Switchglaive are so crazy popular
[4:31:41] <Zombrocom> Everyone I see start this game uses the fists
[4:31:44] <GhoulishCripple> I think it's the ninja Gaiden feel
[4:31:47] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Where did Pat say he was going?
[4:32:00] <GhoulishCripple> da Baby needed potty
[4:32:03] <amiavamp> Almost every streamer I've seen play this has done unga bunga axe high stance
[4:32:08] <akitanito> poo
[4:32:29] <+Axellogic> unga axe is cool tho
[4:32:29] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:32:29] <%KnifeyMcEdge> oh no
[4:32:30] <%NopeBadguy> unga bunga mid nodachi
[4:32:30] <akitanito> Fist is cool
[4:32:36] <%JoshManVGH> Pat FISTS!
[4:32:38] <DSD24> I like being Omnyo Mage lady
[4:32:42] <%DashXero> Fists ARE cool.
[4:32:43] <akitanito> patfistsat
[4:32:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's your good friend, monke
[4:32:49] <youngking_kush> Fists are sooo fucking good
[4:32:56] <GhoulishCripple> my very first attempt at Nioh2 was hatchets and Dual swords. this was when the game launched, but I never beat it and lost the save file
[4:32:57] <DSD24> Break that horn
[4:33:03] <%vVAstrAVv> no switchglaive and splitstaff are cool lol fists too
[4:33:04] <%Blank9> everyone loves fists
[4:33:04] <GunneryGoblin> next time i play im transitioning my build from Fist/Sword to Fist/Kusurigama
[4:33:05] <%DashXero> You wanna know  how many streamers play Souls-likes with fist weapons? Close to zero.
[4:33:05] <bxdragon> Cool kids use tonfa
[4:33:07] <+Axellogic> ANy weapon you use is cool Id only be dissapointed if it was just dual swords
[4:33:09] <%JoshManVGH> Mage seems cool with the glaive, I have yet to comprehend the staff.
[4:33:28] <GhoulishCripple> Hatchets are wild fo me. so many projectile attacks
[4:33:30] <+Axellogic> Splitstaff feels super good
[4:33:40] <%Djinnazz> water barrel
[4:33:41] <sirrice77> walked past bucket
[4:33:42] <kiyoso_kiyo> @axellogic why the dual sword hate
[4:33:44] <GunneryGoblin> glaive and staff seem super rad
[4:33:48] <%Blank9> yeah hatchets are crazy unique
[4:33:50] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt kick the barrel back there
[4:33:52] <+aWanderingKaivo> dual swords are great though
[4:33:54] <%JoshManVGH> Is that just the fish dudes sword for Borutos Dads anime?
[4:33:58] <President_valentine> Every weapon feels super good
[4:34:07] <GhoulishCripple> the Spinning hatchets
[4:34:16] <+Axellogic> @kiyoso_kiyo Not dual sword hate its just constantly seeing it with everyone I play with or watch and every revenant
[4:34:17] <youngking_kush> I believe you need to make it to the basement of this building
[4:34:17] <GhoulishCripple> literally pins enemies in place
[4:34:28] <+aWanderingKaivo> that's fair
[4:34:32] <%baka_sugoi> P O O P

[4:35:52] <%JoshManVGH> Texas Ranger?
[4:35:52] <Mr_Rakjo> Paige is made of glass ofc she needs a waker every now and then
[4:35:58] <youngking_kush> I thought we all knew Paige was fragile
[4:35:59] <@PeachSaliva> For when Pat hits the back
[4:36:02] <knight_verse> Paiges walker?
[4:36:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Back backs suck yo
[4:36:10] <olm46> Paige is secretly 50 years old

[4:36:41] <TurtlesAndTentacles> lol damn Paige
[4:36:42] <Kghaleon> HahaDoge
[4:36:43] <%MidnightPacif1c> psaDogchamp
[4:36:43] <GhoulishCripple> I know I said it earlier but. I really love the soul counter glowing when you have a level. I hope elden ring steals that
[4:36:45] <Huntercd> Quit blowing her back out Pat
[4:36:45] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Do you have a cool cane?
[4:36:48] <%SaiyanShoto> Oh my god Paige LUL LUL LUL
[4:36:49] <akitanito> it's an improvised weapon
[4:36:50] <knight_verse> Just get a wheelchair like a proper lazy person would.
[4:36:52] <GhoulishCripple> makes me know how big a gamble I am making
[4:36:56] <%Dakuu75> I always forget how actualy-fucked Paige is because she's always so cheery in her streams
[4:36:57] <ahmz1404> Paige is definitely an angry cane lady
[4:37:00] <akitanito> one pip
[4:37:02] <%Agami23> that makes sense considering how bad her back stuff was. glad she didnt get full wheelchair issues
[4:37:04] <%maskofmichael> @JoshManVGH Canes can hide a sword
[4:37:15] <%SaiyanShoto> Paige should have a pimp cane with a sword in it
[4:37:15] <akitanito> good dodge
[4:37:17] <@GeneralSCPatton> The counter will cancel you out of that zero ki stun state
[4:37:19] <%vVAstrAVv> is pat not using his soul cores?
[4:37:21] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Cane swords are dope
[4:37:24] <%NopeBadguy> he chew
[4:37:26] <+inuyashard> i love big daddy kane
[4:37:28] <youngking_kush> @maskofmichael Canes can hide a shotgun
[4:37:28] <amiavamp> A fan ran up to pat and tried to hug him LUL
[4:37:35] <knight_verse> Grandma Paige
[4:37:46] <%SirGO0SE> @SaiyanShoto SHOULD SHE? Really?!
[4:37:46] <%Agami23> pat literally used a spirit core like 10 seconds ago
[4:37:46] <%KnifeyMcEdge> cane sword, cane chain whip, cane gun, you name it
[4:37:52] <Huntercd> Gief bitterClap plagueTaps
[4:37:57] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Paige is one day going to use those claw things to reach things slightly far away.

[4:46:43] <%AgniBrandt> I can't wait until Pat gets the SUPER FLURRY
[4:46:53] <MuFuzzy649> dempshy roll
[4:46:53] <+TopTieramisu> it's not a true dempsey roll without the jet plane noise
[4:46:54] <+bloodrune8864> If only you’d used the new shrine you unlocked
[4:46:56] <SinisterBroccoli> Is there a mod to add jet noises to the dempsey roll?
[4:46:57] <artoflec> i guess its an area load yeah, pc version of nioh 1 kinda had that
[4:46:58] <DanThePumpkinman> wait, fists is just wolverine mode now? sick
[4:47:05] <+Axellogic> If you get performance bottlenecks it slows the game down before it drops frames
[4:47:22] <GhoulishCripple> if you have a summoner's candle you can get your souls back for free
[4:47:31] <+bloodrune8864> It depends on the fists
[4:47:35] <GhoulishCripple> well for popping the consumable
[4:47:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> a rock solid 23 frames
[4:47:40] <+aramus123> @sinisterbroccoli maybe mod for EVERYTHING
[4:47:41] <@Ranryu692> aw yeah, just finished my first glowy endgame weapon in XIV. the Lux Anima weapons look sick
[4:47:41] <GhoulishCripple> but you get a lot of them
[4:47:43] <RushUnplugged> I saw at least 7 frames, I swear
[4:47:47] <ahmz1404> I doubt your PC has to load, I had no problems and i'm mid-range
[4:47:57] <GhoulishCripple> you can level up pat
[4:47:58] <youngking_kush> Summoner's Candles are the shit
[4:48:00] <+bluestbee> Yeah monkey fucking RESPAWNS
[4:48:09] <youngking_kush> I often wish I had them in Dark Souls
[4:48:11] <+pectusumbra> oh, you drop your soul cores with your souls, that's nice
[4:48:12] <+aramus123> @youngking_kush PREACH
[4:48:16] <%vVAstrAVv> you have enough for a level up btw
[4:48:20] <SinisterBroccoli> @Ranryu692 Yeah I've been wanting that paladin weapon for years
[4:48:21] <+aWanderingKaivo> water talisman from the omnyo tree would be perfect for this boss fight
[4:48:22] <+D00msDayDan> no bread, only cheese
[4:48:25] <Shiibbae> good damage control
[4:48:27] <+Axellogic> I know I get slowdowns runnning the game at 4k 120 if im running the stream as well
[4:48:30] <Shadope342> saved(?)
[4:48:32] <+Axellogic> im on a 3080
[4:48:34] <V0LK__> MOST of the time LUL
[4:48:38] <knight_verse> I can see why every single build guide for this game says that the punch weapons are broken beyond belief.... holy shit do they easily they trivialize those enemies.
[4:48:40] <nesbitt22> Pat Get that Bread Yo
[4:48:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> you can't trust someone who smells good ALL the time
[4:48:42] <akitanito> did pat jump into the pit he opened in the building?
[4:48:44] <+TopTieramisu> he meant buried
[4:48:46] <+tempestzephyr> most of the time lol
[4:48:57] <cricket42069> gotta be realistic about smells..
[4:49:03] <GhoulishCripple> summoner's candles the best item. legit nioh 2 Is the first non from souls game to really add to the genre with items and Mechanics
[4:49:20] <amiavamp> Nope it's windowed fullscreen
[4:49:31] <amiavamp> There is an option to make it normal fullscreen (but it crashes for me)
[4:49:32] <+TopTieramisu> did you?
[4:49:37] <+aramus123> too soon pat
[4:49:37] <shiny_prinny> jumping hitbox
[4:49:39] <ahmz1404> it's not fullscreen and it's super annoying because it stretches on a 16:10 monitor
[4:49:39] <youngking_kush> @ghoulishcripple Legit. Nioh 2 does a few things better than Souls IMO too

[4:49:48] <akitanito> hit him better
[4:49:59] <RushUnplugged> @knight_verse fists and tonfas are among the best weapons for endgame because it's the simplest way to nuke enemies' Ki bar. every weapon is viable but some are quite busted
[4:50:05] <%CalderGaming> tactical crazy talk

[4:51:24] <%notsoy> no, but i cannot share in it because i am lactose intolerant
[4:51:24] <senfood> I mean, I like cheese on some stuff but I can never eat just cheese, by itself.

[4:51:31] <%LordSDB> Everyone likes cheese tho
[4:51:31] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Black people love cheese, but lactose intolerance is far more prevelant outside of european decent
[4:51:32] <bxdragon> No
[4:51:33] <%athuramn> I'm baffled by their salt and vinegar chips obsession
[4:51:34] <+McSoliace> nah cheese fucks

[4:51:35] <%captain_thickthighs> I'm just wonder why they always have it at every event
[4:51:35] <%Ebonyglow> im mexican... nah it aint weird
[4:51:36] <+D00msDayDan> i was gonna answer because i'm half not white but man i LOVE cheese
[4:51:36] <%slrls_> If Quebec has inherited the French cheese traditions, no. Sounds great.
[4:51:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> I'm white and I dislike cheese
[4:51:36] <vandastelka> not really
[4:51:37] <Shiibbae> CHEESE IMPLIES MONEY
[4:51:38] <Manwad> cows i guess
[4:51:40] <+aWanderingKaivo> oh no
[4:51:41] <@goose_attack_almanac> our European roots poisoned us
[4:51:41] <Mister_McDerp> lactose intolerance most likely
[4:51:42] <%LordSDB> I'm so confused by this
[4:51:43] <%SuckerPunchSyd> It 100% is
[4:51:46] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I like cheese but not to that extent
[4:51:47] <JayCantDo> @PatStaresAt I only found out that it was a thing threw the boondocks i just thought i Loved cheese
[4:51:48] <IntrepidEye> I love cheese but just eating a whole plate of just cheese is weird to me
[4:51:51] <youngking_kush> Cheese n Crackers lmao
[4:51:52] <%captain_thickthighs> it seems white people have the ability to spawn cheese at any possible event
[4:51:53] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt white people have lower rates of lactose intolerance.
[4:51:56] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige you forgot slavery
[4:51:57] <+Plus_On_Black> Why they love cheese tho?
[4:52:00] <%NitronStreams> I enjoy a cheese every once in a while. I mean mozzarella is pretty good.
[4:52:01] <@GeneralSCPatton> We won the genetic lottery with lactase persistance
[4:52:07] <rReizs> dont worry, other cultures have cultured foods as well
[4:52:08] <akitanito> oh right, lactose intolerance is a big thing is asia
[4:52:10] <%notsoy> paige forgot colonization
[4:52:12] <%maskofmichael> What about Mayo?
[4:52:13] <youngking_kush> & Colonialism lmao
[4:52:15] <%KetsuoTaberu> genetic inevitability
[4:52:22] <%Tragosavich> Have you ever wondered the first guy to make cheese? Like did they just left out milk for a long time or something?
[4:52:25] <Mister_McDerp> biologically predetermined LUL
[4:52:25] <%brisk_dacat> Yeah taking a good cheese shit when ya lactose is amazing
[4:52:26] <%I_chose_Rapture> I_chose_Rapture subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 36 months! finally a day off to catch a livestream!
[4:52:27] <%Bt_Robot> When chese is good enough, it can have no lactose
[4:52:31] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @youngking_kush Right! lol
[4:52:32] <+TopTieramisu> wtf pat
[4:52:34] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Shredded cheese is a stable diet of any American teenager.
[4:52:34] <+swid_harry> secret bloodline technique
[4:52:37] <%KnifeyMcEdge> ????
[4:52:38] <GhoulishCripple> @patstaresat you'll see a bunch of levels where human camps and yokai zones exist intercepting each other. and it's kinda cool because they will fight if they run into each other and there is a handful of levels where different paths make you face one or the other. it's cool
[4:52:39] <%Broand> yo theres a shrine there
[4:52:41] <+TopTieramisu> does pat also dislike mangoes?
[4:52:41] <%SirGO0SE> @Tragosavich all the time tbh
[4:52:46] <Shwepie> The reality is we evolved lactose tolerance and that was long enough ago that we evolved a pallet for cheese since then.
[4:52:48] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Whaaaat
[4:52:51] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I met people during a party last saturday that had never had cheese (like real cheese they had had kraft macaroni and kraft singles) They understood immediately why people loved cheese
[4:52:53] <%KnifeyMcEdge> STRAWBERRIES are pretty good
[4:52:55] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Strawberries are great
[4:53:06] <fairore> i really i want to try blue cheese one day

[4:53:48] <%captain_thickthighs> at this point is Paige just being a human culture for penicillin
[4:53:48] <Shadope342> just rub some brie on it
[4:53:49] <Mister_McDerp> SHE LOVES POISON
[4:53:49] <zerointelligence000> Why does she keep eating food that's alive?
[4:53:49] <GhoulishCripple> Paige don't eat a gun, it'll he moldy as well!
[4:53:49] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Are her glasses broken again?!
[4:53:49] <youngking_kush> NEVER EAT IN THE DARK
[4:53:50] <xerotwo> INSPECT DA FOOD
[4:53:52] <shiny_prinny> this is why i rarely use fresh strawberries
[4:53:54] <Slimeking_Mike> WOE, MOLD BE UPON YE

[4:54:07] <GhoulishCripple> mold queen
[4:54:08] <RushUnplugged> *cue Paige gag sounds*
[4:54:08] <Tracazoid> Inspect the burger for the worms, but everything
[4:54:11] <%Puhff> NO WHATEVER
[4:54:12] <Shiibbae> god i hope thats not how that works
[4:54:14] <Shwepie> @Bluwizard21 That also makes sense. Kraft and other cheese products are shit.
[4:54:15] <akitanito> why do you keep doing this to yourself
[4:54:16] <%NitronStreams> She MUST consume the poison
[4:54:16] <Lagseene_> Where's the excitement if you always check on your food???
[4:54:18] <%captain_thickthighs> just feed Paige jerky at least it won't expire
[4:54:18] <+Fusrahdo> monkaS
[4:54:19] <wqorst> mold is just bonus food
[4:54:20] <%DashXero> I don't understand how that keeps happening to her.
[4:54:21] <%ElkRiverDog> Speaking at inevitably
[4:54:21] <%brisk_dacat> Patt we all know Paige can’t see it’s been her thing for years
[4:54:23] <%SirGO0SE> she cant get enough of that spicy diarhea, she LOVES it
[4:54:23] <BepBepAmShep> I don't check my food like that, but I don't live with Paige.
[4:54:24] <%toolofparanoia> The mold queen cometh
[4:54:24] <Shiibbae> paige lives in blighttown
[4:54:25] <+NiktenKing> Paige dying? As if
[4:54:25] <marvel877> She inspects her burgers for worms but not everything else for mold?!
[4:54:25] <+McSoliace> its not gonna be spicy it will be moldy
[4:54:25] <Raldavar> But Pat that strawberry is just undergoing cheese-morphication
[4:54:28] <+Axellogic> Paige just want the fancy spore culture
[4:54:30] <CollinsOfBodom> ...spicy?
[4:54:30] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[4:54:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> paige is trying to become an re8 villian
[4:54:33] <%Hamborgini> get et
[4:54:37] <BepBepAmShep> So I think I'm safe
[4:54:38] <amiavamp> Pat has been inspected for mold and consumed
[4:54:38] <%GinAndRoses> is that code for food poisoning?
[4:54:41] <silentshrug> Ammo for the podcast
[4:54:42] <%Broand> you opened a shortcut but didn't take the shrine
[4:54:44] <ahmz1404> mold adds taste
[4:54:49] <GhoulishCripple> what fucks with me is I've never really checked my food, but I've never had THIS happen to me
[4:54:55] <Shwepie> Just tell Paige all food has worms in it. Problem solved.
[4:55:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> Strawberries are canonically the fastest fruit
[4:55:01] <%ElkRiverDog> Someone warn Woolie
[4:55:01] <GhoulishCripple> how do you keep encountering mold food paige
[4:55:03] <knight_verse> At this point Paige is just tempting fate.
[4:55:09] <+Jasek7> that bitter white mold flavor
[4:55:12] <%barrakuta371> well cheese is mold. no wonder Paige likes eating moldy food
[4:55:14] <Raldavar> If the strawberry identifies as cheese. You can't just deny it
[4:55:17] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> paige is an evolutionary branch that fell off and got sucked into the mower
[4:55:17] <%Taunting_Echo> Taunting_Echo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! How's This game compared to the first mechanic wise?
[4:55:18] <+Axellogic> Its likely when you are facing the yokai clouds from the dark realm
[4:55:19] <youngking_kush> I've lived in houses with roaches so I ALWAYS check my food lol
[4:55:24] <youngking_kush> Fuck that
[4:55:27] <shiny_prinny> ate every one of those hits
[4:55:28] <%SodiumPatrol> strawberries get moldy mad quick. the moment they leave the store the timer starts
[4:55:30] <altruistichat> pat your mic is on
[4:55:32] <%SirGO0SE> "ooo strawberry cheese!"
[4:55:33] <+Axellogic> Theres a big dark realm under the forge house
[4:55:45] <GhoulishCripple> you should level up pat
[4:55:52] <GhoulishCripple> you probably have 3 levels
[4:56:06] <rReizs> become huge
[4:56:06] <youngking_kush> Yeah Pat you need to fall down that hole in the middle of the room
[4:56:25] <%Agami23> hey pat, any reason you never spent your magic skill point?
[4:56:26] <%Puhff> PSAdAB\
[4:56:30] <%Puhff> psaDab
[4:56:34] <%Puhff> whoop
[4:57:17] <%SharkMissile> Sloth
[4:57:18] <+Axellogic> I reccomend purity talisman first
[4:57:19] <@GeneralSCPatton> I recommend Purification
[4:57:23] <%Agami23> you should check out the second tier of wind
[4:57:24] <%valriot> Purification is pretty good
[4:57:24] <youngking_kush> LEFT SIDE
[4:57:24] <%SharkMissile> Sloth talismans are super helpful
[4:57:24] <+Axellogic> so you can get that purity element
[4:57:25] <amiavamp> Barrier is good
[4:57:26] <%DashXero> When in doubt, go for bombs.
[4:57:27] <+pectusumbra> water seems smart given this level?
[4:57:28] <%Vextalyst> Sloth
[4:57:28] <stormhawk9891> Purity is good
[4:57:29] <RushUnplugged> water
[4:57:31] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> water
[4:57:31] <GhoulishCripple> look at Explosive shot
[4:57:31] <%Hamborgini> purity is always good since it destroys yokai ki
[4:57:32] <%vVAstrAVv> just pick
[4:57:32] <Kghaleon> No need to spend them before you have an idea what you want
[4:57:33] <ahmz1404> Sloth is boring
[4:57:34] <cricket42069> not fire lol
[4:57:35] <%DashXero> Oh. Onmyo. Never mind.
[4:57:35] <youngking_kush> No, the BUFFS
[4:57:36] <%kknutson4> always
[4:57:39] <GhoulishCripple> fire is goof
[4:57:40] <%vVAstrAVv> it can be respecced
[4:57:42] <President_valentine> Sloth isn't as broken as 1
[4:57:42] <RushUnplugged> WATER for this level.
[4:57:42] <+hrudzie_1> barrier is tkp
[4:57:43] <%Tragosavich> Isnt sloth an investment in Nioh 2?
[4:57:45] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> work your way to debuffs and buffs
[4:57:51] <crob91> Purity's a solid one to splash into
[4:57:51] <Ferakin> Purity buffs are really good in this game
[4:57:53] <Xrisic> divinations are cheap and good
[4:57:54] <President_valentine> still pretty fucking good though
[4:57:58] <Kghaleon> I'd just get the Talismans first
[4:58:00] <Vakojin> Purity is really good against yokai
[4:58:00] <youngking_kush> Barrier, Steel, all the talismans are great
[4:58:01] <+hrudzie_1> water for now is also good
[4:58:02] <%Vextalyst> Sloth and lightning are good
[4:58:02] <GhoulishCripple> water has a skill that increases elixir healing
[4:58:05] <RushUnplugged> @Tragosavich it's good but later on you get ways to get it for "free"
[4:58:05] <+cheerfulnpc> I like the healing abilities to help preserve my pile of elixirs.
[4:58:06] <Raldavar> purity is always good on every yokai and even some humans
[4:58:06] <%Hamborgini> purity
[4:58:07] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> water
[4:58:07] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> water buff
[4:58:08] <%SharkMissile> Purification
[4:58:08] <zettig> purification
[4:58:08] <scrumbotime> purification
[4:58:08] <@GeneralSCPatton> Purity
[4:58:09] <%valriot> You gain additional magic point just USING magic, so its not a big deal
[4:58:09] <+Rofiarf> water
[4:58:09] <%Djinnazz> water
[4:58:09] <RushUnplugged> WATER
[4:58:09] <%Vextalyst> Lightning
[4:58:09] <youngking_kush> LEFT
[4:58:10] <Kghaleon> Water
[4:58:10] <Shadope342> Water
[4:58:11] <+rafaelba93> water
[4:58:12] <CrimsonGargoyle> LIGHTNING MAKES THEM SLOW
[4:58:12] <%GinAndRoses> purification
[4:58:13] <amiavamp> Water is useful immediately
[4:58:13] <artoflec> i like purification, it just does ki damage
[4:58:13] <stormhawk9891> Purification is good for everything
[4:58:13] <%Tragosavich> I would get lightning for slow
[4:58:14] <%SodiumPatrol> Lightning
[4:58:15] <Vakojin> Purification
[4:58:15] <+Axellogic> Sloth is still good but not as big a deal, barrier talisman is my favorite, I reccomend purification
[4:58:15] <%CalderGaming> purification because you smell <3
[4:58:16] <kvassimoto> Purity
[4:58:16] <cricket42069> purity
[4:58:17] <+NiktenKing> H2O
[4:58:17] <crob91> purificaiton
[4:58:17] <GhoulishCripple> water or fire
[4:58:19] <%vVAstrAVv> water
[4:58:19] <%AgniBrandt> I'm a fan of lightning
[4:58:22] <CH3F015> lighting
[4:58:24] <%kknutson4> water
[4:58:24] <Mister_McDerp> PURITY
[4:58:24] <ItIsSky> water
[4:58:25] <%Blank9> water
[4:58:25] <%KnifeyMcEdge> MOLD
[4:58:26] <%Puhff> go with the bofa talisman
[4:58:28] <RushUnplugged> ON THIS LEVEL, WATER 100%
[4:58:29] <%Blank9> water is a def debuff
[4:58:29] <%Ebonyglow> poll it
[4:58:29] <+Axellogic> Water element is a good secondary cause water is a defense debuff
[4:58:30] <%Vextalyst> Lightning slows
[4:58:33] <ahmz1404> cheese
[4:58:34] <+rafaelba93> wateeer
[4:58:35] <%kujofire990> I cast Rock
[4:58:35] <@GeneralSCPatton> Water is good for this boss, but purity stomps all yokai
[4:58:36] <maskedmook> pick what seems cool
[4:58:36] <GhoulishCripple> look at the last skill of water
[4:58:37] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> water for boss
[4:58:38] <%vVAstrAVv> water is a damage buff
[4:58:40] <GhoulishCripple> the flower
[4:58:43] <CrimsonGargoyle> water drains stamina lightning makes slow purity does who the fuck knows
[4:58:43] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Whatever gets you to the Sloth Talisman fastest.
[4:58:47] <%Hamborgini> water = they take more damage, fire = fast poison, lightning = they move at half speed, purity = ki go away fast
[4:58:54] <%AgniBrandt> Fire is just damage, purification is ki damage, lightning is damage and inflicts SLOW, water is damage and makes them take extra ki damage
[4:58:58] <youngking_kush> @patstaresat Water makes them take more damage, Lightning makes them slow, Fire is DoT, Purity is Ki damage
[4:59:00] <+rafaelba93> water will save your skin very soon
[4:59:01] <+Axellogic> @CrimsonGargoyle Water does not drain stamina
[4:59:13] <%Agami23> water debuff makes it so enemies take more damage.
[4:59:18] <silentshrug> Im really glad NakeyJakey is doin alright
[4:59:28] <Kghaleon> Salt is the best item in the game against bosses if you know how to use it.
[4:59:33] <%AgniBrandt> Oh wait, water makes them take more regular damage? Shit I misremembered
[4:59:42] <DSD24> NakeyJakey just put out a vid right?!
[4:59:45] <%epide> WATER AND FIRE MIX IS AMAZING
[4:59:49] <%Agami23> electric makes enemies slower, fire is obvious, purity is extra ki damage to yokai

[5:08:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> this dude's got moves
[5:08:59] <%Djinnazz> 2 hits
[5:09:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> enenra is a tough cookie
[5:09:00] <+Axellogic> Enera is for real so yeah
[5:09:00] <%MidnightBurst12> well damn
[5:09:02] <Shadope342> enenra is nuts
[5:09:06] <DSD24> "where ever there's Smoke there is FIRE"
[5:09:06] <%JoshManVGH> He has your moves!
[5:09:09] <Kghaleon> There's a gimmick with the room
[5:09:10] <%abrupt_abe> Yep, that's what most first playthroughs on him are like
[5:09:11] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt the cutscene showed you help
[5:09:13] <%HotSauceFiend> Yeah Enera is a Pain for newcomers
[5:09:19] <theshillman> welcome to enenra
[5:09:19] <DSD24> @Jaysky Oh they are super good
[5:09:31] <%SodiumPatrol> @Jaysky yes, but vs him? ehhhh
[5:09:36] <President_valentine> I had more issues with the next boss than this one
[5:09:38] <youngking_kush> @jaysky So there are both Claws & Fists; Claws do more HP damage, Fists do more Ki damage
[5:09:44] <rasamune> He make an Big Steppy
[5:09:47] <Jaysky> @DSD24 Oh my god. This feels like the first game where claws are good and not just for show
[5:09:48] <@GeneralSCPatton> Always does
[5:09:49] <DSD24> Yeah it does
[5:09:50] <artoflec> yeah you auto-pickup in nioh 2
[5:09:52] <+Axellogic> Nioh 2 auto returns your spirit in boss rooms
[5:09:52] <%SharkMissile> Oh yeah you autocollect in boss rooms, which is amazing
[5:09:57] <shiny_prinny> yeah boss rooms auto-return the guardian now
[5:10:00] <GilliamYaeger> Fists are better than claws IMO
[5:10:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah you get it back when you enter the arena
[5:10:01] <+IxDomxI> if you die in the boss room it auto picks up
[5:10:01] <Shadope342> this game has so much more QoL to it than souls ever had
[5:10:02] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah boss rooms just give the spirit back
[5:10:02] <AnacondaVirtue> The game automatically gives you your souls back when you enter a boss room. It's really nice
[5:10:03] <GilliamYaeger> But they're the same weapon
[5:10:04] <Kghaleon> He missed it
[5:10:08] <President_valentine> Get him hin to knock it over
[5:10:09] <%AgniBrandt> Importantly, there are also Claw-exclusive skills
[5:10:16] <%HotSauceFiend> I've never noticed the BUCKETS BEFORE> I'm 200 hours in lol
[5:10:19] <GhoulishCripple> that's the other BIG thing about Nioh2. boss fights auto recover at start so you don't have to waste time picking up souls
[5:10:22] <Jaysky> Good to know chat. I always knew Nioh 2 had a ton of weapon options but never picked the game up to try it
[5:10:25] <%AgniBrandt> And the claw-exclusive stuff is GOOD
[5:10:25] <+pectusumbra> and then gets big stamnina damage
[5:10:27] <youngking_kush> @agnibrandt Bingo
[5:10:31] <+Axellogic> Make sure to hit him when he's debuffed as thats increasing your damage
[5:10:55] <+McSoliace> xmen theme
[5:10:58] <Kghaleon> Water above the pillars does ki damage, but you gotta take advantage of it
[5:10:59] <%AgniBrandt> Granted I think you have to grind like a motherfucker on a really tough boss to actually get the exclusive skills, but they're so worth it
[5:11:05] <RushUnplugged> look at that KI damage
[5:11:05] <anAngryHamster> For curiosity's sake, is it E-nen-ra or En-en-ra?
[5:11:06] <DSD24> Tornade!
[5:11:10] <nochejunior> those mini tornadoes look kinda ass tho
[5:11:16] <%MidnightPacif1c> Kreygasm
[5:11:26] <DSD24> @anAngryHamster I think its the worst one
[5:11:28] <%AgniBrandt> I'm also the lunatic who got every. single. hidden ability on one character
[5:11:31] <%HotSauceFiend> remind me, do yokai abilities consume Yokai shift guage?
[5:11:31] <fairore> this is music hittin
[5:11:32] <youngking_kush> @patstaresat ProTip: You can spam Soul Cores in Yokai Shift/Devil Trigger
[5:11:34] <DSD24> @anAngryHamster First one I mean
[5:11:39] <+bluestbee> He LITERALLY has the fucking Gundyr kick
[5:11:42] <rasamune> @anAngryHamster It's En-en-ra
[5:11:45] <Jaysky> @AgniBrandt What exactly might these skills entail that the regular claws do not have access to?
[5:11:59] <%SharkMissile> If you beat this on your second try I am going to be so impressed
[5:12:03] <TerrifyingRei_05> this music slaps
[5:12:05] <maskedmook> YO THIS FIGHT IS RAD
[5:12:17] <+Axellogic> When out of ki you can stagger them so you dont need to run
[5:12:21] <President_valentine> The Enenra is sick
[5:12:24] <Kghaleon> Almost one shotting this dude, if you discount the first attempt

[5:13:08] <RushUnplugged> @jaysky every weapon has unlockable skills that you can't learn until you drop them from specific bosses, the fist skills drop from a certain character that Team Ninja loves to use
[5:13:10] <TheMadBadger> Such a good try though! Well done!
[5:13:11] <President_valentine> use the scroll before going in the fight
[5:13:14] <+StrawHatPat_> GG
[5:13:14] <+DoktorZee> You got this!
[5:13:17] <ahmz1404> when he runs out of purple ki you can just keep hitting him
[5:13:17] <%HotSauceFiend> In your Devil trigger /Yokai shift mode you can spam the yokai abilties
[5:13:18] <%slrls_> spam yokai skills in yokai shift
[5:13:18] <%vVAstrAVv> remember you cant greed if they have ki
[5:13:21] <+sonofrobin73> Make him hit the pillars to destroy his ki
[5:13:23] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I have to go to bed, but I want to watch Pat possibly beat the boss.
[5:13:25] <fairore> this song is really cool
[5:13:25] <DSD24> its the best
[5:13:30] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> better than my like tenth
[5:13:31] <%luftraumm1> so the mind goblins are pretty beat today eh
[5:13:46] <fairore> for my first time hearing it
[5:13:49] <%JoshManVGH> Goddamn it, did Paige eat mold again!?
[5:13:50] <%AgniBrandt> @AgniBrandt Look up Tiger Claws combat art. It's an add-on to the archer's impact skill that's incredibly mobile
[5:13:51] <RushUnplugged> YO great counter
[5:13:52] <+McSoliace> all i hear is the xmen theme
[5:14:08] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You understand later that it is kind of essential as some bosses go ham in the first 3 seconds and you will die trying to get ur shit back
[5:14:14] <+pectusumbra> ooof, big damage though
[5:14:19] <youngking_kush> He's very powerful
[5:14:28] <RushUnplugged> this is legit the biggest early game wall boss, so don't feel bad
[5:14:30] <+Axellogic> You keep getting scare when you deplete his ki :V
[5:14:36] <%HotSauceFiend> why dont you use a helper ?
[5:14:46] <alwayspronking> @McSoliace Man, now I can't unhear it
[5:14:49] <President_valentine> I feel like the next boss is the real wall
[5:14:55] <+Ell1ot> every time i hear the xmen theme, i think about how it syncs up with the garfield intro
[5:15:12] <youngking_kush> The name of the game is to make sure you have full Ki when you deplete the bosses Ki
[5:15:31] <+Axellogic> @President_valentine depends on playstyle, having stuff like ippon or gozuki turns snek into a joke
[5:15:32] <youngking_kush> And then shit on him
[5:15:37] <%Valdorick> Wiff
[5:15:38] <GhoulishCripple> @president_valentine is that wind weasel? because that's the one I've seen act as a wall often
[5:15:54] <%vVAstrAVv> this boss is why i hate brute counter lol
[5:15:59] <%texaporte> texaporte subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months, currently on a 38 month streak! oh hey pat, been walking the ends and whatnot, 6/19 jobs done, i love how easy it is to max em out. stay gold, ginger king
[5:16:01] <GhoulishCripple> oh yeah nose snake
[5:16:08] <GhoulishCripple> he was easy for me
[5:16:28] <amiavamp> Snek is hard if you try to beat it with tonfas like I did...not only does it not hit the arms, it just makes him summon the arms faster with all the ki damage
[5:16:36] <+Axellogic> its only rough if you try to keep your distance
[5:16:43] <%Valdorick> Happyfeet
[5:16:45] <Who_lio42> sword snake is a hell of a wall
[5:16:50] <%HotSauceFiend> It's totally doable
[5:16:50] <%Broand> good elden ring practice
[5:16:52] <%kulmoth> nioh bosses don't fuck around
[5:16:54] <+McSoliace> that kick is why i hate range with this fight
[5:16:58] <%HotSauceFiend> not overwhelming like umibozu
[5:17:00] <Sapphire_Breeze> @ghoulishcripple I think they actually nerfed that boss after 1.0
[5:17:03] <%JoshManVGH> New plan?
[5:17:20] <youngking_kush> Its NOT bullshit, he is just strong
[5:17:23] <%Bluwizard21> @McSoliace That kick is the whole reason he is a tought boss
[5:17:30] <DSD24> Enenra hates the water bucket on the door joke
[5:17:35] <GhoulishCripple> @sapphire_breeze that's crazy. I played from launch and I don't remember him being that hard.
[5:17:47] <+McSoliace> @Bluwizard21 BIG true
[5:17:48] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt DT
[5:18:07] <DSD24> I like the Phantom DT a lot
[5:18:09] <%Bluwizard21> BANG BANG BANG PULL MY DEVIL TRIGGER!
[5:18:23] <DSD24> I like the cool floating hands and cool purple color
[5:18:25] <+pectusumbra> Dats a GOOD DT
[5:18:28] <TerrifyingRei_05> The ol' wombo combo
[5:18:31] <%Bluwizard21> phantom carried me throught the game so hard
[5:18:47] <TerrifyingRei_05> oof
[5:18:48] <%Valdorick> COMMAND GRABBED
[5:18:49] <%HotSauceFiend> Pat I noticed you dont use your ippon datara hammer and other abilities wher shifted into Brute mode. Why not? In that mode it charges fast
[5:18:49] <%Bluwizard21> oh noes
[5:18:50] <%cvp5127> LUL
[5:18:51] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> scooped
[5:18:51] <+theomnisoup> oof
[5:18:51] <SenpaiMD> He’s starting to believe…
[5:18:51] <%JoshManVGH> FUUUUUUUUUCK
[5:18:52] <ytwitchmeng> caught sleeping
[5:18:52] <%DianaTheAscian> bull
[5:18:52] <%Broand> Looks lik
[5:18:52] <+Axellogic> he do them grabs sometime
[5:18:53] <%Agami23> command grabbed
[5:18:53] <DSD24> Command Grabbed
[5:18:53] <%MidnightBurst12> oof
[5:18:54] <Vakojin> A tip : Spirit attacks are stronger on a yokai when they're out of purple bar.
[5:18:55] <shiny_prinny> oh shit the command grab
[5:18:55] <%DashXero> Never seen that before.
[5:18:56] <artoflec> fug
[5:18:58] <%Broand> you got blown away
[5:18:59] <Kghaleon> Lucky streak ends
[5:18:59] <Mister_McDerp> REKT
[5:18:59] <DSD24> He did his wake up 720
[5:19:00] <%abrupt_abe> psaDogchamp
[5:19:01] <%Bluwizard21> the reversal
[5:19:02] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> stop running away when he is out of ki
[5:19:09] <President_valentine> Yeah brute is sometimes fucked like that
[5:19:09] <GhoulishCripple> I chose feral because aestheticd and I stayed for sick nasty stabby knives
[5:19:09] <Slimeking_Mike> oh it can just do that huh
[5:19:10] <Shadope342> brute counter life
[5:19:11] <youngking_kush> Brute Counter is alitte slow on him
[5:19:13] <%vVAstrAVv> see if you went in when he had no ki itd be over
[5:19:13] <+McSoliace> the brute counter is weak to grabs
[5:19:14] <cricket42069> mcFreakin Pogged on
[5:19:15] <Kghaleon> Pain begins
[5:19:15] <+rafaelba93> dont stay too close
[5:19:15] <DSD24> Grabs are really brutal in this game
[5:19:15] <%abrupt_abe> This man pressing buttons
[5:19:16] <+Axellogic> Yeah most grabs are too fast for Brute
[5:19:16] <%Valdorick> Boss wake up supered
[5:19:18] <shiny_prinny> the other weakness of brute is fast red attacks
[5:19:19] <+rafaelba93> i think
[5:19:20] <+Inferno_Icon> dunked lytKILLGOKU
[5:19:21] <artoflec> that was kinda some BS i couldnt tell that move was different from the normal tornado thing
[5:19:29] <%charp35> If they have no ki keep attacking
[5:19:35] <%MidnightBurst12> 100% woke and still got caught LUL
[5:19:36] <DSD24> Also some Yokai counters are better then what Brute can do
[5:19:36] <+sonofrobin73> I recommend using the dodge counter burst
[5:19:36] <+aWanderingKaivo> I was afk how many attempts we at
[5:19:39] <%Vextalyst> Pat don't forget bosses stagger from every hit when they're out of stamina
[5:19:45] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[5:19:45] <cricket42069> 3
[5:19:47] <DSD24> Phantom is a Parry for example
[5:19:54] <ferbeholds> remember to end combos with the yokay
[5:19:59] <Raldavar> Pat legit could've won the first try if he remembered he has abilities that cost meter but doesn't consume stamina
[5:20:01] <rReizs> wild is a dodge
[5:20:04] <Raldavar> the boss was at 2%
[5:20:07] <+TopTieramisu> yokay
[5:20:07] <+theomnisoup> My problem with feral DT is that it lacks the hyperamror of the other 2 forms
[5:20:17] <cricket42069> it helped me a lot to dodge sideways instead of back
[5:20:23] <+pectusumbra> Mercifully short run to the boss
[5:20:25] <%Vextalyst> Yeah it is a hard balance
[5:20:29] <%HotSauceFiend> Phantom is Perfect Parry, Feral is Dodge counter and Brute is preemptive counter. Phantom is great if learned
[5:20:31] <@StridentSong> StridentSong subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 60 months, currently on a 60 month streak! Something witty, I dunno.
[5:20:46] <DSD24> That was great
[5:20:49] <%Vextalyst> this boss's attack when he regains stamina is annoying
[5:20:49] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[5:20:55] <+Axellogic> you can block the tonadoes
[5:20:55] <Vakojin> When a yokai is out of purple bar, spirit attacks are super effective to drain them and put them on the ground.
[5:21:01] <DSD24> Enenra is such a jerk
[5:21:03] <Pillagius> now it's balanced
[5:21:09] <President_valentine> I found Phantom to be the easiest to counter with
[5:21:13] <%HotSauceFiend> PAt use your yokai abilities more often
[5:21:15] <+pectusumbra> I mean beating this guy seems like the ending
[5:21:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> gotta beat it now when you're in it
[5:21:19] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> oh SHIT i was missing Nioh 2
[5:21:22] <+theomnisoup> Phantom parry is extremely forgiving compared to the others
[5:21:25] <+McSoliace> holy shit its been 5 hours
[5:21:27] <+Axellogic> I'm just glad you seem to be enjoying the game part rather than being frozen by the mechanics
[5:21:38] <greatthelong> use low stance for dash
[5:21:48] <Kghaleon> You don't want to spend the entire night thinking about that boss that beat you? HahaDoge
[5:22:00] <+TopTieramisu> this game is so good
[5:22:07] <youngking_kush> You might need to low stance for the dodge, especially using Odachi
[5:22:17] <%HotSauceFiend> wait this is a mind goblin stream? What for?
[5:22:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Enenra beat up Paige oh noes
[5:22:35] <%Hamborgini> @HotSauceFiend he's skipping nioh 1 to play this instead
[5:22:42] <Kghaleon> @HotSauceFiend Skipping Dark souls and going straight to Dark souls 3
[5:23:07] <%HotSauceFiend> I mean, its not really a problem until  last base game chaper
[5:23:12] <%HotSauceFiend> story wise
[5:23:25] <%DashXero> Oh. THAT'S where the goblins lie.
[5:23:29] <+TopTieramisu> nioh 1 is totally skippable for 2
[5:23:36] <%Hamborgini> that's not the point, though. The point is this is the second one and he didn't finish the first one.
[5:23:47] <Kghaleon> @TopTieramisu Nah, this game is a prequel and a sequel
[5:23:56] <President_valentine> It's also better if you save the water buckets for when he goes to the Yokai realm
[5:24:01] <scrumbotime> that dog is a powerhouse
[5:24:11] <%SharkMissile> Free water!!!!
[5:24:12] <%Visorak6> "I NEED TO BE PURE"
[5:24:18] <%Puhff> he return to fishe
[5:24:18] <Shwepie> It's just a big water bowl to them.
[5:24:24] <%Djinnazz> that's where the PRIMO WATER IS, YOU KNOW THAT.
[5:24:24] <+TopTieramisu> i never cared for nioh's story so maybe i'm biased
[5:24:27] <%DashXero> It's usually because the water in the toilet is the coldest water available.
[5:24:30] <+TopTieramisu> it's just fantasized nobunaga
[5:24:31] <+VentWilsn> hes a fan of "Flushed Away"
[5:24:31] <@GeneralSCPatton> Toilets are where the magic happens
[5:24:35] <+Axellogic> So did you defeat your goblins today?
[5:24:36] <+McSoliace> cause poo doesn't smell bad to them
[5:24:38] <%greasypete00> incredible fight
[5:24:43] <greatthelong> be calm and slow, don't rush
[5:24:47] <Pillagius> BTW, I wonder if you can do the belly drop move
[5:25:01] <%HotSauceFiend> Nioh 1's story is meh honestly. Nioh 2 was more interesting imo
[5:25:10] <youngking_kush> The story is fine, it's historical fiction
[5:25:16] <%noobazzazzin> howa the game so far pat just came in
[5:25:17] <+aWanderingKaivo> it is nice that runs from the last shrine to the boss are so short in this
[5:25:28] <%KnifeyMcEdge> do those pillars do anything?
[5:25:28] <youngking_kush> So like, real names and locations but demons nshit
[5:25:34] <%Blank9> the music for this fight is way better than like, any nioh 1 song
[5:25:44] <+TopTieramisu> yeah historical fiction of the most representated figure and period in japanese media
[5:25:45] <kinkade_77> is he under leveled or is this game just that hard?
[5:25:48] <President_valentine> My favorite thing in 1 is William not really giving a shit about the plot
[5:25:52] <amiavamp> There are some bad boss runs in this, the first level of dlc1 puts a big odachi guy right in your path
[5:25:54] <Kghaleon> @GeneralSCPatton I miss poop castle from Nioh 1
[5:25:57] <President_valentine> He just wants his spirit back
[5:25:59] <+TopTieramisu> how many god damn nobunaga anime are there
[5:26:08] <ahmz1404> you got this
[5:26:10] <Pillagius> @kinkade_77 it's just Pat...
[5:26:10] <+aWanderingKaivo> I love the music for magara naotaka's fight
[5:26:12] <%Bluwizard21> yeah he's a mother alright
[5:26:13] <%Vextalyst> ok that was bs
[5:26:18] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> he almost always phase changes with that move
[5:26:21] <theshillman> this fucking boss man
[5:26:26] <%androidd3162> Are you gonna play New War? (Warframe)
[5:26:26] <@GeneralSCPatton> Grind red phantoms for new gear?
[5:26:28] <%Hamborgini> you can't burst counter the realm shift changing attack I don't think
[5:26:29] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt This is The Butcher of Nioh 2
[5:26:30] <amiavamp> @kinkade_77 he's actually doing good damage comparatively
[5:26:31] <+McSoliace> at least there's no boss run
[5:26:36] <+aWanderingKaivo> and the music for a certain big spoiler fight or two
[5:26:36] <+pectusumbra> that is one thing I'm not crazy about looking at this, damage on you is so high
[5:26:37] <%Blank9> a lot of this is about really dumping ass during those staggers
[5:26:46] <+RobertWayneLewis98> I was here 4 hours ago, looks like difficulty ramped up huh?
[5:26:49] <%epide> hes a tough one i had to summon to beat em i had to for the next 2 as well
[5:26:49] <%Bluwizard21> he has everything he needs for the boss he just needs to get on point
[5:26:50] <%Blank9> yokai shift during stagger especially
[5:26:56] <%HotSauceFiend> @GeneralSCPatton it's not necessary. It's execution that needs to e refined
[5:27:07] <+sonofrobin73> Enenra is definitely one of those "learn the game, idiot" kind of bosses
[5:27:22] <%Blank9> you can slap him out of tornado if you believe
[5:27:31] <@GeneralSCPatton> @hotsaucefiend True. My first instinct is always just bigger number.
[5:27:47] <cricket42069> dodging sideways instead of back is a big deal here, lets you keep punching him almost constantly
[5:27:52] <%HotSauceFiend> like learn to use the yokai shift and abilities at the right time. spam the abilities when in brute mode, counter well.
[5:28:04] <GhoulishCripple> don't forget your R2+hold circle combo ender pat
[5:28:10] <+TopTieramisu> SMACK
[5:28:10] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> boom
[5:28:12] <%Bluwizard21> BIG MONEY
[5:28:14] <shiny_prinny> big damage
[5:28:15] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> thats some big damage
[5:28:16] <+aWanderingKaivo> @GeneralSCPatton it would help to get all the ki pulse on dodge skills, didn't see if Pat got all 3 or not yet
[5:28:17] <%DianaTheAscian> melting
[5:28:25] <Mr_Rakjo> PogChamp
[5:28:30] <%Bluwizard21> oooh
[5:28:30] <cricket42069> nice
[5:28:32] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> noT LIKE THIS
[5:28:33] <Pillagius> just scratch him!
[5:28:33] <amiavamp> THROW A ROCK AT EM
[5:28:33] <+TopTieramisu> imagine he lost trying to style
[5:28:38] <%MidnightBurst12> holy shit
[5:28:38] <%Bluwizard21> 1 HIT
[5:28:39] <Pillagius> spit at him!
[5:28:40] <+Axellogic> f you want more yokai form you can put amrita stones on your hotbar to pop them mid fight.
[5:28:41] <Mr_Rakjo> Almost Choked LUL
[5:28:42] <%Hamborgini> he do it!
[5:28:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> noice
[5:28:43] <ahmz1404> that's a GG
[5:28:45] <%greasypete00> yeyeye

[5:28:47] <Pillagius> GG?..
[5:28:48] <President_valentine> Yeah. you did it

[5:28:53] <%MidnightBurst12> too close
[5:28:53] <%Hamborgini> hey, you got a yokai fist weapon!

[5:28:59] <%Samuy_JP> GJ Pat
[5:29:01] <+Local16> Got the yokai fists too
[5:29:01] <%captain_thickthighs> soul core
[5:29:03] <+sonofrobin73> Runnin stab attack on odachi is GOAT
[5:29:05] <%MidnightPacif1c> psaUp
[5:29:06] <Who_lio42> yeah the main issue with the brute counter is it cant counter a lot a things reliably but it does get to hit some things others cant
[5:29:07] <%SharkMissile> Good job
[5:29:13] <%SodiumPatrol> @Bluwizard21 Twinkie House
[5:29:14] <%HotSauceFiend> Solid
[5:29:14] <%Blank9> you can do SO MUCH damage with yokai shift
[5:29:15] <%SharkMissile> Niiiiice
[5:29:17] <+aWanderingKaivo> awesome you got em
[5:29:23] <+Exicuren> WOOOO
[5:29:24] <%Broand> hype
[5:29:29] <%MidnightBurst12> purple is good
[5:29:31] <@GeneralSCPatton> Awesome
[5:29:33] <%Puhff> neat
[5:29:34] <%SodiumPatrol> yooo yokai fist?! psaFist psaBig
[5:29:34] <+Axellogic> also anyweapon can drop with corruption as a random stat if it doesnt already have an element
[5:29:38] <GhoulishCripple> @patstaresat you have 2 pages of hotbars, R1+ left on dpad swaps it. you have 4 more to use
[5:29:40] <%Vextalyst> @PatStaresAt Seriously good job pat this took me 14 tries
[5:29:41] <+pectusumbra> ahhh, it's the spider boy claws
[5:29:43] <%androidd3162> Are you gonna play New War? (Warframe)
[5:29:48] <%SharkMissile> Yes!
[5:29:50] <%Bluwizard21> kinda yes
[5:29:50] <Vakojin> Later
[5:29:50] <GhoulishCripple> yes
[5:29:52] <%valriot> yes
[5:29:53] <%Djinnazz> yes
[5:29:53] <youngking_kush> Yes
[5:29:54] <GhoulishCripple> soul match
[5:29:54] <%DashXero> Yes.
[5:29:54] <shiny_prinny> yes, soul match in shop
[5:29:54] <%Broand> I think so?
[5:29:54] <%Hamborgini> yes, with the blacksmith
[5:29:55] <+aWanderingKaivo> yes there is, its called soul matching at the blacksmith
[5:29:55] <+Axellogic> Yes soul matching is back from 1
[5:29:55] <%SharkMissile> At the blacksmith.
[5:29:57] <amiavamp> Yeah, there's Soul Match at the blacksmith
[5:29:58] <silentshrug> sniktbub
[5:29:58] <youngking_kush> Soul Match
[5:29:58] <Pillagius> sort of
[5:29:58] <+Exicuren> Yes
[5:29:58] <%HotSauceFiend> you can level up weapons at the smithy using soul match
[5:30:03] <%valriot> but youll probably find better ones too
[5:30:06] <%Blank9> later, but you'll get better purple weapons too
[5:30:07] <%Vextalyst> Later but it gets really expensive
[5:30:10] <%captain_thickthighs> blacksmith
[5:30:11] <EvolNom> No
[5:30:11] <%abrupt_abe> Soul match is ludicrously expensive at first
[5:30:14] <+Axellogic> Also fun fact you can soul match corrupted weapons with soul cores
[5:30:15] <%Blank9> purple is just an element basically
[5:30:19] <Kghaleon> Check out speedruns for this game to see how much you can break a lot of the bosses
[5:30:19] <BepBepAmShep> kind of, but it's limited and expensive
[5:30:19] <%HotSauceFiend> now that you finished this chapter YES
[5:30:22] <soapyillusions7> Soul match for level
[5:30:25] <%SharkMissile> The blacksmith is basically useless on NG, though
[5:30:26] <@GeneralSCPatton> You can Soul Match to bring the level up and transfer exactly 1 inheritable bonus
[5:30:27] <%charp35> Yes, at the blacksmith
[5:30:27] <ahmz1404> Really only when the levels are both the same, so don't bother keeping lower levels
[5:30:29] <GhoulishCripple> same rarity or higher + higher level will upgrade a weapons level and reset its familiarity
[5:30:29] <+aWanderingKaivo> its cheaper with yokai weapons though and you can feed them soul cores
[5:30:38] <soapyillusions7> Temper for abilities
[5:30:38] <Pillagius> Really this early - don't bother with soulmatching or blacksmith in general...
[5:30:41] <youngking_kush> This is Diablo tho Pat so you will get a shit ton of gear
[5:30:48] <%HotSauceFiend> but there was money on the floor....
[5:30:50] <EvolNom> Pat love your podcast, you guys get me through so many work nights
[5:30:51] <+Axellogic> Soul matching requires they be the same rarity of equipment though

[5:31:53] <%DashXero> I didn't know.
[5:31:56] <GhoulishCripple> Tokichiro is amazing in English
[5:31:56] <+Axellogic> the sad part of detailed lip sync is how much more obvious dubbing is
[5:32:00] <Admiral_PopnFresh> no, they are kinda terrible
[5:32:03] <%Puhff> yeah i love em
[5:32:05] <%Bluwizard21> SO BRITISH
[5:32:10] <%Blank9> it is a very English dub

[5:32:19] <%MidnightBurst12> it has it's charm
[5:32:20] <+toomuchsnarf> is this Xenoblade 2
[5:32:22] <Lynxystem> ok but why are they british?
[5:32:25] <+Exicuren> english is good, it's just that the japanese VA is better
[5:32:25] <Kghaleon> This dude sounds like a himbo in Japanese
[5:32:35] <+D00msDayDan> asians speaking british, it's like i'm back in hong kong
[5:32:35] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[5:32:36] <%KetsuoTaberu> yeah this english dub makes no sense
[5:32:37] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I hate the British voices. alot.
[5:32:39] <%Valdorick> What if you instead lay yokai?
[5:32:43] <Admiral_PopnFresh> If only he could be so grossly incandescent
[5:32:43] <President_valentine> Racist
[5:32:43] <+pectusumbra> Did you not tell from the part where you shoot people's head's off?
[5:32:45] <%SharkMissile> She's so Tsundere
[5:32:48] <+kewlmyc> She seems fun at parties
[5:32:48] <%DashXero> She's so cool.
[5:32:49] <%SaiyanShoto> It's like Xenoblade, everyone's bri ish
[5:32:54] <scrumbotime> she can sense your baldness and it made her angry
[5:32:58] <%SharkMissile> @Valdorick Why would you say something so controvertial, yet so brave?
[5:33:01] <%Hamborgini> I wonder if you'll become friends later after many adventures?
[5:33:01] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> The english dub sucks so much that goes back to being cool
[5:33:02] <Parapattern> Oi Wuts all this then?
[5:33:06] <%HotSauceFiend> Man I want to rewatch the whole story now with dubs
[5:33:07] <%SharkMissile> She copes to your mald

[5:33:16] <+kewlmyc> EW, A CANADIAN
[5:33:17] <President_valentine> That's another good one

[5:33:18] <+aWanderingKaivo> hell yeah you can
[5:33:19] <+D00msDayDan> more games need british dubs
[5:33:20] <%HotSauceFiend> BEST ABILITY EVER

[5:33:22] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Ain't no Sam-your-eye
[5:33:22] <+Axellogic> yep
[5:33:24] <%captain_thickthighs> she can keep the mask on but the scythe stays
[5:33:24] <toahmes> This dub actually sounds good, it's just weird after playing with the japanese voices
[5:33:26] <+Axellogic> spin to win
[5:33:26] <%MidnightBurst12> hell yeah man
[5:33:31] <%Blank9> soul cores get nuts
[5:33:31] <youngking_kush> You can do all the cool things in this game
[5:33:32] <President_valentine> Boss souls tend to be nuts
[5:33:34] <amiavamp> It's pretty good but it eats anima while you hold it
[5:33:43] <amiavamp> You can't
[5:33:44] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat the lip syncing is off in the english dub thats why we dont like it, its very noticeable.
[5:33:45] <Who_lio42> beware itll drain ALL your bar when you use it
[5:33:45] <+pectusumbra> what stat is it?
[5:33:48] <efratzy> different spirits
[5:33:49] <shiny_prinny> it's preset
[5:33:50] <+Axellogic> you dont its static by the Guardian spirit
[5:33:51] <%Djinnazz> you don't
[5:33:53] <%Hamborgini> change spirits, or it will go up at a certain point in the game
[5:33:54] <scrumbotime> different summon
[5:33:56] <%SharkMissile> It's set by the spirit you equip
[5:33:56] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Depends on the Guardian Spirit
[5:33:58] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> different Spirit Guardians have different vaules
[5:33:59] <%SharkMissile> Stronger spirit = more slots
[5:33:59] <youngking_kush> It depends on your Guardian Spirit
[5:34:00] <+Axellogic> some spirits have higher limits
[5:34:00] <Who_lio42> you dont, at most you can reduce cost on some
[5:34:01] <%Djinnazz> You make core cost less
[5:34:01] <%Blank9> different guardian spirits
[5:34:06] <+pectusumbra> ahhhhh, I see
[5:34:18] <%DashXero> Time for new moves!
[5:34:20] <%HotSauceFiend> ahh time for angyo and ungyo points

[5:45:13] <%superc37> i don't think so
[5:45:21] <Pillagius> stop blocking attacks with your head, Pat!
[5:45:36] <Admiral_PopnFresh> repeat bosses tend to be
[5:45:43] <@GeneralSCPatton> It's probably scaled to a higher level

[5:50:20] <T_Sasquatch> Its just a game Bruh
[5:50:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> here in Chicago we have to have vacation verification now
