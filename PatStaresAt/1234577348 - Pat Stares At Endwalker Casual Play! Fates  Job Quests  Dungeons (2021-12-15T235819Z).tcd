[0:20:25] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Trumpet curtesy of Jammingway
[0:20:28] <%hoodedlefty> Sage trailer theme and the best boss name and best attack name in one dungeon
[0:20:33] <orbulon> as a healer i love new warrior too
[0:20:34] <%JoshManVGH> Love this dungeon!
[0:20:36] <+FZeroDMX> @saltmeisterr it‚Äôs a level 90
[0:20:42] <funkerbuster> optional dungeon btw
[0:20:42] <@CreepyPorpoise> bout to troll my fucking tank
[0:20:42] <jubejube56> Oh look, it's the Ontario real estate market
[0:20:43] <+cawlin> are you gonna be bunny for an ever?
[0:20:43] <+FZeroDMX> So after msq
[0:20:44] <ape_hawk> youre testing their patience
[0:20:45] <%rekinom> Can't believe Pat's griefing instead of Giefing PoroSad
[0:20:47] <+Fetrigon> Kappa
[0:20:49] <Saltmeisterr> ah
[0:20:49] <draca23> Warrior is so good, I may switch from Paladin to it
[0:20:56] <+REDtheBEAST> A test of your reflexes!
[0:20:59] <+Melthius36> this dungeon makes me dizzy
[0:21:00] <%hoodedlefty> Get off my law
[0:21:14] <%Felhad> This dungeon rules
[0:21:24] <%Tarage> Why were these space buns allowed to build this?
[0:21:26] <Ahack13> does summoner just have no buttons anymore?
[0:21:35] <+Melthius36> its like that inception scene
[0:21:36] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @hoodedlefty i find myself wanting to buy the expansions cause I wanna be a sword Samurai man. but I'm not where near the level lol
[0:21:36] <Ethrion> man I wish  the warriors first aoe was a circle
[0:21:43] <%hoodedlefty> This is the new twinning imo
[0:21:46] <%Neryl_> You know, Streamer, there are **no** mods for FFXIV. But if there were, I bet there'd be one that would scream at you for not having tank stance on when you started a dungeon. @PatStaresAt
[0:21:48] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh dang nice
[0:22:03] <%VictorVonLouche> Like 8 buttons to put on the hotbar now lol
[0:22:03] <+Koopert_> SMN has 3 active buttons, and two of them are charge based lmao. the other is ruin 3. actual baby class now i love it
[0:22:28] <KeiPrime> jesus all that green in the inventory
[0:22:30] <%TheHateFish> Wait, did you just get surprised that someone in a postgame dungeon has finished the MSQ? @PatStaresAt
[0:22:34] <Ahack13> I was putting them on my bar and its like everything is just an upgrade of an older skill, lol.
[0:22:35] <+Koopert_> havent finished EW yet so trying not to look at the screen
[0:22:37] <KeiPrime> smn is fuckin awesome right now
[0:22:43] <BobbyHopp> PLD feels good gameplay wise but needs some of that dank potency boost
[0:22:46] <@CreepyPorpoise> creepy49Porpkek
[0:22:49] <KeiPrime> big number class
[0:22:55] <+Fetrigon> welp. those are gone. LUL
[0:22:56] <%Evil_John_Cena> @PatStaresAt when does the training start for Zangief to do suplexes and spinning lariats?
[0:23:01] <%Birdigalore> F A C E
[0:23:04] <+Melthius36> syncing down confused the hell out of me on SMN bc all actions changed
[0:23:04] <VioletHeart> Summoner feels like it needs a dash more complexity but otherwise it's great.
[0:23:05] <%SuckerPunchSyd> SMN looks nice but gosh darn it people‚Äôs summons keep blocking my steam
[0:23:07] <+Fetrigon> @creepyporpoise porp PunOko
[0:23:09] <JustinPM> F A C E
[0:23:10] <%hoodedlefty> Koop you can tab over it
[0:23:15] <%Neryl_> @Koopert_ Is it really? I always wanted to play it but didn't want to do the flowchart.
[0:23:15] <+FZeroDMX> Nothing beats just bahamuting the fuck out of world mobs
[0:23:17] <%TheHateFish> Ah, see, I didn't get that
[0:23:21] <%TheHateFish> That makes more sense
[0:23:28] <%Dakuu75> this game has NG+ ???... but... it's an MMO... wtf?
[0:23:29] <TurtlesAndTentacles> SMN is summoner. what's Sage? is it just... Sage?
[0:23:31] <%furiousfurioso> coxJam
[0:23:34] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Smiles for miles
[0:23:34] <ape_hawk> oh no, the most fiercesome enemy: FACE
[0:23:35] <%Felhad> @suckerpunchsyd make um smaller
[0:23:37] <cloakofashes> Tank that face!
[0:23:40] <BobbyHopp> internal release on 60 seconds has made warriors flow feel so much better
[0:23:44] <+FZeroDMX> Sage is SGE
[0:23:48] <%afronooch> @Dakuu75 its basically a story replay
[0:23:50] <Saltmeisterr> its ratJAM time boys
[0:23:56] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @dakuu75 it lets you replay the beats at your current level
[0:23:58] <KeiPrime> facetank
[0:24:18] <TurtlesAndTentacles> ahh
[0:24:21] <%hoodedlefty> Favorite attack name
[0:24:27] <+Melthius36> imagine if Tellah had laser pens for weapons
[0:24:38] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @felhad I cant, i dont play summoner er wait can i change their size regardless?
[0:24:43] <%Tarage> Keep orb in check.
[0:24:52] <+Koopert_> @Koopert_ as a new summoner player, coming from BLM/NIN for the entirety of ShB, new summoner is very flowchart. the most optimization you get is ifrit needing to be aware of cast times, and standing close enough for your ifrit/titan egi to get their spawn cast off in an efficient manner
[0:25:04] <%Tarage> OFF MY LAWN
[0:25:10] <+FZeroDMX> Man I generally don‚Äôt like DPS but much but they killed it with Reaper. So fun.
[0:25:30] <TheeRabbi> Is that boss just a big ass tiki mask?
[0:25:30] <+Koopert_> but theres no DoT, no tons of buffs to keep make sure theyre lined up. everything is automatic for the most part
[0:25:39] <+Melthius36> i want to be able to place titan on top of BLM ley lines
[0:25:44] <%Tarage> She should let you die out of spite.
[0:25:48] <%Fenrirlives> Fenrirlives subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months! Hey Pat! How's life going? Hope No Lifin' Endwalker didn't have any adverse health effects, and that you're taking good care of yourself! I'm kind of a wreck now after my grandmother passed, but watching your EW vods has been nice! Love ya Buddy!
[0:25:51] <%hoodedlefty> You crazy Warriors of Light get off my lawn!
[0:25:52] <+Fetrigon> sick KomodoHype
[0:25:58] <%Dakuu75> So, I get FC invites a lot and I usually just ignore them... but, I got an invite from Kenpachi Ramasama" and was like... I CAN'T say no, to that name
[0:26:07] <%shurtal> Bloodwhetting feels like it's gonna get nerfed, its so good
[0:26:07] <%Tarage> Let's test this.
[0:26:08] <%Alazull> SMN is at a good place for added complexity in the future
[0:26:12] <%VictorVonLouche> I see warriors just solo bosses on what would be wipes
[0:26:18] <TurtlesAndTentacles> this saxophone is really nice.
[0:26:34] <ss_goku3> hey pat how did you like the videogame msq
[0:26:37] <BobbyHopp> cant believe they gave warriors a sonic spindash attack
[0:26:39] <%rekinom> We ran 4 DPS and a WAR for our expert today
[0:26:43] <%Tarage> I mean I did see a tank solo the big uh... second boss from the final dungeon when everyone else died from like 25% to 0.
[0:26:44] <%rekinom> 3 DPS*
[0:26:50] <%RealThiele> WAR is ridiculous
[0:27:06] <+Necayde> WAR can heal a DRKs living dead before they die to walking dead
[0:27:13] <%Tarage> lol dark knight
[0:27:13] <%Fenrirlives> I will miss Patron's DRK edge, but WAR is pretty baller
[0:27:15] <%JohnAtDawn> Please explain that sentiment further?
[0:27:15] <%VictorVonLouche> Do think War will end up getting their healing nerfed.
[0:27:22] <%Tarage> DRK is too busy cutting themselves.
[0:27:24] <%Dianaillumani> coxJam coxJam coxJam coxJam
[0:27:35] <%RealThiele> it does remind me of old Blood DK from WoW where your active mitigation is just big green number
[0:27:37] <+orochiblood> lol no FFXIV content creators I watch like current DRK either
[0:27:40] <%Jackalope322> dude the self sustain is nutty
[0:27:43] <+KawaiiJetty> DRK is busy not tanking  lol
[0:27:54] <%TheHateFish> @VictorVonLouche Either WAR gets nerfed or all the other tanks get buffed - WAR is too good right now
[0:27:55] <+FZeroDMX> Primal rend owns
[0:28:03] <+KawaiiJetty> but it's still decent for dungeon tanking, not any close to Warrior though
[0:28:10] <%Tarage> EX raid whe
[0:28:12] <+Fetrigon> why people dislike new DRK?
[0:28:25] <%Tarage> DRK did not get new button
[0:28:29] <%Tarage> Therefor DRK sad.
[0:28:30] <ss_goku3> paladin needs help for sure
[0:28:35] <KeiPrime> all three tanks, and drk
[0:28:36] <%RealThiele> and DRK LUL
[0:28:41] <+Kyma1020> Just give oblation a self heal or something
[0:28:41] <KeiPrime> InuyoFace
[0:28:54] <%VictorVonLouche> SGEs really do suck healing GNB and DRK i feel
[0:28:54] <+SpaceHobo55> 1% more damage everyone loses their minds, thats the ff people for you
[0:29:06] <%Alazull> Snapshotting ftw
[0:29:18] <+Melthius36> the darkest blackest night
[0:29:18] <+Fetrigon> all this over not getting a new button? PunOko
[0:29:21] <%RealThiele> also: the rabbits wanted us to live here insanity
[0:29:32] <%VictorVonLouche> Also the music is slightly drowning out your voice.
[0:29:43] <%Tarage> What if they just delete DRK from the game?
[0:29:43] <+orochiblood> just give DRK a heart of corundum, call it heart of darkness or something.
[0:29:46] <%Alazull> They could also increase the heal potency on that one attack that gives you health as DRK
[0:29:55] <KeiPrime> heart of corundum isa  do everything button
[0:30:00] <%baka_sugoi> now its low
[0:30:01] <%afronooch> LUL
[0:30:02] <TheeRabbi> Diet Hot Topic music

[0:30:36] <+Fetrigon> @ssjklyco hi :)
[0:30:41] <%cvp5127> why is there a loud baby man talking?
[0:30:45] <@PrefectusCorgi> When does Chat care about what the Streamer Says
[0:30:47] <KeiPrime> made him get a stack, nice work guys we did it
[0:30:47] <%RealThiele> 1 x Badge of honor
[0:30:55] <%baka_sugoi> O R B
[0:30:57] <EscoSul> superbolide with heart of corundum is neato
[0:30:59] <%Tarage> Why is the orb so big?
[0:31:00] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Thats a lie
[0:31:05] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I saw you change it
[0:31:18] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Baby zangief
[0:31:21] <Rein_Paladin> does smileton drop anything actually good
[0:31:23] <+Kyma1020> 2382 in queue started at 3500 half an hour ago
[0:31:23] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:31:23] <%CzeekyTV> Smileton's music tho
[0:31:24] <+orochiblood> just give DRK Heart of Corundum and call it Heart of Farkness, you're welcome Square
[0:31:27] <%Alazull> The other one has better bosses
[0:31:29] <+the22cstomp> it's kinda weird how like all the promo music for endwalker was all endgame music
[0:31:29] <KnivesEve> i like the omicron one
[0:31:30] <+orochiblood> DARKNESS0- damn
[0:31:31] <%RealThiele> Stigma way better
[0:31:37] <KeiPrime> i think both dungeons are just accesories thats all ive seen
[0:31:37] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I think it just drops jewlery
[0:31:38] <Camo_boy67> I love you pat!!!!
[0:31:42] <%Tarage> 3d printer robots
[0:31:44] <+Kyma1020> Big Cheese tho
[0:31:44] <%SuckerPunchSyd> But dont quote me on that
[0:31:48] <%shurtal> and aphorism tomestones
[0:31:48] <+zenraider> are you gonna play summoner? it would be cool to see come gameplay
[0:31:49] <EscoSul> it's just i560 accs
[0:31:56] <%CryoByjorne> I like this dungeon's music
[0:31:57] <KeiPrime> well yeah and tomes
[0:32:05] <%RealThiele> SMN gameplay feels so good
[0:32:05] <+Melthius36> does this mean we're getting moon housing?
[0:32:14] <%Alazull> I'm not gonna lie the idea of magic 3d printers is pretty fucking sick
[0:32:19] <+2DSuperiority> I want to become Lop
[0:32:23] <%RealThiele> fuck holy 2
[0:32:23] <MonsterGills> is this kingdom hearts 2?
[0:32:30] <KeiPrime> i dont wanna take it for granted but both post game dungeons having baller tracks is kinda par for the course
[0:32:31] <%JoshManVGH> Wooooow
[0:32:33] <+badhaye> on Hyperion with the FC waiting for the TV mount world boss to show up
[0:32:33] <%Double_Tap_That> It's kinda weird that they went from 1 to 3 for Holy and Glare
[0:32:41] <%Chichen> Primal Rend gives my brain the godo chemicals
[0:32:42] <%Chichen> good*
[0:32:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> sorry if it's been asked but have you done/seen the ex trials?
[0:32:44] <%JoshManVGH> That insane in trash pulls
[0:32:46] <+REDtheBEAST> crit heals Kreygasm
[0:33:08] <KeiPrime> he just hanging out there
[0:33:11] <%JoshManVGH> Is DRK more viable without wall to wall pulls? Boss fights seem fine.
[0:33:22] <%Tarage> Holidays are unimportant FFXIV is forever.
[0:33:31] <%Double_Tap_That> I feel like Bloodwhetting getting guaranteed crit heals is unintentional.
[0:33:35] <%Chichen> DRK has the highest damage output of the tanks but shit sustain
[0:33:36] <%RealThiele> DRK suffers from boring
[0:33:39] <KeiPrime> holidays are IN ff14 where they're BETTER
[0:33:43] <%JoshManVGH> Only trust in healer
[0:33:48] <%SveriSageAdvice> they're miserable to heal
[0:33:50] <%legendfather_of_giants> they have abyssal drain but it sucks
[0:33:52] <%Agami23> nearly all of paladins moves heal now. which makes DRK seem even worse in my mind
[0:33:58] <%JoshManVGH> Which in pugs is sad...
[0:34:03] <Rein_Paladin> pat is initiating unga, with a helping of bunga
[0:34:05] <%JohnAtDawn> Aw man, they took Abyssal Drain out of the game?
[0:34:09] <%valriot> Xenos said DRK levelling was the most miserable experience in the game LUL LUL
[0:34:11] <+Kyma1020> Stalwart Soul or the Salted Earth combo should have at least some self heal
[0:34:13] <%JohnAtDawn> Somehow I didn't notice that
[0:34:24] <%Chichen> You can solo the boss lol
[0:34:28] <%RealThiele> 100%
[0:34:29] <%DeRedBaron> their main thing i've noticed is that its about them not taking damage at all due to TBN but it dont really work out sometimes
[0:34:33] <%VictorVonLouche> You might just solo it with full moon gear
[0:34:39] <%JoshManVGH> @sverisageadvice yeah I felt bad the few dungeons I ran with DRK, i felt like I was punishing the healer
[0:34:39] <Gloppie> Warriors can straight up solo current dungeon content lol
[0:34:41] <%legendfather_of_giants> @JohnAtDawn no, but it got nerfed and shares a cooldown with carve&spit
[0:34:44] <%Alazull> PLD has heals on their aoe magic attacks, DRK should get heals on their aoe rotation if they don't already and if they do the potency should be increased
[0:34:44] <+2DSuperiority> holy shit
[0:34:45] <%Dianaillumani> No not SANTA!!!!
[0:34:48] <%DeRedBaron> also abyssal drain isn't really that good of a sustain in the long term, so no the dydin't take it out
[0:34:49] <KeiPrime> OhMyDog
[0:34:52] <%RealThiele> RIP Santa
[0:34:56] <%JoshManVGH> It got better with slower pulls.
[0:34:57] <%UvBenServed> SANTA psaDogchamp
[0:34:57] <%RoeDeerRootie> warrior heal is so good that tank and my DNC got through over half a final dungeon boss on our own
[0:34:58] <@CreepyPorpoise> ok
[0:35:02] <%JohnAtDawn> Yes?
[0:35:05] <@PrefectusCorgi> Yes
[0:35:05] <%afronooch> no
[0:35:05] <+Melthius36> what?
[0:35:05] <AllenDeadman> yes
[0:35:06] <@SpaceCapnCrone> you can heal me tho
[0:35:06] <%Tarage> Don't heal him at all.
[0:35:07] <%afronooch> muted
[0:35:08] <%JoshManVGH> If this works that's great
[0:35:11] <%VictorVonLouche> yes

[0:36:03] <%Alazull> This is going to go well until Pat steps in one of the traps
[0:36:04] <AllenDeadman> permission to glaremage has been granted
[0:36:06] <%valriot> To be fair this boss only has 2 unavoidable aoes
[0:36:10] <ratearth> the big choese
[0:36:14] <%Tarage> Porpoise this is revenge for him mocking your twitte
[0:36:18] <%RealThiele> can also use glint to heal the party LUL
[0:36:21] <+Melthius36> these are the ones that handle all the probing
[0:36:37] <+Fetrigon> Are most dungeons linear like this?
[0:36:41] <+Plaguemelon> StinkyCheese
[0:36:51] <%Alazull> It also helps that Pat's DPS got that big pump going
[0:36:52] <%Tarage> All dungeons are linear.
[0:36:53] <%RealThiele> yea most dungeons are pretty straight forward
[0:37:00] <%SuckerPunchSyd> PogChamp
[0:37:02] <Calamity2007> This boss was funny
[0:37:04] <%JoshManVGH> 50% Glare mage still glaring, tank still tanking.
[0:37:19] <+orochiblood> they did some non linear dungeons in ARR and those suck
[0:37:19] <%valriot> LUL LUL
[0:37:44] <%mostdumbname> I really love this dungeon. The expansion needed something light-hearted and fun
[0:37:51] <%VictorVonLouche> WAR is so getting a nerf lol
[0:37:52] <%RealThiele> lol. lmao
[0:37:53] <@PrefectusCorgi> MRD no need of Healer
[0:37:55] <%zarkazeon> I was just talking to my roommate about that the other day. I th8nk DRK should only us3 HP as their resourc3 and every 9ne of their skills should have s9me type of regen based on damage dealt.
[0:38:05] <+WRATHZOG> This is silly
[0:38:06] <Koopardon> Koopardon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:38:13] <%Fenrirlives> wait is that guy called Big Cheese holy crap lmao
[0:38:14] <+Fetrigon> So they playerbase is okay with linear dungeons? There's no calls for adding elements of exploration?
[0:38:17] <%Tarage> This is illegal.
[0:38:20] <+Fetrigon> *the
[0:38:27] <%SuckerPunchSyd> LETS GOOO
[0:38:28] <Calamity2007> I am glad I changed to WAR
[0:38:31] <+Melthius36> i knew the moon was made of cheese
[0:38:33] <+Kavtech> @fetrigon No, not really
[0:38:37] <%Tarage> Not in dungeons no. Exploration is for zones. Dungeons are for griiind.
[0:38:38] <%DeRedBaron> it was slightly like that for ARR and it was miserable, at lesat for me
[0:38:40] <KeiPrime> guess im leveling war
[0:38:40] <%RealThiele> if you want to explore thats what all the sightseeing logs and vistas and jump puzzles are fo
[0:38:43] <+Kyma1020> UNGA THAT BUNGA MONKE
[0:38:49] <%Alazull> @fetrigon They had less linear dungeons in the past and it kinda sucked tbh
[0:38:53] <Calamity2007> I keep forgetting, what is the WAR skill that prevents you from being moved by attacks?
[0:38:56] <%JoshManVGH> WAR and PLD seem unstoppable, DRK is Brittle DPS Tank, where does GNB sit on the list?
[0:39:00] <+KawaiiJetty> If you were not coninced to play War in ShB, now you do in EW, simple lol
[0:39:01] <%xephhq> psaDown

[0:39:03] <Ethrion> you might as well have WIPED pat
[0:39:03] <+the22cstomp> @PatStaresAt i had a warrior in stigmascape who never needed my healing once, warrior is so overtuned for dungeons LUL
[0:39:09] <%JoshManVGH> Thst fucking insane
[0:39:09] <@CreepyPorpoise> now try it on mobs
[0:39:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> so in this game...does your armor and stuff matter? like can I make myself look cool and still have proper protection
[0:39:16] <AllenDeadman> WAR everybody
[0:39:17] <%Amadeusguy> Man, as a dark knight main, this is so frustrating
[0:39:19] <%Double_Tap_That> LUL
[0:39:21] <+Kavtech> @fetrigon People like optimising dungeons and doing them really cleanly, and that'd kind ago against taht
[0:39:30] <%RealThiele> i mean Raw intuition and holmgang can keep you alive for a looong time
[0:39:31] <KeiPrime> you can make armor look like other armor but it does matter
[0:39:31] <Saltmeisterr> @TurtlesAndTentacles Theres glam armor so yes
[0:39:32] <%legendfather_of_giants> pretty sure only WAR can do THAT
[0:39:34] <+the22cstomp> @TurtlesAndTentacles you can glamour over gear
[0:39:35] <+Kavtech> @TurtlesAndTentacles You can glamour over your armour to look like anything
[0:39:35] <+BlubRobe> @Calamity2007 Probably thinking of Holmgang, but it doesn't lock you in place anymore. Just stops you from dying.
[0:39:35] <%JoshManVGH> GNB can do that!?
[0:39:35] <%Tarage> GIEF
[0:39:37] <KeiPrime> what you have on, not what it lookslike
[0:39:38] <%VictorVonLouche> Dunno about gun though
[0:39:40] <Tracazoid> When everyone's broken, nobody's broken. Dark Knight isn't broken.
[0:39:42] <+Fetrigon> ah ok. that makes sense.
[0:39:43] <BobbyHopp> nah pld is fine with healing tbh
[0:39:46] <+Melthius36> i heard DRK knight wrecks extremes though
[0:39:49] <+Kyma1020> I cry for Drk
[0:39:52] <TurtlesAndTentacles> oh that's cool!
[0:39:55] <%VictorVonLouche> GNB healing is too slow and low though right?
[0:39:56] <%valriot> But Abyssal Drain Pat :)
[0:39:56] <%JohnAtDawn> Yeah Pat go do that on GNB for us, show us
[0:40:01] <+Mr_ZombieFetish> I can duo lvl 87 dungeon with a dps as PLD. The sustain is crazy
[0:40:04] <%Tarage> Now what
[0:40:16] <%RealThiele> if you have a healer you can trust you can DRK and do more dmg than other tanks but then your healer is losing DPS to heal you
[0:40:18] <%DeRedBaron> if you do a kind of exploring thing for dungeons you NEED to have the entire party on board with the idea, but that wont happy in duty finder so its not really good to design that way
[0:40:19] <%CzeekyTV> IIRC DRK can just pad all their cleaves on adds, doesn't really help clear but it does boost DPS
[0:40:19] <+Fetrigon> Thank you so much guys!
[0:40:20] <KeiPrime> theres limitations like you can only glamour  what your class could wear
[0:40:23] <Calamity2007> @Tracazoid There always has to be someone to bear the suffering

[0:45:11] <%dankjerri> quick question is this msq stuff or am i good?
[0:45:17] <%Agami23> with paladin the best time to use hallowed ground is right before a tank buster that you shirk onto a DPS and use cover on them to put the fear of god in them

[0:50:11] <%RealThiele> he goin many place

[0:55:58] <%CalderGaming> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[0:56:00] <%dankjerri> the orb
[0:56:02] <%hoodedlefty> pat is are you not counting Kardia heals
[0:56:02] <Calamity2007> It is that one metal eye from Dread
[0:56:09] <%dankjerri> just flash him
[0:56:15] <DioTheLiar> Take kardia off no balls :)
[0:56:28] <%Rumbutt> yeah he could put the kardia on a dps
[0:56:35] <%valriot> The shield is just so he can proc Toxicon for movement
[0:56:36] <Calamity2007> It is interesting that they made this a good enemy summoner boss
[0:56:38] <%Koopardon> You GOTTA have your lab partner!
[0:56:43] <%dankjerri> war, sge, rdm will prog this game very hard
[0:56:43] <%VictorVonLouche> Kardia is like 0.5% hp heals
[0:56:43] <+orochiblood> hey its Ligma
[0:56:46] <+Melthius36> i would be nervous running dungeons with the pat
[0:56:52] <%hoodedlefty> could give it to reaper for lols
[0:56:53] <BobbyHopp> hey pat just soloed the last boss of the story 90 dungeon on PLD felt like crack
[0:57:00] <%Koopardon> For emotional support
[0:57:04] <%CzeekyTV> Kardia is just SCH fairy's Embrace
[0:57:16] <%dankjerri> ew its an eye
[0:57:20] <%hoodedlefty> oh yeah that is true
[0:57:23] <%dankjerri> i dont like it
[0:57:30] <%CalderGaming> is kardia better or worse than Regen assuming optimal sage DPS?
[0:57:33] <Calamity2007> ROCKETO PUNCH
[0:57:40] <sirtommygunn> Damn this looks sick, can't wait to reach it. Working through Stormblood right no
[0:57:41] <Calamity2007> I love REA
[0:57:50] <%Fidranth> reaper is just stupid fun
[0:57:59] <+the22cstomp> @CalderGaming better because it doesnt require a refresh
[0:58:03] <nipplestheenchilada96> stando power
[0:58:03] <%VictorVonLouche> Kardia feels worse than a regen
[0:58:19] <%dankjerri> ive not touched reaper, and Sage actually makes my brain rot. ill probably just stick to SCH when i have to heal
[0:58:31] <%CzeekyTV> Kardia ticks about as often as Regen, but Regen has higher potency per tick
[0:58:41] <%dankjerri> the fairy responds INSTANTLY its so good
[0:58:42] <%Dakuu75> War can heal other ppl too?
[0:58:42] <@PrefectusCorgi> LUL
[0:58:51] <VioletRosefall> Warrior healing thru the power of ANGRY
[0:58:51] <+the22cstomp> but kardia doesnt need a gcd to refresh itself
[0:58:52] <@CreepyPorpoise> Regen had better be better than Kardia considering sage is supposed to be a shield healer
[0:58:53] <DioTheLiar> You can fit rprs' whole burst into true north its great
[0:58:58] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Kartia needs a point incress
[0:58:58] <+Kyma1020> THE HEALER TANK
[0:59:00] <%CalderGaming> so glad they fixed fairy response
[0:59:01] <sirtommygunn> Is there anything Warrior doesn't do right now
[0:59:01] <ratearth> Fuck blue DPS time for blue healer
[0:59:03] <%NitronStreams> Tank (Healer)
[0:59:07] <+Fetrigon> wait wut
[0:59:09] <%valriot> Karia still decent sustain, but you can buff it directly or with other skills
[0:59:12] <%CzeekyTV> @CreepyPorpoise and Regen requires a GCD to cast
[0:59:13] <%dankjerri> @creepyporpoise hey porpo
[0:59:15] <+orochiblood> GNB has something like that too
[0:59:15] <@SpaceCapnCrone> become green tank
[0:59:16] <@PrefectusCorgi> GNB can do that too
[0:59:20] <@CreepyPorpoise> @dankjerri o/
[0:59:21] <+Fetrigon> LUL
[0:59:23] <%cooldude69xx> I've never seen a game where "warrior" means "back-up healer"
[0:59:25] <Fathuran> Yeah the new mitigation is so so fun to use and is satisfying when you save people with it.
[0:59:28] <Calamity2007> Yeah WAR is getting nerfed next patch LUL
[0:59:37] <%dankjerri> warrior should be every color
[0:59:47] <%Agami23> i hope they dont nerf warrior and just buff everyone else
[0:59:52] <%dankjerri> warrior is unfair
[0:59:54] <+the22cstomp> warrior is absolutely getting tuned down LUL
[0:59:54] <%shurtal> WAR is just built different
[0:59:56] <%Dakuu75> wtf heals do Sam have? Just second wind and bloodbath? and we LOST Merciful eyes. I want a refund
[0:59:56] <@CreepyPorpoise> Gotta wait to see how Savage shakes out, this is casual content
[0:59:59] <%dankjerri> thats why i play it
[0:59:59] <sirtommygunn> might be a little above the intended power level
[1:00:03] <%BinaryFireball> its weird that a warrior can heal
[1:00:07] <VHLW> if warrior's self sustain was nerfed it wouldnt be warrior anymore
[1:00:08] <%hoodedlefty> warrior is blue healer
[1:00:15] <JossyJoestar> they definitely won't because the damage is still kind of low
[1:00:18] <%CzeekyTV> Why would they care about a job being overpowered in anything below Savage
[1:00:23] <+the22cstomp> pat is getting that stockholm syndrome from dark
[1:00:32] <%dankjerri> yes
[1:00:33] <StrangeCoincidence> ff1 warrior had white magic
[1:00:33] <@PrefectusCorgi> DRK will get no love
[1:00:33] <%Alazull> Yes it was
[1:00:33] <%BinaryFireball> i say as someone who doesnt play ff14
[1:00:37] <+2DSuperiority> ye
[1:00:38] <sirtommygunn> Yeah
[1:00:40] <@JustinianKnight> yea I'm probably switching to Reaper for a while, I've heard NIN is clunky at 90 right now
[1:00:42] <%hoodedlefty> yes
[1:00:50] <%Alazull> Nymian Marines
[1:00:51] <@JustinianKnight> but it was my plan anyways
[1:00:57] <TheHotStuven> old FF warriors had small white magics
[1:01:02] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[1:01:04] <%BinaryFireball> wait is a warrior a tank?
[1:01:06] <Calamity2007> I'd rather have every tank be fun than just one job objectively best
[1:01:07] <+SpaceHobo55> feet Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:01:11] <sirtommygunn> They were Knights though
[1:01:11] <%dankjerri> i enjoy playing scholar a lot more this expac
[1:01:19] <%JokerNewby> @PatStaresAt  Have you run the EXs yet?
[1:01:20] <BobbyHopp> I like the theory that plds skills after 70 is them just copying cool shit they saw in the ivalice raids.
[1:01:21] <%TerpanderLux> SourPls
[1:01:22] <+KawaiiJetty> Don't know why they would nerf  Warrior's self sustain now so i just hope they make DRK better instead
[1:01:24] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Radzt-at-Han night music creepy49Porpchamp

[1:01:46] <+SaphronBlackbourne> When item level gets higher could tanks reach 100k HP again
[1:01:47] <Seathts> I thought that changing oblation to an ED and Walking Dead giving a self healing buff so you could heal yourself out of LD would be a great change.
[1:01:49] <@JustinianKnight> I need to finish leveling it
[1:01:49] <%CzeekyTV> @JoshManVGH Mudra has been on the GCD for years now

[1:02:04] <%Alazull> Yo the best part of post MSQ is the Radz-at-Han music
[1:02:06] <@JustinianKnight> Darius finished NIN tho
[1:02:07] <+Makouzer> @PatStaresAt Did you level NIN to 90? if you did how do you feel about it?
[1:02:08] <%hoodedlefty> SCH's jobquest character is literally a marauder
[1:02:09] <Blank9> monk feels pretty good now

[1:03:30] <%furiousfurioso> wait I've been playing summoner and I don't know why you have those arrows
[1:03:32] <%watts121> I will say MCH damage feels way better.

[1:06:08] <jubejube56> okay but can you make them bigger?
[1:06:10] <%retrohazard> the petsize command should work on a client level, so others around you can downsize your summons even if you want big giants
[1:06:10] <+REDtheBEAST> Titan is just a Roe in a titan costume LUL
[1:06:13] <%TerpanderLux> the small demi summons are cute
[1:06:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> CHIMKEN NUGGET TITAN

[1:10:12] <%Rumbutt> madness Pat
[1:10:15] <%Chichen> yah.
[1:10:16] <%Dakuu75> WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT to yourself lol
[1:10:17] <%TerpanderLux> you lost life force doing that
[1:10:20] <%dankjerri> i made a full femroe with an actual roe name to be a bard and i just switched to war so my queue times for Endwalker were shorter lol
[1:10:21] <@JustinianKnight> wow 50 reaper is boring
[1:10:22] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat that was a insane idea
[1:10:23] <%JoshManVGH> How many times?
[1:10:36] <MechanizedGentleman> tiny gun for tiny man
[1:10:38] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I forgot how to play MCH
[1:10:43] <stoatacious> 50 reaper sucks
[1:10:48] <%JoshManVGH> LUL
[1:10:51] <%Dakuu75> dude...
[1:10:51] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I remember it being EZ tho
[1:10:53] <%dankjerri> i want like a snub nose pistol

[1:11:10] <%Birdigalore> I'm partial to the matte version of the Bozja gun.
[1:11:13] <+Makouzer> Did you clear the extremes yet? @PatStaresAt
[1:11:14] <%JoshManVGH> @marusux Cryptlueker
[1:11:15] <RonessaSeabreeze> 420 lets gooo
[1:11:17] <%Chichen> KEKHeim
[1:11:20] <%Fidranth> enshroud is like crack, anything lower on reaper feels terrible
[1:11:44] <hexen_emma> Oh shit, new jump puzzles sign me up?
[1:11:50] <%dankjerri> Pat likes to flex
[1:11:55] <%dankjerri> thats it thats the reason
[1:11:58] <Fathuran> Oh I didn't know there were ones in Radz and Empyreum. Will have to be something to do while I cope with Chi spawn LUL
[1:12:01] <TheeRabbi> I don't like MMOs, but I enjoyed Guild Wars 2 for a bit mainly because I loved jumping puzzles, and it had SO MANY
[1:12:03] <eelwoman> Ones that usually go to a point are pretty difficult
[1:12:03] <%TerpanderLux> did heat blast always have that bigass fireball?
[1:12:14] <%Giantsuperguy> whats the name of that mkachinist gun
[1:12:19] <%TerpanderLux> jermaPluto
[1:12:19] <+Fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL
[1:12:21] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I have never seen anyone pull the mobs over to the back here

[1:12:29] <%Guardiansaiyan> Nice
[1:12:31] <Shiibbae> Dark souls crafter
[1:12:37] <%Fidranth> you should've made cool weapons for the people that reached the top
[1:12:38] <%Rumbutt> yeyeye
[1:12:43] <azure_dunes> so it's to be an asshole
[1:12:51] <@JustinianKnight> same
[1:12:52] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Why does the stream description say "Job Quests"? I though there were no new job quests this patch, only role quests.
[1:12:54] <%JoshManVGH> @giantsuperguy Not sure but if you google Cryptlurker MCH it will come up
[1:12:56] <Arqartur0> I feel my adhd would kill me in this, kinda like back in the days of DDO and Neverwinter.
[1:12:59] <%Alazull> Old MCH sucks
[1:13:01] <Ahack13> remember gun-caster?
[1:13:01] <MechanizedGentleman> StB MCH was trash
[1:13:05] <Ahack13> that shit sucked
[1:13:05] <%JoshManVGH> BUT BULLETS PAT! THE THEME!
[1:13:10] <%Alazull> Oh hey let's sit around trying to fish a proc
[1:13:15] <%RealThiele> love the gun Magnatus its a small pistol
[1:13:16] <%dankjerri> the cryptluker aiming armor is however quite bad
[1:13:20] <%dankjerri> it looks bad
[1:13:20] <+kylejefferies> Hey Pat, do you think Erenville got so much play because of how unbelievably hot he is, or because he is gonna show us the island sanctuary in 6.1?
[1:13:21] <+Fetrigon> @arqartur0 how so?
[1:13:23] <%MidnightBurst12> ain't nothing wrong with a little flexing
[1:13:24] <Saltmeisterr> now machinist has ROBOT
[1:13:25] <%BinaryFireball> i dont think pat
[1:13:26] <%marusux> I thought you didn‚Äôt like Machinist at all.
[1:13:27] <+the22cstomp> yes
[1:13:30] <%TerpanderLux> no
[1:13:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yes
[1:13:31] <@PrefectusCorgi> Always
[1:13:31] <%Rumbutt> yes
[1:13:31] <%Visorak6> yes
[1:13:32] <Srthunda> ya
[1:13:37] <+RelikaNox> Always
[1:13:37] <%JoshManVGH> Required
[1:13:37] <%JohnAtDawn> SET UP A BET
[1:13:37] <championofsomeone> no
[1:13:38] <+HelloImTom08> yes
[1:13:38] <Fathuran> @Giantsuperguy It's the cryptlurker arm, so you can get it for tomestones in Eulmore
[1:13:38] <%afronooch> lemme see how this one goes and we'll know
[1:13:39] <%DianaTheAscian> Possibly
[1:13:40] <%dankjerri> once
[1:13:41] <Shiibbae> heavenlySmug
[1:13:43] <+Fetrigon> I never think :)
[1:13:45] <%hoodedlefty> yes
[1:13:46] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Maybe
[1:13:46] <%TerpanderLux> wait if they fuck atomos up then maybe
[1:13:46] <%afronooch> GAMBA
[1:13:46] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> i hope
[1:13:47] <%BinaryFireball> why it hard?
[1:13:48] <Srthunda> people have been bad about that recently
[1:13:48] <%Double_Tap_That> of course, it's tradition
[1:13:48] <Bardemis> 100%
[1:13:48] <%rekinom> Gotta commit to the kill
[1:13:52] <+BIumen> die to atomos
[1:13:55] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt I'm gonna guess you'll have to shout at someone to stand on the pads in this next area
[1:13:57] <%cooldude69xx> THE MOST PASSAGE ON TWITCH
[1:13:57] <%JoshManVGH> PUG must wipe to ancient flare
[1:13:59] <%TerpanderLux> LOL
[1:14:00] <stoatacious> make sure to write D A B before the next boss
[1:14:04] <%VictorVonLouche> it's possible lol
[1:14:05] <%dankjerri> ive only died to Flare once
[1:14:07] <%CzeekyTV> game theory in action
[1:14:07] <+BlubRobe> But if enough people greed we can make it!
[1:14:08] <@PrefectusCorgi> Run back
[1:14:12] <+Pukenasty> i would be suprised if you did
[1:14:13] <+Plaguemelon> 2 flares are for cowards
[1:14:14] <@PrefectusCorgi> thats it
[1:14:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Well, and the tank actually has to pull the boss off the center panel
[1:14:18] <%Chichen> going to the store was a mistake this queue sucks
[1:14:19] <%SuckerPunchSyd> People get too greedy
[1:14:21] <%BinaryFireball> oh that sounds ok lol :D
[1:14:21] <%afronooch> I die to it from greed every now and then lol
[1:14:23] <TheeRabbi> All you have to do is not die. Easy
[1:14:24] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Only 10% of my runs have ever done that
[1:14:25] <%TerpanderLux> oh no
[1:14:26] <%marusux> @patstaresat How do you feel about Machinist in general?
[1:14:29] <+RelikaNox> People always think they can greed it. Narrator voice: They could not
[1:14:30] <%BinaryFireball> just do that then
[1:14:33] <Fathuran> The greeeed
[1:14:41] <%HotSauceFiend> are there bosses or enemies in this game that you find challenging even with your strongest character?
[1:14:48] <Psyramics> you can if your group is full of Gamers, bu its labyrinth so probably not
[1:14:58] <%CzeekyTV> wow your team let the adds through
[1:14:59] <%dankjerri> but BARD tho
[1:15:02] <%JoshManVGH> And a shotgun!
[1:15:04] <%valriot> Bard is alot better right now
[1:15:06] <%JoshManVGH> And a Drill!
[1:15:07] <%Fidranth> it has a drill and a shotgun so it's cool I guess
[1:15:08] <@JustinianKnight> I like MCH cuz hit many button fast
[1:15:08] <+Plaguemelon> Scattergun is so satisfying to use
[1:15:11] <MechanizedGentleman> MCH has a shotgun now, making it the best job
[1:15:13] <%Double_Tap_That> also GUN
[1:15:15] <BobbyHopp> drill cool
[1:15:16] <%TerpanderLux> im one of the psychos that like bard
[1:15:17] <%JoshManVGH> AND A CHAINSAAAAAW
[1:15:27] <+Kyma1020> And a gun that shoots chains and buzz saws
[1:15:29] <Saltmeisterr> wait aiming classes?
[1:15:38] <MechanizedGentleman> it's not a chainsaw it's a buzzsaw launcher DansGam
[1:15:44] <%dankjerri> @boxnavy tbat was my first ever job i think, back in HW i think?
[1:15:53] <%Fidranth> wildfire used to be good
[1:15:54] <@JustinianKnight> its not much different than other dps things
[1:15:59] <dr_sweets> The Edgar FFVI Job
[1:16:04] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> yeah wildfire is pretty lame
[1:16:07] <%JoshManVGH> Heatblast
[1:16:09] <%dankjerri> @saltmeisterr ranged physical, dancer machinist and bard
[1:16:13] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[1:16:16] <%BinaryFireball> man thanatos just cant get ahead in the world it seems
[1:16:17] <%Rumbutt> that's a lot of buttons in 14 Pat
[1:16:21] <%Birdigalore> BUT FLAMETHROWER THO
[1:16:25] <%CzeekyTV> wildfire + hypercharge is the "i hope you live next to the data center" combo
[1:16:26] <%valriot> LUL
[1:16:29] <%Birdigalore> Never forget flamethrower
[1:16:30] <%Rumbutt> hit it before you do your burst, hit it during your burst, etc
[1:16:32] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> the SCH
[1:16:37] <%Guardiansaiyan> wow
[1:16:42] <%marusux> @patstaresat Understood, yeah MCH has been my main forever. Wildfire is very useless, but having 2 Reassembles is nice
[1:16:55] <stoatacious> that rescue sound is terrifying
[1:16:58] <%dankjerri> just like Ninja
[1:17:09] <Psyramics> i stopped playing MCH because of that. now i play the better rphys job, SMN
[1:17:15] <%valriot> Reaper straight up has a better Hypercharge
[1:17:20] <%HotSauceFiend> so are there contribution bonuses for ther ewards in these raids? Like if you just idle the whole time and your team winswhat happens
[1:17:20] <%TerpanderLux> at least new summoner is basically a physical ranged job now
[1:17:25] <@JustinianKnight> true
[1:17:45] <%Rumbutt> Okay so we think you'll die to ancient flare, what about ecliptic meteor?
[1:17:47] <+SpaceHobo55> Those assholes Kappa
[1:17:49] <+HelloImTom08> fuck that lamp
[1:17:53] <%TerpanderLux> lamp bad
[1:17:54] <%CzeekyTV> reaper's "hypercharge" is incredibly flexible too
[1:18:01] <%dankjerri> gief, play game
[1:18:04] <RonessaSeabreeze> fuck the lamp
[1:18:05] <+Melthius36> have you found any differences in difficulty since the stat squish?
[1:18:08] <ratearth> he hates lamp
[1:18:08] <+Fetrigon> get that lamp PunOko
[1:18:10] <%Birdigalore> The lamp is a mimic!
[1:18:10] <%RealThiele> lamps haunted
[1:18:14] <%Rumbutt> you get better labs then me then oroLUL
[1:18:17] <%JoshManVGH> It's when the meteors drop too close to the blast zone that there are problems
[1:18:17] <%Durahand> i feel like there's been a few runs i've been in where people place rocks too close to behem tho
[1:18:18] <+SpaceHobo55> splash in lava
[1:18:20] <%TerpanderLux> dance in the lava if ur cool
[1:18:24] <MechanizedGentleman> Aimer
[1:18:24] <Treasure_Vault> reamer
[1:18:25] <%afronooch> AIMer
[1:18:25] <+Sydite> the real LotA shenanigans is wiping right here
[1:18:25] <%DianaTheAscian> Words
[1:18:25] <%JohnAtDawn> Pat are you okay?
[1:18:35] <DrStinkers> gun reaper
[1:18:40] <+WeLucklessJacks> BORK AT THE LAMP
[1:18:45] <@SpaceCapnCrone> everyone's favorite job, Aimeric
[1:18:48] <%Chichen> im really not a fan of MCH
[1:18:58] <%JoshManVGH> It's boring to use it on a combo finisher
[1:19:09] <+FZeroDMX> I literally fell asleep while playing Syrcus yesterday. I woke up at Xande half health
[1:19:16] <%HotSauceFiend> just a question to audience. Does King Tonberry exist in ff14 in any form? It's my fav character
[1:19:17] <@PrefectusCorgi> Whooo
[1:19:18] <%TerpanderLux> woooow moon2W
[1:19:20] <%marusux> Chainsaw is just Drill but attacks all enemies in a straight line. Kinda neat but really nothing crazy
[1:19:21] <%FunkyStreams> thats a clean shot
[1:19:26] <Raz_Pataz> I can't wait for oceanic servers so I can play MCH properly
[1:19:32] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah 300 potency crit wooo mild number
[1:19:33] <%RealThiele> reassumbled drill Kreygasm
[1:19:34] <%dankjerri> @hotsaucefiend wanderers palace
[1:19:37] <%valriot> MCHs design feels really flat to me
[1:19:37] <+FZeroDMX> @hotsaucefiend in a dungeon I think
[1:19:37] <Psyramics> yes, there is a point where reassemble on clean shot is better than hot shot
[1:19:42] <%TerpanderLux> yes
[1:19:45] <%afronooch> idk lol
[1:19:58] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Why does the stream description say "Job Quests"? I though you had completed all the job quests before EW & that there were no new job quests this patch, only role quests.
[1:20:05] <%JoshManVGH> Possibly but I'm sure streaming traffic slows things down in some reguard
[1:20:06] <%TerpanderLux> could check your battle log
[1:20:28] <%Alazull> If only you had a log running in the background to review later
[1:20:29] <+BlubRobe> @OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels Reaper and Sage both have job quests if he decides to do them
[1:20:37] <@ssjklyco> just pretend you aren't streaming and see if you notice
[1:20:40] <%valriot> The fact that Queen/Rook don't do AOE, Drill has AOE option but Air Anchor doesn't, Wildfire/Charge feels meh. its kinda lame
[1:21:00] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> @OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels Ah! That explains it, thanks!
[1:21:03] <%JoshManVGH> @openyoureels4thenextfeels I think he means the Role Quests.

[1:21:45] <%RealThiele> Magnatus from castrum bania is best pistol

[1:23:43] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL

[1:24:01] <+projectmanatees> Aw no greed
[1:24:07] <%TerpanderLux> which is insane
[1:24:09] <%CzeekyTV> psaUp
[1:24:09] <+Moaradin> get xivalexander
[1:24:09] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Clap for the raid for making he right decision there
[1:24:14] <VioletHeart> Yeah I feel like my UK ping on a US server makes Machinist borderline unplayable
[1:24:26] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> what data center region are you in?
[1:24:27] <+wizard_of_diamonds> No commendation? :<
[1:24:38] <%VioletHeart> VioletHeart subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 40 months! 
[1:24:39] <%Chichen> pat doesnt commend? No dignity.
[1:24:44] <+projectmanatees> creepy49Uhhh no comms
[1:24:50] <%TerpanderLux> pull up your battle chat log just to make sure
[1:24:53] <+zenraider> confused
[1:25:04] <RonessaSeabreeze> ELMO
[1:25:10] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Quebec is like East of Canada?
[1:25:11] <Raz_Pataz> you could try delaying your hypercharge input towards then end of your gcd cooldown?
[1:25:14] <Treasure_Vault> how many chrome tabs are open
[1:25:19] <+Moaradin> xivalexander pretty much gives you ping as if you're right next to the server
[1:25:25] <%Mendin> Quebec is the Ohio of Canada
[1:25:35] <%BinaryFireball> machinist can summon robot man???
[1:25:39] <Raz_Pataz> it really is
[1:25:40] <%BinaryFireball> cool
[1:25:40] <%Mendin> wait no, that's Ontario, sorry
[1:25:41] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I only just now noticed Patron's last name. Nice reference
[1:25:41] <+Nomenanza> oh yeah you wanna do hypercharge same way as you did Inner release back in ShB
[1:25:44] <%TerpanderLux> ya
[1:25:46] <%CzeekyTV> hypercharge > heat blast > wildfire > heat blasts is an option
[1:25:49] <%Kise77> yeah you wanna time it similar to old inner release where it's almost cd to try and activate it
[1:26:00] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> yes MCH can summon da queen
[1:26:17] <%Birdigalore> Just stack SKS Kappa
[1:26:26] <theanora1> Hey Pat are you planning to do the  basic yellow quests?
[1:26:37] <Psyramics> yeah, you pop it in the second half of your gcd
[1:26:40] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> just delay 4Head
[1:27:04] <Raz_Pataz> the fact you have to micromanage it like that makes it less fun I find
[1:27:09] <%Kise77> it's very much the carpel tunnel class if you have mouse buttons / click player
[1:27:12] <%valriot> Wait did MCH not get the same GCD stack changes? LUL
[1:27:12] <+zenraider> im so confused but it looks pretty
[1:27:19] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I can't believe the robot pilebunkers the enemy PogChamp
[1:27:23] <+Nomenanza> I actually like the stack system on IR less now. It kinda feels less feral now
[1:27:28] <%Mendin> 's why they're great dance partners, so many button presses = BIG ESPRIT
[1:27:29] <stoatacious> would have been cool to give it charges like new delirium or requiescat
[1:27:29] <MechanizedGentleman> playing MCH and then switching to a job that doesn't double-weave ResidentSleeper
[1:27:32] <%valriot> DRK and MCH, throw em in the garbage
[1:27:45] <Raz_Pataz> reaper makes my brain tingle
[1:27:54] <ohno778> DRK has big dick damage now
[1:27:56] <%Fidranth> Enshroud is best skill
[1:27:57] <%BinaryFireball> wait... wasnt that lvl50 a second ago?
[1:28:02] <%TerpanderLux> FeelsGoodMan
[1:28:04] <%Mendin> Did she fall dow
[1:28:07] <%BinaryFireball> or was that another job?
[1:28:10] <+FZeroDMX> Reaper is big fun
[1:28:10] <%CzeekyTV> landing a direct hit critical Communio gives the good chemicals
[1:28:12] <%Deft_Thought> Feels reaper, man
[1:28:12] <+Nomenanza> RPR feels good and pretty much now THE easiest melee to play
[1:28:22] <%Mendin> Reaper starts at 70 so I dont know how it becomes 51
[1:28:24] <Raz_Pataz> enshroud gcd speed is satisfying as hell
[1:28:30] <bubgerpants> mch not getting the stack/timer change that the tanks got is like, baffling to me given that it's the job that is arguably the most reliant on landing them
[1:28:33] <%Mendin> No dungeon would synch to that
[1:28:35] <%afronooch> @BinaryFireball raids sync you to a specific level. That raid was 50
[1:28:38] <+Mrbaconator> cool
[1:28:56] <ohno778> The only thing i don't like about RPR is babysitting that debuff
[1:29:03] <%Deft_Thought> That was slick
[1:29:05] <+BlubRobe> Go crazy! Go stupid!
[1:29:09] <+Plaguemelon> what am I looking at LUL
[1:29:17] <%TerpanderLux> hells ingress is the best dude
[1:29:20] <+Nomenanza> Enshroud is kinda what I wanted new Inner release to be honestly
[1:29:21] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> wait until you get the 90 skill
[1:29:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i have no idea what just happened but it looks cool
[1:29:25] <%rekinom> Wait till you get the ogcd for sicko mode @PatStaresAt
[1:29:30] <%Fidranth> Communio is the best finisher
[1:29:31] <Raz_Pataz> I keep forgetting to pop harvest moon before combat LUL
[1:29:35] <+badhaye> lvl 90 is nuts
[1:29:37] <+Nomenanza> also yeah you WILL die losing yourself in a mess that is reaper's vfx
[1:29:43] <@JustinianKnight> harvest moon is so weird
[1:29:47] <+Kyma1020> Where's the aoe buttons?
[1:29:48] <+Melthius36> hammer time
[1:29:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 5 minutes from Chi?
[1:29:53] <%CzeekyTV> reaper is really back-loaded on the fun stuff, synching down with it is a snooze fest
[1:29:54] <%TerpanderLux> oh no moon2W
[1:29:56] <+Plaguemelon> Pain
[1:29:57] <%valriot> LUL LUL
[1:29:58] <%animaturgy> The only part of reaper I don't like it keeping the damage buff stacked
[1:30:07] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> oh no
[1:30:07] <Ethrion> what the heck do you even get for maxing all of those out
[1:30:14] <Nordguy> have you peeped the treasure maps?
[1:30:15] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong
[1:30:15] <%Durahand> put in a twitch stream in ur 2nd monitor lol
[1:30:16] <+Nomenanza> Harvest moon is pretty much there for when you can't hit the boss in melee or pulling trash
[1:30:16] <Raz_Pataz> it's not so bad, the final zone has nice music at least coxSmile
[1:30:17] <%jingokrieg> Holy shit I think I'll make it to endwalker soon, got 3 arcs left of post SHB @PatStaresAt
[1:30:18] <%valriot> I've already got Rank 3 in 3 zones
[1:30:18] <%afronooch> FATEs were giving me like 250k per
[1:30:20] <+FZeroDMX> Chi waiting room RyuChamp
[1:30:20] <%animaturgy> The abilities looks cool but they feel kind of bar cluttering
[1:30:29] <%afronooch> 250K exp that is
[1:30:34] <%TerpanderLux> wait for chi B)
[1:30:36] <+zenraider> that health bar is satisfying 33333
[1:30:40] <bubgerpants> @animaturgy yeah, i kinda wish using gluttony or entering/exiting shroud would have a trait that re-ups your buff
[1:30:45] <@JustinianKnight> yeah
[1:30:51] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> cries in crystal
[1:30:53] <%Mendin> As a reaper it should be 44444
[1:30:56] <%RealThiele> Labyrinthos sucks for fate grinding
[1:30:59] <+Plaguemelon> I got 3/6 and wanna die
[1:31:08] <@JustinianKnight> guess I do NIN
[1:31:08] <%CzeekyTV> @burgerpantsed re-upping the buff within shroud is an optimization tech tho
[1:31:09] <+Huderga> any chi boys?
[1:31:19] <@CreepyPorpoise> time for me to go out and finish fates too
[1:31:20] <cherrycottontail> @RealThiele but you need the orchestration tho
[1:31:20] <Raz_Pataz> does the enochian change make BLM more appealing for you?
[1:31:40] <+Nomenanza> @JustinianKnight boy I have not heard good stuff about forked raiju of NIN
[1:31:40] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.

[1:32:37] <@CreepyPorpoise> you can also use /instance to find out which one you're in if you forget
[1:32:37] <%SveriSageAdvice> either Aetheryte or the entrance of a zone
[1:32:39] <+Huderga> i learned that recently too
[1:32:39] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Yeah thae fates in endwalker zones spawn times are wack atm
[1:32:41] <%walternatorz> not big into hunts?
[1:32:41] <%Saunt> type /instance to see what one you are in incase you forget
[1:32:43] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I'm now 2,800 in que to log in. Send help :(
[1:32:45] <Treasure_Vault> It's okay if you don't know things, this game seems big
[1:32:46] <%CzeekyTV> fate groups i've been joining absolutely hate instance hopping when fates aren't spawning for some reason? they would rather just sit and wait
[1:32:46] <%Divryne> Lol how were you doing hunt trains these few weeks? LUL
[1:32:47] <Daniel_Is_I> Aetheryte -> Travel to instanced area
[1:32:47] <cherrycottontail> command squad good for leveling 30-50 dps classes
[1:32:55] <Ahack13> I mean, its not something you need to know for 95% of an expansions lifecycle
[1:32:58] <%TerpanderLux> do you even get anything cool for maxing shared fates
[1:32:58] <%BlueLunecy> Yeah but it was free
[1:33:00] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Pat Embraces his bunny boy self

[1:34:40] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Has Pat gotten his firebird yet?

[1:38:03] <%Mendin> My friend have you heard of "THE DPS QUEUE"
[1:38:10] <Treasure_Vault> It's not the worst yet, but we've got top men on it
[1:38:12] <%Dakuu75> don't sleep, don't eat, don't fuck, and only breathe when ABSOLUTELY necessary
[1:38:12] <Psyramics> bozja XP does not scale up to 90, it stops scaling at 80, but its still a real healthy amount

[1:38:36] <@JustinianKnight> theyre very slow
[1:38:39] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt you can transfer instances instead of waiting if they take forever to spawn more.
[1:38:41] <%bravebravesrobin> bullshit, Cyberpunk or Steampunk for life
[1:38:42] <+Melthius36> party finder farming
[1:38:46] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt fates are rare everwhere rn for me too
[1:38:49] <%mostdumbname> Do you not get something fun to buy with the gems?

[1:38:52] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Fuck normql cyberpunk I want Blood Dragon's 2007
[1:38:52] <%RealThiele> this zone  is just bad for fates
[1:38:55] <Daniel_Is_I> Dragon Kart is PRETTY GOOD

[1:39:09] <%RealThiele> @mostdumbname music and housing deco
[1:39:10] <+Fetrigon> @agami23 I don't believe that's real. it's too stupid LUL
[1:39:12] <%Agami23> was voxelious in more than one?
[1:39:12] <+sonofthedeepsouth> He will say 5 Kappa
[1:39:21] <%HotSauceFiend> wait or was that yakuza 5 saejima hunting
[1:39:28] <%TerpanderLux> no
[1:39:37] <+TheEldritch0ne> I had to run downstairs to grab laundry and as I walked into my room I saw myself get timed out of FF lytNOTIKETHIS
[1:39:39] <+SeventhVice> The fates in Labyrinthos suck. It‚Äôs also a deceptively huge zone
[1:39:39] <%RealThiele> can you tho
[1:39:43] <+Nomenanza> Doing these fates as WAR is just silly. You never die
[1:39:45] <%Agami23> @fetrigon its real. its NFTs that make your character stronger too. they are calling it "a metahuman NFT system"
[1:39:48] <%Chichen> Pat did you see theres a mount you buy with 50k bicolored gemstones? It costs 500 vouchers that cost 100 bicolors each. @PatStaresAt
[1:40:03] <%TerpanderLux> you did it
[1:40:15] <+Melthius36> Riding maps
[1:40:17] <%cooldude69xx> Duty Flufilled?

[1:40:32] <%Chichen> yep.
[1:40:39] <%Nekros4442> just buy dem leather mats
[1:40:39] <%Chichen> not worth at all lmao
[1:40:44] <Zeif00> I just spent mine on mats
[1:40:53] <+Nomenanza> @Daniel_Is_I they are tradable??
[1:40:54] <%Koopardon> Papa Paissa WHEN
[1:41:06] <%Shikari21> rpr is op
[1:41:07] <%RealThiele> Gaja hide and Almasty fur get them crafter gains and money
[1:41:08] <Daniel_Is_I> Yeah they're tradable
[1:41:10] <%Mendin> @Koopardon This is the question of the ages
[1:41:20] <%Mendin> I hope it isnt the P4S mount
[1:41:28] <%roxasth3nobody> @Chichen except you forgot to mention that to even try getting that one must hit lv3 in all areas and then they can spend 100 per voucher for the mount
[1:41:38] <%TerpanderLux> whens the hellfrog medium mount
[1:41:42] <%Nekros4442> Gaja hide isnt great is it? Everyone blasts past it in 2 crafting levels
[1:41:56] <%Mendin> Might be a leve component
[1:42:00] <%Saunt> Shared Fates in Travel
[1:42:00] <%afronooch> shared fate
[1:42:00] <Daniel_Is_I> Shared Fates

[1:42:03] <%shurtal> sharedfate menu
[1:42:07] <%RealThiele> @Nekros4442 i just did gaja hide from 80-90 vis collectibles
[1:42:08] <%Chichen> yep
[1:42:09] <AdmiralButtloaf> i needed over 400 almasty fur for weaver
[1:42:09] <%Chichen> top right
[1:42:10] <%Saunt> Almost max
[1:42:12] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[1:42:15] <%Chichen> because painu
[1:42:16] <Zeif00> spend ur stonez son
[1:42:18] <+ALazo> I know they don't matter, but those exclamation points stress me out
[1:42:25] <ape_hawk> did pat finish Arcane yet or has he been on the FF14 grindset?
[1:42:33] <studleydoorite> Pat got the horsey mount sweet
[1:42:44] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> get the crafting mats and ether use them or sell them
[1:42:51] <%TerpanderLux> hehe
[1:42:55] <+Kyma1020> Dorsey
[1:43:03] <%RealThiele> the crafting mats are already dropping like a rock in price
[1:43:10] <%Nekros4442> @realthiele that seems...inefficient. LTW is like the biggest candidate to level through levy and custom delivery.
[1:43:16] <%legendfather_of_giants> levelling LTW uses a lot of sklins, NO IT ISNT TO MUCH
[1:43:26] <Buttku> what?? what have you been on?
[1:43:26] <%cooldude69xx> @studleydoorite Of course, of course it's a horse
[1:43:27] <%walternatorz> getting ltw leveled?
[1:43:28] <%Agami23> the leather sells well.
[1:43:29] <%afronooch> save 70 for riding map after you do 6 fates here
[1:43:38] <JossyJoestar> I think the egg economy is still okay, leather is dropping
[1:43:43] <%Koopardon> Oh I'm an idiot, I didn't realize you can buy actually useful mats from the gem trader
[1:43:52] <%TerpanderLux> moon2W
[1:44:01] <%Mendin> Why get a riding map when fl
[1:44:02] <%Koopardon> That's gonna make lvling crafters tons easier and more fun
[1:44:05] <%Mendin> fly, even
[1:44:30] <JossyJoestar> I got all the riding maps as i was doing msq because it takes a while to get flying in some
[1:44:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is there a reason to buy riding maps if you can fly
[1:44:44] <%Nekros4442> they werent lvl 80?
[1:44:46] <%RealThiele> quick exploration spamm
[1:44:50] <Daniel_Is_I> You didn't have your retainers at 80 in ShB?
[1:44:50] <+projectmanatees> It‚Äôs slightly faster
[1:44:57] <+zenraider> what is a retainer
[1:44:59] <%Nekros4442> ah
[1:45:00] <+Nomenanza> retainers sometimes can get some good shit
[1:45:11] <NateyBeak> me in my backyard gardening
[1:45:20] <%Valdorick> Reap 'em all.
[1:45:28] <cherrycottontail> are your retainers all DOW/DOM?
[1:45:28] <+projectmanatees> Retainers got me JB dye easy money
[1:45:28] <+Kyma1020> faster speed
[1:45:29] <Daniel_Is_I> More mobs spawn when there are more people in the zone
[1:45:30] <%RealThiele> venture coffers have such a low drop rate now :(
[1:45:30] <%Nekros4442> yeah aoe fates are the best
[1:45:33] <%Koopardon> My retainers can only bring gaja leather as of right now, and they bring 5 at a time
[1:45:35] <%Koopardon> Suffering
[1:45:36] <Raz_Pataz> this is bozja levels
[1:45:43] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Retainers are gathers/extra storage and they help sell stuff on the player makert bored
[1:45:49] <theanora1> gotta counteract that BLU fate deleting
[1:45:51] <+Nomenanza> these are fine but when it's a mass murder fate with enemies the size of an elephant boy it is rough
[1:46:16] <%animaturgy> it does
[1:46:16] <Daniel_Is_I> I remember that dog and kinda, yeah.
[1:46:16] <%walternatorz> ptsd dog?
[1:46:17] <%legendfather_of_giants> vietnam flashback dog?

[1:46:36] <%TerpanderLux> oh yeah youre right
[1:46:37] <studleydoorite> he reminds me more of the luckdragon in neverending story
[1:46:39] <%rekinom> the dog mounts face is too detailed for me it looks creepy
[1:46:45] <SweetCuppingCake> I thought Minfilia became a dog
[1:46:47] <eelwoman> White woman dog
[1:46:49] <+Kyma1020> Reminds me of that weird Japanese Commercial dog
[1:46:52] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL LUL
[1:46:54] <+projectmanatees> Different dog
[1:46:54] <Saltmeisterr> damn
[1:46:58] <Daniel_Is_I> I'm sad it removes my bunny ears.

[1:47:26] <studleydoorite> this would be hot if these gelatins had boobs
[1:47:26] <Raz_Pataz> I've had scene transitions happen in enshroud and still've managed to get the rest out
[1:47:29] <+J_PewPew> Just DC's in a dungeon, guess ill play tommorow
[1:47:30] <%hoodedlefty> gotta unlock flight in one more zone
[1:47:44] <%Agami23> thats my favorite change to paladin too. no more messing up the timing for requiescat since now its 30 seconds with 5 charges
[1:48:02] <ape_hawk> why is pat fighting giant tide pods?
[1:48:18] <+Fetrigon> bye  :)
[1:48:19] <%RealThiele> pat is saving the kids by killing the tide pods
[1:48:22] <%afronooch> for dinner later
[1:48:23] <studleydoorite> he's saving the children
[1:48:30] <%SatChamp> bc they're delicious
[1:48:37] <%afronooch> get the riding map before you go
[1:48:46] <draca23> Just got my dailies done, and I forgot how simple ARR Trials are...
[1:48:47] <@CreepyPorpoise> Thavnair isn't so bad
[1:48:49] <+Fetrigon> @realthiele kids and influencers
[1:48:53] <%Visorak6> speed
[1:48:59] <+Nomenanza> but you also fly faster with a riding map
[1:49:00] <%DianaTheAscian> Faster
[1:49:01] <@PrefectusCorgi> Fly faster
[1:49:01] <%afronooch> fly faster
[1:49:01] <+Kyma1020> you fly faster
[1:49:01] <@JustinianKnight> to be fast on land
[1:49:05] <General_Terro> so you can have the star
[1:49:05] <@CreepyPorpoise> you WILL have downtime though
[1:49:06] <+Melthius36> Gold stars
[1:49:06] <Srthunda> but walk faster tho
[1:49:09] <@CreepyPorpoise> and yeah, riding maps are worthless
[1:49:09] <%DianaTheAscian> MORE SPEED
[1:49:11] <+Kyma1020> fly faster
[1:49:12] <%Durahand> but completionism
[1:49:14] <%legendfather_of_giants> riding map is land only guys
[1:49:16] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt you can be faster in air too
[1:49:16] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Flying is the same speed as 2 star riding maps
[1:49:17] <DarkSideCow> you fly faster as well
[1:49:18] <KenzBurp> be sanic
[1:49:18] <@JustinianKnight> :)
[1:49:19] <Psyramics> you dont fly faster with a map you nerds
[1:49:26] <%Kise77> have you caught either of the special fates yet?
[1:49:26] <Nordguy> flying is full speed
[1:49:28] <%RealThiele> yea map is land only its mostly for goblins
[1:49:30] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The only maps I ever bought were for Bozja
[1:49:35] <+Nomenanza> same but with gemstones since I am maxed since ShB
[1:49:38] <%afronooch> well it feels like its faster
[1:49:41] <%Birdigalore> Why do riding maps even still exist
[1:49:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lmao at people saying you fly faster
[1:49:50] <%Nekros4442> I saw the fucking Ribbon from getting all the fates to max and im now angry I have to do this bicolour hell
[1:49:50] <Arqartur0> But you WILL make it
[1:49:52] <%hoodedlefty> flying is always like twice max speed
[1:49:52] <%walternatorz> 1!
[1:49:55] <+Fetrigon> LUL
[1:49:56] <%furiousfurioso> I had no idea the maps were ground only
[1:49:57] <%Visorak6> doesnt it only count if gold?
[1:49:58] <+Kyma1020> no
[1:50:01] <General_Terro> only gold counts LUL
[1:50:02] <+Kyma1020> has to be gold
[1:50:06] <%RealThiele> 23k!
[1:50:07] <%CzeekyTV> those zonureskin maps probably were the best spend during the moogle tome event, guaranteed portals, stackable, and their glam is only going to get more expensive over time
[1:50:14] <cherrycottontail> need gold to count
[1:50:55] <+Fetrigon> EW woolieKICKDAD
[1:50:55] <+polothegreatest> uff

[1:51:59] <+SuperMightyGPlays> okay yeah what is even the point
[1:52:21] <Daxalog> Wait. People actually do Fates?
[1:52:22] <+Nomenanza> enshroud is the epitome of that "dont you wanna go apeshit" meme
[1:52:23] <studleydoorite> I thought that said you obtained 14 bitcoins for a second
[1:52:35] <Raz_Pataz> I tried touching monk for the first time since EW came out, shit's weird
[1:52:43] <%afronooch> lol
[1:52:50] <%RealThiele> goal complete
[1:52:54] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt have you started studium deliveries at all? the stories are pretty good
[1:52:54] <JossyJoestar> when you unlock flying, theres no point to maps. But you get the maps before you get flying
[1:52:54] <%baka_sugoi> psaBig POOP
[1:52:57] <dredgyboi> shit your pants , itll be funny to us
[1:53:02] <%BigCoffee> try to PUG a ex trial
[1:53:07] <+Fetrigon> do pvp. it's the real endgame... LUL
[1:53:08] <JossyJoestar> which is easy becauase you just do 6 fates when you first get into a zone
[1:53:41] <%BigCoffee> I hate Meteon and everything surrounding her, so the final 15 hours weren't fun for me, story wise.
[1:53:45] <SweetCuppingCake> I feel like Shadowbringers was a tighter story.
[1:53:54] <KyberNasse> Fighting Zenos as Reaper was tight
[1:54:05] <draca23> The purpose isn't 'knowing what's coming' but rather how "Your character reacts" to events.
[1:54:06] <+Fetrigon> @bigcoffee why?
[1:54:17] <%hoodedlefty> I personally liked the ending of 5.3 more with the "one last tour around the first"
[1:54:23] <%hoodedlefty> more
[1:54:47] <+Nomenanza> he makes sense for island sanctuary ye
[1:54:49] <@JustinianKnight> oh I didnt even think of that
[1:55:02] <@JustinianKnight> he prolly will have to do with the farm huh

[1:55:21] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Everyone thirsting over bunny bois while over here only Roes and Hroth do it for me
[1:55:24] <%BigCoffee> @fetrigon I couldn't take it that a singular character introduced 15 hours before the end was responsible for -everything- in the game. And also caused universal annihilation. And that no planet, anywhere, ever, could resist.

[1:58:34] <%Fidranth> I can't stand doing main scenario anymore
[1:58:48] <Raz_Pataz> aka do you your 83 dungeon when you're 83, and do roulette's on even levels
[1:58:51] <%JohnAtDawn> SAME
[1:59:01] <%W1nterTitan> I just watch Pat's stream
[1:59:09] <%Rumbutt> I just watch your stream or the podcats while I do it
[1:59:09] <%Vanslainstreams> i'm always staring at my second monitor while doing msq roulette watching shit on youtube
[1:59:10] <%Solareon_> im watching someone watch Masterchef during MSQ roulette
[1:59:10] <+Nomenanza> Gaius van Baelzar's dinner theater
[1:59:17] <%Rumbutt> PODCATS
[1:59:18] <%Amadeusguy> it'd be really nice if the main scenario roulette didn't seem to give Praetorium 9 times out of 10
[1:59:20] <%Agami23> i grind in gachas during MSQ
[1:59:25] <%W1nterTitan> spam AOEs until done
[1:59:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pat when im not playing XIV i wanna play XIV, and when i start playing XIV i feel bored even though i have so much shit to level how fix
[1:59:30] <+Kyma1020> I feel like the mobs in Prae and Catrum melt faster now
[1:59:39] <+wizard_of_diamonds> You were fooled
[1:59:41] <+wizard_of_diamonds> You foolish fool
[1:59:42] <%Rumbutt> they do
[1:59:44] <%RoggleJr> RoggleJr subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[1:59:45] <InboundFromSpace> they might be going to check the rare fate spot
[1:59:46] <%JoshManVGH> Do you think they will ever fix Cid walking through that damn door?
[1:59:49] <%Visorak6> leveling your first crafter is rough
[1:59:59] <KyberNasse> Any tips on getting into extreme/savage raiding?
[2:00:00] <Treasure_Vault> off to girllmao
[2:00:01] <%favadem> Do you prefer prae or castrum?
[2:00:11] <Treasure_Vault> What is it raining?
[2:00:13] <InboundFromSpace> very cold
[2:00:17] <Raz_Pataz> and more downtime
[2:00:20] <%Aeoneth> Freezing Rain PAt,  you live in Canada you know this
[2:00:26] <%legendfather_of_giants> also longer cutscenes, so less interruptions
[2:00:33] <%Double_Tap_That> @JoshManVGH All you gotta do to prevent that is kill the first group in that section.
[2:00:34] <%JohnAtDawn> Are you one of those gremilins who leave if its NOT Prae?
[2:00:37] <+Melthius36> depends on the atmospheric pressure
[2:00:39] <+Fetrigon> You're 5 minutes into rampage and chill with the squad and then a bunch catboys fall from the sky and attack you. LUL
[2:00:43] <+Nomenanza> boy PS5 doesn't like this area
[2:00:50] <%Vanslainstreams> magitec polution
[2:00:54] <%W1nterTitan> @PatStaresAt How'd you meet your XIV friends anyway?
[2:00:56] <%hoodedlefty> also you get better bathroom breaks in Preatorium
[2:00:58] <+degenbtv> there is a solution to Cid going through the door, if you kill the first 3 enemies in the room after he busts down the door he wont go through
[2:01:00] <+Nomenanza> ye it will have framedrops
[2:01:04] <%afronooch> ???? I was fine there on ps5
[2:01:14] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Castrum also has a lot of running around and clicking on things relative to Prae
[2:01:16] <%Agami23> i kept thinking this areas theme was gonna turn into the mako reactor theme
[2:01:17] <InboundFromSpace> the ps5 version really needs some optimization updates regardless
[2:01:32] <KyberNasse> PS5 version's framerate kind of shits when looking at the Tower
[2:01:32] <%NopeBadguy> is anyone able to log into mogstation on browser or log into ff right now? i can't get in, says a technical issue has occurred
[2:01:33] <+Nomenanza> @afronooch really? mine chugs a bit in the ruined city section
[2:01:39] <Psyramics> lmao just got booted out of the game, guess i'm done
[2:01:44] <Psyramics> hope Chi doesnt spawn
[2:01:44] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:01:45] <%Double_Tap_That> Generally I prefer Prae, but Castrum is good to get when I'm short on time
[2:01:50] <Raz_Pataz> D:
[2:02:03] <%favadem> the ps5 version chugs sometimes
[2:02:05] <+kylejefferies> I've got a friend on PS5 who complains a lot about falling under 30 frames.
[2:02:06] <Daniel_Is_I> To be fair, anything any melee can do, reaper can probably do better right now
[2:02:06] <+ImStilted> @NopeBadguy Same issue here.
[2:02:07] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I hate hearing how RPR is better DRG, because I love DRG :(
[2:02:10] <%Double_Tap_That> @Psyramics If it does good luck getting into the instance before it's kille
[2:02:12] <+Gregmeyer> but can it jump?????
[2:02:17] <%CzeekyTV> reaper and dragoon play so differently to begin with
[2:02:18] <%NeonLight> Estinien: Real shit?!
[2:02:25] <%afronooch> @Nomenanza yeah. ran just as smooth as everywhere else tbh
[2:02:26] <$Galeont> I used a fantasia earlier today and I haven't gotten an option to customize after logging out and in twice. am I doing something wrong?
[2:02:28] <Raz_Pataz> yeah but can they floor tank?
[2:02:29] <dredgyboi> oh no, im a dragoon, and a dumb dumb
[2:02:30] <%Aeoneth> I slapped the ShB Traveler's set on and cut myseld on the edge
[2:02:35] <%skeletonmilk> reaper's rotation feels way more natural
[2:02:39] <Psyramics> cant even log in, auth sever is just not working
[2:02:40] <+Melthius36> more emo
[2:02:44] <%afronooch> @Galeont are u naked when you log out
[2:02:45] <%furiousfurioso> but can it tank the floor better?
[2:02:47] <Ludarac> damn, i just got direct x error, now can't even log back in, just keep getting error at login
[2:02:48] <%favadem> reaper vs samurai which feels better to play?
[2:02:52] <%strugglepunk2> Yo did anyone else just get booted out of queue and can't log in now?
[2:02:53] <+Fetrigon> Are there still queues?
[2:02:58] <%strugglepunk2> Error 5003?
[2:02:59] <%zepherl> reaper is the best melee dps in the game right now
[2:03:04] <+Nomenanza> @favadem both are fun and good
[2:03:08] <%Kogashiwakai> weird, i main drg and i didnt understand any of reapers shit when I iniitially picked it up
[2:03:16] <$Galeont> @Galeont Yeah. I unequipped as much equipment as possible and removed all my gearsets. only thing I have equipped is a sword
[2:03:18] <%shurtal> i can't even log in to my square enix account
[2:03:19] <Arqartur0> Ok, that look amazing
[2:03:22] <%Kogashiwakai> yeah I also got that error.
[2:03:22] <thetruenicster> @strugglepunk2 I was in the middle of an EW dungeon and got booted, Error 90002
[2:03:24] <%walternatorz> blame elmo
[2:03:25] <lol_red_ranger> yeah but scythes are dumb
[2:03:25] <Treasure_Vault> healers adjust
[2:03:27] <%zepherl> in terms of raw damage dealer might even be better than black mage according to FFLogs?
[2:03:28] <%rekinom> Set your chocobo to heal, Pat
[2:03:31] <ThighsSupreme> Yep login errors have been happening since yesterday
[2:03:32] <%strugglepunk2> @shurtal Same
[2:03:40] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt it's not queue based, can't even login past launcher or even into mogstation
[2:03:41] <%LouieRouie> Dammit, Elmo
[2:03:45] <%psidefx> Healer:" He dont pay my sub"
[2:03:45] <Psyramics> are you guys on crystal?
[2:03:47] <%Amadeusguy> I also got the same error
[2:03:48] <Ubu2933> anyone else unable to login to their square account? got kicked from queue after like an hour and a half
[2:03:49] <+SuperMightyGPlays> launcher is spitting out an error. RIP
[2:03:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they do
[2:03:55] <%Saunt> They do
[2:03:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> don't they?
[2:03:57] <%Kogashiwakai> im crystal
[2:03:58] <KyberNasse> Reaper's the best once you get all the tools to get as many DT's as possible
[2:03:58] <Treasure_Vault> The only thing I know about black mage is it's the healer's fault.
[2:03:59] <%teebos> yeah, just got an error as well 100 ppl left. cant log back on. looks like its fucked
[2:03:59] <%rekinom> They do but they focus on nothing so they heal less
[2:04:03] <%shurtal> apparently there was a problem last night, that's still being worked on @strugglepunk2
[2:04:05] <%Mendin> No that's right
[2:04:05] <thetruenicster> It won't even let me log in either, it gives me a maintenance thing in JP
[2:04:05] <%Visorak6> sounds like the login auth exploded
[2:04:06] <+FZeroDMX> That is the case
[2:04:06] <%demiiluna> demiiluna subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 25 month streak! Hey, can't stay long because I had to put off playing Endwalker during finals week, but I love watching your vods in Queue!
[2:04:09] <%Saunt> they jsut do it poorly
[2:04:10] <+wizard_of_diamonds> They CAN do every move, and they will, meaning if you want heals focus when you really need it you won't get healed
[2:04:11] <thetruenicster> I'm in Crystal, too
[2:04:12] <+FZeroDMX> I just keep mine on free
[2:04:15] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> depends on the situation
[2:04:21] <+Melthius36> set to attack
[2:04:30] <InboundFromSpace> wait howd you get a chocobo past level. 10?
[2:04:31] <+Melthius36> kill more lol
[2:04:35] <$Galeont> @afronooch Yeah. I unequipped as much equipment as possible and removed all my gearsets. only thing I have equipped is a sword
[2:04:44] <%Saunt> They will regen right away after you lose 10% but only big heal <50% stuff like that
[2:04:46] <Ubu2933> thavnarian onions for each level past 10
[2:04:51] <%Valdorick> @InboundFromSpace Feed it Thavnir Onions.
[2:04:54] <+Fetrigon> LUL
[2:04:57] <InboundFromSpace> ahhh

[2:05:27] <%afronooch> @Galeont hmm. then idk.

[2:06:16] <%Birdigalore> half my FC just got dc'd.  I think I'm safe in Prae lol
[2:06:18] <%rekinom> It will deal less damage now, but it will heal a LOT more
[2:06:18] <+FZeroDMX> I didn‚Äôt even know you could go over 10 until a lil bit ago
[2:06:23] <%shadowkingpass> I got kicked just as i got in
[2:06:25] <KyberNasse> Pat, Radz-at-Han Day theme vs Night theme

[2:06:49] <%NopeBadguy> NotLikeThi
[2:06:50] <%CryoByjorne> the launcher is giving me an error

[2:07:24] <%JoshManVGH> why level 2 if not for maps?
[2:07:27] <%kainhighwind1990> What's your favorite dungeon out of all the new ones?
[2:07:36] <+Melthius36> uh oh lost server connection
[2:07:42] <+wizard_of_diamonds> WOW. I'm getting the weirdest error trying to log in. I try to start from the launch, and the actual launcher displays an error message
[2:07:48] <%rekinom> it looks cooler when you get the ogcd
[2:07:52] <Srthunda> I expected a spin tbh
[2:07:53] <%Shikari21> i cant even get past the launcher i get an error
[2:07:57] <Thenuclearwalrus> @wizard_of_diamonds everyone is

[2:08:23] <Thenuclearwalrus> @PatStaresAt Not just server dropping, the launcher is FUCKED too, getting Auth errors
[2:08:27] <%SatChamp> might just be servers on crysal?
[2:08:28] <+Blazen20> Pretty sure its just the login servers
[2:08:29] <MessyBristles> Can‚Äôt even attempt to log in
[2:08:32] <%natacalico> im hoping Excal is fine too, still in queue

[2:09:35] <Raz_Pataz> ye

[2:10:14] <%shurtal> i'm at 29 fates to go on the moon
[2:10:14] <%rekinom> the ogcd aoe is a like spiky swipe from the opposite directio
[2:10:17] <2Sam4Hall> servers are dying
[2:10:21] <%JoshManVGH> Then 90 is a flashy as fuck fuckyou finisher
[2:10:23] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Do you think the rabbits might finally top the namazu beast tribes as best tribe?
[2:10:26] <+Nomenanza> hell ye alien cactuars
[2:10:32] <%Chichen> they do be vibin on the moon tho
[2:10:38] <InboundFromSpace> it's level 83
[2:10:38] <ape_hawk> slendertaurs
[2:10:42] <%SatChamp> i got afk kicked by accident during titania trial, relogged and got kicked before the cutscene finished
[2:10:45] <+Melthius36> should have saved my game
[2:10:46] <+FZeroDMX> Loporrits are def gonna be top tier tribe
[2:10:49] <%JoshManVGH> The moon is so chill.
[2:11:05] <InboundFromSpace> loporrits better get a cool mount
[2:11:12] <+SuperMightyGPlays> yes
[2:11:12] <ape_hawk> yes
[2:11:19] <+Nomenanza> god I want a loporrit race so much
[2:11:22] <ape_hawk> they are a cosmic regularity
[2:11:25] <Azure_Storm> I hope they continue a trend of making new and weird cactuar
[2:11:25] <InboundFromSpace> wait till you visit the shard that's all cactuar
[2:11:27] <studleydoorite> cactuar said "we have to go to the moon" and then they went there
[2:11:30] <%Dakuu75> there's probably microscopic cactaur on your body, right now.
[2:11:41] <Raz_Pataz> so do we think the buns are gonna be the battle beast tribes?
[2:11:44] <%Visorak6> cacti can live in inhospitable places its not surprising
[2:11:44] <KyberNasse> loporrits better get the hum emote
[2:11:46] <%shurtal> calling it now, Lopporit mount is a giant carrot
[2:11:49] <%JoshManVGH> So Elephant people must be the crafting race, are the lopprots going to be gatherer? what's the new fairy beast tribe going to be?
[2:11:52] <+SuperMightyGPlays> when the universe falls to despair only cactaurs will be left
[2:11:53] <@CreepyPorpoise> saboslenders
[2:11:58] <Daxalog> Theyre are cactaurs in the air you breathe
[2:11:59] <%Focant> Fates got dc'd too
[2:11:59] <%walternatorz> imagine how microscopic it's needles would be
[2:12:08] <+Nomenanza> @CreepyPorpoise that's a good one
[2:12:11] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Saboslender is pretty strong
[2:12:14] <+FZeroDMX> Both the loporrits and akrasoda seem like crafter or gatherer, so I don‚Äôt know
[2:12:20] <%abrupt_abe> Welp, kicked out of Ultros queue after 3000 spots and an hour waiting
[2:12:23] <%Chichen> I wish i was STILL IN THE QUEUE
[2:12:24] <@JustinianKnight> @CreepyPorpoise justin92NoxusFace
[2:12:28] <+Toshatron> Hydaelyn's love for all things but ESPECIALLY cactuars
[2:12:30] <%Chichen> BUT now its launcher error simulator
[2:12:33] <+SeventhVice> @PatStaresAt people are slowly being kicked from the game
[2:12:38] <%kainhighwind1990> @abrupt_abe I was kicked out of Hyperion after two and a half hours
[2:12:40] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Fuck i just got kicked by 90k

[2:15:48] <%Rumbutt> Well I just got kicked fom Ultros
[2:15:48] <Daxalog> Do you think theyll ever patch it so that when enemies use abilities the hitbox will linger? So your not running into active  laser beams and fire?
[2:15:53] <%Chichen> nothin
[2:15:56] <%Saunt> Does the US Login servers use AWS? ^^
[2:15:59] <thetruenicster> There was an official thing on Lodestone that was at like, 2:45, but it seems to be appropriate for now
[2:16:01] <%JoshManVGH> AWS outage again?
[2:16:02] <%Chichen> nothin on lodestone so far
[2:16:05] <SweetCuppingCake> I'm starting to watch people get kicked

[2:16:24] <%Double_Tap_That> SE Account authentication seems to be down
[2:16:25] <%Visorak6> @Daxalog with how server ticks work being farther apart than most attack durations that'd be wack and jank
[2:16:27] <The_Mcmuffin> came to see if streamers having issues lol
[2:16:32] <%JoshManVGH> New buttons!
[2:16:40] <+DormaKazzy> how's reaper?
[2:16:46] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat, I just got a cat a few days ago for the first time after having had only dogs my entire life - any advice?
[2:16:47] <%JoshManVGH> Love new button levels
[2:16:49] <Raz_Pataz> get used to forgetting to prime it every time
[2:16:51] <%rekinom> Plentiful harvest is fucking siiiiick
[2:16:55] <%rekinom> it gives 50 shroud
[2:16:56] <+Fetrigon> button üîò KomodoHype
[2:16:58] <Ubu2933> can't login anywhere that needs a square enix account
[2:17:09] <b0nd0fs0uls> Okay hearing that others aren't able to log in just took a load of stress of me I was worried something happened to my account
[2:17:13] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat is grinding using trust good?
[2:17:18] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> from the Lodestone: Maintenance The server is experiencing unusually heavy traffic. Please try again later.
[2:17:19] <%JoshManVGH> Has a hella cast time for use in the same fight
[2:17:21] <+Melthius36> to be honest im surprised the internet works at all
[2:17:24] <%NopeBadguy> isn't harvest moon purely a opener/reopener move
[2:17:25] <KyberNasse> Plentiful Harvest is the best, free DT
[2:17:26] <%DianaTheAscian> exp*
[2:17:27] <Srthunda> of all the reaper abilities, harvest moon and harpe are my favorites
[2:17:27] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> DDoS?
[2:17:27] <%NopeBadguy> since soulsow is a cas
[2:17:48] <sun312772> How did you enjoy the Garlemald ark
[2:17:48] <Ubu2933> @b0nd0fs0uls me too it's why i came here just to see if otheres were having the same issue
[2:17:50] <ape_hawk> pat, if you wanna kill those things quick, just have sex with them
[2:17:54] <@JustinianKnight> its opener and downtime
[2:18:00] <@JustinianKnight> like boss leaves kinda thing
[2:18:07] <+Nomenanza> @NopeBadguy it is there if you are disengaged from the boss and can't be in a melee also
[2:18:17] <Raz_Pataz> like a fun anatman
[2:18:22] <%JoshManVGH> @davidcrimsonheidern Who could be DDoS ing the game more than the playerbase?
[2:18:28] <+Melthius36> cool dogo though
[2:18:29] <Saltmeisterr> ye machinisy
[2:18:31] <+Nomenanza> cool thing to use as the tank is pulling trash mobs
[2:18:39] <ItsPastas> Is there a resource where I can check controller crossbar setups? Endwalker fucked up all my layouts
[2:18:44] <KyberNasse> Gotta learn to cast the Soulsow between trash pulls lol, sometimes I forget NotLikeThis
[2:18:55] <+Melthius36> it feels like a shotgun
[2:18:59] <%JoshManVGH> Too badass I guess
[2:19:01] <b0nd0fs0uls> @ubu2933 Yeah same anxiety do the big spke
[2:19:05] <@JustinianKnight> Blunderbuss
[2:19:08] <ape_hawk> because fuck yoiu, thats why
[2:19:19] <%Puhff> cuz they talk old timey in FF14
[2:19:24] <@JustinianKnight> cuz it was alot of aether
[2:19:27] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt are any of your hunt marks on the moon while you wait?
[2:19:27] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[2:19:28] <%Chichen> i mean he's been there a while
[2:19:30] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt the fisher studium quest actually goes into how zodiark's absence has affected the ecosystem aethericall
[2:19:31] <Ubu2933> now that I know what up time to bounce before a rando spoiler flies my way
[2:19:31] <MKII> wonder if that'll be the optional trial story
[2:19:31] <Raz_Pataz> don't worry about it :)
[2:19:32] <%Chichen> gotta let that stink out
[2:19:32] <DarkSideCow> those are all the souls
[2:19:32] <%Aeoneth> Deep Dungeon justification?
[2:19:34] <+Nomenanza> I think that might just be zodiark glue
[2:19:35] <thehelminator> Can't log in gang Kreygasm
[2:19:35] <+PirateKefka> I can't log in right now after unplugging everything for a storm that ended up being more bark than bite so time to live vicariously through Pat
[2:19:37] <Bananassassin> I mean he was the supreme being of schmovement juice I figure it'd linger
[2:19:40] <%walternatorz> imagine how much aether juice he sucked up from half the ascians
[2:19:41] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Think of how many rejoined worlds he got aether from
[2:19:42] <+Ghazarban> Be glad its not something like blunderbuss
[2:19:42] <%Vanslainstreams> i mean he's been sealed there for how many thousands of years? gotta have stored up a lot of evil farts
[2:19:44] <DarkSideCow> half a planets [pop
[2:19:47] <%Ynkubus_> He was stewing in there for a while
[2:20:03] <$humbelpie> how are you breathing on the Moon?
[2:20:04] <+Melthius36> if we jump inside the moon do we become tataru?
[2:20:06] <%afronooch> MAI QUAD
[2:20:06] <ape_hawk> its like when you have a massive post-taco bell shit and the smell lingers for a few hours
[2:20:08] <+Fetrigon> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[2:20:09] <%kainhighwind1990> Chat, I've never done any hunts and iirc I was locked out of the EW board - how do I get them started?
[2:20:11] <cloakofashes> Cool, but what did the boss drop?
[2:20:16] <@JustinianKnight> clip that no context
[2:20:17] <ape_hawk> four nuts? youre a kro

[2:20:31] <metalsiren31> Magic
[2:20:33] <dagreenpillow> mmm space
[2:20:33] <%ratearth> gee pat, why does mom let you have FOUR nuts?
[2:20:34] <Srthunda> the in game answer is bunuy
[2:20:37] <%Rumbutt> the answer is that the moon was made that way
[2:20:37] <+Catpurnicus> its a Lunarian thing
[2:20:38] <KenzBurp> pat's playing for all of us now
[2:20:38] <$humbelpie> ah the Jimmy Neutron method, i see
[2:20:40] <%walternatorz> good ol' promvyion mobs
[2:20:40] <%Saunt> the rabbits nade it that way thats the answer
[2:20:41] <+Nomenanza> they explained that for Ultima Thule but not moon funnily enough
[2:20:42] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt the fisher studium quest actually goes into how zodiark's absence has affected the ecosystem aetherically
[2:20:43] <@SpaceCapnCrone> blessing of the Khojin
[2:20:44] <DarkSideCow> it was made with breathable atmo so everyone can run away
[2:20:45] <+polothegreatest> fortnuts?
[2:20:48] <+Catpurnicus> Cecil didn't have any issues back in IV so its fine
[2:20:48] <@SpaceCapnCrone> lets you breathe SPACE AIR
[2:20:49] <+Melthius36> we can swim underwater without breathing
[2:20:51] <+FistKitso> Aether or something
[2:20:51] <KnivesEve> those thinker mobs reminds me of the chains of promithia mobs from ff11
[2:20:52] <Saltmeisterr> YEYE ROBIT
[2:20:52] <MKII> you want some fries with that
[2:20:55] <+polothegreatest> magic LUL

[2:21:00] <+Nomenanza> @SpaceCapnCrone but scions tho
[2:21:01] <%NoMoreHero51> @PatStaresAt people getting kicked from game and are unable to log back in ,getting a super weird error
[2:21:02] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat a Scattergun appears to be a short barrel shotgun that fires exclusively scattershot, for wide coverage not range, so I guess it makes sense
[2:21:03] <+Mrbaconator> would you like fries with that baby
[2:21:05] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> so uhh is 14 log in stuff being DDoS rn lol
[2:21:08] <%baka_sugoi> is moon air cleaner the URFF air?
[2:21:09] <ape_hawk> HE
[2:21:09] <Gloppie> @kainhighwind1990 I think you have to unlock Shadowbringer hunts first
[2:21:10] <%Alazull> That's a lot of nuts to ligma
[2:21:16] <%Chichen> truly these are the final days
[2:21:17] <@SpaceCapnCrone> @Nomenanza The scions are just a figment of our imaginations
[2:21:20] <$humbelpie> THAT'LL BE 5 BUCKS BABY! YOU WANT FRIES WITH THAT
[2:21:27] <%NoMoreHero51> NoMoreHero51 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 59 months, currently on a 59 month streak! 
[2:21:33] <%kainhighwind1990> @Gloppie well, that sounds like a pain
[2:21:35] <ape_hawk> HE JUST LEFT, WITH SOME NUTS
[2:21:35] <%Visorak6> re: zodiark energy, my theory is that the essence of zodiark left in the other shards is probably bleeding through into the source
[2:21:40] <TheeRabbi> How much is the monthly sub fee for this HMO?
[2:21:44] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Which class has the best animations iyo?
[2:21:44] <+Melthius36> we breathe tennis ball can air
[2:21:47] <Raz_Pataz> heat blast looks kinda goofy
[2:21:55] <Gloppie> @Gloppie Nah, takes like 2 seconds
[2:22:02] <%JoshManVGH> I wish you could do cooler stuff with the ammo box. I'm tired of the same one for 50 levels
[2:22:05] <+Toshatron> get outta here, stinky

[2:23:18] <+bugz_munny> hey guess what dont dc right now
[2:23:19] <bigdaddypeanutbutter> Got home and tried to play I can even get into the game lol
[2:23:21] <%Valdorick> To be fire.
[2:23:22] <+Melthius36> Smores
[2:23:22] <%rekinom> It ticks faster than other dots @PatStaresAt
[2:23:23] <%zepherl> just don't log out and you'll be fine
[2:23:23] <+BIumen> To kill Moggle Mog
[2:23:23] <%JohnAtDawn> Its a dot
[2:23:24] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt flamethrower ticks every 1 second
[2:23:25] <metalsiren31> To rest my fingers
[2:23:26] <%Rumbutt> the point of flamethrower is to give your wrists a break
[2:23:27] <s__o__u__l_> Lalafel disposal
[2:23:27] <tidalwafer> it looks funny
[2:23:27] <+PirateKefka> I don't have the channel point to highlight but I'm hearing sound issues.  Was this something just started on the EW patch for Pat?  Cuz I've been getting a whole bunch of sound crunchies since the EW patch too and want to see if that's happening to other peeps
[2:23:29] <+Leftovermemes> its a fancy emote
[2:23:29] <+mgod19> just got disconnected too, came to see if pat was still playing
[2:23:30] <%JoshManVGH> Boring AOE I guess
[2:23:31] <%rekinom> It ticks every second instead of every 3 seconds @PatStaresAt
[2:23:33] <%Amadeusguy> It does damage every second instead of 3 seconds
[2:23:37] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Still can't get in. Yaaaaaaay
[2:23:37] <xDartuzax> Don't give in to despair, Pat!
[2:23:37] <Psyramics> it ticks every second, so its not
[2:23:38] <+Fetrigon> it looks cool
[2:23:39] <+Xicarda> it hits 11 times during the full duration
[2:23:41] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> its an consistent aoe so you can afk for a seconf
[2:23:43] <ape_hawk> flamethrowers look cool?
[2:23:44] <%Ynkubus_> Sippy break
[2:23:45] <+polothegreatest> more anxious than deleting backlog of games LUL
[2:23:53] <+Nomenanza> iirc you do it after reassembled bioblaster but could be wrong
[2:23:54] <%JoshManVGH> I hate that the noise doesn't stick around for the entirety of the animation
[2:23:54] <tidalwafer> no
[2:23:55] <DartAran> It's good it just has terrible feedback
[2:23:56] <NojadLalb> sat queue for 2 hours, game dies rip me
[2:23:58] <Raz_Pataz> worth using at least
[2:23:58] <%JohnAtDawn> In dungeons, yeah
[2:23:59] <thehelminator> It's to rest your fingers dude
[2:24:00] <%Amadeusguy> It's best used when all of your other AOEs are on cooldown
[2:24:01] <%Fidranth> flamethrower is good
[2:24:03] <%NopeBadguy> it's filler in your aoe rotation unless they changed it in ew @PatStaresAt
[2:24:04] <+Melthius36> bc Edgar
[2:24:06] <%ratearth> ope servers just shit out
[2:24:13] <+Xicarda> its great at more than 3 targets
[2:24:14] <+Nomenanza> worth
[2:24:18] <Raz_Pataz> when all other thing are on cd then yes
[2:24:19] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt it's worth hitting when everything else is down
[2:24:19] <KyberNasse> It's a break button
[2:24:21] <%kainhighwind1990> as long as you use it for the entire cast time
[2:24:21] <%NopeBadguy> in ao
[2:24:27] <edman9677> Sounds like a bunch of servers crashed. I can‚Äôt even get to the login queue and launch the game
[2:24:27] <%Durahand> best aoe after autocrossbow
[2:24:27] <%NopeBadguy> aoe
[2:24:28] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> for trash yes its worth it
[2:24:30] <+Melthius36> for fates i would say yes
[2:24:39] <+Nomenanza> 80 for 10s with a tick each 1 sec
[2:24:39] <%Valdorick> That's 800 then?
[2:24:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> its worth using only if you know you're NOT going to move
[2:24:44] <Calek> flamethrower is 800 over 10 seconds
[2:24:45] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Yeah I can't even log in in the launcher now
[2:24:45] <+bugz_munny> PowerUpL <3 PowerUpR authentication servers take my energy
[2:24:45] <%rekinom> flamethrower is effetctively 800 potency per target over 10s @PatStaresAt
[2:24:46] <%Rumbutt> 80 every second
[2:24:50] <wqorst> it looks dumb tho
[2:24:51] <%baronblank> flamethrower would be 200 per 2.5 seconds then right?
[2:24:58] <umberhulk_lord> Square Enix account error and now I'm fucking sad
[2:25:00] <%baronblank> so it's slightly better?
[2:25:04] <%Amadeusguy> scattergun giving more heat gauge might actually make it worthless but I don't know the nitty-gritty numbers for it
[2:25:09] <+Xicarda> it ticks every second for 11 hits total
[2:25:16] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt it's still filler in your aoe rotation while everything else is down
[2:25:27] <Dustplox> Tooltip bad
[2:25:40] <+Nomenanza> dont worry about it
[2:25:41] <%baronblank> it still seems bad just not completely worthless
[2:25:41] <%Rumbutt> only in FF14 does a flamethrower give no heat
[2:25:42] <+Xicarda> It still maths out to be better, its fucked honestly
[2:25:43] <Raz_Pataz> no heat? delete
[2:25:44] <Calek> scattergun doesn't replace flamethrower
[2:25:55] <%Fidranth> it's really funny that flamethrower gives no heat
[2:25:58] <%kainhighwind1990> flamethrower is a filler skill
[2:25:58] <KyberNasse> Cold flamethrower
[2:25:59] <+Melthius36> make smores
[2:26:01] <%Valdorick> If anything, Flamethrower should spend heat Kappa
[2:26:04] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt flamethrower is your filler before scattergun once all your other aoe is down
[2:26:09] <thehelminator> it's just an anti-carpal tunnel button :)
[2:26:16] <+bugz_munny> yeah dont dc right now
[2:26:21] <Ash_Harden> Login servers seem to be down?
[2:26:25] <+TaifuDragon> The servers are dying the final days are upon us
[2:26:28] <Calek> flamethrower is your "I want to take a drink now" button
[2:26:35] <MKII> I'm seeing people getting d/c'd stay safe
[2:26:35] <thetruenicster> Mantorok Eternal Darkness is here?
[2:26:39] <+bugz_munny> Servers let it set in
[2:26:45] <umberhulk_lord> Why even keep living is I can't fish
[2:26:49] <+bugz_munny> Full submission to nihility
[2:26:52] <%Mantorok06> psaLiz
[2:26:56] <KenzBurp> damn cryptobros
[2:26:59] <Raz_Pataz> it doesn't feel very good to use
[2:27:03] <Calek> works well in dungeons
[2:27:04] <+AngelFlashNishikino> the lodestone server status page says its down for system maintenance cirBlech
[2:27:11] <%ratearth> Welp guess it's time to practice Blazblue to kick Woolie's ass on stream
[2:27:14] <Calek> especially the big pulls
[2:27:24] <%NopeBadguy> if anything flamethrower is a dungeon pull button
[2:27:27] <%Valdorick> The only Flame Thrower I care about is High Fire 2
[2:27:31] <KnivesEve> pat the pull out king
[2:27:36] <%watts121> So people are dropping like flys and unable to get back into FFXIV
[2:27:43] <%Felhad> Servers are big exploding
[2:28:01] <s__o__u__l_> pepeLaugh
[2:28:05] <%Giantsuperguy> oh shit I need to reinstall centralfiction since it has rollback now
[2:28:05] <GuyNamedGatsby> Oh good I thought I was the only one unable to even log in rn
[2:28:05] <Calek> flamethower + bioblaster is a fun combo during wall to wall pulls in dungeons
[2:28:05] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt You see any of the footage for Dave Lang's wrestling battle royale game? Jeff Gerstmann played it for a bit and it looks great
[2:28:08] <%thelaxinator> @PatStaresAt Flamethrower has a weird utility in which people will use it where a boss is about to become vulnerable out of an invuln phase in order to deal damage the SECOND that they become hittable
[2:28:08] <%watts121> Authentication Error
[2:28:13] <%Birdigalore> you better find some wood to knock on
[2:28:22] <Raz_Pataz> it's all cats
[2:28:23] <studleydoorite> my brain is always closed
[2:28:24] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The launcher shows all the servers as being up, must be a log in server side problem

[2:30:06] <Darani9> @PatStaresAt They're not worth

[2:30:17] <%RocketBarrel> Halp. Game serverbis exploding
[2:30:18] <thehelminator> kinda liked when the music was all muffled at the beginning, sounded like that Caretaker album
[2:30:19] <Ultimatefool> Yep, I also just randomly got 90ked
[2:30:19] <%JoshManVGH> Oh shit, any of the depression races are viable for Beast tribe stuff, arent they?
[2:30:20] <Ahack13> Also on Ultos, servers seem fine atm

[2:31:47] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:32:04] <+Fetrigon> NotLikeThis
[2:32:06] <SemiGaseous> Why is Pat's music cutting in and out like a warped vinyl?

[2:32:14] <KyberNasse> I should try fishing up the phallaina here
[2:32:15] <%amused_platypus> its probably because pizza emote
[2:32:29] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> servers dying for anyone else??
[2:32:29] <%NopeBadguy> @SemiGaseous twitch does that, refresh the viewer
[2:32:39] <thehelminator> bruh, how am I supposed to farm fates if I'm crying!?
[2:32:41] <Gloppie> Twitch boosts stream to like 1.05 speed to catch up sometimes. Fucks with audio
[2:32:51] <+Fetrigon> good luck o7
[2:32:58] <SemiGaseous> Oh totally weird, thanks I didn't know that yall
[2:33:03] <+Melthius36> minion savage
[2:33:03] <%Valdorick> if Twitch Desyncs it tries to speed up the playback rather than skip you ahead, so you just need to pause and unpaase the video to fix music distortion
[2:33:04] <%Saunt> Lodestone is down now
[2:33:10] <%HaloIsA> @qu3kl41n_the_impure_king Was alsom wondering
[2:33:18] <%RealThiele> yea launcher is dead

[2:33:35] <+Mr_ZombieFetish> I'm glad im not the only one lol
[2:33:38] <%Rumbutt> @SemiGaseous It's better to click pause and then play than to refresh in my experience, the slowdown that warps it often comes from loading in
[2:33:38] <+BlubRobe> The maidens are really going through it rn
[2:33:42] <%DianaTheAscian> what do those do btw?

[2:36:21] <%maskedriderhero> @Melthius36 Its right there, what remains of the Dragonstar is here in Ultima Thule
[2:36:26] <+HelloImTom08> I DCed too :(
[2:36:27] <%Chichen> you cant make me
[2:36:28] <%Valdorick> I have to wonder, if the Omnicrom had heard about super wizards living on a super aether world, would the ancients of 1v1'd them to their deaths? "Oh man, look at these strange mechanical men from the stars... time to unmake them."

[2:56:02] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> the dungoonn
[2:56:02] <ohno778> i don't remember hahatali
[2:56:03] <%hoodedlefty> Ok so I might have sent the Crazy Talk log out to Lulu...
[2:56:04] <%Rumbutt> love how helpful people are to sprouts in 14
[2:56:04] <mak0t0yukii> People are nice enough to progress dungeon without kicking you, like i d/c'd at a last dungeon boss
[2:56:08] <%ArticPath> Does
[2:56:16] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> yup
[2:56:16] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Fenrirlives Id check out someone like BitWit about that, not Pat
[2:56:23] <+Nomenanza> their base values are stupid high
[2:56:23] <Bananassassin> @PatStaresAt I had a friend who was running this have their tank go to the right and literally everyone on the Discord realized they'd never done this boss from the other side EVER
[2:56:25] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Least favorite dungeon aside from all the early game ones?
[2:56:34] <+Crackensan> Reaper is REALLY overtuned; even at top end - they do a DISGUSTING amount of damage
[2:56:41] <$StrawberryPantsu> Wait IS Reaper Unga?
[2:56:41] <+SuperMightyGPlays> reaper seems kind of overly good
[2:56:46] <%NopeBadguy> dungon?
[2:56:48] <+FZeroDMX> I don‚Äôt think it gets many if any potency buffs to their 1-2-3
[2:56:49] <%Visorak6> STONE VIGIL
[2:56:51] <%SatChamp> 1st coil
[2:56:54] <+Nomenanza> their combos starter potency is like 200 base?
[2:56:54] <%RealThiele> low level scaling is that way for everyone
[2:56:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> i still havent done neverreap
[2:56:55] <%NopeBadguy> which one is never reap agai
[2:56:55] <Nurdock> Alwaysreap
[2:56:56] <%DianaTheAscian> YUP
[2:56:56] <@QueequegTheater> Stone Vigil
[2:56:57] <$StrawberryPantsu> Neverreap is...
[2:56:57] <gespenst25> ej
[2:57:01] <ohno778> 1.0 aurum vale
[2:57:02] <gespenst25> eh
[2:57:02] <Nurdock> Love me some tornados!
[2:57:02] <%Valdorick> Everwipe?
[2:57:02] <$StrawberryPantsu> Uh
[2:57:03] <hexen_emma> For me it's Vale, easily
[2:57:04] <+Crackensan> Same; Neverreap makes me unnecessarily angry
[2:57:09] <%ratearth> ALWAYSREAP
[2:57:09] <+FistKitso> SO much invuln phases
[2:57:10] <%DianaTheAscian> STONE VIGIL IS ALSO UP THERE
[2:57:13] <%zepherl> reaper will probably get some potency nerfs it's top DPS on FFLogs rn
[2:57:13] <%Koopardon> Fair
[2:57:24] <+Nomenanza> Thousands Maws is THE worst
[2:57:24] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Copperbell hard.
[2:57:29] <+Nomenanza> that dungeon is just awful
[2:57:36] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> I honestly dont have too much strong feelings about most of them
[2:57:37] <%Dakuu75> I just did "ridorana lighthouse" earlier... that shit SUCKED-HARD
[2:57:38] <Ash_Harden> I wish they would make the minimum dungeon level the lowest level/ ilvl for roulettes
[2:57:41] <aflowerybard> I foolishly wasted my free trial because I was always told the world is full so I never played ff14, but now I wanna try it bad, someone cry for me
[2:57:41] <gespenst25> Alwaysreap
[2:57:43] <%hoodedlefty> CopperHell
[2:57:45] <zacyzacyz> yea thats what i was gonna say
[2:57:45] <%zajoestar> servers back up?
[2:57:45] <%JGardner03> Oh man that clip of the auth error was great
[2:57:49] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Literally only did Copper Hard once LUL
[2:57:50] <$StrawberryPantsu> Best dungeon is Tower of Babil
[2:57:51] <+Crackensan> Atherchemical Research Facility also gives me some PTSD; simply because of the Tomestone farm back in Heavensward.  Uuuugggh
[2:57:51] <%W1nterTitan> they always do that
[2:57:53] <%favadem> favorite dungeon?
[2:57:54] <%NopeBadguy> HELP THE SPROUT
[2:57:59] <%Koopardon> Amdapor Keep is a goddamn slog
[2:58:00] <zacyzacyz> copperbell hard is so frustrating as a tank
[2:58:05] <%Valdorick> Sprout doesn't know, the Dungeon Treasure is awful.
[2:58:06] <+TuskDeluxe> I have a major distaste for Cutter's Cry it's just so boring
[2:58:12] <+TunakIn> i never did any of the hard versions of dungeons
[2:58:13] <+Nomenanza> Maybe it does when you defeat the boss
[2:58:18] <Kain5707> dungeons are basically POTD now
[2:58:20] <RetributionP> money Big money
[2:58:21] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Toto-Rak, actually
[2:58:22] <+Nomenanza> I honestly can't tell what the formula is now
[2:58:25] <@SpaceCapnCrone> I hate toto-rak the most
[2:58:26] <+SuperMightyGPlays> copperbell normal is "wait during boss fights" the dungeon
[2:58:36] <%Valdorick> Toto-Rak is pretty bad.
[2:58:44] <zacyzacyz> does it increase your total xp at the end?
[2:58:44] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat what's the worst trail not including hydra and Chimera
[2:58:46] <@JustinianKnight> just give it lifesteal
[2:58:48] <%rekinom> MNK is actually higher than RPR right now on fflogs
[2:58:48] <@JustinianKnight> on hits
[2:58:49] <%W1nterTitan> @SpaceCapnCrone yeah that one is pretty trash
[2:58:54] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt i think you're really underestimating oblation
[2:58:59] <%Dakuu75> I been re-doing dungeons for the glamours, like a crazy person
[2:59:00] <%shootbang_exe> also living dead needs some sort of tweak
[2:59:07] <@QueequegTheater> It needs cooler damage buttons. It has too many
[2:59:07] <%aishman> aishman subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 37 months! Time to ponder THE ORB.Also EW SPOILERS: do you think the next villain is gonna be some chicken shit heel OR someone who can fuck with us now that crystal mom's ward is gone?
[2:59:12] <%kainhighwind1990> @JustinianKnight I think it should be like FF4 DRK where it uses its own hp to boost its attack
[2:59:14] <+Nomenanza> @JustinianKnight well it has on soul stealer but ye it needs it on like blood weapon
[2:59:19] <+HelloImTom08> the TBN tax tho LUL
[2:59:21] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt DRK needs fewer but cooler damage
[2:59:22] <Kain5707> LD LU
[2:59:22] <%zajoestar> WAR and PLD are literally unkillable in dungeons
[2:59:24] <Kain5707> LUL
[2:59:25] <%aishman> how is the orb a link....
[2:59:26] <@QueequegTheater> *damage buttons
[2:59:31] <%JohnAtDawn> Oblation is so you dont HAVE to press living dead, but whatever...
[2:59:33] <%Visorak6> living dead is just poorly designed imo
[2:59:34] <RetributionP> living dead so trash
[2:59:40] <%DeRedBaron> it needs a button that when you press it, you get health
[2:59:42] <%JoshManVGH> 10% isn't norhing, but it's not as good has a like Camouflage
[2:59:44] <+TuskDeluxe> Solution: they give DRK a literal nuke
[2:59:45] <zacyzacyz> yeah DRK needs a self heal the most and didnt get one LUL
[2:59:46] <+HelloImTom08> PLD feels awesome but im excited to lvl war too
[2:59:46] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt oblation is great party utility and is a new defensive button unlike all other tanks who got upgrades to existing defensive cds instead
[2:59:53] <%NopeBadguy> so it's another thing to pres
[2:59:55] <%Double_Tap_That> Oblation's just not that good for so high-level an ability.
[2:59:57] <@QueequegTheater> Holmgang is literally just Better Living Dead
[3:00:00] <%JohnAtDawn> Yes, and that's bullshit
[3:00:03] <%DeRedBaron> the whole point is that you SHOULD be able to survive your own invuln not never press it
[3:00:24] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> I am gonna set the pat DCing as my phone ring tone, that was piceless
[3:00:26] <$StrawberryPantsu> Warrior is nigh on Unkillable
[3:00:29] <+ElMangoes> WAR presses Bloodwhetting, BECOME IMMORTAL
[3:00:32] <user_naim> saw that clip on twitter holy fuck
[3:00:34] <$StrawberryPantsu> *In dungeons
[3:00:34] <orogenesis> funnily enough drk has the highest personal dps right now out of all tanks
[3:00:38] <ohno778> DRK get big dick damage and i'm okay with that
[3:00:38] <metalsiren31> It's dumb how fragile DRK is in comparison now
[3:00:44] <%DeRedBaron> at least add a heal to carve and spit cus that sharing a CD with abyssal for the MANA is stupid
[3:00:55] <+Melthius36> in tha grave
[3:00:56] <%DianaTheAscian> DRK makes me so sad now
[3:00:59] <%JohnAtDawn> I'm not going to claim Dark Knight didn't get shafted, I'm just really tired of people talking like it's straight up unviable.
[3:01:00] <metalsiren31> TBN went from the best mitigation to the worst
[3:01:02] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt What DRK also needs is a complete overhaul of its damage oGCDs. There's too many of them right now and none of them feel good
[3:01:09] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat does Superbolid trigger Heart of Corodium!?
[3:01:11] <Kain5707> 2ED2EZ
[3:01:12] <zacyzacyz> then good luck LUL
[3:01:24] <%skeletonmilk> @JoshManVGH HELL YEAH IT DOES
[3:01:26] <Blank9> sage is so good
[3:01:27] <%Solareon_> WHAT
[3:01:27] <%skeletonmilk> AND IT'S AWESOME
[3:01:30] <%JoshManVGH> FUCK living dead sucks!
[3:01:31] <$StrawberryPantsu> What?!
[3:01:32] <%Solareon_> ARE YOU SERIOUS
[3:01:33] <ValkahRoctsteel> Did Sophia normal earlier and after both healers died half way through, the GNB and WAR didn‚Äôt even need healing
[3:01:38] <%SolidusRex> WOAH
[3:01:39] <@QueequegTheater> WHAT
[3:01:42] <%DeadStage> If you're under 50% hp HEART OF CORUNDUM PROCS INSTANTLY
[3:01:43] <%nikoloas_> I didn't know that
[3:01:44] <zacyzacyz> OH
[3:01:45] <%nikoloas_> nice
[3:01:46] <+quackisalive> Have a weird bug where I havbe no sound except system sounds
[3:01:47] <%luftraumm1> I hate making healers struggle with the drk inv
[3:01:56] <+TunakIn> WHAT
[3:01:56] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:01:57] <%Solareon_> i want whatever hard drugs the devs were doing when they made HoC and bloodwhetting. theyre so good
[3:01:57] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Do you think Living Dead could be fixed if you only needed to be healed to 25% to prevent death?
[3:01:58] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt the big thing is that oblation is another cd to press on top of existing cds while other tanks just got upgrades to existing cds, which gives drk one more defensive cd than other tanks to press at a ti
[3:02:00] <EscoSul> yeah, pop aurora with it for extra heals!
[3:02:01] <%Divryne> They'll probably make some DRK changes when Savage comes out.
[3:02:03] <gespenst25> what is it really like when superbolid
[3:02:07] <+TunakIn> I need to try that
[3:02:11] <%CzeekyTV> the biggest nail in the coffin is that both Holmgang and Superbolide got buffed to 10s duration, making LD even more obsolete
[3:02:14] <Kain5707> we cant see it
[3:02:14] <%DeRedBaron> like even if they gave you a button that healed you at the cost of all your blood guage but like scaled with your blood gauge that would be better than no heal
[3:02:18] <%JoshManVGH> Wow!
[3:02:19] <$StrawberryPantsu> THAT'S BULLSHIT
[3:02:19] <zacyzacyz> WHAT
[3:02:20] <+Nomenanza> damn look at this fashion show
[3:02:20] <BobbyHopp> gunbreakers 90 set is so clean
[3:02:21] <@JustinianKnight> lol
[3:02:28] <Kain5707> oh hes in the party
[3:02:31] <Kain5707> LUL
[3:02:32] <zacyzacyz> I SAW
[3:02:34] <%JoshManVGH> Wow that's fucking grand!
[3:02:34] <%DianaTheAscian> WOW WOW WOW
[3:02:35] <%nikoloas_> I saw it
[3:02:40] <zacyzacyz> THATS insane
[3:02:44] <RetributionP> pld best tank
[3:02:45] <%JoshManVGH> Salt for DRK totally validated
[3:02:50] <Kain5707> do it again
[3:02:57] <+Nomenanza> iirc there is a small window where immunity on GNB doesn't trigger and you can die due to being put to 1 HP
[3:02:58] <@JustinianKnight> enjoy this oblation
[3:03:00] <%JGardner03> It's got TBN
[3:03:00] <+Nomenanza> no idea if they fixed it
[3:03:02] <%luftraumm1> dark it up
[3:03:04] <%JGardner03> LUL
[3:03:08] <%DeRedBaron> as much salt as they salt the earth
[3:03:09] <%PayCreeps_> dont forget GNB has two charges of its regen now too
[3:03:12] <%Double_Tap_That> How would you fix it? It's clear they want all the invulns to be unique
[3:03:18] <%JohnAtDawn> Prolly not, you look like you have animations off
[3:03:18] <+Crackensan> Warriors now make healers optional in 4 mans, Paladins are literal brick houses, Gunbreakers have HoC - Dark Knight..... uhhhhh stuff?
[3:03:19] <orogenesis> DRK self sustain sucks, although it does the highest dps out of all 4 tanks.
[3:03:21] <%JoshManVGH> Need a dummy
[3:03:29] <metalsiren31> GNB also has super slick AF armor too
[3:03:31] <+Nomenanza> and GNB also has a free excog every 30 sec
[3:03:48] <%CzeekyTV> turn battle effects on
[3:03:49] <%DeRedBaron> i dont matter the mass DPS shouldn't be the trade off, cus they dont get to be tanks like the  other tanks in this expanstion
[3:03:56] <Kain5707> LUL
[3:03:57] <%JoshManVGH> LUL
[3:04:01] <%DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL
[3:04:04] <+HelloImTom08> GJ LUL
[3:04:05] <BobbyHopp> PLD feels good but needs a slight damage buff
[3:04:08] <orogenesis> also the fact that blood weapon is not stack based despite delirium being stack based is so puzzling
[3:04:16] <+Fetrigon> LUL
[3:04:16] <%JoshManVGH> Looks flashy
[3:04:16] <%Logoth_> That's a lot
[3:04:25] <ohno778> GETSUGA TENSHOU
[3:04:27] <gespenst25> but does warrior have a STAND?
[3:04:31] <+evil_inc> Bring back old abyssal
[3:04:41] <Kain5707> the salted earth proc animation is so dumb too
[3:04:42] <%Dakuu75> what is that big aoe thing, should I stand in that?
[3:04:42] <+Fetrigon> PunOko pat no
[3:04:43] <%JohnAtDawn> Yeah the Blood Weapon thing is just retarded
[3:04:44] <%CzeekyTV> Blood Weapon literally needed charges the most out of everything that got charges, but didn't get it. very lame
[3:04:45] <+mokla12> I'm kinda sad what happened to DRK :(
[3:04:45] <%Logoth_> How is paladin in the expansion
[3:04:46] <%RealThiele> living is way cooler
[3:04:47] <+HelloImTom08> your favorite job sucks LUL
[3:04:48] <%NopeBadguy> also drk can use oblation twice in a row, similar to pld, which gnb and war can't do with blood or hear
[3:04:51] <+Fetrigon> PunOko no
[3:04:51] <Seathts> I thought that changing oblation to an ED and Walking Dead giving a self healing buff so you could heal yourself out of LD would be a great change.
[3:04:53] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt I just finished getting all of the ShB dragon mounts the day before EW - which EX mount grind was the worst for you?
[3:04:54] <orogenesis> yeah 5 gcd blood weapon is still a myth if you have like 100ms+ ping
[3:04:59] <hexen_emma> Come on Shinryu
[3:05:03] <%JoshManVGH> Blood Weapon having charges would solid
[3:05:03] <thegreatbambe> How about the DRK aoe not be spells either lmao
[3:05:03] <%brisk_dacat> and give him a shark with lazers
[3:05:08] <%NopeBadguy> NOW WHAT I ACTUALLY WANT
[3:05:08] <%skeletonmilk> i kiss my kitty and she goes "prrrp?"
[3:05:11] <%NopeBadguy> IS STACK BASED BLOOD WEAPON
[3:05:14] <+TuskDeluxe> Come on Thordan
[3:05:15] <+SuperMightyGPlays> sounds like living dead just needs to be reworked

[3:06:19] <%DeRedBaron> LIke living dead probably shouldn't be a minigame on top of it, but legit im willing to keep it that way as long as you can heal yourself and not 100% i'd be happy

[3:09:26] <%InternetShis> Oh man I got off work for the actual best trial in the game
[3:09:26] <@JustinianKnight> NO
[3:09:27] <@JustinianKnight> LOL
[3:09:27] <%Valdorick> Yeah, the bar is a lie
[3:09:31] <%Felhad> lol, no it doesn't
[3:09:32] <@JustinianKnight> you almost failed it
[3:09:33] <BobbyHopp> it makes it look scary
[3:09:37] <FelixAyada> no it doesn't lmao
[3:09:37] <%JGardner03> Almost threw the match
[3:09:37] <+Nomenanza> nah you can max out that bar
[3:09:37] <Kain5707> no
[3:09:39] <%InternetShis> It doesn't
[3:09:41] <Kain5707> not at all
[3:09:41] <@JustinianKnight> you can keep it full
[3:09:43] <Raz_Pataz> bad masher
[3:09:43] <+Valison> no it doesn't
[3:09:44] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Which EX mount grind was the worst for you?
[3:09:49] <@CreepyPorpoise> not true pat
[3:09:50] <ninjatdog> it freaked me out the first time and hit the windows key and failed it lol
[3:09:50] <%shurtal> i was once in a roullette that failed that 3 straight times, it was painful
[3:09:51] <%DianaTheAscian> I can actually keep up that full bar
[3:09:51] <asagi_ryuu> RAW FIGHT
[3:09:53] <+RelikaNox> Time for where I screamed, I cried, etc
[3:09:53] <@CreepyPorpoise> I kept it full the whole time lol
[3:09:53] <%rekinom> I just use a left click spam macro lo
[3:09:54] <+A0N33> It's not hard if you're on a keyboard
[3:09:54] <draca23> No, Pat, you're just bad
[3:09:57] <Kain5707> mash all your buttons
[3:09:57] <%Felhad> you super can
[3:09:58] <@CreepyPorpoise> use your keyboard
[3:09:58] <%AlteisenReiseZ> god this fight always hypes me up
[3:10:02] <%Visorak6> no it doesnt it prevents you from reachin bottom
[3:10:04] <@JustinianKnight> use dpad and face buttons and shoulders
[3:10:04] <gespenst25> Hi Emet
[3:10:05] <metalsiren31> You can mash every button
[3:10:06] <+Nomenanza> you can mash both dpad and face buttons to get MAXIMUM mash input
[3:10:06] <Ash_Harden> Easier to mash on KBM
[3:10:07] <%JGardner03> Easy mode was selected?
[3:10:08] <+BIumen> five minutes after this emet ends up in ultima thule
[3:10:09] <citerel> you gotta mash all of the buttons
[3:10:11] <%Kaask> controller can spam buttons and mash impossibly fast. keyboard has to click
[3:10:11] <%Solareon_> more keys
[3:10:12] <+TuskDeluxe> multi buttons
[3:10:12] <Kain5707> NotLikeThis
[3:10:13] <%InternetShis> If I mash WASD and click, I can max it out but it won't succeed like normal
[3:10:14] <FelixAyada> any key pushes the button
[3:10:15] <%rekinom> It's faster because you can mash more buttons
[3:10:15] <%Birdigalore> hitting multiple keys
[3:10:15] <+A0N33> All buttons count
[3:10:16] <%shurtal> scroll wheel
[3:10:18] <%Retinolgaming> Yeah but why would you mash that much to keep it full, don't do that to your hands people.
[3:10:21] <%rekinom> each button that is mashed counts
[3:10:21] <Ralfclogs> I bet you don't even carpal tunnel pat
[3:10:21] <tanarath> Just faceroll
[3:10:22] <ItsPastas> He saved you because he remembered after going to the aetherial sea :)
[3:10:23] <Kain5707> PAT
[3:10:26] <%JoshManVGH> Emet you fop
[3:10:26] <%JGardner03> You've got all the buttons on KB
[3:10:27] <RetributionP> all the buttons on the keyboard count
[3:10:29] <asagi_ryuu> TO ME WARRIORS OF LIGHT
[3:10:29] <Raz_Pataz> for pride
[3:10:29] <+Valison> you can press more than one button
[3:10:30] <%InternetShis> I have crack hands
[3:10:30] <Karhax> multiple keys are faster
[3:10:30] <Ash_Harden> Mouse AND keyboard work for mash
[3:10:32] <%rekinom> each individual button that is mashed adds to the gauge
[3:10:32] <%Dregon_Azure> more buttons makes it go faster
[3:10:32] <%thedankestmeeme> yeah all the buttons do matter tho
[3:10:33] <iHeretic> it registers all the buttons for mashes
[3:10:36] <metalsiren31> I dunno, it works somehow
[3:10:37] <demetristerling> why hit many button when few button do good
[3:10:38] <%rekinom> it's multiplicativ
[3:10:40] <%that__tj> Sup everyone, anyone else hanging out on Phoenix waiting for Chi to spawn also?
[3:10:41] <+Nomenanza> it registers each button input separetly
[3:10:42] <Daniel_Is_I> One key = 1 button press so you slam your keyboard and hit like 20 keys per press
[3:10:43] <SuperTygerMan> All the face buttons and dpad count
[3:10:43] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat quantity over speed
[3:10:45] <%InternetShis> It's 5 buttons
[3:10:46] <+Nomenanza> so more buttons = more mash
[3:10:49] <%Solareon_> it registers EVERY button you hit so you can roll your hand on the keyboard
[3:10:49] <%maskedriderhero> How would Warrior of Light Elidibus match up against Endsinger
[3:10:56] <Comb711> How are we feeling about Smileton and Sigma Grindset?
[3:10:56] <Raz_Pataz> they all register but you never need to
[3:11:03] <%kainhighwind1990> WHY DOES HE SAY SALVATION SO WEIRD
[3:11:03] <%JohnAtDawn> LIMIT BREAK FOUR

[3:17:31] <%zajoestar> Tank brain
[3:17:44] <%JGardner03> Bitter End might be to short, better against one of the LB's
[3:17:51] <%NopeBadguy> PAT JESUS FUCK CLEAN YOUR INVENTORY
[3:17:53] <%Valdorick> I think he has to be animation locking himself with his own LB?
[3:17:55] <%that__tj> that__tj subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Already did your RareFate 48h Marathons?
[3:18:06] <%JGardner03> What, how is your inventory so empty
[3:18:09] <mor3gan> why are there items with bigger numbers you aren't wearing?
[3:18:19] <%Fenrirlives> @patstaresat is Darius the Protagonist? he has insane Main Character energy lmao
[3:18:26] <+R_BChe> are we gonna get a chi waiting room segment
[3:18:32] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Are you surprised that Bard got buffed so hard?
[3:18:42] <%legendfather_of_giants> just use your armory chest and hit optimize 4head
[3:18:51] <Kain5707> are you going to stream the extreme trials?
[3:18:58] <%that__tj> @R_BChe in phoenix waiting right now lol 85%
[3:19:02] <RetributionP> pats inventory is cluttered so his armory can be clean
[3:19:16] <%maskedriderhero> Do you consider it the best expansion story wise?  What about Final Fantasy game wise?
[3:19:23] <@QueequegTheater> Pat doesn't want to expose his balls too much
[3:19:26] <%zajoestar> Have you beaten chi yet?
[3:19:40] <@JustinianKnight> I am the drk now
[3:19:47] <%Kiso52> @PatStaresAt I cleared the first EX trial like 9 times and seen enrage on the second one i think as a tank main youre gonna love the second one

[3:20:23] <%Valdorick> Lolrito Mk2
[3:20:24] <Ahack13> Im calling buisnessman
[3:20:26] <$StrawberryPantsu> Lolorito
[3:20:27] <Comb711> I hope in 6.1 the stakes have never been lower
[3:20:28] <Raz_Pataz> what if it was lolorito
[3:20:29] <%Visorak6> Oh MAN
[3:20:33] <Kain5707> @Kiso52 tanking the 2nd trial is very good
[3:20:35] <%maskedriderhero> Lolorito but hes actually evil and not just capitalist evil
[3:20:36] <%zajoestar> just some dude
[3:20:38] <%Visorak6> Oh my god lolorito
[3:20:38] <%skeletonmilk> that one weirdo blushing roe from stormblood
[3:20:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> Lolorito or Teledji Aledji 2.0?
[3:20:40] <%that__tj> its gotta be a totally localized villian, no more grand catastrophy style
[3:20:40] <%JohnAtDawn> WAIT YEAH LOLORITO IS STILL THERE
[3:20:41] <+R_BChe> hoary Bould
[3:20:42] <RetributionP> what if next expansion is evil hildibrand
[3:20:47] <%JoshManVGH> A peices of shit who isn't obsessed with the WoL or fucking more Fandanial.
[3:20:47] <%SatChamp> the namedays guy is already that,
[3:20:48] <%kulmoth> So another Asahi?
[3:20:49] <+polothegreatest> with sam jetstream shit eating grin
[3:20:50] <%legendfather_of_giants> so you?
[3:20:51] <+BIumen> lolorito
[3:20:58] <+ThomasOfTroy> What if they did a crossover with blizzard and the villain was bobby kotick?
[3:20:59] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @maskedriderhero yes let me punt him across Eorzea
[3:21:00] <danraven> the entire expansion is just going to be Hildibrand
[3:21:02] <%hoodedlefty> but Pat Asahi already died
[3:21:03] <+SuperMightyGPlays> i mean fandaniel was kind of a loser
[3:21:03] <%that__tj> Teledji Aledji!
[3:21:05] <Tracazoid> Yeah Aaahi
[3:21:06] <%Kiso52> @Kiso52 IKR. wiped a couple of times on the TANKS far part of the strat
[3:21:06] <edman9677> Make Minfilia the villain
[3:21:08] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I hate lolorito so much
[3:21:09] <%InternetShis> Lolorito undercuts Tataru on the marketboard
[3:21:13] <Psyramics> so the first villain of the nin job quests
[3:21:14] <+the22cstomp> wait until you get shotgun
[3:21:19] <%shurtal> the guy from the Warrior quests that tries to take credit for killing Leviathan
[3:21:20] <Tracazoid> Asahi*
[3:21:27] <Stereotreme> @PatStaresAt what if bottom-half Omega, top-half Teledji Adeledji?
[3:21:37] <%JoshManVGH> And evil Rauban would be cool. But not like a Iylbard kind of Evil Rauban, but just a dude who wants to fuck shit up indiscriminately.
[3:21:41] <%Valdorick> Then again, Emet did imply some shit was going down in the Southern Continent. And he was like, an Emperor, so he'd know.
[3:21:43] <Shiibbae> lolorito actively makes everything one gil less on the marketboard
[3:21:53] <EngiNierXII> The Tidus slayer
[3:22:13] <edman9677> Make it Someone trying to take power in a near post apocalypse
[3:22:16] <+Nomenanza> fucking NOTHING
[3:22:22] <%Valdorick> The Towers were hyped up to NOTHING
[3:22:23] <%hoodedlefty> omg yes the Tidus slayer
[3:22:23] <%Solareon_> Red Herring: The Expansion
[3:22:24] <%InternetShis> Lolorito is the bot on Louisoix
[3:22:25] <Raz_Pataz> same with the garlean capital
[3:22:25] <edman9677> Sin as a villain again
[3:22:27] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt it's a ff4 reference through and through
[3:22:28] <metalsiren31> BOY DIDN'T IT
[3:22:28] <EngiNierXII> The towers were a distraction!
[3:22:30] <Tracazoid> A bump in the roa
[3:22:31] <%maskedriderhero> The towers as a whole were fucking nothing yet stood out the most
[3:22:33] <Shiibbae> it was all a RUSE
[3:22:34] <clumsydemiurge> it was an excuse to have more ff4 music
[3:22:34] <EndCrawler> they baited us with the towers
[3:22:35] <%kainhighwind1990> it still means more than the mine dungeon in ShB
[3:22:37] <%maskedriderhero> It was such a huge bait switch
[3:22:38] <Zetchryn> "SUCH A BIG VICTORY!"  *two hours later it's completely meaningless*
[3:22:40] <%cappyd33> pat they used it to power zodiark
[3:22:43] <$StrawberryPantsu> THEY NEED TO GET RID OF BASE LEVEL CURES
[3:22:46] <%InternetShis> 6.0 was SO DENSE
[3:22:52] <%Alazull> It meant exactly as much as it needed to
[3:22:54] <%InternetShis> WE KILLED SATAN IN ACT 1
[3:23:12] <%that__tj> Then we killed SUPER SATAN
[3:23:13] <Ahack13> They thought about the towers at the end of the last expansion and then said "Nah"
[3:23:24] <%cappyd33> oh no this is the no spoiler stream
[3:23:28] <+Nomenanza> ye they explicitly state that the towers are used for a different purpose entirely
[3:23:32] <%InternetShis> 6.0 was Ishikawa's Wild Ride
[3:23:33] <+Ilpala> The towers were a........distaction
[3:23:36] <Shiibbae> and then at the end Cerberus still wanted a peace
[3:23:37] <Kain5707> the whole expansion was a huge Jebaited
[3:23:37] <metalsiren31> The 83 dungeon boss was ridiculous too
[3:23:40] <Shiibbae> piece(
[3:24:02] <TheTakkster> This was a shocker of a first boss, complexity wise
[3:24:02] <%JoshManVGH> The towers served a solid purpose. Just not what we were expecting.
[3:24:12] <%BioHunter> BioHunter subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[3:24:14] <%kainhighwind1990> Anyone else surprised that Bard got buffed so hard?
[3:24:15] <clumsydemiurge> why does the midboss theme go so hard this expansion
[3:24:20] <%InternetShis> If there's one thing I can say... it's not Rise of Skywalker fast
[3:24:21] <%Mantorok06> aeroDance aeroDance aeroDance
[3:24:26] <+Nomenanza> I still have no idea whether it is of any benefit to kill other sisters in the final fight
[3:24:27] <Kain5707> no bard needed it
[3:24:28] <%Valdorick> Like, I at least thought the dungeons would have like... stayed around. Been 6.1 content.
[3:24:32] <%Alazull> Yeah I did this on SMN earlier, missed a lot of shit just because I'm only familiar with tanking
[3:24:35] <%Valdorick> Erm, Towers, not dungeons.
[3:24:39] <Raz_Pataz> credit to the fact that the launch trailer was deceptive as fuck too
[3:24:46] <Fathuran> Yeah it's always jarring to go from career tank to anything else at all. Personally I tend to miss the EYE mechanics as a DPS because it's not right in my face versus when I tank LUL
[3:24:53] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Some jammin music to this dungeon
[3:25:03] <Kain5707> @Nomenanza if you dont focus mindy she revives the others
[3:25:13] <%InternetShis> Chat now that I'm finally here for up to date content, should I boost Dark Knight or do the 30-90 grind?
[3:25:16] <Kain5707> cindy*
[3:25:17] <Shiibbae> i just noticed that the ground is b r e a t h i n g
[3:25:19] <+Ilpala> @Raz_Pataz Yo I literally just noticed the other day how the tower was still visible during the Estinien Final Days shot and it super shouldn't be it's gone by that point
[3:25:20] <%RealThiele> tank privilege over
[3:25:30] <mor3gan> yea this game has really nice music and like no one talks about it? I've never heard its praises
[3:25:37] <orogenesis> i kinda wish we got a proper trial for magus sisters and anima but i understand the 2 trials we have now make more sense
[3:25:49] <+Nomenanza> @Kain5707 yeah I know. Just thinking if you maybe can split the damage to kill the rest faster maybe
[3:25:52] <%Valdorick> Who knows, maybe we'll go into the Void one day and find the towers, just chilling.
[3:25:53] <+SuperMightyGPlays> dungeon midboss theme is better than dungeon boss theme
[3:25:53] <Raz_Pataz> @Ilpala oh wow that's insane
[3:25:58] <%InternetShis> Cause if I do the 30-90 grind, it's gonna be 8-mans or bust cause I am NOT being the main tank as a DRK
[3:26:27] <Kain5707> @Nomenanza i think when she assizes it heals them but im not 100% sure on that
[3:26:29] <draca23> I love the Magus Sister fight later. So freakin nuts for a novice tank like me.
[3:26:56] <%Valdorick> VULN'D
[3:26:59] <+Ilpala> ded
[3:27:03] <%that__tj> true dps mode
[3:27:04] <%NopeBadguy> dead
[3:27:08] <%Retinolgaming> psaSmug
[3:27:10] <+Nomenanza> @Kain5707 ahh I actually never noticed the assize
[3:27:11] <%NopeBadguy> this dungeon is gatekeeping for msq skip
[3:27:11] <citerel> oh i just noticed you can see what element she transmutes oh her bar
[3:27:12] <%InternetShis> toddllamaFunStack
[3:27:12] <%NopeBadguy> change my mi
[3:27:15] <%NopeBadguy> mi
[3:27:17] <@CreepyPorpoise> skanky boots for the bun boy
[3:27:18] <TheTakkster> Balls exposed
[3:27:18] <%NopeBadguy> GODDAMMIT
[3:27:19] <%NopeBadguy> mind
[3:27:23] <%InternetShis> mi
[3:27:23] <%JGardner03> The Bio / Fire wombo combo
[3:27:27] <%Valdorick> Look at those Stripper Boots for your buny boi

[3:27:29] <%that__tj> TheTrueLegendPat
[3:27:31] <Fathuran> Yay heels
[3:27:32] <Ahack13> MCH needs Bayo heels
[3:27:33] <ohno778> jesus...
[3:27:42] <Kain5707> @Nomenanza yea i just noticed it today actually aoe is assize i kept thinking it was the healer
[3:28:05] <%Dakuu75> question: is it possible to macro the "Join" command for party finder?
[3:28:15] <%Dakuu75> -or duty finder, rather
[3:28:42] <gespenst25> does anyone find it odd that we invaded Stepunk Russia in the winter and got away with it?
[3:28:58] <Kain5707> is stream buffering for anyone else by the way?
[3:29:10] <gespenst25> steam
[3:29:11] <%JGardner03> Press R to Reload for the crit
[3:29:15] <+ThomasOfTroy> Fibe for me
[3:29:20] <Fathuran> @Dakuu75 I could be wrong, but I don't think so by default. Maybe there is an addon in the 3rd party launcher for it, but I haven't looked for it myself.
[3:29:20] <%hoodedlefty> just unlocked flight in all zones
[3:29:22] <+ThomasOfTroy> Fine*
[3:29:30] <%Dakuu75> @Kain5707 here'n there yeah. Twitch probably being a little fucky
[3:29:55] <%Ebonyglow> yeah it seems fixed now
[3:30:00] <Kain5707> @Kain5707 its only happening for Pat streams i have Jerma on my other screen and its fine
[3:30:01] <Blank9> scatter shot is mostly better because it builds heat, crossbow is def better than flamethrower
[3:30:04] <Raz_Pataz> no one's talking about it so I imagine so
[3:30:06] <Kain5707> so im not sur
[3:30:10] <Kain5707> sure
[3:30:10] <Fathuran> I DC'd and crashed in the middle of Smileton. Chill group too... but at least the queue is going fast.
[3:30:15] <TheTakkster> Currently 266 waiting to get into faerie
[3:30:22] <Ash_Harden> Seeing BLM use transmute is killing my soul
[3:30:28] <%Retinolgaming> I saw 4 players D/c from the game leaving a cutscene in MSQ roulette today.
[3:30:53] <%W1nterTitan> There's something weird about watching some play 14 while im in MSQ in 14
[3:31:18] <Raz_Pataz> if it had numbers for its damage ticks it'd feel better to use
[3:31:31] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt which class has the best animations in your opinion?
[3:31:42] <mor3gan> man I can't wait till 16
[3:31:46] <+quackisalive> I'm a sprout in the msq playing 14 17 mins in and still no tanks or healers
[3:32:10] <%croxeye> finished EW today, can't wait to start extremes
[3:32:10] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:32:24] <DejaraUndead> nothing like watching one of my favourite content creators while maxing my last crafter
[3:32:24] <%Agami23> man, i saw some people who were confused as to why the magus sisters werent bug girls in this
[3:32:30] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Rip
[3:32:30] <%Koopardon> Man, the fact that ARR big fish can just decide to fuck off after biting is the highest tier of bullshit. I'm in lv90 full crafted gear for fuck's sake
[3:32:39] <TheTakkster> Can we please go one boss fight without seeing pat's balls?
[3:32:41] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Is there a particular animation that made you fall in love with a job? I knew I would be a DRG main forever once I saw the Nastrond jump/stab animation
[3:33:20] <%SolidusRex> The mid dungeon boss music is somehow better than the end of dungeon boss music this time around
[3:33:45] <+Nomenanza> eh the final dungeon theme fits better
[3:34:22] <Raz_Pataz> god I wish DRK got an upgraded animation to their combo finisher
[3:34:26] <+FZeroDMX> The first two dungeons in EW are kinda ehh
[3:34:49] <$yeknomlive> does the kill order for cindy mindy and sandy matter?
[3:35:14] <%SolidusRex> Pat confirmed to be an underpants gnome
[3:35:20] <%NopeBadguy> all the better to shit yourself in
[3:35:22] <+Deosier> cindy first since she can rez the others
[3:35:23] <@CreepyPorpoise> Yeah, Cindy needs to die first or she raises the other two
[3:35:24] <+Nomenanza> some good old HW animations
[3:35:30] <asagi_ryuu> man i fucking loved Dark Knight's Scourge animation
[3:35:31] <draca23> Summoner
[3:35:38] <@QueequegTheater> oo
[3:35:40] <@QueequegTheater> *oof
[3:36:10] <%Alazull> I remember you showing that off to Liam
[3:36:24] <Srthunda> are you serious?
[3:36:28] <%DianaTheAscian> Pat.
[3:36:30] <%Jeemukun> I should level MCH sometime
[3:36:50] <+Melthius36> shouldn't chainsaw be an insta kill?
[3:36:50] <Srthunda> I paid attention to all of them
[3:36:51] <%DianaTheAscian> I paid attention
[3:36:56] <%Agami23> i mean, bio is a DoT in every final fantasy
[3:36:57] <Srthunda> even the ones I didnt like
[3:37:02] <Daniel_Is_I> Pat "read your godddamn abilities" Boivin
[3:37:06] <%2DSuperiority> I know every job and am the coolest
[3:37:09] <GilliamYaeger> This dungeon has AMAZING weapons
[3:37:09] <%Valdorick> Only pay attention to the classes you care about.
[3:37:11] <%croxeye> I leveled monk to 80, still have no idea on how to play monk lol
[3:37:12] <Raz_Pataz> ooh yeah that power slash animation is slick
[3:37:14] <%PauliusMaximus> the PLD weapons here are really cool
[3:37:15] <@QueequegTheater> Read your tooltips Pat Kappa
[3:37:17] <%CzeekyTV> just read your tooltips 4Head
[3:37:19] <%PauliusMaximus> i love them
[3:37:19] <%croxeye> but i main tanks anyways so whatevs lol
[3:37:35] <+Nomenanza> I always prefer to roll on sword for glam, as my PLD shield is always invisible
[3:37:50] <%DianaTheAscian> What???
[3:37:52] <%Nobrev> new acceleration on red mage is so weird. I don't know where to use it properly
[3:37:52] <+ThomasOfTroy> In the Pat Porp divorce, I pick porp, for the record
[3:38:02] <%CzeekyTV> Thrill of Battle isn't a lie
[3:38:04] <@CreepyPorpoise> Aww!
[3:38:06] <@CreepyPorpoise> thanks Thomas
[3:38:09] <%Agami23> have you seen the tool tip for shellton? its the worst
[3:38:10] <@CreepyPorpoise> creepy49Glee
[3:38:14] <Raz_Pataz> gief has escaped containment
[3:38:16] <%that__tj> afk right before the boss? Kick isntantly
[3:38:19] <$yeknomlive> i remember sword oath tooltip just confusing me
[3:39:22] <+ThomasOfTroy> creepy49Glee right back at you
[3:39:57] <Raz_Pataz> nailed it
[3:40:00] <%that__tj> PLD is fucking me up currently, since i never really played him. Casting Requicast 15 second BEFORE you even use a single holy spirit is so unintuitive
[3:40:13] <%Valdorick> Look at Pat, NOT dancing
[3:40:14] <$yeknomlive> it's tradition that the person who is afk has to sprint pull the boss
[3:41:09] <$Galeont> May seem strange to say Pat, but I'm really digging how the stone wall behind you looks.
[3:41:32] <%SveriSageAdvice> yes lmao
[3:41:34] <Raz_Pataz> nah he's too fast for us to hear
[3:41:37] <%Visorak6> Not over music and pews
[3:41:37] <%that__tj> He is become Powerful
[3:41:50] <%thedankestmeeme> hey pat what do I do with bicolor gems?
[3:42:05] <ohno778> zoomies
[3:42:07] <%InternetShis> Spiid
[3:42:12] <%kainhighwind1990> is this prob the hardest dungeon boss in the game?
[3:42:15] <%SveriSageAdvice> i have my headphones on, so maybe that does let me hear Zangief's stomp-a-romp easier lol
[3:42:20] <%that__tj> @thedankestmeeme trade them in for mats and make money/ craft with them
[3:42:26] <%InternetShis> "Why we goin' so fuckin FAST? WOAAAAAAAH!"
[3:42:30] <Raz_Pataz> delta attack is just information overload LUL
[3:42:33] <%legendfather_of_giants> @thedankestmeeme buy skins to help you level leatherworker
[3:42:44] <Fathuran> It's EVERYTHING: The Boss fight
[3:42:45] <ohno778> kill the fat one
[3:42:46] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt this boss is here to gatekeep everyone who skippe
[3:42:53] <%Tearonex> Holy shit THESE 3 are in the game!!
[3:42:54] <%InternetShis> Just stand next to your Trusts Kappa
[3:43:01] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Prepare for running away from things
[3:43:14] <%thedankestmeeme> @thedankestmeeme where?
[3:43:22] <Raz_Pataz> this looks like a BLM's fever nightmare
[3:43:25] <+Ilpala> How many people killed one of the other two first just to see if they had the balls to have her rez them?
[3:43:41] <%Valdorick> @Raz_Pataz Umbral Soul will fix it.
[3:43:42] <%legendfather_of_giants> @thedankestmeeme there's a trader near one of the aetherytes in every ShB and EW zone
[3:43:46] <%thedankestmeeme> @legendfather_of_giants where I get leathers
[3:44:11] <%legendfather_of_giants> @thedankestmeeme there's a hide from every zone that LTW will need, just buy them as you need them
[3:44:14] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @ilpala my first run through we killed both the other sisters first then all were sad when they got res
[3:44:15] <Raz_Pataz> @Valdorick ol' faithful
[3:44:22] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Raz_Pataz it is, I trusted this yesterday
[3:44:25] <Comb711> @Ilpala My first time through we didn't realize and killed the two sisters once each
[3:44:50] <+Catpurnicus> wonder why they switched out Cindy's axe for a scythe
[3:45:36] <+the22cstomp> @Catpurnicus because the scythe can be coded as a whm weapon, but there's no axe model for a whm weapon
[3:45:36] <Raz_Pataz> @legendfather_of_giants my sympathies
[3:45:50] <+Ilpala> damn that's rough you two

[3:59:51] <Arbeh> Ive still got a soft spot for this one but maybe thats stockholm syndrome from ARR
[3:59:56] <MKII> the hard version is worse with the lamp oil
[3:59:56] <%Alazull> Oh I just did this
[4:00:09] <Ginganinja4545> this is the worst one because you gotta hurt the tonberrys T~T
[4:00:09] <@SpaceCapnCrone> these old dungeons feel kinda weird and aimless in places
[4:00:10] <Kain5707> they do like 100 damage now LUL
[4:00:12] <%that__tj> oh yeah King Tonberry was ROUGH
[4:00:15] <+Nomenanza> oh right this is normal wanderer's
[4:00:16] <Comb711> This is maybe the funniest dungeon though
[4:00:21] <+keiji_maede> Yeayeayeayeayea!!
[4:00:21] <+Fetrigon> ah :(
[4:00:40] <MKII> shouldnt we look for a cure to tonberrynes
[4:00:41] <+IAmAkiva> other dps is viewing cutscene
[4:00:48] <%Birdigalore> so if the little Tonberries used to be lalafel, what are the big tonberries?

[4:00:58] <@SpaceCapnCrone> creepy49Uhhh
[4:01:09] <+IAmAkiva> i've been had
[4:01:30] <%thelaxinator> is that guy's name actually Viewing Cutscene?
[4:01:38] <+IAmAkiva> Yes
[4:01:46] <%Animatic_> godlike
[4:01:49] <+Nomenanza> god that is silly
[4:01:53] <metalsiren31> Oh I've seen that guy
[4:01:59] <%Valdorick> 10/10
[4:02:17] <Kain5707> hes kinda famous
[4:02:18] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:02:21] <xDartuzax> Have a guy with a similar name in my FC lol
[4:02:29] <+Catpurnicus> sorry, I'm Viewing Cutscene
[4:02:44] <%brisk_dacat> Name yourself X to continue
[4:02:50] <Kain5707> next week
[4:02:54] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat, do you think you check Blasphemous final update? There's a bunch of new stuff and a sequel on the way
[4:02:56] <Kain5707> balance patch
[4:02:56] <+BroderQuinho> So is this game better suited for controller or mouse + keyboard?
[4:02:57] <+keiji_maede> Oh! They need to look at Reaper already
[4:02:59] <+Nomenanza> next week is normal Pandemonium apparently
[4:03:00] <+killer_squid1990> Nah, they added Energy Drain back to scholar before Savage
[4:03:07] <metalsiren31> Maybe some potency changes with 6.05
[4:03:08] <Kain5707> always before savage though
[4:03:12] <Arbeh> I think they usually do a little tuning with Savage but nothing big big before 6.1?
[4:03:19] <@SpaceCapnCrone> 90k'd
[4:03:24] <@SpaceCapnCrone> creepy49Uhhh
[4:03:32] <%thelaxinator> Energy Drain doesn't give MP anymore, really rustles the jimmies
[4:03:54] <quigley_plays> yeah they very reaerly do anything more than potency changes outside of full patches
[4:03:57] <+Fetrigon> 90k'd?
[4:03:59] <%transporterthesequel> Honestly, they can change what they want with Reaper. On demand damage buff for everyone and no target teleport makes it a disgusting Raid melee.
[4:04:02] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Oh no its happening again
[4:04:11] <%JGardner03> 90k incoming
[4:04:31] <Kain5707> bring his insta kill back SE
[4:04:31] <%thelaxinator> guys I've been in this chi waiting party for 6 hours please help
[4:04:43] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Server kicks incomming Notlikethis
[4:04:47] <Kain5707> supposed DDOS attack
[4:04:54] <+Nomenanza> @transporterthesequel eh its personal DPS is actually still lower than BLM and SAM. I don't think changes are necessary
[4:04:59] <@CreepyPorpoise> I did it
[4:05:03] <@CreepyPorpoise> I farmed FATEs
[4:05:09] <%JoshManVGH> What is Chi?
[4:05:10] <+R_BChe> what about sitting for hours in queue
[4:05:10] <%Agami23> doing fates while waiting for chi
[4:05:11] <%afronooch> farming fates and leveling mining while I'm waitubg
[4:05:12] <Daniel_Is_I> It's pronounced "key"
[4:05:13] <%Visorak6> You dont pay my sub
[4:05:13] <%InternetShis> No
[4:05:17] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Chi drops tokens for the Level checker/cheater mount
[4:05:20] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt there's no better time because we can sit around while levelling craf
[4:05:21] <+quackisalive> Queue finally popped after one hour and the MSQ fight took under 1 min to do
[4:05:23] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I already have my main at 572
[4:05:23] <Arbeh> its basically a chat room of shared misery waiting
[4:05:24] <%Kise77> farming fates is a bit hard when your attacks miss a lot
[4:05:24] <+Nomenanza> @JoshManVGH super fate that gives a TV mount
[4:05:25] <%croxeye> im doing RL stuff while waiting for Chi
[4:05:26] <+quackisalive> GREAT
[4:05:27] <+Ilpala> I'm focusing on omni-crafter first
[4:05:28] <+BlubRobe> I need the fancy mount tho, even if I'm just gonna use Best Dog instead
[4:05:30] <+Fetrigon> @creepyporpoise congrats
[4:05:37] <%InternetShis> But you have to BE THERE
[4:05:38] <@SpaceCapnCrone> 472 queue aint too bad
[4:06:02] <%Agami23> one person in the instance i was in was doing art of peoples characters for people to kill time
[4:06:05] <@CreepyPorpoise> Thanks, but it was still mostly luck I was able to get the two, tbh.
[4:06:09] <%Mekhet09> Doing ex and the party leader dcd
[4:06:13] <%Mekhet09> Fun night
[4:06:18] <MKII> maybe the anti afk botters got booted and havent rejoined
[4:06:27] <+RobotCo_Op> 48 raiders from RobotCo_Op have joined! 
[4:06:38] <%SatChamp> the problem is that there's a dedicated enough playerbase sitting there and waiting, that if you have any desire to do it, you gotta sit there with them so you're actually able to do the thing you want to
[4:06:39] <+Makouzer> @patstaresat what changes are you expecting on the first balancing patch in terms of jobs?
[4:07:02] <theinfamousq> FFXI playthrough when
[4:07:02] <spencer_zero> 48? That's enough for a Castrum raid.
[4:07:12] <Kain5707> WAR buff
[4:07:14] <@QueequegTheater> @SatChamp I legit expect Bloodwhetting heal potency to get nerfed
[4:07:15] <+R_BChe> reaper nerfs for su
[4:07:16] <%joodatious> nerf darknight
[4:07:24] <quigley_plays> pal single target buff
[4:07:32] <%Fenrirlives> @patstaresat alright man! gotta get back to work! have a great evening! üß°
[4:07:35] <spencer_zero> Buff DRK
[4:07:36] <%Valdorick> No, tone it UP, make it MORE absurd.
[4:07:40] <ElyaEuphoria> PLD dps increase probably
[4:07:49] <Daniel_Is_I> Carve and Spit not having a heal is so stupid. They gave Abyssal the mana regain.
[4:07:52] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Are you surprised Bard got buffed so much?
[4:07:53] <%thelaxinator> Sage having an on-demand cure 2 equivalent that doesn't cost meter or a cooldown would be nice
[4:07:53] <%W1nterTitan> Give DRK a lovely hat
[4:07:56] <%Solareon_> Carve and Spit now CONSUMES MP
[4:07:57] <%Agami23> give DRK a new mitigation to let them do the perfect block shit
[4:07:59] <%InternetShis> Give Dark Knight literally anything bigger and it would be better
[4:08:01] <Kain5707> they might keep PLD at where it is
[4:08:03] <%Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt Dark knight is actually the best tank DPS now.
[4:08:05] <+keiji_maede> TBN needs to fucking heal you if it don't break
[4:08:06] <+R_BChe> dead living
[4:08:06] <Kain5707> since its super ranged no
[4:08:15] <%Retinolgaming> Do you heal much pat?
[4:08:21] <%Valdorick> We need to hit World of Warcraft levels of balance, where the absolute best Survival Hunter is still 50% worse than the most dogshit Shadow Priest.
[4:08:23] <@CreepyPorpoise> just dont die then forehead
[4:08:25] <Kain5707> now*
[4:08:26] <%InternetShis> Living Dead more like Living WHM
[4:08:27] <+FapCentral> FapCentral subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[4:08:37] <Daniel_Is_I> I hope they do a mid-expansion rework of DRK
[4:08:42] <%Mekhet09> pld is 10% less.
[4:08:42] <+Valison> gunbreaker is less survivable
[4:08:43] <%thedankestmeeme> GNB pretty high
[4:08:55] <+Makouzer> is PLD dps really that bad? I main PLD and have 575ilvl and it doesn't feel that bad
[4:08:57] <%Agami23> pld is blue healer now, so thats good
[4:08:58] <Kain5707> WAR needs a dps buff
[4:09:04] <+Makouzer> in terms of dps
[4:09:16] <%InternetShis> DPS is not the deciding factor for a tank, even still, GNB has enough all-rounder skills to be a better main tank than DRK with self healing AND A NEW COOLDOWN
[4:09:22] <draca23> Tank dps is really not important when the Tank doesn't survive...
[4:09:23] <Drega707> DRK only really suffers in dungeons tbh.
[4:09:36] <Kain5707> PLD is ranged magic now
[4:09:44] <%InternetShis> DRK has 0 DPS
[4:09:48] <%Agami23> DRK suffers in fun
[4:09:49] <%DeRedBaron> fun, needs fun, needs fun
[4:09:50] <metalsiren31> Dungeons are what 90% of players do
[4:09:53] <%croxeye> DRK suffers from not having self healing
[4:09:55] <Daniel_Is_I> You don't like 10% DR?
[4:10:02] <%croxeye> and it's great mitigation costing mp
[4:10:07] <Comb711> I'm glad scholar ended up very fun :)
[4:10:08] <Arbeh> Heart of Corundum on GNB is a serotonin hit every 20 seconds its unreal
[4:10:14] <+Blank_Point> Heart of Corundum is SO good
[4:10:15] <%Buttlo> What do people feel about monk?
[4:10:20] <%NopeBadguy> NOW YOU HAVE A UNIQUE O
[4:10:23] <%NopeBadguy> ONE
[4:10:24] <Psyramics> I just leveled all 3 tanks but PLD, DRK was easily my least favorite
[4:10:24] <%NopeBadguy> AGAIN
[4:10:25] <%Retinolgaming> I feel like sage probably deserves a nerf, but won't for a while cuz they want people to heal.
[4:10:26] <+keiji_maede> Can they kill "Dark mind" please!!!
[4:10:28] <%Kise77> SB DRK was the best
[4:10:39] <%NopeBadguy> NOW YOU HAVE REPIRSAL
[4:10:40] <%joodatious> monk is fun I enjoy having combos
[4:10:41] <Jariu> Well that's because DRK deleted PLD form the game in HW LUL
[4:10:41] <%NopeBadguy> AND REPRISAL 2
[4:10:42] <@QueequegTheater> Tank DPS is only noticeable when actively parsing, so a DPS boost is not worth beign made of paper
[4:10:43] <draca23> Everyone got cool new stuff to add to their tactics and changes encounters, and Dark Knight got...uhm...
[4:10:44] <+Valison> DRK being unfun is 100% true, it's nice that it's strong rn but its just so boring
[4:10:48] <Daniel_Is_I> TBN should just not cost mana and also make your next few abilities heal on pop.
[4:10:50] <+IAmAkiva> DARK KNIGHT MORE LIKE DARK SHITE AAAAAAAASCREAM
[4:10:50] <%InternetShis> I'm just gonna wait for the innevitable hotfix, and if we don't get anything by 6.5, I'm buying a skip
[4:10:51] <metalsiren31> I honestly miss Stormblood DRK
[4:10:55] <+SaphronBlackbourne> XIV with Xbox buttons feels weird
[4:10:57] <%CalderGaming> High Reprisal Kappa
[4:11:00] <BobbyHopp> they should remake drk like rpr and let you do combos with fray
[4:11:01] <%Agami23> they should make it so your living shadow also does your mitigations to double mitigate
[4:11:03] <%Visorak6> "stop pissing on me and telling me it's raining"
[4:11:08] <%croxeye> C&S & abyssal drain did NOT need to share a CD
[4:11:11] <%luftraumm1> drk feels a bit flimsy
[4:11:12] <KnivesEve> Dark knight? more like Sad Knight
[4:11:19] <%thelaxinator> Dark needs better mouthfeel
[4:11:19] <Comb711> The buttons are good but they feel bad
[4:11:20] <metalsiren31> ME TOO
[4:11:29] <%legendfather_of_giants> i hear people liked Corridor
[4:11:30] <ElyaEuphoria> the shadowbringer skill feels like it should be a gcd like sonic break
[4:11:37] <+Fetrigon> bro just don't mess up. EZ
[4:11:39] <theinfamousq> this song is giving me some chrono cross vibes
[4:11:41] <+Uttrik> and every old school warrior still misses butcher's block
[4:11:43] <+Fetrigon> lmao
[4:11:44] <Arbeh> Their DoT back in heavensward was so cool. Best animation
[4:11:45] <%SwdVengeance> Has it been said that the Radz-at-Han post MSQ music slaps hard
[4:11:48] <Azure_Storm> As someone who dropped Dark Knight I still laugh at Enhanced Mend
[4:11:48] <%Alazull> @thelaxinator Why is no one talking about the mouthfeel?
[4:11:49] <draca23> Make it so that it is, at least, on par with the others.
[4:11:50] <%senorpapel> Class can be good and still not feel good. Look at lvl 70 pld
[4:11:55] <Azure_Storm> Unmend8
[4:11:56] <+Makouzer> @patstaresat what do you feel about melding direct hit for tanks?
[4:12:02] <%joodatious> its a cool top
[4:12:09] <Kain5707> 70 PLD is good now
[4:12:13] <%DeRedBaron> Oblation would be far less of an issue about it being straight forward and boring, IF they actually got or had something fun
[4:12:18] <%Agami23> not enough tiddy being out
[4:12:23] <%thelaxinator> art of war 2 on scholar feels so... nothing
[4:12:26] <$StrawberryPantsu> @PatStaresAt How do you get your Job Action set to R2+R3?
[4:12:28] <%kainhighwind1990> ...I just realized that there isn't a Roeg Scion
[4:12:50] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> i miss bane on sch so much
[4:12:51] <monsuraught> you have abs now instead of being a smooth boy
[4:12:55] <@QueequegTheater> @Makouzer Don't do it for WAR
[4:12:56] <+Makouzer> direct hit is not good later? what does that mean?
[4:13:04] <Kain5707> watch Xenosys video on DRK he has good idea
[4:13:07] <@QueequegTheater> WAR has tons of guaranteed DCrits
[4:13:08] <$Hommando> @kainhighwind1990 Hoary
[4:13:09] <@JustinianKnight> make it reflect damage back some lol
[4:13:18] <%JGardner03> Man I just went back to look at Power Slash, that animation WAS really good
[4:13:19] <+Alegut_Stinkyfarts> just slap regen on oblation and we'd be good
[4:13:20] <Jariu> @kainhighwind1990 What about my man Hoary Boulder
[4:13:20] <cherrycottontail> does anyone else hear gorillaz rock the house at that part
[4:13:20] <@QueequegTheater> So pump crit damage, then determination
[4:13:21] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt
[4:13:26] <DejaraUndead> i heard someones idea for drk was to have it lean more into its archatype idea with TBN with some other kinds of health shields for its mitigation
[4:13:26] <Gloppie> I think WAR is just Crit>det right?
[4:13:28] <%NopeBadguy> goddammit
[4:13:28] <%joodatious> @kainhighwind1990 isn't hoary boulder a scion?
[4:13:29] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> bloodbath should be on tanks and DPSs
[4:13:30] <%transporterthesequel> It doesn't help that WAR took all of DRK's possible thematic abilities.
[4:13:31] <%NopeBadguy> CHI POP i2
[4:13:34] <%DeRedBaron> off tank
[4:13:36] <@QueequegTheater> @Gloppie yes
[4:13:38] <%thelaxinator> Dark Knight actually lost some self healing since you can't use carve and spit and abyssal drain back to back now
[4:13:38] <Daniel_Is_I> Revenge tank!
[4:13:42] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt CHI POP i2
[4:13:43] <%senorpapel> @makouzer  scales weirdly, as the expac goes on you‚Äôll get more dh from stats?
[4:13:45] <@QueequegTheater> WAR melds weird compared to other tanks
[4:13:45] <+JackDemon316> give it a percent health gain
[4:13:47] <%walternatorz> tbn?
[4:13:49] <metalsiren31> The way to fix Oblation is turn it back into Sole Survivor
[4:13:50] <%JohnAtDawn> Blackest Night
[4:13:51] <ElyaEuphoria> blood weapon should give HP, it literally has BLOOD in the name
[4:13:51] <+Makouzer> @queequegtheater well that much I know thx for the advice still
[4:13:55] <%Agami23> make your shield thorn-ey so it pops damage back to them
[4:14:05] <%legendfather_of_giants> dead when you get there i bet
[4:14:05] <Kain5707> DRK just needs life steal
[4:14:07] <%walternatorz> omicron base
[4:14:08] <%kainhighwind1990> @kainhighwind1990 I meant like important-appears-in-every-cutscene scions lol
[4:14:09] <%joodatious> Roegs suck so its good that they aren't a main scion
[4:14:12] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt So dread spikes from XI basically, counter on damage and get health back?
[4:14:13] <+Ghazarban> goof luck getting in the intance
[4:14:16] <%thelaxinator> yeah good luck buddy
[4:14:17] <+Makouzer> @patstaresat you think skillspeed is less important for tanks now?
[4:14:19] <MKII> rip
[4:14:19] <Ash_Harden> keep trying
[4:14:21] <ElyaEuphoria> Jebaited
[4:14:22] <cherrycottontail> won't be up when you get there
[4:14:22] <Gloppie> IM 4 IN QUEUE WAIT FOR ME ON CHI

[4:15:57] <@JustinianKnight> I think they shouldnt wait
[4:16:05] <%SveriSageAdvice> Im sensing a Powerful Mark in Elpis right now?
[4:16:05] <Srthunda> I wish these bosses spawned more often
[4:16:09] <%thelaxinator> good ol' diadem chat
[4:16:10] <+Krivvan> the real meta is to do your crafting on the platform when the % is high
[4:16:11] <DejaraUndead> people wait cause they are crazy
[4:16:13] <%joodatious> Chi hunters are fools
[4:16:14] <+Nomenanza> yup
[4:16:18] <%W1nterTitan> Wow.
[4:16:20] <%Agami23> jesus
[4:16:20] <pissdegaulle> shoulda played tank
[4:16:23] <+Nomenanza> cuz some just camp in center like assholes
[4:16:23] <+Fetrigon> LUL
[4:16:23] <+Makouzer> @patstaresat when you said on the podcast that this game is now one of the best games in your life, what games are you comparing this to in your mind?
[4:16:24] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Diadem chat to the max
[4:16:24] <%Divryne> Sucks to be bad at DPS
[4:16:24] <%W1nterTitan> What a waste of time
[4:16:25] <%JoshManVGH> So it's impossible to farm right now, got it
[4:16:25] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat I've been waiting for 3 days now it's not worth it
[4:16:25] <haisho> OOF
[4:16:27] <@QueequegTheater> lmao
[4:16:28] <%Agami23> the mount is so cool though
[4:16:33] <%croxeye> cuz shiny mount
[4:16:40] <%joodatious> funny yellow dog
[4:16:40] <%croxeye> i think is the thinking
[4:16:41] <%2DSuperiority> BLMs be sure to use your tripecasts as soon as possible
[4:16:42] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> i should know i got those weapons from that big fight from fiediem
[4:16:46] <+mokla12> glad I got it already XD
[4:16:47] <Psyramics> yeah, you gotta be right on it when itn spawns
[4:16:47] <%senorpapel> What if every hit drk took fray would counterattack. Or maybe he could store up damage and do a big burst at the end?
[4:16:49] <%transporterthesequel> Oh I'm at the 1 of doom.
[4:16:50] <MKII> I kinda wish they did what GW2 does and made a predictable spawn schedule
[4:16:53] <%thelaxinator> it's just fomo mind goblins
[4:17:03] <%Kogashiwakai> i waited for 2 hours the other day cause i saw people waiting and just ended up doing fates while it was not spawing
[4:17:07] <Comb711> did you level up sch or smn?
[4:17:15] <@JustinianKnight> they had people leave and forgot
[4:17:17] <@JustinianKnight> yea
[4:17:18] <Kain5707> did you do fairy beast tribe?
[4:17:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lmao
[4:17:22] <%JoshManVGH> @senorpapel incorporating Esteem more would be hella cool.
[4:17:24] <%SveriSageAdvice> Sensing a Powerful Mark on specifically Instance 1 of Elpis in Ultros right now, anyone know what that is?
[4:17:36] <%JhinBappo> Hello today!
[4:17:39] <%Visorak6> First level 80 crafter fuckin phew.
[4:17:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> Ophineous
[4:17:45] <@QueequegTheater> @SveriSageAdvice I think those are SS marks
[4:17:46] <haisho> an S rank hunt probably
[4:17:47] <%transporterthesequel> There are multiple!@
[4:17:48] <MKII> @SveriSageAdvice that means theres an S rank in that zone
[4:17:48] <+Krivvan> @SveriSageAdvice that's the message for an S rank in the zone
[4:17:50] <%Valdorick> There' many fates in the bunny zone
[4:17:52] <Ash_Harden> SourPls
[4:17:55] <adelym0> oh god you're using that horrid beast for a mount
[4:17:58] <%Agami23> oh hey, i know the person who had that party. they do huge amounts of commissions
[4:17:59] <%SveriSageAdvice> ahh ok thanks yall
[4:17:59] <SweetCuppingCake> Just flew by Pat. Were you able to get credit for Chi?
[4:18:01] <%JoshManVGH> Hell, having a button that's an Esteem based defensive ability would be grand!
[4:18:19] <%legendfather_of_giants> S rank in Elpis 1 people are saying @PatStaresAt
[4:18:21] <+Melthius36> updating party finder for fates sucks
[4:18:27] <%Valdorick> More like Try Chi but can't because its already dead.
[4:18:28] <%JoshManVGH> They block and drains health dirctly to you
[4:18:38] <%Visorak6> sacrificing the esteem to shield the raid would be pretty nuts
[4:18:40] <%SodiumPatrol> psaBig
[4:18:52] <%thelaxinator> You ever seen like 200 firebird mounts gathered into a ball? I just did and I may never see anything ever again.
[4:19:20] <%Valdorick> @thelaxinator I believe that's called a Sun.
[4:19:20] <%animaturgy> @PatStaresAt Just tanked the 81 dungeon as WAR, was the last alive for the final boss...at full health.

[4:20:59] <+Makouzer> @patstaresat I have a friend who wants to play MMOs but doesn't care for the story at all, should I just not recommend this game for him? I kinda feel that content wise this game is so heavy on the story it might not be smart to skip them
