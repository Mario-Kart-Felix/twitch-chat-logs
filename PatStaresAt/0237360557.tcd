[0:19:51] <%ssaryn> I love how the first 20-30 minutes of a stream is literally just one of them/both of them just dying.
[0:19:52] <jeangenie420> Pat's getting beat to death with that keyboard the second the camera stops recording
[0:19:58] <%breakfastmegapowers> Aww c'mon Paige, you look like dry dogshit girl! Flaunt it!

[0:20:09] <%AbnormalVoid> Most parts of Jessica Nigri are younger than she is, to be fair
[0:20:12] <%finaltrinity5> Every stream one ups the previous one in terms of degeneracy
[0:20:12] <AFlyingTaco1> Paige don't worry. 30+ year old vvomen are still sexy as fuck.
[0:20:13] <%LymanAl> That's how you say it
[0:20:15] <Prevot> So Paige, how much grease did that bag get on your hair?

[0:26:53] <$SGrim> @TyrantBelial Pat is an example to us all, the best way to stay in a relationship is to find someone worse off than you. Paige has also accomplished this, because these two are a mobius strip of fuck-ups.

[1:57:02] <MonsterEnvy> We can scew him with Haelscourge
[1:57:12] <$Ultradoom333> So is this just Fantasy L4D? If so that's rad

[1:57:40] <%Heartlander> With some level progression.
[1:57:42] <pshuuu> that turn speed
[1:57:52] <deviljhojho94> ENDLESS TRASH

[1:58:03] <$Ultradoom333> @heartlander that's fine.
[1:58:08] <%bluetocho13> open one gold box you coward
[1:58:18] <+TaterBurglar> And this is the game I'd play with friends. If I had any.
[1:58:31] <AndyTehHero> go check on your wife!
[1:58:36] <Softekan> Final level is quite buggy.
[1:58:40] <MonsterEnvy> No Haelscourge
[1:58:47] <MonsterEnvy> I wanted to see against a boss
[1:58:57] <MonsterEnvy> Fight the boss
[1:59:03] <%captainthunderwolf> Against the Grain would be more interesting if you fought a literal field full of Daemonically-influenced grain.
[1:59:05] <%captainthunderwolf> Just saying.

[1:59:48] <@WoolyFish> Nice of Clemps to narrate the game for us.
[1:59:54] <%Tnick1> Feels better to be resubbed!
[1:59:55] <%captainthunderwolf> @RedPanda493 Bright Mage is a hard carry against the fields of Daemonically-possessed wheat.
[2:00:02] <%Tnick1> When it works XD

[2:22:02] <aeonicvector> guys, lets show him how boring it can be, BUFFS EVERYWHERE
[2:22:04] <+ccwettr123> dwarf should always focus on knocking down rather than attacking
[2:22:10] <+Rabbitmage> Playing on Recruit with level 20 characters. Gosh, I wonder why its so easy. :P
[2:22:14] <+ccwettr123> unless it's slayer
[2:22:24] <%HeeeeyYouGuuuuys> Mothman did kill all those people on that bridge...
[2:22:25] <CertainlySyrix> I'm guessing you're holding onto those commendation boxes for when you're a higher level? @AngriestPat

[2:23:03] <%TaterBurglar> So, none of my friends liked the first one, but I loved it, should I still pick up Vermintide?
[2:23:11] <+Knopantz> Ah poop. Not out on console yet
[2:23:13] <%boratebuffer> In 2011, I was 2. Feel old yet?
[2:23:17] <CertainlySyrix> You should probably find some other buds to play with @TaterBurglar
[2:23:19] <@WoolyFish> These weapons are dope.
[2:23:19] <AndyTehHero> fetch me my rat slaying bat!
[2:23:22] <MonsterEnvy> It's a sword an dagger

[2:24:02] <AndyTehHero> Charlie Day for DLC
[2:24:05] <aeonicvector> alright guys, buffs ONLY make this boring for them

[2:24:18] <$undeadv13> guys
[2:24:19] <KoyaMusa> he dalyed the stream to eat
[2:24:24] <KoyaMusa> *delayed
[2:24:26] <CertainlySyrix> Veteran's not that hard if you're at least power level 200 and playing with three other competent human beings
[2:24:28] <$undeadv13> lets try and kill mothman
[2:24:47] <CertainlySyrix> Pat should be playing the dwarf
[2:24:49] <%Remery_> That dwarf waddle
[2:24:49] <%TaterBurglar> @CertainlySyrix They didn't like it cause they wanted like infinity maps a la L4D mods, so they played each map once then stopped playing. Kind of annoying
[2:24:51] <+Knopantz> What if we do nice things and give them buffs? No?
[2:24:54] <deviljhojho94> 5'2 on dick maybe
[2:24:56] <deviljhojho94> wait

[2:45:28] <%jiin6> wooo you did it
[2:45:28] <MarylandJutsu> @ghostpalacio one of pats followers donated a BUNCH to the Pillars 2 kickstarter so there is an ELMO COMPANION IN IT
[2:45:28] <BeatH7> the moment he steps in on normal, he'll be so fucked
[2:45:34] <ghostpalacio> what does the elmo do?
[2:45:35] <@WoolyFish> The Pillars streams are the ultimate podcast, I really enjoyed them.

[2:46:38] <MonsterEnvy> Into the Nest is awesome
[2:46:45] <ghostpalacio> elf milf?
[2:47:04] <MarylandJutsu> @TenderBabyBacon good. thats the way it should be
[2:47:06] <BigBlackSilvio> @AngriestPat One big tip Pat, block before you try and rez someone, it'll stop hits that would interrupt you otherwise. Game also documents this nowhere.
[2:47:09] <BeatH7> @AngriestPat if you parry before starting to revive someone, you can parry while picking them up
[2:47:10] <Sol_Install> hope paige feels better
[2:47:20] <Mylittlesony> Thanks @ghostpalacio now I gotta go to google
[2:47:22] <Sol_Install> why pat a elf now?
