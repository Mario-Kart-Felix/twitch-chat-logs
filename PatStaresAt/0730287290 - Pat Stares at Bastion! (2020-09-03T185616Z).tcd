[0:03:25] <Snark_Streams> hello
[0:03:39] <+ImpHelpSingIt> bro bastion is so fuxking good. especially when you think about how it was literally supergiants first game ever
[0:03:41] <laserbeaming> is this the first Bastion Stream?
[0:03:46] <+risenlp2> Zangief = Poochie. Change my mind
[0:03:47] <%Bailey__gaming> im in such a great mood right now i just went out to a resturant for the 1st time since the happanening it was nice to feel normalish again. also it was SO GOOD
[0:04:10] <%Bailey__gaming> Zangief is Scruff McGruff
[0:04:19] <%toolofparanoia> It's time for the Zangief and Elmo show! psaDogchamp psaWink with Pat psaWhat

[0:04:40] <%BubbaRands> "The Pat just rages for a while."
[0:04:45] <+NitronStreams> yes zangief is poochie we discovered this day one
[0:04:52] <%Albadabar> Albadabar subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 19 month streak! Hey Pat, potentially bizarre question: do you have any thoughts or opinions on Hazbin Hotel? Just saw YMS's take on the subject and was curious if you knew anything about it or even cared.
[0:04:57] <heartlesshealer> Crusader Kings? Gotta marry Glitterhoof
[0:05:06] <laserbeaming> I don't know if Pat is a Crusader Kings kind of guy
[0:05:06] <+ImpHelpSingIt> zangief is a pet squirt who follows you around the bastion
[0:05:15] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> can we add steve buscemi (the poster) to the brb
[0:05:17] <tkuwari> I notice the comment guide doesnt tell me to love Zangief
[0:05:24] <%phantomsleeves> is it worth it to give nintendo your money for that mario bundle?
[0:05:24] <%PaladinDupre> neither do i, thats why im asking
[0:05:26] <laserbeaming> Sadly, Glitterhoof is not on release for CK3 @heartlesshealer might be added later
[0:05:29] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Crusader Kings may not get along with the mind goblins.
[0:05:36] <+NitronStreams> "when ever Zangief isnt onscreen everyone should ask where's zangief"
[0:05:38] <heartlesshealer> NOOOOOOO
[0:05:48] <%YakumoYomi> He said on Twitter that he already tried Crusader Kings, and he refunded it after five minutes because of goblins
[0:05:51] <+ImpHelpSingIt> zangief is peeing
[0:05:57] <heartlesshealer> hopefully he'll be added in later like you said, @laserbeaming
[0:06:06] <laserbeaming> she*
[0:06:17] <heartlesshealer> sorry
[0:06:18] <laserbeaming> Glitterhoof is always female, IIRC
[0:06:22] <heartlesshealer> I always forget
[0:06:23] <%BubbaRands> @NitronStreams Zangief should be louder, angrier and have access to a poop machine
[0:06:30] <SubjectX07x> I would love to see him try Wasteland 3.
[0:06:38] <%toolofparanoia> @tkuwari It totally fucking should because if you don't love that fffffffffucking dog you're a BAD PERSON!
[0:06:52] <yourliteraldog> eyy jibronies

[0:11:20] <%Albadabar> He sweepi
[0:11:20] <%DedlokPM> @rumtumtugnutz he WAS going to play that on stream, but then he realized what a copyright nightmare that would be
[0:11:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> @risenlp2 is there further excuses to use the skateboard?
[0:11:24] <heartlesshealer> babies do that
[0:11:24] <%BubbaRands> Awwww he big slcheep

[0:11:29] <+risenlp2> @LiquidDinosaur Yup. it's much smaller, denser and more refined than before.
[0:11:29] <%za7az> @PatStaresAt Did you beat Pyre?

[0:11:40] <%UvBenServed> psaBig Copyright
[0:11:43] <+worldbrand> What if you just sing loudly along with all of the songs
[0:11:45] <%laserbeaming> understandable
[0:11:46] <yourliteraldog> Necromunda is basically the warriors fighting over drugs and radition with the ocassional eldritch horror
[0:11:46] <heartlesshealer> the music is unfortunately ESSENTIAL to Tony Hawk
[0:11:53] <@SoFarFetched> makes sense
[0:11:53] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Copyright law sucks
[0:11:56] <%za7az> Ah gotcha
[0:11:58] <%OffbeatMinority> Our cat snores loud at times.
[0:11:59] <%laserbeaming> Pyre is great!
[0:11:59] <TheAngryArtist> @patstaresat Do you like FF7?
[0:11:59] <%Albadabar> Tony Hawk with no music is like sex without a sad clown in the corner of the room
[0:12:02] <%TheFabledAble> so like 2 minutes
[0:12:04] <%phantomsleeves> are you gonna play tony hawk on your own
[0:12:06] <Picia000123> I guess Activision wouldn't be bothered to not make it fucky wucky with the license :(

[0:15:08] <Psyramics> I got CK2 for free somehow. I played it for like 4 hours and do not understand a single thing of it
[0:15:10] <%aishman> Wait what game?
[0:15:11] <%TheFabledAble> Pat you fuck dont you dare play bastion, keep talking for forever
[0:15:12] <+Cyborc> it's fucking boring
[0:15:12] <rosemon5001> @BinaryFireball wich is weird because he would totally be into it few years back
[0:15:13] <%toolofparanoia> GW corrected their mistake because the week after they made it Made to Order so everyone that wanted one got one.
[0:15:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> also Mario Battle Royale makes me angry.

[0:15:19] <%M3djedx> psaBougie
[0:15:20] <%phantomsleeves> @blastazoid26 that game gets overwhelming REAL QUICK
[0:15:21] <Snark_Streams> there are people who have played CK2 for YEARS and still don't know how the game works
[0:15:21] <%BinaryFireball> I would guide you
[0:15:23] <%laserbeaming> It's too complex
[0:15:23] <%BinaryFireball> I WOULD
[0:15:24] <%Albadabar> Too much risk of psa1guy
[0:15:24] <+blastazoid26> Like in Total War? LUL
[0:15:26] <%holydeviant1> CK2 has so much DLC man
[0:15:26] <Sp3ctre48> That's a terrible idea
[0:15:28] <%holydeviant1> so much DLC
[0:15:28] <candidateplays> @SubjectX07x No way, it's by far the easiest.
[0:15:28] <%BinaryFireball> I KNOW THE GAME WELL
[0:15:30] <%OffbeatMinority> Hearing his explanation is making me feel intimidated by the game
[0:15:32] <%ha2ken> We won't
[0:15:34] <@SoFarFetched> Remember when people tried to guide him during Total Warhammer LUL
[0:15:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Psyramics they made it F2P a while ago since its got so much DLC
[0:15:35] <$heyitskev_> Let us guide your hips
[0:15:35] <heartlesshealer> we could only give you general objectives, no guiding possible

[0:15:51] <%tinyswampthing> cheer500 I am pleased to announce I am leaving my retail job next week as I im going to start my new job on the 14th. In all honesty I didn't hate it. All the time because I made a lot of friends. Also I learned alot of useful because it was a hardware store. just in time too because no shit they are starting the first wave of Christmas stuff this week
[0:15:53] <+blastazoid26> Dont trust chat, Pat!
[0:15:53] <%laserbeaming> You could get someone who knows what they're doing on a Discord call to hold your hand
[0:15:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> Just do the nudist heresy
[0:15:54] <+TheStarvingGood> I love that game but watching you would give ME anxiety
[0:15:56] <heartlesshealer> oh no
[0:16:03] <yourliteraldog> Its good
[0:16:09] <lionmanguy> Wait, is this like Super Giant bastion, or some other bastion I don't know about?
[0:16:10] <SubjectX07x> @candidateplays I'd argue stellaris is but aight.
[0:16:13] <rosemon5001> you can play the intrique way or just kill and murder everyone @PatStaresAt and anything between

[0:17:10] <SubjectX07x> Helluva boss is better as a single episode pilot, because its plot offers itself better to episodic serialization. @PatStaresAt

[0:29:44] <+Loinclothiclese> @Edgelord_Cthulu dude you have to its the shit imo i dont like transistor but bastion and hades are lit
[0:29:47] <%AncelDeLambert> "he finds an apple. takes a bite. he walk off. left foot right foot left foot right foot"

[0:29:51] <zipfile777> HahaDoge B

[0:30:07] <cephas97> sweet layout!!!
[0:30:07] <%DedlokPM> That is why you play via Mouse and Keyboard. rooSlain

[0:30:28] <Tisaric> SourPls
[0:30:30] <+Loinclothiclese> @Tomschiii yea i did on purpose
[0:30:35] <Tisaric> God I fucking love Darren Korb
[0:30:39] <+Tomschiii> why
[0:30:39] <Snark_Streams> I want this soundtrack injected into my fucking jugular
[0:30:40] <+Edgelord_Cthulu> For me, it was because I got Transistor on my phone and Bastion wasn't available. I got far in it but never did the final boss fight. I may have to go back and play both
[0:30:40] <%Albadabar> God I forgot how much I love everything about this game's presentation
[0:30:44] <%UvBenServed> GUN
[0:30:53] <%honeyman18> is a big hammer the feel good weapon for melee?
[0:30:53] <Blank9> transistor is the customization part of hades for sure
[0:30:59] <%Razputin217> inochiBang
[0:30:59] <+Loinclothiclese> @Tomschiii probably because i didnt like that game either
[0:31:02] <Goodvibes99508> all I can think of when I hear the narrator is the gag in SAO Abridged
[0:31:03] <tkuwari> I forgot how good this soundtrack is
[0:31:05] <@JustinianKnight> the art still holds up very well
[0:31:05] <Tisaric> Still one of my top 5 games just because of how fucking well EVERYTHING is presented
[0:31:12] <shouttothevoid> this was such a strong first game from the studio
[0:31:14] <+Tomschiii> @Loinclothiclese huh? it was by far the best one
[0:31:19] <yourliteraldog> squirt
[0:31:26] <PirateMike_> @PatStaresAt You Pat you gonna play Wasteland 3?
[0:31:29] <+Loinclothiclese> @Tomschiii no it wasnt not even close lol
[0:31:39] <%laserbeaming> I literally forgot about the Repeater
[0:31:44] <+ianabstract> Fall off the edge!
[0:31:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> These little guys are SO FUCKING CUTE woolieSPICE
[0:31:50] <+gitgouda> does it narrate like this the entire game?
[0:31:51] <Tisaric> katana/bow master race
[0:31:53] <+Tomschiii> @Loinclothiclese from music, to choices, to characters and so much more
[0:32:03] <shubachi> who did the narration? was it darren korb?
[0:32:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> @gitgouda yup
[0:32:04] <Tisaric> yes the whole gimmick was the narration
[0:32:05] <@JustinianKnight> And that's the end of his story
[0:32:14] <Tisaric> It wasn't Darren
[0:32:15] <%VashyronM> god, I forgot how pretty this game is
[0:32:18] <+gitgouda> @CappuccinoGuil interesting.
[0:32:19] <%CappuccinoGuil> @shubachi Logan Cunningham
[0:32:23] <Tisaric> His roommater
[0:32:27] <tkuwari> RIP Rondy
[0:32:27] <PirateMike_> Did pat say anything about playing Wasteland 3?
[0:32:35] <shubachi> ahhhh
[0:32:36] <%asgard147> FeelsBadMan
[0:32:42] <+Loinclothiclese> @Tomschiii The gameplay was not interesting to me at all nor was the character design you can say whatever you want but it wasnt the best at all
[0:32:42] <CrimsonFox777> D:
[0:32:47] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> He's dead?
[0:32:49] <+Edgelord_Cthulu> that's a big honkin shield
[0:32:54] <Tisaric> SourPls
[0:33:02] <penitentpentwitch> All hail the parry shield
[0:33:05] <%Kazuhira_Boat> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[0:33:05] <%Albadabar> Music in this game always sorta reminded me of early Diablo 2 for some reason
[0:33:11] <MrMatternot> 100% phys defense
[0:33:18] <+Loinclothiclese> @Tomschiii never discussed it once with a single sg fan i know
[0:33:28] <@JustinianKnight> I can see the diablo 2 comparison
[0:33:32] <@JustinianKnight> same camera
[0:33:35] <Tisaric> God this music never gets old
[0:33:45] <+Tomschiii> @Loinclothiclese did you see the characters? jodi alone beats pretty much everyone alone^^ if one likes VN, one will like pyre
[0:33:47] <+Loinclothiclese> SourPls
[0:33:51] <Tisaric> Supergiant is definitely inspired by Diablo a ton
[0:34:07] <%stabbityrabbit> Yeah, that looks like a lout.
[0:34:08] <%Piemono> Man Bastion feels so slow compared to some of their later games
[0:34:10] <weirdmothgirl> God Supergiant is so consistently great
[0:34:20] <Tisaric> YEYEYEYE BOW
[0:34:27] <%Ipsenscastle> i love the bow line
[0:34:28] <%reonome> SourPls
[0:34:28] <%asgard147> "I HUNGER!" psaPorgmo
[0:34:34] <penitentpentwitch> Release when you flash
[0:34:43] <KaiGoesMoo> Has Supergiant teased at all of what they're working on next?
[0:34:46] <huskarl_zap> PAT
[0:34:49] <huskarl_zap> THATS
[0:34:51] <huskarl_zap> WRONG
[0:34:51] <Tisaric> Hades
[0:34:55] <Tisaric> is what they're working on
[0:34:56] <%SolidusRex> This soundtrack is amazing in general, but this track is fucking great
[0:34:58] <+Loinclothiclese> @Tomschiii did inot just say i didn't care for it? what part of that do you not get lol
[0:35:02] <%Razputin217> sirlioForreal
[0:35:08] <@JustinianKnight> Play nice in chat
[0:35:11] <tkuwari> Aiming is for nerds
[0:35:11] <%AngriestAngryArtist> no Pat is right. why aim when it's not a fucking fps
[0:35:16] <akman14> But Pat, you are a Dork
[0:35:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> why are the autoturrets attacking you
[0:35:23] <valstriam> @piemono definitely lol. Compare this speed to Hades
[0:35:25] <%DedlokPM> @KaiGoesMoo Let them finish Hades before thinking about what is next
[0:35:28] <+Tomschiii> @Loinclothiclese the part where it doesnt matter that you dont care, it is how it is^^
[0:35:31] <%reonome> yeah you're a nerd
[0:35:33] <penitentpentwitch> Parrying bullets sends them back to sender
[0:35:33] <+Loinclothiclese> @LiquidDinosaur cause they angry
[0:35:43] <sophienatorz_unite> i didnt know this game had such a good soundtrack
[0:35:46] <Goodvibes99508> A nerd if you will
[0:36:02] <Tisaric> Like, 50% of the praise was the soundtrack and narration
[0:36:03] <akman14> SourPls
[0:36:05] <+lordericter> yeah your super has consumables
[0:36:08] <yourliteraldog> the stamina tonic
[0:36:12] <penitentpentwitch> One of the best part of Supergiant games: The soundtrack
[0:36:13] <@JustinianKnight> so is Hades like actually done now?
[0:36:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> This was the Darkest Dungeon narrator before Darkest Dungeon
[0:36:19] <1BeatGames> What about geeks?
[0:36:22] <+blastazoid26> Alcohol next to weapons...
[0:36:23] <+Solutha> the gameplay is so quaint after hades
[0:36:24] <Tisaric> Hades isn't on 1.0 yet
[0:36:26] <%SolidusRex> @sophienatorz_unite One of the things this game was so well known for was how good the OST was
[0:36:29] <Tisaric> Launches later this year
[0:36:29] <ShinobiPhoenix> I am a fan of the Breakers Bow
[0:36:33] <+Kenziflyr> It will be soon.
[0:36:34] <filialpails> acoustic frontier trip hop SourPls
[0:36:34] <@JustinianKnight> alright
[0:36:35] <+Tomschiii> hades did not even begin^^
[0:36:46] <$dalmek> I think the narrator has lines for like, every combination of weapons you pick
[0:36:49] <%DedlokPM> @JustinianKnight no but 1.0 release is coming soon
[0:36:52] <$dalmek> which is nuts
[0:36:53] <%stabbityrabbit> It's so weird. I started with Hades and looking at this game is like looking at Hades 1. Despite Hades not technically being the sequel.
[0:36:54] <%Bearjewpiter> arsenal me favorite place SMOrc
[0:36:56] <Tisaric> god I love the "acoustic frontier trip hop" genre description
[0:36:57] <yourliteraldog> I liked the machette and rifle
[0:37:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> @blastazoid26 like God themselves intended
[0:37:07] <$Dakuu75> I thought that menu noise was zangief for a second there
[0:37:11] <@JustinianKnight> Hades seems like very much my jam art style wise but I've just been waiting for full release
[0:37:17] <+YabbaTroll> dark sousl?
[0:37:20] <penitentpentwitch> My favorite build in Bastion was Musket + Bow, as goofy as that be
[0:37:32] <heartlesshealer> yeah, the control icons don't change
[0:37:35] <Tisaric> Katana/Bow was always my go to
[0:37:35] <tkuwari> goblins
[0:37:36] <+Tomschiii> i hope darren and the writing team deliver with hades 1.0. as of now its the weakest in that matter
[0:37:41] <heartlesshealer> this was before that was a thing
[0:37:43] <akman14> 🅱
[0:37:50] <%Ipsenscastle> @stabbityrabbit Supergiant have a particular row they like to hoe. Even Pyre maintains elements of it
[0:37:52] <penitentpentwitch> Fetching
[0:37:54] <penitentpentwitch> Get that loot
[0:37:58] <%machshop> is he a kid or a man
[0:37:59] <+Loinclothiclese> @penitentpentwitch For me id say Hammer musket
[0:38:07] <Tisaric> Are you kidding? The Hades OST is just as good as the rest of his music
[0:38:12] <+Loinclothiclese> @machshop kid
[0:38:18] <+Loinclothiclese> @machshop kid man
[0:38:22] <+Kenziflyr> All of Supergiant's music is fantastic.
[0:38:25] <@JustinianKnight> popcorn stand
[0:38:27] <%Hasmeister96> Has Pat encountered the chinese dude yet?
[0:38:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> okay i fucking love these weird air-poison elemental things and how their nature is never really discussed because they're just there
[0:38:40] <+Loinclothiclese> @Hasmeister96 literally just started man lol
[0:38:42] <+Tomschiii> hades has nothing that is memorable whatsoever, aside from the songs of the couple
[0:38:47] <penitentpentwitch> I liked the reward system where if you get a consumable while full, it gives you EXP instead, rather than waste it
[0:38:55] <ergulor> the chinese duda is way later on
[0:38:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> like we know the Windbag lifecycle but not if they're natural animals, or like, summoned, or artificial
[0:38:58] <+YabbaTroll> SourPls
[0:39:00] <%DedlokPM> @Hasmeister96 Seeing as he is still in the 1st stage/tutorial
[0:39:08] <rafaelba93> hades is so great
[0:39:18] <valstriam> @tomschiii Hard disagree but you seem stubborn with your opinions so whatever
[0:39:20] <%Kazuhira_Boat> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[0:39:20] <@JustinianKnight> this track
[0:39:24] <+Edgelord_Cthulu> oh damn this music
[0:39:24] <%laserbeaming> SourPls
[0:39:28] <+NitronStreams> SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote
[0:39:29] <%ha2ken> The cute art is such a stark contrast to the narration and gameplay. It's weird but I like it.
[0:39:30] <+Loinclothiclese> How are you so wrong lol @Tomschiii
[0:39:32] <Tisaric> SourPls
[0:39:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> such good music
[0:39:43] <%Hasmeister96> @Loinclothiclese OK sorry. Wasn't aware. Was watching an RE7 vod beforehand before I saw he was live, so I didn't know that he only started
[0:39:45] <cache_22> Orb monsters. Pat's rivals.
[0:39:49] <+ConLin_Arts_> monkaS
[0:39:49] <+Tomschiii> @valstriam what can i say, after bangers in their previous titles, hades is such a letdown
[0:39:51] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh yeah this is BIG hades vibes
[0:39:53] <@SoFarFetched> SourPls
[0:40:00] <+ConLin_Arts_> SourPls
[0:40:01] <%GalacticaPhanto> I cant believe I never listened to this soundtrack oh man its dope
[0:40:03] <Valor_13> Music slaps so hard
[0:40:07] <+Tomschiii> @Loinclothiclese says the one who doesnt appreciate good design^^
[0:40:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Hasmeister96 ....Chinese dude? Are the Ura supposed to be asian? i thought they were just like, Ethnically Goth
[0:40:18] <%OffbeatMinority> The voice is deeper than I thought it would be.
[0:40:21] <Tisaric> I don't know how you can play through Hades and not find it literally just as good if not better than everything else Darren's made
[0:40:23] <@JustinianKnight> Transistor prob my fav still but this is real good
[0:40:26] <%ha2ken> Always rob scumbags of their last meals
[0:40:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Hasmeister96 Goths with the genetically innate ability to flash step
[0:40:40] <%Hasmeister96> @Hasmeister96 Sorry, didn't realise. It's been awhile since I played this game
[0:40:49] <%Ipsenscastle> magnet drink = amazingly satisfying
[0:40:51] <Tisaric> SourPls
[0:40:52] <+Edgelord_Cthulu> My voice is probably deeper than you'd expect too
[0:40:53] <mastermidget23> Transistor has my favorite soundtrack, but Hades is probably second.
[0:40:55] <+Loinclothiclese> @Tomschiii holy shit your a joke lol
[0:41:00] <+Tomschiii> @Tisaric have you even listened to the tracks he made in transistor, pyre, bastion?
[0:41:04] <%laserbeaming> the city was dead anyway
[0:41:04] <%za7az> Oops
[0:41:05] <+lordericter> its fiiiiiine
[0:41:10] <Tisaric> Also I adore that every stage has like 5 or 6 music tacks
[0:41:18] <valstriam> @tomschiii Hard disagree yet again. It's the culmination of their polished design and years of experience.
[0:41:19] <%Bearjewpiter> Did I just accidentally a war?
[0:41:23] <%DedlokPM> You didn't the Calamity did
[0:41:25] <Tisaric> @Tomschiii of course I have and Hades is right up there with them
[0:41:28] <%Ipsenscastle> nice job Pat
[0:41:34] <tkuwari> speedrun strats!
[0:41:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> Transistor has the reverse-zandatsu thing where there's lyrics UNTIL you enter Planning Mode and then the lyrics jut become humming
[0:41:50] <Snark_Streams> best song coming up
[0:41:56] <%Hasmeister96> @LiquidDinosaur It's been a while since I played Bastion, so for some reason I remember there being a race in Bastion that are vaguely Chinese/Asian from their clothes
[0:41:58] <penitentpentwitch> Just a little survivor, as a treat
[0:41:59] <akman14> We reach the bastion, game over
[0:42:01] <Tisaric> hard agree best song
[0:42:06] <@BigNaturalMan59> BigNaturalMan59 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months, currently on a 44 month streak! ffxi is the best game ever
[0:42:12] <Tisaric> The main bastion theme is peak OST
[0:42:13] <@JustinianKnight> cog plz
[0:42:13] <cache_22> I just got here a moment ago. Is this Pat's first time playing?
[0:42:15] <%machshop> de plaaaaanet coooooore
[0:42:22] <%SolidusRex> This is the best non-vocal song
[0:42:23] <%crimsonharvest> whats up idiot
[0:42:24] <+Tomschiii> @valstriam doesnt matter in this matter, its only about the ost and how its too tame
[0:42:26] <%DedlokPM> @cache_22 no
[0:42:27] <%Hasmeister96> OK now I see he just started this. Sorry for the confusion
[0:42:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Hasmeister96 okay i dont remember their clothes at all maybe you're right. I just remember them being pale, black haired and flashsteppping
[0:42:31] <valstriam> @tomschiii that's so disingenious. assuming people haven't listened to the previous soundtracks just becuase they said hades ost is great

[0:43:29] <%albret__einstrong> why play bastion when you can play PYRE
[0:43:40] <valstriam> @tomschiii that's just a matter of preference then which is wholly subjective. Please learn to respect the opinion of others.

[0:44:06] <%laserbeaming> Distillery
[0:44:07] <%albret__einstrong> it super doesn't matter
[0:44:08] <+lordericter> you barely have weapons rn

[0:44:13] <valstriam> @loinclothiclese I may have to agree with you lol

[0:44:13] <%aishman> It doesn't
[0:44:16] <%Jaxnos> get drunk first yeehaw
[0:44:16] <penitentpentwitch> Both rewards you with a new item, distillery gives more flexibility early though

[0:44:27] <%Hasmeister96> @LiquidDinosaur OK so I just checked the wiki, and apparently I remember everything wrong, so fuck me I guess. Sorry for all the confusion

[0:44:57] <Tisaric> god the Bastion theme is just peak home base music
[0:45:07] <SABiscotti> Even though I 100% this back on XBLA, it's still Big Vibes
[0:45:16] <+Tomschiii> @valstriam nay, why should i if others wont too :)
[0:45:16] <%Jaxnos> oh no the bow training
[0:45:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> How big was Caelondia supposed to be
[0:45:23] <penitentpentwitch> The real question, do the loot goblins set in and does he invest in the 'God Temple' as soon as it's available?
[0:45:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> was the city this whole area?
[0:45:25] <%Ipsenscastle> The skyway is pretty much totally unexplained haha
[0:45:26] <+Loinclothiclese> Get drunk then snuff some squirts
[0:45:27] <Tisaric> training pog
[0:45:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> or did parts of the city just get blown out as well as up
[0:45:31] <+lordericter> oh boy angles
[0:45:37] <ralphfromdk> This one is not about speed, it's precision
[0:45:44] <+Loinclothiclese> @LiquidDinosaur nah that was like the town center
[0:45:53] <+lordericter> lolp
[0:45:54] <%Ipsenscastle> Nooo bad Pat
[0:45:54] <heartlesshealer> time your shots
[0:45:58] <Daxalog> Best song cooming through
[0:46:04] <%holydeviant1> Power shots, power shots onlt
[0:46:05] <Tisaric> the main bastion area is that level on it's own, but buildings can be made both on the left and right side as you play
[0:46:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Loinclothiclese ok so the fact that every map is so far apart is because of the Calamity
[0:46:08] <Daxalog> coming*
[0:46:11] <%cvp5127> reset
[0:46:13] <%tanarath> Aim
[0:46:20] <%albret__einstrong> you fucke up
[0:46:25] <+ConLin_Arts_> sbfpSetIn
[0:46:27] <valstriam> @tomschiii wow, okay then. I'll stop this conversation since you have no intention to be civil and respect people's opinions.
[0:46:27] <penitentpentwitch> These are challenge rooms, think of them as practice for your abilities more than for their loot. (Though it's good loot)
[0:46:33] <heartlesshealer> items, but no tech
[0:46:34] <%ClericOfSparda> Pat why do you always start your streams whenever I'm about to go into a work meeting?
[0:46:39] <weirdmothgirl> Oh
[0:46:43] <%tanarath> @patstaresat Aim, time your chargeup because power shot pierce.
[0:46:49] <weirdmothgirl> Huh, that seemed really easy to get those 2
[0:46:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Loinclothiclese wait and at the start wouldn't you be at the edge of the city? Kid was in the guild all about reinforcing the perimeter defense
[0:46:55] <%albret__einstrong> you gotta put on the big brain
[0:46:56] <+Loinclothiclese> @LiquidDinosaur yea the calamity fucked everything up in this region
[0:46:57] <+lordericter> if its any consolation your angling was so bad even if you didn't prefect it wouldn't have worked
[0:47:01] <+GrayFox2510> Is Pat gonna go through all Supergiant Games?
[0:47:01] <Tisaric> second place is usually not too hard
[0:47:07] <ralphfromdk> But you need the armory to use em :D
[0:47:08] <Tisaric> the 1st place prizes are the hard ones
[0:47:14] <%Ipsenscastle> Fetching Fizz is what I always used if I remember
[0:47:16] <%NovaKnightmare> Man this is a coolass narrator
[0:47:16] <+Tomschiii> @valstriam you do me, i do you :)
[0:47:17] <%goose_attack_almanac> yes @GrayFox2510
[0:47:17] <+NitronStreams> simple geometry
[0:47:18] <Tisaric> yeah he's doing a Supergiant Marathon
[0:47:19] <$apolitenoob> Man I missed this music
[0:47:20] <heartlesshealer> good luck
[0:47:31] <+GrayFox2510> @goose_attack_almanac Nice, thanks.
[0:47:36] <MEGAangel64> man this game is dope
[0:47:36] <%apostateCourier> game's so gooood
[0:47:36] <%Fooguwu> welcome to the rest of the stream
[0:47:36] <%Ipsenscastle> do it in 4
[0:47:39] <heartlesshealer> try to get 3 per shot
[0:47:39] <+Loinclothiclese> @LiquidDinosaur i believe so its been a bit so where kid starts is a little fuzzy
[0:47:44] <%albret__einstrong> wrong again
[0:47:48] <heartlesshealer> welp
[0:47:51] <+ConLin_Arts_> sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[0:47:52] <penitentpentwitch> You don't need to leave the area to restart, I believe the button in the lower left does it
[0:48:00] <%albret__einstrong> fucked it up on the first shot
[0:48:02] <StaticSunrise> you can do it in 4 shots if you hit 3 at a time
[0:48:11] <%Divryne> Pat doesn't know geometry confirmed.
[0:48:16] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Logan Cunningham is a beast of a voice actor
[0:48:18] <heartlesshealer> help lady
[0:48:21] <%DappercatEsquire> gigabotched
[0:48:21] <+ConLin_Arts_> baby poop?
[0:48:25] <ralphfromdk> Oh no... it's also a puzzle and Pat does not do well at those
[0:48:32] <+ianabstract> zangief leaks
[0:48:39] <+lordericter> oh no more pee
[0:48:41] <+Loinclothiclese> @OverzealousEuthanasiast he really is cant wait to see what else he does
[0:48:43] <valstriam> @tomschiii Funny you said that. I wish you held those views earlier, so you'd respect others and be at least civil with your opinions lol.
[0:48:45] <%SolidusRex> psaDogchamp Feces
[0:48:50] <%laserbeaming> is paper towels a code for something more sinister?
[0:48:59] <Tisaric> I love that Supergiant just full on hired Logan as a full time VA
[0:49:05] <%GalacticaPhanto> this feels like a much comfier stream
[0:49:06] <+OhioNitsud> the hallways are filled with pee
[0:49:16] <weirdmothgirl> @laserbeaming It's code for zangeif having peed
[0:49:23] <Tisaric> like, the team for Supergiant is literally just the original team of Bastion with a couple new additions and it stays that way
[0:49:35] <garrulousAuthority> how farare we into the actual game
[0:49:38] <+ConLin_Arts_> psaDogchamp
[0:49:43] <ArcaneMusic> The strongest and paperist of towels
[0:49:43] <StaticSunrise> zangief piss gremlin
[0:49:50] <penitentpentwitch> Zangief loves to spend Super
[0:49:50] <%laserbeaming> Logan has a really cool voice and a really nice range. He's the voice that talks to you through the book in Pyre
[0:49:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> That's like, 1 of 3 favorite things of dogs
[0:49:53] <%TIME_PUNCHER> did Pat wet himself and blame the dog again?
[0:49:56] <%Xevtes> psaBig psaDogchamp
[0:50:02] <ergulor> You don't
[0:50:06] <ergulor> there is a switch
[0:50:07] <+ConLin_Arts_> Zangief' gentle eyes makes me cry
[0:50:07] <Onamar> No
[0:50:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, you might be able to reset the challenge in the challenge
[0:50:09] <Tisaric> @PatStaresAt the button on the bottom left should let you restart
[0:50:10] <+Tomschiii> @valstriam i respect others, but not their "opinions", which are rather shallow
[0:50:11] <%coreyyotto> there's a reset button in the bottom left
[0:50:14] <penitentpentwitch> You can restart the challenge with the button in the lower left of the arena without leaving
[0:50:14] <+ianabstract> There's a reset switch
[0:50:15] <garrulousAuthority> he's half the goddamn Greek pantheon in Hades
[0:50:15] <%Mr_Pylon> button
[0:50:23] <%DappercatEsquire> you goddamn fool
[0:50:34] <+Loinclothiclese> @garrulousAuthority mans godlike
[0:50:34] <+ianabstract> I like how you stay face down until you press a button
[0:50:44] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Yeah, Logan did a great impression for that Pyre narrator guy
[0:50:46] <+ConLin_Arts_> sbfpSetIn
[0:50:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> @ianabstract relatable
[0:50:50] <%FutaSnek> Holy cow this game came out in 2011. Thats back before everyone hated eachother PogChamp
[0:50:56] <valstriam> @tomschiii Yeah what you just said is ridiculous and not at all respectful of others lol
[0:50:56] <+Loinclothiclese> @ianabstract Right lol like sometimes he just eats it and thinks about it
[0:51:02] <+OhioNitsud> SPD= small pee dog
[0:51:22] <+Tomschiii> @valstriam of others "opinions"
[0:51:24] <+Tomschiii> *
[0:51:35] <dirtyh4rr1> close
[0:51:43] <penitentpentwitch> 1st place usually requires perfection for most of the challenges
[0:51:54] <Tisaric> yeah 1st place is perfection
[0:51:59] <+Loinclothiclese> @OhioNitsud LUL

[0:52:22] <%FutaSnek> LUL
[0:52:33] <%apostateCourier> Pat's played this before, yeah?
[0:52:40] <Tisaric> oh I love this level
[0:52:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> yes at launch
[0:52:43] <valstriam> @tomschiii Yeah you don't seem to understand how ridiculous you sound, so whatever. Downgrading others opinions and marking them as shallow without any basis lol
[0:52:45] <+Loinclothiclese> @critfumble_ what do you mean?
[0:52:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> yea
[0:52:48] <+Loinclothiclese> @apostateCourier yes
[0:52:49] <%laserbeaming> Pat lives there already
[0:52:52] <Tisaric> I think he's played Bastion/Transistor at launch
[0:52:52] <%apostateCourier> thought so
[0:53:00] <%TIME_PUNCHER> People always ask how is Pat, but never WHY is Pat
[0:53:02] <%dasmause> i think this music is called twisted streets
[0:53:02] <penitentpentwitch> That leveling system, you go through more crap and unlock the ability to get drunker
[0:53:08] <%Ipsenscastle> 'only one way to go' = crazy talk
[0:53:13] <+Tomschiii> @valstriam without any basis, huh? ok then
[0:53:14] <Tisaric> He hasn't gone through much of Pyre I think though
[0:53:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> @TIME_PUNCHER What is Pat?
[0:53:32] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> Now here a guy whos just angry and stares at things
[0:53:34] <%TIME_PUNCHER> When is Pat?
[0:53:37] <ralphfromdk> Pat, the shield is basicly Royal Guard. If you can do a perfect parry, it's an instant kill.
[0:53:42] <heartlesshealer> supergiant games always have awesome music
[0:53:43] <%superc37> superc37 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! ey sup pat! glad to see you play one of my favorite games every from my favorite studio! cheers, and cant wait for transistor!
[0:53:46] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> Why is pat
[0:53:49] <critfumble_> @loinclothiclese just wondering how he's feeling about the game, it's one of my favourites but it's also 11 years old and made by 10ish people, it's showing its age a little
[0:53:53] <%FutaSnek> No Scientist can certain pats true nature
[0:54:00] <Tisaric> SourPls
[0:54:01] <+KingDragoonDX> The intersection of bad and wrong: Paige's Streams
[0:54:08] <garrulousAuthority> now go to the other paths for more shit
[0:54:09] <Tisaric> Honestly I don't think it's showing age yet
[0:54:09] <+Loinclothiclese> @critfumble_ its not his first time playing it lol
[0:54:18] <%LegendGHT> is this #sponsored or something?
[0:54:19] <Tisaric> it's still super nice looking and the music keeps it up
[0:54:21] <critfumble_> ah well all good the
[0:54:26] <valstriam> @tomschiii Yep. The discussion earlier was purely subjective so there was obviously no basis for degrading the opinion of others
[0:54:29] <%superc37> god i pove the narrator
[0:54:30] <+Loinclothiclese> @LegendGHT no
[0:54:32] <critfumble_> it's transistor he hasn't played right?
[0:54:33] <+Nintokis> This was such a good game. Had the soundtrack on repeat for a LONG time
[0:54:35] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Bastion Balthazar Bux
[0:54:37] <Tisaric> no he just wanted to go through Supergiant games before Hades @LegendGHT
[0:54:42] <garrulousAuthority> *best weapon*
[0:54:44] <%holydeviant1> I want a plushy squirt

[0:54:48] <+Tomschiii> @valstriam then go back to the beginning
[0:54:51] <Tisaric> @critfumble_ I think he's said he went through it, but not Pyre
[0:54:52] <s_snowball> best non-vocalized song in the game
[0:54:56] <%laserbeaming> hold to throw
[0:55:00] <critfumble_> aaah okay

[0:56:46] <%ClericOfSparda> "Scumbag" is old slang for an old used/full condom.
[0:56:48] <+Loinclothiclese> yea you fucking goober
[0:56:49] <%Hasmeister96> Pat go back to where you got the machete
[0:56:50] <Onamar> YES
[0:56:50] <penitentpentwitch> When a game is so enthralling, Pat doesn't see chat flipping out
[0:56:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> oh no he has ipods in he cant see the chat
[0:56:58] <MrMatternot> Nice
[0:57:05] <%holydeviant1> pet squirt <3
[0:57:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> yeah wait so if you miss a colletble is it lost?
[0:57:15] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Rambunctious heh
[0:57:15] <akman14> Books tend to exist,yes
[0:57:17] <%TIME_PUNCHER> You'll have to speak up, he's not wearing pants
[0:57:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> I recall you cant go back to zones
[0:57:21] <%MassConnect> One Guide
[0:57:24] <%Ipsenscastle> Pat is a corn bin
[0:57:25] <%FutaSnek> Pat Squirts at?\
[0:57:25] <+Nintokis> Bastion just has a way of captivating for that first playthrough
[0:57:31] <%FutaSnek> Never mind I dont like that
[0:57:34] <%hermitsen> hermitsen subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! Can't wait for nintendo to show how generous they are by extending extending the availability of the mario collection by 2 weeks
[0:57:34] <heartlesshealer> sure, Jan
[0:57:36] <penitentpentwitch> @LiquidDinosaur There's a building later that lets you buy items you missed
[0:57:40] <%CappuccinoGuil> Chat NEVER helps
[0:57:48] <$Vineslop_Tod> psaBlind
[0:57:53] <+Pyroclase> Geez Chat, I can't believe you didn't help Pat find that scroll
[0:57:55] <%DedlokPM> psa2guy
[0:58:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> EAST SYYYYEEEEED
[0:58:16] <Tisaric> @penitentpentwitch oh shit I didn't realize that it added stuff you missed that's super smart
[0:58:21] <%LegendGHT> Bastion was cool but I think I liked Transistor more
[0:58:30] <garrulousAuthority> *poison*
[0:58:32] <%superc37> god i love this games art
[0:58:33] <%Hasmeister96> OK so I checked and apparently a Machete is a spanish sword
[0:58:45] <Tisaric> Bastion is only ever so slightly above Transistor for me
[0:58:46] <heartlesshealer> upgrade branches are a staple of Supergiant games
[0:58:47] <tkuwari> Crit chance?
[0:58:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> Chat, can you get all upgrades or is it just 1 per row?
[0:58:53] <+Kenziflyr> Is Pat going through all the Supergiant games?
[0:58:54] <Tisaric> you can swap
[0:58:57] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> I think bastion is my favorite of their games
[0:58:57] <penitentpentwitch> @Tisaric It's more efficient to find them, but it's a nice safety net
[0:58:58] <garrulousAuthority> 1 per row
[0:58:59] <Tisaric> you get one per row
[0:59:03] <ergulor> 1 per row
[0:59:03] <%A0N33> I think you can freely swap between them?
[0:59:05] <garrulousAuthority> but free swap between them
[0:59:05] <%LegendGHT> Machete is Spy Kid's uncle
[0:59:08] <+lordericter> crit is good for swinging serration for throw build
[0:59:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> DOTs because FUCK chance
[0:59:10] <ralphfromdk> Go with your old mantra. Big number over % chance
[0:59:11] <%GarbageNirvana> I like a good DoT myself
[0:59:13] <Tisaric> 1 per row but free swaps yeah
[0:59:14] <@StridentSong> You can swap between the two once you buy one tier.
[0:59:15] <+Kenziflyr> When you buy the row, you can choose between the two
[0:59:16] <StaticSunrise> GOB LINS GOB LINS GOB LINS
[0:59:18] <ergulor> yes you can
[0:59:19] <+crash400> I JUST got here! did pat check out the Nintendo Direct
[0:59:19] <%Ipsenscastle> draw speed is much less situational
[0:59:21] <%tanarath> You can change your choices, Pat
[0:59:21] <%DedlokPM> you can swap at any time
[0:59:34] <VoiceActingNinja> 21 raiders from VoiceActingNinja have joined! 
[0:59:37] <penitentpentwitch> There was a lot of QoL in this game
[0:59:39] <%tanarath> Yes
[0:59:51] <%superc37> FUUUUUCK i love this narration
[0:59:53] <%tanarath> It is great
[0:59:53] <Rozalyndis> he gud boi
[0:59:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Hasmeister96 makes sense, if you're conquering a jungle continent you want to have a good small sword for fucking up vines
[1:00:03] <Tisaric> yeah that's my favorite part about Supergiant - they know how to do QoL and polish SO WELL
[1:00:07] <garrulousAuthority> god this system has come so far from Bastion to Hades
[1:00:13] <%asgard147> Good boy limesAw psaDogchamp
[1:00:26] <%ClericOfSparda> Yooooo
[1:00:33] <heartlesshealer> drink
[1:00:36] <+typo114> VoHiYo VoHiYo VoHiYo
[1:00:44] <ArcaneMusic> psaCaw
[1:00:45] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> It will be pat
[1:00:46] <heartlesshealer> it depends on how you play
[1:00:47] <%laserbeaming> And Pat doesn't even acknowledge the Raid LUL
[1:00:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> best weapon is the hunting rifle
[1:01:00] <TioXyco> ah, I see you fixed your AC again
[1:01:01] <aeonicvector> Machete is easily the best dps weapon
[1:01:05] <Tisaric> SourPls
[1:01:06] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> SQUIRT Pog
[1:01:10] <penitentpentwitch> Each weapon caters to a style of play, the combos really help cover
[1:01:10] <butthurtdave> Wait, Bastion? This stream kinda took me by surprise but i'm up for it
[1:01:11] <%Hasmeister96> @LiquidDinosaur Good point. Didn't realise that
[1:01:14] <Butt_on_Masher> machete and corssbow with auto aim are the best combo
[1:01:15] <+typo114> Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:01:15] <Tisaric> I'm going to SourPls every single time we come back here
[1:01:20] <garrulousAuthority> Alright chat what's your Bastion loadout
[1:01:21] <%TheFabledAble> spear is a lotta fun too
[1:01:23] <Tisaric> I fucking love this song so much
[1:01:29] <%tanarath> Friend
[1:01:30] <penitentpentwitch> *weakness so you can use most any combination
[1:01:32] <%Bearjewpiter> brownRAYD
[1:01:36] <VoiceActingNinja> happy to help! Bastion's a great game and so are you
[1:01:49] <%Hasmeister96> @butthurtdave He talked about it on this week's podcast
[1:01:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> @garrulousAuthority the mortar and cannon that makes Rucks say "okay you're just being silly now"
[1:01:56] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> Pat remember you can toss the machete
[1:01:57] <penitentpentwitch> Dancing shot is nice for AoE
[1:02:00] <%Ipsenscastle> Pat IS a great game, this is true
[1:02:07] <Tisaric> YUP
[1:02:09] <nansex> you don't have to acknowledge 20 viewer raids as a streamer that can get thousands of viewers...
[1:02:11] <tkuwari> that's really in depth
[1:02:19] <garrulousAuthority> "I mean come on! That's just overkill!"
[1:02:20] <+Pyroclase> Oh, so like how you had to use perk combos to unlock character bios in transistor
[1:02:23] <BoSteed> Dialogue for EVERYTHING
[1:02:23] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, full of dialogue <3
[1:02:25] <ergulor> melt
[1:02:25] <%tanarath> Yep
[1:02:26] <filialpails> combinatoric explosion
[1:02:30] <heartlesshealer> melting pot or Peach
[1:02:31] <+Kenziflyr> Melting
[1:02:31] <%FutaSnek> IM FUCKIN INVINCABLE
[1:02:33] <%Ipsenscastle> Sundowning seems appropriate
[1:02:36] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Pyre
[1:02:38] <penitentpentwitch> Go full Paige, sundown!
[1:02:38] <%ClericOfSparda> SUN DOWNING
[1:02:39] <%laserbeaming> walk the sundown path
[1:02:41] <%mythcreant> m e l t
[1:02:42] <StaticSunrise> sundowning = paige melting pot = patsweaty
[1:02:45] <%Divryne> Melting into Peach.
[1:02:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Does paige live on sundown
[1:02:45] <StaticSunrise> s ronis
[1:02:47] <%Bailey__gaming> Sundowning for sure
[1:02:55] <%FutaSnek> LUL
[1:02:58] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Pyre has a last song that changes lyrics depending on your choices too
[1:02:58] <tkuwari> the cuh-lah-meti, this guy's voice is so satisfying
[1:03:04] <%TheFabledAble> sundowning
[1:03:04] <garrulousAuthority> WHO'S TALKING
[1:03:14] <+Tomschiii> max payne and the narrator...still one of the sexiest voices out there
[1:03:15] <+PaladinGreenjay> has pat played this before? I always kinda assumed he did
[1:03:21] <%Dingalow> Dingalow subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Pat, what is the worst thing you've ever done on stream?
[1:03:27] <+Kenziflyr> He did on release.
[1:03:29] <+Loinclothiclese> @PaladinGreenjay yes
[1:03:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> @tkuwari Logan Cunningham is good

[1:04:52] <+Loinclothiclese> @Bailey__gaming wait what, it did?
[1:04:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> #NotAllSquirts
[1:05:03] <garrulousAuthority> high enough stacks of poison can kill most enemies before they even spawn in
[1:05:06] <Tisaric> yeah it's the best
[1:05:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> Man, that DOT just melts enemy
[1:05:08] <+Loinclothiclese> @Bailey__gaming like full release or EA?
[1:05:11] <heartlesshealer> DoTs forever <3
[1:05:18] <Zetheos> I only recently played through this game and it was just as excellent as I had been told
[1:05:18] <TioXyco> @LiquidDinosaur some gush
[1:05:22] <Tisaric> Katana/bow was my favorite combo easy
[1:05:39] <Momofukku> Guys should I buy Avengers? Is it gonna be bad?
[1:05:40] <butthurtdave> Hey Pat, any interest in doing anything with Spiritfarer or Wasteland 3?
[1:05:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> No Friendly Fire, awesome
[1:05:44] <garrulousAuthority> yes
[1:05:45] <Tisaric> yes
[1:05:45] <+Loinclothiclese> @Bailey__gaming oh shit yea realms deep starts today
[1:05:46] <ergulor> Yes
[1:05:47] <garrulousAuthority> Machete
[1:05:52] <StaticSunrise> avengers will be bad
[1:05:57] <%Hasmeister96> We mean the machete
[1:06:03] <%LegendGHT> I forgot how much the narrator just GOES
[1:06:04] <PanicSwytch> Kay tana
[1:06:05] <1matheuw> keytenna
[1:06:06] <BoSteed> Uchi
[1:06:08] <%Ipsenscastle> Kaytoooonaaaaa
[1:06:08] <garrulousAuthority> Machete + any of the ranged weapons is a good bet
[1:06:09] <Torgue_1> Does the bit work if you already pronunced it correctly?
[1:06:16] <butthurtdave> @Momofukku dont get it at launch, wait until they iron the bugs out and patch it and the price drop happens
[1:06:16] <%Dingalow> Kartarnar
[1:06:24] <%Bearjewpiter> Haven't played Bastion in a long while, are there enemies weak to certain weapons?
[1:06:25] <Zetheos> kaytaynay
[1:06:43] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> SourPls
[1:06:43] <1matheuw> oh shit this kinda slaps
[1:06:45] <%Hasmeister96> @Torgue_1 What actually caused the bit to begin with
[1:06:47] <ProtoShawk> SourPls
[1:06:48] <SainEdge> most viewers are weebs, they call every blade weapon a katana Kappa
[1:06:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> THIS SONG
[1:06:52] <chambatron> When does hades release on console?
[1:06:52] <+Arkfyre> SourPls
[1:06:52] <Zetheos> for hot
[1:06:53] <heartlesshealer> corn bin
[1:06:53] <%BinaryFireball> I forgot how strongly my mixed feelings are for the narrator
[1:06:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> what instrument is that
[1:06:57] <%superc37> GOD I FUCKING LOVE THIS GAME
[1:06:58] <Zetheos> ... fire hot
[1:06:58] <Tisaric> I don't think any enemy is weak to a specific weapon but they can be dealt with better with different ones
[1:07:01] <smuggleruncle> kitana
[1:07:01] <garrulousAuthority> @Bearjewpiter not strictly weak, but certain enemies you want piercing or DoT on since they have shielding
[1:07:03] <%Spydurman> dat music
[1:07:03] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[1:07:04] <+Kenziflyr> I don't think weapons do anymore damage based on the enemy, but of course there are some weapons better for certain monsters
[1:07:08] <%Razputin217> quiettMusic
[1:07:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> @BinaryFireball what a mixture of Good and Really Good?
[1:07:16] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> Best supergiant game
[1:07:20] <%asgard147> limesLUL
[1:07:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> @BinaryFireball or do you mean for him as a character in the story
[1:07:26] <garrulousAuthority> this whole soundtrack *slaps*
[1:07:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> @BinaryFireball because yes Rucks is a complex man
[1:07:35] <+PaladinGreenjay> This narration has similar vibes to Darkest Dungeon, both among my favorites
[1:07:39] <%LegendGHT> this music is still great
[1:07:47] <akman14> No taxes PogChamp
[1:07:55] <TioXyco> D;

[1:08:02] <%Buzzard42> Buzzard42 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:08:04] <%BinaryFireball> @LiquidDinosaur I mean he narrates everything every two seconds and even though I like his voice It's a bit much for me
[1:08:10] <Tisaric> I'm honestly surprised people are just now learning that this game has an amazing OST
[1:08:12] <butthurtdave> Pat, any plans for Spiritfarer or Wasteland 3?
[1:08:17] <+Loinclothiclese> REALMS DEEP SALE ON STEAM RIGHT NOW
[1:08:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> @BinaryFireball i mean the whole game is literally just him talking about the events leading up to the final level
[1:08:35] <%Kyoshikei> SourPls

[1:08:45] <Tisaric> SourPls btw

[1:08:51] <%ha2ken> This worldbuilding
[1:08:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> @PaladinGreenjay I cant get into Darkest Dungeon because i can do a roguelike where if ou lose you start over, but a game where if you lose you can keep going but are kneecapped, anh
[1:08:54] <penitentpentwitch> Damage, the most powerful of shots!
[1:09:03] <%SirGO0SE> how you enjoying it so far? sup gang
[1:09:03] <a_mad_dragon> M O R E D O T S
[1:09:07] <%BinaryFireball> @LiquidDinosaur well damn
[1:09:14] <garrulousAuthority> remember Pat, squirts *hate* getting stabbed
[1:09:16] <heartlesshealer> need materials for machete
[1:09:16] <+oedocontroller> damn, this game fills me with nostalgia. It's super old
[1:09:22] <+Loinclothiclese> @SirGO0SE hes played it before
[1:09:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> @PaladinGreenjay but man i'd like an easy baby mode of Darkest Dungeon thats for people who will never claim to legitimately beat it, but i just want to hear Wayne June talk
[1:09:26] <Tisaric> YEYEYE
[1:09:32] <rafaelba93> hammer is also great
[1:09:35] <penitentpentwitch> Machete challenge is go
[1:09:41] <+Pyroclase> ... squirt extract
[1:09:41] <%Hasmeister96> @Torgue_1 OK I see. Thanks. I thought it originally had to do with the anime 'My Love Story'
[1:09:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> 18 NAKED WINDBAGS AT WNGBAG RANCH
[1:09:55] <Tisaric> this challenge was always the hardest to get for me
[1:09:57] <Maniamax> Someone get me some squirt extract
[1:09:58] <+discognition> these challenges are hard, but worth getting max rewards as soon as you can
[1:10:02] <SirKeigan> What's a Bastion?
[1:10:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> @LiquidDinosaur easy mode in that game is playing with the wiki page LUL
[1:10:11] <+lordericter> the spawners are an issue
[1:10:20] <+Edgelord_Cthulu> I was gone for maybe 15 minutes and everything apparently went to hell lmao
[1:10:22] <+Pyroclase> This game's color pallete is fantastic.
[1:10:24] <Zetheos> "friends"
[1:10:24] <+discognition> use trip mines for the spawners
[1:10:25] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Once I got hammer, never turned back, unless to smash something behind me with the hammer
[1:10:27] <%SirGO0SE> @Loinclothiclese oooooo
[1:10:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> @SirKeigan is that a for real question or a bit?
[1:10:32] <garrulousAuthority> @LiquidDinosaur WINDBAG RANCH REALLY ROCKS
[1:10:41] <penitentpentwitch> On the bright side, 3rd place is usually an upgrade item for the challenge you've done
[1:11:00] <penitentpentwitch> Gravity 2, Pat 0
[1:11:02] <+PaladinGreenjay> @LiquidDinosaur I can totally get that, though the tools it gives you to not make a run unwinnable/total misery are pretty alright IMO
[1:11:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CappuccinoGuil like if i could savescum but every frame of the game is just watermarked with "SCRUB" so i cant post screenshots claiming im good, i'd be fijne
[1:11:11] <gamesdonedrunk_> How much have I missed?
[1:11:18] <%tanarath> upgrades, pat
[1:11:20] <Tisaric> SourPls
[1:11:22] <heartlesshealer> enjoy
[1:11:22] <+RealPT1> there's a spread shot upgrade that helps alot for this one
[1:11:22] <+PaladinGreenjay> but yes, wayne june is the best
[1:11:23] <+Monkeydude07> atpTryAiming
[1:11:27] <+discognition> only throw for turrets
[1:11:28] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> He HATES it
[1:11:30] <Tisaric> yeah this one really needs some upgrades
[1:11:34] <+ianabstract> without upgrades this one's basically impossible
[1:11:38] <StaticSunrise> Why does Pat bad?
[1:11:39] <waltzqueen> Bastion's OST is godlike
[1:11:40] <%tanarath> You haven't refolded your kaytawna yet
[1:11:43] <gamezerox> aiming is for the weak
[1:11:43] <+Loinclothiclese> @gamesdonedrunk_ a fair amount
[1:11:48] <Zetheos> that little guy just laughing at him
[1:11:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> @LiquidDinosaur accurate. The lowest difficult is pretty alright and if you play super safe, it can be a breeze, but even THEN you need to really know what you're doing.
[1:11:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @StaticSunrise this is basically the hardest challenge
[1:11:51] <heartlesshealer> 1
[1:11:58] <penitentpentwitch> 3rd place is REAL generous
[1:12:05] <ergulor> Yeah this one is hard
[1:12:09] <Tisaric> That's pretty much the hardest challenge in the game
[1:12:09] <heartlesshealer> stinky
[1:12:11] <1matheuw> thats creepy
[1:12:13] <+Edgelord_Cthulu> oh nvm everything's fine
[1:12:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CappuccinoGuil what like, know which random events to do and not do because it might be too likely tof uck up to be worth it?
[1:12:14] <%Razputin217> You Tried
[1:12:14] <Parapattern> Stinky boy
[1:12:15] <+discognition> trip mines for spawners
[1:12:16] <Tisaric> maybe the shield one can be weird
[1:12:18] <garrulousAuthority> more blades
[1:12:22] <garrulousAuthority> yeeee
[1:12:24] <GammaCharged> these challenges can be rea rough without all the upgrades
[1:12:26] <%CzeekyPlays> "That kid smells good and ripe" monkaS
[1:12:33] <penitentpentwitch> Gravity 3, Pat 0
[1:12:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CappuccinoGuil like how say, in FTL if you see the space station with giant spiders there is NEVER a good outcome for exploring it?
[1:12:47] <Parapattern> "SNOOOOF"
[1:12:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> LEWD
[1:12:49] <%SirGO0SE> rooGasm
[1:12:55] <Bigyanno> this narrator is fine and all but he doesn't have the same punch as the hades one
[1:13:01] <penitentpentwitch> Rush the spawners as soon as possible
[1:13:01] <heartlesshealer> remember corn bins
[1:13:04] <%Hasmeister96> @penitentpentwitch Meanwhile Matt sits in ice cream again
[1:13:04] <Tisaric> Pat please
[1:13:05] <%king_wragles> They stopped saying it cause it was gross...
[1:13:12] <+Erimos> Kreygasm
[1:13:12] <Tisaric> I mean, this is the first game

[1:13:18] <Tisaric> Hades is their 4th
[1:13:20] <%UvBenServed> Kreygasm
[1:13:21] <Zetheos> kill spawners first mate
[1:13:39] <+PaladinGreenjay> haruka8Happy
[1:13:42] <+Link232> You don't kill the spawners first, you kill all the spawning green ones before they spread everywhere
[1:13:42] <%CappuccinoGuil> @LiquidDinosaur something like that. For example, if you know what a boss is all about, you can build a party that can melt them, but that requires you having that knowledge first.
[1:13:49] <%Ipsenscastle> ive still never seen a game do the narration gimmick nearly as well as bastion
[1:14:04] <heartlesshealer> they're weak enough that you don't need to wait for power shot I think?
[1:14:18] <%Buzzard42> EZ Clap
[1:14:24] <Tisaric> this is definitely the hardes to get 1st in
[1:14:27] <ergulor> Wait for more upgrades
[1:14:29] <+Loinclothiclese> @Ipsenscastle only thing not super giant id say is darkest dungeon
[1:14:33] <Tisaric> you really want al lthe upgrades for this one
[1:14:35] <Onamar> Blender all the green ones while they spawn in
[1:14:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CappuccinoGuil what if you just go in without a torch, and go till you get ONE treasure and leave
[1:14:38] <snakemuho> just gitgud
[1:14:40] <+rednecked__crake> First time Bastion? PogChamp
[1:14:41] <penitentpentwitch> This is one of the tougher challenges, you can come back later with more upgrades
[1:14:44] <+discognition> run into middle spawn point asap, swing wildly
[1:15:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CappuccinoGuil wait fuck that wont work because everyone is always gradually becoming more mentally ill. I guess if you did it with just disposable people but ehhh
[1:15:05] <%Ipsenscastle> @Loinclothiclese that's the closest for sure, but even there it's not nearly as tailored
[1:15:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CappuccinoGuil is there any way to like, "grind?"
[1:15:17] <%tanarath> Gotta refold that kaytawna over 10,000 times, Pat.
[1:15:26] <garrulousAuthority> Antiquarian runs to grind out gold
[1:15:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CappuccinoGuil like lets say i have some garbage recruits i dont care about, is there a way to some missions reliably enough that i come out with a profit
[1:15:33] <Tisaric> I mean pretty much every Supergiant game does a variation on the narrator
[1:15:35] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> POGGERS
[1:15:35] <1matheuw> god
[1:15:35] <heartlesshealer> Good job!
[1:15:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> okay yeah that
[1:15:36] <penitentpentwitch> Victory
[1:15:41] <Tisaric> Hell yeah pat
[1:15:43] <+Erimos> Wow, well done.
[1:15:45] <+ianabstract> yeah I remember this one took me a while
[1:15:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> antiquarians suck at everything but gridning right?
[1:15:46] <Bigyanno> Pro strats
[1:15:47] <+LandOfTheWay> PogChamp
[1:15:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> like they're only really for loot?
[1:15:52] <%DedlokPM> psaDogchamp mogsPOG rooPog
[1:15:54] <penitentpentwitch> It's mostly RNG on their pathing for the ones that wander off
[1:15:56] <garrulousAuthority> yes that's correct
[1:15:57] <%asgard147> limesPoggers
[1:15:58] <%tanarath> Nice job
[1:15:58] <Bigyanno> The penis is large today huh?
[1:15:59] <+rednecked__crake> The god PogChamp
[1:16:00] <Parapattern> Squart
[1:16:02] <+Link232> Personal opinion is hardest one without upgrades is the shingle
[1:16:06] <+oedocontroller> admittedly, you did cheat the game by ganking the middle :v
[1:16:09] <garrulousAuthority> they give you extra inventory space for gold stacks
[1:16:20] <heartlesshealer> you got a material for another new weapon
[1:16:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> and the first knight you get is ALWAYS a thief right?
[1:16:27] <%CappuccinoGuil> @LiquidDinosaur yes, in fact you might need to do specific grinding/farming runs. However, high level characters will refuse to go on low level runs.
[1:16:31] <heartlesshealer> just in time for Sundown
[1:16:32] <Zetheos> I'm doing alright thanks
[1:16:37] <garrulousAuthority> Dismas and Reynaud
[1:16:39] <1matheuw> hi doggo
[1:16:41] <%Ipsenscastle> squeeze the dog out
[1:16:42] <garrulousAuthority> Crusader and Highwayman
[1:16:44] <Tisaric> God I adore this game so much
[1:16:45] <%arancet> squeeze dog until all pee is out
[1:16:47] <%DedlokPM> @LiquidDinosaur upgrade mats, which are one of the most important things in the game as you need them to make the weapons better
[1:16:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CappuccinoGuil okay THAT is bullshit
[1:16:59] <ArcaneMusic> psaCaw Did you know? Dog's gotta take a piss
[1:17:02] <Tisaric> SourPls
[1:17:03] <%Dingalow> Dog don't care
[1:17:14] <%DappercatEsquire> pat walks the sundown path every stream
[1:17:22] <filialpails> now that paige is here we can do this level
[1:17:29] <heartlesshealer> yeah this is the run one <3
[1:17:29] <Tisaric> I've probably listened to this soundtrack upwards of hundreds of times and it never gets old
[1:17:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> Anime is a path i walk alone
[1:17:38] <garrulousAuthority> hey it's Fall Guys
[1:17:43] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> SourPls
[1:17:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> @LiquidDinosaur nah, in fact it's helpful. It makes you level up lots of characters so you don't get too badly hurt when your top tier heroes die, since you'll have 7 other high levels
[1:17:51] <Tisaric> SourPls
[1:18:19] <penitentpentwitch> Loot magnet is good on these levels~
[1:18:24] <+Pyroclase> ooooh, the music
[1:18:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CappuccinoGuil wish i could kill the groundskeeper he just keeps wasting my perfectly good brothel and church
[1:18:57] <1matheuw> bark bark
[1:18:58] <%Hasmeister96> DOG!!!
[1:19:01] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> DOG BARK PogChamp
[1:19:02] <+Pyroclase> he bork, because he is dog
[1:19:18] <+rednecked__crake> catJAM
[1:19:18] <garrulousAuthority> so back when this was a functioning society, did people just get used to being yeeted from place to place
[1:19:25] <penitentpentwitch> I look forward to the podcast segment for this game
[1:19:26] <%SwdVengeance> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[1:19:28] <Tisaric> God, we've heard 3 different songs alone in this level and I fucking love it
[1:19:30] <%asgard147> "ARE YOU STEALING MY FOOD AGAIN?!" psaDogchamp
[1:19:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> @LiquidDinosaur once you level those up, even the 1st level of stress treatment is pretty useful, so it balances itself out. DD is STILL a very hard and long game, though. Much better than it used to be
[1:20:03] <+LandOfTheWay> UH OH, BIG
[1:20:22] <heartlesshealer> just stand in poison
[1:20:26] <%Bearjewpiter> psaBig scumbag
[1:20:31] <%Ipsenscastle> missed health
[1:21:24] <Tisaric> oh hey make that 4 songs
[1:21:27] <%arcielardor> genius kojumbo
[1:21:28] <%Hasmeister96> Think that might be for the fang repeater
[1:22:02] <1matheuw> zangief is thiccc
[1:22:04] <cephas97> link
[1:22:16] <Tisaric> I love the rhythm of this game - it's fast paced but still lengthy enough to be satisfying
[1:22:21] <%asgard147> "No." psaDogchamp
[1:22:22] <heartlesshealer> "something nasty" is for the repeater
[1:22:48] <%arcielardor> or for Paige to eat
[1:22:57] <+oedocontroller> you should start caring for all of those things
[1:23:03] <Tisaric> SourPls
[1:23:10] <penitentpentwitch> Gravity 4, Pat 0
[1:23:19] <heartlesshealer> Pat knows the song
[1:23:20] <%maskofmichael> I'm late what is this game?
[1:23:27] <%Ipsenscastle> 'ill dig my hole, you build a wall...'
[1:23:31] <+lordericter> time for the race
[1:23:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> one day that wall is gonna fall...
[1:23:34] <+Kenziflyr> build a wall!
[1:23:35] <+cluckme_arse> lord of the rings
[1:23:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> Wait, so.......even before the gcalamity this was in the air?
[1:23:39] <%superc37> "i dig my hole you build a wall.."
[1:23:42] <%DappercatEsquire> @maskofmichael Bastion
[1:23:43] <%Hasmeister96> @heartlesshealer OK I see. Thanks. TBH I think there might be another gun, so that's maybe what something burnt is for
[1:23:43] <%Buzzard42> @maskofmichael look at the stream title
[1:23:43] <garrulousAuthority> leave that song for later y'all
[1:23:45] <%Agami23> man, i listened to this games soundtrack ALOT during highschool
[1:23:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> was there always floating shit in this world or is it all just the Calamity
[1:24:06] <%Hasmeister96> @maskofmichael Bastion. Pat is doing a Supergiant games marathon
[1:24:13] <%superc37> ... yes?
[1:24:13] <%maskofmichael> @DappercatEsquire I mean what it's about?
[1:24:15] <waltzqueen> "build a wall" is so fucking good
[1:24:21] <%Ipsenscastle> oh i forgot about this one
[1:24:22] <Tisaric> I believe everything wasn't floating
[1:24:24] <heartlesshealer> @Hasmeister96 Yeah, I forget all the weapons, so there's probably a gun-gun as opposed to the repeating crossbow Pat has right now
[1:24:29] <%Buzzard42> F
[1:24:30] <%Ipsenscastle> took me a few tries i seem to remember
[1:24:32] <%Hasmeister96> @LiquidDinosaur Think it might just be the calamity
[1:24:33] <penitentpentwitch> Gravity 5, Pat 0
[1:24:33] <Onamar> greed
[1:24:36] <+Pyroclase> oh man, it's the pit from Control all over again
[1:24:37] <%mythcreant> gravity always wins
[1:24:37] <Tisaric> the cog on the back of the kid is what is bringing the floor back up in the air
[1:24:39] <penitentpentwitch> Great first run though
[1:24:45] <garrulousAuthority> @LiquidDinosaur not everything was floating, but stuff was, and then the Calamity elevated *everything*
[1:24:46] <%DappercatEsquire> @maskofmichael Isometric action game with some very light RPG-ish elements, takes place after world asplode
[1:24:51] <%Razputin217> Greed
[1:24:51] <KaliasTV> I remember this mission being hell on a mouse
[1:25:09] <Parapattern> Something greasy, like Pat
[1:25:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> @garrulousAuthority what about all the sutff in the background? there's still like, stuff down there
[1:25:11] <%maskofmichael> @maskofmichael Thank you
[1:25:36] <garrulousAuthority> there were places the Calamity didn't target
[1:25:37] <%superc37> wait did you just @ yourself
[1:25:44] <garrulousAuthority> as much
[1:25:44] <%Hasmeister96> @heartlesshealer Honestly, this is jogging my memory, so I think it might be a musket
[1:25:49] <+lordericter> lmao
[1:25:57] <heartlesshealer> might be musket, yeah
[1:25:57] <$apolitenoob> lol
[1:26:14] <%tanarath> yep
[1:26:25] <garrulousAuthority> Something Burnt is for the Mortar

[1:30:37] <garrulousAuthority> remember that line chat

[1:31:09] <garrulousAuthority> @Daxalog from what we've seen of it, the Calamity was literally just a nuke

[1:34:37] <Daxalog> So did everyone else roll Machete / Rapid for most of the game?
[1:34:39] <BoneofMalkav> Bastion makes Bastion with his Bastion while he takes Bastion to Bastion

[1:34:49] <heartlesshealer> oh pyth

[1:35:27] <heartlesshealer> plush pyth
[1:35:30] <%Hasmeister96> @LiquidDinosaur You mean the Needler from Halo?
[1:35:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> God's not here, Pooh, only me.
[1:35:35] <+LandOfTheWay> Gods Will Not Help You, Only Trust Your Fists
[1:35:35] <Tisaric> you'll be sorry for what you've done
[1:35:36] <filialpails> big brain!

[1:35:55] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> HEAVENLY BULL ANGRY
[1:36:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> Uhhh is that heresy
[1:36:08] <+Erimos> ROYAL GUARD
[1:36:09] <garrulousAuthority> someone call Ishtar
[1:36:11] <%SolidusRex> No gods or kings, only Elmo
[1:36:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> or is riding the mechanical bull actually like a form of worship
[1:36:12] <+oedocontroller> this is where hammer could've been useful
[1:36:14] <%Hasmeister96> @garrulousAuthority OK for some reason I thought it would increase the throw damage with the bow
[1:36:17] <penitentpentwitch> Loot goblins go!
[1:36:26] <+Pyroclase> This game's art style is so unique, there's elements from all over the place.
[1:36:26] <Tisaric> God I love that you can see literally every mechanic that Supergiant LOVES in this game still
[1:36:32] <heartlesshealer> Hi challenge skulls
[1:36:37] <%CappuccinoGuil> Look, HADES LUL
[1:36:39] <%Ipsenscastle> all supergiant games have this, it's your risk/reward difficulty modifier
[1:36:40] <+RealPT1> challenge modifiers
[1:36:43] <Parapattern> Attack and Dethrone the Gods
[1:36:43] <Daxalog> You get a shrine back at the base
[1:36:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> @oedocontroller i hope Pat brings armor pierce to act 2 or he's gonna have a bad time
[1:36:44] <%Hasmeister96> @LiquidDinosaur That's great
[1:36:44] <%Ipsenscastle> like the pact of punishment
[1:36:48] <+Erimos> Ah yes, the patented Supergiant difficulty modifier system.
[1:36:49] <+Arkfyre> SourPls
[1:36:52] <garrulousAuthority> so much of this game just got carried through for the next decade
[1:36:53] <gamezerox> This is the difficulty slider
[1:36:58] <%Razputin217> quiettMusic
[1:37:01] <Garry_Guyface> Welcome to the difficulty system
[1:37:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> this music reminds me of a good version of the buttrock in Killing FLoor
[1:37:08] <Tisaric> Seriously like every major mechanic in a Supergiant game originated in Bastion and that's so fucking cool
[1:37:09] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> Supergiant is very good at this specific game type
[1:37:13] <heartlesshealer> squirts
[1:37:13] <waltzqueen> Invoke the Gods! Puny Human!
[1:37:20] <heartlesshealer> gasbags are the hammer boys
[1:37:38] <garrulousAuthority> @SaltMaestroSupreme three games like this, and then wizard basketball
[1:37:39] <filialpails> I think you passed a secret
[1:38:02] <%tanarath> You missed a secret
[1:38:09] <+mrpheonix1212> he passed it twice in the field before the one with the shrine
[1:38:25] <heartlesshealer> bye secret
[1:38:26] <filialpails> you missed something in the fenced area to the north
[1:38:36] <waltzqueen> Secret Missed!
[1:38:44] <%Hasmeister96> Gravity 7?
[1:38:50] <heartlesshealer> destroy fence
[1:39:02] <%tanarath> Missed a secret
[1:39:05] <dukenux> thats a very 5th Element music
[1:39:10] <heartlesshealer> you did it
[1:39:15] <%GalacticaPhanto> would this be considered a roguelike
[1:39:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> IS IT SAND?
[1:39:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> SAND IS COARSE
[1:39:23] <Tisaric> no
[1:39:24] <1matheuw> gravity 8
[1:39:30] <+Pyroclase> I hate it when that happens
[1:39:30] <Tisaric> not even close to a roguelike
[1:39:34] <illegal_characters> @GalacticaPhanto no
[1:39:34] <+TheEmperorsEyebrows> I love the names for the upgrade materials
[1:39:41] <1matheuw> whoops
[1:39:41] <dukenux> nah, the levels aren't randomized
[1:39:41] <%tanarath> 8
[1:39:42] <+LandOfTheWay> LUL
[1:39:42] <%Fooguwu> man scream
[1:39:42] <heartlesshealer> clip scream
[1:39:44] <%Neryl_> monkaW
[1:39:44] <super_robo_mg> LUL
[1:39:47] <AnneSQF> ah
[1:39:48] <shinichizio> Manly noise
[1:39:49] <garrulousAuthority> it's the opposite of a roguelike you making progress is the whole plot
[1:39:51] <chaumiester> That was quite a manly scream
[1:39:53] <heartlesshealer> eat liquid

[1:47:49] <%CalderGaming> CLIP THAT
[1:47:50] <%king_wragles> Ya, Pat would eat like 50
[1:47:53] <heartlesshealer> you would eat 5
[1:47:58] <+Kirbachev> Oh hey, I remember Bastion. Great game.
[1:47:59] <+Pyroclase> what about that dessert that's just fake dog food?
[1:47:59] <SainEdge> Kappa
[1:47:59] <+chrishnaw> "Pat lied as naturally as he breathed"
[1:48:01] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> HE IS PAT
[1:48:02] <%SWFanatic> Nice
[1:48:03] <clloudberry> All taht kibble gave you the hiccups, I see
[1:48:09] <%BubbaRands> SOMEONE CLIP THAT LUL
[1:48:10] <%Ipsenscastle> Pat would eat kibble nine times
[1:48:14] <Marpolo13> nailed it
[1:48:16] <huarrnarg> Bastion is such a cute game, i remember playing it back in highschool in 2011
[1:48:17] <%toolofparanoia> I can't wait to hear what he sounds like when he is full grown
[1:48:31] <Tisaric> aw no music
[1:48:37] <%SWFanatic> That boy tried to eat the kibble, but he squeeled muchly and borked without hesitation
[1:48:37] <Tisaric> I want to play along so badly
[1:48:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> Huh....the Ura have the same religion
[1:48:43] <%Hasmeister96> Oh yeah don't you get blessings from the gods at some point?
[1:48:51] <illegal_characters> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:49:02] <huarrnarg> @toolofparanoia Zang will sound like a sub-woolfer
[1:49:02] <heartlesshealer> it has multiple dots
[1:49:06] <%dasmause> @Hasmeister96 no blessings
[1:49:10] <%dasmause> only curses
[1:49:12] <MrMatternot> He attacks cripples? What?
[1:49:14] <%SWFanatic> number go up
[1:49:16] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> Everybody loves marketable plush Jesus :)
[1:49:26] <Tisaric> oh no this one
[1:49:30] <penitentpentwitch> @MrMatternot It makes enemies slower
[1:49:31] <MrMatternot> Buddy Christ
[1:49:32] <Tisaric> this one is also extremely hard
[1:49:36] <Marpolo13> what would it be like to roll everywhere IRL to go faster?
[1:49:41] <Tisaric> IT"S SO GOOD
[1:49:47] <heartlesshealer> hell yeah it was
[1:50:03] <%Hasmeister96> @dasmause Huh OK. I remember there was a mechanic in the game in which the gods give you buffs or something
[1:50:04] <penitentpentwitch> There's a reason people are always excited when a game of theirs is announced.
[1:50:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> I fucking love the idea of trial by combat
[1:50:20] <Tisaric> they built their entire development for future games off this and they're all phenomonal
[1:50:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> like if its a test of the gods' favor just roll a die
[1:50:33] <%BinaryFireball> GUILtY
[1:50:41] <%Hasmeister96> @Marpolo13 Probably make my commute more interesting
[1:50:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> @BinaryFireball ask again later
[1:50:59] <+AtomicVR> This soundtrack is still so incredibly good. Darren Korb is a god.
[1:51:00] <Tisaric> yeah this trail is hard
[1:51:04] <Marpolo13> @Hasmeister96 true.
[1:51:14] <+ianabstract> this was another of the tough ones
[1:51:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> @BinaryFireball WAIT, if there's trial by combat, would a professional champion-for-hire be an Attorney At Arms?
[1:51:27] <BoneofMalkav> LUL
[1:51:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> I think i just found my next DND character
[1:51:39] <penitentpentwitch> First death goes to a challenge level, interesting
[1:51:43] <+ianabstract> also, probably a bad idea to do it with the bull god thing on
[1:51:49] <%Hasmeister96> @LiquidDinosaur Yes?
[1:51:49] <+lordericter> pat ignores the narrator here
[1:51:49] <%asgard147> "No, I'm eating Mom." psaDogchamp
[1:51:52] <%dasmause> i guess pat is not a smarter one
[1:52:04] <%BinaryFireball> @LiquidDinosaur Birdman Attorney at Arms
[1:52:07] <%SWFanatic> psaBig
[1:52:07] <+ianabstract> "Let this one fly off the edge of the level" the narrator says
[1:52:11] <%BinaryFireball> that would be a good episode
[1:52:12] <Tisaric> there's a reason this trial only gives you currency
[1:52:21] <super_robo_mg> coward!
[1:52:22] <clloudberry> PERFECT
[1:52:23] <heartlesshealer> the poison slime counts as a hit
[1:52:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> Wait, so whether you're guilty of a crime is determind by if you can parry good
[1:52:25] <penitentpentwitch> Gravity 9, Pat 0
[1:52:28] <+lordericter> good job pat
[1:52:30] <%CalderGaming> what is happening to pat
[1:52:30] <bluefooddye1> Just don't get hit 4Head
[1:52:42] <%SWFanatic> Pat coward confirmed
[1:52:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> "YOUR HONOR? MAY THE RECORD SHOW THAT THE DEFENDANT HAS LEVELED DEX"
[1:52:51] <%superc37> oh shit did i miss zia?
[1:52:52] <penitentpentwitch> @LiquidDinosaur The hypest courtroom for Woolie
[1:52:59] <RogueMinja> Royal Guard practice.
[1:53:02] <Sayie> Is Pat going to go through all the Supergiant games? How come?
[1:53:03] <%superc37> nice
[1:53:08] <garrulousAuthority> OBJECTION! ROYALGUARD IS NOT ALLOWED IN THIS COURT!
[1:53:13] <%superc37> tbf her song is REAL good
[1:53:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> @LiquidDinosaur Throw him in jail
[1:53:23] <%superc37> especially given nowadays
[1:53:30] <penitentpentwitch> @Sayie Hades is coming out 'soonish' so in celebration, marathon
[1:53:35] <garrulousAuthority> @Sayie in prepartion for Hades 1.0 release
[1:53:37] <%superc37> @sayie cuz hades
[1:53:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> Would you be allowed to bring a gun to parry or just shields
[1:53:49] <Sayie> Ohh thats awesome
[1:53:52] <garrulousAuthority> just shields
[1:54:12] <garrulousAuthority> if the shield of Pyth protects you, clearly you have God on your side
[1:54:17] <+Pyroclase> god, this soundtrack is amazing, I'm sad I've never heard it before
[1:54:23] <garrulousAuthority> it's the same logic as drowning witches
[1:54:29] <%Hasmeister96> @LiquidDinosaur Well I think the idea is that if you're guilty then God would cause you to falter somehow cos God wants the righteous to succeed, but that doesn't really makes sense considering God created the concept of evil
[1:54:41] <Tisaric> I have to wonder how people went so long without hearing this soundtrack
[1:54:44] <mcmuffin_n> when is hades out
[1:54:57] <Tisaric> it's everywhere and I know many people haven't played the game but know the big songs
[1:54:58] <+lordericter> failure

[1:56:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> UNINSTALL THE GAME, THAT'S IT
[1:56:10] <garrulousAuthority> Early Access
[1:56:14] <Tisaric> @Tisaric it's in early access

[1:57:14] <%SWFanatic> BIG
[1:57:16] <%DedlokPM> @garrulousAuthority covid 19 and expanding scope/things taking longer than expected more than likely
[1:57:25] <Tisaric> There's a weird subset of people that really didn't like Transistor's combat for some reason
[1:57:39] <%SWFanatic> psaBig
[1:57:40] <garrulousAuthority> oh no I don't mind about Hades take as long as they need

[1:59:31] <%Jaxnos> don't goof it up, now. that would just end up being hilarious
[1:59:34] <%SWFanatic> @SWFanatic Yeah, Its just it doesn't feel like fall
[1:59:36] <penitentpentwitch> The big problem is he's trying to cheese the last one, and that's got him the most hits with standing in goo
[1:59:43] <Garry_Guyface> Are you sure about that
[1:59:45] <thesuperquinn> Now this is a blast from the past
[1:59:53] <DawnsRoyal> is this blind?
[1:59:55] <%SolidusRex> @swfanatic Good, Halloween is allowed to shoe
[1:59:58] <super_robo_mg> pat is below baby level
[2:00:06] <Tisaric> its way harder to not "cheese" the gasbag
[2:00:15] <%SolidusRex> show up early
[2:00:17] <%Jaxnos> for babies
[2:00:17] <BleedinActionMan> Pat, have you played Hades?
[2:00:18] <%CalderGaming> 2!
[2:00:23] <penitentpentwitch> It's still good, it's still good
[2:00:26] <Tisaric> the game implies knocking him off his the correct way
[2:00:37] <dukenux> this seems slower when you see another person play it
[2:00:43] <%afronooch> LUL
[2:00:46] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Pat can do it you guys
[2:00:49] <Garry_Guyface> It's the one frame after they get done with their upswing that notes when to block
[2:00:55] <$apolitenoob> Too many vuln stacks pat, wipe it
[2:01:08] <penitentpentwitch> @Tisaric To cheese it, you stand near an edge and parry the first hit, the move out of the way the second charge so he goes over
[2:01:26] <%Jaxnos> lmao
[2:01:27] <%Divryne> LUL
[2:01:28] <penitentpentwitch> Wow the game
[2:01:29] <+cham52> omg thats such bullshit

[2:02:43] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> fang repeater and machete was my go to
[2:02:47] <penitentpentwitch> It looks like he's level 3 now?
[2:02:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> did you get a 3rd ale buff?
[2:03:01] <garrulousAuthority> I'm glad to see so many people main the machete
[2:03:22] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> Bourbon is good
[2:03:22] <%Tenebrae94> not gonna use the hammer?
[2:03:25] <Lophostrix_> bow all the way
[2:03:31] <+JingKaisean> Pat, which 3090 are you going to get?
[2:03:32] <%tanarath> Save cash for the second tier forge
[2:03:33] <penitentpentwitch> Bastion Bourbon!
[2:03:50] <%laserbeaming> I remember Bastion Bourbon being good
[2:04:00] <%arcielardor> that's where the shotgun is
[2:04:05] <PortableBoredom> Okay but how many somersaults in a row could you do before barfing
[2:04:05] <Parapattern> UGH
[2:04:09] <ShinobiPhoenix> if Pat pays 1500 bucks for a card NOW, he be crazy
[2:04:15] <+JingKaisean> Which is the best one?
[2:04:16] <penitentpentwitch> More Estus is always good
[2:04:28] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> oh yeah that s the build
[2:05:09] <penitentpentwitch> I love that skilled play triggers alternate dialogue
[2:05:13] <cascadepersona> @patstaresat I just finished ARR and am wondering if I should do the EX Trials/Coil of Bahamut or continue into Heavensward? Thanks.
[2:05:17] <%SWFanatic> WHAM
[2:05:20] <%Fooguwu> Zia's theme is the kind of tune you'll find yourself humming every so often for the rest of your life
[2:05:21] <+cham52> man this game's artstyle aged really gracefully
[2:05:27] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> the music in this was some of my favorite when it came out
[2:05:43] <%Hasmeister96> GUN!!
[2:05:47] <%SWFanatic> yeah music is fantastic in all the supergiant games
[2:05:57] <%Fooguwu> same. they're both so good individually and then they hit you with that amazing mashup
[2:05:58] <penitentpentwitch> Musket! My baby!
[2:05:59] <garrulousAuthority> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:05:59] <+cham52> GUNSLINGER
[2:06:03] <%Ipsenscastle> I've been humming Zia's song almost daily for a decade
[2:06:09] <LilacsandFreedom> this music got me through the worst paper I ever had to write, and I will forever be grateful
[2:06:12] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> THE SHOTTY PogChamp
[2:06:13] <Parapattern> My favorite@
[2:06:13] <%Ipsenscastle> it's legit my go-to humming song
[2:06:14] <RedPlasticCup> power of GUN
[2:06:14] <%Razputin217> inochiBang
[2:06:17] <Sayie> Darren Korb fucking kills it with every game he's worked on
[2:06:18] <Louie_Salmon> SWORD-TRICK-GUN
[2:06:18] <Meekest> I don't remember the Bastion protag being so beefy looking
[2:06:25] <super_robo_mg> @cascadepersona you might have trouble finding groups for coil of bahamut, especially if you do it synched
[2:06:26] <+LandOfTheWay> SHAWTGUN
[2:06:28] <%SWFanatic> psaDab
[2:06:31] <Tisaric> The way everything comes together like even the lyrics are applicable to the story, it's so fucking good
[2:06:33] <garrulousAuthority> The Kid for Smash when
[2:06:37] <Parapattern> Oh wait, that's not the pistols
[2:06:38] <gamezerox> WOO Shotgun!
[2:06:45] <%SWFanatic> Insanity shotgun
[2:07:00] <garrulousAuthority> Pargon Pargon Pargon Pargon Pargon
[2:07:01] <%DedlokPM> rooGun
[2:07:03] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt Have you played Hades?
[2:07:03] <%CalderGaming> @garrulousAuthority he can't jump
[2:07:03] <penitentpentwitch> Heavy Ma-Shotgun
[2:07:20] <cascadepersona> @super_robo_mg So should I just go into Heavensward or try out EX Trials (primarily via Duty Finder)? Also, thanks for the response.
[2:07:23] <%toolofparanoia> YOU SEIZED THE SHOTGUN
[2:07:26] <penitentpentwitch> Gravity 10, Pat 1
[2:07:29] <%Tenebrae94> can you do a double gun build?
[2:07:29] <%Razputin217> Blunderbuss
[2:07:29] <Garry_Guyface> ROYAL GUA-GUNSLINGER
[2:07:30] <garrulousAuthority> turn him into Sonic and let him summon a Skyway
[2:07:39] <garrulousAuthority> Or just give him the shitty jump he gets later on
[2:07:47] <Tisaric> @BleedinActionMan he's played it in an earlier state but not recently I don't think
[2:07:53] <%Albadabar> Hell yeah, machete and musket, my go to set-up
[2:07:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> I love how weird windbags are
[2:07:57] <%tanarath> 11
[2:08:08] <%SWFanatic> try spinning
[2:08:10] <garrulousAuthority> Machete and musket took me through the whole game
[2:08:27] <%MassConnect> why does pat get a point?
[2:08:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> and how they just kind of weird elementals that were second class citizens
[2:08:36] <ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt Is all of Final Fantasy XIV under the "need/greed" system or is there some "instanced loot" available. my mind goblins are strong when it comes to doing all that work and then someone get my loot because they hit "need".
[2:08:38] <penitentpentwitch> Gravity 11, Pat 1
[2:08:48] <$RealThiele> curse you, gravity
[2:09:16] <%DedlokPM> @ShinobiPhoenix only dungeon chest loot is need greed
[2:09:26] <+Con_fusedDX> It's crazy that this game is 9 years old
[2:09:27] <%toolofparanoia> GASSIES
[2:09:40] <dukenux> Gassholes
[2:09:42] <+akira_chong> I just got here. So what's the consensus about the Super Mario 3D World "Disney Vault" thing?
[2:09:45] <%DedlokPM> @ShinobiPhoenix well, duneon/raid
[2:09:48] <%toolofparanoia> Time flies
[2:10:25] <dukenux> i hope people will treat it the same as Disney bullshit
[2:10:29] <%toolofparanoia> Nintendo is making limited release content
[2:10:32] <+RisingFalls1> @ShinobiPhoenix Also something to keep in mind is if you are a black mage for example you can't roll Need on a piece of Tank Gear.
[2:10:35] <ShinobiPhoenix> so what happens if you are in a party and loot drops from an enemy you killed? can other people pick up my loot?
[2:10:52] <Psyramics> loot doesn't drop from enemies
[2:10:58] <Louie_Salmon> LUL
[2:11:00] <$apolitenoob> Loot's only gonna come from chests
[2:11:02] <+RisingFalls1> @ShinobiPhoenix Loot only drops on bosses not mobs.
[2:11:02] <dirtyh4rr1> LUL
[2:11:03] <$RealThiele> limited release ports
[2:11:05] <clockworknait1> love that song!
[2:11:07] <+akira_chong> @dukenux You mean put up with it?
[2:11:11] <%the22cstomp> crazy talk
[2:11:11] <penitentpentwitch> Melee vs Flamethrower, not the best matchup
[2:11:13] <cascadepersona> @akira_chong The 3D All Stars thing is stupid and only serves to benefit scalpers. On the plus side, you can turn a profit in the near future, if you're so inclined.
[2:11:16] <ShinobiPhoenix> so enemies are only for EXP?
[2:11:23] <+cham52> The way projectiles speed up when reflected is so dang satisfying
[2:11:25] <Tisaric> the general consensus is that we hope Nintendo seperates the ports once the "limited time" ends but it's bullshit either way
[2:11:34] <%the22cstomp> SourPls
[2:11:36] <StaticSunrise> THROW THE MACHETE
[2:11:41] <+Kirbachev> One of the best tunes in the game
[2:11:42] <%SWFanatic> psaBig
[2:11:44] <Psyramics> open world enemies will drop crafting materials, but you'll never be competing with anyone for those drops
[2:11:52] <Louie_Salmon> Wow I never noticed they actually mine out some of the ground
[2:11:58] <Psyramics> and enemies in dungeons are only for EXP
[2:11:59] <ShinobiPhoenix> so what happens when someone else in your party opens a chest?
[2:12:12] <illegal_characters> Throwing edged weapons is for the old times
[2:12:12] <Psyramics> you all get a chance to roll on whatever is inside
[2:12:15] <$RealThiele> you kill them for the loot
[2:12:19] <illegal_characters> FORBIDDEN
[2:12:30] <+Pyroclase> The narrator not being able to remember the names of bosses is amazing
[2:12:41] <ShinobiPhoenix> even when outside a dungeon or raid?
[2:12:45] <+RisingFalls1> @ShinobiPhoenix Loot from chests is show to everyone, if its for your class your can Need / Greed / Pass.
[2:12:46] <%DedlokPM> @ShinobiPhoenix window pops up notifying rollable loot is available and you click on it and choose need/greed/pass
[2:12:49] <ShinobiPhoenix> like you're just running around exploring
[2:12:51] <%CalderGaming> @PatStaresAt note that the pickaxe guys always tilt forward a bit after their windup and before they actually strike
[2:12:54] <Psyramics> there are no chests outside dungeons or raids
[2:12:59] <+RisingFalls1> If someone else tries to roll and they're not eligible to need they can only Greed / Pass.
[2:13:04] <cascadepersona> @shinobiphoenix All chests opened are available to need/greed between all party members. Outside of dungeons, you claim all loot as your own.
[2:13:06] <$RealThiele> not like dis
[2:13:15] <Tisaric> you don't get equips outside of dungeons
[2:13:23] <clockworknait1> I also like the " you build a wall I dig a hole" song
[2:13:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> Kid wanted to be a cop? wooliePOYO
[2:13:33] <cascadepersona> MSQ gives you your own gear, as well.
[2:13:34] <Tisaric> they're just not what you want
[2:13:40] <ShinobiPhoenix> wait? loot can't be gained AT ALL except from dungeons? you can't solo the game?
[2:13:40] <%SWFanatic> psaDogchamp
[2:13:43] <$joylent_blue> yoooo this supergiant layout is awesome
[2:13:50] <$RealThiele> hes pretty white so id say yea
[2:13:52] <+RisingFalls1> You can earn gear from questing, doing dungeons, and then from Tomestones.
[2:13:54] <dukenux> the ending song joints Zulf and Zia's songs
[2:13:56] <Psyramics> you can craft or buy gear from vendors
[2:14:00] <+cham52> Zangief is eating up the whole stream setup
[2:14:00] <Psyramics> the MSQ will give you gear
[2:14:00] <penitentpentwitch> @Pyroclase I mean, doesn't he never asks the Kid his name the whole game?
[2:14:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Why is his voice rubbing the clit I don't have
[2:14:04] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> "He's cutting the feed. Your up next Elmo"
[2:14:07] <%templar010> PUPPER
[2:14:08] <%brackboi> psaDogchamp
[2:14:10] <Parapattern> The Boy?
[2:14:11] <LoneFonte> the BOY
[2:14:12] <+RisingFalls1> 50 / 60 / 70 has gear you buy from vendors for doing other content.
[2:14:13] <Pookiedaexzile> What is this game, and who this man
[2:14:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> Hmmm they treated him with dignity despite his white anime hair explicitly being a thing that caused social ostracism. So idk i guess they were ok?
[2:14:25] <Parapattern> BOY!
[2:14:28] <ShinobiPhoenix> so the only way to get "good" gear is to play with others?
[2:14:28] <%SWFanatic> MercyWing1 psaDogchamp MercyWing2
[2:14:31] <%Fooguwu> @Pookiedaexzile a dick is just a big clit really
[2:14:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Pookiedaexzile it's Sandstorm and the man is Darude
[2:14:32] <%Ipsenscastle> @Pookiedaexzile Bastion, Logan Cunningham
[2:14:38] <tkuwari> Zangief stares at the sun UNBLINKING
[2:14:40] <Tisaric> Yeah the supergiant layout is fucking great
[2:14:41] <penitentpentwitch> High Mode is go!
[2:14:42] <$RealThiele> it Could be HIS food
[2:14:42] <Psyramics> no, you can craft good gear
[2:14:44] <+Loinclothiclese> @LiquidDinosaur was talking about zulf not the kid
[2:14:50] <Psyramics> its very hard to do, but its possible
[2:14:52] <+Manooz> Bastion is one of the best games ever made don't @ me
[2:14:54] <weirdmothgirl> Crank that hook babey
[2:14:54] <+RisingFalls1> You can also get it from crafting. :)
[2:14:58] <+Neoripo> NotLikeThis RalpherZ
[2:15:00] <%Ipsenscastle> @LiquidDinosaur that's such a good answer
[2:15:01] <Psyramics> or you could buy it off the Market Board (for a lot of money)
[2:15:03] <Parapattern> BONG
[2:15:03] <+RisingFalls1> FFXIV gives you a lot of options.
[2:15:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Pookiedaexzile if you mean who the streamer is, Pat
[2:15:13] <%toolofparanoia> This is Bastion, and the game's narrator is one of the best fucking parts of it
[2:15:15] <cascadepersona> @shinobiphoenix You get gear from Main Story Quests and Job Quests, which are solo. Dungeons can be done with a pre-made party or through Duty Finder, which is a lobby system that pairs you with random. You can also craft your own gear from the Crafter jobs.
[2:15:20] <clockworknait1> Kid wanna get up then kid get touched Kid wanna stick up then kid get stuck I'm the one that called your bluff
[2:15:22] <+cham52> time to get them DRUGS
[2:15:25] <%Fooguwu> DRUGS
[2:15:25] <penitentpentwitch> Earn that backstory!
[2:15:27] <%CalderGaming> WASTED
[2:15:28] <DawnsRoyal> did pat loose weight?
[2:15:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Loinclothiclese hmmm, okay that's still p good i guess if the cops didnt harass him for being a citizen of their mortal enemy
[2:15:36] <%CalderGaming> THERE IS NO ESCAPE
[2:15:38] <%Razputin217> Imma TRIP BALLS
[2:15:40] <%Fooguwu> that's a great line
[2:15:41] <weirdmothgirl> Boy cant hold his apocalypse weed wll
[2:15:42] <Psyramics> you are going to have do group content, but the duty finder makes it very painless
[2:15:43] <+StooEsq> that good shit
[2:15:45] <ShinobiPhoenix> I saw FFXIV for 20 bucks on Steam and thought about snatching it, but not if I am forced to play with others for the good stuff
[2:15:45] <%Ipsenscastle> oh man the final drug trip level was brutal using the difficulty mods
[2:15:45] <+Pyroclase> Oh hey, "return to bastion" was also a prompt in Red Faction Armageddon.
[2:15:48] <gamezerox> did the pipe glitch?
[2:15:49] <Tisaric> Oh I love these horde modes
[2:15:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes Jazz Man tell me of this Jrpeg
[2:15:51] <Parapattern> PCP. Angel Dust.
[2:15:56] <%TheFabledAble> fuckin lightweight
[2:15:58] <ShinobiPhoenix> Pre-made party of NPC's?
[2:15:58] <%Fooguwu> "is history" like it's gone, the good stuff is gone, so what's the point in thinking on it
[2:16:03] <Tisaric> @ShinobiPhoenix it's an mmo, that's kind of the point really
[2:16:15] <$RealThiele> Crafting your own gear in FF14 is a pain unless you buy everything or Omnicraft
[2:16:15] <Psyramics> Its free to play up to level 60, the only thing it'll cost you if you dont like it is time
[2:16:17] <$joylent_blue> the VA for the Narrator is named Logan Cunningham, for those wondering
[2:16:25] <cascadepersona> @shinobiphoenix Pre-Made Party of other players.
[2:16:25] <%SWFanatic> You can smooth my bore rifle anytime
[2:16:29] <+Solutha> you have to do dungeons and raids to progress in ff14
[2:16:40] <%TheFabledAble> @Fooguwu the consequences of the past means history is forever relevent, as it can keep us from repeating our mistakes
[2:16:47] <%toolofparanoia> What's Cunningham doing now?
[2:16:51] <Psyramics> its an MMO, group content is going to be a thing
[2:16:55] <DawnsRoyal> @ShinobiPhoenix in the latetst expansion you can do all the dungeons with npcs, but until then you gotta run with other players
[2:16:56] <Tisaric> Hades
[2:16:59] <$RealThiele> history may not repeat but it rhymes
[2:17:00] <+RisingFalls1> MSQ forces you into dungeons throughout the storyline so you will have to play with others.
[2:17:03] <%the22cstomp> it's cool that there's unique voice lines for different loadouts
[2:17:03] <+Manooz> personally the machete and the rifle/shotty were my go to
[2:17:04] <%Fooguwu> @TheFabledAble ya ya it's just a cool cowboy line
[2:17:08] <Tisaric> Logan is a full time VA for Supergiant
[2:17:11] <+Manooz> the bleed on the machete was fuckin legit
[2:17:18] <%GarbageNirvana> Logan also did the voice of Zagreus in Hades iirc
[2:17:20] <Pookiedaexzile> "Ever since we clapped there cheeks back in the War, the Unbounded have fear the Marshals and there two full pipes of domination
[2:17:22] <$joylent_blue> toolofparanoia mostly Supergiant stuff
[2:17:24] <%toolofparanoia> Noice
[2:17:25] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I remember liking pistols in this game
[2:17:27] <ShinobiPhoenix> plenty of people play MMO's solo, at least until they are comfortable. I'm super introverted or at least I had a very scarring experience in old WoW where a friend I was partying with got some loot and wasn't even fighting the enemy I was
[2:17:29] <Tisaric> No Zag is Darren
[2:17:40] <Tisaric> Hades the actual god is Logan
[2:17:40] <+Tomschiii> @GarbageNirvana nop, that was darren
[2:17:41] <%TheFabledAble> oh xD
[2:17:43] <Parapattern> Pistols were just the best
[2:17:43] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh, my bad
[2:17:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> Stop smoking weed
[2:17:49] <ShinobiPhoenix> and that sort of thing hits my mind goblins hard. I want to get what I earned
[2:17:51] <+lordericter> oh this is the kids dream
[2:17:55] <%DedlokPM> @Tisaric He isn't exclusive to them though. He has done VA for other games and things.
[2:17:56] <dukenux> Kid remembers about "puff", but forgets about "pass"...
[2:17:56] <+lordericter> this one is fucked up
[2:18:02] <$RealThiele> start smoking weed
[2:18:04] <$joylent_blue> yeah Zag is voiced by Darren Korb, who is the main music composer for all the games
[2:18:12] <Parapattern> The Kid is super into drugs
[2:18:20] <+Tomschiii> but even darren, the composer, is such a great voice actor
[2:18:24] <DawnsRoyal> @ShinobiPhoenix loot stealing is virtually impossible in ff14, and the community is genrally seen as one of the best you can find on the internet
[2:18:24] <+Tomschiii> such talented people
[2:18:25] <dukenux> Is Zag the narrator?
[2:18:26] <Tisaric> @Tisaric Oh yeah totally, he's just officially hired by them and works for them in a stable way really
[2:18:27] <+RisingFalls1> @ShinobiPhoenix FFXIV is nothing like WoW.
[2:18:30] <+Loinclothiclese> @Parapattern hes a drinker too lol
[2:18:38] <Psyramics> no one will be getting unearned loot in a dungeon in FF14
[2:18:40] <%GarbageNirvana> So much talent at this studio
[2:18:58] <candidateplays> The Narrator is Logan Cunningham, who plays hades, Zeus and Poseidon
[2:18:59] <%Fooguwu> that falling animation is hilarious lol
[2:19:06] <Tisaric> The studio is basically the same as this game's dev team with a couple additions here and there it's insane
[2:19:07] <$RealThiele> most dungeon loot is bad anyways LUL
[2:19:07] <ShinobiPhoenix> not stealing, he hit need on my item and got it and I almost turned the game off.
[2:19:09] <dukenux> i remember having trouble with dream parts
[2:19:17] <Vashido22> YO BASTION? Pog
[2:19:21] <dukenux> "Kid... had a hard life"
[2:19:21] <Parapattern> That fall animation cracks me up every time
[2:19:32] <Vashido22> wait, DOES THIS MEAN PAT WILL PLAY PYRE?
[2:19:39] <penitentpentwitch> Nice/Bad thing is the Gods influence these arenas. Bonuses and problems.
[2:19:42] <dukenux> M-mother?
[2:19:42] <%Fooguwu> "she was a protagonist too"
[2:19:43] <$joylent_blue> Vashido22 yep
[2:19:50] <+cham52> With pure DISGUSTING white hair
[2:19:52] <Vashido22> @joylent_blue YESSSSS
[2:19:58] <+Tomschiii> i still wonder how he did" the voice" in pyre. its such a different tone from th enarrator
[2:20:06] <Psyramics> people rolling on things you want is something you're gonna have to deal with in any MMO
[2:20:15] <%laserbeaming> you turnbed on that shrine
[2:20:17] <Tisaric> @ShinobiPhoenix that's pretty much how loot is set up in every MMO, you can't just drop everything for everyone
[2:20:18] <+RisingFalls1> @ShinobiPhoenix Keep in mind in a dungeon or raid setting if you and are both playing the same class and a piece of gear drops and it could be considered an upgrade for both you and I we could both roll need and it would go the higher roll.
[2:20:22] <Psyramics> but they will have just as much a right to roll on it as you will
[2:20:23] <Vashido22> I love all supergiant games, but Pyre is easily my favourite
[2:20:25] <TheA1ternative> has pat played this game b4 or not?
[2:20:31] <%Hasmeister96> @dukenux Yeah I think the story is he is the sole breadwinner for him and his mum, so joined the city garrison
[2:20:32] <DawnsRoyal> @ShinobiPhoenix for gear in ff14 dungeons you can literally only need roll if you current class can equip that gear
[2:20:32] <%SWFanatic> get glooped
[2:20:35] <$joylent_blue> his Transistor voice is more "normal" but is equally Kreygasm
[2:20:40] <Tisaric> Pat has played Bastion/Transistor
[2:20:43] <%TheFabledAble> ff14 and wow share similar DNA in terms of questing and gear progression (ff14 gear is basically just stat sticks) the emphasis on playing your role within a "trinity" is similar also, only ff14 makes dps from tanks and healers vital to success
[2:20:43] <%Hasmeister96> @TheA1ternative played it at launch
[2:20:49] <aeonicvector> cant hit need unless its your role, need ALWAYS beats greed, so you werent robbed of any gear, and if you were, its gear they had equal claim to
[2:20:55] <dukenux> Transistor is my favorite fow now
[2:20:57] <$joylent_blue> Pat has only played like an hour of Transistor
[2:20:57] <+cham52> Hades too
[2:20:59] <Tisaric> I don't think he's gone through much of Pyre and has only played early Hades
[2:20:59] <dukenux> *for
[2:21:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Feels like this dude is playing a sax and pausing to tell us a story
[2:21:21] <Pookiedaexzile> they just cut out the jazz
[2:21:23] <Tisaric> He's said he went through Transistor I thought
[2:21:29] <+Loinclothiclese> BibleThump
[2:21:32] <Tisaric> Pyre is the only one that he only put an hour in
[2:21:34] <+Manooz> BibleThump
[2:21:35] <Vashido22> FeelsBadMan
[2:21:35] <heartlesshealer> >:
[2:21:49] <%DedlokPM> That is literally what you turned on in the patheon @PatStaresAt "Foes shall have vengeance in the throes of defeat"
[2:21:50] <%Razputin217> inochiCry
[2:21:51] <+Loinclothiclese> pat use the jumps lol
[2:21:51] <Tisaric> SourPls
[2:21:59] <+Loinclothiclese> use the jumps
[2:21:59] <$joylent_blue> i like 90% it was Transistor pvpThink
[2:22:07] <SomeAsianDood> Pyre is my favorite. idk why but sportsball games not by EA/2K are hype af
[2:22:08] <Vashido22> SourPls
[2:22:10] <$joylent_blue> but w/e, he'll play them all anyway
[2:22:17] <penitentpentwitch> Floor stays gone, it's why they're dangerous
[2:22:23] <Vashido22> I love Pyre so much
[2:22:27] <dukenux> i love Transistor's process system
[2:22:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> Wait so he just didnt know his mom was dead and stuff but he was just the city's defense?
[2:22:35] <Tisaric> He definitely hasn't gone through Pyre at all
[2:22:35] <Vashido22> THE THING
[2:22:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> LIke he wasnt even deployed anywhere he was on the city wall
[2:22:41] <+Manooz> This is wh ythe machete is amazing here, you can throw it and it'll inflict the bleed
[2:22:45] <%toolofparanoia> free guy?
[2:22:46] <Tisaric> I think all he's seen was the best friends video
[2:22:48] <$joylent_blue> Pyre's OST is worth a playthrough by itself
[2:22:57] <+Tomschiii> i love the different skill sets in transistor, but hate the gameplay and the gameplay loop
[2:23:01] <%Razputin217> The Kid Dies Twice
[2:23:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> Why not? how bad can it be compared to the other shit
[2:23:09] <Tisaric> oh yeah Pyre probably actually has my favorite OST overall
[2:23:12] <aeonicvector> Pyre's story and world is worth a playthough all by itself
[2:23:12] <Tisaric> but it's super close
[2:23:21] <Vashido22> Pyre's ost is godlike
[2:23:27] <+Loinclothiclese> @LiquidDinosaur work not defense
[2:23:28] <dukenux> i liked gameplay way more in Transistor than in Bastion
[2:23:35] <LoneFonte> Pyre has no much fucking music
[2:23:38] <LoneFonte> so*
[2:23:41] <$RealThiele> LEGO boi
[2:23:51] <Vashido22> and its so good
[2:23:57] <penitentpentwitch> Musket/Hammer is a viable combo, at least
[2:23:59] <+cham52> You're super doing it tho pat
[2:24:01] <Vashido22> so many different styles and genres too
[2:24:02] <DawnsRoyal> pyres gameplay and progression unforunately gets in the way of the nice music and world BibleThump
[2:24:04] <%tanarath> @patstaresat The movement speed wjile your shield is up liquor is additive, so it's really great for moving like you seem to.
[2:24:04] <Tisaric> Literally every Supergiant soundtrack competes for the top 4 for me, they're all just so fuckign good
[2:24:08] <Pookiedaexzile> "Trusted"
[2:24:16] <ShinobiPhoenix> I like PSO2, it's instanced loot and enemies drop loot and it's all only for me. if the RNG just decides the loot doesn't drop, that's fine, but I hate the idea that the game is like "do you want it? nope, it's going to your friend?" It's very mind goblin. I would rather not see that it effectively dropped for me and I didn't get it because of further RNG. AGain, I admit, it's very Mind Goblin
[2:24:24] <chambatron> When's space jam tho
[2:24:24] <Vashido22> I really enjoy pyre's gameplay personaly
[2:24:25] <Vashido22> its fun
[2:24:31] <Tisaric> I adore Pyre's gameplay and progression
[2:24:39] <LoneFonte> Dread Design Kreygasm
[2:24:44] <+Tomschiii> the music is perfectly layed out to the genre of pyre.
[2:24:59] <Tisaric> sounds like MMOs don't fit your mind goblins then honestly
[2:25:12] <Tisaric> need/greed rolling is a staple of most of them
[2:25:17] <$RealThiele> Pyre is ok, for me its missing. . . something i cant explain it but i dont find the loop satisfying
[2:25:38] <+chase959> did he just smoke the pipe?
[2:25:40] <+Loinclothiclese> pyre was not fun to me at all
[2:25:41] <ShinobiPhoenix> MMOs that play and act like Diablo, sure, at lesat they hide it from me.
[2:25:46] <Vashido22> thats fair, everything about it did click with me
[2:25:48] <$joylent_blue> loved Pyre, felt it dragged just a little long near the end, but overall very enjoyable
[2:25:49] <Vashido22> thats why I loved it
[2:25:50] <+Loinclothiclese> @chase959 yes
[2:25:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> @chase959 yes these arenas are just you getting super high
[2:26:04] <Vashido22> SourPls
[2:26:10] <%CzeekyPlays> SourPls
[2:26:12] <Tisaric> you get rich
[2:26:12] <ShinobiPhoenix> but yaeh, I technically haven't found an MMO for me and I am TRYING to be more social
[2:26:16] <$RealThiele> Kid, you ever tried DMT?
[2:26:19] <%Razputin217> quiettMusic
[2:26:20] <+Loinclothiclese> SourPls
[2:26:23] <aeonicvector> i gotta disagree on that one joylent, the end of Pyre goes WAY too fast
[2:26:23] <penitentpentwitch> Money, Exp and most importantly LORE
[2:26:25] <%Hasmeister96> I think you just get more currency
[2:26:28] <+JPM1993> Pog
[2:26:28] <%SolidusRex> You get backstory
[2:26:30] <theanora1> XP good enough?
[2:26:32] <aeonicvector> with way fewer matches in teh last half
[2:26:36] <+lordericter> you get the greatest reward of all Pat, Lore
[2:26:37] <JaseAdrift> Bastion music slaps
[2:26:37] <LoneFonte> SoirPls
[2:26:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> @penitentpentwitch waiting for that final arena lore
[2:26:43] <LoneFonte> SourPls
[2:26:49] <+Loinclothiclese> @penitentpentwitch LORE Kreygasm
[2:26:53] <Tisaric> I think Pyre would've dragged if the last matches weren't shortened though
[2:27:03] <ShinobiPhoenix> I need an activity to do with people on my days off and I would like to get into an MMO
[2:27:03] <+lordericter> and a lot of money
[2:27:04] <%Hasmeister96> Pat use the jump thingies to evade
[2:27:06] <LoneFonte> LUL
[2:27:07] <+Tomschiii> it would be too much with more matched till the end
[2:27:07] <Vashido22> LUL
[2:27:11] <Tisaric> It was definitely starting to get a bit repetitive at the end so the less matches are nice
[2:27:12] <+cham52> LUL
[2:27:13] <penitentpentwitch> Gravity 12, Pat 1
[2:27:17] <+Loinclothiclese> FailFish
[2:27:28] <$RealThiele> FF14 is free to get into, if you like FF music and are ok with small grinds its fun
[2:27:45] <%GalacticaPhanto> Pyre I feel is the least favorite of Supergiants games. least meaning not as loved as the other 3
[2:27:50] <%dasmause> how did pat get a 1 point with gravity?
[2:28:03] <Vashido22> it is the weirdest one
[2:28:05] <+Tomschiii> because people dont like to read
[2:28:08] <Tisaric> yeah Pyre is definitely their odd sheep and they embrace that
[2:28:11] <Vashido22> but its my personal favourite
[2:28:18] <ShinobiPhoenix> I love PSO2 but none of my friends who like MMOs are playing it, usually they say it's too fast for them and they have to play it very differently from WoW or FF
[2:28:19] <%SWFanatic> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:28:21] <$RealThiele> i was elected to lead, not to read!
[2:28:22] <vVAstrAVv> which is too bad cus pyre is their best game
[2:28:23] <RedPlasticCup> PUPPO
[2:28:25] <Tisaric> I love it but I understand it's not really what people would want
[2:28:28] <$RealThiele> PEE
[2:28:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> what about Everquest
[2:28:33] <+Loinclothiclese> @GalacticaPhanto 100%
[2:28:34] <+cham52> It's your fault for admonishing the puppy
[2:28:39] <ShinobiPhoenix> @RealThiele Free other than the $20 bucks on Steam or am I missing something?
[2:28:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> did you know they STILL make new expansions for Everquest
[2:28:40] <waltzqueen> Pyre is the weordo sibling of the family but it made me have a lot of emotions so i ended up loving it the most
[2:28:41] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> avoids finder dmg
[2:28:44] <penitentpentwitch> @dasmause An enemy floated in midair to deny pat a victory, he still won in the end though
[2:28:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> 1 a year
[2:28:46] <Parapattern> Get 'im!
[2:28:47] <$joylent_blue> its more visual novel-y than their other games
[2:28:55] <oAznoUta> fist was how we would tell our dogs to sit
[2:28:57] <+lordericter> fist fight the dog stronger
[2:29:00] <Psyramics> @RealThiele Look up the free trial
[2:29:01] <+StooEsq> Fists are scary, just ask Ubisoft
[2:29:03] <%SWFanatic> F
[2:29:07] <Zebroneath> Game audio is a bit loud. Can't really hear Paige.
[2:29:08] <Vashido22> welp
[2:29:10] <BoSteed> Man punches dog. More at 11.
[2:29:10] <+buttdirt> that's the right thing to do, gotta train them while they're young that biting with force is not okay
[2:29:10] <Vashido22> thats that
[2:29:11] <+cham52> I'd believe you were punchiing each other in the face before I believe you were hurting your pets tbh
[2:29:12] <DawnsRoyal> @ShinobiPhoenix the free trial goes up to lvl 60 and includes the base game and all of the first expansion
[2:29:13] <%CalderGaming> those fucking Killer Instinct Omen fireballs
[2:29:13] <SomeAsianDood> At least they took the ridiculous amount of dialogue and used it for Hades
[2:29:13] <%coreyyotto> psaBig F
[2:29:15] <%GalacticaPhanto> Pyre has my favorite character designs tho
[2:29:15] <Tisaric> @RealThiele it is completely free to play up to level 60(?) now, steam version will start a sub
[2:29:16] <vVAstrAVv> wouldnt shock me if a shit like pat hit dog
[2:29:19] <%Hasmeister96> dammit zangief
[2:29:20] <SomeAsianDood> Hades dialogue is nuts
[2:29:23] <Vashido22> yeah we can hear you
[2:29:25] <Vashido22> audio is fine
[2:29:29] <+lordericter> Easy mode is now selectable
[2:29:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> what if you confused Visual Novels and Graphic Novels
[2:29:30] <+discognition> whale drink at lost and found
[2:29:31] <ShiningAxis> audio is fine
[2:29:41] <Zebroneath> Ah, gotcha. You're good then.
[2:29:43] <%Hasmeister96> @vVAstrAVv What?
[2:29:43] <Vashido22> NotLikeThis
[2:29:47] <+Tomschiii> @GalacticaPhanto wel, it has the biggest cast ^^
[2:29:48] <Tisaric> hell yeah it counts too
[2:29:52] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[2:29:54] <ShinobiPhoenix> I can't download the free trial on PS4 anymore, so I thought I would look up on Steam when I saw it in my list. I only see the $20 price tag
[2:29:58] <Tisaric> God there's so much dialogue recorded
[2:30:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> WAIT. What youtube series has that same THUNK sound?
[2:30:07] <Rei_Dsoto> It's a Pat
[2:30:10] <Cjjb1995> Haha, came into the stream to hear "Go Fuck Yourself"
[2:30:11] <penitentpentwitch> Ha ha, no
[2:30:11] <+lordericter> no do it all again
[2:30:17] <DawnsRoyal> @ShinobiPhoenix you can 100% get the free trial on ps4 right now
[2:30:18] <Vashido22> hahahaha
[2:30:19] <Vashido22> no
[2:30:26] <@PeachSaliva> @vvastravv Pat is not a shit :(
[2:30:30] <aeonicvector> nope, this is a lore dumb piece of bonus content like bloody palace
[2:30:33] <+cham52> jesus that thing is an smg
[2:30:34] <%SaiyanShoto> It’s funny how when Paige isn’t near the mic it’s a little hard to hear her but when Pat is all the way across the room away from his mic we hear him clearly LUL
[2:30:35] <%velemi> no this is a challenge thing, no mercy will be given
[2:30:36] <%Piemen99> cute you think that
[2:30:39] <Tisaric> @ShinobiPhoenix Go to the main site, not on steam. The steam listing is basically an old thing that is outdated at this point
[2:30:44] <%tinyswampthing> hurry powers back
[2:30:50] <Vashido22> there's a reason this challenge is optional
[2:30:53] <Vashido22> do it for the LORE
[2:30:54] <LoneFonte> @DawnsRoyal not if you also got the free month in july(?)
[2:30:54] <ShinobiPhoenix> it says "Unavailable" when I look at it from PSN store on console, so I stopped trying
[2:31:02] <$RealThiele> yea FF14 on steam entry is antiquated go direct
[2:31:10] <Psyramics> @ShinobiPhoenix check the Download Demo button
[2:31:13] <Vashido22> @ShinobiPhoenix you mean the ff14 trial?
[2:31:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Vashido22 cant wait for the final lore gauntlet
[2:31:51] <aeonicvector> you mean the Pantheon gauntlet?
[2:31:52] <ShinobiPhoenix> yeah, on my PSN it said unavailable. I had previously downloaded and deleted the demo and now it says unavailable
[2:32:08] <Vashido22> @ShinobiPhoenix I couldn't find the ff14 trial either, but you can just use google to get it
[2:32:18] <$RealThiele> im also impressed at controller support for FF14, it is pretty usuable on PC
[2:32:21] <$RealThiele> we sure are
[2:32:28] <+Pyroclase> I allowed myself to get back into WoW instead
[2:32:28] <Vashido22> just open the store on your browser
[2:32:28] <Tisaric> I don't know about PS4 but I imagine you just use the normal FFXIV page to download the trial now
[2:32:29] <%Hasmeister96> eh mmos don't do it for me
[2:32:32] <Vashido22> and you should find it
[2:32:33] <Chimeraelite> Literally leveling DRK right now. Only like 43 but its progress
[2:32:39] <%tanarath> i would NOT buy it on steam
[2:32:39] <Zebroneath> I'm playing 14 right now and it's a grande ole time.
[2:32:40] <+Pyroclase> As much as FFXIV is erally better, I prefer the gameplay loop in WoW a looooot
[2:32:40] <Rei_Dsoto> @PatStaresAt I JUST got Shadowbringers and am working on a Hrothgar on Famfrit.
[2:32:40] <ShinobiPhoenix> my PS4 is packed away (no room to hook it up), but I got a gaming laptop recently, so I am all kinds of exploring a new world of Steam games
[2:32:46] <vVAstrAVv> yeah larrys great
[2:32:47] <gamezerox> Game is easier when you're making it easier? Who could have guessed
[2:32:52] <shouttothevoid> I'm trying to get the chocobo but I can't stop getting sidetracked trying to do every sidequest
[2:32:52] <%Ipsenscastle> id love to play it but im worried about it absorbing my life
[2:32:53] <+LandOfTheWay> literally farming nier stuff in 14 right now
[2:32:53] <%GarbageNirvana> XIV controller support is super intuitive
[2:32:55] <vVAstrAVv> zeplas p good too
[2:32:58] <+cham52> I've honestly tried FF14 only because it's control scheme is so comfy on controller
[2:33:00] <aeonicvector> or just play Arcanist so your 2/3rds of a party option wise
[2:33:04] <Tisaric> You don't HAVE to use Steam though is what we're saying
[2:33:04] <$RealThiele> the gameplay loop in wow these days is all exalted reps and AP grinds
[2:33:06] <filialpails> don't pick up health flasks if you're already full, they'll stick around
[2:33:08] <%tanarath> It's platform specific & the steam client is poorly supported
[2:33:10] <Sayie> I would play FF14 but ARR fucking sucks ass and it goes on forever
[2:33:25] <+Tomschiii> not anymore
[2:33:32] <Tisaric> In fact it's a mistake to buy it on Steam now
[2:33:33] <DawnsRoyal> @ShinobiPhoenix just google the ff14 free trial and download it then, the steam version is generally not recommended for ff14 anyway
[2:33:33] <%GarbageNirvana> @shouttothevoid Save those for your subclass
[2:33:34] <%afronooch> they recently shortened ARR
[2:33:37] <+CrimsonDio11> @Sayie you could buy a skip then
[2:33:37] <%GalacticaPhanto> @sayie it got somewhat of a rework
[2:33:50] <vVAstrAVv> arr got nerfed actually
[2:33:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> wait so is the wall not in the city
[2:33:57] <$RealThiele> ARR if you are ok skipping cutscenes can be crushed out in a day if you are a dps
[2:34:00] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Squeenix won't let me play ff14 cos they locked an unknown email to my account and won't let me change it, so am totally locked out of even trying the game
[2:34:00] <Sayie> @GalacticaPhanto I know, I even tried it after that
[2:34:05] <%LiquidDinosaur> is it more like The Black Gate in Lotr?
[2:34:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> is Kid talion
[2:34:15] <SaltyAzteca> No man on Caelondia could EVER make it fall!
[2:34:23] <+cham52> yeah but more poins tho
[2:34:41] <penitentpentwitch> TBF, you get bonus exp and money when you have the gods on in here. So it's a choice for grinding, at least.
[2:34:43] <%TheFabledAble> If you want simple and powerful try Warrior or Black Mage or White Mage. If you enjoy comboing abilities and being flashy try Dark Knight, Astrologian, Ninja, or summoner
[2:34:52] <ShinobiPhoenix> why is Steam not recommended?
[2:34:52] <%Hasmeister96> Well TBF it's like Frank in Punisher MAX, in which it's implied he was always kinda a vicious murderer and that his family was an excuse
[2:34:59] <gamezerox> shotgun doesn't do much damage at range or close too
[2:35:02] <Psyramics> @OverzealousEuthanasiast so make a new account on a different email
[2:35:04] <$RealThiele> the marshalls now trust you to be a part of their cadet program
[2:35:05] <Vashido22> did you guys know that Steam fucked up and Vegas Pro 18 edit was being sold at like 0,19 usd in Argentina?
[2:35:08] <Vashido22> it was fun
[2:35:29] <Tisaric> @ShinobiPhoenix It's an outdated listing that essentially just gives you a 30 day sub, you can play it completely free by downloading it direct
[2:35:32] <vVAstrAVv> black mage is king
[2:35:33] <%GarbageNirvana> Hah ,nice
[2:35:37] <$RealThiele> also FF14 black mage is amazing class fantasy, big KABOOM
[2:35:44] <DawnsRoyal> @ShinobiPhoenix steam is a seperate version from windows, so you have to make all transactions through steam and can never buy a physical edition of the game if you ever wanted to
[2:35:46] <%Hasmeister96> Is vegas pro even good?
[2:36:05] <Vashido22> idk, but it was stupid cheap
[2:36:08] <%GarbageNirvana> Some folks like it
[2:36:09] <Tisaric> Also yeah you have to do everything through steam if you want to buy stuff in game
[2:36:12] <Vashido22> since they messed up
[2:36:18] <%CzeekyPlays> I've been using the Lodestone/Mogstation for all transactions since buying the game on steam...
[2:36:26] <penitentpentwitch> There are parts of the floor that don't fall even if hit by the big guys, but the ones that collapse when the turret dies are going to go no matter what.
[2:36:27] <$RealThiele> Mogstation works
[2:36:33] <%CzeekyPlays> Works for me 4head
[2:36:34] <Vashido22> like, its usually 300 dollars
[2:36:41] <Vashido22> but for 0,18? lets go
[2:36:53] <SaltyAzteca> ZA WARUDO
[2:36:58] <Zebroneath> wow
[2:37:00] <penitentpentwitch> Cheese is go
[2:37:06] <$RealThiele> three stooges syndrome
[2:37:18] <%Hasmeister96> estus to the left
[2:37:24] <%Fooguwu> oh no it's the black evil!
[2:37:26] <%LiquidDinosaur> @RealThiele that sounds like a terrible illness
[2:37:31] <ShinobiPhoenix> I don;t even remember what class I tried when I downloaded the trial on PS4 and I remember getting bored because it was tutorializing me to death and I just wanted to get on with it. After watching Pat so much (plus Nier Automata), I decided to give it another shot. Everyone said it just takes a while to get going.
[2:37:44] <$RealThiele> it makes you invincicle!
[2:38:02] <Vashido22> ye
[2:38:04] <Vashido22> SourPls
[2:38:11] <Tisaric> again that's pretty common for an MMO, early game usually sucks ass
[2:38:14] <ShinobiPhoenix> plus, when i played, it didn't have traditional classes at first... did they change that?
[2:38:21] <Lophostrix_> man the music in this game slaps
[2:38:21] <%Garthunox> @shinobiphoenix what server do you play on
[2:38:22] <Vashido22> its crazy that Hades uses the same engine at this game
[2:38:23] <+hakma> @ShinobiPhoenix bro just wait till epsidoe 15000
[2:38:31] <ShinobiPhoenix> it might NOT have been Realm Reborn!
[2:38:32] <%CzeekyPlays> "traditional"?
[2:38:34] <Jack_DT> hey Pat, have you played New World?
[2:38:37] <penitentpentwitch> Gravity 13, Pat 1
[2:38:38] <%tanarath> They recently revamped ARR & the first expansion
[2:38:43] <%GarbageNirvana> I've been playing through a new character on XIV myself and it feels like stuff has been streamlined a bit
[2:38:49] <DawnsRoyal> you promote your classes to the "traditional" jobs at lvl 30 for the base classes
[2:38:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> Sir Isaac Newton was the deadliest son of a bitch in space
[2:38:52] <Tisaric> that's true they did revamp it
[2:38:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> is*
[2:39:05] <Vashido22> PogChamp
[2:39:05] <Tisaric> but still early game MMOs are just training for your classes
[2:39:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> ........LOOKS AT CAMERA
[2:39:07] <%tanarath> You don't need to grind anymore in ARR initially.
[2:39:10] <penitentpentwitch> Ominous overtones~
[2:39:18] <%GarbageNirvana> You're still gonna get tutorials but it's mostly popup windows
[2:39:19] <DawnsRoyal> with the arr revamp if you only do the main stuff and skip most side content they cut out about 10-12 hours out of the arr slog
[2:39:25] <Rei_Dsoto> Deed eet
[2:39:27] <+cham52> You have accomplished it
[2:39:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> Sup Orb Chan?
[2:39:36] <%CzeekyPlays> Just go to Crystal and enjoy the Road to 70 +100% exp buff Kappa
[2:39:38] <Jack_DT> once the New World Beta is done I'm gonna hop on New World
[2:39:39] <gamezerox> Now do it again with all idols
[2:39:53] <penitentpentwitch> Bastion Bourbon! More estus!
[2:39:53] <Tisaric> I need to give the new ARR stuff a shot, I bounced off it hard myself
[2:39:55] <Jack_DT> I mean FFIVX
[2:39:55] <ShinobiPhoenix> I still have no idea what class to get now... I thought about Astrologian or Dark Knight or Machinist now that it apparently doesn't suck
[2:40:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Jack_DT wait what is New World's deal
[2:40:14] <vVAstrAVv> drk
[2:40:19] <waltzqueen> you did dit
[2:40:21] <BallerSwagBro9k> DEEP SOUTH NARRATOR
[2:40:23] <Psyramics> all of those classes you have to be 50 to even unlock
[2:40:26] <%SWFanatic> psaDogchamp psaHoldon
[2:40:27] <%coreyyotto> oh boy this one
[2:40:29] <%CzeekyPlays> @ShinobiPhoenix I would worry more about what role you like most first
[2:40:30] <vVAstrAVv> dark knights job quests are besr in the game
[2:40:31] <DawnsRoyal> @ShinobiPhoenix all those 3 classes are kinda locked you'd have to get to 50+ and hit heavensward first to unlock them
[2:40:35] <Vashido22> welp
[2:40:36] <ShinobiPhoenix> I loved Edgar in FF6, so I figured that would be really familiar to me
[2:40:40] <Tisaric> I love this one
[2:40:45] <SaltyAzteca> Oh I hated this one
[2:40:46] <ergulor> this one was tedious
[2:40:47] <%DedlokPM> rooBonk
[2:40:48] <penitentpentwitch> Small items can be destroyed via rolling
[2:40:48] <Tisaric> this is such a fun challenge for the hammer
[2:40:49] <%Garthunox> @shinobiphoenix you cant play any of those until you get to Heavensward
[2:40:51] <Zebroneath> Prefer the Carbine over the Bow, but the Bow is still solid.
[2:40:57] <SaltyAzteca> Trying to do the final one is a BITCH
[2:41:08] <ShinobiPhoenix> so the base classes are still there? ok, well I have no idea what to start as then
[2:41:12] <Jack_DT> @liquiddinosaur New World has a closed alpha that ends tomorrow
[2:41:17] <LoneFonte> SourPls
[2:41:17] <Vashido22> SourPls
[2:41:31] <Psyramics> I'm leveling a lancer now and its pretty simple
[2:41:41] <DawnsRoyal> @ShinobiPhoenix check out larryzaur on youtube with his what class to play in ff14 video that should help
[2:41:43] <Psyramics> if you wanna go MCH, then Archer is the same archetype
[2:41:48] <%coreyyotto> just 100
[2:41:52] <%CalderGaming> it's Time To 100
[2:41:53] <%fairore> how the game so far chat
[2:41:53] <Vashido22> you got all of them
[2:41:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Jack_DT no like, what is the game
[2:41:56] <Vashido22> its about time
[2:42:04] <%SolidusRex> LET'S PLOT A COURSE, INTERCOURSE
[2:42:04] <penitentpentwitch> This one can be a bit rough, more practice than anything
[2:42:06] <+ConLin_Arts_> psaDogchamp
[2:42:06] <+buttdirt> when do you get to beat up a toyota car as quickly as possible like in street fighter?
[2:42:09] <Jack_DT> it's a MMO
[2:42:12] <%GalacticaPhanto> you missed one
[2:42:15] <Tisaric> Bastion is still amazing
[2:42:20] <ShinobiPhoenix> I am cool being heal/support bitch, but I do like a class that can solo well enough (take hits, stay alive, heal themselvse). I like Paladins type classes a lot
[2:42:28] <Vashido22> still a great game
[2:42:36] <%Garthunox> Shinobi, what would you like to do, Tank Heal or DPS
[2:42:45] <ShinobiPhoenix> at least from what I play in games like Diablo or PSO
[2:42:46] <Psyramics> that starts as a Gladiator then, but you dont get heals until later
[2:42:46] <+firmlygraspi1> walking diagonal with the keyboard feels so bad
[2:42:52] <%CzeekyPlays> All the classes can solo well enough I think
[2:43:00] <vVAstrAVv> well youre lucky paladin is in the gamw
[2:43:09] <%Thatghostpepper> yeah MCH is a Burst dmg-type
[2:43:11] <Vashido22> rip
[2:43:14] <%Garthunox> Well you wont be able to solo anything
[2:43:17] <penitentpentwitch> Gravity 14, Pat 1
[2:43:23] <Vashido22> you need 27 seconds for the last one
[2:43:30] <DawnsRoyal> you mentioned earlier that you have a bit of anxiety when playing with other ppl, healers and tanks generally have more responsability, so maybe playing a dps first and working yourself up would be better first
[2:43:30] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean tanks can solo pretty well, you're gonna have to group up eventually tho
[2:43:30] <%fairore> fairore subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[2:43:36] <SaltyAzteca> Ahhhh its all coming back to me....the pains NotLikeThis

[2:43:54] <Vashido22> LUL
[2:43:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Jack_DT that's a yikes concept
[2:43:57] <%SWFanatic> lol
[2:43:57] <heartlesshealer> OH BOY
[2:43:58] <ShinobiPhoenix> @Garthunox that's just it, from the non-MMOs I've played, I tend to do all 3. Taking Diablo for example: I played the most as Monk, who could heal herself and others, tank hits and do crazy DPS...
[2:44:05] <thewhiterice92> Add another lol
[2:44:08] <+buttdirt> el penintente
[2:44:08] <$joylent_blue> penitentpentwitch LUL
[2:44:10] <%SolidusRex> Wait, when did Pat WIN against gravity?
[2:44:11] <vVAstrAVv> pat just try gravity rush 2 where gravity can never win
[2:44:14] <ShinobiPhoenix> I don't know how to "split" that up into one thing specifically
[2:44:19] <%CzeekyPlays> I'm assuming they meant solo as in stuff outside dungeons/raids like fates and msq stuff
[2:44:21] <Vashido22> Rip
[2:44:21] <+Just_GR> Hahaha
[2:44:23] <Vashido22> 16
[2:44:23] <%coreyyotto> 16
[2:44:25] <not_twitter_rowan> Has Pat mentioned how much of Bastion he's played before?
[2:44:26] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Jack_DT can you be the Blanket Trader class to do DoTs?
[2:44:27] <%maskofmichael> 16
[2:44:28] <penitentpentwitch> Gravity 16, Pat 1
[2:44:34] <heartlesshealer> 16
[2:44:38] <%GalacticaPhanto> just start with Arcanist
[2:44:38] <%SebsSpot> swtor is pretty much the only soloable mmo i can think of
[2:44:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> I'm gonna TRY DEFYING GRAVITY
[2:44:46] <%SolidusRex> 16
[2:44:46] <%GalacticaPhanto> you get a healer and dps in one go
[2:44:48] <%GarbageNirvana> Ranged DPS is probably the lowest stress thing you can play at first
[2:44:48] <%CzeekyPlays> The roles in ffxiv group content are very rigid
[2:44:49] <%BinaryFireball> so why did pat get a 1? @penitentpentwitch
[2:44:50] <ShinobiPhoenix> is there like a silly MMO test I can take?
[2:44:50] <+Just_GR> What's the 1 from @penitentpentwitch
[2:45:06] <Lophostrix_> close
[2:45:06] <%Jaxnos> LUL
[2:45:07] <penitentpentwitch> If there was Ever a game to do a Gravity counter on, it's this one
[2:45:11] <%Garthunox> @shinobiphoenix do you have discord? and what server do you play on?
[2:45:11] <%coreyyotto> need to do a perfect circle, can't miss anything
[2:45:14] <heartlesshealer> that's what you get for skipping sections
[2:45:14] <%GarbageNirvana> And yeah Arcanist lets you branch out into DPS or heal
[2:45:22] <clloudberry> Pat go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[2:45:29] <%Garthunox> @penitentpentwitch Gravity rush
[2:45:31] <SaltyAzteca> He has it

[2:45:44] <%CalderGaming> yeyeye
[2:45:46] <%SWFanatic> Are ya winnin son?
[2:45:49] <SomeAsianDood> First try Pog
[2:45:49] <DawnsRoyal> @ShinobiPhoenix with ff14 your decision isnt set in stone anyway as you can change classes on the go, just take whatever you think you will like most and change it up later if needed
[2:45:53] <+paladinstarbuster> SeemsGood SeemsGood
[2:45:55] <penitentpentwitch> @BinaryFireball @Just_GR During the bull trial, Gravity didn't let an enemy fall. Denying him the win. He still beat it anyway.
[2:46:19] <+Just_GR> I see
[2:46:25] <%tanarath> @patstaresat Did you know that there's custom dialog if you win the proving grounds on the first attempt?
[2:46:29] <heartlesshealer> time for gun
[2:46:32] <ShinobiPhoenix> OH yeah, Pat was leveling up all his classes on the same toon, wasn't he?
[2:46:34] <%GarbageNirvana> Nice thing about XIV too is if you do decide to switch up classes you get an exp boost up to your highest level
[2:46:36] <Vashido22> oh this one is fun
[2:46:38] <Lophostrix_> this one is fun
[2:46:39] <waltzqueen> congrats
[2:46:44] <waltzqueen> good job hammer!
[2:46:44] <%Garthunox> @shinobiphoenix yes he was
[2:46:58] <penitentpentwitch> Knockback cheese is go
[2:47:03] <heartlesshealer> Is gun upgraded?
[2:47:09] <+CSNG> Upgrades make this way better
[2:47:11] <Zebroneath> I think upgrades are necessary here
[2:47:14] <%Garthunox> @shinobiphoenix also what's a toon?
[2:47:16] <ShinobiPhoenix> though I still have to decide a Main... and I usually like to make that decision early based on data
[2:47:25] <%Ipsenscastle> oh muskets like WWI
[2:47:28] <DawnsRoyal> @ShinobiPhoenix yeah you can play all the classes on 1 character, ppl usually dont play more than 1 character unless its for role play purposes or playing with friends on different data centers
[2:47:29] <%Garthunox> Is that like toon town?
[2:47:32] <TheHeroAppears> the word musket has been said everyone must now tweet at woolie
[2:47:39] <%SWFanatic> Bork bokr
[2:47:43] <heartlesshealer> it's stored in his balls, paige

[2:47:49] <%BinaryFireball> motherfucker has like 20 godamn dicks
[2:47:50] <penitentpentwitch> Zangief has wooden teeth?
[2:47:51] <ShinobiPhoenix> my friends who play WoW call their characters "toons", I've seen others online that with MMOs too
[2:47:51] <%GarbageNirvana> toon is just another word for alt
[2:47:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> say again?
[2:47:54] <CyborgAV> Motherfuckers got like 20 goddamn dicks
[2:47:55] <Psyramics> @Garthunox its just slang for character
[2:47:56] <heartlesshealer> money

[2:48:15] <%Jaxnos> the scream
[2:48:15] <penitentpentwitch> Gravity 17, Pat 1
[2:48:18] <Vashido22> WHAT HAPPENED
[2:48:18] <%BinaryFireball> lol
[2:48:18] <%SWFanatic> i think that counts as another win for gravity
[2:48:20] <+chase959> nice

[2:48:22] <waltzqueen> LUL
[2:48:23] <%Hasmeister96> wait what just happened?
[2:48:24] <aeonicvector> only the most manly yelp
[2:48:24] <ShinobiPhoenix> I guess if I had to pick a role RIGHT NOW... it would probably be Tank
[2:48:25] <Vashido22> PAT NO
[2:48:26] <%GarbageNirvana> Folks on wow just call em toons cause the game's style is so cartoony
[2:48:26] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Pat scared
[2:48:26] <%Jaxnos> that yelp was louder than Gief
[2:48:27] <+chase959> that is some good stuff
[2:48:27] <jbrachob> LOL
[2:48:28] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> me
[2:48:28] <heartlesshealer> PAT
[2:48:32] <%reonome> what did i walk into
[2:48:33] <heartlesshealer> YOU SPILLED A PURPLE
[2:48:33] <%arcielardor> purple piss?
[2:48:33] <thewhiterice92> Someone call Max!
[2:48:33] <SaltyAzteca> @penitentpentwitch That counts? LUL
[2:48:34] <%tanarath> Gravity menaces him outside of the game as well.
[2:48:35] <hmhmh6532> WutFace
[2:48:35] <+buttdirt> rug really tied the room together
[2:48:35] <Vashido22> PAT
[2:48:36] <ShinobiPhoenix> I like surviving hits and protecting people
[2:48:38] <+river_city98> everybody's pissing there?
[2:48:43] <aeonicvector> lmfao face down on the floor
[2:48:43] <%SWFanatic> Pat: The dog did it
[2:48:44] <%Birdigalore> DIVORCE NOW
[2:48:45] <%phantomsleeves> it’s different when i spill
[2:48:48] <heartlesshealer> >:(
[2:48:51] <%fairore> God damit pat
[2:48:51] <clloudberry> Clever of Pat to spill that drink to disguise his piss
[2:48:56] <%Garthunox> @shinobiphoenix then you want tank
[2:48:57] <penitentpentwitch> @SaltyAzteca For the sake of comedy, absolutely
[2:49:03] <+chisos_degondra> mommy daddy stop fighting T_T
[2:49:11] <%BinaryFireball> Paige -The Queen of Pee
[2:49:13] <heartlesshealer> purple and red are the super stain colors
[2:49:32] <ShinobiPhoenix> though I admittedly prefer to throw a fireball at you, then rush in while the fireball is going toward you and start a beatdown
[2:49:33] <%AncelDeLambert> and then they kissed and made up live and we CLAPPED
[2:49:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> you can do this shit
[2:49:48] <%Garthunox> you have two choices off the bat, Maraduder, which becomes Warrior, and Gladiator, which becomes Paladin
[2:49:56] <%AncelDeLambert> ja ha you nerds are in love
[2:50:00] <%Movemeister> Whip it good
[2:50:00] <%GarbageNirvana> @shinobiphoenix Paladin would def be the way to go, they've made tanking super simple too and with the Smith you can get a primer on what to do before you even hit your first dungeon
[2:50:02] <ulcaban> God, this music
[2:50:06] <Melchior_the_Wise> Is this Raid: Shadow Legends?
[2:50:20] <penitentpentwitch> The nice thing about this challenge is it's "Shots Fires" so you can lineup your shots patiently
[2:50:22] <%Hasmeister96> !uptime
[2:50:23] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 50m.
[2:50:26] <Melchior_the_Wise> are you sure?
[2:50:30] <DawnsRoyal> red mage once you hit hw might be the way to go then, you do your magic casting, do some melee combos with your rapier, have heals and can revive ppl
[2:50:35] <%Jaxnos> well
[2:50:35] <%JD_Lars> Work inside out. It’s faster
[2:50:37] <ShinobiPhoenix> what about Dark Knight?
[2:50:40] <DawnsRoyal> its also very easy to play
[2:50:45] <%tanarath> Pat, stop auto aiming
[2:50:46] <%Buzzard42> bork
[2:50:46] <%SWFanatic> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:50:54] <%Garthunox> not available until Heavensward
[2:50:59] <ShinobiPhoenix> what about Red Mage or Dark Knight?
[2:50:59] <Melchior_the_Wise> Arf
[2:50:59] <Rei_Dsoto> Bork
[2:51:11] <Melchior_the_Wise> i am doggo
[2:51:14] <ChungusQuest> un beauque
[2:51:14] <%GarbageNirvana> RDM when you hit 50
[2:51:20] <ShinobiPhoenix> I mean what do I have to play as to get Red mage or Dark Knight?
[2:51:20] <nethervox> but you dont even need to reach hw for red mage, you just need to be lvl 50 and own stormblood at least
[2:51:23] <LoneFonte> @ShinobiPhoenix Expansion classes
[2:51:24] <Vashido22> LUL
[2:51:24] <waltzqueen> Bark!
[2:51:25] <%SolidusRex> Red Mage is available once you level another job to 50
[2:51:25] <%GarbageNirvana> The expansion jobs are weird like that
[2:51:29] <penitentpentwitch> From the center, outward?
[2:51:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> does Pat have the knockback upgrades
[2:51:35] <$ItsRatman> it is if you dont m i s s
[2:51:47] <%GarbageNirvana> Just level reqs
[2:51:51] <DawnsRoyal> @ShinobiPhoenix as whatever, you can unlock them once you hit the content of the first expansion
[2:51:54] <filialpails> so much for auto-aim
[2:51:56] <%Albadabar> knockback plus spread helps here
[2:51:59] <%Garthunox> @shinobiphoenix Red Mage you need to be lvl 50 and Dark Knight you have to have gotten to the first expansion
[2:52:01] <%arcielardor> use the wide upgrade and double knockback
[2:52:01] <Lophostrix_> there is no time limit, take your time, line up your shots
[2:52:03] <Psyramics> Any class to 50, you have to own Stormblood for Red Mage and get to Ishgard for DRK
[2:52:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> PAT GO SLOWER
[2:52:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> ITS LIKE POOL OR SOMETHING
[2:52:19] <aeonicvector> get in close, pushback is proportional to range
[2:52:20] <clloudberry> remember to get closer for more knockback
[2:52:21] <%Jaxnos> knockback decreases the further away you shoot from, huh?
[2:52:24] <%Garthunox> Theres a fourth Tank bte
[2:52:27] <%Garthunox> btw
[2:52:37] <%SolidusRex> Gunbreaker
[2:52:38] <+Nemesisnick33> i dont have a women FeelsBadMan
[2:52:38] <+buttdirt> paige is actually putin
[2:52:47] <ShinobiPhoenix> and the first expansion is Heavensward, which I can play for 10 levels then I have to subscribe?
[2:52:52] <%Garthunox> Gunbreaker, but you need to be lvl 60
[2:52:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> Wide or normal
[2:52:59] <%arcaderabbit48> What if I have a guy instead?
[2:53:00] <%GarbageNirvana> Basically
[2:53:06] <ShinobiPhoenix> or Heavensward isn't part of the trial at all?
[2:53:06] <%arcielardor> wiiiiide
[2:53:08] <%Jaxnos> looks like this is the best time for me to get food
[2:53:09] <+lethallylactic> @Nemesisnick33 They're overrated anyway. FeelsGoodMan
[2:53:09] <penitentpentwitch> Yes, you're an orb
[2:53:11] <%SolidusRex> You can do all of Heavensward's content without having to pay
[2:53:12] <Profmcstevie> Fuck she got you
[2:53:12] <DawnsRoyal> @ShinobiPhoenix no, you can do all of the content that heavensward includes
[2:53:14] <Tisaric> I think Heavensward is free to do entirely right?
[2:53:17] <%GarbageNirvana> You can clear all of HW's stuff and then after that you have to sub
[2:53:17] <%Garthunox> @shinobiphoenix Heavensward is those 10 levels
[2:53:25] <%SolidusRex> You only have to start paying to do Stormblood and beyond
[2:53:28] <%DedlokPM> @ShinobiPhoenix Heavensward is part of the trial
[2:53:29] <Tisaric> the level 60 is from Heavensward
[2:53:40] <%GarbageNirvana> It's a good chunk of gameplay
[2:53:42] <+lethallylactic> PogChamp

[2:55:06] <%KishinGrek> hey guys
[2:55:07] <DawnsRoyal> @RealThiele nah you are interpretting the last line of 5.3 all wrong
[2:55:13] <ShinobiPhoenix> ok, I understand that better now, it's like buying WoW Battle Chest and you get all the expansions until except the last two or something. or Destiny
[2:55:13] <Tisaric> you're about halfway
[2:55:17] <%KishinGrek> is that Mr. Blue?
[2:55:18] <%Garthunox> very far
[2:55:19] <%Thatghostpepper> @ShinobiPhoenix all of HW is free once you reach the end then yeah to progress the story you gotta sub/buy the expansions
[2:55:19] <penitentpentwitch> Near half?
[2:55:19] <%tanarath> 1/3?
[2:55:20] <Zebroneath> about halfway
[2:55:21] <Tisaric> You do all of the buildings 2 times
[2:55:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> Almost done with Act 1?
[2:55:24] <%arcielardor> about a third
[2:55:27] <SomeAsianDood> 10% in Kappa
[2:55:30] <$RealThiele> i was more thinki9ng about 99 being max level in final fantasy but that too
[2:55:34] <SaltyAzteca> Youre 1/3 in
[2:55:37] <akman14> Hym louder
[2:55:38] <ergulor> you're a bit below 50%
[2:55:39] <Admiral_PopnFresh> what is Gief doing?
[2:55:44] <+Nemesisnick33> why does paige not like humming?
[2:55:45] <+Just_GR> Why does she hate the humming?
[2:55:47] <SaltyAzteca> Oh THIS stage
[2:55:48] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> poor paige, this is the only good humming in all the world and she hates it
[2:55:49] <%Movemeister> Zangief is just half way through animorphing into Pat
[2:55:49] <Tisaric> @PatStaresAt you build over each building 2 times so you're about halfway through
[2:55:51] <%Agami23> its the only thing every super giant game has in common.
[2:55:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> Wait is he in the jungle now
[2:55:58] <ShinobiPhoenix> do you have to sub AND buy the expansions?
[2:56:03] <LoneFonte> oh this one
[2:56:06] <+lethallylactic> Aw yee
[2:56:07] <SaltyAzteca> Lets see how many times Pat faaaaalls!
[2:56:08] <penitentpentwitch> Good thing you have a Bow
[2:56:08] <%Garthunox> @shinobiphoenix yes
[2:56:11] <%JD_Lars> HLTB says Bastion is 6 to 9 hours
[2:56:12] <thewhiterice92> What’s Paige’s beef with humming?
[2:56:13] <%TheFabledAble> 2/3
[2:56:13] <Tisaric> @ShinobiPhoenix when you get to that point, yes
[2:56:14] <+Loinclothiclese> GO NELLY GO
[2:56:16] <%Hasmeister96> Oh I think I remember this level
[2:56:23] <%SaiyanShoto> Paige no! If you tell Pat you don’t like something he’ll double down
[2:56:27] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah, it's like a $55 commitment up front
[2:56:31] <$RealThiele> paige doesnt like a hummer
[2:56:34] <%GarbageNirvana> And then $15 a month
[2:56:43] <+lethallylactic> SourPls
[2:56:50] <%GarbageNirvana> I think you get three months free tho?
[2:56:56] <%Garthunox> @garbagenirvana It is not a 55 up front
[2:56:57] <%KishinGrek> is that Michael Madsen as the narrator?

[2:57:08] <+Just_GR> "I sense that I have made a mistake of some kind"
[2:57:10] <+Loinclothiclese> @KishinGrek what....no
[2:57:14] <%Hasmeister96> Oh I guess Pat saw that Ben 10 clip
[2:57:18] <%Garthunox> @garbagenirvana You can play free to 60
[2:57:19] <%asgard147> limesLUL
[2:57:21] <+Loinclothiclese> @KishinGrek Logan Cunningham

[2:57:40] <+Loinclothiclese> @KishinGrek they sound nothing alike lol
[2:57:49] <%Garthunox> @garbagenirvana There is no free months
[2:57:57] <Tisaric> expansions expect you to be the current max level yes
[2:58:01] <%Garthunox> The game is free up to level 60!

[2:58:45] <+LandOfTheWay> oh no, birdemic
[2:58:46] <+Nemesisnick33> i know i never made it past like 15 in FF14 that global cooldown is ass
[2:58:54] <penitentpentwitch> Rock is shiny, Bird want shiny
[2:59:04] <ShinobiPhoenix> well if I ever get that far, I totally need that Nier Automata in my veins
[2:59:04] <$RealThiele> FF14 GCD is long for sure
[2:59:10] <+PleasantLee> Helloooo? Pet store? I need the biggest bellseed you haaaave. No thats TOO big.
[2:59:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Eh, you get so many skills later in that it hardly matters
[2:59:19] <thememeticwind> It doesn't feel that long to me ;;;;
[2:59:21] <$RealThiele> if you play a ninja tho you will wish GCD was longer
[2:59:27] <Tisaric> you'll know if you want to keep playing by the time you hit 60\
[2:59:28] <%BubbaRands> "She's gonna need help with all them peckers" Kappa
[2:59:30] <thememeticwind> YEAH
[2:59:31] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Such ARROGANCE from these birds
[2:59:35] <$ItsRatman> I wish I was hot enough to seduce flamethrowers
[2:59:37] <Psyramics> most classes have a lot of stuff off the GCD, so it's less an issue later on
[2:59:39] <Tisaric> basically if you hit 60 you'll probably be sold
[2:59:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Watch your PECKING language pat
[2:59:45] <Bonbie> Machinist too, lots of double weaving/fast single weaves in there
[2:59:47] <ShinobiPhoenix> GCD?
[2:59:50] <%DappercatEsquire> plenty now that they jumped off the Lab Zero train
[2:59:51] <+Nemesisnick33> just play automata ShinobiPhoenix its like best game ever made
[2:59:53] <%Garthunox> @shinobiphoenix That's all the way at the end of Shadowbringers and you must be lvl 80
[2:59:56] <$RealThiele> Global cooldown
[3:00:02] <eldritchmouse> Strong art styles in general always age better than realistic graphics.
[3:00:04] <%GarbageNirvana> The thing about FFXIV is that the longer you play the better it gets
[3:00:07] <+lethallylactic> Weeping Nellie :(
[3:00:17] <$RealThiele> GCD is just how long you have to wait between button presses as forced by the game
[3:00:23] <ShinobiPhoenix> beat Nier Automata years ago, that's why I wanted to give 14 another shot

[3:01:11] <%Albadabar> IT'S TIME
[3:01:11] <%Garthunox> man honestly if you wanna play ff14 just for nier you're probably gonna be disappointed, cos that's like 2 raids, 1 more incoming
[3:01:12] <$apolitenoob> YES
[3:01:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> Omikron still looks good
[3:01:20] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt all of these assets are straight from photoshop If I recall, its why the game couldnt be resized I think I heard, because the assets were painted on a 1080p photoshop canvas
[3:01:20] <Vashido22> turn your volume up chat
[3:01:21] <+Tomschiii> oh yesss, here it comes

[3:01:50] <%Garthunox> no
[3:01:51] <Tisaric> oh shit it's Zia time huh?
[3:01:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> @xeros720 remember in Shadow of War where some orcs dont do their own intros, instead they have hype men orcs?
[3:01:57] <%Garthunox> monk is not a tank
[3:02:01] <GunEden> dig a hole?
[3:02:02] <$RealThiele> they have a bit of self-heal, but red mage fits that role better
[3:02:03] <DawnsRoyal> @ShinobiPhoenix not in the slightest, its a fast hitting dps
[3:02:07] <Blank9> give hotdog
[3:02:10] <+Tomschiii> the last song is still my all time fav in their games

[3:03:20] <%SWFanatic> I'll slap your shit
[3:03:22] <%Garthunox> if a tank is doing their job right you wont get hit mostly, apart from healer checks
[3:03:23] <+Tomschiii> isnt there a moment where the narrator hums this song?
[3:03:26] <%asgard147> limesMusic quiettMusic
[3:03:26] <ChungusQuest> I annoyed my coworkers with this song for YEARS

[3:04:07] <%dasmause> what a nice war song

[3:04:09] <%Garthunox> all classes are in their own way
[3:04:20] <+PaladinGreenjay> this song is so nice
[3:04:24] <%blastyoboots> This isn't a song about "working", this is a song by the natives about "screw you colonizers"~
[3:04:25] <$RealThiele> Scholar is boring to me atm
[3:04:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> oh hell yeah! proto red!
[3:04:39] <Vashido22> nicest war song ever
[3:04:43] <ShinobiPhoenix> I am most interessted in watching Pat play Transistor. I recently finally went back to it after never playing it far and that first boss seems like the CHEAPEST THING IN EXISTENCE
[3:04:46] <Tisaric> THE PANNING MUSIC TOO
[3:04:49] <Tisaric> IT'S SO FUCKING GOOD
[3:04:58] <%SolidusRex> It's more of a cold war song than a war song
[3:04:59] <%blastyoboots> The song is the most beautiful way of saying "lol keep building ur wall losers", which retroactively makes this game political
[3:05:00] <ShinobiPhoenix> I couldn't believe how unprepared I was
[3:05:04] <aeonicvector> Its such a plesant song, wonder what it means tho :)
[3:05:04] <Vashido22> this level was built around the song
[3:05:06] <Vashido22> its so GOOD
[3:05:08] <+ianabstract> go back
[3:05:12] <%iamnolionheart> Transistor is the one I see being the biggest hit or miss for people
[3:05:13] <+ianabstract> you missed the door you opened
[3:05:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Vashido22 depending on your outlook its ether a war song or a song about people coming to join the city
[3:05:22] <%shurtal> shurtal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Chalk another one up for "Influencer" Pat, I'm level 40 on my Warrior in FF14. First time I haven't ever bounced off an MMO, and i finally understand what Tank Anxiety feels like. Remember to tell the babies they're great. Paige is okay too, I guess.
[3:05:26] <%TheFabledAble> @RealThiele Have you played astro? I love the class, the weaving of GCD and instant casts feels super slick and stylish
[3:05:35] <+ianabstract> he went blind again
[3:05:38] <penitentpentwitch> Too late
[3:05:40] <+GovernmentMY> tlous2 is actually pretty good and most nerds cant actually explain why they think itd bad 😔
[3:05:41] <BettyMwwaahh> this was the game that made me go, "oh Indie games are GOOD" and ive loved SuperGiantGames ever since
[3:05:43] <+ianabstract> oh well, too late
[3:05:45] <$RealThiele> i havent tried astro, i got scared off it by peers

[3:06:31] <%blastyoboots> @doc_ock_rokc there's no point of view or ambiguity about it. The singer is one of the underground-living natives of the world, and the song is taunting the wall-building City-dwellers they were more or less at war with
[3:06:32] <penitentpentwitch> This area is a bit unforgiving in that respect
[3:06:35] <penitentpentwitch> But song tho
[3:06:38] <heartlesshealer> <3
[3:06:41] <%GarbageNirvana> You just used to have a lot more control over buffs
[3:06:47] <%Yukasmarvin> Yukasmarvin subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hello Pat and Paige, been watching you guys forever now. And I would like to thank you for the entertainment, especially in these tough times.
[3:06:49] <%iamnolionheart> I could listen to Cunningham narrate paint drying jesus fuck
[3:06:51] <$RealThiele> ok gotta focus puppets bunker time
[3:06:53] <xeroslash1> same VA as the muse in Hades
[3:06:53] <SaltyAzteca> Song was a warning
[3:06:54] <Tisaric> god it's so good
[3:06:57] <andresisant> Isn´t this the same as the muse on Hades ?
[3:06:57] <Tisaric> I still get chills
[3:07:01] <GoYaK> will @PatStaresAt play all the SuperGiant games ?
[3:07:05] <%reonome> hmm hmmm hmm hmm hmmm hmm hmm hmmmm

[3:07:11] <$joylent_blue> yes GoYaK
[3:07:13] <+Tomschiii> i still love the story of how supergiant actually came to life or how the people build the studio
[3:07:16] <Tisaric> The singer is the muse yes
[3:07:19] <LoneFonte> @GoYaK that's the idea
[3:07:20] <Tisaric> but not the same character
[3:07:23] <%GalacticaPhanto> Ashley belting her lungs out hit so hard
[3:07:24] <%arcaderabbit48> Astrologian feels bad and always has felt bad. Leveling it only to have all three healers at max, then dumping its cards in the trash where they belong
[3:07:26] <penitentpentwitch> @GoYaK Bastion, Transistor, Pyre and Hades at least
[3:07:28] <waltzqueen> Gonna build that wall up to the sky!
[3:07:30] <+lordericter> whoops
[3:07:31] <SomeAsianDood> Eurydice isn't a muse, Orpheus just calls her one
[3:07:33] <penitentpentwitch> So I think that's all of them?
[3:07:35] <GoYaK> @joylent_blue Fuck yeah I'm pumped
[3:07:37] <+Tomschiii> i wish league had also voice packs like in dota2
[3:07:38] <%blastyoboots> "Go build that wall until it's done... but then you've got nowhere to run." No city-settler is singing that one

[3:10:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> Paige is illiterate and Pat is colorblind.
[3:10:41] <%Fooguwu> the real burn is that she reads TOO MUCH and has to see words in her mind to speak them

[3:22:37] <%iamnolionheart> Yeah I remember having to aim M&K
[3:22:44] <Queen_Grimlock> i hope he did
[3:22:46] <penitentpentwitch> @ShinobiPhoenix He had chosen the perfect upgrades for it
[3:22:50] <Tisaric> @Zebroneath he's full time with Supergiant and in every game
[3:22:52] <+CSNG> Has Pat done any of the dream guantlets?
[3:22:54] <%iamnolionheart> Logan Cunningham has worked on every Supergiant game
[3:22:55] <waltzqueen> @Zebroneath i believe so but i dont remember where
[3:23:04] <%GalacticaPhanto> @zebroneath Yeah for every game after
[3:23:15] <Tisaric> Literally everyone who worked on this game including the VA/Composer are Supergiant full time employees
[3:23:16] <%DappercatEsquire> was this before kickstarter and obligatory kickstarter backer zones full of backer names
[3:23:22] <bluefooddye1> It's almost as if the interface has room for more upgrade slots Kappa
[3:23:22] <penitentpentwitch> @CSNG He has done The Kid's

[3:23:53] <Zebroneath> Really? I'd have to check who he's done, cause I don't remember where I've heard him in the others. XD

[3:24:22] <zakaraz> i've heard nothing but good reviews about bastion and i do think the design is beautiful, but isometric arpgs just dont appeal to me. additionally i find the narrator incredibly annoying - he tries to sound cool while using a forced raspy voice and never shuts up
[3:24:36] <%iamnolionheart> He's the voice of The Transistor, provides the voices for several Pyre characters, and plays Hades himself I believe?
[3:24:41] <%reonome> psa1guy
[3:24:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> A single NERD
[3:24:45] <+Tomschiii> @Zebroneath narrator, sword, voice, hades and many side npcs
[3:24:46] <+whoguru5> so we are getting fruit gummies for the bastion
[3:24:48] <+lordericter> intoxicating
[3:24:50] <Charronia> @DawnsRoyal Closest you can get is him as a Dota 2 announcer

[3:24:56] <heartlesshealer> blaze
[3:24:58] <Tisaric> @Zebroneath he's the sword in transistor, the god of the pyre universe and a couple other people, and Hades and other gods in Hades
[3:25:10] <%CappuccinoGuil> Like, Zulf ain't built for fighting, he's a scrawny boy.

[3:53:09] <%tanarath> @patstaresat Don't autoaim
[3:53:10] <gamezerox> Finish with the top one
[3:53:13] <%Razputin217> You have to hit them
[3:53:21] <%tanarath> Also charge while moving
[3:53:21] <Hydrapissed> is that the controller aim woof

[3:53:42] <$RealThiele> cool, ill have to buy new joycons. . . sigh
[3:53:43] <+PleasantLee> plan your route. melee is better than throw. the time it takes to aim and throw you could just kill an extra enemy
[3:53:52] <%laserbeaming> yeah, mouse and kb solves this one easy
[3:53:54] <%SWFanatic> And thats how my story ended
[3:53:57] <Hydrapissed> can just sprint threw and explode to I guess lol

[4:04:53] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt What do you respect more? A dev that clawed themselves out of making shitty games and makes good games, or a dev that has always been making good games?

[4:07:56] <%arcaderabbit48> WAR is fun. Big Cleaves go brrrrr
[4:07:58] <theobble> tank anxiety? isn't that a reddit buzzword?
