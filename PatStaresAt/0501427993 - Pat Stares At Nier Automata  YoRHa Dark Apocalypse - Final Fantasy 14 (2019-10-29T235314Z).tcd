[0:11:44] <$Big_King_Coconut> literal garbage chocolate
[0:11:45] <%Agami23> twix sucks, but resses holy shit
[0:11:45] <+primax104> really -_-
[0:11:47] <%skizzuto> twix suck, reese's and hershey's are where it's at
[0:11:48] <Monkeyweed21> hersheys is for cooking
[0:11:49] <%starotter70> Twix also sucks
[0:11:50] <%corepool> speak the truth pat
[0:11:51] <%ShineTheDiamond> Wow.... Those kids are dumb as fuck
[0:11:52] <%furiousfurioso> Hershey's is so nothing
[0:11:54] <poodo89> been running it all day, still haven't gotten the 2b outfit :/
[0:11:54] <FriendlyCheer> With almonds they're not bad
[0:11:54] <swordtosong> you're right and you should say it
[0:11:56] <%SpcOpsBear> Twix is fucking delicious
[0:11:56] <%simulationbard> I like straight chocolate tho
[0:11:59] <%Das_Bass> Das_Bass subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! hi pat
[0:12:00] <+jiggy_snipe> Hershey's is just plain ass chocolate
[0:12:00] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat would you eat it in S'mores cirNom
[0:12:01] <pectusumbra> anything besides basic hershey is fine, but twix is good.
[0:12:01] <%RubberFistFight> Hershey's chocolate tastes like puke because apparently they decided to have a higher-than-usual amount of butyric acid in it.
[0:12:02] <Dovakhin573> Resses suck
[0:12:03] <%Owkono> it will be hard to raid with tears in your eyes
[0:12:03] <SlimeSlimeSlime> They're all Twix! It was a set up!
[0:12:04] <%Lord_maxios> KitKat>>>>>>>>>everything
[0:12:05] <%starotter70> I would
[0:12:06] <cureneckbeard> Pat looks like a guy who often enjoys a Twix.
[0:12:06] <ColRedyx> Reeses behind anything D:
[0:12:07] <+primax104> I thought you'd like Hersheys coz it is pure
[0:12:07] <Twoiis> I like Coffee Crisps.
[0:12:07] <%Saltmeisterr> i like snickers
[0:12:10] <%Agami23> what about three muskateers? @AngriestPat
[0:12:11] <%miguelrod777> fuck you Reese's is great
[0:12:11] <%cvp5127> snickers can watch
[0:12:11] <%psychodave1234> id put a snickers in my ass
[0:12:13] <%Saltmeisterr> kit kats tho
[0:12:14] <Dovakhin573> candy peanut butter is the worst
[0:12:15] <pectusumbra> Personally recently I really like the white-chocolate kit-kats
[0:12:15] <shiny_prinny> yeah not a pb&choco fan, or caramel
[0:12:17] <FriendlyCheer> In the bed or in the closest?
[0:12:19] <fairore> the white chocolate pretty good
[0:12:23] <wrightlight94> how about reeses pieces
[0:12:25] <%RubberFistFight> Chocolate of other nations points and laughs at American chocolate though.
[0:12:29] <%Goobbue> I finally turned normal battle music on for the first time since completing the MSQ and oh my god it's so good
[0:12:31] <swipperswapper> hersheys is that middle ground between good chocolate and that crappy cheap easter chocolate

[0:12:55] <%shadowace2400> I HATE that the mounts were PVP based
[0:13:03] <%shadowace2400> requiring victories
[0:13:04] <Graxe_> Basically, it's given a proper fight, it's permanent.
[0:13:05] <$Big_King_Coconut> the FFXV stuff was limited time monkaS

[0:23:58] <%RubberFistFight> @theman515 I told him the other night that he could bump his bitrate up to 8k instead of 6k since twitch unofficially raised their cap that high. I agree, it looks fucking fantastic.

[0:29:28] <%Faustgesicht> This is kinda Hildebrand-y
[0:29:29] <+cicatjb> who needs arcane magics

[0:30:03] <%HiroTSK5> "It's weird, kill it"
[0:30:04] <BlacSoul> was that actually emil?
[0:30:05] <ZeroCount> Does pat hate the lala’s because he is one irl?
[0:30:07] <Pompadourius> To be fair, comedic bullshit IS still par for the course with NieR and all Yoko Taro games.
[0:30:07] <%Lord_maxios> not emil rip
[0:30:11] <+WutangchickeN> these buffoons are stepping into some horrifying existential dread right here
[0:30:11] <%Viciousg00se> when in doubt bomb everything
[0:30:12] <pectusumbra> Pat's character is huge
[0:30:15] <reonome> its yoko taro's head

[0:32:12] <%Yakobro> @Goobbue yes
[0:32:13] <%Finakala> The run I did half an hour ago had a bunch of deaths, but no wipes
[0:32:22] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Wait if 2B is 2E then is 2P actually 2F?
[0:32:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> SFV came out over 4 years ago. Really doesn't feel like it :(
[0:32:32] <%JojoPiero> 24 MAN 24m
[0:32:37] <RossMirage> @AngriestPat be wary that there's a slight issue with people not being able to leave the raid after wiping on the final boss.
[0:32:39] <Pompadourius> HYPE NEW MARKERS
[0:32:47] <%Finakala> Yeah new markers are dope
[0:32:47] <@SSaryn> Make a Fellowship that's just called UwU Kappa
[0:32:51] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat So Pat? Was Paige not going back to Chicago? I then saw she went to London but wasn't sure on updates, I don't do social media

[0:33:16] <RavenHellkite> it is cannon for ff
[0:33:21] <@SSaryn> Oh trust me, I know
[0:33:22] <RavenHellkite> canon
[0:33:24] <%Owkono> Yoko Taro's trap
[0:33:25] <%Jaxnos> is it a bug or a feature?
[0:33:27] <Pompadourius> It's gonna be canon for bothj
[0:33:33] <@StridentSong> Hey.
[0:33:33] <pectusumbra> Okay, let's recap: Pat, what did you call yesterday? 9S as boss, anything else?

[0:34:06] <RossMirage> TanB
[0:34:08] <@StridentSong> I lied. Gotcha binch!
[0:34:12] <$OmegaWeltall> oh... thanks Japan...
[0:34:14] <FriendlyCheer> Ganguro 2P
[0:34:14] <%Finakala> Copied City feels way less wipey than Rabanastre or Orbonne first day
[0:34:17] <Flarepulse> but why lighting gotta be racist like that
[0:34:18] <%Tucker0603> boooo, give me my dark gal
[0:34:18] <MasterDecoder> Chocolate 2P > this 2P
[0:34:19] <%Afterman_> i dont know if i believe that excuse
[0:34:21] <%Saltmeisterr> oh lighting
[0:34:21] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Nier canon is weird as fuck to begin with so this Xover makes sense. But even for Final Fantasy this is out there
[0:34:21] <cizal11> the lighting in every stage??? sounds like some bs
[0:34:21] <@SSaryn> evo19MindBlown
[0:34:22] <startstoprepeat> she fell out of the soul calibur portal into a puddle of bleach, this is canon
[0:34:22] <%XeroSigmaPrime> But TanB in White i hotter than this :(
[0:34:23] <UberKingKai> Ahhh
[0:34:24] <%NWR_James> HAPPY PATCH DAY!
[0:34:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @ThePuddingDead She doesn't technically live under Pat's address. She moved back from Japan to her home in the states.
[0:34:26] <fairore> awwwww
[0:34:27] <ToneBacas> is this canonical to nier's story? OpieOP
[0:34:29] <%Finakala> Orbonne first day was a mess
[0:34:30] <%Saltmeisterr> "LIGHTING"
[0:34:32] <spacecatstreams> am i here on time for 2butt?
[0:34:36] <%Goobbue> Okay so I have next to know knowledge of nier, is 2P like a same model robot as 2B or something
[0:34:41] <Pompadourius> I wiped twice my first time and then never again
[0:34:45] <$Thatghostpepper> @tonebacas you'll see
[0:34:58] <prime_name> @Goobbue Maybe? It's not explained yet
[0:34:59] <@SSaryn> Everyone has anyway
[0:35:01] <%Ascethetic> @angriestpat does this mean that FF14 is linked with Soul Caliber?
[0:35:02] <%Fenrirlives> You haven't been collecting your Cellphones Pat?
[0:35:05] <Kongro_> The tank tomestone gear is really good looking.
[0:35:06] <%ThePuddingDead> @Sphincter_Spelunker So her mailing address is still in the states but lives under his roof then?
[0:35:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> Aw nertz. It's this guy again.
[0:35:14] <%mister___doctor> I thought that said Dog Shit Chef
[0:35:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Goobbue Maybe? Since 2B isnt actuall a B model, so 2P might not be a P model...
[0:35:19] <PkSilent01> is there layered armor?
[0:35:22] <Pompadourius> @Goobbue We don't know yet what the "P" stands for since the letters are all different designations.
[0:35:26] <%Fidranth> @AngriestPat CSB fellowship?
[0:35:27] <%Tucker0603> @angriestpat the alexandrian fending set is sick
[0:35:29] <Sapphire_Breeze> So Geralt can appear in FF14
[0:35:31] <DexteraXIII> So it's also linked with Star Wars, then?
[0:35:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Ascethetic Every game is linked with Soul Caliber
[0:35:33] <TheBlankAce> FF14 is linked to Star Wars too now
[0:35:34] <%miguelrod777> geralt can visit ff 14
[0:35:35] <reonome> it was already linked because of geralt
[0:35:35] <%SpcOpsBear> This also means that Final Fantasy is linked with Assassin's Creed TWICE.
[0:35:36] <+Estuko> @Goobbue 2P originated from Soul Calibur where 2B was the initial player and 2P was "Player 2" character. But people liked her because she's hot. Lore wise? I dunno
[0:35:37] <%cylish> Soul edge for DRKs!
[0:35:37] <$Thatghostpepper> @pksilent01 yes
[0:35:38] <Sol_Install> so what is she? a 2F
[0:35:43] <%LaughingCatt> We are now 1 degree closer to an FF Witcher crossover
[0:35:44] <cureneckbeard> the P stands for Pat
[0:35:46] <Trash_leviathan> ff14 is link to zelda
[0:35:47] <%Goobbue> I think I'm even more confused than before I asked lol
[0:35:47] <%Ascethetic> @rumtumtugnutz u rite
[0:35:48] <cureneckbeard> 2 Pat
[0:35:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @ThePuddingDead Something like that. Ever hear the Marnie story? Kinda explains her living situation
[0:35:51] <@SSaryn> @pksilent01 It has Transmog, yes.
[0:35:56] <%SpcOpsBear> Once by way of being linked to Soul Calibur, and once by actually being in FF15.
[0:36:00] <UberKingKai> Final fantasy 14 is connected to teller confirmed
[0:36:01] <Enemy_In_Disguise> All JRPGs exist in the same universe, clearly
[0:36:03] <reonome> 2Paige
[0:36:04] <+primax104> To Pat or not to Pat
[0:36:05] <%Finakala> 2Patron
[0:36:07] <@SSaryn> The P is stored in the balls Kappa
[0:36:08] <primax104> that is the question
[0:36:09] <filialpails> 2 pat 2 furious
[0:36:09] <UberKingKai> *tekken
[0:36:12] <%Fenrirlives> so if you put two Pats together you get a sexy Android?
[0:36:12] <prime_name> 2Primal
[0:36:15] <%corepool> 2 pat or not 2 pat
[0:36:15] <Flarepulse> tekken
[0:36:17] <Covil91> So this factory has just been in a valley for 100+ years. And nobody knew it.
[0:36:20] <cisealnine> I thought it was penis that the P stood for.
[0:36:21] <+primax104> LINK
[0:36:22] <%hycind53> Hildibrand in Tekken when
[0:36:23] <%HiroTSK5> "Copied Factory" like the Copied City I guess?
[0:36:24] <M4eta> and yoda
[0:36:24] <Flarepulse> and Yoda
[0:36:28] <Dementedpenguin> So Nier exists in the Walking Dead universe, you say?
[0:36:30] <reonome> and link
[0:36:31] <%vaporousTippler> Noctis and Lars are fishing buddies.
[0:36:33] <$serpenttucker> @AngriestPat FF14 is in the same universe as the walking dead
[0:36:33] <Monkeyweed21> FF14 IS CANON IN SMASH
[0:36:33] <thwak> and spawn
[0:36:34] <StaticSunrise> does that mean 14 is a fighting game?
[0:36:34] <%floodtalon> Yoda is canon to Final Fantasy
[0:36:34] <+primax104> and ryu knows spiderman
[0:36:35] <%AdmiralButtloaf> and smash
[0:36:35] <Sol_Install> yoda and link
[0:36:35] <PkSilent01> and Cloud is in smash
[0:36:36] <%mister___doctor> And Ryu was in Smash
[0:36:37] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL Noctis isnt a final fantasy character though, his game doesnt count
[0:36:37] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> ryu was in granblue too
[0:36:38] <%averyoddjew> and geralt was in soul calibur 6
[0:36:38] <DexteraXIII> And The Legend of Zelda!
[0:36:40] <Scorpion12590> So does that mean that 2B is just 2 boivin
[0:36:41] <BlacSoul> TOO MANY CONNECTIONMS
[0:36:41] <+Lost_Zombie> So what you're saying is FFXIV is a fighting game
[0:36:41] <%cvp5127> pat dont
[0:36:41] <%averyoddjew> and monster hunter
[0:36:41] <%Finakala> To be fair the factory seems to have been underground and wasn't found until someone moved AN ENTIRE MOUNTAIN
[0:36:42] <%HiroTSK5> Link is in Souls Caliber
[0:36:42] <+Ominnous> yes correct
[0:36:43] <Mr_Strut> So Phoenix Wright confirmed for FF 14?
[0:36:44] <+primax104> So Spiderman is in Nier
[0:36:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> I mean, Soul Caliber is at least in-canon linked with most Fighting Games, and Final Fantasy has a fighting game.
[0:36:45] <%Goobbue> Every video game ever just takes place in the same universe now pretty much
[0:36:46] <mayorrev> HE DID A SHIN SHORYU
[0:36:47] <%Owkono> pat and paige combined is 2P
[0:36:47] <lordsdb> Devil Jin got into SoulCal by costuume, and move set it counts!
[0:36:47] <+VoytekBus> and Marty McFly
[0:36:47] <suikudo> Ryu is fighting rathalos irght now in Teppen
[0:36:47] <Pompadourius> The moment you have Noctis connected to Tekken it all goes to shit, since that opens up LITERALLY ALL OF PROJECT X ZONE
[0:36:48] <M4eta> and link
[0:36:48] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat also, link yoda darth vader and star killer
[0:36:50] <%Ascethetic> Y'shtola for Smash
[0:36:52] <mercado94> And cloud is in kh
[0:36:53] <KazMkII> Snake fought Rath too
[0:36:53] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat EVERYTHING is connected!
[0:36:54] <RavenHellkite> sneak fought rathalos too
[0:36:55] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Ryu is a Power Ranger
[0:36:55] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat Also Akuma was sent to kill Heihachi
[0:36:56] <$OmegaWeltall> Asura Wrath Crossover Confirmed TheIlluminati
[0:36:57] <%Fatmanjoggin> dmc and ff are connected confirmed
[0:36:58] <%Jaxnos> ryu fought rathalos twice, in monhun and smach
[0:37:00] <%miguelrod777> Akuma was in Tekken so Street fighter is Canon to ff 14
[0:37:02] <UberKingKai> Too much
[0:37:04] <+Ominnous> and Wesker fought Rathalos in Teppen so Resident evil is part of Final Fantasy
[0:37:04] <%Fidranth> when is the yakuza crossover
[0:37:06] <artoflec> Noctis goes fishing with Lars or whatever
[0:37:07] <+cicatjb> nothing beats darth vader holding the soul calibur and soul edge like a putts
[0:37:07] <@SSaryn> oof
[0:37:08] <Kongro_> lets not go down this road chat
[0:37:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> So by THAT route, Everything is connected to Soul Caliber.
[0:37:10] <veldinmusic> E S P O R T S
[0:37:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Modern SNL. hoo boy
[0:37:13] <%Chichen> sbfpSetIn
[0:37:14] <DexteraXIII> Dramadey
[0:37:17] <%Goobbue> I think if a FFXIV character got into Smash, Alphinaud as like a pet character would be fun
[0:37:18] <Flarepulse> CHUCK LORRE PRESENTS
[0:37:18] <%mister___doctor> More like REE sports amight boys
[0:37:21] <Monkeyweed21> just put LTG in front of a camera
[0:37:21] <+primax104> TeeVee
[0:37:21] <BlacSoul> Worst timeline
[0:37:23] <%DocSigma> an esports porno when
[0:37:25] <startstoprepeat> zero thuggery
[0:37:25] <+WutangchickeN> one time Mac and Me fought KOS-MOS in Chun lis stage
[0:37:25] <%skizzuto> esports sitcom is the most cursed thing I've ever heard of
[0:37:30] <grayjammer> dramedy... eughhhhh
[0:37:30] <+primax104> 30 year old boomers
[0:37:31] <+Merkensteiner> Hack Frauds?
[0:37:31] <Pompadourius> THIS IS LOW
[0:37:32] <WillofGame> Do you think it would be possible for FF14 to crossover with The Witcher?
[0:37:32] <TheBlankAce> From the producers of the big bang theory!
[0:37:33] <%Owkono> Daddy of Light
[0:37:36] <Trash_leviathan> ryu is in smash, smash has joker persona shares the same universe as smt somehow and smt has dante so 2b and dante exist in the same universe
[0:37:37] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat Ryu has fought Rathalos at LEAST 3 times at this point in entirely separate videogames right?
[0:37:38] <Pompadourius> TIER
[0:37:40] <BlacSoul> SANITIZED
[0:37:42] <Pompadourius> GAWWWWWWWWWWD
[0:37:43] <fairore> oohhh God

[0:37:46] <M4eta> Can't wait for D&D to direct it

[0:41:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> FUCK YEA
[0:41:52] <devanmuse> god, this raid STARTS with Song of the Ancients?
[0:41:52] <%Tucker0603> as someone who has never played automata I'm confused but amazed
[0:41:53] <%GarbageNirvana> We're gonna have to get a theme park level in this raid, right, there's no way we wouldn't
[0:41:54] <ThirdPersonPhil> ooh yes what the Nier OST needed all this time, alot of generic mmo noise on top of it
[0:41:54] <gekizenbu> RIP
[0:41:56] <%ThePuddingDead> i cant believe they start with THAT
[0:41:56] <%Finakala> Yeah I noticed the music was quiet in my run through
[0:41:56] <Basch71> better being a tank than anyone else in this situation LuL
[0:41:58] <%gespenst25> D-danmaku da!
[0:41:58] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Dem be Nier ball alright!
[0:41:58] <reonome> which version is this
[0:42:00] <RavenHellkite> volume on the music is pretty low
[0:42:06] <Dhurkst> @Tucker0603 It's a freaking journey
[0:42:06] <%AdmiralButtloaf> warning fights are for real
[0:42:07] <reonome> oh, automata
[0:42:08] <%shadowace2400> DAMMIT, I want to watch this but SPOILERS dammit
[0:42:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PkSilent01 They could've done the classic, "Just talk." I'd say that's a wrong
[0:42:12] <%ThePuddingDead> oh not the original
[0:42:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> This murder slinky is a rather uninspired boss design.
[0:42:15] <%Quietshun13> @ThirdPersonPhil :/
[0:42:15] <%ThePuddingDead> still a great track
[0:42:17] <ScreamLord> Song of the Ancients and Kaine's Salvation are the BEST songs in Nier
[0:42:18] <%DraxTD> Pat Sings Twitch
[0:42:19] <%Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[0:42:22] <$serpenttucker> Boy what very appropriate music Kappa

[0:42:31] <+WutangchickeN> ooh it's that song Defense of the Ancients
[0:42:33] <%RubberFistFight> @ScreamLord [Detecting] Hmmm, I see no lies here.
[0:42:34] <pectusumbra> I do hope we get carnival music at least once in this
[0:42:38] <Basch71> its doomvoid guillotine
[0:42:43] <Nina96> this is a new machine design right?
[0:42:45] <$KnivesEve> is this the original or the one in automata?
[0:42:48] <reiju_22> is there a ffxiv remix of the nier soundtracks?
[0:42:49] <%gespenst25> I STILL don't know how to deal with this mechanic.
[0:42:49] <%Finakala> Yeah it's a new design
[0:42:55] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Popa and Deva giving us their vocal nostalgia trip

[0:43:33] <%animalxer> So what's the story so far?
[0:43:37] <+ThatOneGameTester> i can't wait to be back on Bell internet. a sentance i didn't thin ki would say
[0:43:45] <Pompadourius> @animalxer Blow up wall, enter NieR World
[0:43:46] <$Carbonwater> SourPls
[0:43:48] <%Owkono> need to see that gear
[0:43:53] <$Cattadope> this raid is making me want to play this but i have no fucking idea what im looking at
[0:44:01] <%GarbageNirvana> An alliance raid that ain't braindead, imagine that
[0:44:07] <%gespenst25> @Asuxley it's a remix of Song of the Ancients. It's the Nier automata version that plays during the first boss
[0:44:09] <morningmoondude> when you boil it down, isn't "we walked in" the story of Nier 1 and 2?
[0:44:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Cattadope same my guy
[0:44:11] <cizal11> @AngriestPat please turn the music volume up next time you get a chance. the patch lowered volume across the board
[0:44:13] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Do you have to be the raid multiple times for different endings?
[0:44:14] <%Fidranth> I see Gunbreaker Luffy
[0:44:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> Does this mean now that Drakengard was a Final Fantasy all along?
[0:44:14] <$Thatghostpepper> @animalxer exploring atm
[0:44:16] <%Finakala> FFXIV and NieR are two of the best games of the 2010s tbf
[0:44:19] <DawnsRoyal> @Cattadope do it, if you start now you can do this raid in about 2 months :D
[0:44:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> Luffy should be a monk, not a gunbreaker.
[0:44:41] <+Armeggadon> You should definitely turn up the music. It's so good
[0:44:43] <Pompadourius> @Jack_of_No_Trades There's already a choice at the end that says you can only progress the storyline in one way, so no joke, maybe.
[0:44:44] <Asuxley> @gespenst25 I see
[0:44:53] <%Zepik> those good ol' Canadian Tank Swaps
[0:44:56] <SlimeSlimeSlime> I was first introduced to Nier by the SBF's Let's Play and dove DEEP into it afterwards. Thanks for the introduction to a great world, Pat!
[0:44:59] <Pompadourius> Or, a choice between two different quests rathre.
[0:45:01] <FriendlyCheer> dont be under em
[0:45:01] <cizal11> this one is bigger than before
[0:45:04] <$Cattadope> @DawnsRoyal ive been toying with the idea of starting it, just intimidated lol
[0:45:06] <%CalderGaming> FOUR YEARS
[0:45:09] <ScreamLord> Here is the story so far: Pat and 2 midgets blew up some robots and met Photo Negative 2B and then the 2 midgets blew up a door and then Pat walked in
[0:45:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> Hit the thing with the sharp part.
[0:45:11] <Nina96> i cant hear the song Pat sing louder
[0:45:12] <%Valdorick> There ya go
[0:45:13] <californaya> just dodge?
[0:45:14] <%gespenst25> @Asuxley Song of the Ancients - Atonement it's called
[0:45:17] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> pat sing louder!
[0:45:20] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> @Pompadourius Oh wow that is pretty neat! I was trying to think what cool details they could include
[0:45:23] <%starotter70> That's usually a good start
[0:45:24] <%GarbageNirvana> Don't get hit by the death orbs, how about that
[0:45:26] <%gespenst25> I think that is this version
[0:45:36] <%Jaxnos> oh hey, that move
[0:45:40] <%Valdorick> Oof Group B
[0:45:41] <Pompadourius> This is indeed the Automata version of Song of the Ancients.
[0:45:41] <Mendin> That was cute
[0:45:43] <DawnsRoyal> @Cattadope really no need to be intimidated, the community in this game is great, and it really eases you into it, by the time you hit hard content, you'll be ready
[0:45:45] <cizal11> lmfao
[0:45:48] <thwak> RIP alliance B
[0:45:52] <%GarbageNirvana> Group Based
[0:45:53] <tearsaurther> @angriestpat could you turn the volume up, the music is beautiful
[0:45:54] <%gespenst25> Get used to that, seeing one alliance completly dead
[0:45:54] <%Yakobro> it's always alliance B
[0:45:58] <%floodtalon> Rip Alliance C
[0:45:59] <+primax104> one of the best
[0:46:01] <%starotter70> This song is what introduced me to the series
[0:46:04] <%RubberFistFight> Holy shit this music is the best
[0:46:11] <Pompadourius> One does not simply adjust settings in the middle of a raid fight.
[0:46:13] <%RubberFistFight> doesn't matter how many times i hear it
[0:46:16] <%DarknessD42> Nice
[0:46:16] <+D00msDayDan> this is gonna be a hell of a raid if they're opening with song of atonement
[0:46:17] <%RubberFistFight> it's always the fucking best
[0:46:21] <devanmuse> watch this raid suddenly go into NiER classic territory. Final Boss: The Shadowlord
[0:46:23] <%Finakala> B is always most consistent for me, A is the one that always dies
[0:46:24] <californaya> how the hell does this work with 3 groups, is everyone just in their own instance but also in the same battle
[0:46:27] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> DONT JINX IT
[0:46:33] <%cylish> Screw everyone sitting in a huge mount blocking the door
[0:46:35] <FriendlyCheer> doing easier!
[0:46:35] <DexteraXIII> HERE WE GO CRAZY TALK
[0:46:38] <reiju_22> SourPls
[0:46:42] <%gespenst25> Your WHM has had all their MP eaten tho
[0:46:43] <Nina96> holy shit group B
[0:46:43] <%caffeinomancer> apatCrazy apatCrazy apatCrazy apatCrazy
[0:46:49] <+HelloImTom08> the Raid wasn't as hard as Rab day one
[0:46:50] <%Owkono> best opening ever
[0:46:52] <%Quietshun13> @californaya nope all in the same plave
[0:46:53] <Pompadourius> @californaya Everyone is just playing but you can only see all the exact stats in your own party. You can still interact with the rest though, and the chat is shared between all.
[0:47:01] <%Finakala> It's ALWAYS A dying for me
[0:47:04] <%Gigmunch> kinda wanna re sub just for this music shit
[0:47:07] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Bless us with louder music Lava Man
[0:47:08] <+metalsiren31> Except when it's C
[0:47:10] <%gespenst25> In this raid you can go from having enough free time to raise the other groups to just heckin dead. It's wild.
[0:47:19] <Lagzlot> When I did this the tank held the boss in a corner. Big mistake when the whole raid got Sloppy'd by balls.
[0:47:23] <Pompadourius> I'm always in group B but since I'm a tank I carry my parties to victory. ;)
[0:47:24] <%ThePuddingDead> i'd lose my shit if ur auto attacks took out the orbs
[0:47:28] <%augusm> Wait there was an update??
[0:47:34] <Basch71> that hit so fucking hard
[0:47:35] <%augusm> Fuck I'm out ofthe loop
[0:47:37] <%skizzuto> okay how much worse is the bullet hell bullshit gonna get by the end of this raid
[0:47:37] <%Finakala> 5.1 today
[0:47:41] <Pompadourius> This is day 1 of patch 5.1 yeah
[0:47:50] <Ultimatefool> LB3 on first boss wow'
[0:47:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> QAuit pulling your devil trigger and pay attention!
[0:47:56] <$Cattadope> @DawnsRoyal might just have to try it, thanks fren :)
[0:47:57] <%augusm> Well shit guess I better log on
[0:48:05] <ColRedyx> Honestly I wish there was more bullet hell for the authentic Nier experience.
[0:48:09] <gekizenbu> try not to get bombed again
[0:48:13] <Sokumotanaka> Imagine 2B finding out here humans exist and suddenly a fucking catman walks by and other weird races too and she just malfunctions 2B>>>NotLikeThis
[0:48:15] <%Valdorick> apatCrazy can't tank if you dead
[0:48:19] <%Finakala> New story, new dungeon, new 24man, new beast tribe, crafting rework
[0:48:24] <+HelloImTom08> voke on CD, establish ur dominance Pat
[0:48:24] <Pompadourius> @ColRedyx There's more bullet hell
[0:48:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @rumtumtugnutz but it's getting bigger. my frustration, that is
[0:48:27] <FriendlyCheer> ouch those other alliances
[0:48:28] <%Owkono> you mean the dps tank
[0:48:31] <FriendlyCheer> this could be rough
[0:48:33] <%ThePuddingDead> I HEARD THAT
[0:48:34] <+LiveStreamOnyx> @colredyx oh trust there is
[0:48:35] <Nina96> oof C
[0:48:36] <Mendin> It's not a corridor, it's an inner and an outer track
[0:48:37] <%Yakobro> THE BOX NOISE
[0:48:38] <+Edrem> so many dead, this groups are gonna struggle LUL
[0:48:39] <%skizzuto> that loot sound effect!
[0:48:42] <Dwarven_Gaming> listen to how the chests open!
[0:48:44] <gekizenbu> tiny baby booties
[0:48:46] <Dwarven_Gaming> its the sdound effects!
[0:48:47] <ColRedyx> I already did the raid, there's not that much.
[0:48:48] <%ThePuddingDead> yo the amount of detail they show in this
[0:48:49] <Dhurkst> Pat's paper doll looks like a monster

[0:50:31] <deadbeat34> Are the mobs....talking?
[0:50:33] <%lucidrush> Should i bother with ffxiv as a mainly solo player?
[0:50:36] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> SourPls
[0:50:42] <%tizz86> watching this makes me wanna do another playthrough of automatic tomatoes
[0:50:47] <Pompadourius> @lucidrush The game treats solo players really well since you can solo queue for everything.
[0:50:49] <clempstwitch> SUP GAMER GIRLS
[0:50:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> @lucidrush It's mostly a solo game. So yes.
[0:50:52] <Nina96> yes they prob are talking
[0:50:52] <%Goobbue> @lucidrush yeah the game is super solo friendly
[0:50:53] <%Saltmeisterr> SourPlls

[0:51:07] <@SSaryn> @lucidrush If you dont mind at least pugging dungeons and trials, then yeah its fine
[0:51:07] <%GarbageNirvana> @lucidrush The only thing you'd really struggle with is the EX/Savage content and even then you can usually pull up party finder
[0:51:09] <%AncelDeLambert> the game just isn't crafter friendly, holy fucking shit the inventory bullshit
[0:51:10] <%Saltmeisterr> hey who does the music for the Nier series?
[0:51:11] <prime_name> It be the rat king!

[0:53:04] <%Goobbue> okay I actually want to play nier a lot more now
[0:53:05] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat So how does this connect to Nier Automata exactly? It's apparently a sequel?
[0:53:06] <%skizzuto> likely named after philosopher Thomas Hobbes
[0:53:08] <Sokumotanaka> @Trash_leviathan Are we REALLY surprised glados trying kill people?
[0:53:08] <Mendin> Thomas Hobbes
[0:53:15] <+Ninetales38> We wiped 2 times on this
[0:53:15] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[0:53:18] <%Agami23> the floor wants up skirts too
[0:53:30] <Pompadourius> THAT DRK WAS INSPIRATIONAL
[0:53:38] <Dhurkst> Watch out for DEADLY NEUROTOXIN
[0:53:38] <+RandomHero562> I love this boss
[0:53:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> DANK BUSTA
[0:53:46] <DawnsRoyal> this fight actually has severly different mechanics depening on which alliance you are in
[0:53:47] <%ThePuddingDead> this is batshit....
[0:53:52] <%averyoddjew> holy shit this is nuts
[0:53:52] <%ThePuddingDead> i love it
[0:53:52] <ColRedyx> Cool detail: each group has a different floor mechanic to deal with.
[0:53:55] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat lol Moobot is still spruiking Outer Worlds :P
[0:54:00] <deadbeat34> remember these?
[0:54:09] <$serpenttucker> I really dunno how I feel about the track choices thus far.
[0:54:15] <%starotter70> oh shit
[0:54:16] <devanmuse> so the GLaDOS reference here is... entirely intentional, right? I mean, it's in the Quality Assuracne (re: TESTING) dept
[0:54:16] <+Estuko> WOAH 2P's moveset!!
[0:54:18] <Pompadourius> SIMONE
[0:54:23] <Dragon_Batman> Oooh shit the laser circles

[0:54:31] <Flarepulse> God I miss raiding
[0:54:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Whatcha think the weapons are out of this
[0:54:39] <Mendin> That was Simone's attack, right?
[0:54:42] <californaya> that means you gotta wiggle back and forth real quick
[0:54:46] <%Goobbue> FUCK I ACCIDENTALLY WENT INTO THE CUTSCENE WITH HALRIC WITH THE FROG SUIT ON
[0:54:52] <Pompadourius> There are no NieR weapons. 24 man raids don't have weapons in FFXIV. :/
[0:54:53] <$Big_King_Coconut> FIRE BAD
[0:54:56] <cizal11> lmao
[0:55:00] <BlacSoul> rip

[0:55:06] <%ThePuddingDead> thats a wipe
[0:55:08] <%starotter70> Run into the fire
[0:55:08] <%simulationbard> Move into the fire, of course
[0:55:09] <$Thatghostpepper> baked pat Kappa
[0:55:11] <%AncelDeLambert> ... how is Pat doing damage?
[0:55:12] <DawnsRoyal> @GarbageNirvana there are no weapons from here, only armour, and a full 2B outfit
[0:55:14] <%dabeaminator> Is this a Nier themed raid in FF14?
[0:55:17] <Nina96> oof
[0:55:19] <Flarepulse> yes
[0:55:19] <deadbeat34> @angriestpat yeah, this one is a bitch.
[0:55:21] <%Quietshun13> yup
[0:55:21] <%GarbageNirvana> Well shoot
[0:55:30] <californaya> you got a bunch of dead folk on your team
[0:55:30] <%Finakala> @dabeaminator Yup
[0:55:31] <+ThatOneGameTester> man just hearing this music is setting off my empathy
[0:55:36] <$The_Cassowary> So what style of unit is 2P? I mean B's are battle units so what is a P unit
[0:55:37] <ColRedyx> Hobbes just accused you of cheating.
[0:55:40] <%ThePuddingDead> oh god the floor!
[0:55:41] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> OFFENSE TAKEN
[0:55:42] <%Valdorick> It's mad you're cheating. Now it shall cheat.
[0:55:42] <Pompadourius> I did this fight first try with no wipes but boy was it a close shave at points
[0:55:46] <%Rumbutt> The machine is calling you a apatBig cheater!

[0:56:12] <Mendin> Oh hey those lightning emitters in the floor are also stubby heads
[0:56:16] <$Big_King_Coconut> the conveyor belt platform is the WORST
[0:56:20] <+ThatOneGameTester> @The_Cassowary i assumed Puppet, great name by the way. that bird is a bloody dinosaur.
[0:56:24] <Pompadourius> YOOOO I NEVER DID THIS FLOOR ONE WTF
[0:56:38] <ColRedyx> Every group has a different floor mechanic.
[0:56:41] <$Big_King_Coconut> each platform has its own unique mechanic: oil, conveyors, or heads
[0:56:42] <clempstwitch> they really nailed this raid. Great that its only 1 of 3. Can't wait to see how Eden 2 turns out!
[0:56:43] <Pompadourius> For me it was rotating wind pushes
[0:56:46] <+Edrem> Alliance A gets electric floor, alliance B gets treadmills
[0:56:47] <Pompadourius> That's so cool that it's different
[0:56:48] <+Estuko> and she's hot
[0:56:50] <reonome> LUL
[0:56:51] <VJdarkworld> Hobbes, so the bosses continue the philosopher naming convention from automata. das cool :O
[0:56:52] <%ArcanumMBD> @Pompadourius alliance a b and c have different floors
[0:56:52] <%skizzuto> 2P with the carry
[0:56:53] <%Valdorick> 2P best girl?
[0:56:54] <%Finakala> Yeah the flamethrowers caught us out too
[0:56:55] <%RubberFistFight> jeez pat, get out of the fire Kappa
[0:56:55] <%ArcanumMBD> so it mixes it up
[0:56:57] <%Tucker0603> best grill
[0:57:00] <%animalxer> Pat can't help jumping into the flames
[0:57:04] <Pompadourius> That's such a cool mechanic that it changes, goddamn.
[0:57:07] <ColRedyx> Alliance C has the grate mechanic from Arboretum Hard.
[0:57:10] <Lagzlot> No, alliance c gets best grill.
[0:57:15] <%RubberFistFight> "offense heightened" ahh, the boss is a tumblrina
[0:57:16] <%ThePuddingDead> prize grabber from hell
[0:57:22] <%logoth_> ...Her name is actually 2P???
[0:57:29] <Frostilk> yup
[0:57:30] <Dragon_Batman> Wow I didn't think they would actually go with 2P as the name

[1:00:28] <Sokumotanaka> @Pompadourius They want to make money though and the point is I wanna see pat mark out
[1:00:29] <Onmi_Khaos> It killed me, because except Prime numbers, it's the easiest thing in the world to get.
[1:00:30] <scrashman> what is Pat swinging at?
[1:00:32] <+ThatOneGameTester> I miss Wildstar, that was a good game setting.
[1:00:39] <Calamity2007> @scrashman Welcome to end game FFXIV streams
[1:00:43] <Mendin> 2P just plays on Platinum Hard all the time and can perfect dodge

[1:01:09] <Frostilk> Hobbes is new
[1:01:09] <%floodtalon> "As long as the boss doesn't kill us we should be fine"
[1:01:10] <%Valdorick> "As long as the boss doesn't kill us, we should beable to kill the boss"
[1:01:11] <reonome> @Faustgesicht nobody he's new
[1:01:12] <Pompadourius> Pretty sure Hobbes is original to this.

[1:01:14] <Onmi_Khaos> It's hot key buttons
[1:01:18] <ColRedyx> @scrashman That circle on the ground is the range of the boss's hitbox.
[1:01:22] <Pompadourius> The arm stubby is new as well.
[1:01:23] <+metalsiren31> I mean as a general rule you win if the boss doesn't kill you yeah
[1:01:24] <Onmi_Khaos> Hold L2, Face buttons and directionals
[1:01:24] <%Finakala> Hobbes is new, yes
[1:01:26] <%Yakobro> @Rlexp d-pad/face buttons and trigger combo's with those

[1:01:37] <Onmi_Khaos> Then there's double tap
[1:01:39] <Asuxley> Hobbes will summon leviathan at the end Kappa
[1:01:41] <%Faustgesicht> Okay, then he's just a a psychology joke

[1:14:12] <FriendlyCheer> This was the future you chose
[1:14:13] <hntronium> 1
[1:14:13] <Lagzlot> Everybody wipes at least once to it, plenty of people who didn't do rabanastre when it was new so they skipped 1st boss's add phases.
[1:14:14] <+Silentman0> patfault
[1:14:15] <$oAlec687> Only Pats fault
[1:14:18] <Dhurkst> All according to Elmo's plan
[1:14:19] <Sokumotanaka> All this salt
[1:14:20] <%averyoddjew> but the "flour"
[1:14:21] <spiegspikel> 1
[1:14:22] <+King_floppy> I for one blame Elmo as well
[1:14:25] <Tampaoster> 1
[1:14:25] <%Vivi_the_Shishi> Pat you should check for railings
[1:14:26] <%starotter70> Elmo would have beaten the raid by himself
[1:14:26] <Pompadourius> Flour for everyone
[1:14:31] <deadbeat34> I like that 2P does the fight in a flight unit.
[1:14:32] <+th3madness> IS THAT WCS
[1:14:36] <$iaraCatunda> are ya wearing the 2b clothes?
[1:14:37] <%Finakala> My first run had no wipes tho mpieThink
[1:14:38] <ColRedyx> @Lagzlot It's not just Raba, most 24-mans have a split group mechanic.
[1:14:39] <%gespenst25> other tank grabbed the wrong add
[1:14:39] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> NEVER elmo's fault
[1:14:40] <+Kduff89> wait you have mario and luffy? LUL
[1:14:40] <Pompadourius> The new level 80 CUL endgame will be to prepare flour for everyone. ;)
[1:14:45] <BustRobot> I for one welcome our new communist robot overlords. Also I went a flight unit mount
[1:14:47] <Dakuu75> who the hell is 2P?
[1:14:47] <+King_floppy> DONT WORRY, IT'S JUST 'FLOUR' GUYS
[1:14:47] <+Edrem> Alliance B tank is a cosplayer, should check it out Kappa
[1:14:48] <Tampaoster> thats cocainum
[1:14:48] <%President_Miyazaki> So C was bad at Hobbes, B was bad at Goliath + Flight Unit, Pat was bad at Engels. Got it.
[1:14:52] <+Kduff89> this game is great
[1:14:59] <Huntercd> #blameelmo
[1:15:00] <Sokumotanaka> @Kduff89 Yeah it's a crossover baby
[1:15:00] <+Mitchellsocks> As an outsider to MMORPGs, is this gonna be the end of the nier thing?
[1:15:01] <Nina96> r u sure?
[1:15:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> crazy talk in 3. 2...
[1:15:04] <Monkeyweed21> yes you are
[1:15:06] <Mendin> So for those consued about everyone freaking over the flour: Nier A is a sequel to Nier. Nier is a sequel to Drakengard. At the end of Drakengard, a godbeast died in our world, spreading Evil Magic Salt which proceeded to basically ruin everything
[1:15:10] <Dementedpenguin> Believe in the future Pirate King
[1:15:10] <LeeOhX> the ready up check mark thing was pretty neat
[1:15:17] <grayjammer> Sure
[1:15:20] <Pompadourius> @Mitchellsocks There are two more NieR raids after this that will come out in future patches.
[1:15:21] <+twohitgood> what if they made final fantasy 16 in the nier universe and had yoko taro head it up/write it?
[1:15:22] <%Valdorick> apatCrazy
[1:15:28] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @Mendin Oh SHITTT I DIDN"T MAKE THAT CONNECTION THANK YOU!
[1:15:32] <%Yakobro> @Mitchellsocks he's on boss 3/4 of this one, there will be 2 more 6 months apart and there are quests before and after each part
[1:15:40] <tearsaurther> chat, is there a limit as to how many time you can die in a raid?
[1:15:41] <+Mitchellsocks> Ok thanks
[1:15:42] <PkSilent01> are we NEIR the final raid boss
[1:15:42] <%gespenst25> @mitchellsocks this is casual raid content
[1:15:49] <+HelloImTom08> @tearsaurther no
[1:15:53] <Pompadourius> @tearsaurther Nope, die as much as you want!
[1:16:04] <%Piemen99> What is he hitting? the big robit is over there
[1:16:06] <Dakuu75> I'm not seeing any samurai
[1:16:07] <Mendin> Said Evil Magic Salt either turns you into salt or a demon. Also it (and the dead dragon that killed the godbeast) introduced Magic into our world. It was generally a bad idea
[1:16:08] <cizal11> pat the tank buster is an aoe also don't hit your melee
[1:16:08] <reddpop_> You can die as long as you have the patience
[1:16:18] <Tampaoster> nier autotomato
[1:16:19] <Zerud> @Mendin I believe it was sort of a "joke ending" in drakengard that made canon in nier
[1:16:19] <Mendin> Androids were invented to clean up the Evil Magic Salt
[1:16:20] <ColRedyx> @6PoundsofShrimp White Chlorination Syndrome in Nier refers to people turning into salt. (Salt being sodium chloride)
[1:16:21] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @ chat if I were to get into this game now do I need to buy expansions right away? and play through all the old stuff to ge tto this?
[1:16:22] <DawnsRoyal> @tearsaurther nah, but there is a time limit for completing a raid, 2 hours for this one
[1:16:22] <FriendlyCheer> I wonder
[1:16:26] <+Mitchellsocks> Please have Adam appear, lol
[1:16:27] <%Yakobro> @tearsaurther when you die you get a big stat down that makes you do WAY less dmg/healing
[1:16:29] <Frostilk> youll see
[1:16:29] <Monkeyweed21> FINAL IS MASTER KENDO
[1:16:30] <%averyoddjew> head of square probably
[1:16:31] <Nina96> 9S?
[1:16:32] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:16:32] <%Valdorick> The robot is hurt by the feelings of the attacks.
[1:16:33] <+Maldoree> I cant wait for Pat to see the last boss,,,,
[1:16:33] <BustRobot> Oh Pat you are in for a treat.
[1:16:36] <aeonicvector> Finals definitley Mashed Potato Sakurai
[1:16:39] <+Mitchellsocks> Oh shit yeah, please Master Kendo
[1:16:39] <Dakuu75> @Monkeyweed21 omg, if only. lol
[1:16:41] <Pompadourius> SHADOWLORD FOR NIER RAID FINAL BOSS ANYBODY? EH? EHHHHH?
[1:16:42] <cizal11> lmfao
[1:16:42] <Tampaoster> nier automato
[1:16:42] <Covil91> The final boss is the president of Square-Enix
[1:16:42] <%AverageBlubber> @Piemen99 He's attacking the boss's spirit. Messing him up mentally. Not physically.
[1:16:45] <%blastazoid26> Final is the drifting boar
[1:16:45] <%Yakobro> LUL
[1:16:47] <+fearturkey24> the final boss is ourselves all along
[1:16:49] <cizal11> pat oyu have to LOOK at him
[1:16:50] <$Big_King_Coconut> hands up = front middle
[1:16:52] <+Silentman0> 1
[1:16:56] <reddpop_> Group goes front, pat thinks to go to the back
[1:16:57] <FriendlyCheer> the twins!
[1:16:58] <%Valdorick> The next one is the away and sides
[1:17:01] <ColRedyx> @6PoundsofShrimp You would need Shadowbringers to do this raid, but you can play up to level 35 for free.
[1:17:02] <arkv01> man this is a coolass raid
[1:17:05] <+Mitchellsocks> What if the final is the Godzilla robot
[1:17:05] <+HelloImTom08> @6PoundsofShrimp naw jus download to trail to see if you like it and than the base game of ARR b4 your buy the expansion
[1:17:06] <Mendin> Final boss better have a fucking flower or a rhythm game, if we've dropped the WCS on us at this boss
[1:17:08] <$shadow1man9> Different Tell animations too
[1:17:12] <tearsaurther> chat, thank you. now it makes more sense. I appreciate it. :)
[1:17:12] <Monkeyweed21> FATHER SERVO FINALE
[1:17:13] <Dakuu75> final boss is just gonna be a shit-ton of credits
[1:17:17] <aeonicvector> Final boss is the definition of a muffin
[1:17:19] <Dragon_Batman> That one guy running toward the middle LUL
[1:17:22] <%Yakobro> @Mendin it has SOMETHING alreight
[1:17:34] <transporterthesequel> So like, if Yoko Taro does tie Automata to Drakenguard in FF fucking XIV I am going to be so goddamn cross....and happy
[1:17:39] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @ColRedyx @HelloImTom08 Thank you, I'll download the trail today
[1:17:48] <%Valdorick> The final boss is Pascal just asking why you're attacking him. There's not even mechanics, its just 10 minutes straight of punching Pascal Kappa
[1:17:53] <%Finakala> Pls no
[1:17:57] <+HelloImTom08> sofiePog nice
[1:17:58] <%simulationbard> The final boss is confuting the fact that we live in a world without reason or purpose and figuring out where we go form there
[1:17:59] <%Finakala> Pascal is a good boi
[1:18:03] <%borkmire> hate having to rout my VPN to Singapore when ever major patches come out net is just above 2mb a second
[1:18:04] <$Big_King_Coconut> @Valdorick lmao
[1:18:05] <Zerud> @Valdorick that's evil
[1:18:05] <Mendin> @transporterthesequel THATS WHY I FLIPPED OUT WHEN THIS GOT ANNOUNCED, THEY LET YOKO FUCKING TARO TOUCH A FF FRANCHISE EVEN IN THIS SMALL WAY
[1:18:08] <reonome> pls no bully pascal
[1:18:12] <+Silentman0> final boss is chasing emil in his cart
[1:18:12] <+Linkmasterson> @Valdorick sounds like my kinda boss fight Kappa
[1:18:13] <%starotter70> The final boss is guilt
[1:18:16] <Tampaoster> gogo Mario healer
[1:18:17] <%floodtalon> I hope the final boss is a 5 page essay
[1:18:21] <UberKingKai> Everyday is a sale
[1:18:22] <+Huderga> do mess it up again
[1:18:25] <Mendin> The Potential Is Terrifying But Also Amazing
[1:18:25] <ColRedyx> @6PoundsofShrimp FYI you don't need to buy each expansion. Every expansion includes the ones that came before, so you just need ARR and Shadowbringers, or just get the complete version if you want the whole thing at once.
[1:18:27] <reddpop_> Final boss: "Do you agree there is no purpose for this raid?"
[1:18:29] <tearsaurther> I just wanna know what happened to Caim in Tokyo
[1:18:33] <BustRobot> Engels is such a polite giant robot
[1:18:33] <lethallylactic> The final boss is the friends we made along the way (who we brutally massacre)
[1:18:34] <FriendlyCheer> Now watch the other tank come steal it
[1:18:35] <+Estuko> @Valdorick what if the final is just entering the room with the kid robots while pascal and A2 are outside fighting and you can only attack LUL
[1:18:36] <Zerud> The final boss is a text only adventure LUL
[1:18:38] <Pompadourius> It's simple, we let the Sin Eaters get touched by White Chlorination Syndrome. That's how we restore peace to Norvrandt!
[1:18:44] <+Deosier> mario is doing work
[1:18:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @tearsaurther red eye, duh Kappa
[1:18:50] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @ColRedyx @HelloImTom08 Also I'm not a big FF fan tbh, can I still enjoy this game if I haven't play/beaten any FFs I played DQ more
[1:18:51] <reonome> the final boss is your character having an existential crisis about his humanity
[1:18:59] <Tampaoster> Mário Best healer
[1:19:01] <%skizzuto> Mario the strongest of summoners
[1:19:01] <pectusumbra> so is it you have to kill them fast to keep the charge from dunking you?
[1:19:04] <%Finakala> All numbered FF's are separate stories
[1:19:05] <deadbeat34> I think this is a dps check
[1:19:07] <HumanZac> did they add the Hildibrand quest line in the patch?
[1:19:07] <Dakuu75> I wish this'd have those creepy-ass ZOMBIE robots. those things are horrid looking
[1:19:07] <Nina96> nice
[1:19:12] <%Finakala> Although 14 does reference others
[1:19:13] <%Yakobro> @6PoundsofShrimp there are A LOT of references, but it's also its own story
[1:19:14] <ColRedyx> @6PoundsofShrimp You won't recognize the references but it's a much better intro to FF than most other recent games.
[1:19:15] <+Silentman0> @reonome which is wild since very few characters are humans
[1:19:16] <$arcielardor> the music is great
[1:19:17] <%animalxer> @Zerud set your macros for maximum text based adventure exploration
[1:19:17] <Pompadourius> No Hildibrand this time. Probably 5.2.
[1:19:17] <+Mitchellsocks> What if Grün is the final boss?
[1:19:17] <tearsaurther> @sphincter_spelunker I wanna see that adventure/story of red eye in game form
[1:19:19] <%starotter70> You did it
[1:19:25] <SlimeSlimeSlime> I want Papa Nier to show up.
[1:19:26] <filialpails> nice triangles
[1:19:28] <%floodtalon> uh oh
[1:19:29] <%starotter70> oh?

[1:19:38] <Graxe_> Remember this part of the fight in Automata?
[1:19:38] <%blastazoid26> Final boss is Ultimate Rat Boy Clemps
[1:19:40] <Pompadourius> Papa Nier or Shadowlord for final boss, I'm calling it.
[1:19:40] <DawnsRoyal> @6PoundsofShrimp so having the game + all expansions is about 50/60 bucks + monthly sub. there is a bunch of FF fanservice, but you don't need any prior info to enjoy this game, has a great standalone story too

[1:23:02] <DawnsRoyal> @6PoundsofShrimp you can play until lvl 35 for free, so just try it and see if you like it, sub may be a hard compromise, but getting like 30 hours a month for 15 bucks is already a pretty good deal
[1:23:03] <DjFrostBite95> LUL
[1:23:03] <Nina96> rip B
[1:23:04] <ColRedyx> @6PoundsofShrimp How often do you buy new games? Because if you play a new singleplayer game every month, that's what, $30+ a month? When you think in terms of price per game, MMOs are steep, but think in terms of price per hour.

[1:25:13] <ColRedyx> The animation tells you. If he's winding up an overhead smash, he's hitting the back. If it's a clap, it's the front.

[1:25:40] <DawnsRoyal> @6PoundsofShrimp depends on where in the world you play, if you're on EU you can hit me up for sure
[1:25:45] <Dakuu75> so, is it canon that Engles got fucked up by FFXIV parties before ending up where he did in Nier?

[1:37:46] <Pompadourius> @KazMkII There are gonna be two more like this.
[1:37:50] <ColRedyx> By the way, 2P always go to the side farthest from where 9S will come from.
[1:37:51] <FriendlyCheer> They come out in seperate patches ><
[1:37:54] <%Finakala> The 3rd stage raids are generally a lot more intense than the first, so hopefully this'll get ridiculous
[1:37:55] <Dakuu75> that is a STRONG platform you're fighting on
[1:37:55] <+Dreday543> OH!
[1:37:57] <%Jaxnos> 9S is very upset
[1:37:58] <%ogtrashwizard> wait is that striaght up Luffy raiding with pat?
[1:37:59] <ColRedyx> Just follow 2P to have the most warning time.
[1:38:00] <Mendin> Oh god that means the WCS will probably kick in at some point

[1:53:39] <%waifoong98> @XeroSigmaPrime who knows, may as well be alt universe?
[1:53:39] <Pompadourius> There's a quest after this.
[1:53:45] <DawnsRoyal> @noxturne yeah a bit more story after this
[1:53:48] <+2DSuperiority> There is more to do
[1:53:53] <Pompadourius> The quest after this has a prompt that implies that this raid has multiple story routes.
[1:53:54] <+Eddy21forsaken> give elmo the godd ol dick twist
[1:53:56] <seycheles> *cut to pat getting rear naked choked by elmo monkaS *
[1:54:05] <+noxturne> Nice, thanks
[1:54:06] <%Finakala> This is absolutely spinning off Automata and will link into Ni3R
[1:54:15] <+Estuko> @DawnsRoyal fuck off, you made me spit on my screen with that simple dumb joke.
[1:54:19] <+Estuko> @DawnsRoyal ♥
[1:54:30] <DawnsRoyal> hell yeah clzSip
[1:54:43] <Pompadourius> Yoko Taro went from the prequels to his games being in stage plays, to being in entire other video games. Madman.
[1:54:56] <CrypticMochi> So we got androids attacking this place for something and possibly the WCS? I wanna see Accord
[1:55:01] <DawnsRoyal> can't wait for the crystal exarch to be in the new nier game
[1:55:10] <%Deano8817> But when does geralt show up though?

[1:55:18] <deadbeat34> @pompadourius fuck, you're right.
[1:55:19] <Jdrockefeller> Omega f and m as super bosses for next nier
[1:55:19] <%Finakala> I can't believe Emet Selch is an android
[1:55:31] <Monkeyweed21> Does this mean Alphinaud can be in Smash?
[1:55:31] <+Silentman0> my only problem with the new raid is no kira buckland

[1:55:42] <%DFireCreations> apatSmug
[1:55:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> Maybe Yoko Taro is one of the Ascians.
[1:55:45] <Jdrockefeller> larboard and starboard for nier 3
[1:55:50] <+Walopoh> Just joined: so Paige brought the internet back with her?
[1:56:06] <+Estuko> Yokotaro appreciates hella ass and tiddy for sure.
[1:56:09] <cizal11> @mister___doctor the combat is more interesting than you'd think, but this kind of content in particular is meant to be done by pretty much anyone, so it's not particularly tough. and as the first one of 3 it's also gonna be the easiest of them.
[1:56:12] <+twohitgood> did anyone see the thing that the person saw in the final boss raid?
[1:56:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat got new internet with more fiber.
[1:56:18] <Monkeyweed21> @Walopoh the internet outages were due to an excess of "paint"
[1:56:27] <%Finakala> Squirrels did it
[1:56:29] <%starotter70> Pat DOES need his fiber
[1:56:33] <deadbeat34> Emil is an Ascian. he did split himself into many pieces after all.
[1:56:47] <+twohitgood> apparently one person saw something during the fight with 9s
[1:56:50] <+Walopoh> jk I listened to the podcast
[1:57:01] <%mister___doctor> I'm sure it's fun n gameplay it's just not very fun to watch
[1:57:02] <Nina96> is paige back yet?
[1:57:09] <+Walopoh> Neat that now Pat has NO excuses to not stream :)
[1:57:13] <%tizz86> i wish i could get fiber, I'm in a state of near permanent red bar primarily living in hotels

[1:57:54] <cizal11> @mister___doctor if you're remotely interesting, in roughly 2 weeks the real tough stuff is coming, and it might change your mind even about watching it. but in general you're kinda right tbh lol.
[1:57:59] <%Owkono> pee is stored in the balls
[1:58:02] <arkv01> yes agreed we must have bepis now

[1:59:10] <rubbishbinge> wuh happen
[1:59:10] <+Nobrev> found the bethesda mark
[1:59:10] <%kewlmyc> Taking points of for being a "clone" of something is stupid if the product is actually good.
[1:59:10] <+2DSuperiority> Bethesda bots in action
[1:59:12] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat i dunno why, but when you say "thats dumb" it feels so much harsher than stupid or other things.
[1:59:13] <%Owkono> he probably bought fallout 1st
[1:59:21] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat btw, maybe check Clemp's twitter, maybe not
[1:59:22] <lordsdb> Time to get the bear suits one boys!
[1:59:23] <%ShineTheDiamond> Thanks for clarifying, Pat!
[1:59:29] <%skizzuto> beautiful
[1:59:36] <%ThePuddingDead> wow rude
[1:59:39] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Wait this cant be post automata unless its some alternate universe?
[1:59:43] <%Finakala> Since Fallout has exited the premises, it needs a replacement
[1:59:51] <arkv01> yes hurry we must bury ourselves in 2putty
[1:59:53] <+whiskywolfe> yea rawk owt
[1:59:55] <%Owkono> that raid needs a mount

[1:59:56] <%ThePuddingDead> where even ARE you in the world?
[1:59:59] <%AncelDeLambert> wait wait wait, did Pat finish the entire raid, or is there fighting to come?
[2:00:10] <+Silentman0> @XeroSigmaPrime my theory is that it's after ending D and the machine ark landed on norvrandt
[2:00:13] <%ShineTheDiamond> These guys are adorable.
[2:00:15] <Nina96> 9S lies
[2:00:17] <rosemon5001> holy shit soo this what the game would look like if its wasnt covered whit gray
[2:00:21] <+Edrem> mind goblins pat
[2:00:22] <+metalsiren31> Yeah, robots never lie pvpKing
[2:00:24] <Pompadourius> Reminder that the end of Automata said that 9S and everyonr else were to be sent off into space and to another unknown world
[2:00:26] <Jdrockefeller> world domination bent potato

[2:00:50] <%AncelDeLambert> jesus christ, Taro, EXPLAIN YOURSELF!
[2:00:52] <+Walopoh> Question: if the Bethesda-Obsidian rivalry wasn't real then why did FO4 have about ZERO references to New Vegas and plenty for all of the other entries?

[2:13:59] <T_Sasquatch> Impressive how nier has its own unique apocalypse aesthetic
[2:14:00] <rosemon5001> @Furretposting2 i bet it is like that nines went away after waking and the machine network started mass producing 2models again
[2:14:03] <TastySammiches> I'm surprised these are just straight up nier automata maps
[2:14:05] <deadbeat34> machine corpses

[2:14:48] <%shawntk_> @ssjklyco If FF16 takes place in the Nier timeline that will be the biggest big dick move
