[0:33:09] <%squidking96> So unsub to hit the lower 1900 got it
[0:33:10] <@Jekado> what you need to do pat is make the number very LARGE unless there is more subs so it gets smaller
[0:33:10] <+HebbieJebbies> You know what's a nice round number? 0... Kappa
[0:33:10] <%ThomasOfTroy> 1000 is a nice even number with lots of zeroes
[0:33:11] <%AncelDeLambert> you heard the man, everybody, stop subscribing until it hits zero
[0:33:11] <%SuckerPunchSyd> 00000
[0:33:12] <%KetsuoTaberu> make font size increase with sub count

[0:33:45] <Teras_ode> LUL
[0:33:46] <%maskofmichael> I think it's fine
[0:33:47] <+facto905> sub count makes volume increase 1%
[0:33:47] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt make orb size increase with sub count
[0:33:47] <%Sotetsu> It's massive.
[0:33:49] <%hewlettfan96> Does binary code have nightmares about the number 2
[0:33:49] <@SoFarFetched> it needs to cover the screen
[0:33:49] <%walternatorz> number should be same height as text
[0:33:49] <@Jekado> start off HUGE then it will get smaller with more subs
[0:33:49] <%RealThiele> paige can make it smaller LUL
[0:33:50] <%ThomasOfTroy> I'd put the number under the cam tbh
[0:33:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> 1935 subs, 19.35 point font
[0:33:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> Can you make it slightly opaque? @PatStaresAt

[0:34:09] <%JoshManVGH> What happens when you become Mirror Pat!?
[0:34:09] <%Kemmybelle> Get the number to 10,000 to get the total amount of emotes.
[0:34:10] <+Saggitori> Can you make it even smaller
[0:34:12] <HaroldDonchee> there's so much bullshit on most streams these days it's nothing comparatively

[0:39:59] <ergulor> no
[0:39:59] <oda_flobunaga> Just Ask DSP
[0:39:59] <@SoFarFetched> and yes pat
[0:39:59] <LVL1_Scumbag> Basically
[0:40:00] <%Sotetsu> You write down things you'll do and it convinces peopel to sub
[0:40:00] <@tizz86> Yes
[0:40:00] <+facto905> literally
[0:40:00] <%patriotrenegade> lol I dunno
[0:40:01] <%JoshManVGH> Some people offer prizes
[0:40:01] <%MidnightBurst12> say number
[0:40:01] <%RayReborne> we hit goal, i do x nutso exciting thing
[0:40:01] <@ssjklyco> That sounds like it
[0:40:02] <brachydios777> kinda
[0:40:02] <Zeif00> yea
[0:40:02] <%baka_sugoi> GOALS
[0:40:03] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt its just Gacha Goal Numbers to subliminally influence your viewers, it can be pointless or it can be Goals related
[0:40:03] <%robotoken> pretty much
[0:40:03] <T_Sasquatch> it basically excites a bunch of simps to reach numbah
[0:40:04] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah you get goals
[0:40:04] <Edajos> yes
[0:40:04] <%Arkfyre> You set things to do once you get to certain amount of subs
[0:40:04] <%Fooguwu> I'm just now realizing that Pat has no marketing skills as a streamer
[0:40:04] <SummonerMagno> you shake orb
[0:40:04] <Tracazoid> "Give me arbitrary number"
[0:40:04] <+Shad8snake> yes
[0:40:04] <RayCSmooth> pretty much
[0:40:05] <%xbb1024> you do silly shit when you hit a goal
[0:40:05] <owazowski> Yeah
[0:40:05] <%Profmcstevie> Do thing if give money essentially
[0:40:05] <%MelBrooksKA> Remember when GOG was like "Yo, fuck China, we doing this lol" and then the next day went "we want to fuck China so..."
[0:40:05] <amymist> yeah i think so
[0:40:05] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt make a reward at the end
[0:40:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's just a number to get people to sub
[0:40:06] <artificiallynatural> you have a number you try to hit
[0:40:06] <%zyberion626> "If we hit 2k subs, I'll do something"
[0:40:07] <%DiscouragedOblong> The goal ususally has a reward and stuff
[0:40:07] <+megaman_sentinel> yes
[0:40:09] <%KineticZen> Subs usually increase time on the clock before you can end stream
[0:40:09] <+Jiggisnipe> just make a tier list Kappa
[0:40:11] <%Valdorick> Like "Show feet"
[0:40:12] <missingangle> "If I make 50k subs I'll pop a titty." Or something idk
[0:40:12] <%MooseIsGoose> Well if you get one of those ear mic's you have to like it for every sub
[0:40:12] <%patriotrenegade> yes
[0:40:13] <%Agami23> sometimes theres charity incentives too
[0:40:13] <%Monkeyweed21> if you hit the goal you have to stream Banjo Kazooie to completion @PatStaresAt
[0:40:14] <%cooldude69xx> Yes, but they pretend like theres more
[0:40:14] <%Wulfphelz> Yes
[0:40:15] <+Romuken> you reach the sub goal, you wear fishnets @PatStaresAt
[0:40:15] <%baka_sugoi> LUL 10
[0:40:16] <T_Sasquatch> like if you say sub goal at 2000
[0:40:16] <@Spydurman> yeah that works
[0:40:17] <Zeif00> Show bare orb at 2k
[0:40:17] <owazowski> Get big number so funny thing
[0:40:17] <ergulor> you cam also do it timed
[0:40:17] <%ScrapKingKeita> Subathons are a goal where subs do a thing, subgoal is a thing where you celebrate it when you hit it
[0:40:17] <%MidnightBurst12> yes pls
[0:40:18] <@SoFarFetched> I was ABOUT to donate 10 subs now
[0:40:18] <%lumporr> thats so many pies
[0:40:18] <%hewlettfan96> Damn u lazy Pat you should know that 101 streaming
[0:40:19] <%Sotetsu> 2000 subs: Healthy diet and excercise for 2 months!
[0:40:19] <%KetsuoTaberu> 5 subs, take it or leave it
[0:40:19] <%Ne1son> Yes do that
[0:40:19] <Tonicky > hence calling it a subgoal
[0:40:20] <%Chichen> pat youre gonna get hit by so many pies
[0:40:21] <%furiousfurioso> you could do that yea
[0:40:21] <ToneBacas> it's like reward tiers
[0:40:21] <%GhoulishCripple> I think you just choose a number of subs to aim for and we do things. like 2,000 Subs Paige throws eggs at you
[0:40:21] <%BrotherGaius> Yes
[0:40:21] <@SoFarFetched> until you said 20

[0:40:35] <%some_random_variable> I'd pay for that
[0:40:35] <%bravebravesrobin> too easy
[0:40:35] <keithcreuser> thats basically it
[0:40:35] <%ennui_on_me> Pat you can't get creampied on stream, you'll get banned
[0:40:36] <mr_saturday93> hehehe creampies
[0:40:36] <%toolofparanoia> You should get people to donate points for a milestone to add 5 subs
[0:40:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> Whipped cream pies
[0:40:36] <BlindGato> You'd drown in pies
[0:40:37] <%WhereIsWill> 50
[0:40:38] <@Spydurman> Hot Tub Stream at 100 subs
[0:40:38] <%JoshManVGH> Paige would just do it regardless
[0:40:39] <YuSlySumBich> Cum pies
[0:40:39] <%SveriSageAdvice> for a pie, yeah do 100
[0:40:39] <%lumporr> a sub per pie
[0:40:40] <%Wulfphelz> Only 20?
[0:40:40] <+purplestufff> It should definitely be 10 come on
[0:40:41] <Carquar> Or stream X game or stream game more longer, shit like that
[0:40:42] <Hs413> You would get so many fucking subs
[0:40:42] <SunsetJack> 20 is too little.
[0:40:42] <Teras_ode> creampies don't go to the face pat
[0:40:42] <StarlitStunner> Cream you say?
[0:40:43] <%bravebravesrobin> too much pies
[0:40:43] <@tizz86> don't tempt me
[0:40:44] <%hewlettfan96> He’d eat them all
[0:40:44] <Zeif00> This chat will spite sub for those pies
[0:40:45] <%TheWinged7> every sub Kappa
[0:40:45] <+GeneralGray8> I've even seen people do like 10 pushups for every 10 subs
[0:40:45] <%KetsuoTaberu> "Streamer sells out and gets creampied LIVE"
[0:40:45] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt PAT THINK ABOUT HOW MANY SUBS U JUST GOT
[0:40:45] <%Supermonaman> Hell yeah!
[0:40:48] <%SwdVengeance> Bald Pat for 5k subs
[0:40:48] <YuSlySumBich> Whipped cum pies
[0:40:49] <%blue8moon> you'd be hit in the face all the time LUL
[0:40:50] <@Spydurman> DO A SUBATHON
[0:40:50] <$realm_forge> This is just another ruse to get free pie
[0:40:50] <owazowski> Paige gives Pat an oral creampie
[0:40:52] <%PhantomMiG> But Woolie would steal them
[0:40:53] <+tempestzephyr> Do AMSR too
[0:40:54] <%Agami23> typically the goals are like "i'll stream lost in vivo at 200 subs!"
[0:40:55] <%baka_sugoi> LUL LUL LUL
[0:40:55] <%chance_h> Sub goal: Current sub count+1 repeat equation every time someone subs
[0:40:55] <%Sotetsu> I paid a friend to hit me with a cream pie once. It was great.
[0:40:57] <@ssjklyco> 1 million sub to see me skydiving
[0:40:57] <%RayReborne> Pat 20 gifted is NOTHING to Twitch chat
[0:40:58] <+Deekman> This is just a ploy to get @patstaresat a pie isn’t it
[0:40:58] <+megaotter> for every 20 subs you have to use a consumable
[0:40:59] <Laecerelius> SHOW ORB AT 4K SUBS
[0:40:59] <majindusto> Paige will Creampie Pat? enigmaKEK

[0:41:23] <%Profmcstevie> THE WEAPON CHANGES AS THE SUB GOAL RISES
[0:41:24] <%Agami23> "300 subs: give him the boots. medium style"
[0:41:26] <YuSlySumBich> Ginger gets cream pied on stream!!
[0:41:26] <+SpencerSDH> LOL
[0:41:28] <%baka_sugoi> V I O L A N C E
[0:41:29] <%hewlettfan96> You’d sompletely drown in it
[0:41:30] <Treasure_Vault> This sounds against twitch rules
[0:41:30] <%Sotetsu> Pat needs to raise his sub count for the baby. They are expensive.
[0:41:31] <missingangle> Paige you can do that for FREE
[0:41:32] <willsin4fun> It would be a great clip tho
[0:41:35] <HaroldDonchee> tizz gifts 1000 subs, "kill jester"
[0:41:35] <%MooseIsGoose> Her back would break
[0:41:36] <%zyberion626> Paige: Died of a shattered ass
[0:41:37] <+Romuken> you reach the sub goal, you wear fishnets
[0:41:37] <%strakillias> 100,000 subs: Pat shits pants live on stream
[0:41:37] <%rekinom> I dont think you can do slaps on twitch

[0:41:38] <%RedNeptonic> YES
[0:41:38] <Teras_ode> LUL
[0:41:38] <%Zeikier> "I beat wholesale ass for less than that. You get...40% power"

[0:41:43] <slothslayer828> ma bUtT
[0:41:44] <@ssjklyco> If paige slapped back, wouldn't that just destroy her hand?

[0:41:51] <Tracazoid> The bait
[0:41:53] <%baka_sugoi> THE BAIT
[0:41:55] <+SpencerSDH> Paige would crumple into a heap of dust and pat would die from overexertion.
[0:41:55] <willsin4fun> can Pat reach her for a face slap tho?
[0:41:56] <@tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to HaroldDonchee! They have given 517 Gift Subs in the channel!

[0:48:45] <@Jekado> ITS A MESS
[0:48:46] <%s_xylocalsingles> very on brand good job Pat
[0:48:46] <@ssjklyco> On brand
[0:48:47] <@QueequegTheater> You made it so much worse

[0:48:56] <%Forbidden_Karp> maybe keep it for the chat bits at the start and end?
[0:48:56] <%JoshManVGH> Notifications bottom middle?
[0:48:56] <%IronOhki> It looks cool until the sub dance procs.
[0:48:56] <MechanizedGentleman> scam artist claims to be a gamer, never plays games on his channel
[0:48:57] <javsomeclass> Looks like Pat is rubbing "Pat"
[0:48:58] <tranquilturnip> put the notifications above the cam
[0:49:00] <+Dumple_Roe> but it's an idea
[0:49:00] <@QueequegTheater> Dig up, stupid
[0:49:00] <Laecerelius> Like sub notification over your window and the number under
[0:49:02] <%valcheese> kinda...
[0:49:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> grafik deezeyen
[0:49:05] <%flagi64> did pat break the stream
[0:49:06] <%doomunderthestairs> ENJOY! psaDab
[0:49:07] <%hewlettfan96> That’s terrible messy and bad idea
[0:49:07] <%kewlmyc> Much better
[0:49:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Demon's Souls question. What's easier/quicker? 3-2 or 5-2?
[0:49:09] <%IronOhki> SNAP
[0:49:12] <+JustToWatch> now put the subs in the top right
[0:49:14] <+Havictos> @JoshManVGH God even with the shit those games suffered in terms of being unfinished I still love them. Human Revolution is still one of my favorites.
[0:49:14] <tranquilturnip> Patrons below the cam notifications above it
[0:49:15] <YuSlySumBich> Hey Pat, ignore the username I just wanted to say I genuinely appreciate the big funny energy you supply my life with and I’m sorry you had to see that super awful comment I made, it’s mine 1st time catching a stream live so I’ve just been typing stupid shit, thank you for the stream VoHiYo
[0:49:16] <critiquequartz> It would work if you put sub alerts somewhere else
[0:49:17] <@QueequegTheater> @KeiganOfAstora 3-2 by far
[0:49:19] <+tempestzephyr> i was predicting he was going to say "that looks like shit!"
[0:49:21] <%MooseIsGoose> they are uneven
[0:49:24] <%twistedj3ster> That's almost as bad an idea as whoever came up with whussy
[0:49:24] <%SovPho> It's off by like 2 pixels at the bottom
[0:49:27] <critiquequartz> Like anywhere else
[0:49:28] <@ssjklyco> Patrons in top left of screen and number on the bottom right of the screen to fuck with people
[0:49:28] <%RayReborne> PATrons lower my Goblins
[0:49:29] <%lumporr> why have this number anyway
[0:49:32] <%HaroldDonchee> are the camera and the numbers linked? like if he switches to right side will it all move
[0:49:33] <@QueequegTheater> @KeiganOfAstora 5-2 is the nightmare swamp
[0:49:33] <masterfire23> it's uneven NotLikeThis
[0:49:33] <willsin4fun> 7 pixels right
[0:49:33] <%kewlmyc> Oh no, the OCD is kicking in
[0:49:34] <The_hidden_> riveting
[0:49:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> I just wanna get through an area tonight but I forgot all the details of the areas
[0:49:36] <knotsundownsyndrome> god i wish i could read
[0:49:38] <%SovPho> Almost
[0:49:39] <%RedNeptonic> I would swap PATrons and the sub notifications lol
[0:49:42] <%SovPho> Yes
[0:49:44] <%SovPho> That's a yes
[0:49:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> I remember the swamp but I'm strong now and can rush it?
[0:49:48] <%Valdorick> Should we tell him?
[0:49:49] <%Quigsies> This is the Dragon Age Inquisition stream all over again
[0:49:53] <@SoFarFetched> yeah you do geefPlz
[0:49:53] <Laecerelius> Yeah, swapping them would be best
[0:49:54] <critiquequartz> Lol
[0:49:56] <%dalmek> the PATrons is more left than the number is right
[0:49:57] <@ssjklyco> It's Dragon Age stream again
[0:49:58] <Ekaelis> Oh hey, it's the game that made CDPR bend the knee to China
[0:50:01] <@Jekado> you can
[0:50:02] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Is there not a way to link the two items so they always line up
[0:50:03] <%baka_sugoi> numbers pat
[0:50:06] <%Zeikier> can't you use the arrow keys to move by a pizxel?
[0:50:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> is there a text box?
[0:50:10] <%kylejefferies> Put up the SFV training stage to have squares to line up on
[0:50:11] <@Jekado> if you select it and use the keyboard arrows
[0:50:11] <%JoshManVGH> Oh look, a bonus Pat Kills Goblins stream!
[0:50:11] <%blue8moon> tiny pat dancing over less-tiny pat
[0:50:12] <%SovPho> It's up by 1 pixel
[0:50:14] <iswearimjustdandy> Just got off work has he started yet?
[0:50:15] <MechanizedGentleman> goblins goin strong tonight, eh fellas?
[0:50:15] <@SoFarFetched> you do the keyboard arrows for pixel
[0:50:15] <artoflec> is it goblins time
[0:50:15] <%MooseIsGoose> Make them flush with the top of your box can you do that
[0:50:16] <%Arkfyre> psaHoldon
[0:50:17] <cBERBEN> arrows?
[0:50:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's fine
[0:50:20] <critiquequartz> I’d put sub alerts in a different cornir
[0:50:20] <%SovPho> It's not fine oh no
[0:50:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's not even but it's fine
[0:50:23] <%IronOhki> LIVE UPDATES
[0:50:23] <KNIGHTMARYxi> yeah
[0:50:25] <oda_flobunaga> I did not expect another Goblins Stream so soon
[0:50:25] <@Jekado> yeah
[0:50:27] <%baka_sugoi> yeah that too
[0:50:29] <%PrimalDweeb> Put the numbers back down, and put notifications above you.
[0:50:30] <@SoFarFetched> It should
[0:50:31] <%Zeikier> damn
[0:50:31] <%WhereIsWill> any streamer knows this pain wherei6Spooked laynaWHYTHO
[0:50:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> yes it does
[0:50:33] <@Jekado> you have to select the layer first
[0:50:36] <%Zeikier> un-damn!
[0:50:36] <majindusto> One pixel...Gremlins furious
[0:50:36] <Ozavic> @ReallyBigRocks Because the number updates it needs to be its own box
[0:50:37] <%TheWinged7> its working
[0:50:39] <%HaroldDonchee> pixel small
[0:50:40] <@Jekado> and you can pixel move it
[0:50:41] <%RayReborne> LOWER
[0:50:45] <$realm_forge> I find the one pixel adjustments alarmingly relatable
[0:50:49] <@Jekado> there is also an align
[0:50:54] <%lumporr> the only solution is to put them at the bottom and count the number of times you hit the arrow
[0:50:55] <%JoshManVGH> Oh so it's FFXIV UI logic?
[0:50:55] <%hewlettfan96> pat is the archetypal keyboard warrior
[0:50:56] <MechanizedGentleman> nah that looks terrible, move it back
[0:50:58] <+Vysryal> plagueFace plagueFace plagueFace plagueFace

[1:09:18] <%Agami23> most ghosts are old people so they are made to be racist
[1:09:21] <Treasure_Vault> One day your ghost will be too racist for the cool new kid ghosts

[1:09:30] <zerointelligence000> what if ghost society is surprisingly progressive? they've seen the passage of history
[1:09:31] <%TIME_PUNCHER> more ghosts are historically racist than not

[1:09:46] <%Gogogolem> Every ghost i've met in kentucky has been super Racist, and also have those weird pointy heads.
[1:09:47] <BallerSwagBro9k> I think ghosts would get over racism after a while

[1:14:05] <%RayReborne> WHAT? wow thats........ fucking garbage
[1:14:05] <jorniev> fuck
[1:14:05] <scarman125> what even is Destiny 2 ay this point?
[1:14:06] <brachydios777> Dreaming City will remain, still sucks about the shore
[1:14:06] <ExpressNode> The only time I ever touched Destiny 2 was when I got the White PS4 Pro edition that came with it and I traded in on the same day after an hour
[1:14:07] <%asgard147> so what you're saying is quit destiny 2? Got it limesOk
[1:14:08] <%TIME_PUNCHER> so we can visit maybe 2 planets in the solar system
[1:14:08] <T_Sasquatch> destiny takes a decade to download and install on ps4 to be fair but yea fuck that
[1:14:09] <%Wallabri> what
[1:14:11] <bear_breaker20> they really want you playing fucking gambit
[1:14:11] <%GarbageNirvana> amazing
[1:14:11] <%polothegreatest> Why no releasing destiny3
[1:14:11] <@Lion_kun> Pat, apparently Lost Judgment patched the robotics club so they drop 3x the materials.
[1:14:12] <Lupinzee> they are obtainable what
[1:14:13] <supergoblinpunch> Wow, good deal
[1:14:13] <%Monkeyweed21> I'm pretty sure that Destiny 2 still has totally uncompressed audio btw
[1:14:15] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt so only 1 expansion is still there?
[1:14:15] <+sewermonk> its like they saw warframe vaulting and thought "what if we did that, but stupid?"
[1:14:17] <%ape_hawk> because load times were the biggest issue?
[1:14:17] <maskedmook> that's ridiculous
[1:14:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> imagine if you pulled out Mario 64 and part of the game was just gone
[1:14:19] <%rekinom> "Buy our new content btw we're removing content you already paid for"
[1:14:20] <%bravebravesrobin> why Destiny stupid?
[1:14:20] <%lumporr> like what would be the fucking point
[1:14:21] <+Ser_Ser_Ser> gotta have that native 4k right
[1:14:21] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt  You can still get those exotics
[1:14:23] <ohno778> and I thought removing activision from the picture would make the game better.
[1:14:25] <intestinal_bleeding> yeah they keep sunsetting content right?
[1:14:26] <%JoshManVGH> But.... wha.... FFXIV has HOW MANY areas!?

[1:58:27] <%terrible35> case closed
[1:58:28] <Zombrocom> Kinda killed the effect for me
[1:58:29] <%RealThiele> children always make things worse
[1:58:40] <@Jekado> Four means death in Chinese and Japanese languages
[1:58:41] <PirateMike_> It looked like the ballerina was headbanging
[1:58:42] <%Forbidden_Karp> it doubles as a way to find the Avatar
[1:58:45] <%Daxalog> Damn

[1:59:02] <scrumbotime> homophobic items
[1:59:09] <%maskofmichael> @cobalt_phoenix_ I think the way they say 4 also sounds like the way they say death
[1:59:16] <%Piemono> What does Streamer sound like in Chinese?
[1:59:16] <dukenux> ok, but how many people did place GUN?
[1:59:18] <+ScreenTerror> babies a biggot
[1:59:22] <PirateMike_> @GalacticaPhanto HeyGuys
[1:59:24] <Dunmarkh> @scrumbotime Guess that makes you a composer
[1:59:26] <Treasure_Vault> This is how the figure out which baby is the dalai lama
[1:59:27] <KasiCrafter> Hey kid, choose your LIFE PROFESSION AT BIRTH
[1:59:28] <SaltyAzteca> THE MORE YOU KNOOOW
[1:59:32] <%RealThiele> baby grabs the n-pass oh nooo
[1:59:33] <%DianaTheAscian> so this is where that ATLA thing came from
[1:59:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ ah ok, i kinda knew is was a bad thing but never knew why
[1:59:36] <+ShutUpAceyP> reminds me of Runescape, where Trolls were named after the first thing they tried to eat.
[1:59:36] <+tempestzephyr> give it a potato
[1:59:38] <+MisterAvry> sometimes you read about a tradition and think "someone's grandma just made this shit up one day, didn't she?"
[1:59:40] <Parapattern> Assigned cop at birth
[1:59:45] <brachydios777> Remember the gas mask children in Doctor Who also?
[1:59:47] <DSD24> What if I want to multiclass at the beginning?
[1:59:48] <%HaroldDonchee> the kid chose beets
[1:59:49] <Meekest> Woolie origin story
[1:59:52] <%crimsonharvest> gonna show the baby a selection of v-tubers
[1:59:56] <scrumbotime> Make the baby racist
[2:00:00] <Treasure_Vault> Dalai lama has to grab the right toys to be recognized
[2:00:00] <%AncelDeLambert> to let you know how bullshit it truly is, parents WILL push the baby as best they can to certain objects on display
[2:00:03] <+TombstoneTTromboners> wow i love tv
[2:00:03] <+ShutUpAceyP> nice use of live action
[2:00:04] <%GalacticaPhanto> fuck nevermind imma try to stay strong because this does look cool ooooof

[2:00:10] <+doc_ock_rokc> @brachydios777 are you my mummy

[2:00:25] <+DrGecko> Jeopardy is different there
[2:00:25] <%YuSlySumBich> Place Blue and red in front of the baby to figure out if they a crip or a blood
[2:00:26] <%Sotetsu> Clap
[2:00:26] <dukenux> remember the time when tv in games was just static images?

[2:04:38] <+schmonker> parting tne red seas

[2:05:11] <+lucaflowe> Getting blood out is first aid 101
[2:05:12] <+MisterAvry> I think most of my childhood injuries were blunt force so there wasn't much blood to wash up
[2:05:14] <Heartless080> @Heartless080 ah gotchya - makes sense

[2:46:35] <+Kitrane> this is less terror horror and more existential horror huh?
[2:46:37] <%ape_hawk> well, pills werent doing anything because her breathing problems are from her family, not health
[2:46:37] <akitanito> dad's a shit

[2:46:49] <%keyoray> So far, i'm really loving this game
[2:46:49] <shadowstreakXIII> So I looked it up and all the fake TV show bits were created just for the game. Manson Chang, the director of Detention's documentary, helped out with it.
[2:46:57] <dukenux> so it was psychosomatic?
[2:47:02] <%PrimalDweeb> Reminds me of someone I know...

[3:05:58] <%CalderGaming> lmao
[3:06:03] <dds333a> I can relate kiddo, as a child
[3:06:06] <knotsundownsyndrome> this game is great at inducing a whole lot of anxiety
[3:06:06] <Sigma_190_Beta> Yeah, Pat's just a bit tinier.
[3:06:08] <%Dakuu75> chat, lmao
[3:06:08] <@SoFarFetched> "well look who decided to come out of their cave and be part of the family"
[3:06:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> Its too tall for a pat simulator
[3:06:11] <+StingRayVA> ba-by
[3:06:12] <akitanito> big mad pat
[3:06:13] <scrumbotime> it takes pat a fortnight to make it to his bed with his tiny tiny steps
[3:06:14] <Vlesh> Cool scene right here
[3:06:14] <dds333a> I tried, but it was awkward
[3:06:15] <%tank7013> You're right, the hands are too big
[3:06:16] <%SovPho> Is this boring? I have a diluted sense of what's going on because I'm playing something else
[3:06:16] <PirateMike_> Theres no closet big enough to hold me
[3:06:17] <shieldecho> Hiding until guests/relatives leave. Sounds like a dream.
[3:06:18] <+KingpinLarry> Sing Free Bird
[3:06:19] <CatRidder> a rat simulator
[3:06:20] <%solracc25> these are bad times
[3:06:21] <%YuSlySumBich> GIEF SIM
[3:06:21] <pokketlint60> Hey Pat, since you control both the child and the father, does that mean this game has a zapping system?
[3:06:24] <artoflec> @SoFarFetched please elaPain
[3:06:25] <brachydios777> Didn't Avatar do that to determine the Avatar?
[3:06:30] <SoaringTrumpet> not boring
[3:06:33] <+doc_ock_rokc> FREEBIRD!!!
[3:06:34] <%DianaTheAscian> Its to big for a Pat simulator

[3:06:54] <%idyota> idyota subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[3:06:56] <%flagi64> Anyone ever notice that the point of all of these horror games is don't be a shit parent?
[3:06:56] <Dunmarkh> fuck you dad
[3:07:01] <dds333a> @sovpho nah
[3:07:03] <Lancaster_H> @brachydios777 yeah, its also a real tradition related to the selection of Dalai Lama iirc
[3:07:04] <%DianaTheAscian> @brachydios777 yeah
[3:07:05] <samTUMZfestival> Is he like a sports father? Only about singing?
[3:07:06] <DaCheekyOne> MORE PRESSURE
[3:07:23] <%king_wragles> @Ranryu692 mom and dad are fighting and it's making the eldritch horror sad
[3:07:24] <%xbb1024> Resident evil locks
[3:07:25] <Dunmarkh> That's a resident evil ass item
[3:07:28] <%solracc25> oh no there's 1 and 2
[3:07:29] <31uvatar> what a relief
[3:07:35] <artoflec> the team did a good job of explaining these cultural specifics without making the text boring
[3:07:38] <samTUMZfestival> @flagi64 I want one to go the other way.
[3:07:44] <%solracc25> loading spooks
[3:07:45] <MechanizedGentleman> has this game done a big frighten yet?
[3:07:46] <Vlesh> We gotta go back to the future, Pat!
[3:07:55] <+OnTheDonner> @flagi64 Yeah, partly why I find them boring to play
[3:07:55] <+Vigonept> this is a big house like yo
[3:07:55] <dds333a> @samtumzfestival somewhat. he's insecure about his own lack of wealth and standing, and what's his daughter to succeed where he didn't
[3:08:09] <+TombstoneTTromboners> ah, 1985 by bowling for soup
[3:08:12] <%Ziegsy> `oh wow I must have grabbed nothing as a baby
[3:08:13] <@SoFarFetched> @samTUMZfestival no just being an asian parent. With the mom being a popular sing it's to assume the daughter MUST be as well.
[3:08:13] <%DianaTheAscian> we need to go back
[3:08:15] <samTUMZfestival> Don't get PREOCCUPIED
[3:08:19] <PirateMike_> Boys is it gay to have a favorite flower

[3:09:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> ALL FLOWERS ARE PLANT DICKS ANYWAY
[3:09:26] <insomniac_doze_> liking cute things and not being insecure about it is the chadest thing
[3:09:27] <+KingpinLarry> Do mushrooms count as flowers?
[3:09:29] <%king_wragles> I think mine's either marigolds or pansies
[3:09:31] <%Agami23> theres tons of flowers that look like dicks.
[3:09:32] <critiquequartz> There’s an orchid that looks like someone showing off their dick
[3:09:33] <%Forbidden_Karp> they absolutely do not
[3:09:34] <%YuSlySumBich> Guys is it gay to talk about dicks on stream?
[3:09:34] <+StrikeTheErf> there's one called a Seedy flower iirc
[3:09:35] <iswearimjustdandy> Most flowers ARE dicks, if you think about it
[3:09:35] <%Cozy90> @CalderGaming i know Kappa
[3:09:37] <@Ranryu692> @doc_ock_rokc but they're also plant vaginas
[3:09:37] <DomunDomunDomun> Amorphophallus Titanum
[3:09:38] <schiester420> these orchids that look like little dudes with their cocks out
[3:09:43] <%maskofmichael> @BinaryFireball Yeah, fuck it, Flussy
[3:09:46] <mr_saturday93> if I stare at Pat's orb for to long is it gay?
[3:09:47] <%Forbidden_Karp> but there are some very suspicious looking mushrooms
[3:09:47] <+orochiblood> the husband is a hack lmao
[3:09:48] <peyodogo> copihues
[3:09:51] <%king_wragles> @KingpinLarry go back to bed
[3:09:52] <%doomunderthestairs> mushrooms although cool in their own right are fungi not flowers
[3:09:56] <godzookylives> is it gay to have hardcore anal sex with your bro?
[3:10:01] <%keyoray> ..mixed feelings
[3:10:01] <%YuSlySumBich> Any flower can be a dick as long as you try hard enough
[3:10:02] <%Forbidden_Karp> this is true
[3:10:10] <%doomunderthestairs> but they do look more penis like
[3:10:13] <seaechiowai> @iswearimjustdandy if you eat flowers it's bad
[3:10:14] <knotsundownsyndrome> @godzookylives not yet
[3:10:14] <samTUMZfestival> Is that Polpo's lighter?

[3:10:24] <Vlesh> He's still completely missing one puzzle
[3:10:26] <dukenux> @schiester420 prolly why they're aphorodisiacs in first place
[3:10:27] <KaitlynnHere> @godzookylives absolutely not
[3:10:28] <%Agami23> theres a giant one in france named "the titans penis"
[3:10:30] <%YuSlySumBich> Is it gay to ingest mushrooms??
[3:10:32] <dds333a> @godzookylives only if you don't say "no homo"
[3:10:39] <%Ziegsy> When I was in scholl there was this urban legend of a disease that made a guys dick open like a flower
[3:10:43] <%BinaryFireball> @maskofmichael do you need your flussy polinated?
[3:10:45] <Dunmarkh> @godzookylives Just make sure the balls don't touch. Cowgirl position is recommended
[3:10:45] <%Forbidden_Karp> I think that might be a balcony for hanging clothes or something

[3:12:53] <+orochiblood> anxiety disorder
[3:12:54] <@Ranryu692> Pat should play Night Delivery, that seems like it would've been a Shitstorm favorite
[3:12:57] <%X2Eliah> So... Do you think the communist party approved this game and the message it sends? Or is this game also banned in china?
[3:12:58] <%flagi64> yep
[3:12:59] <$lotharrio> Man, that snake is questionable.

[3:26:34] <Lynxystem> was gonna say, feels like less so crazy religious people and just, more or less the Shurra PiPi Cult from Yakuza 0 chwKEK

[3:26:48] <DSD24> Is she not gonna take the Kid with her?
[3:26:48] <Cherokia666> but also leaving him with the kid... uhhh
[3:26:51] <%tank7013> Everyone should do it
[3:26:54] <brachydios777> Divorse is rad
[3:26:55] <+Havictos> @DSD24 Sadly they're still a huge problem even today
[3:26:56] <dds333a> here we are
[3:26:56] <%Profmcstevie> Okay but take the kid too, don't leave them with that
[3:26:57] <%AncelDeLambert> divorcing your husband in a culture that HATES it doesn't, tho
[3:27:00] <DaCheekyOne> Divorcing a husband in a conservative society is horrible
[3:27:01] <pokketlint60> You know it's funny how video games feature "cults" a lot but they're basically just armies of religious zealots. It's rare for a game to show how cults harm people in reality.
[3:27:04] <pscarnage> @Cherokia666 pretty much, very prevalent. even today, though it's not as "loud" about it anymore
[3:27:06] <ohno778> not liking religion isnt a zoomer take
[3:27:08] <CatRidder> the cult of universal truth
[3:27:12] <dukenux> @Lynxystem those are the same thing
[3:27:14] <%AncelDeLambert> @Profmcstevie she CAN'T, the kid belongs to the father

[3:44:45] <DSD24> Dodd you need to stop
[3:44:45] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> this is like the kind of people that do horse paste instead of just getting vaccines bc they want to be special
[3:44:46] <PirateMike_> This does not seem like the most efficent way to do this
[3:44:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> AT LEAST CUT IT FFS
[3:44:46] <%PhysicsLB> fuckin WHAT
[3:44:48] <%Rafferty3231> wtaf

[3:44:50] <nevan_44> AAAAAAAAAAAA
[3:44:54] <dukenux> This is the WORST way to get rid of a tongue
[3:44:54] <%Nekros4442> you can't do that the tongue is a huge muscle in ur mouth
[3:44:54] <dashmatt> I'm pretty sure it doesn't work like this
[3:44:54] <%TheBensonator_> YUP
[3:44:55] <HeroSolaire> that makes no sense
[3:44:55] <Morsuzado> I don't think a tongue would rip out like that
[3:44:55] <Louie_Salmon> YOU DON'T EVEN CUT IT, IT'S JUST A PULL?
[3:44:55] <dds333a> btw, that is not possible
[3:44:56] <dukenux> for real
[3:44:56] <@Ranryu692> yeah I don't think it works like that
[3:44:57] <%smoothwood07> brutal
[3:44:57] <%AncelDeLambert> did we HAVE to go into body horror?
[3:44:57] <%Phantomjay> im not sure which is worse
[3:44:58] <Ethel9727> That would kill you so hard
[3:44:58] <critiquequartz> Send help I just did the hand over my own eyes thing
[3:44:58] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it's fine
[3:44:59] <Zebroneath> That WILL kill you
[3:44:59] <%moodwich> psaDown psaDown psaDown psaDown
[3:44:59] <+MackFighters> you'd bleed out so fast bruh

[3:44:59] <%Anime_Flux> man this cult is STRICT
[3:44:59] <knotsundownsyndrome> yes, that should kill you
[3:45:00] <$SGrim> Enjoy bleeding to death
[3:45:00] <%Nekros4442> you'd die before you pulled it out
[3:45:00] <%solracc25> meaty
[3:45:04] <CatRidder> yea that doesnt work
[3:45:04] <logothete2401> people have survived that before
[3:45:04] <%XzileGaming> the pain woulda knocked u out
[3:45:04] <%ape_hawk> just the amount of blood loss along
[3:45:05] <Eseph_AGen> yucky
[3:45:05] <%AncelDeLambert> also no that's not how that works
[3:45:07] <%Agami23> dont worry dude, your daughters not a lunatic at all!
[3:45:08] <%Undenizen> it's like part of your throat
[3:45:08] <artoflec> yeah that's fuckin rough if you can't handle gore LUL

[3:45:17] <%Mr_Pylon> man double fatalities himself
[3:45:17] <%DianaTheAscian> He would bleed to death within min
[3:45:19] <%lumporr> would it not just fucking rip at the points where it was stabbed?
[3:45:20] <rearedlogarithm> No bueno
[3:45:20] <SaltyAzteca> FINAL??
[3:45:20] <Vlesh> It would kill you if he was physically doing this, he's spiritually doing it

[3:45:24] <brachydios777> He should be super dead

[3:45:24] <%Ser_Ser_Ser> Didn't he take normal pills tho
[3:45:25] <SoratheWonderful> You would have choked on your own blood
[3:45:26] <%Mekhet09> Is this an organ harvesting cult?

[3:45:29] <DSD24> Look at your eyeless and tongueless ass
[3:45:31] <%spacegloom> i really think it would just rip through your tongue, not pull it out
[3:45:31] <%ape_hawk> is the final prayer the numbers of your credit card?

[3:46:24] <dds333a> classic
[3:46:26] <%solracc25> it's bluuuuud
[3:46:26] <%jinking79> least it's not the eyes

[3:46:38] <pscarnage> @Heartless080 nah, the folks in china actually really liked this game because how close to home it hits, it wasn't till someone found pooh game in the gamedata then they all shat on it
[3:46:38] <Sol_Install> you don't need to twist
[3:46:39] <%Ser_Ser_Ser> could be in his head
[3:46:39] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> could be mind-talking
[3:46:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This doesn't seem nearly as bad as the last two
[3:46:42] <Vlesh> NOT PHYSICAL, SPIRITUAL.
[3:46:43] <blahblahgwar> its not a bmetaphor
[3:46:43] <Heartless080> @Heartless080 Really?? that's it??

[3:53:48] <scrumbotime> And if the kid dies, woops, the dad did the kill, can't pin it on the guru
[3:53:50] <@SoFarFetched> @cobalt_phoenix_ well its more on the wording on the medical paper. It simply said "no health issues see a psychatrist" and the dad assumed the worst thinking she might be crazy. Because the words "psychiatrist" can make people quick to assume "oh crazy"
[3:53:52] <Chatterbox1991> WHATS IN THE BATHTUB
[3:53:52] <vicar_anat> man FUCK cults

[3:58:36] <+TombstoneTTromboners> @TombstoneTTromboners shit like this actually happened in taiwan
[3:58:36] <%JoshManVGH> Sometimes sorrow is the scariest emotion of all.
[3:58:38] <CaptainBright> Hell, I can swear to you on my fucking grave, my friend's mom who had cancer placed more faith in spiritual/ chinese medicinal physicians than doctors.

[3:59:57] <%Mekhet09> Basically.
[3:59:57] <%Puhff> I was not expecting korean (?) psych rock to close this gmae out
[3:59:57] <Vlesh> The band doing this song is called "No Party for Cao Dong"
[4:00:06] <dds333a> And there's another family, destroyed
[4:00:07] <pscarnage> @Puhff mandarin/chinese

[4:00:12] <mr_saturday93> @arcielardor not intentionally but he moronically believed in cult shit
[4:00:13] <CaptainBright> @pscarnage Thankfully it is passing on; the problem is now the emergence of cults
[4:00:14] <+orochiblood> @Rafraud oh well
[4:00:14] <%Mekhet09> The id should have fucking gotten out and gone to the sin.
[4:00:17] <%Mekhet09> skin.

[4:00:20] <iswearimjustdandy> @vlesh THANK YOU

[4:00:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ArCielArDor yea, left her in a tub full of snake wine for 7 days
[4:00:22] <%lumporr> no jumpscare
[4:00:24] <KaitlynnHere> @arcielardor the spiritual leader told him to leave her in a wine bath for seven days
[4:00:25] <%Mekhet09> The kid should have gone to the sink.
[4:00:26] <%athuramn> Discord!?
[4:00:26] <%BisoromiBear> now it's time for her revenge
[4:00:28] <Khorneflakes_> @Mekhet09 I can't name this cult particularly, but there was this interesting youtube vid with this game talking about this cult in Taiwan that took advantage of people
[4:00:30] <%tank7013> I mean it was a good song and all but... what? huh?

[4:01:02] <shieldecho> @Khorneflakes_ Was that the Eyepatch Wolf video?
[4:01:04] <artoflec> yeah this game is just unbelievably sad and not actually that scary btw lol

[4:01:31] <Essixian> @tank7013 The cult leader told him to perform a bullshit ritual to "cure" the anxiety and panic attacks he gave his daughter by way of massive expectations, which ended up killing her
[4:01:33] <@SoFarFetched> geefCry
[4:01:33] <+orochiblood> you got the 'good ending' according to some people? idk if theres multiple endings or not

[4:01:46] <%asgard147> limesCry
[4:01:47] <dds333a> I tend to think he relives the trauma before his death
[4:01:47] <%Fooguwu> guess this was his Near Death Experience (though actually ending in death)
[4:01:48] <wolfen091> somebody once told me the world was gonna own me, I aint the sharpest tool in the shed
[4:01:48] <Vlesh> Yeah father is dead. This is his afterlife, regret.

[4:02:26] <maskedmook> this is not what I came here for wtf
[4:02:27] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt so did you like the game? rating out of 10?
[4:02:29] <SoratheWonderful> Now to get the BAD ENDING
[4:02:30] <%Puhff> JAZZ SAX
[4:02:30] <Khorneflakes_> One of those endings where you have to get up and contemplate the meaning of life
[4:02:32] <%ScrapKingKeita> Fun bit of Chinese occult stuff: A classic curse is to gather a bunch of toxic animals and to put them in a hyper toxic one, which you can use as a curse, or as a panacea.
[4:02:32] <shieldecho> Yeah Eyepatch wolf's video on this game is excellent
[4:02:34] <KaitlynnHere> Does he down himself in the same water? Cause that’s gross
[4:02:34] <Archmortal> yeah so fuck cults
[4:02:37] <+KingpinLarry> I came here for a bad time, not a sad time.
[4:02:38] <%Ser_Ser_Ser> BibleThump
[4:02:39] <+orochiblood> that was the 'good ending'
[4:02:39] <iswearimjustdandy> I finished the outerwilds dlc earlier, so this was a one two punch
[4:02:40] <%Faustgesicht> I'm chilling to this smooth sax. how you doin?
[4:02:42] <%JoshManVGH> It's criminal that this game was taken down from stores
[4:02:46] <%asgard147> I came to be scared, not to be sad limesFeels limesFeels
[4:02:48] <Tonicky > Idk if he killed himself since the game starts with him catatonic watching tv while the wife asks where the kid is
[4:02:48] <samTUMZfestival> SOS
[4:02:50] <HellWhiskers> HellWhiskers gifted a Tier 1 sub to funnystreamerbtw! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[4:02:55] <Rafikator> I feel nothing.
[4:02:58] <%IDTheftVictim> IDTheftVictim subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! What a great upbeat start for my weekend. In all seriousness hope you play more of these games over the month this was great.
[4:03:02] <Khorneflakes_> @JoshManVGH yeah, yeeaaah
[4:03:02] <%Reaped_Psyche> I've heard that this kind of catastrophic cult shit was super common in 80s Taiwan.
[4:03:03] <Frostydough1> Metroid time? :D
[4:03:06] <%lumporr> cults are bad, mk
[4:03:10] <doster504> dammit I just got here
[4:03:12] <+vdalson> the production value of this game felt very high
[4:03:13] <artoflec> im just glad this game is available again, i mean, for the 20 000th first person horror game out there this one will always stand out
[4:03:13] <Vlesh> @Tonicky When the credits end and the start screen comes back, you'll see, he is dead.
[4:03:19] <theshillman> oh no im 4 hours late
[4:03:21] <%DianaTheAscian> This song is nice at least
[4:03:21] <%baka_sugoi> TIME LINES NotLikeThis
[4:03:28] <$realm_forge> I remember this game going waaay different
[4:03:31] <Louie_Salmon> Being catatonic on a couch seems like a decent metaphor for being dead anyway
[4:03:32] <PirateMike_> Bruh
[4:03:37] <Rafikator> super eyepatch wolf will tell you about how bad cults are
[4:03:40] <critiquequartz> I actually thought the part leading to the elevator sequence was really good
[4:03:40] <Vernify> I'm still surprised the game hasn't been put back up on some store front out there.
[4:03:40] <Khorneflakes_> Yeah, this game is great
[4:03:42] <brachydios777> solid 8/10 game

[4:04:07] <Vlesh> @DianaTheAscian Only one ending.

[4:04:16] <+Goldenfedora99> What's the name of the band again?
[4:04:18] <%X2Eliah> Every person on these credits is now on China's black list.
[4:04:19] <mr_saturday93> So there was an ARG for this game that's kinda like a sequel
[4:04:20] <%PrimalDweeb> Fuck China.
[4:04:20] <KaitlynnHere> China hates anything that doesn’t paint China in a good light
[4:04:23] <%keyoray> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[4:04:24] <+TombstoneTTromboners> time for the post-credits

[4:04:27] <%Mekhet09> @Undenizen This is because of taiwan.
[4:04:28] <%AncelDeLambert> the CCP doesn't like any admission that its native culture has any form of problems
[4:04:32] <%Mekhet09> So fuck them even harder.

[4:06:30] <peyodogo> fuck
[4:06:31] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> it was a good game and i enjoyed
[4:06:32] <+JustToWatch> In retrospect, when I said "Devussy" at the beginning of the game, that may have been in bad taste
[4:06:35] <amymist> it was heavy
[4:06:37] <iswearimjustdandy> Reminded me WAY too much of my own dad so thanks pat
[4:06:37] <%castlerock42> Approximately exactly.
[4:06:42] <%Felhad> will it be fun, or will it be *DREADFUL*?

[4:06:46] <%arcadianskypirate> @JustToWatch LUL
[4:06:48] <Vlesh> That's the thing about this game though, it's only 3 hours long, but it stays with you for years.

[4:07:19] <+doc_ock_rokc> Why was this game banned in china. OH YEAH because several leaders are part of that cult

[4:07:24] <%SveriSageAdvice> honestly, i didnt even hear you yelp once
[4:07:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The real spooks is that this sorta stuff happens in real life too
