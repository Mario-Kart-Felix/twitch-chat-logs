[1:37:39] <%otakon17> like just MAKE A TOGGLE
[1:37:39] <+BinaryForest> Let's make a game entirely about a long siege in this series notorious for its terrible sieges

[1:37:42] <SGrim> So just Cavalry?
[1:37:42] <111111sagas111111> The consensus of the TW community and everyone who played the early release agrees that this is shaping up to be a big flop
[1:37:43] <Ipsenscastle> it's such a shame because the Iliad is actually full of rad fantasy shit
[1:37:43] <%sjcodan> This looks lame

[1:37:49] <+Alicitzen> Cant wait for the Mandalore video on it
[1:37:49] <+ragingbrachy> denied horseman cock
[1:37:49] <amiavamp> These are the same people who unironically play Fallout NV on hardcore with one-hit-kill deaths and say it's the only way to play
[1:37:50] <+chase959> are there drunk assholes called satyrs?
[1:37:50] <%Tyndarian> Cosplentaur
[1:37:50] <satans_finest_millennial> someone tell these manlets that Minotaurs are not real
[1:37:52] <The_Maddness> Sounds like a lot of idiots gettign mad about nothing
[1:37:53] <%miguelrod777> they somehow found a way to make everyone mad
[1:37:53] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt To be fair, that's probably where the centaur myth came from
[1:37:53] <srcalavera94> ITS JUST ONE MAP OF TROY

[2:02:12] <TotallyJustBacon> DO YOU SEE
[2:02:12] <+DZiffer> No, they turn themselves into stone, giving them immunity to the next hit as sort of a parry
[2:02:12] <+pixelmike> THIS IS SO WEIRD
[2:02:12] <+CatYamHD> the boss is getting hard to make the player man stun

[2:02:15] <PanicSwytch> Easy mode activate
[2:02:15] <Harthrul> someone tell Diavolo to skip this trailer
[2:02:15] <nomos42> Like who saw this and thought it would get people hyped
[2:02:15] <%Typhaeon> Somewhat more generous than a typical parry
[2:02:15] <+hawk_rush> why no music ResidentSleeper
[2:02:15] <BlkFlameKami> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:02:15] <$KillerKalamari> that combat is annoying to watch
[2:02:16] <%ThePuddingDead> way to break the pacing guys...
[2:02:16] <+MrCJBubba> It looks like a weird super armor mechanic
[2:02:16] <Snookasaurus> looks like shit
[2:02:16] <Griffin1171> Dark Souls but not punishing
[2:02:16] <%Rafferty3231> it's the same stupid moves over and over
[2:02:16] <ravencloak13> Looks like super armor
[2:02:16] <%SovPho> this makes my chest feel heavy
[2:02:16] <WhoManOWL> boy that sure is a video game
[2:02:16] <%PlagueOfGripes> some sort of guarding mechanic
[2:02:17] <laserbeaming> they harden to counter attack
[2:02:17] <%Cozy90> I DONT LIKE THIS MECHANIC
[2:02:17] <%PirateMike_> This looks alright
[2:02:17] <weirdducks> oh it's a parry for the enemy
[2:02:17] <King_Kth> Gonna be real. This looks like shit
[2:02:17] <zamzoph> WHY DID THEY SHOW THIS PART?
[2:02:17] <%DorianCreed> @PatStaresAt Spend green bar, get Dark Souls shield without having to equip a shield
[2:02:18] <ralphfromdk> Slow souls
[2:02:18] <J0j0nes> This is a really weird parry.
[2:02:18] <bluefooddye1> is this elden ring?
[2:02:18] <Coffee_JD> why would you show this
[2:02:18] <redginger666> WAT
[2:02:19] <GarettLefebvre> Like Attack on Titan the hardening is like added armor or blocking
[2:02:19] <+lazysaiyajin> SUPER ARMOR
[2:02:19] <Skoost> wheres music?
[2:02:19] <%derap41> Of this seems to be more like Lords of the Falllen which makes me sad
[2:02:19] <+pixelmike> WHY WAS THAT FAST
[2:02:19] <%UvBenServed> ESTUS
[2:02:19] <+Kduff89> thats freaking cool to parry without an animation actually
[2:02:19] <+MrJadeK> WTF

[2:02:21] <%Ynkubus18> Dark Slows

[2:02:21] <+Rorinator> Snore Souls
[2:02:22] <%SoleilAstier> boring

[2:02:22] <Melchior_the_Wise> sekiro/dark souls kind of
[2:02:23] <+treemanfour> I think it calculates sword location for actual parries
[2:02:23] <JonJonRequiem> Epic can have this one lol
[2:02:23] <rcand9> what a terrible way to show off yer game
[2:02:24] <Jericho717> this needs some boss music
[2:02:24] <+Xraidersama> I love how there's no music
[2:02:24] <Jrockoni> its anti bloodborne
[2:02:25] <pibbleton> The music is nothing but 80's rap.
[2:02:25] <+TheyTookMyBeard> uh
[2:02:25] <+earthboy2k> zzzzz
[2:02:25] <amiavamp> Boss fights are the worst parts of soulsbournes, change my mind

[2:02:26] <%ScrapSentinel> AWKWARD SOULS
[2:02:26] <%zestyArsenic> this fight should be 3 minutes shorter
[2:02:26] <teflonbilly777> That weapon art was cool
[2:02:26] <mostundesired> Why is this one fight taking so long.
[2:02:26] <+ragingbrachy> its dumb

[2:02:32] <%Coystick> This is becoming less interesting by the second
[2:02:32] <+ThisGuyCaleb> It looked interesting. So why show the most boring boss fight in the world.
[2:02:32] <redginger666> COOL MUSIC
[2:02:32] <%Cozy90> BUT WHY THOUGH?
[2:02:32] <jowi_time> its like blocking
[2:02:32] <Nobuwaroo> it's a parry?
[2:02:33] <+arabundo> no explanation and no world to show off
[2:02:33] <+manny2510> Attacks taken while hardened become health
[2:02:33] <TheMorilo> This looks cool

[2:02:36] <TheHairiestHare> The hypest gameplay on Twitch
[2:02:36] <+theKingRamses> it's a block or something
[2:02:36] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Why would you deliberately use a UI that makes people think of a better game that they could lay instead?
[2:02:36] <PeteyMcPickle> I was in before I saw this gameplay

[2:02:37] <+SorryButt> They turn to stone as a block
[2:02:37] <+TechTurtle7> Is it a staus effect for being in the water or something

[3:05:07] <$TheSmerdis> @rcand9 My thoughts on it is the more people that buy P4G the more likely we are to get other Atlus games on pc
[3:05:08] <antyriku2> pat kill then attack
[3:05:08] <%TrafficCohen> Pat why
[3:05:10] <bluefooddye1> ResidentSleeper

[3:05:49] <antyriku2> @DaBigVitus this is pretty ftp
[3:05:50] <%Pompadourius> Maybe if P4G does well we could get, like... P3P on Steam too? Like the other one that REALLY needs a port to something else? Please?
[3:05:51] <+ghostfaceninja_> are the same that burn crosses?
[3:05:51] <%Starotter70> @crowned_martian tbf, like a thousand people left so

[3:13:57] <bleugh> you may not like it but this is what a peak build looks like
[3:14:01] <l33tc4k3> same for any game with denuvo, pat was saying a game is 'out' when it's 1.0 right? for me its when denuvo is removed

[3:18:11] <+Deepfriedcthulhu> they showed off some kind of cool indie games
[3:18:11] <@SoFarFetched> Secret Trailer was GloomWood because they forgot to include it into the show. LUL
[3:18:13] <$hooppawesomeness> thats why i dont like it. by the time you have the juice to use it, theres more important shit out there. just my opinion though!
[3:18:18] <%Pompadourius> If Persona 4 Golden wasn't leaked it would've been a pleasant surprise, but no.
[3:18:19] <BallerSwagBro9k> Wow
[3:18:19] <%Keyd00d> There were some good games, it was alright
[3:18:23] <butthurtdave> We saw a cringe guy in a playboy coat lounge in a chair and talk to a robot for 3 hours so that was .....fun
[3:18:33] <%BubbaRands> Cringe moments and a guest appearance by FUGGINS
[3:18:33] <%optimasmaximas> @SoFarFetched that's so fucking embarrasing for those devs i feel so bad
[3:18:38] <@SoFarFetched> It was pretty much "Oops we forgot a trailer,here you go"
[3:18:39] <%rosemon5001> other than atlas and outlast there wasnt anything anyone cared about
[3:18:40] <SoySocks> P4G would've been a cool surprise if the leaks weren't so strong
[3:18:41] <tactician0> sony has the best one this year so far
[3:18:43] <restingbones> it was an hours long cringefest with some game trailers in between 90% of which looked boring and nothing else.
[3:18:44] <%DappercatEsquire> a very cute gril
[3:18:51] <GrayTheGrayson> pc gamer fried my brain

[3:19:09] <rcand9> what would gmaing events be like without leakers
[3:19:09] <GrayTheGrayson> wasn't there supposed to be a future games thing?
[3:19:10] <%Pompadourius> There was the one guy with that *** website. That was great.
[3:19:18] <SoySocks> @GrayTheGrayson yeah that's in 13 mins
[3:19:20] <%sjcodan> THONK
[3:19:24] <l33tc4k3> the only game i was actually fairly interested in is epic games store exclusive so meh
[3:19:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> There were some interesting games shown, I thought it was more intriguing than the Sony show
[3:19:27] <@SoFarFetched> @optimasmaximas It's okay gloomwood has a link to their steam page by typing in "Notbloodborne" along with the other things for a link LUL
[3:19:29] <butthurtdave> I know it's ranked but god do people take suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuper long to plan out their moves
[3:19:36] <zamzoph> wasted

[3:19:49] <bR4iAn> GG
[3:19:49] <ddosd_by_door> pat u lost the 4/4
[3:19:53] <%Cozy90> the only thing that looked good to me at the PC game show was "SHADOWS OF DOUBT"
[3:19:55] <%Pompadourius> Bloodborne for PC will not happen. lmao
[3:20:17] <+Redtaco98> how long till the next thing?
[3:20:18] <%Aztec50> why not attack with thresh?
[3:20:18] <restingbones> why wouldn't you attack with Thresh again?
[3:20:19] <%optimasmaximas> @SoFarFetched ok, that makes me feel a little bit better LUL
[3:20:21] <zamzoph> why not attack with thresh? LUL
[3:20:23] <+thebackwardslegsman> I'm very confused by this round lol.

[3:20:44] <Zombrocom> Bloodborne pc isn't happening
[3:20:46] <%Pompadourius> I'd LOVE Bloodborne PC to exist. But it's a meme at this point to talk about anything Bloodborne-related.
[3:20:57] <Lophostrix_> @bR4iAn que dice brian
[3:20:58] <%Pompadourius> Whether that be ports or a sequel or anything.

[3:21:16] <Zedimonx5> @pompadourius what about Bloodborne 64?
[3:21:28] <l33tc4k3> ive been thinking recently that sony should release their own PC store but for PS1/2 games with a built in emu etc
[3:21:29] <Aeriz_> Anyone know whats happening at the next show?
[3:21:32] <l33tc4k3> id be all over that shit

[3:21:44] <%Pompadourius> Bloodborne 64 will be okay.
[3:21:45] <Calek> maybe she lagged out
[3:21:47] <+MrJadeK> stalling
[3:21:47] <%Jekado> he's gonna slow play i think
[3:21:50] <+captain_elsewhere> is he creaturefucked ?

[3:21:55] <%Treuan> Streamsniping?

[4:53:03] <%de1ete_forever> lil black slave bbys
[4:53:04] <%moogleboy1984> Josh Grier looks like he wants to eat his brother's skull
[4:53:05] <Garry_Guyface> "Exclusive" and "First Look" have lost all meaning
[4:53:06] <+senfood> Werewolf trailer has no gameplay but it's cooler.
[4:53:08] <%deadsevenvy> Their Dialouge is Schizo because each dev wrote the stuff they wanted for them to say. Kind of.
[4:53:08] <person181> she looks like a fortnite
[4:53:08] <Animeshowfan> they arent showing any new footage ethier
[4:53:08] <magicaki> @PatStaresAt The trailer three days ago was a different Werewolf game.

[4:53:12] <ChokeOnMyChicken> GAME SUX
[4:53:12] <+InkblotBlues> How is it that none of these devs have even half decent mics?
[4:53:13] <Vashido22> this game looks good tbh
[4:53:15] <boardscanada> at least this looks like a game instead of a wannabe movie director making a 'narrative driven story-based' game
[4:53:17] <+09havocworm> This game looks fun
[4:53:18] <+McAngrimStein> Saying it's an "exclusive look" by only flashing the word "EXCLUSIVE" is pretty underhanded
[4:53:18] <%Xevtes> PIXAR SOULS
[4:53:18] <sadboixx420xx> I legit thought they were announcing ANOTHER Werewolf game
[4:53:19] <%Typhaeon> Red means scary
[4:53:19] <%valriot> THIS LOOKS GREAT
[4:53:19] <+GeneralHysterics> audio engineers fucking up, devs are way quieter
[4:53:20] <+Midashu> Bad Nature vs Good Nature

[4:53:21] <%Typhaeon> Also evil
[4:53:21] <dinnydanny777> @tigercatgo Is it actually them because I thought it was but wasn't sure, if so that's wild and I want to see what this is like
[4:53:22] <Guigondi> ember lab made that super good Majora's Mask CG Mini Movie
[4:53:22] <thefixermed> Game looks good
[4:53:22] <+malfion> This was in the sony thing

[4:53:38] <rcand9> its cute
[4:53:38] <+Promessa_EX> their audio is better than most of these guys
[4:53:43] <+CptBritches> Is this really the studio that did the Majora's Mask fan animation???
[4:53:43] <%Rorinator> You could just replace the word "exclusive" with the word "fucking" and lose basically no meaning. "Here's a first fucking look at Kena"
[4:53:44] <+Midashu> Parry the bad wood
[4:53:46] <+tuchpi> BLACKFACE MINIONS LUL
[4:53:46] <Yhoryn> They've shown like the save 5 clips over and over now

[4:53:50] <thefixermed> PARRY
[4:53:52] <+regularjimmy88> This looks pretty neat.
[4:53:53] <+DZiffer> oh my god, that are really just minions
[4:53:53] <amiavamp> I appreciate that this has the feel of an action-adventure from 15 years ago, that genre has kind of died
[4:53:54] <Captain_Doomsday> Leading small creatures around!? This looks good now.
[4:53:54] <OneThousandTomatoes> this presentation is draining my interest
[4:53:55] <+neutralraff> GAMEPLAY FUCKER DO YOU HAVE IT!
[4:53:56] <%Shadicara> So Pikmin

[5:00:30] <gade177> @Ultimatefool ur right what am I saying? Konami 2010 forever!
[5:00:33] <%cowardlord> hey do you guys like survival builders? Here's 20
[5:00:36] <+NitronStreams> remember in these dark times: a dog exists somewhere in the world right now.
[5:00:49] <%RueOrin> RueOrin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Well that was a waste of an afternoon. On the plus side, I played The Gloomwood demo. It's actually rad.
[5:00:49] <amiavamp> I've played multiple survival builders and I can't find a godo one
[5:00:51] <%heartlesshealer> dogs are real
[5:00:52] <Guardiansaiyan> @ChoculaUltra the Era of Boobs is over...the new Era of HIPS is IN!
[5:00:53] <cipher758> @nitronstreams thank u man
[5:00:53] <l33tc4k3> @Promessa_EX no space for big bap game only dog murder took it all up
[5:00:57] <%Captainahab_37> hey do you guys like battle royale? cuz fuck we got it
[5:00:59] <%heartlesshealer> psaJpeg
[5:01:02] <bashful_bard> Was this actually 4 hours?
[5:01:05] <+Pendragwn> @NitronStreams I needed that
[5:01:11] <+Order_of_Mystery> god these shows sucked
[5:01:18] <thefixermed> Hey you guys like Roblox? Check out our FunkoPop game
[5:01:18] <dinnydanny777> I only tuned in like an hour ago and I feel like I wasted an hour
[5:01:21] <+Promessa_EX> @l33tc4k3 dog murder and gay dinosaurs
[5:01:26] <@SoFarFetched> well 5 hour stream now
[5:01:28] <Guardiansaiyan> @dinnydanny777 you did
[5:01:28] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[5:01:34] <%Starotter70> NotLikeThis
[5:01:35] <%Captainahab_37> what's with the gay dinosaur gamw
[5:01:39] <gade177> No furry high school game 0/10.
[5:01:42] <%Captainahab_37> I don't think there was gay dinosaurs
[5:01:47] <+09havocworm> Some of the games shown did look cool but were not advertised well
[5:01:54] <%squintypete226> At least Ubisoft have to decency to make have a feeling
[5:01:57] <DelgotHansto> Go back to Bald Space Men it's better than Plastic Teenage Shootermen
[5:01:57] <+raidermonkey> I don't know why people have high expectations for anything other than the big events. there's still some fun stuff in there, but if you expect massive announcements, you're obviously gonna be let down
[5:01:58] <%Pompadourius> Pompadourius subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! I wish I had King Crimson so I could've seen the results of these game shows and leapt past them.
[5:02:03] <+Promessa_EX> nah they're gay, not that there's anything wrong with that
[5:02:04] <dinnydanny777> I like how they showed a game and then didn't show the game
[5:02:09] <thefixermed> Goodye Volcano High is the gay dino game
[5:02:16] <%Captainahab_37> oh that gamw
[5:02:22] <Guardiansaiyan> @raidermonkey we thought they would learn from their mistakes...we were wrong
[5:02:27] <%xcompleasedad> @thefixermed Gay? Like, for real?
[5:02:29] <@SoFarFetched> I mean look if you can have dinosaurs wearing gothic stuff AND clothing,might as well have the possibility of them being gay.
[5:02:36] <amiavamp> @raidermonkey i think some of us are hoping for innovative (or just fun) indie games, unfortunately the majority of them are...not
[5:02:39] <+raidermonkey> @guardiansaiyan for real
[5:02:40] <Guardiansaiyan> @SoFarFetched truth
[5:02:45] <%squintypete226> Those types of games tend to have THAT specifc artstyle
[5:02:46] <%cowardlord> that werewolf game had a reveal for its reveal trailer
[5:02:48] <%squintypete226> It's weird
[5:02:49] <MadDesperado13> Gay dinos all the way yo
[5:02:49] <+09havocworm> great music
[5:02:53] <+Promessa_EX> they are actually, like the devs said so
[5:02:55] <DelgotHansto> Ah yes, Life in the Woods is Furry
[5:03:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> Every year show are getting worse and worse
[5:03:01] <dinnydanny777> Who knows if Dinosaurs were gay or not
[5:03:02] <thefixermed> Not really gay, just very tumblr
[5:03:08] <Guardiansaiyan> Gay Dinosaurs are PEOPLE TOO
[5:03:09] <%Captainahab_37> So it's a game for scaleys
[5:03:15] <@SoFarFetched> DINOSAURS CAN WEAR CLOTHES AND GO TO SCHOOL TOO
[5:03:23] <%cowardlord> no they're dinosaurs
[5:03:23] <+Promessa_EX> 2020
[5:03:25] <+raidermonkey> @amiavamp yeah, a lot of them aren't, but there also a bunch that I'm definitely gonna keep my eye on, and that's all I really wanted from the shows today
[5:03:28] <%squintypete226> Not for fucking long they can't
[5:03:29] <%Starotter70> Wait, are fish people considered scaleys?
[5:03:29] <%Captainahab_37> I noticed some of the dinosaurs don't have fearhers
[5:03:33] <armchairmaster_> IS THAT DINO THING EVEN A GAME?
[5:03:34] <%Captainahab_37> what's up with that
[5:03:35] <dinnydanny777> Dinosaurs are people too you guys
[5:03:38] <Guardiansaiyan> David Cage Game for 2020? There is still time

[5:11:11] <@ShockzNDrawe> ShockzNDrawe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 18 month streak! P4G is my favorite game of all time. I'm really happy it's more widely available now. Don't think it deserves most of the hate it gets, but that 3 hour intro tho
[5:11:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> This looks REAL good
[5:11:13] <+StrawberryPantsu> VITA MEANS LIFE
[5:11:13] <Klefth> There's no way to emulate P4G
[5:11:13] <boardscanada> @PatStaresAt there are no Vita emulators
[5:11:15] <%de1ete_forever> on the damn vita
[5:11:15] <+Remery_> The Vita did nothing wrong

[5:11:31] <%Pompadourius> P4G is a perfect place to start because you can control your team unlike in P3FES, and you aren't spoiled yet by Persona 5 being incredible graphic and QoL wise.

[5:13:33] <%TheBenson8r> I LOVE YOU KENPACHI RAMASAMA
[5:13:43] <dinnydanny777> Yennefer is kind of a dick to Geralt anyway
[5:13:43] <%D00msDayDan> he's so flippant, yet so desirable
[5:13:44] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> GERALT WAS LITERALLY FUCKING DEAD
[5:13:45] <gade177> awwww
[5:13:45] <+MrTurtleThief> Yennefer is the only choise
[5:13:46] <+Promessa_EX> They should sort of remake p3 tho
[5:13:48] <%de1ete_forever> how can you be so flippant, yet so desirable
[5:13:50] <%optimasmaximas> EVERYONE IN WITCHER WAS A LIAR
[5:13:51] <+EyeFarted> The highlight of the stream was CHILD-ON-ADULT ASS SMACKING
[5:13:55] <startstoprepeat> triss bad yen good
[5:14:01] <%tank7013> Yes Triss and Yen were both garbage
[5:14:01] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Triss is a FUCKING WHORE
[5:14:05] <fuji_92> tris bad
[5:14:06] <dinnydanny777> At the start of Witcher 3 I felt like Yennefer was pretty emotionally abusive
[5:14:08] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> HE LITERALLY DIED IN HER ARMS
[5:14:13] <%crimsonharvest> he was stabbed until like 99% dead cmon lady
[5:14:14] <+Promessa_EX> triss is hotter
[5:14:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> fuck triss
[5:14:17] <bashful_bard> Forced amnesia sex
[5:14:18] <+Solutha> She lost hers too
[5:14:18] <SGrim> Triss is an awful person
[5:14:18] <+TreeeFOX> until he didn't forget.
[5:14:19] <%squintypete226> But it'd still suck for her, though
[5:14:19] <%de1ete_forever> what is pat on aboot?
[5:14:20] <%Mrbaconator> TRISS IS HOTTER
[5:14:20] <zamzoph> he didn't know PepeLaugh
[5:14:20] <+DoctorAvens> Triss is wrong
[5:14:23] <Ezbern> Yennefier is always angry and treats you like shit
[5:14:23] <+Etherealizer> Yen is worst girl. Triss is best girl. fight me, chat.
[5:14:24] <%YakumoYomi> Yennefer is the canonical choice, and Triss is a scumbag for exploiting that. But Triss is hotter, so...
[5:14:25] <BinaryShuffle> Yen is as bitch anyways, fuck her
[5:14:25] <%VashyronM> yennifer is kind of a jealous bitch, but she hot tho
[5:14:25] <%squintypete226> Still hurts to see your man fuck around
[5:14:26] <LordDudeTheFirst> Didn't Triss know though?
[5:14:26] <%trustycoyote> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson Exactly! He was DEAD!
[5:14:26] <+pectusumbra> Okay but think about how many times he *tried* that though
[5:14:26] <%mMayrro> triss is hotter anyway
[5:14:27] <Ipsenscastle> Geralt fucked her once in the books for real while he had his memories lol
[5:14:27] <%XeroSigmaPrime> TRiss is kinda a sloot for doing that tho
[5:14:27] <%ragingbrachy> yes
[5:14:27] <fuji_92> triss is a cool gal EXCEPT
[5:14:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> "who the fuck are you, titty witch?"
[5:14:28] <%cowardlord> screw yenn
[5:14:28] <+MrJadeK> waited 5hrs for some ass slaping
[5:14:29] <+Goku01899> Witcher harem when?
[5:14:29] <Dr_Mooose> it was a break!
[5:14:29] <+lanik745> Yennifer is trash
[5:14:29] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Yen lost her memory too. Letho mentions that in Witcher 2
[5:14:30] <%dekkitout> LuvUok
[5:14:36] <dinnydanny777> Maybe best choice is loner Geralt
[5:14:37] <%marsantas> Yeah but she doesn't know that, the spell to fix memories is easy, TRISS FUCKED YOU OVER
[5:14:42] <%Rumbutt> NOT CHEATING IF YOU'VE GOT AMNESIA oroLUL
[5:14:42] <Zereaux> triss is best girl you scum bags
[5:14:43] <%Yautjabutts> just read the books. Triss is a shit.
[5:14:44] <sadboixx420xx> But Yen doesn't have red hair
[5:14:45] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @PatStaresAt Karens gone wild is currently trending on Twitter
[5:14:49] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt Ross voice: "WE WERE ON A BREAK"
[5:14:51] <londorpaleale> I fucked around after that since she was gonna hold me guilty anyways
[5:14:52] <+Order_of_Mystery> Yen is a terrible person, and an utter bitch.
[5:14:54] <AxelCezar> Yennifer is the toxic gf that will treat you like shit for ever
[5:14:55] <vernardohunk93> also in the books she forces geralt to lover her by making a wish to a genie
[5:14:58] <%YakumoYomi> @XeroSigmaPrime She's "morally grey", because she's hot.
[5:15:00] <fuji_92> TRISS IS COOL, BUT YEN THO
[5:15:04] <%tank7013> @screamlord he also mentions how she immediately tries to fuck them and backstab them
[5:15:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> roach is the best girl.
[5:15:06] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Rad the books, Triss is an ultra scumbag
[5:15:11] <%Yautjabutts> wrong vernardohunk93 - Geralt made the wish
[5:15:11] <%deadsevenvy> If Yen is a terrible person, Triss is the devil
[5:15:14] <+TreeeFOX> yen wasnt bad. triss was just better
[5:15:14] <+Solutha> @vernardohunk93 other way around bud
[5:15:15] <Mr__Jebus> No she doesnt, Geralt is the one that makes that wish
[5:15:16] <+lethallylactic> Turning down Yennefer during the Djinn quest felt sooooo good Kreygasm
[5:15:18] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @YakumoYomi GOD DAMNIT
[5:15:22] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[5:15:26] <ScreamLord> @tank7013 Yup

[5:15:38] <%Starotter70> Oh boy
[5:15:41] <%JumboCrunchies> Turn Based allows for Melee to be a lot more effective, and certain spells are hard as shit to land.
[5:15:42] <ravencloak13> Wow, chat is very split about the Witcher debate
[5:15:43] <dinnydanny777> Yennefer says so many insulting things to Geralt that really got on my nerves
[5:15:43] <Tennochief> What
[5:15:43] <CrazyButtholeBoy69> triss a hoe
[5:15:45] <+SiameseDuck> Crrrring-eh
[5:15:45] <%Yautjabutts> imagine going after Yen and Triss and not going for best girl: Anna Henrietta
[5:15:48] <gade177> ur life is gonna suck more and more enjoy!
[5:15:52] <%maenos2> i dunno i look back at 28 year old me and don't feel a thing
[5:15:52] <+michingmallecho> Tríss did nothing wrong (I didn’t read. I DONT KNOW HOW TO READ #america)
[5:15:54] <%ragingbrachy> HES RIGHT
[5:15:55] <ferretinatux> cringe culture is daed
[5:15:55] <Dr_Mooose> yup
[5:15:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> the only one that's there for Geralt without wanting something is Roach.
[5:15:57] <rytisone> rise and shine cringe master
[5:15:57] <%Aydarkzero> i was made fun of when i was 12...
[5:16:00] <%ElenaManetta> i look at myself in the future
[5:16:01] <karovus> past me is a bitch
[5:16:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> i look back on 3 years ago
[5:16:02] <%de1ete_forever> it gets worse even
[5:16:02] <%ElenaManetta> and go what a whore
[5:16:04] <%DEETRz> yup, looking back at 26 year old me is rough
[5:16:04] <bashful_bard> It will never
[5:16:05] <%WarlockaFlocka> You’re right, Half-Life is cringe
[5:16:05] <%Aydarkzero> like a lot
[5:16:07] <assfordayz> Pat what is this?
[5:16:08] <%deadsevenvy> Bruxa is the only right choice
[5:16:09] <%linSP> time is convoluted
[5:16:09] <faithless_zealot> @PatStaresAt Patrick! You're an ok guy!
[5:16:10] <cipher758> Pat wisdom
[5:16:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> Roach is best girl
[5:16:11] <ChoculaUltra> I'm doing that now with my mid 20s as I approach 30. God I was/am such a fucking tool.
[5:16:12] <fuji_92> ye
[5:16:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> makes sense
[5:16:15] <Dragovus> I disagree
[5:16:18] <j0ustar> big truth.
[5:16:18] <Shiranui24> I hate that time shit
[5:16:22] <%ragingbrachy> hes right NotLikeThis
[5:16:23] <%Aydarkzero> nah
[5:16:23] <Ipsenscastle> yeah
[5:16:24] <%squintypete226> After your mid-20s you stop remembering specific times
[5:16:28] <ravencloak13> Actually felt my younger self was smarter cause he could remember things better and think faster
[5:16:28] <+SiameseDuck> The half life of cringe is longer than the half life of reactor 4 in Chernobyl
[5:16:29] <%Pappajimbo> the internet has made cringe immortal
[5:16:30] <Dragovus> I hate myself for my entire life
[5:16:31] <assfordayz> Why this says Persona 4 GOLDEN on the side bar?
[5:16:31] <%crimsonharvest> Is this why sitcom writers can reuse jokes every 10 years
[5:16:32] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> half of chat isn't listening because they're in the Witcher Waifu War
[5:16:34] <Sp3ctre48> I was a real piece of shit a few years ago so yeah that's true
[5:16:34] <+lethallylactic> FFFFF

[5:16:37] <%Retinolgaming> Shame is a 2010s concept.
[5:16:37] <%Ner234> It's cringe that kills you not age
[5:16:38] <@SoFarFetched> Cheer500 Finished watching Beastars the other day. Then I watched the podcast bit,along with Paige & Plague's talk of it,since I didn't wanna get spoiled on stuff before watching. I also agree with Paige's thoughts on Legom the chicken being a favorite character,but I also really like Dom too (the peafowl) so far. Been thinking of reading the manga to see the rest.
[5:16:38] <fuji_92> FSTEAK
[5:16:39] <+mattrutland> As a 40 yr old, i can confirm 100% accurate
[5:16:40] <%BlueMoonBlues> ffffffffffffffffffffff PERSONA
[5:16:40] <%JumboCrunchies> @PatStaresAt What if I look back at myself 5 years ago and wonder why I stopped being so cool?
[5:16:42] <%DianaTheAscian> that doesn't make sense
[5:16:42] <ravencloak13> Also was stronger apperently and braver
[5:16:43] <%cowardlord> I only hate myself more with time
[5:16:44] <spookysenpai20xx> 19 Y/O me ain't me
[5:16:44] <gade177> I don't even remember being 17.
[5:16:45] <%YakumoYomi> I was born in 1984, Pat. I'm immune to "cringe".
[5:16:46] <cipher758> Time will fuck us. oh no.
[5:16:51] <ChoculaUltra> everything after 21 is one giant smear of time, unable to distinguish year from year

[5:17:18] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Letho mentions at the end of Witcher 2 that Yen ALSO lost her memory and immediately tried to fuck him and his mates to try and manipulate them.
