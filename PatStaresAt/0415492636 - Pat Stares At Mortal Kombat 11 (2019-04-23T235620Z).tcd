[0:20:53] <gorillahandz> I can't wait for chat to tear itself apart over whether Jax end is good or bad
[0:20:54] <hassanico> the ending isn't internally consistent
[0:20:56] <@SSaryn> Let's just say people are mad and leave it at that.
[0:20:56] <RICE02> People getting mad over his ending are fucking idiots
[0:20:56] <%waifoong98> punching Slavery will save them from the Arabs Kappa
[0:20:56] <voodooranger13> doo huh
[0:20:58] <wydamn> MK4 Jax is worst Jax. His robot arms aren't hueg enough.
[0:20:58] <%GohanEgret> it's weird in the context of MK, but people losing their shit makes me weep for humanity
[0:21:00] <%Typhaeon> Yeah, it's goofy, and the people freaking out at it are a bunch of dummies
[0:21:00] <%Kataguro> I mean it's actually bad because it's a lazy writer going Black Man = Slavery and being reductive to Jax's character
[0:21:01] <alexandrecau> like Canada would be all speaking french if I defeated kronika

[0:42:03] <lloyddboy> HOLD ON
[0:42:04] <KazMkII> You mean her CRABS
[0:42:04] <@lewdskeletor13> Only Jade can throw up in his mouth
[0:42:05] <D3rrtyD4n> kotal always getting his ass beat
[0:42:06] <odiemikes> two girls fight over who gets to spit in some pigs mouth
[0:42:06] <%Kataguro> Watch as Jade gets the big push
[0:42:06] <%VioletHeart> Those Jade bugs.
[0:42:06] <%Laecerelius> He has to fight MY uteran bees!
[0:42:07] <%GelatinBoi> apatHoldon
[0:42:07] <%GohanEgret> apatHoldon
[0:42:10] <Ion_Laser> hold on. Hold on. Hold On. HOLD ON
[0:42:11] <joedatuous> jade is in charge
[0:42:13] <SunsetJack> You are immune to projectiles?
[0:42:13] <smegma_sorcerer> why does Kotal get all the crazy girls
[0:42:14] <+PaniniPanzer> oh yeah didn't she have like corn rows straight up in mkx
[0:42:14] <arcaderabbit48> I always thought Kotal was on par with Raiden but I guess not!
[0:42:14] <ScreamingMeat> Why did Jade take so long to throw her glaive?
[0:42:16] <dezik45> Outworks is like seahorses.
[0:42:16] <starotter70> @lewdskeletor13 That's love
[0:42:17] <wydamn> Praise the cube
[0:42:18] <%nitronLVIII> kotal almost got mileena'd
[0:42:19] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @CappuccinoGuil lets be real oviposition would have been hotter then that
[0:42:19] <%Kirby_Sauce> this game feels more like injustice than MK
[0:42:21] <%waifoong98> the flashing looks so bad
[0:42:21] <%Kataguro> Makes your knees explode I guess
[0:42:26] <%Reizie_Etherealm> What's the deal with the giant spider in the background? Is that the rotten vale??
[0:42:29] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @CappuccinoGuil like I don't like either, just saying.
[0:42:29] <alexandrecau> Kotal is on par with kung jin
[0:42:32] <%Tucker0603> I think he's gonna be the one inserting bugs
[0:42:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> Angriest Pat Paused (FACING RIGHT)
[0:42:32] <corepercentlives> just do it perfect
[0:42:32] <%Sxy_T_Rex> Little did she know Kotal was already full of bats thus negating the bugs
[0:42:33] <$cureneckbeard> if every fight is to the death and you fight every character in the singleplayer mode, how does any more than one character ever canonically survive to the next game
[0:42:35] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Youwereeatenbyalid you need Jesus Khrist
[0:42:38] <Daxalog> You can just put moves on the screen for quick reference.
[0:42:38] <arcaderabbit48> @ScreamingMeat She was kinda interested in where things were going, but decided bug mpreg isn't her thing
[0:42:42] <+VektorTroika> that's a unist move
[0:42:48] <MegaXZerolegends> That effect looks horrible
[0:42:49] <Onmi_Khaos> You did not compare the coolest character introduced in MKX to the worst
[0:42:49] <joedatuous> everyone is on par with everyone
[0:42:49] <wydamn> Praise the cube
[0:42:52] <%Kataguro> It's gross and cool
[0:42:52] <mayorrev> lmao the sass
[0:42:53] <+Eclipse_knight_> her bees are the only bugs kotal needs
[0:42:53] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @CappuccinoGuil I mean I do, but that's niether here nor there
[0:42:55] <odiemikes> it didn't line up with her core valuea
[0:42:57] <+secretspud> the stages in this game are some of the best ever in the genre
[0:43:01] <%Laecerelius> I think I murdered shit in here in Diablo 3
[0:43:01] <@lewdskeletor13> @cureneckbeard Characters very rarely fight to the death in canon
[0:43:05] <marvel877> Purple flashing messes with my eyes.
[0:43:06] <%Fenlig> Is that like D'vorahs son back there?
[0:43:08] <Huntercd> D'vorah is still kinda hot despite being a bug
[0:43:16] <dezik45> Pat going to Evo
[0:43:24] <%Kataguro> Gross
[0:43:29] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @lewdskeletor13 then why is it called "mortal kombat?" Should be called something else instead. Like "street fighter"
[0:43:31] <joedatuous> prepare for bug insemination
[0:43:32] <%Niney_Who> KILL HER
[0:43:33] <SunsetJack> What does first hit prop bonus give anyway?
[0:43:33] <leviathan666303> those spider legs are rad
[0:43:34] <odiemikes> see ya at Evo fuckers
[0:43:35] <starotter70> WHAT?
[0:43:37] <%waifoong98> god kill the bug reeeee
[0:43:39] <%Kataguro> Yeah, that seems ot literally be the only reason
[0:43:40] <benjiFG> those bees didn't do shit

[0:43:45] <+secretspud> Mount the world
[0:43:45] <arcaderabbit48> "They're friends"
[0:43:46] <+cvp5127> makes sense
[0:43:46] <%Luvinsus> I don't think that's how that works Pat...
[0:43:47] <LtSergei> she's wearing red
[0:43:48] <+bear_breaker20> OH no waaaaayy
[0:43:48] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> the races cannot mix until the time cube is destoryed
[0:43:48] <%logoth_> Kotal Kahn is just fine?
[0:43:49] <KeiPrime> dvorah jobbing after getting the rub all over MKX

[0:43:55] <Us3rr> Kotol is a hopeless romantic
[0:43:56] <+Uttrik> yeah, that makes sense
[0:43:58] <%Kataguro> Race war?
[0:43:58] <+StrikeTheErf> pat if they weren't the same color they'd have to fight over what color to make their babies
[0:43:59] <Smaenus> I like to think Kotal paints himself green just to impress her
[0:44:00] <@lewdskeletor13> Isn’t Kotal like blueish?
[0:44:00] <%VioletHeart> That's how it works.
[0:44:01] <sponsoredviewer910> Yup, sounds about right.

[0:46:29] <%mormonpizza> this writing LUL
[0:46:29] <SnowCrane> Is this ninja warrior?
[0:46:31] <arcaderabbit48> More than any other fighting game, things happen in such a way to encourage violence. BlazBlue can go an hour before a fight happens. MK can go maybe five minutes
[0:46:32] <flatty1000> I guess they eat the dicks first
[0:46:32] <energywarning> why skin them when it's the crispiest part?
[0:46:32] <Fien111> "Now guys, we all agreed we'd attack them as a group all at once. But how did we attack them?"
[0:46:33] <dekkitout> Man, Predator would LOVE the Takartans

[1:47:24] <joedatuous> she's still always been boring
[1:47:26] <arcaderabbit48> Just because something was bad before, does not justify it being bad now
[1:47:26] <%Remery_> @matrixManipulator His Australian Charms?
[1:47:26] <$SGrim> @matrixManipulator I think Kabal was just looking for excuses, and didn't care who gave them. rooShrug
[1:47:27] <Ion_Laser> @Sphincter_Spelunker and she's script reading
[1:47:28] <Dragon_Batman> She doesn't have her gear and her normals reflect that, neat
[1:47:29] <+BorinCorran> @kingbaconcrispy No, he realized he had Super speed while running to a portal.
[1:47:32] <Onmi_Khaos> I personally believe script reading is exactly as much emotion as I expect with Sonya Blade

[1:48:56] <%ThatGuyfromMars> yeah sonya called his bullshit out
[1:48:56] <Badgerconda_> How stupid do you have to be to cast a washed up MMA fighter as a voice actor?
[1:48:56] <King_Krimzon> The literal worst.
[1:48:56] <Ner234> Oof yeah that doesn't sound great
[1:48:57] <secretbosssauce> This exchange is so awful.
[1:48:57] <Sofa_King_Hype> They should have just gotten Cynthia Rothrock. She would have been 1000x better
[1:48:57] <th3madness> time for great VA vs bad VA
[1:48:57] <+Wiseblood_79> I'd pay for DLC that brings back Tricia Helfer

[2:07:17] <%gimmickypizza> time
[2:07:18] <Onmi_Khaos> Again, Kano threatened Johnny because Sonya had young-kano at death point, and killing Johnny does NOT stop Sonya from killing him.

[2:07:41] <jastrouble97> how would Sonya know that and not johnny
[2:07:42] <Badgerconda_> He has the most generic anime design ever.
[2:07:42] <%C0rdak> Are those shoulder things part of his arms or are they clothes?
[2:07:43] <Run44forrest> remember geras can just freeze time whenever
[2:07:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> You can do it, Ronda Blade!
[2:07:43] <indig0bird> Oh, his skin stitches are cool
[2:07:44] <%Tearonex> big black man = Radical design
[2:07:44] <Onmi_Khaos> Killing Johnny is just spite.
[2:07:44] <$cureneckbeard> Is this guy the announcer?
[2:07:44] <Ratfacepunk> He looks neat, but none of his alt's are interesting
[2:07:45] <CptBritches> He's a fairly boring design overall
[2:07:45] <InugamiTheHound> so he's Gaara from naruto??
[2:07:46] <%mercado94> i have never wanted more to turn off the voices in a videogame before
[2:07:47] <%Laecerelius> I am Pocket Sand made manifest!

[2:07:52] <+HarryWizard> Time hammers
[2:07:53] <arcaderabbit48> Its a good design, I just find it disappointing compared to like, Devora or Erron
[2:07:53] <Nina96> Kronaka is just an angry soccer mom
[2:07:55] <%GohanEgret> @Pandora_Prime i wouldn't go that far, she got good really fast
[2:07:55] <artoflec> there is literally nothing radical about geras
[2:07:56] <%valriot> looks like hes from Omikron

[2:11:04] <zepelinnn> PITTY
[2:11:04] <%rdark_ksu> its very power rangers and its campy

[2:11:24] <+tigerfang86> the SOULNADO
[2:11:25] <fmc009> she was worst than Ronda easily
[2:11:26] <%trnzero> almost a time cube
[2:11:26] <TioXyco> She's worse than Ronda, I can vouche you for that
[2:11:27] <%Prevot> they changed dub studios for this game because of it
[2:11:28] <+w4rhe4rt_> stick it in the time hole
[2:11:31] <fahquit> Im deaf describe rouseys voice to me
[2:11:33] <shotgang86> its so bad that it is abysmal the difference
[2:11:34] <secretbosssauce> I like how even Kronika has heels
[2:11:34] <Zombrocom> This is absolute nonsense
[2:11:36] <%dukenux> Wait, this is just the Ancient One from Doctor Strange
[2:11:37] <LiquidMathew> tbh I don't think Ashly Burch was that great as Cassie either, Erica Lindbeck much better
[2:11:37] <+Magnetoplasmadynamic> God. I love how the WELL OF SOULS is a serious plot point.

[2:11:51] <ExemplarKyle> "Your souls are mine!!"
[2:11:51] <arcaderabbit48> Why did Kronika not appear in the original timeline?
[2:11:51] <Ion_Laser> @fahquit Monotone. Robotic. Devoid of emotion
[2:11:52] <%Bladeexe> I'm on a boat!
[2:11:52] <CptBritches> This story is an absolute fucking mess
[2:11:53] <+BubbaRands> LUL Liu Kang's shit eating grin
[2:11:54] <%gimmickypizza> TIME travel
[2:11:54] <Zombrocom> Kronika: IT WAS ME. I did everything.
[2:11:54] <%Mornaka> @fahquit porn level acting
[2:11:55] <%Niney_Who> JAX
[2:11:56] <+HarryWizard> Soul Nado is the most important thing ever
[2:12:00] <Onmi_Khaos> Hey! The time villain who said she's only doing this because of how RAIDEN fucked this up. Also just said she had Shang Tsung collecting souls so she could do the time thing!
[2:12:02] <SomersaultJustice> those were the days
[2:12:03] <%Mekhet09> Be thankful you are deaf.
[2:12:03] <Onmi_Khaos> Maybe she's lying?
[2:12:05] <fmc009> I will Epitaph so hard when they reach that part about this LUL
[2:12:05] <$cureneckbeard> bearer seek seek lest
[2:12:06] <Badgerconda_> That cube looks pretty sick, but I don't have the fat twitch money Pat does to drop 200 dollars on a fancy lapdesk...
[2:12:06] <ithirstforfreddurst> all in the family, like the korn song PogChamp
[2:12:07] <%Kataguro> I guess Future Jax is just fucking off with the bad guys still?
[2:12:10] <+Personified134> wait why is a deaf person watching a STEAM
[2:12:14] <%C0rdak> It's a stale cold pizza served at five-star buffet
[2:12:14] <fahquit> thats what I like in my pornoes tho
[2:12:14] <jubejube56> @Zombrocom basically described my problem with her
[2:12:15] <+welcometolossantos> @AngriestPat btw Pat have you seen the wokeness of Jax's arcade ending
[2:12:15] <+CanonHusbando> I'd kill to see the behind the scenes of her VO sessions
[2:12:16] <th3madness> all the emotion got beaten out of her in those last two fights
[2:12:16] <$HentaiSenpai9K> RoboRhonda
[2:12:17] <Jetsfantasy> It's pretending to be good
[2:12:17] <ExemplarKyle> It's emotionless. She sounds bored.
[2:12:19] <$vincerocmm> boat
[2:12:20] <+DingusMcFadden> It's un-interested, @AngriestPat
[2:12:20] <gustavozxd> her voice is just a single color screen
[2:12:21] <%Keeble24> I prefer Jax with the beard
[2:12:22] <%mercado94> OH NO
[2:12:23] <%NobleJedi> almost as if she isn't an actor
[2:12:27] <arcaderabbit48> Oh, he just got it
[2:12:27] <LiquidMathew> Ronda's voice acting is so flat that you can almost physically feel her reading the script
[2:12:28] <godzookylives> Why are you even playing this if you don't care that much about MK Pat?
[2:12:29] <mayorrev> Jax is so fuckin cool
[2:12:29] <lel689> kronika is like kaguya from naruto, it was me austin, it was me all along
[2:12:30] <SpaceGuntank> partial deafness?

[2:14:24] <+Hilleltaco> Regardless of how good the actual ending is, I feel like some people are kinda outing themselves with some of the crazy arguments I've seen. Such as "oh so you're gonna erase all the good that slavery did?"

[2:17:54] <Make_me_mad> On the one hand, it is Mortal Kombat. On the other this is for people who are into guro at this point.
[2:17:56] <%mercado94> gaming journalism is a joke
[2:17:56] <mr_slaide> They're game journalists: they're overflowing with soy and feminism.
[2:17:57] <%PipIV> ot cant be as violent as NIGHT TRAP
[2:17:57] <shotgang86> oh man fuck gamesradar
[2:17:58] <%AncelDeLambert> well, it makes it worse to general audiences, can't deny that
[2:17:58] <antonius40k> it's bad because oversensitive bitches
[2:17:58] <HaikuRaichu> It's called Pathetic
[2:17:59] <+StooEsq> GamesRadar apparently not familiar with Mortal Kombat
[2:18:00] <%nitronLVIII> Its so violent it triggers YOUTUBES GORE ALGORITHM
[2:18:00] <Wan6Saber> gaming journalism LU LUL what a joke
[2:18:01] <enfifirever> no shut up tho
[2:18:02] <SpaceGuntank> MK11 is actually banned in japan and a few other places for being too violent
[2:18:06] <%terribleusername> Jax more like Jab
[2:18:06] <%vaporousTippler> Supposedly that was a bad headline. They instead docked it because of the constant cutscene moves mid-fight.
[2:18:07] <%Niney_Who> EX that Grab
[2:18:07] <%Gogogolem> No trigger warning besides the m rating that says uber violence.
[2:18:07] <InugamiTheHound> does jax has Balrog like Dante?
[2:18:07] <Tha_Mik> LUL
[2:18:07] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Gaming Journalism is a joke

[2:18:10] <Daiidalus> Punch
[2:18:11] <%dukenux> MK not being violent is like JOJO not being gay!
[2:18:11] <benjiFG> that was a command grab?
[2:18:11] <%Niney_Who> You have to EX IT
[2:18:12] <+DingusMcFadden> It reminds of that time my parents were ripped in half by a ninja
[2:18:12] <Onmi_Khaos> Not because it's too violent but because I don't care for it.
[2:18:14] <%C0rdak> jab
[2:18:14] <%AncelDeLambert> @nitronLVIII that's hilarious

[2:18:30] <PerrinIsDead> MK is the game that started the ESRB
[2:18:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> Theyre gam jounalists they thought persona songs had the word retarded in there
[2:18:32] <%C0rdak> Why do Jax's hands glow?

[2:18:48] <+PaniniPanzer> I mean the thing with fatalities is that you can just watch them on youtube anyway and most people do for the spectacle, it can still stand on its own as a fighting game and has done so
[2:18:49] <+tigerfang86> you have to IGNITE THE FLAME
[2:18:49] <%C0rdak> Yeah but do they mean anything when they glow more?
[2:18:52] <+tigerfang86> NOW
[2:18:52] <+BorinCorran> Kinda weird this is the one that's too violent. I watched the Fatalities. Nothing has yet to beat Noob in MK9's wishbone fatality.

[2:19:59] <shotgang86> to me, the game got better, the woman now has differemt body times
[2:19:59] <+HarryWizard> Well if Sekiro has shown us anything, its that big anime tiddies are the most important

[2:20:09] <KungFooMaen> Sony Censorship LUL
[2:20:09] <artoflec> because titty offends people more than violence
[2:20:10] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat asking MK to tone down the violence is like asking a Vegan for a hamburger
[2:20:10] <%Prevot> the hood looks awful
[2:20:11] <Joey1995456> Or they could have upped the titty by 2 and up the violence by 2 also, everybody wins
[2:20:11] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> i want less tiddie. they look way cooler with more clothes
[2:20:11] <Darkrenai> i love the core value memes so much

[2:20:14] <+Marvelous_Miscreant> We don’t need titties KappaPride
[2:20:14] <$SGrim> Mortal Kombat's about the violence, not the titty. rooThink

[2:21:19] <$megamonmon123> justice for big titties
[2:21:19] <%QueequegTheater> The real reason is that the yakuza runs Japan and doesn't want Japanese people remembering how much they like to cut people up
[2:21:20] <Onmi_Khaos> that's dumb
[2:21:20] <+SuperRefe> they are more than decent. the face animations are great

[2:27:42] <kingbaconcrispy> @Qwertoqwerto Well, some people think it does. I can understand why. You can dislike the designs but you're also in your right to appreciate them. I think I this point people are just really weary of anything that looks close to it.
[2:27:44] <%mercado94> never
[2:27:45] <Run44forrest> punch
[2:27:45] <ArbyDMC> A rekka command grab?
[2:27:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> what?
[2:27:48] <sappinmahbinyot> @ScreamingMeat increases damage, lest him use missiles, and unlocks a crushing blow ono a ceretain move
[2:27:50] <Joe_Lucis> rip the homie goro
[2:27:51] <%trillmagical> NRS Grapplers a apatWrong
[2:27:51] <fmc009> why no grab?
[2:27:51] <Ion_Laser> @doc_ock_rokc Their Investors because of microtransactions?
[2:27:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @ScreamingMeat Projectile, I think increased damage to throws too
[2:27:53] <%iwa5h4ck3d> Just punch him LUL
[2:27:57] <ArbyDMC> that's weird
[2:27:57] <Rhinoprotoss> Git gudd
[2:27:58] <Onmi_Khaos> Now to be clear
[2:28:01] <alexandrecau> ignit THE FLAME
[2:28:02] <Onmi_Khaos> YOU can't do it reliably
[2:28:02] <%Tearonex> jab jab jab jab jab jab jab
[2:28:03] <Gato_Explosivo> Jax getting his arms woke
[2:28:03] <breakerdsx> Jab->Fatal Move confirmed
[2:28:06] <Tha_Mik> Ignite the flames
[2:28:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @nekodelic apparently not as triggered as their directors around women.
[2:28:07] <%mercado94> LUL
[2:28:09] <Badgerconda_> you've got metal arms. JUST PUNCH HIM.
[2:28:10] <gustavozxd> holy shit some people really angry about that MOGA tweet goddamn this is fucking hilarious
[2:28:10] <Onmi_Khaos> it's not that the controls are bad, it's that you're bad
[2:28:12] <SuperCreeperBlocks> PogChamp
[2:28:12] <ArbyDMC> Bane's commanx grab in Injustice 2 was easy to input
[2:28:17] <fahquit> upcircle blowback flipperkick and you got it
[2:28:19] <%AzureGale> Can Noob still make his opponent puke
[2:28:20] <Dakuu75> story mode is basically just a big tutorial/Lab-time
[2:28:21] <ArbyDMC> and it was the same input
[2:28:22] <%Bladeexe> So Jax is like balrog now with the combo heat up?
[2:28:22] <+McSoliace> it's probably negative edge
[2:28:22] <%Prevot> pat's my favorite pro MK player LUL
[2:28:23] <+Magnetoplasmadynamic> @C0rdak annePoint

[2:28:39] <%nekodelic> @doc_ock_rokc dunno, you're the only one complaining because you can't masturbate to poligons
[2:28:40] <antonius40k> @gustavozxd it is hilarious I keep it going just so I can feed off of their out of proportion rage
[2:28:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> OOOOOOOO

[2:28:44] <Rhinoprotoss> BIONIC ARMM
[2:28:45] <hassanico> @valriot @doc_ock_rokc I think the worst part about this is the people jacking themselves over others being upset when they don't even like any of the previous games in the first place
[2:28:45] <$cureneckbeard> Why do his arms not melt
[2:28:45] <Dr_Mooose> gottem

[2:28:49] <%claudesavegely> the past Noob saibot should just be completely black
[2:28:51] <Darkrenai> @AngriestPat So is this a younger version of Jax? Just got here
[2:28:52] <+Qwertoqwerto> @kingbaconcrispy I wonder why people are leary of something that vaguely looks Muslim. Hmmm.
[2:28:53] <%mercado94> why do americans get so pissy about politics?
[2:28:54] <BaronBlackwood> No like one of the most prolific FGC players is a black and gay (and a fury)

[2:31:25] <@Fuggins4U> Paige, each sperm isn't a completely different person.
[2:31:25] <%trillmagical> Why doesn't Jax just shoot himself to stop himself????
[2:31:25] <%snow_bush> To be fair, so long as younger Jax doesn't get his balls crushed, Jaqui will still be ther.e
[2:31:26] <+StooEsq> Paige, asking the hard questions so no one else has to.
[2:31:26] <+miguelrod777> LAST STARDUST
[2:31:27] <%SirGO0SE> DA NUT
[2:31:27] <Cymen90> THEN DO THE GRAB
[2:31:27] <jubejube56> okay so based off previous rules, younger jax should always win because any damage he takes hurts older jax too
[2:31:28] <+PR0MAN1> Paige with the big thonk

[2:31:30] <ParadoxDreams> The nut grab?
[2:31:30] <%MoraMiarty> @AngriestPat wait by the kano logic, isn't future jax just hurting himself in the present
[2:31:30] <+ssulcer> JUDGEMENT NUT LEVEL 5
[2:31:30] <+PaniniPanzer> there are many nuts like this nut but this nut is mine
[2:31:30] <%terribleusername> this jax knows how to use his moves LUL
[2:31:30] <+CanonHusbando> that's not how nut works in this universe, his first kid is always gonna be jaqui because destiny
[2:31:31] <%spiritofmojave> Are nuts a universal constant
[2:31:32] <%SirGO0SE> judgement NUT
[2:31:32] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> JUDGEMENT NUTTO

[2:31:37] <$Totally_not_toby> shouldn't they both be taking each others' damage?
[2:31:38] <doggieo> Shouldnt punching him cause damage to his future self at the same time like kano
[2:31:38] <SovPho> with my NUT
[2:31:38] <pmtriox> The difference still remains that if past future Jax kills past Jax, all this didn't happen
[2:31:39] <%dukenux> BUST ZA NUTTO
[2:31:40] <+rorschachsjournal505> Paige that’s not how that works
[2:31:40] <Gato_Explosivo> I mean Old Kano died when Young Kano was shot. Why wouldn't Old Jax get hurt when hitting himself?
[2:31:41] <CptBritches> Hurting him should be damaging you. There is no consistency to these "rules"
[2:31:42] <+Answer_Moose> You need to punch more Pat
[2:31:42] <DracaenaLeaf> because future you
[2:31:42] <T_Sasquatch> GOTCHA
[2:31:42] <%kitkat668> wait neither can kill the other here

[2:31:55] <gustavozxd> @AngriestPat don't you start talking about time travel incest
[2:31:56] <bearwagon> ud think arguing semantics gets old for some ppl but i guess it doesnt
[2:31:59] <alexandrecau> gimme fifty
[2:32:00] <%Freelance7> Wait, so who won?
[2:32:00] <ExemplarKyle> Time travel stuff like this is completely messed up. If the two people don't fuck and nut at the EXACT moment they're supposed to, the kid would be completely different.
[2:32:03] <%Aztec50> that JUMP
[2:32:03] <breakerdsx> Coulda had a V8
[2:32:04] <kingbaconcrispy> I like how inconsistent they are with the damage time travel
[2:32:05] <%Hammerknife> wait, is MK armageddon canon to mk11
[2:32:07] <+miguelrod777> Just because you're right dosent mean you are correct
[2:32:07] <%Birdigalore> That jump looked ridiculous lol
[2:32:07] <%Keeble24> GIMME FIDDY
[2:32:07] <+VektorTroika> Do Kombo, TJ Kombo
[2:32:07] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Freelance7 young jax
[2:32:08] <+Wiseblood_79> I imagine it's super easy to do pushups with robot arms
[2:32:09] <HaikuRaichu> Wait shouldn't this hurt Past jax as well?
[2:32:09] <Darkrenai> Your Jax vs the Jax she tells you not to worry about
[2:32:12] <$SGrim> 50's not even hard rooKek
[2:32:13] <+moondog_> mark nut?
[2:32:14] <benjiFG> that's orange
[2:32:14] <hassanico> @doc_ock_rokc I gotta say you manage to attract the worst kinda trolls
[2:32:16] <SheefEatsBeef> wait if this jax kills young jax then daughter die????
[2:32:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> What is Jacqui is her own mother
[2:32:20] <%PipIV> I can hardly give 20
[2:32:20] <%PlumpPotatoRump> "red"
[2:32:22] <D3rrtyD4n> this fight should be possible, they are hitting themselves
[2:32:22] <th3madness> how is future jax even close to winning this
[2:32:23] <SheefEatsBeef> why would he fight??
[2:32:23] <+miguelrod777> archer vs shirou
[2:32:26] <%Freelance7> @ThatGuyfromMars I was joking, but I appreciate the honest answer.
[2:32:27] <%spiritofmojave> @HaikuRaichu I was thinking the same, this is kinda silly LUL
[2:32:28] <+Krivvan> well I mean any injuries would heal up, so as long as he doesn't kill past jax
[2:32:29] <Ultimatefool> @ExemplarKyle No it's fine
[2:32:33] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Freelance7 oh, sorry
[2:32:33] <InugamiTheHound> @moondog_ MARK Nut!!-Gavin
[2:32:35] <D3rrtyD4n> shouldnt*
[2:32:36] <+RustyRacoon98> stop trying to do it
[2:32:36] <Darkrenai> If Older Jax kills himself here doesnt that mean he just dies
[2:32:36] <%QueequegTheater> I like Sonya's voice because the monotone makes my brain feel comfortable
[2:32:37] <+C24U> STOP HITTING YOURSELF
[2:32:38] <BritishTyrannosaur> Netherrealm are messing with Nut's they don't understand
[2:32:38] <ArbyDMC> Try afterwards
[2:32:39] <sponsoredviewer910> Max did kombo, why can't you do kombo?
[2:32:39] <Wan6Saber> wow
[2:32:40] <Dr_Mooose> shouldn't this hurt him?
[2:32:41] <Sloavon> @Hammerknife yes no
[2:32:41] <+Krivvan> I say as he shoots him in the head
[2:32:42] <%Freelance7> @ThatGuyfromMars Nah man, you're cool.
[2:32:43] <%Aztec50> if anything future jax should be taking damage when he hits past jax
[2:32:44] <%dukenux> See the problem with time travel erasure, is that your dad can't just in your mom. He needs to blow THE EXACT load you were in1
[2:32:44] <%Gogogolem> Fun fact men make new semen every 64 days so its a larger window then you'd think
[2:32:44] <$Brother_Coduss> @Hammerknife Armageddon was the reason raiden sent visions to MK9 raiden that led to everything getting fucked up
[2:32:45] <%Laecerelius> Just stop trying and kill this guy
[2:32:45] <+Qwertoqwerto> @HaikuRaichu Why would hurting future hurt past?
[2:32:46] <+BorinCorran> @ExemplarKyle Honestly, that's not even a guarantee.
[2:32:47] <asd2897> wake up super
[2:32:47] <%snow_bush> And then Jax died twice.

[2:32:52] <%Kataguro> @Darkrenai Don't worry about it
[2:32:53] <ScreamingMeat> Shouldn't Old Jax also know what Young Jax knows? Shouldn't he remember what his daughter told young him?
[2:32:54] <alcoholicstpmom> wouldn't all this damage be done to himself
[2:32:55] <Dehlome> that fatal blow is pretty sweet
[2:32:55] <%Kataguro> Shoot yourself
[2:32:56] <%GohanEgret> apatPorgmo
[2:32:57] <%AncelDeLambert> a lot of these moves, having cyborg arms wouldn't actually help, because the move gets its momentum from the back muscles
[2:32:59] <HaikuRaichu> @Qwertoqwerto I meant past his future
[2:33:00] <%Kataguro> Like Johnny Joestar would've done

[2:38:25] <+Magnetoplasmadynamic> Driving part time for Postmates. Gotta make some cash.
[2:38:26] <%Freelance7> Has there ever been a GOOD fighting game story?
[2:38:26] <+governmentmass> future jax is unironically doing things for the better good
[2:38:27] <+Sendaar> She was literally about to kill his daughter and he's like "Oh yeah no this is fine"
[2:38:27] <$shurtal> They're giving each other handies int he Kombat Kave
[2:38:28] <th3madness> we just got through the last time
[2:38:28] <%castcode> Jax really the odd man out in this squad
[2:38:29] <%spiritofmojave> Pre-judgement nut Jax is my new dad
[2:38:29] <hassanico> this crown is the dumbest looking thing ever
[2:38:30] <kingbaconcrispy> They wanted too but it was supposed to be an infiltration mission
[2:38:31] <KeiPrime> she got a freeza head
[2:38:32] <$Totally_not_toby> JAXing off? ehhhhhh??
[2:38:34] <HaikuRaichu> Jax did EVERYTHING WRONG
[2:38:34] <+Walopoh> standing around, singing songs and shit
[2:38:34] <+McSnazzyPants> god i hate kronika's design
[2:38:34] <+zaworldo> WAIT SO ARE these the GOOD GUYS?
[2:38:34] <nymshalo> this story is too crazy for this level of serious
[2:38:35] <D3rrtyD4n> new hat :)
[2:38:38] <Sloavon> Jax is worse than Griffith and Gambino
[2:38:40] <+zaworldo> WHO IS THE GOOD GUYS
[2:38:40] <%galaxyswirl> so am i to understand that whole sequence was pointless
[2:38:41] <alexandrecau> Now to kill everyone
[2:38:42] <+TomServal> @t_sasquatch He's two T-Rex arms on his lower back. They're difficult to see but he has'em. 6 arms but FAR from the beef arms of Goron.
[2:38:42] <hassanico> Kronika already looked bad but with the crown she looks even dumber
[2:38:43] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat Jax is killing your current daughter so that you can have the daughter you want instead
[2:38:44] <+HarryWizard> DId the time villain really need to have a time pun for a name by the way?
[2:38:46] <Sedrelic> look at those ayatan sculptures
[2:38:47] <Onmi_Khaos> did you SEE THAT SMUG SMIRK?!
[2:38:47] <ameraaaaaa> btw what's going on story wise
[2:38:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> The mystical power gubbin
[2:38:48] <Run44forrest> this room looks really evil
[2:38:48] <Dakuu75> Kronika is WHITE AS PAPER
[2:38:48] <+TomServal> Er Goro.
[2:38:50] <silverira> man... Kronica design sucks
[2:38:51] <VJdarkworld> pretty background
[2:38:53] <BabyNaBackbrace> Do you guys prefer gory MK stuff or fighting moves that look insanely painful?
[2:38:55] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Cetrion looks older than Cronika
[2:38:55] <+madeleine334> who do I root for?
[2:38:55] <%mercado94> "are these villains?"
[2:38:56] <RollCritFail> "I hate that you have become a strong, confident badass soldier saving the world from evil" - Old Man "Worse Father of the Forever" Jax
[2:38:57] <+PaniniPanzer> oh this is a cool stage
[2:38:58] <alexandrecau> Like kronika promised shao khan to take over the world
[2:39:03] <%GoldeNOVA> She looks so fucking stupid
[2:39:04] <Blackscience91> This Kami Dogu is stupid
[2:39:04] <%AzureGale> Deliverance? Is Fire Emblem Gaiden crossing over?
[2:39:05] <%Dead_Pal_VeeGeeZee> Man.
[2:39:06] <sappinmahbinyot> :)
[2:39:07] <HaikuRaichu> His current daughter may not be born because it could be a DIFFERENT NUT
[2:39:08] <%Dead_Pal_VeeGeeZee> Jax Sucks.
[2:39:09] <%mercado94> welp
[2:39:10] <+DingusMcFadden> The arcade ending makes more sense now that I'm aware of the Elder Jax character. Obviously that's his ending.
[2:39:10] <+Ryallen> So what does the crown do?
[2:39:10] <hassanico> look at her dumb head!
[2:39:11] <asd2897> put on the cerbero
[2:39:11] <%Kataguro> This villain sucks
[2:39:12] <%AncelDeLambert> her fingers look like she's been huffing paint
[2:39:13] <+HarryWizard> She put it there
[2:39:13] <%averyoddjew> she put it there
[2:39:14] <+w4rhe4rt_> SPOOOOKY GREEEEN
[2:39:14] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> because......
[2:39:14] <coreybom> I just got out conversation with a real racist prick. It was quite interesting.
[2:39:15] <D3rrtyD4n> she put it there to get charged
[2:39:15] <Valsera> she put it there
[2:39:15] <DIOandTheWorld> Because plot
[2:39:15] <KeiPrime> she wanted to put souls in it
[2:39:15] <sdbzdb> I hope kronica ends up super right and fixes all the dumb stuff
[2:39:15] <%spiritofmojave> Now she's radiating fart gas D:
[2:39:16] <%MoraMiarty> pat pay attention
[2:39:16] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat she put it there
[2:39:16] <%snow_bush> It was at this moment that Jax realized he FUCKED UP
[2:39:17] <+xx123manxx> kroinka is the worst MK character ever
[2:39:18] <%MrBorisMakarov> shut up its fine
[2:39:18] <+Magnetoplasmadynamic> Wow this is dumb.
[2:39:18] <%omegasis> didn't she leave it there to get the souls
[2:39:18] <Onmi_Khaos> Pat she fucking told you!
[2:39:18] <zepelinnn> CAILOU BLANCO
[2:39:19] <%Mekhet09> She put it there.
[2:39:19] <%QueequegTheater> They put it there and charged it in the Well
[2:39:19] <Caidezes> She put it there.
[2:39:20] <+Answer_Moose> I think she put it there Pat
[2:39:20] <%Birdigalore> So we're gonna murder future Jax once this is all over, right!?
[2:39:20] <DraxTD> Cause @AngriestPat
[2:39:20] <%valriot> LUL NEW HAT
[2:39:20] <Sloavon> Kronika going for a bike ride
[2:39:21] <+PR0MAN1> Because plot
[2:39:22] <rytisone> reasons
[2:39:22] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Wait, if she can control time, why does she even need to have an army?
[2:39:22] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat THEY EXPLAINED THIS
[2:39:22] <bearwagon> its rewind time
[2:39:22] <$Totally_not_toby> FART GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS
[2:39:23] <+VektorTroika> it was all according to PLAN
[2:39:23] <%galaxyswirl> she said she left it there @AngriestPat
[2:39:24] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat she made shang tsung horde souls in case this happened
[2:39:24] <antshadow14> fart crown
[2:39:25] <%Kirby_Sauce> She said she put it there
[2:39:25] <riotshark> she said she left it there for this reason
[2:39:25] <KeiPrime> IT DID COME up
[2:39:25] <D3rrtyD4n> crazy talk
[2:39:25] <Zombrocom> This is so stupid
[2:39:26] <%Freelance7> Why is her crown green? It doesn't fit with her color scheme
[2:39:26] <$cureneckbeard> It would be funnier if they called them Evil Kitana and Evil Liu Kang
[2:39:27] <RICE02> They brought the crown there
[2:39:27] <Daiidalus> Gift
[2:39:27] <+zaworldo> BIG NEW HAT
[2:39:27] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> She was using the soul well to charge it
[2:39:27] <riotshark> in a past cutscene
[2:39:28] <KingOfTheGeats> he was her back up plan
[2:39:28] <+SuperRefe> she put it there for the souls
[2:39:28] <+linSP> shinook 2
[2:39:28] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat you were too busy shooting gamer goo to pay attention to the story
[2:39:29] <volraths_bane> She put it there to charge it
[2:39:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> It made Ermac?
[2:39:30] <%castcode> too close monkaS
[2:39:31] <hassanico> SHe looks soooooo dumb
[2:39:32] <%GohanEgret> and now a stroll
[2:39:32] <Dakuu75> it didn't alwayse. she put it there recently to get soul-recharged
[2:39:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> iunno
[2:39:34] <CptBritches> Because the writers wanted you to go back to the island because I KLAPPED when I saw the thing! @AngriestPat
[2:39:34] <$SGrim> Her design is significantly improved by the crown woopsPog
[2:39:34] <breakerdsx> She needs some chapstick
[2:39:35] <%Kataguro> Why didn't she just teleport down there and grab it herself?
[2:39:36] <+madeleine334> freaky looking lips
[2:39:37] <gustavozxd> @BabyNaBackbrace whichever looks cooler, like actually stylish and not just uncofortable
[2:39:37] <%mercado94> oh god no
[2:39:38] <Yeajow> She wanted the soul gas
[2:39:38] <HaikuRaichu> Kronika wanted Shao Kahn to win in Armaggedon apparently
[2:39:39] <$cureneckbeard> Bearer Seek Seek Lest
[2:39:40] <%QueequegTheater> apatBig Brain Pat
[2:39:41] <Gato_Explosivo> She just borrowed Shang Tsung's charging station

[2:39:44] <LiquidMathew> "Old Jax fucked everything up"
[2:39:44] <+BorinCorran> Raiden is busy being a waste of space.
[2:39:45] <bearwagon> Raiden u useless motherfucker
[2:39:45] <%VioletHeart> Yeah the crown looks tons better than without it.
[2:39:45] <BreakTheBarrier> Raiden sounds like a fucking robot
[2:39:46] <Onmi_Khaos> @AngriestPat She said that she made Shang Tsung do it from the start so she would have the power to do the time reset
[2:39:46] <StormKingLD> pat you only have about an hour left
[2:39:46] <%AzureGale> Kronika grew to level 10000
[2:39:48] <%matrixManipulator> Kronika got a new SPACE HAT
[2:39:50] <AmericanaRed> Thanks raiden
[2:39:51] <%spiritofmojave> Fire Garden looks like a nice place to do apatBig nothing
[2:39:51] <Onmi_Khaos> Almost like she always planned to do it?
[2:39:53] <RollCritFail> Pretty on the nose, them calling it the "New Era" (aka them rewriting the canon)
[2:39:54] <$SGrim> woopsYes

[2:39:57] <$cureneckbeard> Meanwhile, back in Sekiro
[2:39:58] <%ThatGuyfromMars> no way
[2:39:58] <cowardlord> Maybe should have sent the God to get the crown

[2:45:12] <+HarryWizard> WEHH Kronika told me a thing and I bewieved her!!!
[2:45:13] <+Ryallen> A younger version of a former villain is an asshole? Color me surprised

[2:45:13] <T_Sasquatch> REKT

[2:45:27] <Admiral_PopnFresh> oooh boy that sword choreography
[2:45:28] <%QueequegTheater> @Run44forrest He's not trying to kill him
[2:45:29] <riotshark> I mean it IS older him so of course he'd know his own tricks
[2:45:30] <alexandrecau> she won'T
[2:45:31] <Tomrin> Dad Scorpion > Clone Scorpion
[2:45:34] <%Kataguro> I wish Takeda was here to prove him wrong
[2:45:34] <%Dead_Pal_VeeGeeZee> This fight might be a one sided fight, one person CAN kill the other
[2:45:36] <%GohanEgret> QUI GON CHI
[2:45:38] <CptBritches> He's fucking immune to fire. They already showed that earlier in THIS STORY
[2:45:38] <Dr_Mooose> truth
[2:45:39] <%Birdigalore> Kronika is makin a hell of a lot of Trump promises
[2:45:41] <alexandrecau> she promised that to everyone
[2:45:44] <joneworldbeater> Ralph 1 was pretty good. By all accounts the sequel was spicy diarrhoea ass
[2:45:45] <Ratfacepunk> really thats what he wants
[2:45:46] <+StooEsq> you guys are REALLY trusting of Kronika, huh
[2:45:47] <Rusty619> new era the term of the game
[2:45:48] <GurrenPrime> takeda is engaged to jacqui
[2:45:50] <Ratfacepunk> not his murdered family
[2:45:50] <KeiPrime> kronika is a true politician
[2:45:51] <+frugglemeister> YEAH NINJA INCEST
[2:45:52] <Onmi_Khaos> So she's going to revive the Shirai Ryu, but also the Lin Kuei
[2:45:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> gotta kill Lovecraft gods to end fate
[2:45:53] <+Walopoh> I already know all my tricks, dude
[2:45:53] <GurrenPrime> gettin them robo arm ninjas soon
[2:45:55] <+McSnazzyPants> man, old scorp looks fantastic
[2:45:55] <%unclekulikov> Remember the live action tv show of this fucking game?
[2:45:56] <Ratfacepunk> not his wife
[2:45:56] <%deviljhojho94> scorpion just listen to your well adjusted future self you fucking idiot
[2:45:57] <InugamiTheHound> Naruto fight with those kana blades!
[2:45:57] <%QueequegTheater> Nincest
[2:45:58] <Onmi_Khaos> Despite the two being deep hated enemies
[2:45:59] <pmtriox> but future Scorpion...rage is the entire point of your character
[2:46:02] <%manwithboxonhead> I have no idea what is happening...
[2:46:04] <InugamiTheHound> Kunai blades
[2:46:05] <Onmi_Khaos> but also she's going to give Noob his OWN clan
[2:46:05] <+TomServal> It's his own fire, it's like, punching yourself in the face. Buy fire.
[2:46:05] <alexandrecau> like she did brought the tarkatann but that's it
[2:46:06] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Family family family
[2:46:07] <%vivinxs> but what happens if scorpion kills scorpion with the time magic happening
[2:46:07] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> So this is Ed Boon's dream come true, right?
[2:46:07] <+w4rhe4rt_> USE THE STAR FISH
[2:46:08] <yourliteraldog> OGGA BOOGA
[2:46:10] <Gato_Explosivo> Shouldn't you be hurting yourself when hitting young scorp?
[2:46:11] <+C24U> Do Combo
[2:46:13] <Onmi_Khaos> AND make the Black Dragon the strongest force in the world
[2:46:15] <Wan6Saber> holy shit
[2:46:16] <%QueequegTheater> WALK IT OFF
[2:46:17] <takiyami> yeah, do combo
[2:46:18] <D3rrtyD4n> he has a thing for eyes
[2:46:19] <+PR0MAN1> Were the Shirai Ryu the Mcpoyles of ninjas?
[2:46:19] <Onmi_Khaos> BUT give Shao Khan his own empire
[2:46:19] <T_Sasquatch> it's almost like kronika is a liar
[2:46:20] <+redstonej> which one do I shoot
[2:46:20] <%GoldeNOVA> So why don't you also lose health when you hit him?
[2:46:20] <+frugglemeister> mortal kombat is about family
[2:46:20] <LiquidMathew> I still love sad scorpion when he rage killed Bi-Han and sheepishly showed off the spine
[2:46:21] <%Bladeexe> Sounds like Kronika promised everyone what they wanted and will most likely not deliver on one of them.
[2:46:22] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> The trend of Hot Middle Age Videogame Dads continues
[2:46:23] <%Birdigalore> Ed Boon splooshing all over my screen right now
[2:46:23] <+Ryallen> Because magic
[2:46:23] <%rdark_ksu> Paige still have a pulse?
[2:46:24] <worldbrand> he got better
[2:46:24] <Ion_Laser> RuB SOME DIRT ON IT
[2:46:25] <yourliteraldog> Where the the fatalties at
[2:46:25] <+CanonHusbando> it's just your eyes
[2:46:26] <Wan6Saber> athS kiaaLK
[2:46:26] <%terribleusername> he walks it off
[2:46:27] <Fien111> ninja magic
[2:46:27] <PerrinIsDead> New Era sounds like a 90's wrestling arc
[2:46:28] <Bogart4321> sands of time
[2:46:28] <$cureneckbeard> he got better
[2:46:29] <volraths_bane> yeah, Kronika is just promising everyone what they want to hear.
[2:46:31] <%manwithboxonhead> Ow
[2:46:31] <$Brother_Coduss> all she's really said is she's getting rid of raiden. people just blame him for everything so they just assume everything will be great for them
[2:46:31] <BanSenpai> Its weird for scorpion arcade mode, might be a hint to the next games
[2:46:32] <+Walopoh> "non-fatal"
[2:46:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I can't believe Scorpion's fucking alive
[2:46:34] <%Hilleltaco> @manwithboxonhead Weird time shit apatLiz
[2:46:35] <$SGrim> Eye see woopsYes
[2:46:35] <energywarning> i miss friendshiip
[2:46:36] <%supersugoisenpai1> Tis a flesh wound
[2:46:36] <pmtriox> tis but a scratch
[2:46:37] <Dragon_Batman> Because it's a gameplay thing that is just for show
[2:46:39] <%nitronLVIII> its called a "FATAL" blow
[2:46:39] <%kitkat668> what does a fatality look like then lol
[2:46:41] <%manwithboxonhead> ‘‘Tis just a scratch
[2:46:41] <gustavozxd> losing after mercy OMEGALUL
[2:46:41] <%Remery_> There's Quitality @AngriestPat
[2:46:41] <nymshalo> those midfight fatalities
[2:46:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> Non-canon :D
[2:46:44] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> These fatal blows are really distracting. You see people's eyes get blown out and then they stand up and kill you back
[2:46:45] <kerotuyu> Get him with the starfish!
[2:46:48] <%deviljhojho94> shitheel move
[2:46:51] <LiquidMathew> it apparently can lead to special fatalies
[2:46:51] <RollCritFail> I like how OG/Young Scorpion is so full of rage, whereas Old Scorpion is Ludicrously calm and composed
[2:46:55] <%PlumpPotatoRump> how do u mercy?
[2:46:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> get frieza'd
[2:46:57] <Admiral_PopnFresh> That's actually amazing
[2:46:57] <D3rrtyD4n> i wanna see that in a tourney
[2:46:59] <Onmi_Khaos> And, despite her claiming that she is only doing this because Raiden fucked up, she had this planned from the beginning because she had Shang Tsung collecting souls!
[2:47:00] <%Mekhet09> Time for sadness
[2:47:00] <mankeyfight> your body is still intact
[2:47:07] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @RollCritFail he mellowed out after getting his revenge
[2:47:07] <$cureneckbeard> big cube
[2:47:14] <%SirGO0SE> the chastity cube empowers your gamer skills
[2:47:18] <+TomServal> @plumppotatorump It's literally teabag and button.
[2:47:18] <yourliteraldog> Its okay the knifes are made of nerf
[2:47:19] <StormKingLD> remember pat the rules don't apply to everyone
[2:47:20] <%Keeble24> use the environmentals Pat
[2:47:21] <benjiFG> my family family family
[2:47:21] <+DingusMcFadden> I enjoy your level of goodness, Pat

[2:47:23] <Onmi_Khaos> I think Big Lies are going on
[2:47:24] <D3rrtyD4n> i think its L2 down down for mercy
[2:47:24] <gustavozxd> and to do mercy you HAVE to tea bag, it's the actual command for it
[2:47:24] <Ratfacepunk> yeah exactly

[2:47:26] <+Deano8817> D:
[2:47:27] <CptBritches> This story feels like a high schooler wrote the details and logic connecting the scenes

[2:47:36] <oAznoUta> they had no will to fight?
[2:47:38] <LiquidMathew> They did come back as zombies that one time i think
[2:47:39] <Rhinoprotoss> Mortal Kombat was really about family family family...
[2:47:40] <$cureneckbeard> his son is satoshi nakamoto
[2:47:40] <+Fynale> cuz Quan Chi only brought back fighters
[2:47:40] <$vincerocmm> i was hoping you were gonna say friend ships back
[2:47:41] <KruelDestiny> What is this cube? D:
[2:47:42] <D3rrtyD4n> or down down L2
[2:47:42] <alexandrecau> Quan chi didn'T want to

[2:47:46] <+Ryallen> No reason
[2:47:48] <+Ryallen> Just not everyone
[2:47:52] <+StooEsq> Family...(family...family...)
[2:47:53] <haveswordmuststing> kill the past at it's most literal
[2:47:53] <alwayspronking> LUL
[2:47:57] <Tomrin> I don't remember Shinnok having anything to do with the death of his clan
[2:47:59] <+frugglemeister> Then Scorpion could be bill Cosby ghost dad
[2:47:59] <%castcode> !
[2:48:00] <%ThatGuyfromMars> man good guy scorpion talking down his old evil self is really well done
[2:48:00] <coreybom> cause it's Quan chi
[2:48:00] <%deviljhojho94> PogChamp
[2:48:01] <CptBritches> Because the plot says that they can't be revived because the plot
[2:48:02] <%Dead_Pal_VeeGeeZee> T_T
[2:48:02] <jubejube56> time for what I feel was the most pointless decision

[2:51:12] <+l0rd_anoos> If Scorpion wold've said like 10 more words they wou;dn't have to fight
[2:51:13] <enfifirever> DON'T QUESTIONS IT

[2:51:24] <+VektorTroika> Sub-Zero caught Scorpion's stupid
[2:51:25] <Magicferret> They must fight to show their feelings for each other.
[2:51:26] <%Keeble24> no time for talks
[2:51:26] <%deviljhojho94> But thats why we love it!
[2:51:26] <HaikuRaichu> Woolie's Stand [JUST TALK]
[2:51:26] <%dukenux> Why would they fight in a MK game? Kappa
[2:51:30] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I mean, I'd certainly listen to my future self if I came back in time to stop telling me to act like an asshole
[2:51:33] <%galaxyswirl> i love how scorpion is the MOST together character
[2:51:33] <Vicemond> at least it doesn't have a blood dagger
[2:51:33] <CptBritches> This game's story feels way stupider than the past 2 games tbh
[2:51:34] <+xx123manxx> Still manages to be the best story in any fighter ever LUL
[2:51:35] <@lewdskeletor13> ITS GREAT SHUT UP
[2:51:35] <+Ryallen> One his eyes have been stabbed out and his spine removed only then will they be willing to talk
[2:51:37] <%Hammerknife> the MK storyline is better than anything in the Souls series
[2:51:38] <T_Sasquatch> sub zero has literally spent his entire life fighting this Jack ass, why would he trust him
[2:51:38] <KeiPrime> wearing fo ra few days is NOT clrean

[2:51:45] <%mzrx7> LUL
[2:51:46] <+einheri> This story has had people fight over less important stuff than this
[2:51:47] <%gimmickypizza> stop
[2:51:48] <+DingusMcFadden> Rule of thumb Paige, all fighting game story lines are dumb
[2:51:49] <dekkitout> So are Just Talk and Crazy Talk the same Stand types?
[2:51:49] <+C24U> I thought Woolie's Stand was "My Chemical Romance"
[2:51:49] <%SaltyDongs> Why not just show you mean no harm by not fighting back and putting up your hands
[2:51:54] <sappinmahbinyot> @CptBritches Nothing is more stupid than "oh shit woops I accidentally fucking fried the everloving shit out of liu kang"
[2:51:55] <%spiritofmojave> Does Pat just rimshot his jammies
[2:51:55] <suikudo> stop
[2:51:56] <%Bladeexe> This timeline is super fucked
[2:51:56] <Tha_Mik> Pat
[2:51:56] <SuperCreeperBlocks> The MK storyline is actually more confusing than Kingdom Hearts
[2:51:57] <worldbrand> NotLikeThis
[2:51:57] <%MeowFyre> MeowFyre subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! apatElmo
[2:51:59] <dimensaur> to be fair, if my future self showed up and told me to stop being a jackass I totally would

[2:52:01] <a_mad_dragon> paigeballs
[2:52:01] <+CanonHusbando> it's funny because the MK cutscenes are well produced and probably the best in the genre but the story is trash and the writing sucks
[2:52:01] <%Remery_> This is the prettiest stage in a game :)
[2:52:04] <%SirGO0SE> cause im FREEEEE, FREEBALLIN
[2:52:05] <%Radregice_> thanks for clarifying

[2:53:15] <Onmi_Khaos> Man Raiden, why are you being so dark?
[2:53:16] <+Dull_Fangs> hey get ready for the thing you hate pat
[2:53:16] <D3rrtyD4n> it gets way way dumber soon
[2:53:17] <breakerdsx> Filler fight/BLEACH
[2:53:17] <%laserbeaming> this is a nice stage
[2:53:17] <alexandrecau> raiden fucks up as usual
[2:53:18] <$HentaiSenpai9K> 8h shit here we go again
[2:53:18] <NerdSquid> BUT ITS old characters fighting PAT!
[2:53:19] <CptBritches> I mean Raiden really has no reason to trust him though
[2:53:19] <zepelinnn> hes right now tho,
[2:53:19] <Jolly_Adventurer> Got to pad the game somehow. So more missunderstandings
[2:53:20] <%MightyMaxT> AngRaiden
[2:53:20] <+starzo0> Its fine guys, it gets dumber
[2:53:20] <+funny2allways> message deleted by a moderator.
[2:53:21] <%averyoddjew> pat, are you not using the environment on purpose?
[2:53:21] <eyezehuhh> Raiden continues to fuck up
[2:53:21] <+TheSaintJohn> Raiden is truly the worst earthrealm has to offer
[2:53:21] <Tha_Mik> DON'T YOU WANT TO FIGHT?
[2:53:22] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Scorpion deserves a medal for still trying.
[2:53:22] <%matrixManipulator> Scorpion Beats them all u then saves them?
[2:53:22] <%QueequegTheater> Scorpion needs two more fights in his chapter tho
[2:53:23] <benjiFG> does Raiden not do the scream anymore
[2:53:24] <Run44forrest> this is how conversations are done in mortal kombat
[2:53:24] <%HyraFukit> Make me understand with your FISTS ASURA
[2:53:25] <enfifirever> Raiden did it again
[2:53:25] <%ShaykhSpear> everyone getting shot, get shot!
[2:53:26] <pmtriox> remember how every fight in MK v DC started?
[2:53:26] <%deviljhojho94> MOoOOOORTAL KOMBAAAAAAAT
[2:53:27] <+Goat___Boy> filler fight
[2:53:27] <$SGrim> Pad it out Pad it out rooH
[2:53:28] <IntrepidEye> ok i guess i'll be even then. fuck you guys
[2:53:28] <InugamiTheHound> Raiden is so dumb. This fight would make sense if he fought him first instead of sub-zero
[2:53:29] <zepelinnn> Scorpion fucked up in the past
[2:53:30] <RollCritFail> Enough_Talk_Lets_Fight.mp4
[2:53:30] <Prism_Wing> Jesus Christ, Raiden. What happened to "No, I totally won't be an idiot this time"?
[2:53:30] <%PipIV> THERE'S NO TIME
[2:53:31] <asd2897> I mean everything is pointless
[2:53:33] <BreakersAweigh> careful guys, raiden might kill him
[2:53:33] <Onmi_Khaos> That's weird and paranoid and evil and doesn't make sense at all
[2:53:33] <+l0rd_anoos> Raisen doesn't deserve god powers he's a petty bitch
[2:53:34] <T_Sasquatch> WHY would anyone trust scorpion . chat use your brain
[2:53:35] <xshrike> Everyone in MK has aggression issues.
[2:53:35] <%castcode> Raiden is so good at this
[2:53:35] <$cureneckbeard> Is this Sekiro
[2:53:35] <%Mekhet09> I can't wait for the next story line.
[2:53:36] <chikensandwich> everyones being such a dick to scorpion
[2:53:37] <overlordkog> Local God Ruins Everything.png
[2:53:37] <CptBritches> Half the story has felt pointless
[2:53:37] <volraths_bane> No one trusts Scorpion for good reason, he always ducks everything up
[2:53:38] <JunkyardCrow> They really couldn't find a better way to give Scorp more fights?
[2:53:40] <%lazysaiyajin> wheres evil raiden?
[2:53:40] <NerdSquid> shut up though
[2:53:42] <%BeardedLuchador> Kappa why you gotta try to make the guy trying to get over his anger issues angry?
[2:53:43] <krelekari> jfc guys leave old scorpus be
[2:53:43] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> this better end with Raiden killing Old Scorpion
[2:53:44] <%Mekhet09> It's going to get so good.
[2:53:44] <ameraaaaaa> "why are we fighting"
[2:53:45] <joneworldbeater> Wise decisions as always, Raiden
[2:53:46] <dekkitout> @l0rd_anoos So a god?
[2:53:47] <Onmi_Khaos> Evil Raiden just disappeared
[2:53:48] <Weeabooninja> Does anything before MK9 matter?
[2:53:49] <Plague_bagel> this is worse then the story mode of that one inuyasha fighting game, the misunderstanding i mean
[2:53:49] <bearwagon> this just makes Raiden look more like an incompetent dumbasss
[2:53:50] <$vincerocmm> ponit in a bit
[2:53:50] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat Why pointless? Raiden is becoming evil again RIGHT NOW

[2:54:21] <+DingusMcFadden> Actually, that's basically J. Johna Jameson's back story
[2:54:21] <+Magnetoplasmadynamic> It undermines Scorpion's point a little when he knocks down Sub Zero or Raiden and goes. YOU WILL SUFFER in his evil voice. Not sure I would believe him either.
[2:54:22] <T_Sasquatch> you guys shut up, it pays off
[2:54:22] <%QueequegTheater> @yourliteraldog This is past Raiden, he found out that he became a huge cunt
[2:54:23] <%castcode> STILL MAD
[2:54:23] <$CarlosEoM> godammit raiden
[2:54:24] <$cureneckbeard> MK1 had the most logical plot. It was a fighting tournament. You're fighting because that's how fighting tournaments work

[2:55:30] <suikudo> There will be two evil Raidens
[2:55:30] <+A0N33> KRONIKA SHOULD WIN BY THIS POINT
[2:55:30] <Curly_Sparkle> so now we are playing as the bad guy?
[2:55:30] <RollCritFail> O'Lui Kang Must Suffer
[2:55:30] <NickHatesSnow> KRONIKA IS RIGHT
[2:55:31] <%mercado94> but muh amulet
[2:55:31] <+SuperiorDelta> Are for Fucking real with this shit

[2:55:32] <startstoprepeat> maybe there's a reason for that
[2:55:32] <rexdart> MUH EARTHREALM
[2:55:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> When everyone acts stupid all the time can you blame him?
[2:55:34] <PeakThuggery> KRONIKA WAS RIGHT
[2:55:34] <Vicemond> dang it Shinnok
[2:55:35] <ausl0> Dark Raiden again ResidentSleeper
[2:55:35] <%Birdigalore> Yo can I join Team Kronika?!
[2:55:35] <%iwishthiswasicq> Maybe we should just let Kronika win.
[2:55:35] <%Mekhet09> JUST WAIT FOR IT
[2:55:36] <%Tracazoid> Chronica did nothing wrong then?
[2:55:36] <%ThatGuyfromMars> aww man and raiden is supposed to win? this is bullshit
[2:55:36] <Zombrocom> We are seriously doing this AGAIN
[2:55:36] <%StEmlosWater> KRONIKA IS RIGHT
[2:55:37] <+Kaito_Cam> Maybe Kronika is right?
[2:55:37] <%spiritofmojave> Kronika had it righ
[2:55:37] <PerrinIsDead> Goddamnit Raiden
[2:55:37] <%RabbiKing> I suppose it's just his destiny
[2:55:38] <%ShaykhSpear> and that ione too!
[2:55:38] <+VektorTroika> This time it's CASSIE'S FAULT
[2:55:39] <Daiidalus> Blundergod lytLEERY
[2:55:39] <CptBritches> It feels like Ed Boon actively HATES Raiden
[2:55:39] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Raiden needs to fuck all the way off
[2:55:40] <Run44forrest> fuck it just let kromika kill him
[2:55:41] <+HarryWizard> I guess time lady is right??? Raiden is a shit bag????
[2:55:41] <%ItsRatman> KRONIKA WAS RIGHT
[2:55:42] <ExemplarKyle> Kronika is actually doing NOTHING wrong. Raiden fucks EVERYTHING up in EVERY timeline he's in
[2:55:42] <cherrycottontail> maybe raiden isnt actually a hero
[2:55:42] <bearwagon> Raiden gets me so tilted and i dont even play these games
[2:55:43] <joneworldbeater> "I vow no harm will come to you."
[2:55:44] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Gotta have my first hit props
[2:55:44] <$cureneckbeard> and it levitates.... MEEE
[2:55:45] <yourliteraldog> Oh shit it's the konami doggo!
[2:55:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Damn Raiden in that ass like Green grass
[2:55:46] <+DingusMcFadden> This game should have been call MK 11: Here We Go Again
[2:55:46] <Plague_bagel> maybe raidens just an asshole LUL
[2:55:47] <%Luvinsus> Now do you believe your other self Liu Kang?
[2:55:47] <coreybom> History really does repeat itself.
[2:55:47] <sappinmahbinyot> He's gonna fucking kill liu kang again isn't he?
[2:55:47] <Cortana0452> Kronika did nothing wrong
[2:55:48] <xshrike> Is Pat controlling Raiden here?
[2:55:48] <+BorinCorran> Netherrealm has such a massive hard on for making their Big Good crazy Knights Templar motherfuckers.
[2:55:48] <dimensaur> Raiden being an asshole is the Breath of the Wild of the Mortal Kombat timeline
[2:55:51] <IBeastmanNinjaI1> Is Raiden about to kill Lui Kang himself?
[2:55:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is like the god equivalent of john wick
[2:55:52] <zepelinnn> yo that was cool
[2:55:53] <$MajorCrasher> Fuck, maybe Kronika was right
[2:55:53] <%Tearonex> Holy FUCK raiden are YOU SERIOUS!?
[2:55:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Blundergod. Thats good LUL
[2:55:53] <%matrixManipulator> Ah fuck Pat's Raiden
[2:55:54] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Raiden and scorpion are literally not allowed to be on the same team
[2:55:55] <alexandrecau> Everyone act stupid because raiden acts stupider
[2:55:55] <silverira> we can't trust the white god of thunder
[2:55:55] <+starzo0> This is ed boons wild ride
[2:55:55] <T_Sasquatch> @exemplarkyle keep watching
[2:55:55] <LiquidMathew> In fairness Original Timeline was an asshole because everyone else kept fucking up, so then he created a timeline where he was the only one fucking up
[2:55:57] <%Remery_> I hate Raiden but he has some cool moves
[2:55:59] <Sloavon> @sappinmahbinyot :)
[2:55:59] <HaikuRaichu> You are giving Kronika more leverage you dumbass
[2:56:00] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Raiden needs to seriously die
[2:56:00] <indig0bird> In Raiden's defense, Scorpion is a n asshole 100% of the time
[2:56:01] <alcoholicstpmom> I feel like...kronikas right
[2:56:02] <%SirGO0SE> it sucks that i hate raiden so much but love playing him an equal amount
[2:56:03] <%AncelDeLambert> do the devs just hate Raiden?
[2:56:04] <StormKingLD> more timelines than that really
[2:56:04] <%Keeble24> Raiden you're beyond DUMB
[2:56:04] <arcaderabbit48> Raiden LITERALLY ALWAYS fucks shit up. It is a universal constant. A Fixed Point in Time.
[2:56:04] <CptBritches> Kronika is justified. She is just trying to right Raiden's wrongs
[2:56:07] <%AncelDeLambert> is that it?
[2:56:08] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This is why Raiden turned evil, he got tired of people blaming him all the time
[2:56:09] <+cvp5127> god raiden is just cyclops
[2:56:13] <Prism_Wing> Let Liu win, Pat! BibleThump
[2:56:13] <pillowwasp> Let kronika win. Fuck it
[2:56:14] <jastrouble97> is kronica the face now?
[2:56:15] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> I went to the bathroom for one second! What happened!?
[2:56:15] <D3rrtyD4n> please win so all will be revealed
[2:56:16] <DracaenaLeaf> Why is this Raiden's chapter
[2:56:16] <Ion_Laser> @DingusMcFadden and the sequel will be called MK12: Fuck It
[2:56:17] <%Radregice_> THE BABY
[2:56:19] <alexandrecau> @indig0bird so is Raiden and he gives himself a second chance
[2:56:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Is it me or is this game in 60k 420 vision

[2:56:25] <%Freelance7> Are we going to see Liu Kang die AGAIN
[2:56:25] <benjiFG> lewd
[2:56:25] <LiquidMathew> Kronika just a fanfic writer trying to make the best storyline

[3:15:24] <ScreamingMeat> Why didn't they send Scarlet here? She's be invincible.
[3:15:24] <digitialdemidevil> Frost probably doesn' thave a vagina now that she's a cyborg.
[3:15:24] <$CarlosEoM> dead
[3:15:25] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat it's not a fatality tho
[3:15:27] <fahquit> anyway no spoilers pls, but is this game worth buyin?
[3:15:27] <+linSP> just a flesh wound
[3:15:28] <ExemplarKyle> At least Frost can wash her vagina in the sink now. So, she's got that going for her.
[3:15:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Its like they need a new Bitch to replace Melinna, who at one point was a Queen Bitch
[3:15:29] <+Salvation122> Somehow not dead
[3:15:30] <gustavozxd> people gonna call her self insert sjw cause she has blue hair? holy shit man get out of your goblin cages LUL
[3:15:30] <+harpsichord_uiy> it never gets less brutal does it

[3:15:37] <+BoomerTiro> @Radregice_ ...I saw that
[3:15:38] <%chubbypencil> this is not a brutality
[3:15:39] <Onmi_Khaos> We can fuck Aigis, we can fuck Frost!
[3:15:40] <Plague_bagel> some of those are just fatalities LUL
[3:15:40] <+conradical> is paige asleep
[3:15:42] <Prism_Wing> That was awesome.
[3:15:42] <%chubbypencil> THIS IS A FATALITY
[3:15:43] <NeutrinoInteraction> I like that in order to ramp up the violence and gore it's just canon now that multiple headshots to the brain don't kill you in this universe
[3:15:43] <%Laecerelius> Makes some sense with him
[3:15:43] <Pookiedaexzile> So cold she half robot bitch
[3:15:44] <+Tokanova> i like my goblin cage

[3:15:47] <%QueequegTheater> trip her to death LUL
[3:15:47] <silverglove2012> frost is one of my favorite females and I just love how she is a cunt
[3:15:48] <$SGrim> @fahquit for story alone, no. If you like Mortal Kombat, yes.
[3:15:49] <Havren13> Nostalgia bomb of Austin Powers with those projectiles
[3:15:49] <coreybom> @fahquit Yes. Very much so.
[3:15:51] <@lewdskeletor13> @gustavozxd apatGoblin apatGoblin
[3:15:51] <InugamiTheHound> she's evil female version of jack frost from that kid's movie
[3:15:52] <%Reaped_Psyche> @ExemplarKyle IGotThatReference.jpeg
[3:15:54] <Onmi_Khaos> Just cause she's a robot means you aint trying hard enough
[3:15:56] <pillowwasp> Next MK will be banned in every country
[3:15:56] <abakkus> whether or not she got a cyborg vagina depends entirely on how horny kronika is
[3:15:58] <%spiritofmojave> @fahquit All I know so far is that the PC port is a mess, so I would say if you're interested probably PS4
[3:15:58] <%snow_bush> This is why he didn't pick you Frost, you're weak to shinkicks
[3:15:58] <majindusto> Mileena was best Queen Bitch BibleThump
[3:15:58] <+harpsichord_uiy> "yo you done"
[3:16:01] <+jorgamund> so are there just no Fatalities any more, just ultraviolence that doesn't kill people?

[3:17:55] <%dukenux> Land Hoe!
[3:17:56] <b1gboss007> Does this count as f?

[4:08:35] <+midgarmerc> Pat what's it like being a handsome devil?

[4:09:08] <%TDotGoat> he'll still shit the cube
[4:09:09] <Seitine> Aquariums suck lol.
[4:09:11] <%Megaleg> the point of whale watching is that you can see whales out of captivity, because whale captivity is super fuckd up
[4:09:12] <%MagickBurritoh> Pat adopts cube form to combat the time cube in the cube dimension
[4:09:14] <abakkus> uwu you are safe here inside the cube

[4:11:31] <fahquit> to stand up on and be a normal person
[4:11:32] <bleugh> why do they keep rebooting it...
[4:11:41] <%TheBigO75> Bayo is your mommy whether you like it or not
[4:11:41] <DracaenaLeaf> to replay they characters that died
[4:11:46] <alcors_wisdom> @Huntercd ok joker
[4:11:49] <+FilthyHereticHorus> @bleugh Money
[4:11:55] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Japanese people all got this thing where they're actually super weird and crazy and perverted but they gotta pretend like they're not so they don't get burned at the stake in public
[4:11:56] <majindusto> Never Stop Rebooting
[4:11:57] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Kiryu will get into Smash faster than he gets into Tekkeb
[4:12:05] <$Brother_Coduss> @bleugh because people keep buying it so they need an actual reason to keep making them
[4:12:05] <%nitronLVIII> it really feels like this could be the last mortal kombat tho
[4:12:11] <%Kataguro> I agree
[4:12:12] <LiquidMathew> so the point of this game is to go "ok there's gonna be another another universe"
[4:12:13] <starotter70> Every time
[4:12:13] <%SaltyDongs> grossest eyeball
[4:12:14] <prime_name> Agreed
[4:12:15] <Prism_Wing> Joke's on you. I'll never get fucked.

[4:12:30] <+tasenhall> I need a review of the couchmaster

[4:12:46] <%spiritofmojave> I want to help, I HATE HELPING!

[4:12:53] <%TheMilhouseExperience> He must win
[4:12:57] <LiquidMathew> also everyone always sparring
[4:13:00] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@nitronLVIII) (warning)
[4:13:00] <%GohanEgret> but that's like trusting Kevin Owens, what do you expect?
[4:13:02] <@Pandora_Prime> Murder them until they listen.
[4:13:03] <kingbaconcrispy> With the timeline reset why don't they just go back to tournaments. Aren't the tournaments a normal part of that universe?
