[0:40:08] <%CelioHogane> @ringabal no, there isn't
[0:40:09] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> There is America and not America, that is the only locations of any relevance
[0:40:09] <%televisedrevolting> California is somewhere west of me.
[0:40:11] <+Remery_> Because Americans only care about AMERICA
[0:40:11] <%marsantas> San Diego is like Mexico's Detroit
[0:40:12] <%cvp5127> yes
[0:40:12] <%Quigsies> “WE?”

[0:40:15] <%boogaleeboo> Yes, this is "our" problem
[0:40:16] <%Niney_Who> I live in San Diego
[0:40:16] <%Maids4lyfe> GEOGRAPHY? I DON'T NEED TO LEARN ABOUT SQUARES AND OCTAGONS
[0:40:16] <%starotter70> Cause they don't teach it in school
[0:40:17] <%ShichiNoBushi> Because we are the center of the world, and nowhere else matters.
[0:40:18] <%patriotrenegade> @patstaresat I sent Paige a video on Twitter about the donkeys
[0:40:18] <%Niney_Who> It's not that bad
[0:40:18] <%abakkus> i forget half the states exist. i just remembered montana is real and its got me fucked up
[0:40:18] <%conradical> is this joke worth food?

[0:40:22] <%luftraumm1> imperialism and bad primary education
[0:40:23] <%Frost_Quill> I am legit pretty bad at real life geography. I'm much more interested in fantast world maps and countries to be honest.

[0:40:24] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I loved geography.
[0:40:26] <%Alseid> I mean you took the name of a bigass continent and just said THAT'S US NOW
[0:40:26] <%therealgirthman> Paige will let Pat starve if he can't name the capital city of every American state
[0:40:27] <%Bonkasaurusrex> You wanna run that one back real quick
[0:40:27] <%TheMattman1313> Also cuz we have 50 fucking states instead of like 20 provinces
[0:40:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> The American education system is a disgrace
[0:40:28] <%SaiyanShoto> Didn’t Pat not know where to buy a hammer?
[0:40:30] <%conradical> alaska is down by hawaii
[0:40:31] <%fallen92x> you could literally walk down the street and go from being in America to being in Mexico.
[0:40:32] <%starotter70> What about hawaii
[0:40:33] <%linSP> it’s just women who are bad at geography

[0:44:24] <%코코꾸라> Check the difficulty
[0:44:24] <%Aydarkzero> yerp
[0:44:25] <%RetroCop87> oh
[0:44:26] <%delilah4you> Are ya winnin son?
[0:44:26] <%Dragon_Batman> Honestly it isn't that bad
[0:44:28] <%cowardman93> [suspicion]
[0:44:28] <%logoth_> ONLY two hours
[0:44:31] <%spiritofmojave> Easymode easy?
[0:44:31] <%CelioHogane> @PlagueOfGripes now YOU are pretty insane!
[0:44:35] <%Aydarkzero> i left here at 45
[0:44:35] <%worldbrand> Did you grind the 2 hours or did you drill into the Time tree for hour beans?
[0:44:35] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Make sure your difficulty mode is set properly.
[0:44:36] <%conradical> it's way easier to level postgame
[0:44:37] <%boogaleeboo> 50 is super overkill for normal
[0:44:38] <%sporeian94> >Grinding
[0:44:40] <%Zutrax> He can get to 50 in like less than an hour post game.
[0:44:43] <%patriotrenegade> The final bit isn’t too hard, this should be a cake walk
[0:44:43] <%Zutrax> Don't waste your time
[0:44:46] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Sanity check for difficulty
[0:44:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> ELI IS SHORT FOR HELENA IN SCANDANAVIA
[0:44:48] <%SaiyanShoto> I was like at level 40 at this part I think
[0:44:48] <%Charonofthememe> @ultimatetotoro Thanks a bunch!
[0:44:48] <%Dragon_Batman> LUL that is right
[0:44:48] <%Scarnehu> specs on your weapons?
[0:44:54] <%linSP> Ground hours
[0:44:55] <%siamzero94> @PlagueOfGripes 50 because of Bahamut?
[0:44:56] <%Frost_Quill> The sound of Tifa and Barret's footsteps were so real I thought someone was breaking into my house.
[0:45:00] <$Solid_Stro> And Eli was talking about how much he loved the game
[0:45:01] <+PlagueOfGripes> you get EXP materia way, WAY too late in the game for it to matter
[0:45:03] <%amiroodude> saved
[0:45:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> @worldbrand Is that the IRL pay to win mechanic?
[0:45:12] <%Nupinoop296> that's good
[0:45:13] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Even defaults to no, nice
[0:45:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Barret, quit being a dingaling
[0:45:15] <%snugglepuggs> When u grinded did u set it to Auto Pat?
[0:45:16] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea, the no return wall
[0:45:18] <%Aydarkzero> @PlagueOfGripes Square tends to that a lot
[0:45:19] <%Verd_254> it's much appreciated.
[0:45:20] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> It's nice
[0:45:25] <%Axellogic> Pat has now missed all the things
[0:45:27] <%Aracon_> the point of no return
[0:45:30] <%valriot> EXP materia is to get to 50 for Hard mode
[0:45:33] <%aishman> @PeachSaliva Hope you don't mind but I sent you a DM on twitter about some colombian foods you might like!
[0:45:33] <%patriotrenegade> @patstaresat Paige, I sent you a great video on Twitter
[0:45:34] <%SH1NK1R0> Yeah the xp materia felt like a joke.
[0:45:35] <%prism_zet> did you get the secret weapons from the chests in the lab?
[0:45:35] <%suikudo> Thats right orb boy go rescue my bae
[0:45:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> Hey just so you know, player, this is the part of the game where you start getting railroaded.
[0:45:50] <%tigerfang86> STILL TRUE
[0:45:51] <%ringabal> HE IS THOUGH
[0:45:51] <%spiritofmojave> He is

[0:46:10] <%spiritofmojave> Barret's the best character by the end of this
[0:46:10] <%DexteraXIII> Now Barrett has the script.
[0:46:10] <%NitronStreams> BIG SWORD
[0:46:11] <%BoomerUnchained> NO, EX-SOLDIER

[0:46:17] <%prism_zet> @aeoneth jk lol trying to rile Pat up
[0:46:20] <%TheMattman1313> FUCKING CLOUD
[0:46:22] <%weissguard> I GOT SKILLS. BabyRage
[0:46:24] <%CelioHogane> "NO SHUT UP IM TOTALLY AN ASSHOLE!"
[0:46:26] <%patriotrenegade> NO IM COOL SHUT UP
[0:46:28] <%cowardman93> man I love the characterisation everyone has now
[0:46:28] <%Solid_Stro> MGS talk about the battlefield
[0:46:28] <@mothmandraws> I cant wait for vincent and cloud to out emo each other
[0:46:31] <%siamzero94> Fuck, the edge is too much
[0:46:33] <%sporeian94> What scene did Pat get in the flowerbed?
[0:46:33] <%logoth_> I didnt get that scene
[0:46:33] <%tigerfang86> GRAPPLE AWAY
[0:46:34] <%Aeoneth> oh good I thought I was missing something
[0:46:34] <%Frost_Quill> I love they made Cloud a fucking huge dork. It's GREAT.
[0:46:36] <%spiritofmojave> I-IVE GOT SKILLS
[0:46:39] <%prism_zet> hahahah
[0:46:39] <%boogaleeboo> Cloud's greatest weakness: Emotional sincerity
[0:46:39] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yo who wants to hop on the Aerith x Tifa train with me
[0:46:39] <%therealgirthman> GOD Vincent is gonna be OMEGA edge
[0:46:41] <%LokimenD> [GRAPPLE AWAY]
[0:46:51] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Everything Barret just said about Cloud is 110% accurate
[0:46:51] <%Ynkubus18> Hes a goth, oh my god
[0:46:53] <%DeoxysPrime> I love this chapter
[0:46:53] <%Frost_Quill> I want Cloud to have a moment where he goes "Is that what I come off like???"
[0:46:53] <@mothmandraws> Boomer emo
[0:46:53] <+PlagueOfGripes> god. japan is so eaten up with Vincent, there's no way he'll be the same
[0:46:54] <%ConLin_Arts_> this part is cool
[0:46:54] <%valriot> I want Vincent to just drop the F bomb l
[0:46:56] <%ringabal> Did YOU get cucked, Cloud?
[0:46:56] <%Laecerelius> Cloud is gonna be all "OMG He's so COOOOOOL!!"
[0:46:56] <%Dragon_Batman> Cloud will look at Vincent and be like, was I that bad?
[0:46:56] <%XenomorphicTendencies> Women are going to be latching onto Vincent's arms while Cloud stews cuz hes not as cool
[0:46:57] <%CelioHogane> @mothmandraws nah man, Cloud's gotta be way past that shit, there is no way he stays that emo for like 3 games.
[0:46:59] <%saynof> It's nothing personal, kids
[0:46:59] <%cowardman93> I want Vincent to be near psychopathic with his Hojo murder-boner
[0:47:02] <%LokimenD> I thought Pat had finished the game already?
[0:47:03] <%j0ustar> The more Cloud talks, the more dumb he sounds if you played Crisis Core LUL
[0:47:03] <%linSP> EMO WAR
[0:47:04] <%patriotrenegade> lol that chapter title
[0:47:06] <%Solid_Stro> Vincent is just gonna quote lines from the goth kids in South Park
[0:47:06] <%tigerfang86> SHUT UP THO PAT
[0:47:06] <%toastybites> Vincent flies away with fire and Cloud just cries
[0:47:08] <%NitronStreams> Vincent is just gonna be Batman
[0:47:09] <%aBlueWizard> I'm glad the game is self aware enough about how Cloud comes off.
[0:47:09] <%ShichiNoBushi> Vincent: "Cloud, I turn into monsters for my Limit Break."
[0:47:11] <%Verd_254> get ready for jpg
[0:47:14] <%Chichen> Copy
[0:47:15] <%worldbrand> Three because two are the same
[0:47:15] <%iosephe> It's only 3
[0:47:15] <%patriotrenegade> doodRage doodRage doodRage
[0:47:17] <%Frost_Quill> They were two-parter goals.
[0:47:19] <%Laecerelius> It's like twenty goals
[0:47:19] <%InfamousShephard> i love you barret
[0:47:19] <%conradical> barret can't count, he has eco terror to do
[0:47:23] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> 5th Goal, learn to count.
[0:47:24] <%valkuma> Cloud to Vincent: "I am the monsters"
[0:47:28] <@mothmandraws> vincent constantly looking for a phone in AC better show up lol
[0:47:28] <%siamzero94> psaJpeg PREPARE
[0:47:28] <%aBlueWizard> which makes him instantly more likable then someone like Squall.
[0:47:28] <%KasiCrafter> You can have sub goals!
[0:47:34] <%Aracon_> it makes no sense
[0:47:34] <%tigerfang86> H O W
[0:47:35] <%lionmanguy> Is something screwing up on twitch for me, or does the music sound detuned for some reason?
[0:47:35] <%spiritofmojave> how
[0:47:36] <%valriot> ?
[0:47:40] <%CelioHogane> @ShichiNoBushi i hope that isn't his limit break anymore, i want to play as monster.
[0:47:41] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> WAT
[0:47:41] <%sporeian94> Vincent's coffin gonna have that club music from Vampire Masquerade
[0:47:41] <%Sir_stride> its possible
[0:47:42] <%SGrim> psaJpeg
[0:47:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> haha orphans
[0:47:44] <%patriotrenegade> yeah that’s fucking nuts
[0:47:45] <%SvenHolgersson> ZERO STAKES
[0:47:45] <%Zutrax> What people ABOVE survived?
[0:47:48] <%Mr_Pylon> 300 meters I think
[0:47:49] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Oh god dont look at the background Pat...
[0:47:50] <%toastybites> daddy's a pancake
[0:47:51] <%Dragon_Batman> Alot of people still died but some managed
[0:47:51] <%worldbrand> They ALL had grappling hooks
[0:47:51] <%tigerfang86> it's POSSIBLE but ITS SUPER IMPROBABLE
[0:47:51] <%DukeBlack_> luck
[0:47:52] <%NeonNobleKalzeria> 300 meters, but everyone's a-okay
[0:47:55] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt It's the equivalent of Cloud falling into the church
[0:47:56] <%za7az> massive luck?
[0:47:56] <%prism_zet> 300 metres is right
[0:47:58] <%rolfalex> Jessie's parents?
[0:47:59] <%Aydarkzero> shut up though
[0:47:59] <%spiritofmojave> the impact of the shock would super mess them up at least
[0:48:00] <%CelioHogane> CORPOSES CUISHONED PEOPLE
[0:48:01] <%KasiCrafter> I mean. People survive disasters all the time.
[0:48:03] <%tweedler92> Jessie's dad is super dead
[0:48:04] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> i mean there are people who survived other tragedy
[0:48:04] <%starotter70> Nat 20's
[0:48:06] <%logoth_> dont worry about it!
[0:48:09] <%Aracon_> everyone has super armor
[0:48:09] <%Chichen> dark souls fall damage
[0:48:10] <%patriotrenegade> Shinra engineering
[0:48:10] <%boogaleeboo> It's all the Mako in the air
[0:48:11] <%NeonNobleKalzeria> I thought Cloud was saved by ghosts
[0:48:11] <%prism_zet> Jessie's parents moved to sector 8
[0:48:12] <%MAX116030> you make it sound like everybody survived
[0:48:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> THEY DOUBLE JUMPED BEFORE IMPACT
[0:48:12] <%pureotome> it's super crazy
[0:48:13] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt People from the top got stuck in the slums after the trains got cancelled
[0:48:14] <%worldbrand> cloud's a super mutant
[0:48:15] <%Solid_Stro> What’s fucked up is that Jessie’s parents are probably dead too
[0:48:15] <%MildConviction> @PatStaresAt some people were in bed when it happened so their fall was cushioned
[0:48:15] <%Mr_Pylon> They all jumped RIGHT before they hit the gorund
[0:48:16] <%cvp5127> they dropped a city on top of another city
[0:48:18] <@mothmandraws> depends what the % of survivors were
[0:48:19] <%ScreamLord> I can see a few surviving
[0:48:19] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> they all jumped before they hit the ground
[0:48:19] <%siamzero94> But Cloud is fucked up from all the experiments
[0:48:20] <%boogaleeboo> Just jumped up on Mako juice
[0:48:20] <+PlagueOfGripes> every last part of the plate drop is ridiculous. from it being supported by one pillar at all, to the way it falls, to how many survive, to why they thought it was a good idea, etc
[0:48:21] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> what the fuck is kilometer in Metric?
[0:48:22] <%Frost_Quill> Cloud is a super soldier mutant experiment though.
[0:48:23] <%valkuma> youve seen how many times you slash Becks badasses with an 800 pound sword and they only get "knocked out"
[0:48:24] <%ShinyBisharp1> This part of the game dont look so good
[0:48:25] <%conradical> they just all jumped before they hit the ground
[0:48:25] <%tigerfang86> GOT EM
[0:48:27] <%schlager087> the people of midgar are literal ants
[0:48:28] <%Dragon_Batman> Who knows how many are from the top anyway
[0:48:28] <%therealgirthman> CALLED OUT
[0:48:29] <%worldbrand> U U U U
[0:48:29] <%Aydarkzero> GOT EM
[0:48:30] <%sporeian94> GOTTEM
[0:48:31] <%logoth_> You might want to load your textures on time
[0:48:32] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Dude, I have a sword bigger than you!
[0:48:34] <%hardcore_violence> sword broke Clouds fall!
[0:48:35] <%XenomorphicTendencies> Everyone has RE3R Jill durability
[0:48:36] <%cowardman93> Gravity is a random number generator in FF7 universe
[0:48:37] <%collind99> bro that guy is super short
[0:48:39] <%ringabal> GET AN AMBULANCE...BUT NOT FOR ME
[0:48:40] <%patriotrenegade> You might want to load your textures faster dude
[0:48:43] <%spiritofmojave> GOT THAT VICTIM
[0:48:43] <%CelioHogane> @tweedler92 his soul is now powering someone's TV.
[0:48:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Cloud a legit sociopath
[0:48:44] <%prism_zet> a kilometer in metric is 1000 metres
[0:48:46] <%schlager087> more powerful than an ant several times it's normal size
[0:48:50] <@mothmandraws> ff14 rules, they did not have aggro so just went to 1hp
[0:48:52] <%j0ustar> truth
[0:48:53] <+PlagueOfGripes> Aeris has the script
[0:48:58] <%worldbrand> tifa is outstanding in certain categories
[0:49:00] <%PocketChange117> @PlagueOfGripes glad im not the only one thinking that about the plate drop
[0:49:02] <+PlagueOfGripes> Cetra script powers
[0:49:04] <%Axellogic> Pat you will now be drowning in gil
[0:49:05] <%KawaiiJetty> Tifa is just tired
[0:49:05] <%Nupinoop296> the save icon...
[0:49:10] <%Laecerelius> Aerith made a deal with David Cage
[0:49:11] <%Frost_Quill> Gravity has to roll for every single person's damage.
[0:49:15] <%ringabal> The Holy Materia is just a USB of the SCRIPT
[0:49:16] <%logoth_> Aeris is that the script in your hands
[0:49:16] <%tigerfang86> BABABABA
[0:49:16] <%sporeian94> Pat you gonna play the game on hard mode? It's hard af

[0:49:50] <%prism_zet> he needs thunder you goif
[0:49:52] <%mighty_max_t> Thats smart
[0:49:53] <%tigerfang86> makes sense
[0:49:55] <%aBlueWizard> I really enjoyed this chapter. I'm super excited i got to catch Pat doing it live.
[0:49:55] <%Aydarkzero> Wind Bullets
[0:49:57] <%valriot> Pat being smart, wtf is this
[0:50:02] <%Frost_Quill> KNUCKLES
[0:50:08] <%Aracon_> psaBig punch damage
[0:50:10] <%patriotrenegade> I never noticed Barrett’s gun actually ejected shells

[0:50:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> How did anyone in this world agree to Mako energy when the lifestream is literally their afterlife?
[0:50:18] <%SummonerMagno> does Tifa chuckle??
[0:50:19] <%logoth_> Look at this jpeg
[0:50:20] <%tigerfang86> Shut UP THO
[0:50:20] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Unlike Cloud she will chuckle
[0:50:21] <%Dragon_Batman> Those are the top ones
[0:50:23] <%CelioHogane> GOOD ARCHITECTS!
[0:50:23] <%worldbrand> They had grappling hooks too
[0:50:23] <%furiousfurioso> I think thats a different sector
[0:50:24] <+PlagueOfGripes> Shinra cares
[0:50:24] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Stupid anime rules.
[0:50:25] <%ahdurian> ITS MAKO SHUT UP THO
[0:50:25] <%DeoxysPrime> That was the other sector
[0:50:25] <%patriotrenegade> Oh don’t look at that background texture
[0:50:27] <%boogaleeboo> Reeve is a shitty human being that is good at his job
[0:50:29] <%LokimenD> The magic of Video Games
[0:50:29] <%conradical> they all jumped thereby negating fall damage
[0:50:29] <%ScottishMadJacko> future materials
[0:50:30] <%ringabal> What kind of bird is this?
[0:50:30] <%PocketChange117> the poor people cushioned the plate drop
[0:50:30] <%valriot> The poor people cushioned the fall
[0:50:33] <%siamzero94> @PatStaresAt TAKE A LONG GOOD LOOK AT THE "SKYBOX"
[0:50:34] <%mechslayer71> This music SourPls
[0:50:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @PlagueOfGripes Its actually a really realistic way for it to fall apart. When a vertical load bearing support breaks on a ceiling, the frist thing breaking is distanc far horizontal supports and trusses. Itll literall break parts that are far and distant away
[0:50:35] <%NitronStreams> They were up to code
[0:50:35] <%spiritofmojave> Shinra doesn't have engineering factories LUL
[0:50:40] <%sporeian94> Look at that Janky ass JPEG Background
[0:50:41] <%Laecerelius> It's a monster gird you're gonna have to fight later!
[0:50:42] <%worldbrand> @PatStaresAt all of the topsiders and some of the buildings had grappling hooks
[0:50:43] <%patriotrenegade> SMASH BOXES

[0:50:46] <%patriotrenegade> BOXES
[0:50:50] <%valkuma> @boogaleeboo reeve isnt a shitty human at all hes trying desparately to save people the whole game
[0:50:51] <%Meow0369> Good morning
[0:50:51] <%goose_attack_almanac> Construction on top of the plate doesn't fuck around
[0:51:01] <%weissguard> Didn't the Plate break apart in order to fall? Not just falling in one piece? Idk man, shit's weird.

[0:51:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> Calm thy mammeries
[0:51:16] <%SH1NK1R0> @generalscpatton most people I the ff7 world don’t even know why a life stream is and they aren’t told that mako comes from it either
[0:51:18] <%j0ustar> Ok now I can "kind of" see how the area near the slums survived although it's still ridiculous
[0:51:19] <%boogaleeboo> We can have that conversation later!
[0:51:19] <%patriotrenegade> YEAH
[0:51:21] <%Frost_Quill> There are literally ghosts that can turn invisible, I'd be paranoid too.
[0:51:23] <%Animorphimagi> can't wait to see the end of this shitshow
[0:51:29] <%baronblank> same
[0:51:32] <%Aydarkzero> what?
[0:51:34] <%Meow0369> Hurray I made it in time to witness the jpeg
[0:51:34] <%sniffy77> Hey Pat, since aerith, barret, and tifa got a lot of play in this part, do you think that they might take a bit of a step back to allow Yuffie, Cid, Vincent, ect to take focus in the next?
[0:51:41] <%ShichiNoBushi> Why are these third-tier potions called "Mega Potions" and not "X Potions"?
[0:51:50] <+PlagueOfGripes> Remember, we're climbing the plate instead of walking down the train tracks again to stay secret! Shhhhhh
[0:51:52] <%CelioHogane> @sniffy77 i doubt it.
[0:51:53] <%spiritofmojave> heck ye
[0:51:54] <%pynkdoe> i hope that one shitty jump sequence from the og game is here too
[0:51:55] <%Chichen> me
[0:51:56] <%Frost_Quill> I'm playing it right now.
[0:51:57] <%starotter70> Ye
[0:51:59] <%Laecerelius> Is this how you've determined to live your life, monster?!
[0:51:59] <%MildConviction> yes
[0:51:59] <%valriot> Fuck that dungeon
[0:52:00] <%prism_zet> @shichinobushi that bugged me too

[0:52:00] <%Kitafin> sup
[0:52:00] <%SomeSageAdvice> ye im in here
[0:52:01] <%DexteraXIII> I just started last week.
[0:52:02] <%Chichen> Yep yep
[0:52:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @weissguard Nope its actually really realsitic, it wouldn't come down as one piece. If the the support would break, it wouldnt ALL break at once
[0:52:05] <%walternatorz> totes
[0:52:05] <%RedKnightVI> Oh god that dungeon
[0:52:05] <%Nupinoop296> oh i get you
[0:52:06] <@mothmandraws> oh ye
[0:52:06] <%ScottishMadJacko> The skill from those is pretty good
[0:52:06] <%Frost_Quill> Yeah.

[0:52:08] <%spiritofmojave> the wreckage kinda is
[0:52:09] <%MildConviction> true
[0:52:09] <%chaplianarthos> ye
[0:52:09] <%NeonNobleKalzeria> Ooooh, I'm picking up what you're putting down, yeah
[0:52:11] <%SomeSageAdvice> Yup, same feel i agree
[0:52:13] <%ALazo> Now that you mention it
[0:52:17] <%Aydarkzero> i'll have to take your word for it Pat
[0:52:20] <%genowyn> I see it
[0:52:20] <%Frost_Quill> Especially with the drakes.
[0:52:21] <%SaphronBlackbourne> What the fuck was that series of words
[0:52:21] <%Verd_254> i can see that
[0:52:21] <%cowardman93> man I did that like 2 weeks ago and yeah it is similar feeling
[0:52:22] <@mothmandraws> get ready to hit those barrels out the way
[0:52:23] <%NeonNobleKalzeria> I knew there was something familiar about this part
[0:52:24] <%SomeSageAdvice> even the music almost feels the same
[0:52:25] <%corgispudmen> well you are in midgard
[0:52:26] <%hycind53> Push those tanks
[0:52:28] <%CelioHogane> @sniffy77 hell, i don't think Cid is going to be at all in the next part, and Vincent MAYBE.
[0:52:29] <%valriot> Cant wait for Barrett to pull 1 add and not use cooldowns
[0:52:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sh1nk1r0 Still, does the Shinra CEO have his own private artificial lifestream that will prevent his soul from fueling a car?
[0:52:36] <%mechslayer71> What’s the name of this song geez
[0:52:43] <%Aracon_> barret is a man of god
[0:52:45] <%NitronStreams> this color palette make this area look like Nier Automata a little
[0:52:47] <@mothmandraws> see middys corpse impaled by that ship "did sephiroth do this"
[0:52:48] <%ALazo> preacher man barret prays
[0:52:53] <%MildConviction> i hope we get a little baby scorpion sentinel at the end of this
[0:52:55] <%Frost_Quill> @valriot Barret is clearly DPS, and so is Tifa. Cloud is the DRK.
[0:52:56] <%GarbageQueenEllie> thots and prayers
[0:52:57] <%starotter70> BlessRNG
[0:52:57] <%Aydarkzero> psaBig Prayers
[0:52:58] <%genowyn> MCH, MNK, DRK party, no healer
[0:53:01] <%SvenHolgersson> Can we get some poggers in this chat plz
[0:53:01] <%Solid_Stro> Fast travel in part 2 is that you just step into Vincent’s cloak and he wooshes away
[0:53:08] <%KawaiiJetty> BlessRNG
[0:53:13] <%Dragon_Batman> The factory or amusement park mostly yea @NitronStreams
[0:53:13] <%pureotome> Barrett fills his ATB gauge pretty quick
[0:53:13] <%Odyr2001> Does anyone else think that the music is a bit too loud compared to pat or am i the 1 guy?
[0:53:14] <%tigerfang86> usedSweat
[0:53:16] <%spiritofmojave> GIB SHOWER
[0:53:18] <%Aracon_> tifa you STILL haven't taken that shower
[0:53:18] <%goose_attack_almanac> Midgar being a massive super-structure in general is already beyond the scope of reality. I imagine everything here is some fancy lightweight metal Shinra made. OR ITS ALL MAGIC
[0:53:21] <@SoFarFetched> Maybe she just wants a blood shower.
[0:53:23] <%CelioHogane> @Solid_Stro only if we see Vincent in part 2...
[0:53:24] <+PlagueOfGripes> Aeris isn't too great at praying, coincidentally
[0:53:27] <%PR0swagonist> no you dont get it. she'll KILL

[0:53:39] <%Odyr2001> no echo
[0:53:41] <@commanderclaw> People think showering with your SO is hot, but it really doesn't work logistically
[0:53:41] <%ryome> Giv shower
[0:53:41] <%CelioHogane> Maybe.. nah.
[0:53:43] <%lionmanguy> The music sounds detuned to me but I think that's my internet
[0:53:43] <%chaplianarthos> no
[0:53:44] <%Meow0369> Pat look at the jpeg
[0:53:46] <%rolfalex> no
[0:53:49] <%SH1NK1R0> @generalscpatton he believes that once they find the promised land he can conceivably become immortal and have access to infinite mako. So he really doesn’t care that literal souls power his company.
[0:53:49] <%sporeian94> 35!?!?! Pat you are at the same level most people are at during the end of the GAME!?!?!
[0:53:50] <%za7az> Music seems to be a touch loud though

[0:53:51] <%tigerfang86> barrett pls

[0:53:55] <%spiritofmojave> nice sfx Barret LUL
[0:53:57] <%weissguard> @XeroSigmaPrime I wasn't questioning the realistic aspect of the plate falling. At the time of my typing, Pat questioned how any of the buildings were standing. I put that idea forth to suppose that the whole thing coming down in one piece would have flattened the area. Instead, we now have buildings that are intact. But it's cool that it's somewhat (?) realistic.
[0:53:58] <%pynkdoe> jermaChomp aaaa
[0:53:59] <%LokimenD> LUL
[0:54:02] <%ScottishMadJacko> I fucking love Barret

[0:54:23] <%NeonNobleKalzeria> Oh wow I didn't even pick up on that
[0:54:28] <%SvenHolgersson> Like for real it should be in the thousands
[0:54:29] <%Laecerelius> Are we sure it isn't a barnacle?
[0:54:31] <%NitronStreams> DONT FUCK UP
[0:54:37] <%sporeian94> Could Tifa know someone out with her breasts? Like if she swung them at someone's head super hard could she knock them out?!

[0:54:52] <@commanderclaw> @goose_attack_almanac Also cause hot in the front of the shower means cold in the back, while hot enough in the back is too hot in the front
[0:54:52] <%valkuma> i wish i knew what he meant about "The way you do this grapple will tell us alot about you"
[0:54:52] <%Laecerelius> Japan has learned of the power of the grappling hook
[0:54:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> YA YOU KNOW WE ARE OUT THERE

[0:55:14] <%sporeian94> Johnny = Ryuji
[0:55:16] <%pureotome> I don't know why but I thought this was gonna be grappling mini game the way it was stated
[0:55:16] <%Aydarkzero> @spiritofmojave i thought so too, like oh no Tifa's watching monkaS
[0:55:16] <%starotter70> Barret needs Murder
[0:55:17] <%televisedrevolting> Wake up, get up, get out there...

[0:55:25] <ringabal> YEAH THIS DUMB THING
[0:55:29] <%aBlueWizard> @pat if you look at the map it tells you how many meters up you are through this chapter.
[0:55:29] <%Frost_Quill> Barret is Ryuji, right? Tifa is Makoto. Jessie is Ann, and Aerith is Haru.
[0:55:31] <%valriot> Its the Machinist LB3
[0:55:33] <%cowardman93> look it's that dumb bullshit

[0:55:39] <%KasiCrafter> Just HAD to say something, Barret...
[0:55:39] <%Frost_Quill> Red is Morgana, Vincent is Yusuke I guess?
[0:55:41] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> HELI GUNNER
[0:55:42] <%SH1NK1R0> It’s systems like this and the solo barret part that feel like future proofing for later mechanics more than anything
[0:55:45] <%CelioHogane> ONE SECOND DO CRIMES
[0:55:48] <%tigerfang86> what if we just... didn't get ourselves killed
[0:55:49] <%42nfl19> THIS IS A SNEAKING MISSION

[0:56:03] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @weissguard Oh yea the way it fell in the FMV was actually super cool and made sense. But you're also right that it settled really weird... The Aftermath looks funky
[0:56:06] <%starotter70> Would that make Yuffie Futaba?
[0:56:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Who is futaba?
[0:56:10] <%XenomorphicTendencies> whats the practicality of hand propellers over like a backpack thing
[0:56:10] <%sporeian94> DA MAKO

[0:57:57] <%Frost_Quill> Shinra obviously told it's employees and guards that Avalanche did this. So their anger is justified but misdirected.

[1:01:15] <%rontopronto> Barrett is a Big Ol' HIMBO
[1:01:16] <%sporeian94> USE THE K WORD PAT!
[1:01:16] <%patriotrenegade> Government name
[1:01:18] <%Meow0369> Big jpeg
[1:01:18] <%tigerfang86> YEYEYEYEY
[1:01:22] <%aBlueWizard> Oh no, do we have to have slave names now so he doesn't know who we really are?
[1:01:22] <%Mr_Pylon> It's their Truename
[1:01:23] <%TheMattman1313> It's cuz Pat doesn't constantly ask for your sub
[1:01:25] <%Laecerelius> True Name!
[1:01:25] <%CelioHogane> SCAN
[1:01:27] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> LMAO
[1:01:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Government name is your TRUENAME.
[1:01:34] <%SpcOpsBear> Pat confirmed for Truenamer
[1:01:37] <Balsty> Balsty subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:01:38] <%PanicSwytch> Is this Deathnote
[1:01:41] <%Masamune195> the clap of barrett's ass keeps alerting everyone that they're avalanche
[1:01:42] <%spiritofmojave> Don't make him use your engineering name
[1:01:46] <%ShichiNoBushi> It’s like a True Name.
[1:01:47] <%Jekado> Pat has the geass powers?
[1:01:48] <%PocketChange117> What if Pat didn't let us see the cutscenes unless we met a sub goal LOL
[1:01:51] <%PR0swagonist> I can't believe he knows your servant class and name
[1:01:54] <%televisedrevolting> Once Pat speaks his True Name, all his stats decrease by 25%.
[1:01:54] <+PlagueOfGripes> Hack through waves of Roches
[1:01:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> Never get caught being horny on True Name
[1:01:58] <%NitronStreams> you know these 3C Soldiers are pretty cool
[1:02:04] <%CelioHogane> Streamers are like witches, if they know your real name, they can steal your soul
[1:02:07] <%Frost_Quill> Just like the Demonica Infernal explained, if you know a demon's government name you can bind them.
[1:02:07] <%patriotrenegade> Wasn’t Roche a SOLDIER 3rd Class
[1:02:15] <%CelioHogane> @patriotrenegade probably stronger, tho
[1:02:16] <%aBlueWizard> they steal your money.
[1:02:20] <%Balsty> I subbed just so I could say FUCK the music in this zone SLAPS
[1:02:21] <%patriotrenegade> Why are these guys so weak compared to Roche
[1:02:26] <%boogaleeboo> music
[1:02:27] <%KawaiiJetty> Why these SOLDIERs are not using q crazy motorcycle
[1:02:34] <%Robot_Nixon_> The bike gives him powers
[1:02:36] <%CelioHogane> no
[1:02:38] <%siamzero94> nope 3rd
[1:02:39] <%NitronStreams> 3rd
[1:02:40] <%rufus2k2> no he's 3rd class
[1:02:40] <%CelioHogane> 3rd class too
[1:02:40] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea Roche is third class, he just seems the best out of the litter
[1:02:41] <%starotter70> Nope
[1:02:41] <%boki_86> no 3rd
[1:02:41] <%ringabal> YA LIKE JAZZ
[1:02:42] <%aBlueWizard> Roche is 3rd, but probably because of his behaviors and not power.
[1:02:42] <%lucaflowe> He's 3rd
[1:02:44] <%Dwarven_Gaming> nope, hes thrid
[1:02:44] <%PocketChange117> the bench survived the paltefall
[1:02:44] <%ScottishMadJacko> Nah, 3rd
[1:02:45] <%furiousfurioso> was he 3A?
[1:02:45] <%pureotome> he's 3rd
[1:02:45] <%amiroodude> He's 3-C
[1:02:45] <%Axellogic> Roche was 3-C
[1:02:45] <%cowardman93> he's 3rd Class A rank
[1:02:48] <%Dwarven_Gaming> third*
[1:02:48] <%Nobrev> roche was 3rd
[1:02:52] <%sporeian94> Roche is crazt
[1:02:52] <%PR0swagonist> Roche is probably held back in 3rd class cuz he can't help killing people to promote to 2nd.
[1:02:54] <%boki_86> Roche has a Name
[1:02:56] <%boogaleeboo> the motorcycle gives him power
[1:02:58] <%cvp5127> maybe roche was held back
[1:02:59] <%42nfl19> DISC 5
[1:03:00] <%rufus2k2> and i believe it's because it's because he's hard to work with, rather than a question of skill
[1:03:01] <%ScottishMadJacko> Think hes a higher tier of 3 though
[1:03:01] <%tigerfang86> he's 3rd but he's probably 3rd cause he's a jackass and doesnt get promotions
[1:03:01] <%Dwarven_Gaming> no, he was 3-c
[1:03:04] <%rufus2k2> or that
[1:03:05] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Save
[1:03:05] <%SpcOpsBear> OH SHIT, THE SAVE POINT LOGO
[1:03:06] <%Mr_Pylon> Roche is too crazy to get a promotion
[1:03:10] <%j0ustar> Roche is one of those that doesn't care to ascend ranks most like
[1:03:10] <%sporeian94> Can't wait for Chocobo Race Duel with Roche in the sequel. IT WILL HAPPEN
[1:03:11] <%boki_86> @PatStaresAt he has a name
[1:03:11] <%patriotrenegade> We got power levels now
[1:03:12] <%ScottishMadJacko> So they were c and hes probably higher
[1:03:12] <%Daskolin> Roche 3rd But on POWERSCALE of 2nd. Like Zack was 2nd but on power level of 1st
[1:03:13] <%SpcOpsBear> The save point logo is on the bench!
[1:03:14] <%Masamune195> what is the ranking system for soldier. wtheck
[1:03:19] <%GohanHitsugaya> Oh lawd he comin
[1:03:27] <%Aracon_> he's certainly....insane
[1:03:29] <%Dragon_Batman> Perfect candidate for promotions
[1:03:30] <%CrookedSpiral> psaGib psaGib
[1:03:31] <%Balsty> oh my god i never noticed the save logo on the bench
[1:03:34] <%CelioHogane> It's very likelly that Roche is upper tier second class in terms of powers, but since he follows no orders and is not insane, can't go further
[1:03:34] <%siamzero94> probably too dumb to be 2nd
[1:03:35] <+Remery_> Roche is the best tho
[1:03:35] <%PR0swagonist> all soldiers are crazy, just look at Cloud
[1:03:40] <%patriotrenegade> Was Zack second class?
[1:03:40] <%starotter70> Zack was like, the only normal one
[1:03:41] <%televisedrevolting> Roche was held back to burning down his last Soldier Academy with Motorcycle fuel.
[1:03:41] <%YakumoYomi> "Mental instability"? He just wants to fuck his bike, is all.
[1:03:41] <%Frostilk> maybe wrong kinda crazy?
[1:03:45] <%ringabal> Maybe Roche was the Master of Masters after all?
[1:03:45] <%boogaleeboo> Big crazy and anime makes the number go down
[1:03:50] <%Meow0369> He has a cool bike
[1:03:52] <%boki_86> @Daskolin Zack was 1st in the end
[1:03:53] <%croxeye> psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep
[1:03:55] <%SH1NK1R0> I bet in future games he gets promoted or something

[1:04:16] <%cowardman93> I would love for Roche to come back in a future part
[1:04:16] <%Keyd00d> Roche is the new final boss
[1:04:21] <%KawaiiJetty> Roche killed 2 security officers and destroyed a bunch of sweepers, clearly he's going to get promoted
[1:04:22] <+Remery_> Roche and Sephiroth, tag-team Cloud LuvBlush
[1:04:30] <%patriotrenegade> Oh yeah, Roche’s VA showed up in chat when Max fought him.
[1:04:35] <%YakumoYomi> @rufus2k2 That's fucking amazing. My next playthrough will definitely be in Japanese
[1:04:36] <%cowardman93> Emlo attack the mic
[1:04:37] <%CelioHogane> @rolfalex they are military ranks, actually.

[1:05:05] <%Daskolin> @boki_86 Yeah, but even when he was in 2nd. He was as strong as 1st
[1:05:06] <%patriotrenegade> More important than money?
[1:05:08] <%Guardiansaiyan> Elmo new MOD
[1:05:09] <%코코꾸라> HELP ME, GORDON
[1:05:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Elmo is a Generous God
[1:05:11] <%MrBorisMakarov> BAN ME ELMO
[1:05:12] <%ringabal> It gives hime power
[1:05:12] <%furiousfurioso> rravHotban
[1:05:13] <%sporeian94> I would be honored to be banned by Elmo
[1:05:14] <%Storm_Samurai> Confused. Did Pat not talk about the ending of the game on the podcast?
[1:05:15] <%ConLin_Arts_> let him judge us
[1:05:18] <%j0ustar> Elmo, the incarnation of the ban hammer
[1:05:20] <%amiroodude> Ban the money
[1:05:21] <%Piemen99> BABY HAS THE HAMMER
[1:05:21] <%rolfalex> @celiohogane so just promotions
[1:05:23] <%aBlueWizard> What bothers me is not that these buildings survived, but that there's nothing inside of them. Were they under construction?
[1:05:25] <%starotter70> Elmo has too much power
[1:05:26] <+Remery_> Elmo is a mod!
[1:05:28] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Storm_Samurai he didn't cause he hasn't finished it eyt
[1:05:31] <%pynkdoe> elmo is judge, jury and executioner
[1:05:33] <%CelioHogane> @rolfalex Yes
[1:05:39] <+PlagueOfGripes> That's SO Barret!
[1:05:39] <%Storm_Samurai> @Guardiansaiyan Ah thank you very much
[1:05:51] <%rolfalex> @celiohogane thank you
[1:05:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> Elmo has gone mad withpower
[1:06:03] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Pat said last week he wouldn't finish FF7R until either today or tomorrow depending.
[1:06:07] <%ConLin_Arts_> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:06:07] <%Axellogic> Both go to same place PAT
[1:06:08] <%Dragon_Batman> Deduction
[1:06:08] <%prism_zet> ropes
[1:06:09] <%SH1NK1R0> @rolfalex class technically a standard military rank system but there have only ever been like 5 first classes ever and they were all super anime gods so it often feels predetermined. The classes tend to represent overall strength
[1:06:11] <%prism_zet> go ropes
[1:06:12] <%CelioHogane> @rolfalex example, in CC, Zack starts at Second class, eventually goes up
[1:06:12] <%Mr_Pylon> rope is side path
[1:06:15] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> this is the way forward, turn back
[1:06:23] <%Axellogic> Do the grapple one
[1:06:24] <%prism_zet> rooooopes
[1:06:24] <%superstarsage> I mean your main quest updated, so turn around?
[1:06:33] <%Piemen99> how did a car get her
[1:06:38] <+PlagueOfGripes> you cannot finish today
[1:06:40] <%Meow0369> Missed item
[1:06:51] <%ringabal> @PlagueOfGripes Not with that attitude

[1:07:01] <%thebetterbard> hey guys
[1:07:05] <%j0ustar> Emo says: Fuck you Dad!
[1:07:09] <%thebetterbard> o i'm late
[1:07:20] <%thebetterbard> I just got the follow notification
[1:07:21] <%amiroodude> Shit i missed that
[1:07:27] <%rolfalex> this is half the reason I watch streams, people with more than my basic bitch knowledge
[1:07:33] <%Dreadlord134> Dreadlord134 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Yo just beat this Sunday night I liked the end some exciting stuff. Don’t worry about the level you are stronger than I was at this point in the game
[1:07:40] <%CelioHogane> @thebetterbard you missed some dumb shit
[1:07:51] <%prism_zet> I missed those stairs for about fifteen minutes, blind
[1:07:52] <%Aracon_> it's better this way
[1:07:52] <%amused_platypus> Its certainly not the one ring
[1:08:05] <%Sir_stride> fuuuuuuuck this enemy
[1:08:06] <%Aracon_> they throw a lot of enemies at you in the end game so it works out
[1:08:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I'm also a tad late so I guess I too missed some dumb shit
[1:08:08] <%j0ustar> watch Pat die on stream anyway
[1:08:09] <%LokimenD> Can't wait for all those levels to be gone in part two Kappa
[1:08:10] <%thebetterbard> damb I guess I'll catch the Vod
[1:08:14] <%spiritofmojave> this one sucks ass for melee
[1:08:20] <%Meow0369> So I did a bit of grinding off screen
[1:08:22] <@SoFarFetched> @thebetterbard Yeah twitch is never reliable on notifications. Always good to check Pat's twitter because he announces on there when he's going live. Looking at the schedule is helpful too SeemsGood
[1:08:34] <%siamzero94> considering the upcoming boss, it's better you are tougher than normal
[1:08:36] <%KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Do you have any future gaming streams planned, or not for now?
[1:08:51] <%Balsty> here comes the money shot
[1:08:57] <%Dreadlord134> Actually has pat been spoiled yet? I know WoolieVersus and him did the podcast do they already know the end?
[1:09:00] <%thebetterbard> did pat look at the jpeg yet?
[1:09:02] <%rufus2k2> really big shout outs to some of the sound design, especially Barret's 1-2-3 burst
[1:09:05] <%Sir_stride> yup
[1:09:07] <%Aydarkzero> The Tower wins
[1:09:07] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> ha
[1:09:12] <%DukeBlack_> no
[1:09:12] <%tigerfang86> Tower Wins
[1:09:13] <%rufus2k2> no, you weirdo
[1:09:13] <%Axellogic> The drakengard?
[1:09:13] <%Guardiansaiyan> The background looks like a modern Zanarkand ruin
[1:09:14] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> But then there wouldn't be a story.

[1:09:34] <%Aydarkzero> But that's not how the story went Kappa
[1:09:35] <%Aracon_> see but then they would introduce time travel to not lose in such a shitty way
[1:09:37] <%rufus2k2> the last boss of Contra for Wii is a ball of trash
[1:09:38] <%CelioHogane> Isn't that Nier Automata true ending?
[1:09:40] <%Alazull> Ah yis entering the endgame

[1:10:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> I thought Nier Automata ended with the universe collapsing into a singularity because of how THICC 2B's ass is.
[1:10:41] <@SoFarFetched> The plate did so much damage it turned everything into a JPEG.

[1:15:15] <%Reveresao> Why no 4K jpeg
[1:15:18] <%Guardiansaiyan> that JPEG is from the original FFVII pre rendered mostalgia graphics!
[1:15:21] <%Guardiansaiyan> be nice!

[1:15:32] <%NeonNobleKalzeria> I thought they were really good looking but then again I was across the room from my TV
[1:15:35] <%CelioHogane> why no 4k JPEG? BECAUSE THE GAME WAS ALREADY 100 GB
[1:15:36] <%KawaiiJetty> Imagine if there were no invisible walls
[1:15:37] <%Aeoneth> Barret*
[1:15:40] <%tigerfang86> LARGE LAD
[1:15:40] <%Balsty> gotta love these pre rendered backgrounds
[1:15:41] <%walnutcast> no idea why the subreddit hates this game so much. it's really really good
[1:15:47] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt So THAT'S why FF7R runs so well on my PS4
[1:15:48] <@mothmandraws> still feels like they needed to layer the jpgs, to get some minor paralax scrolling
[1:15:50] <%Excel83Gaming> I hated this part
[1:15:51] <%sporeian94> It's Todd Howard!

[1:17:06] <%Alazull> Oh you can get stunlocked on the stairs
[1:17:10] <%aBlueWizard> This song TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo
[1:17:10] <%walnutcast> @siamzero94 i saw so much complaining on the sub, it was a bummer. but i just finished the game and the ending was weird as hell so i can understand that i guess LUL
[1:17:38] <%Alazull> Oh hey my least favorite enemy in the game
[1:17:40] <%Meow0369> The sub is a circlejerk against the game, I'd just avoid it for the time being there's no rational discourse going on there
[1:17:44] <%Alazull> Use magics
[1:17:51] <%rufus2k2> getting Droideka vibes from this
[1:17:54] <%lionandfox21> You got thunder dude?
[1:17:55] <%Balsty> cast the thunder for big attack
[1:18:03] <%siamzero94> @walnutcast same here, i thought 95% of the game is ace. Still i overall enjoyed the experience
[1:18:04] <%CelioHogane> Just wait, in a year everybody will be like OH GOD THIS GAME IS SO GOOD, GIVE ME PART 2 ALREADY
[1:18:06] <%Dragon_Batman> They are robots
[1:18:08] <%ringabal> Don't you love enemies that make you WAIT
[1:18:08] <%KawaiiJetty> Big juggle
[1:18:10] <%walnutcast> @Meow0369 good point it can get bad in there lol
[1:18:12] <%CursedNobleman> plaguevoice: too many people use the media they like as a piece of their identity. thats the cause of all the FF7 salt
[1:18:13] <%weissguard> Now that's a juggle.
[1:18:23] <+PlagueOfGripes> AI in this game loves to aggro whoever the human is controlling, and input read interrupt anything that might be fun
[1:18:25] <%Alazull> It'd be awesome if that field was only up while it was staggered, but it can lead to some real horseshit moments
[1:18:32] <%Aeoneth> @CelioHogane I'm already like that
[1:18:36] <%Balsty> he used the thunder
[1:18:37] <%lionandfox21> big brain move
[1:18:40] <%CursedNobleman> shit, i feel like i summoned plague.
[1:18:46] <%Piemen99> BANG
[1:18:51] <%Mr_Pylon> The party does need more Poise
[1:18:51] <%tigerfang86> you...... did it
[1:18:55] <%CelioHogane> @Aeoneth were you complaining like a little bitch on the reddit?
[1:19:01] <%Aeoneth> nope
[1:19:05] <%CelioHogane> then you don't count
[1:19:11] <%Aeoneth> Loved every second of this game
[1:19:11] <%KawaiiJetty> Seems less annoying than Monodrive MkII
[1:19:13] <%Balsty> but plague, switching characters constantly is the fun part
[1:19:13] <Hoot_Patoots> Hoot_Patoots subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:19:13] <@SoFarFetched> Think they were talking ab out the "give me part 2 already"
[1:19:30] <%Aeoneth> indeed I was
[1:19:30] <%snugglepuggs> Helitroops still look stupid
[1:19:32] <%Hoot_Patoots> eyyyyy
[1:19:33] <%Meow0369> @SoFarFetched what?
[1:19:35] <%PanicSwytch> Naruto's can fly?
[1:19:39] <%Daskolin> @PlagueOfGripes Yeah i understand they want you to change characters. But thats a bad way to doing it honestly. Also input reading is REAL
[1:19:41] <%Meow0369> I don't get what you mean farfetched
[1:19:49] <%SH1NK1R0> Best part is that based on trophy percentages even if you factor in offline users leaves maybe 30-40% of players actually having beaten it yet they all have such strong opinions on a game they clearly haven’t beaten and many haven’t played
[1:19:52] <%NitronStreams> Fighting robots in a ruined city sure reminds me of some other Square enix action rpg
[1:19:52] <%rufus2k2> speaking of Naruto, remake Yuffie will probably be insane
[1:19:55] <%CelioHogane> I want half of part 2 to be new story shit in costa del sol
[1:19:57] <%DeoxysPrime> Helitroops have big "spinning lightsaber flying" energy
[1:20:04] <@SoFarFetched> @Meow0369 Celio Confused Aeonath as being the person complaining when Aeonath was actually saying "im the people wanting Part 2 already"

[1:21:39] <%NeonNobleKalzeria> I think part 2 will have significantly less expansion on the world so it's possible we go all the way to disc 1's original end

[1:22:32] <%CelioHogane> @CursedNobleman i mean, they can take as long as they want with the original content if they keep pumping new content and shit. If it takes 4 games to reach Aerith best acting scene, whatever, it's still 4 good games.
[1:22:33] <%broth_elemental> Jpeg bar

[1:22:51] <+PlagueOfGripes> the price will be sex under the Highwind while everyone watches. The time ghosts will ensure that happens
[1:22:52] <%Aeoneth> @CursedNobleman Aparently Part 2 was already underway. And with Nibelheim being COMPLETELY done already (based on the cutscenes) who knows how much is already done. I wouldn't be suprised to see Part 2 within a year or 2. Bit yeah I don;t think they'll get beyond disk 1
[1:22:56] <%Hoot_Patoots> oh this track is good, i forgot about it
[1:22:58] <%ShichiNoBushi> The real price was the friends we made along the way.

[1:23:56] <%iosephe> It's fine you don't have to jump
[1:24:00] <%Verd_254> it would appear, based on the jpg, that the section you actually see is relatively untouched compared to the rest of the sector.

[1:24:24] <%aBlueWizard> This damn ace combat music

[1:29:02] <%Aracon_> holy strong tifa
[1:29:03] <%SpcOpsBear> @Dreadlord134 As someone who has an ASD (Asperger's), it's easy to see some social anxieties in Cloud's behavior that I can relate to, but that's all from his mental state, not his neurodevelopment.
[1:29:03] <%CelioHogane> WHY YOU THREW IT CLOUD
[1:29:04] <%Chichen> I dont think thats how Grappling Hooks work but I'm not an expert

[1:29:22] <%rontopronto> Teamwork makes the Dreamwork
[1:29:22] <%Meow0369> Tifa is arguably stronger than barret
[1:29:23] <%Bluwizard21> cloud threw away his grappling hook

[1:33:57] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Don't let Eli upset you, he gave this game a solid 8.1/10 for "dog turd on an ice-cream"!
[1:34:00] <%Maids4lyfe> it was cut due to technology shit
[1:34:00] <%42nfl19> IS IT THE ANTI-RETCON GHOSTS?
[1:34:01] <%SaiyanShoto> Almost like this makes way more sense
[1:34:02] <%lionandfox21> FF7 is goofy
[1:34:04] <%Alazull> Also fun fact, in the OG game Wutai is occupied, not under a cease fire
[1:34:06] <%Meow0369> They couldn't afford to render more than 5 characters alongside cloud's buff arms

[1:37:46] <%MakotoPB> The helmets reduce the vertical visibility
[1:37:47] <%marchums> Theyre helmets mess with there up vision
[1:37:47] <%rufus2k2> HAPPY NOW PAT
[1:37:47] <%Mr_Pylon> Shinra only hires the biggest and umberest stumbos around
[1:37:47] <%Reveresao> Just like gamers they don't look up
[1:37:47] <%SaiyanShoto> Their helmets are in the way
[1:37:48] <%tigerfang86> B A R R E T
[1:37:49] <%Laecerelius> Stupidity all around
[1:37:49] <%Hoot_Patoots> Guard: "Must've been my imagination"
[1:37:50] <%gespenst25> @patstaresat they aren't paid enough to look up
[1:37:50] <%LokimenD> NotLikeThis
[1:37:52] <%pynkdoe> pat has no right to talk about someone being blind psaBlind
[1:37:52] <%Meow0369> do you remember the tbag sequence in the original?

[1:37:59] <%goose_attack_almanac> THE TRUCK IS GONE\
[1:38:00] <%rufus2k2> DON'T PUT THAT ON BARRET EVEN IF IT IS HIS FAULT
[1:38:01] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> THAT'S how they get caught?
[1:38:01] <%Alazull> They are really going for Barret being a lovable idiot
[1:38:06] <%Laecerelius> It's less about who's the best and more about who's less of a dipshit at this point
[1:38:07] <%HunguyTV> Is the gang just a bunch of chests?
[1:38:08] <%tigerfang86> NOTHIN
[1:38:12] <%zeif00> I'd pass out if Barret sat on me
[1:38:13] <%tigerfang86> NOTHING WRONG HERE
[1:38:14] <%luftraumm1> no cameras?
[1:38:16] <%valkuma> Fira - Magnify - basement over
[1:38:17] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt Pat misses a chest several times and then yells at guards for being blind psaBlind
[1:38:25] <%rufus2k2> SHOW ME YOUR HANDS! "BARRET: Kappa Kappa
[1:38:27] <+PlagueOfGripes> for fun, don't tell Pat about the chest in the building and see if he finds it! for fun!
[1:38:28] <%luftraumm1> oh screw stealth
[1:38:29] <%Visorak6> No pat the guards were pretending they didnt see so they wouldn't have to fight them and die
[1:38:35] <%ringabal> GHOST RANK
[1:38:42] <%Dragon_Batman> You know he won't find it
[1:38:43] <%KawaiiJetty> Barret needs a silencer on his gun
[1:38:44] <%Alazull> This muzac doe
[1:38:45] <%tigerfang86> LMAO
[1:38:46] <%lord_traxis> Could you imagine being the guy Tifa landed on haha? How embarrassing would that have been? haha haha
[1:38:48] <%amused_platypus> steal the bikes
[1:38:49] <%Vohs_Bru> was there combat?
[1:38:49] <%PhantomMiG> Look at those old timey cars
[1:38:50] <%spiritofmojave> That actually makes sense
[1:38:52] <%Balsty> thats the best headcanon
[1:38:55] <%Hoot_Patoots> Barret is almost as big as the truck he was on
[1:38:55] <%BeatBo_2> makes more sense actually
[1:38:56] <%MildConviction> @PatStaresAt FYI, this small series of fights is the best place to grind to level 50 in post-game.
[1:38:56] <%KaiserMario> Eyesight is hard during strrem
[1:38:57] <%majindusto> "Missed" a Chest that I refuse that he didn't see
[1:38:57] <%SaiyanShoto> He’ll never find that cheat
[1:38:57] <%Bluwizard21> the batman in the bedroom scene
[1:39:00] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> So the guards were Pat
[1:39:00] <%BeatBo_2> see some weird freaks on a car
[1:39:01] <%tigerfang86> @lord_traxis haha yeah that would be REAL embarassing hahaha
[1:39:01] <%luftraumm1> best headcanon
[1:39:02] <%lionandfox21> Dont they all have Pat vision ?
[1:39:04] <%unstablebeast19> or their helmets suck for looking up
[1:39:05] <%BeatBo_2> don't want none of that
[1:39:05] <%Frost_Quill> Haha, can you imagine Tifa falling on you? Who would want that haha.
[1:39:05] <%SummonerMagno> guards be like "dont get paid enough for that"
[1:39:07] <%rufus2k2> @Bluwizard21 beat me to it
[1:39:09] <%Guardiansaiyan> nope
[1:39:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> That's what happens when you have a passive +50 on Intimidate
[1:39:12] <%Guardiansaiyan> nope out
[1:39:13] <%Mornaka> Then take the elevator
[1:39:14] <%boki_86> @PatStaresAt try it
[1:39:14] <+PlagueOfGripes> that sort of happens later
[1:39:15] <%Aracon_> LUL
[1:39:17] <%Laecerelius> Like that one thug with Batman?
[1:39:20] <%Mr_Pylon> There's a great bit in a Batman cartoon where that exactly happens with a patrolling good.
[1:39:20] <%GohanHitsugaya> That would be great
[1:39:22] <%Mr_Pylon> goon
[1:39:25] <%Meow0369> @PlagueOfGripes Really? I don't remember that part
[1:39:26] <%XenomorphicTendencies> the force awakens scene with the stormtroopers
[1:39:27] <%starotter70> Not Today
[1:39:28] <%Visorak6> "I dont get paid enough for this shit"
[1:39:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I always love that bit in movies.
[1:39:31] <%NitronStreams> i mean Cloud alone has killed like at least a hundred Shinra goons by now
[1:39:31] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Laecerelius that was a great clip
[1:39:32] <%starotter70> It's Friday
[1:39:33] <%Frostilk> "If you see someone who looks like a protagonist, turn and run the other way"
[1:39:33] <%Bluwizard21> I'd ignore a guy with a sword wider than my chest
[1:39:34] <%Fenrirlives> doodRage THIS PARTY IS GETTIN CURAZEH
[1:39:35] <%Meow0369> @PlagueOfGripes Is that what happens if you don't take the stairs
[1:39:38] <%Alazull> Or just exhales, says "Above my pay grade." and walks away
[1:39:40] <%sporeian94> I make 10gil/hr, I don't get paid enough for this
[1:39:42] <%Aracon_> "I'm new here....I never signed up for this shit"
[1:39:45] <%boki_86> @PatStaresAt save and try stairs an elevator
[1:39:48] <%Vohs_Bru> 2 days until retirement
[1:39:49] <%tigerfang86> DAMN THAT MUSIC
[1:39:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> THIS FUCKING MUSIC IS UGHHHHHHHHHHH
[1:39:52] <@mothmandraws> basically what happens if you go to uldah/mor dhona in 2.5, no one wants to arrest you
[1:39:58] <%boogaleeboo> Stairs are all that matters, you know this is true
[1:40:01] <%valriot> Isnt the official OST like 8 disks?
[1:40:06] <%Alazull> Yes
[1:40:07] <%Meow0369> Yes
[1:40:11] <%Hoot_Patoots> it might be the first time i'll buy a physical OST
[1:40:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hunter 3-4 you lost contact is everything okay? Barret 'Uh, had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you?'
[1:40:16] <%PanicSwytch> I need to buy the ost
[1:40:23] <%spiritofmojave> 8 disks for 77.77$ x.x
[1:40:26] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> If Jessie lived they would have a Gokudara from Reborn. Bomb people are cool
[1:40:30] <%Big_McLarge_Huge> 8 discs for just part 1
[1:40:31] <%majindusto> THE SOUNDTRACK TO THIS GAME IS 100% FANTASTIC
[1:40:34] <%Balsty> do these soldier guys seem kinda...messed up?
[1:40:42] <%CursedNobleman> @valriot dists 5-8 is the 8 hour extended remix of Hip Hop de Chocobo LUL
[1:40:45] <%rufus2k2> LOL
[1:41:02] <@Mechz71> actually the Shinra helmets do look like they'd obscure your vision looking upa bit so that truck part is kinda believable
[1:41:03] <%PanicSwytch> Honestly $77 for the ost is worth it so far
[1:41:04] <%CelioHogane> "YOU ARE GOOD AT THIS" "TOLD YOU SO"
[1:41:10] <%therealgirthman> Imagine being a Shinra jobber and getting fucking beaten to death by a bartender with huge tits
[1:41:17] <%Nobody404> @Mechz71 yeah but why would they make the helmets like that
[1:41:20] <%spiritofmojave> @panicswytch Oh it's worth just HOLY SHIT that's hard to afford rn
[1:41:21] <%tigerfang86> Dogs HATE explosions
[1:41:21] <%rufus2k2> OH GOD DOG GRENADE
[1:41:24] <%코코꾸라> @therealgirthman god I wish
[1:41:24] <%wsintai> @therealgirthman Talk about living the dream
[1:41:26] <%spiritofmojave> of all times yknow
[1:41:28] <%rufus2k2> IT'S WW2 RUSSIA ALL OVER AGAIN
[1:41:28] <%toastybites> Stretch some more Tifa ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[1:41:28] <%valriot> @therealgirthman I wish
[1:41:29] <%CursedNobleman> id rather be strangled by a snake lady. @therealgirthman
[1:41:30] <%Hoot_Patoots> THAT'S AL OT OF SPARKS
[1:41:31] <%tigerfang86> JESUS
[1:41:32] <%majindusto> I am so excited to get that OST
[1:41:33] <%starotter70> They better get paid WELL
[1:41:34] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @therealgirthman Livin da dream
[1:41:34] <@mothmandraws> I think they were just lazy checking
[1:41:39] <%KawaiiJetty> wtf is happening
[1:41:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @therealgirthman A death worthy of valhalla
[1:41:52] <%Hoot_Patoots> Tifa you melted these people
[1:41:53] <%PanicSwytch> @spiritofmojave i agree very expensive
[1:41:54] <%rufus2k2> GODDAMN RECORD MORE LINES IN FF7R 2
[1:41:55] <%tigerfang86> just MAKE OUT ALREADY
[1:41:56] <%arcielardor> @patstaresat How do you think they turn planet life juice into electricity?
[1:42:13] <%Meow0369> black magic
[1:42:17] <%Vohs_Bru> I guess combat in the original was more transparent
[1:42:18] <%tigerfang86> Planet STEAM
[1:42:18] <%Alazull> Molotov cocktail inside evil corporate building, yeright
[1:42:19] <%therealgirthman> The souls of the dead run on Shinra treadmills to make it
[1:42:19] <@Mechz71> @Nobody404 same reason they make helicopter blade arms for some of their troopers lol
[1:42:19] <%Visorak6> they schlorp it up
[1:42:20] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Roche was a boss fight as a C3A, I'll be vastly annoyed is your first C2 is a normal jobber
[1:42:21] <%NeonNobleKalzeria> in the original, they condensed it somehow
[1:42:23] <%Malisin_Murder> SourPls
[1:42:23] <%Mornaka> blue magic?
[1:42:25] <%Laecerelius> They turn it into Lightning Materia?
[1:42:26] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Same way hydro power works
[1:42:26] <%Hoot_Patoots> it's got electrolytes, which the plants crave
[1:42:26] <%Aracon_> same way how wind turbines make electricity happen
[1:42:27] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Fun fact, nearly ALL your electricity is magic steam juice technically
[1:42:28] <%ShichiNoBushi> Using it for Fire magic to heat a boiler?
[1:42:29] <%spiritofmojave> Succ up that steam juice into energy
[1:42:29] <%valriot> As opposed to turning into balls that do magic bullshit
[1:42:29] <+crimsonharvest> crimsonharvest subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[1:42:30] <%worldbrand> we use steam to turn turbines in almost fucking EVERYTHING
[1:42:30] <%RetroCop87> Mako is flammable according to Jessie
[1:42:31] <%luftraumm1> petroleum?
[1:42:34] <%CelioHogane> WHEN I DIE I WANT MY PLANET JUICE TO BE TURNED INTO ELECTRICITY FOR A NINTENDO SWITCH
[1:42:36] <%lord_traxis> It's magic. I ain't gotta explain shit
[1:42:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> The soul becomes MP to cast Thundaga into some wires.
[1:42:43] <%Dakuu75> !uptime
[1:42:43] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 42m.
[1:42:46] <%Frost_Quill> They take the lifeblood of the planet to turn a small wheel and that's where they get their power. Highly inefficient, it's the Shinra way.
[1:42:46] <%sporeian94> Clean Burning Mako
[1:42:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ShichiNoBushi or Wind magic to turn a turbine
[1:42:52] <%rolfalex> didn't they just have coal before Mako
[1:42:53] <%Alazull> They refine the Lifestream into Mako, it's probably an oil analogue
[1:42:53] <%linSP> Mako is like mmmm ako
[1:42:56] <%crimsonharvest> they probably burn it to make steam
[1:42:58] <%Dakuu75> -I'm 2 hours late. fuck
[1:42:59] <%rufus2k2> Roche is a special case, he's held back by internal ogistics, not by ability
[1:43:01] <%PanicSwytch> What I want to know is how are summons created?
[1:43:02] <%sporeian94> I sell Mako and Mako Accessories
[1:43:03] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @worldbrand Yea, not enoguh people know this. They thinking Coal directly gives us energy lol
[1:43:05] <%rufus2k2> logistics*
[1:43:06] <%CursedNobleman> it makes no sense unless mako contains heat or some sort of convertible energy.
[1:43:07] <%ringabal> If you think about it, the Lifestream is basically LCL
[1:43:11] <%Aeoneth> Cloud is a bit confused
[1:43:13] <%CelioHogane> @rolfalex in Advent Children, Barret discovers Gasoline
[1:43:13] <%starotter70> Cloud wants his fucking money
[1:43:14] <%ScreamLord> Like how Nuclear is basically just Steam Power but with radioactive coal
[1:43:14] <%Vohs_Bru> was this remake was directed by Michael Bay??
[1:43:16] <%boogaleeboo> Advent Children has the most fucked up bit, where Barret discovers a new energy source to save the planet.....oil
[1:43:16] <%spiritofmojave> Some of us will have to sacrifice for preserving Mako Kappa
[1:43:17] <%wsintai> @CelioHogane No, you will be used to power someones vibrator
[1:43:21] <%ShichiNoBushi> @doc_ock_rokc Or (I can't believe we both missed this) Thunder magic.
[1:43:28] <%lionandfox21> @PanicSwytch its later in the game that you see it explained
[1:43:32] <%CelioHogane> @wsintai only if that person is fucking ugly or a twink
[1:43:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ShichiNoBushi Too easy
[1:43:34] <%valriot> I love that you can switch while theyre in mid combo and keep it going, shits rad
[1:43:34] <%boogaleeboo> Like holy shit did that miss the point
[1:43:36] <%Guardiansaiyan> @boogaleeboo I read that book! Hope they find green energy soon!
[1:43:47] <%Aeoneth> @wsintai ... can it be Scarlets
[1:43:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> @boogaleeboo OOF SIZE: LARGE
[1:43:54] <%CelioHogane> @wsintai it MUST be depressing!
[1:43:54] <%Alazull> Shinra is very interested in re-opening the Mako economy as soon as possible
[1:43:54] <%Balsty> not like this!
[1:43:57] <%Hoot_Patoots> @boogaleeboo oh my god i completely forgot about that and that's so painful
[1:44:00] <%Frost_Quill> @boogaleeboo At least running out of oil doesn't literally kill all life and use up your ancestors souls to cook a pizza.
[1:44:00] <%SvenHolgersson> YOU KILLED TOMAR
[1:44:01] <%Excel83Gaming> Man these SOLDIERs are kinda bitches, huh?
[1:44:02] <%spiritofmojave> @boogaleeboo ohhhhh NOOOOO
[1:44:04] <%KasiCrafter> NotLikeThis
[1:44:07] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt These Jobber Soldiers look way cooler than Cloud
[1:44:07] <%wsintai> @Aeoneth Sure, but she isnt using it on herself
[1:44:10] <%spiritofmojave> why Advent Children
[1:44:11] <%Sir_stride> NotLikeThis
[1:44:12] <%Alazull> Mako prices have sunk to under $1 a barrel
[1:44:14] <%Nordguy> has mr patrick gotten to the New Shit yet?
[1:44:14] <%tigerfang86> SO FAST
[1:44:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Because of Avalanche the cost of mako has become negitive!
[1:44:20] <%tigerfang86> the murder was BLAZING SPEEDS
[1:44:23] <%siamzero94> where they?
[1:44:24] <%Aeoneth> @wsintai awww yeah. Harem action
[1:44:25] <%segonian> so why is Tifa so strong? is there an in universe reason?
[1:44:25] <@SoFarFetched> Bless you Paige.
[1:44:29] <%Nobody404> @PatStaresAt the guys earlier said they couldnt get into contact with HQ
[1:44:30] <%siamzero94> *were
[1:44:32] <%ringabal> YEAH YOU MADE IT
[1:44:33] <%gespenst25> one guard said they couldn't get through on the ratio
[1:44:33] <%valriot> @segonian Boobs
[1:44:37] <%Balsty> take the escalator
[1:44:41] <%Keyd00d> Zangan is a good teacher
[1:44:42] <%nmaten> go up the down escalator
[1:44:43] <%sporeian94> STAIRS NOT ESCALATORS
[1:44:44] <%starotter70> Nice Big Sentence

[1:50:47] <%cowardman93> look Tifa, Mats
[1:50:47] <%rufus2k2> who could be responsible Kappa
[1:50:47] <+PlagueOfGripes> I'm still curious why those mats are there
[1:50:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> eat shit bitch
[1:50:47] <%Aydarkzero> i knew you'd be fine if you landed on your butt
[1:50:48] <%valriot> @pipboy344 Maybe 2 hours, depends how dumb Pat is
[1:50:48] <%Malisin_Murder> psaCrazy
[1:50:49] <%Keyd00d> This part is slow and sucks. Nice music tho
[1:50:49] <%Guardiansaiyan> @pipboy344 couple hours minimum
[1:50:49] <%mechslayer71> There’s a weapon in this part @patstaresat
[1:50:50] <%gespenst25> good job pat
[1:50:50] <%Meow0369> @GeneralSCPatton sure but in this game it's literally souls, in real life I doubt you're gonna find many people who claim mummies have their souls in em still or are impacted by the state of their dead body
[1:50:51] <%GohanHitsugaya> Get chest!
[1:50:52] <%KawaiiJetty> Tifa's ass is solid
[1:50:53] <%Verd_254> she wasn't aiming for the next platform she was going for the rope
[1:50:54] <%Frost_Quill> Tifa you jump higher to punch robots.
[1:50:58] <%cowardman93> no
[1:50:58] <%wsintai> @PlagueOfGripes Sometimes you gotta fuck in the lobby
[1:51:00] <%ScottishMadJacko> Honestly this section feels pointless
[1:51:01] <%spiritofmojave> This whole part is fanservice
[1:51:01] <%sporeian94> Tifa now has a cracked ass
[1:51:02] <%Guardiansaiyan> @PlagueOfGripes they are benches
[1:51:03] <%42nfl19> Those are fancy flat couches that some buildings have
[1:51:07] <%Laecerelius> The mats are there to break the fall of super hot punch girls
[1:51:08] <%Cburg91> Boy Tifa was lucky that a couch was placed just right there for here. /s
[1:51:10] <%Dakuu75> Tifa, I've seen you jump like 30 feet into the air... stop dicking around
[1:51:13] <%worldbrand> oh i missed that one
[1:51:14] <%Dragon_Batman> Running start
[1:51:21] <%Axellogic> So with this sequence the question isn begged. Why cant I swap which character I control normally.

[1:51:24] <%Aracon_> uhhhhh plot convenience :)
[1:51:25] <%CelioHogane> Oh hey, a chest with CLOUD'S PAY FOR BOMBING A REACTOR.
[1:51:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> The lamp absorbes momentum
[1:51:27] <%MakotoPB> god the fucking lighting attention to detail on her exposed midsection is insane
[1:51:28] <%abakkus> when do the shadows start showing up
[1:51:29] <+PlagueOfGripes> just in case you fall

[1:51:49] <%Frost_Quill> Tifa just wants to show off for Cloud. Wants to guzzle that rainwater later.
[1:51:50] <%siamzero94> let's see how long pat takes for this
[1:51:54] <%lionandfox21> the cars Pat
[1:51:54] <%RedKnightVI> Jump on car
[1:51:55] <%CelioHogane> @SoFarFetched Why not GUNS WITH TRAINS?
[1:51:56] <%Keyd00d> Don't miss the purple chest like I did while hanging
[1:52:00] <%Zutrax> This took me ages to figure out
[1:52:00] <%sporeian94> climb on the cars!
[1:52:00] <%DukeBlack_> @Axellogic cutscenes are in game. Cloud would have to run super fast or teleport to be in the scene and that would look weird.
[1:52:01] <%Excel83Gaming> Look at that MGS2 wall
[1:52:01] <%ALazo> This part was very boring

[1:55:38] <%bread_assassin> It's my favorite.
[1:55:38] <%GohanHitsugaya> Get all those Materia slots!
[1:55:39] <%boogaleeboo> For a lot of builds it just MELTS
[1:55:40] <%therealgirthman> STANDO
[1:55:44] <+Remery_> Crit Gloves
[1:55:45] <%RyanTheRecluse> ALSO LOOK AT ITS SKILL
[1:55:47] <%linSP> luck build?
[1:55:48] <%baronblank> until late hard mode, it is pretty much, besides maybe metal knuckles
[1:55:51] <%ringabal> Oh no
[1:55:52] <%DeoxysPrime> More pinkish really
[1:55:52] <%spiritofmojave> BIG. CRIT.
[1:55:56] <%Keyd00d> The best one I have to go back and get :(
[1:55:56] <%Aracon_> obviously not the highest raw damage, but those crits pile up real fast
[1:55:59] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Those gloves DO NOT match her boots
[1:56:00] <+PlagueOfGripes> you can only get this thing in this little sequence. right after this you can look right at it but the game won't let you have it. not great
[1:56:02] <%luftraumm1> ugly tho
[1:56:03] <%starotter70> It's pink with some purple
[1:56:03] <%Axellogic> May want to upgrade it
[1:56:05] <%Mr_Pylon> The best one
[1:56:06] <%siamzero94> mnegaton punch
[1:56:10] <%ringabal> Tiger Drop
[1:56:11] <%pynkdoe> theyre ugly take them off
[1:56:11] <%majindusto> PURPLE...RAIN
[1:56:15] <%GohanHitsugaya> It's a good skill
[1:56:16] <%amused_platypus> its made from behemoth skiln
[1:56:19] <%Hoot_Patoots> oh that's her infinity finisher
[1:56:20] <Nupinoop296> oh cute
[1:56:20] <+Remery_> Man I missed so many weapons
[1:56:21] <%supersugoisenpai1> useful weapon skill
[1:56:21] <%DeoxysPrime> Big stagger
[1:56:23] <%tizz86> @sofarfetched showing age that you mention it, or that i know it
[1:56:24] <%spiritofmojave> The ability is ok, but the pointa are better
[1:56:25] <%mechslayer71> The problem is that it is the best when you’re nearly dead, which is a bad place to be with Tifa @patstaresat ability is dope tho
[1:56:26] <%Bluwizard21> just watched a clip where a bald streamer is told he has a dent in his head from his headset, and he takes off this headset and sure enough there's a depression under it.
[1:56:28] <%worldbrand> it's no star shower
[1:56:29] <%valriot> Gimme that FFXIV monk bullshit
[1:56:31] <%KasiCrafter> >Bonus: Just hit them. 4Head
[1:56:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Red with pink? NUH UH BABY
[1:56:32] <%Malisin_Murder> SourPls
[1:56:33] <%ScottishMadJacko> Looks like magnetos gloves
[1:56:38] <%CelioHogane> Why did you put the weapon before unlocking the materia slots? XDDDDD
[1:56:40] <+Remery_> Tifa needs more palm strikes
[1:56:44] <%GohanHitsugaya> Yep
[1:56:49] <%pynkdoe> you cant fight crime if you dont look cute
[1:56:53] <%Dakuu75> what does it do? increase the stagger number more from 160? or jsut more dmg to a staggered opponent?
[1:57:03] <%Meow0369> psaBig_SQ
[1:57:04] <%Aeoneth> theres 1 more materia slot
[1:57:05] <%Aracon_> that concentration activation 70% is insanely good
[1:57:08] <%코코꾸라> Healing
[1:57:08] <%shadowace2400> fuck, I missed that one
[1:57:09] <%Balsty> MELD CRIT FOR BIG NUMBER
[1:57:09] <%Dragon_Batman> Just check the other weapon
[1:57:10] <%Zulrez> increase the stagger @Dakuu75
[1:57:11] <%valriot> Wtf is this man doing
[1:57:12] <%SilverDevilfish> psaBlind
[1:57:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> Cloud: What is taking her so long Barret:She is accessorizing Foo!
[1:57:17] <%GarbageQueenEllie> If this is her final weapon, her boots should change to match it. Fashion is more important than stats
[1:57:21] <%CelioHogane> @valriot the worst.
[1:57:23] <%mechslayer71> @dakuu75 30 percent increase per use. Her triangle moves also increase the multiplier
[1:57:23] <%Felto3> it a flat +30% to whatever the stagger bonus is
[1:57:25] <%marchums> Did he max out all the magic materias?
[1:57:25] <+PlagueOfGripes> could just swap to an old weapon and then back to this one
[1:57:29] <+PlagueOfGripes> should ask you
[1:57:32] <%Alazull> The only thing is it cannot hold as much Materia as Sonic Striker IIRC
[1:57:44] <%trianglehat> bless
[1:57:45] <%Keyd00d> How did you not know
[1:57:45] <%reinbachthe3rd> CORONA!
[1:57:48] <%narusao> gazoontite
[1:57:51] <%Dragon_Batman> LUL can never get over the muppet
[1:57:53] <%Dakuu75> oh so it's straight up more stagger, and if they're staggered all rdy, bigger-stagger-number. gotchya
[1:57:54] <%starotter70> Bless you kermit
[1:57:54] <%segonian> the question is if they will even let you play the next game without a save file for this one.
[1:57:55] <%ringabal> hurhurhur
[1:57:57] <%CelioHogane> THE STAND ARROW SNEEZE
[1:57:59] <%GohanHitsugaya> Gesundheirt
[1:58:05] <%SH1NK1R0> @alazull all weapons end up with the same slots so slots don’t actually matter
[1:58:05] <%mechslayer71> @alazull They all have the same amount of material at level 6
[1:58:13] <%PanicSwytch> Is pat kermit the frog
[1:58:14] <%reinbachthe3rd> Kreygasm
[1:58:17] <%Aracon_> big ups on criticals
[1:58:17] <%valriot> @segonian Pressumably yes, but just make Yuffie steal your shit
[1:58:18] <%RyanTheRecluse> speed
[1:58:25] <%luftraumm1> speed
[1:58:25] <%majindusto> GET ALL MATERIA SLOTS
[1:58:29] <%segonian> haha that makes sense.
[1:58:29] <%ringabal> I am speed
[1:58:31] <%spiritofmojave> Speed is pretty important i think for ATB
[1:58:37] <%Aeoneth> Why mo materia?
[1:58:38] <%LokimenD> You have more than 100 sp just get everything LUL
[1:58:39] <%Keyd00d> Yuffie steals your level ups at the beginning of 2
[1:58:41] <%Alazull> @SH1NK1R0 At Level 6 yeah maybe, but it does matter for a bit
[1:58:42] <%luftraumm1> more materia
[1:58:43] <%Balsty> Speed matters less than you might think
[1:58:44] <%GohanHitsugaya> Hm, needs more Materia...
[1:58:46] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> why no materia?
[1:58:52] <%mechslayer71> @lokimend It’s not enough
[1:58:55] <%CelioHogane> @segonian i hope they go the mass effect way of YES, KEEP LEVELS
[1:58:58] <%Scarnehu> hp and materia
[1:59:04] <%Aeoneth> Parry?
[1:59:06] <%Balsty> get damage and crit
[1:59:10] <@Mechz71> take as much time as you need so this soundtrack plays more
[1:59:10] <%majindusto> GET MORE
[1:59:10] <%Dragon_Batman> ONe more doesn't really hurt honestly
[1:59:17] <%SilverDevilfish> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:59:18] <%Metballs> Materia is literally just free stats
[1:59:23] <%RyanTheRecluse> purple materia is just free stats
[1:59:25] <%LokimenD> S P E E D
[1:59:28] <%Dakuu75> is 2-link the highest you can get in this game? there's no 3-link+?
[1:59:30] <%Garthunox> S P EE D
[1:59:38] <%CelioHogane> @Dakuu75 no
[1:59:44] <%MildConviction> The Tifa That Wouldn't Slow Down
[1:59:46] <%Dragon_Batman> I would say weapon ability and speed
[1:59:51] <%Garthunox> woolie you have to hit them
[1:59:51] <%CrookedSpiral> S P E E D UP
[2:00:03] <%arcielardor> there was another speed up as wl
[2:00:08] <%Balsty> Speed really matters less than you think
[2:00:09] <%Zombrocom> Gotta 6link your weapon slots so you can link all your gems together.. wait.
[2:00:16] <%GohanHitsugaya> Max HP+300 is pretty good...
[2:00:16] <%the_vedo_show> moon2SECRETEMOTE
[2:00:23] <%KaiserMario> Hey @PlagueOfGripes Don't you love this menu?
[2:00:25] <%Aracon_> speed is pretty irrelevant when you can give tifa parry
[2:00:26] <%코코꾸라> save the rest
[2:00:30] <%siamzero94> why not hop?
[2:00:32] <%ringabal> PERFECT
[2:00:34] <%CelioHogane> @Zombrocom MY PUNCHES HEAL ALL THE ENEMIES
[2:00:36] <%Balsty> PERFECT

[2:00:49] <%starotter70> Satiated psaGoblin
[2:00:50] <+PlagueOfGripes> yeah this menu is super good and makes my degree in graphic design feel really inferior to what's goin on here
[2:00:51] <%majindusto> WHY DO YOU AWAYS SAY HER NAME WRONG?
[2:00:53] <%Dragon_Batman> Wasn't there another crit boosts that didn't have an hp threshold?
[2:00:56] <%Aeoneth> T minus 5 mutes till Tifa levels up and its no longer -
[2:01:03] <%indig0bird> That's not bad but she becomes stronger with low HP
[2:01:05] <%Scarnehu> lightning
[2:01:07] <%KaiserMario> LUL
[2:01:09] <%Aracon_> give her parry
[2:01:09] <%42nfl19> He says it wrong cause it's funny
[2:01:13] <%Aeoneth> Recommend Parry
[2:01:15] <%Aracon_> her parry is insanely good
[2:01:18] <%RyanTheRecluse> luck since she's a critical build?
[2:01:18] <%za7az> Luck?
[2:01:25] <%Aeoneth> Parry is like playing a differewnt game
[2:01:26] <%GohanHitsugaya> Parry on Tifa is amazing!
[2:01:31] <%spiritofmojave> Multiple luck-ups
[2:01:31] <%Dragon_Batman> Luck would help with crit yea
[2:01:32] <%Balsty> ATB stagger is super good
[2:01:32] <%valriot> parry good since Tifa has no defensive skills otherwise
[2:01:34] <%zanzibar_junker> Parry
[2:01:35] <%GohanHitsugaya> PARRY!
[2:01:36] <%indig0bird> HP would make the window for +stats wider
[2:01:37] <%ultimatetotoro> @plagueofgripes i...i thought you majored in English?
[2:01:38] <%boogaleeboo> Parry or Luck is basically it

[2:01:51] <%spiritofmojave> nice

[2:02:28] <%valriot> LUL
[2:02:30] <%GohanHitsugaya> Parry on Tifa is a amazing, because you can spam it and fly around the map.
[2:02:30] <%CelioHogane> What if Tiffa pads her chest?
[2:02:31] <%Nupinoop296> no!!!
[2:02:31] <%tigerfang86> N o

[2:02:47] <%SH1NK1R0> @dakuu75 you should maybe check the manual in game. It lists every stat and status effect symbol. Luck is steal and crit rate.
[2:02:47] <%pureotome> ELI YES
[2:02:47] <%Ancopro> thats RIGHT

[2:03:00] <%Aracon_> no
[2:03:00] <%hzealot> you know what my fav thing in early gmae was? the barret tifa minigame about button pushing, i hope we get to see that again soon
[2:03:07] <%Aracon_> you must look at her armpits
[2:03:08] <+PlagueOfGripes> yeah this sequence isn't great. more so you can stare at her half naked body and jerk it all over your CRT
[2:03:08] <%CelioHogane> LEARN TO FLY
[2:03:08] <%Chichen> no this part kinda sucks

[2:04:52] <@SoFarFetched> Her plot armor suddenly became heavy.
[2:04:54] <%Meow0369> ludonarrative dissonance
[2:04:54] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt Combo airtime is different
[2:04:58] <%Dementedpenguin> Tifa literally kicked steel beams away from Wedge
[2:04:59] <+PlagueOfGripes> can't jump over a chain link fence or push it down either
[2:04:59] <%GohanHitsugaya> Ludonarrative dissonance

[2:05:13] <%sporeian94> Tifa does 40 pulluips while I can't do a single one and never have done even 1 in my entire life
[2:05:13] <%rufus2k2> a standing jump is not the same as jumping from an unsteady platform, mr Basketball Star
[2:05:13] <%valriot> Are big anime jumps an ATB skills though?
[2:05:15] <%starotter70> As Paige says, "That's Differentah"

[2:05:24] <%amused_platypus> @SoFarFetched as heavy as those milkers
[2:05:26] <%Laecerelius> Tifa's gonna kill it on Ultimate Ninja Warrior!

[2:34:39] <%Caped_Eggy> Yea but there aren't doing jack shit
[2:34:39] <%amiroodude> dinosaurs is not mako
[2:34:40] <%cherrycottontail> oil = fossilized life
[2:34:41] <%nmaten> oil is like 99% plants
[2:34:42] <%Mornaka> Barret came from a coal mine
[2:34:42] <%CelioHogane> THE PLANET IS ALIVE THO
[2:34:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> OIL IS JUST CEHMICALS
[2:34:44] <%lord_traxis> Japan doesn't have the green beliefs of the West
[2:34:44] <%flamingmonkies2> oil is things that once lived and returned to the planet
[2:34:45] <%rolfalex> oil is body mako is spirit
[2:34:46] <%arcielardor> @patstaresat She peed in your coffee
[2:34:48] <%Dragovus> Bodies are not equal to Souls
[2:34:49] <%Meow0369> Yeah but harvesting the dead bodies is different to the LIVING SOULS
[2:34:49] <%siamzero94> IT'S MOSTLY PLANTS THOUGH
[2:34:49] <%BoomerUnchained> But Pat, they're angels now
[2:34:50] <%GarbageQueenEllie> But oil isn't the thing that makes the plants grow
[2:34:51] <%Famonk> oil is not lifeforce, it's dead organic material, aka all of the stuff that ISNT the lifestream
[2:34:51] <%unstablebeast19> dinosaurs arent planet juice
[2:34:52] <%shadowace2400> yeah, but the spirits and ghosts give MORE li9fe
[2:34:52] <%spiritofmojave> Dinosaurs are life too tho, once LUL
[2:34:52] <%sporeian94> Yeah but Dinosaurs were not self aware creatures. They were giant chickens who died cause it got too cold after a meteor hit
[2:34:52] <%indig0bird> That's just shitty writing but Barrett becoing an oil Barrett is functionally just as bad
[2:34:52] <%Daskolin> SO are humans.
[2:34:54] <%alcors_wisdom> id chuck a baby in an incenerator for wifi
[2:34:54] <%Laecerelius> BUT HOW DO THEY HAVE DINO CORPSES TO TURN INTO OIL IF ALL LIFE DISITEGRATES BACK INTO THE LIFESTREAM ON DEATH?!
[2:34:55] <%Frost_Quill> Yeah but burning dino corpses is bad because we're gonna RUN OUT, not because it's literally using our ancestors spirits to heat up a bowl of soup.
[2:34:58] <%trustycoyote> So Paige, are angels made of mako? @PatStaresAt
[2:34:59] <%boogaleeboo> Oil is just chemicals that kill all life when you burn enough of it!
[2:34:59] <%ringabal> Pat ACTIVELY advocating for mortally challenged rights
[2:35:00] <%DonatelloJose> carbon is not the collective consciousness
[2:35:00] <%collind99> Also us burning the oil is killing the planet
[2:35:00] <%mechslayer71> The planet isn’t gonna die when we run out of oil @patstaresat
[2:35:01] <%GohanHitsugaya> But unlike oil, the lifestream keeps the planet alive!
[2:35:01] <%heartlesshealer> GHOST of dinosaur
[2:35:01] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Oil is actually mostly plankton and krill
[2:35:06] <%Nobrev> OIL ISN'T DINOSAUR SOULS

[2:58:59] <%ImmaCanuck> *muffled A HA HA HA HA in the distance*
[2:59:02] <%worldbrand> So that means tidus canonically steps on a landmine, because that guy wrote for this game

[2:59:12] <%lionandfox21> @GarbageQueenEllie Curry is good and you can start with Japanese curry for something not as strong
[2:59:13] <%PadreHail> LUCRECIIAAAAAAAAAAA
[2:59:18] <%Shockrates20XX> Probably that one with the hat because she has a unique model
[2:59:19] <%Famonk> the one in the middle with her legs to the side
[2:59:21] <%Garthunox> LUCRECIA!
[2:59:23] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt Does that mean Vincent and Gast are there?

[3:05:31] <%Mornaka> The only one who cared about his VO
[3:05:31] <%Meow0369> Without reeve there'd be no fucking midgar

[3:05:39] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Watch my roads, Daddy Reeve
[3:05:40] <%Frost_Quill> Reeve probably loves his job, he hates his BOSSES.
[3:05:42] <%Zombrocom> You have all these cartoonishly evil assholes, and then there is reeve just doing his job LUL
[3:05:42] <%SH1NK1R0> Actually he’s the only one proud of his job and trying to do his best @patstaresat

[3:05:48] <%ringabal> Shinra's CG team killing it
[3:05:51] <%tigerfang86> SO EVIL
[3:05:52] <%Mornaka> @unstablebeast19 not really
[3:05:53] <%CrookedSpiral> CrookedSpiral subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[3:05:54] <%narusao> seems legit
[3:05:56] <+Remery_> so cute
[3:05:59] <%Meow0369> Look at all this gil spent on CG
[3:06:04] <%Hoot_Patoots> "And we will never ever drop a whole city on you"
[3:06:05] <%Famonk> these screens are done really well though
[3:06:07] <%Shadicara> Spreading the clum all over shinra
[3:06:08] <%JoshyJ> shinra social team goes hard
[3:06:09] <%Laecerelius> "Reeve, join us in doing evil shit!" "Sir, I just want to build a nice city..."
[3:06:12] <%PocketChange117> I smell a mid boss. It's like, too calm n shit. Feels like a buildup
[3:06:14] <%LokimenD> Reeve is a true believer
[3:06:20] <%sporeian94> Anyone else buy The Shinra Museum Season Pass? Pays for itself after the 16th visit!
[3:06:21] <%Meow0369> Lmao
[3:06:22] <%코코꾸라> LUL
[3:06:24] <%luftraumm1> that looks a lot like an actual advertisement
[3:06:24] <%prism_zet> yeyeyeye
[3:06:25] <%starotter70> RIGHT!?
[3:06:26] <%j0ustar> dammit
[3:06:27] <@Mechz71> the plate drop was for citizen safety
[3:06:30] <%DakotaMacDoodle> @CelioHogane Right
[3:06:30] <%Nupinoop296> wait what does
[3:06:39] <%Mornaka> @unstablebeast19 he kindof just obsesses with outdoing his dad
[3:06:40] <%Sir_stride> @nupinoop296 midgar
[3:06:40] <%Hoot_Patoots> See now the citizen are safely secured under the plate
[3:06:42] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt So apparently Shinra in X-2 was originally just a reference to FF7 after the team discovered they accidentally made X-2's world look like FF7's. They then joked that X-2 is a super prequel to FF7 and that took off into a weird "maybe/maybe not" canon
[3:06:44] <%PocketChange117> The plate drop was for logo redesign
[3:06:44] <%Nupinoop296> OH SHIT... NICE
[3:06:45] <%ringabal> Oh look, the game developer's scale model
[3:06:47] <%televisedrevolting> Reeve should just say "Fuck it." and just play City Skylines instead.
[3:06:47] <+Remery_> TEEHEE

[3:23:56] <%Shadicara> Good crit everything
[3:23:56] <%valkuma> barret crits a LOT too
[3:23:57] <%CelioHogane> I just realiced everybody has exactly 6 weapons, but there is slots for 7 weapons...
[3:23:57] <%spiritofmojave> shit how'd I miss that
[3:23:58] <%realm_forge> So it is either amazing or sucks
[3:23:59] <%j0ustar> it's a mood ring that shoots bullets
[3:23:59] <%baronblank> wow that is a good point, he just charged 5x the bombing mission cost for cloud for a tip
[3:24:02] <%Typhaeon> 3 slots jesus
[3:24:02] <%Fenrirlives> @patstaresat what if Barret surgically restructured his arm to be compatible with military grade weapons!
[3:24:03] <%CelioHogane> @Balsty yes he did
[3:24:04] <+Remery_> Crit Gunner
[3:24:04] <%goose_attack_almanac> How likely is it that Barret has that cloth slip on his arm so that his Gun Arm Prosthetic doesn't freak Marlene out
[3:24:05] <%starotter70> 4 materia upgrades
[3:24:05] <%heartlesshealer> Wait, four materia slot upgrades???
[3:24:05] <%Typhaeon> 4
[3:24:06] <%Felto3> Magic gun really
[3:24:07] <%SolidusRex> He knew you guys were coming
[3:24:09] <%ShawnTK_> @Balsty Melee weapons are trash on Barret
[3:24:09] <%Aracon_> I don't like using it much, but the skill for it is nice
[3:24:09] <%Verd_254> @Dakuu75 he went back and got in for hard mode
[3:24:11] <%ScreamLord> With LOOOOOOTS of slots
[3:24:12] <%KawaiiJetty> Crazy man with magnum gun arm
[3:24:23] <%Zombrocom> That is a lot of slots
[3:24:23] <%Dakuu75> @Verd_254 gotchya
[3:24:24] <%NeekOleek> missed this on my playthrough and had to go back for it after. point blank is dope though
[3:24:27] <%amused_platypus> look at all those materia slots
[3:24:32] <%boogaleeboo> Big magic big materia
[3:24:34] <%mechslayer71> @goose_attack_almanac Somewhat likely
[3:24:39] <%Dragon_Batman> I didn't pay him eithe4r
[3:24:42] <%TenderBabyBacon> It's his Million Materia Gun
[3:24:45] <%Solid_Stro> Soothing music
[3:24:45] <%Dragon_Batman> Had to go back
[3:24:47] <%Balsty> @ShawnTK_ eh depends, the super armor on his combo is really nice
[3:24:49] <%delilah4you> Holy shit I got here with 15k gil and assumed he was bullshitting me and totally missed that! I'm SO MAD!
[3:24:50] <%코코꾸라> Big Bertha
[3:24:53] <%Verd_254> but the weapon skill tho
[3:24:53] <%lionandfox21> i went with Big Bertha
[3:24:54] <%cvp5127> the skill tho
[3:24:55] <%heartlesshealer> Just get the weapon skill
[3:24:56] <%ringabal> psaBig
[3:24:56] <%Dwarven_Gaming> get the ability tho
[3:24:57] <%ScreamLord> BB
[3:25:02] <%mankeyfigh> big bertha da best
[3:25:05] <%collind99> get the skill
[3:25:08] <%Meow0369> Pat just auto upgrade in attack -_-
[3:25:12] <%majindusto> COWARD
[3:25:15] <%CelioHogane> @Kenori why would you ever not pay him anyway?
[3:25:15] <%Aracon_> psaBig bertha is just his best weapon
[3:25:15] <%heartlesshealer> Get HP upgrades then
[3:25:25] <%Nobrev> I just upgrade all the weapons all the way anyway because it bugs the hell out of me to see unspent points @PatStaresAt
[3:25:31] <+Remery_> Barret actually has really cool abilities, tons of Aoe ones
[3:25:32] <%heartlesshealer> 6 SLOTS
[3:25:32] <%delilah4you> Because I didnt have that much money
[3:25:41] <%mrpheonix1212> it bugs that there are 7 weapon slots
[3:25:52] <%Shadicara> Yo look at those pink power ranger gloves LUL
[3:25:54] <%KawaiiJetty> Barret utility monster
[3:25:55] <%CelioHogane> @mrpheonix1212 I JUST SAID THAT, IT'S SO WIERD
[3:25:59] <%Garthunox> @kenori you had enough tho
[3:26:03] <%CelioHogane> @mrpheonix1212 DLC weapons, maybe?
[3:26:07] <%cherrycottontail> Berret needs to use the Ecoterrorist materia
[3:26:08] <%ShawnTK_> @mrpheonix1212 Well you see, in the Final Mix DLC
[3:26:15] <%Aracon_> warding materia not linked to anything lol
[3:26:16] <%Nobrev> you need to link warding
[3:26:17] <%lionandfox21> might as well get the materia skills up
[3:26:18] <%heartlesshealer> Pat, you can link those last two slots
[3:26:18] <%Scarnehu> hp
[3:26:21] <%spiritofmojave> do you have revive equipped? should level that on someone for hard mode assuming you play it.
[3:26:22] <%starotter70> It's not connected
[3:26:28] <%Nupinoop296> i keep forgetting that Barrett isn't the leader of AVALANCHE
[3:26:29] <%Garthunox> wait how did pat get a second elemental?
[3:26:31] <%starotter70> Ah
[3:26:31] <%Meow0369> Remember in the original where barret is the one who creates avalanche?
[3:26:33] <%Dragon_Batman> That is fine
[3:26:34] <%Aracon_> that's fine
[3:26:36] <%lionandfox21> that's what i did
[3:26:36] <%heartlesshealer> Then why level Warding over other materia?
[3:26:46] <%The_Cassowary> he just going for weapon ability then taking the gun off
[3:26:47] <%mrpheonix1212> only dlc chapter i could think of is what barret does after the second reactor since we dont really know what happens there
[3:26:49] <%HIPSTERCORGl> @Garthunox sidequest final angel of the slums
[3:26:49] <%lotharrio> I wonder if the Mayor would have helped if he knew this was the Avalanche Cell that always fucks up and kills everyone?
[3:26:50] <%prism_zet> link it to ap up, level faster
[3:26:55] <%lord_traxis> Give first strike
[3:27:01] <%Aracon_> there ya go
[3:27:01] <%heartlesshealer> perfect
[3:27:03] <%SH1NK1R0> @garthunox there are two in the game. The last one is tied to side quest completion
[3:27:06] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt there's something up with the librarian bots around here, but i never figured it out
[3:27:09] <%flamingmonkies2> more tank more better
[3:27:11] <%spiritofmojave> Good choice
[3:27:14] <%Solid_Stro> Why you gotta be a Link Whore? DansGame
[3:27:14] <%LaughingCatt> as you should
[3:27:16] <%boogaleeboo> Revive is profoundly the right choice
[3:27:21] <%spiritofmojave> Arise is pretty solid
[3:27:22] <%heartlesshealer> Robot <3
[3:27:23] <%starotter70> Revival takes a fucking while
[3:27:29] <@SoFarFetched> R2T2
[3:27:32] <%siamzero94> RT-T2
[3:27:32] <%Meow0369> Eat shit shinra

[3:27:58] <%patriotrenegade> i never figured it out @PatStaresAt
[3:27:59] <%boki_86> @PatStaresAt so the robots are rferencing the passwords from the original game
[3:27:59] <%QuadraticGravity> I think it's a reference to the old minigame
[3:28:02] <%Hoot_Patoots> your head asplode
[3:28:03] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt reference to puzzle in original
[3:28:04] <%spiritofmojave> but they don't serve a purpose now
[3:28:04] <%Verd_254> for you to run around confused
[3:28:05] <%Solid_Stro> Weird...
[3:28:07] <%Meow0369> Maybe it's a reference to the originals puzzle of the books being in the wrong place
[3:28:11] <%rolfalex> old passwords
[3:28:14] <%Buzzard42> it's a throwback to the old game
[3:28:20] <%Hoot_Patoots> oooooh right the old minigame

[3:30:36] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I bet they change that slightly.
[3:30:36] <%bread_assassin> I REALLY hope that makes it back into the remake part 2.
[3:30:39] <%MasterTonberry23> I'm gonna assume Hojo's rich
[3:30:41] <@mothmandraws> I like aerith letting go of her breath after the scene
[3:30:41] <%kingbaconcrispy> @lionandfox21 Yes.
[3:30:46] <@mothmandraws> nice touch
[3:30:47] <+Remery_> I bet Shinra has a Mcdonalds in there
[3:30:48] <%MisterRockett> Like, no expansion that makes it reasonable.
[3:30:49] <%lionandfox21> Barret is a real all or nothing kind of guy huh
[3:30:50] <%luftraumm1> there'd better be a whole beach episode
[3:30:51] <%heartlesshealer> business suit man who's stressed
[3:30:52] <%pureotome> i literally asked myself why they didn't kill that fuck during costa de sol
[3:30:54] <+PlagueOfGripes> now. for the chairs.
[3:30:55] <%Tenkay> Hope part 2 has Hojo in a speedo in the beach
[3:30:56] <%Pyroclase> I don't like how the Sector 7 collapse is treated as like, extra work hours

[3:31:07] <%FoolsArcade> Cloud looks like a soldier though
[3:31:08] <%Meow0369> Well cloud looks like a soldier
[3:31:08] <%suikudo> SLUT IN TOW
[3:31:08] <%JoshyJ> at least cloud looks like SOLDIER
[3:31:09] <%spiritofmojave> because he's black huh
[3:31:10] <%The_Cassowary> Tifa has the worlds largest titos
[3:31:11] <%starotter70> What do you mean?
[3:31:11] <%Daskolin> Cloud Look like SOLDIER tho
[3:31:11] <%amiroodude> Tifa is just being hot
[3:31:12] <%Mornaka> At least Cloud has the uniform
[3:31:13] <%patriotrenegade> Or Tifa with her guns and badokadonks and mini skirt
[3:31:13] <%siamzero94> Cloud could go as a soldier so no
[3:31:13] <%SH1NK1R0> Cloud looks like any other soldier to them
[3:31:14] <%BoomerUnchained> Well, he's just soldier man
[3:31:14] <%Kingjhon8> what about tifa though
[3:31:15] <%Garthunox> he looks like a soldier
[3:31:15] <%JohnAtDawn> ...LOUD SILENCE
[3:31:15] <%marsantas> Cloud at least looks like a soldier, they'd be used to that
[3:31:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Barret is SO conspicus that people don't question him
[3:31:17] <%Frost_Quill> Cloud LOOKS like a Shinra soldier.
[3:31:18] <%Famonk> 'they're with me'
[3:31:18] <%ALazo> And Tifa is a bombshell so everyone is looking at her anyway
[3:31:19] <%j0ustar> was about to say
[3:31:21] <%rufus2k2> WHERE IS YOUR HELMET SOLDIER
[3:31:23] <%Pyroclase> Flatscreen monitors...?
[3:31:26] <%suikudo> Tifa stands out like a sore thumb!
[3:31:27] <%Daskolin> OFFICE SLAVES!!!
[3:31:27] <%LaughingCatt> Your just security, those guys dress weird
[3:31:28] <%Frost_Quill> Tifa looks like she just got back from the gym.
[3:31:29] <%rufus2k2> THAT HELMET WASN'T YOURS TO LOSE
[3:31:30] <%MasterTonberry23> Now I dunno why no ones asking Barret anything but I guess they dont want to talk to a black guy
[3:31:32] <%Xenokhrist> i'm sad we don't get the Crisis Core Shinra building theme anywhere
[3:31:32] <%Famonk> YES CRUNCH TIME
[3:31:38] <%GohanHitsugaya> LUL It's because he's black isn't it?!
[3:31:39] <+Remery_> CRUNCH THEM
[3:31:41] <%ape_hawk> "hundreds of people died in the slums, but at least these office drones have to work overtime" -tifa
[3:31:41] <%KawaiiJetty> Mmh crunch
[3:31:41] <%코코꾸라> Crunch vs no crunch
[3:31:42] <%weissguard> Cloud also makes more sense because Zack and Angeal wore that exact sword in this building before.
[3:31:42] <%sporeian94> Listen if I'm at work an some people walk through with a giant sword and gun arm I am just keeping my head down

[3:31:54] <%rufus2k2> Ah yes, Pat has the big boy gun now, nice
[3:31:54] <%TenderBabyBacon> Tifa drags all the sight cones towards her with her orbs of gravity
[3:31:55] <%heartlesshealer> Man, I hope we get to see Red trying to walk around in a uniform
[3:31:56] <%suikudo> If one of these suits walked by tifa they would say "She blowing the president or some shit?!"

[3:39:41] <%ringabal> @PlagueOfGripes Technology tends to drip down like a pyramid scheme
[3:39:45] <%KawaiiJetty> Music banger returns
[3:39:59] <%Aracon_> gotta love that
[3:40:01] <%goose_attack_almanac> @doc_ock_rokc in my defense, that girl who also approached me had giant tiffos and I had to take a shot
[3:40:03] <%Bluwizard21> @goose_attack_almanac to be fair he talked to everyone else on that floor as well. also, if a guy with a gun for an arm ask you a question wouldn't you answer?
[3:40:06] <%Jasonipock> psaDab you can do it
[3:40:07] <%heartlesshealer> NO
[3:40:09] <%PadreHail> Trickle down makonomics
[3:40:13] <+Remery_> Imagine the amount of VR sim porn Shinra has
[3:40:14] <%Aracon_> GOTTA LOVE THAT
[3:40:15] <+PlagueOfGripes> haha interrupts go brrrrt
[3:40:18] <%goose_attack_almanac> Fair enough @Bluwizard21
[3:40:21] <%valriot> Now i know why Paty doesnt play Black Mage in FFXIV
[3:40:23] <%MonsterEnvy> Use weaker version
[3:40:25] <%Solid_Stro> The Trumpet in this song fucks Kreygasm
[3:40:26] <%mankeyfigh> twice
[3:40:28] <%heartlesshealer> you can see the enemy do a skill name
[3:40:30] <%Frost_Quill> @PlagueOfGripes They had holodeck simulations in X as well.
[3:40:37] <%Famonk> @Ynkubus18 but we caught it on camera
[3:40:38] <%Balsty> pat its a lot easier to cast big spells if you have barret take aggro
[3:40:43] <%luftraumm1> cast magic and then change over to another character to draw attention
[3:40:49] <%mankeyfigh> there goes all Cloud's MP
[3:40:49] <%heartlesshealer> nice
[3:40:51] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> I really wanna watch Robot Wars now
[3:40:51] <+Remery_> Crit my asshole
[3:40:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> SHOW HIM YOUR CRITS
[3:40:59] <+PlagueOfGripes> Crit Tits smacks again
[3:41:02] <%flamingmonkies2> master Barret's new weapon ability
[3:41:11] <%Hoot_Patoots> "WILL YOU GIVE ME A SHOWER ?" -Tifa
[3:41:11] <%spiritofmojave> Critty tiddy
[3:41:12] <%Aracon_> I noticed pat never really uses L2/R2 to control the other party members
[3:41:13] <%WhereIsWill> did pat get the purple pain or whatever?
[3:41:14] <%heartlesshealer> nice dodge for barret
[3:41:19] <%Ynkubus18> @Famonk it wasn't me
[3:41:25] <%luftraumm1> shower her in man batter
[3:41:28] <+PlagueOfGripes> quickly! the human switched players! attack whoever he's controlling to ensure he can't have fun!
[3:41:44] <%코코꾸라> imagine missing the point that hard
[3:41:46] <%Caped_Eggy> Delay explosion
[3:41:59] <%hzealot> @plagueofgripes For real its so stupid
[3:42:08] <%PocketChange117> Plague im sensing you have some criticisms of the game lmao
[3:42:10] <%Xenokhrist> there's a superboss at the end of the combat sim
[3:42:12] <%GarbageQueenEllie> SSSStylish
[3:42:12] <%ringabal> Character Switch like its Wave Dashing
[3:42:14] <+PlagueOfGripes> it's to try to encourage switching, but some enemies have it overly aggressive
[3:42:15] <%WhereIsWill> why ya gotta be this way plague doodLUL doodLUL
[3:42:15] <%mrpheonix1212> dodge cancel and one button being one atk would be nice in this combat to make it more possible to dodge
[3:42:19] <%heartlesshealer> 👏
[3:42:26] <%Tallie> you can keep doing it so it gets higher ive reached 500% before on a stagger
[3:42:26] <%MonsterEnvy> Plauge is a grump who was complaining the whole time
[3:42:27] <%hzealot> chat the game has problems
[3:42:29] <%ape_hawk> congrats, you didnt suck as much!
[3:42:33] <%MonsterEnvy> He hated the Reno and Rude fight
[3:42:34] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea some enemies do not stop going in sometimes
[3:42:37] <%hzealot> blizzard is bad, aero not much better
[3:42:40] <%luftraumm1> @PlagueOfGripes i wanna see how the game balances itself on hard
[3:42:43] <%spiritofmojave> @plagueofgripes they completely removed the "front, back, center" positional stuff for a stupid AI, if there's one gameplay thing that's dumb
[3:42:45] <%Meow0369> Oh boy is this the part where chat goes full subreddit mode and starts crying
[3:42:45] <%Robot_Nixon_> Dual Max Luck materia is the best PogChamp
[3:42:46] <%VHGS> If they didn't you would have to micromanage your guys to make them not die from stuff, which would be much much worse.
[3:42:48] <%Aracon_> this guy has a nice vest
[3:42:48] <%boogaleeboo> And now....an old friend
[3:42:49] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Guys its not like his name is literally PLAGUE OF GRIPES
[3:42:50] <%DXLelouch24> Plague is sitting here complaining that the enemy ai is too agressive, just switch faster as Abzu hard mlde forces you to gitgud at
[3:42:52] <%lotharrio> Hey but Pat... you think maybe there's more VR battles?
[3:42:54] <%Hoot_Patoots> THERE HE IS
[3:42:56] <%Balsty> I mean yeah the AI is bullshit but the mechanic to encourage switching is nowhere near the problem with the AI
[3:42:57] <%hzealot> you can't hit bosses past thresholds so the game eats your LBs
[3:42:59] <%starotter70> Hey Chadley

[3:44:12] <%Aracon_> he's an intern it's a part of the dress code
[3:44:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> HE IS THE HACKER
[3:44:13] <%Mr_Pylon> I hope Chadley turns out to be a Hojo monstrosity
[3:44:13] <%Zebroneath> what a chad
[3:44:14] <%BoomerUnchained> NotLikeThis

[3:44:16] <%narusao> so very human
[3:44:18] <%CelioHogane> @Pyroclase he is clearly albino

[3:44:22] <%toastybites> surge in trust????
[3:44:23] <%Dragon_Batman> It's funny he is a weirdo cuz he is this young prodigy
[3:44:23] <%Robot_Nixon_> I'll bet money Chadley will be in North Crater during the final bit
[3:44:23] <+PlagueOfGripes> is he actually 45 years old or something
[3:44:24] <%pynkdoe> are you even old enough to work here???
[3:44:24] <%nmaten> Anime??? in MY anime game???
[3:44:27] <%mankeyfigh> He's flying under the radar babyee
[3:44:29] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt If you beat every VR mission in the game, you get a secret scene with him
[3:44:31] <%WhereIsWill> nomuraaaa
[3:44:31] <+Remery_> Hey man Scientists don't have the bst social skills
[3:44:33] <%marchums> Pat did you max out your magic materia?
[3:44:37] <%Pyroclase> @CelioHogane Are his eyes red?
[3:44:37] <%Daniel_Is_I> This motherfucker can make summon materia and he's an intern, but Shinra's top men can't
[3:44:43] <%Hoot_Patoots> oh there's a little interaction coming up if he takes the stairs down i really like
[3:44:44] <%KawaiiJetty> He's 200 years old
[3:44:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Oh shit does the bathroom still have the softlock glitch?
[3:44:48] <%weissguard> Fantasy world twinks are exceptions to actual rules. @PlagueOfGripes Kappa
[3:44:52] <%CelioHogane> @Pyroclase uhhhh i don't know actually
[3:44:52] <%mighty_max_t> I feel like Chadley is actually a robot or series of robots
[3:44:53] <%Aracon_> too bad you won't get the answer to that question till you complete all the battle intel
[3:44:53] <%spiritofmojave> he's like a lalafel, he doesn't and is puntable sized
[3:44:55] <%Charonofthememe> Is Chadley a shitkid? Or is he just bizarre?
[3:44:57] <%heartlesshealer> remember to save for chadley
[3:44:59] <%spiritofmojave> *age
[3:45:01] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Chadley grows up into Yazoo
[3:45:01] <%rufus2k2> just weird
[3:45:03] <%NeonNobleKalzeria> I never saw a patch so I think the softlock is still in the bathroom
[3:45:05] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> she was selling shinpads and coffee
[3:45:06] <%siamzero94> HE'S AN ANDROID!
[3:45:08] <%arancet> @valriot unless the scene is beating him to a pulp i dont want it
[3:45:08] <%Meow0369> NOOOOOOOOOO
[3:45:09] <%collind99> midgar probably doesn't have good child/worker protections
[3:45:12] <%CrypticMochi> Chadley might be robot

People in my state have been protesting the quarantine with guns, confederate flags and Nazi flags all week. Coming here is how I stay sane. Which, considering you and chat, is like saying Snickers keep me thin. Still, thanks for being you, OJ Man.
[3:45:13] <%rufus2k2> DEAL WITH IIIIIT~

[3:45:21] <%DXLelouch24> @daniel_is_i their too busy having a boner over starting another war with Wutai
[3:45:22] <%PadreHail> Some people don't have the bathroom softlock but it was fucking killing my run so I had to skip the extra peep scenes
[3:45:22] <%CelioHogane> @Pyroclase no they are blue, but that's still albino enough
[3:45:25] <%rufus2k2> CHRIS AT 24 CAN FLY A GODDAMN HARRIER
[3:45:31] <+PlagueOfGripes> Ragbag sounds nasty
[3:45:31] <%Pyroclase> can we talk about Shinra has literal holodeck technology
[3:45:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Daniel_Is_I Sometimes experts are blinded by limitations while beginners do it without knowing it was a limit
[3:45:33] <%RetroCop87> you can also do these post game
[3:45:36] <%weissguard> @joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo Sorry you have to deal with that. Stay strong.

[3:46:16] <%GohanHitsugaya> Maybe
[3:46:16] <%Dakuu75> yes
[3:46:16] <%heartlesshealer> depends on you
[3:46:16] <%pureotome> maybe
[3:46:16] <%DeoxysPrime> It would be about 4-5 hours
[3:46:16] <%Mornaka> probably?
[3:46:16] <%NovaKnightmare> Maybe
[3:46:16] <%lionandfox21> Depends how you do
[3:46:17] <%beepbeepbopbop> Barely
[3:46:17] <+Remery_> Maybe
[3:46:17] <%spiritofmojave> Depends how long you want
[3:46:17] <%DonatelloJose> not at this pace
[3:46:17] <%JoshyJ> maybe?
[3:46:17] <+PlagueOfGripes> doubtful
[3:46:17] <%toastybites> Probably
[3:46:17] <%prism_zet> depends on how precious you are
[3:46:18] <%Afterman_> YES

[3:46:20] <%Solid_Stro> Perhaps
[3:46:20] <%beepbeepbopbop> Probably not
[3:46:20] <%Pyroclase> it depends on how much you linger
[3:46:20] <%amiroodude> no
[3:46:20] <%mankeyfigh> MAYBE
[3:46:20] <%Wurmspawn> Not sure to be honest.
[3:46:21] <%starotter70> Long stream, but maybe
[3:46:21] <%Meow0369> IT really does depend
[3:46:21] <%weissguard> I mean, wasn't that in the schedule? So it makes sense to do this now.
[3:46:21] <%Visorak6> BIG MAYBE
[3:46:21] <%Maids4lyfe> no

[3:46:24] <%RetroCop87> people saying know are pissy
[3:46:24] <%Mr_Pylon> It'll be a longass stream
[3:46:24] <%spiritofmojave> It'd be another 5-6 hours
[3:46:24] <%NeonNobleKalzeria> no, the section coming up is pretty long
[3:46:25] <%Quigsies> BIG MAYBE
[3:46:25] <%Afterman_> you have like 5 hours left
[3:46:26] <%lionandfox21> You can always go back
[3:46:27] <%Zebroneath> a lot of maybes
[3:46:28] <%StaceMcGate> Chapter 17 is LONG
[3:46:28] <%Garthunox> no
[3:46:29] <%Shockrates20XX> You've probably got a good 6 hours
[3:46:29] <%logoth_> 2.1k!
[3:46:30] <$LEMON_LIME_> LEMON_LIME_ subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:46:30] <%Odyr2001> YES BUT LONG STREAM
[3:46:30] <%delilah4you> Probably not
[3:46:32] <%delilah4you> Its pretty long
[3:46:33] <%SolidusRex> YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME NOW
[3:46:33] <%Zombrocom> Not at all
[3:46:33] <%Garthunox> hell no
[3:46:35] <%Tearonex> No
[3:46:37] <%delilah4you> It woul dhave to be LONG
[3:46:37] <%JoshyJ> yeah you can do them postgame
[3:46:38] <%Halowood> maybe, ending is pretty long
[3:46:38] <%lionandfox21> piss stream
[3:46:39] <%hzealot> chat if you're upset people like me and plague complain, maybe the fame should have better combat system
[3:46:42] <%spiritofmojave> LONG STREAM?
[3:46:44] <%j0ustar> stream is saved!!
[3:46:44] <%Animorphimagi> 8 hours from here
[3:46:45] <+Remery_> empty the tank coach
[3:46:46] <%mrpheonix1212> maybe
[3:46:47] <%beepbeepbopbop> Is Pat aware of that vent bug?
[3:46:49] <%SilverDevilfish> oh did anyone warn Pat about the vents?
[3:46:50] <%johnchikr> L O N G
[3:46:50] <%Wurmspawn> The last chapters are much longer than you'd expect.
[3:46:51] <%Aracon_> for those who don't know, the next bit of the game takes a long ass time
[3:46:53] <%majindusto> Nooooooooo, Do it Now
[3:46:54] <%nmaten> just do it all right now
[3:46:55] <%Solid_Stro> Start of Chapter 17 is perfect
[3:46:58] <%Meow0369> @hzealot Wow how arrogant can you possibly be?
[3:46:58] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> nooooooooo
[3:47:01] <%MonsterEnvy> @hzealot Maybe you are just bad
[3:47:01] <%RetroCop87> people in chat are slow, there's 5 hours left
[3:47:05] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> sadness...
[3:47:06] <%boogaleeboo> It's like another 5 fucking hours, no way he's doing it now
[3:47:09] <%Aracon_> so long if he did the missions now it would take like 2 extra streams
[3:47:12] <%DXLelouch24> He can do it with chapter select, theres no rush
[3:47:12] <%mankeyfigh> what's with the vents, I had no issues
[3:47:12] <%hzealot> @beepbeepbopbop I was not and hadn't saved ao I lost all my combat sim progress
[3:47:12] <%WhereIsWill> wha? I love plagues gripes dafuq u mean??
[3:47:15] <%pureotome> the start of ch 17 is a good place to stop for tomorrow
[3:47:21] <%axiomthunder> what happened? break or donw streaming?
[3:47:25] <%boogaleeboo> piss
[3:47:25] <%DonatelloJose> @RetroCop87 You're nuts dude.
[3:47:26] <%MonsterEnvy> break
[3:47:26] <%mrpheonix1212> hes about to get to where i soft locked the game
[3:47:26] <%PadreHail> Max stopped around 17 too
[3:47:27] <%Animorphimagi> it's totally 8 hours left
[3:47:29] <%StaceMcGate> Chapter 17 will take a full day by itself
[3:47:34] <%boogaleeboo> It's not that bad
[3:47:39] <%Wurmspawn> @axiomthunder try refreshing.
[3:47:42] <%ringabal> It's pretty bad
[3:47:44] <%valriot> 17-18 is a whole stream, and ending earlier is too long for next stream
[3:47:46] <%boogaleeboo> Oh it sucks shit
[3:47:47] <%majindusto> You can't return here if you go to Chapter 17
[3:47:49] <%DXLelouch24> You people are slow as fuck if it took you a day to do 17
[3:47:49] <%boogaleeboo> But it's not an entire stream bad
[3:47:52] <%Dragon_Batman> It would also depend on how long he fafs about
[3:48:00] <%pureotome> ch 17 was annoying to me
[3:48:09] <%mankeyfigh> 17 isn't that long, but it was longer than I was expecting
[3:48:10] <%DonatelloJose> I'm sorry is this the salt mines?
[3:48:12] <%Dragon_Batman> I loved chp 17
[3:48:18] <%PadreHail> Chapter 15-18 took me like 6 hours total
[3:48:23] <%fragdar> he wont end the game today right?
[3:48:24] <%Hoot_Patoots> liked the concept but went on a bit long
[3:48:28] <%ringabal> Wait, nevermind. Midnight stream it is
[3:48:31] <%Animorphimagi> chapter 18 is an abomination
[3:48:33] <%Daskolin> Guys game literally ha CH SELECT CHILL!
[3:48:35] <%siamzero94> @fragdar no way
[3:48:35] <%Aracon_> bare in mind pat would probably get distracted by paige and elmo at multiple points in the stream LUL
[3:48:35] <%Dragon_Batman> I can see the complaints
[3:48:36] <%tigerfang86> definitely not ending tonight
[3:48:37] <@mothmandraws> ez just skip cut scenes
[3:48:41] <%hzealot> @meow0369 @monsterenvy I see. its clearly players fault if they stagger a boss, pop LB and 2 hits in game forces you into a scene and eats your limit gauge. not shit design
[3:48:45] <%KaiserMario> Has Paige ever been introduced to "Skeleton Warrior couldn't protect the Dungeon"?
[3:48:47] <%boogaleeboo> He's not doing a 10 hour stream
[3:48:51] <%fragdar> ok, then i gonna go sleep.. see yall
[3:48:56] <%mankeyfigh> You spend like less than half an hour in Hojo's lab in the original, but in this... well...
[3:48:59] <%Meow0369> @hzealot Stop being a dick because you're not great at the game
[3:49:07] <%Dragon_Batman> I mean he can get back to it in chp 17 cuz it's in the lab
[3:49:10] <%Nobody404> @hzealot You can express opinions without being an ass about it lol
[3:49:11] <%hzealot> again how is that me being bad
[3:49:20] <%DonatelloJose> SKELETON WARRIORS
[3:49:21] <%valriot> Like Pats already spent an hour talking to Paige, best thing to do is get to the point where he can just blast through the final 2 chapters tomorrow
[3:49:22] <%starotter70> Took me like 7 hours to get from this point to the end, so eh
[3:49:28] <%majindusto> Do the Combats NOW...You cannot return here if you go to Chapter 17
[3:49:30] <%optimasmaximas> @ringabal wait why midnight stream?
[3:49:32] <%RetroCop87> @hzealot maybe reel back those feels for a sec, you're clearly being pissy

[3:55:52] <%NeonNobleKalzeria> When you interact with an optional thing in the vents, it softlocks and you can't progress
[3:55:53] <%Shockrates20XX> I got the bug but I haven't seen a single streamer get it. If it weren't for others talking about it I'd think it was a fever dream.

[4:08:48] <%rufus2k2> @Dakuu75 he's Riderman
[4:08:50] <%TenderBabyBacon> Just drug her up a little bit and then throw her into the SEXY GACKT PIT
[4:08:51] <%YakumoYomi> Is Hojo his real name, or his H-doujin artist name?
[4:08:52] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> and he ruined Final Fantasy 7
[4:08:52] <%lotharrio> He's a singer with strange power over all media in Japan.
[4:08:53] <%boogaleeboo> He did voice over work in Crisis Core
[4:08:53] <%Sir_stride> but how does he relate to FF7?
[4:08:54] <%Xenokhrist> You mean BUJINGAI?!
[4:08:54] <%Guardiansaiyan> @lockhead45 he said tomorrow finish
[4:08:55] <%KasiCrafter> Suspicious amount of poson materials...
[4:08:56] <%controlzer0> create the perfect race
[4:09:00] <%Zombrocom> I love how that explains nothing
[4:09:00] <%Dragon_Batman> In the 2000's he was so famous he was in a bunch of games
[4:09:00] <%Afterman_> @YakumoYomi yes
[4:09:01] <%VantomPayne> BUJINGAI
[4:09:01] <%Zebroneath> "Who is Gakt?" is a loaded question
[4:09:01] <%Treuan> You forgot the CBT tag
[4:09:02] <%DukeBlack_> He's practically Japanese Michael Jackson
[4:09:02] <%saynof> @Dakuu75 Prince and Bowie's lovechild, but Japanese
[4:09:02] <%CursedNobleman> @BallerSwagBro9k NWF
[4:09:04] <%heartlesshealer> People don't know about CRISIS CORE
[4:09:04] <%Daskolin> Gackt = GENESIS RHAPSODY
[4:09:05] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> he was in Crisis Core
[4:09:06] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[4:09:07] <%cvp5127> LUL
[4:09:08] <%Meow0369> !uptime
[4:09:08] <%tinyswampthing> he saved it
[4:09:08] <%Solid_Stro> WAS a big deal I Japan
[4:09:09] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 9m.
[4:09:10] <%marsantas> A professional fun ruiner
[4:09:10] <%Aracon_> @CelioHogane we need to appeal to a broader demohraphic psaSmug
[4:09:11] <%SaiyanShoto> Who likes to force himself in everything g he liked
[4:09:12] <+PlagueOfGripes> he paid money to ruin it
[4:09:13] <%starotter70> Gackt's OC
[4:09:16] <%heartlesshealer> vending machine
[4:09:16] <%mankeyfigh> how many saves?
[4:09:19] <%j0ustar> Play Dirge of Cerberus as well. Have fun
[4:09:20] <%MonsterEnvy> He's dead now
[4:09:21] <%realm_forge> I thought you were talking about that lizard from that ps1 game
[4:09:21] <%tiaramaki> He was in Dirge's secret ending first, techinically, but yes
[4:09:23] <%Aracon_> gackt is the strongest FF character known to man
[4:09:23] <%rufus2k2> man imagine Crisis Core Remake
[4:09:23] <%LaughingCatt> hes the Great Value brand sephiroth
[4:09:24] <%majindusto> DIRGE OF CERBERUS TOO
[4:09:25] <%DedlokPM> @Dakuu75 Japanese signer who has a lot of money and has literally funded games and movies on the condition that they put HIM in it
[4:09:26] <%RetroCop87> also dirge
[4:09:26] <%NovaKnightmare> Genesis was also a massive Poochie
[4:09:27] <%collind99> is gackt bad?
[4:09:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> And?
[4:09:28] <%heartlesshealer> oh wait, you have all the music, nvm
[4:09:28] <%the38bandit> Mr clemps did a funny video of the game
[4:09:29] <@mothmandraws> only good thing he brought was the edgy vincent songs
[4:09:29] <%Hoot_Patoots> Sephirth at home
[4:09:30] <%bevyrage> don't forget that GAKT also did a bunch of music
[4:09:32] <%Solid_Stro> The most horrible addition
[4:09:32] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Wasn't there a terrible action game where Gact was the main character?
[4:09:33] <%Dragon_Batman> And Genesis was awful
[4:09:33] <+PlagueOfGripes> and everyone gets angel wings!
[4:09:33] <%JoshyJ> and its sweet
[4:09:33] <%mankeyfigh> And?
[4:09:34] <+Remery_> Sephiroth's has a lot of family
[4:09:34] <%BisoromiBear> donut steel
[4:09:35] <%boki_86> @PatStaresAt he is also in Dirge of cerberus
[4:09:36] <%CursedNobleman> canon self inserts LUL
[4:09:36] <%spiritofmojave> not essentially, IS
[4:09:38] <%siamzero94> Sephiroth but bad
[4:09:39] <%heartlesshealer> !!!
[4:09:40] <%TimetodiveLTX> while we're explaining things, what's poochie
[4:09:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Whats wrong with that?
[4:09:42] <%LaughingCatt> Genesis is incredibly obnoxious
[4:09:43] <%ShichiNoBushi> He was also the main character of Bujingai.
[4:09:43] <%SvenHolgersson> Gunna be honest is Gackt like some fucking singer or?
[4:09:44] <%lotharrio> "I'm gonna be Sephiroth's brother and rival, who has a bigger dick!"
[4:09:44] <%pureotome> CHEST
[4:09:46] <%mankeyfigh> So what Genesis might get in?
[4:09:48] <%KawaiiJetty> Pat you failed to mention the army of Gackts
[4:09:48] <%Xenokhrist> he had that sick fight scene in the combat sim with Seph and Angeal
[4:09:49] <%Solid_Stro> Discount Sephiroth aka Genesis
[4:09:52] <%CursedNobleman> seriously, what it poochie
[4:09:52] <%lucaflowe> Wasn't he like almost as good as Sephiroth too or some shit?
[4:09:52] <%Dakuu75> @DedlokPM lol well. I mean if you're paying for it, I guess that's fair.
[4:09:55] <%PadreHail> They'll probably rewrite the shit out of Genesis if they bring him back
[4:09:57] <%boogaleeboo> It's amazing that that game has a character with white wings called Angeal that still isn't as a fucking anime as the guy Gackt plays
[4:09:57] <%CelioHogane> WE ARE SO CLOSE TO BEST BOY
[4:09:58] <%heartlesshealer> We gonna see it?!
[4:09:58] <+Remery_> Yazoo, Kadaj and Rufus
[4:09:58] <%starotter70> Hojo is deaf as fuck
[4:10:00] <%clumbos_edgier_uncle> He does have a dope ass sword tho
[4:10:00] <%averyoddjew> also cannon present in neibelheim
[4:10:01] <%j0ustar> Oh look cum jars
[4:10:05] <%realm_forge> I totally thought you were talking about Gaxx
[4:10:05] <%GarbageQueenEllie> There must be DROVES of fanfiction where the gang doesn't escape Hojo's lab here
[4:10:05] <%mankeyfigh> no too sneaky
[4:10:06] <%optimasmaximas> HOW
[4:10:08] <%Dragon_Batman> Gackt even made music for Dirge, and he is the reason why we will most likely never get ports for those games
[4:10:12] <+PlagueOfGripes> "No compilation shit, okay, Squeenix?" "Haha of course, of course"
[4:10:12] <%PadreHail> If anything's getting retconned it's Genesis

[4:13:00] <%KawaiiJetty> Yup
[4:13:01] <%Keyd00d> it was a mess of polygons
[4:13:01] <%Scarnehu> chuthulu?
[4:13:03] <%patriotrenegade> Cthulu fhtagn! Cthulu fhtagn!! Ia! Ia! Ia! Ia!
[4:13:03] <%Aydarkzero> cool
[4:13:03] <%Wurmspawn> You fight him immediately after rescuing Aerith and before meeting Red XIII
[4:13:04] <%Guardiansaiyan> Mister X?!
[4:13:04] <%Sir_stride> right after RED 13
[4:13:06] <%QuadraticGravity> Completely new model and look but same monster
[4:13:07] <%starotter70> @j0ustar Science
[4:13:08] <+PlagueOfGripes> you don't remember fighting it with Red?
[4:13:09] <%cowardman93> you fought him in the OG after getting Aerith out of the tube
[4:13:10] <%XenomorphicTendencies> he looks so much better jesus
[4:13:12] <%CursedNobleman> @j0ustar good sound attenuation
[4:13:12] <%snugglepuggs> Music Kreygasm
[4:13:14] <%Aracon_> it's the placement that is different
[4:13:15] <%Charonofthememe> Mako is a fuck, kill em all 2020, I am Avalanche man, 410 billion dead Shinra employees
[4:13:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @j0ustar Even Elder Gods need business meetings sometime
[4:13:20] <%Meow0369> Oh my god he's so overlevelled
[4:13:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @j0ustar Because he absorbes the mind breaking energies of meetings
[4:13:21] <%TenderBabyBacon> Oh, it
[4:13:25] <%bevyrage> this was in the original but he wasn't full of eldritch energy as much the first time around
[4:13:25] <%siamzero94> what a bitch boss
[4:13:27] <%MisterRockett> That game had so many fucked up mutant monsters it's hard to keep track of em all.
[4:13:34] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Meow0369 which means we can get to parts faster
[4:13:36] <%Dakuu75> This is a fucking Bloodborn-ass looking Bloodborn boss, lol. I love it.
[4:13:37] <%TenderBabyBacon> it's that scarecrow Jack O'lantern dude
[4:13:42] <%Guardiansaiyan> !uptime

[4:13:43] <%lucaflowe> Had the chance to shoot him and failed damn it Barret
[4:13:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I wonder who this used to be
[4:13:47] <%Meow0369> @Guardiansaiyan I hope he dies to the 6 bloodhounds later tho
[4:13:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PAT IS SOOOO OVERLEVEL
[4:13:59] <%Aydarkzero> dunk on cloud
[4:14:00] <%DeoxysPrime> This guy really reminds me of the Omega Pirate from Metroid Prime
[4:14:03] <%Guardiansaiyan> @GarbageQueenEllie I am thinking Chiefe Irons
[4:14:03] <%CelioHogane> DID CLOUD JUST SAID FUCK?
[4:14:08] <+Remery_> The Cthulu Slam
[4:14:14] <%Aydarkzero> @DeoxysPrime man i miss the Prime games
[4:14:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> @CelioHogane Probably
[4:14:22] <%CelioHogane> I swear i heard Cloud say "Oh fuck"
[4:14:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @CelioHogane he doesn't even know what it means
[4:14:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> He swears a lot
[4:14:26] <%Keyd00d> Prime 4...

[4:14:38] <%tigerfang86> BIRKIN EYES

[4:14:40] <%Nupinoop296> nice G virus monster
[4:14:41] <%Daskolin> AWWWWWWWWWWW
[4:14:42] <%Bluwizard21> Someone was playing resident evil
[4:14:43] <%Aracon_> aww it's little zelda monsters
[4:14:47] <%Emperor_Machinus> A Cthulu
[4:14:47] <%XenomorphicTendencies> @DeoxysPrime he looks like he has more of a Prime 2 Space Pirate thing going on wih the claws
[4:14:47] <%Meow0369> Wait did he get the last summon or is that post game
[4:14:47] <%boogaleeboo> Pats old friend, z-targetable eye growth
[4:14:48] <%maenos2> That is just a BOW
[4:14:50] <%CelioHogane> @Engwithan_Elder_God well, tecnically Hojo did it
[4:14:52] <%karl_rex> Is this the future Chariot Requiem will give us?
[4:14:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> TEKTITES

[4:14:59] <%WhereIsWill> SourPls
[4:15:01] <%boki_86> @CelioHogane yeah and i hear Barret saying Fuck all this instead of Suck on this
[4:15:09] <%YakumoYomi> The G is for "Gackt"
[4:15:09] <%Guardiansaiyan> the ULTIMATE BIO WEAPON
[4:15:13] <%SaphronBlackbourne> *RE Title Voice* FINAL FANTASY... 7!
[4:15:15] <%Hoot_Patoots> god barret is so tanky i love hime
[4:15:15] <%CelioHogane> @boki_86 no, but Barred definetly says fuck
[4:15:18] <%Aracon_> they look like little gohma babies
[4:15:19] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> WHy are we fighting a tyrant?!
[4:15:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> The G is for GENITALIA
[4:15:26] <%Robot_Nixon_> @Meow0369 he didn't it requires all magic materia maxed. so probably post game
[4:15:29] <%Dragon_Batman> Hojo let him out
[4:15:36] <%controlzer0> wouldn't breeding aerith with a G soldier be a terrible idea since their whole thing is they fall apart in like 2 seconds like a cheap drugstore toy ?
[4:15:38] <%Guardiansaiyan> @TurtlesAndTentacles Umbrella partiially funded this lab
[4:15:43] <%logoth_> The ultimate bio weapon
[4:15:53] <%heartlesshealer> SUMMONS ADDS
[4:15:55] <%Guardiansaiyan> Nemesis is in next room being hit with Rail Gun
[4:15:55] <%starotter70> Hojo WOULD work at Umbrella
[4:16:03] <%Aydarkzero> he would
[4:16:05] <%CelioHogane> You know, Knowing Hojo, im surprised they don't have huge vaginas so he can breed them later
[4:16:09] <%Guardiansaiyan> Mister X is in one of the Test tubes
[4:16:09] <%PanicSwytch> GLOBAL SATURATION
[4:16:10] <%XenomorphicTendencies> Hojo would be a director at Umbrella
[4:16:13] <@mothmandraws> umbrella is too ethical for him
[4:16:15] <%Aracon_> hojo would be the leading scientist of umbrellas
[4:16:17] <%Dakuu75> @Meow0369 I don't think so because he hasn't done the battle simulations in this area yet
[4:16:21] <@mothmandraws> he would want to have mrx fuck something
[4:16:21] <%Bane_Kaikyo> How come Pat never Summons?
[4:16:22] <%optimasmaximas> @ShawnTK_ you can get it first run, just tough
[4:16:23] <%spiritofmojave> @guardiansaiyan or drowning in a pool cause bitch can't even swim~
[4:16:29] <%CelioHogane> Umbrella would be like "YO WHAT THE FUCK DUDE"
[4:16:30] <%Guardiansaiyan> @spiritofmojave rofl
[4:16:31] <%j0ustar> The shock resistance is this building Christ
[4:16:40] <%Balsty> watching pat overcap his ATB on multiple characters has me on the edge of a stroke
[4:16:45] <%Aracon_> that's the worst
[4:16:51] <%WhereIsWill> no stagger fun for u!
[4:16:54] <%WritebroAlpha> Ah yes, THE ULTIMATE BIO-WEAPON
[4:17:04] <%cvp5127> no fun allowed
[4:17:04] <%Aracon_> gotta have a cutscene so no damage for you
[4:17:06] <%Dakuu75> why did the stagger bar straight up go from 75% to zero after it started?
[4:17:07] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Guys Umbrella is the company that makes bioweapons from torturing children I think they'd be cool with this
[4:17:09] <%CelioHogane> Oh hey, Mako eyes
[4:17:10] <%Aydarkzero> monkaS
[4:17:12] <%valriot> CLOUDS GONNA DIE LUL
[4:17:13] <%Meow0369> He made all his dudes blind

[4:17:26] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> JILL!
[4:17:27] <%karl_rex> Hojo you're pathetic and you're gay!
[4:17:29] <%Wurmspawn> I just love the music in this game so much.
[4:17:30] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I mean TIFA
[4:17:30] <%Robot_Nixon_> at this point I just assume all stagger states are phases
[4:17:32] <%amused_platypus> mako poisoning?
[4:17:33] <%CelioHogane> @Emperor_Machinus no dude, they have MAKO EYES
[4:17:35] <%YakumoYomi> @Bane_Kaikyo Ask, and ye shall receive
[4:17:36] <%SH1NK1R0> @dakuu75 go gate. Enemies transition to new phase and reset their stagger
[4:17:36] <%GarbageQueenEllie> spam MEGIDOLAON
[4:17:37] <%Guardiansaiyan> where is Chris to punch this guy?!
[4:17:41] <%Guardiansaiyan> W E S K E R
