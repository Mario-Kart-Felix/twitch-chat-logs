[0:43:41] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> at 8 feet, it should be about 80
[0:43:42] <troxvon_the_lesser> BARF AT SMALL FOV
[0:43:43] <koffeemancer> So does this game have romance options? or is it too early to know that
[0:43:47] <misterspotswood> >canadian >uses feet
[0:43:48] <%iamtrlly> iamtrlly subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:43:49] <Monkeyweed21> SET FOV TO 76
[0:43:49] <%Saltmeisterr> God u guys are disgusting
[0:43:50] <%bread_assassin> The option to make helmet invisible is the greatest. Change my Mind.
[0:43:56] <%Niney_Who> COMBO OR BIG NUMBER
[0:43:56] <@SSaryn> OOOOO
[0:43:59] <bsmusic> But what about *us* Pat?

[0:43:59] <%Jaxnos> time for long setup, hope y'all ready
[0:44:00] <%CrossCottonwood> 300 FOV minimum
[0:44:00] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> ooooh that is nice
[0:44:02] <@lewdskeletor13> This game does not have romance options, they said that early on
[0:44:07] <+OperatorPlease> hmmmmmmmmm
[0:44:07] <%Saltmeisterr> cool
[0:44:10] <%Stevennapalm> damage or dirtbag piece of shit?
[0:44:10] <%borkmire> 110 fov all the way you cowards
[0:44:10] <%xemnahort> imma play this on my steam controller because I don't have the set up for mouse and keyboard and all my other controllers shit the bed
[0:44:11] <King_Wolf_Rigger> 76 FOV is a good one, very nice
[0:44:11] <derap41> Did it mention over what time
[0:44:13] <%GrayMatterMiner> then its trash
[0:44:14] <Psyramics> why is there no 'both' setting
[0:44:14] <troxvon_the_lesser> QUAKE LEVEL FOV OR NOTHING
[0:44:15] <%Dr_Mooose> Dr_Mooose subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:44:16] <+GimmMeUhSammich> BIG NUMBER OR COMBO
[0:44:17] <+Darren716> Eh kinda wish they'd so both
[0:44:19] <Decsevm> if FOV isn't 110 makes me sad
[0:44:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oho, interesting
[0:44:20] <%starotter70> @lewdskeletor13 What's the point then?
[0:44:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @lewdskeletor13 I can't fuck a robot again? boo
[0:44:23] <bbqshapez> DPS IS BIG COMBO DAM FOR BIG NUBER
[0:44:24] <DracaenaLeaf> Pat the BIG DAMAGE guy wants DPS instead of Damage?
[0:44:24] <nuane> cool
[0:44:24] <%iamtrlly> Peach doesnt stream as much anymore so heres my free money
[0:44:26] <derap41> Yes do that no minimaxing
[0:44:30] <TDAWS_MP132> It lets some be secret
[0:44:33] <+linSP> but i wanna know when there's a super dumb option
[0:44:35] <+Darren716> new vegas was still the best where it swapped between dps and dam
[0:44:37] <her0_89> Pat how much of the weapon stats have you seen? Cause number go up
[0:44:38] <+Chilly_Lich> Just like Fallouts 1 and 2 where dialogue will only pop up when you had actual skill for them?
[0:44:39] <Dutchpotato> Yeah that’s great
[0:44:43] <%Typhaeon> DPS is a stupid term
[0:44:45] <+Maleicus> i like knowing if i missed something myself
[0:44:45] <Nerdwarp112> @angriestpat Hey Pat I have no idea how in-depth the character creation is, but I hope you make your character either super cool-looking or super scummy-looking
[0:44:48] <bbqshapez> Pat knows Big number is the inferior metric
[0:44:49] <%Typhaeon> change my mind
[0:44:52] <derap41> nah
[0:45:00] <proto_char> so many QOL options
[0:45:04] <Dakuu75> these menus are getting Chat super-excited
[0:45:04] <derap41> like when you enter a new zone
[0:45:12] <$MetalPanic> a super cool scumbag
[0:45:14] <+joekuta71> Cool scum
[0:45:15] <@lewdskeletor13> These are really good options

[0:45:24] <%Dr_Mooose> coumy
[0:45:24] <+dirtyh4rr1> he can do himself, so YES
[0:45:25] <dredshift> How would his character look super cool if he always makes them look like himself?
[0:45:26] <derap41> Do what the game tells you pay
[0:45:27] <pmtriox> it's either DPS or "damage bitch"
[0:45:27] <$Remery_> Cummy Pat
[0:45:28] <%GrayMatterMiner> dps and damage numbers have very specific places of use
[0:45:28] <%nevan0> scummyyyyyyy
[0:45:28] <derap41> patÄ
[0:45:28] <AtisutoCurry> so much choice i love it
[0:45:29] <Bigyin396> "I bet I can do both". Will succeed at neither
[0:45:29] <@SSaryn> That's pretty good
[0:45:30] <+yasahiro1011> !outerworlds

[1:25:52] <%konekoryugamine> I love that we can just add SPACE to the beginning of something for this game and it makes it justified
[1:25:54] <SparkAfterDark> cavemen live in caves, thus making them categorically unable to be hobos

[1:26:10] <+foomaster22> Shoot him Kappa
[1:26:11] <%Valdorick> You had 3 and just looted 2, didn't you? Needed 5?
[1:26:15] <+MrN64> You can unlock pickpocketing later, I think?
[1:26:16] <Trillex56> or should have enough anyway
[1:26:16] <Fujiwara_92> you have just enpugh
[1:26:16] <%konekoryugamine> YES. SPACE ELMO
[1:26:17] <%Shadicara> He just got two so he can probably do it

[1:26:25] <Dutchpotato> U could pickpocket him if he was dead

[2:10:42] <@commanderclaw> How descriptive
[2:10:43] <%Aeoneth> i think he meant time wait
[2:10:44] <MrJoeJoe> under ship

[2:11:35] <garbageheaphound> kinda
[2:11:36] <@lewdskeletor13> The game is radical

[2:11:41] <+KingGoblodyte> @AngriestPat Can you swim?

[2:11:48] <troxvon_the_lesser> @AngiestPat How are those planets that close?
[2:11:51] <Vakojin> Have you tried going in the ship from the front ?
[2:11:51] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Chat can only help as much as it hurts
[2:11:54] <$Remery_> chat is usually more horny than helpful
[2:11:56] <@lewdskeletor13> You can’t swim
[2:11:57] <%konekoryugamine> Oh my god dude GET BACK ON TRACK
[2:12:04] <%Run44forrest> pat you missed an item where your ship crashed

[2:12:16] <%dekkitout> Now why is that a location?
[2:12:16] <CapCasual> @AngriestPat It was behind the big debris closer to the dogs.
[2:12:21] <%Niney_Who> Maybe you just can't swim in the ocean

[2:12:47] <%Mendin> This is Pat Stares At, not Pat Pro LPs

[2:20:10] <trueherobappo> @AngriestPat How you enjoying the game so far brother???
[2:20:13] <%Ayotocorp> Ayotocorp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Oh boy, 14 months! That's about how long I too have been locked into corporate servitude.

[2:20:19] <$Remery_> Subsribe to your local grave
[2:20:20] <+Lost_Zombie> This is only slightly past renting mining tools to miners and then charging them doubly when the tools broke
[2:20:21] <%MelBrooksKA> CAAAtrapitalism
[2:20:22] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat the corpses are also considered company property. because CAPITALISM
[2:20:22] <+twohitgood> why does the name abernathy sound familiar?

[2:20:28] <%Animorphimagi> DARK af
[2:20:29] <fatally_furious> is Spacer's choice related to Player Choice, are their graves microtransactions?
[2:20:30] <%konekoryugamine> Space Cannery
[2:20:31] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat These Gravesites are just Surprise Mechanics
[2:20:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> This game has promise, but this whole first area is suuuuper uncomfortable.
[2:20:34] <Vigonept> THE ACCURSEE
[2:20:35] <Alseid> well considering some cemeteries have "maintenance fees" and if you don't pay they remove your dead, it already happens
[2:20:36] <nobknee> LUL

[2:21:52] <%Mendin> So would you say with this cannibal problem... that there's No Ethical Consumption Under Capitalism?
[2:21:53] <%Valdorick> The dead just didn't love the Brand enough.

[2:22:11] <$realm_forge> THE PLAGUE CALKED COMMUNISM
[2:22:13] <SparkAfterDark> I'm detecting a slight political undertone in this game
[2:22:13] <%TIME_PUNCHER> "Eeeeh it's just another virulent plague."
[2:22:15] <old_dog_god> Just vape the plague away
[2:22:15] <Ner234> These people have NO fucks left to give.
[2:22:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> @BoboDaHobo The people are the property. The bodies are the property too.

[2:27:14] <%ElderDeku> apatWhat
[2:27:14] <trueherobappo> Oh my lord that is a very short crouch

[2:27:15] <+hahyeahok> Yeah its called living in New York
[2:27:16] <%aeonicvector> @AngriestPat didnt pay rent, gotta take back that door and wall
[2:27:16] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @AngriestPat Doors are for WINNERS
[2:27:17] <ivansonic08> Pricavy is expensive

[2:27:20] <old_dog_god> “Yeah I’m shittin’. So what? Keep walkin’.”
[2:27:20] <BlindGato> Spacers CHOICE!
[2:27:20] <deafmutelaughing> door is for Premium Employees
[2:27:21] <misterspotswood> its so other employees can snitch on you for taking poop breaks too much when youre not actually pooping
[2:27:21] <%RoninRorinth> get tha shit smell all over the house
[2:27:21] <atravelbee> gotta make those budget cuts
[2:27:22] <%konekoryugamine> NO STEALING DAMMIT

[2:43:36] <redrins> outer wilds eh
[2:43:41] <Mad_Morpho> good luck
[2:43:42] <%GarbageNirvana> It's kind of amazing
[2:43:49] <%marsanta> It's almost like not having to use bethesdas horrible engine fixes a lot
[2:43:49] <Zebylth> you said wilds pat
[2:43:52] <daisyyyy> They had time to bugfix
[2:43:54] <old_dog_god> It’s not a Bethesda game, truly
[2:43:54] <serra255> outer wilds....
[2:43:54] <%PalmtopNami> gamepass for 1 dollar
[2:43:54] <Jetsfantasy> It's insane that we have to think that though
[2:43:56] <+cicatjb> waiting for "mods"
[2:43:57] <+Vayatan> who knew not using Bethesda's engine = good game
[2:43:59] <Thorn14> I havent found a single glitch in PC
[2:44:05] <Hiruzen93> you also modded the hell out of new vegas
[2:44:06] <$Remery_> gamepass is a dollar dude
[2:44:06] <%3Xgilly> Does anyone know when the switch release comes out?
[2:44:09] <TyrantBelial> Probably completely unmoddable
[2:44:11] <catwithsunglasses> there's a rumor going around that they finished the game a long time ago, but held shit back to get all the bugs fixed
[2:44:14] <%Jaxnos> i've only seen weird loading in jumpiness, but no actual bugs.
[2:44:18] <%ShineTheDiamond> Anyone else getting odd audio peaking?
[2:44:22] <%ShineTheDiamond> Just me?

[3:01:11] <Teyaric> This game REALLY likes "behind the doodad" hidden items
[3:01:12] <WarchiefGoldva> It feels really good to play a western-feeling game with an acoustic guitar playing in the background.
[3:01:15] <ivansonic08> @CrabSlacks Breaking bad intro?
[3:01:16] <%BoboDaHobo> man, this seems like a fantastic game that I'd never be able to appreciate

[3:17:12] <WarchiefGoldva> Hol up. Shotgun uses light ammo?
[3:17:15] <$realm_forge> Cheek clappin ammo
[3:17:15] <+Adalore> at minimum it'll win in novelty because it isn't fallout, for the umpteth time in the hands of bethesda.
[3:17:16] <+Zutrax> It uses heavy ammo
[3:17:16] <%AncelDeLambert> it looks so gooooood

[3:18:18] <Jetsfantasy> Fuck that saying
[3:18:19] <cherrycottontail> so this is just a bethesdagame and nothing different, huh?
[3:18:21] <%ShineTheDiamond> Ooof
[3:18:24] <artificiallynatural> when life gives you lemons, burn the town down
[3:18:25] <IminyourBase> yeah you be happy with your lemons SWINE

[3:18:33] <+AllenDeadman> yeah... let's burn this company to the ground
[3:18:37] <%kujofire990> ah geez gill
[3:18:38] <%Niney_Who> That's Cannery
[3:18:41] <%dekkitout> This IS a Bethesda game- except it's well made
[3:18:44] <+hahyeahok> @cherrycottontail, bery incorrect
[3:18:45] <+Adalore> It's nice to see another style take on retrofuture though
[3:18:48] <ProfBadger> literally 'memory hole him'
[3:18:48] <WarchiefGoldva> @cherrycottontail It's not a Bethesdagame. This one actually functions.
[3:18:49] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @cherrycottontail more like Bethesda games are just Obsidian games with more bugs
[3:18:56] <The_Gonzales_Experience> when life gives you lemons LIGHT UP THE NIGHT, THERE IS A CITY THIS DARKNESS CAN'T HIDE
[3:18:56] <Jetsfantasy> How long until a mod that swaps "Spacer's Choice" with "Bethesda"?
[3:18:56] <%ShineTheDiamond> @cherrycottontail So far it has a polish to it that Bethesda aspires to but never achieves
[3:18:59] <BleedinActionMan> @cherrycottontail It was made by the people who made the only good bethesdagame
[3:19:00] <%Teintstein> they really like "disabuse"
[3:19:07] <%Niney_Who> Wait so are the Posters LIES?
[3:19:12] <$Remery_> Purge
[3:19:15] <%Mendin> "If you see something, say nothing. And drink to forget"
[3:19:16] <tigerfang86> DRINK THE MEMORY AWAY
[3:19:16] <+Adalore> They put stuff in the water bro.
[3:19:16] <+RealThiele> can you ride a horse up a mountain to victory though?
[3:19:17] <@lewdskeletor13> From your MEMORY
[3:19:22] <ProfBadger> well yeah, disabuse carries the right tone
[3:19:23] <+Sinetha> O SHIT
[3:19:32] <+RyuMojo> RELIGION BANNED
[3:19:36] <UnfilteredComic> Flouride?
[3:19:36] <+AllenDeadman> it's alcohol
[3:19:37] <TG_Cid11> its just space booze
[3:19:39] <$realm_forge> It’s got what plants crave
[3:19:40] <%Run44forrest> drink it
[3:19:41] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat Wait does that mean the posters were lying to make them sound super evil?
[3:19:41] <+forlorncarton> just booze
[3:19:42] <+Adalore> It's for worker efficiency.
[3:19:42] <ScreamLord> It's booze
[3:19:43] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @AngriestPat Class A Amnestic
[3:19:43] <The_Gonzales_Experience> LITERALLY DRINK TO FORGET

[3:31:04] <%Gogogolem> these people don't seem to own anything so your stealing from the company
[3:31:04] <TwitchingFrog> You see, guys, the corporation pay these people, they buy things, and Pat steals those things, so he's just sticking it to the corporations, man.
[3:31:07] <+brightman42> missed an NPC that wanted to talk to you about abernathy
[3:31:10] <bendatron> cue GOBLINs
[3:31:11] <%Jrocy247> weird....
[3:31:11] <+LightLifter> Ah they cant be removed, TIME TO NEVER USE THEM
[3:31:11] <%dekkitout> Welp- I smell a community mod already
[3:31:12] <flyingavocad0s> @forlorncarton Without the fish
[3:31:15] <Louie_Salmon> Ugh, that means I will never mod anything
[3:31:20] <star_feline> So new vegas mods, do you remember when they said it wasn't gonna be like new vegas?
[3:31:22] <+Sinetha> @Louie_Salmon YUP
[3:31:25] <+RealThiele> kill corporate cogs, break the machine
[3:31:26] <%dekkitout> The "Mods Can Be Removed" mod
[3:31:29] <+Lost_Zombie> @AngriestPat Don't worry too much about using the mods. I've already gotten duplicates and I'm right around where you are still.
[3:31:31] <%FacetiousAF> my gobolins would deny me weapon modding :/
[3:31:31] <+FrenchTact1cs> OperationRage against system of a down
[3:31:40] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Noo, don't waste it on garbo weapons
[3:31:43] <%LiquidShake83> only use mods on apatElmo
[3:31:45] <TwitchingFrog> Did you say a 60 mag drum?
[3:31:51] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Y'know what you gotta do Pat? Burn the town down. BURN. THEM. ALL!
[3:32:03] <+Reveresao> @angriestpat go back you miss talking to someone
[3:32:06] <%LiquidShake83> cyber apatGib doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeam
[3:32:14] <%ArtisanCheese> OH MY GOD PAT
[3:32:15] <+Walopoh> I'm slowly realizing that Pat will inevitably sell out to a MegaCorp in a "bad" ending
[3:32:16] <%Niney_Who> Pat you just wasted one
[3:32:16] <RyanTheRecluse> You get heaps of mods, don’t be afraid to use them
[3:32:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> @ScreamLord nonononon burn down the CEOS
[3:32:21] <+VoytekBus> Gun go up?
[3:32:23] <ZE_Count> Is this game easy to Mod?
[3:32:23] <KaliasTV> Did he overwrite his first mod?
[3:32:25] <%ThatOneGameTester> womp womp
[3:32:26] <%dekkitout> I'm sure scopes will do something
[3:32:27] <%ArtisanCheese> you only got the one mod
[3:32:29] <StromkoPenguin> Those both modified the same thing, pretty sure it overwrote the first mod
[3:32:32] <%Niney_Who> Pat you just Deleted your first Mod
[3:32:34] <%Niney_Who> LUL
[3:32:35] <ScreamLord> @CappuccinoGuil That also works
[3:32:35] <%ThatOneGameTester> stuttering?
[3:32:44] <+Lost_Zombie> He did overwrite the first one. Each slot can only handle one mod

[3:32:58] <@lewdskeletor13> Clancy from RE7

[3:33:49] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> is this the good game?
[3:33:54] <NumbusPlays> it's just standing there. MENACINGLY
[3:33:59] <BlindGato> Space Vegas
[3:34:00] <StromkoPenguin> It's sorta like Borderlands humor if it were funny instead of LOUD
[3:34:01] <%GarbageNirvana> New Vegalands
[3:34:02] <star_feline> New Vegas World
[3:34:03] <%Niney_Who> You did. You Put Mag Zap and Mag-Num
[3:34:08] <%Niney_Who> They were both Magazine mods
[3:34:14] <+Qsmash_> NV2 PogChamp
[3:34:18] <Calamity2007> This is the future that House wanted
[3:34:21] <%Niney_Who> Mad-Num would have made it go to 16 ammo
[3:34:24] <%Niney_Who> You still have 8
[3:34:26] <+forlorncarton> zap mag!
[3:34:26] <%Run44forrest> that guitar wang thats some Cowboy Bebop shit
[3:34:26] <+hahyeahok> @theheronobodyneeded, IMO yeah and i didnt think i would like it either
[3:34:29] <%ape_hawk> mistakes into mods
[3:34:47] <+Havictos> @ZE_Count But they said they would like to put it in later
[3:34:53] <RyanTheRecluse> @angriestpat explore this building again once you get the first party member girl
[3:34:58] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> is this open world?
[3:35:04] <$realm_forge> This game could legit start some shit here in the US
[3:35:05] <%Niney_Who> !spoilers
[3:35:08] <%Niney_Who> No spoiling chat
[3:35:10] <$zackalan> Kappa100 I know how to explain what an RPG is to Woolie. A RPG is where you can assign one or more characters to a specific role. Legend of Zelda is not an RPG because Link can only become a better version of Link. Dark Souls is an RPG because you can be a pyromancer, or a swift dex build, or a tanky strength build. Indivisible isn't an RPG because nobody can be changed to a role. Choosing a party member in that game is like choosing what guns you carry with you in a shooter.
[3:35:14] <+VoytekBus> Any room can be the toilet
[3:35:17] <%ape_hawk> why do you think?
[3:35:19] <SixthSun2> Why wouldn't it be?
[3:35:19] <Axelbr> @theheronobodyneeded no ? It's hub based game
[3:35:22] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s semi-open world
[3:35:23] <%dekkitout> Araki forgot?
[3:35:25] <+zagethemage> Going to sleep GN chat and Pat, hope the game continues to be good
[3:35:25] <Axelbr> No*
[3:35:28] <@lewdskeletor13> It has zones
[3:35:31] <$i_am_therydon> you cant lockpick a trashcan?
[3:35:39] <star_feline> New Vegas forgot
[3:35:39] <TDAWS_MP132> maybe it's the community center?
[3:35:47] <+hahyeahok> Spoilers? NaM
[3:35:48] <%honeyman18> You can't steal from a corporation, they aren't people.
[3:35:59] <%GarbageNirvana> @zackalan So by that logic a lot of Final Fantasy games aren't really RPGs either
[3:36:07] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> @Axelbr @lewdskeletor13 thanks friendos it looks interesting i might pick it up
[3:36:18] <%miguelrod777> jesus
[3:36:18] <%BoboDaHobo> @zackalan ff4 is an RPG but everyone has a set class
[3:36:24] <+Havictos> @zackalan I really don't want to hear Pat shit on it any more it actually upset me to hear him talk like that. I honestly thought he would like it.
[3:36:40] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> @honeyman18 i thought Wendy from Wendy's was our friend
[3:36:47] <ZE_Count> Pat make sure to crouch and look under stuff!
[3:36:53] <+nekodelic> @zackalan in the case of a party-based rpg, the party is your build
[3:36:58] <%dekkitout> A kit for thuggery you say?
[3:37:04] <%GarbageNirvana> I do like how it looks like Pat's character is just one bad turn away from crazy space hobo
[3:37:09] <WarchiefGoldva> I gotta go sleep, man. I'm falling apart here.
[3:37:14] <%Stevennapalm> didnt know marvel was a weapon mod
[3:37:16] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @TheHeroNobodyNeeded The Wendy meme is our friend, but the company is not.
[3:37:16] <old_dog_god> He was a hobo earlier
[3:37:19] <WarchiefGoldva> Good night everyone.
[3:37:22] <%ShineTheDiamond> @Havictos To be fair, Pat said he knew it was a good game, it just wasn't his taste
[3:37:26] <Marpolo13> @GarbageNirvana implying he didn't start out as one
[3:37:27] <%DedlokPM> @GarbageNirvana which is hilarious because he looks like pat
[3:37:31] <Kain5707> @AngriestPat i just found a sniper
[3:37:32] <%FacetiousAF> night goldva
[3:37:34] <%BoboDaHobo> @warchiefgoldva have a good night
[3:37:46] <+xBolts4Lifex> ALL HAIL BELL
[3:37:53] <$zackalan> @GarbageNirvana you can still customize people for a specific task. Take ff10 Kimahri. You can make him a melee dps like Auron, or a caster type. Just because people have a set class doesn't mean they can be adjusted for a specific role
[3:37:55] <star_feline> Is it bad that I almost disregarded this stream completely because I confused Outer Worlds and Outer Wilds LUL
[3:38:12] <%Aeoneth> @star_feline So did Pat
[3:38:12] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> @King_Wolf_Rigger what about the Chihuahua from Taco Bell?
[3:38:12] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[3:38:12] <Louie_Salmon> @zackalan I think that's pretty succinct. Also makes "Role Playing Game" a relevant genre title.
[3:38:19] <BeeNoons> damn
[3:38:20] <%dekkitout> Hey- Outer WILDS is a good game...
[3:38:21] <%Faustgesicht> Except tone. That shit bleak
[3:38:23] <+Havictos> @ShineTheDiamond He said that but then went on to rant about how everything but the art was a waste of time. He seemed way too harsh on it
[3:38:23] <%dekkitout> Philistine...
[3:38:30] <+Chilly_Lich> Optimus reference.
[3:38:36] <SubliminaIMessages> smooth like skippy
[3:38:39] <Calamity2007> For those who have the PS4 version, how does it run?
[3:38:47] <Marpolo13> @Havictos which game?
[3:38:50] <$Remery_> All they eat is Tuna
[3:38:51] <%mordred_t> Har to say.
[3:38:55] <%Run44forrest> how would he have known it was plagued guard lady???
[3:38:56] <%mordred_t> I'll tell you in 24 minutes.
[3:38:57] <$zackalan> I was just frustrated with woolie failing to understand what an RPG is
[3:38:58] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @TheHeroNobodyNeeded The chihuahua is fine, as while it may be a mascot, it is not the company itself.
[3:38:58] <%GarbageNirvana> You mean like the food you stole from that dude who totally had the plague
[3:39:00] <+Havictos> @Marpolo13 Indivisible
[3:39:00] <BeeNoons> you gotta eat food that isn't yours, that's what corporate culture is
[3:39:00] <%Over_ninek> starting to think the plague is another system of control
[3:39:02] <%BoboDaHobo> @zackalan what about ff4 though, there's no customization, just better version with each level
[3:39:03] <dickbuttwoman> Bioshock on top
[3:39:05] <star_feline> I'd say Bioshock and New Vegas
[3:39:06] <Marpolo13> @Havictos ah k thx
[3:39:06] <a_mad_dragon> corporations are the sith
[3:39:10] <old_dog_god> Don’t eat anything Plague give you, lads
[3:39:12] <BlindGato> Where are my lightsabers
[3:39:14] <arkv01> we're already there
[3:39:14] <%AncelDeLambert> stop listing things I like, Pat
[3:39:16] <%Saltmeisterr> EXISTENTIAL PROFIT
[3:39:17] <%WhereIsWill> sprinkle some bioshock on it
[3:39:21] <%dekkitout> So a mix of good rpg's with a corporate, fatalistic tone
[3:39:22] <arkv01> amazon workers just die on the floor and you keep chugging
[3:39:23] <King_Wolf_Rigger> And Cyberpunk
[3:39:26] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> existential GROFIT
[3:39:27] <+Chilly_Lich> As opposed to New Vegas which was more about imperialist governments.
[3:39:28] <+xBolts4Lifex> Wow really? I might need to check this out then
[3:39:30] <+VoytekBus> Pocket's revenge!
[3:39:32] <$zackalan> @BoboDaHobo I haven't played ff4 so I can't make a judgment on that
[3:39:35] <%Agami23> what was it you said on the podcast? theres no such thing as moral capitaliism or something?
[3:39:36] <BallinArbiter> 3 fantastic games in one
[3:39:37] <+gutlesscoward> new kotorshock
[3:39:37] <+Forente> rampant capitalism
[3:39:38] <%Mendin> So is Saltuna Salmon-Tuna or Salt-Tuna
[3:39:39] <Alseid> Corporatism via Chinese Social Credit maybe
[3:39:42] <Thorn14> The Art Decor is very Bioshock
[3:39:43] <%Run44forrest> the plagues in the saltuna monkaS
[3:39:45] <Smileyhat> When corporations become so powerful they become communist governments.
[3:39:46] <%Saltmeisterr> too bad bioshock is dead
[3:39:46] <UnfilteredComic> It really makes you FEEL like Bioshock

[3:39:49] <%GarbageNirvana> I wonder if this game will give you the opportunity to systematically assassinate the members of the Board one by one
[3:39:49] <%TheAsianAvenger96> Its like the Czerka corp in kotor
[3:39:50] <SubliminaIMessages> borderlands has the corporate stuff in it but it wasn't explored in the third game at all
[3:39:50] <Marpolo13> wait you mean to tell me that the CORPORATION is the BAD GUY? who woulda thunk it
[3:39:51] <%ShineTheDiamond> Lol
[3:39:52] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Mendin Yes
[3:39:52] <%BoboDaHobo> @zackalan fair enough
[3:39:53] <+nekodelic> late stage capitalism: the game
[3:39:53] <fizzics_> this game worth getting boyos?
[3:39:54] <zevitunez> does the game run smooth?
[3:39:55] <Calamity2007> I am getting a lot of Infinite vibes
[3:39:58] <old_dog_god> Can’t be Bioshock until I see a god damn lighthouse
[3:39:58] <ProfBadger> This is like someone saw bioshock and thought 'Bioshock uses subtext, and it's a COWARD'
[3:40:01] <IminyourBase> like a warm bowl of soup on a rainy day
[3:40:02] <%Kazooki_Kazami> Just tuned in, how does path think about it?
[3:40:02] <%ArtisanCheese> That gritty crushing weight of your nightmares incarnate?
[3:40:03] <ZE_Count> there was somthing there pat you blind
[3:40:03] <+cicatjb> if you read the background lore its an alternate timeline when anti trust laws never happened
[3:40:03] <serra255> It's like the plot to DmC: Devil May Cry, but done with taste and skill
[3:40:03] <SparkAfterDark> Finally another obsidian game that isn't bogged down with a bunch of overt political messages shoved down your throat
[3:40:04] <Vakojin> Something lit up !
[3:40:09] <%Kazooki_Kazami> *pat
[3:40:10] <BallinArbiter> Really makes you “feel” like biosuock

[3:41:42] <SparkAfterDark> this is "real fallout"
[3:41:42] <$zackalan> I was just listening to the latest castle superbeast and the whole conversation around that felt like pat was explaining color to a blind person

[3:41:44] <%RubberFistFight> @Louie_Salmon LUL
[3:41:44] <%Mendin> She tried to A-Pose to establish dominance

[3:42:39] <KaliasTV> Working all day keeps the doctor away
[3:42:39] <$zackalan> I am happy that I can buy this game through the Microsoft Store instead of Epic
[3:42:42] <Louie_Salmon> @rubberfistfight For real I think that franchise is as dead as mass effect. Fallout 76 is a financial and Goodwill failure

[3:49:55] <%ShineTheDiamond> @RubberFistFight I get that. It's a rough market to break into. You can do everything right and be skipped over for a channel that streams cats 24/7.
[3:49:56] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Work yourself to the death! =D
[3:49:57] <IminyourBase> SCIENTOLOGY LETS GO
[3:49:57] <Gieron667> so basically this religion glorifies the SYSTEM
[3:49:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> While the Vicar sems the most morally repugnant character, he's one of the first that doesn't seem kind of deplorable.
[3:49:58] <Zombrocom> It's just scientology
[3:49:59] <BourneWarrior> Literal Race Slavery
[3:50:00] <%inkboySP> I fucking love this holy shit

[3:50:27] <+Matto424> Well yeah no shit
[3:50:27] <+Grayhammatter> uh... ok bud
[3:50:28] <+VektorTroika> Daily reminder that Lawful Neutral is even more sinister than Chaotic Evil
[3:50:29] <%InugamiTheHound> apatGib apatDab xcalDab
[3:50:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> XENU is spelled with an X
[3:50:30] <televisedrevolting> So the goal is to just figure it out?
[3:50:33] <StromkoPenguin> Naw it's Scientism, totally legally distinct from Scientology, just like Hubology.
[3:50:33] <%ssjklyco> Speed Force?
[3:50:35] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat how is your thetan levels pat?

[3:50:39] <Mister_McDerp> this is very deist
[3:50:40] <Vlisragna> Isn't this Maxwell's Demon?
[3:50:40] <+Adalore> Sounds like space Calvinism.
[3:50:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> Literally space christianity
[3:50:44] <+Chilly_Lich> He's waiting for the New Moon.
[3:50:46] <+Grayhammatter> is this the time cube?
[3:50:46] <Solidus_113> Figure out Spiral Energy
[3:50:48] <Monkeyweed21> THIS IS PUCCI
[3:50:49] <%ShineTheDiamond> @RubberFistFight If I find something amiss, I will let you know as kindly as I can. Lol. I get that some people just have a rough go at things. My family seems to have the worst luch.
[3:50:50] <+twohitgood> determinism

[3:51:09] <%Run44forrest> woolie science
[3:51:10] <Xelgus> that's determinism
[3:51:11] <pectusumbra> it's a cross between determinism and maxwell's demon/laplace demon
[3:51:13] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat On spiritual side it's Deism (clockmaker universe/God)
[3:51:13] <Shastafield> calm down elon
[3:51:15] <arkv01> just chemicals bro
[3:51:16] <%inkboySP> Become as space gods

[3:51:24] <arkv01> free will is LSD
[3:51:27] <%AncelDeLambert> it's also basically impossible
[3:51:30] <SubliminaIMessages> this guy watched Jordan Peterson at least once im sure
[3:51:31] <%RubberFistFight> Hey Vicar Max - I'd like to introduce you to a concept called "quantum thermodynamic chaos". Even if you know where every particle is right now, and it's previous path, you can't POSSIBLY predict with ANY kind of confidence where they're going to be in the next interval of time. The universe runs on probabilism, not determinism.
[3:51:31] <+NitronStreams> ITS JUST CHEMICALS
[3:51:33] <Alseid> It's a nightmare but IT'S TRUE
[3:51:34] <%depressed_skeleton> Cult of woolie?
[3:51:35] <Onamar> 「FATE」
[3:51:36] <%dekkitout> That sounds like applied chaos theory
[3:51:37] <+twohitgood> determinism is reality :P
[3:51:39] <wookie5358> minority report
[3:51:39] <+Grayhammatter> OH
[3:51:40] <%ape_hawk> hes not kidding
[3:51:42] <Alseid> If Determinism isn't true, then the universe makes no sense
[3:51:43] <Ner234> OH NOOO
[3:51:43] <KasiCrafter> That's a lot of words just to say "Fate", Pat.
[3:51:44] <IminyourBase> DESTINY
[3:51:46] <The_Gonzales_Experience> WOOLIE IS SCIENCE PUCCI
[3:51:46] <Gutsandlove> jeez
[3:51:50] <%Stevennapalm> are you kidding tho
[3:51:51] <tigerfang86> welp
[3:51:53] <+KcireX09> CHEMICALS
[3:51:54] <gekizenbu> Woolie is the Chemicals
[3:51:56] <garbageheaphound> MAN I MISS THE CHURCH
[3:51:56] <%AgentOrangeShoes> Can’t escape from crossing determinism
[3:51:56] <Gutsandlove> you better
[3:51:58] <%AncelDeLambert> @Alseid allow me to introduce you to quantum mechanics
[3:51:58] <star_feline> And lots of money Kappa
[3:51:58] <Huntercd> People have will it's just not 'free'
[3:51:58] <%dekkitout> That's the part that he jokes about? Lame...
[3:52:00] <%otakuisaiah> Yeah Pat! Put that Bachelor's of Psychology degree to work!
[3:52:01] <+Grayhammatter> mechanical tomfoolery
[3:52:02] <+Adalore> Study and inflating your own ego to the point to think you can plot these things.
[3:52:03] <%LiquidShake83> chemicals in brain
[3:52:05] <garbageheaphound> AT LEAST THEY GOT FREE WILL
[3:52:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think this guy might be a secular humanist.
[3:52:06] <$realm_forge> And monthly fees
[3:52:06] <+aslfrasle> It's pretty much the anit-life equation
[3:52:07] <+VoytekBus> I'M IN, TAKE MY MON.......oh, you were joking about the sacrifices
[3:52:09] <%BoboDaHobo> determinism is entirely accurate, free will is an illusion created by the human inability to understand every factor all at once.
[3:52:10] <dadeaner> you would have to calculate all variables of the universe to be completely accurate
[3:52:13] <Calamity2007> @Alseid And if it is true than it means that we have no agency in this universe. Horrifying either way
[3:52:18] <ZE_Count> I would leave in live in a kickass hut.
[3:52:21] <%RubberFistFight> @Alseid the universe is demonstrably probabilistic, though. Quantum mechanics is built on probability. That's how it functions. It's baked in.
[3:52:31] <%Jrocy247> This guys face is surreal
[3:52:31] <SvenHolgersson> BURN HARRY POTTER
[3:52:34] <ZE_Count> This Marx book is bad!
[3:52:36] <televisedrevolting> So determinism is basically charting people's behavior?
[3:52:36] <%inkboySP> BOOKBURNING
[3:52:37] <%ape_hawk> i cant stop looking at his mole
[3:52:40] <star_feline> It's gonna me Karl Marx isn't it
[3:52:45] <+Adalore> Das Capital?
[3:52:49] <tigerfang86> BURN THEM BOOKS
[3:52:49] <%miguelrod777> BOOK BURNING
[3:52:56] <%Faustgesicht> Still like him, pat?
[3:52:59] <Vakojin> Burn ideas, gain money.
[3:53:08] <%ThatOneGameTester> @ape_hawk why did you mention it, now i can't stop staring too
[3:53:13] <%inkboySP> The book is Das Kapital
[3:53:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's probably pornography
[3:53:13] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[3:53:13] <TDAWS_MP132> Don't burn the book. BURN THE TOWN
[3:53:20] <+berserkscarlett> I mean, free will exist as long as one persons doesn’t agree with this nonsense
[3:53:22] <@lewdskeletor13> The Vicar is a complicated guy
[3:53:22] <Calamity2007> The poor shouldn't read
[3:53:24] <+Eveningstar2> I'm really enjoying this stream, Pat. Thank you so much for doing this.
[3:53:26] <wookie5358> use the book as fuel to burn the town
[3:53:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's definitely pornography
[3:53:38] <ShoggothLord> @rubberfistfight You may want to look into "probabilistic determinism." What the Vicar described is more like strict, Newtonian determinism, which most folks don't believe in.
[3:53:40] <%ape_hawk> f451 this fucking place
[3:53:42] <ProfBadger> oh yeah, he's definitely going to 'Burn" the book
[3:53:46] <Alseid> Probability is only a way to say "we don't have all the data points". Each cause can only have one consequence, or nothing makes sense
[3:53:51] <dickbuttwoman> Bakunin?
[3:53:59] <%miguelrod777> "burning" books
[3:54:01] <+MrN64> Thisi quest is worth doing, I'll say that much
[3:54:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> He's gonna crank one out to an old philosopher's words
[3:54:06] <tigerfang86> he's doing his best to be wrong
[3:54:10] <tigerfang86> and that's fine honestly
[3:54:11] <InkyDraconian> whomst

[3:54:19] <CapCasual> Bakemono! bronzeRAGE
[3:54:20] <dickbuttwoman> Mikhail Bakunin

[3:54:21] <a_mad_dragon> in before he's a huge liar
[3:54:22] <%Agami23> he thinks what he is doing is good. he is just wrong.
[3:54:22] <Vakojin> Vicar Max, VICARLMARX
[3:54:25] <Louie_Salmon> @shoggothlord Isn't that an oxymoron? Uncertain certainty?
[3:54:28] <%RubberFistFight> @ShoggothLord do you mean "probabilistic causation"? Coz that's a philosophical thing.
[3:54:28] <TDAWS_MP132> now PAY UP OLD MAN
[3:54:28] <misterspotswood> so this game was made by dudes tired of the corporatism of the games industry. fact
[3:54:29] <SvenHolgersson> Pat "Bookburner" Boivin
[3:54:29] <%TIME_PUNCHER> kill them all... except for him
[3:54:30] <dickbuttwoman> "M. Bakuno"
[3:54:30] <deafmutelaughing> ELMO TAIL
[3:54:31] <+Grayhammatter> he's doing his best, to be the wrong
[3:54:32] <%NovaKnightmare> leave it to the preacher man to be the good man in the bad place
[3:54:33] <Calamity2007> Pat supports book burning confirmed
[3:54:35] <Monkeyweed21> GOD WANTS YOU TO BE A CORPORATE SLAVE
[3:54:37] <+berserkscarlett> Hows the game so far?
[3:54:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> Like I said, morally repugnant but not deplorable
[3:54:38] <%Jaxnos> heh
[3:54:38] <+AllenDeadman> the girl who wants the drugs is also trying... or at the very leasy lying her ass off
[3:54:39] <televisedrevolting> At least there's life in his eyes and a will behind his words.
[3:54:43] <%dekkitout> I 'preciate the hustle
[3:54:43] <SubliminaIMessages> so the town is saved?
[3:54:45] <%king_wragles> Wait, I thought he was mostly just pretending to follow his religion?
[3:54:45] <%LiquidShake83> kill though
[3:54:48] <%Run44forrest> some books suck thou
[3:54:51] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat i like this Vicar. much nicer than that screamy amelia bitch
[3:54:51] <%AncelDeLambert> @Alseid we don't have all the data points because it's physically impossible to have all the data points. Uncertainty values are required by the mechanics of the universe.
[3:54:55] <$realm_forge> He also doesn’t seem to have the more rebellious parts of his brain removed
[3:55:00] <Sacksquatch> He's just there to keep people from running out
[3:55:03] <%Dr_Mooose> for now
[3:55:07] <pyroco101> and a dick behind his ass
[3:55:10] <+Adalore> Edgy af with that statement.
[3:55:11] <CapCasual> @AngriestPat Isn't Esther doing it too though?
[3:55:15] <ZE_Count> I wonder if those mushrooms are poisonous?
[3:55:15] <+Matto424> man this town is mega depressing
[3:55:16] <Gorgen> more than i can say tomatoSmile
[3:55:19] <%Animorphimagi> Respec the hustle?
[3:55:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> There is a definite uncanny valley to this game
[3:55:26] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat "Hypocrite that you are, for you trust the chemicals in your brain to tell you they are chemicals. All knowledge is ultimately based on that which cannot prove. Will you fight? Or will you perish like a dog?"
[3:55:35] <+Havictos> Steal ALL the tuna!
[3:55:36] <+Grayhammatter> Taste the FREEDOM
[3:55:40] <%inkboySP> Man, if Edgewater is super depressing, Byzantium is gonna be super infuriating
[3:55:40] <tigerfang86> EXTRA INGREDIENTS rooPog
[3:55:40] <%ape_hawk> the extra cost is CANCER
[3:55:42] <Calamity2007> @Matto424 Why do I have a feeling that this won't even be the most depressing town in the game
[3:55:44] <%Dr_Mooose> eww too much freedom
[3:55:44] <@lewdskeletor13> FREEDOM
[3:55:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> That looks like he's eating a can of cocaine
[3:55:49] <ZE_Count> Yeah that gives me bioshock vibes.
[3:55:49] <Axelbr> @king_wragles No , he just think people in the town can't umderstand the religion because they're braindead
[3:55:49] <The_Gonzales_Experience> PURCHASE YOUR HAPPINESS
[3:55:55] <Brother_Coduss> ....why dose moon mans spacesuit have nipples
[3:55:55] <%RubberFistFight> @AncelDeLambert exactly. Not only that, but like I pointed out before, thanks to chaos theory and the way that thermodynamics works, it's completely impossible to use the current state of a particle to predict where it's going to be after some arbitrarily large interval of time.
[3:55:56] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:55:57] <+3InchMensch> It's a circus of value!
[3:55:59] <Alseid> @AncelDeLambert WE can't have all the datapoints, but the machine that is the universe can, and does. If you do an action with all the exact same variables, the result will always be the same

[3:57:02] <%AncelDeLambert> @Alseid saying that there HAS to be determinism but no I can't prove it isn't very convincing to quite a lot of people. Furthermore, if you can't prove it, and proving it is hugely uncomfortable, why accept it?
[3:57:04] <Mister_McDerp> the poor company has to make a profit somehow

[3:57:10] <%RubberFistFight> @Alseid don't get classical physics and quantum physics confused. The universe operates VERY differently on those two scales, to the point where when they first looked into it, physicists thought their equations were wrong because they didn't make sense.

[3:57:48] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight Y'know what I think? I think fate is dumb. If fate was real, then bad people were always fated to be bad, and that means it wasn't really their fault so you can't blame them. And fuck that. They made a choice.

[3:57:59] <Mister_McDerp> MAX ANXIETY
[3:57:59] <%demegodz> HORROR
[3:57:59] <ShoggothLord> @rubberfistfight No, it's still deterministic in that the consequences of an effect are consistent, but it drops the mind experiment nonsense of "what if WE had all the data points and could tell the future!?" The main thing people neglect to acknowledge about quantum mechanics is that probability and free will aren't the same thing--no choice is being made by a particle when its wavefunction collapses. The result just...happens.

[3:58:17] <+VoytekBus> everyone is equal!
[3:58:18] <%depressed_skeleton> hold hands & poop
[3:58:19] <+TheBinaryEagle> If you make it so people never want to go to the bathroom, they'll have more time to work! Genius!

[3:58:59] <%Rumbutt> EMPLOYER RIGHTS
[3:59:01] <Ner234> PAT NO
[3:59:04] <BeefyQueefer> I imagine the lack of privacy makes employees less likely to take a toilet break on company time.
[3:59:06] <Calamity2007> The worst part about all this is that this isn't too far off than what we have now, especially with the likes of Amazon FeelsBadMan

[3:59:42] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god, please don't tell me this game is the writers thinking they're being deep while ignoring every scrap of fiction and economic philosophy of the last two centuries
[3:59:43] <Calamity2007> What a beta LUL

[3:59:58] <%Dr_Mooose> gotter
[3:59:59] <star_feline> Wow what a CHAD
[4:00:01] <%RubberFistFight> @ShoggothLord but there's numerous experiments that show that, at quantum scales, the outcomes of events are NOT predictable. You can say "the results will be within this sub-set of possibilities" but you can't say WHICH possibility it will be.
[4:00:02] <wookie5358> these are not the droids you are looking for
[4:00:03] <SparkAfterDark> Pat has become the shoplifter
[4:00:04] <wookie5358> move along
[4:00:08] <old_dog_god> Pog when pat finds a bathroom with just one toilet and a working door
[4:00:08] <ZE_Count> revolver!
[4:00:10] <Axelbr> What a chad
[4:00:12] <Calamity2007> Yeah video games!
[4:00:15] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat revolver
[4:00:15] <Vakojin> A revolver !
[4:00:17] <Edible_Enthusiasm> you cant wait till shes gone?
[4:00:18] <dickbuttwoman> Revolver!
[4:00:19] <%ShineTheDiamond> Isn't a lack of privacy a technique used by torturers to demoralize prisoners? Like 'white torture' if I'm remembering right?
[4:00:20] <+Adalore> OHHEY we upgraded npcs out of entering death frenzies if you steal from them
[4:00:21] <Alseid> The funny thing is these are pretty much the Mao Communist Factory conditions, just under Capitalist bureaucracy
[4:00:34] <Calamity2007> @Edible_Enthusiasm He wants to steal now though!
[4:00:37] <+Grayhammatter> wow, that looks exactly like pat
[4:00:38] <Gerik1233> is there a type of Karmic system?
[4:00:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> Spacers Choice doesn;t think of their employees as people. They're their proprty.
[4:00:55] <Calamity2007> @Gerik1233 Maybe a reputation system like New Vegas had
[4:01:00] <old_dog_god> Its me. I am the space cowboy
[4:01:02] <%RubberFistFight> @ShoggothLord and knowing that a certain event will happen "more often than not" is NOT the same thing as accurately predicting that it will happen.
[4:01:04] <Forticon> @Gerik1233 no, more like a reputation system from what i've seen so far
[4:01:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> Definitely a rep system.
[4:01:20] <%dekkitout> Oh- that explains the volcano
[4:01:23] <%CalderGaming> there's your fire source
[4:01:24] <suitangi021> How does the gunplay feel so far?

[4:01:56] <LilMKatsu> Wait, ITS been 4 hours?
[4:02:03] <+Grayhammatter> do you see?
[4:02:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> Melee Weapons are better until you can actually afford ammo.
[4:02:09] <RyanTheRecluse> Watch pat blow up megaton without realising
[4:02:10] <+Havictos> @RubberFistFight Sorry to interrupt I'm just so shocked to see a civil debate on the internet
[4:02:11] <tigerfang86> DEFINITELY dont do it
[4:02:11] <+supaXmugen> im playing it on Xbox Game Pass on PC. it makes you wish this game had VATS
[4:02:11] <+forlorncarton> did you see the dead animals?

[4:02:21] <splugeking> yo
[4:02:27] <Calamity2007> @rumtumtugnutz I imagine low strength builds might have a hard time with this game then
[4:02:27] <LilMKatsu> @ShineTheDiamond dang you are right
[4:02:27] <+hahyeahok> Most streamers i watched left the planet in 3 hours, you haven;t even left this town LUL
[4:02:30] <+Grayhammatter> pat's gonna blow up megaton

[4:02:33] <%Jaxnos> limesSip
[4:02:38] <tigerfang86> Ow
[4:02:39] <ShoggothLord> @rubberfistfight That...doesn't contradict what I said? The core of determinism isn't predestination, it's that free will does not exist and our choices result from the convergence of internal or external forces. The stochastic element of the system doesn't refute that because *randomness is not the same as self-determination.*
[4:02:39] <Marpolo13> lol
[4:02:47] <splugeking> Louis C.K's retarded brother?
[4:02:47] <%Dr_Mooose> just take it out ya baby

[4:03:45] <ProfBadger> oh no
[4:03:46] <star_feline> That's YOUR tuna pat
[4:03:46] <%Stevennapalm> obsidian likes mutated geckos
[4:03:46] <Gorgen> its not fish
[4:03:47] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, turns out not paying people is economically unsound because their productivity goes to shit
[4:03:48] <tigerfang86> godDAMN
[4:03:48] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat this whole place is one big OSHA violation
[4:03:48] <Calamity2007> They are space rats
[4:03:49] <+forlorncarton> are they the Saltuna?
[4:03:49] <Monkeyweed21> they're the saltuna
[4:03:49] <+ThetaFive> I don't think saltuna is fish
[4:03:49] <+supaXmugen> Saltuna is RATS!
[4:03:49] <ShoggothLord> @supaxmugen ...I'm sorry, I honestly don't get the reference. i'm a dumb.
[4:03:50] <ZE_Count> THE TUNA IS A LIE!
[4:03:52] <+Grayhammatter> that isn't even TUNA
[4:03:54] <%ape_hawk> it was never fish
[4:03:55] <+AllenDeadman> THEY'RE SELLING, RAT MEAT, TO PEOPLE
[4:03:56] <+shaderichter_belmont> its a canning factory pat, those things are fish
[4:03:56] <%RubberFistFight> @ShoggothLord wait are we talking actual quantifiable science here are we talking new-age philosophy about the existence of free will and whether your actions are truly yours? Because if it's the latter, quite bluntly, I'm not interested and never have been.
[4:03:58] <%BoboDaHobo> they just appear like dew in the morning.
[4:03:59] <Calamity2007> I'm sure those rats aren't responsible for the plague Kappa
[4:04:02] <Sacksquatch> The meat, it's mutant geckos!
[4:04:05] <+AllenDeadman> RATS THAT PROBABLY HAVE THE PLAGUE
[4:04:07] <+Order_of_Mystery> what do you think saltuna is made of, lol
[4:04:07] <+Estuko> But is it Big Bertha?
[4:04:07] <%miguelrod777> SOYLENT IS RATS
[4:04:09] <+palebluedots> GRINDER
[4:04:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Calamity2007 Far as I can tell your inital stats just give you bigger starting bonuses. You can be completely fine with a low strength melee build. You just won't get the starting bonuses.
[4:04:17] <ZE_Count> PLAGUE RATS BABY
[4:04:18] <%Stevennapalm> don't fist android girls
[4:04:24] <%depressed_skeleton> Define "Machinery"
[4:04:26] <+Adalore> it's on the otherside of the sign
[4:04:26] <%ape_hawk> its to keep you scared
[4:04:28] <The_Gonzales_Experience> DONT FIST ANDROID GIRLS
[4:04:29] <Louie_Salmon> Probably in the employee handbook
[4:04:29] <+Mottyrob> I think everyone's off shift so you can steal whatever now?
[4:04:31] <+KcireX09> BOTTOM LINE
[4:04:35] <KaliasTV> Don't worry about it*
[4:04:35] <arkv01> its real, the only reason they teach you proper operation is they don't lose productivity
[4:04:36] <+VektorTroika> the fine print is rendered in the same color ink as the background
[4:04:39] <%AncelDeLambert> Hey, guys, does this game have the wide range of combat specializations that FONV had?
[4:04:40] <%cha0tic_klutch> Why is Pat replaying the Outer Wilds? 4Head
[4:04:41] <Calamity2007> @rumtumtugnutz I thought you actively got negative perks if you had a starting stat low
[4:04:41] <+supaXmugen> @ShoggothLord Kain from Legacy of Kain. Talks about the lack of free will and all that because hes used time travel so much trying to fix Nosgoth and each its just a little more fucky.
[4:04:44] <$i_am_therydon> the tiniest details say so much.
[4:04:48] <%Dr_Mooose> she's too clean
[4:04:49] <SvenHolgersson> WHATS WITH YOU AND HATS
[4:04:50] <%Jaxnos> who you callin tenderfoot limesD
[4:04:53] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @ShoggothLord I think that ideology was made by people who can't handle the fact that their choices have weight.
[4:04:55] <%Dr_Mooose> don't trust her
[4:04:55] <ShoggothLord> @rubberfistfight Determinism is more a matter of philosophy. It just got into this physics stuff because the space faith man brought it up.
[4:04:56] <%ShineTheDiamond> @AncelDeLambert So far, it looks like
[4:04:58] <+Estuko> @Stevennapalm I'd risk being paralyzed if I got to have 2B use my face her seat. Simple things is what I live for.

[4:05:30] <+Sinetha> FUCK
[4:05:32] <%RubberFistFight> @supaXmugen the funny thing is Kain talks about Destiny being immutable while constantly derailing it. The fact that he's at all surprised when the end of Soul Reaver 2 happens shows that "Destiny" actually doesn't exist.

[4:07:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> naw, don't burn it down.
[4:07:48] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @ShoggothLord lol that they do. I just think that any and all forms of philosophy can't be trusted, as they're all created by people who have a very strong need to justify their own trains of thought.
[4:07:48] <arkv01> BURN the RICH

[4:08:08] <ExtraToastyCheezit> You need a good, clean, solid burn.
[4:08:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> These people are happy and productive. You take away their way of life and they won;t know what to do.
[4:08:08] <%RubberFistFight> @supaXmugen the thing is, it WASN'T orchestrated by the Hylden until at least the second or third timeline revision. That's my point. It's not "Destiny" at all, it's just broken timelines collapsing into their most stable state available.
[4:08:08] <Louie_Salmon> @emptymug No third-person, inventory management, no combo. Yep, he sure would.
[4:08:08] <BallinArbiter> Seize the means of production pat

[4:08:15] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat This is interesting that the first town you go to introduces you to this type of culture/system. It makes me thing what the other places are like.
[4:08:15] <deafmutelaughing> I can't wait until we destroy Spacer's Choice and find the next corporation is 50 times worse
[4:08:15] <AtisutoCurry> this aint it chief
[4:08:16] <beetbo2> Bring help to Spacers
[4:08:19] <+shaderichter_belmont> this is a frontier planet so fuck burning it just kill every fucking member of upper management and every pinkerton they ship in
[4:08:20] <BallinArbiter> Set the workers free

[4:08:40] <%dekkitout> @deafmutelaughing I didn't even consider that! NotLikeThis
[4:08:42] <CrabSlacks> "Don't help anyone, we're in this together" lol
[4:08:45] <xennyvs> "we're all in this together"
[4:08:48] <BallinArbiter> I serve the Soviet yunyun
[4:08:50] <%asurite_warrior> This isnt even good evil corp business this is just some retarded evil corporate feudalism.
[4:08:51] <beetbo2> We’re all in this together
[4:08:53] <beetbo2> Jesus
[4:08:54] <xennyvs> i hope you can shoot some of these execs
[4:08:55] <Parapattern> You burn down the king's castle not the squalid village.
[4:08:56] <+Grayhammatter> yikes
[4:08:58] <garbageheaphound> theres more
[4:08:59] <xennyvs> theres gotta be at least one here
[4:08:59] <%Piemen99> burn it
[4:08:59] <tigerfang86> BURN TO THE GROUND
[4:09:03] <BlindGato> Spacers CHOICE
[4:09:05] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I like how they really show how people buy into believing corpo BS, and even defend it despite how bad it can be.
[4:09:05] <beetbo2> B U R N
[4:09:06] <%Roasted_Pheasant> This is like a WAY more hardcore version of the Crimson Caravan.
[4:09:06] <Mad_Morpho> wait the private division gave him a code even after he exposed his balls in the email?
[4:09:06] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> @AngriestPat So is masturbation a waste of company assets?
[4:09:07] <+ThetaFive> Most of them ALREADY died
[4:09:08] <Marpolo13> but what about the workers?
[4:09:10] <beetbo2> Elmo rise!
[4:09:11] <+Grayhammatter> please burn it
[4:09:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> This is Orwellian at this point.
[4:09:12] <+waltzqueen> Burn castle! not peasants!
[4:09:13] <ZE_Count> Its for a better tomorrow!
[4:09:15] <SvenHolgersson> This feels worse than that debt planet in Warframe
[4:09:15] <+berserkscarlett> This is a heavy NO GO
[4:09:17] <televisedrevolting> How much would Spacer's Choice actually lose if you burned it to the ground? How big is Spacer's Choice? Where is it centralized?

[4:09:22] <beetbo2> Burn it all!!!
[4:09:22] <ShoggothLord> @rubberfistfight Yeah philosophy and physics don't mix in general. That's part of why I don't normally don't philosophize. The core idea of philosophy is good, but its natural trend is to keep nesting itself into deeper and deeper webs of cognitive maundering until the ethos is utterly detached from the real world it's supposed to derive meaning *from.*
[4:09:24] <NeroInfinite> At this point I think they'd welcome death.
[4:09:24] <TDAWS_MP132> Max gets to live
[4:09:24] <Brother_Coduss> they'll die, but be better off in the long run
[4:09:24] <+Adalore> We go burn down the lord's manor.
[4:09:25] <ExtraToastyCheezit> Good Guy Pat slaughtering capital
[4:09:25] <arkv01> pat no you can't just kill them
[4:09:25] <Calamity2007> Their deaths will be a mercy
[4:09:26] <%BoboDaHobo> don't kill them, they can't afford it
[4:09:27] <arkv01> you have to EAT THEM

[4:11:16] <ShoggothLord> @rubberfistfight True. But that was in the days when intellectual pursuits did a lot more cross-polinating. The day of the dilittente man has passed as each field has become more and more complex in its own right.

[4:14:26] <Goldenwolf98> FUCK MAKE HARD CHOICES
[4:14:27] <SubliminaIMessages> HE DOESNT HAVE A CHOICE PAT
[4:14:27] <%mh9s> so he'll push them slightly less hard...to meet their production targets
[4:14:28] <+waltzqueen> It's not him! It's the people who own the company
[4:14:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Remember this guy belongs to Spacer's Choice too.
[4:14:29] <+rdark_ksu> why I pretend to have a soul every day?
[4:14:29] <$i_am_therydon> elmo is confused
[4:14:29] <Marpolo13> because now Pat is getting second thoughts about genocide
[4:14:30] <TDAWS_MP132> IT MIGHT BE A LIE

[4:14:33] <%NovaKnightmare> Even the most scummy of scum are still human
[4:14:34] <SGrim> @AngriestPat the help he needs is to put a bullet in his brain.
[4:14:35] <%marsanta> He's holding them back
[4:14:35] <Brandon__Brando> Thats good writing
[4:14:36] <Hydrapissed> 3rd one be loose
[4:14:36] <+AllenDeadman> double cross him
[4:14:36] <ZE_Count> meet the other person first!
[4:14:36] <SvenHolgersson> MAN IS NOT EVIL
[4:14:36] <dickbuttwoman> TRUE EVIL IS THE BANALITY OF IT
[4:14:37] <Gutsandlove> wait aminute
[4:14:37] <%RupanSen> "I don't like grey, give me black and white"
[4:14:37] <arkv01> he didn't, its the sociopath ruse
[4:14:37] <Hydrapissed> hes loose
[4:14:37] <%MrBorisMakarov> LOOK AT THIS ASSHOLE
[4:14:38] <NeroInfinite> Not everything is black and white @AngriestPat
[4:14:38] <$Remery_> That's just a buisness talking business to an outsider
[4:14:38] <+MrMcCrabby> Don't belive his lies
[4:14:38] <$zackalan> Just means he has a soul that will burn in hell
[4:14:39] <+PapaGravestone> has this been fun to watch?
[4:14:39] <+OkamiDude15> its the facade of a soul to keep up appearances sfhTHINK
[4:14:40] <tigerfang86> he's SUPER EVIL
[4:14:40] <%depressed_skeleton> Sell soul for Money?
[4:14:41] <+xBolts4Lifex> Bring them back. No ubi on this space rock.
[4:14:41] <CrypticMochi> He’s good at this, he needs to die
[4:14:41] <Onamar> If he doesn't do it the whole town is fucked, rock and a hard place
[4:14:41] <star_feline> Pat if you don't help THE WHOLE TOWN IS FUCKED
[4:14:41] <+twohitgood> he didn't have a soul. he sees it as a failing in efficiency and admitting it to you will get you to get his slaves back to him.
[4:14:41] <Caidezes> HE'S A HERO PAT
[4:14:42] <televisedrevolting> He at least admitted they were being worked too hard...
[4:14:42] <garbageheaphound> I dont think he got a chouce

[4:14:44] <IminyourBase> IF THEY SHUT DOWN THE TOWN WHERE WILL THE PEOPLE GO?!?!
[4:14:44] <%ShineTheDiamond> Wait, they/ll be fired for deserting their jobs. They won't get to live in the city or come back
[4:14:44] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat well it's the mundanity of evil, innit. It's easier to call someone "pure evil" when you don't see them as human :P
[4:14:44] <+hahyeahok> Oh yeah this game will do that to you
[4:14:45] <wookie5358> you need a soul to manipulate properly @AngriestPat
[4:14:46] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> This is why the writing is so good in this game.
[4:14:46] <rubbishbinge> HE WON'T HAVE A SOUL IF YOU SHOOT HIS BUTT OFF
[4:14:46] <+Order_of_Mystery> is this... gray morality?
[4:14:47] <Calamity2007> Three dimensional characters
[4:14:47] <Mad_Morpho> this game ain't blck and white
[4:14:49] <ShoggothLord> BETRAY THIS CAPITALIST
[4:14:49] <TyrantBelial> He's the guy who deals with the HIGHER higher ups.
[4:14:49] <+vicar_anat> BURN IT DOWN!
[4:14:49] <misterspotswood> and this is where the game branches to you being a company man or a labor union leader
[4:14:51] <Jolly_Adventurer> HE'S HOLDING BACK THE COMPANY
[4:14:51] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> They word is grey Pat
[4:14:53] <braincraft> Yeah, it sucked that I was making them kill themselves for my bottom line. But you should totally sabotage their only other option so they'll have to come back and kill themselves for me again.
[4:14:54] <+KingGoblodyte> LOOK AT ELMO
[4:14:55] <%ape_hawk> PFFFFFFFFFFT
[4:14:55] <daisyyyy> Hes a smart boss but hes still a fucking boss
[4:14:55] <BallinArbiter> Stay the course pat
[4:14:56] <metalwater8> He’s a real hero pat
[4:14:57] <RyanTheRecluse> Remember, most of these people care about the company they belong to
[4:14:57] <%ape_hawk> BULLSHIT
[4:14:58] <deafmutelaughing> """amends"""
[4:14:58] <%Rumbutt> LIAR
[4:14:59] <+waltzqueen> LIES
[4:15:01] <%dekkitout> How deep does this corporate-exploitation-tithe-rabbit hole go ?
[4:15:01] <%asurite_warrior> Not gives more doubt that an admission of blame.
[4:15:01] <tigerfang86> YEAH OK
[4:15:02] <+forlorncarton> He's believes the company line, but also wants to help the workers...
[4:15:02] <TyrantBelial> He still gotta do what the shareholders want
[4:15:02] <Hydrapissed> THE FOLD!
[4:15:03] <%honeyman18> ARE THEY KIDS?

[4:15:20] <Louie_Salmon> God damnit this is somewhat reasonable
[4:15:21] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HR MAKES YOU THINK THEY HAVE A SOUL, THATS HOW THEY GET YOU
[4:15:21] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Remember he's just the middleman between company and town, he might be at the top, but he still lives here.
[4:15:22] <stormhawk9891> I don't believe him. SHOOT HIM
[4:15:23] <%CalderGaming> @AngriestPat he genuinely, honestly, sincerely.... wants to perpetuate the miserable lives this town of slaves live

[4:29:01] <%honeyman18> it's a vulkan religion
[4:29:05] <+twohitgood> his left ear has the same transparency as silas did outside....is everyone lit the same?
[4:29:06] <IminyourBase> DO YOU STILL LIKE HIM?!?!
[4:29:10] <dickbuttwoman> The book he's looking for is an anarchist book
[4:29:11] <%GarbageNirvana> Get a load of THIS society
[4:29:12] <+Rodzzila> "I will rob you of all your possessions, but help me god if I ever lie!"
[4:29:24] <%RubberFistFight> @Brizzo24 tell her to pound sand, you're an adult, you can play what you want.
[4:29:25] <+AllenDeadman> okay so.... we should meet the other faction, if they're somehow even more shitty...
[4:29:26] <arkv01> live long and work hard
[4:29:36] <Serge_12> Pat, how is the game so far?

[4:29:41] <+Havictos> @AngriestPat These are people who truly believe in the idea of the benevolent corporation.
[4:29:42] <GemNinja> @AngriestPat how's the gunplay
[4:29:44] <+twohitgood> is dialog a different lighting than the regular room?
[4:29:54] <Brizzo24> @rubberfistfight true but I want my dick sucked

[4:30:11] <%dekkitout> Vati, what did you do!?
[4:30:12] <+maku_tree> Why did he make his character look so fucked up? Kappa

[4:30:17] <wizzerobe93> @AngriestPat I just joined, is the writing as good as NV?
[4:30:18] <+twohitgood> @Run44forrest but his ear was transparent like it was backlit, not lit from the front.
[4:30:19] <@lewdskeletor13> God this game is great
[4:30:23] <%RubberFistFight> @Brizzo24 so find a girl who will do that and also NOT dictate your behaviour to you. I guarantee you if you tried to tell her she wasn't allowed to play/watch something she'd lose her mind.
[4:30:25] <northsouthmiddledakota> Pat people made Vinny play DMC 2 for vharity, poor guy
[4:30:27] <@lewdskeletor13> I’m glad the companions actually EXIST
[4:30:30] <Solidus_113> remember to sell junk too
[4:30:33] <arkv01> reminder once the boomers are dead things will get better hopefully
[4:30:36] <GemNinja> I hate that, i'll bring up some shit but damn if I'll actually talk about it
[4:30:37] <+OkamiDude15> that second option made me feel real bad
[4:30:46] <%EmptyMug> @wizzerobe93 Better so far
[4:30:48] <Brandon__Brando> @wizzerobe93 from what I've seen yes
[4:30:51] <%ape_hawk> this one town is more interesting and thought-out than all the rpgs bethesda made since fallout 3
[4:30:55] <Vakojin> Stuff to sale.
[4:30:59] <+Adalore> ...I dunno if chunk means it is INTENDED to be sold or not.
[4:30:59] <%BoboDaHobo> @rubberfistfight i don't think you know what girlfriend aggro means
[4:31:03] <Louie_Salmon> But what if being dressed like a miner worker could be useful for dialogue?
[4:31:09] <+Adalore> Oh there is a hotkey for "Sell junk"
[4:31:10] <Brizzo24> @rubberfistfight imagine telling your gf twitch chat told you to Break up lol
[4:31:10] <NeroInfinite> supplies for crafting
[4:31:10] <Serge_12> how do you like the game so far Pat?
[4:31:12] <Calamity2007> How generous is the carry limit in this game?
[4:31:15] <Solidus_113> Hold X to Sell Junk
[4:31:15] <+Adalore> It is actually probably JUST for money
[4:31:16] <wizzerobe93> Nice, I was worried if this game was going to hold up or not
[4:31:21] <$DarkKnightGrave> GivePLZ I just want to give her a hug.
[4:31:26] <+AllenDeadman> I'd keep them just in case
[4:31:30] <%RubberFistFight> @Brizzo24 imagine having so little self respect that a thing like "gf aggro" is normal to you.
[4:31:31] <NeroInfinite> but yeah that was just junk
[4:31:31] <Nekros4442> its actually just junk, it's sellables
[4:31:33] <+AllenDeadman> you're not getting much anyways
[4:31:42] <+gutlesscoward> oh wow, you can mark items as junk too
[4:31:46] <%ape_hawk> you mean pillars one and two?
[4:31:51] <SomeOtherNeb> oh get ready for this, this shit's FUCKED

[4:36:00] <%RubberFistFight> @BoboDaHobo again, that's not what GF aggro means. Unless you think she's currently fucking him while he types in stream chat?
[4:36:00] <%MelBrooksKA> @Deekman Because PatRick and ElMorty
[4:36:02] <wholewheat420> @RubberFistFight just say you hate girls and move on mate. I say i've got husband aggro all the time and it never means i'm not ALLOWED to do something lmao. It was just a phrase, lets leave it alone.

[4:36:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat has been playing this game for 4 hours and is less than an hour into the story. I'd say that bodes pretty fucking well.
[4:36:59] <%honeyman18> What's the time on this town's quest line so far?
[4:37:05] <%EmptyMug> It's available through the Microsoft store and Microsoft Game Pass on PC though

[4:37:51] <%king_wragles> @ShineTheDiamond that sounds tasty, but it's probably tuna flavored salt
[4:37:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think
[4:37:52] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AJ_Cherenkov Or Salmon Tuna
[4:37:53] <CrypticMochi> Did I miss aggro having it’s meaning changed or something?
[4:37:56] <%ShineTheDiamond> @AJ_Cherenkov That's what I thought until the pic showing a very salmon like head on that fish
[4:37:57] <arkv01> this guy is a starcraft NPC

[4:47:08] <%RubberFistFight> Jeremy spoke in class today
[4:47:10] <Brother_Coduss> @King_Wolf_Rigger it's on that game pass thing right? dont you have to have a subscription for that?
[4:47:11] <AMERICA_YEA> and you missed it @Hydrapissed
[4:47:13] <%TONYOO101> !outerworlds
[4:47:13] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[4:47:14] <LilMKatsu> wait what
[4:47:15] <%CalderGaming> @AngriestPat do you have this game on an SSD?
[4:47:17] <SvenHolgersson> jesus dude
[4:47:18] <arkv01> yes, we did the dark deeed
[4:47:18] <%XeroSigmaPrime> IS THIS WHEN OBSIDIAN IS ARMED WITH AN EGINE OUTSIDE OF BETHESDA'S?!
[4:47:19] <Ner234> Sure did

[4:47:34] <mayorrev> he sounds so familiar
[4:47:35] <$WETBUTTDISEASE> EMLO

[4:47:39] <%ShineTheDiamond> @Brother_Coduss I would suggest Minecraft if you have a limited budget. The modding community is MASSIVE so you can always change the game into something new.

[4:48:09] <SvenHolgersson> whutta dumshit
[4:48:11] <Edible_Enthusiasm> poop murder
[4:48:11] <dickbuttwoman> Pat knows that. Pat WISHES for that life.
[4:48:12] <%honeyman18> What about the POOP BOTS?
[4:48:13] <%ShineTheDiamond> @Brother_Coduss I would also suggest playing older abandonware games. A lot are still really fun and are free
[4:48:14] <Vakojin> It's gonna be a fucking nuke.
[4:48:19] <%TheMattman1313> Unless they're trying to catch us organics AT OUR MOST VULNERABLE

[4:48:31] <+ZenVulgarity> Yes
[4:48:33] <+AllenDeadman> should we go talk to the grave digger?
[4:48:39] <+ZenVulgarity> I just did that Pat
[4:48:41] <Caidezes> Yes.
[4:48:42] <%RubberFistFight> @ShineTheDiamond shit yeah, there's tons of awesome shit from the DOS era on repositories and stuff
[4:49:00] <CurrySauseBandit> Absolutely sure there's piss on that.
[4:49:02] <%Run44forrest> inspect it
[4:49:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @ShineTheDiamond Most abondonware doesn't work on newer rigs though, at least not for me.

[4:49:28] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat the bundles sealed, you need to take it to him to open it
[4:49:36] <GemNinja> the clouds look weird
[4:49:39] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger DOSbox is an option, requires a bit of setup but you can rig it to run properly on modern rigs.

[4:49:46] <%ShineTheDiamond> @King_Wolf_Rigger Hmm. I'm guessing they need older OS?

[4:50:23] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight @Havictos That's what I've heard, but I have the problems that Pat's talked about where most of the time it just doesn't work.

[4:50:33] <%RubberFistFight> @ShineTheDiamond nah a lot of older games had their speed directly tied to the processor frequency. Meaning on today's systems, even if you could run them natively, they would be insanely fast and impossible to play.

[4:52:38] <kylejefferies> @angriestpat What color would you call this game so far?
[4:52:44] <todcomod> Holy shit it looks just like Pat
[4:52:44] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @grayjammer Please don't waste a good Monster on a dead Pat.
[4:52:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> I dunno what's weird about it, the models are reacting to the light source on the level.
[4:52:48] <lardosgames> enjoying the game so far?
[4:52:49] <+forlorncarton> mod
[4:52:53] <SvenHolgersson> Its been awhile since I saw your character Pat and ITS LITERALLY JUST YOU
[4:52:53] <%RubberFistFight> @ShineTheDiamond there was actually a period where the majority of software packages had to be redesigned from the ground up for the same reason. A lot of them tied their number-crunching stuff to the processor the same way, which meant when things changed and Pentium launched, everything just fucking broke.
[4:52:57] <SvenHolgersson> IM BLOWN AWAY
[4:52:58] <RDMOOSE> Is the game good from what youv'e palyed so far?
[4:53:02] <Monkeyweed21> orange
[4:53:02] <AMERICA_YEA> this game looks so sick
[4:53:02] <%EmptyMug> HDR
[4:53:05] <NeroInfinite> very saturated
[4:53:09] <+Adalore> Has colortheory in effect

[4:53:16] <+drawdehellfire> @AngriestPat My girlfriend told me I have a "vacuous smile". Can you tell me what the fuck that's supposed to mean?

[4:53:19] <%ShineTheDiamond> @RubberFistFight Makes sense.

[4:53:20] <+ZephynM> I might just have to get this game with the game pass.
[4:53:21] <krymzen5> its very good
[4:53:21] <%manmountain11> manmountain11 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:53:31] <NeroInfinite> I love the NPC interaction
[4:53:38] <%Aeoneth> @drawdehellfire vacuous means empty
[4:53:43] <%InugamiTheHound> far cry new dawn, rage 2 and now outer worlds all have color
[4:53:45] <redsynod> soulless
[4:53:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @rumtumtugnutz The light coming through the ear the way it does, would makes sense if someone were shining a flashlight through their ear. Otherwise, it's a bit too much.
[4:53:48] <+Havictos> It's like they actually matter
[4:53:49] <%Eveningstar2> Hey Pat, try wearing marauder gear and talk to Abernathy, the sick guy in his house.
[4:53:55] <SvenHolgersson> I hope there's space elevators that was a highlight in ME
[4:53:57] <+Forente> I am super into it
[4:53:59] <kylejefferies> @zephynm If you have gamepass you can install it right now.
[4:54:11] <+drawdehellfire> @Aeoneth But I have teeth
[4:54:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Just booted this up on my PS4 Pro, doesn't seem like it has HDR settings
[4:54:13] <+AllenDeadman> I am angry there is no romance
[4:54:14] <%Run44forrest> paaat
[4:54:20] <AMERICA_YEA> this amount of dialog reminds me of the entire response dialog rewrite just for extremely stupid characters from Arcanum
[4:54:21] <%dekkitout> "Fuck you, pay me!"
[4:54:21] <KishinGrek> Best fallout spiritual succesor
[4:54:22] <+ZephynM> @kylejefferies Not yet, sadly. Mine expired last month and I haven't renewed it yet.
[4:54:28] <arkv01> yeah how about a quickie silas
[4:54:30] <42nfl19> This game is dirty and grimy yet colorful.
[4:54:42] <%Eveningstar2> Silas's voice actor is Sekiro.
[4:54:43] <%Aeoneth> @drawdehellfire probably means there's no true emotions behind it
[4:54:45] <+ZephynM> @kylejefferies I've been bouncing between Code Vein and Sekiro and the occasional depression where I kinda just stare at a blank wall
[4:54:46] <SvenHolgersson> OMG
[4:54:48] <%RubberFistFight> @drawdehellfire a "vacuous smile" is a specific kind of expression, it's kind of a stiff face with a slack, slightly open jaw. Sort of an expression of bemused shock, but held for a lot longer.
[4:54:50] <+Estuko> WTF
[4:54:53] <PunishedMercer_> @drawdehellfire having or showing a lack of thought or intelligence; mindless. "a vacuous smile" - from google
[4:54:54] <%dekkitout> Seems legit
[4:54:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound Yo! have you seen the anime No Guns Life? It's pretty wicked.
[4:54:56] <%Run44forrest> damnit pat you snitched
[4:55:00] <SGrim> That's incredible
[4:55:02] <+Order_of_Mystery> you snitch

[4:55:17] <daisyyyy> Pat why do you keep snitching
[4:55:20] <Ner234> Pat "SnitchLord" Boivin
[4:55:25] <redsynod> very on brand for pat to sell out
[4:55:26] <kylejefferies> CrossCode?
[4:55:27] <%CalderGaming> on the nose again
[4:55:40] <%InugamiTheHound> @King_Wolf_Rigger no I have not seen no guns life. I need to watch more anime
[4:55:51] <KishinGrek> This Looks great, like fallout 1 dialogue and animated npcs
[4:55:51] <+ZephynM> @kylejefferies Top-down action game, pixel art done in HTML5 and its very good. The story is awesome, I hear its Zelda-like because puzzles and action
[4:55:51] <%depressed_skeleton> you wanna fight??
[4:56:00] <damienlunas> He's a snitch, kill him
[4:56:01] <%Dr_Mooose> do something about it then Silas
[4:56:12] <+ZephynM> @kylejefferies It's $20 on Steam I think, also on consoles I believe
[4:56:25] <+DaniSaintDani> Is it always twilight in this?
[4:56:37] <%depressed_skeleton> hmmmmmmmm
[4:56:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound It's definitely a good watch. Cyborg with a gun for a head works as a private investigator of sorts.
[4:56:42] <kylejefferies> @zephynm Sounds like something I would play if I had a PC of any kind. and no, only PC.
[4:56:45] <%CalderGaming> JESUS

[4:57:22] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound Legally, or "legally"? lol
[4:57:26] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat My guess. Hope took to long to get here. Corporate doesn't want a big ass ship full of un-brainwashed colonists showing up and rocking the boat
[4:57:34] <Ner234> I love the fact that it is straight up called "Botched" LUL
[4:57:52] <%demegodz> oh

[4:58:08] <Caidezes> This twon's so cheerful.
[4:58:09] <FizzWMG> this game looks so good

[4:59:43] <BeefyQueefer> are those the blue ape creatures from that film Evolution back from 2001-ish?
[4:59:47] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound I mean, it's not YOUR fault it's not available where you are, and if they really wanted the money, they would've made it available. Right?
[4:59:47] <+dieselssb> nice
[4:59:48] <%demegodz> nice
[4:59:51] <%Run44forrest> oh it died? i thought it froze

[5:01:08] <Brother_Coduss> See, one of the things holding me back from picking this up is it isnt an actual openworld game
[5:01:18] <KishinGrek> Any good shotguns yet?
[5:01:31] <%KingVantq> found a grenade launcher in one of the houses by the landing pad
[5:01:31] <%MalekDracarus> Its on the lookout bandit
[5:01:37] <+RealThiele> bad dog
[5:01:39] <%GarbageNirvana> @Brother_Coduss Funny, I see that as a perk because it's not filled with vast expanses of fuck-all
[5:01:44] <%Mendin> the tables have turned humman
[5:01:47] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound When you finish Demon Slayer, keep in mind they confirmed a movie that will take over where the show leaves off so you'll have hope for it not just ending.

[5:03:03] <%Faustgesicht> That's a nice gun
[5:03:04] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound I was stoked to hear it, cuz I was so worried it wasn't gonna keep going. Glad it was popular enough to keep going.
