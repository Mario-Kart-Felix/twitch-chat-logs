[0:04:01] <$Valdorick> Its why we need to do a bug war, a war against bugs - they don't have skeletons inside them.
[0:04:03] <%Aztec50> Aztec50 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:04:12] <Mr_pwng3> but their skeletons are on the outside
[0:04:23] <Mr_pwng3> what you want to really fight is the jellyfish
[0:04:24] <+CanonHusbando> bugs have skeletons on the outside and honestly, agree
[0:04:24] <%CJett92> endoskeletons v exoskeletons
[0:04:31] <%oddslogic> oddslogic subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 29 month streak!

[0:04:51] <xmetalicdemonx> hello everybody.
[0:04:56] <%domokun124> do all insects have exo skeletons?
[0:04:57] <$Valdorick> You're right, we should kill the Jelly Fish, then turn on the bugs.
[0:05:08] <Tennochief> No way, jelly fish are cool
[0:05:10] <%spiritofmojave> RAT TIME jermaChomp
[0:05:14] <worldbrand> @domokun124 not only do all insects, all arthropods have exoskeletons and molt
[0:05:18] <+CanonHusbando> having an exoskeleton is a prerequisite for being an insect yes
[0:05:19] <nicoleymcquack> Yooo I haven't been able to watch a live pat stream for sooo long because of finals!!!

[0:05:35] <Mr_pwng3> my professor says its unreasonable to kill every bug in the planet, but i think whatever the effect is still better then a world where bugs exist

[0:21:35] <+BubbaRands> Jesus got murked 33 when he died for the sins of you and me
[0:21:36] <dekkitout> Then he took 3 days to respawn like a scrub
[0:21:38] <mohopsoul> when did jesus lose his virginity
[0:21:40] <@lewdskeletor13> Jesus got Merc’d like a binch
[0:21:40] <+garbocardboardington> That’s when Jesus got mad spanked dawg
[0:21:41] <%ECRead> odd way to phrase, but yes

[0:30:49] <Mr_pwng3> does crazy talk work if pat says something in french?
[0:30:50] <$nitronLVIII> Pat you should just tag this stream as bilingual so you can get the big french view count
[0:30:50] <$RaikenTB> 45 USD seems a little high for this.
[0:30:53] <nicoleymcquack> i did french in school for four years and i cant speak it for shit
[0:30:54] <dekkitout> I got Outer Wilds instead...

[0:34:19] <Tennochief> LUL
[0:34:20] <%SWFanatic> the internet told me and only me

[0:34:59] <nobody12349> Pat WAS THERE when she was recording
[0:35:06] <gustavozxd> the amount of rats that can kill a person in this game is very small
[0:35:08] <+garbocardboardington> You chose the wrong house foo’
[0:35:18] <rufus2k2> lob then burn
[0:35:18] <aimlesshealer> Pat was the microphone
[0:35:19] <collindoucet99> Has Hugo done the cool stuff yet?
[0:35:20] <derap41> Really this game is just the most complicated "the floors lava" game ever made
[0:35:21] <%spiritofmojave> Pat actually edited that video to make it intended for him
[0:35:24] <%ElenaManetta> HAHAHAHA
[0:35:24] <Tennochief> 4
[0:35:24] <worldbrand> it only takes one rat to kill a person, given sufficient velocity

[0:51:20] <NeroInfinite> You're full up
[0:51:22] <Dr_Mooose> good shadows
[0:51:25] <+CanonHusbando> there are items outside too
[0:51:25] <+TomServal> @bread_assassin Well the plague is involved.
[0:51:26] <Shwepie> My goblins want me to try and push all the rats into a corner and force them to poof into smoke. Every, single, one.
[0:51:28] <+CanonHusbando> and in the corner
[0:51:30] <Tennochief> Hey fucko bois
[0:51:33] <%nyurgh> it cant be the kid, amicia can get eaten
[0:51:35] <Mr_pwng3> keep calm skeleton
[0:51:36] <dekkitout> Fun Fasle Fact: Rats strongly dislike the taste of O+ blood
[0:51:38] <nicoleymcquack> the kid is just a smaller ratnado in human skin
[0:51:43] <%Gogogolem> Avdol would have no problem in this ratpocalypse.
[0:51:46] <Yadogari> There was an item outside to the left
[0:51:47] <Tennochief> Episanguinius
[0:51:48] <$Valdorick> I mean, the blatant answer, as someone who hasn't played this game and has no idea were its going, is that your filthy witch of a mother had rat voodoo, and that servant is covered in anti-rat herbs.
[0:51:53] <KaseKaizer> stripRat
[0:51:55] <Tennochief> favored Primarch of the Skaven

[0:51:57] <gustavozxd> oh no
[0:51:58] <%tigerfang86> they used all the soldier bodies to make this rat hive
[0:51:59] <%ElenaManetta> I'm really amazed some none triple A company was able to do this big cluster tech and NOT have the game stutter to shit
[0:51:59] <%tigerfang86> probably

[0:52:29] <reonome> its magic rat poop
[0:52:30] <%tigerfang86> TENDRILS
[0:52:31] <%ares92822> Mom was an English witch that got freaky with satan
[0:52:32] <+twohitgood> hugo didn't like you, clearly.
[0:52:32] <%windsoc> maybe they are friends to ratkind
[0:52:35] <+dirtsniffurperson> aliens
[0:52:36] <Heyestus> @AngriestPat Don't expect it to ever be explained.

[0:52:46] <%Cinebeast> it's like magic green fire rat poop
[0:52:47] <%mayorrev> So are these rats an entity or being mind controlled or what @AngriestPat
[0:52:47] <alrobot2014> how much rat poop habe you seen at once
[0:52:49] <gustavozxd> maybe they were able to craft some crazy defensive rat magic
[0:52:51] <%arancet> these rats must have some baaad diseases
[0:52:52] <Mr_Strut> They have a LOT of fiber in their diet
[0:52:53] <$caliginouscalico> That’s cause you a Quebec boy
[0:52:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat they build their nests out of shit like that
[0:52:53] <Cdjgamer> tendrils it must be death stranding
[0:52:53] <+iamacegaming> Is this the end of the game?
[0:52:54] <Shwepie> @AngriestPat That shit is nesting material... you'll find out what it is made of later.
[0:52:54] <%SaltyDongs> red skull

[0:52:57] <%SWFanatic> i hate it when poop tendrils
[0:52:58] <+CanonHusbando> rats poop in pellets
[0:52:59] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Those pople all at rat poison before they died.
[0:53:01] <captainnathaniel> @AngriestPat amicia says in the start of the game they barely talk, and she haven't seen him for months
[0:53:07] <+SuzakuRising> I'm thinking they didn't eat the peoe that were already dead. the inquisition soldiers killed them all at the beginning of the game.
[0:53:07] <+Javaa01> I mean, it's obvious they're using corpses as structure reinforcements, on account of all the ribcages
[0:53:08] <emillionghost> i like the different climbing animations
[0:53:08] <rufus2k2> lol, the devs worked on and won an award for a Ratatouille game, ain't that some shit

As such the Church just started to give dudes Priesthood and that led to the later issues

[3:03:33] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat An average rat will eat approximately 5% of it's body weight per day. The sheer volume of "food" / calories these rats need to consume is super nuts.
[3:03:34] <%DavidSanChan> play the prequel to this game afterwards, bad rats
[3:03:37] <GrampsGrubberfly> crazy that this game is 100% historically accurate and this is exactly what happened

[3:06:13] <+BoomerTiro> This is to complete his training

[3:06:16] <ShichiNoBushi> *Hugo
[3:06:17] <+shaderichter_belmont> just yeet the cure at hugo
[3:06:17] <+Tolvan> this is brainwashing
[3:06:18] <ooblag> It's to make him cross the threshhold or whatever
[3:06:18] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat it's the last thing he cares about
[3:06:19] <%theAncopro> can't beat the shit out of you without getting closer
[3:06:19] <+MagickBurritoh> ITS THE SHARINGAN
[3:06:19] <kirijotakeharu> Hugo has to awaken his mangekyo sharingan
[3:06:21] <GoldeNOVA> STAB HIM

[3:06:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's to awaken the true power of the RAT KING
[3:06:27] <collindoucet99> He’s a child
[3:06:28] <+DesertOfSand> His LOVE for her is probably the last thing blocking the threshold
[3:06:28] <CassyASG> omg a fuckngi anime power up
[3:06:28] <Prism_Wing> Gotta unlock the Mangekyo Ratiggan
[3:06:31] <%weissguard> She's probably the last "restraint".
