[0:48:36] <+CaptainPyron> @PatStaresAt Left on Dpad I think.
[0:48:38] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt lining up the pick axe swing with the circle gives more mats
[0:48:38] <Soulsbjorne> it also looks nice. Which i hate and resent
[0:48:38] <Draco_Renegade> Does this game have a story?
[0:48:38] <itIsJustMat> left on dpad like the prompt says?
[0:48:39] <%Dunmarkh> dpad like on the screen
[0:48:39] <%Broand> yeah and then the kids play other games, say it's not as good as fortnite, and go right back
[0:48:40] <%californaya> I don't think it matters
[0:48:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> maybe read the prompts ya dingus
[0:48:41] <herotony04> Yes the kids feel smooth pat
[0:48:44] <+Scevda> Same looks and feels
[0:48:45] <%Keaton_x> I agree. I hate the shit out of the game, but it's a really solid shooter
[0:48:46] <%real_life_ghost> pat, if you win you won't be able to make sandwiches any more.
[0:48:46] <+OrangeMDT> The kids make it feel good?
[0:48:47] <fkellington> Fuck them kids, they deserve it
[0:48:48] <Turf_Wind_and_Fire> Material depends on what you collect
[0:48:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> remember when Fortnite was a tower defense game and the battle royale was just an add-on free play mode?
[0:48:53] <generalve> @PatStaresAt i think its L2
[0:48:54] <red_fox_zero> It feels good? It doesn't look like it would for some reason.

[0:49:48] <generalve> @PatStaresAt i dont know if you know this but they added a crafting mechanic for this season.
[0:49:49] <CloniiCory> NO
[0:49:51] <$villagepixel64> the Primal was better. its a burst fire drum shotgun
[0:49:56] <Quite_Dapper> no it's worse but because it's blue you can craft it into a purple
[0:49:56] <gogoatman> Makeshift is worse
[0:49:58] <ape_hawk> is this the timeline where reverse flash won?
[0:49:58] <jorniev> PLAYERS?
[0:49:58] <+LokimenD> Pat has finally sold out
[0:50:02] <DianaTheAscian> I assume shot guns are still king in this game
[0:50:08] <sweet_gravy> has he ever played this game before
[0:50:13] <TrollKing96> I'm more interested in the Save The World part of this game than the BR portion.
[0:50:15] <%bravebravesrobin> bravebravesrobin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Oh yeah, two month celebration with a Fortnite shit show; my chubby is now complete

[0:50:24] <%Agami23> this isnt selling out, selling out is what pat did with adios
[0:50:35] <pokefan9956> how do you do fellow kids
[0:50:38] <+Promessa_EX> does building with metal still suck?
[0:50:39] <arkv01> pat what you're feeling is basically when furry porn is stupidly good but you hate it
[0:50:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL

[0:51:10] <Ipsenscastle> well there's a metaphor for the game
[0:51:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @arkv01 Lol why did you have to remind me that Furry porn exists
[0:51:11] <CloniiCory> Pat sold out when they did ads for The Inhumans on the podcast that one time.
[0:51:11] <ape_hawk> just stay in the trash for the rest of the game
[0:51:12] <%real_life_ghost> this is pat sending a picture of him fucking his new lover to raid shadow legends.
[0:51:14] <balthazar758> right where you belong

[0:51:16] <OneThousandTomatoes> that's woolies thing pat
[0:51:20] <%YakumoYomi> @TrollKing96 Didn't they essentially abandon Save the World once the BR portion became a mega-hit?

[0:51:56] <+AnthonyJMax> throw it at your feet
[0:51:57] <LunarRemix> @YakumoYomi It was kind of half abandoned even before the BR came out, the BR was just the final nail in it's coffin
[0:51:58] <%Dunmarkh> @wmeldrum technically yes
[0:51:58] <+Scevda> Your safe in your home now
[0:52:01] <jorniev> @HimakiLuvsU KONAMI
[0:52:02] <Ipsenscastle> PUBG seemed way more exciting than this
[0:52:04] <$villagepixel64> @wmeldrum there was but it's not being updated anymore
[0:52:08] <%asgard147> Sounds great
[0:52:11] <Quite_Dapper> @PatStaresAt My biggest tip for you right now is to STOP GOING AROUND THINGS and instead BREAKTHEM WITH THE AXE
[0:52:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> Third person sucks
[0:52:14] <yourliteraldog> The art style is good
[0:52:16] <Aydarkzero> @HimakiLuvsU i think you mean Konami cause Kojima has nothing to do with Metal gear at all
[0:52:17] <vapidq> @HollowBeansVG hiding inside a garbage bin singlehandedly made you not want to play it? i'm hoping you're exaggerating
[0:52:18] <+wmeldrum> @villagepixel64 is it good?
[0:52:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> an epic gamer has been here
[0:52:21] <+Stormiercashew> yeah mom i definetly need a 3080 to play fortnite

[0:52:56] <+deepvoid42> DUMMY NOOO
[0:52:56] <Xhog1> This game would be slightly better if it didn't have building. You have to be an insane rapid builder to stand a chance now.
[0:52:58] <ape_hawk> kill your tutorial!!
[0:52:58] <+FishyLamar1> D: Wtf

[0:53:22] <+archangel9889> whats the deal with the triggers?
[0:53:22] <+CelioHogane> @Xhog1 nah, actually, nowadays building is not that important.
[0:53:22] <arkv01> yeah we DEMAND Chun Li's CHEEKS
[0:53:25] <gogoatman> You need more weapons
[0:53:25] <SQDizzy> cars give mechanical parts
[0:53:38] <+shry7> You can just walk over ammo or parts to pick it up btw. You don't need to press x @PatStaresAt
[0:53:49] <pipboy344> Good god. It’s not a joke? He’s playing Fortnite?
[0:53:51] <fkellington> 4 parts to upgrade

[0:54:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> i hate the jello wobble on the car stack
[0:54:03] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Where's Chun Li from Mortal Combat?
[0:54:04] <%californaya> GG!
[0:54:06] <yourliteraldog> Crafting seems like a terrible addition tbh. But then again never played this game.
[0:54:07] <DianaTheAscian> So Pats super playing with bits right?
[0:54:07] <pokefan9956> it does not appear to be a joke
[0:54:11] <ThePizzaLovingTurtle> He did it :)
[0:54:13] <%CalderGaming> that's not what GG means, Fortnite

[0:54:28] <+DrTribal> yes but it can get alot crazier
[0:54:30] <NOBLExGAMER> PAT YOU CAN LEGALLY CHEAT IF YOU TURN ON VISUALIZED SOUND EFFECTS
[0:54:32] <%holydeviant1> better position
[0:54:34] <MyNameIsRasus> BUILD UP STUPID
[0:54:34] <+thelonechris> Dig up, stupid
[0:54:34] <+deepvoid42> to have the high ground?
[0:54:35] <+Promessa_EX> it wins fights
[0:54:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> build up stupid
[0:54:36] <%valriot> DIG UP STUPID
[0:54:36] <COMB711> If you get dropped on you build a tower to god
[0:54:36] <%therustystream> build stairs and floors
[0:54:36] <ape_hawk> dig up, stupid!
[0:54:36] <+3amsoda> build a tower straight up
[0:54:37] <KeiPrime> thats the basics but yeah
[0:54:37] <%TheBensonator_> cant wait for some 11 year old to show up here and try to give Pat all the deep tech lore
[0:54:37] <%cylish> Its like dig up but works better
[0:54:37] <Xhog1> You're gonna get outplayed so fast and so hard Pat
[0:54:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Dig up stupid
[0:54:41] <+CaptainPyron> @PatStaresAt That and building to get higher than them. You know. High ground advantage.
[0:54:41] <HimakiLuvsU> height advantage
[0:54:42] <+DragonArt07> high ground
[0:54:44] <LyricalMaki> you can buildto give yourself the highground
[0:54:44] <%TheJaydedFox> TheJaydedFox subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[0:54:44] <OneThousandTomatoes> youre ready tk fight ninja now pat
[0:54:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dig up stupid
[0:54:51] <LunarRemix> Consider the camera angle and how easier it is to shoot down than it is to shot up
[0:54:52] <AMDBR9S> high ground advantage
[0:54:52] <%Bailey__gaming> get the high ground Anakin
[0:54:52] <%AzureGale> This is why we can't have nice things
[0:54:52] <Chester_goes_Berserk> so people on high ground can't shoot over the fence
[0:54:52] <fkellington> Shoot down if build up
[0:54:52] <jorniev> BUILD LADDERS TO FLY
[0:54:53] <%Jekado> yeah i guess people just build instant towers in this game the moment they hear gunfire?
[0:54:54] <+CelioHogane> @jamsbybetty tecnically fortnite already had it, they just remade it to be... less shit.
[0:54:55] <CursedNobleman> ... jesus, i cant stop staring at the characters ass. NotLikethis
[0:54:55] <+StoicMoogle> Gotta cheat
[0:54:55] <+g4mejoy> What in the hot fuck, there's hiding and crafting now?
[0:54:57] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:54:58] <pokefan9956> pat. just think. you could be playing titanfall 2 right now
[0:54:58] <ThePizzaLovingTurtle> Legally cheating PogChamp
[0:54:59] <%californaya> it just shows you where shots are coming from
[0:54:59] <mak0t0yukii> Oh no hacks on LUL
[0:55:00] <choopercabra> Personally I dont bother much with building except to get to places.
[0:55:00] <DazzlingFuhrer> help you cheat
[0:55:02] <dan_g_v> you become a house
[0:55:02] <hananafell> Gamer Mode ACTIVATED
[0:55:05] <NOBLExGAMER> YOU CAN SEE WHAT DIRECTION PEOPLE ARE RUNNING UP ON YOU FROM
[0:55:06] <+Deko_> @jamsbybetty apex did respawn beacons and like a week later fortnite added that feature LUL
[0:55:11] <KeiPrime> phone mode
[0:55:12] <HimakiLuvsU> IT'S OVER, PAT. I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND
[0:55:13] <thekillershafik> Pat, what the fuck are you doing?! Have you officially gone to the Dark Side?
[0:55:13] <aura_00> remember when this game was a completely different thing?
[0:55:13] <pipboy344> Why is Pat playing this?
[0:55:14] <CloniiCory> You'll see, literally.
[0:55:14] <InfiniteAverage> it shows footsteps and chests
[0:55:14] <those_bananas> Hacker Pat
[0:55:15] <Quite_Dapper> It shows you on the top radar where sounds are and how far away they are
[0:55:23] <+Promessa_EX> you can pop floors under your feet too
[0:55:25] <+DrTribal> you build up in order to get the highground. I don't do that cause i don't like it.
[0:55:25] <+tactician0> just hold down the build button and do a spin
[0:55:25] <%valriot> DAMN HER ASS WIDE

[1:21:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat why did you get shot when you have to not do that to win
[1:21:11] <BigLoserJosh> i dont know if its just pat's gameplay but this looks so... overwhelming
[1:21:12] <OwlLightningMage> Why build anything
[1:21:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> lets be real, do children even count as real people?
[1:21:13] <krabthecrab> You got flossed by a creeper. Or something
[1:21:14] <%JoshManVGH> you fool, you could have utilized... THE THIRD DIMENSION!
[1:21:14] <Profmcstevie> Panic building is a decent strategy
[1:21:15] <gunstars20> just build 4Head
[1:21:17] <Ipsenscastle> building a house isnt the first thing that comes to mind when dying?
[1:21:17] <%Bt_Robot> house make you safe from child
[1:21:18] <+Promessa_EX> yeah just build a huge tower in 3 seconds

[1:21:24] <yourliteraldog> Y u no build fort
[1:21:24] <Darkdrill> do a ninja
[1:21:26] <+Hilleltaco> Pat when someone shoots you in fortnite you're supposed to build a tower to the heavens and meet god, it's the rules
[1:21:29] <%goose_attack_almanac> you died because you wren't playing a juicy booty
[1:21:30] <%SolClips> come on building is half the battle
[1:21:30] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Ninja is a gigantic pussy, so yeah
[1:21:30] <+hdawger> purchase some skins.  that always makes me play better
[1:21:31] <KidKaiser23> Sponsoring an Abortion is the only proper retribution
[1:21:31] <+WizoSavage> he clearly hacked because you lost
[1:21:31] <%DirestarTV> That is super a thing, "I GET STREAM SNIPED EVERY GAME" ragequit
[1:21:32] <Zeif00> yea he do that
[1:21:32] <AvroEltz> say he was stream sniping
[1:21:32] <%Undenizen> "why don't you just build a house?" I'm sorry, are you MY DAD?
[1:21:34] <darkfilled> Why not a good game?
[1:21:35] <Darkfire346> is Ninja known for reporting ppl? I dont follow him, he seems like an ass
[1:21:36] <Jontman42> you're supposed to build a house instantly after getting shot at
[1:21:38] <+mundanelotus> You gotta build a three story building or did you really fight
[1:21:39] <%Garthunox> Yes it absolutely is, that scumbag
[1:21:39] <Xhog1> Pat do a deep dab
[1:21:41] <+patel347> so you could heal
[1:21:41] <$spleekle> LUL it was in 2018 or so
[1:21:41] <%ChrisPlaysThing> *** it has been done
[1:21:42] <%logoth_> House = cover
[1:21:43] <reddpop_> instant defense
[1:21:43] <+CelioHogane> it's a meme
[1:21:43] <%holydeviant1> I'll be honest I would exclusively playn this to buy sexy lady skins
[1:21:43] <+deepvoid42> now buy a skin to play better
[1:21:44] <amiavamp> i dont understand the appeal of 1 life game modes
[1:21:44] <%JoshManVGH> Blocks bullets
[1:21:45] <UlriktheSlayer1> EXATLY
[1:21:45] <+MelodyMedley> Yes. That's a thing
[1:21:47] <herotony04> Do a sad dab
[1:21:47] <+mikesapartment> not a house, just build in general
[1:21:47] <+Matantara> this shouldnt be entertaining but it is, nice job pat
[1:21:47] <Ravioli_Ronin> Jesus Apex & COD need auto next match
[1:21:48] <BalloniWright> for defense
[1:21:49] <+Promessa_EX> it wins fights
[1:21:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> cover
[1:21:49] <+Liokaiser> building is for losers
[1:21:50] <Rlectro> gives you time and protection
[1:21:50] <%vixenpunch> its like an extra health bar between you and the enemy
[1:21:50] <%LonePlus_> there is an incident of ninja getting a dude banned because he emoted after killing him
[1:21:51] <%xmetalicdemonx> Defense.
[1:21:51] <bakkatohri> You're lucky you didn't get any mic spam by any squeekers, Pat.
[1:21:51] <Aydarkzero> so you have cover?
[1:21:51] <gunstars20> Cover
[1:21:52] <LunarRemix> It's easier to shoot someone from high ground with cover all around you
[1:21:52] <+archangel9889> build cover
[1:21:53] <%DirestarTV> It can provide you cover @PatStaresAt
[1:21:53] <+Fynale> makes cover
[1:21:53] <Nihilisticdestroyer> cover
[1:21:53] <%코코꾸라> Cover + high ground
[1:21:54] <+CookieCutter007> More cover
[1:21:54] <+bluedude153> its cover
[1:21:54] <%baka_sugoi> to be safe
[1:21:54] <Darkdrill> house keep path save from bullet
[1:21:55] <+LionKagura> Has pat never seen fornite gameplay?
[1:21:55] <LyricalMaki> houses give you cover to heal
[1:21:56] <DiagunAquila> dfence
[1:21:56] <yourliteraldog> Report then call him a homophobic slur.
[1:21:56] <huskarl_zap> cover
[1:21:56] <+Canarchy10> for cover
[1:21:56] <xcompleasedad> House protects you from gunfire and gives you a height advantage
[1:21:56] <%xmetalicdemonx> Stops bullets
[1:21:57] <Riorii> 4Head
[1:21:57] <cherrycottontail> House is cover
[1:21:58] <%Garthunox> it'll block bullets
[1:21:58] <chrisarithmetic> cover
[1:21:58] <%holydeviant1> FOR COVER, PAT, FROM GUN
[1:21:58] <Profmcstevie> Any form of cover
[1:21:59] <%za7az> No one can sneak up on you if you have walls on all sides
[1:21:59] <%mikessdd> Watching this after playing Apex all week definitely makes this game feel like Battle Royale for babies.
[1:21:59] <OwlLightningMage> I DON'T GET IT EITHER. SOMEONE ANSWER PAT PLEASE
[1:22:00] <MyNameIsRasus> buys you enough time to heal
[1:22:01] <%JoshManVGH> Can you shoot though a house?
[1:22:01] <+tactician0> to gain the high ground
[1:22:01] <SirDogBear> These kids are molded by minecraft in their cribs, to Fortnite in their teens, boomers got no chance BibleThump
[1:22:01] <Soulsbjorne> to get high ground Anakin
[1:22:02] <OICW_Godhand> walls block bullets
[1:22:02] <%komradedog> BUILDING A HOUSE IS CRANKING 90S. It also protects you from gun fire
[1:22:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Pat do the Fortnite/Turk lawsuit  dance
[1:22:04] <+TheNewZealandStory> building is for defense and to get higher ground
[1:22:05] <+hdawger> google "build fight" and you'll understand
[1:22:05] <%asgard147> So are ya winnin' son? limesPat
[1:22:05] <Mirrorcatch> cover and vantage points
[1:22:05] <+Ragnakawaii> Build a 7 story building when you get shot at
[1:22:06] <NOBLExGAMER> YOU COULD HAVE HEALED IF YOU BUILT A HOUSE AROUND YOU
[1:22:07] <%saladin1911> It gets you a quick vantage point and your own customisable cover
[1:22:08] <%Bt_Robot> A wall between you and the other player
[1:22:09] <+mundanelotus> Its a wall to not get shot
[1:22:10] <Jontman42> building a wall is stronger than shooting a wall
[1:22:10] <%patriotrenegade> Syop bullets
[1:22:10] <%Puhff> oh i HATE the way that wall wiggled while you hit it
[1:22:12] <+Das_Prints> Putting up walls means they have to shoot through them to get to you while you heal.
[1:22:13] <+perpetualpotionmachine> I never really make houses I just burn down the other guy's house
[1:22:14] <HimakiLuvsU> using stronger mats to build a house to protect yourself to buy time to heal and such
[1:22:16] <+terry_quest> no mats
[1:22:17] <studleydoorite> cause you do bad
[1:22:19] <%holydeviant1> pat they can't shoot you through walls
[1:22:20] <%spoiledbadger> cause your bad
[1:22:20] <%xmetalicdemonx> no rmaterials
[1:22:21] <+MelodyMedley> Stops bullets
[1:22:22] <KidKaiser23> You gotta build a defense fortress
[1:22:23] <%SolClips> 4 walls then ramp
[1:22:23] <jamsbybetty> need materials
[1:22:26] <herotony04> psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab
[1:22:26] <+ALazo> so when you start an encounter you aggressively build at each other I guess
[1:22:31] <Rlectro> no materials buddy
[1:22:32] <Profmcstevie> just make a safety cube in a panic
[1:22:35] <%Bt_Robot> Remember to thank the bus driver Pat!
[1:22:35] <+TheNewZealandStory> you need materials to build, you get materials by destroying stuff with pickaxe
[1:22:37] <+patel347> stair > floor > stair> floor
[1:22:39] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> the building aspect is genuinely the reason ill never touch this fucking game
[1:22:40] <Ravioli_Ronin> The building aspect always felt out of place
[1:22:41] <%DirestarTV> People actually spend time just building so they can make entire towers in seconds
[1:22:44] <jorniev> MAKE A SQUARE STAIRWAY
[1:22:48] <+Das_Prints> A simple setup is one ramp and 4 walls around it.
[1:22:49] <%JoshManVGH> Become tower. Ascension
[1:22:54] <huskarl_zap> THANK THE DRIVER
[1:22:54] <%vixenpunch> internalize the house like an extra health bar they have to waste ammo or time on while you heal
[1:22:55] <RamenRiderZ> I miss BFBC2
[1:22:55] <MackFighters> A lot of fortnite pros in chat, holy shit lytWHAT
[1:22:56] <%Order_of_Mystery> don't forget to thank the bus driver

[1:24:24] <bakkatohri> I'm pretty sure this game has crossplay so you're probably playing against people using gyroscopic controllers on their Switch or something.

[1:25:38] <bakkatohri> @GarbageQueenEllie From my impressions of the game, iut's all cosmetic.
[1:25:44] <ChoculaUltra> did Pat victory royale yet?
[1:25:44] <KeiPrime> if anything cosmetics are more likely to make you stand out

[1:25:57] <RamenRiderZ> Pat's playing as Wooliebait™
[1:25:59] <%xmetalicdemonx> The game is interesting and I have more fun exploring the map which changes all the time
[1:26:03] <%Order_of_Mystery> i hate that this game looks so good but is so fucking scummy
[1:26:04] <+Neku054> It was a mobile thing, im guessing they said fuck it and gave it to all platforms
[1:26:05] <+MelodyMedley> Why the big butt?
[1:26:06] <$Timesteel> Ya I think Ewok was the one who championed it
[1:26:07] <+dreadsnappi> It was put in there so kids could play Fortnite in class.
[1:26:10] <Xhog1> Pat why are you making me want to play Fortnite again? What have you done to me?
[1:26:14] <hananafell> @PatStaresAt The code to unlock Lara Croft's spraypaint is static, you can just look it up and copypaste
[1:26:15] <KeiPrime> the visualization was made for the PHONE version

[1:26:43] <KaneCube> wut
[1:26:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> @saladin1911 Warzone maybe?
[1:26:47] <+Fynale> also probably helps when playing on tv's or on a phone where you can't use directional audio
[1:26:48] <NOBLExGAMER> VISUALIZE SOUND EFFECT ARE FOR DEAF PLAYERS BUT EVERYONE CAN USE THEM, IT'S LIKE USING WHEELCHAIR RAMPS OVER STAIRS.

[1:27:08] <MackFighters> @saladin1911 I recommend Titanfall 2 first before trying Apex, it's what respawn did first before making apex
[1:27:11] <jamsbybetty> the shooting skill ceiling is incredibly low but the building skill ceiling is incredibly high and I wish that was inverted I think the game would be a lot more fun
[1:27:11] <%AzureGale> We Far Cry now
[1:27:12] <gunstars20> App the bows
[1:27:16] <Meriokingston> the bow is your spirit weapon

[1:47:26] <+Das_Prints> Satan vanquished.
[1:47:29] <+thelovingfool> probably mobile players
[1:47:30] <Bakefowl> I think lower levels is more bots
[1:47:30] <+MelodyMedley> That was most likely a person

[2:13:29] <%Agami23> pat you make me depressed because i'll rewatch the DMC3 LP and then i try to play dmc3 and im like "oh no, pat was super good at this."
[2:13:29] <blue8moon> I have come to accept that pat is better than me at every game, and it makes me sad
[2:13:30] <bmoral64> Pat paid a pro to play offscreen while he holds the controller, only explanation
[2:13:30] <%SaiyanShoto> dinner
[2:13:31] <thatangryguyofde> except fighting games, and puzzles,  and shit I know there's a third thing LUL
[2:13:32] <Ipsenscastle> I'd say you oscillate between super good and the other thing
[2:13:33] <cyb3r_demon> u know pat is a professional fortnite gamer right?
[2:13:35] <NOBLExGAMER> I'VE BEEN PLAYING FORTNITE FOR 5 YEARS THOUGH

[2:13:55] <%BeeComfy> IDK about that @PatStaresAt, i've watched for a while. That statement was suspect
[2:13:57] <%AzureGale> I hear Pat took on Team Instinct at Dota 2... BY HIMSELF
[2:13:57] <%Lion_kun> Pat beat Owl Father in far less time than Woolie.
[2:14:04] <deviljhojho_> the real big brain move is finding something pat likes and getting better at it out of spite
[2:14:09] <+twohitgood> it's like a termite infestation.
[2:14:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but it's not a sponsorship like they offered Max
[2:14:13] <+dreadsnappi> Why are people surprise games are literally your job.

[2:14:27] <millionstabz> ACTUALLY EASY
[2:14:28] <Clundy> Pat needs to record a Chug Jug With You Remix

[2:18:56] <Zeif00> just noticed it
[2:18:59] <%SvenHolgersson> Rightttttttttttttt
[2:18:59] <TheAlmostBlind> btw why is this not fullscreen?
[2:18:59] <skyentombment> Pat, I'd like to say: Taking your clothes off and dancing for money on stream would be more dignified than this
[2:19:00] <%linSP> haha
[2:19:00] <%ssjklyco> I'll take that
[2:19:01] <%BoxNavy> monkaS

[2:19:20] <iosephe> yes
[2:19:21] <noirxgwen> part of it is new. 3 areas
[2:19:22] <%SirGO0SE> FORTNITE FRIDAYS

[2:19:27] <yourliteraldog> Yup your ninja now
[2:19:29] <%Monkeyweed21> its for the Larry Craft
[2:19:31] <%SaiyanShoto> you're going to be cranking 90's
[2:19:31] <Serge_12> Hey Pat, are genuinely enjoying Fortnite?
[2:19:31] <gunstars20> Pat has become the Fortnite
[2:19:32] <+mundanelotus> Weapons are new
[2:19:32] <+Promessa_EX> they've just cut up and added to this map to where it's unrecognizable
[2:19:33] <skyentombment> so I suppose this is pretty on brand!
[2:19:33] <%BoxNavy> until you get paired up with killers
[2:19:34] <huskarl_zap> Getting Tarkoved in Fortnite
[2:19:36] <blue8moon> can't believe pat has become a fortnite
[2:19:36] <Ipsenscastle> I'm so angry at you dude
[2:19:38] <+Dorf1> the crafting is all new, the map is a remix of the last map, the orange stuff is new
[2:19:39] <%Grimlockfly> IS TOMATO TOWN OKAY?
[2:19:39] <@commanderclaw> Shame you can't get Chun Li's gigantic ass anymore
[2:19:40] <+CapnClassix> I think I'd rather still play Warzone, if it fit on my hard drive
[2:19:42] <%Monkeyweed21> Apex Legends is better
[2:19:43] <+Bluecille> is that why we're here? just to suffer?
[2:19:48] <%saladin1911> It's worrying that this is making me want to play Fortnite again. NotLikeThis
[2:19:49] <%ssjklyco> Monster Hunter exist so you won't continue to play fortnite
[2:19:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I bet
[2:20:01] <NOBLExGAMER> THE MAP ALTERS EVERY SEASON AND COMPLETELY CHANGES EACH CHAPTER
[2:20:09] <thatlolifrompersona1> Fortnite fridays fax
[2:20:09] <2DSuperiority> You're not a true fortniter unless you use your parent's credit card
[2:20:09] <huskarl_zap> Tomato town is never ok
[2:20:10] <@SoFarFetched> @commanderclaw Twitter will help me with that Kappa
[2:20:10] <+Promessa_EX> little baby controller
[2:20:10] <+Night2wolf> play on switch for super easy mode
[2:20:17] <$Fortunato5678> If you want super easy wins, play on Switch
[2:20:19] <%BoxNavy> D:
[2:20:23] <Daxalog> That probably explains the higher quality of your matches and not getting insta headshotted at long range
[2:20:27] <%ShogunNoonto> so this game could look better
[2:20:30] <+Dablackone> slurp juice?
[2:20:32] <NOBLExGAMER> @Night2wolf Sam, I also sandbag from my friends on PC
[2:20:33] <%linSP> damn i could go for some blue potion
[2:20:37] <+Delenay> you beat doom dlc part 1 on the hardest difficulty, im not surprised you can do well here on a controller
[2:20:45] <+Kise77> is this on PS5 or PC?
[2:20:47] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Pat: "I'm really good at games." Also Pat: "I love auto aim." psaSmug
[2:20:48] <noirxgwen> I got into fortnite just for Chun Li and haven't looked back.
[2:20:50] <$Afterman_> did pat unlock the yautja
[2:20:50] <%BoxNavy> what is the difference between slurp juice and chug jug
[2:20:53] <%hax_metatron> Has Pat won by any chance up to  now
[2:20:57] <cyb3r_demon> prob way less hackers on the ps5 version too
[2:20:58] <bmoral64> PS5
[2:20:59] <TheAlmostBlind> wait so it's op using a controller on pc?
[2:20:59] <%eyezehuhh> Yo has Pat won any royales yet?
[2:21:07] <+Dorf1> the funniest thing about that song going viral is that both tomato town and chug jugs are long removed from the game
[2:21:08] <+necrocannibal2> why is Pat playing Fortnite?
[2:21:12] <+saltpiggu> @TIME_PUNCHER not mutually exclusive
[2:21:15] <+JakeOfalco> WutFace WutFace
[2:21:16] <those_bananas> @boxnavy catchier song
[2:21:17] <+FxyDEV> blood?
[2:21:18] <$floralkami> so, how many dubs we got so far?
[2:21:19] <yourliteraldog> It's causing you to bleed pat
[2:21:20] <+Promessa_EX> slurp is a slow heal and shield over time, chug jug is a full heal and shield

[2:31:54] <bmoral64> I've only played it once but Fortnite was fun with friends
[2:31:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The game is popular for a reason after all
[2:31:57] <ItIsSky> still have to pay for it if it isn't mobile
[2:31:58] <Jathspuh> fortnite.....good? PogChamp
[2:31:58] <cyb3r_demon> there are still tons of cheaters in fortnite lol
[2:31:59] <+kilroy_47> it had no chance LUL

[2:32:01] <%BoxNavy> Shitmess
[2:32:01] <+SinisterBroccoli> BUT GODZILLA THO
[2:32:02] <%GarbageNirvana> But frying pans on the back tho
[2:32:08] <%KineticZen> Oh well, time for PlayerUnknown to develop PubH then
[2:32:08] <yourliteraldog> It's also not an arma mod
[2:32:08] <Daxalog> Keep in mind everyone made fun of this game when it came out
[2:32:09] <%crimsonharvest> pubg was like a 3rd generation mod on top of a mod on top of an army simulator
[2:32:11] <%The_Protagonist> meanwhile PUBG is apparently getting collabs like they think anyone still plays it
[2:32:11] <+dreadsnappi> he spitting nothing but fax
[2:32:22] <masterfire23> at least you can play pubg on your mobile phone
[2:32:23] <eddie_hedgehog> wait is there a godzilla crossover?
[2:32:27] <%Monkeyweed21> remember when they tried to copyright the frying pan @PatStaresAt
[2:32:27] <StarMechV> better haul ass pat
[2:32:28] <WinstonFromUndertale> Pats playing fortnite now? Cringe
[2:32:30] <+Promessa_EX> pat it would be really poggers if you could fill an hour with fortnite talk on the podcast

[2:32:34] <%juxtest> Pubg was a pioneer
[2:32:36] <balthazar758> tru fax
[2:32:36] <Chester_goes_Berserk> still wish Apex had won out when it launched
[2:32:38] <%KineticZen> Cars are comedically loud for how slow they are
[2:32:49] <ItIsSky> apex is more my jam, but I can appreciate what fortnite does
[2:32:50] <LoneFonte> @masterfire23 i mean, android phones still can
[2:32:52] <+Nevicate> pat enforcing a healthy speed limit
[2:32:55] <+REDtheBEAST> What's this?! Pat's finally using a car?
[2:32:56] <%the22cstomp> i would legitimately play fortnite over a ton of games because it's casually fun
[2:32:59] <armchairmaster_> WHEN DID THEY ADD CARS?
[2:33:00] <huskarl_zap> let's not go to tomato town, it's a silly place
[2:33:00] <cyb3r_demon> thank god they couldnt copyright battle royales
[2:33:01] <Fluffy_Tamamo> I actually had no idea Fartnite had cars. snuffHuh

[2:33:10] <+Fynale> also wouldn't tf2 and left 4 dead get dibs on the frying pan first??
[2:33:10] <2DSuperiority> or even sell Pubg frying pans that don't work as frying pans
[2:33:14] <+Promessa_EX> this game has the terrible infinitely looping transmission sound
[2:33:15] <%The_Protagonist> YEAH
[2:33:17] <+LowBatteryLife> pubg didn't just drop the ball it they threw it straight into their own goal

[2:34:36] <+thelovingfool> same
[2:34:36] <linSP> your rite
[2:34:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> So you don't like Apex then.
[2:34:37] <%AlteisenReiseZ> You can play Apex Solo now
[2:34:38] <+Kise77> Apex has a solo queue mode
[2:34:39] <%the22cstomp> yeah forced team game mode sucks
[2:34:40] <Press_X_ToJASON> thats exactly my issue
[2:34:42] <%Feifong_wong> @PatStaresAt Apex now has solos
[2:34:46] <mrshazboto> I really thought this was gonna turn into a monster hunter stream and I'm actually not disappointed he's still playing this
[2:34:49] <$Fortunato5678> Apex needs a solo mode
[2:34:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> Duos is just solo mode
[2:34:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, since when did Apex have a solo mode?
[2:34:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> We've been over this
[2:34:55] <+HelloImTom08> other ppl suck
[2:34:55] <%saladin1911> Sounds like life ngl
[2:34:56] <masterfire23> @kise77 that's false
[2:34:57] <%Broand> Good news, you can play 1v3s instead if you want
[2:34:59] <slix3431> Hey pat do you like Anthem?
[2:34:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> You played Duo Mode and enjoyed it
[2:35:00] <+BigbysOffice> just get friends
[2:35:02] <Sunstalker> hey, now you can make a 3v with Paige and Eli since Paige her office done now kinamaHmm
[2:35:03] <Kief_Meister> This sounds HD as shit
[2:35:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> murder the children like you're Pennyworth
[2:35:05] <%GalacticaPhanto> Apex doesn't have solos
[2:35:06] <LoneFonte> PERMANENT solos, chat? or event solos?
[2:35:07] <+thelovingfool> still ques you into trio matches though
[2:35:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt You played duos and enjoyed it
[2:35:09] <+Kise77> most recent update @CommanderSqueaks
[2:35:13] <%The_Protagonist> Apex only has solo mode *sometimes*
[2:35:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> Duos is basically solos
[2:35:19] <+shotgunmcdooter> apex is cool but i don't like playing it because it takes forever to heal after a fight
[2:35:21] <mrshazboto> @PatStaresAt solos is a thing in duo que
[2:35:24] <Daxalog> Apex solos isnt real solos. Your still oging against teams
[2:35:24] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @CommanderSqueaks Since the last update. You can choose not to fill teammates to play solo
[2:35:33] <+Dorf1> that revolver is good as hell
[2:35:33] <FatherGreyBeard> Do medkits have an upper limit like the shield potions
[2:35:34] <StarMechV> ...why do you need a fishing rod?
[2:35:40] <yourliteraldog> Why fishing tho
[2:35:40] <rReizs> did you enjoy the group projects higher education stuffs in the curriculum
[2:35:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> 1 v 2 is a lot easier than 1 v 3
[2:35:53] <%GalacticaPhanto> @alteisenreisez Yeah but that means you can run into 1v3s easy
[2:35:54] <%saladin1911> @fathergreybeard yeah 3
[2:35:56] <extradopeness> That’s not the same thing as a solo queue
[2:36:01] <+SinisterBroccoli> punch dinos
[2:36:07] <%Garthunox> Pat, spawn the spectral current now!
[2:36:08] <StarMechV> so that white ring pipping up like steps means someone is enarby?
[2:36:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @StarMechV All games must have a fishing minigame, of course!
[2:36:21] <$Timesteel> they stopped  moving
[2:36:24] <yourliteraldog> Just noticed it's the BONEY BURBS
[2:36:28] <Chester_goes_Berserk> uh oh, the house 'where are they' horror
[2:36:31] <+DazedCookies> Can't believe pat is playing fortnite
[2:36:33] <FatherGreyBeard> @saladin1911 I mean t as in like small medkits can only heal you to X HP and you need a big one for a full heal? The smaller potions seem to stop at 50 shield
[2:36:34] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat cranked a 90
[2:36:35] <+captain_thickthighs> @PatStaresAt have you tried Hunt Showdown? Its horror cowboy battle royal and has a solo mode. They guns feels so good.
[2:36:49] <rReizs> is the fortnite bow a hold to draw or click to fire
[2:36:53] <$Afterman_> its not impossible
[2:36:56] <extradopeness> Oh yeah all my coworkers play hunt
[2:36:59] <+kiradusk4200> yeah if you suck
[2:37:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> are ya crankin 90s son?

[2:37:05] <+Night2wolf> @rReizs hold to draw
[2:37:07] <voltage996> Is this the part where we start flossing?
[2:37:07] <DianaTheAscian> this part is why I like/hate battle royal
[2:37:08] <%moonmintparadise> stairs
[2:37:09] <%BoxNavy> monkaS

[2:37:25] <kurosawaburdo> was that a bot?
[2:37:25] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> Just got here, why is Pat playing Fortnite, and why today?
[2:37:25] <%juxtest> If there was a bath tub up here it would be the peak battle royale experience
[2:37:28] <%The_Protagonist> wait after all that... that was the first kill in the match?
[2:37:29] <mrshazboto> Duos is easy just use Rampart and a P-Star
[2:37:29] <%AgniBrandt> It's arguably easier to stay hidden alone
[2:37:31] <extradopeness> Someone in a house
[2:37:31] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt Hunt Showdown's solo mode is a completely different beast, it's like an arcade mode compared to the main game
[2:37:31] <balthazar758> pat is now fortnite GOD
[2:37:31] <Jathspuh> damn hissssssssss good PogChamp
[2:37:32] <+captain_thickthighs> you just gotta be more conservative if your solo and load out accodingly
[2:37:34] <Press_X_ToJASON> "first player in the match to record an Elim" *8 players left*

[2:37:41] <DianaTheAscian> he might do this
[2:37:42] <$Timesteel> nice top 10
[2:37:44] <+Jungos60> I remember when This game was about building bases and defending them from Zombie Hordes. Those were fun times.
[2:37:45] <%AgniBrandt> Hunt: Showdown is fucking great though
[2:37:45] <%thebeargoesHONK> i thought this was all hyper building BS... this seems... reasonable normal
[2:37:46] <+necrocannibal2> UHHHHHHHH ACKSHYUALLY CAMPING IS NOT A VALID STRATEGY AND UHHHHHH IT TAKES NO SKILL AND UHHHHHH
[2:37:48] <%xmetalicdemonx> I'm pretty sure pat is done with bots by now
[2:37:49] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt Hide like a motherfucker bro

[2:37:55] <+perpetualpotionmachine> I can't believe Pat is playing exactly like me
[2:37:59] <zerointelligence000> Saw the title, did hell freeze over?
[2:38:00] <$Afterman_> i remember that
[2:38:02] <%The_Protagonist> wait how only 8 people left it just said you were the first person to kill someone in the game?
[2:38:03] <Wakimaki2285> he's quitting when he wins right?
[2:38:03] <+captain_thickthighs> @AyotoCorp yeah that quick play mode were its no teams
[2:38:11] <%Mrbaconator> ye this was originally a PVE GAME
[2:38:11] <yourliteraldog> Remember chat Winners Win
[2:38:11] <Press_X_ToJASON> @xmetalicdemonx there are always bots, but now it's down to a handful
[2:38:13] <+abrupt_abe> Does Fortnite exist?
[2:38:20] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> I saw a demo of the single-player zombie Fortnite and it looked so fun
[2:38:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Why not go back to playing Warzone solos?
[2:38:20] <NOBLExGAMER> FYI THERE'S ALSO AN OPTION TO AUTO SORT MEDS TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT OF YOUR BAR
[2:38:20] <kinkade_77> Don’t choke pat
[2:38:25] <Jathspuh> pc version do
[2:38:26] <$Timesteel> I remember the reveal from like 2011 or 2012
[2:38:28] <cyb3r_demon> lol imagine all that money just gone
[2:38:31] <+BIumen> fortnite is a shared hallucination
[2:38:33] <corn_dad> Fortnite still doesn't exist
[2:38:38] <Link232> God remember when Rust had zombies as well
[2:38:39] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Yeah years went by and nothing I remember that
[2:38:40] <amiavamp> time to die in a menu
[2:38:43] <iosephe> death incoming
[2:38:43] <%linSP> what a relief it must have been for them to have gotten so successful
[2:38:44] <ItIsSky> yeah the older part of fortnite was in NDA hell for half a year
[2:38:46] <%Agami23> i remember when vinny showed up on the podcast, mentioned PUBG, and you and woolie were confused
[2:38:47] <%The_Protagonist> you. did it.
[2:38:54] <karovus> i remember signing up for the fucking alpha for this game
[2:38:58] <cyb3r_demon> on pick up
[2:39:00] <+thecosmicfly> This was vaporwave for the longest time, then they literally chucked in a Battle Royale mode and take over pop culture
[2:39:03] <LoneFonte> gotta pick up again?
[2:39:03] <%Tearonex> Ye, I remember when this game first came out and it was kinda a joke
[2:39:04] <%SeanPrime22> I remember reading about fortnite in a game gameinformer mag back in like 2011
[2:39:05] <+thechungiestofbois> @PatStaresAt this game was announced at the VGAs in 2011 as "the next game from the creators of Gears of War"
[2:39:05] <+Night2wolf> it only works when you pick up
[2:39:07] <NOBLExGAMER> IT'S WHEN YOU PICK THEM UP
[2:39:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> only when you pick them up?
[2:39:08] <$serpenttucker> As much as I am in the camp that this game should have been about the "Save the world" mode, This game has been a battle royale FAR longer then it's been a single player experience, so I'm not as broken up about it.
[2:39:08] <Press_X_ToJASON> next time you get them
[2:39:10] <+Dorf1> its on pickup you can sort manualy by pressing up
[2:39:12] <2DSuperiority> when you pick up

[2:52:44] <$serpenttucker> I can see why people might like this game for the FAST AS FUCK QUEUES HOLY SHIT
[2:52:45] <%DappercatEsquire> pat actually havin fun with this?
[2:52:47] <+hdawger> there are usually a couple modes with respawns enabled (50 v 50 for example) that you could use to get more familiar with the game without fear of dying and having to restart
[2:52:47] <%Spydurman> @PatStaresAt crank a 90 yet? Bob a busser? Swing a bopper?

[2:54:01] <Clundy> Chug That Jug!
[2:54:02] <+captain_thickthighs> wait what kids watch john wick?
[2:54:02] <+ShadowWolpard> It's "not-john wick"
[2:54:17] <StrangeCoincidence> i wish this game didn't have controller support so pat would have to learn qwerty
[2:54:18] <kirketorp> did someone finally pay pat 1000 dollars to play this?
[2:54:18] <%AnIcedCoffee> That was a bot
[2:54:18] <swampwitch066> howdy long time watcher first time talker. the state puff marshmallow man should be playable
[2:54:18] <%BoxNavy> get fucked cap
[2:54:19] <maverickdrifter> 6th graders have the skill and precision of any bot in this game
[2:54:20] <%kewlmyc> Was that Captain America?
[2:54:20] <BimboBagging> i remember hearing about streamers having mental breakdowns from being forced to play Fortnite to stay relevant
[2:54:22] <TheOmniSora> another kid bites the dust

[2:54:36] <extradopeness> John wick rules I’d watch John wick if I was a kid
[2:54:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Dang, that must've been aggravating on their end
[2:54:43] <Tsuyi> He was just a child, Pat.
[2:54:46] <NOBLExGAMER> You'll start to be able to differentiate between bot an man, Bots have strict rules to what they can and can't do and how they fight.
[2:54:55] <%ssjklyco> This is that Penny Arcade comic where Gabe realized he was playing against Bots on Day of Defeat
[2:54:57] <trickquestionz> Pat is really good a Fortnite wow
[2:55:07] <Kief_Meister> THANK YOU. FUCK.
[2:55:19] <shadowboss89> I feel like I would instinctually shoot every NPC they just pop up sometimes

[2:56:00] <ronyoshi> spicy pepper jack ad
[2:56:00] <+ShadowWolpard> Revolvers and Primal Pistols use your AR ammo.  Keep that in mind in your layouts.
[2:56:01] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> @StrangeCoincidence Nah
[2:56:02] <+Dorf1> use those to escape the storm or suprise people who are turtling
[2:56:02] <Ravioli_Ronin> Have you seen ninja recently? He’s already defeated

[2:56:48] <CoffeeShopA> You don't know where thaht bottle has been\
[2:56:49] <Reanimator83> LUL
[2:56:52] <%AzureGale> Why does the guy in Monster Hunter flex after eating meat? That's fucking weird
[2:56:53] <StrangeCoincidence> tfw pat realizes he wasted his life playing fighting games where he could have been playing fortnite
[2:56:54] <NOBLExGAMER> Pat wait until you see how you refuel a car in the game
[2:56:56] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> @pswayde It's a perfectly serviceable Battle Royale
[2:56:59] <devanmuse> Because we really want to chug jug with you; we can be your fortnite gamers...
[2:57:01] <%solracc25> because kidz game
[2:57:02] <%Broand> fortnite is the opposite of eurojank, well made but soulless
[2:57:03] <yourliteraldog> You don't get cuz your not a gamer
[2:57:04] <%saladin1911> @ihavesillyknees He said it's his game of the year
[2:57:10] <%Undenizen> have you ever tried to drink something like that? real good way to choke to death!
[2:57:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's always nice when something that you get into for goofs is genuinely enjoyable
[2:57:29] <LunarRemix> It's really, really pretty
[2:57:30] <mpo9> How are you liking the crafting system? I didn't get into it too much
[2:57:32] <ihavesillyknees> @saladin1911 It wasn't even released this year that's how good it is
[2:57:33] <Ipsenscastle> is it bussin'?
[2:57:35] <Brandon__Brando> so fortnite till disco?
[2:57:36] <+captain_thickthighs> i cant tell from my tablet
[2:57:37] <TheOmniSora> I mean it's gotta, kids like bright colors
[2:57:38] <ItIsSky> looks nice
[2:57:45] <LorcaNomad> it's so pretty that it makes me mad
[2:57:47] <%juxtest> They have a lot of money to stuff into it
[2:57:53] <StarMechV> is the playstation ver crossplay?
[2:57:59] <InfiniteAverage> try it with RTX on your 3090 :)
[2:58:04] <$saladin1911> @ihavesillyknees Exactly. It transcends time
[2:58:05] <%BestTeaMaker> it's all crossplay
[2:58:06] <Press_X_ToJASON> previous seasons had upgrade benches for just weapon upgrades
[2:58:06] <TheA1ternative> Heard it here, game rocks sumG
[2:58:08] <+DoobieDancer> Pat playing this it should be called “Shortnite” LUL LUL LUL
[2:58:11] <$RealThiele> phone vs ps vs switch
[2:58:13] <ihavesillyknees> Did he meet Mr. Beast yet?
[2:58:14] <mudapersona> the power of mom's credit card money right here
[2:58:16] <%plebeiusMaximus> Every time a child maxes out his mom's credit card, fortnite gets prettier and prettier
[2:58:20] <ItIsSky> fair
[2:58:20] <+JakeOfalco> your pulling me back in
[2:58:20] <+Dorf1> it annoys me that all the good weapons are locked behind crafting but they arent new cool weapons and just the normal vanilla ones aside from the bows
[2:58:26] <swampwitch066> you enjoy it?
[2:58:26] <Aydarkzero> true
[2:58:29] <%afronooch> LUL
[2:58:29] <%hq_residential_house> LUL
[2:58:32] <%Necnill> sweat.... hards....
[2:58:35] <maverickdrifter> yeah my main beef with fortnite is the fact its more or less created a monopoly on both kids' time and money cuz it's fun to get into but like, I also like rotating the games I play y'know
[2:58:37] <+BusterRepukken> so no playing against ninja huh
[2:58:38] <extradopeness> @doobiedancer holy fuck dude you killed him
[2:58:45] <LorcaNomad> "competetive"
[2:58:48] <+Fynale> doesn't PC have controller support that puts you with controller players?
[2:58:49] <TheOmniSora> it's fortnite, sweathards are everywhere LUL
[2:58:51] <ItIsSky> pc players who can build a 4 story house in 5 seconds
[2:58:51] <+drk_sd> all that comes with the 3080?
[2:58:55] <%Tman451> yeah those try-sweats
[2:58:57] <mpo9> Fornite has support for woolie's basterized keyboard controller setup iirc
[2:59:01] <%ssjklyco> Doesn't the PS5 version have RTX anyway?
[2:59:02] <StrangeCoincidence> yeah you dont get to cheat on pc
[2:59:06] <Saltmeisterr> Gitgud
[2:59:09] <LunarRemix> They had to, competitive people were abusing it
[2:59:09] <studleydoorite> @drk_sd LUL
[2:59:10] <NOBLExGAMER> It's easy to understand Pat, Ninja complained and they changed it.

[3:01:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Professional Gamer Patrick "Chug Jug" Boivin
[3:01:30] <%saladin1911> @lunarremix Then just tell them to tune down the setting in the options. Aim Assist strength is literally a setting
[3:01:30] <ihavesillyknees> @BoxNavy Weekly? He'll never find Mr. Beast like that
[3:01:34] <balthazar758> gamer GOD
[3:01:48] <EnergyMax> must drink fast, consume only half of jug
[3:01:48] <Kief_Meister> GRAB THE MINIS, GOOD FOR QUICK SHIELDS IN A FIGHT
[3:01:49] <NOBLExGAMER> Pat the controller change on PC is simple to understand, Ninja aka Mr. Fortnite complained so Epic complied with is demands.
[3:01:50] <+Dorf1> storms coming soon pat
[3:01:54] <cyb3r_demon> lol
[3:02:02] <Link232> I gotta admit I love the animations for using stuff that they have now
[3:02:05] <marvel877> So how long before Pat Stares At Roblox?   ...eww, that felt disgusting typing that.
[3:02:06] <%linSP> broke wall LEVEL UP
[3:02:06] <+thechungiestofbois> #freefortnite
[3:02:06] <mattdaddyd101> is pat the next Ninja
[3:02:09] <%saladin1911> @lunarremix I'm not arguing with you btw. The situation just has me dumbfounded LUL
[3:02:10] <mpo9> Have you thought about getting yourself one of those creator tags to get the sweet sweet vbucks without having to actually spend a dime
[3:02:13] <extradopeness> Soulja boy muffled in the distance
[3:02:16] <%CokeMilkRequiem> that looks like the battle pass
[3:02:19] <LunarRemix> @saladin1911 You mean tell players to do that? You can't really tell players which settings are allowed in competitive settings vs regular play. They did tone down the aim assist for everyone.
[3:02:23] <TheOmniSora> Ninja wants to be like pat..
[3:02:29] <yourliteraldog> @NOBLExGAMER He really has that kind of pull?
[3:02:30] <StrangeCoincidence> the apex battle pass feels so bad
[3:02:31] <%plebeiusMaximus> @CokeMilkRequiem That's what im saying
[3:02:35] <DianaTheAscian> is that an exp bar at the bottom?
[3:02:37] <ihavesillyknees> The Graphics look amazing, the characters look weird and rubbery, but the environment is amazing
[3:02:37] <+FishyLamar1> Don't worry it gets slower
[3:02:39] <%Solarint> where is everyone? its been years since I played a BR game but this feels very low pop
[3:02:41] <%ABakedDemon> Ninja wishes he was pat
[3:02:41] <NOBLExGAMER> @mpo9 This, I want Pat to make money off my addiction.
[3:02:46] <$Timesteel> naw it's pretty fast
[3:02:46] <swampwitch066> everyone wants to be pat
[3:02:49] <mpo9> The last one got a bit tough at like, 80-100 iirc
[3:02:52] <KeiPrime> its very easy to hit 100
[3:02:52] <cochrun> worst battlepass was def blops4
[3:02:52] <+BusterRepukken> Yashiro looks fucking good
[3:02:55] <Lord_Magtok> It gets way slower, this is just how you get hooked
[3:02:56] <Brandon__Brando> it slows down to a crawl
[3:02:58] <syanplague> That how they hook you Pat
[3:03:01] <+Dorf1> i got to 100 on the last on and it doesnt slow down that much
[3:03:01] <%AnIcedCoffee> The Dead By Daylight battlepasses are garbage
[3:03:04] <marvel877> Since Pat's becoming the new Ninja, how long before Pat's on The Masked Singer?
[3:03:06] <+weratewrestlers> Press the win button to win
[3:03:12] <NOBLExGAMER> @yourliteraldog Yes, he got a kid banned for legitimately killing him in game.
[3:03:14] <Daxalog> Would a battle royale fit in Guilty Gears lore?
[3:03:17] <LunarRemix> @saladin1911 I understand, it's okay. It is a little bit weird. It's something that had to be toned down because competitive people were abusing it. That's the gist for most of the game's balance. It's fine for everyone else but competitive people abuse it and then it gets nerfed
[3:03:28] <%plebeiusMaximus> @AnIcedCoffee I legit forget that DBD has a battle pass
[3:03:30] <+BusterRepukken> Team Orochi is coming back I guess
[3:03:34] <ihavesillyknees> Remember that guy who played Fortnite to preach the bible?
[3:03:36] <Brandon__Brando> @daxalog fuck it sure
[3:03:36] <NinjaMii> I honestly can’t believe you’re playing Fortnite. It’s making me wanna play it now
[3:03:39] <TheOmniSora> It's ninja, he wants to 1v1 you, and then report you when you kill him
[3:03:41] <bakkatohri> Okay, I'm back from trying Fortnite out again for myself. Does it get harder the more you play or something? Shouldn't victory royals be harder than this?
[3:03:41] <%Garthunox> thats the supply drop noise btw
[3:03:45] <studleydoorite> how long till Pat is flossing in Time's Square on NYE?
[3:03:46] <Reanimator83> @solarint its Pats play style.
[3:03:47] <+Dorf1> the phone call sound was a new supply drop showing up on the map
[3:03:49] <EnergyMax> @ihavesillyknees what a sketchy guy x.x
[3:03:51] <%BoxNavy> the sweatmen live there
[3:03:54] <extradopeness> I’m seriously considering reinstalling it rn
[3:03:56] <%Monkeyweed21> play on M+K loser
[3:03:58] <yourliteraldog> 1v1 ninja
[3:04:02] <TheA1ternative> Yes hello? 📞 4Head
[3:04:04] <DianaTheAscian> wait but its crossplay?
[3:04:08] <Boxortoo> @PatStaresAt If you play on controller on pc you get queued against other pc players using controllers
[3:04:09] <%Spydurman> Pat you always sweat, we know about the Damp Spot
[3:04:10] <xcompleasedad> @studleydoorite Fuck you for reminding me
[3:04:12] <+DoktorZee> respawn vans
[3:04:12] <NOBLExGAMER> PAT THE BABY SLAYER IN THE ITEM SHOP NOW
[3:04:13] <ItIsSky> they respawn party friends
[3:04:14] <%Undenizen> isn't it platform ambiguous when you play?
[3:04:14] <Sadnehs> jesus christ pat you're playing Fortnite?
[3:04:15] <+JakeOfalco> party respawn
[3:04:15] <mpo9> revive places for squads
[3:04:16] <+KevinsLunchbox> the only thing i know about fortnite is that time double shotguns was the meta
[3:04:17] <Kief_Meister> Respawn trucks
[3:04:17] <+captain_thickthighs> i feel if you pay a grand just to game your gonna be a bit try hard
[3:04:19] <ihavesillyknees> @EnergyMax Yep, told a child he'd go to hell for saying goddammit, what a champ
[3:04:22] <+ShadowWolpard> Reboot vans for playing in groups.
[3:04:25] <%ShogunNoonto> but cross play
[3:04:26] <%saladin1911> @lunarremix Competitive specific settings are a thing for like every game. Tournament runners ban things. Games have built-in limitations for specific competitive game modes.
[3:04:27] <+Dorf1> respawn points for squads
[3:04:29] <%etnoika> Just got here, how many 8 year olds has Pat killed yet?
[3:04:30] <swampwitch066> alot
[3:04:30] <%BoxNavy> 1
[3:04:31] <cyb3r_demon> you also get all the mobile fortnite players on console
[3:04:31] <studleydoorite> @xcompleasedad I can never forget, suffer with me
[3:04:36] <MackFighters> about 7
[3:04:39] <Boxortoo> More then you would think.
[3:04:41] <+tuchpi> all bots PogChamp
[3:04:42] <CrimsonFox777> 2
[3:04:45] <+thelovingfool> more you think less than you hope
[3:04:49] <+abrupt_abe> How small can any Fortnite mode be?
[3:04:52] <BimboBagging> the real way to play is to emulate a phone on your pc and play with crossplay off
[3:04:54] <%Monkeyweed21> 1% of 100 million is still 1 million @PatStaresAt
[3:04:55] <Kief_Meister> GRAB MINIS DUDE CMOOOON
[3:04:58] <%MisterRockett> Fortnight is the most popular game out right now, Pat. That's still hundreds of thousands of players.
[3:04:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> Like 5 or 6
[3:05:01] <+GundamF91> Yashiro was the KOF character btw
[3:05:04] <EnergyMax> @ihavesillyknees i can't stand toxic christianity, like, go yell at your own family for not praying enough, just keep it to yourself
[3:05:07] <NOBLExGAMER> You can switch to KB+M after queuing in with Controller on PC
[3:05:08] <+JustToWatch> new KOF is Yashiro Nanakasei
[3:05:09] <%dork_doggler> how is everyone killing each other and pat ain't seen someone in like tne minutes
[3:05:10] <Boxortoo> I do controller queues when I'm looking for less sweaty game sand never have trouble finding matches.
[3:05:13] <+willsg98> hey there, just stopping by to say hi. i need to go sleep. Have fun with whatever you're doing!
[3:05:16] <ItIsSky> yeah
[3:05:19] <+BusterRepukken> Yashiro looks awesome
[3:05:19] <+DoktorZee> yup
[3:05:19] <ihavesillyknees> The better question: How many 8 years old killed Pat?
[3:05:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> Too much crossplay
[3:05:21] <LunarRemix> @saladin1911 With Fortnite they usually like to play by the game's default rules. They usually don't mess too much with it. Sometimes it leads to problems where tournaments happen within hours of a new update with completely new content that shifts the meta
[3:05:23] <%plebeiusMaximus> Yeah its all cross progression
[3:05:26] <masterfire23> does fortnite run at 120fps on mobile
[3:05:27] <%CokeMilkRequiem> Remember when this game was cancelled
[3:05:32] <mpo9> I heard playstation was locked due to sony's bullshit for a while though
[3:05:47] <Kief_Meister> @mpo9 not any more
[3:05:50] <+BusterRepukken> its been 24 years since Yashiro was in a game btw. Canon wise.
[3:05:50] <%Elky3> @patstaresat pat is playing Fortnite? POGGERS
[3:05:50] <ihavesillyknees> The trash thing is weird.
[3:05:51] <waffleandman> i wished it was canceled
[3:05:51] <EnergyMax> the... the dumpster... what?
[3:05:53] <studleydoorite> sproingy trash makes me feel uncomfortable

[3:06:19] <simifu> ...why?
[3:06:19] <+FishyLamar1> PogChamp
[3:06:20] <%bapposbungers> Like, I personally enjoy the building aspect of the game and what not, but why'd it turn out to be a BR after being announced as a PvE adventure game?
[3:06:21] <%GarbageNirvana> Nice pyramid, idiot

[3:07:07] <extradopeness> THE BLUE PLATE COLLECTION BEGINS
[3:07:08] <DianaTheAscian> top off
[3:07:12] <LunarRemix> @saladin1911 They tried doing different rules for competitive before, like you'd get free shields for elimininations. But then that lead the problem of competitive looking and being a completely different than the regular game, which alienated some players and frankly made the whole thing really weird
[3:07:16] <+hdawger> WAR IS HELL
[3:07:21] <%The_Protagonist> pat
[3:07:21] <bakkatohri> I can't believe Fortnite is actually a good game. I completely ignored it because of the memes and the overabundance of S Q U  E E K E R S.
[3:07:23] <SpartanDumpster> I do like the building in this game, at it's simplest form, cause a wall stops each game from going "first person to see the other wins"
[3:07:23] <Kief_Meister> No shields a lot of health though

[3:08:27] <bakkatohri> Note: Mobile controls are just as accurate as PC if you're using gyroscope.
[3:08:30] <cyb3r_demon> many many dead babies
[3:08:31] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt That was good though, multiple kills, good shots? You're pretty good for an O L D M A N
[3:08:31] <mpo9> How did you decide to play the game anyways? Lara Croft or something
[3:08:31] <+FishyLamar1> Definitely stream sniped  Kappa
[3:08:32] <huskarl_zap> shotguns suck

[3:08:39] <KaiFawkes> Am i in the wrong time line?
[3:08:44] <TheOmniSora> oof
[3:08:47] <Boxortoo> @PatStaresAt by the way the first few weeks of a new season is always rough because SBMM doesn't kick in yet so you get all the sweats early on. It balances out after awhile
[3:08:53] <+thechungiestofbois> @PatStaresAt why aren't you mad you lost at this childrens game?
[3:08:57] <+JasonTheJazz> Yashiro in KOF XV
[3:08:57] <%saladin1911> @lunarremix Yeah, but that's still their own fault. I do remember that weird shit tho aha. Just limit aim assist in tournaments is all I'm saying they need to do. If I'm not wrong, there's literally a slider in the options to do just that so yeah
[3:08:58] <marvel877> Is Pat going to keep playing till he get's his chicken dinner and never play the Fortnites again?
[3:09:01] <%BoxNavy> hes so fucking ancient jermaOld
[3:09:01] <+seoliart> tomatoOld
[3:09:03] <%The_Protagonist> oh fuck, Yashiro just got revealed for KOF15
[3:09:06] <+DeaconBluesClues> how much of this is due to due matchmaking not knowing who to pair him with and how much is it is due to years of playing WW2 halflife mods

[3:10:03] <NinjaMii> “You are not ready, boy”
[3:10:04] <%dork_doggler> who no predator
[3:10:04] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt will this become a weekly staple
[3:10:09] <jorniev> ok hear me out VAAZ from FAR CRY 3 in fortnite
[3:10:09] <%juxtest> Close your heart to the children Boi
[3:10:09] <mpo9> I have Chun-Li and she actually has an Ass bigger then the norm
[3:10:10] <codepoke> you didn't even need to buy predator
[3:10:13] <NeutrinoInteraction> Yeah they usually come back. Predator might come back too, it's unlikely but who knows
[3:10:15] <%sleeplessmetro> is Mando still available as a skin? or is that shit gone
[3:10:19] <%s_xylocalsingles> YES
[3:10:20] <+OrangeMDT> I just rewatched the God of War lp
[3:10:23] <xxshadowxx416> why is predator gone forever
[3:10:26] <cyb3r_demon> lots of chests in the attics
[3:10:26] <KeiPrime> mando was last season pass
[3:10:27] <Quite_Dapper> Yeah Battle Pass rewards are exclusive it's kind of a bummer that there's no such thing as a rerun event
[3:10:27] <%saladin1911> Pat playing as Predator on Fortnite seems sus
[3:10:30] <NOBLExGAMER> Yes, that is the play Pat
[3:10:39] <+YiggityYoni> predator was free too
[3:10:42] <mpo9> Preadator and Mando are in the battle pass so never ever coming back.
[3:10:52] <%Toynota10> The next KOF character was Yashiro
[3:10:53] <%astuteabberation> oh man time to watch my favorite streamer,PatStaresAt , play the HOTTEST game of 2k17, $freefortnite
[3:10:53] <SpartanDumpster> Epic really knows how to squeeze the cash from you now tho. Not only would you buy Predator, you'd likely want to buy the dumbest emotes to make him do!
[3:10:59] <+BusterRepukken> bro im so hyped for Team Orochi to come back
[3:10:59] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt a cooler
[3:11:05] <cyb3r_demon> explosion sound?
[3:11:05] <Press_X_ToJASON> it's a safe
[3:11:08] <+FishyLamar1> I hate shit is limited time
[3:11:09] <KeiPrime> can they add shermie to fortnite?
[3:11:11] <LunarRemix> @saladin1911 Well they have to balance the game for everyone, not just competitive tournaments. Aim assist was still a problem even outside tournaments in casual play, it locks your aim through walls effectively giving away the other player position. It was a real problem and I'm talking as someone who plays on the PC
[3:11:14] <NOBLExGAMER> Also you'll never get Mandalorian or like All the good Marvel characters, which is super lame.
[3:11:15] <TheOmniSora> So is it like every game made in UE4 can have it's characters on FN all of a sudden?
[3:11:15] <+VexicBayn> is the boy doing the fortnife
[3:11:29] <+shry7> Did Pat up the sensitivity on the controls? It looks good
[3:11:31] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt Grab fish, quick heals in a pinch
[3:11:34] <%AnIcedCoffee> i hear a chicken
[3:11:38] <TrixxImp> I've been playing fortnite for like 3 years and I didn't know that visual indicator option was a thing for chests
[3:11:40] <cyb3r_demon> bock bock
[3:11:41] <Sunstalker> LUL
[3:11:47] <%californaya> hello I'm back from wrestling, has he been Forting this whole time?
[3:11:49] <SpartanDumpster> I broke down and bought the John Wick skin, and then I couldn't resist getting goofy emotes, like the cheerleading one, just to make him do them!
[3:11:51] <NOBLExGAMER> I wish the crossover BP stuff would eventually show up in the shop at a markup so people who missed out could nab it.
[3:11:52] <+DeaconBluesClues> I literally have never watch anyone play fortnite on twitch before
[3:11:59] <+MythosDeity> Visual indicators for audio queues is insanely broken lmao. Surely that has to be disabled in competitive
[3:12:01] <+FishyLamar1> under
[3:12:02] <Quite_Dapper> @TheOmniSora It's only a matter of time before we get an unreal tournament battle pass.... right?
[3:12:04] <Kief_Meister> @TrixxImp It wasnt till like, 2 seasons ago
[3:12:05] <GeltonZ> Yo WHAT?! Pat is playing Fortnite?! Oh man how did I miss so much of this!
[3:12:13] <ihavesillyknees> Why is this game called fortnite?
[3:12:16] <cyb3r_demon> amazing 3d sound
[3:12:28] <+DeaconBluesClues> good sound design, gotta say
[3:12:29] <swampwitch066> once again stay puft marshmallow man should be playable
[3:12:40] <Boxortoo> random
[3:12:40] <ThePizzaLovingTurtle> Watching everyone trickle in and discover Pat playing Fortnite is still funny to me.
[3:12:41] <%BoxNavy> 🐓 boc boc boc boc boc
[3:12:42] <generalve> I'm a bit fucking salty at you that you got your first solo victory in a day but for me it was like months
[3:12:46] <cyb3r_demon> random
[3:12:46] <TrixxImp> The sound design in buildings can be terifying monkaS
[3:12:46] <mpo9> The sound is actually not 3d if you turn the sound icons on iirc.
[3:12:46] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt Pretty sure same spots
[3:12:51] <LunarRemix> Depends on the season
[3:12:58] <+ShadowWolpard> Same spot, spawning is randomized.
[3:13:02] <%californaya> I missed a Royale with Cheese? shit
[3:13:06] <+DeaconBluesClues> @ihavesillyknees it used to be a zombie horde survival PvE game where you had to survive for 14 days, that is, a "fortnite"
[3:13:06] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:13:09] <TheOmniSora> @ihavesillyknees it used to be a zoombie survival shooter, but then the BR mode made more money so they scraped it
[3:13:09] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 oh man, it's  streamy time with Pattie
[3:13:09] <+BusterRepukken> >pat realizing he likes this game
[3:13:15] <%BoxNavy> mondays podcast is gonna be fun
[3:13:16] <Darkred28> Pat became a professional Fortnite streamer now?
[3:13:16] <+aogman> is Mando skin gone forever?
[3:13:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> Fortnite good? FUCK
[3:13:17] <mpo9> @generalve You start in bot lobbies now for ez wins and dopemine
[3:13:18] <%saladin1911> @lunarremix Okay, so they essentially just fucked up aim assist on PC specifically? Because isn't it unchanged for console players? I'm confused
[3:13:18] <StencilOST> dont let it set it
[3:13:18] <Kief_Meister> @generalve Just gotta keep playing and kicking ass
[3:13:20] <Captbutt> oh he loves it kmaHmm1
[3:13:23] <DomonTrigger> The Fortnite Redemption Arc
[3:13:24] <balthazar758> too late pat, you're on the bus now
[3:13:26] <%Bt_Robot> ProZD just released his CHUGJUG video
[3:13:27] <NinjaMii> lmao
[3:13:29] <generalve> I think cause ps5 has ray tracing  for fortnite  ?
[3:13:30] <morningmoondude> I don't like that KZ and you are making me want to play this
[3:13:31] <gunstars20> FUCK LUL
[3:13:33] <TrixxImp> He's liking it, fortnite good game atp1000
[3:13:37] <KeiPrime> pat and fortnite sitting in a tree
[3:13:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I think the character models are a bit goofy, but this game does have some nice looking landscapes
[3:13:39] <%californaya> I just don't wanna build, that's really the only thing stopping me from playing this
[3:13:43] <%moonmintparadise> Autum colors allways look awesome in games
[3:13:43] <%Bt_Robot> It's sung by goofy
[3:13:45] <SpartanDumpster> Yeah the art style's really what makes me prefer this over about all other BR games. Enemy players actually stand out.
[3:13:45] <%BoxNavy> yes
[3:13:46] <%Dunmarkh> yeah
[3:13:47] <%moonmintparadise> way superior to snow maps
[3:13:47] <+aogman> @PatStaresAt supply drop
[3:13:48] <+DoktorZee> its storm timer
[3:13:48] <$KnivesEve> pat is no exclusive fortnite streamer now
[3:13:50] <ThePizzaLovingTurtle> I mean, if he likes it he likes it, can't fault a man for liking something despite others' opinions.
[3:13:50] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt the phone noise is a new drop coming in
[3:13:52] <%GalacticaPhanto> what sucks is the game isn't actually bad, just has a shit ton of kids and sweats
[3:13:52] <ihavesillyknees> Huh, interesting thanks guys
[3:13:53] <%astuteabberation> the frog??????
[3:13:53] <TheOmniSora> Ninja wants his 1v1 Pat
[3:13:55] <InfiniteAverage> that's the supply drop noise
[3:14:00] <Broken_Sonex> @KeiPrime K I S S I N G
[3:14:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> yes
[3:14:07] <swampwitch066> they try to call u pat to distract you
[3:14:08] <%Garthunox> its a supply drop
[3:14:10] <Darkred28> I give a shit.
[3:14:15] <Blackscience91> Pat likes the popular game. What glorious fun
[3:14:21] <%xmetalicdemonx> the supply drop is good tho
[3:14:22] <TheA1ternative> 📞 4Head Hello?
[3:14:26] <ihavesillyknees> It's NOT ABOUT A GAME MAN, IT'S ABOUT PRIDE!!!!
[3:14:29] <LunarRemix> @saladin1911 Aim assist was too strong, for everyone. But it wasn't an issue until competitive players learned how to play on the controller. The controller was always stronger due to aim assist, it just took time for pros to figure it out since anyone who's slightly competitive would always jump to mouse and keyboard.
[3:14:30] <+VexicBayn> so when does pat grow the fortnite streamer headband? that's how it works right? it grows like a vestigial horn?
[3:14:30] <ComancheNate> pat you can organize your toolbar with up D-pad as well
[3:14:34] <+DeaconBluesClues> people might be mad when I say this but games like fortnite andm inecraft all basically have the same arc: they coe out, get super popular, a shitload of small children get into it and all the cool adult boomer kids leave, and then like 5 years later after the kids age out the cool boomers return and claim they liked it all along and never thought it was for stupid babies
[3:14:36] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt Nah, that shotguns amazing, you just gotta face fuck people with it and they are instantly melted
[3:14:46] <+flexin_apex> Incoming 1 hr long podcast Talk of why pat is fortnite now lol
[3:14:49] <jahsmittsii> Is this what the world is coming to?
[3:14:50] <DudeDern> Has he found any llamas yet?
[3:14:50] <GeltonZ> Has Pat tried Team Rumble yet? Because that's my mode of choice because I love being a "casual that is destroying Fortnite" :D
[3:14:50] <%Tman451> this visual audio thing is BIG cheats
[3:14:58] <ihavesillyknees> Pat needs to paint his beard blue to complete the Fortnite transformation
[3:14:59] <rufus2k2> looking kind of Barrens there
[3:15:00] <elicoy> wheres all the snipers at?
[3:15:07] <+Promessa_EX> it would be funny
[3:15:12] <+DeaconBluesClues> c r a z y t
[3:15:13] <KeiPrime> where mankrik's wife
[3:15:16] <xeros720> mostly gonna talk about chun-li's ass
[3:15:16] <Kief_Meister> @Tman451 Nah, you just gotta be good to kill people lol
[3:15:24] <mpo9> What was Apex's problem?
[3:15:25] <%hurricainejr> are boobie traps still a thing?
[3:15:30] <ihavesillyknees> Did you play Apex?
[3:15:37] <%Dunmarkh> @mpo9 no solo
[3:15:38] <+VexicBayn> call of duty good tho
[3:15:40] <TrixxImp> Remember firestorm atpRtsd
[3:15:41] <NOBLExGAMER> @hurricainejr They're coming back soon
[3:15:41] <GeltonZ> HARPOON GUN IS SO GOOD!
[3:15:41] <gunstars20> God warzone eats space LUL
[3:15:41] <%DappercatEsquire> @mpo9 no solo queue i'd guess
[3:15:42] <%sleeplessmetro> no true solo I think
[3:15:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> Apex is great
[3:15:43] <+dante_must_die_exe> They let you que for Solo/Duos in Apex now, pat.
[3:15:43] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt But what if Woolie brings up how you ranted how you hated how Fortnite plays like 2-3 years ago
[3:15:43] <swampwitch066> the best type of gun
[3:15:44] <%xmetalicdemonx> scorpion get over here
[3:15:45] <nekrabeats> pats gonna die soon
[3:15:46] <%GarbageNirvana> Apex's problem is forced 3v3
[3:15:47] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt Harpoon gun hurts but its single shot
[3:15:48] <TheOmniSora> you said boobie..
[3:15:49] <DianaTheAscian> that was super close
[3:15:49] <%GarbageNirvana> According to Pat
[3:15:52] <peanutdot007> Can it compete with RADICAL HEIGHTS though?
[3:15:54] <Broken_Sonex> @DeaconBluesClues It's an endless cycle.
[3:15:54] <ItIsSky> apex was the 3v3 caveat for him
[3:15:57] <rufus2k2> I wish they could make a smaller single player game with this kind of aesthetic
[3:15:59] <millionstabz> Do you want to play call of Duty with tons of cheaters?
[3:15:59] <%YakumoYomi> Apex's problem (for Pat) is probably the lack of solo
[3:16:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> Apex problem is overpriced market
[3:16:04] <+Prinny_Raider> One thing I note as a fighting game player I'm jealous how fast you seem to jump into the next game
[3:16:05] <+FishyLamar1> its even smaller on pc if you dont download the high res textures
[3:16:11] <ihavesillyknees> Ooooh yeah not being able to solo sucks
[3:16:12] <Quite_Dapper> PogChamp
[3:16:13] <mpo9> @rufus2k2 Save the world Kappa
[3:16:13] <+DeaconBluesClues> @AnIcedCoffee 3 years is a long time for a game
[3:16:16] <LorcaNomad> Warzone is a good battle royale but fuck you I am not downloading 1TB for it
[3:16:25] <Darkred28> KomodoHype
[3:16:25] <DianaTheAscian> wow
[3:16:26] <TheOmniSora> baby down
[3:16:27] <%saladin1911> @lunarremix Eh alright. Well hopefully it's all balanced now then.
[3:16:28] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt See? fucking MELTS
[3:16:32] <+KevinsLunchbox> you just killed a Dad
[3:16:32] <%moonmintparadise> jesus that did damage

[3:16:42] <+superkeaton> a guy he killed
[3:16:43] <%AnIcedCoffee> @DeaconBluesClues I know but Woolie will still bring it up if he remembers
[3:16:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> you killed a person! mazel tov!
[3:16:57] <LorcaNomad> defeat all the children pat
[3:16:57] <+FishyLamar1> @DappercatEsquire I do FeelsBadMan
[3:16:58] <Darkred28> F
[3:16:58] <DianaTheAscian> wow
[3:16:59] <+VexicBayn> @millionstabz the cheating isn't that prevalent, people just dont realize the cod sweats are fucking molded in sweat
[3:17:00] <%juxtest> Some other guy
[3:17:00] <%The_Protagonist> oh
[3:17:01] <%moonmintparadise> STEALTHED
[3:17:01] <%californaya> you got Bushed
[3:17:02] <poisin224> LUL
[3:17:03] <rufus2k2> @mpo9 :(
[3:17:03] <GeltonZ> @DappercatEsquire Now, only emotes remain... HyperHaste HyperGravity HyperJump
[3:17:05] <TheA1ternative> A player they killed
[3:17:05] <%moonmintparadise> you got METAL GEARED
[3:17:05] <iosephe> F
[3:17:06] <devanmuse> THAT'S what he was shooting at
[3:17:06] <SpartanDumpster> Yeah, PUBG the colors are so muted, I'm basically looking at grey enemies in grey environments. With CoD and APEX, I just don't like BR games being FPS
[3:17:08] <%Dunmarkh> get nae naed
[3:17:09] <%Undenizen> damn she fuckin jumped you
[3:17:09] <ihavesillyknees> DAMN YOU BROMOETOE
[3:17:09] <TheOmniSora> bromoetoe LUL
[3:17:11] <TrixxImp> anyone remember bfv's firestorm lmao
[3:17:12] <zamzoph> killed by lara croft
[3:17:12] <%RadDude6969> killed by children
[3:17:14] <+thechungiestofbois> IM GOING TO KILL ALL OF YOU - Lara Croft
[3:17:16] <%saladin1911> @dappercatesquire Oh God. I played that like once. The movement wasn't too bad tbf but everything else was meh
[3:17:17] <Boxortoo> @DappercatEsquire Hyperscape would have been better if it wasn't for the bullshit with twitch being forced. It wasn't fun to be having fun and then some streamer's dumb ass chat votes on low gravity.
[3:17:17] <+superkeaton> Goddamn bushwookiees
[3:17:18] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt Harpoon gun is great for early rounds cause it does a lot of damage but not for later...as you saw lol
[3:17:18] <+aogman> you got fuckin bushwhacked
[3:17:20] <+DeaconBluesClues> oh no! other FPS boomers have come to hunt babies! and now you're the baby!
[3:17:22] <huskarl_zap> fucking bushwookie
[3:17:23] <sinbad2058> I missed the joke why fortnight?
[3:17:24] <ComancheNate> must've been a bumper jumper
[3:17:28] <%GarbageNirvana> You merely adopted the sweat; they were born in it, molded by it
[3:17:29] <+kidcoheed> OK does Pat want to smash his Controller yet?
[3:17:30] <fritz_dacat> curse that tomb raider
[3:17:30] <nekrabeats> Thoughts on all the crossover skins pat?
[3:17:32] <%Deft_Thought> Fortnite looks a lot different than what I recall. Still not my thing but seems fine.
[3:17:39] <DianaTheAscian> its super bland
[3:17:42] <swampwitch066> its all about ww2
[3:17:44] <+mczarklesby> Harpoon gun is pathfinder
[3:17:44] <ihavesillyknees> That sucks
[3:17:46] <%DakotaMacDoodle> played out and scummy
[3:17:50] <+dante_must_die_exe> You can que Solo/Duo in Apex, Pat.
[3:17:52] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt Apparently you can play solo in Apex now
[3:17:52] <%AzureGale> They have solos in Apex now
[3:17:53] <+flexin_apex> I get it ...apex is great but I understand why pat rather play solo.  Solos was fun the 1 time respawn did it ...got a win with wattson too
[3:17:57] <+VexicBayn> public G is gross
[3:17:57] <LorcaNomad> apex sucks ass without friends
[3:17:59] <+DeaconBluesClues> @PatStaresAt didn't they add solo queue
[3:18:02] <Daxalog> You cannot
[3:18:03] <%DappercatEsquire> get hyped for the FF7 battle royale we've all wanted
[3:18:03] <millionstabz> NO
[3:18:04] <%AzureGale> Yes
[3:18:04] <+Kise77> yeah
[3:18:05] <%Feifong_wong> Yes
[3:18:06] <TheOmniSora> because they try to combine BR with heroshooter
[3:18:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> 2 V2
[3:18:08] <mudapersona> apex does not have solo
[3:18:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> HOLY SHIT
[3:18:09] <%s_xylocalsingles> PUBG Mobile is big in china mooD
[3:18:10] <%charp35> does anyone play pubg anymore?
[3:18:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> PLAY DUOS
[3:18:12] <+thechungiestofbois> yes
[3:18:14] <codepoke> you can turn off fill
[3:18:15] <xxshadowxx416> pubgwhat that
[3:18:15] <marklarphd> I heard the news, are you okay pat?
[3:18:16] <TrixxImp> You can play solo now but you have to play against trios @PatStaresAt
[3:18:16] <+FishyLamar1> how about culling 2
[3:18:16] <ihavesillyknees> Maybe
[3:18:16] <Zuzu_Pachulia> Is Spellbreak still a thing?
[3:18:17] <%BoxNavy> no yes no yes no
[3:18:19] <+Goufed> You can turn off squad fill
[3:18:21] <johndoe0920> duos is permanent.
[3:18:22] <%Agami23> i wonder if totally accurate battlegrounds is still popular
[3:18:22] <LunarRemix> You can queue in solo but you play against teams, no?
[3:18:23] <invalid_robin> Hunt Showdown is a pretty good one of these
[3:18:24] <%LordSDB> They did solo for a bit, but didn't last long
[3:18:24] <+Ominnous> They're talking about Solo Queue @PatStaresAt
[3:18:24] <thatlolifrompersona1> It's 1v3
[3:18:26] <%hurricainejr> What about lawbreakers
[3:18:27] <%s_xylocalsingles> so 1v3v2v3v3v3
[3:18:28] <$RealThiele> one chat
[3:18:28] <$ItsRatman> You can play solo, but forced to fight other teams
[3:18:28] <+thelovingfool> @PatStaresAt it ques you into teame ques but you are solo
[3:18:28] <+flexin_apex> Duos and trios
[3:18:31] <KeiPrime> pour one out for Radical Heights
[3:18:32] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[3:18:32] <nauskills> You can solo queue but you may end up matching against trio
[3:18:32] <%saladin1911> Thanks chat NotLikeThis
[3:18:33] <LorcaNomad> that sucks
[3:18:34] <SpartanDumpster> @PatStaresAt the harpoon gun is less of a reliable and more for fishing, and can hurt builds pretty well.
[3:18:34] <%BoxNavy> thats terrible
[3:18:34] <Daxalog> Its solo for yourself. The other people still have teams.
[3:18:35] <masterfire23> you just have to 1v2 or 1v3
[3:18:36] <balthazar758> noyes
[3:18:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Why do you consistently ignore the fact that play Duos in Apex and it's basically solos. And yes, no-fill is permanent
[3:18:40] <ComancheNate> Darwin project was best br but it never really took off Sadge
[3:18:40] <%GarbageNirvana> That is literally putting yourself at a disadvantage
[3:18:44] <+VexicBayn> that's trash
[3:18:46] <millionstabz> Thats not real solos, idiots
[3:18:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> 1 v2 isn't that bad
[3:18:48] <ihavesillyknees> Why not just have solos? Does it make the game suck?
[3:18:50] <%AnIcedCoffee> @Zuzu_Pachulia Spellbreak is pretty barebones compared to other BRs
[3:18:50] <TheOmniSora> much more interesting than FFA
[3:18:51] <waffleandman> ok so no then not maybe just no
[3:18:52] <+dante_must_die_exe> I've got 3 Solo wins so far
[3:18:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> DUOS
[3:18:52] <+DeaconBluesClues> @PatStaresAt by that logic so are dark souls 3 invasions
[3:18:52] <Boxortoo> Chat. NotLikeThis
[3:18:53] <+RowenCleric> thats not solos chat...
[3:18:53] <%miguelrod777> why would they do taht
[3:18:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> HOLY SHIT
[3:18:54] <+AugustRei> lol that's awful
[3:18:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> DUOS
[3:18:56] <zamzoph> what about Hearthstone Battle Royale? Kappa
[3:18:56] <NinjaMii> Was gonna say theres no way there was actual solo
[3:18:57] <+Radkon> That's for streamers who are gods at the game
[3:19:03] <huskarl_zap> what about Tarkov?
[3:19:06] <ZeeJiggle> They should just add solo mode, but instead of the character powers, everyone's a titanfall 2 pilot. I solved it.
[3:19:12] <NOBLExGAMER> C'mon Pat don't you wanna play a competitive game at a disadvantage?
[3:19:12] <johndoe0920> No fill requires you to go against 2 and 3 man sqauds.
[3:19:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> 1 v 2 is just two 1 v 1 s
[3:19:15] <%AzureGale> Oh the new KOF XV is a surprise
[3:19:16] <%Agami23> i'd say its more accurate to say its like playing marvel with one character
[3:19:18] <ihavesillyknees> I don't understand why there're no solo in APEX
[3:19:23] <InfiniteAverage> this is where Predator hung out last season
[3:19:23] <Boxortoo> @PatStaresAt Fun fact, this area last season had a predator miniboss npc that could fuck your shit up pretty easily.
[3:19:29] <ComancheNate> what about a fighting game br
[3:19:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> Because it's an ability based game
[3:19:37] <%Jaxnos> chat isn't technically wrong on this one cuz the devs announced the feature as a solo mode when it's just a no-fill option to get yourself murdered with
[3:19:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> with squads
[3:19:40] <+flexin_apex> Remember whenrespawn did the 3rd person mode
[3:19:43] <$yeknomlive> they're called tournaments
[3:19:46] <mpo9> Oh this was were the predator was.
[3:19:48] <+MelodyMedley> you used to the fortifies then Pat?
[3:19:51] <+dante_must_die_exe> So when people are asking why no Solo que in Apex, do they mean FFA ?  I'm confused
[3:19:51] <%AzureGale> What about a wrestling game battle royale
[3:19:52] <%saladin1911> @keiganofastora Is that a joke? Solos and Duos are not the same thing.
[3:19:53] <mattdaddyd101> What about Hyperscape
[3:19:56] <+DeaconBluesClues> honestly I'd rather fight a team as solo. why would I share glory with some other loser when I can brag about killing an entire team of bad-at-video-games babies by myself
[3:19:59] <%코코꾸라> Now Lara Croft hangs here
[3:20:02] <NOBLExGAMER> Honestly it's like the Pokeman guy saying you can turn off XP Share by emptying your party
[3:20:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> 1v2 honestly isn't that hard if you're decent like pat is
[3:20:04] <%RadDude6969> Apex is part team based hero shooter so no solo makes sense, but it should still have it
[3:20:06] <TrixxImp> Firestorm atpRtsd
[3:20:08] <TheOmniSora> kid now goes reeeee
[3:20:09] <%Dunmarkh> gameplay
[3:20:09] <ihavesillyknees> What about Tetris battle royale?
[3:20:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> @saladin1911 Close enough
[3:20:16] <$RealThiele> gamers didnt rise up
[3:20:17] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Ginger Goblin Wipes Out Tomato Town, More at 11
[3:20:18] <%Broand> Wait if they went back in time how come all the temples are in ruins
[3:20:21] <sideoftacos> Wrestler BR and get thrown out the ring, literally
[3:20:25] <mpo9> Forza had a battle ryoal
[3:20:25] <%AzureGale> What about a Mario Battle Royale
[3:20:28] <mrshazboto> Since we're being big gamers - new fall guys stuff is fun
[3:20:29] <+archangel9889> @ihavesillyknees because the characters are built around co op
[3:20:29] <Deasmeister> Apex has support heros so it wouldn't make sense
[3:20:36] <+Radkon> Does fortnite have SBMM?
[3:20:38] <KeiPrime> the best kills are when you get someone with TTV in their name, but thats not limited to this game
[3:20:39] <NinjaMii> Oh right Lara Croft hangs around here now
[3:20:42] <%saladin1911> @keiganofastora "Close enough" is not the same thing. This is the fundamental issue lmao
[3:20:45] <Kief_Meister> @Deasmeister Ay yo whats up
[3:20:52] <%sleeplessmetro> I hate how much I want to play this now because of you Pat
[3:20:57] <ComancheNate> cancel halo infinite for...and get this... battle Royale
[3:21:04] <+dante_must_die_exe> Solo que in Apex is fine, I literally do not understand
[3:21:05] <Turf_Wind_and_Fire> Hey so I've had this on in the background and I think I missed it, but does Pat actually enjoy this?
[3:21:08] <+flexin_apex> Apex did solos a while back for limited event was ok
[3:21:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> @saladin1911 It's good enough but Pat's super picky with his games. It's good enough for me
[3:21:17] <%Necnill> sure
[3:21:19] <ihavesillyknees> I don't want to play Fortnite, but I will watch if Pat is playing it.
[3:21:20] <+JakeOfalco> think its predator
[3:21:20] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt Lol no this is where oyu would have killed predator to get him last season
[3:21:23] <%AzureGale> @turf_wind_and_fire Yes
[3:21:23] <%코코꾸라> No, it's Predator
[3:21:23] <$RealThiele> blue wuz here
[3:21:24] <+FishyLamar1> it will be soon raptors are coming
[3:21:27] <$KnivesEve> cant wait for pat to play ff7: Battle Royal
[3:21:31] <Brandon__Brando> @turf_wind_and_fire yes and he hate that he likes it
[3:21:31] <+perpetualpotionmachine> It's where Predator spawned
[3:21:35] <+dante_must_die_exe> @flexin_apex I am literally QUE'd for solo right now
[3:21:37] <Boxortoo> @PatStaresAt You fight predator in this area last season
[3:21:40] <%GalacticaPhanto> Pat should have taken the money Max declined to stream this
[3:21:41] <iosephe> pat stuck
[3:21:42] <mudapersona> sharks are still in the game?
[3:21:45] <swampwitch066> did u win pat?
[3:21:48] <NinjaMii> oh man watch em do jurassic park crossover
[3:21:51] <TrixxImp> Predator zone but no Alien zone atpFeelsBeardMan
[3:21:53] <+PolarBear1071> dante* "What the hell is this?"
[3:21:54] <+OmegaWeltall> he crankin 90's yet Kappa
[3:21:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> @dante_must_die_exe No you're not. I know what you mean but it's not solo mode. you're facing squads
[3:22:10] <$serpenttucker> @PatStaresAT what unique gimmicks do you think halo could bring to the BR genre, assuming there is any plans for it for infinite?
[3:22:11] <Jathspuh> i'll get you, bitch
[3:22:13] <Kief_Meister> @TrixxImp yeah you gotta pay asakuraFeelsTrunks asakuraFeelsTrunks asakuraFeelsTrunks asakuraFeelsTrunks asakuraFeelsTrunks asakuraFeelsTrunks
[3:22:15] <+DeaconBluesClues> this looks how I think dreamworks execs think video games look like
[3:22:16] <Turf_Wind_and_Fire> @AzureGale @Brandon__Brando Oh nice. Honestly, I get that everyone hates the hype but I have a bunch of friends who still enjoy the hell out of this game. I don't get the big deal either way to be honest.
[3:22:16] <+dante_must_die_exe> @KeiganOfAstora So you mean FFA, not solo que.
[3:22:23] <PartyFavors> @NinjaMii don't be silly; it'll be a Jurassic *World* crossover
[3:22:33] <$yeknomlive> was taht strider?
[3:22:34] <+flexin_apex> Yup it’s 1v3
[3:22:37] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Is the story mode for this good at all? It looked fun when they first showed off some teasers but I've never bothered to pick this game up
[3:22:42] <LunarRemix> @dante_must_die_exe When someone says solo what they mean is FFA.
[3:22:46] <huskarl_zap> violence house
[3:22:47] <+dante_must_die_exe> There's a BIG BIG difference between solo que and free-for-all gang
[3:22:50] <%saladin1911> @keiganofastora ... right
[3:22:52] <Boxortoo> f
[3:22:53] <%CainBelmont> CainBelmont subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 51 months! Oh shit
[3:22:55] <%linSP> lmao
[3:22:57] <nekrabeats> the big abuse house
[3:22:59] <$RealThiele> yea apex 'solo' que mode is just be a shitty team unto yourself

[3:23:23] <%bapposbungers> Good try.
[3:23:29] <LorcaNomad> you started looting while they were still shooting you pat LUL
[3:23:33] <NinjaMii> @partyfavors Ah yeah you’re right but either way I expect dinosaurs eventually since Lara is in this game

[3:23:47] <%Broand> man they're really trying to legitimize their OC huh
[3:23:47] <LunarRemix> Oh sometimes people will pretend to be NPCs, using a skin on a certain spot and pretend they're not players
[3:23:54] <FlamingNarwhal> @NinjaMii they were datamined already. raptors are coming for sure
[3:23:56] <plumsocks> is pat going to be a pro fortnite gamer?
[3:23:56] <+Freakin_Wolfy> pat you ever played PUBG?
[3:23:57] <Brandon__Brando> I don't know how you can aim that good with a controler once I move to mouse and keyboard I lost all my skill on a controller
[3:24:04] <@SoFarFetched> Pats playing Fortnite as part of his checking out "building games" genre.
[3:24:05] <$Gehtingsberg> What is happening?? Is this a dream? I just joined lol

[3:24:50] <%bapposbungers> @PatStaresAt Are you at least having fun?
[3:24:52] <$RealThiele> the real bitch would be to make npcs spawn dynamically to flush players out
[3:24:53] <ZeroCruz> This is surreal
[3:24:57] <+flexin_apex> @sofarfetched Lol
[3:24:57] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I have tiny baby hands so a controller is better for me
[3:24:57] <+BlockingDisabled> I can't wait to play Fortnite man in Smash! HahaBall

[3:25:31] <+Maxthetics> @s1rcuit Yeah but it's not free
[3:25:35] <ComancheNate> honestly kinda surprised they haven't come out with material skins yet
[3:25:35] <GeltonZ> @s1rcuit Yup but you still gotta buy it. They call it "Save the World"
[3:25:36] <Boxortoo> @s1rcuit It's still around, just more or less in maint mode
[3:25:37] <+Freakin_Wolfy> @SoFarFetched is that real? that souds lke him

[3:25:45] <DianaTheAscian> wow
[3:25:47] <Mvrdok_> Can't buy it anymore
[3:25:48] <%juxtest> The Spire npc killed me in my first match
[3:25:49] <NOBLExGAMER> I think it's safe to say Pat is a Pro Fortnite Gamer
[3:25:51] <Jathspuh> dayuum
[3:25:55] <$RealThiele> kick those nasty thoughts
[3:26:00] <Lord_Magtok> This would be a nice place to put the Necronomicon for the inevitable Evil Dead crossover.
[3:26:05] <swampwitch066> i think all pat is fighting is bots
[3:26:11] <s1rcuit> thanks guys, I bought it ages ago, but haven't played in years
[3:26:15] <+Radkon> Damn you get XP for everything huh
[3:26:21] <$yeknomlive> if it wasnt for the building stuff id be so much more into this game.
[3:26:25] <$Afterman_> pat rly should try out hunting grounds
[3:26:29] <NOBLExGAMER> I want Pat's Icon Skin to be him in his Gamer Cube
[3:26:30] <T_Sasquatch> Does it feel good to not know if your killing bots or real people ? :) fuck i hate this trend in games
[3:26:30] <DianaTheAscian> whats gold for anyway?
[3:26:35] <Boxortoo> @Radkon You can sneeze irl and get xp for it ingame lol
[3:26:37] <Kief_Meister> @Radkon Bro you breathe enough you get XP
[3:26:38] <TrixxImp> @swampwitch066 Nah usually bots tend to have some generic name with two numbers at the end, he's killed a good bit of players
[3:26:41] <LunarRemix> @Lord_Magtok I think they have a Ash vs The evil dead skin
[3:26:44] <s1rcuit> so I was away for a bit, how's he doing?
[3:26:45] <FlamingNarwhal> @DianaTheAscian buying things from npcs
[3:27:00] <NOBLExGAMER> @DianaTheAscian It's money basically.
[3:27:00] <DianaTheAscian> k
[3:27:04] <%Cykron> Oh god hes doing it
[3:27:07] <KeiPrime> yeah this game is pure dopamine, everything gives you number to make your number big
[3:27:10] <Lord_Magtok> Of course they do, christ.
[3:27:10] <Boxortoo> @DianaTheAscian you can trade it for gear or bodyguards in the form of those npcs that walk around. They're for "bounties" or some shit
[3:27:15] <+Maxthetics> Who else here is in the 'actually enjoys fortnite despite being into CSB' crowd
[3:27:19] <T_Sasquatch> !uptime
[3:27:19] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 27m.
[3:27:25] <%Cykron> He's beginning to believe
[3:27:25] <%saladin1911> @t_sasquatch There is zero satisfaction LUL
[3:27:31] <balthazar758> he doin' it
[3:27:32] <FlamingNarwhal> @Maxthetics this guy. Its a fun time
[3:27:34] <LunarRemix> Fortnite's legit fun
[3:27:37] <TrixxImp> The battle pass leveling is the best and most satisfying system in any game with a battlepass
[3:27:40] <@SoFarFetched> @Freakin_Wolfy yeah he was checking out Satisfactory,factorio the other week. Got hooked on Satisfactory so now he wanted to try Fortnite.
[3:27:43] <Boxortoo> I play fortnite with my nephew but that's about it really.
[3:27:51] <lonosi55> Just you
[3:27:52] <+aogman> @Maxthetics i'm in the 'actually enjoys fortnite despite being into CBT' crowd
[3:27:53] <Turf_Wind_and_Fire> @Maxthetics More in the adjacent "I don't get the immense amount of hate" group but I'll throw my hat in too, sure.
[3:27:56] <NinjaMii> I like Fortnite OSFrog
[3:27:57] <NOBLExGAMER> @Maxthetics Me
[3:27:58] <DudeDern> Fortnite is a solid game without glaring problems, enjoy what you want people
[3:28:03] <$yeknomlive> im glad pat's streaming it because he has a similar perspective the game as me and im curious what's actually in this game
[3:28:04] <+BigChiefBear> Blink 5 times really big if epic has a gun yo your head right now
[3:28:13] <balthazar758> i have nothing against this game. seems fun
[3:28:19] <%ThiccZilla> ThiccZilla subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! With Peach having her own stream room now will your schedules clash or you still gonna stream at seperate times?
[3:28:21] <+mcburgers3000> I could never get into the building stuff. But I understand the appeal of Fortnite
[3:28:22] <Brandon__Brando> Im thinking about downloading this didn't know all this extra stuff was added
[3:28:27] <+Maxthetics> Fortnite makes an EXCELLENT podcast game imo
[3:28:34] <T_Sasquatch> I don't hate fortnite but its building mechanic simply is not for me and I dont like its shooting in general. Also its a battle royale ResidentSleeper
[3:28:34] <FlamingNarwhal> fortnites biggest issue is Epic being a shit company. as a game itself its pretty great
[3:28:45] <$RealThiele> chugalug
[3:28:46] <+GarouFGC> First of all, I'm amazed this isn't some weird fever dream to begin with, Second of all. Pat playing with out the Ryu skin?
[3:28:51] <%Cozy90> i left for awhile. did anything cool happen?
[3:28:57] <Kief_Meister> If you could drink shields while running, games instantly better
[3:28:58] <+Maxthetics> You just mute whatever you're listening to if you make it like top 5 so you can concentrate but otherwise you just play real passively
[3:28:59] <NinjaMii> @mcburgers3000 I just don’t build. The enemies do it for me TPFufun
[3:29:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Douse yourself in the gamer dew
[3:29:09] <@PeachSaliva> @Cozy90 Pat showed his butt, it was incredible
[3:29:12] <NOBLExGAMER> I can't wait for the dedicated CSB Fortnite podcast
[3:29:13] <Turf_Wind_and_Fire> Remember this game had a single player campaign when it launched? LUL
[3:29:13] <+mental_mashup> I wanna chug jug with pat and be pro fortnite gamers
[3:29:18] <%Frodiddly> how much chicken did you have Pat
[3:29:19] <yiff_breaker> is this because of the meme song
[3:29:20] <boogerxboss> lmao what timeline is this
[3:29:24] <T_Sasquatch> I played the cod battle royale for a long time then uninstalled it because its like over 200 gb for one game
[3:29:25] <+applefibs> the building mechanic seems really neat, seems interesting to learn how to build ***
[3:29:25] <%Frodiddly> I was also gone for a while

[3:36:43] <Lord_Magtok> Always fun passing through an abandoned battlefield full of dead guy leftovers
[3:36:43] <+Maxthetics> Fair enough but they're good if you get a hand for them. I dunno about using them with a controller though.

[3:51:59] <%YakumoYomi> That tech support stream was pretty dope, tho

[3:52:54] <Broken_Sonex> @turf_wind_and_fire Yeah, i think that's intentional.
[3:53:01] <DianaTheAscian> I wonder when Paige will stream again

[4:03:05] <+squathoot> sad I missed doctor doom honestly
[4:03:06] <Boxortoo> @BoxNavy Nah, battlepass stuff stays to the battlepass. @PatStaresAt They accidentally did it once with a pet that looked almost identical to one in the battlepass, got removed a day later. Also more recently with a music track being sold in the store a few days ago on accident.
[4:03:09] <splinter1619> modern warfare also did it, I missed out on price :(
[4:03:10] <balthazar758> i hate videogames. but I love videogames.
[4:03:20] <GoDZooKii> I expect you start every stream now flossing.

[4:03:24] <LoneFonte> no
[4:03:25] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt they made smurfing a bannable offense in DOTA2
[4:03:26] <%BoxNavy> thats wack
[4:03:32] <sweettalker_> Pat don't, they're leveraging your emotions against you to wring money out of you.
[4:03:37] <ThirdPersonPhil> Can i just buy Raven or do i need to do the battle pass thing?
[4:03:40] <%SaiyanShoto> Is Pat the new ninja?
[4:03:42] <Jathspuh> nyanners monkaS
[4:03:46] <%Broand> Broand subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Hey pat, I knew a kid who played fortnite, he bought a skin every day for at least 2 years on his moms credit card and he was in high school.His eyes went super wide when I asked him if he ever used those skins because it turns out he hardly ever did.
[4:03:46] <%W1nterTitan> Yeah just today
[4:03:49] <%ssjklyco> No one plays DOTA 2 anyway
[4:03:51] <Boxortoo> @ThirdPersonPhil Battlepass only

[4:04:20] <KeiPrime> denying is fun
[4:04:24] <extradopeness> Denial
[4:04:25] <Boxortoo> denying is a dota thing yeah. It's fucking dumb.
[4:04:30] <+Drspiderskull92> Pat's bank account senses great danger coming
[4:04:32] <%Boxortoo> Boxortoo subscribed with Prime. 
[4:04:35] <GoDZooKii> @leinadtonu Smurf yeah lets Smurf in the parking lot later.

[4:05:06] <extradopeness> Dota* fuck
[4:05:07] <@SoFarFetched> Look if you can play Fortnite,you can play Chaos Legion.
[4:05:08] <pally_din> @VirtuaRailith Lich doesn't have that anymore
[4:05:12] <balthazar758> you did it pat. you cracked all the 90s
[4:05:21] <T_Sasquatch> YOU ARE WRONG

[4:05:28] <%hurricainejr> 4tnite
[4:05:30] <%AlteisenReiseZ> psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong
[4:05:31] <Press_X_ToJASON> what about a city margin
[4:05:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Apex is better
[4:05:33] <Zebens> LUL
[4:05:34] <jorniev> NO WONDER ITS SO POPULAR
[4:05:35] <GoDZooKii> You take that back while APEX is around sir!
[4:05:41] <%Boxortoo> @Superblooms The BR mode saved fortnite because epic shit the bed with the lootbox shit in STW.
[4:05:41] <$KnivesEve> tetris 99 is better
[4:05:50] <+LionheartMD> Still think Warzone has the best gunplay of them
[4:05:54] <%sleeplessmetro> fight fight fight
[4:05:55] <s1rcuit> can't you though?
[4:05:55] <jorniev> THERE IT IS
[4:05:56] <%the38bandit> u can
[4:05:56] <%barkon345> better then blackout or warzone?
[4:05:57] <Kief_Meister> nah Apex is just flat out better lmao
[4:05:57] <Press_X_ToJASON> yeah, only thing in Apex's way
[4:05:57] <Jaketify> thats fair
[4:05:59] <%Monkeyweed21> Have friends loser
[4:06:00] <Apolonm> No
[4:06:04] <+DrGrudge> that's it?
[4:06:04] <DianaTheAscian> its so weird that they haven't made a solo mode
[4:06:05] <+Blucarot> you can now
[4:06:05] <Zebens> just que and have no one be on you team
[4:06:06] <BlindGato> You CAN
[4:06:06] <dK_kay> kinda true
[4:06:10] <GoDZooKii> Nope.
[4:06:13] <%Frodiddly> where's the lie
[4:06:15] <Darkdrill> the devs said no
[4:06:17] <scht3v3> There’s an option to not fill teammates
[4:06:18] <BlindGato> You can do that now
[4:06:18] <Press_X_ToJASON> you can't regularly enough
[4:06:20] <HaroldDonchee> inb4 pat gets super into fortnite and puts on a delay to stop stream sniping
[4:06:21] <jorniev> MAKE YOUR FRIENDS KILL THEMSELVES
[4:06:24] <%saladin1911> Not 1v2 chat. God damn you silly people lmfao
[4:06:25] <+SuperFineButtHairs> the most correct Pat has ever been
[4:06:25] <%Boxortoo> @DianaTheAscian They did a solo mode once for a limited time, most fun I ever had with apex honestly.
[4:06:28] <Darkdrill> but you can 1 vs 2
[4:06:28] <Press_X_ToJASON> I tried to last week, it's not a mode
[4:06:30] <+Psifonian> Hi Pat :)
[4:06:31] <RetributionP> what why fortnight welp back to the ff15 pat streams
[4:06:32] <GoDZooKii> I can make it a solo
[4:06:34] <@SoFarFetched> Also your teammates just leave you behind.
[4:06:34] <%the38bandit> i kinda find it fun
[4:06:37] <%BigCoffee> sure, queue solo and ditch the other 2 bozos :p
[4:06:37] <%sleeplessmetro> here we gooooo
[4:06:40] <mudapersona> just make Paige and Plague play
[4:06:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Make friends lol
[4:06:41] <BlindGato> it is get good :)
[4:06:41] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[4:06:42] <Darkdrill> there is a 1 VS 2 mode
[4:06:42] <BigLoserJosh> yeah no, No Fill in trios is not viable
[4:06:43] <extradopeness> He’s right
[4:06:43] <$hatesdps> get friends play apex
[4:06:44] <%kyh9> Fortnite legit feels like Smash to me, down to the casual-friendly randomness
[4:06:46] <Zebens> it's a challenege
[4:06:46] <scht3v3> Just get good tho
[4:06:46] <jorniev> i still agree with pat
[4:06:46] <sweettalker_> Breaking news: man owns self by discovering popular video game to actually be good.
[4:06:49] <Hanzmolman> Duos are fun
[4:06:49] <%Broand> It's weird because it'd totally make some of the characters entirely irrelevant
[4:06:51] <jorniev> YUP
[4:06:54] <%AncelDeLambert> you're still 1v3 if you do that
[4:06:56] <BigLoserJosh> No fill in duos? Maybe you can do it
[4:06:57] <Superblooms> @Superblooms i get it but it still hurts
[4:07:10] <Omega1180> you mean fre for all
[4:07:14] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I agree with Pat
[4:07:16] <%Monkeyweed21> play with a friend or 2
[4:07:16] <Press_X_ToJASON> it's not a solo queue AND it sucks for your teammates
[4:07:20] <jorniev> I WOULD also prefer a mode thats solo
[4:07:21] <%Broand> Pathfinder only mode
[4:07:21] <LoneFonte> @Omega1180 yeah.
[4:07:22] <mudapersona> Apex would be horrible solo the amount of 3rd partying in that game already is nosense
[4:07:25] <mrshazboto> Solo in duos is basically solo que if you're bad enough and it matchmakes you with other bads
[4:07:25] <$hatesdps> that
[4:07:26] <%cvp5127> wall running
[4:07:28] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt Nah bro thats called Titanfall 2
[4:07:28] <%kyh9> "I want a generic character that is of this class"
[4:07:29] <Kief_Meister> YEAH
[4:07:29] <ThirdPersonPhil> its even worse than running from your teammates cause they might revive out of spite.
[4:07:30] <+Drspiderskull92> I wish I didn't have to pay for all the characters in Apex
[4:07:32] <%Monkeyweed21> stim
[4:07:34] <+luketrapwalker> THANK YOU
[4:07:34] <bonebagMEL> you want TF3, we know
[4:07:34] <Darkdrill> apex is great now
[4:07:36] <$hatesdps> also sounds awesome
[4:07:39] <%Boxortoo> @Superblooms I know, I went hard into STW during alpha and for like the first year of it's beta til BR came and steamrolled any chance of any updates for it.
[4:07:40] <T_Sasquatch> A titanfall battle royale would be brutal
[4:07:42] <extradopeness> No fill is not the same
[4:07:42] <DianaTheAscian> idk why chat keeps trying to convince Pat with these crappy wanna be "solo modes"
[4:07:42] <%AncelDeLambert> hopefully they'll have the budget soon to make a Titanfall 3
[4:07:43] <%Fooguwu> titanfall would be such an incredible BR
[4:07:43] <aiutare47> Yeah
[4:07:44] <$KnivesEve> just make titanfall 3 pls
[4:07:46] <+Psifonian> He speak the tru tru
[4:07:47] <%kyh9> Titanfall is dead, you need to move on
[4:07:49] <GoDZooKii> If it was solo every one would be Pathfinder.
[4:07:49] <+OrangeMDT> That’s not generic then
[4:07:49] <sweettalker_> Pat, come back to titanfall... please... our community is dying
[4:07:52] <mrshazboto> Just play Octane forehead
[4:07:52] <+Blucarot> how about we just get titanfall 3
[4:07:53] <Kief_Meister> I JUST WANT TITANFALL 3 MAN...JUST GIVE ME TITANFALL 3 PLEASE GOD
[4:08:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> So, get ganked in 6 seconds rather than 10. Got it
[4:08:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Man, wouldn't Apex be cool if you could have a giant robot? Too bad they never made a game like that :)
[4:08:12] <Kief_Meister> @kyh9 no...me and 4000 other people keep it alive asakuraFeelsTrunks asakuraFeelsTrunks asakuraFeelsTrunks asakuraFeelsTrunks asakuraFeelsTrunks asakuraFeelsTrunks asakuraFeelsTrunks
