[0:03:36] <%Dementedpenguin> Finally, TEPPEN 2 Kappa
[0:03:37] <$Kurokoi64> By all means itd be a mistake to announce SF6. The last dlc for 5 was released what... a month ago?
[0:03:41] <%Jhylla81> Seriously though, it'd be a logistic nightmare but I'd love a modern console port/uprez of Tech Romancer and/or Red Earth/Warzard
[0:03:46] <%TheREALGirthMan> Shit I just realized the mech has Crazy Talk's mouthpiece
[0:03:49] <Themostdelicious> FLY INTO FREE
[0:03:51] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Slim_Lipid finally, someone else who knows that game exists
[0:03:57] <%Scoobles64> Scoobles64 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Forgot I'm auto subbed to because I always watch your vods, keep up the good work and geif kisses. I hope dudley shows up in the base roster if this is sf6, what would be your wishes for the roster? who do you not want to see? (not allowed to say luke)
[0:04:02] <Snektor> I know it wont...but please let it be Dino Crisis Remake...pls pls
[0:04:02] <%Jhylla81> I honestly don't understand why Red Earth has NEVER been put on any console
[0:04:03] <+SinistersQuest> New mega man X or we riot.
[0:04:04] <KermitgelionUnit01> The game is Street Fighter 6, but you fight streets and the main character's name is 6.
[0:04:04] <WSintai> Time for them to delete a bunch of anticipated games live on stream!
[0:04:14] <+razielhex> NOT BUSCEMI
[0:04:21] <%Buttlo> @Kurokoi64 They openly said Luke was going to be the final character and that season 6 only happened because Covid pushed everything back.
[0:04:24] <@Ranryu692> is the music particularly low for anyone else? I've been having speaker trouble recently and can't tell which end it's on
[0:04:27] <%OrangeMDT> Man, Pat is really going for this when Max has 27k viewers psaCaw
[0:04:29] <$J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Would be awesome if there was one more than one announced thing, but it‚Äôll probably just be one thing that leaves tons of people disappointed
[0:04:29] <%RD_NX> psaGib STREET FIGHTER
[0:04:30] <$Pompadourius> I've now realized that there's always the 1% chance it's Dragon's Dogma 2 and I will now be disappointed when it's not. LUL
[0:04:33] <%DianaTheAscian> The font of the countdown is weird for  SF
[0:04:33] <%hax_metatron> hax_metatron subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 19 month streak! BINGO
[0:04:36] <PizzicatoFive5> it's Steve Buscemi!!
[0:04:38] <+poordoughboy> whoa, daddy!
[0:04:44] <+hiswill98> What‚Äôs the exact time of the announcement?
[0:04:46] <truelifedood300> is it in an hour and a half?
[0:04:47] <Drchandragupta> Gonna sound a but crazy here but the intro of version of paige gives me weird Eldar vibes
[0:04:52] <%MonsterEnvy> Along with Street Fighter, I am hoping maybe for Megaman but it's not likely.
[0:04:53] <%Quigsies> DARTH PAT

[1:11:32] <fojidoj> Could be the first good looking SF since third strike
[1:11:32] <%Keyd00d> my favorite...
[1:11:33] <+michingmallecho> How come when Capcom presents Resident evil, it's way better
[1:11:33] <DusK_The_Stray> He looks a little bit better until he fucking flexed his gross muscle arm
[1:11:33] <Louie_Salmon> Well that was just CG so who knows what look it will have
