[0:03:21] <Jaysky> @Ranryu692 My standard emotes like :) are super tiny but everything else is the same size
[0:03:25] <%jtdobyns> @mikesumusprime congrats haha
[0:03:33] <SkinnyRite> Thane recruit
[0:03:39] <jackelzxaa> i'm only 1 part of catchup away from having seen everything so far (i was here for part of that stream but missed some of it)
[0:03:41] <Saltmeisterr> its putruck
[0:03:48] <jackelzxaa> thane is the hottest character model in the game
[0:03:48] <%maenos2> @josef_stryker on second set of recruitment, just got tali
[0:03:51] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> I just got here, when did Pat start
[0:03:56] <jackelzxaa> and the best character model bioware ever made in general
[0:03:58] <~PatStaresAt> like 4 minutes ago
[0:04:03] <%Ranryu692> @ThatWeirdGuyFromWork he hasn't yet
[0:04:03] <slandracon> hello, where's the goblin?
[0:04:04] <~PatStaresAt> you still got 6 minutes of intro shenanigans
[0:04:07] <jackelzxaa> he looks so fucking good
[0:04:13] <+drakthebest> Has Pat heard of Ender Lillies? It came out of early access today
[0:04:17] <%Taisuru> IT'S HIM, IT'S THE ROUND MAN AND HIS GLASS WIFE
[0:04:17] <~PatStaresAt> no
[0:04:19] <~PatStaresAt> gimme a second
[0:04:28] <+drakthebest> Castlevania Stand Game
[0:04:30] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> @PatStaresAt Oh okay good, I don't get to catch these live so I'm happy to be here
[0:04:34] <dubstep_paladin> Pat dont leave us
[0:04:49] <jackelzxaa> i just realised how is it that pat falls down during the intro and not paige
[0:04:53] <Josef_Stryker> Do u think there's a good reason to pick up the Legendary Edition if I already have the Trilogy on PC with mods?
[0:04:57] <%SpontaneousC> SpontaneousC subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Wooh five months! Pet the babies and keep Paige in bubble wrap to prevent any more broken lamps
[0:05:10] <jackelzxaa> yeah Legendary Edition has alot of changes to all 3 games that mods can't do
[0:05:12] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> Man I
[0:05:15] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> oops
[0:05:24] <jackelzxaa> ME1 LE is a flat out improvement over even what mods can do for that game
[0:05:27] <%dekkitout> Is this Legend of the Hidden Temple?
[0:05:32] <jackelzxaa> the texture upscaling is also better all around
[0:05:44] <SkinnyRite> Paige is Tali and Tali is Paige, but which one is the coke bottle?
[0:05:55] <jackelzxaa> me2 and 3 also better integrate the dlc so you have to actually go and buy or research the guns and armor instead of just getting 30 guns at the start of the game every time
[0:06:23] <jackelzxaa> me1 makes the mako WAY better and makes the gun aiming not shit for unspecialized classes, among other things (a few fixes all over, too and a better lighting engine)
[0:06:32] <%Valdorick> Valdorick subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! Pet da baby
[0:06:33] <Sol_Install> yoyo
[0:06:34] <+even_the_yuenglings> man me3 in the LE is so much better than I remember how it was at release
[0:06:42] <jackelzxaa> also your face doesnt fucking break when you get to me3 like in the original game
[0:06:51] <~PatStaresAt> Are you guys ready
[0:06:54] <~PatStaresAt> for a SPECIAL THING
[0:06:59] <Josef_Stryker> Speaking of vehicles, the Hammerhead is a piece of crap. Sure it controls great but it feels like a wet tissue box.
[0:07:02] <IntenseNerdRage> no
[0:07:04] <OldManDeckardCain> no
[0:07:05] <~PatStaresAt> oh okay
[0:07:12] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> I like things..
[0:07:14] <dj_arashi_rora> maybe
[0:07:16] <MoonlitWispy> no sorry pat
[0:07:16] <The_Oxford_Comma> you are a special thing to me, pat
[0:07:16] <%HairballCT> detuneEyes
[0:07:19] <%dekkitout> Can the special thing be three hours of gief cam SeriousSloth
[0:07:22] <IntenseNerdRage> I refuse to be ready
[0:07:22] <jackelzxaa> i unironically think the changes they made to the mako are better than the me2 hammerhead
[0:07:23] <+drakthebest> in before camera opens to a close up of zangief's empty balls
[0:07:23] <+Rachet20> Yes?
[0:07:27] <Zeif00> Pat you're on scrubquotes by proxy
[0:07:27] <SaltyDavid> Define special
[0:07:30] <%NateyBeak> disk room
[0:07:31] <+wehateanime> i hope the special thing is a big cookie
[0:07:37] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> LeRouch_the_Rebel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Is the special surprise that you're a furry now?
[0:07:38] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> @PatStaresAt I dunno dude this already feels special I've only done streams before once for like twenty minutes
[0:07:38] <%cvp5127> egg pat
[0:07:39] <%Mr_Pylon> I'd take a bog standard thing
[0:07:39] <jackelzxaa> giving the mako a boost button, weight, and better stats just makes it work much better
[0:07:40] <SkinnyRite> MrDestructoid
[0:07:44] <%condemned_15> Is Paige preggors?
[0:07:45] <~PatStaresAt> wait how am i on scrubquotes by proxy
[0:07:50] <%Archphronimos> I'm ready probably
[0:07:51] <%DianaTheAscian> IS PAIGE FAKE PREGNANT? AGAIN?
[0:07:52] <jackelzxaa> i think the hammerhead is a little better shielded in LE, too?
[0:07:57] <%patriotrenegade> patriotrenegade subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! OVer the course of quarantine
[0:08:09] <%Vibe__Lord> pat Is defo pregnant
[0:08:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Paige is Defo Preggs
[0:08:12] <$BlackMage66652> Gief is pregnant!
[0:08:13] <IntenseNerdRage> if it isn't a bigger pat eating the smaller pat, then I want my money back
[0:08:13] <%Dfreddy8> Are you on the toilet again?
[0:08:17] <+LazyAss24Seven> What did Paige break this time? nliWHAT
[0:08:17] <+victhebeard> Paige is real fake pregnant now?
[0:08:18] <%patriotrenegade> well whatever then
[0:08:18] <Josef_Stryker> Can the Hammerhead actually take hits in ME2LE?
[0:08:21] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> @PatStaresAt And I've been watching since the Machinima days
[0:08:24] <Afterman_> elmo is preggers with gief babies
[0:08:28] <%Taisuru> IT'S TIME
[0:08:29] <morningmoondude> FTRs wrestling so i'll look away until a better match is on
[0:08:29] <%greasypete00> he's changing his diaper
[0:08:31] <jackelzxaa> i wish hammerhead had been properly designed and integrated into missions and planets like the mako was, and that me3 had a vehicle because that game is a war game and it'd be rad to be on uncharted worlds with reapers stomping around
[0:08:33] <fuji_n2> the surprise is gonna be the drops innit
[0:08:37] <bob900000> yoooo
[0:08:37] <%Arazien> Is it the drops?

[0:08:46] <Zeif00> @PatStaresAt remember your post about Nemy's m2 and the speed boost survivors get and somebody replies saying all killers should be brought down 5-10% speed?
[0:08:47] <catwithsunglasses> are we getting a confirmation on if Gief's nut blanket is preggers?

[0:51:09] <%dekkitout> Fov could use a bump up but I can dig it
[0:51:27] <%doctordinkus> woolie bait
[0:51:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie would love this
[0:51:34] <%Ranryu692> so did Woolie make this game, or was it just made FOR him?
[0:51:35] <DanThePumpkinman> Woolie would LOVE this game
[0:51:39] <TioXyco> is this first person Spelunky?
[0:51:40] <%StaceMcGate> missed a treasure tho

[0:51:53] <notsoy> a grappling hook to betray humanity for...again
[0:51:54] <+OhioNitsud> he'll play when its not cool to
[0:51:56] <%dekkitout> Would he play if it had cyberpunk neon aesthetic?
[0:51:57] <%BoxNavy> woolie HATES it
[0:51:58] <Profmcstevie> The Woolie bait has been pouring out this E3
[0:51:58] <+TopTieramisu> woolie will get to it... when no one's playing it
[0:51:59] <+zsDirtyHarry> rbeeMotiv
[0:51:59] <%NateyBeak> he'll try to play it in 12 years when the servers are down
[0:52:00] <%Dementedpenguin> If you say Woolie will love this, he'll play it in 10 years.
[0:52:00] <Louie_Salmon> Maybe in 20 years or so
[0:52:01] <Pookiedaexzile> He will "get" around to it by the time its on phones
[0:52:01] <%xmetalicdemonx> or just wait a couple years before playing it
[0:52:02] <DSD24> Woah this looks familiar
[0:52:02] <%Spydurman> Woolie would love it too much for him to play it
[0:52:03] <%fat_burtreynolds> big Woooahment
[0:52:03] <%baka_sugoi> B L E S S
[0:52:03] <Blank9> he'll play it in 9 months, for a quick look done with a controller/keyboard hybrid on a bad port

[0:52:06] <%Chichen> heal
[0:52:06] <BigYanno> the fastest way to get Woolie to never play a game is to tell him he'll love it
[0:52:07] <Dragovus> Woolie is not a fan of First Person
[0:52:07] <Djinnazz> HEAL
[0:52:08] <%Garthunox> Pat you missed the krogan vitality upgrade

[0:52:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> You'll tell Woolie about this, and then he'll play it two years from now and act like he learned about it himself.
[0:52:39] <%Monkeyweed21> reminder that Woolie has yet to beat Hades once
[0:52:41] <Louie_Salmon> More like Shitty of Ass

[0:54:49] <%NopeBadguy> YO WORLD FIRST

[0:55:11] <Psyramics> isn't that how this game works? if you beat it you will be the only one who ever will

[0:58:26] <%BoxNavy> +1 for realism
[0:58:28] <OldManDeckardCain> THE MORE YOU KNOW
[0:58:30] <%derpy_platypus> ngl I've run into a metal pipe and almost died
[0:58:32] <+Buzzkill983> Sharpness exists regardless of movement
[0:58:33] <+zsDirtyHarry> running into metal blades is a failure of the game designer
[0:58:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat is a dog rat.
[0:58:34] <rufus2k2> I just claimed Purple Twitch Whip! Thanks for the Drops @PatStaresAt
[0:58:37] <%dekkitout> Can you anchor the ceiling?
[0:58:37] <%MelBrooksKA> Okay Paige
[0:58:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Fellas if you stop a sharp will it still hurt you
[0:58:42] <danknugglit> Needs more research
[0:58:43] <%Valdorick> Instructions unclear, stuck my dick into a sawblade
[0:58:44] <%fat_burtreynolds> OMNI blade
[0:58:45] <%Mattais88> I always think those designs beside the You're Dead screen are the SGEA logo.
[0:58:46] <%StaceMcGate> ah. so this temple has 5 stages
[0:58:48] <charrchord> What would I do without Pat's wisdom
[0:58:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> AND WE ALL LIFT
[0:58:53] <andoowhy> I can see this as a side-mode in warframe
[0:58:56] <balthazar758> Indiana Gang
[0:58:59] <karovus> beat those dead ghosts to the treasure
[0:59:00] <ergulor> hahaha
[0:59:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> What was your plan
[0:59:00] <+Urgotfantasy> oh
[0:59:01] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[0:59:01] <%BoxNavy> so cool
[0:59:02] <%StaceMcGate> HE WAS THE COOLEST
[0:59:08] <+zsDirtyHarry> the whip is what makes this game imo
[0:59:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Good job
[0:59:13] <+bluedude153> OWNED
[0:59:13] <%BoxNavy> SO cool
[0:59:15] <%StaceMcGate> just the coolest
[0:59:16] <Djinnazz> LUL
[0:59:17] <+3amsoda> LUL
[0:59:17] <Profmcstevie> this will be an excellent phantom for people to watch
[0:59:17] <+black_pariah> why did yoy think that would work
[0:59:17] <%WhereIsWill> welp
[0:59:18] <LoneFonte> slow down pat
[0:59:18] <bobofgg6yb> oh
[0:59:26] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Pat's one weakness. Gravity
[0:59:29] <%MugenSandan> Biggest strongest ghost
[0:59:31] <%codedoomboy> Oh no
[0:59:32] <+TopTieramisu> yes
[0:59:33] <Louie_Salmon> @patstaresat Is there music on your end? Cuz stream can't hear any
[0:59:34] <%derpy_platypus> other players trigger traps
[0:59:35] <Malisin_Murder> monkaS
[0:59:35] <%Valdorick> LUL
[0:59:36] <%Ranryu692> theyve been opening chests for you
[0:59:36] <DanThePumpkinman> THE COOLEST FASTEST
[0:59:36] <+zsDirtyHarry> that was some fall guys shit
[0:59:38] <Vakojin> DIdn't you noticed with the chests ?
[0:59:40] <Wolfstriker121> oh damn lol
[0:59:42] <+TopTieramisu> the ghost's whip stopped the spinning blades, remember?
[0:59:43] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:59:46] <+3amsoda> LUL LUL LUL
[0:59:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, I think your problem is you're not going FAST ENOUGH.
[0:59:48] <Djinnazz> THE. COOLEST.
[0:59:49] <TioXyco> DETH
[0:59:50] <SaltyDavid> The ghosts WILL screw you
[0:59:50] <%StaceMcGate> the coolest, fastest ghost
[0:59:52] <%Taisuru> Remember that's hwo you found about stopping the blade
[0:59:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> AND WE ARE ALL ADRIFT
[0:59:53] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> that means it's multiplayer
[0:59:55] <jbrachob> its their fault you died
[0:59:57] <+Punchasaur> A floor is also a ceiling :)
[0:59:58] <%StaceMcGate> I'm crying a little
[0:59:58] <Wolfstriker121> there can be ONLY ONE!
[1:00:00] <rufus2k2> wait, so when does the actual whip come out?
[1:00:01] <%WhereIsWill> that changes things. they're actually there
[1:00:03] <Pookiedaexzile> IF YOU DIE IN THE GHOST YOU DIE IN REALLIFe
[1:00:04] <rufus2k2> cuz it ain't showing up
[1:00:06] <%BoxNavy> will we?
[1:00:07] <bobofgg6yb> the fallest of guys
[1:00:09] <%Nobrev> pat isnt that how you learned you could whip the blades to stop them
[1:00:11] <%dekkitout> So it's a strand game too
[1:00:13] <karovus> this time for sure
[1:00:15] <%NopeBadguy> @Punchasaur a ceiling is just a floor that's drunk
[1:00:15] <%MelBrooksKA> I can't believe how cool Pat's ghost is
[1:00:19] <%Taisuru> Does speed matter?
[1:00:19] <OldManDeckardCain> just like spelunky Kappa
[1:00:24] <%fat_burtreynolds> Ride wife
[1:00:24] <Profmcstevie> Winner Winner Indiana Chicken Dinner
[1:00:25] <Pookiedaexzile> This is a Strang type game
[1:00:26] <balthazar758> 👻
[1:00:27] <%fat_burtreynolds> Life good
[1:00:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Stand*
[1:00:32] <Zourath> Legend of the Hidden Fallguys
[1:00:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat trying to style with the whip
[1:00:41] <+TopTieramisu> it is basically 3d spelunky
[1:00:45] <thelonechris> This is just City of Brass
[1:00:46] <rufus2k2> Hermit Purple The Game
[1:01:04] <Pookiedaexzile> So we've already discovered the troll, get 3 health pips, and take out as many sqaures as possible
[1:01:05] <%StaceMcGate> Pat is playing like this game has a style meter
[1:01:09] <Pookiedaexzile> and fuck up a map
[1:01:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt GREEN BLOCKS WHIP
[1:01:20] <Malisin_Murder> LUL
[1:01:22] <LoneFonte> needs orb
[1:01:34] <%heartlesshealer> the key was left on your dead ghost I think
[1:01:34] <+Polarized_> did I miss the surprise?
[1:01:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> ORB
[1:01:38] <BigYanno> I just claimed Purple Twitch Whip! Thanks for the Drops @PatStaresAt
[1:01:43] <Slimshazbot> What's the incentive to sprint this and not take it slow?
[1:01:50] <balthazar758> hardcore parkour
[1:01:56] <Profmcstevie> yo yo yo pass me the rock
[1:01:58] <Zeif00> member wall
[1:01:58] <ToneBacas> so those player ghosts you see are from players who tried this level seed and died?
[1:02:09] <+TopTieramisu> @Slimshazbot not being a goober
[1:02:10] <LoneFonte> @Slimshazbot fake style points
[1:02:19] <dinnydanny777> 4Head
[1:02:22] <Malisin_Murder> I don't think that's what they meant
[1:02:26] <DanThePumpkinman> i kinda hate that ghosts can do stuff. seems like it'd be the worst to be really far on a run and lose to some ghost bullshit
[1:02:27] <+GenesisKnight> 4head
[1:02:28] <+zsDirtyHarry> What's the incentive to finish the game?
[1:02:28] <thelonechris> LUL
[1:02:30] <Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt But is it like, timed or anything?
[1:02:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat YOU JUST WALKED OFF
[1:02:31] <TourettesPlays> whats the point of jumping i dont get it
[1:02:32] <%Chichen> i'm sorry
[1:02:35] <%maenos2> smooth move exlax
[1:02:36] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @Slimshazbot someone could theoretically finish the temple while you're in it and kick you out
[1:02:39] <%Monkeyweed21> PAT WHY
[1:02:39] <OldManDeckardCain> why
[1:02:40] <%Varlinator> Pat.......
[1:02:40] <%ape_hawk> is the whip on a cooldown or can you spam it?
[1:02:41] <thelonechris> I'm not the one at the controls
[1:02:41] <Profmcstevie> Only one person can win a temple, sprint maintains zooming speed
[1:02:42] <dimensaur> I can't wait for speedruners to get a hold of this
[1:02:43] <%StaceMcGate> LUL
[1:02:46] <%heartlesshealer> Only one person gets to beat the thing
[1:02:48] <%BoxNavy> :)
[1:02:48] <+Polarized_> that "no" was legendary
[1:02:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Try jumping
[1:02:54] <%fat_burtreynolds> You can’t double whip back upV
[1:03:07] <+gitgouda> guess i got a drop? lol
[1:03:09] <dan_g_v> Pay to Skip
[1:03:11] <%heartlesshealer> pat opened his money door
[1:03:14] <thelonechris> Pay to skip
[1:03:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's the Baby Door
[1:03:24] <%dekkitout> Poison poison poison
[1:03:25] <dan_g_v> yep, we are getting purple whips!
[1:03:31] <%ape_hawk> yeah, big whoop, so can i?
[1:03:36] <Pookiedaexzile> And we never saw that temple again
[1:03:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Apparently the aztecks believe in pay to win
[1:03:58] <thelonechris> I thought those ghosts were other players and this was a battle royale-type thing
[1:04:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> Gas GAS GAS
[1:04:18] <%Nobrev> does this game have a proper release window or is it just early access for the forseeable future?
[1:04:21] <PhiloRobo> Is the Twitch whip just purple or does it do something the other whips don't?
[1:04:22] <%StaceMcGate> the fart gas chambers
[1:04:24] <Zebylth> GAS
[1:04:25] <+lazuli_alter> well technically yeah, they're other players who died before you
[1:04:27] <%Dementedpenguin> WutFace
[1:04:28] <dan_g_v> not gonna lie, I sometimes lean forward when Pat is doing his big jumps
[1:04:29] <%WhereIsWill> oh damn
[1:04:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Its dey Gas Man
[1:04:34] <Profmcstevie> The ghosts are the past players who failed it seems, and there can only be one person in the world to beat this mutation of the temple
[1:04:34] <LoneFonte> this game is pretty much Deathrun as a full game
[1:04:45] <+zsDirtyHarry> boy that whip is a fun mechanic
[1:04:46] <%weissguard> clempsPog Yo, now we're in the Hidden Temple
[1:04:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> HIDDEN TIMPLE
[1:04:58] <BigYanno> Area denial seems really brutal in this game
[1:04:59] <+lazuli_alter> yep, once one person finishes this, nobody else can play it again
[1:05:00] <%StaceMcGate> break pots
[1:05:10] <Profmcstevie> It's a grappling hook, masquerading as a whip
[1:05:15] <%BoxNavy> pat ur the gas man cus u fart all the time hahah only messing around :)
[1:05:18] <+tigerstyle96> Is this Temple Run?
[1:05:22] <%Dementedpenguin> Olmec don't hurt us WutFace
[1:05:24] <rufus2k2> @PatStaresAt did you see Gawr Gura got Vergil and Dante's VAs to celebrate her birthday?
[1:05:34] <+zsDirtyHarry> that roll is barf
[1:05:35] <%Nobrev> looks like you have to linger for it to hurt you or something
[1:05:39] <%StaceMcGate> you probably take damage if you stay in it

[1:07:05] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> I gotta know where did that super masculine sneeze come from
[1:07:06] <Terebad> No, but you can only whip them to open them if you get there first

[1:07:48] <Profmcstevie> Gravity? How dare
[1:07:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> you need to ROLL
[1:07:57] <thelonechris> Now scale up the wall with your leg bones sticking out

[1:18:45] <balthazar758> pat's legacy
[1:18:47] <HawkHollywood> just got here is this game essentially 3d spelunky?
[1:18:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Imagine you're a ghost demon spiirt and you see the asshole you're following run into a sword that isn't moving
[1:18:57] <%Nobrev> Don't worry only us 1,212 viewers saw @PatStaresAt
[1:18:59] <tanarath> 4at least 3 of these deaths were Pat, right?
[1:19:00] <%derpy_platypus> fall guys 2
[1:19:08] <%derpy_platypus> botch boogaloo
[1:19:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> @HawkHollywood This game is a LOT nicer than Spelunky.
[1:19:13] <%Dementedpenguin> Now I want a Sinistar mod with his voice screaming at you. LUL
[1:19:22] <%twistedj3ster> is there? It's pretty slow
[1:19:25] <%TheLemuroid> The movement looks like it feels good. That's a big plus.
[1:19:26] <+mcjimbo12> @tanarath nah you only get to try each layout once and then it's locked for you forever
[1:19:29] <%DedlokPM> GIRLS ARE WATCHING YOUR GHOST! RIGHT... NOW!
[1:19:33] <Pookiedaexzile> I want this in my pocket
[1:19:34] <HawkHollywood> @commandersqueaks got it
[1:19:37] <%dekkitout> Tons. All there needs to be are movement upgrades. Double jump, air dash, mid air anchors, swinging, etc
[1:19:46] <+Veraverse> The girls are watching
[1:19:51] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> how fast does it feel like you're going?
[1:19:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt How is this for an idea mario cart with ghost shit but each loopthe ghost are created and they repeat your past actions and it can EFFECT YOU
[1:19:53] <%BoxNavy> very good pat
[1:19:53] <%StaceMcGate> I guess keys will be the major monetization thing
[1:19:58] <%QueequegTheater> No red means fast
[1:19:59] <iamtheTwitchghost> i saw a float power in sonicfox's stream
[1:20:02] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> Like in Doom it feels REALLY fast
[1:20:03] <+mcjimbo12> @dekkitout yeah most of that stuff does exist you just have to unlock it
[1:20:15] <LoneFonte> there are movement upgrades
[1:20:19] <Profmcstevie> First Person Prince of Persia and all permutations will never be a bad concept for a video game
[1:20:19] <+chrispypopcorn> Game looks neat
[1:20:21] <TheMightyElosan> Can you walk run in this game?
[1:20:23] <+Rylention> Pat, some blessings can do other things than heal. Like give you another heart container or give you more whip range
[1:20:25] <%athuramn> speed running thought unlocked
[1:20:28] <%DedlokPM> No. Blue means stop. Just remember. Blue Stop Sign.
[1:20:30] <%Nobrev> whip is op
[1:20:32] <%dekkitout> @mcjimbo12 Das gud shit
[1:20:36] <willsin4fun> dot he different color traps actually mean anything or is it just related to the guardians; cause gas man was green & traps were green no?
[1:20:39] <%DedlokPM> ***
[1:20:39] <pixelpaggos> So this game isnt actually multiplayer its just like death phantoms in dark souls?
[1:20:41] <ToneBacas> the money sounds like shotgun shells falling on the floor
[1:20:42] <+blink289> @DedlokPM I heard red haired girls who wear hats are watching it in particular
[1:20:50] <Pookiedaexzile> @QueequegTheater Purple means sneaky
[1:20:58] <LoneFonte> @pixelpaggos yep, all ghost are dead players

[1:27:45] <+mcjimbo12> yeah seriously i know it's because there's time-limited mechanics in the game but really, chests you have to sit at? that's some early 2000s shit
[1:27:52] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> @Pookiedaexzile what like sick backflips or somethin
[1:27:58] <%Nobrev> it's probably a risk/reward thing stand around for more money or move along faster for less money @PatStaresAt

[1:35:31] <%dekkitout> Did you almost do two anchors before touching the ground?
[1:35:37] <Pookiedaexzile> It might be
[1:35:55] <%sandrews> oh like once the temple is done there is a new seed?
[1:35:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> @sandrews It's like a randomizer seed, you get one shot at the seed, and once someone completes it the seed is deleted.
[1:35:59] <willsin4fun> Do the trap colors actually mean anything different? Seems like they're just the same color as the guardian, no?

[1:44:51] <Tracazoid> World would be fucked it it had video game hazards
[1:44:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> No chance, that's what you got
[1:44:57] <%dekkitout> New grown bamboo
[1:44:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt you never seen a misquite tree hav eyou?
[1:44:57] <Tracazoid> if it*
[1:45:01] <Daniel_Is_I> You break it?
[1:45:03] <%za7az> WITH A BIGGER SPIKE
[1:45:04] <%weissguard> I mean, Legos on the carpet are trying to solve that problem.
[1:45:04] <Jaysky> You cannot
[1:45:04] <%Dfreddy8> NO CHANCE
[1:45:04] <+Shockrates20XX> Luckily there aren't a lot of naturally occurring spikes.
[1:45:05] <%BoxNavy> you cant fight one
[1:45:06] <%walternatorz> early man was decimated by spikes until they learned to tame them
[1:45:09] <+Veraverse> Like teeth from animals?
[1:45:10] <%DianaTheAscian> Sir this is a wendys
[1:45:10] <%StaceMcGate> how can you fight stick? if you break it, more sticks
[1:45:12] <%GarbageNirvana> Early humans? Try the Vietnam war
[1:45:13] <+thecosmicfly> Man would be extinct if hedgehogs were 8ft tall
[1:45:14] <+gitgouda> have you tried drowning it?
[1:45:16] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> If you break the spike it merely becomes two smaller spikes
[1:45:16] <%Taisuru> Most spikes were made by man to undo man
[1:45:17] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> You use a spear instead?
[1:45:17] <%MidnightBurst12> predators have spikes in their mouths
[1:45:18] <%mikeriffic> Spikes are the Apex Predator
[1:45:21] <%afronooch> thorns are baby spikes
[1:45:23] <%Monkeyweed21> HUMANS INVENTED SPIKES PAT
[1:45:23] <%dd44dostivei> thoose spike pits in 'nam sounded brutal
[1:45:27] <%bassoontyphoon> With a bigger spike
[1:45:28] <+CherteuseKapibara> lol tell that to the vietnamese
[1:45:28] <Jaysky> @walternatorz Spike on stick is mans best friend
[1:45:29] <stantheman_97> sharp sticks embedded in the ground?
[1:45:29] <%MugenSandan> Pat forests are just giant spike fields and we solved those
[1:45:32] <spike_j_wolfwood> spikes are man's only natural predator.
[1:45:34] <+Buzzkill983> You can't handle my strongest spikes, raider. My strongest spikes will put you in the ground
[1:45:36] <Tracazoid> That and the floor under you opening into a pit suddenly
[1:45:37] <%sandrews> Have you tried reasoning with the spikes?
[1:45:37] <orpleborple> geese have teeth spikes
[1:45:38] <%dekkitout> A rhino's a big moving blade if you think about it
[1:45:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Pointy stick was the first weapon
[1:45:43] <stantheman_97> porcupines?
[1:45:47] <iosephe> it's our natural enemy, like rats and water
[1:45:48] <%StaceMcGate> How can man fight rats? They can swim in water
[1:45:51] <+jennyfurific> poor pat. having all the impossible traps thrown at him
[1:45:53] <Pookiedaexzile> what are spikes but delayed Pointed sticks
[1:45:54] <+yoshkosh20> a spike named dog. coming to movie theaters near you.
[1:45:56] <$Ziegsy> there are razor rocks made by the freezing of water, fields of them. Mankind used to challenge each other to cross them. still do, but not as often. humans are stupid
[1:45:56] <%DianaTheAscian> no
[1:45:58] <Jaysky> @Pookiedaexzile Still one of the best
[1:45:59] <+Veraverse> What if spikes can swim
[1:46:05] <Zourath> Early man became big strong through use of spike, and also fire. Which if you think about it, is just hot spikes.
[1:46:08] <+Punchasaur> It’s why we shoot animals that have spikes on their heads
[1:46:10] <+thecosmicfly> Mans greatest achievements are also it's deadliest enemies. Spikes, fire, tiktok
[1:46:11] <+Maxthetics> "I don't know what weapons World War 3 will be fought with, but World War 4 will be fought with spike traps."
[1:46:13] <+black_pariah> Mankind knew that they cannot change spikes: So, instead of reflecting on themselves, they blamed the pits
[1:46:13] <Jaysky> @Veraverse They cannot just like rats
[1:46:14] <dan_g_v> rare loot
[1:46:15] <%walternatorz> @walternatorz why are so many man's best friends are named spike? curious
[1:46:26] <%Chichen> So, instead of reflecting on themselves, they blamed the spikes.
[1:46:29] <%StaceMcGate> imagine Spikes on Fire who are also tiktok stars
[1:46:36] <%aishman> Hows the game so far Pat?
[1:46:42] <spike_j_wolfwood> can blind people swim?

[1:47:48] <%blutzwavedave> Sponsorship REVOKED
[1:47:51] <%MelBrooksKA> HOW CAN THIS BE!
[1:47:54] <dan_g_v> bad game design
[1:47:54] <%Karglin> Worst Tomb raider NA
[1:47:56] <Lunatyr64> somehow looks less frustrating than spelunky
[1:48:01] <her0_89> The more im seeing of this game the more it looks like Pitfall rogue lite
[1:48:03] <%DianaTheAscian> Pats quoting someone and I wished I knew how

[1:48:14] <%walternatorz> manliest man on twitch
[1:48:14] <%dekkitout> You cant reverse Crazy Talk in your favor sillty
[1:48:25] <dan_g_v> so, the glyphs show you the direction to the exit?

[1:48:52] <%GarbageNirvana> You'll never make it! Never, never make it, ever make it! Don't you know you can't make it!?
[1:48:52] <%za7az> This game looks so stressful to play
[1:48:56] <%StaceMcGate> Pat is imitating the sounds of waves hitting the shore
[1:49:02] <+Maxthetics> Instead of reflecting on himself, Pat blamed the publisher
[1:49:07] <+thecosmicfly> @NateyBeak Omae wa mou shinderu
[1:49:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> @heartlesshealer The fact that its slow and small makes you feel like a real idiot if you actually run into one.
[1:49:11] <%rekinom> Do you need to stand by the chests like that to get everything out of them?
[1:49:12] <Daniel_Is_I> NO CAUTION
[1:49:22] <James_Quivers> I feel like the money in the chests should instantly come to you after hitting them, so as to not disrupt the flow of the gameplay
[1:49:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> This game ABSOLUTELY should have a style meter.
[1:49:46] <+mmack093> Is this like a 3D La Mulana?
[1:49:48] <spike_j_wolfwood> lots of pucker moments.
[1:49:50] <dan_g_v> did we get lost again?
[1:49:50] <%StaceMcGate> This game is scaring Pat more than RE8 ever could
[1:49:54] <Floofiie> @James_Quivers The power of risk/reward when an enemy is chasing you
[1:50:01] <her0_89> every game should have a style meter
[1:50:06] <Wreckinize> how does the movement feel? @PatStaresAt
[1:50:13] <her0_89> what game isnt made better by the addition of a style meter?
[1:50:14] <%WhereIsWill> only pat can do it chat
[1:50:14] <+thecosmicfly> This looks like Indiana Jones and the Mirror's Edge
[1:50:14] <LoneFonte> @CommanderSqueaks an adrenaline meter
[1:50:16] <+Punchasaur> Is this still the temple of saint anger
[1:50:19] <%blutzwavedave> Is this the Simmons catacombs from RE6, Pat?
[1:50:36] <%StaceMcGate> psaCrazyhead
[1:50:41] <dan_g_v> secret upon secret!
[1:50:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat kind new that he could not change trajectory, so instead of reflecting upon himself he blamed the publisher
[1:50:43] <%WhereIsWill> crazy talk requiem

[1:51:52] <TioXyco> eithr that or die trying
[1:51:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Rough and loose
[1:51:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's why he ended up on the Furry Barge
[1:51:54] <he1lhydra> and this is why pat is a potemkin player
[1:51:54] <Laecerelius> Eat all of that shit to gain style
[1:51:55] <%blutzwavedave> But then you get the loose roughness
[1:51:57] <%heartlesshealer> cool stuff like gaping
[1:51:59] <+mmack093> enough about your sex life
[1:52:01] <%Chichen> he cares immensely
[1:52:02] <%dekkitout> There's a joke about needing lube somewhere in there...
[1:52:06] <James_Quivers> After I eat taco bell I experience some rough looseness
[1:52:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> Please do not refer to your love live on stream
[1:52:07] <%cvp5127> watch pat switch games after one victory LUL
[1:52:09] <Pookiedaexzile> He doesn't even care like man
[1:52:13] <dan_g_v> you know, these benches mean that more people hanged around in this place, that means they somehow went through these traps too
[1:52:18] <Wreckinize> if you grapple the ground can you negate fall damage?
