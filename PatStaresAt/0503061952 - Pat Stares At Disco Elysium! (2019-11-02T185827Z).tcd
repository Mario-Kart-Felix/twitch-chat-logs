[0:05:20] <%PROUD2beGINGER> It's too early, let me sleep
[0:05:25] <$GoogleyGareth> This is a great game, but I wonder if it'll be a good streaming game.
[0:05:25] <crazypieman7> although depending on your definition of elysium it could be argued that it's a lot
[0:05:26] <%cvp5127> no

Quick question, I finished the main ARR story and I'm on the way towards HW and there's alot of quests inbetween. Is it ok to just skip the scenes and watch them in the inn room later or just bear with it. i enjoy the story but this is a SLOG.
[0:10:11] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Lookin at skeleton porn as per usual
[0:10:12] <+SamleyTimes> i would recommend not to save-scum too much
[0:10:18] <novusboi> We FF14 and Destiny2 gang now

[0:18:14] <old_dog_god> I have never been less hype for a game than I am for O2
[0:18:18] <%starotter70> @CommanderSqueaks And swirls it around like a straw?
[0:18:18] <reddpop_> was laid off 2 months ago, job hunt sucks

[0:18:31] <%narusao> the sun is for sissies
[0:18:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> there's no oil is Sasquatchewan.

[0:18:37] <+malacante> Cant even turn the sun off to save power smh
[0:18:38] <alrobot2014> the fuck is prairie oil?
[0:18:38] <+jcenderion> @AngriestPat Just condense the prarie dogs
[0:18:40] <therakishsage> @aishman At least some of those games are probably going to be a good time. And probably made my people who are no more happy about the politics of it all than we are. So eh. It is what it is.
[0:18:40] <+SamleyTimes> alberta is the oil
[0:18:43] <%nofestu2> The sun is finite we'll run out of it any day now

[0:18:56] <%ShichiNoBushi> Sunset Sarsaparilla?
[0:19:00] <+SamleyTimes> EASTERNER
[0:19:02] <+Dauntasa> it is foolish to trust the capricious sun for warmth and power, all men should seek to destroy the sun and free ourselves from dependence
[0:19:03] <%Faustgesicht> Sun has a battery life of 8-12 hours. useless
[0:19:06] <segbas2004> "close"
[0:19:16] <%Stratiotai2> lie saskatchewan has more oil than alberta
[0:19:19] <+luketrapwalker> Shaved Head Pat is my favorite Pat
[0:19:21] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Just borrow a cup of oil from your provincial neighbour bro.
[0:19:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> but we don't want to give our oil to the Samsqwanchwanians

[0:19:47] <deviljhojho_> You know, one of the streamers that I watch said that this game ruined outer worlds for him
[0:19:47] <deafmutelaughing> she'd probably enjoy you more if you looked like a skeleton
[0:19:47] <%narusao> protect her smile
[0:19:53] <%BoboDaHobo> hobos are great at sex times
[0:19:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> HOBOCOP WOULD BE DOPE

[0:58:54] <LegendCobra> Pat you should save
[0:58:55] <%realm_forge> Take off your pants to show dominance
[0:58:57] <Funkyfjord> pro tip: do all the drugs
[0:59:04] <%starotter70> Shove cigar in ass
[0:59:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's how Pat flirts with Paige "I want to have fuck with you".
[0:59:05] <Sokumotanaka> SHE THREW NANAKO INTO THE TV!
[0:59:05] <+jcenderion> He needs more electrochemistry
[0:59:09] <Picia000123> Oh yeah, save Pat
[0:59:13] <Retrash> not enough electrochemistry to smoke it
[0:59:14] <$Chatterbox1991> go back for your tie?

[0:59:25] <%Shoosler> lumpytSave lumpytSave lumpytSave lumpytSave
[0:59:27] <+Deadlymuffin5> This game has quicksaves too
[0:59:27] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[0:59:27] <LunarRemix> You should save when you only have 1 health / Morale
[0:59:29] <%GoogleyGareth> Well if you take it again you're dead
[0:59:31] <PirateMike_> Dont worry about that
[0:59:32] <Picia000123> it's fine
[0:59:33] <%honeyman18> Heads up HEAL is stocked automatically on your health, there should be a number there for stocked heals when you get one.
[0:59:34] <%actual_scum> electrochemistry is the only conscience you can trust
[0:59:36] <LodiFrostbeard> you can quicksave btw
[0:59:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> @gracetbm I appreciate the assist
[0:59:43] <Retrash> f5 to quicksave
[0:59:43] <+subdude_> F5 quicksaves btw
[0:59:45] <BunnyEmperor> Pat you are going to die anyway the way you play, so just keep going LUL
[0:59:47] <%GoogleyGareth> SourPls
[0:59:47] <LegendCobra> yeah but if you hit zero on either health or morale you basically die
[0:59:49] <CapCasual> You'll take a lot of damage.
[0:59:50] <ssshhhhhhh> KIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIM

[1:04:05] <jabberwwock> Time progresses in conversation in this game
[1:04:05] <%owldiamond> b u d d y
[1:04:08] <%GoogleyGareth> Oh yeah time keeps moving but it's pretty slow
[1:04:11] <dauver> time moves only in dialogues
[1:04:11] <Funkyfjord> time progression is a key thing in this game, moves forward when you do things
[1:04:14] <%honeyman18> I swear to god my encyclopedia was low and I had no idea where or what anything was.
[1:04:15] <Hellarussian> glass him
[1:04:16] <LegendCobra> yes the arrow of time keeps moving forward
[1:04:16] <%strugglepunk2> only in dialogue
[1:04:24] <stairmaster> time moves when you interact with objects as well. It doesn't actually move forward on its own.
[1:04:29] <moridin6> @honeyman18 lol
[1:04:30] <Personified134> three whole bars
[1:04:33] <%honeyman18> Time stops only for pausing
[1:04:38] <%AncelDeLambert> this is some German school of philosophy, aint it?
[1:04:38] <novusboi> but he’s tending to a bar
[1:04:42] <arkv01> pat just beat his ass and pound his wife
[1:04:48] <$Mopopolis> Hahaha
[1:04:52] <Funkyfjord> there are many schools of philosophy in this game
[1:04:55] <novusboi> idk why but this stream is profoundly relaxing
[1:04:57] <Funkyfjord> everything from marx to incel
[1:04:59] <Jolnir> cmonBruh
[1:05:04] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, but are they all the depressing ones?
[1:05:07] <%GoogleyGareth> yep
[1:05:09] <+KSabot> yeyh
[1:05:09] <moridin6> YES
[1:05:09] <ssshhhhhhh> this is avant guarde eastern european philosophy
[1:05:09] <%owldiamond> yes
[1:05:10] <%JetpackMcQuack> All I learned is that I hate him
[1:05:11] <+SamleyTimes> ye
[1:05:11] <$Mopopolis> Yes
[1:05:11] <@StridentSong> Yup
[1:05:12] <%OdysseyKnight> heal
[1:05:12] <+boriss96> ye
[1:05:12] <novusboi> hell yeah they are brother
[1:05:12] <Owlboy7> why noy
[1:05:13] <semievil77> yes
[1:05:13] <fatalDestiny> Probably
[1:05:13] <%Mr_Pylon> Yes
[1:05:14] <Picia000123> heal
[1:05:14] <stairmaster> yeah
[1:05:14] <CapCasual> Yes
[1:05:15] <Hellarussian> sure
[1:05:15] <@commanderclaw> Yes, you're at 1 hp
[1:05:16] <%Bailey__gaming> this guy sounds like a high discount Alan Rickman impression
[1:05:17] <LegendCobra> use that
[1:05:18] <Funkyfjord> more like cynical versions of all
[1:05:20] <moridin6> hp can affect skill chekcs
[1:05:24] <@SSaryn> You're pretty fragile so yeah keep it at 2 as much as you can
[1:05:24] <@StridentSong> Try to stay away from being at 1HP as much as possible
[1:05:25] <%owldiamond> yeah
[1:05:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> RPJank
[1:05:28] <LegendCobra> yes you don't want to be on 1
[1:05:30] <Retrash> F5 pat
[1:05:31] <+SamleyTimes> theres a quicksave also
[1:05:35] <novusboi> Yes
[1:05:36] <arkv01> take everything
[1:05:38] <arkv01> pay for nothing
[1:05:41] <+Dauntasa> It's useful to know that when your health hits 0 you still have like 5 seconds to use a healing item while the screen fades out
[1:05:41] <stairmaster> Make sure to save before talking to important characters in case you die
[1:05:42] <%Shoosler> lumpytSave lumpytSave lumpytSave lumpytSave
[1:05:47] <Kirlrik> when you're damaged it also reduces certain phys/int skills
[1:05:54] <PirateMike_> @AngriestPat F5 for quicksave
[1:05:55] <+Punchasaur> Just got here, what the heck is this
[1:05:56] <%JetpackMcQuack> i believe in you bubble
[1:06:01] <stairmaster> it's easy to die of shame if you're not careful
[1:06:01] <+thecosmicfly> Miss when this game was called No Truce With The Furies. I loved misreading that title
[1:06:03] <ssshhhhhhh> putting skill points into endurance increases your health level (morale is already pretty high)
[1:06:13] <%GraceTBM> plug it into the lady's chair
[1:06:16] <moridin6> @Punchasaur best rpg ever
[1:06:18] <%Mr_Pylon> Double click to run
[1:06:18] <+SamleyTimes> double click to run as well
[1:06:23] <Funkyfjord> does anyone remember what stats pat chose?
[1:06:24] <stairmaster> Putting skill points into endurance also makes you more facist
[1:06:26] <%honeyman18> GRANDMA!!!
[1:06:35] <novusboi> the wömen
[1:06:36] <stairmaster> your lower intestine will start trying to indoctrinate you
[1:06:39] <LegendCobra> grandma is so sweet

[1:09:23] <stairmaster> it's cool because failing skill checks doesn't just deprive you of content but give you other stuff like failing that previous check gives you the worst fake name ever

[1:13:59] <+VashyronM> @commanderclaw Haha, cool. The being "dumb" thing also seems like just a put off that I think keeps most people from being all muscle.

[1:14:12] <LegendCobra> THATS RACIST
[1:14:13] <stairmaster> @GarbageNirvana yes. The devs are from estonia so the whole living in the wreckage of history theme pervades this.
[1:14:14] <SparkAfterDark> Did pat take the Race Card perk?
[1:14:14] <deafmutelaughing> that is what containers do

[1:15:04] <%ShineTheDiamond> So is this game a horror murder mystery?
[1:15:21] <stairmaster> this game is a magical realist noire that's pretty funny but also very melancholic.
[1:15:21] <mield916> I love how the epic game store constantly shifts between not working and working poorly.
[1:15:26] <konarius> it is Disco drug mystery

[1:19:02] <LegendCobra> failing checks just make your game different
[1:19:04] <%honeyman18> Just roll with the punches
[1:19:04] <stairmaster> this game is about how we're all total idiot manchildren in the year 2019 and everything is crumbling around us

[1:35:33] <stairmaster> Do a full lp and shit talk outer worlds the whole time.
[1:35:35] <zamzoph> And Pat'll have to read EVERYTHING aloud for the stream LUL
[1:35:35] <%rarvikar> Everybody go and buy it to support the devs, they're fantastic guys
[1:35:35] <absolute_cagemony> That's not a game that's just a tower made of bongs.
[1:35:36] <%ClericOfSparda> "Real video game"
[1:35:37] <arkv01> SHENMUE 3 ISNT A REAL GAME HUH

[1:35:46] <%Dr_Mooose> ye

[1:35:47] <%mh9s> FUCK THA POLICE
[1:35:50] <Soulglove> current climate
[1:35:50] <korean_random> honestly it looks much more interesting than Outer Worlds
[1:35:51] <%crazy_laughter> Good thing you're HOBOCOP!
[1:35:52] <Owlboy7> this is way better than outer worlds to be honest
[1:35:53] <%FalseEyeD> What does Current Climate mean?
[1:35:55] <star_feline> Going straight to the underground

[1:36:09] <%GraceTBM> that accent is cute
[1:36:12] <Dio_TR> Pat's never playing this game again, shame, at least will have this stream LUL
[1:36:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> indivisible is a real game, but I'm in the Pat camp in that it's not for me.
[1:36:16] <yeetdabsenpai69> DAMM YOU PAT YOU COWARD
[1:36:16] <%LodiFrostbeard> @Owlboy7 the dialogue really puts tow to shame
[1:36:16] <konarius> outer worlds is a cringefest
[1:36:18] <%rarvikar> the writing in this game makes Outer Worlds look like piss
[1:36:18] <Picia000123> Too many games to play climate
[1:36:19] <Croetec> walking simulator is more interesting Kappa
[1:36:21] <%strugglepunk2> I'd rather see this than DS tbh
[1:36:23] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Joke's on you! Hobocop doesn't have a home."
[1:36:24] <+VashyronM> Death Stranding isn't a game
[1:36:26] <arkv01> looks like these pigs are getting dinner tonight
[1:36:26] <+KSabot> Death Stranding streams can't wait
[1:36:26] <star_feline> POINT

[1:36:37] <smegma_sorcerer> PixelBob
[1:36:37] <%GraceTBM> Can't wait to see Pat hike across a whole continent in DS
[1:36:41] <jhoroz> lol death stranding is a literal 50 hour walking simulator
[1:36:44] <ssshhhhhhh> up north is the backyard of the hostel-cafe, that's where the corpse was supposed to be
[1:36:50] <stairmaster> narttor voice: she knows who the pigs are
[1:36:57] <Hoot_Patoots> fuck da popo
[1:37:01] <deafmutelaughing> 1312
[1:37:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> @lodifrostbeard but it's a completely different kind of game so that's not a really fair comparison.
[1:37:12] <ssshhhhhhh> we are looking for hobocop
[1:37:13] <Dio_TR> "Death Stranding is not fun but it's a necessary game" so it's garbage then LUL

[2:00:58] <stairmaster> you play the role of the saddest cop there has ever been
[2:01:01] <GreatestGuess> Is this game just dialogue?
[2:01:03] <PirateMike_> @PlainSimpleTailor you should
[2:01:06] <ssshhhhhhh> the saddest song!
[2:01:10] <%LodiFrostbeard> i would often go there

[2:01:23] <Kevendithas> @PlainSimpleTailor he's not going to play anymore on stream after this he said
[2:01:24] <moridin6> TOOLBOX

[2:01:31] <Dio_TR> yes I'm glad you aren't playing it @plainsimpletailor you are too fucking dumb to play it anyways Kappa LUL
[2:01:34] <Funkyfjord> this game is dialogue and characters, scenery, story, and events
[2:01:34] <stairmaster> currently pat's going for hobocop but he might multiclass into communist hobocop too

[2:02:00] <stairmaster> Disco Elysium is basically alpha protocol without the mediocre gameplay
[2:02:03] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @Dio_TR I jumped in halfway to be fair. No need to be hostile.
[2:02:07] <PkSilent01> I thought this game was about Disco

[2:02:50] <ssshhhhhhh> up to the north is the backyard twhere the corpse was supposed to be
[2:03:02] <stairmaster> yeah basically the devs noticed how modern table top rpgs started to move away from being focused primarily on combat... two decades ago and decided that might be a good idea for their video game rpg
[2:03:06] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I've never seen a game with so much real-time introspection
[2:03:07] <Sapphire_Breeze> dual wield
[2:03:15] <GuelermeDias> that's how the hobo cop rolls
[2:03:18] <%Dr_Mooose> you look like a psycho

[2:36:52] <Funkyfjord> other characters can have different reactions to the same dialogue options based on previous events
[2:36:52] <%GraceTBM> there's fuckin tons
[2:36:54] <MahoganyWoods> Ive heard two discussions of this game and both of them were different recounts from each other and from your game today.
[2:36:54] <ssshhhhhhh> this is literature
[2:36:54] <Owlboy7> @AngriestPat skills are basically your companions in this game
