[0:06:02] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt Could be worse pat I did all of that AND did NG+ and I probabl;y won't play the game again for a year now

[0:06:32] <tuesti> dog
[0:06:36] <%jackythefrost> Its fish
[0:06:36] <+Candledark> Is that a banana in Pat's pocket, or is he just happy to see his dog.
[0:06:37] <ergulor> just change his name to banana easy
[0:06:39] <Ner234> "Where banana?'
[0:06:39] <rosabellamelantha> speaking of the final boss in NG+ is actually easier
[0:06:43] <VaguelyHeroic> So handsome now. What a change.
[0:06:52] <Born_2_Late> mmm deliciously caught up on this mammoth playthrough
[0:06:53] <rosabellamelantha> what a good boy
[0:06:56] <%notsoy> dog good and cute
[0:06:56] <MaritimeSpanker> Boy, I don't know if it's because of the flue and fever, but he's looking cuter than usual
[0:07:08] <+BootyFriend> Rejuvinating jowls
[0:07:09] <Shockmaster182> Does it feel weird being so close to the end?
[0:07:11] <%AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> He’s such a good cuddly boi
[0:07:11] <+Rofiarf> i like Zangief's colour scheme
[0:07:43] <zenith0111> Oooooh
[0:08:03] <+tar2ffe> At Int 24 you can go full Vergil.
[0:08:07] <MaritimeSpanker> oh he tired
[0:08:15] <%BinaryFireball> oh wow, I guess that makes sense??
[0:08:18] <rosabellamelantha> yep she's unchanged
[0:08:40] <lyzejag> Oh really ?? That's.. interesting
[0:08:43] <%thepaintedring> what do you imagine the dlc difficulty scale will be?
[0:08:58] <+Aokaay> god I love that dog
[0:08:59] <Born_2_Late> look at that final atomic bussy
[0:09:02] <%BinaryFireball> I mean weapon arts only scale with the weapon itself really and not your skills (noticeably)
[0:09:08] <MaritimeSpanker> How many dragons have you killed, pat?
[0:09:15] <%jackythefrost> Bleed on NG+ FUCKS
[0:09:16] <Omenaire_> \[T]/
[0:09:17] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt I tried NG++ for a meme and noble scion killed me instantly
[0:09:23] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt by the way, you have about 6 major bosses left and how ever much clean up you want to do to finish
[0:09:24] <rosabellamelantha> grafted scion*
[0:09:25] <MaritimeSpanker> worth it though I bet
[0:09:25] <+Mrbaconator> bleed is nuts
[0:09:26] <%cade_calrayn> gief looks tired
[0:09:28] <Ner234> SLime
[0:09:30] <MavMedic81> Hello Gamer
[0:09:32] <LMTTN> How many times have you respecced?
[0:09:46] <%cade_calrayn> is Gief falling asleep?
[0:09:57] <jacksawjack> Beef Bork!
[0:10:01] <%LetsBeBadAtVideoGames> LetsBeBadAtVideoGames subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Hey! Just got to lvl 107 and I’m Malenia is kicking my fuckin ass. I love this game so much
[0:10:06] <MaritimeSpanker> he's such a comfortable boy
[0:10:09] <Born_2_Late> are ya winning dad?
[0:10:09] <MaritimeSpanker> he looks so very huggable
[0:10:24] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Bubble Gief can't quick back the waking hours
[0:10:57] <+Rofiarf> yes
[0:10:57] <%jackythefrost> YES
[0:11:00] <%JoshManVGH> Yes
[0:11:03] <+Rofiarf> its entirely voiced
[0:11:05] <%JoshManVGH> A lot of voice acting
[0:11:07] <%notsoy> eyyy
[0:11:07] <zenith0111> Im 100% IN
[0:11:10] <MaritimeSpanker> Man, I wish the Shadowrun games got voiceacting
[0:11:12] <%JoshManVGH> Like all of it, its ok
[0:11:13] <%jackythefrost> ALMOST 90% OF THE GAME IS VA'D
[0:11:16] <Evilpuppys> haha
[0:11:17] <BigFingerRo> well then!
[0:11:19] <%MrMegaJackpots> almost fully
[0:11:21] <AllenDeadman> yes
[0:11:23] <MaritimeSpanker> Dragonfall is so fucking good
[0:11:24] <%notsoy> this reminds me i still haven't gotten to the 2nd half of 3H and i don't think i'll ever drum up the interest
[0:11:24] <Ghufufin> the quality is of the VO is pretty varied but it exists
[0:11:25] <%JonathLP> Main characters are voice acted, minor NPCs aren't I believe
[0:11:30] <%solracc25> yes
[0:11:31] <%AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> The face of intrigue lmao
[0:11:37] <lyzejag> Bruh
[0:11:37] <%solracc25> plenty of VA
[0:11:38] <%JonathLP> so like Jonas, the Savior is voiced, but like Mike the Beggar isn't
[0:11:40] <+Mrbaconator> millenial is tough
[0:11:43] <zenith0111> Only 107? Oof
[0:11:47] <jacksawjack> My nurse says Gief is adorable
[0:11:55] <+vivivielle> I was like 120 when I was beating Melania and she was still kicking my ass lol
[0:11:57] <%king_wragles> Quick, someone give Pat money to delay the game
[0:12:01] <Rangriz> I'm like 130 and she's still kicking my ass
[0:12:04] <%Pyon84> Lirik has been on Malenia for the last 4 hours I think.
[0:12:04] <%GustauveVIII> it looks like one of the best game ever but has one of the worst names ever, unless triangle strategy is actually being referenced in some part of the game
[0:12:07] <zenith0111> Her zone is technically a "secret zone" so lvl 100 is like really low there
[0:12:11] <+Shishi1205> I did the 6? endings yesterday via save scumming
[0:12:13] <BigFingerRo> WHAAA ONLY 10 MINS OF THANKA DA PEEPO? this isn't GregLooksAt content!
[0:12:13] <MaritimeSpanker> geeez, how much of the map is left? christ
[0:12:16] <+Shishi1205> Rad endings
[0:12:20] <MaritimeSpanker> whoah
[0:12:23] <+Shishi1205> (some of them)
[0:12:27] <+Rofiarf> what it do?
[0:12:27] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt I beat melania but only because I summoned another player and they did some kind of trickery to one-shot her THROUGH THE BOSS DOOR with sorcery
[0:12:28] <%LetsBeBadAtVideoGames> Moonlight greatsword int/dex build and I’ve gotten her down to 20%
[0:12:32] <$EsotericOdyssey> straight into phase 2
[0:12:33] <zenith0111> The sleepy torch!!
[0:12:34] <%Dakuu75> why is the tourch overpowered?
[0:12:34] <Omenaire_> is it that powerful?
[0:12:38] <$EsotericOdyssey> then they one-shot her a second time
[0:12:38] <DracaenaLeaf> meep
[0:12:39] <+Shishi1205> that torch sleeps
[0:12:43] <%AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> How torch work?

[0:13:37] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt have you seen anyone one-shot bosses through the boss door? someone I summoned for Melania did that
[0:13:54] <$EsotericOdyssey> Malenia

[0:14:01] <$EsotericOdyssey> however it's spelled
[0:14:02] <+Mrbaconator> this is THE BEST bleed skill
[0:14:05] <+Aokaay> bet the sword art would get it

[0:15:42] <+Shishi1205> This is still a souls game, dragons are weaker on the head
[0:15:44] <Shockmaster182> Dragon? More like big stinky loser

[0:16:26] <theghosttcatt> BIG BLEED
[0:16:36] <TrollKing96> Is Malenia's sword categorized as a curved sword or a katana?
[0:16:46] <theghosttcatt> katana
[0:16:47] <+Shishi1205> the bubble?
[0:16:48] <+tar2ffe> Did Pat beat the big white dragon/wyrm at the Royal Capital?
[0:16:51] <+Rofiarf> Malenia's sword?
[0:16:53] <+vivivielle> katana
[0:17:02] <zenith0111> Her own sword? LUL
[0:17:05] <BigFingerRo> Pat are you saying Malenia's name as Melania or is that just me?
[0:17:06] <ape_hawk> who's malenia? some kind of blade of miquella?
[0:17:09] <+Shishi1205> lightning dragon?
[0:17:12] <tuesti> LUL
[0:17:12] <+Mrbaconator> Yes
[0:17:15] <MaritimeSpanker> isn't that dragon just a set piece?
[0:17:17] <+Shishi1205> Yeah outside
[0:17:18] <%Valdorick> You did. You got the Glaive
[0:17:18] <Sunstalker> Damn 15 minutes in and fighting a dragon

[0:17:22] <oda_flobunaga> yes you did
[0:17:27] <Sunstalker> No the one you beat already, thje red lightning one.
[0:17:28] <$EsotericOdyssey> there's a drragon outside the capital
[0:17:29] <+tar2ffe> is it lightning?
[0:17:30] <NewWillinium> There's a dragon at the Capital that isn't the dead one you climb?
[0:17:32] <ergulor> the female one?
[0:17:32] <$EsotericOdyssey> Lanisseax or w/;e
[0:17:32] <AllenDeadman> there sure is
[0:17:33] <+tar2ffe> or light?
[0:17:42] <+Shishi1205> sheesh
[0:17:43] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt he's just before the capital in Atlus with a better version of the red lightning spell
[0:17:46] <+tar2ffe> It spawns from the sky
[0:17:49] <$EsotericOdyssey> the dragon that drops the red lightning glaive spell
[0:17:49] <AllenDeadman> the lightning one I think
[0:17:50] <+Candledark> Remember kids, always stab a dragon in the butt. It works best.
[0:17:56] <+tar2ffe> in a weird void above a camp
[0:17:59] <%NBUsagi> Pat is drunk on the power of dragons
[0:18:10] <NewWillinium> So Pat, enjoying your new Dex Build?
[0:18:15] <+tar2ffe> Thing was f**cked
[0:18:19] <+Shishi1205> there's like 9 dragons in this game
[0:18:31] <BigFingerRo> Gief looks so downtrodden today
[0:18:32] <%luftraumm1> so yu're pushing through to the end today eh? @PatStaresAt
[0:18:33] <xxHungryxx> Zangief is a Dragon dog
[0:18:38] <%MartinOfLoxley> honestly I like the fact that you can actually fight dragons now
[0:18:39] <MaritimeSpanker> I wonder if it's happened now
[0:18:40] <Mitchellsocks> That Death Bird is a SHIT
[0:18:40] <theghosttcatt> birdmans pek is op
[0:18:41] <%cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @patstaresat Whats the best-looking armour set in the entire game in your opinion?

[0:18:44] <$HyperionXV> Hello folks. raysH
[0:18:45] <bassoontyphoon> Unpopular Opinion: Dragons are fucking lame

[0:18:47] <Mountaindrewdle> eat the dragon heart
[0:18:48] <NewWillinium> So how does the Dragon Eye thing work? Is it just buying all of the Dragon Spells?
[0:18:48] <pi_in_the_sci> what did it give you?
[0:18:50] <zenith0111> "Daddys talking to the Ghosts again and it confuses me"
[0:19:01] <+tar2ffe> Enochian Blade with Godefrey talisman is fun

[0:20:00] <MaritimeSpanker> pat the dragon padlalin
[0:20:04] <Mitchellsocks> Game has a few too many Asylum Demons and Tree Spirits, but the dragons are ok if a tad repetive cause their theme slaps

[0:20:18] <%codedoomboy> No flame give me strength?
[0:20:18] <televisedrevolting> Did Pat beat what's her name?
[0:20:18] <+vivivielle> @Jaxnos yeah some mausoleums for me are also bugged, sucks
[0:20:20] <%bundle_of_herbs> is there anything special for getting all the dragon spells?
[0:20:22] <zenith0111> @jaxnos Gotta quit and reload to make them work its a dumb bug

[0:21:05] <NewWillinium> So yeah you don't have a lot of the game left. I can easily see you finishing it off by the end of the night
[0:21:05] <BigFingerRo> I'm liking the theme of rotting and body parts getting conjoined all over the place
[0:21:07] <$Jaxnos> @zenith0111 while in them? because i've done the quit and reload outside the castle sol one
[0:21:08] <%Aeoneth> You mean Malenia, Blade of Miquella

[0:23:32] <%JonathLP> Look at statue
[0:23:32] <+Shishi1205> +12 is the max
[0:23:34] <Zourath> Fire hot
[0:23:37] <+wizard_of_diamonds> What did he get? I missed it
[0:23:40] <xxHungryxx> First church of Murica
[0:23:43] <NewWillinium> I think I got invaded here. Don't remember by whom though
[0:23:45] <%JonathLP> Look at the statue
[0:23:47] <+Shishi1205> I mean that you can reach
[0:23:47] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt talk to Melina here
[0:23:57] <%CoffeeKaiju> Hello Pat and Chat!
[0:23:58] <theghosttcatt> can talk to the maiden here
[0:23:58] <oda_flobunaga> @Sunstalker its northeast of Selia.  You have to do it for Sellen's quest
[0:23:58] <%Cozy90> hi everyone!
[0:24:00] <%JonathLP> remember for later
[0:24:04] <$EsotericOdyssey> it goes up to 14 iirc
[0:24:05] <%CoffeeKaiju> woah cool sword
[0:24:05] <%BinaryFireball> is it though?
[0:24:06] <$SGrim> with arms
[0:24:07] <U_l_f_b_e_r_h_t> MELINA!
[0:24:08] <$EsotericOdyssey> not 12
[0:24:20] <+tar2ffe> Pat, are you rocking a Brass Shield or just look similar?
[0:24:29] <NewWillinium> I ended up with 14 potions and 4 Golden Seeds. I was missing one to make 15
[0:24:32] <doster504> you can have 14 flasks but you upgrade them 12 times fellers
[0:24:34] <oda_flobunaga> @Sunstalker its north of the Church of Gripes
[0:24:37] <megaman_sentinel> I'm starting not to trust her
[0:24:39] <Parapattern> Better take a sippy quickly
[0:24:40] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt Did you continue the Golden mask quest?
[0:24:44] <+ipaintwithcolor> @NewWillinium hard capped at 14
[0:24:47] <zenith0111> @newwillinium 14 is the max
[0:24:47] <+Shishi1205> Or at what point are you
[0:24:51] <$Jaxnos> based on how it dumps me out, i'm guessing the game has the mausoleum in some weird half-state where it can't pinpoint that it exists in sitting mode. welp, hope they fix that one day.
[0:24:57] <+tar2ffe> Well OK, was thinking whether it was worth upgrading. Using the Carian Knight myself
[0:25:03] <sendart> The tree really doesn't like fire
[0:25:13] <Sunstalker> @oda_flobunaga Oh that one, got confused when yiou said cliff. I think of it as a rockwall, cliffs beiing the edges of the map instead
[0:25:13] <%X2Eliah> So uh, where can one farm for Smithing Stones [3]? I've cleaned out and picked up all the in-wolrd  ones in mines etc, so now I gotta find what enemies drop them...
[0:25:15] <Omenaire_> good ol gold mask
[0:25:21] <+Shishi1205> Did you find corhyn?
[0:25:31] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you got to the proper goldmask point but you did mess up the brother's quest a bit
[0:25:31] <senfood> Melina...hate to break it to you, cutie, but the Erdtree kinda fucking sucks.
[0:25:32] <NewWillinium> I *think* that's it until you light the Kiln for Gold Mask
[0:25:34] <zenith0111> Hes at the bridge last time yeah?
[0:25:34] <depressioncherrie> pretty sure this is it for gold mask until the erdtree burns, no?
[0:25:35] <MaritimeSpanker> How does patron look sans helmet?
[0:25:36] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt as long as you returned to him and told him the riddle answer, you're good. You'll see him after you finish up the giant stuff
[0:25:36] <sirrice77> Did you meet goldmask by the captial? if not you need to do that before completing this area
[0:25:40] <%BinaryFireball> the calculus of his t-pose
[0:25:41] <+Shishi1205> Ok, did you reveal the secret to him?
[0:25:41] <Born_2_Late> i was telling someone how i still dont know what the elden ring even is. and they asked me "whats a dark soul?" and i was like uuuuuh....
[0:25:43] <+wizard_of_diamonds> What's with all the ghost trees
[0:25:44] <%kknutson4> Did you kill that boss in the hellscape?
[0:25:48] <cavefishes> I wanna say the gold mask quest can break if you go to the kiln
[0:25:50] <Mitchellsocks> Goldmask is a Sigma Male
[0:26:02] <+Shishi1205> Then you can meet them in a bridge in this region
[0:26:05] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt did you get the Rune of Absolute Order form Goldmask?
[0:26:15] <rosabellamelantha> Vyke's evergoal is hilarious
[0:26:16] <yyyyfdugyu> did you kill scrimblo god of the grumblus
[0:26:16] <+tar2ffe> Carian Knight shield with Magic Shield sorcery is very nice
[0:26:18] <NewWillinium> Gwyn just wanted to fill the Dark Souls of Humanity with Light
[0:26:19] <+Shishi1205> @oda_flobunaga thats for later

[0:28:31] <MaritimeSpanker> looks like it
[0:28:32] <rosabellamelantha> @sirrice77 You can see the burn marks on his armour in the same spots you get burned
[0:28:33] <+Shishi1205> probably one of the easiest ones
[0:28:33] <%ashenfrenzy> jeeeesus what is that
[0:28:37] <CptHarlok> Weeb weapon, doesn't count /s

[0:28:51] <%delilah4you> Oh jeez you swapped to Dex instead of Str? Goddamn
[0:28:54] <oda_flobunaga> @Shishi1205 he's literally got it equipped right now
[0:28:57] <xxHungryxx> his spear is also good for pvp because it gives frenzy to ppl you hit
[0:29:03] <%robotoken> @Pat what sword are you using?
[0:29:05] <Omenaire_> \[T]/
[0:29:08] <%dmbender> the fingies burned him
[0:29:10] <%dmbender> you hate to see it
[0:29:14] <+5Two> Grape Skeleton
[0:29:21] <Wakerz140> The helmet is super extra scuffed
[0:29:22] <MaritimeSpanker> you got his miracle though
[0:29:27] <%X2Eliah> its a good faith spear
[0:29:28] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt if you go frenzied flame you get scorched in the same spots on your skin but don't die because you took said armour off
[0:29:29] <zenith0111> His lightning buff is dank it also lowers equipment weight
[0:29:29] <%BinaryFireball> I let a dude who told me how to get 2 spears.... I wanna cry
[0:29:30] <%X2Eliah> really good
[0:29:30] <%luftraumm1> try it now?
[0:29:30] <sirrice77> @sirrice77 yes, so im not sure what difference him wearing armor or not would've made. His mistake wasn't wearing armor, it was that he went up against the 3 fingers without being able to actually do anything to them and they grabbed him
[0:29:32] <%BinaryFireball> met
[0:29:34] <+wizard_of_diamonds> He didn't invade for me, either
[0:29:36] <+Shishi1205> @oda_flobunaga Yeah I realised after writing in chat, Its bc I did mine at a weird timing
[0:29:39] <Mitchellsocks> Did he do the bloodypalace?

[0:34:48] <spookykrow> thats a helmet?
[0:34:51] <MaritimeSpanker> good catch with the side path there
[0:34:57] <spookykrow> I thought it was just the face
[0:35:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> NotLikeThis
[0:35:04] <MaritimeSpanker> @sleepy_pink yers
[0:35:06] <+tar2ffe> Pats no IG model. He no do shit for camera.
[0:35:08] <%Kevlar_Caviar> JESUS
[0:35:08] <%Ixiah> JESUS
[0:35:09] <+Shishi1205> damn they almost bodied
[0:35:15] <+Jozpiu> jesus
[0:35:17] <Pudgy_Pidgey> PANIC
[0:35:22] <NewWillinium> Do these Mariennetes have lore? I know that you can get their heads as hats.
[0:35:23] <MaritimeSpanker> man these dudes flail around like crazy
[0:35:29] <sleepy_pink> @MaritimeSpanker whatever it is, it's proably true. there's multiple things that affect eye color
[0:35:32] <%fat_burtreynolds> Goddamn turtles in a half shell
[0:35:39] <zanzibarian_hamster> greasy
[0:35:41] <MaritimeSpanker> oh cool, thank you
[0:35:46] <theghosttcatt> turtle shield aint far behind
[0:35:48] <+wizard_of_diamonds> How about Turtle Shield?
[0:35:50] <+Cuon_Alpinus> turtleshell shield p good too
[0:35:51] <MaritimeSpanker> @sleepy_pink meant to reply, but thank you
[0:35:53] <+Shishi1205> at the first soldiers drop it too
[0:35:55] <+tar2ffe> Carian Knight got good magic/physical
[0:35:57] <Sunstalker> Banished Knight shield
[0:36:02] <lyzejag> I've used it for 95% of this game
[0:36:03] <oda_flobunaga> The Turtleshell's got Increased stamina regen though
[0:36:05] <+Shishi1205> yeah jellyfish shield rocks
[0:36:06] <Blank9> it's insane it has 56 guard boost at the start and that's higher than a lot of great shields
[0:36:09] <DigiDom> Has Pat been to the Haligtree yet?
[0:36:12] <+tar2ffe> Jellyfish Shield also
[0:36:12] <tanarath> where do you get the brass shield?
[0:36:15] <%Ixiah> why, 100% is the same on all shields ?
[0:36:15] <CptHarlok> Banished Knight shield is ever so slightly worse, but damn does it look a whole lot better.
[0:36:15] <%X2Eliah> banished knight shield has noticably less guard
[0:36:18] <Murphio_GS> Mage towers always have elevators
[0:36:18] <MaritimeSpanker> a good, strong shieldfu
[0:36:20] <$Solid_Stro> sabert14Box
[0:36:22] <theghosttcatt> yes pat been to hailgtree
[0:36:24] <cavefishes> The inverted crest heater / beast crest heater shield only require 10 strength
[0:36:31] <+tar2ffe> I prefer a no skill shield though
[0:36:33] <Blank9> it's so light compared to great shields too
[0:36:46] <%sniffy77> thats the arrow rain spell its great
[0:36:47] <+Shishi1205> boss magic
[0:36:49] <atlasdotwav> spell is good area denial
[0:36:50] <%Nobrev> this spell is cool but I can't use it very effectively
[0:37:09] <cavefishes> This counts for the legendary sorcery / incantation achievement
[0:37:11] <%fat_burtreynolds> Artemis Gunslinger 3
[0:37:13] <+FroggoPrince> Ah, yes, FFXIV Megaflare
[0:37:14] <NewWillinium> Huh. I never found that spell. I wonder if it would have helped in my fights
[0:37:15] <+Shishi1205> this spell is to bait melee invaders
[0:37:28] <%dekkitout> What sort of elevator isnt honse compliant?
[0:37:30] <%TheAdMerlin> Horsey is spectral, so they dont' have weight
[0:37:41] <Ner234> Horses HATE elevators
[0:37:45] <+tar2ffe> Anyone hit a Player with the lifesteal arm?
[0:37:47] <+Shishi1205> Oh cool fort incoming
[0:37:54] <%fat_burtreynolds> Mind Horse csbeastRichard
[0:37:59] <MaritimeSpanker> man I love snowy areas
[0:38:01] <Blank9> fort, night

[0:38:05] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt pat did you find Iron Fist alexander in mt gelmir yet?
[0:38:07] <Finchit> wow thats a deep cut
[0:38:08] <%X2Eliah> did we find out who is making all those marionettes?
[0:38:10] <%Dakuu75> lol
[0:38:15] <Finchit> feeling good about feeling good
[0:38:20] <+Shishi1205> @rosabellamelantha no
[0:38:21] <%TheAdMerlin> I just realized pat can use the BIG divine spear now since he's so stacked into Dex
[0:38:21] <%dekkitout> But did you beat Elden Ring with DK bongo drums with both arms broken
[0:38:21] <%X2Eliah> Liurnia, lol, nop, Woolie had to back down from Stormveil
[0:38:21] <%NBUsagi> lol Pat you shit
[0:38:26] <+Shishi1205> he obviously isnt there yet
[0:38:34] <Blank9> you can find out the marionette thing as early as liurnia
[0:38:34] <cavefishes> 4 hours of smug Elden ring bragging
[0:38:39] <rosabellamelantha> @Shishi1205 this is beyond gelmir
[0:38:41] <%fat_burtreynolds> I’m just resting my eyelids
[0:38:42] <%SaiyanShoto> To be fair I saw someone beat the game in like 4 streams LUL
[0:38:43] <%Deadpal> LOL
[0:38:45] <+Shishi1205> fuck I keep forgetting gelmir is near volcano
[0:38:47] <+pugszerosugar> Spite Pat is Best Pat
[0:38:49] <Finchit> did woolie beat stormveil yet?
[0:38:50] <Omega_acceptile> Elden Ring is really fun, I love hitting enemies really hard for fun LUL
[0:38:52] <%Dakuu75> cocky
[0:38:53] <Sunstalker> The Fire Nation PogChamp
[0:38:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> Woolie just started heading towards the Weeping Peninsula right?
[0:38:55] <V0LK__> "this fight is pointless" Kappa
[0:38:55] <%Pookiedaexzile> STOPPED
[0:38:56] <doster504> empty castle is ok
[0:38:59] <tanarath> F
[0:38:59] <%gitgouda> never forget...fromsoftware game.
[0:39:01] <+Shishi1205> I have brain rot
[0:39:02] <NewWillinium> So what kind of threat could they give us in a DLC?
[0:39:02] <Ner234> STOPPED
[0:39:05] <theghosttcatt> big fire stick go bonk
[0:39:05] <@Spydurman> they're for real
[0:39:08] <%Ixiah> does elden ring have level scaling ?
[0:39:12] <+5Two> Ooh! This place!
[0:39:13] <%fat_burtreynolds> Too Spicy
[0:39:17] <NewWillinium> The Fire Monks are what inspired me to make my Faith build initially.
[0:39:20] <MaritimeSpanker> you ahve one of their chest peices from earlier, iirc
[0:39:22] <Trace_Bovier> has pat stopped caring about scraping?
[0:39:23] <+5Two> I love this boss.
[0:39:24] <%X2Eliah> @Ixiah doesnt seem so
[0:39:24] <+Shishi1205> @Ixiah no
[0:39:24] <Kinteka> There's an incantation book in that fort
[0:39:25] <MaritimeSpanker> though it was heavy
[0:39:26] <doster504> he did it
[0:39:30] <+Shishi1205> only ng+ scaling
[0:39:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> So why are all the trolls Gutless again
[0:39:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> large chain
[0:39:45] <%nanaki_ff14> nanaki_ff14 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Fuck this zone's legacy dungeon so much I love this game fuck this game! 114Hrs in and I can't stop playing!
[0:39:47] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt the fort has a cool shield
[0:39:50] <%Nobrev> looh at that darksouls 2
[0:39:52] <Finchit> same exact model just upscaled
[0:39:54] <%fat_burtreynolds> What blade is pat rocking now?
[0:39:56] <MaritimeSpanker> no invader on the chain this time
[0:39:56] <%Dakuu75> Giants ALWAYS get it bad, in these games
[0:39:57] <fishmonger555> What sword is that?
[0:39:58] <+BootyFriend> Sonic CD opening
[0:40:03] <%Cigwynn> wth, how did all these people die???
[0:40:03] <%Nobrev> MAP COMPLETE
[0:40:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> monkaS why so much blood
[0:40:07] <NewWillinium> @Pookiedaexzile I think we never quite find out, but considering the next boss I have a prpesumption
[0:40:08] <%JoshManVGH> Love a good impractical chain bridge
[0:40:09] <%X2Eliah> all those blood spots right around the campfire is scary
[0:40:09] <%Cigwynn> It's a Grace
[0:40:16] <LMTTN> Have you revealed the whole map now?
[0:40:29] <rosabellamelantha> I like DS2 a lot but it has issues
[0:40:32] <theghosttcatt> he has
[0:40:35] <%dekkitout> But Pat, Dark Souls 2 is genius and here's why...
[0:40:37] <%Cigwynn> DS2 is the best DS game because Power Stancing
[0:40:37] <zanzibarian_hamster> good job pat
[0:40:42] <%fat_burtreynolds> I feel some god of war 2 right here
[0:40:42] <+Shishi1205> elden ring has some ds2 ass moments and they can megasuck
[0:40:44] <MaritimeSpanker> oh, it's the worst one, but I enjoy it still
[0:40:45] <LMTTN> DS2 would be fine without ADP and tracking
[0:40:45] <%X2Eliah> Dark Souls 2 is the best dark souls because it still has the original PS2 graphics
[0:40:49] <$Solid_Stro> Exactly sabert14Smug
[0:40:51] <%Dakuu75> ...
[0:40:52] <stormhawk9891> ???????
[0:40:52] <DracaenaLeaf> ????
[0:40:54] <+Mrbaconator> that's CRAZY
[0:40:54] <Shockmaster182> No no, Harris told me it was good
[0:40:56] <zenith0111> LUL
[0:40:57] <%fat_burtreynolds> Soul Gumbo
[0:40:57] <%mythcreant> h
[0:40:58] <%Nobrev> I enjoyed DS2 until scholar ruined it
[0:40:58] <GrenYena> Literally what?
[0:40:58] <%Deadpal> Why dark souls 2 though
[0:40:59] <tanarath> creepy49Porpkek
[0:40:59] <%mythcreant> wha
[0:40:59] <NewWillinium> And they were RIGHT.
[0:41:00] <valstriam> ...
[0:41:00] <sleepy_pink> I like ds2 but that's just silly
[0:41:01] <zenith0111> WHO EVEN SAYS THAT
[0:41:01] <%BinaryFireball> omg I saw that shit
[0:41:02] <KatabolicRage> ???
[0:41:02] <%Deadpal> I don't get hat
[0:41:04] <+5Two> Contratians
[0:41:04] <Ner234> ??? I'm sorry what
[0:41:04] <Finchit> ngl true
[0:41:05] <jacksawjack> dudes in armor
[0:41:05] <%Rbeatononefour> just wow
[0:41:07] <%MelancholicMasochist> It’s not bad it’s just not as good as the rest
[0:41:07] <zenith0111> WHERE DID THAT COME FROM
[0:41:08] <Blank9> dark souls 2 has the best fist moveset (caestus power stance + bone fist), that's a strong metric
[0:41:08] <NewWillinium> Scholar is so good
[0:41:08] <%mythcreant> lost in the sauce
[0:41:09] <%Ixiah> maybe its like rat cant swim LUL
[0:41:09] <%Mister_McDerp> bad is good
[0:41:11] <%Pookiedaexzile> Because Knights Only is fun
[0:41:11] <CptHarlok> Wait, what?
[0:41:11] <$Jaxnos> are they saying that just because of powerstance?
[0:41:11] <ne_zha> It's just people who started with DS2 somehow have to defend it every chance they get
[0:41:13] <%nanaki_ff14> Dark Souls 2 is the best Souls Like thats not Dark Souls
[0:41:14] <%BinaryFireball> I think it's a psyop
[0:41:15] <thatdudenamedlogan> Dark Souls 2 has rats; This game has rats
[0:41:16] <V0LK__> every from soft launch we get all these crazy tweets LUL
[0:41:16] <Finchit> elden shows how great ds2 is yea
[0:41:16] <+froduck42> the enviroment guy for ds2 did the envioments for elden ring
[0:41:17] <nesbitt22> EXPLAIN
[0:41:18] <+Shishi1205> enemy swarms
[0:41:20] <+wekisonfire> it has 2handing and pharros lockstones its exactly the same game
[0:41:21] <vonmaultke> Variety? i dunno
[0:41:21] <$Solid_Stro> DS2 better UX sabert14Smug
[0:41:21] <U_l_f_b_e_r_h_t> Elden Ring is what DS2 whated to be.
[0:41:21] <thatdudenamedlogan> It's the rats man
[0:41:24] <Ner234> I mean I LIKE DS2 but I'm not seeing what ....
[0:41:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> Well see if you mash the good parts of DS2 with the good parts of DS1 and DS3 you get a good game
[0:41:25] <%barrakuta371> I think I know what they mean, but how they got there is baffling
[0:41:29] <doster504> @Blank9 bone fist bone fist is so fun
[0:41:32] <%fat_burtreynolds> That’s like Kojima gaslighting everyone into liking MSG2
[0:41:32] <mihokspawn> A false equivalency made by hbomberguy as per usual :D
[0:41:33] <jacksawjack> 90% of the enemies are dudes in armor
[0:41:38] <DigiDom> thanks, just finished last night after 176 hours and I'm looking forward to pats reaction to the final few bosses
[0:41:42] <thatdudenamedlogan> I'm telling ya, it's because of the rats
[0:41:43] <%CoffeeKaiju> hipsters
[0:41:44] <NewWillinium> . .Hey wait. Why did the Fire Monk just use Mohg's Blood Thorn Sorcery?
[0:41:44] <V0LK__> ADAPTABILTY!
[0:41:44] <%BinaryFireball> you know what, I bet those people ONLY played DS2
[0:41:45] <+pugszerosugar> Powerstance🤔🤔🤔. Lol.
[0:41:46] <%notsoy> that would be like DMC5 making people saying DmC was the best game lmao
[0:41:47] <%SaiyanShoto> People always like to like the bad shit just because they want to be different
[0:41:52] <thatdudenamedlogan> More rats = Better game
[0:41:53] <%JonathLP> Except Ornstein
[0:41:54] <+Shishi1205> these enemies are weird
[0:41:56] <LMTTN> The worst was someone calling that elevator up to the lava area "go
[0:41:56] <MaritimeSpanker> real shame,  because that game has a few memorable moments
[0:42:00] <MaritimeSpanker> like Looking glass knight
[0:42:01] <+Shishi1205> yeah
[0:42:01] <LMTTN> *good
[0:42:03] <%JonathLP> Red Ornenstein > Gold Orenstein
[0:42:04] <+Horosho> dangerous levels of copium from DS2 fans
[0:42:06] <+Shishi1205> I dont understand it either
[0:42:06] <%nanaki_ff14> yeah showed the name for me too
[0:42:06] <sleepy_pink> I really don't know why these folks have names
[0:42:07] <%SveriSageAdvice> i literally cant tell why that name is like that
[0:42:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> you just killed a real person IRL
[0:42:13] <rosabellamelantha> there ARE parts of DS2 in elden rings's DNA but that doesn't really change DS2 as a game?
[0:42:14] <tentavision> I've heard lots of people compare them but i never heard any specifics
[0:42:15] <doster504> @notsoy some people did do that people will say anything for internet to go boing
[0:42:16] <+Shishi1205> missed the rat
[0:42:16] <MaritimeSpanker> uuuh
[0:42:18] <nesbitt22> Pat stop shotting enemies
[0:42:18] <lyzejag> But Pat shit taste nice you just need to eat it everyday it's fine I promise
[0:42:18] <zenith0111> These NPC enemies are weird
[0:42:21] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> @notsoy DmC is the 2nd best DMC game after 5 :tho
[0:42:22] <$EsotericOdyssey> @BinaryFireball *person who has only played DS@*: Hmm, Elden Ring sure has some DS2 vibes.
[0:42:27] <%BinaryFireball> man I do miss lucatiel though
[0:42:32] <PunkZedB> it's probably how they set up npc enemies and couldn't be bothered to change it
[0:42:34] <%nanaki_ff14> Guard Break carried me most the game
[0:42:36] <MaritimeSpanker> maybe they are tied into the ending nobody's found yet?
[0:42:41] <%BinaryFireball> exactly @esotericodyssey
[0:42:47] <Parapattern> Can't be the smartest person in the room if you agree with the most widely held opinion
[0:42:48] <dustyroads> Need zullie to explain that name
[0:42:54] <tuesti> the only good take I've seen is "Didn't like ER? You'll love Dragon's Dogma! Loved ER? You'll love Dragon's Dogma!"
[0:42:56] <+orochiblood> Pat are you gonna play Stranger of Paradise
[0:43:06] <LMTTN> @PatStaresAt Is DS2 your least favorite of the Soulsbornes?
[0:43:21] <+ipaintwithcolor> @tuesti all i want is dd2
[0:43:23] <Jmann1892> DS2 is the bad game in a series full of bangers.
[0:43:24] <%X2Eliah> Yeah guard counter moveset is important. Some weapons (like halberds) really suck, because their guard counter misses a whole ton
[0:43:25] <+J_PewPew> EWww no
[0:43:25] <yyyyfdugyu> C H A O S
[0:43:26] <%JonathLP> Stranger of Paradise looks like a hot mess and I can't wait
[0:43:27] <+Aokaay> i used the default vagabond sword the entire game for the guard counters it was great
[0:43:32] <NewWillinium> I oddly enough dislike DS 3 the most.
[0:43:35] <MaritimeSpanker> I do appreciate how pat has tried out very many different weapons during his play
[0:43:37] <Aussie_Manny> Pat will play just enough to KILL CHAOS, right?
[0:43:38] <+tar2ffe> I'd love to play Stranger but I really need to finish Forbidden West
[0:43:40] <%BinaryFireball> straight swords have always been underrated
[0:43:41] <%SveriSageAdvice> DS2 went too hard on the "haha you're gonna die over and over again, that's what makes these games good right?"
[0:43:42] <ape_hawk> is that why you had woolie start with DS2?
[0:43:42] <oda_flobunaga> Well, its a dex weapon
[0:43:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> does the name mean they're Tarnished?
[0:43:45] <+orochiblood> the SoP demo has the FFXIV level and its nuts
[0:43:46] <sleepy_pink> nope
[0:43:47] <rosabellamelantha> Mine is DS3 personally but I think DS2 and 3 are kinda in a similar range
[0:43:47] <%Pookiedaexzile> Well She One Handed it
[0:43:48] <+tar2ffe> Elden took it's attention
[0:43:48] <+Shishi1205> no
[0:43:49] <%SveriSageAdvice> @PatStaresAt look around a bit more
[0:43:50] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt NO
[0:43:53] <%SveriSageAdvice> there you go lol
[0:43:53] <%Pookiedaexzile> And everything else
[0:43:54] <Trace_Bovier> where does Bloodborne sit for you now?
[0:43:54] <V0LK__> there's always a big chest reward right?
[0:43:54] <$EsotericOdyssey> no
[0:43:55] <zenith0111> I finally beat Dragons Dogma and all I have to say is that it didnt age well
[0:43:59] <LMTTN> DS2 had moments but they were just moments. I only played a tiny bit of 3 because I was just really burned out on the formula then
[0:43:59] <EasternEagle21> Elden Ring would be my favorite if I didn't find the boss fights in it to be so entirely awful half the time.
[0:44:00] <+Cuon_Alpinus> DS2 was the best because it had the best pvp and build variety
[0:44:05] <tuesti> @tuesti i dream of DD2 every night
[0:44:05] <+RedMaskBandit> PokBlaziken
[0:44:06] <doster504> wait is it not the whole fort
[0:44:06] <bassoontyphoon> Non
[0:44:10] <+jingokrieg> Hey pat, to comabt my rage quits from Elden Ring I've taken to playing a chapter of FF7R, I'm on chapter 17.....
[0:44:11] <+Shishi1205> Pat check this shield shit
[0:44:12] <doster504> BRUH COME ON
[0:44:14] <%CoffeeKaiju> skull
[0:44:15] <%SveriSageAdvice> it took me longer than im willing to admit to find that
[0:44:17] <%Dakuu75> has pat gotten all the deathroots? (I'm curious what happens)
[0:44:20] <LMTTN> Dragon's Dogma 2 or Deep Down
[0:44:20] <Blank9> dragon's dogma mainly shines in the dlc area
[0:44:24] <rosabellamelantha> I also don't agree that DS2 is a bad game like at all
[0:44:26] <Finchit> its gonna be an mmo
[0:44:29] <ohno58> Maybe Deep Down will come back?
[0:44:30] <MaritimeSpanker> Drag ma Dong son 2
[0:44:32] <+ipaintwithcolor> it exists and it is finished they are simply holding us back
[0:44:33] <+Shishi1205> lmao
[0:44:34] <$EsotericOdyssey> @doster504 POINT AT HIM AND LAUGH AT HIS BLINDNESS
[0:44:35] <Ner234> COPIUM
[0:44:35] <%Dakuu75> DAAAAAAAAAAAAMN
[0:44:36] <zenith0111> Dragons Dogma 2 would be lit tho ngp
[0:44:37] <Ghufufin> Dragons Copium 2
[0:44:39] <%notsoy> WOW that spell FUCKS
[0:44:40] <zenith0111> ngl*
[0:44:43] <Aussie_Manny> OH GOD
[0:44:44] <theghosttcatt> this guy got all the damn tricks
[0:44:45] <%BinaryFireball> yea but do we really need that game?
[0:44:49] <%fat_burtreynolds> Godhand 3
[0:44:51] <+Shishi1205> It has a grenade launcher inside btw
[0:44:51] <Parapattern> How did it do that MUCH DAMAGE
[0:44:52] <TheBlankAce> Itsuno will just reveal it and it'll come out 3 months later
[0:44:53] <+Shishi1205> I checked
[0:44:54] <%nanaki_ff14> See the trailer for Dragons Dogma online?
[0:44:57] <+Aokaay> 1 hit wow
[0:44:57] <+pugszerosugar> Crazy talk active
[0:45:00] <%dekkitout> We finna link some flames?
[0:45:04] <LMTTN> Was there any hope of Deep Down ever happening lmao
[0:45:06] <tanarath> @dakuu75 yes, the guy teleports away & gives you one last thing.
[0:45:09] <%BinaryFireball> dear flame
[0:45:11] <%Cigwynn> I mean, this is a Crucible
[0:45:15] <MaritimeSpanker> Flame dear flame
[0:45:16] <Pt_Kamen> Fire and Ice?
[0:45:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> fire is cool
[0:45:28] <KatabolicRage> It allowed civilization to exist
[0:45:28] <MoonObscure> indeed
[0:45:29] <doster504> @doster504 that layout doesn't even make sense lmao did a whole regiment of soldiers have to do that hop
[0:45:32] <%dekkitout> Literally every culture
[0:45:32] <%mythcreant> dis tru
[0:45:32] <$Trenr> and for several good reasons
[0:45:33] <Finchit> name 5 examples then
[0:45:37] <MaritimeSpanker> yeah
[0:45:39] <+ipaintwithcolor> fire good
[0:45:40] <ape_hawk> flame has a lot of meanings
[0:45:41] <MaritimeSpanker> Fire of the gods and all that
[0:45:41] <+tar2ffe> Fire or Light
[0:45:44] <$EsotericOdyssey> fire's nice
[0:45:45] <%BinaryFireball> flame is the thing we told stories by
[0:45:46] <$EsotericOdyssey> keeps you warm
[0:45:47] <Trace_Bovier> fire go brrrr
[0:45:48] <$EsotericOdyssey> cook food
[0:45:49] <%Nobrev> fire is basically magic
[0:45:50] <$EsotericOdyssey> make light
[0:45:50] <$Solid_Stro> Fire important
[0:45:50] <%BinaryFireball> so yea
[0:45:50] <%JustToWatch> 2nd most, the first is actually bofa
[0:46:02] <tentavision> correct
[0:46:07] <+Drigoooooo> humans basically worship fire in all facets of life
[0:46:08] <$EsotericOdyssey> @Trace_Bovier no, fire make you NOT go brr, because warm instead of cold
[0:46:09] <+Shishi1205> yeah
[0:46:20] <%Mister_McDerp> yep
[0:46:21] <Finchit> okay 4 more examples
[0:46:22] <%Pookiedaexzile> Who the fuck did we steal fire from
[0:46:22] <%Deadpal> yeah cause lightning "gave us fire"
[0:46:24] <oda_flobunaga> THe Theft of Fire is the primeval archetype
[0:46:31] <+Shishi1205> I mean prehistoric humans would have done it too
[0:46:38] <%Deadpal> @Pookiedaexzile Lightning causing fires in the plains
[0:46:39] <+ipaintwithcolor> fire is a good invention but have you heard about the internet
[0:46:40] <KatabolicRage> also no other animals can really wield it I think?
[0:46:40] <Pt_Kamen> Fire = Power
[0:46:41] <+Shishi1205> like "steal" it
[0:46:42] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt it's almost like humans connection with flame is one of the main reasons we as a species progressed
[0:46:45] <knotsundownsyndrome> genuinely curious about how other cultures do the theft of fire
[0:46:46] <kingra> Fire is fucked up
[0:46:48] <%dekkitout> Fire, floods, and stars
[0:46:48] <%BinaryFireball> man never made it, they found it first
[0:46:48] <%Deadpal> so if we took that and created our OWN fires
[0:46:49] <DigiDom> fire only exist on earth
[0:46:49] <zenith0111> Fire was the first killer app Kappa
[0:46:50] <Gray_LoFi> Oh wow, there's a whole wikipedia article on Theft of Fire, huh
[0:46:51] <%Deadpal> we "stole" fire.
[0:46:51] <megaman_sentinel> fire equals power
[0:46:52] <+tar2ffe> With Fire and Cooking you get nutrients to the primitive humans, developing intelligence
[0:46:55] <LMTTN> society
[0:46:55] <%twohitgood> universal meme: steal fire.
[0:46:59] <%Cozy90> we didn't Start the fire
[0:47:02] <knotsundownsyndrome> it's true but i am liegitimately curious on a little lesson
[0:47:02] <MaritimeSpanker> no fire = no food or heat
[0:47:04] <%Valdorick> Get destroyed
[0:47:04] <%Deadpal> Stealing fire from lightning strikes and keeping it alive.
[0:47:06] <V0LK__> that seems fair and balanced LUL
[0:47:07] <kingra> ANIME POWERS???
[0:47:09] <lyzejag> 5600 DAMAGE FUCK
[0:47:09] <%sniffy77> cooked food also had important effects on human evolution
[0:47:10] <fishmonger555> Wait, when did Pat fight Malenia??
[0:47:11] <klooswep> casual 5645 damage combo
[0:47:11] <%fat_burtreynolds> Lol said random bush fire lmao
[0:47:13] <ape_hawk> penis shield
[0:47:14] <MaritimeSpanker> christ, that sword fucks
[0:47:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> tricksome Kappa
[0:47:20] <%Valdorick> One Eyed Shield is my best move
[0:47:22] <NewWillinium> Fire has a **LOT** of symbolic meaning as well. It can mean just about anything. Including the Flame of Knowledge and the Flame of Ambition
[0:47:26] <+Shishi1205> yep
[0:47:27] <%Spyke889> Spyke889 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[0:47:29] <%solracc25> fire = food
[0:47:29] <%Pookiedaexzile> Whose gonna win, Fire Wizard or One Silly Button
[0:47:30] <megaman_sentinel> and another thing why I need games Giants are always considered evil
[0:47:31] <%Cozy90> Canon shield woot
[0:47:31] <%NBUsagi> Gun?!
[0:47:33] <%notsoy> what are the stats for it anyway
[0:47:36] <%Rbeatononefour> a MonHun weapon
[0:47:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> too weak to pull the trigger LUL
[0:47:43] <+Shishi1205> mortar/cannon
[0:47:43] <Ghufufin> lol its literally a gun
[0:47:44] <sleepy_pink> so much strength
[0:47:44] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @megaman_sentinel greek mythology
[0:47:45] <senfood> That shield SLAPS
[0:47:46] <zenith0111> I love how it straight says Evil Entity
[0:47:49] <%Kevlar_Caviar> that's why
[0:47:49] <bassoontyphoon> GUN
[0:47:54] <MaritimeSpanker> he could've been a good god and malena just went "naaaw dude"
[0:47:57] <$EsotericOdyssey> @NBUsagi not even the only gun in the game
[0:47:57] <tanarath> Pat, I suspect it was the foundational thoughts behind fire, namely that the world could be controlled/destroyed/managed for us.
[0:48:01] <%BinaryFireball> there is literally a gun in this game
[0:48:01] <megaman_sentinel> oh yeah that
[0:48:02] <sleepy_pink> waiting for shield only NG+ runs
[0:48:03] <%octavian_wolf> just watched that Malenia kill, GOOD JOB
[0:48:04] <$EsotericOdyssey> remember the Jar Cannon
[0:48:09] <DigiDom> fires is pretty cool. natural fire needs fuel and oxygen so it only really exists on this planet
[0:48:10] <zenith0111> Its good ass shield is why
[0:48:14] <+Shishi1205> To turtle pope
[0:48:27] <lyzejag> Pope ope oeppe turle
[0:48:29] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt that animation for the gun was right out of MH
[0:48:31] <sleepy_pink> giantsflame take thee is so good
[0:48:32] <%Kevlar_Caviar> YEEEAAAHHH
[0:48:32] <%mythcreant> TURTL POP
[0:48:35] <+tar2ffe> What Talisman you rocking Pat?
[0:48:37] <MaritimeSpanker> there's a rune on the book
[0:48:40] <%BinaryFireball> I wonder if there is turtle antipope
[0:48:41] <%cade_calrayn> ALL HAIL THE TURTLE POPE
[0:48:41] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt Ii like how you can puzzle-piece the Great Runes together into the full Elden Ring
[0:48:44] <%Cozy90> cause thats what he is
[0:48:44] <%cade_calrayn> LONG MAY HE REIGN
[0:48:44] <%sniffy77> THATS WHAT HE IS
[0:48:45] <knotsundownsyndrome> is turtle pope the friendliest NPC in the series so far?
[0:48:46] <%Valdorick> I mean, we call it like w esee it
[0:48:47] <kingra> Cause that's what he is
[0:48:47] <%Pookiedaexzile> I mean Look at em
[0:48:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> I mean just look at him
[0:48:53] <doster504> god
[0:48:53] <zenith0111> Dog Pope
[0:48:53] <%mythcreant> awwww
[0:48:53] <MaritimeSpanker> T'pope
[0:48:55] <bassoontyphoon> Dog Pope Dog Pope
[0:48:56] <knotsundownsyndrome> it feels like there's no one friendlier than the turtle pope
[0:48:58] <Ghufufin> its accurate and funny
[0:48:59] <+Shishi1205> best spell teacher (faith side) easy
[0:48:59] <theghosttcatt> i like that hes just down to learn together with you
[0:49:00] <klooswep> Dog priest! FeelsGoodMan
[0:49:02] <%nanaki_ff14> Dosn't give you shit for bringing hertical books. He's like yeah lets learn this satanic shit together!
[0:49:03] <lyzejag> YEYEYE
[0:49:07] <%Rbeatononefour> great narrator voice on this fella
[0:49:07] <tanarath> TURTLE POPE
[0:49:10] <lyzejag> Looks big and cool
[0:49:11] <%Saadi90> I wish the real pope was a turtle
[0:49:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Turtle Pope is the greatest NPC in gaming
[0:49:20] <megaman_sentinel> you just have to believe and you can throw fireballs too
[0:49:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> I will not hear any arguments to the contrary
[0:49:25] <Slimeking_Mike> miriel is such a sweetheart
[0:49:29] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt if you hit turtle pope and stop he forgives you, and asks that you learn to control yourself because not everyone is understanding
[0:49:32] <klooswep> The spell is literally called "Giant's flame take thee" I love this game
[0:49:36] <lyzejag> JESUS
[0:49:38] <LMTTN> I wonder if there was a point in this game's development where you could only fast travel at grace sites
[0:49:39] <%luftraumm1> Turtle pope is the single most beautiful thing in this game
[0:49:39] <%Kevlar_Caviar> WOW
[0:49:41] <%Kevlar_Caviar> THAT'S BIG
[0:49:41] <+Shishi1205> damn a nuke
[0:49:42] <%Rbeatononefour> fuego!
[0:49:43] <%Valdorick> Fireball has never BEEN bigger
[0:49:43] <%fat_burtreynolds> Take my money turtle pipe psaGib
[0:49:43] <bassoontyphoon> If his hat was instead hair, he would basically just be Polnareff
[0:49:48] <+ipaintwithcolor> godslayer seal
[0:49:49] <MaritimeSpanker> BIGGE
[0:49:50] <+tar2ffe> 40 Faith? Fell of the Flame God?
[0:49:51] <lyzejag> That's a fucking nuke
[0:49:55] <%Felhad> What if dog pope is the intro narrator
[0:50:03] <%luftraumm1> is there a dex/faith seal?
[0:50:04] <CptHarlok> Don't you mean "Dog pope?"
[0:50:07] <Sunstalker> @PatStaresAt there's a dagger that also buffs beast miracles. Its a unique so you can't swap the weapon art though. it has quickstep
[0:50:09] <%Valdorick> Two Finger Seal is basic, but strong.
[0:50:17] <%JustToWatch> what about a Walrus
[0:50:19] <MaritimeSpanker> Get the Seal of Metatron
[0:50:28] <%tetraes> Gravel Seal makes lightning sPear slap @PatStaresAt
[0:50:36] <MaritimeSpanker> Or Suchma's seal
[0:50:37] <%BinaryFireball> man I wish the walking mausoleums combines into giant Mecha mausoleum boss
[0:50:51] <%Deadpal> ayyyy
[0:50:54] <Born_2_Late> i dunno why i find the bimblo scrimblo stuff so funny but damn it still gets me
[0:51:03] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i love this guy, but nothing beats the weird utterance of "EY TIS WAT NEE" when you skip through andre's dialogue in ds3 LUL
[0:51:16] <%Valdorick> Dex Faith is pretty baller
[0:51:18] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt there's a new elden ring skip that lets you go right to the final zone after the volcano manor warp
[0:51:19] <+Shishi1205> oh yeah
[0:51:20] <sleepy_pink> real fucking dank
[0:51:21] <doster504> bear seek seek lest
[0:51:22] <%Mantorok06> golden deal scales to S on both attributes
[0:51:26] <zenith0111> I found a dagger and I got it to +24 but the final upgrade has worse stats. Whats the deal?
[0:51:27] <+Drigoooooo> yup all the good faith weapons are endgame
[0:51:27] <klooswep> +2% is still more than +0%
[0:51:27] <%Valdorick> Good news, that DANK WEAPON, is Faith/Dex!
[0:51:28] <Wakerz140> This is quite probably
[0:51:32] <%luftraumm1> bimblo scrimblo is one of the most important new memes to come from fromsoft
[0:51:35] <MaritimeSpanker> More dank than the ones you've already seen?
[0:51:36] <+Shishi1205> @rosabellamelantha jesus

[0:54:05] <%dekkitout> The dead rune's that centipede crest thing right?
[0:54:08] <klooswep> The lore of the hands is that Miyazaki and GRRM outsourced some of the writing to Yoshikage Kira
[0:54:08] <MaritimeSpanker> Why is it always the giants that get treated like shit?
[0:54:09] <+Shishi1205> @Lulu19 no, he is exploring

[0:55:14] <%TheAdMerlin> Chat doesn't seem to be yelling about missing a good weapon or armor so that seems like a fine choice
[0:55:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> fuck em
[0:55:27] <jacksawjack> Why are all their abdominal cavities empty?

[0:55:38] <+LandOfTheWay> damn, late again. how goes it so far?
[0:55:39] <%secretspud> Beat that Fire's ass
[0:55:40] <+vaderxyz1970> Trolls joined the winning side
[0:55:48] <zenith0111> @theadmerlin According to achievement trackers only like 5% of people are progging in this area
[0:55:50] <MaritimeSpanker> Wait, so did the Trolls betray the giants then, and that's why they're allowed in the lower lands?
[0:55:55] <$EsotericOdyssey> pat please look at the corrpses
[0:55:56] <%Felhad> Trolls betray
[0:55:58] <$EsotericOdyssey> check theirr wrists
[0:56:00] <sirrice77> Okay but if the trolls changed side why they treated like shit?
[0:56:01] <$Solid_Stro> We beat that fire up super good
[0:56:01] <%MaybeFalco> all progress towards the scrimblo bo bimbli
[0:56:02] <%Kevlar_Caviar> his brain is churning
[0:56:02] <%Dakuu75> @vaderxyz1970 it doesn't look like it. lol
[0:56:05] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i can tell
[0:56:10] <%Pookiedaexzile> Trolls Traded that's why their gutless
[0:56:11] <yyyyfdugyu> we do a little trolling
[0:56:14] <MaritimeSpanker> still makes me wonder about the hollow innards, that's sch a connection between all big enemies
[0:56:14] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt Godfrey had the souls boss kill ui show up when he killed the last giant
[0:56:16] <$EsotericOdyssey> are they missing their hands?
[0:56:17] <%Kevlar_Caviar> maybe??????
[0:56:17] <NewWillinium> Maaaaybe
[0:56:17] <Sunstalker> Always
[0:56:18] <%Valdorick> The Giants were Giants.
[0:56:19] <BigBruthaThunda> why
[0:56:20] <@Fuggins4U> i just ate shrimp, hi
[0:56:21] <%Cigwynn> I think they were
[0:56:22] <+vaderxyz1970> Super cool
[0:56:23] <technodribble> Very cool
[0:56:23] <%Dakuu75> idk but, probably
[0:56:23] <%Mister_McDerp> big thinkin
[0:56:23] <GrenYena> They're pretty cool now Kappa
[0:56:24] <zenith0111> Maybe
[0:56:25] <%cade_calrayn> Genuinely don't know
[0:56:25] <%JonathLP> Who knows? They're really fucking dead now
[0:56:26] <%dekkitout> Untill the Fire Nation pulled up
[0:56:26] <+Drigoooooo> I doubt the Giants were good people either
[0:56:26] <sleepy_pink> the giants and the demihumans were the original denizens of the lands between
[0:56:26] <kingra> Probably
[0:56:26] <%Daskolin> Giants were super COOL
[0:56:26] <+Smokebanshee> Probably not
[0:56:27] <%LaughingCatt> they are now lobosEZ
[0:56:27] <TheBlankAce> The giants are always cool
[0:56:28] <%secretspud> A couple seemed alright, but  they were mostly fucks
[0:56:29] <klooswep> They're pretty cool now! nyuk nyuk nyuk
[0:56:31] <%cade_calrayn> It's never said
[0:56:31] <%BinaryFireball> nah they were hot
[0:56:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> giants are always cool
[0:56:31] <Parapattern> No. They were lame.
[0:56:31] <%Kevlar_Caviar> LUL
[0:56:32] <+twdlrr> so did their Gwyn just like huck a bunch of branches at the giants?
[0:56:33] <sendart> they were hot
[0:56:35] <PunkZedB> didst thou belong?
[0:56:35] <+tar2ffe> Chat, Red Cursed guy in roundtable by ball bearing lady. leave him be or kill?
[0:56:36] <$EsotericOdyssey> no
[0:56:37] <%Valdorick> Are the Giants the painting girl's first race? *maybe*
[0:56:38] <+chaggles> the answer is always yes
[0:56:40] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt the giants opposed the erdtree which was enough to genocide them apparently
[0:56:40] <+5Two> They looked like giant vikings
[0:56:40] <CptHarlok> You're going to find out
[0:56:41] <%sniffy77> Giants always get fucked over in fromsoft games
[0:56:42] <lyzejag> Maybe, surely before they got fucking annihilated. I guess
[0:56:43] <$EsotericOdyssey> they served a Fell-Flame God
[0:56:43] <%BinaryFireball> fucking sexy hot ass giants
[0:56:43] <MaritimeSpanker> Maybe
[0:56:44] <technodribble> They give the best hugs
[0:56:45] <@Fuggins4U> why is Pat a Gold Experience?
[0:56:47] <%AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> The blacksmith guy’s cool
[0:56:47] <Ghufufin> was the beast incantation guy a giant?
[0:56:48] <doster504> their land is not peaceful
[0:56:50] <Finchit> so wait, giants came before the erdtree according to that memorial?
[0:56:52] <%luftraumm1> an arm
[0:56:56] <%fat_burtreynolds> Strong I am forge I can
[0:56:56] <%luftraumm1> look back there
[0:56:57] <NFTbad> Iji was nice, so they're not inherently evil or nothin
[0:57:00] <%Felhad> The missing stomachs is because they were too lazy to make two models for the ones impaled pulling the carts psaDab
[0:57:01] <NewWillinium> Going off of that, if I had to guess I would guess that if I had to force it into Souls, that this takes place after the "Let Fire Fade" ending
[0:57:05] <sleepy_pink> "well have fun with that"
[0:57:07] <+Shishi1205> INCOMING
[0:57:07] <+tar2ffe> Do you have "Flame of the Fell God"
[0:57:08] <%secretspud> The god's couldn't stand the mighty clapping of their ass cheeks
[0:57:09] <sleepy_pink> trolls are not giants
[0:57:09] <%luftraumm1> some of these have broken off arms
[0:57:10] <$EsotericOdyssey> @Finchit yeah
[0:57:10] <Aussie_Manny> doodNoThx
[0:57:14] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt I believe it's never explained much beyond that they opposed the Erdtree; i've yet to see an item that says they were good or evil
[0:57:15] <sjcodan> @finchit correct
[0:57:20] <%Valdorick> It is my firm belief the game takes place in the Painting Girl's world, made with the Dark Soul paint.
[0:57:20] <%dekkitout> From ds3?
[0:57:21] <Aussie_Manny> doodNoThx x2
[0:57:22] <$EsotericOdyssey> the age of the erdtree wasn't cemented until the Giants were slain
[0:57:22] <%SveriSageAdvice> @tar2ffe you can leave him be for an ending or kill to save an NPC that doesnt really sell anything useful, you get his stuff either way
[0:57:23] <MaritimeSpanker> There is a very tragic, melancholic feel about this place
[0:57:23] <%mythcreant> this place is kind of awful huh
[0:57:32] <MaritimeSpanker> like it FEELS wrong

[0:58:07] <%AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> The future is now old man
[0:58:13] <Aussie_Manny> Jetstream Sam's sword.
[0:58:14] <+Shishi1205> the WA is cool
[0:58:14] <LMTTN> Is split damage as much of a trap option in this as in Dark Souls?
[0:58:18] <Finchit> Okina, fromsoft's sonic OC
[0:58:18] <%BinaryFireball> did they patch arcane scaling yet?
[0:58:20] <+Con_fusedDX> once arcane is fixed it'll be dope
[0:58:21] <NewWillinium> . . The fuck is a Demon in this lore?
[0:58:26] <Sabbrewolf> the weapon art for river of blood is dope
[0:58:26] <Born_2_Late> hmmm
[0:58:33] <%dekkitout> Lotta blood and flame stuff, whachu trynna say game?

[0:58:38] <%BinaryFireball> I wanna do an arcane build so bad
[0:58:39] <+Drigoooooo> no the split damage is not a trap its a bug
[0:58:40] <+Shishi1205> checkl the moves
[0:58:40] <NewWillinium> Seriously what counts as a DEMON in this lore?
[0:58:43] <%hermitdab> i apologize if i'm behind but has Pat beat the scarlet rot lady?
[0:58:45] <PunkZedB> That's Jetsream Sam's sword
[0:58:48] <+Shishi1205> I think they are from sekkiro
[0:58:49] <Lulu19> did you respec into dex?
[0:58:50] <+tar2ffe> Special Katana vs Blood Slash Uchi?
[0:58:50] <%LaughingCatt> ultimate sip sip
[0:58:54] <$EsotericOdyssey> @NewWillinium as of yet undefined
[0:58:55] <%Valdorick> If it'll take you to +12, then yes, its the last sippy upgrade!
[0:58:58] <sjcodan> ARCANE LITERALLY DOESN'T WORK
[0:58:58] <doster504> @hermitdab ye
[0:58:58] <$EsotericOdyssey> may just mean "monster"
[0:59:03] <%AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Both?
[0:59:04] <oda_flobunaga> @BinaryFireball I just beat the game with Arcane, it was fun
[0:59:04] <%BinaryFireball> yup
[0:59:06] <%Cigwynn> Pat has never had more Kool-aid in his sippy cup
[0:59:07] <%tetraes> U can just use Blood infused weapons for Arcane
[0:59:10] <Sabbrewolf> I'm near end game been with an arcane build the whole time. It's just a few weapons that don't scale properly.
[0:59:10] <lyzejag> Talk to Melina !
[0:59:11] <$EsotericOdyssey> it sucks that one sword doesn't worrk
[0:59:11] <%hermitdab> @doster504 dope

[0:59:15] <Aussie_Manny> God, you literally obliterated Okina. I've seen people STRUGGLE against him, over and over. cmonBruh
[0:59:16] <%NBUsagi> Throw Rock too good
[0:59:21] <%anoldtoilet> @sjcodan it works sometimes on some things, seemingly randomly
[0:59:22] <%LaughingCatt> Arcane scaling works just find on weapons that dont have split damage
[0:59:29] <%BinaryFireball> @oda_flobunaga how did the scaling work for that?
[0:59:33] <Lulu19> rip to another str fth bro

[1:04:10] <+Shishi1205> try leg
[1:04:10] <doster504> giant fat roll
[1:04:11] <zenith0111> Is he using a shield or is that like a tool used for stoking fires?

[1:04:15] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Felhad I didn't say anything about what happens.

[1:06:23] <+LandOfTheWay> lmao

[1:06:24] <%NBUsagi> Fire god
[1:06:24] <BigBruthaThunda> you dont have the right
[1:06:25] <+RedMaskBandit> man needs some shea butter or something
[1:06:25] <%Felhad> fuckin lol
[1:06:26] <$EsotericOdyssey> didn't the shield say that their fire god had one eye?
[1:06:27] <%Mister_McDerp> SHARINGAN
[1:06:27] <NewWillinium> So THIS is why I think the Giants and Trolls all had their stomachs scooped out
[1:06:27] <$Jaxnos> LET IT ALL BUUUUUURN
[1:06:29] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt remember the one eyed god that was brought up earlier
[1:06:29] <klooswep> His chest face became his face face
[1:06:30] <cthulu_fearlock> ok
[1:06:30] <%soloshotfirst82> It's a blemmyes!
[1:06:31] <Lulu19> G VIRUS TIME

[1:06:33] <%EldritchBee> You killed paige last night, now it's time for you
[1:06:33] <%Rbeatononefour> wonder if he can eat you...
[1:06:34] <ergulor> baked pat yum
[1:06:35] <%Dakuu75> might be time for some fire-resist lol
[1:06:35] <ElSuperNova> Now he shmoovin
[1:06:35] <eleskei> so he was nauruto
[1:06:37] <$EsotericOdyssey> is that like, its GOD? in its chest-face?
[1:06:38] <zanzibarian_hamster> Leg god not to be fucked with
[1:06:38] <Midnight188> oh good i made it in time
[1:06:38] <%Mister_McDerp> DAMN UCHIHAS
[1:06:39] <%anoldtoilet> @NewWillinium ohhhhh
[1:06:39] <+wizard_of_diamonds> He held up the leg like it was an offering
[1:06:39] <mikesapartment> there is a closer one
[1:06:40] <+O2Linn> THIRD EYEEE!
[1:06:40] <+Shishi1205> there is
[1:06:41] <@Fuggins4U> can you summon mimic alongside the jar?
[1:06:43] <rosabellamelantha> there's a grace you missed
[1:06:43] <MaritimeSpanker> @PatStaresAt you were right with the connection of giants and firemonks, their armor has that face on it
[1:06:43] <DuckAlfred> That's fuckin cool
[1:06:44] <+Shishi1205> in the other chain
[1:06:47] <jubejube56> The giants were peaceful, their inhabitants kind
[1:06:47] <Mitchellsocks> Ok phase 2 I definitely am glad I was on Torrent
[1:06:49] <%Cigwynn> Pat demanded Woolie use Bring Me To Life for Pat
[1:06:51] <Slimeking_Mike> Hey that eye looks a lot like a rune, huh?
[1:06:51] <+silent__chief> You better watch the full cutscene each time
[1:07:00] <%fat_burtreynolds> Damn Amaterasu
[1:07:01] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt I think that its chest-face IS its god or w/e, and that's why it burnt its leg: as an offering
[1:07:01] <$Jaxnos> yeah, scooped out giant guts makes a lot of design sense given that
[1:07:01] <jacksawjack> Back to the dinner plate stage
[1:07:03] <%Felhad> @fuggins4u yes
[1:07:07] <+heiro001> welp, that was a lot
[1:07:07] <%dekkitout> So is he that one eyed god your shield mentioned?
[1:07:08] <+vaderxyz1970> You can also ride torrent in this fight
[1:07:08] <rosabellamelantha> left
[1:07:14] <rosabellamelantha> down the cliff
[1:07:15] <projecthazoid> Got a whiff of dat Uchiha
[1:07:16] <%thedankestmeeme> that is what we on the casual ff14 savage raiders like to call proggers
[1:07:17] <LMTTN> Is Torrent usable in the fight
[1:07:19] <@Fuggins4U> @Felhad ah good
[1:07:21] <%anoldtoilet> im like 80 hours into the game and only just now found a fire element ash of war
[1:07:26] <%anoldtoilet> so fire must be important here
[1:07:26] <%soloshotfirst82> That giant is based off an African mythological beast
[1:07:29] <Mitchellsocks> Yes Torrent is usable
[1:07:36] <zenith0111> @newwillinium Basically a lobotomy? I assume the giant face is the main brain
[1:07:37] <klooswep> true
[1:07:40] <+Shishi1205> true
[1:07:48] <%luftraumm1> no Alex?
[1:07:48] <mantyz> why not
[1:07:52] <$EsotericOdyssey> @dekkitout I think the Giant is just the last Giant, and the chest face IS the god, like the god occupies all the giants' chests
[1:07:58] <@Fuggins4U> you can do both
[1:08:00] <NewWillinium> @zenith0111 Maybe? Iji still seemed perfectly lucid
[1:08:01] <$EsotericOdyssey> or some weird shit
[1:08:04] <+Shishi1205> horse
[1:08:04] <%fat_burtreynolds> Wait for Alex
[1:08:05] <MartyFun11> His sign is at both entrances
[1:08:08] <+Based_Moose> Bring both
[1:08:10] <TheSinner42> you can do both
[1:08:10] <$EsotericOdyssey> and he had to burn his severed leg as an offering to wake it up
[1:08:11] <%Felhad> @patstaresat you can use alex and a summon
[1:08:11] <jubejube56> They do have churches of marika
[1:08:14] <digaogrunge> ALEX
[1:08:14] <%fat_burtreynolds> Or Summon
[1:08:16] <%shootbang_exe> do both
[1:08:16] <rosabellamelantha> @zenith0111 Spoilers kinda but the chest face is the god sealed in the last giant
[1:08:19] <$EsotericOdyssey> does that make sense?
[1:08:20] <BigFingerRo> I'm really digging the theme of bosses and such literally falling apart like a slab of rotten meat
[1:08:30] <@Fuggins4U> there we go
[1:08:30] <+ipaintwithcolor> Man this OST is so damn good
[1:08:35] <jacksawjack> Whatever happened to Blaidd
[1:08:38] <%anoldtoilet> i really like how big this fucking guy is lol
[1:08:42] <+Shishi1205> one eyed things are usually gods yes
[1:08:46] <+Drigoooooo> Blaidd died
[1:08:49] <%Pookiedaexzile> He has a Splint Now
[1:08:55] <%Pookiedaexzile> That shit was Cannon
[1:08:56] <+Shishi1205> The shield pat just god did say the one eyed god
[1:08:58] <%Valdorick> @dekkitout If you check the dead giants on the mountain, they all have faces on their stomachs. Also, normal Giants have a hole in their chest... where the eyeball would be.
[1:08:58] <bassoontyphoon> @jacksawjack he got sent to a farm upstate
[1:08:59] <KatabolicRage> oh he has a bone on his leg as a splint
[1:09:02] <oda_flobunaga> Do it Tall Pat
[1:09:02] <jacksawjack> @Drigoooooo that sucks
[1:09:05] <%Willowight> should have invested in a second anklet
[1:09:05] <MaritimeSpanker> How come none of the gods went after this guy?
[1:09:05] <+Aokaay> shame he doesn't ride the dish like a snowboard
[1:09:12] <ElSuperNova> Alex disables torrent so thats a thing I guess
[1:09:14] <adithehella> kinda sad you're already beating on his broken leg
[1:09:16] <zanzibarian_hamster> How wild must the giants have been if just this guy can whup you with his dinner bowl?
[1:09:19] <Geoblood> wait i know why his leg is a weak spot its because that leg is actually already broken thats why there is a bone wrapped around it
[1:09:23] <%anoldtoilet> @MaritimeSpanker someone is keeping him alive as a backup for something iirc
[1:09:26] <%secretspud> Attack on SummerSault!
[1:09:32] <%anoldtoilet> like hes the last one on purpose
[1:09:37] <BigFingerRo> like you are
[1:09:39] <MartyFun11> It's not just broken, it's half rotten away
[1:09:48] <%Felhad> Well she is a literal god
[1:09:48] <%fat_burtreynolds> Attack on Ankle
[1:09:49] <%LaughingCatt> she earned that God-Queen title
[1:09:50] <fishmonger555> @PatStaresAt you can also use Torrent during this fight, fyi
[1:09:52] <%Cigwynn> idk if Pat noticed, but you CAN mount up on Torrent in the boss arena
[1:09:52] <%cade_calrayn> Well, Godfrey did
[1:09:55] <%AsherCaelum> AsherCaelum subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[1:10:02] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt interesting to note is ER giants normally have a hole in their chest where that eye is
[1:10:04] <MartyFun11> You can use torrent if you don't summon alex
[1:10:05] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt That's why every other giant/troll has their chest/abdomen removed.
[1:10:06] <PunkZedB> it isn't even a named giant, just Fire Giant
[1:10:11] <%NBUsagi> I think this guy is also explicitly the vessel of that Fire God they talked abotu too
[1:10:11] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @MaritimeSpanker it's explained later
[1:10:12] <+Shishi1205> not with alex
[1:10:12] <%BinaryFireball> so does anyone know if he went into the sewers?
[1:10:12] <%solracc25> that leg did no damage
[1:10:20] <zenith0111> @newwillinium His mirror helm says it protects his toughts from the influence of the two fingers but Im not 100% if its related
[1:10:22] <MaritimeSpanker> righto
[1:10:29] <BigBruthaThunda> Torrent or Alex, not both
[1:10:30] <+Shishi1205> no horse with summon
[1:10:38] <$HyperionXV> Alex, Greg, and Pat. The gang's all here.
[1:10:38] <%anoldtoilet> scoop
[1:10:38] <%TheAdMerlin> I still prefer to think of Pat's mimic as Rick
[1:11:00] <%Valdorick> He's got a Brace on it, and you're damaging it.
[1:11:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> mans got a fat splint
[1:11:03] <NewWillinium> @BinaryFireball Yes he did. Yes he killed Dung Eater and the two other bosses
[1:11:04] <Sunstalker> Who's Alex? D: that's my name
[1:11:05] <Zourath> @BinaryFireball Yes, he did everything except go through the evil door.
[1:11:07] <%sniffy77> tfw the host dies to radahns metor attack :(
[1:11:13] <%fat_burtreynolds> @theadmerlin his name is definitely not Rick
[1:11:20] <%Cigwynn> Oh, can you not mount up with Alex here? I donked up the quest so I never would've known
[1:11:22] <NewWillinium> Where did he get the bone big enough to make that Splint?
[1:11:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> wait is he using someone elses leg bone as a splint?
[1:11:32] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> If somebody kicked me on my broken leg it would probably hurt quite a bit more than normal
[1:11:37] <+vaderxyz1970> @zenith0111 To avoid the Two Fingers wiggling menacing ly in their dreams
[1:11:37] <%AsherCaelum> Probably from another dead fire giant
[1:11:39] <Born_2_Late> love he he shuts down your ninja bs
[1:11:41] <sleepy_pink> @NewWillinium plenty of people around not using theirs
[1:11:44] <Gorgs7> what exactly is he smashing you with? That is not a shield... so is it just a big plate or what?
[1:11:45] <%Felhad> @cigwynn yup, no honse with Alex
[1:11:45] <BigFingerRo> MY LEG, I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO GET SWORDS IN IT
[1:11:46] <+Shishi1205> fun fact the mimic uses every item you have in your hot bar, including crabs
[1:11:48] <eleskei> that pot is full of rasberry jelly!
[1:11:53] <%fat_burtreynolds> He’s doing bayblade spins this Alex
[1:11:54] <%BinaryFireball> @newwillinium all the way to the jump puzzle?
[1:11:57] <+Shishi1205> like the ones you eat for phys defr
[1:11:57] <NewWillinium> @Gorgs7 I THINK it's a Lid of some sort
[1:12:00] <%YakumoYomi> He's got a face in his tum-tum
[1:12:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's already bending weird
[1:12:08] <MaritimeSpanker> Wait so their guts were torn out because they all had faces of fire on them?
[1:12:09] <NewWillinium> Yep
[1:12:10] <zanzibarian_hamster> People are ignoring that he bound that splint with his friggin beard hair, that's awesome
[1:12:12] <+Shishi1205> which can jank his AI
[1:12:14] <rosabellamelantha> Alex is TANKY
[1:12:16] <%Cigwynn> All those bods he stuffed in his guts
[1:12:16] <klooswep> He loses a ton of health right after the phase 2 cutscene. Probably because he tears his leg clean off
[1:12:21] <eleskei> alex is full of strawberry preserves
[1:12:21] <ExpressNode> He a fleshy lagaan
[1:12:23] <%anoldtoilet> it looks like some kind of ceremonial bowl or serving tray
[1:12:24] <Blank9> you feed your boy, he is growing strong
[1:12:25] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Alex is so much tankier here than he was with Radahn.
[1:12:25] <%NBUsagi> by the way holy shit this boss looks fuckin cool
[1:12:26] <MaritimeSpanker> and maybe the gods wanted the flame or just didn't like the idea of beings with it around
[1:12:27] <%BinaryFireball> Alex is a motherfucker
[1:12:27] <%anoldtoilet> oh shit
[1:12:28] <%Felhad> I dont think its big enough to be the lid of the Kiln
[1:12:31] <NewWillinium> You can also just keep beating his ass. He has trouble hitting you there
[1:12:31] <%anoldtoilet> what the fuck
[1:12:33] <+Shishi1205> @eleskei yes
[1:12:41] <%Valdorick> You're damaging his burned parts.
[1:12:41] <$EsotericOdyssey> well Godfrey was doing Marika's fighting, maybe that lion from godfrey's art took a big bite out of his leg?
[1:12:41] <sjcodan> see how he lost health because he ripped off the fucking leg?
[1:12:44] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I dont think pat saw you can Mount up on this one
[1:12:46] <%fat_burtreynolds> Toasty
[1:12:48] <+Shishi1205> @klooswep yes, he does tear it
[1:12:49] <+silent__chief> SO COOL
[1:12:51] <+MarkoTolstov> The plate thing he’s using is some sort of device, idk, I remember it in old chinese(?) paintings of Oni or giants. They were in Okami as well
[1:12:54] <%fat_burtreynolds> Toasty psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[1:12:56] <%anoldtoilet> ok giants have red hiar
[1:12:59] <Sunstalker> HE ATE THE CHILI PogChamp

[1:13:46] <ExpressNode> Did he respec into Dex or something?
[1:13:47] <$EsotericOdyssey> @anoldtoilet cursed by the giants iirc, is why he's a ginger
[1:13:48] <NewWillinium> I love that he Elbow Drops you

[1:14:06] <@Fuggins4U> ALWAYS RISES TO THE TOP
[1:14:08] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @Shishi1205 I can imagine!
[1:14:10] <%tetraes> Torrent
[1:14:11] <sendart> or on a horse
[1:14:12] <NewWillinium> Can you also cut off his hands?
[1:14:17] <+silent__chief> I beat him solo pretty easy
[1:14:18] <$Trenr> man's got hands
[1:14:18] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Torrent makes this fight a joke
[1:14:19] <+Smokebanshee> haha yeah it sucks
[1:14:19] <$OfficerMods> torrent
[1:14:20] <%Felhad> @tri3dge027 He is reforged from the magma of Mt Gelmir
[1:14:20] <doster504> yea horse
[1:14:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> Saw a dude Solo it naked
[1:14:22] <%SveriSageAdvice> unless you have a busted build, which i did lol
[1:14:23] <r0flwaffles> torrent makes this a cake walk
[1:14:24] <sirrice77> i mean i did it by myself in 3 tries so
[1:14:24] <zenith0111> Hes pretty easy tbh
[1:14:25] <MaritimeSpanker> GET HIM BUDDHA
[1:14:25] <+Aokaay> i never got alexander for this I'm sad
[1:14:26] <Mitchellsocks> It's a lot easier solo on Torrent
[1:14:28] <%Valdorick> Don't choke
[1:14:30] <%EldritchBee> Torrent is OP
[1:14:31] <doster504> I just hit his other foot for a bit
[1:14:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> NotLikeThis but summoning is cheating
[1:14:35] <%anoldtoilet> i bet sorcery can solo this guy
[1:14:37] <BigFingerRo> LEMME IN ON THOSE BALLS GURL
[1:14:38] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> It's completely fine solo, just torrent helps
[1:14:43] <klooswep> People are going to fight it level 1 solo anyways because people are crazy, but yeah it feels intended for coop/summons
[1:14:45] <oda_flobunaga> The spectacle fights are so good because they are still challenging
[1:14:45] <lyzejag> Let me taste that Gussy
[1:14:47] <%atlasdotwav> i cant wait for "every enemy replaced with Fire Giant" Mod
[1:14:51] <fishmonger555> Poke his tub
[1:14:55] <%fat_burtreynolds> the ollllllll Dick Twist
[1:14:55] <Gorgs7> I wonder if trolls etc. aren't missing their guts, but instead their faces
[1:15:00] <$OfficerMods> also barricade shield helps
[1:15:03] <BigBruthaThunda> 'Murica would be proud
[1:15:04] <%Cozy90> mimic-kun
[1:15:04] <Sunstalker> Greg with the killsteal
[1:15:05] <oda_flobunaga> Arcane solos this fight easy
[1:15:07] <+wizard_of_diamonds> gg
[1:15:07] <$OfficerMods> with fire res
[1:15:08] <%mythcreant> LEGEND FELLED
[1:15:09] <+Shishi1205> mimic putting in the work as always
[1:15:10] <%Valdorick> @atlasdotwav There's a worse one...
[1:15:12] <+silent__chief> @Gorgs7 holy shit
[1:15:14] <+orochiblood> Mimic did it, it doesnt count according to twitter
[1:15:15] <%Mister_McDerp> good job mimic!
[1:15:16] <%EldritchBee> Congrats, Pat! You made a species extinct!
[1:15:17] <$EsotericOdyssey> READ THE LORE
[1:15:18] <VeryTricky> you could summon the jar here!?
[1:15:21] <BigFingerRo> Ok but Alex is a champ
[1:15:22] <@DakotaMacDoodle> I Soloed it that was a mistake took forever forgot about summons dont know why but i did
[1:15:22] <%Nobrev> LEGEND FELLED
[1:15:23] <%fat_burtreynolds> Prodigious size does not dissuade from the sharpened blade
[1:15:25] <+hoenhime344> finAL???? sat it aint so
[1:15:27] <sirrice77> Do you think giants had to brush their stomach mouths?
[1:15:27] <NewWillinium> Now I think you meet Alex right here again if you reload or go do the Kiln fire.
[1:15:28] <@Fuggins4U> You're WCW champion now.
[1:15:28] <Mitchellsocks> But yeah, Torrent completely trivializes every move except the roll
[1:15:34] <BigFingerRo> NEVEW DIEW
[1:15:35] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt So THIS GUY cursed Radagon with his last breath which is why Radagon has red hair instead of blonde
[1:15:41] <%Valdorick> Some kind of... FIRST FLAME...
[1:15:42] <$OfficerMods> will pat do the funny?
[1:15:43] <%dekkitout> I bet Gwyn wished he had that
[1:15:43] <GrenYena> grace
[1:15:44] <%luftraumm1> no Alexander talk?
[1:15:51] <Lulu19> marika is big jerk th
[1:15:53] <+Missinglink91> Sigh, I really wish so many bosses weren't specifically designed around using summons/spirits
[1:15:56] <%fat_burtreynolds> Kayfabe never dies kekw
[1:15:58] <rosabellamelantha> He's here?
[1:15:59] <%luftraumm1> im asking btw
[1:16:01] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt maybe trolls etc. aren't missing their guts, but their faces
[1:16:04] <eleskei> they shoulve let u give torrent carrots and apples
[1:16:05] <+Shishi1205> is he?
[1:16:06] <NewWillinium> You may need to reload or do the nxt part for Alex
[1:16:08] <%tetraes> I thought that was next zone
[1:16:09] <$sarah_galb> reload maybe ?
[1:16:09] <%NBUsagi> It sounds like she cursed him with undeath so that she could alos seal the flame god or what ever in him too?
[1:16:14] <rosabellamelantha> I never saw him here
[1:16:22] <zenith0111> @missinglink91 Its a common opinion but I heavily disagree with it
[1:16:24] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I'm pretty sure he is on the next part
[1:16:24] <%luftraumm1> i'm asking if there is one i dunno
[1:16:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[1:16:29] <%JokerNewby> alex in next zone
[1:16:29] <+Shishi1205> the quest doesnt need this
[1:16:33] <TheBlankAce> No he doesn't show up here

[1:16:44] <oda_flobunaga> Alex is in the next zone
[1:16:46] <%EldritchBee> Alexander doesnt show up after the fight

[1:17:04] <+Missinglink91> @zenith0111 diasgree in what way?
[1:17:04] <klooswep> Cursing someone/an entire race to always need to tend to a flame for eternity. Now where have I heard that before?
[1:17:09] <+thegamekirby98> Alex shows up at his next location, this part doesnt even need to be done for progress his questline

[1:18:09] <Alrom> do a flip!
[1:18:09] <MartyFun11> Nope don't jump in
[1:18:09] <depressioncherrie> don't do what I did and jump down
[1:18:11] <NewWillinium> That looks like the Throne of Want from DS 2
[1:18:11] <bassoontyphoon> Pat just ignore the boyemployees
[1:18:12] <%SveriSageAdvice> it is not recommended to drop down
[1:18:13] <$OfficerMods> Do the funny

[1:18:24] <$Solid_Stro> Next to some snow Pat
[1:18:25] <rosabellamelantha> be wary of down
[1:18:27] <+CatRidder> is this the end of DS1?
[1:18:27] <tri3dgE027> LuL them backseating
[1:18:28] <doster504> yes
[1:18:29] <mantyz> other way
[1:18:30] <xDartuzax> There is a grace but there's no point in getting it
[1:18:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> but it looks so friendly down there
[1:18:32] <depressioncherrie> other direction, I believe, to the grace
[1:18:32] <eleskei> skybox looks rly close
[1:18:33] <+Rofiarf> you can make it!
[1:18:34] <lyzejag> DO A FLIP
[1:18:36] <+Shishi1205> @Shishi1205 yes
[1:18:37] <SQDizzy> DO A FLIP
[1:18:47] <zenith0111> @missinglink91 The fights can be done without summons just theyre so useful that its always a netgain using them so they see that as "essential" when its just better
[1:18:47] <+Shishi1205> killing the fire giant makes the quest end
[1:18:50] <kingra> LUL LuL LUL
[1:18:52] <Lulu19> THATS WHERE SPEHIROTH IS
[1:18:53] <%atlasdotwav> throw in the elden ring
[1:18:54] <oda_flobunaga> DO A BARREL ROLL
[1:18:56] <+TuskDeluxe> opinion on power stance dual blades?
[1:18:58] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> DON'T GET IN THE KILN
[1:19:04] <secret_npc> not even I can smoke this bowl
[1:19:06] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Almost as if it were for giants or something
[1:19:06] <@Fuggins4U> it's the olympic stadium
[1:19:07] <+CatRidder> needs more gywn
[1:19:09] <$OfficerMods> awww
[1:19:16] <tri3dgE027> ISILDUR, throw the ring~!  END IT NOW
[1:19:18] <+Shishi1205> I fell into it ngl
[1:19:19] <+heiro001> some sort of kiln of a giant first flame
[1:19:22] <+Shishi1205> It was kinda funny
[1:19:26] <%fat_burtreynolds> psaBig 420
[1:19:30] <%Valdorick> So the Fire Giant was cursed to be linked to a fire, and he's next to a massive kiln/vessel... hmmmmmmmm
[1:19:31] <%Deft_Thought> Probably held a lotta soup before it broke
[1:19:32] <$OfficerMods> BURN
[1:19:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> my theory is that this is another run through the Dark Souls cycle
[1:19:37] <fishmonger555> no three fingers?
[1:19:39] <17sevens> @zenith0111 massive understatement, some bosses are just designed in such a way that having no summon makes it just miserable
[1:19:39] <Tempmael> Ooh we elden lord now?
[1:19:41] <eleskei> is she hot
[1:19:41] <sirrice77> @Shishi1205 that's wrong? like you do all the stuff for goldmask up to this point. Then kill the giant and do the next zone, then get the rune from goldmask
[1:19:45] <%Valdorick> This shit IS just Dark Souls 2: 2
[1:19:45] <%anoldtoilet> lol
[1:19:46] <$OfficerMods> BURN ALL TREES 1999
[1:19:46] <@Fuggins4U> i love sin!
[1:19:48] <%luftraumm1> Sin me up baby
[1:19:49] <%NBUsagi> SIN SIN SIN
[1:19:50] <afrotoa> Yey Sin!!
[1:19:51] <+heiro001> yeah, sure.
[1:19:52] <%AsherCaelum> Wait, Melina, before you go, WHO ARE YOU
[1:19:52] <+vaderxyz1970> Are you prepared for ARSON?
[1:19:55] <President_Pariah> YUP YEP
[1:19:55] <%dmbender> yo ur maiden is asking you to sin
[1:19:56] <+CatRidder> kill them all pat
[1:19:58] <Tempmael> i need an adult
[1:19:59] <NewWillinium> @ReallyBigRocks I think this is what happens if you let the Fire Fade. A new light. A new path.
[1:20:00] <sirrice77> @Shishi1205 unless all that happens regardless of doing the quest?
[1:20:00] <PunkZedB> i'm so full of sin
[1:20:00] <%BinaryFireball> you ready to fuck?
[1:20:01] <klooswep> "Are you prepared to commit a cardinal sin" is my go-to pickup line
[1:20:01] <%NBUsagi> Fuck yeah, lets sin
[1:20:02] <afrotoa> crsGroove crsGroove crsGroove
[1:20:03] <%sniffy77> lewd
[1:20:04] <CptHarlok> Handholding, the cardinal sin.

[1:20:05] <+Missinglink91> @zenith0111 oh sure, you can do any of the bosses without them, that doesn't mean then design is with the intent of using them. But I've also just been overall disappointed with this game in general which I hate saying but it's the truth

[1:21:24] <%sniffy77> more like burntree
[1:21:25] <tri3dgE027> I'd imagine the original implementation for the Emerald Maiden from DS2 would  have been like this, having direct role within the narrative
[1:21:25] <BigFingerRo> BURN THAT BITCH TREE
[1:21:25] <+AyupaPupa> kinda hot ngl
[1:21:30] <+Akizea> @TheAdMerlin this is still on path for ranni ending

[1:21:51] <17sevens> the fire doesn't even have to touch it
[1:21:52] <megaman_sentinel> but I thought she wasn't a maiden

[1:27:52] <%HiroProtagonest> I mean a few things have been knocked over I guess...
[1:27:57] <+Shishi1205> so fun glitch she can be in two places at the same time
[1:27:57] <%notsoy> KNOTTED
[1:28:01] <BigFingerRo> I love the concept of hair whips, there is one in DS3 but it's for pyromancers so eh
[1:28:03] <DigiDom> time for sadness
[1:28:11] <%anoldtoilet> oh epic hes free?
[1:28:11] <+Shishi1205> I have a video of me running from her to her
[1:28:18] <BigFingerRo> but the idea of using hair to make a whip seems really appealing to me
[1:28:22] <Zeif00> BibleThump
[1:28:32] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @anoldtoilet "doesn't care about reading the lore", huh? LUL
[1:28:33] <+Aokaay> this glitched for me and she was in her original place at the same time
[1:28:34] <%cade_calrayn> Oh so the Giants *were* evil, then
[1:28:38] <%Felhad> @shishi1205 lol, I got that one
[1:28:40] <+Shishi1205> lord
[1:28:42] <%cade_calrayn> Or rather, they were forced to serve an evil god
[1:28:43] <%anoldtoilet> thats cute
[1:28:45] <Ghufufin> multiple pantheons
[1:28:51] <+Drigoooooo> Do it for Hewg
[1:28:51] <%anoldtoilet> i like that he changes to "i knew youd be back" and sounds happier
[1:28:54] <tri3dgE027> what a bro
[1:28:57] <%vexion_smh> fuck it imma buy this game it looks so fucking fun
[1:29:04] <%Valdorick> Talk to Rodikia again
[1:29:06] <%JonathLP> Hewg, a real one
[1:29:06] <+chaggles> hes the coolest
[1:29:07] <%dmbender> a true ride or die homie
[1:29:08] <%NBUsagi> Oh he is on the fuck these gods train, dope
[1:29:10] <+wizard_of_diamonds> And that's just the end of it. Awesome.
[1:29:11] <klooswep> Hewg is such a gigachad
[1:29:13] <+pectusumbra> You might say he has an axe to grind
[1:29:14] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt go back and forth with roderika
[1:29:14] <BigBruthaThunda> sad
[1:29:16] <%Valdorick> She's still a wet blaket
[1:29:20] <+Shishi1205> man nephelis quest is sad to see
[1:29:20] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Whats wrong with her?
[1:29:21] <%Dakuu75> seriously???
[1:29:21] <tri3dgE027> "Hey that weapon that WRECKED that Demigod?  That's MY SHIT" LuL
[1:29:21] <Mountaindrewdle> hewg is the best smith in the franchise
[1:29:25] <zenith0111> HOW DO YOU PROG IT
[1:29:26] <+Shishi1205> the noble's one too
[1:29:29] <+Shishi1205> yeah
[1:29:29] <%VictorVonLouche> Those two are my fave characters now
[1:29:29] <lyzejag> SigmaGrindset
[1:29:34] <+Shishi1205> we dont know
[1:29:39] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @PatStaresAt her quest and kenneth's quests are quite literally unfinished
[1:29:40] <%dekkitout> @tri3dgE027 Will smithy for exposure
[1:29:40] <Midnight188> why is a gold circle stuck on my screen? was that always there?
[1:29:44] <%Felhad> Hewg is best lad
[1:29:46] <sirrice77> He quest is either broken or like other npcs the next part just straight isnt in the game
[1:29:46] <blue8moon> at an earlier point in the game you can catch him praying and swearing to marika that he'll help end everything
[1:29:54] <Midnight188> is that like "you cant attack here" for the roundtable?
[1:29:55] <$EsotericOdyssey> @TurtlesAndTentacles quest appears to have had its original ending cut but they left the second to last step in for some fuckin reason
[1:29:55] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt he has more once you get destined death
[1:29:56] <BigBruthaThunda> her quest is either bugged or cut out
[1:29:57] <%Daskolin> In other words upgrade 25
[1:29:58] <xDartuzax> Mindbreak ending
[1:30:01] <Big_Dream> +25 weapon maybe @PatStaresAt
[1:30:03] <%Willowight> she sure did love curses
[1:30:04] <%justcallmebobplease> @Midnight188 Indicates you're in a no-combat zone.
[1:30:06] <%Mister_McDerp> always with the curses
[1:30:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Midnight188 yeah
[1:30:06] <digaogrunge> Have him make a +25 WEAPON?
[1:30:07] <tri3dgE027> @tri3dgE027 Artisan Builds Kappa
[1:30:11] <%ResoluteSky> dont you literally have a godslayer greatsword?
[1:30:12] <%anoldtoilet> seems like bugged
[1:30:20] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @EsotericOdyssey That's nuts
[1:30:27] <+Shishi1205> pat already has a +25 right?
[1:30:28] <%Felhad> +25 doesn't do anything
[1:30:30] <%dekkitout> Aw snap, he's institutionalized
[1:30:35] <klooswep> Does upgrading to +10 with somber have the same effect? Or is it only +25?
[1:30:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> just do it somewhere else bruh
[1:30:44] <%Valdorick> Don't forget to talk to Gideon
[1:30:48] <$EsotericOdyssey> @TurtlesAndTentacles other NPCs appear to have had their stuff cut down, it's just they were better about trimming off the original ending
[1:30:50] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt talk to gideon
[1:30:50] <+Shishi1205> its after finding dead chat
[1:30:53] <tolloponik> nope Not getting out of this CHAIR
[1:30:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> like literally anywhere else
[1:30:57] <$EsotericOdyssey> and they just missed Nepheli's for some reason
[1:30:58] <tri3dgE027> Talk to Ghideon?
[1:31:07] <+mikehuntis4timmy> you ccn sit in front of table if didnt know
[1:31:08] <$EsotericOdyssey> also yeah talk to Gideon
[1:31:09] <GrenYena> Wonder what Gideon thinks
[1:31:10] <%Valdorick> Just the 5
[1:31:11] <+Shishi1205> yeah
[1:31:11] <DigiDom> reload and talk to him agsin
[1:31:13] <+Shishi1205> like 4
[1:31:13] <+CatRidder> you need al the weapons to be +25 for the real ending like nier
[1:31:14] <%anoldtoilet> nepheli seems extremely impoirtant to the story
[1:31:16] <+Drigoooooo> yeah its sad how empty it is at the end
[1:31:17] <+Shishi1205> or 5 actually
[1:31:18] <%Valdorick> AND THE LOATHSOME DUNGEATER
[1:31:19] <+pectusumbra> I've only been in and out, has Pat killed the dung eater?
[1:31:20] <Sunstalker> Nope, this HUB sucks. Firelink Shrine remains king
[1:31:22] <knotsundownsyndrome> roundtable at this point in the game is really depressing
[1:31:22] <%anoldtoilet> so i think it might be bugged or will be added later
[1:31:22] <Wakerz140> Just the three or four or five
[1:31:26] <%anoldtoilet> its weird to just leave it out
[1:31:30] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @EsotericOdyssey and kenneth, he has dialogue in the game files for a BUNCH of stuff that never happens in-game
[1:31:35] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @EsotericOdyssey So there was in fact too much content for this game lol
[1:31:39] <zenith0111> @esotericodyssey Or are we supposed to do something with the ashes before giving it to her?
[1:31:42] <%notsoy> they're all super chill about this
[1:31:46] <sirrice77> @TurtlesAndTentacles they weren't better at all. Some npcs just disappear without closure. Hell in one questline you get an ITEM referencing the end step of the quest that no longer exists but the item is still given to you
[1:31:49] <%NBUsagi> Everyone is really chill about you killing god
[1:31:49] <tri3dgE027> For a "cardinal sin", everyone talking this relatively chill
[1:31:54] <%TheAdMerlin> So the Round Table is inside the Erd Tree, like a dream
[1:31:56] <$EsotericOdyssey> @zenith0111 nobody can find anything, even datamining
[1:31:59] <klooswep> The people who live in this burning house seem very calm and matter-of-fact about all this
[1:31:59] <%Daskolin> Atleast snek girl will survive
[1:32:00] <%dekkitout> It do be like that
[1:32:01] <%mythcreant> erryone's real tired
[1:32:02] <Lulu19> this guy reminds me of a hollowknight character
[1:32:03] <%Smokay17> I wish Patches was here
[1:32:05] <+Shishi1205> @zenith0111 they are a key item, cant even use them as summons
[1:32:06] <GrenYena> Goldmask is probably popping off rn
[1:32:06] <$EsotericOdyssey> it appears to just be unfinished and left in on accident
[1:32:09] <tolloponik> I think the people that would be mad are dead now?
[1:32:14] <zenith0111> @esotericodyssey Oof dead quest chain. Shame
[1:32:18] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt so this is just a dream space located inside the erdtree which is pretty fun
[1:32:18] <+vaderxyz1970> The Cardinal sin against the 2 fingers
[1:32:39] <$EsotericOdyssey> @GrenYena doing naruto-lookin-ass hand signs
[1:32:41] <Lulu19> this place is long af
[1:32:49] <$EsotericOdyssey> while t-posing furiously
[1:32:50] <%NBUsagi> "Oh so you killed god? Well cool as long as you still become Elden Lord"
[1:32:52] <+Shishi1205> yeah
[1:32:59] <+Shishi1205> Its like the ringed city
[1:33:01] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> BIG dmc ENERGY
[1:33:02] <+Shishi1205> maybe longer
[1:33:04] <NewWillinium> Yeah you can
[1:33:06] <$sarah_galb> did pat ever get the secret area to the left of the snow area ?
[1:33:07] <%Valdorick> Yeah, this shit is done today.
[1:33:08] <%JonathLP> almost two thirds done pat!
[1:33:08] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You can honestly beat it today no problem
[1:33:08] <BigFingerRo> BUT WHAT IF YOU COULD DO IT TODAY THO PAT?
[1:33:09] <+chaggles> yup
[1:33:11] <%Felhad> You can defo do it today
[1:33:14] <$OfficerMods> you can but its gonna be a lot of bosses
[1:33:18] <%atlasdotwav> dragin
[1:33:21] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @sarah_galb Yeah, he did all of it last stream.
[1:33:23] <depressioncherrie> mimic fighting the tornado over there
[1:33:25] <%Valdorick> @sarah_galb He's even using the boss of that area's sword
[1:33:28] <+Shishi1205> oh you will see
[1:33:34] <klooswep> Here, fight a dragon
[1:33:35] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> And I mean DmC lol reboot
[1:33:36] <%Bluwizard21> has he been to haligtree?
[1:33:36] <%NBUsagi> lol just a fuck off city full of dragons XD
[1:33:38] <%AsherCaelum> Catching a lightning bolt and swinging it like a sword is the coolest goddamn thing ever.
[1:33:39] <%dekkitout> Oh dang
[1:33:41] <ExpressNode> Imagine if there were two of them
[1:33:41] <klooswep> It'll be sick
[1:33:41] <+pugszerosugar> Got to beat it so you can play it again.
[1:33:42] <oda_flobunaga> @sarah_galb even further to the left of the concecrated snowfield?
[1:33:44] <zenith0111> Nah this is the bitch dragon that ran away
[1:33:46] <NewWillinium> So . . . Do the Dragon-Greases actually add a lot of damage to fighting dragons?
[1:33:53] <tri3dgE027> Practically a Castlevania / Megaman Boss Rush dungeon LuL
[1:33:58] <%Nekros4442> the lightning dragoms are def my favourite variant
[1:33:59] <kingmemelord97> @Shishi1205 oh is this where the fun begins ?
[1:34:06] <$sarah_galb> @oda_flobunaga it goes to the underground bloodzone
[1:34:15] <%Daskolin> :)
[1:34:16] <+Shishi1205> the same happened when the crucible knights are just an enemy that only drops 7k runes
[1:34:20] <+Shishi1205> And nothing else
[1:34:20] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Bluwizard21 He did all of the Haligtree yesterday
[1:34:22] <sirrice77> So did pat not find the roundtable in the capital? It's almost exactly the same.
[1:34:23] <$KnightAsteran> the lock on for these dragons FUCKIN SUCKS ASS
[1:34:23] <Mitchellsocks> This is the funniest place to invade, you hide in one of the siderooms and jump people with the dragon
[1:34:29] <HeroToxiko> i bet he would just haate rot
[1:34:41] <xDartuzax> These dragons look straight out of MonHun
[1:34:41] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> This is my favorite dragon
[1:34:43] <oda_flobunaga> @sarah_galb yes, both ways you can get there, killed Mogh
[1:34:47] <+Shishi1205> man playing with shield is so different
[1:34:52] <fishmonger555> Has Pat done the Lord of Blood section yet?
[1:34:55] <+Shishi1205> I noly used shield vs rykard
[1:34:57] <$KnightAsteran> @herotoxiko it's how I killed him
[1:34:57] <HeroToxiko> YO IT'S HIM
[1:34:58] <+Shishi1205> only
[1:34:59] <LMTTN> the lockon camera looks so painful here
[1:35:00] <%AsherCaelum> Elden Ring probably has the best dragons in all of FromSoft's games
[1:35:04] <Lulu19> he did
[1:35:07] <NewWillinium> @fishmonger555 Ye
[1:35:08] <sirrice77> @fishmonger555 he did
[1:35:10] <oda_flobunaga> Mogh is Dead
[1:35:14] <HeroToxiko> Trailer dragon
[1:35:18] <zanzibarian_hamster> Legitimately just an elder dragon from monster hunter frontier or something
[1:35:23] <NewWillinium> He has done everything But Faram  Azula and the next section
[1:35:28] <Mitchellsocks> are both Mohgs dead?
[1:35:31] <%AsherCaelum> Mohg is dead and we get to leave tiny fucked up child Miquella alone until...probably the DLC?
[1:35:34] <fishmonger555> dang, time to scan vods lol. thank you
[1:35:35] <NewWillinium> Ye
[1:35:37] <MaritimeSpanker> yes
[1:35:45] <+vaderxyz1970> I can only imagine the mimic is screaming in rage and agony but we can't hear it so Pat goes It's great!
[1:35:48] <Lulu19> i dont think he'll get dung eaters rune
[1:35:51] <+Shishi1205> @AsherCaelum tiny? have you seen his hand?
[1:36:06] <eleskei> angel dragon
[1:36:08] <MaritimeSpanker> @Lulu19 he killed dungeater, so no
[1:36:09] <sirrice77> @Lulu19 he wont because he killed dung eater instead of doing questline
[1:36:10] <Lulu19> rip
[1:36:14] <$realm_forge> That tornado in the background is the perfect metaphor for my anxiety
[1:36:14] <MaritimeSpanker> no rune there
[1:36:15] <Mitchellsocks> BIIIIG baby Mioquella
[1:36:18] <Lulu19> oh lol
[1:36:21] <%robotoken> slayed the dragussy
[1:36:21] <%anoldtoilet> getting a slab for that makes sense
[1:36:22] <HeroToxiko> in elden ring the dragons hit YOU with lightning spear
[1:36:23] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt by the way pat the final secret boss of the game is in this zone and From pulled a dick move with it as it's literally behind the final grace in the zone
[1:36:24] <%NBUsagi> lol im just waiting on another one to fly in
[1:36:27] <%AsherCaelum> @AsherCaelum Well, he WAS tiny.  Looks like Mohg might have actually broken his curse of eternal childhood?
[1:36:27] <@Fuggins4U> that was a cool dragon
[1:36:38] <+Shishi1205> chat did you find the secret boss of this area
[1:36:39] <Frostydough1> anyone gonna tell him he respawns
[1:36:44] <djblue_shift> watch it come back
[1:36:50] <rosabellamelantha> I did
[1:36:51] <%Kevlar_Caviar> dragon DEEEEEEZ nuts
[1:36:51] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Shit did I miss haligtree?
[1:36:52] <+Shishi1205> bc I found it while looking after something else
[1:36:53] <NewWillinium> I think Miqella was growing in his little caccoon yeah. And then Mohg ripped him out of it
[1:36:55] <rosabellamelantha> by luck
[1:37:00] <%anoldtoilet> LOL
[1:37:02] <+Mrbaconator> just you wait
[1:37:05] <%EldritchBee> @Bluwizard21 Haligtree was last night
[1:37:05] <%Valdorick> First time drops don't mean no respawn Kappa
[1:37:06] <rosabellamelantha> that secret boss is in the MOST DICKISH location
[1:37:07] <%anoldtoilet> Hey, after you kill that dragon, want some grease?
[1:37:09] <doster504> @Shishi1205 yea I missed half of the area first time through lol
[1:37:09] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I mean he came back to fight you  lol
[1:37:14] <sirrice77> @AsherCaelum I don't think mohg did it. Miquella put himself in his cocoon to do that. Mohg just stole the cocoon
[1:37:15] <+Shishi1205> @rosabellamelantha its a crime its that easy to miss
[1:37:17] <%NBUsagi> @NewWillinium Nah Mohg stole the cacooon and was trying to coax him out of it
[1:37:20] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> At +25 the Brass Shield has 69 guard boost
[1:37:23] <%notsoy> MEGA MAN BOSS RUSH
[1:37:29] <+vaderxyz1970> @newwillinium And then Mohg tried to marry him
[1:37:31] <Lulu19> the worst enemy here are the birds tbh
[1:37:33] <+RedMaskBandit> do u not like capes?
[1:37:37] <Paperware> It's a pretty big ass dungeon
[1:37:39] <NewWillinium> @NewWillinium Right but he ripped the Caccoon out of the Haligtree roots no?
[1:37:43] <$EsotericOdyssey> @AsherCaelum i think the problem is mohg stole the coocoon before miquella was done cooking, as it were
[1:37:43] <%AsherCaelum> I think the lore implication is that Miquella, when he was serving as the core of the Haligtree, was finally able to grow.  He kept growing even after the cocoon was separated
[1:37:44] <cavefishes> We love Crumbling Farum Azula
[1:37:45] <%Deft_Thought> Pat's a filthy dex user now?
[1:37:48] <+AyupaPupa> stealth
[1:37:49] <+Shishi1205> @Lulu19 instakill boys tho
[1:37:52] <%Deft_Thought> Who'da thunk it
[1:37:52] <oda_flobunaga> The Secret boss of this area broke for me and I got a free kill
[1:37:57] <Mitchellsocks> Can't wait for the Duo
[1:38:09] <%AsherCaelum> You can see in the intro cutscene an image of Mohg holding an unconscious Miquella, and he's child-sized.
[1:38:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> DEX IS SEX STR is STRESS
[1:38:22] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @oda_flobunaga Same thing happened to Lobos. Madman left the zone, though.
[1:38:23] <Mitchellsocks> @oda_flobunaga My "obligatory ER boss break" was Volcano Manor Godskin Noble
[1:38:25] <Varanoo> Gold Skeleton is such a great look
[1:38:40] <+Shishi1205> @AsherCaelum now that you mention it that might be miquella
[1:38:40] <@Fuggins4U> does Pat have any long range weapons equipped?
[1:38:41] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt jump out the windown in that mummy room
[1:38:44] <V0LK__> is there a dragon transformation in this game?
[1:38:45] <cavefishes> Yeah but the thing in the cocoon in his boss area is def not child sized
[1:38:50] <oda_flobunaga> Also, I'm not sure but I may have also broken the final boss
[1:38:56] <+Shishi1205> in the load screens
[1:38:59] <%Maids4lyfe> why is this place full of bloodborne?
[1:39:06] <%Dakuu75> baba-dook-dook-DOOK~!
[1:39:09] <+Shishi1205> @oda_flobunaga p1 or p2
[1:39:17] <oda_flobunaga> P2
[1:39:17] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt back where you were in the room with the mummies
[1:39:32] <+Shishi1205> @oda_flobunaga fuck him, he deserves it
[1:39:34] <rosabellamelantha> after the grace
[1:39:37] <Lulu19> this is ancient yharnam
[1:39:42] <+vaderxyz1970> @maids4lyfe Because outside God's existence in Elden Ring
[1:39:51] <$EsotericOdyssey> @Dakuu75 oh god damnit i can't unsee it now
[1:39:52] <%Maids4lyfe> oh
[1:39:56] <$EsotericOdyssey> fuck
[1:39:58] <rosabellamelantha> out the windows
[1:39:59] <%AsherCaelum> But yeah, Miquella was definitely working to basically remove the curse laid on him and his sister.  He gave her the gold needle which kept her curse (the scarlet rot) at bay, and it seems like he was working on breaking his own curse as well before Mohg happened.
[1:39:59] <+Shishi1205> time for parkours
[1:39:59] <Mitchellsocks> @oda_flobunaga we stan Chaos 5
[1:40:05] <oda_flobunaga> I either stunlocked it into oblivion with Mimic or it broke but I was riding the ass too close to see
[1:40:09] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt go out the window
[1:40:32] <%NBUsagi> NO matter what the lore though, Mogh is a creeper and slaying him at least lets poor Miquella continue growing free of his influence
[1:40:41] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Chat dont do be trippin
[1:40:44] <oda_flobunaga> But Faram Azula's Secret Boss definately broke for me
[1:40:55] <DigiDom> out the window onto the roof
[1:40:57] <%AsherCaelum> oh yeah, Mohg is a fucking creep and i'm glad he's dead
[1:41:05] <Midnight188> Mohg and his brother Also Mohg
[1:41:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> got that inside lightning
[1:41:27] <+Shishi1205> the omen "race" are strange
[1:41:30] <SQDizzy> there's only one Mohg
[1:41:31] <BigFingerRo> ahhhhh I'M CASTIIIING
[1:41:33] <Ethel9727> Mohg is just a sentient list of search terms you don't want to see
[1:41:35] <+vaderxyz1970> @nbusagi is Miquela even alive? I could interact with him after killing Mohg
[1:41:35] <Mitchellsocks> Mohg the Omen is presumably a form like Margit, a manifestation of the true one
[1:41:35] <+Shishi1205> They can use projections or sth
[1:41:45] <Lulu19> morrgot is his brother
[1:41:47] <%EldritchBee> Mohg's brother is Morgott
[1:41:50] <NewWillinium> Did Mohg kill Miqella though? Because. . .well he bled but he certainly wasn't moving
[1:41:52] <oda_flobunaga> Seriously thay should have called the other Mogh, Worf
[1:41:58] <Ghufufin> are these supposed to be kobolds?
[1:42:05] <%AsherCaelum> Omen aren't really a *race*, per se.  They're just humans born with a really fuckin weird affliction.  They're kind of like Padjali in FFXIV, where it just randomly HAPPENS to some babies.
[1:42:10] <tolloponik> who are you able to even give that to now?
[1:42:14] <%anoldtoilet> i thought miquella was in the haligtree
[1:42:16] <+Shishi1205> @oda_flobunaga I think its the same as Margrit
[1:42:18] <%cade_calrayn> @NewWillinium Miquella was already in the cocoon prior to being kidnapped, but it's unclear
[1:42:20] <%Deft_Thought> #touchgrace
[1:42:20] <+vaderxyz1970> @ghufufin Jacked Kolbolds
[1:42:25] <%anoldtoilet> @Ghufufin i think gnolls
[1:42:26] <sirrice77> @NewWillinium Nothing says he did. People just assume he did because miquella looks dead af but he might not be
[1:42:27] <+Akizea> yeah this place is mildly confusing to go through
[1:42:28] <+Shishi1205> but with no name change
[1:42:32] <Omenaire_> there is so much fucking GAME in this GAME
[1:42:32] <$EsotericOdyssey> @Ghufufin remember that one early early boss that was probably the first or second you fought? "Beastman of Farum Azula"?
[1:42:33] <sendart> game is screaming at you to level shit up
[1:42:36] <%fat_burtreynolds> So no sip?
[1:42:37] <$EsotericOdyssey> these are more of that guy
[1:42:40] <%cade_calrayn> this is a proper Legacy Dungeon
[1:42:41] <fishmonger555> was shocked to find out you can get here fairly early via a teleport
[1:42:41] <%fat_burtreynolds> Ok grace
[1:42:43] <Gray_LoFi> Oh they just give that to you, huh
[1:42:45] <Mitchellsocks> @anoldtoilet Miquella was ripped from the Haligtree by Mohg, that's why all that's left is a tear at the base of the humanoid tree biot
[1:43:03] <Mitchellsocks> @fishmonger555 only a small preview section
[1:43:06] <+Shishi1205> @Ghufufin there's a duo in a cave in caleid that are just literally two enemies form this zone
[1:43:11] <%anoldtoilet> the tree itself is shaped like miquella in the malenia cutscene tho, like he became part of it
[1:43:12] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @NewWillinium Ofnir literally says that he is alive if you talk to him
[1:43:13] <oda_flobunaga> @Shishi1205 I figure so as well, but calling him Worf would have been funny .
[1:43:24] <+Shishi1205> @oda_flobunaga yeah
[1:43:30] <%anoldtoilet> i wonder if the reason "miquella" was so unresponsive and is when you see him is that he left his body behind
[1:43:31] <sirrice77> @NewWillinium Oh that's true yeah
[1:43:33] <%AsherCaelum> So here's a question: do you guys think we'll get DLC for Elden Ring?
[1:43:36] <+Akizea> right on
[1:43:37] <%AsherCaelum> I sincerely hope so.
[1:43:37] <%BinaryFireball> @patstaresat this is a very good zone to explore fully
[1:43:41] <Lulu19> mohg was enticed by an out god called the mother something to commit fuckery
[1:43:42] <depressioncherrie> Kappa it's probably nothing
[1:43:44] <NewWillinium> @NewWillinium Ofnir doesn't know everything though. Oh he makes assumptions based off of what you tell him, but he can't know for sure
[1:43:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> NotLikeThis fuck
[1:43:48] <%Pookiedaexzile> Ruh Roh
[1:43:49] <+chaggles> dont worry about it
[1:43:50] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @AsherCaelum absolutely no question
[1:43:50] <hotrax> maybe we will fight miquella as dlc?
[1:43:51] <+Shishi1205> This place is obviously based on archdragon peak
[1:43:51] <$EsotericOdyssey> THE PUZZLE COMES TOGETHER
[1:43:51] <Frostydough1> speaking of monster man have you been feeding him?
[1:43:53] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Tells what you think great detective Pat
[1:43:54] <%dekkitout> What happens if/when he eats enough
[1:43:54] <+orochiblood> mmmm im so full of death
[1:44:03] <Ghufufin> thank you chat i know the game calls them beastman, but some legends describe kobolds as having canine features and these guys worship dragons
[1:44:09] <DigiDom> dont think about it too much
[1:44:15] <+vaderxyz1970> If he eats death does that mean. he shits life?
[1:44:15] <%Kevlar_Caviar> <-- so full of death
[1:44:30] <%anoldtoilet> is that like a slab for spirit ashes
[1:44:30] <NewWillinium> Are the Beastmen a seperate people from the Demi-Humans?
[1:44:34] <%anoldtoilet> i havent seen one yet
[1:44:40] <+Shishi1205> maybe
[1:44:41] <$EsotericOdyssey> @NewWillinium yes
[1:44:43] <+Shishi1205> seems like it
[1:44:45] <%Valdorick> Dark Souls has "Its Lit Fam", and this one will have "Touch Grace"
[1:44:52] <%atlasdotwav> this place is based on that Mario Odessy level i think
[1:44:52] <+vivivielle> i had so many of those gloveworts by the end of the game but never used them since mimic was the only one i needed lmao
[1:44:56] <%anoldtoilet> yes @NewWillinium afaik the demi-humans, misbegotten, and gnolls are all different
[1:44:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> @NewWillinium demi-humans seem less gross
[1:45:00] <%Valdorick> Oh yeah, look toward the Tree!
[1:45:01] <%anoldtoilet> and maybe there are more beastmen lol
[1:45:04] <%Dew217> Is Pat at the End?
[1:45:16] <%Deft_Thought> Turtle man ain't worried about the tree burning?
[1:45:16] <+vaderxyz1970> Turtle Pope is the most chill Pope
[1:45:18] <%AsherCaelum> Hot take: Mimic needs to get a nerf, just so there's a reason to use the LOADS of other summon ashes.
[1:45:21] <NewWillinium> @Dew217 The Penultimate area
[1:45:22] <%Maids4lyfe> dog
[1:45:22] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Tutel Pope is best Pope
[1:45:24] <+Shishi1205> dragon lightning
[1:45:24] <%AsherCaelum> ...Okay, Tiche is also worth using, but still.
[1:45:27] <hotrax> @Dew217  lol no
[1:45:30] <%Valdorick> *fucking fog*
[1:45:30] <%BinaryFireball> honestly people say INT is op but I think faith has the better spells by far
[1:45:31] <bassoontyphoon> Hi Pope Polnareff
[1:45:31] <VeryTricky> so this game runs well on ps5?
[1:45:32] <$KnightAsteran> I love turtle pope
[1:45:32] <+Shishi1205> lol
[1:45:35] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> You have to be end game? Really?
[1:45:36] <%Felhad> its almost like Elden went extremely hard on Faith for some reason
[1:45:37] <Mitchellsocks> Dog
[1:45:37] <%SveriSageAdvice> its uh... a bit foggy lol
[1:45:38] <%mythcreant> SMOG TIME
[1:45:39] <zenith0111> Thanks :)
[1:45:46] <$EsotericOdyssey> look toward the tree somewhere with better weather
[1:45:46] <%AsherCaelum> @VeryTricky EHHH.
[1:45:47] <%dekkitout> Air quality lookin like LA
[1:45:47] <Halfsock> try finger, but tree
[1:45:50] <NewWillinium> Faith absolutely has the better variation of spells
[1:45:51] <%Maids4lyfe> @VeryTricky it runs perfect on ps5
[1:45:57] <%NBUsagi> Tree burn
[1:45:58] <+Shishi1205> yee
[1:46:00] <Ghufufin> @AsherCaelum i would argue that other summons just need to be more buffable so you can use them in NG+ too
[1:46:00] <zanzibarian_hamster> turtle pope affable about the tree burning
[1:46:02] <%AsherCaelum> It cannot run at a locked 60 ever.  PS5 version fluctuates between 45-55 on average.
[1:46:04] <tri3dgE027> Everyone having a whiff of the GOOD STUFF FeelsGoodMan
[1:46:06] <%Willowight> pretty
[1:46:08] <$EsotericOdyssey> MOON TIME MOON TIME
[1:46:10] <%Maids4lyfe> I love the moon
[1:46:12] <VeryTricky> my pc frames still suffer
[1:46:13] <rosabellamelantha> Ranni time now
[1:46:14] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt have you spoken with doll ranni in her alcove?
[1:46:16] <Chaos_Aether> Endwalker?
[1:46:16] <NewWillinium> Oh that's Lightning Stake but better
[1:46:21] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt who's your favorite Outer God
[1:46:21] <@QueequegTheater> What I miss so far
[1:46:21] <%bundle_of_herbs> read the spells?
[1:46:23] <%justcallmebobplease> Can't you chain it, and cast twice?  The stab-in-ground one?
[1:46:25] <$EsotericOdyssey> in Elden Ring
[1:46:25] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> THUNDER
[1:46:29] <Midnight188> we're doing the Age of Stars ending right? I know he did Ranni's questline.
[1:46:34] <%Dew217> That is a very nice blood lighting
[1:46:38] <%dekkitout> How are those better seeming than the others from that black dragon boss?
[1:46:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> But does it have the Rocks DPS g
[1:46:42] <rosabellamelantha> yep age of stars
[1:46:43] <NewWillinium> @QueequegTheater Beat Fire Giant. Beat first dragon at Faram Azula
[1:46:44] <%Mister_McDerp> are we gonna replace tree with the moon presence?
[1:46:50] <%bundle_of_herbs> boo
[1:47:10] <megaman_sentinel> what about the elevator
[1:47:11] <Ghufufin> till a new cool Fatih weapon drops
[1:47:15] <+Shishi1205> I mean you can get a 28 stat boost so with just a bit it works
[1:47:15] <Lulu19> end game dudes are holy so faith kinda sucks
[1:47:15] <%Rbeatononefour> oh god stake of marike
[1:47:16] <@QueequegTheater> curses
[1:47:19] <jacksawjack> @zanzibarian_hamster He's probably chill with it.  Heresy is but a contrivance after all
[1:47:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> Gave up the Lord for the Sword
[1:47:25] <+Shishi1205> For farming I go from 15 faith to 43
[1:47:27] <$EsotericOdyssey> @Mister_McDerp iirc the Dark Moon is an Outer God that can replace the Greater Will
[1:47:28] <rosabellamelantha> @Mister_McDerp Nah Ranni was very clear that we're not having any of that shit on earth cus the gods keep fucking up
[1:47:29] <$EsotericOdyssey> so, yeah
[1:47:34] <SQDizzy> there's a really cool faith-dex greatsword
[1:47:45] <ape_hawk> did pat ever do that minidungeon he marked before fighting the fire giant?
[1:47:52] <%Dew217> Hey Pat is Canada able to try Luna?
[1:47:53] <Ethel9727> Also, you can see Farum Azula from the isolated Divine Tower
[1:47:55] <%AsherCaelum> I hope any DLC we get expands more on Elden Ring's cosmology.  I wanna learn more about the Formless Mother and the other outer gods
[1:48:00] <+crimsonomen0> Fell asleep during stream last night, pat beat Melania?
[1:48:04] <+FlappySeal_> nice one pat, you destroyed the pretty skybox
[1:48:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> was that the kiln up there too?
[1:48:10] <+Shishi1205> chat has Pat spoken with doll ranni in her alcove? it sounds like he did but Im not sure
[1:48:12] <$EsotericOdyssey> @crimsonomen0 yuh
[1:48:15] <sirrice77> @crimsonomen0 he did, using her weapon rn
[1:48:16] <+Shishi1205> And its a cool tidbit

[1:48:25] <%Kevlar_Caviar> oh he spittin!!!
[1:48:26] <%Valdorick> Do you want the hint on how to fight an extra boss in here?
[1:48:27] <Lulu19> i like how this game and world aren't as dire as DS or BB. Some ends are actually hopeful.
[1:48:28] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Time for the area that turned my opinion around on Wormfaces. These guys make me feel sad.
[1:48:33] <%furiousfurioso> yo fuck this specific spot
[1:48:36] <%CryoByjorne> zangief sounding enemies
[1:48:37] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> This feels like progression

[1:48:42] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt That's probably nothing
[1:48:42] <+crimsonomen0> cool.
[1:48:43] <GrenYena> That looks like a boss arena
[1:48:48] <+FlappySeal_> Totally not an arena lmao
[1:48:49] <zenith0111> @ashercaelum One item in game does imply the Mages found space travel
[1:48:51] <+Shishi1205> round 3 baby
[1:48:54] <%AsherCaelum> wow look at this FFXIV boss arena

[1:50:43] <%Bluwizard21> not 35 minutes but they think they can reach it
[1:50:45] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> There is no way you beat this game in 35vminutes
[1:50:47] <djblue_shift> those wrong warps are wild
[1:50:48] <bassoontyphoon> @bluwizard21 jfc really? That’s bonkers

[1:50:58] <%AsherCaelum> that's the secret
[1:50:58] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt most of that 35 minutes is in this area
[1:50:58] <%BinaryFireball> 10min run gonna happen I bet
[1:51:00] <$sassyquatch963> @Midnight188 @NewWillinium thanks lads
[1:51:04] <Ethel9727> They found a wrong warp. They basically just get the weapon, upgrade it, then go to Farum Azula
[1:51:06] <NewWillinium> I'm really just waiting to see what a non-glitch speedrun of the game will be
[1:51:07] <BYAKURENLOVER763> hello everyone i beat the game a couple of hours ago and im still feeling the immesurable high

[1:54:28] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt super "fun" fact, you have met the basilisks of this game right?. When they get the glowing eyes thingy the small ones are the glowy ones confirming what we thought b4
[1:54:29] <Omenaire_> how soon after will be your second playthrough?
[1:54:33] <Blank9> it is too much game and too unbalanced
[1:54:40] <$bravebravesrobin> that's what a quitter would say @patstaresat
[1:54:41] <+RayDaug> Games long and game's tough, it's draining to play. 80 hours since release took it out of me
[1:54:41] <%fat_burtreynolds> More tongue but hole
[1:54:42] <DigiDom> i finished last night but i keep thinking about starting another run

[1:54:49] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Will you ever stream it again?
[1:54:55] <%dmbender> Im really excited to see what bullshit luck Reggie has when he plays
[1:54:59] <+aaymon86> It's like eating an entire cheesecake. It starts off great, but by the end you just want it to end.
[1:54:59] <%TheLemuroid> You've been going hard on it for the past couple weeks. It makes sense to be exhausted.
[1:55:01] <%Valdorick> Yes

[1:55:49] <+Shishi1205> Not as wild as Sajam tho
[1:55:51] <WeebFever> DLC land where you can upgrade your weapons to +40
[1:55:51] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> How do you even mod a game this big?
[1:55:53] <Scuura> I just want Arcane scaling to be fixed.
[1:55:57] <DuckAlfred> oh god they're crying
[1:56:02] <Ethel9727> I can't wait for DLC that's just a whole new soulsborne game
[1:56:03] <%Kevlar_Caviar> LUL
[1:56:05] <%fat_burtreynolds> Macho Man Update incoming
[1:56:05] <senfood> Pat, those are blue.
[1:56:07] <$OfficerMods> halo guns
[1:56:07] <$sarah_galb> at this point in the game i just ran past most enemies
[1:56:09] <+heiro001> they'll patch arcane eventually
[1:56:10] <+Shishi1205> there are already mods
[1:56:13] <depressioncherrie> I mean, people are modding Skyrim
[1:56:13] <BYAKURENLOVER763> with reckless abandon!
[1:56:16] <%dekkitout> With a SHIT TON of documentation
[1:56:18] <%TheAdMerlin> With a hammer is the common term
[1:56:18] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> i go for everything because im colorblind
[1:56:18] <%Pookiedaexzile> Add in Flight
[1:56:18] <heiro001> hey guess what has a lot of mods? Skyrim
[1:56:20] <NewWillinium> People will try to mod this game into being Skyrimm
[1:56:21] <Ethel9727> "Travel to the island of Bharnam and fight the...rune-borne beasts."
[1:56:22] <%VictorVonLouche> Randomizer would be SICK for this game lol.
[1:56:22] <%notsoy> i mean, people have modded skyrim and total warhammer, what do you expect
[1:56:23] <+FlappySeal_> given the anticheat, how would mods work? Genuine question. Would it not trigger shit?
[1:56:23] <$EsotericOdyssey> @NaderShahDidNothingWrong like they mod skyrim
[1:56:24] <%Brassnarwhal> with reckless abandon
[1:56:26] <Ghufufin> you pick a small section and mess it up
[1:56:27] <%soloshotfirst82> @DuckAlfred i'd cry too if my face was worms
[1:56:29] <tolloponik> has this game beat skyrim as the forever game?
[1:56:36] <%Rbeatononefour> who needs fireballs?
[1:56:44] <Omenaire_> a double jump on foot would honestly feel sick in this imo
[1:56:51] <rosabellamelantha> sorry nothing
[1:56:51] <Ghufufin> @FlappySeal_ first mod is to turn off anti cheat
[1:56:51] <%Brassnarwhal> @ethel9727 the rune starved beasts?
[1:56:53] <NewWillinium> @tolloponik Unsure. But it has beat out all the other Souls games in that way
[1:57:00] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> like what color was that idk im colorblind ill pick it up anyway
[1:57:01] <+RedMaskBandit> a lot of the Souls community has been streaming their series favorites
[1:57:02] <%Daskolin> Cannot wait for Tomas mods
[1:57:03] <+Shishi1205> I've never checked what the purple materials are for. I know about the sleep ones but thats it
[1:57:05] <rosabellamelantha> that's it
[1:57:13] <%fat_burtreynolds> No hidden wall or floor?
[1:57:18] <Ethel9727> If modders are able to build good enough tools, Elden Ring could in fact beat Skyrim as the forever game. It has the massive reach
[1:57:20] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Was Alex suppose to be here Chat? I saw someone say next zone
[1:57:20] <%fat_burtreynolds> Hidden jumó
[1:57:28] <+Shishi1205> hidden floors are on magic land
[1:57:30] <tolloponik> no free dragon heart?
[1:57:36] <%Brassnarwhal> @eye_of_the_red_giant the solution is easy, just do what i do and pick up EVERYTHING
[1:57:36] <Midnight188> waiting for the cheatengine script so i can screw around to my heart's content
[1:57:39] <kingmemelord97> the reward was the friend you made along the way
[1:57:41] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt look up here over at the distance
[1:57:42] <+RedMaskBandit> this whole series has immense replay value.

[1:58:20] <Ethel9727> Pat, you should check out the view from the Isolated Divine Tower
[1:58:22] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt there's an NPC over on that big building
[1:58:23] <%fat_burtreynolds> Bullshit psaGotcha
[1:58:26] <+leviting> the prosthetics are way more appealing than feet
[1:58:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> can you see this shit from there?
[1:58:39] <%anoldtoilet> ill be real theres a lot in this game for ppl who like feet. rennala... fia...
[1:58:42] <+FlappySeal_> Only thing I dislike about this place, is that it looks windy af, but there's no wind physics on clothing etc at all. Feels odd
[1:58:42] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> more like zombie beast men
[1:58:44] <Ner234> BONES
[1:58:44] <purple9z> yeah you can kinda see this from the kiln if I remember right
[1:58:47] <V0LK__> imagine a Myazaki + Tarantino game LUL

[1:58:53] <+vivivielle> the prosthetic legs and arm are a super nice touch, way more tasteful too anyway
[1:58:56] <%Brassnarwhal> @leviting psaMenace psaMenace
[1:58:57] <+RedMaskBandit> it's still the same tho? that's some malicious compliance.
[1:59:01] <Mitchellsocks> Ranni, Renalla, Fia, Sellen, sorta Malenia. Feet. Fia's have TEXTURED WRINKLES
[1:59:10] <Omenaire_> i love watching this build because im trying str/int
[1:59:15] <WeebFever> why did the skeleton beast man drop a human bone shard
[1:59:30] <+Shishi1205> @Omenaire_ thats what I've used
[1:59:33] <Ghufufin> i assume lazy drop tables or evolution
[1:59:34] <%fat_burtreynolds> You donet it
[1:59:46] <oda_flobunaga> So, what sort of Soulslike would Miyazaki and Tatantino create together?
[1:59:52] <+Shishi1205> higher level
[1:59:52] <Omenaire_> @Shishi1205 any cool shit youve found?
[1:59:56] <%atlasdotwav> try plump sort
[1:59:57] <deviljhojho_> they are called beast men so maybe thats from the human side
[2:00:10] <+Shishi1205> @Omenaire_ blaidd's ugs
[2:00:13] <Talinu> This place reminds me of Dragon's Dogma.
[2:00:19] <+Rofiarf> you need to be skinny sort
[2:00:22] <oda_flobunaga> Actually Miyazaki and Tarantino would make a game called DARK SOLES
[2:00:23] <+Shishi1205> mlgs
[2:00:26] <V0LK__> it would be FeetBorne and Samuel L jackson would be in it
[2:00:38] <%anoldtoilet> @oda_flobunaga lmfao.

[2:04:46] <Finchit> @Finchit yeah idk what it is but the game audio sounds bad
[2:04:57] <%fat_burtreynolds> Those snipers are clearing playing Minecraft
[2:04:58] <SQDizzy> probably because there are a lot of weapons
[2:05:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> they want you to enjoy the gumbo

[2:05:27] <+CatRidder> there is the right way, the wrong way and the pat way
[2:05:28] <+Shishi1205> also getting weapons to +24 or +9 is just rune investment anyway
[2:05:28] <BYAKURENLOVER763> we call those geese strats
[2:05:29] <NewWillinium> I may be wrong but I think I remember someone saying that you can grind slabs. Maybe?/
[2:05:31] <oda_flobunaga> PVP tactics in PVE
[2:05:33] <+twdlrr> thats the gameplay I came here for
[2:05:39] <%dadudewitdadragontattoo> Ambush? Guess I’ll die 😂
[2:05:41] <%Brassnarwhal> nobody likes being only allowed to level up 1 or 2 weapons with this many options it would just be frustrating
[2:05:45] <deviljhojho_> odd given how vibrant the rest of the game is
[2:05:45] <%luftraumm1> actual immortality would cause dumb ass behavior
[2:05:48] <TioXyco> it is a shitty place, after all Kappa
[2:05:51] <deviljhojho_> like really ibrant

[2:07:08] <DuckAlfred> Read my mind
[2:07:09] <NewWillinium> I've always been partial to "We've got Powah" from the Buu saga myself
[2:07:14] <+Shishi1205> The knights that use wind as magic are all dragon cultists
[2:07:14] <+xSiggsx> banished homies
[2:07:17] <deviljhojho_> god barricade shield is such a fantastic skill
[2:07:21] <%fat_burtreynolds> That’s the grenade launcher
[2:07:28] <+Shishi1205> the shield dudes and the spear/halberd dudes
[2:07:30] <deviljhojho_> i've seen people without barricade get decimated
[2:07:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> it makes me so mad that those guys get to have the hood AND the hair on their helmets
[2:07:31] <NewWillinium> Well Buu and Great Saiyaman saga

[2:07:34] <Ghufufin> @deviljhojho_  a biblically accurate angel
[2:07:52] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt these guys will kill you in a second and don't stagger easily so my MGS mage had SO MUCH TROUBLE here
[2:07:53] <$sassyquatch963> you can also see the ruins of this place strewn all across the map
[2:07:55] <%BinaryFireball> uh maze thing
[2:07:58] <deviljhojho_> @Ghufufin the ones without mouth yeah
[2:07:58] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> That was a dragon head
[2:07:58] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt and then all the parts fell all over the lands between
[2:08:00] <+Rofiarf> lol
[2:08:00] <cavefishes> NODDERS
[2:08:06] <TwistParabola> tch
[2:08:08] <TwistParabola> he figured it out
[2:08:10] <Ghufufin> lol
[2:08:25] <$OfficerMods> it's almost time
[2:08:29] <+Shishi1205> its strange how aliens are literally fundamental to the plot of elden ring
[2:08:55] <Ghufufin> he was their Oleg...
[2:08:56] <deviljhojho_> Elden ring loves three things: space, gold and lions
[2:08:58] <eleskei> grade A cult
[2:08:59] <oda_flobunaga> It's probably nothing
[2:09:03] <%Niney_Who> Has pat done all the Deathroot?

[2:09:13] <+10deez> Holy shit that's cool
[2:09:19] <+10deez> What's that sword?
[2:09:24] <NewWillinium> So speaking of fundamental to the plot of Elden Ring. . . What is the Golden Order? Is it just the faith of the Two-Fingers? Is it the State Religion? What is the Greater Will?
[2:09:25] <+Rofiarf> you can drop
[2:09:31] <+Shishi1205> oh yeah fire breathing horse dude is definitely a dragon cultist
[2:09:34] <%Rbeatononefour> ooh, great sunlight there
[2:09:37] <oda_flobunaga> @10deez Malenia"s
[2:09:42] <$OfficerMods> state religion
[2:09:50] <%dmbender> lmao
[2:09:51] <eleskei> byeeeeee
[2:09:53] <+Akizea> @NewWillinium greater will is what the two fingers answer to
[2:10:04] <+10deez> @oda_flobunaga It's on the wishlist now, thanks
[2:10:04] <%anoldtoilet> golden order is like the holy law of the land, greater will is a big god from outside the universe or something
[2:10:07] <+Shishi1205> The golden order is like the laws of physics
[2:10:27] <deviljhojho_> they took a left and ended up at the wrong furcon
[2:10:27] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> No Maidens?
[2:10:28] <+twdlrr> They look like horse skeletons
[2:10:28] <%luftraumm1> these horse skulls
[2:10:32] <WeebFever> oh no it's time
[2:10:33] <deviljhojho_> wrong left i mean
[2:10:34] <$OfficerMods> golden order is if the Pope actually had super powers
[2:10:35] <+Shishi1205> reuse time

[2:11:47] <17sevens> this is the possibly the worst fight in fromsoft history, only reason it's even somewhat okay is summons

[2:12:02] <%Kevlar_Caviar> IS HE GONNA DO THIS FIRST TRY
[2:12:02] <HeroToxiko> IT WAS FALSE PogBones
[2:12:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> "Duo"
[2:12:03] <rosabellamelantha> FOUR KINGS
[2:12:04] <%Kevlar_Caviar> HOW
[2:12:06] <WeebFever> haha you gotta empty the HP bar killing both doesnt work
[2:12:09] <mrcelab> ooh shit
[2:12:09] <%HiroProtagonest> Oh is four kings
[2:12:09] <r0flwaffles> damn malenias sword kinda invalidates the game
[2:12:09] <+dearghostss> riffYeti
[2:12:10] <+Shishi1205> 4 kings babty
[2:12:11] <deviljhojho_> LMAO
[2:12:13] <digaogrunge> "DUO"
[2:12:15] <deviljhojho_> OVERCONFIDENT
[2:12:15] <+Hellarussian> jeez
[2:12:16] <%Freakin_Wolfy> imagine ornstein and smough but if you kill orstein first Smough just fucking respawns him
[2:12:17] <HeroToxiko> They used mimicks
[2:12:18] <oda_flobunaga> GG
[2:12:20] <+Shishi1205> I spoke too soon
[2:12:23] <Ekaelis> O&S meet Four kings

[2:12:28] <faiz_saad> sit your ass down LUL
[2:12:28] <TwistParabola> gg
[2:12:28] <%JonathLP> DUO so you got to fight them twice
[2:12:28] <Finchit> this boss def feels like it wasnt finished or thought out imo
[2:12:29] <PunkZedB> overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
[2:12:29] <+Aokaay> """duo"""
[2:12:29] <LMTTN> you know, on second thought, I don't *have* to finish this game
[2:12:29] <+ShadowRFox> Gotta like when the boss can call a timeout
[2:12:30] <@Fuggins4U> DUO stands for DUOVER
[2:12:31] <klooswep> I think I'd be okay with this fight if they didn't respawn, but geez this is fucky
[2:12:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> why is the main healthbar not the same as their combined health?
[2:12:32] <TioXyco> overconfidenceis a slow and insidious killer
[2:12:33] <megaman_sentinel> it's a slow and insidious killer
[2:12:34] <%luftraumm1> overconfidence yada yada
[2:12:34] <%VictorVonLouche> This fight sucks lol
[2:12:34] <TwistParabola> Two Kings!!
[2:12:34] <$sassyquatch963> ornstein and smough and ornstein and smough
[2:12:35] <+Aokaay> more like quartet
[2:12:35] <Varanoo> Duo but its 4
[2:12:35] <%BinaryFireball> hesitation is defeat
[2:12:36] <NewWillinium> Now I call this one of the worst boss fights in the game, not because it's hard, but because they could have done something different and more interesting with it.
[2:12:36] <bobxmaker> try doing this with a rapier and no shield >.<
[2:12:36] <knotsundownsyndrome> yeah but did you feet them
[2:12:37] <$OfficerMods> AND THEY DON'T STOP COMING
[2:12:37] <%DeadlyPeaks> Does anyone else hear a tinge of kingdom hearts in this track?
[2:12:37] <BigFingerRo> that flabbyness will not be denied
[2:12:39] <V0LK__> godskin squad
[2:12:39] <%delilah4you> Four Kings baby lets go
[2:12:44] <mrcelab> these are og
[2:12:48] <+xSiggsx> not a good fight imo
[2:12:49] <jubejube56> It’s pretty bad
[2:12:51] <thehelminator> dogshit boss
[2:12:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> Jebaited
[2:12:53] <%Kevlar_Caviar> Jebaited
[2:12:54] <Tempmael> LUL
[2:12:56] <tanarath> Dragons were the cursed versions of the cannibals, so... maybe they want to be.biggest through cannibalism?
[2:12:56] <%Brassnarwhal> @r0flwaffles he says AS pat dies
[2:12:57] <+NeonFishFace> incredible
[2:12:58] <deviljhojho_> TRAITOR
[2:12:58] <mikesapartment> you cant use that gate
[2:12:58] <WeebFever> You can't use that boss door
[2:12:59] <klooswep> You can't go through at all
[2:12:59] <BigFingerRo> LUL
[2:12:59] <digaogrunge> lul
[2:12:59] <+Akizea> you cant go through that door anyway
[2:13:00] <eleskei> omg
[2:13:01] <+ipaintwithcolor> This fight is awful
[2:13:01] <%atlasdotwav> they sent me back 2 fortnite
[2:13:01] <HeroToxiko> They deserve to be purged from the game
[2:13:01] <TurranosOrn> That's actually the wrong door
[2:13:02] <NewWillinium> Right up there with putting signs on ladders
[2:13:02] <DigiDom> you cant get in that way
[2:13:02] <fergit_> wrong door anyway
[2:13:04] <+Rofiarf> you can't go through that one pat
[2:13:04] <Midnight188> fort, night
[2:13:05] <+Shishi1205> I first tried them by rushing the fuck out the first one who respawned
[2:13:05] <%CryoByjorne> you can't use that fog door
[2:13:05] <CptHarlok> I don't think you can enter through that side even without the sign
[2:13:10] <+Rofiarf> idk why though
[2:13:11] <%Willowight> why does it default to them
[2:13:11] <%solracc25> Same boss fight
[2:13:14] <cavefishes> That door isn’t a real door
[2:13:15] <+RedMaskBandit> it's a respawning boss fight with a shared health pool. again rated 2nd hardest by DeModecracy
[2:13:16] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> A REALLY LONG TIME AGO FEEL ME
[2:13:19] <knotsundownsyndrome> that's even dirtier
[2:13:19] <klooswep> It's the game itself trolling you, not the players
[2:13:20] <tanarath> to be the biggest beast*
[2:13:25] <%BinaryFireball> I find it charming when there are messages in front of important things
[2:13:26] <cavefishes> You gotta go thru the bottom one yeah
[2:13:28] <Ghufufin> so is it ever explained who was skinned for the godskins?
[2:13:42] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Ghufufin ...gods?
[2:13:44] <%dmbender> yo I hate these fat guys
[2:13:44] <%Brassnarwhal> @ghufufin my guess would be god
[2:13:47] <%dmbender> they're so annoying
[2:13:47] <ExpressNode> Whoa wtf took his health when he walked in?
[2:13:51] <+RedMaskBandit> r u going to put one there as well?
[2:13:52] <%atlasdotwav> @TurtlesAndTentacles THE DOPEST BOSS I EVER FOUGHT IN '94
[2:14:00] <deviljhojho_> huh
[2:14:00] <NewWillinium> @Ghufufin Someone seggested last night that they're using Rykard's shedded Snake skin but that doesn't seem right
[2:14:01] <%dmbender> @ExpressNode hit from the wall and then the mimic
[2:14:03] <%Brassnarwhal> @expressnode summoning mimic costs health
[2:14:04] <TheSphereHunter> these guys do suck
[2:14:05] <BigFingerRo> man, this game sure does love body deformities
[2:14:05] <bobxmaker> i think pat will do it quickly though, got really good weapon and a good summon
[2:14:05] <%tetraes> maybe try not standing in fire?
[2:14:08] <CptHarlok> @Ghufufin I could never figure out if it was God Skin or Gods Kin
[2:14:10] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @Ghufufin normal people
[2:14:18] <%notsoy> boy does that dance not work when you don't have boss HP or poise
[2:14:18] <oda_flobunaga> Brobably Godwyn
[2:14:22] <deviljhojho_> imagine them without mimic
[2:14:23] <%SaiyanShoto> My least liked boss so far in this game is the dumb gargoyles
[2:14:26] <%anoldtoilet> yeah
[2:14:26] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @atlasdotwav A man of culture I see
[2:14:27] <Saltedoasis> hate these peeled Ornstein and Smaug mfs
[2:14:27] <Chaos_Aether> Do you though
[2:14:28] <%anoldtoilet> that seems right
[2:14:30] <TurranosOrn> It's a shit duo boss
[2:14:31] <BigFingerRo> Godforesking
[2:14:33] <$OfficerMods> now imagine this fight but without a fully upgraded spirit or boss weapon
[2:14:35] <%anoldtoilet> godwyns skin seems probably the most likely
[2:14:35] <+Aokaay> I always throw out any boss respect when theres more than 1 enemy and just use my cheese strats
[2:14:36] <+TuskDeluxe> I would love to know the amount of godskin bossfights in the game
[2:14:37] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @CptHarlok seeing as how they are wearing skin, i think it's the former
[2:14:37] <%solracc25> too aggressive
[2:14:37] <+Shishi1205> their AI loves the flame ball, when you are doing things
[2:14:40] <%thepaintedring> thepaintedring subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! This boss kicked my ass. Hope you have better luck with it.
[2:14:45] <jacksawjack> This game's Ornstein & Smough
[2:14:48] <purple9z> it's bosses like this where you can tell ashes are intended
[2:14:50] <NewWillinium> I find the Fat one to be more irritating to fight. Infinitely so.
[2:14:54] <+leyk36> I’m pretty sure the godskins whole deal was that they were god hunters who used the power of destined death before malekith sealed it away
[2:14:55] <TheSphereHunter> The Foreskin Duo
[2:15:02] <TioXyco> no
[2:15:07] <+Shishi1205> the skinny one in the caleid tower had me fucked for so long
[2:15:08] <james_uu> There’s a place of grace closer to avoid the run through goobers
[2:15:19] <jacksawjack> Pudgey and the Penisworm
[2:15:21] <BigBruthaThunda> yeah i did not enjoy this one at all, but its not too bad if u scum around the pillars
[2:15:23] <+Shishi1205> bc I arrived early there and didnt have enough vigor/dmg
[2:15:23] <%SaiyanShoto> Ornstein and Smough is a good duo boss fight
[2:15:32] <%Brassnarwhal> @thespherehunter together they're kinda just a dick and balls if you think about it
[2:15:38] <cavefishes> Just keep whalin on ‘em when they’re dying for extra damage, and spawn camp the one spawning once they’re both dead
[2:15:39] <GoogleyGareth> huh haven't heard this part of the song before
[2:15:41] <rosabellamelantha> Greg is better than you
[2:15:43] <CptHarlok> Honestly the apostle is easier than that rat bastard noble.  I fucking HATE that sob.
[2:15:44] <%SilvaChariot0133> "No"
[2:15:46] <oda_flobunaga> Pat's gotta get his Moyhl on
[2:15:52] <+Shishi1205> Super helpful tip just like 4 kings you can damage their corpses
[2:15:55] <%dmbender> that scarlet rot dragon is so damn good in pvp
[2:15:59] <bobxmaker> this is where you either have to have god build or god strats.
[2:16:04] <NewWillinium> How much poise do you need before a light slap stops you from being able to cast?
[2:16:05] <BigFingerRo> WHAT is that hanging in front of the fatty?
[2:16:06] <PunkZedB> good job mimic
[2:16:09] <mrcelab> gg
[2:16:11] <+wizard_of_diamonds> GG
[2:16:12] <%Kevlar_Caviar> ...guys i think he might be a bit overleved
[2:16:14] <%notsoy> MIMIC KUN
[2:16:15] <eleskei> a bib?
[2:16:18] <SuperGoblinPunch> Great Enemy Circumcised
[2:16:21] <+Hellarussian> man summons are crazy busted
[2:16:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> tornado vs tornado lets go
[2:16:29] <NewWillinium> There is no such thing as overleveling in Elden Ring
[2:16:30] <oda_flobunaga> Inner Mohyl ACTIVATED
[2:16:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> beat up the wind
[2:16:33] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Smooth Greg is a great friend
[2:16:36] <+ipaintwithcolor> This fight without summons is hell
[2:16:42] <%tetraes> @Kevlar_Caviar  he fought Melania the rest of the game is easier than her lul
[2:16:42] <klooswep> @NewWillinium true
[2:16:45] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Black Flame Tornado became my main Ash of War for my Faith Twinblade build.
[2:16:46] <oda_flobunaga> Moyhl not Mohyl
[2:16:50] <BigFingerRo> that is a meaningless statement in this game
[2:16:55] <+Shishi1205> oh yeah
[2:16:56] <bobxmaker> use sleep arrows.
[2:17:05] <jubejube56> Why would they make the healthbar like 3 and 1/10th godskins
[2:17:07] <$sassyquatch963> Most bosses aren't going to be hard after you beat malenia
[2:17:07] <+Shishi1205> Like commander Neil, you need the aggro off of you
[2:17:12] <BigFingerRo> horse?
[2:17:13] <+ipaintwithcolor> 100%
[2:17:13] <doster504> the only reason I got through that fight is because I summoned a chad with dual lances that staggered the shit out of them
[2:17:14] <Ghufufin> purists will always be fools
[2:17:17] <%Niney_Who> Man I can't wait for Ymfah to make a full video on this game
[2:17:17] <%dmbender> @bobxmaker THOSE WORK ON THEM?
[2:17:18] <%Brassnarwhal> hey @patstaresat did you know that everything you do is busted and overpowered and real men only swing at sl1 with their bare hands
[2:17:24] <cavefishes> Turns out the summons are an intended game mechanic who’d have thunk
[2:17:24] <+Shishi1205> @jubejube56 bc you can kill it with 3
[2:17:26] <james_uu> Was that a 4 kings healthbar?
[2:17:26] <oda_flobunaga> Yeah, what sort of insane person doesn't summon for Radahn
[2:17:31] <cavefishes> HOW WACKY
[2:17:31] <%dekkitout> When the game has encounters that have summon interactions, it's safe to say summons are pretty intended
[2:17:33] <+Shishi1205> If you hurt the dying one hard enough
[2:17:34] <%Niney_Who> OLEG MOVe
[2:17:40] <%BinaryFireball> commander oniel solo for example
[2:17:41] <Varanoo> Oleg
[2:17:44] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I wish the less human summons seemed stronger
[2:17:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> OOOLEG OOOLEG OOOLEG
[2:17:46] <NewWillinium> So why are the Dragon Cultists working for the Grafted again?/
[2:17:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> these guys are extra banished
[2:17:59] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @Brassnarwhal Real player only throw shit at the enemies
[2:18:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oleg - he is better at the game then you but not mimic you
[2:18:15] <Ner234> That's not a word Pat
[2:18:17] <klooswep> I've never really cared much how people choose to play the game before, but now more than ever, I am super in favor of people using every available resource without shame
[2:18:17] <bobxmaker> @dmbender apparently, that's what i've read but i haven't fought them using that myself, i'm no coward
[2:18:18] <+Shishi1205> @NewWillinium Godrick loves dragons?
[2:18:24] <Sunstalker> The first one you fought was back in th limgrave hero grave
[2:18:26] <WeebFever> I don't think the banished knights aren't a unified faction, they're just dudes who are around
[2:18:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> These guys are in Stormveil too
[2:18:33] <%Brassnarwhal> @justtheguyyouneed true
[2:18:34] <%Deft_Thought> ! Path Lost !
[2:18:37] <klooswep> Speaking of Souls games in general I mean
[2:18:40] <NewWillinium> @NewWillinium You know what that's fair
[2:18:43] <%dekkitout> Gonna throw MOAR rocks
[2:18:45] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> What kind of rock Antoine
[2:18:50] <DigiDom> try hewg
[2:18:58] <cavefishes> A crack rock
[2:19:10] <digaogrunge> Pat loves the rock
[2:19:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> WHERE IS THE BELL FOR THIS SHIT
[2:19:22] <bassoontyphoon> @patstaresat do you think the game would benefit by being able to upgrade spells like weapons?
[2:19:28] <+Shishi1205> PAt press R3
[2:19:30] <narusao> time to go smoke dat rock
[2:19:32] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Are they frozen?
[2:19:34] <Parapattern> In THIS rune economy?
[2:19:34] <+Shishi1205> While using rune items
[2:19:44] <NewWillinium> @bassoontyphoon Jesus I can't imagine what would be needed to balance that
[2:19:49] <ExpressNode> Ever since the tree burned down the prices of these rocks has risen!
[2:19:55] <sirrice77> Don't you upgrade spells by just upgrading your catalyst though?
[2:19:56] <cavefishes> It costs like 480k+ for one set for regular stones and only like 98k for a set of somber ones
[2:20:04] <bobxmaker> yup
[2:20:09] <+Shishi1205> @cavefishes yeah
[2:20:09] <cavefishes> Yeah around 480k
[2:20:11] <r0flwaffles> upgrading regulars sucks
[2:20:12] <$TzarSalad> 480k...
[2:20:13] <cavefishes> For 12 of each stone
[2:20:14] <TioXyco> can't you farm the regula ones on the mines?
[2:20:15] <KatabolicRage> yeah it's easier to upgrade a unique weapon than a generic one, it's odd
[2:20:16] <Omenaire_> KILL GOD
[2:20:27] <klooswep> Geez dude you okay?
[2:20:27] <deviljhojho_> bro...
[2:20:38] <%Brassnarwhal> they gotta rebalance the smithing stones somehow this is getting outrageous
[2:20:40] <%Mantorok06> jmikeSadbungle
[2:20:40] <bobxmaker> the worst part is that regular weapons aren't all that impressive in PvE
[2:20:47] <deviljhojho_> whole place is a goner
[2:20:48] <Finchit> sadge
[2:20:54] <sweetkek> Spells already scale with your seals and staves you don't need to make spells upgradeable

[2:22:07] <oda_flobunaga> Things like the Antspur Rapier kick ass and are technically not unique
[2:22:17] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt Im pretty sure Farum azula is as long or longer than the ringed city
[2:22:24] <%Bluwizard21> Left of the grace
[2:22:25] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you missed two doors
[2:22:31] <KatabolicRage> your getting turned around man
[2:22:33] <badhaye> go back you missed the door
[2:22:36] <%CryoByjorne> directly left of the grace
[2:22:37] <DigiDom> yep
[2:22:38] <%Delenay> in grace room
[2:22:39] <%dekkitout> Two?!?
[2:22:45] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt 2 doors and three scrimbos
[2:22:50] <%Saadi90> Left of grace
[2:22:50] <rosabellamelantha> in the grace room
[2:22:50] <james_uu> Funnel
[2:22:53] <Finchit> is farum pre giants era?
[2:22:57] <blue8moon> LUL
[2:22:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> STOP STOKING THE GOBLINS
[2:23:01] <KatabolicRage> This grace GENUINELY confuses me with it's existance
[2:23:04] <KatabolicRage> why is this here?!
[2:23:11] <+Shishi1205> the weirdest grace in the game
[2:23:12] <+leyk36> Check the doors by the site of grace
[2:23:12] <%dekkitout> Why? Why is there a grace here?
[2:23:13] <WeebFever> This room seemingly has no purpose and it makes me mad
[2:23:14] <+Shishi1205> Free
[2:23:22] <%EldritchBee> It's like the Dragonslayer Armor - Grand Archives bonfires
[2:23:23] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt this is for if you got in here the other way
[2:23:26] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Lantern
[2:23:27] <+Smokebanshee> This was another way to calm down
[2:23:28] <PunkZedB> you can jump down there before you fight the boss
[2:23:29] <KatabolicRage> was there a build of the game where boss graces weren't a thing?
[2:23:30] <+SilverDevilfish> You can hug the wall and not trigger the boss to grab that grace
[2:23:31] <djblue_shift> naw other way yeah
[2:23:31] <+Smokebanshee> *fall
[2:23:33] <$Jaxnos> there's like 3 alternate routes to that boss room, yeah
[2:23:36] <LMTTN> Didn't an area in DS2 have two bonfires ten seconds apart
[2:23:36] <+ipaintwithcolor> You can take this path to the boss
[2:23:36] <+dudlerand> I also missed that door when I was here
[2:23:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> THIS is a BOSS SPEED ROOM
[2:23:37] <DigiDom> its for if you took a different route
[2:23:41] <Gelphaze> Apparently there's a cursed weapon in this game how crazy is that!
[2:23:43] <purple9z> it's to cut out the boss run if you find it I guess
[2:23:47] <cavefishes> You can sit there before the boss if you drop down the ledge
[2:23:47] <+ipaintwithcolor> And not have the knights follow you
[2:23:48] <$TzarSalad> @KatabolicRage I found that grace before the bigger room as thats a boss grace
[2:23:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> If you found it before the duo you could go through there
[2:24:07] <Finchit> @Gelphaze BatChest
[2:24:07] <%dekkitout> @LMTTN And there it is. That's why this game resonates so much with DS2 luddites
[2:24:12] <+Shishi1205> yeah its the one that needs 30 faith
[2:24:16] <oda_flobunaga> Where could this BEEEEEE?
[2:24:23] <%Pookiedaexzile> THe other type of Cursed
[2:24:24] <$TzarSalad> man the cost of that is sooo cheap
[2:24:25] <Frostydough1> MODERN DAY??
[2:24:31] <+Shishi1205> its L2
[2:24:33] <+Snazzy_Tomato> i just died at the last boss when he was 1 hit away
[2:24:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> The cursed weapon just had delophine's face on it
[2:24:56] <+Shishi1205> then you can roll and instakill people in pvp with a flame encantation
[2:24:57] <PunkZedB> it hits you and you get the death status effect
[2:24:59] <SQDizzy> the Eclipse Shotel?
[2:25:10] <+Shishi1205> @SQDizzy that things
[2:25:14] <+dudlerand> how many tries did malenia take?
[2:25:22] <deviljhojho_> fuck it
[2:25:25] <+heiro001> ouch
[2:25:27] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Where did the scond one come from?
[2:25:28] <%tetraes> the Eclipse Shotel is also bugged tf out
[2:25:28] <%dekkitout> Sure
[2:25:30] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt fun fact if you wear the deathbed attire and use the MGS you release a death aura of frost that ONLY hits allies and NPCS
[2:25:31] <%delilah4you> @dudlerand It was about an hour and a half fight
[2:25:31] <ExpressNode> Spear guy with the assist
[2:25:34] <%delilah4you> Which makes me ANGRY
[2:25:37] <NewWillinium> @dudlerand Like. . .20ish I think? Pat got her done in a single night
[2:25:39] <rosabellamelantha> yes
[2:25:42] <+Shishi1205> When you see an invader getting dot'ed run
[2:25:42] <%tetraes> will say it makes invading a heck of a lot easier
[2:25:45] <Midnight188> are there any items that are owrht it there tho
[2:25:52] <klooswep> @rosabellamelantha That's amazing
[2:26:07] <mrtanaka111> any ideas of what dlcs could be?
[2:26:19] <+Shishi1205> @rosabellamelantha its the garb
[2:26:27] <badhaye> Z Axis
[2:26:29] <NewWillinium> @mrtanaka111 Well we need to fight the Gloam Eyed Queen whoever that may be
[2:26:29] <+Shishi1205> you can use the eclipse shotle too
[2:26:39] <klooswep> @mrtanaka111 Malenia 2: The Maleniaing
[2:26:40] <+Shishi1205> and that one instakills
[2:26:55] <%Maids4lyfe> cheap shot lol
[2:26:57] <Talinu> Sorry for the dumb question I barely understood the story as I was going through it. Is Ranni the one who fucked things over?
[2:26:57] <cavefishes> Hoarfrost stomp is the any% speed run strat at the moment cause it basically requires no stats for crazy damage at +9 and you can pump health and FP
[2:26:58] <chernabogs_bane> after 80 hours i finally beat this game. what level is pat at currently?
[2:27:04] <%mornerboi> mornerboi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months! Hey Pat, cool to see you here; I love and hate this zone all at once. Probably in my top 5 for aesthetics, tho.
[2:27:04] <+Shishi1205> you can kill the summoner
[2:27:10] <$TzarSalad> which armour is that?
[2:27:26] <Sunstalker> Oh I found that greatshield near the frenzy flame a chatter was talking about. Yeah, it blocking 100% phys + 75 to 81 % of all elements and 81 guardboost at +0 is PRETTY GOOD indeed
[2:27:28] <mrtanaka111> they really inserted all of dark souls and demon souls plot on the game,only to reveal it was bloodborne all along
[2:27:29] <$sarah_galb> yeah
[2:27:29] <+eanscrale> Tree sentinel
[2:27:31] <V0LK__> is the tree sentinel set
[2:27:33] <%Kevlar_Caviar> nahhhhh Kappa
[2:27:33] <oda_flobunaga> Yes
[2:27:34] <+Smokebanshee> yeah big secret boss
[2:27:38] <%SveriSageAdvice> there is yeah
[2:27:39] <+Smokebanshee> oh yeah
[2:27:40] <cavefishes> Yes
[2:27:40] <+AyupaPupa> oh boy
[2:27:43] <$sarah_galb> yeah basically
[2:27:43] <%dmbender> wait the other legacy dungeons have secret bosses?
[2:27:44] <$sassyquatch963> correct
[2:27:45] <%Felhad> Yes and yes
[2:27:46] <WeebFever> He's not that big but he's very cool
[2:27:46] <badhaye> oh yeah NEO DEATH RAVE
[2:27:52] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt maaaaaaybe
[2:27:53] <ape_hawk> hes so big, you only fight his dick
[2:28:01] <GunEden> eh greyoll is bigger
[2:28:01] <BigBruthaThunda> secret boss bugged out for me and just stood still
[2:28:04] <+Shishi1205> he is weird to reach
[2:28:10] <NewWillinium> @Talinu That is unclear. The Black Knife Assassins were working for *someone*. Ranni wanted the Rune of Death to kill her mortal shell, she was working with Rykard somehow, Radahn stopped the stars to stop Ranni's ascension and fought his half sister Malenia to claim the Throne
[2:28:16] <%furiousfurioso> oh shit i must have missed him
[2:28:19] <+beansoup> Has pat done Haligtree yet?
[2:28:20] <%Dakuu75> "that's hot"
[2:28:25] <$sarah_galb> the boss is down there
[2:28:32] <NewWillinium> Yes Pat has done Haligtree
[2:28:34] <+Shishi1205> you might want to search for a fog door with double goblins
[2:28:35] <deviljhojho_> butterfly in the sky
[2:28:37] <%EldritchBee> @beansoup He's using Malenias sword
[2:28:41] <%NBUsagi> I still wonder why you are sent here after burning the tree?
[2:28:47] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt the boss is by that tornado
[2:28:52] <oda_flobunaga> Pat hasn't even left Limgrave yet
[2:28:53] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I remember that boss LUL
[2:28:54] <%EldritchBee> @NBUsagi To find Destined Death
[2:28:56] <%dmbender> god Barricade shield is SO good
[2:28:58] <%Deft_Thought> I wonder if you can get that sword
[2:29:00] <+Shishi1205> @NBUsagi you need to find destined death
[2:29:00] <majindusto> DAGRON
[2:29:07] <Xiangchang> I bet the secret boss is Nameless King the Second.
[2:29:11] <mrtanaka111> try jump attack
[2:29:13] <Talinu> @NewWillinium Ok. I'll just wait for some deep lore video. There are a few thing Is don't get.
[2:29:14] <cavefishes> Barricade shield shoes seem nutso
[2:29:22] <%NBUsagi> Point
[2:29:32] <NewWillinium> Oh cool you don't actually have to kill the Giants or Trolls to grab the chests. Just need to hit them once for them to stop
[2:29:32] <+Shishi1205> chat has pat missed the fog door? my brain can only retain so much elden ring
[2:29:42] <%Deft_Thought> We seek Destined Death that we may awaken Based Life
[2:29:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> The olllllld corner trick
[2:29:56] <+Shishi1205> its a goblin door
[2:29:59] <%dekkitout> You spotted one earlier, I think?
[2:30:11] <%Deft_Thought> A brain ruined with shortcuts
[2:30:17] <+Shishi1205> literally a goblin door
[2:30:19] <%Deft_Thought> It's like swiss cheese up there
[2:30:32] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[2:30:34] <NewWillinium> You spotted the one with the Tree Sentinel sitting in front of it
[2:30:38] <NewWillinium> But you couldn't reach it
[2:30:39] <cavefishes> all the legacy dungeons are proper fucked up mazes I kinda love it
[2:30:39] <oda_flobunaga> @dekkitout that's the end of the zone
[2:30:40] <%dekkitout> No, a fog door. At that colosseum looking place?
[2:30:45] <+Shishi1205> there's one in this zone but i cant remember where
[2:30:50] <jubejube56> How many shortcuts were in the sewers Pat?
[2:30:52] <klooswep> You mean the one up the long ass staircase towards the bottom?
[2:30:54] <purple9z> you can see a boss fog door on the big winding road in the middle of the map
[2:30:57] <oda_flobunaga> THAT"S THE END OF THE ZONE
[2:31:00] <cavefishes> Ez jump btw
[2:31:14] <WeebFever> these dogs have beards
[2:31:17] <mrtanaka111> good ol brass shield
[2:31:19] <Midnight188> grace lady died to send us to the wind and dragon swamp
[2:31:34] <+Shishi1205> bro the hemorraghing dogs in the snow fields are the worst
[2:31:35] <chernabogs_bane> is that melenias sword?
[2:31:40] <klooswep> Fire sale on dragon stones, everything must go
[2:31:46] <+Shishi1205> HEY
[2:31:50] <+heiro001> yeah that's the sword
[2:31:50] <+Shishi1205> THERE it is
[2:31:51] <mrtanaka111> kill gods, die to dogs
[2:31:58] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt I had like 12 of those by the time I beat the game, they REALLY want you to experiment with weapons
[2:31:59] <cavefishes> Game sayin hey bro your shit upgraded yet IT SHOULD BE
[2:32:02] <Chaos_Aether> You rang
[2:32:04] <%Rbeatononefour> no time to warn his bro
[2:32:20] <+Shishi1205> I have like 23 stone swords to spare btw
[2:32:22] <+heiro001> damn
[2:32:22] <ExpressNode> Well dog is god backwards
[2:32:22] <%livi242> they give you so many stonesword keys
[2:32:34] <+Shishi1205> And like 4 golden seeds after getting max flasks
[2:32:34] <%watts121> Did Pat switch to a Weeb Dex build?
[2:32:49] <%mornerboi> oh it does look a lot like the kiln
[2:32:52] <%Monkeyweed21> im pretty sure you get like 10 to 15 more stonesword keys than you need
[2:32:55] <%mornerboi> or rather, gives the same vibe.
[2:32:55] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt this is archdragon peak 2.0
[2:33:05] <DigiDom> nice
[2:33:06] <+Shishi1205> @Monkeyweed21 I have 23
[2:33:07] <%Monkeyweed21> GET OUTTA THE KILN
[2:33:16] <eleskei> ooh
[2:33:23] <sundizzle> idk if you traveled behind and below the bestial sanctum, but the architecture is the same as faram azula
[2:33:26] <Midnight188> archballmer dragonpeak
[2:33:26] <socratitties00> Hey chat maybe not the best place to ask but does the game still have the massive pc performance issues? or is more or less fixed now
[2:33:29] <cavefishes> You can land that shortcut pillar from up top too
[2:33:47] <sundizzle> socratitties00 it is not fixed
[2:33:51] <+Shishi1205> @socratitties00 depends on your machine
[2:34:01] <NewWillinium> The drop beside Beast Sanctum had me thinking it was for nothing until I got to the very bottom of it
[2:34:04] <+Shishi1205> but it tanks for everyone
[2:34:05] <$realm_forge> Yup true to brand I still want to make every new weapon I see in this game
[2:34:06] <thebestesttrashpanda> @socratitties00 Its gotten a bit better, but not by much and for a lot of people not at all
[2:34:06] <socratitties00> @sundizzle ah shit man thanks
[2:34:10] <+Shishi1205> at one point or another
[2:34:21] <%mornerboi> juked by gravity
[2:34:25] <socratitties00> okay ill probably stay clear for now thanks guys1
[2:34:26] <jmft2000> What does your Big rune do?
[2:34:30] <ape_hawk> why is pat talking like a criminal?
[2:34:30] <%watts121> @socratitties00 I have a 6700XT and it chugs.
[2:34:32] <@Fuggins4U> you sound llke Michael Caine impersonating JFK
[2:34:33] <+Shishi1205> Its optional progress
[2:34:37] <+Shishi1205> And you want it
[2:34:39] <cavefishes> The PC problem is a DX12 shader cache issue and is not fixed. It will improve as you play and build the shader cache, but loading new effects and assets will cause frame drops at first
[2:34:46] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt this is optional cool shit
[2:34:59] <+Shishi1205> I ignored everyenemy here
[2:35:02] <%Kevlar_Caviar> BEAST SKELETON
[2:35:07] <+heiro001> skeleton beastmen...
[2:35:10] <%EldritchBee> Hang a right for Quest Stuff
[2:35:20] <DigiDom> ignored them too
[2:35:24] <+Shishi1205> youy can
[2:35:36] <%JoshManVGH> I think it was Rooster Teeth that taught me "you can perfectly say Razor Blades in an Australian accent, if you say "Rise Up Lights" in even a bad Australian accent"
[2:35:42] <cavefishes> The skelebeasts are annoying to fight yeah
[2:35:57] <@Fuggins4U> hot
[2:36:00] <+Shishi1205> sprint pass them
[2:36:08] <%mornerboi> holy god frick what was THAT
[2:36:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @JoshManVGH ....that is hilarious
[2:36:12] <%JoshManVGH> Rot be damned I guess
[2:36:13] <+Shishi1205> big boy has so much poise
[2:36:18] <mrtanaka111> nothing personel kid
[2:36:20] <+tylerdurden4220> Pat what level are you sir?
[2:36:23] <Frostydough1> its a skeleton WHERE DOES THE FIRE COME FROM
[2:36:37] <+Shishi1205> @Frostydough1 they summon it
[2:36:38] <ShadeTheNovice> @JoshManVGH what kind of sorcery is this
[2:36:47] <$realm_forge> Sick smokin style
[2:36:50] <+Shishi1205> yep
[2:36:51] <%watts121> man the Elden Ring wiki has been chugging today...I'm trying to find Smithing Stones on my NG build without advancing the story.
[2:36:55] <+Shishi1205> another golden seed
[2:36:57] <%dekkitout> Boneless skeletons
[2:36:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Frostydough1 the hate of non skeletons
[2:37:05] <jacksawjack> Cumfireballs
[2:37:05] <%Monkeyweed21> Skeleton on Skeleton violence
[2:37:09] <Nordguy> "Human Bone Shard"
[2:37:14] <cavefishes> Gold Skeleton vs Beast Skeleton
[2:37:38] <%mornerboi> i like Evil Sorcery: Spooby Skull
[2:37:39] <%watts121> seeing there skeletons makes me realize the "Beast Men" are just rat people.
[2:37:42] <+ScrapKingKeita> Gold Skeleton!
[2:37:54] <+heiro001> there can be only one (skeleton)!
[2:37:56] <knotsundownsyndrome> what is that armor anyway, looks great
[2:37:58] <BigBruthaThunda> the skeleton that never gave up
[2:37:58] <%NBUsagi> I mean your clearly superior, your golden
[2:38:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat has become paige fetish
[2:38:02] <knotsundownsyndrome> i recognize the helmet, not the rest
[2:38:07] <%abakkus> pat runs up to the skeletons, asks, "no drip?" and they die immediately
[2:38:11] <+tylerdurden4220> Don’t give up (skeleton)!
[2:38:12] <yyyyfdugyu> skeletor on his quest to become elden lord
[2:38:14] <NewWillinium> @knotsundownsyndrome Tree Sentinel with the cape altered off
[2:38:17] <knotsundownsyndrome> is that tree sentinel armor?
[2:38:21] <+ArmoredAnathema> "Whoa there is stuff down there"-Elden Ring
[2:38:22] <james_uu> The best skeletons are ironically the ones inside of stuff
[2:38:23] <+muetank> Did pat not get the holy blade spell? it makes the skeletons super easy
[2:38:23] <knotsundownsyndrome> that explains it
[2:38:24] <+Shishi1205> @knotsundownsyndrome bc you need to kill chariots for the set
[2:38:33] <+edgeroth> how did pat do on malenia
[2:38:37] <jacksawjack> The Corpse Emperor
[2:38:39] <+Shishi1205> round 4
[2:38:40] <cavefishes> There’s ALWAYS stuff down there in this game
[2:38:54] <+heiro001> not again!
[2:38:57] <mrtanaka111> uh ho,ithink thats a hint
[2:39:14] <+Shishi1205> its strange
[2:39:14] <oda_flobunaga> Yeah'
[2:39:18] <%JoshManVGH> That's gotta be a bug, right?
[2:39:26] <%mornerboi> Huge agree, I find it easier to just not lock on at all on these ones.
[2:39:27] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt I don't think that guy drops anything btw
[2:39:29] <Ghufufin> real xenojiva flashbacks with the slightly too tall limbs
[2:39:30] <DigiDom> seems like they forgot
[2:39:35] <%mornerboi> And just manually beat their legs.
[2:39:36] <+Shishi1205> nah different dragon scales
[2:39:39] <DigiDom> might patch it in later
[2:39:45] <%Monkeyweed21> I find their heads easier to hit than the usual dargons
[2:39:53] <+Shishi1205> 3 of those fuckers dont give you anything
[2:39:55] <Slumpneko> frankh1Dont frankh1Dont frankh1Dont frankh1Dont frankh1Dont frankh1Dont
[2:39:56] <deviljhojho_> "im not gonna bother" is a legit strategy
[2:40:04] <+edgeroth> are there multiple of these dragons in this area or is this just one dragon moving around the area?
[2:40:12] <Midnight188> was there a tiny erdtree back there with a seed?
[2:40:20] <DigiDom> its probably nothing
[2:40:32] <+Shishi1205> yeah I had 4 to spare
[2:40:35] <%EldritchBee> POT BOYYYY
[2:40:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> jojo....golden see
[2:40:42] <chernabogs_bane> i was so confused having extra seeds. i think i had 7 extra?
[2:40:47] <rosabellamelantha> keep going
[2:40:49] <+Shishi1205> The end of his quest
[2:40:52] <+MarkoTolstov> Just so that you don’t have to explore EVERY single area in this map, I bet.
[2:40:58] <mrtanaka111> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[2:41:00] <+beansoup> They keep giving you them in NG+ too it’s weird
[2:41:04] <%watts121> time for the best talisman in the game
[2:41:05] <1dennis> noo
[2:41:06] <%JonathLP> Pobro
[2:41:06] <ergulor> Bro
[2:41:11] <blue8moon> I like you get extra, means you're not screwed over for not choosing it at the start

[2:44:07] <mrtanaka111> red haired
[2:44:08] <mrtanaka111> uh
[2:44:08] <%anoldtoilet> a red haired champion huh
[2:44:10] <$sassyquatch963> he ate radahn
[2:44:11] <chernabogs_bane> i use this with hoarfrost stomp. wrecks everything
[2:44:13] <%NBUsagi> wait a minute, Alexander had red hair?
[2:44:13] <+Shishi1205> this has 0 sense
[2:44:14] <%Valdorick> +Skill damage!? FOR REAL!?
[2:44:14] <TwistParabola> Radahn
[2:44:16] <%Kevlar_Caviar> DID HE SHOVE RADAHN IN HIMSELF
[2:44:16] <%tetraes> Did he eat Radahn?
[2:44:20] <%JonathLP> who's got red hair
[2:44:23] <mrtanaka111> or radagon
[2:44:25] <crifff> Radahn vore
[2:44:26] <%anoldtoilet> radahn isnt the only person with red hair

[2:44:29] <deviljhojho_> well
[2:44:29] <%JoshManVGH> That uh.... hmm
[2:44:30] <%dekkitout> He was sifting through the ashes back at the arena
[2:44:30] <rosabellamelantha> He shoved Radahn in himself yeah
[2:44:31] <tentavision> ginger civilwar
[2:44:31] <+Shishi1205> why would he give you the same talisman but different tiers
[2:44:34] <turtlebits64> I dunno if his comment about "join me inside" was smack talk or what but yeah that was weird
[2:44:35] <%anoldtoilet> it basically suggests alexander is royalty
[2:44:38] <%anoldtoilet> did he?
[2:44:40] <oda_flobunaga> Definately not Radagon
[2:44:40] <deviljhojho_> I GET KNOCKED DOWN
[2:44:43] <RyuuAoi> @jonathlp Pat's got short shorts!
[2:44:44] <deviljhojho_> BUT I GET UP AGAIN
[2:44:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah we saw him stuffing some Radahn in him
[2:44:48] <deviljhojho_> Wait wrong song
[2:44:50] <%Freakin_Wolfy> All giants have red hair. Does that mean that the big pots are from giants?
[2:44:53] <sirrice77> @Shishi1205 One you can get if you kill him early
[2:44:54] <BigBruthaThunda> he was eating those corpses, why not eat the best one
[2:44:54] <%EldritchBee> @anoldtoilet No, he stuffed Radhan and others inside him
[2:44:55] <+Shishi1205> yeah he was eating
[2:45:00] <1dennis> @Shishi1205 u get the first one if u just kill him normally u get the second one if u finish his questline
[2:45:01] <%anoldtoilet> @deviljhojho_ cool
[2:45:04] <$sassyquatch963> but he did say he would absorb the warrior corpses' in radahn's battle arena, atleast in my playthrough
[2:45:04] <%watts121> @Shishi1205 I believe the weaker talisman is what you get if you don't do his quest.
[2:45:07] <+Shishi1205> @Shishi1205 Ok that makes more sense
[2:45:10] <%JoshManVGH> Why is this society in love with devouring people!
[2:45:14] <deviljhojho_> @anoldtoilet PoroSad
[2:45:25] <+Shishi1205> I do know his nephew is cut content
[2:45:33] <oda_flobunaga> Vorepocalypse

[2:45:48] <%Atomik456> @JoshManVGH cause it makes you powerful. guarantee our society would be super fucked up and cannibalistic if we got powers from it
[2:45:53] <oda_flobunaga> Eh
[2:45:54] <+PARARScs> u can drop for an item
[2:45:57] <%BinaryFireball> it loops around to a previous grace now
[2:46:00] <+Shishi1205> a couple of items and drops
[2:46:02] <$sassyquatch963> nah it just loops back to a the start
[2:46:03] <rosabellamelantha> Nah

[2:46:24] <oda_flobunaga> So forgeddaboudit then
[2:46:25] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt so the followup to that was meant to be you giving his innards to one of his brothers in jarburg who wanted to be like him but the flag for that NPC is just missing for no reason
[2:46:28] <%JoshManVGH> @atomik456 I can't argue with that, and that kinda terrifies me

[2:47:02] <%Willowight> wasnt there a ledge
[2:47:09] <anuchallengertwitch> curious, but can you play as a non human in this game?
[2:47:18] <+Shishi1205> @BinaryFireball withou tips that one is imposible
[2:47:22] <%EldritchBee> @anuchallengertwitch No
[2:47:27] <+Mcardy93> Everything above the lift is optional
[2:47:29] <Vyskus> There's a secret boss here??
[2:47:31] <rosabellamelantha> Altar
[2:47:32] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt we may need to help you find the secret one.  Getting there is Fuck
[2:47:33] <+MarkoTolstov> I gave up completely on trying to explore this area. It looks cool but it’s just a pain to try and navigate every path.
[2:47:36] <+TzarSalad> yeah
[2:47:39] <%JoshManVGH> @anuchallengertwitch In a manor of speaking! but you're always vaguely human shaped
[2:47:42] <%BinaryFireball> I stumbled on them pretty easy
[2:47:51] <NewWillinium> @anuchallengertwitch Kind of? The Character Origins are a bunch of humans, A Silver Dude, A Grey Dragon dude, and Old Fucker
[2:47:54] <%BinaryFireball> just go down
[2:47:55] <anuchallengertwitch> ok
[2:47:58] <RustyQuarters> @anuchallengertwitch Technically? You can make yourself unnatural colors and morph yourself out pretty good
[2:48:00] <knotsundownsyndrome> actively finding it is a bitch, but stumbling onto it isn't
[2:48:05] <%mornerboi> @JoshManVGH yeah it sort of depends on how loose your definition 'human' is
[2:48:13] <+TzarSalad> did Pat do the volcano manor stuff?
[2:48:15] <AllenDeadman> my elden ring is officially unplayable and 118 hours past the time for a refund so now I watch the orb man
[2:48:21] <TwistParabola> LOOK BACK
[2:48:24] <deviljhojho_> you can play as non humans but they look like humans with weird skin colors
[2:48:25] <+MarkoTolstov> Oh yeah I have no goddamn idea how anyone found it on their own it’s insane
[2:48:25] <jacksawjack> I was told there's a Superboss
[2:48:33] <%luftraumm1> oh alex died?
[2:48:42] <doster504> @AllenDeadman does it straight up not boot?
[2:48:46] <SomeOtherNeb> NICE
[2:48:48] <zenith0111> @allendeadman Wait for real?
[2:48:56] <%Valdorick> Oh that's where that is
[2:49:13] <AllenDeadman> @doster504 it boots but when I load any character it instantly closes itself
[2:49:28] <doster504> @AllenDeadman oh that fucking sucks sorry dude
[2:49:31] <AllenDeadman> and I've tried ALL the the common fixes
[2:49:32] <+Shishi1205> @jacksawjack who could that be
[2:49:33] <+PARARScs> could use some carpenters
[2:49:35] <anuchallengertwitch> Souls games have always intrigued me, but I'm not interested in playing them because the gameplay loop is not for me
[2:49:36] <%mornerboi> this area is just Fantasy Kansas
[2:49:47] <anuchallengertwitch> I do enjoy watching them played though
[2:49:49] <%cade_calrayn> Hey bitch
[2:49:52] <+Shishi1205> this fucker gives nothing
[2:49:53] <deviljhojho_> lmao
[2:49:54] <+Shishi1205> btw
[2:49:55] <knotsundownsyndrome> that fucking falling flat on your back
[2:49:57] <%cade_calrayn> he just slapped you out of the air lol
[2:49:57] <applefibs> how did you make your game unplayable @AllenDeadman
[2:49:58] <knotsundownsyndrome> holy shit
[2:50:00] <%NBUsagi> Crucible Knight is still real
[2:50:06] <jacksawjack> @jacksawjack I don't know, I was just told that there's a superboss
[2:50:06] <+Shishi1205> and he has a friend below
[2:50:08] <%Valdorick> He's being a Black Knight
[2:50:10] <knotsundownsyndrome> you got bitch slapped bro
[2:50:11] <+beansoup> LUL
[2:50:13] <klooswep> Got lost on his way back to the crucible
[2:50:14] <+beansoup> The anti air
[2:50:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> dude's got big numbers
[2:50:21] <@QueequegTheater> DS2 gets one last hit in
[2:50:25] <DigiDom> you can just run past him
[2:50:30] <%Atomik456> pretty sure this is where these dudes are from pat
[2:50:32] <mihokspawn> The non nerfed version of tail dragon dude
[2:50:33] <zenith0111> @anuchallengertwitch Oh so youre a common modern gamer Kappa
[2:50:36] <SomeOtherNeb> pound that crussy Pat
[2:50:44] <djblue_shift> i mean they got them dragon attacks so
[2:50:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> he's resisting like 75% of your damage lol
[2:50:50] <+Shishi1205> fire pouch
[2:50:52] <artdoz> thank god pat is online so I can cope with ups' failures
[2:50:54] <%cade_calrayn> @DigiDom Pat may be many things but he's not a coward
[2:51:01] <%cade_calrayn> wait, no Pat is a coward but still
[2:51:13] <Sunstalker> I think he's all of them D:
[2:51:14] <anuchallengertwitch> The magic shit the enemies do in this game is still sick
[2:51:15] <+Shishi1205> there's like 3 or 4 fire pouch dudes
[2:51:23] <knotsundownsyndrome> pat's all of the things
[2:51:25] <NewWillinium> It's weird that I never found a Crucible Knight Spirit ash anywhere
[2:51:30] <RustyQuarters> Why do these dudes get to be so cool?
[2:51:37] <%mornerboi> that angel wing shit is SO COOL
[2:51:41] <+Shishi1205> @NewWillinium I dont think there is
[2:51:42] <Sunstalker> Where's the crucible knight that summons the dragon dick?
[2:51:46] <%EldritchBee> @NewWillinium That would be TOO busted
[2:51:51] <deviljhojho_> busted open
[2:51:54] <deviljhojho_> HE GIVES NOTHING
[2:51:59] <+Shishi1205> yeah
[2:52:01] <DigiDom> nicely done
[2:52:02] <+Shishi1205> 7k runes
[2:52:06] <+Shishi1205> not even worth
[2:52:07] <$EsotericOdyssey> BEHIND
[2:52:09] <+TzarSalad> oh I hate that place your coming up on
[2:52:12] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt nah, there's only 16 of them and they never respawn.
[2:52:18] <%mornerboi> @NewWillinium nothing can be as busted as Mimic Tear +10
[2:52:19] <+TheMuuj> jobbers. you might call them cubicle knights
[2:52:24] <%cade_calrayn> 16 including the bosses you've fought
[2:52:38] <SomeOtherNeb> this place looks like a nightmare, can't wait to get there
[2:52:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> i'm curious how all these dragons got petrified
[2:52:45] <badhaye> You're about to find my favorite armor set
[2:52:46] <+Shishi1205> @cade_calrayn I think I've dealt with all of them then
[2:52:48] <%Dakuu75> Do you have to burn down the erdtree? or is that optional?
[2:52:56] <%cade_calrayn> BIRB
[2:53:00] <%Kevlar_Caviar> you gotta
[2:53:01] <Vyskus> pat has sooooooo many things that I never had on my first playthrough lmao
[2:53:01] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Birb
[2:53:01] <WeebFever> birds without knives
[2:53:02] <+Shishi1205> one of the new worst enemies
[2:53:03] <%Atomik456> @cade_calrayn do you guaranteed get their armour on 16 or?
[2:53:03] <%cade_calrayn> You have to, Dakuu
[2:53:06] <%dOjOTron> bird up
[2:53:08] <anuchallengertwitch> I love how in souls games, enemies and bosses get all of these wild attacks, meanwhile your just stuck with simple slashes and stabs, that still prove to e most effective
[2:53:08] <%pabloelenano2> bird up
[2:53:11] <+Shishi1205> worst as in they are really effective
[2:53:15] <badhaye> left
[2:53:26] <applefibs> @TheMuuj 🥁 🥁
[2:53:29] <%mornerboi> EXTEMDED dargon
[2:53:30] <%dekkitout> tajWHY We for real about this
[2:53:35] <%cade_calrayn> @Atomik456 a specific one drops it, I dunno which. there's 16 in the lore, I've seen 14-15 of them
[2:53:36] <zenith0111> Real Fake Dorr
[2:53:37] <PunkZedB> real fake doors
[2:53:49] <Strigiform> birds and dragons have joined forces
[2:53:57] <+Shishi1205> there are 2 armros
[2:53:57] <%cade_calrayn> Pat, maybe you should find the source of the lightning first
[2:54:01] <+Shishi1205> armors*
[2:54:06] <Parapattern> Ashumption
[2:54:14] <%Atomik456> @cade_calrayn cool i missed most of them incl that one on my run i guess
[2:54:16] <SomeOtherNeb> not a big fan of this crimson rot-looknig lightning
[2:54:17] <+Shishi1205> and at least 2 of their weapons
[2:54:18] <anuchallengertwitch> I wonder what a Mecha soulbourne game would be like.
[2:54:22] <+Shishi1205> they are faith based
[2:54:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[2:54:30] <zenith0111> This parts funny
[2:54:30] <badhaye> armor set behind you
[2:54:30] <%Rbeatononefour> Pat Boivin, reporting live from lightning hell
[2:54:32] <+Con_fusedDX> you sure?
[2:54:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> the sky
[2:54:34] <GoogleyGareth> It's the BIRDS
[2:54:34] <%mornerboi> "Bro stop with the Evil Lightning, you're scaring the hos."
[2:54:35] <+TzarSalad> its the little birds.
[2:54:35] <knotsundownsyndrome> i don't think so
[2:54:37] <SomeOtherNeb> maybe it's just a coincidence
[2:54:38] <%pabloelenano2> thays right...it comes from a random birds
[2:54:39] <%MorelK> its those damn bird aint it?
[2:54:40] <Ghufufin> i dunno its a pretty tough mystery
[2:54:44] <%cade_calrayn> this area is much easier to explore when you're not getting hit by lightning lol
[2:54:45] <Parapattern> You don't know that for sure
[2:54:45] <%BinaryFireball> the ground ya?
[2:54:47] <@Spydurman> hmmmmmmm
[2:54:48] <%Maids4lyfe> Miyazaki got tired of people complaining about lightning so he said fuck it, lighting for everyone
[2:54:49] <Lulu19> birds atr the worst
[2:54:53] <+Con_fusedDX> birds still hardest enemy in the game this far in
[2:54:56] <%kujofire990> But is it COOL LIGHTNING?
[2:54:57] <Midnight188> they added lightning to the wind and dragon swapmp. you know for flavor.
[2:54:57] <purple9z> friend ahead
[2:55:00] <%VHGS> fuck these birds for real tho
[2:55:01] <+TzarSalad> wut
[2:55:04] <+Shishi1205> @cade_calrayn there's one at the bottom of stormveil castle
[2:55:05] <+PARARScs> poor guy gave up
[2:55:07] <knotsundownsyndrome> why is he not attacking
[2:55:08] <Sunstalker> Wait, he was even agrod?
[2:55:08] <%dekkitout> A wins a win
[2:55:10] <knotsundownsyndrome> what the fuck?
[2:55:11] <PunkZedB> awww he's stupid
[2:55:11] <SomeOtherNeb> he just WANTS to die
[2:55:12] <+Shishi1205> he is a weak bitch
[2:55:13] <WeebFever> he's only programmed to do ranged attacks lol
[2:55:14] <%Atomik456> the shotgun beast miracle is the best for birds. its basically aa flak
[2:55:14] <%Willowight> just gives up
[2:55:14] <anuchallengertwitch> I think it's the giant reptile that's causing the lightning
[2:55:15] <%Bluwizard21> EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
[2:55:16] <badhaye> he's a friend and you killed him
[2:55:18] <Ekaelis> ??
[2:55:19] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt his AI broke
[2:55:21] <TwistParabola> he gave up
[2:55:22] <eleskei> mmk
[2:55:30] <+Shishi1205> take it
[2:55:30] <sothatsprettybrutal> brutal
[2:55:31] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt no his AI just broke
[2:55:31] <anuchallengertwitch> Also correct me if I'm wrong but that used to be a boss right?
[2:55:31] <jacksawjack> Drussy
[2:55:32] <%BinaryFireball> down now
[2:55:32] <%Monkeyweed21> he had a kidney stone
[2:55:35] <Parapattern> We take those
[2:55:37] <%MorelK> he was trying to hit the birds for you
[2:55:37] <knotsundownsyndrome> isn't there a really good item in this area chat
[2:55:38] <%Maids4lyfe> that made me sad
[2:55:39] <+Shishi1205> take that path
[2:55:40] <+TzarSalad> man ai breaks in this area for a few things
[2:55:40] <SomeOtherNeb> okay the lightning stopped when he kileld the dragon but that might not be 100% related
[2:55:42] <+Shishi1205> for talisman
[2:55:42] <%MorelK> and you kill him for it
[2:55:45] <knotsundownsyndrome> i'm fairly sure there's a somber in this area
[2:55:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh cool more seeds
[2:55:47] <DigiDom> a wins a win
[2:55:47] <PunkZedB> he was intimidated by your golden skeleton drip
[2:55:48] <+TzarSalad> literally the hidden bosses AI
[2:55:50] <IvanMistwalker> Drussy
[2:56:01] <anuchallengertwitch> WHAT was that Move?
[2:56:01] <zenith0111> That Dragon was the would be protagonists bestfriend
[2:56:05] <anuchallengertwitch> That looked sick
[2:56:09] <rommlll> what in the anime was that
[2:56:09] <knotsundownsyndrome> i have vague memories of picking up a somber stone here but i'm not 100%
[2:56:14] <%Rbeatononefour> need a shotgun for this crap
[2:56:19] <GoogleyGareth> Can't wait for the 1hr 30 min video essay on who that dragon is by VaatiVidya
[2:56:25] <medjoe> Can't wait for the Birdemic mod for this area
[2:56:28] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt there's a way down on the cliffs here
[2:56:29] <%EldritchBee> Somber Stone in the gazebo
[2:56:30] <rosabellamelantha> far l;eft
[2:56:30] <%Atomik456> @Rbeatononefour gurranq provides
[2:56:31] <%BinaryFireball> down yes yes
[2:56:39] <+Shishi1205> take the path behind the dragon
[2:56:41] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt left is optional
[2:56:46] <%dekkitout> Slabs for days
[2:56:54] <LMTTN> you see a gazebo
[2:56:56] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> They give those like candy here
[2:56:57] <knotsundownsyndrome> i remembered right
[2:57:01] <knotsundownsyndrome> not entirely crazy
[2:57:07] <anuchallengertwitch> I know I'm late, but can we go back to the fact that he just summoned a Dragon head as a stand and shot a Shoop Da Whoop? was that a normal move?
[2:57:13] <%EldritchBee> I shoot the gazebo with my bow
[2:57:20] <%Maids4lyfe> From Software wants you to have fun
[2:57:22] <%EldritchBee> @anuchallengertwitch He's been doing that the entire game
[2:57:26] <+Shishi1205> look
[2:57:31] <%Atomik456> @anuchallengertwitch he gfot that move session one lol
[2:57:36] <+Shishi1205> more knights
[2:57:37] <%NBUsagi> oh hey Dragon knights
[2:57:43] <+leyk36> SHIT I NEVER SAW THIS AREA
[2:57:44] <%CryoByjorne> isn't there a bug where it makes some weapons weaker at +25 than +24?
[2:57:50] <GoogleyGareth> Fuckin love guard counters
[2:58:00] <anuchallengertwitch> @anuchallengertwitch Ok. I'm intrigued
[2:58:02] <%EldritchBee> @CryoByjorne Just a display bug, they're not actually weaker
[2:58:07] <+TzarSalad> @CryoByjorne yes. greatsword is one of them
[2:58:17] <RustyQuarters> I haven't been consistently watching has the new weapon been worth? @PatStaresAt
[2:58:31] <+orochiblood> face to foot style, how ya like it
[2:58:33] <%NBUsagi> oh he is just an actual Dragoon
[2:58:36] <%Maids4lyfe> @anuchallengertwitch there's multiple versions of that spell, some breathe fire, lightning, ice, magic, or disease
[2:58:37] <%JoshManVGH> How long Pat got till credits?
[2:58:46] <zenith0111> @eldritchbee Ooooh wtf I was just sitting on +24 worrying but if its just a display glitch time to max it
[2:58:51] <deviljhojho_> I say 9 more hours
[2:58:52] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @JoshManVGH A GOOD BIT
[2:58:52] <Frostydough1> 34 hours give or take 10
[2:58:53] <+Shishi1205> a bit long
[2:58:54] <deviljhojho_> aprox
[2:58:57] <%JoshManVGH> Was asking chat!
[2:58:57] <mrtanaka111> pat is only halfway through the game
[2:58:58] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat has the power of god and anime
[2:58:59] <Istrael25> Go go go
[2:58:59] <mikesapartment> like 3-4 hours
[2:58:59] <+AyupaPupa> 8 more hours
[2:59:00] <DigiDom> not long
[2:59:01] <+FlappySeal_> 69 hours
[2:59:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> we're in the last 80 hours now
[2:59:03] <%Maids4lyfe> 8 hours
[2:59:03] <BigBruthaThunda> time is convoluted in the lands between
[2:59:05] <NewWillinium> I'd see Pat being finished by 1 AM
[2:59:05] <%EldritchBee> anywhere from 1 to 100 hours
[2:59:06] <XxMoliciousxX> credits?  he's still in world 1 map 1
[2:59:08] <knotsundownsyndrome> 5 - 7 hrs
[2:59:08] <%dekkitout> The credits were the friends we made along the way
[2:59:09] <Parapattern> You beat this boss and the map unfolds to be 12x larger
[2:59:10] <anuchallengertwitch> @Maids4lyfe Ok sweet. I enjoy eldritch/ beast adjacent super powers
[2:59:11] <%cade_calrayn> oh you thought this was a shortcut? Nahhhhh
[2:59:12] <+Shishi1205> yes
[2:59:12] <james_uu> Seen any speedruns yet or holding off in case of Spoilies?
[2:59:12] <Midnight188> cant wait for vaati to give us the lowdown on the story
[2:59:15] <%cade_calrayn> you got punked
[2:59:15] <+Shishi1205> new
[2:59:23] <rosabellamelantha> new
[2:59:24] <deviljhojho_> 4 more hours and that should wrap up the second act
[2:59:28] <zecht89> i think this is the dragon lord path
[2:59:35] <mrtanaka111> is pat aiming for the secret alien dogs ending?
[2:59:37] <zenith0111> After getting near the end of the game is when I start losing the story tbh
[2:59:37] <BigBruthaThunda> i think wr is around 40 minutes lol
[2:59:38] <%EldritchBee> Once you finish this you leave the lands between and go to the Lands that the Lands Between are Between
[2:59:39] <%cade_calrayn> No, it's not, zecht
[2:59:45] <RyuuAoi> Peach ain't gonna let us win tonight! LUL NotLikeThis
[2:59:45] <%JoshManVGH> between 1 and 10,000 hours? Understood
[2:59:53] <zertle> fuck this game is gorgeous
[3:00:00] <%anoldtoilet> yeah its cool that the more you learn about the story the less things come together and make sense
[3:00:00] <%dmbender> knocking people off ledges is so fun
[3:00:03] <%anoldtoilet> from soft ftw
[3:00:14] <%JoshManVGH> Theres always cheese
[3:00:14] <+Shishi1205> you will have tot ry
[3:00:15] <anuchallengertwitch> I wonder what a mecha soulsborne game would be like. Would that interest anyone?
[3:00:16] <BigBruthaThunda> dont worry the last boss has AI bugs
[3:00:16] <%Atomik456> @BigBruthaThunda im more interested in the all great enemies glitchless category
[3:00:17] <%pabloelenano2> pat plz
[3:00:18] <%dekkitout> Then Greg will beat it
[3:00:21] <+Shishi1205> its not a cakewalk
[3:00:21] <GrenYena> Uninstall
[3:00:22] <deviljhojho_> i'll smply lose all respect for your build
[3:00:26] <+heiro001> player: "alright, burned the Erdtree, game complete!" FromSoftware: "lmao, lol"
[3:00:27] <%SaiyanShoto> Is Pats motivation to beat this tonight him gloating to Woolie that he beat it on the podcast
[3:00:27] <chernabogs_bane> if you beat malenia then you are definitely beating the final boss
[3:00:29] <ape_hawk> then grumblo and splenya wont get married
[3:00:30] <+SilverDevilfish> What if the final boss is Radahn dual wielding Malenias
[3:00:30] <eleskei> i want scifi fromsoft
[3:00:31] <%dmbender> just summon the mimic and sit down
[3:00:32] <DigiDom> if you beat melenia its cool#
[3:00:33] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Its a final boss on a souls game, you already know the answer to it
[3:00:34] <zecht89> @cade_calrayn oh ok, i missed it myself i just wanted to finish the game at this point
[3:00:35] <%EldritchBee> IDK, pat
[3:00:36] <+Shishi1205> look another
[3:00:39] <james_uu> Hoarfrost wins
[3:00:41] <@Spydurman> take a shot at the title
[3:00:43] <%mornerboi> what is that dragon sorcerery
[3:00:43] <GhostPyre> you can cheee any boss in the game
[3:00:44] <%anoldtoilet> im very excited for miyazakis next armored core
[3:00:45] <%Maids4lyfe> melania is nothing
[3:00:46] <%EldritchBee> Just you wait and see the Final
[3:00:54] <+beansoup> Melania took me like 3 hours to beat
[3:00:55] <cayitoz> why can't i ever escape crucible knight
[3:00:56] <anuchallengertwitch> Doctor Octagonapus BLAA
[3:00:59] <%anoldtoilet> if no one's familiar with armored core its also a great series with weighty, committal combat
[3:01:01] <baphometseinfeld> If you can't beat it then Miyazaki himself will tell you he is disappointed in you
[3:01:06] <+Shishi1205> melania is the hardest boss of the game
[3:01:10] <purple9z> the final boss is a tag fight with Melania and radahn with no summons trust me
[3:01:12] <%SveriSageAdvice> lol Melania was harder than the upcoming boss
[3:01:20] <%mornerboi> CHUNKY hit

[3:01:58] <mrtanaka111> mileena
[3:01:59] <%SaiyanShoto> In usual souls fashion I imagine to some people Melania is easy but a super easy boss is hard to them

[3:03:21] <Broslff> Same, its so much just to get a awful talisman
[3:03:22] <WeebFever> There's also a path down to the left of the bird building that leads to some cool things
[3:03:23] <mrcelab> no torrent here?
[3:03:24] <%Monkeyweed21> @Ghufufin according to Ranni "Char" the Witch yes it is
[3:03:25] <RustyQuarters> Pat is a known enemy of birds
[3:03:30] <%Kevlar_Caviar> chat try not to spoil challenge second 1
[3:03:31] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt there's like 3 hidden paths around this area and 2 of them lead to cool shit
[3:03:32] <%mornerboi> @stinkyboyinc Birds are evil, cold hearted creatures incapable of love.
[3:03:36] <anuchallengertwitch> That tornado in the background looks cool
[3:03:40] <@QueequegTheater> You come back tomorrow
[3:03:43] <%BinaryFireball> maybe I'm wrong
[3:03:52] <stinkyboyinc> if i was a bird and a golden skeleton came at me i would simply fly away
[3:03:53] <RustyQuarters> wakey wakery :)
[3:03:58] <anuchallengertwitch> @stinkyboyinc Naturally, as birds are the descendants of Dinosaurs
[3:03:59] <%JoshManVGH> Man I want a washing poll
[3:04:06] <+Shishi1205> @BinaryFireball its near at least
[3:04:08] <mrtanaka111> CURVED SWORDS

[3:04:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> that's a cool lookin sword
[3:04:26] <%EldritchBee> Grace to the right
[3:04:28] <%Monkeyweed21> Strength scimitar
[3:04:29] <%Kevlar_Caviar> streamer: doing an area that is very clearly before that boss | some dude in chat: HEY DID YOU DO THAT BOSS YET
[3:04:30] <+Shishi1205> right there lmao
[3:04:32] <+Smokebanshee> Hidden boss down this cliff, but keep going forward for a grace
[3:04:32] <%BinaryFireball> I think I saw it below just now
[3:04:35] <RubberFistFight> this area makes me constantly anxious
[3:04:38] <anuchallengertwitch> @stinkyboyinc wait, is pat's character literally a skeleton? I can't tell
[3:04:39] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt You can get to the secret boss from here.  But get to the next grace first.
[3:04:39] <+Shishi1205> you just saw the hidden path
[3:04:48] <+Shishi1205> not below
[3:04:48] <james_uu> Go there now
[3:04:50] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt go up for the next grace first
[3:04:51] <%EldritchBee> Grace is NOT below
[3:04:55] <$sarah_galb> grace now
[3:04:56] <%SveriSageAdvice> you'll want to grab the grace in the building near you, that's the path you want to go after you grab it
[3:04:56] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt no grace below you
[3:04:57] <%EldritchBee> Grace is to the right, below is the boss
[3:04:58] <+TzarSalad> no
[3:04:58] <rosabellamelantha> above
[3:05:00] <+Shishi1205> thats the hidden path to the secret boss
[3:05:01] <%mornerboi> trust us you can make it
[3:05:02] <$ArcanumArcanum> don't listen to ONE GUY
[3:05:02] <$sarah_galb> then jump down

[3:05:04] <%Valdorick> There's a grace nearby, but NOT there
[3:05:04] <%BinaryFireball> that's it but grace first
[3:05:05] <+Rofiarf> do it anyway
[3:05:05] <+xSiggsx> dont do hidden path yet, but it is
[3:05:07] <$EsotericOdyssey> grace first

[3:06:29] <%AsherCaelum> Fromsoft creates such inventive fantasy creatures, like birds
[3:06:31] <applefibs> what if a harpy had woman feet instead of bird feet
[3:06:45] <+SaintSalted> i think pat looks like a sexy blue dicked gold skeleton
[3:06:47] <stinkyboyinc> birds are cool i wish they existed in real life
[3:06:54] <+heiro001> considerably less threatening harpy
[3:06:54] <%Bluwizard21> he died as he lived. a jar
[3:07:02] <mrtanaka111> i wish australia was real

[3:07:36] <$sarah_galb> yes
[3:07:36] <+Smokebanshee> ye
[3:07:38] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> yes
[3:07:40] <+Shishi1205> I think so

[3:07:50] <DigiDom> yep
[3:07:51] <%Kevlar_Caviar> you know that drop you said wasn't viable? you were wrong
[3:08:09] <+TzarSalad> middle window
[3:08:11] <GoogleyGareth> Follow the bloodstains
[3:08:13] <$sarah_galb> past the lightning room
[3:08:15] <+KinguinHD> @PatStaresAt If ive watched you/woolie play every souls game but never played one myself, should i start here?
[3:08:17] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt back out front
[3:08:18] <cryall> check the ledges before the altar room
[3:08:20] <james_uu> Yeah small drop at edge opposite that gank church entrance
[3:08:24] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt that cliff you were on earlier it's on the EDGE of that
[3:08:25] <TwistParabola> past the lightning room
[3:08:25] <+AGood_Noodle> Just tuned in. What did I miss?
[3:08:25] <mrtanaka111> seek but hole
[3:08:25] <PunkZedB> it's past the enemies, you'll see a bunch of bloodstains because the jump is mildly difficult when running from enemies
[3:08:26] <%BinaryFireball> sry for being anxious about you finding it 😂
[3:08:31] <anuchallengertwitch> wait a minute, is this background music I'm hearing? In a non boss area?
[3:08:35] <+Shishi1205> btw this place and millicent's quests are obligatory if you want to free yourself of a locked ending
[3:08:55] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @anuchallengertwitch have you not watched any of the streams until now? LUL
[3:08:59] <NewWillinium> This place as in this shrine area right here?
[3:08:59] <%Atomik456> looking forward to this i missed this on my run going blind
[3:09:04] <RubberFistFight> @Shishi1205 he's already done millicent's quest yesterday and gotten miquella's needle. IDK if he's gone through the Scary Door yet though.
[3:09:15] <anuchallengertwitch> @anuchallengertwitch honestly no.
[3:09:20] <+Shishi1205> @RubberFistFight don't think so
[3:09:23] <oda_flobunaga> Exactly
[3:09:26] <pretendofriendo> watching pat play and pretending I have a PS5 edition!
[3:09:26] <%BinaryFireball> it's too. late for scary door I think
[3:09:26] <+TzarSalad> btw the run to this boss fuckings sucks
[3:09:28] <mrtanaka111> giant cotton candy
[3:09:29] <anuchallengertwitch> This is the first I'm really looking into this game
[3:09:40] <+FlappySeal_> oh boi here we go
[3:09:40] <%Monkeyweed21> could you imagine another hiding this much unique content behind total bullshit like this?
[3:09:44] <%EldritchBee> @anuchallengertwitch Pat is literally a few hours from credits rolling
[3:09:45] <%AHomeschoolDropout> God Christ I can't believe I missed this
[3:09:45] <+Shishi1205> @TzarSalad thank god I first tried him
[3:09:48] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight he really should, the scene is cool, but it's his call ultimately. I think he's worried it'll torch his save.
[3:09:51] <%Monkeyweed21> *another game
[3:09:54] <+Shishi1205> to your place
[3:09:58] <%sniffy77> fromsoft kinda nailed the jumping in this game
[3:09:59] <james_uu> Strap in and strap on
[3:10:00] <oda_flobunaga> So, bets on a one shot?
[3:10:00] <XxMoliciousxX> is that.....the elden ring?
[3:10:04] <+TzarSalad> hopefully it doesnt glitch out on you like it did several times to me
[3:10:04] <+Shishi1205> lay down
[3:10:05] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt NOW JUMP IN Kappa

[3:17:33] <RubberFistFight> @Wisconsinite given the involvement with the needle and the Frenzied Flame of Proscription door, I would say yeah, Placidusax is definitely on their side.
[3:17:34] <%anoldtoilet> shes supposed to be a Carian sorcerer who does full moon magic and the one we fight that Ranni makes uses primeval glintstone sorcery
[3:17:35] <+heiro001> punished King Ghidorah

[3:17:44] <knotsundownsyndrome> he is the baddest
[3:17:44] <Varanoo> His missing head is in the shrine

[3:17:46] <%Valdorick> Boss Soul Lore*
[3:17:49] <%dekkitout> The hugest dargon to ever ball
[3:17:49] <RubberFistFight> lightning dag-ron
[3:17:49] <%JoshManVGH> So what does the needle do when you use it?
[3:17:49] <deviljhojho_> a dragon so nice they made him thrice
[3:17:49] <TwistParabola> Dargonlord
[3:17:51] <rosabellamelantha> The OG Dragon
[3:17:54] <CptHarlok> He sure is a mean dagron
[3:17:56] <oda_flobunaga> Straignt up Best Dargon Fight From has made
[3:17:59] <+heiro001> love it
[3:17:59] <AllenDeadman> and he's not even at 100%, he seems pretty messed up
[3:17:59] <%abakkus> nailed it
[3:18:00] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[3:18:01] <dan_g_v> nailed it!
[3:18:02] <deviljhojho_> the real challenge is getting to it
[3:18:03] <BYAKURENLOVER763> he actually had 4 heads
[3:18:04] <V0LK__> this run back sucks LUL
[3:18:05] <james_uu> I miss Oleg
[3:18:05] <eleskei> yea
[3:18:05] <+Smokebanshee> THE Dragonlord
[3:18:05] <TwistParabola> F
[3:18:06] <+Shishi1205> he has a long stump, a short one then another around his other arm
[3:18:07] <pretendofriendo> you did it
[3:18:10] <RubberFistFight> he even has a big beefy arm coming out of his back
[3:18:12] <+Shishi1205> so he had 5 heads
[3:18:12] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt an item calls him the Elden Lord of the age before the Erdtree
[3:18:14] <%Cozy90> psaDab psaDab
[3:18:14] <%dekkitout> Of all the graces to spam here, whynot one at that shallow ditch
[3:18:14] <%SaiyanShoto> Sick
[3:18:17] <%NBUsagi> When your so high level that your worst enemy is gravity
[3:18:18] <%Artoo__The_Me> @binaryfireball Thanks for the gift! psaDab
[3:18:20] <bluefootedtpeack> any one else think it's weird that the 4 limbed dragons with wings don't give dragon hearts,   but the wyvern's, wyrms and drakes all do.
[3:18:26] <%zarkazeon> it actually looked like he had 4 or 5 heads at some point
[3:18:31] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I wonder how his head got placed in the dragon duo hall
[3:18:33] <ElSuperNova> Big fire boi weak to the hoarfrost
[3:18:35] <Ghufufin> this is only 40% of his power
[3:18:38] <+heiro001> lol, finally some primordial dragons we can actually fight
[3:18:38] <knotsundownsyndrome> @cade_calrayn do you know what that item is?
[3:18:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> the end of an era
[3:18:52] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt The last upgrade items are apparently his scales
[3:18:52] <TwistParabola> The Times Before
[3:18:53] <BigBruthaThunda> but its old now
[3:18:53] <%NBUsagi> So is Elden Lord just basically like "yeah your god of gods" or whatever?
[3:18:53] <+Shishi1205> his spell maybe
[3:18:55] <AllenDeadman> faded glory, an enemy at it's worst, but still being a bad-ass
[3:18:57] <$EsotericOdyssey> @cade_calrayn it's his remembrance
[3:19:02] <Ethel9727> "Look how badass this thing is. Now think about the fact this is 1% of his power and he's basically dead."
[3:19:03] <%cade_calrayn> @knotsundownsyndrome I wanna say it's his remembrance, or an item you get from it
[3:19:04] <zecht89> this game is set 100% in dark souls' world
[3:19:05] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You fight Radahn at 1% of his power
[3:19:05] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt And you beat him to death at SL 1 with a stick
[3:19:07] <Ekaelis> Scuffed Ghidorah
[3:19:11] <%JoshManVGH> Entropy!
[3:19:14] <TwistParabola> Radahn was a great example of that
[3:19:17] <%EldritchBee> @NBUsagi It's the "I'm the Chosen of God" kinda
[3:19:18] <RubberFistFight> so people are saying the 3 fingers = what's left of his 3 missing heads?
[3:19:20] <mrtanaka111> @zecht89 no,soft just likes reusing ideas
[3:19:21] <%EldritchBee> Like the hypeman for God
[3:19:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> you only have a chance because they're basically already dead
[3:19:21] <bluefootedtpeack> radahn. poisoned by rot,  holding back space,  takes a whole army to fight
[3:19:22] <oda_flobunaga> Elden John Dragon
[3:19:28] <%Atomik456> so was marika getting some of that dragon dick?
[3:19:28] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah you beat Radahn when Radahn was a zombie shell of rot
[3:19:28] <AllenDeadman> Radahn was driven insane and rotting from the inside
[3:19:29] <pretendofriendo> if that dragon is BUSTED NOW who fought him before?
[3:19:31] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt TBF you beat Malenia at full power
[3:19:32] <Ekaelis> It's like with Gwyn, you fight his charred husk
[3:19:33] <DigiDom> fire giant is the low point of the ending, the bosses are pretty cool from here on
[3:19:39] <knotsundownsyndrome> being an elden lord is nebulous
[3:19:42] <RubberFistFight> So then what the fuck are the 2 fingers and why do they seem like an entire race of things?
[3:19:51] <sothatsprettybrutal> kind of wild lorewise that you have no trouble respawning after dying in this backwards-in-time battlezone
[3:19:51] <knotsundownsyndrome> it by no means makes you a god
[3:19:54] <+heiro001> but also all the dragon lords and whatnot are king's field 1-3 references
[3:19:55] <zecht89> @zecht89 what do you mean no?
[3:20:00] <%Artoo__The_Me> I love that you can clearly see a neck is missing
[3:20:01] <%justcallmebobplease> @pretendofriendo Well, if it was the Elden Lord BEFORE the Erdtree, and the Erdtree's some alien thing...
[3:20:06] <V0LK__> wait, it seems like he had more than 3 heads, there's a floopy neck there too
[3:20:08] <%dekkitout> As lame as that Netflix Godzilla trilogy was, it had the hands down best Ghidorah
[3:20:14] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Hey! Remember when Yugi Fused the Mammoth Graveyard to the Blue Eyes Ultimate dragon? This is him now lol
[3:20:16] <V0LK__> he had 5! its actually TIAMAT
[3:20:21] <@QueequegTheater> @zecht89 There's no evidence whatsoever
[3:20:23] <RubberFistFight> holy shit there ARE a total of 3 stumps on him!
[3:20:24] <pretendofriendo> did he lose a fight with GOD?
[3:20:27] <+Shishi1205> @pretendofriendo If you have done the ending then you know the truth
[3:20:28] <mrtanaka111> ghidoras arrivan in the net series was GREAT
[3:20:29] <%Freakin_Wolfy> I know Pat got into the Capital through a backdoor, did he ever fight the draconic Tree sentinel guarding the entrance?
[3:20:30] <TwistParabola> BLEED
[3:20:34] <eleskei> tiamat is a goddess
[3:20:37] <ElSuperNova> Shredded
[3:20:38] <+cronx90> Never noticed before that there was a third head, but it's missing
[3:20:43] <eleskei> a grandmother sea god
[3:20:45] <+wizard_of_diamonds> God this boss is so awesome
[3:20:47] <AllenDeadman> dude is missing 3 of his heads, his skin is falling apart.... AND STILL he is coming at you
[3:20:48] <PunkZedB> there's 4 stumps actually, one is below on his right/our left
[3:20:51] <+gamemas10> 5 heads like fingers on a hand
[3:20:52] <Midnight188> apparently his ai sometimes breaks after a dive and he just sits there
[3:20:52] <oda_flobunaga> @Freakin_Wolfy he did
[3:21:00] <+Shishi1205> @PunkZedB yeah

[3:22:43] <sirrice77> Remembrance of Dragonlord Placidusax, hewn into the Erdtree.  The power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader. Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.  The Dragonlord whose seat lies at the heart of the storm beyond time is said to have been Elden Lord in the age before the Erdtree. Once his god was fled, the lord continued to await its return.
[3:22:44] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt The Dragonlord whose seat lies at the heart of the storm beyond time is said to have been Elden Lord in the age before the Erdtree. Once his god was fled, the lord continued to await its return.

[3:22:47] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt it said that Placidusax was Elden Lord before the age of the Erdtrree, AND that his god FLED

[3:23:44] <knotsundownsyndrome> @PatStaresAt how's it feel to become king ghidorah
[3:23:45] <%watts121> And it tracks.
[3:23:47] <soapyillusions7> Is this NG+
[3:23:48] <TwistParabola> lol. lmao
[3:23:48] <%EldritchBee> It looks cool but can only hit like 4-5 times
[3:23:53] <RubberFistFight> so i think what happens is they write a full, complete and detailed story for these games and then feed some poor intern a bunch of meth and LSD and let them edit it.
[3:23:56] <+Shishi1205> one shot
[3:23:56] <%BinaryFireball> dragon king pat
[3:23:57] <%EldritchBee> @soapyillusions7 No
[3:23:59] <brainflint> good for big groups
[3:23:59] <+AyupaPupa> become dragon
[3:23:59] <Mitchellsocks> KIng Ghidorah, the Space MNonster
[3:24:00] <Sunstalker> I love when the games talk about bulshit weird gods and hierarchies. Eternal Darkness vibes. That LP was so good
[3:24:00] <%dekkitout> Gold Dragon Skeleton
[3:24:01] <BigFingerRo> good ol endgame weapons
[3:24:02] <+AGood_Noodle> This is the best game ever nade

[3:24:04] <%NBUsagi> Pat has ascended to become DragonLord
[3:24:05] <+pupil31> I'M SHOOTIN MY LAZER
[3:24:05] <$sassyquatch963> ooh nice range
[3:24:10] <%Kevlar_Caviar> AND IT DOES DAMAGE WHEN YOU SUMMON IT
[3:24:11] <RubberFistFight> that is fucking obscene lol
[3:24:11] <%BinaryFireball> so is that the third head?
[3:24:11] <+Con_fusedDX> room clearer
[3:24:13] <+ScrapKingKeita> It also seems to have different type of scaling as well
[3:24:14] <Shardlab> DAYUM
[3:24:14] <HeroToxiko> The Glow starts playing
[3:24:15] <Saturation_Lizard> the lightning spark that appears when you summon the head does a short AOE damage proc, like a mini WoG @PatStaresAt
[3:24:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> its just a fucking laser
[3:24:17] <mrtanaka111> sure
[3:24:17] <TwistParabola> great range

[3:24:21] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt so now that's 6 Outer Gods you've heard of: The Greater Will, The Frenzied Flame, The Formless Mother, The Dark Moon, The Scarlet Rot, and The Dragon God
[3:24:23] <BYAKURENLOVER763> the one closest to it
[3:24:23] <morkelebmink> JESUS laser dragon
[3:24:24] <digaogrunge> I would consider exchanging talismans, your ST is low now @PatStaresAt
[3:24:25] <BigFingerRo> @pupil31 FIRIN' my lazer, get your lore right
[3:24:25] <oda_flobunaga> That one
[3:24:26] <TwistParabola> DRAGON SKELETON
[3:24:27] <%Bailey__Gaming> attach your extra power talisman too
[3:24:29] <%Artoo__The_Me> @patstaresat you can turn while using it
[3:24:29] <$sassyquatch963> greatbrdige is the most progressed bonfire you got
[3:24:29] <%AHomeschoolDropout> You ever read the monuments around the world that tells you how much of a badass Malenia is?
[3:24:30] <%EldritchBee> His weapon's Ash makes you do the flying thundercloud attack
[3:24:30] <STORMWIZARD1> @PatStaresAt Ok now go find a Dragon SMOrc
[3:24:31] <TwistParabola> that one
[3:24:35] <%dekkitout> This calls for a mod that turns Elden Ring into a muso game SeriousSloth
[3:24:36] <MildMannered_Creighton> oh look, guts
[3:24:38] <mrtanaka111> no needle incoming
[3:24:40] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Gold Skeleton's are over rated
[3:24:40] <BYAKURENLOVER763> heh
[3:24:51] <+Shishi1205> yes
[3:24:53] <Ner234> Go squeeze your dg
[3:24:53] <TwistParabola> hehehe
[3:24:54] <DigiDom> yep
[3:24:57] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Red Skeletons are where its at
[3:24:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> Did you say poop poop
[3:25:01] <BigFingerRo> How old is Geif again?
[3:25:01] <ElSuperNova> YEA
[3:25:02] <%EldritchBee> Watch him get got by Tree Sentinel
[3:25:03] <%Bluwizard21> uh oh
[3:25:03] <eleskei> babby needs to bathroom
[3:25:04] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[3:25:04] <roguemephilesclone> Oh yeah, that Dark Souls 3 Musou mod would be INCREDIBLE in Elden Ring.
[3:25:07] <Omenaire_> TIME TO PISS
[3:25:08] <Saturation_Lizard> short run for a fun boss :)
[3:25:16] <%Bluwizard21> he left standin on the bridge, does the dragon sentinel come down that far?
[3:25:17] <%JoshManVGH> What do you all think is going to happen when people who started with Elden Ring go backwards?
[3:25:19] <bluefootedtpeack> red skeletons are sick, like when ghost rider heat up
[3:25:24] <+twdlrr> Quick Paige take screenshots
[3:25:29] <Ner234> @BigFingerRo 2? I think
[3:25:33] <soapyillusions7> Hey chat, is this NG+?
[3:25:33] <+AGood_Noodle> Can someone tell me what the gold needle would do during that fight?
[3:25:42] <roguemephilesclone> Elden Ring is actually built for Musou levels of enemies.
[3:25:42] <PanicSwytch> Did Pat beat the game or is he almost there?
[3:25:45] <SocialMisfitGamer> @soapyillusions7 no
[3:25:46] <RyuuAoi> @bigfingerro He's gotta be like two now.
[3:25:49] <%JoshManVGH> @soapyillusions7 Just NG
[3:25:54] <%geekjacob> i donlt believe so
[3:25:55] <%dekkitout> @JoshManVGH The same when people go from Skyrim immediately to Morrowind, peaks and valleys
[3:25:58] <bluefootedtpeack> @AGood_Noodle nothing, it cures the frenzied flame status so you get a diffefrent ending, pat didn't need to do it though
[3:25:58] <V0LK__> yeah, what that needle do in the fight?
[3:26:00] <RubberFistFight> @zecht89 actually i think this game is set in the period immediately before Sekiro. Change my mind.
[3:26:06] <pretendofriendo> GivePLZ MercyWing1 PowerUpL RaccAttack PowerUpR MercyWing2 TakeNRG
[3:26:09] <%anoldtoilet> @AGood_Noodle it doesnt do anything regarding the fight, but if you have accepted the frenzied flame this gets rid of it
[3:26:19] <RubberFistFight> @V0LK__ nothing. You use it after the fight and it purges you of the flame.
[3:26:28] <%anoldtoilet> frenzied flame ending locks you in and thats the only way to get out and do a different ending
[3:26:29] <+AGood_Noodle> Ah gotcha
[3:26:31] <RubberFistFight> it's the fight ARENA that's the crucial element
[3:26:33] <RubberFistFight> not the fight itself.
[3:26:34] <V0LK__> ohh I see
[3:26:53] <pretendofriendo> I wonder how elmo is doing
[3:27:00] <bluefootedtpeack> i guess the frenzy god's influence is weak there or something,
[3:27:01] <%JoshManVGH> Oh so if Pat used it he would have been fucked out of his ending?
[3:27:11] <RyuuAoi> @bigfingerro Sorry. He's 14.
[3:27:15] <sweetkek> Isn't this from poptepipic?
[3:27:27] <RubberFistFight> @JoshManVGH No. Not at all.
[3:28:02] <RyuuAoi> @pretendofriendo Hiding from ICE clearly ha
[3:28:07] <Midnight188> yo theres a silver pendant equivalent on an npc invasion to help with this boss? wish i knew that ebfore getting pounded for an hour.
[3:28:12] <%JoshManVGH> Oh, then what ending is he aiming for?
[3:28:22] <knotsundownsyndrome> @bluefootedtpeack it's a place beyond time. it could be miquella's needle, alongside the warp, basically makes it so you never even got the burn in the first place and couldn't have
[3:28:22] <ElSuperNova> Also can avoid wife burning herself while also getting a better ending
[3:28:36] <oda_flobunaga> @JoshManVGH Stars Probably
[3:28:39] <RubberFistFight> @JoshManVGH if you go through the door in the frenzied flame proscription, you meet the three fingers, they grab you and you absorb them and take ownership of the Frenzied Flame. You are then locked to that ending UNLESS you use Miquella's needle in Placidusax' arena to purge yourself of the flame.
[3:28:49] <%cade_calrayn> Elmo is no doubt surveying his kingdom from atop his tower
[3:29:08] <%cade_calrayn> as he is the one true Elden Lord of the Pat & Peach household
[3:29:16] <NewWillinium> Another question. Is it ever explained whey Melinia has the bit of eye gunk around her left eye? And why it's gone if you do the Frenzied Flame ending?
[3:29:24] <%abakkus> psaWink
[3:29:39] <RubberFistFight> Unfortunately because uninformed dipshits screamed about it "immediately ending the game" and "fucking up the save", he didn't do it. So i doubt we'll get to see that, but i could be wrong.
[3:29:55] <%cade_calrayn> All hail the Emlo, he of the big screm.
[3:29:59] <bluefootedtpeack> @bluefootedtpeack good shout, farum azula seems to eb stuck at the point of it's collapse,
[3:30:01] <%JoshManVGH> Aah
[3:30:18] <RubberFistFight> @NewWillinium It's a magical tattoo and if i had to guess, it's some kind of power seal, like what Alucard has on his gloves in the OG run of Hellsing.
[3:30:48] <%Sir_JackalI> Oh I got gifted a sub. Thanks person that did that
[3:30:49] <%cade_calrayn> I'm pretty sure Pat just said he didn't like the whole chaos ending idea anyways, so it doesn't matter. Pat seems set on Ranni's ending
[3:31:29] <pretendofriendo> everyone is this chat seems to have a PS5
[3:31:40] <LMTTN> I'm on PS4
[3:31:49] <RubberFistFight> @cade_calrayn which is fine. he can always look up the cutscene on the youtubes or somethin. There's a little bit of extra/different dialogue with melina immediately after it too.
[3:31:49] <+Shishi1205> I've done all of them (with 2 variations) and ranni's one is the ebst
[3:31:58] <+leyk36> @PatStaresAt Go the opposite way from the boss first. There's an encounter that's missable if you dont
[3:32:03] <%JoshManVGH> PUPPERS!

[3:33:18] <tanarath> It wants to focus on Zangief
[3:33:19] <1dennis> man hes become big
[3:33:23] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt yeah, Logitech cameras don't save their settings, you need to re-set them every damn time.
[3:33:24] <%cade_calrayn> or it wants to focus on Elmo
[3:33:24] <knotsundownsyndrome> that's the camera's heart pulse
[3:33:27] <pretendofriendo> pat is now Burger Slave
[3:33:28] <senfood> Never eat those peach rings. They're not for sare and super limited in number.
[3:33:30] <%abakkus> zoom
[3:33:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> The camera knows the star of the show is zangief

[3:36:59] <bluefootedtpeack> warmaster's shack/volcano manor man
[3:37:01] <+pupil31> PUNK'D
[3:37:01] <Lulu19> gank squad
[3:37:03] <RyuuAoi> You thought
[3:37:03] <+SaintSalted> cuz he a hater
[3:37:04] <%HiroProtagonest> lmao no iframes on that animation
[3:37:09] <%cade_calrayn> He opposes the Greater Will, Pat, and you want to be Elden Lord
[3:37:10] <sirrice77> because he's a dick
[3:37:11] <%BlackStarAura> why male models?
[3:37:12] <+Rofiarf> which you didn't get
[3:37:13] <+Shishi1205> different chest
[3:37:13] <GrenYena> Surely Kappa
[3:37:13] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt if you kill him you will know why
[3:37:16] <%HiroProtagonest> The devs know, they knooow
[3:37:16] <PunkZedB> that was the most calm walk into the arms of death I have ever seen
[3:37:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> you thought
[3:37:17] <+Shishi1205> no invincibility
[3:37:18] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Mugged
[3:37:19] <+heiro001> yep
[3:37:20] <+LandOfTheWay> guess since the manor is gone he's just invading whoever the fuck
[3:37:20] <oda_flobunaga> Good Job
[3:37:21] <RyuuAoi> Mmhmm
[3:37:24] <mrtanaka111> invisibility frames where patched out
[3:37:26] <V0LK__> anti cheese tecnology
[3:37:29] <Finchit> copium
[3:37:32] <ElSuperNova> HUBRIS
[3:37:34] <breakingchainz> stepped into the wrong neighborhood
[3:37:36] <%Freakin_Wolfy> Is pat level 200 yet?
[3:37:39] <Finchit> pat needs a copium emote
[3:37:40] <%Valdorick> Yeah, its a trap chest, meant to trick players like you, who know chests have I-frames
[3:37:42] <james_uu> No maidens or i frames
[3:37:45] <+heiro001> uhhhhh
[3:37:46] <+pupil31> YEP
[3:37:46] <Gorgs7> You burned chest I-frames along with the Tree
[3:37:49] <%dekkitout> evanfEGGIUM
[3:37:51] <%twistedj3ster> I'm very impressed
[3:37:57] <depressioncherrie> it's almost exclusively boss fights from here on out
[3:37:57] <dan_g_v> finally, after 200 hours Pat is finally flying through the game! :3
[3:37:58] <+Shishi1205> I mean you are not set to 100% it right then go ahead
[3:37:58] <oda_flobunaga> We'll see
[3:37:58] <%tetraes> Probs beat it tonight
[3:37:59] <mrtanaka111> time for dragon
[3:38:00] <RyuuAoi> Best Pat!
[3:38:00] <%JoshManVGH> Then the game reveals 70% more map
[3:38:00] <%JonathLP> Almost 2/3 of the way done
[3:38:00] <DigiDom> its a coast after melenia
[3:38:01] <%twistedj3ster> and also happy for the amount of content
[3:38:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's taken you longer than 40 minutes tho
[3:38:02] <ape_hawk> pat, the secret boss bugged out on your second attempt
[3:38:02] <TwistParabola> flying through it, he says, nearing the end
[3:38:04] <+Hellarussian> you're only like 100 hours in
[3:38:06] <SomeOtherNeb> maybe it's because it's not a normal chest model
[3:38:07] <Finchit> super copium
[3:38:12] <%JonathLP> Keep it up pat the last 40% is the hardest adn longest
[3:38:13] <+Shishi1205> he's for real btw
[3:38:21] <%SaiyanShoto> You didn't beat it in one day tho
[3:38:26] <Halfsock> it looks like he's swinging a hunting horn
[3:38:29] <deviljhojho_> owned
[3:38:29] <PunkZedB> he also has the coolest armour
[3:38:29] <%JoshManVGH> His hammer is stupid lookin
[3:38:30] <%Cozy90> Pat u still gotta get through the ither half of the game
[3:38:31] <rReizs> maybe different chest models have different properties
[3:38:32] <+Shishi1205> water fowl OP
[3:38:35] <ape_hawk> but bernhal is no match for ANIME
[3:38:35] <NewWillinium> I mean it makes sense that the Ashes of War guy would be strong
[3:38:38] <SomeOtherNeb> Bernahl is tough, but Pat has the power of God and Anime on his side
[3:38:40] <TwistParabola> lets goooooo
[3:38:44] <+HelloImTom08> i like his amor a lot
[3:38:45] <%Valdorick> Read his Armor too
[3:38:47] <+heiro001> hmm
[3:38:49] <%dekkitout> Superbeast Champion
[3:38:54] <james_uu> Boddied
[3:38:57] <dan_g_v> Blasmphemous!
[3:38:58] <mrtanaka111> rykard wins in the end
[3:39:00] <Baeltyr> yo hype
[3:39:02] <+Shishi1205> no
[3:39:03] <+leyk36> item
[3:39:03] <%Kevlar_Caviar> ...wait, a vision of the future?
[3:39:03] <+Smokebanshee> consumable
[3:39:04] <NewWillinium> Usable Item
[3:39:05] <%Valdorick> Its a Consumable
[3:39:06] <WeebFever> it's an item
[3:39:06] <%Valdorick> infact
[3:39:07] <Saturation_Lizard> useable item
[3:39:07] <+Shishi1205> usable
[3:39:09] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt its a tool
[3:39:09] <Finchit> i bet plague hates the waterfowl sword so much
[3:39:09] <Wakerz140> It's a tool
[3:39:09] <TwistParabola> usable
[3:39:11] <stanlychicken> consumable
[3:39:12] <Midnight188> usable item
[3:39:12] <tolloponik> weapon
[3:39:16] <%dekkitout> This game has a Nidhogg? Perfect for the matching giant tree
[3:39:17] <+Aokaay> so basically like jormungandr right
[3:39:19] <mrtanaka111> @Kevlar_Caviar hes immortal
[3:39:20] <SomeOtherNeb> huh.
[3:39:22] <TwistParabola> reusable
[3:39:35] <RubberFistFight> THE GUNPOWDER PLOT
[3:39:38] <+Aokaay> oh right nidhogg is the name i got mixed up
[3:39:40] <GrenYena> Sounds important :)
[3:39:45] <+LandOfTheWay> OH
[3:39:46] <BigBruthaThunda> seems familiar
[3:39:48] <%dekkitout> Another Mal- whatever person
[3:39:50] <+heiro001> so he's Ranni's guy?
[3:39:51] <+Shishi1205> like the amulet in ds1
[3:39:53] <TwistParabola> sounds important
[3:39:54] <ElSuperNova> HMM almost like theres a fight ahead
[3:39:56] <Chaos_Aether> so silver pendant?
[3:39:58] <bluefootedtpeack> sounds liek the silver pendantt
[3:40:00] <tolloponik> is that the abyss thrust?
[3:40:01] <V0LK__> the weapon master set :O
[3:40:03] <+Shishi1205> check his helmet
[3:40:04] <%Deft_Thought> So Ranni was in cahoots with Rykard, eh?
[3:40:04] <%JoshManVGH> Is Paige's microphone on?
[3:40:05] <NewWillinium> @heiro001 Rykard's.
[3:40:07] <deviljhojho_> he couldnt handel the heat
[3:40:09] <Hozak> So there's an item to make that damn fight easier?
[3:40:10] <%watts121> my favorite armor with the cape
[3:40:10] <%AHomeschoolDropout> I think the day they're referring to is the day they assassinated the Elden Lord or whoever
[3:40:11] <%Atomik456> @heiro001 no rykard's
[3:40:13] <%Valdorick> He reached the SAME POINT YOU DID, but then bitched out.
[3:40:14] <%Deft_Thought> Ohhhh
[3:40:15] <%Kevlar_Caviar> BIG PARRY
[3:40:16] <%dekkitout> Manus charm
[3:40:18] <Finchit> ranni gave to rykard who gave it bernhal
[3:40:19] <badhaye> New Armor set nearby
[3:40:19] <roguemephilesclone> Maidenless behaviour.
[3:40:19] <hogbay> that's rough buddy
[3:40:20] <bassoontyphoon> Maidenless
[3:40:20] <+heiro001> got it
[3:40:21] <%Valdorick> After his Maiden died.
[3:40:22] <tolloponik> boo its not a thrust
[3:40:30] <jmft2000> Manus
[3:40:31] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt helmet is neat check it
[3:40:35] <%HiroProtagonest> @Aokaay Nidhogg is the dragon gnawing at the world tree, while Jormungandr is the world serpent
[3:40:37] <Parapattern> What No Maiden does to mf
[3:40:44] <roguemephilesclone> That looked funny.
[3:40:45] <%JonathLP> He just couldn't handle the heartbreak
[3:40:49] <V0LK__> this sword is just absurd
[3:40:52] <TwistParabola> nice
[3:40:59] <badhaye> good talli
[3:41:16] <%Kevlar_Caviar> oh he had 4 heads, not 3
[3:41:20] <roguemephilesclone> YOU LIKE SPELLS, KID?
[3:41:20] <V0LK__> the talisman is the Duseaux dragon :O
[3:41:22] <%cade_calrayn> *smol bork*
[3:41:22] <+Mrbaconator> oh he had FOUR heads
[3:41:22] <badhaye> longer buffs
[3:41:22] <oda_flobunaga> there's another really cool armor set here somewhere,  WITH A DRAGON WING CLOAK
[3:41:22] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> His armor with the cape is some of the best looking armor in the game
[3:41:23] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt so basically Ranni was going to send her bro to help her out but then Rykard got high on that blasphemy shit
[3:41:28] <+Shishi1205> 2 lions
[3:41:28] <mrtanaka111> buttface
[3:41:35] <%twistedj3ster> that's a lot of helmets...
[3:41:36] <+Shishi1205> kissing
[3:41:37] <SomeOtherNeb> <chopped up borks>
[3:41:42] <deviljhojho_> he was the kind of player that didnt explore
[3:41:46] <+heiro001> is this the final grace?
[3:41:53] <senfood> I will calm UP.
[3:41:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> calm up
[3:41:55] <+Shishi1205> no
[3:41:56] <%Valdorick> There will be no calm.
[3:41:58] <dan_g_v> those are good borks
[3:42:00] <BYAKURENLOVER763> no
[3:42:00] <%Valdorick> Only hype.
[3:42:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> NotLikeThis
[3:42:06] <Parapattern> YOU
[3:42:08] <TwistParabola> think so?
[3:42:08] <mrtanaka111> spoiler,sentinel is NOT the boss
[3:42:08] <SocialMisfitGamer> calm go up
[3:42:09] <+Shishi1205> Dragon cult
[3:42:12] <Paperware> There's another armor you missed back there
[3:42:13] <%Cozy90> NICE
[3:42:13] <bassoontyphoon> Kk I’ll pop a Xanax
[3:42:13] <TwistParabola> HIM
[3:42:13] <SomeOtherNeb> to put a nice little bow on it
[3:42:14] <+Grayhammatter> LUL 󠀀
[3:42:15] <%JoshManVGH> Incline
[3:42:16] <tolloponik> don't ask questions, just consume product and get excited for next product
[3:42:18] <%Deft_Thought> LUL
[3:42:20] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt the items you'll get will explain why he's here
[3:42:20] <ElSuperNova> I RETURN
[3:42:22] <roguemephilesclone> I mean, Marika does have an allegiance with the dragons.
[3:42:22] <bluefootedtpeack> divine dragon might,  weakness a slight incline
[3:42:23] <%Valdorick> Why would a Draconic Sentinel be in the dragon zone?
[3:42:24] <TwistParabola> the ANGLE
[3:42:25] <Ethel9727> You can jump in the air and cast Placidusax
[3:42:26] <Finchit> DRAGON sentinel
[3:42:31] <%dmbender> that dragon spell is the definition of hit or miss lol
[3:42:37] <GoogleyGareth> A dragon's worst weakness, slopes
[3:42:38] <+heiro001> dragon horse!
[3:42:40] <+Shishi1205> that horse is for real
[3:42:41] <%JoshManVGH> Eye lasers
[3:42:43] <james_uu> High ground son
[3:42:45] <%twistedj3ster> look out for that horse's mixtape!
[3:42:46] <+pupil31> monkaS
[3:42:47] <+Shishi1205> he is AI trained
[3:42:49] <NewWillinium> This guy fucked up my Int/Dex Sorcerer Build for the longest time. Mainly because of that horse
[3:42:51] <roguemephilesclone> This dude is probably an ambassador. Unlike the Crucible Knight, who is a crazy jerkwad.
[3:42:54] <mrtanaka111> needs more vigor
[3:42:59] <rReizs> fuck this guy and his lingering aoes
[3:43:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> NotLikeThis actually having to fight
[3:43:10] <+Hellarussian> no cheese
[3:43:19] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> GOLD SKELETON
[3:43:21] <ethey16> so many sounds
[3:43:23] <SomeOtherNeb> man my yee-yee ass build has got no chance to beat this shit
[3:43:24] <TwistParabola> yeah
[3:43:24] <ElSuperNova> No scrubery here
[3:43:28] <Parapattern> C'mon AI break!
[3:43:31] <+heiro001> ouch
[3:43:33] <%Niney_Who> Gold Havel is strong
[3:43:33] <%cade_calrayn> don't give up, gold skeleton!
[3:43:34] <%Valdorick> Can't... stop... can't stop the rock
[3:43:36] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Gotta drink
[3:43:39] <TwistParabola> F
[3:43:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh that dude can totally fall off
[3:43:43] <Hozak> This guy is spicy
[3:43:44] <+heiro001> he is gold havel
[3:43:46] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> YA Yum Yum
[3:43:47] <tolloponik> thats soo cool, Lightning Cannon
[3:43:49] <+heiro001> huh
[3:43:53] <IvanMistwalker> Show Boy
[3:43:58] <oda_flobunaga> Very cheesable, using Blood fly swarm
[3:44:00] <+Shishi1205> probably one of the toughest overworld minibosses
[3:44:01] <%JoshManVGH> That shield one sucks but he doesn't seem to do it when your in a tighter radius around him.
[3:44:01] <%Nekros4442> yeah this guy took me the longest to get down other than like the final boss
[3:44:15] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt I found this guy harder than the boss
[3:44:16] <Sunstalker> Man, what if one of these sentinels learned gravity magic like radahn? Fuck our shit up real bad
[3:44:29] <%cade_calrayn> I don't think you can get through the door without him dead?
[3:44:32] <+Shishi1205> @rosabellamelantha for some builds 100%
[3:44:41] <%dekkitout> @Sunstalker And thus, the first DLC enemy was created
[3:44:51] <bluefootedtpeack> @Sunstalker now you mention it i'm suprised each zone didn't ahve their own sentinel type enemy
[3:44:52] <+Shishi1205> @Sunstalker an archer knows gravity
[3:44:53] <DigiDom> this guy was harder than the boss for me
[3:44:55] <%NBUsagi> It started with a Tree Sentinel and ends on a Dragon one
[3:44:56] <+Shishi1205> and the alabaster lords
[3:44:57] <%Valdorick> Havel the Rock appears to be resistant to rocks.
[3:44:57] <$realm_forge> I really want to make his weapon
[3:45:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> not this time
[3:45:03] <+Hellarussian> oh no, hes rock-proof
[3:45:07] <$realm_forge> And shield
[3:45:10] <%VHGS> I didn't bother with this guy on SL1. Running past him to the boss is super free.
[3:45:11] <+Shishi1205> @Sunstalker night dudes are everywhere
[3:45:12] <+pupil31> this guy does more damage than the gods in this game
[3:45:27] <fortheboyzs> THATS SO COOL
[3:45:28] <dan_g_v> is Pat jumping higher than usual?
[3:45:31] <%Nekros4442> dats rad
[3:45:35] <%NBUsagi> Ok the Claw Shield is fuckin beast mode
[3:45:39] <%anoldtoilet> badass
[3:45:39] <Parapattern> I'm surprised he didn't sprout wings
[3:45:48] <+False_Being> cwispy
[3:45:49] <%Niney_Who> Can't STOP THE ROCK
[3:45:49] <%cade_calrayn> @dan_g_v I think it's the angle of the incline
[3:46:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> it is being done
[3:46:10] <bleugh> he has to do "it"
[3:46:15] <%Nekros4442> rykard's sword carried me through this one.
[3:46:20] <SocialMisfitGamer> ketchup!?
[3:46:21] <bassoontyphoon> WHO SAID THAT??!?
[3:46:22] <%Deadpal> I need ketchup too
[3:46:31] <ElSuperNova> A true maiden
[3:46:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> gotta counteract the mustard

[3:46:37] <%watts121> SHE'S CHEATING ON MUSTARD?!?!?
[3:46:37] <%Felhad> Don't we all just need some ketchup
[3:46:38] <+TDotGoat> everyone needs ketchup sometimes
[3:46:39] <RyuuAoi> She's cheating on mustard!?
[3:47:11] <%Cozy90> This guy might as well be a boss fight lol
[3:47:13] <+RedMaskBandit> code for sex? I too also need some ketchup.
[3:47:16] <RyuuAoi> Ranch
[3:47:25] <%dmbender> this dude hits so hard omg

[3:47:34] <$stub_master> Don't get greedy, skeleton!
[3:47:35] <bluefootedtpeack> imagine fighting this guy in a shallow pool of water
[3:47:47] <djblue_shift> why does that axe look like the kushala hammer lol
[3:48:08] <PunkZedB> this guy was harder than the boss he was protecting for me

[3:48:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> I get caught by that shit every single time, I never learn
[3:48:46] <%Monkeyweed21> didnt know Pat was Gon's dad with that Greed Island
[3:48:53] <%Nekros4442> I timed the roll yo when his shield starts moving down when he calls lightning on your head. Then i rolled towards him
[3:48:57] <%SaiyanShoto> I want a horse that can shoot fireballs
[3:48:58] <%Felhad> Advanced dog tech
[3:49:08] <%razz_zie> Pat why is Gief so piggy and cute?
[3:49:13] <bassoontyphoon> Pat putting David Carradine to shame with his choking skills
[3:49:16] <%TheGuesty> Buff flasks description is basically this next boss's ball sweat you are drinking
[3:49:39] <%Felhad> Because hes so fat and stinky
[3:49:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> He gits it from his father @razz_zie
[3:49:48] <%razz_zie> psaGiefstare
[3:49:54] <SIydoc> just got here, has pat fought the optional boss of this zone yet?
[3:50:03] <%Felhad> yup
[3:50:08] <Vyskus> aw man, I left for food, did pat finish giddora
[3:50:11] <NewWillinium> @SIydoc Yep beat him a few minutes ago
[3:50:19] <+pupil31> damn
[3:50:19] <1dennis> the dodge button
[3:50:20] <TwistParabola> dunno
[3:50:21] <%dmbender> @Vyskus yuup
[3:50:23] <%Felhad> AI bugged at the end, ez win
[3:50:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> simply do not get hit Kappa
[3:50:26] <NewWillinium> Mainly by Dodging to the side just before he pumps his shield
[3:50:29] <Sunstalker> I think just run in one direction without stopping?
[3:50:30] <thegingeinthenorth> zangief got this
[3:50:31] <Midnight188> count it out and then roll before it hits u?
[3:50:33] <Vyskus> damn
[3:50:34] <Solidus_113> watch when he pumps his shield
[3:50:34] <%MrMegaJackpots> when he does the fist pum
[3:50:37] <+leyk36> @PatStaresAt If you dodge right when he pumps his arm down, you can dodge it
[3:50:40] <+Rofiarf> just give him the controller
[3:50:42] <$sassyquatch963> i really like the design of maving a customizable buff flask, i think its an elegant alternative to having a million consumables
[3:50:43] <RyuuAoi> AWWWEEE GIEF
[3:50:43] <%SaiyanShoto> Drool on the controller Gief
[3:50:44] <%MrMegaJackpots> *fist pump
[3:50:45] <bluefootedtpeack> when he does his lightning buff is that a big enough opening for rot breath?
[3:50:48] <LMTTN> Is your weapon not optimal/upgraded all the way or does is this guy just that spongy
[3:50:50] <Oxybe> BIGGEST and STRONGEST help.

[3:51:04] <%Mister_McDerp> father son team up
[3:51:04] <%Atomik456> honestly i never figured out how to dodge that so i just stayed right in his business during the electro phase so yhe didnt use the shield lightning

[4:04:36] <+GrateMan> Leave out some garlic and he'll eat it then he'll die!
[4:04:38] <%Maids4lyfe> @Fenrisulfr_V is he harder with co-op?
[4:04:42] <%Freakin_Wolfy> Does Pat know that the capital is irreversibly changed after this fight?

[4:05:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> shoulda just mixed some chocolate in with all the Death you fed him

[4:07:24] <+Con_fusedDX> hell yeah
[4:07:24] <boostergoldz> it reduces max hp
[4:07:25] <+Shishi1205> no
[4:07:25] <Wakerz140> Yeah
[4:07:25] <%JonathLP> I mean, his disguise was beast clergyman
[4:07:26] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Faith colossal sword
[4:07:26] <%Kevlar_Caviar> it's rad
[4:07:26] <ohno58> yeah
[4:07:27] <Solidus_113> it goes in the shop
[4:07:27] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt that third hit there could have been parried with the item for example and he would have been open, that said I find the dodge MUCH easier to do than the parry
[4:07:27] <%DEETRz> of course
[4:07:28] <oda_flobunaga> yes
[4:07:28] <+Shishi1205> wait yes
[4:07:29] <NewWillinium> You absolutely get his armor
[4:07:29] <TwistParabola> YES
[4:07:29] <%JonathLP> yes you get his armor
[4:07:31] <doster504> yes
[4:07:31] <$EsotericOdyssey> yeyeye
[4:07:31] <+Shishi1205> you buy it
[4:07:32] <djblue_shift> faith gets some cool greatswords in the end
[4:07:32] <rosabellamelantha> yes
[4:07:34] <%AHomeschoolDropout> his armor is literally just Berserker armor
[4:07:35] <Evendrag> you do
[4:07:36] <luciluxlu0> gotta buy it
[4:07:36] <%EldritchBee> @Komayeda Malenia's
[4:07:38] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I prefer the other Remembrance item from him, but the sword's alright.
[4:07:39] <CasualHardcoreTheater> Yup
[4:07:39] <cavefishes> @Komayeda malenia's katana
[4:07:41] <+Con_fusedDX> his armor is sick
[4:07:41] <BigFingerRo> @BigFingerRo When has that ever stopped anything in this series?
[4:07:43] <+Shishi1205> you have to buy it from the ladt
[4:07:46] <Komayeda> ooh
[4:07:47] <%Valdorick> He has 2 Faith Swords, funny enough. Worth it to copy his boss soul.
[4:07:50] <Komayeda> looks cool
[4:08:00] <$sassyquatch963> i feel like most of the boss weapons are faith based, probably because killing gods is the main quest
[4:08:02] <Komayeda> I think I'm gonna try usin more boss weapons next playthrough
[4:08:03] <boostergoldz> the incant sucks tho
[4:08:13] <CasualHardcoreTheater> Def copy his soul. Totally worth it
[4:08:15] <+Jeshk0> you got this greg!

[4:08:56] <+Jeshk0> oof
[4:08:59] <%twistedj3ster> Pat, would you say some bosses are simply built for summoning/MP?
[4:09:00] <%anoldtoilet> he can do flying slashes like one piece characters
[4:09:01] <TwistParabola> Cower. Before Maliketh, Marika's Black Blade.
[4:09:01] <Komayeda> Yeah, I went with a Strength and Strength Alone build, and I was only really able to use the Golden Halberd
[4:09:02] <%dmbender> 2 FAST 2 QUIK

[4:09:10] <seaechiowai> wait is Pat losing weight?
[4:09:10] <Midnight188> "what if Sif was Artorias lol"
[4:09:11] <NaberiustheNefarious> what level is your mimic tear?
[4:09:11] <%vexion_smh> godamn that hurts
[4:09:12] <Akett> Artorias with both arms.
[4:09:12] <+Shishi1205> liontorias
[4:09:13] <Evendrag> big gattsu
[4:09:15] <mrtanaka111> maliketh,blade of geif
[4:09:16] <%Valdorick> Note - he has the lowest HP of the  last 5 bosses... but he's a fuck'n dodge tank.
[4:09:17] <%GingaNZ> so do you only parry the blade, or also the projectiles?
[4:09:17] <Mitchellsocks> Barktorias
[4:09:18] <BigFingerRo> this dude fucks strongly , goddamn!
[4:09:23] <%dekkitout> Can you spam that trinket or is it not like with Manus
[4:09:27] <doster504> artorias is a slow ass punk
[4:09:28] <knotsundownsyndrome> maliketh feels like a main character
[4:09:28] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt yeah the parry is REALLY hard to pull off but it does work super well
[4:09:28] <Evendrag> beat it again
[4:09:30] <%Cozy90> u gonna show ur butt on stream?
[4:09:31] <BigFingerRo> are you gonna rq?
[4:09:31] <$EsotericOdyssey> NGL the Bloodhound Step ash carried me in his fight
[4:09:32] <$realm_forge> Artoridog
[4:09:34] <Chaos_Aether> crazy you say

[4:09:37] <jubejube56> Bot I thought sif was dogtorias :(
[4:09:41] <ape_hawk> can tiche do better than mimic?
[4:09:41] <%TheGuesty> do something crazy = pull a Plague and kill all NPCs?
[4:09:43] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt "something crazy" NG+?
[4:09:43] <+Smokebanshee> Falls on his ass
[4:09:44] <youngin_______420> @Mitchellsocks lmaoo
[4:09:45] <Ashenik1> Did Pat fight HER?
[4:09:46] <Blank9> the crazy thing: play strangers of paradise
[4:09:51] <Saturation_Lizard> its an interrupt but not a counter
[4:09:53] <Fabpsi_> something crazy afterwards? Like...playing demons souls to see how far they have come?
[4:09:53] <%Brassnarwhal> ARTORIAS WAS ALREADY DOG AFILLIATED
[4:09:54] <$realm_forge> Ewww pats gonna beat it on stream
[4:09:57] <%Valdorick> Oh, if you die to a Black Fire attack, it bleeds you when you rez, stupidly.
[4:10:01] <+Javaa01> It's a damage reflect and knockdown
[4:10:04] <Midnight188> @Ashenik1 Malenia? Yes. He beat her.
[4:10:07] <+SaintSalted> for some reason if u die while flamed up you respawn damages
[4:10:09] <+Shishi1205> there's some strange jank with talismans and starting with less hp
[4:10:11] <Evendrag> did he do dragonlord?
[4:10:14] <boostergoldz> the sword he uses reduces max hp so when you come back that gets fixed but you're not restored to full
[4:10:19] <Ashenik1> @Midnight188  how many hours?
[4:10:21] <RustyQuarters> Is Zangief Dogshmough or Dogough?
[4:10:24] <+GrateMan> I like how you can get a bit of his moveset from the early phase.
[4:10:25] <%Valdorick> He did do Dragon Lord
[4:10:25] <%GingaNZ> lol the rocks were coming
[4:10:26] <breakingchainz> Fromsoft mastered the art of too cool
[4:10:33] <Midnight188> @Ashenik1 took like 30 tries but he got her
[4:10:34] <Evendrag> ty
[4:10:38] <%vexion_smh> half PogChamp
[4:10:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> get parried
[4:10:51] <+Shishi1205> imagine the mimic doing the parry
[4:10:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> LUL
[4:10:56] <%Valdorick> Mimic-chan just eating shit
[4:10:59] <%EldritchBee> Don't even bother with it pat just dont get hit
[4:11:00] <Sunstalker> How high is Pat's stamina here?
[4:11:01] <akitanito> what the fuck
[4:11:05] <Ashenik1> @Midnight188  not bad
[4:11:05] <+Javaa01> Only the golden attacks
[4:11:08] <$EsotericOdyssey> gotta get the timing
[4:11:11] <$EsotericOdyssey> it's really hard
[4:11:11] <DuckAlfred> it parries the gold strikes
[4:11:14] <SomeOtherNeb> who put all this anime in my bloodborne
[4:11:18] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt that wasn't a golden attack
[4:11:19] <BigFingerRo> HOLY FUCK JUDGEMENT CUT END
[4:11:22] <%twistedj3ster> no it was blue
[4:11:23] <%Niney_Who> no
[4:11:24] <tolloponik> wow he HATES Greg
[4:11:28] <Saturation_Lizard> the double spin moves are the only thing you can reliably parry, its not worth using honestly
[4:11:30] <digaogrunge> RED IS GOLD
[4:11:34] <%GingaNZ> when his sword glows gold
[4:11:35] <+Smokebanshee> You can honestly ignore it
[4:11:35] <%Niney_Who> TYHAT was gold
[4:11:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> but some of them are golder
[4:11:37] <$sassyquatch963> fun fact: you can avoid the life-drain by not getting hit
[4:11:41] <Komayeda> YOU CAN DO THIS PAT!

[4:16:10] <rosabellamelantha> Dead
[4:16:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> how does it feel to be a hero/
[4:16:13] <Sunstalker> GURRANQ WAS JUST LIKE BLAIDD?
[4:16:14] <%cade_calrayn> Malekith was like Blaidd, but cooler
[4:16:15] <breakingchainz> that greatsword is amazing
[4:16:19] <deviljhojho_> strength and faith
[4:16:28] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt He was Marika's Blaidd
[4:16:28] <+Akizea> they're both REALLY good
[4:16:29] <TheBlankAce> You want both of these
[4:16:31] <%kewlmyc> Can you choose not to burn the tree, or is the only choices during the actual ending?
[4:16:35] <BigFingerRo> BLLLLACK BLADE, too bad we got it a month late
[4:16:37] <+orochiblood> should dupe
[4:16:38] <SomeOtherNeb> try spinning, it's a good trick
[4:16:40] <%NBUsagi> So Malekith was who they stole the Death Runes from
[4:16:40] <%Valdorick> That thing has INSANE range
[4:16:41] <TwistParabola> both are real good
[4:16:45] <%EldritchBee> @kewlmyc You HAVE to burn it
[4:16:46] <ElSuperNova> @kewlmyc Actual ending
[4:16:48] <WeebFever> buy his rad armor
[4:16:49] <cavefishes> burning the tree is required
[4:16:49] <RubberFistFight> @cade_calrayn that's a tall order, Blaidd was pretty damn cool.
[4:16:50] <Wakerz140> @PatStaresAt Don't forget to buy the armor
[4:16:53] <Hozak> Black blade. forged a billion years ago Blade BLADE!
[4:16:58] <%dekkitout> Hot damn that faith req

[4:17:11] <CasualHardcoreTheater> Time for the copy pasta turtles
[4:17:12] <%GingaNZ> memory deleted
[4:17:12] <Darkrenai> Armour already out of his brain
[4:17:13] <ElSuperNova> The incant kinda sucks
[4:17:13] <+ScrapKingKeita> cry about it
[4:17:14] <RubberFistFight> Burning the tree is required - what's up to you is whether you use the frenzied flame for it, or whether you get melina to do it.
[4:17:15] <+Grayhammatter> nothing
[4:17:16] <RustyQuarters> cry a lil
[4:17:16] <%Valdorick> Oh, look at the tree now

[4:17:28] <%Cozy90> creepy49Cry creepy49Cry
[4:17:29] <%SaiyanShoto> Gonna cum?
[4:17:32] <%NBUsagi> It seems like there is something inherently wrong with the Erdtree as it is, so no matter what ending you get you have to burn the old one to make a new one? or atleast purge it of what ever is wrong with it?
[4:17:33] <seaechiowai> I guess I'll play with pp
[4:17:35] <kingra> I'm gonna shit LIVE onstream
[4:17:35] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Check the beast sanctum as well.
[4:17:37] <%vexion_smh> cry about it
[4:17:37] <%cade_calrayn> Buy the armor or you're pussy no balls, Pat
[4:17:38] <%barrakuta371> I'll cry a little bit
[4:17:39] <%Brassnarwhal> thus ends the age of dragons, long may the fire reign

[4:18:03] <mrtanaka111> liar wall
[4:18:04] <SQDizzy> he was already gone
[4:18:05] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> weird, i thought they were separate
[4:18:07] <+Shishi1205> shit
[4:18:08] <Evendrag> he was there for me lmao
[4:18:09] <%twistedj3ster> What happes when you try to kick his ass there?
[4:18:11] <WeebFever> if you kill maliketh before gurranq, he's still there
[4:18:12] <bassoontyphoon> Da bany
[4:18:12] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt  he would still be there if you hadn't given him all the deathroot, though, it's odd
[4:18:14] <bluefootedtpeack> i like how he's a mix of some of thor's main villains,  named malekith,  looks like the fenrir wolf, wields a black blade that kills gods like gorr the god butcher.
[4:18:14] <Paperware> if you don't complete the quest, he's still there
[4:18:15] <BigFingerRo> Hey Pat, how old is Gief again?
[4:18:15] <SQDizzy> i killed Maliketh and Gurraq was still there
[4:18:15] <SomeOtherNeb> bo-
[4:18:16] <+suicidallobo> must be because i didnt do all the deathroots
[4:18:18] <%Brassnarwhal> bye gurranq
[4:18:18] <+dilltacular> what? hes still here in my play through
[4:18:19] <IvanMistwalker> talk to the NPC?
[4:18:19] <+Shishi1205> I had one deathroot to give him
[4:18:24] <doster504> he's still around if you don't give him all of his chow
[4:18:26] <breakingchainz> woahhhhh in my playthrough hes still there???
[4:18:28] <+brandonsbetow> pc has a bug rn that I can't use one of those belfry and I can't activate the towers I have yet to use
[4:18:29] <+Hellarussian> pretty rad
[4:18:29] <purple9z> he's still there if you haven't finished the questline for him
[4:18:29] <Darkrenai> His armour is actually super sick
[4:18:30] <%Niney_Who> LOOK AT THAT GUTS SHIT
[4:18:34] <RustyQuarters> MAN MALIKETH WAS THE BEST

[4:18:40] <%dekkitout> Black and gold Skeleton
[4:18:41] <+mikeygrd> wierd he was there for me too
[4:18:42] <%Brassnarwhal> @cade_calrayn makes sense, it's probably to allow you to finish his quest
[4:18:44] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Too Bad its light
[4:18:45] <deviljhojho_> now this is a real ass set
[4:18:46] <@DakotaMacDoodle> coolest armor

[4:24:54] <+Aokaay> im assuming its a bug everyone got but it'd be funny if it was intentional
[4:25:02] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You can get erdtrees favor +2 if you go to the east side lake of the capitol
[4:25:03] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> SOMEONE PUT THIS LORE ON THE WIKI
[4:25:06] <%Valdorick> Oh right, that's a high faith req incantation.
[4:25:09] <amishincognito> i haven't watched since your third day of streaming whats all the lore
[4:25:17] <%dekkitout> @BeatBoxersDevMike ESSENTIAL LORE
[4:25:21] <leole11> thank you pat, for beating the game when i can stay up all night watching it

[4:25:43] <%Niney_Who> Yeah that's the meaty Greatsword moveset
[4:25:45] <$sassyquatch963> return of the paladin
[4:25:47] <+BlandSpice> It's sword art is nuts
[4:25:48] <cavefishes> is the L2 cool
[4:25:49] <%Felhad> It's a good sword
[4:25:50] <TwistParabola> try the L2?
[4:25:56] <jubejube56> Y'know as a reward for collecting all the dragon breathes they shoulda given you a special breath where you do all at once
[4:26:00] <RubberFistFight> ok so the roundtable hold HAS to be metaphysically linked to the version of it we found in the capital, since burning that area causes the hold to burn too
[4:26:04] <Sunstalker> You have aqcuired the POOPKNIFE
[4:26:05] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Do you have a second UGS that isn't the Godslayer one?
[4:26:11] <%Valdorick> 50 faith, 50 strength, 0 vigor Kappa
[4:26:14] <RubberFistFight> which wouldn't make sense unless they were linked, since it's way off on the corner of the map there
[4:26:20] <Sigma_190_Beta> @RubberFistFight It's inside the Erdtree.
[4:26:22] <%Niney_Who> Just the normal Greatsword yeah?
[4:26:24] <Sunstalker> Godslayer isn't UGS?
[4:26:25] <senfood> @jubejube56 That's stupid. I love it.
[4:26:27] <digaogrunge> Get the regular greatsword and put some holy on that for duals wielding
[4:26:27] <bleugh> elmo silently observing is hilarious to me
[4:26:28] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat, put on the laws of regression incantation you have and use it next to a Marika statue in the Capitol. I don't know if you can still do it in this state, but it reveals a huge secret
[4:26:29] <Sigma_190_Beta> Probably.
[4:26:29] <sirrice77> i mean theres the regular guts greatsword

[4:31:33] <Hozak> Gotta get to the lands before time
[4:31:35] <Sigma_190_Beta> Actually, that's probably fine.

[4:31:45] <Shockmaster182> Lucky Ted, do it coward
[4:31:50] <%MaybeFalco> are you ready to get a boat and sail to sokoon island pat
[4:31:55] <RubberFistFight> @EldritchBee followed closely by "Those Lands Over There"
[4:31:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> time to grind a bunch to get the good numbers
[4:31:57] <%Valdorick> Now test that weapon art and incantation!
[4:31:58] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Crazy how the only bosses that are REQUIRED to beat the game are the last 4-5 really.
[4:31:59] <leole11> i'm sure 35 vig won't backfire
[4:32:01] <%watts121> hol up...was it at 500 damage...WHILE NOT REACHING THE REQUIREMENTS??!?!!
[4:32:04] <vile_brand> but it's not 60 pat
[4:32:10] <digaogrunge> 906
[4:32:10] <Paperware> 54 or 53 is best since you hit str cap by 2 handing
[4:32:10] <+SaintSalted> 12 dex hggPeanut
[4:32:14] <%anoldtoilet> 35 is shitloads of vigor
[4:32:16] <jubejube56> Lol that poor intelligence stat
[4:32:20] <Sunstalker> @RubberFistFight Why are you all forgetting about the Land Down Under?
[4:32:25] <+Jeshk0> happy (re)birthday!
[4:32:33] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> the unga lord
[4:32:36] <MusouMiko> not very smart and not very fast or nimble
[4:32:42] <%Valdorick> ITS A COOL SPELL
[4:32:42] <%SaiyanShoto> Who needs smart when you can hit hard
[4:32:42] <mrtanaka111> not bad
[4:32:43] <RubberFistFight> @Sunstalker shoosh, you'll spoil it!
[4:32:44] <SomeOtherNeb> oh
[4:32:45] <%NBUsagi> Thats metal as fuck
[4:32:45] <Evendrag> did u juice the sword too?
[4:32:46] <oda_flobunaga> that's okay we like you anyway
[4:32:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> cool
[4:32:48] <%anoldtoilet> lol
[4:32:48] <%Valdorick> It goes through targets too
[4:32:48] <cavefishes> 35 is not shitloads, you can go up to like 58 and 40-50 is still around 25 health per level
[4:32:49] <%baka_sugoi> sp00nREE
[4:32:50] <+bromontana> yeaaah that blade is sick
[4:32:50] <%Niney_Who> Remember it has a followup
[4:32:51] <insomniac_doze_> thats anime
[4:32:51] <+Smokebanshee> has a followup
[4:32:51] <%dekkitout> Greg is gonna LOVE that
[4:32:51] <Shockmaster182> You’re guts
[4:32:51] <MusouMiko> you get a followup to it too
[4:32:57] <Augus7717> STR can go above cap in Elden ring when you two hand stuff @Paperware
[4:32:58] <cavefishes> COOL
[4:32:58] <leole11> it has a follow up
[4:33:03] <%watts121> Would be better if it peirced
[4:33:04] <digaogrunge> do the follow up
[4:33:13] <cheesedburgers> STR mimic tear is like. Not fair
[4:33:17] <thebestesttrashpanda> @Augus7717 ...wait whaty
[4:33:20] <Sigma_190_Beta> Do the Follow up/
[4:33:24] <%watts121> Maliketh's weapon art is not that good IMO
[4:33:26] <%twistedj3ster> this looks like the Berserk Musuo now
[4:33:33] <%Valdorick> @watts121 The incantation? It does peirce.
[4:33:38] <doster504> he had perfect spacing lmao
[4:33:44] <%JoshManVGH> The spell has a followup!?
[4:33:45] <BigFingerRo> this seems a tad unwieldy
[4:33:48] <+SaintSalted> do the roar hggMuffin
[4:33:49] <%Cozy90> rules of nature?
[4:33:57] <%Valdorick> Oh yeah, the spell can be double cast
[4:34:00] <%notsoy> not the spell, the weapon art does tho
[4:34:01] <Shockmaster182> Jesus Christ they do like no damage
[4:34:02] <Augus7717> you can have 99 STR and still get more damage out of it if you two hand weapons @thebestesttrashpanda
[4:34:02] <BigFingerRo> So, is the game done now?
[4:34:12] <cavefishes> yeah the spell has a 2 part combo
[4:34:14] <Lulu19> blasphemous sword still has the best faith sword weapon art
[4:34:16] <Sunstalker> @cheesedburgers Try Bleed Mimic with a good weapon art.
[4:34:20] <+seaearthandsky> wat

[4:34:31] <17sevens> @BigFingerRo finale still incoming
[4:34:32] <seaechiowai> I swear that exact animation is in Armored Core
[4:34:32] <Ghufufin> max health reduction?
[4:34:34] <jubejube56> reduces max hp and dot
[4:34:34] <bluefootedtpeack> it reduces their max hp percentage wise doesn't it
[4:34:37] <MusouMiko> also debuffs th eir max hp
[4:34:37] <Lulu19> until you get THAT sword
[4:34:39] <sendart> Percentage based
[4:34:40] <Sigma_190_Beta> Lowers Max HP as well remember? @PatStaresAt
[4:34:43] <Gorgs7> does it bleed too?
[4:34:46] <HeroToxiko> BLOODFLAME BAYBEEEE
[4:34:47] <Solidus_113> dank destined death
[4:34:48] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat the tooltip says something about reducing max hp
[4:34:48] <CasualHardcoreTheater> Mega bleed and life reduction
[4:34:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> ahh
[4:34:49] <%abakkus> mirakuruFluh
[4:34:55] <RubberFistFight> don';t we all., Pat
[4:34:56] <TwistParabola> MORE?
[4:34:58] <SomeOtherNeb> oh no he's gone crazy with power
[4:35:02] <+vaderxyz1970> Mommy put me back in I need more Mind
[4:35:02] <Shockmaster182> The pat swordsman
[4:35:02] <%dekkitout> Expand the noodle
[4:35:03] <+seaearthandsky> so I guess the second hit is just stupid?
[4:35:05] <+Funky_Honkey> use reduce FP cost talisman
[4:35:07] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> how many respecs left?
[4:35:09] <%watts121> the life reduction stacks I think
[4:35:10] <Ghufufin> screw real death sword, we need more death magic sword
[4:35:16] <HeroToxiko> Bloodflame is great on its own, i use it with the revengers halberd
[4:35:20] <%livi242> I almost used all my of respecs before NG+ lol
[4:35:27] <cheesedburgers> Don’t ever stop respeccing
[4:35:28] <+Drigoooooo> yeah you dont need that much END
[4:35:50] <+Funky_Honkey> you're not that heavy
[4:35:51] <%EldritchBee> Legit the starting End is fine
[4:35:51] <+AyupaPupa> ew math?
[4:35:54] <@QueequegTheater> 30
[4:35:54] <%Felhad> math
[4:35:55] <+Jeshk0> oh no! math
[4:35:58] <knotsundownsyndrome> i don't know what that is
[4:36:00] <%baka_sugoi> Ew MAFF
[4:36:04] <Ner234> MAth DansGame
[4:36:06] <MusouMiko> you need 107 equip load
[4:36:09] <Baeltyr> hey the math isnt really that hard
[4:36:12] <jubejube56> You can't math with an Int of 9
[4:36:13] <Shockmaster182> 🤮
[4:36:13] <Solidus_113> stamina good
[4:36:16] <Baeltyr> im gonna say its like 32 33
[4:36:17] <MusouMiko> but rebirth doesn't factor in talismans, so its a pain
[4:36:19] <%SaiyanShoto> I don't want to do homework while playing my game!
[4:36:20] <Gorgs7> your equip load is a perfect 75, so don't you only need exactly 100 equip load?
[4:36:28] <Saturation_Lizard> @PatStaresAt you could only afford to sacrifice a point at most for equip load, not worth it
[4:36:31] <%Valdorick> 53 is the cap for 2 handing, isn't it?
[4:36:32] <Omenaire_> why not a little more endurance
[4:36:42] <MusouMiko> @Gorgs7 its 70% not 75%
[4:36:48] <MusouMiko> so its 107.1
[4:37:18] <bluefootedtpeack> could switch to godrick's rune for the boost from that, but it's only when you have a rune
[4:37:20] <%Valdorick> PERFECT
[4:37:23] <+Drigoooooo> thats good
[4:37:30] <cavefishes> perfecto
[4:37:38] <%Valdorick> Hey wait, is Blackblade a Beast incantation?
[4:37:49] <%dmbender> So funfact with the Larval Tears, if you co-op and kill the npcs that drop them, they will drop for the co-op player too, so you can get more once you run out in your world
[4:37:58] <+bromontana> What great rune does he run?
[4:37:58] <+Jeshk0> happy (re(re))birthday!

[4:38:42] <$EsotericOdyssey> jesus fuck
[4:38:49] <NewWillinium> I appreciate how different almost every Area looks because of the Erdtree being burnt
[4:38:52] <seaechiowai> That's pretty poggers
[4:38:53] <+heiro001> living the dream
[4:38:53] <%dekkitout> Tiche is gonna lose her marbles next time you summon her Kappa
[4:38:54] <%abakkus> psaSun

[4:39:13] <GrenYena> CoolCat DESTINED DEATH CoolCat
[4:39:15] <%kewlmyc> @PatStaresAt Is the Grapes chick quest still bugged for you due to the invader not showing up?
[4:39:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> christ
[4:39:20] <%Valdorick> They have an EVEN FANCIER tool
[4:39:23] <%Valdorick> even later
[4:39:27] <+Drigoooooo> there is still more faith tools
[4:39:27] <%sniffy77> Pat I just got INT up enough to use comet azul. my mimic is shoopdawooping everything omg
[4:39:28] <NewWillinium> Faith gets all of the Fancy tools though.
[4:39:29] <+Mcardy93> What does your armour look like altered??
[4:39:29] <+zaddyforever> i just got in, which weapon even is this
[4:39:30] <fortheboyzs> reminds me of jetstream sam
[4:39:31] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> anyone know if arcane (luck) gets a wep?
[4:39:32] <V0LK__> faith is no longer a joke in souls game :D
[4:39:32] <Saturation_Lizard> faith gets PLENTY of fancy weapons
[4:39:35] <cavefishes> bro the final boss faith tool tho
[4:39:40] <+vaderxyz1970> it's as if you need some FAITH that it would get better
[4:39:44] <+ScrapKingKeita> how's turtle pope doing
[4:39:47] <%SaiyanShoto> They want you to have faith that you'll get good stuff psaGotcha
[4:39:52] <RubberFistFight> it's permafucked
[4:39:53] <vile_brand> @PatStaresAt you gonna kill everyone?
[4:39:55] <Evendrag> Ask if she has any Glue
[4:39:55] <%kewlmyc> Fuck, you too huh?
[4:39:58] <%watts121> wait...she doesn't show up at Inhibition
[4:39:59] <%Felhad> lolwut, Faith has shit forever
[4:40:02] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> we need to know if tutle pope is OK
[4:40:04] <SomeOtherNeb> @SaiyanShoto boooooooo
[4:40:04] <Shockmaster182> Now you are become elron ring
[4:40:06] <%watts121> or is Vyke not showing up?
[4:40:09] <cavefishes> and the buffs stack too, you can use sacred vow and flame give me strength at the same time
[4:40:10] <RubberFistFight> i guess try and do it early next time or something? shame that it's so easily busted.
[4:40:12] <%EldritchBee> Did pat do the Ever Brilliant Goldmask's quest?
[4:40:17] <%kewlmyc> @watts121 The invader you need for her side quest does though
[4:40:23] <%Willowight> only god, nobody important
[4:40:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> everyone is gonna die anyway now, death got turned on
[4:40:25] <Shockmaster182> Ayyyyy Elmo
[4:40:26] <TwistParabola> yeah he should be nearby
[4:40:27] <sendart> You gonna bother doing Sellen quest?
[4:40:27] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt when you get back into the city go to the arena instead of going up since you did Goldmask's quest
[4:40:29] <%kewlmyc> Unless he doesn't, which is the bug here
[4:40:35] <leole11> i'm sure everything's fine near the tree
[4:40:36] <NewWillinium> So I do know that Gold Mask is *somewhere* around him, but I never found him because I fucked up their quest.
[4:40:37] <%dekkitout> Aw lord he runnin
[4:40:38] <%abakkus> pubby skitters
[4:40:38] <Midnight188> looks like Vyke will invade as long as you are NOT doing Hyetta's quest. somehow ignoring every other possible storyline and just beelining there he'll spawn every time.
[4:40:44] <%watts121> @kewlmyc damn Vyke drops an OP spear too
[4:40:45] <NewWillinium> Here not him. Not the first him
[4:40:46] <Shockmaster182> My roommate just a cat and I understand the appeal now
[4:40:54] <mrtanaka111> did pat use the needle?
[4:40:58] <$EsotericOdyssey> NG+ is fun so farr
[4:41:05] <+zaddyforever> @midnight188 that’s weird, i got vyke while doing the quest
[4:41:08] <$EsotericOdyssey> enjoying being able to turn enemies' assholes inside-out
[4:41:10] <+rbakervv> my alexa just said she doesn't get hungry, somehow pat activated it
[4:41:13] <seaechiowai> @Shockmaster182 your room mate did??
[4:41:16] <%abakkus> @mrtanaka111 pat never did the thing that would require the needle to fix
[4:41:17] <RubberFistFight> @watts121 Vyke has been broken and not spawning for a lot of people. Me included. He never spawned for Pat, not even once. For me he spawned a handful of times then stopped. A lot of people can't get Edgar to spawn either, and nobody seems to know what causes either of them to stop appearing,.
[4:41:18] <leole11> @EsotericOdyssey is there any new encounters like DS2 in NG+?
[4:41:21] <%Felhad> @newwillinium Goldmask is near the colosseum
[4:41:21] <Midnight188> @mrtanaka111 no he did not. he saw no need, as he's not Lord of Frenzied Flame.
[4:41:24] <%watts121> @Midnight188 I went to Vyke after giving her the first grape, he showed up for me.
[4:41:25] <mrtanaka111> NG+ has new npcs
[4:41:33] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Crazy that the
[4:41:38] <SomeOtherNeb> SourPls
[4:41:42] <$EsotericOdyssey> @EsotericOdyssey not that I've encountered so far
[4:41:46] <$EsotericOdyssey> might be hard to tell
[4:41:55] <$EsotericOdyssey> just on account of how much shit is in the game in general
[4:41:57] <cavefishes> @mrtanaka111 where? i haven't seen any new NPCs
[4:41:58] <IvanMistwalker> NG+ HAS NEW NPC?
[4:42:02] <+Drigoooooo> I hope pat gets power bombed by you know who
[4:42:04] <Midnight188> @watts121 bizarre because I only ever got him to spawn on a fresh character with nothing else done. he seems extremely fragile and breaks easily.
[4:42:07] <RubberFistFight> @watts121 "works fine for me!" great, very helpful.
[4:42:09] <knotsundownsyndrome> i can't read
[4:42:14] <cavefishes> no i don't think it does
[4:42:16] <Midnight188> do the wrong quest and his flag is forever turned off.
[4:42:21] <%Felhad> NG+ doesnt have anything new, it just scales difficulty, thats all
[4:42:21] <NewWillinium> @Felhad . . How do you get there from the Ashen Citadel? Is it after the next boss fight?
[4:42:22] <%sniffy77> OKAY THAT DEATH STATUS ARMOR IS BULLSHIT
[4:42:24] <cavefishes> it doesn't even have new talismans or anything
[4:42:29] <%anoldtoilet> @watts121 no need to be rude.
[4:42:30] <leole11> i got both edgar and vyke, but edgar took some finessing
[4:42:59] <%Felhad> @newwillinium he's basically right under the cliff where he initially was in the capital
[4:43:08] <leole11> i literally finished the game yesterday and started a new playthrough lmao
[4:43:10] <+zaddyforever> it’s real weird not knowing what’s intended and what’s a glitch with the npcs
[4:43:26] <NewWillinium> @Felhad Ohhh
[4:43:29] <RubberFistFight> @watts121 w/e lol
[4:43:29] <%watts121> @anoldtoilet didn't know it was rude to say what happened in my game...
[4:43:35] <+InhumanMilitia> pat did you get the full map?
[4:43:36] <+bromontana> oh no its wipe-o-clock
[4:43:39] <mrtanaka111> son?
[4:43:46] <%NBUsagi> Look at this adorable baby
[4:43:48] <SomeOtherNeb> "groink", says Zangief
[4:43:51] <%abakkus> burgers time
[4:43:58] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Erdtrees favor +2 In the lake bed area on the way to the forsaken lands
[4:44:01] <seaechiowai> that's a big boy
[4:44:03] <%Felhad> psaDogchamp
[4:44:06] <$sassyquatch963> oh he's so good
[4:44:07] <SomeOtherNeb> "arf", he adds
[4:44:10] <RubberFistFight> @watts121 he meant me
[4:44:15] <%datNOISE> he's so talented!
[4:44:15] <WeebFever> will he ever stop growing larger
[4:44:18] <ralph4044> big stinky
[4:44:19] <IvanMistwalker> your son is big
[4:44:25] <%GingaNZ> its a huge walk to get to it as well
[4:44:27] <%Kevlar_Caviar> LUL damn
[4:44:29] <%abakkus> fuck that tree
[4:44:38] <%dekkitout> Map scrape, baby
[4:44:40] <SomeOtherNeb> no grace because the tree burned down, Pat
[4:44:41] <Saturation_Lizard> you lit the tree up there is no more guidance lmao
[4:44:42] <%notsoy> where torrent
[4:44:43] <+niknikmcsneakerton> has he done the haligtree?
[4:44:47] <+heiro001> they finally made the dark souls iii final area for real
[4:44:49] <%shootbang_exe> corhyn should be hanging around somewhere around here
[4:44:54] <%watts121> Torrent not being avalible during this last portion was a bad choice IMO
[4:44:55] <%baka_sugoi> way to go pat
[4:44:56] <leole11> @niknikmcsneakerton yesterday, yes
[4:44:56] <+bromontana> Giant dragon still looks fine tho
[4:44:56] <%Kevlar_Caviar> WOW THAT DRAGON IS WAY BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT
[4:44:57] <+heiro001> I mean ringed ciry was already kinda that too
[4:44:59] <%dekkitout> Still more preferable to Yharnam
[4:45:04] <mrtanaka111> fin d gold mask
[4:45:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> better get the broom and start sweeping
[4:45:09] <+niknikmcsneakerton> @leole11 ty
[4:45:11] <NaberiustheNefarious> I thought the frenzied flame ending would lead to ds1 not this
[4:45:13] <+SaintSalted> new zone hggCmon
[4:45:19] <+orochiblood> really fucked up that Eldrussy
[4:45:20] <%NBUsagi> @dekkitout lol yeah Yharnam is way worse XD
[4:45:24] <+Jeshk0> you really made a mess of this place
[4:45:24] <%shootbang_exe> gold mask is where the coliseum used to be
[4:45:26] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you can walk towards the arena and find goldmask now btw
[4:45:30] <oda_flobunaga> Corhyn's Dead, D E D Dead
[4:45:32] <%shootbang_exe> corhyn is near the big spear
[4:45:35] <%cade_calrayn> I don't know about Corhyn, but Goldmask was in that area with the flowers that you were wondering about how to reach near the Colisseum, Pat
[4:45:43] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt Corhyn only shows up if you gave him EVERY prayer book
[4:45:46] <SomeOtherNeb> I can't believe they add an extra zone after you finish the last zone on the map. This fucking game LUL
[4:45:57] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> not true
[4:46:02] <bluefootedtpeack> he's there isnt he to your left
[4:46:02] <+InhumanMilitia> can you climb the spear?
[4:46:02] <Sunstalker> They should really let you use Torrent here
[4:46:03] <+Smokebanshee> thats wrong
[4:46:08] <%EldritchBee> Corhyn is literally to your left
[4:46:08] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> I gave most if not all to turtle pope and he was still here
[4:46:08] <+Smokebanshee> Gave a bunch to turtle
[4:46:09] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Wrong
[4:46:10] <leole11> corhyn showed up for me without giving him a thing
[4:46:12] <+lord_sykos> Not true, I forgot to give him one
[4:46:13] <%EldritchBee> Turn around he's there
[4:46:14] <CasualHardcoreTheater> Cory showed up for me and I didn’t give him them all
[4:46:17] <bluefootedtpeack> dude he was there
[4:46:19] <bluefootedtpeack> on your left
[4:46:20] <+SaintSalted> i gave all my books too turtle bro cause he deserves it
[4:46:21] <%EldritchBee> He was ON CAMERA for a second
[4:46:22] <%Valdorick> Progress ahead
[4:46:22] <Paperware> One Guy
[4:46:24] <Lulu19> hoarah time
[4:46:24] <%watts121> there is another Ancient Stone at the real world Roundtable
[4:46:24] <CasualHardcoreTheater> He was I little past the grace
[4:46:24] <%EldritchBee> TURN BACK
[4:46:26] <Blank9> this feels like the 8th final  zone  in  a row
[4:46:29] <leole11> you passed him
[4:46:32] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> un hombre
[4:46:32] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt he only showed up when I have him the books
[4:46:33] <%notsoy> yeah no torrent is definitely a mistake
[4:46:39] <knotsundownsyndrome> chat don't say boss names
[4:46:42] <%EldritchBee> To the right around that corner
[4:46:42] <knotsundownsyndrome> jesus
[4:46:42] <%shootbang_exe> near big spear
[4:46:45] <leole11> near the spear
[4:46:45] <+Flunkorg> chats fucking with you I think
[4:46:46] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> straight line from the grace
[4:46:46] <%Felhad> super wrong, I found him and gave some to dog pope
[4:46:49] <NFTbad> Corhyn is, funnily enough, is not needed at all for the questline he is in
[4:46:53] <TwistParabola> near the spear apparently
[4:46:54] <%GingaNZ> spin the camera wildly
[4:47:17] <%Willowight> oh no
[4:47:19] <rosabellamelantha> ??? he was still at stargazers for me
[4:47:21] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> "he started T posing EVERYWHERE"
[4:47:22] <tolloponik> wow he's not taking it well
[4:47:26] <SomeOtherNeb> Jesus the NPCs in this game have it even rougher than in the rest of the series, there's not a single good end
[4:47:27] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You can also find goldmask here
[4:47:34] <+heiro001> that's rough buddy
[4:47:34] <%sniffy77> lol get rekt dude

[4:47:39] <%Felhad> @patstaresat He murdered Goldmask, kill him

[4:47:42] <DracaenaLeaf> your eyes are blindfolded dude
[4:47:53] <leole11> i'm happy for you or sorry that happened or whatever
[4:47:58] <%dekkitout> If you t pose for him will he feel better? Probably not...
[4:47:58] <%JoshManVGH> Dudes wearing a wheel talking about the masked dude being a madman
[4:48:00] <%watts121> So srsly the Erdtree is just straight up Fantasia right?
[4:48:02] <Omenaire_> is burning the erdtree required?
[4:48:02] <%Valdorick> So uh... Everyone involved with the Elden Ring seems FUCKING INSANE. Maybe Ranni is right... Maybe the Moon is the one true path.
[4:48:04] <+burnie_mcburntface> Yo that armor set with the skeleton mask is perfect
[4:48:05] <rosabellamelantha> go to the right of those stairs for goldmask @PatStaresAt

[4:54:10] <Saturation_Lizard> i think so because i actually never told him and he didn't cast scarlet aeonia on me
[4:54:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> TRUST NO BITCH
[4:54:12] <NaberiustheNefarious> This is heretical! Better save it for later!
[4:54:13] <+Kyma1020> he is literally THE ALL KNOWING
[4:54:13] <mikesapartment> oh that explains why i fucked him up no problem
[4:54:15] <%Valdorick> No Bloodflame with Mogh too
[4:54:15] <SomeOtherNeb> hahaha I figured I would stop talking to him the second I had good intel, that piece of shit
[4:54:17] <%livi242> he doesn't have it if you haven't fought her
[4:54:18] <%Mister_McDerp> ALL KNOWING
[4:54:19] <Sunstalker> IMAGINE IF GIDEON LEARNED MIMIC
[4:54:20] <$sassyquatch963> watch him summon a mimic tear too
[4:54:22] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA BULLY THE NERD
[4:54:28] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> No one tells him were you can find the mimic
[4:54:29] <HeroToxiko> LUL He literally tried to kill you before
[4:54:32] <cheesedburgers> Get mimic teared LOL
[4:54:35] <j_t_g_15> its like the summons fight in DMCV
[4:54:37] <WeebFever> and he has the rykard spell because you found that gideon-spy-corpse there!
[4:54:42] <+AyupaPupa> wow i'm not telling him shit next playthrough
[4:54:43] <MusouMiko> him having the rot spell actual makes him easier though lol
[4:54:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> get his ass Greg
[4:54:54] <%dekkitout> I see Gideon doesn't know shitall about Greg
[4:54:58] <MagisterBanana> I bet he didn't know about that mimic tear summoning knowledge, lmao get fucked
[4:55:01] <+zaddyforever> that phalanx is a bitch
[4:55:02] <SomeOtherNeb> @HeroToxiko right?? Dude sent his bodyguard to kill you and then just went "whoops he did that too early, my bad sis lmao"

[4:55:19] <OverlordedK> wow I rushed him down so hard I never even knew he could do half of this
[4:55:19] <Evendrag> gideon is THE MIMIC
[4:55:23] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Found out today that if you approach mimic tear or the stray with no weapons or armor then equip them once they turn into you the fight is laughable as they do like 2-3 damage a punch at most
[4:55:24] <%DEETRz> nerd aint no match for mimic
[4:55:28] <RustyQuarters> OOF BIG DEEPS
[4:55:28] <HeroToxiko> @HeroToxiko show up wearing his armor like "who is ensha"

[4:58:01] <%Valdorick> He saw some SHIT
[4:58:02] <%HiroProtagonest> It's been bothering me all game that the staff looks like something and I remember: it looks like the Pale King's symbol from Hollow Knight
[4:58:04] <vile_brand> that helm is cool
[4:58:04] <MagisterBanana> I guess he knew too much
[4:58:07] <zhenthrim213> HE LEARNED TOO MUCH

[4:58:11] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> sir gideon played through the game with a strategy guide in hand
[4:58:13] <%Deft_Thought> Wild shit
[4:58:13] <+Kyma1020> He stared at the Abyss and blinked
[4:58:16] <%dekkitout> GideonStaresAt The vast infinite
[4:58:16] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> The staff though
[4:58:23] <RustyQuarters> His brain got too big :(
[4:58:27] <zhenthrim213> man had 1000 insiht
[4:58:51] <badhaye> I saw someone use the frenzied flame grab move to 1 shot him and it was epic. He couldn't handle the truth
[4:58:52] <tri3dgE027> I wonder what soft-cap the PvP community will be making for this game
[4:58:54] <doster504> Would Nepheli have anything to say about him dying or is she broken?
[4:59:00] <yyyyfdugyu> i believe in gideon supremacy
[4:59:02] <+Glidemusic> what do you think of elden ring pat?
[4:59:09] <NewWillinium> Nope. Nephali remains broken
[4:59:11] <%Valdorick> @doster504 she's 100% broken

[4:59:17] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @tri3dgE027 Peopl have suggested 100, 125, 135, and 150. No one can agree on it.
[4:59:17] <narusao> fair
[4:59:18] <doster504> @tri3dgE027 they're thinking 120-150
[4:59:19] <General_Terro> LUL

[5:22:43] <$realm_forge> Squid1 Squid2 Squid3 Squid2 Squid4 HSWP
[5:22:45] <+InhumanMilitia> keeping tradition the final boss is meh
[5:22:46] <+KingKrampus> NANOMACHINES SON
[5:22:48] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt yeah so that background to me implies that the greater will has probably done this on MULTIPLE other planets
[5:22:49] <Sunstalker> Aw man, I was hoping it'd collapse into a shape for Marika when it stood up all straight.
[5:22:49] <bepsistorm> baby
[5:22:50] <%Kevlar_Caviar> TIME TO CONQUER THE LANDS BETWEEN!
[5:22:51] <wdga> let gief play

[5:22:53] <%jamsbybetty> learn how to power bomb
[5:22:53] <CasualHardcoreTheater> So much bloodborne I love it. And reminds me of Ash Lake too
[5:22:53] <+Pleblu> That thing looks like a winged space ween
[5:22:55] <afrotoa> So the first boos was the fisrt Elden lord, Second boss was the creator of the ring, and this third one is an alien?
[5:22:59] <%Willowight> why is it a dinosaur
[5:23:00] <%Valdorick> So... is Ranni like... a Doll... like her father/mother?
[5:23:00] <purple9z> probably my least favorite boss this game or at least close to it
[5:23:02] <%X2Eliah> But where's Marika tho
[5:23:03] <T_Sasquatch> I enjoy fromsoft going for the non-obvious easy mode setting LUL
[5:23:07] <bassoontyphoon> Wait do we ever fight marika
[5:23:09] <+Duskinfire> can guts and his big sword beat alien x? find out next time
[5:23:09] <%HiroProtagonest> I like how this game just got more and more Bloodborne as progressed, which tbf is also kinda how BB went
[5:23:13] <%anoldtoilet> the final boss being a weird alien and the erdtree is actually its weird golden nervous system is cool
[5:23:13] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Cosmic leech lookin ass
[5:23:14] <$realm_forge> I really wanna cosplay Godrick
[5:23:16] <%anoldtoilet> this is marika
[5:23:16] <%EldritchBee> what do you MEAN NOT THAT TOUGH
[5:23:17] <NewWillinium> So did anyone else think that Godfrey had been dead the entire time?
[5:23:17] <%TheAdMerlin> Person into sword is very gross
[5:23:17] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> I COULD RIP THE OUTER WILL IN HALF WITH MY BARE HANDS
[5:23:18] <OverlordedK> calling him not that tough LUL
[5:23:19] <ElSuperNova> @afrotoa It's like the "will" of the ring
[5:23:20] <%anoldtoilet> radagon is marika
[5:23:22] <MusouMiko> @bassoontyphoon r=m
[5:23:23] <Khester824> He;s the toughest part
[5:23:24] <%twistedj3ster> NOT THAT TOUGH?!
[5:23:25] <%dekkitout> From fighting some cool shirtless bors to some alien goober
[5:23:25] <RyuuAoi> He's hot
[5:23:28] <+KingofGriffons> like the time frame means its impossible miyazaki was inspired by the Attack on Titan worm right?
[5:23:31] <Lulu19> elden best theme is beautiful
[5:23:33] <+Flunkorg> not that tough eh?
[5:23:34] <+tetraes> I fuckin love the main theme of this game
[5:23:34] <%bluetocho13> Radagon is Marika
[5:23:34] <%notsoy> LMFAO
[5:23:35] <%mornerboi> "You're not that tough."
[5:23:36] <%GingaNZ> heard you talkiin SHIT
[5:23:37] <$OfficerMods> mimick could prolly solo radagan
[5:23:38] <bassoontyphoon> Ooooh
[5:23:38] <MildMannered_Creighton> Why is the space monster look... floppy
[5:23:39] <%LaughingCatt> he didnt appreciate saying he wasnt tough
[5:23:39] <+InhumanMilitia> @X2Eliah that is merika
[5:23:40] <AngryPumpkin1995> good job pat
[5:23:41] <iteruq> LUL
[5:23:41] <Midnight188> this is the most amazing shit like ever. holy crap well done From. im in Awe.
[5:23:41] <NewWillinium> Also for some reason Radagon just tore me the fuck UP for two nights in a row. The Golden Beast being much easier
[5:23:41] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @afrotoa third one IS the elden ring (it got explained in an item desc like, 2 streams ago which is REALLY weird)
[5:23:41] <+Pookiedaexzile> "Not so Tough"
[5:23:42] <BigFingerRo> THIS GUY'S FOR REAL GODDAMN
[5:23:43] <narusao> LUL
[5:23:43] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt Radagon is actually fairly tough without Mimic
[5:23:44] <%dekkitout> tajWHY
[5:23:46] <tmvct1> Radagon is Marika
[5:23:46] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[5:23:47] <%notsoy> classic crazy talk
[5:23:47] <oda_flobunaga> Everything about the design of this is cool, there are some aspects of the execution however...
[5:23:48] <kingra> LUL
[5:23:48] <+Aokaay> i clapped when the title screen music played
[5:23:49] <narusao> ironmouseFacepalm
[5:23:49] <+KingKrampus> COME ON AND SLAM, AND WELCOME TO THE JAM
[5:23:50] <Solidus_113> So the Elden Beast's golden innards look like the laniakea supercluster to me, anyone else?
[5:23:51] <Ghufufin> Gief knows
[5:23:52] <Mitchellsocks> Elden Beast is just Chaos from Sonic
[5:23:52] <$OfficerMods> grab attack did NO damage
[5:23:53] <%mornerboi> Crazy Talk strikes again
[5:23:53] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> I think It's more you being hyper geared
[5:23:54] <dan_g_v> hee, can't believe they spoiled this boss right from the beginning, on the reveal trailer way back then
[5:23:55] <superzebra101> gief is disappointed lol
[5:23:56] <%baka_sugoi> psaDogchamp "Get good Faterh"
[5:23:56] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt Did you remember that Hoarah Loux was in the intro?
[5:23:58] <sendart> psaDogchamp
[5:23:59] <Midnight188> I cannot wait to do this fight on my savefile this looks EPIC.
[5:24:00] <$EsotericOdyssey> @KingofGriffons i get more princess mononoke vibes frrom the elden beast
[5:24:03] <Akett> Yeah, I've seen Octopimp struggle some with Radagon.
[5:24:05] <$EsotericOdyssey> the tthing the forest god becomes
[5:24:05] <+Drigoooooo> yeah the mimic justs makes phase 1 a joke
[5:24:07] <%X2Eliah> yeah but we're fighting them in their radagon form, whhen do we fight them in their marika form
[5:24:08] <%Deft_Thought> @KingofGriffons More Spirited Away vibes
[5:24:09] <+Pookiedaexzile> Gief is embarrassed
[5:24:10] <MavMedic81> Greg needs to put in some work
[5:24:17] <leole11> you either meet, kill or do both to every single person mentioned in the intro
[5:24:22] <%Nekros4442> So...is Nepheli Godwin's daughter?
[5:24:23] <+Tyk1337> Pat is good af at this game lol
[5:24:25] <OverlordedK> I love how radagon holds his pose everytime you walk in
[5:24:26] <Baeltyr> gettem greg
[5:24:26] <%Nekros4442> Cus they have the same last names
[5:24:28] <BigBruthaThunda> they held it in their pants as long as they could
[5:24:28] <jubejube56> I wonder what determines boss aggro anyways, in that first attempt radagon was wailing on the mimic for a looooong time
[5:24:28] <tmvct1> Cant believe Hallucigenia also cause Elden Ring
[5:24:30] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt did you know that Radagon is actually Patches?
[5:24:30] <%anoldtoilet> @X2Eliah i think there may possibly be a time travel dlc like ds1 coming
[5:24:32] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> hoarah loux is armstrong
[5:24:34] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @X2Eliah marika was when they were hanging in the air, then she turned into radagon
[5:24:38] <NewWillinium> Oh right we just murdered Nephali's father. Or Relative of some kind depending on how the naming structure of her clan works
[5:24:41] <sirrice77> radagon took me a little bit because i didn't want to use summon
[5:24:47] <%anoldtoilet> i dont think we ever fight the real rennala either, or any of the gods in the prime
[5:24:47] <%ScreamLord> Title Theme for the Final Boss. Nice
[5:24:48] <MagisterBanana> Oh shit is that a buttcrack
[5:24:49] <%anoldtoilet> demigods
[5:24:57] <%Bluwizard21> Radagon is literally falling apart and still takes like half your flasks
[5:24:59] <%livi242> Radagon is kinda... 😳
[5:24:59] <%Valdorick> So, the Lion was a power limiter, to make him act more like a King. Its why he kills it, because it is infact his stand, and made up of his unending rage.
[5:25:04] <Memitim> @valdorick Ranni is a demigod but killed herself and put her soul in a doll
[5:25:08] <+5Two> Hoarah Loux Tekken DLC when?
[5:25:16] <BigBruthaThunda> did Pat do Goldmask's quest?
[5:25:20] <%Kevlar_Caviar> wait, is this the first time a soulsborne game has used the title theme in the final boss fight?
[5:25:23] <tmvct1> TIMING
[5:25:25] <Lulu19> elden beast is the essence of the ring, created by the divine will
[5:25:27] <sirrice77> he did
[5:25:28] <BigBruthaThunda> oh i guess so
[5:25:30] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> The lion was literally holding godfrey back
[5:25:31] <%abakkus> @BigBruthaThunda yeah, he knows
[5:25:33] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> GREG NO!
[5:25:34] <RyuuAoi> He's just a puppet, Pat
[5:25:42] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> So Marika fused with her son?
[5:25:48] <+lord_sykos> god some of these command grabs are brutal
[5:25:52] <%dekkitout> Nothing personal, Greg
[5:25:52] <@QueequegTheater> @TurtlesAndTentacles Radagon isn't her son
[5:25:53] <%anoldtoilet> i really like this design
[5:25:55] <WeebFever> Radagon and Marika appear to share a body but aren't consciously the same person, it's weird
[5:25:56] <%Bluwizard21> @Valdorick That's kinda what I think too. The Lion is a manifestation of his primal self before becoming lord and he had to excise it to fit the role of a god
[5:25:56] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @TurtlesAndTentacles radagon was her husband, not son
[5:25:56] <Mitchellsocks> @TurtlesAndTentacles Husband?
[5:25:57] <%Valdorick> No, Radagon was always Marika
[5:26:01] <%anoldtoilet> marika and radagon are just the same person
[5:26:02] <+Drigoooooo> Radagon and Marika were always the same person
[5:26:07] <%Nekros4442> Radagon and Marika are just the same person
[5:26:08] <%anoldtoilet> they married themselves
[5:26:08] <@QueequegTheater> There was no fusion
[5:26:09] <MusouMiko> I still think Malenia has the best grab
[5:26:09] <Lulu19> Marika and ravaging are the same but we don't know exactly what that means
[5:26:10] <MavMedic81> GO GREG GO
[5:26:11] <cavefishes> marika and radagon are the same person yes
[5:26:15] <@QueequegTheater> Radagon IS Marika
[5:26:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> Radagon is Marikas Strapon
[5:26:15] <%anoldtoilet> theyre very happy together
[5:26:17] <Memitim> @turtlesandtentacles you're thinking of Radhan, this is Radagon
[5:26:19] <%furiousfurioso> it's unclear if they were 2 people fused or if they were always one person
[5:26:22] <+BoboDaHobo> just like a castlevania it ends with a teleporting boss
[5:26:24] <+ScrapKingKeita> GREG NO
[5:26:25] <blue8moon> it would be real cool to meet radagon/marika back in the day
[5:26:26] <%dekkitout> evanf7
[5:26:27] <%baka_sugoi> GREEEEEEG
[5:26:28] <+Jeshk0> greg, nooooooo
[5:26:29] <%HiroProtagonest> Greg! D:
[5:26:29] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Bluwizard21 nah the lion existed before godfrey came into the picture, he lived in farum azula
[5:26:29] <tmvct1> @Bluwizard21 he conquered sarosh in the wars
[5:26:30] <%Valdorick> The Truth Renalla learned was that Miraka catfished her the entire time.
[5:26:30] <cavefishes> NOOO
[5:26:33] <%Mister_McDerp> GREEEEEGGGG
[5:26:33] <oda_flobunaga> The Radagon Marika thing is a very Bhuddist take on the concept of Duality
[5:26:34] <BigBruthaThunda> single independent space god don't need no man
[5:26:35] <V0LK__> greg dead before beast, not good =/
[5:26:35] <%Bluwizard21> Anyone Know how to continue Nephili Loux's questline past giving her the stormhawk king ashes?
[5:26:35] <Profmcstevie> THE STRENGTH OF GREG FALTERS
[5:26:39] <+godzookylives> NO BULLY GREG BibleThump
[5:26:39] <%Nekros4442> oh that doesnt bode well
[5:26:41] <MavMedic81> GREG NO!!!
[5:26:44] <oda_flobunaga> Buddhist
[5:26:46] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @Memitim Radham is also not her son, kinda
[5:26:46] <$Futurecity10> My main complaint of the game is that the music isnt on par with DS3
[5:26:47] <Calek> they're two beings in one but then they had a disagreement
[5:26:48] <+WutangchickeN> wutang6BEES wutang6BEES
[5:26:49] <cavefishes> hurt greg and then hurt you :(
[5:26:49] <morkelebmink> is it Tyche time?
[5:26:50] <doster504> @Bluwizard21 it's broken you can't
[5:26:51] <NewWillinium> From what I understand Radagon and Marika are the same whole person, but two halves of the same person in conflict with one another.
[5:26:52] <MagisterBanana> GREG HAS MET HIS MATCH
[5:26:53] <%NBUsagi> Gief powers
[5:26:55] <TheSphereHunter> it's cool how the first trailer for this game showed this person hammering away with this song playing and come to find out it's the final boss!
[5:26:55] <%X2Eliah> Greg need to level up a bit yo
[5:26:55] <$OfficerMods> imagine if dhalsim teleports came with a projectile on frame 1
[5:26:55] <%soloshotfirst82> First he hurts your Greg, then he hurts your you ...
[5:26:55] <%baka_sugoi> csbeastSetIn GREG WHYYYYY
[5:26:56] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Bluwizard21 the second half of her quest literally isn't in the game LUL
[5:26:56] <Khester824> GREG IS DEAD LONG LIVE GREG
[5:26:59] <+Nero_Cross> @Bluwizard21 You can't, she's cut content
[5:27:01] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @Memitim These fucking names I swear lol
[5:27:02] <+Shoosler> what is Pat's SL?
[5:27:03] <%dekkitout> @morkelebmink Tiche em a lesson
[5:27:03] <satiresatyr> BibleThump
[5:27:04] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater i thought that was still somewhat unclear, whether they started out as two and became one, or if they've always been that way
[5:27:04] <%Bluwizard21> @doster504 Wonderful
[5:27:05] <doster504> @Futurecity10 this theme fucks idk what you mean
[5:27:06] <Lulu19> exactly @calek
[5:27:07] <MavMedic81> F
[5:27:07] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Radagon is Marika as batman is Bruce
[5:27:09] <sirrice77> @oda_flobunaga i heard radagon/marika being described as an alchemy thing too
[5:27:11] <%X2Eliah> Greg got grogged
[5:27:11] <+SilverDevilfish> Go fuck yourself Radagon... oh wait
[5:27:19] <+donutmcbronut> Radigon and Merika are two halves of the same entity. They're simultaneously the same person, and also two personas with different motives
[5:27:21] <%ScreamLord> This is basically Gwyn but actually challenging
[5:27:22] <%EldritchBee> @Futurecity10 What are you fucking talking about this blows every other theme out of the water
[5:27:23] <%anoldtoilet> @oda_flobunaga yeah theres some of this too
[5:27:23] <RubberFistFight> @Bluwizard21 wait, really?
[5:27:25] <Memitim> @bluwizard21 Nobody knows atm but it's speculated that it's unfinished and cut content
[5:27:43] <$Futurecity10> Song's like one point down from Abyss watchers
[5:27:44] <+Drigoooooo> they split into two but when Radagon left Renala he becmae whole with Marika again
[5:27:44] <MusouMiko> @ScreamLord have you tried parrying radagon? it turns him into the best version of gwyn they've ever made
[5:27:44] <coziestbank> @SilverDevilfish NOW NEITHER OF US WILL BE VIRGINS!
[5:27:47] <%Bluwizard21> K so first DLC then?
[5:27:48] <%Valdorick> @TheSphereHunter The first trailer also spoiled that Radagon and Marika are the same person. Every time the hammer fell and lit up the scene, the person with the hammer had different color hair (red and gold)
[5:27:52] <%anoldtoilet> this is a cool boss
[5:28:01] <oda_flobunaga> Creation and Destruction in one Being, Alpha and Omega.  Male and Female. Yin and Yang.  Aun
[5:28:09] <RubberFistFight> Nepheli's questline being half-scrapped is the fucking dumbest shit. Why not just remove it all? LUL
[5:28:18] <MavMedic81> Greg doing work!!!
[5:28:22] <%HiroProtagonest> The only music I remember from DS3 is Dragonslayer Armour, course I only remember one or two songs from each Souls game anyway
[5:28:26] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @RubberFistFight the second half of her quest is in the game's files as dialogue subtitles but isn't in the actual game, same goes for kenneth haight
[5:28:36] <Sunstalker> @RubberFistFight Maybe they thought nobody could finish the game before they patched it in? LuL
[5:28:37] <doster504> @Futurecity10 that is a good theme but eh to each their own it is music
[5:28:40] <%Valdorick> Mirika wanted to destroy the Elden Ring, Radagon wanted to repair it.
[5:28:41] <RustyQuarters> Treesus is ANGRY
[5:28:43] <%mornerboi> @RubberFistFight wait it was scrapped? I thought my game just bugged. You're telling me it just fucking ends there?
[5:28:43] <Lulu19> twin prince thene slaps
[5:28:45] <+KingKrampus> @oda_flobunaga Anima and Animus
[5:28:45] <RyuuAoi> Asaaaaaa
[5:28:46] <BigFingerRo> Pat's whiffin like a straight up BOT
[5:28:49] <%anoldtoilet> nephelis stuff is so prominent i feel like it has to eventually be patched in or addressed yeah
[5:28:49] <hise97> Diallos quest just stops too. It’s weird
[5:28:50] <%anoldtoilet> lol
[5:28:50] <Baeltyr> wooooooo greg
[5:28:51] <%mugennoken> CLUTCH GREG
[5:28:51] <+dearghostss> greg mvp
[5:28:51] <ape_hawk> lets hear it for Greg, the true elden lord!
[5:28:52] <rudiciuscaesar> Just tuned in, what boss is this? lol
[5:28:54] <OverlordedK> this is really showing me how invicinble my mimic was due to having elden tree heal on my kit lol
[5:28:54] <rudiciuscaesar> OHHH
[5:28:54] <Midnight188> imagine marrying yourself and having kids. who needs to find another half, just become your other half.
[5:28:58] <leovaldezking> what is that move
[5:28:58] <rudiciuscaesar> nevermind, I can tell which it is
[5:29:01] <Lulu19> this theme is soooo good
[5:29:01] <RyuuAoi> This song going off ha
[5:29:03] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @rudiciuscaesar THE FINAL ONE LUL
[5:29:07] <%AHomeschoolDropout> I'm still not clear on what the Greater Will is. Is it just god? lmao
[5:29:10] <narusao> LUL
[5:29:10] <+Papafleish> I feel like I'd like it more if they reversed the order of Radagon and Elden Beast
[5:29:11] <RubberFistFight> @Kevlar_Caviar and that's completely dumb. IMHO half-finished deliberately uncompletable quests are worse than if they just removed them entirely and had them as a side character with some dialogue.
[5:29:12] <oda_flobunaga> Agyo to Ungyo
[5:29:12] <KatabolicRage> I hate this guy
[5:29:12] <Darkrenai> LUL

[5:29:18] <ExpressNode> How the fuck do you dodge that?
[5:29:18] <bepsistorm> pepehands
[5:29:18] <+Drigoooooo> you just have to run
[5:29:19] <%Valdorick> You're getting really bad luck on their moveset.
[5:29:19] <+Pookiedaexzile> Strap in Folks
[5:29:20] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> You get up too fast maybe

[5:29:27] <$Futurecity10> Get owned by this Plesioth
[5:29:28] <%Rafferty3231> wait what
[5:29:28] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt This is the best part, yes the boss can oneshot you before you can move
[5:29:31] <+KingKrampus> @midnight188 that's actually a thing in some ancient Gnostic theologjes
[5:29:32] <%notsoy> you obviously can't dodge it lmao
[5:29:33] <%JoshManVGH> This things gonna be a fuck
[5:29:34] <Lulu19> elden beast is actually pretty hard imo
[5:29:35] <%X2Eliah> can you horse?
[5:29:35] <rudiciuscaesar> @Kevlar_Caviar yeah, the second I saw Elden Beast, I knew lol. That is the most obvious "final boss" in the entire series if you ask me
[5:29:36] <ElSuperNova> mon hunrules, stay on ground
[5:29:36] <%jamsbybetty> it's a dragon breath if you run around and up to him you won't get hit
[5:29:38] <Sunstalker> It's cool to fight in Neo Ash Lake
[5:29:40] <+Shoosler> Pat did you know that's a boss?
[5:29:42] <+suicidallobo> @AHomeschoolDropout it seems to be just one of many outer gods
[5:29:43] <RubberFistFight> So I've heard that this guy completely removes your will to live as one of his attacks, but it only shows up after you've fought him a few times Kappa
[5:29:43] <cavefishes> you go behind it or get away
[5:29:47] <CasualHardcoreTheater> If you want a tip… Run behind him when he does that.
[5:29:48] <purple9z> run directly behind to dodge that one
[5:29:51] <leole11> behind the elden beast is safe
[5:29:54] <sirrice77> Idk about this radagon/marika stuff. Next you're gonna tell me Pat and Greg are the same person
[5:29:57] <digaogrunge> get some resists, you almost survived
[5:29:57] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt Pat look out LUL
[5:30:00] <%SlimmieP> One thing I dont like about Souls bosses is a lot of the time they invalidate your abilities and it just goes back to timing your dodges
[5:30:02] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @RubberFistFight yeah it's one of the few complaints i have about this game, it's super weird that they decided to just leave in the half-finished quests
[5:30:02] <%Valdorick> Millicent makes sense, when you think about it... after all, Malenia was born from 1 parent too Kappa
[5:30:02] <NewWillinium> @RubberFistFight This is very much true. Especially playing as a caster
[5:30:06] <%SlimmieP> Ar least elden ring got summons
[5:30:10] <%SlimmieP> So you can do cool shit
[5:30:12] <Midnight188> @KingKrampus oh yeah. Angels fusing with other Angels, splitting into other Angels....celestial entities don't really do Sex.
[5:30:13] <tmvct1> @PatStaresAt You need to summon Eren Yeager for that boss fight
[5:30:18] <rudiciuscaesar> oh a two part final boss fight?
[5:30:26] <V0LK__> he shattered your ring bro
[5:30:33] <Lulu19> radagon Marika is why mimic is so strong because if you don't got me I got me
[5:30:33] <%dekkitout> Nailed it
[5:30:34] <NewWillinium> Wbat's that casting a spell from halfway across the arena? Here let me Fly like fucking Thor to slam a hammer in your face.
[5:30:35] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Godfreys armor is purchasable btw
[5:30:36] <RubberFistFight> oh shit he fuckin saw you comin a mile away
[5:30:37] <Profmcstevie> Get FORGED
[5:30:37] <+Pyx_LocKe> oroJAM oroJAM oroJAM oroJAM
[5:30:37] <MagisterBanana> That golf swing
[5:30:39] <%anoldtoilet> pulling out new moves on the third fight
[5:30:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> Forged
[5:30:39] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt he's not so tough huh?
[5:30:40] <oda_flobunaga> the Simulacrum
[5:30:41] <rudiciuscaesar> Zangief so kawaii
[5:30:41] <Komayeda> i like how the guy from the trailer ended up being the second to last boss
[5:30:42] <+niknikmcsneakerton> @valdorick gowry calls her his daughter tho
[5:30:43] <leole11> he shattered the elden ring, he will shatter you too
[5:30:43] <%X2Eliah> Hey at least the final boss isn't a duo battle
[5:30:43] <Saturation_Lizard> you got shattered by someone, or something
[5:30:43] <NewWillinium> Turning on a DIME
[5:30:45] <%MartinOfLoxley> psaGiefstare psaGiefstare psaGiefstare
[5:30:45] <%jamsbybetty> at least you didn't roll off the edge
[5:30:45] <+Jeshk0> time to give gief a shot at it
[5:30:46] <doster504> @RubberFistFight is it the super grab where he puts you in the rune?
[5:30:53] <Midnight188> imagine if Blaidd was summonable for this
[5:30:54] <medril07> @tmvct1 he's not fighting eren yaegar?
[5:30:57] <+GammaSan55> Radagon has red hair and a small hammer? He's just Thor
[5:30:58] <ExpressNode> Greg can do it himself he independent mimic that don't need no summoner
[5:30:58] <RubberFistFight> rubber16Sunbro
[5:30:59] <doster504> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[5:31:00] <Frostydough1> pat do you have a second to talk about your horses extended warranty
[5:31:03] <rudiciuscaesar> Tag in Gief, give him the controller lol
[5:31:05] <tolloponik> @tmvct1 eren is a bitch simp
[5:31:08] <%ScreamLord> Anyone getting Attack On Titan Vibes with the Elden Beast? Kinda looks like the parasite that gave Ymir her powers
[5:31:09] <Lulu19> use the holy resistance talisman
[5:31:10] <rosabellamelantha> @niknikmcsneakerton Gowry also says he adopted her in the same convo
[5:31:13] <Lulu19> pat
[5:31:13] <NewWillinium> This is truly Anglo-Saxon Souls
[5:31:13] <+dudlerand> I think they designed this final boss specfiically to counter summons, unlike malenia
[5:31:15] <%anoldtoilet> he shattered the elden ring but also the elden ring is the only thing holding his shattered body together :thinking:
[5:31:15] <%Felhad> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[5:31:17] <%Valdorick> @niknikmcsneakerton He's a rot cultist, I doubt its literal.
[5:31:18] <hise97> Did pat fight malenia?
[5:31:20] <%murdocismyhero> I was watching a caveman run before coming in here.  Pat is like an anime hero
[5:31:26] <boostergoldz> who's rowdy
[5:31:32] <doster504> @hise97 yes
[5:31:33] <tmvct1> @medril07 good point. He needs to summon Mikasa then. spoilers
[5:31:34] <leole11> @hise97 yesterday, yes
[5:31:34] <ohno58> What's wrong with being rowdy?
[5:31:34] <UltimateFloofyBoi> ganondorf got a ugly glow-up
[5:31:41] <Ninjalettuce> oh shit is that the elden ring
[5:31:42] <NewWillinium> @anoldtoilet I thought it was Marika who shattered the ring with Radagon trying to preserve it?
[5:31:42] <+Shoosler> the ideal way to experience a game is to not play it? lol wut
[5:31:45] <MagisterBanana> THE DOUBLE
[5:31:46] <V0LK__> the double ashe was badass LUL
[5:31:48] <Chaos_Aether> TWIN BLACK BLADE
[5:31:49] <rosabellamelantha> @ScreamLord They both pull on the idea of a primal parasite (which is what the erdtree is) so the similarities are clear
[5:31:55] <+suicidallobo> watching pat just makes me realize just how busted bleed weapons are. was way lower leveled than pat and destroyed this fight
[5:31:56] <+Nero_Cross> @Kevlar_Caviar The one tiny glimmer of hope that it's some kind of mistake and not just a cut content mess is one of the unfinished NPCs is Patches of all people, I feel like they wouldn't leave the fucking series mascot unfinished
[5:31:56] <+niknikmcsneakerton> he implies he at least knows malenia
[5:32:01] <Profmcstevie> The RTX destroyed that yelp LUL sounded like drowning
[5:32:02] <%Valdorick> God, this fight has such fucked dodge windows
[5:32:03] <RubberFistFight> You must defeat Calamity Ganon to save Hyrule.
[5:32:08] <MagisterBanana> GREG LET'S GOOOO
[5:32:10] <medril07> @tmvct1 he's even got the war hammer haha

[5:32:34] <TwistParabola> LETS GOOOO
[5:32:37] <Lulu19> this theme
[5:32:38] <%soloshotfirst82> He is Greg, Blade of Patron

[5:32:39] <bassoontyphoon> COME THROUGH GREG
[5:32:39] <digaogrunge> SHILED UP
[5:32:52] <%SaiyanShoto> Is the Elden Ring the Elden Beasts butthole?
[5:32:54] <medril07> get that fucking brontosaurus
[5:32:55] <Chaos_Aether> HOLY SHIT
[5:32:55] <+Grayhammatter> greg no!
[5:33:00] <V0LK__> holy fuck O_O'
[5:33:00] <TwistParabola> GREG
[5:33:01] <rudiciuscaesar> this celestial axolotl looking thing....
[5:33:04] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Nero_Cross oh god i didn't know about that one, they really didn't wanna delay this again huh
[5:33:04] <%Valdorick> Greg just being a fucking target dummy for Elden Beast
[5:33:08] <%dekkitout> CLUTCH HEAL
[5:33:10] <+suicidallobo> space nessy
[5:33:10] <Profmcstevie> Greg doing what he can
[5:33:14] <+Rofiarf> like astel
[5:33:15] <UltimateFloofyBoi> Greg can heal?
[5:33:18] <%dekkitout> Greg's a pro
[5:33:18] <%anoldtoilet> throwing space at you
[5:33:19] <tmvct1> move from Astel
[5:33:19] <Lulu19> the loreee
[5:33:22] <ohno58> space perfume
[5:33:25] <%anoldtoilet> lmfao perfumers...? wtf...
[5:33:29] <%Monkeyweed21> super nebula
[5:33:31] <RubberFistFight> ok so all those erdtrees in the background... is it implying that this fuckin THING has done this shit to other worlds?
[5:33:31] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> cosmos
[5:33:36] <Calek> I like how the damage is just bugged
[5:33:37] <$sassyquatch963> its sword looks like skin
[5:33:39] <rudiciuscaesar> did Pat have to respec to use that new sword?
[5:33:39] <MagisterBanana> Fiiiish
[5:33:40] <%Bluwizard21> The hardest part of the speedrun atm. Getting the bitch to stay still
[5:33:43] <Chaos_Aether> super nova
[5:33:44] <%Kevlar_Caviar> god i fucking love this thing's design, it's so good
[5:33:46] <rosabellamelantha> Black hole
[5:33:48] <Finchit> Not perfume bruh
[5:33:48] <%mornerboi> @UltimateFloofyBoi sure can. If you equip the Erdtree Heal and summon him with a Faith cast stick, he can be the best healbot in the game.
[5:33:49] <tolloponik> is it growing
[5:33:49] <%Valdorick> Never saw THAT move! Holyshit
[5:33:49] <+niknikmcsneakerton> this boss is like the thing in princess mononoke
[5:33:51] <+LandOfTheWay> literal supernova attack
[5:33:52] <+Shoosler> that's a lotta napalm
[5:33:53] <doster504> @RubberFistFight or there could be that many
[5:33:55] <+KingKrampus> elden beast looks like Princess Mononoke Forest God
[5:33:57] <@QueequegTheater> @Calek It's not
[5:33:57] <+Drigoooooo> cant believe that mimic just ate the move lol
[5:34:01] <medril07> unleashes Sephiroth attack
[5:34:02] <AngryAsian5> Man, Greg is really taking one for the team here
[5:34:03] <NewWillinium> Why is a Space Plesiosaur using a Sword?
[5:34:04] <UltimateFloofyBoi> Getsuga tensho looks cool in this
[5:34:05] <wdga> this pokemon is upset
[5:34:07] <%anoldtoilet> @RubberFistFight i think so maybe...? like the erdtree is a branch of the weird nervous system inside of that thing too
[5:34:09] <Lulu19> here it is
[5:34:11] <+Rofiarf> JUMP!
[5:34:11] <rosabellamelantha> @RubberFistFight it is heavily implying the elden ring world is just one of many alien body farms basically
[5:34:13] <+heiro001> oh no
[5:34:13] <MildMannered_Creighton> just a big prehensile space dick monster
[5:34:13] <+ScrapKingKeita> hopscotch time
[5:34:14] <oda_flobunaga> Everything about this fight is great, except for the fight itself
[5:34:14] <%NBUsagi> and there is the Elden Ring
[5:34:15] <NewWillinium> And this is my favorite boss attack in the game
[5:34:16] <MagisterBanana> This shit gorgeous thoug
[5:34:17] <Profmcstevie> Space Plesioth you MOTHERFUCKER
[5:34:18] <+wizard_of_diamonds> It's so brutal and dehumanizing how the Elden Beast uses Radogan and Marika as a sword. It really shows how bad the system is.
[5:34:18] <%abakkus> boss shit
[5:34:19] <+dearghostss> psaHoldon
[5:34:19] <%DEETRz> good thing it was on greg
[5:34:20] <ohno58> jump
[5:34:20] <%dekkitout> To think it took fighting capital G God for greg to finally heal
[5:34:20] <%Kevlar_Caviar> GOD IT'S SO COOL
[5:34:21] <NewWillinium> This ring attack is AWESOME
[5:34:22] <%Valdorick> Behold... The Elden Ring... nuke
[5:34:22] <%baka_sugoi> OMG WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace
[5:34:22] <%murdocismyhero> Is this an anime now?
[5:34:24] <legend_of_nolan> RUN AWAY RUN AWAY
[5:34:25] <Profmcstevie> GREG NOOO
[5:34:29] <TwistParabola> GREG
[5:34:31] <+Nero_Cross> @Kevlar_Caviar It's super odd, it's the worst it's ever been, there's like 6 or so high profile NPCs in total that are just busted, Alexander gives you a key item that's supposed to interact with an entire cut npc town LUL
[5:34:32] <%Monkeyweed21> BEHOLD ELDEN RING
[5:34:34] <%SaiyanShoto> GREG
[5:34:34] <%dekkitout> evanf7

[5:34:57] <BigBruthaThunda> oh fuck that orb attack
[5:34:58] <17sevens> worst attack in the game
[5:34:58] <+vaderxyz1970> With all the Trees in the background is it a hint that this thing is galactic parasite that spreads trees through the universe?
[5:35:01] <%anoldtoilet> thing thing is so cool
[5:35:01] <MagisterBanana> JOHN ELDEN RING HIMSELF
[5:35:05] <%baka_sugoi> IT'S SO BEATUFUL

[5:35:22] <+GammaSan55> Huge princess mononoke vibes off this boss
[5:35:24] <Profmcstevie> Hey I stole that, don't use it!
[5:35:28] <V0LK__> are we fighting LAVOS?
[5:35:29] <rudiciuscaesar> does it have battle damage on it?
[5:35:29] <Sunstalker> I'm pretty sure this thing allows the spell to exist in the first place
[5:35:30] <+Drigoooooo> lol
[5:35:31] <rosabellamelantha> @vaderxyz1970 it's form is HEAVILY based on an ancient parasite we had on earth so yeah
[5:35:32] <%dekkitout> D:
[5:35:32] <+Shoosler> was that a stagger?
[5:35:33] <%Valdorick> PIXEL

[5:35:33] <%X2Eliah> man with all those effects, this battle is gonna lag on PC
[5:35:33] <tmvct1> the greed

[5:35:56] <+KingKrampus> @gammasan55 THATS WHAT I Was saying, Mononoke Forest God
[5:35:57] <%dekkitout> What kind of galactic rasengan?
[5:35:57] <NewWillinium> So this boss uses mainly Holy damage right? Man I wonder how Holy builds deal with it
[5:35:58] <%anoldtoilet> oh this is really cool and psycho
[5:35:59] <+LandOfTheWay> i like that we're standing before the most deific looking thing ever and it can still be killed by a big wooden club. gods ain't shit

[5:36:26] <%HiroProtagonest> @Nero_Cross I really wanted this game to have a place where you'd get to send NPCs to congregate, like Cathedral Ward in Bloodborne, so hearing that they probably cut an NPC town is so sad
[5:36:27] <%Willowight> platformer
[5:36:28] <JPope3614> so close
[5:36:28] <+GammaSan55> that's some BS
[5:36:28] <Parapattern> Ah! The elden ring is attacking me!

[5:36:34] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you have to jump over those
[5:36:35] <rudiciuscaesar> those fire breath attacks are not fun, like they genuinely suck

[5:37:04] <+Nero_Cross> @HiroProtagonest The town is still in the game but everyone in it is hostile LUL
[5:37:04] <Midnight188> can you stay down for breath attacks to not get OTG'd?
[5:37:06] <legend_of_nolan> mario odyssy is the best darks souls of mario games
[5:37:13] <Profmcstevie> When you jump the elder creatures light rays, remember to DO A FLIP
[5:37:14] <Grave_Titan_D> Kill god pat
[5:37:15] <Crowroost> As a diehard mageboy I can't even begin to FATHOM how thiss boss is done in melee
[5:37:23] <bassoontyphoon> Jump them, like Mario and Princess Beach
[5:37:25] <oda_flobunaga> @Midnight188 no
[5:37:27] <$realm_forge> Remember at the beginning when Pat kept getting his ass beat by a bunch of bum soldiers on a bridge? Look at him now. Fighting gods and shit
[5:37:36] <%Dew217> Pat we need you to kill the Creator of Everything
[5:37:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Crowroost just hit it a lot and don't get hit
[5:37:46] <+Grayhammatter> faster dying though
[5:37:47] <TwistParabola> GWYN
[5:37:48] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @realm_forge *getting his ass beat by gods LUL
[5:37:51] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @Midnight188 yes
[5:37:52] <legend_of_nolan> @realm_forge truely he is the elden loard
[5:37:53] <%Valdorick> His version of Sunlight Spear is super fucking rad
[5:37:53] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> The greed
[5:37:53] <%anoldtoilet> thats definitely not the creator
[5:37:54] <BigFingerRo> I gotta admit, Pat gets much less salty than I'd get
[5:37:57] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Isn't Radagon's theme the title music?
[5:37:59] <+stoatacious> this guy is pretty hot
[5:38:00] <%dekkitout> Though it is weird to see a whole ass alien god using a SWORD
[5:38:00] <Sunstalker> @HiroProtagonest What is it?
[5:38:02] <luciluxlu0> give Greg a heal maybe?
[5:38:03] <RubberFistFight> pat why haven't you attacked and dethroned god yet. you're slacking, come on. Kappa
[5:38:07] <MusouMiko> they're just two halves of the same god
[5:38:07] <Midnight188> someone just said no and you said yes which is it
[5:38:08] <+Smokebanshee> kinda
[5:38:08] <%Valdorick> Creation and Destruction
[5:38:08] <%anoldtoilet> the games super clear that the world existed before the tree, hes a super Lavos alien parasite
[5:38:10] <+Rofiarf> no idea
[5:38:11] <+vaderxyz1970> Godwyn dieing
[5:38:11] <$realm_forge> LUL LUL
[5:38:12] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt MArika wanted to give rennala the D
[5:38:13] <%kknutson4> she stole the boondogle
[5:38:13] <TwistParabola> who knows
[5:38:14] <tmvct1> wait for the boss weapon lore
[5:38:15] <NewWillinium> I think Marika wanted to destroy the Elden Ring, while Radagon wanted to preserve it?
[5:38:15] <badhaye> When the enemy won't let you anime because they're anime
[5:38:17] <MusouMiko> yin and yang etc.
[5:38:17] <Lulu19> no we do t know
[5:38:18] <TwistParabola> Let's ask Vaati in a month
[5:38:18] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt The concept of Duality be like that
[5:38:18] <+Smokebanshee> Not fully clear but some infrence can be made
[5:38:21] <coziestbank> Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus
[5:38:22] <T_Sasquatch> literally no one knows if they are the same person or a combined person
[5:38:22] <+seaearthandsky> you mean godfrey?
[5:38:23] <medril07> need vaati for that probs
[5:38:28] <jubejube56> There was dialog melina could talk about at the queens bedchamber grace I think
[5:38:28] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt did you do the law of regression church thing?
[5:38:29] <Paperware> I think she got cursed by the giants or something
[5:38:29] <RyuuAoi> Can you rot an alien? For phase 2
[5:38:30] <purple9z> they are basically two separate personalities in one body
[5:38:34] <kingra> Creation and destruction probably
[5:38:37] <%dekkitout> Boss souls prolly mentions
[5:38:44] <%Valdorick> Marika order Godwryn's assassination and let Ranni get away with half of the rune of death.
[5:38:45] <djblue_shift> she thought rennala was hot
[5:38:45] <RubberFistFight> Marika stole the scrimblo
[5:38:46] <$sassyquatch963> @seaearthandsky marika's son, godwyn
[5:38:47] <roguemephilesclone> Radagan follows the Golden Order. Marika is the Shattering's culprit.
[5:38:51] <medril07> maybe radagon a fake marika?
[5:38:52] <NewWillinium> @Monkeyweed21 He has unlocked every ending and already decided which he will do
[5:39:01] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @Midnight188 I think it depends on the breath attack, i know for sure that some dragons you can do it
[5:39:04] <RubberFistFight> Radagon needed the scrimblo to fix his blepblorp.
[5:39:11] <mihokspawn> Marika went I don't like space dragon... Radagan said naaah I like space dragon
[5:39:12] <oda_flobunaga> @Monkeyweed21 he got told on Twitter
[5:39:18] <%anoldtoilet> i dont think they have separtate goals and a bunch of people lie to you in this game
[5:39:18] <Nosphomet> vaatis waiting for other people to figure out the story lmao
[5:39:20] <%ScreamLord> The Emperor of Mankind could get down with this golden bullshit
[5:39:20] <jubejube56> It was a quote like "O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order. Thou'rt yet to become me, thou'rt yet to become a god. Let us both be shattered, mine other half"
[5:39:22] <tolloponik> jump?
[5:39:22] <%JonathLP> jump
[5:39:24] <NewWillinium> Dodge into it at the last second before he hits the earth towoards him
[5:39:27] <Chaos_Aether> Jump it>
[5:39:29] <Chaos_Aether> ?
[5:39:30] <+InhumanMilitia> run at and roll
[5:39:31] <%anoldtoilet> marika and radagon are the same person
[5:39:33] <+vaderxyz1970> Any lore for why these two share a body?
[5:39:34] <medril07> depends who actually broke the elden ring
[5:39:34] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt Radagon MADE the golden order he didn't want to end it while Marika wanted to shatter the Elden ring and the greater will's control
[5:39:35] <%Valdorick> oof
[5:39:40] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt it's super not clear, but marika's echoes that melina talks about mention that marika wanted to figure out more about the Golden Order and not live in blind faith, and she also calls radagon a loyal dog of that Order
[5:39:41] <+stoatacious> very tight roll
[5:39:47] <Profmcstevie> Remember your jumps Mister Mario
[5:39:49] <bassoontyphoon> @patstaresat Radagan and Merika are basically Doppio and Diavolo
[5:39:53] <+InhumanMilitia> no idea other than a long con for one being to be eldin lord?
[5:39:59] <%earthboy2k> classic GRRM and his weird sibling rivaling storytelling
[5:40:02] <oda_flobunaga> Read up on the Buddhist concept of Duality
[5:40:02] <Lulu19> ranni prob Infleunced Marika is some way.
[5:40:04] <$LucasifTheOdd> Oh wow I tuned in at a good time. Is this his first playthrough still?
[5:40:07] <%anoldtoilet> but again they are the same person
[5:40:07] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Healing is overrated
[5:40:11] <MagisterBanana> Well, this boss seems to be perfectly capable of handling the summons and the player
[5:40:16] <RubberFistFight> it's pretty clear that the elden beast/Greater Will are NOT forces for good.
[5:40:16] <purple9z> you should have a faith spell that basically negates holy for this fight
[5:40:18] <+M0untain_wolf> so much loyalty and dogma
[5:40:19] <+donutmcbronut> @LucasifTheOdd first playthrough, final boss
[5:40:21] <rudiciuscaesar> is this dude the previous Elden Lord? Still playing catch up
[5:40:21] <medril07> I don't trust those fucking fingers that's for sure
[5:40:26] <%Cigwynn> @patstaresat the big dive he does, roll behind him like Malenia
[5:40:29] <KatabolicRage> Marika seems to have gotten rather disillusioned with the whole greater will thing
[5:40:32] <Darkrenai> Was Radagon and Marika always the same person? Or did they get combined at some point?
[5:40:35] <+Drigoooooo> it seems when they split Marika started to betray everything and Radagon wanted to stop that
[5:40:47] <+donutmcbronut> @rudiciuscaesar He's the other half of the goddess Merika
[5:40:49] <+Smokebanshee> @Darkrenai Implied to be always the same
[5:40:50] <Lulu19> radagon is the elden lord
[5:40:54] <NewWillinium> @rudiciuscaesar Radagon was the Consort to the Goddess Marika, who was married to the first Elden Lord Godfrey
[5:40:55] <+RedMaskBandit> you're perfect
[5:40:58] <+Akizea> theres some real ass hitbox porn during this fight sometimes lol
[5:40:59] <%dekkitout> Wow, that jump button is fucking powerful
[5:41:00] <%Valdorick> @Darkrenai The implication of the Renalla marriage is... yes, they were always the same person.
[5:41:03] <Midnight188> oh you jump the ground slams!
[5:41:03] <ElSuperNova> They got combined as punishment for the shattering
[5:41:09] <Profmcstevie> As I fight the once decrepit body of a god I consider.....I should not trust those fucking giant fingers
[5:41:12] <%notsoy> the leaping stomp you jumped too early
[5:41:12] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt worth mentioning Marika shattered the Elden Ring in grief after Godwyn's murder, but Godwyn was Marika and Godfrey's son, not Radagon's. So, there's another layer of Radagon not having any reason to want the ring broken.
[5:41:13] <%Valdorick> Hence why Ranni is an Empyrion.
[5:41:15] <$LucasifTheOdd> The lore for merika is real weird and slightly complex
[5:41:18] <+LandOfTheWay> @Darkrenai also not clear, but it seems as though marika split radagon off from her to deal with the carians, then they had different opinions about the Golden Order they served later
[5:41:20] <rudiciuscaesar> Oh so she's Merika's second husband?
[5:41:34] <tmvct1> @PatStaresAt Radagon can be scarlet rotted. Hallucigenia can't be.
[5:41:35] <%SaiyanShoto> Greg is doing his best
[5:41:35] <%dekkitout> It still casted, despite the death animation LUL
[5:41:35] <BigFingerRo> @PatStaresAt Would it be too smarmy to give you the same advice you give to Peach, about NOT trading hits with the boss?
[5:41:37] <doster504> bro killed him in time with the music
[5:41:38] <$EsotericOdyssey> @rudiciuscaesar yes
[5:41:40] <bepsistorm> BIOSLIME LIZARD ROUND 20 LET'S GOOOO
[5:41:40] <KatabolicRage> yeah death was not supposed to be a thing, and then her favourite son gets knife'd
[5:41:40] <boostergoldz> marika is radagon
[5:41:40] <rosabellamelantha> @rudiciuscaesar she is but she is also Marika's male half
[5:41:41] <%ScreamLord> Beat the creator of God
[5:41:43] <rudiciuscaesar> he's* whoops
[5:41:57] <rosabellamelantha> @rudiciuscaesar he* I mean
[5:42:03] <%earthboy2k> legendary pokémon looking ass
[5:42:13] <rudiciuscaesar> Thanks to everyone who caught me up, really appreciate that.
[5:42:16] <tmvct1> divine dragon
[5:42:21] <medril07> horse?
[5:42:25] <Frostydough1> man everyone being someone else makes this sound like kingdom hearts
[5:42:31] <Darkrenai> LUL
[5:42:31] <%Deft_Thought> Are those just a buncha Erdtrees?
[5:42:41] <Darkrenai> YO MARIKA GOT NORTED monkaS
[5:42:42] <beatie_g> its beta Arceus monkaS
[5:42:45] <tmvct1> Hydra move?
[5:42:51] <$sassyquatch963> about gondfrey, i kinda like how: as a grappler he has a sort of counter to co-operation w/ summons. yknow cause grapple animation immunity
[5:42:53] <Chaos_Aether> STOP RUNNING
[5:42:54] <zhenthrim213> no
[5:42:55] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @EsotericOdyssey That is also not super clear, since we found out that all of the black knives were Marikas servants
[5:42:55] <jubejube56> friggen bazelgeuse
[5:42:56] <Omenaire_> those are more erdtrees right?
[5:42:59] <Profmcstevie> A lot of these last few bosses have purely ground based attacks, the silly jumps do wonders
[5:43:00] <+stoatacious> this boss is a FUCK
[5:43:01] <iteruq> question is if they were always one person (maybe or numen are 2 ppl in 1) or did they became like this after marriage
[5:43:03] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> LUL
[5:43:07] <fishmonger555> which attempt is this?
[5:43:08] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt this boss was the low point of the game for me. Some of the attacks just suck.
[5:43:08] <%Bluwizard21> I don't remember him hurting this much, but I was wearing the veterans armor so maybe it had more holy resist?
[5:43:08] <%Valdorick> So... People kept saying that the stars are different from the Elden Ring... and I disagree with that... The Elden Ring and Golden Order IS a star... its the Sun itself.
[5:43:12] <rudiciuscaesar> good dodge
[5:43:13] <BigFingerRo> HE'S RECOVERING HEALTH?
[5:43:15] <+BoboDaHobo> gotta love that healing bug
[5:43:17] <+spottedwolf10> More running, less dodging
[5:43:21] <+Shoosler> yeah turns out it's hard explaining a story when you don't actually understand it to begin with. thus why everyone is referring to the the games story in metaphors
[5:43:34] <tmvct1> did pat do Malenia?
[5:43:41] <Lulu19> this boss Is amazing vibe is 10/10
[5:43:42] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Why does Pat never heal to full? Is there a trick to this?
[5:43:42] <coziestbank> @PatStaresAt Men are from Mars. Women are from Venus. Trust me I looked up the lore.
[5:43:44] <NewWillinium> Yep
[5:43:44] <Darkrenai> da greed monkaS
[5:43:45] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Sooo, from what I'm gathering Radagon and Marika are the same person but split, then later they boned and gave birth to Malenia and Miquelle, so like in some sort of self-incest they were fucked up, I guess?
[5:43:47] <+InhumanMilitia> Marika was an Empyrean who ascended to ruler of the Lands Between with the assistance of an Outer God: the Greater Will, and her chosen consort Godfrey, the first Elden Lord.  Marika had Godfrey lead a conquest, attacking neighboring kingdoms in an effort to expand the influence of the Greater Will. One of these wars was waged against the Fire Giants, whom met defeat when Marika slayed their god.
[5:43:47] <oda_flobunaga> THE BLACK BLADE RUNNING OUT IS A FEATURE  NOT A BUG
[5:43:47] <MagisterBanana> D-D-D-D-D-DOUBLE KILL
[5:43:48] <rudiciuscaesar> GREG WENT TOO NOOOO
[5:43:48] <+Drigoooooo> double kill
[5:43:48] <+stoatacious> metaphors are for cowards
[5:43:48] <boostergoldz> looks like ash lake
[5:43:49] <+donutmcbronut> @Valdorick I'm not too sure about that, since the Giants worshipped the sun and Marika tried to snuff out their eternal pyre
[5:43:50] <cyberjellyfist> You already beat Malenia, this is a cakewalk by comparison. You know this in your soul.
[5:43:50] <+LandOfTheWay> @tmvct1 yes
[5:43:53] <jubejube56> GREG NO
[5:43:53] <Khester824> holy negation talisman really helped me
[5:43:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> and Greg too NotLikeThis
[5:43:54] <+Shoosler> @PatStaresAt was the boss staggered there? there was a weak spot on it's belly
[5:43:55] <Sunstalker> Is it a healing bug? Just seems like UI fuckery cuz of the deathflame effect
[5:43:56] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Pretty sure The Elden tree is one huge Alchemy experiment by the Greater Will. Marika and Radagon being The Rebis and that it can mix things together and change things into other forms like with the crucible Knights and dragon warriors.
[5:43:57] <Crowroost> EB's moveset is so annoying when combined with an infinite azur stage
[5:43:59] <tmvct1> damn
[5:44:00] <$sassyquatch963> @BigFingerRo i believe the bloodfire or whatever he does actually can reduce max health, which can _look_ like healing
[5:44:00] <@Spydurman> can it rot?
[5:44:01] <ElSuperNova> Boi your greed is large
[5:44:02] <%captain_thickthighs> when I see that post all I see is the spirit form with lady eboshi shot that for a spirit
[5:44:03] <Omenaire_> erdtree ash lake
[5:44:04] <$LucasifTheOdd> First person I've seen not running godrick's great rune
[5:44:04] <+orochiblood> why are people dropping paragraphs in here
[5:44:06] <Komayeda> Legit beat this boss only cuz it glitched out and stood still for like, 35 seconds
[5:44:08] <beatie_g> just like bloodborne
[5:44:09] <@QueequegTheater> @BoboDaHobo not a bug
[5:44:12] <+InhumanMilitia> Marika and Godfrey had several children together. However, for reasons unknown, Godfrey was eventually hounded from the Lands Between. Marika would take Radagon as husband and King Consort. In truth, Radagon is Marika, the two being male/female halves of the same entity. Radagon would have several children with Rennala, and after Marika's "engagement" to Radagon, Marika would raise those children to their true demigod status.
[5:44:14] <HeroToxiko> the incest babies ruined it
[5:44:16] <Chaos_Aether> Is it me or does the beast sounds like its Cracking?
[5:44:19] <Parapattern> Just like Moon Presence
[5:44:23] <oda_flobunaga> @Komayeda same
[5:44:23] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> niw a s'niw
[5:44:25] <Omenaire_> the implications of the boss room are so beautiful
[5:44:26] <Zourath> @BigFingerRo Nah, Pat has a weapon that deals damage to max health.
[5:44:28] <zhenthrim213> a win is a win
[5:44:36] <BigFingerRo> @sassyquatch963 Oh, that fucked me up for a second there
[5:44:40] <Komayeda> heck yeah
[5:44:40] <%pabloelenano2> probably all the other trees are other worlds this thing fucked up
[5:44:43] <17sevens> so uh turns out elden ring is actually really fucking hard
[5:44:48] <KatabolicRage> Rennala got done dirty
[5:44:53] <Slattsquatch> There's an AI exploit that speedruns use against the Elden Beast where it just straight up doesn't attack
[5:44:59] <+BoboDaHobo> @QueequegTheater its not? he hit it with a blackflame attach and the things health went up
[5:45:04] <Komayeda> the other trees are Elden Ring Sequels
[5:45:04] <%SaiyanShoto> The names being so alike is one of the reasons the lore is hard for me to follow
[5:45:05] <purple9z> check your prayers for faith damage reduction, helped with my playthrough
[5:45:05] <leole11> @InhumanMilitia thanks for that :)
[5:45:06] <coziestbank> @KatabolicRage She kept the dog in the divorce.
[5:45:07] <@QueequegTheater> @BoboDaHobo No it didn't
[5:45:07] <+InhumanMilitia> Over time, Marika would grow disillusioned with the Greater Will. In defiance to her benefactor, Marika lifted her hammer and shattered the Elden Ring; while Radagon simultaneously tried, and failed, to repair it. Unable to remove Marika as its vassel, the Greater Will imprisioned her in the Erdtree along with Radagon, the two once more bound together in a single body.
[5:45:10] <+BoboDaHobo> attack*
[5:45:11] <+dudlerand> this first boss is "easy", but it becomes so aggravating when you're just anticipating that annoying ass elden beast fight
[5:45:11] <%Valdorick> @InhumanMilitia Godfrey's armor implies after the war with the Giants was done, that Godfrey was too. "The luster in his eyes had faded" after killing the Ice Giant king.
[5:45:23] <+vaderxyz1970> OMG is the moral of the story that the Greater Will alien couldnt understand love!?!
[5:45:27] <digaogrunge> BUFFS AND RESISTS
[5:45:28] <oda_flobunaga> So what's to over/under on Pat not actually beating the game tonight?
[5:45:29] <Midnight188> Rennala got cuck-divorced so her husband could marry himself. thats another level.
[5:45:30] <ElSuperNova> Cleanrot?
[5:45:32] <MavMedic81> Dlc is gonna be in space
[5:45:35] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Also add a Heal?
[5:45:35] <OverlordedK> just slap on that faith resist talisman bro
[5:45:38] <+spottedwolf10> If you use talisman that draws aggro on your mimic does it keep aggro more often?
[5:45:46] <%Samuy_JP> I love the theme of using the sword of Destined Death to fight these guys
[5:45:48] <tolloponik> is it really faith damage when the faith is to himself?
[5:45:50] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You should have PearlDrake TAlisman +2
[5:45:56] <%Valdorick> @Midnight188 Unlimited Catfish Work
[5:45:57] <purple9z> called lord's divine or something
[5:45:58] <+spottedwolf10> aggro talisman, summon mimic, quick switch
[5:46:00] <tolloponik> Ego damage?
[5:46:00] <CasualHardcoreTheater> Use the breath of ez to rot that celestial goo monster
[5:46:01] <%dekkitout> Ayo, Greg do a thing real quickl
[5:46:02] <Sunstalker> @InhumanMilitia Is that wher Nephali comes in? As a reason to why Godfrey split?
[5:46:14] <Crowroost> I stacked my Holy damage resist as high as it could get, still needed a player summon, AND STILL death-traded with Elden Beast in the end, the fight is just whack
[5:46:14] <coziestbank> Or Halig
[5:46:16] <+dudlerand> well that's GG
[5:46:18] <+LandOfTheWay> @Valdorick that "losing the luster in his eyes" thing is actually mentioned in one of marika's echoes, where she's talking to godfrey. it's made pretty clear she's referring to taking his grace away
[5:46:20] <%Mister_McDerp> wait so Rennala got double-cucked
[5:46:25] <NewWillinium> @InhumanMilitia Is Nephali his daughter or just one of his clan?
[5:46:26] <+donutmcbronut> Boost that holy damage negation!
[5:46:36] <TwistParabola> @InhumanMilitia i think part of his clan
[5:46:37] <+BoboDaHobo> @BoboDaHobo cant tell if joking or what but I'm too lazy to pull the clip
[5:46:38] <%dekkitout> Would be nuts
[5:46:39] <BigBruthaThunda> u can rot radagon
[5:46:40] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt NO ROT
[5:46:41] <coziestbank> Isn't Rot an opposing Alien?
[5:46:44] <+Con_fusedDX> I had to switch from holy to fire damage for this fight
[5:46:46] <+donutmcbronut> @Mister_McDerp Yeah basically, that's why Ranni did all the stuff she did
[5:46:46] <$LucasifTheOdd> I assume pat's done the haligtree area?
[5:46:49] <%Valdorick> Basically, the Golden Order is fucked and broken, and that shit needs to go...
[5:46:50] <Profmcstevie> Foolish space worm, I can build to negate your damage type
[5:46:51] <oda_flobunaga> U Rot NOT
[5:46:52] <Parapattern> The Elden Bussy
[5:46:58] <%Bluwizard21> Well radagon is a crumbling rock, and elden beast doesn't look like it has an actual body
[5:47:00] <%dekkitout> OH GOD
[5:47:01] <%Bluwizard21> OMG
[5:47:06] <%NBUsagi> HOLY FUCK THE ROT
[5:47:09] <%Willowight> holy
[5:47:10] <%dekkitout> Lore wise, where is rot from?
[5:47:11] <Midnight188> ROT FTW!
[5:47:11] <TwistParabola> YEAH
[5:47:12] <%Bluwizard21> Rot and black flame
[5:47:17] <%Mister_McDerp> HOLY SHIT
[5:47:19] <%justcallmebobplease> Turns out Malenia could've solod the whoooole game.
[5:47:19] <Ner234> THE ROT CLAIM ALL
[5:47:19] <+eanscrale> Hello from one outer god to the other
[5:47:20] <coziestbank> Lilith really don't like Adam
[5:47:21] <%Willowight> rot god
[5:47:23] <+Grayhammatter> holy shit
[5:47:24] <+donutmcbronut> @dekkitout Another outer god
[5:47:24] <Sigma_190_Beta> @dekkitout It's also an Outer God.
[5:47:26] <%ScreamLord> The Rot IS from an Empyrean Demigod
[5:47:28] <+vaderxyz1970> MELANIA IS THE MOST TOXIC SHIT TO ALL GODS
[5:47:32] <%Bluwizard21> @dekkitout Our theory is incest
[5:47:35] <superzebra101> praise nurgle for the rot
[5:47:38] <%anoldtoilet> @dekkitout a Rot Goddess that was sealed away somewhere and then it got reincarnated inside of Malenia
[5:47:38] <RubberFistFight> @dekkitout it's one of the 6 outer gods
[5:47:41] <Crowroost> Rot, God.
[5:47:47] <HeroToxiko> blood flame is the best
[5:47:57] <%Valdorick> Ranni is, by rights, a direct heir of Mariaka, and first in line for the Elden Throne. Explains why she's so deep in the... uh... game of thrones.
[5:47:57] <%Deft_Thought> Who needs Rot when you've got Destined Death at your side
[5:48:02] <%dekkitout> @Bluwizard21 Got it, moon presence Kappa
[5:48:04] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> HE'S BLEEDING?!
[5:48:14] <tolloponik> wow rot really pissed him of
[5:48:16] <wdga> you dare rot me
[5:48:17] <Omenaire_> rad bro cmon!
[5:48:21] <%Deft_Thought> Puttin the Rad in Radagon right now
[5:48:22] <%Nekros4442> Enraged?
[5:48:22] <%ScreamLord> I saw you minmaxing
[5:48:24] <Slattsquatch> That's rad(agon)
[5:48:25] <ape_hawk> did pat forget to use his physics plask again?
[5:48:27] <Calek> if we fight the Rot God in the DLC I'm quitting video games
[5:48:27] <ElSuperNova> Raddy Daddy
[5:48:28] <%Nekros4442> dude just sped up like crazy
[5:48:28] <oda_flobunaga> Cool
[5:48:28] <+vaderxyz1970> Go Greg!
[5:48:29] <CptHarlok> Mimic got your back
[5:48:30] <Ner234> He's popping off
[5:48:37] <Midnight188> but can SPACE ALIEN be Rotted?!
[5:48:53] <%cade_calrayn> doesn't look like it
[5:49:00] <cyberjellyfist> these last few bosses are very souls-bornelike. You get the most bang for your buck by staying on top if them aggressively,
[5:49:02] <+LandOfTheWay> @anoldtoilet where's reincarnation mentioned? didn't see that in any of the malenia-related items i looked up
[5:49:08] <Sunstalker> Breathe attacks almost always double hitting you is just the worst design
[5:49:13] <HexMasterMike> Is that rot ability on the ash on the sword or a separate thing?
[5:49:13] <%baka_sugoi> LET'S GO GREEEEEG
[5:49:16] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> You might. It didnt  land all the way
[5:49:17] <jubejube56> But if you bring rot the mimic will use it for phase 2
[5:49:17] <Midnight188> no rot for AYYYY LMAO
[5:49:19] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Rolled 8nto the fire again lol
[5:49:19] <digaogrunge> NEVER BUFFED THO
[5:49:22] <Crowroost> But can space alien be Frosted tm
[5:49:25] <%dekkitout> Is it rot immune or highly resistant SeriousSloth
[5:49:27] <TrollKing96> Can you jump over some of Radagon's and the Elden Beast's attacks?
[5:49:32] <MagisterBanana> Bet you that fucker's immune
[5:49:38] <CasualHardcoreTheater> You can rot him you have to hit him more cause of his resistance
[5:49:39] <leole11> breath attacks hitting you twice is purposeful design, to teach you not to be hit by breath attacks
[5:49:43] <%furiousfurioso> I popped the infinite FP physick, ran under it, and did the astel meteor and it disintegrated LUL
[5:49:44] <%Mister_McDerp> so if the gods are aliens is this secretly Bloodborne 2?
[5:49:52] <Midnight188> I think you can jump and avoid the ground bursts
[5:49:52] <ElSuperNova> Is he using the physick flask?
[5:49:53] <Zourath> @HexMasterMike It's an incantation.
[5:49:54] <zhenthrim213> @Crowroost i believe the speedrun record guy did tht
[5:49:56] <%Willowight> we all love greg
[5:49:59] <MagisterBanana> HE'S NOT IMMUNE?
[5:50:03] <%Dew217> I love Greg
[5:50:04] <%Valdorick> @Mister_McDerp Yes
[5:50:05] <%SaiyanShoto> I wann sub to Greg
[5:50:07] <+Grayhammatter> he loves greg
[5:50:07] <%dekkitout> @Mister_McDerp I'm gambling in that corner
[5:50:10] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @LandOfTheWay I don't know abou reincarnation but the dex talisman i think says that the rot god was sealed inside someone
[5:50:11] <AngryAsian5> GET EM GREG
[5:50:11] <%SaiyanShoto> *Wanna
[5:50:20] <+5Two> Greg is just Peach co-oping with you.
[5:50:39] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> can ppl confirm if you used the aggro talisman on greg if they would only target greg?
[5:50:44] <LeafarOz> that's wide holy heck
[5:50:48] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt I went in with a combo of fire breath and ice breath and used whichever one the mimic wasn't using to keep the frost procc coming
[5:50:48] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[5:50:52] <%anoldtoilet> @LandOfTheWay i dont rememberall of them but the scarlet aeonia spell is some of it. its like transforming her into the rot goddess, but the lore in the blue dancer talisman says the rot goddess is ancient, so malenia is becoming the avatar of something or reincarnating or something
[5:50:52] <+InhumanMilitia> @NewWillinium the last of the clan i believe and if from what i believe gidion killed the remaining tribes man to keep godfrey away because he didnt want someone strong enough to fix the ring following merikas will
[5:50:54] <digaogrunge> GREG BUFFED SO SMART
[5:50:55] <OverlordedK> the greed
[5:50:55] <%Valdorick> Yeah don't uh... aggro the boss while Greg is stunlocked
[5:50:55] <BigFingerRo> FUCK BRO
[5:51:05] <Gorgs7> rot was working on phase 1 btw
[5:51:06] <$Futurecity10> Its funny cause rune arcs are worthless here
[5:51:08] <jubejube56> Maybe the Golden Order had a point
[5:51:08] <%Dew217> We didnt love Greg Enough
[5:51:09] <%Bluwizard21> Fightin two gods in a row is pretty hard
[5:51:09] <coziestbank> @PatStaresAt Would Shabriri's Woe work on greg
[5:51:10] <thekrameshow> hoarfrost stomp worked great for me
[5:51:15] <%anoldtoilet> iEach time the scarlet flower blooms, Malenia's rot advances. It has bloomed twice already. With the third bloom, she will become a true goddess.
[5:51:20] <ElSuperNova> @thekrameshow THIS
[5:51:23] <+FackinCrazy> Ice+bleed is super strong
[5:51:41] <Midnight188> Hoarfrost Stomp may as well be Super Ice
[5:51:41] <+spottedwolf10> Hit him with a pot, he hates pots
[5:51:42] <%anoldtoilet> The dancer in blue represents a fairy, who in legend bestowed a flowing sword upon a blind swordsman. Blade in hand, the swordsman sealed away an ancient god — a god that was Rot itself.
[5:51:43] <+Pleblu> Gregg wants baileys
[5:51:47] <RubberFistFight> "honey don't leave your radagon out over night, it'll get all rotten."
[5:51:58] <%dekkitout> Ref, I challenge that last hit
[5:52:07] <%Valdorick> @anoldtoilet  General Radahn was the second time it bloomed, meaning you fought a Rot Goddess when she became a butterfly
[5:52:12] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, did Pat basically poison Jesus?
[5:52:23] <%Willowight> ironically ice melts him
[5:52:26] <RubberFistFight> @dekkitout Referee Ziyamaki: "it was legit, challenge overruled."
[5:52:29] <ElSuperNova> Big DMG
[5:52:29] <%Kevlar_Caviar> jesus all this lore stuff in the chat LUL i love it
[5:52:30] <oda_flobunaga> Yeah, Ice do it
[5:52:31] <%justcallmebobplease> Hey chat, please rec me some innate bleed weapons you can stick Hoarfrost stomp on - ideally ones you can poke out from behind a shield.
[5:52:37] <+LandOfTheWay> @anoldtoilet oh wow, i totally missed that in the blue dancer talisman. thanks!
[5:52:41] <+lagmar99> Wouldn't ice first work better since theu take more damage after it pops?
[5:52:45] <$LucasifTheOdd> I love how this music really feels like a final fight, not the usual dark souls thing where the final fight just feels like a victory lap
[5:52:48] <TrollKing96> I found out the Elden Beast's subtitle: Order Incarnate, Vassal of the Greater Will
[5:52:51] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @anoldtoilet Radahn was the first, the second time is on the room before her boss fight
[5:52:54] <%Willowight> physic
[5:52:59] <Sunstalker> @justcallmebobplease Cross-Naginata?
[5:53:02] <doster504> Timed to the music again
[5:53:08] <bassoontyphoon> Let’s go greg!!!!!
[5:53:13] <kingmemelord97> hey chat am i just tired and my eyes playing tricks on me or is the health bar jumping back and forth ?
[5:53:17] <%dekkitout> @TrollKing96 From an item desc, or from another localization?
[5:53:27] <sirrice77> @justcallmebobplease cross naginata
[5:53:31] <Calek> @kingmemelord97 maximum health is being reduced
[5:53:35] <ElSuperNova> @kingmemelord97 Max HP reduction effect
[5:53:36] <%Dew217> LETS GO GREG
[5:53:40] <zhenthrim213> @kingmemelord97 its the death blade
[5:53:42] <doster504> @kingmemelord97 the debuff his sword applies reduces max health so it makes the health bar do some whacky shit
[5:53:47] <MagisterBanana> GREG NOOO
[5:53:53] <RubberFistFight> @kingmemelord97 there's a bug to that effect that some people are trying to pass off as "copium" on the part of "casuals".
[5:53:54] <oda_flobunaga> @kingmemelord97 its because of the Blade of death effect which reduces the enemy health bars for like 20 seconds then resets
[5:54:08] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i love how its tail looks like roots
[5:54:11] <%SaiyanShoto> Greg Greg Greg Greg
[5:54:12] <%Kevlar_Caviar> and also a shark
[5:54:15] <%justcallmebobplease> If Cross Naginata still retains shieldpoke rules AND is viable for Hoarfrost Stomp that's fantastic, thank you!
[5:54:18] <+Grayhammatter> greg just eating shit
[5:54:18] <%dekkitout> Greg's fine monkaS
[5:54:19] <Yakobro> @RubberFistFight it's literally his weapon dot... lmao
[5:54:21] <Sunstalker> Where does the Lake of Rot come from actually? Is it where the rot flower came from or is the lake a result from the flower blooming up in the lands between?
[5:54:21] <+Horosho> so is it actually healing the boss at all with the blade of death effect?
[5:54:22] <%JoshManVGH> Gregg carrying this team!
[5:54:25] <%Dew217> I love GREG COME ON
[5:54:26] <Profmcstevie> Forgive me greg, the holy light chose you
[5:54:30] <MagisterBanana> CRUCIFIED
[5:54:30] <%captain_thickthighs> got to love how at Eldridge alien still knows to use a sort for the aesthetic
[5:54:31] <%dekkitout> D:
[5:54:31] <+Rofiarf> i have never seen that move
[5:54:32] <+Grayhammatter> yoooooo@
[5:54:33] <Crowroost> This boss is really just "What if Ludwig had infinite space, but could fly and had spells and was awful"
[5:54:34] <AngryAsian5> GODDAMN
[5:54:35] <mr_dream__> that grab is sick
[5:54:36] <%murdocismyhero> Omnislash

[5:54:38] <%anoldtoilet> holy fuck
[5:54:38] <NewWillinium> I always expect that move to do more damage
[5:54:39] <%notsoy> scooped
[5:54:39] <%anoldtoilet> lol
[5:54:39] <Augus7717> oh this grab FUCKS LUL
[5:54:40] <zhenthrim213> ive never seen tht
[5:54:40] <+spottedwolf10> Once I get the mimic tear on my sorc build I'll no longer get one shotted in boss fights, just two shotted
[5:54:41] <+Grayhammatter> that grab was cool
[5:54:41] <%Deft_Thought> That was anime as hell
[5:54:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> Greg is the real protagonist
[5:54:41] <%SaiyanShoto> YOOO
[5:54:42] <V0LK__> that was hardcore O_O'
[5:54:42] <coziestbank> CRUCKED
[5:54:42] <TwistParabola> you lived!
[5:54:43] <b_ikki> that was cool i didnt know it was a grab
[5:54:44] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> GREG NO!
[5:54:45] <$LucasifTheOdd> That's my favourite boss move in the entire game
[5:54:45] <tolloponik> so that's what happened to Marika
[5:54:47] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I didn't know he had a grab
[5:54:47] <sirrice77> @justcallmebobplease yeah you shield poke with it and hoarfrost should work since it says it works on all melee weapons
[5:54:49] <%Niney_Who> YEYEYEYEEY
[5:54:51] <LuminusVows> it just healed?
[5:54:52] <TheBlankAce> Holy shit rune crusifiction
[5:54:52] <ElSuperNova> That shit's cool
[5:54:53] <Clyderso> HITBOXES
[5:54:54] <%Dew217> THAT GRAB IS SOOOO
[5:54:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> you are merely a vessel for the Greg
[5:54:55] <BigFingerRo> @MagisterBanana You mean CROSSIFYED
[5:54:57] <cavefishes> music kicks ass here too
[5:54:59] <TwistParabola> HITBOW
[5:55:01] <TwistParabola> BOX
[5:55:04] <oda_flobunaga> In DS3 the effect was only usable by enemies against the player.  It looks jank here because the size of enemy health bars is static
[5:55:11] <+Grayhammatter> greg nooooo
[5:55:12] <%Valdorick> Greg NOOOOOOOOO
[5:55:13] <thekrameshow> u got this

[5:57:17] <+OneGorillionDollars> @PatStaresAt you know I think it's really fitting you are using that sword to beat the game
[5:57:17] <AngryAsian5> Getting closer
[5:57:18] <+dudlerand> I 100% thought that was it damn
[5:57:19] <Shockmaster182> NOOOOOOOOOOOO
[5:57:19] <Solidus_113> you can outrun those tracking shots from just sprinting
[5:57:19] <+spottedwolf10> First try
[5:57:20] <+tetraes> the boss arena is pretty
[5:57:22] <SuperButterBuns> you can get that space lizard pat i believe
[5:57:22] <cavefishes> if you just sprint sidewyas all those vertical shots will miss you
[5:57:24] <DuckAlfred> YOU GOT THIS
[5:57:24] <+WutangchickeN> woolieMINHLEE woolieMINHLEE woolieMINHLEE

[5:57:27] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU GOT THIS
[5:57:28] <%Agami23> so im just tunning in and i feel like i missed some stuff
[5:57:28] <RyuuAoi> That was fucking impressive pat!
[5:57:33] <BigFingerRo> SHIT
[5:57:34] <Crowroost> Damn the boss actually stood still and was able to be hit for 10 seconds there
[5:57:34] <%Kevlar_Caviar> THIS BOSS is why a sl1 run is practically impossible LUL
[5:57:36] <$realm_forge> Hail the REAL Elden lord….Greg
[5:57:37] <+Pookiedaexzile> THrow Rocks
[5:57:40] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> BARRICADE SHIELD
[5:57:43] <Shockmaster182> LIFT YOUR SKINNY RUNES LIKE ANTENNEAS TO HEAVEN
[5:57:44] <%justcallmebobplease> @Sunstalker I want to see the vids of people inevitably doing it, just to see HOW.  How cleanly must you exploit each move's hitboxing?
[5:57:46] <SIydoc> pat put a heal spell on for greg to use
[5:57:47] <sendart> longer range spell might be useful
[5:57:50] <+Drigoooooo> yeah if you keep running you will outrun them
[5:57:51] <$LucasifTheOdd> didn't someone already SL1 the game?
[5:57:54] <+spottedwolf10> sideways and towards?
[5:58:02] <%captain_thickthighs> I'm surprised not no horse in the large void
[5:58:17] <leole11> Radagon Fight > Elden Beast Fight
[5:58:19] <cavefishes> no horse ahead
[5:58:21] <leole11> I love this fight
[5:58:22] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @LucasifTheOdd people are STARTING sl1 runs but as far as i know no one has completed one yet
[5:58:32] <wdga> lot of big stompys here at the end
[5:58:33] <$sassyquatch963> i love seeing greg come in from the side with a jump attack
[5:58:44] <+InhumanMilitia> yeah last boss is a keep away coward and no horse to close the gap
[5:59:01] <cavefishes> look at your greg - now back to me - now back at your greg
[5:59:08] <+lagmar99> cleaaaan phase 1
[5:59:14] <Profmcstevie> Of course an impossibly power Elder Beast....is a zoner smh
[5:59:14] <ElSuperNova> EZ Clap
[5:59:20] <+GunToad> buff bottllle
[5:59:33] <%dekkitout> Beefy buff time
[5:59:38] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i want a fromsoft fighting game with THIS as the super secret character
[5:59:39] <SuperButterBuns> odd how the god of the universe has alot of health seems sus
[5:59:43] <+Rofiarf> random heals
[5:59:45] <jubejube56> I mean tbf Elden Lord Pat is basically a zoner with extra steps
[5:59:47] <RubberFistFight> by the end of this you're gonna be doing the same as the genichiro phase in isshin, just completely avoiding everything and getting perfect hits.
[5:59:51] <jubejube56> this is just a projectile war
[5:59:58] <RubberFistFight> Radagon's gonna have nothing
[6:00:03] <XxMoliciousxX> really looks like he has the nameless king's crown
[6:00:09] <+Rofiarf> lol
[6:00:11] <Darkrenai> LUL
[6:00:14] <ElSuperNova> LAME IT OUT
[6:00:18] <zhenthrim213> it does it at helth intervals
[6:00:40] <+dearghostss> greg not into jumping it seems
[6:00:53] <oda_flobunaga> Holy Damage Negation Batman
[6:00:55] <Sunstalker> This really looks like it's not gonna be fun for my morningstar and probably the reason why the lead up to this throws projectile boss weapons at you to collect
[6:00:56] <%dekkitout> Imagine if Greg rots this fool
[6:01:00] <digaogrunge> WE KNOW
[6:01:16] <NewWillinium> . . Oh man Plague is going to HATE this boss
[6:01:26] <%Deft_Thought> When's Wondrous Flask
[6:01:31] <Crowroost> This boss really feels like they dreamed up the animation and spectacle first, realized that'd require an infinite stage, then just put it in with no actual testing
[6:01:31] <KobeTeeth90> this guy wouldnt be so stronge if u didnt talk to him all the time
[6:01:50] <%dekkitout> Huh, it's all scuffed and cracked up
[6:01:54] <OverlordedK> I wish elden stars was as good as that when we used it
[6:02:07] <%Willowight> sword makes such a loud clang against water
[6:02:20] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Get Boss Stats
[6:02:23] <oda_flobunaga> This stage actually does have an edge BTW
[6:02:29] <%Monkeyweed21> well you arent a god tree
[6:02:32] <BigBruthaThunda> it because you don't have the right
[6:02:39] <tolloponik> is this what those crystal guys were trying to become?
[6:02:39] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> If you run in circles that will 100% miss
[6:02:39] <cavefishes> yeah elden beast has 99 faith
[6:02:48] <cavefishes> you've got like 55?

[6:08:38] <%Agami23> the grinding blade
[6:08:38] <%dekkitout> It looks like the coil sword
[6:08:39] <WillSin4Cash> the farm sword
[6:08:40] <MagisterBanana> Did you talk to Master Hewg before that happened to him?
[6:08:44] <rosabellamelantha> @RubberFistFight no? did you not talk to Ranni she specifically said her end would keep the gods from meddling with the humans how is that bad?
[6:08:44] <%dcentii> farm sword
[6:08:45] <+5Two> Almost half way there.
[6:08:46] <+swesterly> that was objectively the good ending and frees the tarnished from the yoke of the greater will, literal space transcendence
[6:08:49] <$LucasifTheOdd> aka farm sword
[6:08:49] <%SveriSageAdvice> you know Paige is gonna want that hammer lol
[6:08:52] <CptHarlok> Also known as sword of farming
[6:08:53] <cavefishes> wave of gold is a proper meme
[6:08:53] <zhenthrim213> @PatStaresAt it looks like the coiled sword
[6:08:54] <%Valdorick> I'm glad From let end game boss weapons be stupid strong.
[6:08:56] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> the real elden ring were the friends we made along the way
[6:08:57] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt The wave of Gold is a super farm skill for that Blood Palace area
[6:08:57] <IvanMistwalker> YOU MISSED EMD CREDITS CUTSCENE
[6:08:57] <@DakotaMacDoodle> sword good
[6:08:58] <ElSuperNova> LONGINOUS SWORD

[6:09:12] <%robotoken> new game +?
[6:09:13] <$SGrim> What is the drip of an eElden Lord?
[6:09:18] <Evendrag> Grappler Pat
[6:09:19] <$LucasifTheOdd> I'd say the best ending is possibly the one where you're the lord but also restore death to the cycle allowing people to be freed from it
[6:09:20] <DazzlingFuhrer> There's no end credits cutscene for that ending.
[6:09:20] <senfood> I'm looking very forward to the DLC where you fight all of the outer gods.
[6:09:21] <%Maids4lyfe> there isn't one
[6:09:22] <Midnight188> is there a post-credits cutscene or is this One Guy Big Lie
[6:09:22] <rosabellamelantha> I don't know how people are taking "the gods won't meddle on the earth anymore" as something bad
[6:09:23] <fehraf> why is it a wig?
[6:09:24] <sweetkek> You are GOLD Always believe in your soul
[6:09:26] <genmypoweralready> You missed it, Solaire shows up and kills Ranni it's fucking sick

[6:09:34] <+ArmoredAnathema> Zubaz armor
[6:09:34] <+orochiblood> One Guy'd again lmao'
[6:09:39] <%kewlmyc> Why is it always liar?
[6:09:40] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight because "the stars" are literally the monster things you were fighting under the map? They're not good either and are implied to be the pawns of one of the 6 outer gods, can't remember which.
[6:09:41] <Omenaire_> now THATS an elden lord
[6:09:42] <ExpressNode> This aint a marvel movie
[6:09:43] <luciluxlu0> only for the frenzy ending

[6:09:53] <MagisterBanana> Hewg....
[6:09:54] <+swesterly> @LucasifTheOdd the order of life and death and the cycle of souls was literally the tyranny of the greater will but ok
[6:09:55] <ElSuperNova> another dex greatsword lul
[6:09:56] <genmypoweralready> What a cool sword
[6:09:56] <%Agami23> ah, you dont have the dex to show the bullshit attack
[6:09:57] <cavefishes> weapon art does a funny
[6:09:58] <%SlimmieP> All that to look like Tusk from Killer Instinct
[6:10:01] <Memitim> time to respec to dex

[6:10:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> now we can finally start the game
[6:10:18] <rosabellamelantha> @RubberFistFight Ranni outright says in her chamber she's keeping those AWAY from the world did you not hear her
[6:10:18] <%dcentii> All the empyreans + mohg seem to have been affected by outer gods
[6:10:20] <$Wisconsinite> now we play the game

[6:10:47] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> now pat's gonna get really into invasions
[6:10:47] <%anoldtoilet> ranni lies to you lol
[6:10:48] <Memitim> There are a few Faith/Dex weapons
[6:10:50] <IvanMistwalker> Dex gets really good
[6:10:51] <ElSuperNova> Wave of Gold?
[6:10:51] <rosabellamelantha> @RubberFistFight that is not what she said that is a romantic prose meaning the certainties of the order will no longer apply
[6:10:56] <%SaiyanShoto> Dex gets the cool looking shit
[6:10:56] <%dcentii> Malenia with outer god of rot, Miquella with whatever he got, Mogh with outergod of blood and Ranni with outergod of Stars/moon
[6:10:56] <oda_flobunaga> Except you can literally make dex faith weapons with Ashes of war
[6:10:56] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt That's the problem, though. It IS the FINAL weapon.
[6:10:57] <wdga> i mean people probably want that weapon....before the literal end boss
[6:10:58] <+Con_fusedDX> halo scythe is one of the best weapons and it's faith dex
[6:11:02] <Omenaire_> 14 strength
[6:11:02] <%kewlmyc> Wait, there's going to be DLC?
[6:11:07] <CapCasual> How many hours is the save at right now?
[6:11:10] <%Valdorick> Get all the damage for all that Farming
[6:11:10] <Crowroost> Prep for the DLC i say
[6:11:12] <Zebroneath> yeah, who cares?
[6:11:14] <%Monkeyweed21> I love that there are dex greatswords and colossal weapons
[6:11:15] <%Kevlar_Caviar> LUL
[6:11:18] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> sucks
[6:11:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> Large Number
[6:11:22] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Ranni looks to the stars, when the stars fucked up the world at least twice. And isn't that how Bloodborne begins?
[6:11:25] <LuminusVows> No strength?
[6:11:27] <%Valdorick> Pat going FULL FARM
[6:11:28] <%JoshManVGH> How many more Lunar Tears you got?
[6:11:29] <rudiciuscaesar> LMAO
[6:11:30] <%MaybeFalco> imagine if the whole game up until this point was a cold open
[6:11:30] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @kewlmyc not confirmed but let's be honest they're gonna do it
[6:11:31] <%Felhad> lol, that hp
[6:11:35] <+SaintSalted> wow this build SUCKS
[6:11:35] <Crowroost> Nice health bar LUL
[6:11:35] <%Valdorick> DLC will come out, and he'll be 99 in all stats
[6:11:36] <rudiciuscaesar> the HP
[6:11:36] <%TheGreatSkenardo> @CapCasual either 69 or 420
[6:11:37] <+FalconFlavoredPunch> HP GO DOWN
[6:11:37] <%SaiyanShoto> Gotta get ready for the DLC
[6:11:37] <%anoldtoilet> lol vigor dropping ftw
[6:11:37] <+Rofiarf> time to grind
[6:11:39] <%LaughingCatt> smol hp
[6:11:40] <+boomstarprime> the weapon art is crazy
[6:11:42] <%anoldtoilet> THE BADASS BUIOLD
[6:11:42] <+SaintSalted> how dare you
[6:11:42] <+heiro001> one hit wonder
[6:11:43] <Ner234> HP: GONE
[6:11:43] <%anoldtoilet> LETS GO
[6:11:44] <CptHarlok> Hardcore mode I suppose
[6:11:44] <%dcentii> @PatStaresAt go to rune farm and use weapon art
[6:11:45] <+terry_quest> dont get hit
[6:11:49] <tolloponik> glass cannon build
[6:11:50] <genmypoweralready> HP is for losers just don't get hit
[6:11:50] <%Mister_McDerp> who needs hp LUL
[6:11:50] <$SGrim> 15 Vigor, GO TO NG+
[6:11:52] <Evendrag> go to moghwyns
[6:11:52] <Memitim> who needs health
[6:11:55] <MagisterBanana> HP don't matter if you don't get hit
[6:11:56] <rudiciuscaesar> the ultimate glass cannon
[6:11:57] <%Agami23> i do wish there was more faith/dex though. my brother played most of the game with a uchi buffing it
[6:11:59] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Go to that grinding spot in BLood Palace for maximum effect
[6:12:06] <+heiro001> blueblood sword
[6:12:06] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> SORESEAL
[6:12:09] <RubberFistFight> @rosabellamelantha one of her quotes is literally "And have the certainties of sight, emotion, faith, and touch...All become impossibilities." in the context of that being one of her primary goals.
[6:12:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O it's a sword
[6:12:17] <+FalconFlavoredPunch> BIG DMG
[6:12:18] <rosabellamelantha> People really just HAVE to come up with a reason ranni is actually bad and I'm so tired of it
[6:12:29] <%anoldtoilet> because shes actually bad
[6:12:31] <Augus7717> you do have HUGE STATS
[6:12:32] <$SGrim> THAT RANGE
[6:12:34] <%anoldtoilet> the only reason shes good is "im horny tho"
[6:12:39] <cavefishes> so that wave goes for like a mile
[6:12:43] <%TheGreatSkenardo> That's a Big Boi
[6:12:44] <$sassyquatch963> @PatStaresAt dont forget gold scarab
[6:12:46] <IvanMistwalker> Ranni is best Waifu
[6:12:48] <+Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt you can ratchet this grind up to 51K a swing
[6:12:48] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @anoldtoilet your point?
[6:12:49] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> @rosabellamelantha I dont trust someone with that many arms
[6:12:50] <+heiro001> damn
[6:12:50] <cavefishes> yeah it'll go all the way down the hill
[6:12:51] <%dcentii> she did stage the plan to kill godwyn
[6:12:52] <%baka_sugoi> YEYEYEYEYE
[6:12:52] <NewWillinium> Fuuuuuuuuuuck
[6:12:53] <MagisterBanana> She's bad and I am here for it
[6:12:53] <TheQuadrupleS> Thats just Faith Light Greatsword
[6:12:53] <mrtanaka111> @rosabellamelantha calm down lol
[6:12:54] <%anoldtoilet> ranni doesnt even look like that, thats a puppet shaped like her ice witch alien mentor
[6:12:54] <%NBUsagi> Well fuck
[6:12:55] <%JoshManVGH> FUCK!
[6:12:56] <Zebroneath> well then
[6:12:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> wow
[6:12:57] <+terry_quest> wtf
[6:12:57] <RubberFistFight> @rosabellamelantha Blame the dialogue that gives that impression, strongly.
[6:12:59] <+Shoosler> that's sick!
[6:12:59] <%notsoy> LMFAO holy shit
[6:13:00] <oda_flobunaga> JESUS CHRIST
[6:13:00] <ElSuperNova> WELP
[6:13:01] <rosabellamelantha> @RubberFistFight Bro she's literally talking about that in the context of the order of the world
[6:13:02] <rudiciuscaesar> wtf?
[6:13:04] <+FlappySeal_> they had a family
[6:13:04] <%TheGreatSkenardo> I see.
[6:13:04] <LuminusVows> welp
[6:13:05] <MagisterBanana> FAST
[6:13:05] <+seaearthandsky> yep
[6:13:07] <Augus7717> yeah that thing fucks LUL
[6:13:09] <%captain_thickthighs> God damn
[6:13:09] <+orochiblood> Can people stop being weird about Ranni, yall annoying
[6:13:09] <%dcentii> that just goes doesnt it
[6:13:11] <$LucasifTheOdd> combine with golden scarab and the item
[6:13:11] <TwistParabola> YEAH
[6:13:11] <%NBUsagi> God Sword
[6:13:14] <ElSuperNova> SIGMA LORD
[6:13:14] <+Pookiedaexzile> Balanced
[6:13:14] <Paperware> time for genocide
[6:13:15] <%Monkeyweed21> WE MUSOU NOW
[6:13:17] <Crowroost> Religion doing what it do
[6:13:25] <%JoshManVGH> "So I did a little grinding off screen..."
[6:13:27] <genmypoweralready> Is there a gun
[6:13:28] <+Kyma1020> no Dragonlord?
[6:13:30] <+M0untain_wolf> Faith broken?
[6:13:39] <%Bluwizard21> Whelp was fun, I'ma go back a stream and watch you fight Malenia
[6:13:39] <CptHarlok> @rosabellamelantha Kinda stupid considering there are no "happy" endings in any of the souls games.  It's all either revolution or continuation of corruption and decay.
[6:13:43] <%kittenby> My name will never be said right by anyone.
[6:13:45] <Evendrag> So, 2nd playthrough confirmed? @patstaresat
[6:13:46] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight "look, her wanting to take away your sight and your ability to feel is a good thing, actually" lol ok. I mean I'm picking Ranni's ending too because she's cool but ok.
[6:13:47] <mrtanaka111> theres a handcannon
[6:13:48] <Zebroneath> Pat's finally free from Elden streams
[6:13:50] <%Valdorick> @Kyma1020 He already did Dragonlord.
[6:13:53] <%FalconFlavoredPunch> FalconFlavoredPunch subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! thanks for BIG SWORD
[6:13:54] <%Nekros4442> oh did Pat not do Dragonlord?
[6:13:55] <$LucasifTheOdd> 177
[6:13:58] <Omenaire_> good job pat
[6:13:58] <%Bluwizard21> @Kyma1020 he beat the dragonlord
[6:13:59] <%AHomeschoolDropout> WOOOO
[6:14:00] <Memitim> we are the Elden Ring
[6:14:02] <TwistParabola> YAY
[6:14:03] <UltimateFloofyBoi> so she was dead the whole time
[6:14:03] <AngryAsian5> WE DID IIITTTT
[6:14:04] <%dcentii> everything besides strength seems to be broken, while strength is just "strong"
[6:14:04] <cavefishes> YOU DEID IT
[6:14:05] <+Javaa01> And it only took 120 hours
[6:14:07] <CptHarlok> Grats Pat
[6:14:07] <genmypoweralready> Order is an unironic good ending
[6:14:08] <leole11> i also finished the game at 177
[6:14:09] <%Valdorick> Pat did Dragonlord!
[6:14:10] <bleugh> we did it together :)
[6:14:11] <Trace_Bovier> final time?
[6:14:13] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> the elden ring were the friends we made along the way
[6:14:14] <+Kyma1020> cool I 'll see later
[6:14:16] <%GingaNZ> psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab
[6:14:16] <%SaiyanShoto> Greg did it!
[6:14:16] <rudiciuscaesar> Now Pat will finally get that tattoo
[6:14:16] <%JoshManVGH> G A M E  O V E R
[6:14:16] <%Cozy90> RATE THE GAME
[6:14:19] <%Dew217> Good Stream Pat Im gald I saw the end
[6:14:19] <oda_flobunaga> @Nekros4442 he did
[6:14:20] <$sassyquatch963> time to wait for the spoilercast
[6:14:20] <Chaos_Aether> The age of fire can begin
[6:14:21] <%Kouseo> Kouseo is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 6 in the channel! 
[6:14:22] <%kittenby> Go to bed?
[6:14:22] <kazadog> order ending is the chad ending
[6:14:22] <%Kouseo> Kouseo gifted a Tier 1 sub to Wheelskelet10! 
[6:14:22] <Midnight188> wish that the Moon was always in the sky post that ending
[6:14:23] <MagisterBanana> Redo it as SL1 Wretch
[6:14:24] <rosabellamelantha> @CptHarlok this isn't a souls game explicitely they seperated from the souls name partly so they didn't have to do that exact thing over and over
[6:14:24] <Darkrenai> D E L E T CHARACTER
[6:14:26] <$LucasifTheOdd> order doesn't explain what order actually means though
[6:14:26] <genmypoweralready> GAME OVER YEEEAAAAAAH
[6:14:26] <CapCasual> @PatStaresAt How many hours?
[6:14:27] <%kewlmyc> 10/10
[6:14:27] <%Kemmybelle> You… did it
[6:14:27] <%captain_thickthighs> moonlight
[6:14:28] <NewWillinium> So Pat. . .Final Thoughts on the Game? Good and Bad?
[6:14:30] <+InhumanMilitia> on to ng+ and powerhouse every boss like a monster
[6:14:32] <ElSuperNova> Play again?
[6:14:33] <@DakotaMacDoodle> @PatStaresAt  You can Finally play the game now!
[6:14:33] <%Monkeyweed21> @CptHarlok In Elden Ring you can straight up fix the status quo instead of having to choose between perpetuation and an uncertain new future
[6:14:35] <%tetraes> tetraes subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Lyndell might be my favorite Anor Londo
[6:14:42] <VaguelyHeroic> Finger but hole?
[6:14:43] <Zourath> @anoldtoilet You misunderstood Ranni's motives and that ending. Her entire goal, her motive is "screw the divine, kick them all out, no godly interference of mortals". The "cold silence" is a metaphor for "gods won't answer mortal pleas anymore, since they're evicted".
[6:14:46] <+RedMaskBandit> PokBlaziken
[6:14:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> wait game good?
[6:14:48] <rudiciuscaesar> was this the hardest Souls game?
[6:14:52] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt When do you think Woolie will finally be done?
[6:14:54] <%dcentii> boy are the final 5 bosses difficult tho
[6:14:56] <+RedMaskBandit> kill all npcs
[6:14:56] <%anoldtoilet> @CptHarlok fias ending is pretty good. the golden order is over and then you get a normal fantasy world where people are born and die with no problems.
[6:15:08] <Chaos_Aether> GOTY Nomination ?
[6:15:10] <BlockingDisabled> Time to wait for DLC lol
[6:15:12] <ElSuperNova> @rudiciuscaesar This is probably one of the easiest
[6:15:13] <senfood> I think this is the best game of all time.
[6:15:13] <RubberFistFight> @CptHarlok Fia's is probably the best ending, tbh
[6:15:16] <+vaderxyz1970> How does this compare to Okami 1, 2 and 3?
[6:15:20] <rosabellamelantha> @anoldtoilet the idea that Ranni lies to you assumes she's some master manipulator that was ever anything but COMPLETELY HONEST from the start but ok
[6:15:21] <%Cozy90> game of the decade
[6:15:23] <MagisterBanana> It's gonna be really hard to top this game
[6:15:24] <+boomstarprime> pat plz no delete
[6:15:27] <+Mrbaconator> @dcentii i melted hora lou second try lmao woulda been first but i forgot to heal after summoning mimic
[6:15:28] <+Kyma1020> kudos to final boss actually being the main theme music
[6:15:31] <rudiciuscaesar> @ElSuperNova that's what I was feeling
[6:15:32] <Omenaire_> do you remember how long your first playthroughs of other souls games were?
[6:15:36] <boostergoldz> there's an okami 3?
[6:15:39] <NewWillinium> What would say is your biggest problem with the game?
[6:15:40] <mrtanaka111> magnus opus
[6:15:40] <RustyQuarters> One of the best games of the past decade
[6:15:41] <%anoldtoilet> @anoldtoilet i didnt misunderstand though.
[6:15:44] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> DLC?
[6:15:44] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Where would you rank it amongst the other Soulsborne games?
[6:15:45] <%dcentii> This is easy gonna win GOTY unless botw 2 comes out and goes crazy too
[6:15:45] <rosabellamelantha> People really don't understand metaphor apparently
[6:15:54] <Trace_Bovier> how did you like the final boss?
[6:15:55] <cayitoz> where does from go from here, I feel like this is their "final" game
[6:15:55] <%Valdorick> Note that even the SUN is a star Ranni wants to push away. She only wants the moon. And the Golden Order IS the sun. *Sunlight Spear is in the game, and its Radagon's Golden Spear attack*
[6:15:57] <%kewlmyc> God of War Ragnarock or BOTW2 would have to kick complete ass and come out this year for Elden Ring not to sweep GOTY lists.
[6:15:58] <%Agami23> that weird bug where black flame heals
[6:16:00] <RubberFistFight> @anoldtoilet yes I'm sure a liar would absolutely be honest to the people who would be most helpful to her if lied to. Kappa
[6:16:00] <+dilltacular> @PatStaresAt chances at DLC perhaps???
[6:16:03] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> what was your favorite boss to fight?
[6:16:04] <rudiciuscaesar> that dragon breath....
[6:16:07] <+KingKrampus> @patstaresat Congratulations on beating the game Pat! Proud of you!
[6:16:13] <%anoldtoilet> ranni is not even capable of her own agency shes being controlled by an alien moon god and living in a puppet of the moons emissary
[6:16:14] <djblue_shift> the rune economy and upgrade mats are wack
[6:16:14] <+GammaSan55> Sorcery playthrough when?
[6:16:15] <Sunstalker> The entirety of North Caelid is also just so bare for content?
[6:16:16] <doster504> double sword knight comes to mind
[6:16:17] <%furiousfurioso> those worm face fuckers, hate em
[6:16:18] <%Monkeyweed21> End of Elden Ring 1 is Radahn, end of Elden Ring 2 is Leyndell
[6:16:18] <+Grayhammatter> those multi-armed revenants are the worst
[6:16:18] <+boomstarprime> malenia is bullshit
[6:16:19] <%JoshManVGH> Three weeks of work in two weeks... jesus dude... thanks for the content, but go enjoy some time off!
[6:16:20] <%SaiyanShoto> Fuck the Gargoyles
[6:16:21] <Evendrag> The ulcerated tree spirit can go
[6:16:23] <%kewlmyc> Fuck the giant bear
[6:16:24] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> UN BEAR ABLE
[6:16:24] <%dekkitout> Not enough fights where it's just some shirtless dude doing wrastling moves
[6:16:25] <%cade_calrayn> For fuck's sake y'all quit arguing about the endings
[6:16:26] <%dcentii> Royal Revenant is def my least favorite enemy type
[6:16:28] <+Pookiedaexzile> How Dare you
[6:16:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> Runebear don't give afuck
[6:16:29] <+Mrbaconator> I dislike that heavy armor is basically useless for taking hits
[6:16:29] <+InhumanMilitia> roid bear not fun
[6:16:30] <ElSuperNova> Waiting for PC patches
[6:16:30] <Trace_Bovier> how did you like the final boss?
[6:16:32] <%tetraes> @PatStaresAt  do you think there was too much in the game and it would have benefited from being a bit smaller and more concise?
[6:16:33] <Sol_Install> LUL
[6:16:34] <%JoshManVGH> Rune Bear is fucked

[6:16:36] <mrtanaka111> @Valdorick golden orders isnt the sun, just aligned to its own light
[6:16:36] <%Agami23> bear or runebear?
[6:16:37] <$LucasifTheOdd> Bear is terrible, any enemy that takes your entire screen is garbage
[6:16:38] <%MartinOfLoxley> LUL I thought you would have said the Enemy flower
[6:16:39] <Zebroneath> they need to tone him down
[6:16:39] <%tidesplitter27> What was your favorite Easter egg from earlier games!
[6:16:41] <+Mowsferatu> woah
[6:16:42] <%Valdorick> And the golden order had a Sun Presence that wanted to make an eternal conflict without people dying just for shits and giggles. So yeah, the order is broken. Fuck it. Ranni all the way.
[6:16:42] <XxMoliciousxX> bear bear or ape-bear?
[6:16:43] <Shardlab> Regular bear or Runeclaw Bear?
[6:16:44] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Where would you rank this amongst the other Souls games?
[6:16:44] <Clyderso> Double Gargoyle thoughts?
[6:16:45] <%dcentii> Revenant is way worse than runebear yall crazy
[6:16:45] <+Jeshk0> byebye pat
[6:16:46] <medril07> big or small bear?
[6:16:47] <fatalDestiny> The bear feels like it's meant to teach the player something, but I have no idea what,
[6:16:48] <+Pookiedaexzile> That Bear Did so much for you
[6:16:50] <%Dew217> @PatStaresAt Congrats My dude I had a blast watch. Cant wait to pick it up myself and actually play a fromsoft game
[6:16:53] <$sassyquatch963> i only remember seeing the bear in like, 2 forests, and aren't an issue once you get under them
[6:16:57] <saraizarai> do you want a dlc?
[6:16:59] <oda_flobunaga> Fuck Manipedes
[6:17:04] <genmypoweralready> The game is exactly as big as it needed to be
[6:17:04] <medril07> noice
[6:17:06] <kazadog> there should have been a fist weapon with a powerbomb weapon art
[6:17:07] <+Mowsferatu> 120 hours wow
[6:17:09] <leole11> i never had a problem with bears, just smack them around lol
[6:17:11] <%robotoken> Would you recommend this game to someone who has never played a souls game?
[6:17:14] <Gorgs7> This man is wrong
[6:17:16] <+boomstarprime> yeah runebear sucks
[6:17:19] <+RedMaskBandit> too strong like real bear.
[6:17:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> somehow they made a 100+ hour RPG with literally no filler
[6:17:23] <CptHarlok> I'm going to say I fucking love how big this game is.  Smaller can fuck off.
[6:17:24] <mrtanaka111> do a parry build
[6:17:26] <%dekkitout> Magic Weeb run confirmed

[6:17:34] <%anoldtoilet> literally more than you did lol
[6:17:37] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> you can skip Stormveil entirely by going around it
[6:17:38] <@Lion_kun> What are you even gonna do now, Pat?
[6:17:39] <XxMoliciousxX> speedrun?
[6:17:41] <@Lion_kun> Take a break?
[6:17:42] <@DakotaMacDoodle> so little
[6:17:43] <%Monkeyweed21> Wing of Astel FUCKS btw @PatStaresAt
[6:17:43] <$LucasifTheOdd> I think you can skip almost all the bosses
[6:17:44] <NaberiustheNefarious> speedruns are already under 40 minutes
[6:17:44] <%dcentii> @PatStaresAt gonna do the Mohg skip get 640k Runes in as soon as you get to Liurnia?
[6:17:44] <%Felhad> @patstaresat try Wing of Astel when you get that too
[6:17:45] <%kewlmyc> Moonveil is fucking busted, and I love it. But Sword of Night and Flame is more busted
[6:17:46] <%dekkitout> Until/if moonveil is touched
[6:17:46] <+RedMaskBandit> at MIN 120 hours for the majority of the game
[6:17:46] <@QueequegTheater> @Mrbaconator That includes skips though
[6:17:47] <IvanMistwalker> Become Vergil!
[6:17:47] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt Literally the only bosses you need to fight are the ones in and after Faram
[6:17:48] <genmypoweralready> Elden Ring is the Epic Fantasy to DS's dark fantasy and it shows in scale
[6:17:48] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> vergil run confirmed
[6:17:50] <senfood> INT builds are can be busted as fuck early game.
[6:17:51] <%anoldtoilet> your own weapon arts are as/more busted than moonveil
[6:17:51] <BigBruthaThunda> that dragonball move jus melts everything in the game
[6:17:52] <$LucasifTheOdd> You can go straight to the capital if you want
[6:17:56] <zhenthrim213> thts wht im doin for my 2nd

[6:18:03] <+boomstarprime> hoarfrost + bleed is crazy broken
[6:18:06] <%Agami23> my brother went like 33 hours without leveling up because weapon upgrades can carry you. the draconic tree sentinel and gargoyles stopped that
[6:18:06] <Trace_Bovier> how did you like the final boss?
[6:18:06] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> A rush on Ng+ and i beat it in like 1 and a half hour
[6:18:07] <+RedMaskBandit> it's really fun
[6:18:07] <%Valdorick> DELETE PATRON
[6:18:09] <purple9z> you only really need to play for about 40 mins or so

[6:18:41] <fatalDestiny> I was watching someone route a character setup route, and it seems like even without using glitches you can likely do the entire game in 2 or 3 hours no sweat,
[6:18:42] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> PC runs fine for me
[6:18:43] <+Rofiarf> low battery

[6:19:19] <%NBUsagi> wait how do you play the PS4 version on the PS5?
[6:19:21] <@Lion_kun> So what are you gonna stream now
[6:19:22] <rudiciuscaesar> @PatStaresAt thanks for clarifying.
[6:19:26] <%Agami23> on ps4 i found a single instance of the game slowign down to 2 fps for like 30 seconds
[6:19:26] <Parapattern> I'm stuck playing PS4 on PS4
[6:19:29] <medril07> hmm
[6:19:29] <+Rofiarf> touch grass....
[6:19:29] <+RedMaskBandit> ps4 is fine even with long load screans
[6:19:29] <+heiro001> grass ain't worth no 60 frames
[6:19:32] <sothatsprettybrutal> it seems insane they just wouldn't put an "actually 60" mode into the ps5 one it can clearly do it
[6:19:32] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> I started ps4 today It's just better
[6:19:34] <%dcentii> the speedruns of this game go crazy
