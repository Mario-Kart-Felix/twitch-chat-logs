[0:06:40] <%bundle_of_herbs> mushy brainz
[0:06:41] <secret_npc> too much finger
[0:06:42] <+bagelstrider> Has From always had bad optimization?
[0:06:42] <jmepik> it not great
[0:06:45] <%mighty_max_t> Mornin' Pat. Gotta head to bed since I work overnights, but I'll definitely check the VOD when I'm at work!
[0:06:49] <%furiousfurioso> SURE DOES
[0:06:50] <+DrFacilier> Had a few stutters but overall not that noticeable
[0:06:50] <%LorcaNomad> man it looks so bad on PC
[0:06:50] <%gitgouda> oh really?
[0:06:58] <MaritimeSpanker> @bagelstrider almost always
[0:06:58] <RemnanTaka> the play stay 5?
[0:06:58] <%gitgouda> that suuuucks
[0:06:59] <%tusk102> im on a ps4 hahaha
[0:06:59] <jmepik> @bagelstrider sort of but Sekiro seemed smoother
[0:07:02] <%josnotforlewd> @bagelstrider Ye it gets fixed like in a month
[0:07:03] <ExpressNode> Oh I said fuck the PC version. Have a 3070 and I still won't own that.  Also didn't get the PS5 version.
[0:07:03] <%Wyrmspirit> literally playing it right now, frame drops every now and then but it's not THAT bad imo...
[0:07:04] <jmepik> tbf this is way beefier
[0:07:07] <%Fefe41> Ok what about the guys who play on the PS4
[0:07:09] <Treasure_Vault> Go to menu
[0:07:09] <MaritimeSpanker> only DS2 has really ever ran perfectly
[0:07:10] <Parapattern> God I wish I had a PS5 or a good PC
[0:07:11] <TyphoonSwirl> PS4 supremecy

[0:07:26] <%SaiyanShoto> SaiyanShoto subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! Happy to see you enjoying Elden Ring, I’m looking forward to getting my copy later today
[0:07:27] <%mighty_max_t> Didn't another game have PS5 Rest mode issues as well?
[0:07:34] <zanzibarian_hamster> I've heard some guy managed to get DS2 running on a thinkpad, wild
[0:07:34] <%LorcaNomad> yeah they have a history of bad PC releases
[0:07:36] <+bagelstrider> I know original Das was horrible on PC
[0:07:37] <Treasure_Vault> Thanks Activision?
[0:07:39] <%josnotforlewd> I also heard that the solutions are really weird but easy, apparently the Epic Launcher can cause stuttering
[0:07:44] <%Dakuu75> month? really? (damn)
[0:07:45] <TortillaFGC> It’s got that fromsoft fps jank for sure
[0:07:49] <jmepik> yeah that's fine I'll be playing this for a WHILE
[0:07:51] <@Ranryu692> @wyrmspirit supposedly it gets worse the deeper into the game you get
[0:07:53] <%LorcaNomad> DS2 was fucking BUSTED on PC release
[0:07:54] <%SaiyanShoto> I feel like the PC version being funky is kinda normal for FromSoft
[0:07:54] <@GeneralSCPatton> So far it's run alright on my PC and my bf's.
[0:08:01] <ExpressNode> Its a huge game
[0:08:01] <+DrFacilier> Bloodborne had some bad bugs and they fixed it within two weeks didnt they?
[0:08:01] <haisho> sounds about right
[0:08:10] <%Mr_Pylon> I had to unplug all my other USB devices last night in order to get it to recognize my gamepad.
[0:08:12] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt ER sub had some fixes that worked for a bunch of people on pc and they helped me
[0:08:16] <AvroEltz> videogames are hard
[0:08:16] <+gochira> I've got that big ryzen cpu and an ANCIENT 1080 and my performance has been pretty good so far with minor stutters every now and then
[0:08:18] <%bundle_of_herbs> a player might do it again before then
[0:08:22] <+bagelstrider> I get stable 60 fps on medium most of the time
[0:08:24] <kingmemelord97> welp guess im not playing till April
[0:08:25] <+MamoruTheRed> sounds kinda like the bloodborne memory leak
[0:08:29] <%thugnasty117> Just got it last night downloaded it and Gunnar hit it hard tonight after work
[0:08:30] <%LorcaNomad> how many frames were you getting with OBS on, pat?
[0:08:31] <%ThomasOfTroy> This is why I wait to buy new games. Bugs, price, and DLC all make me wait
[0:08:34] <LunarRemix> That's on max settings or minimum?
[0:08:34] <MaritimeSpanker> yeah, I've heard much about that
[0:08:39] <%lunanilla> So it´s better to wait before I buy it? vreybiUff
[0:08:42] <%barrakuta371> even my 3090 struggles at times
[0:08:42] <MaritimeSpanker> using the old "-DX11" seems to work
[0:08:48] <MaritimeSpanker> somewhat, atleast

[0:08:50] <+mup420> Was fine this morning, updating my drivers and now it's waaaay worse.

[0:09:07] <%Iwantscandy> what's the CPU Pat's using?
[0:09:12] <Saltmeisterr> hi pat
[0:09:12] <%LorcaNomad> wow
[0:09:12] <%grumpiestchris> grumpiestchris subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[0:09:15] <ExpressNode> Damn it must be CPU intensive
[0:09:19] <@Fuggins4U> maybe your house is haunted??
[0:09:32] <%tusk102> just broken
[0:09:35] <kikoeru_san> same
[0:09:43] <MaritimeSpanker> huh
[0:09:44] <%Dakuu75> it's jsut the game
[0:09:48] <+bagelstrider> same my gpu has almost no load and it dies lmao
[0:09:52] <ExpressNode> Wow. Must have not been optimized well
[0:09:52] <afronooch> The only Elden Ring i care about is Amelieance Leveilleur
[0:09:58] <@Fuggins4U> i hope they fix all this, because i want to get this on PC someday
[0:09:58] <+MamoruTheRed> Yknow, there was a time understand this kind of issue at launch for them, but cmon it's been 10+ years fromsoftware.
[0:09:59] <%Wyrmspirit> its almost certainly a shader cashing issue with D12 I think
[0:10:03] <kikoeru_san> they need to decrease the amount of foliage tbh
[0:10:03] <+Graves102> @PatStaresAt Is this why it uses 16 RAM
[0:10:08] <kikoeru_san> that might help
[0:10:12] <@Fuggins4U> hooray!
[0:10:18] <MaritimeSpanker> Watch the Orb, The Baby and the Big Baby
[0:10:20] <+alphonseisbest> @afronooch YEYEYEYE, GET THAT ELLF MILF USSY
[0:10:20] <%Ironbuttz> are there any reports oif folks running it with less than recommended hardware?  this is to anyone in chat
[0:10:21] <%Mr_Pylon> Aside from my controller issue, I've had a fairly smooth time on my PC but I seem to be an outlier
[0:10:21] <+bagelstrider> you do big sword playthrough
[0:10:22] <@Fuggins4U> thank you Rich Evans Jr
[0:10:23] <%bundle_of_herbs> of course pat's house is haunted, skellmo is right there!
[0:10:24] <ExpressNode> I heard he has 32gb of RAM
[0:10:24] <%shanna_become_gamer> LUL LUL
[0:10:25] <%CavemanInCave> csbeastSetIn
[0:10:26] <%Dakuu75> honestly. some-stuttering, aside. I been enjoying it on PC
[0:10:26] <+PesterChunklage> it must be that voodoo magic that somehow got nier replicant running with its broken code
[0:10:41] <+alphonseisbest> ring ring gotta get the RING
[0:10:41] <%MooseIsGoose> I have only seen it stuttering on area transitions. but becames clear as mud when it happened
[0:10:45] <kingmemelord97> how are you liking the open world formula ?
[0:10:45] <%Wyrmspirit> at least on the bright side if it is a shader cache issue they can fix that pretty easily
[0:11:00] <ExpressNode> Something happened like that to me with the P4G release on PC with memory leakage.
[0:11:05] <TyphoonSwirl> i suddenly feel so influenced
[0:11:06] <%bundle_of_herbs> saucy
[0:11:09] <%RayReborne> walked through the snow and Deep cold for this game this morning lol
[0:11:16] <%linSP> psaOrb
[0:11:16] <+MamoruTheRed> ps4 surprisingly runs smooth
[0:11:17] <%Iwantscandy> @patstaresat do you know if people are having issues with systems using ddr5 ram?
[0:11:19] <+bagelstrider> the knight kills fps lmao
[0:11:23] <%tusk102> OOF
[0:11:30] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> dammit When Pat said Noon I was thinking Noon CST not EST
[0:11:30] <%linSP> I have invisible enemies
[0:11:35] <+PesterChunklage> the enemies hit hard enough that the game pauses to give you time to rethink your life
[0:11:40] <%YakumoYomi> I got that too the first time. When I started a new game again, I didn't get the stutter on that first boss.
[0:11:40] <%MooseIsGoose> I am lucky I have a ps5
[0:11:50] <MaritimeSpanker> what
[0:11:53] <+pugszerosugar> Oh yeah it’s Greg

[0:12:09] <+scarman125> how does it run on ps4?
[0:12:10] <%tusk102> feet=balls
[0:12:11] <%barrakuta371> no dont do this to me
[0:12:20] <+bagelstrider> @alphonseisbest one guy said its smooth
[0:12:24] <%tusk102> @scarman125 good! can confirm as a ps4 player
[0:12:28] <ExpressNode> I had a PS5 for a couple months and have to say if game performances are less than a PS4 gonna have to bust out the PS4 Pro rotting in my storage.
[0:12:36] <%josnotforlewd> @alphonseisbest I've heard it runs fine but can't confirm cause my ps4 is molten lava

[0:12:43] <+scarman125> @scarman125 thank god
[0:12:48] <MaritimeSpanker> FromSoft games tends to run better on the consoles, right?
[0:12:52] <%Wyrmspirit> the worst stutter I've had so far has been the tree sentinel when he reflects my magic back at me, chugs really bad when he does that
[0:12:52] <+Mrbaconator> i haven't had issues outside of 2 crashes however I can say the game DOES NOT like it if you have a PS4 controller plugged in and it disconnects it freaks out for a few seconds
[0:13:07] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt ps5 and ps4 has crossplay so you have double chances for pvp
[0:13:15] <+Katashi25> Morning Pat!

[0:13:43] <+MamoruTheRed> @expressnode yeah, thats a pretty on point take for it. it's pretty ridiculous how the ps4 version (as far as I've seen) has 0 of these issues and I've played since 11 cst...oh God I've been playing for 12 hours
[0:13:44] <afronooch> its nice hearing pat while work idk what it is

[0:17:27] <+xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt Did you hear that this game has a "Easy mode is now selectable"?
[0:17:30] <deviljhojho_> the game seems really good but the way the world is designed makes it way deadlier than other fromsoft games
[0:17:36] <%barrakuta371> wow that shield would have been great against the tree spirit
[0:17:41] <VenDober> That's gonna be busted in pvp
[0:17:45] <LunarRemix> @xcompleasedad Wait what

[0:26:18] <WippaDippa> got a bit greedy
[0:26:21] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @jmepik no i think he got it some place on the map
[0:26:23] <$Smokay17> Luring him into the field was better than fighting near the rocks.
[0:26:29] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt have you found the skill vendor yet?

[0:27:26] <%Dakuu75> Did Pat find the hub world yet? (because I couldn't)
[0:27:31] <+mup420> Demi-Humans doing work.
[0:27:35] <%tusk102> kinda does
[0:27:37] <%cade_calrayn> That makes sense
[0:27:38] <@Ranryu692> so you're saying there should be a pause

[0:29:29] <CaptainBright> @PatStaresAt Have you tried using Torrent to horse joust with this dude?
[0:29:43] <+Jeshk0> is it just me or does the music sound like its coming from an old VHS?
[0:29:47] <Miirrk0> Oleg :(
[0:29:47] <%PrimalDweeb> Agreed
[0:29:50] <%D00msDayDan> D00msDayDan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Man, I love having gainful employment and being able to pay my sub myself, help me pray for this transfer out of customer service next week to be approved 🙏

[0:29:53] <secret_npc> glad it's not just me
[0:29:53] <Saltmeisterr> BRO
[0:29:53] <%barrakuta371> @CaptainBright HE did but was still having trouble
[0:29:55] <BlueBiscuitGT> That shield does massive damage
[0:29:55] <+xcompleasedad> @CaptainBright He did. He sucks with Torrent
[0:29:58] <Saltmeisterr> That shield
[0:29:58] <+Cuon_Alpinus> bonk
[0:30:00] <ExpressNode> I guess being more open world means enemies are less dense
[0:30:00] <Aussie_Manny> Can that shield be broken?
[0:30:03] <razieltano123> @CaptainBright He did. it did not work.
[0:30:05] <secret_npc> Do your fights on stream
[0:30:05] <xxHungryxx> Tree Sentinel is a badass
[0:30:08] <LunarRemix> Enemies give a lot less souls in general because you're sort of expected to dick around
[0:30:10] <+Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt i been using storm gate to grind
[0:30:15] <CaptainBright> @xcompleasedad I see
[0:30:20] <Aussie_Manny> Damn it.

[0:32:18] <MaritimeSpanker> that blacksmith is a callback to Ed and Boldwin
[0:32:19] <%bundle_of_herbs> having assumptions in a fromsoft game?
[0:32:25] <%Brassnarwhal> are you okay pat? you went all day yesterday and the title looks pretty delirious

[0:34:20] <secret_npc> I read the dumb pat thing and got the joke immediately
[0:34:20] <LunarRemix> You have to talk to Blacksmith and this lady back and forth a couple of times

[0:34:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> I hear they grow hair out of their skin 🤢

[0:34:57] <+dreadd_wolfsbane> Pat, you have Crazy Talk. Everyday is gaslight Pat day.

[0:35:03] <%unstablebeast19> unstablebeast19 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! damn, 13 moths of subbing to this fun baby man. and I have a question pat, if you could choose between atlas making a persona 4 golden remake, or Ryu ga making an actual kiwami 3, which would you choose?
[0:35:09] <%josnotforlewd> Wait I looked away for two seconds are we trying to hook him up with red cape?
[0:35:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> She wants to lick your head crust
[0:35:10] <%discoinfierno> She'd never want to be with a guy like me.... unless.....
[0:35:13] <sweatch0> Is that the same voice actor as the skelly smith from ds1?
[0:35:13] <+Mistah_AD> So have you been keeping a journal for events so far that ya might need to go back to?
[0:35:22] <Aussie_Manny> Is this game PS4-PS5 upgradable?

[0:35:49] <42nfl19> hey she aint wearing red anyemore
[0:35:49] <%IvanMistwalker> adorable
[0:35:50] <%PrimalDweeb> You should just put PS5 in the title of your stream... Who am I kidding, people would still ask.

[0:36:13] <@GeneralSCPatton> The spirit summons feel completely inspired by Cinders and I love it
[0:36:17] <Maids4lyfe> is that how people got multi arms?
[0:36:20] <+alphonseisbest> @Brassnarwhal being ugly make u funny, women like to laugh, it fits
[0:36:21] <%Brassnarwhal> @marvel877 no i was just making sure he was okay but i didnt see the stream title yesterday cause i was listening to him while i was at work for the early stream
[0:36:21] <tanarath> @brassnarwhal I think that's something else, mainly looking for people who are actually people.
[0:36:22] <enddword> why cant she hold us
[0:36:24] <Vikken141> Oleg can be even more powerful
[0:36:28] <%HotMafia81> Spirit Tuna Prentice

[0:36:44] <%Brassnarwhal> @alphonseisbest so that's my problem I'm boring AND ugly
[0:36:44] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the map marking system is super useful for marking npcs
[0:36:45] <marcomatame> whoever started to add -ussy to things is an enemy of humanity
[0:36:45] <Gorgs7> lol, 1 rune short of upgrade 1
[0:36:46] <%Jhylla81> Power up your stand
[0:36:48] <sweatch0> giving oleg a big juice

[0:37:13] <cochramd1992> @marcomatame agreed
[0:37:19] <%gitgouda> oh i wish i thought of that
[0:37:20] <%Brassnarwhal> if you level him up enough does he evolve into a double one called Olegs?
[0:37:29] <%bundle_of_herbs> can you beat the asshole mad guy in the hub now?
[0:37:32] <razieltano123> @PatStaresAt For the letter quest. We still don't know if her death was preventable or not.
[0:37:35] <cosmicdischarge> is it true the elden ring doesn't run that well?
[0:37:37] <%lunanilla> Bara Tiddy Oleg vreybiHeart
[0:37:39] <%ono_jm> need to upgrade Oleg
[0:37:41] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Since hollowing isn't a thing anymore, isn't great that you don't have to look like dried jerky all the time now?
[0:37:44] <Gorgs7> he was super obvious if I remember though
[0:37:46] <%Brassnarwhal> @alphonseisbest and my personality is almost is bad too
[0:37:48] <TheBlankAce> Did you ever go back to the cave Patches was after he said he'd move?
[0:38:00] <AndreDingus> ??
[0:38:21] <Aussie_Manny> Souls NPCs can die and never come back. It sucks. monkaS
[0:38:25] <mrtanaka111> is pat?
[0:38:25] <luciluxlu0> did pat find those wise animals yet?
[0:38:31] <%Brassnarwhal> @cosmicdischarge on pc many users are having stuttering and framerate issues, turning off anti aliasing can help
[0:38:34] <Aussie_Manny> Except for the Doll. She's unstoppable.
[0:38:36] <%SaiyanShoto> All that screaming was probably coming from people who didn’t even play the game yet
[0:38:51] <%linSP> Did anyone get the quest from the wolf guy in the foggy ruins? He aggrod on me for some reason and I got nothing
[0:38:56] <%Brassnarwhal> @saiyanshoto we call them psa1guy
[0:39:07] <Aussie_Manny> Man, I really wish that shield was breakable. IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS!
[0:39:08] <xxHungryxx> That summon is doing work
[0:39:11] <+MamoruTheRed> Out of the 13 bosses I've beaten thus far, this dude I have yet to fell. thats not a humble brag, thats a statement of pure frustration
[0:39:12] <+polothegreatest> chat always spoils plagueCringe
[0:39:13] <mrtanaka111> wude
[0:39:14] <AndreDingus> AAHH
[0:39:14] <jddaed> F
[0:39:15] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I think people were just joshin you on that one
[0:39:18] <+Freakin_Wolfy> @PatStaresAt can you move your webcam to the other side so we can see your items?
[0:39:25] <+tempestzephyr> that shield bash is strong
[0:39:25] <luciluxlu0> if you want to know I know
[0:39:40] <BlueBiscuitGT> the lesson is that the shield side seems more dangerous
[0:39:48] <%Brassnarwhal> souls is more important
[0:39:50] <%WackyGear> got again by the shield attack
[0:39:55] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat rocking the turtle shell!!
[0:39:55] <adithehella> have you killed the spider that roderika talked about?
[0:40:00] <%Brassnarwhal> we need to see those juicy runes more
[0:40:03] <+xerj> They probably want to see your estus *shrug*
[0:40:05] <%IamGrapes> good morning Pat n Chat!
[0:40:15] <jubejube56> Yknow that shield attack almost looks like horse man’s own alpha counter
[0:40:27] <mrtanaka111> has pat seen the (spoilers)?
[0:40:33] <+bravo059> Wait, this game has stands? Ive been playing for 9 hours and haven't found stands...
[0:40:35] <%HotMafia81> I'd rather see rune count so i can be appropriately shattered with every death
[0:40:36] <Aussie_Manny> Get 'em, Oleg!
[0:40:36] <+tempestzephyr> it blocks the heals, so you're going to get people yelling at you to heal even when you don't have any
[0:40:54] <T_Sasquatch> That shield ground slam is bullshit
[0:40:55] <Anidem1714> Is that a turtle shell shield
[0:41:02] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Isn't it great that you don't have to look like beef jerky all the time anymore? I think that is one of the biggest changes lol.
[0:41:02] <MaritimeSpanker> Is Zangief a wise animal?
[0:41:03] <DudeDern> !Uptime
[0:41:03] <+Dommykins> I watched a streamer die to this guy 300 times last night lol.
[0:41:04] <@Moobot> @DudeDern I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 41m 11s.
[0:41:08] <%LorcaNomad> you got this pat
[0:41:09] <LunarRemix> oof
[0:41:09] <NoodleFrosty> Shiiiiiiiit that was so close!
[0:41:10] <%SaiyanShoto> Fuck it put your face cam in the middle of the screen
[0:41:10] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Oh come on!
[0:41:11] <adithehella> wow so close
[0:41:13] <BlueBiscuitGT> Oleg almost finished him
[0:41:15] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the sorcery vendor lady (with the stone head mask) is behind where you fought pumpkin head (waypoint ruins) if you want to mark her on the map
[0:41:17] <VirtuaRailith> zangief is a fat animal
[0:41:18] <+Comb711> Is Zangief a good boy?
[0:41:18] <MaritimeSpanker> He is a cutie though
[0:41:20] <Aussie_Manny> No?!
[0:41:20] <xxHungryxx> Tree Sentinel, Watchdog, & Bloodhound Knight might have been my favorite bosses in the network test
[0:41:21] <%cade_calrayn> he does his best
[0:41:22] <%Mister_McDerp> Oleg almost had it!
[0:41:24] <%Treuan> Edlin rang
[0:41:25] <%Wallabri> psaGiefstare psaGiefstare psaGiefstare
[0:41:25] <%bundle_of_herbs> anti wise
[0:41:25] <@GeneralSCPatton> Neat tip: Crouch-attacking is a faster cheaper way to do dodge-attacks
[0:41:26] <AndreDingus> he's bri'ish
[0:41:27] <WippaDippa> you get so close!
[0:41:30] <%Brassnarwhal> Mana chug before health chug what a Chad I'm too cowardly for those moves
[0:41:33] <%TG_Cid11> the wise animals were a pain in the ass to find so good luck
[0:41:35] <+Jeshk0> the cutest
[0:41:39] <%IamGrapes> FATHER I IZ WAIZ psaDogchamp
[0:41:40] <Aussie_Manny> Zangief is a charming animal.

[0:50:30] <%Dakuu75> that merchant right next to a bonfire? I think he's the furthest down grace you have atm, on your map
[0:50:32] <%TG_Cid11> he is near the grace closest to the tower
[0:50:32] <luciluxlu0> merchant by a grace
[0:50:36] <+Klondikebar2> @PatStaresAt Didnt you want to upgrade your summons?

[0:51:21] <mrtanaka111> try finger but whole
[0:51:25] <%Dakuu75> holy shit chat
[0:51:26] <MaritimeSpanker> One guy
[0:51:28] <devanmuse> a clue to what?
[0:51:30] <%ForlornCarton> There are "special" paintings in the game, that does not appear to be one of them
[0:51:30] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Is that Anor Londo?
[0:51:31] <LunarRemix> Some paitings point to treasures
[0:51:35] <sweatch0> that the pasta tower
[0:51:35] <Gregorhasjoined> Try tongue but hole
[0:51:36] <%HotMafia81> I'm watching.  I'm doing that thing where I'm not actually working.
[0:51:39] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> the painting is of the tower outside
[0:51:39] <%linSP> Pat you’ve been talking in my ear while I work for the last 9 hours you’ve streamed
[0:51:39] <WippaDippa> jump into the paintin
[0:51:40] <sweatch0> leaning one
[0:51:41] <+xerj> people trying to spoil everything
[0:51:43] <%Wallabri> nighto35Hmm nighto35Hmm nighto35Hmm
[0:51:49] <mrtanaka111> amazing paiting ahead
[0:51:57] <%Brassnarwhal> i read somewhere in game that the paintings show in game locations that have stuff
[0:52:02] <%Criotos> there's a painting elsewhere you can examine that has treasure where it is painted
[0:52:04] <%morningmoondude> triple jump into the painting
[0:52:05] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt Yeah some of the paintings are hidden treasure. Though the one I found you could pick up for reference
[0:52:06] <%bundle_of_herbs> take a screenshot so you don't have to come back
[0:52:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> You can see the tower they painted through the window
[0:52:09] <AvroEltz> is that tower anor londo?
[0:52:20] <mrtanaka111> gaslight fridays
[0:52:24] <%Ironbuttz> man just ignore us Pat.  this is ridiculous
[0:52:24] <+xerj> disregard chat, acquire runes
[0:52:25] <critiquequartz> I feel like we’re gonna get some GameCube era myths of what’s in the game and how to unlock it
[0:52:27] <%Criotos> not all paintings do that though
[0:52:32] <@GeneralSCPatton> Not everything is the Painted World
[0:52:35] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Where are all these weird tips coming from lol
[0:52:40] <razieltano123> Pat doesn't need a goose chase.
[0:52:45] <%Brassnarwhal> @critiquequartz but some of them will be true
[0:52:47] <+Saggitori> l + ratio + no maidens + touch grace
[0:52:48] <marvel877> Greg wouldn't get gaslit...
[0:52:48] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt protip for spells/miracles: if they have a delay after the cast animation, npcs dont know how to deal with it because they roll at the cast and not at the spell shooting off
[0:52:49] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I didn't catch the first stream. What curse is afflicting this world?
[0:52:49] <Chaos_Aether> Can We enforce a No elp run
[0:52:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> There's a grey room where you can see bowser through a window
[0:52:58] <Astrophizz> you can play as Luigi if you solve the puzzle
[0:53:02] <%Brassnarwhal> @critiquequartz think about how you get to the dlc in dark souls 1
[0:53:05] <WippaDippa> seek maidens
[0:53:05] <TyphoonSwirl> what happens when everyone is one guy
[0:53:06] <critiquequartz> Yeah and that’s concerning
[0:53:11] <mrtanaka111> @Chaos_Aether can you stop the tides?
[0:53:18] <%bundle_of_herbs> but possible items tho

[0:55:03] <mrtanaka111> all that murder for nothing
[0:55:04] <MaritimeSpanker> I remember a friend telling me that this game would be a worse open world game than Breath of the Wild
[0:55:11] <Saltmeisterr> why not use ur shiny new halberd pat?
[0:55:12] <%Brassnarwhal> @42nfl19 that they fell with the ruins
[0:55:15] <+adamisbarely3d> when did pat get a turtle shell?
[0:55:16] <MaritimeSpanker> and I can only laugh in hindsight
[0:55:17] <critiquequartz> Can’t wait for the speed run of this to be 35 minutes and for them to kill the final boss with a twig
[0:55:18] <Anidem1714> How close to the end are you?
[0:55:18] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> IMPRESSIVE CREATURE

[0:55:58] <%scarman125> oh hey it's the beta armor
[0:55:58] <%PrimalDweeb> Yeah, he seems legit.
[0:55:58] <Ner234> That shield counter will get you killed
[0:56:01] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> He's still in the first area lol
[0:56:02] <WippaDippa> i spammed magic at this guy and get sooooo close just spamming lol
[0:56:02] <razieltano123> Warhammer looking ass.
[0:56:04] <+silvery_cricket> git gud
[0:56:04] <+dearghostss> wonder what this dude did to land in evergaol
[0:56:05] <%Brassnarwhal> crucible knoght is still real
[0:56:07] <zanzibarian_hamster> Fume knight 2.0
[0:56:08] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt haven't even fought margit yet and these mfers are asking if you beat the game
[0:56:09] <SolidusA> one shot
[0:56:10] <LunarRemix> You'd probably do good to come back with the Faith Halbert
[0:56:14] <Anidem1714> Wow!
[0:56:15] <+adamisbarely3d> hey look it's what would be a final boss in another game
[0:56:18] <luciluxlu0> you can. just parry. no really that's how I did it.
[0:56:18] <%zentheman01> BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD
[0:56:19] <ebrion> For Khorne
[0:56:21] <Anidem1714> !uptime
[0:56:21] <@Moobot> @Anidem1714 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 56m 29s.
[0:56:27] <%tusk102> oh nice

[0:56:35] <mrtanaka111> one boss
[0:56:35] <kingmemelord97> you can do it i believe in you chat
[0:56:36] <MaritimeSpanker> Margit was the Network test boss, right?
[0:56:38] <%Dakuu75> what's the different between the "standard" and "Keen" augment for ashes of war?
[0:56:38] <%tusk102> good job
[0:56:39] <+heiro001> good shield on him though
[0:56:41] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> It was when he was on the front page
[0:56:43] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> HE GOT THE HIGH GROUND
[0:56:45] <%zentheman01> dude he's putting your skull on the skull throne
[0:56:45] <cochramd1992> I must have stepped out before that
[0:56:49] <%Brassnarwhal> @maritimespanker yes
[0:56:51] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> its over
[0:56:56] <@GeneralSCPatton> I wonder if the stuff-fallen-from-sky has anything to do with the Underdark. Cyclical world collapse & burying?
[0:56:56] <kingmemelord97> i mean pat
[0:56:59] <mrtanaka111> so you cheated?
[0:57:00] <MaritimeSpanker> Because you used your big brass brain
[0:57:02] <+cowkid222> what item?
[0:57:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> plus you're just a god gamer
[0:57:06] <@StridentSong> Jerma was on Markit for like 3 hours
[0:57:10] <%luftraumm1> so you cheesed it
[0:57:18] <%cade_calrayn> Where did you get that bleed weapon, Pat?
[0:57:20] <WippaDippa> what does determination do?
[0:57:20] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat works well with many eyes on him. it's why he is King Stares At
[0:57:21] <42nfl19> Is Pat no longer friends with Bleed Knife?
[0:57:27] <$drabberfaun535> oh cook he found the darknut
[0:57:29] <%MooseIsGoose> have you gone and used the stone daggers on goblin statutes at the very first part of the game. it leads to a fun area.
[0:57:30] <%Brassnarwhal> @dakuu75 scaling, standard is default keen is increased dex scaling
[0:57:31] <%LorcaNomad> oh this guy again
[0:57:34] <+heiro001> he's just gonna punish you
[0:57:35] <xxHungryxx> no sips for u
[0:57:38] <BlueBiscuitGT> COMBO never STOPS!
[0:57:41] <luciluxlu0> it felt like it
[0:57:45] <+heiro001> damn
[0:57:47] <adithehella> oh man
[0:57:49] <@Fuggins4U> this dude is cool and brutal
[0:57:50] <+heiro001> come back later, no shame
[0:57:50] <adithehella> he wombo comboed you
[0:57:52] <+Saggitori> cool dude tho
[0:57:53] <+Dommykins> The Rushdown Knight
[0:57:54] <MaritimeSpanker> let him simmer for a while
[0:57:54] <WippaDippa> this guy is really aggressive
[0:57:55] <Sigma_190_Beta> @MooseIsGoose He did, and beat that boss.
[0:57:55] <Aussie_Manny> Why is he glowing like that?
[0:57:56] <BlueBiscuitGT> try the other one
[0:57:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think you need more numbers
[0:57:57] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> He seems really hard
[0:57:58] <mrtanaka111> just kill him lol
[0:57:58] <MaritimeSpanker> he's not goin' no where
[0:58:01] <%scarman125> CHICKEN
[0:58:07] <megaman_sentinel> is that the same guy Wollie was trying to fight
[0:58:08] <%MooseIsGoose> dang
[0:58:10] <%HotMafia81> He seems mean
[0:58:11] <%zentheman01> you have to go through the rest of Taris Nabad before you get the Crucible
[0:58:19] <WippaDippa> backstab him bro
[0:58:24] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Lol
[0:58:25] <SolidusA> mark him for later
[0:58:30] <+beavnation> castle time?
[0:58:30] <Aussie_Manny> khadKEK khadKEK khadKEK AWOOOOOO
[0:58:31] <%Brassnarwhal> @megaman_sentinel is that the kid with the ralts?
[0:58:32] <zanzibarian_hamster> bro just dont get hit
[0:58:34] <xxHungryxx> @megaman_sentinel No Woolie fought Bloodhound
[0:58:35] <ebrion> You need Nurgals Blessing first, lol
[0:58:36] <NoodleFrosty> Man when I first went against that horserider at the beginning of the game I was jokingly talking mad shit.
[0:58:37] <Vikken141> @megaman_sentinel nah, this guy is even more difficult
[0:58:38] <+Rare_Ruiz> Wanna get chat's opinion: Is Elden Ring slower than other Souls games, or is it just me?
[0:58:53] <NoodleFrosty> He clips me and it's immediate "OH FUCK HE'S LEGIT"
[0:58:57] <MaritimeSpanker> man, every time you fall down a height, I keep thinking "OH SHIT YOU DEAD", and then nothing
[0:58:59] <MaritimeSpanker> it's so weird
[0:59:08] <BlueBiscuitGT> I frames FTW
[0:59:13] <MayShip> invincibility frames lets go
[0:59:17] <luciluxlu0> @rare_ruiz felt fast to me
[0:59:17] <%Brassnarwhal> @rare_ruiz slower than bloodborn, much faster than ds1 or des
[0:59:30] <eustine> this looks great but a little like everything's underwater.
[0:59:31] <WippaDippa> that backstabbing reminds me of the dark souls 1 ps3 message
[0:59:51] <+SaintSalted> idk how the pvp community is gonna agree on a SL
[0:59:55] <MaritimeSpanker> Maybe it's more gear-reliant too?
[0:59:56] <%TG_Cid11> leveling does seem harder than normal
[1:00:01] <%tusk102> theres a shit ton of rune items you can slam into yoursel tho
[1:00:16] <%Brassnarwhal> @eustine idk if pat changed the video settings but by default theres a lot of visual effects on that soften the picture
[1:00:31] <+silvery_cricket> This feels like a game meant to be played over a 2 year pandemic where you cant go outside
[1:00:32] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat Can i main Bow and progress through the game
[1:00:34] <killjoy0025> Oh hes pretty
[1:00:39] <Omenaire_> !uptime
[1:00:39] <@Moobot> @Omenaire_ I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 47s.
[1:00:41] <Aussie_Manny> Beast Titan w/ Sword
[1:00:42] <%HotMafia81> It's Large Lad!
[1:00:46] <MaritimeSpanker> Godm bleed is stupid good
[1:00:51] <xxHungryxx> blood dagger is back
[1:00:54] <%TG_Cid11> Bleed is busted in this game
[1:00:54] <+OniOniOniiii> but can you RAINbow?
[1:00:54] <+Rare_Ruiz> I think I moght've fucked myself, cuz I killed the time waiting for this one by playing Nioh 2 in the meantime and the difference is crippling me.
[1:00:56] <eustine> @Brassnarwhal I meant gameplay wise.
[1:00:59] <NoodleFrosty> Man the fight for that dagger is super legit and had me panicking the first time he showed.  XD
[1:01:01] <WippaDippa> bow mains are for pros
[1:01:01] <+heiro001> gottem
[1:01:02] <luciluxlu0> bow feels real good in this tho
[1:01:03] <@GeneralSCPatton> Another tip: Equipping No Skill on your shield lets you swap to an empty right hand and safely kick open guards
[1:01:08] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I wanna be Hawkeye too
[1:01:11] <razieltano123> If it bleeds, we can kill it.
[1:01:12] <%daemonazaezal> I beat a lot of encounters and like 2 bosses with just bow
[1:01:14] <Aussie_Manny> That dagger is sick.
[1:01:19] <chowndawg> bows have a jumping shot
[1:01:20] <%daemonazaezal> Not that hard and its a lot better in elden ring
[1:01:24] <%daemonazaezal> BUY IT FROM A MERCHANT
[1:01:28] <%daemonazaezal> THERES A MERCHANT PAT
[1:01:30] <@GeneralSCPatton> It's an ash, I think you need to buy it
[1:01:31] <Minorou> gotta buy it
[1:01:31] <%raggedwharfrat> It's an ash of war
[1:01:32] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt skill vendor sells it
[1:01:33] <%TG_Cid11> you buy the no skill
[1:01:38] <%daemonazaezal> Open map
[1:01:39] <luciluxlu0> you have to find the merchant
[1:01:40] <+eanscrale> you have to buy THAT?
[1:01:43] <%LorcaNomad> pretty sure you buy it according to vaati
[1:01:44] <%zentheman01> Got any other fancy magic weapons other than the knife and halberd?
[1:01:46] <%raggedwharfrat> Yeah, absolutely
[1:01:46] <digaogrunge> Just buy it
[1:01:49] <%josnotforlewd> WHAT WOULD YOU BE BUYING????
[1:01:50] <%TG_Cid11> yes they are
[1:01:51] <WippaDippa> i dont need to buy that irl
[1:01:53] <luciluxlu0> yes.
[1:01:54] <%daemonazaezal> follow that path north east i think
[1:01:56] <+MamoruTheRed> Either blacksmith or a specific knife that allows you to do it yourself along with buying it
[1:01:57] <%TG_Cid11> maybe
[1:01:59] <%josnotforlewd> NOTHING???
[1:01:59] <%spitelite> you are right by them
[1:02:01] <%daemonazaezal> Its an old warrior dude
[1:02:03] <%HotMafia81> Yes hello, one of your finest nothing, please

[1:02:10] <luciluxlu0> it on the main path
[1:02:11] <%Brassnarwhal> @wippadippa i main NoSkill
[1:02:11] <+eanscrale> Maybe it's like a silencer
[1:02:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> You scrubs have to buy No Skill, I was born with it. We are not the same
[1:02:15] <%Mister_McDerp> so easy to miss stuff
[1:02:18] <%TG_Cid11> right of where you meet the blonde
[1:02:29] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @reallybigrocks LUL
[1:02:30] <42nfl19> I find it funny how you have to buy "nothing" lol

[1:09:06] <%SWFanatic> Pat AutoSave Fucboivin
[1:09:09] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> why is your penis in hell Pat
[1:09:15] <radiorosewater> why is your dick in hell pat?
[1:09:16] <WippaDippa> @maritimespanker I HATE IT SO MUCH
[1:09:18] <%HotMafia81> I love auto-save fuccboi games
[1:09:23] <xxHungryxx> Elden fuckboy
[1:09:31] <+xerj> Nah, you need to have a 100% lore complete run on your first blind playthrough
[1:09:32] <%SulfurousAcid> let's go Suck dicks in Hell 😎
[1:09:33] <%zentheman01> it's never nothing in these games
[1:09:36] <MaritimeSpanker> @WippaDippa I understand why, it's real annoying
[1:09:36] <%zentheman01> it'll probably kick your ass
[1:09:38] <42nfl19> The fact that the words "Secret wall"  exist fora messaging system means that they do exist in the game right?
[1:09:44] <radiorosewater> I've been described as an autosave fuckboy
[1:09:44] <MaritimeSpanker> people were doing that in the DS3 release too
[1:09:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> you didn't clear the Scrunko Fields in 2m46s and now the whole playthrough is botched
[1:09:46] <%Dakuu75> fun fact: Sprint/run is a toggle on torrent. You don't need to hold it
[1:09:49] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt theres a generic looking knight on a horse near the coast here, he drops a pretty good weapon skill
[1:10:03] <+Dommykins> its great content so far
[1:10:06] <%TG_Cid11> missed a big guy

[1:10:26] <+pugszerosugar> But Pat your not going to 100% platinum your first blind play through. Lol
[1:10:27] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Just off of these first 12  hours is this a game you can see yourself coming back and streaming over and over again?
[1:10:28] <+Dommykins> holy shit
[1:10:28] <%abakkus> i still periodically go back and watch the old soulsborne LPs on the old channel, so yeah, thats evergreen content for sure

[1:10:58] <%HotMafia81> Not like anyone wants to release anything in the wake of Elden Ring anyway (except Horizon FW lol)
[1:11:03] <+MamoruTheRed> Forgive my ignorance, I obtained from watching most of the stream yesterday, but did pat beat the night time boss that's roaming around?
[1:11:05] <%zentheman01> S P E E D

[1:11:39] <xxHungryxx> "What's that smell? IT'S BLOOOOD!"
[1:11:40] <%Mister_McDerp> MONKE
[1:11:41] <+alphonseisbest> You mean SLOWborne right? lmao Kappa
[1:11:41] <+RobbedGamer> Whoever decides the release days for horizon games should really find a new job.
[1:11:47] <Maids4lyfe> imagine if we could get an Eldenborne or Blood Ring
[1:11:51] <razieltano123> Hey Chat. The game sound stutters on my end. Any on your end?

[1:12:48] <%linSP> is it the elden ring
[1:12:48] <%notsoy> who wants to bet this is the hidden dungeon that has the bafmodad for the secret ending

[1:13:04] <%CopperTucker> yeah, emote only is fine
[1:13:05] <$vehementvadr> by the way, I shattered your mother's elden ringussy last night
[1:13:08] <Maids4lyfe> LUL
[1:13:10] <Minorou> it's a dense open world game, missing things is always going to happen
[1:13:10] <Aussie_Manny> spoilers

[1:13:40] <MaritimeSpanker> I've been spoiled on some things, but I don't care about them myself
[1:13:43] <Aussie_Manny> We're good boys and girls here in chat. Some of us are just over-excited.
[1:13:47] <MaritimeSpanker> but you don't spoil shit for people that DO care
[1:13:48] <%holydeviant1> Taking a break, just passed the Bridge of Sacrifice and excited for my first REAL ASS DUNGEON

[1:14:34] <+Drspiderskull92> DA DA AAA
[1:14:36] <%abakkus> just fuck their bones all up
[1:14:42] <+allups> aye im doing faith too
[1:14:42] <%Brassnarwhal> i thought equip weight was attached to strength now?
[1:14:46] <razieltano123> My neck must be strong to wear a hat style of logic.
[1:14:52] <+allups> faith and str
[1:14:52] <@Spydurman> you checked that skeleton!
[1:14:55] <%Brassnarwhal> I'm doing faith strength
[1:15:00] <MaritimeSpanker> God I hope they don't Nerf Faith in this game
[1:15:01] <+zoe_wynnes> i started it as wretch and im 36 levels in and i havent put anything  into health yet this game is rough when your hp is at base stats the whole time
[1:15:02] <%Mister_McDerp> I want to go faith solely for that gold halberd
[1:15:03] <@GeneralSCPatton> There's a skeletons summon that has the reanimation.
[1:15:07] <MaritimeSpanker> I fucking love faith builds
[1:15:13] <+SaintSalted> its not
[1:15:13] <razz_zie> Its crazy annoying that the best thing about Souls game is exploration and discovery, while the online community goes ham on backseating. This game seems like would be a nightmare to stream
[1:15:13] <%TG_Cid11> there are so many weapons that scale with 3 stats
[1:15:14] <digaogrunge> It is
[1:15:14] <LunarRemix> It was in the network test
[1:15:14] <+kknutson4> Str/Int or Str/Faith better?
[1:15:16] <OperatorPlease> there might be something like a "madness" element, who knows
[1:15:16] <%tusk102> equip load is endurance
[1:15:16] <adithehella> Has Pat killed the grafted spider boss yet :0
[1:15:16] <%holydeviant1> By the way, it looks more and more like Vaati's "No more babies" theory is true. I found an egg and it's like "yeah this will never ever hatch"
[1:15:16] <%linSP> where’s the skill faith weapon at
[1:15:16] <G_476> they reverted it from the CNT
[1:15:19] <+allups> nah its endurance
[1:15:20] <LunarRemix> They changed it on release
[1:15:22] <%notsoy> whoever said that is dum
[1:15:22] <+SaintSalted> it used to be in the tests tho
[1:15:24] <+Local16> Poison is under faith apparently and it's pretty damn good
[1:15:25] <luciluxlu0> it some weird network test stuff
[1:15:30] <%Brassnarwhal> @g_476 did they really?
[1:15:35] <+Them00n> I hope magic gets more than blue sparkles though.
[1:15:39] <@GeneralSCPatton> I also thought that strength affected equip load. I have no idea where I first heard it from, but I'm mad now.
[1:15:40] <+SaintSalted> well arcane too
[1:15:43] <%Brassnarwhal> bruh they reverted it rip
[1:15:44] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt I like the big strong and big strong + fire/lightning = even bigger stronker
[1:15:47] <+dreadd_wolfsbane> That was CNT only
[1:15:49] <%daemonazaezal> Resistance?
[1:15:49] <%linSP> That’s why it was a test I guess
[1:15:50] <%tusk102> @Them00n IT SUPER DOES
[1:15:51] <+SaintSalted> arcane seems to be bleed and poison
[1:15:51] <Maids4lyfe> strength is for heavy weapons, endurance for heavy armor
[1:15:52] <+dreadd_wolfsbane> They reverted it
[1:15:53] <WippaDippa> you gotta have faith
[1:15:53] <+zaddyforever> @linsp i’ve found a faith weapon in the southern part of the map
[1:15:53] <projecthazoid> When the human skeleton leaves it skin it becomes 1.25 times taller
[1:15:55] <%bundle_of_herbs> but gravity is magic i think
[1:15:55] <%zentheman01> Paladin build getting some love, here's to all my STR/CHAds
[1:15:56] <NoodleFrosty> So is Faith the variety/utility now while Magic is raw damage?
[1:16:00] <LunarRemix> It was pretty good on release DS2
[1:16:03] <Sunstalker> I miss the fucking Gravesword miracles so much
[1:16:09] <%linSP> @zaddyforever thanks!
[1:16:10] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt Like the basic bitch poison spray from the other games? Great faith spell in this
[1:16:13] <+tempestzephyr> the Church is toxic
[1:16:14] <OperatorPlease> no faith gets the pyromancies now
[1:16:15] <%PrimalDweeb> Poison being under faith sounds accurate to me. LUL
[1:16:17] <%Brassnarwhal> @maids4lyfe yes but in the network test they had it the way i said
[1:16:18] <xxHungryxx> Magic builds of any kind seem really good in this game
[1:16:18] <LunarRemix> Man what the fuck were they thinking with Faith and even magic on DS3
[1:16:19] <+Jeshk0> LUL
[1:16:23] <@Spydurman> wait, go back. You missed the buttfuck dungeon shield
[1:16:23] <Chaos_Aether> Headshot

[1:16:29] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> so we've found Paiges special lewd dungeon
[1:16:30] <Aussie_Manny> Wait wait wait... FAITH helps POISON RESISTANCE?? What kinda snake oil salesman bullshit is THAT?? finoACK

[1:16:41] <+MorelK> ok bihorn pat
[1:16:42] <%Ironbuttz> nice antennae dude
[1:16:43] <Hepathos87> he drink lot of milk
[1:16:43] <%abakkus> arrows can be a hat
[1:16:44] <MaritimeSpanker> much better than just "clean white"
[1:16:46] <ThirdPersonPhil> That skeleton has terrifc aim

[1:17:04] <MaritimeSpanker> hey man, gotta have fun in some way when you're a bones
[1:17:05] <Chaos_Aether> yes
[1:17:09] <%Brassnarwhal> faith healers treat poison all the time and people often survive and that's enough correlation to count
[1:17:09] <PanicSwytch> LUL
[1:17:10] <razieltano123> I saw it too.
[1:17:11] <%zentheman01> that skeleton doesn't want to be a dungeon monster, he wants to be an idol
[1:17:17] <haisho> he's a skeleton he does what he wants
[1:17:23] <MaritimeSpanker> all women can't be paige and love skeletone boners
[1:17:23] <xxHungryxx> Paladin slays undead
[1:17:23] <%SuckerPunchSyd> That skeleton has got jukes

[1:17:28] <razz_zie> Is there a way to keep the arrow in your head? Possibly?
[1:17:29] <sweatch0> :)
[1:17:34] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I wouldn't trust chat either
[1:17:37] <%PrimalDweeb> LUL
[1:17:39] <MaritimeSpanker> Nobody loves skeletons like paige
[1:17:41] <%karovus> nobody loves skeletons like paige does
[1:17:44] <%Mister_McDerp> skellies are the best
[1:17:44] <%zentheman01> I also love snoteleks
[1:17:48] <Aussie_Manny> Paige lusts skeletons. It's... wack.
[1:17:52] <%holydeviant1> Dude I would play a Castlevania that is LITERALLY ALL SKELETONS, that shit would be dope
[1:17:54] <ExpressNode> Its great that you love skeletons because in another 100 years you will be one
[1:17:54] <+alphonseisbest> @PatStaresAt just curious why not make the claymore bleed, its not superslow i thought
[1:17:54] <%PrimalDweeb> Paige truly loves the bone
[1:17:59] <WippaDippa> i play the astro class and theres no cards 0/10

[1:18:50] <+kknutson4> Have there been any Illusionary Walls in this game at all?
[1:18:51] <%Brassnarwhal> Pat I'm really sorry that every time i ask a question or ask for a clarification it turns into fear of gaslighting, I'm really not doing it on purpose
[1:18:56] <LunarRemix> You're going to reach the endgame and people will be asking why are you not using the Holy Nuke miracle you get from the Actual Pope in the secret Bloodborne area
[1:19:05] <%RayReborne> pat i saw you fall for the Warp chest to the kine and i FELL FOR IT CUZ I FORGOT

[1:47:11] <Saltmeisterr> hemmy wammo
[1:47:30] <guffbud> Just went past a horse jump under the bridge
[1:47:32] <+dreadd_wolfsbane> You don’t have to do the math. Heavy load = fat roll
[1:47:33] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you can craft healing berries for the horse also
[1:47:47] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt I think what that person meant was, why do you need percentages if it straight out tells you?
[1:47:52] <Aussie_Manny> nice drop
[1:47:58] <$AgentZombieMan1> Can you name the horse?
[1:48:11] <%notsoy> no, it is always named torrent
[1:48:18] <+Brazuka91> i heard fall damage is almost non existant. is that true?
[1:48:20] <Aussie_Manny> Torrent.
[1:48:31] <Aussie_Manny> But buy the game tho.

[2:16:33] <%LorcaNomad> wow poison does almost nothing to the player huh
[2:16:41] <Frranky> lifehack: if you're ever worried about poison just poison yourself and you won't be worried anymore

[2:16:55] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> This is like the living failures fight
[2:16:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt HOLY CRAP, they released a Babylon's Fall Demo... just in time to talk about it on the podcast
[2:17:06] <Omenaire_> green poison
[2:17:06] <+dreadd_wolfsbane> I’m sure the rot will be way worse
[2:17:11] <ZE_Count> faith/poison is a interesting build
[2:17:14] <+eanscrale> So I'm guessing blight is poison but worse.
[2:17:15] <%notsoy> solarbeams straight out of pokemon

[2:17:56] <deviljhojho_> kind of a slugfest
[2:17:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> since I don't have Elden Ring, I guess I will have to test out the misery of Babylon's Fall

[2:18:26] <Shiibbae> poisonPOISON poison
[2:18:36] <MaritimeSpanker> Feels like it could be useful
[2:18:47] <MaritimeSpanker> those flowers might've been some foreshadowing or something
[2:19:03] <%Monkeyweed21> @eanscrale MUCH stronger and it lasts forever, even if you start at full health and chug flasks it'll probably still kill you
[2:19:14] <MaritimeSpanker> Radical pat
[2:19:20] <xxHungryxx> I love the hood
[2:19:33] <rosemon5001> wich of the ninja turtles did you kill to get that shield?

[2:19:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I feel I would also want to do poison, as a Black PLayer in Magic
[2:19:46] <+breakersnap> pat should wear his cloak as well
[2:19:55] <+eanscrale> @Monkeyweed21 so it's the red comet of status effect compared to the basic green zaku
[2:20:01] <%daemonazaezal> you know pat
[2:20:07] <%zarkazeon> hey pat you CAN get in that moat at the castle. You'll die but you might see something nuts.

[2:34:14] <%daemonazaezal> like gargoyle knight?
[2:34:15] <%strakillias> No Pat you will become a professional Spelunker and you will like it
[2:34:16] <Aussie_Manny> Yahoo! Yippee!
[2:34:25] <%twoto858> I'm a sucker for dungeon crawling, so this game is hitting my weak spot
[2:34:28] <Aussie_Manny> Huh?
[2:34:29] <kingmemelord97> man they should have named this game eldan caves
[2:34:35] <%holydeviant1> I am so lost in the Morne Castle. I cannot find the boss. Send hel,
[2:34:41] <feaxel> jump in hole!
[2:34:42] <pi_in_the_sci> I think you just didn't go high enough for the real secret
[2:34:48] <Sigma_190_Beta> There was a hidden point up higher on the shaft.
[2:34:51] <Pt_Kamen> so Vati has work to do until end of times
[2:34:53] <Sigma_190_Beta> The Secret was higher.
[2:35:10] <%LorcaNomad> I thought you'd been here already yesterday because the elevator looked almost identical
[2:35:14] <%gitgouda> stormveil
[2:35:14] <+crimsonomen0> So is the big dumb bullshit at the end of this game gonna be aliens, a la Bloodborne?
[2:35:15] <%holydeviant1> Coop is really good for getting Runes, by the way. You don't lose any when you die in Coop.
[2:35:25] <%TG_Cid11> storm castle is a big dungeon
[2:35:31] <%Monkeyweed21> I went into a hole and found map lies
[2:35:33] <Hellhound90008> @PatStaresAt would you say that this game would be people who dont typically like dark souls games?
[2:35:38] <xxHungryxx> need to get that lantern at some point
[2:35:41] <%TG_Cid11> I would say so
[2:35:42] <%holydeviant1> Kinda big? Can't find the boss myself.
[2:35:45] <+SaintSalted> mrone is medium
[2:35:47] <tanarath> Grind offscreen or whatever
[2:35:54] <XxMoliciousxX> co-op with woolie
[2:36:08] <%twoto858> Storm Castle is apparently the size of ALL of Boletaria
[2:36:10] <rufus2k2> is there anything in the pit?
[2:36:11] <tanarath> Really! And we know you did.
[2:36:13] <%daemonazaezal> if this was ds1-2 youd have flown of the walls on that drop
[2:36:13] <%linSP> is the big map the only map
[2:36:14] <%topendbuzza> still rolling and not jumping i see
[2:36:23] <feaxel> CHICKEN MAN ARE THE BEST MAN
[2:36:27] <%LorcaNomad> what the fuck
[2:36:30] <Willowight> underground birds?
[2:36:42] <%Monkeyweed21> there's a lot there
[2:36:43] <%TG_Cid11> I think i made if half way through in about an hour
[2:36:54] <+crimsonomen0> Damn dudes just at work and you backstab him.
[2:36:59] <%Monkeyweed21> You havent even seen the real map lies yet
[2:37:01] <+twdlrr> oh shit they are chickens
[2:37:07] <%dalmek> Dark Souls 4 but it's actually 4 Dark Souls in length
[2:37:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> 3 Dark Souls games in a trenchcoat
[2:37:41] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Yes
[2:37:43] <luciluxlu0> yes
[2:37:47] <%TG_Cid11> dark souls 4 ever
[2:37:47] <MechanizedGentleman> "Its like dark souls" uh huh, got it
[2:37:49] <+MamoruTheRed> like a greatest hits
[2:37:49] <fierysnowflakes> Dark Souls x Sekiro but also squared
[2:37:53] <Ghufufin> its a tribute and a continuation?
[2:37:58] <XxMoliciousxX> oh cus it has all the mechanics from all the games
[2:38:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> Vincent Adultsouls
[2:38:01] <%spitelite> yes its like Big dark souls
[2:38:02] <Minorou> the sheer girth of this game
[2:38:03] <radiorosewater> that crit heal talisman is putting in work
[2:38:07] <xxHungryxx> Crit heals 👌
[2:38:09] <%Monkeyweed21> you have no idea how big
[2:38:12] <jtsoppy137> do da heal man
[2:38:14] <%twoto858> WORDS
[2:38:17] <Omenaire_> this game is like dark souls with big bronze balls
[2:38:19] <%Monkeyweed21> I HAVE NO IDEA HOW BIG TOO
[2:38:19] <Tenebrae94> why did you heal when you reposted?
[2:38:20] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt People feared that Elden Ring would just be Darksouls but bigger, does it actually do more in your opinion?
[2:38:22] <SomeAsianDood> so what you're telling me is this is a "best of darksouls" crammed jnto an open world
[2:38:26] <rufus2k2> no minimap?
[2:38:31] <Makr0ss> feels a bit like darksouls made by bluepoint
[2:38:34] <%za7az> I agree, be wary of conservatives LUL
[2:38:35] <XxMoliciousxX> how much does that heal for?
[2:38:39] <+Them00n> Even before Souls games From Soft was very practiced at asset recycling, they're ability to recycle content and make it good are what allowed this game to exist.
[2:38:47] <%topendbuzza> he sad
[2:39:17] <%X2Eliah> what sword is Pat using again?
[2:39:31] <xxHungryxx> claymore
[2:39:35] <%Monkeyweed21> I still cant believe Patches sells bonfire mimics
[2:39:38] <%X2Eliah> Naw this is asset upcycling
[2:39:38] <XxMoliciousxX> good ol claymore
[2:39:49] <%X2Eliah> k thnx
[2:39:50] <Gray_LoFi> Yeah I think that Forest Guardian boss is literally just Gyoubu, but who gives a shit
[2:39:50] <%Monkeyweed21> they've used the same rat model since like 2011 lol
[2:40:00] <+Them00n> I agree, that was exactly my point
[2:40:05] <+Jeshk0> making assets is a lot of work, so i dont really care if they reuse some
[2:40:11] <Kale_Chip> i don't understand people who get mad about asset reusing
[2:40:16] <Astrophizz> just Yakuza things
[2:40:19] <adithehella> oh geez
[2:40:20] <%HotMafia81> Asset recycling happens at every large studio
[2:40:20] <+FattimusSlime> Reusing assets from older games is fine if it frees them up to make more new shit -- game feels stuffed.
[2:40:20] <%Monkeyweed21> Skeletons have had the same moveset for like 13 years now
[2:40:21] <Ghufufin> historically accurate mine
[2:40:22] <AllenDeadman> what the HELL are those?
[2:40:23] <%twoto858> RIP
[2:40:23] <five_foo> !uptime
[2:40:23] <@Moobot> @five_foo I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 40m.
[2:40:23] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat got over confident
[2:40:23] <+FattimusSlime> Which is great.
[2:40:25] <%notsoy> asset reuse is awesome, look at yakuza
[2:40:26] <KasiCrafter> The SaltyBet salt mines sure looks busy today
[2:40:35] <%daemonazaezal> this is when i fell i love with quickshot bow
[2:40:39] <xxHungryxx> Fireball those fucks
[2:40:59] <feaxel> i konow the chicken man are probably harpies, but chicken men is cooler
[2:41:04] <%slandracon> You know the weirdest thing is: noone has said"The fuck are these chimera bastards" instead they've said "the servants rose up". so these guys are natural here?
[2:41:15] <%daemonazaezal> I HATE THEIR FACES
[2:41:20] <KasiCrafter> Shortcut: just jump 4Head
[2:41:27] <%Nobrev> the massive amounts of falling you can do in this game without taking damage is gonna throw me off for months
[2:41:35] <%Monkeyweed21> @slandracon Demi-humans appear to be native to Limgrave
[2:41:41] <xxHungryxx> chicken for dinner
[2:43:14] <Aussie_Manny> 🐢
[2:43:16] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Turtle is life
[2:43:18] <+TheMeromex> u say that cuz u look like master roshi
[2:43:20] <+Dommykins> Turtle design is cool but doesn't really go with your look at all.
[2:43:25] <%topendbuzza> just think it is an orb
[2:43:25] <%Monkeyweed21> normal shield are for cowards
[2:43:31] <%sniffy77> Man im seeing some really weird shit in the weeping peninsula
[2:43:33] <guffbud> Can’t you fashion souls at a grace
[2:43:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> I just found a thing that teleported me across the map, directly behind a giant badass
[2:43:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> im scared chat
[2:43:43] <%holydeviant1> HOLY SHIT YOU CAN MANUALLY AIM CROSSBOWS NOW
[2:43:43] <deviljhojho_> scalies rise up

[2:44:44] <Astrophizz> sounds compressed
[2:44:44] <ARDM112> River anchors have four tips, sea anchors have two
[2:44:44] <seer0ftime> sounds fine

[2:45:07] <%daemonazaezal> pyro is faith
[2:45:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> zero crust on my end
[2:45:08] <+mace210> refresh or check resolution
[2:45:11] <+ConnieETC> It’s perfect
[2:45:16] <+mace210> 4Heads
[2:45:16] <tanarath> Reload the stream & increase the bitrate?
[2:45:17] <seer0ftime> none crust
[2:45:18] <Zeif00> it sounds fine, just refresh
[2:45:18] <%X2Eliah> naw the music just has a lot of moaning layers, twitch isnt great at that kind of constant sound
[2:45:19] <@Spydurman> it's fine for me
[2:45:22] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Nope, it sounds fine
[2:45:22] <+Dommykins> sounds fine
[2:45:22] <sweatch0> some chatters are frying chicken i think
[2:45:23] <%IvanMistwalker> its fine for me
[2:45:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> the audio is fine. If people are having audio issues it must be on their side
[2:45:25] <PanicSwytch> It’s fine for me
[2:45:28] <Astrophizz> I meant like low bitrate, sometimes it's crunchy
[2:45:28] <+TheMeromex> try switching the low latency in advance twitch settings that sometimes messes with the sound
[2:45:32] <radiorosewater> it's fine
[2:45:40] <Maids4lyfe> check your resolution, run the stream on source or refresh
[2:45:42] <xxHungryxx> 👍
[2:45:50] <Astrophizz> yeah probably effects stacking up and twitch crushing it
[2:45:51] <tigerfang86> moaning usedSweat
[2:45:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think people are fucking with you to try and get you to freak out.
[2:45:58] <%HotMafia81> Sounds fine to me
[2:46:03] <%Monkeyweed21> low latency mode really screws with moody music like this
[2:46:09] <%slandracon> whTs end time? @patstaresat
[2:46:36] <deviljhojho_> some old fuck
[2:46:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ker-YOLO

[2:46:44] <%topendbuzza> sir you have a tree on you
[2:46:45] <Ner234> No one is messing with Pat. Twitch really has a problem with some sounds.
[2:46:50] <Aussie_Manny> tree boy
[2:46:52] <TMcT45> Harold
[2:46:53] <xxHungryxx> I liked his spear tho
[2:46:53] <%Monkeyweed21> oh shit an Elezen
[2:46:55] <Hepathos87> treemans
[2:46:59] <MechanizedGentleman> wish I was a tree
[2:46:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> He Was Groot
[2:47:05] <Jewoodsforreal> You just fought John Tree
[2:47:09] <SomeAsianDood> looks like a mini Margit
[2:47:18] <kingmemelord97> fluttershy is a tree
[2:47:33] <Makr0ss> does this game need gliding or something like that?
[2:47:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> What's a fluttershy
[2:47:56] <+mace210> @rumtumtugnutz i think its pronounced "I am Groot"
[2:48:23] <%strakillias> The next stop will most likely be another cave judging by the rest of this stream
[2:48:24] <%greasypete00> have you looked at the erdtree here yet
[2:48:28] <Scuura> Has Pat done Stormveil Castle?
[2:48:51] <MaritimeSpanker> oooooh
[2:48:53] <%gitgouda> OHHHHHHHHHHHH
[2:48:53] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt would like to know where the flask is or nah?

[2:49:14] <%twoto858> OHHHH ELDEN RING
[2:49:15] <%RigmaroleHM> So in this world, being a vegetarian is sacriligious?
[2:49:15] <MechanizedGentleman> that means the tree man you murdered was a holy man
[2:49:18] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Lifa Tree?
[2:49:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> The plants are making angel dust
[2:49:22] <%Mister_McDerp> and plants are poison therefore poison is holy
[2:49:25] <Grave_Titan_D> full of holes?
[2:49:27] <XxMoliciousxX> the plants are trying to summon?
[2:49:41] <Aussie_Manny> Solid 25% HP heal. Jeez.
[2:49:52] <Kale_Chip> @Mister_McDerp does that make poison swamps holy ground?
[2:50:04] <dan_g_v> zombos
[2:50:05] <Zourath> @MechanizedGentleman Makes sense, since it covered itself in holy fire during the second phase.
[2:50:16] <xxHungryxx> filthy undead
[2:50:19] <spacecatstreams> thats neat
[2:50:22] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> You can break their bones quite quickly
[2:50:36] <%phytopath> Haz a Prime sub. I finally got my Twitch account to re-link.

[3:16:07] <Aussie_Manny> "I'm sure there's enough in the game." Yeah, that's what I thought about One Third Umbilical Cords...

[3:16:40] <%PrimalDweeb> He's right
[3:16:42] <%Monkeyweed21> but its possible to miss 2
[3:16:45] <%UvBenServed> Math is hard
[3:16:47] <MaritimeSpanker> which I dont think had them all, but I'm not sure actually
[3:17:02] <%Dakuu75> 2 handing a weapons is always stronger, right?
[3:17:30] <HoneySweetSugarBeat> These skeletons are quite noisy
[3:17:34] <%gitgouda> im starting to believe there isnt.
[3:17:37] <Ner234> LUL That would be the ultimate troll
[3:17:38] <MaritimeSpanker> is Weapon durability still a thing to even worry a little bit about?
[3:17:39] <+trizetacannon44> Worse, there is only one
[3:17:43] <stormhawk9891> Watch there be just 1 in the entire game
[3:17:44] <%YakumoYomi> No, there will be exactly ONE
[3:17:48] <Sunstalker> Invisible walls only in NG+ Kappa
[3:17:48] <%Monkeyweed21> you've already missed 17 illusory walls
[3:17:49] <Aussie_Manny> I'm just thinkin', I wouldn't put it past this game to lock you out of stuff by limiting item accessibility.
[3:17:49] <Zayasu> i'm so sick of the pc version. just gonna spoil myself now. better experience than playing this garbage
[3:17:52] <luciluxlu0> what about the one you missed?
[3:17:55] <guffbud> Why are all skeletons in from soft games bigger than any other human
[3:17:56] <%PrimalDweeb> If there isn't a single invisible wall in this game, good on From Soft for playing the long game. LUL
[3:17:58] <chowndawg> apparently there are some with crazy stuff behind them
[3:18:02] <%gitgouda> watch it be only 2 hidden doors and they are both to secret bosses.
[3:18:07] <jubejube56> Maybe the lands between are between 2 invisible walls
[3:18:08] <ArOne_Start> drawing blood from skeles

[3:29:54] <razieltano123> @PatStaresAt Instead of Oleg. Summoning a hoard may help.
[3:29:56] <%GutsForDinner> the timing on swings for bosses in this game feels like PURPOSE made to fuck with the play patterns you develop through Dark Souls
[3:30:08] <MaritimeSpanker> @enerkaizer from DS1
[3:30:11] <%SWFanatic> Why plant mad?

[3:49:00] <heartlesshealer> map is so damn huge
[3:49:17] <+silvery_cricket> oh they were statues
[3:49:21] <guffbud> You’ve not even seen half the map and it could get bigger. This is a fucking huge map
[3:49:26] <+mace210> fuck dragon???
[3:49:29] <Noogiez> shoot it
[3:49:31] <seer0ftime> absolute size of that lad

[3:49:35] <%LorcaNomad> holy shit that thing's HUGE
[3:49:38] <civilized_worm12> biggest fuck dragon monkaS

[3:49:41] <guffbud> Shoot it with your bow
[3:49:41] <%abakkus> dragon corpse?
[3:49:51] <%IvanMistwalker> The Drussy
[3:49:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> the fact that the map expands is wild
[3:49:56] <sirjames079> Is that thing bigger than Dragon God?
[3:49:56] <XxMoliciousxX> there's going to be some tumbling speedrun strat to get down there
[3:49:58] <%tetraes> @PatStaresAt  i think one of my favorite things about this game is its use of color
[3:50:03] <heartlesshealer> oh yeah, test the regen rate
[3:50:04] <BKWordguy> I can't wait for the hours-long video essays explaining the lore and plot.
[3:50:13] <razieltano123> @PatStaresAt That was a crazy teleport holy hell.

[3:50:25] <%Monkeyweed21> @PrimalDweeb i fuckin bet there are above ground zones that arent are on the map too, like sky islands or the moon
[3:50:35] <+Them00n> it's about the same as that ring in DS2
[3:50:40] <+tempestzephyr> regen build?
[3:50:42] <%JoshManVGH> Are ashes of war a One Time Use?
[3:50:43] <%HiroProtagonest> That's a lot faster than the Restoration Ring from DS2
[3:50:49] <heartlesshealer> only left to figure out is if it's percentage based or a hard number
[3:50:55] <%PrimalDweeb> @Monkeyweed21 Wouldn't be surprised
[3:51:36] <+sevorai> Wow they weren't kididng about the size of storm veil castle, just accidently stumbled into last boss
[3:51:40] <%Monkeyweed21> @PrimalDweeb watch it be some shit like "congrats on beating the god creator, you've unlocked the dark world

[3:51:46] <%walternatorz> infinite rats
[3:51:53] <ultrabonezone> are those just ds3 rats?

[4:16:20] <TioXyco> @WackyGear souls games have a auto save feature at all times. there's no such thing as save scumming your way outta making enemies
[4:16:20] <%josnotforlewd> Maybe she wants to be here
[4:16:24] <%notsoy> WELP
[4:16:24] <guffbud> She did say something before she became hostile
[4:16:25] <Gnukko88> i'm afraid she's aggro'ed

[4:16:46] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt check her usual spot maybe?
[4:16:48] <BlueBiscuitGT> Of course it's her, did u forget how she looked like?
[4:16:48] <%josnotforlewd> I guess this is how you get the blorbo shitto ending
[4:16:48] <deviljhojho_> nice
[4:16:50] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I like the people telling Pat to reload a save in a FromSoft game.
[4:16:51] <sothatsprettybrutal> and so the thread of prophecy is severed
[4:16:55] <otakon17> wait
[4:16:56] <Tesseractor> wtf

[4:17:02] <heartlesshealer> why would she?
[4:17:02] <penitentpendant> She did say 'her death would only be temporary'
[4:17:03] <+FattimusSlime> Oh well, that's that then.
[4:17:03] <%PrimalDweeb> Well, that was weird
[4:17:03] <MaritimeSpanker> did you just earn "sin" or some such?
[4:17:04] <MaraSmug> time to restart
[4:17:04] <stevenellis386> awwwww

[4:17:11] <+Them00n> RIP true ending probably, oh well
[4:17:11] <otakon17> rmember she said her death was only TEMPORARY
[4:17:11] <Mevdik> bih was broke
[4:17:12] <Tooniearcade> O
[4:17:13] <+allups> he cant just reload
[4:17:18] <+Shoosler> prob should have read that first
[4:17:18] <SIydoc> maybe try going to where she normally is
[4:17:19] <MaritimeSpanker> I have no fucking idea what you were supposed to do there
[4:17:21] <%LorcaNomad> thanks miyazaki
[4:17:22] <fierysnowflakes> YOU GET NOTHING, YOU LOSE, GOOD DAY SIR
[4:17:24] <luciluxlu0> check and see if the first place if that is truly her
[4:17:26] <otakon17> she RESPAWNED elsewhere
[4:17:26] <%slandracon> COULD YOU HAVE SHOT THE CRYSTALS
[4:17:33] <MaritimeSpanker> Pat, that was in the network test
[4:17:34] <zanzibarian_hamster> Well it's not like you're doing magic anyway right?
[4:17:35] <guffbud> Was it the dude from the church?
[4:17:37] <otakon17> I bet she's there now
[4:17:37] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> well you already killed her lol
[4:17:38] <MaritimeSpanker> she might not regularily BE there
[4:17:42] <BlueBiscuitGT> where pumpikin was
[4:17:44] <MaritimeSpanker> oh, welp
[4:17:45] <otakon17> well what the fuck
[4:17:46] <Tesseractor> shit
[4:17:46] <%YakumoYomi> She said "My death would only be temporary". Does that mean she comes back later?
[4:17:55] <%josnotforlewd> Now steal her books
[4:17:55] <42nfl19> Wait so Pat decided to attack a person bound to a wall?
[4:17:59] <AllenDeadman> maybe you were supposed to come here, see she was gone, and then go save her?
[4:18:01] <AllenDeadman> idk
[4:18:07] <radiorosewater> This NPC cannot be interacted with at this time. She does not come back.
[4:18:07] <@GeneralSCPatton> Now you can only get the Scrimblo'd Eggs Ending
[4:18:09] <%The_Protagonist> ttthhhaaaaaaaat might be a bug
[4:18:10] <+SaintSalted> if you go back she come back but wont talk to you
[4:18:10] <guffbud> No more quest for you
[4:18:10] <deviljhojho_> confusing interactions in a fromsoft game? incredible
[4:18:11] <+redjack108> I mean she v explicitly said she was a witch. You found her being tortured in a place called witch-bane ruins. She has the same mask and clothes…
[4:18:15] <TheBlankAce> There's probably a forgiveness mechanic anyway
[4:18:18] <+silvery_cricket> that feels like the game was trying to fuck you up
[4:18:19] <otakon17> @42nfl19 taking to her did nothing
[4:18:19] <+ConnieETC> It is what it is
[4:18:20] <%tetraes> @PatStaresAt  maybe its the case of needing a specific time or clothes
[4:18:21] <heartlesshealer> well, you're dressed like the guys running around killing everyone
[4:18:24] <T_Sasquatch> @42nfl19 yup
[4:18:26] <+Raven_In_A_Tree> scrimblo mcbimblod it
[4:18:30] <%abakkus> she was strung up just like that statue is huh
[4:18:32] <enerkaizer> This feels like something games did in the 90ies. "Wanna know how that obscure nonsense in our game works? buy our strategy guide to find  out!"
[4:18:35] <TioXyco> @TheBlankAce I don't think the dead can forgive you
[4:18:35] <+Them00n> I don't know, From Soft has gotten so obtuse with this stuff I just stop caring after a point
[4:18:39] <penitentpendant> Oh well, onward with other things
[4:18:41] <%Monkeyweed21> its probably something like you missed 2 quests steps that were in other areas or something
[4:18:43] <dan_g_v> did Pat kill another npc?
[4:18:45] <%OrangeMDT> Eh, something to do on the next playthrough SeemsGood
[4:18:49] <%bundle_of_herbs> maybe you would've needed to buy all her spells earlier or smth like that
[4:18:50] <otakon17> man I love the drag attack
[4:19:01] <civilized_worm12> maybe you didn't have to kill her idk
[4:19:02] <penitentpendant> He's reading while driving
[4:19:03] <penitentpendant> Oh no
[4:19:06] <MaesePC> time to reset character
[4:19:06] <MaritimeSpanker> Oh hey, it's that shiel
[4:19:08] <%josnotforlewd> I looked up a guide and it literally says "We don't know what's up with her"
[4:19:08] <%LorcaNomad> fat rolling?
[4:19:09] <heartlesshealer> maybe new game + you can figure it out
[4:19:11] <feaxel> goodbye turtle pat
[4:19:12] <%Monkeyweed21> For all we know Pat just got the good ending for her questline
[4:19:15] <otakon17> I dunno, shields seem kind of useless against most of the bosses this time aroun
[4:19:21] <Parapattern> Looks like a big slice of cheese pizza
[4:19:22] <otakon17> hello Brass Pat
[4:19:34] <MaritimeSpanker> I would imagine so?
[4:19:36] <otakon17> more fisher merchants!
[4:19:38] <Ner234> Guide:"idk lol"
[4:19:38] <+Dommykins> I think you're just fucked?
[4:19:39] <MaritimeSpanker> but I've no clue
[4:19:44] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> well I think you should have given her that book you gave that other guy
[4:19:45] <feaxel> brass pat best pat?
[4:19:46] <%Monkeyweed21> WHO FUCKIN KNOWS
[4:19:46] <DancesWitBalrog> Pat killed a NPC?

[4:20:32] <penitentpendant> Hands free torch?
[4:20:35] <%RigmaroleHM> The flow of time is convoluted?
[4:20:36] <tanarath> That feels like a broken quest
[4:20:40] <Kale_Chip> one chained up and one as a vendor
[4:20:43] <lem______> is this lp land or is it real time
[4:20:46] <MaritimeSpanker> dude, that's just real fuckin' good
[4:20:51] <Kale_Chip> but attacking either will turn them both hostile
[4:20:54] <%PrimalDweeb> Oh, wait; never mind I'm thinking of the chick who gives you the horse.
[4:21:03] <otakon17> this is real time
[4:21:04] <42nfl19> Since you can past time, is there a day night cycle?

[4:28:44] <otakon17> here we go!
[4:28:47] <deviljhojho_> i feel like this whole game is gonna be a "lotta people miss it" experience
[4:28:48] <+silvery_cricket> waste resources on the torch
[4:28:59] <dan_g_v> become woolie
[4:29:03] <%Bullet25fxbx> I didn't look up anything at all about this game before release, and the open-world part of it was such a big shock.
[4:29:17] <otakon17> get your Torrent runnin'
[4:29:21] <penitentpendant> @deviljhojho_ Yup, followed by 'I think I attacked something I shouldn't have'

[4:29:56] <deviljhojho_> @penitentpendant at least that sorta takes me back to xenoblade
[4:30:03] <otakon17> oh yeah did you know you could break those in place ballista the undead use?
[4:30:23] <42nfl19> Have you not found a Faith melee weapon yet?
[4:30:25] <djblue_shift> did you figure out the three wise beasts?
[4:30:31] <Omenaire_> I think my first playthrough I wanna try dex magic
[4:30:39] <MaritimeSpanker> he's found two
[4:30:42] <+aogman> faith FIST
[4:30:42] <otakon17> I think the Tree Sentinel has a Faith armament
[4:30:44] <MaritimeSpanker> one Dex, one Str
[4:30:44] <G_476> You found two!
[4:30:47] <%HiroProtagonest> Strength builds seem to be getting a lot of goodies from the high-magic design actually
[4:30:50] <otakon17> but you need 30 STR to use it
[4:30:55] <%HiroProtagonest> But I still wanna be some sort of sorcerer for once
[4:31:02] <penitentpendant> Yeah, being a 'x stat' build seems to require at least 30 of some stat
[4:31:06] <%CopperTucker> is this more BOTW or Shadow of the Colossus
[4:31:10] <+Shimano232> Pat, do you want to know a place you can go to get a really weird faith weapon?
[4:31:11] <otakon17> yeah friggin' 30 STR seems to be the softcap in this game
[4:31:12] <%BackflipCharm> What about the faith hand stabbos you found?
[4:31:19] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the halberd has the same weapon skill
[4:31:23] <%epide> get past the invader in the hub
[4:31:28] <otakon17> man I hope there's a way to upgrade Torrents jump

[4:31:49] <%holydeviant1> Hey Pat you found a Well yet

[4:42:49] <otakon17> it's an OPTIC BLAST
[4:42:50] <QuandtumTheory> I'm sorry is that just free? It only has a cooldown?
[4:42:52] <skagtheprinceofhell> When is magic not good?
[4:42:56] <+tempestzephyr> good for large targets

[5:34:11] <TheHotStuven> You don't have enough SCARABS!!!
[5:34:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> does that not spawn if you don't have the clue?
[5:34:21] <%HiroProtagonest> It would be nice if this game had a "view in inventory" button for most recent pickup
[5:34:31] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> PUT THAT ON
[5:34:31] <+Jeshk0> LUL

[5:35:09] <Jogsy29__> ive just beaten the tree sentinel at a level 15 cofessor, why the fuck did they put the boss at the beginning of the area lmaoo
[5:35:12] <ExpressNode> Maybe for bigger spells?
[5:35:15] <sonicblade38> probaly only worth on high cost spells
[5:35:23] <%HiroProtagonest> That's a little saved at least
[5:35:23] <%Monkeyweed21> you need a really big penis to wear the scarab helmet
[5:35:23] <KasiCrafter> Try with something that uses a LOT of mana
[5:35:25] <42nfl19> I mean if you are a primary caster, over time probably @patstaresat
[5:35:30] <+Namillus> @Jogsy29__ To teach you to avoid shit
[5:35:36] <+DiceDragonz> pat you run into a chest that teleports you to the FURTHEST corner of the map?
[5:35:40] <AngryPumpkin1995> How's the game holding up on PC?

[5:47:04] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> LUL
[5:47:12] <+SaintSalted> one free hit is mad good
[5:47:43] <XxMoliciousxX> jesus what a mess
[5:47:44] <digaogrunge> It negates one hit, for your char its huge
[5:47:57] <supersargassolagomorph> one free hit, no matter how much damage that hit would do.
[5:47:57] <+xcompleasedad> The guy who does the No Hit Runs is now crumming with happiness over that
[5:47:57] <%Monkeyweed21> imagine 1 free hit on a dragon or something
[5:48:02] <+Beetlewins> That seemed bearly worth it
[5:48:03] <tolloponik> when 5 hits can happen in 1 sec one free hit is not enough
[5:48:05] <dan_g_v> good for massive aoe attacks?
[5:48:06] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Negating one hit is the line between winning and losing

[5:58:50] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> True...bleh.
[5:58:52] <adithehella> is that an ear?
[5:58:53] <%RigmaroleHM> Too bad for them
[5:58:54] <skagtheprinceofhell> It's only spoilers with context
[5:58:56] <42nfl19> fuck those people,spoile the feel of Elden Ring
[5:59:01] <+silvery_cricket> Well tell them to fuck off
[5:59:03] <%walternatorz> are you spoiling the podcast for monday now?
[5:59:04] <TheQuadrupleS> LUL
[5:59:04] <cochramd1992> why is he hungry if he has meat to sell?
[5:59:05] <tolloponik> a merchet with decent customer service... I don't trust you.
[5:59:06] <@Spydurman> can Souls games even be spoiled?
[5:59:07] <critfumble_> anyone found the lucerne? it was in the beta test but i cant find any info on it yet
[5:59:09] <arkv01> the Elden Ring spoilercast is scheduled for May 1st 2022 :)
[5:59:11] <+twdlrr> hungry but selling food?
[5:59:14] <skagtheprinceofhell> I mean, look how big this game is?
[5:59:16] <Zeif00> that depends on how far Woolie ends up getting too
[5:59:16] <%GabeSweetMan> "So I did some grinding off screen" "Pat noo you're ruining the playthrough."
[5:59:16] <%CeeKay_Plays> !uptime
[5:59:17] <@Moobot> @TheCallousKing I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 59m.
[5:59:30] <%OrangeMDT> Just talk about the other games you play
[5:59:31] <Kale_Chip> remember to mark the merchant
[5:59:32] <chhdez> !updog
[5:59:39] <theanora1> it's either going to be the longest CSB, or the shortest as both Pat and Woolie go "Elden Ring is good, we're going to go play it now"
[5:59:50] <%GabeSweetMan> Patches
[5:59:53] <pi_in_the_sci> A story about the new mimic chests would still be fun
[5:59:59] <penitentpendant> The One Merchant... TO SELL THEM ALL
[6:00:03] <+Encrouched> bro lump of flesh? nice
[6:00:14] <chhdez> Patches O' Houlihan
[6:00:14] <Plughead_> has pat beaten Margit yet?
[6:00:16] <+Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> the happiest merchant
[6:00:19] <+Encrouched> its a MIST oppurtunity
[6:00:20] <KasiCrafter> Man...
[6:00:20] <tolloponik> his hunger makes me think he'll devour the others
[6:00:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> mostly just bears
[6:00:29] <Ghufufin> the elevator or the hellevator?
[6:00:30] <adithehella> ah the well
[6:00:33] <42nfl19> So @patstaresat , instead of Mimic Chest we get Teleport chests. Thats a cool change
[6:00:39] <%Monkeyweed21> oh cool pat found a well
[6:00:42] <%holydeviant1> take the eevator
[6:00:44] <%holydeviant1> I DARE YOU

[6:00:46] <%GabeSweetMan> One Merchant to Rule them all and in the darkness- kick them down a pit
[6:00:55] <feaxel> i am really curious about THE ELEVATOR
[6:00:59] <penitentpendant> Angry Bear
[6:01:02] <+Encrouched> he just wants a hug
[6:01:05] <JorgenTheElf> Big bear is big.
[6:01:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> Bears are fast
[6:01:10] <%HiroProtagonest> Bad news bear
[6:01:15] <adithehella> wow
[6:01:15] <%IvanMistwalker> Bear Country
[6:01:17] <civilized_worm12> bear city
[6:01:24] <critfumble_> ursa omega
[6:01:24] <%GabeSweetMan> Bear says naw
[6:01:26] <%JoshManVGH> Bear demands hug!
[6:01:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> for. real.
[6:01:27] <%tusk102> fucking rip

[6:01:33] <bassoontyphoon> Dire bear
[6:01:34] <JorgenTheElf> More at eleven
[6:01:38] <Rbeatononefour> leads you to the place you found the sleeping bear
[6:01:39] <digaogrunge> why
[6:01:39] <+LokimenD> man there's some wipeouts in this game
[6:01:40] <theanora1> marks where the bear will kill you
[6:01:42] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> yes
[6:01:45] <penitentpendant> Seems likely
[6:01:47] <lockhead45> Has he beaten Godrick yet?
[6:01:47] <+silvery_cricket> it attracts bears
[6:01:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> leads you to bear
[6:01:54] <%cade_calrayn> yeah it takes you to the chest with the bear
[6:01:57] <%Sirtimbob> It summons bears
[6:02:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's bears all the way down
[6:02:13] <chhdez> Bearsbearsbearsbearsbears
[6:02:19] <Ner234> How many major bosses has Pat beaten?
[6:02:24] <Kale_Chip> @lockhead45 nope
[6:02:50] <Rbeatononefour> ooooh, bet they taste minty
[6:02:59] <%GabeSweetMan> Game Theory: The bears are in the area that used to be Yharnam what with being able to smell the menstruation.
[6:03:31] <%holydeviant1> This area is pretty easy if you're careful - until you get to the GHOST ZONE
[6:03:34] <sirrice77> Oh yeah have fun in this place
[6:03:36] <%Monkeyweed21> can you ride Torrent down here?
[6:03:39] <goatbile> <3 <3 <3
[6:03:46] <feaxel> this looks sick
[6:03:49] <zenith0111> Game Theory proves if you talk about tits emough people will take you seriously
[6:03:50] <luciluxlu0> it does
[6:03:55] <%Niney_Who> Deal with it. No other dark souls had a map KAppa
[6:03:57] <%Niney_Who> * Kappa
[6:03:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> this is the real dark souls
[6:04:00] <XxMoliciousxX> looks like it'll send you to DS2
[6:04:03] <bassoontyphoon> Basically Holy Water Red Bull
[6:04:18] <+Namillus> uh-oh it's a real overworld zone
[6:04:25] <darce_avidson> it does
[6:04:33] <darce_avidson> doesn't have the map altar thingies tho
[6:04:33] <%holydeviant1> they are very slow
[6:04:39] <Hydrapissed> slime people lol
[6:04:41] <RinWR> That dragon breath is really a problem solver huh
[6:04:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> gross
[6:04:46] <%cade_calrayn> they're called Claymen
[6:04:50] <G_476> You've got a lantern now, right?
[6:04:51] <+xcompleasedad> You got no runes out of that
[6:05:02] <%tusk102> its big
[6:05:06] <KasiCrafter> Lanturn hype?
[6:05:08] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh boy you're finally here, i got here yesterday
[6:05:10] <%RayReborne> @zenith0111 nah,im good. while all in good fun MatPat sparked a wave of idiots over the whole "Sans is Ness" thing lol
[6:05:12] <+xcompleasedad> Actually Blackreach
[6:05:13] <Rbeatononefour> does it go DEEPER, i wonder...
[6:05:20] <%Kemmybelle> Isn’t every place bigger than it looks at first?
[6:05:25] <Paperware> it has its own  map
[6:05:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> many many slime men
[6:05:33] <KasiCrafter> This is "This place might be bigger than I thought" The Game, really
[6:05:38] <%TG_Cid11> that place is massive
[6:05:48] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt giants drop 1k, theres also a consumable that increases runes gained temporarily
[6:05:58] <bassoontyphoon> Dumb question, do you need to constantly be collecting resources as you traverse the map?
[6:06:02] <%SveriSageAdvice> missed an item on your left side
[6:06:09] <Hydrapissed> bloodborne town
[6:06:10] <guffbud> You do get runes tho
[6:06:10] <%JoshManVGH> I can't belive this place has a dwemmer underground...
[6:06:16] <%SveriSageAdvice> yep
[6:06:23] <chhdez> "This is Patches O' Houlihan saying take care of your balls, and they'll take care of you."
[6:06:30] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh three items lmao
[6:06:31] <%Niney_Who> This reminds me of Egypt
[6:06:31] <penitentpendant> Many items!
[6:06:38] <vile_brand> one guys eyes are glowing. is he different?
[6:06:38] <+pabloelenano2> maybe the drop for their spear, but if you already got it then no
[6:06:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> actually 4
[6:06:44] <%gitgouda> OW they stab hard
[6:06:51] <%GabeSweetMan> These might just be the slowest mofos in the universe.

[6:28:25] <%cade_calrayn> yeah it's the Mistwood Outskirts grace
[6:28:30] <slackerunchained> It's almost like it uses your blood to attack or something. :P
[6:28:37] <%bevyrage> does it have a follow-up as well?
[6:28:46] <@PrefectusCorgi> LUL
[6:28:47] <joodatious> i love that your hand slides down the blade to use your blood
[6:28:47] <%cade_calrayn> lol
[6:28:49] <penitentpendant> @trizetacannon44 Now we need to find a way to make the blood combustible
[6:28:58] <slackerunchained> Right down the - Bye-Bye!
[6:29:02] <%Monkeyweed21> Blood magic does tons of damage and  bleed but hurts you too
[6:29:17] <%Monkeyweed21> Arcane is for evil shit
[6:29:21] <Enthaarungscreme> Is there still fat rolling in this?
[6:29:25] <%HiroProtagonest> Oh yeah on my second playthrough of DS2 I wanted to see if Alonne's katana would parry and it turns out you actually do some Lady Maria shit with it
[6:29:37] <%Monkeyweed21> dragon communion uses arcane too
[6:29:42] <zanzibarian_hamster> arcane is for the arcane shit, like esoteric
[6:29:55] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt arcane is luck+some extra shit

[6:30:26] <amishincognito> i betcha
[6:30:37] <+Namillus> Grass Crest Knife
[6:30:43] <%HiroProtagonest> I loved Cathedral Ward
[6:30:43] <42nfl19> So does he eventually take over the Fort?

[6:49:59] <Grave_Titan_D> is this the realm of nyx?
[6:50:01] <%Magewart> HEE HEE
[6:50:01] <%Dakuu75> reminds me of that one chalice dungeon. Theme of space.
[6:50:01] <RinWR> Why are the stars in front of the buildings
[6:50:03] <+pabloelenano2> this place is not underground...
[6:50:04] <T_Sasquatch> Fromsoft is actually GOAT
[6:50:04] <circular7> everything is big to pat Kappa
[6:50:05] <%SWFanatic> try down
[6:50:05] <zero2700> you can see the roots of the tree in the sky
[6:50:06] <%GabeSweetMan> LUL
[6:50:14] <%cade_calrayn> WAIT HOLY SHIT THIS IS ACTUALY AMAUROT
[6:50:17] <+Them00n> So is this area underground?
[6:50:24] <T_Sasquatch> Motherfuckers create genres
[6:50:25] <joodatious> never thought id see souls games do greek stuff
[6:50:39] <joodatious> Minotaur's in Greek
[6:50:41] <joodatious> makes sense
[6:50:41] <eduwardovich> These massive environments must DEVOUR memory.
[6:50:42] <%thbluewarden> seems to be a deer theme here
[6:50:43] <%Monkeyweed21> you dont know that
[6:50:45] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Well there are TONS of animals...these seem like souls of druids
[6:50:47] <%GabeSweetMan> This place might as well be Tartarus.
[6:50:59] <XxMoliciousxX> watch there's a hidden karma system for killing turtles
[6:51:07] <penitentpendant> Good shot
[6:51:07] <%gitgouda> that claw mark i just got it and i like it.
[6:51:17] <Parapattern> Beefy Ghost BOys
[6:51:17] <+Feartheclap> maybe the saxon and vandals dead?
[6:51:33] <vile_brand> behind you
[6:51:40] <%SWFanatic> he vibin
[6:51:44] <otakon17> two hits! low HP!
[6:51:45] <%GabeSweetMan> pat watch out
[6:51:46] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> 3 more were coming up too
[6:51:51] <%D00msDayDan> pat watch out there's a landmine
[6:51:51] <ExpressNode> There were 3 more on the way
[6:51:52] <guffbud> Buffs em
[6:51:54] <%Monkeyweed21> @eduwardovich the reason the PC version runs so bad is ironically enough because its capping its own usage of processing power and vram, hence why people with really fancy PCs are also struggling
[6:51:56] <joodatious> that wolfman is so cool
[6:52:09] <otakon17> those guys with the arrows are BEEF
[6:52:11] <XxMoliciousxX> are they wearing helmets or they have horns?
[6:52:16] <%gitgouda> LUL WHAT
[6:52:17] <%GabeSweetMan> Oh come on!
[6:52:21] <%notsoy> because fromsoft cannot into PCs
[6:52:26] <%Mister_McDerp> wow
[6:52:26] <%GabeSweetMan> DSFix save us!
[6:52:29] <%Treuan> I guess it doesn't wanna burn out cards like New World?
[6:52:29] <zenith0111> PC MUSTARD RACE
[6:52:31] <RinWR> @Monkeyweed21 Got source to share on that?
[6:52:31] <+GallowsDrop> blame it on EZ Anticheat
[6:52:32] <penitentpendant> Oof
[6:52:34] <%SWFanatic> oof
[6:52:36] <skagtheprinceofhell> @notsoy Japan cannot PC*
[6:52:36] <otakon17> yeah the arrows are BULLSHIT
[6:52:40] <joodatious> just get better
[6:52:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think there's a bunch of console optimization stuff they just left in
[6:52:41] <slackerunchained> Some Mongol archers, there.
[6:52:44] <%greasypete00> i want to say that easyanticheat is doing some of the wronging
[6:52:45] <penitentpendant> Seems like it wants a little more HP
[6:52:49] <UncleOliver> cool af thp
[6:52:49] <%SveriSageAdvice> i beat that area at level 23, i spent quite a bit of time there tho lol
[6:52:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> like suspending the process instead of closing it
[6:52:50] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> He has a damn siper scope!
[6:52:52] <otakon17> they're fast, they hit HARD and they're ultra accurate
[6:52:56] <bassoontyphoon> Ok
[6:52:58] <+Abbydyne> this was the first area i went through its nice to see different experiences
[6:52:59] <%SWFanatic> psaBork
[6:53:02] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt I looked at GPU and CPU usage they more or less never peaked even when the game chugged
[6:53:07] <+beavnation> castle?
[6:53:09] <skagtheprinceofhell> @otakon17 They are vikings.
[6:53:13] <+AcidRelic> You still have the MAIN QUEST
[6:53:13] <MajesticBonfire> Oof
[6:53:15] <BlueBiscuitGT> is it time for stormveil castle?
[6:53:22] <%Dakuu75> what level is Pat now?
[6:53:26] <+AcidRelic> that has all been side stuff
[6:53:26] <@GeneralSCPatton> The Underdark seems like it's part of a cycle where everything gets buried by a "fresh" copy of the world
[6:53:29] <%Monkeyweed21> Forcing the game to run uncapped has helped a lot of people with performance problems
[6:53:36] <joodatious> time for demon souls land
[6:53:48] <%tentavision> she's starting in  7 min, yeah
[6:53:49] <+sevorai> Did pat get that handheld lanter form the peninsula area?
[6:53:50] <%hewlettfan96> Hello
[6:53:52] <skagtheprinceofhell> JESUS! I just realized a dude I was watching last night didn't do the thing here they wanted.
[6:53:56] <%GabeSweetMan> How do you force uncapped?
[6:54:04] <zenith0111> Thats kind of why I doubt Devs and promises at times because Devs are using these ultra million dollar equipment and promising my system will run it as intended
[6:54:04] <xxHungryxx> Everytime I come back to this Pat has a sweet new look
[6:54:08] <%SWFanatic> psaDogchamp psaBork because psaDogchamp psaBig <3
[6:54:08] <zhenthrim213> man fuk this place
[6:54:13] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt The stutters have to do with the Shader caching being unoptimized and interacting negatively with the Windows MIDI compatibility feature
[6:54:14] <pi_in_the_sci> there were stairs down behind you
[6:54:19] <%hewlettfan96> This game looks mine blowing
[6:54:19] <%Dakuu75> god bless, the abundance of grace and checkpoints here
[6:54:27] <%GabeSweetMan> WHAT?!
[6:54:31] <jtsoppy137> LUL

[6:54:46] <+GallowsDrop> WINDOWS MIDI???????????
[6:54:46] <%SkyfireHero> pbthhh
[6:54:46] <%notsoy> they don't know shit about PCs lmfao
[6:54:47] <%bevyrage> wait but that's monkeyweed saying this
[6:54:50] <UncleOliver> oh i just saw this dude in the new joel haver video
[6:54:50] <%hewlettfan96> WHAT???? NERD
[6:54:51] <otakon17> good guy commoner
[6:54:53] <skagtheprinceofhell> So, as ususal, the PC players have to fix Japanese mistakes
[6:54:54] <%GabeSweetMan> What it is about WINDOWS AUDIO SETTINGS?!
[6:54:56] <wolfen091> nah, I bet you just need to update iTunes and that will fix its problems
[6:54:59] <zenith0111> 10/10 game dont worry
[6:54:59] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Sekiro DS3 and Tekken have also had this problem in the past
[6:55:00] <%tentavision> oh shit this is the guy from the end of the network test!!
[6:55:09] <+pectusumbra> Patches is that you?
[6:55:11] <%josnotforlewd> :l
[6:55:11] <+TheRagabash> your head is so skinny
[6:55:11] <otakon17> ...wait a second
[6:55:20] <+re_double> MIDI? is this the 90's
[6:55:20] <+Berb64> Guards HATE this one backdoor!
[6:55:24] <zero2700> why in gods name would those two things at all be connected
[6:55:28] <joodatious> @pectusumbra nah we already met patches
[6:55:29] <otakon17> yeah the only way the gate opens is if you have him do it
[6:55:35] <%GabeSweetMan> Windows audio drivers burned my house down, ruined my life, and fucked my wife.
[6:55:37] <%boxisnotconfused> i just wish that this game didn't make all of the npcs invisible intermittently for me on my pc
[6:55:38] <%SWFanatic> psaDogchamp psaBork
[6:55:48] <%boxisnotconfused> and i cant seem to fix it
[6:55:52] <%cylish> Thats a summon pool pat not a stake of merika
[6:55:55] <otakon17> I want that helmet
[6:55:57] <%LorcaNomad> thought the end of the network test was margit
[6:56:02] <xxHungryxx> Have fun storming the castle
[6:56:04] <slackerunchained> Well ONE of us is going to have to CHANGE!
[6:56:05] <%cylish> you gotta activate them
[6:56:10] <lockhead45> pat streaming tomorrow also?
[6:56:14] <skagtheprinceofhell> @zero2700 The same reason why to run Team Fortress 2 they have to have a picture of like a orange or something
[6:56:30] <%Monkeyweed21> I disabled the MIDI compatibilty device and most of my stuttering went away its hilarious
[6:56:30] <vile_brand> i imagine you can
[6:56:33] <zero2700> you can, just fast travel
[6:56:33] <+GojiraKira> Somebody has, from what I've seen
[6:56:35] <penitentpendant> How rare
[6:56:37] <zenith0111> Devs: "Why yes we have to load in and use up your PCs process power for that enemy thousands a miles away but hey at least hes there"
[6:56:46] <%GabeSweetMan> @Monkeyweed21 Where is the setting?
[6:56:49] <+ekodrop> paige?
[6:56:56] <penitentpendant> When in doubt, blame Tekken
[6:57:07] <slackerunchained> Sword-Birb
[6:57:11] <%notsoy> why does the bird have knives lmao
[6:57:11] <ALazo> I wanted to play kof but then games were coming out and I sort of... didn't
[6:57:12] <otakon17> those birds ahve SWORDS for shoes
[6:57:13] <+TheRagabash> THAT BIRD HAS KNIVES ON ITS FEET
[6:57:13] <42nfl19> BLADE LEGS

[6:57:16] <+Grayhammatter> sword birb
[6:57:18] <+GallowsDrop> THEY HAVE BLADE LEGS
[6:57:19] <+TheRagabash> KNIFE BIRD
[6:57:19] <%SWFanatic> damn
[6:57:22] <%cade_calrayn> BIG SWORD BIRB
[6:57:22] <%Dakuu75> This Bird studied the Blade
[6:57:23] <%thbluewarden> the bird is armed!
[6:57:24] <otakon17> it has KNIVES for shoes
[6:57:29] <xxHungryxx> I forgot about these blade birds during the network test lmao
[6:57:29] <%GabeSweetMan> Animals are now dual wielding. GREAT.
[6:57:30] <skagtheprinceofhell> Whoever invented Sword Birds deserves a raise and to be linched
[6:57:30] <+SPARTAN_KD21> y do the birb have sword legs?
[6:57:31] <+Berb64> Bird up!
[6:57:32] <otakon17> woo hoo!
[6:57:33] <Hellhound90008> "look out honey that dog has a knife"
[6:57:36] <CD_Vorporal> last time I was here Pat unlocked dragon breath what'd I miss
[6:57:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @GabeSweetMan device manager, software devices, Microsoft Device Association Root Enumerator and then disable it
[6:57:46] <skagtheprinceofhell> @SPARTAN_KD21 Because war birds are lit
[6:57:46] <T_Sasquatch> Amputee  birds btw
[6:57:51] <penitentpendant> Look, the beast trainer of this castle was very progressive
[6:57:55] <mak0t0yukii> Can't believe a bird like that remind you of chicken
[6:57:55] <arkv01> duhh evolution gave them swords
[6:57:58] <%cade_calrayn> have you never met a goose? A goose would absolutely cut you
[6:58:01] <$vehementvadr> quirked up harpy eagle busting it down (birde style)
[6:58:01] <%thbluewarden> godless killing machines
[6:58:03] <zenith0111> Arent claws just sword hands?
[6:58:06] <+SPARTAN_KD21> @skagtheprinceofhell i accept this premise
[6:58:09] <vile_brand> to fight the orcs that came after smaug
[6:58:09] <otakon17> two with one blow!

[6:58:16] <%SpontaneousC> they're the worst
[6:58:19] <TioXyco> two birds with one sword slash
[6:58:21] <%Monkeyweed21> @GabeSweetMan its for compatibility with MIDI interfaces and old serial ports so unless you use those you should be fine
[6:58:22] <+TheRagabash> The concept of knife birds is soooo disconcerting
[6:58:24] <skagtheprinceofhell> You can actually get those things swords
[6:58:24] <%notsoy> i'm fairly sure you'll be able to get back there
[6:58:30] <otakon17> Church of 'Merica
[6:58:32] <%SWFanatic> Trader Joes?
[6:58:34] <TioXyco> church of muhrica?
[6:58:35] <+ygernesfeld> there's no way that you can't get back there
[6:58:35] <+SPARTAN_KD21> what class are you rolling pat?
[6:58:36] <penitentpendant> Yup, and shield
[6:58:37] <%GabeSweetMan> @Monkeyweed21 Thanks bud, appreciate it
[6:58:38] <xxHungryxx> Chat, how many more beast miracles did Pat get?
[6:58:41] <Kale_Chip> maybe theres a teleport there
[6:58:43] <%YakumoYomi> Church of Murica
[6:58:45] <skagtheprinceofhell> Yeah, it's a dex weapon logicially
[6:58:46] <joodatious> cool if true
[6:58:46] <%slandracon> Perhaps a boss ala asylum demon?
[6:58:51] <penitentpendant> It's a gold greatshield, which is bizarrely called 'light'
[6:58:54] <slackerunchained> Birds with Swords. Cats with torches. Dogs with bees in their mouths so when they bark, they shoot bees at you...
[6:58:57] <%Shubreaker> you see that church in the background? you can climb it
[6:58:59] <+Grayhammatter> went bandit, bows are surprisingly good
[6:59:01] <zenith0111> So what are the confirmed factions so far?
[6:59:06] <otakon17> OH SHIT
[6:59:09] <Grave_Titan_D> I'm willing to bet that you go back there
[6:59:10] <%Monkeyweed21> @GabeSweetMan the Elden Ring sub has threads covering both this fix and fixes for the artificial performance limits
[6:59:10] <%cade_calrayn> Pat's rolling the Pray and Smash class
[6:59:10] <skagtheprinceofhell> Oh he saw you
[6:59:12] <XxMoliciousxX> I wonder where's the zweihander
[6:59:12] <%SWFanatic> choo choo
