[0:03:41] <marvel877> I would, but its kinda hard when I have to fight a 2 year old for control of the tv. I can't keep watching Mickey Mouse Clubhouse everyday dammit!
[0:03:52] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Aria can keep it
[0:03:52] <HaroldDonchee> so is this 8 or 9? I haven't been on a lot

[0:04:56] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Today Leviathan or something else?
[0:05:15] <%maenos2> @knight_verse he said he's gonna stream Mondays while Woolie on honeymoon
[0:05:24] <%DianaTheAscian> What did Pat think of omega?
[0:05:29] <+full_circle> full_circle subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! Owen "Wow"son
[0:05:41] <%Saffry_Ruzin> It was bad
[0:05:43] <%maenos2> @dianatheascian he did not like it.
[0:05:53] <%jtdobyns> was slow and a bit boring and written poorly.
[0:05:53] <%Broand> Broand subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 15 month streak! Hey pat, So I recently of this regional fish dish called a "yewed betta fondue". have you heard of it? It's uh, quite something.
[0:05:55] <%DianaTheAscian> k
[0:05:56] <%Mattais88> Nyreen was cool
[0:05:59] <%chill_o_wisp> whaaaat it's so good tho!
[0:06:24] <Profmcstevie> We just walked forward and shot enemies and Aria bitched, Omega sucked
[0:06:32] <jorniev> what dlc is he gonna play now?
[0:06:34] <%Saffry_Ruzin> The only good part besides Nyreen was that your choices affects Aria in the ending
[0:06:34] <+Soliloquy123> The fact that 95% of it is combat against boring Cerberus enemies does it no favors
[0:06:34] <%dankjerri> dankjerri subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! oh boy, another month! I'm never disappointed when i pop into a stream and everyone is a riot. it was nice hanging out with everyone yesterday and I'm hoping i get some more time off work to level. hope you're doing well!
[0:06:36] <robosqueeb> not enough turian poos poos
[0:06:50] <%InternetShis> Wish we didn't have to bury our gays
[0:06:55] <jorniev> omega is basically only interesting when youre in the afterlife club
[0:07:05] <%Mattais88> How did paige's ff14 streams go?
[0:07:06] <%Saffry_Ruzin> He's probably not going to like Leviathan
[0:07:06] <%jtdobyns> I think Normandy. citadel. and then I think next priority mission
[0:07:26] <robosqueeb> I can't wait for him to get to citadel dlc.
[0:07:28] <%jtdobyns> yeyeeyey
[0:07:28] <%InternetShis> Wait, did he find the Chakram Launcher?
[0:07:31] <jorniev> leviathing shits the bed at the end
[0:07:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ANIMUUUUU

[0:07:47] <@Ranryu692> it's like Pat was waiting for me to get here to start the intro
[0:07:48] <%cooldude69xx> @InternetShis Thats in Omega right?
[0:08:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Leviathan is great wdym?

[0:08:28] <%InternetShis> It was a promotional gun you got from playing the Kingdoms of Amalur demo
[0:08:39] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Chakram Launcher was originally a gun you got from Amalur Reckoning, they put it in Omega for people that didn't get it
[0:08:39] <Profmcstevie> I recognise a FEW lyrics, like mustard and steve buscemi
[0:08:40] <%Arweynn> so, this is what happened last night during paige's stream right? moon-shemi came for paige for talking about nighttime?
[0:08:45] <%InternetShis> But no one heard of it so they made it an Omega findabld
[0:08:46] <%chill_o_wisp> yeah if pat thought omega was slow, he definitely wont like Leviathan. at least the story is cool
[0:08:49] <tanarath> Just in time for vore
[0:08:52] <%InternetShis> findable*
[0:09:00] <%dankjerri> oh my god it does say steve buschemi

[0:10:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @chill_o_wisp no he thought Omrga was tedious because it was just mindless shooting. He will like Leviathan because it's more focused on plot than combat

[0:12:31] <+projectmanatees> Poetry sucks
[0:12:32] <%stantheman_97> poets are very sensitive
[0:12:33] <cpt_langosta> poetry sucks unless it rhymes, and then it still probably sucks

[0:13:40] <knight_verse> Cancel culture is a cancer on society.
[0:13:44] <%stantheman_97> best part about that is vindication
[0:13:47] <Profmcstevie> I liked poetry, writing is cooler though
[0:13:53] <%Broand> WB yeats actually wrote a short memo on the nature of "popular poetry" vs poetry for poets sakes

[0:15:39] <%lumporr> how poetic
[0:15:41] <%dankjerri> rust, dots of neglect to spot the steel, chipping in the edge
[0:15:42] <%Mattais88> Just like the Fortnight champs who walk out back to the league tournament they were taking a break from
[0:15:43] <%stantheman_97> i respect the pettiness

[0:15:59] <%JamesCorck> Roses are red, Violets are blue, poetry sucks K THX BYE

[0:16:13] <@Spydurman> in conclusion: poetry is a land of complex
[0:16:15] <%dankjerri> YOURE WRONG BUT OK
[0:16:18] <RedSqurrl> Dead Poets Society is an amazing film
[0:16:20] <%AkronymCLT> Poetry isn't inherently bad but I feel like the fact that it's niche means it attracts pretentious people
[0:16:31] <%Broand> playdoughs republic
[0:16:38] <%chill_o_wisp> LOL IT'S THE TOTAL OPPOSITE
[0:16:39] <%pokefan9956> so twitter

[0:16:46] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[0:16:51] <%Mattais88> Poetry was basically tv
[0:16:53] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Am I smarter for saying I'm stupid?
[0:16:54] <%JamesCorck> That person must've been good at Yoga, with how good they can shove their head all the way up their ass.
[0:16:54] <%RealThiele> so replace poetry with hip hop
[0:16:54] <wibbwobbler> Poets be like
[0:16:57] <%AmericanSkidd> So old poetry was just twitter
[0:16:58] <vicar_anat> Local ginger poet owns pretentious English teacher

[0:17:00] <%Meekest> It was a bad time
[0:17:02] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt also plays

[0:17:28] <%dankjerri> scrawl it on a wall
[0:17:35] <robosqueeb> ew books!
[0:17:38] <%maenos2> wrestling too
[0:17:38] <%RealThiele> the old greek lesson of dont fuck your mom
[0:17:39] <%Monkeyweed21> @DianaTheAscian plays and songs required stages and instruments tho, poetry was just something anyone could do
[0:17:39] <%Mattais88> Plato Presents: ANT MAn 3
[0:17:39] <cpt_langosta> play-dough can write?
[0:17:40] <%AmericanSkidd> tic toks
[0:17:41] <%JamesCorck> XD
[0:17:42] <+RoByte2> I haven't watched a lot of youtube videos about killing your father and doing your mother
[0:17:45] <tanarath> oh no
[0:17:46] <+Mrbaconator> plato would be an instagram influencer
[0:17:48] <%Afterman_> jesus
[0:17:48] <%tamale_senpai> You were a commons boy when you wrote that banger, you ironically proved them right but shat in their mouth.
[0:17:48] <%SpcOpsBear> oh noes
[0:17:48] <Visorak6> uncomfortably real
[0:17:49] <RedSqurrl> ewwwie
[0:17:49] <%JamesCorck> He would be totally into Epstein's list.
[0:17:50] <robosqueeb> PLATO WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE BROS WITH EPSTEIN
[0:17:50] <%cooldude69xx> Books are outdated too, IMO
[0:17:51] <%Treuan> Cancel plato
[0:17:55] <%Saffry_Ruzin> He'd be today's Kojima
[0:17:56] <%DianaTheAscian> The greeks really liked poop jokes for some reason
[0:17:56] <notsoy> all the ancient Greeks would be such huge fans of Epstein
[0:17:57] <%Tman451> Plato is the Uwe Bol of poets
[0:17:57] <SaltyAzteca> *pulls collar* Yeeeyeeeyeeeee
[0:17:59] <%dankjerri> no he wouldnt, he would be a jordan peterson style debatelord @patstaresat
[0:18:00] <%stantheman_97> a lot of greek philosophers would
[0:18:01] <%JamesCorck> He'd be pals with Harvey Weinstein.
[0:18:02] <%pokefan9956> yeeeeeeeeep
[0:18:04] <%Monkeyweed21> oh no he would
[0:18:06] <jorniev> COMEDIANS ARE THE NEW THING NOW

[0:18:09] <ryderbootz> wait wait wait Diogenes would never fuck a kid
[0:18:10] <%chill_o_wisp> so crates lmao
[0:18:12] <%SpcOpsBear> ARE WE DISCUSSING THE AGOGE
[0:18:16] <%stantheman_97> the past was weird
[0:18:17] <robosqueeb> I think most places did way back when. shits creepy
[0:18:18] <%Meekest> THEY'RE LITERALLY ALWAYS ON PEDESTALS
[0:18:19] <notsoy> the pedo-stall, maybe
[0:18:23] <%dawarw0lf> I feel like fan fiction is like old poetry and plays
[0:18:23] <BoneofMalkav> Then you got Caligula, fucked anything and everything
[0:18:23] <%stantheman_97> LUL
[0:18:25] <%cooldude69xx> Secret pedophiles are everywhere
[0:18:25] <+dd44dostivei> clip
[0:18:27] <%ahomeschooldropout> who was that philosopher that lived in a barrel. I loved that guy
[0:18:29] <DarkVinceX> you could put them on a pedo stall though
[0:18:29] <%dankjerri> plato, socrates, the spartans
[0:18:31] <tanarath> The Spartans were worse, but yeah
[0:18:32] <%greasypete00> too busy jerking off to fuck kids
[0:18:33] <%tamale_senpai> o _ o) . . . .
[0:18:33] <jorniev> UUUUGH
[0:18:34] <%Mattais88> Well when you life expectancy is like 35, gotta get in while you can
[0:18:36] <bob900000> so you
[0:18:37] <Visorak6> A man who insulted Alexander the great and lived
[0:18:38] <shallaska> he might do it if it'd help him prove a point
[0:18:39] <%lumporr> IF I WERE NOT ALEXANDER I WOULD BE DIOGENES
[0:18:39] <%chill_o_wisp> the classical Danny devito
[0:18:40] <%MidnightBurst12> too busy jerking off in his barrel
[0:18:41] <Blank9> diogenes would have whisky dick, making him incapable of fucking
[0:18:49] <%Ynkubus_> Diogenes would rather fap in the market place
[0:18:50] <Necnill> I wonder if people will talk about dril like that in 1000 years
[0:18:51] <%JamesCorck> You won't live to see this, but in 1,000 years people are going to talk about the MCU like how we talk about the Greek Myth, and it's going to suck shit.
[0:18:52] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Was Diogenes the one in the pot YEYEYEYE
[0:18:53] <%ahomeschooldropout> Remember that time he told Alexander the great to fuck off essentially.
[0:18:53] <digaogrunge> Diogenes would fuck a pile of trash on the corner
[0:18:54] <%SuckerPunchSyd> YEAH
[0:18:55] <%YakumoYomi> He got a behavioral disorder named after him, after all
[0:18:55] <%senfood> Alexander the Great is on record as saying "If I were not already Alxander, I would with to be Diogenes."
[0:18:56] <%Saffry_Ruzin> What would Omega DLC be in Poetry form?
[0:18:56] <%bassoontyphoon> It’s weird how the Catholic Church decided to keep THAT from the Greeks and not much else
[0:18:56] <wibbwobbler> Literally nobody in that time holy crap LUL
[0:18:59] <%DianaTheAscian> I assume every historical figure when you go far back enough is just a sex criminal
[0:19:00] <%chill_o_wisp> LUL
[0:19:01] <@Ranryu692> instead, this Bioware game!
[0:19:01] <cpt_langosta> what about big spiders, tho?
[0:19:02] <%Afterman_> @Mattais88 life expectancy was bad back then due to childbirth/young children deaths i thought
[0:19:06] <%demiiluna> Diogenes fucking beat off in the middle of the market and when people asked him "hey could you stop jacking it in the middle of the market" he's like "ah if only I could banish my hunger by rubbing my belly."
[0:19:09] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Didn’t he bite some famous philosopher too?
[0:19:09] <%pokefan9956> is diogenes just rickety cricket
[0:19:11] <+trackles_64> LEVIATHAN

[0:22:56] <+ThomasOfTroy> But ONLY for mages
[0:22:57] <bob900000> does it hold up?
[0:22:57] <+spacepiratezod> Remember when there was a golem who enjoyed killing birds
[0:22:58] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat So apparently the Quarins mask and hood is suppose to be based on the virgin mary. This is to make Tali look both motherly and virginal
[0:22:58] <Sp3ctre48> I don't cause I did the Mage Tower quest first BabyRage
[0:22:59] <tanarath> Blood Magic is great
[0:23:00] <+ThomasOfTroy> Which was sick
[0:23:01] <%SirGO0SE> hey pat hey chat hey zangief hey elmo hey paige
[0:23:03] <+SataruYamate> you can also just be a total evil dick and kill the kid
[0:23:04] <%castlerock42> Or you could just bang the demon.
[0:23:05] <%dankjerri> intronet
[0:23:07] <@Ranryu692> I can only read the word "enchantment" in that one character's voice
[0:23:13] <%sunsetdisc0> everything after dragon age 1 was basically fantasy politics
[0:23:13] <mattynezz> Remember save scumming that deal to still get the happy ending, but also unlock Blood Magic for OP funs
[0:23:14] <%Monkeyweed21> oh man those people get FUCKED if you take that deal
[0:23:20] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Hell yeah! I'm glad to be working from home this week since I finally get to watch Pat streams
[0:23:24] <%dankjerri> @thomasoftroy you.
[0:23:28] <cpt_langosta> your fault you started with 3
[0:23:32] <%YakumoYomi> Welcome, Goose psaUp
[0:23:33] <%bravebravesrobin> did you look into the Korean show Kingdom on Netflix? Cheer500
[0:23:33] <%Treuan> Relateable
[0:23:35] <$Futurecity10> Halo's dead now so it doesnt matter
[0:23:39] <Visorak6> Well no wonder
[0:23:40] <%maenos2> man I watched the gigaboots guys play through it all, and 1 thru 3 ok.  4 and 5 are TERRIBLE
[0:23:41] <BoneofMalkav> Pat bad a video game? Noooo! Never! LUL
[0:23:43] <+ThomasOfTroy> @dankjerri Jerri
[0:23:43] <%SirGO0SE> yeah man thats not easy to do
[0:23:44] <Blank9> halo just isn't that great
[0:23:44] <+FennecZephyr> Then don't play legendary
[0:23:44] <%lumporr> legendary is for real
[0:23:44] <Sp3ctre48> Why would you do that though
[0:23:44] <@Mechz71> why no shit dumbass!
[0:23:45] <%AmericanSkidd> why would you start at legendary?
[0:23:45] <%KetsuoTaberu> well yeah it's legendary
[0:23:46] <$Futurecity10> Legendary? What the fuck
[0:23:47] <AluxStreams> Legendary is the push-your-shit-in difficulty so yeah.
[0:23:48] <%snow_bush> Well no shit
[0:23:48] <Profmcstevie> Why would you go to the HIGHEST DIFFICULTY
[0:23:48] <%tamale_senpai> I hope Pat does another ME Trilogy playthough later but FULL RENAGADE RUN! >:D
[0:23:49] <%lumporr> it's always harder than it used to be
[0:23:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Do you use a controller like a scrub? Kappa
[0:23:51] <%RealThiele> oof
[0:23:51] <%Afterman_> no halo multiplayer day 1 is insane
[0:23:52] <%Ynkubus_> ???
[0:23:52] <%InternetShis> Oh good lord
[0:23:52] <@Mechz71> LEGENFARY IS FUCKING AWFUL
[0:23:52] <mikeriffic> Maybe you should play it on legendary
[0:23:52] <%stantheman_97> then don't play legendary
[0:23:52] <ToneBacas> it's not. you've aged
[0:23:53] <+FennecZephyr> Heroic is the intended difficulty
[0:23:53] <@Ranryu692> It's almost like Halo's Legendary difficulty is difficult
[0:23:54] <DatAsuna> it's a whole other muscle memory
[0:23:54] <%Mattais88> @Afterman_ Literally eyeballed it. Jaundice was a sign of the puss humour, I think.
[0:23:54] <%lumporr> every time
[0:23:55] <%TungstenViper> oh so you're bad
[0:23:55] <@Ranryu692> no it doesn't
[0:23:55] <%snow_bush> No that's HEROIC
[0:23:56] <%stantheman_97> dont
[0:23:57] <Profmcstevie> LEGENDARY IS ALWAYS ROUGH
[0:23:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Well you're an idiot
[0:23:58] <%chiazam> Why Legendary
[0:23:59] <%Ravioli_Ronin> “Why is the hardest difficulty SO HARD”
[0:23:59] <%lumporr> no it says to play heroic
[0:24:00] <mattynezz> Legendary is no fun allowed
[0:24:00] <%JamesCorck> Dude, yeah.
[0:24:01] <DomunDomunDomun> No shit you got you shit wrecked on Legendary.
[0:24:01] <marvel877> Legendary is hard as fuck, Pat.
[0:24:01] <mikeriffic> no it doesnt
[0:24:01] <Sp3ctre48> I don't think it says that LUL
[0:24:02] <%Rikufmix21> hard mode is hard says pat
[0:24:03] <%SirGO0SE> oh heroic is totally doable
[0:24:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> Maybe don't do that?
[0:24:04] <%InternetShis> Play Halo 1 on Normal and go from there
[0:24:04] <%polothegreatest> halo? already preorder, dont care if others dont like it
[0:24:04] <%JamesCorck> Heroic is fine.
[0:24:05] <%dankjerri> legendory bad
[0:24:07] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Ohhhhhh ok
[0:24:09] <%Ynkubus_> Heroic dumbass
[0:24:10] <Parapattern> It don't matter. None of this matters.
[0:24:10] <cpt_langosta> why listen to difficulty descriptions ever?
[0:24:11] <DatAsuna> very different things
[0:24:13] <%JamesCorck> Legendary, right out cold, holyshit.
[0:24:14] <%Afterman_> @Mattais88 im so glad i didnt live back then fuuuck
[0:24:15] <marvel877> okay, yeah, heroic is fine.
[0:24:15] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Yeah don’t fuckin listen to that
[0:24:15] <DatAsuna> heroic is fine, legendary is fucked
[0:24:15] <mattynezz> Oh, then yeah, you're bad LUL
[0:24:18] <Profmcstevie> Play Normal so you can learn how to be good at it
[0:24:18] <mikeriffic> oh okay, then you are just bad
[0:24:18] <%TungstenViper> so you don't like it because you're bad?
[0:24:19] <%lumporr> heroic is a fun challenge with some tough spots
[0:24:20] <%alphonseisbest> ooooooooooooh ok yea fair
[0:24:20] <BoneofMalkav> Legendary is as unbalanced as Quake 1's Nightmare Difficulty LUL
[0:24:22] <%dankjerri> sipsipHonk sipsipHonk
[0:24:23] <%RealThiele> ooooh so baby got beat by baby difficulty
[0:24:23] <%stantheman_97> play normal to get good enough for heroic
[0:24:23] <mesamus> heroic is still tough
[0:24:24] <%DianaTheAscian> Yeah I think your just bad
[0:24:25] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Then play normal
[0:24:25] <%JamesCorck> Maybe taking it a bit too far right out of the gate lol
[0:24:27] <%SirGO0SE> heroic pretty fairly tuned, legendary is fucked
[0:24:27] <%TungstenViper> pareWEIRD
[0:24:32] <%Ravioli_Ronin> If you want to have fun do normie
[0:24:33] <%JamesCorck> It's fine Pat, we still love you lol <3
[0:24:36] <%maenos2> lol
[0:24:38] <spongeofmystery> "Quick"
[0:24:39] <mikeriffic> yeyeye
[0:24:41] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Legendary is like unfair in Crpgs, it's literally not even designed to be fun at that level.
[0:24:42] <AluxStreams> "quick"
[0:24:43] <%KetsuoTaberu> quick
[0:24:44] <%Treuan> It's rad
[0:24:48] <%polothegreatest> legendary= pistol+plasma gun all campaign
[0:24:52] <DatAsuna> I'd say MGR is an example of the same thing, normal mode is clearly "Oh I played MGS but never character action" lol
[0:25:00] <%afronooch> i still havent noahs 7 hour re vid
[0:25:00] <%dankjerri> BUT WHAT ABOUT TOKIMEKI MEMORIAL 2
[0:25:04] <%InternetShis> Play through Halo 1 on Normal and go from there
[0:25:05] <Sp3ctre48> People tell you Mass Effect has to be played on hardcore too but we don't listen to people's difficulty takes Keepo
[0:25:10] <%alphonseisbest> ONE DAY
[0:25:14] <+pmtriox> he streams now mostly
[0:25:14] <%SveriSageAdvice> @polothegreatest unless its Halo 4, then you're just fucked lol

[0:25:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> will he include the full let's play in the video though? WILL HE THOUGH?????
[0:25:19] <%Treuan> It's been months, I hope he's okay
[0:25:19] <+fetrigon> LUL still hasn't done it yet
[0:25:25] <+ZoltanBMagnus> jpandwrson is currently working on that and cyberpunk video at the same time
[0:25:27] <Sp3ctre48> I think he said he was done making videos right?
[0:25:28] <%NopeBadguy> Noah Caldwell-Gervais put out like an 8-hour video going through the entire Resident Evil series like a week ago @PatStaresAt
[0:25:29] <ape_hawk> so whens pat gonna fuck (over) the quarians?
[0:25:30] <%RetroCop87> I could never handle Joseph Anderson, his streams always give me anxiety for some reason
[0:25:31] <DatAsuna> @Sp3ctre48 Yeah, I enjoy the higher difficulties but it's by no means a must
[0:25:33] <+dd44dostivei> pat, you gonna play skyblivion in 4 years?

[0:25:45] <%Mattais88> @Afterman_  yeah, it's important shit, since it got people thinking and all, but it's the eqivilent or trying to make a tv with a sharpened rock, today. TLDR fuck naturopathy
[0:25:48] <%AmuserName> @PatStaresAt Joe even put out a Patreon post trying to discourage people from continuing their patreon subs. He's still working, but he's got 4 kids now
[0:25:50] <%JamesCorck> Their video would be 24 hours long.

[0:30:48] <%DianaTheAscian> Pat hate the good music
[0:30:49] <cpt_langosta> mouse is fine, keyboard sucks
[0:30:50] <ToneBacas> maybe they're saying mouse and keyboard are OP for shooters

[0:30:59] <+Taisuru> Man Gief goin NUTS
[0:31:00] <%CalderGaming> should have stayed in homeschool for the writing/communication courses
[0:31:03] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I wish gyro aiming is a standard for shooters on console.
[0:31:05] <%ahomeschooldropout> saw people complaining on bf4 about people on series X using mouse and keyboard
[0:31:07] <tanarath> mouse + keyboard is best
[0:31:07] <Profmcstevie> The thing about people calling other players cheating cos of their control scheme having assists and vice versa
[0:31:11] <%Meekest> Baby is not happy
[0:31:12] <%Treuan> bork

[0:31:20] <%Dakuu75> RUN GIEF~!!!
[0:31:21] <%afronooch> not every console shooter supports mnk  on console tho, so its a fair complaint for crossplay games
[0:31:22] <%DianaTheAscian> Idk anyone who is gonna fight for the keyboard
[0:31:26] <%RealThiele> B o r k

[0:31:56] <%bassoontyphoon> Send zangief to the shadow realm
[0:32:02] <%dankjerri> look at pats ass divot
[0:32:03] <WebmanJax> I was about to skip ahead because I thought he was going to BRB. Then I realized this was live.
[0:32:04] <%JamesCorck> cheer500 Hey Pat, so, the cracks on Mass Effect 3 were always easy to see, but now that you're playing the game I hope you have a better understanding of them. Like, I hope now you can see why people say this game has some of the best parts and some of the absolute shittiest parts of the trilogy.
[0:32:16] <%JamesCorck> bits badge tier notification Oh this is a thing?
[0:32:20] <%Dr_DangerPhD> some console players will use convertors to force Keyboard and Mouse on games that don't support it, so there's situations where the complaint is understandable
[0:32:27] <@Spydurman> @WebmanJax I do that all the time. Messes with me when I wanna skip ahead
[0:32:28] <%jillyrancher> yeah James Corck
[0:32:30] <+garagon31> Remember when Big Show called out Destiny Titan players for aim assisted skills?
[0:32:33] <BlackStarAura> da baby

Woah 2 years, fuckin sick, got nothing to say other than fuck yakuza 3, i gave up getting the platinum trophy for that because i hate it, good story, shit gameplay, also, found out that the villain is gay for daigo moleman
[0:32:42] <%DianaTheAscian> I play crossplatform shooters on controller and I've never felt like I was under performing
[0:32:44] <BoneofMalkav> I honestly would love to try a big track ball for character movement (Up and Down to move forward and backwards, Left and Right for strafing) along with Mouse for aiming
[0:32:44] <%dankjerri> come vack boy
[0:32:45] <%ahomeschooldropout> siege scrubs on console were complaining on m&kb
[0:32:48] <RedPlasticCup> zangief good boy
[0:33:03] <%PocketBearIllustrator> meanwhile you have Splatoon where gyro aiming is the standard
[0:33:04] <%KetsuoTaberu> makes sense
[0:33:04] <+trackles_64> Xim/Cronus  user are cheater full stop
[0:33:06] <Frade> gieffff

[0:33:31] <%jillyrancher> SPEEDWAGON
[0:33:33] <Dr_Mooose> he becomes powerful
[0:33:35] <%Dr_DangerPhD> best example is that console overwatch versus pc overwatch is balanced different because they expect you to be using controller instead
[0:33:35] <Zeikier> STRONG BOI
[0:33:36] <%jtdobyns> Im one for controller only. I wish every PC game had controller support. Not a big mouse and keyboard person.
[0:33:39] <Profmcstevie> very well
[0:33:39] <marvel877> yes
[0:33:39] <%DianaTheAscian> oh is splatoon Gyro or nothing?

[0:33:51] <+trackles_64> @jillyrancher  thats cause consoles are locked at 60/30 fps
[0:33:52] <%NopeBadguy> HE'S A GENETIC FREAK

[0:33:53] <%AmericanSkidd> he sounds like a gremlin
[0:33:54] <%NopeBadguy> AND HE'S NOT NORMAL
[0:33:54] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Can people do bite strength tests on dogs and stuff?
[0:33:55] <Profmcstevie> garble garble
[0:33:56] <%PocketBearIllustrator> is Zangief OK? I hope he's my upset over something.
[0:33:58] <%dankjerri> one day he will CHANGE your tires
[0:33:58] <%machshop> i was gonna say he sounds like those things from warcraft 3
[0:33:59] <%KetsuoTaberu> kobolds are dog creatures, right?

[0:37:05] <Virokwet> more or less
[0:37:07] <%donell324> @PatStaresAt nah the wilfred brimely and the Diabeasty
[0:37:10] <@Ranryu692> ME3 clearly needed another like, 2 years of development
[0:37:10] <+Kharinite> Seriously hoping Steve Buscemi isn't a jerk
[0:37:12] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Hey Pat, do you prefer the class system with strict skills or more open skill trees like Andromeda
[0:37:14] <%Mattais88> That's me!
[0:37:17] <%alphonseisbest> NEEDED 1 MORE YEAR
[0:37:22] <%Garthunox> like the omega dlc
[0:37:25] <@Ranryu692> I liked DA2
[0:37:27] <DatAsuna> DA2 also has really good stuff in a handful of areas. but also a lot of bad and reused content
[0:37:29] <%Monkeyweed21> this is just Kotor 2 again
[0:37:30] <%Afterman_> @Kharinite he was in boardwalk empire with michael k williams :(
[0:37:34] <cpt_langosta> GHOSTS
[0:37:34] <%RealThiele> DA:I war table and loot drops is a slog
[0:37:38] <DatAsuna> DA2 is like 30% great
[0:37:39] <DomunDomunDomun> Best parts and shittiest parts of the trilogy also applies to the second game of the original phoenix wright trilogy.
[0:37:40] <+DocReapoff> Inquisition felt more like a chore...
[0:37:41] <%dankjerri> inquisition is the only one i played and its bad
[0:37:41] <%sunsetdisc0> i actually really liked da2
[0:37:42] <mikeriffic> 2 wasnt bad, it just had rushed lvl design I think but it had a lot going for it
[0:37:43] <%Garthunox> @Kharinite dude helped out saving people during 9/11, he's a good guy
[0:37:45] <blackjack8182> DA2 is way better than Inquistion!
[0:37:45] <%JamesCorck> psaDogchamp bork
[0:37:48] <%Mattais88> DA2 is really fun, but uses the same 5 levels 100 times
[0:37:51] <Parapattern> Don't try to contain him
[0:37:53] <%BioHunter> da2 way better than inquisition
[0:37:56] <%JoshManVGH> DA2 s biggest suffering is the level design
[0:37:56] <digaogrunge> DA2 got churned out
[0:37:59] <%jillyrancher> I dunno not being able to be an elf is such a huge turn off
[0:38:01] <+ThomasOfTroy> I can't even play DAI, it feels that feels that fucking awful and boring. I don't want a bunch of bullshit singleplayer MMO type content
[0:38:01] <%Puhff> Yeah INquisition isn't amazing but it doesn't shit the bed either
[0:38:01] <TrollKing96> Dragon Age 2 was my first Dragon Age.
[0:38:03] <%chill_o_wisp> lmaooo
[0:38:03] <%InternetShis> Halo 5 needed a whole different writing team
[0:38:04] <%RealThiele> yea every house in DA2 is the same inside LUL
[0:38:06] <%jillyrancher> Fuck humans
[0:38:07] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Inquisition at least had the Bull. that you can ride.

[0:47:05] <%DrTomT18> LUL
[0:47:08] <%RealThiele> it is indeed labor day here in the states
[0:47:23] <%jillyrancher> Let's do geth Dreadnought
[0:47:23] <GustauveVIII> no one cares about omega on the ship
[0:47:24] <cpt_langosta> rub your greasy bald head all over kaiden's nips
[0:47:25] <%AmericanSkidd> I bet they wont give a fuck
[0:47:29] <%Mattais88> Does anyone even care about it?
[0:47:31] <%DrTomT18> they have nothing to say
[0:47:31] <%Saffry_Ruzin> They weren't there
[0:47:33] <%VitoXXI> labor day reminds me of that vinesauce video
[0:47:35] <%Meekest> I don't think Cortez is a bottom
[0:47:35] <%jillyrancher> nobody says anything
[0:47:39] <%sunsetdisc0> none of them have anything to say about omega
[0:47:41] <mattynezz> lol, they didn't pay the VAs for Omega, remember?
[0:47:42] <%AmuserName> @PatStaresAt That's incredibly rude, don't call Cortez that! Kappa
[0:47:43] <%RealThiele> "We left Donnolly on Omega"
[0:47:45] <%kujofire990> whats an omega
[0:47:49] <%Saffry_Ruzin> They only have stuff to day about Leviathan
[0:47:54] <%CalderGaming> SHUT UP ESTEBAN MEZCAL IS GOOD
[0:47:58] <ape_hawk> his husband died, vega
[0:48:01] <@Ranryu692> only brandy
[0:48:02] <blackjack8182> Omega had no story so there is nothing to talk about
[0:48:06] <Blackleafx> Sheperd?
[0:48:08] <%SpcOpsBear> they... say nothing about omega, don't they?
[0:48:12] <mikeriffic> Tequilla killed his parents
[0:48:13] <$haziqtheunique> Just finished the Omega DLC?
[0:48:13] <%chill_o_wisp> THIS IS A RYNCOL ONLY VESSEL
[0:48:13] <Blackleafx> get cronk
[0:48:13] <%AgniBrandt> I've never had Mezcal
[0:48:15] <SaltyAzteca> Tequila Mockingbird
[0:48:18] <%Monkeyweed21> ey
[0:48:21] <Blackleafx> GUN
[0:48:25] <%tamale_senpai> Reason no Normandy squad allowed on Omega was cuz EA didn't want to pay the voice actors to record dialog for the mission
[0:48:26] <%Saffry_Ruzin> They only talk about Leviathan
[0:48:31] <%AgniBrandt> But I imagine bad mezcal is at least as bad as bad tequila, and that shit's terrible
[0:48:35] <Blackleafx> @AgniBrandt Its a smokier type of Tequila, personally quite fond of it
[0:48:35] <%CalderGaming> @AgniBrandt think tequila but smokier, usually
[0:48:35] <%RealThiele> Alghul please
[0:48:38] <%Broand> isn't tequila made from an endangered cactus
[0:48:38] <digaogrunge> Shepard likes those alien cocktails
[0:48:41] <Minorou> Did you check out the new powers in the medbay you unlocked after beating that DLC?
[0:48:45] <%donell324> @PatStaresAt just wanted to let everyone know that my hit and run case is soon closing out and when that is done I will get the payout from the Uber car insurance yay me also I'm doing better

[0:49:52] <%alphonseisbest> FLARE.
[0:49:52] <%JamesCorck> Make a poll Pat.
[0:49:52] <mattynezz> Reave is better, Flare is cooler
[0:49:53] <Sp3ctre48> Reave is better tbh
[0:49:55] <%alphonseisbest> GO FLARE#
[0:49:55] <%RealThiele> Flare sounds more magicy
[0:49:56] <%Garthunox> @Wurmspawn that joke doesnt work cos its not EDIs body yet
[0:49:56] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Lash can Ragdoll Kai Leng Pat
[0:49:57] <DatAsuna> Your squad can reave
[0:49:58] <%chill_o_wisp> heh
[0:49:58] <cpt_langosta> BIG SPIDER
[0:49:58] <digaogrunge> Flare has huge cooldown
[0:50:00] <%alphonseisbest> FLARE ALL THE WAY
[0:50:01] <%JamesCorck> I vote Reave but I say do a Poll.
[0:50:02] <%alphonseisbest> FLARE
[0:50:02] <blackjack8182> Flare
[0:50:02] <@Ranryu692> you can change later I'm pretty sure
[0:50:05] <%xcompleasedad> Why don't you????
[0:50:05] <%alphonseisbest> FLAVE IS BETTER
[0:50:05] <Sp3ctre48> Well NEVER MIND then
[0:50:06] <AluxStreams> Flare gives you a ranged attack for your biotic arsenal.
[0:50:08] <%xcompleasedad> Ah
[0:50:08] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Flare for range
[0:50:10] <PaperyHornet1013> flare takes too long to cooldown
[0:50:13] <%alphonseisbest> FLARE IS WAAAY BETTER
[0:50:14] <DatAsuna> You can just get flare now and respec later
[0:50:17] <%Dopamien> Who?
[0:50:18] <studleydoorite> Reaveon was the best eevee evolution
[0:50:19] <%RealThiele> become Black Mage
[0:50:20] <tattleworm> you can get something else in the meantime and swap it out
[0:50:23] <mattynezz> Barrier is actually the "best" though
[0:50:25] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Lash makes Kai Leng flop around like an idiot
[0:50:27] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Oh hey Pat check out the Secondary Codex Reaper War entry for Cerberus Coup. it elaborates a bit on Udina's motivation.
[0:50:40] <DatAsuna> there's no good reason to have no bonus power for so long
[0:50:40] <%MrWurmles> @Wurmspawn It does because the adnriod was still a woman, and I didn't care enough to look up the original name and getting hung up on details always kills a joke.
[0:50:46] <blackjack8182> Lash is just better pull
[0:50:52] <digaogrunge> Basically a Fireball
[0:50:54] <%peyodogo> what's the power that pat keeps using to take down his own shields after charging, dooming himself
[0:50:56] <%peyodogo> should prob not get that one
[0:51:01] <%RealThiele> Blizzard stream
[0:51:06] <jorniev> DICK EM DOWN
[0:51:08] <tattleworm> basically the exact same as before but put all your cryo points into bonus power instead
[0:51:09] <%InternetShis> But does Lash prime biotic combos?
[0:51:10] <Parapattern> Assault that Qussy
[0:51:11] <lord_sykos> Isn't your rep already maxed?
[0:51:11] <mattynezz> @PatStaresAt Youre rep is maxed, you don't need the boost
[0:51:13] <%ahomeschooldropout> The explanation for why Cerberus has more than 150 operatives is so stupid it would've been better if they didn't.
[0:51:14] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Yeah, but it also make Kai bitch Leng ragdoll
[0:51:31] <%SpcOpsBear> @peyodogo that's part of his class powers though, and he can instantly recharge his shields using biotic charge anyway
[0:51:37] <%alphonseisbest> @peyodogo THATS Part of the Vangard kit in three, its very, Pat just bad at using it
[0:51:45] <GustauveVIII> according to wiki, if you didnt talk to kaiden on the ship immediately after you get him, you cant get reave ever again
[0:51:46] <Profmcstevie> Heavy Melee is off the menu
[0:51:47] <%InternetShis> Fitness dick in that Qussy gottem
[0:51:48] <%tamale_senpai> You should use shockwave more to detonate fire explosions on enemies hit with incendiary rounds. Super OP in main game
[0:51:50] <mrblack499> if you want to learn how to do that just get a job with blizzard
[0:51:58] <%Mattais88> Nova
[0:52:00] <%peyodogo> dont worry about it
[0:52:02] <%peyodogo> : )
[0:52:08] <%xcompleasedad> @ahomeschooldropout It should've been Mechs with the AI that piloted the Eva body from Mars running them all
[0:52:11] <mattynezz> Nova
[0:52:11] <%AmuserName> @PatStaresAt Double Nova is cool, more I-Frames
[0:52:11] <cpt_langosta> These upgrade trees are alright, but they are no Microsoft Bob, I tell you what...
[0:52:12] <%alphonseisbest> nothing
[0:52:14] <DatAsuna> I would say shockwave and pull at 6 are basically interchangable, so it's viable to minmax one at the exclusion of the other
[0:52:14] <%alphonseisbest> :)
[0:52:18] <%Daxalog> Is he respeccing?
[0:52:19] <%RealThiele> ABCs of biotics
[0:52:21] <%alphonseisbest> Keeping playing
[0:52:24] <%InternetShis> :)
[0:52:28] <%peachy996> What is the mission for today?
[0:52:31] <mattynezz> It's fine, you're very good at the video game :)
[0:52:32] <Oqzar> AoE charge is amazing
[0:52:34] <%alphonseisbest> ur getting better tho Pat
[0:52:37] <GustauveVIII> double nova allows you to have some leeway in survival tho
[0:52:39] <mattynezz> Not bad at all :)
[0:52:40] <%alphonseisbest> if that makes u feel batter
[0:52:40] <Sp3ctre48> Nova nukes your own shields and it makes chat mad apparently
[0:52:40] <%peyodogo> :)
[0:52:41] <Dunmarkh> they were talking about nova
[0:52:43] <+cermo55> every time you reset powers price goes up
[0:52:43] <%alphonseisbest> better
[0:52:48] <%tamale_senpai> DO YOU EVEN KNOW ABOUT FIRE EXPLOSIONS? :O They fuck shit up!
[0:52:49] <+TheBobulus> If I remember right, double-nova means that only half your shield goes down when you nova. Helps with survivability
[0:52:51] <%jillyrancher> Tbh I rarely used Nova for my insanity run
[0:52:56] <jorniev> does pat know hot to do an infinite?
[0:52:59] <$Mekhet09> Why respect?
[0:52:59] <DatAsuna> yeah half cost matters more than double cast, really
[0:53:01] <+GuilKato> luckily pat has infinite monies
[0:53:02] <$lotharrio> @cermo55 It's okay. Pat pees money.
[0:53:02] <%cooldude69xx> Oh no! Money!
[0:53:03] <Minorou> oh no, money. Anyway...
[0:53:05] <Profmcstevie> Not hurtin
[0:53:05] <%SpcOpsBear> when would pat ever be worried about prices in a single player game
[0:53:11] <%AmericanSkidd> oh no another 500 credits, the war is lost
[0:53:13] <DatAsuna> money is no object
[0:53:15] <mattynezz> Explosion
[0:53:16] <Sp3ctre48> Really concerning about his infinite money running out
[0:53:17] <%alphonseisbest> @Sp3ctre48 nah, we just joshing Pat, over him using it with then charging to get back his shields LUL
[0:53:19] <%Rumbutt> oh no, where will we find the credits?! (in the bathroom, Pat has credits in the bathroom)
[0:53:22] <%RealThiele> with a small loan from anderson of one million credits
[0:53:24] <mattynezz> Explosion triggers off every pellet
[0:53:29] <tattleworm> they're dying too fast because of the explosion lol
[0:53:29] <DatAsuna> even on insanity the explosion sucks compared to damage
[0:53:30] <%jillyrancher> Pat cheated tons of money
[0:53:35] <%peachy996> Sadly explosive ammo in this is a bust. Not like it was in ME1
[0:53:36] <mattynezz> But.. explosion IS more damage
[0:53:36] <%jillyrancher> TehePelo
[0:53:38] <%DracosMagala> Then up the diff kolGlasses
[0:53:44] <%Treuan> Grinded off camera
[0:53:46] <%peyodogo> just found a big wallet
[0:53:48] <Alzero83> Liar!
[0:53:49] <%Rumbutt> I found lots of money in his toilet
[0:53:50] <Aiutare47> pat pissed on his console
[0:53:51] <Minorou> spectre funds
[0:53:51] <Necnill> Space crypto
[0:53:52] <DatAsuna> he inherited it
[0:53:53] <Profmcstevie> He fell into his dead uncles funds
[0:53:54] <+GuilKato> @jillyrancher pat went to the mens room and money just appeared
[0:53:54] <mikeriffic> Where did the money come from pat?
[0:53:55] <%AmericanSkidd> he had a secret volus bank account'
[0:53:56] <AluxStreams> Pat invested in Shepcoin.
[0:53:56] <+GuilKato> in teh mends room
[0:53:57] <digaogrunge> HE PISSED THE MONEY
[0:53:57] <%hairtoday> he EARNED that money, with a cheat engine!
[0:53:57] <%sniffy77> Pat had Shepardcoin
[0:53:58] <%Mattais88> Just found it lying in the middle of the citadel
[0:53:58] <cpt_langosta> it's not mine, i swear!
[0:53:59] <%RetroCop87> found it in the hexadecimal
[0:54:00] <%Monkeyweed21> SHEPCOIN
[0:54:01] <%KetsuoTaberu> Pat is dooming the galaxy to hyperinflation
[0:54:02] <+Gamblor69> "Its just resting in my account"
[0:54:02] <Visorak6> INVESTED INTO SHEPCOIN
[0:54:02] <tattleworm> explosive ammo is busted on shotguns because it procs per shotgun pellet so you're practically guaranteed a boom
[0:54:03] <%MrWurmles> Yeah, Pat just went to the bathroom and then when he got back, it was just there!
[0:54:04] <Sp3ctre48> In the space debris
[0:54:08] <%Saffry_Ruzin> He robbed Anderson's Apartment
[0:54:09] <%spitelite> he cheated a shit tone of money
[0:54:10] <$lotharrio> He just takes golden showers.
[0:54:10] <%CapnBeefs> toilet money
[0:54:10] <mrblack499> it dose not matter if you did
[0:54:10] <%Pukenasty> it fell off a space truck
[0:54:12] <%InternetShis> He invested in Talicoin
[0:54:13] <Visorak6> @Monkeyweed21 ahahaha
[0:54:14] <$Mekhet09> I don't even know how the ammo works I went full biotic. My character could only be psychic.
[0:54:14] <%JamesCorck> Jeeze.
[0:54:15] <haisho> I thought it was from all that Citadel sponsorship
[0:54:17] <%tamale_senpai> Multiplayer game-play is much more challenging from what I remember.
[0:54:21] <jorniev> SHEPARD must be the most dangerous man in the glaxy if he can fist fight GIANT robots
[0:54:23] <+garagon31> The Alliance funds all it's government operations with toilet money
[0:54:23] <DatAsuna> 30% of 16s is significant
[0:54:24] <%peachy996> less time
[0:54:25] <%Mattais88> Go heavy, fuck everything up one time
[0:54:26] <+DocReapoff> 16 reduced by 200% tho
[0:54:27] <%InternetShis> He did Armax Arsenal Arena early
[0:54:28] <tattleworm> this is an awful skill for vanguards
[0:54:29] <blackjack8182> Shepherd embezzled war funding
[0:54:33] <@Ranryu692> I feel like Vanguard wants the cooldown time
[0:54:34] <%jillyrancher> the explosive applies to each bullet in the shotgun spread so it's pretty nice on a shotgun like Scimitar with lots of bullets
[0:54:35] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Pat needs to cheat to get reave; wiki says if you didn't talk to kaiden immediately after you get him, you miss out on it forever
[0:54:37] <%JamesCorck> I mean Flare's pretty baller too.
[0:54:38] <mattynezz> Recharge, 100%
[0:54:39] <+critikal_bit> Pat Shepard committed tax evasion, but the Reapers killed the Space IRS, that's why
[0:54:42] <%JamesCorck> Both powers are good.
[0:54:42] <Sp3ctre48> People like Flare for the meme but it's not something I'd like using on vanguard
[0:54:43] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> What kinda armor are you using Pat?
[0:54:47] <%xcompleasedad> You can now kill all Barriers
[0:54:49] <DatAsuna> Now shields will bother him no more
[0:54:49] <$lotharrio> You don't even do combos, pat. Go recharge
[0:54:49] <cpt_langosta> why even bother with shockwave?
[0:54:51] <mrblack499> he got by selling feet pics?
[0:54:52] <%cooldude69xx> @tamale_senpai A lot more enemies spawned and you only got three powers
[0:54:53] <%tamale_senpai> We gotta teach Pat to chain explosions
[0:54:53] <%JamesCorck> Reave suits my gameplay style better.
[0:54:54] <+SataruYamate> does vanguard even have the agency to use flare?
[0:54:55] <DatAsuna> Which is good cause rannoch is shield land
[0:54:57] <digaogrunge> And abilities all share the same cooldown, so no dashing for like 8 seconds
[0:54:59] <%alphonseisbest> at 200% speed U won't notice it/ ITS for far away enemys
[0:55:01] <%InternetShis> Barriers Must Die
[0:55:02] <cpt_langosta> keep them
[0:55:05] <DatAsuna> Shockwave is better pull
[0:55:07] <%peachy996> Not in Cryo Ammo, that's for sure
[0:55:09] <DatAsuna> Once maxed
[0:55:10] <%Broand> is biotics the equivelent of spellcasting?
[0:55:13] <mattynezz> Cryo Ammo for Squad
[0:55:14] <PanicSwytch> bruh
[0:55:15] <Ardailec> Could've held them as a show of dominance.
[0:55:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea bruh
[0:55:18] <Sp3ctre48> ME
[0:55:20] <+cermo55> Does Pat know about the ragdoll Kia Leng tactic?
[0:55:20] <%alphonseisbest> @SataruYamate no, but it makes it even MORE DBZ
[0:55:25] <%SpcOpsBear> @Broand basically
[0:55:27] <$lotharrio> @Broand Largely, sorta.
[0:55:28] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Yeah Biotics\ are space magic
[0:55:28] <Profmcstevie> m-me
[0:55:28] <%tamale_senpai> They mention nothing about Omega cuz... well...
[0:55:28] <%DrTomT18> Shockwave pull
[0:55:30] <ape_hawk> omega never happened
[0:55:31] <%jillyrancher> I mostly used Shockwave as detonating machine
[0:55:35] <%sniffy77> Thats cause EA would have to pay the voice actors for new dialogue
[0:55:37] <BurdRightsActivist> Calibrations
[0:55:38] <%jillyrancher> Nooooope
[0:55:40] <+TheBobulus> If they didn't pay the voice actors for omega, they aren't going to pay them to react to omega, I guess?
[0:55:48] <mattynezz> Shockwave works alright against Husks
[0:55:49] <+GuilKato> do you have all the side quest items collected?
[0:55:50] <%peyodogo> what is an omega
[0:55:50] <jorniev> what was the inifinite sequence?
[0:55:51] <%peachy996> Go to Purgatory please
[0:55:52] <+Soliloquy123> @PatStaresAt I don't think they bothered hiring on any squad voice actors for Omega
[0:55:56] <%InternetShis> Cause EA are cheapskate bastards
[0:55:57] <%jillyrancher> Omega was so lame
[0:56:07] <cpt_langosta> honestly, it barely matters
[0:56:07] <%AmericanSkidd> for now probably
[0:56:17] <%Saffry_Ruzin> The Map tells you most of the time
[0:56:18] <%MrWurmles> I can garuntee you, that you don't. Not all the side quests are doable when you get them.
[0:56:20] <BurdRightsActivist> @peachy996 No, don't listen tot his person. Don't like die and go to purgatory that'd be bad, pat
[0:56:21] <%Monkeyweed21> I missed the last ME stream did anything important happen?
[0:56:23] <%VitoXXI> this game looks like space borderlands with a visual novel mixed in
[0:56:28] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Also Pat would you use extra Armor sets provided by Mods? Some are from MP classes and are pretty sweet
[0:56:32] <Oqzar> didnt you do this before omega?
[0:56:40] <studleydoorite> Shepard never told them about Omega, they just think he was on a bender and don't want to talk about it
[0:56:41] <%DrTomT18> pat you can check if you have the quest item for a character by looking your map on the citidel
[0:56:42] <digaogrunge> check the spectre station if you missed any
[0:56:43] <mattynezz> Some of the Blue areas DO have stuff to find
[0:56:49] <%peachy996> @BurdRightsActivist Don't believe this person. Someone very special is sitting on the couch
[0:56:57] <%AmericanSkidd> not always
[0:56:57] <dekkitout> @VitoXXI Isn't Borderlands inherently in space?
[0:57:01] <%sporeian94> see how solider is listed, it means you have the item
[0:57:03] <AluxStreams> The character becomes named on the map if you have it.
[0:57:06] <%Mattais88> QWheter their name show up
[0:57:07] <%MugenSandan> In your MIND
[0:57:11] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Says their name up there
[0:57:16] <%Monkeyweed21> they wll be named on the map
[0:57:16] <stormhawk9891> If it show's their name
[0:57:17] <%Jeemukun> see how you have those random characters listed on the map?
[0:57:17] <mattynezz> I don't think it will list them if you don't have it
[0:57:17] <Sp3ctre48> That is really weird
[0:57:18] <%tamale_senpai> @PatStaresAt Hit up the shooting range and test out some assault rifles, there is a reason ME2 Vanguard was not allowed to have them till later in the game. Assault rifle Vanguard is OP AF!
[0:57:18] <PaperyHornet1013> if you have it a character will show up
[0:57:21] <%ProfBrownsugar> points of interest
[0:57:21] <%jillyrancher> Soldier
[0:57:22] <%VitoXXI> but most of it is on pandora
[0:57:22] <%DrTomT18> see random names? like Soldier
[0:57:26] <cpt_langosta> his NAME is soldier? way to name your kid, jackass parents...
[0:57:27] <%jillyrancher> Console
[0:57:28] <%Jeemukun> like "soldier" or "doctor"?
[0:57:29] <LightningLynx89> If their name is up there it shows you have stuff for them
[0:57:29] <%VitoXXI> 1 and 2 anyways
[0:57:30] <%jillyrancher> doctor
[0:57:34] <kikoeru_san> no fucking way, just give it to a random dude
[0:57:42] <%logoth_> Now he's going to dai-fu
[0:57:45] <Virokwet> names for a random chara in blue are usually quest related
[0:57:48] <Sp3ctre48> I'm sure they'll be fine
[0:57:48] <dekkitout> Pat, that guy died 8 years ago Kappa
[0:57:51] <digaogrunge> HES DEAD
[0:57:55] <%jillyrancher> Like its shit but it's not as shit as it could be

[0:58:12] <cpt_langosta> i... think they included both takes of the actor saying "cerberus" there
[0:58:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Why does the Sergeant have 1 private
[0:58:15] <HyperionXV> He did
[0:58:18] <PaperyHornet1013> save it

[1:04:06] <LightningLynx89> Yes
[1:04:08] <%snow_bush> I'm Commander Shepard and Manscaping is my favorite method of shaving my balls
[1:04:08] <haisho> You need the sponsorship money
[1:04:10] <Dunmarkh> @deft_thought so is shepherd
[1:04:11] <%peachy996> My anguish at not getting to romance garrus as a dude
[1:04:11] <Profmcstevie> Honeymoons don't pay themselves Garrus
[1:04:12] <Dova573> letting him win smh
[1:04:14] <viewtifulr> you can make his balss small another way
[1:04:14] <Dova573> shm

[1:04:16] <GustauveVIII> too bad it didnt translate into andromeda
[1:04:17] <%Mattais88> And Jacob and ashley
[1:04:19] <DatAsuna> If bioware is good at anything, it's romances
[1:04:19] <%Puhff> ew
[1:04:20] <%SpcOpsBear> @ape_hawk given they're based on avian physiology... they probably don't dangle
[1:04:20] <%peachy996> Well they used to
[1:04:21] <Brandon__Brando> ya it hurts
[1:04:22] <Parapattern> You mean the REASON to won this game?
[1:04:23] <$hattrick61> There's a cut scene where the cops show up and you run away
[1:04:23] <Alzero83> I love the Original ME Trilogy more than Star Wars
[1:04:26] <+GuilKato> they wrote the Reverse of Bioware office people?
[1:04:27] <%cooldude69xx> And they aren't all quips. Only mostly quips
[1:04:27] <%NocturneNovember> let Ishikawa write a Mass Effect
[1:04:28] <medoodoo> SHAVE LIKE SHEPARD - MANSCAPED!
[1:04:28] <%sporeian94> that's the true bioware magic
[1:04:28] <Sp3ctre48> Everyone makes fun of Shepard for selling out and dancing bad NotLikeThis
[1:04:28] <%BioHunter> except the human squadmates
[1:04:30] <+c4llmesnuggles> would shephard do a RAID sponsor though?

[1:04:43] <@Ranryu692> he told you he always wanted to see it
[1:04:45] <%peachy996> Should have saved and done both options
[1:04:45] <%ArchimerCXV> The Normandy swoops  onto earth with a big Dollar Shave Club promo on the side
[1:04:46] <%alphonseisbest> @ape_hawk would it be barbed?

[1:06:36] <%peachy996> You can have Javik bum them all out, it's great
[1:06:37] <+Goraka91> LUL
[1:06:38] <Sp3ctre48> @Sp3ctre48 It's explained that the Reapers can't turn the Relay network off through the Citadel anymore, but it's still the seat of galactic power in this cycle
[1:06:39] <%unstablebeast19> would this be like a Christian meeting Jesus, and he was like, a hard-core slave owner?
[1:06:42] <Brandon__Brando> oh no
[1:06:44] <+trackles_64> Geez Javik your brutal realism

[1:07:17] <TioXyco> become what you must. become... the star destroyer
[1:07:17] <%cooldude69xx> @Sp3ctre48 And they're making their way to it, but they still want to harvest everything on the way
[1:07:17] <$hattrick61> tone down the honesty just a bit
[1:07:20] <quipquest1> WE ARE NOT DROIDS
[1:07:22] <%Deft_Thought> What an uncharacteristic speech to hear from Javik
[1:07:27] <%demiiluna> "PIVOT. PIVOT."
[1:07:27] <+GuilKato> luckily that was being recorded I assume
[1:07:29] <%Ghufufin> javik the war recruiter
[1:07:29] <studleydoorite> go machines go MrDestructoid
[1:07:32] <Profmcstevie> Don't spread it around that there's a Prothean here
[1:07:35] <%Puhff> You dont know that
[1:07:35] <SaltyAzteca> HE'S OLD
[1:07:38] <%Mattais88> Javik will have a SpaceTikTok by the afternoon
[1:07:38] <+trackles_64> How old is Javik?
[1:07:38] <+garagon31> Prothean promos really take you on a ride
[1:07:38] <spuginky> oh shit
[1:07:42] <%tamale_senpai> Pat try out the new guns you got! SHOOTING RANGE! SHOOTING RANGE! SHOOTING RANGE! SHOOTING RANGE! SHOOTING RANGE!
[1:07:42] <+Soliloquy123> "Uh, I sort boxes at Amazon but thanks for that."
[1:07:43] <%peachy996> Should have bummed them out
[1:07:43] <RaidenRising> big boomer
[1:07:44] <+ALazo> walking among the... loincloths
[1:07:45] <ThatGuyThere03> naw
[1:07:45] <%Puhff> All Turians are soldiers
[1:07:46] <Alzero83> yes
[1:07:47] <+Goraka91> Yeah but he's DLC who cares
[1:07:47] <TheMostAverageGamer4> the yshould
[1:07:48] <%Dakuu75> n ope
[1:07:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> nah
[1:07:49] <%ZephynM> Dude sounds like Seer from Apex whom I hear is the guy who voiced Hermes in Futurama.
[1:07:50] <+GuilKato> you'd think people would freak out and think he a was a collector
[1:07:52] <%InternetShis> That's a threat
[1:07:53] <+TheBobulus> I assume most of them don't know what a prothean looks like
[1:07:53] <jorniev> APARENTLY they are
[1:07:53] <Badgerconda_> it'd be like a neanderthal showing up in new york city
[1:07:54] <Profmcstevie> shhh, keep it on the down low
[1:07:54] <+FelIian> THEY SHOULD
[1:07:54] <%AmericanSkidd> yeah, that should be a bigger deal
[1:07:55] <%JoshManVGH> The Hanar specifically
[1:07:56] <+GuilKato> makes more sense than a prothean
[1:07:57] <snivins> DLC LUL
[1:07:58] <cpt_langosta> a velociraptor walked into the capitol
[1:07:59] <%cooldude69xx> @trackles_64 12
[1:08:00] <+trackles_64> ok boomer javok
[1:08:02] <TioXyco> nah, he's just another alien
[1:08:02] <lord_sykos> They didn't freak out at Legion in 2
[1:08:02] <%AmuserName> Yeah, but SHUT UP THOUGH
[1:08:03] <SaltyAzteca> nah, the reapers be attackin so anything goes
[1:08:03] <%Rumbutt> giant space cuttlefish are harvesting the galaxy so.... no
[1:08:03] <Brandon__Brando> ya that would be galaxy wide news
[1:08:04] <hassanico2> Javik rules
[1:08:05] <$lotharrio> They can sense he's DLC
[1:08:06] <Vadrigar1994> It would be like meeting a fucking dinosaur
[1:08:06] <Virokwet> why would anyone believe him
[1:08:06] <Profmcstevie> It's like a fucking space caveman
[1:08:08] <%peachy996> If you take him to Surkesh the Salarians think it's just crazy plastic surgery
[1:08:11] <%bravebravesrobin> how are the Hanar not flipping their shit
[1:08:11] <Blank9> reapers are happening now
[1:08:11] <%Saffry_Ruzin> It's the end of the world, what does it matter?
[1:08:12] <quipquest1> That's like if a dinosaur just walked up to you
[1:08:13] <%Deft_Thought> I dunno. The apocalypse is banging on their door.
[1:08:13] <%stantheman_97> a lot of wack ass crazy shit is happening in like a couple months
[1:08:15] <%InternetShis> Day 1 DLC Aura
[1:08:16] <+trackles_64> You fucking would
[1:08:17] <jorniev> I WOULD
[1:08:18] <teg88> They're probably more worried about the giant space genocide robots
[1:08:18] <+Exicuren> After the reapers attacking, you just accept things
[1:08:19] <hassanico2> Do people even KNOW what a Prothean looks like?
[1:08:20] <%JoshManVGH> Litterally met their deific beings
[1:08:20] <dekkitout> I would, those things were small
[1:08:24] <studleydoorite> "that's a mean looking chicken"
[1:08:25] <%Mattais88> And then try to pet/ride it
[1:08:27] <RLT917> super boomer Javik techsOLD
[1:08:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt a lot of people assume he's a Batarian thats genemodded to shit
[1:08:30] <ape_hawk> youd go "oh fuck, they DO have feathers!"
[1:08:31] <%AmericanSkidd> just another day on the citadel I guess
[1:08:32] <Archer336> Even if the velociraptor was telling us how cool we were at surviving?
[1:08:32] <kikoeru_san> Hi Doc
[1:08:33] <%ZephynM> This guy sounds like he's from Skyrim.
[1:08:35] <%Ynkubus_> Like holy shit a prothean, and wow  an old alien, and I want it in its hole etc
[1:08:36] <%hrbeck_> a velociraptor that was also Jesus Christ
[1:08:36] <hassanico2> BTW, why is Bailey a recurring character? Isn't he a corrupt piece of shit?
[1:08:37] <BurdRightsActivist> KappaPride
[1:08:38] <MirTeiwaz_TV> If only Javik had been part of the main game instead of day one DLC
[1:08:38] <RaidenRising> but you can visit the atlus building in japan pat
[1:08:39] <%bread_assassin> @PatStaresAt Ok, but what if there was also a galactic apocalypse going on?
[1:08:44] <%xcompleasedad> The Hanar would be rioting to touch Javik
[1:08:44] <%Puhff> well tbf there's a lot of crazy shit going on right now
[1:08:47] <vonmaultke> I just realised his accent, Space South African
[1:08:49] <Alzero83> Batarian Filth
[1:08:50] <%cooldude69xx> Other parts of the game imply that people walk around impersonating protheans, so folks might just think he's doing that
[1:08:53] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> When 2 mile machines are killing planets then you lose your sense of wonder
[1:08:53] <%tamale_senpai> Try some GUUUUUNS!
[1:08:58] <%Mattais88> Miranda
[1:09:01] <%ZephynM> That guy at the desk sounded like General Tulius from Skyrim

[1:09:27] <Sp3ctre48> @Sp3ctre48 They could harvest everything far easier if the current cycle wasn't able to coordinate themselves on the Citadel, it was explicitly said in ME1 that there was a purpose to attacking it than just turning off the relays

[1:10:18] <%Puhff> oh hi miranda
[1:10:21] <tanarath> You didn't think he was beaten, did you? That was just a TEST! The next fight will test his TRUE power.
[1:10:22] <%peachy996> The strangest thing about Miranda is there's a promo picture of the Citadel DLC suggesting she comes along. She does not
[1:10:24] <%JamesCorck> Kai "I Use A Sword It's cool guys stop laughing" Leng.
[1:10:24] <%Dakuu75> yep

[1:11:11] <beard__0> Kai “daddy’s money” leng
[1:11:11] <%NateyBeak> I just got here what other bad jokes did I miss
[1:11:13] <%Puhff> im not mad, im just disappointed
[1:11:16] <Sp3ctre48> @Sp3ctre48 I don't think so, it's relevant enough of a detail that the only answer probably shouldnt be "the game still needs a hub area"
[1:11:19] <dekkitout> Are you the volus?
[1:11:25] <cpt_langosta> embassy guard
[1:11:27] <hassanico2> BTW chat is pat using any mods?
[1:11:27] <%Mattais88> end of the hallway i think
[1:11:29] <blackjack8182> Din Korlack!
[1:11:34] <hassanico2> The game looks noticeably sharper than expected
[1:11:37] <%cooldude69xx> @tamale_senpai It sure would be TERRIBLE if we got to see the new guns Pat got!
[1:11:48] <%Saffry_Ruzin> He's by the spot where you killed that Hanar
[1:11:48] <@Spydurman> except the money mod LUL
[1:11:49] <hassanico2> Your setup must be great
[1:11:50] <+GuilKato> end of the hallway guy wanted crypto
[1:11:55] <%peyodogo> @hassanico2 i mean it is the legendary edition
[1:11:59] <jorniev> there should be a mod for BIG EYEBALLS
[1:12:02] <%chill_o_wisp> all volus is the same
[1:12:03] <blackjack8182> Map
[1:12:05] <%NopeBadguy> How can you even tell who's the right volus since they're all suits anyway
[1:12:06] <Blackleafx> You'd think the Volus would personalize their suits a bit more
[1:12:10] <%Puhff> no mods; just cheats :)
[1:12:12] <hassanico2> @peyodogo I saw someone else stream it and it looked uglier, I dunno why
[1:12:13] <+fetrigon> QUEEEEEEEEN KomodoHype
[1:12:17] <%demiiluna> It's not racist to say all volus look the same, right? Because it's their suits.
[1:12:17] <BurdRightsActivist> STRAWBERRY PogChamp
[1:12:18] <%kujofire990> its blue tits
[1:12:21] <Sp3ctre48> Not killing my daughters Shepard Keepo
[1:12:22] <%peachy996> She has the best eyes out of all Asari
[1:12:22] <$lotharrio> Big suicide charge
[1:12:22] <%jillyrancher> momma
[1:12:23] <cpt_langosta> will she finally reveal why she wears a strawberry into battle?
[1:12:25] <AthenaAegis> Nope, no mods.....except for that money that fell off the back of a toilet Kappa
[1:12:25] <+fetrigon> wait no
[1:12:32] <%peachy996> They're so glassy and blue lookin
[1:12:33] <%cooldude69xx> @Sp3ctre48 Eh. The reapers are doing enough, if they were here there wouldnt be much to do because the game would be over
[1:12:38] <+GuilKato> Strawberry is best non-wifu girl
[1:12:40] <%peyodogo> @hassanico2 oh yeah probably his Huge setup then
[1:12:42] <%Mattais88> Mommie Eilish
[1:12:44] <+fetrigon> wtf
[1:12:45] <%Monkeyweed21> thank you for not killing my daughter for stupid reasons
[1:12:48] <%Shikari21> Samara is so hot
[1:12:50] <+ALazo> make sure the number is big
[1:12:54] <blackjack8182> No mods? Sure pat
[1:12:58] <dekkitout> Well memorialize her with the hugest statue... with the hugest knockers
[1:13:02] <%bassoontyphoon> So if Kai Leng is a CERBERUS operative who is “the best at everything” why was he not considered for the suicide mission????
[1:13:04] <mrblack499> dat ass
[1:13:05] <%demiiluna> "Nah I'll just make sure the number is big."
[1:13:13] <%watts121> Working on Labor Day? How American of you coxRee
[1:13:21] <Vadrigar1994> "My name is Dick BigHuge and I have the biggest fleet on the citadel"
[1:13:22] <+scrublordsamurai> @patstaresat did you get those batarian bastards onside?
[1:13:25] <Blackleafx> @bassoontyphoon he was in space jail
[1:13:26] <quipquest1> @bassoontyphoon Too important, man.
[1:13:30] <%xcompleasedad> @bassoontyphoon Because he's a fuckhead
[1:13:33] <%cooldude69xx> @bassoontyphoon He was busy. With stuff
[1:13:37] <%Deft_Thought> Why is she pacing
[1:13:38] <+GuilKato> do you think her jacket actually does up or the boobs too big fo it to close?
[1:13:44] <cpt_langosta> FUCK THA CODE
[1:13:50] <jorniev> whats a paladin
[1:13:54] <BurdRightsActivist> @bassoontyphoon He was eating cereal
[1:13:56] <%watts121> WHY WOULD IT?!?!
[1:13:57] <zhenthrim213> except that one time you almost shot your child
[1:13:59] <%castlerock42> That is a very unsatisfying answer to the question.
[1:14:03] <%AmericanSkidd> kill them all shepard
[1:14:04] <%InternetShis> @bassoontyphoon Because cereal
[1:14:07] <%Shikari21> @GuilKato boobs too big
[1:14:12] <%jillyrancher> Kai "I got beat by a dying man" Leng
[1:14:21] <+scrublordsamurai> rip and tear
[1:14:23] <%Mattais88> Actually Jeff killed the first
[1:14:23] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> You helped
[1:14:24] <DatAsuna> You killed a remote controlled puppet
[1:14:25] <+cermo55> that was joker and thresher
[1:14:25] <Blackleafx> Shepherd is a thresher maw now
[1:14:27] <%watts121> Battle Ships killed Soverign, and a Giant Sand Worm killed the other.
[1:14:27] <Sp3ctre48> I think the giant worm did most of the work but okay
[1:14:28] <SaltyAzteca> You totally did though
[1:14:28] <%peachy996> With your bare hands!
[1:14:28] <%alphonseisbest> @GuilKato Aseri's boobs keep growing as they age, so IT may have closed at one point in time
[1:14:30] <TioXyco> she stroke your dick pretty hard there eh
[1:14:31] <%CalderGaming> you coordinated much of the effort that led to those victories
[1:14:31] <+Soliloquy123> in the same vein, TiM never brought on General Oleg to help Shep plan the mission?
[1:14:31] <%kujofire990> IT WAS KALOS
[1:14:32] <+GuilKato> Joker and Kaldros did that Samara not Shepard
[1:14:38] <%peachy996> And Harbinger was like wow you're cool
[1:14:42] <quipquest1> Hey, they need to breathe.
[1:14:45] <zerointelligence000> you got a participation trophy so more than most
[1:14:45] <%cooldude69xx> @GuilKato It looks like it's designed not to close actually
[1:14:52] <Blank9> mmmm, me, I did it all
[1:14:52] <blackjack8182> Joker and Kalros killed reapers
[1:14:56] <%JamesCorck> No he won't.
[1:14:59] <%JamesCorck> No he wouldn't.
[1:15:00] <SaltyAzteca> maybe
[1:15:02] <Sp3ctre48> tbf Shepard did kill Soverign and gave Joker the opening to kill the actual ship
[1:15:02] <%AllenDeadman> I wonder about that
[1:15:02] <Brandon__Brando> ya
[1:15:05] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt What if Kai Leng was a teammate in ME2 and stayed loyal to Cerberus in ME3?
[1:15:05] <%Afterman_> it wouldve been cooler if it was kaidan
[1:15:05] <%cooldude69xx> YEAH HE WOULD
[1:15:07] <%JamesCorck> Pat there's no universe where Kai Leng works.
[1:15:07] <%peachy996> And if he wasn't a Spacec Sasuke
[1:15:07] <%Deft_Thought> Kai Leng would be better if he didn't talk.
[1:15:07] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> that would help a lot
[1:15:07] <BurdRightsActivist> If he didn't exist
[1:15:07] <jorniev> IF HE DIDNT TALK
[1:15:08] <+Exicuren> So..... Saren
[1:15:08] <Make_me_mad> What if Kai Leng was Jacob.
[1:15:09] <AluxStreams> Kai Leng should have been a party member in ME2 or something.
[1:15:09] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> A good rival.
[1:15:09] <%watts121> Kai Leng but CYBER JENKINS!
[1:15:10] <cpt_langosta> what if kai leng was replaced by the surviving human crewmember from 1
[1:15:11] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Kai Leng would be better if he never said a fucking word
[1:15:11] <Sp3ctre48> I honestly don't think he would be LUL
[1:15:11] <%BioHunter> hes no zenos
[1:15:11] <+nivlac_555> definitely
[1:15:12] <%AmuserName> @PatStaresAt But you met him when you read the books! Kappa
[1:15:12] <%DracosMagala> Like Evil Verner???
[1:15:12] <$lotharrio> Yup. Should have been in ME2, like an early companion or something.
[1:15:12] <LightningLynx89> Kyle Lang
[1:15:13] <+ALazo> I think he would be much better if he wasn't an edgy ninja boi that said 'now it's fun'
[1:15:14] <%Mattais88> Like Conrad shows up as a badass sunddenly?
[1:15:15] <dekkitout> Verner shoulda been Leng
[1:15:15] <+FelIian> someone you fucked over in me1 or something
[1:15:15] <%sporeian94> a tiny bit, but still the space samurai ninja stuff doesn't help
[1:15:16] <BurdRightsActivist> MAKE HIM KARTH
[1:15:16] <%hrbeck_> waaaa
[1:15:16] <Profmcstevie> Whispers in the Citadel
[1:15:17] <ThatGuyThere03> imagine if Kai Leng was built up to, established properly, and wasn't an edgy ninja
[1:15:18] <+Soliloquy123> He should've been a squadmate in 2
[1:15:18] <DatAsuna> It's the halo problem, where you go from suddenly ignoring the books to suddenly shoving all of them in way later
[1:15:21] <+cermo55> he should have been a party member in 2, and the only one unloyal
[1:15:22] <%Afterman_> kai leng shouldve been kaidan change my mind
[1:15:24] <Blank9> just remember, kai leng is a joke and he becomes much better
[1:15:24] <%bassoontyphoon> Yyyuuuuppp
[1:15:28] <%JamesCorck> it would've made more sense if it had been a resucitated Saren.
[1:15:29] <%Ghufufin> it would double his coolness, but sadly 2x Zero is still Zero
[1:15:30] <BurdRightsActivist> REPLACE HIM WITH KARTH
[1:15:31] <$SGrim> He should have cum on you?
[1:15:31] <%OrangeMDT> but if you met him, wouldn't you have beaten him already?
[1:15:31] <%watts121> Or Kai Leng should have been Jacob.
[1:15:32] <%cvp5127> @PatStaresAt they should have gived him 2 squadmates
[1:15:32] <Brandon__Brando> the fact he shows up out of nowhere and demands respect it sucks
[1:15:35] <blackjack8182> He should of replaced Jacob
[1:15:36] <%peachy996> If Kai Leng was just Evil Bald Shepard instead of Sasuke it'd be better at least
[1:15:36] <Sp3ctre48> He definitely should have been in ME2 at the very least
[1:15:36] <+scrublordsamurai> he should have cummed on you
[1:15:37] <%tamale_senpai> Should have been Conrad turned evil
[1:15:38] <%stantheman_97> he should have cum on you
[1:15:39] <%sporeian94> you
[1:15:40] <%sunsetdisc0> the biggest problem with kai leng is that he's only ever able to get the upper hand because shep and co suddenly have only one brain cell between them
[1:15:41] <%strakillias> He'd be way better if he was just soldier man like Zaeed instead of a fucking ninja.
[1:15:44] <%watts121> and Jacob should have just been more capable
[1:15:44] <+Exicuren> Ah, Nihlus
[1:15:44] <%sporeian94> you're describing sephiroth
[1:15:44] <digaogrunge> He needed the Raiden treatment
[1:15:44] <%cooldude69xx> Did he exist when ME 2 happened?
[1:15:45] <%Puhff> phrasing
[1:15:47] <homestylewaffles> A little more exposure would've made him suck less, but he'd still suck.
[1:15:48] <jorniev> WHAT IF IT WAS JACOB?
[1:15:48] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Like Sepiroth
[1:15:52] <zerointelligence000> maybe have him be a companion who betrays you?
[1:15:53] <%BioHunter> so... kuvira?
[1:15:54] <zhenthrim213> they should have done a trails then
[1:15:54] <+justicevi4> kai leng should have been the one that died at virmire
[1:15:55] <Minorou> robo-ressurrected Nihlus
[1:15:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Or if he was Ashley/Kaiden rebuilt by Cerberus after ME1
[1:15:57] <%cactus_gato> @patstaresat it should've been a fucked up Cerberus-ified Jenkins
[1:15:58] <Make_me_mad> Kai Leng should have been the Virmire survivor.
[1:16:04] <mikeriffic> @PatStaresAt There is a mod that removes him from the game and replaces him with a generic phantom enemy
[1:16:07] <Ekaelis> That would require planning for such a character, something that doesn't happen for fanfic OC's
[1:16:08] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat I think Kai Leng would be more tolerable if everyone treated him like crap and acknowledged he was just the shitty replacement for Miranda Illusive Man had to get.
[1:16:08] <%xcompleasedad> @cooldude69xx In the books
[1:16:08] <cpt_langosta> but sephiroth is boring...
[1:16:08] <%charp35> Yeah and he shouldn't look like lame space weeb
[1:16:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @justicevi4 RIGHT?
[1:16:11] <Profmcstevie> That was a GREAT way to show how cool Sepiroth was in FF7
[1:16:13] <digaogrunge> he should've been a previous squadmate
[1:16:15] <%hrbeck_> or you have to leave him to  die or something
[1:16:17] <tanarath> Kai Leng should have been a decent part of ME 2 doing a few big things.
[1:16:18] <%greasypete00> why does she specifically look like an oblivion npc
[1:16:19] <ThatGuyThere03> Making it so Kai Leng is NOT ninja would automatically make him better
[1:16:20] <Blank9> he might've joined cerberus later, he was some court-martialed guy
[1:16:22] <%cooldude69xx> Somehow describing him as Sephiroth makes him sound less weeb ish
[1:16:22] <%alphonseisbest> PHANTOM KAI LENG MOD FTW
[1:16:23] <DatAsuna> You probably didn't get that far due to the feather OCD, but assassin's creed 3 had the exact same kai leng problem with Daniel Cross from the AC comics.
[1:16:23] <%MrWurmles> And then Shepard would be replaced by a rookie who has his memories, right?
[1:16:25] <%Afterman_> ye virmire survivor would be cool
[1:16:26] <%Mattais88> What if Kai Leng was instead the dead teammate from 1 who got cyborged up?
[1:16:26] <@QueequegTheater> @cpt_langosta Less boring than Kai Leng
[1:16:28] <ChungusQuest> "I will show you despair," he said between mouthfuls of Anderson's breakfast cereal
[1:16:28] <tanarath> Finding data etc
[1:16:29] <%hrbeck_> it should have been Jacob
[1:16:30] <quipquest1> Conrad was right
[1:16:33] <blackjack8182> A Brainwashed Miranda would have been cool
[1:16:35] <%watts121> @BallerSwagBro9k I would say that is stupid, but curing nuclear explosions is just as crazy as curing atmo reentry.
[1:16:38] <+GuilKato> nope shepard converted to Drell gods by reading Thane's bible!
[1:16:38] <%Afterman_> @Mattais88 id take that as well
[1:16:40] <cpt_langosta> @QueequegTheater true that
[1:16:41] <%cooldude69xx> @cooldude69xx I mean, were those books out?
[1:16:44] <medoodoo> "IM GONNA LIVE FOREEEEVA!"
[1:16:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @cpt_langosta HAVE U SEEN HIM WITHOUT A SHIRT?
[1:16:45] <%Afterman_> or or or
[1:16:48] <Sp3ctre48> I don't know if I like the Virmire Survivor thing but you probably could salvage that character if he just didn't have such a dumb design
[1:16:50] <jorniev> holy shit kaylang being replaced with the virmire survivor that would have been cool
[1:16:54] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> > Udina's name is Danelle what a fucking chode
[1:16:54] <%logoth_> BEACH YOU AWHHPP
[1:16:57] <+Exicuren> okokok, so Kai Leng should have been Conrad Kappa
[1:16:58] <%Afterman_> what if kai leng was a fuckin shepherd clone, good idea? dumb?
[1:16:59] <$lotharrio> Gonna punch the shit out of a little round boy.
[1:17:01] <BurdRightsActivist> @blackjack8182 The camera is literally up her ass in every boss fight, that's where the difficulty comes from
[1:17:05] <Blackleafx> WTF

[1:17:20] <Blackleafx> SNOOOOOF
[1:17:22] <%Puhff> LUL
[1:17:32] <hassanico2> WTF
[1:17:35] <+cermo55> In universe, Why does Leng have a  metal blade and not an omni lazer sword.
[1:17:36] <%Deft_Thought> Why would he keep that entry recorded
[1:17:42] <AngryAsian5> "Fighting the alliance is gonna help end the war." LUL
[1:17:55] <%jillyrancher> they super brainwashed
[1:18:00] <%tamale_senpai> @Afterman_ Woah now...
[1:18:01] <%xcompleasedad> @cermo55 Doesn't want to waste the batteries
[1:18:05] <%Daxalog> "Do it stink?"
[1:18:11] <@QueequegTheater> Poor Din. Can we get a Sadge in the chat

[1:19:04] <cpt_langosta> ZAEED NO
[1:19:04] <$SGrim> Good job Zaeed
[1:19:04] <%jillyrancher> Man Jetstream Sam would kill Kai Leng without even breaking a sweat.
[1:19:04] <@QueequegTheater> monkaS
[1:19:05] <%Afterman_> boom, i got it. What if Kai Leng was actually the corpse of shepherd from ME1 being controlled and our shep was just the clone?
[1:19:07] <%Daxalog> rip
[1:19:07] <+cermo55> @cermo55 no one else sees to have that issue, and is he just supposed to be so strong that it just works?

[1:19:16] <%MrWurmles> As good of an information broker as ME1 set him up to be, he should've known better than to leave traces of his connections to cereberus even in ME2.
[1:19:16] <jorniev> I FORGOT
[1:19:18] <%cooldude69xx> Shoot Zaeed in the other eye!
[1:19:18] <%CalderGaming> zaeed have bullet if you have coin

[1:19:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @jillyrancher Anyone from MGR really
[1:19:27] <blackjack8182> ZAEED!
[1:19:27] <AluxStreams> Fun fact: Zaeed was originally supposed to be the final boss of the Omega hub area before it was cut for DLC.
[1:19:30] <%bassoontyphoon> Shoulda let him burn
[1:19:34] <%Deft_Thought> Kai Leng was here, eating Din's cereal
[1:19:38] <DatAsuna> If you didn't do his loyalty in ME2, he would die in this quest.
[1:19:39] <%peyodogo> whats up with your pinky
[1:19:46] <%CalderGaming> that was a krogan
[1:19:47] <%MrWurmles> Krogan most likely.
[1:19:47] <%JamesCorck> Krogan.
[1:19:48] <@QueequegTheater> Krogan
[1:19:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Batarian

[1:20:01] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I'd be so hyped if they replaced Kai leng with Jetstream Sam
[1:20:04] <%peachy996> Yes speak out loud
[1:20:08] <AngryAsian5> After all the fights Shepard's been on the Citadel, you'd think he'd just wear his armor all the time.
[1:20:13] <+scrublordsamurai> Jem Hadar
[1:20:28] <medoodoo> i dont remember this - is this a DLC?
[1:20:28] <MauroUnit1> Damn,nho
[1:20:32] <+EvilErickan> he wore his armor in the 1st and 2nd
[1:20:40] <MauroUnit1> How long ago did he started playing?
[1:20:41] <%jillyrancher> Remember how Sam wipes the floor we with you despite him having hardly any cybernetics?
[1:20:42] <SaltyAzteca> PANICK'

[1:24:14] <Sp3ctre48> Why is Cerberus attacking a random Turian colony tho
[1:24:17] <majindusto> The Goblins grow restless
[1:24:21] <+GuilKato> its the KOTOR StarMap Puzzle!
[1:24:22] <$lotharrio> The vast majority of chat is innocent. Thus Chat is innocent.
[1:24:25] <knight_verse> This interaction is not timed, it's based on whether Zaeed is loyal or not.
[1:24:30] <%NopeBadguy> BEAT HIM
[1:24:31] <AngryAsian5> Beat him Zaeed LUL
[1:24:33] <cpt_langosta> "Beat him, Zaeed" was the other option
[1:24:43] <%NopeBadguy> BEAT HIS FUCKING ASS
[1:24:50] <akitanito> just poke a hole in his suit
[1:24:50] <%cooldude69xx> @Sp3ctre48 They're like random goblins that exist to make things harder for Shepard
[1:24:51] <%Deft_Thought> SPACE RACIS
[1:24:56] <+GuilKato> be the best tiny ball person you can be Din!
[1:24:59] <+Goraka91> HOW BIG IS CERBERUS
[1:25:01] <%RealThiele> Punt him into the sun
[1:25:03] <%jillyrancher> I really like Cerberus being enemies but God they use them WAAAAY too often in this game.
[1:25:04] <Blank9> good cop bad cop
[1:25:06] <$hattrick61> Use the racisim to twist his arm
[1:25:13] <%Deft_Thought> Zaeed's beefy ass arm is clipping into his body
[1:25:21] <%InternetShis> TIM has SO much money
[1:25:24] <%NopeBadguy> You should've beat him
[1:25:26] <%RealThiele> Cerberus grew by like 1000 people and 100 ships in 2 years
[1:25:27] <tattleworm> good job picking the blue option
[1:25:31] <cpt_langosta> nope
[1:25:32] <%SpcOpsBear> No.

[1:25:40] <Profmcstevie> Nice car part shoulder thing Zaeed
[1:25:42] <%toolofparanoia> YEA BOMBERS
[1:25:43] <+Goraka91> I swear we kill more Cerberus than we do Reapers and everyone from 2 combined
[1:25:45] <%jillyrancher> I mean Illusive Man gets like 4 billion credits a year
[1:25:50] <+titansloth93> Kinda wish they put more effort into Volus outfits, but I get it since they're pretty minor
[1:25:51] <Shade075> At this point Cerberus has like infinite resources
[1:25:51] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Socks innit
[1:25:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> All the characters return in Citadel DLC
[1:25:54] <%DoubleRrico> mr.gravel voice returns
[1:25:58] <+titansloth93> like to make them more unique
[1:25:58] <medoodoo> how do i not remember this mission - i can't recall this - maybe its been a long time
[1:26:01] <%maenos2> OH BOY
[1:26:03] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt the Citadel DLC was Zaeed's VA's last performance, rest in peace
[1:26:05] <%logoth_> Kaiden isnt dead?
[1:26:10] <mattynezz> I LOVE this conversation
[1:26:12] <%maenos2> ITZ TIME
[1:26:12] <%MrWurmles> Question: Why do the volus have a bombing fleet? According to thier codec the ONLY thing their races has ever had to contribute to the galactic society is the fact that they are good with money. They are pacifists otherwise.
[1:26:14] <%Dopamien> who?
[1:26:14] <%Bailey__gaming> BOMBERS DON'T WORK IN SPACE!!!!!
[1:26:15] <mattynezz> He's so LAME

[1:26:16] <blackjack8182> Isn’t Zaeed’s dialogue bugged
[1:26:16] <%jillyrancher> They also got a lot of resources from taking over Omega
[1:26:18] <+cermo55> Kaiden, life of the party
[1:26:19] <Sp3ctre48> Zaeed gets a conversation since people like him more than Kasumi Keepo
[1:26:21] <%sunsetdisc0> rip zaeed
[1:26:21] <%xcompleasedad> @Goraka91 I think the Mercs are a pretty big blob of death in 2

[1:31:59] <Shade075> Liara cant stop going after your dick in this
[1:31:59] <+el_of_house_wood> Safe
[1:32:01] <%Garthunox> By the way, Mass Effect copies a LOT from Star Trek
[1:32:01] <%DashXero> Tali might not like this.
[1:32:03] <%jillyrancher> @cpt_langosta I dunno her mind was literally eaten by a ancient Lovecraft monster, I can give her a pass
[1:32:04] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt to be fair you shot Liara too, but mom got a bullet and the daughter some goo.
[1:32:06] <%RetroCop87> Wanna bang? Hah hah, just kidding! ...unless...
[1:32:08] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU ALREADY SHOT HER DOWN
[1:32:09] <%InternetShis> IT'S VERY OBVIOUS

[1:32:30] <+Exicuren> You're fine, the game makes it very clear if you want to bone a character or not

[1:33:52] <%peachy996> She doesn't go away
[1:33:54] <+GuilKato> Liara wasn't a ghost!
[1:33:54] <Gorshum> He's super right.
[1:33:54] <$Futurecity10> She stays there for the rest of the game
[1:33:56] <mattynezz> That's just where she hangs out
[1:33:56] <+trackles_64> glitch
[1:33:57] <tanarath> He's 110% right
[1:34:03] <%peachy996> Go to Purgatory
[1:34:03] <%RealThiele> he saw your situation and was a bro
[1:34:04] <+NeonLight> "I guess Liara doesnt matter"
[1:34:08] <$haziqtheunique> Liara > Tali, honestly. Don't care what the fandom says, lmao.
[1:34:11] <+critikal_bit> Huh, when I saw that, he gave her supplies
[1:34:18] <shallaska> liara never matters
[1:34:20] <+pmtriox> Imagine that Pat, Imagine ME3's quest tracking is fucked beyond reason
[1:34:21] <%cooldude69xx> They made a good play giving us Tali when they made the rest of the quarians a bunch of deranged villains. She makes them morally gray with her hotness
[1:34:22] <tanarath> It's literally all the Quarians' fault.
[1:34:25] <%Deft_Thought> So is it Blussy with Liara or Asussy?
[1:34:31] <%jillyrancher> A Liar
[1:34:34] <%JamesCorck> Yepp.
[1:34:40] <akitanito> really bad undersells the problem
[1:34:42] <Blackleafx> @Deft_Thought Asussy baka
[1:34:42] <+pmtriox> they'll fix Tali's picture, but they won't fix this
[1:34:44] <secret_npc> Chat, what have I missed, what's happened today? 😬
[1:34:45] <quipquest1> You'd think they'd fix that instead of the Mako
[1:34:46] <%RealThiele> yea without Tali Quarians would be the absolute worst
[1:34:48] <%tamale_senpai> Pat try some guns before you start Quarian mission!

[1:37:03] <%watts121> There were times where I could see icons in other maps of the Citadel, cuz in reality the Citadel is just rooms above/below each other in the same space.
[1:37:04] <%RealThiele> look at the pretty water and grass

[1:37:59] <+TheFlyingChurro> This game is good but there is some baaaaaaad shit
[1:38:00] <%SpcOpsBear> The side quest with Noles was because someone was using Batarian codes illegally and the agent asked you to use Spectre status to look for the coes and turn them off.
[1:38:01] <cpt_langosta> CONSOLE, tho
[1:38:02] <%InternetShis> Can't wait for the best DLC only to be followed by the dumbest ending
[1:38:02] <%SpcOpsBear> @PatStaresAt

[1:38:50] <%topendbuzza> just to suffer
[1:38:50] <zerointelligence000> it's labor day maybe she's chilling
[1:38:52] <DatAsuna> Because DLC has to account for if you don't do it
[1:38:53] <%tamale_senpai> No Omega HUB cuz EA sheap
[1:38:56] <jorniev> what are the other specters currently operating?
[1:38:57] <%AmuserName> I'M BORED OF OMEGA LOL
[1:38:59] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I thought ME1 and 2'ss idequests were mostly bad too tbh
[1:39:01] <%MrWurmles> Becuase they didn't want to put Omega's city hub in the game and force you to have to go see her at Omega after the DLC.
[1:39:01] <blackjack8182> Why is she here?
[1:39:03] <%Saffry_Ruzin> God I'm starting to realize how low effort and bad this game is, holy shit
[1:39:03] <MidnightPacif1c> SourPls
[1:39:04] <%cooldude69xx> Nowhere else has big enough couches
[1:39:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> they like the penis music
[1:39:06] <+trackles_64> exposition
[1:39:07] <%Deft_Thought> Man, Aria sucks
[1:39:08] <%watts121> Cuz her couch is being refurbished.
[1:39:08] <%peachy996> It's easier to sit here!
[1:39:09] <zhenthrim213> IS IT?
[1:39:10] <%peachy996> OF COURSE
[1:39:13] <studleydoorite> from the dance club?
[1:39:14] <%jillyrancher> Oh hey Joker and EDI have a cute dialogue here
[1:39:15] <cpt_langosta> w-why? that makes no sense...?
[1:39:16] <+MightyDuckShoes> Does the Couch just follow her every where?
[1:39:16] <%unhuggable1> ?
[1:39:17] <Sp3ctre48> I love how nonsensical it is that finding some Asari literature gets you an entire fleet of their navy
[1:39:22] <%InternetShis> How?
[1:39:22] <%peachy996> It's easier for Bioware too
[1:39:23] <tanarath> Such a lazy way for her to still be here.
[1:39:25] <DatAsuna> They don't want to lock you out of her mediocre vanilla sidequest
[1:39:26] <%ahomeschooldropout> I would rather they didn't give an explanation
[1:39:29] <+GuilKato> you could ask about omega?
[1:39:30] <Blank9> morally stupid
[1:39:32] <+GuilKato> now she has it back
[1:39:32] <%RealThiele> id be more worried about cerberus assassins hiding in omega
[1:39:34] <%watts121> I mean she has to be there in case he didn't finish her regular quests.
[1:39:36] <%AllenDeadman> yeah
[1:39:38] <Dunmarkh> @MightyDuckShoes no, we found her couch in a sewer last stream
[1:39:40] <tanarath> Give her an entangled hologram.
[1:39:40] <DatAsuna> absolutely
[1:39:41] <$lotharrio> All asari
[1:39:41] <BurdRightsActivist> ?????
[1:39:45] <Sp3ctre48> Bro they love Liara and Aria so much
[1:39:51] <%JamesCorck> Aria is cool in 2, and then they overused her.
[1:39:52] <%cooldude69xx> What? But Aria is great! She's uhh... mean?
[1:39:59] <mattynezz> Aria is lame. She's just a less awful Kai Leng
[1:40:00] <Profmcstevie> If you're blue boy do you get lots of screen time
[1:40:00] <%JamesCorck> They gave her too much play in the books as well.

[1:40:17] <Madinki> They fucking LOVE Liara
[1:40:17] <%RealThiele> Aria feels like what some guy thinks a bad girl gangster would be
[1:40:19] <%DashXero> How is he able to even carry a drink?
[1:40:20] <%greasypete00> <3
[1:40:23] <$lotharrio> She's absorbing it for nutrients
[1:40:24] <%DrTomT18> aria has no redeeming qualities
[1:40:24] <+cermo55> its an upgrade
[1:40:26] <%watts121> I mean it's not so much they loved the characters, each character had a specific writer, and some writers quit after ME1/ME2...like Ashley's writer.
[1:40:28] <%InternetShis> She's powerful
[1:40:31] <+MightyDuckShoes> @Dunmarkh Oh right, The Elcor
[1:40:33] <Parapattern> I can't see EDI without thinking of that sexbot Futurama episode

[1:41:17] <%InternetShis> Sassy AI is the best

[1:41:41] <%lumporr> yo EDI rules

[1:41:49] <ape_hawk> dude, let your robo gf carry you, its hot
[1:41:50] <%cooldude69xx> EDI has a "light cruise" setting to keep from exploding Jokers bussy
[1:41:50] <%JoshManVGH> She will literally destroy him.

[1:41:54] <%DoubleRrico> you gave him the klingon mcguffin
[1:41:56] <%AmuserName> @PatStaresAt EDI and JOKESTER should have good ambient dialog here
[1:41:58] <AngryAsian5> Do it for the ROBUSSY

[1:42:03] <%InternetShis> Oh the jank is real
[1:42:14] <Blackleafx> nice hand
[1:42:17] <cpt_langosta> @PatStaresAt you can clip through a girl standing at the lower bar
[1:42:19] <%jillyrancher> Think EDI would peg Joker
[1:42:23] <zhenthrim213> hello fellow criminals
[1:42:25] <%JoshManVGH> What did Joker die of? CRUSHED PELVIS'!
[1:42:26] <secret_npc> I don't think the Bioware devs have ever been inside a club before
[1:42:28] <%MugenSandan> But ARE you?
[1:42:28] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> "Hello I am a Cop"
[1:42:28] <Madinki> I love that "Hey you didn't need to be a sexy robot to make me happy" - "That's bullshit Joker"- "yeah ya got me."
[1:42:33] <+MightyDuckShoes> Is Shepat shitting himself?
[1:42:33] <+beansoup> @jillyrancher that would break him :(

[1:42:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @jillyrancher it would just be a colonoscopy camera
[1:42:48] <+ThomasOfTroy> What does that mean
[1:42:53] <%sporeian94> There's a little club called The Man Hole up there
[1:42:55] <%peachy996> The club in Andromeda is the saddest thing lol
[1:42:57] <+ThomasOfTroy> Speak american
[1:42:59] <%stantheman_97> is that bad?
[1:42:59] <secret_npc> lol
[1:43:01] <DatAsuna> edmonton is the middle of nowhere
[1:43:02] <%watts121> Only things I know about Edmonton are from Bioware and Gundam Ironblooded Orphans.
[1:43:03] <%Mattais88> There isn't much to do there but drink
[1:43:04] <@Ranryu692> does that mean many clubs or none?
[1:43:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:43:07] <Sp3ctre48> Please explain for us Americans
[1:43:08] <DatAsuna> as in they have fuck all for nightlife
[1:43:08] <+garagon31> The Oilers suck
[1:43:08] <%Saffry_Ruzin> This game is painful to watch now
[1:43:09] <Profmcstevie> Small town problems
[1:43:10] <%jillyrancher> It's just snow?
[1:43:14] <dekkitout> Your silence says enough
[1:43:16] <%bassoontyphoon> Shame there’s no space rodeos
[1:43:18] <zhenthrim213> PAT
[1:43:18] <Psyramics> they haven't lived their whole lives in Edmonton, but on the other hand, they still have never been in a club before
[1:43:20] <+PenmanLupine> means nothing
[1:43:24] <%jillyrancher> pla explain
[1:43:25] <blackjack8182> The club in Andromeda is the size of a closet
[1:43:27] <%RealThiele> Edmonton is basically like saying Omaha is sooo big
[1:43:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I almost lived in Edmonton
[1:43:29] <cpt_langosta> pee pee and pee
[1:43:29] <%MugenSandan> @watts121 wait what does Edmonton have to do with Gundam
[1:43:30] <%NopeBadguy> PEE WITH PEE PEE
[1:43:31] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I feel like given the scale of the reaper war, that wall is SUPER small
[1:43:31] <%topendbuzza> oh no not the baby
[1:43:32] <Blank9> it means the night ends sad and cold, like all nights in edmonton
[1:43:33] <+ThomasOfTroy> @DatAsuna It has a population of 1 million people
[1:43:35] <Druss_M> on the baby I assume
[1:43:36] <%stantheman_97> no answer the question
[1:43:38] <%NateyBeak> elmo default state

[1:43:47] <%Puhff> dont drop the toilet paper this time
[1:43:50] <%jillyrancher> Big pp
[1:43:50] <%Mattais88> At least edmonton isn't Calgary
[1:43:50] <%Deft_Thought> Cuz of the Oilers? I dunno
[1:43:51] <%cooldude69xx> Edmonton bad
[1:43:51] <%DracosMagala> The most excitement Edmonton has gotten was in a Gundam anime blackk4Tea
[1:43:52] <Virokwet> ?
[1:43:52] <%InternetShis> *Refuses to elaborate* *Leaves*
[1:43:56] <%king_wragles> Pat said Edmenton because they have clubs and heroine
[1:43:58] <akitanito> edmonton has nothing
[1:43:59] <leinadtonu> explain chat. Chat needs to know
[1:44:00] <%watts121> @MugenSandan there is a battle in Edmonton at the end of Iron-Blooded Orphans
[1:44:01] <%sporeian94> Eastern Canadians and Western Canadians hate each other apparently, it's like a america north-south kinda thing
[1:44:04] <%demiiluna> what's an edmonton
[1:44:05] <%NateyBeak> i heard edmonton is just like a mall and parking lots
[1:44:06] <%stantheman_97> any canucks here?
[1:44:11] <DatAsuna> @DatAsuna and what else is around it? miles upon miles of fucking nothing
[1:44:12] <Blank9> I have 2 friends that lived in there and moved out because it made them want to die
[1:44:12] <secret_npc> Sounds like Edmonton is a quiet city with little to do recreationally
[1:44:17] <+TDotGoat> Edmonton is where souls go to die
[1:44:23] <DorpPorp> we live in sad gray cubes with a chocolate milk river
[1:44:25] <%DoubleRrico> wiki says A resident of Edmonton is known as an Edmontonian
[1:44:25] <Blank9> I imagine it's like living in kansas, but also alaska
[1:44:27] <%jillyrancher> All the French live in the west right
[1:44:28] <WebmanJax> It's because after Quebec, Edmonton is the shittiest place in the country.
[1:44:29] <%sporeian94> I'm Minnesotan so I'm like half honorary candian
[1:44:30] <%OrangeMDT> So the thing about the gear wars is that it was never really about the gears...
[1:44:31] <%AmericanSkidd> sounds familiar
[1:44:35] <%Mr_Pylon> Edmonton is one of those cities with nothing, and then they build something stupidly big to go "Look! We've got the BIGGEST MALL! Edmonton yeah!"
[1:44:39] <%peachy996> Andromeda Nexus Bar: Size of A closet with a lone woman standing on stage, no hair, pitch black eyes.
[1:44:43] <DatAsuna> Edmonton is like being in the capital of a flyover state, sure it's a city, but it's a shitty city
[1:44:44] <%Mattais88> @sporeian94 Sort of, only to the west of Alberta you've got BC, which aside from all the stoners is pretty cool
[1:44:44] <%cooldude69xx> @sporeian94 I dunno. Im from the east coast and I want to throw balls of avocado toast at californians
[1:44:50] <%LeiaSkynoober> @jillyrancher East actually.
[1:44:51] <dekkitout> @WebmanJax Can someone pin this
[1:44:58] <%watts121> It should be noted that most Canadians live in the corridor around the Great Lakes. I lived in Michigan for awhile, and saw Canadians all the fucking time.
[1:44:58] <mattynezz> Well you see, Pat is from a place called Montreal. To live in Montreal you need to sign a contract agreeing to talk down to every other city in Canada. It's the law
[1:45:05] <Aoworth> The way Edmonton has always been described to me sounds like the same kind of hollowed out deindustrialized cities in Ohio
[1:45:10] <%jillyrancher> oh ok
[1:45:25] <%AmericanSkidd> I grew up in one of those kinds of places, where you have to go to another town to do anything interesting
[1:45:27] <%RealThiele> chat salty bout edmonton shittalking LUL
[1:45:32] <@QueequegTheater> Americans, Edmonton is like Topeka
[1:45:35] <%peachy996> Yeah but Montreal is a silly joke
[1:45:35] <ChungusQuest> I'm picturing Edmonton as something like Duluth, Minnesota. Is that pretty close?
[1:45:36] <%LeiaSkynoober> @jillyrancher All the French live on the East coast. Quebec and the other maritime provinces formerly known as Arcadia
[1:45:39] <%strakillias> @Mr_Pylon For American's sake, Edmonton sounds like the Oklahoma city of Canada
[1:45:41] <akitanito> edmonton's in alberta where they are now only known for tar sands
[1:45:43] <secret_npc> I flew to the Gold Coast in Australia to work on one of the Pirates movies, the night life was very concentrated, as soon as you stepped outside the CBD area it was dead
[1:45:50] <%watts121> @QueequegTheater so fly over territory
[1:45:56] <%peachy996> It's like if Florida was talking down to everyone else in the US. LOL you're Florida
[1:45:58] <%Treuan> Nice to meet you, Back
[1:46:04] <%stantheman_97> i understand now
[1:46:06] <akitanito> of course
[1:46:10] <%NopeBadguy> No, I just played MTGA
[1:46:11] <@Ranryu692> there are multiple Canadian cities????
[1:46:13] <%cooldude69xx> @mattynezz This reminds me of the time I found out they have real laws demanding all signs to have bigger signs in french than english
[1:46:15] <%watts121> jeez did you piss in the corner?
[1:46:17] <+ThomasOfTroy> @watts121 I live in the detroit metro NOW, there aren't THAT many canadians
[1:46:19] <@QueequegTheater> Fuck Canada
[1:46:20] <+GuilKato> that edmonton doesn't make their Poutine correctly?
[1:46:20] <dekkitout> Seems civil by chat's standards
[1:46:21] <%king_wragles> I told them it's the heroine city, cause that's all I know
[1:46:23] <%Puhff> I think I've heard shittalking about every major Canadian city now except Vancouver. Everyone seems to like the Couv
[1:46:25] <Blank9> edmonton is kansas, but with alaska temperature
[1:46:27] <%Jeemukun> Acadian, not Arcadian
[1:46:27] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Canada is just a hat
[1:46:28] <%jillyrancher> Florida is where boomers go to rot away
[1:46:36] <Aoworth> We all just said soory to one another

[1:48:46] <%watts121> Like how in ME2...Zaeed doesn't do dialogue wheels.

[1:48:51] <zerointelligence000> think you got it out of order

[1:50:48] <%InternetShis> BIRD LEGION
[1:50:54] <Make_me_mad> Kelly joined Cerberus because boning aliens is hotter when you're role playing as a space racist.

[1:51:34] <%JamesCorck> It is.
[1:51:35] <@Ranryu692> keep playing the game
[1:51:35] <mattynezz> It's being attacked at this point
[1:51:36] <%cooldude69xx> Citadel might be closer to where they were
[1:51:37] <DatAsuna> colonies nearer the citadel *shrug*
[1:51:37] <AluxStreams> Illium got rekt already so
[1:51:37] <%MrWurmles> Is it not, though? Do you know that?
[1:51:39] <mr_saturday93> uuuhhhh
[1:51:39] <%KetsuoTaberu> funny you should mention it
[1:51:40] <%JamesCorck> They just started being attacked.
[1:51:41] <jorniev> WE NEED TO DEFEAT THE COVID
[1:51:41] <%tamale_senpai> NOW GUNS!!!!
[1:51:41] <@QueequegTheater> Not all Asari live on Thessia
[1:51:42] <%toolofparanoia> Dr. Chocolates!
[1:51:43] <Virokwet> ?
[1:51:43] <+SataruYamate> Ilium refugees?
[1:51:43] <%Monkeyweed21> the colonies are starting to get hit
[1:51:44] <%RealThiele> super not attacked
[1:51:45] <%tamale_senpai> GUNS!
[1:51:46] <+GuilKato> they were the asari living on other planets banging turians
[1:51:47] <secret_npc> Through Aria, the Asari have had pull in the Terminus System the whole time and haven't told anyone
[1:51:48] <hassanico2> The Citadel is safe
[1:51:48] <cpt_langosta> no theres no time
[1:51:49] <+ThomasOfTroy> Would you want to live in post-war Berlin?
[1:51:50] <%tamale_senpai> GUNS!GUNS!
[1:51:50] <%peachy996> @secret_npc he did the paragon route
[1:51:51] <%kujofire990> nah thessia is just getting hit
[1:51:51] <zerointelligence000> they do plow a lot of different aliens
[1:51:51] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Not all Asari live on Thessia or like it there
[1:51:52] <%watts121> I imagine Thessia is expensive.
[1:51:54] <Sp3ctre48> I mean, I'm sure there are lots of Asari planets that are being attacked by Reapers
[1:51:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> well that answers my question of what i've missed
[1:51:56] <%InternetShis> How close is Thessia to the Citadel
[1:51:57] <%tamale_senpai> GUNS!
[1:51:57] <willyfreshness> lotta blussy

[1:52:04] <DatAsuna> maybe they have family or connections on the citadel instead of thessia
[1:52:04] <lord_sykos> There's one more mission you can do here
[1:52:07] <%watts121> It's like telling a refugee to just move to New York
[1:52:07] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Can every white person in bad situations just move to Europe?
[1:52:08] <%moonmintparadise> I imagine it very hard for civilians that find themselves in a refugee situations to just fly to safety, I guess
[1:52:08] <Virokwet> just go to the part of space with no reapers
[1:52:09] <GustauveVIII> what happens if two asari vampires tried to sex each other
[1:52:14] <+GuilKato> you have more batarian codes to collect - here at the Dock!
[1:52:15] <%DrTomT18> @internetshis pretty close
[1:52:15] <mattynezz> You STILL didn't finish that quest that confused you
[1:52:23] <%AmericanSkidd> one more
[1:52:27] <%JoshManVGH> If you had a planet full of biotics, would that plant be in danger of anything?
[1:52:36] <ChungusQuest> BATARRORISM
[1:52:37] <%DrTomT18> the last one is in the refugee camp

[1:53:08] <%alphonseisbest> FUCKIN BATTIES
[1:53:16] <%AmericanSkidd> yeah, that dude

[1:53:18] <secret_npc> You'll like this Pat
[1:53:18] <%cooldude69xx> The dude from the rock!
[1:53:23] <Shade075> Pat you shouldnt have stopped with just destroying their planet!
[1:53:26] <akitanito> still worth it
[1:53:26] <ChungusQuest> it had to be done
[1:53:27] <%DrTomT18> very end of the docks
[1:53:28] <%AmericanSkidd> nah, fuck that dude
[1:53:37] <%DoubleRrico> you probably should have warned them before their planet exploded
[1:53:37] <Dunmarkh> you did the right thing probably
[1:53:38] <%alphonseisbest> U HAD TOO
[1:53:38] <%dooscent> shooting a batarian is how shepard introduces himself. just in general.
[1:53:39] <Make_me_mad> The second in command was okay. This dude though.
[1:53:39] <Parapattern> He was coming right at me
[1:53:40] <mattynezz> Far end
[1:53:40] <%RealThiele> natural reaction
[1:53:40] <%toolofparanoia> Shooting batarians is always the right call
[1:53:41] <Psyramics> gotta make that batarian a deadtarian
[1:53:42] <+GuilKato> Pat you did the right thing
[1:53:42] <$lotharrio> Yeah but fuck them Batarians. "Slavery is my culture"
[1:53:46] <cpt_langosta> botch-tarians
[1:53:49] <%alphonseisbest> U MADE THE right choice
[1:53:51] <%MrWurmles> Map.
[1:53:52] <%Deft_Thought> Are you sorry because it was the wrong thing to do or are you sorry because they're a threat
[1:53:53] <Make_me_mad> What's worse, Batarians or Vorcha?
[1:53:57] <%JamesCorck> Not really.
[1:53:58] <Sp3ctre48> I kinda hate how they get treated
[1:53:58] <secret_npc> Very end of the docks
[1:54:02] <%peachy996> At no point did Bioware think "Hey let's make a Batarian Squadmember"
[1:54:04] <+ThomasOfTroy> No
[1:54:05] <dekkitout> We shoulda got Bray
[1:54:08] <haisho> Batarians for sure.
[1:54:08] <%cooldude69xx> They're laughably 2 dimensional
[1:54:13] <%JamesCorck> You needed a Garak.
[1:54:14] <Blank9> you need one universally hated species after the reapers are dealt with
[1:54:15] <willyfreshness> Batarians dont have anything cool about em tho
[1:54:15] <%tamale_senpai> yOU GET TO PLAY bATARIANS IN mULTIPLAYER
[1:54:16] <Make_me_mad> Vorcha feel like cartoon villains so I feel like they're maybe less bad.
[1:54:16] <%ArdentHeart312> I saw a lotta people saying zaeed should of been batarian
[1:54:16] <%AmericanSkidd> Garrus did when he was on Omega
[1:54:17] <akitanito> Just make Jacob Batarian
[1:54:17] <+GuilKato> or a free bataraian colony of Non Slavery based bataraians to hang out
[1:54:17] <@QueequegTheater> Bray should've joined the team
[1:54:18] <%topendbuzza> gives us more aliens
[1:54:18] <haisho> Vorcha can be cool. Sometimes.
[1:54:19] <zerointelligence000> it feels weird how they made a race that's just so easy to hate
[1:54:19] <%JoshManVGH> You got Bray for a bit
[1:54:19] <%RealThiele> the writing really scapegoats the shit outta them
[1:54:19] <%InternetShis> Bray is the best we get
[1:54:20] <%JamesCorck> You need someone like Garak from DS9.
[1:54:20] <%DoubleRrico> nearest you got was the option to play them in multipleyer
[1:54:21] <ThatGuyThere03> Pat, the Batarians are too fucking ugly for that
[1:54:21] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Some people are just assholes.
[1:54:21] <GustauveVIII> how would you make batarians not look like other batarians tho
[1:54:21] <+jerkhov> maybe it's because there are no normal ones
[1:54:22] <secret_npc> You know what you must do, Pat
[1:54:22] <+miguelrod777> LUL
[1:54:23] <AluxStreams> ME2's development planned for a batarian crew member.
[1:54:24] <Sp3ctre48> At least the Batarian's in the multiplayer are cool
[1:54:26] <%AmericanSkidd> oops
[1:54:27] <mattynezz> Pat, DON'T comit space racism here
[1:54:27] <%JamesCorck> Someone who could humanise the Batarians.
[1:54:27] <%hrbeck_> no, they are all evil
[1:54:28] <%Monkeyweed21> there are like 2 non evil batarians and one of them is a side npc you can ignore
[1:54:28] <%Treuan> Wrex.
[1:54:28] <AngryAsian5> HOW DOES NO ONE SEE THAT
[1:54:28] <%JoshManVGH> Oof
[1:54:29] <akitanito> that gun was weird
[1:54:29] <%moonmintparadise> Yeah its weird that apparently all Batarians are assholes
[1:54:29] <+bugz_munny> FUCKIN BATARIANS
[1:54:30] <Sp3ctre48> YOU
[1:54:30] <%peachy996> Not in ME2 or 3 where it would have mattered

[1:54:34] <+ThomasOfTroy> No, I don't. That sounds awful. A Garak would be great, but not a party member
[1:54:34] <quipquest1> Batarians are Space Pirates
[1:54:35] <%AmuserName> YOU SHOULD BE GREEN, BALAK
[1:54:36] <Blackleafx> also nice hoodie clip
[1:54:36] <%senfood> GODDAMN BATARIANS

[1:54:37] <%walternatorz> imagine writing an objectively bad race
[1:54:37] <AngryAsian5> LITERALLY OUT IN THE OPEN
[1:54:38] <%RealThiele> oh no
[1:54:40] <Shade075> we needed a hot batarian waifu to help us forget their war crimes
[1:54:41] <%cooldude69xx> @peachy996 There was a cut batarian engineer who was supposed to be in ME2
[1:54:42] <Sp3ctre48> LUL
[1:54:45] <%MugenSandan> Mass Effect has the same problem as Star Trek which is the second they humanize an alien race they need a new bad alien race
[1:54:45] <jorniev> BATARIANS ARE RPO SLAVERY THOUGH
[1:54:47] <DatAsuna> THAT'S ALL ALRIGHT
[1:54:48] <%AmuserName> Y U NOT GREEN?!
[1:54:56] <Dunmarkh> no?

[1:59:47] <+Goraka91> I feel bad for the Vorcha, Batarians? Fuck 'em
[1:59:47] <ExpressNode> Twitch doesn't seem to give me notifications even after turning off that smart shit
[1:59:51] <jorniev> @SaltyAzteca so he died slower
[1:59:53] <$hattrick61> Yeah vorcha are basically immune to indoctrination and conventional warfare
[1:59:54] <%chill_o_wisp> LOL BY3
[1:59:55] <%Conscript_Gary> ah heck I just tuned in, what've we done so far tonight
[1:59:55] <BoneofMalkav> Is Pat thinking about Robot Butts in Robot Space? It's possible LUL

[2:00:01] <%InternetShis> Wife
[2:00:02] <%tinyswampthing> the vorcha are hard to fight becasue their homeworld is hell and they dont give a shot about anything

[2:00:30] <%jillyrancher> Nothing let's go
[2:00:32] <haisho> oh right the Third Fleet went DOWN
[2:00:35] <%tamale_senpai> @hassanico2 Being in a suit all day you get kinda sweaty
[2:00:39] <+MakishimaWolf> @PatStaresAt The head of tripwire interactive just stepped down
[2:00:40] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:00:40] <%cooldude69xx> @tinyswampthing The reapers try all their usual tactics, but vorcha dont give a shit, its hilarious
[2:00:40] <count_bob> you lost points.
[2:00:41] <%logoth_> "I'm helping!"
[2:00:44] <%RealThiele> 5 points for battle tits
[2:00:45] <Profmcstevie> The Vorcha and the Krogan are so good for this war because they were RAISED in hellish worlds
[2:00:47] <LightningLynx89> Third Fleet go down cause you kill Balak
[2:00:48] <%InternetShis> It do go down
[2:00:58] <%king_wragles> just do the thing

[2:01:16] <%Conscript_Gary> sometimes number go down in war
[2:01:17] <hassanico2> Oh no now we won't get GREEN ending whatever will we do
[2:01:17] <Dunmarkh> @MightyDuckShoes terrorism
[2:01:18] <%Monkeyweed21> you'll get plenty
[2:01:21] <Make_me_mad> Should have had a Vorcha crew member.
[2:01:22] <jorniev> NUMBER GO DOWN
[2:01:23] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Batarians burn in hell
[2:01:24] <%king_wragles> no, not reload. 'the thing'
[2:01:27] <%cooldude69xx> Can you shoot Balak again?
[2:01:29] <%tinyswampthing> the vorcha also dont really need to eat if i recall
[2:01:32] <%IamGrapes> wait, the goblins have no effect here?
[2:01:34] <Blackleafx> I like how Pat always stops to go through th scanner
[2:01:38] <mattynezz> What if you lost EXACTLY the amount of points you needed?
[2:01:40] <+MightyDuckShoes> The Galaxy is worth dying to purge the Batarians
[2:01:40] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you kill more batarians long term by recruiting them into the war tho
[2:01:41] <tanarath> You saved a colony
[2:01:42] <%tamale_senpai> Vorcha should have been the cook
[2:01:46] <%Conscript_Gary> Vega is basically our krogan and vorcha crew member
[2:01:46] <%Mattais88> Elcor is the one I wanted
[2:01:47] <dekkitout> What role for a Vorcha crew member?
[2:01:49] <Parapattern> Killing Batarians is non-negotiable
[2:01:51] <%kujofire990> Bill the Vorcha
[2:01:51] <LLCoolZJ> Pat having his Starlord punching Thanos moment.
[2:01:52] <hassanico2> ehhh... Vorcha only live 20 years and are super dumb
[2:01:53] <Dunmarkh> romanceable vorcha crew member
[2:01:55] <%RealThiele> vorcha cook/janitor
[2:01:55] <%SpcOpsBear> Guys, just let Pat play the way he wants and then make fun of him for his mistakes, rather than getting angy when he doesn't do exactly what you said to do </hypocritical>
[2:01:56] <%toolofparanoia> HANAR CREW MEMEBER AND HE'S A MEDICAL ASSISTANT...
[2:01:56] <Maids4lyfe> Vorcha crewmate named Snots
[2:01:57] <%tamale_senpai> Cook!
[2:01:58] <DatAsuna> There are unironically more "good vorcha" than good batarians in ME3 despite being a joke race
[2:01:59] <+Goraka91> Shout out to that one time Asari raised Vorcha right but they abandoned it because they all kept dying and couldn't handle it
[2:02:01] <+ScrapKingKeita> I wonder if the Vorcha count as a space faring species for the Reapers to harvest, since they basically got smuggled
[2:02:01] <secret_npc> @hassanico2 You mean he can't turn into a husk at the end, OH NO
[2:02:03] <haisho> speaking of which holy shit I loved the Vorcha in MP
[2:02:04] <%InternetShis> There was a Vorcha character in Multiplayer
[2:02:07] <%cooldude69xx> @dekkitout Would have been a wild engineer
[2:02:09] <Blank9> shepard needs more batarians alive for post-war, to have something to look forward to
[2:02:15] <%tamale_senpai> Like Gordon Ramsey
[2:02:15] <%cooldude69xx> @dekkitout BREAK FANS
[2:02:20] <+critikal_bit> Vorcha in multiplayer were bomb
[2:02:20] <parad0xvoid> Siding with the reapers to abduct femails?
[2:02:22] <Shade075> Vorcha are space Tarkatans
[2:02:25] <hassanico2> Multiplayer had the BIOTIC VOLUS
[2:02:27] <%NopeBadguy> Don't forget to check with Glyph

[2:07:08] <tanarath> Energy drain + sabotage first
[2:07:08] <%Agami23> the best defense is always an overwhelming offence
[2:07:10] <DatAsuna> drones are better for crowd control than damage yeah
[2:07:21] <DatAsuna> sabotage is also a strong CC ability
[2:07:28] <%tamale_senpai> Defense Drone protects Tali if enemies get to close
[2:07:32] <DatAsuna> if you max it, it just explodes their guns
[2:07:39] <cpt_langosta> what the fuck is a samoflange?

[2:09:49] <%PunchSlugfest> "I hope you two are happy" = "Fuck you, bitch"
[2:09:50] <%Conscript_Gary> Liara watching with a tub of ice cream and crying
[2:09:51] <willyfreshness> dammit i went to piss and missed it
[2:09:52] <secret_npc> Okay, that's the Liara dialogue, time to bring EDI in
[2:09:52] <%watts121> did they remove the cat fight?
[2:09:54] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> If they're in zero G why aren't Liara's eyes exploding?
[2:09:55] <%Mattais88> "I see a lot of things, and then sell them to Fornax"
[2:09:56] <PaperyHornet1013> she can bring up talis spank bank
[2:09:58] <medoodoo> LIARA 4EVA!
[2:10:00] <Madinki> VERY PASSIVE AGRESSIVE THERE
[2:10:01] <%SpcOpsBear> SPACE WALK
[2:10:02] <GustauveVIII> GET READY FOR THE COOL
[2:10:03] <%AmuserName> Awwwww, damn. There's one variant where Liara calls her out for her suit-vibrator @PatStaresAt
[2:10:05] <LLCoolZJ> Shepard will do it, because he's a man.
[2:10:11] <+pmtriox> may your disappointment be as thorough as is appropriate
[2:10:13] <cpt_langosta> you've been in space this whole time
[2:10:17] <%Ghufufin> u member that timein ME1
[2:10:17] <%IamGrapes> wait did she see the boning in ME2?
[2:10:18] <Dunmarkh> super mario galaxy shit
[2:10:18] <SaltyAzteca> DO A DEAD SPACE
[2:10:19] <%Mattais88> I really like this bit
[2:10:19] <akitanito> oh no is the space suit walk section
[2:10:19] <%tamale_senpai> Remember Dead Space Pat?
[2:10:19] <+GuilKato> @Conscript_Gary nah she was going ooooh Embrace Eternity you two, embrace it!
[2:10:19] <%jillyrancher> Yeah I love this mission
[2:10:21] <jorniev> This is aparently one of the better moments
[2:10:21] <%RetroCop87> Shepard gettin' some PTSD
[2:10:22] <%InternetShis> @PatStaresAt If you didn't bang Liara prior, she brings up Tali downloading vibrators
[2:10:23] <spuginky> yay Dead Space reference
[2:10:25] <%NopeBadguy> Yo I love Super Mario Galaxy 3
[2:10:26] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Thats later
[2:10:27] <zhenthrim213> excuse  me
[2:10:30] <secret_npc> Don't romance Tali
[2:10:31] <%RealThiele> THE BABY
[2:10:34] <%CalderGaming> I think you need to not have cleanly cut one off
[2:10:34] <%maenos2> @iamgrapes almost certainly
[2:10:35] <slix3431> Nice
[2:10:36] <LLCoolZJ> Liara can vibrate herself whenever she wants!
[2:10:39] <%crassletter> "nerve stim pro?"
[2:10:41] <peanutdot007> Where are the bullet bills?
[2:10:42] <+Soliloquy123> I think you have to have not romanced Liara prior
[2:10:44] <%topendbuzza> shh chat
[2:10:45] <%rekinom> You wouldn't download a vibrator
[2:10:46] <+trackles_64> this will end badly
[2:10:50] <medoodoo> PAT ARE YOU ROMANCING LIARA OR TALI?
[2:10:53] <akitanito> I don't like this kotor1 reference
[2:10:54] <%RetroCop87> This feels like a Sonic special stage
[2:10:55] <zhenthrim213> like the view of your people dying
[2:10:55] <%RealThiele> Tali do vibrate a lot
[2:10:56] <%watts121> This spot is sorta dumb now that I'm seeing it
[2:10:56] <cpt_langosta> YET
[2:10:58] <sendart> you dont know that
[2:10:59] <%lumporr> even during the missions?
[2:10:59] <%watts121> like what's it's purpose?
[2:11:00] <%Mattais88> That you know of
[2:11:01] <jorniev> DAMN
[2:11:01] <%AmericanSkidd> Unlike the Spartan armor, quarian suits jerk you off
[2:11:02] <ape_hawk> you dont know they dont
[2:11:03] <$hattrick61> Tali youre going to love the view of your homeworld on fire
[2:11:03] <%LeiaSkynoober> @medoodoo Tali
[2:11:03] <%JamesCorck> pew pew pewwwww
[2:11:05] <Profmcstevie> Awesome sex vampires
[2:11:05] <%SpcOpsBear> Tali is waifu
[2:11:06] <%JamesCorck> Air Horn.
[2:11:08] <%stantheman_97> you don't know that
[2:11:08] <%DoubleRrico> cool sequence but can't he just jump it?
[2:11:08] <+critikal_bit> As far as we know
[2:11:09] <%DrTomT18> FYI, Liara is like, super obsessed with Shepard.
[2:11:10] <%Deft_Thought> At least the sex vampires can go outside
[2:11:10] <+Goraka91> LUL OH NO
[2:11:11] <%alphonseisbest> YET
[2:11:11] <SaltyAzteca> @crassletter Deluxe
[2:11:12] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> You don't know that
[2:11:12] <%lumporr> ayo
[2:11:12] <%cooldude69xx> THRILLING GAMEPLAY
[2:11:14] <%Conscript_Gary> clunkclunkclunkclunkclunkclunkclunkclunk
[2:11:16] <DatAsuna> needs more sharks
[2:11:18] <%maenos2> @medoodoo did you not just see the previous scene?
[2:11:25] <$lotharrio> Walking simulator...
[2:11:25] <@Lion_kun> Look at this dead space.
[2:11:26] <%Mr_Pylon> Isaac Clarke would have cleared this in 10 seconds
[2:11:26] <%watts121> another thing...why would the Geth's need gravity
[2:11:31] <Sp3ctre48> haha Geth windows I get it
[2:11:33] <dekkitout> Maybe Paige had a point about spac- I mean night time being overwhelming
[2:11:33] <medoodoo> @maenos2 i know i was being hopeful
[2:11:34] <+GuilKato> that you know of Pat - Quarians could make space vampire children
[2:11:34] <%stantheman_97> LUL
[2:11:35] <+pmtriox> remember when you ran up the side of the citadel? at full speed? I do
[2:11:37] <%DrTomT18> I have a theory about the end of the game that's very unsettling about Liara
[2:11:40] <secret_npc> This part is cool
[2:11:42] <intestinal_bleeding> boop bweep boop bweep
[2:11:45] <%Agami23> the geth seem really, really dumb
[2:11:46] <zhenthrim213> Legion would look outside
[2:11:50] <%xcompleasedad> @watts121 They like their android bodies
[2:11:52] <+ALazo> You could just... install cameras
[2:11:52] <%cooldude69xx> Joker out here thinking geth are gonna rebuild their whole fleet
[2:11:57] <LLCoolZJ> Geth haven't discovered translucent aluminum.
[2:11:58] <%ZephynM> This part of the game looks dreadful ngl
[2:11:58] <%JoshManVGH> Almost spaced again
[2:12:00] <%Ravioli_Ronin> THEY DONT HAVE CAMERAS THO?
[2:12:00] <Blackleafx> and then shepherd bunt up in orbit, again
[2:12:05] <Parapattern> Why would Geth need a ship that people could traverse?
[2:12:10] <%RealThiele> i mean the geth are prone to making dumb decisions just like any other race
[2:12:10] <secret_npc> @drtomt18 I'm interested, drop it in the final stream
[2:12:24] <cpt_langosta> if there's another tube, why didn't you just fly to that one before sending shepard in alone?
[2:12:24] <%AmericanSkidd> I feel like Shepard would have massive anxiety doing space walks after dying
[2:12:36] <knotsundownsyndrome> here's a good question, why do geth necessarily need a pressurized ship
[2:12:37] <Sp3ctre48> It doesn't exactly make sense when you think about it but just don't think about it LUL
[2:12:37] <$lotharrio> @Parapattern For holding their combat frames I guess? Or because they want to show off to Quarians, one day.
[2:12:39] <+GuilKato> @Parapattern they do have the robot bodies and colossi
[2:12:42] <%Mattais88> @Parapattern They say its so they can use the platforms for maitence
[2:12:45] <+DrGecko> is this Warframe
[2:12:47] <secret_npc> Chat, what did Pat do in Legion's loyalty mission? Rewrite or kill the Heretics?
[2:12:54] <%DrTomT18> @secret_npc I can dm you lol
[2:13:02] <stormhawk9891> @secret_npc Kill
[2:13:03] <%Conscript_Gary> Kill because he's not a monster iirc
[2:13:04] <zhenthrim213> kiss him on the eyeball
[2:13:05] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Kill
[2:13:09] <Madinki> @AmericanSkidd Yeah that would have been a neat story thing
[2:13:10] <Dunmarkh> @secret_npc kill, because that's "ethical"
[2:13:11] <secret_npc> @drtomt18 aight
[2:13:18] <%OrangeMDT> How is Shepard not triggering alarms? This only worked last time because Legion super hacked the cameras and sensors
[2:13:20] <%ahomeschooldropout> Is there an Star Trek episode about one of the crew having intense anxiety because of all the fucked up shit that happens outside of Brocolli
[2:13:24] <%peachy996> Except he is a monster
[2:13:28] <%jillyrancher> @knotsundownsyndrome Why do you think you're wearing a full airtight suit? they dont.
[2:13:35] <%peachy996> Just not in that particular situation
[2:13:45] <knotsundownsyndrome> @jillyrancher airlock
[2:13:45] <cpt_langosta> why ladder on geth ship
[2:13:49] <secret_npc> Okay good, you can't support Geth as a lifeform and rewrite their code at the same time
[2:13:51] <%strakillias> Why is flare, which is just an explosion, the coolest biotic power?
[2:13:53] <%PhantomMiG> Why do geth have airlocks
[2:13:59] <Alzero83> they will when your Banging Tali
[2:13:59] <GustauveVIII> geth ships have no atmosphere
[2:14:13] <Sp3ctre48> The ethical choice between brainwashing a sentient race and genociding them for wrongthink Keepo
[2:14:17] <+GuilKato> @secret_npc eh I was they're alive, but was happy to brainwash the heretics
[2:14:20] <%sunsetdisc0> @PhantomMiG it was a docking tube
[2:14:22] <%cooldude69xx> @strakillias Its a really cool explosion
[2:14:22] <quipquest1> @strakillias Because it's purple
[2:14:23] <%DoubleRrico> so do vanguards in lore just fly around like saiyans?
[2:14:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> that helmet looks EVIL AS SHIT
[2:14:23] <count_bob> you still have to dock other ships.
[2:14:24] <peanutdot007> @PhantomMiG Probably to keep atmosphere out of the ship
[2:14:26] <%hrbeck_> ME made autism a superpower, I doubt they would have done "dealing with anxiety after trauma" well
[2:14:27] <%maenos2> flirt
[2:14:28] <+trackles_64> stop flirting
[2:14:28] <%CalderGaming> yyyyup
[2:14:32] <tanarath> Honestly, air is a structural weakness
[2:14:33] <%Mattais88> It is
[2:14:33] <medoodoo> doing the what?
[2:14:34] <%RetroCop87> STOP FLIRTING YOU NORMIE FUCKS
[2:14:36] <%xcompleasedad> GETH SHOTGUN?????
[2:14:38] <Sp3ctre48> you are correct
[2:14:39] <%AmericanSkidd> Their attempts at flirting are so adorably bad
[2:14:40] <%DrTomT18> yes
[2:14:40] <%peachy996> Flirt in front Liara
[2:14:41] <+cermo55> yup, ididn't get this tone
[2:14:41] <%RealThiele> guide me in Tali
[2:14:42] <%xcompleasedad> Dammit

[2:15:22] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I love her
[2:15:22] <studleydoorite> are there any Geth you can kiss?
[2:15:29] <@QueequegTheater> @studleydoorite Legion
[2:15:30] <%jillyrancher> iirc there's a character who says that gun could be considered a war crime
[2:15:34] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> @hraezlyrnoyaiba I know right!
[2:15:35] <%RealThiele> Liara has internal biotics i guess that keep her alive in space mostly
[2:15:46] <+trackles_64> the alarm mad eme think there was a fire
[2:15:46] <%InternetShis> Wait does it remember who did what at the Suicide Mission?
[2:15:52] <%AmericanSkidd> geth dont buy stuff
[2:15:52] <%Conscript_Gary> I think Salarians use UV lasers too
[2:15:53] <$Futurecity10> Liara literally seething during this mission
[2:15:53] <%DrTomT18> don't worry about it
[2:15:56] <Alzero83> Show off your Dodge roll for Tali
[2:15:58] <%SpcOpsBear> Someone smart explain how UV lasers are btter than IF lasers
[2:16:00] <%jillyrancher> Geth don't care about moneyz
[2:16:00] <+GuilKato> upgrade your lasers!
[2:16:01] <secret_npc> Are you Pat?
[2:16:05] <Madinki> @hraezlyrnoyaiba WAIT YEAH WTF?!
[2:16:11] <peanutdot007> @studleydoorite I don't think they're Fully Functional and Anatomically Correct
[2:16:13] <%jillyrancher> I love the contrast of blue and red
[2:16:14] <%tamale_senpai> @hraezlyrnoyaiba Liar has Barriers, mask is just for oxygen
[2:16:14] <Dunmarkh> fleshlight heads
[2:16:15] <LightningLynx89> Murder the Flashlights
[2:16:23] <knotsundownsyndrome> @SpcOpsBear infrared is a lower freq than UV on the electromagnetic spectrum
[2:16:24] <%cooldude69xx> @SpcOpsBear Higher frequencies are faster
[2:16:26] <%JamesCorck> Oh no it's a bunch of Ikea lamps!
[2:16:26] <$hattrick61> smash these clankers
[2:16:27] <%watts121> @hraezlyrnoyaiba biotics are able to create barriers
[2:16:29] <@Ranryu692> It only remembers if you send Tali into the vents and if you choose Jack for the biotic bubble
[2:16:32] <+GuilKato> has liara got her ammo power on?
[2:16:33] <akitanito> why would they use heavy ordnance in their own ship
[2:16:34] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Why does robotic life have an atmosphere. With any gases
[2:16:38] <Parapattern> That's just a biotic rocket launcher
[2:16:43] <cpt_langosta> turn those flashlight heads into fleshlight heads oh god why did i even say that
[2:16:45] <+dd44dostivei> shouldn't they recognize the normandy crew?
[2:16:45] <%Ghufufin> turbolasers are the fastest
[2:16:46] <RyuuAoi> I need one of those ass pillows top, Pat.
[2:16:47] <%RealThiele> this mission is just pat and paige goto IKEA
[2:16:51] <%InternetShis> And if you Pull, I bet it makes a HUGE nuke
[2:16:53] <%AmericanSkidd> wtf
[2:16:55] <studleydoorite> @studleydoorite if people can kiss and fall in love with roller coasters, that doesn't matter
[2:16:59] <%cooldude69xx> Gun broke?
[2:17:03] <%peachy996> Are you whiffing?
[2:17:03] <%Conscript_Gary> Atmosphere is useful for cooling systems
[2:17:11] <%SvenHolgersson> SvenHolgersson subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 21 month streak! Yo did your Shepard get that Qussy yet? Much love to you and yours
[2:17:11] <BlackStarAura> Roll into the Geth landmines lol
[2:17:11] <%alphonseisbest> man that Gun seems shit Pat
[2:17:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> "I don't hear an alarm" Did you forget the no windows conversation, Shepard?
[2:17:15] <%maenos2> @phantommig there isn't atmosphere it's why they're all wearing helmets or masks
[2:17:20] <%jillyrancher> Fire can exist without oxygen
[2:17:22] <%AmericanSkidd> firing blanks?
[2:17:25] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Man I gotta do an Adept playthrough of ME1-3
[2:17:30] <terrible35> cant vent heat in a vacuum very well
[2:17:36] <%ZephynM> A magic man with magic hands?
[2:17:42] <LLCoolZJ> Doesn't Liara's other outfit have a helmet whe nshe needs it?
[2:17:42] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> @watts121 I guess she better not get knocked out in space then.
[2:17:48] <RyuuAoi> Is Pat doing it terribly?
[2:17:48] <quipquest1> It's okay, They don't feel pain
[2:17:48] <%ahomeschooldropout> Engineer is a highly underrated class
[2:17:50] <$hattrick61> shep forgot to put an ammo block in
[2:17:50] <+GuilKato> Seduce the geth platforms its the only way to win!
[2:17:52] <%hrbeck_> the qussy is gonna be so ready after this
[2:17:55] <%SpcOpsBear> UHH DID LIARA JUST KNEE-SLIDE
[2:18:03] <%InternetShis> BIG Explosion
[2:18:06] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Look at the heatwave on the vents lol. Ship is hot AF
[2:18:09] <haisho> geth rockets giving me PTSD
[2:18:15] <%Saffry_Ruzin> The Geth are extra curvy in ME LE actually
[2:18:16] <Sp3ctre48> Game be like: "Remember how geth work???"
[2:18:16] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> @ahomeschooldropout I like Engineer but the holo drones and such designs tilt me from using it
[2:18:30] <%AmericanSkidd> its just running hot
[2:18:31] <%PhantomMiG> @maenos2 Issue is there is steam and noise from vetting something that would not happen in an atmosphere
[2:18:31] <Profmcstevie> They love sci-fi colours
[2:18:32] <cpt_langosta> geth are all about aesthetics
[2:18:32] <LightningLynx89> Like every movie poster from the 2010s
[2:18:33] <%tamale_senpai> Sentinel in ME3 is basicly battle mage
[2:18:36] <Sp3ctre48> LUL
[2:18:36] <%RealThiele> Geth Vacuum cooled spaceships
[2:18:36] <djblue_shift> teal?
[2:18:37] <%InternetShis> Pull into Flare is basically a Megaflare
[2:18:37] <$lotharrio> Geth are designing posters most of the time.
[2:18:38] <Aoworth> They're big fans of Portal
[2:18:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE in this era of games
[2:18:42] <+TheFlyingChurro> Pat that's not a color scheme that's superheated metal
[2:18:46] <%JamesCorck> They decorate their rooms with early 2000's movie posters.
[2:18:47] <digaogrunge> mine
[2:18:49] <%jillyrancher> @sp3ctre48 It needs to inform the dummies who started with this game
[2:18:50] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Like very movie post from 2010 to 2019
[2:18:52] <%demiiluna> It definitely doesn't look different from the Geth ship in ME2
[2:18:56] <+GuilKato> so thats why their spaceships have some air in them - to make the heatsinks work better
[2:19:04] <%cooldude69xx> @ahomeschooldropout Its like a cleric in DnD. If youre smart its clearly useful, but if you're cool its clearly boring
[2:19:10] <%SpcOpsBear> Sentinel is just an armored mage. Fight me.
[2:19:21] <%MrWurmles> Geth may not appreciate athsethics, but at least they know color theory and how to use complementary colors.
[2:19:27] <%jillyrancher> Yo this level has such a cool combat section
[2:19:32] <%RealThiele> oops all indoctrinated
[2:19:33] <akitanito> stop flirting shep
[2:19:43] <Admiral_PopnFresh> about that
[2:19:43] <%AmericanSkidd> Every Time
[2:19:45] <+trackles_64> Quarians suck
[2:19:45] <%AllenDeadman> yeah
[2:19:48] <+Goraka91> In self defence right? Right?
[2:19:52] <Blackleafx> Quarians did everything wrong
[2:19:52] <Psyramics> yes, the Quarians are the cause of all of their problems
[2:19:52] <Profmcstevie> and now they're getting bopped
[2:19:56] <tanarath> Quarians legit committing suicide
[2:19:56] <LightningLynx89> Quarians > Geth
[2:19:57] <secret_npc> Yeah cause the Geth are a mistake
[2:20:01] <%DoubleRrico> literally frothing to kill the geth
[2:20:02] <%hrbeck_> Quarians suck
[2:20:08] <%cooldude69xx> I really cant stand the hard turn to paint the quarians as villains in ME 2
[2:20:09] <Sp3ctre48> This stupid conflict had to start somehow
[2:20:09] <murdocismyhero> NERDS!!!!
[2:20:10] <%DrTomT18> legion was right about everything
[2:20:11] <DatAsuna> that rifle is pretty disappointing
[2:20:12] <LightningLynx89> @secret_npc Mah man
[2:20:17] <%Piemono> I mean Quarian Victory basically leads to Genocide
[2:20:17] <Psyramics> Quarians literally cannot stop shooting themselves in the foot at every opportunity
[2:20:25] <+miguelrod777> I thought he was gonna say fuck
[2:20:27] <Sp3ctre48> Hunters suuuuuck in this game
[2:20:29] <+Soliloquy123> Wait, the *command center* has less fault-checks than a random hallway terminal?
[2:20:33] <%InternetShis> @secret_npc  Dangerously based
[2:20:36] <%RealThiele> Geth need to invest in some acid that boils organics away
[2:20:39] <haisho> You could place as one of those in MP
[2:20:39] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Infiltrator is such a cool class imo
[2:20:40] <+trackles_64> so broken
[2:20:45] <haisho> err play
[2:20:46] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Best MP class right There, Geth Hunters rekt shit
[2:21:06] <%PhantomMiG> @guilkato Atmosphere is a poor thermal conductor literally anything is better as an industrial perspective
[2:21:10] <%cooldude69xx> @Saffry_Ruzin Til they got nerfed.
[2:21:14] <Parapattern> Literally every ME race has, is currently, or is planning on committing genocide
[2:21:16] <+trackles_64> Why do geth even need a ui interface?
[2:21:19] <jorniev> WAIT you can play geth on MP ? COOOL
[2:21:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Geth have Operations Centers?
[2:21:26] <Aiutare47> Pat refuses to look at the story
[2:21:41] <Sp3ctre48> @cooldude69xx I think ME2 at least kept it reasonably in the middle since they were villains all throughout ME1, but this game really skews way too hard into turning the Geth into blameless victims and that sucks
[2:21:43] <cpt_langosta> i hope it's not a 9 volt...
[2:21:44] <%AmericanSkidd> Geth Prime was almost unkillable
[2:21:50] <%cooldude69xx> @jorniev Geth, Vorcha, Krogan with hammers, the list goes on
[2:21:52] <%Saffry_Ruzin> @jorniev You could play everything except a Hanar and Elcor
[2:21:57] <RushUnplugged> engineer, the best class according to 100% of the engineer cult that wants everybody to play engineer. everyone else is having fun in the meantime
[2:22:01] <%strakillias> He must be exhausted
[2:22:09] <jorniev> WAIT VORCHA!?
[2:22:19] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Venting? crumpSussy
[2:22:21] <+Prism_Zet> pew pew space
[2:22:23] <%InternetShis> Tali is the best because she doesn't say Chube
[2:22:25] <jorniev> AND WHAT LIKE VOLUS TOO?
[2:22:28] <%MugenSandan> Does this make Legion a better Hugh
[2:22:33] <+trackles_64> heal
[2:22:36] <+Goraka91> @jorniev With a flamethrower
[2:22:37] <%Saffry_Ruzin> @jorniev Volus especially
[2:22:40] <Sp3ctre48> You can basically play as every race besides Hanar and Elcor in ME3's multiplayer
[2:22:40] <%TheGreatSkenardo> TheGreatSkenardo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months, currently on a 43 month streak! In the future- waist-high walls are the sole survivor of the alien diaspora
[2:22:45] <Make_me_mad> My favorite thing about Me3 is that the Vorcha are just tanking the Reaper invasion and the Reaper's don't really know what to do about it yet.
[2:23:06] <%cooldude69xx> @jorniev Two different Volus were playable. You couldnt take cover because you were short, it was great
[2:23:15] <%Saffry_Ruzin> @jorniev Awakened Collector was also a playable Character
[2:23:16] <%SpcOpsBear> >I will never use Heavy Melee
[2:23:18] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Shining Finger!
[2:23:22] <SaltyAzteca> blussy down
[2:23:30] <%xcompleasedad> @jorniev A race of Oddbjobs????
[2:23:31] <haisho> Liara got bopped by a Hunter
[2:23:34] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Tali can take a punch
[2:23:35] <%InternetShis> Pathetic
[2:23:37] <%jillyrancher> Smack that blue ass
[2:23:37] <%peachy996> You can basically play as this Geth unit in the MP
[2:23:38] <%strakillias> Dock that Asari a days pay for sleepin on the job
[2:23:40] <%AmericanSkidd> oh boy
[2:23:55] <+GuilKato> I thought you li\ked it when liara lay down on the job -the job is the name for shepard's
[2:23:58] <jorniev> @Saffry_Ruzin wow
[2:24:02] <Sp3ctre48> Watching Hunters and rocket troopers stunlocking vanguards to death was always really funny
[2:24:06] <+Goraka91> Is that why you tried to kill them all, Tali?
[2:24:12] <+GuilKato> well we could copy your mind into the computer
[2:24:12] <%Fooguwu> if only they could integrate into an immune system
[2:24:12] <Blackleafx> Kappa
[2:24:13] <Parapattern> LUL
[2:24:13] <quipquest1> Tali doesn't like Snythesis ending
[2:24:14] <Aiutare47> Poor Liara
[2:24:15] <%Saffry_Ruzin> @jorniev Geth Juggernaut was playable, and they were tall and nearly unkillable
[2:24:15] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I wish they went more into cybernetics in this universe
[2:24:17] <GustauveVIII> OH GOD
[2:24:18] <%cvp5127> jesus

[2:25:51] <%AllenDeadman> because as everything the Quarian's do, it's their own fucking fault
[2:25:53] <%Treuan> It's hard to tell with robots
[2:25:54] <%SpcOpsBear> @NeonLight Yep! Same voice actress. I think she's also in Marvel's Eternals, too.
[2:25:54] <%JamesCorck> -_-
[2:25:55] <%InternetShis> This part is real cool
[2:25:58] <%jillyrancher> Great section KonCha
[2:26:01] <%AmericanSkidd> thats a D battery at least
[2:26:01] <secret_npc> If you love hating Quarians, Pat, you'll love this mission
[2:26:01] <%AmuserName> dubstep guns
[2:26:02] <%Conscript_Gary> This segment is super cool
[2:26:03] <%JamesCorck> Pat, did you think it was the power source of the ship?
[2:26:07] <%strakillias> That shockwave takes out your shield if not in cover btw
[2:26:11] <Minorou> Tali knows a lot about Shepard's big gun
[2:26:12] <cpt_langosta> for some reason, waist-high cover protects you from the ship's primary cannon's shockwave
[2:26:12] <%cooldude69xx> @DoubleRrico No because Gerrel is a lunatic
[2:26:19] <haisho> god I hate rocket troopers so much
[2:26:21] <%watts121> When is Pat gonna get a better shotgun?
[2:26:26] <+GuilKato> "Oh I'm sorry Liara, I'm just too much of a blabbermouth! about all the sex that Shepard and Tali had, just so much sex! on the Illusive Man's spy cameras!" - Edi
[2:26:34] <%AmericanSkidd> enemies, everywhere

[2:26:45] <%jillyrancher> GO GO GO
[2:26:45] <%ZephynM> yikes
[2:26:46] <GustauveVIII> remember to heavy melee when fist icon appears while in cover
[2:26:49] <%hairtoday> you got beaten to death with a rocket launcher
[2:26:49] <Srthunda> you didnt go hard enough pat
[2:26:52] <coracor> biotic charge has failed us
[2:26:52] <%jillyrancher> I WILL DESTROY YOU
[2:26:53] <%RealThiele> b o n k
[2:26:53] <tanarath> hhmmm
[2:26:54] <Aiutare47> this part is the antithesis of vangards really
[2:26:55] <%InternetShis> This part is anti Vanguard
[2:26:55] <%MelBrooksKA> Just keep face fucking the rockets
[2:26:57] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> "Yo Liara I got this shit on BluRay if you wanna check it out later"
[2:26:58] <%kujofire990> a geth punched you to death lol
[2:27:00] <%PhantomMiG> Yeah this level is a pain
[2:27:02] <%cooldude69xx> @Sp3ctre48 VS virgin vanguard
[2:27:10] <mr_saturday93> Shep literally said it out loud pat
[2:27:11] <RyuuAoi> And now we know.
[2:27:22] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Rocket Trooper was also kinda playable in MP, but he got a flamethrower instead
[2:27:27] <cpt_langosta> you really like those missiles, huh?
[2:27:28] <tanarath> Maximum unga or stay in cover
[2:27:30] <Madinki> @GuilKato "Did you know Tali let Shepard do her butt? You never did that Liara."
[2:27:31] <mr_saturday93> rocket to thr face
[2:27:31] <%jillyrancher> I fucking love the cannon noise
[2:27:34] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> God I hate locking on
[2:27:35] <%jillyrancher> BWAAAAAAA
[2:27:50] <+PenmanLupine> Nova would work pretty well here
[2:27:51] <%ZephynM> It's real convenient when these guys stay out of cover.
[2:27:57] <%AllenDeadman> so... Quarians are just really stupid huh
[2:27:58] <zhenthrim213> ACTUION DODGE
[2:27:59] <%cooldude69xx> @Saffry_Ruzin And the other two powers buffed the flamethrower if I remember right
[2:28:08] <%AllenDeadman> how many times do they have to put themselves on a losing battle?
[2:28:20] <Sp3ctre48> Geth classes were super OP but their UI was like incredibly hard to look at
[2:28:25] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> My son, my son, what have you done?
[2:28:27] <%DashXero> Man... This is a lotta dead robots.
[2:28:28] <%cooldude69xx> @GuilKato "She wore the bunny ears Liara"
[2:28:32] <%Saffry_Ruzin> @cooldude69xx I never got them, but people would run around and melt shit with the flamethrower
[2:28:56] <%cooldude69xx> @Sp3ctre48 And squishy AF. Then the juggernaut
[2:28:58] <%The_Protagonist> i really miss the multiplayer in this. had an insane amount of fun with friends in it
[2:28:59] <%SpcOpsBear> i-framed
[2:29:07] <+hielotauro> nice invlun
[2:29:08] <%cooldude69xx> @Saffry_Ruzin Can confirm, I was one of them
[2:29:08] <$lotharrio> Heavy melee, oh no!
[2:29:11] <Madinki> @GuilKato "AND the reverse bunny suit. You only wore the regular one."
[2:29:15] <%Conscript_Gary> Thank god the vanguard charge has i-frames
[2:29:29] <%jillyrancher> Remember how Tali says in ME1 when the Geth gained self awareness and pretty much became slaves, the Quarians decided they needed to be taken to the yard and shot and instead of freed lol
[2:29:31] <%Deft_Thought> Is Twitch acting weird as hell for anybody? I'm getting a bunch of reset settings every time I load it up
[2:29:40] <intestinal_bleeding> SCIENCE BUTTON
[2:29:45] <dekkitout> @GuilKato "And this one time, Shepard told her about an old Earth tradition called 'Mardis Gras' Beads were involved. Many beads."
[2:29:47] <%AmericanSkidd> @GuilKato wait is that just arms and legs and a collar?
[2:29:57] <+trackles_64> ummm remote activation?
[2:30:03] <+GuilKato> @Madinki "would you like to see the video Liara? I have it saved!"

[2:31:58] <peanutdot007> These Geth must have eaten your cheerios to
[2:31:58] <Madinki> @GuilKato Yes it is just that. Looks weird from the back
[2:31:59] <DatAsuna> charge can be buggy like that
[2:31:59] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Yeah this area is buggy, take it nice and slow
[2:32:01] <Tracazoid> They found the dolphin counter
[2:32:02] <%sunsetdisc0> thats happened to me too
[2:32:03] <%Conscript_Gary> I saw it
[2:32:04] <%deviljhojho_> i wasnt paying attention
[2:32:06] <%AllenDeadman> god forbid you actually have to play the game
[2:32:07] <%InternetShis> Then stop
[2:32:08] <mikeriffic> shoot your gun then see if it fixes
[2:32:09] <Sp3ctre48> idk what happened there though, that was weird
[2:32:10] <@Spydurman> I'm just seeing a lot of salt
[2:32:15] <+Bail_Seven> this lvl is bad for the charge, something to do with floor
[2:32:15] <%alphonseisbest> yea Happened to me too
[2:32:15] <%cooldude69xx> This is what you got the pistol for Pat
[2:32:16] <Virokwet> yeah, but use cover tho
[2:32:16] <%Conscript_Gary> the geth hacked your controls
[2:32:16] <mr_saturday93> he has a fast cool down so he should be popping it every 2 secs
[2:32:18] <$hattrick61> just use the wheel

[2:32:26] <bleugh> pasta rat
[2:32:26] <secret_npc> Or maybe Charge is just buggy

[2:32:49] <DatAsuna> Charge is very cool but also not the most reliable
[2:32:49] <ToneBacas> floor must be very thin so you just clip through it
[2:32:50] <%watts121> I mean you did pick the meme class
[2:32:53] <%deviljhojho_> the price to pay for being literally the coolest class in the game
[2:33:00] <%jillyrancher> Charge is just a buggy ability
[2:33:00] <%cooldude69xx> Pretty sure its mostly user error

[2:33:56] <Admiral_PopnFresh> If only Hot Bird Man was here
[2:33:57] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Ironically, James is actually pretty good here because he's basically just a big wall of HP

[2:35:20] <%SirGO0SE> are ya winning son
[2:35:22] <mikeriffic> Just dont charge
[2:35:22] <RyuuAoi> Boss corridor
[2:35:23] <+Baileymiab> maybe use more gun instead of abilities
[2:35:25] <mikeriffic> pew pew more
[2:35:25] <@QueequegTheater> Whoa
[2:35:26] <ToneBacas> HA
[2:35:27] <%InternetShis> Stop vanguarding I guess
[2:35:31] <Chaos_Aether> than stop
[2:35:32] <@QueequegTheater> That's ridiculous
[2:35:33] <mr_saturday93> just use R2 pat
[2:35:33] <secret_npc> Maybe these Geth SHOULD be nuked
[2:35:34] <%jillyrancher> Just stay in cover for this part
[2:35:34] <%deviljhojho_> I SAW IT
[2:35:34] <%maenos2> take your time
[2:35:34] <Tracazoid> Use the power of gun
[2:35:37] <stormhawk9891> Stop facetanking missles
[2:35:38] <%Solid_Stro> shotoCry
[2:35:38] <intestinal_bleeding> yeah that's some silly goof
[2:35:39] <Brandon__Brando> @Baileymiab its a shot gunf
[2:35:40] <@Spydurman> oh wow he's still here lol
[2:35:41] <%peachy996> the game is getting its revenge on you
[2:35:41] <+Bail_Seven> PATS RIGHT, for once
[2:35:41] <+Baileymiab> literally just don't charge
[2:35:41] <lloyddboy> CHEESE IT PAT
[2:35:43] <ToneBacas> Liara tanked that shit
[2:35:43] <+ALazo> mash harder
[2:35:44] <DatAsuna> One reason why the female turian vanguard is actually amazing in MP is: She can charge without a target, even through walls
[2:35:44] <%Eaglestrike117> Pat
[2:35:44] <thewhiterice92> don't you have other abilities
[2:35:45] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt Do you have a secondary weapon you can use from more of a distance?
[2:35:45] <%cooldude69xx> I mean, you could use the pistol from far away?
[2:35:46] <%HotSauceFiend> restart maybe
[2:35:46] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Maybe its just ground floor and not top floor?
[2:35:46] <%stantheman_97> this seems like an anti-vanguard section
[2:35:46] <RyuuAoi> @internetshis Yeah that
[2:35:47] <%AmuserName> Damn, that's really bad.
[2:35:48] <%Eaglestrike117> use YOUR GUN
[2:35:48] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpSetIn NotLikeThis sbfpSetIn LUL
[2:35:49] <Chaos_Aether> use gun
[2:35:49] <ToneBacas> or Tali even
[2:35:50] <BurdRightsActivist> CMON DUDE I WAS BLOCKING THAT ACK ACK ACK
[2:35:50] <%Deft_Thought> Fun game
[2:35:50] <%SirGO0SE> LUL she ate that
[2:35:50] <tanarath> Use your pistol
[2:35:51] <terrible35> i dont remember it being nearly this busted
[2:35:52] <dekkitout> I remember the time I got my ass kicked by a hallway
[2:35:53] <@QueequegTheater> Holy shit, that's bad
[2:35:53] <%alphonseisbest> @wizard_of_diamonds WUT are u 5? the game is being buggy, not the classes
[2:35:53] <%demiiluna> Thin out the herd with Pulls first.
[2:35:53] <+Baileymiab> he has a pistol
[2:35:55] <$hattrick61> quit doing the thing that worked for a game and a half
[2:35:55] <%The_Protagonist> lmao Tali just ate that missle
[2:35:56] <DatAsuna> so her charge never bugs out lol
[2:35:56] <Dunmarkh> Pretend?
[2:35:59] <%jtdobyns> couuld be the battery thing when toches you temp stuns
[2:35:59] <%RealThiele> Table salt is one of the most common household chemicals. Table salt is 97% to 99% sodium chloride, NaCl. Pure sodium chloride is an ionic crystal solid. However, other compounds are present in table salt, depending on its source or additives that may be included before packaging. In its pure form, sodium chloride is white. Table salt may be white or may have a faint purple or blue tinge from impurities. Sea salt may be dull brown or gray.
[2:35:59] <%watts121> now you're a real soldier!
[2:35:59] <+CyanDeadEye> You a soldier now
[2:36:01] <%deviljhojho_> Hmmm, was this in the original?
[2:36:02] <digaogrunge> sooo... how bout pistol and flare then?
[2:36:02] <%jillyrancher> just snipe with your pistol
[2:36:03] <intestinal_bleeding> i mean I'd agree about not charging but it's about the ability not working outright, not about his preferred playstyle
[2:36:05] <Virokwet> walking into rockets will do that
[2:36:11] <%InternetShis> COVER SHOOTER TIME
[2:36:12] <SaltyAzteca> SOLDIER CLASS BEST CLASS
[2:36:12] <Dunmarkh> You don't need to pretend, you just don't have it
[2:36:12] <%Solid_Stro> You have no power here, Charge man!
[2:36:12] <%demiiluna> You need to scatter them with your biotics first
[2:36:19] <%crassletter> u still have flare and pull
[2:36:20] <BlackStarAura> HAHAHAHA
[2:36:21] <haisho> Yeah that's how Vanguard in MP usually ends up...
[2:36:24] <%maenos2> easy mode is now selectable
[2:36:25] <DatAsuna> @hattrick61 except for a bunch of fights in ME2 that had the same bug or enemies out of world
[2:36:26] <RyuuAoi> Play it like COD campaign, Pat.
[2:36:29] <@QueequegTheater> @demiiluna His biotics aren't working
[2:36:29] <intestinal_bleeding> normally i'd also be like "maybe adjust your strat" but if the game fu nction is like "naw it no work" I can definitely understand the frustration :)
[2:36:36] <lloyddboy> Time to play the game as intended Kappa
[2:36:38] <DatAsuna> unreliable is the word for it
[2:36:39] <%The_Protagonist> lol at people in the chat getting annoyed at you for expecting the game to work
[2:36:42] <%Agami23> its like this game is a buggy unfinished mess
[2:36:42] <LightningLynx89> You have Flare and Pull
[2:36:43] <Sp3ctre48> Can't even be snarky about it when the charge is actually not working as intended
[2:36:45] <cpt_langosta> the geth hacked your biotic implant... or something, idk
[2:36:47] <Minorou> does this make vanguard the dragoon of mass effect
[2:36:50] <%demiiluna> oh what
[2:36:53] <dekkitout> @RealThiele You had me at "faint purple or blue tinge" SeriousSloth
[2:36:54] <ToneBacas> the cover shooter it was always intended to be
[2:36:54] <intestinal_bleeding> me3 multiplayer demosection
[2:36:55] <Parapattern> The game doesn't want you to play the non-boring way
[2:37:00] <+JustToWatch> lol Tripwire CEO just got fired
[2:37:00] <Madinki> VANGARD IS SOOOOO FUCKING GREAT HUH?! THE MEME CLASS
[2:37:01] <%AllenDeadman> the holes are starting to show more and more
[2:37:02] <%DracosMagala> I dont have problem in this missiom
[2:37:02] <%Solid_Stro> The Geth have anti-Charge technology
[2:37:09] <%AmericanSkidd> got a checkpoint
[2:37:12] <%AmuserName> yep, that's a bullshit bug that you shouldn't have to be enduring.
[2:37:14] <%demiiluna> @QueequegTheater liar it worked just now >:(
[2:37:20] <%deviljhojho_> vanguard is still better than every other class lol
[2:37:23] <%CapnBeefs> So many fucking rockets
[2:37:27] <%deviljhojho_> keep coping
[2:37:27] <macathelo> that energy fild don't block yur powers?
[2:37:27] <%jillyrancher> Try charging now
[2:37:27] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Pull into Flare is a strat
[2:37:29] <@Ranryu692> @deviljhojho_ it's not
[2:37:31] <%peachy996> God I forgot how much this corridor sucked
[2:37:38] <%deviljhojho_> @Ranryu692 wrong
[2:37:47] <%alphonseisbest> @deviljhojho_ it totally is tho
[2:37:48] <%valriot> how do i shot web
[2:37:49] <haisho> this is like 1/5 of how many fucking rockets you'd run into in MP
[2:37:50] <secret_npc> Chat, how is Vanguard in the Earth mission?
[2:37:51] <haisho> it was the worst
[2:37:51] <%crassletter> for being a remaster it sure seems the left a lot of old bugs
[2:37:55] <%DracosMagala> He getting the taste of Gold rank in MP
[2:37:55] <%strakillias> ewww, without charge it becomes a cover shooter
[2:37:59] <%SpcOpsBear> Not that we can see how much ammo you even have...
[2:38:00] <%deviljhojho_> @alphonseisbest right
[2:38:03] <GustauveVIII> This place is probably one of the only places in the game where I used shockwave.
[2:38:05] <%peachy996> @secret_npc it's fine.
[2:38:08] <Sp3ctre48> Infiltrators are always the best classes tbh
[2:38:09] <@Ranryu692> @deviljhojho_ it's better than soldier, I guess
[2:38:14] <+FingaLights> shoot bang no go boom boom
[2:38:20] <%AmericanSkidd> you won
[2:38:20] <%alphonseisbest> @deviljhojho_ thank you
[2:38:22] <LightningLynx89> Just play Soldier Kappa
[2:38:23] <Parapattern> Game says no fun for now
[2:38:25] <%Solid_Stro> The suffering has ended
[2:38:26] <%watts121> Infiltrators>Every Other Class
[2:38:26] <%deviljhojho_> @Ranryu692 i mean everything is a notch above soldier
[2:38:31] <%cooldude69xx> I admit I stopped charging after a point here, but that was because I charged into five geth, died, and stuck with the party after
[2:38:34] <%deviljhojho_> like who even picks soldier lol
[2:38:35] <%CalderGaming> your complaint is valid. just gotta safety strat though it i guess
[2:38:36] <%alphonseisbest> @deviljhojho_ i mean thats just every other class LUL
[2:38:36] <%Conscript_Gary> FPS Elevator segment! time!
[2:38:38] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Hey chat does ME2 still have class locked weapons?
[2:38:40] <intestinal_bleeding> geth money
[2:38:42] <%deviljhojho_> i dont want to be El Generico
[2:38:43] <secret_npc> Soldier is ironically the OP class
[2:38:44] <$hattrick61> setinal to become a walking tank
[2:38:44] <DatAsuna> @GustauveVIII shockwave is one of those classes where it's pretty much only good at rank 6 or not at all lol
[2:38:45] <%peachy996> Soldier is better than Engineer
[2:38:48] <+GuilKato> its nice that the geth still use standard doors considering they're manufacturing everything themselves not buying it
[2:38:50] <%AllenDeadman> the clasic cover shooter experience
[2:38:52] <RyuuAoi> Pacing. Filler arch.
[2:38:54] <haisho> yeah that's how Vanguard ended up in MP too
[2:38:54] <GustauveVIII> Soldier is literally the most played class in mass effect
[2:38:55] <intestinal_bleeding> what do geth even spend money on, geth strippers?
[2:38:56] <%peachy996> Engies suck
[2:38:58] <%tamale_senpai> Sentinel Fucks in this game, jack of all trades
[2:38:59] <GustauveVIII> and imo, the most boring
[2:39:03] <cpt_langosta> time for buggy sequence
[2:39:07] <%DoubleRrico> Paragon Shepard being an assassin class would be so weird
[2:39:12] <%logoth_> oopsie
[2:39:15] <%jillyrancher> ofcourse it's the most boring
[2:39:16] <%RealThiele> elevator battle!
[2:39:21] <@Ranryu692> what was the point of making you run for .5 seconds?
[2:39:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @JustAnotherTrapArtist yea but you have the choice partway through to unlock one more weapon type or a stronger weapon you can already use
[2:39:33] <secret_npc> Solider is fun af tho
[2:39:37] <%logoth_> Liara must be stewing with rage
[2:39:37] <%AmericanSkidd> LUL
[2:39:38] <%walternatorz> couldn't you use your biotics to float over there? or liara use hers?
[2:39:38] <ape_hawk> tali's totally pegging you tonight
[2:39:40] <%Conscript_Gary> Ah yes, the random pile of guns in the collector ship
[2:39:45] <%deviljhojho_> "i shoot it with my gun"
[2:39:45] <akitanito> liara so salty she's not speaking
[2:39:46] <%deviljhojho_> wow
[2:39:47] <%hairtoday> liara dry heaving in the background
[2:39:50] <SaltyAzteca> SULK
[2:39:51] <Psyramics> liara rolling her eyes are her ex flirts in front of her with another woman
[2:39:53] <Profmcstevie> You seething blueberry?
[2:39:57] <+ALazo> Liara will remember this
[2:39:57] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Ah so same as vanilla, that sucks
[2:40:00] <%logoth_> You ever hang out with a girl who rejected you and she brings her boyfriend along to hang out! IT SUCKS!
[2:40:02] <Dova573> poor Liara
[2:40:08] <medoodoo> sigh im so lowkey disappointed pat chose tali over liara sighhhh
[2:40:09] <%deviljhojho_> you cant just keep getting away with it
[2:40:10] <%InternetShis> She is too busy Coping and Seething
[2:40:11] <+Baileymiab> Liara disliked that
[2:40:12] <Madinki> She be coping and sheething
[2:40:17] <haisho> basic Solder in MP was basic ass BS but everything after that was REALLY fun

[2:41:26] <$lotharrio> @secret_npc I think Liara only says she'd be okay with that, because she knows Ashley wouldn't be okay with it. Tali might be open to the idea and that's not what Liara actually wants.
[2:41:28] <+Goraka91> Okay
[2:41:32] <%cooldude69xx> The geth are too pure for this world

[2:44:03] <RyuuAoi> Game over yeah
[2:44:05] <@Ranryu692> maybe either quit the game and reload, or plug in the controller?
[2:44:05] <%deviljhojho_> what a freak
[2:44:06] <Aiutare47> Siege pulse hits so hard it tabs you out
[2:44:06] <+Goraka91> UH

[2:44:19] <BlackStarAura> LOVE YOU PRIME
[2:44:22] <digaogrunge> Pats hands are ragequitting
[2:44:26] <mr_saturday93> NASAs revenge obviously
[2:44:27] <Ashrox117> Shot Shepard in the stack
[2:44:29] <%RealThiele> easy mode activated
[2:44:30] <haisho> man playing Juggernauts in MP was so cool
[2:44:31] <%AmericanSkidd> Garrel is a bastard fuck I punch him every time
[2:44:37] <%afronooch> god jank jonk is such a bop
[2:44:44] <%cooldude69xx> @secret_npc Of course
[2:45:14] <Sp3ctre48> @secret_npc I don't think there was a good option, but them joining with the galaxy destroying machines isn't exactly excusable either
[2:45:17] <%jillyrancher> no
[2:45:19] <$SGrim> @fugly_nick not yet
[2:45:29] <Sp3ctre48> not that I care to side with the Quarians on this
[2:45:31] <%cooldude69xx> @haisho Shout out to my juggernaut bros who stood in the way to get shot instead of me with my geth flamethrower
[2:45:48] <%tamale_senpai> MP feels like such a different game. No default ammo powers and tougher enemies
[2:46:15] <%cooldude69xx> @Sp3ctre48 The geth had literally no other options besides death.
[2:46:29] <secret_npc> I used to solo MP as chad Infiltrator
[2:46:30] <%tamale_senpai> Such a minor change, plus nerfed classes
[2:46:31] <%jillyrancher> "Just die tho lol"
[2:46:40] <Sp3ctre48> I don't think I played a single game where someone wasn't using a Juggernaut after they released that stupid class
[2:46:47] <%MegboyManuel> MegboyManuel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! hey Pat, been sick with probably-covid for 1 week straight, had like 6 days of fever and now I'm dealing with a ghastly cough. Time to become a super villain and coughing at all the food items in convenience stores. I will be doom
[2:46:59] <%AmericanSkidd> We were walking gods
[2:47:01] <%jillyrancher> dont do that
[2:47:05] <secret_npc> Good luck, Megboy
[2:47:09] <%SirGO0SE> just took a shower and put so much girl spa goo on me and i feel / smell incredible
[2:47:10] <%tamale_senpai> @secret_npc Oh yeah you could Solo!
[2:47:18] <haisho> well yeah Phantoms were fucking bullshit in MP and the ability to force-choke them was VERY cathartic
[2:47:19] <%jillyrancher> This is my Kingdom come
[2:47:29] <%jillyrancher> this is my kingdom come
[2:47:43] <%cooldude69xx> @Sp3ctre48 I saw an enjoyable number of Giant krogan get instantly killed by phantoms and banshees myself
[2:47:59] <%InternetShis> Tech Armor.
[2:48:17] <%tamale_senpai> Fucking Banshees in MP! tHE WORST!
[2:48:24] <Sp3ctre48> @Sp3ctre48 I'm not saying they had a choice in the matter, just that what they did trying to survive has consequences we can't just brush over
[2:48:27] <cpt_langosta> this picross puzzle turned out to be a scarf, but it looks more like an active volcano...
[2:48:29] <Shockmaster182> Ayo can we get some trans rights going in the chat
[2:48:36] <haisho> really? I think Phantoms are far worse
[2:48:36] <%Conscript_Gary> All those jokes about multiplayer in the Citadel DLC are just gonna fly completely over his head
[2:48:47] <haisho> though Collectors are a completely different level of bullshit
[2:48:55] <+SaphronBlackbourne> trans rights
[2:48:58] <Ashrox117> Being basically a Phantom as the N7 Fury was sick though
[2:49:07] <%jillyrancher> Pat would totally be the Vanguard who runs off from the objective
[2:49:07] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Then they added the redone Collector Faction in MP, they're also in the Citadel DLC through the Arena
[2:49:10] <%InternetShis> How is ME3 multiplayer gonna be implemented without gacha? XP/Credit unlocks in game?
[2:49:10] <%SirGO0SE> TransgenderPride
[2:49:12] <Sp3ctre48> The Collectors are the worst NotLikeThis
[2:49:23] <%tamale_senpai> @haisho I just remember having a lot of bad runs with them, Phantoms are up there though
[2:49:26] <haisho> I hope it's credit unlocks
[2:49:37] <$hattrick61> TransgenderPride TransgenderPride TransgenderPride
[2:49:59] <Sp3ctre48> There's no way they add it without the gacha
[2:50:08] <%InternetShis> Scions snuffStress
[2:50:14] <fugly_nick> Is Pat still using that weird eye glitch?
[2:50:15] <%deviljhojho_> its him
[2:50:22] <%Agami23> replace gacha with battlepass. thats what they'll do
[2:50:22] <haisho> you could run from Banshees real easy. Phantoms just shoot you in the ass really hard if they can't grab you
[2:50:23] <%tamale_senpai> Also once your guys get Max level you had to send them off to fight and start over
[2:50:24] <secret_npc> Chat press F if you have no friends irl
[2:50:25] <%InternetShis> He

[2:50:59] <peanutdot007> He just keeps getting bigger
[2:51:01] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> There's a cool mod where you can wear the N7 Fury armor which is mad
[2:51:08] <+NeonLight> :P

[2:51:25] <+Baileymiab> BLep boi
[2:51:26] <%deviljhojho_> his lungs are like a thundersturm
[2:51:28] <digaogrunge> he blep
[2:51:29] <+JustToWatch> I love him
[2:51:33] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I like the idea that there's people as skilled as shep but not as heroic or inspiring
[2:51:35] <%InternetShis> BIG BLEP
[2:51:36] <+Baileymiab> he so dang CUTE
[2:51:36] <%pupil31> :D

[2:51:42] <%SirGO0SE> aww he so happy!
[2:51:45] <%AmericanSkidd> he is a big potato of fat and love
[2:51:56] <%tamale_senpai> @haisho But a Banshee on your ass while having to hold a position was no bueno
[2:52:03] <+GuilKato> his pretend eyebrows are the best
[2:52:03] <%bravebravesrobin> done already?
[2:52:10] <%cooldude69xx> Multiplayer reapers were the easiest faction to fight IMO
[2:52:14] <%bravebravesrobin> oh nvm
[2:52:15] <%jillyrancher> Less gooooo
[2:52:17] <secret_npc> He gonna go sleep, dream of eating Pat
[2:52:17] <%captainpodock> Is he an Olde English r just regular English?
[2:52:22] <terrible35> i saw the slobber
[2:52:36] <%jillyrancher> TAKING CASUALTIES
[2:52:49] <akitanito> survive
[2:52:51] <%AmericanSkidd> getting shot
[2:52:55] <%Fooguwu> that's the sound of a healthy sleep schedule
[2:52:57] <Sp3ctre48> Reapers were the hardest on launch but they got powercreeped by how much the Geth got buffed and the Collectors in general
[2:53:00] <%jillyrancher> my German shepherd has eyebrows like that I love it in doggis
[2:53:01] <secret_npc> Imagine a Predator arm meme of Elmo and Gief wanting to eat Pat's corpse
[2:53:08] <haisho> fighting big angry Geth
[2:53:16] <%maenos2> maenos2 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! yay 18 months.  Wish I had something witty to say.  I always think of something good weeks later.  ah well.  Keep up the good works Pat man.

[2:53:27] <%logoth_> RAGGRRGHHH
[2:53:27] <%tamale_senpai> But now that I think bout it, I  always upgraded my Passive abilities last, that might have factored in

[2:54:00] <akitanito> jesus christ quarians
[2:54:01] <%cooldude69xx> @Sp3ctre48 Cerberus phantoms and turrets alone kept them plently threatening to me personally. Meanwhile, brutes were the easiest thing in the world
[2:54:04] <zhenthrim213> every time
[2:54:06] <Profmcstevie> GERREL I WILL KILL YOU
[2:54:10] <Sp3ctre48> hAHAHA I'm stupid XD
[2:54:14] <+critikal_bit> LITERALLY PROVING LEGION'S POINT
[2:54:17] <Ardailec> Loghain just can't stop stabbing people in the back
[2:54:18] <%maenos2> @gustauveviii wait wait he's voiced by loghain?!  oh god I hear it now.
[2:54:21] <+cermo55> Quarians never pass up a chance
[2:54:22] <%senfood> THE QUARIANS HAVE NO IDEA HOW LUCKY THEY ARE THEY THEY'RE HOT
[2:54:26] <ape_hawk> SNORT
[2:54:27] <ToneBacas> LUL Gief
[2:54:27] <akitanito> can you shoot gerrel in the face later
[2:54:27] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Damn you Kain
[2:54:30] <%AllenDeadman> why do we help these assholes again?
[2:54:32] <@Spydurman> THE GETH DID NOTHING WRONG
[2:54:32] <+xerotwo> RAAAAAAAAAAAGGHH
[2:54:34] <+miguelrod777> EVERYTIME
[2:54:35] <shallaska> did gief just snort into paige's mic LUL
[2:54:36] <%cooldude69xx> @maenos2 That really explains a lot
[2:54:36] <%peachy996> Smart Quarians are smrt
[2:54:37] <Profmcstevie> Gief snorting on mic
[2:54:38] <%InternetShis> Shnort
[2:54:41] <%MidnightBurst12> psaDogchamp
[2:54:43] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> Quarians making good decisions as always
[2:54:44] <%demiiluna> Wow Tali, your people are bad at this.
[2:54:45] <studleydoorite> are the people taking these orders hearing their higher ups bickering in real time about what to do?  that's pretty bad
[2:54:46] <zhenthrim213> its THE WIRES
[2:54:48] <lloyddboy> FLOOR STUCK
[2:54:50] <zhenthrim213> i think
[2:54:52] <%deviljhojho_> gonna hae to rough it
[2:54:53] <%logoth_> wtf is happening
[2:54:53] <zerointelligence000> i think the grated floors are a fuck
[2:54:55] <%InternetShis> Paige's mic is now Gief's mic
[2:54:55] <StaceMcGate> AAAARGH
[2:54:55] <+ThomasOfTroy> @PatStaresAt What button is charge set to? The controller might be getting duplicated inputs for some reason. Hitting X twice took you straight to "do you want to delete this save" and hitting B twice would choose to not delete the save and then immediately kick you out to the main menu
[2:54:57] <Minorou> the geth installed anti-vanguard floors
[2:55:00] <haisho> the wires are fucking with the pathing
[2:55:00] <secret_npc> Yeah Loghain and Morrigan are Quarian admirals
[2:55:01] <fugly_nick> You can't just solve every problem by Biotic Charging at them
[2:55:02] <%jillyrancher> @studleydoorite Probably
[2:55:02] <%AmericanSkidd> unga bunga ineffective against primes
[2:55:06] <SaltyAzteca> PLEASE. I BEG YOU
[2:55:10] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt didnt Legions mission in 2 have similiar problems?
[2:55:13] <%RealThiele> qussy down
[2:55:16] <Sp3ctre48> Funny how Gerrel and Koris completely switched places here
[2:55:23] <GustauveVIII> @ThomasOfTroy It's not the controller. It's this level. It did the same to me when I was using keyboard hotkeys.
[2:55:23] <secret_npc> Use party
[2:55:35] <%deviljhojho_> koris is a king tho
[2:55:37] <RushUnplugged> Geth racists against vanguards confirmed
[2:55:38] <metalsiren31> It's something about the level geometry
[2:55:39] <%AmericanSkidd> they have... anti biotics
[2:55:40] <%cooldude69xx> Geth Primes are resistant to caveman tactics
[2:55:40] <secret_npc> Geth hate Vanguards
[2:55:41] <$hattrick61> Gerral is literally holding himself and his entire fleet hostage. "if we die youre fucked so you better cover my suicide charge."
[2:55:45] <%captainpodock> Itsweird how Shep's yell kinda sounds like Pat's yell.
[2:55:49] <%Piemono> Geth Floors are meta-gaming
[2:55:50] <%InternetShis> Pat, Tali is Tali. Use her
[2:55:59] <%deviljhojho_> qwib qwib for life
[2:56:04] <%AmericanSkidd> 2
[2:56:04] <+DocReapoff> @Sp3ctre48 Secret is that they never did
[2:56:10] <akitanito> all of em
[2:56:11] <SaltyAzteca> Geez
[2:56:12] <+trackles_64> lots
[2:56:12] <%maenos2> well that's just prime
[2:56:12] <@QueequegTheater> A lot
[2:56:13] <%peachy996> as many needed to fuck your butt
[2:56:14] <Profmcstevie> Any Primes lytEYES
[2:56:19] <cpt_langosta> there must be 4 primes or nintendo lied
[2:56:19] <haisho> two, but that's enough to be a problem
[2:56:20] <+ThomasOfTroy> @ThomasOfTroy That super weird, but alright
[2:56:20] <secret_npc> USE PARTY
[2:56:23] <%deviljhojho_> wow
[2:56:24] <AthenaAegis> Enough to make you RIP Kappa
[2:56:25] <secret_npc> Tali has hacking
[2:56:28] <Ashrox117> 3, 7, 11, idj
[2:56:28] <%jillyrancher> Primes are tough
[2:56:30] <+trackles_64> every time
[2:56:30] <%bread_assassin> It can just be explained by geth hacking into Shepard's implants to fuck with him.
[2:56:31] <+Krecart> Energy Drain and Warp might help you out with those guys
[2:56:31] <Marpolo13> lol
[2:56:34] <+GuilKato> tali needs to use AI hacking more?
[2:56:35] <+Baileymiab> use tf outta tali and stay in cover
[2:56:35] <mr_saturday93> MORTIS
[2:56:37] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> Big boi geths strong
[2:56:37] <%tamale_senpai> Charge is weaker against everything other than bare health. Maybe more effective against barriers
[2:56:38] <notsoy> standing up and getting shot is a bold approach
[2:56:38] <%peachy996> Is that enough primes to fuck your butt?
[2:56:38] <%jillyrancher> This section is a bitch
[2:56:39] <PaperyHornet1013> hack with tali
[2:56:41] <%PhantomMiG> Should flare nuke the geth prime @patstaresat
[2:56:41] <RyuuAoi> Big damage
[2:56:41] <%InternetShis> Tali can hack
[2:56:42] <secret_npc> You have a team, Shepard
[2:56:43] <%deviljhojho_> just like the multiplayer
[2:56:48] <Profmcstevie> Vision blocked by the low health goo, my favourite design choice
[2:56:52] <%mads_valentine> Merryweather fleet's here bro!
[2:56:54] <djblue_shift> no sabotage?
[2:57:01] <%SpcOpsBear> @PatStaresAt Try using the Power Wheel if you start having issues with the power shortcuts
[2:57:02] <+PenmanLupine> its not that bad of a mission. Pats just being Pat
[2:57:03] <$hattrick61> no you aint
[2:57:04] <PaperyHornet1013> lol
[2:57:07] <Sp3ctre48> or not LUL
[2:57:08] <digaogrunge> USE TALI HACK
[2:57:11] <+xerotwo> FamilyMan OOP AHH!
[2:57:11] <Aiutare47> Siege pulse will do massive damage and the rockets will stagger, your best bet is to sabotage the fuck outta them
[2:57:13] <%InternetShis> Nah
[2:57:13] <biyatchboi> rolled
[2:57:13] <akitanito> geez
[2:57:15] <%cooldude69xx> The glitch would get in the way less if ally powers were in play
[2:57:16] <fugly_nick> You really gotta use Tali's powers
[2:57:17] <%Mr_Pylon> Pat having a big fun now
[2:57:18] <AthenaAegis> Oof
[2:57:20] <+ThomasOfTroy> Maybe lower the difficulty for this level
[2:57:22] <PaperyHornet1013> tali chan
[2:57:23] <+cermo55> hack the turrent
[2:57:24] <ape_hawk> watch out, thats a prime!
[2:57:25] <%AmericanSkidd> this is why we take garrus
[2:57:28] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Stay on the outer edge of the arena. Probably better...
[2:57:28] <+braincraft> Your Vanguard balls are too big.
[2:57:28] <+xerotwo> LUL
[2:57:30] <%mads_valentine> Have you tried shooting the gun?
[2:57:31] <Sp3ctre48> @PenmanLupine His charge is literally not working the way it's supposed to
[2:57:34] <%demiiluna> spam everyone's ranged powers
[2:57:36] <%deviljhojho_> try diplomacy
[2:57:39] <%jillyrancher> No dont lower you can do it
[2:57:40] <digaogrunge> SABOTAGE
[2:57:42] <+xerotwo> PHRASING LUL
[2:57:49] <%Mutsu2k> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:57:50] <%peachy996> Maybe bring a Garrus Turret next time
[2:57:50] <%deviljhojho_> hmmmm
[2:57:55] <fugly_nick> use the pause in the power wheel to plan things out
[2:58:08] <PaperyHornet1013> cat fight tho
[2:58:09] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You should've brought James
[2:58:11] <%deviljhojho_> we needed NTR memes tho
[2:58:13] <akitanito> but le cat fight
[2:58:13] <%RetroCop87> Garus is a cheat
[2:58:13] <%deviljhojho_> this is what we get
[2:58:16] <%DoubleRrico> but the bickering!
[2:58:19] <Profmcstevie> Love wife, wife not pulling weight, fight wife
[2:58:22] <%InternetShis> Yes but cuck Liara
[2:58:25] <Ashrox117> You need Ashley pat
[2:58:28] <secret_npc> You can have dope fucking hacker battles with Geth
[2:58:32] <%jillyrancher> garrus to cheese everything
[2:58:34] <RushUnplugged> wait did you fuckers guilt-trip Pat into playing on Insanity again
[2:58:34] <%cooldude69xx> It wasn't even that much of a fight
[2:58:36] <+GuilKato> to be fair garrus is always wanted on every mission because hes garrus even if he isn't a turret god
[2:58:37] <%jillyrancher> TehePelo
[2:58:45] <$hattrick61> use flare
[2:58:45] <%AmericanSkidd> now he works for you
[2:58:45] <djblue_shift> yeah me2 did this too where when you die and reload, sometimes the squadmates get swapped around
[2:58:52] <+cermo55> This mission is a lot easier when you can hack everything with 2 characters
[2:58:56] <digaogrunge> Garrus can save the galaxy with his machine gun, we dont really need you antmore shep
[2:58:57] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Sabotage has diminishing returns.
[2:58:57] <%InternetShis> Pat energy drain
[2:59:11] <%cooldude69xx> @RushUnplugged No Pat just keeps doing the thing that didn't work but again
[2:59:13] <DatAsuna> Gerrel is the worst cunt in the fleet
[2:59:15] <%peachy996> Yes blow the ship up with you in it
[2:59:17] <Sp3ctre48> Hahaha I'm stupid part 2 XD
[2:59:21] <%InternetShis> Ayyy
[2:59:24] <ape_hawk> pat, thats military shit
[2:59:38] <Profmcstevie> Imagine destroying the ship LEGEND Shepard is on cos ur salty
[2:59:42] <ape_hawk> yeah, happens all the time irl
[2:59:43] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I am of the opinion that Shepard would be morally justified in literally walking up to Gerrel and shooting him in the head for this
[2:59:44] <Zombrocom> Goddamn quarians
[2:59:45] <DatAsuna> I always picked the renegade choiec after this lol, every time
[2:59:46] <fugly_nick> Gerrel is literally just the same character as Loghain, voice and all
[2:59:47] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I really wanna know what the propaganda is like on the fleet
[2:59:49] <AthenaAegis> "Yes, great arguing, but i'm busy fighting a DAMAGE SPONGE right now."
[2:59:55] <DatAsuna> just cause fuck gerrel
[3:00:00] <%InternetShis> Why can't they just body block the heavy fleet and be all "but our species tho"
[3:00:02] <secret_npc> Next time I insanity run ME3 I'm taking Garrus and James for everything
[3:00:02] <%cooldude69xx> They read like actual aliens without self preservation instincts
[3:00:04] <Dunmarkh> The alliance should just nuke the quarians, like fuck man
[3:00:09] <%Mr_Pylon> Quarians are worse than the Batarians
[3:00:10] <djblue_shift> it's super useful for geth missions
[3:00:11] <DatAsuna> I did say it's great CC
[3:00:26] <+GuilKato> pat why do you keep attacking the sabotagued geth who are attacking other geth
[3:00:27] <haisho> yeah it makes fighting Geth MUCH bearable
[3:00:30] <studleydoorite> god I hate bullet sponges
[3:00:33] <tanarath> Yeah, Sabotage is PRETTY GOOD
[3:00:48] <%Agami23> yeah no, that makes sense
[3:00:48] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:00:50] <+trackles_64> that makes games boring
[3:00:51] <djblue_shift> i think it overloads weapons if it's not a synth
[3:00:52] <DatAsuna> You can make it affect the guns on organic enemies too though
[3:00:53] <%jillyrancher> Primes are probably the most bullet spongey enemy
[3:00:55] <Profmcstevie> You hate choice?
[3:00:59] <djblue_shift> so it's still good cc
[3:01:00] <%cooldude69xx> @JustAnotherTrapArtist "Only YOU can pretend the geth are a bigger problem than reapers"
[3:01:01] <Chaos_Aether> thats dumb
[3:01:01] <count_bob> that's a you thing.
[3:01:02] <tanarath> Pat, sometimes enemies are different
[3:01:03] <digaogrunge> It is a Pat issue
[3:01:06] <Sp3ctre48> I love Prime death animation
[3:01:06] <%jillyrancher> They are too stubborn to fucking die
[3:01:08] <biyatchboi> im with u, thats y i never use it
[3:01:09] <haisho> it technically does SOMETHING to everything, but it does extra against Geth
[3:01:10] <%peachy996> That's your need for optimum showing itself
[3:01:11] <%InternetShis> By the time you get Tali, Sabotage is very relevant
[3:01:13] <Srthunda> I get that
[3:01:15] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt sabotage also makes regular enemies unable to use their guns
[3:01:16] <@QueequegTheater> "Pat, lover of role-playing games, wishes games had less role-playing"
[3:01:17] <Zombrocom> I would agree but you just bring a different team for different enemies
[3:01:19] <%RetroCop87> Is this stream chugging for anyone else right now?
[3:01:23] <Dunmarkh> @Profmcstevie pretty sure he just said the opposite but okoy
[3:01:24] <%cooldude69xx> I like the occasional hard counter power
[3:01:25] <%DianaTheAscian> you mean to the player or all enemy factions the same?
[3:01:30] <stormhawk9891> No
[3:01:31] <+ThomasOfTroy> It's fine
[3:01:32] <Dunmarkh> one guy
[3:01:32] <cpt_langosta> streams fine here
[3:01:35] <%walternatorz> stream is good
[3:01:35] <zerointelligence000> no it's fine
[3:01:36] <%Dementedpenguin> Fine for me
[3:01:37] <+Rofiarf> its fine
[3:01:37] <%RetroCop87> huh, sorry for the false alarm then
[3:01:37] <%DoubleRrico> makes for more varied viable playstyles
[3:01:38] <%athuramn> that leads to the godfall problem
[3:01:38] <%AmericanSkidd> refresh
[3:01:39] <stormhawk9891> Fine here
[3:01:39] <fugly_nick> I see no chugging
[3:01:40] <Zombrocom> Nah we good here
[3:01:40] <secret_npc> No chug
[3:01:41] <Maids4lyfe> looks fine here
[3:01:41] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Like how hardcore is their desire to die for Rannoch
[3:01:41] <WebmanJax> I just had a chug too.
[3:01:43] <%Dementedpenguin> And I'm running two streams
[3:01:47] <djblue_shift> like i found sabotage really useful in the citadel dlc
[3:01:48] <PanicSwytch> Twitch's been having issues all day
[3:01:54] <%jillyrancher> Not really?
[3:01:58] <Maids4lyfe> @RetroCop87 try refreshing
[3:02:05] <cpt_langosta> garrel just tried to kill you, pat, you gonna take that?
[3:02:10] <%AmericanSkidd> really, i didnt notice
[3:02:14] <%SpcOpsBear> Pat is the kind of person who plays a bard in D&D so he can do a bit of everything well, rather than specializing in a few things that he can be godlike at.
[3:02:15] <AngryAsian5> FUCK YOU GERREL
[3:02:18] <GustauveVIII> loghain hopping universes just to fuck you
[3:02:18] <%jillyrancher> These assholes
[3:02:26] <Psyramics> why are geth fighters pilotable
[3:02:27] <+GuilKato> go hug best boi!
[3:02:35] <%cooldude69xx> @JustAnotherTrapArtist They would rather die on rannoch, a planet they've never been to, than live literally anywhere else
[3:02:37] <%RetroCop87> party members
[3:02:37] <+ThomasOfTroy> Specializing for specific things is annoying because you're committing levels/skill points/resources to specific situations and effectively wasting them for everything else
[3:02:38] <fugly_nick> That's what your party is for
[3:02:39] <secret_npc> When Rannoch is over, Tali doesn't have much purpose on missions. For combat or dialogue
[3:02:40] <@Ranryu692> then you have a bad DM
[3:02:40] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt That's what the party is for
[3:02:42] <Marpolo13> that's why you have friends !
[3:02:44] <Jmann1892> that's what the party is for
[3:02:44] <akitanito> that's why you have a team
[3:02:44] <+miguelrod777> you have other party members
[3:02:44] <Profmcstevie> DO YOUR ROLE PAT
[3:02:44] <%cooldude69xx> You have a party Pat
[3:02:45] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt thats why you have a pary
[3:02:45] <shallaska> that's what the party's for dude
[3:02:45] <%deviljhojho_> imagine playing a bard unironically tho
[3:02:45] <+trackles_64> you party up
[3:02:46] <@Spydurman> that's what your party is for
[3:02:46] <zerointelligence000> that's why you have a party
[3:02:48] <quipquest1> That's what your PARTY is for
[3:02:48] <%SpcOpsBear> Then you tell a different party member to do it ( :
[3:02:49] <Vyskus> yeah but dnd is literally a game with other people
[3:02:49] <WebmanJax> That's what the rest of the party is for.
[3:02:49] <%peachy996> then you git gud
[3:02:50] <%DianaTheAscian> party*
[3:02:51] <%UvBenServed> Isn't that why everyone hates ranger?
[3:02:53] <%JamesCorck> Bard is a great class, tho.
[3:02:54] <Sp3ctre48> That's why you have other people with crippling specializations
[3:02:54] <fugly_nick> YES
[3:02:54] <%JamesCorck> Come on.
[3:02:54] <terrible35> your GODLIKEness will always overcome pat
[3:02:56] <digaogrunge> You have a party for that
[3:02:57] <+archangel9889> but you are screwed if you cant deal with anything!
[3:02:58] <%deviljhojho_> pfffft
[3:02:58] <%Deft_Thought> Nah, all rounder
[3:02:58] <Visorak6> Thats why a party exists and a good DM will not make someone completely useless in an encounter @PatStaresAt
[3:02:59] <Marpolo13> LUL
[3:03:00] <Profmcstevie> This isn't a single man game, you're in a party
[3:03:01] <+Goraka91> Eat shit
[3:03:01] <akitanito> goddamn shep
[3:03:02] <+Krecart> This bit is so silly
[3:03:04] <+miguelrod777> YOU HAVE ROLES PAT
[3:03:04] <@Spydurman> what do you solo FF14 raids? Do everything yourself?
[3:03:05] <Sp3ctre48> This is what Konosuba is about Keepo
[3:03:05] <%jillyrancher> That's what your party is for
[3:03:05] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> The quarians are so dumb
[3:03:05] <%DoubleRrico> wat if 2 people want to bard
[3:03:06] <%JamesCorck> Bard is a very good class in D&D, what the hell.
[3:03:07] <%valriot> Then why do you play Dark Knight when you basically need a White Mage?
[3:03:07] <Profmcstevie> How does this man play FF14
[3:03:08] <lloyddboy> PAT WILL ONE GUY THROUGH IT ALL
[3:03:09] <@QueequegTheater> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:03:10] <Marpolo13> but the party isn't ME BabyRage
[3:03:10] <%InternetShis> Incorrect, Pat
[3:03:11] <%Arweynn> wait why would geth fighters be piloted by frames? wouldnt they just be like armatures? just bigger specialised frames?
[3:03:13] <%DrTomT18> i love Legion
[3:03:15] <+Krecart> they have you fall all dramatic like to just run up a side path in 5 seconds
[3:03:15] <Ashrox117> Damn shep eat shit
[3:03:16] <WebmanJax> So instead you'd rather be useless in ALL situations?
[3:03:17] <%jillyrancher> Yes
[3:03:18] <+el_of_house_wood> Pat’s logic is why I play soldier
[3:03:18] <%demiiluna> You're wrong. Pat plays a Wizard because a wizard is broken and can solo everything and literally handle any type of encounter.
[3:03:20] <%cooldude69xx> Like, its the point of having different classes, to specialize
[3:03:20] <%Ynkubus_> @UvBenServed no, ranger's issue is having half there kit being rarely used
[3:03:21] <%peachy996> Renegade prompt when you see it
[3:03:21] <DatAsuna> the party is for you to bolt on extra powers
[3:03:23] <%Fooguwu> Pat would just insist the entire party plays bards, to cover all the bases
[3:03:26] <%jillyrancher> that's how DnD works
[3:03:28] <Dunmarkh> Chat neither plays d&d nor understands what pat is talking about, based
[3:03:28] <$hattrick61> Dammit Gerral, you're lucky Tali's hips are a mile wide or you'd be long gone.
[3:03:29] <Sp3ctre48> Geth technology confuses me
[3:03:31] <%AllenDeadman> ouch
[3:03:33] <Vyskus> This conversation has gone off the rails. Pat clearly understands specialization because he plays an mmo
[3:03:36] <%peachy996> You'll want to renegade Gerrel when you see him
[3:03:37] <%deviljhojho_> 5 bard run
[3:03:39] <Virokwet> Man i remember none of this
[3:03:39] <Dova573> I'm guessing you always for for almighty spells in SMT games?
[3:03:39] <%deviljhojho_> its time
[3:03:40] <ape_hawk> how do you "read a loss of gravity"?
[3:03:40] <%Agami23> what pat is describing is actually a problem in D&D for rangers that have favored enemies. like if you are in a city and your advantage is against undead enemies you're fucked
[3:03:43] <Sp3ctre48> Like do they really get inside their own fighters?
[3:03:43] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Yeah Liara are shit there
[3:03:44] <+Snohobeau> This went fucky
[3:03:45] <%demiiluna> Pat is the Batman Wizard
[3:03:53] <%tamale_senpai> The real problem is that Garrus was not on this mission
[3:03:57] <%JonathLP> Is that a mini reaper?
[3:03:58] <%deviljhojho_> its actually been almost 8 years since i played this
[3:03:58] <notsoy> that fighter looks like a shrimp lol
[3:04:03] <@Spydurman> @Agami23 that's just cause the Ranger class sucks
[3:04:04] <%deviljhojho_> i hate time
[3:04:04] <%JohnAtDawn> JOKER LUL
[3:04:07] <%DrTomT18> probably should have brought Garrus
[3:04:07] <%tamale_senpai> You know, fuck master supreme
[3:04:13] <%MidnightBurst12> that fighter design looks cool
[3:04:16] <akitanito> I'm surprised the quarians aren't shooting you down
[3:04:17] <+GuilKato> legion would know there was plenty of room - but Shepard's massive balls would take up a lot of cargo space
[3:04:19] <PaperyHornet1013> jarl did nothing wrong
[3:04:28] <%deviljhojho_> it coulda gone way better
[3:04:28] <Dunmarkh> yeah pat is describing how rangers suck ass
[3:04:32] <%AmericanSkidd> There is a line coming up from Shepard that I just LOVE
[3:04:33] <+trackles_64> war crimes
[3:04:36] <$SGrim> Surprise, idiots. The geth have 6 more dreadnaughts!
[3:04:37] <tanarath> It wasn't.
[3:04:38] <%CapnBeefs> Fucking morons
[3:04:38] <%cooldude69xx> @Agami23 That is a longtime issue.
[3:04:39] <%Ynkubus_> @Spydurman worse, its neglected
[3:04:42] <%DrTomT18> you think the Quarians care?
[3:04:46] <zerointelligence000> yeah all but one quarian is stupid
[3:04:49] <akitanito> there's nothing to understand
[3:04:49] <tanarath> The Quarians are fucking assholes
[3:04:52] <%strakillias> Like, I don't begrudge them blowing up the dreadnaught but FFS wait for Shepard to get off the thing
[3:04:53] <mighty_fine_trousers> Punch him
[3:04:55] <%jillyrancher> they dont care lol
[3:04:55] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> war crime go up
[3:04:57] <%deviljhojho_> why are quarians so deranged
[3:04:57] <+GuilKato> also Pat be prepared to hit a thing on the war table
[3:04:57] <%JonathLP> We know exactly where earth is
[3:04:57] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I am of the opinion that Shepard would be morally justified in literally walking up to Gerrel and shooting him in the head for this
[3:05:00] <hassanico2> They have a fleet of garbage though!
[3:05:00] <count_bob> We lost earth.
[3:05:01] <+hielotauro> ONE QUARIAN
[3:05:01] <mighty_fine_trousers> PUNCH HIM
[3:05:03] <PaperyHornet1013> interrupt
[3:05:05] <%Conscript_Gary> That dreadnought would have kicked some major ass against the Reapers, just saiyan
[3:05:06] <hassanico2> Like aren't they mostly civilian ships?!
[3:05:06] <%Agami23> its becaused having skills that favor specific enemies is shitty. because theres a chance you dont fight a ton of those enemies
[3:05:07] <cpt_langosta> interrupt means punch, btw
[3:05:10] <%JamesCorck> Right trigger!
[3:05:12] <%peachy996> Renegade Punch him
[3:05:12] <%AmericanSkidd> BEAT HIS ASS
[3:05:14] <%cooldude69xx> NONE OF THE QUARIANS HAVE EVER BEEN TO THIS STUPID PLANET, WHY DO THEY CARE THIS MUCH?
[3:05:14] <%InternetShis> Gerrel is psa1guy
[3:05:14] <%JamesCorck> Right trigger Pat!
[3:05:16] <@QueequegTheater> USE THE INTERRUP
[3:05:17] <+trackles_64> what anarse
[3:05:21] <DatAsuna> R2!
[3:05:22] <%kekkerscrew> Biggest fleet, but it's a garbage fleet
[3:05:22] <AngryAsian5> Kill him now, it's only fair LUL
[3:05:25] <bearwagon> why is paragon agreeing with him
[3:05:26] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> All it takes is one asshole officer to fuck up a state
[3:05:28] <fugly_nick> THAT'S Renegade?
[3:05:29] <%jillyrancher> HIT EM
[3:05:29] <%DashXero> Punch this fucker.

[3:12:36] <%Deft_Thought> Is this a "Glass Him" situation
[3:12:36] <Shade075> She's listening to her playlist, she couldnt hear the deathly screaming
[3:12:37] <mesamus> uh...
[3:12:37] <mattynezz> Why would it mean the table is scary? How is that LESS stupiud?
[3:12:37] <DarkJaguar124> Shut up though...
[3:12:38] <%rDAKODAc> You are really over thinking it
[3:12:38] <MiamiMemory> You have a right to be angry
[3:12:38] <Virokwet> just learn teh games obtuse and wierd rules PAT
[3:12:39] <%walternatorz> she is like Paige. You know she can't hear if she's reading
[3:12:39] <%barrakuta371> She couldnt hear you over her reading
[3:12:41] <haisho> HOW CAN THIS BE
[3:12:41] <PaperyHornet1013> why is this VOLUS mad?
[3:12:42] <+miguelrod777> SHE CANT HEAR WHILE SHE READS
[3:12:43] <+jaco_checkbox> warn a brother
[3:12:43] <%jillyrancher> wat
[3:12:43] <ryderbootz> Thats wrong Pat
[3:12:44] <intestinal_bleeding> THIS TABLE IS FUCKING HAUNTED
[3:12:44] <mr_saturday93> NotLikeThis
[3:12:45] <$hattrick61> well this has been a moment.
[3:12:46] <+GuilKato> Warn her that the ship is about to die
[3:12:46] <LightningLynx89> IT WARNS HER OF THE FLEET DYING PAT!
[3:12:47] <@Ranryu692> warn her that the ship is going to blow up if she doesn't do something
[3:12:48] <studleydoorite> can you leave the tinnitus simulation zone
[3:12:49] <+FoolsArcade> GLASS HER
[3:12:49] <+Baileymiab> warn her that she's about to lose her shipp??????
[3:12:50] <%cooldude69xx> Why not just hit the buttons>
[3:12:50] <Admiral_PopnFresh> i.e. warn
[3:12:50] <%Piemono> What Warn her about that table? That doesn't make sense either
[3:12:51] <mattynezz> Those all mean the same thing
[3:12:52] <Brandon__Brando> your both able to hear it
[3:12:52] <robosqueeb> you are WARNING of DANGER
[3:12:53] <jorniev> SHE IS RIGHT THERE HOW DID SHE NOT HEAR IT
[3:12:54] <$realm_forge> She can’t hear when she reads like Paige
[3:12:54] <Marpolo13> at the very least I can agree that "inform" would have been better
[3:12:54] <+ThomasOfTroy> The word warn itself is the issue?
[3:12:55] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Paige race cant hear whiling reading
[3:12:55] <RyuuAoi> SHOT HER
[3:12:55] <%DrTomT18> Jesus christ this is the worst.
[3:12:56] <MsYakumo> Get some sleep, Pat. Your brain's frying.
[3:12:56] <SaltyAzteca> IM DYIN OF LAUGHTER
[3:12:57] <Virokwet> other synonyms
[3:12:57] <DarkJaguar124> I guess inform is the correct word
[3:12:58] <+Rofiarf> she is right next to it
[3:13:00] <%jillyrancher> Pat I love you but that makes no sense lol
[3:13:00] <+PenmanLupine> reaper......reaper......reaper.....reaper.....
[3:13:00] <%valriot> Quebec English options when
[3:13:01] <%maenos2> warn works fine pat
[3:13:01] <%peachy996> Quality is slipping
[3:13:06] <BurdRightsActivist> The table scary? So it's the Mario 64 Piano?
[3:13:10] <%xcompleasedad> Can you feel the ending? Bleeding into the game? Feels great, huh? mjbNice
[3:13:10] <studleydoorite> eeeeeeeeee
[3:13:11] <+Tucker1149> Tucker1149 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[3:13:12] <fugly_nick> Yeah that's fair
[3:13:13] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Yes
[3:13:15] <%Gelphaze> That's really bad it makes no scents at all.
[3:13:15] <Sp3ctre48> I'm on Pat's side this time, that was stupid
[3:13:16] <Vyskus> that's very true
[3:13:17] <%AmuserName> Yes, this is a dumb exception to the rule
[3:13:17] <+Goraka91> She's right fucking there chat how are you defending this LUL
[3:13:17] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> thats fair actually lol
[3:13:20] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pat they screamed "We're literally about to die" and you waited fifteen seconds to do anything
[3:13:20] <+DocReapoff> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[3:13:21] <Marpolo13> that's fair honestly
[3:13:21] <lord_sykos> He has a point
[3:13:22] <+Kharinite> Pat does have a point
[3:13:22] <%Monkeyweed21> she cant hear anything while reading
[3:13:22] <@Ranryu692> they knew you could just reload the autosave
[3:13:23] <zhenthrim213> you have a point
[3:13:25] <Zombrocom> I mean, yeah nothing else works like that
[3:13:26] <+Snohobeau> :)
[3:13:28] <$hattrick61> sun down, brain off. for all of us
[3:13:28] <digaogrunge> Yeah, this game has PROBLEMS
[3:13:29] <Dunmarkh> But the price stabilite
[3:13:29] <%barrakuta371> That's fair
[3:13:29] <Brandon__Brando> @xcompleasedad ^
[3:13:29] <%AllenDeadman> oh no, the game is falling appart
[3:13:29] <%peachy996> Change the rules up!
[3:13:29] <+Rofiarf> feels rushed right?
[3:13:30] <PaperyHornet1013> kiss tali pat you will feel better
[3:13:30] <Aiutare47> Alright fair enough
[3:13:31] <Virokwet> is the hot mess starting?
[3:13:31] <%cooldude69xx> Its really out of no where to be fair
[3:13:33] <jorniev> BAFLING DESING
[3:13:34] <+SataruYamate> i agree, she should be able here it, but videogame gotta videogame
[3:13:35] <SaltyAzteca> Inconsistent, its bullshit
[3:13:35] <Ashrox117> 🪔
[3:13:37] <LightningLynx89> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[3:13:40] <%TungstenViper> Warning people of something happening IN FRONT of them doesn't make sense
[3:13:40] <%cooldude69xx> But why not just hit buttons?
[3:13:41] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Fair
[3:13:41] <%maenos2> "inform someone in advance of an impending or possible danger, problem, or other unpleasant situation."
[3:13:43] <Brandon__Brando> chat your dumb
[3:13:43] <fugly_nick> Your reasoning here makes sense
[3:13:43] <Admiral_PopnFresh> ok
[3:13:44] <%peachy996> It's fun to switch the rules every now and then!!
[3:13:46] <mighty_fine_trousers> Admittedly that does seem like a design issue
[3:13:46] <+Snohobeau> Damn, thats crazy
[3:13:47] <+archangel9889> @PatStaresAt She was listening to her jams and couln't hear the message
[3:13:47] <%walternatorz> totally a failed implementation of the mechanic
[3:13:48] <zerointelligence000> almost missed it the first time
[3:13:51] <%peachy996> Isn't it fun
[3:13:51] <knight_verse> nitpicking because you didn't understand... nice.
[3:13:53] <Dunmarkh> Based lack of situational awareness shepaed
[3:13:54] <+miguelrod777> it popped up after you heard the distress call
[3:13:55] <digaogrunge> we know Pat
[3:13:57] <robosqueeb> pat you're dumb but its okay we don't mind
[3:13:58] <MiamiMemory> Has anything happened like this in previous sessions?
[3:14:01] <%AmuserName> It's dumb, sure.
[3:14:01] <%xcompleasedad> @Virokwet Yes. Can't wait for Thessia!
[3:14:05] <%ahomeschooldropout> Glad you cleaned up that message you could clearly understand
[3:14:05] <+FoolsArcade> you're overthinking it, I thnk
[3:14:06] <Profmcstevie> Take off your airpods woman
[3:14:07] <%DrTomT18> pat just move on. please.
[3:14:07] <lloyddboy> SHE'S BUSY
[3:14:09] <dekkitout> So was that a timed thing or what?
[3:14:09] <Shade075> good job pat by warning her you just secured the true good end
[3:14:10] <LightningLynx89> Goblins' activating because you don't get it Pat. We understand
[3:14:11] <%senfood> Pat's actually right. It's counterintuitive as fuck.
[3:14:11] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Warn appeared on the screen as them message was playing
[3:14:12] <+SataruYamate> for some reason they added an extra trigger to that quest
[3:14:14] <%LeiaSkynoober> Pat
[3:14:15] <Zombrocom> It is odd that that is a QTE when nothing else like that is in the game
[3:14:16] <%xcompleasedad> @MiamiMemory No
[3:14:17] <mattynezz> This is a really dumb thing to get hung up on
[3:14:20] <%LeiaSkynoober> Pat is SO not wrong here
[3:14:22] <RyuuAoi> Time travel?
[3:14:24] <+Goraka91> Fuck you
[3:14:25] <+JustToWatch> BUT STEEL'S HEAVIER THAN FEATHERS
[3:14:26] <PaperyHornet1013> talk to legion
[3:14:30] <@QueequegTheater> @tanarath Don't use that word like that, please
[3:14:31] <%jillyrancher> it's fine
[3:14:32] <+BlooBirdo> D: racism
[3:14:35] <jorniev> @PatStaresAt IT doesnt make sense she is standing in front of the same screen as you
[3:14:38] <%DrTomT18> loosing my mind
[3:14:38] <Virokwet> oh god, i do remember thessia
[3:14:40] <%bassoontyphoon> psaPat APOLOGIZE psaPat
[3:14:41] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> It's still a sentient being Raan you fucking idiot
[3:14:47] <%cooldude69xx> @mattynezz Kind of, but goblins I guess
[3:14:51] <%LordSDB> No Pat is right, the game really doesn't TELL you, you need to do this. Especially with how the game has treated audio to him thus far.
[3:14:57] <Srthunda> chat is so mad
[3:14:57] <willsin4fun> shes got airpods
[3:14:59] <%tamale_senpai> Is this the only time responsive action in the game?
[3:14:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Next bit
[3:14:59] <knight_verse> How is it that clicking a button and then clicking it again to talk to a character is that difficult to understand?
[3:15:01] <Brandon__Brando> @LeiaSkynoober HOW? your both next to it wtf are your warning her about
[3:15:01] <fugly_nick> She's old, she can't hear too well
[3:15:01] <%Fooguwu> she's reading she cant hear pat, like paige
[3:15:03] <%tempestzephyr> that doesn't sound like an apology....?
[3:15:03] <%AmericanSkidd> Shepard saying "Legion is my Friend" like a shonen protagonist is my favorite thing in the whole series
[3:15:04] <zhenthrim213> NEXT BIT
[3:15:07] <Profmcstevie> *Inform person watching TV that the show we're watching is on*
[3:15:07] <%Monkeyweed21> She cant hear while she reads
[3:15:15] <%walternatorz> Can we just talk to Legion the remainder of the game?
[3:15:16] <@Lion_kun> Legion is best party member.
[3:15:17] <DartAran> It's future radio tech that only plays sound in a 20 degree cone
[3:15:18] <%InternetShis> Quarians are fucking stupid, this is well established canon
[3:15:19] <%cooldude69xx> @LordSDB It's also not an important prompt
[3:15:20] <+Baileymiab> unfortunately video games do not have to make sense
[3:15:23] <PaperyHornet1013> she's listening castle super beast pat
[3:15:25] <%DrTomT18> Legion is friend
[3:15:25] <%TungstenViper> like, having anything else other than "warn" could have worked better. like "SAVE THEM" ffs
[3:15:28] <robosqueeb> she has hearing blindness
[3:15:29] <%bassoontyphoon> is Pat going to get the Gussy
[3:15:29] <%toastybites> you have to play this as a 2012 gamer
[3:15:33] <%MugenSandan> Honestly the Quarians would seem at least 1% more normal if they didn't elongate and emphasize IT at every chance they get
[3:15:42] <$realm_forge> This is somehow Kei Lang’s fault
[3:15:42] <jorniev> LIKE WHAT DID SHE HAD HER AUX ON !?
[3:15:49] <+GuilKato> best robot boy!
[3:15:50] <LightningLynx89> Oh so the Geth are targeting civilains. Sure sound like the good guys. Fuck these Flashlights.
[3:16:01] <%kekkerscrew> Best Boy
[3:16:08] <cpt_langosta> unfortunately, he doesn't count as a full party member
[3:16:10] <ryderbootz> person working on laptop with tv on next to her doesnt know whats going on in the fucking tv show
[3:16:11] <@Ranryu692> @LightningLynx89 the "civilians" that are attacking them
[3:16:15] <Zombrocom> The Reaper mind controlled* Geth are targeting civilians.
[3:16:16] <+BlooBirdo> ok spock
[3:16:17] <Sp3ctre48> It's okay they're attacking civilians in self defense
[3:16:19] <$hattrick61> OH NO RAAN HAS OMNI PODS IN
[3:16:20] <Virokwet> Legion MVP
[3:16:22] <%Conscript_Gary> I love how the Geth just flat-out refuse to call the reapers by their scary title
[3:16:26] <%Saffry_Ruzin> @lightninglynx89  Did you forget the Civilian ships have guns?
[3:16:27] <%jillyrancher> Lynx simping is hard for Quarians lol
[3:16:28] <Aiutare47> I love these missions, especially the one coming up
[3:16:40] <%jillyrancher> TehePelo
[3:16:40] <%Conscript_Gary> They just go 'okay boomer'
[3:16:42] <Marpolo13> can we not...fix him? He sees kinda fucked up
[3:16:44] <%SirGO0SE> man i love all forms of "legion" in media. we always kick ass
[3:16:50] <%cooldude69xx> @LightningLynx89 Dont bother arguing. This is literally the only thing this guy talks about
[3:16:52] <+Goraka91> Those people are actively screaming
[3:16:52] <DatAsuna> Shepard "How dare you make the choice that I made for you"
[3:16:53] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Next bit
[3:16:53] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> War
[3:16:55] <%Meekest> Because the quarians have been so competent
[3:16:59] <%SvenHolgersson> Yea this ain't your personal email
[3:17:00] <Zombrocom> He likes the fucked up body
[3:17:01] <Profmcstevie> this is like not knowing the radio is on
[3:17:03] <robosqueeb> its also a dumb videogame though so uh
[3:17:03] <%peachy996> It's funny because I'm literally multitasking right now with my tv and labtop
[3:17:04] <%TungstenViper> plus, the transimission was them SCREAMING
[3:17:04] <mikeriffic> Paige cant hear things when she reads
[3:17:05] <jorniev> the dude was screaming
[3:17:05] <shallaska> and it's like a dude screaming "HEY WE'RE DYING HORRIBLY"
[3:17:05] <Aoworth> No but she's playing Candy Crush right now
[3:17:05] <@Spydurman> this is a race of Paige's so yes
[3:17:06] <%SvenHolgersson> It's a fucking war
[3:17:09] <%TungstenViper> exactly LUL
[3:17:10] <cpt_langosta> never let paige become a space admiral
[3:17:10] <%Fooguwu> PAT IT'S WAR THERE'S NO TIME
[3:17:11] <SaltyAzteca> linkin park on blast
[3:17:11] <jorniev> SCREAMING
[3:17:12] <%InternetShis> @PatStaresAt She's a quarian
[3:17:12] <GamerWorlock> Nag same thing
[3:17:13] <fugly_nick> Also, you still hear the TV while you're on a laptop
[3:17:14] <LightningLynx89> @LightningLynx89 The Quarian Civilians didn't choose to have the guns put on the ships they live on. So the Geth are actively targeting their "creators" they want to protect.
[3:17:14] <Brandon__Brando> she has her earpods on
[3:17:16] <Virokwet> Im sure teh admiral has leraned her lesson by now
[3:17:19] <digaogrunge> You also got confused
[3:17:20] <Profmcstevie> Very Paige like
[3:17:20] <%cooldude69xx> That could be someone elses job to worry about
[3:17:22] <+Bouerd> Do you really expect any better from these losers? LUL
[3:17:23] <mattynezz> Pat, it was for 5 Rep points
[3:17:23] <+ThomasOfTroy> Actually no, they wouldn't. Their officers are supposed to inform them when something like that happens
[3:17:25] <Madinki> She was reading so she couldn't hear, Pat @PatStaresAt
[3:17:26] <%walternatorz> Admiral Paige is an esteemed military officer and her hearing is above reproach
[3:17:27] <%sunsetdisc0> its not her fault she had her airpods in
[3:17:27] <+vaderxyz1970> Probably not the only one screaming for help
[3:17:27] <$realm_forge> PAIGE CANT HEAR WHEN SHE READS
[3:17:35] <Dunmarkh> What if bioware were actually bad at making videogames?
[3:17:38] <supergoblinpunch> She was reading Undertale fanfics, give her a break
[3:17:40] <%peachy996> Oh god ou're right she was READING so she couldn't HEAR. IT IS PAIGE!
[3:17:40] <%InternetShis> Wow that zoom out
[3:17:45] <Vyskus> listen I can't hear when I read either
[3:18:00] <%AmericanSkidd> LUL
[3:18:01] <+Goraka91> Of course :)
[3:18:02] <%Fooguwu> LOL
[3:18:04] <%Conscript_Gary> lmfao
[3:18:04] <%JohnAtDawn> LUL
[3:18:05] <@Spydurman> LUL
[3:18:06] <%SirGO0SE> but can you think what you smell?
[3:18:07] <alwayspronking> LUL
[3:18:07] <Sp3ctre48> Writing Undertale fanfiction in the mafia
[3:18:09] <jorniev> LUL
[3:18:10] <LightningLynx89> And yeah I'll simp the Quarians
[3:18:11] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat The problem is that there are 30 captains screaming different thing at the same time there is a reason that military staff are usually 10s of people going over everything
[3:18:13] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> shep salty lol
[3:18:13] <@Spydurman> Geth superiority
[3:18:14] <Virokwet> LUL
[3:18:15] <%DrTomT18> Legion has the best writing
[3:18:18] <Gorshum> LUL
[3:18:18] <+Krecart> Why do the Geth continue to just be the best? xD
[3:18:23] <%LordSDB> Legion is so rad
[3:18:25] <TheLocalRival> #
[3:18:25] <Admiral_PopnFresh> True AI
[3:18:29] <+Alcamest> Is this Modded?
[3:18:35] <+GuilKato> The quarians killed geth heaven!
[3:18:36] <%InternetShis> YEAH DYSON SPHERE SO COOL
[3:18:36] <dekkitout> Like one of dem big jupiter brains?
[3:18:49] <%SirGO0SE> DYSON SPHERE? PogChamp
[3:18:50] <TheLocalRival> Hey Pat how come you aren’t in my McDonald’s commercial whenever I get the ad break
[3:18:57] <+Goraka91> Yeah Geth genocide attempt 2!
[3:18:57] <zhenthrim213> for whom the bel tolls
[3:19:06] <%senfood> @LightningLynx89 I'll simp alongside you but I won't act like this entire geth war wasn't the dumbest, most ill-timed thing in fucking history.
[3:19:07] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> This concept reminds me of SOMA.
[3:19:08] <+Soliloquy123> Like the burning of the Library of Alexandria except if everyone also lived there.
[3:19:09] <Vadrigar1994> The Geth have literally done nothing wrong, holy shit
[3:19:10] <Virokwet> wierd way to think of things
[3:19:12] <studleydoorite> it's the opposite for people, if everyone else on earth died I'd be the smartest
[3:19:14] <%SirGO0SE> man i love dyson spheres
[3:19:14] <MiamiMemory> @Sp3ctre48  Main character's name is Michael Megalovania
[3:19:14] <%AmericanSkidd> They blew up Geth Heaven
[3:19:18] <robosqueeb> legion is a good boy
[3:19:22] <TheLocalRival> The Geth are the real homies
[3:19:23] <Aoworth> Don't know what the concept of free will would mean to robots
[3:19:28] <BurdRightsActivist> Kiss his lightbulb
[3:19:30] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat I think the idea is that Raan is caught up reading logistics, and the warning thing is like shaking her and saying "Fuckin save them*
[3:19:30] <%DrTomT18> did you bring Tali to your cabin?
[3:19:32] <+Goraka91> But they're EVIL ROBOTS Pat!
[3:19:33] <%SirGO0SE> the star trek dyson sphere ep is so good too, with old man scotty
[3:19:35] <%walternatorz> noooo I don't want to stop talking to Legion. Give him more dialogue
[3:19:35] <LightningLynx89> Quarians are still in the right. Fuck the Geth.
[3:19:38] <Sp3ctre48> That's dumb Legion but everyone involved in this war is dumb so I guess that's okay
[3:19:38] <+Alcamest> IDC Tali Can get it!
[3:19:38] <PaperyHornet1013> betray tali pat put your money where your mouth is
[3:19:40] <%Mattais88> @Goraka91 Probably more like 52b
[3:19:41] <medoodoo> the geth story reminds me of Frankenstein
[3:19:42] <robosqueeb> legion is practically commander gethperd

[3:21:28] <+miguelrod777> for you
[3:21:29] <SaltyAzteca> THAT IS A JOKE.....RIGHT?
[3:21:30] <%Fooguwu> they talked about why before
[3:21:30] <sponsoredviewer910> so you can hear it
[3:21:30] <+ThomasOfTroy> Edi does it for us, remember
[3:21:30] <%cooldude69xx> They want you to hear them
[3:21:30] <+Goraka91> Legion is in on it
[3:21:31] <+JustToWatch> to fuck with you
[3:21:32] <%DashXero> That's a good question, Pat.
[3:21:33] <%kekkerscrew> So that it's less rude
[3:21:33] <Zombrocom> For you
[3:21:33] <+garbagegenesis> for you the player
[3:21:33] <%peachy996> For the player
[3:21:34] <robosqueeb> terrifying scene
[3:21:34] <+cermo55> they're being nice to you
[3:21:34] <+Bail_Seven> there is an ingame answer
[3:21:34] <@QueequegTheater> Specifically for Shepard's benefit
[3:21:34] <cpt_langosta> EDI refuses direct comms from legion when organics are present
[3:21:35] <AngryAsian5> Cause they respect you
[3:21:35] <akitanito> because they are doing it for you
[3:21:35] <+ThomasOfTroy> They did it ME2
[3:21:35] <+ScrapKingKeita> Because they're messing with you
[3:21:36] <Profmcstevie> haha your cpu is slow
[3:21:36] <@Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt didn't they explain that in 2?
[3:21:36] <dekkitout> For *your* convince
[3:21:37] <%castlerock42> They mentioned that in 2.
[3:21:37] <Virokwet> why indeed
[3:21:37] <alwayspronking> to style on Shepard?
[3:21:37] <%xcompleasedad> So you can hear it, because EDI HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR
[3:21:38] <count_bob> Pat you literally know why
[3:21:38] <Ashrox117> Haha. Ha…
[3:21:39] <%InternetShis> For you
[3:21:39] <%Mattais88> They say something about that in Shadow broker
[3:21:40] <$lotharrio> They aren't gonna open up communication links.
[3:21:40] <%Conscript_Gary> EDI does it intentionally, she talked about it in a shadow borker log
[3:21:40] <%walternatorz> because they're communicating your defeat in secret
[3:21:41] <%demiiluna> They covered this in ME2
[3:21:41] <Tracazoid> They do it for you
[3:21:41] <BurdRightsActivist> for edi
[3:21:41] <%tamale_senpai> They want to be like us
[3:21:41] <Vermillion129> to imitate human communication
[3:21:42] <+ALazo> because not talking aloud freaks people out
[3:21:42] <Aoworth> They're shopping their comedy routine
[3:21:44] <%DrTomT18> there was a message in Mass Effect 2 about that
[3:21:46] <Blackleafx> @PatStaresAt EDI doesnt like to interface with Legion, didnt they say that in 2?
[3:21:46] <mighty_fine_trousers> You sure it isn't just EDI putting Legion on blast?
[3:21:48] <%hrbeck_> To joke with you
[3:21:49] <Vyskus> they're doing it for shephard
[3:21:50] <Virokwet> probs to scare shep with thier jokes
[3:21:50] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Edi doesn't want Legion in her system
[3:21:53] <%bread_assassin> @PatStaresAt They commented on that in the Shadow Broker DLC in 2.
[3:21:53] <%chill_o_wisp> LUL
[3:21:55] <BurdRightsActivist> -bane voice- 4 u
[3:22:00] <RyuuAoi> Human after all
[3:22:00] <%rockcentuar> EDI dosent like it remember tooo many voices
[3:22:03] <Sp3ctre48> They want you to hear them plotting to dissect  your brain
[3:22:07] <%bassoontyphoon> Are beauty pageants still a thing in the future??
[3:22:08] <%jillyrancher> Cause EDI doesn't like talking without speaking
[3:22:10] <SaltyAzteca> its cute!
[3:22:18] <jorniev> SHEPPARD REALLY DOESNT WANT TO DIE ON SPACE AGAIN
[3:22:22] <%SirGO0SE> woah she is top heavy :flushed:
[3:22:26] <$lotharrio> Joker as he bangs a robot: Man, it's weird that Legion cosplays as you.
[3:22:31] <@Ranryu692> also EDI thinks it's rude to the rest of the crew to talk to Legion digitally
[3:22:32] <stormhawk9891> @bassoontyphoon Evidently
[3:22:41] <TheLocalRival> Wow I really wish they got Seth Rogan instead of Seth Green from robot chicken

[3:27:31] <%deviljhojho_> he LOVES it
[3:27:31] <tanarath> Doc was r i g h t
[3:27:33] <%DashXero> Garrus knows how to get shit done.
[3:27:33] <Profmcstevie> "Dictators, Pog"
[3:27:34] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> That is what happened to Javik
[3:27:35] <%peachy996> Would still fuck him
[3:27:36] <+geekjacob> PAT, YOU REDPILLED GARRUS
[3:27:36] <%AmericanSkidd> sometimes
[3:27:36] <%snow_bush> He comes from a militarized society
[3:27:36] <%cooldude69xx> He didnt say it was good
[3:27:37] <dekkitout> Was that not obvious in ME1?
[3:27:39] <%JonathLP> Garrus is a bro, but he has a lot of red flags
[3:27:39] <Ekaelis> understanding doesnt mean glorifying
[3:27:40] <zerointelligence000> reeducate him please
[3:27:41] <+hielotauro> HE HOT SO ITS OKAY
[3:27:41] <%peachy996> Dick tate this
[3:27:42] <%jillyrancher> I mean....hes not entirely wrong
[3:27:43] <%hrbeck_> He is a cop and a facist
[3:27:44] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Well, within the context of the game LUL
[3:27:44] <jorniev> GIVE DOC MONEY
[3:27:46] <+JustToWatch> SUBLETY
[3:27:48] <DatAsuna> garrus was ALWAYS this way
[3:27:49] <count_bob> Garrus was always like that.
[3:27:54] <Tracazoid> "So Javik and I were talking and I like what he's selling"- Garrus
[3:27:56] <LightningLynx89> I don't think he like it. I think he just seems to understand that dictators do get things done quickly.
[3:27:56] <SaltyAzteca> Its a thought, he isnt going to be one
[3:27:58] <shallaska> Garrus got redpilled by the holonet
[3:28:01] <%deviljhojho_> "im based shepard, YOU'RE the soyjack"
[3:28:01] <%DrTomT18> in the case of fighting the Reaper, he's totally right!
[3:28:02] <%Mattais88> Nah Sidonis did it
[3:28:09] <RushUnplugged> you have to FORCIBLY REMOVE the redpill from Garrus' mouth as he keep trying to swallow more
[3:28:10] <%stantheman_97> understanding is not the same as condoning
[3:28:12] <%athuramn> he saw you punch the general and it rustled his renegade jimmies
[3:28:14] <cpt_langosta> but pat, huey is based and red-pilled
[3:28:22] <ryderbootz> oh yeah, youre totally cucking Tali
[3:28:23] <%toolofparanoia> Garrus is just based and dictator pilled on his own
[3:28:24] <%JamesCorck> Yes they do.
[3:28:24] <GustauveVIII> they tell you
[3:28:24] <TheLocalRival> Soyboy Shepard vs the Chad Dictator Garrus LUL LUL LUL
[3:28:25] <mr_saturday93> You see it
[3:28:26] <BurdRightsActivist> Garrus just went on space 4chan, what do you think he's doing while he's "calibrating"?
[3:28:27] <%hrbeck_> Garrus is eating horse paste when you turn your back
[3:28:27] <%JamesCorck> No.

[3:28:29] <ryderbootz> er Garrus
[3:28:30] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Of course Garrus broaches the subject, his homeworld is run by a military government isnt it?

[3:29:39] <%maenos2> if you take garrus on the dreadniught mission, he mentions that doctor friend of his sending him turian chocolates.  tali will note of it, especially if you're femshep and dating garrus
[3:29:41] <%Mattais88> She's a space KKaren

[3:29:45] <%toolofparanoia> karin
[3:29:46] <LightningLynx89> I don't think Garrus' understanding is condoning. He literally says "Now I understand why the galaxy sometimes needs dictators." Never says he wants it, understands it. Also he's a Turian. A people who live in a hierarchical military society.

[3:42:55] <%LeiaSkynoober> Hey Pat have you ever thought about how the Quarian and Geth backstory is basically just Detroit: Become Human if the android won?
[3:42:55] <BurdRightsActivist> DUBSTEP

[3:44:53] <+doc_ock_rokc> doc_ock_rokc subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[3:44:53] <%cooldude69xx> @moonmintparadise A little of both. The geth have been trying to keep the atmosphere creator friendly though. Because they're evil
[3:44:54] <%xcompleasedad> @moonmintparadise Their immune systems are a parasite thing. They need years to acclimate to an environment, then they are immune forever.
[3:44:57] <ryderbootz> organics REALLY dont like fire
[3:44:57] <%LumberjackJack> Rannoch: basically Tucson
[3:45:00] <santafer> First quarian to die in Rannoch in 300 years, what an honor

[3:45:43] <%Mattais88> TURF WAR: Threser Maw vs Diablos

[3:46:20] <%kekkerscrew> I sure do love it when I can spam broken abilities
[3:46:22] <$Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt Why didn't the quarians just go to another planet to inhabit? It seems like they could.
[3:46:23] <KeystoneA2> Yes.
[3:46:23] <%peachy996> It is
[3:46:24] <%JamesCorck> It is.
[3:46:27] <%JamesCorck> It 100% is.
[3:46:29] <Sp3ctre48> @Vermillion129 I take issue with the conflict in general honestly, the Quarians really shouldn't be as stupid as they're framed here
[3:46:29] <@QueequegTheater> Yup
[3:46:32] <%LumberjackJack> Reusing old assets, yup
[3:46:33] <%cooldude69xx> @Mekhet09 They never explain why. They just turn their noses up at the idea of not dying in a fight with geth
[3:46:34] <PaperyHornet1013> HAVE JAMES DISABLE GUNS
[3:46:36] <+Soliloquy123> It's Tali's leitmotif

[3:50:49] <mikeriffic> use gun more
[3:50:50] <akitanito> legendary busted

[3:51:05] <Assaultpanda> Geth Prime staggers you with it's shots. have to recover to use powers
[3:51:08] <cpt_langosta> this game looks pretty hard, but not nearly as hard as Microsoft Bob
[3:51:15] <$hattrick61> the rockets and the prime staggar you and reset the spitfire's windup
[3:51:17] <%peachy996> Find a target to waste it on or just throw it away
[3:51:25] <%senfood> @LightningLynx89 But they weren't genocidal. They only ever acted in self defence. In fact, it was the Quarians who were genocidal. You're saying you'd prefer genocidal Space North Korea.

[3:52:11] <%tamale_senpai> Wither down the enemies shields then charge in with that WAP smasher!
[3:52:11] <LightningLynx89> @senfood One is an organic. The other is not. Rather deal with Organics than Synthetics.
[3:52:17] <Profmcstevie> You are the magic conduit for james powers
[3:52:18] <RushUnplugged> squad skills are treated effectively as your own for aim
[3:52:23] <%Saffry_Ruzin> @vermillion129 Not in MP
[3:52:25] <BurdRightsActivist> @Vermillion129 Geth Primes are like gundams, I'm pretty sure.
[3:52:36] <%Conscript_Gary> ME1 power usage was so fucking clunky
[3:52:36] <%senfood> @LightningLynx89 haha have fun with the Quarians then

[3:53:08] <+CherteuseKapibara> mic so tasty~
[3:53:11] <%SpcOpsBear> ...then why don't you keep Paige's mic off when they're not sitting near you?
[3:53:24] <Shade075> @LightningLynx89 well the batarians want to conquer the galaxy and turn races into slaves while the Geth mjust want to be left alone

[3:54:15] <%LumberjackJack> Ooof
[3:54:18] <%senfood> Oh yeah, Jona!
[3:54:19] <karl_rex> Jona's an orphan now
[3:54:19] <DatAsuna> admiral vas quib quib
[3:54:23] <%silvery_cricket> Shepard "Who the hell is Jona, give us a last name"
[3:54:29] <SaltyAzteca> BACKSTABBUUUUU
[3:54:29] <GustauveVIII> Jona's mother died aboard the Alerei in ME2. woooooooo
[3:54:29] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I guess the birds were smarter than the Quarians since they're not getting glassed
[3:54:30] <bahookery> his son is mentioned on a audiolog on Tali's mission in ME2
[3:54:32] <LightningLynx89> Once again Geth shooting on innocent Civilian vessels
[3:54:32] <%AmericanSkidd> Jona is an orphan now
[3:54:34] <%senfood> LUL
[3:54:39] <%hairtoday> vas rannoch is a nice touch
[3:54:40] <Vermillion129> sound like most war
[3:54:43] <%SinnerEbru> war. war never changes
[3:54:43] <+GuilKato> Jona is cursed - his mummy loves him very much and she died on Tali's father's ship @PatStaresAt
[3:54:45] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> It aint me it aint me
[3:54:46] <KaitlynnHere> Good, I’m glad
[3:54:46] <+Krecart> It is, yeah.
[3:54:47] <LightningLynx89> She voted NO Pat
[3:54:51] <Jmann1892> She tried stop it tho
[3:54:52] <Aiutare47> But as stated previously Tali voted against it
[3:54:53] <zhenthrim213> @LightningLynx89 wow so we just lying now
[3:54:53] <DatAsuna> you're not even wrong
[3:54:54] <SystemShut> she didnt want the war either though
[3:54:54] <%Monkeyweed21> she voted against it
[3:54:55] <LightningLynx89> She and Korris were outvoted 3-2
[3:54:58] <%alphonseisbest> So an American Soldier?
[3:54:58] <BurdRightsActivist> SHE TRIED TO STOP IT
[3:54:59] <%Mattais88> She was outvoted, so it could have been a civil war instead
[3:55:01] <$realm_forge> God the quarians are so stupid
[3:55:02] <Zombrocom> She got outvoted
[3:55:03] <%RetroCop87> "complain about it under the covers, commander"
[3:55:03] <mr_saturday93> #quariansdidnothingwrong
[3:55:04] <%strakillias> Jonat having parents anymore
[3:55:07] <santafer> That means Shepard is in bed with a Politician
[3:55:09] <+MisterAvry> dayum
[3:55:11] <%senfood> @LightningLynx89 Your bit is hilarious and I love it. Stay golden, friend.
[3:55:14] <KaitlynnHere> Get got wrecked
[3:55:14] <%walternatorz> turret
[3:55:15] <+GuilKato> jona's mother died I mean
[3:55:15] <%jillyrancher> She got outvoted
[3:55:16] <%AmericanSkidd> his mom died, he is now an orphan
[3:55:20] <+Tonku_the_Red> PAT she was AGAINST this whole thing/
[3:55:21] <%peachy996> Jona is a Quarian Batman now
[3:55:21] <%afronooch> they heard what you said about jona
[3:55:23] <dekkitout> F
[3:55:23] <RyuuAoi> She's gotta vote harder next time.
[3:55:23] <%greasypete00> so the quarians are super gonna have to pay for this later right?
[3:55:25] <lloyddboy> TURRET
[3:55:27] <%Fooguwu> what was your plan
[3:55:27] <%xcompleasedad> That's the gun YOU use
[3:55:27] <akitanito> big turrets back at it
[3:55:28] <+trackles_64> its a turret pat
[3:55:28] <Vermillion129> he charge a pyro
[3:55:32] <%kekkerscrew> That was a bad move
[3:55:33] <Profmcstevie> Turrets turreting
[3:55:35] <fugly_nick> You can't just Charge at everything
[3:55:38] <%walternatorz> the geth are working with cerberus now
[3:55:39] <BurdRightsActivist> NO-UNGA, NUNGA'
[3:55:39] <Zombrocom> Man, TURRETS go brr in this game
[3:55:39] <KaitlynnHere> Being an orphan will only make him stronger
[3:55:39] <%boxboten> boxboten subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! wwwwww
[3:55:40] <Sp3ctre48> it matters a little
[3:55:40] <%kekkerscrew> What matters is Tali Failed
[3:55:41] <%silvery_cricket> Sounds like Jona needs to get some revenge
[3:55:41] <%cooldude69xx> @senfood Thinking of it as a bit is way better, thank yo
[3:55:44] <+trackles_64> turrets go brrrr
[3:55:46] <%RetroCop87> Look at Pat, poking and prodding at sensitive chat
[3:55:46] <%jillyrancher> Pat
[3:55:47] <Madinki> AHHH TURRETS MY OLD NEMISSIS
[3:55:49] <AthenaAegis> WOW. Good shot from that Geth
[3:55:50] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> Turret doing turret things
[3:55:53] <%peachy996> Stop finding reasons to spank her you dirty awful man
[3:55:55] <+BlooBirdo> she could have filibustered the vote forever and ever Kappa
[3:55:58] <%jillyrancher> Why you charge at the turret
[3:56:07] <bahookery> holy shit James
[3:56:08] <akitanito> geth rocket trooper plus turrets
[3:56:10] <Aoworth> The Geth rocketeers are such assholes
[3:56:14] <Vermillion129> Pat is using asari shotgun right? was it the Disciple?
[3:56:15] <%hrbeck_> Orphan? That means he’s going to turn into a robot
[3:56:15] <zhenthrim213> @cooldude69xx yea ive been laughing for the past 3 sessions
[3:56:18] <Ashrox117> That was cool charging past the missile
[3:56:20] <$hattrick61> its worse, raan and tali knew they would be out voted anyway so they went along so the fleet wouldnt be outvoted
[3:56:21] <Madinki> @peachy996 But it's a great butt to smack
[3:56:21] <+MisterAvry> pro tip: shoot the turret until it dies
[3:56:26] <lloyddboy> LUL
[3:56:26] <+trackles_64> no guns for u
[3:56:29] <Aoworth> Oh...
[3:56:29] <%RetroCop87> BLUE BALLS
[3:56:32] <%AmericanSkidd> soon
[3:56:33] <LightningLynx89> So Shepard is responsible for everything Cerberus has been involved. So he's just as responsible for Cerberus attempting a coup on the Citadel by Pat's logic.
[3:56:35] <dekkitout> See if Jimbo can carry that turret with him Kappa
[3:56:37] <%Mattais88> @santafer Since every other human politican is dead, and Udina, and Anderson and Hakett isolated Shepard's probably the leader of humanity right now
[3:56:41] <+Tonku_the_Red> Bionic charge is so ridiculous in this game.
[3:56:42] <PaperyHornet1013> james again
[3:56:46] <%AmericanSkidd> NO DONT DO IT
[3:56:47] <%SinnerEbru> YES
[3:56:48] <ScaryMonstersTV> james
[3:56:48] <@QueequegTheater> Ye ye

[3:56:51] <%silvery_cricket> RENEGADE
[3:56:52] <Aoworth> Yeah sure
[3:56:53] <Dunmarkh> ye
[3:56:53] <%kekkerscrew> Tali is better for fighting the geth
[3:57:01] <KaitlynnHere> Kill em
[3:57:02] <+Tonku_the_Red> The soldier who likes shooting things.
[3:57:05] <fugly_nick> Yeah I dont think this one really matters
[3:57:08] <akitanito> now you get the turrets
[3:57:13] <Parapattern> "Duh, if you say so, boss."
[3:57:17] <%jillyrancher> OH PAT THERE'S A MISSABLE COLLECTIBLE HERE
[3:57:18] <%maenos2> OH god turret secrion
[3:57:19] <%RealThiele> hes very uncertain of everything
[3:57:28] <%xcompleasedad> He's kicking it
[3:57:29] <%AmericanSkidd> he is breaking shit
[3:57:31] <Dunmarkh> He's kicking it again?
[3:57:32] <DatAsuna> just rip and tear
[3:57:33] <%RetroCop87> he's trying to break the turret
[3:57:36] <$hattrick61> how did they get outvoted anyway? Raan Tali and Koris were against while Gerral and the other one were for
[3:57:38] <Aoworth> He kicked it good
[3:57:38] <%SpcOpsBear> It means he kick it really hard
[3:57:39] <PaperyHornet1013> he kicked something lose like a badass
[3:57:40] <+vaderxyz1970> Why does this turret us BULLETS!?!
[3:57:40] <Aiutare47> actually with James on an upgraded Typhoon and his carnage being spec'd against Pyro'
[3:57:40] <Madinki> I love the sound of this Turret
[3:57:45] <%silvery_cricket> IF ONLY KAI LENG WAS HERE!!!
[3:57:47] <%strakillias> This turret is kinda what it would be like to play garrus
[3:57:50] <BurdRightsActivist> He's "hacking" the AA gun 4Head
[3:57:55] <%jillyrancher> I think you can buy it from the Spectre Terminal
[3:57:56] <akitanito> it's a problem with modern shooters
[3:58:01] <%RetroCop87> would Halo colors work better?
[3:58:06] <%JamesCorck> Yeah but Pat, who's fault is it?
[3:58:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> !uptime
[3:58:10] <@Moobot> @rumtumtugnutz I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 58m.
[3:58:11] <Profmcstevie> Lighting is a very precise art that is underappreciated
[3:58:16] <%JamesCorck> Is it your fault for not seeing or the game's fault?
[3:58:17] <%InternetShis> @vaderxyz1970 Big Bioware Budget
[3:58:20] <cpt_langosta> betrayed by turrets even when you're behind them...
[3:58:23] <%sunsetdisc0> oh hey theres a thing you need for a fetch quest in the area of the last aa gun
[3:58:30] <%SpcOpsBear> @PatStaresAt You think THIS is bad?! The Battlefield games from at LEAST 4 and onward are even worse about this!
[3:58:35] <%silvery_cricket> If only Kai Leng was here to stop the AA guns
[3:58:47] <%AmericanSkidd> I missed it to, just buy it at the citadel later
[3:58:48] <Admiral_PopnFresh> "If you say so"
[3:59:00] <%peachy996> Remember Pat, RE6 came out in the same year
[3:59:05] <santafer> Kai Leng could Judgement Cut the turrents with his katana
[3:59:05] <%peachy996> And that was grey
[3:59:07] <%cooldude69xx> @silvery_cricket Kai Leng would whip the gun with his dick that is huge and long to disable it
[3:59:09] <%sunsetdisc0> @PatStaresAt the target jamming thing was in the area of the last AA gun
[3:59:18] <%xcompleasedad> Chunky
[3:59:20] <Profmcstevie> Also, war at night is hard. Daylight would make this easier I reckon
[3:59:22] <%jillyrancher> It's in the area you were previously at @patstaresat
[3:59:23] <%RealThiele> big action
[3:59:23] <Madinki> I want a cut to James just sucking up the wires like spaghetti
[3:59:30] <+CyanDeadEye> There's a large computer monitor on the other side for the jamming tech.
[3:59:31] <%silvery_cricket> Whenever you are in danger just think "What would Kai Leng do"
[3:59:32] <DatAsuna> @peachy996 I remember playing the MP and going "man ift would be fun if we could slide" lol
[3:59:34] <%jillyrancher> The target jamming thing
[3:59:34] <KeystoneA2> >He left this spot
[3:59:34] <akitanito> welp
[3:59:35] <Aiutare47> you can buy it if you miss it
[3:59:37] <%senfood> @cooldude69xx And Slipknot would be playing in the background.
[3:59:38] <Dunmarkh> Buy it

[4:02:01] <%silvery_cricket> Kai Leng would of already saved the Admiral do better Pat
[4:02:03] <BurdRightsActivist> LONG TALL SALLY
[4:02:03] <%peachy996> Who likes Turret Sequences!
[4:02:04] <fugly_nick> The game industry really loved turret sections in this era
[4:02:05] <+cermo55> they should reaally be using that turrent more oftern
[4:02:05] <zhenthrim213> DAKKA DAKKA DAKKA DAKKA
[4:02:05] <+vaderxyz1970> Again why BULLETS!?!
[4:02:05] <%stantheman_97> it was always there don't worry about it
[4:02:05] <%cooldude69xx> The Mid 2000's turret section!
[4:02:09] <Ashrox117> This brings me back to the bowling alley
[4:02:09] <%Fooguwu> wait why does the turret have SHELLS
[4:02:11] <%RealThiele> ew more turret sections
[4:02:11] <%kekkerscrew> Why is it so dark. Get a spotlight on that thing
[4:02:11] <dekkitout> Christ, the muzzle flash is a tad much
[4:02:12] <$hattrick61> GIT SUM
[4:02:13] <+CherteuseKapibara> they really do blend in with the rocks huh,
[4:02:14] <Jaysky> Man all the games back in this time had mandatory turret sequences
[4:02:17] <%silvery_cricket> Kai Leng is the coooluest
[4:02:20] <%moonmintparadise> Just a tought, but MAYBE DONT SEND IN CIVILIANS TO FIGHT YOUR WAR IN THE FIRST PLACE
[4:02:20] <Profmcstevie> Just shoot at the muzzle flare PrideShrug
[4:02:23] <%sunsetdisc0> yo since when does this fuckin shuttle have a turret???
[4:02:23] <%jillyrancher> Hey, where's Kai Leng?
[4:02:24] <+MisterAvry> if they run, they're a geth. if they stand still, they're a well disciplined geth!
[4:02:26] <%cooldude69xx> @silvery_cricket Aw man. Kai Leng beat up all my bullies
[4:02:29] <%senfood> The only explanation I can think of for why the Quarians chose to do this is because they knew the universe was going to be overrun with Reapers and they wanted to see their homeworld before they went extinct.
[4:02:31] <dekkitout> WHIFF
[4:02:33] <Vinicius_75> man kai leng payed for my medical bills when I lost my arm, hes such a nice guy

[4:02:44] <%Saffry_Ruzin> All the guns use projectiles in ME
[4:02:45] <Sp3ctre48> That carnifex sure looks like a predator
[4:02:45] <%JonathLP> Always open the back door
[4:02:47] <%AmericanSkidd> sadness
[4:02:49] <%jillyrancher> Kai Leng could've saved the admiral and the crew
[4:02:51] <intestinal_bleeding> oh...
[4:02:52] <%silvery_cricket> Kai Leng would of saved his crew
[4:02:53] <+trackles_64> Paragon
[4:02:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Sadge
[4:02:54] <Jaysky> nyannSadge
[4:02:54] <%TheWinged7> its a good thing he only had the one shot too
[4:02:57] <%chill_o_wisp> we should go
[4:03:01] <BurdRightsActivist> Kai Leng could've saved both.
[4:03:01] <intestinal_bleeding> well. shit.
[4:03:04] <+hielotauro> paragon btw
[4:03:07] <%silvery_cricket> If only Kai Leng was here
[4:03:11] <intestinal_bleeding> that dog sounds like a geth
[4:03:17] <+GuilKato> Kai leng would have killed all 3 groups then dabbed over the corpses
[4:03:18] <Profmcstevie> Gief sounds like a motor
[4:03:19] <cpt_langosta> nah, you dropped him off somewhere else
[4:03:19] <PaperyHornet1013> KAI LENG would've saved both
[4:03:20] <%AmericanSkidd> they dropped him off
[4:03:20] <SaltyAzteca> No special eyes, welp
[4:03:23] <%AmericanSkidd> i guess
[4:03:24] <DatAsuna> Into STAYING?
[4:03:24] <%xcompleasedad> You took him to hius
[4:03:40] <%silvery_cricket> Kai Leng would of beat the reapers at Fortnite and save the UNIVERSE
[4:03:41] <mikeriffic> HE SUPER GETS IT
[4:03:43] <%sunsetdisc0> this man is the only one talking any sense
[4:03:50] <%peachy996> Because he's the only smart Quarian
[4:03:50] <%RealThiele> he'd make aplan and follow through, thats what mister Kai Leng would do
[4:03:54] <+SilverJakler> THOSE WE CAN YET SAVE
[4:04:09] <santafer> Korris first looked like an Udina in ME2, but I think he is the best Admiral
[4:04:13] <Virokwet> is this the guy that was the hardass on tali
[4:04:16] <+ThomasOfTroy> Hell no, the quariansa wouldn't have been nearly enough
[4:04:18] <BurdRightsActivist> good LUL
[4:04:25] <Sp3ctre48> Legion...
[4:04:30] <cpt_langosta> it's only a model...
[4:04:31] <LightningLynx89> OH LOOK. Synthetic allying with the fucking evil Robot Squids!
[4:04:32] <Jaysky> Legion sure does make me feel comfortable with this idea
[4:04:32] <%AmericanSkidd> That is a brain firing neurons
[4:04:34] <dekkitout> Galaxy brain
[4:04:35] <+trackles_64> oh shot
[4:04:38] <LightningLynx89> You can't trust these Synthetic fucks
[4:04:47] <ape_hawk> yeah but its red so its bad
[4:04:50] <%chill_o_wisp> it looks organic
[4:04:50] <BurdRightsActivist> THAT LOOKS EVIL AS SHIT
[4:04:51] <%silvery_cricket> Kai Leng would of dabbed on that life
[4:04:53] <%cooldude69xx> @Virokwet Yeah, Koris sucks too. He wanted to throw Tali under the bus for shit she didnt do
[4:04:58] <+GuilKato> the first one was life too
[4:04:58] <zerointelligence000> "stop giving them rights!"
[4:05:01] <fugly_nick> If it were anyone but Legion saying this, it would seem a lot worse
[4:05:02] <Aiutare47> Reapers made every geth fully sapient
[4:05:03] <%peachy996> So now let's throw away the interesting part about the Geth and make them individuals!
[4:05:04] <%SpcOpsBear> That isn't a circuit, it's a neuron!
[4:05:05] <+trackles_64> Paragon
[4:05:07] <Jaysky> Looks pretty fuckin evil though
[4:05:08] <LightningLynx89> THE GETH NEED TO DIE!
[4:05:08] <lloyddboy> BRAIN CELLS ARE SUPER EVIL YOU GUYS
[4:05:14] <+BlooBirdo> only a sith deals in absolutes
[4:05:14] <%silvery_cricket> Kai Leng would of made the right choice

[4:05:17] <%greasypete00> LUL

[4:05:43] <%sunsetdisc0> fun fact: the guy who wrote the geth in me2 quit me3 because he didnt like how the script was trying to give emotion to a race governed by logic

[4:06:01] <cpt_langosta> Pat, warn Raan there's a hologram right in front of her.
[4:06:01] <%silvery_cricket> Kai Leng should of been the protagonist of 3 and Andromeda
[4:06:03] <+GuilKato> Rods from God!
[4:06:05] <RyuuAoi> Cutting a lot of corners ha
[4:06:12] <dekkitout> Is that a literal beeg space gun?
[4:06:21] <DatAsuna> @JustAnotherTrapArtist kishook harpoon gun

[4:06:21] <Madinki> I DUNNO MABEY WE DON'T HAVE TO KILL THEM ALL. KEEP THE GOOD ONES BRUDDA!
[4:06:24] <+trackles_64> Do the squadron mission FIRST
[4:06:24] <%peachy996> So you never get to use it more than this one convienent time
[4:06:27] <%xcompleasedad> This bit is dumb, and is made dumber by the climax
[4:06:30] <%Fooguwu> orbital laser type stuff is cool pat shut up
[4:06:34] <%xcompleasedad> BUT IT LEADS TO GOOD SHIT

[4:06:52] <%silvery_cricket> NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR ANTI MACHINA SHIT WAKKA
[4:06:52] <+cermo55> its more of a signal bouy launcher than a proper gun
[4:06:56] <%cooldude69xx> @JustAnotherTrapArtist N7 Valiant. My baby was so smooth
[4:06:57] <%senfood> Why is everything involving the Quarians in this game the most ass backwards nonsense I've ever seen?
[4:06:59] <akitanito> goddamnit gerrel
[4:06:59] <LightningLynx89> You need to repair the ships
[4:07:01] <GustauveVIII> GERREL IS CORRECT EVEN THOUGH HES AN ASS
[4:07:02] <@QueequegTheater> You should support Gerrel here, unfortunately
[4:07:04] <DatAsuna> can't trust his assessment

[4:07:21] <Aoworth> Fuck off Gerrell
[4:07:21] <%silvery_cricket> I wonder what Kai Leng is doing right now?
[4:07:22] <GustauveVIII> oh well

[4:07:26] <%AmericanSkidd> fuck em
[4:07:35] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Oh yeah, semi auto sniper rifles are cool
[4:07:38] <LightningLynx89> Pat is racist towards Quarians
[4:07:39] <%Conscript_Gary> Just because he's correct doesn't mean he's right
[4:07:40] <VolticSurgeSA> Lost some warscore points for that
[4:07:40] <+trackles_64> need more strnght
[4:07:41] <Aiutare47> I think you will really like the Squadron mission Pat

[4:07:48] <peanutdot007> But what if you could kill Batarians to prove him wrong
[4:07:49] <%tamale_senpai> All of them?
[4:07:52] <+Requibumz> genocidal spite the best spite
[4:07:53] <%cooldude69xx> If only Kai Leng was here. He would kill the quarians for sure
[4:07:53] <%RetroCop87> God knows the quarians ahve already been doing it
[4:07:55] <%hrbeck_> Kai Leng is doing two chicks at the same time
[4:07:56] <TheHauntedTank> buncha qussys
[4:07:56] <+Goraka91> Quarians are barely above Batarians, and that's only because we're fucking one of them
[4:08:03] <DatAsuna> Remember how even Tali can't get on Korris' level of respecting the geth
[4:08:14] <%RealThiele> Kai Leng is busy playing with his N7 action figures
[4:08:14] <%cooldude69xx> @hrbeck_ His space ninja lady harem
[4:08:14] <%SpcOpsBear> We ARE doing -all -of the Rannoch missions tonight, right?

[4:10:38] <%AmericanSkidd> probably
[4:10:39] <+hielotauro> how is more guns a bad thing?
[4:10:39] <LightningLynx89> No
[4:10:39] <%peachy996> The quarian race are like toddlers
[4:10:40] <@QueequegTheater> Oh yeah
[4:10:41] <%Meekest> No you needed the Batarians
[4:10:41] <SaltyAzteca> I mean at the time it seemed like a good idea

[4:10:42] <Jmann1892> Yeah
[4:10:42] <$hattrick61> oh yeah

[4:10:53] <%Conscript_Gary> Can you repeat the question?
[4:10:53] <blackjack8182> Yep
[4:10:54] <santafer> DLC gives the extra you would need anyways
[4:10:55] <%jillyrancher> It's so depressing how good the dialogue is and then immediately its followed by yet another weird glitch or weird writing choice

[4:11:07] <cpt_langosta> one guy

[4:11:08] <%Sigma_190_Beta> I think you're gonna be fine if you do the DLC right @PatStaresAt
[4:11:09] <fugly_nick> You got Conrad's war assets, thats more  than enough

[4:11:10] <+MrIntake> LUL
[4:11:11] <%jillyrancher> You're fine

[4:11:12] <zerointelligence000> you're still scanning right>
[4:11:12] <ShiningAxis> you needed the batarians to be meat shields
[4:11:12] <%peachy996> You don't need the Batarians. You have Bray.
[4:11:13] <santafer> 5000 for perfect ending no?
[4:11:13] <LightningLynx89> Batarians are 400 points
[4:11:13] <+Goraka91> [X] Doubt
[4:11:14] <Yuroshi> all endings are the good ending
[4:11:14] <kingra> Batarians are SUPER important Kappa
[4:11:14] <haisho> WE SHALL SEE
[4:11:15] <+miguelrod777> you got dlc assets base game has enough
[4:11:15] <SaltyAzteca> All we need is Bray
[4:11:15] <%Piemono> hahahahaha
[4:11:17] <PaperyHornet1013> you need the BATUSSY
[4:11:17] <%LumberjackJack> You're killing it so far with the assets. You still have the DLC to add as well as a few more major fleets
[4:11:18] <studleydoorite> LUL you rarely see chat so split
[4:11:19] <%RetroCop87> The Batarians equip the Thrasher Maw for space flight
[4:11:19] <%InternetShis> MORE than enough, and you're not even that close to done
[4:11:19] <Sp3ctre48> You NEEDED Diana Allers Pat
[4:11:19] <%Meekest> You're fine Pat
[4:11:19] <Virokwet> green is teh goal i assume
[4:11:22] <%alphonseisbest> make sure u do EVERY side thing and ur good papt
[4:11:25] <%JamesCorck> you didn't need them.
[4:11:25] <%jillyrancher> No you dont
[4:11:26] <+Krecart> he will be fine.
[4:11:27] <+cermo55> 7200 i think you need
[4:11:28] <$realm_forge> You’re next few decisions will probably cover it
[4:11:29] <$hattrick61> a galaxy saved by the batarians isnt worth living in
[4:11:30] <T_Sasquatch> @santafer "perfec"
[4:11:30] <BurdRightsActivist> Just clone Bray LUL
[4:11:31] <Zombrocom> You will have plenty

[4:11:35] <%jillyrancher> Chat is lying @patstaresat
[4:11:37] <%JamesCorck> Pat you didn't need them, at all.
[4:11:39] <%Solid_Stro> Without Bray, bad ending confirmed
[4:11:39] <%stantheman_97> not having the batarians lets the reapers win
[4:11:43] <mikeriffic> especially with DLC assets
[4:11:46] <mikeriffic> youll have more then enough

[4:12:36] <%Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt But it's a Batarian Fish.
[4:12:37] <%peachy996> Batarian would have eels
[4:12:37] <%jillyrancher> Pat you can't just excuse it cause they got great hips
[4:12:40] <%jillyrancher> lol
[4:12:40] <PaperyHornet1013> flush that fish
[4:12:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Couldn't you just bathroom enough war resources on your side?
[4:12:49] <LightningLynx89> Pat bought a Batarian Fish, he loves Batarians
[4:12:56] <%cooldude69xx> @jillyrancher But the hips tho
[4:13:03] <BurdRightsActivist> Question: are Geth thicker than Quarians?
[4:13:06] <cpt_langosta> Allers locked the room when she left?
[4:13:08] <blackjack8182> Kai Leng already feed your fish.
[4:13:09] <intestinal_bleeding> D E A D
[4:13:09] <%jillyrancher> Let's do Geth Comm Hub!
[4:13:10] <peanutdot007> Shepard bought a Batarian fish because he loves sushi
[4:13:12] <%Monkeyweed21> uh oh Javik's getting racist somewhere
[4:13:12] <akitanito> a chance she didn't deserve
[4:13:12] <%Meekest> Fuck her
[4:13:13] <$Mekhet09> Who did you kill?
[4:13:22] <%InternetShis> AIRLOCK
[4:13:22] <%peachy996> She's not useful
[4:13:22] <%jillyrancher> Geth Comm Hub is all story, no combat Pat!
[4:13:25] <%LumberjackJack> Allers just suuuuuuuuuucks
[4:13:25] <$Mekhet09> Wait who did you get killed?
[4:13:27] <fugly_nick> Check the map if you're looking for Javik
[4:13:27] <%peachy996> She provides nothing
[4:13:27] <%bassoontyphoon> Thank fuck
[4:13:28] <+geekjacob> whos died?
[4:13:28] <%stantheman_97> you ejected her from the airlock
[4:13:29] <blue8moon> the reporter lady?
[4:13:29] <PaperyHornet1013> she gives you the hussy
[4:13:31] <%AmericanSkidd> you didnt leave the system, she must be with the quarians, or on the planet...
[4:13:33] <+MrATheGreat> ejected her right at a reaper via torpedo like they did spock
[4:13:34] <%senfood> What the hell is a Jessica Chobits?
[4:13:35] <+Tonku_the_Red> Did you airlock Chobot?
[4:13:37] <Dunmarkh> @Mekhet09 jessica chobot, it's a joke
[4:13:43] <%LumberjackJack> AI Core, maybe?
[4:13:44] <%sunsetdisc0> You should have waited until after completing the quarian arc so you could squeeze some more ems outta here
[4:13:45] <%DracosMagala> map
[4:13:46] <$Mekhet09> Oh lol.
[4:13:46] <%peachy996> All you missed out on were a post victory interview and a message about how Bekenstein blew up
[4:13:49] <$Mekhet09> He got rid of her.
[4:13:51] <PaperyHornet1013> map
[4:13:51] <cpt_langosta> javik was secretly in love with chobot, so he left with her
[4:13:51] <intestinal_bleeding> Jessica Chobot, DEAD
[4:13:53] <+GuilKato> check your map it shows the number?
[4:13:56] <intestinal_bleeding> DAD!?
[4:14:00] <%rockcentuar> MAP
[4:14:03] <%bassoontyphoon> The best way to deal with her, is to romance her and THEN eject her from the ship
[4:14:03] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat She has one okayish line where he home planet is destroyed by Reapera
[4:14:13] <+trackles_64> F

[4:14:30] <alwayspronking> F
[4:14:32] <CrowbarFacelift> I don't think I've ever heard this before
[4:14:33] <%peachy996> And the spirits are like nah
[4:14:35] <zerointelligence000> that's one way to meet the inlaws
[4:14:35] <digaogrunge> BRUTAL
[4:14:38] <dekkitout> If he had more power
[4:14:38] <+GuilKato> Shepard you give garrus a stealth shuttle so he can go rescue them like a total badarse!
[4:14:39] <akitanito> if only he calibrated the guns better
[4:14:41] <Ekaelis> sigh,
[4:14:41] <%DashXero> He's not wrong.
[4:14:41] <BurdRightsActivist> Woops, he got cut off. Yeah he's dead Garrus.
[4:14:41] <@DakotaMacDoodle> ooh that's grim.
[4:14:43] <+BlooBirdo> D: uhhhhh
[4:14:44] <maybefalco> pat have you ever seen the live-action adaption of "as the gods will"?
[4:14:44] <SaltyAzteca> Pat...
[4:14:44] <Vermillion129> Pat please
[4:14:45] <PaperyHornet1013> keep talking
[4:14:45] <+miguelrod777> they probably would be unironically
[4:14:45] <KeystoneA2> So Garrus, you got a sister...
[4:14:49] <ape_hawk> those evacuation shuttles wouldve run on time
[4:14:55] <+Tonku_the_Red> If only Garrus had done more calibrations. . .
[4:14:55] <DatAsuna> "my dad would have lived if you killed that doctor, shepard!"
[4:14:56] <%kekkerscrew> Had a sister
[4:14:56] <Dunmarkh> BACK TO CALIBRATING
[4:15:00] <KeiPrime> as the gods will is pretty dope
[4:15:02] <jorniev> HIS DAD WAS TO BUSY PLANING THE ANDROMEDA VOYAGE
[4:15:03] <%InternetShis> The whiplash
[4:15:05] <%stantheman_97> actually yeah probably
[4:15:11] <Ashrox117> Some say the dark side can give you powers that some would call…unnatural
[4:15:11] <%jillyrancher> The whiplash
[4:15:19] <+Goraka91> Well
[4:15:20] <LightningLynx89> Javik is right
[4:15:23] <%peachy996> Ah yes yell at the computer Javik
[4:15:26] <VolticSurgeSA> @KeystoneA2 Shepard looking to get himself some... tussy?
[4:15:27] <dekkitout> Is Javik on a suicide mission to be more wrong than Jacob?
[4:15:27] <fugly_nick> Is evolution not simply an upgrade?
[4:15:28] <%jillyrancher> Lemme kiss you Garrus
[4:15:30] <+GuilKato> that is literally evolution
[4:15:32] <Sp3ctre48> EDI right but Javik still based
[4:15:34] <peanutdot007> Javik you're part of the problem
[4:15:36] <+CherteuseKapibara> titty upgrade : DENIED
[4:15:36] <blackjack8182> Javik is always right
[4:15:37] <RushUnplugged> "why doesn't Tali like me, I'm based and redpilled and yet she whores out with that libtard Shepard"
[4:15:39] <%senfood> That's literally how organics evolve, Javik.
[4:15:42] <%LumberjackJack> If the turians are like the romans, it makes sense for Garrus to think a dictator is necessary (he's not right, just that the Romans had temporary dictator roles in times of crisis)
[4:15:43] <maybefalco> @KeiPrime i wanted my two hours back by the end of it
[4:15:43] <Vermillion129> fuck off javik
[4:15:48] <@Spydurman> eat shit Javik
[4:15:49] <%peachy996> JERRY JERRY
[4:15:51] <zerointelligence000> Javik: technology bad/ thomas edison was a witch
[4:15:51] <LightningLynx89> Javik is super right
[4:15:53] <ape_hawk> takes a lot to make EDI pissed, javik
[4:15:54] <$hattrick61> javik is a tool
[4:15:54] <zhenthrim213> wow
[4:15:57] <%watts121> THE OTHER RACES WERE SUBMISSIVE AND BREEDABLE
[4:15:57] <BurdRightsActivist> HOOO FUCK
[4:15:58] <murdocismyhero> OH snap
[4:16:00] <PaperyHornet1013> JAVIK IS BASED
[4:16:01] <%InternetShis> YO EDI IS PISSED
[4:16:01] <jorniev> yeah no fuck off
[4:16:02] <%chill_o_wisp> HOLY SHIT EDIS PISSED
[4:16:05] <Virokwet> shiza
[4:16:09] <T_Sasquatch> Javik is BASED
[4:16:10] <LightningLynx89> Javik is based
[4:16:12] <%toolofparanoia> Javik can eat a sock
[4:16:12] <+trackles_64> tell him edi
[4:16:14] <+Soliloquy123> I love how EDI is actually super pissed
[4:16:14] <AngryAsian5> BASED
[4:16:16] <%jillyrancher> @lumberjackjack Roman Dictators were elected too iirc and always gave up power for years
[4:16:17] <%Agami23> javik is a based and redpilled meme
[4:16:18] <T_Sasquatch> FUCK SYNTHETIC LIFE
[4:16:20] <%peachy996> Filthy Machine
[4:16:21] <%senfood> Eat shit, Javik
[4:16:21] <%moonmintparadise> By Jarviks logic, he should be subservient to EDI because she is literally stronger and smarter than him
[4:16:24] <@QueequegTheater> @xcompleasedad I don't think so
[4:16:25] <%peachy996> Death to All Machines
[4:16:26] <KeiPrime> idk i liked the wacky death games, manga goes harder with that
[4:16:30] <fugly_nick> Javik is such an asshole, he's great
[4:16:33] <%peachy996> KILL EDI AND THE GETH
[4:16:37] <Profmcstevie> The machine would kick your ass Javik, evolve this
[4:16:38] <PaperyHornet1013> its gonna rule when pat picks destroy
[4:16:41] <%jillyrancher> Edi pissed
[4:16:43] <+GuilKato> "but for the record, Edi is the best"
[4:16:45] <LightningLynx89> No if he kills EDI
[4:16:46] <+trackles_64> Shes not organiv tho
[4:16:47] <+ALazo> that's why he complains
[4:16:47] <wowzerman> EDI doesnt have rights cause shes a tool
[4:16:47] <SaltyAzteca> THATS GOOD
[4:16:48] <Profmcstevie> ADMIT WEAKNESS JAVIK
[4:16:49] <%Agami23> but no, it doesent count when its him
[4:16:51] <LightningLynx89> Can't rule if you're dead idiot
[4:16:51] <+Goraka91> She's not a REAL (Prothean) lifeform though
[4:16:52] <RushUnplugged> the strongest should rule but only when I am stronger
[4:16:53] <%peachy996> Nah
[4:16:53] <%DracosMagala> IDK about that
[4:16:56] <%xcompleasedad> @QueequegTheater Oh thank GOD. I don't want to miss that
[4:16:59] <+Zyquux> Javik has to pay extra for that
[4:16:59] <Kidbizzaro> I hear not the unholy cries of the Men of Iron.
[4:16:59] <jorniev> ALSO SHE CAN VENT HIM OUT THE AIRLOCK
[4:16:59] <%peachy996> I'm getting a Blue vibe off Pat
[4:17:00] <ape_hawk> Wait, Pat, you mean... a racist is being a hypocrite!?!??!?!?!?!!?
[4:17:00] <%Fooguwu> you dont understand pat, it only counts if Javik is on top
[4:17:01] <%kekkerscrew> Machines wanting to take over is actually the most illogical thing imaginable.
[4:17:01] <BurdRightsActivist> SUBMIT TO DOMMY EDI
[4:17:01] <zerointelligence000> I don't think ai count cuz in his words they're not natural
[4:17:02] <LightningLynx89> Also she's not an organic so it does not count
[4:17:02] <DatAsuna> racism trumps integrity
[4:17:02] <%Sigma_190_Beta> Is that Zangief I hear in the background?
[4:17:06] <peanutdot007> When was the last time Javik went faster then light
[4:17:06] <SaltyAzteca> By that logic he would be the weaker
[4:17:10] <%lumporr> wait isn't it that his logic that edi *would* dominate him so he's gotta get her now?
[4:17:10] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> me
[4:17:11] <%cooldude69xx> Because it wasn't a Prothean
[4:17:11] <%LumberjackJack> "It's different when it's me"
[4:17:11] <T_Sasquatch> he is being an asshole but man I refuse to let synthetic life exist
[4:17:11] <$SGrim> Javik just want's his pegging instant lose to Dommy-Mommy Edi
[4:17:13] <Profmcstevie> The strong rule the weak! "You aren't the strongest" FUCK....
[4:17:13] <+cermo55> might makes right except when im weak
[4:17:14] <Dunmarkh> Go give free rimjobs to the reapers Javik, they're strong as fuck
[4:17:14] <metalsiren31> AI's aren't people, obviously
[4:17:15] <%AmericanSkidd> Javik is like "You didnt win"
[4:17:17] <%toolofparanoia> javik laid low by the machinarcy
[4:17:18] <+Tonku_the_Red> But the rules don't apply to Javik therefore he is mightier!
[4:17:18] <%senfood> I love how Liara's honeymoon period with Javik lasted one conversation.
[4:17:18] <%Fooguwu> MMMMMMM, MEEEEEEE
[4:17:18] <%bassoontyphoon> In EDI’s eyes, everyone is submissive and breedable
[4:17:22] <Virokwet> mmmeeeeeeee
[4:17:23] <Happysobek> ALL HAIL EDI
[4:17:24] <%moonmintparadise> LUL LUL LUL
[4:17:25] <LeotheHuntsman> Yes. Basic Friend vs enemy distinction
[4:17:25] <BurdRightsActivist> mMMMMM, MEEE
[4:17:27] <Ashrox117> Everything Javik says is - Guy who lost
[4:17:27] <LightningLynx89> Javik is Based, EDI is Cringe, Rannoch belongs to the Quarians
[4:17:29] <Madinki> That only works if Javik admits weakness @PatStaresAt
[4:17:32] <santafer> aww

[4:18:02] <%jillyrancher> Most of what Javik says about Prothean society should be taken with a bit of salt in my opinion.
[4:18:03] <%moonmintparadise> Hell yeah
[4:18:05] <%maenos2> no signal
[4:18:05] <santafer> Reft Vas Rannoch

[4:18:40] <ryderbootz> we must save Cyber Arizona
[4:18:42] <%senfood> @jillyrancher Yeah, I'm pretty sure a lot of his interpretation is because he's an asshole.
[4:18:44] <RushUnplugged> those 18 hours naps

[4:20:58] <+justianxix> Sadge
[4:20:59] <+SilverJakler> NOOOOOOO
[4:20:59] <RushUnplugged> bannable offense
[4:21:00] <@QueequegTheater> They will be banned
[4:21:01] <blue8moon> ban them forever if they do
[4:21:01] <Vermillion129> banned 4 lyfe
[4:21:06] <%Agami23> oh god, im looking at a ff14 tweet of a paladin who refuses to use a shield. shits the worst
[4:21:07] <%Dakuu75> BibleThump
[4:21:20] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> banned hard
[4:21:23] <%afronooch> yeah
[4:21:25] <%Garthunox> @Agami23 YEYEYE!
[4:21:30] <%jillyrancher> Ban hard
[4:21:32] <dekkitout> The shooting or the whole shebang?
[4:21:33] <$SGrim> Watching good, playing bad
[4:21:33] <%SinnerEbru> rannoch is around when it kicked in, yeah
[4:21:34] <%SvenHolgersson> HE NOW KNOWS
[4:21:34] <%cooldude69xx> yes it is
[4:21:36] <%SvenHolgersson> THE FEELING
[4:21:37] <Brandon__Brando> ya I know what you mean
[4:21:38] <zhenthrim213> that DLC sucked didnit it
[4:21:38] <%RetroCop87> fatigue?
[4:21:41] <@Ranryu692> part of it is because you chose the least versatile class
[4:21:41] <%the_Punktuation> Its probably from shotgunning the whole series.
[4:21:44] <%moonmintparadise> The combat is VERY dull lmao
[4:21:45] <%DianaTheAscian> I'm somewhat burned out on watching it tbh @PatStaresAt
[4:21:47] <%TheWinged7> may be the marathon of the series
[4:21:47] <%DashXero> That's just Mass Effect 3.
[4:21:50] <%hairtoday> i found it doesn't work out as smooth as 2
[4:21:51] <PaperyHornet1013> take a break
[4:21:52] <mandorlalmond> yea
[4:21:55] <DusK_The_Stray> Yeah, the binging probably didn't help
[4:21:57] <+dd44dostivei> i also burn out on 3
[4:21:57] <%SvenHolgersson> The combat is the worst part by a landslide yea
[4:21:58] <peanutdot007> There's more combat and it's way more bullshit
[4:22:03] <@QueequegTheater> It gets easy way too early
[4:22:04] <@Spydurman> that might have been a lot of Omega weighing in
[4:22:05] <%Fooguwu> you also chose the unga class
[4:22:06] <%alphonseisbest> @Ranryu692 VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay
[4:22:07] <%stantheman_97> did you feel this before or after omega?
[4:22:07] <%SvenHolgersson> I just wanna talk to aliens man
[4:22:09] <Brandon__Brando> got to pad it out
[4:22:09] <Profmcstevie> Welcome to the "War game"
[4:22:09] <%Garthunox> lil bit of both me thinks
[4:22:11] <mikeriffic> yea thats why the combat feels better cus its more focused on
[4:22:12] <%hairtoday> it's like the gameplay is too polished
[4:22:12] <%JamesCorck> Thereabouts.
[4:22:14] <Visorak6> I'll be honest if I was watching this as a VOD I'd be skipping at points.
[4:22:15] <%cooldude69xx> Its an action game now
[4:22:15] <%maenos2> @ranryu692 vanguard most versatile though.  charge everything.  all you need.
[4:22:15] <%moonmintparadise> Talking to weirdo aliens about how wrong they are is better than shooting from one cover to the other
[4:22:16] <%SirGO0SE> get a little more tomented souls in there to give yourself a breather imo that game bangs
[4:22:17] <%jillyrancher> There is way more combat
[4:22:19] <WebmanJax> Doing Omega probably didn't help.
[4:22:21] <%JamesCorck> You're also tired of only fighting Cerberus.
[4:22:27] <+BlooBirdo> yeah it's doesnt leave much room to breathe
[4:22:29] <@Ranryu692> fights are more interesting when you're doing things other than just charging everything over and over
[4:22:29] <%JamesCorck> There's a lot of Cerberus fighting there.
[4:22:29] <Dova573> I did feel that way in the last mission
[4:22:30] <GetMendoza> GetMendoza subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[4:22:31] <%jillyrancher> it's what got most of the focus
[4:22:34] <dekkitout> Are the other classes more or less reliant on the cover?
[4:22:35] <%strakillias> Turn the difficulty down to burn through the fights to get to da story
[4:22:36] <%SinnerEbru> i binged mass effect when i played it (after the ending scandal long past) so i remember feeling that
[4:22:37] <+vdalson> its weird, i liked the combat a lot for the multiplayer, but didnt care about it in the campaign
[4:22:39] <mandorlalmond> i really enjoyed 3 but i was a dumb kid at the time
[4:22:41] <%JamesCorck> The enemy variety in ME3 is lacklustre compared to ME2 and ME1.
[4:22:49] <Ashrox117> Has Pat done a single biotic explosion yet?
[4:22:56] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat That's also why Citadel DLC is so good cause the 2nd half is just dialogue.
[4:22:58] <Maids4lyfe> no
[4:23:01] <Brandon__Brando> LUL
[4:23:01] <%Dakuu75> My condolences
[4:23:14] <%moonmintparadise> aww man get better !
