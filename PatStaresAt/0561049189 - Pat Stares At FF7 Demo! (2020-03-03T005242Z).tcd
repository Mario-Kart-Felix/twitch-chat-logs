[0:19:40] <assfordayz> I NEED to play Crisi core
[0:19:40] <%neVan0> LUL
[0:19:41] <@JustinianKnight> eh
[0:19:42] <shurtal> Max was doing a hdNES stream when the demo dropped, and it Derailed the FUCK outta the stream, it was great @PatStaresAt
[0:19:43] <%jessedouglas> 30-50 hrs probably
[0:19:44] <Froyuken> I barely touched the demo but plan to later.
[0:19:45] <%tactician0> I was about to go to sleep when I saw it drop
[0:19:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Try 70 hours
[0:19:46] <garbageheaphound> that sounds likely
[0:19:46] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> This game is gonna make me like Jessie. Oh no

[0:20:01] <@JustinianKnight> Crisis Core has alot of big problems in it's gameplay
[0:20:03] <%j0ustar> Crisis core was fine. those side missions and final hours though.....
[0:20:04] <%HiroTSK5> Based on what I've played this game is basically a bigger budgeted Crisis Core
[0:20:06] <%Wrashis> Wrashis subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! hey pat. played the demo. not a fan of the "classic mode" being just a super easy mode and not actually turn based, but the rest of the demo is super good.
[0:20:06] <Froyuken> Jackie's so thirsty for Cloud.
[0:20:07] <+solzan2000> 7GB
[0:20:07] <shin_marx> If the 40 hours are really good and replayable, that's fine
[0:20:10] <%OkamiDude15> they said they want each part of ff7 to be about the same length as ff13. so 60-70 ish
[0:20:10] <%michingmallecho> I wish I could get crisis core on psn
[0:20:11] <KoryMccool> ....

[0:26:11] <Punisher7771> why not go near old people
[0:26:12] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> don't touch your nose
[0:26:12] <%KENTASHIRO> The Flue is way worse than coronavirus

[0:26:24] <rcand9> wash em good
[0:26:25] <jcflyguy> Paaaaaaaaat. That's not true. IT's not better than washing but it helps
[0:26:26] <%Ranryu692> it's better than doing nothing in a pinch, but yeah, soap and water is much better
[0:26:27] <Clu_Flynn> wash em nice
[0:26:27] <%ExpressNode> Water ain't antivirus either

[0:26:48] <+kawachipto> need at least 60% alchohol for it to be the same
[0:26:49] <+hmgirlpopuri> Coronavirus can't get you if you're a brain in a jar
[0:26:50] <%chronotriggerhappy123> as someone who works in a hospital i am a habitual hand washer so im not so worried about catching it and more worried about all the other people catching it
[0:26:50] <+Donchalant402> thx

[0:27:04] <%hotcarl6872> you don't have to play RE6 anymore
[0:27:05] <ape_hawk> does the plan involve banking your sleep hours ?
[0:27:07] <Drusain> Wasn't your plan to NOT play RE6?
[0:27:09] <majima666> i was in a chinese restraunt the other day and someone said something about wearing masks to one of the people behind the counter....i felt super shitty for them

[0:27:43] <+NitronStreams> IT FUNNY
[0:27:44] <%Takreth> Never trust a potato farther than you can punt them
[0:27:45] <%Ranryu692> 2B is Aerith

[0:29:27] <+JorDandere> Hello fellow gamers, I too am here to stare at the FF7 Demo with Patrick.
[0:29:28] <%Frost_Quill> I push both sticks up down left right, with the last two reversed for the right stick, at the same time a lot when I use controllers.
[0:29:28] <Solidnick18> that sucks
[0:29:28] <%weissguard> Ah, okay. Thanks! @bashful_bard
[0:29:29] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> And that dance is the Corona

[0:29:31] <$RetroCop87> did KH create the term "dodge roll"?
[0:29:33] <+KingLlama1> Thats why I couldnt play Code Vein ... the circle test was wonky
[0:29:35] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's alright
[0:29:36] <+mydyingparadiselost> Type-C virus is real and closing schools
[0:29:39] <trianglehat> Did Pat just get sick between this stream and CastleSuperBeast?
[0:29:39] <Aydarkzero> Will to Fight is AMAZING
[0:29:42] <+solzan2000> FF13 OST series is amazing

[0:29:54] <%dmtjinni> ooh
[0:29:55] <PabuPanda> I BELIEVE YOU MEAN THE BEST THING ABOUT FF13 IS VANILLE
[0:29:55] <%j0ustar> FF13's music is GREAT. just the music.
[0:29:57] <+TheBitingIrish> I kinda want to start playing FF14 again, but I'm afraid I'll burn out super fast again.
[0:30:00] <mr_gunn> Pog
[0:30:01] <therakishsage> I wonder if Pat would like RE6 if he got good at nailing counters on all of the bioterrors. Not a terribly good RE game, but it's kind of satisfying to melee your way, invincible and untouchable, through hordes of goop monsters.
[0:30:03] <%OToole42> @PatStaresAt a word of advice, in FF7 settings, turn OFF screen shake, that shit gets bad, my wife got physically ill
[0:30:05] <Dragon_Batman> it's as turn based as it can get
[0:30:10] <+TheNewZealandStory> the original ff7 wasnt turn based either though
[0:30:10] <bashful_bard> I mean the game plays itself for you
[0:30:13] <+solzan2000> I like FF13 series F the haters lol
[0:30:15] <%peachy996> Turn Based will be there still tho right?
[0:30:15] <@Fuggins4U> that's why i bathe in beer

[1:19:23] <+Yakobro> LUL
[1:19:24] <%Kataguro> Kataguro subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! As soon as I come in, all I see is Pat smiling like a kid. FF7 hype is very real
[1:19:24] <ShichiNoBushi> FFXIII system.
[1:19:24] <LeeOhX> Its crazy to think Cloud goes from fighting a biped robot to literal FF god
[1:19:25] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:19:26] <%TheWinged7> @Pendragwn ESPECIALLY if they voiced a guy KappaPride
[1:19:26] <vonmaultke> PepeHands this remake makes me want cloud to have a gun build option
[1:19:28] <garbageheaphound> FIRE DOES NOT WORK ON ROBOTS
[1:19:29] <Bagelborn> how does Barret talk in slowmo
[1:19:31] <+Grayhammatter> nice going pat
[1:19:31] <hntronium> PRESSURE THEM ON WAKEUP
[1:19:31] <+NitronStreams> use Stinger to build Stun
[1:19:31] <Finaldragoon> it's the break system from 13
[1:19:32] <Tronodood> Does Barret have the same VA as Balrog/Boxer?
[1:19:32] <suikudo> Its literally the FF13 stagger system
[1:19:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Fire! Does not do anything ! TO ROBOTS!"
[1:19:35] <%spiritofmojave> Ghost of FF13
[1:19:35] <yourliteraldog> barrets got thunder
[1:19:35] <MasterTonberry23> Since remake isnt gonna make it to Aerith's death, I'm guessing they're gonna play the hell outta Jessie's death for similar drama
[1:19:36] <+Antoids> cuz they hear we got stagger
[1:19:36] <%cvp5127> use your shorcuts pats
[1:19:37] <JunkyardCrow> I'm glad they didn't tone down the steampunk-ass enemy designs too much
[1:19:38] <Xelhesia> @PatStaresAt YOU CAN SET MAGIC TO A SHORTCUT ALSO
[1:19:39] <bluebiscuit94> The one good system from FF13

[1:19:52] <+jiggy_snipe> Barret has thunder Pat
[1:19:53] <AddictedGamer_> Did FF15 have a stagger system? I forget. Was that just FF13?
[1:19:54] <tanarath> Pat, Barrett has Bolt & Cure
[1:19:54] <MattoBii> thrust is better for stagger buildup
[1:19:55] <ha2ken> Ooh that combo
[1:19:57] <Aydarkzero> Stagger System from 13 Kreygasm
[1:19:58] <+Corvellia> @PatStaresAt Cloud and Barret have abilities that do extra stagger damage. Good to use when they are pressured to fill that meter real quick
[1:19:58] <quasiplaying> FF7 ED-209 lol
[1:19:59] <cochramd1992> >compared to Umbrella

[1:20:14] <DandyMackeroos> Strange, Cloud came with Bolt originally
[1:20:15] <randominternetsurfer> @memnonv Shinra. I want Scarlet to use me as a chair.
[1:20:15] <try_it_sis_> S T A G G E R E D
[1:20:17] <kingbaconcrispy> Staggering, the only good thing from 13

[1:28:39] <%StrawberryPantsu> @LittleBigQuebec Could be
[1:28:39] <+Corvellia> Just because it is designed by the same person does not mean it is the same. The combos do not feel like kh and the feel of the game is different
[1:28:39] <%PlainSimpleTailor> This chat has turned into the pansiest nerd slapfight ever and I love it.
[1:28:40] <Animorphimagi> Kh Has Zero menuing
[1:28:40] <KaironFortressKnight> it's a cross between Crisis Core and KH
[1:28:40] <AntChodeny> gun > keyblade
[1:28:41] <MetelStar> SourPls
[1:28:41] <%happyface699> This music is great

[1:28:45] <VidulaSaix> Wrong. It does
[1:28:46] <+blkalucard1> in 3 yeah
[1:28:46] <+AbnormalVoid> augh, the track just doesn't have the same kick NotLikeThis
[1:28:47] <rcand9> REALLY
[1:28:47] <Drusain> can't be kingdom hearts because the allies actually do something Kappa
[1:28:48] <BurdRightsActivist> "Use lightning magic" > hits him with everything but magic
[1:28:49] <@SSaryn> It's literally just a command system, not just KH does it
[1:28:50] <usurper_sos> YOOOO

[1:28:51] <%Konquerer> gimme this fucking soundtrack NOW
[1:28:52] <@JustinianKnight> its not even like CC much honestly

[1:28:56] <%TwistedSyN> That's a 4th wall break.
[1:28:59] <%StaceMcGate> ATTACK THE BUTTHOLE
[1:28:59] <bsmusic> I've been playing through kh recently, it's just a slightly different kh2 base
[1:29:02] <+LastHazzerd> you don't have to menu for this hame
[1:29:02] <waffleandman> chat have you played kh lol
[1:29:06] <tdude0175> They took elements from kh and ff15 and braught them together it feels.
[1:29:09] <Neo_Kaiser> KH2 is dumb
[1:29:09] <reonome> i see some snark there
[1:29:10] <$Ziegsy> Every hack and slash game is like KH
[1:29:12] <qo_op> that's afucking ool robot
[1:29:12] <Desertfishing> Hit the GLOWING BUTTHOLE
[1:29:13] <Dragon_Batman> HE means the moving and a button to attack and a menu on the slide deal not the exact feeling
[1:29:17] <LeeOhX> KH can be complex if you let it

[1:29:33] <%GeneralHysterics> Barret's gr8
[1:29:33] <krymzen5> it has a b-hole LUL
[1:29:33] <Warbot40> It's in the middle of action and tactics. This seems like the ideal version of XV's combat
[1:29:33] <ha2ken> A Paige appear
[1:29:34] <yourliteraldog> Death Grips
[1:29:34] <BurdRightsActivist> attack while its TAIL IS UP

[1:29:47] <%Mr_Pylon> Hoi Paige
[1:29:50] <Aydarkzero> kh2 combat is the best
[1:29:50] <DandyMackeroos> Yay Paige
[1:29:52] <%NeroInfinite> Who said that?

[1:29:55] <bluebiscuit94> The core on the ass
[1:29:55] <%the_vedo_show> the bootyhole
[1:29:56] <%skizzuto> the combat director for KH2 worked on this game
[1:29:56] <MayorRev> Hi paige!
[1:29:56] <%KishinGrek> His ass
[1:29:56] <doodledumps> It's not like KH really at all except for the mini menu and single action attack button
[1:29:56] <+AbnormalVoid> Hit it in the butthole
[1:29:57] <bsmusic> I literally just finished kh2 lol
[1:29:57] <@JustinianKnight> people haven't played KH in a while I guess
[1:29:57] <ミュウレ4242> it's using matra magic? fucking throwing curve balls at us.
[1:29:57] <+Caidezes> Chat's just salty for no reason. lmao
[1:29:58] <%crimsonharvest> thats fine tusk it's not full of terrible kh models and animation
[1:29:58] <cochramd1992> when the tail is up
[1:29:59] <MAGNUMB> this is identical to kingdom hearts
[1:29:59] <%Frost_Quill> Attack it's asshole.
[1:30:00] <%thetrashman_sc> chat whats "whos talking" from
[1:30:02] <%Shacklebox> hell yeah
[1:30:02] <LeeOhX> KH2 combat is the best
[1:30:02] <%Nobrev> shoot with barret
[1:30:03] <AntChodeny> KH2 was the last good KH game
[1:30:03] <%Konquerer> stinger it in the asshole
[1:30:03] <Neo_Kaiser> KH2 combat is lame. It's too easy and boring.
[1:30:03] <%wolfofsound> Kreygasm
[1:30:03] <@SSaryn> It's just a command system and not only KH does it.
[1:30:04] <RunningNGunning> KH2FM's combat is amazing in postgame
[1:30:04] <Solidnick18> Kreygasm
[1:30:04] <%patriotrenegade> KNOCK ITS DICK OFF
[1:30:05] <devil_may_cum_> Kh2 is fantastic
[1:30:08] <%Dwarven_Gaming> the combats being designed by the guy who did KH2, so its VERY similiar
[1:30:09] <usurper_sos> Kreygasm
[1:30:09] <shin_marx> I liked kh3, but 2 is the best one
[1:30:10] <+Superstartee> switch to barret
[1:30:11] <DandyMackeroos> Calling KH isn’t an insult
[1:30:12] <+Phoenon> BRING IT
[1:30:13] <%the_vedo_show> atpGasm atpHorns
[1:30:13] <$Ziegsy> I love blonde sora
[1:30:16] <Warbot40> Being made by the same team =/= it feels the same
[1:30:17] <Dragon_Batman> Totally forgot about the butthole, I hit it with magic till the barrier went away
[1:30:18] <dashmatt> robot butthole
[1:30:18] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Chat is turning into the American Choppers argument meme IRT
[1:30:20] <waifoong98> blind LUL
[1:30:21] <jon651> So KH had staggers and pressure?
[1:30:22] <VidulaSaix> The game has a few ideas from KH just like some stuff from 13 as well but the combat system itself is nothing like either of those games. It's just what works from multiple different things combined into one
[1:30:25] <%happyface699> Hard and fast
[1:30:25] <+KDZen> dream drop distance combat Kreygasm
[1:30:30] <%MonsterEnvy> You need Barret to use Thunder magic to stagger it
[1:30:31] <%Jaxnos> don't get your ass beat, Pat
[1:30:31] <%patriotrenegade> Launcher Spider
[1:30:33] <%happyface699> psaWink psaWink psaWink
[1:30:33] <Jolly_Adventurer> @thetrashman_sc Its a joke Paige and Plauge made while watching Star Trek
[1:30:34] <Psykoknight65> no but ff13 had stagger
[1:30:34] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:30:34] <%InugamiTheHound> They copied KH/FF15 gameplay and FF13 with stagger mechanic
[1:30:35] <%ahdurian> im gonna laugh so hard if pat runs out pf potions
[1:30:36] <%MonsterEnvy> THen use ablites
[1:30:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @thetrashman_sc Plauge's Star Trek streams. Joke on Jordie being blind.
[1:30:38] <BurdRightsActivist> it's made by the same TEAM SO IT'S THE SAME GAME KH4
[1:30:42] <$rekinom> Please let us see a tail laser BlessRNG
[1:30:42] <%Dementedpenguin> @PlainSimpleTailor Can't wait for the full playthrough LUL
[1:30:44] <+theodolitejones> USE THUNDER!
[1:30:45] <%crimsonharvest> youre supposed to use lightning to fill the mter right?
[1:30:48] <boomstickery> shoot its butthole
[1:30:49] <%tusk102> @jon651 they mean it in the way it feels to swing clouds sword/menu stuff not "all gameplay is the same"
[1:30:50] <%MonsterEnvy> Use the Thunder magic
[1:30:50] <%thegreenbenis> STAY DOWN ASSHOLE
[1:30:50] <Psykoknight65> @inugamithehound I mean, nomura IS working on this game

[1:30:58] <+Superstartee> more thunder
[1:30:59] <qo_op> i love the smack talk mid fight LUL
[1:30:59] <Ipsenscastle> USE ATB
[1:31:01] <$joylent_blue> its almost like it borrows from many things and just calling it x or y doesn't do it justice
[1:31:01] <+KDZen> great va
[1:31:02] <usurper_sos> Use ether
[1:31:04] <$Ziegsy> I look forward to hearing cid say 'fuck'
[1:31:05] <%Nope80808> They literally Copy and pasted KH2's combat into this. Only took like 3 mintues.
[1:31:05] <%patriotrenegade> use your ATB
[1:31:05] <quasiplaying> SAIGOU NO THUNDA
[1:31:05] <DandyMackeroos> Use Barret Bolt
[1:31:09] <Vivirmos> Hit the triangle to recharge during his recoil from firing
[1:31:09] <+thackattack00> Focus Shot does more stagger
[1:31:09] <Monkeyweed21> pat use your your abilities
[1:31:15] <bluebiscuit94> Use abilities when pressured
[1:31:15] <Japanfreak2595> If Kingdom Hearts played like a Tales of game
[1:31:19] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @Dementedpenguin it'll be the first time for me experiencing the story ever. so I am too
[1:31:20] <SaltyShots> You don't know anything about KH combat till u do level 1 critical

[1:56:08] <+Pandamilker> the difference between 20 and 30 minutes is the septhiroth cutscene at the end.

[2:11:47] <%crimsonharvest> Wedge is the gamer self-insert character
[2:11:49] <%Frost_Quill> So are they siblings or are they gonna kiss before the sector plate glomps them?
[2:11:50] <baesoora> shut up i had a crush on Cloud as a kid :(
[2:11:50] <DXLelouch24> PAT switch to punish mode when attacked to parry you can do it standing ther or mid combo

[2:14:28] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt On second thought them not actually blowing up the reactor makes them living in the city after in all the spinoffs make way more sense.

[2:15:49] <+Prince_Kaboom> lul bork busters
[2:15:55] <+Phoenon> and with Vincent you're just playing Dirge of Cerberus Kappa
[2:15:55] <%crimsonharvest> They wanted them to be different as early as FF6, and tried but only mildly succeeded
[2:15:56] <JunkyardCrow> Tifa will just be God Hand 2
[2:15:56] <wookie5358> Aerith will walk soft and carry a big stick
[2:15:57] <Solidnick18> when is punch girl

[2:16:19] <%crimsonharvest> its a kingdom hearts
[2:16:23] <SaltyShots> Yeah can't wait to play as a magicy bitch
[2:16:24] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt On second thought them no actually blowing up the reactor makes them being accepted back into the city to live in the spinoffs make way more sense.
[2:16:25] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt works for me
[2:16:25] <DandyMackeroos> @rcand9 Don’t you mean Dolphin Blow?
[2:16:28] <Dragon_Batman> Yea
[2:16:28] <%StrawberryPantsu> KH2 is close to Character Action
[2:16:30] <%ssjklyco> Character Action RPG
[2:16:30] <Solidnick18> @rcand9 she just whips her tits to attack ye
[2:16:31] <%thegreenbenis> It's Kingdom Hearts.
[2:16:31] <%Binary_Fireball> someone for the love of God tell me if the game feels good???
[2:16:33] <Coystick> BUTTON BASHER
[2:16:34] <sharpington_> Can't understand Paige, she sounds so far away
[2:16:35] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> It's a WolfenDoom
[2:16:36] <Monkeyweed21> Needs a launcher to be Character action
[2:16:36] <ElenaManetta> sims is an rpg
[2:16:38] <Animorphimagi> NO
[2:16:40] <%Totally_not_toby> it's very kingdom hearts
[2:16:43] <%tusk102> people are mad about it but it super is
[2:16:44] <Solidnick18> Kingdom hearts meh
[2:16:45] <%NovaKnightmare> Yea but with a better story :3c
[2:16:47] <+Remery_> yum
[2:16:47] <+StoicMoogle> Pat make sure to see the moogle medal when you pick it up!
[2:16:48] <bsmusic> Time for chat to get salty LUL LUL
[2:16:48] <+Renkaru> It seems more involved than KH or FF15
[2:16:49] <CrypticMochi> Aerith dance dodges, Tifa has monk positions
[2:16:49] <Monkeyweed21> Kingdom Hearts IS Character Action Pat
[2:16:50] <+loukemia83> We can coin a new term, a FinalHearts
[2:16:50] <wookie5358> It's tactical hearts
[2:16:50] <Sapphire_Breeze> have you PLAYED kingdom hearts?
[2:16:51] <%SeventyForce> Is FF7R going to be SquareEnix's 10 year franchise???
[2:16:53] <+Corvellia> I don't think you guys have played kh2 lately
[2:16:54] <ElenaManetta> KH fighting is tight
[2:16:55] <Zlinnt> PUNCHY KICKY
[2:16:56] <Dutchpotato> It feels like a tactical action rpg
[2:16:56] <ZE_Count> You need jump for it to be a kingdom heart
[2:16:56] <ElenaManetta> i like it
[2:16:56] <%Dementedpenguin> Chat getting mad again at the comparison LUL
[2:16:56] <TastySammiches> its kingdom hearts but with its feet on the ground
[2:16:56] <Zack14thTv> Are you gonna play the full release on the ps4
[2:16:57] <Animorphimagi> NOT AT ALL
[2:16:58] <%Binary_Fireball> does it feel polished???

[2:17:10] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> vargTrash vargTrash vargTrash
[2:17:10] <%tusk102> @Sapphire_Breeze he did, he mentioned playing kh2
[2:17:10] <+flexin_apex> So will yakuza 7 be a JRPG
[2:17:10] <bsmusic> Triggered LUL LUL
[2:17:11] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm not mad about KH, you're just wrong about it being the exact same, cuz it's not.
[2:17:12] <+Remery_> Lewd
[2:17:12] <iwa5h4ck3d> OhMyDog
[2:17:12] <$RetroCop87> ANGRY DONALD NOISES
[2:17:13] <%NovaKnightmare> Barret is the best
[2:17:15] <Aeonknight_87> it's action RPG w/ the option to change it to more RPGish
[2:17:15] <+Renkaru> Cloud is triggered
[2:17:16] <yourliteraldog> Hyuck Hyuck
[2:17:16] <%reneries> Yea thats exactly what Goofy says psaBig
[2:17:17] <%tactician0> HEAL ME DONALD
[2:17:19] <%weissguard> A-HYUCK
[2:17:19] <+HeavyMetalIceCream> Goofy didn't just fuck, he got arround
[2:17:19] <rcand9> it feels better than kh to me ive played kh 1 and it was ok
[2:17:22] <tiaramaki> kzxGoob
[2:17:22] <ambreezy722> Goofy FUCKS
[2:17:23] <Monkeyweed21> Kingdom Hearts is Character Action Pat Donguri made videos on it
[2:17:23] <SaltyShots> yesh the best part is gone
[2:17:24] <+FrenchTact1cs> Barrett is daddy
[2:17:24] <Deadbulky> GAWSH this seems like a good place to find some ingreediants!
[2:17:24] <King_thunder365> Thank you for shitting on Kingdom Hearts, Pat.
[2:17:25] <+cowkid222> each attack is a more deliberate actions than KH, but does greatly feel like it
[2:17:25] <%skizzuto> because he can hear the planet cryin' out in pain
[2:17:26] <wookie5358> I think tactical mode and character swapping differentiates it from kingdom hearts a bit
[2:17:26] <+Zutrax> It's a bit slower and more "flowy" than KH, but I can see the comparisons for sure.
[2:17:26] <%Frost_Quill> I would love it if Sora, Donald, and Goofy showed up and this was all actually an expansion for KH3.
[2:17:26] <+paladinstarbuster> SHIIEET
[2:17:28] <Dragon_Batman> It takes the best things from most of Squares iPs and it turns it into one in this game
[2:17:29] <%tusk102> @flexin_apex it is a jrpg and that makes me sad
[2:17:30] <ZE_Count> Pat hates gay dogs
[2:17:30] <yourliteraldog> GOOFY FUCKED
[2:17:31] <Hellarussian> romance the pixels
[2:17:31] <Dutchpotato> KH2 is my favourite game ever, this feels nothing like kh, it feels great in its own way
[2:17:33] <%marvel877> Jessie wants that Cloud D, but Cloud's like "NO WAY FRIEND."
[2:17:33] <+Pippinitus> Why does her voice sound so familiar?
[2:17:34] <%Totally_not_toby> kzxGoob kzxDoggers kzxDAB kzxDAB kzxDAB kzxDAB kzxDAB
[2:17:37] <TastySammiches> DuckerZ SORA! It's SEPHIROTH!
[2:17:37] <DandyMackeroos> Donald talking about Sephiroth
[2:17:37] <%Faustgesicht> Not as open as my vag tho
[2:17:38] <%WheatlyXT> Why is Cloud a dog
[2:17:39] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Pippinitus futaba
[2:17:41] <wookie5358> But I get why people say KH
[2:17:42] <%skizzuto> I stan with Kingdom Hearts
[2:17:43] <%GeneralHysterics> lol
[2:17:43] <+blkalucard1> preacher
[2:17:45] <%AncelDeLambert> just so long as they got rid of that timer puzzle, I guess
[2:17:46] <%ammobasket> She sounds like the Handler
[2:17:47] <%JVolfram> Imagine what Goofy's face looks like as he nuts
[2:17:48] <%GorboMcDuggins> @PatStaresAt Barret is just Donald from KH
[2:17:49] <TheArrow_> THE BATTLE THEME AHHHHH
[2:17:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> Goofy is the only person in the Disney gang to have a kid outside of Pete
[2:17:55] <tmix1600> Barret is balrog and g combined
[2:17:56] <yourliteraldog> They retconned max though, Perhaps Goofy Fucks.
[2:17:57] <%reneries> She also does the Voice for Futaba in Persona 5
[2:17:58] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> or Cat lady in Spiderman ps4
[2:17:59] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[2:17:59] <Ipsenscastle> It's male Lightning
[2:18:00] <ElenaManetta> cloud looks so fucking good
[2:18:02] <Zlinnt> PogU
[2:18:03] <Hellarussian> make it rain
[2:18:03] <%tusk102> @GorboMcDuggins you are aware that cloud is in kingdom hearts right?
[2:18:03] <CyladeRWBY> SourPls
[2:18:04] <Serge_12> What do u think of FF7R so far?
[2:18:05] <%Frost_Quill> Goofy has canonically nutted inside of a woman at least one time. Think about that.
[2:18:06] <Deadbulky> F
[2:18:08] <+paladinstarbuster> THEESE GUARDS DONT DESERVE THIS
[2:18:10] <Dragon_Batman> She voices Futaba of Persona 5 and Celica from Fire Emblem
[2:18:14] <StarvingPenguinGod> I feel the HYPE Kreygasm
[2:18:18] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, those ones died fast enough
[2:18:19] <saddlezilla1> Pat did you see all of Jesse's dumb lines for Cloud getting zapped??
[2:18:20] <%GorboMcDuggins> @tusk102 but Barret isn't
[2:18:20] <%WhereIsWill> that music drop is legendary Kreygasm

[2:18:39] <Shwepie> When your team mate says, "He's alone, we can take him!" just put your weapons down and surrender, you've already lost the fight.

[2:22:39] <+PanicSwytch> Jessie wants to succ cloud dry
[2:22:42] <%Frost_Quill> So based on how mako energy works are you using a person every time you cast a spell?
[2:22:43] <wookie5358> So glad this isn't a 5 second wait for each turret to take a single shot
[2:22:44] <Ipsenscastle> nice camera

[2:23:34] <%marvel877> That robot sounds like Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from ATHF.
[2:23:35] <+Pyroclase> I thoguht he was a werewolf
[2:23:35] <boomstickery> itll be vamp
[2:23:36] <waifoong98> NotLikeThis
[2:23:36] <Monkeyweed21> HE BETTER HAVE THE GHOST RIDER MOVE
[2:23:40] <jcflyguy> It just needs to be the FF7MA voice actor.
[2:23:40] <%Frost_Quill> I wonder if you can miss Vincent.
[2:23:40] <%j0ustar> and Yuffie will be EXTRA giddy
[2:23:41] <$rekinom> They'll get GAKT to do it, pat
[2:23:43] <%LaughingCatt> He is actually before Cid
[2:23:44] <rcand9> we need edgey vincent
[2:23:46] <saddlezilla1> Is anyone worried that Barret's eventually gonna end up the most boring to play? Specially when the party gets filled out?
[2:23:46] <%PlagueOfGripes> Cid is last
[2:23:47] <Deadbulky> Ntrd by hojo
[2:23:49] <%marvel877> And he'll be voiced by Robert Pattinson.
[2:23:49] <Bladeexe> Wonder if they will change it or keep Steve Blum?
[2:23:50] <DandyMackeroos> That’ll be good
[2:23:53] <Drusain> get hit by laser again

[2:23:57] <+FrenchTact1cs> Vampire cuckold
[2:23:58] <byrneson> I will never be able to take anybody seriously if they say action combat is objectively better than turn based
[2:23:59] <Aydarkzero> i think Yuffie is played by her kh3 va
[2:24:00] <yourliteraldog> @TheFabledAble Thats why they made the model so they have something to masterbate too.
[2:24:01] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Frost_Quill Actually its the opposite. The more you use Materia, it actually grows and eventually duplicates
[2:24:02] <%AncelDeLambert> oh goody
[2:24:03] <Coystick> GIVE ME YOUR BLUE BABY JESSIE
[2:24:08] <ElenaManetta> it hurts everytime you tell this story
[2:24:09] <%crimsonharvest> I always imagined Vincent sounds exactly like D from the 80s
[2:24:09] <TastySammiches> sid is like halfway through the game
[2:24:09] <%InugamiTheHound> cid is last he is in rocket town
[2:24:09] <%ExpressNode> Weren't they the ones who did the Naruto games?
[2:24:09] <ZE_Count> I remember there was so much fan art for Vincent/Yuffie.
[2:24:10] <%FacetiousAF> oh shit cid is last, huh....
[2:24:10] <+nekodelic> LUL
[2:24:10] <Dragon_Batman> Vincent was optional at least
[2:24:11] <%j0ustar> amazing
[2:24:11] <Monkeyweed21> Cosmo Canyon is after the Manor
[2:24:11] <KatabolicRage> to be fair you can put off getting vincent

[2:24:14] <czeekyplays> Yikes

[2:24:14] <$GrugManGetAngryInside> DUDE>.. Cosmo Canyon is gonna be so rad
[2:24:15] <wookie5358> Cid is last in story, but Vincent can be obtained whenever
[2:24:15] <yourliteraldog> Cid lol
[2:24:20] <%Konquerer> vincent and yuffie were optional
[2:24:20] <rcand9> leave cid alone
[2:24:20] <Djinnazz> That was a rumor,they used most of what Cyber connect use.
[2:24:22] <seaechiowai> psaCanada
[2:24:23] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Show Paige the lines
[2:24:23] <%Frost_Quill> I don't remember that but I believe it.
[2:24:24] <%tinyswampthing> I cant wait for that
[2:24:24] <+TheFabledAble> @yourliteraldog BUT THEY HAVE THE BEST FUCKING INTERNET THOUGH. WHY GO THROUGH THE TROUBLE
[2:24:25] <%StrawberryPantsu> Development on 2 is started I'm guessing we'll see part 2 early 2022
[2:24:26] <+Jaysky> He'll be a perfect husband now
[2:24:26] <%wolfofsound> @Katorskay LUL Hivemind futurama
[2:24:28] <DandyMackeroos> Will Yuffie and Vincent still be optional?
[2:24:28] <Deadbulky> Pow right in the kisser!
[2:24:29] <+AbnormalVoid> LUL
[2:24:29] <MasterCosmic> yeah
[2:24:29] <+skeletiddy> Is RedXIII going to sound like Scooby?
[2:24:29] <%spiritofmojave> she's not even his wife is the just as horrible thing LUL
[2:24:30] <+MissMaggety> I wonder if theyre gonna treat Vincent like a main character and not an optional one
[2:24:31] <%Frost_Quill> Oh fuck.
[2:24:32] <%AncelDeLambert> he doesn't lay a hand on Sherra, c'mon
[2:24:32] <Monkeyweed21> Is Cid why Paige loves abusive assholes?
[2:24:32] <Explodincatz> wow pat

[2:24:34] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Yep
[2:24:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> OH GUFCK
[2:24:36] <Hellarussian> one of these days
[2:24:39] <%PlagueOfGripes> domestic violence doesn't need a reason, Pat
[2:24:40] <%Aleate> It was really bad
[2:24:41] <sothatsprettybrutal> we're whalers on the moon
[2:24:41] <jorniev> JUST MAKE HIM TSUNDERE
[2:24:41] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Show Paige the fetish line
[2:24:43] <Burningskull01> they are making Yuffie and Vincent mandatory now
[2:24:43] <wookie5358> They can mix Yuffie in much earlier if they're taking the Wutai War approach
[2:24:43] <+fergberg75> You didnt know??!!
[2:24:45] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt show paige the laser thing
[2:24:46] <ireliaismaiwaifu> she's not even his wife
[2:24:47] <%Frost_Quill> He just wants to help her reach space. FUCK I FEEL BAD JUST TYPING THAT.
[2:24:48] <+mankeyfigh> He does not beat his wife, I went back
[2:24:48] <Dragon_Batman> Probably not great
[2:24:49] <+FrenchTact1cs> Spouse abuse Cid
[2:24:51] <JunkyardCrow> "Not muh wife, just the woman who lives in mah house and loves me."
[2:24:53] <Monkeyweed21> DO THE LASERS PAT
[2:24:53] <%foreverN2dust> Danny Devito is my favorite anime
[2:24:54] <Deadbulky> Run into lazers again pls pat
[2:24:54] <%SolidusRex> Fun fact: the more you ram into the lasers, the more retarded Jessie thinks you are.
[2:24:55] <%wolfofsound> @PatStaresAt flinstones probably
[2:24:57] <DXLelouch24> Sherahs not his wife till the end
[2:24:59] <vonmaultke> Not liking the pull backs so far. Make Avalanche hard terrorists SwiftRage
[2:25:00] <tmix1600> THEY HAVE BUY THE GAME IN PAUSE MENU
[2:25:00] <DandyMackeroos> They did that only because of a joke?
[2:25:00] <MasterCosmic> Domestic abuse was funny back in the day LUL
[2:25:01] <ElenaManetta> You dont need all of Japan to know, just ONE guy
[2:25:03] <rcand9> it was a love tap
[2:25:04] <%jackythefrost> CC2 is great at making things LOOK cool but they suck shit at making gameplay good
[2:25:04] <DuoScratch> EWfie!
[2:25:04] <%nofestu2> its deeply ingrained in their culture
[2:25:05] <+Kyma1020> Just make him a closet sub like how team 4 star did it
[2:25:05] <%marvel877> Not that much beyond BTTF and Futurama reruns.
[2:25:06] <BeefyQueefer> Wifebeating is something that transcends one culture, Pat.
[2:25:06] <Aydarkzero> Yuffie will prob show up early on the second part
[2:25:10] <+rascalrebel> genuinely excited seeing this stuff
[2:25:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> They could make Cid like SUPER fucking drunk
[2:25:11] <Coystick> Let me do you good, Jessie
[2:25:11] <bsmusic> BibleThump
[2:25:11] <+Jake_Protagonist> I mean you can get Yuffie as soon as you leave midgar
[2:25:12] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> no knots for you
[2:25:12] <Dragon_Batman> As far as we know
[2:25:12] <%PlagueOfGripes> on a scale of 1 to 10, how illegal will Yuffie be
[2:25:14] <%tusk102> show paige the lasers
[2:25:15] <DXLelouch24> Yufies part 2 for sure
[2:25:15] <Bladeexe> Right after the mythril caves then.
[2:25:15] <%Fenrirlives> WHAT? DAMMIT
[2:25:15] <%marvel877> He's AI controlled.

[2:25:20] <czeekyplays> So sad :(
[2:25:24] <%AncelDeLambert> they better make the missable characters just as much of a pain to get, don't hand hold
[2:25:24] <rcand9> @PlagueOfGripes 10
[2:25:25] <Coffee_JD> What if you can use him in NG+?
[2:25:26] <DandyMackeroos> @plagueofgripes 11/10?
[2:25:26] <%Dreadlord134> !uptime
[2:25:26] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 25m.
[2:25:29] <+AbnormalVoid> NO
[2:25:30] <+Remery_> Yuffie will be super legal
[2:25:31] <%ammobasket> She's behind the assassination attempt Heidigger mentioned
[2:25:32] <%cureneckbeard> FF7 was back in the day when translators didn't feel the need to be literal. You had those liberal translations of MGS1 and SotN
[2:25:33] <ireliaismaiwaifu> you use him in the building lol
[2:25:33] <%Frost_Quill> I don't remember that.
[2:25:34] <bimjojo> they could totally just move her whole intro to the very start of disk 2
[2:25:36] <Djinnazz> no he doesn't
[2:25:36] <%Frost_Quill> But I believe it.
[2:25:38] <Guardiansaiyan> Cait Sith MAIN
[2:25:40] <%PlagueOfGripes> will Yuffie's shorts actually be buttoned
[2:25:40] <Dutchpotato> 16/10 Kappa
[2:25:41] <+mankeyfigh> @patstaresat He is PLAYABLE
[2:25:41] <%jobbedbone> does she deserve it though?
[2:25:41] <bimjojo> theres nothing that timelocks it iirc
[2:25:41] <%StaceMcGate> Cid never beat Sheera
[2:25:46] <%SolidusRex> NO HE DOESN'T CLOUD
[2:25:48] <%SoFarFetched> Pat you gonna show Paige the "Fetish" voice line?
[2:25:48] <Burningskull01> Cid never beats Shera. He just cusses at her a lot.
[2:25:49] <Hellarussian> she forgot to dry off a can opener
[2:25:50] <%AncelDeLambert> Cid has never laid a hand on Sherra
[2:25:51] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> What can you do?
[2:25:51] <%Dementedpenguin> >_>
[2:25:51] <%SolidusRex> I MEAN PAT
[2:25:54] <codycurry52> gotta beat her
[2:25:54] <Aydarkzero> @PlagueOfGripes they were in kh3 Kappa
[2:25:54] <%derap41> How else is she going to learn
[2:25:54] <Arek_1> LUL
[2:25:55] <a_mad_dragon> THE TEA BITCH
[2:25:56] <Monkeyweed21> Yuffie will join right before Wutai, screw you over in Wutai, then join for real
[2:25:56] <%wolfofsound> only one way to learn
[2:25:57] <%StrawberryPantsu> Needs to stay in the game tbh
[2:25:59] <%ssjklyco> Of course Paige likes the character that beats the woman
[2:26:00] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Cid is actually morally grey
[2:26:00] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> beating her is the only way
[2:26:00] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[2:26:05] <+Remery_> all the midriff will be shown
[2:26:06] <%hrudzie_1> lmao we cracking racist canadia jokes now
[2:26:06] <%spiritofmojave> he verbally abuses her but not sure he does anything physical
[2:26:07] <%PlagueOfGripes> Cid did nothing that Shera didn't MAKE him do, to be fair
[2:26:08] <yourliteraldog> I'm pretty sure tastless jokes about spousal abuse are feature of every cultures comedic repertoire.
[2:26:09] <Deadbulky> Run into lazeeeers
[2:26:10] <%crimsonharvest> what if they pronounce Cait Sith correctly in this version?
[2:26:11] <%StrawberryPantsu> Cid was a piece of shit
[2:26:12] <+NitronStreams> WHAT IF CID IS JUST PAT
[2:26:12] <Dutchpotato> CID is morally grey
[2:26:13] <%jobbedbone> smacking my bitch, let a bitch know
[2:26:17] <$RetroCop87> SIT YOUR ASS DOWN AND DRINK YOUR #$%& TEA
[2:26:17] <%SolidusRex> OH GOD I JUST CALLED PAT CLOUD
[2:26:19] <%LaughingCatt> I hope thats the route they take it
[2:26:21] <DXLelouch24> Yuffie will be 17 and turn 18 in the journey
[2:26:21] <a_mad_dragon> cid isn't hot though
[2:26:21] <Monkeyweed21> THEY BETTER KEEP CLOUD GETTING GANGBANGED AT HONEY BEE
[2:26:21] <Shwepie> @PlagueOfGripes Yuffie would probably be a 4, +2 if shorts are unbuttoned.
[2:26:22] <%AncelDeLambert> Sherra is in to that
[2:26:24] <youlookokgetin> The safe word is masamune
[2:26:24] <Coystick> I'll walk through your park Jessie
[2:26:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> He could be drunk as fuck
[2:26:24] <Guardiansaiyan> @NitronStreams too tall
[2:26:25] <saddlezilla1> Iirc Cid's wife beating wasn't as bad in the orginal Japanese right???
[2:26:25] <%juxtest> He crashed his rocket because he knew if she died in the launch he wouldn't be able to hit her anymore
[2:26:25] <%axellogic> He never physically beat her but he was very vocally abusive
[2:26:26] <%Scottigecko> god Cid is going to be SO HOT
[2:26:28] <rcand9> she loves him really
[2:26:28] <%Mr_Pylon> It gets Cid all porked up
[2:26:29] <Asuxley> oh it's a sub/dom relationship
[2:26:29] <KatabolicRage> I can't wait for the uncensored Cid
[2:26:29] <+nekodelic> Cid is a David Cage character
[2:26:31] <spinningchurro> am i here?
[2:26:31] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @SolidusRex that's right, cloud
[2:26:32] <DandyMackeroos> Probably
[2:26:34] <%vectorless_peon> I saw that FF7 Abbridged refferende
[2:26:35] <%Frost_Quill> I like that the abridged series made it consensual and they're just super kinky.
[2:26:36] <@commanderclaw> She's gonna call Cid daddy when he hits her
[2:26:45] <%AncelDeLambert> wtf why is this here?
[2:26:45] <Deadbulky> I cant wait for fatty to get ISAKIAED by Truckun
[2:26:46] <Coystick> I'll wipe you out Je-wait no
[2:26:49] <+Pyroclase> its arms are just giant 40k bolters
[2:26:51] <Hellarussian> he says as he rushes in
[2:26:53] <+TheFabledAble> thats like 100% abuser 101, overreact and hit someone and scream, then immediately soften and apologize, rinse repeat
[2:26:53] <Zooperton> he says after already rushing in
[2:26:55] <youlookokgetin> "he says while rushing in*
[2:26:57] <ZE_Count> You think they are going to do the whole Phoenix egg thing?
[2:26:58] <%cureneckbeard> metal gear? psaSmug
[2:27:02] <%AncelDeLambert> you mean like how Pat is making you rush in right now?
[2:27:02] <%spiritofmojave> wait if Cid is like in his mid 30's can we possibly see hot Cid like in 14 limesPoggers
[2:27:02] <%wolfofsound> @commanderclaw slight moans
[2:27:06] <%maskofmichael> Team Four Star's FF7 has Cid be into BDSM
[2:27:14] <%ssjklyco> Yuffie will have a Naruto mechanic
[2:27:14] <+FrenchTact1cs> What a silly enemy
[2:27:17] <%InugamiTheHound> oh cool this where I came in for the earlier part of this stream

[2:27:21] <rcand9> will cloud go full wheelchair?
[2:27:29] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt So is Guard Cloud vs Sephiroth going to be a fight in the flashback?
[2:27:30] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt watch them not at all lower cloud hitting aeris and just shows him doing dmc Gilgamesh combos on her
[2:27:30] <%InugamiTheHound> we got ff13 staggered mechanic in this game
[2:27:32] <Monkeyweed21> The stagger mechanic was one of the best parts of FFXIII
[2:27:35] <%jobbedbone> anyone remember that RPG world comic with the cloud and tifa ripoff main characters?
[2:27:38] <sappinmahbinyot> Holy shit thi slooks amazing
[2:27:41] <SaltyShots> yuffie is so hot i hate that shes 16
[2:27:42] <yourliteraldog> Cid the abuser who wants to go to space
[2:27:46] <wookie5358> The stagger is good when done properly
[2:27:52] <+NerevaRising> Use the shortcuts boomer
[2:27:52] <+Pyroclase> Doesn't Xenoblade 2 have that mechanic as well?

[2:31:34] <%Frost_Quill> @InugamiTheHound Wait wasn't Tifa older than Cloud? I thought that was what Cloud's mom's "date an older woman" line was about?
[2:31:37] <%AncelDeLambert> ...Stamp?
[2:31:39] <DandyMackeroos> Everyone talkinf about Jessie thirst but what about Barret thirst?
[2:31:39] <+thackattack00> Yep
[2:31:42] <%wolfofsound> So it's not stampy from teh simpsons?
[2:31:42] <+Cadwae> @Katashi25 Says it is worth stuff to collectors, so probably someone in the market or something

[2:31:55] <%LaughingCatt> @PatStaresAt looks like it could be a childrens show, which means Barret might watch it with Marlene
[2:31:56] <$TheOfficialNeens> Yeah Tifa is older than Cloud

[2:31:59] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt stamp is a shinra mascot

[2:33:41] <DandyMackeroos> Yeh, stun
[2:33:42] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I wonder if we're gonna have a different set of spells starting out in the actual game.
[2:33:44] <Monkeyweed21> I think you can counter the Tail stabs
[2:33:44] <MyNameIsRasus> thanks
[2:33:45] <Aydarkzero> i will say that i don't like boss fights so far with the combat
[2:33:47] <%GoCoSpace> Does this streamer only know how to spam attack? Kappa
[2:33:47] <tanarath> @mynameisrasus This is his second
[2:33:51] <wookie5358> Probably just "slow" @Sphincter_Spelunker
[2:33:51] <yourliteraldog> Will Barret be allowed to drop one N-bomb during the course of the remake?

[2:33:51] <IntrepidEye> WHIFF
[2:33:53] <+rascalrebel> did they make this fight harder for the demo, or is it legit gonna be like this on release?
[2:33:55] <AmaranthSparrow> @heroicspiritavenger yeah and blowjobs are unsatisfying
[2:33:57] <%maskofmichael> @SaltyShots No, KH characters have heart attacks
[2:34:03] <BisoromiBear> attack the weak point for massive damage
[2:34:06] <saddlezilla1> So if the VA is this well directed in Remake, what the hell's going on w/ KH voice direction?
[2:34:07] <%valkuma> HELL YEAH, YOU SEE THE DAMAGE THAT

[2:34:25] <+nekodelic> @Zaphire_Saucypants I would guess not, but I think we would be able to switch materia
[2:34:26] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> this fight is easy, it just looks hard

[2:34:38] <%sporeian94> I wanna pour one out for the FF7 homies who dreamed of remake and died before this
[2:34:38] <IntrepidEye> that attack kicks my ass everytime
[2:34:40] <+Jaysky> With no survivors
[2:34:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Mr T
[2:34:45] <wookie5358> This fight teaches you that you can't FF15 the fights
[2:34:49] <+NitronStreams> This streamer LUL
[2:34:50] <+Cadwae> Pat forget that he has Fire magic?
[2:34:52] <sothatsprettybrutal> i felt like the lockon was kind of ass but maybe i just don't get how it works
[2:35:00] <CurrySauseBandit> You can switch to Barret for that and keep shooting
[2:35:01] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> does this stream only mash r1
[2:35:10] <rcand9> @sporeian94 good point :(
[2:35:15] <Dutchpotato> The game has locks it’s just kinda bad, probably my one complaint
[2:35:18] <+FrenchTact1cs> Hopefully there is a hard mode
[2:35:18] <Dutchpotato> Lock on*
[2:35:19] <+nekodelic> @sporeian94 damn dude, that legit hit me in the feels :(
[2:35:21] <yourliteraldog> @sporeian94 PJSalt PJSalt for the homes
[2:35:22] <Monkeyweed21> You can counter the jumps and tail stabs
[2:35:26] <absentking> i ran into an audio bug araound her anyone else?
[2:35:27] <%Katashi25> .......why is there a tire on the front of the Scorpion Sentinel?
[2:35:28] <%ospreyworks> How is it?
[2:35:36] <codycurry52> @sporeian94 F
[2:35:39] <%marvel877> And later on I'm just gonna watch Max play this on his stream later on. I'm not sleeping I guess.
[2:35:40] <+Pyroclase> @Katashi25 it's its spare tire
[2:35:43] <%Mr_Pylon> Pat what it goes to the wall you can shoot it with Barret
[2:35:46] <DandyMackeroos> Is Barret gonna shit talk
[2:35:47] <CrypticMochi> I remember Max saying the bosses stay challenging
[2:35:47] <%Mr_Pylon> Yay!
[2:35:52] <SaltyShots> people are going to over simplify this game just like they do with kingdom hearts by saying you just mash one button
[2:35:52] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @sporeian94 they're with the berserk boys who never saw Casca healed
[2:35:53] <+Corvellia> @Katashi25 So he can go vroom real fast
[2:35:54] <AmaranthSparrow> @heroicspiritavenger yeah, a dynamic full orchestral arrangement that shifts depending on the fight is totally inferior to the PS1 sound chip.
[2:35:59] <yourliteraldog> Kiss my ASS
[2:35:59] <DandyMackeroos> Yep, Barret shit talked the clamped Cloud
[2:36:01] <SaltyShots> which will make me sad
[2:36:05] <wookie5358> This came out as I was laying down for bed last night, so I know that feeling @marvel877
[2:36:06] <Dragon_Batman> MAgic and bullets with a bit of hopes
[2:36:08] <+heroicspiritavenger> @CrypticMochi Gotta artificially lengthen the game somehow
[2:36:10] <MyNameIsRasus> I love shepherd Barret
[2:36:13] <yourliteraldog> I love barrets shit talk
[2:36:16] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Not that this is super important but on the age thing, yes, Tifa is a year younger than Cloud and Aerith is a year older than Cloud. There's also dialogue from Cloud's mother during the Nibelheim flashbacks where he remembers her saying "You should date an older girl, one that will take care of you", which all the Aerith stans latch on to saying SEE SHE'S THE CHOSEN ONE, because Tifa is younger. So yeah. 👍

[2:36:32] <seaechiowai> 🤔
[2:36:33] <%logoth_> *only looking
[2:36:41] <%ExpressNode> I feel like they need to make the AOE on that attack smaller because when I'm cloud and I try to roll I before the attack it still hits
[2:36:42] <%ssjklyco> Where does Barret keep all this bullets
[2:36:50] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> so proud of Pat for using Ethers

[2:37:00] <+Ell1ot> Bullets are stored in the balls
[2:37:00] <Aydarkzero> his blood his his bullet supply Kappa
[2:37:02] <%masked_hero_lucky> They're made of magic
[2:37:02] <Viaquez> he keeps the bullets in his enemies
[2:37:03] <wookie5358> Attack while the tail's up!
[2:37:05] <+EdHeng> His glasses gives him infinite ammo
[2:37:07] <%GinAndRoses> his body creates bullets
[2:37:07] <TastySammiches> he should really have a bandolier or something
[2:37:09] <Monkeyweed21> Barrets not a Cyborg all black people can do this stuff
[2:37:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> He doesn't shooot bullets he shoots the truth!
[2:37:10] <Chaoko99> ATTACK WHILE THE TAIL'S UP
[2:37:10] <iwa5h4ck3d> Dont get hit 4Head
[2:37:10] <Dragon_Batman> @moshvik Kinda, there are people that legitimately might not know
[2:37:11] <%wolfofsound> they are rage of africa bullets
[2:37:12] <%tusk102> magic bullets
[2:37:13] <%logoth_> Nice of the tank to give you cover
[2:37:14] <%masked_hero_lucky> They FFXIV Machinist bullets
[2:37:14] <+nekodelic> bullets are stored in the balls
[2:37:17] <+Pyroclase> I'm so disappointed by the lack of "attack while its tail is up"
[2:37:18] <tdude0175> He get's it from the planet when it cries out to him
[2:37:20] <+EmotionalFatGuy> tifa's boobs are hollow. It's all bullet storage
[2:37:22] <Shastafield> 4Head
[2:37:24] <%AncelDeLambert> any day now, game
[2:37:24] <+Remery_> the bullets are stored in the balls
[2:37:27] <%Katashi25> @patstaresat try the gernades
[2:37:30] <TigerClaws12> can you parry the jump?
[2:37:33] <sothatsprettybrutal> this boss theme is kinda meh
[2:37:35] <moshvik> @wookie5358 @Dragon_Batman Honestly all Im gonna say is.... I just want to see some squats again
[2:37:35] <AmaranthSparrow> @heroicspiritavenger yeah, you're right, your "it sucks" is such a thoughtful criticism, i totally get your points. Very eloquent.
[2:37:36] <+heroicspiritavenger> @CollinsOfBodom Not planning on buying it, you all can beta test this shit
[2:37:37] <DandyMackeroos> The bullets are magic
[2:37:42] <%marvel877> Use Limit Break.
[2:37:45] <%sporeian94> I hope Tifa still calls Barrett a "retard" in remake
[2:37:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @EmotionalFatGuy Tiffa's Guns don't require bullets
[2:37:46] <DuoScratch> Pat, look for the EMP Field prompt!
[2:37:47] <%NeroInfinite> limitu breaku
[2:37:49] <tdude0175> You should be able to parry all physical attacks
[2:37:50] <%Ranryu692> @EmotionalFatGuy that's amazing
[2:37:51] <%barkon345> barkon345 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 7 month streak! 
[2:37:53] <%axellogic> Barret eats bullets as a snack then they eenter his bloodstream and are sent to his arm in complicated system thats too hard to explain but dont worry Barret's gotchu
[2:37:59] <%logoth_> The boss theme is very up its own ass with its orchestral pretense
[2:38:02] <+FrenchTact1cs> Questing ammo but all this other shit checks out lol
[2:38:04] <Chaoko99> like lord saddler @axellogic
[2:38:10] <rcand9> the music hits at the perfect moments makes this feel so much better
[2:38:10] <%GoCoSpace> @heroicspiritavenger shhh I'm trying to watch the game here
[2:38:10] <Dragon_Batman> @moshvik Squats are around for shure, from who is another question tho
[2:38:13] <%FacetiousAF> and then pat got a game over Jebaited
[2:38:18] <waifoong98> @logoth_ yeah it tried way too fucking hard
[2:38:19] <+heroicspiritavenger> @AmaranthSparrow You want me to break down music? How about the fact that the composition has no goddamn punch and is flaccid
[2:38:21] <%CollinsOfBodom> @heroicspiritavenger good, leave the clearly shitty bad game to us losers ;)
[2:38:24] <%FacetiousAF> its like the safi jiva
[2:38:25] <+AcrutaLao> "Oh this is the time to heal" Doesn't heal
[2:38:25] <%peachy996> @logoth_ is that not how FF scores are nowadays
[2:38:30] <Coystick> Imagine if Barret wore an ammo drum like Vulcan Raven
[2:38:34] <%Mr_Pylon> Limit up
[2:38:38] <%SoFarFetched> Hey remember we gotta be nice here people psaWink
[2:38:38] <MyNameIsRasus> God I missed Final Fantasy
[2:38:41] <Onamar> You can BLOCK
[2:38:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[2:38:42] <moshvik> @Dragon_Batman Honestly Crisis_Core will probably remain one of my favorite FF games
[2:38:43] <Zombrocom> Barret's name is just bullet mispronounced. This gives him the power of infinite bullets.
[2:38:44] <boomstickery> erry time
[2:38:47] <%marvel877> You have Limit Break, Pat.
[2:38:49] <+Corvellia> Remember when Final Fantasy was good guys?
[2:38:50] <wookie5358> Blocking disabled!
[2:38:51] <%chambatron> I feel the pulse wave attack is kinda cheap too fast
[2:38:51] <%StrawberryPantsu> That dodge roll is worthless
[2:38:55] <Monkeyweed21> Barret
[2:38:55] <Dutchpotato> @acrutalao u need atb to heal
[2:38:57] <Vikbosss> Ультуй Пат
[2:39:01] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> hey chat, keep it down, will ya
[2:39:04] <MyNameIsRasus> Limit Break his ass
[2:39:05] <Dragon_Batman> @moshvik That's fair, Zack is the best part of that game
[2:39:05] <%peachy996> But if Barret had Barry's Magnum
[2:39:07] <$floralkami> @coystick technically, his arm those have a mag Insertion point
[2:39:11] <%ssjklyco> That Streamer would have finished this fight by now
[2:39:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> can u block?
[2:39:19] <+AbnormalVoid> @PatStaresAt it seems like it's more for repositioning
[2:39:19] <%FacetiousAF> why dodge when you can parry
[2:39:21] <%SoFarFetched> Think he did a parry earlier
[2:39:23] <+Corvellia> @DesuDesuDokiDoki Yes, R1
[2:39:23] <%StrawberryPantsu> Like even 15 got its dodge roll right
[2:39:24] <CurrySauseBandit> If it was better you'd never block.
[2:39:24] <SaltyShots> we are just spoiled by Yoko shimomura
[2:39:24] <+thackattack00> I dont think I successfully dodged a single attack when I played
[2:39:27] <czeekyplays> I found the dodge to be pretty useless
[2:39:29] <%GoCoSpace> AngriestPat could do this without wasting all his consumables
[2:39:31] <iwa5h4ck3d> LUL
[2:39:32] <boomstickery> hahahahahahaha
[2:39:33] <+EdHeng> HAHAHAHA
[2:39:34] <sothatsprettybrutal> ha
[2:39:35] <+superkeaton> LUL
[2:39:35] <Explodincatz> HA
[2:39:35] <%logoth_> EM field has long active frames
[2:39:36] <%blademaster247> Cloud's movement feels very stiff to me. Though that may just be because Sora's movement is insane in KH3
[2:39:37] <%sporeian94> Limit Break!
[2:39:37] <+metalsiren31> Jebaited
[2:39:37] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Kh2 vargDorf
[2:39:39] <%chambatron> AngriestPat would have not been hit during this fight
[2:39:39] <+NitronStreams> BIG CLIMBO
[2:39:43] <tdude0175> You can dodge two times in a row but the timing is a little tight
[2:39:43] <$floralkami> there's a little stick on the side of Barrett's arm, that I'm sure are his clips
[2:39:48] <boomstickery> limit break his butt core
[2:39:49] <Drusain> got it memorized?
[2:39:50] <DandyMackeroos> Oh boy
[2:39:51] <+Pandamilker> the most active of frames
[2:39:51] <sothatsprettybrutal> h u n k e r d o w n
[2:39:51] <%NeroInfinite> How did do so wellt he first timeb ut are fucking up NOW? LUL
[2:39:52] <seaechiowai> @zombrocom Barrett is named after the firearm company
[2:39:53] <MyNameIsRasus> CUMBO BIG STUMBO
[2:39:57] <moshvik> @Dragon_Batman Zack has a character is so much fun, but I tihnk the main issue is that it's my first FF7 game and it's like I started the story with the prequel and I've never actually played FF7
[2:39:59] <%InugamiTheHound> got it memorized!
[2:40:03] <%Frost_Quill> I tabbed out to watch youtube videos when this started since I thought he'd do it fast this time.
[2:40:09] <+heroicspiritavenger> Ot
[2:40:10] <%SoFarFetched> YOU PICKED CLOUD AGAIN LUL
[2:40:11] <+EdHeng> Barrett is DYING
[2:40:14] <wookie5358> Overconfidence
[2:40:18] <%j0ustar> You got cocky that's what happened
[2:40:19] <+NitronStreams> BARRET AT RISK
[2:40:21] <Coffee_JD> pat is racist confirmed
[2:40:24] <iwa5h4ck3d> not healing Barrett FeelsBadMan
[2:40:26] <DuoScratch> Poor crazy Barret...
[2:40:27] <%marvel877> How about healing Barret, Pat.
[2:40:28] <%chambatron> Ypu healed cloud twice and barret is dying
[2:40:32] <Chaoko99> I like how Barett's remake design has a suspicious cloth bag covering where the gun is on his arm, as if it's covering something horrible.
[2:40:34] <%NeroInfinite> PAt barret
[2:40:34] <Zombrocom> @seaechiowai That does make more sense. Obviously, Barrett supplies him.
[2:40:34] <Vikbosss> Heal Brorret plz BibleThump
[2:40:35] <%Aleate> I can't believe Barret is fucking gonna die...
[2:40:35] <+linSP> barret nooo
[2:40:37] <%apostateCourier> At the end of Barret's rapid fire (holding square), pressing triangle with good timing will reload much faster than just pressing triangle on its own!
[2:40:44] <+EdHeng> maybe we can see that phoenix down animation
[2:40:44] <+NitronStreams> No heal for Barret ALL FOR CLUMBO
[2:40:45] <+AcrutaLao> Black man dies on white man's stream :(
[2:40:50] <+heroicspiritavenger> It's a shame that all that matters any more is visual fidelity, and not actually making engaging games.
[2:40:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Barret died on my playthrough and it took me like twenty minutes and all my potions to solo it with cloud
[2:40:52] <MyNameIsRasus> BIG DAMAGE
[2:40:55] <Aydarkzero> health gated LUL
[2:40:55] <Monkeyweed21> Pat doesn't waste consumables on Black people
[2:41:07] <rcand9> yikes
[2:41:08] <%tizz86> @sofarfetched after failing the first time i realized this boss is a tutorial on switching and atb management

[2:41:32] <+Corvellia> @heroicspiritavenger I mean I thought it was pretty fun
[2:41:33] <Vikbosss> GET FUCKED
[2:41:43] <sothatsprettybrutal> i like how even though it's a robot it gets a green Cure aura
[2:41:44] <%tactician0> someone bop this clown
[2:41:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Used them all
[2:41:47] <MyNameIsRasus> SOMEBODY'S GETTING FUCKED
[2:41:52] <SaltyShots> damn
[2:41:57] <%FacetiousAF> WHO WHO GIT FUCKY
[2:41:59] <%FacetiousAF> fuckt
[2:42:00] <Dragon_Batman> @moshvik While I do think Release order is the best way to get into something, doing Crisis Core 1st isn't too bad either. I started on DMC3 and that was a prequel.
[2:42:01] <+Tunamanguy> dam this game pretty
[2:42:03] <Zombrocom> No no you don' get it guys, it's new and shiny therefore it sucks because it's not the old thing Kappa
[2:42:06] <+AbnormalVoid> shit the bomb
[2:42:09] <%Mr_Pylon> Now lame it out and see if there's a game over
[2:42:12] <%sporeian94> SOMEONE SENT US THE BOMB
[2:42:14] <%InugamiTheHound> wow for T rated game they use the word "shit" a lot
[2:42:15] <+heroicspiritavenger> @Corvellia Enjoy your artificially difficult lengthened bosses to pad out a game then
[2:42:16] <SweepTheLegoMyEggo> why does the bomb have speakers?
[2:42:18] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> @PatStaresAt Do you think you'll be able to grind for levels in this?
[2:42:18] <%peachy996> Cloud is very pretty
[2:42:21] <Viaquez> let's mosey
[2:42:26] <Chaoko99> I bet Cloud's top is so soft
[2:42:28] <+Corvellia> @heroicspiritavenger How are they artificially difficult?
[2:42:33] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> lets try NOT to save Jessie
[2:42:34] <@Moobot> Hey, check out Curse of the Dead Gods! It's cool! Use this link! bit.ly/2Ry5IeB
[2:42:37] <boomstickery> you left our retreat cover...to wedge?
[2:42:39] <Chaoko99> like cloud's top is like a sweater
[2:42:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> shut up moobot
[2:42:40] <Monkeyweed21> Cloud hears voices in his head, Barret hears "voices"
[2:42:42] <MyNameIsRasus> @SweepTheLegoMyEggo Don't your bombs have speakers?
[2:42:43] <+linSP> kill jesster
[2:42:45] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> SEMPAI NOTICED ME!
[2:42:46] <+rascalrebel> you get so little gil as rewards now
[2:42:47] <moshvik> @Dragon_Batman I'm just hoping that FF7 Remake will be an adequate way to experience the game. I'm thinking maybe I should wait for all the parts to release
[2:42:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Cut to wedge sleeping in the way and the guards can't get around him
[2:42:55] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt now to sit and talk to chat for 30 mins to see what happens if you fail to leave
[2:42:57] <%sporeian94> well I want to know is there going to be transfers at between part 1 and 2
[2:43:00] <%wolfofsound> MrDestructoid MrDestructoid
[2:43:00] <+EdHeng> ah damn Cloud is going to be so big whenever Pat has a break
[2:43:00] <silverira> !uptime
[2:43:01] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 43m.
[2:43:02] <@CoalSavoie> Sounds like Berzerk
[2:43:02] <rcand9> @heroicspiritavenger must feel bad to dislike something everyone likes must hate the wire
[2:43:02] <wookie5358> The analysis menu has item drops and steals; you don't have those in a game without an option to grind
[2:43:06] <Vikbosss> Pat 20 min timer will get extra vide in the end
[2:43:06] <+Remery_> Become as Gods
[2:43:06] <BeefyQueefer> i hope cid has wifebeating side missions
[2:43:07] <%StrawberryPantsu> Shame all of Square Enix's other franchisees are dead outside of FF and DQ
[2:43:11] <+heroicspiritavenger> @Corvellia There's no point to have sequences when you hide behind fuck rubble and multiple phases in a game that is an action rpg. That made sense in the original game, it doesn't here at all.
[2:43:14] <+linSP> at least he's not SUPER emo like in KH
[2:43:15] <+Pixel_Matt> rooBot rooBot rooBot rooBot rooBot
[2:43:17] <tdude0175> Can you run away from fights?
[2:43:18] <%StrawberryPantsu> Would be nice to have a new Front Mission
[2:43:20] <ape_hawk> does this make pat peepee hard?
[2:43:21] <%ssjklyco> Sure
[2:43:21] <Djinnazz> Looks like your lvl progress carries over on demo replays.
[2:43:25] <King_thunder365> @Vikbosss Don't worry, he already saw that in his 1st run
[2:43:31] <Guardiansaiyan> @tdude0175 I am sure you could but WHY?!
[2:43:32] <%sporeian94> like do levels, gil, materia, etc carry over. how does that work since the next part is going to for sure be on PS5
[2:43:32] <kingbaconcrispy> @Chaoko99 Yes I'm sure Coud is very soft, oh you meant is clothes.
[2:43:32] <+thackattack00> >only turn based games should have phases

[2:43:49] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> You're not Paige, don't kill woman
[2:43:49] <+Pyroclase> @Djinnazz nah, you just start at level 6 for some reason
[2:43:49] <%Wrashis> you only could in the original
[2:43:50] <wookie5358> Can't kill Jessie. 0/10
[2:43:51] <czeekyplays> Jessie best girl
[2:43:52] <DandyMackeroos> Oh noo
[2:43:52] <TastySammiches> I mean it was the same in the original
[2:43:53] <MyNameIsRasus> Jesse is fucking thirsty in this version
[2:43:53] <%j0ustar> That one guy in the chat is doing very bad takes
[2:43:53] <FrostyStreamTV> the rock ontop of her is foreshadowing
[2:43:53] <%sporeian94> JESSIE WANTS THE PENIS
[2:43:55] <+Corvellia> @heroicspiritavenger They're clearly trying to mimic the mechanic from the original. Would you rather it sit still while you stare at it because its tail is up?
[2:43:55] <Coystick> I'll dick a girl out, Jessie
[2:43:55] <vonmaultke> GOOD
[2:43:56] <Dragovus> You must save the thirsty girl
[2:43:57] <tiaramaki> B u t t h o u m u s t
[2:43:58] <ShichiNoBushi> Sploosh!!
[2:44:00] <%peachy996> You can't kill Jessie yet.
[2:44:00] <%tizz86> @djinnazz the disclaimer says nothing will carry over i thought
[2:44:00] <Vikbosss> Kreygasm
[2:44:04] <Chaoko99> @kingbaconcrispy I meanl ook at it, it's like a sweater and shit. It looks so warm
[2:44:04] <%GoCoSpace> Question for the chat? Fuck cloud or have cloud fuck you? 🤔
[2:44:04] <+Remery_> Sploosh
[2:44:04] <Dutchpotato> @heroicspiritavenger yeah except you’re supposed to swap to barret after u get behind cover so u can shoot the boss while being safe, it’s called strategy
[2:44:05] <PortableBoredom> @heroicspiritavenger Man, you must hate video games.
[2:44:05] <MemnonV> save jessie with your dick
[2:44:08] <%thegreenbenis> SPLOOSH
[2:44:10] <StarvingPenguinGod> I like video game stuff GivePLZ
[2:44:12] <+EmotionalFatGuy> If you leave Jessie behind then Tidus becomes the main character so save her
[2:44:13] <%j0ustar> Jessie why are you the best dammit
[2:44:13] <%peachy996> You don't blow your money kill on the Demo
[2:44:14] <Monkeyweed21> Give Jessie some dick vape
[2:44:14] <Coystick> I'll come that way, Jessie
[2:44:17] <12bfaught> @heroicspiritavenger I've seen streamers get fucked at every phase of the boss so artificial it ain't
[2:44:22] <+Corvellia> @heroicspiritavenger You're angry at mechanics
[2:44:24] <+heroicspiritavenger> @Corvellia It's just homaging shit to homage shit, instead of fully re-imagining something. If you're gonna do an action game, just fucking make an action game
[2:44:29] <MrIntake> yea LULW
[2:44:31] <+Over_ninek> Cloud: I'm not stopping to ask for directions!
[2:44:32] <%foreverN2dust> LOL
[2:44:32] <Drusain> yes
[2:44:33] <+Pyroclase> Can you explain that more?
[2:44:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @peachy996 yeah kill her with this buster sword
[2:44:34] <+thackattack00> It is an action game though
[2:44:34] <+shyvoid> @GoCoSpace why not both vineThink
[2:44:34] <Djinnazz> @tizz86 No, i mean replaying the demo carries over. not the main game.
[2:44:35] <+Corvellia> @heroicspiritavenger Would you rather them have no mechanics?
[2:44:35] <yourliteraldog> Now I do
[2:44:38] <Monkeyweed21> BUT LIGHTNING'S HAIR THO
[2:44:38] <InugamiTheHound> Jessie is thirsty for Cloud and squall's dick

[2:44:46] <Baeltyr> push her up the ladder?
[2:44:47] <Dragon_Batman> @moshvik I personally wouldn't recommend that partly because it would be really hard to not get hit with anything spoiler related for the 4 years it might take for all 3 to be out. Although you can any way.
[2:44:47] <DingusMcBaseball> nice view huh cloud

[2:44:49] <+BurkeBigsby> Lightning needed more face textures to emote good.
[2:44:50] <%GoCoSpace> @shyvoid Kreygasm
[2:44:50] <sharpington_> face inside ass
[2:44:50] <%derap41> Right up in there
[2:44:51] <FrostyStreamTV> jessie is getting what she wnats
[2:44:51] <AstratesticoMan> schtinky
[2:44:51] <%marvel877> FFXIII, the hallway game.
[2:44:51] <waifoong98> BRAPPPP Kappa
[2:44:52] <Aydarkzero> Kappa
[2:44:52] <%Dementedpenguin> Literally up the ass
[2:44:53] <+linSP> IN THERE
[2:44:53] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> GET UP IN THERE CLOUD
[2:44:53] <%FacetiousAF> come to think of it, how many "towns" are there in ff7? 10?
[2:44:54] <AmaranthSparrow> @heroicspiritavenger I don't understand what you're saying, since when was there hiding behind rubble in the original version of this fight?
[2:44:54] <CamiHeart> Right in da booty
[2:44:55] <%maskofmichael> Cloud, right up the ass
[2:44:55] <Drusain> stop sniffing jessie's butt
[2:44:56] <tiaramaki> Which is weird because you had X - XII happening with whole towns and cities
[2:44:56] <MrIntake> i smell it Kreygasm
[2:44:57] <%damienlunas> LIKE GROCERIES
[2:44:58] <DandyMackeroos> You guys should probably stop engaging that one man who’s mad at the game to be mad
[2:44:59] <%StrawberryPantsu> To be fair Crystal Tools was pretty bad
[2:44:59] <%thegreenbenis> BRAAAAAAAAAP
[2:44:59] <ireliaismaiwaifu> cloud eating ass on stream
[2:45:00] <ZE_Count> SSNIFFF
[2:45:03] <yourliteraldog> Lightning returns
[2:45:04] <kingbaconcrispy> She wants you to climb in her butt
[2:45:04] <+Remery_> sniff xD
[2:45:05] <%jessedouglas> enter the jess ass
[2:45:05] <Dutchpotato> @heroicspiritavenger I’m very sorry u can just mash square to beat the boss, maybe try easy mode next time :)
[2:45:10] <%StrawberryPantsu> Game barely ran on PS3/60
[2:45:13] <%Sneakman98> HAHAHAHA
[2:45:14] <czeekyplays> I TELL EM
[2:45:15] <%ssjklyco> Jessie sounds like she's on Cloud 9
[2:45:15] <%spiritofmojave> YOUUUU
[2:45:16] <ThDark> Soulja Boy?
[2:45:16] <+ciprofloxacin> soulja boi TELL 'EM
[2:45:17] <wookie5358> Accepting their proprietary engine sucks balls and ditching it for UE was the best move ever
[2:45:19] <TastySammiches> YOOOU
[2:45:20] <pootybutt1> I didn't find wrangling all the diffrent menu options and cloud's stances and shit very fun in the boss fight
[2:45:21] <pulser0> tell em
[2:45:21] <DingusMcBaseball> ex- soulja boy
[2:45:22] <Chaoko99> YOUUUU
[2:45:23] <%peachy996> Oh guys Remember Soulja Boy?
[2:45:24] <%blademaster247> Barrett should really save those cutscene bullets that can one-shot enemies
[2:45:24] <EscourtMission> Soulja Boy up in this!
[2:45:24] <%Kilagn> TELL'EM
[2:45:24] <%Binary_Fireball> CLOUD'S HAIR IS TOO SMALL
[2:45:26] <vonmaultke> Soulija boi
[2:45:27] <%wolfofsound> @ssjklyco LUL
[2:45:29] <iwa5h4ck3d> Cloud uses the Soulja game console?
[2:45:30] <%peachy996> He used to exist
[2:45:30] <King_thunder365> SUPAMAN THAT HO
[2:45:31] <Bladeexe> YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!
[2:45:33] <saddlezilla1> UP IN IT OHHHHHHHHH
[2:45:34] <%InugamiTheHound> it makes sense in storyline they can't use towns in ff13 but it was dumb that all shops were only in the save point
[2:45:34] <MyNameIsRasus> Lightning returns was an alright game if you ignored literally everything about its plot and characters
[2:45:36] <yourliteraldog> YOUUUU
[2:45:37] <pootybutt1> Worried all the boss fights will be like that
[2:45:37] <ape_hawk> need a light
[2:45:39] <Guardiansaiyan> @blademaster247 but what if he needs them LATER?!
[2:45:40] <Coystick> "Need a light" niiiiiiiiiiiiiiice
[2:45:42] <Vikbosss> SOLDIER boi
[2:45:42] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> FF7 remake coming to the Soulja Boy console
[2:45:43] <%LaughingCatt> Of course he has one liners
[2:45:43] <rcand9> SONICS ARMS ARENT BLUUUUU
[2:45:43] <+BurkeBigsby> So anyone know if this feels better than FF15's wonky ass combat?
[2:45:45] <Explodincatz> i remember Firebats
[2:45:46] <%peachy996> How old is Soulja Boi
[2:45:46] <DuoScratch> I miss SOLDIER BOLT!
[2:45:48] <+shyvoid> watch me crank that watch me rolllll
[2:45:49] <yourliteraldog> CRANK THAT SOUJA BOI
[2:45:49] <+Corvellia> @heroicspiritavenger You can beat the boss pretty quick if you're good I really don't get your argument. I don't see any artificial lengthening. It's not like it has 1 million hp and 2 moves, it has a rotation it goes through that you can learn and strategize against
[2:45:49] <Aydarkzero> @MyNameIsRasus sounds like every ff game i play
[2:45:51] <+Eclipseon> They're also bad one liners, so it's great.
[2:45:53] <%Quikanims> god cloud thinks he is so cool
[2:45:54] <+Andrizzleton> SOLDIER boy off in this OH!
[2:45:57] <ZE_Count> use grenade
[2:45:57] <iamtheTwitchghost> man i hope the one liners change after a certain point in the game
[2:45:59] <IntrepidEye> Well he is a fuckin dork trying to be cool
[2:46:04] <yourliteraldog> Superman
[2:46:04] <pootybutt1> I just wanna see how old midgar is realized, in all it's dumpy hellhole glory
[2:46:05] <%InugamiTheHound> @MyNameIsRasus I never played lighting returns. I've played 13 and 13-2(I love 13-2 so much)
[2:46:05] <PortableBoredom> @MyNameIsRasus And it's gameplay. And everything else about it. If you threw sand in your eyes and went outside, it was pretty good!
[2:46:05] <+heroicspiritavenger> @Dutchpotato The only action games you can mash Square in are games made by Square-Enix like Kingdom Hearts 3. Real good games made by Capcom and Platinum are actually using this genre to effective use.
[2:46:05] <wookie5358> It's infinitely better than 15. Especially the pre-royal edition
[2:46:07] <Guardiansaiyan> @BurkeBigsby its better...Cloud swings the sword when you press the button...loads better already
[2:46:09] <%peachy996> I live for the day when Soulja Boi is considered Soulja Boomer
[2:46:09] <moshvik> @Dragon_Batman I mean it's still a pretty old game any spoiler I wasn't spoiled on already. More about seeing it with all that new coat of paint
[2:46:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> So does barret Earlier he said "Do I hear THUNDER" when he casted thunder
[2:46:12] <Coystick> He's the kinda dork that would be cool if he wasn't TRYING to be cool.
[2:46:15] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Pat, you're focusing too much on Cloud
[2:46:26] <%logoth_> God the music is so forgettable
[2:46:33] <+heroicspiritavenger> @logoth_ Thank you
[2:46:34] <pulser0> i've only played ff15 CoolStoryBob
[2:46:34] <Chaoko99> I like it.
[2:46:38] <%StrawberryPantsu> @heroicspiritavenger Play KH on Crit and try to mash
[2:46:39] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I also like the music
[2:46:42] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> I heard that different moves will come from weapons as well as materia
[2:46:44] <Chaoko99> But yeah orchestral soundtrack
[2:46:46] <tanarath> @coystick That is literally the point.
[2:46:47] <+wvuboii> Tifa kinda looks like original RE1 Rebecca from opening cutscene
[2:46:50] <Chaoko99> gotta make it look cinematic
[2:46:55] <wookie5358> If some people are saying the music is way too over the top and some are saying forgettable, I think it hit a nice medium
[2:46:56] <%InugamiTheHound> also they changed the name of "bolt" to thunder in this game now
[2:46:58] <AmaranthSparrow> @heroicspiritavenger lol yeah sure, mash your way through all the extra bosses in KH games
[2:47:04] <%peachy996> Music is 10 times better than re6 and the one obnoxious theme on loop
[2:47:05] <%logoth_> Tifa let me smash. Please.
[2:47:06] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> so buster sword has stinger but hardedge will have something else
[2:47:07] <tanarath> Cloud is SUPPOSED to be that terrible.
[2:47:08] <+heroicspiritavenger> @StrawberryPantsu Anything can be difficult if you need to play on Dante Must Die
[2:47:09] <%tizz86> jessie
[2:47:11] <Aydarkzero> i've played 7, (forgot everything after disc 1 and didn't beat it) 10, 13,13-2 and 15
[2:47:12] <%marvel877> Jessie
[2:47:15] <Monkeyweed21> Does Cloud have a Benis or a Bussy?
[2:47:15] <Zombrocom> As someone who never played the original, the remake music seems fine to me
[2:47:17] <Dragon_Batman> @moshvik The overall plot is roughly the same but as you can see in a later part to this demo there is actual changes and additions that are new so those would be the spoilers. Who knows what else they might have added,
[2:47:17] <Chaoko99> also it's not like Squeenix doesn't have their hands so far up an Orchestra's ass as to refer to them as a sock puppet
[2:47:18] <%thegreenbenis> Jessie
[2:47:20] <Chaoko99> why wouldn't they do music
[2:47:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> Jessie CHAMBERS
[2:47:21] <+wvuboii> Yeah jessie my b
[2:47:24] <%spiritofmojave> Jessie
[2:47:25] <TastySammiches> camera nooo
[2:47:31] <%ssjklyco> How do you confuse Jessie and Tifa
[2:47:34] <+BurkeBigsby> Damn, can't wait for PC/next gen release of this.
[2:47:34] <moshvik> Damn
[2:47:36] <%peachy996> Break yourself Fool
[2:47:39] <ireliaismaiwaifu> the ffxv camera strikes
[2:47:40] <CrypticMochi> I think you get different hits from holding attacks, not sure
[2:47:41] <MyNameIsRasus> @PortableBoredom I actually found the main gameplay loop an the combat system fun enough to keep me going despite hating every second of the plot, but to each their own I guess
[2:47:44] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> And just like Rebecca, Jesse will be forgotten later
[2:47:46] <%sporeian94> fuco these guys
[2:47:48] <%tizz86> they made Jessie waifu material to make it hurt more
[2:47:48] <+ShedVolans> Guys he only has 26 minutes I don't think he's gonna make it
[2:47:49] <Vikbosss> Barret plz
[2:47:50] <Dutchpotato> @heroicspiritavenger ok but what does that have to do with this game? U can beat this demo without being a pro sure but it absolutely rewards skill and understanding of mechanics
[2:47:52] <%j0ustar> they're remixes and they're honestly fine I really don't know what people want in here. A full music switch?
[2:47:52] <MemnonV> those things sound like the star wars prequel droids
[2:47:56] <+Corvellia> @ssjklyco He was just thinking of who the best girl is but forgot that changed to Jessie in this game
[2:47:59] <ThDark> Love getting the parry
[2:48:02] <iamtheTwitchghost> rip that guy
[2:48:02] <PortableBoredom> I can't wait to love Jessie due to all of her increased screen time only for them to explode
[2:48:03] <Aydarkzero> @ShedVolans THERE'S NO TIME
[2:48:04] <Djinnazz> Yah, that Punisher parry is awesome.
[2:48:05] <%InugamiTheHound> can you swap material in the demo?
[2:48:08] <DandyMackeroos> Yeah, Jessie gonna be a corpse waifu
[2:48:12] <moshvik> @Dragon_Batman Damn then I bettter keep up to speed, I just know how BIG of a game FF7 is kind of a real killer that it's parts, hopefully the parts come out quick
[2:48:13] <%WhereIsWill> hey @patstaresat how bad of shape would square Enix be in if this was a 1/10??
[2:48:16] <TastySammiches> it's the opening tutorial mission of course you can spam your way through it
[2:48:16] <MyNameIsRasus> The parry mechanic in this is fucking sick
[2:48:21] <+BurkeBigsby> HD exploding Jessie atpGasm
[2:48:21] <tanarath> @plagueofgripes How happy are you about the parry system in this?
[2:48:24] <%peachy996> Oh please we all know Jessie will be considered Best Girl of the Demo
[2:48:32] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> the hit sparks are gorgeous
[2:48:35] <%peachy996> It's still an Aerith/Tifa war
[2:48:35] <bimjojo> YER DUN
[2:48:42] <+heroicspiritavenger> @Dutchpotato My point is this game isn't FF7. It's neither a good RPG. Nor is it a good action game. It's something inbetween, that isn't good. It doesn't go all in on being one thing. It doesn't know what it wants to be.
[2:48:49] <%RabbiKing> Waiting for secret boss in the final game to be a stranger in a black cloak wielding a giant key
[2:48:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @peachy996 Aries is in the cenimatics so NO
[2:48:57] <Monkeyweed21> So does Cloud have a Benis or a Bussy?
[2:49:00] <ape_hawk> OMG, CLOUDS FOCUSED THRUST IS JUST HIS SPECIAL ATTACK IN KINGDOM HEARTS
[2:49:00] <yourliteraldog> Yup
[2:49:01] <MyNameIsRasus> @peachy996 isn't she the only female character that appears in the demo
[2:49:01] <Djinnazz> XD
[2:49:02] <+BurkeBigsby> Tifa remains un impaled and deflagrated. She is the victor

[2:50:18] <wookie5358> Pat's penis requires google to find
[2:50:21] <Dutchpotato> @heroicspiritavenger it’s not trying to be a full action game though, it’s clearly focusing on resources and menu management like FF7 without the slow pace of a turn based game
[2:50:22] <%trustycoyote> 2 lewd, Pat...
[2:50:22] <%Arweynn> Did pat just make Shinra's siri destroy the reactor?
[2:50:23] <a_mad_dragon> oops the rebels didn't blow it up enough GOTTA DO IT OURSELVES
[2:50:25] <Burningskull01> You should try out Classic mode after this run.
[2:50:25] <%InugamiTheHound> Japan loves iphones and Imacs
[2:50:27] <Guardiansaiyan> Reactor 1 was an INSIDE JOB

[2:50:30] <+Frampton1337> goddamnit pat, you made my google home go off
[2:50:31] <+heroicspiritavenger> @Zombrocom I factually hate the game. I don't want to.
[2:50:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> LOL CLOUD FUCKED UP
[2:50:32] <AmaranthSparrow> @heroicspiritavenger And you're really going to criticize the gameplay without ever touching it yourself? Do you watch people eat food and complain about how bad it tastes, too?
[2:50:34] <%FacetiousAF> google? on MY penis? its more likely than you think
[2:50:35] <+FrenchTact1cs> REACTOR WAS AN INSIDE JOB

[2:50:40] <Monkeyweed21> Google needs Pat's Penis
[2:50:40] <Chaoko99> What's classic mode do?

[2:51:03] <GeltonZ> @Chaoko99 "Classic Mode" is jut auto battle. It's depressing.
[2:51:07] <%Wrashis> classic mode is baby mode. it just auto attacks and moves for you and all you do is cast spells
[2:51:08] <%trustycoyote> Demo perfection has been saved

[2:51:27] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> sploosh
[2:51:27] <%FacetiousAF> sploosh
[2:51:28] <+Corvellia> Are you excited to watch Cloud beat the hell out of [redacted] at the temple of the ancients?
[2:51:29] <Monkeyweed21> White boy CAN jump

[2:51:36] <Coystick> I'll come on, Jessie
[2:51:37] <Baeltyr> @peachy996 Kappa
[2:51:37] <kingbaconcrispy> Little smirk!
[2:51:39] <+Remery_> impress the girl
[2:51:40] <DandyMackeroos> Bogged in all that Jessie sploosh
[2:51:41] <TheIronBrass> Big sploosh
[2:51:41] <wookie5358> Classic mode wouldn't exist if fans didn't scream for combat to be exactly like the original
[2:51:41] <MyNameIsRasus> PHYSICS ARE A LIE
[2:51:43] <%Frost_Quill> So is Yuffie gonna have a crush on Cloud too?
[2:51:45] <kingbaconcrispy> Smash with her Cloud!
[2:51:46] <yourliteraldog> you can her how wet she is
[2:51:51] <Bladeexe> Gonna make the sector 5 reactor awkward now though.
[2:51:56] <+AbnormalVoid> omg
[2:52:00] <+AbnormalVoid> you're probably right
[2:52:00] <AmaranthSparrow> Jessie keeps falling down because the floor is slick for some reason.
[2:52:01] <+heroicspiritavenger> They should have just made a trilogy of movies for FF7 remake, it literally makes no difference. The only interesting parts are between the new gameplay.
[2:52:06] <+Remery_> Cloud and his Harem
[2:52:07] <%FacetiousAF> its gonna suck when jesse dies and both aerith AND tifa aren't nearly as hot
[2:52:08] <yourliteraldog> Like nibbler
[2:52:09] <Animorphimagi> Naw
[2:52:10] <%sporeian94> they would've data mined it already
[2:52:14] <%thegreenbenis> @AmaranthSparrow Heh
[2:52:14] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> GOO GAH
[2:52:14] <+Pyroclase> @heroicspiritavenger you really hate this combat, eh?
[2:52:17] <Jolly_Adventurer> Yuffie's just reading a newspaper on a bench
[2:52:18] <%wolfofsound> @PatStaresAt listen if yuffie can be tried as an adult I can get in there
[2:52:22] <+EdHeng> He's got the flower lol
[2:52:23] <Dragon_Batman> @SoFarFetched Yea I can only imagine how it must feel
[2:52:25] <DandyMackeroos> It’d be an interesting thing
[2:52:25] <King_thunder365> "You're than Ninja"
[2:52:27] <Chaoko99> @GeltonZ just call it easy-auto or baby mode jesus, not "classic"
[2:52:29] <CamiHeart> And now Cloud is Flower Boy
[2:52:29] <King_thunder365> Shit
[2:52:30] <%cureneckbeard> Ass4Dayz
[2:52:30] <+CawffeeMike> they are trying to get us to care about Jessie so much. I kinda like it. I really didn't care about losing the three in the original
[2:52:30] <pootybutt1> wonder if ep 1 will just be everything in Midgar
[2:52:30] <+Corvellia> @heroicspiritavenger You ever consider that the original compilation still exists?
[2:52:30] <sothatsprettybrutal> it's interesting that it gives you this little montage but only of stuff that would happen in like the next 15 minutes
[2:52:31] <%Frost_Quill> Is that the flower the dude stepped on? Is that why it's 1 gil?
[2:52:31] <keatiestofthegribbles> remember yuffies kisses cloud in the train date
[2:52:33] <%ExpressNode> Part 2 will probably be decades from now
[2:52:33] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @Pyroclase some people just wanna hate.
[2:52:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> NOW DO CLASSIC
[2:52:34] <@Moobot> Hey, check out Curse of the Dead Gods! It's cool! Use this link! bit.ly/2Ry5IeB
[2:52:36] <King_thunder365> "You're that ninja"
[2:52:36] <Jolnir> i want to roofie yuffie
[2:52:36] <Captain_Aham> gray fox
[2:52:38] <SaltyShots> @heroicspiritavenger i think the rpg parts might become better in the full game. you have no control over stats, equipment, or materia in the demo so its basically nothing. It will probably shine as the game progresses
[2:52:40] <zentzen> Thats just a reference to BC
[2:52:41] <+Andrizzleton> this demo doesn't have the tifa flashback does it?
[2:52:41] <%YakumoYomi> @FacetiousAF Agreed about the death, disagree about Tifa not being as hot.
[2:52:42] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> I BET YOU WONT BE ABLE TO TURN DOWN THE FLOWER
[2:52:44] <%trustycoyote> @PatStaresAt The small facial expressions add so much personality to these characters we technically don't know
[2:52:45] <%theAncopro> flower run
[2:52:46] <Animorphimagi> That wouldn't fly in the Capital
[2:52:47] <+FrenchTact1cs> Its that ninja...

[2:52:52] <%thegreenbenis> NOW PAY UP FUCKER
[2:52:53] <%SoFarFetched> @Dragon_Batman yeah it sucks for me because there's certain games I can't play because of that. Certain shakes in games Im fine with. But others just make me sick right away.
[2:52:53] <%Wrashis> looks its clearly not clouds hair logo
[2:52:54] <yourliteraldog> Thats her Nindo her Ninja Way

[2:53:31] <+waltzqueen> Very high
[2:53:32] <Chaoko99> I like how Barett's remake design has a suspicious cloth bag covering where the gun is on his arm, as if hiding some kind of horrible surgical site where the gun meets the arm.
