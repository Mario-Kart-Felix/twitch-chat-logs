[1:04:55] <DuoScratch> @vexicbayn but he wants to get splashed, it's to bless the union, and make the outcome of continuation more assured.
[1:04:56] <%EndlessScrapper> Out of the all the children in the Wesker program only two survived and only one got the results they wanted. It was costly and not effective thats why they didn't mass produce it

[1:53:46] <%patriotrenegade> So on Sunday Max's chat devolved into debating who the best girl in "Bleach" was
[1:53:48] <DandyMackeroos> Blonde doesn’t work as well for her general color scheme
[1:53:49] <+glgzephyr> objectively the worst jill is blonde
[1:53:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> @GarbageQueenEllie Problem is the only blonde Jill is the catsuit, pale, mind controlled one that we haven't seen recover yet
[1:53:54] <+nathandiel> Blonde so sexy
[1:53:55] <%tusk102> blonde jill is worst
[1:53:58] <%sniffy77> what r the odds of pat getting a kidney stone on stream?

[1:54:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> @patriotrenegade OKAY THOSE ALL ARE GOOD THO
[1:54:50] <%ha2ken> Brunette girls pretending to be blond
[1:54:51] <KeiPrime> the fact you didnt say Unohana
[1:54:53] <%Dragon_Batman> All of the above really
[1:54:53] <%patriotrenegade> And chat was all like RANGIKU THO
[1:54:57] <KeiPrime> I mean unohana is up there
[1:55:05] <%Nina96> sfv patch is banning players for using the netcode mod
[1:55:06] <%SMuffinMan> @ricky12k That's correct.
[1:55:08] <ricky12k> @patriotrenegade jeez man.
[1:55:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> @patriotrenegade Eh, Rangiku is B tier Bleach girl
[1:55:17] <%punkthepsychopenguin> Did they read donations
[1:55:24] <%punkthepsychopenguin> Or not yet
[1:55:25] <+R_BChe> SFV netcode patch was removing the fan fixed patch :( tis a sad dayy
[1:55:26] <%JJCheeker> I don't mind if they pretend you get the best of both worlds
[1:55:33] <KeiPrime> as long as no one said any of those 5 quincy girls
[1:55:37] <+nathandiel> Not new ones
[1:55:37] <fairore> @nina96 thanks for that I suck at typing and texting
[1:55:38] <%GalacticaPhanto> I mean isnt the new netcode patch adding rollback or was this a massive lie?
[1:55:38] <%Oxybe> Kenpaci best girl
[1:55:43] <%tusk102> @punkthepsychopenguin they did at the beginning and will likely read them again after the break
[1:55:50] <%SMuffinMan> @r_bche Seriously? wow
[1:55:51] <+whoguru5> so is SFV's netcode still garbo?
[1:55:53] <%punkthepsychopenguin> Oh thank you tusk
[1:55:55] <+R_BChe> SFV is already rollback, it is poorly implemented rollback that was the problem
[1:55:58] <%thepeoplezoo> HOLY SHIT CAPCPOM THAT SFV NETCODE SHIT IS BAD
[1:56:00] <%patriotrenegade> Look, Hallibel (adult) Nel, Isane, Kuukau are best girl, fuck off if you think otherwise
[1:56:01] <%Dragon_Batman> Depends on if the new netcode patch is actually fixing anything
[1:56:10] <%Kegeto> Claire Redfield is my waifu
[1:56:10] <%D3rrtyD4n> pat called it
[1:56:12] <Psych_man13_13> Pat, you have to play Desperate Escape, its Jill content and your doing this whole thing for RE3
[1:56:13] <+necrocannibal2> oh, okay, saw it now. all they did was patch the mod out.

[2:02:18] <%krawtch> this fight on the PC version can have a fuck up with the key-holding enemy that you need a fan patch to fix
[2:02:19] <Jetsfantasy> @dan_g_v Paige was able to restrain her killing instincts

[2:12:57] <+Rivet95> eat da flowa
[2:12:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this whole game is just Chris and Sheva bumbling from one place to another.

[2:27:20] <Pwgregory> “Wait. Wesker. Betray me? I never saw it coming!”
[2:27:21] <Grennold> Better writing than Nu-Star Wars LuL
[2:27:21] <captnbellybutton> "daddy"
[2:27:22] <myriad_truth> Natalya is never mentioned again...

[2:27:25] <dan_g_v> Gawd?
[2:27:25] <+Rivet95> that's not how rights work Wesker
[2:27:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> I reject my humanity Spencer
[2:27:27] <%ha2ken> Wesker says OK BOOMER.
[2:27:27] <YaiGameworks> In fairness, Ozwell completely deserved this
[2:27:27] <%Shadicara> STANDO POWAH
[2:27:28] <LordLicoriceDerp> You can't even mock Wesker's voice in this game, it's just too ludicrous
[2:27:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> King of the Pirates? You?
[2:27:29] <dan_g_v> oh, squelchy!
[2:27:29] <BurdRightsActivist> DUDE HE JUST GOT KAKYOIN'D
[2:27:30] <Tampaoster> KINGU KURIMISUM
[2:27:30] <%kingbaconcrispy> @samuelfisk I like greedy human Wesker
[2:27:30] <%AncelDeLambert> Adoptive abusive father
[2:27:31] <%krawtch> just a heads up, Wesker could do that to Chris at any moment but instead chooses to just backhand him and toss him into a pile of pillows
[2:27:31] <%the_vedo_show> doodWesker doodWesker doodWesker
[2:27:33] <%ElenaManetta> i said "a" god, i didn't say a powerful god
[2:27:35] <%Dragon_Batman> Angriest Pat would have
[2:27:36] <+Dr_Mooose> talkin that shit
[2:27:37] <%JJCheeker> I mean HE is gonna die anyway
[2:27:37] <%ElenaManetta> he could've been the god of old
[2:27:38] <+necrocannibal2> Wesker is super humble
[2:27:42] <%Shadicara> psaBougie
[2:27:42] <Run44forrest> WESKER HAS THE HOKUTO SHINKEN PogChamp
[2:27:43] <boomstickery> this voice actor doing an alan rickman

[2:27:44] <%Kegeto> Whiskers
[2:27:45] <Psych_man13_13> Albert "Humble" Wesker
[2:27:46] <%demegodz> SO AROGENT,,,,anywasys
[2:27:46] <Grennold> Here comes the line
[2:27:46] <myriad_truth> Wesker is pretty much a physical god.
[2:27:51] <+Skwizgarr> doodWesker doodWesker doodWesker
[2:27:52] <CloniiCory> Bring me to life is playing in the other room right now and that's so perfect for how Edgelord Wesker is.
[2:27:54] <%ElenaManetta> i love it
[2:27:54] <%lionandfox21> The early years of the Wesker Children are "monitor'd" at a distance
[2:27:54] <BurdRightsActivist> THE RIGHT.
[2:27:55] <dukenux> Wesker with his humble Ubermnensch crap
[2:27:55] <+Skelegroove> Quite the line of narcissist
[2:27:56] <%Valdorick> THE RIGHT
[2:27:58] <%tusk102> "god ur so arrogant. now btw i will be a god because i was a real god"
[2:27:58] <%SirGO0SE> I have the right to have the right
[2:28:01] <%krawtch> ultimate lifeform
[2:28:02] <%legendscar01> why did Wesker do that? nooooo
[2:28:02] <+Rivet95> You have to be... capable of being a god to be a god? Can we get a no shit Sherlock?
[2:28:03] <energywarning> "haha, what a wonderful flashback for me."
[2:28:03] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd the right
[2:28:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> MMMMMm me
[2:28:04] <Run44forrest> KKona I HAVE THE RIGHT
[2:28:04] <kingra> NO ME :)
[2:28:04] <+Skwizgarr> doodWesker that right is now mine though
[2:28:05] <%Valdorick> The Right, to use the phrase "The Right."
[2:28:05] <%AncelDeLambert> I have the right of POWER!!!!
[2:28:05] <+D00msDayDan> i have the civil right
[2:28:06] <lloyddboy> B A S A
[2:28:06] <wrydiculous> What about the left tho
[2:28:06] <%cardboardboots> THE RIGHT TO BE A GOD
[2:28:06] <%kingbaconcrispy> Urobouros!!
[2:28:06] <%mankeytennis> Fear the old blood, wesker
[2:28:07] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I know my rights.
[2:28:07] <%Alpha8087> Fight for your right to party

[2:28:07] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> No this is CAPCOM
[2:28:08] <%ElenaManetta> its not a right it's a privilege
[2:28:08] <%happyface699> sipsipRude sipsipRude sipsipRude sipsipRude sipsipRude
[2:28:08] <TurtlesAndTentacles> not biologically. Read the files it's super clear... CRAZY TALK
[2:28:08] <Scorian> complete global saturation
[2:28:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> E D G E
[2:28:09] <cheezbass> YOU GOTTA FIGHT

[2:28:14] <Psych_man13_13> Get that incendary ammo
[2:28:14] <%EndlessScrapper> This isn't advantageous. Wesker has to take drugs in order to maintain his human intellect or he mutates in a mindless monster. Being dependent on a drug FOR LIFE is not superiority
[2:28:15] <mobiusnightshade> I HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE A CLOD
[2:28:15] <%walternatorz> how does that translate in Japanese?
[2:28:15] <%Kegeto> The right to be a gawd

[2:28:18] <%EuropanLamprey> Wesker has the right to be Edgy
[2:28:18] <DrkJP520> Japan is so obsessed with gods and shit, but in every rpg you just grind for a few hours and oh look at that god is dead
[2:28:23] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> MUH RIGHTS
[2:28:24] <BlacSoul> I AM A SOVEREIGN CITIZEN
[2:28:25] <rubbishbinge> Hmm divine right you say?
[2:28:26] <%kingbaconcrispy> I'm not arrogant, I'm God.
[2:28:26] <%Kriss1827> wesker might have the right but i have the left
[2:28:27] <SpaceCatStation> he's got that God Privilege
[2:28:30] <%camsool> I have the right to party
[2:28:31] <dukenux> I am ze Ubermeeeeeensch!
[2:28:31] <%cardboardboots> is it suppose to be the RITE or the RIGHT
[2:28:31] <%krawtch> wesker has cat eyes because hes uwu
[2:28:33] <%ElenaManetta> pat's just upset because canadians don't have god rights
[2:28:34] <alexandrecau> ourobowrow
[2:28:34] <RollCritFail> Unlike I, Albert Wesker, Notorious Narcissist
[2:28:35] <WeaponX3521> The Right to be a WEED GOD!!!!
[2:28:37] <Pwgregory> God. Is dead.
[2:28:38] <%tigerspath> my right to become a dog!
[2:28:41] <%tusk102> GUN
[2:28:41] <%Oxybe> Wesker is just a big stupid Chunni.
[2:28:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 376 HANDGUN ROUNDS
[2:28:43] <KeiPrime> 100 round beretta
[2:28:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> PogChamp
[2:28:45] <%supersugoisenpai1> I can throw a tantrum after losing in Fortnite, I have the right
[2:28:45] <Run44forrest> right. why would it be rite
[2:28:45] <+necrocannibal2> nice
[2:28:46] <%happyface699> Superhuman privilege
[2:28:47] <Marpolo13> but if he is right does that this make him arrogant ?
[2:28:47] <jcflyguy> 100 rounds wtf
[2:28:47] <%Dragon_Batman> A winner is you
[2:28:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> Wesker just wants a quiet life

[2:28:58] <%ElenaManetta> take the needles out
[2:28:58] <+necrocannibal2> 100 fucking rounds
[2:29:01] <KeiPrime> a full stack of handgun ammo cant reload it to full
[2:29:02] <DandyMackeroos> @drkjp520 Them Kami’s were sometimes people who ascended to “godhood”.
[2:29:09] <mobiusnightshade> Wesker wants a beautiful DUWANG.
[2:29:12] <sellyourselfshort> with a fully upgraded handgun you have the right to be a god
[2:29:12] <daemos123> why does pat have so many rockets
[2:29:13] <Run44forrest> heal your shotgun.. with bullets
[2:29:13] <%tusk102> @necrocannibal2 look at how many rounds are sitting in the box
[2:29:14] <%Oxybe> Wesker is a Chuunibiyou.
[2:29:14] <DraxTD> krunkAnguish krunkMaria krunkLivi krunkMacho
[2:29:16] <%ElenaManetta> paige is the pasta and pat is the meatballs
[2:29:19] <myriad_truth> Dragon Age is a good game
[2:29:20] <%ShichiNoBushi> I want to see art of a handgun with a magazine that should hold 100 bullets.
[2:29:21] <jcflyguy> Super Kami Wesker
[2:29:22] <%krawtch> wesker didnt rage out after losing in RE1, so he lost twice

[2:32:48] <%krawtch> if ouroboros gave everything huge cans i'd probably replay this game
[2:32:50] <%Oxybe> ALL I WANNA DO, IS SEE YOU TURN INTO A GIANT WOMAN A GIANT WOMAN! ALL I WANNA BE, IS SOMEONE WHO GETS TO SEE A GIANT WOMAN!
[2:32:51] <%ElenaManetta> they've been fighting monsters forever
[2:32:54] <Grennold> "wow that thing sure is big" DatSheffy
[2:32:56] <%JD_Lars> First time Paige
[2:32:56] <%GarbageNirvana> @DandyMackeroos Yeah but do they interact at all
[2:32:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Zombrocom he already has the progenitor in his body thus we don't know if humans could survive
[2:32:58] <%AncelDeLambert> WE'RE IN DANGER okay we went through a door we're safe now
[2:32:59] <BurdRightsActivist> @Sphincter_Spelunker Chris is fucking seething
[2:33:01] <s1rcuit> the only 2 things these giant flesh monsters have in common are giant eyeball weakspots and tendrils
[2:33:04] <%RowenCleric> damn I wish ouroboros was cooler looking... this should be a cool horrifying akira moment buts its not....
[2:33:05] <DrkJP520> aww shiet here we go again
[2:33:05] <%SirGO0SE> @Neo_Kaiser if you turn goop sideways..
[2:33:06] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Pat and Woolie get hard for tired characters
[2:33:08] <%GarbageNirvana> Because I don't recall them ever saying anything to each other
[2:33:09] <%ShichiNoBushi> Look up throught the hole and see Nero fighting it off.
[2:33:09] <%patriotrenegade> good thing they have Spider Sense
[2:33:11] <CloniiCory> Like I say that as someone who likes RE4 and 5. 6 makes them even more obnoxious.
[2:33:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> BOATS
[2:33:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Like the closest he gets is Krouser
[2:33:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> big ass boat
[2:33:20] <%realm_forge> I have yet to see the upside of ouroboros
[2:33:22] <+SlumberMan> Chris fought a woman who turned into a giant moth like 10 years ago.
[2:33:22] <%GarbageNirvana> *Krauser even
[2:33:22] <KeiPrime> Capcom could have gave us Giant Female Seth but instead they acted like COWARDS an dsaid here's Tiny Male Seth instead
[2:33:23] <Grennold> Cool guys don't look at tentacle monsters DatSheffy
[2:33:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Boat Mansion.
[2:33:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Revel lay a tons

[2:33:31] <SaltyDongs> probably
[2:33:31] <YaiGameworks> Someone on Capcom just really likes boats and ooze monsters.
[2:33:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> always with the goo
[2:33:31] <DandyMackeroos> @garbagenirvana Nope, Wesker is a cameo in RE4 who talks to Ada
[2:33:33] <Run44forrest> revelations final boss is SICK
[2:33:33] <%goose_attack_almanac> Excella shoulda known it would have happened given the amount of :Tentacle: tags on Alberts search engines
[2:33:34] <%tank7013> @tusk102 I think that was a different thing. More like a mega version of type two plagas than uroboros
[2:33:34] <dukenux> REVII also has a boat level
[2:33:35] <+chunkymonkey737> spencer's boat
[2:33:36] <%Neo_Kaiser> The next evolution of goop. Poog.
[2:33:37] <%Oxybe> Boat Mansion is a GOOD one
[2:33:38] <%wolfofsound> @Oxybe wouldn't it be great to you giant and black swarming. your body will bloat like never before tap into the power deep in that virus
[2:33:39] <%Laecerelius> Sheva's the bright eyed, bushy tailed newbie while Chris is over here just sighing and wondering if he should buy a boat.
[2:33:40] <Momotara> Momotara subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:33:40] <%krawtch> the end boss of revelations is very similar to an RE5 boss
[2:33:45] <%ElenaManetta> I'm watching old Two Best Friends LPs and whenever Paige says "What do you mean?" my brain thinks she's being sarcastic cause of Matt
[2:33:48] <+Skwizgarr> gooified
[2:33:49] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt pat this is clearly where RE7 came from in which you literally go to a freighter and fight black goo
[2:33:51] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:33:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> That's all a cruise liner is. A boat mansion.
[2:33:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @BurdRightsActivist Then he gets confused on how baby making works and thinks the Ada clone is their daughter
[2:33:54] <evbites> re 8 at an airport or a blimp?
[2:33:56] <+necrocannibal2> LUL
[2:33:57] <%grandark_z317> @keiprime that's what Mods are for.
[2:33:59] <DRAGKUDO> rev2 doesn't have a boat level
[2:34:00] <DandyMackeroos> I think Wesker is reserved only for Chris
[2:34:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> That tentacle was outta range LUL
[2:34:05] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Paige is too used to evil goo
[2:34:08] <CloniiCory> The Gameboy RE is also on a boat. Someone at Capcom just loves boats.
[2:34:12] <BurdRightsActivist> @Sphincter_Spelunker when does this happen because holy fucking shit that sounds stupid
[2:34:15] <KeiPrime> It's a Cowards move nonetheless
[2:34:17] <%Momotara> I
[2:34:18] <Run44forrest> boat fetish
[2:34:23] <%Momotara> Waa
[2:34:25] <myriad_truth> RE boats SUCK!!
[2:34:33] <%krawtch> boats are scary, because of the implication
[2:34:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Wesker's Pimp cup
[2:34:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Wow, it's the holy grai;
[2:34:40] <YaiGameworks> Someone just left their CHALICE OF PURE GOLD in their ship locker.
[2:34:42] <%Solidnick18> Yep
[2:34:45] <dukenux> Wesker drinks CRUNK
[2:34:48] <SpaceCatStation> now you can make a new chalice dungeon!
[2:34:50] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @BurdRightsActivist I made up that last part. But during dialogue between Ada and Leon in 6 about "that one night" or something
[2:34:52] <Divantae> never go on a cruise in RE land
[2:34:52] <%SirGO0SE> FUCKING KENNY
[2:34:55] <+mankeyfigh> I just want the Wesker fight and that hilarious QTE fail
[2:34:56] <Vashido22> chat, did Pat hear about the sfv stuff yet?
[2:34:59] <+necrocannibal2> and got so far
[2:35:02] <%ElenaManetta> bah
[2:35:03] <DandyMackeroos> Oh, Leon does meet Wesker’s son
[2:35:03] <boomstickery> @PatStaresAt being A Canada Person, do you own a gun to fight bears and moose?
[2:35:06] <%Laecerelius> BAAAAABE!!

[2:35:08] <%ElenaManetta> like a sheep
[2:35:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> Boats are known for being floating biohazards sometimes
[2:35:14] <CloniiCory> To show you the power of Uroboros, I sawed this boat in half!
[2:35:15] <usurper_sos> Doing a lot of beb this session

[2:35:33] <%happyface699> BABEE
[2:35:34] <%krawtch> remember that time Wesker had access to an orbital laser but didnt use it to glass Chris
[2:35:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> too many people in too tight of space isolated from the world
[2:35:35] <%Oxybe> OH SHIT DID WESKER HIRE PRE-WALKING DEAD KENNY?
[2:35:37] <DandyMackeroos> Aren’t these ouroboros unique to this part only?
[2:35:38] <wydamn> @CloniiCory that fucking got me.

[2:35:56] <daemos123> which game is next? re6 or revelations 1?
[2:35:57] <Run44forrest> JOBBER WESKER
[2:35:58] <%Dragon_Batman> She was kinda kool
[2:35:58] <Samaugsch2> I wish there was an option to let kenny stab jane, shoot kenny in the head, and then throw aj away
[2:35:58] <KeiPrime> oh right rev2
[2:35:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Barry gets a Wesker to deal with.
[2:36:00] <%ShichiNoBushi> Then next comes Alfred Wesker.
[2:36:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> She wesker
[2:36:01] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:36:02] <YaiGameworks> This is the room with Ethan W. also, which made everyone think RE7's protag was evil pre-release.
[2:36:02] <dan_g_v> Alex is kinda hot
[2:36:03] <myriad_truth> Technically not an Ada Clone
[2:36:04] <RollCritFail> Are the Revelations games good?
[2:36:05] <mMayrro> hehhahhehhah
[2:36:09] <KeiPrime> they're ok
[2:36:10] <%wolfofsound> I hope the next one is Jimmy Wesker
[2:36:10] <%happyface699> God I love hot rod
[2:36:11] <Psych_man13_13> Read the note on the wall
[2:36:11] <DandyMackeroos> Yay clones
[2:36:12] <dan_g_v> Revelations are good
[2:36:13] <+mankeyfigh> Apparently we still don’t know if there’s an incoming fix for SFV
[2:36:16] <%ElenaManetta> was this a scrapped room
[2:36:17] <StarlitStunner> Or the boat in Gaiden and the boat in Dead Aim @patstaresat
[2:36:18] <daemos123> Cletus Wesker
[2:36:18] <%ElenaManetta> or like
[2:36:19] <zafooru> *breathes muscularly*
[2:36:19] <%SoFarFetched> @daemos123 Revelations, schedule for games will be below in details.
[2:36:20] <%NickNackProductions> Paige looks kinda like Alex tbh
[2:36:21] <%ElenaManetta> a leftover room rather
[2:36:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> this is exactly the same in RE7
[2:36:24] <BurdRightsActivist> That's a PERFECT room to fight the SQUIGGLY WIGGLY??
[2:36:25] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @dan_g_v considering the end of that game. "Why, don't you have a seat?"
[2:36:26] <%cureneckbeard> Where did they put the fight
[2:36:30] <thelonechris> Shango Unchained
[2:36:32] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Crazy Talk??
[2:36:33] <%tusk102> uroburos literally never returns despite it being the "ULTIMATE BIO WEAPON FOR COMPLETE GLOBAL SATURATION"
[2:36:33] <+senfood> Laser Papa Shango
[2:36:37] <evbites> same layout as 7
[2:36:38] <Clu_Flynn> D'JANGO
[2:36:39] <+chunkymonkey737> blah blah hammer of dawn
[2:36:42] <%Oxybe> LTD: LAUNCHER TYPE DEVICE.
[2:36:45] <YaiGameworks> Uroboros is in Revelations 2 actually.
[2:36:46] <Clu_Flynn> USE THE D'JANGO
[2:36:50] <wrydiculous> PAPA SHANGO
[2:36:51] <DrkJP520> This game could've used more breathing rooms in between zombie gun fights
[2:36:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> HAMMER OF DAWN
[2:36:54] <dan_g_v> @Sphincter_Spelunker you mean the spy cafe scene?
[2:36:54] <Run44forrest> @RollCritFail rev1 is great on 3ds looks weird upscaled on consoles. rev2 is also good but the partner ai sucks
[2:36:54] <%Dragon_Batman> What the hell was it called
[2:36:55] <%Faustgesicht> The D'jango laser?
[2:36:55] <%lionandfox21> Man the villains in these are the dumbest smart people
[2:36:56] <%chambatron> Want to die
[2:36:56] <%Monkeyweed21> Does Paige want to become a God and destroy the world cuz she's a test tube baby?
[2:36:57] <%tusk102> USE THE BIG HAMMER OF DAWN
[2:36:58] <%Dragon_Batman> that was it
[2:37:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tusk102 because normal people understand oro is fucking crazy
[2:37:03] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd atpRtsd
[2:37:05] <%SMuffinMan> @rollcritfail Rev is great, Rev2 even better
[2:37:08] <BoneofMalkav> Papa Shango and Papa Shampoo in a Hair vs Hair vs Hair match
[2:37:10] <+Skwizgarr> MARCUS USE THE HAMMER
[2:37:12] <%krawtch> Wesker has been sitting on orbital laser weapons all day and never once thought of using it on Chris
[2:37:13] <%jotarokujo1010> When you guys do RE6, you should do a knife only co-op run but give Paige a single rocket launcher for the entire game.
[2:37:17] <BinaryShuffle> SPACE LAZOR
[2:37:17] <+necrocannibal2> Gears of War 1-3 are the shit
[2:37:17] <%Dragon_Batman> Paint the target
[2:37:18] <%patriotrenegade> Umbrella Space Corps
[2:37:18] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Explaining it in Piage speak
[2:37:19] <Samaugsch2> @monkeyweed21 Wouldn’t blame her tbh
[2:37:19] <%Solidnick18> it's a big old space laser
[2:37:19] <dan_g_v> the only ones that were not spies were Chris and Jill, right?
[2:37:21] <%tusk102> @doc_ock_rokc but normal people also employ the other viruses
[2:37:25] <KaseKaizer> it sucks when you can't just say "it's the Hammer of Dawn" NotLikeThis
[2:37:25] <%cursedwithadhd> next couples playthrough any of the Gears games
[2:37:28] <%Solidnick18> Hammer of dawn
[2:37:28] <+chunkymonkey737> GoW2 hammer of dawn was so friggin OP lol
[2:37:30] <%ShichiNoBushi> Space lasers are best lasers.
[2:37:30] <%tusk102> @doc_ock_rokc which are arguably just as bad
[2:37:31] <gamezerox> This is your reward Peach you can now KILL GIANT WOMAN!
[2:37:33] <%wolfofsound> well I guess we'll see
[2:37:35] <Psych_man13_13> Hey Excella
[2:37:37] <%ElenaManetta> introducing big fucking monster!
[2:37:37] <Zebroneath> How do they have a space laser?
[2:37:37] <%Dragon_Batman> I mean like go to Home Depot get some paint make it look lovely

[2:37:40] <%chambatron> Just one whole boob
[2:37:40] <+lethallylactic> Big 'ole dicks
[2:37:42] <%wolfofsound> I wish
[2:37:42] <%krawtch> her face is not the feature this monster needs.
[2:37:42] <dan_g_v> fun time!
[2:37:42] <%tusk102> GLOWING WEAK POINTS

[2:37:46] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd atpRtsd
[2:37:47] <%luftraumm1> is it called Shango because of the bantu god of war?
[2:37:48] <%Alpha8087> ORBS
[2:37:49] <%Laecerelius> Giant glowing weak points, my favorite!
[2:37:49] <+necrocannibal2> I like this boss theme
[2:37:50] <mMayrro> hey look it's Iustitia Kappa
[2:37:51] <%linSP> aw yeah, those red things are her tits
[2:37:51] <dan_g_v> her ovaries are glowing!
[2:37:52] <KeiPrime> i dont think quint and keith were spies
[2:37:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> What a Ingenious bioweapon
[2:37:54] <%patriotrenegade> its just a stinger
[2:37:56] <KeiPrime> jackass and grinder
[2:38:03] <%Neo_Kaiser> The reason why they ran from it earlier is because they couldn't see its weak points.
[2:38:03] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @dan_g_v The stinger at the end with Moira and the gang hanging out at Barry's home
[2:38:05] <dan_g_v> those are ovaries. Wait until the womb shows up to shot
[2:38:07] <%Oxybe> ALL I WANNA DO, IS SHOOT A LASER INTO, A GIANT WOMAN A GIANT WOAMN! ALL I WANT TO SEE, WRITHING AROUND IN FRONT OF ME IS A GIANT WOMAN
[2:38:08] <%tusk102> pat thats not a rocket launcher
[2:38:13] <Run44forrest> was the guy jill hung out with a spy?
[2:38:19] <%Dragon_Batman> There will be some goops to shoot near you too
[2:38:20] <dan_g_v> ah, you mean 2 @Sphincter_Spelunker I thought you meant the first one
[2:38:21] <%krawtch> that would have been so easy to use on Chris earlier
[2:38:21] <%patriotrenegade> laser designator launcher
[2:38:26] <DrkJP520> The explosion is so fucking cool
[2:38:30] <alexandrecau> shoot the boob
[2:38:30] <+dmtjinni> Paige bring the views!!!
[2:38:31] <KeiPrime> the big dude? he was a spie

[2:38:32] <%Solidnick18> shoot her goo gina
[2:38:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I like this music, it's pretty grand for fighting a big squid lady
[2:38:34] <%EndlessScrapper> Why does he jerk like theres kickback from the guidance system?
[2:38:35] <alexandrecau> while it is swollen
[2:38:36] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> So this is what Wesker wants for the world
[2:38:37] <dan_g_v> yeah, we kinda gotta check back in `possible super villain in the making
[2:38:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tusk102 T virus has good products, Las plaugas is powerful in the right hands
[2:38:38] <%natebud> hey cut excella some slack, she's an unstable biocursed creature, not going to be perfect the first time
[2:38:39] <Dhurkst> "I've stocked up on stinger missiles!"
[2:38:41] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt tell her to use the machine gun for range
[2:38:44] <%snow_bush> Shoot your goo page!
[2:38:46] <%Laecerelius> Swolen with plague juices
[2:38:50] <%lionandfox21> @Run44forrest If you're talking about rev, its Chris' partner
[2:38:51] <evbites> why do bioweapons have weak points
[2:38:51] <%tusk102> @doc_ock_rokc ur right i suppose.
[2:38:53] <thelonechris> So he wants a hentai universe?
[2:38:55] <%Neo_Kaiser> Shoot your goo mai dude!
[2:38:56] <+Skwizgarr> gooey leach monsters everywhere
[2:38:56] <%Laecerelius> Wesker fucking loves tentacle porn
[2:38:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> he has a fetish, dont kinkshame
[2:38:58] <YaiGameworks> Wesker's coming out of the closet full-stop with his tentacle fetish.
[2:39:00] <%Dragon_Batman> Well he wants not this to happen
[2:39:02] <Sol_Install> wesker wants to be like zone so fucking bad
[2:39:03] <Dova573> Turns out Wesker is really into tentacle hentai
[2:39:04] <KeiPrime> everyone's a damn spy even the head of the bsaa guy
[2:39:04] <%krawtch> many worms, a couple huge mounds. whats not to love
[2:39:05] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> His perfect universe is a tentaclemonster?
[2:39:06] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @dan_g_v I remember nothing from 1 to be honest. Other than Ronald McDonald and bulldog Parker
[2:39:06] <%tusk102> missed
[2:39:06] <Tampaoster> Lovecraftian goo monsters
[2:39:07] <%ShichiNoBushi> AAAAAAAH!! Real Monsters
[2:39:07] <Xelhesia> Pat u got slime on you
[2:39:08] <+RedKazoo> Dont kinkshame a god!
[2:39:11] <StarlitStunner> My tentacle wife
[2:39:11] <DandyMackeroos> The bio juice is gonna get everywhere
[2:39:12] <%Solidnick18> oh right the adds
[2:39:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> Why was this satilitte thing here?
[2:39:12] <%DracaenaLeaf> lol blind
[2:39:14] <+Skelegroove> Mr. X Seems to be the only real success umbrella had
[2:39:15] <%klholland92> MvC3 anyone?
[2:39:16] <+mankeyfigh> @redkazoo
[2:39:17] <%KeystoneA1> shoot the goop
[2:39:19] <boomstickery> does wesker think those things are sexy?
[2:39:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tusk102 nobody uses G because its uncontrolible and TG is unreliable
[2:39:25] <%grandark_z317> gotta shoot the coom juice
[2:39:25] <%Neo_Kaiser> Quick Paige, shoot the babies!
[2:39:26] <%luftraumm1> he has the RIGHT to have a kink
[2:39:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Skelegroove Nemesis too to an extent
[2:39:28] <Clu_Flynn> 10% of humans would become Wesker, the rest would be... this
[2:39:31] <%PanicSwytch> 4 titties
[2:39:31] <%ssjklyco> The funny part about this is Irving got a better deal when he got injected
[2:39:31] <%InugamiTheHound> so much bio slime
[2:39:32] <myriad_truth> They explain in the document why its there
[2:39:32] <%SirGO0SE> scotch7Red
[2:39:32] <%Slaardacity> Is paige really on adderall?
[2:39:35] <BurdRightsActivist> OH THANK GOD IT GREW WEAKPOINTS. We would have never have known how to kill it!
[2:39:35] <%mankeytennis> shoot your goo my dude
[2:39:38] <YakumoYomi> That's a good question. Could they actual engineer these BOWs to NOT be gross and gooey?
[2:39:40] <%natebud> Wesker's a man who knows what he likes. Goo and tentacles
[2:39:41] <Psych_man13_13> Man, i forgot how long this fight is when you dont use the RPG
[2:39:42] <YaiGameworks> In Wesker's eyes, Excella turning into a giant tentacle goop monster was an upgrade.
[2:39:44] <Run44forrest> PARKER parker wasnt a spy
[2:39:45] <+mankeyfigh> Wesker just wanted a few people like him, he was lonely
[2:39:52] <Dhurkst> @skelegroove Nemesis?
[2:39:53] <Samaugsch2> Is that an akrid?
[2:39:55] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt tell her it only takes a single bullet to kill the small guys
[2:39:57] <%JohnAtDawn> I still don't understand what Wesker WANTS. Like, does he expect the Ouroborus to work on select people the way he was affected by the Progenitor virus? Because there is nothing to suggest that will happen.
[2:39:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> paige look out
[2:39:58] <%ScreamLord> Hammer of Dawn
[2:39:59] <KeiPrime> Parker was kind of a traitor, wasnt he?
[2:39:59] <%Monkeyweed21> paige the goo
[2:40:03] <%lionandfox21> @mankeyfigh lamee
[2:40:06] <KeiPrime> its been a while i forget
[2:40:10] <myriad_truth> Wesker kinda went crazy
[2:40:13] <%natebud> Didn't Seemed have like a dozen other genetic experiment brothers
[2:40:14] <Psych_man13_13> also, how is an RPG stronger than a laser?
[2:40:21] <Run44forrest> @JohnAtDawn Complete Global Saturation
[2:40:23] <KeiPrime> he like kinda betrays jill and unbetrays or osome shit
[2:40:26] <Zombrocom> Isn't the only reason wesker isn't a giant tenctacle monster because of that serum he takes regularly? Why does he think anyone is going to not monsterize without that
[2:40:29] <daemos123> wesker wants to create the goo monster singularity
[2:40:30] <%krawtch> hes trying not to lose twice
[2:40:38] <Djinnazz> shoulda saved it forthe eye
[2:40:38] <daemos123> and float through space commanding the goo
[2:40:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> Pat needs her badly
[2:40:40] <Xelhesia> lol
[2:40:41] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> stern

[2:41:14] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> doink CiGrip
[2:41:14] <evbites> @goose_attack_almanac definitely ovaries
[2:41:15] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt they only take 1 shot to kill
[2:41:15] <Run44forrest> fucking MOON LASERS

[2:41:23] <dan_g_v> That was a maniac! Why did it not die?
[2:41:25] <JackalKing> How is the massive space laser not just sinking the ship?
[2:41:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Paige this giant creature is a woman! use your skills to take it out
[2:41:25] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt so don't waste the shotgun on them
[2:41:29] <AntChodeny> Wesker's heart belongs to Rebecca, but unfortunately it's unrequited love
[2:41:29] <%SirGO0SE> oobs
[2:41:31] <%Solidnick18> Wow
[2:41:33] <dukenux> Madame Bovaries
[2:41:38] <+abrupt_abe> Lol, apparently the new SFV netcode patch does nothing but block the fan fixes
[2:41:38] <%kingbaconcrispy> @CloniiCory Their became their own balls
[2:41:41] <%lionandfox21> @natebud yeah but they're all dead except for Alex by this point and they didn't know about each other
[2:41:42] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> shoot the rosebud

[2:41:54] <%GalacticaPhanto> @antchodeny excuse me, que?

[2:42:00] <+sixcubit> kill the Goo Man Group
[2:42:02] <%krawtch> very closed-minded of the BSAA not to even consider becoming giant tentacle tiddy monsters in Wesker's new world
[2:42:03] <+chunkymonkey737> silly gooman vargSkell
[2:42:03] <%AdamTheJaggi> how is this boat still floating after being shot by multiple orbit lasers?
[2:42:14] <%chronoxgp> throbbin pulsating red hard

[2:42:29] <%InugamiTheHound> @Sphincter_Spelunker all of that Chris fisting your "boulder" gave you a "rosebud"
[2:42:30] <%MrDonTacos_> NICE
[2:42:32] <%natebud> Have there been any boss fights yet where the solution wasn't conveniently in the room?
[2:42:33] <%ScreamLord> We started seeing a LOT of Orbital Lasers after Gears of War didn't we?
[2:42:34] <myriad_truth> How is the ship still floating????

[2:43:00] <Clu_Flynn> Excella was Wesker's booty call
[2:43:01] <mobiusnightshade> Excella was evil eye candy.
[2:43:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Doesn't matter now that Paige killed her
[2:43:02] <%AdamTheJaggi> maybe the boat is made of mythril, i dun fuckin' know

[2:43:41] <wydamn> Jill DLC, or Last Chapter?
[2:43:41] <%Dragon_Batman> If Paige was a tropper she would let the neck twist happen
[2:43:44] <%AdamTheJaggi> what's next after RE5?
[2:43:45] <NatetheHunter> Did they already do the 2v2 fight?
[2:43:48] <Run44forrest> why do you have 3 rocket launchers
[2:43:49] <%Neo_Kaiser> I hope Pat deliberately fails the last QTE with the plane QTE section.
[2:43:55] <%krawtch> that orbital laser was more like a laser pointer
[2:43:58] <Psych_man13_13> But Jill
[2:43:59] <samuelfisk> @natethehunter yes
[2:44:05] <YaiGameworks> The DLC for RE5 is actually really good though.

[2:44:11] <dukenux> Goddamit!
[2:44:12] <%WackyXmand> man they really just went full action movie in this game, too over the top tbh

[2:44:19] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt IT'S TIME FOR "RUNNING TPOSE IT'S NOT TELEPORTATION"
[2:44:21] <wydamn> Fair
[2:44:22] <DrkJP520> What if a little bit of it got in the water?
[2:44:24] <%legendscar01> another anime story
[2:44:28] <%wolfofsound> "I will become a god of this fucked to shit earth"
[2:44:31] <%Valdorick> He's the background asshole in RE4 too
[2:44:31] <%rytisone> But you're playing this in preparation for RE3 Remake that stars JILL
[2:44:35] <+Xevtes> his plan is tentacle hentai
[2:44:36] <samuelfisk> @natethehunter no problem. Enjoy
[2:44:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> Retcons all over
[2:44:39] <RollCritFail> Gotta send him off in style
[2:44:41] <%blondie_ow> He was a tiny villain in RE4
[2:44:45] <%logoth_> He got turned into NEO
[2:44:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cool tho]
[2:44:46] <%JackKrauser> Wesker did nothing wrong.
[2:44:46] <TheyCallMeVawn> Its the best
[2:44:46] <%goose_attack_almanac> @PatStaresAt Wait what the fuck is the point of Bioweapons WHEN THERE ARE ORBITAL SPACE LASERS
[2:44:47] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> He watched the Matrix once
[2:44:47] <DandyMackeroos> Unless he wants to be a goo monster then it’s a great idea.
[2:44:49] <Run44forrest> what about re4
[2:44:49] <+chunkymonkey737> nyeheheheh
[2:44:50] <%blondie_ow> At least, only in Ada's story
[2:44:51] <%SMuffinMan> I like it tho
[2:44:51] <Dame_90> He was also in umbrella chronicle
[2:44:52] <mobiusnightshade> 'I will become god by virtue of everyone else turning into shit!'
[2:44:53] <JackalKing> RE5 Wesker is best Wesker
[2:44:53] <%the_vedo_show> doodWesker then fucked shit up in mahvel
[2:44:53] <$lotharrio> He's the face of Umbrella, but Umbrella as a faceless entity is the main villain.
[2:44:56] <dukenux> He was turned into Agent Smith in this
[2:44:56] <+SlumberMan> He was moustache twirly superman in CV.
[2:44:58] <%krawtch> they needed a fighting game villain
[2:44:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> twas a backstory villain in RE4
[2:44:59] <CloniiCory> He is a Saturday Morning Cartoon villain and it's the best.
[2:44:59] <$galaxyswirl> isnt he the main villain in LEONS part of RE6?
[2:45:00] <Clu_Flynn> he is the main villain of the entire franchise ...
[2:45:01] <%jobbedbone> flow of importance in raccoon is convoluted
[2:45:02] <%kingbaconcrispy> He was a tiny villain in 0. Just imagine a tiny wesker
[2:45:03] <%GarbageNirvana> I gotta get my sets in
[2:45:03] <%InugamiTheHound> he had cameo in resident evil 0
[2:45:06] <+XxTippoxX> he was fake in RE1, exactly how he was supposed to be more sinister than he seemed
[2:45:06] <%krawtch> STELF BOMUR
[2:45:06] <+necrocannibal2> @PatStaresAt Wesker watched the Matrix
[2:45:07] <Dame_90> And showed up in RE4
[2:45:11] <KaseKaizer> COMPLETE

[2:45:24] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd atpRtsd
[2:45:25] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Why does he just get in the fucking Jet?
[2:45:26] <%GalacticaPhanto> Best theme in RE history coming through soon
[2:45:26] <%Solidnick18> I'mma dlc
[2:45:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> No shit
[2:45:29] <SilverFaustX> D:
[2:45:29] <myriad_truth> Remember when Wesker was an idiot that got killed by his own BOW???
[2:45:29] <%kingbaconcrispy> @galaxyswirl No that's simmons
[2:45:30] <%Valdorick> I THOUGHT HE WAS JUST BORN THAT WAY
[2:45:31] <dukenux> Jill my platonic friend!
[2:45:33] <%natebud> she'll never make it
[2:45:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Wow who would've thought
[2:45:33] <R3TURNoftheMACK> do the dlc pat you coward
[2:45:35] <%JackKrauser> If it wasn't for Wesker, I would still be on disability.
[2:45:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> So he sucks
[2:45:37] <%jobbedbone> WOLBACHIA?
[2:45:37] <DrkJP520> The W-Virus
[2:45:39] <%spiritofmojave> Hi I'm Ms. DLC!
[2:45:39] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> with Josh, no less. "He's showing me wrestling moves."
[2:45:40] <%frunkAF> Jill looks like Leon
[2:45:41] <wrydiculous> Spread the virus all over the world with ONE STEALTH BOMBER ONLY
[2:45:42] <%klholland92> Old ass phone
[2:45:46] <usurper_sos> Damn
[2:45:47] <%ha2ken> It's weird she reminds me of Leon
[2:45:47] <Clu_Flynn> look at this bullshit they invented so Wesker could be killed
[2:45:47] <+chunkymonkey737> how would she know?
[2:45:48] <+younger54> What?!? A Virus?!? I just thought he was Superman.
[2:45:49] <%krawtch> resident evil and its fetishization of serums
[2:45:51] <DandyMackeroos> You could say that Weskers actions did inspire a whole bunch of Bio terrorism
[2:45:52] <Run44forrest> 4Head double dose him
[2:45:52] <zafooru> that is just leon with a ponytail
[2:45:53] <%legendscar01> from the William birkin virus
[2:45:53] <%aeravon> Sounds like you have to fight him.... IN LAVA
[2:45:54] <CloniiCory> So did they make Jill less hot in this to upsell Sheva?
[2:45:55] <%Valdorick> Fucking WHY!?
[2:45:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> Wesker's talking shit, but he NEEDS injections to function
[2:45:56] <%lionandfox21> Cause Wesker is a dumb bitch
[2:45:59] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd atpRtsd atpRtsd
[2:45:59] <Djinnazz> you think...
[2:46:02] <%chambatron> PAWG42069

[2:46:05] <usurper_sos> She knew it exactly
[2:46:10] <RollCritFail> A/W, aka "Albert Wesker"

[2:46:13] <energywarning> attache case? what's that? sounds useful
[2:46:15] <%spiritofmojave> NOT MY PLATONIC FRIEND!
[2:46:17] <%Monkeyweed21> EVERYONE LOVES ATTACHE-CHAN
[2:46:18] <dan_g_v> time to fill Wesker with all the drugs
[2:46:19] <%krawtch> I HAZ IT CRIS
[2:46:20] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt she knows how to do poison bc she's the master of genetic unlocking
[2:46:21] <%legendscar01> ATTACHE CASE HD
[2:46:22] <%demegodz> JUICE HIM
[2:46:22] <%RowenCleric> attache case really became a fad because of leon everyone carries one nowadays
[2:46:22] <dukenux> This is it Luigi!
[2:46:23] <%MonsieurHedge> even Wesker loves organizing attache cases
[2:46:23] <%isolex_> "I think, but it's this exactly"
[2:46:25] <Psych_man13_13> Did Excella have attache case HD?
[2:46:26] <%Dragon_Batman> Give him the pricking of his life
[2:46:28] <%DarkestDawn64> What a coincidence!
[2:46:28] <%Solidnick18> slightly slower
[2:46:30] <Clu_Flynn> PG... Progenitor GET IT?????

[2:47:08] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:47:09] <Run44forrest> they really shouldve done the re6 piers thing with chris in this one.
[2:47:09] <%XeroSigmaPrime> THE MUSIC IS FUCKING GOOD HERE

[2:47:10] <%patriotrenegade> fantastic
[2:47:12] <%patriotrenegade> perfect
[2:47:13] <%tank7013> One of the worst sequences with some of the best music
[2:47:13] <Tampaoster> eeerrrrooouuuuu
[2:47:15] <$RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt Do they ever explain why Wesker looks like a literal bronze statue in this game?
[2:47:16] <%spiritofmojave> we really were the evil residents huh Chris
[2:47:17] <daemos123> this gauntlet sucks with an ai
[2:47:19] <+FrenchTact1cs> This game is so good
[2:47:19] <trueherobappo> I love this track.
[2:47:21] <DandyMackeroos> Wesker is essentially evil Neo with an Agent Smith voice.
[2:47:25] <myriad_truth> At least the music is dope
[2:47:30] <Run44forrest> @RetroCop87 he tans a lot
[2:47:31] <daemos123> Wesker is Neo and Smith mixed
[2:47:33] <%legendscar01> RE2 track is better
[2:47:37] <%kingbaconcrispy> THe music in this game is pretty decent.
[2:47:39] <%valriot> LUL
[2:47:40] <dking0000> @patstaresat Pat we went over this, he’s not teleporting he’s moving really fast Kappa
[2:47:41] <zafooru> zappy zap

[2:47:48] <myriad_truth> RE2 is better at EVERYTHING
[2:47:49] <DrkJP520> that guy's getting a promotion
[2:47:51] <CloniiCory> Remember how RE: The final chapter killed Wesker with a door?
[2:47:55] <usurper_sos> This music
[2:47:57] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @daemos123 I'm sure there is a fan fiction of that
[2:47:59] <%InugamiTheHound> he hot a good hit in though
[2:47:59] <%Solidnick18> sweet
[2:48:02] <Clu_Flynn> RE2 is not better than 5 at everything lmao
[2:48:02] <%patriotrenegade> why would you wear desert combat fatigues on a boat
[2:48:03] <Run44forrest> wasnt it glass
[2:48:04] <+glgzephyr> man the last four tracks in this game are bangers

[2:48:19] <%happyface699> That was SHOCKING
[2:48:20] <Djinnazz> yeah this wesker fight is kinda dumb.
[2:48:21] <hlreiku> Is pat gonna coop that one too?
[2:48:22] <DandyMackeroos> @sphincter_spelunker Like Neo and Smith have a baby and it’s Wesker?
[2:48:25] <%JackKrauser> MT Framework still looks good.
[2:48:28] <usurper_sos> Here comes the cockroaches
[2:48:32] <+chunkymonkey737> deactivating and releasing all locks
[2:48:32] <+glgzephyr> wesker's final boss music is straight up a John Williams ripoff
[2:48:33] <%cvp5127> just skip to 6
[2:48:33] <+wvuboii> SKIP RE6
[2:48:33] <daemos123> revalations should be next i think

[2:48:44] <%DarkestDawn64> How about REV2?
[2:48:45] <Run44forrest> BOOOO CO OP IT COWARD
[2:48:46] <KeiPrime> music in this section is deeply etched into my memory
[2:48:46] <$lotharrio> You gonna allow invasions for RE6?
[2:48:46] <%RowenCleric> revelations 1 is on sale for 10 bucks is it worth a play?
[2:48:46] <%kingbaconcrispy> Are you doing everyone in RESI 6?
[2:48:48] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @DandyMackeroos you know it, huh?
[2:48:48] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I mean it is. But still coward!
[2:48:49] <%Valdorick> You coulda dropped the word "Coop" from that sentence and it would still be right.
[2:48:50] <DrkJP520> Does re6 coop also have this terrible splitscreen?
[2:48:51] <+lysserd> lysserd subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:48:51] <Clu_Flynn> skip Rev 2
[2:48:53] <%arcielardor> @patstaresat Umbrella Corps when?
[2:48:54] <%legendscar01> Skip RE 6
[2:48:58] <+necrocannibal2> @PatStaresAt how about Rev 2?
[2:48:58] <CloniiCory> Co-Op in RE6 is dogshit, but the AI is just as bad.
[2:49:00] <Run44forrest> REV2 sucks without co op
[2:49:00] <+wvuboii> Skip 6 so you can make it by 3make
[2:49:00] <Djinnazz> lol
[2:49:01] <%kingbaconcrispy> @RowenCleric Yes
[2:49:02] <DandyMackeroos> @sphincter_spelunker Yep

[2:49:06] <%grandark_z317> soon it'll be time to coom to Jill's ass Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:49:14] <%Monkeyweed21> the black evil is chicken based
[2:49:14] <%happyface699> Re 6 co op is great
[2:49:14] <myriad_truth> RE6 Ai is actually pretty good
[2:49:18] <%legendscar01> @patstaresat when's operation raccoon city?
[2:49:22] <%AdamTheJaggi> Co-op rev2?
[2:49:27] <%the_vedo_show> atpCap RE6
[2:49:27] <Run44forrest> re6 just mash triggers
[2:49:33] <42nfl19> @patstaresat is RE Rev 1 single only or has coop?
[2:49:34] <%patriotrenegade> Pat's going to have to beat off MANY dudes at the same time
[2:49:34] <DandyMackeroos> @legendscar01 Oh god, ORC.
[2:49:34] <%duneblythe> have paige solo 6
[2:49:35] <%ForlornCarton> just wait
[2:49:37] <+chunkymonkey737> that means there're candy canes there for power-ups
[2:49:38] <JackalKing> I think it just opens on its own
[2:49:39] <usurper_sos> It opened
[2:49:40] <Dhurkst> @run44forrest Nah, it's fun.
[2:49:42] <Clu_Flynn> RE6 IA is not good, it's just that your allied it cannot die
[2:49:42] <%happyface699> Re 6 is WAY better in co op
[2:49:43] <%legendscar01> lol
[2:49:43] <Samaugsch2> All the dudes
[2:49:46] <+darrylwestly> Leon’s coop is pretty good
[2:49:50] <+glgzephyr> wait aren't there reapers in this section
[2:49:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> RE6 is like DmC its a good game but not a good game for the franchise
[2:49:52] <%ForlornCarton> kill all mans
[2:50:00] <jeffthesequel> Are you going to play all the campaigns in 6?
[2:50:03] <%isolex_> Don't skip resi 6, i haven't seen it
[2:50:08] <%OrganoidZero> Looking forward to seeing you do Revaltions and 6 since they are some of the only few worth playing that we haven't seen you in some compacity play through fully.
[2:50:11] <%aeravon> Music is good, except the horns
[2:50:13] <CloniiCory> Leon and Ada's campaigns are just fine. Chris and Jake are the fucking worst.
[2:50:24] <42nfl19> i had fun cooping witha friend re6
[2:50:29] <myriad_truth> I liked Chris's story...
[2:50:32] <Tampaoster> Did they already played RE Outbreak?
[2:50:37] <DandyMackeroos> Isn’t there a FemHunk in Revelations?
[2:50:37] <dking0000> Can we just collectively forget about Jake
[2:50:39] <Clu_Flynn> Leon's campaign is the worst, you get budget raccoon city then budget uncharted and then you fight a giant fly
[2:50:40] <mMayrro> chris is such a little bitch in re6 LUL
[2:50:41] <42nfl19> but my Bromance
[2:50:42] <Run44forrest> @Dhurkst re6? yeah kinda leons campaign at least
[2:50:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lucky
[2:50:43] <%Dragon_Batman> I don't think he is doing Outbreak
[2:50:43] <Psych_man13_13> FREEZE ROUNDS
[2:50:44] <%krawtch> remember that time in RE6 where China gets blanketed in virus and its a huge epidemic psaWhat
[2:50:47] <KeiPrime> female hunk is raid mode only
[2:50:47] <+necrocannibal2> what the fuck
[2:50:48] <%patriotrenegade> lol
[2:50:49] <Psych_man13_13> NOOOOO

[2:50:54] <Psych_man13_13> RIP
[2:50:55] <cheezbass> lmao paige y u like this
[2:50:56] <%happyface699> @cloniicory Nah all the campaigns suck and that’s coming from someone who has played all of them a combined amount of at least 35 times.
[2:50:57] <DandyMackeroos> @keiprime Oh okay
[2:50:58] <dking0000> Jake is just everything that could’ve went wrong with Nero
[2:50:59] <Finakala> When's RE Gaiden

[2:51:00] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd atpRtsd
[2:51:01] <%jotarokujo1010> 6 is just a longer, more story oriented version of 5 in terms of gameplay though
[2:51:04] <+necrocannibal2> LUL
[2:51:05] <mMayrro> just ate that rocket
[2:51:07] <%rytisone> chosen one
[2:51:09] <Dhurkst> @run44forrest It's cool to switch between characters with mutually exclusive capabilities for different situations
[2:51:14] <BurdRightsActivist> @krawtch Yeah. Like such a thing would EVER happen monkaS
[2:51:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> gasp
[2:51:16] <+gwanzan> GANBATTE!
[2:51:18] <usurper_sos> HE SPAWNED
[2:51:21] <Clu_Flynn> RE6 has the C-Virus right that sounds a bit famliar..... Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:51:25] <%krawtch> remember that time in RE6 where Leon and Helena didnt get infected with C-virus because the jeep they rode in didnt turn the AC on

[3:42:32] <%Laecerelius> RE8 WITH WEREWOLF WESKER CONFIRMED
[3:42:33] <%krawtch> i think its implied the rockets pierce his face
[3:42:33] <+rascalrebel> because this game had low production value
[3:42:33] <$Draylle> they still splode tho
[3:42:33] <TheyCallMeVawn> EXPLOSIONS DONT NEED A DIRECT HIT
[3:42:33] <KeiPrime> incase they want him bck
[3:42:33] <krymzen5> probably
[3:42:34] <+Andrizzleton> the best part of an RPG is if you miss...you don't really miss
[3:42:35] <%spiritofmojave> In canon he's not tho

[3:42:39] <StalwartZephyr> eh, blast radius is good enough
[3:42:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> pretty sure they go THROUGH him
[3:42:41] <%rytyoung> RPGS ARE HARD TO AIM I PLAY COD I KNOW
[3:42:41] <gekizenbu> it doesnt matter because WESKER'S NUT LIVES ON
[3:42:42] <cesare92x> have you guys played the dlc with jill and Josh?
[3:42:42] <Mechazoic_Era> I mean it's rockets. they don't need to hit spot on to work
[3:42:43] <%AncelDeLambert> humans float on lava, it's massively more dense than us
[3:42:44] <samuelfisk> Riiiiiiiiiight
[3:42:45] <%patriotrenegade> He made a shell like a crab and survived @PatStaresAt
[3:42:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> They take his face... off
[3:42:45] <%heartlesshealer> for fun because it's RE
[3:42:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> For sure

[3:42:48] <evbites> his head could fly off
[3:42:48] <%lionandfox21> SLOW DOWN TIME
[3:42:48] <$ItsRatman> Its hard to aim in a rocking helicopter okay???

[3:42:52] <xeros720> splashed the lava on him
[3:42:53] <WaningScythe> He lives on in Jake Mueller LUL
[3:42:53] <%cureneckbeard> surely two rockets would cancel each other out

[3:43:06] <%lionandfox21> WTF?

[3:43:13] <%heartlesshealer> psaWrong
[3:43:14] <+eggstyr0ne> wesker floats in outer space until he stops thinking
[3:43:14] <Jetsfantasy> It is then that Wesker replaced his skin with armor, like a crab, moving airbubbles to the surface of the armor and rapidly regenerating it
[3:43:15] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt re4 is multiple days

[4:02:40] <%lionandfox21> OR THEY STOLE HIS DNA
[4:02:40] <Psych_man13_13> I doubt he even jerked it
[4:02:40] <derap41> Osmosis 100%
[4:02:41] <neVan0> LUL LUL LUL
[4:02:42] <%worldbrand> He probably didn't even need a dick
[4:02:42] <DandyMackeroos> It’s probably test tube baby
[4:02:42] <%Dragon_Batman> Man this would be a kool experiment -- said Wesker
[4:02:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> PAIGE IS WESKERS DAUGHTER
[4:02:44] <%torontototoro> Wesker died a virgin confirmed
[4:02:44] <%conradical> dumped the paint
[4:02:45] <Firesparks> REDFIELD POSTING
[4:02:46] <+klassikFrank> So he's like Palpatine?
[4:02:48] <%tusk102> he threw it onto a flower and it made a baby
[4:02:49] <%Voidwyvern> Voidwyvern subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! Hey Pat, love you and Peach. Hope you both keep being lovely people. Pet the baby when you can and have a wonderful evening
[4:02:49] <%D3rrtyD4n> thats not how any of this works psaWhat
[4:02:50] <+mushymoto> atpRtsd
[4:02:51] <%rytisone> Wesker was young once too
[4:02:52] <+Ell1ot> Pat! you forgot the turkey baster
[4:02:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh god the revelation 2 opening
[4:02:53] <Djinnazz> I don't even think he can, he's a weird mutant
[4:02:57] <eyedol33> COME ON
[4:02:59] <DandyMackeroos> That should just work in RE
[4:02:59] <+Restartist> I think that's how it works
[4:03:00] <Clu_Flynn> Jake is a redhead, Wesker banged a redhead. Excella died because she had black hair Wesker no like
[4:03:01] <gade177> Evil flowers? You guy's been playing Undertale?
[4:03:01] <%KeystoneA1> @Blue_Tunic_Link Would plow.
[4:03:03] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I mean, Angus fucks and so does Vergil
[4:03:05] <Pwgregory> Jake’s mother probably stuck a fist up his ass and collected the juice after.
[4:03:07] <%depressed_skeleton> I like skulls
[4:03:07] <+Dr_Mooose> It looks cool
[4:03:08] <+Skwizgarr> Leon "This Dong for Ada Wong" Kennedy
[4:03:10] <%jotarokujo1010> Jake's mom is Ada
[4:03:11] <%Monkeyweed21> he used the force to impregnate someone
[4:03:11] <+klassikFrank> I bet Wesker dumps paint by the pallet full
[4:03:17] <xeros720> complete global ejaculation
[4:03:23] <gade177> Have fun fucking.
[4:03:24] <%D3rrtyD4n> la-di-da
[4:03:25] <%ssjklyco> Capcom is a sexless universe
[4:03:31] <peachy996> I bet Jake's mother looked like a female version of Chris and that was the deciding factor for Wesker
[4:03:36] <%DonatelloJose> DonatelloJose subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Did we reach GLOBAL SATURATION?
[4:03:37] <%krawtch> Barry fucks
[4:03:38] <%ShichiNoBushi> Fee-ohn-seh
[4:03:38] <%chambatron> IS ANYBODY IN THE RE UNIVERSE CIRCUMCISED? @PatStaresAt
[4:03:39] <graemecrackers1> Ron Paul is dreamy <3
[4:03:44] <%jotarokujo1010> I bet Jake's mom was the Nero's mom
[4:03:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYEYEYE
[4:03:51] <%ElenaManetta> Eh
[4:03:51] <black_pariah> the root of that ongoing joke is jill and chris are so regularly infected they became sterile
[4:03:53] <StalwartZephyr> Konosuba is so good
[4:03:54] <+glgzephyr> Wesker yells out CHRIIIISSSS when he cums
[4:03:55] <SkyPirateArcane> It's fuckin great
[4:03:57] <%ElenaManetta> It doesn't have an "ending"
[4:03:59] <%fairore> @peachy996 oh God tomboy chris NotLikeThis
[4:04:00] <DandyMackeroos> @ssjklyco Is there really no intimate interaction in Capcom in general?
[4:04:01] <%SvenHolgersson> Beastars is the GOAT
[4:04:02] <benjiFG> beastars goes hard
[4:04:02] <+JavaManJoJo> Beastars is so good
[4:04:03] <%CopperTucker> my cat is yelling at ghosts, as he should
[4:04:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> KONOSUBA is GREAT
[4:04:05] <%Oxybe> Konosuba is gold
[4:04:05] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt woolie just made a post that just says "pray for street fighter". ALSO beastars is so fuckin good
[4:04:05] <neVan0> YEAH
[4:04:06] <+senfood> That's a good ass trade.
[4:04:10] <+necrocannibal2> @chambatron I bet Wesker had to circumcise frequently
[4:04:11] <%conradical> paige is gonna watch konosuba and just realize she is Aqua
[4:04:13] <%D3rrtyD4n> omg
[4:04:13] <%InugamiTheHound> beastars

[4:05:15] <%tusk102> GARBAGE
[4:05:15] <onionfryman> GayPride
[4:05:15] <peachy996> Pat is Will but Paige is Jack
[4:05:16] <%D3rrtyD4n> karin is awesome
[4:05:16] <Djinnazz> but yeah, that show is 90's bad.
[4:05:17] <gade177> Damn.
[4:05:18] <thickshield> hey, kinsey scale and what not
[4:05:18] <HyperBomb21> atpCap
[4:05:20] <%cureneckbeard> daww
[4:05:21] <+eggstyr0ne> Pat "I am less gay" Bovin
[4:05:23] <+klassikFrank> Remember when we found out Will & Grace was an isekai
[4:05:24] <DandyMackeroos> I mean your gay for Eyepatch Wolf
[4:05:25] <neVan0> LUL
[4:05:25] <%heartlesshealer> Pat, you are handsome to gays. I can confirm this
[4:05:26] <%MonsieurHedge> i ship Pat and Astolfo

[4:05:32] <%lionandfox21> I've never seen Will &Grace
[4:05:33] <%ssjklyco> @DandyMackeroos I dont think I've seen any sexual intimacy in capcom games. Dark stalkers is probably sexless as well
[4:05:34] <%Theycallmenerf> LUL
[4:05:35] <leinadtonu> so, just like this then.
[4:05:42] <$Mekhet09> Ot
[4:05:44] <%NotGran> NotGran subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! "Yes"
[4:05:48] <$Mekhet09> It's pretty outdated.
[4:05:50] <%cureneckbeard> Can we get Pat and Paige doing a Kazuma and Aqua cosplay duo? :I I'll chip in to make this happen
[4:05:54] <%Shadowpint> Yup heartless is right Pat is v handsome to gays
[4:05:57] <%SoFarFetched> IS THAT WHERE SHE LEARNED ANGELS ARE DEAD PEOPLE
[4:05:57] <Pwgregory> Paige is Jack.
[4:05:59] <DandyMackeroos> @ssjklyco Well, Morrigan is a succubus, but yeah.
[4:06:00] <%Monkeyweed21> does ANY capcom game have sex in it
[4:06:00] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I was 3
[4:06:09] <peachy996> No way

[4:06:21] <%ElenaManetta> I still think Seinfeld holds up without a phone
[4:06:22] <SkyPirateArcane> Push Seinfeld down a cliff while on fire please
[4:06:23] <NBD_Rab> Friends is more dated than Seinfeld
[4:06:23] <%K2YP70C0CK> jack 💳 karens tits & ass
[4:06:26] <%Oxybe> ;ol
[4:06:28] <%ElenaManetta> A lot of the stuff is stupid stuff I still do or talk about
[4:06:30] <%ssjklyco> @DandyMackeroos I feel like she is not a good succubus because she don't do the sex
[4:06:30] <peachy996> It's crazy how outdated Friends is
[4:06:30] <%trustycoyote> Paige: Have you watched Crazy Ex-Girlfriend?
[4:06:33] <+necrocannibal2> Seinfeld is the only 90's sitcom that holds up
[4:06:34] <gade177> Seinfeld is shit.
