[0:36:51] <%ArcanumArcanum> Pat have you tried the challenges? One of them is just Crazy Taxi

[0:37:20] <Sunstalker> Robot_Nixon_ Sony bought them at some point
[0:37:21] <$dalmek> oh shit does that mean we can get an actual "F to Pay Respects" moment?
[0:37:21] <%jarednotwithsubway> the endgame guns are VERY NICER
[0:37:22] <%Magewart> @Robot_Nixon_ Sony did give a Triple A exculsive to No Mans Sky and we all know how that went, Sony just been like that
[0:37:22] <%scaryboisupreme> yeah is the game fun

[0:40:46] <%KishinGrek> Kenny or Copeland, who's more annoying?
[0:40:46] <ARDM112> Oregon has no history, unrealistic game
[0:40:49] <%Magewart> "its very interesting"
[0:40:49] <%AzureGale> Do fighting game players congregate at the salt springs?
[0:40:52] <%Monkeyweed21> @GenesisKnight who is Woolie
[0:40:53] <Mr_JustinJones> But what if your dead wife was a zambi?

[0:41:05] <+MelodyMedley> A lotta zambos
[0:41:05] <LunarRemix> So is there any gimmick to this game's gameplay or is it just generic 3rd person action shoter?
[0:41:06] <+pyurient> god this voice acting is not great
[0:41:07] <jc_chance> Patrick plays ze bad game
[0:41:07] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[0:41:08] <%Mr_Pylon> wow he loves it
[0:41:13] <%Riecharus> Did you find any hordes off camera?
[0:41:14] <%ArcanumArcanum> Deacon has no chill
[0:41:15] <myriad_truth> Oh Pat, did you know clearing infestions allow fast travel?
[0:41:16] <%Valdorick> There is no Deacon Chill
[0:41:17] <+democrazyyy> tomatoSN tomatoSNEE tomatoPuke

[0:41:24] <Dunmarkh> it's a zambo apocaplypse he can't relax
[0:41:29] <%dewy_516> pat canonically can't not ride a bike
[0:41:34] <%ArcanumArcanum> @pyurient lol you're wrong the VA does a great job being crazy
[0:41:38] <jc_chance> Do you get ur pat he is crazy
[0:41:42] <SovPho> I like this VA tbh
[0:41:43] <$lotharrio> What are they called in this again? Freakers?
[0:41:44] <%jarednotwithsubway> deek is kinda off his shit
[0:41:44] <Profmcstevie> Deacon is fairly unremarkable in story cutscenes, why is he a muttering crazy in gameplay
[0:41:45] <%Broken_Sonex> Decan is.....fucking nuts
[0:41:45] <Mundkipz> is this game only good on pc?  how is it on ps4/5?
[0:41:50] <jc_chance> Please god
[0:41:51] <%dewy_516> do a flip
[0:41:54] <+Rachet20> @pyurient You liar, Sam Witwer kills it as Deacon
[0:41:55] <Aydarkzero> yeah Freakers
[0:41:55] <+pyurient> love the wheels clipping into the ground
[0:41:59] <$Afterman_> @ArcanumArcanum truth. Sam Witwer is a masterclass. hes fucking maul for christ sakes
[0:42:02] <+democrazyyy> sam witwer is so good at playing crazy people
[0:42:03] <+MelodyMedley> Yep. Freddy Freakers
[0:42:03] <Dunmarkh> @lotharrio FREAKERGANG RISE UP

[0:42:09] <Maids4lyfe> you mean the oregon trail?
[0:42:09] <%jarednotwithsubway> @Mundkipz performance suffers on ps4 tbh
[0:42:12] <TheViltsuZ> @jc_chance Biomutant is fun, just a bit unpolished at the moment. Which is kinda understandable as it's made by 20 people.
[0:42:13] <$RealThiele> mostly desert in the east
[0:42:13] <Aydarkzero> Sam is great man
[0:42:16] <MelonSouda> Hot springs episode boys!
[0:42:19] <scarman125> it's still pretty good on ps4. I've had relatively few performance issues
[0:42:22] <%Monkeyweed21> this isnt a desert
[0:42:23] <deviljhojho_> Deacon youre fucking crazy
[0:42:26] <%AncelDeLambert> THAT'S MY WIFE, CRONE!
[0:42:28] <Sunstalker> Does anybody take motorcycle people outside of other motorcycle people? kinamaHmm
[0:42:29] <+AtomicUncoolguy> AtomicUncoolguy subscribed with Prime. 
[0:42:29] <$Afterman_> @Mundkipz I played close to day 1. I enjoyed my time with it. but I just bought it on pc too
[0:42:35] <%valriot> Nero LUL
[0:42:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> he really is insane huh
[0:42:42] <Mundkipz> @jarednotwithsubway  how about ps5?
[0:42:45] <mr_saturday93> it's shit
[0:42:46] <SovPho> @myriad_truth actually he probably has Moral Injury Syndrome considering his role in Tucker's camp.
[0:42:46] <%dewy_516> dude is super angry huh
[0:42:46] <Maids4lyfe> I KNOW
[0:42:48] <jc_chance> Deacon is so cra cra

[0:43:13] <%jarednotwithsubway> @Mundkipz from what ive seen it runs fine, as long as you have one lol
[0:43:15] <%Magewart> Love this new last of us DLC
[0:43:15] <jc_chance> pAtrick Patrick Pat Zo
[0:43:23] <$RealThiele> boozer certainly wont die
[0:43:29] <jc_chance> Bitch shut yo a-
[0:43:34] <%BoxNavy> yes
[0:43:34] <BlueLunecy> When he talks like that he SOUNDS super crazy, but the stuff he says isn't really crazy
[0:43:37] <%jarednotwithsubway> yeah definitely
[0:43:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> Boozer is totally dead huh
[0:43:38] <+democrazyyy> its a good knife
[0:43:40] <Aydarkzero> just jam it in there it will unlock easily
[0:43:41] <SovPho> @PatStaresAt You probably know this already, but if it's "important dialogue" then it can usually be interrupted and will continue later.
[0:43:41] <%ArcanumArcanum> It's a mithril knife, it's fine
[0:43:41] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Agreed
[0:43:42] <%NateyBeak> magic deacon knife
[0:43:43] <willtheprofessional> "out in the shit" is what clued me in to Deacon being military. Lot of his lingo is a big giveaway.
[0:43:43] <+democrazyyy> made of dwarven mythril
[0:43:47] <%MrMegaJackpots> so is deacon supposed to sound crazy? cuz if so that's pretty good
[0:43:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> video games
[0:43:48] <%dewy_516> good knife
[0:43:50] <%s1rcuit> idk about instantly, but it'll break soon
[0:43:51] <Mundkipz> cool thx!
[0:43:52] <%acridpaladin> you dont?
[0:43:53] <Sunstalker> They should have just put a crowbar on his bike
[0:43:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> as you do
[0:43:57] <Dunmarkh> he's got high inland empire pat
[0:43:59] <%Broken_Sonex> He's fucking Crazy
[0:43:59] <%dewy_516> bottles have character!
[0:43:59] <andrewofbob> If he's talking to bottle,s then he's probably already drunk
[0:44:00] <VirtuaRailith> I heard zombie noises and thought it was Zangief
[0:44:01] <%valriot> So is this game about playing as an anti-masker or something
[0:44:01] <$lotharrio> No, it's a cutscene knife. The sturdiest, deadliest weapon on Earth.
[0:44:06] <bob900000> so what part of Oregon does this game take place
[0:44:07] <%Valdorick> You don't talk to bottles?
[0:44:09] <%HollowBeansVG> is the gameplay at least fun?
[0:44:10] <%ArcanumArcanum> Use your rocks Pat
[0:44:12] <Aydarkzero> any cool stealth kills in this?
[0:44:13] <+slickrick1121> yes, its a vidja game
[0:44:13] <%Deft_Thought> There are very few games where you wouldn't obliterate your equipment with the way most characters use them in games
[0:44:15] <%asgard147> He has to show the bottles he's theeir BETTER Pat
[0:44:19] <%BoxNavy> what a idiot lol
[0:44:19] <%NateyBeak> that freaker looks like me at 3am getting shredded cheese out of the fridge
[0:44:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> USE YOUR ROCKS
[0:44:23] <ralphfromdk> Dude as been mostly alone except for Bozzer. AND he's a vet with heavy ptsd  Of course he's weird.
[0:44:23] <nomnombear64> its ok knife made out of biker energy
[0:44:24] <Profmcstevie> Dude I talk to bottles, that's not weird we all talk to ourselves and inanimate objects
[0:44:24] <Estuko> reload your brick
[0:44:25] <SovPho> rocks are mvp
[0:44:26] <JittersCaffeine> Yeah, get your rocks off
[0:44:26] <%dewy_516> look at this nerd, he can't even speak to bottles
[0:44:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> who me?
[0:44:30] <Aydarkzero> in rock we trust
[0:44:30] <marcomatame> this game looks like the most 7th gen thing ever
[0:44:32] <BlueLunecy> That's barely even a zombie. That dudes looked like a methhead
[0:44:35] <myriad_truth> Nah, its definitely PTSD
[0:44:39] <+democrazyyy> @PatStaresAt have you encountered hordes yet?
[0:44:39] <%dewy_516> ROCK
[0:44:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> He’s probably imagining the whole thing and just shaving hikers
[0:44:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> You're welcome
[0:44:41] <MelonSouda> Rocks rock :)
[0:44:41] <$RealThiele> if you had to have me guess a real place in oregon this took place. im saying either bend or medford
[0:44:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat its the zombie apocalypse. Theyre all a bit crazy
[0:44:45] <%Valdorick> Rocks have failed us again
[0:44:45] <%BoxNavy> throw a rocks at that guy
[0:44:46] <$lotharrio> Rocks!
[0:44:50] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[0:44:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[0:44:55] <$Afterman_> whoops
[0:44:55] <BreakersAweigh> LUL
[0:44:56] <%dewy_516> ROCK!
[0:44:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ROC
[0:44:58] <andrewofbob> Betrayed by a rock
[0:45:01] <SovPho> you can throw an infinite amount of rocks to distract and infinite amount of enemies
[0:45:01] <%dewy_516> MY BEST friends
[0:45:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> It changes
[0:45:03] <%Frodiddly> good job rocks
[0:45:04] <$apolitenoob> Good start, good start
[0:45:04] <%Broken_Sonex> Patrick.....
[0:45:07] <+MelodyMedley> LUL
[0:45:09] <%AncelDeLambert> OKAY. GET SAHRYUS
[0:45:10] <jc_chance> Rock failure
[0:45:13] <%Magewart> that didnt rocl
[0:45:15] <Sunstalker> You stood right in it's sightline LUL
[0:45:17] <%AncelDeLambert> U DED
[0:45:17] <jorniev> and lack of cover
[0:45:19] <$lotharrio> Friendship with rocks is over. Nailbat is my new best friend.
[0:45:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's not always X, and it's way too small to see clearly fast enough
[0:45:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:45:28] <willtheprofessional> @RealThiele My money is on Bend
[0:45:29] <RetributionP> good Ole biker vision
[0:45:29] <%dirkfunk1> i had such high hopes for ROCKS
[0:45:30] <jc_chance> Pat didn’t rock & roll
[0:45:31] <%dewy_516> wow that really rocked huh guys!
[0:45:33] <+MelodyMedley> Biker vision!
[0:45:35] <+pyurient> this feels looks and plays like an early 360 title
[0:45:36] <%Mr_Pylon> how does Deacon's vision rank against other game visions?
[0:45:44] <$Afterman_> Also, everyone should go check out the album of Deacon's voiceactor, Revenge of the Crashtones
[0:45:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's a single player game dude, what do you expect?
[0:45:48] <jorniev> i like that
[0:45:48] <SovPho> god he talks a lot but he's not fucking intolerable about it imo
[0:45:51] <+ttvp> Some people just talk to themselves, I do it sometimes
[0:46:02] <Aydarkzero> it's a more insane version of re2 when Leon & Claire freak out in enemy encounters
[0:46:02] <NeonBleu> Zombie apocalypse would do that to you
[0:46:02] <%Monkeyweed21> sounds like Oregon
[0:46:03] <%AncelDeLambert> he's the guy from the Exploding Varmits video
[0:46:03] <myriad_truth> Its how he handles stress
[0:46:04] <%dewy_516> "I could find a use for this"
[0:46:05] <%W1nterTitan> Sam Witwer made that dude crazy
[0:46:06] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @patstaresat what skills do you have?
[0:46:07] <TheViltsuZ> I remember when the chat was shitting on this game for no reason and now that Pat likes it people like it as well...
[0:46:10] <%dewy_516> he says as he finds a leaf
[0:46:12] <jorniev> biker vision
[0:46:12] <%s1rcuit> you can upgrade the vision
[0:46:12] <SovPho> it's pretty shit dude it doesn't really tell you much
[0:46:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> it can highlight enemies later so that's good
[0:46:16] <jc_chance> Not as bad as the Biomutant narrator
[0:46:16] <bob900000> does he repeat himself alot?
[0:46:18] <%jarednotwithsubway> once you can see enemies with it it becomes infinitely more useful
[0:46:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> It has upgradees
[0:46:23] <%Monkeyweed21> Deacon probably did a lot of meth before the zambows came
[0:46:23] <%Magewart> loving that batman detective vision
[0:46:24] <balthazar758> he's his own hype man
[0:46:26] <Aydarkzero> you got his ankle real good there
[0:46:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> Go for the shins!!!
[0:46:31] <$lotharrio> Out in the shit, dealing with freakers, fighting off rock betrayals.
[0:46:32] <%Puhff> it'd be more realistic if he just unintelligibly grumbled sometimes instead of saying actual words
[0:46:32] <$Afterman_> @TheViltsuZ been a fan day 1. Always had good taste
[0:46:37] <%dewy_516> get juked!
[0:46:40] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Good roll Pat
[0:46:41] <+Exicuren> The dude is quite crazy, I would say that all that talking is what keeps him as sane as possible
[0:46:46] <%dewy_516> straight footisies
[0:46:49] <reddpop_> @TheViltsuZ its almost as if chat is made up of people with different opinions. this game still looks like shit though
[0:46:50] <$Afterman_> also deacon did no meth as far as the game shows
[0:46:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> I got that upgrade first
[0:46:55] <%ArcanumArcanum> Biker vision is super good when you upgrade it
[0:46:55] <Flame_Water> thqts what she said
[0:46:56] <Maids4lyfe> is it drugs?
[0:46:59] <SovPho> last longer, highlight enemies
[0:47:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> Cuz it doesn't last nearly long enough
[0:47:00] <%asgard147> To be fair, you'd might not so sane after a zomi-uh, I mean, FREAKER plague
[0:47:05] <myriad_truth> Why would the game need to tell you why a guy is going nuts in the ZOMBIE APOCOLYPSE??
[0:47:06] <%Broken_Sonex> Out in the shit dealing with all of these Freddie Freakers
[0:47:07] <+abrupt_abe> @PatStaresAt Do you like Deacon's actor more as Deacon or Starkiller from Force Awakens?
[0:47:18] <AdeptusExterminatus> radio copeland LUL
[0:47:20] <%dewy_516> yet again pat is just terrible at stealth when he can't just go invisible
[0:47:24] <$Afterman_> @abrupt_abe As Maul

[0:47:25] <jc_chance> Goodbye Patrick
[0:47:27] <%king_wragles> The freaker is your wife?
[0:47:33] <$dalmek> what's the zambo equivalent to freaker? freako? just freak?
[0:47:38] <Aydarkzero> I can't believe Pat is just quoting Deacon now
[0:47:39] <%Monkeyweed21> there should be more games where you play as a deranged addict
[0:47:40] <%JoshManVGH> Is this a Rage Zombies situation, vs undead decaying zombies?
[0:47:40] <%BoxNavy> he should say something everytime he swings his weapon
[0:47:41] <deviljhojho_> mrgrmgrmgrmfreaker tomatoPunished
[0:47:49] <ELFucilaNeroIV> That's literally the game
[0:47:50] <brachydios777> Freaker is the worst zombie name
[0:47:58] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> I can't believe they missed out on the best title for this game, Deacon and the Freakazoids
[0:47:59] <+pyurient> constantly sounds like hes sleeptalking

[0:49:24] <+MelodyMedley> What are you talking about Deacon?
[0:49:25] <%BoxNavy> i wasnt expecting him to go on for that long
[0:49:26] <JittersCaffeine> Is he tweaking? It would make sense if he was a tweaker.
[0:49:27] <%dewy_516> that doesn't know how to talk to their child
[0:49:27] <%Deft_Thought> You ever get into an argument and keep replaying it in your mind but with better comebacks? That's Deacon.
[0:49:29] <%Broken_Sonex> This is honestly great. He's so fucking crazy
[0:49:29] <balthazar758> dude loves some rambling

[0:49:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nooo buffering cuz of this stupid rain storm
[0:49:32] <jorniev> Honestly sounds  totally understable that deacon would turn into a crazy person that mumbles weird shit to himself after years of running around killing people
[0:49:33] <+DynDimAcsiwn> is that what they're actually going for???
[0:49:35] <+abrupt_abe> How many drugs is Deacon on?

[0:51:22] <AdeptusExterminatus> YE YE YE
[0:51:22] <SovPho> I like how the description of the .22 is "it's pretty shit, probably takes more than one shot to the head to kill something" and is promptly fucking amazing
[0:51:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> Use suppressor on gun
[0:51:25] <$RealThiele> ive seen that woman walking around

[0:51:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> did you get the crossbow one shot yet?
[0:51:54] <%dewy_516> looks like crap to go through
[0:51:57] <%dewy_516> but it looks cool
[0:51:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Focus is good for the first few before they know you're there
[0:52:02] <ELFucilaNeroIV> I wish that menu had night mode
[0:52:08] <$Afterman_> cant wait for pat to see the hordes
[0:52:10] <tanarath> He's just oregon's ichiban
[0:52:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> You didn't get the suppressors?!?
[0:52:13] <alexandrecau> reminds me of the mad max fury road game
[0:52:17] <$valo_ny> Did you mean to throw the attractor?
[0:52:19] <+evbites> Imagine if deacon had an Ellie or aterus that would be the worst for that kid
[0:52:20] <%dewy_516> u don't need eyes
[0:52:25] <%dewy_516> embrace light mode
[0:52:26] <alexandrecau> just more gun and less brutality
[0:52:27] <$Afterman_> @tanarath thats fairly accurate. Deacon is a biker bimbo
[0:52:32] <$Afterman_> all he cares about is WIFE
[0:52:39] <$happyface699> Focus becomes essential for hordes later

[0:52:47] <andrewofbob> Eternal group hugs
[0:52:50] <brachydios777> Man, Deacon seems like a cool character, would be ashamed if he got killed in the first hour of a sequel
[0:52:53] <AdeptusExterminatus> I'll do everything for my dead wife
[0:52:55] <$dalmek> ammo conservation to make sure you have enough for the Freakerz. Call that Freakonomics
[0:52:59] <corn_dad> Deacon is Fenix, but without the fun and lightheartedness
[0:53:02] <%dreadedcthulhu> shouts out to whoever gifted me the other day (y)
[0:53:06] <alexandrecau> I mean it wouldn't just be his wife's grave

[0:54:49] <Grennold> Pat's a freaker monkaS
[0:54:50] <$lotharrio> That really looked like a kidney stab.
[0:54:50] <ralphfromdk> @PatStaresAt Oh yeah, be prepared to kill zombie kids in this game LUL
[0:54:50] <+chiazam> WHYYYY

[0:54:52] <deviljhojho_> THESE CUTS
[0:54:52] <%Teintstein> these edits are dog shit
[0:54:54] <+MisterAvry> the olllld fake zombie child crying stab routine!
[0:54:54] <+MelodyMedley> This game is the best
[0:54:54] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Scene direction is very jarring in this game
[0:54:55] <alexandrecau> neck is worse
[0:54:56] <%dewy_516> CRACK ZOMBIES AT IT AGAIN
[0:54:56] <+BlockingDisabled> Why are they sitting around talking when the world is burning around them?
[0:54:57] <%Deft_Thought> These cuts are so awkward
[0:54:58] <%ArcanumArcanum> it's frantic memories
[0:54:59] <%toastybites> the stabbo cut
[0:55:02] <%BoxNavy> this game is so cool
[0:55:03] <+Rachet20> @patstaresat It was one of the kid creamers. You’ve fought them
[0:55:04] <Grennold> Just walk off the abdomenal wound 4Head
[0:55:04] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> These cut are crazy
[0:55:05] <KCfusecoast> ZOMBIE goblin child
[0:55:06] <%Daxalog> GOTTA KEEP THE PACE UP.
[0:55:06] <+thecosmicfly> This super feels like it was meant to be playable at one point
[0:55:06] <+abrupt_abe> Little goblin
[0:55:07] <PrinceOfEden> @brachydios777 Yeah that would be awful. I really hope they don't also advertise it like he'll be there the whole time and also omit more than half the game from us.
[0:55:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> NOT ENOUGGH MONEY
[0:55:10] <%dewy_516> she should of just parried it's just a kid
[0:55:10] <%AncelDeLambert> she's way too blase about this
[0:55:11] <jorniev> CUT GAMEPLAY!?
[0:55:12] <%MechArch> gotta go fast
[0:55:13] <%Teintstein> why did they capitalize Goddamn?
[0:55:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THIS IS THE BEST
[0:55:14] <%Daxalog> Wish BIO MUTANT moved this fast.
[0:55:15] <%dewy_516> like come on lol
[0:55:16] <alexandrecau> why we need to get one
[0:55:16] <scarman125> memory is a hell of a drug
[0:55:18] <mattdaddyd101> it this game story good
[0:55:18] <BigColossus> 1 stab? no problem
[0:55:18] <brachydios777> Why the cuts?
[0:55:20] <%dewy_516> wirtle goblin
[0:55:20] <NeroInfinite> These cuts are weird man like there was supposed ot be SOMETHING there but it's gone now
[0:55:23] <i_chevalier> budget issues
[0:55:25] <%ZComiX> Budget go DOWN
[0:55:25] <Strider222> FREAKER GANG
[0:55:26] <+blacksoap65> Hurray Amerio jank!
[0:55:26] <friedsquidiot> These scenes really mess with my head because they did a really good job with the environment and i lived there
[0:55:26] <+fetrigon> ah she's fucked
[0:55:28] <LunarRemix> This feels like USAJank somehow
[0:55:28] <Link232> I was tempted to get this game but holy shit this cutscene kinda just convinced me otherwise
[0:55:29] <JittersCaffeine> These feel like they were part of a prologue that was cut and are being used as flashbacks now
[0:55:29] <$RealThiele> cuno wins
[0:55:30] <%Teintstein> this has got to be cut gameplay
[0:55:32] <+abrupt_abe> This is knockoff Sons of Anarchy meets Last of Us
[0:55:33] <Aydarkzero> They escaped i guess
[0:55:34] <deviljhojho_> Dunno lol
[0:55:35] <Grennold> Yeah I get the feeling there was supposed to be gameplay here
[0:55:35] <+fetrigon> huh?
[0:55:37] <lloyddboy> this seems like a level
[0:55:37] <$lotharrio> I think this was supposed to be playable... and they cut it later.
[0:55:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea it's the story of them getting there
[0:55:38] <Estuko> Are we going through a cutscene gallery??
[0:55:39] <+thecosmicfly> Days Gone more like Gameplay Gone
[0:55:41] <+sjay662> @mattdaddyd101 no, but Sam Witwer carries it hard.
[0:55:42] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Wasn't this game supposed to have dialog choices and morality system?
[0:55:43] <+AbnormalVoid> my little sister was also a goblin
[0:55:43] <%allups> its as if all the playable bits got cut
[0:55:44] <myriad_truth> But wait, theres more!
[0:55:44] <kikoeru_san> HIW
[0:55:46] <+SundanceShot> my little sister was also a goblin
[0:55:47] <kikoeru_san> HOW
[0:55:47] <jorniev> FEELINGS OF LACK OF MONEY
[0:55:48] <%dewy_516> this feels like a compliation
[0:55:48] <%AncelDeLambert> this is TERRIBLE
[0:55:48] <%Arancet> i could not be more emotionally uninvested
[0:55:49] <%Frodiddly> wow this is outrageously dumb
[0:55:49] <$dalmek> ruh roh
[0:55:49] <brachydios777> @princeofeden And replace him with a way blander character
[0:55:50] <kikoeru_san> when
[0:55:51] <+trackles_64> the gameplay is this games saving grace
[0:55:52] <alexandrecau> you had a boss fight with goblin kid that was cut
[0:55:53] <deviljhojho_> why did she even stab er
[0:55:54] <%Daxalog> Was there supposed to be gameplay there originally? And they just cut it?
[0:55:55] <+DynDimAcsiwn> days kino
[0:55:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> She gon' die
[0:55:56] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> "That hide and seek game", you know the one. Hide and seek.
[0:55:59] <deviljhojho_> hmmmmm i wonder
[0:56:00] <%Frodiddly> okay so she never made it alive to the camp right
[0:56:00] <jorniev> YEAH
[0:56:01] <%BoxNavy> true
[0:56:01] <lemon_lover28> yeah, seems like that
[0:56:02] <+AbnormalVoid> omg
[0:56:03] <LunarRemix> Yeah
[0:56:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh shit yea basically
[0:56:04] <%dewy_516> This feels like a cutscene only walkthrough on YouTube
[0:56:05] <friedsquidiot> This place is an rei irl
[0:56:06] <+MisterAvry> spot on
[0:56:06] <%AncelDeLambert> where's the lie
[0:56:06] <+evbites> holy shit this is all over the place.
[0:56:07] <%Deft_Thought> That's an interesting assessment
[0:56:07] <kikoeru_san> what is this, F91? these cuts are insane
[0:56:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> CUT GAMEPLAY LUL
[0:56:10] <i_chevalier> dlc???
[0:56:12] <LunarRemix> Would've been a flashback
[0:56:12] <+megaman_sentinel> he has an arm
[0:56:13] <Aydarkzero> seems really spot on actually
[0:56:14] <+abrupt_abe> That makes so much sense
[0:56:14] <%Monkeyweed21> same as the opening
[0:56:16] <%jarednotwithsubway> that actually makes a ton of sense
[0:56:16] <Grennold> Big Jim with the axe
[0:56:16] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Yeah I did read that they cut some stuff up.
[0:56:16] <kikoeru_san> it's literally Gundam F91
[0:56:17] <tanarath> big no money
[0:56:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Totally makes sense
[0:56:18] <Draco_Renegade> This definitely was suppose to be the tutorial
[0:56:18] <brachydios777> Yeah
[0:56:20] <+MisterAvry> hence the weird blackout cuts
[0:56:21] <+MelodyMedley> That seems pretty accurate
[0:56:22] <MarkUriah> yeah i can see it
[0:56:25] <+abrupt_abe> Original tutorial?
[0:56:25] <+fetrigon> yeah most def
[0:56:26] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> this game does have a lot of cut content
[0:56:28] <%dewy_516> They don't call them cutscenes for no reason
[0:56:28] <reddpop_> "Content Gone"
[0:56:28] <+evbites> omg those are gameplay fades
[0:56:29] <Grennold> "we don't need this shit" whack whack whack
[0:56:29] <KCfusecoast> Exactly
[0:56:29] <deviljhojho_> just another day in oregon
[0:56:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the start of the game was the same way
[0:56:30] <%BoxNavy> feels like watching a cutscene movie on youtube
[0:56:31] <%Teintstein> my favorite character! Scared Man
[0:56:33] <jorniev> NONE OF THIS IS NECESARY
[0:56:34] <%allups> crazy shit
[0:56:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea this part totally screams gameplay
[0:56:36] <%Magewart> This cutscene too damb long
[0:56:40] <+GenesisKnight> How did this make it in
[0:56:42] <srv4254> days before day 1 dlc?
[0:56:43] <PrinceOfEden> @brachydios777 Who's only perk is that they end up being inclusive in some sort of way which is their only defining feature.
[0:56:44] <%dewy_516> "content expunged"
[0:56:46] <Aydarkzero> Oh no he's wounded to bad we never found out how
[0:56:47] <nuane> it just keeps going
[0:56:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea that shoulda been gameplay
[0:56:48] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> With these weird cuts, that's a fuckin superb guess
[0:56:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> and this would be the stealth tutorial
[0:56:48] <Louie_Salmon> Wait how did he get there
[0:56:49] <+abrupt_abe> That was 100% supposed to be a sequence
[0:56:49] <%Mr_Pylon> this was totally the stealth tutorial
[0:56:50] <$lotharrio> Yeah this part was a stealth tutorial.
[0:56:50] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:56:51] <jorniev> WHY WASNT THIS CUT!?
[0:56:51] <+MisterAvry> yeah that was supposed to be a shootout
[0:56:52] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Woolie isn't real, you're all thinking of Wu-Li-Wu-Le-Wo
[0:56:53] <%Frodiddly> wow yeah this was totally supposed to be a tutorial
[0:56:53] <%dewy_516> holy crap
[0:56:54] <shadowboss89> Cutscene boss fight
[0:56:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> This guy

[0:57:54] <jorniev> the cuts are what make this really bad
[0:57:54] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> WE NEED TO EXPOSE QUICK
[0:57:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> EAT IT UP YOU MONKEY
[0:57:54] <%AzureGale> Get her into the NERD helicopter
[0:57:56] <Sunstalker> I kind of also just looks like they didn't get some sections of cutscenes finished and had to ship it
[0:57:58] <ELFucilaNeroIV> There so much happening in such a short period of time. It's like the game is off its rocker too
[0:58:00] <%dewy_516> THIS PLAYS LIKE A DREAM
[0:58:00] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Fuck I want to play this game now
[0:58:00] <KCfusecoast> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:58:01] <$lotharrio> Oh yeah, we DID see this part.
[0:58:01] <%Lion_kun> This is true art.
[0:58:01] <brachydios777> There was totally gameplay here!
[0:58:01] <chamblers> THIS FEELS LIKE A BUG BUT IT ISNT
[0:58:01] <%Arancet> i havent seen scene cuts this bad since i watched Miami Connection
[0:58:02] <deviljhojho_> this was probably a tutorial level yeah
[0:58:02] <i_chevalier> he has his wife name tattoo on his neck. in bold font lol
[0:58:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GIVE ME BACK MY SON
[0:58:02] <haydenfoxy> you're tearing me apart, Sarah!!
[0:58:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> This was the tutorial, for sure
[0:58:03] <JittersCaffeine> Like, I GUESS we're supposed to see that he had aversions to killing before the zombies.
[0:58:03] <SovPho> Better shaky cam than Outriders I tell you hwat
[0:58:04] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> is this what going insane feels like
[0:58:06] <tengel66> This is great lol
[0:58:08] <+razinmore> I remember the cuts being slower on ps4 or maybe I'm bugging
[0:58:09] <Grennold> Literally could've cut half this shit
[0:58:12] <%dewy_516> NO TRANSISTIONS JUST SCENE TO SCENE
[0:58:13] <%AzureGale> OH MY FUCKING GOD
[0:58:14] <%CalderGaming> hey chat has anyone other than Deacon physically seen Boozer in the "present" part of the game
[0:58:14] <KCfusecoast> Its sad tho
[0:58:17] <Louie_Salmon> This is insane
[0:58:18] <kikoeru_san> oh my god this makes Tomino's work in the 90s look stable
[0:58:20] <wibbwobbler> LUL
[0:58:21] <%DakotaMacDoodle> those fades were absolutely supposed to cut to gameplay
[0:58:22] <%dewy_516> "Transistions Gone"
[0:58:23] <%ArcanumArcanum> I fucking LOVE how O'Brian delivers "there are no more hospitals"
[0:58:23] <$Afterman_> he basically goes into Rick from TWD mode after this
[0:58:24] <+abrupt_abe> Why not kick the guy off?
[0:58:25] <+Exicuren> Fortunately, this os the only section with this weird as hell.cuts
[0:58:25] <%pyurient> pyurient subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! how did this game get greenlit??? also I hope gief is okay without his balls. Thanks for the streams!
[0:58:28] <myriad_truth> That would mess me up too
[0:58:28] <ThatGuyThere03> is pulling out the gun Deacon's only response to problems?
[0:58:31] <Mrrccava> this is absurdly bad lol
[0:58:35] <Blank9> this was the dumbest shit
[0:58:35] <%dewy_516> "gameplay gone"
[0:58:36] <+Ches_Neckbeard> didn't we already see this cutscene like three times?
[0:58:36] <Louie_Salmon> The only word I can use to describe this pacing is "Manic"
[0:58:38] <crocboyz> wait did he start over
[0:58:38] <nuane> Gameplay Gone
[0:58:39] <%CalderGaming> PAt At Risk
[0:58:39] <+eldragon_1> It's like an only cutscenes video on youtube
[0:58:41] <%za7az> LUL
[0:58:43] <%Mr_Pylon> why are we seeing this part again?
[0:58:43] <+chiazam> “There are no hospitals”
[0:58:44] <Mattais88> Again, why didn't friend get on the chopper
[0:58:44] <+trackles_64> so ded
[0:58:45] <$Afterman_> neither of them could make it out alive
[0:58:46] <BigColossus> Pat is going crazy
[0:58:48] <$Afterman_> by themselves
[0:58:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This is almost deadly premonition level jank
[0:58:50] <NeroInfinite> so get on it boozer
[0:58:50] <%dewy_516> "Pacing gone"
[0:58:50] <+evbites> @CalderGaming no there is no way that twist is real
[0:58:51] <%jarednotwithsubway> he'd refuse for sure
[0:58:52] <MarkUriah> lmao go with your wife
[0:58:52] <$SGrim> The boozer dies
[0:58:52] <%Deft_Thought> Man, Boozer is jacked
[0:58:53] <JittersCaffeine> Because that the DOOM choper fated to die
[0:58:53] <KCfusecoast> Yeah should have kicked the guy out
[0:58:56] <Grennold> Deek is too fat for rescue FeelsBadMan
[0:58:57] <alexandrecau> bro before wife
[0:58:58] <Aydarkzero> holy shit Boozer is actually OP
[0:58:58] <%JoshManVGH> Boozer is fucking deadweight
[0:58:59] <+MisterAvry> Bikers: Reach
[0:58:59] <$Afterman_> they NEED each other
[0:59:00] <Sunstalker> Is 1 person overweight really that big of a fueldrain on THAT chopper?
[0:59:02] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> boozer no
[0:59:03] <%allups> the shit is real
[0:59:03] <ralphfromdk> Then some one would be alone, and alone is very bad in the apocalypse.
[0:59:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why wouldn't he go?
[0:59:03] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Is this gonna end up in one of those I Am Legend chopper crashes out of nowhere? I might lose it.
[0:59:05] <DovaDude29> This is so bad good
[0:59:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh cuz of that
[0:59:07] <myriad_truth> Its because Deacon and Boozer don't like the government
[0:59:07] <SovPho> Because Boozer and Deacon's dynamic is explained over the course of the video game, albeit relatively poorly.
[0:59:08] <+AbnormalVoid> I love you Boozer m6kwSadbungle
[0:59:09] <Dunmarkh> no
[0:59:10] <+BlackSunEmperor> why are they playing the whole thing again?
[0:59:10] <%dewy_516> Biker bro boozer
[0:59:11] <JittersCaffeine> We don't need THIS part in the flashback
[0:59:13] <+MelodyMedley> Have you?
[0:59:15] <andrewofbob> Is this some CinamaSins supercut?
[0:59:17] <$Afterman_> then deacon would die
[0:59:18] <Strider222> no
[0:59:19] <hologram_sam> ???????
[0:59:20] <%QueequegTheater> He doesn't want to
[0:59:20] <%jarednotwithsubway> he'd say no
[0:59:20] <+Exicuren> You don't get it bro, they are bike brothers
[0:59:20] <%Teintstein> Three Fingered Jack
[0:59:20] <+SundanceShot> i will stay with you boozer, my biker wife
[0:59:21] <%dewy_516> he has a shotgun and nothing else
[0:59:21] <chamblers> ??????
[0:59:21] <KCfusecoast> Boozer is trying to be all badass and what not
[0:59:22] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> he gave her the huge ring
[0:59:23] <Estuko> h-he said there's room for 2 more people though
[0:59:23] <$lotharrio> Yeah... Boozer should be on the chopper.
[0:59:24] <$Afterman_> if they both go together they both live
[0:59:24] <JittersCaffeine> We already saw this part
[0:59:25] <+Exicuren> Kappa
[0:59:25] <$Afterman_> or one dies
[0:59:25] <MelonSouda> @CalderGaming Other people has asked Deacon where boozer is so I THINK he's real. He made it past the flashbakc at any rate.
[0:59:26] <%Deft_Thought> This is so weird
[0:59:27] <deviljhojho_> he doesnt trust the boozer
[0:59:27] <NeroInfinite> JUST PUT HIM ON THE CHOPPER THEN YA FOOL LUL
[0:59:27] <Dunmarkh> that fuckin ring

[0:59:31] <Sol_Install> this is dumb thinking about it now
[0:59:32] <PrinceOfEden> WHY NOT PUT HIM ON THE HELI?!
[0:59:32] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Deacon is being a dumb murder man
[0:59:32] <nuane> her ass is too fat, both of them cant fit
[0:59:33] <%allups> this big ugly ass tacky ring
[0:59:33] <%toastybites> thats such an edgy ring
[0:59:33] <%Bane_Kaikyo> the WIFE ring
[0:59:34] <%dewy_516> BOOZER CAN'T MAKE IT
[0:59:35] <+chiazam> WE DONT HAVE TIME FOR THIS
[0:59:35] <%JoshManVGH> Of all the rings on his hand he could give....
[0:59:35] <SovPho> It is *well established* that Deacon is a fucking moron.
[0:59:36] <KCfusecoast> Boozer didn’t go
[0:59:36] <%Daxalog> @PatStaresAt None of them would make it alone
[0:59:36] <ThatGuyThere03> was she not already wearing a fucking WEDDING BAND?
[0:59:37] <Sunstalker> PAT THEY CAN'T PUT BOOZER ON IT BECAUSE IT HAS TO CRASH FOR THE SAD DEAD WIFE BIT
[0:59:38] <KCfusecoast> Lmao

[1:00:00] <$dalmek> Honey this Hot Topic ring is my favourite PLEASE keep it safe I BEG You
[1:00:00] <+Rachet20> I don’t think Boozer would go without Deacon so Deek just goes with him

[1:00:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THERES NO TIME
[1:00:04] <%ClericOfSparda> That's the worst best scene ever
[1:00:05] <KCfusecoast> Lol
[1:00:05] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Grad student saying only two with a gun in his face, and deacon first hears 3, and then when boozer says 2 he hears 1
[1:00:07] <jorniev> GOD DAMMIT
[1:00:07] <%AzureGale> Looked like enough room in the choppa for one more :x
[1:00:07] <%BoxNavy> what DID he do
[1:00:08] <NeroInfinite> I wasn't evne here for the first stream and I can tell this is dumb right away
[1:00:08] <Kang_Artur> wait why didn't they put him on the helicopter?
[1:00:10] <%s1rcuit> this game is visibly affecting Pat's blood flow
[1:00:11] <%allups> cant belive they cut the playable bits
[1:00:12] <%Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt BUT PAT THE RING IS SO BIG
[1:00:12] <%pyurient> THE END
[1:00:13] <+AbnormalVoid> ...why is his wife dead?
[1:00:13] <KCfusecoast> 😂😂😂🤣
[1:00:13] <LunarRemix> - End of Cut Content -
[1:00:14] <JeysJumbleJams> PISS FILTER
[1:00:14] <+MisterAvry> so NEITHER of them?!
[1:00:15] <+evbites> this would have been cooler if we didn't see it first
[1:00:15] <jorniev> THIS WHOLE SEQUENCE SUCKS
[1:00:15] <+abrupt_abe> What was the point of that?
[1:00:15] <Estuko> I want the credits to roll, omg
[1:00:15] <%Buzzard42> didn't we already see that during the intro
[1:00:15] <alexandrecau> been boozer I would have killed myself just to show how stupid that is
[1:00:17] <%Teintstein> "keep this finger armor safe"
[1:00:18] <%dewy_516> What just happened
[1:00:19] <%vaporousTippler> End of non-level.
[1:00:19] <+chiazam> THE CHOPPER IS GONNA GET SHOT OUTTA THE SKY
[1:00:19] <JetpackMcQuack> and then she died
[1:00:20] <stantheman_97> her, honey, my favorite flavor of ring pop
[1:00:20] <brachydios777> Did he just bro before hos his wife?
[1:00:21] <+SocialMisfitGamer> SARAH
[1:00:21] <%dewy_516> MY WIFE
[1:00:22] <%Puhff> her model just looks like a soccer mom with a tattoo overlay
[1:00:22] <%Deft_Thought> THIS GAME
[1:00:22] <%Tman451> that looked like it was gonna cut to gameplay for sure
[1:00:23] <%Magewart> End of part 1
[1:00:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why do these two lover boys have to stick together wtf
[1:00:24] <+AbnormalVoid> is his wife even dead?
[1:00:24] <SovPho> If that ring was Mokume-gane you guys would be cooming over it
[1:00:24] <no123450n> *white trash beautiful plays*
[1:00:26] <+MidnightDeacon> The days truly are gone
[1:00:26] <%QueequegTheater> DEAD WIFE. SAD
[1:00:27] <+Exicuren> Deacon was not smart back then
[1:00:29] <jorniev> OH DEAR GOD ITS CUT GAMPLAY
[1:00:29] <%Frodiddly> ENJOY THIS ROCK DEAD WIFE
[1:00:30] <%dewy_516> what a beautiful flashback level
[1:00:32] <%QueequegTheater> THINK ABOUT WIFE
[1:00:32] <PrinceOfEden> Did they cut out all the gameplay parts of that?! LIKE WOW
[1:00:32] <deviljhojho_> uh
[1:00:32] <%StrawberryPantsu> FEEL SAD
[1:00:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why do they have to stick together. Makes no sense
[1:00:34] <Sunstalker> AbnormalVoid The crashed chopper. Right next to this stone
[1:00:34] <%JoshManVGH> So his wife is fucking dead?
[1:00:34] <nuane> huh? shes dead?
[1:00:34] <friedsquidiot> GAH THIS IS
[1:00:35] <KCfusecoast> Something very stupid 😂😂
[1:00:37] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> IS SHE EVEN DEAD?
[1:00:38] <deviljhojho_> holy moly
[1:00:39] <SovPho> @Exicuren oh he never gets smart
[1:00:40] <Grennold> 10/10 I CRY EVRY TIEM
[1:00:40] <MelonSouda> oh my god it started to fade into greyscale so the opening credits could roll over it.
[1:00:41] <Link232> I feel more insane knowing that cutscene even existed
[1:00:41] <kikoeru_san> That flash back was aaaaaaaawful
[1:00:42] <myriad_truth> You saw how Boozer treats his bandages, he wouldn't have gone on the chopper.
[1:00:42] <%Puhff> KILLED WIFE
[1:00:43] <+abrupt_abe> Nothing
[1:00:44] <$dalmek> it's like I said, my Days are Gone
[1:00:45] <JittersCaffeine> So what are the odds that his wife isn't actually dead and is only presumed dead?
[1:00:45] <%Puhff> THINK ABOUT WIFE
[1:00:45] <%Teintstein> I MEMBER
[1:00:47] <+fetrigon> MY WIIIIIIFE
[1:00:47] <+AbnormalVoid> oh lmao
[1:00:48] <Louie_Salmon> 25% wife memory complete
[1:00:48] <corn_dad> I can't believe you've done this
[1:00:49] <+thecosmicfly> 3000xp for remembering dead wife
[1:00:50] <ELFucilaNeroIV> That had to be playable at some point.
[1:00:50] <%allups> that was supposed to be a mission not a video
[1:00:50] <Mattais88> Boozer just thinking to himself "Wait I was trying to be honourable and shit and he stays? I could have gotten on that heli"
[1:00:51] <+MisterAvry> dude what if she's not dead
[1:00:53] <+trackles_64> Hot Spring Tub Stream?
[1:00:53] <%dewy_516> 'live with the fact that your wife only lives in the cut gameplay"
[1:00:54] <chamblers> literally what was that
[1:00:55] <+MelodyMedley> WHAT DID YOU DO?
[1:00:55] <$Afterman_> @KeiganOfAstora they needed both to survive. if either were alone they wouldnt have made it
[1:00:55] <+SocialMisfitGamer> I remember....YOU KILLED MY WIFE
[1:00:56] <BigColossus> make things worse
[1:00:57] <%ArcanumArcanum> visit wife's grave so the slave camp likes you more
[1:00:59] <%Monkeyweed21> THAT IS THE MOST CUT SHIT EVER
[1:01:00] <%topendbuzza> brodan what have you boys done
[1:01:00] <+D00msDayDan> can you visit her grave throughout the story for more dialogue like in horizon zero dawn?
[1:01:00] <%Teintstein> press X to think about wife
[1:01:03] <+xerioes> what did you do said man who is creating the problem
[1:01:03] <+fetrigon> WIIIIIIFE WIIIIIIFE WIIIIIIFE
[1:01:03] <+evbites> @JittersCaffeine 95%
[1:01:05] <LunarRemix> This game feels like American-Jank somehow
[1:01:05] <%MajorCrasher> assumed dead because he hasn't found her in 2 years chat
[1:01:06] <%Birdigalore> My crossbow is my dead wife!
[1:01:09] <nuane> Sarah died on the way to her home planet
[1:01:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Afterman_ Cuz of Boozer's injury? Then why not get on the chopper?
[1:01:15] <+projectmanatees> Boozer deserved better
[1:01:17] <jorniev> THAT WAS REALLY FUNNY
[1:01:19] <+ItalianWaifu> Did he tell Bozzer there was room for two?
[1:01:20] <%Monkeyweed21> this is MGS5 levels of cut content
[1:01:21] <friedsquidiot> They totally changed the name of the town that’s set in because it would be waaaay too real otherwise
[1:01:22] <+Exicuren> @sovpho I know, but at least crazy Deac is a bit more cunning
[1:01:23] <KCfusecoast> 🤭🤭No spoilers
[1:01:24] <%Mr_Pylon> can you shoot your wife's grave rock for funsies?
[1:01:29] <%dewy_516> visit your wife's grave to be reminded about how you're terrible at riddles
[1:01:29] <tengel66> having the choppy cuts was only acceptable in a "flashback" state, i guess
[1:01:30] <+beatswithkev> Why should we like Sony Bend again?
[1:01:32] <KCfusecoast> That was hilarious
[1:01:34] <%solracc25> oh map
[1:01:37] <srv4254> drive back here 10x for more of that trash
[1:01:37] <i_chevalier> did he get the ring back??
[1:01:38] <%ArcanumArcanum> Pat there's a car you can move
[1:01:39] <$Afterman_> @KeiganOfAstora because then DEACON would die. the point is that one person being alone, regardless of who, would die.
[1:01:40] <myriad_truth> Cause Boozer wouldn't have gotten on the chopper anyway
[1:01:40] <%dewy_516> SHOOT THE ROCK
[1:01:40] <willtheprofessional> go the other way pat, open the shortcut
[1:01:41] <Aydarkzero> isn't he by himself?
[1:01:46] <MarkUriah> @ItalianWaifu boozer TOLD DEACON there was room for 2
[1:01:46] <brachydios777> @lunarremix You assume wrong that America is immune to jank
[1:01:48] <+Exicuren> Go back, there's a shorcut
[1:01:48] <willtheprofessional> yeah, move tha car
[1:01:52] <jorniev> THAT WAS TERRIBLE DIRECTING
[1:01:53] <KCfusecoast> They should have edited that scene better
[1:01:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Afterman_ Pretty dumb LUL
[1:01:55] <%MassConnect> lol, I thought that said "Talk to truck"
[1:01:59] <%QueequegTheater> Shoot the green barrels
[1:02:01] <%Buzzard42> this game sucks ass in the best possible way
[1:02:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Go after the chopper
[1:02:03] <$lotharrio> I read the objective as "talk to truck" for a second and saw nothing wrong with it.
[1:02:08] <$Afterman_> @KeiganOfAstora best way to think of it lol
[1:02:10] <SovPho> @Exicuren idk how far you've gotten but the dumber definitely gets... hard.
[1:02:10] <Aydarkzero> Shortcut to wife
[1:02:17] <SovPho> err dumb*
[1:02:17] <%dewy_516> shoot the rock?
[1:02:22] <+BlackSunEmperor> is this a DARK SOUL?
[1:02:22] <%Mr_Pylon> you threw it earlier
[1:02:29] <ThatGuyThere03> is this just bootleg TLOU?
[1:02:31] <%BigCoffee> Is the game's sound super low?
[1:02:36] <Sunstalker> beatswithkev Because they actually made some good psp handheld games and the huge asshole dev is already fired way long ago. kinamaShrug
[1:02:37] <+thecosmicfly> Free Car
[1:02:38] <$lotharrio> Fuck you Freddy FREAKER!
[1:02:41] <Sol_Install> terrible
[1:02:42] <+AbnormalVoid> yeah
[1:02:45] <balthazar758> disjointed
[1:02:45] <Dunmarkh> no
[1:02:46] <Virokwet> ye
[1:02:46] <nuane> this is AMC's TLOU
[1:02:47] <+D00msDayDan> SUCK IT, FREAKER
[1:02:47] <andrewofbob> Why is he collecting ears?
[1:02:47] <%BoxNavy> nah
[1:02:47] <Sol_Install> yea it's low
[1:02:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> I agree
[1:02:48] <%topendbuzza> kinda yeah
[1:02:48] <deviljhojho_> Freak on this, bitch
[1:02:48] <%allups> yeah but when u buy it day one and buggy as shit like I did not so fun
[1:02:49] <DracaenaLeaf> story is biker trash
[1:02:49] <Louie_Salmon> A little, I guess
[1:02:49] <+wmeldrum> pretty low
[1:02:50] <%walternatorz> game audio is quiet
[1:02:51] <Blank9> a bit low
[1:02:52] <JeysJumbleJams> a little low yeah
[1:02:52] <%BigCoffee> I can barely hear the game, but I hear you
[1:02:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea, it's fun
[1:02:52] <%AncelDeLambert> Last of Us-ish?
[1:02:54] <LunarRemix> Yeah it's still a little bit low
[1:02:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> I guess
[1:02:56] <%chrisarithmetic> little bit yeah
[1:02:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Awful
[1:02:58] <scrumbotime> It's a Enjoyable Game Of Fun Buttons and a Dogshit Idiot Story For Fools you can laugh at
[1:02:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> a lil
[1:03:00] <Demon_chann> story gets better in my opinion
[1:03:02] <MelonSouda> gameplay wise it LOOKS pretty solid. and the port look exceptional. storywise though it's... definitely something.
[1:03:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> Go up a few notches
[1:03:05] <Louie_Salmon> But then when he screams at the radio it'll be way too loud
[1:03:05] <%BigCoffee> This is a lot funnier then last of us
[1:03:06] <+trackles_64> Deacon St John
[1:03:06] <SovPho> do you prefer Freaker or Hooligan virus
[1:03:06] <TheCoobie> Kinda? but its not a super loud game
[1:03:07] <+robo_trunk> The story does get better and worse overtime
[1:03:10] <Sol_Install> better~
[1:03:11] <dinnydanny777> "Can't save, not near bike or bed" is hilarious
[1:03:15] <willtheprofessional> @andrewofbob camps pay you for them, for making the surrounding area a little bit safer
[1:03:19] <$Afterman_> it gets WAY more interesting lol
[1:03:21] <beefcakemanthrob> i think the story does get better, but it takes a bit
[1:03:24] <%za7az> The government part of the story is pretty cool, but yeah, the rest is kinda lame
[1:03:24] <KCfusecoast> Playing it is fun but the Story that has alot of flaws
[1:03:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> I like when the game and you are even, if I'm honest
[1:03:27] <Demon_chann> also if so watch early gameplay this game had choices but they scrap em
[1:03:31] <%dewy_516> This reads like someone explained to someone else what walking dead was but they were thinking about Sons of Anarchy
[1:03:34] <TheMrFountain> I think that chopper scene comes down to Deek knowing the kind of guy Boozer is. Boozer likely wouldn't get on the chopper without Deacon either, and they both know that.
[1:03:37] <andrewofbob> I guess it's a system of depts and favours
[1:03:39] <+chiazam> Perfect
[1:03:39] <+Exicuren> @sovpho I beat the game, I mentioned cunning because hw has his moments
[1:03:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's not a door. This is a door!
[1:03:41] <Demon_chann> that why early story feel so weird
[1:03:43] <+trackles_64> has pat done a hord yet chat?
[1:03:46] <friedsquidiot> the landscaping they did is... phenomenal
[1:03:49] <%allups> the creatures are cool lore wise
[1:03:51] <JeysJumbleJams> like a b movie plot with solid execution
[1:03:51] <%Mr_Pylon> I like to think that Deacon is the only guy out here cutting ears and people just go with it
[1:03:52] <$spardanwarrior> Ear just flew into your pocket
[1:03:52] <i_chevalier> if we get to the end and the answer is ... aliens. I'm going to throw up. lol
[1:03:54] <+Rachet20> The best parts of the story are definitely in the latter acts
[1:03:56] <%dewy_516> game look cool
[1:04:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Grab that fuel for your bike
[1:04:03] <%QueequegTheater> I think every zombie game should have a third person hero mode where you play as one of the SoulsBorne protags and just rip through the whole game
[1:04:06] <MelonSouda> Mai Baik
[1:04:08] <AdeptusExterminatus> YE YE YE
[1:04:08] <Demon_chann> ye zombos in this game are quite interesting
[1:04:08] <$Afterman_> @i_chevalier you will be surprised. not in a bad way
[1:04:10] <%BoxNavy> oh no

[1:04:27] <%allups> but all the freakers look so uninspired and samy
[1:04:27] <+Rachet20> My number 1 scenes are any that involve James Allen McCune’s character
[1:04:28] <+Ches_Neckbeard> is Copeland a murderable character at some point?
[1:04:28] <PrinceOfEden> "Dub ya Dub ya"

[1:07:20] <Demon_chann> he sometimes fucking contradict himself
[1:07:20] <%asgard147> It's almost like he a Fuckin' crazy person
[1:07:23] <%JoshManVGH> The goverment puts chemicals in the water to turn the frogs gay.
[1:07:24] <%ssjklyco> Just basic "Mask will sufficate you" babble.

[1:08:23] <%Puhff> ayyy
[1:08:24] <SovPho> @evbites railroads were private until the breakup of Rockefeller investments into oil transportation.
[1:08:25] <Oxybe> whatever works
[1:08:25] <brachydios777> What’s the point of being of being a conspiracy theorist in the zombie post apocalypse?
[1:08:25] <wibbwobbler> How big does big government get
[1:08:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> Use the 22
[1:08:26] <%Puhff> lmao
[1:08:26] <+evbites> Wow
[1:08:27] <$lotharrio> Man, that grenade was way more effective than shooting them six times in the head.
[1:08:28] <Louie_Salmon> Pat used a consumable?
[1:08:28] <friedsquidiot> @MisterAvry they didnt put him in the game because no one was like him
[1:08:29] <%walternatorz> Pat, what's the most freakers you've encountered?
[1:08:29] <%cache_22> I think Pat is still shook by the wolf.
[1:08:31] <+MelodyMedley> NICE
[1:08:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> YE YE YE
[1:08:31] <%RetroCop87> MAI WAIIIIF
[1:08:33] <jorniev> situation handled
[1:08:34] <i_chevalier> @queequegtheater you taking away my God given right to maje my own death camps. jeez this game
[1:08:35] <balthazar758> 💥
[1:08:36] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Wow the grenades are nice in this game
[1:08:36] <$Afterman_> give pat some time
[1:08:37] <+DynDimAcsiwn> that's the first thing about this game that's caught my eye
[1:08:39] <$Afterman_> he will  master it
[1:08:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> So satisfying
[1:08:43] <%Teintstein> nest goo
[1:08:43] <+SocialMisfitGamer> I got the clip but it ain't going through, sorry guys
[1:08:45] <scarman125> It's almost like he's using a controller to aim even though he's on PC but surely not right? who would cripple themselves on purpose like that?
[1:08:46] <Sunstalker> There's something about the combat system that feels like they went back and forth on what it was supposed to be and eventually just went with what they had.
[1:08:46] <$lotharrio> Residue Evil?
[1:08:46] <JittersCaffeine> gross
[1:08:47] <%za7az> Yum, nest residue
[1:08:47] <+trackles_64> nasty residue
[1:08:48] <@SoFarFetched> If you got clips,they're gonna have to be DM'd to a mod or sent to pat on Twitter. Links aren't allowed on here.
[1:08:49] <Dunmarkh> that's just cum
[1:08:50] <scrumbotime> WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THE RESIDUE FROM A NEST
[1:08:50] <Demon_chann> @PatStaresAt have seen how deacon talks to himself like a crazy person
[1:08:52] <+traximus_s> oh right this game heavily advertised there huge hurds
[1:08:54] <Dunmarkh> zombo cum
[1:08:59] <nuane> @brachydios777 you get to brag about how you saw it all coming
[1:08:59] <MarkUriah> @brachydios777 saying you called it the whole time
[1:08:59] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Deacon is like if Tripp from TWD season 3 took a bunch of meth
[1:09:00] <+evbites> @SovPho Yeah so wtf is copeland talking
[1:09:07] <brachydios777> Not that there’s much point of being a conspiracy theorist today
[1:09:07] <+MisterAvry> fuck that, that was a slick grenade move
[1:09:11] <myriad_truth> Pat, you're not bad at all
[1:09:11] <tengel66> You're doing great, Pat.
[1:09:11] <AdeptusExterminatus> They side step which is great!
[1:09:12] <+trackles_64> they swerve to mutch
[1:09:14] <$Afterman_> @PatStaresAt you will get experience with it, dont worry.
[1:09:14] <+Exicuren> It is, yeah
[1:09:16] <%topendbuzza> center mass?
[1:09:18] <jorniev> i think i like it being that hard
[1:09:19] <+Stormzcales_Lair> not titty residue
[1:09:22] <%s1rcuit> guys, no bullshit, this game is harder to aim than in most games
[1:09:29] <BigColossus> have you fighted a horde yet?
[1:09:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt If you're having trouble with aiming, the default sensitivity settings aren't good. Turn it up a little bit
[1:09:31] <KCfusecoast> @stantheman_97 that’s Copeland’s character in general hes part libretarian but hes also borderline anarchist
[1:09:31] <Sunstalker> Is Deacon a Kenny if he never had a kid? kinamaHmm
[1:09:32] <%Riecharus> Yeah they'll juke and jive like no'ones business
[1:09:35] <Profmcstevie> It's hard to hit the tiniest part of the body shockingl
[1:09:36] <+razinmore> freakers are pretty creepy, I think they actually put their hands up to defend their head
[1:09:37] <+MisterAvry> you killed them, you didn't die, good at video games
[1:09:41] <$Afterman_> pat has not seen a horde yet
[1:09:48] <+trackles_64> Chest shots do more dmg than head shots.
[1:09:49] <+Exicuren> Center mas helps, but most of the time, they just take the shot, tjey don't stop
[1:09:51] <%KeiganOfAstora> Hordes are scary
[1:09:52] <myriad_truth> Headshot kills in one, Body shots take like five or seven
[1:09:53] <%DakotaMacDoodle> yeah I like there ai they swerve on ya
[1:09:55] <$Afterman_> roof maybe
[1:09:57] <$Afterman_> if newt
[1:09:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> I got on my bike and got the fuck outta there
[1:09:58] <SovPho> @SovPho I think the idea is that they took the railroads so they could plan decades in advance to build deathcamps? idk, uncle copeland's crazy we only see him on Thanksgiving and Easter
[1:10:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> Then came back and ran them over
[1:10:02] <Demon_chann> weather in this game is fucking nice
[1:10:03] <$Afterman_> newts hang out on roofs
[1:10:06] <%allups> they fucking in the toilets again
[1:10:14] <+trackles_64> need mil spec weapons.
[1:10:14] <%Lion_kun> I assume this is not a game where killing every zombie is viable.
[1:10:14] <AdeptusExterminatus> Get the AK pat
[1:10:22] <JittersCaffeine> gotta make sure the bathroom is safe
[1:10:26] <%QueequegTheater> The zombies obey the rules of gendered bathrooms
[1:10:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Take the rifle over the 22. It's better and your 22 will go back to the locker
[1:10:29] <FutaSnek> @PatStaresAt AK in the bathroom
[1:10:29] <$Afterman_> they dgaf. theyre eating
[1:10:30] <%HollowBeansVG> why does he sound like he cuts himself off, there's no break in his speech
[1:10:36] <friedsquidiot> unfortunately copeland is in the game because thats a pretty common way of thinking in these parts
[1:10:36] <+MisterAvry> occupied!
[1:10:36] <SovPho> rocks only make sound if you can see them duh
[1:10:40] <+GenesisKnight> That animation freaked out
[1:10:42] <%pyurient> ThROUGH HER NECK
[1:10:43] <+DynDimAcsiwn> they got the glory hole in there
[1:10:45] <%s1rcuit> jammed his whole arm through it's neck
[1:10:46] <+HeroSolaire> Anyone else agree that days gone is way more fun than Horizon?
[1:10:47] <$Jetfandam> the rock wasn't effective
[1:10:48] <%topendbuzza> that looked wrong?
[1:10:50] <FutaSnek> Ohhh fair
[1:10:50] <+Exicuren> @sovpho you'll see, Copeland is not that crazy with the railroads
[1:10:52] <%Bailey__gaming> Rag Inventory Full
[1:10:55] <friedsquidiot> like, definitely increased because of apocolypse
[1:11:00] <%allups> @QueequegTheater nah buy the end ur taking out massive hords

[1:11:18] <MelonSouda> @HeroSolaire I haven't played Days gone, but certainly LOOKs more fun than horizon.
[1:11:25] <i_chevalier> @herosolaire only cause it full of crazy
[1:11:26] <%QueequegTheater> As far as Gears of War gray  landscapes go, this one looks pretty good
[1:11:30] <%allups> nice
[1:11:32] <+DynDimAcsiwn> @HeroSolaire from what I'm seeing they are pretty much the same game
[1:11:32] <+Exicuren> @sovpho oh, lmao, sorry

[1:11:40] <+MisterAvry> smooth, tactical, good job

Did u know tht the developers of Disco r communists? knwing that, their depiction of communism seems much more heartbreaking. Explains y its so intimate and biting. As a commie it was really cathartic. Best game ever!
[1:11:52] <FutaSnek> rooH rooH rooH
[1:11:54] <NeroInfinite> so wait.
[1:11:54] <%cache_22> I got here recently. What is Pat's current objective?
[1:11:54] <%Lion_kun> How generous is the game with ammo?
[1:11:56] <%LordCorgi_> wait is this just playstation state of decay
[1:11:57] <%YakumoYomi> "Nest Juice"?
[1:11:58] <SovPho> @Exicuren fuck that mission tho

[1:12:09] <%Teintstein> hell yeah
[1:12:09] <%asgard147> They do
[1:12:10] <thelonechris> That's probably what happens
[1:12:10] <chicken_apostle> open world zombie game with strongholds and a weapon wheel PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:12:11] <myriad_truth> It is poop...
[1:12:12] <+evbites> @pyurient they alive zombies

[1:12:14] <%QueequegTheater> @LordCorgi_ yes
[1:12:15] <%MajorCrasher> if you mean Horizon Zero Dawn, then no. I had infinitely more fun taking down giant robot dinosaurs
[1:12:16] <+bluedude153> Whyyyy did they make a nest?
[1:12:16] <$Jetfandam> poop makes you stronger
[1:12:17] <Demon_chann> yeah
[1:12:17] <%ArcanumArcanum> they literally make a poop nest
[1:12:18] <scrumbotime> doo doo zambinos

[1:12:29] <%allups> yes
[1:12:31] <+democrazyyy> @PatStaresAt have you encountered any hordes yet?
[1:12:32] <%za7az> @bluedude153 They don't like sunlight
[1:12:32] <%AzureGale> LUL
[1:12:33] <LoneFonte> yes
[1:12:34] <SovPho> it's super not what
[1:12:35] <$Afterman_> they comment on the smell in the beginning
[1:12:35] <+Exicuren> be careful, there's a horde around there
[1:12:35] <%QueequegTheater> Can you upgrade bases like in SoD
[1:12:36] <thelonechris> It's Ride to Hell 2
[1:12:36] <chicken_apostle> Looks soooooo generic
[1:12:39] <JittersCaffeine> Poop is a good psychological weapon
[1:12:39] <deviljhojho_> State of play even
[1:12:42] <scrumbotime> State of decay but you get to be one very very crazy man
[1:12:43] <%allups> better but worst is some ways
[1:12:47] <MelonSouda> I lover state of decay. that game was great
[1:12:48] <%allups> in*
[1:12:48] <TheViltsuZ> Generic but FUN
[1:12:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> You don't have the Death Stranding paint anymore?
[1:12:56] <californaya> State of Decay is completely different!
[1:12:58] <+0mega0celot> But this game actually works
[1:12:58] <Aydarkzero> people monkaS
[1:12:58] <+MisterAvry> whom are they?
[1:13:00] <%QueequegTheater> IT'S THE GUBMINT
[1:13:02] <$Afterman_> not good
[1:13:02] <+bluedude153> No no no complete the fema sentence pat
[1:13:02] <SovPho> state of decay but you don't do any state of decay stuff but killing zombies
[1:13:03] <%QueequegTheater> GET EM
[1:13:04] <%Bailey__gaming> do you have binoculars?
[1:13:05] <Dunmarkh> probably bad
[1:13:07] <JittersCaffeine> Can tou mark them?
[1:13:08] <TheViltsuZ> @MelonSouda How's State of Decay 2?
[1:13:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is why you needed the rifle
[1:13:12] <scrumbotime> DEACON WHY ARE YOU TALK
[1:13:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> it has a scope
[1:13:16] <dio96> This looks a little bit better visually than State of Decay.
[1:13:17] <deviljhojho_> mrgrmgrmgrrifters tomatoPunished
[1:13:21] <thelonechris> This protag is a psychopath
[1:13:23] <Aydarkzero> lmao

[1:13:26] <%allups> AHHHH
[1:13:26] <+MisterAvry> damn dude
[1:13:27] <LoneFonte> the horde stuff is what probably the thing that interests me the most
[1:13:28] <alexandrecau> Is deacon a cannibal yet?
[1:13:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is why you need the rifle from Tucker's camp. It has a scope and can be suppressed
[1:13:31] <LunarRemix> Man those people did not do anything to him
[1:13:31] <%Arek_1> Kkonna
[1:13:31] <+bluedude153> How does he know they arent just normal folks?

[1:13:33] <FutaSnek> Awww their spooning :)
[1:13:34] <nuane> they were evil probably
[1:13:36] <scrumbotime> Ok, that kind of just looks like Deacon just murdered two random people for the crime of hunting for their own food
[1:13:38] <Demon_chann> deacon is a psycho btw
[1:13:39] <LunarRemix> He killed two mans in the middle of the wild for nothing
[1:13:40] <+evbites> @alexandrecau ?
[1:13:43] <+Exicuren> Now kill the venison
[1:13:43] <JittersCaffeine> He really reads like a tweaker to me
[1:13:43] <$Afterman_> @alexandrecau he is not a cannibal
[1:13:44] <%Mr_Pylon> hunting in this season? against the law!
[1:13:44] <%cache_22> Was that self-defense or just murder?
[1:13:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> Better rifle
[1:13:46] <%s1rcuit> THEY KILLED MA WAIF
[1:13:47] <SovPho> Anyways, anyone walking around with a full auto weapon in this sort of circumstance is just looking to have literally 0 ammo.
[1:13:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> SPECIAL
[1:13:48] <%Teintstein> evil spooning
[1:13:48] <Qsmash_> those were just two dudes
[1:13:49] <%walternatorz> it's easy to kill anyone when everyone are raiders
[1:13:50] <%QueequegTheater> @dio96 State of Decay is also like 4 years older, in fairness
[1:13:53] <$Jetfandam> I kinda love how simple and videogamey this videogame is
[1:13:56] <LunarRemix> He just murdered two people for NOTHING
[1:13:57] <deviljhojho_> deacon is judge jury and executioner
[1:13:58] <%c00lbeans1999> guilty before proven innocent
[1:13:59] <FutaSnek> AMURICA YEAAAA
[1:14:00] <corn_dad> Beavis and Butthead
[1:14:00] <jorniev> THIS GAME IS SO WEIRD
[1:14:02] <thelonechris> He's no Postal Dude
[1:14:03] <FutaSnek> shoots in the air
[1:14:04] <MelonSouda> @MelonSouda Never actually played state of decay 2 so I can't really give you an answer there I'm afraid.
[1:14:08] <$Afterman_> Deacon just knows how to read people instantly at a glance. thats WHY he has survived
[1:14:10] <%allups> he would kick joels ass
[1:14:13] <+MisterAvry> he was in a biker gang before the zombie apocalypse, sooo
[1:14:14] <Demon_chann> deacon assumes everybody outside of a camp is either a drifter a murder or a rapist
[1:14:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> Is the idea to use the crossbow a lot? It doesn't seem worth it
[1:14:16] <%QueequegTheater> Why?
[1:14:17] <SovPho> It was just more State of Decay.
[1:14:20] <%HollowBeansVG> what about Trevor?
[1:14:21] <reddpop_> freaker is just the worst zombie name yet
[1:14:22] <%skeleklng> I've played it, it's awful
[1:14:23] <JittersCaffeine> @LunarRemix Killed them over a SUSPICION of being raiders
[1:14:24] <Demon_chann> or all tree
[1:14:25] <%allups> yeah not for me
[1:14:28] <$Futurecity10> State of Decay 2 is fucking trash and I loved the first game
[1:14:29] <FutaSnek> @PatStaresAt Got 50 hrs in it, its pretty rough but fun far in
[1:14:29] <+GenesisKnight> Deacon isn't like "crazy but endearing" he's crazy in a way that makes you worry
[1:14:29] <jorniev> jesus pat was so right THIS IS RIDE TO HELL + MONEY
[1:14:29] <%ArcanumArcanum> ive heard bad things about SoD2
[1:14:29] <dio96> Is Deacon hashtag YOUR MC?
[1:14:30] <vonmaultke> Its like Beavis and Butthead survived the apocalypse
[1:14:33] <%topendbuzza> stream jumping around for anyone else?
[1:14:34] <Sunstalker> Dying Light 2 also looking like development hell
[1:14:34] <%Monkeyweed21> it was State of Decay 1 but even worse
[1:14:38] <SovPho> Eh, you know what I will agree. The area is too sparse to have the enjoyment of SoD1
[1:14:39] <%c00lbeans1999> is Freaker the worts zombie name ever
[1:14:40] <%JoshManVGH> What about that other one... not Dead Island....
[1:14:41] <i_chevalier> @misteravry not all biker gangs.
[1:14:41] <%QueequegTheater> Wait, what specifically is bad about it?
[1:14:42] <+kiradusk4200> no way State of Decay 2 is way better than 1 and not a bad zombie game
[1:14:44] <+evbites> @Afterman_ funny thing that sounds like something he would say
[1:14:46] <TheViltsuZ> State of Decay 2 is on Game Pass so I think I'll play it
[1:14:46] <$Afterman_> @KeiganOfAstora trust me, crossbows are BAD for hordes. there will be a large weapon variety and actual reason to use it all.
[1:14:47] <%c00lbeans1999> *worst
[1:14:48] <%allups> u killed people looking for food
[1:14:48] <JustYudha> Huh...I liked it
[1:14:50] <+MisterAvry> deacon would totally take joel golfing
[1:14:50] <%JoshManVGH> The one with the free running?
[1:14:53] <thelonechris> Freddy
[1:14:56] <deviljhojho_> #FreakerGang rise up
[1:14:57] <myriad_truth> How is Freaker any worse than Walker?
[1:14:57] <MelonSouda> First game was great, It's just a shame they couldn't implement the multiplayer
[1:14:59] <$Jetfandam> Deacon is Pat's spirit animal. His Persona...
[1:15:02] <alexandrecau> I mean being good at reading and killing everyone you meet keeps you alive either way
[1:15:03] <%za7az> @JittersCaffeine TRUE American justice HyperTiger
[1:15:04] <%s1rcuit> I remember someone making a game like State of Decay long before it on Newgrounds
[1:15:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> What about Trevor in GTA?
[1:15:10] <%cache_22> @topendbuzza Yes, my stream is jumping like crazy at higher quality settings.
[1:15:11] <%drflatface> did you do the cemetery mission?
[1:15:12] <$Afterman_> @evbites I spent a lot of time in this game world day 1 so I have some knowledge of his character lol
[1:15:12] <%MelBrooksKA> I really wanted SoD2 to be SoD1 but a lot less jank
[1:15:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Afterman_ Oh yea, I know about full auto weapons. That's for hordes. But for taking out small groups... I'd rather just use a suppressed pistol
[1:15:18] <+democrazyyy> damn son, look at that arm
[1:15:21] <FutaSnek> @JoshManVGH Thats Dying Light actually a super good game
[1:15:21] <+democrazyyy> what an arc
[1:15:27] <%LordCorgi_> state of decay 2 is ruined by the blood plague system
[1:15:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> I don't wanna waste skill points to make the crossbow good
[1:15:30] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:15:33] <+trackles_64> game delay
[1:15:37] <$Afterman_> ye, pistols are good, it really just is up to player preference
[1:15:37] <SovPho> i appreciate that sony is invested in arthritis medication but fuck the quick menu sucks
[1:15:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> look out
[1:15:42] <JittersCaffeine> lol did it trigger because you were too far away?
[1:15:43] <thelonechris> Disappointing that they don't run out on fire
[1:15:46] <%c00lbeans1999> JANK JANKJANK JANK!!!
[1:15:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Hang on they're coming
[1:15:52] <TheViltsuZ> @MelonSouda Are you going to play the 2nd Decay at some point?
[1:15:52] <%allups> shot em twitc just hit
[1:15:56] <myriad_truth> Thats why shotgun is better early one
[1:15:58] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> No but muh storylines.
[1:15:58] <deviljhojho_> get freaked on
[1:16:02] <deviljhojho_> or something i dunno
[1:16:04] <$lotharrio> Resident Who-Vil?
[1:16:05] <+fetrigon> got em
[1:16:06] <%s1rcuit> @thelonechris no they do
[1:16:07] <%QueequegTheater> Just use Chris's Karambit knife Kappa
[1:16:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> More! More! More!
[1:16:11] <+MisterAvry> good snap shot on that second to last one
[1:16:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> how's the bike handling in this by the way, bikes tend to be hit or miss in games
[1:16:18] <$Afterman_> rifles bad at close distance who knew
[1:16:18] <+superkeaton> Props to Witwer, he voice acts Crazy very well
[1:16:33] <jorniev> I LIKE THAT
[1:16:34] <%allups> and thats good its not a sleepy game
[1:16:34] <Demon_chann> bike feels good in my opinion
[1:16:35] <%Treuan> Seems like
[1:16:35] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:16:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Bike is okay. It can be upgraded to have btter grip
[1:16:38] <$Afterman_> the powercreep in this game is GOOD pat, so dont worry
[1:16:38] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt They take bullets like RE zombies but move as fast as World War Z zombies
[1:16:39] <deviljhojho_> thats why hordes seem intimidating
[1:16:44] <mr_whet_faartz> really appreciated that about this game'
[1:16:45] <%cache_22> You have to have a backup plan for just about every encounter. It's neat.
[1:16:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> 3
[1:16:47] <%delilah4you> Ever since I learned that games that wanna use hordes always have their zombies be bald because it cuts back on the resources I can never not unsee it
[1:16:47] <+MelodyMedley> Yeah
[1:16:48] <Sunstalker> i kind of think it's a really dumb design choice to have the zombies rush you down all together but then still have them back up and circle you a few feet away so you 1v1 them
[1:16:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> 3 is okay
[1:16:52] <%topendbuzza> seems like it plays ok
[1:16:53] <+evbites> @superkeaton it's just maul without the arrogence
[1:16:55] <%ArcanumArcanum> eventually you can take on more enemies... but then the threats scale up too
[1:16:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @KeiganOfAstora ah, okay thanks
[1:16:59] <$Jetfandam> Shouldn't shotguns be amazing for clearing nests?
[1:17:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> It plays really well
[1:17:05] <chicken_apostle> So it's bad?
[1:17:11] <+MisterAvry> it aint Left 4 Dead thats for sure
[1:17:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea
[1:17:14] <+AbnormalVoid> rub it on your bits for a SEXUAL HIGH
[1:17:16] <%Magewart> Thats piss
[1:17:17] <$Afterman_> @chicken_apostle game is great
[1:17:19] <%QueequegTheater> @chicken_apostle no, that''s a good thing
[1:17:20] <myriad_truth> Yeah shotguns are really good against Freakers
[1:17:21] <MelonSouda> @TheViltsuZ maybe, i'm not against giving it a shot. But it's not high on my list
[1:17:24] <$lotharrio> A JoJo villain!
[1:17:24] <+democrazyyy> man i own this on ps4 but im so tempted to get it on pc now

[1:17:48] <$Afterman_> farm some ears for the shotguns
[1:17:49] <chicken_apostle> like darkness and silence in the niiiiight
[1:17:49] <%c00lbeans1999> god dammit boozer you ass
[1:17:49] <MelonSouda> SNAKE EATERERRRRRR
[1:17:57] <i_chevalier> I wish there was a game where you can play as a zombie, and control your own horde
[1:17:57] <%Magewart> I GIVE MY LIFE

[1:18:00] <%s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt you can steal sawed off from human enemies

[1:18:09] <TheFramedWarlock> Gosh darn freakers

[1:18:34] <+LvckyLvc> #freakergang
[1:18:35] <TheViltsuZ> @zenith0111 The Mad Max game is good...
[1:18:36] <+evbites> Filthy FUCKING FREAKERS
[1:18:37] <$Afterman_> this game has GREAT distance, tbh
[1:18:42] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Mad Max was good tho
[1:18:44] <JittersCaffeine> @KeiganOfAstora I don't think you can store found weapons
[1:18:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> So what?
[1:18:53] <+trackles_64> @topendbuzza  I like climbing towers f u XD
[1:18:53] <%c00lbeans1999> psaUp
[1:19:01] <%pyurient> this game has all the environmental beauty of a fallout 3
[1:19:03] <%cache_22> The question marks are random events. They spawn in and out.
[1:19:06] <$Jetfandam> I feel like this game turns Pat more and more into a zombie killing redneck. Which isn't a bad thing per se...
[1:19:06] <%allups> Mad max was good for a mad max game
[1:19:08] <+evbites> @myriad_truth that game needed a gladiator arena
[1:19:11] <vonmaultke> GOOD, map markers ruin exploration in open worlds
[1:19:13] <SovPho> @KeiganOfAstora Pick up found weapon, run out of ammo, can't find another weapon with same ammo
[1:19:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> I've been using a ground shotgun for awhile now and keep picking up ammo for it. Pistol in other slot and Sniper Rifle in special slot
[1:19:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> You never run out of ammo
[1:19:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> It just isn't an issue, you can but more from the camps for cheap
[1:19:33] <SovPho> Oh yes. Yes you do.
[1:19:34] <jorniev> i wish the Ubisoft tower thing was just anywhere on a high place you can look around, and it shows on your map
[1:19:36] <SovPho> Early game, no.
[1:19:37] <%QueequegTheater> THINK ABOUT WIFE
[1:19:41] <NeroInfinite> Your horse needs fuek
[1:19:41] <$Afterman_> shits poppin off

[1:19:54] <Demon_chann> MA WIFE
[1:19:56] <NeroInfinite> Let the badmans fight the zmbos

[1:20:51] <thelonechris> DEER HOUSE

[1:21:15] <Mattais88> Did that deer just jack-knife?
[1:21:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> He can't tell you now that he's dead

[1:21:48] <$Afterman_> now that deer's son will hunt him down

[1:21:50] <+internetexplorer11> why is pat talking in accent
[1:21:52] <TheViltsuZ> Why do some people come to the chat thinking that the game isn't good?
[1:21:55] <myriad_truth> Yeah get that trust up to buy GUNS
[1:21:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> Shotguns are useful. Use it while you can

[1:22:21] <%Monkeyweed21> why are you talking like you were Paige
[1:22:22] <+thecosmicfly> Argon
[1:22:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> Bikers are from literally anywhere
[1:22:23] <vonmaultke> everything is South if you live in Canada
[1:22:23] <thelonechris> Organ
[1:22:24] <+BIumen> if anything they sound closer to you
[1:22:26] <Vi_Stri> I love Argonians
[1:22:27] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> DAYS Ore-GONE
[1:22:30] <%spitelite> Oregano?
[1:22:31] <AMDBR9S> i've never heard off this mythical land of Ore-e-gon
[1:22:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> There are bikers in New York too dude
[1:22:34] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Thank you, thank you
[1:22:35] <HeroToxiko> Pacific northwest is just California accent but north
[1:22:39] <%ClericOfSparda> It's like how Woolie gave chinese men thick french accents in Yakuza
[1:22:41] <dio96> This game looks way too good visually.
[1:22:42] <%Ynkubus_> Orgone accumulator
[1:22:47] <$dalmek> you gotta keep them equal
[1:22:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> Skill point?
[1:22:57] <circular7> goblins?
[1:23:00] <%allups> no thats not fun to do
[1:23:03] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Did you hear about Biomutant? Apparently is bad
[1:23:05] <ToneBacas> sure
[1:23:07] <+VariousOminousDrones> the menus in this game are so good.
[1:23:11] <%QueequegTheater> MATH
[1:23:12] <circular7> goblins...
[1:23:12] <+trackles_64> gqme is like 15hrs
[1:23:12] <%BoxNavy> the game is 10 focus long
[1:23:14] <%WhereIsWill> HahaThink HahaThink HahaThink
[1:23:14] <%AzureGale> nerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrd
[1:23:15] <MarkUriah> ok
[1:23:17] <+Hyphixsys> BRRRRRmmmmm
[1:23:18] <%Keaton_x> I'm a biker in Wisconsin and can confirm that everyone does indeed suddenly develop a terrible southern accent when they start riding. I believe it's sold alongside your first bike.
[1:23:19] <myriad_truth> Biomutant is bad?
[1:23:22] <PrinceOfEden> Math? In MY video games?! Nah.
[1:23:25] <$Ziegsy> like how most jrpgs  will have you at level 45  at the end?
[1:23:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> Sorta?
[1:23:26] <ToneBacas> but if there aren't as many NERO kits to fill all of those?
[1:23:29] <+Felremi> Stop butchering how you say Oregon
[1:23:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> The game is roughly 50 hours
[1:23:30] <ffkjoao> cmon man, dont make me use my brain. it wasnt built for that
[1:23:37] <Demon_chann> whats funny this is still the baby area
[1:23:40] <Blank9> this is way better than fallout 3 or 4
[1:23:40] <TheViltsuZ> @BliVru It's divisive. I and many others think it's actually good, just unpolished.
[1:23:41] <+Hyphixsys> @myriad_truth watch the SkillUp review, it's pretty bland
[1:23:42] <jorniev> fallout?
[1:23:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> At least 30 hours
[1:23:48] <%Lion_kun> A no5
[1:23:48] <%AncelDeLambert> I demand laser guns, then
[1:23:49] <%za7az> @ToneBacas There are. Pat confirmed it
[1:23:50] <%topendbuzza> tuck
[1:23:50] <thelonechris> Way too colorful to be F3
[1:23:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> Kinda?
[1:23:54] <myriad_truth> No, theres A LOT of Nero kits
[1:23:54] <%DakotaMacDoodle> it the guns feel good
[1:23:56] <NeroInfinite> It's fallout if they gave you a vehical..again
[1:23:56] <%AncelDeLambert> I want plasma rifles that reduce my enemies to piles of goo
[1:23:58] <+democrazyyy> woah look at that body under the bumper
[1:23:59] <ToneBacas> bit of a stretch comparing it to fallout
[1:24:00] <%Lion_kun> A not shitty fallout 3
[1:24:00] <DracaenaLeaf> thought that said talk to truck for a second....
[1:24:02] <Fefe41> This game was way longer than I expected
[1:24:03] <californaya> yeah, I need plasma rifles
[1:24:06] <$lotharrio> Open world post apocalypse in the US is generally gonna feel Fallout-ish.
[1:24:09] <deviljhojho_> just add a green filter
[1:24:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> Gotta be good meds in here
[1:24:13] <Louie_Salmon> Every time that quest pops up in the top left I think it says "fuck"
[1:24:13] <Dunmarkh> nice texture
[1:24:14] <JittersCaffeine> I guess? But it's really just superficial similarities in their post-apocalyptic setting
[1:24:15] <PrinceOfEden> Low Res Ambulance
[1:24:15] <Sunstalker> myriad_truth Just watch streams of it and decide off that.
[1:24:17] <Rr650> But is it a decent game?
[1:24:18] <+GenesisKnight> It's fine, the knife's made of adamatium
[1:24:18] <hamborgini> avert your eyes from the low-res texture!
[1:24:20] <+evbites> @democrazyyy thats a curb stomp fossile
[1:24:20] <deviljhojho_> juke king

[1:24:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> Video games, Pat. Video games.
[1:24:27] <%c00lbeans1999> wonder if pat loves this game or is spite playing it for taxes
[1:24:28] <%AncelDeLambert> how does a zombie know how to juke?
[1:24:29] <zerointelligence000> Is that non-zombie neo?!
[1:24:33] <NeroInfinite> yeah
[1:24:33] <%QueequegTheater> no
[1:24:34] <deviljhojho_> ye
[1:24:34] <+FoolsArcade> He dodge good
[1:24:34] <TheViltsuZ> @Hyphixsys That's his opinion. I've seen people calling it one of the best games this year. You should never latch onto one person's opinion. Also, for SkillUp, a game is either the best thing ever or the worst thing ever.
[1:24:35] <ToneBacas> stand user

[1:24:39] <Mattais88> Why is there no zombie popping out at you randomly from trunks?
[1:24:40] <%QueequegTheater> You imagined that
[1:24:41] <myriad_truth> Freakers are the toughest Zombie
[1:24:42] <+internetexplorer11> no

[1:24:57] <%AncelDeLambert> What does a zombie need with a dodge button?
[1:25:00] <marcdyllan> i saw u miss 3 shots
[1:25:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> You can use a skill point to make aiming better
[1:25:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> Change your sensitivity settings

[1:25:13] <%za7az> @democrazyyy NANI?!
[1:25:20] <+Hyphixsys> @TheViltsuZ I trust his reviews
[1:25:22] <MelonSouda> They're probably not zombies... I'm guessing it's like I am legend where the zombies are intelligent. or whatever
[1:25:23] <RaidenRising> so the mc is a crazy himbo ?
[1:25:24] <BliVru> @AncelDeLambert To dodge, duuh

[1:25:37] <JittersCaffeine> Oh man, I was just reminded of the RLM video about Army of the Dead
[1:25:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yes, the game is good. Stop asking
[1:25:47] <%c00lbeans1999> freakers= tweakers
[1:25:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> If it wasn't good he wouldn't be playing it
[1:25:51] <TheViltsuZ> @Hyphixsys That makes zero sense, why would you ever latch that hard onto a stranger? Seems like stockholm syndrome or something.

[1:45:54] <+BusterRepukken> this is the Bad Ending of the Syphon Filter world
[1:45:55] <ToneBacas> it's too hard to sabotage that bike
[1:45:56] <+HeroSolaire> @BusterRepukken I do too man, wish for remake more than anything
[1:45:56] <%LonePlus_> cant do that mechanic
[1:45:57] <Dunmarkh> sabatoge that corpse's bike
[1:45:58] <%LonePlus_> stupid
[1:46:00] <+Dova573> Cop cars tend to have ammo
[1:46:01] <%NateyBeak> I always hate when a guy can shoot infinity times but if i killed them right away i find 4 bullets. why he no run outta boolet
[1:46:03] <%allups> the owner is probly dead
[1:46:04] <%cache_22> You really need to get the extra ammo skills for mid to late game content.
[1:46:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's ammo in general
[1:46:06] <Sunstalker> This is the Ride to Hell of Far Cr 2's. kinamaBlele
[1:46:15] <%za7az> It does
[1:46:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> You may not
[1:46:19] <+trackles_64> need the deagle
[1:46:21] <andrewofbob> Is it like I Am Alive, where the enemies fired all their ammo before they died, and their corpses have nothing left?
[1:46:24] <ToneBacas> what do you get when you sabotage bikes?
[1:46:25] <jtsoppy137> pistol and shotgun seem like a good combo
[1:46:26] <Hellarussian> just like in the Dead Space
[1:46:26] <+BusterRepukken> How is the port?
[1:46:27] <SaltyAzteca> All the ammo is either here, Oregon Kappa
[1:46:30] <nuane> I feel like comparing this to ride to hell is super unfair
[1:46:30] <+democrazyyy> this gives me the same vibes as dying light where the gameplay hard carries the story
[1:46:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> Useful?

[2:13:27] <BerryliciousDefinition> We're wolves
[2:13:28] <%walternatorz> these wolves have great comedic timing
[2:13:28] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> WOLFIE NO
[2:13:33] <Demon_chann> The pacing is fuck up cuz this game had choices btw
[2:13:33] <NireFuster> Just put that meat in your pocket
[2:13:33] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> oh hey RDR1 mechanics

[2:13:50] <%Paperware> I like the way he said 'meat"
[2:13:50] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> is there a bamham combat counter skill?
[2:13:51] <%jarednotwithsubway> yee

[2:14:04] <SinisterTofu> Just got done listening to the podcast on how that ex-game dev of this game was a crazy asshole lol
[2:14:10] <myriad_truth> That shouldve been the FIRST skill
[2:14:16] <FutaSnek> NANI THE FUCK
[2:14:17] <$lumporr> aim while you runnin
[2:14:18] <ToneBacas> it's confusing, just run and gun
[2:14:18] <scrumbotime> WHAT?
[2:14:19] <SaltyAzteca> This is such a strange game
[2:14:20] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> uhhhh
[2:14:20] <%Magewart> DUMPING POINTS INTO GUNS
[2:14:22] <%jarednotwithsubway> its just improved accuracy while moving
[2:14:23] <%Arek_1> We got... skill skill. psaSmug
[2:14:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea seemed to help me a bt
[2:14:29] <+razinmore> I think its literally just describing running and shooting
[2:14:29] <+Afterman_> while running yea
[2:14:34] <UFOLoche> What a mysterious jogo
[2:14:37] <ralphfromdk> No, it's just really badly worded. It's just better aiming
[2:14:41] <Riorii> i think thats just the shooting tutorial for some strange reason
[2:14:42] <ToneBacas> it's a passive, but the description makes you think it's an active skill
[2:14:45] <+Exicuren> better aim while moving
[2:14:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's just saying when you shoot
[2:14:50] <myriad_truth> Its just better aim while moving
[2:14:51] <%possumwalsh1221> It’s less confusing than it sounds just aim and run lmao
[2:14:57] <+rafaelba93> i never understood that
[2:15:00] <MelonSouda> That is TERRIBLE wording who wrote that?
[2:15:01] <sadcucumber123> janky wording, janky game
[2:15:03] <Louie_Salmon> It's described like the inputs for a special move
[2:15:04] <jorniev> BADFULLY WROTEN
[2:15:05] <NireFuster> It was worded very weirdly yes
[2:15:06] <%MajorCrasher> LUL LUL LUL
[2:15:08] <%jarednotwithsubway> dont be :)
[2:15:08] <%allups> whata mean
[2:15:14] <Astrophizz> they make it sound like shooting improves your accuracy
[2:15:29] <sadcucumber123> use trap on wolf
[2:15:32] <jtsoppy137> more wolves
[2:15:33] <AGRO_91> "Steadies your aim while running" it's not that hard, game
[2:15:33] <NireFuster> "Shoot better while moving" could've been so much easier
[2:15:34] <sadcucumber123> pffty
[2:15:38] <Louie_Salmon> Like "Press this series of buttons to perform the move 'fight and flight's"
[2:15:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> Increase your sensitivity to make aiming a bit easier
[2:15:42] <+MisterAvry> pup snuffers
[2:15:42] <+evbites> @Astrophizz it probably did at some pont
[2:15:44] <%AncelDeLambert> that was a WOLF? It sounded like a dying camel
[2:15:45] <JittersCaffeine> Guns are more effective than traps
[2:15:48] <TheViltsuZ> It's clear you people don't understand what jank even means anymore.
[2:15:49] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> LUL

[2:18:58] <thetunnelhomer> So how "The Last of us" is this game?
[2:18:59] <UFOLoche> Honestly, I'm the same way.  It's more fun to just travel normally most of the time.

[2:19:27] <Dunmarkh> dead body roadblock
[2:19:29] <%allups> why wait in the middle of a dark street
[2:19:29] <JittersCaffeine> That was such a bad ambush
[2:19:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nope

[2:19:43] <eustine> It was just a homeless guy.
[2:19:45] <NireFuster> Absolutely just ran over a homeless guy
[2:19:48] <MelonSouda> At least its a plan. That's more than most of them seem to have
[2:19:48] <%SirGO0SE> i dont think they thought that one through

[2:21:09] <Dunmarkh> yes
[2:21:10] <ralphfromdk> Credits are per camp. You did stuff for Tucker, not coppe
[2:21:10] <srv4254> camp based
[2:21:10] <%cache_22> Credits are per-camp.
[2:21:10] <%Monkeyweed21> credits are per camp iirc
[2:21:13] <jtsoppy137> are credits universal
[2:21:14] <sacout> yup
[2:21:14] <%za7az> Yes to each camp
[2:21:15] <+Cerabret100> If i remember correctly yes they are
[2:21:15] <%jarednotwithsubway> yeah, specific to camps @PatStaresAt
[2:21:16] <ELFucilaNeroIV> ye
[2:21:16] <+ItalianWaifu> do they only use cents what  are credits
[2:21:16] <$lumporr> ehh i guess
[2:21:18] <$lumporr> but still
[2:21:19] <%Dylveryn> each camo has different camp credits
[2:21:19] <Demon_chann> credits are camp based
[2:21:19] <Deasmeister> Per camp credits
[2:21:20] <%DakotaMacDoodle> yeah
[2:21:21] <Profmcstevie> Store credit
[2:21:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea,
[2:21:22] <$lotharrio> There's no world wide credit system.

[2:21:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> Didn't realize that at first
[2:21:25] <myriad_truth> Yeah, they're region specifc
[2:21:27] <BigColossus> yes
[2:21:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's annoying
[2:21:29] <MelonSouda> Camp specific credit makes sense, it's not like the camps talk to each other.
[2:21:33] <%NeoCre> Camp-specific
[2:21:36] <+HefestoForges> wow
[2:21:42] <+Exicuren> Well yeah, they are credits, not money
[2:21:43] <%cache_22> The only real credits are the "ears" to sell.
[2:21:43] <$lumporr> @Victorious_Drago i mean sure

[2:22:34] <+D00msDayDan> the overlaid text on everything reminds me of the diviison
[2:22:35] <%AncelDeLambert> "I saw a really fast bird and I swear it was LOOKING at me! Y'know what that means, right? ALIENS!"
[2:22:36] <+BIumen> for people who hate their now-dead government they sure love showing off their flag

[2:23:34] <Profmcstevie> River fucked it
[2:23:36] <tanarath> WATER NOT GOOD FOR BIKE
[2:23:38] <%cache_22> That dip in the water dealt about 35% damage to the bike.
[2:23:40] <Ipsenscastle> That's not Resi Leon, that's just some shithead from this game

[2:23:55] <%allups> repair it with the guy
[2:23:57] <+FoolsArcade> Pat, it has an engine
[2:23:57] <+Afterman_> bikes live in water
[2:23:58] <%Monkeyweed21> the Redfield BIke
[2:23:59] <$lumporr> water is bad for engine
[2:24:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> Did you clear out Crazy Willy's?
[2:24:00] <jtsoppy137> Kappa
[2:24:01] <%Tman451> water is horrible for engines
[2:24:02] <+HefestoForges> pat cmon
[2:24:04] <+FoolsArcade> of course water is bad, you dont wanna flood the engine
[2:24:04] <erogenousjones> water is real good for a running engine
[2:24:05] <mr_saturday93> pat you moron
[2:24:05] <MelonSouda> Bike does not swim well
[2:24:06] <$dalmek> but what if it's thirsty?
[2:24:07] <+trackles_64> water makes it catch fire
[2:24:08] <NireFuster> There's a difference between putting water IN a bike and putting the bike IN water
[2:24:08] <$lumporr> water in engine is fucky wucky
[2:24:09] <Hellarussian> no, bikes need water to keep them from getting thirsty
[2:24:09] <%cache_22> Water-cooled bike. You know, for overclocking.
[2:24:12] <Astrophizz> carburetors hate it
[2:24:13] <tanarath> Water in engine bad
[2:24:14] <DianaTheAscian> Pat
[2:24:15] <%twistedj3ster> engines have water pumps, this is true
[2:24:15] <%DukeMoose> No youre supposed to pour gasoline on it not water
[2:24:16] <morningmoondude> pat try breathing water to see how the bike felt
[2:24:18] <JittersCaffeine> So, my prediction is that these people are actually being kept inside a fenced in area and they don't know it yet because the government is containing the zombies
[2:24:19] <venny_doe> stfu cars are impossible
[2:24:21] <Sunstalker> Bike go land, not go water. Water bad
[2:24:22] <NeroInfinite> Pat please
[2:24:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> Water good just in certain places
[2:24:25] <ToneBacas> Pat, they take out the balls. Elmo has no balls
[2:24:25] <Hellarussian> bikes need to drink water too
[2:24:28] <Fefe41> Bikes are like rats, they can't swim
[2:24:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> Natural combustion
[2:24:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> lol
[2:24:30] <mr_saturday93> it's common sense pat....
[2:24:30] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> basic mechanics ?
[2:24:30] <%BoxNavy> pat doesnt know anything
[2:24:31] <alexandrecau> Engine is like rats they can'T swim pat
[2:24:32] <sadcucumber123> bruh
[2:24:35] <%cache_22> How do engine go vroom?
[2:24:39] <NeroInfinite> Mechanics is the same as tech
[2:24:40] <%Monkeyweed21> how is the gasoline supposed to burn if the engine is flooded @PatStaresAt
[2:24:41] <+MisterAvry> lesson 1, they don't do great in water generally
[2:24:46] <%AzureGale> Technologyyyyyyyyyyyyyy scattered on the ground
[2:24:46] <balthazar758> 🚗
[2:24:47] <morningmoondude> Engine is like rats they can'T swim pat
[2:24:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Naturally Aspirated Combustion Engine? What's that?
[2:24:48] <DianaTheAscian> Pat probably thinks Woolie is real
[2:24:48] <%dewy_516> can u even fall off the bike?
[2:24:54] <%twistedj3ster> suck squeeze bang blow
[2:24:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> Engine go brrr/
[2:24:54] <tanarath> rats can totes swim, though
[2:24:55] <dinnydanny777> Don't forget to both feed and water your bike regularly to ensure it stays healthy
[2:25:00] <Louie_Salmon> Yep it just spins
[2:25:00] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> I am excited for the day that you chronicle a DIY home reno
[2:25:02] <%hrbeck_> engines are a bunch of holes, to run it needs those holes to NOT be full of water
[2:25:02] <%baka_sugoi> bike go burrrrr
[2:25:02] <%Riggs_The_Roadie> Cooldown like Motorstorm
[2:25:04] <erogenousjones> water is great for combustion I heard
[2:25:05] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> but water + tech = bad
[2:25:05] <MelonSouda> Engine eat dinosaur juice to go vroom
[2:25:08] <myriad_truth> You can easily fall off the bike
[2:25:09] <+Victorious_Drago> Pat who is the better driver you or Woolie?
[2:25:09] <+D00msDayDan> just add gasoline!
[2:25:10] <BigColossus> Pat is notorious for not knowing stuff
[2:25:11] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> LUL
[2:25:11] <+HefestoForges> you gotta take your bike to the vet too
[2:25:14] <+vicar_anat> Pat has no points in mechanics on his character sheet

[2:25:15] <%dewy_516> no pat KNOWS woolie is real
[2:25:18] <dinnydanny777> Also don't forget to make sure your bike gets lots and lots of sunlight so that it grows real big and strong
[2:25:21] <TheGreatRedDragon_> some german magic

[2:35:42] <Sunstalker> with the rocks?
[2:35:42] <+Exicuren> Using the attractors
[2:35:43] <+D00msDayDan> PRO STRATS
[2:35:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why?
[2:35:44] <%allups> u just did it with the radio

[2:35:45] <myriad_truth> Like what you just did
[2:35:46] <feralspidey> Oh, no, their... not eating him, just running around like chickens
[2:35:46] <%NateyBeak> i thnk you had it with that first toss
[2:35:46] <+Cerabret100> I mean it looked like that first distractor was doing it
[2:35:47] <+trackles_64> throw the noise into camp
[2:35:47] <+MayorRev> 4Head just do it
[2:35:47] <+Afterman_> how do rat swim

[2:35:49] <Fefe41> You just did before you jumped off
[2:35:52] <Deasmeister> you di just before
[2:35:53] <Profmcstevie> Aggro them silly, shoot a few
[2:35:55] <eustine> That first attractor seemed to work.
[2:35:55] <Magicalquack> you just did it
[2:35:55] <Demon_chann> attract0rs
[2:35:56] <%Garthunox> just shoot a bullet
[2:35:57] <+Exicuren> or using the guns
[2:35:57] <+MisterAvry> small range?
[2:35:57] <+D00msDayDan> i think you do it by jumping right into them
[2:35:57] <Dunmarkh> throw one into the camp
[2:35:58] <Riorii> make them fire at you
[2:36:00] <myriad_truth> Just get them to start shooting at you
[2:36:01] <%Garthunox> un suppressed
[2:36:02] <%Arek_1> @Afterman_ LUL
[2:36:02] <sadcucumber123> Run to them and lead them in the camp then
[2:36:03] <RetributionP> you do what you just did at the camp
[2:36:04] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Make an explosion go off or something?
[2:36:04] <%cache_22> If you go closer to the cave entrance and just shoot in the air that should do it.
[2:36:05] <%possumwalsh1221> I mean the first one worked
[2:36:06] <%allups> clear some then use the sound thingy
[2:36:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> Shoot one, lead them towards camp
[2:36:10] <BigColossus> lets make some noice
[2:36:12] <TheGreatRedDragon_> monkaS
[2:36:13] <$lumporr> yeah i figured you were just gonna run towards the gunmen with your zombie cavalry behind you
[2:36:15] <+Afterman_> NO
[2:36:17] <zerointelligence000> you did it with the first bu the second threw them off
[2:36:17] <MelonSouda> it looked like you had it with the first attractor, then the second one drew them away
[2:36:20] <+MisterAvry> why
[2:36:21] <%NeoCre> Attractors can be built
[2:36:23] <+Afterman_> just throw at camp
[2:36:25] <+Afterman_> SOUND GO FAR
[2:36:25] <%Garthunox> no
[2:36:28] <venny_doe> pat. just throw it into camp. if it runs out, do it again
[2:36:30] <%NeoCre> First attractor had them
[2:36:34] <NireFuster> Good job Pat!
[2:36:37] <RetributionP> throw it ontop of the bridge
[2:36:38] <%Garthunox> just throw one over to the camp
[2:36:40] <+HefestoForges> you didn't need 2
[2:36:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> And then they meet up
[2:36:46] <%allups> i tihnk it wouldve worked either way
[2:36:46] <+Fooguwu> wasted 1
[2:36:47] <Ipsenscastle> just throw one into the camp, it worked first time
[2:36:47] <+Cerabret100> thatsd not a lot of zombies though, they probably won't clear it
[2:36:48] <%possumwalsh1221> And awaaaaay they go
[2:36:51] <xeros720> wait, it got one of em
[2:36:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> That should do it?
[2:36:56] <+MisterAvry> yeah just one would do it I'm sure
[2:37:01] <%Monkeyweed21> PAT NO IT WAS WORKING
[2:37:03] <+Exicuren> And that's how you let freakers do you job
[2:37:05] <+razinmore> thats pretty cool I didn't even think to do this
[2:37:05] <%CalderGaming> psaGoblin
[2:37:07] <Demon_chann> one should do it
[2:37:10] <%dewy_516> wait so there dialogue after every kill??
[2:37:14] <myriad_truth> WOuld you rather fight People or Freakers?
[2:37:16] <%dewy_516> this game is wild
[2:37:18] <+HefestoForges> ohhhh
[2:37:18] <%Riecharus> They might get bored on the way to the attractor unless someone starts shooting at them
[2:37:19] <%Reveresao> hes learning people chill
[2:37:21] <NireFuster> How does that guy not see you? LUL
[2:37:25] <venny_doe> If you kill rapists and murders in a video game, its fine. You did it in real life, you need to leave the ubisoft hq >:L

[2:38:08] <+MayorRev> Who's footprints are these?
[2:38:08] <%AncelDeLambert> ... Deacon that's not quite how clearing bandits out works
[2:38:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh so this time they're not rapists too?
[2:38:16] <+D00msDayDan> what was that noise?
[2:38:16] <dinnydanny777> He's so into murder
[2:38:23] <%AncelDeLambert> in fact, you can just HURT bandits enough, and they'll fuck off anywhere else
[2:38:23] <Hellarussian> sure is
[2:38:25] <ralphfromdk> No.
[2:38:29] <eustine> run
[2:38:29] <Dunmarkh> you got shot

[2:38:35] <JittersCaffeine> don't forger about the traps
[2:38:37] <%AncelDeLambert> cuz it's super hard to engage in banditry without an eye and working legs
[2:38:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> no
[2:38:42] <%HollowBeansVG> he's always yelling
[2:38:42] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Because jes crazy
[2:38:43] <+MisterAvry> because he loves murder so much
[2:38:43] <Dunmarkh> bullets inside you
[2:38:46] <ELFucilaNeroIV> I am turok
[2:38:48] <+Victorious_Drago> Deacon is yelling because he has a massive erection right now and he's deeply confused
[2:38:53] <erogenousjones> he's just doing his best conan the barbarian impression
[2:38:56] <+Qexec> Oregonian Rage

[2:39:32] <%allups> ones in the bear trap
[2:39:34] <$lumporr> just have the other guy shoot at you
[2:39:42] <dinnydanny777> You know the Simpsons episode with the tall man in the small car? Deacon sounds like that guy
[2:39:46] <NireFuster> There we go
[2:39:47] <%AncelDeLambert> Deacon officially lives in a fantasy world where he has built himself up to being some kind of a hero just to mentally deal with his own kill-count
[2:39:53] <+Afterman_> all they care about is noise
[2:39:54] <+Afterman_> not human
[2:39:55] <JittersCaffeine> You might want to leave
[2:39:56] <jtsoppy137> but what now
[2:39:57] <%HollowBeansVG> this looks wonky as hell, still kind of cool though
[2:39:57] <Laecerelius> that's a lotta zombos
[2:39:58] <%dewy_516> that dude didn't even care
[2:40:03] <NireFuster> Are they coming to YOU?

[2:40:15] <+MayorRev> Sooooooo are his friends not gonna help?
[2:40:15] <諏訪子> That NPC just getting ragdolled
[2:40:16] <eustine> Theres a gas can up  there

[2:40:16] <Profmcstevie> Bandit flesh! Bandit flesh! FRESH MEAT!
[2:40:18] <%cache_22> What if you get the raiders to shoot at you to make the sounds attract to them?
[2:40:20] <+trackles_64> mini swarm

[2:41:52] <$lumporr> the first distractor thrown from across the cliff was good
[2:41:53] <%Monkeyweed21> you could have just run into the camp
[2:41:53] <jtsoppy137> FRAG OUT
[2:41:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> Used up a lot of ammo
[2:42:01] <$lumporr> the guy just stomped it before you could shoot him
[2:42:04] <Profmcstevie> Reminds me of being able to just fight a horde of zombies in Last Of Us part 2, you just fight the horde LUL

[2:42:52] <SaltyAzteca> Things went better than expected?
[2:42:54] <+Fooguwu> USE EVERY RESOURCE PogChamp
[2:42:56] <balthazar758> all according to plano
[2:42:57] <%HunguyTV> HunguyTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! 
[2:42:57] <%cache_22> Oh, I think the beartraps slowed the freakers down going up the hill so they never went further.
[2:43:01] <+trackles_64> weren't they already dead being zombies?
[2:43:03] <%Monkeyweed21> you could have just run into the camp
[2:43:09] <NireFuster> Could you have done this whole thing sneakily?
[2:43:13] <sadcucumber123> ^
[2:43:14] <%Riecharus> USually the mauraders shoot at the freaks and that starts a chain reaction that kills everyone

[2:49:08] <Sunstalker> Yeah that's real bad
[2:49:09] <%shurtal> good AMERICAN steel
[2:49:09] <Hellarussian> its like opening a can of tuna its fine
[2:49:09] <MelonSouda> Bunker busting Knoife
[2:49:10] <xcompleasedad> The worst bunker ever
[2:49:10] <Demon_chann> guys i kinda like copeland hes so unhinged is funny
[2:49:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> Elmo so smart
[2:49:11] <$lumporr> your knife would snap
[2:49:12] <%allups> now why coudnt u just sneak in there when everyone was alive
[2:49:12] <%Puhff> say babba booey
[2:49:13] <minty_con> kitty
[2:49:15] <JittersCaffeine> Yeah, this is a pretty ham fisted caricature. But there's irony and parody are dead. it's like when you see people legitimately looking up to characters like Rorschach.
[2:49:16] <erogenousjones> he was cutting the tape holding it closed Pat
[2:49:17] <+S7UBBS> It's not locked its just to lift it
[2:49:20] <NeroInfinite> It's a crowbar knife
[2:49:20] <Laecerelius> Knife of Lockpicking +30
[2:49:21] <%Monkeyweed21> This game feels like it was made by a bunch of people that grew up in rural Oregon and FUCKING HATED IT
[2:49:24] <+trackles_64> its a dull knife
[2:49:27] <DianaTheAscian> how did they build this?
[2:49:31] <jorniev> WHA- WITH A KNIFE!? i just looked a way did he seriously do that!?
[2:49:36] <+MayorRev> This writing is kinda goofy
[2:49:42] <$lumporr> @Monkeyweed21 or loved it
[2:49:48] <%Puhff> hehe cock
[2:49:49] <dan_g_v> party bunker
[2:49:49] <+trackles_64> drugs
[2:49:50] <tanarath> @jorniev yep
[2:49:51] <ApexJaggi> Stamina cocktail? Viagra?
[2:49:52] <%za7az> Yeah, get that cock!
[2:49:54] <%Magewart> Hes unlocked meth
[2:49:55] <NeroInfinite> It a drink for stamina
[2:49:57] <Laecerelius> Learned how to craft Staminans
[2:49:57] <%Riecharus> Stamina Cocktails are clutch since stamina is basically health in this game
[2:49:57] <MelonSouda> stamina potion
[2:49:59] <諏訪子> A cocktail of stamina
[2:50:01] <$Ziegsy> hehe, tail.
[2:50:02] <%s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt it's in your best interest to clear all the camps because they give you more craft recipes
[2:50:05] <NeroInfinite> sleep on couch
[2:50:07] <Hellarussian> and why is it
[2:50:07] <%jarednotwithsubway> it helps regen, in medical
[2:50:08] <erogenousjones> stamina cocktail is like a molotov, but it explodes with stamina
[2:50:09] <dinnydanny777> Stamina cocktail? 😳
[2:50:10] <SomeAsianDood> Cocaine PogChamp
[2:50:11] <%s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt meds tab
[2:50:11] <xcompleasedad> Amphetamines?
[2:50:12] <myriad_truth> In da medicine
[2:50:13] <%allups> nah
[2:50:13] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> psaBlind psaBlind
[2:50:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @DianaTheAscian it seems that you're using thoughts and logic, we don't do that here
[2:50:15] <+trackles_64> health
[2:50:17] <Fefe41> It's stamina juice
[2:50:23] <Demon_chann> its viagra
[2:50:23] <%Puhff> no cocktail for thee until you answer riddles 3
[2:50:24] <RetributionP> blind
[2:50:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Instantly refills stamina. So you can run away, refill it and keep running. To create distance
[2:50:28] <ralphfromdk> It's passive boosts to healing and stamina regen
[2:50:30] <xcompleasedad> Moonshine with a berry flavor? LUL
[2:50:31] <$lumporr> it's a whiskey sour
[2:50:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> Health items obviously
[2:50:35] <+Victorious_Drago> Sterilizer?  Are you drinking bleach?!
[2:50:42] <%AncelDeLambert> here? In the bandit camp?
[2:50:43] <Sunstalker> I don't think ther's any fucking steriliser you should be drinking
[2:50:43] <+trackles_64> u can save in beds
[2:50:44] <SomeAsianDood> "berries"
[2:50:46] <myriad_truth> You want to be here at NIGHT!!
[2:50:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's for running away more
[2:50:47] <$Ziegsy> @dianatheascian this is a naturally occuring Oregon bunker. they are in season now
[2:50:48] <%shurtal> man Starkiller, why you so crazy
[2:50:51] <+MayorRev> so is this open world?
[2:50:53] <%Quigsies> #FreakerGang
[2:50:53] <BigColossus> whateva
[2:50:58] <xcompleasedad> @Victorious_Drago I'm assuming grain alcohol
[2:51:03] <Hellarussian> what if
[2:51:04] <DianaTheAscian> k
[2:51:05] <SomeAsianDood> Ethanol is a sterilizer, u can drink that if diluted
[2:51:06] <jtsoppy137> its probly not Kappa
[2:51:07] <+Vigonept> you can drink bleached water
[2:51:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> @MayorRev Kinda
[2:51:09] <Profmcstevie> spelunking time
[2:51:10] <Dunmarkh> seems legit
[2:51:12] <SomeAsianDood> Probably won't be super fun
[2:51:13] <Sunstalker> Partycave kinamaPog
[2:51:13] <$dalmek> #FreakerGang
[2:51:13] <$lumporr> do they not respawn when you sleep
[2:51:14] <+mgskomododragon> did he check the gun locker?
[2:51:15] <%Dylveryn> It's probably empty
[2:51:17] <$lotharrio> Possi-bly
[2:51:19] <NireFuster> what if
[2:51:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's still full of their poo smears
[2:51:21] <myriad_truth> Pat's got balls of steel
[2:51:23] <+trackles_64> ladders are hard
[2:51:24] <+MayorRev> ohhhh
[2:51:25] <DianaTheAscian> what if theirs more
[2:51:30] <NeroInfinite> there was a gun locker
[2:51:31] <%s1rcuit> psaGib
[2:51:39] <myriad_truth> Hordes are HARD
[2:51:40] <%za7az> Yes, it's a difficult one
[2:51:43] <+trackles_64> nope
[2:51:43] <jtsoppy137> nah your crazy
[2:51:44] <+S7UBBS> Gun lockers are only for your stuff
[2:51:44] <xcompleasedad> With the ladder?
[2:51:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> Multiple medium sized open worlds, there's a few of them. He's still in the first
[2:51:48] <jorniev> THAT looked like fun
[2:51:50] <+tigerstyle96> Does Pat like this game?
[2:51:52] <%shadowace2400> DA BABY
[2:51:54] <Profmcstevie> You aren't really equipped for this shit
[2:51:55] <sadcucumber123> empty :(
[2:51:56] <Profmcstevie> least not yet
[2:51:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yup
[2:52:00] <JittersCaffeine> gun lockers are just stashes
[2:52:01] <ralphfromdk> No, one or 2 molotovs and that horde would be dead real fast.
[2:52:01] <MelonSouda> some bony boys!
[2:52:01] <erogenousjones> freaker closet
[2:52:02] <%s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt you can get ammo at the locker
[2:52:02] <+MayorRev> classic monster closet
[2:52:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> Game gets tougher now
[2:52:05] <+Afterman_> there are caves later
[2:52:05] <xcompleasedad> They were just hiding in the cave LUL
[2:52:09] <$lotharrio> Well why would they stockpile supplies?
[2:52:09] <$Ziegsy> @reallybigrocks Maybe because im half asleep but I just laughed really hard. thank you
[2:52:09] <TheViltsuZ> @tigerstyle96 Yes
[2:52:11] <+S7UBBS> There are some massive hordes and caves in this game in some areas
[2:52:16] <NeroInfinite> ah
[2:52:18] <Sunstalker> tigerstyle96 It has merit. Like a skyrims
[2:52:18] <dan_g_v> magic cave
[2:52:22] <%Puhff> it makes sense that combat would be difficult since Deacon isn't a soldier or anything; he's just a dude who can fight kinda
[2:52:24] <%Dylveryn> When you find horde caves there's more inside
[2:52:26] <jorniev> do gun lockers not unlock guns?
[2:52:26] <krewl123> elmo butt scooting into pats arms
[2:52:32] <+Afterman_> ye
[2:52:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Ziegsy Happy to help
[2:52:36] <ralphfromdk> Honestly, You should mainline the story for a bit to unlock more of the good stuff
[2:52:37] <%AzureGale> Does every locker have a 3D printer or something
[2:52:38] <jtsoppy137> BORK BOPPER
[2:52:40] <+MayorRev> awoooooo
[2:52:41] <sadcucumber123> OwO
[2:52:42] <$lotharrio> DOG!
[2:52:43] <+trackles_64> kinda opens up
[2:52:49] <+S7UBBS> The map is pretty massive
[2:52:51] <Demon_chann> deacon is a soldier @Puhff
[2:52:52] <+Vigonept> does it not let you explore beyond the story areas?
[2:52:53] <%s1rcuit> IT'S THOSE FED WOLVES
[2:52:54] <Astrophizz> bork bork
[2:52:59] <%Puhff> jfc there are SO MANY wolves
[2:53:00] <$Ziegsy> SPEAKING OF. hows the boy?
[2:53:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> have you met FREAKER BEAR yet?
[2:53:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dude this map is huge and you have many options. What are you talking about?
[2:53:06] <%Dylveryn> @jorniev you buy guns at camps, gun lockers just let you change out guns
[2:53:06] <%Riecharus> Yeah if you stick to the story for a bit it opens up
[2:53:07] <%Puhff> @Demon_chann oh fuck
[2:53:10] <+fetrigon> what
[2:53:11] <quantumteej> The map he's already unlocked is fairly large
[2:53:12] <%jarednotwithsubway> @PatStaresAt once you get saddlebags, its almost always cheaper to run your guns dry and refill from saddle, saddlebag ammo is always a flat $400
[2:53:16] <xcompleasedad> his arm should be GONE by now
[2:53:18] <JetpackMcQuack> flop
[2:53:18] <%s1rcuit> @ReallyBigRocks that's way later
[2:53:19] <%Puhff> LUL
[2:53:19] <Hellarussian> sick quip
[2:53:20] <%AncelDeLambert> if this were anything other than a video game, Deacon's arm would be USELESS without a good surgeon and a month to heal
[2:53:22] <%HollowBeansVG> nice! shot that dog in the face!
[2:53:22] <dinnydanny777> Jesus Deacon
[2:53:23] <Astrophizz> lmao
[2:53:23] <jtsoppy137> blew that damn dogs brains out
[2:53:24] <+MayorRev> he's proud
[2:53:25] <sadcucumber123> he congratulates himself LUL
[2:53:26] <DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:53:27] <%cache_22> Deacon has gamer brain.
[2:53:27] <ELFucilaNeroIV> gamer quip
[2:53:30] <$lotharrio> GOBBO!
[2:53:34] <dinnydanny777> He's so happy to have shot a dog in the head
[2:53:34] <$lumporr> wtf?????
[2:53:37] <+MisterAvry> @xcompleasedad DAYS gone!
[2:53:38] <balthazar758> freako
[2:53:39] <$lumporr> is that a l4d witch?
[2:53:39] <%MechArch> he's like york
[2:53:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> THOSE LEGS
[2:53:43] <robotman37> What was the wolf made out of
[2:53:45] <Demon_chann> @Puhff i think it metion he was in iraq or something
[2:53:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> The front legs going stiff looks great
[2:53:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> @s1rcuit dissapointing, are there other freaker animals?
[2:53:47] <+Victorious_Drago> Every zombie in this game looks like gollum
[2:53:57] <%HollowBeansVG> why do they hear you throwing it every time!?!?!
[2:53:58] <%cache_22> What would Deacon's gamertag be?
[2:53:59] <%AncelDeLambert> no, seriously, why would a zombie dodge?
[2:54:03] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[2:54:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> The more noise it makes the more it attracts
[2:54:07] <%s1rcuit> @ReallyBigRocks at least one other yes
[2:54:09] <%Puhff> god im so sick of these jukin zombies
[2:54:09] <%shadowace2400> I love the perk that makes it so that you can throw a rock into their heads
[2:54:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> I want a full RDR2 compendium of freaker critters
[2:54:15] <quantumteej> Not zombos
[2:54:15] <no123450n> rude
[2:54:16] <myriad_truth> Cause they're not zombies
[2:54:17] <%jarednotwithsubway> LUL
[2:54:17] <+trackles_64> lul
[2:54:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> And now there's another one
[2:54:20] <KasiCrafter> I love how zombies are the one immune to the BS stealth tactic of "What was that noise?"
[2:54:20] <%Puhff> you can't just dodge bullets like that
[2:54:21] <+MayorRev> deacon feels like a psychopath imo
[2:54:22] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> One of these times, Copeland is going to pop on and be like "Welcome to Radio Free Oregon, and now, a word from our sponsor.", and it's just Joe Rogan going "Yeah Freakers are nuts, but have you ever tried DMT?"
[2:54:25] <@CreepyPorpoise> tweakers u_u
[2:54:25] <+Afterman_> actually yes
[2:54:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> Freakers
[2:54:26] <$lotharrio> Do not mislabel them.
[2:54:26] <%allups> duh
[2:54:27] <alexandrecau> zombies swim to not drown
[2:54:27] <Dunmarkh> FREAKER GANG RISE UP
[2:54:28] <balthazar758> freakozoids
[2:54:30] <@CreepyPorpoise> the true oregon experience
[2:54:31] <NeonBleu> they still hurt Kappa
[2:54:31] <%AncelDeLambert> oh of course, silly me
[2:54:32] <%KineticZen> Yeah, urmum
[2:54:33] <Sunstalker> We've seen a bear, so expect zombie bear i guess
[2:54:35] <Demon_chann> their not zombies
[2:54:40] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[2:54:41] <+MayorRev> freddy freaker
[2:54:42] <ralphfromdk> well... they aren't dead, they are infected 28 days later style
[2:54:43] <+Vigonept> aint even seen a freaker
[2:54:44] <dio96> #FREAKERGANG
[2:54:44] <+MisterAvry> they're not undead, they're just on meth
[2:54:45] <+MayorRev> dancing new sensation
[2:54:46] <Demon_chann> the whole not zombies make more sense later
[2:54:46] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt hey Pat, can rats swim?
[2:54:47] <+MisterAvry> it's Oregon
[2:54:47] <%DakotaMacDoodle> There alive just super feral
[2:54:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> Damn Freako's
[2:54:52] <$dalmek> #FreakerGang by the way
[2:54:52] <%MechArch> what the freak
[2:54:59] <+Taisuru> Taisuru subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[2:55:00] <Astrophizz> I want a freak in the morning A freak in the evening, just like me
[2:55:04] <myriad_truth> He hasn't seen a bear yet
[2:55:05] <erogenousjones> @NoHoldsBarredProductions they're called freakers cos they've freaked out after too much DMT
[2:55:05] <SomeAsianDood> Yeah they aren't zombies. They're just florida men
[2:55:09] <%Solid_Stro> Have you ever been in a Turkish prison? psaBougie
[2:55:22] <KasiCrafter> Way to ride the LOUDEST mode of transport possible
[2:55:26] <+MisterAvry> certified freaks, seven days a week
[2:55:29] <tengel66> excited for the youtubes transfer so i can like and watch again :)
[2:55:31] <LunarRemix> So good?
[2:55:34] <+trackles_64> facts
[2:55:34] <%jarednotwithsubway> fair enough
[2:55:36] <ralphfromdk> That's.... not a bad way to put it actually
[2:55:38] <+S7UBBS> Its a flawed game of a game
[2:55:40] <jtsoppy137> i guess?
[2:55:42] <Demon_chann> so good
[2:55:43] <ELFucilaNeroIV> So the red dead zombie dlc?
[2:55:43] <%shadowace2400> I mean... pretty much?
[2:55:44] <+Afterman_> @KasiCrafter best kind of transport here tho
[2:55:45] <%allups> and worst writing and characters
[2:55:47] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> @erogenousjones So Joe Rogan caused all of this
[2:55:49] <$lumporr> has it been mentioned how on the nose the government zombie response force being called NERO is
[2:55:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> They're called freakers because they're just freakin and vibin just like everyones favorite basketball player
[2:55:51] <%jarednotwithsubway> jump ROAD
[2:55:52] <+Victorious_Drago> the dialogue seems way worse
[2:55:53] <%possumwalsh1221> I mean yea kinda
[2:55:55] <godzookylives> @PatStaresAt you ever play Undead Nightmare?
[2:55:56] <Deasmeister> Less likeable cast though
[2:55:58] <Astrophizz> jump it
[2:56:01] <%Puhff> sure have come a long way since pacman
[2:56:04] <awfully_crispy> I'd definitely play this again over a second run of RDR2
[2:56:05] <ralphfromdk> Now if we could just get both in one game. Good story and cutscenes + better gameplay not made by rockstar, it would be ace
[2:56:05] <+Afterman_> but sam witwer makes it work
[2:56:13] <Explodincatz> but no horse balls
[2:56:13] <balthazar758> seems like a decent game, in need of some polish
[2:56:17] <+D00msDayDan> Now I’m imagining deacon whistling and his bike just drives up to him on its own
[2:56:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> Good music
[2:56:19] <erogenousjones> @NoHoldsBarredProductions Joe Rogan has caused a lot of problems
[2:56:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Bass line
[2:56:20] <%Solid_Stro> I miss Author sabert14Sip
[2:56:20] <jtsoppy137> stink zone
[2:56:23] <myriad_truth> Freaker town
[2:56:23] <%Dylveryn> @allups Don't diss Deacon like that he's the absolute best this game has to offer
[2:56:24] <%Riecharus> Freaker city
[2:56:26] <+Fooguwu> hhoooooooo
[2:56:30] <dinnydanny777> Fight them all at once, easy
[2:56:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> The motorcycles balls shrink when it's cold out
[2:56:36] <$lotharrio> 5?! That's some NESTY shit. Kappa
[2:56:37] <+Dova573> Nice new MHR update is out
[2:56:37] <sadcucumber123> in the window, pat
[2:56:41] <sadcucumber123> throw in the window
[2:56:42] <+MisterAvry> he sounds like he's eating spicy wings when he does that
[2:56:44] <%Puhff> why do nests stink? is it cuz of poop?
[2:56:44] <%Taisuru> Freakland
[2:56:46] <ralphfromdk> Window with the branches in it, just toss a molotov in there
[2:56:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> And you only get 3 molotovs. How are you gonna do that?
[2:56:49] <TheViltsuZ> @balthazar758 What would you polish?
[2:56:55] <lowlaffles258> I like the writing, seems accurate to some people I've heard about
[2:56:58] <%Arek_1> @ReallyBigRocks LUL
[2:57:06] <Demon_chann> @Puhff poop and sticks
[2:57:08] <%Dylveryn> You make more

[2:57:17] <+Afterman_> pat said fuck off and die
[2:57:20] <%allups> @Dylveryn Well besides driving ur absolutely right LUL
[2:57:20] <sadcucumber123> pat beats women on stream LUL
[2:57:24] <+Afterman_> someone screaming
[2:57:24] <+jinz3898> did that zombie clipped through the wall?
[2:57:26] <%MisterTylerrr> Man..playing MonHun with Rando's is...woof
[2:57:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> What if there isn't the right stuff to craft more?
[2:57:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> I've been there
[2:57:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> More ferakers
[2:57:55] <deviljhojho_> days gone more like

[2:58:16] <BigColossus> there is always a chain reaction
[2:58:16] <+MisterAvry> got em
[2:58:20] <%thotbane> damn this game looks much improved since Shy played it
[2:58:22] <balthazar758> @theviltsuz the cutscenes, the pacing. remove those weird cuts and fade outs. rewrite some dialogue. gameplay seems fine.
[2:58:25] <%za7az> LUL
[2:58:26] <deviljhojho_> You really showed them
[2:58:33] <$lotharrio> Was there something in that stairwell?
[2:58:36] <Sunstalker> that is a loud ass cricket
[2:58:37] <dan_g_v> it looked like there was a shiny in the stairs corner
[2:58:40] <AmuserName> Wow, one of the Zambos in that stealth section just blatantly clipped through the wall. ***
[2:58:47] <%Monkeyweed21> meth labs need 0 help blowing up and burning down
[2:58:48] <ralphfromdk> Just use a molotov from the outside LUL
[2:58:48] <NireFuster> oh no Pat is enjoying this now too LUL
[2:58:49] <%allups> i belive the game director referred to them as such

[2:59:44] <NireFuster> LUL turning into the MC
[2:59:53] <$lotharrio> Right out of the goo, huh?
[2:59:58] <$dalmek> I like the idea of like "zombies are a huge threat but also, wildlife will fuck you up"
[2:59:59] <%Deft_Thought> So what do they drag people into the nests to make more or something?
[3:00:00] <deviljhojho_> @MelonSouda we grow everywhere tomatoDevious

[3:00:18] <dan_g_v> L4D style rooms
[3:00:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> Probably the 5 nests you're supposed to destroy
[3:00:25] <vonmaultke> They coming home to find someone burnt their shit down
[3:00:25] <JonnyJonstar> what happened?
[3:00:27] <erogenousjones> you opened the freaker closet!
[3:00:30] <ralphfromdk> You can just chuck a molotov into a window from the outside LUL
[3:00:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> The nests?
[3:00:32] <+S7UBBS> Shoulda run out faster
[3:00:35] <%Higure_yoru> this looks like it feels like a fluttery the last of us
[3:00:37] <JonnyJonstar> NotLikeThis
[3:00:37] <%Dylveryn> @Deft_Thought they sleep in there
[3:00:41] <Profmcstevie> Excellent tactic soldier, stand in the room with like 5 paths to check used7
[3:00:43] <sadcucumber123> "You were supposed to destroy them, not join them!"
[3:00:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt I think they came from the nests LUL
[3:00:51] <deviljhojho_> pat got his ass kicked by a bunch of methheads that live in nests made of shit
[3:00:51] <%Deft_Thought> @Dylveryn NHasty
[3:01:01] <Astrophizz> time to burn
[3:01:07] <%jarednotwithsubway> come back for the nests honestly, push story. once you get the aug from hot springs you can clean house
[3:01:09] <SomeAsianDood> I think they don't like having their home burned down pat
[3:01:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> Always
[3:01:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> Let them come out and then you kill them
[3:01:20] <sadcucumber123> "run away!"
[3:01:20] <JonnyJonstar> is this game good?
[3:01:21] <dan_g_v> psychic freakers
[3:01:23] <deviljhojho_> fuck
[3:01:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> They know
[3:01:27] <%HollowBeansVG> this is your life now
[3:01:27] <MelonSouda> that's kind of bullshit.
[3:01:28] <ralphfromdk> oh they know. They are fast AND psychic
[3:01:28] <Astrophizz> how do they know where you are

[3:01:38] <lowlaffles258> game cheated D:
[3:01:39] <deviljhojho_> its solid enough, just generic
[3:01:43] <$lotharrio> Maybe... you should just ride away like Norman Reedus
[3:01:44] <%Taisuru> They can smell arsonists
[3:01:46] <TheViltsuZ> @JonnyJonstar Yeah
[3:01:48] <balthazar758> freakermad
[3:01:50] <BigColossus> oh shit
[3:01:51] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is exactly what grenades are for
[3:01:53] <+cylish> cylish subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[3:01:56] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> @jonnyjonstar It's fun to rip apart for sure.
[3:01:57] <deviljhojho_> Like it has no big flaws outside of that and the dialogue. Dialogue might be a plus tho
[3:01:59] <+demegodz> WOW
[3:02:06] <%CalderGaming> pat no aim good
[3:02:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's legitimately scary sometimes
[3:02:13] <JonnyJonstar> fun to rip apart?
[3:02:15] <myriad_truth> Yeah the game makes you fight for it
[3:02:15] <%jarednotwithsubway> @PatStaresAt come back when you get the AUG
[3:02:15] <sadcucumber123> Get the bike closer pat
[3:02:19] <%cache_22> 1 down, 4 to go.
[3:02:21] <+S7UBBS> That's nothing compared to the ones that come later
[3:02:22] <mr_whet_faartz> this game really is no joke in the begining
[3:02:24] <deviljhojho_> they are like cicadas
[3:02:28] <sadcucumber123> from ur ass LUL
[3:02:29] <deviljhojho_> ugly cicadas
[3:02:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea game is scary
[3:02:48] <deviljhojho_> goddamn oregon
[3:02:48] <Bluewolf544> @PatStaresAt i dont think its you, Projectile scan is screwing with the aim reticle
[3:02:48] <ralphfromdk> They become slightly psychic when you destroy a nest unless you get the fuuuuck out
[3:02:49] <%Dylveryn> Dialogue is absolutely a plus, it's dumb and cheesy enough and the actors know it
[3:02:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> THE NESTS!
[3:02:54] <MelonSouda> I keep seeing shit about Cicadas lately, what's the deal?
[3:03:03] <myriad_truth> The game is rough when you have crappy weapons
[3:03:11] <SomeAsianDood> they're coming out. it's been 17 years
[3:03:12] <+S7UBBS> Ohio
[3:03:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Cicadas are back in fashion
[3:03:19] <deviljhojho_> cicadas just woke up from their long slumber
[3:03:25] <deviljhojho_> also if you cook and eat them you might get high
[3:03:25] <%shadowace2400> wait til you see DA BEARS
[3:03:26] <%jarednotwithsubway> probably not
[3:03:26] <deviljhojho_> its unclear
[3:03:31] <sadcucumber123> but thou must!
[3:03:33] <myriad_truth> Thats what she said!
[3:03:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> What year was 17 years ago. Math hard
[3:03:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> 2004?
[3:03:42] <%jarednotwithsubway> come back with better GUN
[3:03:44] <%cache_22> Do you have enough resources to make more molotovs?
[3:03:44] <ralphfromdk> You don't have to.. it's for camp creds. It's not part of the story
[3:03:45] <kikoeru_san> @keiganofastora I live in the area, they just do this every 17 years
[3:03:47] <deviljhojho_> like 2004?
[3:03:48] <BigColossus> horny bugs appear every 17 year yo make some noice
[3:03:49] <%Puhff> yes
[3:03:50] <SomeAsianDood> 2004
[3:03:51] <%Monkeyweed21> you can do them 1 at a time
[3:03:54] <Riorii> youll come back later since its a fuel spot
[3:03:54] <%allups> 1st-time open-world game its good that they thought of that stuff even if it is kinda janky and not voiced properly
[3:03:55] <%Puhff> 2004
[3:03:56] <sadcucumber123> @myriad_truth LUL LUL LUL
[3:03:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> I live on Long Island. I remember them as a kid

[3:04:01] <deviljhojho_> @kikoeru_san you gonna eat one or what
[3:04:07] <kikoeru_san> Yo it sounds like a UFO is over my house
[3:04:12] <kikoeru_san> hell nah
[3:04:13] <RetributionP> find a police car they normally have ammo
[3:04:14] <quantumteej> Why shoot gun at guy 2 feet away when you got a bat?
[3:04:14] <dan_g_v> the aiming isn't all that good, is it?
[3:04:16] <JonnyJonstar> why does he keep shooting when they are in melee range?
[3:04:17] <vonmaultke> LUL
[3:04:19] <deviljhojho_> i admit the thouguht of eating a bunch of cicadas is rather tempting....
[3:04:19] <%CalderGaming> omg i forgot that this studio started off with BUBSY 3D
[3:04:20] <%allups> i thought he was ur friend
[3:04:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> 2021 minues 20, add 3

[3:05:03] <kikoeru_san> admittedly we all did, I was in 4th grade dude
[3:05:11] <myriad_truth> No, don't worry about it
[3:05:12] <vonmaultke> He can use his knife for a underground shelter but a wooden door is too much?
[3:05:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> Did you cook it first? I imagine it tastes better that way lol
[3:05:29] <諏訪子> very smart
[3:05:31] <deviljhojho_> just fry em with some salt and olive oil
[3:05:48] <+Afterman_> cosmos brain

[3:06:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> @MelonSouda Like one of those giant gummy worms but real

[3:10:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> You don't need the bike to save

[3:13:06] <%jarednotwithsubway> yeyeye
[3:13:07] <%Puhff> i legit thought you meant the SF dude when you said canonically

[3:13:10] <spuginky> gief is a boulder
[3:13:13] <%shurtal> TOO DENSE
[3:13:14] <%jarednotwithsubway> like a rock

[3:13:21] <$lotharrio> You guys ARE buying an inflatable kiddy pool for your dog to enjoy in the summer, right?
[3:13:22] <xeros720> as you can tell, gief is extra thicc
[3:13:22] <balthazar758> so dogs can't swim
[3:13:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> Furry rock
[3:13:25] <+MisterAvry> they totally make doggy life jackets, with little shark fins and such
[3:13:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> Zangief the SF character also does not swim
[3:13:27] <OkamiDude15> gief is made of rats and therefore cannot swim
[3:13:29] <MelonSouda> Get the dog a SCUBA tank

[3:13:50] <%Deft_Thought> Oops
[3:13:50] <%Mr_Pylon> cutscene time skip!
[3:13:51] <%cache_22> The game _has_ to be a specific time of day and start in a specific place.
[3:13:52] <sadcucumber123> they stole this from Rockstar games LUL
[3:13:54] <minty_con> LUL
[3:13:54] <Dirty_Dandere> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:13:55] <BerryliciousDefinition> WhoaHOOOOAAA

[3:14:45] <Psyramics> Visual Calculus: Challenging (success)
[3:14:46] <%Broand> You nailed that visual calculus check
[3:14:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why couldn't that just happen with in-game lighting regardless of time?!?!?
[3:14:50] <+S7UBBS> Its a good game with flaws
[3:14:51] <balthazar758> bikerman
[3:14:53] <dan_g_v> Biker sense can see into the literal past

[3:22:11] <+Crasgnab> @TurtlesAndTentacles sorry to hear that, my condolences
[3:22:12] <+S7UBBS> The nests are made out of poop and twigs
[3:22:17] <Profmcstevie> You'd think poop and branches would burn real good
[3:22:25] <+S7UBBS> They sleep
[3:22:30] <@CreepyPorpoise> Have you seen the price of houses in Oregon
[3:22:32] <@CreepyPorpoise> :C
[3:22:36] <@CreepyPorpoise> no jobs, expensive housing
[3:22:41] <@CreepyPorpoise> thats why they make nests.
[3:22:44] <sadcucumber123> nests burned during the mission will respawn LUL
[3:22:49] <alexandrecau> It's not nest if they are males, it's burrows where they stash shit they find
[3:22:53] <%allups> the game actually tells a lot of the freakers work overtime
[3:23:05] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @crasgnab thank you appreciate it

[3:27:58] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> using her as zombiebait is probably less evil than what your character normally does

[3:28:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> now 6
[3:28:11] <Bluewolf544> @The_Gaming_Karp If you wanna enjoy any zombie anything never ask that question
[3:28:17] <sadcucumber123> What if the freakers are the good guys, and we are mass slaughtering innocent people and children? What if the whole game is just Deacon's psychotic imagination and he's actually killing civilians?
