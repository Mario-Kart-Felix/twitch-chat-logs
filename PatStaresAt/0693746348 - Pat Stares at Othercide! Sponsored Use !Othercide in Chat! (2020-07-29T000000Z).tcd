[0:42:57] <%bluetocho13> the reward is the experience
[0:42:58] <CloudCircus> FUN
[0:42:58] <%BubbaRands> SELF ACCOMPLISHMENT
[0:42:59] <wibbwobbler> coward
[0:43:01] <%Mendin> Challenge Comlpetion pat
[0:43:05] <Ipsenscastle> Halo is so boring to watch
[0:43:06] <%Teintstein> the journey is the reward
[0:43:07] <%XeroSigmaPrime> everyone but 5 will be
[0:43:10] <Darren716> All the good ones are
[0:43:11] <%DappercatEsquire> You could probably bang them out in a month or two before Infinite
[0:43:12] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt the good ones at least
[0:43:12] <Futurecity10> all the ones that matter is on pc
[0:43:13] <+soFISHticated98> you know that click-click-click sound you get when several pros just rapid fire their turns
[0:43:14] <%Mendin> Also 90% of basic mahjong plays itself with the guide in ffxiv
[0:43:15] <BlkFlameKami> who cares it's shit
[0:43:15] <Monkeyweed21> all the ones that matter are
[0:43:15] <+soFISHticated98> that's the reward
[0:43:17] <%Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt All but 5 will be, but frankly 5 sucks\
[0:43:18] <aeonicvector> reach-4 afaik
[0:43:18] <+taren817> I'm pretty sure they are?
[0:43:18] <Darren716> Who gives a fuck about 5?
[0:43:18] <%SWFanatic> The real Mahjong is the Majima we met along the way
[0:43:18] <Scrub_Seeker> halo infinite has a steam page, halo 5 might not be
[0:43:19] <$KreegTTV> all of them worth playing are gonna be out on PC
[0:43:19] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Did you see the gameplay demo for Halo Infinite?
[0:43:20] <@commanderclaw> All the good ones will be
[0:43:20] <%Piemono> Yakuza Mahjong has like 30 pages of instructions
[0:43:21] <%Rumbutt> That's okay because 5 is garbage
[0:43:21] <RoboFussin> I'm too stupid to learn Mah Jongg. I know the basics, but the thousands of win conditions make it rough
[0:43:21] <%Pyroclase> You don't really need to play 4 and 5, they are part of a different story
[0:43:21] <%XeroSigmaPrime> All the good ones are gonna be
[0:43:23] <%superc37> yeah but 5 sucks
[0:43:24] <LoneFonte> wait, half?
[0:43:26] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I've been told that Cortana Best Girl. I wouldn't know
[0:43:27] <+worldbrand> i hear it's fun though
[0:43:27] <Dr_Mooose> who cares about 5
[0:43:27] <Visorak6> 5 is trash anyway
[0:43:28] <suikudo> mahjong makes no fucking sense
[0:43:28] <Retinolgaming> 5 is pee pee anyway.
[0:43:28] <+vwvwvwvwvvvw> all the important ones are on PC
[0:43:29] <%ssjklyco> I find it funny that Sony has released more games on the PC for PS4 than microsoft
[0:43:29] <+SweepTheLegoMyEggo> @PatStaresAt Hooo boy are you gonna have fun with this games font size
[0:43:30] <%superc37> so whp cares
[0:43:33] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Infinite looks like shit
[0:43:35] <Futurecity10> Just play 1 - reach
[0:43:35] <jellssssss20> “On the PeeCee”
[0:43:35] <+A0N33> Halo 5's forge is, but 5's story sucks
[0:43:35] <+gimmickypizza> Only care about Craig
[0:43:36] <ChoculaUltra> why was 5 put in the no pc jail? was it THAT bad?
[0:43:36] <+D00msDayDan> no plans for halo 5 campaign on pc, but also the story is atrocious and looks like infinite will just be skipping over it
[0:43:37] <%Slimshazbot> Same...
[0:43:38] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, who cares about Infinite
[0:43:39] <%maenos2> i mean halo 4 is listed as part of the MCC so
[0:43:39] <speed_weeb> 5 is just fanfic
[0:43:39] <kasios> yeah it looks dry
[0:43:39] <+Remery_> looks poopoo
[0:43:40] <%MidnightBurst12> don't worry about 5
[0:43:41] <+Rofiarf> a lot of people are unimpressed
[0:43:42] <ZeroCruz> But it ends at 3 tho
[0:43:44] <%BubbaRands> WHAT ABOUT INTRINSIC REWARDS PAT?!
[0:43:44] <%DianaTheAscian> its whatever
[0:43:48] <+aslfrasle> How is only half of Halo 5 on the PC!?
[0:43:48] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> Half?
[0:43:48] <%madskull456> it reminds me of the halo 2 trailer
[0:43:48] <BallerSwagBro9k> With Infinity coming to PC I'd say its inevitable
[0:43:49] <%Rumbutt> Infinite looks terrible
[0:43:50] <%Ranryu692> only the Bungie ones mattee
[0:43:51] <%Calek> in a post Doom 2016 and Eternal world, it's hard to get excited for an FPS that's not like those
[0:43:51] <%Lizard0TM> They'll bring Halo 5 regardless of whatever people think if it
[0:43:52] <+gimmickypizza> Looks like poopoo butt
[0:43:59] <%Ranryu692> *matter
[0:44:00] <%superc37> as far as im concerned it ends at 4
[0:44:01] <Ipsenscastle> LIGHTNING
[0:44:06] <+Andrizzleton> i mean it looks like halo 3/reach idk what people were expecting...those games are still what they are
[0:44:10] <%Mendin> Speaking of tedious FF14 grinds, I'm using the pre-game vlogcast to grind 198 carbonized matter for GATHERING QUESTS
[0:44:14] <Ipsenscastle> kameo?
[0:44:16] <+deviljhojho_> what about onlyfans
[0:44:16] <+aslfrasle> What about kickeo?
[0:44:19] <+Rofiarf> cameo?
[0:44:21] <+gimmickypizza> Halo ends at 3

[1:01:05] <Highwang> this is some very 90s alt metal
[1:01:07] <Aydarkzero> a lot of health for just starting unless it's just Tutorial land
[1:01:15] <Zombrocom> It's also a roguelite yeah

[1:02:19] <+AbnormalVoid> nothin' personnel

[1:02:37] <Zombrocom> Even normal movement is super edgy LUL
[1:02:37] <+Exicuren> Ahh, Transistor, maybe?
[1:02:44] <%Typhaeon> I think you got inside his range
[1:02:45] <$spleekle> This aesthetic makes me wish I had a hot alt goth gf

[1:03:08] <SirDogBear> When you edgy enough you can cut through anything with lightning speed PogChamp
[1:03:10] <leinadtonu> It's quite stylish. If I was 16 this would be my aesthetics.

[1:03:35] <%SWFanatic> Cut you CUT YOU
[1:03:35] <%ExpressNode> I just came in but looking at this game it reminds me of Xcom
[1:03:36] <%SWFanatic> SNEK
[1:03:37] <Zombrocom> I think I would like this style if it was just a bit less over the top with it

[1:04:35] <%penitentpentwitch> I assume this is a 'go until you die which progresses story'
[1:04:35] <ChoculaUltra> the game is pretty af
[1:04:43] <+Promessa_EX> is this kurosawa mode
[1:04:47] <%joylent_blue> this is more fire emblem than xcom
[1:04:48] <TrollKing96> This game's overall style just makes me wish it was an action game.

[1:04:54] <%Shadicara> Edge aside it's a nice looking game
[1:04:56] <Aydarkzero> the budget went into the scarf

[1:16:14] <%CzeekyPlays> I was not expecting Xcom when I saw the ads for this game
[1:16:16] <+Exicuren> This is that edgy kid that does their goth as fuck drawings passion project turned videogame
[1:16:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Nordguy I think Vampire: Masquerade is like that.
[1:16:18] <%SWFanatic> #MahjongForever
[1:16:22] <LoneFonte> There needs to be a second character for backstabing i guess
[1:16:25] <%honeyman18> This game a come with an art book and soundtrack and steam.
[1:16:26] <%penitentpentwitch> It looks like they face the first unit that gets near them. So it's the second unit that can backstab.
[1:16:27] <%Kirby_Sauce> Kirby_Sauce gifted a Tier 1 sub to mahjong! They have given 204 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:16:30] <%Skittlesoul> @Kirby_Sauce PrideHeyyy PrideHeyyy

[1:16:45] <%Ninestempest> yet another tactics-style design
[1:16:52] <+AbnormalVoid> "Douche"
[1:16:56] <%DappercatEsquire> that goth kid's lined notebook finally made it onto Steam, and this is the resukt
[1:16:59] <%SWFanatic> My favorite mahjong tiles are the seasons
[1:17:08] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Oh those are so hard to read
[1:17:13] <heartlesshealer> I missed the dono, did Kirby say some crazy shit along with the gift sub?
[1:17:14] <jellssssss20> Bloody Kurasawa mode
[1:17:17] <%sleepy_coffee> Is mahjong the new psaRaffle ?
[1:17:18] <%clockworknate> i heard you can revive them later at a cost
[1:17:19] <%Shadicara> Already looks better than gears tactics
[1:17:22] <IminyourBase> it says 4 at the top
[1:17:23] <%Kirby_Sauce> Kirby_Sauce gifted a Tier 1 sub to mahjonggem! They have given 205 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:17:28] <SirDogBear> So are they even on Earth anymore?
[1:17:30] <%SWFanatic> !Mahjong
[1:17:34] <$Caped_Eggy> On the top it says four more
[1:17:42] <%DappercatEsquire> one of your daughters is a traitor
[1:17:43] <%joylent_blue> its funny that XCOM is what ppl go to instead of FFT or Fire Emblem lol
[1:17:44] <$Caped_Eggy> It's 4 more
[1:17:46] <%goose_attack_almanac> Waifu Tactics
[1:17:48] <%BubbaRands> @Kirby_Sauce That's it you're becoming too powerful LUL
[1:17:49] <%Skittlesoul> @Kirby_Sauce out here doing the good work. Keep it up!!
[1:17:52] <Shardlab> So what is this game like?
[1:17:53] <XxUmbraNinja> GET SMOKED
[1:17:54] <$zackalan> Up to fifty
[1:18:01] <%penitentpentwitch> I almost wish enemies were leaking 'green' or 'blue' of some sort so you can identify them from the environment quicker. Since player characters have the red scarves for 'pop.'
[1:18:09] <+rottingpastry> Is this XCOM with routing because holy shit
[1:18:10] <Daxalog> Its just time units
[1:18:11] <Decarcassor> The aesthetic of this game remind me of The Void.
[1:18:15] <%CzeekyPlays> @joylent_blue I'm guilty of that, only because I wasn't exposed to those two :(
[1:18:18] <$Caped_Eggy> Actually just 1 more I think
[1:18:25] <TheLemuroid> I wouldn't compare this to FE. Def closer to XCOM or FT
[1:18:36] <SGrim> @joylent_blue I guess X-Com is just a better game. gloryShrug
[1:18:40] <+rottingpastry> Overwatch
[1:18:43] <%clockworknate> they are supposed to be oppressive and blend in for that reason
[1:18:46] <%DappercatEsquire> interrupt focused gameplay reminds me of Into the Breach
[1:18:52] <XxUmbraNinja> Blankets
[1:18:59] <sologarza> I miss FFT so much
[1:18:59] <%penitentpentwitch> Darkest X-Com seems the appropriate joke
[1:19:01] <%joylent_blue> i mean its fine LUL XCOM deserves the recognition
[1:19:09] <$Caped_Eggy> You don't heal between missons btw
[1:19:16] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[1:19:17] <Zombrocom> DId she just cut herself with her gun?
[1:19:21] <%clockworknate> holy shit this games almost 50 bucks?
[1:19:23] <%Taisuru> It's very hard to make out what anything actually looks like in this game and that makes me sad because it clearly looks rad
[1:19:38] <%Skittlesoul> hey were is the link for this game?
[1:19:48] <SirDogBear> the gun might have a tiny bayonet, can't tell

[1:19:53] <%goose_attack_almanac> @Skittlesoul type !Othercide
[1:19:53] <%Pyroclase> it's like in XCOM when a ton of enemies charge your dude but never actually attack and they all just stand there awkwardly.
[1:19:54] <PerfectAsymmetry> !othercide
[1:20:01] <+Remery_> Geomancers :(
[1:20:03] <%Ninestempest> it's on steam fam

[1:20:16] <%CzeekyPlays> Hell yeah shield lady
[1:20:18] <Thetruestblacksun> @taisuru You can mess with the contrast of the game, making colors stand out

[1:23:33] <$zackalan> Pat just an FYI, you seem to be wasting AP. AP will fill to max each turn, however, using more than 50 ap will make that character's next turn take twice as long

[1:25:43] <+JerseyBleek> GERMINATE YOUR DAUGHTER
[1:25:44] <+Remery_> don't sacrifice your daughter
[1:25:44] <LorcaNomad> sacrifice? D:
[1:25:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Wait, they can't heal? That sucks
[1:25:47] <Zombrocom> Gotta sac your daughters to heal them
[1:25:49] <%penitentpentwitch> You heal daughters by feeding them another daughter through sacrifice.
[1:25:50] <%CzeekyPlays> BLADESTORM!
[1:25:50] <TheLemuroid> Sounds like you can crush them into gotcha coins
[1:25:52] <Decarcassor> @Teyaric The Void I knew I wasn't the only one seeing it.
[1:25:53] <%bigdumbidiotguy> yeah but beans tho
[1:25:53] <+SweepTheLegoMyEggo> you can only heal daughters by sacrificing others

[1:26:11] <%joylent_blue> but i like my daughters pvpWhy
[1:26:13] <DrStinkers> Don't make me go abraham on your ass
[1:26:16] <%Slimshazbot> This feel weird, right?
[1:26:19] <leinadtonu> kill one to heal another? oof
[1:26:23] <%bigdumbidiotguy> can you equip the buschs baked beans perk
[1:26:30] <%SWFanatic> oh my lord
[1:26:30] <heartlesshealer> you play as a Donner Party
[1:26:32] <%Ninestempest> it's an attack of opportunity basically
[1:26:33] <%CzeekyPlays> Move + attack seems useful
[1:26:37] <%Ranryu692> stance seems better
[1:26:42] <Emaruse> I feel that's not a good way for characters like this to heal
[1:26:47] <Emaruse> Don't make sense
[1:26:59] <%bigdumbidiotguy> she has salami smash
[1:27:05] <%GarbageQueenEllie> That shield is cool

[1:27:31] <+pectusumbra> Jumping Jack Flash it's a BASH BASH BASH
[1:27:34] <TheLemuroid> Wait there are abilities that drain HP but limited healing. Rough.
[1:27:36] <Zombrocom> Shield bash is always the best in every game it's in
[1:27:36] <wibbwobbler> @darkrogue7776 yes
[1:27:38] <Teyaric> REACTION
[1:27:38] <SirDogBear> I think the idea is they all come from the same birthing pool, so sacrificing them just changes them back to orange goo or something
[1:27:40] <heartlesshealer> ???
[1:27:42] <%Typhaeon> Combo attack

[1:32:01] <SirDogBear> if you resurrect daughters do they come back with full hp and same stats when they had died or were sacrificed?
[1:32:04] <%CzeekyPlays> @GarbageQueenEllie and sacrifice all others to elmo psaGib
[1:32:10] <Thetruestblacksun> To incentive chat to play this game, the memories double as buffs to your waifus in the current run and dark soul style lore dumps. Meaning, play well enough, you learn more about the story.
[1:32:10] <%penitentpentwitch> Germinate daughter then attack
[1:32:12] <%Typhaeon> Attack the block
[1:32:14] <Daxalog> Slot the memmories to your skills

[1:32:54] <%goose_attack_almanac> butts are important
[1:32:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I saw an ad of this on twitter, legit thought it was a Nier A sequel
[1:32:55] <Zombrocom> A bit, it's the white hair
[1:32:55] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> No
[1:32:56] <LoneFonte> not really
[1:32:57] <$spardanwarrior> That spear is giving me Nier vibes

[1:33:07] <+RowenCleric> not enough butts
[1:33:10] <CappuccinoGuil> Chat looking at their butts? NEVER!

[1:33:36] <%SirGO0SE> asking for a friend are people modding this?
[1:33:39] <%CzeekyPlays> @SWFanatic I need more DD :(
[1:33:40] <desertpunk247> It does invoke similarities, but with a slight Lovecraft inspiration
[1:33:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just got here, how is the game so far?
[1:33:51] <+rottingpastry> I get Transistor vibes tbh
[1:33:52] <+unknowingchuck> the red cloths are umbilical cords more than likely
[1:34:00] <+TomServal> Is her name really Douche?
[1:34:02] <+hax_metatron> Is this game any fun?
[1:34:03] <Zombrocom> For the record Douce means sober, gentle, and sedate.
[1:34:03] <%bigdumbidiotguy> get a tactical nuke
[1:34:13] <Teyaric> @Valentinius_Anodyne It's The Void themed Darkest Dungeon by way of X-com

[1:35:17] <%SirGO0SE> crazy how much better animated / visually directed this is than Fire Emblem 3h and man I love that game
[1:35:34] <Decarcassor> You could straight up put on of the Brothers from the Void as an enemy in this. They would fit perfectly. Also the lack of color is ... on point.
[1:35:44] <%bigdumbidiotguy> u dun goofed
[1:35:46] <LoneFonte> @darkrogue7776 a gun wielding waifu or a waifu that is a gun?

[1:58:26] <%Mendin> So when does Paige get to play this?
[1:58:29] <%AzureGale> Death is not a hunter unbeknowst to its prey...
[1:58:44] <%penitentpentwitch> Feeding your children other children is definetly edgy
[1:58:46] <heartlesshealer> can't actually use weak daughters to heal. Gotta be the same level or higher =/
[1:58:52] <%weissguard> I feel like I should blast Livin' On A Prayer as I play this.
[1:59:09] <%Mendin> I will say, mandating that you have to raise a stable of characters if for no other reason than organ harvesting is a novel twist
[1:59:10] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> I guess you blend a lot of daughters to keep the tough daughters going

[2:01:11] <Fuji_Apples> this game's almost monochromatic aesthetic is dope
[2:01:21] <%cylish> Ohhhh its bloodborn with just dolls
[2:01:21] <%Nitsorinni> Just like darkest dungeon
[2:01:22] <%penitentpentwitch> A full team is also important

[2:01:24] <+RowenCleric> oh good our daughters arnt dead forever

[2:01:42] <aero160h> hey Pat, is this game fun to play? Cause it's looking kinda meh to me
[2:02:09] <%Nitsorinni> It looks aiight to me. Emo Waifu X-Coom
[2:02:11] <%clockworknate> this game looks super meh
[2:02:14] <Undertakerand619> @valentinius_anodyne. nice. seems cool might pick it up
[2:02:25] <@SoFarFetched> This game will definitely be a yes or no for some people,since some may get turned off on some things.
[2:02:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> You will.
[2:02:39] <SirDogBear> so if you don't take on demons and let them roam do they take over territory or something like in X-Com?
[2:02:44] <@SoFarFetched> So this is probably one of those,definitely watch to see if it pique's your interest on wanting to play it.

[2:03:03] <%annearkie> I get turned off by metaphors and the color gray, will I like this game?

[2:03:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It is an absolutely gorgeous aesthetic for sure
[2:04:01] <%Struggleful> This game is right up my alley. I just wish it had some better music
[2:04:04] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> it has a real "the world has already ended but we are going to kill the culprit anyways" vibes
[2:04:08] <SirDogBear> Pat sacrificed his two daughters to teach his other daughters a lesson BibleThump
[2:04:32] <%clockworknate> could yiu just use guns and stay out of range?
[2:04:51] <%realm_forge> It’s more than free pat! Like 50% off your space money
[2:05:05] <Manwad> @clockworknate You get your shit wreaked by the tankier dudes
[2:05:10] <heartlesshealer> maybe if your gun daughters are powerful enough. Seems like you always start mildly surrounded

[2:13:36] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 13m.
[2:13:45] <mr_slaide> Why is Elmo the greatest being in the universe?
[2:13:48] <Sagara83> @SoFarFetched all right, thanks. doodGood
[2:13:51] <MayorRev> is he about to quit? just got here
[2:13:58] <%derekwst3> Would Buggles be a good name for a fake pokemon? its a bubble bug pokemon
[2:14:02] <@SoFarFetched> no he has to pee a bucket load
[2:14:11] <MayorRev> oh
[2:14:28] <mr_slaide> As an ex-member of the Zaibatsu, Pat is in a constant state of running away and quitting.
[2:14:33] <%clockworknate> i give him until 1130
[2:14:37] <+BlackSunEmperor> Elmo is Outergod from the floof dimension!
[2:14:41] <@SoFarFetched> not as fast as he quit playing Blightbound though LUL
[2:14:52] <%clockworknate> true lol
[2:14:58] <@SoFarFetched> but I guess it was....bound to happen.
[2:15:01] <%madskull456> pat has to strap to the toilet or he blasts off again
[2:15:20] <%gigabreakah> so is there any incentive whatsoever to not turtle the entire game and wait for enemies to come to you? Because taking ANY damage seems catastrophic
[2:15:22] <mr_slaide> No gods or kings, only Elmo.
[2:15:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> What we see of Elmo is merely an attempt by our feeble brains to comprehend his true, cyclopean form
[2:15:37] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> psaGib psaGib psaGib
[2:15:47] <ha2ken> Don't forget that he holds a roll of toilet paper or else he can't go
[2:15:48] <mr_slaide> You mean like Galactus?
[2:15:51] <+prodeuce13> would you rather have 4 fingers or 6 fingers on each hand (thumb remains permanent for either option)

[2:16:23] <%madskull456> lol
[2:16:29] <CursedNobleman> @prodeuce13 do the six fingers share nerves or power?
[2:16:34] <%clockworknate> im surprised nobody made a Patricide joke yet
[2:16:40] <CursedNobleman> how about the 4?
[2:16:56] <%gigabreakah> I guess that's a no

[2:20:23] <Them00n> @PatStaresAt You might be under-prepared bucko.
[2:20:29] <jowi_time> I am calling it now, the game is about a victim of a botched brain surgery
[2:20:30] <suikudo> @Estuko THey are all fucked
[2:20:30] <Manwad> to the blender with them
[2:20:33] <%KishinGrek> hey y'all , how's the game?

[2:20:36] <LoneFonte> and anime
[2:20:38] <%penitentpentwitch> Prepare to be spread apart... all over the countryside
[2:20:39] <marisa_eternal> check the caretakers
[2:20:49] <+someguy1472> Kinda reminds me of some old unity game that was released years ago. Something about playing colonists in Mexico?
[2:20:51] <%Mendin> As Darkest Dungeon said OVER and OVER again: "Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer"
[2:21:06] <CursedNobleman> A death by inches.
[2:21:08] <%penitentpentwitch> This seems like it'll be a quick kill
[2:21:21] <%Rumbutt> bad decisions
[2:21:26] <%clockworknate> booost

[2:22:33] <%realm_forge> @mendin in pat’s case he usually gets his ass stomped in rather quickly. Observe the next 3 min for example.

[2:32:03] <Oncamimus> Shes about to Sincerely die...amiright?
[2:32:05] <marisa_eternal> maybe level up more before attacking boss?
[2:32:18] <Zombrocom> Thats a GUY
[2:32:20] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Oh wow this has tips
[2:32:23] <%clockworknate> So are they just stupid human meatsacks defending themselves against demons with guns and memories?
[2:32:27] <Oncamimus> the art is amaze
[2:32:37] <alephalpha> yeah the tips are real good
[2:32:38] <%LordSDB> good
[2:32:38] <%Calek> they just tell you what to do I like that
[2:32:41] <%Calek> doesn't waste your time
[2:32:44] <%realm_forge> Synthesizing daughter....please wait.....please wait....
[2:32:48] <Oncamimus> cool
[2:32:49] <+ALazo> It just explained all the mechanics
[2:32:53] <@SoFarFetched> oh cool they all have tips
[2:32:57] <alephalpha> SUPER DETERMINISTIC
[2:33:04] <%Mendin> That's flat out their AI
[2:33:08] <%clockworknate> the weak go first
[2:33:11] <wibbwobbler> its like chess?
[2:33:14] <%Pyroclase> That's REALLY interesting, I like it
[2:33:19] <ha2ken> I wonder how Woolie would feel about this game
[2:33:19] <LoneFonte> GOOD
[2:33:22] <heartlesshealer> neat
[2:33:28] <%Typhaeon> Yess, give me Cheese Simulator 2020
[2:33:29] <%Mendin> Considering you appear to be going through TIme Loops, learning enemy patterns like that makes a hell of a lot of sense
[2:33:29] <%AzureGale> It's like 3D chess
[2:33:31] <%clockworknate> people use weak daughters as traps too
[2:33:35] <Kurrisum> Pat, the rez
[2:33:36] <%silverira> psaBlep
[2:33:37] <%realm_forge> That art tho
[2:33:42] <CursedNobleman> @ha2ken QCF isnt working. how do i combo? LUL
[2:33:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Who woulda thunk the edgiest omage would also be the most forgiving?
[2:33:47] <Visorak6> Its because the game is unforgivingly hard
[2:33:49] <%Typhaeon> You have a token also
[2:33:50] <suikudo> one guy
[2:33:50] <Oncamimus> the art is worth it
[2:33:52] <alephalpha> this game is fanatsic it mainly need smore content and randomness
[2:33:53] <+cronx90> Anyone else read the title of this game as Ottercide and think it was about killing otters?
[2:33:56] <%Pyroclase> I wouldn't be surprised if it has like, mid-to-endgame problems or something
[2:33:56] <Oncamimus> if nothing else
[2:33:57] <%Calek> I'd imagine a lot of people don't like the healing mechanic, and having to lose to get srtonger
[2:34:07] <Zombrocom> The thing I saw people complaining about is it gets rather repetive and grindy
[2:34:08] <%marsantas> Diehard rouguelike fans don't like the non-random
[2:34:10] <alephalpha> it's main issue is it's a roguelike without enough variety
[2:34:15] <%penitentpentwitch> A lot of reviews mention not finishing the game
[2:34:15] <$sylphyyyy> OH THIS GAME!!! I'm so glad you're playing this, I saw an ad and wanted to see how it plays
[2:34:16] <%Mendin> psaHoldon
[2:34:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Steam is like 82% positive, I wouldn't call that middling
[2:34:23] <%afronooch> yoooooo

[2:34:29] <+Estuko> BibleThump bring ack your FAVORITE DAUGHTER
[2:34:31] <%Atomik456> what ive heard is aside from soome peoople balking at the difficulty it stretches it's content a bit thin later on
[2:34:36] <%clockworknate> kinda feels like staring at a picture for two hours
[2:34:39] <+GenesisKnight> They can be killed by your poor choices so many times now
[2:34:41] <alephalpha> so great agme with great ideas it just need smore stuff to make runs different
[2:34:43] <mr_slaide> So many fine ass waifus.
[2:34:46] <@SoFarFetched> think I heard an elmo screm
[2:34:49] <%realm_forge> Wake up honey, time to go die again!
[2:34:51] <darkwolf_0> no memories
[2:35:00] <heartlesshealer> awesome, you can bring them back into new recollections
[2:35:08] <Zombrocom> She looks traumatized
[2:35:17] <%Typhaeon> Looks like they kinda set you up to fail the first run but let you build a full B-team in round 2
[2:35:19] <%DakotaMacDoodle> DakotaMacDoodle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Just got back from retail hell how is the game

[2:35:48] <%penitentpentwitch> There is the town event in Darkest Dungeon that resurrects heroes
[2:35:53] <wibbwobbler> darkest dungeon 2 could be interesting
[2:35:55] <%DensityD> fuggin, why?
[2:35:55] <%TopTierHarley> Is this an XCOM?
[2:35:59] <ha2ken> Drag your daughter back even if death was relief
[2:35:59] <+EternalJedi> limesD I'm loving this OST
[2:36:00] <Sol_Install> bruh
[2:36:09] <+AWanderingKenku> Resurrect characters in DD? Uhhh... no thanks
[2:36:10] <Oncamimus> this is giving me like...goth suckerpunch/Claymore anime vibes
[2:36:11] <%Rumbutt> Damn right no Mercy, she died last run oroLUL
[2:36:14] <alephalpha> you can move farther than that
[2:36:14] <$sylphyyyy> squeaks we're just hanging out together all night today huh lmao
[2:36:15] <%silverira> if you are good enough you don't lose heroes in DD
[2:36:19] <%Alpha8087> This music tho
[2:36:21] <alephalpha> that only the limite for 50 ap
[2:36:25] <%DensityD> gun
[2:36:37] <CursedNobleman> use your gun kata SwiftRage
[2:36:40] <Monkeyweed21> Is this Sucker Punch X-Com?
[2:36:42] <CurrySauseBandit> Isn't Darkest Dungeon whole stated thing, that people will die?
[2:36:47] <Oncamimus> gunkata!
[2:36:55] <alephalpha> enemeis don't atatck on the turn they spawn
[2:37:07] <CursedNobleman> darkest dungeons selling point is the stress mechanic
[2:37:13] <%goose_attack_almanac> Is this a more involved Into the Breach, but Waifus not Robots
[2:37:26] <%DensityD> is that true or is that psa1guy
[2:37:30] <%DensityD> woolieONEGUY
[2:37:31] <%zestyArsenic> im pretty sure enemies will attack on spawn, if youre close enough
[2:37:38] <%Calek> we know they move at least
[2:37:41] <Monkeyweed21> was this game made by Zack Snyder?
[2:37:42] <CursedNobleman> says you, god, rocket mech is so hot Kreygasm
[2:37:47] <Oncamimus> hmmm that guys head vibrations are concerning
[2:37:53] <%goose_attack_almanac> That one enemy that was spawned moved away from Pat the turn it spawned
[2:37:54] <cerazor01> wow lame
[2:37:59] <alephalpha> @DensityD I migth ahve just been positioned super lucky for my entire run but I doubt that
[2:38:01] <Visorak6> Its too late
[2:38:05] <+Estuko> LUL
[2:38:06] <narusao> LUL
[2:38:07] <Kurrisum> just shoot em
[2:38:10] <%zestyArsenic> gunners always run away
[2:38:13] <$sylphyyyy> LUL
[2:38:15] <%Mendin> I just realized the game's character aesthetic is just "What if Nahiri from MtG but more of her"
[2:38:18] <%DensityD> gunswordtrickGUNSWORDTRICK
[2:38:19] <%Typhaeon> welp
[2:38:33] <%psydaku> !othercide
[2:38:33] <@Moobot> Check out Othercide! Seems pretty rad! https://t.co/VyOQZNSznF?amp=1
[2:38:36] <CursedNobleman> @Mendin all of the kor look like nahiri
[2:38:38] <%Typhaeon> OK that was really smart
[2:38:38] <Zombrocom> Game needs more classes
[2:38:56] <$Zalthia> @mendin disagree, not angry enough
[2:38:57] <alephalpha> @Mendin I unoo it's more like what if a bunch of girl dantes
[2:38:58] <LoneFonte> there's 2 more that aren't unlocked yet
[2:39:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Mendin Into the Nahiriverse
[2:39:12] <SirMcSlushy> This game seems pretty cool.
[2:39:26] <marisa_eternal> I know there is at least 1 more class
[2:39:30] <Parapattern> The girl's are fighting!
[2:39:35] <wibbwobbler> i need like 10 daughters at once plz
[2:39:38] <%silverira> @CurrySauseBandit the premise is making the best of a dire situation, the whole thing of DD its that it is a very unforgiving game at first but the more you know the easier it is
[2:39:38] <alephalpha> Shadowround is super good
[2:39:43] <Kurrisum> Have we figured out if the abilities are % of max health or current health?
[2:39:45] <%Atomik456> @PatStaresAt you gonna try Grounded?
[2:39:53] <Monkeyweed21> is this Sucker Punch @PatStaresAt ?
[2:39:54] <%AzureGale> Probably eyeliner
[2:39:54] <Oncamimus> woooo weird eyeball stuff
[2:39:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Just like their papa
[2:39:56] <SirMcSlushy> Its got that xcom feel, but considering you can just revive characters and the artstyle it feels more lax. Which is good, frankly.
[2:39:56] <Zombrocom> I think its cause she died
[2:40:05] <Scrub_Seeker> the obsidian survival game @PatStaresAt
[2:40:05] <+walnutcast> honey i shrunk the kids survival crafting game
[2:40:11] <+RowenCleric> Honey I shrunk the Kids surivval game
[2:40:12] <%realm_forge> They got it from u pat
[2:40:13] <%joylent_blue> its the honey i shrunk the kids game
[2:40:13] <%trustycoyote> Honey I Shrunk the Kids game
[2:40:14] <%king_wragles> I think Grounded is that game with the shrunk kids
[2:40:26] <$Zalthia> Their eyeliner seems to change as they level up/gain traits?
[2:40:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Well it was nice knowing you, Daughters.
[2:40:35] <+taren817> Oh boy
[2:40:39] <+visidan> survival game hell ye-zzzz
[2:40:44] <Parapattern> "Well, you can tell him that he's grounded!"
[2:40:45] <Oncamimus> magic eyeliner?
[2:40:45] <%king_wragles> I think the eye thing is because you resurrected her
[2:40:49] <%AzureGale> Pat's ass is impossible, what?
[2:40:52] <%Valdorick> Gottem
[2:40:53] <$sylphyyyy> pat what
[2:40:54] <%clockworknate> this is , honey i resurrected the kids and sent them off to die again
[2:40:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This is like if Charlie's Angels was even more waifu. And goth
[2:40:55] <%penitentpentwitch> Time to see Pats Impossible Ass, Paige Approved!
[2:40:57] <wibbwobbler> they better not pull a bioware on obsidian
[2:41:01] <Oncamimus> cool
[2:41:11] <%Typhaeon> 12 enemies seems doable
[2:41:14] <$CommanderSqueaks> Great, you have now motivated your daughters to fly headfirst into death to free them from the memory if you doing that, Pat.
[2:41:15] <%Mendin> Now THAT is a Darkest Dungeon intro quote
[2:41:20] <%Calek> curious if the Shards you use for meta progression are used up or you just gradually get more and more
[2:41:25] <$Zalthia> Metro
[2:41:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Cool how their scarves double as their health bars
[2:41:43] <+P00kie89> !othercide
[2:41:43] <@Moobot> Check out Othercide! Seems pretty rad! https://t.co/VyOQZNSznF?amp=1
[2:41:49] <%Atomik456> i mean there's been a streak oof obsidian being intoo survival stuff since new vegas so i feel like this is internally motivated. @wibbwobbler
[2:41:59] <%silverira> this game screams Xcom, bloodbourne, and wafus
[2:42:15] <alephalpha> the longer you take the more time for more enemies ot spawn
[2:42:17] <CursedNobleman> i dont mix waifus with ironman games. no sir
[2:42:19] <Kurrisum> skulls?
[2:42:25] <%SirGO0SE> use Apdawg
[2:42:27] <SirMcSlushy> Can you select them and see their movement?
[2:42:35] <alephalpha> yes
[2:42:48] <$Zalthia> Part of Grounded's trailer was about how its nothing like Obsidians normal fair
[2:42:54] <%clockworknate> whats apdawg?
[2:43:01] <SirMcSlushy> Into The Breach is great\
[2:43:01] <%penitentpentwitch> Yup
[2:43:03] <%Atomik456> the aesthetic for this game is so fucking god
[2:43:04] <alephalpha> yeha it's more like breach
[2:43:05] <%DensityD> enter my breach Kreygasm
[2:43:07] <Saltmeisterr> OOOH
[2:43:12] <CurrySauseBandit> @silverira I got that. But, i'm asking more so for the "take a character back form death mechanic". I didn't get to see how the mechanic works in this game, but it seems like it'd be a bad mechanic in DD assuming you keep resolve levels.
[2:43:17] <%DappercatEsquire> Instead of mecha chess, it's goth waifu chess
[2:43:22] <%zestyArsenic> i kind of wish you could attack the spawn points in some manner, but i havent got anything for that yet
[2:43:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> This game gives you perfect knowledge, so if something goes wrong it is completely your fault, like Into the Breach.
[2:43:25] <%Calek> and knowing exactly what their AI is going to do through studying the codex, this definitely makes it more Into The Breach
[2:43:25] <wibbwobbler> @atomik456 i hope so, but a rpg company pivoting into multiplayer focused is a lot like bioware
[2:43:27] <%SirGO0SE> @clockworknate <3 ill remember this
[2:43:33] <CursedNobleman> @CurrySauseBandit its extremely rare, you keep resolve
[2:43:37] <%goose_attack_almanac> I'll take that trade @DappercatEsquire
[2:43:43] <CursedNobleman> maybe once every 50+ weeks
[2:43:46] <Saltmeisterr> Can u block spawns like in into the breach?
[2:44:03] <%clockworknate> @SirGO0SE i will cherish it always!
[2:44:24] <$Zalthia> This game sure likes its... ARMIES :P
[2:44:39] <SirMcSlushy> Tank R Us
[2:45:01] <%Atomik456> @wibbwobbler fair nuff, guess im moore optimistic in this case cause oof other stuff they're doing and how grounded is explicitly a small internal team rather than something the whole company woorked on
[2:45:07] <%silverira> @CurrySauseBandit In DD ti is straight up random while in this game it looks like you need a rare resouce
[2:45:12] <alephalpha> lunge deals more dmage
[2:45:19] <%Atomik456> and how obsidian has long had survival stuff
[2:45:41] <marisa_eternal> music is bumping
[2:45:47] <Saltmeisterr> does moving take ap?
[2:45:52] <alephalpha> slash twice
[2:45:56] <%Paperware> Anyone else play Troubleshooters on steam? It's kinda like a Korean RPG Xcom
[2:46:14] <Teyaric> Man, Woolie is going to plotz when he gets a hold of this. Kingdom Death Monster meets Into the Breach by way of The Void? He's going to blow his top.
[2:46:18] <aluddss> Troubleshooters feels jank
[2:46:19] <%clockworknate> this game would make a cool top down dmc
[2:46:28] <wibbwobbler> @atomik456 yup, i really like their library so I'm holding onto hope fornow
[2:46:33] <LoneFonte> @Saltmeisterr yep, and changes on how far you go
[2:46:44] <HorribleHog> How is it?
[2:46:52] <SirMcSlushy> Does saving AP give you any benefit?
[2:46:57] <Saltmeisterr> oh wow so its like Codename STEAM too
[2:47:09] <Oncamimus> ah just like my ex
[2:47:26] <SirMcSlushy> Gotcha, so its a last resort.
[2:47:28] <HorribleHog> laeKEKW
[2:47:33] <CursedNobleman> codename STEAM LUL
[2:47:35] <SirMcSlushy> Or a big play scenario
[2:47:36] <%Dakuu75> doodBigBrain
[2:47:41] <alephalpha> when you wanan go off or push your turn so far back that your recations alst for along time
[2:47:46] <Visorak6> live to fight another day
[2:47:50] <alephalpha> shadow round is fantastic after putting youself to 100
[2:47:52] <Daxalog> Did he beat the first boss yet?
[2:47:56] <%Paperware> @aluddss Yeah it could be better, funny thing is that I hate the fact that it feels like it was made from an MMO
[2:48:12] <LoneFonte> @Daxalog nope
[2:48:14] <Saltmeisterr> im like the only person that remembers that game exists
[2:48:27] <SirMcSlushy> Yeah, stradegy wise it seems neat.
[2:48:27] <%clockworknate> so time only moves when you do?
[2:48:42] <Oncamimus> are their scarves their lifebars? i just caught that
[2:48:47] <%Dakuu75> I JUST noticed the big creepy statue-guy at the right side of the arena
[2:48:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hey now, I remember Codename STEAM. Never played it, but stilll B)
[2:48:58] <Saltmeisterr> they are
[2:48:59] <alephalpha> massive shot just does a lot of damage
[2:49:00] <Saltmeisterr> neat
[2:49:06] <alephalpha> it's a big delaya tatck
[2:49:17] <Visorak6> @PatStaresAt I think you have to break their facing ie flank to cancel it?
[2:49:18] <HorribleHog> is it... X-COM for edgelords?
[2:49:18] <%king_wragles> Oh hey, the scarves show their health
[2:49:18] <%Typhaeon> Moving close enough cancels it
[2:49:22] <brovietto> I think you have move real close to them, not just move to get them to cancel the shot
[2:49:23] <Oncamimus> thats a really neat detail
[2:49:35] <%Mendin> It's Enter The Darkest-COM
[2:49:37] <%clockworknate> so there is overwatch
[2:49:38] <%Dakuu75> @HorribleHog lol
[2:49:49] <CursedNobleman> @HorribleHog into the breach for edgelords apparently
[2:49:57] <%Mendin> *Into the Darkest-COM
[2:50:06] <HorribleHog> CursedNobleman Ah!
[2:50:13] <alephalpha> the amount of edge is incredible
[2:50:18] <CursedNobleman> this game needs more wayne june
[2:50:23] <Saltmeisterr> Codename Into the Darkest-com
[2:50:25] <aluddss> @Paperware never really felt that way until you mentioned it, wouldn't be too surprised if it was initially
[2:50:31] <zmuno> You can attack in diagonal
[2:50:38] <CursedNobleman> or the supergiant games narrator
[2:50:46] <Oncamimus> the edge has barely begun!
[2:50:47] <markfletcher> This looks like some monochrome bore
[2:50:56] <%clockworknate> ouef
[2:51:12] <Visorak6> time to just spam attacks
[2:51:15] <alephalpha> spend it all
[2:51:16] <%Mendin> Nah nah nah, this needs Ron Perlman
[2:51:16] <%Calek> don't attack when they spawn confirmed I guess
[2:51:21] <Daxalog> This is the end
[2:51:23] <Zombrocom> That one hurt
[2:51:27] <%silverira> run awayyyyy
[2:51:31] <%clockworknate> noice!
[2:51:34] <alephalpha> @Calek I wouldn't lie
[2:51:40] <Zombrocom> Time for candide to eat one of her sisters
[2:51:45] <CursedNobleman> ghosts with GUNS?! Kreygasm
[2:51:56] <alephalpha> @Calek though disclaimer ther emight eb enemie sin late reras I don't know
[2:51:58] <Saltmeisterr> hey is that ron pearlman roguelike in early access yet?
[2:52:02] <%Mendin> Actually since everyone's a lady in this, narrator should be whoever bellows THE SHADOW REMAINS CAST from Bayonetta
[2:52:07] <CursedNobleman> dark in themes or just shading?
[2:52:09] <+HelloImTom08> oh sick i was thinking about getting this game and pat playing it
[2:52:09] <%AzureGale> Dark, metaphorically or literally?
[2:52:10] <Saltmeisterr> West of Dead i think its called?
[2:52:12] <%Mendin> Or Exposition Grandma from DS2/3
[2:52:17] <mr_slaide> Goth waifus? Sign me up.
[2:52:20] <%silverira> Ghost on Ghost violence has to stop
[2:52:35] <CursedNobleman> if you play darkest dungeon correctly, you send in greenhorns into a pit of vomiting pigs to scrounge up gold, then fire them when they get PTSD
[2:52:37] <%clockworknate> These ladies do actually look like their names would be Candice
[2:52:43] <Parapattern> Time to make a sister smoothie
[2:52:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> What's the split on this game being unreasonably hard and Pat being a big bumble?
[2:52:50] <%Mendin> @CursedNobleman Time loop shards of a dead superwarrior called The Mother fighting nightmare incursions of The Other so yes
[2:52:55] <Oncamimus> by doing shop therapy? i agree
[2:53:01] <Manwad> "This darkness is overwhelming" says the gun kata-ing chick
[2:53:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> How much of it is Pat being bad and how much of it is this game being actually kind of unfair?
[2:53:09] <mr_slaide> Elmo disagrees with all of this.
[2:53:11] <suikudo> It must be done
[2:53:13] <Zombrocom> Game is hard, but it's a roguelike, so you are supposed to lose and die and try again stronger
[2:53:15] <%Mendin> More bumble and not a lot of rebirth strat yet, I think
[2:53:18] <T_Sasquatch> I pirated darkest dungeon. Died in the tutorial and uninstalled it immediately LUL
[2:53:19] <%Typhaeon> Welp guess Candice is benched then
[2:53:19] <alephalpha> @CommanderSqueaks game snot unreasonably hard but pat is currently at expected amount of bumbles
[2:53:20] <Sol_Install> yes
[2:53:28] <+ALazo> They have to be the same level or higher
[2:53:28] <%clockworknate> Pat is getting noticeably better
[2:53:30] <SirMcSlushy> Oh boy.
[2:53:39] <%silverira> wait you sacrifice heroes to heal other heroes?
[2:53:39] <Oncamimus> hmmm
[2:53:40] <suikudo> Thats fucked
[2:53:44] <%Mendin> The game explicitly telling you how the games enemies AI works is pretty damn fair
[2:53:52] <alephalpha> poor candide revived to get trashe din the firts fight
[2:53:53] <CursedNobleman> what does sacrifice do, and why shouldnt he just sac everyone? LUL
[2:53:54] <SirMcSlushy> I smell the sidelines with her for a while.
[2:53:54] <Parapattern> Birth some daughters
[2:53:56] <ha2ken> Always make sure your daughter is high enough
[2:53:56] <Manwad> Yeah you can blitz the stages once you really know what you're doing
[2:53:59] <LoneFonte> @silverira yep, you can't heal otherwise
[2:54:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh, oh I see. This is the Darkest Dungeon problem of Pat not liking that you're SUPPOSED to throw people to the meat grinder until you work your way to victory.
[2:54:06] <mustachegolem> seems very grindy
[2:54:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Alas, it seems to be Candide's fate to die repeatedly
[2:54:20] <%YakumoYomi> It's designed so even the daughters you sacrifice aren't just throwaway grunts, and you actually have to put time into them if you want to use them as fodder.
[2:54:21] <%TheotherKristian> Where is link for game?
[2:54:25] <CursedNobleman> @CommanderSqueaks i love the meat grinder! its horrible LUL
[2:54:32] <+dmtjinni> My dad gave me his card should I buy this? response asap

[2:54:42] <Oncamimus> short hair team?
[2:54:45] <%Mendin> Douce 2: The Legend of Curly's Gold
[2:54:54] <SirMcSlushy> Wonder how many classes there are.
[2:54:57] <%Mendin> Demon Sperm
[2:54:57] <CursedNobleman> @dmtjinni if you havent tried into the breach, get that first?
[2:55:05] <Zombrocom> There are 3 classes
[2:55:06] <mr_slaide> Woolie approves this short haired team.
[2:55:09] <nonnanika> how long has pat been streaming this?
[2:55:21] <SirMcSlushy> I gotcha.

[2:55:33] <%ElkRiverDog> !uptime
[2:55:33] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 55m.
[2:55:35] <Oncamimus> youd love that you freak
[2:55:37] <%AzureGale> Was that supposed to be creepy
[2:55:37] <Monkeyweed21> is this Sucker Punch? @PatStaresAt
[2:55:38] <%Rumbutt> the codex entries make it seem that way
[2:55:55] <alephalpha> 4 classes
[2:55:58] <Kurrisum> Focus Home interactive
[2:55:59] <%clockworknate> i would just rename my new soldiers with l ost heroes names on xcom and pretend nothing happened
[2:56:02] <alephalpha> \part of the reason this game need smore content
[2:56:05] <aluddss> any word on it having a steam workshop for mods?
[2:56:07] <Saltmeisterr> why the fuck was demon sperm trendy?
[2:56:13] <Parapattern> Elmo is full of spiders
[2:56:15] <Saltmeisterr> trending*
[2:56:22] <Oncamimus> XD
[2:56:24] <T_Sasquatch> @saltmeisterr Trump

[2:58:16] <%M3djedx> umbraHYPERS umbraHYPERS
[2:58:22] <Oncamimus> yuck....@EternalJedi too real
[2:58:28] <Oncamimus> lol
[2:58:48] <alephalpha> your welcome
[2:58:55] <+Estuko> new doctor lady ALSO claims medicine being made from ALIEN DNA so..
[2:58:55] <%DensityD> good
[2:58:57] <%silverira> I don't wanna be mean but all this female models looks like porn games ad
[2:59:01] <CursedNobleman> SeemsGood woolieONEGUY
[2:59:05] <Zombrocom> Didn't one attack you on its first turn once?
[2:59:13] <Zombrocom> Or did I imagine that
[2:59:14] <%Typhaeon> Except for that one plague doctor that did attack on his first turn
[2:59:28] <T_Sasquatch> @silverira is that meant to be a bad thing ? LUL
[2:59:29] <%arcaderabbit48> So is this game worth it? It seems awesome, the aesthetic is great, and the gameplay is solid, but how grindy and repetitive does it get? Cause I loved Darkest Dungeon, but dropped off pretty quick when I realized how repetitive it was
[2:59:34] <Silly_Duckling> Yeah, I think if they spawn next to you, they might get a swing, but that only happened once
[2:59:39] <LoneFonte> maybe it depends on the enemy
[2:59:41] <%clockworknate> it happened before
[2:59:54] <marisa_eternal> edgy goth gf chess roguelike cthulhu thingy
[2:59:56] <SirMcSlushy> Im confused with how the initiative tracker works
[3:00:01] <heartlesshealer> then do it
[3:00:03] <Zombrocom> @arcaderabbit48 Some steam reviews say it's very grindy and repetititive
[3:00:03] <%Typhaeon> Right, the no movement was a factor
[3:00:15] <heartlesshealer> it's the best
[3:00:28] <dinnydanny777> Is this demonic Xcom?
[3:00:40] <alephalpha> @SirMcSlushy if you spend 50 ap or less you get moves bakc 50 at the end of your turn and if you spend more up to hudnreed you get= moved back 100
[3:00:41] <CursedNobleman> just get a goth GF mod for darkest dungeon
[3:00:42] <+HelloImTom08> this some nice butt rock
[3:00:44] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[3:00:45] <%Cervarian> Reminds me of Claymore a bit.
[3:00:52] <alephalpha> then skill can ove enemies and alies on the timeline
[3:00:52] <+HelloImTom08> awww its over
[3:00:54] <%clockworknate> are the maps always this tiny with no elevation in buildings or anything different at all?
[3:00:55] <Oncamimus> ^
[3:00:55] <Zombrocom> ThEy CoLleCT piEceS of BroKEn SoUlS
[3:01:07] <SirMcSlushy> So the initiative tracker shows your current characters initiative for their next turn?
[3:01:09] <Oncamimus> XD
[3:01:12] <alephalpha> putting yourself at 100 is actually great for stuff like shadowed bullets
[3:01:12] <Decarcassor> Not enough people have played The Void and it shows.
[3:01:25] <heartlesshealer> oh, no yeah good display is happening
[3:01:26] <+N0bdyNoOne> !othercide
[3:01:26] <@Moobot> Check out Othercide! Seems pretty rad! https://t.co/VyOQZNSznF?amp=1
[3:01:31] <alephalpha> @clockworknate map variety seems rela low
[3:01:48] <alephalpha> like my opinion on this game is it just needs more stuff
[3:01:52] <Daxalog> You bursted
[3:01:52] <heartlesshealer> these enemies got speed
[3:02:06] <Manwad> fast fuckers
[3:02:06] <%arcaderabbit48> How many classes are there in the game?
[3:02:16] <alephalpha> 4
[3:02:19] <Zombrocom> Seems to be just 3
[3:02:19] <CursedNobleman> 3?
[3:02:20] <alephalpha> one ened sot eb unlocke
[3:02:30] <alephalpha> 4
[3:02:31] <marisa_eternal> the dev's did say they were working on map variety patch in the discord I think
[3:02:35] <alephalpha> one needs ot eb unlocke
[3:02:41] <%silverira> kill those fiends porn game lady
[3:02:52] <Zombrocom> Oh yeah? What's the fourth class?
[3:02:59] <alephalpha> @marisa_eternal that's promising I can honestly see myself truly loving this game if they continue to support it
[3:03:00] <%clockworknate> @alephalpha it honestly seems like a super dumbed down xcom with no colour
[3:03:23] <heartlesshealer> attack of opportunity type skills are always nice
[3:03:26] <marisa_eternal> I think the other class is scythes?
[3:03:28] <Zombrocom> It's more into the breach than xcom
[3:03:28] <Oncamimus> How new is this game?
[3:03:29] <+flexin_apex> nice
[3:03:34] <%DensityD> never not kill
[3:03:36] <%arcaderabbit48> This seems like the kind of game I'll check up on in like a year after they've patched it up?
[3:03:58] <Zombrocom> It came out like yesterday
[3:04:11] <CursedNobleman> @heartlesshealer tUrN eConoMy
[3:04:22] <%Pyroclase> OOF
[3:04:31] <Zombrocom> Oh fuck
[3:04:33] <LoneFonte> HOW
[3:04:40] <%clockworknate> Id say just buy this on the day that pat streams it without being sponsored to do so lol
[3:04:49] <Oncamimus> Ah...in that case...we need to wait before it gets killer awesome probs
[3:04:51] <alephalpha> @clockworknate playinga round with the timeline stuff makes combat stuff very different then xcom and theres oa lot of interseting situation that you can think through that and stuff being mostly detreminitic make it very different and yeah the monochromeness becomes really grating
[3:04:56] <heartlesshealer> I don't wanna hear that in alternating caps if we're not talking Pathfinder 1E Witch. Which was broken
[3:05:07] <Oncamimus> hmmm
[3:05:08] <%DensityD> just like every man
[3:05:12] <%AzureGale> Your waifu is dying
[3:05:14] <Zombrocom> Man, the narration dialogue is getting super repetitive
[3:05:15] <+Shacklebox> Pat loves to damage women
[3:05:16] <dinnydanny777> Now they need that tattoo
[3:05:30] <CursedNobleman> the best part about shadowrun is playing a drone guy with two controls LUL
[3:05:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> This stream has been a long fucking tirade of bad voiceclips for you pat
[3:05:35] <$Zalthia> Those shield plague dudes are tough unless youre backstabbing

[3:05:53] <Oncamimus> yeah isnt it?
[3:05:57] <+Taglog7> is this game woolie bait?
[3:05:58] <Oncamimus> im digging it
[3:05:59] <%clockworknate> I would definitely try it out but not at nearly 50$
[3:06:01] <%arcaderabbit48> Soooooo, what's the actual plot here?
[3:06:02] <ShichiNoBushi> Magika is suffering.
[3:06:10] <alephalpha> @clockworknate it's 25
[3:06:15] <%DensityD> has Pat ever followed a "I must protect her smile at any cost" for anybody?
[3:06:19] <alephalpha> and I still think it's a bit of an ask
[3:06:23] <Kitafin> ?
[3:06:23] <CursedNobleman> huhhm?
[3:06:24] <Monkeyweed21> when do we find out this is all the dreams one of the girls is having before she gets lobotomized @PatStaresAt ?
