You’re a cool dude, thanks for all the laughs. “Fun” comic book fact: Gwen Stacy has an affair with Norman Osborn in Europe (it’s implied she’s never done anything with Peter) and gets pregnant with Goblin twins. The real reason he threw her off a bridge was to cover it up. This is from Sins Past, a story that everyone hates. COMICS!
[0:06:01] <Valdorick> 2019 was a pretty crazy year, don't even remember what happened for most of September onward.

[0:24:51] <%maskedriderhero> Pat likes it raw confirmed
[0:24:52] <%SirGO0SE> RAW DAWG
[0:24:52] <Zedimonx5> 200% ice attack
[0:24:52] <%zeroarturia> @butthurtdave yeppers. Monster spoilers got to him.
[0:24:52] <%ElenaManetta> dont use great sword NERD
[0:24:52] <butthurtdave> Pat, what do you think of the perfect guard attack boost skill shit?
[0:24:53] <keiji_maede> you're wrong!!
[0:24:55] <framewindowcleaner> Great Sword is trash
[0:24:55] <+VantaXIV> RAW
[0:24:56] <42nfl19> Pat confirmed for KEEING IT RAW
[0:25:00] <%dekkitout> I think the Glavenus GS is raw
[0:25:02] <%Piemen99> i just got here. We going in RAW?
[0:25:03] <+Dash_rendar89> HAMMER BOIS UNITE!
[0:25:07] <%king_wragles> Elementless gives a %boost, GS has a lot of damage it can gain if there's no element
[0:25:13] <brambobelurkin> Glav GS was fire in teh past
[0:25:19] <+Pookiedaexzile> raw slut...just like gwen and the goblins d7ck is the ocd
[0:25:20] <Mr_pwng3> make sure to use the clutch claw
[0:25:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> Glaceon used RAW attack! It's not very effective...
[0:25:25] <Zanziay> weak boiiisssss
[0:25:26] <%ElenaManetta> I love how overshadowed Terry got by a Mii costume
[0:25:27] <%ThePuddingDead> ThePuddingDead subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 9 month streak! Twitch seems to eat my msg's like candy, but just wanted to say I'm getting my Degree in 3 months, our stream baby is still healthy, and wanted to know if you'll be pre-ordering the digital deluxe. You're the best dude.
[0:25:29] <ashuckel> but what if it has 2000 element :U
[0:25:30] <%ElenaManetta> Poor Terry
[0:25:35] <%umbypokochan> what are elmo bunches?
[0:25:36] <brambobelurkin> The event GS is still solid on raw dps
[0:25:39] <Ner234> LUL
[0:25:41] <Valdorick> DO YOU!?
[0:25:41] <%umbypokochan> is that chunks of his hair? :P
[0:25:42] <%SoFarFetched> but she can't swim without her glasses LUL
[0:25:43] <%spiritofmojave> are you sure
[0:25:43] <%NeroInfinite> LUL
[0:25:44] <%ElenaManetta> PaIGE WAS A SWIMMING CHAMpion
[0:25:46] <jemerald0> Sans as a Mii costume is the best troll in the world
[0:25:47] <%ElenaManetta> SHe BETTER SWIM BETTER
[0:25:49] <%JaydenSai> Wait that implies Elmo wasnt drowning? @AngriestPat
[0:25:50] <ScreamLord> Zorah's weapons look so good except for GS and Dual Blades. I hope their Master Rank versions are good
[0:25:51] <%dekkitout> No one outside of South America knows who Terry is sadly
[0:25:51] <Caidezes> Paige would drown in an instant.
[0:25:54] <%Venicilia> The real question, Can Paige swim?
[0:25:59] <%Sh00s> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:26:03] <jemerald0> You undertale nerds don’t actually get him with a legit moveset
[0:26:05] <flyingavocadosofdoom> Also Elmo won't drown you
[0:26:08] <Hiruzen93> but her lupis makes so she has a lower swim speed
[0:26:12] <butthurtdave> So have they announced the full monster list or are there still secret boys?
[0:26:13] <ArrogantPrimate> Pat's build has a very high buoyancy stat
[0:26:18] <%keyworthe> wait what
[0:26:19] <Valdorick> But Sans a Mii costume also makes sense. What would Sans in the game proper even be? Him just not getting hit but always being at 999% health?
[0:26:27] <%ThePuddingDead> sounds good
[0:26:30] <%keyworthe> why is pat playing it on the ps4?
[0:26:30] <%ThePuddingDead> hell yeah

[0:26:55] <+bobfriskit> I thought this came out in 4 monts?
[0:26:55] <%Venicilia> Seeing Sans as a costume and not a full character made me so happy. as a Touhou fan I get to shit on my friend who's an Undertale fan even harder now

[0:31:49] <%SoFarFetched> Thank you Matt Mercer for telling us
[0:31:53] <butthurtdave> I'M SO MAD that the Claw Counter on Lance is so garbage. You still get hit during its whole animation and can get hit with element blights too, so it feels like it's gonna be utter garbage in G
[0:31:55] <+yoshkosh20> @AngriestPat why are melons always getting married? cause they cantaloupe.
[0:31:57] <%fFailureatlife> temporal mantle was cheating anyway
[0:31:58] <+Jekado> i like the clutch claw updates for the SnS
[0:31:58] <OuijaTears> is it?!! :D
[0:31:59] <@commanderclaw> Hi Matt Mercer

[0:32:18] <+bobfriskit> ok
[0:32:25] <$Cobra743> Cheer100 so pat as a fellow mid maxer answer me this, did they finally add fucking glamour or whatever they call it to change my appearance in World? I want maximum stats but still look cool damn it. Also whats your rank in the 2nd season of nightwave in warframe?
[0:32:29] <%Zamorouskiwhich> I wonder if the Clutch Claw has a unique skin for using Dantes Gauntlet like the regular slinger gets ruuThink
[0:32:30] <%sjay449> GIVE ME A NERO LAYERED ARMOR! I NEED IT
[0:32:34] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Nero costume would be perfect for Clutch Claw
[0:32:34] <thebiganxiety> Why not go to the training area? It has an area specific for clutch claw
[0:32:36] <%primax104> ok Mr. Mercer
[0:32:42] <Frostydough1> this brings the devil closer to you so he can give you positive affirmations and tell you how much you matter larxaPat larxaPat larxaPat

[0:33:21] <Valdorick> Leave chungus alone!
[0:33:23] <framewindowcleaner> Does it stack with regular Hammer stun???
[0:33:24] <+Deebo305> Love the new jagras set
[0:33:26] <LaughingCatt> Is the Clutch Claw basically taking the place of a new weapon type this generation?
[0:33:26] <Zebroneath> This is a very nice tutorial
[0:33:27] <%fFailureatlife> lmao jagras
[0:33:28] <imquotin> monster hunter more like monster hunter
[0:33:28] <acexclover> any glaive users?
[0:33:31] <+Jekado> you can also lauch them with the clutch if you have ammo
[0:33:31] <%crowsloft77> That'll make Luna a bit easier
[0:33:31] <%SoFarFetched> Jagras gets bullied so much LUL
[0:33:31] <%dekkitout> Does clutch claw-ing contribute to mount thresholds

[0:34:06] <startstoprepeat> you can mount into clutch claw but i've still no idea why you would
[0:34:07] <+Verd_254> it increases weakness exploit %
[0:34:11] <%mrshazboto> Can't you now just spam TCS with the new clutch combo?
[0:34:19] <%ThePuddingDead> rocks no longer useless

[0:34:24] <%Neryl_> It seems OP.
[0:34:25] <%spiritofmojave> ah that's not a mount so much as like a way to down them
[0:34:30] <ProfessorLitmus> the Velkhana fight from the demo made you have to use the debuf clutch attack way too much
[0:34:33] <+Jekado> i hope they make more support skills
[0:34:36] <jinking79> shotgun slinger
[0:34:39] <darcfowler1995> glaive glaive is the best kind of feels like Dragoon
[0:34:44] <+Spice_bubble> poor jugro
[0:34:45] <%mrshazboto> Yeah - you can TCS into shooting rocks into TCS and keep doing it
[0:34:49] <+7gryphons> is that matt mercer's voice?
[0:34:50] <%SoFarFetched> I still need my dragoon armor NotLikeThis
[0:34:50] <butthurtdave> i'm gonna be so hesitant to use the clutch in G cuz that damage you take during it is no joke
[0:34:55] <%bevyrage> @spiritofmojave it's a trade-off of localized damage for speed, but otherwise operates the same as a mount would
[0:34:57] <vonmaultke> SnS life FeelsGoodMan come at me chat
[0:34:58] <Valdorick> Bitch rocks no longer useless? Thank god, I won't feel like a jackass when I pick up rocks when I already have crystal burst
[0:35:01] <overfiend_> je suis monte
[0:35:02] <@commanderclaw> Time for the Whiff stream
[0:35:04] <SirTeabottom> get a whiff of that shit
[0:35:07] <acexclover> @sofarfetched was a bitch to get!!
[0:35:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> Hammer is the worst weapon in Monster Hunter. And I can say that cause I liked using Dual Blades, which is the worst weapon in Monster Hunter.
[0:35:10] <+necroplasm> is this in pc yet?
[0:35:10] <%Agami23> time for mister whiffle pickle
[0:35:11] <pee_foam> I spent like an hour yesterday cutting max might out of all of my builds.
[0:35:11] <framewindowcleaner> So, stun builds are now even more broken, because you have another way to stagger monsters with the clutch claw.
[0:35:25] <+zaworldo> Just BULLY the jagras
[0:35:27] <%ihatepersona345> One day they will patch in the option to skip cutscenes
[0:35:28] <holydeviant1> Next update: So we've implemented training mechanics

[0:38:55] <%dirtyh4rr1> that's what she said
[0:38:57] <King_thunder365> Because of the girth?
[0:38:58] <%BubbaRands> that's what she said
[0:38:59] <chaos2frozen> Who's the pull out king then?
[0:39:00] <brambobelurkin> Lance ges a new parry
[0:39:00] <Valdorick> Pat will NEVER become a WoW streamer, guys.
[0:39:03] <%SoFarFetched> It's really playing it for the memories
[0:39:03] <%dekkitout> Is that what you're calling it now
[0:39:04] <TheFallingLotus> We can see him.
[0:39:04] <DanielisAwesome52> Take All is new for consoles
[0:39:05] <brambobelurkin> so you can parry AND parry
[0:39:08] <%Jeemukun> huh, i use the same armor, but dober arms instead of teo arms

[0:39:10] <fattyboy067> @rumtumtugnutz you're just mad cuz it's killing your shitty raiding simulator
[0:39:14] <%BubbaRands> Soff babby butt
[0:39:16] <ScreamLord> No it doesn't.
[0:39:16] <%FrostMass22> The greatsword is what Pat calls his penis
[0:39:18] <%Jeemukun> you using the skull mask pat?
[0:39:19] <%zeroarturia> @heldritch1 Pat got a review code. hence why he got it early.
[0:39:27] <%Venicilia> welp, gonna go take out the caca
[0:39:28] <framewindowcleaner> Ginger goblin human is too much into his garbage cat
[0:39:35] <DSD24> I love the Greatsword
[0:39:50] <%ihatepersona345> LEGIANA NotLikeThis DansGame
[0:39:56] <Strider222> LETS DO THIS
[0:39:58] <JaerHQ> insect glaive for life
[0:39:59] <rosemon5001> we better get dinner douchebag
[0:40:01] <%SoFarFetched> @AngriestPat it just helps you track monsters
[0:40:04] <Broand> je suis monte
[0:40:05] <Hiruzen93> hammer for life
[0:40:05] <vonmaultke> Did that guy just ask you out to dinner? Jebaited
[0:40:07] <%SoFarFetched> for riding monsters it just helps
[0:40:10] <butthurtdave> The riding monsters are autopilots that track and collect monster tracks for you
[0:40:13] <Valdorick> Legiana LUL
[0:40:17] <OhioNitsud> insect glaive is pretty fun
[0:40:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Fattyboy067 That's a bold assumption. I don't currently play any MMORPGS. I stopped playing WoW after Warlords because the game is garbage? Wow Classic is better, but it's still garbage? So Calm your tits fucko.
[0:40:19] <+Jekado> its just auto move while you juice up and sharpen
[0:40:19] <a_mad_dragon> you get on a monster and hold on, and when it moves you move too, that's what riding is
[0:40:26] <etalmeta> you get it in the new hub
[0:40:28] <Ner234> Is Pat gonna do all of Iceborne or is this a one off stream?
[0:40:31] <%SoFarFetched> You can also sharpen while riding
[0:40:33] <ShichiNoBushi> "Legionis"?
[0:40:33] <%king_wragles> OH, for a second I thought he was talking about mounting and I was like "holy shit dude"
[0:40:34] <Doodle_Taco> Man I hope Narga just shows up
[0:40:36] <ScreamLord> The Handler!? WutFace
[0:40:37] <Rygart121> are we able to skip cutscenes now ?
[0:40:43] <%Futurecity10> @Ner234 One off
[0:40:45] <DanielisAwesome52> Tail Rider Whistle is probably from your Palico later in the story
[0:40:48] <+Jekado> the uggo handler
[0:40:50] <IsaiahOmega> your palico unlocks it for you
[0:40:52] <%republicofu> can you change it to JP so you don't have to hear her voice
[0:40:53] <+Jekado> when can we hunt her?
[0:40:54] <Ner234> @Futurecity10 I see. Thanks
[0:40:56] <Rexenexus> Playing in Monster Hunter language makes the Handler barable
[0:40:57] <%fFailureatlife> THE HANDLER DID NOTHING WRONG
[0:40:58] <framewindowcleaner> I hate the Handler, despise that always talking idiot.
[0:40:59] <%alcors_wisdom> if the handlers here that means shes going to get attacked
[0:41:01] <ProfessorLitmus> riding the monster is so you can fast travel after monsters and craft at the same time
[0:41:01] <butthurtdave> @AngriestPat how many times do you think Handler is going to almost get killed by monsters in this expansion?
[0:41:04] <%sjay449> Stop bullying English handler chat
[0:41:06] <%SoFarFetched> All the time
[0:41:07] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @DanielisAwesome52 It's actually from all the cat tribes.
[0:41:08] <OhioNitsud> too quiet...
[0:41:09] <%king_wragles> @Jekado the deadliest game...
[0:41:14] <%dekkitout> Leave Handle-chan alone you bullies
[0:41:20] <%President_Miyazaki> Savage Deviljho immediately.
[0:41:21] <JaerHQ> the handler roflgatorSleep roflgatorSleep roflgatorSleep
[0:41:22] <Zebroneath> Gurl, we've been CULLING the monster population since then.
[0:41:23] <+Zteck123> Oh look, is it the handler being useless again?
[0:41:24] <+valkuma> Pat you can't stare at iceborne it's not out yet
[0:41:26] <+Jekado> Handler "we did it" Me "WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE?!?!"
[0:41:26] <%ihatepersona345> can't you mute her/
[0:41:30] <%Gogogolem> what exactly does the handler do?
[0:41:32] <Monkeyweed21> swing again
[0:41:33] <%spiritofmojave> do eet
[0:41:33] <+zaworldo> She's gonna die
[0:41:36] <pee_foam> we all do, pat
[0:41:38] <%sjay449> she HANDLES YOU
[0:41:38] <%king_wragles> @Gogogolem Yes.
[0:41:39] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat That's a good instinct tho
[0:41:39] <+zaworldo> isn't she
[0:41:39] <ArcOfDeath> i can only hope the handler doesnt go to iceborne area D:
[0:41:39] <%TheTakkster> Talk and eat
[0:41:40] <%nmaten> on console you cant mod the handler out of the game
[0:41:41] <Doodle_Taco> Nobody would ever know
[0:41:42] <JaerHQ> swing again
[0:41:42] <%zamzoph> @Gogogolem handle Kappa
[0:41:42] <framewindowcleaner> HEY HUNTER - LISTEN ! HELLO ! LISTEN !
[0:41:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> I really doubt that Pat is going to do a full playthrough of Iceborne. Doesn't seem like a great game for streaming a whole lot of.
[0:41:42] <Rygart121> KILL HER
[0:41:44] <%ihatepersona345> SHUT UP WOMAN
[0:41:44] <Monkeyweed21> she can die in the Deviljho quest
[0:41:47] <Dovakhin573> Dont bully the handler
[0:41:47] <+Jekado> @Gogogolem aggravates you
[0:41:48] <zv1neda> @angriestpat if you have the tailrider it'll let you ride monsters to scoutfly destinations in order to get the tail rider you'll need to be friends with those cats you get your palico gadgets from
[0:41:48] <42nfl19> Is pat starting the mission the the new iceborne world?
[0:41:48] <%spacehouse> Become as PAIGE
[0:41:50] <ProfessorLitmus> and .......Rajang out of nowhere!!!
[0:41:51] <SilverFaustX> u can turn off her voice
[0:41:58] <%kewlmyc> She sure does talk alot
[0:41:58] <%SoFarFetched> Spoiler: Handler will be the reason you do a lot of quests in Iceborne LUL
[0:41:59] <Rexenexus> please change her to monster hunter language it's unbarable
[0:42:00] <%zeroarturia> god just shut up Handler.
[0:42:01] <Zebroneath> This on PS$ Pro?
[0:42:02] <DraxTD> nice sword @AngriestPat
[0:42:03] <%BubbaRands> I've got a long investigation for ya...How long till they find your body.
[0:42:06] <Zebroneath> PS4*
[0:42:06] <DanielisAwesome52> @LORDSPOOKLEKINS But do you get the single Whistle item from your cat like in the Beta? or do u have to upgrade every tribes level?
[0:42:07] <%king_wragles> @Gogogolem serious answer, she's the quest counter for solo play.
[0:42:10] <rufus2k2> "You're ghostin' us, hunter. I don't care who you are back in monster hunter world, you give away our position one more time, I'll bleed ya, real quiet. "
[0:42:11] <%fFailureatlife> You guys are so mean
[0:42:15] <holydeviant1> MonHun Pat being like "God, I wish I could just swing this sword hard enough to launch this bitch to low orbit"
[0:42:27] <@commanderclaw> Did you max out the S Link?
[0:42:28] <firehawk_420> The handler is so annoying
[0:42:30] <Monkeyweed21> you need to become BESTIES with them
[0:42:31] <+Jekado> everytime i go back to camp and she's digging through my shit
[0:42:36] <Crazy_Jay10> wait, is iceborn out or did Pat get a Capcom handy?
[0:42:38] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @DanielisAwesome52 From what i know you have to level each one to get a whistle for each area.
[0:42:40] <DSD24> Pat when are you going to stream FF8 Remastered
[0:42:44] <%SoFarFetched> it be the special handy
[0:42:45] <%king_wragles> I hope she eats poison
[0:42:47] <ProfessorLitmus> higher rank for friendships can now be earned
[0:42:50] <Zebroneath> Pat got a handy
[0:42:50] <+Zteck123> Delete her system34
[0:42:51] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I've never had any technical issues with my PS4 Pro copy of MHW
[0:42:51] <%spiritofmojave> Tailrider will now DIE for you
[0:42:52] <Monkeyweed21> @Crazy_Jay10 Capcom Handu
[0:42:52] <+Jekado> she is poison
[0:42:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> The best character in this game is the Meowscular Chef.
[0:42:53] <zv1neda> @angriestpat you'll probably need to get s links with them
[0:42:53] <Crazy_Jay10> got it
[0:42:54] <wondersloth07> when does this streamer grill show feet

[0:43:01] <Zebroneath> LUL

[0:43:03] <%barkon345> @AngriestPat what happened I thought you were going to wait for the pc version of this game?
[0:43:10] <Rexenexus> tfw we'll never EVER get Moga Sweetheart ever again sugoiAwawa

[0:45:09] <%barkon345> so is this actually out right now or is this just an early copy? becasue I just got the update but my game is saying it wont let me play the expansion until tomorrow.
[0:45:09] <%Gogogolem> This expansion brought to you by Vanilla Ice
[0:45:09] <%spiritofmojave> they couldn't just scout that out with boats before this expansion
[0:45:11] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat How did the miss a giant ass ice island over the sea RIGHT THERE?
[0:45:11] <%miguelrod777> ita just an ice bridge
[0:45:12] <+Jekado> FOG OF WAR
[0:45:12] <mayorrev> do you think someone will say the phrase Iceborne
[0:45:13] <pee_foam> fire a flashpod and knock all of them into the ocean
[0:45:15] <Zebroneath> Ok, Sojiro
[0:45:16] <%fFailureatlife> spoilers it wasnt there the whole time
[0:45:16] <Unfriendlytimetraveler> Is it out or is he playing early
[0:45:18] <%sjay449> Sojiro give me coffee
[0:45:22] <DSD24> Commander and his Dragonator
[0:45:24] <%SoFarFetched> playing early
[0:45:25] <%Goobbue> @AngriestPat so how does the expansion story work? Is this like FFXIV where you have to complete the base game to do this?
[0:45:26] <zv1neda> the huntsman PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:45:28] <Valdorick> Maybe the entire island is an iceberg, and it only just floated here.
[0:45:30] <%Gogogolem> This man has the deepest voice
[0:45:31] <Endlesslyforgetful> papa nierrr
[0:45:37] <%dave323dave> nerd
[0:45:39] <Doodle_Taco> This guys sounds like an asshole
[0:45:40] <DSD24> Hello Wesker

[0:45:47] <%starotter70> WESKER!
[0:45:48] <+Zteck123> 1 hunter would decimate any dark souls boss tbh
[0:45:51] <+Jekado> cuz the master rank
[0:45:52] <%Starlight_Gamer> so they have never noticed this new land mass?
[0:45:53] <%dekkitout> "Unfortunately, my Dragonator is to heavy to mount to airships"
[0:45:55] <SilverFaustX> if u play mhw on ps4 install it on a ssd, wayy faster loading
[0:45:57] <%fFailureatlife> the huntsman is a longsword user like a true man of culture
[0:45:59] <Ether101_Prime> River City Girls is fun and the twist for the Steven Universe movie doesn't make sense.
[0:46:04] <%sjay449> @AngriestPat they give newbies superarmor to speed through vanilla
[0:46:07] <%nmaten> Gmaster Grank
[0:46:11] <Valdorick> Influencer Powers; ACTIVATE! So buy the game now, so you can get into Iceborne when it releases!
[0:46:12] <%KaironFortressKnight> Commander use Genesic Emerald Tager Buster plz
[0:46:13] <Rexenexus> G rank sounds cooler
[0:46:15] <SirTeabottom> but what does the G stand for?
[0:46:17] <sgtlaggy> cant wait for Master Master Rank
[0:46:17] <Doodle_Taco> G-Rank sounds better tho...
[0:46:22] <arkv01> god rank?
[0:46:26] <Monkeyweed21> usually the expansion is a new game that requires you to start over
[0:46:28] <+Jekado> gangster
[0:46:29] <butthurtdave> just G
[0:46:29] <%SoFarFetched> @sjay449 everyone actually gets that armor

[0:46:59] <+FOGSHIE> @AngriestPat You're a coward for not waiting until PC.
[0:47:00] <%Venicilia> Gundam, Gangsta, G-spot.... many good things that start with G
[0:47:01] <SaintSadistic> They explained it some time. It is literally "We choose G 'cause lots of positive words like good begin with it".
[0:47:01] <zenith0111> G-Unit
[0:47:01] <%superc37> EW, STUPID WEEBS
[0:47:03] <%Venicilia> wait
[0:47:04] <JaerHQ> DUB IS FOR LOSERS
[0:47:04] <Rexenexus> They literally called it G rank because of how the letter "G" sounds, it's just a cool letter
[0:47:04] <Valdorick> But English VA gives us Papa Nier!
[0:47:04] <IsaiahOmega> Great probably
[0:47:09] <Valdorick> The one true Nier
[0:47:10] <%Jeemukun> man, i've been using the japanese VAs since the start, this is weird to hear

[0:47:11] <%SoFarFetched> And Matt Mercer
[0:47:14] <Caidezes> G Rank should have been localized as Grand Rank.
[0:47:14] <+younger54> Goddamus
[0:47:14] <+Snohobeau> @AngriestPat you see those feet in the back... gross. Just thought you should know

[0:47:34] <+Jekado> should be a palico language option
[0:47:40] <Kingdom_65> Imagine not playing with Monster Hunter Language
[0:47:40] <%sjay449> It's Papa Nier/ Sojiro

[0:48:27] <DanielisAwesome52> @GarbageNirvana The movie is gonna be in a similar universe to World, meaning it'll be Master, if they bother mentioning ranking at all. (The Handler is a real character in the movie)
[0:48:28] <ScreamLord> "But I'm not bioluminescent!"
[0:48:29] <yourliteraldog> The more endangered the better

[0:49:48] <yeildingthought> I feel like I should delete all my old investigations
[0:49:51] <Monkeyweed21> its an uber
[0:49:54] <ScreamLord> @mayorrev Wyvern Ignition "Impact" you get it from an event quest and before Iceborne it was THE best GS
[0:49:57] <42nfl19> Uber
[0:49:59] <+Zteck123> so its just a vehicle summon
[0:50:02] <%RubberFistFight> I never got into this game.
[0:50:04] <+Jekado> yup
[0:50:04] <startstoprepeat> i think you might need to improve relations wish the local felyne groups or something
[0:50:04] <HUNTERX2X> well, time for max and pat to team up
[0:50:05] <mayorrev> ooooh
[0:50:09] <%President_Miyazaki> Yes but you also didn't have master rank until just now but the tutorial was still there.
[0:50:10] <IsaiahOmega> Talk to your cat
[0:50:10] <%Venicilia> That Jargras is FKN EXCITED YO
[0:50:11] <%RubberFistFight> I played it a bit and was like "eh, maybe it's not for me"
[0:50:11] <%BubbaRands> Monster Lyft
[0:50:11] <+Jekado> its just a "fast travel"
[0:50:11] <+ShadowForceX75> you have to have comnplete that areas palico mission
[0:50:24] <ravencloak13> Hell, the ******** could be the big final boss of a grown up Xenojiva.
[0:50:25] <Doodle_Taco> Man I just realized all the hours farming for Daora parts is useless
[0:50:26] <%starotter70> @RubberFistFight Same, makes me sad cause it seems cool
[0:50:27] <%RubberFistFight> Like, I didn't hate it, but I also wasn't really grabbed by anything in it.
[0:50:29] <+Jekado> why does his guy look like solid snake?
[0:50:32] <Monkeyweed21> no the new ones
[0:50:37] <arkv01> the feral ones?

[0:50:43] <carzeri> who? pat? yeah pat totally looks like solid snake
[0:50:44] <%spiritofmojave> they probably added some just hidden in the free exploration maps
[0:50:45] <+BoomerTiro> IS IT FINALLY HERE?
[0:50:46] <@commanderclaw> Didn't you learn you hadn't done the palico stuff during the Witcher stream?
[0:50:46] <Monkeyweed21> rank up your s-link
[0:50:47] <%mrshazboto> So is there anything stopping me from just hacking myself to the exact point i am on ps4 when i purchase iceborne for PC? How strict has the anti cheat on steam been about that?
[0:50:49] <ravencloak13> @jekado Why doesn’t yours?’
[0:50:53] <%SoFarFetched> @RubberFistFight that's fair,sometimes a very popular game just doesn't hit right for some people
[0:50:59] <%Agami23> did you get the moltov? @AngriestPat

[0:52:30] <ravencloak13> @jekado Filthy lies. Besides, you really shouldn’t be wearing armor going up against actual things like this, that’s why bowgun is the strongest. Cause that’s what you’d actually use to fight monsters not close range weapons.
[0:52:32] <Doodle_Taco> Boi he walikin'
[0:52:36] <zv1neda> @angriestpat you can sharpen your weapons and drink potions while on the monster

[1:15:27] <%worldbrand> i keep thinking he's saying chandler and i have to nod at that
[1:15:28] <%dekkitout> Handler: "Make me tajWINK "

[1:15:53] <OhioNitsud> *big lebowski meme*
[1:15:57] <%worldbrand> I dunno if I were fighting something and somebody was cheering "break its legs! break its legs!" i'd appreciate that
[1:15:58] <BrendenDK> Why hate handler?
[1:16:00] <+nogoodusernamesleft156> JUST DO IT. we love you
[1:16:01] <%Bane_Kaikyo> pat is not even chargeing his attacks.... That's why it's called a Charge Bla-- Oh wait...
[1:16:01] <Rshiners> pat please charge the true slash
[1:16:13] <%Mr_Strut> hot drinks
[1:16:13] <tyrano_the_wise> whos the real monster? D:
[1:16:16] <Valdorick> He screm
[1:16:17] <butthurtdave> I wish that they'd have updated the ticker to say what parts you broke
[1:16:17] <%dekkitout> A hip check that didn't have a bs hitbox- outlandish!
[1:16:19] <UchiVsTheWorld> you are such an angry baby
[1:16:19] <Tersalus> he's just got widdle wegs ;~;
[1:16:21] <Reanimator83> I’m guessing they didn’t add a mute function for your handler
[1:16:22] <%Shadowthedigger> DADDY PAT IS BUSY
[1:16:25] <%SoFarFetched> The handler is the real monster
[1:16:26] <mayorrev> that sounds dark out of context
[1:16:26] <+Okosisi89> @ravencloak13 thank the lord.
[1:16:27] <%GarbageNirvana> How many nights have I heard that
[1:16:33] <Valdorick> That's how modding should work.
[1:16:37] <yourliteraldog> I rember the last time I went hunting we made sure to break that deers legs
[1:16:37] <Rshiners> earn3ed
[1:16:41] <JaerHQ> handler new monster now kill
[1:16:42] <ravencloak13> See, in the olds games, that hip check would have hit him with your head,
[1:16:42] <Monkeyweed21> you picked it up
[1:16:43] <+BoomerTiro> Earned
[1:16:44] <+Jekado> do drops have light shafts now?
[1:16:47] <ravencloak13> Fuck PC.
[1:16:50] <%Bt_Robot> Does your greatsword not have the overhead cancel into sweeping attack infinite combo?
[1:16:54] <rideroftraps1> EXCEEPT TRANSMOG
[1:16:55] <tag545> picking up tracks sometimes give materials
[1:16:56] <+BoomerTiro> @Jekado They got sparklies
[1:16:56] <%republicofu> wheres all my bikini armor then
[1:17:07] <Zebroneath> Are monster material drops seen on the minimap?
[1:17:08] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> What about Pillars of Light ???
[1:17:08] <%bevyrage> oh my god the moose armor DOES have the big dumb antlers. also makes you look like a druidic viking!
[1:17:12] <ravencloak13> @republicofu You have to get them.
[1:17:17] <%Venicilia> The only thing that armor is missing is a Mosin or a PPS variant
[1:17:20] <%SoFarFetched> @Zebroneath only tails
[1:17:23] <Ted_the_red> it's also possible that they noticed they couldn't find the drops in the snow so they added the beams
[1:17:27] <+mister_rogers> what weapon is that
[1:17:30] <+Jekado> wonder what mods might transfer over
[1:17:31] <ProfessorLitmus> draw pepis in snow!
[1:17:32] <%Venicilia> the layered armor pat has i mean
[1:17:34] <UchiVsTheWorld> its like water
[1:17:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Wonder if I should be playing MHW myself to shake the rust off
[1:17:42] <+Jekado> i might have to uninstall them when IB comes out just in case
[1:17:42] <ravencloak13> Wait, could you guys seriously not find the drops?
[1:17:44] <%sileo_patronus> neat
[1:17:45] <Valdorick> Solid water shark.
[1:17:46] <ravencloak13> It was easy...
[1:17:47] <tyrano_the_wise> its like cooler, better lavasioth
[1:17:47] <Doodle_Taco> That snow looks so good
[1:17:48] <T_Sasquatch> Its just ice jyrutados
[1:17:54] <%spiritofmojave> same armor padding as Jyrutados/Barroth
[1:17:57] <+kraajkase> MonHun physics LUL
[1:18:01] <+BoomerTiro> The movement scales to snow depth
[1:18:10] <UchiVsTheWorld> in deep snow its like the knee deep water in other areas
[1:18:11] <OhioNitsud> does one of the monsters have a yellow snow attack?
[1:18:13] <%Futurecity10> How is this mother fucker not dead yet
[1:18:18] <+BoomerTiro> Ankle deep bearly slows you, wasit and chest high really slows you.
[1:18:18] <ravencloak13> @t_sasquatch Yeah with one new move, it does a spinning saw move ontop of the snow sideways.
[1:18:22] <@absolute_weapon> MR, Futurecity
[1:18:23] <%dekkitout> So is there any melt moss or whatever for the snow on it?
[1:18:26] <@absolute_weapon> these guys have a LOT of health
[1:18:27] <+Jekado> @ravencloak13 sometimes they would apear under the ground so i couldnt' see them without walk over also i have them color coded so i don't pick up wortheless stuff
[1:18:30] <zenith0111> @t_sasquatch And Nargacuga is just Tigrex
[1:18:39] <Tersalus> does it have a health bar?
[1:18:42] <tyrano_the_wise> i hope the armor of this guy makes you look like a street shark
[1:18:45] <+Brightstreak> yo Pat, just wanted to drop a piece of info about astral chain. if you do the unchained attack with your legion, you can call out a different legion while the first one is doing its thing. that's all, happy hunting dude!
[1:18:54] <UchiVsTheWorld> the fights last as long as they should now, in master rank. 15-20 minutes.
[1:18:57] <%SoFarFetched> @Tersalus not unless you had the mod for it LUL
[1:18:59] <+cunningchaff> Ugh, got this game for free on PC when I built mine, but I've got sooo much progress on PS4 it kills me to switch.
[1:19:02] <ravencloak13> But... all of this would be new so you’d need all of the new stuff...
[1:19:07] <+Deebo305> I wonder if screamer pods work on it
[1:19:08] <butthurtdave> The important question though: Do your palicos get layered armor?
[1:19:16] <%Bt_Robot> Do you have aquapods? It looks like it is covered in snow the same way other monster cover themselves in mud
[1:19:17] <ravencloak13> @deebo305 They do.
[1:19:30] <Reanimator83> Do you still have your armor under this winter gear or is this a new armor set?
[1:19:31] <+Deebo305> Good to know
[1:19:41] <ravencloak13> New armor set
[1:19:46] <yourliteraldog> Max ACT on that ice shark
[1:19:48] <Monkeyweed21> even better than mud
[1:19:49] <%Venicilia> @Reanimator83 thats a layered armor
[1:19:52] <%republicofu> this isn't great jagras
[1:19:52] <%Agami23> its layered armor you get at the start
[1:19:53] <tyrano_the_wise> looks rad too
[1:19:54] <ravencloak13> Also layered armor.
[1:19:54] <Doodle_Taco> The chad beo
[1:19:55] <%xsnowfox> lavasioth is such garbo
[1:19:56] <Tucker0603> fuck that lava bitch
[1:19:58] <%bevyrage> probably because you can ACTUALLY HAVE A FIGHT with this one
[1:20:01] <Reanimator83> Ok

[1:20:15] <%SoFarFetched> I think that's what they actually used for him
[1:20:16] <zenith0111> The snow physics look great
[1:20:18] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I am really tired
[1:20:19] <%dekkitout> Be sure not to camp his nest
[1:20:22] <+OkamiDude15> k3llyNAP quick nap

[1:20:42] <%bevyrage> nah it throws out a lot of hip checks, but it also has more moves to pick from
[1:20:46] <Arek_1> @AngriestPat Why no lvl 3 True Charged Slash?
[1:20:48] <ravencloak13> It’s just Jyrratotus so no.
[1:20:53] <%Maids4lyfe> snow shark
[1:20:53] <+Deebo305> Good job hunter
[1:20:55] <%bevyrage> like a barroth style headbutt and glavios style tail swipe
[1:21:08] <yourliteraldog> Max Act
[1:21:09] <tyrano_the_wise> now, how the fuck can it swim on snow?
[1:21:18] <%bevyrage> so the AI has a bigger pool to pull from 'stead of hip check hip check hip check spin spin hip check bite
[1:21:19] <tyrano_the_wise> i guess is not crazier than swiming on lava...
[1:21:23] <+OkamiDude15> dont worry abotut it
[1:21:29] <@absolute_weapon> Snow Sharks
[1:21:33] <Dapper_Cactuar> oh god, I completely forgot to farm armor spheres in the lead up to Iceborne evo19MindBlown

[1:42:03] <chad_irl> I only require the strongest potions
[1:42:04] <%panic_rabbit> you cannot handle my normal potions traveller, let alone my mega potions

[1:45:59] <GhostBrand> That shits so dumb and raaadddd!!
[1:46:00] <rubbishbinge> @ravencloak13 ye, pre-ordered he digital deluxe way back when. I was just confused since I couldn't find the legiana quest in the ancient forest

[1:46:24] <DanielisAwesome52> SO Beo gear is just recolored Lavasioth

[1:46:35] <%Typhaeon> Bae-otodus
[1:46:36] <%Venicilia> more boring samey Bone and Metal weapons? lame :c
[1:46:37] <bendatron> im assuming purple sharpness is a thing now
[1:46:42] <%sweenicus> so much sharpness
[1:46:42] <Tomschiii> @ravencloak13 you realise that the pc versoin is so much better than in the begining?
[1:46:47] <Doodle_Taco> I cant wait to see Rajang's weapons
[1:46:54] <+NecDW4> Man, between this and WoW Classic im not going to have enough time
[1:46:54] <Psyramics> yes, purple sharpness is a thing
[1:46:57] <+alphonseisbest> @angriestpat did they fix the weapons looking like crap problem yet?
[1:47:04] <+TheDeadpoolDash> Yeah I play the PC version too. I am but a lowly HR 14 though. Probably won't be getting to the expansion anytime soon.
[1:47:05] <butthurtdave> EXPERT WHAT
[1:47:06] <tag545> the skills suck but even the armor outclasses the maxed out high rank stuff right away
[1:47:12] <Psyramics> a gem you cant use
[1:47:12] <ravencloak13> That’s a lie, I still hear people complaining about it. Though that might be the crazies that want everything to be faster then light speed.
[1:47:14] <+nikoloas_> LEVEL 4 DECO
[1:47:16] <%dekkitout> Tier 4 deco
[1:47:18] <+Jekado> oh right level 4

[1:47:22] <tag545> lvl 4 deco
[1:47:22] <+talfurt> i wish they would have gone away from the generic weapon appearances with just a tiny bit of the monster glued on
[1:47:24] <%SoFarFetched> never trust crazies LUL
[1:47:24] <%Typhaeon> 4x hunters in all Rajang gear and weapons = Jang Gang

[1:47:42] <%goose_attack_almanac> At the end
[1:47:44] <ravencloak13> @sofarfetched But they make our better shit. Like the mad scientist do.

[1:48:42] <tag545> you get a bunch of decos but they are a random mix of skills
[1:48:45] <Valdorick> That's RAD

[1:49:21] <+AllenDeadman> or a first monster set it's alright
[1:49:22] <tag545> good for what?
[1:49:29] <%dekkitout> Beetle layered armor is still the best tho
[1:49:29] <+CookieCutter007> booooo alloy
[1:49:33] <ScreamLord> Speed Eating is lowkey OP
[1:49:35] <%BoboDaHobo> isn't handicraft coming from your charm?
[1:49:37] <%spiritofmojave> i'd say it's a little too slim to be the Bracha set
[1:49:38] <%segonian> I love the aloy set
[1:49:38] <ravencloak13> Wait, why does the thing effected by screamer pods have earplugs built in?
[1:49:38] <korean_random> still waiting for a good artillery set...
[1:49:41] <startstoprepeat> ice attack seems incredibly useful in this ice world where all the monsters are strong against ice
[1:49:43] <%republicofu> unupgraded
[1:49:44] <Tomschiii> @ravencloak13 well, not in the case of mhw
[1:49:50] <rubbishbinge> Jesus, that set is baller
[1:49:50] <%mrshazboto> Defense on master rank JAgras stuff is higher than fully upgraded Behemoth armor
[1:49:51] <ravencloak13> Your not wrong.
[1:49:58] <+Jekado> i hope they add the option to build entire sets
[1:50:04] <%Agami23> wait, did i see that right? does aqua affinity affect the snow???
[1:50:11] <%mrshazboto> Yes it does
[1:50:15] <Valdorick> Deco the Mantels!? 10/10

[1:50:21] <+CounterBeard> ohboy
[1:50:22] <%republicofu> lame
[1:50:22] <+Jekado> yeah
[1:50:23] <tyrano_the_wise> a helmet you can use to stab people is a good one in my book
[1:50:27] <%SoFarFetched> deco slots for mantles Kreygasm
[1:50:31] <+Jekado> that was announced a while back
[1:50:32] <Tomschiii> never understood the point of those npcs
[1:50:38] <TioXyco> thank god!
[1:50:38] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Everyone looks so good in their Winter Gear
[1:50:39] <%SoFarFetched> it's for slight flavor
[1:50:41] <%SoFarFetched> only slight

[2:10:14] <+Jekado> so the only SnS slinger update is the burst mode right?
[2:10:16] <%sweenicus> its milk is obviously in a bag
[2:10:17] <spardanwarrior> @Jekado Next level vigorwasp is essentially an extra cart. It heals you upon death
[2:10:17] <mayorrev> skunk?
[2:10:18] <valachi> @SoFarFetched Was it? I'm pretty sure the only way to see the armor was if you saw the leaks
[2:10:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> Man that badger didn't give a fuck
[2:10:22] <%TheTakkster> A wolverine, i bet
[2:10:24] <%ChaosAethr> Was that Ultra Mega Deer?!
[2:10:30] <$drbuttss> a wolverine
[2:10:35] <ravencloak13> @thetakkster More a snake wolf.
[2:10:36] <%SoFarFetched> @valachi well I mean with how leaks are show a lot these days.

[2:11:45] <arkv01> OOPMH thats a good one
[2:11:48] <tyrano_the_wise> is it just me, or there are one too many brute wyverns on MHW? i guess at the very least they are cool
[2:11:48] <ravencloak13> Oh! His nose horn up!
[2:11:53] <@lewdskeletor13> Are these monsters a threat to society or so we just hunt them for fun

[2:11:59] <+Estuko> @SoFarFetched suddenly I'm dumb child again
[2:12:00] <%sileo_patronus> If that tail doesn't come of I'll eat the local hat store
[2:12:00] <ravencloak13> Eat it for sexual prowess!
[2:12:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @lewdskeletor13 yes
[2:12:06] <%bevyrage> @tyrano_the_wise brute wyverns are one of the best monster types you take that back
[2:12:08] <%TheTakkster> @lewdskeletor13 both
[2:12:09] <@lewdskeletor13> Kappa
[2:12:10] <+Jekado> is this what a daily Canadian commute is like?
[2:12:10] <%SoFarFetched> LUL
[2:12:19] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Hey Pat! Try the strong shot combo, it’s charged slash, slinger shot, true charged slash
[2:12:21] <%shockzndrawe> p much
[2:12:22] <spardanwarrior> @Jekado Every gadget gets a new feature. IIRC there's a land mine for the flashbug.
[2:12:26] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat how are these guys communicating with you btw
[2:12:31] <mayorrev> telekenesis?
[2:12:35] <%TheTakkster> I think the monsters are all supposed to be bio engineered super weapons from a bygone age
[2:12:37] <+Jekado> must fight moose to get to work
[2:12:37] <Teyaric> is the weapon supposed to look that frosted over?
[2:12:42] <%TheTakkster> So they fuck up the ecosystem
[2:12:43] <ravencloak13> Your thinking telepathy.
[2:12:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Real mooses don't run
[2:12:44] <%sileo_patronus> @mayorrev shhhhh
[2:12:49] <ravencloak13> And sure.
[2:12:50] <mayorrev> i wanna know tho!!

[2:12:55] <Doodle_Taco> Get fucked Beo
[2:13:00] <%Svanyr> Gross, skidmarks
[2:13:05] <valachi> It's a shame how lame Beotodus is
[2:13:05] <%MisterTylerrr> The reason Pat needs so much redbull on the podcat is cause he uses all of his energy to fight the legendary moose
[2:13:09] <tyrano_the_wise> @bevyrage but leviathans tho :(
[2:13:26] <+zuxen> I'm not the only one that thinks bayonetta when he says beo right?
[2:13:33] <ravencloak13> CUTITSFUCKINGTAILOFF!
[2:13:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @zuxen nope
[2:13:40] <Valdorick> You are not, no
[2:13:41] <+Estuko> @TheTakkster kinda. There was a huge ancient civilization that was wiped out and stuff like that.
[2:14:02] <%garagon31> Dear Pat, the Code Vein character creator has tiny hats.
[2:14:02] <+Jekado> @zuxen i do
[2:14:02] <+Estuko> @TheTakkster I'm waiting for my Artian X armour set, an example of that past civilization tech from MH4U that I think is hella sexy.
[2:14:06] <%bevyrage> leviathans would be less cool if we had too many of 'em
[2:14:08] <%TheTakkster> It's all pretty vague, and ultimatly unimportsnt
[2:14:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> Attempt?
[2:14:12] <%TheSaintJohn> crazy talk
[2:14:13] <dipstere> LUL

[2:14:25] <Doodle_Taco> He's got personality
[2:14:26] <ravencloak13> Some are just normal monsters that were justmade.
[2:14:27] <Teyaric> I do not approve of that turning speed with his ball tho - that slide was super not real
[2:14:34] <$realm_forge> Finish it before it hits you with a hot jet of maple syrup!
[2:14:38] <%BoboDaHobo> he's the lagombi barroth
[2:14:41] <%Typhaeon> He's a beaver moose. Twice as Canadian!
[2:14:44] <tyrano_the_wise> i have to say, im a fan of dinosaur looking mamals, or viceversa
[2:14:48] <%TheTakkster> Man Albertosaurus looked way differant in my schoolbooks

[2:14:53] <mayorrev> I cannot wait to see what armor set you can get from this fuckin moose
[2:14:56] <%MisterTylerrr> @Teyaric Wait till you fight Tokyo Drift Tigrex
[2:15:07] <+Estuko> @tyrano_the_wise Monster Hunter is the way to go
[2:15:09] <ravencloak13> Your thinking of the Equal Dragon Weapon. Made from the corpses of multiple different monsters to become an undead killing machine fueled by killing.
[2:15:25] <Valdorick> Tail HP too stronk
[2:15:36] <mossypebble222> thats a thicc tail

[2:16:15] <+Estuko> @spardanwarrior LUL remember everyone freaking out when MHGU showed the final boss in a preview trailer
[2:16:15] <+Jekado> palicos' are pretty sturdy
[2:16:20] <%Typhaeon> je suis Monte!

[2:17:09] <@lewdskeletor13> Rip off that tail as a trophy
[2:17:14] <Lady_M91> Problem is his weapon, it's great for the base game, low tier garbage in Master Rank.
[2:17:15] <%TheTakkster> Tobigadachi or whatever frustrated me with his long, uncuttable tail
[2:17:17] <+mechslayer71> It can be cut off, I did it in the beta @angriestpat
[2:17:20] <+Taglog7> Longer the slice...ier
[2:17:20] <tag545> you can cut off the tip
[2:17:22] <+Estuko> @ravencloak13 aggressive sexual advances won't work on him
[2:17:26] <@lewdskeletor13> Pin it to the mountain as a warning to the other monsters
[2:17:27] <%SoFarFetched> oh yeah tobi's too can't be severed

[2:18:47] <tyrano_the_wise> i kinda feel sorry, but fuck it, the armor is cool
[2:18:47] <%TheTakkster> Foreskin is key to crafting the headgear
[2:18:47] <+Jekado> must be my ocd but skipping tracks bothers me
[2:18:49] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Throw away thorns, pick up stones?
[2:18:52] <ravencloak13> And take it’s nose horn for sexual prowess!
[2:19:02] <%XzileGaming> lost my harry
[2:19:03] <+Jekado> you can call an uber there pat
[2:19:04] <spardanwarrior> Seeing those Popo makes me miss Gammoth.
[2:19:12] <pee_foam> why are the numbers so small.
[2:19:21] <ravencloak13> Well, we got Galvinus so we might get Gammoth.
[2:19:25] <+Jekado> go for horns?
[2:19:29] <ravencloak13> And the other 2 of the fated 4
[2:19:29] <Zebroneath> Stamina increasing sounds more viable now
[2:19:30] <valachi> Gammoth sucks though
[2:19:32] <%bevyrage> @spardanwarrior apatGib
[2:19:33] <tag545> soften parts for huge numbers
[2:19:38] <pee_foam> horns are broke already
[2:19:40] <valachi> Gimmie Mizutsune or the lightning dragon
[2:19:45] <+DRAGKUDO> that's not nice pat. you'll hurt his feelings
[2:19:45] <yourliteraldog> You need to dry it's foreskin for a tincture that increases the size of your gonads
[2:19:46] <butthurtdave> jeez this boy has a lot of health
[2:19:50] <Valdorick> Any part of this fuck not broken?
[2:19:51] <ravencloak13> Mama Gammoth is good! Shut your heathen mouth!
[2:19:52] <%Venicilia> Mizutsune is my absolute favourites Monster, and armor
[2:19:54] <+Jekado> it is MR after all
[2:19:56] <Valdorick> Aside from its body and spirit
[2:19:59] <mayorrev> that sliced up tail is giving me goosebumps
[2:20:00] <ashuckel> You can use the clutch claw when a monster is moving to another area to go with it
[2:20:00] <+Jekado> i assume they have mexi health
[2:20:04] <+GalacticaPhanto> god I wish we had Mitsuzune

[2:20:35] <+Jekado> oh yeah he's skulling
[2:20:42] <+DRAGKUDO> whoever is drained of stamina is the loser
[2:20:43] <%Venicilia> you kno what would be a good new monster just to fuck with the newer players tho? Nibbelsnarf

[2:21:32] <+Jekado> weird yeah he slept near pat
[2:21:37] <+sam_groove> @AngriestPat Why don't you give your cat either a paralysis or sleep weapon?
[2:21:43] <%Laecerelius> Canada has been contained
[2:21:48] <%dekkitout> We takin' you home, moose-boi
[2:21:50] <+AlphaAgito> Ooooh thats a new quest clear theme
[2:21:55] <%Maids4lyfe> thicc bone
[2:21:59] <yourliteraldog> Do you get more if you dont kill it?
[2:21:59] <%SGrim> Paige, no
[2:22:02] <ravencloak13> Congratulations, you captured your nations God. Like Pokémon.
[2:22:06] <spardanwarrior> @doc_ock_rokc Sand fish. Not shark, fish.
[2:22:09] <+mechslayer71> Does dlc not unlock until midnight EST? I’m still locked out
[2:22:10] <ravencloak13> @yourliteraldog Yes.
[2:22:10] <@commanderclaw> Oh no, you have summoned Paige, she wants the thicc bone
[2:22:12] <Finakala> The convoy is now safe! Ignoring snow-knife Jyuratodus still swimming about
[2:22:12] <%Maids4lyfe> @yourliteraldog yes
[2:22:14] <pee_foam> pat hoisting his thick bone on stream
[2:22:14] <+Estuko> @aliasz50 which part? The QoL? Monster count? Variants? gotta be specifics lol
[2:22:15] <%TheTakkster> That thing was nearly out of shit to wreck
[2:22:17] <%SoFarFetched> capturing it gets you certain things everytime,killing it is more of a dice roll.
[2:22:17] <aliasz50> why else misses the gathering sound effect ?
[2:22:27] <ravencloak13> @finakala Eh,it’s a bitch.
[2:22:30] <tag545> finally escaped the demo... at least until tigrex
[2:22:35] <%XzileGaming> they ALL say VERY RARE Banbaro material
[2:22:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> You can only get some items from capturing it but you can get more rare items from a kill
[2:22:42] <arkv01> this nostalgic music ahhh
[2:22:47] <+Jekado> killing if you want a specific area for rolls, capture if you want more rolls i think
[2:22:49] <+Jekado> i could be wrong
[2:22:56] <%bevyrage> the capture/carve pools are usually slightly different. most monsters require one cap or carve to get a reliable chance at grabbing all of their drops
[2:23:07] <%TheTakkster> Some loot is exclusive to captures, and some exclusive to kills
[2:23:10] <tag545> in world. cap was made universally better

[2:39:22] <+BillyWimblett> KEEP GOING
[2:39:22] <tyrano_the_wise> ???
[2:39:24] <tag545> you feed points into the minigame to get stuff. if you do well you get extra stuff but you can just brute force it with enough points
[2:39:24] <ScreamLord> @tyrano_the_wise It's a steam engine. Of course it's not safe

[2:44:45] <$twitchyal> @cheer400 @AngriestPat I just want to say thank you again for all the years of content and my love for games and passion for life have been fueled by your group's efforts. Some days are tough and having someone there just wanting to chill and play hype ass shit gets me through the shit times.
[2:44:48] <+AlphaAgito> If only gunlance had a guardpoint
[2:44:48] <+Jekado> because vikings use to eat mushrooms for effects right?
[2:44:48] <%ThePuddingDead> lancer set
[2:44:49] <ammobasket> diggin
[2:44:52] <Mister_McDerp> moose like mushrooms
[2:44:54] <%Cthulos> That wassn't intended but sure
[2:44:55] <%SGrim> That is aggressively for lance mains
[2:44:57] <Saltmeisterr> this game has vanity armor right?
[2:45:00] <%ThePuddingDead> using not great sword
[2:45:02] <%ihatepersona345> The cool badass Viking set
[2:45:03] <tag545> they are hellbent on making the gear questionable. almost every piece of gear has random useless skills
[2:45:03] <Tisaric> jesus +4 attack
[2:45:04] <daedri> God damn.
[2:45:06] <+AllenDeadman> damn
[2:45:07] <ravencloak13> Oh, all monster sets now give bonuses to other types of skills that make it over the normal limit, like Brachigyos gives more levels to the agitator skill.
[2:45:09] <Psyramics> holy shit Jagras
[2:45:09] <Tucker0603> banbaro looks good for my charge blade style
[2:45:10] <%Mythicalbrit> yea didnt vikings eat shrooms to be berzerkers?

[2:45:26] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat MR Jagras set is really good
[2:45:31] <%mrshazboto> There's a way to get health boost and max attack with the set Arekzz posted
[2:45:36] <%Gogogolem> @Mythicalbrit They had an early form of Pcp for beserakers
[2:45:37] <roflwaffleauthoritah> can't believe they took away the plague doctor mask
[2:45:37] <tag545> blast is great. 300 damage per proc in master
[2:45:38] <%dekkitout> All these sets are pretty good
[2:45:44] <ravencloak13> @valdorick Jagars did the most raw number damage though.
[2:45:47] <%Sovspot> did they revamp the armor styles?
[2:45:48] <$realm_forge> BE A BIG VIKING MAN

[2:45:50] <$twitchyal> cheer400 @AngriestPat I just want to say thank you again for all the years of content and my love for games and passion for life have been fueled by your group's efforts.

[2:46:06] <Valdorick> @ravencloak13 As an IG user, Jagras always just made me sad.

[2:47:48] <GhostBrand> can we see what some of the other weapons look like?
[2:47:56] <+Nomenanza> you can just go on MR expeditions and farm em that way
[2:48:02] <ScreamLord> Jagras is to powerful to have right away
[2:48:03] <sgtlaggy> jagras is final boss of iceborne
[2:48:04] <%SoFarFetched> It's because you wishlisted it they don't want you getting it
[2:48:06] <valachi> Most of the weapons only get unique models at the end of their tree
[2:48:06] <@lewdskeletor13> @twitchyal Thanks for stopping by
[2:48:07] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat exposing himself to Framerate Hell because he is impatient and knows that he lost the bet. apatWhat

[2:48:26] <%goose_attack_almanac> It's too cute
[2:48:26] <valachi> So since Pat doesn't have the ability to see the end of the Jagras tree he can't see if it has a unique monster weapon
[2:48:31] <Sauceboss15> JAGERS

[2:51:08] <ScreamLord> @Rexenexus We'll find out if one of the NPC says it
[2:51:14] <startstoprepeat> it's worth mentioning that elemental got buffs pretty much across the board so raw isn't necessarily the be all and end all anymore
[2:51:16] <%PanicSwytch> so iceborne is available now? i thought it was at midnight.
[2:51:27] <%SGrim> brb
[2:51:27] <@absolute_weapon> Pat has early code
[2:51:30] <thenumberj42> streamer privilege
[2:51:39] <+mattymcfilth> @angriestpat does this essentially work like an mmo or nah?
[2:51:39] <%PanicSwytch> thanx
[2:51:40] <asurite_warrior> @AngriestPat How does it feel to be able to summon around 1000 people are any given time pat?
[2:51:41] <Doodle_Taco> There is a tigrex gunlance that is so GOOD
[2:51:47] <bashful_bard> Level 6 element skill is pretty strong
[2:51:47] <%FluffiTamamo> My shit is still halfway thru downloading. I’m really feeling the salt right now...

[2:52:24] <%spiritofmojave> all those attack ups and fast eating is quite the love
[2:52:25] <mossypebble222> OOH I WONDER IF THERE WILL BE ANY INVADERS
[2:52:31] <%PanicSwytch> Does every monster have a gamma armor?
[2:52:31] <+grim_abel> JAGRAS BAD
[2:52:35] <Valdorick> His set will be AMAZING... for the first 2 hours of the game Kappa
[2:52:37] <%Sovspot> He's a garbage monster that only lives to be bullied by hunters or deviljho
[2:52:41] <theloverobot> Looks hot in those furs
[2:52:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> Mr.GJ the greatest teacher of monster hunter
[2:52:51] <%Venicilia> Speaking of berets, my trade corps in the army RCEME, has a Kirin as our insignia. So I have a Kirin on my beret
[2:52:54] <Doodle_Taco> Please let me see a Narga
[2:53:05] <+Nomenanza> Nargacuga felt so good in beta

[2:53:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> ????
[2:53:31] <+Jekado> whats he doing?
[2:53:34] <Doodle_Taco> COWARD
[2:53:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> new cutscene?
[2:53:43] <%Scrub_Seeker> i think tagging a jagras so the quest to hunt it unlocks
[2:53:44] <bashful_bard> Unlocking the quest
[2:53:44] <%ThePuddingDead> i thin he's getting research points
[2:53:45] <Finakala> How the hell did you get a cutscene
[2:53:48] <+Jekado> is that for triggering inventigations
[2:53:48] <%ThePuddingDead> by finding him
[2:53:49] <Axonn1018> Pat confirmed scared of Great Jagras
[2:53:52] <tag545> people are making it through with high rank drac so jagras armor should last defensively at least
[2:53:53] <Sauceboss15> big big COWARD
[2:53:55] <+kuervojones> Should I switch to switch axe? Currently using longsword?
[2:54:04] <Doodle_Taco> @scrub_seeker shhhhh....just call him a coward
[2:54:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> Greatest Jager
[2:54:14] <+Jekado> it takes a big couragous hero to be a super coward
[2:54:15] <%SoFarFetched> isn't it you have to kill it to make it show up?
[2:54:15] <KingZaffy> You might need to actually take it down/capture it.
[2:54:18] <mossypebble222> try catching it
[2:54:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat has the moves like jagras
[2:54:23] <+Nomenanza> You wanna unlock the optional to do it with people?
[2:54:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> Capture him
[2:54:28] <BlueSpartan119> I believe you have to talk to the melder for it
[2:54:31] <%spiritofmojave> capture x number times?
[2:54:32] <%Scrub_Seeker> welp looks like you gotta go expedition kill him
[2:54:35] <tag545> just cap it. the previous missions were expeditions anyway
[2:54:40] <ScreamLord> No @AngriestPat, you have to catch it
[2:54:43] <%Cthulos> footprints?
[2:54:49] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Melder sends you to hunt them right?
[2:54:50] <kinmonon> pat comfirmed weak to jagras
[2:55:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> jager has the moves
[2:55:20] <+Jekado> if you kill someting on expedition it will rotate you
[2:55:20] <Doodle_Taco> Jagras elder dragon tier confirmed
[2:55:24] <tyrano_the_wise> heading off, had a blast. Have a good one
[2:55:31] <+Nomenanza> Hunts in MR so far take a lot of time
[2:55:31] <+Jekado> you can stay in a expedition indfeinately hunting i think
[2:55:38] <ScreamLord> I can't believe you ranaway from Great Jagras like a bitch
[2:55:43] <Doodle_Taco> John Jagras
[2:55:44] <Valdorick> Even the greatest Jagras was just a punk bitch only good for decos.
[2:55:55] <ScreamLord> You'll never get him now
[2:55:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Doodle_Taco did you ever see the Jagaras mod that made it like he ate a xeno part and he is burning up on the inside

[2:58:47] <%PanicSwytch> @doc_ock_rokc sorry to hear that lol
[2:58:49] <%ThePuddingDead> think its sabretooth kitty next?
[2:58:58] <%spiritofmojave> no that's the next conspicuous rock wall, which Tigrex will pop out of
[2:59:00] <%FluffiTamamo> How long before Handler gets in the way of another fight?
[2:59:00] <tag545> not yet
[2:59:02] <CuriousArtPhox> is the Ignition Impact not good anymore?
[2:59:02] <%SoFarFetched> That's what she said
[2:59:04] <ScreamLord> Thicc Bone
[2:59:06] <$realm_forge> nah handler likes to see the jaws of death before she rushes into them
[2:59:06] <CuriousArtPhox> been out of MHW for a while
[2:59:11] <+Nomenanza> Handler on expeditions is like a debuff
[2:59:15] <valachi> No it's a High Rank weapon
[2:59:19] <butthurtdave> T I G G E R
[2:59:19] <valachi> We're in G Rank now
[2:59:22] <DanielisAwesome52> Its good you like it, that what the rest of the BOne Greatsowrds will look exactly like
[2:59:24] <%zamzoph> I hope it's not a monster
[2:59:29] <AmericanaRed> WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace
[2:59:32] <Rexenexus> come oooooon Barioth

[2:59:37] <a_mad_dragon> KomodoHype
[2:59:39] <+Jekado> Master rank not "G" rank...
[2:59:40] <tag545> still on beginner monsters. no alphas for a bit
[2:59:49] <danknugglit> Is something moving? LET ME CLIMB IN ITS MOUTH
[2:59:53] <valachi> @Jekado It's G Rank, there's no difference
[2:59:56] <%spiritofmojave> G rank should assign the Serious Handler instead
[2:59:58] <+Jekado> i know

[3:00:13] <+Jekado> i think they called it MR for new people
[3:00:15] <+Jekado> i assume
[3:00:19] <oruandrew> KENSHIRO
[3:00:23] <Rexenexus> I'll never call it Master Rank, G rank sounds way cooler, my boomer brain won't let me say these new hip names
[3:00:25] <tag545> below. the third pocket
[3:00:31] <butthurtdave> If the third quest of the dlc is tigger, that's hardcore lmao

[3:00:55] <Zombrocom> As someone who came in on world, I don't see how G Rank sounds cooler than Master Rank
[3:00:56] <%dekkitout> I'm sure they'll add giggs and khez
[3:00:57] <valachi> Gigginox is literally never coming back, Pat
[3:01:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hinterlands?
[3:01:07] <Xiangchang> Is this the Senpai Rank mode I keep hearing about-

[3:11:32] <Mister_McDerp> COWARDICE
[3:11:36] <+yoshkosh20> you kill that big t-rex thing you'd have plenty of steaks
[3:11:38] <Arek_1> This was an Investigation, so no camp freebies.
[3:11:41] <%dekkitout> This is why I always make rations when at base
[3:11:41] <ravencloak13> Just eat!
[3:11:43] <+Jekado> preping what sorta coward talk is that
[3:11:49] <+lucaflow> Master hunter, doesn't prep
[3:11:52] <%Starlight_Gamer> what a cute panda
[3:11:53] <zakaraz> you swapped your loadout which removes hunt related items
[3:11:59] <Mortal_Wombat_I> ALWAYS bring rations
[3:12:02] <valachi> Why do you have all of those useless items and refuse to use your frigging radial menu
[3:12:05] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Or well done steaks
[3:12:07] <thenumberj42> real hunters only use what they find in the wild
[3:12:08] <%spiritofmojave> and no one ate steak that night
[3:12:09] <jon651> He's not going to fight Fulgar guys. He'd get wrecked
[3:12:11] <+Jekado> its called G rank not prepared rank
[3:12:13] <Arek_1> Err, Expedition*. No camp freebies for Expeditions.
[3:12:19] <ravencloak13> What was that circle thing?
[3:12:27] <kinmonon> COLD DRINKS IS USELESS
[3:12:28] <Clyderso> OG Rank KevinTurtle

[3:12:48] <+Jekado> screamer pods?
[3:12:48] <ravencloak13> What’s survivor set do”
[3:12:49] <%ThePuddingDead> stop reading
[3:12:51] <%SoFarFetched> pat's gotta hoard EVERYTHING
[3:12:53] <%FluffiTamamo> Your item bar is giving me hives
[3:12:55] <%aeravon> useless in that you arent using them despite them helping you. demon and armorksin drugs
[3:12:59] <%ThePuddingDead> stop reading tho
[3:13:01] <%dekkitout> I mean, cold drinks are useless till we hit an elder dragon or glavenus
[3:13:02] <%mrshazboto> This is literally his trash file - no reason to optimize loadouts
[3:13:02] <%worldbrand> yeah guys what if he needs them later
[3:13:02] <+Jekado> make a layout for every setting
[3:13:12] <bendatron> so transmog is a thing i guess
[3:13:12] <+Jekado> then port back?
[3:13:14] <kinmonon> if you play using radial menu its ok
[3:13:15] <%ThePuddingDead> why not make another item set
[3:13:16] <%Bane_Kaikyo> thats fuckin stoopid Pat
[3:13:21] <+soopahtoast> I do the same in gen u
[3:13:28] <+lucaflow> So you'll bring both drinks but you forget the steak?

[3:25:59] <+JavaManJoJo> @Bane_Kaikyo There's sort of a big circle jerk about hating the handler. I think it's like, half genuine half memes. But it depends on the person. I like her well enough for what it's worth.

[3:28:15] <%ThePuddingDead> with handler gone he meant
[3:28:16] <+zaworldo> the handler is G O N E
[3:28:17] <%reonome> because handler is gone LUL
[3:28:20] <JaerHQ> I feel at peace now
[3:28:24] <Valdorick> This outpost is now the B-team holdout. Only losers get stationed here.
[3:28:25] <Rosy_Joan> everyone hoes mad for and against Handler
[3:28:25] <%Bane_Kaikyo> oh fuck off
[3:28:28] <+JavaManJoJo> @Bane_Kaikyo Yeah I don't understand the extent of the vitriol but I've seen it elsewhere too. Kinda toxic sometimes imo, but it's not a big deal I guess.
[3:28:30] <$realm_forge> Now that handler is gone
[3:28:35] <+Jekado> just the loadouts
[3:28:36] <Valdorick> REMOVE COLD DRINK
[3:28:39] <+soopahtoast> everything
[3:28:41] <%Nobrev> USE RADIAL
[3:28:42] <Wobuzhidao> people are just annoyed you don't use radials
[3:28:44] <%mrshazboto> Do you NOT just have a item loadout for each monster?
[3:28:45] <thenumberj42> KEEP COLD DRINK
[3:28:45] <%SoFarFetched> but he might NEED cold drink
[3:28:45] <+AllenDeadman> people just being dumb about cool drinks
[3:28:46] <$realm_forge> It’s like a pet parrot that finally fell asleep
[3:28:48] <+Jekado> because its like how you said the wooly to have multi load outs
[3:28:48] <%Ninestempest> YEAH IM SUR EYOU NEED FUCKING COLD DRINK
[3:28:49] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Radial menu is useful
[3:28:49] <$i_am_therydon> imagine the spring outfit on new handler
[3:28:52] <+kraajkase> Handler who?
[3:28:52] <%ihatepersona345> people hate her cause she always needs saving and never shuts up
[3:28:53] <+Zereaux> ITS FINE
[3:28:54] <ravencloak13> ...why they bring back the new sub species monster with use?
[3:28:58] <%ThePuddingDead> u really shouldnt have so many items, make new item sets for different situations, it makes thing easier @AngriestPat
[3:28:58] <%dekkitout> Someone was talking about how you had an all round item loadout
[3:29:00] <TheHotStuven> Only the screamer pods are kinda not needed for like 90% of hunts
[3:29:01] <Psyramics> one is for crafting
[3:29:02] <+Jekado> just the one load out is inefficient
[3:29:03] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat they're acting like you're gathering with that item set
[3:29:04] <Rexenexus> One is to craft
[3:29:06] <bashful_bard> For crafting more
[3:29:06] <%Svanyr> make and use i assume
[3:29:07] <%SoFarFetched> should fix that.
[3:29:07] <BlueSpartan119> craft flashpod, but they canged that now
[3:29:08] <%dekkitout> EZ flash pods
[3:29:09] <%aeravon> If you bring Demondrug and Armorskin, use them
[3:29:09] <+Jekado> one is craft
[3:29:11] <T_Sasquatch> EZ
[3:29:12] <+Estuko> @JavaManJoJo It's funny imo, I don't REALLY have a burning hatred, I'm justn ot too into her myself. I liked Guildmarm
[3:29:16] <MadDesperado13> she's rob Schneider'
[3:29:29] <%Anime_Flux> poopie pod
[3:29:33] <+rohgaun> YOUR the poop one
[3:29:39] <ScreamLord> Shit Stain Pods
[3:29:40] <%SoFarFetched> Well it's fun until people take it too seriously,like with alll jokes LUL
[3:29:41] <AmericanaRed> so meaty
[3:29:42] <+Jekado> also why don't you pop armor skin and demon drug on start
[3:29:43] <T_Sasquatch> Hating on her is also fun tbh, even though i do dislike her
[3:29:50] <butthurtdave> Has Pat done any emotes? Palicos copy you when you do them now
[3:29:50] <ravencloak13> @sofarfetched It never was.
[3:29:50] <+Jekado> it last til end of cart of missions
[3:29:52] <%valhallangiant> valhallangiant subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:29:54] <Echo_Dom> what
[3:29:59] <+Zereaux> ALSO vanilla handler is fine
[3:30:05] <+soopahtoast> it was you, you were the poopies pod ALL ALONG
[3:30:13] <ravencloak13> I just hear people and just hear “I hate myself”.
[3:30:15] <BlueSpartan119> MonHun Snap
[3:30:18] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Pat you don't need pods if you find them in the wild, no need to carry honey and drugs unless you are really bucckling down on big game
[3:30:18] <%mrvidicus> Sup guys, am I on time for the God of War 2018 stream?
[3:30:24] <Valdorick> Food handler is fine - she's like food, and that already makes her top tier.
[3:30:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> This just in Handler was found dead with a greatsword in her back...deemed suicide
[3:30:30] <reddpop_> Guildmarm > Handler
[3:30:31] <Echo_Dom> WHAT
[3:30:34] <%Rngiddion> time for bully
[3:30:40] <BlueSpartan119> HE'S BACK
[3:30:45] <%VanaSkiller> she doesn't call me Doodle tho
[3:30:46] <+Jekado> screamer pods seem a bit unessary until you fight diablos i feel
[3:30:49] <+soopahtoast> @reddpop_ thank you
[3:30:54] <+JavaManJoJo> @Estuko Yeah in an earlier comment I explained that it's like half memes for some people, but Twitch chat isn't great for convos lol. I like Handler fine. Guildmarm is bae.
[3:30:55] <JaerHQ> @doc_ock_rokc HA
[3:30:58] <+Estuko> @doc_ock_rokc FUCK, that reminded me of that damn ... Adoring Fan from ES Oblivion LUL LUL LUL

[3:31:57] <Tucker0603> while I do hate the "Pard" nickname, I do like the handler... especially when you get the Halloween dress or swimsuit....
[3:31:57] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Guildmarm IS Bae, but Handler has some merit.... cause while yes she get's in trouble a lot At least she is actually OUT THERE observing stuff first hand
[3:31:58] <FunkyStreams> @AngriestPat you hyped for the Monster Hunter movie with Milla?
[3:32:01] <+Zereaux> wish i was employed so i could buy and play this
[3:32:01] <42nfl19> does it actually do anything temp wise or purely cosmetics?
[3:32:04] <%VanaSkiller> @mayorrev that was way too well timed on my screen LUL
[3:32:08] <Valdorick> That armor is there so you can Slav Squad, Tovarish
[3:32:15] <ravencloak13> She’s back in Horafrost, we going to bother her just to leave again instead of stay and talk to gramama?!

[3:32:42] <Doodle_Taco> @soopahtoast I forgot about that F U C C
[3:32:49] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @Estuko True.... I honestly like Marm better
[3:32:51] <%Ion_Laser> Paul W.S. Anderson...Milla Jovovich...Again! NotLikeThis

[3:33:11] <%Shadicara> Boxerdios
[3:33:12] <haievery1> did pat not get an early copy
[3:33:13] <%dekkitout> Is blast really not good?
[3:33:14] <%ThePuddingDead> its just more raw, unmitigated damage
[3:33:15] <thesoldierofjoy> perhaps this fur coat is not the wisest thing to wear in a tropical jungle
[3:33:15] <IncredibleMeh> Who the fuck cares if blast isn't good, explosions all day
[3:33:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Blast Dual blades = Great jaggy never getting up
[3:33:16] <$realm_forge> SUPRISE MUTHAFUCKA
[3:33:17] <ravencloak13> Wouldn’t it have slime? Also how is blast not good?!
[3:33:17] <%Bane_Kaikyo> wait.... who said blast is not good?
[3:33:22] <Doodle_Taco> Brachydios Dual Blades are TehePelo TehePelo
[3:33:22] <ravencloak13> It causes explosions!
[3:33:23] <thenumberj42> we need fist weapons
[3:33:23] <Valdorick> You know what makes the Shadow of the Colossus movie better than the MonHun movie? SotC movie won't get made Kappa

[3:33:42] <ravencloak13> @valdorick SotC?
[3:33:42] <+Estuko> @Bane_Kaikyo 90% of the people do, she's just really fun character along with her obsession with monsters and you helping her get into that studies(?) college thingy through quests. So actual progression in her own little side story
[3:33:45] <Alexreznov> cat is riding jagras
[3:33:45] <%Shadicara> Blast breaks things for farming big dumdum
[3:33:47] <+Jekado> for grinding gear do you guys run the palico steal set?
[3:33:59] <Rexenexus> I'm gonna use that Brachy hammer even if it's the shittiest hammer in the game, it's my favorite and nothing can replace it because it's a fucking giant MACE
[3:34:00] <Valdorick> @ravencloak13 Shadow of the Colossus
[3:34:02] <%ThePuddingDead> thats not what u said tho
[3:34:02] <%dekkitout> Blast got nerfed?

[3:34:10] <thenumberj42> who cares whats best use what you love

[3:34:30] <+metalsiren31> Someday I will finally make that blast bow build
[3:34:30] <%Ninestempest> it isn't SLIME anymore it's BLAST
[3:34:32] <+BHPicasso> I just want Barioths anime ass armour
[3:34:33] <%Shadicara> If only they gave you big bracky fists as a weapon
[3:34:35] <%PauliusMaximus> he means 3
[3:34:35] <%mrshazboto> @AngriestPat you really should use jagras to practice full burst into TCS
[3:34:36] <$realm_forge> BEAT HIS ASS WHILE HIS CHILDREN WATCH
[3:34:37] <dipstere> slime was turned into blast pat
[3:34:39] <%dekkitout> The only time I saw blast was with pseudocanth IG or the KT blast GL
[3:34:40] <%PauliusMaximus> right?
[3:34:40] <Valdorick> Jagras bullying never stops!
[3:34:41] <Rexenexus> Blast was so fuckin good in Generation Ultimate
[3:34:42] <+Zereaux> does exist now
[3:34:43] <ravencloak13> Wait, I thought they were going to make it again cause anime was getting big and the Gundam movies coming out soon.
[3:34:45] <Doodle_Taco> @roundelay11 G-rank Jagro
[3:34:45] <%ThePuddingDead> this aint 3u ya dingus
[3:34:48] <+Zereaux> doesnt exist now
[3:34:52] <%Shadicara> OLD
[3:34:55] <%Ninestempest> it no LONGER exists
[3:35:01] <+Estuko> NotLikeThis 3U is considered old now
[3:35:03] <%Agami23> which is better, slime or blast? in your opinion i mean
[3:35:05] <Doodle_Taco> "It never happened"
[3:35:07] <%dekkitout> Oh, you mean that old jank shit
[3:35:09] <Rexenexus> Crimson Fatalis Insect Glaive was the SHIT
[3:35:10] <%ThePuddingDead> apparently elemental damage is getting super buffed
[3:35:13] <%PauliusMaximus> yeah but it was really good in 3u is what he's saying
[3:35:14] <%ThePuddingDead> which is cool
[3:35:16] <+Zereaux> 3u was considered old when it came out
[3:35:18] <Valdorick> RIP My IG :_(
[3:35:18] <%Ninestempest> also like anything else, doesn't it depedn on the game for how good it is?
[3:35:19] <%Shadicara> Slime was fucking bent as shit
[3:35:20] <thesoldierofjoy> oh Pat, since I got here late and I dont know if you answered already, your opinion on Rajang being added next month? Because this is my first game and my reaction was FUCK
[3:35:20] <ravencloak13> @estuko Isn’t that 5 years old? 3U?
[3:35:20] <butthurtdave> What country is this element from? It no longer exists
[3:35:25] <+ShortThrowDipstick> Wait why Jagras Hunt?
[3:35:37] <%SoFarFetched> he's getting master rank jagras armor
[3:35:39] <Valdorick> Its a G-ranked Jagras, so he can get started armor for G-ranks
[3:35:40] <ravencloak13> Slime actually broke the game cause it was the strongest bar none.
[3:35:46] <+Estuko> @ravencloak13 NotLikeThis I come from MHF2 my late best friend played that with me
[3:35:49] <thenumberj42> please dont bully jagras
[3:35:50] <Clyderso> thats a brutal cut
[3:35:54] <+RumiaTrain> There are probably a bunch of 5 year olds watching this stream so I guess that would be considered old
[3:35:55] <%Shadicara> Oh they put G rank finally?
[3:35:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> Buli Jaggy
[3:36:01] <%Shadicara> Let the pain begin LUL
[3:36:03] <Alexreznov> the helmet looks great

[3:36:26] <Psyramics> yeah, but this one doesnt vomit up decorations
[3:36:28] <valachi> @Shadicara How does it feel hiding under a rock for the past 5+ months?
[3:36:35] <%Venicilia> Tri was my first MH on the Wii
[3:36:35] <%dekkitout> He was trained by Count Greatest Jagras in your Hunter ways
[3:36:41] <+Jekado> @AngriestPat did you heard nintendo released some sorta new device for the switch controllers
[3:36:41] <%Rngiddion> hes not? he looks like the wuss he always is, just with more health
[3:36:47] <+Roundelay11> Doesn't seem all that different, tbh
[3:36:49] <+Estuko> @ravencloak13 I'm 24 lmao, I have it somewhere... I haven't touched it in several years. just a relic I treasure :)
[3:36:59] <JackaxeAM> damn what a tackle
[3:37:01] <+soopahtoast> I love that greatest jagras was just g rank jag
[3:37:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> Push over impys you have to put effort into pushing him
[3:37:07] <+Zereaux> did you just shoulder check it
[3:37:07] <thenumberj42> i always forget tackle exists
[3:37:08] <ravencloak13> I can’t play it anymore cause we lost our PSP’s.
[3:37:09] <%PauliusMaximus> is this PS4?
[3:37:12] <Saltmeisterr> but is he the greatest jagras?
[3:37:13] <+Zereaux> YES
[3:37:14] <%Shadicara> @valachi I mean I just started playing the switch version so I stopped caring LUL
[3:37:15] <%GarbageNirvana> I like how long it took to get out of the suspicious music into the actual battle music
[3:37:16] <Doodle_Taco> Pat you are trying to make him feel better but you are just embarassing him
[3:37:19] <ravencloak13> PS4. PC is January.
[3:37:22] <valachi> Oh so G Rank Jagras is just the AT version

[3:37:28] <+soopahtoast> royal ludroth is fun
[3:37:31] <+JavaManJoJo> Royal Ludroth looked so sad once you broke his sponge
[3:37:31] <+Zereaux> FOR ALL NOT IN THE KNOW IT IS PS4 ONLY
[3:37:33] <%ThePuddingDead> does he know about the new water e.d.?
[3:37:34] <butthurtdave> that reminds me, Pat how did you like Water Combat in 3?
[3:37:34] <%GarbageNirvana> He's basically the ludroth stand-in
[3:37:36] <thenumberj42> i miss mh3
[3:37:38] <+AllenDeadman> it's the bastard son of royal ludroth and zamitrios
[3:37:39] <wakeuplvl3> i miss lagaicrus
[3:37:41] <thenumberj42> even if swimming was jank
[3:37:45] <ravencloak13> @valachi No, that was the big one that was AT.
[3:37:47] <Rexenexus> Ludroth's gunner armor just made you Naruto
[3:37:47] <%PauliusMaximus> I thought Pat swore off PS4 that's all XS
[3:37:48] <+Estuko> @ravencloak13 I still have mine, the original. with the same exact piece of tape I stuck on it several years ago. that's some good ass tape LUL it kept the battery case part shut because I dropped it once
[3:37:50] <+BoomerTiro> That looked like a great way to travel
[3:37:51] <+Jekado> should of popped a dash juice
[3:37:55] <jon651> Don't forget your raider ride
[3:37:56] <jettybandit> Yeah but royal ludroth was more majestic
[3:37:58] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat When I played MHGU I actually noticed Royal Ludroth and Great Jagras share a few moves
[3:38:02] <jettybandit> Truely Royal
[3:38:12] <valachi> @ravencloak13 Yeah and this version has literally all of the same new moves that AT had which is what I knew Crapcom was gonna do

[3:40:36] <thesoldierofjoy> way to be classist, Pat
[3:40:36] <JaerHQ> Pat to old handler: shut the fuck up Pat to new handler: shut the fuck up
[3:40:37] <%PanicSwytch> Pat is the true fat evil
[3:40:38] <%Faustgesicht> Russian
[3:40:38] <$realm_forge> Pavlov would be proud
[3:40:40] <BlueSpartan119> Komrade
[3:40:41] <LixFury> COMRAD
[3:40:41] <%walternatorz> Pat is racist against Handlers.
[3:40:41] <ravencloak13> ...This is what happens when you live with anger, you are blinded by it, consumed by it. Like all of you.
[3:40:43] <Tucker0603> FUCKING RAD
[3:40:45] <%republicofu> Russia
[3:40:46] <thenumberj42> komrade kodachi
[3:40:47] <%dekkitout> Hello, Comrad!
[3:40:47] <mossypebble222> viper kadachi gives me such russian vibes
[3:40:53] <%SoFarFetched> @Alexreznov I meant more on the wait cause pat was suddenly yelling at her for no reason when it's not the old handler LUL
[3:40:57] <Valdorick> These are really rad outfits IN A GAME WITHOUT PROPER TRANSMOG PunOko
[3:41:00] <Valdorick> <--- Hoe that is mad
[3:41:02] <ravencloak13> Why is Viper Kodachi just Russian outfit?
[3:41:05] <+rmsjrr> Is master rank G rank in this game?
[3:41:05] <+Nomenanza> I've just been farming vanilla MR monsters. Havent even done the first Hoarfrost expedition quest
[3:41:09] <thenumberj42> lack of transmog hurts my soul
[3:41:09] <kehnimentu> the real poison is capitalism
[3:41:13] <%mrshazboto> Jagras / Jagras / Kulu / Hornetaur / Hornetaur is the way toi go
[3:41:17] <+Jekado> handler is basically wesley from star trek TNG
[3:41:17] <+Estuko> @thenumberj42 same...
[3:41:17] <ravencloak13> @valdorick No that is a genuine thing to be mad about.
[3:41:17] <%Faustgesicht> Why don't we just full-on fire keeper the Handler?
[3:41:23] <Doodle_Taco> @ravencloak13 Because ice I guess
[3:41:24] <Psyramics> make both
[3:41:25] <butthurtdave> lose the shorts
[3:41:25] <TheHotStuven> Behemoth + :)
[3:41:27] <valachi> You have no good G rank decos, go for Alpha
[3:41:28] <%ThePuddingDead> go alpha for now on ps4, then go beta on PC
[3:41:33] <+dantejoestar21> a gives you everything you want right now
[3:41:34] <%superc37> Beta.

[3:41:35] <Clyderso> Bahamut
[3:41:36] <thesoldierofjoy> Alpha for now, beta when you get the gems to customize

[3:41:37] <MadDesperado13> B
[3:41:37] <roflwaffleauthoritah> alpha since you'll be ditching it soon anyway
[3:41:38] <reddpop_> Is this a fresh file?
[3:41:39] <Museihatsu> they are making it so all armor sets have a layered armor set now
[3:41:40] <mossypebble222> it has attack and element boost
[3:41:45] <jon651> 116 Def! Wow!
[3:41:46] <+ShortThrowDipstick> Can’t go wrong with more slots
[3:41:47] <ravencloak13> @doodle_taco I mean, the Bambaros the viking one.
[3:41:49] <Doodle_Taco> Go for Alpha, you are going to change to another anyway
[3:41:49] <%cylish> Why plan for long term when youre just gonna being switching to PC in januar
[3:41:53] <+Estuko> heheh
[3:41:54] <+Zereaux> @AngriestPat so are they done with this gen of monhun and gonna do a full relaunch on ps5 or is this like the last iteration of this entry of the game?
[3:42:11] <Doodle_Taco> @ravencloak13 Motifs I guess
[3:42:15] <%ThePuddingDead> evade extender is the tits for all offensive weapons
[3:42:17] <ravencloak13> Oh, you think PS5 is a thing... cute.
[3:42:18] <Psyramics> wishlist it
[3:42:25] <Valdorick> Because ideally anything he gets in this he'll feels better about modding into his PC save LUL
[3:42:26] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Fey Wyvern Gem, whatever that is
[3:42:29] <thesoldierofjoy> You night need parts from regular Jagras too, not just Great Jagras
[3:42:35] <KingZaffy> Fey Wyvern Gem was for the GS
[3:42:36] <valachi> I mean it is, the entire console got shown off
[3:42:42] <+ShortThrowDipstick> Wishlist it
[3:42:47] <%dekkitout> Do augments even drop in G rank
[3:42:51] <+ShortThrowDipstick> Cool
[3:42:54] <ravencloak13> Hahaha... yeah like that’s going to matter...
[3:43:06] <+Zereaux> ps5=whatever next gen shit ccomes out
[3:43:06] <ravencloak13> Also when did it get shown off.
[3:43:21] <+Estuko> LUL does chat remember the xbox 720
[3:43:24] <thenumberj42> ps5 is a pizza slice warmer
[3:43:30] <%PauliusMaximus> the dev console was leaked
[3:43:31] <valachi> Fucking like months ago
[3:43:37] <%Shadicara> Xbox 420
[3:43:37] <+ShortThrowDipstick> @angriestpat how you liking IceBorne so far
[3:43:39] <ravencloak13> When?
[3:43:39] <+Nomenanza> yeah Astera feels smoother
[3:43:42] <jon651> Did they? it still looks like shit
[3:43:44] <Valdorick> We need the X-Box 180
[3:43:51] <$realm_forge> Good no go apologize to better handler for your outburst
[3:43:51] <thesoldierofjoy> It does look better,. yeah
[3:43:56] <ravencloak13> It looks the same so still good.
[3:43:56] <%Venicilia> Thats cuz stream lag
[3:44:02] <dezik45> PS4 pro?
[3:44:08] <+Zereaux> i hope dragons dogma 2 looks this good
[3:44:31] <%PauliusMaximus> so them fixed it?
[3:44:32] <%Anime_Flux> word
[3:44:32] <butthurtdave> i hope dragon's dogma 2 is real
[3:44:32] <Valdorick> I hope world convinced CAPCOM that we 100% want fucking Dragons Dogma 2
[3:44:35] <%Svanyr> Be like assss
[3:44:36] <Caidezes> fuck
[3:44:40] <+Jekado> does paige play mhw?
[3:44:40] <danknugglit> Do you have prioritize framerate on?
[3:44:42] <thenumberj42> hey guys remember deep down
[3:44:43] <+Nomenanza> I already hit spots where framerate dips but that was the case even before when you stood in the middle of clusterfuck of particles
[3:44:47] <+Jekado> would pat and paige every play together?
[3:44:52] <IncredibleMeh> "Know what I mean?"
[3:44:53] <+Nomenanza> so overall they improved the performance
[3:44:57] <%umbypokochan> are you saying fuck and shit? cuz then yeah
[3:45:03] <Rexenexus> tfw base PS4
[3:45:15] <jon651> You also need Jagras parts too!
[3:45:19] <+Zereaux> in the world we live in we got nier:automata no way in fucking hell are we not getting dragons dogma 2
[3:45:24] <$realm_forge> @jekado pat would play and Paige would run around screaming
[3:45:31] <Valdorick> Remember PC MonHun world players - if you're playing with friends, and those friends don't have Dragon's Dogma yet, you tell them to get it until they fucking do.
[3:45:32] <+Nomenanza> GS feels real good
[3:45:33] <%SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:45:36] <zenobygoat> what's different with true slash?
[3:45:39] <bashful_bard> That tcs animation is great
[3:45:41] <thenumberj42> we are getting fucking deadly premonition 2, dragons dogma 2 is definitely a thing
[3:45:47] <danknugglit> Whats new with gs?
[3:45:48] <+Nomenanza> I am having a boner about actually good Switch axe fade slash
[3:45:49] <%ThePuddingDead> try other ammo dude
[3:45:52] <+Nomenanza> that move is amazing now
[3:45:53] <butthurtdave> @zenobygoat , if you hit the first slash, it buffs the final slash
[3:45:58] <+Jekado> @realm_forge how does she scream with all the mustard in her mouth
[3:45:59] <zenobygoat> oh dope
[3:46:02] <valachi> Deadly Premonition 2 is probably gonna suck though
[3:46:06] <thenumberj42> good
[3:46:10] <$realm_forge> Haaaa!
[3:46:16] <%PanicSwytch> Any kind of improvements in GL?
[3:46:18] <%Shadicara> Should also remaster Dmc 2 into a real game Kappa
[3:46:19] <%ThePuddingDead> i think u need 9 in total
[3:46:21] <%Cthulos> We need D4 finished
[3:46:27] <Valdorick> @valachi DP1 sucked too, it depends on the camp of the suck though.
[3:46:30] <thenumberj42> if dp2 doesn't suck i will be disappointed
[3:46:30] <+Zereaux> Swery totally didnt watch true detective
[3:46:30] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Monster droped slinger ammo is really good too
[3:46:38] <+Jekado> i predict zach morgan from Deadly premontion in Smash
[3:46:44] <+soopahtoast> dragons dogma is sooooo Kreygasm
[3:46:46] <Vermillion129> boi oh boi
[3:46:52] <xeros720> just use shortcut 2 pat
[3:46:54] <valachi> @Valdorick The bad kind of suck, the kind of suck that isn't fun. Even with Swery working on the game the devs are still pretty bad.
[3:46:55] <butthurtdave> @PanicSwytch , you can load slinger ammo into its stake and it attaches a bomb to them that stays on and explodes every time you hit it
[3:47:01] <Valdorick> Oh noooooooooo D:
[3:47:05] <+dantejoestar21> Mr Fracis Zach Morgan
[3:47:05] <+Zereaux> Dragons Dogma 2
[3:47:10] <+Jekado> does pat only use shortcut 1?
[3:47:15] <danknugglit> Id put it in ammo if u dont use guns
[3:47:15] <tag545> passed it
[3:47:21] <thesoldierofjoy> I havent seen you use demondrugs or armorskins once, Pat. Replace those.
[3:47:27] <+Jekado> i use all 4 slots and i feel like i need more
[3:47:29] <+soopahtoast> dragons dogma jester in smash
[3:47:39] <+Zereaux> this is re4 chill out with the inventory shit fuckers
[3:47:41] <%PanicSwytch> @butthurtdave thanx
[3:47:53] <ScreamLord> @Zereaux The guy that did DMC5 also wanted to do Dragon's Dogma 2 so hopefully we'll get an announcement for that soon
[3:47:54] <Valdorick> Besides! Look at all the new chapters of Berserk that have come out since Dragon's Dogma 1...…. oh wait... Fuck
[3:47:59] <Vermillion129> Pack of wolves from Dragon Dogma for Smash
[3:48:00] <%ThePuddingDead> its fast as hell
[3:48:01] <+Estuko> Wait, can you roam around or is in a direction
[3:48:03] <thenumberj42> so fast
[3:48:12] <thenumberj42> and you get a free jump off it? wow
[3:48:12] <+Nomenanza> it is automatic @Estuko
[3:48:13] <%ThePuddingDead> u have a jaggy calvary
[3:48:14] <+Jekado> @Estuko you set its destination
[3:48:16] <+soopahtoast> @valdorick BibleThump
[3:48:17] <+Estuko> @Nomenanza that's cool too
[3:48:18] <+Jekado> like a uber
[3:48:18] <JackaxeAM> geez
[3:48:18] <Vermillion129> It's go straight to the monster
[3:48:18] <+Nomenanza> it basically is a fast travel
[3:48:22] <tag545> its marker based
[3:48:31] <jon651> Raider Ride is the best
[3:48:31] <+Jekado> accept unlike uber it would molest you
[3:48:33] <%ThePuddingDead> @Jekado except there's no rape!
[3:48:36] <%Shadicara> based jaggy
[3:48:39] <%Svanyr> Smack dat bell
[3:48:49] <+Jekado> @ThePuddingDead lol
[3:48:51] <+Estuko> SHAKE HIS BAG
[3:48:52] <+soopahtoast> slappa da tum
[3:49:01] <Vermillion129> I like how most of my equipment from high rank are useless now
[3:49:03] <ScreamLord> Pop the bag
[3:49:05] <%mrshazboto> @AngriestPat you know you can do a circle slash after TCS and combo right back into a Full Burst and another TCS?
[3:49:08] <+BoomerTiro> Are disposable earplugs or other earplug items back?
[3:49:11] <danknugglit> He seems faster
[3:49:13] <@lewdskeletor13> Give Emlo big pets
[3:49:14] <valachi> That's how G Rank works @Vermillion129
[3:49:14] <+Zereaux> any buff for the insect glaive?
[3:49:15] <thenumberj42> sell all your hr armor lol
[3:49:16] <%ThePuddingDead> it is
[3:49:19] <%ThePuddingDead> less animation frames
[3:49:31] <%ThePuddingDead> r2
[3:49:32] <danknugglit> Neat
[3:49:33] <tag545> its better for changing directions
[3:49:36] <jon651> Pat he's angry
[3:49:38] <ravencloak13> @zereaux It got an instant down move.
[3:49:38] <Vermillion129> He's enrage put
[3:49:38] <Doodle_Taco> He mad
[3:49:39] <%SoFarFetched> hoes mad
[3:49:40] <jon651> it won't work
[3:49:45] <IncredibleMeh> It's a choice between safety and stun I gather
[3:49:52] <Thelovelybison> shoulder charge decreases the damage of true charge, the full combo is still the most damage out of it
[3:50:03] <Thelovelybison> not sure if slinger gives true charge the max damage, though
[3:50:10] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Enraged = immune to clutch CC
[3:50:14] <mossypebble222> flailing on your side while you vomit all over yourself. this jagras learned from pat
[3:50:18] <+Nomenanza> GS clutch slash is so savage
[3:50:21] <%wubi_desu> wubi_desu subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:50:25] <+Zereaux> any switch axe buffs?
[3:50:27] <%SoFarFetched> better sharpen
[3:50:28] <Thelovelybison> before the best combo for damage was raw 1st slash>charge to 1 level>full charge true slash
[3:50:29] <Vermillion129> so quicc
[3:50:32] <Vermillion129> so gud
[3:50:33] <+Nomenanza> @Zereaux a lot
[3:50:35] <thenumberj42> LUL
[3:50:35] <Caidezes> LUL
[3:50:36] <jon651> LOL
[3:50:36] <%SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:50:38] <+Zereaux> sorrt chargeblade
[3:50:38] <JackaxeAM> uh oh
[3:50:39] <Doodle_Taco> LUL
[3:50:39] <%ThePuddingDead> what
[3:50:40] <ravencloak13> @zereaux Also gunlance.
[3:50:44] <%PauliusMaximus> LUL
[3:50:49] <+Jekado> the mount attack off the... mount is cool
[3:50:55] <+Zereaux> the sword and sheild that turns into an axe
[3:51:00] <+Nomenanza> @Zereaux charge blade has a bunch of new moves
[3:51:08] <+Nomenanza> makes your axe mode into a saw
[3:51:08] <zenobygoat> skinny!
[3:51:11] <%DKDiamantes> Das a big boop
[3:51:17] <+Jekado> i need to practice the SnS perfect combo i can't time it right
[3:51:18] <Thelovelybison> cb did get nerfed in other areas though
[3:51:20] <+Zereaux> the make behemoth easier yet?
[3:51:23] <thesoldierofjoy> BONK
[3:51:25] <bashful_bard> That was goofy
[3:51:29] <Thelovelybison> for example, you need guard 3 now to not stagger on a GP block
[3:51:33] <+soopahtoast> boop dat .jag snoot
[3:51:34] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Supposedly the optimum DPS combo for GS combo is 0-1 Charge, 2 Charge, 3 Charge
[3:51:38] <%PauliusMaximus> hi dk :D
[3:51:38] <thenumberj42> this jagras bullying is making me sad
[3:51:43] <thesoldierofjoy> That was the monhun equivalent of an Irish Whip
[3:51:44] <xeros720> dat boi got wrekt
[3:51:50] <Tucker0603> can't wait for of iceborne for the CB changes
[3:51:53] <+soopahtoast> GATCHABITCH
[3:51:54] <Vermillion129> No one really use axe mode other than amp discharge in base game, they really did have to buff axe mode
[3:51:54] <%mrshazboto> @Zereaux you could already cheese it with a party of 4 giving one person infinite stamina and riding it
[3:51:56] <%DKDiamantes> @PauliusMaximus apatOrange
[3:51:56] <Raginyre> So many 500s and 700s
[3:51:56] <transporterthesequel> No bully all Jagras
[3:51:56] <+AllenDeadman> iguana captured
[3:51:57] <%SoFarFetched> NOT ELMO
[3:52:01] <+Jekado> don't hit elmo
[3:52:01] <%spiritofmojave> emlo abuse
[3:52:06] <%SoFarFetched> sausage time for elmo
[3:52:07] <%Shadicara> GS hits are so dirty in this game
[3:52:11] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Pls give a Savage Jagras
[3:52:12] <Rexenexus> Is it always better to cap or carve in this game, because I know in the olds you weren't guaranteed as much stuff every cap.
[3:52:13] <+Jekado> there is a level 3 charge for the GS i think
[3:52:18] <%SoFarFetched> great sword gets 3 charges
[3:52:20] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat the combo you just did
[3:52:21] <+Jekado> the TRUE charge
[3:52:25] <+Zereaux> i dont have ps plus so i gotta solo it but i am an insectglaive main
[3:52:32] <Thelovelybison> @AngriestPat that's the best combo for GS, since shoulder cancelling decreases true charge damage
[3:52:32] <+Estuko> @Rexenexus depends on the situation, but break + cap always gives best reward.
[3:52:44] <Thelovelybison> usually fits most stagger phases as well
[3:52:46] <%Ninestempest> in mhw didn't they just make it better
[3:52:47] <%SoFarFetched> Pat didn't shout at handler this time LUL good job
[3:52:51] <xeros720> cap ends the fight faster, so after a certain point, you'll see most people capping
[3:52:55] <+Torei_san> The pools are the same in World.
[3:52:56] <+Jekado> carve is better for getting specific draws i think but capping is still better
[3:53:04] <Vermillion129> Jagras helmet and mail is super good early game
[3:53:04] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Yes
[3:53:12] <Anthony_smith_88> Don’t break my heart with “temporary” partner
[3:53:13] <%Shadicara> The jagras pummelling has quelled pat's handler abuse
[3:53:16] <manoshake> You can use slinger burst beetwen charges pat
[3:53:16] <Valdorick> Though the tougher enemies can't be capped, so they're always carved
[3:53:17] <Thelovelybison> yup
[3:53:21] <%FluffiTamamo> Temporary partner? Did that loud bitch finally eat it??
[3:53:21] <+kuervojones> @Vermillion129 So SwAx got a buff? Its worth using now?
[3:53:23] <Rexenexus> I always thought carving gave you more normie rewards but cap for more rare stuff, but I guess they changed it to where capping gives you both a bunch of normie rewards and rare stuff
[3:53:27] <+Jekado> pat why don't forget you can use your armor and demon drug potions for a boost
[3:53:30] <tag545> they are trying to force hit, slinger, tcs, by nerfing the other moves
[3:53:37] <+AllenDeadman> ime to murder small jagras
[3:53:51] <Thelovelybison> however never neglect the shoulder charges iframes in a pinch
[3:53:53] <%D33TR> is pat still gonna wait for PC version
[3:53:56] <Thelovelybison> hyper armour, rather
[3:54:04] <%Anime_Flux> I've missed your MHW streams, glad you're doing it
[3:54:06] <@lewdskeletor13> Pat is addicted again
[3:54:08] <Vermillion129> Not a SwAx user in world sorry, but from what I have seen Rocksteady + Clutch claw into discharge is super strong
[3:54:12] <Doodle_Taco> Alright everyone, I think that's it for me. Good night to all!! KonCha KonCha
[3:54:13] <%ThePuddingDead> cant wait for new wyvernsnipe >;3
[3:54:17] <%DKDiamantes> I made the mistake of trying to get back into this by using Hunting Horn when it re-released on PC
[3:54:18] <bashful_bard> They're cheap af tho
[3:54:18] <jon651> imagine buffing for G. Jagras lol
[3:54:18] <Valdorick> Tryhard on the enemies that need you to try harder.
[3:54:19] <@lewdskeletor13> @doodle_taco Night
[3:54:21] <%SoFarFetched> Goodnight @Doodle_Taco
[3:54:28] <butthurtdave> Do you even need the screamer pods?

[3:55:38] <xeros720> glad they have a sound byte to let you know too
[3:55:39] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat Did you forget about resuppling at the fucking camp?
[3:55:39] <%SoFarFetched> TIME TO MINE FOR SPHERES
[3:55:44] <Thelovelybison> wait what the fuck that looked like a silver los dropping, is he in this game?
[3:55:48] <%DKDiamantes> @Buttku Cause I was so used to using Insect Glaive on PS4 and wanted a change... but Hunting Horn... oof
[3:55:48] <+Jekado> does he not have camp 17?
[3:55:53] <+Jekado> a lot people miss that one
[3:55:54] <butthurtdave> did...did people not already have enough armor spheres?
[3:56:01] <%SoFarFetched> you can never have enough
[3:56:02] <Mortal_Wombat_I> They drop you either on top of the monster, or into a rare resource hot spot
[3:56:03] <%SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:56:04] <thesoldierofjoy> WE UPGRADING GEOLOGIST CHARM, BOIS
[3:56:06] <%mrshazboto> Is it even worth it to buy a PS4 pro at this point?
[3:56:08] <+Jekado> he doesn't need resuply
[3:56:11] <Frolomeo> When’s warframe?
[3:56:14] <Vermillion129> Overall you have way higher chance to get drop in random location/in front of monster in Iceborne
[3:56:15] <+Jekado> he's fighting jag
[3:56:19] <+ChunLoArt> Why is he farming Jagras?
[3:56:24] <xeros720> i'm not even sure you can buy a ps4 pro
[3:56:25] <%Shadicara> Hunting horn is the weapon of gentlemen Kappa
[3:56:25] <Vermillion129> He want the set
[3:56:27] <%Faustgesicht> What's oof about Hunting Horn, DK?
[3:56:28] <+dantejoestar21> armor
[3:56:30] <Valdorick> Because G-Jag has his set
[3:56:38] <%dekkitout> G Rank Jaggy set is a decent starter set, that's why
[3:56:39] <+Estuko> @mrshazboto depends how much you value the... exclusives and where your friends are playing. I'm sticking with PC. I got my first gen ps4, still works. that's fine for me.
[3:56:45] <%ThePuddingDead> but dont take this support weapon for granted
[3:56:50] <Thelovelybison> grank jag has good perks for the main campaign, attackboost, speed eating, etc @ChunLoArt
[3:56:51] <%ThePuddingDead> said no hunting horn main EVER
[3:56:52] <+Jekado> i'm not sure why pat runs 10 honeys i assume to craft megas?
[3:56:56] <%Venicilia> Oy, that aint no Jaggy
[3:56:56] <+Estuko> @ThePuddingDead LUL such a good video

[3:57:16] <+Estuko> monkaS
[3:57:16] <+BoomerTiro> WHY IS THAT OUTSIDE EL DORADO!?
[3:57:16] <%mrshazboto> @Estuko have first gen ps4 and was considering an external SSD, but figured that it could only increase so much
[3:57:16] <thenumberj42> hmm
[3:57:16] <+AllenDeadman> KULVE?
[3:57:17] <Vermillion129> Gold Rathian

[3:57:28] <+xGreenflame> It's kulve
[3:57:29] <Psyramics> he hasn't done the Kulve Taroth intro quests
[3:57:31] <%ThePuddingDead> wait...
[3:57:31] <+AllenDeadman> it's either kulve or gold rathian

[3:57:33] <%ThePuddingDead> excuse me
[3:57:33] <+Jekado> nah gold jagras!

[3:57:34] <tag545> its the same kulve gold even
[3:57:36] <DanielisAwesome52> The Gold is because Pat didnt do the Kulve stuff on COnsole
[3:57:36] <thenumberj42> lol it's kulve
[3:57:36] <butthurtdave> BOOO
[3:57:36] <moosemonkey397> gold and silver raths are confirmed yeah

[3:57:47] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Excuse me?
[3:57:47] <+AllenDeadman> oh fuck...
[3:57:48] <CountMeowingtonn> gasp, i thought pat was gonna wait for the pc version to come out '-'
[3:57:52] <Mortal_Wombat_I> WHOMSTVE??
[3:57:54] <+Estuko> @mrshazboto I have a 1TB of extra data, I'd recommend that so you can just download all the free ps4 games your friends might have. or any ps classics (that might luckily hop onto ps4...)
[3:57:55] <+BHPicasso> what about deviants?
[3:57:56] <%Shadicara> They're back to terrorise humanity in HD
[3:57:57] <butthurtdave> i wanted my ura subspecies :C
[3:57:58] <Valdorick> But pat has Gold Tulv unlocked on PS4, doesn't he? So it wouldn't be ???? would it?
[3:57:59] <Vermillion129> Who would get excited for Master Rank Kulve LUL
[3:57:59] <%Laecerelius> It's January!
[3:58:00] <+Estuko> Oh fuck Gold Rathion god please
[3:58:01] <thenumberj42> crazy talk activate
[3:58:01] <thesoldierofjoy> Nah, you found the same tracks for Kulve taroth, this is where I found them in my game.
[3:58:02] <+BoomerTiro> @ThePuddingDead I make my best guns out of Gold Rathians
[3:58:05] <%PanicSwytch> Rajang scares me
[3:58:05] <CountMeowingtonn> STOP BULLYING JAGGY BibleThump
[3:58:18] <%Agami23> pat probably didnt do kulv on ps4
[3:58:18] <ravencloak13> @countmeowingtonn I NEED HISPOWER!
[3:58:22] <+AllenDeadman> remember to kill a bunch of small jagras for the shards pat
[3:58:29] <Vermillion129> It's good he didnt do Kulve
[3:58:31] <thesoldierofjoy> Pat never fought KT
[3:58:32] <manoshake> Master rank jagras is not playing around
[3:58:33] <%ThePuddingDead> jaggy's that one kid who'll do the truffle shuffle unironically
[3:58:33] <%Shadicara> @panicswytch Yeah that never stops ever. No one gets used to Rajang
[3:58:34] <%goose_attack_almanac> I don't think he did Kulve in general
[3:58:37] <thenumberj42> kulve was a mistake
[3:58:40] <+smacksfenton> hey chat, do you guys think iceborne is worth it for solo play? I own og MHW but never started it up. thanks for any advice
[3:58:41] <+Jekado> @Valdorick i don't think he hunted kulve on ps4
[3:58:41] <Vermillion129> I regret doing Kulve with Iceborne being a thing
[3:58:46] <butthurtdave> god Kulve is the worst
[3:58:54] <%ThePuddingDead> the fact chicks who like jaggy's personality
[3:58:54] <butthurtdave> fight's cool but that weapon shit is abysmal
[3:58:56] <tag545> its the great get away from pat migration
[3:59:02] <%Ninestempest> @smacksfenton playing all of mhw solo is completely fine
[3:59:02] <thenumberj42> kulve was an interesting idea but giving him all those weapons was terrible
[3:59:03] <Thelovelybison> i got lucky
[3:59:05] <bashful_bard> Kulve was fun till it wasn't
[3:59:06] <%mrshazboto> I bet EVERYONE regrets doing AT Kulve with Iceborne being at hing
[3:59:06] <thesoldierofjoy> Kulve is a fun monster, but I dont like the raid mechanics.
[3:59:11] <Vermillion129> 100+ hr farming random loot for minmax? Your weapon is garbage now
[3:59:12] <Valdorick> Ah, well then, my old mind is addled.
[3:59:16] <Thelovelybison> in one weekend of kulve I got the meta lance and meta hammer
[3:59:17] <%ThePuddingDead> it was a neat change in pace
[3:59:23] <+Jekado> i never did kulve just never bothered with it
[3:59:31] <thenumberj42> i wouldn't mind seeing more siege shit as long as they don't do that weapon shit again
[3:59:32] <%ThePuddingDead> it wasnt spectacular but it was neat
[3:59:34] <manoshake> jagras is tired from being bullied
[3:59:34] <+Estuko> @Jekado same.
[3:59:37] <+smacksfenton> @Ninestempest Do you mean fine in thats it's only okay or that it's a similarly fun experience to playing w friends? thanks btw
[3:59:40] <+Estuko> @thenumberj42 weapon?
[3:59:44] <%kujofire990> bulli
[3:59:46] <+Gilwynofthevalencia> Is this vanilla monster hunter?
[3:59:48] <%ThePuddingDead> gimme yer LUNCH MONEY DWEEB
[3:59:48] <thenumberj42> he had 100 weapons and most were the best
[3:59:49] <Daniel_Is_I> Jagras hears ya, Jagras don't care.
[3:59:50] <CountMeowingtonn> jaggy FeelsBadMan
[3:59:52] <+Estuko> @Gilwynofthevalencia Icebourne
[3:59:54] <%Shadicara> BULLY
[3:59:56] <ravencloak13> @vermillion129 You say that like that ISN’T what we play the monster hunter series for.
[4:00:01] <%Venicilia> TFW people call Great Jagras, Jaggy, and you realize that Great Jaggi likely will not come back :'(
[4:00:08] <%dekkitout> Jaggy has 'Always Tired' tattooed under his eye
[4:00:09] <%goose_attack_almanac> could Jagras always vomit like that?
[4:00:11] <ravencloak13> Remember those relic weapons or whatever they were in the DS games?
[4:00:14] <%Ninestempest> @smacksfenton i mean, the game is always better with people cause it's kinda made like that, but it's fun solo and scaled really well for solo
[4:00:23] <ravencloak13> @goose_attack_almanac Yes, he just does it more now.
[4:00:25] <%Shadicara> It's so meaty that last hit
[4:00:25] <%ThePuddingDead> good read
[4:00:25] <%goose_attack_almanac> Beefiest?
[4:00:28] <thesoldierofjoy> the Chunk is Stunk
[4:00:28] <+Gilwynofthevalencia> I was wondering since he kept grappling the monster thanks
[4:00:40] <%ThePuddingDead> maybe later
[4:00:41] <butthurtdave> I miss my street sharks
[4:00:44] <BlueSpartan119> dont remind me :(
[4:00:48] <+smacksfenton> @Ninestempest dope! thanks. Picking up tonight while I can still get the preorder bonuses
[4:00:49] <Rexenexus> Inflation shark
[4:00:52] <Monkeyweed21> but you got a good piscine
[4:00:55] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan Zamtrios' armour was so fucking cool
[4:00:55] <%ThePuddingDead> we got a SHIT load of new monsters pat doesnt even know about
[4:00:56] <butthurtdave> I'm still holding a torch for Agnaktor
[4:00:56] <WeebFever> Zam AND gammoth are missing
[4:00:58] <%Shadicara> Fat Cell shark
[4:00:59] <bashful_bard> This is making me want to gs this xpac so bad
[4:01:04] <thesoldierofjoy> I love the fetish shark
[4:01:06] <%goose_attack_almanac> Are you forgetting the Arc of Deliverance in Dragon's Dogma
[4:01:06] <%dekkitout> Zammy was jawesome
[4:01:07] <+BoomerTiro> Zam will be added in the next expansions, which will also bring about the most ambitious crossover ever
[4:01:10] <+lucaflow> I knew Pat had an inflation fetish
[4:01:11] <+dantejoestar21> I'm still waiting on Gore/Shageru Magala
[4:01:13] <majindusto> Ahh...I see Pat did the "Backdown" and got Iceborne on PS4 lol
[4:01:13] <%shin_garbage> We got Yian Garguga tho :^)
[4:01:17] <+BoomerTiro> Monster Hunter World: Bloodborne
[4:01:23] <Monkeyweed21> hows iceborne so far?
[4:01:27] <manoshake> Namielle is fucking cool pat
[4:01:32] <tag545> zam ascended into elder dragon status as velkhana. with the leftovers jammed into chungus
[4:01:34] <%ThePuddingDead> chat...yo chat yo, namiel....i cant fuckin wait...AND zinogre
[4:01:38] <+Estuko> @goose_attack_almanac that thing terrifies me.
[4:01:43] <BlueSpartan119> Beo is cool but cant compete with Zam
[4:01:45] <butthurtdave> So with Namielle that brings the number of Water monsters in the game up to 2, right?
[4:01:45] <%Venicilia> in all seriousness, I wonder why we didnt get any of the Great Raptor monsters, like Jaggi or Wroggi
[4:01:46] <bendatron> where are gore and shigeru is the important question
[4:01:46] <Thelovelybison> dont remind me that yian is back
[4:01:48] <%Scrub_Seeker> @goose_attack_almanac okay but what about arc of OBLITERATION
[4:01:51] <xeros720> SIR? SIR! SIR...
[4:01:55] <@commanderclaw> He won't sleep if you're in sight now IIRC
[4:02:01] <%dekkitout> People are already on jelly-dragon?
[4:02:06] <ravencloak13> @venicilia Because we got an equivalent.
[4:02:12] <+AllenDeadman> you were in his way
[4:02:12] <WeebFever> Monsters no longer sleep if you walk into the same areas they're resting in
[4:02:13] <thenumberj42> he wants to put out of his misery already
[4:02:16] <%dekkitout> Let him die! BibleThump
[4:02:17] <Monkeyweed21> killing his children pat
[4:02:17] <%ThePuddingDead> aww he's licking u
[4:02:21] <Vermillion129> People already beat Iceborne
[4:02:21] <%shin_garbage> Also i just tuned in pat why are you hunting a (asuumedly) MR Great Jagras
[4:02:21] <+Jekado> time to put that bitch to sleep permantely
[4:02:22] <WeebFever> it was part of the update
[4:02:23] <jon651> Time to die you p.o.s.
[4:02:24] <%spiritofmojave> @goose_attack_almanac that arc is what i hoped GS would be in this game
[4:02:27] <thesoldierofjoy> \Playin it smart, thats what the fuck he doin patty

[4:02:51] <%Anime_Flux> hehe

[4:02:57] <%ThePuddingDead> you'll cowards dont even unhinge yo jaws
[4:03:02] <Thelovelybison> i wish we got insectoid monster again though
[4:03:04] <xeros720> yeah, they already announced more monsters coming in title updates
[4:03:09] <%goose_attack_almanac> @spiritofmojave I hear ya. But it's as beefy as can be without being a full on RPG
[4:03:10] <bashful_bard> That was 3, no?
[4:03:10] <haveswordmuststing> must not me a good mixtape, he's only got water damage

[4:04:24] <%arcaderabbit48> @ravencloak13 Wow, I was guessing on the shark made of ice. I thought electric goku monkey was shown in the last trailer though?
[4:04:28] <Monkeyweed21> he was screaming about jim sterling
[4:04:28] <Thelovelybison> Thick bones drop off of Kulve Taroth 😉
[4:04:32] <%arcaderabbit48> Also, UGGGGGGGH more fucking grinding

[4:10:00] <manoshake> chill monster streams are the best
[4:10:01] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat seems like the type of game you would play on fridays honestly
[4:10:03] <majindusto> Chill is BAD?
[4:10:06] <Mister_McDerp> chill is good
[4:10:07] <%TheSniperJoe> TheSniperJoe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! 31 Months and going, woohoo! Just dropping in to say, looking forward to River City Girls.

[4:11:29] <%ThePuddingDead> Yo u should cook and see if serious handler has any new animations for it
[4:11:29] <Monkeyweed21> I cant believe the handler is dead
[4:11:33] <dezik45> Time to get that hat.
[4:11:34] <$realm_forge> Remnant fucking rocks!
[4:11:38] <+demon1103> Remember people, its easy to fix handler...just change game language+ put her in halloween dress, instantly better
[4:11:50] <graemecrackers1> a little bit of the bubbly
[4:11:51] <%ThePuddingDead> the summer dress turned out pretty cool
[4:11:52] <majindusto> WHERE IS CHEERY HANDLER?
[4:11:53] <transporterthesequel> Never forget. Or do. Actually do forget
[4:11:53] <$realm_forge> Just found a hidden set of heavy armor in that game
[4:12:03] <KoyFoster> He's not waiting? Oh no
[4:12:04] <+Estuko> where's Ara Ara Handler
[4:12:10] <%SoFarFetched> ara ara~
[4:12:16] <%mrshazboto> actually - Astral Chain is gonna take you until probably October...got a spooky game lined up you've wanted to play?
[4:12:18] <$Taisuru> Wait, did pat start a new save or something?
[4:12:26] <%Ninestempest> wat
[4:12:28] <%ThePuddingDead> beta
[4:12:29] <$Taisuru> Or is this master rank?
[4:12:42] <%Bane_Kaikyo> does it have to be rocks for any reason?
[4:12:44] <thesoldierofjoy> Ah, the famous Rock Plant
[4:12:48] <manoshake> Jagras must be pissed that even in master rank people bully him
[4:12:49] <%Ninestempest> speed eater and attack up
[4:12:52] <Quigsies> DID I JUST WATCH VORE
[4:12:54] <%Ninestempest> is all i remember seeing
[4:12:59] <%Ninestempest> @Quigsies you must be new hear
[4:13:01] <%Ninestempest> here*
[4:13:05] <Mister_McDerp> BIG VORE
[4:13:09] <%arcaderabbit48> Why. Why would a monster of this size evolve to have that specific form of consuming prey.
[4:13:11] <+Estuko> @Quigsies the first step is acceptance, you're doing great.
[4:13:14] <jaid251> Will you stream indivisible when it comes out?
[4:13:14] <haveswordmuststing> Jagras is the vore monster
[4:13:20] <KoyFoster> Whelp. See ya'll in 4 month.
[4:13:21] <%SoFarFetched> he probably will
[4:13:22] <%dekkitout> We in some real vore hours
[4:13:27] <haveswordmuststing> @arcaderabbit48 snakes do it
[4:13:27] <$Taisuru> What's GS slinger shot thing do again?
[4:13:30] <%Faustgesicht> Closest Ara ara handler was in MH4U
[4:13:30] <%TwentyCXII> OOF
[4:13:32] <+Estuko> 725 holy shit that's big.
[4:13:38] <+demon1103> ya know, Jagras may be worlds punching bag....but its really disturbing to watch it swallow animals whole
[4:13:42] <thenumberj42> AWW SHIT ITS OUT
[4:13:48] <+Estuko> @Faustgesicht she was like, big sis. Guildmarm
[4:13:51] <%arcaderabbit48> @haveswordmuststing Snakes also eat prey much msllaer than themselves, and don't have four limbs or multiple teeth
[4:14:25] <+BHPicasso> whats the GS new moves?
[4:14:26] <%Faustgesicht> @thenumberj42 Early copy for pat. Don't get excited
[4:14:27] <retrokid616> hey pat its my birthday today @AngriestPat
[4:14:29] <haveswordmuststing> @arcaderabbit48 true but you expect a Great Jagras to kill anything with those teeth and claws LUL
[4:14:34] <ravencloak13> Snakes eat things way bigger to cause they are literally a string of muscles.
[4:14:40] <%joylent_blue> FeelsBirthdayMan
[4:14:41] <%Ninestempest> great jagras does it to bring prey back to the nest and feed its young
[4:14:43] <%Anime_Flux> happy bday
[4:14:44] <thenumberj42> no it's out dude
[4:14:44] <%Ninestempest> not for itself
[4:14:45] <majindusto> Jagras is just a giant mutant Iguana lol
[4:14:48] <thenumberj42> look on your ps4 lol
[4:14:52] <+Estuko> @retrokid616 FeelsBirthdayMan <3
[4:14:54] <Mister_McDerp> FeelsBirthdayMan
[4:14:59] <%dekkitout> It's probably way more noticeable with impact mantle, but you're on GS so that mantle might be moot
[4:15:07] <%Venicilia> @Faustgesicht it did just come out tho. only you have to have the update fully installed. mines at 18/34 gb and has 3 hours left :c
[4:15:08] <retrokid616> hey chat im 28 now and thanks @Mister_McDerp
[4:15:08] <%arcaderabbit48> @haveswordmuststing That's fair. Not like he's very fast either. Honestly his biology seems more like he'd be a herbivore than anything. He's basically a really big iguana dino
[4:15:10] <ravencloak13> @haveswordmuststing *looks at Apothoh that it just unhiges it’s jaw to swallow whole and it’s stomach acid instantly kills it*
[4:15:12] <retrokid616> @Estuko
[4:15:18] <+Nomenanza> they did a good job making slinger more relevant. Pushing monsters into walls feels great
[4:15:30] <%arcaderabbit48> When did MonHun get so much vore??
[4:15:31] <%Faustgesicht> Oh. Well, I'm the fool then.
[4:15:34] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat any horror game based planes for october?
[4:15:42] <ravencloak13> @arcaderabbit48 First game.
[4:15:43] <%Venicilia> its ok, that news is only 7min old haha
[4:15:45] <manoshake> @AngriestPat you can change directions during slinger burst as well
[4:15:50] <%ThePuddingDead> devil bringer
[4:15:57] <haveswordmuststing> @arcaderabbit48 Monster Hunter World is going for a nature documentary vibe
[4:15:58] <$rdark_ksu> he seems unperturbed
[4:15:59] <thenumberj42> haha yeah finally unlocked 9 mins ago
[4:15:59] <Vermillion129> Clutch claw his stupid face Kreygasm
[4:16:01] <+Nomenanza> yeah even stone and brightmoss are useful now
[4:16:04] <%nmaten> its not just dedicated flash pods anymore?
[4:16:10] <%mrshazboto> stone is like the best in the game for greatsword
[4:16:14] <ravencloak13> @haveswordmuststing Even thought they took out the ecology videos.
[4:16:28] <brambobelurkin> crystal burst load ups
[4:16:36] <brambobelurkin> do good stun
[4:16:41] <%Ninestempest> plz no cart against great jaggy
[4:16:44] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat That's why you'd use slinger mid-combo for GS. It can flinch the monster and leave the open for a True Charge
[4:16:45] <tag545> if you slap after a tackle you can slinger again for another go
[4:16:51] <+Nomenanza> holy shit MR Odogaron armour makes you such a weeb
[4:16:54] <%ThePuddingDead> up until recently i didnt know u could shoot slinger ammo into monster already by mounting them
[4:16:58] <brambobelurkin> nice
[4:17:04] <brambobelurkin> na
[4:17:12] <majindusto> First Year with No ShitstormBibleThump
[4:17:15] <%superc37> It also comes out FASTER than the swing-tackle-true charge combo
[4:17:17] <brambobelurkin> Lance
[4:17:19] <mayorrev> what about heavy bowgun? i wanna shoot shit
[4:17:22] <Vigonept> he caved the weak willed man
[4:17:24] <%TwentyCXII> But what about Gunlance with Artillery F I V E?!?
[4:17:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> *Doots Quietly alone in a corner*
[4:17:28] <%crimsonharvest> why isnt it dead
[4:17:29] <%Anime_Flux> No chance. That's what he had.
[4:17:30] <ravencloak13> @nomenanza How much more? Cause the original was just as weeb.
[4:17:30] <+demon1103> blasphemy....all hail the Doot-Doot staick!!!
[4:17:34] <%arcaderabbit48> I like the bow
[4:17:42] <%crimsonharvest> woulda been dead if you used the lance
[4:17:42] <manoshake> Damn that was a nice combo
[4:17:45] <%Venicilia> I mean, speed run wise Ledge spamming GS was literally top tier
[4:17:47] <%nmaten> "you seein this shit right?" *whiffs twice*
[4:17:50] <Vermillion129> Pat
[4:17:50] <%ThePuddingDead> its jagras...
[4:17:50] <+Nomenanza> @ravencloak13 like "arigato send me to japango" levels of weeb

[4:18:19] <%republicofu> HH is pretty rad now
[4:18:25] <kindashagg> I've been gone from this game for a while, how is the s&s?

[4:21:33] <Vermillion129> @ravencloak13 then just use HR gear
[4:21:44] <ravencloak13> Not enough atk then.
[4:21:52] <thesoldierofjoy> Go for focus- does wonders for me
[4:21:56] <ravencloak13> Armors just for atk anyway, not defense.
[4:22:00] <tag545> tenderizer is required if you are a big numbers kind of guy
[4:22:04] <%Ninestempest> >NOT tenderizer
[4:22:06] <Daniel_Is_I> Could get Tenderizer lv3 if you've got the jewels for it
[4:22:11] <ravencloak13> Cause armor in games just fucking useless as actual defense.
[4:22:13] <Vermillion129> you dont have more than lv4 atk boost in HR?
[4:22:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hunting horn the only weapon Jocat didn't shit on because its truely better then SnS
[4:22:19] <Vermillion129> seriously?
[4:22:28] <%ThePuddingDead> fortitude
[4:22:30] <butthurtdave> mirewalker
[4:22:30] <+BHPicasso> thats a lot of defense
[4:22:32] <ravencloak13> No as in the base armor has 4+ to atk just as skills.
[4:22:34] <ravencloak13> Not gems.
[4:22:53] <Vermillion129> and half gem slot

[4:25:01] <Vigonept> fuck waiting lol
[4:25:37] <+demon1103> @Nomenanza i mean its not "early" considering you have to beat base games story mode

[4:27:45] <Monkeyweed21> coral
[4:27:45] <%ThePuddingDead> too bad u cant upgrade palico armor
[4:27:48] <%goose_attack_almanac> Look at his baaaag
[4:27:54] <%arcaderabbit48> Not when you have a bow
[4:27:57] <Vigonept> SLEEP
[4:27:59] <tag545> hahaha FIX
[4:28:01] <%nmaten> use flash pod
[4:28:02] <Psyramics> i thought that was lava fish
[4:28:03] <thesoldierofjoy> Lavasioth is worse
[4:28:03] <%mrshazboto> you're gonna have a BAAAAAD time if you thought he sucked before
[4:28:03] <$Taisuru> PAOLUMU IS GREAT
[4:28:04] <$realm_forge> HE EVEN HAS A BAG
[4:28:11] <%dekkitout> Paolumu now puts your ass in a coma
[4:28:17] <$i_am_therydon> lavasioth was worse
[4:28:29] <Zombrocom> Paolumu is easy with insect glaive
[4:28:31] <Daniel_Is_I> Kirin is still the worst just because I can't fucking hit his head with DBs
[4:28:31] <+nikoloas_> paolumu was fine his gear just sucked ass
[4:28:33] <+dantejoestar21> that's a weird way of saying Arch Tempered Kushula Daora
[4:28:35] <%nmaten> AT lavasioth was a fun time
[4:28:42] <$realm_forge> Fluff bat can go fuck itself
[4:28:42] <GundamF91> honestly all the stupid fish monsters are boring and shit
[4:28:47] <ravencloak13> @arcaderabbit48 I tried with a heavy bow gun. I don’t like bow.
[4:28:47] <thesoldierofjoy> \also is the music weird for anyone else? its like Astera's radio is out of range
[4:28:51] <%goose_attack_almanac> I never killed a single LAvisoth
[4:28:54] <%goose_attack_almanac> and I'm fine iwth that
[4:28:54] <%spiritofmojave> just remember Lavasioth with his armor, and retreating all the time. he's far worse than paolu
[4:29:01] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Out of all the Frontier monsters they could have picked, it was the goddamn Magma Fish
[4:29:04] <jeffishype> wow this handler is way better
[4:29:11] <%mrshazboto> Jagras / Jagras / Kulu / Hornetaur / Hornetaur and an Attack Charm 3 is still probably best
[4:29:13] <+Nomenanza> does it have a set bonus? I havent farmed Jagras yet
[4:29:14] <ravencloak13> Lavisoth is a bitch fuck off you ran.
[4:29:14] <$i_am_therydon> wasn't the absolute worst lunastra pat?
[4:29:23] <M4eta> whats this set?
[4:29:23] <mossypebble222> i like lavisioth
[4:29:29] <%arcaderabbit48> @ravencloak13 Not a fan of heavy bowgun because, well, its heavy and it makes you slow as hell. Regular bowgun seemed kinda cool though, its just not as fast as the actual bow
[4:29:34] <Rexenexus> Lavasioth in Gen Ult is actually semi fun to fight
[4:29:41] <$Taisuru> Oh god not miasma
[4:29:42] <ravencloak13> Lunastra was bad cause she’s a bad bitch, Palumo was bad cause he’s annoying movement.
[4:29:47] <Rexenexus> he's just a cute stupid lava fish
[4:29:49] <%mrshazboto> Hope you brought energy drinks
[4:29:57] <+zaworldo> SO we're dead now right?
[4:29:58] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Paolumu was fine?
[4:29:58] <%ThePuddingDead> aerial ruffies
[4:29:59] <+Nomenanza> yeah there he be
[4:30:00] <%shockzndrawe> oh good a sleep monster
[4:30:02] <%Anime_Flux> hahahaha
[4:30:03] <+Nomenanza> the floaty fluffboi
[4:30:05] <Daniel_Is_I> I don't think he brought energy drinks
[4:30:06] <%Starlight_Gamer> what?
[4:30:09] <+nikoloas_> what a cutie
[4:30:09] <@lewdskeletor13> Ded
[4:30:10] <%ThePuddingDead> thats.....dire
[4:30:10] <Rexenexus> sugoiPunk sugoiPunk sugoiPunk
[4:30:12] <ravencloak13> @arcaderabbit48 The actually bow feels slower. Too long to charge. Dodge ain’t great either.
[4:30:15] <Vermillion129> I hope you like going to sleep
[4:30:15] <$Taisuru> Game over YEAHHHH
[4:30:16] <DraxTD> the fuck was that??
[4:30:16] <thesoldierofjoy> Did you bring energy drinks, Pat?
[4:30:16] <haveswordmuststing> ResidentSleeper
[4:30:20] <%dekkitout> ! Coma !
[4:30:20] <moosemonkey397> this feels very malfesteo
[4:30:22] <%Anime_Flux> I can't take this monster seriously, he's too cute
[4:30:27] <$realm_forge> F
[4:30:35] <tag545> oh the monster intros get pretty brutal
[4:30:36] <%ThePuddingDead> easy mode is now selectable
[4:30:39] <ravencloak13> @anime_flux He’s an asshole.
[4:30:41] <mossypebble222> i love how it just knocks your ass out and runs off
[4:30:42] <%Starlight_Gamer> so fight jigglypuff?
[4:30:44] <@lewdskeletor13> apatHat
[4:30:47] <%luckysteak> Man, malfestio was such a cool and unique fight
[4:30:49] <IncredibleMeh> I wish they had gone for the platipus version in the concept art
[4:30:51] <Vermillion129> Yes
[4:30:56] <%goose_attack_almanac> it is now behind you
[4:30:57] <Vermillion129> a black jigglypuff
[4:30:57] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat It's amazing how the Guild developed Scifi Radio Tech
[4:30:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Starlight_Gamer DARK jigglypuff
[4:31:09] <$realm_forge> That’s whatcha get for snorting fluff at powder
[4:31:17] <%arcaderabbit48> @ravencloak13 Charge builds up as you hit. You're not actually supposed to sit and charge your attack unless there is an enemy far away form you. Charge it one stage, then go in to your full combo and you climb to stage 3 naturally. At least from what I recall
[4:31:20] <%Svanyr> Look at his face!
[4:31:21] <+BoomerTiro> Developed? Or dug up?
[4:31:23] <%Svanyr> Its so cute!
[4:31:24] <%ThePuddingDead> same roar
[4:31:24] <%goose_attack_almanac> god I hate it's trajectory
[4:31:28] <%Svanyr> Now kill it!
[4:31:28] <%arcaderabbit48> Aw yeah, look at that hype palette swap!
[4:31:38] <ravencloak13> @arcaderabbit48 It has stages?
[4:31:43] <thesoldierofjoy> aaand down it goes
[4:31:43] <manoshake> put him to sleep
[4:31:44] <$realm_forge> It comes in goth!
[4:31:47] <%TwentyCXII> I assumed it was like Musou games and everyone just yelled really loud
[4:31:50] <%Anime_Flux> yeah this color patlette looks really good on it
[4:31:54] <%nmaten> hes just doing the butt stomp
[4:31:54] <Vermillion129> This guy is a bitch as soon as you bring sleep resist
[4:31:54] <%Anime_Flux> *palette
[4:31:56] <%dekkitout> Oh lord, was flash bug effect changed
[4:32:07] <%arcaderabbit48> @ravencloak13 Yep. Its been a while, but I believe there is 2 levels of charge?
[4:32:15] <Daniel_Is_I> Oh no, is this the Azure Rathalos of paolumus?
[4:32:20] <%ThePuddingDead> o_o
[4:32:20] <Daniel_Is_I> Never on the ground?
[4:32:24] <%ThePuddingDead> woah
[4:32:25] <%Anime_Flux> barrel roll?
[4:32:33] <haveswordmuststing> instead of a max amount of flashes used in a fight, they now have resistance the more you use them
[4:32:33] <ravencloak13> Yes, the stronger monsters get immuned to it faster cause fair, flash pods beat most of the flying ones
[4:32:36] <Vermillion129> here comes the sleep gas
[4:32:36] <@lewdskeletor13> NotLikeThis
[4:32:38] <thesoldierofjoy> Yo, wake up Diablos, see if they turf war
[4:32:43] <%Svanyr> Right into the fart gas
[4:32:43] <$Taisuru> SLEP
[4:32:44] <%ThePuddingDead> time for beddy bies

[4:32:50] <Daniel_Is_I> Did pat not eat?
[4:32:55] <%SGrim> It just dropped Barroth... in one hit. That's AMAZING PogChamp
[4:32:58] <%spiritofmojave> those are some intense fucking spins
[4:32:59] <ravencloak13> He did not.
[4:32:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Did pat not bring redbull?

[4:33:27] <%mrshazboto> Vape King Paolumu
[4:33:28] <%arcaderabbit48> So why are we fighting sleep bat again?
[4:33:30] <ravencloak13> Oh Gods it can move the sleep clouds like Chameleos moves his poison clouds.
[4:33:32] <thesoldierofjoy> Awww, Barry
[4:33:35] <%nmaten> i already hate this guy
[4:33:37] <Vigonept> energy drinks
[4:33:37] <haveswordmuststing> Hush, Barroth
[4:33:37] <%Anime_Flux> sweet dreams
[4:33:38] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Energy Drinks might be useful here
[4:33:39] <theredfox930000> hey pat
[4:33:44] <%spiritofmojave> Barroth is doing his best!
[4:33:44] <$Taisuru> PSYCHO CRUSHER
[4:33:46] <Vigonept> no this is rad!
[4:33:56] <%TwentyCXII> Gently waft the nerve gas
[4:34:02] <%Venicilia> aww, you dont roll if you sleep on a hill
[4:34:04] <thesoldierofjoy> Holy shit it is a Psycho Crusher
[4:34:07] <ravencloak13> ...Why does this look more fair and fun to me then base Palumu?!
[4:34:25] <%ThePuddingDead> ikr?
[4:34:38] <tag545> wind is annoying
[4:34:42] <%goose_attack_almanac> @ravencloak13 Paolumu is just annoying to fight. Not fun. Doesn't do anything interesting
[4:34:42] <tag545> a cloud you can avoid
[4:34:45] <$i_am_therydon> is it me or is pat dropping frames?
[4:34:51] <thesoldierofjoy> Pfffff, just a fkn orb with wings flying away LUL
[4:34:51] <%ThePuddingDead> that air suck he does before taking off, gets on my nerves
[4:34:58] <Daniel_Is_I> At least it's not AT Kushala
[4:35:01] <thesoldierofjoy> KICK IT
[4:35:04] <%goose_attack_almanac> @ravencloak13 This one moves more and has more attacks
[4:35:06] <mossypebble222> i love that he just fucking flips shit and freaks out
[4:35:10] <+demon1103> I need to stop watching pat play this.i cant double dip again...i need to be patient....but its soooo cool
[4:35:15] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat SO they turned Paolumu into a psychotic baloon
[4:35:15] <%spiritofmojave> Thousand Needles this fucko
[4:35:16] <MasterDecoder> THAT'S A DOPE PAOLUMU
[4:35:18] <ravencloak13> He floats around in weird angles, this fucker goes ape shit with it’s charge move and then makes safe areas for itself.
[4:35:19] <%mrshazboto> is breaking his face still the way to go?
[4:35:32] <sayaman012341> honestly paolumu was the lamest fight in the original version imo
[4:35:51] <ravencloak13> Yeah, Jyrratodus and Lavisioth felt better to fight.
[4:35:56] <Vigonept> theres that yian move
[4:35:58] <%TwentyCXII> Face or wings
[4:35:59] <Daniel_Is_I> Is that tail slam new?
[4:36:09] <Xiangchang> I wish there was a fist weapon for some big punches.
[4:36:12] <ravencloak13> He had a tail slam this one just does it more.
[4:36:18] <haveswordmuststing> anyone else want the Tonbas from frontier Z were back too
[4:36:21] <thesoldierofjoy> Pretty sure Pao was three star weak to stun last I checked, maybe this one is the same Pat
[4:36:33] <ravencloak13> @xiangchang Chinese MMO of this has tonfa weapon.
[4:36:37] <thesoldierofjoy> Try your tackles in his face
[4:36:40] <tag545> they needed an endgame bird wyvern
[4:36:42] <Daniel_Is_I> Yeah but Yian Garuga is cooler.
[4:36:53] <Vermillion129> Yain is here to be with his mom Rathian
[4:36:59] <%mrshazboto> Do flame pods clear out sleep goo?
[4:37:08] <Vigonept> nostalgia
[4:37:10] <tag545> its mostly from one eye yan
[4:37:10] <bendatron> nor do i
[4:37:11] <%ThePuddingDead> thats a good question
[4:37:11] <ShichiNoBushi> Ganguros?
[4:37:11] <ravencloak13> You know whose cooler then Yian Garuga? His father that fucked Rathian.
[4:37:17] <+Nomenanza> holy shit the fluff boi got new moves
[4:37:21] <%dekkitout> Yian's ear flaps looks silly
[4:37:22] <%luckysteak> Yian garuga is cooler, but infinitely less fun to fight. Those instacharges are bullcrap
[4:37:24] <sayaman012341> MH Ridley
[4:37:28] <theredfox930000> lol what is happening
[4:37:34] <ravencloak13> Then chad Yian Kutku that NTR’d Rathlos.
[4:37:37] <Daniel_Is_I> It's always bothered me that you can't cut Paolumu's tail
[4:37:38] <+Burger_Bonanza> @AngriestPat personally I like Yian Garuga because he's the only bird wyvern I've seen that's actually threatening
[4:37:39] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I can believe a Yian Kut-ku managed to fuck a Rathian.
[4:37:39] <Vermillion129> GAS GAS GAS
[4:37:46] <%ThePuddingDead> thats cool
[4:37:49] <thesoldierofjoy> Its the dragon equivalent of a Mule, exept that its a psycho chicken, whats not to like
[4:38:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> It loves to smell its own farts

[4:38:20] <ravencloak13> @seraphile Music sounds fine to me.
[4:38:20] <tag545> nice. he doesn't just make sleep clouds he can move them around
[4:38:46] <Daniel_Is_I> And if endgame sets are truly nuts you might be able to put in evade extender and HG earplugs without losing any essential dps skills
[4:38:51] <ravencloak13> He can also use his wing flaps to move the clouds not just suck in air.
[4:39:03] <ravencloak13> They gave him some of Chameleos oves.
[4:39:06] <ravencloak13> Moves*

[4:44:55] <ScreamLord> His head just refuses to break
[4:44:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol, pat just kept talking about not playing until the pc release, lol, okay
[4:45:00] <ravencloak13> Man, the fact the fixed the hitboxes this much means we can have Plesioth and he not be a fucker.

[4:45:35] <@commanderclaw> His rocky parts look like an oil spill
[4:45:42] <$Taisuru> ResidentSleeper
[4:45:43] <+Estuko> @ravencloak13 I also miss heavy rain storms in mh, remember the thunder rod and planting that under the plesioth??
[4:45:52] <butthurtdave> how has its face not broken yet
[4:46:05] <ScreamLord> Pao and Pukie always had that move
[4:46:06] <Vermillion129> Hitbox is still case by case basis, I have seen Barioth charge that have bigger hitbox than his body
[4:46:10] <Arek_1> Good trade. LUL
[4:46:16] <Ryutaryi> That speed eating, wow
[4:46:17] <ravencloak13> @estuko DUDE! Look how much they fixed the hit boxes! In the old games he would have gotten hit! Also yeah, that shit was fun. I call down LIGHTNING!
[4:46:22] <$Taisuru> Only breaks when inflated
[4:46:26] <+Nomenanza> yuppp
[4:46:40] <+Nomenanza> same deal here with Beotodus
[4:46:46] <DanielisAwesome52> Can't break regular's face unless its inflated
[4:46:47] <+Estuko> @ravencloak13 I remember my friend and I figuring out that shit LUL blowing ourselves up the first time then learning to haul ass
[4:46:49] <thesoldierofjoy> You have to hit it while its inflated, otherwise it wont break Pat
[4:46:51] <%arcaderabbit48> I cant believe its not just dead
[4:47:06] <ravencloak13> @estuko Nice, I just did it cause the game told me.

[4:47:23] <%ThePuddingDead> no more burning stamina
[4:47:31] <%Puhff> YOU CAN MOUNT NOW???
[4:47:45] <ravencloak13> The fact we can also jump attack from it is radist part.
[4:47:46] <+Estuko> I kinda missed when the monsters mounted you
[4:47:49] <+Estuko> pinned*
[4:47:50] <+Estuko> Fuck

[4:48:11] <$Taisuru> No, those are the weakness scars
[4:48:11] <+zaworldo> No it's marked
[4:48:13] <%Scrub_Seeker> @Estuko ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

[4:48:18] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat That the Tenderizing effect
[4:48:18] <%dekkitout> Monsters only mount you in the Soviet Russia localization...
[4:48:19] <haveswordmuststing> @estuko some do, you just cant dung bomb them out of the grab animation
[4:48:20] <ravencloak13> @estuko Rajangs going to give your new blood the hands soon.
[4:48:21] <+Estuko> NotLikeThis did I expose myself.
[4:48:34] <+Grayhammatter> nice whiff bud
[4:48:34] <+AllenDeadman> big coward
[4:48:35] <Arek_1> Yeah, it was tenderized.
[4:48:52] <ravencloak13> I barely get pinned so I also forget they can pin you still in this game.
[4:49:00] <+Pookiedaexzile> how bad cpuld rajang be
[4:49:01] <ravencloak13> I got pinned by Rath like, once.
[4:49:01] <+Estuko> @ravencloak13 LUL I've fought that fucking rajang for years.
[4:49:18] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Monsters don't go to sleep when you're in the same general area anymore
[4:49:22] <%Fidranth> rajang made me put down 4, lol
[4:49:25] <ravencloak13> They made Rajang bigger in this game.
[4:49:44] <thesoldierofjoy> !POISONED!
[4:49:44] <+BHPicasso> are there any new character customization options?
[4:49:45] <thenumberj42> rajang is fucking terrifying now
[4:49:45] <ravencloak13> Cause apparently that’s a nerf when something is that strong and moves that much but is the size of Kirin.
[4:49:47] <haveswordmuststing> @ravencloak13 twice as big, so he's half as dangerous Kappa
[4:50:10] <ravencloak13> Which to be fair yeah but also... man the boulders going to be HUGE now...
[4:50:18] <tag545> give a vespoid the speed and power of kirin
[4:50:18] <ravencloak13> Also grabs.
[4:50:21] <$Taisuru> @haveswordmuststing It's weird but it's true, big rajang will be so much nicer to fight
[4:50:22] <+Estuko> the fucking super high level Savage Deviljho was a bitch in MH4U but that armour Kreygasm that was good shit
[4:50:25] <+Papafleish> have you hunted barioth yet?
[4:50:26] <+AllenDeadman> he succ
[4:50:34] <%goose_attack_almanac> yet
[4:50:46] <+Grayhammatter> he don't want to
[4:50:52] <%Anime_Flux> Paolumu will not be humbled
[4:50:53] <@commanderclaw> Shoulda brought a ranged weapon
[4:50:53] <Vigonept> energy drinks. baby
