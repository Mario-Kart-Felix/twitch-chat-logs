[0:05:06] <T_Sasquatch> @expressnode so 1.0 ?
[0:05:12] <thecrazyestminer> @terpanderlux Bro what kinda copium you huffing
[0:05:32] <%blackmageslowpoke> 1.0 classic would not be goated, it would be woated
[0:05:33] <%Dakuu75> @Daxalog he was streaming Horizon 2 late last night, till like midnight or 1am. other than that, I don't see a VoD from today
[0:05:34] <%jackythefrost> @beencheffin As someone who played 1.X back in the day OH IT WOULD NOT
[0:06:01] <$Kevlar_Caviar> also when the FUCK are they gonna put kuja in ff14
[0:06:04] <fluffyesttail> This live letter, remeber: it is live
[0:06:09] <valriot> Man i get people wanting bad Destiny 2 content back, but anyone after FFXIV 1.0 is a psycho
[0:06:09] <ExpressNode> @T_Sasquatch Naww I'm talking FF7 pop-eye
[0:06:19] <%jackythefrost> I dont want to deal with something as awful as 1.X's Fatigue system ever again
[0:06:23] <+polothegreatest> FF14? Sign me up. plagueBell
[0:06:23] <$Kevlar_Caviar> or yknow, acknowledge kuja at all outside of dissidia
[0:06:27] <seer0ftime> @Kevlar_Caviar castlevania happened
[0:06:29] <$Kevlar_Caviar> does he even have merch?
[0:06:30] <%RealThiele> this live letter is about past 6.1 and beyond iirc
[0:06:46] <%JoshManVGH> @jackythefrost Oh no, what was "Fatigue?
[0:06:53] <ExpressNode> Man I spent the whole day reading light novels which is rare for me
[0:06:54] <thecrazyestminer> @valriot You mean destiny 2 content in general
[0:06:57] <%JustToWatch> JustToWatch subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Pat help me I'm playing Horizon and keep trying to do Sifu dodges and parries
[0:06:58] <calboku> it's not gonna be 6.1 specific, they're gonna talk about the next 10 years
[0:06:59] <sirtommygunn> wasnt the fatigue system just the rested system but framed in the opposite way?
[0:07:01] <disflipmat> I don't know how feasible it would be, but I'd love to see something where like, you can just insert your WoL and watch yourself in the 1.0 cutscenes and that's it. I don't think anyone needs to actually play it again
[0:07:02] <qwertusxuz> we gotta get that "adventurer" storyline
[0:07:12] <seer0ftime> afaik this ll is an endwalker wrapup/question/answer
[0:07:13] <tanarath> Does destiny 1 still exist @valriot?
[0:07:27] <sirtommygunn> as in "you played too much now you get half exp" instead of "you get twice as much exp when rested"
[0:07:32] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Shoot the gun Paige
[0:07:33] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I only come for the intro lol

[0:10:17] <+VivalaDragoon> Cheer500 Hey Pat just to let you know there are rumors that the PC version of Elden Ring has some stuttering (collaborated by Lance Mcdonald, the Bloodborne 60 fps fan-patch guy). Also people are theorizing it's due to "shader compilation", I don't know what that means or why people think that, I'm just letting you know because I know you're planning to get it on PC and you like your framerate stuff.
[0:10:17] <@TheYellowcouch> Un-spaghetti the game
[0:10:22] <orbulon> HIEN ROBES
[0:10:26] <@ssjklyco> Just keep it the same tbh. It can't look worst than WoW
[0:10:26] <%TerpanderLux> monkaS
[0:10:30] <tanarath> Given  that it's literally a part of the purchase to do that, the old content should come back, hopefully they'll not create tech debt in the future.
[0:10:34] <%JustToWatch> idk one guy sounds pretty legit
[0:10:39] <%Dakuu75> guys... don't EVEN argue with Pat about ANYTHING FFXIV related. he knows everything.
[0:10:40] <fluffyesttail> HROTHGAR BOOBA TIME??
[0:10:40] <valriot> @tanarath Pc servers for 1 is rough cos its a full game port, they didnt even put it on PS5, but yeah the old content would be cool revamped, dont disagree with that

They've subscribed for 18 months! wow, 18 months of slime! what a concept! this truly was the patstaresat! also paige's excitement for the definitely-not-happening ff9 remake is totally warranted, i love all the characters in that game (especially kuja, 100% most underrated ff villain)
[0:21:15] <%Ziegsy> No plans on ff14 nfts from the mans mouth itself

[0:24:01] <%ThirdWelles> What's the name  of the world in Elden Ring again?
[0:24:03] <%YakumoYomi> I get that. I tried playing Lost Ark today, and I just thought "Nah...I wanna play Elden Ring"
[0:24:05] <%greencapps> That's me but Xenoblade 3
[0:24:08] <%ThirdWelles> I keep on wanting to say Boletaria but that's wrong
[0:24:09] <MrDrayko> the Souls Mods are helping me a lot
[0:24:13] <%Dakuu75> and then she goes "you want some mc'donalds?" and pat goes "I want nuggies."

[0:24:30] <%SaiyanShoto> I’m just playing KOF until Elden Ring so I’m good

[0:24:37] <%BinaryFireball> 60+?
[0:24:38] <%Aeoneth> Do a FF6 playthrough to tide over next week
[0:24:39] <fluffyesttail> 0kay I'm done pooping goodbye Pat
[0:24:40] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Dex builds with actual jumps and crouching is going to be sick!
[0:24:40] <+izanagi22> Absurdly long
[0:24:41] <%SaiyanShoto> I hope it’s like 3 hours
[0:24:41] <%ThirdWelles> we talking 80+?
[0:24:41] <SaltyAzteca> With DOZENS of SWAMPS 4Head
[0:24:42] <%SvenHolgersson> LONGER THAN DYING LIGHT 2???!?!?!?!?!?!
[0:24:43] <%Treuan> Fucked up if true
[0:24:49] <sirtommygunn> not too many short open world games these days
[0:24:49] <%senorpapel> elden ring is only 5 hours
[0:24:49] <%RetroCop87> Pat, over/under on you getting huge off-stream?
[0:24:50] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt how long is really long?
[0:24:51] <%Dakuu75> I can't believe Samurai is gonna be a fucking starting class. I'm so hyped
[0:24:51] <+DinnerCalzone> I've discovered the joy of crafting macros in 14, so I'll be able to make high quality stuff while watching this live letter
[0:24:52] <%RealThiele> oops all swamps
[0:24:52] <DynzelWashington> I think you might be on to something there.
[0:24:52] <%TerpanderLux> no one will finish it
[0:24:55] <%BinaryFireball> 80+?
[0:24:56] <Ipsenscastle> hmm
[0:24:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> @thecrazyestminer Right??
[0:24:58] <dan_g_v> maybe it's short and you can go back to horizon XD
[0:24:58] <some_brave_apollo> it took a long time to make
[0:24:58] <MrDrayko> Hype
[0:24:59] <Shin_goob> it can probably be speed ran right out the gate
[0:24:59] <neraren> Im taking 2 weeks off man, it better be
[0:25:00] <%SmiteKnight> How would you know that, Pat???
[0:25:02] <@TheYellowcouch> Big game
[0:25:03] <%YakumoYomi> @disflipmat I see what you did there.
[0:25:04] <some_brave_apollo> stands to reason
[0:25:05] <whimwhisp> I'm not even going to play it when it comes out XD I'd rather wait for the usual early game patches to come through. Other wise it's a good way to trip over getting your build nerfed.
[0:25:09] <%greencapps> A "guess"
[0:25:10] <%AsherCaelum> Patrick "I will not violate the NDA" Boivin, you are being too coy.
[0:25:11] <%Bailey__Gaming> Super Long but still speed run
[0:25:13] <Shiranui24> what's long? just got here
[0:25:15] <%JGardner03> Probably DS3 lenght if you beeline it , but 500 hours for completion lmao
[0:25:16] <%demiiluna> If you're going to play FF6, play Brave New World Mod with the Vanilla Dialogue. The best experience I've had with a final fantasy game's combat.
[0:25:17] <%UltraViolet371> monkaS
[0:25:18] <%BinaryFireball> well damn
[0:25:18] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat lies like Andrew Garfield lol
[0:25:19] <%ThirdWelles> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh fuck yeah
[0:25:20] <+Klobarok> @PatStaresAt Im so excited to play it man. Its going to be great! What build do you think you are going to be going for your first run?
[0:25:22] <@PeachSaliva> Long as these nuts
[0:25:22] <robobeau> Yoshi P said "No NFTs"
[0:25:30] <%TechTurtle7> except there's that one part that cuts in half
[0:25:30] <Ipsenscastle> not necessarily a fan of that
[0:25:30] <%TerpanderLux> moon2W
[0:25:31] <Shiranui24> oh ER?
[0:25:32] <MrDrayko> nailing it, Peach
[0:25:33] <+PavlovianTic> looking forward to those lore videos
[0:25:36] <dan_g_v> do a branch and pot lid rum in 5 minutes @patstaresat
[0:25:37] <%JustToWatch> ok so Pat isn't playing it but he has a friend who is
[0:25:38] <%Ziegsy> restarting
[0:25:38] <+DrFacilier> i just hope it has the same versatility with builds that ds2 had
[0:25:41] <ZawaAmaz> nobody will know the convoluted ending routes
[0:25:43] <%RealThiele> paige confirmed big and strong nuts
[0:25:45] <%ThirdWelles> paige stop adding weights to your nuts they're too long
[0:25:45] <%Cjjb1995> Good one Paige!
[0:25:49] <%SmiteKnight> BIG INFORMED GUESS
[0:25:50] <%TerpanderLux> they cancelled the stream
[0:25:56] <%ReugaLive> I feel crazy, because I thought from soft came out and said the main story of elden ring was only 30 hours.
[0:25:57] <%legendfather_of_giants> yeah YoshiP said no NFT's
[0:25:58] <@PeachSaliva> Wouldn’t it be crazy if I had a copy and Pat didn’t
[0:25:59] <%MegadBlitz> nice nuts
[0:26:01] <@PeachSaliva> That would be crazy
[0:26:03] <%TerpanderLux> moon2W
[0:26:05] <%LilyaFatal> Yoshi-P said no NFTs in XIV, but he's interested in talking about the tech
[0:26:07] <%RealThiele> guessing with his special eyes
[0:26:08] <%Cjjb1995> stuttering deez nutz
[0:26:09] <@PeachSaliva> Boy oh boy
[0:26:12] <%BinaryFireball> so crazy
[0:26:13] <+StabbityStyle> yoshi-p said no nfts in 14, but maybe they'll do some sort of nft project down the line and everyone rightfully dunked on em for it
[0:26:16] <%lofiwarlock> lofiwarlock subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! 
[0:26:17] <valriot> Its a FromSoftware game, stuttering is expected
[0:26:17] <psilent_p> @patstaresat  what are your expectations for the LL
[0:26:17] <Astrophizz> performance issues in a From Soft game?!
[0:26:22] <%TechTurtle7> that would be crazy paige
[0:26:23] <%JustToWatch> I actually also heard those rumors
[0:26:30] <%Dakuu75> @PeachSaliva he might leave you over something like that. (but, he'd come back)
[0:26:36] <+PavlovianTic> it'll be fine
[0:26:38] <Blank9> I hate compiling shaders
[0:26:48] <SaltyAzteca> Like mine :)
[0:26:49] <%GinAndRoses> I can't believe Paige got Elden Ring
[0:26:52] <+DrFacilier> @Astrophizz ill be upset if there aint any jank in Elden Ring
[0:26:56] <Daxalog> so a 1060 6gb is a no go?
[0:26:56] <+alphonseisbest> @stabbitystyle I mean if they do, it wont be in 14 proper and that's fine for me
[0:26:57] <%ThirdWelles> Didn't paige miss the ER demo because she didn't check her email?
[0:26:57] <%SmiteKnight> You are so transparent, you're practically clear.
[0:27:00] <%rekinom> I only have a 3 1300x and a 1060, I'm fuuuuuuuucked
[0:27:02] <%ThirdWelles> Am I imagining that reality?
[0:27:03] <%RealThiele> optimization? whats that
[0:27:06] <%crimsonharvest> my guess is ass scaling and 'minimum' is gonna be startlingly good
[0:27:07] <%Dakuu75> Get ready for all the new Vaatividya videos about Elden Ring. @PatStaresAt
[0:27:09] <MrDrayko> my processor is the only thing I fear being not good enough, so i'm big afeared
[0:27:12] <Iremog> PeachSaliva Elden Ring tomorrow confirmed
[0:27:13] <neraren> I want to see a world where Paige got Elden Ring and Pat wasnt allowed to watch
[0:27:15] <%senorpapel> @GinAndRoses  I can't believe paige is in elden ring
[0:27:20] <ExpressNode> Getting console first than maybe PC down the line. I have a 3070 but I don't trust that shit
[0:27:22] <+alphonseisbest> @patstaresat how do u think it will run on ps4s and such?
[0:27:24] <+MrAristocrates> rip
[0:27:25] <%Bailey__Gaming> if my machine can run Wpr
[0:27:26] <+PirateKefka> I'm one of the lucky dozen in the world who has a PS5 and that was the easiest decision of "PC or Console" I've had
[0:27:29] <%barrakuta371> LUK
[0:27:29] <%TheHateFish> @rekinom That trying to run Elden Ring is a goddamned fire hazard
[0:27:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> in-game announcement for the LL just went out

[0:28:01] <%ThirdWelles> That's not too surprising, given that it's running on the DS3 engine
[0:28:04] <@TheYellowcouch> shocker

[0:52:10] <%JGardner03> It's a shame I wasn't able to experience 1.0 but I didn't even know mmo's existed lol
[0:52:23] <Kravus> @cobalt_phoenix_ in 1.0 there were flower pots in the city that had more pixels than a player character and would cause unbearable lag
[0:52:24] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Dakuu75 ff14 1.0 players got a goobue mount in ARR tho
[0:52:30] <%Kevlar_Caviar> so i mean... kinda worth it
[0:52:37] <%tusk102> IF YOU HAVE A 1.0 TATTOO UR RAD
[0:52:42] <Novusuna> It sure was unique. Sometimes there's a reason why nobody else makes a game like that.
[0:52:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Kravus lmao what the actual fuck
[0:52:43] <+jyeowa> LUL i knew it
[0:52:44] <%UltraViolet371> 1.0 got Bungied
[0:52:53] <gespenst25> nightmare
[0:52:53] <@commanderclaw> Aging is just IRL sunsetting
[0:52:55] <Zeldrick> I really like the party list in the 1.0 HUD bullshot, tbh
[0:52:58] <+alphonseisbest> Oh Gawd DESTINT MIND GOBBOS
[0:53:00] <+Moaradin> o/
[0:53:00] <%DianaTheAscian> Does it trigger destiny flashbacks
[0:53:01] <%ThirdWelles> "We're sunsetting the old aggro system"
[0:53:02] <+gustavozxd> isn't there story stuff that's important in 1.0? Even if they just did a cutscene collection or SOMETHING I would be fine with it
[0:53:02] <%tusk102> god i wish
[0:53:02] <+polothegreatest> Vaulted
[0:53:03] <MechanizedGentleman> I joined in 2.5
[0:53:04] <%Ziegsy> o/
[0:53:04] <UberWolfman> o/ 1.0 :)
[0:53:05] <%MegadBlitz> raise your hands chat
[0:53:06] <RyuuAoi> Lay down, Pat. Get comfy.
[0:53:07] <28moogles> tbh there was good stuff in 1.0 if you were into classic MMOs like XI but for every good thing there were five bad.
[0:53:07] <+Bawbjohnson> i have
[0:53:09] <%TerpanderLux> never me :)
[0:53:11] <%tusk102> i want the fucking tattoo so bad
[0:53:11] <Burncoat> I have nothing but respect for 1.0 players
[0:53:12] <@QueequegTheater> EZ Clap
[0:53:12] <VioletRosefall> 1.0 players also got a permanent discount to their sub price
[0:53:12] <+Talimity> i installed 1.0 and promptly quit LUL
[0:53:12] <%sonuke_draws> o/
[0:53:13] <Bathezid> :)
[0:53:14] <+SilverObi> they did do an amazing job righting what they could in 1.0 but it proved unsaveable
[0:53:15] <Tennochief> Same
[0:53:18] <%Birdigalore> I wish I had honestly
[0:53:19] <%DianaTheAscian> 4.55 for me
[0:53:19] <%jackythefrost> ME
[0:53:20] <%barrakuta371> arcast1Wave
[0:53:20] <@QueequegTheater> Not me lmao
[0:53:21] <flatcapgame> "show your hands if you played since 1.0. ok, why?"
[0:53:27] <Macguffn> We're sunseting the riders
[0:53:27] <+jerkhov> 5.2
[0:53:28] <%tusk102> @Burncoat especially ones still playing
[0:53:32] <tanarath> At least Vaulting in Warframe is temporary
[0:53:32] <%RealThiele> yea 1.0 was competing with TBC/WotLK oof
[0:53:36] <Novusuna> Like 90% of the important story stuff from 1.0 that hasn't been retconned or dropped is recapped somewhere in ARR
[0:53:38] <FstSergeant8595> I started in 2.1
[0:53:39] <%d1stantutopia> I started in 5.3 lmao
[0:53:43] <@TheYellowcouch> Use the handrails, Yoshi P needs you
[0:53:43] <servbotphil> Thousands of dollars
[0:53:43] <Tennochief> 5.4
[0:53:44] <orbulon> I wish I had the sick back tattoo
[0:53:50] <kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Why did the Lalafel quit being a Culinarian? THE STEAKS WERE TOO HIGH
[0:53:53] <%tusk102> "we're sunsetting arr"
[0:53:58] <%Ziegsy> I played 1.0 quite late. then rejoined in the closed beta
[0:54:01] <Shin_goob> i started almost a year ago lol
[0:54:02] <+teh_rawk> did pat play 1.0?
[0:54:06] <MechanizedGentleman> @kainhighwind1990 hehehe
[0:54:09] <Nurdock> Lived that 3.0 life!
[0:54:10] <+PkSilent01> God I was 11 when XIV came out
[0:54:11] <+pectusumbra> @kainhighwind1990 Mad Because Small
[0:54:13] <%Dakuu75> @kainhighwind1990 god damn you...
[0:54:15] <%Ziegsy> @kainhighwind1990 ziegsyWut
[0:54:16] <Stonebeard> i played once in 1.0 then got in the arr alpha
[0:54:20] <+Jungos60> I still have the 1.0 collectors edition xD
[0:54:23] <%Kevlar_Caviar> can we all agree that the ending cutscenes for 1.0/opening for ARR is like, the sickest fucking shit?
[0:54:24] <$Trenr> wait hold up, they're going over the history of 1.0 -> 2.0, does that mean they're doing another rework for 7.0?
[0:54:25] <%RealThiele> they could crunch most ARR stuff into 1-30
[0:54:26] <+izanagi22> 1.0 seemed wild from what I heard in the Noclip doc
[0:54:26] <flatcapgame> wow what a trerible friend lol
[0:54:28] <+alphonseisbest> Do u wish u played 1.0?
[0:54:30] <kainhighwind1990> What is a Red Mage's favorite cell phone provider?
[0:54:33] <dybia> I played a thaumaturge on the beta, but never touched it again until you started shilling for it a few months before HW and then I got hooked.
[0:54:33] <kainhighwind1990> Verizon
[0:54:37] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt do you wish you did for the mount, tattoo, and sub discount?
[0:54:42] <@QueequegTheater> Now who's the fool
[0:54:45] <%Dakuu75> they need to remake FFXI
[0:54:49] <kainhighwind1990> What is a Scholar's favorite cell phone provider? SPRINT
[0:54:51] <gespenst25> I thought it looked fine and would have played it but I only had a laptop...kind of dodged a bullet there
[0:54:53] <kaylenkross> I did and it was shiiiiiiit
[0:54:56] <FstSergeant8595> Pat was still enjoying his time with Lightning back then Kappa
[0:54:57] <+alphonseisbest> @trenr no, just revisiting history
[0:55:00] <%Ziegsy> @kainhighwind1990 i will sunder you
[0:55:02] <%jackythefrost> @Trenr They are going over the whole history of XIV up to this point
[0:55:04] <%RealThiele> remade FFXI is eureka/bozja
[0:55:07] <%JGardner03> lvl 30 praetorium easy
[0:55:22] <+alphonseisbest> THATS WHY 2.0 CODE IS FUCKED
[0:55:27] <+Setsuna_seiei> I played the beta on PS3 and made it to the end of ARR then dropped it because I was a broke jobless kid as heavenward was coming out
[0:55:31] <+alphonseisbest> IT WAS WRITTEN BY 6 DUDES
[0:55:33] <%VivalaDragoon> Cheer500 Goddammit Twitch, I thought you were supposed to be able to send a message when you subscribe. Anyways Pat, Lance Mcdonald talks about the stuttering in the clip "we lost" on his Twitch channel. Anyways did you hear about the official Elden Ring / Redbull collaboration stream tomorrow?

[0:55:59] <flatcapgame> oh you started when the game actually got good
[0:56:02] <+teh_rawk> 1.0 felt like some weird middle point between wow and 11
[0:56:02] <%MegadBlitz> your animated self points up left and right
[0:56:08] <ohno58> This is a nice recap episode. Now we need the beach episode.
[0:56:08] <livi242> I started in 2017
[0:56:09] <%RealThiele> 2.4 gang
[0:56:19] <livi242> cuz of you talking about it on the podcast actually
[0:56:21] <%Monkeyweed21> dps queues were BAD in 2.4 lol
[0:56:25] <kainhighwind1990> What do you call an Ascian comedian? Hahabrea
[0:56:30] <Tennochief> I started playing once I started listening to the Trial music
[0:56:30] <%tusk102> i started at 5.1
[0:56:31] <%TerpanderLux> he knows
[0:56:32] <%JGardner03> Started in August shortly after 2.2
[0:56:33] <flatcapgame> gief is the streamer now
[0:56:34] <%UltraViolet371> he's adapting, incredible
[0:56:36] <Tennochief> specifically, Oblivion
[0:56:37] <%Dakuu75> @teh_rawk that's exactly when that happened. yes.
[0:56:39] <%Wallabri> he has THINGS to SAY
[0:56:46] <@TheYellowcouch> anti dognology
[0:56:49] <+Setsuna_seiei> @teh_rawk I would say it was alot of 11 without being11 and 2.0 is when it got alot like WOW for the bettee
[0:56:53] <%TerpanderLux> monkaS
[0:56:57] <%tusk102> @kainhighwind1990 what do you call the noise ascians make when soaking wet? emet squelch
[0:56:58] <Longlius> started in the last patch of Stormblood, like a week before Shadowbringers launched
[0:56:59] <+alphonseisbest> I started with HW launch
[0:57:02] <%Dakuu75> put that asian-difficulty level in there
[0:57:03] <%jackythefrost> I LOVE this rendition of Endwalkers theme
[0:57:05] <+jerkhov> a4s poopoo

[0:57:19] <%Ziegsy> PEPSI MAN ziegsyWut
[0:57:21] <gespenst25> Second coil savage... nightmare
[0:57:21] <tanarath> Zangief is too powerful
[0:57:22] <%Monkeyweed21> judgement nisi bb
[0:57:23] <penitentpendant> Gordian = 1 death means a wipe
[0:57:25] <Nurdock> A3S was pretty fun though!
[0:57:26] <%Rumbutt> Pepsiman...
[0:57:26] <+PMAvers> Yoshi cracks his knuckes, "you want hard? You get it.":
[0:57:27] <valriot> Gordias wasnt even hard mechanically, it was just broken and the gear requirement was OOF
[0:57:30] <Nurdock> A4S can go straight to MMO hell
[0:57:31] <+alphonseisbest> @jackythefrost DUDE ALL EW IS GOATED
[0:57:33] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Also it was tuned for higher gear levels iirc
[0:57:38] <%DianaTheAscian> how broken?
[0:57:38] <+alphonseisbest> Music that is
[0:57:48] <kainhighwind1990> What is an Ascian's robe made out of? EMET SILK
[0:57:49] <%jackythefrost> @kainhighwind1990 Gordias almost killed XIV's raiding community
[0:57:57] <%RealThiele> P3S "easy" LUL
[0:58:11] <Fallacyxiii> A3S was gear gated
[0:58:14] <%Dakuu75> and then players were like, "Wait Yoshi P, what's the safe word?!" and there wasn't one.
[0:58:17] <+alphonseisbest> bad shot
[0:58:21] <flatcapgame> japense game industry .jpg
[0:58:23] <penitentpendant> @DianaTheAscian At least numerically, if even one person died it was already a wipe because you couldn't catch up damage wise
[0:58:24] <@TheYellowcouch> Too busy carrying the show
[0:58:29] <kainhighwind1990> What kind of car does the Warrior of Light drive? A SCION
[0:58:31] <%tusk102> @Dakuu75 "dont die"

[0:59:10] <@QueequegTheater> @RealThiele P3S took about a day for world first, Titania took like 37 days

[0:59:33] <%RealThiele> @RealThiele oh jeez
[0:59:35] <KaiserMario> look guys, its the pre pandemic years
[0:59:39] <%Ziegsy> who else remembers the enterprise's short stint as a submarine in ala mhigo?
[0:59:39] <FstSergeant8595> I completely skipped the Raubahn EX line and got in almost right at the beginning
[0:59:45] <+alphonseisbest> @kainhighwind1990 boo... slows claps boooo
[0:59:47] <Tennochief> @QueequegTheater I hope you Titan sits on your face
[0:59:53] <%senorpapel> @QueequegTheater  wait, titania took that long to kill?
[0:59:53] <Astrophizz> @kainhighwind1990 thought it was more than 14 :p
[0:59:54] <+izanagi22> It's still crazy to actually consider just how many people actually play this game, or at least are registered
[0:59:56] <MrDrayko> THE GREAT EXODUS
[1:00:01] <KaiserMario> and now... covid
[1:00:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> at least 100
[1:00:03] <@QueequegTheater> @RealThiele And then A3S and A4S nearly killed the raiding scene permanently
[1:00:05] <Iremog> 12 billion active subs
[1:00:06] <+alphonseisbest> @sleepers1mulant NO NFTS IN FF14 CONFIRMED
[1:00:06] <Tennochief> @QueequegTheater sorry, wrong person
[1:00:10] <kainhighwind1990> @alphonseisbest Why do Au Ra make such good musicians? THEY'RE FAMILIAR WITH THEIR SCALES
[1:00:14] <Tennochief> that was for @kainhighwind1990
[1:00:18] <+alphonseisbest> it was around 1.4mil last I looked
[1:00:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @QueequegTheater Titania took so long because everyone was new to the game and had no idea how to optimize, not to mention competitive statics were still forming
[1:00:21] <%sleepers1mulant> @alphonseisbest thank fuck
[1:00:21] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt we know daily player count is around 3.5 mill at least
[1:00:21] <+JohnRSoviet> the 5 million jump
[1:00:26] <%asgard147> limesHmm I see
[1:00:27] <%Monkeyweed21> twintania

[1:01:32] <%tusk102> i didnt mean for that to be a link
[1:01:35] <%rekinom> What's the difference between a Scholar and a Red Mage? A scholar is well read and a red mage is, well, red
[1:01:36] <Longlius> yoshida cares about wow more than wow's current devs
[1:01:40] <arkv01> how much did asmongold bring to the fold
[1:01:55] <gespenst25> thanks Paul Marketing
[1:02:00] <+alphonseisbest> @longlius yes... sadly

[1:04:43] <FstSergeant8595> Pat you were close during the "Close the Distance" moment
[1:04:44] <+izanagi22> I think I prefer 5.3's ending, but EW still had some fantastic moments
[1:04:47] <%Nobrev> should have cried on camera so we could cry together
[1:04:49] <NanoHologuise> which do you think hit stronger, 5.3 or EW?
[1:04:49] <+JohnRSoviet> Soken destroyed my tearducts with that music
[1:04:49] <@TheYellowcouch> Many liquids were spilt at that ending
[1:04:50] <+alphonseisbest> Venat <3 TT

[1:04:57] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> I remember getting to the Endwalker quest and just started overflowing
[1:04:58] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Cry for us Pat. We cry too. It is big manly to cry on stream
[1:05:03] <%real_life_ghost> I didn't anticipate Uranger unhinging his jaw and consuming the WoL in the manner of a serpent.
[1:05:03] <TheAntiNihilist> @arkv01 I don't think he's dead. he got separated along with thr shards of the world so there's a version of him in each shard presumably
[1:05:04] <Laecerelius> oh man the Close the Distance moment almsot wrecked me

[1:09:56] <+Kango234> Not enough people can find PS5s for them to leave it any time soon
[1:10:06] <+Double_Tap_That> I'd like some better body models.
[1:10:06] <%RonaldMcDownload> MORE CAT AND BUNNY HATS
[1:10:08] <Macguffn> Give me Hrothgar Mommy Milkers!!!
[1:10:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BETTER
[1:10:21] <+jerkhov> trust in old expansions probably
[1:10:22] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[1:10:24] <kainhighwind1990> That is Thancred
[1:10:25] <+2DSuperiority> it will now be turn based
[1:10:26] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> I bet this is connected to the Squadrons rework they mentioned
[1:10:26] <%ThirdWelles> "MORE VIDEO GAME"
[1:10:26] <+golguin1> EVEN BETTER lets go
[1:10:26] <+redpotato444> Oh theyre gonna make it better, I was worried they were gonna make it worse
[1:10:26] <KahnWick> FFXIV is LITERALLY a PS3 game, im sure PS4 could handle the upgrade
[1:10:26] <%real_life_ghost> @macguffn Six of em!
[1:10:27] <Bathezid> please give us the island
[1:10:28] <+abrupt_abe> Great idea Yoshi P
[1:10:29] <%RealThiele> yea full trusts inc
[1:10:29] <Astrophizz> Full solo mode
[1:10:30] <%Monkeyweed21> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
[1:10:30] <%asgard147> limesHmm
[1:10:31] <radregice> it means the game becomes more good
[1:10:36] <+polothegreatest> TESO scaling?
[1:10:37] <%MisterTylerrr> It means playing through everything with trusts until endgame
[1:10:38] <%cvp5127> alone Pog
[1:10:39] <+tsamxxx> back to eureka plz
[1:10:41] <$Spadoinkle> Now is it gonna allow players to roll in straight to 7.0?
[1:10:41] <%DianaTheAscian> Give me a hat plz...
[1:10:41] <%ElkRiverDog> More trusts?
[1:10:42] <%TheHateFish> These are high concepts, not concrete things
[1:10:44] <%RealThiele> TRUST EVERYTHING
[1:10:46] <KenzBurp> probably more trusts and stuff
[1:10:47] <penitentpendant> Now to squint at every picture to see if a Female Hrothgar is hidden in one of them
[1:10:48] <@TheYellowcouch> This is the squadron thing they were hinting at
[1:10:54] <Laecerelius> OOPS, ALL TRUSTS
[1:10:57] <+Moaradin> full trust is something they definitely said they want to do
[1:10:59] <disflipmat> KAIJU
[1:11:01] <%Dakuu75> I tried using trusts ONCE when I unlocked it and NEVER used them again. shit took 3 times as long to beat
[1:11:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> TRUST EX, TRUST SAVAGE, TRUST ULTIMATE
[1:11:05] <disflipmat> at least I hope I misheard that
[1:11:07] <RaidenRising> dem trusts
[1:11:11] <Wolfstriker121> all trusts!!!!
[1:11:14] <+PMAvers> Maybe finally time to go through and clean up some of the old content.
[1:11:14] <%sleepers1mulant> full trusts would be pog as a solo player
[1:11:15] <flatcapgame> make it so we literally never have to play with another person
[1:11:21] <%cvp5127> gaymers
[1:11:27] <Laecerelius> I mean full trusts just future proofs the game so even if it dies you could still play it in some sort of offline mode
[1:11:29] <+BIumen> Can you imagine if they release the whole first story arc as a regular JRPG
[1:11:31] <RaidenRising> trust ultimate
[1:11:31] <MKII> antisocial humans rejoice you can play with bots
[1:11:32] <Novusuna> I do like doing my first run of a dungeon with trusts
[1:11:33] <+golguin1> GAMERS RISE UP now
[1:11:33] <%RealThiele> also squadron in open world would be cool
[1:11:34] <+Moaradin> @Dakuu75 they improved trusts in endwalker. A good group of players will always be better obviously, but trust ai is pretty good
[1:11:36] <Wolfstriker121> its happening ....trust raiding for good
[1:11:37] <$Spadoinkle> Gee mares.
[1:11:38] <%radda343> I like trusts, also I'm not impatient and like to enjoy the ride
[1:11:42] <+jerkhov> loud piss
[1:11:43] <%cvp5127> gimme bots
[1:11:45] <+alphonseisbest> @dakuu75 their still nice to have for first timing msq
[1:11:50] <+SilverObi> trusts are hitting completion times beating some players now, they can do w2w while players refuse to
[1:11:52] <FstSergeant8595> I might actually level my healers if I could trust level them
[1:11:53] <KahnWick> New Companions other than Chocobos? Retainer companions?
[1:11:59] <%TerpanderLux> chjbDance
[1:12:02] <%RealThiele> will trusts kill the MMO
[1:12:06] <%jackythefrost> Asmond did say he wishes the game had a bit more solo content
[1:12:12] <+tsamxxx> my biggest desire is custom dyes with rgb sliders and being able to wear crafting/ gathering sets on combat classes
[1:12:17] <%Dakuu75> that's how FFXI went. everything can be beat solo with trusts now. it's actually pretty nice
[1:12:27] <KenzBurp> it's nice with dungeons with readable lore so that you don't have to skip things
[1:12:27] <%MisterTylerrr> "claim"
[1:12:30] <disflipmat> Give us bigger butts, Yoshi P
[1:12:30] <%RealThiele> yea a nice glam system would be a dream
[1:12:35] <andimustmask> @RealThiele it didnt kill 11 (that was a slow decline issue), trust support will be fine
[1:12:35] <valriot> WOOLIE MODE
[1:12:35] <Burncoat> You think in the Q&A they'll explain why there's no sun on the moon?
[1:12:39] <flatcapgame> ok but skipping 11 is valid
[1:12:47] <%TerpanderLux> yeah i hate playing this game with other people. singleplayer me up
[1:12:51] <%Dakuu75> WUT?!?!?!
[1:12:53] <Blank9> that was me until a year ago
[1:12:53] <%MisterTylerrr> No
[1:12:54] <Astrophizz> yeah
[1:12:54] <+Kuneida> Not really
[1:12:54] <%tusk102> sort of
[1:12:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no
[1:12:56] <Blank9> still skip 11
[1:12:56] <+PavlovianTic> nah
[1:12:57] <+DrFacilier> a lot
[1:12:57] <+Kango234> No
[1:12:57] <+izanagi22> Not quite
[1:12:57] <@TheYellowcouch> nah
[1:12:58] <cozmotics> would love if they somehow cleaned up the squadrons for everything pre shadowbringers, cause i didnt play the game at first bc i didnt want to play with other people, but i could convince a lot of ppl i know to play if it had more solo content
[1:12:58] <%NitronStreams> If they make it so you can do the full msq solo I might actually play it
[1:12:59] <+alphonseisbest> YEs
[1:12:59] <%bevyrage> missed nothing
[1:12:59] <%jackythefrost> @flatcapgame Nah 11 is great
[1:13:01] <+2DSuperiority> tons of die hard Dragon Quest people won't play the mmo because it's an mmo
[1:13:01] <+PMAvers> Never listen to anything that FF11 players say.
[1:13:01] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[1:13:04] <+golguin1> making it BETTER
[1:13:05] <xxshadowxx416> NO
[1:13:05] <%RealThiele> @andimustmask i agree but that is what the marketing team will gripe about
[1:13:06] <count_bob> Yes.
[1:13:07] <+DrFacilier> dammit
[1:13:08] <+PkSilent01> Making 14 single player friendly
[1:13:09] <+alphonseisbest> u did
[1:13:09] <%DianaTheAscian> 11 is free forever if you pay for it
[1:13:13] <@TheYellowcouch> it's as vague as it started
[1:13:20] <flatcapgame> they were taklking shit about people not playing 11 or 14
[1:13:21] <%ThirdWelles> remove old trash; retrieve new trash

[1:15:51] <kainhighwind1990> Wait, I'm an idiot why is this killing the MSQ roulette?
[1:15:53] <+Kango234> I thought I would miss the Praetorium, but at a certain point, easy exp just was not worth going through that 100 more times
[1:15:53] <flatcapgame> oh adding it IN 6.1-6.5, misread it
[1:15:54] <+PMAvers> Actually, wait, I just had a idea. What if we got the B-Team as trusts for the old content?

[1:17:16] <@QueequegTheater> Are they fixing Totorak
[1:17:17] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt imagine the vault with trust
[1:17:20] <%Frost_Quill> Are we gonna see Edda's bf die???

[1:17:38] <Laecerelius> Totorak fixed NEVER
[1:17:38] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the vault with haurchefant
[1:17:42] <%asgard147> That's okay yoshi, we can wait limesOk
[1:17:43] <count_bob> So wait.
[1:17:45] <dredgyboi> wait what about first time bonus for zoeys journal ?:0 it wil be sooo mich harder to get xD
[1:17:51] <%RealThiele> Livia is a T3 gaius sub on his only Alabama fans
[1:17:51] <%radda343> I wonder if they'll add story hooks for the trust characters
[1:17:59] <+Kango234> Oh wait, now I can go through all the hard mode dungeons in ARR I skipped.
[1:17:59] <+JohnRSoviet> cape westwind is safe for now
[1:18:00] <%DianaTheAscian> thats fine
[1:18:02] <%real_life_ghost> I want ocean fishing trusts
[1:18:06] <+alphonseisbest> Good, that's fine
[1:18:18] <%Aeoneth> @dredgyboi I use trials to farm that anyway
[1:18:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what about msq
[1:18:20] <+Kyma1020> I think that's fair
[1:18:22] <+VaunnGaming> this seems bad for community growth; and will definitely impact queue times
[1:18:30] <CzeekyTV> @Kango234 those aren't main scenario dungeons, probs wont get this treatment
[1:18:31] <%TerpanderLux> me :)
[1:18:36] <@TheYellowcouch> This is the biggest buff to DPS they've ever released
[1:18:38] <+tsamxxx> leveling roul needs better rewards if youre capped
[1:18:38] <%Monkeyweed21> @Kango234 trusts are only for msq required dungeons so you still have to queue for those
[1:18:41] <tanarath> @mkii they could literally do raid mechanics in that one story event in endwalker, so probably
[1:18:41] <+JohnRSoviet> so I can level black mage afterall
[1:18:44] <+alphonseisbest> MSQ ROULETTE IS STAYING BABY
[1:18:44] <%Frost_Quill> Maybe I'll actually be able to read the books and scrolls and shit in dungeons now.
[1:18:45] <+jerkhov> ms roulette dungeons is awful first time experience
[1:18:45] <%RonaldMcDownload> DPS queues will now be short as hell
[1:18:49] <%Ziegsy> oh thank god. I can do dungeons for the first time without people telling me what to do
[1:18:51] <%real_life_ghost> goodbye second chance points.

[1:19:42] <LadyWyvernne> Imagine going the whole game solo and then suddenly getting thrust into an alliance raid.
[1:19:50] <%asgard147> Yeah, that's ALOT of work
[1:19:51] <RyuuAoi> @w1ntertitan I might

[1:20:07] <+BIumen> it'll be cool to one day have estinien as a trust ally and then make a big return
[1:20:09] <%Frost_Quill> @RealThiele God yes I'd love to get something past Heavensward raids more than once a year.
[1:20:13] <+RobertWayneLewis98> randos
[1:20:14] <%radda343> the old 8man trials are cake anyway
[1:20:14] <%Monkeyweed21> @LadyWyvernne OH NO CRYSTAL TOWER IS GONNA BE EVEN WORSE ISNT IT
[1:20:17] <+Kyma1020> Makes sense. 8 ai controlled NPCs is alot and it was incredible they were able to pull it off at all
[1:20:23] <KahnWick> Trust Trials does not sound like a fun time
[1:20:25] <%DianaTheAscian> I wonder what weird personality stuff they would give the new trust stuff
[1:20:33] <%real_life_ghost> Hildebrand as a trust friend please.
[1:20:36] <Tennochief> I had a tank in Crystal tower today who wouldn't stop spinning the damn boss
[1:20:43] <disflipmat> lol could you imagine the system resources needed for 24 man raids with 23 AIs
[1:20:48] <flatcapgame> First runs of Preatorium are kind of a nightmare because of everyone running ahead
[1:20:54] <MrDrayko> Collect trusts like Triple Triad cards
[1:20:58] <%Frost_Quill> @DianaTheAscian Haurchefant jumps in front of the big attacks aimed for you ;_;

[1:22:17] <Stonebeard> this is great
[1:22:17] <%Dakuu75> are they talking like, "if someone dies in the main story, we can't use them as a trust"?
[1:22:22] <+alphonseisbest> Arenvald pls pls pls
[1:22:25] <%Monkeyweed21> Hoary doesnt join until after the Waking Sands attack right?
[1:22:26] <flatcapgame> let me joing up with yuyuhase just for the JP voice
[1:22:28] <+Kango234> That's why they gave Hoary VA in Endwalker
[1:22:29] <%Frost_Quill> @Monkeyweed21 There's a bunch of scions who get wrecked, could use some of them.
[1:22:30] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt The Boulder bros and Aenor
[1:22:35] <nevan_44> let me bring riol 😡
[1:22:37] <%NitronStreams> I cant wait to fight along side my favorite character: NPC A
[1:22:46] <$Trenr> Just give us Grand Company grunts, and make us go unlock NPC's like THE BOULDER so we can take them wherever.
[1:22:47] <%asgard147> psaBork psaGiefstare "Gimme food Mom!"
[1:22:48] <%demiiluna> wait what the fuck, he said "Hikari no Kago" which is the "Blessing of Light". Echo is "Koeru Chikara". This god damn confusion between the two powers continues.
[1:22:48] <RyuuAoi> He hangry
[1:22:49] <+JohnRSoviet> I can't wait to hear Hoary's voice lines in a dungeon
[1:22:52] <RaidenRising> boulder bros
[1:22:53] <AdmiralButtloaf> Hoary Boulder. The man who has a threesome with his brother.
[1:22:56] <Zeif00> what a big baby
[1:23:00] <+PMAvers> The B-Team *did* say they were going to check out some of the class guilds and looking to pick up some new jobs.
[1:23:02] <%BlueLunecy> They know exactly what key point they're talking about
[1:23:02] <Tennochief> @Dakuu75 something like that, people who canonically go somewhere else during certain dungeons likely won't be Trust memebrs for hose ones
[1:23:06] <%Fadedblank247> hildebrand and greg as trust members that just get you killed
[1:23:07] <+DinnerCalzone> Yeah we can't hear Giefy and Paige at all
[1:23:13] <+DinnerCalzone> Anti-dog tech works wonders
[1:23:19] <+Tucker0603> TRUSTS EVERYWHERE!!!!
[1:23:19] <+Kyma1020> wouldn't it be great to add the job trainers as trusts and you can collect them by completing job quests?
[1:23:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @AdmiralButtloaf lets be real it was prolly a spitroast
[1:23:21] <+other_badger> LUL
[1:23:32] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> You can bring Ryne in post 5.3 ShB dungeons, I dont think anyone cares about lore
[1:23:34] <+EySoyCoco> retcons for hype SeemsGood
[1:23:35] <%Ziegsy> oh god imagine cameo characters? doing a dungeon with trust and it randomly puts fucking yuffie in the party
[1:23:38] <flatcapgame> estinien refuses to join sastasha because he might get hit by a water spout
[1:23:38] <%VioletHeart> Haurchefant is bound to be your tank for the Vault.
[1:23:43] <%asgard147> That's sseems fine
[1:23:43] <%Birdigalore> How would Estinien work in the Nidhogg fight...
[1:23:43] <Stonebeard> Estinian vs Estinian (Evil)
[1:23:44] <@QueequegTheater> Estinien is already in that dungeon lmao
[1:23:48] <penitentpendant> Who want Ilberd tank in post ARR dungeons?
[1:23:54] <EternalJedi> VioletHeart rooCry
[1:23:56] <penitentpendant> Sloppeh!
[1:24:00] <+jerkhov> like hw final dungeon is solo'd canonically
[1:24:01] <+Ilpala> Drag Cid and Alphy through Stone Vigil
[1:24:04] <MrDrayko> @VioletHeart I hate and love this idea
[1:24:05] <%DianaTheAscian> ARR has so many optional dungeons
[1:24:06] <cozmotics> ilberd tank would be epic
[1:24:06] <+RobertWayneLewis98> did pat like the horizons game?
[1:24:10] <Tennochief> @Stonebeard I think you meant to say, the cooler Estinien
[1:24:12] <%amused_platypus> @VioletHeart oh no he has to repeat that over and over again
[1:24:13] <+n00burt> why not put the gentleman of light into trusts? he is much needed for this
[1:24:15] <%Bluwizard21> but how much dedicwated wam is needed?
[1:24:25] <%tusk102> NOOOO
[1:24:26] <Plughead_> AI upscaling?
[1:24:30] <+PavlovianTic> eyeballs everywhere
[1:24:31] <$Trenr> oh no
[1:24:31] <+VaunnGaming> this just seems like it'll be very jarring for new players going into Heavensward
[1:24:32] <+tsamxxx> Wait is this not a 6.1 liveletter?
[1:24:34] <%Dakuu75> @RobertWayneLewis98 yeah, he enjoyed it
[1:24:35] <Srthunda> pls no
[1:24:36] <+jyeowa> @Bluwizard21 how dare you

[1:49:18] <+transporterthesequel> They are more trapezoid than body.
[1:49:18] <flatcapgame> ok now add more particle effects to red mage LB3
[1:49:18] <HotSauceFiend> so hold up, is this game graphically intense at its current release? cause this seems much more graphical
[1:49:19] <%Frost_Quill> They had to play this music to prevent the lala from tempering everyone.

[1:51:40] <%RealThiele> up that thread count on your drip
[1:51:41] <+jerkhov> yoshi's heavy load
[1:51:48] <%asgard147> Like that Potted Plant?
[1:51:48] <Vampireinarm> remove HQ items to add HQ textures Kappa
[1:51:52] <kainhighwind1990> maybe purple colored gear will actually look decent now
[1:51:54] <+Talimity> metal looks like shit in ffxiv, everything looks like plastic
[1:51:56] <%MisterTylerrr> Make capes work like caps
[1:51:59] <@TheYellowcouch> omg that measn the first DRK swords won't look like horrible plastic
[1:52:09] <%DianaTheAscian> werid
[1:52:11] <%TerpanderLux> thats gonna be weeeeeird
[1:52:14] <%MisterTylerrr> Ooo that'll feel weird..
[1:52:15] <Laecerelius> I guess that makes sense
[1:52:16] <+teh_rawk> NEW GAME OF SPOT THE PLAYER
[1:52:18] <faldin> HD us and SD thancred
[1:52:19] <Astrophizz> will be a bit uncanny
[1:52:19] <flatcapgame> warrior of lighting
[1:52:20] <Nupinoop296> being WoL gives you hi-res privilege
[1:52:20] <@DakotaMacDoodle> oh
[1:52:21] <%Monkeyweed21> @Astrophizz yea I wouldnt be suprised if they looked into PBR given the massive improvement to material rendering for little performance cost works well for an MMO
[1:52:22] <Laecerelius> but it's gonna be awkward
[1:52:22] <Vampireinarm> crystal exarch needs it asap on that arm
[1:52:23] <+jerkhov> it already is if viera
[1:52:26] <toulon_somberjade> That won't cause any sort of dissoance
[1:52:28] <+JohnRSoviet> That's one way to designate who the main characters are
[1:52:28] <MrDrayko> fucking Harry in SH2 ending
[1:52:29] <%ThirdWelles> We'll be SO fucking pretty next to them
[1:52:29] <+Kyma1020> we're going to be a golden god to them XD
[1:52:32] <Estuko> Get your photo with your favorite NPCS while you can!!
[1:52:32] <%RealThiele> so yea in 6.X some SHINY FUCKER is gonna show upnew NPC
[1:52:33] <Blank9> the Blessing of Light
[1:52:33] <%senorpapel> high rez miqote talking to lo rez ysh
[1:52:34] <UberWolfman> Ahhh the YAKUZA face Lift
[1:52:35] <%Aeoneth> Go find your low res doppleganger in the world
[1:52:37] <karl_rex> Protagonist vs background characters
[1:52:38] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You'll know the important characters like it's a Yakuza game
[1:52:41] <androalfus> warrior of lighting LUL
[1:52:43] <+justianxix> that might be a bit weird
[1:52:45] <flatcapgame> one bringers shaders, one brings lighting
[1:52:46] <$insaneintentionsyo> it's mah birthday insane120Skelegasm
[1:52:48] <%d1stantutopia> you can look at a horrible, low-poly mess and confidently go "this is Thancred"
[1:52:49] <Greetings_Gentlemen> some FFX upgrade schtick
[1:52:51] <Vermillion129> At least do it for dragoon estinien and aymeric please
[1:52:52] <Ryan1016> LOL
[1:52:52] <+JohnRSoviet> "You must be the WoL, I can tell by how much higher resolution you are"
[1:52:54] <%tusk102> LMAO
[1:52:55] <$Trenr> perfect
[1:53:04] <nevan_44> hahaha why are you so lowres thancred
[1:53:04] <Astrophizz> lol the Yakuza detail/importance scale
[1:53:14] <flatcapgame> they got estinien's stink lines and everything
[1:53:15] <MonsieurHedge> i hope they make estinien wear LESS clothes
[1:53:18] <disflipmat> It's gonna be like Yakuza where unimportant people look like shit
[1:53:19] <%radda343> the twins getting off the cart looking better than the cart driver
[1:53:20] <+alphonseisbest> Yes GOOD
[1:53:20] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt or you see estinien and hes not updated and you realize the opposite
[1:53:21] <@TheYellowcouch> I can't wait for hoary boulder to look like an old rough japanese actor
[1:53:26] <%Aeoneth> TBF that's been every JRPG ever.  You can always look att a crowd of people and know.. oh so you'll join the team later
[1:53:27] <+Talimity> ALL MODS BROKEN OH NO
[1:53:28] <+Tarviti> Every important NPC is just a face scanned actor
[1:53:30] <+DinnerCalzone> That just makes me think of the opposite problem Runescape 3 has right now, where new characters get higher and higher detailed but the PC hasn't been updated in like 12 years
[1:53:34] <+PMAvers> What if Estinien just got a bath.
[1:53:40] <+Moaradin> FeelsStrongMan this song
[1:53:43] <TranquiloArman> MAKE GEAR WORK WITH BUNNY EARS

[1:53:46] <%MelfinaStarwind> no hi res G'raha pls
[1:53:46] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt do be fair the upscaling looks good so far so lets hope
[1:53:46] <toulon_somberjade> Pixel count is the new NPC importance scale
[1:53:49] <%MisterTylerrr> I just want capes to work like capes
[1:53:51] <crime_arc> Might just be Japanese to English translation
[1:53:53] <+deeristdaria> she just said update lol

[1:54:00] <+miguelrod777> crazy talked
[1:54:00] <+SolidusRex> What if somebody gave Estinien a body massage
[1:54:03] <+Jojocrm> sry just got here, is this for the next expansion or patch?
[1:54:05] <%Frost_Quill> I don't care if it clips horrible
[1:54:06] <cozmotics> honestly looking forward to updating shadows bc nothing takes me out of a cutscene than seeing a pixel tree shadow going by at 15 frames a second
[1:54:06] <tanarath> Yeah. They'll have to
[1:54:07] <+SoloWingBuddy> Why that's Crazy Talk
[1:54:10] <UberWolfman> GIVE US OUR HATS
[1:54:11] <%Xelig> Wonder if they'll give everyone a fantasia for finding out they're ugly in HD
[1:54:12] <%blackmageslowpoke> Honestly I'd be happy if they just brought everything up to like Cryptlurker gear quality
[1:54:27] <+justianxix> not the dame thing Sega did with PSOW and PSO2NGS?

[2:11:32] <jorniev> WHAT

[2:14:02] <%Ziegsy> pat, watch the hand
[2:14:03] <jorniev> TOUCH IT
[2:14:07] <Astrophizz> that's how it is in most open world games
[2:14:08] <andimustmask> it's probably a shader

[2:14:12] <@TheYellowcouch> that's kinda wack
[2:14:14] <Stonebeard> such pixellation
[2:14:14] <Nurdock> It's generated in the same way
[2:14:15] <%DianaTheAscian> weird
[2:14:17] <Astrophizz> they paint areas to place grass and the game throws grass around
[2:14:18] <%MisterTylerrr> Pat you look like you're jerking it
[2:14:20] <Ape_Law> now it grows, thats how grass works
[2:14:21] <sirtommygunn> why would you do that manually

[2:16:20] <%barkon345> is the entire game going to get this upgrade?
[2:16:23] <Warbot40> SUCH VEGETATION
[2:16:24] <OneThousandTomatoes> yep
[2:16:24] <%Ascethetic> SUCH VEGETATION WAS TOTALLY MY INTENTION
[2:16:24] <+supersonic21> jmikeTouchgrass jmikeTouchgrass jmikeTouchgrass jmikeTouchgrass
[2:16:27] <zenith0111> Theyre making FF14 the metaverse
[2:16:28] <Fallacyxiii> I can hear ps4 fans taking off to the moon
[2:16:41] <JaundiceJoestar> I play on ps4 RIP
[2:16:41] <%NitronStreams> you think theyll add FSR?
[2:16:42] <%Noir_Valdr> I am forever fine with 1080p lol
[2:16:47] <@TheYellowcouch> I love ff14
[2:16:47] <BobPager> Hopefully this all happens after the silicon shortage ends lol
[2:16:55] <BobPager> Fingers crossed for DLSS
[2:16:56] <%tusk102> @JaundiceJoestar graphics are still being updated on ps4
[2:17:01] <zenith0111> All Base ps4s are basically fucked lol
[2:17:02] <%Dakuu75> @barkon345 that's the idea but, not all at once. slowly over the next year or 2 probably
[2:17:04] <arkv01> fuck it I'll take 720p on the ps4 if we can run all these graphical upgrades
[2:17:08] <%MisterTylerrr> nO WAY
[2:17:10] <+izanagi22> Yep
[2:17:11] <%MrBorisMakarov> i believ so
[2:17:13] <%nanaki_ff14> This is weirdly a very hype live letter.
[2:17:15] <andimustmask> @PatStaresAt said they're going to be seriously optimizing it
[2:17:16] <+alphonseisbest> they said so
[2:17:16] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt I think so
[2:17:17] <Astrophizz> they'll probably keep the older assets for the min spec
[2:17:20] <Novusuna> As much of it as it can handle
[2:17:20] <+Ilpala> PS4 is still damn good man, God of War was on that
[2:17:21] <tanarath> @jaundicejoestar 7.0 is in 2 years
[2:17:21] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt they said they'd be supporting ps4 until at least 7.0
[2:17:22] <TheAntiNihilist> They said optimized
[2:17:23] <andimustmask> (the ps4 version)
[2:17:24] <+izanagi22> They said they're adding graphics options choices. The usual Graphics/Performance
[2:17:24] <%RealThiele> until 7.0
[2:17:25] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> I think they said it'd be "optimized"
[2:17:28] <+Talimity> OMFG THANK YOU
[2:17:32] <%TerpanderLux> those shadows love to flicker
[2:17:37] <+cascadepersona> Flickering was the worst, that's a good issue to address
[2:17:41] <+cherrycottontail> ps4 could probably handle most of this at 30 fps
[2:17:42] <%TheHateFish> If this doesn't chug the PS4 to fuck, you'll probably be fine at 4k until they turn it off
[2:17:44] <+vdalson> yeah shadows move at like 10 fps
[2:17:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I never thought it would be pogging at grass but here I am, thank you XIV
[2:17:46] <%Monkeyweed21> crypto cant burst fast enough. COME ON LIQUIDITY CRISIS
[2:17:52] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> I never thought I'd be cheering at grass
[2:17:52] <tanarath> Wait, can they DO THAT?!?
[2:17:53] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt they're adding a graphics/performance option i think
[2:17:53] <+jerkhov> hunt trains definitely unplayable on base ps4 after that update
[2:18:07] <+mrcooperblack> You telling me mashiba got banned? No flickers?
[2:18:16] <%Kevlar_Caviar> ...are they playing the final boss music right now?
[2:18:18] <%TheHateFish> @jerkhov Oh god, the trains are gonna be a goddamned mess
[2:18:18] <AdmiralButtloaf> will the Black Shroud shadows not look like crazy anymore?
[2:18:25] <UberWolfman> lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE
[2:18:29] <+cascadepersona> Endcaller, the *generic final boss theme*
[2:18:34] <zerointelligence000> hd space?
[2:18:35] <%nanaki_ff14> Please don't have this live letter end on NFT implantation for 7.0 lawl
[2:18:37] <%d1stantutopia> @Kevlar_Caviar No, this is the lvl 83 trial music
[2:18:48] <+alphonseisbest> OOOOOOH A HUNT TRAIN WILL KILL A PS4 WITH THSE UPDATES
[2:18:50] <+JohnRSoviet> Endcaller in any other FF game would be the final boss theme
[2:18:55] <Novusuna> He already said no NFTs in game during the pre-show
[2:18:55] <solfuture> i want the lightning fixed
[2:18:56] <zenith0111> DARKER THULE
[2:18:58] <Kravus> darkness, imprisoning me
[2:18:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @nanaki_ff14 they already said No Fuckin Thanks iirc
[2:18:59] <%TheHateFish> @nanaki_ff14 They hard confirmed no NFTs in the bit before this
[2:19:02] <%Arrotal> @nanaki_ff14 they mentioned no nfts in the pre stream
[2:19:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> Darkness. Imprisoning me. All that I see. Absolute horror.
[2:19:07] <Astrophizz> nice, better shadow maps
[2:19:10] <%d1stantutopia> @nanaki_ff14 it started on "FF14 will never have NFTs", so that'd be a crazy twist
[2:19:11] <%Kevlar_Caviar> ah you're right, i keep getting them confused because MAN DOES THIS SONG SOUND LIKE A FINAL BOSS THEME
[2:19:14] <zerointelligence000> I honestly like endcaller more than the actual final boss theme
[2:19:16] <%Cozy90> Pat is so happy
[2:19:17] <%nanaki_ff14> Oh thank gawd guys Im late to the stream

[2:20:08] <+JohnRSoviet> @Kevlar_Caviar But we're only LEVEL 83!!
[2:20:12] <andimustmask> sounds like a gshade will fix the AA issues
[2:20:22] <%Monkeyweed21> Deep fried Exarch will remain
[2:20:25] <valriot> ewww AO
[2:20:32] <andimustmask> @alphonseisbest it smooths edges and reduces pixellated lines on things
[2:20:49] <+DinnerCalzone> @alphonseisbest it reduces the jaggy effect that happens at the edge of models
[2:21:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> AA Shoots down enemy aircraft
[2:21:39] <%nanaki_ff14> AA reserved for 8.0
[2:21:46] <zerointelligence000> AA is good against jump-ins
[2:21:46] <Astrophizz> HDR would be nice

[2:28:15] <%GIGA255> clear
[2:28:19] <tanarath> Good point, that sucks.
[2:28:22] <disflipmat> So wait, what's the focus of the alliance raids>
[2:28:27] <Nupinoop296> YEAH THANK YOU!! Call it something else!!!
[2:28:31] <+Shadowofadoubt> RACISM IS OVER
[2:28:33] <%CalderGaming> good
[2:28:35] <+tsamxxx> lalafels malding at the beast tribe name change
[2:28:36] <+Moaradin> it is weird to call them beast tribes now, yeah
[2:28:36] <RaidenRising> kill the twelve
[2:28:37] <%DianaTheAscian> @disflipmat the 12
[2:28:37] <%ThirdWelles> @disflipmat The lore behind the 12
[2:28:37] <tanarath> Oh well, hopefully they learned from past failures
[2:28:38] <%d1stantutopia> "beast tribe" is problematic
[2:28:39] <%MisterTylerrr> Maybe Native Tribe Quests?
[2:28:39] <zerointelligence000> no more racism
[2:28:40] <+nial_evol> good
[2:28:41] <+HobeBryant> @disflipmat The twelve gods of eorzea
[2:28:41] <%Frost_Quill> Probably the Twelve.
[2:28:43] <+alphonseisbest> LESS FANATSY RACISM LUL
[2:28:44] <penitentpendant> @Monkeyweed21 Final Scene Transition is Haurchefant's ghost defending you from an attack
[2:28:46] <%Nekros4442> CAN WE STILL CALL LALAS A BEAST TRIBE?
[2:28:48] <flatcapgame> ok cool the old name was always a little yikes
[2:28:49] <%asgard147> @disflipmat maybe the Twelve
[2:28:50] <androalfus> yeah it'd be weird to keep calling them that, all higns considered
[2:28:51] <%RealThiele> Merylboobs defeated racism
[2:28:51] <+2DSuperiority> those beastly Dwarfs
[2:28:51] <Blank9> Garlaeans added to Tribe Quests
[2:28:52] <%amused_platypus> The dwarves are a beast tribe change my mind
[2:28:54] <EngiNierXII> Beast tribe is offensive
[2:28:54] <%legendfather_of_giants> no more racism pls
[2:28:54] <%GIGA255> alliance raid is focusing on mythology behind the twelve and who they were
[2:28:54] <Ids560> only the dwarves get to be called beast tribe
[2:28:55] <%PlasmaDood> RACE WAR CANCELED GO HOME
[2:29:00] <andimustmask> @disflipmat the identities of the 12 divines, and other legends of different places
[2:29:33] <%Monkeyweed21> @penitentpendant you have to get stacks of a buff and each stack is a different ally sacrificing themselves to save you from a different mechanic, first Haurchy then Ysayle then Papalymo

[2:29:34] <dizimous> I mean it feels like even the characters in the game are shifting away from the beast tribe label so ya
[2:29:39] <+tsamxxx> @Nekros4442 they literally invented the concept of "beast tribes" so they can do racism
[2:29:40] <%nanaki_ff14> ah yes we get to understand The Travaler and why every ERPer selects them for their deity
[2:29:45] <%KineticZen> Changing the name in-game to correspond to how Eorzean society perceives the beast tribes is one thing, getting OOC offended is dumb
[2:29:47] <%RealThiele> unreal is only for like 1-10% of the population anyways
[2:29:51] <flatcapgame> housing (extreme)

[2:35:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @RobeBLB bc it's the true endgame
[2:35:52] <%d1stantutopia> @RobeBLB Because it's the REAL endgame
[2:35:52] <%radda343> touch dog butt
[2:35:52] <%Fenrirlives> Glamour Apocalypse
[2:35:53] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @RobeBLB because people are serious about glam
[2:35:54] <+izanagi22> @RobeBLB Because Glamour's the true endgame
[2:35:54] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @robeblb the glam limits are sweating LUL
[2:35:55] <@TheYellowcouch> And then Yoshi P said "Give them everything they've ever wanted"
[2:35:57] <%Birdigalore> Does this song have a name btw?
[2:35:59] <%nanaki_ff14> @RobeBLB to match true endgame
[2:36:00] <RyuuAoi> Has Gief been barking the whole time, Pat? I miss him.
[2:36:08] <+cascadepersona> @robeblb Because it's the true end-game

[2:36:48] <+jerkhov> i wonder if no bozja eureka
[2:36:53] <Ape_Law> the whole country?
[2:36:55] <%Frost_Quill> Oh it's NOT the PotD equivalent?
[2:36:58] <kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Do you think the Island Sanctuaries will be better than WoW's equivalents? (Garrisons and the farming stuff in Mists)
[2:36:59] <tanarath> Gief is a growing boy & needs his greens
[2:37:07] <RyuuAoi> Give Gief a steak on his bday
[2:37:16] <28moogles> Pat talking over the first new content they've talked about lol
[2:37:26] <tanarath> @teh_rawk my aunt's dogs love my arugala, just slice it up small.

[2:37:43] <28moogles> Yeah you missed it that's what I mean lol
[2:37:44] <%ThirdWelles> it just wasn't on the slide

[2:39:17] <LivvieLesbian> Have they said whether trust will be available off the bat for new players or only for levelling alt jobs ?
[2:39:24] <%d1stantutopia> @PatStaresAt Is Criterion gonna be tied to the EW relic, do you think?
[2:39:26] <+jerkhov> criterion definitely relic

[2:39:37] <%asgard147> limesHmm
[2:39:39] <@TheYellowcouch> omg I hope it is
[2:39:42] <@TheYellowcouch> that's be so good
[2:39:43] <%RealThiele> raid-like dungeon?
[2:39:43] <MKII> so they're putting resources back into dungeons after scaling back
[2:39:44] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @tusk102 i think a new one besides nidhogg cause that one is 6.1
[2:39:50] <%nanaki_ff14> Can solo Relic weapon hmmm.... that be nice
[2:39:50] <%tusk102> WOO
[2:39:52] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Or something like that
[2:39:52] <%d1stantutopia> I just realised they're CRIT Dungeons
[2:39:55] <Fallacyxiii> working on TEA for triple legend right now, excited for two more.
[2:39:55] <+cascadepersona> Island Sanctuary getting a ton of updates, must be pretty big
[2:39:56] <+SilverObi> so Island Sanctuaries are gonna work like XI's Mog Gardens
[2:39:56] <+jerkhov> island sanctuary is casual version of eureka map asset creation
[2:39:56] <EngiNierXII> Criterion the new relic?
[2:39:57] <squeakyclarinet> Island Santuary seems to have areas like Bozja/Eureka too though.
[2:40:01] <%Das_Prints> Man island sanctuary is so far away. Oh well. Some cool stuff coming in the meantime.
[2:40:02] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It sounds like they're using Criterion to test out a Mythic+ system like WoW has
[2:40:08] <%TerpanderLux> please. another relic weapon i can make solo sounds good to me :)
[2:40:15] <+SammyOVision> Gw2 fractals weren't designed as solo content far as I know, so it'll be a little different
[2:40:19] <haisho> Solo Bardam's Mettle woo!
[2:40:19] <Arbeh> Think Relics will be in Criterion this time?
[2:40:22] <iq_dropper> maybe a small scale Eureka/Bozja?
[2:40:25] <+cherrycottontail> wait. island sanctuary has 'areas'?
[2:40:35] <56Bagels> Criterion sounds like it will be Omega related, best weapons in the universe right?
[2:40:37] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Could Criterion dungeons be "theres no major conflict to run in msq so here's a dungeon"
[2:40:39] <Stonebeard> I want to take Sadu into Bardam's mettle
[2:40:50] <%RealThiele> yea the expanmded sanctuary has me wondering if its actually like an aprtment
[2:40:57] <squeakyclarinet> WTF IS ISLAND SANCTUARY? JUST TELL US!
[2:41:01] <+SilverObi> yeah sanctuaries is sounding a lot like mog gardens, expanding areas over time
[2:41:01] <%TerpanderLux> never :)
[2:41:04] <+cascadepersona> Oh?
[2:41:04] <squeakyclarinet> Blue Mage!
[2:41:04] <@TheYellowcouch> SHUT UP ABOUT BLU MAGE
[2:41:09] <28moogles> nobody is asking about that
[2:41:10] <+cherrycottontail> Maybe criterion is Torghast Kappa
[2:41:11] <MephioTV> SHOW ME MY HROTHGAR HAIRS PLSSS
[2:41:12] <%tusk102> @SuckerPunchSyd hmmm maybe omega?

[2:41:33] <+Moaradin> the blue mage raids are fun
[2:41:33] <%radda343> blu is great for mogtome grinding
[2:41:34] <+jerkhov> mad cuz you got no morbol
[2:41:34] <%nanaki_ff14> BLU is a scam class and the story treats it as a scam
[2:41:36] <BakaTyler> BLUE MAGE PLS bakatyWeh bakatyWeh bakatyWeh
[2:41:37] <%BigCoffee> BLU MAGE CANY DO MSQQ
[2:41:37] <%Taisuru> BLU converted to a read class when
[2:41:38] <%demiiluna> I love blue mage. I HATE what FFXIV did to it.
[2:41:38] <HawkHollywood> TRU BLU REPRESENT
[2:41:40] <qwertusxuz> @itsyagirlmaria maybe. a story wrap up with side small story dungeons or training area stuff could be interesting
[2:41:40] <Who_lio42> and we hate them for liking it
[2:41:40] <%Monkeyweed21> @56Bagels Gerolt getting drunk af at the cafe at the end of the universe
[2:41:43] <andimustmask> all-time favorite class, they did it REAL dirty in 14
[2:41:45] <MephioTV> BLU isn't real
[2:41:45] <@QueequegTheater> BLU UPDATE NEVER
[2:41:47] <haisho> blue mage really got a facelift with the last few updates
[2:41:48] <%tusk102> RIP BLU
[2:41:50] <MonsieurHedge> GIVE BLU SHADOWFLARE
[2:41:52] <%jackythefrost> @RealThiele Fates are fun?
[2:41:53] <Bathezid> I will not care about Blu until it becomes a real class
[2:41:54] <%Valison> Friends don't let friends play blue mage
[2:41:57] <indig0bird> @Sushi2k hello, fellow copium addict
[2:41:57] <BakaTyler> hello! i just got off work we're watching this is cool! bakatyNorb
[2:41:58] <PackitupPaul> blu is the best solo content
[2:42:00] <%W1nterTitan> "I'm friends with lots of Blue Mages"
[2:42:00] <%Cozy90> blu mage is the one thing that almost got me to play
[2:42:02] <$Falilth> "we made a mistake with BLU"
[2:42:02] <+teh_rawk> BLU DEVASTATED
[2:42:02] <tanarath> Blue mage is neat, that's fine
[2:42:04] <%Keyd00d> BLU is cool shut up
[2:42:04] <begemp> Give Blu Terminal Relativity
[2:42:08] <%Monkeyweed21> BLU mains arent really human
[2:42:10] <%tusk102> gonna get all classes to 90 besides blu
[2:42:16] <Travmanic> When's Hildebrand?
[2:42:19] <kainhighwind1990> I'd rather go back to WoW than play more BLU
[2:42:19] <@TheYellowcouch> I do have a friend who would absoloutely play this game as a blu main
[2:42:22] <%ThirdWelles> I wonder if island sanctuary will give us ways to grind out mobs for crafting mats
[2:42:23] <%tusk102> dc travel when tho
[2:42:27] <%RealThiele> @RealThiele less so whena  BLU denys you credit for them by simply existing and overpowering the ability to get fate credit
[2:42:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @begemp give BLU the ATV
[2:42:30] <%nanaki_ff14> Isn't the whole point of the BLU quest is that BLU is a pyramid scheme?
[2:42:36] <%Ynkubus_> BLU is great and I want it to have more stuff for the new orld ties
[2:42:37] <%d1stantutopia> @Travmanic 6.1
[2:42:39] <+jerkhov> ppl thinking no msq lol
[2:42:40] <Ids560> I wanna learn to throw planets at people
[2:42:45] <haisho> give BLU Light Rampant
[2:42:48] <+PirateKefka> Using Trusts to run MSQ dungeons on BLU?  That would seem fun
[2:42:52] <tanarath> @bakatyler need a very basic list of changes?
[2:42:53] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt island sanctuary maybe a way to grind mob drops for crafting?
[2:43:02] <+bassforte123> Blue's quest isn't a scam, it's that people THOUGHT it was a scam because no one bothered to actually learn moves, so they ran into fights empty
[2:43:03] <%TerpanderLux> i hope the arkasodara mount isnt just the knock off dodo mount you use in msq
[2:43:10] <Nupinoop296> it's gonna be that cafe isn't it??
[2:43:13] <%Taisuru> psaDogchamp
[2:43:14] <%Monkeyweed21> give BLU ravensflight
[2:43:20] <seer0ftime> dodo's a HoH drop

[2:43:28] <%ConLin_Arts_> psaDogchamp
[2:43:32] <Macguffn> Garlean Beast Tribe?
[2:43:32] <UberWolfman> @TerpanderLux Now it will be a giant dodo with adornmennts.
[2:43:32] <%Taisuru> I love heeem
[2:43:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> Island Santuary is definitely going to be Loporrit adjacent.
[2:43:34] <%tusk102> fair

[2:45:11] <KickflipShinobi> like power to them
[2:45:13] <RyuuAoi> People need to play Elden Ring.
[2:45:13] <28moogles> With the graphical update that makes sense tbh
[2:45:14] <+KazairLux> totally fine
[2:45:14] <%NitronStreams> 2 weeks? thats nothin
[2:45:14] <vance168> nice and even
[2:45:15] <Ids560> uh ok?
[2:45:16] <%ThirdWelles> Apologizing for delaying two weeks. I fucking love this dev team so much
[2:45:16] <Macguffn> This is fine since they're knocking it out of the park so hard
[2:45:17] <%VirtuesReward> @DrJamesWoods Thanks for the gift sub!
[2:45:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> 2 week delay, now it's a meme!
[2:45:20] <%Taisuru> IT'S FINE
[2:45:20] <MrDrayko> OH NO ITS- a slight inconvenience
[2:45:21] <%asgard147> okay sure, no prob
[2:45:21] <GahimlytheGoblin> this is super fine
[2:45:21] <+izanagi22> Lol, don't apologize team, you could honestly take even longer
[2:45:22] <%TerpanderLux> i mean, this community is pretty good at waiting.
[2:45:22] <tanarath> Never really had a situation where things were good.
[2:45:26] <%tusk102> wow 2 whole weeks
[2:45:26] <nevan_44> oh no what will i do :(
[2:45:29] <Astrophizz> yes let your employees take breaks
[2:45:30] <%nanaki_ff14> More time as a foul Tarnished
[2:45:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> GUYS
[2:45:34] <KickflipShinobi> ooh new holidays
[2:45:34] <%LeiaSkynoober> That's nothing!
[2:45:35] <MacMog> oh no, free time to play other games
[2:45:37] <+SoloWingBuddy> Just as long as the content is quality and they aren't killing themselves working on it that's a-okay
[2:45:37] <qwertusxuz> the team has been killing themselves since 1.0 so they deserve a slowdown
[2:45:43] <+jerkhov> 5.5
[2:45:43] <%LaughingCatt> so patch around the beginning of April?
[2:45:43] <MrDrayko> with the amount of shit they're doing i'm honestly surprised it will be so fast
[2:45:44] <RyuuAoi> 3 a year
[2:45:44] <+Ilpala> we're in the golden age we could've had like half a year between patches
[2:45:45] <%Dakuu75> I wonder if the JP community is also like, "that's fine, get some sleep."
[2:45:46] <ipodstroker_> Would people have even noticed if they didn't announce it?
[2:45:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> The reason he apologized was because of the delays for Endwalker.
[2:45:50] <%tusk102> oh nooooo 2 whole weeks
[2:45:50] <%Monkeyweed21> so April, then August, then Dec, then repeat etc.
[2:45:50] <%RealThiele> content has been quality so this is fine
[2:45:52] <VioletRosefall> more time to enjoy Elden Ring
[2:45:55] <+cascadepersona> That's a better schedule to follow, so I'm fine with it. Drowning in games anyways
[2:46:14] <+SammyOVision> anti crunch practice hopefully
[2:46:18] <%TerpanderLux> hi
[2:46:25] <%nanaki_ff14> speaking of which Iv had Horizon on pause since I tuned in to this stream lol
[2:46:32] <+alphonseisbest> @dakuu75 Right I hope the JP community is as friendly about it
[2:46:44] <+Kango234> Yoshi-P has to launch XVI between those patches.
[2:46:44] <+trackles_64> no holidays allowed says reddit
[2:46:46] <%RealThiele> an additional weekj for summer and new years is hopefully also anti-crunch
[2:46:48] <TheToanon> Are Criterion dungeons EX/Savage dungeons
[2:46:50] <RyuuAoi> NO BREAKS. SCREW YOUR FAMILY
[2:46:52] <TheToanon> Is that what they're doing
[2:46:54] <MacMog> thinking of how much code my team can write in one week and that seems minuscule
[2:46:56] <livi242> how dare they take time off
[2:46:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> but anyway, Automatic demolition of houses resumes on April 22nd, so that's a pretty safe bet for 6.1 day.
[2:47:03] <+jerkhov> jp community has a very outspoken minority
[2:47:04] <9_Blades> good~
[2:47:14] <%asgard147> Fatty boi limesAw psaDogchamp
[2:47:17] <%PlasmaDood> it's not a delay, just an edition of time VoHiYo
[2:47:22] <RyuuAoi> Givin' the dog a bone! AC/DC
[2:47:27] <%PlasmaDood> addition
[2:47:32] <%nanaki_ff14> @TheToanon all we know is its 1-4 players and scales difficulty depending on how many players
[2:47:33] <roughday25> delays because the team is taking time off is entirely fine and I'd like to see it more
[2:47:42] <%TerpanderLux> chjbDance
[2:47:42] <%AHomeschoolDropout> AHomeschoolDropout subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! After absolutely drowning in Fantasia, I have finally landed on a race that I haven't changed in a while. Male Lalafell! Every other race just has one thing that ruins it for me, either too slim, tails clipping, or shit faces.
[2:47:51] <%RealThiele> yea the 2 extra weeks of vacation time is good to see
[2:47:56] <+trackles_64> wow rare japanese work idea
[2:48:06] <@QueequegTheater> >Hates shit faces >Changes to lalafell
[2:48:07] <BobPager> Honestly I'd hope that they'd take even more time if it would improve their working conditions.
[2:48:10] <Astrophizz> 2ch trolls seething
[2:48:11] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[2:48:12] <MacMog> “the devotion of the developers”
[2:48:12] <%Keyd00d> Yoshi is a peach
[2:48:15] <Nupinoop296> give them their time off!!!
[2:48:20] <%LeiaSkynoober> They do deserve tons of time off!
[2:48:21] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> 2 extra weeks between patch cycles is a small price to pay for all the shit they're working on so far
[2:48:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> @AHomeschoolDropout Ah, a man of potaste.
[2:48:23] <Novusuna> Thank you for being a reasonable employer, Yoshida. Please never turn out to not be that.
[2:48:25] <+HobeBryant> Lalas make pants look ugly as sin
[2:48:36] <+MarkoTolstov> @Keyd00d that's what the P in Yoshi-P means
[2:48:38] <+jerkhov> wonder if sqex will make them upsize the team after the huge growth of xiv
[2:48:38] <dybia> The dog, he noms.
[2:48:45] <VioletRosefall> doggo mlems
[2:48:46] <%karovus> i'll take this over crunch any day. they deserve to take time off
[2:48:47] <%ThirdWelles> hasn't it been said that Yoshida has had to yell at employees to go home and take breaks?
[2:48:48] <MrDrayko> "hey maybe crunch had negative effects" is a WILD thing to hear, from a JP dev no less
[2:48:58] <MacMog> I mean, FFXIV is a great product to work on, but “devotion of the workers” is always corporate leeching
[2:49:01] <%Dakuu75> well, sounds like they are being nice about too
[2:49:03] <tanarath> I want them to have 2 months manditory minimum time off
[2:49:07] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @QueequegTheater Nah man, Lala male 3's face makes him look like he's tired of this shit and it's really good
[2:49:10] <%ThirdWelles> or force them, not yell at them
[2:49:12] <joodatious> <3
[2:49:22] <Axlbullet> No mention of data center travel?
[2:49:32] <@QueequegTheater> @AHomeschoolDropout Any face that is not a caved in hole symbolizing its death is bad on a Lalafekk

[2:50:30] <%shurtal> the boy is entirely too much @PatStaresAt
[2:50:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> Data Center Travel won;t be 6.1, it won;t be until after the server expansion is finished in August
[2:50:34] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @AHomeschoolDropout I mean, ironically I used to play Male Roe and had a really good one I designed for it, but idk
[2:50:50] <+alphonseisbest> @macmog dude Yoshi p told a dev to take a week off, said dev then told him he continued to work at home. he finished the project he was on I believe it was something for the bunny girls
[2:50:52] <%tusk102> woo
[2:50:55] <MacMog> #insert maymay about busy work quests
[2:50:57] <+JohnRSoviet> I am more than willing to wait
[2:51:01] <%ElkRiverDog> I mean, if the devs asked for 5 months between patches I'd say they've earned it
[2:51:02] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> You think there'll be a point where they stop adding new jobs because balancing will start getting insane
[2:51:10] <MephioTV> aaaaay this song

[2:51:50] <MacMog> @alphonseisbest oh I believe it, Soken working through cancer treatment. The JP ethos loves it but it’s not healthy

[2:52:11] <+SolidusRex> Fun fact: Venat's character model has her bust slider set to 100
[2:52:12] <%ThirdWelles> It really speaks to the work culture of Japan that they're having to go out of their way to say "hey we're human beings too"
[2:52:14] <%Birdigalore> Supah acu!
