[0:49:39] <Sochin_Iitsu> You should parry RIGHT
[0:49:43] <+FrenchTact1cs> Die to the grunt!
[0:49:44] <fattyboy067> the biggest problem I had with the remaster is if you play with KBM and change the key settings, when you leave the game it doesn't save them

[0:50:17] <Shinmaddrox> I wouldn't really say QLOC did a good job on DD. DD ran on MT Framework. Which you would have to willingly screw up to make it run worse.
[0:50:17] <+patriotrenegade> wow
[0:50:18] <fattyboy067> oh and some enemies have strange aggro ranges in the remaster
[0:50:19] <TheButtravage> @doctor_ryno Exactly, which is why I don't get why everyone is bent out of shape about it.
[0:50:21] <PonyHearts> It's the bad player.
[0:50:25] <$BeardedLuchador> MLG
[0:50:26] <lethallylactic> Pat please

[1:03:47] <+AlopekisPup> So guys. I already own Dark Souls PTDE on Steam. I haven't played yet. Should I just keep going with that or is it worth it to get the remaster and play that instead?

[1:05:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @ChancellorOfLights That's how it is on PC though.

[1:06:24] <QuanticEline> so you gonna rush the fap ring or what?
[1:06:25] <Tisaric> the fire is an objective downgrade
[1:06:26] <+SoarFlyer> Why did they even change the fire
[1:06:27] <Sochin_Iitsu> It's just a fucking fire.
[1:06:27] <%SSaryn> The fire was caressing that sword real good AND I WANT IT BACK
[1:06:27] <SwindlerOfProgress> @uberhox He doesn't have the Master Key.
[1:06:28] <alial96> not my bonfire chan
[1:06:29] <+patriotrenegade> The original bonfire was Estus, not fire
[1:06:29] <$GohanEgret> mamori
[1:06:29] <tinkwease> they ruined bonfire chan
[1:06:29] <%XzileGaming> ah, sweet mamories

[1:06:32] <%socdoc> cheer200 Hey from Plague-tucky! Paige I hope your finger is poised over the biggest goddamn foghorn so when pat makes a wrong turn you loose a honk that shatters the heavens.
[1:06:33] <KittenHachiChan18> Maybe I don't know much about video games then.
[1:06:35] <PiGreat> the bloodspatter looks awful
[1:06:36] <+vaporousTippler> If you play online without a save backup, you're gonna have a bad time.
[1:06:38] <TheEvilOmega> I keep having Hollows weird out on me.
[1:06:38] <xeros720> bonfire-chan is just a dolled up; hussy now
[1:06:39] <+mastertwin2> it looks like fire, which is not what it's supposed to look like
[1:06:39] <pennykettle_> Were DS1's souls always that blue

[1:06:43] <Sochin_Iitsu> BLOWN UP
[1:06:43] <kamen_advent> @TheButtravage The bloom effect on the lava is massively reduced so you notice the repeating pattern a lot more
[1:06:45] <ArgentUndaCova> Memberries
[1:06:45] <undyne486> You member?
[1:06:46] <Medo3G> wombo combo
[1:06:48] <AncelDeLambert> that fireball looks okay
[1:06:48] <%RittiFruity> remember the bomb guy?
[1:06:50] <%elementofloyalty> BELL RING
[1:06:53] <+SaurianCrash> it was meant to be fire not estus
[1:06:53] <iamtheTwitchghost> why did they make items blue?
[1:06:54] <HayabusaTaichou> Remember when Peach was terrified of that skeleton.
[1:07:00] <+SoarFlyer> @pennykettle_ nope
[1:07:01] <Sochin_Iitsu> Sick burn for a PYROMANCER
[1:07:03] <+QueequegTheater> How fitting considering DS3 was just "Memba DS1: The Game"
[1:07:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @ChancellorOfLights I thought you thought the new Remasted edition had faster load times than the Prepare to Die edition. You can't get faster than instant though so they're the same for PC.
[1:07:06] <%SSaryn> WAOW
[1:07:12] <TheButtravage> @kamen_advent So it looks the same as with that mod on that reduced the effect ?
[1:07:14] <Ssaik> That guy is always hilarious
[1:07:17] <%SSaryn> That Skeleton was real radical
[1:07:17] <$GohanEgret> sanic
[1:07:18] <IminyourBase> in order to make this game harder for pat he should have to take paige's advice even it's bad
[1:07:20] <CybertronPrime> Did this game always looks like a PS2 game?
[1:07:20] <Ssaik> the jumping attack down the stairs kills me

[1:07:25] <AncelDeLambert> Sanic
[1:07:27] <cizal11> it isn't
[1:07:28] <sjcodan> Its not
[1:07:29] <Oak_bogle> Gotta go FATH

[1:07:35] <+Ulltraman7> I like the new look tho
[1:07:36] <ArgentUndaCova> God, the rat looks even more disgusting now
[1:07:36] <Superbro64> Kreygasm
[1:07:36] <PiGreat> I kinda prefer the blue actually
[1:07:39] <%SSaryn> Very Sanic
[1:07:40] <ElementalX1000> The effect is different
[1:07:40] <MarylandJutsu> Has Elmo made an appearance yet?
[1:07:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> sanic
[1:07:44] <+patriotrenegade> ITs more similar to Dark Souls II item effects
[1:07:48] <arcadeHemorrhage > man this is awful, the 60 fps smells bad. :(
[1:07:49] <pennykettle_> DS3 is very white, I think DS1 was always a very very light tint of blue
[1:07:49] <+SaurianCrash> white just boring
[1:07:49] <$dotta5> Paige waiting for that McDonalds buff
[1:07:51] <AncelDeLambert> Rolling around at the speed of sound

[1:07:55] <Superbro64> "ahhh" Kreygasm that feels nice
[1:07:55] <$GohanEgret> @MarylandJutsu yes
[1:08:00] <Worldbrand> Are the flowers in darkroot also blue now? because if not, that kinda defeats their purpose
[1:08:00] <richard_2020> GOWAtreus
[1:08:02] <%elementofloyalty> PAIGE IS SO WEAK
[1:08:03] <xeros720> Elmo was at the start, but then he deigned dark souls to be beneath him
[1:08:03] <+QueequegTheater> @pennykettle_ Not even close. DS2 takes place thousands of years later and changed names. In DS3 Andre is literally just sitting there.
[1:08:04] <MarylandJutsu> @GohanEgret good. our son is strong

[1:15:16] <KittenHachiChan18> My dad actually partied with Vanilla Ice. Funny story, he came to the area I live, and he was at a party. My dad talked to him, drank something with him, smoked with him - it was dope, apparently.

[2:23:43] <+Blackmage9999> doodMaxhype doodMaxhype doodMaxhype doodMaxhype
[2:23:44] <Griffin1171> cons to using scythe: Only losers use it
[2:23:46] <%MisterCrimson> Yeah and the DS character isn't looking to good either
[2:23:46] <cizal11> you have to hit with the sweetspot to make optimal use of it otherwise it's not actually the best weapon
[2:23:50] <ArcanumMBD> Lifehunt Scythe has no downsides
[2:23:58] <%elementofloyalty> PAIGE HELP
[2:24:01] <%Lion_kun> black knight sword has an amazing horizontal sweep with rgeat range

[2:24:19] <KaiserMario> They should have a throw pummel in next game to end enemies tightly
[2:24:20] <Jaxnos> oh wow i didn't know beyond two souls was free on ps plus this month nadiaS
[2:24:22] <Everpresent_Overseer> @ArcanumMBD It has one downside you have to kill princes fluffly tail to get it

[2:31:34] <+GeneSlamm> But Pats down
[2:31:37] <+GeneSlamm> Don't
[2:31:38] <louielouielouiie> wasn't DSFix 60FPS?
[2:31:42] <%Phunyun> but didn't you already have it in 60fps with dsfix bliTHINK
[2:31:45] <subjectg> dsfix was
[2:31:45] <+Garrosh_Heckscream> Hell yeah best spell in the game
[2:31:46] <hassanico> @ThespianBarrage Beats Sanctuary Guardian, leaves, comes back expecting double Sanctuary Guardian. Instead it was Triple Sanctuary Guardian
[2:31:48] <ElementalX1000> Most of the time
[2:31:50] <%YabbaTroll> Can anyone tell me if this is locked to 60fps or can i go to 144?
[2:31:51] <+Garrosh_Heckscream> Promised Walf of Peace
[2:31:54] <Valask> good job pat
[2:31:55] <thelonechris> Poked
[2:31:58] <strangelee> Man, listening to Pat tell Woolie that the scaling increase was worthless in Bloodborne is always hard to listen to
[2:31:59] <+Confused_4K> Locked
[2:31:59] <EASrake> those lizards look good
[2:32:00] <SwindlerOfProgress> I know he wants the big damage, but he could really do with more stamina.
[2:32:00] <louielouielouiie> @YabbaTroll it's locked i believe
[2:32:01] <%elementofloyalty> God dam Kermi
[2:32:04] <alwayspronking> yeah, TWOP is some shit
[2:32:05] <+LogothX> That hurt noise makes me laugh so much
[2:32:06] <Blueshirtt> I mean you could play it in 60 before, if you didnt mind running risking rocketing through the bottom of a ladder
[2:32:06] <Press_X_ToJASON> would you say Dark Souls is now approachable and fun? Kappa @AngriestPat
[2:32:06] <KittenHachiChan18> Never before have frogs disgusted me so.
[2:32:08] <Griffin1171> kero kero
[2:32:08] <+LogothX> "oooOooohh..."
[2:32:09] <%SaltyDongs> Aura/Ora
[2:32:12] <Minorou> @d4c_trice Scorched Conract mod adds a new stipulation to the gameplay with every boss kill. The harder the boss, the harsher the stipulation. It's probably the most impressive DS1 mod out there right now
[2:32:12] <%YabbaTroll> fack, damn you japan
[2:32:14] <%YabbaTroll> ty
[2:32:20] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat how you like the fact you got thanos gauntlet in god of war and hit it straight against a wall(pole)
[2:32:21] <%elementofloyalty> too slow
[2:32:21] <mishtershmee> That's all I want to be, cool and tough. Or cool and hung. Or tough and hung. Or hung.
[2:32:21] <%YabbaTroll> ah well
[2:32:25] <+PenmanLupine> that ragdolling is so ridiculous
[2:32:27] <LewdPatrol> Pat said to his fans waiting for Detroit
[2:32:27] <+Xalgar> You know what I mean? Perfect!
[2:32:27] <KittenHachiChan18> Guess he CROAKED
[2:32:29] <+D4C_Trice> There was a 60fps bug where you felt out of world with DSfix by sliding down ladders
[2:32:33] <EASrake> unapproacable and not fun
[2:32:35] <Warnawl> I was out for a bit whats the death count at?
[2:32:39] <PopdropGardner> What in the fuck are those? I NEVER saw those before, it new?
[2:32:39] <e_d__> I honestly don't think it's that unapproachable
[2:32:42] <Everpresent_Overseer> Dark souls the dark souls of dark souls
[2:32:42] <%elementofloyalty> Leana it is not for
[2:32:43] <mishtershmee> More than one, less than all.
[2:32:47] <sileo_patronus> Time to start farming green blossoms for pvp
[2:32:47] <Blueshirtt> that bug is hilarious as heck though
[2:32:50] <hassanico> @Minorou It does some super wacky stuff, I love it
[2:32:52] <wolfen091> dark souls remastered, just another soulsborne clone
[2:32:53] <SwindlerOfProgress> Dark Souls is approachable. It's just not for everybody.
[2:32:54] <Intolerable> @angriestpat that man-moan is the sole reason i never pick a guy character in DS
[2:32:56] <KaiserMario> HOw about erotic and lascive?
[2:32:57] <+brave_sj> @AngriestPat Do you think it's fair to call this the Cuphead of RPGs?
[2:33:01] <%elementofloyalty> SNEEZE
[2:33:01] <mishtershmee> @PopDrop They aren't new, they've been there since the beginning.
[2:33:02] <Heart0fInk> would you recommend DS1 for someones first Souls game?
[2:33:03] <SulfurousAcid> sneeze out your ass
[2:33:04] <%SSaryn> We sure are.
[2:33:05] <+bonzosan> yeah
[2:33:05] <+JustbeJake> Yes
[2:33:05] <+doublespeakk> I buy the game, load it up, and no sound whatsoever. Sometimes I hate computers
[2:33:05] <+cvp5127> no
[2:33:07] <+Ryuartyi_> Very much so
[2:33:07] <%elementofloyalty> very much
[2:33:08] <grayjammer> Yeyeye

[2:33:13] <Rngiddion> I am personally just glad the people who shit on Souls for being unfair and hard have shut up
[2:33:14] <+griffball13> these souls are the dankest
[2:33:16] <%SaltyDongs> Ye
[2:33:16] <$RubberFistFight> Dark Souls is gruelling, unforgiving, punishing, and frustrating, but most importantly it is FAIR. With few exceptions, the combat rules that apply to you apply to the enemies as well.
[2:33:17] <ministarbury> yes
[2:33:18] <LewdPatrol> Enjoying Elmo FeelsGoodMan

[2:34:04] <$RubberFistFight> The fun of the game comes from the absurd relief and sense of accomplishment you get from killing the bosses. The game requires you to keep a level head or you'll fail, so all the EEMOSHUNZ get bottled up.

[2:38:43] <SuperCreeperBlocks> I usually just kill him in the prison
[2:38:45] <+Cigwynn> Lautrec did nothing wrong, Pat did everything wrong!!!

[2:40:09] <+linSP> did they fix the skip from early undead burg to capra
[2:40:09] <VritraReiRei> Does that mean GoW get rotated out or TMS? @AngriestPat
[2:40:11] <+PenmanLupine> Episode 0 was good stuff

[2:40:19] <+PenmanLupine> can't wait to see everyone get full Bingo spaces
[2:40:19] <%SSaryn> Memes*
[2:40:22] <+Chewygamer> So worth or no?

[2:40:31] <KittenHachiChan18> And if you don't?
[2:40:31] <+Timmaahh97> fisto wants you to assume the position
[2:40:34] <TheButtravage> Beware of Vamos new bonfire if you don't have lord vessel, getting stuck down there with bonewheels is not a great idea.
[2:40:34] <The_Blumper> And if you get everything wrong?
[2:40:35] <%Phunyun> @linSP very few bugs like that were fixed
[2:40:37] <PiGreat> i never even noticed the drowning connection until it was pointed out
[2:40:38] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat yep "Super Best Friends Play Detroit: Become Human (Episode Zero)" 4 hours ago
[2:40:39] <+Confused_4K> Man the pyro set is U G L Y
[2:40:41] <TheJustGordo> does diagonal lines count in bingo?
[2:40:42] <$Railstone> @lankaster88 i feel like thats the case for every david cage game though
[2:40:42] <EASrake> i can lie about the date too pat Kapp

[2:40:44] <C_game_me_811> @bournewarrior doodBro
[2:40:44] <%Zombiemowlcher> @Chewygamer No the game is about 6 hours long if you take your time
[2:40:44] <EASrake> Kappa
[2:40:45] <TalisKanju> Or that means you're all in too far DEEP.
[2:40:45] <Valask> So, the guy that made Twitch Plays Dark Souls made a new one with 0 latency today
[2:40:45] <PiGreat> but there's gotta be some drowning
[2:40:46] <KaiserMario> NO... means David is a cuck
[2:40:47] <TrubbleBass> @Ferraeon dissappointment
[2:40:47] <$RubberFistFight> I kinda want to do a stream of Beyond Two Holes and spend the entire stream just mocking it and dissecting everything wrong with it. But I'm not as acerbic as Pat or as funny as Mike/Mr Plinkett so I'll just come off as a gigantic asshole.
[2:40:50] <mishtershmee> @The_Blumper Then David Cage bamboozled them
[2:40:51] <EVA_Unit02> If you get all of them right, then aren't you on the same wavelength as David Cage?
[2:40:51] <$RubberFistFight> Which to be fair I kinda m.

[2:58:34] <EASrake> The number was the way out but she still needs to interact with him so a fake number wouldn't work
[2:58:40] <%Remery_> Women are fucking strange!
[2:58:44] <RCtiger0> Man I got that a lot from a girl once. Just move on to the next one otherwise they might see you as desperate
[2:58:51] <DoctorPhilsJazzBand> If she isn't rearranging a time that works for her it ain't gonna work out mang
[2:58:53] <ritcholi> Do you guys talk other than that?
[2:58:59] <+Timmaahh97> F

[2:59:05] <+Timmaahh97> sorry that was preemptive
[2:59:06] <%SSaryn> Women have cooties. Get away from them.
[2:59:07] <%Robnoceros> I've had a girl give me her number and then say she was busy before. I gave it 3 tries and gave up
[2:59:12] <Worldbrand> maybe she gave you the number because she didn't feel comfortable/safe saying no in your presence? not enough information.
[2:59:13] <+Mrmugz> Women are aliens
[2:59:13] <%elementofloyalty> Butt crack is juicy
[2:59:15] <C_game_me_811> @remery_ yeah

[3:01:23] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight Yeah, I'm not super invested - overall, the remaster is a good thing. I will FOREVER be indignant of the Bonfire thing, though, and that's because it just feels like walking back intentional art design for similarity to the sequels.

[3:04:32] <Griffin1171> the barrel!
[3:04:38] <%SuperCasualBoom> When Paige ate just the ham, Pat.
[3:04:38] <%MegaOrangutan> Pat is a half-eaten sandwich
[3:04:38] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight Exactly. And for me it's really just that it's either a mistake or it's being done because From wants to canonize the look from the later games, despite the coily Bonfire being such a visual symbol for the game. But y'know, it's small shit, DS1 is alive again and that's neat. Hell, Gravekeepers work for once. Someone might even see a Vagrant!
[3:04:44] <%bootysteve> Love is a homeless man who's digging in the trash and finds some gold coins. They turn out to be chocolate but even though he isn't rich he's happy cause he was hungry in the first place

[3:07:52] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat - tell Paige she might be onto something there, given that SLE causes a whole bunch of generalised inflammation even outside of flareups.

[3:08:21] <+creamandsugar> if it's inflammation, does tumeric or bromeline do anything for it?

[3:09:21] <KittenHachiChan18> Lupus is an auto-immune disease that makes the body attack itself. It causes inflammation, etc.
[3:09:21] <+Bt_Robot> She has the lupus that turns her into Black Widow.

[3:09:49] <punkthepsychopenguin> So wait
[3:09:50] <$RubberFistFight> @Heart0fInk - it's an autoimmune condition where the immune system starts to attack the internal organs. It causes all sorts of problems, swelling, organ adhesions, joint issues, etc.
[3:09:52] <+shabop> tumeric pretty tasty
[3:09:53] <QaizerArt> Tumeric is incredible for anti-inflammation and generally other good health shit.
[3:09:54] <%Remery_> Lupus are weak against Fighting types?

[3:10:12] <+cvp5127> lupus or super lupus
[3:10:12] <+creamandsugar> also bromeline, its from pinapples, it is also an antiinflammatory. Helps digest meats too oddly enough

[3:10:40] <+reaped_psyche> It's not new armor. You just never saw it.
[3:10:41] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - actually they call it Lupus because of the characteristic facial rash. In the old times they apparently thought it made people seem "wolf like".
[3:10:43] <subjectg> it’s the mriwont4get armor
[3:10:45] <captainthunderwolf> Is this just an armor that was in the last game but didn't drop?
[3:10:45] <%elementofloyalty> very sexiest

[3:15:24] <deviljhojho94> what the fuck
[3:15:25] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - not only that, but the fact that basically the only treatment is constant high-dose steroids, it leaves your already fucked immune system in tatters. meaning all sorts of opportunistic infections set up shop.
[3:15:26] <Primary_> the real glass cannon build is with the painting guardian sword. highest dmg dex weapon
[3:15:29] <Worldbrand> hahahaha
[3:15:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol

[3:16:03] <Blackjackal95> gorillas are fucking scary
[3:16:03] <SwindlerOfProgress> Pat's not into it.
[3:16:05] <YO_WHADUP> robits get their gears clogged by mustard
[3:16:06] <$RubberFistFight> @elementofloyalty - it'd be like in A.I. when he tries to eat and his face half falls off.
[3:16:07] <Firesparks> threaten elmo
[3:16:07] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight Oh, so it's functionally AIDS but it makes you itchy and dumb. That's seriously awful, dude.
[3:16:08] <%Remery_> The boob?
[3:16:09] <Everpresent_Overseer> the brain
[3:16:13] <Firesparks> robot paige wouldn't care

[3:16:18] <subjectg> shoot one, hope for overpenetratiob
[3:16:19] <SwindlerOfProgress> There's only one bullet, though.
[3:16:19] <%elementofloyalty> Shot her in the Mom
[3:16:20] <+cvp5127> does not compute
[3:16:21] <AtlasMcCoy> Why not just use a metal detector or a magnet?
[3:16:23] <EASrake> Isn't this the plot of detriot Kappa
[3:16:23] <rmwolfe> isnt every part of paige a fatal part
[3:16:25] <thelonechris> Shoot both
[3:16:26] <+KillScottKill> I honestly doubt any part of Paige being shot would be non-fatal, knowing her.
[3:16:26] <RCtiger0> If you shoot the robo one the bullet would bounce off and hit you in the face
[3:16:26] <+rai_co> perform the Voight Comp test
[3:16:27] <Sacksquatch> just punch
[3:16:27] <+universefish> what if it's like a detroit
[3:16:27] <+creamandsugar> with his penis
[3:16:27] <+SoarFlyer> Evil bee Paige

[3:16:34] <lankaster88> A david cage one Kappa
[3:16:35] <%elementofloyalty> YES
[3:16:36] <Zombrocom> God damn synths! Taking our jobs!
[3:16:36] <Firesparks> threaten elmo and the one who react is the real one
[3:16:36] <KTDelgado> you pee on it
[3:16:37] <%KittenHachiChan18> Poor rotted kitty . . .
[3:16:38] <+GreatBrightBlack> what if it's better than the orignal
[3:16:40] <%Remery_> \Robo Paige MrDestructoid MrDestructoid
[3:16:40] <Sotetsu> Robots can't get lupus, so do a lupus test.
[3:16:41] <+furiousfurioso> the answer is easy, try to take the mustard away from them. The robot will be able to fight you off much easier
[3:16:42] <YO_WHADUP> robits also have sparks coming out of their mouths
[3:16:42] <%oddslogic> would she remember the time
[3:16:43] <Thalchampz> ass at risk
[3:16:45] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - eh, sort of. HIV destroys your immune system's ability to fight back. Lupus instead sends it into overdrive forcing it to fight itself.
[3:16:46] <count_bob> True facts: The ass is the safest place to shoot someone.
[3:16:47] <+LogothX> Look its plague
[3:16:48] <TheMilhouseExperience> Point it at a pregnant lady and watch for a reaction.
[3:16:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat The real one is the one who doesn't remember.
[3:16:49] <%elementofloyalty> Buckey head
[3:16:52] <+LogothX> and there he goes...
[3:16:53] <%Remery_> Robo Paige
[3:16:54] <blue6sub6remnant6> Space ninja hats.
[3:16:54] <mistermastergreg> the real one won't remember the time
[3:16:55] <%KittenHachiChan18> Buckey?
[3:16:58] <Flurbleman44> Do the Okuyasu technique and guess right
[3:17:00] <Nemesisnick33> isnt every part of paige a fatal part though? Kappa
[3:17:00] <+shabop> just shoot the one you think is the real paige. crazy talk will kick in and you will shoot the robot.
[3:17:02] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - but the end result is similar-ish
[3:17:02] <RCtiger0> The real one is blind
[3:17:04] <%elementofloyalty> MAKE EM KISS
[3:17:10] <AMajorTom> pistol-whip both and examine the blood
[3:17:10] <%GarbageNirvana> Glad they kept the dead bodies staying stuck on your feet
[3:17:12] <Chumblago13> Make both robots click the "Im not a robot" checkbox. Clearly that's enough.
[3:17:13] <Minorou> wouldn't robo-Paige be better then?
[3:17:13] <@Mechz71> this was all build up so Paige could answer the question herself
[3:17:18] <mistermastergreg> the real one is stupid
[3:17:20] <$mandragoraroot> NotLikeThis

[3:17:24] <%SSaryn> PAIGE 5 MINUTES.
[3:17:24] <%elementofloyalty> 5
[3:17:25] <blue6sub6remnant6> Get him to say something wrong. A robot doesn't know to be wrong.
[3:17:26] <Worldbrand> paige gets butt-eaten by gorillas
[3:17:27] <vivecdidnothingwrong> Strong planning
[3:17:27] <$GohanEgret> 5
[3:17:28] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight I get it, dog. I just won't get my family back as hostages unless I make every given opportunity into a joke. That's why I said "functionally" AIDS.
[3:17:28] <$mishtershmee> @AngriestPat Paige, you ONLY have the gun and bullet.

[3:17:49] <%socdoc> cheer200 Yo peach I heard you mention licorice root. I didn't catch how often you use that stuff but too much or for too long can cause high blood pressure, low potassium, and heart/muscle problems. Not sure if it's enough to stop you from getting mad swole; just don't explode your heart kthx
[3:17:50] <Heart0fInk> Can robo Pat jizz?
[3:17:50] <subjectg> Put portable hole in bag of holding instead of bothering with the gun

[3:17:59] <%Remery_> Just give each Paige a sandwich and see which one actually eats it normally!!!!
[3:18:00] <Everpresent_Overseer> Paige has time magic confirmed
[3:18:01] <miracleman6> there's no way robo pat would have a big enough dick
[3:18:02] <$dotta5> Fick Moley
[3:18:03] <fireking900> Just point the gun at one of them and see which one shits there pants the hardest then shot the other one
[3:18:04] <+doctor_ryno> Is Moley a tramp stamp?
[3:18:05] <%elementofloyalty> FAKE THE ORGASM

[3:18:08] <vivecdidnothingwrong> MOLY x2
[3:18:08] <%IrishWeegee> >shoot the left one
[3:18:16] <captainthunderwolf> How about just SHOOT someone and GO ON IN A RELATIONSHIP with whoever survives?
[3:18:16] <%SSaryn> I keep telling you man, CHECK FOR THE BIGGEST DICK
[3:18:18] <AtlasMcCoy> How do you know if the robot has fake emotions or real emotions?
[3:18:22] <vivecdidnothingwrong> PISS TECHNIQUES
[3:18:23] <RCtiger0> So she sees him piss?
[3:18:24] <PiGreat> that's a podcast title

[3:18:28] <$TheNeedlesD> If it planks on the toilet, it's Pat
[3:18:29] <MartiusGW> would robot hold roll of paper?
[3:18:31] <Worldbrand> she's talking about holding the toilet paper, right?
[3:18:31] <OkamiDude15> LUL
[3:18:32] <+griffball13> hold the toilet paper
[3:18:32] <+SoarFlyer> "whoever is you is you"
[3:18:33] <BourneWarrior> Like Kano?
[3:18:35] <ancrest_tant> The grunts are far more sexy than I remember each time I come back
[3:18:35] <Firesparks> threaten elmo, it will determind who is the real paige
[3:18:36] <@Mechz71> this is really dumb

[3:18:39] <Chumblago13> So, who ever is clearly wrong is the real Pat. @AngriestPat
[3:18:40] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat - ask her this: if Pat was killed and replaced by a perfect clone that was externally indistinguishable from the original, and believed itself to be the original, WOULD IT BOTHER YOU?
[3:18:40] <%KittenHachiChan18> Then be like, "I'll have what they're having"
[3:18:40] <Primary_> anybody played david cages new piss fetish game called Detroit: Become Humid?
[3:18:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lewd
[3:18:41] <+shabop> get them both to play dark souls. first to die is the real pat.
[3:18:42] <Ell1ot> check to see if it has 2 balls
[3:18:43] <Meekest> The robot would agree to anything and Pat will argue every one
[3:18:46] <vivecdidnothingwrong> Lies
[3:18:46] <%elementofloyalty> yes
[3:18:48] <$dotta5> Just spill Redbull on both of their pants, whichever ones dick doesn't catch fire
[3:18:48] <ElementalX1000> My bloodline technique
[3:18:53] <$Ponch65> shoot them both for being a shit
[3:18:55] <FadingEmber> Then who care which one you shot if they are both the same
[3:18:55] <+griffball13> TOO LEWD
[3:18:59] <wsintai> @AngriestPat Just take both of the Pat's as your Twin Lovers

[3:19:10] <+SuichiTanaka> LUL
[3:19:11] <OkamiDude15> tell both of them that their boss called for them to go to work and whichever one freaks out is pat

[3:22:25] <Everpresent_Overseer> @AngriestPat They turned away and another woman that lost her baby took it. A vicious cycle
[3:22:27] <+SoarFlyer> @RubberFistFight can he kill the clone instead for more time on the clock?
[3:22:27] <CloudCircus> remember how you would take all the lost kids and bring them to your dungeon @AngriestPat ?
[3:22:28] <$TheNeedlesD> Pat's not kidding about that
[3:22:31] <subjectg> There’s a reason why babies die in someone’s car

[3:22:44] <Ell1ot> did Paige leave Pat in the cart and freak out when she couldn't find him?
[3:22:44] <$RubberFistFight> @SoarFlyer - based on the shit he said during the SOMA playthrough, I think he would NOT consider a perfect copy to be the same as himself. He pretty clearly believes in the concept behind "the soul".
[3:22:44] <Nemesisnick33> EZ way to tell which one is pat slyly change the brightness on the TV when they arent looking SeemsGood

[3:23:09] <blue6sub6remnant6> So, how many lost children are around Paige and Pat's apartment?
[3:23:14] <+Nephthyz> Pat is basically a giant infant, so Paige already has plenty of experience raising a child.
[3:23:16] <$RubberFistFight> @SoarFlyer - like, the idea that there's only one "you" and a copy or clone is just a new person using you as a template.

[3:23:49] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight A perfect copy IS me as far as I'm concerned, but he would have to fuck me to obtain full rights. And then we'd fight, because we'd both want to in either case.
[3:23:49] <shurtal> My brother's ex wife was in the bathroom stall at a Chili's and her a woman say "I can't do this anymore" and walk out. When the ex wife left her stall, there was a baby in a carrier in the middle of the floor.

[3:24:52] <shurtal> Yeah, it really fucked with her head.
[3:24:56] <+SoarFlyer> @RubberFistFight I think it's based on stream of consiousness, like if an exact duplicate of this Dark Souls stream went up, along with this one, even though they're both the "same" stream, this one is still the original "real" stream.
[3:24:58] <%elementofloyalty> Paige could be Amy Hedgehog to Pats Eggman

[3:35:13] <%KittenHachiChan18> Wtf
[3:35:15] <$RubberFistFight> @SoarFlyer - yeha, they ran out of time/money and had to fill the place with enemies, so they just copy-stamped a bunch of dragon asses everywhere
[3:35:15] <%Keyd00d> Does the Izalith lava no longer give you eye cancer?
[3:35:19] <$RubberFistFight> it's laazy as fuck

[3:35:25] <%elementofloyalty> Rub Pats belly for good luck
[3:35:27] <ArcanumMBD> the explosion was always infront of Stray Demon. Every time. Just different attacks happened at different ranges infront of him. So you just hug his ass, run away when he attacks, and you're golden
[3:35:31] <keksisblyat> Totally not the 39 dex and best dex weapon in the game Kappa Pat is the fucking strong
[3:35:37] <Scharfster> THE DOLL
[3:35:42] <captainthunderwolf> @SoarFlyer So they're supposed to be the dragon asses to the half dragons up above, right? But From couldn't decide where to put those, so they filled up an empty area with them instead because they looked demonic. Therefore Izalith is full of dragon asses.

[3:47:34] <+reaped_psyche> THoly shit... that is new... 0.o
[3:47:36] <%DedlokPM> @ElementalX1000 By the skeleton blacksmith
[3:47:37] <applesonthemoon> google proxypaige LUL
[3:47:37] <Fox_landale> Easy mode would just give you a map.
[3:47:39] <Aydarkzero> that really needed a bonfire
[3:47:41] <%elementofloyalty> Vos
[3:47:42] <Cheshern> Easier Dark Souls is zero bosses.
[3:47:42] <GurrenPrime> easy mode would be no humanity and instant multiplayer summons
[3:47:42] <ArcanumMBD> easy mode = map. or enemy radar
[3:47:43] <+linSP> he's in deep with this bonfire
[3:47:43] <+Templar15> this is the only change in remastered IIRC
[3:47:44] <+Nephthyz> Pat's real name is Felacious Scrunchie and Paige's is Mandrigo Sanchez.
[3:47:44] <Ell1ot> i thought easy mode was adding a map
[3:47:45] <ElementalX1000> Oh I see
[3:47:49] <+CourageTheCat> easy dark souls is 100 percent a MAP
[3:47:49] <C_game_me_811> A map doodCrazy
[3:47:51] <AtlasMcCoy> Easy mode would let you keep souls on death
[3:47:51] <Worldbrand> I'm reading that lighting a bonfire sets it as your spawn now? Is that true?
[3:47:52] <+SoarFlyer> it would be DS3 warping between all bonfires from the start
[3:47:52] <%Plutt_bug> Easy mode is the removal of bonefires
[3:47:53] <Flurbleman44> NOT DARK SOULS
[3:47:54] <%QuanticEline> i wonder if they added one later in new londo because thats the one other area besides this that needed one
[3:47:54] <YO_WHADUP> I wonder if you can warp to it?
[3:47:55] <+PresidentWaffles> AGATHA
[3:47:56] <+SaurianCrash> easy mode was ds3
[3:47:56] <captainthunderwolf> That Bonfire STILL makes me angry because it's not curly though
[3:47:57] <Cheshern> Omg, yes . A map
[3:47:58] <+KoyaMusa> well then dark souls isn't for them
[3:47:59] <alcors_wisdom> yeah like plague
[3:47:59] <alwayspronking> @AngriestPat Easy mode is just summon help. Its already in the game.
[3:48:04] <%KittenHachiChan18> @AngriestPat If you beat this next guy in one round, I'll do something stupid
[3:48:04] <KaiserMario> FAGINA
[3:48:06] <RCtiger0> Purist
[3:48:06] <Mnightshyamallama> They added one to put one next to the skeleton blacksmith
[3:48:08] <%bootysteve> Any mods around?
[3:48:08] <%SaltyDongs> Arale
[3:48:09] <+CourageTheCat> DEJA VU
[3:48:09] <Cheshern> Sad enemy.
[3:48:11] <%GarbageNirvana> :[

[3:48:13] <Ferraeon> ds has just enough if not more than needed
[3:48:13] <+Timmaahh97> Can i get my dark souls uuuhhh BONELESS
[3:48:14] <Everpresent_Overseer> @PresidentWaffles then she can train ghost pokemon
[3:48:14] <sileo_patronus> @Worldbrand that was always the case
[3:48:17] <HopperReborn> @gohanegret Is this "remaster" really marked at 60$?
[3:48:17] <EASrake> These bonewheel skeletons are gatekeeping
[3:48:18] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - yeah but that stray demon spell effect doe
[3:48:18] <Fujiwara_92> easy mode is no weapon restriction
[3:48:18] <%elementofloyalty> SHUT UP CHECKERS
[3:48:19] <Cheshern> Sadder boss.
[3:48:20] <+CourageTheCat> checkers is extremely NOT hard
[3:48:20] <dikkybubba> the bonfire is for vamos, if you need a bonfire shortcut for pinwheel you might be in a bad spot as far as capability
[3:48:20] <C_game_me_811> BabyRage
[3:48:20] <%badmr7> There is difficulty and then there is obtuse
[3:48:21] <%SaltyDongs> Kimberly
[3:48:22] <Crankthulhu> Pat wants to ensure a future for the Dark Souls race
[3:48:24] <TestAnon> wtf nerf red
[3:48:24] <+Cityscape17> DS1? :D fuck yeah
[3:48:25] <fireking900> DONT LET THE UNWASHED MELEE PLAYERS IN
[3:48:28] <+XxBTExX> Gaykeeping?
[3:48:29] <+Cityscape17> easiest boss here we go!
[3:48:29] <Truxton_II> The Gatekeeper from Nightmare, the board game.
[3:48:30] <%SaltyDongs> Annabelle
[3:48:30] <+chernyk0> papa!
[3:48:31] <$GohanEgret> @HopperReborn no idea I just made a terrible joke
[3:48:32] <%Remery_> @AngriestPat Has Paige every made your heart go Doki Doki?
[3:48:33] <Cheshern> This boss sucks.
[3:48:34] <+KillScottKill> no one gatekeeps checkers because checkers exists to gatekeep chess
[3:48:34] <%SSaryn> Pros and Cons, take your pick.
[3:48:36] <Cheshern> SUPER fast.
[3:48:37] <%elementofloyalty> Very fast
[3:48:37] <alwayspronking> 1st try?
[3:48:38] <%Falilth> MY FATHER
[3:48:38] <EASrake> 1.5 secods
[3:48:39] <%SSaryn> 20 seconds.
[3:48:40] <+Yeajow> noble people gatekept checkers for like ever
[3:48:40] <deviljhojho94> 4 SECONDS
[3:48:40] <SovPho> There are plenty of bosses that are *way harder* with summons
[3:48:40] <HayabusaTaichou> Easy mode is having the enemies despawn after killing them ten times.
[3:48:40] <%KittenHachiChan18> Who is that?
[3:48:40] <+Ophill> 2 hits
[3:48:41] <ChuckMagnus> inb4 death from pinwheel
[3:48:41] <Meme_Platinum> oh hey you guys are still going
[3:48:42] <Cheshern> 45 secs.
[3:48:43] <ancrest_tant> Checkers is the Dark Souls of board games
[3:48:44] <The_Sorrow_> 2 swings
[3:48:44] <%KittenHachiChan18> Pinwheel?
[3:48:45] <@thenefftw> GET GIANT DAD
[3:48:45] <%Plutt_bug> 4 deaths
[3:48:46] <%spacekataz18> Pat is going to die to pinwheel
[3:48:46] <$RubberFistFight> @fireking900 - fuck them and their stupid 1% specifically broken controllers.
[3:48:46] <alcors_wisdom> the real question is will he get the right mask
[3:48:47] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> PINWHEEL IS A PURE BOY SwiftRage

[3:48:53] <%KittenHachiChan18> WHAT THE FUCK
[3:48:54] <grayjammer> God. Pinwheel's music is the best though.
[3:48:55] <+CourageTheCat> hes pretty cool lookin
[3:48:55] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight It's like they did everything right and then they made the most offensive minor mistake they could possibly make, you know what I mean?
