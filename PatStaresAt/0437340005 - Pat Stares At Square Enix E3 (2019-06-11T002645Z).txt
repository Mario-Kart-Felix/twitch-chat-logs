[0:05:17] <%trillmagical> OobiSoft
[0:05:17] <Luis_bardock12349> Ubisoft is trash. no rayman 4

[0:05:19] <prince_ire> @AngriestPat Was Tom Clancy at Ubisoft?
[0:05:19] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> No Rayman 4, what a waste of time

[0:05:21] <%chubbypencil> Watchdogs 3 looks good tho
[0:05:21] <King_Wolf_Rigger> You know, for a long time I got Tom Clancy and Stephen King mixed up. That was embarrasing.

[0:05:26] <%Beough> im so disappointed no splinter cell
[0:05:26] <simifu> Worst than beth?
[0:05:26] <MForan98> PSO2 making it west side after years is pretty surprising
[0:05:26] <rufus2k2> remember the Ubiart engine?
[0:05:27] <b_ikki> but the DANCING
[0:05:27] <+TheWe4pon> @AngriestPat give me a TLDW of ubisoft
[0:05:28] <+PenmanLupine> it was dull. it wasn't insultingly masturbatory like Bethesda was.
[0:05:28] <%lovebass4stuff> @AngriestPat i had to watch it at Liam's stream and i slept half way in.
[0:05:28] <Nevy4256> @AngriestPat What's your proper take on PSO2 coming to the west?
[0:05:28] <%Solidnick18> watchdogs was ok
[0:05:28] <+aivalera> Poor Clemps was fucking DYING
[0:05:28] <ExpressNode> I never saw it, but I can imagine

[0:05:30] <%cvp5127> hope you like tom clancy
[0:05:30] <Onmi_Khaos> It was just dull
[0:05:30] <$feverThings> Cheer100 another winner is the MK3 stage play from the pre pre show last night.
[0:05:31] <b_ikki> true
[0:05:31] <$valriot> Im SUPER mad that RS Quarantine isnt a new ZombiU game @angriestpat
[0:05:31] <Cranky_Construct> I was cooking chili, was it that bad?
[0:05:32] <%lodwilk> lodwilk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! This can't be any worse than the Ubi presentation right?
[0:05:32] <+Dre_> what about the old lady assassin
[0:05:33] <%Rumbutt> that's impressive
[0:05:33] <%MrSpaceLion> Mr Clemps did
[0:05:33] <CandideCamera> Watch Dog Legion looks rad though
[0:05:34] <Zuzu_Pachulia> fucking sick ff6 shirt
[0:05:34] <%Kataguro> At least Helen the Hacker and 007 Flanders were fun
[0:05:34] <%Remery_> fucking For Honor :(
[0:05:34] <%ItsRatman> WatchDogs Legion looked hype... and that was it/
[0:05:34] <%greatmuta2> apatDab U B I S O F T apatDab
[0:05:35] <Justin_Wood> Watch Dogs Legion was good, but everything else wasn't pretty bad
[0:05:36] <%lord_traxis> No WOOO guy?
[0:05:36] <M4eta> but NOT poilitical
[0:05:36] <Daebunz> watchdogs was cool then zzzzz then it ended abruptly

[0:05:37] <sjcodan> Wii IS STILL GETTING GAMES IN 2020
[0:05:37] <TheBlankAce> That was the right call, it was worse than other Ubi conferences
[0:05:37] <rufus2k2> Pepperidge Farms remembers
[0:05:38] <%Keaton_x> Watch Dogs Legion looked cool though. Not much else aside from that..
[0:05:38] <CptBritches> But do you regret not streaming the Pre Pre Show's Mortal Kombat stage play?
[0:05:38] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Russian Badger was good though
[0:05:39] <Xiangchang> It was EA boring.
[0:05:39] <%ssjklyco> @angriestpat Tom Clancy has wrote more dead that Grrm did alive
[0:05:39] <%DXLelouch24> poor Matt will never get Prince of Persia
[0:05:39] <+PenmanLupine> Watch Dogs Legion looks alright
[0:05:39] <Rikuo86> But Com Tlancy
[0:05:39] <%GohanEgret> watch dogs looked cool, and I'm curious about Gods and Monsters, but that was it
[0:05:40] <+sparkjavelin> japanese woman was pretty cute though
[0:05:40] <+Hotmemes420> ubi sucked
[0:05:40] <grayjammer> Grandma was the o9nly good part

[0:05:43] <SilverFaustX> spin the sofa
[0:05:43] <%CJett92> Ubistream killed Clemps
[0:05:43] <%HiroTSK5> There wasn't even any mention of Pirates
[0:05:43] <%cvp5127> NOT POLITICAL
[0:05:45] <+aivalera> You would’ve made alot of muns though
[0:05:46] <%sshen> Shoulda streamed pre pre show
[0:05:47] <coreybom> watch dogs looks cool though.

[0:05:49] <%GohanEgret> B R E X I T
[0:05:49] <+Jaysky> There was a single game with gameplay. Watch Dogs looked ok but YOU KNOW UBI, it's probably fake.
[0:05:49] <%Ultradoom333> so apparently theres gonna be an FF8 remaster with changes to the junction system and the removal of leveled enemies
[0:05:49] <+djbrooks603> We watched cat vids over on clemps stream

[1:03:32] <%Rumbutt> FF7 is, how do you say? A tough act to follow
[1:03:32] <mr_slaide> I can't masturbate to this.
[1:03:32] <InugamiTheHound> square Fenix start off with a grand slam with ff7 remake stuff
[1:03:32] <%Frost_Quill> Yeah FF7R should have been the last trailer. Unless they've got something else.
[1:03:33] <MegaFangKing23> True

[1:03:34] <iaracatunda> maybe the end is good
[1:03:34] <+viewingshades> Unfortunately they started the show with a show stopper and we can all go home.
[1:03:34] <HarraceHarrison> This is the real attraction, FF7 is lame
[1:03:35] <%spiritofmojave> this just goes on and on
[1:03:35] <worldbrand> Maybe they have another showstopper
[1:03:35] <gigacanuck> oh boy, farming Kappa
[1:03:35] <%republicofu> shouldn't have startied with 7

[1:03:38] <whycans> people like farming
[1:03:38] <kakdela7> they need to close with taro
[1:03:39] <SoaringLettuce> they might end with avengers
[1:03:39] <+jojodigitalartist> To be fair they won with that alone

[1:04:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat's just gonna build a biiiiiiig weiner
[1:04:21] <Macmo696> I cans see this appealing to someone, and that someone is not me
[1:04:21] <gustavozxd> cause slimes are cool
[1:04:21] <missmariefanart> slime is mascot
[1:04:22] <%tigerfang86> because SHUT UP Pat
[1:04:22] <worldbrand> their imagination is slime
[1:04:22] <DocMadfox> They aren't very imaginative, Pat.
[1:04:22] <martmartez> shut up
[1:04:22] <+BlainPLD> This is going on for a really long time
[1:04:22] <%evilmagetim> slimes tho
[1:04:23] <$SGrim> They all look like Toriyama's take on Lalafels rooREE
[1:04:23] <AmericanaRed> THEY CANT SHOW DICKS

[1:04:23] <Ravoric> ONLY MEEEEE
[1:04:23] <Ephexos101> onle me? :)
[1:04:24] <%MightyMarlowe> All imagination leads to slimes
[1:04:24] <D3rrtyD4n> that is the limit of your imagination pat

[1:04:24] <+J_PewPew> Botw
[1:04:24] <+BorinCorran> Certainly looks like a fun time if you're into this sort of game.
[1:04:25] <+MintMuffinGamer> Can we build a giant robot?

[1:04:25] <madogod> sbfpSOB sbfpSOB sbfpSOB

[1:04:27] <%Cthulos> Because Dragon Quest
[1:04:27] <qo_op> seems better than i thought, but still not interested
[1:04:27] <%these_pockets> this voice actor is killing me
[1:04:27] <%cdrom321> Because that's THEY'RE imagination.
[1:04:27] <xtremegamer80> This narrator is hammy as fuck
[1:04:28] <electricelephantsonparade> seems like squenix is really trying to coast on the Final Fantasy hype for the rest of the show
[1:04:28] <+DoctorDerp388> only i can defeat the children
[1:04:28] <+zcrawford22> because slimes are the limit of all imagination
[1:04:28] <LegendaryDorkKnight> How about you build a fun game

[1:04:31] <VennyVentus> In their defense most of these games are actually interesting at the very least as opposed to the other presentations so far.
[1:04:31] <UnfilteredComic> This guy is so dramatic
[1:04:32] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> jesus this trailer never ends
[1:04:32] <damienlunas> Dragon Quest isn't known for being imaginative

[1:04:37] <%Emperor_Machinus> Because the limit of imagination is slime duh
[1:04:37] <%crimsonharvest> In the actual plot of these games the building is pretty mellow and not the focus

[1:28:37] <+Kduff89> ok cool i guess

[1:28:40] <jarf100> ok. that was kinda cool tho
[1:28:40] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I don't even know what trash they publish that they don't make.
[1:28:41] <%crimsonharvest> didnt show anything but whatever
[1:28:41] <Fuzz_331> this would've been shown at the ps4 one or something like that and was shoved off here
[1:28:41] <transporterthesequel> It's a Destiny!
[1:28:41] <missmariefanart> it's a conference for industry people
[1:28:41] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @angriestpat that's why they started with FF7 probably
[1:28:41] <$BuoyantSoul> Sure?
[1:28:41] <+Pookiedaexzile> "Another Shooter" Fuck off,
[1:28:41] <%BrazenMask> And???????????

[1:28:42] <AzureSkyKnight> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[1:28:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat but the ony reason they ahve their spot is because of their publisher status
[1:28:42] <Polarix64> This looks too serious to be Bulletstorm 2
[1:28:43] <Aydarkzero> neat
[1:28:43] <+kira2993> Kappa //

[1:28:47] <Stark_snow> eurojank?
[1:28:47] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat you're telling me that didn't look cool?

[1:44:58] <Takanub> You know you don't really want that PAT
[1:44:58] <%RayDaug> @AngriestPat this way makes it less of a licensing nightmare. The game won't get PT'ed this way
[1:44:59] <missmariefanart> yeah pat like they have a couple million for each avenger
[1:44:59] <shotgunspaghetti> dude hyped that shit up for years and showed that. THAT was a MASSIVE let down of a trailer.

[1:45:01] <bear_breaker20> this is test
[1:45:02] <3xgilly> Yeah your correct
[1:45:02] <falseeyed> But they did
[1:45:02] <+the_red_comet_uc> Yuri did a good job tho
[1:45:02] <Derkinstacker> Troy baker cloned, and playing all characters
[1:45:03] <Tennochief> LUL
[1:45:03] <%Dr00_PhD> They've been the cartoon avengers for years
[1:45:03] <+J_PewPew> Is this ff7 still
[1:45:04] <+Eddy21forsaken> they can't afford them
[1:45:04] <1CalamityMad> Naw
[1:45:04] <%CerberusDriver> This isn't the MCU Pat
[1:45:04] <+AMUSERNAME> We've known these characters for a DECADE SwiftRage
[1:45:04] <+RestiveGaming> WE got the best VOICE ACTOR cast
[1:45:04] <PhantaniumOG> Don't make the game then
[1:45:04] <Delenay> could afford
[1:45:04] <%stagemage> dont draw attention to it is all
[1:45:04] <%kenpachi9211> @AngriestPat roster teeth don't say to much
[1:45:05] <+Trair> this looks lke a game we wouldve gotten pre-MCU
[1:45:05] <+combomaniadeluxe> THEY ARE
[1:45:05] <%RilsRislan> Just ask Disney to give it to you
[1:45:05] <Nobosy287> we spent no money
[1:45:05] <horny_guts> Tru
[1:45:05] <+NickyDynamite> RDJ costs like fifty million
[1:45:06] <%averyoddjew> i mean, they kinda did
[1:45:06] <Prevot> they spared no expense
[1:45:06] <+jayfigga> They are the best
[1:45:07] <missmariefanart> don't be fucking stupid
[1:45:07] <Mr__Jebus> but they did tho
[1:45:07] <+jojodigitalartist> Actors are not the same as voice actors though
[1:45:07] <+ryujinran> they didn't really say that though
[1:45:07] <%evilmagetim> exactly
[1:45:07] <%EmiinV> One thing to consider is that these guys have been doing the voices for the animated series for years
[1:45:08] <+Nomicro4u> The best cast we could afford with a budget of 100 dollars
[1:45:08] <+kira2993> it is the best cast they could afford tho
[1:45:08] <joeyjojo70> They did...
[1:45:08] <+Darren716> This IS what they got afford
[1:45:09] <+Xeno351> they're good voice actors
[1:45:09] <WreckItRaz> Why does it have to be based on the MCU?
[1:45:10] <demetristerling> yeah, because getting hollywood actors always worked out for the quality of the voice acting *cough*PeterDinklage*cough*
[1:45:10] <psychic117> holy shot
[1:45:10] <+johnchikr> They are the most expensive VA's tho
[1:45:10] <$crown_clown22> crazy talk that
[1:45:11] <%PalmtopNami> so tom Holland shoulda played spiderman?
[1:45:11] <%darthgeldof> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:45:11] <zajoestar> STUFF
[1:45:11] <metalwater8> They did
[1:45:11] <maverickdrifter> The right option was Ultimate Alliance 3
[1:45:11] <Sk8t3> Gameplay doesnt exist anymore now?
[1:45:11] <Jsutton1254> they can't afford that tho
[1:45:11] <CandideCamera> they can't avoid the movies, sure, but they picked the absolute most generic voice actors
[1:45:12] <TonberryKingx> oooooooooooooooooof
[1:45:12] <qo_op> it also wont make the game good, just burning massive cash
[1:45:12] <Nina96> they wouldn't do it pat
[1:45:12] <Louie_Salmon> But if they got the actors it would sell a bunch more
[1:45:12] <+combomaniadeluxe> PAT
[1:45:12] <%gusdabus91> bro roy mustang is sitting there
[1:45:13] <%Typhaeon> Go listen to Liam Neeson in Ponyo and tell me the AAA actors = good voice actors
[1:45:13] <Serge_12> Is this Marvel Project a MMO?
[1:45:14] <%Validuntil2077> These guys are a-list for VAs though
[1:45:14] <Monkeyweed21> round table with NO GAMEPLAY
[1:45:14] <+HandPicked> ResidentSleeper
[1:45:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Ya know what, I'm gonna give this game a chance
[1:45:15] <+ryujinran> how else would they present it?
[1:45:15] <%Skrypto> @AngriestPat Where is Paige?
[1:45:15] <%Ahack13> Also, who cares? Its not MCU
[1:45:15] <$HeroToxiko> The 5 Kings of voice acting
[1:45:16] <martmartez> disney has the money, they own everything
[1:45:16] <@lewdskeletor13> ITS A VIDEO GAME PAT
[1:45:16] <3xgilly> this just looks bad
[1:45:16] <Dr_Mooose> we got the best...that we could get
[1:45:16] <%Baesel20xx> Plus the majority of those actors are super done with being the avengers
[1:45:16] <turretgunz> Pat why are you whinning?
[1:45:17] <+DoctorDerp388> THIS IS QUIET MAN 2
[1:45:18] <FriendlyLich> We got the SCUFFED AVENGERS LUL
[1:45:18] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> sigh, so much cynicism
[1:45:18] <+mobius_won> This game will make megabucks tho
[1:45:18] <KevWasHere95> This is literally the best Voice Actor cast they could have gotten Pat
[1:45:18] <%boomstarprime> this is probably gonna be the end of crystal dynamics :\
[1:45:18] <mistersups> These are the voice actors for everything not movie related. Animation, games, etc.
[1:45:18] <KingKZ> Legit pissed Hawkeye is not here
[1:45:18] <eldritchart> travis voices most thors, and bailey is his wife
[1:45:19] <tuftecake> you know who has more money than anyone? fucking Disney/Marvel!
[1:45:19] <Eltruis> But they did get the best cast they can AFFORD
[1:45:19] <$spardanwarrior> Because that worked so well for Destiny with Dinklage
[1:45:19] <%AstroFalcon09> LUL
[1:45:19] <Bailey__gaming> spared some expense
[1:45:19] <Kefos_> :/ :/ :/
[1:45:19] <Drunkengen> They picked a cast thats half the price of those actors
[1:45:20] <+BryantZiggs> they probably never planned on getting the MCU cast
[1:45:20] <Cactuskris> why are so down about this
[1:45:20] <r_Foeburden87> All these peps do Anime too
[1:45:20] <+merylinspants> these guys have cool voices but they aren't facially interesting so them as superheroes doesn't translate
[1:45:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> despite your moaning, Pat.
[1:45:21] <+Eddy21forsaken> YOU"RE DEAD
[1:45:21] <poweredscoot> Disney says no money in games
[1:45:21] <Juilce> what the hell are you saying pat?
[1:45:21] <Medo3G> yuri was good in spiderman tho
[1:45:21] <$CharlesRobinJr> Marvel alliance 3 looks better
[1:45:21] <%BayowolfTerra> yeah this is weird.
[1:45:21] <+HyperCharge_Sam> LUL
[1:45:21] <$crown_clown22> s expensive and all that money is going to FF7
[1:45:21] <VirgilXII> Only the movies are real
[1:45:21] <Binarypony> this is an avengers game, why cheap out?
[1:45:21] <%alcors_wisdom> really should have dropped this like a year after endgame honestly
[1:45:21] <Bullet_In_Chronostasis> can we move on
[1:45:22] <Dementedpenguin> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:45:22] <haveswordmuststing> honestly 2 members of critical role is better than everyone in the avengers Kappa
[1:45:22] <+Shaggnar> I mean at this point Troy Baker is expensive enough
[1:45:22] <%LouieRouie> They got the guys who are in everything
[1:45:22] <1CalamityMad> That’s unnecessary
[1:45:22] <Theeconomicnerd> Travis loves Fat Thor
[1:45:22] <Savoisdead> We need content
[1:45:23] <missingangle> But Pat they're are good ;-;
[1:45:23] <Pompadourius> Ultimate Alliance 3 is better.
[1:45:23] <nobody12349> This game would've been great in 2013
[1:45:23] <+the_red_comet_uc> but Pat, Yuri did good
[1:45:23] <$Falcerys> whiny whiny little man
[1:45:24] <bearwagon> but maybe they did get the best that they could afford, it just wasnt very good? i guess
[1:45:24] <+Pookiedaexzile> If this was teh best Cast tehy could afford Phill LAmar would be on it
[1:45:24] <%R0bobot> they're good VOs
[1:45:24] <gotanysnacks> If it's not gonna be the movie actors HAVE LIKE 50 AVENGERS
[1:45:24] <%spinalwizard> Have you been watching this?
[1:45:24] <%BeatH7> @AngriestPat u crazy they cost too much? also it is still the best they could afford even if it's not the movie actors
[1:45:24] <cheesedburgers> Yuri Lowenthall came from anime and he got to be spiderman
[1:45:24] <+Austinck> they got troy baker broderland 3 didn't
[1:45:24] <justindgbz> Hey look, it's the only VAs who ever get hired
[1:45:25] <%Cervantas> Pat the contracts for the MCU don't cover games, they are fucking expensive, and most of their contracts are done
[1:45:25] <Drunkengen> Cap died
[1:45:25] <%discouragedoblong> RDJ alone would be the price of the game
[1:45:25] <%Diabetic> One the cool things about Cap, he's alive.
[1:45:25] <saltytyrz> They voice them in animated stuff bro
[1:45:26] <KatabolicRage> robert downey junior would've done this if they asked honestly
[1:45:26] <missmariefanart> why is this comic book video game not like the movie
[1:45:26] <+reiju_22> the marvel game on switch will be better and cost 1/10 of it
[1:45:26] <DocMadfox> Pat, I love your content. But you dumb
[1:45:26] <$spleekle> Look at these scuffed avengers LUL
[1:45:26] <%CerberusDriver> THIS ISNT THE MCU PAT

[1:45:46] <Wedge_Mantilles> The art style is too close to being the mcu, without being the same actors, that's the problem.

[1:53:26] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Are there any other things happening in E3?
[1:53:27] <%brave_sj> All they needed to do was swap Avengers and FF7 and we would have been left with FUCK YEAH instead of 6/10 Not Spiderman 2
[1:53:27] <ProtoShawk> 60 Hour work weeks inbound
[1:53:28] <tag545> devs be like OH THATS THE GAME

[1:53:37] <%Gespens> Is Iron Man gonna teach us a goddamn infinitee?
[1:53:37] <bxdragon> FF7 was nice and got some stuff on FF14. Otherwise I don't give a fuck.
[1:53:37] <%evilmagetim> crunch babies behind tinydeals
[1:53:37] <%ElenaManetta> They said there's a demo there though?
[1:53:37] <dekkitout> How do you drop the ball harder than Starlord in Infinity War?
[1:53:37] <TwinBat> It's real because it wasn't impressive
[1:53:37] <bestwaifuritsu> rip Triple Triad lovers, your game is relegated to a shitty texture mod now LUL
[1:53:38] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> With shitty graphics they can churns this these like nothing
[1:53:38] <%valkuma> my favorite part of the marvel game was none of it was gameplay.
[1:53:38] <%megabrogus> pat youre too negative
[1:53:38] <+emeraldstreak> what looks bad about it to you?

[1:53:40] <$Corporate_Redeemer> WHEN'S ANTHEM
[1:53:40] <%THATGUY_789> PlayStation was right to skip
[1:53:40] <poweredscoot> Marvel is going to kill Square again
[1:53:41] <+Tugs_Keng> ffxiv
[1:53:42] <+Roundelay11> I think you're being unreasonably down on it
[1:53:42] <+JEiddew> i won't see, i'm gonna fucking forget lmao
[1:53:42] <+rcand9> killzone
[1:53:43] <gustavozxd> as real as tomb raider gameplay so not really real
[1:53:43] <%apostateCourier> yea but shadowbringers tho
[1:53:43] <Grandpa_Ironside> nah they just opened that new slave farm, i mean studio
[1:53:43] <Grunkle_Dan_> We all know you're never wrong, Pat :P
[1:53:43] <Them00n> Crystal Dynamics is a bad studio, I can say that with confidence now. @AngriestPat
[1:53:44] <masso101> Can’t wait for sense of right as a service schlooter
[1:53:44] <+purelyplum> Remember doom tho
[1:53:44] <supersamzero> snoreeee
[1:53:44] <%michingmallecho> It’s a fake
[1:53:46] <Mentalninja27> It looks weird

[1:53:46] <%vampireinarm> its REALly fake
[1:53:46] <%Pappajimbo> crunch babys in the crunch tubes
[1:53:48] <lotharrio> Being multiplayer isn't a good thing for that sort of game. Who wants to play Widow when Hulk and Thor are around?
[1:53:48] <Monkeyweed21> PAT HATES FF14 I GUESS
[1:53:48] <%Sovspot> Is it objective fact that e3 is just getting worse and will eventually die in the near future?
[1:53:48] <GyroBrando> It looked like shit and if its real its even worse
[1:53:49] <waifoong98> This is AWFUL
[1:53:49] <%LouieRouie> Real cutscenes maybe
[1:53:49] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> lukewarm 7/10

[1:53:50] <CandideCamera> Pat you seem real old and salty this year
[1:53:50] <%IzazaOzihaha> Avengers looked good, and I'm not even a fan.
[1:53:51] <17sevens> Pat they'll just crunch so that it comes out. That works good for live service games, right?
[1:53:51] <+InstiGaitan> There was a tiny bit of gameplay?
[1:53:52] <Rikuo86> Where was the gameplay then Chat?
[1:53:52] <+kyh9> I need to see some actual gameplay, with fucking HUD elements.
[1:53:52] <Louie_Salmon> Licenced games are always rushed for some reason
[1:53:52] <Nina96> @angriestpat ff14
[1:53:52] <%cvp5127> boi did it
[1:53:53] <%Emperor_Machinus> Fake news

[1:53:53] <%Solidnick18> man
[1:53:54] <%aperez928> That was totally real Pat, what the fuck are you talking about '
[1:53:55] <emeraldskrull> Pat needs to stop being a coward and start supporting the Raptors!
[1:53:56] <$monkeyhous3> looked like shit
[1:53:56] <Will_The_Soulless> Yeah that starting really high up there
[1:53:56] <maverickdrifter> Ultimate Alliance 3
[1:53:57] <Alcanator> You’re not real pat
[1:53:57] <Shwepie> Everytime there were particle effects the FPS tanked. It hurt to watch.
[1:53:57] <%BestTeaMaker> nintendo wins by default
[1:53:57] <1CalamityMad> Yeah giving it to square was a mistake
[1:53:58] <Bodypop_> Is this the worst E3 overall?
[1:53:59] <DatAsuna> Fake MCU
[1:53:59] <OswaldTheDog> boring as HELL
[1:53:59] <%b0neh34d> More like Marvel Anthem
[1:53:59] <worldbrand> Babylon's Fall's website said 2019, man. Should I even hope for TGS?

[1:54:04] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> "Not actual gameplay"
[1:54:04] <OswaldTheDog> it looked boring as HELL

[1:54:05] <%megabrogus> dont give a shit how it looks if it plays well
[1:54:05] <+VVardy> This E3 is so meeh
[1:54:05] <+Pookiedaexzile> Ultimate Anthem 3
[1:54:06] <%machshop> tony stark looked like fuckin grizzly adams
[1:54:06] <DevilDeus13> Looks as quality as their current comics :(
[1:54:06] <+Rorinator> @AngriestPat I just want to fly around as iron man and jump around as hulk like you can swing around as spiderman. That's all I want

[1:54:36] <%depressed_skeleton> @AngriestPat DSP is giving some hot takes saying FF7 looks like shit.

[1:54:54] <wickedends> Tifa's truer to her initial design than the render back in the day, if you want tig o biddies tifa just search google
[1:54:54] <xmetalicdemonx> I did think we would get parasite eve and it was my fault for being surprised.

[2:20:57] <Nina96> if the epic store was good and stopped taking every single game as a pc exclusive people wouldn't be as mad
[2:21:01] <Graywolf_the_45th> it's a fucking mobile game
[2:21:03] <+LottonTheWizard> MOBILE GAME
[2:21:04] <$Valdorick> Isn't FF7 a kids game!?
[2:21:06] <%sshen> Avengers seems FUCKING WEIRD CONSIDERING MUA3 IS A THING
[2:21:06] <ShadowNovaDez> mobile pay trash
[2:21:09] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Mobile garbo yo, that alone is enough
[2:21:10] <+AMUSERNAME> They'll kill her 3 times, once per disc LUL
[2:21:11] <missingangle> You don't have to really understand the original to know the problem was that it's MOBILE
[2:21:15] <%cvp5127> @CommanderSqueaks she's a ghost
[2:21:17] <a_mad_dragon> goodbye galaxy is episode 4, not the first
[2:21:19] <Ion_Laser> There were NO MICROTRANSACTIONS IS MS-DOS GAMES
[2:21:26] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Aeonleon) (warning)

[2:21:29] <falseeyed> The Dead Aerith Everywhere System
[2:21:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> @cvp5127 She's a lifestream
[2:21:32] <%seraphimjordan> remember the time hank pym HIT the shit out of his wife
[2:21:36] <%brave_sj> Well the new one looks like fucking garbage gameplay-wise so that's why I hate it
[2:21:37] <czeekyplays> I remember having it on floppy disks!
[2:21:37] <Finakala> I played one of them when I was super young, it was fun
[2:21:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> Commander keen is super hype
[2:21:41] <$cureneckbeard> GBC
[2:21:46] <Finakala> THE DOPEFISH LIVES
[2:21:47] <derpicus506> commander keen was one of my first games I played
[2:21:48] <VJdarkworld> BUT lootbox game to exploit children tho!!!
[2:21:49] <%Agami23> who cares if they were kids games??
[2:21:50] <%hussdogrob> published by Id--BY Bethesda Software
[2:21:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> But the mobile relaunch is trash
[2:21:54] <go_aheat_muster_jostur> sure grandma
[2:21:58] <starlitalpha> now keen has been shit on
[2:21:58] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> @commandersqueaks Isn’t that that soda carbonated machine?
[2:22:00] <Aeonleon> Fate worse than death F
[2:22:00] <derpicus506> so good
[2:22:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You know there actually is a way to raise aeris from the dead in FF7, too, it just involves using controller 2
[2:22:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "back in my day"
[2:22:07] <%cvp5127> CONSUME
[2:22:09] <majindusto> Commander Keen was Great...Then Bethesda Killed It BibleThump
[2:22:09] <Shwepie> @AngriestPat Commander Keen game feels like some bean counter watched an AGDQ and saw an IP they owned but weren't milking.
[2:22:09] <%spiritofmojave> Gacha is a sad death for that
[2:22:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MrSuperCasualBoom She's a soda
[2:22:12] <%AstroFalcon09> yep
[2:22:15] <derpicus506> what if your a 25 year old child?
[2:22:19] <+Darren716> Its not for kids tho...
[2:22:20] <Nina96> i haven't "its a kids game" in a long time
[2:22:20] <%AstroFalcon09> it's the ea tactic
[2:22:22] <haveswordmuststing> its like those gacha apps of slightly obscure IPs like Star Ocean and Langrisser
[2:22:22] <+AMUSERNAME> Hit Triangle at any point in combat to KILL AERITH LUL PogChamp
[2:22:23] <%cTAKU> I think Game Grumps made it relevant
[2:22:28] <Balsty> what game?
[2:22:29] <starlitalpha> "they trusted us with the license"= they offered us mobile money
[2:22:30] <%hussdogrob> Gamble for the children
[2:22:31] <Ion_Laser> This generation of kids should not be introduced to Commander Keen with this moblie game with microtransactions
[2:22:31] <+Darren716> The theme song literally has FUck in it
[2:22:34] <Vyctorian> Any license can come back in any format
[2:22:34] <%sshen> @angriestpat considering the previous lore about Keen being the father to Doomguy, would that not make Billy said doomguy
[2:22:35] <%Invlux> Commander Character Assasination
[2:22:37] <haveswordmuststing> just put the name out there
[2:22:37] <falseeyed> EXACTLY
[2:22:38] <%spiritofmojave> Think of the children while you gamble
[2:22:39] <ZComiX> i see
[2:22:40] <KamelGuru> Looks like it has _nothing_ of the soul of the originals
[2:22:41] <haveswordmuststing> someone will notice
[2:22:44] <%crimsonharvest> Commander Keen wasn't even fun when it was new
[2:22:55] <dandyspider> pat doesn't like it because the kids are basically him and paige
[2:22:57] <MrCalieb> NSP are playing in my town in october i gotta go
[2:22:58] <%yoshkosh20> which game? I stepped out for a bit
[2:22:59] <jimmytwofeet> PAT I OVE YOU
[2:23:01] <falseeyed> No IP is allowed to fade away in grace
[2:23:03] <MrCalieb> that wasn't relevant
[2:23:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> so everyday
[2:23:11] <Finakala> So every day
[2:23:12] <%hussdogrob> @mrcalieb I'll see you there sir
[2:23:13] <%spiritofmojave> But that's everyday!
[2:23:13] <$Valdorick> Bethesda, never look at EA and go "We can one up that."
[2:23:17] <%weissguard> LUL
[2:23:18] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> pat you sound tired
[2:23:21] <Ion_Laser> Tom Hall has been trying to make a new Commander Keen game for years. And Bethesda decides to do a lame duck mobile game
[2:23:21] <haveswordmuststing> @falseeyed Vagrant Story kinda did Kappa
[2:23:23] <+Artimadare> I'm sensing a theme
[2:23:25] <%D33TR> get your girl mcdonalds and she cant run away
[2:23:27] <mr_slaide> Bitches loooove McDonalds.
[2:23:27] <ProRJHunter> LUL
[2:23:27] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat you know you're just feeding the addiction right?
[2:23:32] <%Validuntil2077> the WcDonalds everywhere system
[2:23:34] <Dr_Mooose> bitches loves WcDonalds
[2:23:35] <Smart_ZaK1> Paige is so spoiled lol
[2:23:35] <Vyctorian> Well hopefully she has less bad Mcdonald's days and more good ones
[2:23:36] <MrCalieb> rip rooster teeth west also
[2:23:36] <Nina96> @AngriestPat whats the story on WcDonalds?
[2:23:38] <+Promessa_EX> i use base 16

[2:23:47] <sjcodan> BASE 8?
[2:23:48] <+jerree66> But no tho
[2:23:48] <Finakala> Which is more addicted, Pat with Redbull or Paige with McD's and mustard?
[2:23:48] <Captain_Aham> sounds like commie talk
[2:23:49] <%Wynzler> Does she love killing women and children or WcDonalds more
[2:23:49] <%yoshkosh20> mickey Ds
[2:23:50] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@helpmeimafruit) (warning)
[2:23:53] <+lethallunacyx> yes the superior way
[2:23:54] <%sshen> Trying to sleep and my fukken cat keeps trying to eat plastic
[2:23:55] <a_mad_dragon> base 60 is the god tier one
[2:23:56] <%CJett92> !uptime
[2:23:56] <%ares92822> what ?
[2:23:56] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 23m.
[2:23:58] <MrCalieb> VVymyns Day is every day
[2:24:02] <mr_slaide> Pat, stop. The Americans love their shitty, dumb system.
[2:24:04] <ringabal> 28 STAB WOUNDS
[2:24:05] <%GohanEgret> @Nina96 pat and paige made fun of how mcdonalds turned the M upside down to celebrate women
[2:24:07] <King_Wolf_Rigger> As a 'MURICAN I can agree that the metric system is fine.
[2:24:07] <Jermatoo> LUL
[2:24:10] <%Alazull> As a cook I swear to god fuck ounces, cups, quarts and gallons
[2:24:10] <+Promessa_EX> i played 999 so i know all about base 16
[2:24:11] <Ion_Laser> :D
[2:24:12] <nobody12349> It makes brain hurt because I can't see how big a meter is in my head
[2:24:12] <%spiritofmojave> you're not far off
[2:24:13] <Triplicat> ™️
[2:24:17] <%hussdogrob> @finakala Paige because Pat has occasionally used Coke
[2:24:19] <%BayowolfTerra> it's easy but if you haven't had your whole life its hard to adapt.
[2:24:20] <+joekuta71> @AngriestPat There any burger chains in Canada in the vein of In n Out or White Castle?
[2:24:21] <%brave_sj> Yeah but metric is a stupid name meanwhile our is called IMPERIAL which is COOL
[2:24:25] <Nina96> @GohanEgret k thx
[2:24:26] <$MrDrayko> I DONT WANT TO BE THO
