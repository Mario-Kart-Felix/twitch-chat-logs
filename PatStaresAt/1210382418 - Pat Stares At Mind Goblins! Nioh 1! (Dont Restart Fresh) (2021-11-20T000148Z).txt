[0:00:33] <@StreamElements> PatStaresAt is now live! Streaming Nioh: Pat Stares At Mind Goblins! Nioh 1! (Don't Restart Fresh)
[0:00:47] <%daemonazaezal> First?
[0:00:55] <%Broand> oh boy I enjoy nioh
[0:00:58] <%JoshManVGH> Defeat the goblins!
[0:01:00] <%Broand> also second
[0:01:05] <+zanz_san> Good evening Pat and chat shizur6Gg VoteYea
[0:01:07] <%baka_sugoi> H E L L O
[0:01:12] <%Broand> Technically they're called "bakemono"
[0:01:13] <%RealThiele> Nioh goblins
[0:01:20] <Madinki> Welp, Live action Cowboy Bepop
[0:01:23] <%daemonazaezal> Nioh is how you do a combat tested game with player input
[0:01:23] <Madinki> It sucked
[0:01:30] <youngking_kush> #PatWillFigureItOut ?
[0:01:36] <%Treuan> Cheer500 Howdy
[0:01:40] <%RealThiele> so is it a NG+ run if we not starting fresh? or is this like an abandoned save file
[0:01:41] <%barrakuta371> Nioh Sporin
[0:01:43] <@MistyMntns> What up my peopleeeeee
[0:01:46] <+zanz_san> Nioh 1 and 2 we're definitely one game at one point
[0:01:47] <%RayReborne> time to load up the 6th mission or something Kappa
[0:01:49] <%baka_sugoi> psaBlind BLINDNESS
[0:02:03] <%Saadi90> I love the Nioh games so much
[0:02:11] <+Orcapugs> No mid/maxing Mr Stares At
[0:02:17] <@Ranryu692> @RealThiele abandoned save file
[0:02:27] <youngking_kush> @zanz_san IDK about that one, they definitely built alot off Nioh 1 feedback with 2
[0:02:28] <+zanz_san> Like basically Foreigner William is western Nioh while half oni boy is the eastern Nioh
[0:02:31] <%RealThiele> oh man i hate abandoned save files
[0:02:31] <srv4254> yeyeyeyeye
[0:02:38] <%JoshManVGH> @realthiele I think it's an abandoned save. Pat mentioned before that he didn't get far due to item information overload.
[0:02:41] <%Bt_Robot> Bt_Robot subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! Yo Pat, you want to talk about Mind Goblins, did you know a speedrunning community rose up around Omikron mainly because of your playthrough on the old channel?  The current record is around 1:30 and skips almost all fighting and shooting sections.
[0:02:42] <%RayReborne> Nioh is so good man. i wanted to get the ps5 version for my return to beat nioh 1 but it wont go on sale lol
[0:02:57] <%RayReborne> i want my 60 fps
[0:02:59] <youngking_kush> Nioh 2 is so fucking good man, it's actually crazy
[0:03:04] <%RayReborne> i NEEDS it
[0:03:05] <+0dinpen> I didnt think there would be a mind goblins for this lol
[0:03:13] <%justcallmebobplease> justcallmebobplease subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 15 month streak! Good luck with Nioh, and try to do cool anime shit as often as possible no matter how often you eat it or how underoptimized you feel - just bust it out!
[0:03:19] <+DeadlyPeaks> @rayreborne checkout BestBuy
[0:03:21] <+zanz_san> Oh yeah ps+ is $40 right now
[0:03:26] <~PatStaresAt> Nioh 1 is literally the game that inspired the mind goblins series @0dinpen
[0:03:27] <%Dakuu75> How do you do, fellow kids?
[0:03:28] <defaultname3887> nioh 2 is so good that nioh one is literally inside of it
[0:03:32] <%RealThiele> starting a save after years of ignoring it definite can spark goblins with not having any idea what is going on
[0:03:33] <%President_Miyazaki> President_Miyazaki subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 43 months! I love Nioh. Decent challenge that you can get through with just an idea of a build and random bullshit gear, until you get to Way of the Nioh, where it turns fucking impossible unless you have your gear perfected.
[0:03:33] <+zanz_san> gotta get that
[0:03:35] <%RayReborne> @youngking_kush My big titty OC agrees with you
[0:03:44] <artoflec> This is it, the final boss of Goblin
[0:03:48] <%RayReborne> @youngking_kush Nioh 2 oc i mean
[0:03:48] <cartakus> Oda did nothing wrong
[0:03:55] <%SWFanatic> Should I watch Pat play Nioh or Tim Rogers play Pokemon?
[0:04:01] <%Dakuu75> So this is not a New-Game start. he's booting up an old save?
[0:04:08] <youngking_kush> @rayreborne I either run around as big tittu OC or Madara Uchiha
[0:04:19] <youngking_kush> There is no in-between lol
[0:04:26] <%RealThiele> @Dakuu75 yea
[0:04:32] <%chance_h> Pat, Pog
[0:04:46] <Profmcstevie> This is resuming a long forgotten file goblin
[0:04:48] <%RayReborne> @youngking_kush omg i should look up a tutorial to make Naruto characters in Nioh 2 now for the fuck of it Kappa
[0:04:49] <%baka_sugoi> Oda Noubunaga is a waifu
[0:04:53] <%zeroarturia> I love nioh but man it can be rough coming back after awhile of not playing
[0:04:54] <%IronOhki> IronOhki subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! Three damn years. I'd say something snarky but nah. Pat is just a great video game man to watch.
[0:05:08] <cartakus> So what weapons you guys main?
[0:05:18] <+zanz_san> I played Nioh so much that I encountered Hank squads in multiplayer
[0:05:21] <%baka_sugoi> orb
[0:05:22] <oda_flobunaga> Fists for life
[0:05:23] <youngking_kush> @rayreborne Bro just Google Nioh 2 Naruto Creation Codes
[0:05:25] <+zanz_san> gank
[0:05:29] <%IronOhki> I know nothing of Nioh, other than it's kind of souls-like. This'll be my introduction.
[0:05:30] <%Dakuu75> I always used the big katana, "Odachi" I think
[0:05:35] <ovan20> fist and tonfa
[0:05:36] <youngking_kush> Katana + Fists
[0:05:39] <%thbluewarden> thbluewarden subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Howdy Pat. well, 13 months eh? what a wacky year it's been. how're you folks doing? did you happen to see the the new total warhammer trailer? we got nurgle now!
[0:05:55] <+enternius> The Nioh 2 hatchets are amazing
[0:06:04] <%RayReborne> @cartakus Kusarigama and Sword/dual swords in Nioh 1. in two i was BIG Tonfa and Switchglaive/kusarigama
[0:06:06] <artoflec> @IronOhki in the sense that you drop your "souls" and pick em up but thats about it, its mission based like ninja gaiden, and you actually still have money separate from souls
[0:06:15] <%valriot> I like all weapon, cos 600 hours, but Katana, Odachi and GUN TONFA are always peak
[0:06:16] <+zanz_san> I.was katana and sickle and ninjitsu
[0:06:18] <%BaronVonJarvis> BaronVonJarvis subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[0:06:20] <oda_flobunaga> I doubt Pat's going to get to my namesake tonight if ever.
[0:06:21] <%JoshManVGH> Odachi + Axe for Nioh, and did some Glaive + Staff for Nioh 2.
[0:06:22] <+DeadlyPeaks> Anyone know if them new pokeymans are good?
[0:06:23] <%RealThiele> also there are pokemon in nioh
[0:06:25] <%RayReborne> Fists are super fun but SUPER BUSTED
[0:06:26] <+zanz_san> I was
[0:06:31] <Profmcstevie> Nioh is the truest soulslite
[0:06:32] <%IronOhki> @artoflec Cool
[0:06:37] <%Saadi90> Switchglaive and Magic!
[0:06:41] <artoflec> Spear is canonically the most powerful
[0:06:41] <%zeroarturia> wait can pat access the extra weapons like the odachi?
[0:06:45] <+zanz_san> I hate typing on phone so much
[0:06:48] <%RayReborne> Fists are so fucking busted it almost hurts Kappa
[0:06:51] <%valriot> Yes
[0:07:02] <+BigNerdSam> fists are good
[0:07:03] <youngking_kush> Fists against human enemies is very broken lol
[0:07:05] <@MistyMntns> I just noticed that Pat has a new type face for the notifications and IDK if I like it.
[0:07:05] <+PMAvers> I was a fan of the axe in 2. Big hits and big armor.
[0:07:12] <%daemonazaezal> Glavie is just a bloodborne trick weapon, i love it
[0:07:16] <Anthrozzz> wanna say pat im a huge!
[0:07:20] <%Dakuu75> I felt like the combat in Nioh was good but, the enemy variety was so small. Was jsut a shit ton of the same oni and humans and I got bored and never finished it
[0:07:26] <+BigNerdSam> Samurai will never help you. Trust only your fists.
[0:07:29] <%IronOhki> @Anthrozzz Become Giant
[0:07:30] <$CrownlessKitty> i kept getting stuck on this game lol, can't do bossfights to save my life
[0:07:33] <%valriot> I would actually recommend Pat to go with Odachi and Katana just so Heart is his comfy damage stat, then bump health, stam and strength where needed
[0:07:35] <+zanz_san> I love that you get along far enough in Nioh 2 you can just change weapon modifiers
[0:07:37] <MidnightPacif1c> why not play the better one?
[0:07:42] <$Futurecity10> Nioh 1 is a 3/10, Nioh 2 is a 5/10
[0:07:48] <oda_flobunaga> Personal Fav weapon is the Shuten Doji Tetsubo
[0:07:49] <youngking_kush> @dakuu75 That's like the number 1 thing they addressed in Nioh 2
[0:08:01] <%RayReborne> @youngking_kush i went into the dlc of nioh 2 rocking fists and would stun and infinite combo most enemies, except the Snake ladies and Onis lol
[0:08:02] <%daemonazaezal> Id say there a bigger difficulty spike in nioh bosses than ds bosses
[0:08:05] <+BigNerdSam> Nioh is the best Dark Souls game since Diablo 2, change my mind
[0:08:08] <cartakus> I try to play all weapons in both games. It kinda turned into a problem when I returned to both rusty
[0:08:12] <Profmcstevie> Nioh 2 has so many different mobs and bosses to stomp your face with
[0:08:16] <%RayReborne> and my build was NOT strength based
[0:08:18] <BigFingerRo> OHSHITTIMEFORTHPASTARAT
[0:08:19] <artoflec> nioh has enough enemy types, it has too many missions lol
[0:08:37] <%valriot> Nioh IS basically Souls Diablo, which is the thing people don't get, it's BIG VIDEOGAME rules
[0:08:37] <President_valentine> I actually enjoy the combat in Nioh unlike souls games
[0:08:40] <$Futurecity10> Nioh 2's skill system is trash because you cant max out a weapons skills. Its genuine horse shit
[0:08:46] <+BigNerdSam> Nioh 2 is the Aria of Sorrow to Nioh 1's Symphony of the Night.
[0:08:47] <%IronOhki> @BigFingerRo Pa pas pats past Pasta-rat. (I like pasta, man)
[0:08:50] <Jaysky> Pat Rat
[0:08:58] <%Ziegsy> I struggled with nioh until I went full ninja build. then it became hilarious
[0:09:02] <%SWFanatic> PatSmellsAt

[0:12:52] <OneThousandTomatoes> you're going to start from where you left off?
[0:12:56] <%ErikFeral> you couldn't just look in the stat menu??
[0:12:57] <%BinaryFireball> maybe nioh just isnt good then?
[0:12:57] <ovan20> play Nioh 2 Kappa
[0:12:59] <cartakus> The beggining levels are the best though
[0:13:07] <%livlinn> oldgrayWave hai.
[0:13:08] <thatangryguyofde> Nioh aka Kunai with Chain bois
[0:13:08] <Blank9> nioh is amazing
[0:13:09] <+zanz_san> inventory
[0:13:11] <%Bluwizard21> that'll be next week
[0:13:12] <rectal_splash> no thats a sin cant skip
[0:13:14] <oda_flobunaga> What map are you on in Nioh 1?
[0:13:14] <%valriot> You can view Nioh 1 as a tutorial
[0:13:15] <+SiameseDuck> Nioh 1's great
[0:13:17] <%IronOhki> Hear that chat? It's on the Goblin list.
[0:13:22] <%SWFanatic> @shanna_become_gamer I said that Zangief looked more put together than Pat.
[0:13:27] <+rafaelba93> it somplicated af
[0:13:27] <%VioletHeart> Nioh 1's still a good game. It's worth one playthrough at least.
[0:13:28] <Profmcstevie> Play Nioh 1 so you can know it's full filth and appreciate Nioh 2
[0:13:30] <illtima> God, Pat looks like that tired Wojak meme
[0:13:34] <%afronooch> stat menu is like looking at hiergliyphics
[0:13:35] <%Dakuu75> Bro, the stats pages look like a FUCKING SPRED SHEET
[0:13:37] <+BigNerdSam> The game literally tells you what every stat does as you mouse over them
[0:13:38] <oda_flobunaga> like?
[0:13:39] <%ErikFeral> dang, nevermind. didn't know
[0:13:43] <%daemonazaezal> "Just read stats" says chat psaSmug
[0:13:43] <youngking_kush> Nioh 1 once, then 2
[0:13:44] <exas45> magic wildly improved my experience
[0:13:44] <%SharkMissile> That is fine
[0:13:44] <%RayReborne> All weapons use 3 difderent stats for scaling that dont matter till NG+
[0:13:45] <SunsetJack> Oh
[0:13:46] <oda_flobunaga> eeeeh
[0:13:46] <%tentavision> couldn't you kill both goblins if you played Nioh 2 and then Nioh 1?
[0:13:47] <%Treuan> Omn yo nuts?
[0:13:48] <%valriot> Omnyo is really flexible
[0:13:49] <%Bluwizard21> onymo is easy mode with that sloth talisman
[0:13:49] <+baedogg> if you cut the stupid diablo loot out of the nioh games they would be so far ahead of the souls games its not even funny
[0:13:52] <+zanz_san> magic is broken in Nioh
[0:13:55] <Blank9> the ultimate way to deal with goblins is do the menu option that automatically disassembles everything that's not purple rarity
[0:13:56] <%Agami23> theres two magic systems, omnyou and ninjutsu. both are strong
[0:13:57] <+SiameseDuck> Omnyo is scarily in-depth, it's great
[0:13:58] <%President_Miyazaki> You spend points on spells, and equip spells.
[0:13:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> to be fair magis is kind of a seperate build style I think
[0:14:05] <+PMAvers> Basically they're like buff items that refill when you use a shrine.
[0:14:05] <OthoZen> magic can really break this one
[0:14:09] <%Dakuu75> I only go for the ones that buff me
[0:14:10] <%PocketBearIllustrator> how are you finding obs and streamelements compared to streamlabs, Pat?
[0:14:11] <+DatAsuna> Nioh 2 dumbs magic down a lot
[0:14:11] <%VioletHeart> When in doubt just grab the one that buffs your weapon. It's like free fire paper in Dark Souls.
[0:14:12] <%AncelDeLambert> my poor cloud brain can't handle the amount of frontloaded reading a game like this has
[0:14:12] <@QueequegTheater> Just use weapon buffs
[0:14:12] <ovan20> you put points in magic and slot it in your shortcuts, it's literally that simple LUL
[0:14:12] <%ErikFeral> 300 spells vs 1 really good sword
[0:14:14] <+DatAsuna> But I dislike that
[0:14:14] <SunsetJack> Omnyo is useful in NG+ more.
[0:14:15] <youngking_kush> Ninjutsu > Onmyo
[0:14:17] <%Ziegsy> Sloth talisman = easy mode
[0:14:17] <%GhoulishCripple> it's really good tho pat
[0:14:17] <+zanz_san> they had to nerf the slow spell
[0:14:18] <%tanarath> nioh has many paths to the same destination
[0:14:20] <%Broand> I went mostly ninjustu and I enjoy it
[0:14:21] <shiny_prinny> it's a lot of reading
[0:14:21] <%SaiyanShoto> Sloth is the important one really
[0:14:29] <%Bt_Robot> Wait... this game has a Tokyo Ravens in it?
[0:14:29] <Blank9> nioh is monster hunter and souls having a baby
[0:14:32] <%Agami23> omnyou can render you unkillable to some bosses in nioh 2
[0:14:33] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Sloth Talisman, done
[0:14:36] <%AncelDeLambert> "mostly"
[0:14:37] <MyNameIsRasus> japasouls time
[0:14:37] <%SWFanatic> "It just works."
[0:14:37] <%Bluwizard21> get sloth talisman win game
[0:14:38] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Yeah I'm betting you're gonna drop this again cause this game sucks
[0:14:38] <youngking_kush> Sloth Talisman is broken in Nioh 1
[0:14:40] <+DatAsuna> The thing is because of how Nioh's debuffs work, you want at least 2 different elements
[0:14:42] <%valriot> Omnyo for you, will basically translate to 2-3 buffs/debuffs, and then "Element weapon buffs"
[0:14:42] <artoflec> i thought streamlabs obs was the same company this whole time too...
[0:14:45] <%Broand> I'm a fire bomb build
[0:14:57] <inutaihanyou123> don't worry Pat. it gets easier with time. 4k hours played and I can attest to you enjoying it
[0:14:57] <%Dakuu75> kinda nice that OBS is free... ussualy you'd have to pay for a competent service like it
[0:15:08] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> wtf paypal let me give Pat money
[0:15:10] <%AncelDeLambert> gotta be honest, the stance system in this game kills it pretty hard for me. It's too much to manage at once
[0:15:11] <+polothegreatest> Is destiny 2 a goblin game? Should i buy it?
[0:15:12] <%Bluwizard21> she's rubbing off on you
[0:15:13] <+DatAsuna> Kinda like Genshin, you wanna be combining elements all the time to crush the bosses
[0:15:13] <Cosairen> spear/sword was really fun
[0:15:13] <%PocketBearIllustrator> glad to hear it. I made the move back to regular obs myself.
[0:15:18] <%justcallmebobplease> This is going to be a good stream
[0:15:20] <@SoFarFetched> NO
[0:15:24] <@SoFarFetched> SAVE YOURSELF
[0:15:26] <%BoxNavy> never buy it
[0:15:27] <%IronOhki> I love Des2. Don't buy Des2.
[0:15:29] <scrambledxeggz> Yoooo!!! Good Morning!!!
[0:15:29] <%chance_h> Lol polo
[0:15:33] <@Ranryu692> Destiny 2 isn't a goblin game; it's a bad game
[0:15:34] <Profmcstevie> No buy Halo Infinite
[0:15:35] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:15:38] <%RayReborne> @futurecity10 man you really have it out for Nioh eh? Kappa
[0:15:39] <%afronooch> I love D2, dont buy d2
[0:15:41] <@QueequegTheater> Play Infinite instead
[0:15:41] <%valriot> I mean the content they deleted sucked, but sure
[0:15:41] <%Piemono> Mind Goblin: addicted to shitty game
[0:15:42] <Tracazoid> Can't have goblins if they've been erased
[0:15:42] <%ErikFeral> ow
[0:15:42] <+DatAsuna> Destiny 2 is just a loot game that really loves FOMO
[0:15:44] <%SWFanatic> Credit card? No problem
[0:15:44] <@MistyMntns> I need to get back into D2
[0:15:45] <%JoshManVGH> You shouldn't buy it because they are mean to their players.
[0:15:45] <+polothegreatest> Oh doodSad
[0:15:46] <Profmcstevie> also known as don't pay for Halo Infinite and play forever
[0:15:50] <%Treuan> Nothing will ever beat crucible, but man fuck Destiny 2
[0:15:50] <%RayReborne> nothing wrong with that bte
[0:15:53] <%debugdrawray_> litterally everything i ever paid for does not exist in game anymore
[0:15:55] <%RayReborne> btw*
[0:15:58] <+rafaelba93> got back into it to discover all my gear was useless
[0:16:00] <@SoFarFetched> @RayReborne nah thats just futurecity10 hot takes in general geefSmugAF
[0:16:01] <+SiameseDuck> FOMO to such an extreme that it erases its own FOMO after a while
[0:16:01] <%SWFanatic> psaBig psaDogchamp
[0:16:02] <@MistyMntns> They didnt delete it. They just went fuck you.
[0:16:03] <%ErikFeral> "For the puppies!!" - Destiny 2
[0:16:06] <%IronOhki> @DatAsuna Boy is the FOMO strong in that game.
[0:16:07] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Destiny peaked at the last D1 expansion, everything afterward was trash
[0:16:07] <youngking_kush> I will always contest Deztin6 has the best shooting tho
[0:16:07] <%Cozy90> I love it when my favorite weapon becomes unusable
[0:16:09] <%cvp5127> @PatStaresAt pat thoughts on rockstar backing down
[0:16:09] <%solracc25> psaGoblin deleted
[0:16:10] <%BoxNavy> ew what
[0:16:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> i wonder what bungie feels about halo now
[0:16:17] <%Bluwizard21> But Genshin Impact though?
[0:16:18] <+UltraViolet371> yeah if you want a loot game just get nioh 1 and 2, that shit's not going anywhere
[0:16:19] <%RayReborne> @sofarfetched ok lol Kappa
[0:16:20] <$Futurecity10> @RayReborne Yeah I dont like it 😲
[0:16:21] <%JoshManVGH> Masterful game making!
[0:16:21] <+A_Fistful_of_Bees> Can you define Mind Goblin and explain why they torment you so, Pat?
[0:16:22] <%tanarath> At least warframe doesn't delete your content, I guess.
[0:16:23] <%AncelDeLambert> when'd they back down?
[0:16:26] <+SiameseDuck> I kind of want to play Witch Queen but what's the point if it'll just get deleted in 3 years
[0:16:27] <%chance_h> Destiny 2 is just a worst halo
[0:16:27] <%baka_sugoi> Old trilagy is back
[0:16:31] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:16:31] <EynoStiles> yet, people defend destiny 2 religiously.
[0:16:32] <Profmcstevie> from?
[0:16:32] <%daemonazaezal> They just said whatever lol
[0:16:33] <+TaurusOxford> LUL
[0:16:33] <+zanz_san> Rockstar did nothing
[0:16:33] <+DatAsuna> They forced you to install games on their launcher
[0:16:39] <@SoFarFetched> @Futurecity10 you dont like a lot of  things,Ive seen you complain in here 90% of the time instead of enjoying things geefO
[0:16:40] <ovan20> true LUL
[0:16:42] <%daemonazaezal> and said buy the old ones
[0:16:43] <MyNameIsRasus> bunch of bitches
[0:16:43] <%RayReborne> HA what tools
[0:16:44] <Tracazoid> LUL Wow that's a shit move
[0:16:45] <Arina_Beam> Hey Pat your my favorite angry basketball.
[0:16:47] <%AncelDeLambert> just pirate Vice City and give them the finger
[0:16:48] <%BoxNavy> i hope they dont fix it
[0:16:49] <%baka_sugoi> LUL dang
[0:16:56] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Well, that's embarrassing.
[0:17:00] <Treasure_Vault> I wish Rockstar still released good games, like Red Dead Revolver
[0:17:01] <%SaiyanShoto> I think they meant they're putting the old games back on stores
[0:17:03] <+TaurusOxford> all according to plan
[0:17:04] <+Gamblor69> So this is Classic Coke
[0:17:04] <+JustToWatch> Never Back Down 3: The Anti-Backdown
[0:17:05] <+SiameseDuck> Ngl I keep forgetting R* has a launcher
[0:17:05] <Profmcstevie> Yo ho Yo ho
[0:17:06] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Everyone who bought the remastered version gets the old trilogy for free
[0:17:07] <%baka_sugoi> vidya gamz
[0:17:07] <MyNameIsRasus> it's always morally correct to pirate Rockstar Games
[0:17:08] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt What's on your shirt?
[0:17:08] <%drflatface> THAT'S A POWER PLAY
[0:17:13] <%AncelDeLambert> Take2 can eat all of the shit
[0:17:13] <%twistedj3ster> Backdown from making it better maybe?
[0:17:15] <thatangryguyofde> Rockstar sounds like a shit...or Nintendo
[0:17:17] <%daemonazaezal> ONLY ON ROCKSTAR  LAUNCHER
[0:17:18] <+DatAsuna> On ONE store
[0:17:19] <+polothegreatest> Nnever backdown the backdown
[0:17:21] <+BlackIronVengarl> BlackIronVengarl subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Nice harry du bois cosplay
[0:17:21] <%SaiyanShoto> Ohhhhh
[0:17:22] <Aydarkzero> hey pat just wondering why you find Nioh to have mind goblins?
[0:17:23] <%cvp5127> yohoho
[0:17:25] <%PocketBearIllustrator> why sue modders? because money?
[0:17:27] <$Futurecity10> @SoFarFetched Its easier to talk about something you hate instead of something you dislike.
[0:17:28] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> wow that's scum
[0:17:35] <%RayReborne> aka the rockstar launcher that SUCKS ASS
[0:17:35] <Tracazoid> Ahh, trying to pull an Origin. It didn't work there either.
[0:17:36] <+zanz_san> wwwooooowwwww
[0:17:37] <%SWFanatic> psaDogchamp psaGib
[0:17:39] <MyNameIsRasus> @BlackIronVengarl LUL
[0:17:46] <%SaiyanShoto> Welp I tried to give that guy the benefit of the doubt LUL
[0:17:48] <%justcallmebobplease> Yohohohoho-Yohohoho...
[0:17:48] <CH3F015> he's right it's on the linke website
[0:17:49] <knight_verse> Currently playing through Nioh 2 without having ever played Nioh 1... Yeah, the mindgoblins are real with this one, thankfully I looked up some information on how stats work (currently maining Sword/Odachi) and now I have just reached the first "Vergil" fight.
[0:17:49] <%Cozy90> psaDab
[0:17:51] <+TaurusOxford> @PocketBearIllustrator cause they do a better job than the remaster devs
[0:17:55] <Madinki> YO....HO......HO R)
[0:17:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah PC only and only through Rockstar Store
[0:17:58] <%king_wragles> @PocketBearIllustrator that's the closest we can think, cause like even then they're not going to get money
[0:17:59] <+KiwiRedgrave> sure am glad i didn't delete my ps4 san andreas game
[0:17:59] <Aydarkzero> the R* thing is weird
[0:18:04] <thicc_or_treat_> Thats a gangsta ass play. evil, but gangsta
[0:18:07] <%daemonazaezal> Why are we all just now surprised Rockstar is dog ass?
[0:18:09] <toulon_somberjade> Playing though Nioh 1 as wel
[0:18:11] <%RayReborne> @justcallmebobplease Yohohohoooo,yo ho ho hooooooo
[0:18:16] <%chance_h> Niohs mind goblins is the over abundance of choice and FOMO
[0:18:20] <%cvp5127> we'll allow you to give us your money
[0:18:21] <+Orcapugs> Unpopular opinion Live action Bebop is okay not a trash 🗑 fire 🔥. Definitely doesn’t size up to the original.
[0:18:23] <%solracc25> Gran Theft Videogame
[0:18:24] <+RahkshiLord> good thing i already own gta on steam and they can't take that away from me, gottem
[0:18:26] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @taurusoxford if that's true, Jesus Christ, that's a large amount of salt there.
[0:18:27] <%SaiyanShoto> No amount of patches is going to fix how bad the games look
[0:18:29] <@SoFarFetched> You last played this in 2017 Pat
[0:18:29] <youngking_kush> @futurecity10 Maybe to you lol, I tend to just ignore things I dont like. you should do the same
[0:18:31] <+DatAsuna> I need to go back and finish 2's side missions but it's so meh lol
[0:18:33] <Profmcstevie> Hopefully the save file will say what date
[0:18:34] <shinryu1331> hey pat glad you're playing nioh. I feel like nioh 1 and 2 dont get enough love
[0:18:35] <@SoFarFetched> so 4 years
[0:18:49] <%drflatface> will this be full lp?
[0:18:51] <+alphonseisbest> @orcapugs yea that's still Trash by comparison boi
[0:18:52] <@Ranryu692> that's a bad reason
[0:18:54] <%SWFanatic> "When you last played this I wasn't born yet!"
[0:18:55] <+alphonseisbest> IT IS
[0:18:58] <shinryu1331> nioh 2 shits all over nioh 1
[0:18:59] <+DatAsuna> Nioh 1 has a much better story, but that ain't saying much
[0:19:03] <@Ranryu692> and?
[0:19:03] <+alphonseisbest> Nioh 2 IS SOOO GOOD
[0:19:05] <+alphonseisbest> tup
[0:19:10] <ovan20> Nioh 1 have some cool stages, but Nioh 2 is better mechanically
[0:19:11] <%Broand> Which is its own mind goblin in a way
[0:19:12] <%tentavision> uh ooooh
[0:19:12] <%justcallmebobplease> C O R R E C T
[0:19:12] <+NickHatesSnow> yeeeeup same
[0:19:13] <SunsetJack> I heard a lot of stuff in Nioh 1 also got nerfed too like living weapon.
[0:19:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ahhh I getchu.
[0:19:14] <%Dakuu75> Chat, you know when you tell a streamer to do something, they specifically won't.
[0:19:14] <SmolBluGhost> sounds about right
[0:19:14] <Reisadan> That is correct
[0:19:16] <saddest_man> Nioh 2 improves literally everything
[0:19:16] <Profmcstevie> If you like Nioh 2 you will NEVER wanna go back to 1
[0:19:19] <$Futurecity10> There is literally no reason to play nioh 1 with 2
[0:19:20] <+zanz_san> Nioh 1 is good
[0:19:20] <shinryu1331> I love nioh 1 but nioh 2 Is just better by far
[0:19:21] <@Ranryu692> but you've played Nioh 1 and didn't like it muiltiple times
[0:19:22] <+SiameseDuck> 100% correct
[0:19:23] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> seriously Paypal, take my fucking donation
[0:19:25] <+DatAsuna> 2 streamlines omnyo too much for me and the bosses are a lot lamer
[0:19:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I understand completely.
[0:19:28] <$shanna_become_gamer> is that a goblin in itself?
[0:19:29] <Reisadan> Nioh 2 is THAT good.
[0:19:30] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> YOOOO We playing NIOH!? thats what im talking about, Ive got 200+ hours in this
[0:19:32] <@SoFarFetched> geefThink but I typed Pat stares at Nioh  into youtube and it gave me ONE video from 2017
[0:19:39] <youngking_kush> That's a fact
[0:19:40] <shinryu1331> also the story for nioh 1 feeds into nioh 2
[0:19:42] <Blank9> yeah it's your raidou 1 into raidou 2
[0:19:46] <+DatAsuna> @Futurecity10 Totally disagree. lol
[0:19:46] <%RayReborne> i went back to one after beating 2,and its not that bad of a transition. just a little off and missing a couple amazing mechanics
[0:19:48] <oda_flobunaga> Play 1 for the story, play 2 for the gameplay
[0:19:49] <+SiameseDuck> If you haven't played any Nioh, start with Nioh 1 then move onto 2 because you've got nowhere to go but up. Not that Nioh 1 is bad
[0:19:50] <%SWFanatic> Big Butts don't lie but sometimes the smaller patoot will become frightened by a fearsome rump.
[0:19:54] <Klarrann3> I did that with the witcher games, and boy those first ones are rough
[0:19:56] <%Dakuu75> they doubled DOWN
[0:19:57] <shinryu1331> I'd say they do a lot
[0:19:59] <illtima> Nioh 2 has even more buttons lol
[0:20:01] <%JoshManVGH> Layered ON TOP of
[0:20:02] <%valriot> Its not confusing, youre just not good at menu
[0:20:02] <+zanz_san> nnnnnooooo lol
[0:20:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> Loot management in Nioh 2 was a nightmare for me
[0:20:11] <%chance_h> There is no reason to play video games, just react to other streamers streams for money
[0:20:18] <%SaiyanShoto> Nah it's confusing
[0:20:18] <+DatAsuna> It is confusing, it just takes time.
[0:20:20] <%Dakuu75> it is confusing
[0:20:21] <toulon_somberjade> I'm guessing a lot of those mind goblins are the huge amount of consumables and the mission structure?
[0:20:22] <%valriot> Its literally just number go up
[0:20:25] <Sowlith> I just started Nioh 1 too recently, I'm confused as hell
[0:20:26] <%Djinnazz> It's as simple or as complicated as you want it to be.
[0:20:26] <+rafaelba93> ita VERY confusing
[0:20:26] <+zanz_san> I have four sets of hotkeys in Nioh 2
[0:20:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> many-u's
[0:20:26] <artoflec> im glad they doubled down, its a lot of systems, but none are very complicated
[0:20:26] <SunsetJack> It is confusing but takes a while to get use too.
[0:20:27] <%MoguManda> today chat is the goblins
[0:20:28] <%President_Miyazaki> It's really not
[0:20:28] <+UltraViolet371> the menus ARE confusing and there are MORE menus in 2
[0:20:28] <%Ziegsy> Oh yeah theres SO MANY MENUS
[0:20:29] <%JoshManVGH> Final Fantasy Origins, now THAT simplifies a bunch of Niohs shit.
[0:20:30] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> I would agree with Pat on this one
[0:20:32] <%tanarath> Nioh 2 has even more stuff, but it also has better systems.
[0:20:32] <%cvp5127> use a guide
[0:20:33] <Profmcstevie> This is a numbers ass action game
[0:20:35] <+DatAsuna> By the time you get to the third region or so you'll have it figured out
[0:20:38] <shinryu1331> the confusing things can be ignored in early game
[0:20:39] <%afronooch> LUL
[0:20:39] <+KiwiRedgrave> i still need to continue the nioh 1 playthrough i tried to start from a few months ago
[0:20:41] <OneThousandTomatoes> can you even get gud at menus?
[0:20:41] <@QueequegTheater> There are barely more menus than Souls games
[0:20:41] <+SiameseDuck> I 100% NIoh 1 and 2, what do you mean Nioh's menus aren't confusing it's super confusing lmao
[0:20:42] <%RayReborne> it took me a while to understand some of the numbers meanings but its Possible
[0:20:43] <shiny_prinny> as someone with 300+ hours, no, it is confusing
[0:20:44] <+truelifedood300> Whats a mind goblin
[0:20:44] <youngking_kush> @reallybigrocks If you go in the settings you can make it so that you dont pick up a certain rarities of loot anymore. A godsend
[0:20:45] <%raggedwharfrat> NUMBER GO UP PAT
[0:20:45] <WzillNJ> bro the gear has like 6 different systems going on
[0:20:47] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt It's number go up if you braindead play the game
[0:20:47] <President_valentine> It is unless you're NG+
[0:20:51] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Nioh is *incredibly* numerically dense, you're crazy
[0:20:51] <@QueequegTheater> BUT NUMBER GO UP THO
[0:20:52] <+DatAsuna> Nioh 2 has worse menus and way too many sphere grids
[0:20:52] <%tentavision> IF HE'S CONFUSED, THEN IT HAS CONFUSED HIM, ERGO
[0:20:52] <+zanz_san> Yep
[0:20:54] <@SoFarFetched> if 90% of the chat is saying its confusing and psa1guy is saying its not,they might be crazy Kappa
[0:20:55] <%Dakuu75> Play it without a fucking guide and tell me it's not complicated
[0:20:55] <shinryu1331> that's what I love about nioh though
[0:20:57] <+fetrigon> buh number go up
[0:20:57] <%valriot> Pat, you know i have like 1000 hours across all these games, its super not complicated
[0:20:57] <%President_Miyazaki> Which you can completely ignore on first playthrough
[0:20:59] <%SWFanatic> Uh oh, dead gobobolin walkin
[0:21:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> @youngking_kush :O
[0:21:01] <incredibleCrayon> I love buttons
[0:21:01] <%tanarath> Doesn't Nioh 2 have respecs as well?
[0:21:01] <OthoZen> DO combo
[0:21:01] <%tank7013> Also there's like 40 different numbers
[0:21:02] <artoflec> i dunno its like Dante's stances, the inputs are the same
[0:21:02] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Im here Pat if youve got questions, ill try to give you good answers
[0:21:03] <%AncelDeLambert> stances and ripostes and charges and meters and AAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
[0:21:04] <ovan20> @PatStaresAt just imagine it's god hand on crack LUL
[0:21:05] <MyNameIsRasus> You're not good at menus to mr attache case himself
[0:21:05] <oda_flobunaga> that's wrong Pat
[0:21:06] <theshillman> bro it's literally just God Hand
[0:21:07] <+SiameseDuck> I love how confusing it is
[0:21:07] <+BigNerdSam> Pat, that system is just the skill system from God Hand but with more buttons.
[0:21:08] <%SaiyanShoto> I've had to restart a few times because if I don't play for a couple of days I don't know how everything works anymore
[0:21:08] <+Orcapugs> As someone who plays 14 that seems weird Pat
[0:21:09] <+fetrigon> pat wrong again TPFufun
[0:21:09] <shinryu1331> check out poorer llamas vods on nioh 2
[0:21:10] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I've been playing SMT5 lately, which is like... the Nioh of JRPGs. :P
[0:21:10] <%barrakuta371> oh boy chat in force with the globlins
[0:21:13] <%KnightOfTrousers> In playing Souls-Likes I only concern myself with big jumps in power, where numbers are concerned
[0:21:15] <choocheess> this is Nioh not Age of Empires
[0:21:15] <%valriot> LUL
[0:21:15] <+DatAsuna> When nioh 2 started putting sphere grids within sphere grids I really lost patience
[0:21:15] <thatangryguyofde> this sounds like Pat when being told about mechanics in anime fighters LUL
[0:21:19] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Literally just use high stance, it's always higher damage
[0:21:20] <%Nordguy> just put whatever feels good lmao
[0:21:21] <Sowlith> I had to look up multiple guides to learn how to play this game
[0:21:25] <+RyTYoung> yeyeye nioh 1 is the shit
[0:21:27] <+EmptyPenguin> "I'm used to it so it's not confusing:
[0:21:28] <+TaurusOxford> oof
[0:21:29] <HoboFlea> love nioh, most confusing game I've ever played
[0:21:29] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Pat to be fair when I first played the game I completely skipped the Skill menu and beat the game.
[0:21:29] <+EmptyPenguin> "
[0:21:33] <%KnightOfTrousers> Souls-like are far more about skilled play than big number
[0:21:36] <%valriot> Just hit the buttons LUL
[0:21:37] <Blank9> nioh is absolutely like trying to jump into pre-tri monster hunter
[0:21:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:21:39] <%Dakuu75> ...
[0:21:40] <+polothegreatest> doodBait doodShake doodNuts
[0:21:41] <+rafaelba93> lol
[0:21:41] <ovan20> LUL
[0:21:43] <+TaurusOxford> LMFAO
[0:21:44] <%chance_h> Pls don’t murder him
[0:21:45] <%afronooch> LUL
[0:21:46] <%Agami23> @truelifedood300 a personified version of things that trigger pats OCD bad.
[0:21:46] <saddest_man> nioh 2 get another layer of complexity with soul cores
[0:21:47] <%MoguManda> XD
[0:21:48] <MidnightPacif1c> LUL
[0:21:49] <choocheess> LUL
[0:21:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> It all clicks around hour 238
[0:21:49] <$Futurecity10> never unlocked back stab lol
[0:21:50] <%RayReborne> "ive spent a million hours therefore its easy to understand" Kappa
[0:21:50] <%Dakuu75> "Nothing is complicated whedn you KNOW stuff"
[0:21:51] <Tracazoid> LUL EV training and IV training is simple guys- A Pokemon fan
[0:21:52] <+zanz_san> I have 4 sets of hot keys in Nioh 2 it can be pretty complicated
[0:21:52] <%Criotos> I managed to ignore that for 90% of the game. Played a spear build and used  medium attack twice then dashed out and made most of it easy
[0:21:53] <%tentavision> irrelevant
[0:22:03] <LVL1_Scumbag> Just read
[0:22:04] <+DatAsuna> One thing that REALLY doesn't help with either nioh compared to souls is that their fextralife sites are gabrage
[0:22:04] <Cosairen> i played the game once and didnt find it that hard to understand :)
[0:22:07] <%tentavision> your memory has been diluted
[0:22:07] <SunsetJack> High stance suck for some weapons...
[0:22:09] <choocheess> breathing is so easy said the man to the fish
[0:22:10] <Profmcstevie> You are the LAST person to speak of it's experience as a beginner, 1000 hours ago
[0:22:11] <%baka_sugoi> psaGoblin
[0:22:12] <incredibleCrayon> Shit I am confused right now
[0:22:14] <%Dakuu75> moving on~
[0:22:14] <$Jaxnos> "flying a plane is easy, i have 1000s of hours so i would know"
[0:22:16] <shinryu1331> the hardest thing to understand was the crafting system
[0:22:16] <%valriot> No, for real though, its not as hard as it looks
[0:22:17] <+DatAsuna> All the good nioh advice online is hidden away in unstickied reddit posts
[0:22:18] <ovan20> Pat Nioh is like Path of Exile, it's super simple Kappa
[0:22:19] <%Pappajimbo> i have 1000 hours. do you like it? -nah
[0:22:19] <$Solid_Stro> sabert14Smug
[0:22:21] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> @Criotos this man knows deh wey
[0:22:23] <%MoguManda> number go up...
[0:22:25] <%cvp5127> just get the kusarigama and spin to win
[0:22:25] <+baedogg> Pat, I've performed over 500 brain surgeries, they really aren't THAT hard
[0:22:26] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> the problem is Nioh has SO MANY systems that even if they are straightforward on their own there's just so much to take in
[0:22:27] <+VincentBrouillons> high stance dodge is way worse
[0:22:31] <Sowlith> surrounded by trolls AND goblins
[0:22:32] <theshillman> real goblin town in here
[0:22:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> Tbf I didn't pay much attention to the skills and stats and I just hit guy
[0:22:36] <%IronOhki> "I figured it out, why can't you!" must be one of the classic argument fallacies.
[0:22:48] <%AncelDeLambert> it looking difficult makes your brain go "no"
[0:22:51] <shiny_prinny> Exactly
[0:22:51] <shinryu1331> the skill tree is way better in nioh 2
[0:22:59] <+DatAsuna> The onmyo screen has less content but is MORE confusing in 2
[0:23:00] <Profmcstevie> It may not be as hard as it LOOKS but LOOKING complicated when it isn't is bad design
[0:23:00] <%AncelDeLambert> "my copy works fine"
[0:23:00] <+RyTYoung> You don't need to worry about that sruff
[0:23:02] <shinryu1331> they improve that in nioh 2
[0:23:03] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> dont need em, buy the passives
[0:23:04] <%zeroarturia> it
[0:23:13] <SunsetJack> That's fine. I didn't learn Omnyo until NG+.
[0:23:15] <%Nordguy> @patstaresat sickle & chains is very powerful
[0:23:15] <%AncelDeLambert> "I haven't seen that bug"
[0:23:16] <%MoguManda> yeah same
[0:23:18] <+DatAsuna> They do NOT improve it in 2 lmao
[0:23:21] <President_valentine> they don't learn magic
[0:23:25] <$grotto_kein> 89%  of the numbers dont matter till new game ++  but yeah lot to take in
[0:23:27] <+VincentBrouillons> spells are pretty straightforward in 2
[0:23:29] <soflicar> just grab sloth talisman
[0:23:32] <%IronOhki> That was a good stream
[0:23:33] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt just look for Sloth talisman on that screen, unlock it and do nothing else for Onmyo.
[0:23:34] <+BigNerdSam> @PatStaresAt When you say "the onmyo screen" do you mean the screen you buy Onmyo spells in or the screen where you allocate attunement to spells?
[0:23:34] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> It would help if the UI wasn't designed the way it is.
[0:23:37] <theshillman> ! Pat At Risk !
[0:23:42] <Blank9> I just laser focused on 1 or 2 spells and only used them
[0:23:44] <Profmcstevie> The first Dishonoured hit hard, but then you chilled out
[0:23:46] <+KiwiRedgrave> nioh 1 is super fun but suuuuper long and I too want to beat it before i play 2
[0:23:49] <youngking_kush> They definitely improved the UI a lot in 2
[0:23:50] <zzNamttamzz> Celeste caused some distress at first
[0:23:51] <shinryu1331> think of it as ff14 old school cross classes
[0:23:52] <%zeroarturia> there is a lot of systems to remember, it CAN BE complicated
[0:23:55] <marcomatame> pat you look pretty harrycore rn
[0:23:56] <StrangeCoincidence> Despair will never die!
[0:23:59] <toulon_somberjade> Think of it: he chose not to use the most broken things in Nioh due to how confusing the wording in the screens is
[0:23:59] <%blastyoboots> good!
[0:24:01] <%justcallmebobplease> THIS IS WHAT WE ARE HERE FOR
[0:24:04] <+zanz_san> sorry
[0:24:06] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Everyone has that one game they think is super easy that noone understands why you think it's easy
[0:24:06] <%SWFanatic> Uh oh Gobobolin winning
[0:24:08] <+RyTYoung> I wish I could play Dishonored at 60 on my ps5
[0:24:12] <%IronOhki> We got you, Pat. Fight the Goblins.
[0:24:12] <shinryu1331> yeah same
[0:24:12] <%PocketBearIllustrator> what did I do?
[0:24:13] <didgereedoodah> lol
[0:24:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> Chat definitely isn't helping LUL
[0:24:14] <%Dakuu75> THAT'S HOW I ALWAYS UPGRADED MY GEAR
[0:24:15] <%valriot> Yeah thats actually good
[0:24:18] <%RayReborne> omg what
[0:24:19] <%MoguManda> that's some advanced shit
[0:24:19] <+EmptyPenguin> viable strat
[0:24:20] <+zanz_san> Totally
[0:24:21] <+fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:24:21] <%chance_h> Hoes mad
[0:24:23] <%SWFanatic> psaGoblin VS psaLiz FIGHT
[0:24:23] <shinryu1331> that can get you by until you learn more
[0:24:23] <+SiameseDuck> That's the Nioh experience ngl
[0:24:24] <%AncelDeLambert> oh fuck I FORGOT this game had RNG gear!
[0:24:24] <shiny_prinny> it's good tech
[0:24:24] <%za7az> that's a solid way to do it
[0:24:25] <ovan20> that's weird
[0:24:26] <+JustToWatch> oh you still want to do that
[0:24:27] <+zanz_san> that works
[0:24:28] <Blank9> that's how you do it
[0:24:28] <%justcallmebobplease> Roh roh, fight the goblin!
[0:24:29] <%RayReborne> ive never thought about doing that lmao
[0:24:29] <%valriot> Thats genuinely a good idea
[0:24:30] <%BinaryFireball> so is nioh that much worse than DS ?
[0:24:32] <ShineTheDiamond> It's ok, Pat.
[0:24:33] <%AncelDeLambert> FUCK I hate dungeon crawler drops!
[0:24:33] <SunsetJack> That's fine.
[0:24:34] <tengel66> hi pat!
[0:24:34] <%SharkMissile> I've played dozens of hours fo both NIOH's, and I SUPER agree with Pat
[0:24:37] <oda_flobunaga> Solid
[0:24:37] <%SharkMissile> Shit is so confusing
[0:24:39] <President_valentine> Exactly
[0:24:39] <%BinaryFireball> for mind goblins
[0:24:40] <$grotto_kein> The big spell to get is oracle, turns mini map into a radar
[0:24:40] <%IronOhki> @justcallmebobplease I love this.
[0:24:41] <didgereedoodah> that actually works pretty well in the beginning
[0:24:49] <themountaindwarf> wow bebop is shit
[0:24:50] <+DatAsuna> That's too broad of a question
[0:24:51] <Blank9> treat the game like it's Low Rank Monster Hunter, armor and weapons are just as you come by it
[0:24:51] <youngking_kush> You gotta read Pat
[0:24:55] <aln1yat> so is this mind goblin just going back to a save from months ago?
[0:24:55] <$Jaxnos> this is gonna be some strong mechanical blindness, huh? or re-blindness i guess
[0:24:56] <+KiwiRedgrave> like the stance system
[0:24:58] <shinryu1331> I love nioh and I think DS looks boring to me
[0:24:58] <themountaindwarf> one piece live action soon tm
[0:25:00] <%valriot> Nioh is more like Diablo, its build crafting is super above Souls
[0:25:01] <shiny_prinny> it's just waaaay daunting in its complexity
[0:25:04] <%Dakuu75> the combat in Nioh is actually really good but... the game has down sides
[0:25:05] <+DatAsuna> I like the stage system because it means I don't have to run a whole NG+ to replay stuff
[0:25:05] <%SaiyanShoto> I get tired of looking at the same armor after a few missions so I like picking up a bunch of different armor
[0:25:07] <%BinaryFireball> thats insane
[0:25:09] <%AncelDeLambert> "here, take this kitchen sink"
[0:25:10] <Profmcstevie> Nioh is made by ACTION GAME developers so I expect as much
[0:25:10] <+RyTYoung> I wish I didn't have a gear rarity system
[0:25:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Where's the wetness meter
[0:25:14] <+SiameseDuck> It literally does
[0:25:14] <SunsetJack> You don't really use the extra mechanics lol
[0:25:15] <shinryu1331> some things could be trimmed down in nioh like the titles and stuff
[0:25:16] <+uncyderf> no fishing, you lie!
[0:25:19] <%SWFanatic> Bork says Zangief
[0:25:19] <+Orcapugs> FightinCowboy is an excellent Nioh source. Check him out
[0:25:19] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype all of em
[0:25:20] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt what about the ZAPPING SYSTEM
[0:25:24] <ovan20> there's no survival mechanics tho Kappa
[0:25:24] <%justcallmebobplease> Believe in the chat, that believes in you, Pat - you can push through and have a blast!
[0:25:25] <$Futurecity10> I've beaten Nioh 1 once, I've beaten Dark souls 1 30 times
[0:25:26] <+DatAsuna> Like If I wanna fight lady maria or gehrman again i can just go fuck myself
[0:25:27] <%BlackIronVengarl> I hope nioh 3 has a farming and fishing minigame
[0:25:29] <%tanarath> it has three zapping system?
[0:25:29] <Sowlith> So far in my playthrough, I pretty much never just stances
[0:25:31] <@QueequegTheater> Does it have a morality system tho nagHmm
[0:25:32] <scrumbotime> In 2 I managed to make some fucked up kusarigama mega wizard ninja, and that involved learning all three systems which was rough
[0:25:32] <%RayReborne> some of the Weapon skills are either weak or really situational
[0:25:33] <shinryu1331> no zap
[0:25:33] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> A gun
[0:25:33] <youngking_kush> Alot of stuff you dont need on base NG
[0:25:33] <%SharkMissile> It's a Strand type game
[0:25:34] <ethey16> @patstaresat have you played mortal shell?
[0:25:35] <What_Up_Duck> It feels like one of those mission-based PSP games blown up to a console form.
[0:25:38] <SunsetJack> I didn't use ky pulse as often in Nioh difficulty lol
[0:25:40] <%SaiyanShoto> Nice purple hoodie Pat
[0:25:43] <Dlent_> KomodoHype every mechanic
[0:25:44] <+Count_Graagh> Does it have transfarring?
[0:25:45] <%SWFanatic> Why does Zangief prefer Paige to Pat?
[0:25:47] <+KiwiRedgrave> weapon stances
[0:25:47] <MyNameIsRasus> But it's Zipangu System, because it's in Japan
[0:25:48] <oda_flobunaga> There is a weapon in 2 with a inbuilt style meter
[0:25:48] <owazowski> So when do you do the nioh sex??
[0:25:48] <+SilverDevilfish> Nioh also has great things like: ATTACK bonuses show up on your weapon damage. DAMAGE bonuses do not.
[0:25:50] <%valriot> Change stance
[0:25:50] <+Risingxiv> Nioh stage system is the same as Monster hunter's mission system
[0:25:50] <Sowlith> my bad, *use stances
[0:25:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> adjust?
[0:25:52] <%RayReborne> never Change maybe?
[0:25:52] <retrosadness> i was gonna say "does it have pokemon?" but then i remembered it literally does
[0:25:53] <%Dakuu75> sometimes when Pat calls for Gief, I end up yelling "ZangiEEEEEEEF" in my own house
[0:25:55] <$Futurecity10> He's saying he never uses the other 2 stances
[0:25:55] <%Piemono> high low middle
[0:25:59] <+DatAsuna> It means they just ignored the system
[0:25:59] <%tentavision> adjusy
[0:26:07] <Vakojin> Nioh plays more like a fighting game than anything.
[0:26:07] <@QueequegTheater> Just use high stance on all weapons
[0:26:08] <%SharkMissile> Uhhhh....
[0:26:09] <+DatAsuna> They have that too though
[0:26:11] <%SharkMissile> Who wants to tell him
[0:26:11] <%Ziegsy> High stance all the way bby
[0:26:13] <@Jekado> Or a Just Defend from Garou
[0:26:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> @tentavision Adjussy
[0:26:14] <+SiameseDuck> No it has that too
[0:26:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> NEVER use stances? that's actually crazy
[0:26:18] <$Jaxnos> Just Stance 2021 has the best selection of songs
[0:26:18] <Profmcstevie> hit em with the Just Dance Stance
[0:26:20] <$CrownlessKitty> thats a thing too
[0:26:20] <%baka_sugoi> B R A I N csbeastSetIn
[0:26:20] <%RayReborne> dude Low stance is almost needed with the Sword against the Crawling zombies
[0:26:20] <%GhoulishCripple> that IS also a thing @patstaresat
[0:26:22] <%MugenSandan> Oh this gonna be a GOOD GOBLIN STREAM psaGoblin
[0:26:23] <+BigNerdSam> That does kind of exist
[0:26:23] <+VincentBrouillons> High Stance fucking sucks
[0:26:26] <Jontman42> I switch stance between every attack pretty much
[0:26:26] <shinryu1331> yeah ki pulse and stance change at the same time
[0:26:26] <%BinaryFireball> you got this lets gooooo.... and he walks away lol
[0:26:27] <+DatAsuna> God I hate the high and low stance gauntlet animations in 2
[0:26:29] <%RayReborne> it helps at least
[0:26:30] <%SaiyanShoto> I just use high stance on everything
[0:26:31] <%Ziegsy> @queequegtheater YEAH! s person of CULTURE
[0:26:32] <$grotto_kein> That s a thing too
[0:26:33] <%valriot> To be fair, Nioh 2 is so much more concise idk how much is different in 1 now lmao
[0:26:33] <SunsetJack> @queequegtheater No. High Stance sword isn't great dood.
[0:26:33] <didgereedoodah> that's flux
[0:26:34] <Blank9> high stance for POWER mid stance for crowd control, low stance for nothing
[0:26:36] <shiny_prinny> Flux is a thing
[0:26:36] <Sowlith> I use like mid stance and that's it
[0:26:38] <oda_flobunaga> Kusarigussy
[0:26:40] <%YakumoYomi> I mean...changing stances at a certain time IS a thing
[0:26:40] <youngking_kush> If yall don't use Stances I see why it's so difficult lol
[0:26:41] <+A_Fistful_of_Bees> Behold Pat's butt cushion. EXPOSED!
[0:26:42] <%GhoulishCripple> also stance chnage Ki pulse is super good
[0:26:43] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> I can totally get the "stick to one stance" mentality, though
[0:26:46] <SaltyAzteca> So whats the mind goblin with Nioh?
[0:26:47] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> fuck the stance system
[0:26:48] <%PocketBearIllustrator> please let it be coffee and not Monster.
[0:26:49] <%rkbinder> stop procrastinating Pat
[0:26:51] <shinryu1331> low stance has fast dodging and pokes
[0:26:51] <thatangryguyofde> the mind goblins will return by the 3rd boss LUL
[0:26:53] <lehvak182> @patstaresat Is SMT V the NiOh of Persona games?
[0:26:53] <Hamborgini> low stance odachi gang represent
[0:26:54] <robert_orri> use stance at the peak Ki counter timing to Ki counter I think is what that dude was talking about @PatStaresAt
[0:26:55] <%MoguManda> low stance does the spinz
[0:26:58] <@QueequegTheater> @SunsetJack Why the fuck would I use a boring sword when switchglaives exist
[0:26:59] <%RyTYoung> RyTYoung subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[0:27:02] <@SoFarFetched> @SaltyAzteca (Dont Restart Fresh)
[0:27:05] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:27:08] <What_Up_Duck> Let's get in there and cry
[0:27:09] <%IronOhki> What's wrong Pat
[0:27:09] <President_valentine> It Nioh 2 I mainly used fist in high stance and everything else switching between mid and high
[0:27:10] <@SoFarFetched> no one reads the stream titles
[0:27:13] <%RayReborne> high stance with SPEARS can be great with a couple attacks and then switch off it
[0:27:13] <@SoFarFetched> geefPlz
[0:27:14] <Jontman42> you learn to swirch stances constantly
[0:27:15] <+DatAsuna> I super disagree that 2 is more simple, I think if pat went straight to 2 without learning these systems in 1, he'd have a harder time learning.
[0:27:17] <%chance_h> The caffeine will help energize those goblins
[0:27:25] <didgereedoodah> I just used midstance until I was more comfortable
[0:27:25] <ape_hawk> idunno, whats the mind goblin with you?

[0:29:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> People think mechanics are scammers because they don't know shit about their cars
[0:29:20] <SunsetJack> @queequegtheater Sword mystic ability for back damage increase and dragon set is dumb.

[0:30:02] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I'm so happy I don't drive. owning a car just sounds really expensive.
[0:30:03] <%chance_h> My mechanic told me my truck has ligma
[0:30:06] <toulon_somberjade> God help you if you need to replace a Lincoln Air brake system. The goddamn thing often costs more then the fucking value of the car it's in

[0:46:03] <+MisterAvry> "Dirty deeds that are done with sheep"
[0:46:06] <%IronOhki> I can absolutely hear how you'd hear Thunder Chief.

[0:46:55] <%Cozy90> I always wondered why the thunder chief had so many dirty deeds
[0:46:56] <oda_flobunaga> But Bussin Whussy is even better
[0:46:56] <%doomunderthestairs> @PatStaresAt thoughts on Ultra instinct shaggy in Multiversus?

[0:47:41] <CyborgAV> We totally did, Pat

[0:47:45] <Jaysky> Literally years without any mention ofn E7 and today I hear it like 4 times, wtf is going on?
[0:47:45] <MiamiMemory> Eureka was the friends we made along the way.
[0:47:46] <+SaphronBlackbourne> @SharkMissile Stormblood relic weapon grind place
[0:47:48] <Profmcstevie> They found it NOW sure

[0:47:51] <+alphonseisbest> Not for BLu
[0:47:52] <Cosairen> you just run nm trains
[0:48:00] <+alphonseisbest> has the Best BLU BIS
[0:48:01] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Well, I'm going to sleep myself. take it easy, Pat n chat.
[0:48:04] <$IzazaOzihaha> I love how mentioning Eureka just spawns a discussion on Eureka Seven and its kickass tracks.
[0:48:05] <+alphonseisbest> its is tho
[0:48:05] <%RayReborne> @bigfingerro fr fr
[0:48:06] <@QueequegTheater> But that armor tho Kreygasm
[0:48:06] <+MosesUnspoken> I got that armor tho. it's sweet.
[0:48:06] <%WhereIsWill> but the mount tho!
[0:48:09] <+MisterAvry> 'member Eureka's Castle?
[0:48:10] <+alphonseisbest> on the discord
[0:48:14] <%VioletHeart> BA's actually super easy but getting into a run  is a headache.
[0:48:15] <+SiameseDuck> The armor sets are cool for glams
[0:48:18] <%SWFanatic> @PocketBearIllustrator goodnight
[0:48:19] <+alphonseisbest> the Armours dope too
[0:48:22] <%FingaLights> When I hear Eureka, I just think of that one SyFy show
[0:48:24] <PunishedVenomWolf> is it even still possible to get the weapons from eureka i got stuck in pagos
[0:48:25] <@QueequegTheater> BA is easy tho?
[0:48:33] <+alphonseisbest> Big easy with the discord help
[0:48:37] <Cosairen> BA discord has that shit down to a science now
[0:48:38] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @swfanatic night!
[0:48:39] <+Kyma1020> It got easier
[0:48:40] <Jontman42> bussin bussy
[0:48:43] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> I just want Pat to get to my donation before he dies horribly from sleep deprivation
[0:48:43] <LoreKeeper_Thal> there's a discord to setup BA runs
[0:48:44] <$shanna_become_gamer> oh wow, Eureka's castle
[0:48:44] <dredgyboi> BA is completely solved
[0:48:44] <+princearthura> Echo boost to BA makes it easy now
[0:48:47] <+alphonseisbest> I got the mount in 1 GO
[0:48:49] <Jaysky> Ok is this Final Fantasy stuff?
[0:48:49] <Psyramics> my DC has a discord server that will run you through that shit
[0:48:55] <@QueequegTheater> Yes, you live in Canada
[0:48:58] <+Kyma1020> due to people coming together and grouping up for B.A
[0:48:58] <%SirGO0SE> bussin ass

[0:48:59] <%studleydoorite> jerking each other off sounds pretty dope
[0:49:00] <vnzuelandude> full playrhrough les go
[0:49:03] <Profmcstevie> SCIENTISTS of FF14 solved it
[0:49:03] <%VioletHeart> It's easy, it's just punishing if you die because of no raises. The actual mechanics are like... easier than most dungeon bosses though.
[0:49:07] <Jontman42> buss my bussin boy bussy
[0:49:08] <%afronooch> Primal Forays is a Eureka discord for BA runs
[0:49:08] <@QueequegTheater> Just don't be shitters
[0:49:08] <dredgyboi> nah i did BA like 5 times
[0:49:09] <KaironFortressKnight> Is that English?
[0:49:10] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> it used to be that way, i can confirm
[0:49:17] <+alphonseisbest> @princearthura no, BA didnt have Echo boost iirc

[0:50:33] <%RayReborne> But he's tall and has a hoodie Pat
[0:50:34] <%BinaryFireball> you should do it once though
[0:50:34] <BigYanno> I think the implication is you should tank your viewership by becoming a FFXIV streamer
[0:50:34] <Sowlith> when you are supposed to sleep replace with raids, obviously
[0:50:34] <%MelBrooksKA> Have you tried not sleeping? @PatStaresAt
[0:50:35] <$Solid_Stro> sabert14Smug
[0:50:35] <%BinaryFireball> just once
[0:50:35] <RyuuAoi> @studleydoorite That our Pat for ya!
[0:50:36] <Brandon__Brando> tank your channel and just play ff14
[0:50:38] <Profmcstevie> If you setup a routine "raiding on Fridays" or something I'd be down to watch

[0:50:44] <%spitelite> prove it
[0:50:45] <+alphonseisbest> I would watch u do Ultimate fights
[0:50:49] <CyborgAV> I used to raid mornings, it was pretty chill
[0:50:50] <BigFingerRo> BE A NORMAL HUMAN AND USE MORNINGS
[0:50:51] <%WhereIsWill> savage starts at 5AM pat
[0:50:52] <amiavamp> Hire someone else to swap out with you like it's classic WoW LUL
[0:50:53] <@SoFarFetched> @Brandon__Brando hes already doing that with endwalker when it comes out Kappa
[0:50:53] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Savage/Ultimate prog is fucking CANCER for streaming as well
[0:50:58] <%notsoy> progression raiding absolutely does not sound like good streaming
[0:51:00] <cartakus> We like misery
[0:51:02] <%barrakuta371> mornings suck
[0:51:05] <+DatAsuna> just stream SMTV while you're at it
[0:51:08] <Anthrozzz> why does this  seem prerecored?
[0:51:09] <%notsoy> from my recollection of progression raiding
[0:51:09] <%studleydoorite> @RyuuAoi no 48 hours is a bit much for our pat, in his advanced age
[0:51:10] <%Bt_Robot> Who would watch you being quiet for three hours?
[0:51:16] <thelonechris> Also Pat looks especially cracked out today
[0:51:18] <%baka_sugoi> Baby rage PAT
[0:51:21] <%SWFanatic> Tantrum = Content

[0:51:27] <BigFingerRo> What about doing picture in picture?
[0:51:29] <%studleydoorite> can you teach me to do that?
[0:51:29] <MiamiMemory> New morning show called "Pat And Friends"
[0:51:29] <%Agami23> are they miserable? i watch ultimate prog and stuff alot

[0:51:32] <%FingaLights> Baby Vtube Pat when??
[0:51:33] <%RayReborne> Pat wants his gamer words in private Kappa
[0:51:34] <BigYanno> can you tell the future to get some sleep
[0:51:37] <azure_dunes> pat learned how to actually use crazy talk
[0:51:37] <+polothegreatest> Ah xbox360 experience LUL
[0:51:38] <+alphonseisbest> Crazy talk is POWERFUL like that
[0:51:41] <$shanna_become_gamer> life = content
[0:51:41] <%tank7013> Damn, Crazy Talk has strengthened
[0:51:42] <%BinaryFireball> serious business
[0:51:45] <%IronOhki> Pat can tell the future. I just heard on old Podcasts when he completely predicted the Switch.
[0:51:47] <%SWFanatic> @SWFanatic You're a wesley snipes.
[0:51:51] <RyuuAoi> @studleydoorite Ah yes right. Pat is older now
[0:51:53] <@Ranryu692> yyup
[0:51:53] <+alphonseisbest> I would Watch that
[0:51:53] <oda_flobunaga> Team up with Woolie and get him to ban you by talking about future story shit @PatStaresAt
[0:51:55] <Profmcstevie> It's serious fucking BUSINESS
[0:51:58] <+Peterbyte_> has he launched the game yet?
[0:51:59] <Cosairen> what nah you can joke around all the time in raid
[0:52:00] <EynoStiles> do it for the views
[0:52:00] <%Bt_Robot> @RayReborne Everyone knows his Vtuber model is the Pasta Rat
[0:52:01] <%RayReborne> callouts, silence and Keyboard noises. keyboards everywhere
[0:52:02] <%BinaryFireball> sounds like mmo pvp, didnt know raids get crazy too
[0:52:02] <%Agami23> it sucks since savage raids have the best music
[0:52:09] <+lucaflowe> People acting like savage raiding is all fun and games
[0:52:09] <%FingaLights> I wouldn't watch it
[0:52:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> there are some streamers who can do it, but not many
[0:52:17] <Brandon__Brando> I would watch one stream of it
[0:52:18] <+alphonseisbest> Ultimate fights do good on streams, look at Rich and Jesse cox
[0:52:23] <cartakus> woolie the spoiler
[0:52:31] <%RayReborne> The housing market Progression was hilarious
[0:52:33] <%VioletHeart> Tell that to Mothmandraws who plays Fate visual novels mid-fight.
[0:52:34] <knight_verse> Pat has gotten the crackhead look down.
[0:52:35] <RyuuAoi> Woolie doesn't ban.
[0:52:36] <+DatAsuna> Because he forgets the good stuff whenever you mention it
[0:52:38] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Yeah you shut the fuck up during raids unless you need to say something important
[0:52:38] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:52:40] <@QueequegTheater> JUST SPOIL THE DATAMINED LETTER, WOOLIE

[0:52:57] <%IronOhki> Do you not know who Woolie is?
[0:52:59] <+MosesUnspoken> LUL
[0:53:00] <Cosairen> mmos are woolie poison i dont know how people have not come to understand it
[0:53:00] <%tomdwarf> Woolie was never going to play it ever.
[0:53:03] <%Bt_Robot> Woolie has several people telling him to play, not just Pat
[0:53:04] <+diegobandzz> Lmao
[0:53:05] <+youngjwilliams> but If you'd really like it maybe try it out as like a bi-weekly thing? unfamiliar with mmos and don't know of that's viable
[0:53:05] <Brandon__Brando> its the best but in the podcast
[0:53:06] <%tentavision> cult indoctrination
[0:53:07] <+DatAsuna> Nothing changed
[0:53:07] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> You can't play an MMO without knowing about the shit parts, come on
[0:53:10] <+diegobandzz> Woolie would never
[0:53:10] <+alphonseisbest> @patstaresat Just wholesale spoil him on the story, come EW LUL
[0:53:11] <Brandon__Brando> bit*
[0:53:17] <+polothegreatest> Chat ruined batman for woolie doodSad
[0:53:24] <RyuuAoi> Woolie will play ff14 in ten more years. Trust me.
[0:53:24] <%Monkeyweed21> Woolie wouldnt play FF14 if it was in a genre HE LIKED for at least 10 years
[0:53:25] <%MelBrooksKA> Pat, we watch you, we're clearly unhinged by default @PatStaresAt
[0:53:26] <%IronOhki> YOU GOTTA LET IT GO, MAN
[0:53:27] <%MidnightBurst12> that man cares -1000% about mmos
[0:53:31] <JetpackMcQuack> make it happen
[0:53:32] <SIydoc> pat you should join woolie and the gang for dokapon
[0:53:36] <%Agami23> fate.
[0:53:37] <cartakus> Batman ruined batman for wookie
[0:53:41] <+DatAsuna> Ohthe FUNNIEST version of that I ever heard was the guy who was convinced that CSB existed because you and woolie were secret trump supporters like them.
[0:53:42] <@QueequegTheater> @polothegreatest Woolie refusing to actually play the game the way it was telling him to ruined Batman for him lmao
[0:53:44] <cartakus> wookie?
[0:53:45] <%RayReborne> We arent TV characters maaaaaaaaan
[0:53:49] <+PMAvers> But, what if he could play Teppen inside FF14...
[0:53:49] <oda_flobunaga> Its a pretty fucked sentiment
[0:53:52] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> I tapped out of the Matt / Woolie LP of FFX because I couldn't handle their negativity, it's real
[0:53:53] <%SveriSageAdvice> i dont even know what to tell people other than you're the main reason i even tried out FFXIV, like i dont get how they come to the conclusion you're only ever negative about it lol
[0:53:54] <%baka_sugoi> O L D
[0:53:56] <KaironFortressKnight> @cartakus Wookie.
[0:53:56] <+lucaflowe> Woolie would never ever touch ff14 it's not his type of game
[0:53:58] <%captain_thickthighs> its a weird validation loop like if the like it then my opions are good
[0:53:58] <%MechArch> ha boomer

[0:54:23] <MiamiMemory> So you're saying that guy was awesome?
[0:54:25] <CatRidder> but fighting games thou
[0:54:26] <the_420_dachshund> woolie wouldn’t cooperate in a raid
[0:54:26] <+DatAsuna> a CAPCOM action game
[0:54:26] <Cosairen> a testament to your friendship really
[0:54:29] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt This is sort of why we don't allow vtuber stuff on the subreddit. They're not TV characters, they're people.
[0:54:30] <+diegobandzz> N woolie wanted nun og it
[0:54:30] <RyuuAoi> Idk the other one. But one of them was Billy.
[0:54:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> to be fair he saw the worst of it
[0:54:32] <+diegobandzz> Of*
[0:54:35] <+alphonseisbest> He likes Jrpgs tho Kappa
[0:54:39] <%RayReborne> @tallguywithahoodie yeah that playthrough was a little rough but then again, Master wizard Wakka Kappa
[0:54:41] <Profmcstevie> An action game....with ryu and dante in it now
[0:54:43] <critfumble_> i love those menu hunter world videos from back in the day
[0:54:47] <%BinaryFireball> woolie just wouldnt have fun
[0:54:49] <Cosairen> woolie would be a big dps pusher
[0:54:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Woolie doesnt even play the popular games in genres he likes
[0:54:50] <%RayReborne> grand wizard excuse me
[0:54:52] <%afronooch> woolie would be better than the average player tbh
[0:54:53] <MiamiMemory> Woolie would be DPS
[0:55:01] <@Spydurman> he would just HATE doing it
[0:55:02] <%MelBrooksKA> He had The Black Gift for FPS games
[0:55:05] <JetpackMcQuack> and he would be stressed and he would be unsatisfied
[0:55:05] <FuzzyKey> I fucking love Monster Hunter but I catch myself only taking about the bad stuff. then I imagine listening to that for over a year
[0:55:08] <oda_flobunaga> I had a roommate who did nothing but practice MetaKnight on Smash Bros
[0:55:08] <%Djinnazz> Rotation = Combos
[0:55:08] <AppleJinx> Woolie doesn't like action games? He loves dmc and ghost of tsushima doesn't he?
[0:55:10] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @RayReborne What's funny is how close to reality Grand Wizard Wakka is for like 90% of the plot
[0:55:11] <@QueequegTheater> "But my parse tho"
[0:55:12] <%valriot> I feel like he'd enjoy some like Monk
[0:55:13] <President_valentine> Just explain it in fighting game terms
[0:55:13] <%notsoy> the gear treadmill sucks dick in every MMO
[0:55:13] <+DatAsuna> gear is the same struggle he has with nioh
[0:55:14] <%SWFanatic> BORK
[0:55:14] <%captain_thickthighs> its like positions people like what they like, no need for a reason
[0:55:15] <+Count_Graagh> bork
[0:55:16] <$grotto_kein> Woolie also super busy
[0:55:16] <peanutdot007> The problem is raids aren't actually that fun for most people not super into them
[0:55:17] <RyuuAoi> Woolie has no time.
[0:55:20] <Profmcstevie> everybody has the thing that walls their brain
[0:55:23] <%coward_man> big shock not all people like the same games
[0:55:26] <%FingaLights> and that's fine
[0:55:29] <%IronOhki> LET IT GO FOR REAL!
[0:55:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it never ends LUL
[0:55:30] <Brandon__Brando> that's what stops me from MMO's but I love hearing about it
[0:55:31] <Cosairen> no one enjoys monk
[0:55:32] <Jontman42> rotation is just the optimal combo over and over
[0:55:32] <@SoFarFetched> People are really missing the point
[0:55:34] <%tomdwarf> He wouldn't enjoy anything, you crazy people. No setup would please him.
[0:55:34] <%RyTYoung> yeah
[0:55:35] <@QueequegTheater> LUL
[0:55:36] <%BinaryFireball> he might like new world strangely enough
[0:55:36] <Ris_Eltrut> mmo shenanigans is woolies mind goblins
[0:55:37] <+diegobandzz> Woolie would do it it’s the rng n such he isnt in to
[0:55:37] <%studleydoorite> he's right
[0:55:38] <ToneBacas> yeh
[0:55:39] <%RayReborne> @tallguywithahoodie yup lol
[0:55:41] <%SWFanatic> Everytime a psaDogchamp Bork a psaJpeg gets its MercyWing1 MercyWing2
[0:55:42] <@GeneralSCPatton> IT WILL NEVER FEEL LIKE A FIGHTING GAME
[0:55:43] <%captain_thickthighs> stop trying to give Woolie into you cheap drugs
[0:55:43] <+Kyma1020> Guy likes style and telling him to do the same series of button presses is cancer to him

[0:55:47] <DeathByPoke7> i hate mmos for the same reason
[0:55:48] <%valriot> But he keeps talking about that bad robot game with cooldowns
[0:55:48] <Brandon__Brando> I hate hotbars so much
[0:55:49] <+NickHatesSnow> I main monk woolie would hate it
[0:55:49] <%MugenSandan> Weird because FF14 convinced me to try out fighting games lol
[0:55:50] <+SilverDevilfish> RTS
[0:55:52] <%cooldude69xx> It's pronounced "anathema"
[0:55:53] <%Agami23> imagine a ff14 character action game
[0:55:54] <SaltyAzteca> lol antihype
[0:55:54] <oda_flobunaga> What about Toribash?
[0:55:56] <Profmcstevie> STOP TELLING SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE CURRY TO TRY A DIFFERENT CURRY
[0:55:57] <cartakus> what if action game plus mmo?
[0:55:58] <%MoguManda> lmaooo
[0:55:58] <+Figleafplays> listen you savages Woolie would never enjoy ff14.
[0:55:58] <+DatAsuna> "but short hair punch girl" says the fool
[0:56:01] <RyuuAoi> If Woolie can't show up for raids every Sunday, he gets kicked from the gang.
[0:56:02] <+MosesUnspoken> PLAY MONK
[0:56:04] <+PMAvers> ...honestly, I kind of want to see a hot-bar combat fighting game now.
[0:56:05] <ToneBacas> and the number mashing nature of MMOs is also not super great
[0:56:06] <@QueequegTheater> Chat needs to look up the definition of "Parasocial relationship"
[0:56:06] <Klarrann3> BDO is the mmo that feels the most like a fighting game
[0:56:13] <SIydoc> do you think he'd play an mmo like black desert thats not hotbar combat?
[0:56:13] <%BinaryFireball> man new world could've been so fucking revolutionary... action rpg mmo ugh
[0:56:14] <@SoFarFetched> People need validation on things they like by having the person they watch like the thing Kappa
[0:56:14] <%notsoy> the fact that the boss never reacts to being hit by your ability is what would really kill it for woolie
[0:56:16] <%coward_man> big shock guys, Woolie would not like the way 14 plays. Almost like it's not for everyone
[0:56:17] <%captain_thickthighs> now i have to google hotbar combact
[0:56:19] <%RayReborne> if he doesnt like a game he doesnt like a game guys lol
[0:56:23] <%MechArch> just tie some macros to a fighting stick
[0:56:25] <%tank7013> Everything about the genre besides maybe the music and environments is tailor made to repel him
[0:56:26] <%Cozy90> What about tank controls MMO?
[0:56:33] <$StrawberryPantsu> Doing your rotation in XIV is like doing a combo in DMC or a fighting game but there is NO hitstun and the only feed back you get is BIG NUMBER!
[0:56:37] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> THE RGIND
[0:56:40] <%studleydoorite> maybe if we give him drugs Woolie will play ffiv
[0:56:44] <%YakumoYomi> @Profmcstevie Bro...have you tried this curry though? Kappa
[0:56:44] <%maenos2> people need to accept not everyone is into mmo.  jesus let it go.
[0:56:45] <+Figleafplays> it then became an mmo
[0:56:46] <@Ranryu692> Woolie would take *years* to get through the MSQ, too
[0:56:47] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> THE GRIND*
[0:56:47] <+DatAsuna> FF14 fans are honestly second only to Fate fans in terms of obnoxiously nonstop shilling their game
[0:56:56] <%tomdwarf> Thats fair
[0:56:57] <@Ranryu692> aesthetic-only gear
[0:56:58] <%SirGO0SE> @studleydoorite lmao
[0:57:02] <+TaurusOxford> Woolie hates "THE GRIND"
[0:57:02] <+BignanasTheGawd> you mean dark souls?
[0:57:05] <MiamiMemory> MMO with complicated button combos
[0:57:05] <Profmcstevie> RPG-less MH would be Woolie mana
[0:57:09] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat COULD you play FF14 with a fighting stick? That could interest him.
[0:57:10] <%AHomeschoolDropout> What's woolie's thoughts on Dragon's Dogma? Although it has great ass combat, it's still mostly gear-based
[0:57:16] <%VintageSpiffy> woolie would dig Dauntless
[0:57:18] <+polothegreatest> end game is cool gear sipsipHellmo
[0:57:20] <+Count_Graagh> hell yeah
[0:57:23] <%captain_thickthighs> its like your individuals
[0:57:25] <+DatAsuna> He didn't play DD
[0:57:25] <Explodincatz> no he wouldnt because there wouldnt be fashion to play with
[0:57:25] <%Shirousuke1989> But you also like FIGHTING GAMES!!
[0:57:29] <delerim001> would wooli play a mmo like elder scroll online or something like that???
[0:57:35] <+KoldFusion87> Dark Souls has stamina bar, fighting games don’t
[0:57:35] <thelonechris> So you would like collect-a-thons?
[0:57:38] <+TaurusOxford> @VintageSpiffy no he wouldn't - that game's combat is flat as fuck.
[0:57:38] <choocheess> he hates there being real world problems in his games, he also loves good gameplay not repetition or shinies
[0:57:38] <%tomdwarf> Nope.
[0:57:39] <SummonerMagno> and catgirls
[0:57:41] <+DatAsuna> Woolie's thoughts on dragon's dogma are that he heard pat say it's good

[0:58:12] <%Jeemukun> woolie doesn't have to like the same things you do! it's ok! you can still like something woolie doesn't like!
[0:58:12] <+MosesUnspoken> I bet he's like PSO2

[0:58:13] <%FingaLights> But... What if??
[0:58:13] <%MelBrooksKA> But Pat, will Woolie like the game I like

[0:58:21] <+diegobandzz> You can lead the horse to water…
[0:58:24] <MiamiMemory> Would Woolie play Habbo Hotel?
[0:58:24] <Ris_Eltrut> dark souls seems like the furthest woolie will go for the gearing aspect
[0:58:25] <oda_flobunaga> Runesacpe maybe?
[0:58:26] <+Catpurnicus> chat is trying to put chie stickers on a keyboard hoping woolie will use it
[0:58:26] <%Agami23> the only mmo i thought woolie would ever like got shut down. basically a character action game
[0:58:27] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Woolie likes the journey (eg rewarding gameplay), Pat likes the destination (seeing number go up)

[0:58:44] <%MoguManda> <Point Deleted>
[0:58:44] <thelonechris> Pat has a hot and/or hard to explain take. In other news, the sky is blue and grass is green.
[0:58:47] <ArOne_Start> I feel monster hunter has a lot of intrinsic rewards so why didn't it catch him?
[0:58:48] <+kewlmyc> LUL
[0:58:49] <+DatAsuna> @CapnClassix I think he would have a mixed opinion of it because the combat is fine but the world and story would totally hit his "eugh generic fantasy" thing
[0:58:52] <+Damie904> Woolie is the most "entrenched in my ways" person ever. Pat's not gonna convince him to try an MMO guys. He was never on board to begin with.
[0:58:53] <Brandon__Brando> LUL
[0:58:53] <%cooldude69xx> He could be more clear if he killed a guy for it

[0:58:56] <radregice> the boy D:
[0:58:57] <KaironFortressKnight> I'd rather Woolie get your ass into new fighting games instead of you getting him into MMOs anyway
[0:59:00] <%SaiyanShoto> PSO is the most actiony MMO I've played
[0:59:01] <$The_Angry_God_Hoogs> rotations is like the backbone of mmo's but does take the fun out of the games.
[0:59:03] <+NickHatesSnow> But did you read All=Star Superman Pat?
[0:59:05] <+PenmanLupine> Woolie is about as surface as a person can get
[0:59:06] <MiamiMemory> Just ask him
[0:59:07] <@QueequegTheater> BUT WHAT IF HE PLAYED *MY* MMO? THEN HE'LL LIKE IT AND WE'LL BECOME GUILDMATES AND THEN BECOME FRIENDS AND HANG OUT TOGETHER ALL THE TIME
[0:59:11] <+MosesUnspoken> Gief will play FFXIV before Woolie does.

[0:59:13] <%Grifsor> @Profmcstevie you're right. it goes in the SQUARE hole
[0:59:13] <%MugenSandan> I think the issue is that people don't really like how Woolie is making himself like the normal person when he super isn't
[0:59:14] <PunishedVenomWolf> woolie would definitely be down for Club Penguin
[0:59:14] <%coward_man> but what if Woolie liked game Woolie liked!?
[0:59:14] <Treasure_Vault> I would watch Pat play creative minecraft for an hour.

[1:00:58] <%Djinnazz> Patches was in Armoured Core

[1:01:03] <+kewlmyc> Patches will 100% be in Elden Ring
[1:01:03] <%MelBrooksKA> @QueequegTheater QueequegTheather
[1:01:03] <Profmcstevie> I hope Patches is right before the final boss and throws you at it
[1:01:03] <%KnightOfTrousers> Y'all I never considered that, I want that now
[1:01:04] <%captain_thickthighs> i want him to be a mimic at this point
[1:01:04] <%WackyGear> is patches a Miyazaki self-insert
[1:01:05] <Jontman42> yeah just like Patches was in Sekiro
[1:01:05] <%tomdwarf> Id be more surprised if he wasnt in it, honestly.
[1:01:05] <%FingaLights> Patches, Moonlight are in
[1:01:06] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Elden Ring Patches needs to be 100% trustworthy.
[1:01:07] <%BinaryFireball> i mean yea
[1:01:09] <royb2> KICK YOU OFF A CLIFF DUH
[1:01:09] <+LokimenD> Will an Armored Core be in Elden RIng?
[1:01:09] <+Stormzcales_Lair> If he was in Bloodborne...
[1:01:10] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> UNTIL THE HEEL TURN
[1:01:15] <SIydoc> according to a leaker you meat patches and have to fight him after you accidently rob him
[1:01:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> be patched
[1:01:17] <HoboFlea> Pat, as a long-time DMC fan, and more recent Nioh Fan (2 years) I am AS WE SPEAK finally really playing Dark Souls in preparation for Elden Ring. This is 90% due to your stream on it. So thank you!
[1:01:18] <$IzazaOzihaha> Patches will now be played by George R R Martin.
[1:01:18] <%SharkMissile> What if he dabs on us
[1:01:19] <%SWFanatic> What if he good?
[1:01:20] <%Mr_Pylon> I want him to strand the player on an island
[1:01:20] <%Agami23> he'll give you a horse with a bomb attached
[1:01:20] <@QueequegTheater> @MelBrooksKA Yes?
[1:01:21] <MiamiMemory> George R.R Martin as "Patches"
[1:01:21] <OneThousandTomatoes> patches*
[1:01:22] <%sniffy77> they're gonna have to mix it up with elden patches
[1:01:25] <%studleydoorite> maybe he's just a good guy this time :)
[1:01:26] <+theomnisoup> They put in Mild Mannered Pate
[1:01:27] <CatRidder> i ll try to steal your horse
[1:01:30] <%IronOhki> Do you think the Moonlight Greatsword will be in Elden Ring? You mean the reference that is as old as King's Field?
[1:01:33] <+diegobandzz> Some sick shit prolly
[1:01:33] <%MelBrooksKA> @QueequegTheater hi
[1:01:34] <OneThousandTomatoes> and then he default dances on you
[1:01:34] <azure_dunes> he will be as he always has been
[1:01:36] <%Sotetsu> As long as Patches is up to no good, and starts making trouble in the neighborhood
[1:01:36] <%BinaryFireball> maybe patches will just be running from a horde of dudes across the map for the entire game
[1:01:37] <RyuuAoi> What if he is the final boss?
[1:01:37] <%justcallmebobplease> He should be nice the whole way through the game while sounding nefarious - helping in boss fights even... right up until the final boss, where he permanently joins to make it a dual-boss.
[1:01:37] <soggy_mess> Hi everyone
[1:01:38] <+trizetacannon44> What if he's honest and good?
[1:01:38] <Pengers> Was he in sekiro?
[1:01:39] <Hamborgini> at the end of the game, it turns out you were patches all along
[1:01:39] <%RayReborne> He'll sell you the Onion Knight set again Kappa
[1:01:40] <%SirGO0SE> i wish the arrows patches sold you broke
[1:01:44] <srv4254> old man final boss again calling it
[1:01:52] <+NickHatesSnow> yeeeeee
[1:01:52] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:01:55] <%tank7013> Patches kicks you down a pit but then jumps in after you to help you fight off the monster ambush because the years of guilt have consumed him
[1:01:56] <%SWFanatic> Goboboblins
[1:01:57] <%SWFanatic> BORK
[1:01:58] <SaltyAzteca> Just sell em all!
[1:01:58] <soggy_mess> Please no Patches
[1:02:00] <DSD24> They fixed it that
[1:02:01] <primaryfire> just sort by power dummy
[1:02:01] <%afronooch> yeah
[1:02:04] <Profmcstevie> Loot sorting in loot games is REAL easy to fuck up
[1:02:04] <%Djinnazz> you could always do that.
[1:02:05] <$shanna_become_gamer> chat vs video lag = you're all bork whisperers
[1:02:05] <SaltyAzteca> Yes you can do that
[1:02:08] <@QueequegTheater> Yeah that's fair
[1:02:12] <%Speed1ines> Speed1ines subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Can't wait for Mind Goblins! Nioh 2! (Leaving the first game incomplete) But seriously Nioh is fun and I hope it clicks!
[1:02:12] <+DatAsuna> the secret is just sort by level, equip the first one, then hit "sell all" on everything else lol
[1:02:14] <%SWFanatic> psaGiefrail psaGib
[1:02:14] <MiamiMemory> Anyone here like Dead Cells? I'm playing that now.
[1:02:14] <%valriot> You literally just organise via damage and pick the one thats good
[1:02:16] <%SaiyanShoto> You could always sort by strength
[1:02:19] <%RayReborne> i sold all white and yellow stuff or dismantled all yellow and some blues for Forging
[1:02:19] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> doesn't matter, some of it might have things you can fuse on to other weapons
[1:02:20] <%Sotetsu> Who barks at a pineapple under the couch?
[1:02:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah I think you can set it to auto sell as well, or so that you can't even pick up low rarity stuff
[1:02:22] <amiavamp> Even in Nioh 2 NG++ the vast majority of things you pick up are "is attack gooder" or "is defense gooder" and throwing out everything else
[1:02:24] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt Yes, there are filtering tools in all "trashbag" menus. (Shrine, Shop, etc)
[1:02:25] <Profmcstevie> every video I saw of 2077 the loot sorting system looked gross
[1:02:26] <Treasure_Vault> @Profmcstevie 100%. I wish borderlands had eight guns total.
[1:02:28] <zanzibarian_hamster> The gear treadmill in Nioh is the worst, it's just stat go up
[1:02:30] <%MechArch> psaGiefrail
[1:02:30] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @DatAsuna I like that solution
[1:02:32] <+DatAsuna> Only in postgame do you worry about gear really because that's when the last tier unlocks
[1:02:32] <CatRidder> paige help the boy
[1:02:34] <MrDrayko> I think Nioh has the most loot sorting control I've ever seen
[1:02:35] <%captain_thickthighs> your spoiling him he has to learn to do for himself
[1:02:39] <Jontman42> pick the sword that's in top of the list
[1:02:41] <Mildly_Eccentric> I want elden ring patches to only tell the truth and when you don't believe him he just shoots you with an actual real ass gun
[1:02:45] <%RyTYoung> it's all good psaUp
[1:02:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> hit the button that tells you what the best one is then use that
[1:02:46] <didgereedoodah> just pick the biggest number
[1:02:52] <%SWFanatic> Hey what if God of War but the boy was Zangief
[1:02:52] <%CheesesSliced> Pat, your unkempt state makes you look like a crazed arti
[1:02:52] <%Djinnazz> @zanzibarian_hamster we just had this discussion...
[1:02:53] <Treasure_Vault> Loot shooting feels worse than weapon upgrading.
[1:03:00] <oda_flobunaga> In Nioh, gear only matters in NG +
[1:03:06] <%Anthrozzz> give it to him lol
[1:03:07] <%SinnerEbru> idk why people ask what the goblin is, bc i was about to then i saw the stream title

[1:03:24] <OneThousandTomatoes> show us the rug geif
[1:03:25] <$shanna_become_gamer> dog controoooool
[1:03:26] <%Sotetsu> First you get the pineapple, then you get the dog, then you get women.
[1:03:28] <$IzazaOzihaha> You got a pen with that pineapple?
[1:03:28] <BigFingerRo> Mineapple
[1:03:29] <%SWFanatic> psaJpeg
[1:03:31] <+DatAsuna> Basically, you can only gets "rares" until you beat chapter 5, so everything until then iss disposable until legendaries unlock
[1:03:35] <RyuuAoi> Pat, Woolie wont tell us about his Grenada dog. Make him please.
[1:03:40] <+trackles_64> Geeef
[1:03:41] <BigFingerRo> THAT'S why we pay pat the big bucks

[1:04:16] <CatRidder> he talk about it at some point
[1:04:16] <Johannen> You mean the dog that had to fight rats for food?
[1:04:17] <%justcallmebobplease> That he had to beat rats off of.
[1:04:20] <@Lion_kun> Didn't he get eaten by rats?

[1:14:34] <%IronOhki> psaDogchamp NEED
[1:14:35] <emil_hunter1> He almost ate Pat's fingers
[1:14:38] <amiavamp> Nioh gaslights you into thinking you should be using the 100 items it gives you by giving you just enough that if you actually try to use them you run out immediately
[1:14:38] <oda_flobunaga> Twin Swords, Water Sword, Lightning Buff, Done
[1:14:39] <OneThousandTomatoes> if it doesn't click this time would you be willing to give up on 1 and go to 2?

[1:15:38] <Sonny_Firestorm> @DatAsuna I think the first 70% are pretty good.
[1:15:44] <+DatAsuna> Likewise I don't think dragon's dogma gets good until you're 95% through it lmao
[1:15:48] <@QueequegTheater> HE MUST FEED
[1:15:52] <Profmcstevie> F.I.S.T posting? Hell yeah F.I.S.T

[1:15:59] <jorniev> METAL GEAR 4
[1:16:00] <oda_flobunaga> I actually never completed Nioh 1, I got to Maria of the Tiny Fuck Room and stopped.
[1:16:01] <+JustToWatch> Nioh 2 good game
[1:16:02] <amiavamp> Nioh 2 is less mind gobliny because you basically have a mana bar
[1:16:03] <Sonny_Firestorm> What even is a mind goblin?
[1:16:07] <Sonny_Firestorm> First I've heard of it.
[1:16:07] <@QueequegTheater> Full DD1 LP
[1:16:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that would be pretty rad, but only if you end up liking nioh in the first place
[1:16:08] <$grotto_kein> Subnatica goblin?
[1:16:10] <CatRidder> the finale should be life
[1:16:14] <%SinnerEbru> LUL helluva gobolin

[1:16:21] <MicrotonalMatt> Not using a mega elixir before the last boss?
[1:16:22] <%RealThiele> striking that dumpster iron
[1:16:24] <HoboFlea> defeating the mind goblin is just skipping the gozuki, the rest of the game is easy going
[1:16:26] <@QueequegTheater> @grotto_kein Subnautica isn't a goblin, just open ocean fear
[1:16:26] <%BoxNavy> paigeuhhh
[1:16:28] <+DatAsuna> @DatAsuna It's fine, but I was playing it for the gameplay then, and the story was still fairly light on big showdowns and cool context
[1:16:28] <$IzazaOzihaha> Nioh's always been great. It's the 70% where it gets easy.
[1:16:33] <adamant1333> foor fetish
