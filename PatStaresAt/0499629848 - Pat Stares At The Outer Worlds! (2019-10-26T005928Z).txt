[0:00:58] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Right as Parvati commented.
[0:01:00] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AngriestPat Pavarti said Edgewater gonna miss the Vicar
[0:01:01] <vexicbayn> "folks around here are gonna miss you"

[0:01:08] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat "Parvati was in the middle of saying people were going to miss their vicar"
[0:01:09] <deafmutelaughing> you were too excited
[0:01:11] <%Dr_Mooose> I wish that got captured
[0:01:11] <StromkoPenguin> It sensed excitement and died.
[0:01:11] <+TheStarvingGood> OBS doesnt want to see you happy Pat
[0:01:12] <WarchiefGoldva> It cut out when Parvati was talking about how Edgewater was gonna miss the Vicar @AngriestPat
[0:01:12] <Rashnam> Bell sounds awful, but I really hope it's more stable for you.
[0:01:14] <%Run44forrest> parvati said folks are gonna miss you

[0:02:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @koosahmii Yup
[0:02:52] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Koosahmii yes, you hit the nail on the head.
[0:02:53] <count_bob> Pat you look like a dirty hobo.
[0:02:59] <Rashnam> ah
[0:03:12] <cureneckbeard> put luck to 50
[0:03:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ever heard of Vitiligo? Well Woolie's got Religion-vitiligo
[0:03:16] <%XeroSigmaPrime> wait so its more efficient on levels to balance every category to have the same state number in Character Creation?
[0:03:17] <%Kataguro> Stealth for Hack 40?
[0:03:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @koosahmii Theres even a company in the game called Firefly. They make the gun ammo
[0:03:20] <CrabSlacks> only being able to have on companion is lame. Need an army of goons.
[0:03:26] <%MegboyManuel> so does this game, not have dope ass music, like in new vegas?
[0:03:31] <$mysterypork> Pat the dirty Space Hobo
[0:03:34] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Lock Picking has been my saving grace in this game, and seeing Pats so low is making me ruuCry
[0:03:44] <a_mad_dragon> increase dong
[0:03:46] <%floralkami> Pat level go up, but Squirrel level go higher
[0:03:49] <%Run44forrest> im pretty sure you can have multiple companions
[0:03:50] <%3Xgilly> DECREASE INT
[0:03:54] <TheTunnelSn8ke> We got ourselves our own preacher man.
[0:03:55] <%Kataguro> Lockpicking 20 is REALLY good
[0:03:57] <%MegboyManuel> I havent heard any good tunes in this game at all
[0:04:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> Get a varmit rifle to kill that squirrel
[0:04:04] <Monkeyweed21> do big stealth
[0:04:10] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Yeah, absolutely get lockpick to 20
[0:04:10] <+MrN64> Lockpicking is really worth the investment
[0:04:14] <SparkAfterDark> Stealth archer run
[0:04:15] <%TeaJayGee> all in luck
[0:04:21] <cureneckbeard> lucky ted stealths his way through the dark souls world
[0:04:22] <Vohs_Bru> its been a while since I saw Pats feet on stream
[0:04:27] <%Run44forrest> LuckiestPat
[0:04:29] <%MegboyManuel> get sneak atleast for sneak attack yeah
[0:04:30] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Mind goblin time: Wouldnt it be better in character creation to have all stats under same category to have same number? So you dont have a wasteful level that only levels two parts later?
[0:04:45] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Oh godf
[0:04:58] <%Swish19XX> Defense at 20 gets you a dodge
[0:05:08] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I'd recommend the ones on the right for companions
[0:05:11] <%Run44forrest> get sneaky AND bolsterous
[0:05:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> Upgrade her to Cheesepuff
[0:05:17] <%MegboyManuel> You can make companions take enmity??????
[0:05:25] <$Mothman742> so chat..... parvaati or ADA?
[0:05:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Specialisation makes it so if you dont plan properly, you can waste several levels of skill points
[0:05:28] <%Kataguro> Wow, just snubbing Cheese
[0:05:34] <%MegboyManuel> Holy shit there's an aggro system in this game?
[0:05:34] <%Run44forrest> pffft parvati
[0:05:35] <%dekkitout> @Mothman742 BOTH
[0:05:37] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Mothman742 Yes.

[0:06:07] <%king_wragles> it's TOO pretty
[0:06:07] <+VashyronM> So, this is the first time watching this game. Do you actually travel in your ship or is it just a home base?
[0:06:07] <$Mothman742> i see we have smart people in chat Kappa
[0:06:07] <Zalthia> dizzy
[0:06:08] <%SomeSageAdvice> looks fine\

[0:06:24] <%floralkami> PLEASE, IT'S DYING SO HARD
[0:06:24] <%Run44forrest> look at the dust
[0:06:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Turn screen effects to medium, reduces the god awful FXAA in the distance (makes it hellah blurrry)
[0:06:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> It's super good.
[0:06:29] <%Run44forrest> PogChamp
[0:06:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> I have played it live and it looks GREAT
[0:06:37] <+MrN64> Be sure to talk to your party members in your ship from time to time Pat, they can sometimes tell you about shit
[0:06:38] <hntronium> I don't know what anti-aliasing is
[0:06:38] <redrins> thats actually impressive
[0:06:41] <Vohs_Bru> high poly models?
[0:06:51] <%Zamorouskiwhich> This game looks and runs amazingly
[0:06:53] <+AllenDeadman> I'm watching this stream at 160p pat, EVERYTHIONG LOOKS LIKE SHIT TO ME REGARDLESS
[0:06:53] <%XeroSigmaPrime> the FXAA sucks for long distances, makes far away things hellah blurry
[0:06:54] <reiju_22> cirWut
[0:06:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> FUCK OFF ADA
[0:06:55] <%johnny_gogo> @AngriestPat even on 1080p its really good too

[0:07:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> @AllenDeadman That sounds like a you problem.
[0:07:09] <%floralkami> if only
[0:07:10] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @hntronium AA makes it so the edges of things don't appear rough and jagged.

[0:07:15] <+AllenDeadman> it is
[0:07:17] <polar_kare> Hey @angriestpat theres a great weapon your companion can use in a canyon on the map. Becareful getting to it tho
[0:07:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's no smuggler bird ship, but it'll do
[0:07:23] <%MegboyManuel> So is there an aggro system in this game with companions?
[0:07:24] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat you can't get vicar max till you finish the main quest in this area
[0:07:28] <cureneckbeard> where's elmo

[0:07:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> @MegboyManuel Yes.
[0:07:38] <closetgremlin12> Hey Pat, how are you liking this?
[0:07:40] <WarchiefGoldva> Shotgun's only working at literal mêlée range.
[0:07:45] <%MegboyManuel> fuck thats cool
[0:07:55] <bear_breaker20> you playing on normal, hard ?
[0:08:02] <%Kataguro> Pat's character looks like Hobo Robin
[0:08:06] <SGrim> Hey chat and Pat, what have I missed since yesterday?
[0:08:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> The gunplay in this game is surprisingly less videogamey than you'd expect.
[0:08:08] <mrcelab> Vicar is upstairs lol
[0:08:09] <+yasahiro1011> @bear_breaker20 easy mode
[0:08:11] <+yasahiro1011> unlocked
[0:08:15] <Zalthia> @AngriestPat So, tell me about the game. I've heard its the "spiritual successor to New Vegas". Is this true?
[0:08:20] <Monkeyweed21> its fine @AngriestPat
[0:08:28] <Gruhunchously> @rumtumtugnutz How do you mean?
[0:08:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> hold on
[0:08:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> This game is Fallout New Vegas in space.
[0:08:42] <%Run44forrest> @SGrim got max's book it was in french so he got angry and joined your party
[0:08:43] <%XeroSigmaPrime> The FXAA on far away stuff makes it HELLAH blurry, turn Screen Effects to medium (FXAA is tied to that setting)
[0:08:45] <%CalderGaming> i can see the fps counter, nbd
[0:08:45] <+RSNoon> 50 is bad????
[0:08:47] <%terminallyCapriciousz> He went to Normal AFAIK
[0:08:48] <bear_breaker20> ive been playing this on hard and its a pretty different experience @yasahiro1011
[0:08:50] <+MrN64> @Zalthia It's similar to New Vegas in a lot of ways, but in space and with big QoL improvements
[0:08:52] <%crimsonharvest> i got much better framerate by turning it to real Fullscreen
[0:08:56] <cureneckbeard> the eye can't see higher than 24fps
[0:08:58] <%floralkami> @zalthia last stream, he compared it as a great mix of NV, KOTOR, and Bioshock
[0:09:11] <Vohs_Bru> Mr Crazy talk was right this time
[0:09:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Gruhunchously Well, your companions can aggro enemies, and you can aggro your companions if you dismiss then shoot them.
[0:09:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @cureneckbeard lol I remember that
[0:09:16] <Monkeyweed21> what about the line? @AngriestPat
[0:09:17] <%AnIcedCoffee> Yeah I can't run it at ultra while streaming either
[0:09:18] <%Dr_Mooose> wow that's impressive
[0:09:22] <a_mad_dragon> it's almost like they actually cared Kappa
[0:09:23] <+AllenDeadman> nice
[0:09:24] <%TaifuDragon> I used detect settings and it put all of it to Low. Detect settings is a bitch ass motherfucker
[0:09:27] <cureneckbeard> i need 60fps for walking around an empty town!
[0:09:27] <%Kataguro> KILL
[0:09:28] <%MegboyManuel> LOL
[0:09:29] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Once you get the ship, I'd describe it as Mass Effect, but inspired by Firefly instead of Star Trek
[0:09:29] <%3Xgilly> LUL
[0:09:29] <%depressed_skeleton> nice
[0:09:30] <LilMKatsu> LUL
[0:09:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> It is VERY POSSIBLE to accidentally fire your companions.
[0:09:31] <Ion_Laser> :D
[0:09:32] <hntronium> LUL
[0:09:32] <%MegboyManuel> ALMOST a bad
[0:09:32] <%mh9s> LUL
[0:09:33] <%SilvaChariot0133> monkaS
[0:09:35] <+Buzzkill983> NV, KOTOR, and Bioshock? My three favorite games?
[0:09:37] <camelwizard> g u n
[0:09:38] <%SergeEXE> LMAO
[0:09:42] <%EmptyMug> For some reason they combined multiple settings, with AA seemingly tied to "Post Processing"
[0:09:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> shooooot the cheeeeese
[0:09:43] <%SilvaChariot0133> WTB safety
[0:09:45] <%terminallyCapriciousz> can someone make a meme of that?
[0:09:52] <%Zamorouskiwhich> It's almost like someone who knew what they were doing made this game ruuThink
[0:09:57] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat don't worry they took the creamy center out of fallout 4(aka all the good parts like looting modding and companions)
[0:09:58] <%Kataguro> Julius is a bitch
[0:10:07] <%terminallyCapriciousz> (Rambling, pulls out his gun) "OH FUCKING SHI--" (Jojo's to be continued meme)
[0:10:12] <Vohs_Bru> Welcome to my Crap Shop
[0:10:24] <%Kataguro> It's a feature
[0:10:25] <+chippracoon> I'm playing in supernova and I cant keep my companion alive at all.
[0:10:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> Thanks for the bits, bitch
[0:10:28] <%Madbearv> who's ready for pat's internet to go down in 10 minutes
[0:10:29] <%crimsonharvest> you can tag them all as junk and sell with one button at the end
[0:10:38] <+AllenDeadman> I'd giv parvati a better gun tbh
[0:10:39] <1matheuw> f?
[0:10:41] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Oh neat, I just noticed you can turn off showing skill stat requirements for speech checks
[0:10:43] <Gruhunchously> Y'know, I am impressed by Ashly Burch's versatility. I never recognize her voice.
[0:10:46] <%dekkitout> Pat, you sold the Paciencia -or whatever the joke from the NV streams was-
[0:10:47] <brandonkl9190> does this game have a third person view?
[0:10:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> A friend of mine calls Obsidian Obshittyan because in his words, 'they couldn't come up with a good idea so they ripped off Borderlands.'
[0:10:53] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Hold x to sell junk
[0:10:55] <%Run44forrest> you sold your sick landing suit???
[0:10:59] <Ion_Laser> @dekkitout Rat Slayer
[0:10:59] <%floralkami> it's almost like these guys at Obsidian didn't get rushed into pushing out an unfinished product
[0:11:03] <darcfowler1995> been playing the game a little bit is it wrong to be sexually attracted to the ship
[0:11:10] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Pat, there's a dedicated sell junk button
[0:11:12] <grayjammer> That's cute as hell
[0:11:13] <%Kataguro> Sure did
[0:11:14] <Monkeyweed21> YOU DID

[0:11:43] <%Dr_Mooose> @darcfowler1995 it's wrong not to be attracted to the ship

[0:12:35] <anAngryHamster> worst song on Abbey Road
[0:12:38] <Decsevm> I just realized that the colony is so poor that it cant even afford to repair the vending machine for years
[0:12:42] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Also, you can sort by weight to value ratio, which is great
[0:12:48] <%3Xgilly> but its COOL
[0:12:51] <42nfl19> But it was good to know that there was an option!
[0:12:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's really not a very good suit of armor
[0:12:53] <%Run44forrest> its cool tho
[0:12:54] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Why the heck is there a beatles reference in this corporate pit?
[0:13:03] <%Deadpal> holy shit pat
[0:13:06] <%NovaKnightmare> What a shithole
[0:13:11] <+D00msDayDan> 16 actually
[0:13:17] <%Deadpal> did you see the chris avellone tweet from 2 days ago at bethesda and obsidian about outer worlds?
[0:13:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> Beatles are overrated. Fight me.
[0:13:22] <%dekkitout> Phrasing?

[0:13:30] <%Dr_Mooose> mmmm fingers
[0:13:33] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter Somebody on the team is likely a fan.
[0:13:35] <+AllenDeadman> finger hunting PogChamp
[0:13:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> itchy. tasty.
[0:13:43] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie Overrated, yeah. But still good.
[0:13:43] <Ion_Laser> @GarbageQueenEllie Lennon is very overrated
[0:13:45] <fusedforms> I believe the technical term is "to go fingering"
[0:13:45] <%crimsonharvest> On the one hand I don't want to do anything that benefits the management structure of this corporation, but I also want to get paid.
[0:13:49] <+Grayhammatter> PogChamp
[0:13:49] <+yasahiro1011> Dodging forward is not double jump
[0:13:49] <%Kataguro> How powerful
[0:13:50] <+yasahiro1011> it's Air Dash
[0:13:53] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie I won't fight you. They're fine, but definitely over rated.
[0:13:54] <ginjais> I'm already really feelin the look of this and,, fuck, I didn't need *more* games to buy and play
[0:14:03] <Technicaus> awww yeah, pat's gonna get fingered
[0:14:07] <%dekkitout> Naturally, Spectrum Vodka would be red...
[0:14:09] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie It sort of comes with being one of the most famous bands ever.
[0:14:11] <%floralkami> @it_is_simple i think that would really depend on what style of game you like, shlooter, or character action
[0:14:15] <MadDesperado13> the Beatles like Sinatra are trash
[0:14:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> The game calls it a double jump, but it's an air dash
[0:14:19] <mrcelab> 100% no
[0:14:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> I like "Here Comes the Sun" though. It's alright
[0:14:38] <%CalderGaming> I Hate The Bands You Like
[0:14:38] <42nfl19> No respawns means no grinding?
[0:14:39] <turqrazor> was pat alive in the 80s?
[0:14:39] <%dalmek> the best thing from the Beatles is Ringo Starr's drawings
[0:14:44] <%umbypokochan> "Why Don't We Do It in the Road" is a banger
[0:14:44] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[0:14:46] <%dalmek> they're goddamn INCREDIBLE
[0:14:48] <%Dr_Mooose> yeah
[0:14:49] <%CalderGaming> @turqrazor yup

[0:15:15] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 15m.
[0:15:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> JUMP IN THE LAVA
[0:15:24] <%RupanSen> Pillars tho
[0:15:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> The more I look at it, the more I like it.
[0:15:27] <%CalderGaming> @King_Wolf_Rigger i would say some were especially alive in the 80s, thanks to the cocaine
[0:15:31] <startadevy> oh hello
[0:15:37] <Ids560> I dunno Pilars and Tyranny look alright
[0:15:41] <Gruhunchously> Didn't Leonard Boyarski work on this game?
[0:15:41] <%dekkitout> I have to ask, what causes those geological formations near lava that makes those hexagon rocks?
[0:15:42] <%floralkami> wow, the lava has heatwaves
[0:15:42] <startadevy> GOODBYE
[0:15:47] <KasiCrafter> I wonder if it's faster to jump and dodge to the side than to walk walk. Would probably look like an asshole crab walking on springs.
[0:15:52] <%CalderGaming> are pillars and tyranny both isometric RPGs tho
[0:15:54] <+Roundelay11> God, I really wish this game leads to Obsidian getting more credit and doing bigger games like this more often
[0:15:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @CalderGaming The cocaine was very much alive in the 80s.
[0:15:55] <thebiganxiety> Pillars art style was strong
[0:16:00] <KasiCrafter> *just walk
[0:16:05] <%Kataguro> Yeah, you sure are
[0:16:05] <%slicestubby> the art style reminds me of maybe like a borderlands meets fallout style what do you think Pat
[0:16:15] <+Cyber_Beep> @AngriestPat So how does this feel in comparison to new vegas?
[0:16:17] <Gruhunchously> Well, the average citizen has never been outside the walls, so...
[0:16:22] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Parvati is canonically a shut in though.
[0:16:24] <Zalthia> Doggos!
[0:16:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> Parvati is company property, Pat. She's probably barely ever left Edgewater
[0:16:38] <%Kataguro> Inhale!
[0:16:38] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Pavarti is great
[0:16:39] <Zalthia> Look at that bandit armor! It's so pretty and colorful!
[0:16:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> @thebiganxiety I wish they kept the Elves' looks more similar to the first game, but I still love it
[0:16:46] <+Grayhammatter> uh... what
[0:16:50] <+AllenDeadman> MORE DAKKA

[0:17:12] <Fear_Ranjer> What is that the chaingun from Duke Nukem?
[0:17:12] <%Valdorick> Pat fights crouched, because he immerses himself in his role. He's shooting at the exact height he would be if he was in the game Kappa

[0:33:05] <+OkamiDude15> @crimsonharvest on the character set up you can take redistribute attribute points like taking some from inteligence and unlock dumb dialouge options because "words are hard"

[0:40:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Now save the game again
[0:40:28] <LegendGHT> is this game worth 60 and stopping my fallout 4 playthrough again?
[0:40:30] <%Kataguro> Not on Supernova though
[0:40:32] <%dalmek> no concussion this time either
[0:40:34] <krymzen5> no brain damage either :)
[0:40:37] <+OkamiDude15> @LegendGHT seems like it
[0:40:38] <%Valdorick> Now if only you could live more.

[0:40:55] <WarchiefGoldva> Didn't even get a concussion this time.
[0:40:55] <cascadepersona> @legendght You can get it for $1 with Xbox game pass
[0:40:57] <%Valdorick> With, like, say, some kinda of armor, that was powerful, a... power armor... of some sort.
[0:40:58] <the_Punktuation> destiny magnetism is this game has not
[0:41:04] <%electrokev007> how do you join the twitch discord again

[0:41:22] <CrabSlacks> to bad you killed so many that no one will ever believe the story
[0:41:28] <+supaXmugen> even just the training area is a bitch to get through
[0:41:32] <$xXRealGamerThaigeXx> you decide on a specific type of build yet or are you still keeping everything relatively even
[0:41:50] <LegendGHT> no xbox, shit pc so 60 or nothing for me
[0:41:56] <%Saltmeisterr> hes going for gun, medical, dialogue
[0:42:05] <%Saltmeisterr> iirc
[0:42:05] <+yasahiro1011> @xXRealGamerThaigeXx what if he needs them later
[0:42:08] <cascadepersona> @legendght My apologies., then. But yes, the game is very good with meaningful dialogue choices and decisions.
[0:42:19] <+supaXmugen> Best build in an obsidian RPG is "Talk no jutsu" build! everyone knows that.
[0:42:20] <@lewdskeletor13> Just got home, I miss anything major?
[0:42:26] <%zv1neda> @AngriestPat how you liking the game so far? what's your favorite thing about it?
[0:42:29] <%Kataguro> Don't miss the two big boy loots
[0:42:30] <%GarbageNirvana> This game isn't really that resource intensive from the looks of things
[0:42:36] <aeonicvector> @lewdskeletor13 So he's been grinding off screen.....
[0:42:37] <MadDesperado13> He finished Vicars mission
[0:42:43] <$xXRealGamerThaigeXx> I think everyone goes max dialogue their first playthrough of an rpg
[0:42:44] <+MrN64> @lewdskeletor13 The vicar is going to be a companion now

[0:43:56] <@lewdskeletor13> Yes

[0:47:05] <%valkuma> the shotguns are very disappointing but if youre actually in somethings face its GG
[0:47:07] <@commanderclaw> I mean, Spacer's Choice is nothing but shitty mass produced crap
[0:47:12] <%valkuma> especially if you stick plasma on the shotgun
[0:47:15] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s not the best choice, it’s Spacers Choice
[0:47:19] <%GarbageNirvana> First shotty is pretty trash
[0:47:20] <%Kiiper> oh, has he not found GL yet?

[0:47:39] <KasiCrafter> Can you use a bench to repair it yourself?
[0:47:45] <NeroInfinite> That was some fallout shit there
[0:47:46] <%valkuma> the shock GL kills mechs in twice as much ammo as the plasma rifle does :D
[0:47:47] <aeonicvector> he could
[0:47:50] <@lewdskeletor13> Look at that WW propaganda poster
[0:47:58] <KasiCrafter> That is, if Breaking Down junk can give you the resources to do it.

[0:48:23] <%Kiiper> plasma rifle also uses 5x more ammo
[0:48:25] <%dekkitout> Now whenever I hear that a game has grenade launchers, I think they're good like Destiny 2's grenade launchers... FeelsBadMan
[0:48:27] <Monkeyweed21> give the machine gun to Parvati
[0:48:33] <WarchiefGoldva> Patron isn't very good at the tinkering.
[0:48:39] <%crimsonharvest> big deal it wastes your time which is far more valuable
[0:48:39] <al0nem0nster> do you get exp from doing it yourself?
[0:48:41] <marshallventure> did pat kill god yet?
[0:48:41] <flyingavocad0s> Parvati needs a lmg

[0:50:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> buy those guns back like the australian government
[0:50:04] <Monkeyweed21> says the man who spent 20 minutes redoing a fight cuz he made a bad choice
[0:50:09] <%Kataguro> There's a guy leaning against a rock that has a Combat Shotgun, yeah

[0:50:27] <%crimsonharvest> it doesnt matter shes an npc
[0:50:28] <masterofthemash> they have got to make the text bigger in this game
[0:50:28] <%king_wragles> 2
[0:50:29] <%Kataguro> I'm like 80% sure it's always there since a friend also found it on the same corpse
[0:50:33] <@lewdskeletor13> She like hammer
[0:50:33] <Monkeyweed21> thats wrong pat
[0:50:35] <deafmutelaughing> pabovo
[0:50:36] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat go to her stats
[0:50:38] <@commanderclaw> Parvati is a precious cinnamon bun
[0:50:39] <%BreakingRatchet> npc dont care dude
[0:50:52] <deafmutelaughing> she looks like a Gears character
[0:51:01] <Gruhunchously> Big Melee Damage
[0:51:07] <Frog_of_Justic> But now she is your Sister of Battle wifu
[0:51:07] <Monkeyweed21> dps vs damage
[0:51:11] <+punit216> dps
[0:51:11] <%QuadraticGravity> thats per shot
[0:51:12] <+AllenDeadman> didn't you have a revolver?
[0:51:13] <CrabSlacks> but wouldn't she be shooting faster
[0:51:13] <TyrantBelial> Yes but the one handed gun shoots less
[0:51:13] <%crimsonharvest> that dps vs damage nerd
[0:51:14] <Lucifer753> @AngriestPat are you playin the super hardcore mode where u gotta eat, drink and sleep?
[0:51:14] <TDAWS_MP132> dps tho
[0:51:14] <%Run44forrest> nah its just the pistol does more damage per shot
[0:51:16] <Torruun> Is that damage per bullet, or dps?
[0:51:17] <StromkoPenguin> That's probably per shot not DPS
[0:51:17] <TyrantBelial> that's not dps that's damage
[0:51:19] <%floralkami> DPS
[0:51:22] <%Niney_Who> But LMG = More bullets
[0:51:32] <RyanTheRecluse> That’s per shot
[0:51:34] <Tucker0603> BUT MORE DAKKA
[0:51:43] <Monkeyweed21> she doesn't use ammo so no harm done
[0:51:43] <WarchiefGoldva> Her armor looks awesome, where did you get that?
[0:51:48] <%dalmek> oh no Pat's doing big bullet combos instead of numbers
[0:51:50] <CrabSlacks> that's good
[0:52:00] <+yasahiro1011> It's like Dark Phoenix
[0:52:02] <+yasahiro1011> You can't control it

[0:53:45] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie How do you get new workers then? Grow them in tanks?
[0:53:50] <Monkeyweed21> @GarbageQueenEllie no sex is encouraged but abortion is destruction of company property

[0:54:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> Do you think they sell company-branded condoms? Or moomoos?
[0:54:17] <+AllenDeadman> I'd argue that the remains are less shitty than the actual town
[0:54:22] <%mh9s> in retrospect calling it "Shittier Edgewater" was a poor marketing decision
[0:54:27] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I just found a pistol that uses heavy ammo lol

[0:58:17] <WarchiefGoldva> She looks like she came straight out of Fallout.
[0:58:19] <krymzen5> @lewdskeletor13 -5 to mind
[0:58:26] <%ChaosVulpes> Pat sees new wildlife, doesn't pause for a moment to see if it's even hostile.... just 'What the fuck are you!?! Well you're dead in a moment..."
[0:58:27] <Ner234> @GarbageQueenEllie How about NOT fucking the wildlife?
[0:58:29] <@lewdskeletor13> I needed that fast travel perk so I took it

[1:00:16] <%Kiiper> lose 2 attributes for one perk, not worth it at all

[1:00:46] <NeroInfinite> Yeah.
[1:00:48] <%Niney_Who> Plasma FUCKS
[1:00:51] <Gruhunchously> "What do they eat?"
[1:00:58] <flyingavocad0s> @pyr0_fr0st Yes
[1:00:59] <@commanderclaw> It does plasma damage, cause most guys have just standard physical resist
[1:01:01] <%Dr_Mooose> plasma hurts so
[1:01:02] <%ape_hawk> they eat SALTUNA
[1:01:02] <Gruhunchously> The question that separates Bethesda and Obsidian
[1:01:03] <%Kataguro> And goes through armor
[1:01:03] <aeonicvector> and Slag for EVERYTHING
[1:01:05] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat N Ray is poison that ignores armor
[1:01:06] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AngriestPat Plasma is super good on living things, shock is super for Robots.
[1:01:06] <%Marpolo13> yum
[1:01:11] <$OranHexthief> no pat corrosive is corrosive silly LUL
[1:01:11] <%dekkitout> N-ray is more like slag
[1:01:12] <%TheStarvingGood> @AngriestPat check codex for damage types
[1:01:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> Plasma cucked me with the rocks
[1:01:15] <%Jaxnos> i was already below average intelligence, biggest best choice ever for flaw
[1:01:16] <TyrantBelial> is Blad on stik good for parvati?
[1:01:21] <+Lost_Zombie> It's also a triple shot
[1:01:22] <%NovaKnightmare> N-ray sounds like a fucking meme
[1:01:27] <Ando_is_dabes> N-word is strong against blizzard armour
[1:01:27] <krymzen5> Clap
[1:01:31] <Monkeyweed21> N-ray is slash damage
[1:01:40] <@lewdskeletor13> The women and the children

[1:01:50] <%deviljhojho_> im so glad we finally got new vegas 2
[1:01:52] <mang0_fan> Pat is the weakest streamer since he can't say the n word
[1:01:52] <NeroInfinite> N-ray is bleed
[1:01:55] <Gruhunchously> Make sure you have N-ray privileges
[1:01:56] <%NovaKnightmare> Woolie said its ok to use the N ray to fight Tyranny
[1:01:57] <%ChaosVulpes> N-word only makes Woolie stronger while sapping Pat of strength...
[1:01:58] <deafmutelaughing> Newer Vegas
[1:02:00] <%deviljhojho_> i would cry if i wasnt dead inside

[1:02:10] <grayjammer> Blind
[1:02:10] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat there are grenade launchers in this game

[1:02:21] <Gruhunchously> This is a BLIND Let's Play
[1:02:25] <WarchiefGoldva> That guy got fucked.
[1:02:28] <aeonicvector> N-Ray triggers slash, but only on shotguns >100%, so just run corrosive viral void puncture condition overload
[1:02:29] <deafmutelaughing> not an enemy any more!
[1:02:31] <%Niney_Who> Missed Maglocks, big blind
[1:02:48] <%Kataguro> Good
[1:02:48] <krymzen5> i really like the variety in environments in this. really beats fallouts aesthetic for me
[1:02:51] <+Burritomoose> cum
[1:02:52] <nawadap136> B L I N D
[1:02:53] <%patriotrenegade> the stream disability is real
[1:03:22] <%ChaosVulpes> Pat would be a good cop. "Hey he can't shoot! Time to shoot him in the head now!"
[1:03:23] <%bread_assassin> I got me a shock cannon in this, and bow howdy am I in love with it.
[1:03:26] <Gruhunchously> THat was always a problem with VATS
[1:03:37] <+Xalgar> OR you could just kill them faster :)
[1:03:37] <Gruhunchously> Usually there was no reason not to go for headshots
[1:03:38] <%Dr_Mooose> only kneecaps
[1:03:45] <%tri3dgE027> This game kinda reminds me of Rust
[1:03:48] <KasiCrafter> Assault Rifle?
[1:03:51] <WarchiefGoldva> I love how there's a reason why you'd shoot them in other bits now.
[1:03:58] <@lewdskeletor13> Shoot their elbows so they suffer longer
[1:04:04] <WarchiefGoldva> Vats was cool but it was a headshot simulator.
[1:04:14] <Monkeyweed21> its weird how Pat ALWAYS disarms enemies with darker skin
[1:04:23] <%ChaosVulpes> But can I still shoot a rat in the groin???
[1:04:25] <aeonicvector> Question cause dumb meme.... do Crotchshots work? i want to RP as Triceracop in this now
[1:04:32] <%Niney_Who> Yes Pat, Smart
[1:04:38] <deafmutelaughing> oh god if you got shot in the elbows it would be like eternal funny bone pain
[1:04:39] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Good calll Pat!
[1:04:40] <Gruhunchously> Pat Smart
[1:04:40] <redrins> I'm amazed how you came up with that idea all by yourself
[1:04:40] <GarbageQueenEllie> shoot them in the nose so they can't smell you coming
[1:04:43] <%MelBrooksKA> smrt
[1:04:46] <TyrantBelial> Pat, S M R T.
[1:04:47] <+OkamiDude15> if someone puches your funny bone how do you even recover from that?
[1:04:47] <%Marpolo13> do companions need ammo?
[1:04:49] <@commanderclaw> Them doors, them doors, them space doors
[1:04:50] <LilMKatsu> I'm gad Pat thought of it Kappa
[1:04:51] <@lewdskeletor13> Them thar doors
[1:04:53] <TyrantBelial> Blad on Stik cut some letters out of it
[1:04:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> In Rifts, we would shoot the arms because they had the least armour and would still kill dudes. We left a trail of one armed corpses behind us.
[1:05:07] <prophetjo> big lie
[1:05:10] <WarchiefGoldva> Shoot them in the feet so they can't flee.
[1:05:10] <Gruhunchously> More games should take elbow shots into account, because that shit would hurt.
[1:05:13] <%Run44forrest> shoot them in the finger so they cant finger you
[1:05:18] <basswizard11> theres stuff, EVERYWHERE and your missing it all
[1:05:29] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s fine
[1:05:36] <@commanderclaw> I miss Fallout 1's groin shots
[1:05:36] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s his first run through
[1:05:37] <%ThatOneGameTester> depends on the angle
[1:05:40] <krymzen5> broke my elbow and it was hell
[1:05:40] <aeonicvector> Shoot them in the eyelash so they get more debris in there and go blind in like 20 years
[1:05:40] <ScreamLord> Or the hand
[1:05:40] <basswizard11> noooooo
[1:05:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> Nah man just shoot with your foot
[1:05:43] <%Niney_Who> b l i n d
[1:05:44] <1matheuw> big blind
[1:05:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I broke my same elbow twice, now I can't throw stuff straight
[1:05:46] <deafmutelaughing> if I was coming at someone and they shot me in the elbow I'd instantly surrender
[1:05:50] <+AllenDeadman> you can't shoot if your arms were blown off
[1:05:51] <%Ascethetic> its in front of you
[1:05:51] <%Doruben> om the forklift
[1:05:53] <%miguelrod777> shoot them in the dick
[1:05:53] <aeonicvector> but yeah do groinshots work in this?
[1:05:54] <Fujiwara_92> BLIND
[1:05:55] <LozsCat> Blindest
[1:05:56] <+Umbrul> the early fallout crit tables were silly, and amazing
[1:05:58] <%ChaosVulpes> Shoot off all their fingers and they can't use a gun anymore.
[1:05:58] <+OkamiDude15> thats just life nkoShrug
[1:05:59] <+Pomer> @Valentinius_Anodyne can u throw it sideways?
[1:06:02] <%Ascethetic> go back
[1:06:03] <%Marpolo13> lirikBLIND
[1:06:10] <NeroInfinite> PAt really needs the auto collection perk
[1:06:10] <%Niney_Who> The vending machine must be hiding
[1:06:15] <%valkuma> if you get shot in the elbow you probably are never using that arm for anything other than Handwriting ever again in your life
[1:06:16] <+sourceofall> get the armor mod and the perk taht increase the highlight range
[1:06:17] <+Pomer> i would just try to throw sideways instead. rip but i'm different
[1:06:19] <Monkeyweed21> Pat is blind from all the Cumbo in his eyes
[1:06:25] <NeroInfinite> BLIND
[1:06:26] <etnoika> For real tough, if you remove a person's thumbs they can never use a gun again.
[1:06:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Pomer That's pretty much what I have to do if I go bowling

[1:06:58] <yuribo26> If I didn't knew this was outer worlds and bethesda was shit, I could swear this was just Fallout
[1:06:58] <@lewdskeletor13> His hack is high enough to sell to vending machines
[1:07:01] <+sourceofall> he hacked it, but that begs the question of why can't just take all the money

[1:18:59] <%TheTakkster> The game uses fallout NV's armor system, so rifles will always 100% be the best weapons in the game
[1:19:03] <%RubberFistFight> @Gruhunchously yeah, it's like Voldemort. If you say the game name, it summons Todd Howard.
[1:19:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> Now we Goldeneye

[1:21:00] <%ape_hawk> i really hope microsoft gives obsidian even more money despite all the steam-babies whining about the epic games store
[1:21:03] <%floralkami> @GarbageQueenEllie i hope your trash pile stays comfy!
[1:21:03] <Monkeyweed21> Tech

[1:21:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> Oh wow your tech skills need love.
[1:21:31] <Gruhunchously> Blizzcon is going to be SO awkward and I'm living for it.
[1:21:33] <@lewdskeletor13> I haven’t even beaten the game and I already want DLC
[1:21:45] <%ChaosVulpes> Blizzcon is going to be the most wonderful shitshow of the season... :3
[1:21:47] <+b1zarr013> @ChaosVulpes I am. Its gonna be such the shit show. I can't wait
[1:21:53] <WarchiefGoldva> Blizzcon is gonna be a mix of nightmare horror and a beautiful thing.
[1:21:58] <%ape_hawk> i want The Outer Worlds 2 and The Outer Worlds: Tactics
[1:21:59] <%floralkami> @rumtumtugnutz unfortunately, elmo only killed an extension of the Cage entanglement
[1:22:10] <TyrantBelial> And I hear you can have multiple companions at once and that's nuts
[1:22:10] <Finakala> Blizzcon is going to be a mess and it'll be fun to watch
[1:22:14] <%Run44forrest> Mr.Ouch?
[1:22:17] <trashcansan> Outerer Worlds
[1:22:23] <tigerfang86> the GOBBOLINS

[1:22:30] <grayjammer> ENCUMHAZARD
[1:22:30] <tigerfang86> GOBBOLINS MAKE YOU HEAVY
[1:22:30] <Gruhunchously> @ape_hawk And then Bethesda takes over the IP and makes Outer World 3

[1:23:56] <%SilvaChariot0133> rip
[1:24:03] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 24m.
[1:24:19] <%dekkitout> Mantiqueen's a strong name
[1:24:27] <Tucker0603> man fucking a mantiqueen? i respect that
[1:24:36] <%ChaosVulpes> Pat on Twitch while I play Digimon Cybersleuth on my Switch... truly what an age to be alive!
[1:24:37] <Gruhunchously> Mantiqueen sounds like something I would choose as a username.
[1:25:00] <Monkeyweed21> BLIND
[1:25:03] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat So When are we starting the Fire?
[1:25:08] <+Estuko> FeelsBirthdayMan spent 30 min in VrChat with a friend and successful made progress over my fear of crowds lifes going pretty okay
[1:25:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> Nose drugs. Nose drugs for plague man. Doot doot doo
[1:25:10] <+Nenatab> At least you are not charged for every time you open a door.
[1:25:14] <Fujiwara_92> Blindness
[1:25:18] <Gruhunchously> It was always burning since the worlds been turning.
[1:25:21] <sniffy77> is it a giant mantis or a manticore?
[1:25:26] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat what was thst story you told of the hot sauce pizza
[1:25:27] <+OkamiDude15> TAKE a Look at THIS
[1:25:28] <deafmutelaughing> it's the giant rat that makes all of the rules
[1:25:37] <%Niney_Who> Look at this dumb armor
[1:25:38] <Bionicghost> What do you think of it?
[1:25:43] <%Run44forrest> is there a 3rd person mode
[1:25:44] <+DesmondtheOrc> Hey Pat how's New Spacegas? Also Twitch has no concept of timing because this is like the 10th Overwatch ad I've gotten since the Blizzard fiasco
[1:25:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> Taste The Freedom? That's Spacer's Choice free range jizz in your rations.
[1:25:46] <tigerfang86> Da rules*
[1:25:50] <%NovaKnightmare> that armor is so overtly flamboyant
[1:25:55] <%Piemen99> ????????
[1:25:55] <+OkamiDude15> its REALLY Powerful
[1:26:01] <%Piemen99> I was banned?
[1:26:07] <%RubberFistFight> oh nooooo
[1:26:08] <TheTunnelSn8ke> That armor is a 90s-patterned beverage cup
[1:26:08] <Monkeyweed21> their weight is nothing
[1:26:09] <Gruhunchously> Especially against living things
[1:26:10] <%Piemen99> Im sorry
[1:26:14] <%Run44forrest> just eat it?
[1:26:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> Too infinity.... And Beyond, bitches!
[1:26:19] <%dalmek> alright, time to sleep. Goodnight and have a great stream y'all
[1:26:21] <deafmutelaughing> time to drink up!
[1:26:23] <+gutlesscoward> eat all the food to make yourself lighter
[1:26:31] <Monkeyweed21> pat they weight almost nothing
[1:26:32] <%ChaosVulpes> Why must weight be a thing in my RPGs? I want to carry unlimited items like the psycho murder hobo hoarder that I am.
[1:26:34] <+gutlesscoward> just like in real life
[1:26:34] <Fujiwara_92> EAT IT
[1:26:42] <%Jaxnos> the weight hasn't gone down LUL
[1:26:43] <@commanderclaw> Keep the alcohol, you can use it to boost charm even further
[1:26:44] <deafmutelaughing> pat you're not losing any weight
[1:26:49] <Bionicghost> DEVOUR HOUR
[1:26:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> So many buff items wasted in the prime of their shelf life
[1:26:56] <Frog_of_Justic> Break down useless weapons and armor
[1:27:01] <%dekkitout> Boo, drugz r gr8
[1:27:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> its the guns you gotta ditch man
[1:27:04] <wondersloth07> please pat its not tuna it's "tuna"
[1:27:08] <%BreakingRatchet> pat theyre less than one
[1:27:10] <Monkeyweed21> pat they weigh almost nothing
[1:27:19] <Gruhunchously> I think food should spoil if it stays in your inventory too long. Like MGS 3.
[1:27:20] <%BreakingRatchet> this will lose you like 10 at most
[1:27:21] <deafmutelaughing> oooh I see
[1:27:21] <IndoorSitup> Has Pat been informed about the Quantum Ranger yet?
[1:27:25] <WarchiefGoldva> I love drugs, they help me escape.
[1:27:27] <StromkoPenguin> He has a lot of it, fractions of a pound add up
[1:27:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> You had tea there that said the flavor was purple.
[1:27:49] <tigerfang86> HUGE JUNK DROP
[1:27:51] <Frog_of_Justic> Break down useless weapons and armor
[1:27:52] <%dekkitout> @IndoorSitup I'll hazard a guess from the name alone that it's Mysterious Stranger?
[1:28:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> SELL SOME GUNS
[1:28:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> You'll get more
[1:28:14] <tigerfang86> he just did
[1:28:17] <IndoorSitup> @dekkitout No I mean from Power Rangers BFTG
[1:28:17] <Gruhunchously> Love a good corporate jingle.
[1:28:20] <%ChaosVulpes> Isn't it sad that the last decent Bethesda game was Skyrim? They just can't seem to stop themselves from burning all the goodwill they built up...
[1:28:32] <Finakala> Skyrim wasn't really decent
[1:28:32] <Gruhunchously> Fallout 4 was okay
[1:28:37] <%dekkitout> Oh you mean Vergil Ranger
[1:28:38] <%BreakingRatchet> crazy talk
[1:28:38] <StromkoPenguin> Just hope it's not the 'tuna' canned on this colony.
[1:28:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> Huffing tuna is a weird choice
[1:28:43] <BurningWigEmissary> are all the merchants spacers choice or do we see more companies later
[1:28:44] <%3Xgilly> apatCrazy apatCrazyhead
[1:28:56] <tigerfang86> you CRUSHED HIS SKULL parvati
[1:28:59] <+Estuko> That felt kinda funky lol
[1:29:00] <Gruhunchously> Aw, she's adorable.
[1:29:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> @StromkoPenguin It is.
[1:29:00] <%king_wragles> she's so nice to the people she kills
[1:29:02] <%ChaosVulpes> Is Pat's companion just Lady Thor or something with that lightning hammer?
[1:29:04] <%Piemen99> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[1:29:10] <TyrantBelial> I'm gonna mention one thing that is super important.
[1:29:12] <IndoorSitup> @angriestpat Have you seen the trailer for the Quantum Ranger in Power Rangers BFTG? You might like it.
[1:29:16] <TyrantBelial> The general mook human enemies
[1:29:17] <%Run44forrest> no pat
[1:29:17] <@lewdskeletor13> She’s basically Thor
[1:29:18] <TyrantBelial> look good.
[1:29:25] <%VanaSkiller> saw nothin
[1:29:27] <+Ominnous> rooAYAYA
[1:29:28] <TyrantBelial> they look arguably cool
[1:29:28] <BurningWigEmissary> mah her new name is thighs thunderosa
[1:29:31] <mayorrev> awww
[1:29:33] <hntronium> cant have feelings when you're dead
[1:29:34] <mayorrev> lil critter
[1:29:50] <%dekkitout> Dai Shi looked kickass, and it sucks that he's probably the least known in BFTG
[1:30:01] <Junkles> pieHELLO
[1:30:01] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[1:30:05] <Gruhunchously> ???
[1:30:08] <%ChaosVulpes> This seems oddly similar to my usual 'sneaky stealth archer' build from Skyrim... just with guns. :3
[1:30:21] <Gruhunchously> This building has Bioshock vibes.
[1:30:35] <IndoorSitup> @chaosvulpes You mean the character that everyone plays in Bethesda games?
[1:30:59] <deafmutelaughing> """"proud""""
[1:31:11] <%AgentOrangeShoes> HaRdWoRkInG sPiRiT
[1:31:14] <%dekkitout> I smell a boss fight
[1:31:22] <%ChaosVulpes> @IndoorSitup Yes. Except the one time I built a boxer Khajit with heavy armor. Fun times suplexing enemies to death and punching dragons. :3
[1:31:25] <deafmutelaughing> LMAO that's what they wanted the mantiqueen for, extremely fitting
[1:31:29] <+MrN64> oh my god Quantum Ranger's grid trailer is amazing
[1:31:32] <%SilvaChariot0133> They hunt in packs huh?
[1:31:34] <%miguelrod777> what do you mean definitely not foreshadowing a boss fight
[1:31:41] <IndoorSitup> Can I post a link?
[1:31:44] <IndoorSitup> ***
[1:31:48] <IndoorSitup> damb
[1:31:51] <IndoorSitup> damn

[1:32:06] <OhHowNice> Wolves hunt in packs arisen
[1:32:13] <Finakala> It hates fire!
[1:32:14] <nawadap136> Wolves hunt in packs Arisen
[1:32:16] <ミュウレ4242> not as easy as cystypigs.
[1:32:18] <Gruhunchously> He dissapeared
[1:32:28] <WarchiefGoldva> Wolves hunt in packs Arisen.
[1:32:31] <Ner234> I'm surprised it's ACTUAL fish
[1:32:33] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I'd like to point out that it makes NO fucking sense that Power Armor would effect your Mind Skills
[1:32:33] <%crimsonharvest> it makes the game really easy
[1:32:35] <Frog_of_Justic> Shame that they are not putting Saltuna in the cans but those gremlin things
[1:32:39] <@lewdskeletor13> Parvati enjoys violence a little too much
[1:32:39] <%ape_hawk> yeah, companions are great overall
[1:32:41] <%Piemen99> [STAND]
[1:32:48] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat Sure but BOONE
[1:32:49] <%king_wragles> @Ner234 right?

[1:32:57] <%Run44forrest> whaaat its not SALTUNA?
[1:33:02] <Junkles> you'll be glad to have that guide
[1:33:06] <Gruhunchously> That's good to hear. Companions are usually my favorite part of games like this.
[1:33:07] <IndoorSitup> Well if anyone is interested you should look up the trailer for the Quantum Ranger in Power Rangers BFTG. It'll definetly MOTIVATE you.

[1:35:07] <ミュウレ4242> you will never hug a lion.
[1:35:09] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat btw you can have 2 companions in this game so it's a proper RPG party
[1:35:09] <IndoorSitup> I'm gonna peace out for a bit. Can someone inform Pat about the Quantum Ranger trailer for Power Rangers BFTG when there's some downtime?
[1:35:09] <SubjectX07x> That boi got one big ass intestine.
[1:35:14] <%Ebonyglow> Ebonyglow subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 9 month streak! Hey Pat, this game is amazing! It doesn't feel like a game we would've gotten nowadays, but I love it. Enjoy!

[1:40:19] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat you can talk to them and if you give the medicine to the girl they'll respond to it
[1:40:21] <%Niney_Who> Why wouldn't you be able to

[1:42:51] <@lewdskeletor13> The sprats got out, that’s what they were killing
[1:42:55] <IndoorSitup> Is this the type of game where you can play a psycho murderer that kills everyone they see?
[1:42:59] <%ChaosVulpes> Why not loot the dead? They don't need it anymore...
[1:43:00] <%ape_hawk> yes
[1:43:03] <Parapattern> Just shoot out the door ever once in a while to let everyone know who's boss
[1:43:08] <%GarbageNirvana> @IndoorSitup I have been told yes
[1:43:09] <@lewdskeletor13> @indoorsitup Yes. Only one character can’t be killed
[1:43:11] <%Dr_Mooose> ok
[1:43:17] <Gruhunchously> Everyone is killable, so yes I guess.
[1:43:21] <hydroarsonist69> why loot the dead when you can buy from me ?
[1:43:22] <Frog_of_Justic> I bet people are getting sick from eating saltuna made from those critters
[1:43:28] <mayorrev> THE LAW

[1:43:47] <Parapattern> Less people to watch you steal Pat
[1:43:51] <%ape_hawk> actually the "plague" is really just the common flu
[1:43:54] <%ChaosVulpes> I love watching AI start to go nuts in games. :3

[1:44:10] <+Ablestron> @AngriestPat did you get to the part where you learn how the marauders are made? >_>
[1:44:11] <CrabSlacks> it was his ONE JOB to make sure those rats stayed inside, now he's fucked

[1:45:11] <tigerfang86> C H A R M
[1:45:20] <%crimsonharvest> so im pretty sure that part of the reason these people get sick is that the vast majority of their food is shitty company mass produced artificial shit
[1:45:21] <%ECRead> imagine wasting a 9mm or .45 on a rat
[1:45:21] <Gruhunchously> One problem with this game is that so far all the female NPCs have the same hair.
[1:45:22] <IndoorSitup> But smugglin' makes me feel good.
[1:45:28] <CrackerJack450> EMLO
[1:45:30] <%honeyman18> Ask the mayor about what's up

[1:47:39] <@commanderclaw> Elmo the slime snail cat
[1:47:43] <aeonicvector> and ofc, he earned the title elmo at the shelter for defeating all the previous elmos
[1:47:44] <%ElenaManetta> fun fact: you can change a cat's name without involving the law no one's gonna stop you
[1:47:45] <+twin_triggers> chicago has lots of shelters than need help
[1:47:46] <%umbypokochan> yeah but my cat was Mittens and i was like nah, he's Rigby now :P
[1:47:52] <mayorrev> Elmo was coated in piss when paige met him
[1:47:56] <+nekodelic> Where's Paige btw?
[1:47:57] <mayorrev> and he was like
[1:48:01] <mayorrev> "boooooo!"
[1:48:01] <Parapattern> The universe was shaped around Elmo to give him that name
[1:48:03] <%dekkitout> You're not gonna include the lore on Elmo's primordial piss slime

[1:48:28] <YellowDays> is there a day/night cycle in this game
[1:48:28] <%ape_hawk> shes in "pip pip cheerio" land?
[1:48:29] <Cherokia666> my only problem with the game so far is that I'm having trouble memorizing all the food and stuff and what they do. It's kind of a lot to keep track of
[1:48:29] <%Dr_Mooose> Lon-don?
[1:48:32] <+AllenDeadman> she's hanging out with the fae
[1:48:35] <%AgentOrangeShoes> Something something crumpets
[1:48:35] <@lewdskeletor13> @yellowdays Ye
[1:48:35] <mayorrev> elmo is such a blessed boy
[1:48:36] <%ElenaManetta> she spends so much money on travel, she went back to america and then took a break in london in the same time frame
[1:48:37] <Frostydough1> Elmo is from Chicago???? I cant't believe it, im from the same palce as emlo
[1:48:39] <%Shadicara> Oh she go to London Mcm? Good for her hope she has fun
[1:48:39] <%crimsonharvest> it raises gear level to player level
[1:48:40] <@commanderclaw> Tinker levels up your gun's level
[1:48:42] <dickbuttwoman> It's a stopgap.
[1:48:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Sounds good to me
[1:48:43] <+sourceofall> rapidly escalating amount of money
[1:48:44] <@lewdskeletor13> Tinker upgrades damage
[1:48:47] <%Run44forrest> she hanging with Clemps?
[1:48:48] <%ape_hawk> yeah, its titanite shards, dude
[1:48:48] <CherrieVelvet> number go up
[1:48:52] <%ElenaManetta> i'm spending weeks debating on spending money for one video game
[1:48:54] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat it increases the level that the item is scaled for
[1:48:55] <RyanTheRecluse> Tinker levels up the gun
[1:48:59] <@lewdskeletor13> I did it with the laser pistol a few times and it does big damage now
[1:49:00] <trashcansan> it's almost 4 bongs over in the uk
[1:49:05] <%FalseEyeD> apatPorgmo bawkGun CHICAGO
[1:49:11] <dickbuttwoman> It costs more each time. But if you find a level 15, it costs the same to upgrade it to 16 as upgrading a found level 1 to level 2
[1:49:19] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Turn off show base item stats, so itll show your dps with your skills @AngriestPat
[1:49:20] <mayorrev> look how happy elmo is!
[1:49:35] <%floralkami> @Gruhunchously like even in the beginning there was a soilder type with short mini-twists. Like actual 4c textured hair.
[1:49:37] <dickbuttwoman> @AngriestPat Only as a stopgap!
[1:49:40] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat it caps at 5 levels but it also keeps the base level and the higher you go the more it costs to level it
[1:49:41] <%tri3dgE027> Elmo looks like a gigantic Plush Toy xliceComfy
[1:49:42] <%dekkitout> Lookin at you, Borderlands...
[1:49:43] <SvenHolgersson> WHAT DICK DID THEY HAVE TO SUCK FOR ALL THESE GOOD FEATURES
[1:49:45] <Junkles> pieS
[1:49:45] <ミュウレ4242> a little higher than your level, actually.
[1:49:51] <+AllenDeadman> eat shit BL
[1:49:51] <mayorrev> ELMO IS HYPE
[1:49:53] <+Grayhammatter> yep

[1:50:01] <misha_kastrilevich> So... is this game good so far?
[1:50:05] <%ape_hawk> yes
[1:50:06] <%Shadicara> apatWink
[1:50:08] <%FalseEyeD> yes
[1:50:11] <@lewdskeletor13> The game is radical
[1:50:22] <RyanTheRecluse> @angriestpat the cost is extreme though, any it can only go 5 levels beyond your current level
