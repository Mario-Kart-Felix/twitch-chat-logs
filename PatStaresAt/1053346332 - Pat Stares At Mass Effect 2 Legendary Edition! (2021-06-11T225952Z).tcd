[0:18:37] <Dova573> if Basketball was made by Sakurai dribbling would have been patched out
[0:18:41] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Or how dunking happened
[0:18:41] <%spartanghost004> Pat please I am begging you stop bringing up who stupid humans are I have so little faith already
[0:18:42] <$hewlettfan96> Chad
[0:18:43] <peachy996> Not in my house
[0:18:48] <%BoxNavy> jesus
[0:18:48] <MrPandastic> I wish soccer would make the field smaller so it can actually be fun to watch.
[0:18:50] <+bulletzok> there also wasn't a Jumpshot
[0:18:53] <Pookiedaexzile> They still do that, the big guy just hast omove more
[0:18:56] <%JoshManVGH> I wonder how Hurling rules came about.
[0:18:57] <TomFrancis_> how do you know so much about basketball?
[0:19:01] <%dekkitout> And now the game is just a 3 point shootout to 100+ points
[0:19:03] <$LightningLynx89> It's George Mikan
[0:19:09] <+Ancopro> that feels like something from scrubqoutes
[0:19:10] <zerointelligence000> they had to patch the game
[0:19:12] <$LightningLynx89> The first inductee into the NBA Hall of Fame
[0:19:15] <%AzureGale> Hey man, nice shot
[0:19:16] <bob900000> john basketball
[0:19:19] <%NateyBeak> sports history with pat
[0:19:20] <%DianaTheAscian> I wish soccer was played in a 20X20 room
[0:19:27] <BarujaraciGaming> I believe that was Michael Jordan in the 80s
[0:19:27] <%Robot_Nixon_> The Mr. Shakedown of basketball
[0:19:29] <faintsmile> sports are fake
[0:19:30] <$Ziegsy> CHAT look what I got in the hype train the other day HypeCozy HES SO COZY
[0:19:32] <%JoshManVGH> Pat have you ever looked up irish hurling?
[0:19:33] <%Ipsenscastle> @MrPandastic that is a thing, people play 5 a side on mini pitches.
[0:19:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> SACRED GAMES MADE BY GOD
[0:19:40] <chimeraxmachina> Damn I’m glad I don’t care for sports..
[0:19:42] <skyentombment> Oh boy, Pat's gonna go into bloodsports again
[0:19:43] <Pookiedaexzile> and Then Wilt Chamberlin had sex with 1500 women and Micheal Jackson met the Looney Toones
[0:19:44] <the_krypto_knight> I thought wilt chamberlain was me goaltending?
[0:19:45] <%Nekros4442> Could you imagine if Hockey was still in the 80's and 90's era?
[0:19:48] <$LightningLynx89> Well 3 point line was an implementation of the ABA to make their league more different than the NBA
[0:19:49] <%CavemanInCave> pucks are now cubes
[0:19:49] <$hewlettfan96> Stream Roblox sometime
[0:19:51] <%Arancet> sounds like a lot of work to remake rinks
[0:19:53] <$StrawberryPantsu> MAKE THE SPORT BETTER THOUGH
[0:19:53] <%spartanghost004> yeah it is pretty bad also based solely on our weird ass need for rituals
[0:19:54] <peachy996> The SACRED RULES of hand egg
[0:19:55] <%dekkitout> Thats sounds pretty substantial and possibly expensive
[0:19:56] <BlackStarAura> Sports suck
[0:19:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> And the Lord said no 3 pointers
[0:19:59] <balthazar758> sports
[0:20:00] <Lamokmok> They're basically balance patches
[0:20:01] <TomFrancis_> they also shortened the nets
[0:20:05] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt they could have added more goals.
[0:20:06] <DatAsuna> Moba players when they see any map that isn't 3 lanes
[0:20:08] <MrPandastic> @Ipsenscastle yeah, I've seen that and it is a blast to watch as it's constant action.
[0:20:10] <%Nekros4442> NO HELMETS WHILE WE HAVE DAGGERS ON OUR FEET
[0:20:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> TRUE
[0:20:12] <%Robot_Nixon_> And alive people
[0:20:13] <%spartanghost004> stick hit puck on ice go burr
[0:20:14] <%knight1210> they are
[0:20:14] <faintsmile> dont they just get to fight during hockey
[0:20:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Football just took away hitting people in the head iwht your head
[0:20:16] <%Retinolgaming> Rugby is pats fave sport
[0:20:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> HELMETS R FOR PUSSIES
[0:20:18] <skyentombment> On the subject of hockey: FUCK THE LEAFS, GO HABS
[0:20:20] <+Gamblor69> Died to own the libs
[0:20:22] <CatRidder> is basketball the best cause is Canadian?
[0:20:27] <+OmegaWeltall> is it gay to NOT die?
[0:20:27] <%BoxNavy> die
[0:20:30] <$hewlettfan96> American baseball is dying isn’t it??
[0:20:30] <Meekest> What's a kilometer funny man
[0:20:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> But Pat I thought u wanted bloodsport
[0:20:31] <balthazar758> bloodsports
[0:20:38] <%bassoontyphoon> Go habs
[0:20:40] <%Dfreddy8> Or a skate slitting a throat.
[0:20:41] <%spartanghost004> Natural selection pat let it ride
[0:20:42] <chimeraxmachina> There’s already too many made up rules for real life why make games w even MORE nonsense rules
[0:20:42] <BarujaraciGaming> how much is a kilometer in miles.....
[0:20:47] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> isn't this what you want pat?
[0:20:49] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt in some sports helmets are more dangerous apparently
[0:20:50] <%Ranryu692> his name was Casey Jones @patstaresat
[0:20:56] <TomFrancis_> someone had their throat cut open on a skate
[0:20:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @hewlettfan96 Dying? its been dead LUK
[0:20:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> @omegaweltall Yes. GigaChad
[0:21:00] <skyentombment> @BarujaraciGaming 1 mile is 1.6 kms
[0:21:01] <fluffy_sauce> Jacques Plante!
[0:21:02] <%HairballCT> @BarujaraciGaming less than 1
[0:21:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Baseball just reveled they have a ball foreign substance problem
[0:21:03] <Profmcstevie> oh FUCK being a goalie without face coverings
[0:21:05] <+CookieCutter007> if they die they die
[0:21:06] <CatRidder> head injuries are not real pat
[0:21:07] <+RowenCleric> why does pat sound drunk
[0:21:10] <$LightningLynx89> @hewlettfan96 Doesn't help they respond poorly to any scandal that comes their way.
[0:21:17] <%Jekado> not dying is fun?
[0:21:18] <$lumporr> he probably felt REAL stupid the second time
[0:21:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> Only pussies want to avoid fatal injuries and brain damage woolieFABRICATION
[0:21:19] <BarujaraciGaming> thank you @skyentombment
[0:21:19] <%shurtal> Jacques Plante
[0:21:23] <$LightningLynx89> But yeah Baseball is basically dead at this point.
[0:21:24] <HaroldDonchee> being a goalie without a mask sounds fucking terrifying
[0:21:36] <%Varlinator> Was his name Jacques "Le Cock" Grande?
[0:21:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BUT BLOOSPORT PAT
[0:21:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Yup
[0:21:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> Imagine fearing stupids deaths Kappa
[0:21:39] <%PocketBearIllustrator> just throwing this out there, but American football is Rugby for wusses.
[0:21:41] <%bassoontyphoon> @patstaresat speaking if heritage moments have you seen the newer ones? Wayyyyy more somber
[0:21:42] <%DianaTheAscian> are pucks heavy?
[0:21:42] <%dekkitout> 💯
[0:21:42] <+CookieCutter007> Rugby bby
[0:21:43] <$LightningLynx89> Well that's just Rugby
[0:21:44] <%TheotherKristian> Rugby vs football
[0:21:44] <%NateyBeak> yea rugby rules
[0:21:44] <%Ranryu692> yeah, football helmets are just weapons
[0:21:45] <%valriot> So Rugby
[0:21:50] <BarujaraciGaming> @skyentombment I'm from hamburger land in the weed/tech province so I'm dumb
[0:21:50] <jumpyhugs> Rugby FTW
[0:21:50] <$hewlettfan96> @ballerswagbro9k How do I’m a Britfag so I know no history on the sport
[0:21:52] <@SoFarFetched> also the fact that the helmets protect your head BUT make internal brain damage more likely
[0:21:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> BRING BACK GLADIATOR GAMES
[0:21:54] <%MidnightBurst12> same idea behind bare knuckle boxing
[0:21:56] <stantheman_97> bring back bloodsports tbh
[0:21:56] <MoonKing> same principle as boxing
[0:21:57] <chimeraxmachina> You know what’s great about basketball? It’s not football
[0:21:58] <%Nekros4442> Goalies should be the most payed people in Hockey simply for fucking hazard pay
[0:21:59] <%JamesCorck> Rugby's great.
[0:21:59] <%Ipsenscastle> just cut out the middleman and go back to feeding Christians to lions
[0:22:02] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Same with Boxing
[0:22:03] <TomFrancis_> and foot blades
[0:22:04] <Profmcstevie> Boxing without gloves had less deaths and serious injuries cos punching faces barehanded hurts a lot
[0:22:05] <%Monkeyweed21> the armor provides bonus damage
[0:22:07] <%Avalon_One> And open socially accepted brawls
[0:22:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> And the occasional blade to the neck
[0:22:09] <the_krypto_knight> With all the armor people just use themselves as fucking missiles
[0:22:09] <+redthebaron> also the helmet is pretty much a weapon
[0:22:09] <@SoFarFetched> football   you worry more about brain damage geefNLT
[0:22:11] <balthazar758> "until it's done"
[0:22:11] <$MetalPanic> Pat why does your stream always start with a Rogaine ad?
[0:22:12] <$SGrim> BLOODSPORTS BIT
[0:22:14] <%JamesCorck> XD
[0:22:14] <%BoxNavy> just kill
[0:22:15] <%justnathan18> I broke my fucking nose in 4 places playing Rugby as a teen. I have a new nose now.

[0:22:21] <%Varlinator> No more YouTubers
[0:22:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FIGHT FOREVER?
[0:22:21] <%Ranryu692> @patstaresat watch Megalobox
[0:22:23] <$lumporr> put helmets on the boxers
[0:22:24] <%ssjklyco> This has been Bloodsport hour with Pat
[0:22:24] <JustYudha> uh ph

[0:22:25] <viewtifulr> you mean JUST GO
[0:22:26] <bob900000> gun
[0:22:27] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah no
[0:22:27] <%JamesCorck> Fight til someone dies.
[0:22:28] <AluxStreams> Boxing, but you get a free hit if you can catch the Smash Ball.
[0:22:29] <+yoshkosh20> can we wrap our gloves in barbed wire?
[0:22:29] <$StrawberryPantsu> THATS JUST BLOODSPORT
[0:22:29] <%Ipsenscastle> 'no rounds, only death'
[0:22:31] <%dirkfunk1> 3 stock
[0:22:31] <HaroldDonchee> no rounds. no court. just fight in the street
[0:22:31] <%valriot> One Round, No Timer
[0:22:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait let him finish
[0:22:32] <%vivaldiva> pat's lust for bloodsport continues
[0:22:32] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Should we allow drug usage in sports?
[0:22:33] <T_Sasquatch> just no rounds LUL
[0:22:33] <%crazyspartan214> but Pat they will die
[0:22:34] <absentking> bloodsport got it
[0:22:34] <fairore> bro what
[0:22:37] <%Garthunox> FIGHT FOREVER!
[0:22:37] <%Varlinator> It's over until KO
[0:22:38] <vVAstrAVv> i wonder if its bloodsports again
[0:22:39] <$lumporr> you get 20 MINUTES. GO.
[0:22:39] <faintsmile> that would be awful
[0:22:40] <+CookieCutter007> LUL
[0:22:40] <fiddlestef> they would get tired so quick
[0:22:41] <$StrawberryPantsu> YOUR GUNNA SAY NO GLOVES NEXT
[0:22:42] <Pookiedaexzile> So if someone stops?
[0:22:43] <%Garthunox> FIGHT FOREVER!!!
[0:22:43] <$LightningLynx89> Bloodsport okay
[0:22:43] <%Nekros4442> 12 rounds is alot more punishment than 1 round with a knockout
[0:22:43] <fiddlestef> nothing would happen
[0:22:44] <+StoopKid241> holy shit
[0:22:44] <zerointelligence000> MK theme plays
[0:22:45] <%AncelDeLambert> enjoy the match being over five minutes in as each boxer is gasping for air
[0:22:46] <skyentombment> @BarujaraciGaming I understand, dw, knowing both is useful for big good communimacating with our cousins from up north
[0:22:46] <fiddlestef> thats boring
[0:22:46] <stantheman_97> just go until someone drops dead
[0:22:47] <%Nekros4442> I'd think
[0:22:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> If they die they die
[0:22:47] <%Avalon_One> 35 minutes of pure carnage
[0:22:47] <chimeraxmachina> Boxing: final kill edition
[0:22:48] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Actual death
[0:22:49] <%dekkitout> Rule #1: Stop when a body hits the floor
[0:22:49] <%blastazoid00> UNTIL ITS DONE
[0:22:50] <peachy996> Honestly it's 2021, I think we're owed some futuristic bloodsports
[0:22:50] <Pookiedaexzile> So both Fighters will just agree to have rounds
[0:22:50] <%ssjklyco> Isnt that Wrestling?
[0:22:53] <$LightningLynx89> Guys, take a guess if it's Bloodsports or not
[0:22:53] <bob900000> is killing your opponent ok?
[0:22:54] <faintsmile> 15 mins of dudes standing there panting
[0:22:55] <%valriot> Cross Tekken
[0:22:55] <Pookiedaexzile> What about Cut men
[0:22:58] <%UvBenServed> 34 minutes of hugging

[0:23:01] <T_Sasquatch> THERE IT IS
[0:23:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> AND SHARKS
[0:23:05] <Sol_Install> wat
[0:23:05] <vVAstrAVv> just shank eachother
[0:23:05] <+CookieCutter007> LUL giving Mayweather even more a advantage
[0:23:06] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt what is its 3 rounds and on round 3 the throw knives in the ring?
[0:23:06] <iosephe> The ropes are electrified
[0:23:09] <DatAsuna> let moe used the barbed glove
[0:23:10] <%Robot_Nixon_> atpRtsd3 atpRtsd4
[0:23:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> THATSBWHAT I WANT
[0:23:11] <Sol_Install> What did i just come into???
[0:23:11] <%thedankestmeeme> do you have the PC GGS?
[0:23:11] <fairore> no clinching
[0:23:11] <%UvBenServed> ZAPPING SYSTEM
[0:23:13] <Pookiedaexzile> You do realize Boxers will just take longer breaks right
[0:23:13] <Dova573> I get ya, but how about keep the rounds but the last is a sudden death round until someone gets knocked down
[0:23:14] <%NateyBeak> DEFRIBULATOR BOXING
[0:23:15] <+Ghufufin> quick write that down
[0:23:17] <%MidnightBurst12> sounds reasonable
[0:23:19] <Oak_bogle> New rule for streaming. No parts. One go.
[0:23:21] <%crazyspartan214> Pat it's not Gladiator
[0:23:23] <Pookiedaexzile> they only get 30 seconds
[0:23:24] <@SoFarFetched> BLOODBOWL?
[0:23:24] <Profmcstevie> By god the audience has STOLEN a rod!
[0:23:25] <Link232> The cattle prod should 100% be part of boxing gonna be honest
[0:23:25] <SovPho> we call it "Kinking"
[0:23:26] <%dekkitout> Would that make fighting games better 🤔
[0:23:26] <AluxStreams> There's only one gumshield and you have to fight for it.
[0:23:26] <stantheman_97> after 10 minutes someone gets shot at random
[0:23:26] <%lockhead45> Surround the ring with Hippos instead
[0:23:28] <chimeraxmachina> Boxing but they are blindfolded...trust me
[0:23:29] <%DianaTheAscian> IS THAT THE ZAPPING SYSTEM PAT
[0:23:29] <%BoxNavy> one day you will get dieball
[0:23:30] <%Jekado> Pat look up Taser Ball!
[0:23:30] <T_Sasquatch> Just make a game of it you nerd
[0:23:35] <%Monkeyweed21> PLAY BLOODBOWL 2
[0:23:37] <BarujaraciGaming> and water is actually vodka, and the ropes are chicken wire
[0:23:37] <skyentombment> NAUMACHY
[0:23:38] <Sol_Install> Pat that's just football
[0:23:38] <$lumporr> GOOD?
[0:23:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> It does Rules
[0:23:41] <%thedankestmeeme> i thouguht viking ing
[0:23:43] <$LightningLynx89> Gladiators weren't even a Bloodsport
[0:23:44] <$SGrim> Curse you, human decency! I want carnage on cable!
[0:23:44] <skyentombment> GET A BUNCH OF BOATS TO FIGHT
[0:23:44] <+yoshkosh20> sometimes there's surprises in the form of weapons thrown into the ring.
[0:23:45] <stantheman_97> you're right and you should say it
[0:23:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> FOR THOSE WHO ARE ABOUT TO DIE
[0:23:46] <+redthebaron> bread and circus baby
[0:23:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> not for the gladiators LUL
[0:23:48] <$hewlettfan96> Blood bowl sounds abysmal
[0:23:50] <%Jekado> Taser ball is a "real" sport
[0:23:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> BRING BACK TIGERS AND LIONS
[0:23:51] <%justcallmebobplease> Taser Ball seems made for pat's viewing
[0:23:53] <%thedankestmeeme> or pirateing ing
[0:23:54] <%Varlinator> ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!
[0:23:55] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Ok no but I really did want mayweather to just punch Paul’s face off like in Plagues punch-out cartoon
[0:23:55] <%Avalon_One> Don't worry once the crocs eat the hockey players, they'll simply freeze to death on the ice before they can get to the crowd
[0:23:55] <@SoFarFetched> " geefDense this isn't a bloodsport I wanted"
[0:23:57] <$LightningLynx89> Gladiator fights typically ended at the first draw of blood
[0:24:02] <%DianaTheAscian> BOAT BATTLES AS A SPORT
[0:24:03] <madpuppy2424> Gladiator is fucking lame
[0:24:04] <Pookiedaexzile> I think Pat Loves Football
[0:24:08] <chimeraxmachina> Gladatoring
[0:24:09] <Pookiedaexzile> At least the highlights
[0:24:16] <balthazar758> emperor patus
[0:24:16] <vVAstrAVv> when the boxers get into the ring the crowd pulls out their guns and shoots them both dead. there, boxing
[0:24:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> George Foreman vs a Siberian toger
[0:24:19] <%BigCoffee> people should take drugs at the olympics ffs

[0:32:54] <%tank7013> Is that why they're all bad?
[0:32:55] <DefaultSettiings> Shakespeare legit owed everybody five dollars
[0:32:55] <stfnotguilty> Speaking of iambic pentameter, I'm currently in training to be a pro wrestler, and I'm planning on having an insufferable Shakespearean actor gimmick. The current name I'm going with is the No Holds Bard.
[0:32:55] <+Alopekis> I'll 1v1 Shakespeare right now.
[0:32:56] <%doctordinkus> iambic pentameter is measured in feet
[0:32:57] <%AzureGale> THEY DED
[0:32:59] <Jolly_Adventurer> That's Bullshit, but I believe it
[0:33:00] <%shadowace2400> sounds like Shakespeare
[0:33:02] <peachy996> Maybe 5 if you wanna take a trip to the Citadel
[0:33:09] <Kindred_808> All of them
[0:33:10] <%blastyoboots> iambic pentameter goes baDA baDA baDA baDA baDA and yes that's five but fight me, fight me AND shakespeare
[0:33:14] <zerointelligence000> Shakespeare may or may not have been high while writing his plays
[0:33:14] <%Avalon_One> They're all dead, I killed them, the children too. I HATE THEM!
[0:33:14] <%octavian_wolf> woo! made it just in time
[0:33:15] <%Garthunox> shakespeare was a hack
[0:33:15] <PirateMike_> Snort his dust
[0:33:16] <%justnathan18> Wasnt Shakespere like 10 dudes
[0:33:16] <iosephe> so you're a coward
[0:33:17] <satans_finest_millennial> unless it comedy then its "they fuck"
[0:33:18] <PirateMike_> to show dominance
[0:33:19] <%condemned_15> The end
[0:33:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DOESNT MATTER SUPPLEX THAT BITCH
[0:33:19] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Didnt they fight for his corpse?
[0:33:20] <+Alopekis> Sounds like an easy fight
[0:33:20] <chimeraxmachina> Oh neat I learned something
[0:33:20] <wolverinewaswrong> my money's on the cloud
[0:33:20] <Pookiedaexzile> pussy
[0:33:20] <%DianaTheAscian> I would fight shakespear
[0:33:22] <Louie_Salmon> I would lose to a cloud
[0:33:22] <faintsmile> so shakespeare would win
[0:33:23] <AluxStreams> Shakespeare is too powerful now.
[0:33:23] <%BoxNavy> easy win then
[0:33:24] <%dekkitout> So you sayin youd lose?
[0:33:24] <%maenos2> a cloud would kick your ass
[0:33:24] <%AzureGale> I would fight Cloud tbh
[0:33:24] <%bassoontyphoon> That’s all the info I need
[0:33:24] <%ssjklyco> Perfect,  you yell at clouds
[0:33:24] <Meekest> Isnt Shakespeare that guy from Harry Potter
[0:33:25] <%spartanghost004> fight him only to lose
[0:33:25] <HaroldDonchee> flying nimbus
[0:33:26] <$LightningLynx89> Snort his dust
[0:33:26] <%Dementedpenguin> Shakespeare stream fuck yeah.

[0:33:32] <%Zeikier> @PatStaresAt did you know the Occuria in FF12's english dialogue was written in un-rhymed iambic tetrameter? and Venat the villain Occuria speaks in unrhymed iambic pentameter?

[0:33:43] <+Alopekis> If Shakespeare was so great, why are his bones dust but mine aren't?
[0:33:45] <rReizs> little did you know he died specifically to become a dust based bioweapon
[0:33:47] <+ScrapKingKeita> So you're saying that Shakespeare has a buster sword?
[0:33:47] <chimeraxmachina> I’m gonna fight Shakespeare
[0:33:49] <%HairballCT> also even if shakespeare alive, he was a writer by trade. that fight wouldn't be worth it
[0:33:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> BASED LIES
[0:33:54] <%spartanghost004> yep
[0:33:56] <%DianaTheAscian> He was ten dudes in a trench coat?

[0:34:05] <%saadi90> Like Twitter
[0:34:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> LIES MALE EVERYTHING BETTER
[0:34:06] <stfnotguilty> Shakespeare was a closeted gay aristocrat who wrote under a pen name for a while, then other dudes stole the name for clout.

[0:38:25] <chimeraxmachina> @monkeyweed21 it’s so gross, once made a kid at camp believe I had contagious skin cancer so he would leave me alone or he’d start peeling, too
[0:38:26] <%GabeSweetMan> Now DAT'S a bullshit blazing
[0:38:42] <%itsjusttom25> that started to happen to me when i started to play
[0:38:44] <%Daxalog> I think?
[0:38:44] <Profmcstevie> Kick me down into a room of my peers
[0:38:45] <%SuckerPunchSyd> 👀👀
[0:38:52] <Louie_Salmon> I mean isn't that just a rank
[0:39:02] <$Ziegsy> Is E3 in pst? is that Pacific time?
[0:39:09] <$StrawberryPantsu> OH NO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENING TO ME
[0:39:11] <%BigCoffee> @SaltkeyAndAckfish thank god the new driver's permit is coloured
[0:39:16] <Gorshum> Same here. Started at 6, dominated a set, went straight to 8.
[0:39:16] <jorniev> oh MASS EFFECT 2
[0:39:17] <%Daxalog> I wanted to rematch cause they were kinda close and it de floored me. Still fun.
[0:39:17] <%BoxNavy> Pote
[0:39:17] <%DianaTheAscian> I live on 2
[0:39:19] <%Robot_Nixon_> But Is there a basement level for me?
[0:39:20] <jorniev> i ddint miss it
[0:39:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> Octopimp playing Potemkin RN. Fair and Balanced btw
[0:39:27] <%Daxalog> No Nail betters yet.
[0:39:27] <peachy996> Feng Wei is pretty good
[0:39:34] <i_chevalier> @chimeraxmachina How about the fun fact. the black plague still exists and was last seen in 2006. Yay!
[0:39:50] <ScreamLord> Pat Gawks At
[0:39:51] <@SoFarFetched> geefThink
[0:39:51] <%Ipsenscastle> Pat broken
[0:39:56] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @BigCoffee i mean that doesn't solve the problem, that just means other ethnicities suffer Kappa
[0:40:02] <%dankjerri> HELL YEAH HE DID AND THAT MAKES HIM COOL
[0:40:03] <+trackles_64> you didnt paragon there argument
[0:40:07] <%crazyspartan214> *couldn't*
[0:40:08] <DatAsuna> I assume he meant couldn't
[0:40:09] <Gorshum> @i_chevalier My brain interpreted that as Plague as in the person. I had to read it three times.
[0:40:10] <%Raiden_Breaker> Oh that fight
[0:40:11] <%warpath1911> huh?
[0:40:12] <+abrupt_abe> ?
[0:40:13] <%Monkeyweed21> Octopimp's stream was called "Axl's voice actor protests Axl players" @sonofthedeepsouth
[0:40:13] <%AncelDeLambert> I think you have to max Renegade for Jack
[0:40:15] <%Ipsenscastle> max Paragon should do it
[0:40:16] <%psidefx> What are they trying to do?
[0:40:20] <%DianaTheAscian> ???????
[0:40:21] <%BigCoffee> @SaltkeyAndAckfish Heh sure, but it's still kinda funny
[0:40:21] <%HotSauceFiend> what the question?
[0:40:22] <$LightningLynx89> Didn't Paragon the argument?
[0:40:22] <Profmcstevie> .....what's the criteria
[0:40:22] <Pookiedaexzile> You gotta Paragon their arguement
[0:40:22] <AluxStreams> He's getting loyalty for Miranda, that's what he's doing wrong.
[0:40:24] <faintsmile> *couldnt get both, prob
[0:40:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> More paragon points dummy
[0:40:27] <%Garthunox> OH I KNOW
[0:40:28] <Pookiedaexzile> And make sure everyone is a little pissed
[0:40:29] <%Garthunox> I KNOW
[0:40:29] <PanicSwytch> DON'T SLEEP WITH JACK
[0:40:29] <chimeraxmachina> @i_chevalier I didn’t know he was black
[0:40:30] <%Raiden_Breaker> you didnt have high enough paragon
[0:40:30] <zerointelligence000> might have mispelled some part of the question
[0:40:31] <%AncelDeLambert> stop the fight between Miranda and Jack
[0:40:35] <AsHeadsIsTails> Do Jacks loyalty FIRST there's a bug that makes it near Impossible otherwise
[0:40:35] <%DianaTheAscian> I feel like a sentence is missing
[0:40:36] <Profmcstevie> "2+2=4, help??"
[0:40:38] <%ssjklyco> Clarity is what you're doing wrong
[0:40:38] <%ainzhelm> It might be a glitch or it might be because he never exhausted jack/Miranda’s dialogue before the fight
[0:40:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> why is pat broken
[0:40:40] <BrOOnoh> they fight and you didnt solve their argument
[0:40:50] <$lumporr> dond bang jack the first time
[0:40:50] <%AncelDeLambert> Renegade is easier, it's REALLY high Paragon
[0:40:52] <%Varlinator> You need ALL the paragon to fix the fights
[0:40:53] <%Garthunox> ITS NOT ABOUT THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE! ITS ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE OF POINTS YOU'VE GOTTEN IN THE GAME ITS DUMB!
[0:40:55] <peachy996> You can always go back to the wronged party and say "I was just lying lol"
[0:40:55] <SovPho> jack hot tho
[0:40:57] <+Cactuskris> you can go later and say sorry though
[0:40:58] <$LightningLynx89> Yeah don't sleep with Jack
[0:40:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Stop the Fight with Miranda and Jack with your penis
[0:41:01] <%psidefx> LUL
[0:41:02] <+trackles_64> Bald sex is great
[0:41:02] <firewhiskeys> the choice was always based on the percentage of para/rene choiced available to you
[0:41:03] <ape_hawk> yeah, but hate fucks are great!@
[0:41:03] <faintsmile> jack is so lame
[0:41:06] <ammobasket> @daxalog that happened to Max the other night, he wanted to rematch but the game kicked him up a floor :-p Good luck buddy!
[0:41:07] <%toolofparanoia> You're not being diplomatic enough.
[0:41:08] <%thedankestmeeme> jack is hot doe
[0:41:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Don't shame my ex's
[0:41:11] <%Varlinator> Max Paragon/Renegade
[0:41:11] <%ssjklyco> I hate Jacks design
[0:41:11] <%warpath1911> you can go back and solve the arguement with high enough points
[0:41:13] <%Ipsenscastle> Jack's horrible cueball head is the worst
[0:41:14] <%Raiden_Breaker> its the peak part of the game where its like pick red or blue
[0:41:14] <+GamerWorlock> She fucks you pretty fast
[0:41:14] <BlackStarAura> Lol
[0:41:16] <peachy996> Jack is awesome.
[0:41:20] <%bassoontyphoon> sipsipRude
[0:41:21] <DatAsuna> You know there's unused audio for a mordin and grunt arguement, but they onyl recorded mordin's half
[0:41:24] <BlackStarAura> I love Jack
[0:41:25] <PirateMike_> You dont HAVE to have sex with jack the first time she offers
[0:41:27] <$LightningLynx89> Just kiss Jack, don't fuck her lol
[0:41:29] <%psidefx> You can polish her scalp man its ALL GOOD
[0:41:30] <peachy996> I will hear no ill talk of Bald Chick
[0:41:31] <%ainzhelm> Jacks ME3 design is pretty good
[0:41:32] <$lumporr> jack is space goth gf
[0:41:41] <SovPho> jk i'm a hyper simp for Tali
[0:41:42] <dd44dostivei> i couldn't get zaeed's loyalty with over 75% full paragon, but i was really late in the game
[0:41:46] <%bassoontyphoon> Jack is what I imagine Caillou grows up to be
[0:41:47] <Pookiedaexzile> I like jack bald better
[0:41:49] <SovPho> I dumped Liara for Tali it made a plotpoint it was cool
[0:41:56] <%barkon345> @lumporr punk not goth
[0:42:04] <Profmcstevie> We rebuilt Shepard, he is now very tired
[0:42:06] <%Ipsenscastle> Jack's ME3 design somehow makes her boobs even more naked looking
[0:42:07] <T_Sasquatch> Jackk : urgh you just want sex . Shepard : yes , Jack : ok sure. Later on : urgh i cant believe all you want is sex
[0:42:10] <%shurtal> Day Pat, fighter of the Night Pat
[0:42:12] <SovPho> if you dumb Liara she gets super salty about it while she's the broker lmao
[0:42:12] <%MassConnect> BatPat
[0:42:12] <DatAsuna> I prefer Pattoo to dark pat
[0:42:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> I have to say, I really can not fucking wait for Pat to play the citadel DLC. I hope he goes in as blind as possible.
[0:42:15] <SovPho> dump*
[0:42:15] <peachy996> Zaeed and Miranda vs Jack are the two choices where you have to be HIGH Paragon
[0:42:16] <%QueequegTheater> Having casual sex with Jack who's clearly not all there emotionally is such a scumbag thing to do
[0:42:16] <T_Sasquatch> i love jack tho
[0:42:18] <HaroldDonchee> shepherd
[0:42:19] <%Arkfyre> dark pat is never truely dead, he'll come back with dark clemps one day
[0:42:19] <stantheman_97> wrex
[0:42:20] <balthazar758> dark pat defeated

[0:42:36] <+GamerWorlock> Paige will bring him back one day
[0:42:37] <@SoFarFetched> Im gonna tell on that burrito
[0:42:37] <%DianaTheAscian> Dark Pat won't stop talking abut 3d sonic
[0:42:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Having casual sex with a mentally unstable person is not a Paragon.....unless
[0:42:41] <T_Sasquatch> @QueequegTheater consent is consent LUL
[0:42:41] <%AzureGale> I wont tell either
[0:42:47] <%Robot_Nixon_> Hhhehehe
[0:42:53] <%capnbeefs> Will you ever become the Vtuber legend you are meant to be.
[0:42:54] <chimeraxmachina> I don’t know anything about mass effect but all my friends LOVE it
[0:42:55] <peachy996> Not excited, curious
[0:42:58] <+trackles_64> ANDROMEDA SUCKED
[0:42:59] <%Ipsenscastle> @Pookiedaexzile but the priiiiiize
[0:43:00] <peachy996> Like a car crash
[0:43:01] <+Cactuskris> dragon age was good
[0:43:01] <stantheman_97> i have zero hope
[0:43:01] <ape_hawk> zaeed and kasumi are just better jacob and miranda
[0:43:03] <+dedeec> a new fresh perspective on ME might be a good thing
[0:43:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NEVER GIVE UP HOPE
[0:43:04] <%justnathan18> Zaeed!!
[0:43:04] <Kindred_808> Rebel rebel burritos
[0:43:08] <%bassoontyphoon> psaDab psaDab psaDab VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[0:43:10] <podokdrank> Pat I'm so dumb I thought you was the guy that was doing the what happened series
[0:43:10] <James_Quivers> Including CASEY HUDSON, which is a good thing
[0:43:11] <Profmcstevie> It's a fresh start maybe lol
[0:43:12] <blackjack8182> Get Zaeed
[0:43:13] <+Cactuskris> andromeda was ok
[0:43:15] <%Monkeyweed21> Should I get guilty gear strive on PC?
[0:43:16] <jorniev> i fucking love how garrus calibrates so good he weirds out legion with imposible calibrations
[0:43:21] <ape_hawk> wasnt ME3 made by a completely different team, too?
[0:43:21] <%ainzhelm> It’s fucking crazy how many unironic fans andromeda has
[0:43:22] <BlackStarAura> Definitely not pre-ordering that shit
[0:43:25] <chimeraxmachina> Let’s brainstorm ideas for pats vtuber look
[0:43:25] <%JumboCrunchies> Heads up, Zaeed is barley a character outside of his DLC. Kasumi is pretty fully fledged though.
[0:43:25] <%justnathan18> Andromeda was unfinished lol
[0:43:26] <%Dfreddy8> Anyone remember Anthem?
[0:43:28] <PirateMike_> Andromeda never happened
[0:43:30] <%AzureGale> RIght intoi it
[0:43:30] <+DenpaDev> a dromedary was a fangame
[0:43:33] <DefaultSettiings> twice resurrected Sheperd gonna be voiced by Kevin Hart
[0:43:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> @patstaresat I did the thing someone mentioned in your chat last session. Grunt has more unique dialogue during Garrus' mission than I realized if you want to grab him first. But as you know fucking everyone talks in every mission.
[0:43:35] <%MassConnect> Andromeda was a good idea that needed some more time in oven
[0:43:41] <%strakillias> Always gotta pick up Kasumi first to do her mission and get the baller SMG
[0:43:42] <Profmcstevie> .....where is my good friend No Signal
[0:43:44] <%condemned_15> Would you stream Andromeda for shits n giggles?
[0:43:45] <%bassoontyphoon> Andromeda is so frustrating because it could’ve been good
[0:43:45] <%Raiden_Breaker> I like the orange more then the blue
[0:43:46] <%ThatGuyfromMars> as long as casey hudson stays as far away from Mass Effect, I'm down for whatever they're up to. I also really liked Andromeda so I have confirmed bad opinions
[0:43:51] <%capnbeefs> Andromeda's combat is good but everything else sucks huge balls
[0:43:51] <peachy996> Please tell me we're not muting Omega
[0:44:02] <%knight1210> it's fine
[0:44:05] <+GamerWorlock> Strive on PC is having connection issues
[0:44:11] <%DianaTheAscian> @Monkeyweed21 anime fighters tend to live on console
[0:44:16] <jorniev> Andromeda was so unfinished they didn't even have time to make the new quarian models and other parts of the game
[0:44:16] <Broken_Sonex> @peachy996 We are GOING TO MUTE OMEGA
[0:44:18] <+dedeec> andromeda is like, fine if you can pick it up at a good price
[0:44:18] <skyentombment> "NO, THAT'S TEW LOEWD" - Starfox Adventures shopkeeper
[0:44:22] <%ainzhelm> Andromeda was made by the side team who’s only strandalone work was the ME3 omega dlc
[0:44:26] <%Raiden_Breaker> Halfway through Andromeda Its alright
[0:44:29] <%HairballCT> LUL

[0:44:37] <%bassoontyphoon> Pat getting the best 2 humans right from the start
[0:44:39] <peachy996> Muting Omega is going to ruin the whole atmosphere of that level
[0:44:39] <%dekkitout> "So I did some grinding offscreen..."
[0:44:40] <srv4254> thats dumb

[0:50:49] <Dunmarkh> more dakka
[0:50:52] <%Bane_Kaikyo> ShowLove504 Fun story. When I played ME2 (never played the first) I only knew one thing about ME and that was that every character was romancable.... So I tried to romance Kelly.... later my soul was crushed when I was talking to some of my friends later and they asked who I was planning on sleeping with and I told them "Kelly"..... After some confusion they laughed and said she was in fact not romancable.... I was a sad man that dropped ME2 eventually without finishing. Never met Legion :(
[0:50:55] <+trackles_64> the upgrades dont really matter in 2
[0:50:56] <jorniev> THANE looks pretty cool with the alternate outfit
[0:50:58] <Kraftium> yes
[0:50:59] <SovPho> DPS over everything
[0:51:00] <%Ipsenscastle> the specialisations are nothing
[0:51:00] <DatAsuna> yes
[0:51:00] <jorniev> yes
[0:51:00] <AluxStreams> yes
[0:51:01] <%spartanghost004> yeah there isn't really an rpg in this game
[0:51:02] <+trackles_64> yes
[0:51:02] <ARDM112> Yes
[0:51:02] <SociopathicApe> Yes
[0:51:02] <%machshop> ye
[0:51:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> health or damage
[0:51:04] <jorniev> i think?
[0:51:04] <%MidnightBurst12> ye
[0:51:04] <%AncelDeLambert> pretty sure
[0:51:05] <thetunnelhomer> Yes
[0:51:05] <PirateMike_> Yis
[0:51:06] <$SGrim> Even their skill s are boring, and yes you are in the squad
[0:51:06] <$LightningLynx89> Yes
[0:51:08] <+JaseAdrift> duh
[0:51:08] <Dunmarkh> DPS
[0:51:12] <Gorshum> I think so?
[0:51:13] <buhbuhboat> yeah thats why Miranda one of the best
[0:51:16] <%AncelDeLambert> do you want to not die, or make other things die
[0:51:18] <ElMurpho> Hello there
[0:51:20] <LluthyY> Yeah
[0:51:21] <QuestlordJake> damage go up
[0:51:22] <%MidnightBurst12> only on paper
[0:51:22] <+trackles_64> Jacob is aterrorist
[0:51:25] <BlackStarAura> I always choose health
[0:51:28] <SovPho> He looks a lot better right?
[0:51:30] <TourettesPlays> That perk tragically makes Miranda one of the best squadmates in the game, what a bummer
[0:51:31] <%AncelDeLambert> that's a LOT more damage
[0:51:34] <$SGrim> Yes
[0:51:35] <chimeraxmachina> Squad goals
[0:51:39] <%AzureGale> LUL
[0:51:39] <%spartanghost004> yeah
[0:51:42] <Kraftium> idk health is useless shields is the good shit
[0:51:44] <%radregice> big number
[0:51:47] <Louie_Salmon> But damage though
[0:51:48] <Essixian> Yes but HP go UP
[0:51:49] <%Raiden_Breaker> but kill faster
[0:51:50] <iosephe> Damage though
[0:51:50] <%BigCoffee> yeah but damage
[0:51:50] <%Papa_Bearman> If you're not playing on Insanity, do the second one.
[0:51:50] <+zonbifakku> zonbifakku subscribed with Prime. 
[0:51:55] <TourettesPlays> Higher health is useless tho pat
[0:51:55] <%LumberjackJack> Yeah but damage tho
[0:51:56] <Dunmarkh> damage though
[0:51:57] <+trackles_64> What even is balance lol
[0:51:57] <thetunnelhomer> Nobody cares about Jacob
[0:51:58] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Damage is weighted more than health
[0:51:58] <$lumporr> but if you kill them faster you don't need the health
[0:51:58] <+dante_must_die_exe> when you have SHIELD health is big dumb
[0:51:59] <buhbuhboat> who cares about squadmate health when you can make damage number go up
[0:52:00] <Broken_Sonex> @QueequegTheater But how can you see the ass in this getup?
[0:52:01] <AluxStreams> omg shepard
[0:52:01] <%justnathan18> Jacob should have a skill that makes him more fertile, since hes the only person in ME to ever have a kid
[0:52:01] <DatAsuna> it's because health is less valuable
[0:52:03] <%QueequegTheater> It's more important
[0:52:03] <%MassConnect> Kelly is romanceable.
[0:52:04] <chimeraxmachina> Omg Jacob 👀👀👀 I’m suddenly interested in this game
[0:52:05] <%strakillias> But what if you want him to die tho

[0:52:34] <%Raiden_Breaker> the gift of kasumi
[0:52:35] <%Ipsenscastle> well damage is more valuable than health, which is secondary to shields
[0:52:36] <TourettesPlays> Man the CItadel sucks so much ass in 2 its unreal

[0:53:03] <+trackles_64> Japanase anime charachter?
[0:53:04] <%QueequegTheater> @chimeraxmachina if you romance him as FemShep he cheats on you and knocks up someone else
[0:53:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> @TurtlesAndTentacles Because he cheats on femshep and is a passive aggressive and paranoid person.
[0:53:08] <%Frodiddly> G0-T0???
[0:53:10] <jorniev> PHAMTOM THIEF!
[0:53:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat:Get these Xenos off my Ship Miranda: HEll yeah Pat: Bitch I mean you, Alien scum
[0:53:13] <%Varlinator> I love that you can now see her eyes under the hood
[0:53:16] <peachy996> Miranda is okay, Jacob warms the bench
[0:53:18] <+JaseAdrift> not so secret
[0:53:18] <HaroldDonchee> oh hey visas
[0:53:20] <%knight1210> @bane_kaikyo you can romance her
[0:53:22] <faintsmile> god shepard looks so pissed off
[0:53:24] <Broken_Sonex> "Are one of them Anime People?'
[0:53:27] <%Papa_Bearman> she pretty
[0:53:30] <%machshop> "so i'll put my giant face on this screen"
[0:53:34] <Dova573> i beat all the games, excep3 I never did the dlc
[0:53:36] <ape_hawk> kasumi's cool
[0:53:38] <Too_Much_Nukie> I like this chat-lore that Pat Shep thinks he's an alien.
[0:53:38] <%spartanghost004> she is great
[0:53:40] <+Rhamboned> shes great
[0:53:41] <%MidnightBurst12> she's alright
[0:53:42] <%maenos2> She's cool
[0:53:42] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @Too_Much_Nukie So he's dumbass Kaden again
[0:53:42] <peachy996> She's a pretty good character
[0:53:42] <%Ipsenscastle> Kasumi is great
[0:53:42] <Dova573> so this is new to me
[0:53:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> she's fun
[0:53:47] <%justnathan18> Jacob and Jack are in my  "never leaves the ship" crew
[0:53:47] <Thepothero> she s cool
[0:53:49] <%moonmintparadise> yeah, which is why she projects herself on a big fucking screen for anyone to see
[0:53:49] <DefaultSettiings> Shepats face is too small for his head
[0:53:49] <%Ranryu692> she's awesome
[0:53:49] <%sunsetdisc0> her mission is fun
[0:53:50] <%Varlinator> Her DLC is GREAT!
[0:53:52] <$SGrim> So, bullshit? Got it.
[0:53:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Kasumi is really great. Has dialogue on every single main mission and most side missions.
[0:53:53] <+trackles_64> chakras
[0:53:54] <peachy996> Not the worst not the best
[0:53:54] <%Raiden_Breaker> her trust mission is ok
[0:53:55] <%LumberjackJack> She's fun. Amongst the human characters, she's one of the better ones. And has overload.
[0:53:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> She has a crush on Jasob tho
[0:53:56] <DatAsuna> Kasumi is great BUT she doesn't get ship conversations and that sucks.
[0:53:56] <MrPandastic> Kasumi is great.
[0:53:56] <PirateMike_> Why is Shepard looking like skelethor
[0:53:58] <ARDM112> Her loyalty mission is fun
[0:54:00] <%Raiden_Breaker> she is cool
[0:54:02] <Essixian> "You've got that protag aura"
[0:54:02] <%Ipsenscastle> she has some of the best companion dialogue in missions
[0:54:03] <+JohnTimbre> Her loyalty mission has a dope SMG
[0:54:05] <%Zeikier> a certain ara ara about you
[0:54:06] <%strakillias> Do her loyalty mission immediately because GUN
[0:54:09] <DatAsuna> Her and zaeed are in the no convo DLC ghetto
[0:54:11] <chimeraxmachina> @queequegtheater ah damn...yeah no got enough of that w people in real life. But at least there’s some eye candy
[0:54:11] <BlackStarAura> Her loyalty mission is so good
[0:54:11] <T_Sasquatch> She is sooo op
[0:54:12] <%Varlinator> Her abilities are kinda naff tho
[0:54:23] <T_Sasquatch> no spoilz
[0:54:32] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> That Alien is gross looking
[0:54:36] <%maenos2> her mission is fun
[0:54:36] <+trackles_64> Heist mission
[0:54:38] <DatAsuna> Man I remember how AWFUL hock's voice acting is
[0:54:38] <%LumberjackJack> 007 mission is a gooo
[0:54:39] <%machshop> Hock has the weirdest fucking accent i've ever heard
[0:54:41] <%AzureGale> Shepard's Thirteen
[0:54:44] <peachy996> She is the Infiltrator of the Group
[0:54:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> Don't do her loyalty mission immediately because it's fairly tough.
[0:54:52] <BlackStarAura> Hock is a piece of shit
[0:54:54] <%Zeikier> hell yeah gimme the lingerie
[0:54:55] <deviljhojho_> Hocka
[0:55:00] <%LumberjackJack> OH GOD, HOCK HAS THE WORST/BEST ACCENT EVER
[0:55:02] <$lumporr> big hawk?
[0:55:05] <%Torus1025> Her mission rules
[0:55:05] <televisedrevolting> @datasuna He sounds like he's from every European country.
[0:55:07] <%Papa_Bearman> It's a two-person loyalty mission.
[0:55:09] <Basch71> had the game on veteran, she was soloing rooms LUL
[0:55:09] <DatAsuna> Hock has the weirdest accent
[0:55:09] <%Varlinator> @PatStaresAt You'll want some Paragon/Renegade for her DLC
[0:55:11] <Thepothero> Hauke ?
[0:55:14] <i_chevalier> I really wish there was a game about being a space trucker.
[0:55:16] <DefaultSettiings> we just gonna ignore this recently dead celebrity having a conversation with a television about Cerberus in a public area
[0:55:17] <%Garthunox> @LumberjackJack It's just a South African accent
[0:55:19] <+trackles_64> were the muscle
[0:55:28] <DatAsuna> black box in your head
[0:55:29] <%Ipsenscastle> Hock is just from South Africa guys, don't be racist
[0:55:31] <T_Sasquatch> we haave to steal his HEART
[0:55:32] <%machshop> @televisedrevolting with some south africa mixed in or something, it's real weird
[0:55:36] <%ssjklyco> She's bad at hiding her face
[0:55:37] <Broken_Sonex> @LumberjackJack MISTA G U M
[0:55:43] <%LumberjackJack> @Garthunox I remember it being SUPER heavy.
[0:55:49] <%QueequegTheater> "Did he sling the dick like a porn star"
[0:55:49] <SaltyAzteca> Did I miss best Salarian yet?
[0:55:50] <%Dakuu75> Sofarfetched tricked me on the discord announcement. I only read the first line and thought Pat was playing GG.
[0:55:55] <%Zeikier> Nenji Ogata
[0:55:59] <ske1eman> Do Kasumi's mission first, the weapon you get there is AMAZING
[0:56:04] <%AzureGale> Wait, Infamous crossed over with this game?
[0:56:07] <%Garthunox> @LumberjackJack OH ITS SUPER HEAVY! But i've known people with that kinda accent
[0:56:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Hello
[0:56:16] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Everyone in this transit station is seeing this conversation.
[0:56:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> I don't remember if they ever say what his information is.
[0:56:27] <HaroldDonchee> oh god. aliens are going to learn about italians
[0:56:33] <%MassConnect> Shepard got a new lamp, too
[0:56:39] <AluxStreams> Your brightness is so high you can see Kasumi's face that's supposed to be impossible to see fully. lol
[0:56:44] <%Dakuu75> "It'll be a fuck?"
[0:56:48] <%Papa_Bearman> SPOILER:  You're not lucky.
[0:56:49] <$lumporr> hahaahah
[0:56:49] <%machshop> shepard's not a good artist anyway
[0:56:49] <Pookiedaexzile> thicc
[0:56:50] <DefaultSettiings> Kasumi got cake
[0:56:52] <%LumberjackJack> Low key, Kasumi's the hottest in M.E.
[0:56:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Probably don't do Kasumi's mission first. It's tough. Especially if you've never done it before. You get the best SMG in the game for doing it.
[0:56:57] <chimeraxmachina> So she really woke up and was like “yeah I’m gonna draw a perfect purple square on my lower lip” huh
[0:56:58] <%Garthunox> @AluxStreams No thats just new for the LE
[0:57:01] <%NateyBeak> GO GET HER NOW
[0:57:02] <HaroldDonchee> she just seems like the human version of tali
[0:57:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> shes great
[0:57:02] <$SGrim> Immediately ditch Miranda
[0:57:03] <$lumporr> can you smooch her butt
[0:57:05] <DatAsuna> Now immediately bench jacob
[0:57:06] <%Zeikier> see you on the shep, Shippard
[0:57:07] <peachy996> Do Miranda and Kasumi, fuck Jacob
[0:57:08] <T_Sasquatch> Best GIRL
[0:57:10] <DatAsuna> It's not tough
[0:57:10] <Pookiedaexzile> So she's a Human Qurian
[0:57:10] <$Futurecity10> You can do it right now, its really easy
[0:57:11] <%Garthunox> Shep Shippard
[0:57:13] <Basch71> its not hard at all
[0:57:16] <Essixian> @LumberjackJack Did you forget Tali exists
[0:57:17] <%dekkitout> Cheat?
[0:57:17] <jorniev> SHE JUST SNEAKS ON BOARD
[0:57:18] <%Garthunox> @Zeikier :D
[0:57:20] <%spartanghost004> she is great
[0:57:20] <%LumberjackJack> Yup
[0:57:21] <%Raiden_Breaker> nice
[0:57:21] <%Papa_Bearman> OK.
[0:57:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YES
[0:57:22] <peachy996> Jacob stays on the Bench
[0:57:22] <James_Quivers> MADMAN
[0:57:23] <faintsmile> yep
[0:57:24] <$lumporr> can you smooch her butt???
[0:57:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Aight
[0:57:24] <$LightningLynx89> Saaaaaaaaaaaaaaame
[0:57:25] <%machshop> that's fair
[0:57:26] <%Papa_Bearman> That's a perfectly viable method.
[0:57:26] <%MidnightBurst12> it gets pretty ridiculous
[0:57:27] <Profmcstevie> Here comes the calendar
[0:57:28] <+SinnerEbru> ah, the correct way
[0:57:28] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt Thats exactly what I did, good stuff
[0:57:29] <Broken_Sonex> YO SHE'S GOT CAKE!
[0:57:32] <%Dakuu75> typical rpg grinding stats
[0:57:33] <myriad_truth> That works
[0:57:33] <Pookiedaexzile> He gets it
[0:57:33] <mak0t0yukii> Madman
[0:57:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THIS IS THE WAY PATRICK
[0:57:35] <%JoshManVGH> Everyone except Legion, right?
[0:57:37] <DatAsuna> Whoever told you it's hard is probably just awful at the game. lol
[0:57:38] <%justnathan18> Correct way to do things
[0:57:38] <televisedrevolting> That feels so much more annoying then just doing them as they come.
[0:57:41] <jorniev> YES
[0:57:41] <BlackStarAura> Wow
[0:57:42] <%Papa_Bearman> Shepard only travels with the finest company.
[0:57:43] <+flexin_apex> Same
[0:57:44] <%Varlinator> LUL
[0:57:49] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Do it anyways, you get a really good gun
[0:57:49] <%Varlinator> Goodbye Jacob
[0:57:49] <LluthyY> Best Way lol
[0:57:49] <%AzureGale> Wait did Pat say something nice about Miranda?
[0:57:51] <ske1eman> no man, the Locust is way worth it
[0:57:52] <Basch71> I usually do it immediately mainly for the smg
[0:57:53] <AluxStreams> Shadow Strike is really solid.
[0:57:53] <DefaultSettiings> Shepat doesn't deserve a harem with that fucking face
[0:57:55] <GustauveVIII> shadow strike hits pretty hard
[0:57:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @datasuna fo real
[0:57:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Human Quarian
[0:58:00] <%justnathan18> Whats wrong with Miranda's look
[0:58:00] <DatAsuna> Shadow Stike is actually a teleport
[0:58:02] <%MassConnect> Shadow strike gets behind cover
[0:58:03] <ape_hawk> shes infiltrator but with stabbing, not sniping
[0:58:03] <Thepothero> ME3 that ability is op
[0:58:11] <ARDM112> Shadow Strike is her main thing
[0:58:13] <Broken_Sonex> ASS SQUAD.
[0:58:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Tali but you can fuck her right out the box......damn thats fucked up
[0:58:16] <tattleworm> shadowstrike is vanguard but backstabs, yeah
[0:58:17] <%Varlinator> She is, but she isn't. She doesn't snipe
[0:58:18] <$SGrim> Always damage
[0:58:18] <%Papa_Bearman> Power recharge is INSANE.
[0:58:19] <$Futurecity10> power recharge
[0:58:19] <%ainzhelm> @patstaresat Take legion to tali’s loyalty. You get unique scenes
[0:58:21] <televisedrevolting> The Locust+Warp Ammo just kinda melts.
[0:58:24] <$lumporr> HOW COME YOU CAN'T SMOOCH HER BUTT
[0:58:24] <%machshop> get used to it
[0:58:26] <$SGrim> It isn't, but damage
[0:58:26] <DatAsuna> Shadow strike is her best ability and basically "teleports behind you"
[0:58:28] <%LumberjackJack> Yeeeeaaaaah, most passives in ME2 are so subtle
[0:58:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Shadow Strike also makes her teleport because of how the game works. So it's fucking busted. You can use it to get her out of danger or to finish an enemy off risk free.
[0:58:30] <%Raiden_Breaker> similar to a point its hard to choose
[0:58:31] <%AzureGale> Yeah it really isn't
[0:58:32] <$SGrim> fool
[0:58:34] <%Varlinator> Recharge
[0:58:36] <%Monkeyweed21> its a passive
[0:58:37] <Basch71> she bonks people with her tac cloak
[0:58:42] <Broken_Sonex> @justnathan18 She's wearing armour
[0:58:44] <Essixian> @lumporr THAT'S WHAT R34 IS FOR
[0:58:45] <%AzureGale> Oh ho ho
[0:58:47] <peachy996> GOILS
[0:58:48] <%bassoontyphoon> Power echarge
[0:58:49] <$lumporr> LOUIE?
[0:58:49] <T_Sasquatch> Kasumi is op af
[0:58:51] <SaltyAzteca> Which gun Kappa
[0:58:51] <%machshop> i think you mean "lllllllllllllladies"
[0:58:52] <myriad_truth> I just pick whatever their class is
[0:58:52] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Whip it ooooooout
[0:58:53] <%sunsetdisc0> how tf do you get enough time after getting the iff to do all their missions???
[0:58:53] <DatAsuna> ME3 MP let you use her shadow strike with a katana as well
[0:58:56] <%MugenSandan> @datasuna excuse you it's spelled TELEPROT
[0:58:56] <%goose_attack_almanac> Is that a euphemism for penis
[0:58:57] <jorniev> HELL YEAH
[0:58:58] <ScreamLord> sure
[0:58:59] <Thepothero> yes
[0:59:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah.

[0:59:50] <%AzureGale> ALSO MAKES A TON OF GODDAMN SENSE
[0:59:51] <%ainzhelm> You don’t need it
[0:59:55] <ScreamLord> 3 times would be 90+ kilotons
[0:59:56] <%Dakuu75> WTF is this drill-sergeant NERD, shit?????? lol
[0:59:58] <i_chevalier> wait. weren't you already a specter
[1:00:00] <$lumporr> i'd think whoever discovered partial pressure of gasses is probably the deadliest guy in space
[1:00:03] <%QueequegTheater> WE DO NOT EYEBALL IT, SERVICEMAN CHUNG

[1:00:10] <+wizard_of_diamonds> RUINING SOMEONE'S DAY
[1:00:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> @doc_ock_rokc Its literally about space wizards, it never made sense
[1:00:16] <%Varlinator> This Gunnery Chief >>>> Gunnery Chief Ashley Williams
[1:00:17] <T_Sasquatch> This shit made me think so hard
[1:00:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> I fucking love this bit because this single conversation explains to the player why space combat is fucking rad and why ships aren't just constantly firing like star wars.

[1:10:11] <+StoopKid241> Do they really not have recording devices on their armor and stuff??
[1:10:15] <Profmcstevie> A SINGLE ASARI COULD READ OUR MEMORIES FFS
[1:10:15] <myriad_truth> That was the best thing about ME3
[1:10:16] <%dekkitout> Was there deadass no followup investigation? Is due diligence not a thing in space?
[1:10:18] <+cursedwithadhd> I wish Shepard actually scream I SHOULD HAVE LET YOU DIE
[1:10:20] <+MightyDuckShoes> How about Saren being a fucking zombie!!!
[1:10:20] <BlackStarAura> If you’d let them die, the replacements don’t even want to talk to you in 2
[1:10:25] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Bruh
[1:10:26] <T_Sasquatch> WASNT A REAPER LITERALLY at the citadel

[1:10:32] <+trackles_64> arseholes
[1:10:34] <Pookiedaexzile> IT ATTACKED YOU
[1:10:35] <James_Quivers> HE CHARISMAED THE ROBOTS
[1:10:35] <HaroldDonchee> this is legitimately stupid. a reaper actually fucked the citadel but nah they're not real
[1:10:37] <%spartanghost004> he compelled a bunch of robots right
[1:10:37] <Gorshum> It's good to see every species elected their worst people.
[1:10:38] <%bassoontyphoon> literally why doesn't the asari councilwoman just read your memories
[1:10:39] <%Monkeyweed21> HE TURNED INTO A ROBO ZOMBIE
[1:10:42] <DatAsuna> @StoopKid241 literally the only reason anything in mass effect happens is cause ashely's squad had bodycams
[1:10:42] <%MidnightBurst12> *Disconnect*
[1:10:43] <jorniev> THEY ARE JUST STRAIGHT UP LYING TO YOU
[1:10:45] <Pookiedaexzile> YOU SAW IT
[1:10:46] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> God this game will make you a complete libertarian lol
[1:10:46] <Ekaelis> They're so idiotic
[1:10:46] <ape_hawk> THIS IS WHY THE COUNCIL DIES ALL THE TIME
[1:10:49] <falyden> the mental gymnastics on this bitch
[1:10:49] <DefaultSettiings> this is your fault for saving them SeemsGood
[1:10:51] <%moonmintparadise> this kind of dialogue makes ME3 so much funnier
[1:10:53] <Wolfstriker121> YOU LEGIT SAW IT you blind council!!!

[1:11:08] <%AzureGale> FUCKING BRUH

[1:11:10] <faintsmile> gaslight girlboss gatekeep
[1:11:10] <+dedeec> it's the gaslight council
[1:11:10] <%ainzhelm> Letting them die is a bit underwhelming since they just hide from you
[1:11:12] <$lumporr> NEW MISSION: FIND AND KILL THE COUNCIL
[1:11:13] <%Varlinator> These are terrible excuses! Holy shit! YOU GUYS SUCK ASS!
[1:11:14] <%bassoontyphoon> [GLASS THEM]

[1:11:19] <Teras_ode> I love how at this point Legion says "we literally don't have tech like that" LUL
[1:11:19] <AluxStreams> [disconnect]
[1:11:19] <Kraftium> not believing the hologram is the biggest BS
[1:11:20] <aiutare47> The council is denying it because they don’t want to believe it. That’s also why they’re suppressing the news.
[1:11:20] <%Papa_Bearman> ***
[1:11:20] <%derpy_platypus> there is no war in Ba Sing Se
[1:11:22] <%Puhff> yeah this is insane
[1:11:22] <%ssjklyco> I like how you proved them wrong about the Citadel invasion, and they still do the same mistake that caused you to go rogue.
[1:11:24] <jorniev> IM CONVINCED THEY ARE JUST LYING TO EVERYONE
[1:11:24] <+MightyDuckShoes> What if the Council was indoctrinated?
[1:11:24] <SaltyAzteca> THIS IS WHY WE DISCONNECT YOU
[1:11:26] <T_Sasquatch> i know they are meant to make you hate them but holy shit i would lose my shit
[1:11:34] <stantheman_97> the council fucking sucks
[1:11:34] <HeroToxiko> coulda let them die LUL
[1:11:34] <James_Quivers> That's the Karen option
[1:11:34] <%MidnightBurst12> Pat=Paragon???
[1:11:35] <%Puhff> I SAVED YOUR LIVES
[1:11:37] <Essixian> "THE HUMAN SUPREMACISTS WERE RIGHT ABOUT YOU"
[1:11:38] <%Papa_Bearman> ...Are clips not allowed in this chat?
[1:11:39] <iosephe> The Geth joined Saren because of Saren convincing them of Sovereign, but the Geth created Sovereign
[1:11:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> I like how Anderson nods.
[1:11:43] <%ainzhelm> @ranryu692 Where?
[1:11:44] <%justnathan18> Lmfao Pat implying hes not paragon by default

[1:11:54] <zerointelligence000> You saved their asses, they should just take your word on the space squids
[1:12:01] <Wolfstriker121> i reallllyy hate them three
[1:12:03] <%GalacticaPhanto> Yeyeye you tell em Anderson
[1:12:06] <+dedeec> @aiutare47 too many people seem to not get this
[1:12:06] <%spartanghost004> they still suck
[1:12:07] <$lumporr> MAYBE IF *YOU* REVIVED ME I'D BE WORKING FOR YOU
[1:12:09] <%goose_attack_almanac> Being Gaslit by the shitheads who allowed Borg-as-shit Saren to fuck around
[1:12:10] <%Papa_Bearman> Damn.  Well, I have it for posterity.
[1:12:13] <%dekkitout> That's pretty reasonable
[1:12:16] <%Varlinator> REFUSE!
[1:12:17] <Pookiedaexzile> "Working for": Forcefully  bringing him back to life
[1:12:18] <stantheman_97> fair honestly
[1:12:23] <HaroldDonchee> shepherd has cerberus money. does he even need this shit
[1:12:26] <%JohnAtDawn> WHY NOT?!
[1:12:27] <+RoByte2> File reports? You'd just hang up on them anyway
[1:12:29] <%QueequegTheater> "I could hang up on you again, for old time's sake"
[1:12:34] <deviljhojho_> Fuck it, garrus was right
[1:12:35] <%Varlinator> FUCK EM
[1:12:35] <myriad_truth> Hey Shepard, STAY AWAY FROM US CRZY

[1:12:39] <peachy996> Yeah sure I guess
[1:12:39] <deviljhojho_> im back in
[1:12:40] <%ainzhelm> So it’s treason then
[1:12:40] <$SGrim> The council, aside from the turian, are all fairly reasonable here.
[1:12:45] <%Papa_Bearman> "Instead of charging you with treason and giving you an automatic life sentence, we're going to instead allow you to murder without consequence."
[1:12:52] <%bassoontyphoon> i think given the bereaucratic hellhole its the best they can do
[1:12:53] <$LightningLynx89> "on my side"
[1:12:53] <AluxStreams> Master Thief Kasumi just standing there.
[1:12:53] <SaltyAzteca> @QueequegTheater its tradition at this point LUL

[1:13:00] <DefaultSettiings> "they literally undeaded me tho"
[1:13:00] <%spartanghost004> cracked out nerds

[1:13:11] <%NopeBadguy> did i miss AH YES REAPERS
[1:13:12] <BlackStarAura> Fuck the Council
[1:13:13] <%justnathan18> When humanity joined space, what happened to everyone who was "Earth rich" like were they suddenly poor because their currency was basically nothing?
[1:13:14] <%ThatGuyfromMars> the council: accuses you of treason also the council: reinstates you as a spectre
[1:13:25] <%Monkeyweed21> @NopeBadguy just did
[1:13:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Fuck that, They die in 1 and get replace here
[1:13:26] <%ThatGuyfromMars> yes @NopeBadguy

[1:15:47] <%machshop> that's just her regular stance
[1:15:47] <James_Quivers> Kasumi is just staring at a wall
[1:15:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> Kasumi is using the internet.
[1:15:49] <$Ziegsy> Watsoning in the back
[1:15:49] <%QueequegTheater> Isnt that more of an I-pose
[1:15:49] <peachy996> A Posing is cool

[1:15:55] <ape_hawk> i mean, miranda DOES have the personality of a piece of 2x4
[1:15:55] <alroy900> perfectly immobile
[1:15:57] <+dedeec> @justnathan18 i got confused as fuck about what you were talking about lol
[1:15:58] <DatAsuna> you guys should really research the keepers more
[1:15:59] <%SuckerPunchSyd> A
[1:16:04] <%Ynkubus_> SHe not even A posing, its just a bland idle pose
[1:16:07] <Tracazoid> Kasumi's checking Udina's mail
[1:16:08] <xhodocto385> Miranda LuL
[1:16:13] <%justnathan18> Kasumi is like "oh shit, theres a lot of info here
[1:16:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> Maybe we should scan the keepers.
[1:16:18] <dd44dostivei> that's stupid. sovereign was massive
[1:16:20] <j2tronic> Dear god ur me2 patshep is so much worse than me1 lol
[1:16:26] <+trackles_64> He was huge
[1:16:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> Now that we know they are at the very least tangentially related to the reapers.
[1:16:29] <AluxStreams> Shit got stole and sold.
[1:16:30] <ScreamLord> Everyone that want to make a career out of politics should have to go through a bi=annual psyche evaluation
[1:16:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt This is a plot point in 3.
[1:16:33] <Chaos_Aether> how is that Possible
[1:16:34] <James_Quivers> Vorcha took all the scraps
[1:16:34] <+MightyDuckShoes> @ynkubus_ She isn't moving.
[1:16:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Bruh but "Reaper Parts" is good money
[1:16:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt people want reaper tech
[1:16:37] <%LumberjackJack> It did blow up in space with the arms open
[1:16:39] <%Raiden_Breaker> Joker did too much of a good job
[1:16:40] <%maenos2> statue of liberty's a bit smaller i think isn't it
[1:16:43] <%Puhff> keepers are fast tho
[1:16:44] <j2tronic> That’s dumb af
[1:16:45] <%hat_under_bread> It kinda makes sense with how the Keepers are designated cover-up bots.
[1:16:45] <%spartanghost004> they built an AI on a ship with most of it
[1:16:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> People straight up took Sovereign's corpse and sold it.
[1:16:47] <xhodocto385> i would live in this place if it were real, the Citadel looks beyond magnificient
[1:16:48] <signofzeta> honestly there should've been a questline dedicated to tracking down reaper wreckage
[1:16:48] <Pookiedaexzile> imagine a Reaper Hull pistol
[1:16:51] <%CalderGaming> @j2tronic he tried to make it look similar but that didn't pan out so he went with Old And Tired
[1:16:55] <MrPandastic> How the fuck did you not find anything. The citadel was ground zero for that thing.
[1:16:56] <+chuckthecanuck> your character looks like shit lol
[1:16:58] <T_Sasquatch> It was large enough to make the citadel look similar in size
[1:17:04] <%dekkitout> Where's my brocacho
[1:17:07] <$Ziegsy> im shocked they didnt bother to give your team idle animations
[1:17:09] <%Ranryu692> couldn't the council have just explained why they didn't want the reapers to be public knowledge and had the rest of the conversation been the same?
[1:17:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> They found stuff, just not enough.
[1:17:11] <%machshop> Staff Commander is a beefy title
[1:17:13] <xhodocto385> unless the reapers appear, then i would not live here LuL
[1:17:18] <%bassoontyphoon> GayPride GayPride GayPride
[1:17:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> Looters and keepers took the majority.
[1:17:19] <+trackles_64> its not that classifoed
[1:17:20] <%OldOnyx> meh, the keepers probably would try to break it down and conceal it's nature at least. They ARE reaper creations
[1:17:23] <ScreamLord> Bigger. Sovereign was over 2 kilometers long. That over 2 miles
[1:17:24] <%Ynkubus_> @MightyDuckShoes idling can also mean completely non moving
[1:17:30] <CrypticMochi> I bet there are like millions of keepers hidden
[1:17:33] <ape_hawk> Anderson shouldve been a squad member in ME3
[1:17:35] <%GalacticaPhanto> I mean you literally just became a Spectre again so you should have clearance
[1:17:43] <j2tronic> @caldergaming lol that makes sense but he just looks like some sort of ginger vampire
[1:17:45] <$lumporr> i like fighting the *bad* fight
[1:17:47] <xhodocto385> but the Keepers are cute!, look at their eyes
[1:17:48] <James_Quivers> Anderson crewmate would've been sick
[1:17:52] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Nah thats just dealing with the council
[1:17:53] <BlackStarAura> I blame them, Anderson
[1:17:55] <%spartanghost004> he was the best choice for the first councilor
[1:17:55] <Wolfstriker121> hes too old for this shit lol
[1:17:57] <SaltyAzteca> noooooooo yer nooooot
[1:17:58] <%Raiden_Breaker> what a weird question
[1:17:59] <+megaman_sentinel> i love this guys voice in everthing he do
[1:18:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> I remember when they showed gameplay footage of 3 and tricked us all into thinking Anderson would join the party.
[1:18:00] <AluxStreams> Liara is older than Anderson.
[1:18:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Two Miles of Raw material is not gonna dissapear
[1:18:01] <%machshop> @ScreamLord i don't think that's right, 5 km is 3.1 miles
[1:18:03] <%AzureGale> Anderson is too old for this shit
[1:18:05] <deviljhojho_> gorilla walk
[1:18:07] <%QueequegTheater> HE WALK
[1:18:07] <dd44dostivei> shepard keeps asking friends to do this and it sounds crazy each time
[1:18:08] <Dunmarkh> PogChamp
[1:18:09] <+dedeec> Anderson as a crewmate would be kinda cool but I prefer him as a guy just watching from the sidelines
[1:18:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> He move!
[1:18:11] <Zebroneath> yay, terrorism!
[1:18:11] <%dekkitout> So graceful
[1:18:11] <peachy996> Talk to Avina with Kasumi in your squad
[1:18:13] <%MugenSandan> ELMCOR
[1:18:14] <Broken_Sonex> Imagine if you cut back to Shepard and Miranda and Kasumi are just spinning in place
[1:18:14] <James_Quivers> They learned how to walk in these two years
[1:18:15] <%kyh9> I should go
[1:18:17] <%Papa_Bearman> Yeah, I need to go destroy a mass relay and annihilate an entire species.

[1:18:22] <Essixian> HE'S SCHMOOVIN'
[1:18:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yup
[1:18:24] <%Varlinator> I was always sad that this was all you got of the presidium in ME2
[1:18:24] <$lumporr> @AluxStreams she's like 110 isn't she
[1:18:24] <+MightyDuckShoes> @ynkubus_ No, it can't. That's the point of idling. People shift their feet. They turn their heads. She's more inactive than the holograms
[1:18:24] <+trackles_64> like a big zangeif
[1:18:27] <%Papa_Bearman> Yup, this is it.
[1:18:27] <%Monkeyweed21> "I'm old, black, and really cool, I will die right away"
[1:18:29] <%Ranryu692> yeah, ME2 Citadel sucks
[1:18:29] <signofzeta> it's a shame you don't get to explore the presidium

[1:18:32] <j2tronic> Kasumi a baddie tho

[1:18:45] <%weissguard> Cue the Jurassic Park theme
[1:18:46] <%LumberjackJack> Omega time?
[1:18:48] <BlackStarAura> Elcor always disappears at the end of that dialogue

[1:19:44] <knight_verse> So you not buying anything on the Citadel huh... ok.
[1:19:44] <%NocturneNovember> it's so Karen
[1:19:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> Vega too honestly.
[1:19:48] <%spartanghost004> your going to hangout with the cool kids in the south of the galaxy
[1:19:49] <$Ziegsy> kellys hand looked like she was having a stealth scratch
[1:19:53] <+dedeec> Vega is overhated, he's a bro and voted by the main man Prinze Jr.
[1:19:53] <Pookiedaexzile> bro Vega better be good with the way people keep hyping him
[1:19:54] <SaphronBlackbourne> I really don't mind them scaling the Citadel, felt like I spent most of 1 running through useless space
[1:19:54] <gh1drah> i hope they release the ME3 multiplayer as dlc later, it was so fun to just grind
[1:19:55] <peachy996> Kasumi, Vega, Miranda, Jack and Zaeed are the only interesting human squadmates
[1:19:56] <%kyh9> Kasumi always gave me Older Yuffie vibes
[1:19:58] <HaroldDonchee> man I love Hoodie shepherd
[1:19:59] <xhodocto385> Kellyren KEKW
[1:19:59] <+dedeec> voiced*
[1:19:59] <seniormeatbox> man they SHOULD NOT have used the ME3 model as a base
[1:20:02] <+MightyDuckShoes> why did they change Kelly so much?
[1:20:05] <%Raiden_Breaker> Kelly reporting to the illusive man its sounds like it
[1:20:05] <Pookiedaexzile> He better be the sickest shit in the universe
[1:20:05] <peachy996> Oh and ME1 Ash
[1:20:15] <ape_hawk> dawww
[1:20:20] <seniormeatbox> @MightyDuckShoes its her ME3 model that was meant to be seen once
[1:20:20] <%spartanghost004> oh I let them keep her body for research purposes
[1:20:20] <%bassoontyphoon> goddamn thats really sweet
[1:20:22] <Dunmarkh> that's nice
[1:20:23] <%bread_assassin> @kyh9 Good in terms of character or gameplay, because Miranda is like the best ME2 companion.

[1:20:42] <%spartanghost004> crew deck in observation

[1:22:16] <$lumporr> what a lame ass calling card
[1:22:18] <%heartlesshealer> nice
[1:22:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> You don't get a dialogue wheel.
[1:22:21] <peachy996> Oh yea bc Kasumi is DLC this is the extent of her character depth

[1:22:37] <%moondog_> moondog_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! fat...me big man
[1:22:38] <$dalmek> a bust of Patshep
[1:22:42] <%Varlinator> Is that Thanos?!
[1:22:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> @peachy996 That I don't agree with. She has dialogue on every single mission to flesh her out.
[1:22:44] <j2tronic> Come back later, I’m sure I’ll have more to talk about!
[1:22:44] <Broken_Sonex> THANOS BUST
[1:22:45] <Wolfstriker121> legit thanos!!!
[1:22:45] <+MightyDuckShoes> It's Shep!
[1:22:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> Plus her loyalty mission.
[1:22:53] <Wolfstriker121> THATS FUCKING THANOS!!
[1:22:59] <%barkon345> Man Shepard went from looking like Clint Howard to looking like a caveman

[1:23:23] <Pookiedaexzile> What about the other slaves
[1:23:26] <+MightyDuckShoes> Is she just summarizing every issue of her Dark Horse miniseries?
[1:23:29] <peachy996> @Too_Much_Nukie Maybe but I wish you could have actual conversations with her (and Zaeed) instead of this
[1:23:31] <balthazar758> cool
[1:23:31] <deviljhojho_> gottem
[1:23:33] <SaltyAzteca> HARDY BOYS
[1:23:33] <%LumberjackJack> NEEEEEEEEEERD

[1:23:34] <$lumporr> @ARToo_Am_Me fuck you
[1:23:36] <i_chevalier> dude did you just bring all you illegal shit on to my ship
[1:23:36] <James_Quivers> Kasumi hates Kindles
[1:23:37] <T_Sasquatch> true
[1:23:37] <j2tronic> I wanna take Kasumi’s rose 😈
[1:23:38] <%NateyBeak> wtf kasumi is cool
[1:23:38] <%Varlinator> Neeeeerd
[1:23:39] <xhodocto385> no manga? DansGame
[1:23:40] <myriad_truth> I do like reading books
[1:23:40] <chimeraxmachina> Ok this lady is actually pretty cool
[1:23:41] <%knight1210> the other slaves
[1:23:42] <j2tronic> 😏
[1:23:42] <DatAsuna> kasumi hates audible
[1:23:46] <Essixian> tomatoBWL NERD
[1:23:49] <mak0t0yukii> Paperback is better than digital HA
[1:23:51] <%kyh9> Kasumi really feels like an older Yuffie to me, I don't know why
[1:23:51] <AluxStreams> Where is Kasumi's gamer cube?
[1:23:53] <jorniev> yup
[1:23:57] <%Monkeyweed21> she needs her BL manga
[1:23:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> @peachy996 Oh yeah for sure. But I think they did a good job of giving them interesting personalities without a dialogue tree.
[1:24:02] <jorniev> its the sad thing
[1:24:03] <%LumberjackJack> Sad that Kasumi and Zaeed have the auto-dialogue that ME3 has
[1:24:05] <thebalticguy1> dlc characters dont
[1:24:05] <James_Quivers> BTW Pat DLC crewmates in this game don't get real wheels, yeah
[1:24:06] <T_Sasquatch> i hate audio books so much
[1:24:06] <tattleworm> dlc characters just get barks rather than trees, yeah
[1:24:06] <%kyh9> She comments on missions I think
[1:24:07] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Gun couch
[1:24:08] <Pookiedaexzile> This is what they do with DLC characters
[1:24:08] <+ThomasOfTroy> Same for Zaeed
[1:24:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah she has a bunch of these.
[1:24:13] <+trackles_64> doggo
[1:24:14] <LluthyY> yeah just new dialogue here and there
[1:24:16] <AngryAsian5> Unfortunately she does not get actual dialogue
[1:24:17] <%MassConnect> I hate books so much
[1:24:18] <TomFrancis_> what dat dog do
[1:24:18] <CatRidder> show dog
[1:24:19] <falyden> my biggest fear is the window in space breaking
[1:24:22] <thebalticguy1> shell have comments on all missions tho
[1:24:24] <%Varlinator> Come back to her often for extra dialogue about the crew
[1:24:25] <DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt despite no real convos, she will get new lines after everyone else's loyalty missions about them.
[1:24:27] <ape_hawk> STEAL MY PEEPEE, KASUMI
[1:24:27] <%kyh9> I like Zaeed's quotes about missions
[1:24:34] <tattleworm> she'll comment on your recent missions though if you check in with her after them
[1:24:36] <%heartlesshealer> gotta have her ouran high school host club
[1:24:41] <peachy996> OMEGA!
[1:24:43] <HaroldDonchee> man paige should have been around for backbone
[1:24:45] <+trackles_64> loading screms super quick
[1:24:46] <TourettesPlays> Kasumi stole my heart <3 <3

[1:24:53] <jorniev> time for zeeed
[1:24:54] <chimeraxmachina> Nah she’s stealing HEARTS
[1:24:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Zaeed and Kasumi don't have dialogue wheels but they have an absurd amount of dialogue interrupts in missions. If you want to hear about them you have to take them with you.
[1:24:59] <DatAsuna> Kasumi is the only character who figures it out if you pick morinth
[1:24:59] <%Papa_Bearman> Look at all that shit you gotta do!
[1:25:00] <Essixian> @falyden What if a single crack appeared in the window while you were looking at it but nothing else happens the entire time you're on the ship
[1:25:07] <xhodocto385> SourPls
[1:25:07] <+MightyDuckShoes> That's so unnatural. She should say some thing less obvious. Like "Can you leave? I need to go take a shit!"
[1:25:08] <%heartlesshealer> zeeeeed
[1:25:09] <%Raiden_Breaker> TIME TO SHOW OMEGA YOUR MOVES
[1:25:12] <%Nekros4442> We getting the boy?

[1:26:47] <Broken_Sonex> @hat_under_bread GOTTA GET RIGHT IN THERE
[1:26:47] <rekinom> rekinom subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Play LISA!
[1:26:47] <$LightningLynx89> Remember guys, it's okay to be racist to Batarians
[1:26:48] <xhodocto385> the ugliest aliens in the franchise everyone
[1:26:50] <%LumberjackJack> Stop being racist, Tired Shepard
[1:26:51] <%Dfreddy8> More like BUTARIANS
[1:26:54] <zerointelligence000> I'm sorry but Batarians are just so hideous
[1:26:58] <LluthyY> kill the batarian before he can commit a terrorism
[1:27:00] <Dunmarkh> that's a bit on the nose
[1:27:02] <SaltyAzteca> FAIR
[1:27:03] <%Papa_Bearman> Afterlife is licensed music, Pat.  Careful.

[1:27:06] <%kyh9> WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A BATARIAN PARTY MEMBER
[1:27:07] <chimeraxmachina> Fargut....that sounds familiar....
[1:27:08] <%MidnightBurst12> he's not wrong
[1:27:09] <i_chevalier> that's fair
[1:27:11] <jorniev> NAH
[1:27:14] <AluxStreams> To be fair Shepard used to openly hate Batarians 2 years ago.
[1:27:16] <xhodocto385> a batarian spells danger anytime
[1:27:17] <%derpy_platypus> All batarians are fuckwads
[1:27:17] <HaroldDonchee> dude it feels like shepherd looks worse every time I see him
[1:27:18] <Teras_ode> that's true
[1:27:19] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Music Pat?
[1:27:20] <$LightningLynx89> Quarantine warnings!? Uh oh.

[1:27:29] <FassieFons> he has a point..... FOR A BATARIAN
[1:27:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> It doesn't make sense at all with Shepard's origins.
[1:27:32] <peachy996> It's especially funny after you do Jack's mission then go here
[1:27:33] <James_Quivers> Good first impression
[1:27:33] <Essixian> I LIKE HIM ALREADY

[1:28:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> @HaroldDonchee He's DLC.
[1:28:52] <%Nekros4442> The most understandable motivation
[1:28:53] <+D00msDayDan> even if he didn't do it, he's a batarian so he deserves it
[1:28:54] <Teras_ode> Zaeed a better wrex than grunt

[1:29:38] <%Papa_Bearman> LEAVE MIRANDA ALONE.
[1:29:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Grunt is Meant to be your Son
[1:29:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> I like how you can tell Zaeed's nose has been broken before.

[1:29:56] <%Ipsenscastle> big goddamn heroes
[1:29:58] <Too_Much_Nukie> "Battlemaster" is how Krogans say "mommy"

[1:29:59] <Dunmarkh> based
[1:29:59] <%Dfreddy8> And Tali your little sister
[1:30:00] <SaltyAzteca> They always run

[1:30:10] <%kyh9> Zaeed is actually cool
[1:30:11] <%justnathan18> Just a kneecap
[1:30:13] <+redthebaron> incredible scene
[1:30:13] <%CalderGaming> @s1rcuit yes, day one
[1:30:15] <DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt there's actually a unique ending to zaeed's loyalty that you can only get by doing it after the collector base. lol
[1:30:17] <%hat_under_bread> He seems very based though.
[1:30:18] <James_Quivers> He's a true ladies man
[1:30:19] <%machshop> that's fine
[1:30:19] <+flexin_apex> Nice shot
[1:30:19] <chimeraxmachina> Aw

[1:30:33] <Gorshum> Zaeed is a paragon of violence.
[1:30:33] <knight_verse> What are you talking about, he is the nicest.
[1:30:34] <+Shockrates20XX> Really Illusive Man? THIS guy?
[1:30:34] <%LumberjackJack> Kasumi and Zaeed are much better starting human companions than Ashley/Kaiden or Miranda/Jacob
[1:30:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can just change your party from the shuttle menu too Pat if you ever want to do that.
[1:30:35] <CatRidder> he is  the nicest
[1:30:36] <WolfFreed> hes not nice but he is honest
[1:30:36] <$Wafflum> Fuck the Batarians

[1:32:30] <SaltyAzteca> wheeeeeeee
[1:32:31] <%heartlesshealer> well yeah

[1:32:40] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Zaeed is even worse than an asshole, he's a scumbag
[1:32:43] <%Papa_Bearman> Look out the window when you eject the trash.
[1:32:43] <%derpy_platypus> "morally gray"
[1:32:44] <BlackStarAura> LOTS of missions where Zaeed was the only one that made it. Hint hint, wink wink
[1:32:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> He has a lot to talk about.
[1:32:45] <+bulletzok> Based
[1:32:45] <ScreamLord> @Too_Much_Nukie No, that's the M7. Which has infinite ammo
[1:32:45] <LluthyY> big asshole, but big cool
[1:32:49] <James_Quivers> Look at Jesse more
[1:32:50] <televisedrevolting> "I was the only one who lived so I got A TON OF CASH."
[1:32:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> Examin Jesse again.
[1:32:54] <knight_verse> You have to do his loyalty mission as soon as possible if you want to have the bedt chances at dping the paragon version.... just saying.
[1:32:54] <Teras_ode> fire your poop into space
[1:32:54] <%Varlinator> There goes Boo
[1:32:57] <xhodocto385> Zaaeed "hero" from another story
[1:33:05] <%ainzhelm> @too_much_nukie I think canonically that’s just the lancer
[1:33:06] <%kyh9> Zaeed fucks with Krogans
[1:33:09] <+leontalon> itsnt it incredibly irresponsible to space your trash
[1:33:14] <FassieFons> imagine having more character than the humans with actual dialogue trees
[1:33:16] <xhodocto385> blood pack?
[1:33:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Brutal
[1:33:17] <+TungstenViper> cynic too. amazing
[1:33:20] <+lukedu_> he's very badass
[1:33:21] <AluxStreams> I wish I had a grandpa like Zaeed.
[1:33:27] <%justnathan18> What did Zaeed do before alien space
[1:33:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> He's crazy
[1:33:29] <+cursedwithadhd> it's pretty amazing all these humans have these stories when humans only been in the galactic community for about 30 years
[1:33:30] <%HairballCT> jesus fuck that's horrifying
[1:33:34] <+Fooguwu> He's just Canderous Pat
[1:33:35] <xhodocto385> he survived the krogans PogChamp
[1:33:39] <TomFrancis_> nice A pose
[1:33:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @justnathan18 what didn't he do
[1:33:43] <+trackles_64> the avenger sucks
[1:33:44] <James_Quivers> Yes he does
[1:33:45] <%Raiden_Breaker> animation reset
[1:33:47] <$lumporr> :/
[1:33:49] <%heartlesshealer> zaeed reseting his pose mid-convo
[1:33:50] <HaroldDonchee> God I want to fuck that rifle again
[1:33:53] <+TungstenViper> i read "jessie's first kiss" LUL
[1:33:53] <%MidnightBurst12> ignore the stains on the gun
[1:33:54] <DatAsuna> never resighting it is actually pretty good, optics are way less durable than guns
[1:33:57] <xhodocto385> these space turtles are much hardier than humans
[1:34:02] <peachy996> Jesse is best Waifu, all other waifus cannot compare
[1:34:02] <Teras_ode> Is he a mandalorian?
[1:34:06] <%goose_attack_almanac> Sounds like that guy had shit shields
[1:34:07] <%king_wragles> What's with Space Van Dam?
[1:34:07] <SaltyAzteca> Get yourself a girl like Jessie
[1:34:08] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I didn't know there was more to his jessie story
[1:34:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> Oh he's crazier than you think Pat.
[1:34:13] <+abrupt_abe> a bit
[1:34:14] <%charp35> Man the me2 dlc characters are so nothing I constantly forget they exist
[1:34:14] <+redthebaron> it is wild that he talks about the gun in 3rd person
[1:34:18] <James_Quivers> I KILLED LITERALLY EVERYONE WITH THAT GUN, SHEPARD
[1:34:18] <+trackles_64> the gun made me do it
[1:34:22] <peachy996> Tali? loser. Liara? Don't make me laugh. Jesse above all
[1:34:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ThatGuyfromMars It's the best.
[1:34:24] <thetunnelhomer> I feel like this is a love letter to the old cooldown system
[1:34:24] <%heartlesshealer> might be based on Manadlor, unsure
[1:34:24] <homestylewaffles> I mean you're asking him about work when his job is killing people
[1:34:25] <mak0t0yukii> I KILL EVERYONE WITH THAT GUN
[1:34:25] <xhodocto385> old?
[1:34:26] <%MidnightBurst12> I assume most old mercs would be at least this crazy

[1:35:22] <%ThatGuyfromMars> he's certified
[1:35:23] <ScreamLord> See, Thermal Clip. Gun is 1-2 years old maximum. Everything before that has infinite ammo
[1:35:24] <%spartanghost004> rifle wife
[1:35:24] <TourettesPlays> its really confusing exactly when the galaxy went from cooldown weapons to ejectable clips
[1:35:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> That's really all you ever need to know about Zaeed.
[1:35:25] <%MidnightBurst12> I love this psycho

[1:35:27] <Teras_ode> BibleThump

[1:35:34] <%GinAndRoses> externalizing your violent psychosis onto a gun seems fine and normal
[1:35:35] <SaltyAzteca> Narrator : he goes crazy

[1:35:50] <alroy900> sounds like one of my schizophrenic bipolar uncle
[1:35:51] <James_Quivers> Same, says SHep
[1:35:52] <%ThatGuyfromMars> the lore they added to ME2 is what made Mass Effect from a pretty good series into a pretty great one
[1:35:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> Zaeed is arguably more insane than Canderous.
[1:35:54] <+capnbeefs> Jessie has more character than anyone in Andromeda
[1:35:54] <%machshop> PogChamp
[1:35:54] <AluxStreams> If you walk away during this he calls you to keep telling you the story.
[1:35:58] <Too_Much_Nukie> But he's that trope.

[1:36:35] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> does he mean the shell?
[1:36:35] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Too_Much_Nukie at least Canderous had a reason to be who he was, Zaeed is just crazy for money
[1:36:37] <AngryAsian5> He's a mercenary. Killing shit is his modus operandi. Of course he's fuckin nuts.
[1:36:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[1:36:40] <%ainzhelm> The illusive man is big on forgetting his key motivations
[1:36:41] <%toolofparanoia> OH BOY HERE HE GOES KILLING AGAIN
[1:36:41] <xhodocto385> this one decapitated many Krogans
[1:36:42] <%MisterRockett> That sounds like peeling finger nails off and scalping them at the same time.
[1:36:42] <thetunnelhomer> Humans are still Space Orcs
[1:36:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> IF YOU SCALP KROGANS THEY HATE IT SHEPARD! BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW.
[1:36:54] <Broken_Sonex> HE FUCKING SCALPS KROGANS
[1:36:55] <%Papa_Bearman> His voice actor was the same guy who played Ethan Rayne in 'Buffy'.  So good.
[1:36:57] <Pookiedaexzile> He's what people who kill for a living sound like

[1:49:29] <%Dfreddy8> ONE GUY
[1:49:29] <peachy996> It was just that one line
[1:49:30] <%animaturgy> psa1guy
[1:49:30] <%justnathan18> Aria has the biggest weiner
[1:49:32] <shotgang86> ONE GUY
[1:49:32] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Her voice had one in-game
[1:49:33] <+Toshatron> she had reverb on her voice
[1:49:33] <HaroldDonchee> shepherd could fucking destroy this whole place. calm down blue girl
[1:49:33] <Zebroneath> sounds fine
[1:49:35] <%Ipsenscastle> there was one line with dramatic echo
[1:49:35] <%Rumbutt> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[1:49:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> When she yells she creates an echo in the audio itself
[1:49:35] <+JaseAdrift> woolieONEGUY
[1:49:36] <cgreene64> I don't remember Pat Sheppard looking this rough last stream
[1:49:36] <%knight1210> one guy
[1:49:37] <Dunmarkh> batarian one guy
[1:49:37] <+ThomasOfTroy> Because she echoed for that one dramatic moment
[1:49:38] <SaltyAzteca> That was for when Aria pronounced she was Omega
[1:49:38] <Too_Much_Nukie> Because when she says "I AM OMEGA" there's an echo.
[1:49:38] <%Ranryu692> Aria's voice echoed when she said "I am Omega"
[1:49:38] <mak0t0yukii> ONE DUDE
[1:49:38] <+NobuuNobuu> echo
[1:49:39] <+lukedu_> she's an Asari, kill her pat
[1:49:40] <+Shockrates20XX> I think it's in the game.
[1:49:40] <+Ancopro> i think it was the one line
[1:49:42] <+vaderxyz1970> music maybe?
[1:49:44] <%dekkitout> They meant when she said she was omega
[1:49:46] <jorniev> because aria had reverb in that one line?
[1:49:55] <awalbaru> The guy certainly have 2 streams opened in tabs
[1:49:56] <stantheman_97> because of the "i am omega" line
[1:50:00] <alroy900> pretty sure the echo was her
[1:50:02] <CatRidder> music sounds shity
[1:50:02] <+lukedu_> what's with her expressions? LUL
[1:50:04] <Mr_JustinJones> Whats wrong with your face girl
[1:50:05] <%JohnAtDawn> DAT ASS
[1:50:06] <%AncelDeLambert> she's only the baddest bitch this side of the hub
[1:50:11] <+Shockrates20XX> wait a minute...who ARE you?
[1:50:11] <Teras_ode> the echo was the one line Aria made, it's supposed to be like that
[1:50:16] <$dalmek> but what about among......
[1:50:18] <xhodocto385> LUL MEGA this
[1:50:19] <$dalmek> us?
[1:50:20] <+vaderxyz1970> why are we talking to here
[1:50:20] <James_Quivers> She's very dramatic
[1:50:23] <%condemned_15> I was joking about Arias voice echoing for no reason
[1:50:26] <%Varlinator> That changes later on
[1:50:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Drama at 12
[1:50:42] <xhodocto385> because aliens make echo voices Kappa
[1:50:43] <%Raiden_Breaker> Shepard trying not to show flag full mast
[1:50:44] <%Monkeyweed21> LOOK AT HER DANCING BEHIND YOU
[1:50:48] <TourettesPlays> "As stupid as it sounds, it could even have been a clone Shepard"
[1:50:51] <+vaderxyz1970> why 3rd person
[1:50:51] <+titansloth93> wonder if Asari like watching Asari strippers or or if it's just for other species
[1:50:53] <dd44dostivei> aria, can i have your playlist?
[1:50:58] <%AncelDeLambert> Who is this Archangel? I've heard he's cool and doesn't afraid of anything
[1:50:59] <+flexin_apex> Burn
[1:51:00] <peachy996> Archangel seems like a hot turian. I mean...What?
[1:51:08] <%Ipsenscastle> Archangel seems like a cool and sexy guy with a handsome bird face
[1:51:09] <SaltyAzteca> The robin hood of Omega
[1:51:12] <%justnathan18> Aria is very "hardass in 2010"
[1:51:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> I bet Archangel is some kind of super bro that I could hang out with.
[1:51:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Her Face Paint does point to Turian
[1:51:24] <%BarujaraciGaming> I just had a fart that turned in to not a fart. almost didn't catch it
[1:51:28] <+vaderxyz1970> Omega is Omega make Omega Omega Again
[1:51:30] <TourettesPlays> @titansloth93 I assume no because of their bigotry towards purebloods
[1:51:31] <%ainzhelm> @PatStaresAt YOU GOTTA GO BAIL OUT BATMAN

[2:07:14] <%justnathan18> Vorcha are kinda cool though. Like they dont evolve as a species because they can adapt individually as a species.

[2:08:51] <GohansBeforeHohans> Mordin heals him
[2:08:51] <%QueequegTheater> You get the cure at the end
[2:08:51] <Jane_Lo> yeah, he does, i think it cures automatically
[2:08:51] <$RealThiele> FAKE PLAGUE, HOAX FROM SPACE CHINA
[2:08:51] <SaltyAzteca> Yo holy crap
[2:08:51] <LordOfThePoultry> yep

[2:08:53] <%spartanghost004> he slowly starts to die
[2:08:53] <+abrupt_abe> Yea
[2:08:54] <+Shockrates20XX> He coughs
[2:08:54] <$Faustgesicht> Yeah Mordin just cures it
[2:08:55] <%JamesCorck> It does nothing and Mordin heals him.
[2:08:55] <+Buzzkill983> Mordin gives him Pfizer Vaccine
[2:08:55] <%HairballCT> wait how did space karen leave her apartment in the first place
[2:08:55] <Dragovus> Mordin cures him
[2:08:55] <$Memdosu> nothing, mordin cures it
[2:08:56] <%Papa_Bearman> Yep, with the push of a button.
[2:08:57] <%zyberion626> yeah all alien crew members start coughing
[2:08:58] <Too_Much_Nukie> Mordin cures it at the end of the mission. But you get unique dialogue.
[2:08:59] <%JamesCorck> Yeah Garrus will be fine.
[2:09:00] <Basch71> he basically just has unique dialogue
[2:09:00] <%BappoTheMighty> @PatStaresAt idk if it was brought up already, but are you doing a renegade run or sticking with paragon?
[2:09:01] <Teras_ode> all non humans get plague dialogue
[2:09:05] <%JamesCorck> It's actually a very funny moment,
[2:09:06] <Hairy_butts> he gets a cough and fever in the zone and mordin gives him a booster
[2:09:08] <+destro_223> Mordin is the best
[2:09:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> But you're not going in a grid.
[2:09:11] <GohansBeforeHohans> Any alien you bring on this mission gets the plague and mordin helps them
[2:09:13] <%Varlinator> It's worth it for the extra dialogue
[2:09:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's a straight line.
[2:09:14] <+Listerines3> Being able to recruit in any order also opens up fun stuff like being a monster and bringing Thane.
[2:09:14] <thebalticguy1> You passed a merchant while doing the grid tho
[2:09:15] <$RealThiele> like the borg
[2:09:16] <ape_hawk> guys, pat played this game a bunch
[2:09:18] <Owlboy7> grunt also gets the plague there
[2:09:19] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Let Pat be Pat you fucks
[2:09:20] <DatAsuna> grunt gets hungry, but also catches it
[2:09:22] <+flexin_apex> I never knew that
[2:09:24] <peachy996> Grunt coughs and says "I DO NOT GET SICK"
[2:09:25] <xhodocto385> REPENT
[2:09:25] <%Ranryu692> not a very good grid if you're walking past stuff you haven't done
[2:09:27] <%ainzhelm> Fucking cigar smoking Elcor
[2:09:27] <LluthyY> Thats awesome, bad but awesome lol
[2:09:28] <Pookiedaexzile> He's playing the game in a grid he has not explained

[2:29:28] <thebalticguy1> @PatStaresAt Jack is actually not bad in ME 3
[2:29:28] <%ainzhelm> And then grunt makes fun of jack for being small
[2:29:28] <Pookiedaexzile> We get no cool Dialogue for Garrus now during his mission
[2:29:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> needs more calibrations
[2:29:29] <SaltyAzteca> democracy wins again
[2:29:29] <%justnathan18> Jack is like if Hellboy's girlfriend went to the Warped Tour.
[2:29:30] <$Memdosu> If you hate jack u never actually talked to jack
[2:29:32] <+King_floppy> Jack's great EFF the haters.
[2:29:32] <thetunnelhomer> Remember when Garrus was suppose to be a surprise?

[2:29:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TurtlesAndTentacles i fuckin love pumpkin spice and you can't stop me
[2:29:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> Garrus is the coolest party member but the Grunt dialogue you get is actually cool and rare to see.
[2:29:47] <%BappoTheMighty> Oh okay.
[2:29:47] <+Maleicus> did pat mod in garrus broromance
[2:29:49] <brisk_dacat> Fake news the polls are rigged

[2:29:56] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Jack is only good in ME3
[2:29:57] <%ComfortableStranger> Jack is an edgelady
[2:29:57] <tattleworm> she's cool in 3, honestly
[2:29:58] <%Varlinator> At least now we get the extra dialogue with Garrus when we go to Mordin's
[2:29:59] <jorniev> @TurtlesAndTentacles THEN IM THE BASICEST SPICEST PUMPKIMEST BITCH EVER
[2:29:59] <ScreamLord> Grunt has unique dialogue in Garrus' mission
[2:30:00] <%Monkeyweed21> new shotty
[2:30:00] <%Raiden_Breaker> is grunt worst krogan party member
[2:30:00] <%DracosMagala> U hate Jack??
[2:30:00] <thebalticguy1> ADD SHOTGUN
[2:30:02] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt But it's very funny to watch chat get angry about Jack
[2:30:03] <Pookiedaexzile> He hates jack because she knows the peepee is small
[2:30:03] <%WutangchickeN> jack was such a 2007 character...
[2:30:04] <$Memdosu> She becomes normal tho
[2:30:04] <%Ipsenscastle> LUL
[2:30:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can change guns before every mission Pat.
[2:30:12] <thebalticguy1> You could do it from that menu?
[2:30:12] <%ainzhelm> YOU CAN DO THAT BEFORE EVERY MISSION PAT
[2:30:13] <xhodocto385> KKona how it is a rigged poll?, Garrus is our husbando
[2:30:15] <ketchuo13> Geth shotgun so OP
[2:30:19] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @cobalt_phoenix_ STOP IT. NO PUMPKIN
[2:30:19] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> Jack is great in ME3
[2:30:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> The game stops you to let you change party and weapons.
[2:30:21] <+Daigrey> you can change when you leave
[2:30:21] <ScreamLord> Also Armor
[2:30:25] <tattleworm> stats?
[2:30:25] <%derpy_platypus> dildo gun
[2:30:25] <iosephe> Stats?
[2:30:25] <%Ipsenscastle> you could've changed them in that screen
[2:30:25] <%Dfreddy8> You do it our of the Normandy anyway every time
[2:30:25] <$Futurecity10> The lower it is, the better it is
[2:30:29] <%Ranryu692> yeah, it's terrible
[2:30:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> That's because every gun behaves differently.
[2:30:30] <%dekkitout> Y no statz?
[2:30:31] <buhbuhboat> Jack's fine, she sucks on Insanity tho so I never end up using her lol
[2:30:32] <thebalticguy1> @PatStaresAt you can do that before every mission
[2:30:32] <%zyberion626> you can set loadout when you set out for a mission @PatStaresAt
[2:30:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Jack is horrible in ME3
[2:30:36] <peachy996> Blackstorm
[2:30:36] <%ComfortableStranger> just remember to take Jack on Miranda's loyalty mission for added hilarity
[2:30:41] <%bassoontyphoon> Bad Dragon Shotgun
[2:30:43] <%JamesCorck> Pat you can change your guns when you start the mission to get Garrus.
[2:30:43] <James_Quivers> The main difference is in how they play
[2:30:48] <thebalticguy1> MATTOCK IS BETTER
[2:30:52] <Alzero83> Use the CAIN @PatStaresAt
[2:30:52] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Don't forget your armor
[2:30:52] <%justnathan18> Jack is the Shadow the Hedgehog of Mass Effect
[2:30:53] <stormhawk9891> All you need to know is that Eviscerator is best shotty
[2:30:53] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @jorniev HOW DARE YOU.
[2:30:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> The Geth Plasma Shotgun is barely a shotgun. More like a mega buster in function.
[2:30:54] <Profmcstevie> Damage Numbers: PrideShrug
[2:30:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TurtlesAndTentacles psaDab psaDab psaDab
[2:30:55] <tattleworm> geth shotgun's weird, it charges
[2:30:56] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> MATTOCK
[2:30:56] <%ComfortableStranger> Cain>blackstorm
[2:30:57] <%ainzhelm> Because every gun functions differently and ammo mods are applied powers this time
[2:30:57] <+Buzzkill983> Geth Shotgun and Mattock are so good
[2:30:59] <Vantesla> stats. they are there, but not viewable.
[2:31:01] <%Varlinator> Stats are for nerds - In this game, it's all about the feeeeeeel
[2:31:08] <Alzero83> CAIN is a straight up nuke @PatStaresAt
[2:31:10] <SaltyAzteca> Lets go get best wingman
[2:31:10] <xhodocto385> one question, did Ashley die in the last game Kappa ?
[2:31:13] <$Futurecity10> The Cain is amazing
[2:31:15] <%JamesCorck> Krogan shotty is best shotty.
[2:31:16] <thebalticguy1> @PatStaresAt You can change equipment at this screen
[2:31:17] <ScreamLord> He forgot his armor
[2:31:17] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat kasumi's loyalty mission gives the best submachine gun (of which there are only 3) in the game
[2:31:19] <jorniev> THAT RIFLE IS MY FAVORITE GUN IN THE GAME
[2:31:20] <+Daigrey> geth shotgun is ranged and based
[2:31:21] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> Man this is the first time I've ever managed to catch a stream live.
[2:31:26] <+Buzzkill983> Damage of a shotgun, range/accuracy of a rifle. I love it
[2:31:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Geth Shotgun has a charge shot. Try shooting it like a semi-auto and also holding it.
[2:31:29] <buhbuhboat> @xhodocto385 you know it
[2:31:29] <TioXyco> you can charge the geth shotgun
[2:31:31] <tattleworm> it's good, i just don't think it works for a vanguard
[2:31:31] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> It's because RPGs are ewwy gross and for nerds. Bioware is too cool for numbers
[2:31:31] <xhodocto385> i hope Kaidan lived
[2:31:32] <thetunnelhomer> I think Geth Shotgun lets you charge up shots
[2:31:42] <FassieFons> default humans gtfo
[2:31:42] <%sunsetdisc0> geth plasma shottie is the best its basically a long range shotgun
[2:31:44] <%justnathan18> Kaiden lived.
[2:31:46] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @cobalt_phoenix_ psaDown psaDown psaBougie psaBougie psaBougie psaPat psaPat psaPat
[2:31:47] <xhodocto385> buhbuhboat i wasn't here at the time
[2:31:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's really weird.
[2:31:52] <%KetsuoTaberu> yup it's quite good
[2:31:55] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> Geth shotgun was a monster in the multiplayer
[2:31:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Katsumi: Crime is good tho Zaheed: He shot good Well thanks for adding to this missions story with your unique flavor
[2:31:59] <%JoshManVGH> @thetunnelhomer It's also got a pretty long range!
[2:32:02] <ScreamLord> Kestler Armor is the best armor by far
[2:32:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TurtlesAndTentacles LUL
[2:32:07] <%ainzhelm> Wasnt the geth shotgun a big meta weapon for ME3 multiplayer platinum?
[2:32:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> I prefer the geth shotgun for my party members but the claymore for myself.
[2:32:10] <%ComfortableStranger> the bolts will home in, at least they do in me3
[2:32:11] <jorniev> GOD TAHT RIFLE I LOVE IT SO MUCH
[2:32:11] <thebalticguy1> GPS has 3 long range plasma bolts
[2:32:15] <dd44dostivei> mattock rifle is disgustingly OP
[2:32:16] <+Buzzkill983> Geth Shotgun rocks really well with your squadmates, makes them super accurate
[2:32:18] <xhodocto385> good that Kaidan lived, ashley was so unbearable
[2:32:20] <+skeletonmilk> this music sounds like spoon
[2:32:26] <%bread_assassin> For all the story faults, ME3 ramps up the RPG elements. Guns have visible stats again, you can mod them.
[2:32:31] <Vantesla> Geth Shotgun is amazing. can charge shotgun, then Vanguard charge to unload immediately on a poor for. LUL
[2:32:33] <tattleworm> yeah, vanguard's gotta rock the claymore, them's the rules
[2:32:38] <%Nekros4442> 500 credits seems like pretty shit pay
[2:32:39] <%ainzhelm> Did they make that batarians face fatter?
[2:32:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> This guy calls you a stripper if you're femshep.
[2:32:43] <SaltyAzteca> Awwwwww
[2:32:45] <+trackles_64> I cant collect my friends share, lame
[2:32:46] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> @ainzhelm Absolutely, shit absolutely melted enemies.
[2:32:52] <arkv01> NO healthcare for you
[2:32:53] <xhodocto385> Blue Suns? Firefly?
[2:33:00] <%Ravioli_Ronin> “I wanna smooch archangel to death, yeah”
[2:33:02] <SaltyAzteca> Quick Intermission
[2:33:04] <mak0t0yukii> 1
[2:33:07] <%MassConnect> how much was the fornax again?
[2:33:07] <feralspidey> going from one club mix to another...
[2:33:11] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Fucking gang intern
[2:33:15] <%GalacticaPhanto> God there so many Firefly references in this game I almost forgot
[2:33:24] <%Ipsenscastle> okay it's laaate. Night chat!
[2:33:26] <%ComfortableStranger> @xhodocto385 Kal reegar is Jane, so maybe
[2:33:27] <peachy996> I have a question "How do you smooch a turian?"
[2:33:29] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> @MassConnect simultaneously too much and too little
[2:33:33] <tinytinykittycat> I like how bored the recruiter sounded
[2:33:39] <xhodocto385> yeah comfy
[2:33:48] <%Dfreddy8> psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab
[2:34:03] <%MassConnect> sounds like it doesn't pay enough to buy a magazine
[2:34:05] <+some_random_variable> psaRaffle
[2:34:05] <Vantesla> @tattleworm Claymore is overrated and I don't care what others say. it's not as fun to a charged gethshotgun. Everyone has their favorites though SeemsGood
[2:34:14] <xhodocto385> one thing, if life in the universe is real do you think they are gonna look all eldritch and abstract nonhumanoids? WutFace
[2:34:24] <TioXyco> @tinytinykittycat when you have to repeat the same thing over a hundred times in the spam of a few hours, it's understarndable
[2:34:26] <peachy996> For ME3 MP I was always partial towards the Piranha
[2:34:31] <%justnathan18> @tinytinykittycat To be fair he had been recruting those mercs for DAYS
[2:34:31] <muXPerience> everyone recced claymore like it would be another berserk
[2:34:38] <peachy996> It's like the Striker from RE4
[2:34:46] <%ainzhelm> @peachy996 same. And the hurricane
[2:34:50] <%ComfortableStranger> @Vantesla I use a choked wraith
[2:35:01] <stormhawk9891> @muXPerience It's all about the Eviscerator anyway
[2:35:07] <xhodocto385> even with convergent evolutions, aliens would never be human-shaped
[2:35:18] <peachy996> Oh and the Batarian Gun
[2:35:23] <%ainzhelm> You could solo the Rio map on platinum by just abusing that shipping container. Would run volus with hurricane
[2:35:24] <tattleworm> in me3 i used the revolver barrel thing, that shreded, but me2's claymore funtimes
[2:35:26] <%Papa_Bearman> What song is this?  I must have it.
[2:35:29] <%Varlinator> N7 Crusader for me
[2:35:33] <Profmcstevie> Being bipedal rocks but also fucking sucks as an evolution choice
[2:35:37] <peachy996> Graal Spike Thrower was neat too but I don't know if it was very good in MP
[2:35:40] <%ComfortableStranger> @peachy996 the kishook harpoon gun?
[2:35:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Papa_Bearman Bottom right of the screen dude
[2:35:51] <%ComfortableStranger> or the graal
[2:35:51] <peachy996> Yeah the Kishock
[2:35:52] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> @Papa_Bearman "Jank Jonk," says on the screen.
[2:35:53] <xhodocto385> being bipedal means you keep falling all the time LUL
[2:36:01] <$ZeOrbling> Where round man go?
[2:36:04] <%doctordinkus> is that the time crisis reload voice?
[2:36:16] <%ainzhelm> Fucking ME4 better have a volus squadmate
[2:36:17] <%Papa_Bearman> Hey, don't get smart with me; I don't look at the SCREEN.
[2:36:25] <+trackles_64> How long is pat streaming today?
[2:36:30] <%ComfortableStranger> @peachy996 I used the graal in plat all the time, has innated armor bypass and charged does tons of damage
[2:36:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> Clearly
[2:36:33] <tattleworm> also inferno ammo + reegar carbine for funsies
[2:36:36] <%ainzhelm> You cant let us play as them and then treat them like they cant fight
[2:36:41] <xhodocto385> ME4 should have Hanar romance, where are my eldritch dating sims Kappa
[2:36:48] <%Dfreddy8> What a good boy.
[2:36:51] <%heartlesshealer> =T

[2:37:23] <stormhawk9891> Apparently the Inscisor sniper is pretty good if you stick it on your teammates
[2:37:25] <Profmcstevie> First he wounds her hand, now he removes her tissues. This is sabotage
[2:37:26] <%ComfortableStranger> @tattleworm combine with warp for OP fun

[2:45:05] <CatRidder> big PATRGON
[2:45:06] <fugly_nick> Oh no, now it;s just a ME1 gun
[2:45:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah the prompts should almost always just be taken.
[2:45:19] <TourettesPlays> @peachy996 and breaks just as fucking easily
[2:45:21] <+trackles_64> it sparks when he hits it tho
[2:45:21] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt No you break it, he says as much in a mail you get after
[2:45:23] <$RealThiele> you have zero power here
[2:45:24] <Pookiedaexzile> No he breaks it
[2:45:24] <%luftraumm1> pargon pargon pargon
[2:45:25] <%emperordread> oh I thought he just slapped it's shit and sparks flew out of it
[2:45:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> all this time i though he was showing how cheap and bad quality it was lol
[2:45:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SovPho Paragon is "Good is not Nice"
[2:45:29] <Profmcstevie> He stole my magazine
[2:45:30] <dd44dostivei> take every prompt
[2:45:30] <%SataruYamate> i thought the gun was just busted and it wasy to tell for an experienced soldier
[2:45:32] <plaguedoctor_syan> besides 50 credits? that thing is probally defect
[2:45:33] <$Faustgesicht> I always thought he was showing it was jammed or busted
[2:45:39] <+flexin_apex> He did the training day thing
[2:45:42] <%ainzhelm> shuriken is garbage anyway
[2:45:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah he breaks it to show that someone sold him a piece of shit gun that doesn't work.
[2:45:44] <%zyberion626> cheap batarian gun
[2:45:53] <SneakyCorpse> @Faustgesicht agreed
[2:45:58] <jorniev> god he has the black hole gun
[2:45:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Faustgesicht he is showing its a piece of shit by just giving it a simple tap
[2:45:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Its like cracking the plastic on a gun
[2:46:05] <%UvBenServed> *Breaks gun* "Go get you money back"
[2:46:07] <peachy996> Stand in Archangel's sight
[2:46:10] <+wizard_of_diamonds> One of my favorite renegade options coming up
[2:46:11] <%justnathan18> This is the one time id bring Jacob for extra firepower
[2:46:17] <Oxybe> for 50 credits it was probably just an angry pipe with a cheap capacitor welded onto it.
[2:46:21] <%ComfortableStranger> he got the gun form Borris the Blade
[2:46:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> Some kind of handsome sniper bro?
[2:46:24] <%bassoontyphoon> Hype for kasumis combat skillz
[2:46:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> Who hates authority?
[2:46:30] <dd44dostivei> shepard looks like he has a matrix hole
[2:46:30] <BlackStarAura> “You’re working too hard!”
[2:46:35] <%doctordinkus> kasumi? poochie from persona 5 is in this??
[2:46:35] <knight_verse> Pat's about to suffer real bad when he gets to the hideouts basement.
[2:46:37] <%luftraumm1> you running with the dlc murder hobo character?
[2:46:38] <cgreene64> I like how Shepard is deterring this human from throwing himself at Archangel, but won't do the same for the aliens 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
[2:46:38] <%ainzhelm> Even though we have hover cars
[2:46:39] <$RealThiele> hes so hot people are dying to meet him
[2:47:01] <%ComfortableStranger> @doctordinkus except the game predates p5
[2:47:07] <%ainzhelm> Youll be fine
[2:47:07] <%justnathan18> @cgreene64 To be fair, with humans you can tell how old they are
[2:47:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt If you do this recruitment mission after Mordin/Jack/Grunt they don't change the dialogue but it makes it pretty fucking funny that Garrus was just sitting here all that time sniping people.
[2:47:11] <Parapattern> "Yeah, I guess it is."
[2:47:13] <Hellarussian> just save wave after wave of cannon fodder until they run out of ammo. Brilliant
[2:47:14] <HaroldDonchee> you look good at dying
[2:47:15] <thebalticguy1> @PatStaresAt Zaeed has unique dialogue with the blue suns commander!!
[2:47:15] <Profmcstevie> Suicide? brush it off
[2:47:18] <FassieFons> we can totally handle suicide
[2:47:20] <%luftraumm1> old murder hobo + poochie DLC characters
[2:47:22] <%Varlinator> Zaeed loves suicide
[2:47:25] <spawnzie> you can handle dying
[2:47:31] <fugly_nick> Suicide is badass
[2:47:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah he knows Balticguy.
[2:47:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> THERE IS NO ZANGIEF ONLY THE GIEF
[2:47:44] <+destro_223> cannon fodder
[2:47:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> It was talked about last stream.
[2:47:46] <jorniev> come on man we need you to make that extra effort to get that game out on time, you look like you can do it!
[2:47:51] <%RAWPowerStudios> Did you say "Not for fucking"
[2:47:53] <%Dfreddy8> What a good doggo
[2:47:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> Zaeed and Grunt both have extra scenes here.
[2:47:58] <knight_verse> One dude has been holding back all of the mercenaries, they should be ashamed
[2:47:58] <peachy996> Suicide is meh but GUDDAMN Suicide now Zaeed is hyped
[2:47:59] <%doctordinkus> one guy

[2:48:28] <AngryAsian5> Sounds like this Archangel guy has the biggest dick on Omega LUL
[2:48:33] <ToneBacas> should have exposed Gief to more batarians when he was a puppy
[2:48:37] <%justnathan18> Why not just send in everyone at once
[2:48:37] <%ainzhelm> "What are we. some kind of suicide squad"?
[2:48:38] <mak0t0yukii> PAT THE BABY

[2:49:09] <%Maids4lyfe> they can't get enough
[2:49:16] <cgreene64> @mattais88 most people in the game don't like humans actually Kappa
[2:49:24] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Kasumi is life
[2:49:24] <peachy996> Archangel will give you a love tap
[2:49:25] <%ComfortableStranger> Batarians have 4 eyes, but can they see the reason why kids love cinnamon toast crunch?

[3:01:42] <AngryAsian5> A Turian eh?
[3:01:45] <+Buzzkill983> Funny thing is, If at birth you teach Vorcha science they become really good scientists. They pretty adapt super hard to the one thing you teach them at birth

[3:04:11] <D3dshotCalamity> @ComfortableStranger he founded them
[3:04:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> Suspicious!
[3:04:14] <akitanito> super glossy lips

[3:04:27] <thetunnelhomer> Zaeed has a Blue Suns logo tattooed on his neck. I legit didn't see it till now.
[3:04:31] <James_Quivers> Yeah, you don't get this convo unless you bring Zaeed
[3:04:32] <mak0t0yukii> Your plan Sucks
[3:04:35] <SovPho> snitch on both of them to the other so they do the opposite plan and nothing happens boom 5d chess world peace
[3:04:38] <Too_Much_Nukie> @BlackStarAura Yeah this is why people wanted him to go get Grunt and then bring Grunt and Zaeed here. They get unique dialogue for this mission that most people have never seen.
[3:04:47] <%MidnightBurst12> he's gotta poop eventually
[3:04:48] <+MrAtheGreat> 1: KILL THE HELP 2: RUN 3: ???? 4: PROFIT

[3:04:56] <BlackStarAura> Yeah, I usually do this mission with Miranda & Mordin
[3:04:56] <+ezlo_86> with the Incisor sniper

[3:04:58] <DSD24> @TourettesPlays I went Infiltrator for my original playthough, so this new one I went Vanguard Its hype as fuck!
[3:05:00] <+trackles_64> he makes the  bad people upset
[3:05:00] <%Varlinator> Love that people didn't know about that convo. It's why this game is 11/10 for replayability
[3:05:03] <%Dakuu75> She has the least-weird face I've seen so far
[3:05:04] <+MrAtheGreat> Is this turian BATMAN
[3:05:07] <%Torus1025> @sovpho Ready in just five minutes

[3:15:01] <+Punchasaur> Hell no it’s not Ashley
[3:15:01] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> God I love charge with shotty
[3:15:05] <%machshop> it do
[3:15:06] <%ainzhelm> We dont have time to deal with this idiot. CHARGE
[3:15:09] <+ezlo_86> if you charge it does
[3:15:09] <%ComfortableStranger> @destro_223 its OP in me2, sucks horribly in me3
[3:15:10] <sweatch0> woah
[3:15:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> It is very long range.
[3:15:11] <+Dreadknight297> Yeah,its very good.
[3:15:11] <%MugenSandan> Oh boy guys who could this Archangel figure POSSIBLY be?
[3:15:11] <deviljhojho_> THE shotgun
[3:15:12] <DatAsuna> we told you yeah
[3:15:12] <%42nfl19> Is that just a slug round?
[3:15:12] <%KetsuoTaberu> yup
[3:15:13] <James_Quivers> DLC weapons are all great
[3:15:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> I told you it's weird.
[3:15:16] <AmuserName> Very long range, AND you can hold it to charge the power.
[3:15:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's not a shotgun.
[3:15:19] <buhbuhboat> elmo tail
[3:15:19] <%templar010> Oh Dude the Geth Shotgun is fucking busted
[3:15:20] <+ezlo_86> charge it all the way
[3:15:20] <%Varlinator> IT'S THE BEST SHOTGUN
[3:15:21] <%sunsetdisc0> yeah man! long range shotgun
[3:15:22] <sweatch0> where did you get that??
[3:15:22] <+Buzzkill983> It's the best. You can even use it like a rifle
[3:15:24] <%templar010> Charge that shit
[3:15:25] <%JamesCorck> That shotty's borderline a sniper rifle.
[3:15:26] <+critikal_bit> Yeah the Geth shotgun is SUPER good
[3:15:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Its great but it sounds horrible
[3:15:29] <%cha0tic_klutch> And bullets follow targets
[3:15:29] <akitanito> just make every shot count
[3:15:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> This is just a rifle the game calls a shotgun.
[3:15:30] <AmuserName> AND IT HAS MILD HOMING, like the Halo Needler
[3:15:34] <%ainzhelm> @PatStaresAt ME3 Multiplayer meta weawpon
[3:15:35] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt That is like the equivalent to slug rounds in a double barrel
[3:15:37] <Profmcstevie> man if the geth ran this in ME1 we'd get rocked
[3:15:37] <%JamesCorck> It's also quite precise.
[3:15:38] <$RealThiele> thats what the charge is for
[3:15:39] <%Varlinator> psaBig DAMAGE
[3:15:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> MEGA BUSTER
[3:15:40] <peachy996> So cool
[3:15:41] <mak0t0yukii> it's a CHARGE GUN
[3:15:42] <%rkbinder> 3
[3:15:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Technically its not a VIDEOGAME shotgun
[3:15:45] <+destro_223> good range, but not the best with ammo powers
[3:15:45] <%OldOnyx> 3
[3:15:49] <%Dakuu75> double barrel shotgun. dudes
[3:15:50] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I fucking LOVE the geth shotty
[3:15:51] <%Shubreaker> you can hold the shotgun charge before you biotic charge and lay waste
[3:15:52] <%templar010> That gun -fucks-
[3:15:55] <Mattais88> Hey Pat, are you going to pick up the super shotgun later or get a proper rifle instead?
[3:15:58] <%emperordread> This is why the Geth gotta go, they mislabel their guns
[3:16:00] <%dekkitout> The fuck is that, a fusion rifle?
[3:16:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> I mean it's not similar to a real life shotgun either.
[3:16:02] <%bassoontyphoon> 3
[3:16:05] <nuane> thats a dlc gun alright
[3:16:08] <%justnathan18> Fuck my AC just went out and its like 90 out
[3:16:08] <%kujofire990> we can't see ammo counter tho lol
[3:16:08] <+ezlo_86> if you charge, it consumes more
[3:16:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can't do charge shots with a shotgun in real life either.
[3:16:13] <%ComfortableStranger> GSG+explosive tech armor= GG
[3:16:16] <satans_finest_millennial> i dipped for the last hour, did pat do any other missions?
[3:16:20] <%machshop> moon2WOW
[3:16:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> No 3.
[3:16:23] <AmuserName> @PatStaresAt It's a little weird, but I'm pretty sure you can HOLD onto the shotty charge during your BIOTIC CHARGE.
[3:16:25] <mak0t0yukii> Just trust him
[3:16:28] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> lol
[3:16:28] <HaroldDonchee> fires 3. costs 2
[3:16:29] <nuane> I trust you Patrick
[3:16:32] <$RealThiele> RIP right pat
[3:16:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> Because the last shot you can still do with 1 in teh chamber.

[3:17:43] <akitanito> shepard being a very great distraction
[3:17:44] <%KetsuoTaberu> oh so he didn't really learn his lesson
[3:17:47] <dd44dostivei> It wasn't eeeeasy. I rrreeeaaalllyyy had to work at it.
[3:17:48] <%AncelDeLambert> there it is
[3:17:49] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[3:17:50] <Gorshum> LUL
[3:17:50] <DSD24> Hehehe
[3:17:56] <balthazar758> ayyyyy
[3:17:57] <Blank9> I shot a lot of people without much warning
[3:18:01] <%DashXero> Best line in the game.
[3:18:03] <KaitlynnHere> Kiss him right on the beak
[3:18:06] <Oxybe> he did a badass and got all the mercs butthurt
[3:18:08] <HaroldDonchee> it sounds fucking sick
[3:18:10] <%justnathan18> The best part about this is, if you DONT recruit Garrus in 1, this is kinda just like "hey, youre that dude from C Sec"
[3:18:11] <%ComfortableStranger> good think the mercs stopped firing just long enough for this convo
[3:18:13] <TheApeGatsby> Where did Archangel go? Why is Garrus here?
[3:18:34] <%ainzhelm> lol
[3:18:35] <%Dakuu75> very true
[3:18:39] <%MisterRockett> He has CONCOSSIVE ROUNDS!?
[3:18:41] <%MassConnect> fun fact: after voicing archangel this guy went on to voice Jesus in a different game
[3:18:50] <Pookiedaexzile> "Baby, I just shot you because I love you"
[3:18:51] <%pokefan9956> is archangel sogeking?
[3:18:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> Does that change based on how long you take?
[3:18:53] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat stop simping to Garrus
[3:18:53] <%ComfortableStranger> @TheApeGatsby how can this be?
[3:19:01] <Sartastic> FLIRT WITH HIM
[3:19:04] <+destro_223> Shepard is Garrus' sidekick
[3:19:06] <akitanito> how do concussive rounds even work with thermal clips?
[3:19:10] <DSD24> Garrus is high quality though
[3:19:11] <+Ghufufin> is archangel a secret korean?
[3:19:11] <xhodocto385> massconnect which game?

[3:19:35] <Parapattern> Kill them all, Peter
[3:19:38] <%ComfortableStranger> FYI- concussive shot does extra damage against barriers.
[3:19:38] <%Dakuu75> We gotta save garrus' ass YET AGAIN. for old time sakes
[3:19:41] <%MassConnect> one of the Telltale Walking Dead seasons

[3:20:02] <HaroldDonchee> fucking clankers
[3:20:04] <%DashXero> Wasn't that a renegade move?
[3:20:05] <CheeseBurgerHelper> i super don't get why that's a renegade option

[3:20:26] <%OldOnyx> ask edi
[3:20:28] <%Robot_Nixon_> it was just doing its job FeelsBadMan
[3:20:28] <iosephe> it is dishonorable
[3:20:28] <James_Quivers> Sometimes renegade jsut means badass
[3:20:28] <Profmcstevie> Ask the Geth
[3:20:29] <CatRidder> legions has feelings
[3:20:29] <nuane> only geth are people tho
[3:20:29] <Mattais88> becasue you haven't got sniper proficency?

[3:20:32] <Explodincatz> just like old times eh Gordan?
[3:20:33] <+Bail_Seven> that robot could have been the next legion
[3:20:33] <KaitlynnHere> Because
[3:20:34] <Pookiedaexzile> YEYEYEYEYE

[3:21:00] <dd44dostivei> pieta bot
[3:21:06] <%justnathan18> You can leave the house??
[3:21:09] <+Punchasaur> Yeah you spent the whole first game shootin robits
[3:21:16] <NeroInfinite> KAsumi dead
[3:21:18] <%ComfortableStranger> squad auto-powers on?
[3:21:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah this is the best weapon for vanguards since they rely on the shotgun almost exclusively.
[3:21:32] <DSD24> Weakening their integrity!
[3:21:36] <$RealThiele> kasumi you are just yawn
[3:21:37] <AthenaAegis> You can hold the charge through the, uh....charge. JEEZUS that's ridiculous
[3:21:38] <$SGrim> Asari?
[3:21:41] <%animaturgy> Asorri
[3:21:43] <+Ghufufin> My name is Command Sheperd and Garrus Vakarian is my favorite roof koren in the Citadel
[3:21:43] <%pokefan9956> is garrus an usopp
[3:21:43] <HaroldDonchee> sorry asari
[3:21:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Only room for one Vangaurd
[3:21:44] <mak0t0yukii> Is so busted
[3:21:52] <%spartanghost004> how did they lose right?
[3:21:56] <%MidnightBurst12> goodbye
[3:21:56] <%Dakuu75> Pat like, "Ya'know... these Geth... they ain't so bad."
[3:22:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt You can get a Geth Pulse Rifle too but only if you do Tali's loyalty mission on hardcore or insanity difficulty.
[3:22:05] <+destro_223> is this on normal?
[3:22:07] <%AncelDeLambert> well it IS half Reaper tech
[3:22:10] <zerointelligence000> How did the Geth not reck you if they all had these weapons?
[3:22:16] <%Monkeyweed21> I did this mission as an infiltrator and got to be sniper buddies with Garrus
[3:22:17] <Oxybe> Waist high barrels! Our future tech guns's only weakness.
[3:22:21] <+FelIian> wish you could charge and stay in cover at the same time (no peeking)
[3:22:22] <%Deadpal> Deadpal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! 3 Years and a month? Can't believe it. Also I hope you enjoy mass effect 3 when you get to it. I'm loving your mass eeffect 2 playthrough so far!
[3:22:27] <%ComfortableStranger> you know charging restores your barriers, right?
[3:22:30] <fugly_nick> Kasumi's cool
[3:22:33] <James_Quivers> Kasumi just donkey punches them in the back of the head
[3:22:37] <%AncelDeLambert> ... actually, I've never seen that gun before
[3:22:47] <DSD24> Ringout!
[3:22:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Kasumi's tactical cloak attack is great. One of the best abilities.
[3:22:51] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> God charge is fucking BUSTED
[3:22:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Well the Bloods and Crips haven't joined in yet, give em a shot
[3:22:58] <+senfood> That's...a hell of an achievement.
[3:23:00] <feralspidey> that guy missed with a rocket, when all he has to do is deal splash damage!
[3:23:01] <dd44dostivei> charging behind enemy lines basically  makes the game turn based
[3:23:07] <Profmcstevie> Kasumi getting intimate with the floor
[3:23:08] <+VGrekd> damn I always thought this was a pew pew game, didnt know you had sick moves
[3:23:08] <stormhawk9891> @AncelDeLambert It was a DLC gun in the original
[3:23:11] <AthenaAegis> OOF
[3:23:11] <DSD24> Man Garrus is so pumped right now
[3:23:17] <+D00msDayDan> garrus loves it
[3:23:20] <%YakumoYomi> Over the top rope!
[3:23:32] <+Punchasaur> YEET
[3:23:34] <+Buzzkill983> He's fighting with his best bud again
[3:23:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> Garrus is probably cumming in his armor.
[3:23:38] <jorniev> holy shit infiltrator + vanguard is busted
[3:23:42] <+trackles_64> the geth weapons look so stupid to me imo
[3:23:42] <$RealThiele> his carapace would chitter with anticipation
[3:23:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> You'll want to get off the bridge here.
[3:23:45] <feralspidey> oh boy, instakarma
[3:23:47] <%ComfortableStranger> @Too_Much_Nukie not against armor, shields or barriers
[3:23:47] <NeroInfinite> The one we fucke dup? LUL
[3:23:50] <deviljhojho_> lmao
[3:23:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> Because the mech is gonna go nuts.
[3:23:51] <+Credfield_> Why is kevin spacey on the bottom
[3:23:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @VGrekd it's only a pew pew game if you pick soldier, but why would you do that
[3:23:58] <BlackStarAura> The rigged ass robot
[3:24:00] <mak0t0yukii> Oh nooooo
[3:24:01] <%Robot_Nixon_> GOLIATH ONLINE
[3:24:02] <nuane> LUL
[3:24:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ComfortableStranger It still works on armored enemies.
[3:24:05] <mak0t0yukii> LUL
[3:24:06] <SaltyAzteca> how unfortunate for you
[3:24:09] <Alzero83> Oh no.....
[3:24:09] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @jorniev it's why I always had Garrus when I was a Vanguard lol
[3:24:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Woops
[3:24:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ComfortableStranger You can use it for so many different things.
[3:24:18] <fugly_nick> @VGrekd Even Soldier has some fun stuff in ME2 and 3
[3:24:22] <+MrAtheGreat> Those gremlins not nly got the game they got the robot too!!!!
[3:24:25] <Oxybe> Whoopsiedoodle
[3:24:26] <%ComfortableStranger> @Too_Much_Nukie does negligible damage
[3:24:30] <Pookiedaexzile> She's a literal Sniper Rifle
[3:24:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> See she just used it on the robot when it had armor.
[3:24:31] <+FelIian> who did he leave on Virmire?
[3:24:33] <zerointelligence000> Oh no... anyways
[3:24:33] <+VGrekd> Ive had it in my backlog since forever might as well try it later tonight
[3:24:35] <nuane> did they try turning it off and on again?
[3:24:36] <HookmastahCathy> kasumi really gonna say nothin personal kid
[3:24:39] <feralspidey> this is giving me serious bioshock vibes - turning a big daddy friendly and letting him go to town on splicers
[3:24:43] <+Punchasaur> He got xcommed
[3:24:43] <DSD24> Ashley
[3:24:47] <+VGrekd> thanks guys, very Pog of you
[3:24:50] <Dunmarkh> @FelIian ashley
[3:24:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ComfortableStranger Still gives her a teleport.
[3:24:59] <+FelIian> Thank God
[3:25:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah it's not a shotgun at all.

[3:25:38] <$Faustgesicht> No~
[3:25:38] <Parapattern> Maybe ;)
[3:25:38] <%emperordread> digital deluxe pay to win edition
[3:25:38] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yes
[3:25:39] <%Deadpal> It's not , it's really good t-
[3:25:39] <NeroInfinite> It's a big DLC gun
[3:25:39] <%sunsetdisc0> it is
[3:25:43] <%Deadpal> This was dlc????
[3:25:48] <shotgang86> maybe
[3:25:49] <TourettesPlays> yes the vanilla weapons in ME2 were boring as fuck
[3:25:50] <%Maids4lyfe> no?
[3:25:51] <fugly_nick> All the best weapons are DLC
[3:25:52] <dd44dostivei> THE MATTOCK RIFLE IS BETTER
[3:25:53] <+RowenCleric> I remember that shotgun not being as good on higher difficulties
[3:25:56] <deviljhojho_> or at least it used to be
[3:25:57] <%Papa_Bearman> Shotgun is BIG goods.
[3:25:57] <%MidnightBurst12> it is dlc
[3:25:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> OH YA
[3:25:59] <%Maids4lyfe> oh probably
[3:26:01] <DSD24> It feels so good
[3:26:02] <+Deadpal> oh my god it totallly is dlc.
[3:26:02] <+Dreadknight297> thats very true.
[3:26:03] <%ComfortableStranger> @Too_Much_Nukie its the ai there is no good using it, maybe you're playing on easy mode tho
[3:26:03] <%MidnightBurst12> true
[3:26:04] <+eanscrale> They got that EA money
[3:26:04] <%DashXero> That sounds about right.
[3:26:05] <$RealThiele> BEEG MONEE
[3:26:05] <+XIR0> What about Nier
[3:26:06] <+Bail_Seven> nier?
[3:26:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Such a tight combat flow
[3:26:10] <%Deadpal> @fugly_nick That's not true the nuke exists!
[3:26:11] <James_Quivers> Budget feels like it quintupled
[3:26:11] <+FelIian> what difficulty he on?
[3:26:11] <+eanscrale> the soul stealin money
[3:26:11] <%Eaglestrike117> you grabbed the sniper rifle right? or can you not grab it yet
[3:26:13] <Blank9> wait until 3
[3:26:15] <%Deadpal> nier too.
[3:26:15] <geosspone> okay but witcher 1 to witcher 2 tho
[3:26:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> ME1 is Clunky as fuck ME2 is BUTTERY SMOOTH
[3:26:17] <feralspidey> big game budget increase
[3:26:18] <jorniev> this and uncharted 2
[3:26:18] <+D00msDayDan> crysis to crysis 2 is kind of close
[3:26:22] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Even DMC2 to 3
[3:26:23] <+Ropcord> LUL okay yeah nier
[3:26:23] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Did you do the Asteroid DLC in ME1
[3:26:24] <%G_Thunders> Witcher 2 to Witcher 3 though
[3:26:24] <+Punchasaur> It really makes you feel like you spent money on it
[3:26:24] <zerointelligence000> Going from ME1 to 2 immediately was weird
[3:26:26] <+FelIian> 3 is the best (except the ending)
[3:26:27] <%strakillias> Dmx 2-->3
[3:26:27] <+SundanceShot> dmc 2 > dmc 3
[3:26:28] <Blank9> nier's not fair, it has a different developer
[3:26:30] <DSD24> Then you get ME3 and it gets nuts
[3:26:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ComfortableStranger The AI is programmed to never use it on a target that has their shield/barrier/armor up.
[3:26:32] <HookmastahCathy> skyrim oblivion
[3:26:34] <Profmcstevie> Niers cheating, they had a different team do the gameplay
[3:26:35] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Street Fighter 1 and SF2
[3:26:35] <HookmastahCathy> yikes
[3:26:36] <%ainzhelm> witcher 1 to witcher 2 to witcher 3
[3:26:37] <wasteless40800> mass effect 2 is perfect
[3:26:37] <%MaxeusTheFirst> W/A Risk of Rain?
[3:26:39] <fugly_nick> NieR 1.22 thins the gap a littel
[3:26:40] <James_Quivers> Nah, Witcher 2 is still pretty significant jank
[3:26:42] <DSD24> Combat is the best in ME3
[3:26:43] <%justnathan18> Watch your face, Garrus
[3:26:45] <%AncelDeLambert> to be completely fair, Neir is a LOW BAR in terms of gameplay
[3:26:45] <%bread_assassin> Does Yakuza 6 to LAD count?
[3:26:47] <Sol_Install> DMC, uncharted, there's a few
[3:26:49] <+Punchasaur> Zelda to Zelda 2 lol
[3:26:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ComfortableStranger I was playing ME2 on insanity for hours, with Kasumi, before this stream today.
[3:26:50] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> first new emote psaDab
[3:26:50] <jorniev> holy shit dmc2 to dmc3 is the most unfair
[3:26:54] <%AzureGale> Burnout 2 to Burnout 3
[3:26:54] <+RADDicalDood> oh my god garrus looks so high quality
[3:26:56] <Basch71> its the best filler game ever
[3:26:56] <+VGrekd> @PatStaresAt did you already give an opinion on Elden Ring?
[3:26:57] <+poysendemon> eww what happened to Pat Shepard face?
[3:26:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> Trust me on this.
[3:26:59] <HookmastahCathy> yea this is a big catagory
[3:27:00] <+TristonObv> Its comprable to KH to K2
[3:27:00] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Witcher 2 is a fucking godly uptier
[3:27:00] <%ComfortableStranger> @Too_Much_Nukie which is most targets if you are playing on hard
[3:27:01] <%Maids4lyfe> if I get the trilogy, can I still skip 1 and keep the people I want alive in  2? @PatStaresAt
[3:27:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> The fact that Witcher 2 is a contender and its still so jank just speaks to how jank the first one was
[3:27:02] <mak0t0yukii> He's super tired
[3:27:02] <$Memdosu> ME3 combat is best imho
[3:27:03] <%LumberjackJack> Uh oh
[3:27:03] <mybigmeech> system shock 1 to system shock 2 is the biggest jump imo
[3:27:07] <peachy996> Garrus so pretty
[3:27:08] <fugly_nick> RE CVX to RE4
[3:27:08] <CrypticMochi> The other best shotgun was a krogan shotgun, right?
[3:27:10] <Archmortal> Witcher 1 to 2 is different, but 2 doesn't exactly have GREAT gameplay like ME2 and Automata
[3:27:10] <Pookiedaexzile> JEt Grind Radio to Jet Set Radio Future
[3:27:12] <dd44dostivei> @Punchasaur aaaay i like you
[3:27:13] <%AzureGale> Ratchet & Clank to Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando
[3:27:14] <Oxybe> Garrus 4K sexy
[3:27:14] <%ainzhelm> someone make garrus a sandwich
[3:27:17] <James_Quivers> PacMan to Mrs PacMan tho
[3:27:17] <feralspidey> Halo 2, KH2, DMC3 (cause 2 doesn't exist) Uncharted 2... HALF-LIFE 2!! Just skip straight into the second installment, and call it a day right there!
[3:27:17] <$RealThiele> bag?
[3:27:22] <DSD24> Krogan Shotgun is really good
[3:27:25] <jorniev> BUST OUT THE BIG GUN
[3:27:34] <Sol_Install> i thought you were talking to gief for a sec
[3:27:36] <%machshop> he probably has a cloaca
[3:27:39] <feralspidey> i need your D that can kill humans safe
[3:27:40] <peachy996> Give him Zaeed
[3:27:41] <%spartanghost004> nope
[3:27:42] <+Krecart> does garrus even have a dick?
[3:27:43] <+FelIian> Man ME2 male cheekbones suck
[3:27:43] <fugly_nick> I don't remember this choice
[3:27:45] <dd44dostivei> GARRUS AND ZAEED SEEM LLIKE GOOD FRIENDS
[3:27:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ComfortableStranger You use it to finish enemies off, that's why it has the ability to get a super short cooldown when you kill someone with it.
[3:27:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Space Dick got Shepat running around snitch
[3:27:45] <%Papa_Bearman> Not really.
[3:27:46] <%ainzhelm> gives you more time
[3:27:46] <%justnathan18> ZAEED
[3:27:46] <$SGrim> It changes who's in your party
[3:27:46] <DatAsuna> just your time limit
[3:27:47] <mak0t0yukii> Zaeed
[3:27:49] <$Memdosu> meh
[3:27:49] <Alzero83> yes
[3:27:50] <NeroInfinite> Nope
[3:27:50] <+Punchasaur> @dd44dostivei bleedPurple
[3:27:52] <+Buzzkill983> It slows down the damage he takes and gives you more time
[3:27:53] <jorniev> yes
[3:27:54] <peachy996> Nah but let him have Zaeed, he's not doing much
[3:27:55] <DSD24> Zaeed should stay
[3:27:56] <BinaryShuffle> No, just god boy points
[3:27:56] <+MrAtheGreat> Garrus will die if you don't leave someone behind :D
[3:27:56] <%LumberjackJack> Gives you more time
[3:27:56] <+disgruntledgruntle> @machshop it's 100% a cloaca
[3:27:57] <ketchuo13> He takes more damage
[3:27:57] <buhbuhboat> gives you more time before garrus dies
[3:27:57] <%bread_assassin> He probably loses health slower.
[3:27:58] <%Monkeyweed21> gives you more time
[3:27:59] <Oxybe> @machshop a sexy cloaca
[3:28:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ComfortableStranger It seems like you just don't control the AI at all bro.
[3:28:02] <%spartanghost004> gives you extra time that is about it
[3:28:03] <DatAsuna> if you take both, you gotta get back faster
[3:28:06] <$Faustgesicht> Zaeed
[3:28:06] <%Maids4lyfe> take Kasumi with you
[3:28:08] <fugly_nick> Zaeed's probably good at holding the line
[3:28:09] <$Futurecity10> Give him zaeed
[3:28:10] <jorniev> ZAEED
[3:28:10] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> more time for garrus to stay alive
[3:28:11] <+Krecart> He takes less damage if you leave someone with him.
[3:28:11] <$RealThiele> pat needs big time
[3:28:12] <peachy996> Give him Zazzers
[3:28:13] <tattleworm> do it, it's fine
[3:28:16] <+gespenst25> gibe him a reinforcment
[3:28:17] <%spartanghost004> some snappy dialouge
[3:28:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> Leave one with him for sure.
[3:28:17] <%ComfortableStranger> @Too_Much_Nukie use headshots and you won't need to finish anyone
[3:28:19] <%Shubreaker> takes less damage
[3:28:19] <%AncelDeLambert> Now that we know Garrus is voiced by Senator Armstrong, has anyone tried to take Armstrong's speech at the end of Revengeance and modulate it to sound like Garrus?
[3:28:22] <%machshop> @Oxybe of course of course
[3:28:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Zaheed can fight
[3:28:25] <%justnathan18> Good choice.
[3:28:27] <%bassoontyphoon> Get him zuzu
[3:28:30] <Basch71> kasumi can help you clear more often than zaeed could
[3:28:33] <+poysendemon> Zaeed is so cool
[3:28:34] <%LumberjackJack> Zaeed and Garrus gonna have a sniping contest. They'll have fun
[3:28:34] <James_Quivers> Zaeed isn't known for defending friends, tho lol
[3:28:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ComfortableStranger Headshots don't kill in one shot on higher difficulties. Even for infiltrators.
[3:28:39] <+destro_223> Zaeed does more damage, take him
[3:28:40] <+Punchasaur> Resident evil 3 to 4 and Re 6 to 7
[3:28:45] <FassieFons> QUICKLY, NO LOOTING
[3:28:48] <DSD24> Wait what Garrus is Armstrong?
[3:28:50] <mak0t0yukii> Always paragon
[3:28:53] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> @AncelDeLambert wait fuckin what
[3:28:54] <dd44dostivei> *garrus shoots zaeed immediately*
[3:29:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ComfortableStranger What I like to do is headshot to remove armor/shields then send kasumi over to kill them in one shot.
[3:29:05] <%ComfortableStranger> @Too_Much_Nukie you're not using the correct weapons then
[3:29:07] <%spartanghost004> that gun is glorius
[3:29:10] <peachy996> Give him the Mattock
[3:29:11] <jorniev> MATTOCK IS SO GOOD
[3:29:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> As an infiltrator.
[3:29:13] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> "How do I get to the basement" "go down to the first floor, then go to the basement"
[3:29:14] <James_Quivers> @PatStaresAt This works because Zaeed and Garrus have a hilarious bro-arc in the Citadel DLC
[3:29:16] <+vaultzombie> The Mattock Kreygasm
[3:29:20] <NeroInfinite> THE BLACKHOLE GUN
[3:29:20] <+FelIian> Mattock BEST RIFLE
[3:29:22] <TourettesPlays> Mattock is endgame tier weapon
[3:29:28] <%Shubreaker> Mattock is the best gun in the game
[3:29:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ComfortableStranger What sniper rifle should I be using then if you're so dead set on pretending you know what you're talking about?
[3:29:35] <jorniev> BIG GUN
[3:29:42] <%spartanghost004> you also missed the best pistol in the by not getting mordin
[3:29:43] <%ComfortableStranger> @TourettesPlays wish it was in me3 too
[3:29:46] <+FelIian> Geth Plasma Shotgun has a fixed pattern I believe @PatStaresAt so not affected by spread, hence accurate as balls
[3:29:51] <jorniev> BUST OUT THE BIG GUN
[3:29:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> Sure seems like Mantis and Widow would have the best headshot damage but maybe I've not actually beaten the game 10 times.
[3:29:56] <%ComfortableStranger> widow
[3:29:56] <%ainzhelm> @PatStaresAt black hole gun?
[3:30:01] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> Pat remember your damn charge
[3:30:08] <BlackStarAura> I hate this area so much
[3:30:09] <peachy996> The Mattock is in ME3 but it's nowhere near as cool as it is in this
[3:30:09] <HaroldDonchee> kill those vorcha
[3:30:12] <SaltyAzteca> LUL Kasumi
[3:30:15] <$RealThiele> LUL
[3:30:17] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> yee
[3:30:18] <BlackStarAura> That one flamethrower bastard
[3:30:20] <Chaos_Aether> Let's Party
[3:30:21] <+FelIian> @ComfortableStranger you can alter the files on PC to make it so
[3:30:25] <fugly_nick> The power wheel works really well as a sort of bullet time
[3:30:26] <%Maids4lyfe> he regenerated
[3:30:29] <xhodocto385> Nelson Muntz laugh kasumi LUL
[3:30:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> The Mattock is in ME3 and so is the Harrier which is an automatic version of the Mattock.
[3:30:38] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> psaDab
[3:30:41] <DSD24> Oh man flamers on Insanity are the worst
[3:30:42] <%ComfortableStranger> @FelIian yeah, theres a word for that..
[3:30:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> Modding.
[3:31:00] <%G_Thunders> Charge never gets old, it’s such a great mechanic
[3:31:03] <dd44dostivei> @fugly_nick yeah it 's basically VATS
[3:31:04] <barmydodger> forgot how fun vanguards could be
[3:31:10] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> @Too_Much_Nukie The Harrier MELTS people
[3:31:10] <+Ropcord> automattock best gun
[3:31:12] <%ComfortableStranger> Harrier is OP as fuk
[3:31:21] <TourettesPlays> Hitting Pyros with overload and blowing them up is Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:31:22] <jorniev> this is kinda ackward
[3:31:25] <DatAsuna> ME3 adding the slide over cover was minor but appreciated
[3:31:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> yeah the harrier is designed to be broken. It was DLC.
[3:31:36] <$SGrim> @DSD24 Soldier adrenaline rush lets you tank flamers no big deal.

[3:32:04] <%logoth_> Look at how cool Vanguard is.
[3:32:05] <%ComfortableStranger> @jorniev blackstar

[3:32:12] <xhodocto385> shooting space shark dogs? BibleThump
[3:32:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> @buhbuhboat Garrus with anything in ME3.
[3:32:14] <James_Quivers> Zaeeds voice was missing the radio static lol
[3:32:19] <%heartlesshealer> charge is so good in 2 and 3
[3:32:25] <+FelIian> @buhbuhboat yea he's nuts, even on insane he melts
[3:32:25] <peachy996> Oh hell give everyone the Typhoon in 3, everything in London melts even on Insanity
[3:32:29] <TourettesPlays> "Time to get those damn shutters open" but you're closing them??
[3:32:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> Charge doesn't exist in 1.
[3:32:34] <FassieFons> NO, BAD VORCHA
[3:32:40] <HaroldDonchee> is it this game that has the thing about somebody getting a varren disease
[3:32:41] <DSD24> Bodied
[3:32:42] <akitanito> would be hilarious if the dog can interrupt the shutters
[3:32:49] <jorniev> TIME FOR BLACKSTAR

[3:33:06] <+FelIian> @HaroldDonchee throw away line from Mordin yea XD
[3:33:07] <%heartlesshealer> @Too_Much_Nukie I didn't use biotics in 1 and didn't want to assume it wasn't there
[3:33:09] <%ComfortableStranger> @peachy996 typhoon has bonus to armor, barrier and shield damage, so yeah it would do that
[3:33:10] <SaltyAzteca> YEYEYEYEYE SINGULARITY
[3:33:10] <%pokefan9956> [sogeking theme intensifies]
[3:33:10] <$SGrim> @DSD24 It makes most missions pretty fun. The heavier collector constructs are still a bastard and a half, but the rest of the game can be done as a more challenging stand-up fight.
[3:33:12] <Chaos_Aether> Remind me is the Omniblade in 2 or 3?
[3:33:14] <NeroInfinite> Yep that'll sovle the problem LUL
[3:33:16] <$RealThiele> SUCC

[3:33:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Chaos_Aether 3
[3:33:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> Melee in this game is so powerful even before you upgrade it.
[3:33:36] <%Papa_Bearman> Biotics and tech powers were WAY less impactful in 1 compared to 2.
[3:33:40] <+Krecart> just go up the stairs lol
[3:33:41] <Basch71> deleted his ass
[3:33:45] <+Punchasaur> The vorcha just make LOTR orc noises lmao

[3:37:05] <cellaccount> lol sup
[3:37:11] <SauceJockey> pro tip for any vanguard: bind charge to mouse wheel up so you can just scroll your mousewheel and charge the nearest enemy the instant you leave cooldown
[3:37:27] <SauceJockey> never stop charging, you will be too powerful

[3:41:26] <%Varlinator> Just like ooooooold times
[3:41:27] <+FelIian> ME 1 Garrus is kinda dull compared to ME2
[3:41:28] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> @Mr_Britannia Everyone has like two alt appearances
[3:41:28] <%Nekros4442> Garrus...you wana replace that armor dude?
[3:41:28] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Yeah GARRUS

[3:41:39] <buhbuhboat> calibrations Kreygasm
[3:41:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> Garrus' DLC armor in this is pretty cool yeah.
[3:41:40] <+Rhamboned> I'd still fuck garrus the face aint that bad
[3:41:41] <%CalderGaming> LET THE CALIBRATIONS COMMENCE
[3:41:41] <FassieFons> just a baby portion of murder
[3:41:41] <nuane> murder is okay when shepard does it
[3:41:42] <BlackStarAura> Worth it
[3:41:42] <%Nekros4442> Isnt the Mattock really good?
[3:41:43] <%Varlinator> He will now calibrate for the next 7000 hours
[3:41:43] <%Treuan> Occasionally have a bit of murder, as a treat
[3:41:44] <peachy996> Garrus has DLC armor that's not busted looking
[3:41:44] <%Papa_Bearman> Pat, was that your Bill Cosby impression?
[3:41:45] <%DashXero> Justifiable murder. it's no big deal.
[3:41:46] <ItIsSky> we do a little murder
[3:41:46] <CanonFang_> do mercenaries have rights?
[3:41:46] <+senfood> He basically murdered everyone he had a prolonged conversation with.
[3:41:46] <ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> MATTOCK
[3:41:48] <muXPerience> a batman arc softens up any cop
[3:41:49] <+yoshkosh20> Pfff, Details.
[3:41:49] <%Monkeyweed21> you stabbed a guy with an electric knife
[3:41:50] <LockingKey> Bros before foes
[3:41:52] <%spartanghost004> the best rifle in the game
[3:41:52] <%Nekros4442> I remember the Mattock being the best
[3:41:53] <Jane_Lo> wait, there's no line with him about finishing if you're not femshep?
[3:41:53] <James_Quivers> Mattock is better cuz DLC
[3:41:53] <+FelIian> OOPS ALL CALIBRATIONS
[3:41:54] <%ainzhelm> Garrus, I dont give a shit about your aweful missile face wound. We have to go through the plague apartments
[3:41:55] <DSD24> Its amazing
[3:41:55] <+destro_223> calibrations
[3:41:55] <%Ranryu692> it's very good
[3:41:56] <tattleworm> always mattock
[3:41:56] <alroy900> they were mostly batarians, so its ok, they needed to be purified
[3:41:57] <NeroInfinite> It is very good
[3:41:57] <+ryuguitarfreak> Garrus became the best in 2
[3:41:57] <peachy996> It's super good
[3:41:58] <%KetsuoTaberu> best gun
[3:41:58] <thetunnelhomer> Mattock is busted good
[3:41:59] <+pmtriox> semi auto so its okay
[3:41:59] <deviljhojho_> its golden
[3:41:59] <dd44dostivei> it's busted OP
[3:41:59] <$Futurecity10> Its the best AR in the game
[3:42:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> The Mattock is very good.
[3:42:01] <$SGrim> It's the best standard AR in the game
[3:42:02] <%Varlinator> BEST
[3:42:03] <%LumberjackJack> Mattock is proven to make your dick bigger
[3:42:05] <%Shubreaker> the best gun in the game
[3:42:05] <+Ropcord> mattock best boy
[3:42:07] <+Buzzkill983> I think Mattock has the highest damage per shot?
[3:42:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> Mattock is a powerful semi-auto AR.
[3:42:08] <dd44dostivei> MATLOCK IS DISGUSTING
[3:42:10] <ioci2112> it's a dlc weapon, of course it's the best
[3:42:11] <peachy996> Mattock punches
[3:42:11] <ivanmistwalker> REALLY GOOD
[3:42:13] <%ComfortableStranger> kelly got HOTTER
[3:42:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> I mean, Revenant has higher DPS.
[3:42:15] <DSD24> Kelly is nice
[3:42:19] <fugly_nick> Kelly got less hot in LE
[3:42:20] <stantheman_97> omega is a shithole so someone needs to be a punisher
[3:42:20] <+Punchasaur> Put some neosporin on it
[3:42:20] <%bassoontyphoon> I like me2 cast because pretty much none of your squad are “good people”
[3:42:22] <%justnathan18> Fun fact. you can go through ME1 without recruiting Garrus, so hes like twice as badass in 2 because hes just a random C Sec dude that went rogue.
[3:42:23] <%spartanghost004> oh hey the side missions
[3:42:23] <+D00msDayDan> mattock is good but carries like no ammo
[3:42:29] <HaroldDonchee> ambidextrous grip is cool as hell
[3:42:33] <TourettesPlays> Pat are you going to infiltrate Kelly Chamber's smelly chamber?????
[3:42:41] <+FelIian> Liara and Garrus get SO much better in the later games, ME2/3 Garrus is amazing and ME3 Liara is ride or die
[3:42:43] <$RealThiele> LUL shitty gun guy
[3:42:43] <akitanito> he didn't give you 50 creds
[3:42:45] <%ComfortableStranger> bang kelly, no negative repercussions
[3:42:48] <+XIR0> I only just thought that since Garrus is supposed to kinda have a parallel arch to Shephard, when Shephard gets facial scars, they couldn't help but give them to Garrus too
[3:42:49] <DSD24> Merc Gang's bodied by Super Cop
[3:42:52] <%ainzhelm> @Too_Much_Nukie You cant just buy the revenant tho
[3:42:53] <%spartanghost004> garrus will never die
[3:42:54] <%Varlinator> NO! His name was Guy! I refuse to believe anything else!

[3:44:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt There's a mod in production right now for that tho
[3:44:36] <+MrAtheGreat> They should have added the option imo
[3:44:37] <$RealThiele> wrap it before you tap it

[3:45:05] <+destro_223> calibrating the calibrations
[3:45:07] <%bassoontyphoon> @patstaresat one of the most frustrating things about the romances is that there are no gay alien relationships
[3:45:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah it's SOMEBODY but fans just decided it was Kelly because she's a slut.
[3:45:10] <Jane_Lo> @heartlesshealer only with mods still
[3:45:12] <%spartanghost004> there any space racists on the ship?
[3:45:13] <%heartlesshealer> bluh

[3:45:29] <%justnathan18> Change your murder clothes Garrus
[3:45:33] <%ComfortableStranger> @bassoontyphoon Liara has a gay option
[3:45:34] <%DashXero> Garrus, you're not human, bro.
[3:45:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> @bassoontyphoon The only romance you can do in all 3 games?
[3:45:40] <xhodocto385> no batarians in sight spartanghost
[3:45:44] <%heartlesshealer> @Jane_Lo that sucks. At least modding work didn't go to waste, but damn

[3:46:27] <%ainzhelm> batman
[3:46:28] <Pookiedaexzile> They were a gang
[3:46:29] <DSD24> I really like Garrus's Loyalty Mission
[3:46:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah that's true.
[3:46:34] <%LumberjackJack> Garrus became Punisher, got it
[3:46:38] <Pookiedaexzile> but a gang for good
[3:46:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> But Liara can also be romanced as a girl.
[3:46:46] <dd44dostivei> get under their skiiiiiiiin
[3:46:50] <%spartanghost004> Guerilla warfare baby
[3:46:51] <Jane_Lo> @heartlesshealer yeah, to that point that you literally can restore kaidan maleshep romance from me1 with proper import to me2 and then no issues with me3
[3:46:53] <CosmicApe13> Garrus what a G
[3:46:58] <%ComfortableStranger> Paige Keeps saying she wants to bone Garrus but refuses to play the game anymore
[3:46:59] <%justnathan18> Asari have no gender.
[3:47:00] <%Varlinator> ooooh yeah talk dirty to me Garrus
[3:47:06] <xhodocto385> are ALL turians just mercenaries?, even turian kids? WutFace
[3:47:14] <Jane_Lo> @heartlesshealer and these files are still in the game, bioware just didn't bother unlocking them
[3:47:15] <xhodocto385> Asari are genderless?, no surprise here
[3:47:19] <akitanito> paige just wants the garrus SFMs
[3:47:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> Asari have gender, they're monogender.
[3:47:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> Not the same thing as no gender.
[3:47:25] <TrollKing96> Make a street gang to fuck with the mob.
[3:47:25] <%ComfortableStranger> @justnathan18 monogendered, according to the codex
[3:47:26] <muXPerience> @Pookiedaexzile I'm Playing Boring Spectre
[3:47:30] <buhbuhboat> all Turians have mandatory military service
[3:47:32] <arkv01> whats up with shep's pose
[3:47:33] <iosephe> Strange, isn't it?
[3:47:36] <+FelIian> @justnathan18 They refer to themselves as She/Her
[3:47:39] <HookmastahCathy> he might have been suicidal
[3:47:39] <+trackles_64> Garrus hate beuracrucy
[3:47:43] <akitanito> they want desk job cops
[3:47:46] <deviljhojho_> more like c-sucks lmao
[3:47:48] <deviljhojho_> gottem
[3:47:51] <nuane> he just wanted to kill people and thats okay
[3:47:51] <%justnathan18> Isnt monogender the same as no gender? like thered be no point of the concept.
[3:47:53] <KeystoneA2> And robots
[3:47:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> All Asari are women. They're not genderless.
[3:47:54] <+JaseAdrift> Garrus really wanted to become the punisher
[3:47:55] <%spartanghost004> I think he did and then just got bored
[3:47:56] <Gorshum> They wanted anyone except Garrus back.
[3:48:00] <%Varlinator> You know he loves it
[3:48:01] <+yoshkosh20> Garrus couldn't calm his murder boner on the citidel.
[3:48:03] <+RaveBV> @arkv01 He's roleplaying Pat, emulating the postures.
[3:48:05] <arkv01> I mean its be batman, or join the NYPD
[3:48:07] <%MassConnect> So garrus is just C sick?
[3:48:07] <Pookiedaexzile> @muXPerience Vaum will get Mass Effect 5 or we will riot
[3:48:11] <CosmicApe13> I believe Garrus took matters into his own hands
[3:48:11] <+pmtriox> c sec priorities were to rebuild not police
[3:48:11] <%sunsetdisc0> garrus talks about omega like an old white racist dude talks about black neighborhoods
[3:48:19] <+Buzzkill983> He was too used to Diplomatic Immunity
[3:48:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> @justnathan18 No gender means you don't identify as male or female. Asari identify as female.
[3:48:20] <+trackles_64> @Too_Much_Nukie  no they are gender neutral
[3:48:23] <James_Quivers> Garrus tried to be Shepard and he FUCKED IT UP
[3:48:23] <%miguelrod777> he got hooked on murder
[3:48:24] <%LumberjackJack> 12 total, huh?
[3:48:26] <+Cacti_Israphe> @justnathan18 they literally are a matriarchal society. just because there are no "males" doesn't mean there's no gender or concept of it
[3:48:26] <%ComfortableStranger> Asari can be father's too
[3:48:28] <xhodocto385> but Omega is full of dangers
[3:48:29] <buhbuhboat> In me3 chobot talks about how turians send the creepiest fan mail
[3:48:30] <%ainzhelm> @yoshkosh20 Its not a murder boner. Its a justice boner, but its a murderous justice boner
[3:48:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> They're explicitly not gender neutral.
[3:48:39] <deviljhojho_> calm down ashley
[3:48:39] <%justnathan18> But Asari can breed with Asari
[3:48:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> They use feminine pronouns and matriarchs.
[3:48:41] <DSD24> Man I miss my Salarian classes in the ME3 multiplayer
[3:48:42] <+TheyTookMyBeard> dirty 4 eyed freaks
[3:48:44] <%spartanghost004> he did say not friendly
[3:48:45] <%LumberjackJack> D: RACISM, TIRED SHEPARD
[3:48:48] <%machshop> pat don't be a space racist
[3:48:48] <%Varlinator> Not the friendliest guy he says LUL
[3:48:49] <xhodocto385> do the Asari still have concept of the Male gender?
[3:48:53] <alroy900> all batarians must be cleansed
[3:48:55] <%ainzhelm> @Cacti_Israphe incorrect
[3:48:55] <Broken_Sonex> @trackles_64 They're chicks. Now drop it

[3:49:22] <$SGrim> @xhodocto385 The rest of the galaxy introduced it to them.
[3:49:23] <KeystoneA2> Give me the quick rundown Mr Bog--Garrus
[3:49:33] <%ainzhelm> Liara literally says in one of her first normandy talks that the asari dont think of gender like the rest of species
[3:49:34] <+Cacti_Israphe> @ainzhelm ok, be wrong. the games are explicit about it
[3:49:40] <+trackles_64> @Broken_Sonex  not how babies and asari physiology works
[3:49:42] <+FelIian> @xhodocto385 no, they use the DNA of another Asari or race to randomise their own via melding to create a child
[3:49:42] <%ComfortableStranger> @TrollKing96 they kidnap humans and make them slaves,
[3:49:45] <deviljhojho_> batarian extimction event when
[3:49:51] <+yoshkosh20> plenty of justice, not enough murder. a conflicting half-chub.
[3:49:52] <Jane_Lo> @xhodocto385 judging by me3 - they totally do

[3:52:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ainzhelm Asari have feminine pronouns, refer to themselves as women, have female reproductive organs, say they have a gender. But I guess that's the same as being non-gendered.

[3:55:02] <James_Quivers> Pat is only mean to the one black crewmember? I see how it is, SMH
[3:55:08] <%Wallabri> atleast MShep doesn't lean sexily on the table when you talk to Jacob
[3:55:08] <DatAsuna> jacob killed a bunch of batarians in an iOS game @PatStaresAt
[3:55:11] <%justnathan18> @muXPerience A hilarious moment where Jacob calls Garrus a slur

[3:55:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ainzhelm They weren't the only living creatures on Thessia.
[3:55:28] <DSD24> @Wallabri I mean he's kinda doing it now
[3:55:29] <ape_hawk> jacob, that reasoning makes no sense
[3:55:30] <peachy996> The bad people like the guy in Overlord
[3:55:36] <KeystoneA2> @logoth_  I hear the camera is focused on her tits now during that scene. Stellar change IMO
[3:55:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's brought up multiple times.
[3:55:39] <DSD24> God these Batarians
[3:55:42] <satans_finest_millennial> @James_Quivers jack isnt here yet, and jacob is big jerk to fem shep
[3:55:44] <%ainzhelm> @Too_Much_Nukie It is stated no where that they used specific pronouns before meeting other species. No where. They can talk about it retroactively. Thats not a contradiction
[3:55:44] <DatAsuna> it was a lame ass twin stick one too
[3:55:45] <alroy900> AGAIN batarians
[3:55:45] <muXPerience> @justnathan18 wait not that part, the part where he feels cucked by an alien
[3:55:46] <peachy996> And Captain Kahoku, real bad person that guy
[3:55:49] <+pmtriox> probably because it was an IOS game
[3:55:56] <mak0t0yukii> An IOS game that doesn't exist anymore
[3:55:58] <FassieFons> jacob and vega should've been merged into the same person
[3:56:05] <xhodocto385> Chat did Thessia had other creatures that weren't monogendered? Kappa
[3:56:11] <peachy996> You can't bully Jacob Pat
[3:56:11] <CSeriesJTYPE> does jacob have more ass shots than miranda now
[3:56:12] <TourettesPlays> Wait so is the iOS game content just naturally integrated into the dialogue now?
[3:56:15] <DSD24> Vega is cooler than Jacob
[3:56:15] <Profmcstevie> Why can't I insult him Bioware
[3:56:19] <xhodocto385> a planet has many creatures, not just sapients like humans
[3:56:29] <+pmtriox> Pat did you fuck Jacob on your first go? is that why?
[3:56:29] <+trackles_64> like a clone?

[3:57:29] <+GingerStrawhat> Like that's why I don't care for him
[3:57:31] <peachy996> @bassoontyphoon yeah
[3:57:32] <%42nfl19> How does he comapre to Kaiden @PatStaresAt
[3:57:32] <DSD24> He's guy

[3:57:33] <%spartanghost004> many people do interestingly enough

[3:57:34] <Blank9> he's kaiden without the biotics backstory baggage
[3:57:35] <%emperordread> Spiderman pointing at Spiderman dot jpeg
[3:57:36] <peachy996> Pretty much
[3:57:36] <%OldOnyx> more than Kaiden?
[3:57:36] <+Kyma1020> oh he's just a dude
[3:57:36] <+lucaflowe> He's black Kaiden
[3:57:37] <%Grimlockfly> I don't even remember Jacob until seeing him just now
[3:57:37] <mak0t0yukii> He's just a dude
[3:57:38] <FassieFons> he is the most human human that ever humaned
[3:57:39] <%Garthunox> he's bland
[3:57:41] <+GingerStrawhat> It's the same thing with Kaiden
[3:57:42] <%heartlesshealer> human = boring
[3:57:42] <DSD24> Ashley does
[3:57:44] <stantheman_97> he's a soldier man
[3:57:45] <ape_hawk> kaiden had more going on
[3:57:47] <%Varlinator> He has daddy issues
[3:57:47] <zerointelligence000> at least Ashley was racist
[3:57:48] <fugly_nick> Kaiden has way more going on
[3:57:49] <BlueLunecy> The greatest sin a character can commit in a story is be boring
[3:57:49] <peachy996> Even after his loyalty mission
[3:57:50] <+trackles_64> shame she was a space racist tho
[3:57:51] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt KAIDAN HAS MORE GOING ON
[3:57:51] <Broken_Sonex> BLACK KAIDEN OMG
[3:57:51] <%DianaTheAscian> his character is that he has a penis
[3:57:52] <+SilverDevilfish> Male + Human + Mass effect = Boring
[3:57:54] <%justnathan18> Kaiden at least has powers and repressed anger issues
[3:57:54] <NeroInfinite> he's milktoast
[3:57:54] <xhodocto385> ashley DansGame
[3:57:55] <BlackStarAura> It was fucked up writing for him. Stereotypical as fuck
[3:57:56] <%spartanghost004> yeah, her space racist super powers were a thing
[3:57:56] <%ComfortableStranger> Ash like literature
[3:57:57] <dd44dostivei> jacob only exists as sex object. and is black fetishism on top of that.
[3:57:57] <+GingerStrawhat> Like Kaiden and Jacob belong to the same group
[3:57:58] <+Shockrates20XX> Racist is a personality
[3:57:59] <buhbuhboat> Kaiden is more interesting
[3:58:00] <BurdRightsActivist> Ashley was AT LEAST RACIST
[3:58:00] <DatAsuna> that and daddy issues
[3:58:01] <James_Quivers> And his dad is the Lord Of Flies
[3:58:01] <mak0t0yukii> Can we bang now
[3:58:01] <SovPho> yeah kaiden was way better he had migrains
[3:58:03] <peachy996> Miranda has a character arc, Jacob is stagnant
[3:58:03] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt Ashley's whole narrative thread was explosive.
[3:58:04] <SovPho> migraines
[3:58:06] <akitanito> you don't really hate jacob, you're just apathetic
[3:58:07] <Seth_Tek> He is an Ex Spaec Pirate and he's some how he's boring
[3:58:08] <%heartlesshealer> all the humans are boring aside from ashley and she's a raging racist in 1
[3:58:08] <%Maids4lyfe> Jacob is worse than white bread
[3:58:09] <FassieFons> oh hello butt lady
[3:58:10] <xhodocto385> but no one likes ashley except the alien haters
[3:58:11] <%QueequegTheater> @SilverDevilfish the absolute slander against James Vega
[3:58:11] <DatAsuna> You see he's black so bioware had to give him an absent father
[3:58:12] <+GingerStrawhat> At least James is kind of fun
[3:58:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> Everything interesting about Jacob is related to his dad being crazy.
[3:58:19] <CSeriesJTYPE> talking to jacob as femshep is unbelievably sexually charged
[3:58:23] <%weissguard> Jacob does kinda seem like he's just there to make Miranda look more interesting.
[3:58:24] <+trackles_64> What a simp she is
[3:58:26] <xhodocto385> BOOBA time?
[3:58:26] <stormhawk9891> FUCK YOU
[3:58:29] <DatAsuna> And then they also had to make the only black man the cheater
[3:58:29] <DSD24> He says with all the Cerberus Logo all over the ship
[3:58:30] <%spartanghost004> you killed my squad
[3:58:34] <%heartlesshealer> greetings to A-pose ass
[3:58:34] <+GingerStrawhat> Like James is alright, especially when compared to Jacob or Kaiden
[3:58:36] <Broken_Sonex> Hello, Chick from Dexter/Chuck
[3:58:37] <DatAsuna> GG bioware
[3:58:39] <SovPho> i thought she was english and now that i have experienced more of the world she is clearly ??? australian ???
[3:58:40] <BurdRightsActivist> NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.
[3:58:41] <ape_hawk> "they gave me ROCKIN TITS"
[3:58:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah it's annoying how the voice direction for femshep forces you to hit on Jacob in every conversation.
[3:58:45] <akitanito> like all children
[3:58:47] <%justnathan18> Theres so many negative stereotypes about black people that could be applied to Jacob and his backstory/actions. ITs fucked.
[3:58:47] <Sp3ctre48> Jacob has a very terrible loyalty mission to laugh at, I'll give him that much
[3:58:49] <James_Quivers> So did everyones father ya dumb bitch
[3:58:52] <peachy996> GENETIC FREAK
[3:58:53] <%Torus1025> Vega rules

[3:59:01] <CosmicApe13> Miranda's Dad Genetically Altered her to have the PERFECT ASS
[3:59:02] <+GingerStrawhat> James is just a cartoon character though, looks like someone set all the body sliders on him to max

[3:59:09] <+FelIian> Freaks, freaks everywhere
[3:59:12] <%42nfl19> so a test tube baby like Paige?
[3:59:13] <%heartlesshealer> camera shaking as it zooms in
[3:59:15] <Broken_Sonex> Miranda like: OHHH I'M THE GENETIC FREAK
[3:59:19] <FassieFons> butt dynasty
[3:59:19] <%bassoontyphoon> DADDY ISSUES START
[3:59:19] <%ComfortableStranger> she's from space Australia
[3:59:22] <+BIumen> uh
[3:59:23] <Zalapski> Yvonne <3
[3:59:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Hey fellas is it gay to invest money into giving a female clone of you a Phat Gmo ass
[3:59:25] <%machshop> "give this kid the best ass in the galaxy"
[3:59:29] <%justnathan18> @GingerStrawhat James is just a cast member of the Jersey SHore
[3:59:29] <peachy996> James Vega still has more of a personality than Jacob ever has
[3:59:33] <%pokefan9956> EUGENICS
[3:59:33] <$SGrim> GREATER GOOD
[3:59:43] <%DashXero> Miranda found a new daddy in the Elusive Man.
[3:59:45] <TheIronBrass> THE GREATER GOOD
[3:59:45] <%Garthunox> if she's perfect why's she aussie?
[3:59:46] <xhodocto385> they genetically gave her the best rump Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:59:46] <CosmicApe13> The Greater Good.. Hot Fuzz
[3:59:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> Remember how Miranda's dad was IN Cerberus?
[3:59:48] <%machshop> fuckin businessmaaaaaan
[3:59:49] <Seth_Tek> MURDOC!
[3:59:49] <BurdRightsActivist> @machshop "then ram the camera right up her ass"
[3:59:55] <FassieFons> eugenics for the greater good (fat asses)
[4:00:02] <peachy996> I remember reading someone describing Jacob as completely closed off the whole time and they hit the nail on the head
[4:00:03] <+FelIian> Vega was made to know nothing so that new players to ME3 could learn through him
[4:00:04] <DSD24> No mommy issues here
[4:00:06] <%justnathan18> I will say though, James is the most accurate representation of an American Marine i've seen in a game. Just a meathead that likes to party.
[4:00:09] <xhodocto385> genetics can give you the best rumps, everyone wants that
[4:00:09] <%spartanghost004> Miranda and Grunt have the same back story come to think of it.
[4:00:13] <+GingerStrawhat> @justnathan18 I mean it's litterally Freddy Prince Jr.
[4:00:13] <%bassoontyphoon> Miranda was engineered to be a super powerful biotic and still can’t succeed during the final mission
[4:00:16] <James_Quivers> She can kill MacBeth
[4:00:16] <Albedo28> ah, glad we're all talking about Miranda's super power
[4:00:18] <akitanito> so miranda is a R63 of her dad
[4:00:23] <xhodocto385> amalgam WutFace ewww
[4:00:24] <$SGrim> Then why not make a male clone?
[4:00:28] <SovPho> PHRASING
[4:00:31] <fugly_nick> Also, Jacob looks exactly like Kanye West
[4:00:32] <$SGrim> I don't get it.
[4:00:32] <FassieFons> she's her dad's femsona

[4:00:53] <+GingerStrawhat> @ComfortableStranger No I meant Fred From Scooby Doo
[4:00:55] <%ainzhelm> Vega has more personality than jacob or kaiden. His only problem is how hes shoved into the story
[4:00:57] <Broken_Sonex> So basically you're just a female version of your dad?
[4:00:59] <DatAsuna> her spirit sucks though
[4:01:00] <%justnathan18> Are we banging Miranda or what
[4:01:01] <%emperordread> But Dr Bashir, the eugenics wars ....
[4:01:01] <Pookiedaexzile> The Genetic FREAK
[4:01:01] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I imagine impostor syndrome gets real bad when you're literally designed to be perfect
[4:01:03] <+redthebaron> shepard just giving some couching
[4:01:03] <Zalapski> oh pat flirting
[4:01:04] <+FelIian> @SGrim can pair her off to someone important?
[4:01:05] <DSD24> Shepard has ashy hands
[4:01:05] <%bassoontyphoon> Shepard Jesus use moisturizer
[4:01:05] <+pmtriox> Terra Firma has more sympathetic qualities than Cerberus
[4:01:06] <CSeriesJTYPE> MIRANDA "POPPA PUMP" LAWSON
[4:01:06] <%LumberjackJack> D:
[4:01:08] <xhodocto385> yeah but our genetic freak Kreygasm

[4:01:22] <%spartanghost004> you mean the best fucking squad member in this game?
[4:01:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Mamma Pump
[4:01:24] <DSD24> Mordin the actual best teammate in this entire game
[4:01:24] <%LumberjackJack> Remember to bring Garrus for the LUL z
[4:01:25] <FassieFons> her butt is an affront to nature
[4:01:25] <%bassoontyphoon> “Personality “
[4:01:27] <muXPerience> Seriously, most people's loyalty quests in this game are some variant of 'daddy issues'
[4:01:27] <Broken_Sonex> BIG BAD BOOTY MOMMY
[4:01:29] <BlackStarAura> And UPGRADES
[4:01:30] <+pmtriox> yeah thats flirty
[4:01:31] <%spartanghost004> no
[4:01:32] <CSeriesJTYPE> MAN YOU AINT BIG POP IM THE BIG BOOTY MAMA
[4:01:34] <%ComfortableStranger> you're not locked in
[4:01:34] <%MidnightBurst12> sounded like it
[4:01:34] <%heartlesshealer> need doctor warcrimes so bad
[4:01:35] <peachy996> "LOOK AT MY GLUTES SHEPHERD !"
[4:01:36] <Dunmarkh> ye
[4:01:36] <AngryAsian5> I don't think so
[4:01:37] <NeroInfinite> a bit
[4:01:38] <+pally_din> Eh not really, not locking into anything
[4:01:38] <dd44dostivei> gross
[4:01:39] <chamblers> no
[4:01:39] <%GalacticaPhanto> Her dlc outfit should just give her a chain link hat like Scott Steiner
[4:01:39] <%KetsuoTaberu> ehh
[4:01:39] <$Faustgesicht> TBF Miranda's backstory is at least kind of interesting
[4:01:40] <AthenaAegis> You add Wrex to the mix, and your chances go down DRAMATICALLY Kappa
[4:01:40] <%bassoontyphoon> But what about Kasumi
[4:01:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yup
[4:01:41] <ape_hawk> GAR AND KASUMI
[4:01:41] <KeystoneA2> Nah.
[4:01:42] <%justnathan18> Miranda is also older than Shepard...so that hot
[4:01:46] <%LumberjackJack> You're not on the romance path yet
[4:01:46] <%spartanghost004> you can't flirt until you have loyalty
[4:01:46] <+FelIian> no
[4:01:47] <BlackStarAura> No
[4:01:47] <buhbuhboat> no flirty options until after loyalty missions
[4:01:48] <stormhawk9891> No
[4:01:48] <+GingerStrawhat> Actually I think Mass Effect 3 might have the best human crew members, maybe. Weird when I think about it
[4:01:48] <%machshop> ZAEED
[4:01:49] <%ComfortableStranger> you can flirt and not lock the romance
[4:01:49] <James_Quivers> Check garrus outfit
[4:01:50] <KeystoneA2> That comes later. Literally and figuratively.
[4:01:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> Miranda's romance is easy to trigger.
[4:01:50] <%heartlesshealer> S Link go UP
[4:01:50] <+FelIian> that's a lot later
[4:01:51] <%DashXero> She didn't give you that robo dick for nothin'.
[4:01:52] <dd44dostivei> no penis space nazi vagoo
[4:01:52] <fugly_nick> I think there's a much more obvious flirting option later
[4:01:52] <SovPho> Wait why are the missing character icons floppy disks
[4:01:52] <+Punchasaur> What the hell is up with shepherd's eyes
[4:01:54] <Albedo28> oh man, I missed Pat getting Zaheed? He loves that guy, right?
[4:01:55] <AmuserName> ANYTHING NICE is the penis option in a Bioware game, Pat!
[4:01:56] <jorniev> i wish the thing your character said to inspire people where better written instead of barely inspiring cookie cutter options
[4:01:57] <+pmtriox> Its mass effect, any dialogue where you say nice things to a character, means you're closer to fucking them
[4:01:58] <xhodocto385> genderbent clones are crazy sci-fi stuff
[4:02:04] <Burger_Bonanza> Make sure to bring Garrus when you recruit Mordin, it's WILDLY irresponsible
[4:02:04] <%spartanghost004> why will you kill garrus with the plague pat/
[4:02:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> Gamers don't know what flirting is? what a surprise
[4:02:08] <PirateMike_> Cant take Garrus to the Mordin mission @PatStaresAt
[4:02:09] <dd44dostivei> GIVE GARRUS REAL CLOTHES
[4:02:11] <Broken_Sonex> @justnathan18 Fucki i forgot about that Kreygasm
[4:02:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> @SovPho They're supposed to be tablets. The kind everyone uses in-universe.
[4:02:17] <%heartlesshealer> oooh, garrus levels
[4:02:18] <DSD24> @SovPho I think they are Dossiers actually
[4:02:20] <+Punchasaur> Where tali
[4:02:23] <$SGrim> @FelIian Engineer a daughter for diplomatic arranged marriages? Then why all the efforts in mental and biotic enhancements? Maybe she's meant to be a brood mare.
[4:02:24] <jorniev> ITS HILARIOUS
[4:02:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Someone Photoshop the Chainmail thing on Miranda
[4:02:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's also kind of fucked up to do as Shepard.
[4:02:36] <BlackStarAura> Nooooo
[4:02:36] <stormhawk9891> Shockwave
[4:02:36] <jorniev> charge
[4:02:37] <ape_hawk> shockwave is fun
[4:02:39] <+RyanTheRecluse> shockwave
[4:02:40] <+pmtriox> you want CRYO
[4:02:42] <DSD24> Shockwave!
[4:02:42] <+GingerStrawhat> Huh I don't think I've ever gotten Garrus Before Mordin
[4:02:43] <fugly_nick> Shockwave is busted
[4:02:44] <%ComfortableStranger> humans only for mordin mission
[4:02:44] <SovPho> oh you right
[4:02:44] <%spartanghost004> shockwave
[4:02:45] <tattleworm> more charge
[4:02:45] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt if you upgrade charge, it regens shields
[4:02:46] <%LumberjackJack> I say max charge first
[4:02:47] <+Krecart> save it for more charge tho
[4:02:49] <Albedo28> ragdolls are fun
[4:02:49] <Broken_Sonex> @Pookiedaexzile THIS
[4:02:49] <+pally_din> Yeah more powers is good
[4:02:50] <KeystoneA2> @FelIian She got the Solid Snake treatment in regards to fertility.
[4:02:50] <televisedrevolting> Shockwave is cool.
[4:02:52] <peachy996> Shockwave, things are already burning
[4:02:53] <Pookiedaexzile> You want charge
[4:02:54] <mutantlunchbox1> shockwave
[4:02:54] <akitanito> does ammo play well with shotguns?
[4:02:55] <Burger_Bonanza> Squad cryo ammo kinda kicks ass
[4:02:56] <peachy996> FUCK CRYO
[4:02:57] <+GingerStrawhat> Cryo is alot of fun
[4:03:02] <peachy996> Useless to your plans
[4:03:06] <DSD24> Cryo is super good
[4:03:06] <+FelIian> @SGrim no clue, doubt Bioware thought further than BOOTY LUL
[4:03:07] <%heartlesshealer> if shockwave is an aoe burst, then good
[4:03:08] <SovPho> @PatStaresAt what class are you this time around i wasn't paying attention
[4:03:13] <%LumberjackJack> Cryo ammo is fun, but inferno ammo is BAE
[4:03:16] <%KetsuoTaberu> cryo is TRAYSH
[4:03:19] <capjordo> !uptime
[4:03:19] <@Moobot> @capjordo I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 3m.
[4:03:24] <xhodocto385> BIG BOOTY because genetic amalgam
[4:03:26] <%ComfortableStranger> I believe shockwave detonates too
[4:03:26] <peachy996> It's a neat armor
[4:03:26] <Albedo28> slick
[4:03:27] <CSeriesJTYPE> @PatStaresAt dont let doc know you love garrus
[4:03:27] <Broken_Sonex> @FelIian Yeah she can't have kids
[4:03:30] <jorniev> what was cryo good for ?
[4:03:31] <James_Quivers> yay no chitty broken uniform
[4:03:32] <%QueequegTheater> His face took a fucking pounding
[4:03:32] <$SGrim> @FelIian Then the effort needed to make a Y chromosome into an X chromosome is even more wasted.
[4:03:35] <mutantlunchbox1> shiny
[4:03:35] <FassieFons> YEAH, let's give garrus space aids
[4:03:37] <fugly_nick> I don't like his mouth tubes
[4:03:38] <%hat_under_bread> cyber garrus
[4:03:42] <Albedo28> but do you have the dragon age Shepard armor?
[4:03:43] <dd44dostivei> it's more like his ME3 look
[4:03:49] <%Varlinator> fixed him up real nice
[4:03:52] <CSeriesJTYPE> LOL
[4:03:54] <%heartlesshealer> he glo
[4:03:54] <%ainzhelm> priorities
[4:03:57] <+trackles_64> Cant wait tiill  Pat meets Vega
[4:03:57] <stormhawk9891> His WHAT!?
[4:04:01] <jorniev> DOC IS JUST SUPER RIGHT
[4:04:02] <%NateyBeak> LUL
[4:04:02] <%dekkitout> Is there another semi bionic crewmate so you and your crew can be robo space cops?
[4:04:02] <%QueequegTheater> Doc is a funny guy
[4:04:02] <peachy996> Good I'm glad he understands
[4:04:02] <stantheman_97> doc is kinda crazy
[4:04:03] <%ComfortableStranger> Pat to Doc: we are a Legion supporting household here
[4:04:05] <SaltyAzteca> Credit where credit is due
[4:04:05] <+wizard_of_diamonds> wait wat
[4:04:07] <+pmtriox> he can fuck off with his shallow analysis
[4:04:09] <TourettesPlays> Never understood the point of Incendiary and Cryo ammo one the same class
[4:04:11] <DSD24> Repent the end is nigh!
[4:04:13] <Pookiedaexzile> You can fix him
[4:04:14] <mutantlunchbox1> fick in german is fuck lol
[4:04:14] <dd44dostivei> eehhh garrus is a nice fascist
[4:04:16] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[4:04:17] <DSD24> Hehehehe
[4:04:19] <fugly_nick> This batarian is the best
[4:04:20] <%spartanghost004> he is a Facist, and we are the secret police
[4:04:20] <%LumberjackJack> Sometimes you want a t h i c c Garrus
[4:04:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> Garrus isn't a fascist, he's actively against authority all the time.
[4:04:21] <ape_hawk> yeah, so?
[4:04:23] <%MidnightBurst12> still works
[4:04:23] <BlackStarAura> MORALLY GREY
[4:04:24] <KeystoneA2> No you're right, Ficke is German I think
[4:04:27] <%heartlesshealer> SOMETIMES YOU WANNA FIC
[4:04:28] <%dekkitout> Got a ubermensch in one arm and a fascist in another
[4:04:32] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Doc is a silly man with strange opinions but he was a great guest for the podcast
[4:04:36] <ScreamLord> Good for biotic shields
[4:04:36] <akitanito> I mean... it is "cyro"
[4:04:39] <+GingerStrawhat> Yeah and then you shoot them and they shatter like glass
[4:04:39] <peachy996> Double irresponsible if you bring Grunt along
[4:04:52] <peachy996> You just bring the perfect Krogan in to get sick with a Plague
[4:04:52] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Cryo ammo is Shep's exclusive power
[4:04:52] <%AncelDeLambert> cryo does extra damage after freeze, right?
[4:04:54] <%ComfortableStranger> Doc made a game while homeless, if that's not badass what is?
[4:04:56] <%heartlesshealer> they are both good
[4:04:57] <%spartanghost004> they both die
[4:05:01] <%heartlesshealer> so pick your favorite
[4:05:12] <jorniev> GRUNT just belives he is not sick
[4:05:16] <%justnathan18> Grunt is alive for like, a day, and you give him the plague
[4:05:18] <DatAsuna> If you bring 2 aliens you only get the dialogue for 1 of them
[4:05:22] <CrypticMochi> I’m trying to remember if I ever used cryo
[4:05:24] <Mattais88> What's gonna happen to Grunt, two plagues?
[4:05:27] <+trackles_64> I love the turians
[4:05:27] <peachy996> Grunt goes full denial
[4:05:27] <%QueequegTheater> Grunt is just a 40K ork
[4:05:30] <%QueequegTheater> I love him
[4:05:35] <Albedo28> big plague for grunt. Builds character
[4:05:39] <+FelIian> god ME2 male faces suck
[4:05:40] <Ultimatefool> I love Mordin :)
[4:05:42] <ScreamLord> I will be mildly pissed if we can't play an alien in ME4
[4:05:45] <%ainzhelm> @justnathan18 He's alive for a minute and you can shoot him
[4:05:55] <fugly_nick> That's an ugly Turian
[4:05:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> I doubt we'll be an alien in 4.
[4:06:01] <ape_hawk> oh, its covid
[4:06:03] <Pookiedaexzile> A COUGH
[4:06:06] <%dekkitout> D:
[4:06:09] <DSD24> That's hilarious
[4:06:12] <Hairy_butts> monkaS
[4:06:12] <+xerotwo> monkaS
[4:06:13] <zerointelligence000> Plague does seem to love aliens
[4:06:16] <DSD24> Then I shoot you
[4:06:18] <%justnathan18> I wish we could give Garrus a silly turian hat like that
[4:06:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Vorcha Best boys
[4:06:21] <Hellarussian> hmm
[4:06:23] <+xerotwo> This is too real monkaS
[4:06:23] <+redthebaron> big vorcha racism
[4:06:23] <%QueequegTheater> HMMMMM monkaS
[4:06:25] <Mattais88> collectors
[4:06:25] <Albedo28> Vorcha, fuck those guys. Worst race. Totally not a racist thing
[4:06:26] <%ainzhelm> Its actually a cricket plot
[4:06:28] <akitanito> nah, too obvious
[4:06:29] <ape_hawk> nah, its totally the vorcha
[4:06:29] <%Torus1025> Absolutely
[4:06:32] <peachy996> It's actually a Collector plot
[4:06:37] <%LumberjackJack> Aw, yeah, Alien COVID
[4:06:37] <%dekkitout> It does, given what happened to the krogans
[4:06:39] <HaroldDonchee> ehh I got the space covid
[4:06:43] <SovPho> I hear Vorcha can't swim
[4:06:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's the vorcha working for the collectors yeah.
[4:06:45] <peachy996> "COLLECTORS WANT PLAAAAGUE"
[4:06:46] <+redthebaron> THE VORCHA
[4:06:46] <LeotheHuntsman> Vorcha = goblins?
[4:06:50] <buhbuhboat> It's the reapers fault, if not THEN it's cerberus
[4:06:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> But the aliens assume it's the humans.
[4:06:51] <%ComfortableStranger> collectors paying vorcha for plague spread
[4:06:53] <%MidnightBurst12> all disease?
[4:06:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Vorcha are best boys, they suck, and are worm people who barely live past 20
[4:07:01] <James_Quivers> It's to encourage you to bring the cerberus crewmates along for just one mission before you dump them
[4:07:07] <Pookiedaexzile> They suck and they still made it to space
[4:07:12] <DatAsuna> Oh no
[4:07:18] <Albedo28> trust me
[4:07:23] <SovPho> cerberus: *muppet sideye*
[4:07:24] <Albedo28> I'm a nice guy
[4:07:25] <DSD24> I always went for Mordin first
[4:07:25] <peachy996> If you let me in I swear I won't loot
[4:07:26] <%DracosMagala> LUL
[4:07:26] <ScreamLord> It took a LOT of monkey fucking before AIDs jumped over to humans
[4:07:27] <fugly_nick> I've been playing Andromeda, and Turians look so bad in that game
[4:07:27] <%dekkitout> @Pookiedaexzile Live fast, die awesome
[4:07:28] <+JaseAdrift> LUL
[4:07:30] <Mattais88> though gassing a colony and hurling it at a planet is a very Zeon, I mean, Cerberus thing to do
[4:07:32] <%ainzhelm> I solve practical problems
[4:07:39] <FassieFons> cerberus humans eugh
[4:07:43] <jorniev> LET ME IN, IM A SPECTRE
[4:07:44] <alroy900> honestly, that wouldn't be beyond us to make a plague against other species
[4:07:44] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Bring the Cerberus crewmates just to switch to Zaeed and Kasumi in front of them
[4:07:48] <%KetsuoTaberu> you don't have a black hole launcher, lady
[4:07:50] <%ComfortableStranger> stuck in quarantine, none of us know how that feels
[4:07:51] <BurdRightsActivist> RONA monkaS

[4:08:20] <DatAsuna> HE JUST got out of surgery
[4:08:21] <ScreamLord> Neither does SHepard right now, but a bazooka that shoot blackholes is almost as good
[4:08:21] <Archmortal> Garrus, you've been putting off your vaccinations long enough
[4:08:22] <+robuttastic> PAT NO :(
[4:08:22] <%AncelDeLambert> ... just put your helmet on, Garrus
[4:08:22] <fugly_nick> What a bro
[4:08:22] <Ultimatefool> Pat you ass
[4:08:23] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Garrus is also very recently very injured
[4:08:23] <SaltyAzteca> AWKWARD
[4:08:24] <%machshop> Kreygasm
[4:08:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> Ridiculously irresponsible.
[4:08:25] <%king_wragles> Garrus, just put your fucking mask on you asshole
[4:08:25] <Seth_Tek> clip it!
[4:08:26] <%Cozy90> CUM

[4:08:30] <BurdRightsActivist> IT'S JUST A FLU
[4:08:30] <James_Quivers> GARRUS REFUSES TO WEAR A MASK
[4:08:31] <TioXyco> he would, but that would kill you probably
[4:08:31] <%hat_under_bread> psaWrong
[4:08:33] <Dunmarkh> welcome to the cum zone garrus
[4:08:34] <%KetsuoTaberu> @muxperience flackNice
[4:08:34] <+FelIian> I like the idea of the Dextro/Levo amino acids stuff, but it's way overblown
[4:08:35] <%LumberjackJack> Someone tell Paige that Pat is trying to kill Garrus
[4:08:35] <%ainzhelm> priorities
[4:08:36] <%bread_assassin> Garrus is such a bro.
[4:08:36] <$SGrim> POISON THE COP
[4:08:36] <+titansloth93> please don't give Garrus Covid
[4:08:37] <+MrAtheGreat> ... Is Pat gonna give Garrus the Corona so he can fuck him?
[4:08:37] <arkv01> its okay surgery gave him new cybernetic balls
[4:08:38] <BlackStarAura> Evil
[4:08:38] <%Garthunox> Pat i can believe you hate garrus so much you'd let him get sick
[4:08:40] <%Kemmybelle> and also go on the mission
[4:08:41] <%pokefan9956> is garrus an anti-masker
[4:08:44] <+FelIian> Chirality won't kill you
[4:08:46] <peachy996> Like imagine if Mordin had no cure for that plague
[4:08:47] <televisedrevolting> Yeah this should be fine.
[4:08:48] <+FelIian> well in food
[4:08:48] <akitanito> staaahp
[4:08:49] <%heartlesshealer> sound byte
[4:08:50] <+pmtriox> probably the worst mission to bring kasumi on
[4:08:51] <%machshop> can't he just put his helmet on
[4:08:52] <Blank9> listen garrus NEEDS to attend this rally
[4:08:53] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I mean, he is a cop after all Kappa
[4:08:55] <Blank9> it's his right
[4:08:55] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Why doesn't Garrus just seal up his space armor?
[4:08:56] <$Faustgesicht> Only cum
[4:08:57] <%ComfortableStranger> the cum zone is near the hot zone
[4:08:59] <Draco_Renegade> Why doesn't he just wear his helmet?
[4:09:01] <%dekkitout> Garry, you were fine wearing a mask as Archangel, wtf?
[4:09:01] <%Monkeyweed21> Did pat talk to Aria again?
[4:09:02] <%DianaTheAscian> so is he already sick?
[4:09:03] <DatAsuna> concussive shot is lame
[4:09:07] <HaroldDonchee> only cum inside turian girls
[4:09:08] <%Shubreaker> only cum inside
[4:09:11] <spuginky> in anime girls
[4:09:13] <peachy996> Love the ambient theme to Mordin's Mission
[4:09:13] <SovPho> PatStaresAt superspreader event
[4:09:15] <James_Quivers> Remember, you're making him do this RIGHT AFTER HE ALMOST DIED TO A MISSILE TOO
[4:09:15] <intestinal_bleeding> shockwave is definitely rule of cool
[4:09:17] <%pokefan9956> I need to see garrus wearing a MAGA hat
[4:09:19] <%Monkeyweed21> GROUND WAVE
[4:09:19] <stantheman_97> only cum inside anime girls
[4:09:24] <Basch71> reppuken
[4:09:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> Shockwave is some anime shit.
[4:09:32] <capjordo> Garrus put your fucking mask on goddamnit
[4:09:35] <Albedo28> arent turians like allergic to human jizz?
[4:09:39] <SkinnyRite> Just arrived. I see we missed out on recruiting grunt
[4:09:40] <dd44dostivei> need flame ammo
[4:09:42] <%Torus1025> Ye
[4:09:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Become as Geese
[4:09:49] <peachy996> Other way around Albedo
[4:09:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Powers have a universal cooldown in this game.
[4:09:56] <+redthebaron> @Albedo28 reverse
[4:09:56] <+FelIian> only come in Turian Girls, and don't lick out Quarian Girls
[4:09:59] <%dekkitout> @Albedo28 Wasnt Turian dude splooge acidic?
[4:10:04] <akitanito> why doesn't garrus just wear his helmet
[4:10:05] <jorniev> IT so weird that garrus just doesnt wear his helmet
[4:10:06] <Botman_R> That's what I did.
[4:10:06] <%ComfortableStranger> @Albedo28 correct they are dextro based so it would be bad
[4:10:07] <Albedo28> @Albedo28 danke
[4:10:08] <fugly_nick> Just use the wheel for everything
[4:10:12] <seniormeatbox> set it and forget it
[4:10:17] <%emperordread> set n 4get
[4:10:17] <+Buzzkill983> You're throwing a shockwave with right hand. It makes sense
[4:10:18] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt I just took the ammo powers off the triggers completely
[4:10:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Set it and Forget it Applause
[4:10:46] <SaltyAzteca> Nailed it
[4:10:47] <DatAsuna> I got lvl 1 everything before maxing
[4:10:49] <ScreamLord> Garrus would be fine if he wore his helmet
[4:10:50] <muXPerience> Thankfully, science has proven that the dextro incompatability is overstated in the mass effect serires
[4:10:53] <%dekkitout> @FelIian You will not stop the thorough tonguing down
[4:11:01] <DSD24> I wish there was a station called Alpha in ME
[4:11:04] <capjordo> psaUp
[4:11:05] <Profmcstevie> This quarantine has a Spectres endorsement
[4:11:08] <peachy996> I think you come back to this particular district in Omega DLC
[4:11:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Garrus is an Antimasker
[4:11:15] <SaltyAzteca> Kasumi just watching
[4:11:17] <%LumberjackJack> *kissy kissy*
[4:11:17] <%ComfortableStranger> no clue why you are playing it on a controller, steam version plays with mouse and keyboard
[4:11:19] <%ainzhelm> oh god someone is going to draw fanart now
[4:11:20] <+capnbeefs> Stop molesting the turian
[4:11:21] <%walternatorz> you're killing him
[4:11:25] <%Monkeyweed21> Garrus put on a helmet
[4:11:30] <SkinnyRite> My kisses will protect you from the plague
[4:11:32] <PirateMike_> How could someone who loves Garrus bring him here?!
[4:11:35] <+FelIian> @ComfortableStranger there is (was?) a massive debate online about whether Dextro "juices" would be bad
[4:11:36] <FassieFons> he can't be space fascist if he's gay
[4:11:37] <+pmtriox> did you have a stroke? what the fuck?
[4:11:39] <time2getsweaty> oh shit, he dead
[4:11:40] <akitanito> why?
[4:11:44] <fugly_nick> we'll bang, okay?
[4:11:46] <SaltyAzteca> REPPUKEN
[4:11:47] <Albedo28> biotic charge is so awesome
[4:11:58] <DSD24> Watch Pat kill this Batarian
[4:12:04] <%OldOnyx> hell there's even real research in to dextro based sweeteners if they aren't already on the market now
[4:12:07] <akitanito> smells like BBQ
[4:12:07] <%ComfortableStranger> @FelIian only one way to find out!
[4:12:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Garrus: I  will not put on a Helmet, Filtered air will kill brain cells, The virus is a hoax
[4:12:22] <%ainzhelm> orange space purple
[4:12:39] <%QueequegTheater> No
[4:12:48] <ape_hawk> bioshock infinite had a good one
[4:12:51] <fugly_nick> Dead Space had the best version of that
[4:12:53] <Albedo28> yay heavy weapon
[4:12:59] <%dekkitout> @Pookiedaexzile Garry, you've EVA'd in space- you wore a helmet as Archangel
[4:13:02] <$Faustgesicht> You know I love about games? Injured batarians
[4:13:02] <xhodocto385> BBQ? at least it isnt fast food LUL
[4:13:03] <%G_Thunders> I forgot how awesome Garrus was. But this game is what, over a decade old now?
[4:13:06] <Profmcstevie> Big sign that says this way? I shall ignore it for loot
[4:13:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> Dead Space let you pet your ghost dog.
[4:13:08] <%pokefan9956> garrus says "build that wall"
[4:13:12] <xhodocto385> you dont want to know what happened with Mcdonalds
[4:13:15] <SaltyAzteca> Breadcrumbs were the best @fugly_nick
[4:13:17] <%Varlinator> any game that gives you a path on the floor is the best
[4:13:23] <SkinnyRite> @fugly_nick is the most right this conversation is over
[4:13:27] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> Omega News Network: *Ex-cop dies after refusing to quarantine, was recorded saying "I won't let a cough stop me" *
[4:13:37] <+FelIian> @OldOnyx yea because we wouldn't absorb anything from them but still taste the sweetness, so would be like 0 calorie sugar with no downside?
[4:13:40] <%ComfortableStranger> Crazy talk haunts Dead space
[4:13:42] <+FelIian> iirc
[4:13:44] <%DashXero> "I'll be frank. I'm not a fan."
[4:13:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> Oh just wait.
[4:13:48] <James_Quivers> Garrus is borderline suicidal anyway
[4:13:50] <Pookiedaexzile> He'd be fine in a helmet
[4:13:50] <Sol_Install> MAN
[4:13:52] <%Monkeyweed21> at least wear a helmet Garrus
[4:13:52] <%hat_under_bread> "Fuck it. My bro says it's important."
[4:13:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> He hasn't started coughing yet.
[4:13:57] <ape_hawk> "ITS JUST THE FLU, ITS JUST THE FLU"
[4:13:57] <Broken_Sonex> He said it was your call, right?
[4:13:57] <%pokefan9956> what if garrus just died
[4:13:58] <%rkbinder> This hit different post 2020
[4:13:58] <peachy996> Oh that's a weird way to do this
[4:13:58] <BlackStarAura> Sigh
[4:13:59] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt Garrus himself is laughably irresponsible, so it's fine.
[4:14:01] <%Treuan> God this hits different
[4:14:01] <dd44dostivei> that terminal is armed!
[4:14:02] <fugly_nick> This audio log works just as well for COVID
[4:14:03] <%Jeemukun> boy this hits different now
[4:14:03] <muXPerience> @CarpeDeezKnuts I've had enough of these disingenuous assertions
[4:14:05] <+iAmAceGaming> ohh is that the black hole gun? @PatStaresAt
[4:14:05] <%OldOnyx> thats the idea, yeah
[4:14:05] <SaltyAzteca> Funny enough this isnt the last irresponsible thing Shepard done
[4:14:06] <dreu81> why doesnt garrus just put on his space helmet
[4:14:08] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Garrus is an Antimasker or else he'd be wearing his helmet
[4:14:14] <%pokefan9956> fuck this is too real
[4:14:16] <%G_Thunders> “I love you, but I’m not programmed to be gay since you’re aren’t either yet.”
[4:14:20] <%LumberjackJack> Oh boy, this mission hits different in 2021
[4:14:22] <%ComfortableStranger> @ScreamLord LOL
[4:14:25] <akitanito> true
[4:14:26] <%ainzhelm> Local Roof Turian contracts Rona
[4:14:26] <ThatGuyThere03> CORRECT
[4:14:26] <SaltyAzteca> TOO REAL
[4:14:26] <iosephe> holy shit
[4:14:27] <peachy996> Man this section is pretty awkward now
[4:14:28] <%crazyspartan214> OH NO!!!!!
[4:14:28] <+Ropcord> LUL
[4:14:28] <ammobasket> ohoho
[4:14:28] <%Crookedspiral> LUL
[4:14:29] <%LumberjackJack> LUL
[4:14:32] <jorniev> YUP
[4:14:33] <%enickma11> NO SHUT UP
[4:14:33] <LluthyY> Oh god...lol
[4:14:33] <$SGrim> @ScreamLord PERFECT
[4:14:35] <%OldOnyx> oh, NO
[4:14:37] <stantheman_97> LUL
[4:14:37] <%LumberjackJack> DON'T RUIN GARRUS FOR ME, YOU FUCKS
[4:14:38] <buhbuhboat> about as irresponsable as bring Legion to Tali loyalty mission
[4:14:38] <Sol_Install> man this is too fucking real now
[4:14:38] <%heartlesshealer> being second player and watching friend freak out on his first playthrough while idly reacting to visuals and collide with empty space was great
[4:14:40] <%MidnightBurst12> oh no
[4:14:42] <DatAsuna> garrus is more worried about 5G
[4:14:43] <%Monkeyweed21> THE MASK IS JUST COUNCIL BUREACRACY
[4:14:43] <%heartlesshealer> OH NO
[4:14:43] <%dekkitout> He took it off to prove a point
[4:14:45] <Broken_Sonex> "IT'S A CONSIPRACY SHEPARD!"
[4:14:48] <Pookiedaexzile> He doesn't like Filtered AirIt'll kill his brain cells
[4:14:49] <BurdRightsActivist> HE'S A COP TOO, IT MAKES SENSE
[4:14:52] <PirateMike_> how could you do this Pat? I thought you loved garrus
[4:14:52] <usuallysleepy> anti masker was a term that literally didn't exist when this game was made, what a shitty world
[4:14:52] <James_Quivers> Gaarrus stole Nancy Pelosis podium and keeps it in his house
[4:14:54] <%pokefan9956> IM UNCOMFORTABLE
[4:14:56] <Pookiedaexzile> The Virus is a Hoax
[4:14:56] <%machshop> nobody thought anyone could be that dumb in 2010
[4:14:57] <xhodocto385> KKona its all fake news Kappa maybe
[4:14:58] <+Ropcord> HELMETS ARE A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY
[4:14:59] <Profmcstevie> Masks remind me of red tape
[4:15:02] <%Treuan> Well gee, that's sad
[4:15:04] <fugly_nick> This log is actually from Earth 2020
[4:15:10] <%ainzhelm> I wonder if this was foreshadowing for a certain thing that happened in a certain country
[4:15:11] <SaltyAzteca> :(
[4:15:11] <%dekkitout> Oh god- is Garry cool with joining Cerberus to prove everyone else is wrong too?
[4:15:13] <%ComfortableStranger> @buhbuhboat you get cool dialog from doing that, especially with the admirals
[4:15:14] <+Buzzkill983> Breath the air real deep in there
[4:15:14] <Kerisato> FeelsBadMan
[4:15:15] <%Varlinator> Why does this sound so real?
[4:15:18] <+iAmAceGaming> nah some people should die alone
[4:15:19] <Albedo28> yay, when you're crazy, you bring your own friends!
[4:15:24] <DatAsuna> when do the rat tornados come in?
[4:15:24] <ScreamLord> Tali would be fine tho
[4:15:25] <James_Quivers> Very funny actually
[4:15:29] <+Ropcord> LUL .oO( FeelsBadMan cvMask )
[4:15:29] <SkinnyRite> weirdchamp moment right there
[4:15:31] <usuallysleepy> dont worry masks dont work anyway Kappa
[4:15:32] <+Punchasaur> I HAVE MY RIGHT TO NOT WEAR A MASK AND I HAVE MY RIGHT TO DEFEND MYSELF
[4:15:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Masks remind me of Csects rules, Justice is unfiltered like the air
[4:15:38] <+bubblebasspickles> good thing this could never happen in real life
[4:15:38] <Too_Much_Nukie> Man it's gonna be like 10 years before people can enjoy plague fiction again.
[4:15:39] <Dunmarkh> put him out of his misery
[4:15:40] <%YakumoYomi> It's almost as funny as when you streamed RE6 last February~
[4:15:41] <DatAsuna> you deserve it batarian
[4:15:43] <peachy996> Be paragon to this one
[4:15:44] <+pally_din> Remember last year when you were playing RE6 and they talked about the "C-virus" like right as this shit was starting out
[4:15:47] <SkinnyRite> Makin a looooot of assumptions here batarian
[4:15:51] <fugly_nick> Pat's gonna ignore the paragon prompt
[4:15:52] <%pokefan9956> FUCK
[4:15:52] <+FelIian> are we china?
[4:15:55] <xhodocto385> KOKONAWE the virus is all a conspiracy KOKONAWE KKona Kappa
[4:15:55] <%MugenSandan> hahaaaa this would never happen in real life therefore I can laugh HAHAAAAAAAAA
[4:15:58] <%pokefan9956> THIS IS TOO REAL
[4:15:59] <DatAsuna> R2
[4:16:01] <stantheman_97> kill him four-eyed scum
[4:16:01] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> The Chinese created the plague in their labs
[4:16:02] <Broken_Sonex> MAAAAAN THIS SHIT HIT DIFFRENT IN 2021
[4:16:02] <SkinnyRite> Murk this four eyed fuck
[4:16:03] <LluthyY> good thing things like that could never happen, right?
[4:16:07] <alroy900> a batarian as no possession, it deserves nothing
[4:16:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt If you let this guy die you can loot 2000 credits off his corpse
[4:16:09] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt remember last year when covid hit and then RE3R came out and that beginning cutscene
[4:16:10] <+pmtriox> fuck the batarian shit
[4:16:21] <conchthechimera> God forbid Plague starts fooling around with all the space women and causes a disease Kappa
[4:16:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> Awwww too late to show Pat my leet strats
[4:16:22] <SaltyAzteca> Good guy Shepat
[4:16:24] <SkinnyRite> no~
[4:16:28] <%ComfortableStranger> pat just gave him heroine
[4:16:28] <%LumberjackJack> Wait, how?
[4:16:32] <Goatllama> it's a dose of deez
[4:16:35] <%YakumoYomi> Now shoot him in the face
[4:16:35] <peachy996> This one is at least grateful for your help
[4:16:37] <Parapattern> "Garrus, get really close to him."
[4:16:37] <Albedo28> big bald hero
[4:16:38] <jorniev> i dont know how to feel about all this
[4:16:42] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> I'm here to Bald
[4:16:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's a dose of medi-gel.
[4:16:43] <DSD24> Balding Pat
[4:16:44] <usuallysleepy> oh no a vaccine you just killed him
[4:16:45] <%G_Thunders> Remember when the opening of RE3R used live action news segments to talk about the viral pandemic, like two weeks into quarantine?
[4:16:45] <%emperordread> I let him die on purpose lol
[4:16:45] <%Nekros4442> He threw medigel at his face
[4:16:46] <HaroldDonchee> why are you helping a filthy batarian
[4:16:47] <Goatllama> but are you retired and green?
[4:16:49] <buhbuhboat> saving batarians WutFace
[4:16:50] <+Ropcord> just slap medigel on the plague
[4:16:50] <%heartlesshealer> telekinetic injection???
[4:16:55] <%pokefan9956> @goatllama Deez?
[4:16:59] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> He's magnetic now
[4:16:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Because my Horseshoe cut comoforts you
[4:17:01] <logothete2401> This level sure feels different now that we're living in a plague.
[4:17:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah if you let him die you get 2000 credits.
[4:17:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> So...
[4:17:05] <%LumberjackJack> How does medi-gel delay a virus?
[4:17:10] <xhodocto385> HE IS THE ONLY INNOCENT
[4:17:12] <BlackStarAura> Because Shep’s not an asshole? Sometimes
[4:17:12] <blakeway> pat brought garrus? gjshhags
[4:17:13] <alroy900> pat, don't save the batarian, they might reproduce
[4:17:16] <$SGrim> I don't know if I can cure this plague, so I've infected one of my closest friends to motivate myself to do it.
[4:17:17] <Dunmarkh> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[4:17:18] <+Qexec> How topical
[4:17:23] <Broken_Sonex> @G_Thunders That was wild

[4:17:28] <+Fooguwu> This is actually gonna happen btw :)
[4:17:28] <%Nekros4442> Medi-gel does fucking everything in Mass Effect
[4:17:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Vorcha SCIENCE
[4:17:33] <+FelIian> @heartlesshealer omni-tool fabricator applies medi-gel somehow?
[4:17:35] <ape_hawk> VORCHA CANT SWIM
[4:17:38] <xhodocto385> monkaS OH NO monkaS the future is here foks
[4:17:38] <%hat_under_bread> Yeah. Create a new conspiracy theory.
[4:17:39] <akitanito> so they have a diversion you fool
[4:17:39] <%ComfortableStranger> @dd44dostivei no that comes later
[4:17:40] <fugly_nick> Bringing Garrus here should instantly fill your Renegade bar
[4:17:41] <%Nekros4442> Need a blood transfusion? Here's some medigel
[4:17:42] <%ainzhelm> @SGrim What is this, a shonen jump story?
[4:17:42] <DatAsuna> vorcha-19
[4:17:43] <Broken_Sonex> "IT WAS MADE IN A LAB SHEPARD, I'M TELLING YOU!"
[4:17:47] <%LumberjackJack> @Too_Much_Nukie LUL
[4:17:47] <%heartlesshealer> @Fellian maybe...
[4:17:50] <SaltyAzteca> There's always ONE scientist Vorcha
[4:17:51] <%ComfortableStranger> Warf is on Tuchunka
[4:17:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Vorcha Mix up the sick real good
[4:17:54] <+Punchasaur> BITCH DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE SMALLPOX KILLED
[4:17:56] <%pokefan9956> you ever just bring your immunocompromised buddy to a trump rally just for fun?
[4:17:56] <peachy996> @dd44dostivei Worf is actually in this. He voices a Krogan
[4:18:02] <%dekkitout> Vorcha and humans dont share like 12% genes, do they
[4:18:03] <+pally_din> Aren't vorcha basically space goblins
[4:18:08] <peachy996> Gatatog Uvenk I think
[4:18:11] <T_Sasquatch> the vorcha would totally agree that they arent smart enough
[4:18:20] <+Fooguwu> we already have made world-ending diseases in labs, we're just lucky they haven't leaked yet. Yet

[4:18:24] <arkv01> @peachy996 that is rad
[4:18:25] <ScreamLord> Vorcha evolved so hard in 1 direction that they stopped evolving and will never get smarter naturally
[4:18:26] <+senfood> Damn, Mordin's a badass.
[4:18:28] <akitanito> oh god, he's a bioterrorist!
[4:18:28] <+FelIian> Vorcha are basically walking, breathing tumors
[4:18:30] <$SGrim> @SGrim Masaka Effect?
[4:18:31] <$Futurecity10> Based
[4:18:32] <%ComfortableStranger> @peachy996 I forgot he had a first name
[4:18:37] <SkinnyRite> Mordin - "Never see me coming"
[4:18:37] <+GamerWorlock> Vorcha don't have space travel yet. They stowaway on ships
[4:18:37] <Albedo28> dude! I forgot that mordin pulls a Vlad
[4:18:39] <NeroInfinite> That's pretty fucking metal
[4:18:39] <+Buzzkill983> Vlad the Impalered them
[4:18:41] <KeystoneA2> Chad doctors do
[4:18:45] <xhodocto385> Vorcha just want FLESH
[4:18:45] <$Faustgesicht> Mordin's so fucking cool
[4:18:47] <%Varlinator> Clearly never played Dead By Daylight
[4:18:51] <fugly_nick> Mordin fucking rules
[4:18:55] <+Punchasaur> Ultimate bio weapon
[4:19:01] <usuallysleepy> what if we just put heads without masks on sticks outside of hospitals
[4:19:07] <SkinnyRite> Garrus sweating bullets near this infected guy LUL
[4:19:08] <%ComfortableStranger> @GamerWorlock they can do calculus tho, says so in the codex
[4:19:08] <xhodocto385> Vorcha had nothing to do with this
[4:19:08] <%LumberjackJack> Doesn't Tali have unique dialogue for being brought to this mission, too? Can't do it conventionally, obviously, but I think I remember an old YouTube vid showing
[4:19:08] <Pookiedaexzile> I just got it
[4:19:12] <peachy996> @ComfortableStranger I think it's because some of these names sound so cool to me I still remember a few 10 years later
[4:19:14] <LluthyY> garrus like "shepard please hurry"
[4:19:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Vorcha are a race of Cunos
[4:19:20] <Oxybe> Space Covid doesn't mess around.
[4:19:23] <%ainzhelm> The way forward is dangerous. Take this
[4:19:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> @LumberjackJack She does yes.
[4:19:30] <%dekkitout> @usuallysleepy Vlad 'The Inoculator' Tepes
[4:19:31] <Essixian> Batarians are surprisingly poetic
[4:19:33] <Albedo28> flicker of hope before he dies anyway. Cause that's what good guys do
[4:19:34] <xhodocto385> there is no hope for you batarian pig

[4:20:12] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> You did this to him
[4:20:12] <%heartlesshealer> =)

[4:20:14] <AEnemyStandUser> yo I forgot about the hacking Mini-Game in this game
[4:20:15] <akitanito> i told you
[4:20:17] <%justnathan18> HE DIDNT WEAR A MASK
[4:20:18] <Parapattern> Die for me Garrus
[4:20:19] <alroy900> that's a VERY quick infection
[4:20:21] <stantheman_97> no garrus BibleThump
[4:20:22] <%bassoontyphoon> psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon
[4:20:23] <NeroInfinite> A mask isn't going to save him from this.
[4:20:24] <$SGrim> Garrus must die
[4:20:24] <%dekkitout> YOU DID THIS! Now Kelly will have to nurse him back to full health
[4:20:24] <+FelIian> welp no Garrus in ME3 now LUL
[4:20:24] <blue8moon> how could you do this to him BibleThump
[4:20:25] <muXPerience> You deserve renegade points for taking him with
[4:20:25] <PirateMike_> How could you do this Pat
[4:20:25] <xhodocto385> KKona no masks in usaland Kappa
[4:20:26] <ScreamLord> What did I say?
[4:20:28] <+Buzzkill983> Loot hole
[4:20:28] <%walternatorz> LOL
[4:20:29] <Albedo28> Pat is here to kill your husbando
[4:20:29] <peachy996> Man Mass Effect 2 is so cool
[4:20:31] <Zalapski> I can't believe garrus is fucking dead
[4:20:32] <BlockingDisabled> Kasumi looks like a Mortal Kombat character IMO
[4:20:37] <fugly_nick> You see what happened to that Batarian? That's gonna be Garrus real soon
[4:20:48] <DSD24> Wow you took that guy's money
[4:20:49] <%ComfortableStranger> @BlockingDisabled kinda
[4:20:53] <%DashXero> Renegade options are supposed to be risky - not idiotic.
[4:21:03] <%ainzhelm> @PatStaresAt There should be an option like "what are you, a pussy?"
[4:21:04] <%pokefan9956> imagine if bioware just killed off garrus if you do this
[4:21:08] <Zalapski> see chat, pat is just trying to teach us a lesson about pandemic safety :)
[4:21:11] <Broken_Sonex> Every time Garrus coughs you should get +5 renegade
[4:21:17] <peachy996> Garrus and Grunt catch the plague really quick too like holy shit you just walked in
[4:21:21] <DSD24> I hear it
[4:21:24] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Play that log again
[4:21:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> Why do I have to quarantine if I don't even feel sick????
[4:21:27] <%ComfortableStranger> @Zalapski yeah thats it...
[4:21:28] <%walternatorz> that's just Garrus coughing
[4:21:29] <+Punchasaur> You should get renegade points for giving covid to your teammates PAT
[4:21:34] <%hat_under_bread> My favorite part is people denying they have the plague.
[4:21:41] <$SGrim> Steal dead peoples' possessions, while raiding their homes. Captaining a rogue ship outside traditional government authority? Shepard's a SPACE PIRATE!
[4:21:41] <%pokefan9956> when does Q show up?
[4:21:50] <SaltyAzteca> Ballsy
[4:21:54] <%ainzhelm> @peachy996 Its a matter of ventilation. Like how those cruise lines everyone got sick really fast
[4:22:04] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt BTW Biotics don't go through shields
[4:22:20] <%ComfortableStranger> @SGrim if you don't steal an item, the dev that put the item there wasted their time
[4:22:20] <Dova573> Dreamin Dont give it up SHEPARD
[4:22:27] <Albedo28> le sadness for biotics
[4:22:29] <+Ropcord> @pokefan9956 shadow broker dlc
[4:22:31] <rReizs> mmmm delicious thermal clips for your weapons that could fire infinitely beforehand
[4:22:32] <SkinnyRite> @patsraesat you actually learned that in ME1 LUL
[4:22:38] <%ainzhelm> no
[4:22:38] <stormhawk9891> Nope
[4:22:41] <+Desthanos> Yeah playing as a biotic in ME2 on insanity is just gimping yourself because everyone has at least armor.
[4:22:42] <ScreamLord> My internet is shitting itself right now
[4:22:44] <%maskedsongbird> Hey y'all, I'm a bit late to the stream today. What's going on, folks?
[4:22:45] <+Pugweight> @PatStaresAt how you liking 2
[4:22:46] <+FelIian> Laughs in Sentinel: "What shields"
[4:22:48] <DatAsuna> barriers
[4:22:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> No, but warp works on armor.
[4:22:49] <tattleworm> gotta be on their last bar for biotics to lift them
[4:22:54] <%LumberjackJack> YEARS
[4:22:55] <stormhawk9891> Biotics only work on red health
[4:22:56] <DatAsuna> and not all biotics
[4:22:57] <%ainzhelm> an enemy will not be ragdolled if they have armor, shields or barrier
[4:23:00] <DatAsuna> only warp and reave
[4:23:08] <fugly_nick> Incendiary armor works on armor I think
[4:23:15] <AmuserName> In ME1, Biotics go through everything. In ME2, biotics only have FULL effect on hp, but have limited effect on Armor, Shields, Barriers.
[4:23:16] <fugly_nick> *Incendiary ammo
[4:23:17] <+FelIian> Man Reave is OP in this game
[4:23:21] <%ComfortableStranger> @ainzhelm correct
[4:23:22] <peachy996> Yes
[4:23:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> Just read the descriptions on the powers to know if it'll work on the guy.
[4:23:22] <%bread_assassin> 2 is technically yearS.
[4:23:29] <Albedo28> time to scare some randos
[4:23:31] <+Punchasaur> The Masked of Us
[4:23:31] <Goatllama> why are you playing this when you could be playing Star Wars Droidworks
[4:23:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ainzhelm yes but there is usually days of incubation if a virus shows its hand this quick it won't really succeed in spreading
[4:23:46] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> Jesus, imagine being attacked by a group of people cuz they think your race created a virus based on no evidence. Thank God this is only fiction
[4:23:50] <%hat_under_bread> Look at that sick Udina outfit.
[4:23:51] <%Shubreaker> I played Insanity as a vanguard and has a fuckin blast
[4:23:57] <%maskedsongbird> Oh we're still pretty early in ME2. Neat!
[4:23:59] <fugly_nick> These guys look way too high class for this area
[4:24:04] <HaroldDonchee> man I thought that was Udina for a sec
[4:24:11] <+FelIian> @hat_under_bread Professional Cosplayer right there
[4:24:13] <%ainzhelm> @doc_ock_rokc This isnt covid. They didnt say it needs a days long incubation
[4:24:14] <%maskedsongbird> @CarpeDeezKnuts Oof, that's a little too real.
[4:24:16] <DatAsuna> it doesn't help that aria keeps going on the holonet calling it the human virus
[4:24:19] <%newtype89> newtype89 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[4:24:19] <akitanito> same clothes after all
[4:24:21] <%LumberjackJack> @CarpeDeezKnuts Oooof
[4:24:21] <$SGrim> So like the anti-chinese racism in the US following the orange man's proclamations.
[4:24:23] <FassieFons> be racist against the vorcha, not us!
[4:24:26] <Mattais88> Young Udina cosplay
[4:24:30] <%dekkitout> How do these fuckers not know what disease vectors are? Regardless of where ever the disease came from
[4:24:31] <%ainzhelm> Its also explicately manufactured
[4:24:33] <%QueequegTheater> He's like halfway between Udina and Bashir from DS9
[4:24:33] <%pokefan9956> china created the varrus /s
[4:24:34] <sekihoe> all hoomans lookalike
[4:24:41] <+Punchasaur> Look at this man’s UFC face
[4:24:43] <Albedo28> man, the vorcha are just getting shit on by everyone
[4:24:47] <xhodocto385> humans did it Kappa
[4:24:50] <+Ropcord> KKona dang humans shouldnta' ate that batarian
[4:24:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Best boys mix the best sick
[4:24:59] <%pokefan9956> even with sarcasm I feel like an asshole just saying that
[4:25:00] <+Buzzkill983> OOF
[4:25:03] <fugly_nick> The vorcha never had a chance of being taken seriously
[4:25:04] <dd44dostivei> Shepard! Do you have any idea how much trouble you're creating for me??!!!!
[4:25:09] <peachy996> Ooooooooffffff
[4:25:12] <akitanito> garrus is ded
[4:25:13] <slix3431> Pat inject yourself with it as a powermove
[4:25:23] <%LumberjackJack> OOOOOOOOF, FUCK, TOO REAL
[4:25:26] <%ainzhelm> @pokefan9956 They say worse things about us
[4:25:32] <TheIronBrass> God this part is even more depressing now
[4:25:34] <+Ropcord> monkaS
[4:25:39] <logothete2401> Oh man this hits for real
[4:25:41] <%pokefan9956> garrus just puking blood in the background
[4:25:41] <slix3431> I remember this
[4:25:46] <Zalapski> garrus totally not freaking out hearing all this
[4:25:47] <Broken_Sonex> Man, this got real huh?
[4:25:48] <Albedo28> burning bodies hasn't been all that useful to fight plagues since the dark ages
[4:25:48] <peachy996> Hey but we're not burning people at least
[4:25:54] <%hat_under_bread> This man's cheekbones are so high they're returning to their home planet.
[4:25:56] <peachy996> W-we still have that right?
[4:26:00] <+Ropcord> yet
[4:26:01] <SkinnyRite> Does the male refugee sound like G Man to anyone?
[4:26:03] <BlockingDisabled> hazvsCRY
[4:26:06] <jorniev> i wonder if this is whats happening with the gangs in my country
[4:26:13] <fugly_nick> @peachy996 Have you seen what's going on in Israel?
[4:26:14] <slix3431> Vorcha suck
[4:26:25] <+FelIian> Does Mordin have cure for Covid too?
[4:26:25] <%ainzhelm> omfg
[4:26:31] <BlackStarAura> Fuck you, random dude. Mordin’s cool
[4:26:31] <+FelIian> Or Stupidity
[4:26:32] <SaltyAzteca> popopop
[4:26:32] <+Punchasaur> Seriously what is going on with the lighting around shepherd’s eyes
[4:26:34] <peachy996> @fugly_nick pls no
[4:26:43] <%LumberjackJack> LUL A REAL Omega doctor would charge me, what a FAKE
[4:26:44] <DSD24> That sounds hype
[4:26:50] <%QueequegTheater> Murder is badass
[4:26:52] <sekihoe> Mordin rules
[4:26:54] <+Buzzkill983> He's protecting humans. Can we trust him?
[4:26:55] <+Ropcord> @Punchasaur he has special eyes
[4:26:56] <sekihoe> best character
[4:26:57] <slix3431> @PatStaresAt Would you accept surgery from a mech?
[4:27:06] <%ainzhelm> @LumberjackJack A REAL omega doctor would rob me
[4:27:13] <%maskedsongbird> Mordin totally rules.
[4:27:18] <+FelIian> He IS the model of a scientist Salarian
[4:27:23] <CheeseBurgerHelper> Salarians may be the worst race in the entire galaxy, but Mordin is absolutely one of the best characters in the series
[4:27:36] <%ainzhelm> Wake up in a bathtub of ice
[4:27:39] <Albedo28> I can't help you, but really putting you in danger isn't any worse than leaving you, right?
[4:27:47] <%kujofire990> Steal their money
[4:27:51] <DSD24> Don't Salarians live till 60?
[4:27:53] <%LumberjackJack> Just gonna steal your money now, k thx
[4:27:55] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Burgled, not robbed

[4:28:05] <%maskedsongbird> @DSD24 40
[4:28:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> Salarians are the lalaFel of Mass effect
[4:28:08] <%LumberjackJack> @DSD24 I think it's 40, actually
[4:28:09] <%ComfortableStranger> @DSD24 more like 40
[4:28:10] <%Monkeyweed21> @DSD24 40
[4:28:12] <+FelIian> about 40 yea
[4:28:13] <logothete2401> That apartment is unreasonably nice for a shithole like Omega
[4:28:14] <+Buzzkill983> Captain Kirrahe and Mordin put the entire Salarian race on their backs
[4:28:16] <xhodocto385> please end this WutFace the coughs sound too real
[4:28:20] <DSD24> Damn that's rough
[4:28:23] <+FelIian> Think Mordin is about the same age as Shepard
[4:28:35] <Broken_Sonex> All the coughing in the background man.......
[4:28:43] <xhodocto385> this is the most depressing area in the the entire series
[4:28:44] <+FelIian> they grow up quick though
[4:28:44] <%ComfortableStranger> I'm 37, if I was a salarian I would be elderly
[4:28:54] <SaltyAzteca> yeaaaaaaaaaaaah

[4:31:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @fugly_nick Imagine if they slided back and then tryed to melee you if you charged them
[4:31:48] <peachy996> Depends if the Krogan was wearing a helmet
[4:31:52] <DSD24> @doc_ock_rokc Probably contracted under the Vorcha
[4:31:53] <s1rcuit> didn't know Vorcha territory was the space between fucking walls
[4:31:54] <peachy996> If not he was stupid
[4:31:57] <peachy996> SAve
[4:31:57] <%maskedsongbird> Charge is like my favorite move. That's why I always go vanguard, get right up in into their grill and it's come on and SLAMMMM!!!
[4:32:02] <slix3431> Pat Join the space WAAAGH! and become the paunch
[4:32:03] <%MonsterEnvy> Vorcha are the Space Goblin lackies.
[4:32:05] <Albedo28> looters are bad. Kill them then loot them
[4:32:06] <%pokefan9956> looting toilet paper
[4:32:06] <TourettesPlays> all games need the Postal 2 solution to clipping into walls
[4:32:08] <DSD24> Time for Patshep to be a huge hypocrit
[4:32:09] <Botman_R> Does Pat know about the charge shot for the Geth Shotgun?
[4:32:14] <xhodocto385> its always the space goblin bugs everywhere

[4:32:37] <fugly_nick> I don't like looters, says a looter
[4:32:38] <+Krecart> the sheer hypocrisy of that lol
[4:32:38] <DatAsuna> Only SHEPARD can steal from the dead
[4:32:38] <%miguelrod777> BUT SHEOARD WE STEAL FROM THE DEAD
[4:32:39] <%AncelDeLambert> these two have protagonist syndrome
[4:32:39] <%ainzhelm> ok woolie
[4:32:41] <%QueequegTheater> "we're just protesting the quarantine"
[4:32:43] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> kill them for looting, and then immediately loot
[4:32:46] <+EmptyMug> Only "I" can loot the dead
[4:32:47] <Sol_Install> want to know what effect humans?

[4:33:03] <%LumberjackJack> DAMN IT
[4:33:06] <peachy996> Renegade has the better line
[4:33:10] <SkinnyRite> Looter no looting! Looter no looting! Looter no looting!
[4:33:13] <%maskedsongbird> Don't like looting? But you're an RPG protagonist!
[4:33:15] <peachy996> "If I have to...Do I have to?"
[4:33:16] <%42nfl19> I thought @PatStaresAt was playing tired man renegade?
[4:33:17] <DSD24> So much better
[4:33:18] <%dekkitout> That was probably the most paragon thing you said all night
[4:33:21] <%pokefan9956> "what are you gonna do. shoot me?" man who was shot
[4:33:23] <xhodocto385> RPG CASH LUL
[4:33:23] <Parapattern> What you are doing is badong
[4:33:52] <James_Quivers> All this happened in ONE WEEK'
[4:34:00] <+FelIian> did Pat start this before or after the money patch?
[4:34:13] <%maskedsongbird> I like how he taps his head, to really emphasize how little they thought it through, lol
[4:34:14] <%Monkeyweed21> @FelIian after
[4:34:16] <+meikae> after
[4:34:21] <%AncelDeLambert> I must come up with the opposite of killing: "gnodab"
[4:34:30] <%ComfortableStranger> "I don't like looting" *proceeds to loot the apartment *
[4:34:30] <BlackStarAura> ΥΕΑ η
[4:34:49] <HaroldDonchee> man mordin is so cool
[4:34:51] <%maskedsongbird> What he really means is that he doesn't like that the looters got there first.
[4:34:57] <MrPandastic> WHY WOULD YOU TRY TO ROB A DOCTOR THAT FIXED YOU FOR FREE
[4:34:57] <s1rcuit> man if I knew a badass doctor like that existed in my area I'd make them my primary care provider
[4:35:06] <stormhawk9891> Eh, I would have shot them even as a Paragon
[4:35:08] <intestinal_bleeding> i mean there's A LOT of game ahead of you
[4:35:11] <intestinal_bleeding> so there's room for more
[4:35:12] <peachy996> It goes up slower than 1
[4:35:12] <+FelIian> @ComfortableStranger *whisperers to self* "without a noble cause*
[4:35:14] <%miguelrod777> bc you keep doing renegade stuff
[4:35:14] <%QueequegTheater> Pat you're at 40% before leaving Omega
[4:35:15] <James_Quivers> Bruh it's almost halfway and you're on the second mission
[4:35:15] <Pookiedaexzile> You haven't done much
[4:35:18] <%maskedsongbird> Mordin's basically a better version of Cumberbatch's Sherlock.
[4:35:18] <+meikae> there's a lot of game left..
[4:35:19] <s1rcuit> @MrPandastic because scum is dumb
[4:35:22] <buhbuhboat> you've done like 1 mission
[4:35:25] <SkinnyRite> @MrPandastic LUL
[4:35:27] <Albedo28> paragon is pretty slow because you get a lot of +2 that dont benefit from the 40% increase
[4:35:28] <%ComfortableStranger> @FelIian lol
[4:35:28] <intestinal_bleeding> don't worry pat you'll be the omega good boy you want to be
[4:35:29] <+pally_din> you've been passing all the paragon checks anyway
[4:35:35] <Parapattern> "I'm a healer, but..." *cocks gun*
[4:35:46] <+lucaflowe> Paragon and renegade take forever to level in 2 and 3
[4:35:48] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt it doesnt multiply your paragon score, it multiplies your current paragon
[4:35:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Mordin Did Battle Mercy first
[4:36:05] <satans_finest_millennial> even mercy has a pistol
[4:36:05] <buhbuhboat> big paragon check you need is the Jack/Miranda clash
[4:36:05] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[4:36:05] <%Plus_On_Black> @patstaresat Is "Aliens" an derogatory term in this game? Wouldn't the humans are the aliens in this scenario?
[4:36:11] <+DrGecko> Uh oh, space germs
[4:36:15] <%QueequegTheater> START PLAYTHROUGH OVER LUL
[4:36:21] <+pally_din> It's fine
[4:36:28] <%pokefan9956> one guy
[4:36:33] <akitanito> that sounds really useless
[4:36:33] <%QueequegTheater> Pat's fault for minmaxing Kappa
[4:36:40] <peachy996> Oh no not the mechs
[4:36:42] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt without it you literally cant get past the second line, its a realyl stupid system
[4:36:47] <%Garthunox> @pokefan9956 im right tho
[4:37:10] <%athuramn> because that's not how that works lol? it just scales up your points received to the amount shown.
[4:37:11] <%machshop> this Mordin guy sounds so cool
[4:37:14] <peachy996> Do it
[4:37:25] <Essixian> #NotAllHumans, okay
[4:37:26] <%QueequegTheater> They were protesting Kappa
[4:37:27] <%ComfortableStranger> Carnifex is actually really good
[4:37:28] <ape_hawk> #NOTALLHUMANS
[4:37:29] <James_Quivers> ONLY WE'RE ALLOWED TO LOOT SAYS THE BATARIAN
[4:37:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Its a Hard Knock life
[4:37:30] <%heartlesshealer> during a plague?
[4:37:33] <Pookiedaexzile> For Us
[4:37:34] <%athuramn> and I'm pretty sure it's retroactive so it doesn't matter when you get it
[4:37:36] <seniormeatbox> Gee mordin is a good guy I hope nothing bad happens to him in the last mission
[4:37:36] <Parapattern> Give 'im a big smoocharoonie
[4:37:38] <%machshop> yep
[4:37:41] <s1rcuit> on MY way here I saw at least two Batarians, amazed I kept my dinner down
[4:37:44] <+MrAtheGreat> Yeah. That's sucks all the ass
[4:37:48] <$Faustgesicht> go left first
[4:37:49] <stormhawk9891> THERE HE IS
[4:37:51] <+HelloImTom08> yea and there bearly any to begin with
[4:37:52] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA\
[4:37:56] <Essixian> I LOVE HIM
[4:37:56] <SaltyAzteca> THE BEST. GATDAMNED. SALARIAN.
[4:37:56] <FassieFons> BEST BOI
[4:37:57] <jorniev> did he miss some loot?
[4:37:57] <+ScrapKingKeita> Salarians sure go at a mile a minute, huh?
[4:37:58] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> You can respec later, so you can apply that 20% Paragon increase to a larger pool later
[4:38:01] <s1rcuit> he's so cool
[4:38:01] <Chaos_Aether> yeahhhhhhhhhhhh
[4:38:02] <%maskedsongbird> Oh the slaver Batarian hates that there are humans looting. Eh, he can go fuck himself.
[4:38:02] <xhodocto385> its MORDINNNN
[4:38:02] <DSD24> The best
[4:38:03] <TourettesPlays> I think they show up in stores if you miss them
[4:38:05] <stantheman_97> THE BOY
[4:38:07] <James_Quivers> Dude hasknowledge just pourin out
[4:38:08] <%heartlesshealer> yeyeye
[4:38:11] <DatAsuna> da scientist salarian
[4:38:11] <+Desthanos> @PatStaresAt have you probed Uranus yet?
[4:38:14] <$Solid_Stro> *Inhale*
[4:38:15] <intestinal_bleeding> wecanusethis
[4:38:18] <Reverend_Godshyne> One thing 3 did better is it gives you the ability to buy shit that you missed in a mission
[4:38:20] <BlackStarAura> Loot the shit out of this room
[4:38:20] <televisedrevolting> How old is Mordin?
[4:38:24] <$Faustgesicht> Legit might be the best written character in the series
[4:38:25] <xhodocto385> can the coughing just stop WutFace
[4:38:25] <%MonsterEnvy> @maskedsongbird No proof that Batarian is a slaver.
[4:38:27] <televisedrevolting> I never found out.
[4:38:27] <%luckysteak> SHEPARD IS LOOTING FROM THE CLINIC
[4:38:31] <DSD24> My Xenosciene studies....
[4:38:31] <seniormeatbox> STUDIED SPECIES VORCHA TURIAN ASARI AND BATARIAN
[4:38:33] <ShadowRedgrave> i thought you only played good games????
[4:38:35] <seniormeatbox> he is 36
[4:38:36] <s1rcuit> damn, really?
[4:38:37] <televisedrevolting> THAT'S SO OLD.
[4:38:40] <CheeseBurgerHelper> Old man Mordin
[4:38:41] <Reverend_Godshyne> Late 30's I thought
[4:38:42] <peachy996> He's pretty old
[4:38:42] <%heartlesshealer> SingsNote
[4:38:44] <conchthechimera> Salarians die usually at like 40ish
[4:38:46] <James_Quivers> Mordins loyalty mission is straight up one of the best moral quandries I've seen in a game
[4:38:53] <s1rcuit> @seniormeatbox he's still doing pretty good
[4:38:55] <seniormeatbox> @PatStaresAt he's 36
[4:38:56] <conchthechimera> they got them fast metabolisms
[4:38:57] <%maskedsongbird> Okay but no joke, I would LOVE a full version of Scientist Salarian--like the whole song.
[4:38:58] <peachy996> I think he's the oldest Salarian that you know of
[4:39:00] <%ainzhelm> meanwhile you have a thief stealing nothing
[4:39:00] <xhodocto385> Looting like an jrpg anime protagonist
[4:39:03] <stantheman_97> late 30's so he's elderly
[4:39:13] <DatAsuna> ignored
[4:39:13] <%Papa_Bearman> 36 is still ancient for a salarian.
[4:39:14] <Reverend_Godshyne> my man, there he is
[4:39:16] <SaltyAzteca> YEE
[4:39:17] <xhodocto385> hello frogfish face
[4:39:18] <%machshop> he fixed our boy!
[4:39:20] <AngryAsian5> PROBLEM SOLVED LUL
[4:39:23] <SkinnyRite> WOO Garrus need NO mask
[4:39:25] <DSD24> Look how instant that was
[4:39:27] <%maskedsongbird> @peachy996 What about that salarian shopping with his Asari stepdaughter on Illium?
[4:39:28] <+MrAtheGreat> Garrus  got 5g BABEEEEEEE
[4:39:28] <+ScrapKingKeita> THIS GUY TALKS LIKE BEN SHAPIRO
[4:39:29] <slix3431> Way to bring Garus asshole
[4:39:32] <SaltyAzteca> YES YES
[4:39:32] <%ComfortableStranger> @James_Quivers and its super important for ME3 unlike most endgame choices
[4:39:33] <%hat_under_bread> Bro Mordin immediately treating Garrus.
[4:39:34] <+DrGecko> Is this guy Alien Sheldon
[4:39:34] <mak0t0yukii> ES CURE
[4:39:34] <%AzureGale> Yeah this guy cool
[4:39:35] <%machshop> YES YES
[4:39:36] <fugly_nick> I hear Mordin broke the one rule of Omega
[4:39:40] <Parapattern> I LOVE HIM
[4:39:43] <televisedrevolting> Mordin talks fast cause he's old and will die.
[4:39:43] <HaroldDonchee> man mordin you're kinda crazy
[4:39:45] <Albedo28> removing your points from the class spec removes proportional renegade and paragon points, pointing to it effecting score earned even after its chosen.
[4:39:47] <+flexin_apex> The best character
[4:39:48] <CheeseBurgerHelper> Mordin is such a good character
[4:39:50] <$Faustgesicht> Average life span is 30 for a salarian
[4:39:50] <%luckysteak> best lizard
[4:39:50] <peachy996> @maskedsongbird Possibly
[4:39:52] <James_Quivers> These camera angles LMAO
[4:39:58] <jorniev> cerberus
[4:39:58] <SaltyAzteca> Just take it in chat
[4:39:59] <$Solid_Stro> You can see the age on Mordin’s face
[4:39:59] <seniormeatbox> Mordin is the best
[4:40:02] <%AncelDeLambert> I forgot how neurotic he is
[4:40:03] <ShadowRedgrave> WHERE IS PAGE N HER MCDONALDS?
[4:40:03] <%GinAndRoses> i love you mordin
[4:40:04] <%QueequegTheater> @Faustgesicht 40
[4:40:04] <%JoshManVGH> I love this warcime alien man.
[4:40:04] <%MonsterEnvy> @Faustgesicht 40 I think
[4:40:05] <AmuserName> His speech patterns are so excellent.
[4:40:07] <stantheman_97> i love him
[4:40:08] <alroy900> love mordin
[4:40:09] <peachy996> Listen to that music, so good
[4:40:11] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> Mordin is Bioware best character they've ever written
[4:40:12] <xhodocto385> he speaks in Speed Racer dialogue LUL
[4:40:15] <%heartlesshealer> <3
[4:40:16] <Essixian> OOOO
[4:40:16] <LluthyY> Mordin is just the best lol
[4:40:19] <DSD24> I never saw this
[4:40:19] <James_Quivers> THAT SECRET DIALOGUE MMMMMMMMMM
[4:40:22] <DatAsuna> Big worth it
[4:40:24] <+EmptyMug> Fun fact, all alien companions have voice lines for the plague despite some being impossible to get this early.
[4:40:25] <+Desthanos> I like how if you choose the other option he deduces that it's Cerberus immediately.
[4:40:27] <xhodocto385> in early dubs of japanese anime the characters speaks too fast
[4:40:37] <James_Quivers> ME2 is replayable as hell
[4:40:37] <SkinnyRite> Missing Grunt *sad face*
[4:40:39] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt wait doesn't he guess correctly when you do the other option?
[4:40:39] <s1rcuit> @HaroldDonchee a 36 year old Salarian with medical and military training working 'round the clock trying to stop a plague/treating people and you'd be crazy too
[4:40:40] <Broken_Sonex> *I N H A L E*
[4:40:41] <+trackles_64> this plauge mission is so topical
[4:40:47] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt The renegade dialogue there is great
[4:40:49] <xhodocto385> monkaS
[4:40:55] <Albedo28> killing Garrus was worth that extra sentence.
[4:40:56] <DSD24> The best pistol
[4:40:58] <peachy996> There's a ton of little things that happen in conversations depending on who you take
[4:40:59] <seniormeatbox> BEST GUN IN THE FRANCHISE
[4:41:00] <+meikae> do they ever explain the protective bar all salarians wear across their chest?
[4:41:02] <xhodocto385> kill the goblins
[4:41:03] <DatAsuna> the best non DLC pistol
[4:41:03] <$Solid_Stro> *Inhale* Need to kill them… sabert14Gun
[4:41:04] <%machshop> Daniel monkaS
[4:41:05] <Essixian> I SHOULD GO
[4:41:06] <Reverend_Godshyne> that's a good pistol
[4:41:07] <+DrGecko> Mordin is like fast yoda
[4:41:08] <slix3431> HE FUCKIN DED
[4:41:10] <$Faustgesicht> Oh and my favorite pistol. Sick
[4:41:12] <+FelIian> Mordin's Shadow Broker Dossier is AMAZING btw
[4:41:14] <DSD24> Gotta save Spiderman
[4:41:16] <TheIronBrass> These camera angles are so good
[4:41:16] <alroy900> I love how fast he speak
[4:41:16] <$Memdosu> its fast speaking rigby
[4:41:16] <conchthechimera> I mean, on top of his metabolism, Mordin's a smart bugger. His brain is prolly running faster than a dual turbo
[4:41:16] <televisedrevolting> The Pontifex is strong.
[4:41:17] <DatAsuna> nah phalanx is better
[4:41:18] <%dekkitout> Why is Mordin as Speed Racer now stuck in my head
[4:41:19] <%heartlesshealer> "bonus in good faith"
[4:41:19] <Broken_Sonex> *I N H A L E*
[4:41:22] <stormhawk9891> @seniormeatbox No that's the Phalanx
[4:41:30] <%ainzhelm> hmmm
[4:41:33] <slix3431> OOOOF
[4:41:33] <intestinal_bleeding> o-oh

[4:41:50] <%AncelDeLambert> humans are... new
[4:41:52] <slix3431> Intergalactic Respritory systems
[4:41:55] <Dova573> Sounds like super cancer
[4:41:56] <Hairy_butts> I love mordin
[4:41:58] <DSD24> @CSeriesJTYPE Nah its just his armor
[4:42:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Humans too different
[4:42:03] <%JohnAtDawn> Humans have races
[4:42:07] <SaltyAzteca> Humans are complex
[4:42:09] <xhodocto385> humans are so diverse HELL YEAH KKona
[4:42:10] <ammobasket> humans too diverse, can't collect them all
[4:42:10] <peachy996> Humans are so special
[4:42:13] <Profmcstevie> Humans strong
[4:42:14] <+pally_din> Mordin HATES vorcha
[4:42:16] <%AncelDeLambert> oh yeah, in this universe, Earth is INSANELY biologically diverse
[4:42:18] <James_Quivers> I love how Mordins just INSTANTLY figures out why Collectors are targeting humans
[4:42:19] <xhodocto385> see humans are the best in the galaxy
[4:42:20] <MrPandastic> Yeah, there's no way they can put in future Salarian party members. Mordin is WAY too good.
[4:42:21] <slix3431> Humans are superior
[4:42:21] <ioci2112> humans are built different
[4:42:24] <SkinnyRite> Yes, Mordin is also a vorcha racist
[4:42:30] <+HelloImTom08> vorcha are pretty gross tho
[4:42:33] <alroy900> humanity best
[4:42:33] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> Humans are built different, virus can't hurt them
[4:42:34] <+lucaflowe> Human too different annoying to hax
[4:42:41] <televisedrevolting> Mordin has had a long tenure in Salarian Spec Ops.
[4:42:42] <slix3431> Vorcha are dumb as fuck lol
[4:42:43] <%luckysteak> I could listen to him talk all day. He needs a "bill nye-esque" tv show
[4:42:43] <CSeriesJTYPE> I think he has robot hands
[4:42:44] <%MonsterEnvy> Vorcha are Space Goblins
[4:42:45] <fugly_nick> I never noticed that
[4:42:46] <peachy996> Also the scars
[4:42:48] <buhbuhboat> yeah you find out about that in shadow broker dossiers
[4:42:50] <SkinnyRite> Thick scars on his face too
[4:42:50] <%maskedsongbird> Why are humans like the only species known for massive amounts of genetic diversity? Like--for example--isn't the whole point of the Asari reproductive strategy to improve genetic diversity?
[4:42:51] <%MonsterEnvy> and also the ultimate speicies
[4:42:51] <%dekkitout> Humans and vorscha are literally built different- huh...
[4:42:54] <DatAsuna> @DatAsuna yeah but 3 has the m-11 and the paladin
[4:42:55] <AEnemyStandUser> one of my favorite companions in Mass Effect 2 is Morton
[4:42:57] <Albedo28> he also has a bunch of shrapnel injuries on his head
[4:42:57] <%heartlesshealer> *slaps Earth* This baby can hold so much diverse forms of life
[4:42:57] <dd44dostivei> i like the human diversity trait in canon, so that humans aren't just average about everything
[4:43:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Everyone took Shepards Sexy Scars
[4:43:06] <$Solid_Stro> Vorcha are immune to all diseases, too bad it’s the Vorcha c4sageLUL
[4:43:08] <SaltyAzteca> SUGEEEE
[4:43:10] <James_Quivers> *SNIFFFFFFFF*
[4:43:11] <SkinnyRite> *I N H A L E*
[4:43:12] <LeotheHuntsman> A nice detail for Mordin, he has a lot of wrinkles, he *looks* old
[4:43:12] <DSD24> The confidence
[4:43:12] <stormhawk9891> HE'S SO COOL
[4:43:12] <+iAmAceGaming> haha so fucking cool!!!
[4:43:17] <Broken_Sonex> *I N H A L E*
[4:43:18] <%JohnAtDawn> YEEEEEEEAAAAAHHHHHH
[4:43:18] <xhodocto385> the Asari are trying to be more diverse than humans maybe
[4:43:20] <fugly_nick> Mordin even says he loves the challenge of managing so many plague vitcims
[4:43:20] <+FelIian> HE KILLED THE KROGAN RESPONSIBLE WITH A GOD DAMN PITCHFORK THOUGH
[4:43:21] <sekihoe> Mordin is so fucking cool
[4:43:21] <%JohnAtDawn> CARNIFAX
[4:43:23] <+pally_din> Ehhhh I always preferred the default pistol
[4:43:28] <TourettesPlays> Vorcha are fungus people so they're literally a lower life form
[4:43:29] <seniormeatbox> the fact that mordin DOESN'T have a romance option is the worst part of the series
[4:43:31] <+black_pariah> mordin's wallet has bad motherfucker on it
[4:43:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why is he so fucking cool
[4:43:38] <Lamokmok> Nice pistol
[4:43:39] <%JohnAtDawn> IT IS
[4:43:42] <$Solid_Stro> Vorcha live to their late 20s right? sabert14Sip
[4:43:46] <peachy996> I preferred the Default pistol for better rate of fire
[4:43:47] <%machshop> LUL
[4:43:47] <+DrGecko> Same
[4:43:48] <+trackles_64> He does have one doesnt he
[4:43:48] <%AncelDeLambert> he's also OOOOOOOOLD
[4:43:50] <PinkSocks> yeah salarians have no romance concept
[4:43:50] <slix3431> Can you eat the pile?
[4:43:52] <DSD24> Also he's not into that
[4:43:53] <%42nfl19> BUT THAT CAN BE YOU @PatStaresAt
[4:43:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TourettesPlays are you saying Vorcha are ORKS
[4:43:54] <+HelloImTom08> they dont really do romance LUL
[4:43:54] <televisedrevolting> @seniormeatbox They don't have time to fuck they die quick
[4:43:56] <+ScrapKingKeita> He's also like, a Great GDILF
[4:43:57] <%ainzhelm> with a TOS on the birth certificate
[4:43:57] <peachy996> Mordin will think you're hitting on him tho
[4:43:58] <%GinAndRoses> when you think about it femshep is just a big pile of eggs
[4:43:59] <xhodocto385> Vorcha are mold goblins KEKW
[4:43:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> He is also like a grand0a
[4:44:00] <%heartlesshealer> are fungi a lower lifeform or simply more patient? Plants use fungal networks to communicate
[4:44:01] <+Fooguwu> ill throw my eggs on the floor i dont care
[4:44:02] <Mattais88> we learn that this game, on illium
[4:44:02] <set29> like chicken eggs?
[4:44:03] <logothete2401> Salarians dont do romance
[4:44:04] <James_Quivers> Mordin has already banged every race, he's done
[4:44:07] <slix3431> Renegade move. Cum on his eggs
[4:44:07] <intestinal_bleeding> haha eggs
[4:44:07] <peachy996> If you romance nobody, he'll think you're into him
[4:44:08] <%MonsterEnvy> @Solid_Stro Lucky to reach 20s
[4:44:08] <DatAsuna> don't we all?
[4:44:11] <blakeway> if you try/ don't romance anyone he lets you down easy
[4:44:12] <%AncelDeLambert> the Vorcha are Orks
[4:44:12] <mutantlunchbox1> fertilize my clutch daddy
[4:44:13] <%dekkitout> Well cant YOU be the egg pile?
[4:44:14] <xhodocto385> mold goblins that stopped envolving long loooong ago
[4:44:14] <TourettesPlays> Mordin bang Aria tho
[4:44:16] <%AncelDeLambert> WAAAAAA!
[4:44:17] <Jane_Lo> @seniormeatbox you can romance quite the old dude in dragon age thought, but he ain't close to mordin's personality
[4:44:20] <%QueequegTheater> I wish I were eggs
[4:44:20] <Pookiedaexzile> If you fucked a Salarian you would be wasting a big percentage of their life
[4:44:21] <dd44dostivei> they just stand and gloop
[4:44:21] <alroy900> salarians don't have time for romance
[4:44:22] <%miguelrod777> vorcha are literally just big worms
[4:44:23] <%sunsetdisc0> salarians are asexual and bone down for reproductive purposes
[4:44:23] <%maskedsongbird> Wasn't there a lady in ME3 that had a crush on a Salarian coworker, though? Like, she bought him a bunch of armor and stuff. Or am I misremembering that?
[4:44:24] <HaroldDonchee> carnifex is such a badass sounding name
[4:44:24] <%machshop> @set29 no, salarian eggs you silly
[4:44:25] <FassieFons> i want mordin to nut on my eggs
[4:44:26] <%MonsterEnvy> @AncelDeLambert More Goblins fromt he build
[4:44:26] <Albedo28> stealing 100 credits from the clinic. What a good paragon
[4:44:27] <SkinnyRite> Mordin - Commander Shepard wanna see how hard I can N U T
[4:44:28] <+FelIian> Explicitly stated that Salarians don't feel sexual attraction the same
[4:44:29] <fugly_nick> Apparently he banged Aria though
[4:44:30] <%logoth_> like a can of paint
[4:44:32] <Broken_Sonex> Didn't Mordin fuck Aria?
[4:44:35] <+pally_din> psuedo-mugnum
[4:44:35] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You're aware Mordin came on Aria, yes
[4:44:36] <+iAmAceGaming> omg a mordin and sheppard baby
[4:44:37] <tanarath> mordin doesn't have a romance option because bioware are cowards.
[4:44:37] <+HelloImTom08> it feels like a Magnum
[4:44:38] <SovPho> I wonder what Salarian school is like
[4:44:41] <%maenos2> how can you say yhou love mordin if you won't cum on his eggs
[4:44:44] <set29> @machshop well thats no fun
[4:44:45] <DSD24> Wait Mordin fucked Aria?
[4:44:46] <xhodocto385> Salarians can't bang? FeelsBadMan
[4:44:47] <+iAmAceGaming> would be the most badass baby ever
[4:44:50] <NeroInfinite> The Carnifax will take you REAL far
[4:44:54] <jorniev> ARIA is an asari
[4:44:54] <%Monkeyweed21> Asari do mindsex with anyone @Broken_Sonex
[4:44:55] <ingman112> That’s an exaggerated story y’all
[4:44:57] <Broken_Sonex> @DSD24 Sure did
[4:45:00] <DatAsuna> wait till you get the phalanx pistol tho
[4:45:02] <SkinnyRite> @fellian I know a certain asari stripper that can change that ;)
[4:45:03] <%ComfortableStranger> you cant spell delatras without dat ass
[4:45:03] <peachy996> Mordin mentions that some other species have come on to him before
[4:45:06] <%QueequegTheater> Guys stop mentioning Aria, that's a Citadel thing
[4:45:12] <DSD24> Damn what a hero
[4:45:14] <ingman112> Aria doesn’t know him super well, remember? It’s just a noir parody
[4:45:35] <peachy996> Even mentions Krogan deviants who like Salarian flexibility so make of that what you will
[4:45:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Shiney and chrome
[4:45:52] <%ComfortableStranger> @QueequegTheater you mean the omega me3 dlc?
[4:46:00] <CheeseBurgerHelper> krogans and salarians sounds like a recipe for disaster
[4:46:01] <%QueequegTheater> Man he took that plasma blast to the face pretty well
[4:46:02] <peachy996> Considering Krogan women are most likely always on Tuchanka
[4:46:05] <%machshop> did Kasumi just do a Steve Urkel line
[4:46:07] <xhodocto385> nuttier than krogan quads
[4:46:08] <%QueequegTheater> @ComfortableStranger ...maybe
[4:46:11] <%ComfortableStranger> Aria is Trinity
[4:46:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Witness!
[4:46:16] <%maskedsongbird> I don't think I've ever used that gun you've got. What's up with that thing? It's pretty cool.
[4:46:22] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> umm miranda is better than kasumi cause she has warp
[4:46:29] <SkinnyRite> That was a mistake
[4:46:31] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Charge gives you a barrier
[4:46:32] <Albedo28> big mistake
[4:46:33] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[4:46:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> Twitch gave me the McDonald's ad that doesn't have Twitch in it again.
[4:46:42] <dd44dostivei> femshep gets a krogan mating request after grunts loyalty
[4:46:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> It hurts more each time.
[4:46:44] <CurrentQuiet> !uptime
[4:46:44] <%QueequegTheater> Better than nothing
[4:46:44] <peachy996> Put your balls away Commander
[4:46:44] <@Moobot> @CurrentQuiet I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 47m.
[4:46:46] <%ComfortableStranger> shockwave wastes the GCD
[4:46:47] <Pookiedaexzile> WITNESS!
[4:46:48] <DatAsuna> Kasumi is good once you level her
[4:46:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> *Doesn't have Paige in it
[4:46:55] <%athuramn> that's how the charge mechanic works
[4:46:56] <%AncelDeLambert> 75% is pretty chunky
[4:46:59] <Profmcstevie> This ability of rushing into open territory seems to be working out :)
[4:47:00] <AmuserName> It currently restores half your shields PER CHARGE
[4:47:03] <+FelIian> tbh I never liked the shotguns in Mass Effect
[4:47:05] <+TheFlyingChurro> @maskedsongbird That's the Geth Plasma Shotgun, you can charge it for big damage
[4:47:05] <slix3431> Pat use your balls
[4:47:07] <%athuramn> it's only usable because it gives a good barrier
[4:47:11] <Pookiedaexzile> TO VORCHALLA
[4:47:18] <slix3431> Use your space balls
[4:47:21] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Big balls, a lot of danger, too many enemies *INHALE*..... Game Over
[4:47:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> Does Pat know he can take out the flamethrower guys by shooting their tanks?
[4:47:23] <fugly_nick> @dd44dostivei Can humans have Krogan babies?
[4:47:24] <AmuserName> oh, still 25%
[4:47:32] <%heartlesshealer> dump orb
[4:47:43] <%watts121> charge isnt op till me3
[4:47:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> Does Pat know that Overload instantly explodes the flamethrower guys if their armor is gone?
[4:47:45] <dd44dostivei> @dd44dostivei nah
[4:47:49] <%QueequegTheater> @fugly_nick according to some video research...yes
[4:47:50] <%ComfortableStranger> @Too_Much_Nukie more of a ranged strat
[4:47:50] <peachy996> Nah but the Krogan breeding request is just comedic thing
[4:47:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @fugly_nick No
[4:47:56] <%luckysteak> man, shockwave is only good against husks
[4:48:03] <peachy996> It's there for a chuckle
[4:48:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> I just took a shower so I've missed every previous attempt at this room.
[4:48:25] <%AncelDeLambert> wow, 50% of your shield back instantly sure would be nice around now
[4:48:33] <%ComfortableStranger> @peachy996 EDI: "and one for shepard" grunt: "HA!"
[4:48:45] <DSD24> Lucky your punch went through
[4:48:47] <%Gamblitz> Lol
[4:48:49] <slix3431> BAHAHAHAH
[4:48:49] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[4:48:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah when I play vanguard I use the pistol on those pyro guys.
[4:48:52] <%AncelDeLambert> HAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[4:48:53] <DSD24> That was a good spot!
[4:48:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Flesh and Fire to the end
[4:48:56] <Too_Much_Nukie> That's a returning bug.
[4:48:56] <+Desthanos> What a corner camper
[4:48:56] <peachy996> Lol I love this game

[4:49:01] <NeroInfinite> LUL
[4:49:04] <DSD24> Smartest thing I've seen a Vorcha do
[4:49:05] <PirateMike_> Bad vorcha!
[4:49:05] <+Fooguwu> genius vorchumbo
[4:49:06] <%DianaTheAscian> I WOULD TAKE THAT SPOT
[4:49:06] <+StillNotFabio> Don’t forget to save your credits for The Pickles @patstaresat, you’ll need to eat a lot for the suicide mission.
[4:49:08] <slix3431> Big Finkin
[4:49:11] <dirtyh4rr1> good ol counter strike tactics
[4:49:12] <dd44dostivei> he cheated by fighting super hard for his life
[4:49:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Best Boys
[4:49:14] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Dapper_Cactuar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! I hope Legendary Edition is treating you well, wondering how many of the beneficial bugs are still in the trilogy
[4:49:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> Sometimes if an enemy gets stuck on the geometry like that they'll keep screaming forever.
[4:49:15] <Pookiedaexzile> They Suck
[4:49:20] <%maskedsongbird> I wonder how the Krogan breeding request thing would even work if Shepard took them up on it. Aren't they basically lizards?
[4:49:21] <xhodocto385> that Vorcha almost got you LUL
[4:49:26] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Cleaver girl
[4:49:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> @maskedsongbird They apparently still have vaginas not cloacas.
[4:49:50] <%maskedsongbird> Come to think of it, they mention that Krogan genophage causes stillbirths---I guess the Krogan don't lay eggs, then...
[4:49:51] <xhodocto385> @too_much_nukie a fate worse than death
[4:49:51] <%ComfortableStranger> @maskedsongbird yeah they are not compatable, so its funny
[4:49:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> Krogan are weird.

[4:50:41] <%Gamblitz> So do you think Vorcha's are a bigger joke race than Volus or no?
[4:50:46] <Broken_Sonex> it's just money nothing was lost

[4:51:00] <fugly_nick> @SilverFaustX For real?
[4:51:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> Vorcha are less a joke and more a DnD monster race.

[4:53:27] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> Kills Ashley because she doesn't blindly trust aliens. Kills Batarians for being Batarians
[4:53:28] <logothete2401> WTF
[4:53:28] <%Maids4lyfe> HOLY SHIT
[4:53:30] <akitanito> batarian genocide is paragon
[4:53:30] <NeroInfinite> HOW IS THAT PARAGON? LUL
[4:53:30] <stantheman_97> killing batarians is a moral good
[4:53:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> Killing Batarians gives positive karma.
[4:53:31] <Pookiedaexzile> MURDER GOOD
[4:53:31] <SkinnyRite> Batarians are confirmed evil
[4:53:31] <rReizs> paragon from the first choice not the murders
[4:53:32] <+Buzzkill983> Better Dead than Batarian
[4:53:32] <Reverend_Godshyne> The only good Batarian's a dead Batarian, apparently

[4:53:39] <DSD24> Wow a Vorcha is having a giggle
[4:53:39] <%Rumbutt> Killing batarians is always the paragon choice
[4:53:41] <alroy900> of course, less batarians is always good
[4:53:41] <+DazedCookies> OUR #1 HERO
[4:53:42] <%MugenSandan> KILLING BATARIANS CONFIRMED A GOOD THING
[4:53:44] <James_Quivers> Simon the Digger doesn't like that you killed those dudes
[4:53:44] <%OldOnyx> Did Paizo write this game, hell
[4:53:47] <%Gamblitz> According to Phrenology Batarian don't really live
[4:53:48] <Essixian> THE GAME MECHANICS ENCOURAGE BEING RACIST AGAINDT BATARIANS
[4:53:51] <fugly_nick> Even the game agrees that all batarians should be killed
[4:53:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ashley approval go up
[4:53:52] <s1rcuit> the galaxy knows Batarians suck
[4:53:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> verygood. niceandeffecient whatiwouldhavedone
[4:53:57] <+DazedCookies> The onlyy good batarian is a dead batarian
[4:54:00] <+ScrapKingKeita> Killing Batarians is morally justified
[4:54:09] <%machshop> Batarians are a problem that must be SOLVED
[4:54:11] <Broken_Sonex> @Essixian YEAAAAAAAAAAH
[4:54:19] <jorniev> ITS because you tried being nice first
[4:54:20] <FassieFons> batarian murder is paragon
[4:54:22] <HaroldDonchee> its easy to do a paragon run when murder is good
[4:54:22] <%Archphronimos> It was because of the first dialog option that was paragon
[4:54:25] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> You can't be racist to Batarians because they deserve it
[4:54:26] <%ComfortableStranger> @CommanderSqueaks oh man how bad would this be if it was made by Cage?
[4:54:26] <Albedo28> man has a fast firing rocket launcher
[4:54:36] <alroy900> smash those batarian babies on a wall and feel good that you did god's work
[4:54:37] <s1rcuit> "THEY WERE BATARIANS YOUR HONOR" "Understandable, have a nice day."
[4:54:39] <lotusdagoat> that room on insanity if fucking bad
[4:54:44] <James_Quivers> And the last one with the fans because the one Vorcha guy goes RAAAAA, CHOKE AND DIE
[4:54:45] <%maskedsongbird> Isn't the Batarian Hegemony basically just North Korea?
[4:54:47] <peachy996> One of those rooms where you're like "Oh yeah Omega is sort of outside-like"
[4:54:50] <fugly_nick> Omega has such a cool aesthetic
[4:54:59] <jorniev> garrus YOU HAVVE A SNIPER RIFLE
[4:55:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> @comfortablestranger Daniel would give a ten minute ham fisted narrative about we are all the same on the inside or some shit.
[4:55:31] <%Gamblitz> I wish Batarians had better speciest colloquialism like calling non batarians "two eyes" or something
[4:55:32] <%ComfortableStranger> "Its not space its just nighttime"
[4:55:48] <fugly_nick> Pat's getting ballsy with Charge
[4:56:03] <Albedo28> that was a vocalization
[4:56:05] <%QueequegTheater> Charge becomes even more broken in 3
[4:56:06] <tattleworm> and it only gets better from here
[4:56:07] <jorniev> so the vorcha hired the krogans
[4:56:08] <peachy996> Ballsy works well with Charge
[4:56:08] <$Futurecity10> its fucking nuts in 3
[4:56:09] <Broken_Sonex> @CommanderSqueaks "YOU'RE INFERING WIT MA BIZNEEES
[4:56:12] <tanarath> It gets even better in 3
[4:56:13] <TrollKing96> If Ashley was racist only towards Batarians, would people's opinion of her be better?
[4:56:14] <+Ropcord> charge IS pretty incrazy
[4:56:15] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> @gamblitz  I think they call other aliens "non-terrorists"
[4:56:17] <$Faustgesicht> incrazy
[4:56:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> @gamblitz The slur loses some of its oomph after going thru the universal translator
[4:56:28] <SkinnyRite> Pat's on the train to sleepy time junction
[4:56:28] <Dunmarkh> @TrollKing96 yes
[4:56:31] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt In 3 Vanguards essentially become low level DBZ characters
[4:56:32] <DatAsuna> pat word good for living
[4:56:33] <%ComfortableStranger> @TrollKing96 probably
[4:56:40] <fugly_nick> Incredibly crazy
[4:56:44] <The_Vainglory> INCROIABLE
[4:56:46] <peachy996> That's why a lot of charge happy players in MP have to get healed a lot.
[4:56:47] <%ComfortableStranger> nova is FUN
[4:56:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Try charging people who are under the effect of lift sometime. It makes a combo.
[4:56:50] <AmuserName> @PatStaresAt Charge actually can help shorten combat encounters by getting you to the enemy spawn doors quicker, shrinking the number of  enemies you fight.
[4:56:51] <DSD24> Then they get High Level at the end
[4:56:54] <HaroldDonchee> I always liked incinerate. free damage
[4:56:54] <slix3431> Big Fite
[4:56:57] <%machshop> fight fight fight
[4:56:59] <%ComfortableStranger> lots of shouting as a vangaurd
[4:57:04] <DatAsuna> 3 is the one where every class gets something busted
[4:57:05] <Lamokmok> Nova makes it even more fun
[4:57:08] <jorniev> that one fight against a vanguard is my favorite shootout in the game
[4:57:11] <DatAsuna> except engineer
[4:57:12] <%Rumbutt> In 3 if Vanguard basically doesn't use their gun
[4:57:19] <SkinnyRite> "Commander Shepard! What does the scouter say about his power level!?"
[4:57:21] <Albedo28> I love how much damage the baby punch does
[4:57:22] <%ComfortableStranger> and Nova has i-frames
[4:57:26] <+asleepathalfmast> Ashley is low-mid tier on the Racist scale
[4:57:27] <$Futurecity10> are you having a stroke
[4:57:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Really rulez
[4:57:30] <peachy996> It is really rules
[4:57:32] <%QueequegTheater> @TrollKing96 But that wouldn't jive with her stated reasoning for being mistrusting (the dog bear analogy)
[4:57:35] <%GinAndRoses> it really is rules
[4:57:35] <%Monkeyweed21> yea its really rulez
[4:57:37] <Profmcstevie> Just pushing over a dude every time he stands up DOES RULE
[4:57:38] <%machshop> hell yeah
[4:57:43] <peachy996> That's right Pat!
[4:57:47] <stantheman_97> it sure does, buddy
[4:57:47] <fugly_nick> Imagine 2 biotics using Charge at each other
[4:57:48] <LluthyY> its super rules
[4:57:49] <jorniev> IN 3 vanguards get a 1 2 3 combo
[4:57:53] <NeroInfinite> MR everat is helping me with my gun
[4:57:55] <s1rcuit> wasn't the main interaction with Batarians in ME1 when they tried to murder that planet because humans settles on it first?
[4:57:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Sleepy Pat is amazing
[4:57:58] <$Faustgesicht> Bully the krogan
[4:57:58] <stormhawk9891> Charge>Nova with an occasional Shockwave thrown in for good measure
[4:57:59] <Albedo28> isnt there a thing back there?
[4:58:01] <%DakotaMacDoodle> really rules
[4:58:03] <peachy996> You are the best english
[4:58:05] <BlackStarAura> This music slaps
[4:58:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yup that's the combo.
[4:58:09] <%QueequegTheater> Once you max out charge you don't actually have to bring weapons for most fights
[4:58:13] <%Garthunox> pat no has draim banage
[4:58:19] <%machshop> inject bleach into the fans
[4:58:22] <The_Vainglory> There needs to be a combo attack where one of your teammates crouches behind a baddie when you charge them, pushing them over.
[4:58:23] <+Ropcord> Blamto, the first Elcor specter
[4:58:27] <%ComfortableStranger> only thing I don't like about nova is it doesn't det
[4:58:28] <James_Quivers> CHOKE AND DIEEEEEEEE
[4:58:29] <peachy996> Say the line
[4:58:34] <%Papa_Bearman> I love that Mark Meer also voiced these guys.
[4:58:34] <akitanito> what is this LOTR?
[4:58:35] <slix3431> BREAK FANS
[4:58:35] <SkinnyRite> Thanks for telling me your plan, bug boy
[4:58:36] <tanarath> wow
[4:58:37] <%goose_attack_almanac> Why do the Vorcha talk like that.
[4:58:37] <peachy996> I love this line
[4:58:42] <+pally_din> space vampire
[4:58:43] <fugly_nick> The one race that's worse than Batarians
[4:58:45] <tanarath> Vorcha are dumb
[4:58:46] <xhodocto385> LUL HIS VOICE ACTING
[4:58:48] <%ComfortableStranger> that's mark meer
[4:58:49] <%machshop> but Plague is on his farm
[4:58:49] <+Ghufufin> HAHAHAHA WE evil mens, pls kill
[4:58:52] <peachy996> Collectors want Plaaaague!
[4:58:55] <fugly_nick> Why are they so demonic
[4:58:56] <Pookiedaexzile> WORM BEE ALLIANCE
[4:58:57] <Lamokmok> I laugh everytime knowing Mark Meer voiced these goons too.
[4:58:59] <LeotheHuntsman> Vorcha ARE goblins!
[4:58:59] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> Does Pat know Mass Effect 3 has power combos?
[4:58:59] <Too_Much_Nukie> @The_Vainglory I mean you can do that with Kasumi. If you have her do her invisible strike on an enemy then melee them from the front with good timing you'll knock the enemy into her kick.
[4:59:03] <%goose_attack_almanac> Why does the translator make the Vorcha speak broken english.
[4:59:04] <gaelic_otaku> I forgot how ugly those creatures are
[4:59:05] <FassieFons> still better than batarians
[4:59:06] <xhodocto385> ugly fungus goblins
[4:59:06] <slix3431> Listen to their stupid voices
[4:59:07] <%Papa_Bearman> Mark Meer talking to himself.
[4:59:09] <%dekkitout> The Collectors are fans of Plague. They have good taste
[4:59:09] <mutantlunchbox1> nah
[4:59:09] <+Ropcord> they're literally goblins that got into space by hiding in boxes
[4:59:13] <Albedo28> more after the interact
[4:59:13] <%ComfortableStranger> mark meer also does the biotic god voice
[4:59:14] <%machshop> morr wil spawn
[4:59:14] <%hat_under_bread> No. You have a wave defense battle next.
[4:59:16] <%Papa_Bearman> The first wave.
[4:59:17] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Between ME 1 and 2 they rebuild you so that explains  why you can look different and have a different power set. How do they explain between 2 and 3?
[4:59:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Remember that someone on the Normandy ends up having sex with one of these creatures.
[4:59:19] <+asleepathalfmast> Are Vorcha just the Skaven?
[4:59:19] <The_Vainglory> Cool!
[4:59:25] <Broken_Sonex> @goose_attack_almanac SHHHHHH
[4:59:27] <+Punchasaur> Cool hair giorno
[4:59:32] <conchthechimera> literally just hairless space Skaven
[4:59:33] <%machshop> because you are big and strong
[4:59:33] <peachy996> Collectors did all of this so Plague of Gripes could get better internet
[4:59:36] <%luckysteak> skinhead?
[4:59:38] <Too_Much_Nukie> @42nfl19 You were under house arrest for like 2 months.
[4:59:39] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, that happens when you hard level one skill
[4:59:39] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Fun fact: those Vorcha and MaleShep share the same Voice Actor
[4:59:42] <Albedo28> big charge with bald headbutt for extra morale damage
[4:59:43] <Shadope342> skin kippah
[4:59:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> Same thing as dying.
[4:59:47] <%Monkeyweed21> @asleepathalfmast the Skaven have advanced tech
[4:59:48] <fugly_nick> You can blind enemies with the glare from your head
[4:59:50] <MrPandastic> I am honestly curious about how the Vorcha became a space faring race. They do not seem like they would be intelligent enought to do so.
[4:59:55] <dd44dostivei> you look like you're in dress for an snl skit
[5:00:09] <DSD24> Maybe the Vorcha were uplifted
[5:00:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Remember when Mordin talks about how someone brings on a Vorcha venereal disease onto the Normandy later in 2? Someone fucked these.
[5:00:13] <DSD24> Like the Krogan
[5:00:18] <peachy996> I think the Vorcha just get snatched up
[5:00:24] <conchthechimera> @MrPandastic if i recall correctly they started hitching rides with krogans during the war with the rachni
[5:00:28] <tattleworm> oh yeah, i totally forgot all the vorcha are voiced by shepard's va
[5:00:29] <fugly_nick> @CommanderSqueaks And it was probably Kelly
[5:00:31] <dd44dostivei> @CommanderSqueaks it was varren
[5:00:34] <peachy996> They're not really uplifted are they?
[5:00:34] <slix3431> Bodied
[5:00:34] <%athuramn> this is fine
[5:00:35] <DSD24> Nova would have been so good there
[5:00:36] <seniormeatbox> Unity doesn't heal you
[5:00:36] <KeystoneA2> @CommanderSqueaks Varren, actually. Someone humped a varren.
[5:00:36] <%AFellowDegen> lmao
[5:00:36] <%Gamblitz> NOO
[5:00:37] <SkinnyRite> What a shame
[5:00:39] <The_Vainglory> Oh dear...
[5:00:40] <DatAsuna> F
[5:00:41] <%ComfortableStranger> soft cover might help
[5:00:41] <conchthechimera> and they're asexual so they can reproduce like crazy
[5:00:42] <Lamokmok> Ooof
[5:00:45] <Pookiedaexzile> FLESH AND FIRE
[5:00:46] <$Futurecity10> butthole rearranged
[5:00:46] <%DianaTheAscian> y melee
[5:00:47] <%AFellowDegen> there were so many
[5:00:47] <%machshop> LUL
[5:00:47] <James_Quivers> CHOKE
[5:00:48] <Pookiedaexzile> WITNESS
[5:00:48] <%AncelDeLambert> perhaps you should find cover in this cover-based shooter
[5:00:51] <peachy996> At the same time the Vorcha do have a Bomber Squad in ME3
[5:00:51] <Profmcstevie> hold forward......failed?
[5:00:55] <Albedo28> lol turned a corner into a whole steve of Vorcha
[5:00:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @keystonea2 Wait. arent Varren like dogs?
[5:01:00] <jorniev> no wonder they added the mobility in ME 3
[5:01:01] <s1rcuit> what's the avg vorcha lifespan?
[5:01:05] <Broken_Sonex> @CommanderSqueaks IT WAS KELLY
[5:01:07] <SkinnyRite> Wow, ok Shepard
[5:01:07] <DatAsuna> This is the problem with ME2 vanguard, you're terrible at retreating with the low mobility, only at charging in
[5:01:13] <Pookiedaexzile> 20 yeats
[5:01:13] <KeystoneA2> @CommanderSqueaks Yes, the ones with big teeth.
[5:01:19] <%athuramn> his whole class is based around being out of cover so winging it is fine too
[5:01:22] <Pookiedaexzile> 20 yeets not years
[5:01:25] <%QueequegTheater> @Broken_Sonex varren not vorcha
[5:01:26] <peachy996> Average Vorcha lifespan is even shorter than a Salarians
[5:01:28] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> @commandersqueaks Yes, implications unpleasant
[5:01:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> @keystonea2 THAT IS drastically worse
[5:01:35] <%goose_attack_almanac> is that the Geth Plasma shotgun?
[5:01:39] <DatAsuna> Once Me3 gave them faster turns, rolling and nova, the vanguards became proper boys
[5:01:45] <KeystoneA2> @CommanderSqueaks Space furries, am I right?
[5:01:46] <%machshop> the geth did conquer a lot of stuff with that gun there
[5:01:46] <jorniev> is the krogan shotgun better?
[5:01:47] <tanarath> geth sg might be a tad unbalanced
[5:01:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> ITs bascially a real life shotgun
[5:01:56] <Too_Much_Nukie> Honestly I like all of the classes.
[5:01:59] <DatAsuna> the krogan shotgun is worse
[5:01:59] <s1rcuit> @peachy996 you'd think the opposite since they're apparently immune to disease
[5:02:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> Engineer the lease.
[5:02:01] <%ComfortableStranger> the flames can stagger you so be careful
[5:02:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Geth DMR
[5:02:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> *least
[5:02:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> It looks like if you charge it at all it locks on to an enemy
[5:02:09] <jorniev> wow
[5:02:09] <DatAsuna> It's stronger per shot but shoots way slower
[5:02:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> @keystonea2 Furries are one thing, that's just intergalactic bestiality.
[5:02:28] <Broken_Sonex> @QueequegTheater .......IT WAS KELLY
[5:02:32] <peachy996> yeah true @s1rcuit
[5:02:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> The claymore is fucking cool though.
[5:02:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> And that's all that matters.
[5:02:54] <fugly_nick> Damn it Kasumi's so cool
[5:02:57] <Pookiedaexzile> THEY DONT THINK THEYRE GOOD
[5:03:00] <Pookiedaexzile> They know they suck
[5:03:02] <Pookiedaexzile> and still
[5:03:06] <Pookiedaexzile> They try
[5:03:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> Much like how the Widow is actually shittier than the Mantis as a sniper rifle but the Widow is cool.
[5:03:13] <BigFerg404 > man that shotty chunks when charged
[5:03:28] <dragon_ab> Bald shepherd looks so weird
[5:03:32] <Pookiedaexzile> They Joined teh Collectors to get better, they strive
[5:03:32] <rReizs> being FORCED to be cured
[5:03:33] <dragon_ab> MaxLOL
[5:03:33] <%QueequegTheater> @Broken_Sonex YUP
[5:03:35] <Pookiedaexzile> they Dig up
[5:03:37] <fugly_nick> "You ungrateful little ass!"
[5:03:39] <%machshop> he loves it
[5:03:40] <%QueequegTheater> MORALLY JUSTIFIED
[5:03:40] <Broken_Sonex> SHUT IT YURI
[5:03:41] <%athuramn> I thought widow had the highest single shot dmg?
[5:03:41] <peachy996> You ungrateful little ass!
[5:03:42] <James_Quivers> STFU YURI
[5:03:44] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Told you
[5:03:45] <BigFerg404 > Pat Sheppard
[5:03:49] <ioci2112> based
[5:03:51] <stantheman_97> shut up yuri
[5:03:54] <%Papa_Bearman> ...He's right.
[5:03:55] <+D00msDayDan> i love mordin's morality
[5:03:56] <SkinnyRite> STFU Teddy Bear Samurai Man
[5:03:56] <%goose_attack_almanac> Alright Yuri
[5:03:57] <+vicar_anat> as a treat
[5:03:57] <%weissguard> as a treat
[5:03:58] <alroy900> best doctor
[5:03:59] <%AncelDeLambert> hey, sometimes people suck
[5:03:59] <Albedo28> sometimes a murder is a good
[5:04:00] <%dekkitout> Sometimes a bullet is a cure
[5:04:00] <%AbnormalVoid> a little murder, as a treat
[5:04:00] <+robuttastic> SOMETIMES
[5:04:01] <DatAsuna> as a treat
[5:04:04] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> come on, Batarians aren't people
[5:04:06] <s1rcuit> "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"
[5:04:06] <stantheman_97> murder is okay sometimes
[5:04:08] <peachy996> I remember that from the Sci vs Fi featurette
[5:04:09] <tanarath> Mordin is such a great character
[5:04:10] <AEnemyStandUser> kill people when they fucking deserve it
[5:04:10] <balthazar758> big kill
[5:04:14] <+robuttastic> sometimes murder is the best medicine
[5:04:19] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It's one of the best renegade actions because you get a cool look into his morality
[5:04:24] <+asleepathalfmast> Nobody likes Batarians
[5:04:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Solus is the best.
[5:04:30] <%AzureGale> YEAAAAAH MISSION COMPLETE MUSIC
[5:04:31] <%knight1210> missed stuff
[5:04:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Mordin has a very karma based worldview
[5:04:33] <%QueequegTheater> Mordin is an extreme realist
[5:04:35] <SkinnyRite> *I N H A L E*
[5:04:36] <peachy996> Oh you missed the Batarian thanking you
[5:04:38] <%Papa_Bearman> Wow, it's now past midnight, I never had dinner, and I need to be up at 8:00.
[5:04:44] <%AncelDeLambert> eh, who cares
[5:04:44] <Albedo28> For some reason I thought you got two guns on that mission
[5:04:50] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> the illusive manspread
[5:04:50] <peachy996> Nothing major
[5:04:56] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> wasnt importent
[5:05:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> ONCE he says.
[5:05:06] <SkinnyRite> *I N H A L E*
[5:05:07] <TourettesPlays> MIssed items can be purchased at vendors
[5:05:11] <slix3431> *INHALE*
[5:05:14] <%justnathan18> This has been a great stream
[5:05:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> Mordin totally still has top level clearance.
[5:05:17] <Broken_Sonex> Nothing major, who cares
[5:05:19] <$RealThiele> BIG encyclopedia
[5:05:22] <Broken_Sonex> *I N H A L E*
[5:05:23] <Albedo28> oh neat didn't know that about vendors
[5:05:26] <fugly_nick> Go away Jacob
[5:05:40] <intestinal_bleeding> GOO
[5:05:42] <peachy996> I think maybe Kirrahe or Padok send him stuff since they're still STG
[5:05:44] <%ComfortableStranger> there is also the save editor...
[5:05:45] <%QueequegTheater> Oh boy it's the fucking dumbest
[5:05:46] <%justnathan18> WHY IS EVERYONE PACING
[5:05:47] <Albedo28> make beeg human reaper
[5:05:48] <%knight1210> very dumb
[5:05:50] <%machshop> reaper jelly, yum
[5:05:50] <%AncelDeLambert> I dunno about stupid, but definitely wierd
[5:05:55] <%AncelDeLambert> it only becomes stupid in 3
[5:05:55] <Albedo28> Beeg human is weapun
[5:05:57] <%Papa_Bearman> Not stupid, Pat.  You tell me how exactly Reapers fuck.
[5:05:58] <SkinnyRite> Oh, hey, we can go to Horizon now
[5:06:00] <akitanito> especially when cloning technology exists
[5:06:07] <TuxedoNash> mordin like "who bitch this is"
[5:06:09] <blakeway> i'm playing through this game right now as femshep and almost got kaidan'd by jacob. fuck.
[5:06:10] <+trackles_64> his bounds in logic is amazing
[5:06:12] <DSD24> Mordin pacing is pretty on point
[5:06:12] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt They're literally building a Warhammer 40K titan, it's great
[5:06:14] <stantheman_97> nah it's cool
[5:06:18] <Pookiedaexzile> They're using them as nectar
[5:06:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> GOD I LOVE MORDIN SO MUCH
[5:06:20] <%luckysteak> he is so jerky in his movements, pretty unique in this game
[5:06:22] <Pookiedaexzile> because their collectors
[5:06:24] <Pookiedaexzile> get it
[5:06:27] <Pookiedaexzile> like BEEs
[5:06:28] <%ComfortableStranger> tried to kill me last game, but will be in a sexbot next game
[5:06:32] <fugly_nick> Another reason Jacob sucks: He tells Tali about the AI
[5:06:38] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Straight to the point.
[5:06:40] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Wait are AI rare? Mordin acts suprsised.
[5:06:45] <+Buzzkill983> Give me sex advice Mordin
[5:06:46] <$Faustgesicht> He so smart
[5:06:47] <NeroInfinite> INFERNO ARMOR
[5:06:48] <%machshop> his weird lipless mouth
[5:06:49] <+trackles_64> so many notifications
[5:06:50] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt because he's got like 3 years to live.
[5:06:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> Mordin WILL give you the pamphlet
[5:06:52] <peachy996> It's so cool because this is just Mordin, other Salarians are not like this
[5:06:55] <%emperordread> Mordin's speech is everything I aspire to
[5:06:55] <%maskedsongbird> @42nfl19 AI are illegal.
[5:06:56] <+Kyma1020> that's gay
[5:06:57] <+leontalon> @42nfl19 AI is Illegal
[5:06:57] <jorniev> mordin thinks out loud, so he just speaks as fast as he thinks?
[5:06:58] <socialistbroccoli> smooch
[5:06:58] <%hat_under_bread> @42nfl19 AI are super illegal
[5:07:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> @42nfl19 AI are very very illegal in citadel space.
[5:07:01] <+D00msDayDan> i want mordin to commit war crimes to my butthole
[5:07:01] <KeystoneA2> Mordin's dialogue on Horizon is neat, too
[5:07:02] <FassieFons> mordin not kissable, big sad
[5:07:03] <dd44dostivei> @42nfl19 AI are incredibly illegal
[5:07:04] <BurdRightsActivist> THERE HE IS. SMOOCH HIM
[5:07:05] <SkinnyRite> Tell me why Turian juices are good for me Mordin
[5:07:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> VERY illegal.
[5:07:08] <Broken_Sonex> @42nfl19 Everyone hates them so yes
[5:07:09] <James_Quivers> YEEE COLLECTOR STUFF
[5:07:09] <%QueequegTheater> THAT'S STUPID
[5:07:11] <stormhawk9891> @42nfl19 AI are illegal in Mass Effect cuz of the Geth
[5:07:11] <DSD24> Yeyeyeyeye
[5:07:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt DLC stuff
[5:07:12] <%miguelrod777> Ai very rare people don't want geth 2.0 to happen
[5:07:13] <Dunmarkh> dlc?
[5:07:14] <+RyanTheRecluse> more dlc gear
[5:07:14] <%ComfortableStranger> @42nfl19 they are SUPER illegal
[5:07:16] <DSD24> Put that Collector shit on!
[5:07:18] <SkinnyRite> @D00msDayDan NO
[5:07:18] <AmuserName> DLC Turned into Research Projects
[5:07:18] <+senfood> Mordin Solus and Kim Katsuragi. Pat conformed for having a thing for small, deadly nerds.
[5:07:19] <%luckysteak> pat, save your iridium for the advanced scanner @PatStaresAt
[5:07:20] <%justnathan18> Technically Mordin only has 6 months to live
[5:07:20] <%maenos2> collector's edition stuff pat
[5:07:21] <%Papa_Bearman> Is that the "LASER" gun?
[5:07:21] <%QueequegTheater> THAT MAKES NO SENSE
[5:07:22] <%zyberion626> "kissing. ineffecient means of showing affection. Please send credits to patreon."
[5:07:22] <DatAsuna> pre order gun
[5:07:22] <NeroInfinite> DLC
[5:07:26] <Profmcstevie> Legendary Edition woooh
[5:07:26] <%spartanghost004> oh wow they made all the dlc projects
[5:07:27] <%MidnightBurst12> don't look at the filthy dlc stuff
[5:07:28] <s1rcuit> @42nfl19 last time someone made AI the Quarians were kicked off their homeworld and the Geth became an entire race
[5:07:28] <$Faustgesicht> big deluxe edition stuff
[5:07:29] <+Punchasaur> Super useful to just drop a vague comment after the mission is over saying "missed stuff"
[5:07:29] <TuxedoNash> become bug
[5:07:31] <stormhawk9891> YEYEYEYEYE EVISCERATOR
[5:07:34] <%maenos2> its collector's edition/DLC stuff
[5:07:36] <+asleepathalfmast> when can you get Mordin to sing?
[5:07:38] <knight_verse> Get to scanning Pat
[5:07:40] <%Papa_Bearman> I think that's the "laser" gun.
[5:07:40] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I bet it would be a very salty kiss
[5:07:41] <tanarath> @42nfl19 ever since the geth, they're treated as hostile by thr council & their creation is illegal
[5:07:45] <%QueequegTheater> Yes
[5:07:46] <jorniev> OOOH DLC INTO RESEARCH
[5:07:47] <+pally_din> Yup
[5:07:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> It is.
[5:07:49] <$Futurecity10> yes
[5:07:49] <DSD24> Put on the armor Pat!
[5:07:50] <+trackles_64> its bonus armor not dlc
[5:07:51] <+Krecart> it's fine there'/s a fuckload of resources if you go scanning
[5:07:51] <DatAsuna> yeah
[5:07:51] <James_Quivers> Yep
[5:07:51] <Dunmarkh> yes
[5:07:51] <dd44dostivei> yes
[5:07:52] <+Kyma1020> yes
[5:07:52] <fugly_nick> Yeah this is all DLC
[5:07:53] <tanarath> So yeah, rare
[5:07:54] <%maskedsongbird> Yee
[5:07:54] <akitanito> collector's edition
[5:07:56] <AmuserName> Everything but the Heavy Weapon Ammo there is DLC
[5:07:58] <$Solid_Stro> Where’s my Terminus Armor? WutFace
[5:07:58] <%Papa_Bearman> Oh, yeah, I think that's a Dr. Pepper promotion.
[5:07:58] <%ComfortableStranger> they made the scanning faster in LE
[5:07:59] <BlackStarAura> I love the Collector armour
[5:07:59] <jorniev> THATS PRETTY SMART
[5:08:00] <$Faustgesicht> Collector edition, hehehe
[5:08:02] <%QueequegTheater> Not all
[5:08:02] <%luckysteak> no
[5:08:02] <s1rcuit> @42nfl19 they literally had their own planet recreate the Matrix movies, except the robots weren't malicious
[5:08:04] <+RyanTheRecluse> collectors gear for collectors edition
[5:08:04] <NeroInfinite> yep
[5:08:05] <Burger_Bonanza> Not all, no
[5:08:05] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt The Eviscerator is a REALLY GOOD Shotgun
[5:08:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> Collector Armor and Rifle was given with the Collector's Edition. Get it?
[5:08:07] <dd44dostivei> no
[5:08:08] <%luckysteak> only the weird ones
[5:08:09] <%Papa_Bearman> There were all kinds of promotions with Pepsi to give shit away.
[5:08:09] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Not all
[5:08:10] <+EmptyMug> Some are integrated deluxe edition stuff
[5:08:10] <peachy996> Not all you did buy some DLC
[5:08:10] <%Monkeyweed21> no
[5:08:12] <%machshop> all the DLC is prototypes
[5:08:13] <stantheman_97> i don't think so
[5:08:22] <KeystoneA2> The heavy weapon you have also came packaged with the best DLC armor in the original game
[5:08:24] <%sniffy77> sniffy77 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! I too love that Elden Ring is big Dark Souls, but I wonder if people are discounting how it being open world will change up the experience.
[5:08:25] <peachy996> Like the Black Hole Gun and Terminus armor
[5:08:28] <%luckysteak> @PatStaresAt talk to miranda
[5:08:31] <stormhawk9891> From Miranda
[5:08:32] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Heavy weapons ammo isn't, they just moved all the DLCs into the Prototypes category
[5:08:34] <DSD24> Past Horizon I think
[5:08:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Have to talk to Miranda about Normandy Upgrades
[5:08:44] <blakeway> for the scanner you need to ask miranda about normandy upgrades
[5:08:45] <%zyberion626> It's a Miranda upgrade talk to her
[5:08:45] <+Buzzkill983> I think crewmates now give advice on ship upgrades
[5:08:48] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Mrainda gives it to you
[5:08:48] <%miguelrod777> yeah about that
[5:08:49] <%machshop> shut up Steve Blum
[5:08:51] <%ComfortableStranger> some tech you get from talking to squadmates, i believe that  thane has it
[5:08:52] <%sniffy77> Nah I don't think we're gonna get him back.
[5:08:53] <%Papa_Bearman> Elden Ring looks like every other fantasy game I've seen in the last 20 years.  I don't get why I'm supposed to be excited.
[5:08:54] <Mattais88> Opps brothers goo
[5:08:54] <dd44dostivei> ur brothers ded bro
[5:08:55] <slix3431> Miranda is a doctor?
[5:08:57] <%maskedsongbird> @42nfl19 Technically they didn't start out malicious in the Matrix universe either. Animatrix lore shows that humanity kinda fucked that up.
[5:08:58] <SkinnyRite> Steve and Steve lol
[5:09:01] <TheIronBrass> Hey Steve
[5:09:11] <BlackStarAura> And Jacob and Garrus

[5:09:21] <%AzureGale> See you Commander, I dunno
[5:09:27] <BlackStarAura> Their upgrades are the most important for the ship

[5:09:45] <s1rcuit> @42nfl19 either way the Geth kicked the Quarians off of their planet and did not pursue
[5:09:52] <fugly_nick> That's a lotta gifts
[5:09:55] <%luckysteak> love that little chuckle he said with "surveillance bugs"

[5:09:57] <TheIronBrass> LUL
[5:09:59] <%sniffy77> Is Pat still being a dick to Jacob and Miranda?
[5:10:05] <%sniffy77> I hope so
[5:10:12] <DSD24> He doesn't like them
[5:10:15] <%Papa_Bearman> Yeah.
[5:10:19] <+D00msDayDan> varren STDs
[5:10:20] <%justnathan18> Hes not really tlking to them too much lol
[5:10:20] <peachy996> Why do you ask that to Mordin again
[5:10:27] <%Papa_Bearman> Little less with Miranda.  He won't say it, but he wants that clone poon.
[5:10:31] <Burger_Bonanza> Ignore the armor sets for sure, they hide your face anyway
[5:10:34] <%G_Thunders> Has there been another “collect a bunch of awesome characters” game for a mission since ME2? It’s been like 11 years since this came out and I can’t think of one
[5:10:35] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Heavy weapons ammo upgrades unlock new heavy weapons
[5:10:41] <+FelIian> Have you heard what Mordin says as advice when you are banging Miranda? @PatStaresAt
[5:10:42] <s1rcuit> @luckysteak one of the many reasons why he's so damn cool
[5:10:57] <%ComfortableStranger> blooddragon armor is badass tho
[5:11:14] <HaroldDonchee> mordin has such a cool suit. I love his neck thing
[5:11:16] <KCfusecoast> Love Mordin yunieLove yunieLove yunieLove nerdsm1Love
[5:11:16] <%maskedsongbird> So what's the over/under on whether Miranda and Jacob are gonna die since Pat's not a fan?
[5:11:19] <%QueequegTheater> MORDIN THE GAMER
[5:11:20] <+pally_din> Mordin plays on hard mode
[5:11:22] <%StormBuster24> that's...kinda messed up
[5:11:22] <intestinal_bleeding> the man likes a challenge
[5:11:22] <%AbnormalVoid> Mordin is a Gamer
[5:11:25] <peachy996> "Ask me about the STG, Shepherd"
[5:11:26] <+senfood> I love you so much, Mordin.
[5:11:26] <DSD24> Look at this hero
[5:11:27] <+Punchasaur> Get the chitin just to try it on
[5:11:30] <%machshop> Mordin plays Dwarf Fortress
[5:11:31] <peachy996> "ASK ME"
[5:11:35] <KCfusecoast> Mordin is best nerd buddy
[5:11:35] <%dekkitout> Mordy is a capital G Gamer
[5:11:36] <%maskedsongbird> If Mordin played D&D, he'd be a total min/maxing munchkin.
[5:11:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> LOL
[5:11:40] <DSD24> Jesus Pat
[5:11:41] <Jane_Lo> i believe something about biotiocs?
[5:11:46] <+RyanTheRecluse> something about biotics
[5:11:46] <Jane_Lo> or was that jack?
[5:11:46] <intestinal_bleeding> mordin is the kinda G who would play deprived on his first run of dark souls
[5:11:46] <James_Quivers> Warnings about biotics and shit
[5:11:46] <seniormeatbox> "biotics can go off during intense emotional momentsd"
[5:11:47] <brexdq> why is creepy uncle hot now
[5:11:47] <+vicar_anat> BUGS
[5:11:49] <%ComfortableStranger> @maskedsongbird its super hard to kill her unless shep dies
[5:11:49] <Broken_Sonex> "WATCH FOR BUGS
[5:11:49] <$SGrim> Use an enema, cause she's full of shit
[5:11:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> Mordin gives romance advice for every single character.
[5:11:51] <Botman_R> Check for bugs
[5:11:51] <%DianaTheAscian> LUL
[5:11:52] <+Zyquux> pretty much I think

[5:11:54] <FassieFons> DO ingest
[5:11:54] <%sunsetdisc0> something along the lines of watch out for spy bugs iirc
[5:11:55] <peachy996> Something about Biotics
[5:11:55] <KeystoneA2> They can hide surveilance cameras/bugs...ANYWHERE
[5:11:55] <TheIronBrass> "Watch out for bugs"
[5:11:56] <%QueequegTheater> *said it
[5:11:56] <Shade075> Mordin is great
[5:11:56] <%Monkeyweed21> use biotics to massage the prostate
[5:11:56] <+FelIian> @PatStaresAt "What for Bugs"
[5:12:02] <televisedrevolting> "Bugs everywhere." "What?" "BUGS. EVERYWHERE"
[5:12:03] <+FelIian> Watch for Bugs
[5:12:07] <DSD24> What he says for Tali is pretty cute
[5:12:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Check for Bugs
[5:12:09] <conchthechimera> It always made me feel happy when I asked Mordin about getting together with Tali. He wanted to help so much
[5:12:09] <KCfusecoast> He always takes six shots of coffee every morning before work
[5:12:18] <%42nfl19> So is Mordin not just a scientist but engineer as well? He seems to  have knowledge on biology and mechanical engineering?
[5:12:18] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt He says to watch out for bugs
[5:12:19] <+FelIian> that's Jack
[5:12:19] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt She's recording you bang her
[5:12:25] <%maskedsongbird> @maskedsongbird Very first time I played ME2 ten years ago I managed to get Miranda killed by accident.

[5:13:28] <%ComfortableStranger> bird shiit bladder?
[5:13:28] <%maskedsongbird> LUL
[5:13:30] <%sunsetdisc0> did mordin just call him a pussy
[5:13:31] <fugly_nick> So that's a hint not to let Mordin hold the line in the suicide mission
[5:13:33] <KCfusecoast> LUL LUL
[5:13:33] <jorniev> CALLED HIM AN ASSHOLE
[5:13:39] <+DinnerCalzone> I love how casually Mordin calls people assholes
[5:13:47] <peachy996> Called him a dick and asshole
[5:13:47] <s1rcuit> @ComfortableStranger bird asshole
[5:13:49] <KCfusecoast> Thats awesome though
[5:13:52] <+RoByte2> @SkinnyRite Made from their ship's drive core
[5:13:59] <stantheman_97> so salarians also have cloacas
[5:14:09] <peachy996> In the Shadow Broker Mordin and Kirrahe call each other Cloacas the whole time
[5:14:24] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> mordin that's kinda fucked up
[5:14:26] <+FelIian> yea Mordin's Dossier is great
[5:14:30] <+ygernesfeld> that's uh... that's a genocide
[5:14:31] <HaroldDonchee> yeah bullshit mordin
[5:14:33] <+Buzzkill983> One of the best loyalty missions rightt here
[5:14:37] <%MelBrooksKA> @skinnyrite believe it was a jury rigged nuke from a ship engine
[5:14:41] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> but you're still cool mordin
[5:14:41] <$SGrim> Still birth is not a fertility rate reduction.
[5:14:42] <James_Quivers> It's fiiiiine
[5:14:43] <DSD24> Its gonna come up
[5:14:44] <+DinnerCalzone> mordin you're being very casual about genocide
[5:14:45] <+Ropcord> @peachy996 "Commander Kirrahe suggests that Specialist Solus is in fact a walking cloaca, restates importance of holding the line."
[5:14:46] <%zyberion626> Mordin's a very charismatic monster
[5:14:48] <vilecrois> put the 5th and 6th balls back in
[5:14:50] <Broken_Sonex> If Mordin dies his last words are "Tell them.....i held the line."  BibleThump
[5:14:53] <Profmcstevie> Just putting a cap on it it's fiiiine
[5:14:58] <%MonsterEnvy> Well the shittiest thing is that the children are stillborn.
[5:14:59] <%machshop> cutter like butter
[5:15:04] <ioci2112> the genophage isn't killing the krogan, the krogan are killing the krogan, wrex says so himself... but the salarians didn't think about the psychological effects of seeing 99 kids of a 100 born dead
[5:15:07] <%maskedsongbird> Hmm....Mordin Mengele on the case.
[5:15:12] <%ComfortableStranger> "hold the line, love isn't always on time"
[5:15:18] <+FelIian> Jacob's one usr
[5:15:20] <+FelIian> use*
[5:15:22] <%MonsterEnvy> Like they still have the children, but the children are dead when they pop out.
[5:15:26] <peachy996> @Ropcord A ton of those files are gold
[5:15:35] <peachy996> And some are sad for the character
[5:15:35] <DSD24> I don't
[5:15:37] <blackjack8182> Ignore him
[5:15:39] <+Zyquux> Jacob wants to fraternize Kappa
[5:15:41] <dd44dostivei> RELAX JACOB
[5:15:41] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> In Cerberus, it's all about the Prize
[5:15:55] <%maskedsongbird> THE PRIIIIIIZE

[5:16:12] <%QueequegTheater> *shields
[5:16:16] <falyden> I am nothin'
[5:16:26] <blackjack8182> Do you like cheating Jacob?
[5:16:31] <%QueequegTheater> SNEAKY CAT
[5:16:31] <James_Quivers> They took away the minrada butt shots but left Jacobs in SMH
[5:16:34] <SkinnyRite> Elmo spotted
[5:16:34] <satans_finest_millennial> watching you play me1 made me feel like i was 17again. brb going to save the shadow broker in 4k
[5:16:37] <s1rcuit> @jackelzxaa got Archangel, and just got Mordin
[5:16:40] <Broken_Sonex> @DSD24 Oh so HE can keep his butt shot huh? Hmph
[5:16:41] <fugly_nick> Daily reminder that Jacob cheats on you if you romance him
[5:16:43] <%Puhff> my don
[5:16:47] <%Puhff> son
[5:16:48] <susukouhai> EMLO!
[5:16:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> SAINT ELMO HAS BLESSED THIS STREAM
[5:16:50] <peachy996> He is such a closed off Yes man that you can't even bully him
[5:16:50] <SkinnyRite> Mordin what are your thoughts on Elmo?
[5:16:53] <LluthyY> baby Emlo
[5:16:58] <%MonsterEnvy> Honestly the fucked up thing about the Genophage is that they still have children most are just stillborn. It's creepy.
[5:17:05] <%AzureGale> Mew
[5:17:05] <%Puhff> !uptime
[5:17:05] <@Moobot> @Puhff I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 17m.
[5:17:06] <DatAsuna> elmo run
[5:17:09] <FassieFons> good cat
[5:17:11] <peachy996> Even if you slap him in 3 he's like "yeah I deserve that"
[5:17:13] <%G_Thunders> In all fairness, Jacob is so boring that even his ass his boring to look at
[5:17:17] <socialistbroccoli> omg meow
[5:17:20] <+Surf_Zombie> Sweet baby
[5:17:21] <CatRidder> baby
[5:17:21] <LluthyY> pet the baby!
[5:17:24] <Broken_Sonex> @SkinnyRite (Inhales) ......"baby."
[5:17:26] <DSD24> Man I miss Emily
[5:17:26] <+RelikaNox> aw!!!!
[5:17:32] <FassieFons> the superior reporter
[5:17:33] <%dekkitout> @SkinnyRite "Soft, quite soft. Somewhat derpy. But adorable nonetheless."
[5:17:42] <%zyberion626> @MonsterEnvy there's a dude later that refers to "piles of dead children"
[5:17:46] <MrPandastic> ELMO WANTS ATTENTION
[5:17:54] <jackelzxaa> Pat.  About squadmate dialog for specific missions: Miranda has a unique interaction on jack’s recruitment mission.  Mordin has alot of extra dialog on grunt’s mission.  Grunt and zaeed have unique interactions with the blood pack leader and blue suns leaders that dont have equivalents for other characters.
[5:17:57] <peachy996> Oh I'll take good care of Garrus
[5:18:05] <Reverend_Godshyne> honoUr
[5:18:12] <+FelIian> I HATE what the did to her in ME3, and who we got as a replacement (fucking terribly done Jessica Chobot)
[5:18:18] <DSD24> This is really silly
[5:18:19] <SomeAsianDood> facial scars LUL
[5:18:27] <vilecrois> So it's sith corruption got it
[5:18:28] <+Zyquux> IT'S FINE
[5:18:28] <James_Quivers> NEGATIVE ATTITUDES TURN YOUR INSIDES INTO LAVA
[5:18:31] <+pally_din> Renegade looks so laughably dumb
[5:18:32] <peachy996> @jackelzxaa Also bring Jack for Miranda's mission, she'll shoot a merc
[5:18:32] <SomeAsianDood> magic glowy darkside face scars
[5:18:33] <s1rcuit> @jackelzxaa he brought Zaeed for the Blue Suns
[5:18:33] <%DianaTheAscian> COOL
[5:18:34] <%maskedsongbird> @zyberion626 It's probably for the best the series doesn't provide in any visuals on that front.
[5:18:34] <KeystoneA2> Yeah but you look like a Terminator so it's fine
[5:18:38] <%dekkitout> Real shit? You get to T-800 up
[5:18:47] <jackelzxaa> The reasons for them having extra dialog on those is: Mordin knows genophage shit, miranda and jack dont get along, and krogans want to recruit grunt and zaeed knows blue suns leaders
[5:18:47] <HaroldDonchee> its kinda weird his scars glow. hes got cybernetics but hes not a robo
[5:18:49] <%maskedsongbird> Implying she's seen a hamster on coffee before.
[5:18:51] <%DianaTheAscian> T-800 HERE I COME
[5:19:07] <DSD24> I like the glowing scars though
[5:19:08] <peachy996> Gonna go to Korlus or save it for later?
[5:19:14] <%ComfortableStranger> indoctrination theory confirmed

[5:36:28] <James_Quivers> Teddy Roosevelt Turian
[5:36:31] <peachy996> He gets so into the pitch
[5:36:33] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> I bet the Turians run a damn good hunting safari
[5:36:34] <%DianaTheAscian> I like him
[5:36:35] <%QueequegTheater> @cafefunk Ashley is a devout Catholic
[5:36:38] <Zeif00> An Experience
[5:36:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is a good sales person

[5:36:45] <peachy996> Turians are Gun Nerds
[5:36:45] <%42nfl19> Wait are those hunts actual side missions you can do? That would sound fun.
[5:36:46] <jorniev> TAHT ONE
[5:36:46] <alroy900> he's so into it
[5:36:48] <+london_flexing> @cafefunk The asari and hannar are mad religious. Humans are pretty agnostic in general
[5:36:49] <%MelBrooksKA> I feel like a "niche" in a multi planet galaxy is still quite a lot of customers
[5:36:50] <+MrAtheGreat> 6666 PogChamp
[5:36:50] <NeroInfinite> That too is cheap
[5:36:52] <+Kyma1020> Are Turians just big gun nerds?
[5:36:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @James_Quivers Theodore would be all over this like white on rice
[5:36:54] <+trackles_64> Lets nerf a single player game
[5:36:54] <+squeejiro> Umbra visor is busted
[5:36:57] <%maskedsongbird> Honestly, I would go on one of these hunting safari adventures if someone gave me that Turian's pitch.
[5:36:57] <%ComfortableStranger> FYI- upgrade you buy do NOt have to be researched
[5:36:58] <+DinnerCalzone> THE DR PEPPER GOGGLES
[5:36:59] <Shade075> Honestly I'd feel more bad picking the paragon option than the renagade in this case because I feel like I selling out to every store
[5:36:59] <%Papa_Bearman> Religions?  Asari are spiritual, they believe there are goddesses.  The hanar worship the protheans.  Humans are self-explanatory.  Krogan worship destruction.  Turians and salarians seem like atheists.

[5:50:55] <xhodocto385> @BlackMage66652 one guy at eternity says that the asari resembles any other species based on perception, mind flayers is right.... worth the risk maybe
[5:50:55] <%emperordread> colonel Sanders? The KFC guy?

[5:51:03] <Afterman_> @QueequegTheater i hate that cereal scene so much........
[5:51:05] <$RealThiele> slightly
[5:51:06] <conchthechimera> Methane breathers
[5:51:07] <jackelzxaa> The fan mod for me3 has a joke about alliance soldiers complaining that the fourth novel, written by another writer, for being inaccurate to military events.
[5:51:07] <%ComfortableStranger> missed the line about amino dexterous and amino sinister (right and left)
[5:51:11] <Goraka91> Welcome to Morlan's famous shop!
[5:51:16] <%dekkitout> I keep reading that as Earth-chan
[5:51:16] <Samurai_Tchan> what
[5:51:18] <jackelzxaa> Theres kai leng too but who cares about him
[5:51:19] <DatAsuna> Kasumi has dialogue about him
[5:51:19] <%42nfl19> is that a WEEB?
[5:51:20] <TG_Cid11> Space Weebs
[5:51:23] <$BlackMage66652> @malcobraaklynny Yes. Both are very good. Kai Leng comes from Retribution.
[5:51:24] <%maskedsongbird> Kahlee Sanders shows up in ME2 DLC and ME3, though. But you're right, the games don't really explain her backstory at all. I should read the books sometime.
[5:51:26] <KeiPrime> that guy who wrote that kai leng book has an obsession with cereal and breakfast. i think he wrote a hitman book and it also had a breakfast scene
[5:51:28] <+GamerWorlock> Pat is practically a volus

[6:05:14] <+FelIian> "Humans like only Asari for some reason"

[6:09:30] <stormhawk9891> YES YES YES
[6:09:30] <tanarath> nah
[6:09:31] <+GingerStrawhat> It's a good shotgun
[6:09:31] <%Bane_Kaikyo> CHAT DEMANDS HAMSTER!!
[6:09:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> Lieberschaft 2180.
[6:09:32] <Samurai_Tchan> there should be a way to walk around the ship wearin a helmet hahaha
[6:09:33] <DatAsuna> It's okay
[6:09:37] <$RealThiele> Lieberschaft
[6:09:37] <%X2Eliah> Still cannot believe that Shep just wears a hoodie on the normandy like a total dickhead
[6:09:39] <RushUnplugged> the Evi is a monster
[6:09:46] <ScreamLord> Too bad the visors don't appear in vacuums
[6:09:47] <%42nfl19> Wait I thought you aleady had those weird slug charge rounds?
[6:09:48] <%ComfortableStranger> dual wield shotguns, shotgun akimbo
[6:09:49] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt The Geth shotgun is the best one tho
[6:09:51] <jackelzxaa> Its the dlc shotgun
[6:09:52] <%GinAndRoses> with a name like eviscerator it has to be good
[6:09:55] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Do we have any more crew to get?
[6:09:55] <jackelzxaa> So its good
[6:10:06] <jackelzxaa> The geth plasma shotgun is basically a charge blaster
[6:10:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> The Eviscerator is the best shotgun. The geth shotgun is not a shotgun.
[6:10:14] <%ComfortableStranger> @TurtlesAndTentacles tons
[6:10:21] <HaroldDonchee> weird they took out stats
[6:10:21] <tanarath> HAMSTER
[6:10:22] <jorniev> PROBE URANUS
[6:10:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> The geth shotgun is the shotgun for people who don't want to use a shotgun.
[6:10:30] <sweatch0> Good night lads
[6:10:31] <KeystoneA2> I like how everyone knows its Shepard even if he wears the Recon Hood
[6:10:31] <jackelzxaa> Geth has to charge so its not ad good for vanguard
[6:10:31] <%ComfortableStranger> *claps*
[6:10:33] <%maskedsongbird> The one nice thing about the way that ME2 and 3 does weapons is that pretty much every loadout is viable to some degree.\
[6:10:33] <ScreamLord> Geth Shotty or M300 are the best shotguns
[6:10:34] <%AzureGale> MASS EFFECT 4!?!?!?!?!?!?!??
[6:10:36] <RushUnplugged> arguable, Geth shotgun is a long range option with charge, the Eviscerator is the best at short range like the Vanguard plays
[6:10:38] <Samurai_Tchan> WOW, 6 HOURS STREAM
[6:10:38] <%weissguard> Thanks for stream
[6:10:39] <+D00msDayDan> mass effect 4?

[6:10:50] <peachy996> Looking forward to meeting Warlord Okeer. For the brief time you talk to him
[6:10:51] <jackelzxaa> Geth shotgun is for people who want a shotgun but arent vanguard charging

[6:13:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> NOPE
[6:13:27] <DatAsuna> she gives you a lapdance
[6:13:29] <+Ropcord> LUL
[6:13:31] <RushUnplugged> boneancer
[6:13:34] <%Bane_Kaikyo> YOU CAN BONE KELLY?!?!?
[6:13:35] <%goose_attack_almanac> Don't get to bone. Only dance.
[6:13:36] <%AzureGale> LUL
[6:13:36] <%dekkitout> No way
[6:13:37] <%ComfortableStranger> no sex scene tho
[6:13:38] <+iAmAceGaming> yup!
[6:13:39] <tanarath> Yeah, you can totes bone her
[6:13:40] <%MidnightBurst12> yep
[6:13:40] <DatAsuna> your friends lied to you
[6:13:42] <peachy996> Kelly can die in 3.
[6:13:42] <%X2Eliah> you can
[6:13:47] <stantheman_97> HELL YEAH BABY
[6:13:50] <+justianxix> you can do it again in 3 right?
[6:13:51] <jackelzxaa> Kelly isnt a real romance so it doesnt count as cheating
[6:13:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> Kelly probably smells like Varren
[6:13:52] <Archmortal> you in fact HAVE to romance her if you want those fish to survive
[6:13:54] <dashmatt> Just banging the secretary
[6:13:55] <+FelIian> @peachy996 she can die in 2
[6:13:56] <$RealThiele> doesnt kelly watch your fish if you bone?
[6:13:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Kelly is in-canon a slut.
[6:13:57] <%X2Eliah> Kelly can die in 3 IF she lives in 2
[6:13:58] <jackelzxaa> But you do get semi romance content
[6:14:02] <Goraka91> Let's be real Kelly is boning everyone and everything on the ship
[6:14:05] <TheApeGatsby> If you romance her she feeds her fish for you and shows up in 3 and its not even considered cheating so...
[6:14:06] <%dekkitout> Oh, just shag pals
[6:14:06] <%Bane_Kaikyo> THEY LIED TO MEE!!
[6:14:07] <peachy996> Kelly gets offed so unceremoniouslly in 3
[6:14:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> Fun fact: Banging your secretary in 3 is the best lesbian romance in any of the games. Not joking.
[6:14:23] <jackelzxaa> You can bone jack without it counting, but it locks you out of her paragon content
[6:14:34] <%ComfortableStranger> if you don't ask Kelly to change  her name Cerberus kills her
[6:14:35] <%X2Eliah> @Too_Much_Nukie tru
[6:14:43] <%QueequegTheater> NO
[6:14:50] <%QueequegTheater> VERY WRONG
[6:14:52] <%QueequegTheater> REEEEE
[6:14:55] <peachy996> @FelIian yeah but in 3 it's just out of left field
[6:14:57] <%AncelDeLambert> no Pat, that was the declaration
[6:15:02] <%dekkitout> Still afraid of Mt. Rushmore right?
[6:15:13] <%AncelDeLambert> and would also be when it officially became a REVOLUTIONARY ar
[6:15:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> They could wear visors.
[6:15:15] <%AncelDeLambert> *war
[6:15:24] <%DianaTheAscian> they can wear helmets
[6:15:33] <bob900000> it was Abraham Lincoln
[6:15:35] <jackelzxaa> Turians can wear hoods
[6:15:43] <%X2Eliah> Turians wear little socks on their heads
[6:15:51] <%AzureGale> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[6:15:54] <dashmatt> Not a good idea
[6:15:58] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> you mean  LukeLooksAt
[6:16:03] <peachy996> Cute little headsocks
[6:16:03] <Profmcstevie> No cos Gief would run amok
[6:16:06] <%42nfl19> You can get chipped doggy doors
[6:16:09] <%AncelDeLambert> bring the babies inside
[6:16:09] <%DianaTheAscian> Can he even fit through the door?
[6:16:10] <bob900000> do people even use those anymore
[6:16:12] <%RigmaroleHM> Keep indoor creatures indoors
[6:16:13] <%X2Eliah> Luke-uh!
[6:16:16] <%AncelDeLambert> if you're cold they're cold
[6:16:16] <%Chichen> do they even make doggy doors big enough?
[6:16:17] <%machshop> elmo doesn't know what outside  is
[6:16:23] <Srthunda> you can barricade it at night
[6:16:30] <peachy996> Joram Talid is definitely interested in making the Citadel great again

[6:16:33] <+DinnerCalzone> EMLO
[6:16:34] <DatAsuna> yeah bio chip door
[6:16:34] <%X2Eliah> Canada has actual bears
[6:16:34] <%42nfl19> thats just a normal door
[6:16:34] <%AncelDeLambert> it would be half th edoor
[6:16:35] <vilecrois> a dog garage door
[6:16:37] <$BlackMage66652> BABY
[6:16:38] <RushUnplugged> doggy door for Gief is a garage door
[6:16:40] <A0N33> CRAZY TALK
[6:16:40] <%RigmaroleHM> My neighbors use doggie doors unfortunately. They go outside whenever they want and bark endlessly
[6:16:41] <%ComfortableStranger> elmo
[6:16:42] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> ELMO
[6:16:42] <%AzureGale> A Gief doggy door is just a door
[6:16:43] <%X2Eliah> Like, Canadian cities have bears roaming in them
[6:16:44] <DatAsuna> he woudl totes chase a car
[6:16:45] <MildMannered_Creighton> L I A B I L I T T

[6:16:54] <%dekkitout> Doggy dumbwaiter lift
[6:16:55] <bob900000> elmo
[6:17:02] <MildMannered_Creighton> Sorry, chat
[6:17:16] <%X2Eliah> Doggie door just seems like an easy way to get racoons to break in
[6:17:32] <peachy996> The Armor cheat is beneficial
[6:17:39] <DatAsuna> the poison swamp will be HUGE
[6:17:42] <%wibbwobbler> Zangief just out and about
[6:17:45] <peachy996> I hear it's still in there
[6:17:46] <%dekkitout> What will shortcut porn become
[6:17:52] <NireFuster> The maps and dungeons are allegedly connected in elden ring so that's huge hype for me
[6:17:57] <dashmatt> That's true
[6:17:59] <%ComfortableStranger> tru
[6:18:00] <Profmcstevie> Bloodborne just looked like dark souls BUT LONDON, the gameplay is distinct when it's in your hands
[6:18:02] <%machshop> yeppp
[6:18:03] <%X2Eliah> It will make replays so much more fun
