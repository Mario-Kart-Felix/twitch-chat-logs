[0:05:42] <user_naim> Could Pat stop ballin‚Äô for one minute? Give ol‚Äô Jaffe a second to catch his breath
[0:05:44] <%StaceMcGate> "People who want greatness crunch, people who don't crunch just see it as a job"

[0:06:45] <rReizs> will this get on scrubquotes
[0:06:53] <+michingmallecho> Alright I‚Äôm done with Jaffe, he‚Äôs got a blind spot for the game industry completely

[0:19:00] <teflonbilly777> FFXIV, the game so good they made it twice!
[0:19:01] <mattdaddyd101> Uh here man hold this dick

[0:19:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> So what happened on the twitters?
[0:19:17] <%BubbaRands> Yeah but he does it by choice
[0:19:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> red dead 2 could have been great without crunch or horse balls
[0:19:18] <aeonicVector> He's also actively prevented from Crunching by other Square heads
[0:19:19] <rReizs> BUT HOW WILL I FUNCTION WITHOUT EVERYONE BELOW ME DYING
[0:19:19] <%Bailey__gaming> crunchy assholes
[0:19:19] <Siconia> Hey pat just came to congratulate you on your fat internet dub bossman
[0:19:20] <%ironohki> Bungie treats it's employees super good. How come Destiny 2 sucks? (Got 'em.)
[0:19:22] <dabuurd> Oh no, you got your worker's rights in my videogame industry!
[0:19:24] <%Monkeyweed21> Crunch literally ruined my parents marriage fuck anyone who defends it
[0:19:24] <pissdegaulle> 0.
[0:19:24] <%hewlettfan96> That is stellar
[0:19:25] <Top_Lane_Duelist> an unfortunate necessary evil ofr his staff
[0:19:25] <%StaceMcGate> you can send Soken home, but he will continue to work
[0:19:26] <$THE_TERRORIZER> I kinda wanna get back into FFXIV but it nearly ruined my life it was so fun
[0:19:28] <fatalDestiny> God I wish that was my company, we're currently discussing requiring people to work weekends with no extra compensation.
[0:19:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> Chronching is only ok if you're self-employed and living a healthy lifestyle.
[0:19:28] <%JoshManVGH> Dog keyboard immunity too high
[0:19:29] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Considering FF14 is a Japanese game it is quite a feat that they purposefully avoid crunch
[0:19:29] <Laioken13> they also don't have to worry about being fired if they eat or use the bathroom
[0:19:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> I just saw the twitter stuff. What's up with that guy?
[0:19:34] <rcand9> good boy
[0:19:35] <%JoshManVGH> Sucking?

[0:19:39] <%JobbedBone> is it crunch if you're doing it yourself though? Isn't that just passionate overtime?
[0:19:40] <%Skelefellah> Couch burgers
[0:19:41] <teflonbilly777> Buy a gigantic pacifier for him
[0:19:41] <+sparkjavelin> but did they crunch BEFORE A Realm Reborn?
[0:19:44] <%hewlettfan96> Go to horny jail zangief
[0:19:45] <iosephe> He crunches for their work life balance
[0:19:45] <%JoshManVGH> The dog is suckling your couch?
[0:19:46] <BigFingerRo> Crunching yourself is ok, it's a choice, crunching employees and then not paying them is not
[0:19:48] <orpleborple> geify sounds like me after the gym
[0:19:48] <brisk_dacat> This dog thinks everything is food'
[0:19:48] <flame_of_udun_> LMAO

[0:41:29] <%ToadKing> same
[0:41:30] <%Crookedspiral> american cops always figure out a way
[0:41:30] <Visorak6> depends on the state pat
[0:41:31] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Cops in active pursuit of an offender
[0:41:31] <Profmcstevie> ....we thought that was default
[0:41:32] <%peanutdot007> They could for dumb reasons
[0:41:32] <%pilgrimsayswhat> cops arent supposed to do a lot of things tbf
[0:41:33] <shadowstreakXIII> SO ABOUT THAT
[0:41:33] <@JustinianKnight> probably not on a federal level?
[0:41:34] <intestinal_bleeding> oh they don't care lol
[0:41:34] <%neroforte177> hey man laws are hard
[0:41:35] <%Ranryu692> they can if they have "probable cause"
[0:41:36] <%pokefan9956> HAHA. Riiiiight
[0:41:36] <nocturnPhoenix> Cops in America can basically do whatever the fuck
[0:41:36] <%Meidolaon> Toby, fam, you really haven't ever actually played Fate huh? Like, never mind that the original has an all ages version
[0:41:36] <+michingmallecho> ‚Ä¶.ummm
[0:41:38] <Visorak6> Its a federal ruling
[0:41:38] <%Puhff> yeah youd think huh
[0:41:38] <+michingmallecho> Hmmm
[0:41:39] <%JoshManVGH> Not in america. They can do it if the fw9gn probable cause
[0:41:40] <bob900000> it depends
[0:41:40] <Daniel_Is_I> Well yeah but just because they're not allowed doesn't mean they WON'T
[0:41:41] <iosephe> do you think that'll stop them?
[0:41:41] <%Garthunox> They can if they have probable cause
[0:41:41] <SomeAsianDood> PROBABLE CAUSE PROBABLE CAUSE
[0:41:43] <AthenaAegis> LMAO, that's was a good one Pat Kappa
[0:41:44] <Kief_Meister> hey Pat I didn't sign up to see a murder today on twitter but you gave it to me anyway so thank you LMAOOOOO
[0:41:44] <Teyaric> As if that's ever stopped anyone
[0:41:44] <Top_Lane_Duelist> fuck cops
[0:41:45] <shadowstreakXIII> some times
[0:41:48] <Psyramics> yeah, we're like 80% of the way to a police state over here
[0:41:48] <brisk_dacat> hahah silly pat
[0:41:49] <%pokefan9956> haha. this shit sucks
[0:41:49] <+Totally_Not_Toby> i don't think this person knows about law enforcement
[0:41:49] <%QueequegTheater> For MINOR crimes only
[0:41:49] <+michingmallecho> I‚Äôm confused but happy?
[0:41:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Only if they can see or hear something incriminating from the front door @PatStaresAt
[0:41:52] <faldin> You think cops follow rules
[0:41:52] <CyborgAV> Cops do a lot of things they shouldn't all the time!
[0:41:52] <dabuurd> Plain sight and eminent danger apply to entrance without a warrant
[0:41:53] <@SoFarFetched> LOOP HOLES IS MY TL;DR
[0:41:53] <teflonbilly777> They have a color chart
[0:41:53] <%emperordread> If they suspect someone is in danger they can (spoilers: they fake it)
[0:41:54] <farrellcityking> Unless you‚Äôre black. Then none of those laws apply
[0:41:54] <sendart> Bullshit ways around getting a warrant
[0:41:55] <%Meidolaon> There hasn't been porn in Fate since like 2005
[0:41:55] <dabuurd> ie a scream
[0:41:56] <%StaceMcGate> David Jaffe is still talking about Pat, his mods are calling Pat a coward
[0:41:56] <%ComfortableStranger> CLEAR and Present DANGER
[0:41:56] <%Puhff> or ya know, they just get the house wrong
[0:41:57] <%skeleklng> Case started 'cause a guy didn't pull over for police for playing loud music and the cop just walked straight into his home
[0:41:57] <%MelBrooksKA> Probable cause maybe?
[0:41:57] <@JustinianKnight> theres a difference between state and federal rulings on it
[0:41:57] <%AncelDeLambert> when have the rules ever stopeed cops?
[0:41:58] <+Buzzkill983> Now the judges are like, yeah that's still the law lmao
[0:42:01] <%Pukenasty> they can if the think a "crime" is being commited
[0:42:02] <thendtoal> Hey!
[0:42:02] <%Crookedspiral> smell a weed

[0:42:05] <KidKaiser23> ACAB
[0:42:06] <bob900000> yup
[0:42:06] <nocturnPhoenix> YES EXACTLY
[0:42:06] <roz_en> that is the case? like its a fucking amendment
[0:42:06] <%AncelDeLambert> yep
[0:42:06] <%pilgrimsayswhat> and they do
[0:42:06] <%emperordread> YES
[0:42:06] <%Torus1025> Yes
[0:42:07] <TurtlesAndTentacles> HA You forgot they dont care about MINORITIES. Cops break rules ALL the time
[0:42:08] <iosephe> yes
[0:42:08] <%pokefan9956> yes
[0:42:08] <Visorak6> Yep
[0:42:09] <%skeleklng> @PatStaresAt Case started 'cause a guy didn't pull over for police for playing loud music and the cop just walked straight into his home
[0:42:10] <%neroforte177> yup
[0:42:10] <+Totally_Not_Toby> smell doesn't count
[0:42:10] <$hattrick61> probable cause
[0:42:11] <%MajorCrasher> yes
[0:42:11] <Prism_Wing> lol I'm sure they'll follow that rule Kappa

[0:42:12] <%MelBrooksKA> yes
[0:42:12] <thelonechris> Shhhhhh
[0:42:13] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Yes
[0:42:14] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Basically the SC is reaffirming something, it's not huge news
[0:42:14] <+ArtsyFoxo> yup
[0:42:15] <+leondatwani> America be crazy like that

[0:42:16] <intestinal_bleeding> so nothing changed lol
[0:42:16] <+fetrigon> ye OMEGALUL
[0:42:17] <Explodincatz> yup
[0:42:17] <+michingmallecho> Acab
[0:42:17] <Dunmarkh> yeah that shit happens all the time
[0:42:17] <dabuurd> but they do tend to totally fucking bend the rules all the time
[0:42:19] <%Pukenasty> yup
[0:42:20] <Psyramics> you mean lie? Like police do all the time?
[0:42:20] <T_Sasquatch> Sprinkle some crack on him
[0:42:20] <%wibbwobbler> Was probable cause in question?
[0:42:21] <+Kyma1020> Different states are lax due to "Probable Cause"
[0:42:23] <+lordericter> cops used to be able to just kick down doors because they could smell pot
[0:42:25] <%pilgrimsayswhat> acab
[0:42:27] <%DianaTheAscian> yes thats the problum
[0:42:28] <@StridentSong> There are three reasons I can think of that don't require a warrant: Probable Cause, Extenuating Circumstances, and if they ask to enter and you you don't decline them
[0:42:28] <dabuurd> entering homes just cause the door was open
[0:42:29] <+Seitine> Yup. Took my damn bong that way.
[0:42:30] <NavigatorBR> So, cops can't chase you into your house over minior shit, like your car radio being too loud.
[0:42:31] <Sain_127> mr pat
[0:42:32] <farrellcityking> Those laws don‚Äôt apply to black citizens.
[0:42:32] <jomomma2020> Heroine
[0:42:34] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Nestle Crunch
[0:42:34] <%ComfortableStranger> if someone screams "help I'm getting murdered", they can enter
[0:42:37] <%Dakuu75> good sentence, dono-man
[0:42:38] <%Bt_Robot> If they suspect a crime is being committed
[0:42:38] <WolfGr33d> Cops can basically do anything if mayors pay them enough to do it. Like straight up ignoring constitutional rights for example
[0:42:38] <wolfen091> yes, they have a probable cause thing
[0:42:39] <%condemned_15> Ya'll hear John McAffee is fuckin dead in a Spanish Prison?

[0:44:39] <+ReiDuran> So about the whole Cliffy B thing I have a post he made on SomethingAwful where he said that the age of consent should be 14, but I'm not ENTIRELY sure if it's true or not.
[0:44:42] <%Dakuu75> I'm always hoping Gief or Elmo will knock opver the camera, live on stream
[0:44:56] <bob900000> yup
[0:45:00] <+MosesUnspoken> Yup, they need the attention
[0:45:05] <+wmeldrum> game crunch is just blood magic with more steps
[0:45:06] <%FallenAngelZelos> Pat is oozing power today.
[0:45:11] <%peanutdot007> You have to really feel the impotent rage and helplessness to properly make Kratos obviously
[0:45:12] <sendart> He was so quick to try to get you on a podcast
[0:45:12] <%QueequegTheater> I had to stop listening to Jaffe's stream after three minutes. Holy shit, there are dictators less up their own ass
[0:45:12] <%asgard147> Wait, did you murder jaffy on twitter again?

One of my favorite things about R&C is that a lot of the gadgets you earned in the original games have just been rolled into Ratchet's main moveset, like the Hookshot and jet boots. If only he could teach Samus how to hold onto her stuff for Dred.
[0:58:02] <%AzureGale> @emMmDeeKay Oh lol, no, he's just checking to make sure it isn't serious

[1:01:42] <NireFuster> NO crunch? That's ridiculous Pat!
[1:01:43] <+TopTieramisu> you don't understand, pat. people are cruel
[1:01:43] <+vicar_anat> Only the gods know
[1:01:44] <%StaceMcGate> the 0 load times are impressive
[1:01:45] <Jolly_Adventurer> Impossible
[1:01:47] <%ironohki> But pat, you don't work in the gaming industry, how are you such an expert on Crunch?
[1:01:49] <%BubbaRands> i bet there's little bugs to speak of either LUL
[1:01:50] <TurtlesAndTentacles> no
[1:01:51] <%JoshManVGH> How could this be!!!
[1:01:54] <%SaiyanShoto> Can you believe these employees were actually paid for their time?
[1:01:54] <Daniel_Is_I> I can, because Insomniac makes great games
[1:01:56] <%MugenSandan> Obviously they're HIDING THE CRUNCH
[1:01:58] <%Agami23> jaffe said insomniac employees lied and that there was crunch. but whos to say what is true now?
[1:01:58] <+WarbossMetal> look at what game devs can do when they're allowed to see their families
[1:01:58] <GoodnightSnek> You mean to tell me treating employees fairly can lead to AMAZING products???
[1:01:59] <+SammyOVision> But how can something good be made without making people suffer?
[1:02:01] <+capnbeefs> Is that a fucking keyblade, are you for fucking real
[1:02:03] <nauskills> This game look so good
[1:02:07] <%hewlettfan96> Holy hell this game is a work of art
[1:02:07] <swift_malachi> This is EASILY the showcase game for the PS5
[1:02:09] <%TacoSaIad> lol his stream is titled "why is this man so angry?" sounds like Jaffe is the angry one.
[1:02:10] <%ItalianWaifu> but there must be crunch for we participate in society
[1:02:11] <%psidefx> K I T
[1:02:15] <$Ziegsy> theres quite a few bugs still. But i think its more to do with how fast it is
[1:02:15] <%StaceMcGate> TIMESTOP
[1:02:15] <emMmDeeKay> you get that later pat
[1:02:18] <%ironohki> @SaiyanShoto They might have even not fired them all and retired super wealthy like a dirtbag.

[1:02:27] <Storm_Samurai> @swift_malachi easily.
[1:02:29] <Sunstalker> Does any of the work Jaffe ever did even fall in the category of the jobs that would get crunch? isn't he more the type of position to CAUSE crunch?
[1:02:33] <$SGrim> Is fucking the Lombussy only gay is the Lorbs touch? KappaPride
[1:02:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> there'sa thing you don't have yet
[1:02:33] <Wydamn> Wow, how can this be such a good game without crunching the development staff?
[1:02:34] <%Dakuu75> @swift_malachi I was expecting it to be demon souls but, yeah-no. You right
[1:02:38] <butthurtdave> Somebody talked about how crunch is bad and he started talking about nazis and republicans
[1:02:40] <$SGrim> if*
[1:02:42] <SaltyAzteca> HAH
[1:02:45] <nauskills> Nice loading screen
[1:02:45] <%einterblathnir> Hey pat do you think this game is worth buying a PS5 for? As of now it's the only thing I've seen that makes me interested in getting one.
[1:02:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am at endgame, I am just grinding my weapons

[1:03:48] <Storm_Samurai> @PatStaresAt are you aware that you don't need to wear armor to gain armor benefits, they are passive buffs
[1:03:50] <%hewlettfan96> This is one of the most beautiful games I‚Äôve seen
[1:03:50] <s1rcuit> @copametic unlockable skin thing
[1:03:50] <JackalKing> Man Clank is so shiny

[1:04:11] <bonebagMEL> Is that a legally distinct Keysword?
[1:04:14] <Tisaric> come on
[1:04:14] <romc215> So, Clank is a better partner to Rivet than Ratchet?

[1:04:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I think crouch jump hasn't been a thing for a while
[1:04:27] <+KoryMccool> HIS left

[1:04:34] <+TopTieramisu> is this the game where ratchet and clank part ways?
[1:04:36] <%JoshManVGH> That's a neat detail if intentional!
[1:04:38] <Broken_Sonex> It's like poetry. They both have arm problems.
[1:04:40] <%ssjklyco> Pat, you're pulling a paige
[1:04:40] <+teh_rawk> this looks like a good videogame

[1:05:59] <Tisaric> Pat understands the left/right just fine
[1:05:59] <flame_of_udun_> Gief must conserve his energy for more ball punching
[1:06:00] <brisk_dacat> they did sonic mania
[1:06:01] <%Skelefellah> Hospitable Shiny.
[1:06:01] <+teh_rawk> would be nice
[1:06:04] <%hamborgini> yeah, but surely they'd have to crunch to make sonic good
[1:06:04] <%Dfreddy8> Should we speak like sailors then?
[1:06:06] <+tkzhyon> wow ratchet has cool costumes?
[1:06:06] <emMmDeeKay> @sonofthedeepsouth yup

[1:06:28] <butthurtdave> THAT'S RAD
[1:06:30] <zanzibarian_hamster> He lost his stage right arm, audience left arm
[1:06:31] <HipHopAnonymous23> @sonofthedeepsouth Shes Ratchet's counterpart in this dimention
[1:06:32] <$Ziegsy> @patstaresat you get a quiet stadium cheer when it triggers too
[1:06:32] <BigFingerRo> hey @BallerSwagBro9k may I ask what song you used in Pat compilation #4? It was some form of electroswing, not the lonely digger remix, the second one
[1:06:34] <flame_of_udun_> OH SHIT
[1:06:38] <flame_of_udun_> WTF THATS RAD
[1:06:40] <awalbaru> HUZZA
[1:06:40] <Broken_Sonex> Suddenly Chat is Woolie. It's his right arm everyone
[1:06:44] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Is this another gumbo game
[1:06:49] <%BinaryFireball> does clank annoy anyone else?
[1:06:50] <%DedlokPM> Pat diving into that Lombussy again I see
[1:06:54] <%BinaryFireball> am I a bad person?
[1:06:58] <%AzureGale> The Fixer sounds like a series on the USA channel :x
[1:06:59] <ergulor> ok just confirmed i was wrong is his right arm
[1:06:59] <Danny_Belnades> Which mode are you using Pat?
[1:07:02] <%Torus1025> This is a better KH game than 3 was
[1:07:02] <$Ziegsy> teddy bear alert
[1:07:05] <%AzureGale> HICCUP
[1:07:05] <flame_of_udun_> @binaryfireball probably Kappa
[1:07:06] <%StaceMcGate> HIC
[1:07:09] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Pat Hiccups
[1:07:09] <Daniel_Is_I> Getting hit in the nuts caused hiccups
[1:07:10] <emMmDeeKay> Hiccup time
[1:07:10] <$lotharrio> I find Clank lacking in charisma.
[1:07:14] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt With this Keyblade, you make Ratchet look like Sonic's heartless or sumthin'
[1:07:17] <%QueequegTheater> @BinaryFireball do you prefer crunchy peanut butter or smooth?
[1:07:18] <%BinaryFireball> @flame_of_udun_ thank god
[1:07:19] <awalbaru> @BinaryFireball maybe we all are
[1:07:20] <%Dakuu75> pat's balls are now a DoT
[1:07:20] <Profmcstevie> ......some beastly hiccup sounds
[1:07:20] <%ironohki> David Kaye sounds kinda like Noland North.
[1:07:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh hellow amelia watson, wasn't aware you were here
[1:07:25] <%YakumoYomi> ToxHIC
[1:07:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> @HipHopAnonymous23 Oh so is this dimension the males don't have tails? thats interesting
[1:07:27] <emMmDeeKay> How to train your Lombussy
[1:07:28] <jomomma2020> Well he is a robot
[1:07:32] <+tkzhyon> are you playing as ratchet or that new character?
[1:07:33] <%ape_hawk> what?
[1:07:39] <%BinaryFireball> @QueequegTheater crunchy laura scudder's
[1:07:41] <SPidERMan8576> Is this kingdom hearts?
[1:07:44] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Why would there be a magnitized walk way there?
[1:07:44] <s1rcuit> @BinaryFireball you're only a bad person if you try to hurt people because of their personalities
[1:07:44] <brisk_dacat> his dad technically
[1:07:45] <%BinaryFireball> stir that shit
[1:07:49] <%ironohki> New critter
[1:07:50] <flame_of_udun_> @binaryfireball I meant you‚Äôre probably as bad person lol (I‚Äôm joking)
[1:07:50] <+SocialMisfitGamer> That goes upside-down
[1:07:50] <+teh_rawk> reminder that clank is canonically the hero
[1:07:52] <%AzureGale> @tkzhyon He's playing as Rivet
[1:07:52] <zanzibarian_hamster> He's a lot more robotic than he was in earlier games though
[1:07:53] <%QueequegTheater> @BinaryFireball then yes you are a bad person
[1:07:59] <nauskills> wow
[1:08:00] <%DedlokPM> @tkzhyon color of tail indicates Rivet
[1:08:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> This is actuially final fantasy 14 Kappa
[1:08:10] <zanzibarian_hamster> He used to laugh and be sarky
[1:08:17] <%BinaryFireball> @s1rcuit I just try to hurt everything and everyone equally
[1:08:17] <awalbaru> Final Fantasy spin off
[1:08:18] <%QueequegTheater> Is there a setting to make it permanently Rivet
[1:08:19] <%Dakuu75> Question: Can you turn off that half-button-press thing on the PS5 triggers?
[1:08:20] <+tkzhyon> @DedlokPM thanks
[1:08:22] <Tisaric> @sonofthedeepsouth I think the whole lombax biology lore kind of went out the window a while ago
[1:08:24] <%BinaryFireball> @flame_of_udun_ thank god

[1:08:41] <%QueequegTheater> Just replace Ratchet in the timeline with the Lombussy, it's fine
[1:08:41] <brisk_dacat> full contact poety sounds awesome
[1:08:42] <Tisaric> considering they used to also not be extinct
[1:08:44] <penitentpendant> @awalbaru There's not enough CHAOS for that to be true
[1:08:46] <Profmcstevie> oooh that blueprints coming together
[1:08:54] <ScreamLord> Full Contact Poetry Slam sounds amazing
[1:08:55] <%topendbuzza> I think u missed a spybot on an another level
[1:08:55] <Dova573> I beat that Krogan poet would be great at full contanct poetry slams
[1:08:56] <butthurtdave> CHAOS
[1:09:01] <jomomma2020> Info bots are cool
[1:09:03] <%saiyanblitz> Poetry Slam?

[1:10:00] <Dunmarkh> new fun bois
[1:10:00] <andrewofbob> The tail thing is up in the air; Angela Cross didn't have a tail, was alluded to in a Crack in Time as sexual dimorphism, then Cross kinda faded out of continuity, then this game mentions an Agela again
[1:10:01] <Daxalog> The CLASSICS
[1:10:02] <%ospreyworks> zim???
[1:10:02] <+GingerStrawhat> THE most over powered weapon combo is Doom Glove and Fungi
[1:10:02] <%QueequegTheater> DOOMBOTS
[1:10:04] <%AzureGale> Never gets old
[1:10:05] <%pilgrimsayswhat> thank you Zim

[1:10:22] <+BIumen> he said the thing
[1:10:24] <%JoshManVGH> When managers are all "crunch is required" how many of those crunch hours do you all think they are working?
[1:10:25] <+SuperMonk4Ever> Wait... are the collectables changed to the soda from Sunset Overdrive?
[1:10:26] <%williamrooster> thats just robo zim

[1:10:33] <SaltyAzteca> Upgraded ricochet?
[1:10:34] <Profmcstevie> richochet saws
[1:10:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Buzz Blades are better for bosses
[1:10:34] <%machshop> it's that one amazon skill in D2
[1:10:35] <romc215> Funny how Clank doesn't react to seeing Ratchet in the weapon demos
[1:10:39] <%ScottishMadJacko> Buzz blades are my personal fav
[1:10:40] <+BIumen> @SuperMonk4Ever yep it's an option
[1:10:40] <%saadi90> Ripper Chan
[1:10:40] <%Mrbaconator> tool of destruction
[1:10:41] <Daxalog> They bounce by default now!?
[1:10:42] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @supermonk4ever yes!
[1:10:43] <Tisaric> I fucking love that they bring back guns from the old games but give them new upgrades
[1:10:44] <zanzibarian_hamster> How are they getting this footage of ratchet canonically?
[1:10:45] <butthurtdave> JEEZ there are a LOT of guns in this one
[1:10:48] <jomomma2020> Is Mr Zurkon still the best weapon in the game?
[1:10:50] <Daniel_Is_I> This is just a Best-Of of all of the coolest weapons in the series, isn't it?
[1:10:52] <%Wallabri> RIP Richard Horvitz's vocal chords
[1:10:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Gloves of Dooms are great for defense except flyers
[1:11:15] <Daxalog> Thats just Richard Horvitz normal voice.
[1:11:19] <%Dakuu75> "Junkish"
[1:11:20] <%AzureGale> @Daniel_Is_I No, but most of the weapons in this game are pretty good
[1:11:21] <%DedlokPM> @Wallabri He has been yelling like that for years now. I am sure they are fine
[1:11:23] <nauskills> This guy has the strongest back
[1:11:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> mmmm

[1:12:57] <%Kirby_Sauce> @QueequegTheater the designer explicitly said that was his intent
[1:12:57] <andrewofbob> I mean, we had Death Stranding's backpacks... and that was meant to be pseudorealistic
[1:13:02] <flame_of_udun_> STOP
[1:13:02] <ScreamLord> And that complication is called Alistar Azimuth

[1:16:29] <+alphonseisbest> @tkzhyon the meaning is the same
[1:16:30] <%twistedj3ster> it can't be a keyblade because ONLY ONE person can wield it

[1:26:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> freezing anything AND makes them take more damage
[1:26:59] <auraofdawn> they flowers it pretty
[1:26:59] <+SocialMisfitGamer> It's meant to a "take a breather" weapon
[1:27:00] <theinfamousq> do you have a fire weapon? would it not burn them better?
[1:27:01] <%JoshManVGH> Freeze them and let the Funguys take care of it.
[1:27:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and works on bosses
[1:27:04] <rReizs> do you not use low blow on dark knight
[1:27:04] <%SolidusRex> Enemies take more damage when grassed

[1:29:34] <%AzureGale> And if they don't dance
[1:29:35] <%Skelefellah> It does less damage, but it does act fast if you mash
[1:29:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> i still don't know a good way to kill Shield Guys without the certain weapons
[1:29:40] <%AzureGale> Well, they're no friends of mine

[1:34:59] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt When do we unlock the Plague SFM dimension
[1:34:59] <+GingerStrawhat> It's why they pair so well with Fungi, he takes out the air and they take out the ground and last much longer
[1:35:02] <BigFingerRo> its the smell of bad lombussy , Rivet
[1:35:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Press X to Doubt hard
[1:35:07] <scarman125> I'm sad that Pat stopped using Fungi
[1:35:08] <coreybom> @queequegtheater JAFFE was the one with that doom take?! By god that man needs some serious help, you know, along with the crunching.
[1:35:33] <%QueequegTheater> @coreybom oh wait I thought you meant the earlier thing

[1:36:12] <%StewTheGreat> StewTheGreat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[1:36:12] <%QueequegTheater> Instead of being really mad, Doomguy is now tall Naruto
[1:36:13] <%Skelefellah> Nice recovery
[1:36:15] <flame_of_udun_> Let him stew in his own salt
[1:36:19] <scarman125> okay so apparently the reason this stream was skipping back every minute or so was because I had quality set to Auto. doesn't explain why it was only happening here but it's fixed.

[1:36:28] <+SocialMisfitGamer> @PatStaresAt G.O.D is kinda the opposite. The glove spawn many bots that attack and despawn simultaneously and instantly while Fungi/Fungal (re-purposed Zurkon) keeps shooting on a time limit

[1:37:38] <%QueequegTheater> @xhodocto385 all his power and ability is not actually due to his own merit, but bestowed upon him by an outside force
[1:37:39] <romc215> Its Doom Guy's armor but in Lombax form... Doombax armor if you would
[1:37:44] <%QueequegTheater> ruined
[1:37:49] <scarman125> how come Rivet and Ratchet share the same weapons and ammo

[1:37:54] <%sjay662> Doombussy
[1:37:55] <coreybom> @queequegtheater Queequeg, we just gotta agree to disagree on this one. I felt that eternal just built on doomguys reputation. But hey, different strokes for different folks.
[1:37:59] <penitentpendant> @FstSergeant8595 You were focused on function, not form
[1:37:59] <scarman125> Weapons and upgrades*
[1:38:02] <BigFingerRo> @romc215 doombussy?
[1:38:03] <romc215> Space magic

[1:38:09] <+Keith_e> because they are the same person from different dimensions
[1:38:09] <SomeAsianDood> no but shut up though @scarman125
[1:38:10] <%AzureGale> @scarman125 Because space technology I guess
[1:38:11] <+fetrigon> This game is fucking amazing
[1:38:13] <+TopTieramisu> because not every game will have a vergil
[1:38:15] <%Skelefellah> Ms Zurkon mentioned a shared account in the game's start
[1:38:16] <%QueequegTheater> @flame_of_udun_ never
[1:38:16] <%hrbeck_> I'd a doomgirl if she furry
[1:38:18] <Dova573> Also they shared the same weapons buyers account

[1:39:12] <$SGrim> Best gun
[1:39:14] <%BinaryFireball> I hope ratchet gets to the lombax dimension to discover that he is and incredibly mediocre lombax. He then struggles to cope with this and gets a real estate job in an attempt to settle down
[1:39:17] <morningmoondude> this game can let you go fucking insane with crowd control

[2:12:02] <+RoByte2> Super Metroid starts with "the baby" you have to like it
[2:12:02] <bakkatohri> The 2D Metroid games are fun, I guess. Some of the fun comes from speed running them after you memorized all the layouts though.
[2:12:04] <$12gagerager> Plenty of older games that didn't age well, if you can put yourself in the mindset and reset your expectations for the time it's not bad.
[2:12:05] <PineapplePlatypus> What's so super about the metro?

[2:24:44] <jorniev> You know, it would be really funny if the IP EA brought back was ANTHEM instead of dead space
[2:24:46] <Brandon__Brando> can we get a sly Cooper game plz
[2:24:49] <%putnampuppeteer> The fact that they recorded voice lines for the plantified enemies is really great
[2:24:50] <xhodocto385> and Nefarious went into villainy because someone bullied him as a kid LUL
[2:24:59] <%Kitafin> you should upgrade it

[2:25:37] <%Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 he said it was fixed (at least relatively speaking) a few weeks ago, unless I missed it breaking again
[2:25:38] <bakkatohri> Yakuza makes the same game over and over ( kind of ), but it's still a good series.
[2:25:49] <%Monkeyweed21> psABlind
[2:25:53] <%Monkeyweed21> psaBlind
[2:25:55] <crassplay_> @jorniev Didn't they just kill the potential reboot in April?
[2:26:00] <bakkatohri> But I could do without all the cringy sex stuff like in Yakuza 4, 0, and Kiwami
[2:26:10] <%Bt_Robot> Before hitting the blazon, check the map
[2:26:23] <%DakotaMacDoodle> there really using that sony/Spiderman money

[2:26:33] <%Monkeyweed21> psaBlind lol
[2:26:36] <flame_of_udun_> YOUNGLINGD
[2:26:36] <Dunmarkh> use the pixelizer
[2:26:38] <SaltyAzteca> Pixelizer!
[2:26:39] <crassplay_> It's almost like the reason people come back to Ratchet and Clank isn't for new gameplay, but new story and familiar characters
[2:26:40] <flame_of_udun_> YOUNGLINGS
[2:26:42] <hakumaribo> yo the pixelator made it in?
[2:26:42] <%Skelefellah> The game's built so you run out of ammo on things you use too frequently
[2:26:43] <%RyTYoung> oh yeah the different dimensions have different raritarium to collect
[2:26:49] <%TheWinged7> ammo behind ya pat
[2:26:51] <%TheWinged7> aaand too lat
[2:26:57] <entransta> God... Ratchet and Clank I love you. Thank you for damage numbers.
[2:27:07] <xhodocto385> Ratchet just wants his family back BibleThump
[2:27:09] <coreybom> @bakkatohri Hey, whats wrong with buying porn for a 8 year old, and having some kids meet a dominatrix? It‚Äôs all good SeemsGood
[2:27:12] <andrewofbob> The puzzles are the new gameplay breaking up the familiar genre
[2:27:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> IT'S NEVER THEIR FAULT PAT
[2:27:15] <s1rcuit> didn't Clank and Rivet destroy that one?
[2:27:16] <%twistedj3ster> Pat has a point
[2:27:16] <+vaderxyz1970> well it was ratchets fault
[2:27:17] <+SocialMisfitGamer> @hakumaribo He got in the beginning of the game as a pre-order bonus but he never touched it since
[2:27:18] <%Bt_Robot> PAT MISS BIG COLLECTIBLE
[2:27:20] <HarshNerf> man a new dead space with this lightning tech would be the shit
[2:27:21] <SaltyAzteca> The button had a skull and crossbones!
[2:27:30] <%MajorCrasher> to be fair dr nefarious broke that one @patstaresat
[2:27:30] <andrewofbob> Throw wrench
[2:27:32] <penitentpendant> @entransta TBF, it's an optional addon that comes from gold bolts
[2:27:41] <crassplay_> Even if this game had all the same weapons as the other games, it would still be a great game because of the likeable characters and story. Saying it is the same game is like saying all movies are the same movie because they were all filmed with cameras
[2:27:42] <%Skelefellah> Toss the wrench, boss!
[2:27:44] <%washicka> I'm playing FFX on switch right now and hearing Tidus's voice coming from two sources is weirding me out
[2:27:47] <s1rcuit> use the starter gun
[2:27:48] <%Torus1025> Use the blast pistol
[2:27:49] <+MosesUnspoken> you can shoot them
[2:28:00] <hakumaribo> wait hes ignoring the best gun in the franchise? im sad
[2:28:00] <xhodocto385> i just love the different weapons in the series
[2:28:08] <T_Sasquatch> i started deaps space 1 a while back ... its been so long that i dont think i have it in me to play it
[2:28:11] <%Dementedpenguin> Guys, every Metal Slug after the first was a mistake. They were all the same. Kappa
[2:28:19] <entransta> @penitentpendant At least it's an option! Most games just ignore damage numbers even though they're the raddest shit.
[2:28:27] <xhodocto385> if you fall here you collapse into nothingness WutFace
[2:28:37] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt are you ignoring all ammo boxes on purpose?
[2:28:47] <Dunmarkh> communism
[2:28:54] <penitentpendant> Wow, now THERE'S a reference
[2:28:55] <+reknownblackcat> man i watched a streamer play this game literally running through the whole thing. didn't explore one side area. drove me nuts

[2:35:00] <flame_of_udun_> @xhodocto385 nice
[2:35:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> So guys let's talk about how much Pat smell Kappa
[2:35:09] <BigFingerRo> In the meantime, guys, crunchy pizza dough, do you guys like it?
[2:35:10] <Profmcstevie> the small orb man and the lupus lady made of mash potato got a english bulldog, it's like God really does have a sense of humour
[2:35:11] <flame_of_udun_> @coreybom yeah that sounds familiar
[2:35:17] <s1rcuit> @PeachSaliva no worries, the back's main function is to cause pain
[2:35:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> he is not here to defend himself
[2:35:23] <T_Sasquatch> pat hit the back and her back has never been the same
[2:35:30] <%twistedj3ster> @vaultzombie The song is still on youtube, Bootloop by fing3rs I believe
[2:35:39] <xhodocto385> that certain song is mic drop
[2:35:44] <Kghaleon> @sonofthedeepsouth Pat definitely ran from that debate request.
[2:35:51] <s1rcuit> @T_Sasquatch and now they have to be married
[2:36:14] <lonosis47> Is pat going to debate jaffe
[2:36:15] <BigFingerRo> @Kghaleon Pat's IQ must not be as big if he won't take any chance to debate
[2:36:18] <%GalacticaPhanto> @kghaleon You don't have to debate people to make a point
[2:36:27] <xhodocto385> who is Jaffe????
[2:36:28] <BigFingerRo> @lonosis47 lol no
[2:36:32] <T_Sasquatch> @Kghaleon ran ? he was being baited to host some dumbass on his OWN podcast
[2:36:49] <+vaultzombie> @twistedj3ster oh cool, thanks fam üëç
[2:36:57] <Kghaleon> Dude offered to come on the podcast too so we could've got woolie's opinion too
[2:37:04] <Syrushmx> some guy who works on twisted metal and the original god of war i think
[2:37:12] <lonosis47> Huh. Figured pat knew how to debate
[2:37:13] <Profmcstevie> every refusal to some morons request isn't running, get that playground bullshit outta here
[2:37:16] <%twistedj3ster> @vaultzombie np homie
[2:37:21] <VentWilsn> its so great that Pat is playing other games than Mass Effect
[2:37:22] <%DianaTheAscian> Nobody wants to look at Jaffe
[2:37:22] <+RedQueensAce> RELOAD
[2:37:23] <BigFingerRo> @Kghaleon And as we all know, woolie LOVES him some crunch!
[2:37:28] <VentWilsn> i need time to watch all the VODS
[2:37:29] <%GalacticaPhanto> @kghaleon you're also inviting a mess and I bet you money Woolie would've said fuck no to that
[2:37:40] <Kghaleon> Woolie's got some hard takes that would've been fun
[2:37:44] <T_Sasquatch> it is so unwise to host and popularize a man for no reason
[2:37:50] <Doomstar16> This song is pretty catchy.
[2:38:01] <T_Sasquatch> especially one with such a dumb take
[2:38:02] <Podakdrank> mr pat
[2:38:02] <Saltmeisterr> ok chat what the fuck did i come back too
[2:38:08] <lonosis47> @Profmcstevie Moron??? jaffe had some bad takes but hes always been respectful and made some good games
[2:38:10] <+vaultzombie> @T_Sasquatch Seder literally has 1 million followers, dude already has a platform
[2:38:22] <Kghaleon> @Saltmeisterr drama all the time
[2:38:28] <%DianaTheAscian> you came back to the intermission
[2:38:31] <Dunmarkh> @Saltmeisterr one guy
[2:38:32] <GatchaGreed> while it wouldve been fun to watch woolie and pat both dunk on the man live, it would not have been worth the headache
[2:38:48] <T_Sasquatch> @vaultzombie who the hell is seder ?
[2:38:54] <BigFingerRo> @lonosis47 allow me to refer to the moment not a couple hrs ago where he said Pat has left nothing good on earth, while he has made millions happy
[2:38:59] <lonosis47> yeah we couldve had jaffe on castle super beasts
[2:39:09] <+vaultzombie> @T_Sasquatch I think I'm getting podcast drama mixed up, my bad
[2:39:19] <Kghaleon> @GatchaGreed Not debating him is letting him get away with a bad opinion though could've proved him wrong live in front of a thousand people
[2:39:22] <T_Sasquatch> you guys remember DRAWN TO DEATH LUL
[2:39:23] <%LeiaSkynoober> @vaultzombie They're not talking about the Crowder stuff, check Pat's twitter
[2:39:24] <BigFingerRo> so the man's not vert respectful
[2:39:28] <%GalacticaPhanto> This isn't the first time Jaffe was mentioned in relation to CSB and the like
[2:39:29] <Saltmeisterr> @Kghaleon shut up one guy
[2:39:43] <lonosis47> @BigFingerRo Jaffe didnt say that liar dont put words in other ppls mouths
[2:40:06] <BigFingerRo> @lonosis47 would you like a link?
[2:40:11] <+Deathsaw> @Kghaleon jaffe just did a 2 and a half hour show, majority callins. he is finding a debate out there
[2:40:12] <seniormeatbox> haha get fucked jaffe
[2:40:12] <+vaultzombie> @LeiaSkynoober gotcha, I just assumed lmao
[2:40:16] <jamsbybetty> @Kghaleon sbfpRichard sbfpRichard sbfpRichard sbfpRichard sbfpRichard sbfpRichard sbfpRichard sbfpRichard sbfpRichard
[2:40:18] <Syrushmx> well, then how did he say it?
[2:40:18] <%Dementedpenguin> So are yall gonna continue this discussion when Pat comes back? Kappa
[2:40:29] <lonosis47> @BigFingerRo too late. youve already been blocked. :)
[2:40:35] <%GalacticaPhanto> @lonosis47 Jaffe told me that my macaroni family is bad
[2:40:41] <bakkatohri> Having Jaffe on CSB would probably be boring. Like what would they talk about that they haven't already talked about before in the past?
[2:40:46] <seniormeatbox> get fucked
[2:41:00] <bakkatohri> Like Industry type stuff.
[2:41:03] <%twistedj3ster> this conversation is devolving into an unproductive area of discussion. Let's bring back lombussy
[2:41:10] <Robot_Nixon_> REJECT DRAMA moon2SPIN ONLY CUM moon2SPIN
[2:41:12] <flame_of_udun_> No
[2:41:13] <%Skelefellah> I don't get why it's all being discussed at each other like it's something up for debate.
[2:41:18] <Kghaleon> is the new Ratchet actually good outside the pretty graphics?
[2:41:26] <BigFingerRo> @lonosis47 curses!
[2:41:27] <bakkatohri> Lombussy is only coveted by furries
[2:41:29] <flame_of_udun_> Yes
[2:41:30] <Dunmarkh> anybody know any good lombussy artists?
[2:41:31] <%Skelefellah> Let alone at all - it happened, yes, but it's passed.
[2:41:33] <xhodocto385> yes kgha
[2:41:48] <+chester804> is pat taking a dump or is the dog?
[2:41:56] <flame_of_udun_> Both
[2:41:57] <%DianaTheAscian> Yes
[2:41:57] <%Skelefellah> Yes.
[2:42:04] <Dunmarkh> @chester804 dog walk
[2:42:06] <%Dementedpenguin> @chester804 walk dog, feed dog
[2:42:16] <%Dementedpenguin> I think
[2:42:16] <lonosis47> jaffe believes crunch is a necessary part of making games and has actual insight to back it up. not saying i agree but its disappointing that pat and woolie are too scared to debate it @bakkatohri
[2:42:25] <%Dementedpenguin> or one or those two
[2:42:25] <flame_of_udun_> Who made this brb btw
[2:42:40] <Profmcstevie> Lonosis stop being cringe here AND on the podcast chat, good god
[2:42:42] <Dunmarkh> @flame_of_udun_ quiet viking
[2:42:45] <Kghaleon> is there a way to watch Pat's star treks streams or are those gone forever?
[2:42:48] <flame_of_udun_> Nice
[2:42:54] <bakkatohri> @lonosis47 He really doesn't. He hasn't made a good game in 20 years. The last game he worked on was a complete flop.
[2:42:59] <%GalacticaPhanto> @lonosis47 You don't have to entertain bad takes and then give them a platform like bruh stop
[2:43:00] <flame_of_udun_> Star Trek streams??
[2:43:04] <%Skelefellah> Look, I can't speak for the other teammates, but my experience workin' on the title didn't lead to crunch save for one moment, which was my own making.
[2:43:15] <Dunmarkh> @Kghaleon there's an archive somewhere, search the subreddit
[2:43:23] <%KombatxKarlx18> Is this about all that crap I saw on twitter today at work?
[2:43:28] <Kghaleon> @GalacticaPhanto You kinda do, when you get called out live.
[2:43:29] <robotoken> I came for ratchet and clank and I get this instead
[2:43:30] <%YakumoYomi> The Picarto ones he and Paige did with Plague?
[2:43:41] <+vaultzombie> Oldheads in vg development are so attached to the idea of crunch that they can't imagine their careers without it
[2:43:43] <%Skelefellah> The work from home situation did help with production, though, when it came to not applying crunch. It was a nice change of pace, too, since many of the team had families.
[2:43:47] <flame_of_udun_> @robotoken it‚Äôs a brb dude he‚Äôll be back
[2:43:55] <%Skelefellah> I can't speak for thme, but I never had much issue during production.
[2:43:58] <lonosis47> You're legit talking about censorship. if its such a bad take why is it so hard for pat to disprove it? @GalacticaPhanto
[2:44:04] <Robot_Nixon_> moon2PAIN
[2:44:28] <%GarbageNirvana> Are people being tools in here
[2:44:31] <lonosis47> FYI i AGREE ITS A BAD TAKE. I want Pat to destroy jaffe on his opinion
[2:44:45] <Profmcstevie> Then go destroy him yourself bro
[2:44:48] <flame_of_udun_> @garbagenirvana no just talking about crunch like always
[2:44:49] <%GalacticaPhanto> @lonosis47 Because it won't go anywhere. Pat is known to fuel the fire and Jaffe is the kind of dude who will immediately take it and it'll be a mess
[2:44:56] <%DianaTheAscian> the bit has passed already
[2:44:59] <%Skelefellah> Don't get someone to go fight battles you wanna fight
[2:45:14] <+chester804> this guy Pat dumpstered on twitter today I've never heard of previously and would like to keep it that way
[2:45:17] <%GalacticaPhanto> And Woolie is the person who'll not even bother with that shit
[2:45:19] <%Dementedpenguin> @GarbageNirvana I'm just curious to see if this coincidentally stops when Pat comes back. Kappa
[2:45:32] <lonosis47> Cause they're both cowards
[2:45:37] <%Skelefellah> @Dementedpenguin Calling it now, it most likely will drop dead.
[2:45:47] <+Melhazred> This seems like a wild first stream to come into. and weird timing
[2:45:50] <Kghaleon> @Dementedpenguin Obviously, you think pat won't just ban everyone that talks about it?
[2:45:51] <Robot_Nixon_> any mods? moon2SUFFER
[2:46:01] <%Taisuru> Pat dead?
[2:46:09] <seniormeatbox> pats taking a big dump
[2:46:11] <%ScottishMadJacko> @lonosis47 why should they waste time debating this asshole with his shit takes
[2:46:12] <Saltmeisterr> jesus christ man
[2:46:13] <%Dementedpenguin> @Kghaleon Dude what?
[2:46:13] <%Skelefellah> Doggo walk
[2:46:14] <+CoPowah> super ded
[2:46:16] <Robot_Nixon_> please end my suffering
[2:46:19] <seniormeatbox> but not as big as the dump he took on david
[2:46:21] <%DianaTheAscian> dog walk
[2:46:26] <%JamesCorck> I turn around for one hour, is everything ok?
[2:46:32] <s1rcuit> so I just read the twitter argument Pat had with Jaffe, and I say well done
[2:46:42] <+Melhazred> What are some good things to know for a newcomer to Pat staring at things?
[2:46:48] <bakkatohri> HEY ANYBODY REMEMBER "DRAWN TO DEATH"? NO? OKAY.
[2:46:52] <lonosis47> Since when did shit takes become unwelcome on the podcast or anywhere? it creates a discussion and thats kinda the whole point of a podcast. DISCUSSINg. @ScottishMadJacko
[2:46:58] <+chester804> he stares at things
[2:47:02] <%GalacticaPhanto> The moral of the story is crunch in any form is bad, and defending it isn't a debate. simple idea yeah?
[2:47:04] <+CoPowah> you have to stare at Pat who is staring at things
[2:47:15] <s1rcuit> at least I think I did, not sure where the charity part came from
[2:47:15] <+Melhazred> @CoPowah I love it
[2:47:16] <%ScottishMadJacko> @melhazred expect chaos especially when paige or the animals are around
[2:47:17] <%Dementedpenguin> Not long
[2:47:20] <cnry_m> The dog makes cameo appearances
[2:47:20] <flame_of_udun_> @bakkatohri what platform was it even on again
[2:47:23] <akitanito> that was... 10 years

[2:50:41] <%putnampuppeteer> at the lips
[2:50:41] <cnry_m> Who‚Äôs Jaffe?
[2:50:42] <Uselesswhitenoise> when you think about you two are the same person, like jekle and hyde
[2:50:43] <+black_pariah> he said not giving him a platform was censorship or some shit
[2:50:48] <akitanito> tips touching
[2:50:48] <%putnampuppeteer> just constant smooches
[2:50:48] <bakkatohri> @lonosis47 Pat and Woolie both don't like crunch...

[2:50:55] <Broken_Sonex> Who's saying shit/ Gimme the name i just wanna talk to them
[2:51:00] <%justcallmebobplease> I suppose I can see a self avowed villain supporting crunch and it not being crazy sounding...
[2:51:03] <%MelBrooksKA> I can't believe Woolie eats raw meat and won't debate David Jackass
[2:51:05] <akitanito> that's the same argument that climate deniers use
[2:51:05] <penitentpendant> They are two flavors of crazy, great together but still different
[2:51:08] <+CoPowah> can confirm crunch sucks
[2:51:10] <%ape_hawk> @dan_g_v a miserable pile of crunch
[2:51:13] <%ScottishMadJacko> @lonosis47 claimed you were censoring jaffie

[2:51:34] <%ospreyworks> Jaffe n. a crunch apologist, a debate bro, some guy who made games once
[2:51:35] <T_Sasquatch> I am right and you are wrong :)

[2:52:04] <%RyTYoung> 30*

[2:55:23] <+jordanlondergan> Everything in the universe is fake, we're all a figment of Zangief's imagination
[2:55:26] <%RyTYoung> Get a Skye Terrier they're Greyfriar Bobbies so who wouldn't want one?
[2:55:26] <%putnampuppeteer> @YakumoYomi It means "A little bit." It comes from a Japanese word. "Sukoshi" or something

[2:55:48] <%ssjklyco> its really hard to argue crunch is good when you see Cyberpunk release and it's such a mess that the current gen versions are being delayed a whole year
[2:55:52] <ScreamLord> HappiestPat
[2:55:56] <%TacoSaIad> french bulldogs are cute too yeah.
[2:55:57] <bakkatohri> @TurtlesAndTentacles It's probably more moral to adopt, because there are a lot of animals that need love
[2:55:57] <%BubbaRands> dog give the feel good brain chemicals
[2:56:01] <%ape_hawk> its only 3 door, ratchet
[2:56:04] <PineapplePlatypus> You say that, but no matter what you get next if anything. You'll love that slob goblin just as much.
[2:56:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> Alien Ieolation time
[2:56:07] <bakkatohri> Also, puppies have the risk of being from a puppy mill.
[2:56:19] <%GalacticaPhanto> rescue if you can, if not a trusted breeder
[2:56:20] <%YakumoYomi> @putnampuppeteer Thanks for the explanation.
[2:56:22] <@PeachSaliva> @bakkatohri that's why you do research on where to get an animal from.

[2:56:40] <%Taisuru> I prefer puppies from homes of actual people
[2:56:41] <bakkatohri> @PeachSaliva Yeah, definitely.

[2:58:57] <akitanito> big smart
[2:58:59] <BigFingerRo> we looked for his owner for a good week, but no one responded, the vet says he might've gotten kicked out, as he had been homeless for like 2 or 3 months
[2:59:02] <californaya> @SaiyanShoto French bulldogs are generally smaller
[2:59:18] <%ScottishMadJacko> frenchies are tiny
[2:59:20] <bakkatohri> @ScreamLord Metroid has always been kinda spooky. But 2D is never scary.
[2:59:26] <%SaiyanShoto> ohhh ok got it!
[2:59:34] <%Alazull> They're doing a good job of setting a mood of spook in this
[2:59:37] <californaya> I had an ex that was obsessed with French bulldogs, I know way too much about them

[3:01:02] <Saltmeisterr> oh no the poor fish
[3:01:02] <californaya> @ape_hawk it really depends on the individual dog. I had an Australian shepherd mix that was extremely dog aggressive.
[3:01:03] <bakkatohri> Like that Super Metroid had a lot of dead bodies in that intro sequence, didn't it.

[3:01:13] <%AzureGale> TRY WALKING THROUGH THE WINDOW
[3:01:14] <xhodocto385> even the nes Metroid has a bit of horror, some of the music
[3:01:18] <penitentpendant> @AzureGale At least for the swift yet inevitable betrayal, by the looks of the tropes
[3:01:35] <%GalacticaPhanto> @bakkatohri I forgot the beginning had you run past bodies holy shit
[3:01:35] <%Cykron> Socializing your puppy is EXTREMELY important
[3:02:27] <bakkatohri> @GalacticaPhanto Yeah, Metroid has always been spooky.
[3:02:29] <californaya> these puzzles are dope
[3:02:32] <flame_of_udun_> Cool lil puzzle
[3:02:45] <%GarbageNirvana> So I know it's largely a gimmick but that rift thing is still cool as hell
[3:02:51] <ScreamLord> Did Pat forget about the rocket dash?
[3:02:59] <%Cykron> Man I miss Metroid Prime
[3:03:04] <%AzureGale> Die-mensions
[3:03:14] <flame_of_udun_> It‚Äôs not really a gimmick when you use it substantially during gameplay @garbagenirvana
[3:03:19] <penitentpendant> Praise the callbacks!
[3:03:22] <flame_of_udun_> Especially combat
[3:03:25] <+tigerfang86> I understood that reference!!!
[3:03:27] <%GarbageNirvana> @flame_of_udun_ True
[3:03:29] <californaya> God, I wish The Medium ran this well, I loved its dual world gimmick
[3:03:29] <SaltyAzteca> We Metroid now
[3:03:29] <%AzureGale> Is that the same O2 mask he got in the first game
[3:03:34] <+tigerfang86> its cause he got the O2 filter all the way back in the first game!!!!
[3:03:37] <StarMechV> haha it's funny cause there hasnt been a underwater section in a ratchet game since the first ps3
[3:03:38] <%twistedj3ster> It's like that KOTOR planety
[3:03:38] <%GarbageNirvana> How much you wanna bet the final boss is gonna have you jumping back and forth between them constantly

[3:05:26] <Broken_Sonex> I can explain it: Shut up, it's a fucking game
[3:05:28] <%psidefx> every gun has a TINY veil of air around it to fire
[3:05:35] <flame_of_udun_> @scarman125 NO
[3:05:36] <xhodocto385> cant swim LUL
[3:05:36] <HawkHollywood> Fiya in the wataah
[3:05:36] <%Cykron> Some guns can be fired under water tho
[3:05:38] <flame_of_udun_> THERES NO TIME
[3:05:39] <%AzureGale> Oh, Ratchet and Rivet inexplicably sharing everything is fine. but weapons firing in water is where you draw the line :p
[3:06:01] <Dunmarkh> @Cykron electrical weapons tho
[3:06:08] <%Skelefellah> @AzureGale Didn't they use Ms Zurkon near the beginning to explain the shared stuff, saying they share an account?
[3:06:11] <Profmcstevie> We at least have a joint account with Zurkon for weapons
[3:06:15] <BigFingerRo> @AzureGale they're fb friends or some shit like that, we were told this
[3:06:26] <flame_of_udun_> The magneboot jumps look satisfying
[3:06:39] <%Skelefellah> Gotta wrench em, Pat

[3:07:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> Good Mom
[3:07:50] <jorniev> EXISTENTIAL ECONOMICS?
[3:07:52] <%AzureGale> @AzureGale That explains the bolts, at least
[3:07:52] <%Cykron> Sounds like money well spent
[3:07:52] <MildMannered_Creighton> GOOD MOM
[3:07:55] <StarMechV> Ms. Zurkon is such a good Mom
[3:07:55] <flame_of_udun_> WARMONGER is a strong name
[3:07:59] <TurtlesAndTentacles> VANESSA IN KING OF FGHTERS 14!!!
[3:08:01] <%Skelefellah> Those are some pretty strong Doom Bots
[3:08:06] <flame_of_udun_> Wow she is an amazing mom
[3:08:18] <%Cykron> I majored in Underwater Basket Weaving
[3:08:21] <+polothegreatest> ramon next then
[3:08:23] <%justcallmebobplease> Whenever I'm not watching the stream and just listening, I keep hearing FFX Tidus talking and wondering when the old LP started auto-playing. It's surreal.
[3:08:32] <%toolofparanoia> Putting your kids through college that's a good mom
[3:08:33] <s1rcuit> since they're moving back and forth between Ratchet and Rivet's dimensions shouldn't they be swapping out between Ms. and Mrs. Zurkon?
[3:08:34] <PineapplePlatypus> It stun locks ads
[3:08:38] <%ScottishMadJacko> stun for longer
[3:08:40] <%Kitafin> upgrade it and find out
[3:08:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> Its powered by memes
[3:08:43] <%ape_hawk> does the sprinkler work underwater?
[3:08:44] <pi_in_the_sci> It stunlocks crowds
[3:08:44] <Profmcstevie> It gets....features
[3:08:45] <%ScottishMadJacko> and damage multiplier
[3:08:52] <Thepothero> Mr s Zurkon is cool and all but i miss Zurkon SR
[3:09:04] <%SolidusRex> It stuns enemies
[3:09:07] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Set and forget I imagine
[3:09:07] <NickHatesSnow> it stuns and weakens
[3:09:13] <%ScottishMadJacko> you have a shit ton of raritanium
[3:09:15] <Profmcstevie> A long lasting lockdown
[3:09:17] <TurtlesAndTentacles> It puts overgrowth over enemies including bosses. Holds them in place for you to shoot with other gun. Allows you to not get hit when low on health
[3:09:19] <%GalacticaPhanto> @thepothero He runs the bar and Jr runs the arena
[3:09:24] <flame_of_udun_> @s1rcuit it‚Äôs not his dimension they‚Äôre going to
[3:09:29] <BigFingerRo> It's a P for PAT
[3:09:34] <%DianaTheAscian> extending its active time would be good
[3:09:49] <%twistedj3ster> y get no ammo
[3:09:51] <s1rcuit> @flame_of_udun_ ok, been getting some of the plot mixed up
[3:09:52] <%Skelefellah> Fun Dev Fact: That weapon caused a lotta trouble when testing since when it was fully upgraded its multiplier made it almost insta-kill bosses... As you'd imagine, that got tuned.
[3:09:59] <Thepothero> @GalacticaPhanto Yeha least they didnt leave the guy out
[3:10:07] <flame_of_udun_> @s1rcuit don‚Äôt blame you lol
[3:10:16] <laguerrilha> Wow so much dialogue
[3:10:21] <+featherlan> "Homicidally disgusted" I love that one
[3:10:23] <penitentpendant> Praise the froze topiaries!
[3:10:33] <s1rcuit> @flame_of_udun_ like I don't even know if this takes place pre or post retconn
[3:10:35] <flame_of_udun_> Yup they have dialogue for every weapon you use
[3:10:42] <flame_of_udun_> They even point out the names
[3:10:46] <+gregpivo> Just dropped in to say, holy shit David Jaffe has lost his damn mind
[3:10:48] <%ScottishMadJacko> frozen and plantified
[3:10:49] <xhodocto385> the word homicide is in this kids game Kappa
[3:10:58] <laguerrilha> I like it, Its like Fallen Order where every trooper group had unique dialogue
[3:11:03] <%ScottishMadJacko> war crimes are being committed
[3:11:06] <flame_of_udun_> @s1rcuit this is not the reboot timeline
[3:11:15] <%ScottishMadJacko> it poisons now
[3:11:19] <Profmcstevie> TOXIARY
[3:11:21] <s1rcuit> @flame_of_udun_ thank god
[3:11:22] <%cvp5127> poison
[3:11:26] <%QueequegTheater> Poison oison oison
[3:11:28] <pi_in_the_sci> They drop health when you kill them
[3:11:32] <xhodocto385> its not war crimes if we are killing nefarious minions
[3:11:38] <%Faustgesicht> Actual Nightmare
[3:11:52] <s1rcuit> @flame_of_udun_ the reboot was a mistake
[3:11:53] <%QueequegTheater> War crimes only count if you lose
[3:11:55] <laguerrilha> Those sentries had families D:
[3:12:03] <flame_of_udun_> Poison Ivy gun
[3:12:05] <%sjay662> yo, this is some Annihilation shit
[3:12:07] <%twistedj3ster> Pat please just go buy some ammo
[3:12:12] <xhodocto385> that gun can use a grass-type attack PogChamp pokemon
[3:12:16] <%QueequegTheater> @laguerrilha yeah we should kill them too
[3:12:19] <NickHatesSnow> until ng
[3:12:23] <%cvp5127> ice gun has an upgrade that increases weapon xp
[3:12:28] <%tank7013> So it's a stun that weakens their defense, gives a resource drop chance, and dots them. Seems pretty good
[3:12:38] <Dova573> why not?
[3:12:42] <%Ascethetic> @twistedj3ster but thats not min maxxing his money Kappa
[3:12:43] <%ScottishMadJacko> @queequegtheater out for blood, or oil today

[3:23:00] <%ScottishMadJacko> other dimension probs
[3:23:05] <s1rcuit> this is such a leap forward compared to the last Ratchet game
[3:23:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Go back to snow dimension and "jet over"
[3:23:20] <%GalacticaPhanto> Wasfhr
[3:23:22] <%ScottishMadJacko> I missed so may bolts

[3:23:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and don't miss the teddy bear this time
[3:23:38] <%Monkeyweed21> @s1rcuit the last good Ratchet was on the PS3 of course it is
[3:23:55] <flame_of_udun_> @galacticaphanto gameplay wise yes, narrative wise? Fuck no
[3:23:55] <+ScrapKingKeita> @GalacticaPhanto had a few decent guns, but no, it dragged on really hard
[3:24:04] <flame_of_udun_> Because it was a movie tie in
[3:24:11] <%Skelefellah> Nice work
[3:24:11] <%ScottishMadJacko> @galacticaphanto I thought it played well, story was pretty simple and standard
[3:24:14] <%putnampuppeteer> yooo
[3:24:15] <s1rcuit> @Monkeyweed21 yeah, but latest doesn't mean greatest, look at the PS4 one
[3:24:16] <xhodocto385> flame of udun then why watch this Kappa
[3:24:18] <scarman125> I'm still confused why the same facility exists in 2 different dimensions in seemingly different points during it's existence.
[3:24:21] <%RyTYoung> I platinumed this game, and I'm pretty close to 100% the full game, just got to upgrade all the guns
