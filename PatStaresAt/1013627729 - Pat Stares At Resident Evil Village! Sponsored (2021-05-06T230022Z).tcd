[0:22:35] <skyentombment> how do tall guy find tall girl?
[0:22:35] <%RetroCop87> Being short is fine. Having less blood flow puts reduced strain on your heart, pretty much making you a biological panacea

[0:25:52] <%strakillias> Plague beat them to the bugs punch with that one animation. Thats why bug ladies aren't popular

[0:25:56] <johnatella> broke: mommy milkers. woke: bug infested goth girls??
[0:25:56] <%Pookiedaexzile> Small Blonde Daughters aint Cheeked up like Lady D
[0:25:56] <+Vigonept> AND they ruin the nature
[0:25:57] <%sporeian94> I got a whole bitcoin keep wehining pat I'm gonna be rich
[0:25:59] <+Kyma1020> Probably because Big Lady is different and everybody's been super horny due to COVID
[0:26:01] <%Axellogic> I live with a crypto miner it sucks
[0:26:01] <%Albadabar> My prediction: Once the game gets in more peoples' hands we'll see a lot less Big Vampire Mommy and a lot more Grizzled Werewolf Daddy on the timeline
[0:26:03] <@PeachSaliva> What if Lady D put you in her butt man that would be crazy
[0:26:03] <GravyLangley> you see that archetype with the goth daughters in vampire stuff alot, big tall dommy vampire mommy is more rare
[0:26:03] <%UnabashedGarbage> I've been watching the tracker for months and still haven't managed to grab one.
[0:26:05] <$sarah_galb> Cant wait to get to Milf Mansion

[1:18:54] <Thepothero> man thoose branch snaps sound great
[1:18:54] <%Valdorick> He's also played too many of these games.
[1:18:54] <Calamity2007> Ethan is in protag mode now
[1:18:55] <penitentpendant> Ethan: "This again? Really?"
[1:18:57] <Teras_ode> he's used to it

[1:19:18] <mannywatcha> Ethan trained himself ot stay silent and not attract attention
[1:19:18] <+SundanceShot> it's appropriate for ethan to have the most gormless response
[1:19:19] <+Caridinn> "H-Hewwo?"
[1:19:20] <%RedMageRebel> I imagine when you survive one bio incident it becomes old hat

[1:36:17] <%walternatorz> just increase your FPS, the normal tactical move
[1:36:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Use a med kit to heal it
[1:36:18] <fritz_dacat> how many times has he lost a finger
[1:36:18] <penitentpendant> I wonder if this is a soft way to setup dynamic difficulty
[1:36:19] <%patriotrenegade> should probably do something about your fingers
[1:36:19] <%BoxNavy> good thing you have a mold
[1:36:20] <MyNameIsRasus> how is he not bleeding like a maniac
[1:36:20] <+NateyBeak> thats alot of hand just gone
[1:36:20] <%ChanseyChild> As someone from the medical field, this guy should have zero feeling from the elbows down
[1:36:21] <+chiazam> ITS DED
[1:36:21] <%logoth_> He'd still be in horrible pain right now
[1:36:21] <ape_hawk> "NOT AGAIN!"

[1:36:22] <Brother_Coduss> ALWAYS LEFTY
[1:36:22] <+jing_da> probs normal

[1:36:24] <%ConLin_Arts_> Ethan has a rough day
[1:36:24] <dukenux> always with the hand trauma
[1:36:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just use a medkit to make it magically reattach
[1:36:25] <missingangle> I saw someone use 7 a while ago. Dunno how much of it depends on shots.
[1:36:26] <%strugglepunk2> !time
[1:36:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the fingers are the character, you see
[1:36:27] <+JaseAdrift> and you can't get those finger back now
[1:36:28] <%0rond> is this the same arm they stapled together in RE7?
[1:36:29] <%BubbaRands> Stab him again just to be sure

[1:36:33] <+ALazo> it ate them, though. Can you grow them back?
[1:36:35] <+thegreenbenis> Probably put something on that.
[1:36:35] <+evbites> @titansloth93 he had a chopped of hand already
[1:36:37] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I don't think Ethan's gonna get those fingers back this time

[1:38:25] <%Deft_Thought> You mean outside of cutscenes

[1:38:26] <%herecomesmong0> SOme kind of other item
[1:38:26] <%josstil> TRUE
[1:38:27] <Tisaric> Ethan's just built different
[1:38:28] <%walternatorz> Ethan is the RE punching bag
[1:38:28] <penitentpendant> That's honestly probably why they sent Ethan in, instead of Chris. Contractual immunity.
[1:38:29] <casualbaloth> they sure can
[1:38:29] <TurranosOrn> but all you get is 'I heal good'
[1:38:30] <+Delenay> where did the wolfman throw him out off. he was pulled down, pulled to the side then tossed right through the wall

[1:38:41] <%Raikouija> bolt cutters
[1:38:42] <FirewallStorm> Nano mold son
[1:38:42] <%AllenDeadman> Ethan is by far the protagonist that has received the worst injuries

[1:38:58] <+Vigonept> ethan the real hero
[1:38:59] <dukenux> Ethan's superpower is tanking it
[1:39:02] <Khorneflakes_> The sound design, as always, has been on point
[1:39:03] <%Blackleafx> colt butters
[1:39:06] <+silentblast93> pat shouldnt you bandage that hand?
[1:39:09] <+chiazam> Bolt Cutters, where would we be without them
[1:39:09] <MyNameIsRasus> Ethan is just Mr Burns
[1:39:09] <perpetualpotionmachine> Ethan's secret anatomy dummy technique
[1:39:09] <%BoxNavy> moldthan
[1:39:10] <+TensecondTarvis> The map even tells you when building are cleared it looks like
[1:39:10] <%PhantomMiG> Is the wolfman body still there?
[1:39:12] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Ethan's the only RE Protagonist that has been bitten in canon but didn't turn.
[1:39:13] <%Frost_Quill> Well I don't need these SUPER HELPFUL BOLT CUTTERS anymore.  Better throw them away.
[1:39:14] <%jamox1> Wait the house turned blue on the map
[1:39:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> Of course not
[1:39:16] <JeoDood> Ethan A TANK BUILD
[1:39:16] <Ianrazz> Man that fingers gettin bitten shit got to me
[1:39:16] <%josstil> ARROWS?
[1:39:17] <%jamox1> Why?
[1:39:19] <%Raikouija> those are some shitty bolt cutters
[1:39:19] <+unremarkableprodigy> You just inherited the mold i was molded by it
[1:39:20] <%Deft_Thought> What, does he eat t he bolt cutters?
[1:39:22] <mannywatcha> Where did ethan get a tache case?
[1:39:23] <+silentblast93> like before you bleed out
[1:39:24] <hydragoon513> So mats and key items aren't part of the inventory anymore?
[1:39:25] <%legendscar01> Ethan is like Atreus, filling in diary
[1:39:26] <dukenux> Ethan took ALL vaccines at once
[1:39:26] <%herecomesmong0> thank god
[1:39:29] <spawnzie> that's nice
[1:39:29] <dinnydanny777> Oh yeah he did just get bit
[1:39:30] <jamsbybetty> Bolt Cutters would arguably make a much better weapon than that knife lol
[1:39:31] <sharpened_hammer> Map-chan is kind and sweet
[1:39:36] <Scamsy> i love smart maps
[1:39:37] <dinnydanny777> Lycan throbby
[1:39:37] <casualbaloth> oh hey, what a coincident
[1:39:38] <%SeaReally> yes
[1:39:39] <TurranosOrn> wait does this mean Ethan will get to pull dante's and run through swords
[1:39:40] <%Blackleafx> @Deft_Thought good source of iron
[1:39:41] <AbysmalWulf> That water has to be cold as all fuck off.
[1:39:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> What does the game call them?
[1:39:42] <JetpackMcQuack> passive healing OP
[1:39:43] <%NoHopeForMyCuirass> Lichens ShadyLulu
[1:39:43] <+D00msDayDan> i'll never not hear it as lichen
[1:39:45] <MadDesperado13> Correct terminology lol
[1:39:46] <%Cozy90> Call them Korones!
[1:39:47] <%LaughingCatt> i mean they where called that in the trailer so...
[1:39:47] <%legendscar01> Lycan is a more badass name
[1:39:47] <ergulor> and a mobile one
[1:39:48] <penitentpendant> Durable but dumb, good fodder material
[1:39:48] <%baronouroboros> weredog
[1:39:48] <CappuccinoGuil> can't even knock them down and slash them
[1:39:48] <%Deft_Thought> Day-wolves though?
[1:39:48] <%TheWinged7> i wonder if headshots do a tone on them
[1:39:49] <+Fenris_Alexius> either that or the handgun is hot shit
[1:39:50] <ChungusQuest> Warwilfs!
[1:39:51] <xavi_is_here> Lycan  cuz they still look humanoid
[1:39:51] <$dalmek> oh haha, mold and lichens (lycans)
[1:39:51] <%patriotrenegade> call them sabrewulfs
[1:39:52] <Giztech> this is just a Underworld movie now lol
[1:39:52] <Teyaric> They called them lycans in the trailers!
[1:39:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> Lycan
[1:39:52] <%ChanseyChild> Some 20-something guy in my city is wanted for breaking into a Planet Fitness locker with bolt cutters and I just had to laugh because you just KNOW he's a gamer
[1:39:53] <plaguedoctor_syan> maybe slash them a little bit?
[1:39:53] <%ChestMimik> Lycanthropy vs Lichenthropy
[1:39:53] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah they want them to be a problem
[1:39:53] <%crimsonharvest> usually the first enemy in a game doesn't maim you permanently but its resident evil
[1:39:54] <+solarisknight7> I think their offical name IS Lycans
[1:39:54] <+WingBuffet> very much like the RE1 zombie that eats all your bullets
[1:39:55] <%herecomesmong0> Didnt they call they lycans in one of the trailers?
[1:39:55] <%ringabal> Lycans don't burst into goo, for one
[1:39:56] <Teras_ode> like ens
[1:39:56] <+MeatBomb> Ethan is 5G+ enabled.
[1:39:57] <%dave323dave> like hens
[1:39:58] <Deadlydog> what difficulty level is this?
[1:39:58] <%RetroCop87> puts avoidance in your head
[1:39:59] <%Deft_Thought> @Blackleafx He does need to replenish blood
[1:39:59] <jamsbybetty> bolt cutter would cave in a werewolf head no problem
[1:40:00] <tacoisgoods> Better base enemy than the molded
[1:40:00] <%jorniev> lichten
[1:40:00] <xavi_is_here> and not wolf faces
[1:40:01] <spawnzie> maybe we get gun upgrades
[1:40:01] <Gorgs7> No less durable than Mia
[1:40:01] <%BoxNavy> lichen
[1:40:01] <ScreamLord> Aren't they called Lycans in the trailer?
[1:40:01] <radix865> Probably gets easier as you upgrade
[1:40:01] <%templar010> oookay
[1:40:02] <%Raikouija> welp
[1:40:02] <dukenux> call them doggons
[1:40:02] <+Vigonept> silver knife needed
[1:40:04] <Reziart> better get real good with that knife
[1:40:05] <doc_ock_rokc> @TurranosOrn Ethan is DANTE why do you think they don't show the face
[1:40:06] <islandsunn> it'd be harious if it was caused lichens
[1:40:06] <%patriotrenegade> ominous
[1:40:06] <+DBTenno> lycans likin lychees
[1:40:07] <%Pookiedaexzile> Are you afraid
[1:40:07] <%MandMGrease> And they're more like Hunters than zombies.  The standard enemy is a Hunter.
[1:40:07] <+gitgouda> man im jealous i wish i was that desensitized.
[1:40:07] <%Piemen99> OH
[1:40:08] <%AllenDeadman> @0rond what are you talking about? they made 2, one he injected into super mutated jack, and then he chose between mia and zoe, he never used the antidote himself
[1:40:09] <Scamsy> can we summon mold friends
[1:40:10] <%ChanseyChild> OH no the 5G!!!
[1:40:10] <@PeachSaliva> Doggies

[1:45:08] <xavi_is_here> growlies
[1:45:08] <%silentshrub_> F your immersion says Capcom
[1:45:08] <%ChanseyChild> Because America, fuck yeah, greatest country in whole dang world or something like that
[1:45:09] <+chiazam> They might be Americans
[1:45:09] <%dekkitout> They're in Romania, Illinois
[1:45:09] <+DigitalPelican> unless.....
[1:45:09] <%Frost_Quill> Maybe to show they're speaking the local language without an accent?  I don't know.
[1:45:09] <%TheMattman1313> They've been talking in Romanian the while time and this is Ethan internalizing it as American English duh!
[1:45:09] <ShiningAxis> lycanthropy turns you into an american
[1:45:10] <jamsbybetty> It's not an american accent, it's a werewolf accent
[1:45:10] <Tham1k> globalization

[1:55:02] <beeswachs> @Aeoneth They're called Lycans, it's a catchall term for werewolf types
[1:55:11] <insomniac_doze_> craft more fingers

[1:55:16] <%dankgerald> psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:55:17] <Phil_Morg> what if you just had stayed put on the house?
[1:55:18] <Siconia> @nicoleymcquack You think this will stop them from remaking RE4?
[1:55:18] <+DeerestPrince> feels weird as hell to go to Werewolf Clan of Evil protects Big Castle of Sexy Vampires from Zombies from Bad Virus oh no he has. a 20-pack
[1:55:19] <+Vigonept> lycanthrope

[1:55:19] <%walternatorz> can you craft shotgun ammo?
[1:55:23] <CappuccinoGuil> Could you have shot the flour bags?
[1:55:26] <+FlongBongle> Ps4 version is playable
[1:55:27] <%shurtal> attack the flour
[1:55:29] <+ninjabush> break open flower bags
[1:55:30] <+condemned_15> knife the sacks
[1:55:33] <%ejackalope> you forgot to knife flour lol
[1:55:36] <Scamsy> ethan mold fingers when

[1:55:43] <%patriotrenegade> have you tried
[1:55:43] <Calamity2007> Yeah to those who have it how is the PS4 version?
[1:55:44] <%hrbeck_> shooting the flour uses a bullet
[1:55:44] <+Carl_Von_Lucoa> cant open it
[1:55:44] <%genepark> You can craft shotgun ammo. You just unlock the recipe
[1:55:47] <mannywatcha> Ehtan where is your military training. You should ahve learned this.

[1:56:04] <%causewaybob> Box
[1:56:05] <+Fenris_Alexius> @PatStaresAt there's a button prompt to break a box, you don't need to pull out a knife to do it
[1:56:05] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Do you think this will have items really hard to find like RE7 or they toned it down?
[1:56:06] <scrublordsamurai> shits locked!
[1:56:08] <JeoDood> the flour is for running away i guess
[1:56:08] <Dave_VD> Lycan usually implies they can transform at will too
[1:56:11] <+VoytekBus> when a mommy shotgun and a daddy shotgun love each other very much, ammo is produced
[1:56:13] <BeezusHrist> re engine needs more interactive environments
[1:56:17] <BaekTheHeck> thats a lot of ammo i bet theres not gonna be a lot more
[1:56:19] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat It seems lile you will have to do alot of backtracking and pathing like RE2R
[1:56:22] <trianglehat> that's a fancy shotgun

[1:56:33] <%moogleboy1984> "Umm... ackshully Pat, you were supposed to execute."
[1:56:36] <%Aeoneth> @Aeoneth Right,  but normally the term is lycanthrope.  The fact they're only using the shorthand of lycan combined with the Japanese love of puns makes me think it'll probably be a moss or something that started everything
[1:56:37] <islandsunn> crate
[1:56:37] <Spyder1246> hit the barrel with the knife @PatStaresAt
[1:56:38] <+Fill783> barrel prompt?

[1:56:49] <Phil_Morg> like how was that sequence supposed to go if you had stayed inside instead of outside?
[1:56:52] <%DrTomT18> maybe in New Game Plus you can survive that attack
[1:56:53] <+FlongBongle> EYELIDS
[1:56:54] <+Fill783> why the barrel got a prompt?
[1:56:55] <+CourageTheCat> is it just me or are the boxes shaded differently then everything else in the game
[1:56:57] <PanicSwytch> When did ethan wrap his injury?
[1:56:58] <boogaleeboo> I mean dudes drop money and stuff, so killing a bunch of them might have helped, but I doubt it matters too much

[1:59:36] <Lolcola34> they both do the same trick
[1:59:37] <EndlessScrapper> Look Capcom I dont know why you feel you need to add in a new backstory every time you release a new game in a series but geesh
[1:59:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> makes sense, every cult needs its logo
[1:59:37] <%Deft_Thought> Logo of Cult

[1:59:39] <LunarRemix> That's their logo, that's their slogan
[1:59:40] <wasdsf> BIOCULT
[1:59:40] <xavi_is_here> Los Illuminados
[1:59:40] <Srthunda> all logos are for cults
[1:59:40] <sosuke5> The Cult TM
[1:59:40] <%shurtal> Nah, just wacky, mundane cult stuff
[1:59:40] <%MonsterEnvy> It does not look that much like Umbrella to me
[1:59:40] <dinnydanny777> Brand recognition is important for your cult limesOk
[1:59:41] <%Teintstein> Not with RE
[1:59:41] <amymist> i like that about you
[1:59:41] <+Cactuskris> the brand
[1:59:41] <+Fenris_Alexius> the umbrella logo isn't a circle though @PatStaresAt
[1:59:41] <%AJ_Cherenkov> AJ_Cherenkov subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Didn
[1:59:42] <sans86> its the cult branding

[1:59:47] <+evbites> painted with squirrl jizz
[1:59:48] <cardamomo88> plesant
[1:59:48] <%Pookiedaexzile> No Cults are Brands
[1:59:49] <Wafflez1909> the cult logo for the cult merch
[1:59:50] <oneimportantthing> But unlike the demo you don't have to rush
[1:59:50] <KumaTorey> its an animu fighetr sigil
[1:59:52] <%Deft_Thought> Rugs on the wall, always a good look
[1:59:52] <$RealThiele> it worked for scientology
[1:59:52] <$floralkami> I mean, it's branding, so it's literally a logo
[1:59:52] <%hrbeck_> cults do have logos now
[1:59:53] <%templar010> Just cult it on up man
[1:59:53] <%Agami23> i remember when i made jokes about being in a cult
[1:59:53] <Psyramics> Cult Slogan: You don't have to be crazy to be a member, but it helps!

[1:59:55] <Sunstalker> That's basically what brand logos are.
[1:59:56] <%Raikouija> @MyNameIsRasus FUCK you are right
[1:59:56] <Major_Monotone> Cult drip
[1:59:56] <Phil_Morg> like sacrifice childs to the blood god

[1:59:58] <%pyrojack6> Nice Ambience, room for many Cultists
[1:59:58] <%patriotrenegade> like human sacrifices and devil worship!

[2:00:08] <Calamity2007> @KumaTorey The Wheel of Fate is Turning
[2:00:09] <%Uselesswhitenoise> even starting a cult has been subsumed by the trappings of cpaital
[2:00:10] <%TheHappyCynic> how long is this stream gonna go for?

[2:00:14] <BepBepAmShep> Man, that cult logo really brings the cult room together.
[2:00:15] <%s1rcuit> considering most of these cults are fucked up death cults with out a viable plan, no it's not unreasonable to ignore the symbology of it
[2:00:15] <spawnzie> has haptic feedback been doing anything so far?
[2:00:16] <count_bob> If only we had a a master of unlocking.
[2:00:17] <PanicSwytch> Maybe u return

[2:11:22] <+rocko_125> someone is hungry for a snicker bar
[2:11:22] <EndlessScrapper> If we can find a group of teenage girls we can sell these crystals and make some money!
[2:11:23] <%dankgerald> honl
[2:11:28] <+chiazam> Don't sell it Pat, it'll fit into a bigger treasure
[2:11:31] <+NateyBeak> zangeif noises
[2:11:33] <Phil_Morg> how are you feeling the game so far?
[2:11:34] <%walternatorz> so like, are there smart lycans and dumb lycans?
[2:11:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Buzzard42 About 1.5 hours of gameplay, I think
[2:11:44] <%ringabal> Oh no, Gief made it into Resident Evil
[2:11:44] <+SuperFineButtHairs> that sounds like a wolfmen
[2:11:46] <sweatch0> did ethan dip his fingies in flour?
[2:11:47] <%Buzzard42> ok
[2:11:48] <rudiciuscaesar> @EndlessScrapper especially if we find some tarot cards to go with the crystals.
[2:11:49] <%ItIsSky> corn demons
[2:11:57] <+HelloImTom08> grass or ass?
[2:11:57] <%dekkitout> Stealthin it up in the weeds
[2:11:59] <%dankgerald> amongst the CORN
[2:12:00] <Zerud> love how fast ethan's hands move when you change pistol to shotgun, it's like this man has 4 arms
[2:12:01] <LysdexicAndVolingit> @walternatorz From Suzi's nonspoiler review, pretty smart
[2:12:04] <%legendscar01> lure them to a shed then plant mine @PatStaresAt
[2:12:05] <%Treuan> don't go into the long grass, to quote that one guy
[2:12:15] <+chiazam> There's one right there
[2:12:16] <EndlessScrapper> @walternatorz They can ride horses and use bows so...I guess at least tribal human level smart?
[2:12:17] <%amused_platypus> @ItIsSky its children of the corn time all over again
[2:12:27] <NewWillinium> How much research does Capcom tend to do on locations?  Because It'll be interesting to see if the Religious iconography will lean towards Catholic or Orthodox.
[2:12:32] <%dankgerald> Run
[2:12:37] <%legendscar01> I was right
[2:12:40] <BaekTheHeck> those are some weird pokemon
[2:12:41] <%ringabal> HOLY SHIT ETHAN'S A TANK
[2:12:42] <penitentpendant> Nice pop
[2:12:42] <%Uselesswhitenoise> Look I know everyone loves the giant vampire titty lady, but i hope there's a short werewolf lady too
[2:12:44] <spawnzie> can you disarm them?
[2:12:45] <+MoonObscure> nice crit
[2:12:54] <%JoshManVGH> I think I'm going to try this on Casual. Those assholes seem tough.
[2:12:55] <+KingdomGene> Zombie pats?
[2:12:56] <Tisaric> god I love how they make enemies move in these modern RE games
[2:12:58] <NewWillinium> Alright Ethan you cut your teeth on those Mold Monsters. . . Now here's the REAL shit!
[2:13:00] <%SuperFineButtHairs> SuperFineButtHairs subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp

[2:13:16] <%AllenDeadman> yup
[2:13:16] <Khorneflakes_> phew
[2:13:17] <penitentpendant> Combo breath
[2:13:18] <+solarisknight7> It seems like resources are a bit more plentiful in this game than 7
[2:13:19] <cardamomo88> nice
[2:13:19] <NewWillinium> @Uselesswhitenoise was actually a pretty big fan of the small Vampire Lady.
[2:13:20] <%Cozy90> ??
[2:13:20] <Dr_Mooose> what?
[2:13:23] <+JonathLP> He breathed a sigh of relief?

[2:13:32] <+chiazam> Their bodies just dissolve
[2:13:33] <%SveriSageAdvice> Ethan breathed a sigh of relief

[2:13:43] <%patriotrenegade> me
[2:13:44] <+FlongBongle> I mean me
[2:13:46] <+bluestbee> Breathed at the same time
[2:13:47] <missingangle> Apparently, Capcom thinks it does
[2:13:48] <%legendscar01> More RE4
[2:13:50] <cardamomo88> the leon simps
[2:13:50] <mike2hands> ?
[2:13:50] <$KnivesEve> for real though
[2:13:51] <+MoonObscure> i do
[2:13:51] <+superchronicc> re 4 who?
[2:13:52] <+Cactuskris> I want a game that plays good though
[2:13:52] <%Buzzard42> me
[2:13:52] <+Buzzkill983> This isn't an RE4 remake? Kappa
[2:13:56] <oOZtkOo> ethan exhaled the same time pat did
[2:13:57] <Fien111> I pray they skip it for CVX
[2:13:59] <%dankgerald> grass
[2:14:00] <%Frost_Quill> @butcherbirb They sighed in relief at the exact same time.
[2:14:02] <majindusto> WE NEVER NEEDED A RE4 REMAKE
[2:14:03] <%Maids4lyfe> put Spanish dub on this, boom RE4
[2:14:04] <+tibblesx> What was he laughing at?
[2:14:05] <+Gohyakuen> Are people in chat deaf?
[2:14:05] <NewWillinium> ManyATrueNerd described these Lycans, Werewolves(?), as having Fallout 4 Deathclaw Dodge tech and I can see it
[2:14:08] <penitentpendant> RE Double 4
[2:14:09] <Zantetzuken> no suplexes here though
[2:14:09] <dinnydanny777> They are
[2:14:10] <%AllenDeadman> no shit
[2:14:10] <cis_eraser_420> re4 remake better let me get the fuckin jacket back
[2:14:10] <+MoonObscure> yes
[2:14:12] <%Nekros4442> Agreed
[2:14:12] <+Fenris_Alexius> oh yeah
[2:14:12] <JaerHQ> TRU
[2:14:12] <dukenux> oh yea
[2:14:13] <sweatch0> mold people tho...
[2:14:14] <+Fenris_Alexius> not even close
[2:14:14] <%weissguard> Without a doubt
[2:14:14] <sullivansbizarreadventure> This is just a more realistic RE4
[2:14:15] <rudiciuscaesar> The Molded had nothing going for them.
[2:14:15] <EndlessScrapper> I will not be satisfied until I get my first person monster puncher game. Not dlc full game
[2:14:15] <+g8rhead> molded were kind of hot garbage tbh
[2:14:15] <+solarisknight7> I mean they have actual effort put into them
[2:14:15] <mannywatcha> THey look cooler at least.
[2:14:17] <KingKZ> No shit
[2:14:18] <%patriotrenegade> no shit
[2:14:18] <%dave323dave> not a very high bar there
[2:14:18] <+solarisknight7> Also tells
[2:14:18] <+kastev> Yeah
[2:14:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I really like how the Lycans look
[2:14:19] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt Lycans or Ganados?
[2:14:19] <xavi_is_here> they actually dodge
[2:14:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> Nobody needs an RE4 remake because OG RE4 still holds up.
[2:14:19] <Giztech> I am waiting for Leon to do a camio or a reference to him somewhere
[2:14:19] <+chiazam> SCRUNGE
[2:14:19] <Gorgs7> I mean yes, but both suck
[2:14:20] <%Monkeyweed21> easily
[2:14:20] <count_bob> 100%
[2:14:21] <%SuperFineButtHairs> is that even a question?
[2:14:22] <Mister_McDerp> they really are
[2:14:22] <%Frost_Quill> The special molded like Jack were really cool though.
[2:14:23] <LoneFonte> absolutely
[2:14:23] <+CammerTime21> FOR SURE
[2:14:24] <a_mad_dragon_> 1000% better
[2:14:25] <BreakerDS> Wow, look at the VIDEO GAME
[2:14:25] <%dekkitout> But lichen is basically mold SeriousSloth
[2:14:25] <MrChaosDoughnut> Molded are kinda awful.
[2:14:25] <Ravioli_Ronin> I just want another Leon game
[2:14:26] <ape_hawk> have you taken a lycan to them?
[2:14:26] <+xiccy> But Pat. Money.
[2:14:26] <TheFramedWarlock> Who needs Resident Evil anymore when you have big lady fanart
[2:14:26] <majindusto> CODE VERONICA  REMAKE  FFS
[2:14:27] <+Qexec> well thats not a high standard to reach
[2:14:27] <+superchronicc> re 4 eva
[2:14:27] <alextrebeken> has there ever been a lame werewolf
[2:14:27] <stiffybiro> at least there‚Äôs more than 1 fucking character model
[2:14:28] <dinnydanny777> They aren't mold
[2:14:28] <chamblers> everything is better than the molded
[2:14:28] <%AllenDeadman> this is RE 4 by 4
[2:14:29] <%MelBrooksKA> That's a low bar
[2:14:30] <+MoonObscure> they bite :)
[2:14:30] <MrFriendlyDude> on god I don't fuck with mold
[2:14:32] <+Fenris_Alexius> they juke and kive
[2:14:32] <+NiktenKing> I dunno I like my squiggly men
[2:14:32] <Zerud> The mold was fun for punchies
[2:14:33] <SomeAsianDood> Wait why is this a discussion?
[2:14:34] <%nicoleymcquack> like I feel like they thought they could get around an re4 remake if they just integrate a ton of stuff into this
[2:14:35] <sullivansbizarreadventure> Yeah
[2:14:36] <%garbageheaphound> THEY RIDE HORSES
[2:14:36] <Shadooper> I just want a new game with Leon
[2:14:37] <%livlinn> Dogg people!
[2:14:37] <rudiciuscaesar> the only molded that was cool was the one that was Satan
[2:14:38] <Fien111> An especially aggressive dish rag is better than the Molded
[2:14:38] <%BoxNavy> yeah but mold is funny
[2:14:38] <penitentpendant> They have weapons
[2:14:39] <Vertigheist> im tired of leon
[2:14:40] <Meta_Four> lichen vs. mold
[2:14:41] <Shadope342> Still pissed how little they did with RE5's setting for enemy design
[2:14:41] <Basch71> this game is just Bloodborne with RE4 gameplay
[2:14:41] <+superchronicc> re 4 sure
[2:14:41] <cardamomo88> puppers
[2:14:42] <$floralkami> @gohyakuen no, tho some aren't wearing headphones, or paint attention to little moments like that
[2:14:42] <Shadooper> Leon is a qt
[2:14:45] <+FlongBongle> @gohyakuen chat is deaf, dumb and blind LUL
[2:14:45] <dinnydanny777> They vibe
[2:14:45] <%Nordguy> i LIKE the mold conureHMM
[2:14:45] <mannywatcha> That molded has a different arm
[2:14:46] <+JonathLP> @PatStaresAt Still need an RE4 remake for more Leon. Unless....
[2:14:46] <Meekest> They have horses
[2:14:46] <MidnightPacif1c> LUL
[2:14:47] <%walternatorz> but spikes! they have spikes occasionally
[2:14:47] <sullivansbizarreadventure> Ye
[2:14:49] <%caramelatte1> Yeah but thats like comparing literal shit to months old rotten food
[2:14:49] <devanmuse> The Lycans RIDE FUCKING HORSES!
[2:14:50] <%dankgerald> do story
[2:14:50] <+SuperFineButtHairs> psaDab
[2:14:50] <$floralkami> *paying
[2:14:51] <sweatch0> they lie and eat hot chip
[2:14:52] <NewWillinium> Between Molded, Super Molded, Crawler Molded, and . . .Blade Molded?
[2:14:52] <+Mowsferatu> they're mold hat at this point
[2:14:53] <susukouhai> ok furry
[2:14:53] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt Lycans or Ganados?
[2:14:53] <xavi_is_here> Resident Evil 7 had 4 molded types
[2:14:54] <%Frost_Quill> Werewolves on horses.
[2:14:54] <BreakerDS> Interpretive dance/10
[2:14:55] <%Pookiedaexzile> Some have weapons
[2:14:55] <Sundaysmiles01> They do 12am nightclub moves
[2:14:56] <mannywatcha> This miolded is just a licker
[2:14:56] <%SpcOpsBear> @PatStaresAt Lycans are to Los Ganados as Molded are to Zombies
[2:14:56] <%jtdobyns> they can use weapons
[2:14:57] <JetpackMcQuack> It's just like Thriller
[2:14:57] <+chiazam> The molded where only fun with PUNCH-MAN
[2:14:59] <Phil_Morg> the virgin molded vs the chad lycan
[2:15:00] <TioXyco> I don't
[2:15:01] <%solracc25> speak
[2:15:01] <xavi_is_here> two of which weere super uncommon
[2:15:01] <sullivansbizarreadventure> They use weapons!
[2:15:03] <+Romuken> @PatStaresAt just realized that Lena's husband, Morell, is the Lizard Brain.  At least the VA is.
[2:15:03] <LoneFonte> the lycan dance
[2:15:04] <passiveaggressivekisses> kiwisiDab
[2:15:05] <%pyrojack6> Molded and Molded with psaBig Gross Shield Arm
[2:15:05] <neon_z1> the fun part
[2:15:06] <%BoxNavy> they do do that part
[2:15:06] <%ejackalope> will we get different types of lycan??
[2:15:07] <Laecerelius> Jukes
[2:15:07] <Therusher> But are they better than Las Plagas tho
[2:15:08] <$ringabal> THEIR LEADER IS A GODDAMN LION
[2:15:08] <Gorgs7> they're really just the villagers reskinned so meh
[2:15:10] <EndlessScrapper> Yeah but lycans also will piss in your house to mark their territory. Molded wont do that to ya
[2:15:11] <Reziart> they have swords
[2:15:11] <+Puppet88> theyre also kinda hot, i mean what- who said that?
[2:15:13] <Tisaric> the wonky movement that they do similar to the RE2/3make zombies is so fucking good as an enemy design
[2:15:13] <xavi_is_here> you saw them shoot arrows and ride horses though
[2:15:14] <%toolofparanoia> they can wield weapons
[2:15:15] <%sporeian94> So what are the RE9 enemies gonna be? Mummies?
[2:15:16] <thackattack00> the lycans don't yell at you in spanish tho
[2:15:16] <%AllenDeadman> They are a bit less... braindead than ganados
[2:15:20] <rudiciuscaesar> but RE7 has Lucas, who is probably the best RE villain, simply because he's just an asshole.
[2:15:21] <mannywatcha> My video is skipping
[2:15:21] <%nicoleymcquack> all the re4 stans got real mad real quick just now
[2:15:22] <user_naim> The moled had a gool gross factor though, and a nice texture
[2:15:23] <%DrTomT18> @pyrojack6 dont forget spider molded
[2:15:23] <+MoonObscure> lol

[2:16:54] <%nicoleymcquack> I mean it happened when they took your baby when the van was hijacked so ya
[2:16:55] <%pyrojack6> Mold Baby?
[2:16:55] <+Thunder_Poo> demon baby
[2:16:55] <Calamity2007> "We got the baby time to torch this shit down"
[2:16:56] <+FlongBongle> That was said earlier
[2:16:57] <rudiciuscaesar> @Zerud Man, I was going to get this for Steam but not now, that's too much of thing with me, especially since I broke those last two fingers and was in a cast for half a year.
[2:16:59] <cis_eraser_420> the old lady did say shit started going down when rose appeared
[2:16:59] <%dankgerald> almost like rose is edie

[2:28:45] <mannywatcha> They do not give you alot of shotgun amo
[2:28:46] <%BoxNavy> yeeea,,,,
[2:28:47] <Zerud> I'm telling, he has 4 arms!!

[2:29:20] <%ZeludeRose> BOWs more like BBWs
[2:29:20] <fragdar> i really thought that the old woman¬¥s house would be more significant than just "hey, they are here just to die"
[2:29:22] <%Raikouija> on fire btw
[2:29:23] <%EbolaBeetle> the fire's gonna take a while
[2:29:24] <Vertigheist> spooky scary skeleton BOWs when

[2:29:27] <%Deft_Thought> You missed a drawer
[2:29:27] <EndlessScrapper> "I am going to build a intelligent living weapon! Every other time someone has tried this it went horrible and the creations turned on their creators but this time it will surely work!'
[2:29:32] <rudiciuscaesar> Did they say what part of Romania this is in? Like, Transylvania, Bessarabia?
[2:29:33] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[2:29:34] <+chiazam> blind
[2:29:35] <%bassoontyphoon> this reminds me of that difficult intro puzzle in bioshock infinite

[2:29:37] <%NocturneNovember> @ZeludeRose Shit, I wish
[2:29:37] <%BoxNavy> fire doesnt spread during the winter
[2:29:37] <NewWillinium> Why does *that* feel like the most unrealistic thing in this series?
[2:29:37] <dukenux> Silver bullets might work better against lycans, which funny might still makes snese in the context of this game
[2:29:37] <Calamity2007> @ZeludeRose That's not till later
[2:29:39] <coreroma> Its almost like RE7 And RE4 had a Mold Baby.
[2:29:41] <Siconia> It's a localised fire

[2:30:01] <%ArCielArDor> Imagine Resident Evil with Disco Elysium's playstyle
[2:30:02] <PlumpPotatoRump> bruh these people have washing machines and shit, there is no way they'd dress like ppl from the 19th century. Maybe it's just a fashion statement
[2:30:06] <HeroToxiko> @NewWillinium can't lose yer keys if they're attached to useful giant tool
[2:30:06] <%muXPerience> yeah streaming literally lowers visual calculus by 2 at least

[2:30:25] <%Monkeyweed21> this idea is terrible
[2:30:26] <vVAstrAVv> please swear we wont understand blindness as bad as paige
[2:30:26] <BeezusHrist> @EndlessScrapper I don't mind that, but when capcom can't localize a game and keep me immersed... that's where we have problems LUL
[2:30:26] <Josef_Stryker> FLOOR IT
[2:30:28] <%ZeludeRose> VERY SMART VERY GOOD OUTCOME
[2:30:28] <%EbolaBeetle> 19th century clothing is fucking dapper

[2:30:32] <Ultimatefool> @doc_ock_rokc Sssshhhhh
[2:30:32] <+Totally_Not_Toby> he learned from the last game
[2:30:34] <%nicoleymcquack> ethans like "watch this I'm really good at driving inside"
[2:30:34] <%Nekros4442> Yeah that's a good point. Why is tihs an American car
[2:30:34] <rudiciuscaesar> I think lei is the old Romanian currency, like the old Italian lira.

[2:30:40] <mannywatcha> What is with ethan driving cars inside a building?
[2:30:40] <%Deft_Thought> @PlumpPotatoRump Might be an aesthetic desired by Mother Miranda or somethin
[2:30:40] <%solracc25> Ethan last time with the mold this didn't work
[2:30:40] <sandsim> nice going ethan

[2:33:42] <sweatch0> true
[2:33:42] <WillofGame> Lower cost of living.
[2:33:42] <DukeBlack_> poor
[2:33:42] <%solracc25> She should be screaming
[2:33:42] <+CammerTime21> Ethan Winters has an aura of suffering around him
[2:33:43] <%JoshManVGH> "That place sucks!"
[2:33:43] <%linSP> so JUST DIE I GUESS
[2:33:44] <fuji_92> cause it was safe before pat
[2:33:44] <Fro5tburn> it has great scenery 4Head
[2:33:44] <%crimsonharvest> Because being devout makes you stupid
[2:33:44] <LunarRemix> Because their parents did? Idk tradition
[2:33:45] <+MuffledEurobeat> GREAT property taxes
[2:33:46] <+Mowsferatu> it's castle super beast
[2:33:46] <librettodude> "The world is FUCKED but it's OUR WORLD"
[2:33:46] <IminyourBase> just take your village and push it OVER THERE
[2:33:46] <cardamomo88> BEACUSE THEY'RE POOR PAT
[2:33:47] <%AllenDeadman> fanatism
[2:33:47] <Dr_Mooose> cheap
[2:33:47] <teflonbilly777> MOTHER MIRANDA PROTECTED THEM UP TO NOW
[2:33:48] <dinnydanny777> Nice landscape, pretty snow :)
[2:33:48] <NewWillinium> Maybe they can't afford to move?   Or are not allowed to leave?
[2:33:48] <mannywatcha> If i was born in this town i would have gotten out of here.
[2:33:48] <captainnathaniel> probably cant leave
[2:33:49] <%ZeludeRose> poor
[2:33:49] <Khorneflakes_> Yeah more context from her, was needed
[2:33:49] <%Raikouija> AGAIN
[2:33:50] <%Broken_Sonex> @BaronVonSilkyBeard But he's our Self insert!
[2:33:50] <%BoxNavy> well SOMEONE has to live here
[2:33:51] <spawnzie> moving can be hard
[2:33:51] <%nicoleymcquack> idk why ethan is being a lil bitch like this, bro you know what's happening bro you done this before
[2:33:51] <%Teintstein> No income tax
[2:33:51] <Shardlab> I would walk barefoot through hell AWAY from here
[2:33:52] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> low taxes?
[2:33:52] <TurranosOrn> Why do the Amish stay in their Amish towns?
[2:33:52] <%jorniev> NOW ITS ONE GUY VS ARMIES OF MONSTERS
[2:33:53] <%toolofparanoia> CASTLES CURSED YO
[2:33:53] <LatverianBadger> AND YOU COULD HAAVE IT AAAALL
[2:33:53] <+theTasdingo> what is poverty pat
[2:33:54] <Laecerelius> Only Claire can be new wife!!!
[2:33:54] <%MonsterEnvy> I think they don't like the Castle, but until today there was no monsters
[2:33:54] <%caramelatte1> yeah logic is odd
[2:33:55] <Vertigheist> I'm kinda thinking by the end of this game, ethan is gonna be done with women
[2:33:55] <+JonathLP> Damn, time to find a new new wife
[2:33:55] <%patriotrenegade> This USED to be a nice neighborhood
[2:33:55] <%Monkeyweed21> poverty and religion
[2:33:55] <%legendscar01> 3 finger Ethan
[2:33:56] <+Gohyakuen> ouch
[2:33:56] <Gelphaze> Good Shit!!
[2:33:58] <%Cozy90> DIDNT THAT HURT YOUR HAND???
[2:33:58] <no123450n> hand abuse
[2:33:58] <+mckraven> they were here first the evil is new
[2:33:58] <LoneFonte> LUL
[2:33:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think it's cuz the FOV is super narrow that the perspective is kinda fucked up
[2:33:59] <+VoytekBus> better than Baltimore...
[2:33:59] <Siconia> Ow my missing fingers
[2:33:59] <+titansloth93> just whack right on the bite wound
[2:33:59] <%jyeowa> man that had to hurt
[2:34:00] <dan_g_v> they had pizza?
[2:34:00] <+mrshazboto> Because you're a MOLD MONSTER ETHAN
[2:34:00] <+Thunder_Poo> Bio babby
[2:34:00] <%Puhff> Abuse is a hell of a drug
[2:34:00] <%templar010> Because big bio terrorism
[2:34:00] <%SuperFineButtHairs> cuz bio hazard
[2:34:01] <rudiciuscaesar> I love Ethan's self-awareness though
[2:34:01] <+Buzzkill983> I would not punch with open hand like that.
[2:34:01] <$Teh_Un> Thank god for the millitary training
[2:34:02] <Teyaric> he just smashed his gutted hand into the wall???????
[2:34:03] <+DBTenno> Now he smacked his wounded bloody hand into the dirty wooden wall
[2:34:03] <PinoProxie> ethan, you pounded you finger holes
[2:34:04] <Calamity2007> Because we and capcom wanted a sequel Ethan
[2:34:05] <+rocko_125> dang it i am back at the baker estate
[2:34:05] <EndlessScrapper> "Has this place gone mad?" Asked the man who is part immortal mold
[2:34:05] <SomeAsianDood> Tax haven?
[2:34:06] <%EbolaBeetle> That mold healing would work wonders now
[2:34:06] <%ZeludeRose> how did he punch with that hand??
[2:34:06] <count_bob> Again!
[2:34:07] <%majorpeppy> why did you bash your fucked up raw hand ont he doorframe
[2:34:09] <%shurtal> We Need TerraSave!
[2:34:09] <Portal_Operater> To expensive to move to the city.
[2:34:10] <%ospreyworks> Because you stuck your dick in crazy, Ethan.
[2:34:10] <%MandMGrease> TERRORISMS RUINED MY LIFE AGAIN
[2:34:12] <%Deft_Thought> Oh, was that Iulian's shotgun she grabbed in that scene?
[2:34:13] <%ZeludeRose> HE PUNCHED WITH THE STUMP SIDE
[2:34:13] <+Golinvoxx> did the gas in that truck not explode?
[2:34:14] <Tisaric> Ethan feeling the curse of being an RE protag
[2:34:14] <Babooboomin> does he not feel pain with that hand lol
[2:34:14] <%hrbeck_> This is really is the Resident Evil Village
[2:34:15] <+CatsEyeBlind> Did he just smash his stump into the wall
[2:34:16] <+BaronVonSilkyBeard> that was just as far as she fell and you literally stepped off the edge and floated down like mary poppins
[2:34:16] <Ravioli_Ronin> They probably get fucked if they try to leave the village
[2:34:16] <+DBTenno> Even Ethan hates his own hand
[2:34:17] <rudiciuscaesar> Leon just goes "yeah whatever, I'm tough" and Chris punches boulders.
[2:34:19] <dinnydanny777> Have you seen the view from these houses? That's a million Euro property right there
[2:34:20] <+chiazam> Ethan's pissed
[2:34:21] <%solracc25> This damn mold
[2:34:22] <+FlongBongle> @teyaric it‚Äôs fine
[2:34:22] <%JoshManVGH> Probably mother meranda protects the village, but not the castle.
[2:34:22] <balthazar758> because of umbrellas Ethan ‚òî
[2:34:23] <%EbolaBeetle> He could have just unscrewed this with the knife
[2:34:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> They need to be saved, by TerraSave
[2:34:26] <Phil_Morg> wow Ethan actually forreal lost those fingers huh
[2:34:28] <+ArtsyFoxo> Ethan is like the only RE character that is reacting to this scenario like we would
[2:34:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> Everybody wanna die in a Poetic fire till that flame hit ya ass
[2:34:30] <%flechet> this is why you dont stick your dick in crazy
[2:34:30] <coreroma> Why u kill all my Waifuuus Capcom?
[2:34:31] <HeroToxiko> they live there cuz poor
[2:34:32] <xeros720> lot of effort for a screwdriver
[2:34:34] <+traximus_s> only fire lives there now
[2:34:36] <%AllenDeadman> Yeah
[2:34:39] <dimensaur> this is all an elaborate plot to get Ethan to put a mold baby in Claire
[2:34:41] <mannywatcha> Another survivor?
[2:34:42] <%walternatorz> that's new?
[2:34:44] <%SuperFineButtHairs> Chris?
[2:34:46] <Laecerelius> This is less bioterror and more biocurse
[2:34:46] <NewWillinium> @TurranosOrn In fairness I think that's from Religious Tradition and even then they send their kids to live in modernity before they make the choice to live in the Amish lifestyle or away from it
[2:34:46] <+FlongBongle> I never played RE6 so this doesn‚Äôt apply to me 4Head
[2:34:47] <dinnydanny777> Didn't they nuke a city in China
[2:34:47] <Parapattern> It's the biocurse
[2:34:47] <%MonsterEnvy> Oh yeah the guy with the shotgun
[2:34:48] <spawnzie> wasn't there a kaiju in 6
[2:34:48] <+Cactuskris> like covid
[2:34:48] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt it is literally a cult, they cant leave
[2:34:50] <+ballzxxtoxxyou> How are the villagers speaking perfect English....

[2:36:36] <%skizzuto> please don't tell me that the old lady is secretly Rose
[2:36:37] <+FlongBongle> @patstaresat that was underground grandma
[2:36:38] <fuji_92> the body evaporated dude
[2:36:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @Calamity2007 I missed the demo too lol. So im not too late lol
[2:36:39] <Khorneflakes_> LUL that old lady is having a great time
[2:36:40] <+teh_rawk> shoot the gun
[2:36:41] <chhdez> Gran mamma Miranda
[2:36:41] <hardin360> You have it Pat
[2:36:44] <HeroToxiko> oh shit yeah that old lady is mother miranda
[2:36:45] <Phil_Morg> you would think Ethan would be more stoked on killing grandmas after Eveline
[2:36:45] <%caramelatte1> Did pat pick up the shotgun?
[2:36:45] <+TensecondTarvis> wasnt it in the shed?
[2:36:47] <+chiazam> What shotgun?
[2:36:48] <Giztech> find that goat thing
[2:36:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> This game seems to have a lot of things that make it really hard to see
[2:36:52] <EndlessScrapper> This is not realistic at all. As Romania was part of the USSR every house should have at least one Ak47. Its just tradition
[2:36:52] <BeezusHrist> Maybe the baby IS evelyn reborn @PatStaresAt
[2:36:54] <Imbetweenjobs_> why isnt paige just looming over pat the whole playthrough?
[2:36:57] <Laecerelius> Calling it, old lady is Rose
[2:36:58] <xavi_is_here> She's Wesker
[2:36:58] <%SuperFineButtHairs> thats nice dear
[2:36:58] <%bassoontyphoon> I feel like somehow Mia's storybook bled out into reality
[2:36:59] <%legendscar01> you missed like two shotguns, people
[2:36:59] <+chiazam> The one you have?
[2:37:03] <MyNameIsRasus> she's drawing the amestris transmutation circle
[2:37:03] <Giztech> wooden goat in the field
[2:37:04] <%nicoleymcquack> that old lady is rose from the future
[2:37:04] <doc_ock_rokc> save pat
[2:37:04] <Meekest> If Paige were here she'd do her old woman voice
[2:37:06] <rudiciuscaesar> goat thing sounds horrifying
[2:37:07] <dukenux> Old woman gives me merchant vibes, despite there being a merchant in the game
[2:37:07] <+Gohyakuen> is that the witch that cursed Paige?
[2:37:08] <%walternatorz> that's how I expect Paige to spend her retirement
[2:37:10] <+Golinvoxx> nah old lady is mother
[2:37:10] <jbmay> that old lady is yucking it up super hard.
[2:37:11] <boogaleeboo> And will he now scrape before moving on?
[2:37:11] <+BedHome> maybe the baybe is evilak reborn
[2:37:15] <DancesWitBalrog> Ahh this again
[2:37:16] <+chiazam> Save?
[2:37:19] <+rocko_125> save the game
[2:37:20] <Phil_Morg> ZE DEMON
[2:37:23] <%BoxNavy> ze demon
[2:37:24] <deadredeyez> skulls for the skull cane
[2:37:25] <rudiciuscaesar> Evilak lmao
[2:37:33] <HeroToxiko> Almost LUL
[2:37:33] <sullivansbizarreadventure> ‚ÄúDeath has visited them all!‚Äù
[2:37:33] <mannywatcha> Man it would suck if saves were lmited.
[2:37:34] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Is old lady... CHRIS REDFIELD?
[2:37:34] <%legendscar01> Anymore Spinels
[2:37:34] <NewWillinium> . . .Why does this ANCIENT CASTLE AND VILLAGE have puzzle doors?
[2:37:35] <Giztech> Pat goat thing in the tall grass
[2:37:36] <%dankgerald> garme psaPat
[2:37:36] <Khorneflakes_> You're welcome :)

[2:37:54] <+Gespens> Oh no, mommy vampire is 1?
[2:37:54] <boogaleeboo> She talks about her idiot brother, wouldn't he be 1?
[2:37:55] <Phil_Morg> not a bad guess
[2:37:56] <Dr_Mooose> wonna bet on it?
[2:37:57] <fuji_92> nah, lady d the first?  never
[2:37:57] <+Thunder_Poo> BIG Mommy Shrine!? Kreygasm

[2:38:07] <therealritzreal> doubt
[2:38:07] <%Caped_Eggy> NO, not the big lady NotLikeThis
[2:38:08] <missingangle> Keeping that in mind, though I hope Big Lady Woman doesn't die first
[2:38:10] <%jorniev> damn pat
[2:38:10] <mannywatcha> That is kinda hard to see and look at.
[2:38:11] <spawnzie> don't forget Chris

[2:46:20] <BeezusHrist> @BappoTheMighty Wait until you get to shadowbringers. Endwalker this month. Hurry up
[2:46:22] <$Daisuke89> Oh, U is not silent at all. Dimitrescu is correct the way pat says it.
[2:46:24] <kazadaz> It was often spelled "Rumania" or "Roumania" (in English sources) pre-WWII
[2:46:24] <James_Quivers> Lady D = Witch of Izalith, Heisenberg = Gwyn, Hunchback = Nito, Doll = Furtive Pgymy

[2:46:30] <%SeaReally> Capcom is wrong the U is definitely pronounced
[2:46:30] <+Akabane101> What word are we talking about? sorry I came in late.
[2:46:31] <%bread_assassin> If any of y'all know the streamer runebee, she can confirm that the "u" is NOT silent.
[2:46:31] <sharpened_hammer> Can't wait for y'all to hear it said in game.
[2:46:31] <%Macguffn> If there's one thing I learned from pat it's that U are never silent
[2:46:33] <%SpcOpsBear> Apparently Lady Dimitrescu's first name is Alcina?

[2:46:39] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> According to romanias the U is pronouced and the voice acting is fucked up (possible due to japanese phonetic translation type stuff)
[2:46:39] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Has Memes Happened? Has big m9mma vampire milkers happened?
[2:46:39] <%SpcOpsBear> And yeah Capcom is wrong

[2:47:03] <dinnydanny777> Romania isn't real, it can't hurt you
[2:47:05] <rudiciuscaesar> the "escu" sound is not silent, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, communist dictator of Romanian, the escu is said very prominently
[2:47:08] <James_Quivers> Like emotions
[2:47:08] <Yakobro> @PatStaresAt according to woolie rats can swim
[2:47:08] <T_Sasquatch> Like love

[2:47:20] <Pat_Squared> yeah they've said the name but the correct pronunciation should be silent
[2:47:21] <sullivansbizarreadventure> I hate to say it. But these new villains are better than the RE7 villains already
[2:47:21] <Grennold> "Romania is a place" - Woolie 2021
[2:47:22] <rudiciuscaesar> Rats can totally swim
[2:47:22] <EndlessScrapper> Well yeah. SOmeone from a fake place like "Grenada" would make up a lot of stuff
[2:47:23] <+VoytekBus> just like Austria, doesn't exist
[2:47:28] <xavi_is_here> Woolie can barely pay attention to a video games surrounding let alone geopgrahy
[2:47:29] <Pat_Squared> no not silent
[2:47:31] <Teyaric> Can we like.... NOT make a point of shitting over the poor guy's bad education?
[2:47:32] <+thegreenbenis> Spoilers are just chemicals. @PatStaresAt

[2:47:41] <+sonofthedeepsouth> It does not

[2:47:45] <BaekTheHeck> no romania, only moldova
[2:47:46] <%Uselesswhitenoise> put the gotse guy to shame
[2:47:46] <%Pookiedaexzile> enough to take them

[2:47:47] <LoneFonte> they don't care
[2:47:47] <rudiciuscaesar> Man, I was gonna draw tonight but I  guess I will draw in between the hypest
[2:47:48] <dukenux> Romania is a fictional country from that one Charlie Chaplin movie
[2:47:49] <+VivaLetina> they didnt think youre a threat
[2:47:50] <Zerud> full circle...
[2:47:50] <captainnathaniel> if yall think Ethan surviving this is bullshit, in the movies Leon survived a full strenght Punch from a Mr. X class tyrant, being sent straight into a solid column, and he was fine
[2:47:50] <%walternatorz> this is where you started
[2:47:52] <PinoProxie> it kinda makes sense, your were wrapped in metal, never stripped
[2:47:52] <coreroma> According to Woolie, Wool is a myth invented by Sheep
[2:47:54] <+MrJerples> Didnt take them i guess
[2:47:54] <Khorneflakes_> They probably don't care whether you're armed or not
[2:47:54] <hexen_emma> Now normally we'd do the smart thing and LEAVE
[2:47:54] <%MelBrooksKA> Romania is real, now Quebec is a made up place spyCappa
[2:47:57] <BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt CApcom's lack of attention to detail....
[2:47:57] <%speaks2much> isekai item box
[2:47:58] <+chiazam> He didn't disarm you
[2:48:01] <hexen_emma> But we aren't smart.

[2:48:16] <@Moobot> @user_naim I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 48m.
[2:48:16] <%bassoontyphoon> hell of a detour
[2:48:19] <SomeAsianDood> Quebec doesn't exist. Why would a place have bagged milk
[2:48:19] <rudiciuscaesar> Moldova uses Romanian but I think it is notably different
[2:48:19] <Grennold> Wool is a myth invented by sheep so we wouldn't kill them for their meat Kappa
[2:48:20] <T_Sasquatch> Living in a giant Castle isn't great
[2:48:21] <$Dreadlord134> Wow that‚Äôs really bad
[2:48:22] <%lucky_icarus> Ethan stored it in his massive balls
[2:48:22] <dinnydanny777> A Scareman limesHmm
[2:48:22] <sullivansbizarreadventure> They had to make it fair
[2:48:23] <dan_g_v> Quebec doesn't exists, the lore Pat and Woolie talk about is too absurd to be real
[2:48:23] <%thbluewarden> how bad could the four lords be? they didnt even take your guns
[2:48:23] <boogaleeboo> kill birb
[2:48:24] <+PickyPrinny> More sport
[2:48:25] <kazadaz> new enemy type??
[2:48:25] <EndlessScrapper> So...what are ya buying?
[2:48:25] <akitanito> they are corpses
[2:48:28] <%JoshManVGH> They were probably super magnitized to Ethans body
[2:48:28] <+flipman107> and there be crows
[2:48:29] <Khorneflakes_> Look at more of this Dark Souls
[2:48:30] <%garbageheaphound> wait where;d you get your gun?

[2:48:33] <+ShudMirelurk> Is this what Laval looks like?
[2:48:35] <%Drunkengen> Are we gonna see the merchant now?
[2:48:37] <%dekkitout> This game has been a wild ride
[2:48:38] <Portal_Operater> It makes sense, that Bloodborne guy just trapped you and not stripped you of your weapons.
[2:48:40] <akitanito> were man

[3:01:46] <%AllenDeadman> I don't think the medicine alone is healing him pat, it may be that he still got that mold shit
[3:01:46] <%RedMageRebel> theres no way he survives this game, hes getting so fucked lmao
[3:01:48] <+flipman107> and a big gap in his right
[3:01:48] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt check the glass
[3:01:48] <%Sasha_conyst> as a reminder he got the left arm cut off and it healed him
[3:01:49] <no123450n> its okay he's got sauce
[3:01:50] <Teras_ode> he re-attached a leg and an arm in the last game Pat
[3:01:50] <%Macguffn> I can totally believe his mold exp means regeneration at this point
[3:01:50] <+zzNamttamzz> Ethan is going to pull a Jack and regrow his head
[3:01:51] <%Buzzard42> it's fine he'll just grow it back
[3:01:51] <+bcom33> Maybe his hands will just literally have shotguns molded into them by the end
[3:01:51] <+Akabane101> not to mention his left hand was cut off in the last game xD
[3:01:52] <+SouLucha> FLESH WOUND
[3:01:52] <seniormeatbox> Does he still have the staples?
[3:01:52] <+chiazam> Can you examine the glass???
[3:01:52] <cis_eraser_420> she did literally say his blood tasted kinda stale
[3:01:52] <+Delenay> his legs have been hooked.
[3:01:52] <+xmaydayx1> Man, if I had a nickel for every time I was in this predicament
[3:01:54] <+Gohyakuen> Ethan has deadpool level regeneration
[3:01:54] <kazadaz> THEY LET HIM KEEP HIS GUNS?
[3:01:54] <Dio_TR> CHECK THE GLASS
[3:01:54] <+kastev> @PatStaresAt Did she just succ his mold blood
[3:01:55] <NeroInfinite> DOesn't he also have the fuckin spore shit in him too?
[3:01:55] <+grumbleroar> Like the black knight from monty python
[3:01:55] <%goose_attack_almanac> He didn't fix his leg btw
[3:01:55] <+durthknight> i think he is some sort of god
[3:01:55] <%DedlokPM> @PatStaresAt He literally reattached his hand with the stuff last game. How are you surprised at how miraculous it is?
[3:01:55] <+fetrigon> his super power is to regrow his hands SeemsGood
[3:01:56] <dukenux> the hand gore will be a running joke
[3:01:56] <%walternatorz> barbwire, breakfast, crucifixion
[3:01:56] <%jinking79> who has it worst Ethan or the guys from Outlast?
[3:01:58] <+Ilpala> at least most of it has stayed attached to his body this time!
[3:01:59] <%majorpeppy> He'll be a stump but he'll have a dick so he can continue the Redfield line
[3:01:59] <%ospreyworks> Gotta get rid of that wedding band somehow.
[3:02:00] <casualbaloth> mold man can't even regenerate fingers, jack would be so disappointed
[3:02:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> hows it going?
[3:02:02] <%ItIsSky> also the pipe Heisenburg sent straight into his chest
[3:02:02] <%genepark> This is funnier than I could‚Äôve ever imagined
[3:02:02] <$Auctorian> An easy pick lock- for those with working hands!
[3:02:02] <%BoxNavy> that lock is so easy to pick
[3:02:04] <%caramelatte1> How is he even walking after getting his tendons TORN
[3:02:05] <JeoDood> remember las game re7 he can put back  his leg
[3:02:07] <%ospreyworks> No more marriage for you, Ethan
[3:02:08] <%nicoleymcquack> his hands would just be unusable at this point
[3:02:08] <%Buzzard42> Ethan just has a healing factor
[3:02:08] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt check the glass pat
[3:02:09] <%bassoontyphoon> @PatStaresAt They probably keep hurting his hands since that the only part of him we see
[3:02:11] <alroy900> ethan seems to have build up some insane pain resistance
[3:02:13] <+mitchyb603> and 3 years before it was competely chopped off LUL
[3:02:13] <%ArCielArDor> Ethan needs a cookie and a nap
[3:02:15] <+mental_mashup> Ethan is ready for dead by daylight after being hooked LUL
[3:02:15] <seniormeatbox> @jinking79 Miles didn't have moldy juice
[3:02:15] <Vertigheist> ethan's mental state is hard af
[3:02:16] <%ospreyworks> No ring finger, no ring.
[3:02:16] <%Raikouija> Time for Maiden
[3:02:16] <%skizzuto> his poor interossei muscles
[3:02:16] <lloyddboy> RATS
[3:02:17] <+Akabane101> Anything is possible with a can of juice and staples.
[3:02:17] <NewWillinium> The fact that he can grip *anything* is bullshit right now
[3:02:17] <Josef_Stryker> The shitty thing about being a character that can heal from anything is that means you can be subjected to the worst bodily pain.
[3:02:19] <mannywatcha> There are still items in there.
[3:02:20] <+superkeaton> the treasure
[3:02:20] <%DoctorWrenchcoat> i bought that cup at a Spirit Halloween ten years ago
[3:02:20] <hexen_emma> Of COURSE there's a passage in the fireplace
[3:02:22] <metalwater8> Is todoroki from MHA around or something
[3:02:23] <%dankgerald> BUGS
[3:02:24] <dinnydanny777> That wind noise is very good
[3:02:27] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Shoot the glass
[3:02:27] <$Dreadlord134> Well there goes these villains being actually intelligent in any meaningful way,2 times the villains get the drop on him and neither time does he get his weapons taken away
[3:02:31] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ethan's gonna survive by grafting his decapacitated head onto someone else's body by the end of this game
[3:02:31] <+FlongBongle> !uptime
[3:02:32] <@Moobot> @FlongBongle I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 2m.

[3:02:40] <%Valdorick> THE EVIL EYE RING!?
[3:02:40] <trianglehat> scary ring
[3:02:42] <mannywatcha> I think you might wanna go back.
[3:02:44] <IminyourBase> maroon 5 ring
[3:02:45] <+paladinstarbuster> Reminder people ethan has a healing factor
[3:02:45] <AngryAsian5> Ethan just goes to show how OP super-healing can be as a power LUL
[3:02:45] <%ElkRiverDog> I appreciate that his hands are still wet
[3:02:46] <Teras_ode> glass?
[3:02:48] <+ArtsyFoxo> Ethan is a damn trooper man
[3:02:50] <Phil_Morg> is this ACTUALLY mold magic or?
[3:02:52] <Frostilk> I mean, if you really screwed up in RE7, Ethan had to reattach his foot
[3:02:52] <DaCheekyOne> Wait, didn't ethan lose his hand in re7?
[3:02:52] <Vertigheist> @Dreadlord134 you expect too much from resident evil
[3:02:53] <EndlessScrapper> ...Why does a vampire have healing potions laying around their house? You would assume it doesnt work on like...undead
[3:02:54] <stiffybiro> yo is that the red tearstone ring???
[3:02:57] <+ALazo> welcome to demo
[3:02:58] <+Mendin> That shotgun ammo recipe seems like it's VITAL to grab next
[3:03:01] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt I feel like Ethan needs to have some degree of the pain ignoring that the Bakers had in RE7, or he'd never be able to do this shit
[3:03:01] <trianglehat> big snores
[3:03:02] <%Raikouija> hows the RTX Pat?
[3:03:02] <fuji_92> you what the ring do? stamina regen?
[3:03:03] <Frostilk> that juice is literal magic
[3:03:03] <PartyFavors> @Dreadlord134 have you considered: "oh no we took all your equipment" levels suck 99 times out of 100
[3:03:04] <kazadaz> okay, so ropey lines on the wall mayu indicate secret passages
[3:03:05] <NewWillinium> Can we wear that goddamn armor? So that our hands quite being fucked up?

[3:03:31] <kazadaz> I mean to be fair, I'd probably leave the guns behind if I had a guy hanging from hooks in his hands
[3:03:31] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Hey, some breakables don't have prompts, so make sure to swig at those pots you walked by
[3:03:32] <+Mendin> the crimson glass, pat
[3:03:33] <BeezusHrist> @SpcOpsBear There is RTX on ps5
[3:03:34] <%BoxNavy> üëÅÔ∏è
[3:03:37] <%dankgerald> as long as you have the appendages on hand, you can reattach them. ethan's fingers were digested so thats permanent
[3:03:37] <Meta_Four> Do you still have the screwdriver?
[3:03:38] <+mental_mashup> Fuck the glass for no reason
[3:03:38] <%Broand> The one in your inventory?
[3:03:39] <$Ziegsy> Make their insurance weep
[3:03:40] <%SpcOpsBear> The glass is a treasure
[3:03:41] <Ianrazz> Wait I hear snores, is ethan gonna be attacked by gigantic cute pig dog? Be careful, Pat
[3:03:42] <benjiFG> the sound that plays when you get shit is stupid

[3:03:44] <digaogrunge> the wine glass Pat
[3:03:44] <Qsmash_> I wouldn't have guessed that the Village demo and Castle demo were literally right next to each other.

[3:17:48] <DianaTheAscian> wa? noooooo
[3:17:49] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I'd love to know how a virus made them die to fucking sunlight LUL
[3:17:49] <dragoon001914> What's 1958
[3:17:50] <%ejackalope> at least we know they are all over 28
[3:17:51] <Zombrocom> Vampires yo
[3:17:51] <Vertigheist> let's DIO these bitches!
[3:17:52] <therealritzreal> but bugs
[3:17:52] <%majorpeppy> Or since they're made of locusts they could lose themselves in a breeze?
[3:17:52] <kazadaz> thank you to whoever lit all those candles
[3:17:53] <xeros720> yup, sounds like a plan
[3:17:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> YES, I learned that shooting was a waste of bullets in the demo the hard way
[3:17:53] <ATentacleMonster> dangDev
[3:17:54] <%LailahQueenx> chat stfu right now
[3:17:54] <chhdez> Mompires

[3:17:55] <TetraDaimon> Just like Gamers
[3:17:56] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt Like Resident Evil Zero and the Leaches didn't like sunlight either
[3:17:56] <kingcarm216> Garlic
[3:17:57] <doc_ock_rokc> Or cold due to them being bugs
[3:17:58] <%EbolaBeetle> LOOK AT THE FAMILY PICTURE
[3:17:59] <BilboKong> hit em with the shampoo
[3:18:00] <+Buzzkill983> There only weakness is Sunlight! And this GUN
[3:18:01] <trianglehat> mommy
[3:18:01] <%AllenDeadman> why would they mention the heat if it was just sunlight
[3:18:01] <%JoshManVGH> Does that mean UV Gun before the game is over?
[3:18:02] <+titansloth93> everyone knows you kill vampires with silver bullets
[3:18:03] <missingangle> So we steal the sun, got it
[3:18:03] <deadredeyez> surprised pikachu
[3:18:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> you need to unlock hamon
[3:18:03] <ZE_Count> big booty
[3:18:04] <xavi_is_here> BIG LADY
[3:18:04] <mannywatcha> You know with so much BIo technology at hand you'd think they'd remove this obvious weakness.
[3:18:05] <%0rond> man the fact there's music is so weird
[3:18:05] <PinoProxie> COME BACK
[3:18:05] <CALLthaDoctah> BIG.
[3:18:06] <radix865> bug women are probably weak for fire too
[3:18:07] <+KaijuUltimax> Is this game a secret countdown vampires sequel?
[3:18:07] <+Thunder_Poo> YOOOOOOOO
[3:18:08] <%Nekros4442> Convienent
[3:18:09] <%BoxNavy> üçë

[3:18:12] <Dr_Mooose> follow that booty
[3:18:13] <missingangle> Wait come back!
[3:18:13] <hexen_emma> I was about to say "STOP"

[3:18:15] <%Monkeyweed21> COME BACK
[3:18:15] <Siconia> You people make me sick
[3:18:15] <dukenux> dammit come back here
[3:18:15] <%bread_assassin> If that happened at dinnertime, shouldn't the sun already be down, though?
[3:18:15] <chhdez> Is this Legacy of Kain power rules?
[3:18:16] <NewWillinium> It is very weird yeah
[3:18:16] <%EbolaBeetle> No
[3:18:16] <+JobbedBone> m OMEGALUL mmy
[3:18:16] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> Hot vampires craving for molded mushrooms
[3:18:17] <%sporeian94> Imagine fucking that dumper
[3:18:18] <+chiazam> come on
[3:18:19] <%BoxNavy> its funy
[3:18:19] <akitanito> yeah
[3:18:19] <%0rond> I don't think she was always that big
[3:18:19] <twohitgood> the castle probably existed before she did.
[3:18:20] <%Albadabar> She isn't the first to have lived there
[3:18:20] <%EbolaBeetle> that makes it hotter
[3:18:20] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Yup
[3:18:21] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, Pat, aren't you weak to the sunlight too? I'm a filthy ginger and direct sunlight ruins me.
[3:18:22] <%JoshManVGH> little bit goofy
[3:18:23] <dukenux> She outgrew it
[3:18:23] <+Thunder_Poo> Big Mommy Buitt
[3:18:23] <IminyourBase> like they built the castle before her, yeah
[3:18:23] <+BedHome> she grew
[3:18:23] <+paladinstarbuster> she grew
[3:18:23] <PinoProxie> it's so we know she big lady
[3:18:23] <+solarisknight7> Yeah
[3:18:24] <%walternatorz> she's a growing lady
[3:18:24] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Vampies don't like sunlight cause sun backwards is nus and thats nus good.
[3:18:24] <xavi_is_here> yes
[3:18:24] <NeroInfinite> Duh
[3:18:24] <$hrbeck_> butt
[3:18:24] <+ArtemisCroc> she keeps growing
[3:18:25] <Tisaric> yeah like what the fuck build her some normal doors
[3:18:25] <%legendscar01> She THICC
[3:18:25] <%LaughingCatt> hey man she grew
[3:18:25] <+MrJerples> she so fucking big i cant handle it
[3:18:26] <dragoon001914> She was smaller earlier I imagine
[3:18:26] <%CalderGaming> she's been growing for a while after moving in yeah
[3:18:26] <+adequateorange> yes
[3:18:27] <%AllenDeadman> huh
[3:18:27] <+JaseAdrift> well she need servants
[3:18:27] <%Broken_Sonex> Fat ass!
[3:18:28] <+solarisknight7> The files say that
[3:18:28] <trianglehat> yes that's the timeline I would think
[3:18:28] <lloyddboy> Heisenberg says she grows
[3:18:28] <+superkeaton> They probably keep killing the contractors
[3:18:28] <johnatella> she grew out of it, I guess.
[3:18:28] <%ospreyworks> Well, Heisenberg DID say "Keep growing!"
[3:18:28] <%DrTomT18> she has to duck under the door frames
[3:18:28] <Lutre> maybe she grew
[3:18:29] <%SeaReally> shes not the original owner tho
[3:18:29] <%BoxNavy> she became big
[3:18:30] <+solarisknight7> That you got
[3:18:31] <+FlongBongle> she was probably born smaller
[3:18:31] <%chiluzza> biyg lady
[3:18:32] <%Monkeyweed21> she wasnt always that size i bet
[3:18:32] <copametic> how big is her bed
[3:18:32] <seniormeatbox> Renovations are expensive
[3:18:32] <James_Quivers> She probably was smaller before all the blood drinking
[3:18:32] <vilecrois> Then why don't you live in a tiny house, Pat
[3:18:32] <Khorneflakes_> She is so accommodating
[3:18:33] <%red_cuppa> they said 'we aren't renovating for you bit tits'
[3:18:34] <Psyramics> it was built before she was big, she's been getting bigger
[3:18:34] <%RedMageRebel> I think she's getting bigger with age? Is the implication from Hisenberg?
[3:18:35] <PartyFavors> The things we do for aesthetics
[3:18:35] <%Caped_Eggy> Sounds like she became bigger later
[3:18:36] <%BubbaRands> More opportunities for her to bend over Kappa
[3:18:36] <%dankgerald> she drank her milk
[3:18:36] <%shurtal> Secondary Ownership
[3:18:36] <+proxiecat> Castle wasn't made for her though
[3:18:37] <+Matto424> theres simply no time
[3:18:37] <drakoknight> mommy milkers for scale
[3:18:37] <%0rond> I don't think they are in a position to renovate
[3:18:37] <Phil_Morg> is she a tyrant or nah?
[3:18:38] <DrunkenDice> you would think
[3:18:38] <fuji_92> nah that makes the pp the big pp
[3:18:38] <kazadaz> it's actually a hobbit-scale castle, ethan's like 3 foot 6
[3:18:38] <IminyourBase> she's not the first demetriscu
[3:18:39] <hexen_emma> You would think she'd just relac the doors.
[3:18:39] <twohitgood> or before she reached that size.
[3:18:39] <%ospreyworks> So, maybe she was normal sized once.
[3:18:39] <%SpcOpsBear> She got big, definitely.
[3:18:39] <+Ran196> it cost money to make things bigger
[3:18:40] <deeewooh> the castle existed before her
[3:18:41] <+Thunder_Poo> sit on my face
[3:18:41] <Meta_Four> I think she grew while she lived there.
[3:18:41] <%Ranryu692> nah, castles have tiny doorways
[3:18:41] <%herecomesmong0> She got big from the SUCC
[3:18:41] <%hrbeck_> She's been growing, her brother said
[3:18:42] <doc_ock_rokc> @chhdez LOK rules are normal vampire rules
[3:18:43] <MechanizedGentleman> she likes being bigger than everything
[3:18:44] <%Treuan> Some sort of super beast sized castle
[3:18:45] <ATentacleMonster> Ableist Pat
[3:18:45] <+grumbleroar> She hired a contractor but probably got hungry
[3:18:46] <%Albadabar> She gets bigger the more blood she takes in, she's basically a blood balloon
[3:18:47] <captainnathaniel> She can fit in, just not on the doors
[3:18:48] <xavi_is_here> Its Disney Land Rules
[3:18:49] <$floralkami> I don't think she's new, and the rest of them are not as tall
[3:18:50] <+EmptyPenguin> Heisenburg mentions that she's growing
[3:18:50] <lehvak182> G R A N D  C R O S S !
[3:18:50] <Teras_ode> have you not said exactly all of this already Pat, when you played the demo?
[3:18:50] <+Thunder_Poo> mommy juicers
[3:18:51] <xavi_is_here> Forced perspective
[3:18:52] <%toolofparanoia> she must have horrible back pain from all that bending
[3:18:53] <+Cinnerennic> she's got enough back problems huehuehue
[3:18:54] <+KaijuUltimax> Castle's have higher ceilings than regular houses
[3:18:54] <+Vampireinarm> the level design would be a nightmare if it was all to her scale tho
[3:18:55] <akitanito> they did have a proper sized bench for her at the four lords intro
[3:18:56] <+VoytekBus> she's like gandolf at the shire
[3:18:56] <%TheMattman1313> Wait isn't Rose like 14 lbs? What if she's going to be as big as Lady D?
[3:18:56] <%Deft_Thought> It's like your problem but the reverse
[3:18:57] <ammobasket> making do
[3:18:57] <%PettyFunk> Heisenberg commented on her continually growing didn‚Äôt he
[3:18:57] <+Caridinn> pat wouldn't you become big if you could
[3:18:58] <Srthunda> I guess those who dont age also do not get hip or joint pain
[3:18:58] <user_naim> So does this game have a lot of enemy shooting gameplay, or is it more walking simulatory?
[3:18:58] <Giztech> maybe she likes bending over LUL LUL LUL
[3:18:58] <+CatsEyeBlind> Think it's weirder that the castle as giant gaping holes in the walls
[3:18:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> at some point you get kinda used to things being too small though
[3:18:59] <ReaversEdge45> She gotta bigger from eating all those dark souls man
[3:19:00] <+ALazo> look pat, renovating a haunted mansion is a bitch and a half
[3:19:00] <rudiciuscaesar> maybe she wasn't always so large, maybe it's a side effect, as she "ages" she continues to increase in size
[3:19:00] <%walternatorz> her size is representative of the number of souls she possesses. duh
[3:19:01] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Yeah the builders didn‚Äôt think big lady would be running it
[3:19:03] <%sporeian94> Wait was that the spencer manner logo back there!?
[3:19:05] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt this economy...anything that is available is open to buy
[3:19:05] <TheFramedWarlock> Making a castle to scale would cost a ton of money
[3:19:07] <+Rekinsinn> Probably troublesome for people who aren't that tall if you build it that way
[3:19:07] <%sporeian94> On the door
[3:19:10] <%Garthunox> didnt Heisenburg say something like "why dont you keep growing?"
[3:19:11] <%skizzuto> Ethan is breathing so heavily all the time
[3:19:12] <+mitchyb603> shes gotta pull a shaq
[3:19:16] <%Ranryu692> I'm 6'3 and I've had to lean over through every castle doorway I've ever been through
[3:19:16] <dukenux> Pierce Brosnan was her ex-husband
[3:19:17] <MechanizedGentleman> being massive is her kink, dude
[3:19:19] <clloudberry> You're missing the treasure map
[3:19:20] <%AllenDeadman> maybe a shiny somehwere?
[3:19:21] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> she drinks a LOOOOt of blood. her diet most be great
[3:19:29] <NewWillinium> @Garthunox He did yeah
[3:19:30] <$floralkami> I think she's the only really tall person, tho
[3:19:31] <+FlongBongle> It‚Äôs fine
[3:19:31] <+LandOfTheWay> he's had a rough week
[3:19:33] <kazadaz> he got crucified like 10 minutes ago
[3:19:34] <Leeroy_Saber> Keep your sanity by looking at your family
[3:19:35] <+KaijuUltimax> Ethan is having a perpetual panic attack
[3:19:35] <doc_ock_rokc> Think of all the pain he is in
[3:19:36] <%amused_platypus> ethan wait dont go toward those milkers, we need the sample for claire.
[3:19:37] <%walternatorz> look for jewels?
[3:19:41] <+Thunder_Poo> Ethan is full of holes
[3:19:43] <GhostRavens> all things considered, ethan's handling all this pretty well
[3:19:44] <+Hyphixsys> Ethan hasn't worked out in a while
[3:19:45] <+ArtsyFoxo> Ethan deserves a long vacation
[3:19:46] <%dankgerald> I too would be greedily absorbing oxygen
[3:19:46] <%acridpaladin> he does keep getting horribly harmed
[3:19:47] <vaso1313> On the ground by table
[3:19:49] <%legendscar01> slash everything pat
[3:19:49] <Khorneflakes_> It must be very taxing for him
[3:19:50] <akitanito> sounds like an understatement

[3:34:14] <+pabloelenano2> she wasnt the smartest
[3:34:14] <+flipman107> was it the sunlight or the coldness that killed her?
[3:34:14] <Giztech> it no light but the cold

[3:34:17] <+LandOfTheWay> Ethan: "Chill out, lady."
[3:34:18] <%sporeian94> It's not the sunlight it's the snow, the snow kills them
[3:34:18] <+chiazam> She was my favorite one
[3:34:18] <Teyaric> Is it the sun, or the COLD, tho?
[3:34:18] <Clundy> She has the white calcification syndrome from nicer LUL
[3:34:18] <AngryAsian5> She was THAT horny LUL
[3:34:18] <EASrake> why are they dropping JO Crystals
[3:34:18] <%nicoleymcquack> lady d gonna rip your dick off for that
[3:34:18] <%EbolaBeetle> I was about to say
[3:34:19] <%SeaReally> also hubris I guess
[3:34:20] <akitanito> no one said they were smart
[3:34:20] <Zantetzuken> that's how the game scripted it
[3:34:20] <%walternatorz> maybe it was a timed encounter and she was dead no matter what?
[3:34:21] <BaekTheHeck> wow they are VERY generous with the ammo here
[3:34:21] <%Piemono> Why do they have so many windows
[3:34:23] <+ShudMirelurk> Brains aren't her super power atpRtsd
[3:34:23] <%Broand> So she die by frost then?
[3:34:23] <NewWillinium> Oh I'm so confused.
[3:34:24] <Mortal_Wombat_I> This makes no sense but is super cool
[3:34:24] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> she was horny therefore dumb
[3:34:24] <+kojibeoulve> why would they live in eastern europe if they're weak too cold
[3:34:24] <%Nekros4442> Thats like barely any light
[3:34:25] <mattdaddyd101> Boo on more lady
[3:34:25] <%EbolaBeetle> maybe it's the cold air
[3:34:25] <%The_Protagonist> why does... air kill her is the real question?
[3:34:25] <%Albadabar> She was the unstable one I bet
[3:34:26] <+BurgundyStrikerRaz> holy shit a BOSS fight? Daaaaaaaaaaaaamn
[3:34:27] <Teras_ode> nice cool anime figure for killing hot goth vampire lady
[3:34:27] <%Garthunox> the crystalization again...

[3:34:30] <MyNameIsRasus> wow crazy goth chick was a jobber
[3:34:31] <$floralkami> she couldn't use her powers to shift out
[3:34:31] <Treyu000> one down three to go
[3:34:31] <$StormingRLP> @PatStaresAt I think its more than Sunlight that kils them. The air from outside seems to have more of an effect on them.
[3:34:32] <Reook1> She hates the cold
[3:34:32] <MrFriendlyDude> can you add the spinel with the crystal torso? like re4?
[3:34:32] <+archangel9889> @PatStaresAt because the sun made her loose her power so she couldn't get out?
[3:34:32] <+chiazam> Go back for ITEM
[3:34:32] <dragoon001914> Now you can go back to check for the missing items :D
[3:34:33] <%AllenDeadman> so was it the sunlight or was it the cold that killed her?

[3:34:34] <+KaijuUltimax> Please don't let this be an indicator of future bosses
[3:34:35] <%AllenDeadman> I don;t get it
[3:34:36] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt could you have popped the other window?
[3:34:36] <+MrJerples> didnt think youd break the window i guess
[3:34:38] <%0rond> I don't think it was sunlight, looks like the cold
[3:34:38] <%baka_sugoi> baka_sugoi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! ayyy who would win in a fight Big lady or Big Boulder?
[3:34:40] <TriadOrion> ....Are they vulnerable to cold...?
[3:34:40] <PanicSwytch> She died like Jack?
[3:34:42] <iosephe> oh shit a crystal skull
[3:34:42] <+Zfglx> So that is just in his backpack now.   Neat.
[3:34:43] <jbmay> j mean, think of it from her view. she has had a pretty long win streak.
[3:34:43] <%solracc25> Mold > Bugs
[3:34:43] <mannywatcha> is that her torso?
[3:34:44] <tanarath> She was a 62 year old vampire, she was arrogant as hell
[3:34:45] <MechanizedGentleman> CRYSTAL BOOBA
[3:34:46] <Gelphaze> I guess not cold resistant lol.
[3:34:46] <+paladinstarbuster> Vampire hubris
[3:34:46] <%BoxNavy> look at that cool
[3:34:46] <NewWillinium> How is Ethan Carrying this shit?
[3:34:47] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt shoot the window for test purpose
[3:34:47] <dan_g_v> so, Bloodborne?
[3:34:47] <trianglehat> crystal booba
[3:34:48] <$dalmek> looks like Evil Within 2
[3:34:48] <Hellarussian> they're allergic to the outside, like me
[3:34:48] <+Delenay> zoe mold
[3:34:49] <sothatsprettybrutal> i'm a torso heap
[3:34:49] <%walternatorz> is that... to scale?
[3:34:50] <Qsmash_> just a whole torso
[3:34:50] <%bassoontyphoon> @PatStaresAt In actual vampire mythos, sunlight doesn't kill them. Only makes them able to be harmed
[3:34:51] <Hydrapissed> get that for paige rl with the skull
[3:34:52] <James_Quivers> @PatStaresAt It looks like Zoes crystals
[3:34:52] <GravyLangley> cool heh
[3:34:52] <BeezusHrist> That boss fight kind of... SUCKED
[3:34:52] <%causewaybob> Boss one down?
[3:34:52] <%livlinn> cold suck?
[3:34:53] <UberKingKai> Oh that‚Äôs metal
[3:34:53] <+BurgundyStrikerRaz> do they go together?
[3:34:53] <CappuccinoGuil> @TriadOrion sunlight
[3:34:54] <Siconia> Why does this crystal stuff remind me of Zoe?
[3:34:54] <akitanito> wait a second, you're selling her remains
[3:34:54] <dinnydanny777> Is that the monster from RE6
[3:34:55] <randomahole> crystal rack! PogChamp
[3:34:55] <+Mrbaconator> indiana jones movie
[3:34:57] <%Kief_Meister> @NewWillinium How are you confused? literally not that hard.
[3:35:00] <Ravioli_Ronin> their power is vitimin D deficiency
[3:35:00] <+Delenay> the crystal from 7 zoe
[3:35:02] <%Danger_Beans> they diddnt get the memo that Ethan has done this before.
[3:35:02] <alroy900> i mean, locusts are not very good in winter so...
[3:35:03] <%BoxNavy> remember when zoe crystalized ü§î
[3:35:05] <clloudberry> can you go back to the previous area?
[3:35:05] <AthenaAegis> Crystal remains. Hmmmm....
[3:35:06] <CALLthaDoctah> wow that vampire was an idiot
[3:35:06] <%shadoke> Alcina,
[3:35:06] <MyNameIsRasus> that looks suspiciosly like a dead Baker
[3:35:08] <greencapps> how long till someone makes a sex toy replica
[3:35:08] <SmolBluGhost> i cant tell if the wind got her or the sun did? or cold? im lost
[3:35:09] <cardamomo88> ONE DOWN 3 LETF
[3:35:09] <Crystallux> cold probably has something to do with whatever virusthey have
[3:35:09] <%garbageheaphound> can you go back?
[3:35:12] <+FlongBongle> Windows have plot armor LUL
[3:35:14] <%chiluzza> you only damaged her when she was in front of the broekn window
[3:35:14] <%iShouldBeAtWorklol> crystal booba
[3:35:14] <+Ran196> go back and find the items you missed
[3:35:14] <+ChaosAethr> they cant take the cold
[3:35:15] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, it looked like the cold temp made her corporeal
[3:35:15] <blue8moon> you can go back down and search for stuff too
[3:35:16] <mannywatcha> Wait why did that window shatter like that when ethan shot it?
[3:35:18] <BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt Where Paige?
[3:35:19] <%snow_bush> Explore that back area!
[3:35:20] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Can you combine treasures in this one?
[3:35:20] <Hellarussian> yeah
[3:35:20] <Saltmeisterr> Go back pat
[3:35:20] <%sporeian94> Imagine how pissed the other sisters are gonna be
[3:35:22] <+chiazam> So was that Ingrid?
[3:35:23] <%Kief_Meister> This game is awesome
[3:35:23] <%Albadabar> So it's Twilight rules that vampires are more or less made of crystal bullshit, but they die instead of sparkle in light
[3:35:24] <%justacrow84> into the jar it goes then
[3:35:24] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Hey, remember what Zoe looked like at the DLC? So yeah... cool crystals, huh?
[3:35:25] <EASrake> meat
[3:35:25] <%hrbeck_> this was a cutscene window
[3:35:26] <+Fenris_Alexius> pretty good yeah
[3:35:26] <Khorneflakes_> Thus far
[3:35:26] <%0rond> looks like the cold did it rather than the sun
[3:35:26] <%AllenDeadman> for now yeah
[3:35:27] <+EmptyPenguin> can you go back down to see if you got everything?
[3:35:27] <Tisaric> yeah it's pretty great
[3:35:28] <Dr_Mooose> its pretty
[3:35:30] <+Totally_Not_Toby> yeah we're fuckin schmovin
[3:35:31] <critiquequartz> OH GOD THE MOLD NEO UMBRELLA used was based off of this shit that‚Äôs why Zoe crystallized
[3:35:32] <SomeAsianDood> go back and search?
[3:35:34] <missingangle> I'm impressed so far
[3:35:34] <kazadaz> oh sweet
[3:35:34] <LunarRemix> Don't you think it's going a little too fast?
[3:35:34] <Deko_> yeah game doent stop
[3:35:35] <Dr_Mooose> *pretty good
[3:35:36] <rudiciuscaesar> Paige is off on an adventure, clearly.
[3:35:36] <%NoHopeForMyCuirass> really? Feels way too fast IMO
[3:35:37] <+paladinstarbuster> this room makes me unfomfortable
[3:35:37] <Tisaric> I wasn't going to watch much but I'm too drawn in now
[3:35:37] <+chiazam> @PatStaresAt Did you miss any items back there?
[3:35:38] <%skizzuto> backtrack to wallscrape for items?
[3:35:38] <Hydrapissed> I mean kinda killed a daughter pretty easily idk
[3:35:40] <xeros720> yeah, the few last rooms were real good
[3:35:40] <%baka_sugoi> nice
[3:35:43] <%genepark> Yep
[3:35:43] <NeroInfinite> Weak to cold LUL
[3:35:45] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Also it seems like the crystal fragments are leftovers of whatever weird biomutant shit is going on?
[3:35:50] <penitentpendant> Loot that boss arena
[3:35:52] <%nicoleymcquack> it's nice, not too long on between the big bads but they're not too often
[3:35:53] <kazadaz> what if she respawned right now
[3:35:55] <NewWillinium> @Kief_Meister Why did a Vampire freeze from the Cold Air?  Is it because Bugs and the Cold?  But Lady Demestrecu was outside earlier during the meeting.   Why did that work?
[3:35:56] <TheBlankAce> Very appreciative that there are no brakes
[3:35:57] <%iShouldBeAtWorklol> has to be good paced with 5 bosses
[3:35:58] <MyNameIsRasus> @critiquequartz that sounds correct
[3:36:00] <%NoHopeForMyCuirass> @LunarRemix Yeah, feels like 5 hours to end at this rate LUL
[3:36:03] <%Kief_Meister> @Hydrapissed Yeah but she was literally depowered
[3:36:04] <EASrake> ah
[3:36:07] <ZE_Count> my family
[3:36:14] <%hrbeck_> they got a lot of boss capital to throw at you
[3:36:15] <neodeluxe_> Gotta get back here later i guess, metroidvania style
[3:36:16] <trianglehat> makes sense
[3:36:16] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> vampire ladies ain't got shit on the baker family
[3:36:17] <penitentpendant> Fair enough
[3:36:17] <jbmay> so it's not sunlight, it's the cold?
[3:36:18] <NewWillinium> The game feels VERY fast. Like there's not a lot of tension.
[3:36:18] <+krispen_wa> So is this where Mia got the evil bio child from in RE7?
[3:36:18] <%bassoontyphoon> family family family
[3:36:18] <akitanito> if dead vampires become crystals, is umbrella corps just debeers?
[3:36:21] <%The_Protagonist> fambily
[3:36:21] <BeezusHrist> @LunarRemix Wouldn't be odd for a RE game
[3:36:25] <dinnydanny777> Why would you live in a snowy mountain castle in eastern Europe if you don't like the cold
[3:36:27] <AbysmalWulf> sleeby pubby
[3:36:30] <%Kief_Meister> @NewWillinium well do flies survive in extreme cold? no? think more then not bro
[3:36:32] <%0rond> you know it's a bit weird that there are no photos of ethan in that album, even this family photo doesn't include him
[3:36:38] <kazadaz> it's cause he knows he's safe from the vampires
[3:36:38] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> FAKE BRICK WALL
[3:36:39] <NewWillinium> Jack Baker would have given these Vampires so many knees
[3:36:43] <+BurgundyStrikerRaz> How long has Pat been playing?

[3:46:09] <+Delenay> that happened to the girl in the past, in the demo. not ethan
[3:46:10] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> yeah lady D don't care about cold
[3:46:10] <+spottedwolf10> They want to steal your hoodie!
[3:46:11] <%TheMattman1313> Maybe they got ghost-phobic after getrting to the castle
[3:46:11] <xeros720> BUT PATTUH
[3:46:11] <+Vampireinarm> W*men
[3:46:12] <%Kief_Meister> WHY WOULD THEY FIGHT A GUY NAMED ETHAN WINTERS??? THEY ALREADY SET THEMSELVES UP FOR FAILURE
[3:46:12] <notsoy> maybe the bug ladies hate the cold but lady D is fine with it
[3:46:13] <%JoshManVGH> Then why was Lady D unphased by the cold?
[3:46:13] <+bluestbee> Lady D is a Tyrant though not whatever her daughters are
[3:46:13] <+FlongBongle> women don‚Äôt like cold just like real life
[3:46:13] <+omega_reddu> Wcwomen
[3:46:14] <%AllenDeadman> yeah because, the previous room was dark as shit, but you could still kill the bitch
[3:46:15] <vVAstrAVv> they DO crystalize so maybe theyre freezing
[3:46:16] <Shadooper> bugs cant be cold
[3:46:17] <Kyle_sc> bug pokemon are weak to ice
[3:46:17] <Teras_ode> what a boss arena
[3:46:17] <%nicoleymcquack> I too do not go outside until its summer
[3:46:17] <Qsmash_> Not like they can leave, it's snow outside.
[3:46:17] <Siconia> These hoes foolish
[3:46:17] <Crystallux> lady d isnt the same as the daughters
[3:46:18] <+michingmallecho> They're really thirsty and Hangry
[3:46:18] <%i_chevalier> make sense. bugs hate the cold
[3:46:18] <%jorniev> I MEAN there are not any casltes in the tropic as far as i know
[3:46:19] <blue8moon> tbf if people aren't shooting them and they keep the windows closed, it's not actually a problem
[3:46:20] <%Monkeyweed21> bugs are weak to cold
[3:46:20] <+Ran196> should've move to greece and do their vampiring there
[3:46:21] <%BoxNavy> why would they live here
[3:46:22] <+LandOfTheWay> i thought they crystalized, not froze
[3:46:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> i mean what bugs like cold?
[3:46:24] <kazadaz> oh i don't want to order a glass of blood, i'll just have some of yours
[3:46:25] <Gorgs7> Hey Pat, maybe examine those wooden statues. Hiding another lockpick inside one seems like something they would do @PatStaresAt
[3:46:26] <AthenaAegis> Bug Type Kappa
[3:46:26] <Hellarussian> the scary door
[3:46:27] <+superkeaton> @SomeAsianDood She crumbled, just like the lady baker did, and turned to crystal
[3:46:27] <doc_ock_rokc> Evil? AWESOME

[3:46:30] <+CursedNobleman> EVERY VILLAIN. IS. LEMONS.
[3:46:31] <rudiciuscaesar> wow, Castle Volkihar here
[3:46:31] <+hairyboi1> Why would you ever live in a castle if cold can kill you? The amount of upkeep on fireplaces alone would be insane
[3:46:31] <+Fenris_Alexius> more regal than evil
[3:46:32] <GrayBrook> evil door or paladin door?
[3:46:32] <AegisREDflector> If they moved to like, Hawaii, would they be invincible?
[3:46:32] <PartyFavors> I mean, if Mother Miranda created them, they may not have had a CHOICE in where they live?
[3:46:34] <42nfl19> Why does pat refuse to pop the windows? He should test it to see it that was one time cutscene only.
[3:46:37] <+DukeDaisuke> As someone who lives in in a state with actual winter can confirm that bugs hate cold
[3:46:38] <+paladinstarbuster> oh shit his man IS WINTERS LUL
[3:46:38] <Oxybe> @patstaresat  your fiance drank poison. don't underestimate a woman's ability to surprise you
[3:46:40] <%MaxeusTheFirst> @PatStaresAt This is why women steal our hoodies.
[3:46:40] <%jorniev> GREEK VAPIRES?
[3:46:41] <+InhumanMilitia> how did ethan loss his fingers?
[3:46:41] <+michingmallecho> A resident door of evikt
[3:46:44] <Brother_Coduss> Didnt zoey also crystalize?
[3:46:46] <hat_under_bread> Hey Pat. Have enough people told you that bugs hate to cold?
[3:46:46] <%jtdobyns> isnt that the flower symbol from 5?
[3:46:47] <akitanito> soap would probably kill them pretty hard as well
[3:46:48] <%BoxNavy> lady d please buy a space heater for your daughters
[3:46:48] <MyNameIsRasus> why do these bitches not live in like equador or something
[3:46:49] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> game just begging you to craft
[3:46:49] <NewWillinium> In Fairness maybe the Vampires used to live in actual Romania and not Fake Capcom Romania.
[3:46:51] <+archangel9889> What if they arent vampires but giants mosquitoes
[3:46:51] <ChungusQuest> poor Kurlan Naiskos
[3:46:53] <+krispen_wa> why did mother miranda create women weak to ice then?
[3:46:53] <%amused_platypus> would paige attempt to defeat the vampires... yes
[3:46:54] <+MrJerples> WOMEN HATE THE COLD IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE
[3:46:55] <HellishLancer> sunlight turned her into calcium
[3:46:55] <%CzeekyTV> knife?
[3:46:55] <+chiazam> Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[3:46:56] <munitalprats> Pat its one bullet
[3:47:01] <kazadaz> Information is a resource
[3:47:01] <blue8moon> not all windows can be broken
[3:47:02] <+Cinnerennic> damn this atmosphere is toop nortch
[3:47:03] <SomeAsianDood> @superkeaton I don't mean when she died. I mean when the cold air hit her she had frost effects on her
[3:47:03] <%hrbeck_> @InhumanMilitia werewol

[3:47:19] <Kyle_sc> let Pat keep his ethers if he wants to
[3:47:20] <trianglehat> MOMMY
[3:47:20] <+chiazam> @PatStaresAt I think the witches are the successes, and the monsters in the cellar are the failures
[3:47:20] <%RonaldMcDownload> maybe the cutscene was instructional?
[3:47:21] <rudiciuscaesar> the knife obliterates wooden crates like they're nothing
[3:47:21] <%Eaglestrike117> couldnt you knife the windows>
[3:47:21] <fuji_92> YO THE WINTERS WILL KILL THEM, SO THEY WEAK TO COLD LUL

[3:55:30] <NireFuster> Nice reload animation
[3:55:35] <%legendscar01> are they praying to handgun ammo?
[3:55:38] <%TheLakinessMonster> If you block while you hold the knife, can that negate damage from swords?
[3:55:39] <BumblyMako> do they have to be headshots?
[3:55:40] <Isphone555> One of my favorite tropes in games is when gun sounds different when you hit.
[3:55:43] <+chaumiester> sooooo..... why does Ethan not know how to ADS?
[3:55:43] <vVAstrAVv> cant u knife those?
[3:55:48] <%amused_platypus> ethans shoes are ruined
[3:55:55] <SpellCatty> I wonder what it smells like here
[3:55:58] <Kabaaltheraven> This game seems really well made thus far, just damn XD
[3:55:58] <NireFuster> they have SWORDS?
[3:56:00] <+PlushMines> I feel like Ethan should upgrade his knife to one of those giant battle axes?
[3:56:01] <+Fenris_Alexius> clean
[3:56:02] <Scamsy> nice shots
[3:56:04] <xeros720> nice shooting
[3:56:04] <NewWillinium> Ethan! Pick up the swords!

[3:56:07] <kazadaz> sure shot, sure to make a body drop
[3:56:08] <Hydrapissed> ya think hed be used to it
[3:56:09] <Hellarussian> I would flip my shit too

[3:56:16] <brainflint> the mold gave him asthma
[3:56:16] <Treyu000> he's not leon or chris

[3:56:18] <%bassoontyphoon> So why can't Ethan just pick up one of the swords??
[3:56:19] <%Aeoneth> I mean the man just shat himself, give him a break
[3:56:19] <crimsonharvest> fighting for you life is hard work
[3:56:19] <kazadaz> illusory wall?

[3:56:21] <WhatIfDragon> that's just the infection setting in
[3:56:21] <%JoshManVGH> Shit is harrowing!
[3:56:21] <+BurgundyStrikerRaz> Ethan's like "BRO LET ME LIVE"
[3:56:22] <Kyle_sc> Ethans Day Out
[3:56:22] <+FlongBongle> A big life
[3:56:23] <%solracc25> psaBig tiffosBangBang
[3:56:24] <Psyramics> illusory wall?
[3:56:24] <MyNameIsRasus> probably his second worst day ever
[3:56:24] <sweatch0> ethan's big day out
[3:56:25] <+paladinstarbuster> hes just hungery
[3:56:26] <ItsPastas> he ain't got his inhaler on hand dude

[3:56:29] <+StonerStan101> Well Pat killing someone gets you really tired.
[3:56:29] <rudiciuscaesar> hey, did they say how old Ethan and Mia actually are at the time of the games?
[3:56:31] <%legendscar01> Prompt on the right
[3:56:32] <Mysticnamja> the cultists had spiked ball maces
[3:56:33] <dimensaur> big day ethan
[3:56:33] <GhostRavens> the least chris could do for ethan is buy him a coffee or something jeez
[3:56:34] <NireFuster> Ethan's big adventure
[3:56:34] <%dekkitout> This has been a significant inconvenience to Ethan's weekend
[3:56:35] <+jimmyjams1688> @chaumiester becauce the mold gave him crosshair vision. it's like daring a dot on your monitor
[3:56:35] <+michingmallecho> Ethan's no good, very bad day
[3:56:36] <WillofGame> Just curious, have you seen Invincible?
[3:56:36] <olm46> He's suffering from big woman withdrawal
[3:56:36] <%Aeoneth> His shoes are red and his pants brown
[3:56:36] <Khorneflakes_> FeelsBadMan still has recovered with what happened with RE7 and then Mia, then this
[3:56:37] <munitalprats> so when's ethan gonna use his wesker powers that he probably has
[3:56:37] <ssks123> there was an interaction on that bookcase i think
[3:56:39] <%Teintstein> Resident Evil 8: Ethan‚Äôs Big Day Out
[3:56:39] <SomeAsianDood> probably in his top 5 worst days
[3:56:39] <%Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt Lmao he really aint Leon or Chris "I made it as a general of the army as a 15 year old boy" Redfield
[3:56:39] <+PlushMines> Honestly "Ethan has a Big Day" is why I like him so much as an RE protag
[3:56:39] <+brigiethebaguette> it looks amazing
[3:56:41] <+FlongBongle> @suckerpunchsyd FUCK you‚Äôre right
[3:56:41] <+DukeDaisuke> @PatStaresAt His day is almost as big as these ladies

[3:56:47] <Dio_TR> ETHAN BIZARRE ADVENTURE
[3:56:47] <Oxybe> Sloshing through this bloodflood also is probably pretty draining
[3:56:47] <count_bob> It's to move a book case.
[3:56:48] <NewWillinium> I Ethan is like. . . Early 30s?
[3:56:49] <BumblyMako> the biggest break from reality is ethan's will to live
[3:56:53] <fuji_92> check for illusory walls pat, hit em
[3:56:53] <%logoth_> Is this Woolie's basement?
[3:56:53] <kazadaz> What did that Hold prompt do?

[4:00:56] <jbmay> I have a theory about the end.... I think maybe rose aged super quickly kind of like how moldy girl from re7....
[4:00:56] <Psyramics> is that why it's called Resident Evil, cause we're always in some evil house?
[4:00:56] <kazadaz> they kinda skimped on the ceiling here
[4:00:57] <+krispen_wa> this is ps5? it looks like a late ps4 game. And i mean that as a complement to late ps4

[4:06:05] <blue8moon> ethan's the real vampire, since he has no reflection
[4:06:05] <Psyramics> or the mirror isn't backed with silver, that's why vampires can't use them
[4:06:05] <%MandMGrease> She's like Michael Morbius.

[4:14:19] <%Kief_Meister> YOU'RE ALL SO DUMB. DID YOU NOT PAY ATTENTION TO RE7
[4:14:19] <akitanito> ethan is probably not wearing clothes
[4:14:19] <%DedlokPM> People going WTF right now are forgetting that he LITERALLY REATTACHED HIS LEFT HAND IN RE7
[4:14:20] <%Huntercd> He's had both hands cut off
[4:14:21] <balthazar758> Logan Winters
[4:14:21] <%charp35> Getting infected with the mold seems to only have benefits at this point
[4:14:21] <Grennold> moldy clothers DansGame
[4:14:21] <%solracc25> But then the fingers

[4:14:32] <DoctorDotDJ> nice
[4:14:34] <jbmay> at this point you cant tell me Ethan isnt just a fucking BUNCH OF SEVERED PARTS.
[4:14:34] <%acridpaladin> Ehats the girl with super healing in re6? i guess surviving the virus in general must give megahealing abilities
[4:14:34] <+chiazam> REPOPULATED
[4:14:35] <%Kief_Meister> @DedlokPM AND HIS LEFT LEG
[4:14:37] <+gitgouda> yep good ol hand works like brand new
[4:14:37] <BeezusHrist> HE HAS CONTROL OF HIS THE NERVES IN HIS HANDS AGAIN YA'LL @PatStaresAt
[4:14:38] <CappuccinoGuil> @Kief_Meister IT HEALED THE JACKET
[4:14:38] <+StraySheep28> we've seen him do this before multiple times idk why ppl are freaking out
[4:14:38] <devanmuse> i mean, this is actually the THIRD time he's reattached a severed limb
[4:14:40] <+SouLucha> What happens if you leave your hand?!
[4:14:41] <+TMulharin> Why are there Dark Souls 3 hollows here?\
[4:14:41] <%Kief_Meister> Y'ALL ARE DUMB
[4:14:42] <akitanito> people are going wtf over his clothes reattaching
[4:14:46] <%sunsetdisc0> this man put himself back together like he was a lego man
[4:14:46] <MavMedic81> No rest
[4:14:46] <reonome> @ZeOrbling she isn't she just has a small vision cone
[4:14:46] <@SoFarFetched> @ZeOrbling he was making a joke because he's peeking above the window while she's a few feeet away
[4:14:46] <dinnydanny777> Why did Ethan never heal his other hand
[4:14:47] <Kabaaltheraven> Ethan is Mold Venom
[4:14:48] <stiffybiro> drip never dies, jacket‚Äôs good as new
[4:14:50] <mar_krow> but is ethan healing better than sherry
[4:14:53] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Center Mass
[4:14:53] <+FlongBongle> So is Lady Dimitrescu the Mr. X of this game?
[4:14:54] <LoneFonte> @Kief_Meister tbh, the crazy part is straight up confirming it
[4:14:55] <radix865> Headshot has the crit chance I guess
[4:14:56] <Khorneflakes_> @ZeOrbling he was joking, because in the cutscene she could clearly see you
[4:14:57] <randomahole> did everybody forget that that happened in RE7, too (his leg)
[4:14:57] <+hung_tu_long_fong> bail
[4:14:57] <%Kief_Meister> @CappuccinoGuil AND THE PANT LEG IN RE7. YOUR POINT???
[4:14:58] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> knife them to save ammo?
[4:14:58] <%BrazenMask> that jerk had a crystal skull
[4:14:59] <+xmaydayx1> Ethan is the real DNA cure for everything . Seems to be the only sane person with the mold infection
[4:15:00] <KingSpunf> I wish these dudes spoke Romanian at you...
[4:15:02] <BeezusHrist> RE is dead to me....
[4:15:02] <doc_ock_rokc> @devanmuse but for the first time its his dominate hand
[4:15:03] <islandsunn> did he slip
[4:15:03] <Crystallux> i can see quite a bit of chat hasnt played RE7
[4:15:04] <%Frost_Quill> @ZeOrbling I don't know if she's actually blind.  There was a scene where she should have been able to see Ethan but didn't.  Wasn't clear if it was intentional.
[4:15:09] <%ZeOrbling> ohh lmao thanks chat
[4:15:09] <%walternatorz> are they just dropping from the sky?
[4:15:09] <jbmay> he didnt heal his other hand cuz the monster ate his fingers
[4:15:09] <+ChaosAethr> So ethan has experienced BOTH HANDS being severed
[4:15:11] <willsin4fun> we've seen it heal him; not his clothes
[4:15:12] <%Kief_Meister> @LoneFonte its already confirmed in 7 tf
[4:15:13] <mar_krow> sherry or ethan in healing
[4:15:14] <%templar010> Sirs. Excuse me.
[4:15:15] <EdeninShambles> 1 bullet difference
[4:15:15] <%DedlokPM> @randomahole and his left hand
[4:15:15] <Isphone555> Imagine dying to the sword goblin after escaping Mommy
[4:15:16] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> never mind more than one
[4:15:18] <$floralkami> i wish it didn't fix the jacket, but that would be a whole nother model to program
[4:15:20] <Meta_Four> Didn't the werewolf eat his fingers, and that's why Ethan's left hand is still messed up?
[4:15:20] <+gitgouda> @BeezusHrist but legs.
[4:15:21] <TheMadBadger> @DedlokPM I mean, he was knocked out for his hand in 7 so you could maybe hand wave away that it took a while to attach and only did because of staples. But the leg and his right hand you can't
[4:15:21] <amymist> @dinnydanny777 he might need the severed part, which in that case, was inside a werewolf
[4:15:24] <+rbakervv> @dinnydanny777 cause the lycan ATE his fingers, nothing to reattach
[4:15:29] <%acridpaladin> sherry took a massive plane chunk through her chest and healed it off with nothing. ethan still needed medicine to regen that
[4:15:32] <@SoFarFetched> @Frost_Quill she's definitely not blind if we literally just had that chase scene and she easily grabbed you a few times LUL
[4:15:36] <BeezusHrist> @Crystallux we've played RE7... that was fucking ridiculous even considering RE7
[4:15:37] <ATentacleMonster> poor Ethan deserves a dub :(
[4:15:37] <willsin4fun> then again ,maybe it did with his leg just wasnt as in your face with it lmao
[4:15:38] <NoirePanzer> NoirePanzer subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Hey Pat! Been loving the content for years and have fun with RE8.
[4:15:40] <CappuccinoGuil> @Kief_Meister Legit don't remember that, can you even see your legs in that game? Here it's more noticeable because you're seeing his hands constantly
[4:15:40] <%SpcOpsBear> Dimitrescu may just be near-sighted
[4:15:41] <%Kief_Meister> @TheMadBadger YOU CAN THOUGH
[4:15:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> I like how RE has turned from a zombie horror game to a bio horror game.
[4:15:47] <+Cinnerennic> did Pat ever play Days Gone on stream? like to see his thoughts on the hordes
[4:15:52] <hexen_emma> I think they're just infinite spawning
[4:15:53] <%Albadabar> infinite spawners?
[4:15:57] <vilecrois> Are they infinitely spawning?
[4:15:58] <NireFuster> Was that a quick turn around just now?
[4:16:02] <%Frost_Quill> @SoFarFetched Might be able to track using superhuman senses, but yeah it doesn't seem like she's blind.
[4:16:04] <%Piemono> whoops
[4:16:06] <NireFuster> Does the game have a quick turnaround input?
[4:16:08] <shutupyouprick> you can just leave yknow
[4:16:09] <+paladinstarbuster> I cant wait for you to find the lycan that ate your fingers later. its gonna happen
[4:16:09] <%ejackalope> you might not be able to cler this area
[4:16:10] <%Kief_Meister> @CappuccinoGuil Look it up after the stream, Ethan loses his leg, he uses the juice and boom. leg and pant reattached
[4:16:10] <+liquidzr0> this is an infinite spawn area
[4:16:10] <sirrice77> @Cinnerennic no he thinks that game is poo poo
[4:16:11] <Teras_ode> blue doors on map can be opened or are they ones that are opened already?
[4:16:11] <%LysdexicAndVolingit> @NireFuster Yep
[4:16:11] <+PlushMines> Dude that's 400 romanian bucks
[4:16:12] <%solracc25> Ethan steal some fingers and stick em to you

[4:16:32] <+krispen_wa> i can't believe the game called Biohazard has bio horror
[4:16:33] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Infinite spawning with item drops???

[4:17:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> I choose not to comment any further on the nature of RE games because it has been brought to my attention that my opinion is stupid.
[4:17:46] <+krispen_wa> if Ethan has like a mold arm that reattaches and shit, cant he shape it into like a razor or something if he wants?
[4:17:46] <%sporeian94> EAT THE LIPSTICK

[4:17:50] <munitalprats> Why did they BUILD THE CASTLE DOORS TO BE TOO SMALL FOR HER
[4:17:50] <BeezusHrist> Maybe keep the sleeve cut off so it isn't as rdiculous... That would require a new asset, but I guess just be lazy
[4:17:53] <%Albadabar> "It is blood, and therefore very poggers"
[4:17:55] <Samurai_Tchan> @CappuccinoGuil but ethan looks very completed there

[4:22:21] <+PBJammy> vampire thralls
[4:22:21] <James_Quivers> Other daughter candidates
[4:22:21] <KingSpunf> it's their pet simps
[4:22:22] <$Teh_Un> Ghouls were probably the maids
[4:22:22] <%AllenDeadman> probably failed experiments?
[4:22:23] <+Kyma1020> The maids
[4:22:24] <IminyourBase> pat ignores shiny

[4:22:40] <Parapattern> Just liven up your castle with some Ghouls
[4:22:41] <%amused_platypus> they are part of the aesthetic

[4:23:06] <%Valdorick> Imagine not hoarding for the inevitable mega ammo
[4:23:09] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> craft when getting close to a boss fight sounds more efficient
[4:23:14] <%Monkeyweed21> @EbolaBeetle she does say alot of general misandry
[4:23:16] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt they said book room shiny, I don't know what that means

[4:23:54] <%NoHopeForMyCuirass> It's going by SUPER fast IMO
[4:23:55] <CappuccinoGuil> The upside of hoarding mats is that mats don't occupy inventory space.
[4:23:57] <NewWillinium> It *feels* faster paced then RE7
[4:23:57] <+KaijuUltimax> Plus Mercenaries exists and has it's own chunk of game
[4:23:59] <+wah_ha_ha> Does Ethan like have Nanomachines?
[4:24:00] <Khorneflakes_> Hopefully the other areas are chunky
[4:24:00] <+HollowedIdjit> !uptime

[4:24:04] <lazerscraper> SUPER CHUNKy
[4:24:04] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> IT HAS REPLAY VALUE!
[4:24:04] <+Vigonept> Fallout now?
[4:24:04] <BaekTheHeck> people dont understand the concept of replaying games
[4:24:04] <MrRavine> People who complain about the length are weirdos who are used to 10s of hours of grinding and backtracking
[4:24:05] <+JDMH> yeah this is feeling longer than 7
[4:24:10] <uncle_speeps> people just don't know that re games are short

[4:24:25] <%MaxeusTheFirst> @PatStaresAt  Will the final boss be Jeff Goldbloom from the Fly?
[4:24:25] <%Valdorick> 50f is SUPER LOW
[4:24:25] <xeros720> i mean, it's probably stll 10 hours, but it all seems good
[4:24:26] <Samurai_Tchan> man I HAD A DREAM WITH VAMPIRES TODAY ,thats why now.

[4:24:36] <+pupil31> LOL
[4:24:37] <LoreKeeper_Thal> people act like every game has to have jrpg amount of time or something, it feels chunky enough for a RE game

[4:45:11] <+kojibeoulve> capacity matters
[4:45:11] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Is it somewhat confirmed that there is not treasure combination like the old games?
[4:45:13] <zenith0111> Damage and fire rate
[4:45:14] <Sigma_190_Beta> Extended mag might be fine.
[4:45:15] <%ejackalope> cap could be useful
[4:45:16] <tanarath> save cash
[4:45:17] <+Fenris_Alexius> you have money so may as well
[4:45:18] <dragoon001914> But more bullets means less time reloading
[4:45:18] <%garbageheaphound> the rate of fire is for shotgun

[4:45:25] <crimsonharvest> Reload speed is probably worth it
[4:45:27] <%Monkeyweed21> Extended Mag seems good
[4:45:28] <Meekest> you can combine treasures

[4:53:16] <$sarah_galb> the way the bats move reminds me of a house of the dead game and i dont know why
[4:53:18] <42nfl19> It feels weird how you can just kill all three sisters whenever, like they aren't even a designated boss fight. Well except maybe the first one.

[4:55:29] <$floralkami> @steinsapprentice bout 3hrs
[4:55:29] <pilllowofbees> chat why would you test a sniper on something that dies in three?
[4:55:30] <%X2Eliah> !uptime
[4:55:36] <$floralkami> WELL
[4:55:43] <+condemned_15> maybe the treasure map applies to this area?
[4:55:46] <CALLthaDoctah> @SteinsApprentice 5 hours. You can see a time counter next to the view count üëç
[4:55:47] <+bluestbee> 4 hours because the first hour is only talking
[4:55:50] <%Kief_Meister> @pilllowofbees Cause chat doesnt think <3
[4:55:55] <Kombatant_zero> cool area
[4:55:56] <neodeluxe_> @pilllowofbees To see how strong the sniper rifle is, get a good baseline
[4:55:57] <$floralkami> it felt like less, tho
[4:56:08] <%SteinsApprentice> yo 3 hours in looks good
[4:56:08] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> what a dumb gargoyle
[4:56:11] <+NightNiix> @bluestbee did he rush? quite far from start already
[4:56:19] <$floralkami> @callthadoctah not on mobile
[4:56:24] <%fortheboyzs> fortheboyzs subscribed with Prime. 
[4:56:26] <Parapattern> Hmmm. That reload isn't chunky enough
[4:56:32] <%Kief_Meister> @NightNiix No actually, he took his time lol
[4:56:35] <+TheHotStuven> its been awhile, no rushing here
[4:56:35] <%X2Eliah> @bluestbee Not rushing, but he is a pro gamer
[4:56:39] <doc_ock_rokc> @NightNiix no its just shorter then most REs so far
[4:56:40] <%Sirtimbob> Sirtimbob subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Pat, hope you‚Äôre having fun with BIg Steppy
[4:56:46] <NireFuster> I feel like this game has a more horror vibe yeah I like it
[4:56:48] <+NightNiix> @Kief_Meister whats lol about
[4:56:49] <wasdsf> it feels like castle cainhurst
[4:56:49] <%Valdorick> But where's the Lady D fart music?
[4:56:50] <akitanito> I don't see how the sniper is useful considering the range you are usually fighting in
[4:56:51] <+FlongBongle> It‚Äôs like 1 and 4 combined
[4:56:59] <KaiserMario> I don't hear clown's farting tho LUL
[4:56:59] <pilllowofbees> but it dies in three bullets anyway, its like testing if a ant will die to a hand grenade LUL
[4:56:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Alas, if only they brought back that great basement theme
[4:57:00] <CaptHat211> Pat is beating VTUBERS Zentreya and Snuffy in viewers. Pat > Waifus

[5:27:20] <+D00msDayDan> THE BLOODLINE
[5:27:27] <akitanito> is that repeating dialogue
[5:27:28] <%PettyFunk> Some kind of poison dagger somewhere but it seems like a secret
[5:27:28] <Dirtboar1> she mad
[5:27:29] <+xtkxyz> uh oh
[5:27:30] <%luftraumm1> is this just hauke manor?
[5:27:31] <%RedMageRebel> I love the look of the Lemi, the CZ Rami is always a good looking gun
[5:27:32] <Chimeraelite> We can fix that :)
[5:27:34] <+FlongBongle> She should be faster now
[5:27:35] <Dio_TR> THE BLOODLINE
[5:27:35] <%Kief_Meister> big lady angy
[5:27:35] <+Thunder_Poo> ... you need to continue the bloodline
[5:27:37] <%Arweynn> she needs more dialogue

[5:27:52] <NireFuster> ETHAN, I NEED YOU TO CONTINUE THE DIMITRESCU BLOODLINE
[5:27:55] <dinnydanny777> Her bloodline ends with her
[5:27:58] <%RetroCop87> use your knife on the shelfs?
[5:27:59] <%GarbageNirvana> You should introduce her to your good friend Chris Redfield, they'd have a lot to talk about I bet
[5:28:03] <%PettyFunk> Bloodline of House Redfield va Bloodline of House Dimitrescu
[5:28:04] <urmom467> open ceiling
[5:28:08] <+FlongBongle> @nirefuster LUL
[5:28:09] <rudiciuscaesar> fit all those babies in that thing *slaps roof of car*
[5:28:10] <iosephe> at the very least, she needs more repeatable dialogue
[5:28:15] <cardamomo88> LUL LUL
[5:28:16] <%RedMageRebel> how long till the SFM/Blender crew gets a hold of her
[5:28:20] <%hairyboi1> Armoire defeated
[5:28:21] <%RedMageRebel> I give it two more days
[5:28:24] <Ramenheim> There was a pipebomb wall in the blood dungeon iirc.
[5:28:25] <Sigma_190_Beta> Maybe you need to pull the switch and look up @PatStaresAt
[5:28:28] <%MaxeusTheFirst> *Images of Chris punching a boulder.*
[5:28:29] <%SilvaChariot0133> think they already did
[5:28:29] <Link232> Those some BIG bullets
[5:28:34] <@SoFarFetched> They already have Dimitrescu's model
[5:28:35] <+Katohearts> Model is already out
[5:28:35] <%Kief_Meister> @RedMageRebel I give it 12 hours
[5:28:40] <brachydios777> @redmagerebel Now
[5:28:40] <NireFuster> Yeah pat, she's PISSED now
[5:28:41] <+TomServal> She's already ported.
[5:28:44] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> one playthrough and already rich
[5:28:48] <WhatIfDragon> Her tallness makes her immune to the cold
[5:28:48] <%TheLakinessMonster> they already have, now they are setting the scenes
[5:28:50] <%Deft_Thought> The Dimitrescu Everywhere system
[5:28:51] <Jolly_Adventurer> @RedMageRebel She already has a model in SFM
[5:28:51] <akitanito> this is her home
[5:28:52] <cardamomo88> MAD
[5:28:53] <%RedMageRebel> well damn, shows what I know
[5:28:53] <casualbaloth> it's her house, Pat. she can go were ever she wants
[5:28:54] <@SoFarFetched> @Kief_Meister its been a thing for  days already,people were making mods with the dimistrecu model
[5:28:56] <42nfl19> ITS THE BIG TITTY EVERYWHERE SYSTEM
[5:28:58] <MyNameIsRasus> she's not affected by the cold because she's not bugs
[5:29:02] <dinnydanny777> She's so tall
[5:29:03] <xeros720> this feels like she's on maximum stalking mode since all her daughters are dead
[5:29:03] <PinoProxie> how dare you underestimate mommy
[5:29:04] <Jaysky> As opposed to the fake pursuers
[5:29:07] <Teras_ode> LUL
[5:29:08] <%DedlokPM> @RedMageRebel She already has a source model as of a few days ago/like shortly after the Demo hit pc on saturday
[5:29:09] <+pupil31> LUL
[5:29:09] <smugjorgen98> @RedMageRebel I thought they already have
[5:29:09] <+FlongBongle> LUL
[5:29:11] <+xtkxyz> trademark that shit
[5:29:11] <+epoladia> Of course she can go anywhere, it‚Äôs HER HOUSE, Pat
[5:29:13] <Dr_Mooose> they might
[5:29:14] <%Kief_Meister> @SoFarFetched Well shit never mind lmao
[5:29:18] <+Pixel_Matt> LUL
[5:29:18] <+paladinstarbuster> the chinder
[5:29:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> Big Titty X Gonna Give It To Ya
[5:29:20] <mythrilcrafter> Ported for SFM, but her Blender model isn't fully made yet
[5:29:26] <+FlongBongle> ohhhh
[5:29:29] <+chaumiester> a Czech pistol, a French sniper rifle, and an American shotgun..... what's next I wonder
[5:29:30] <casualbaloth> sure
[5:29:31] <%Valdorick> Its not even a knife upgrade.
[5:29:31] <+superkeaton> that so?
[5:29:33] <DianaTheAscian> and if u don't?
[5:29:33] <+Thunder_Poo> NO!!!
[5:29:33] <%Cozy90> its the dagger they used to gank jesus
[5:29:34] <sothatsprettybrutal> that's less cool
[5:29:37] <%Ranryu692> yeah, that definitely sounds like something that will be on the critical path
[5:29:37] <ShiningAxis> if not, guns probably work better anyway
[5:29:39] <fuji_92> I don't think so dude, but we'll see
[5:29:40] <VirtuaRailith> Maybe you'll kill her in a chainsaw fight?
[5:29:41] <Rei_Dsoto> Pup just can't help himself.
[5:29:41] <NireFuster> She pronounces 'Dimitrescu' very weirdly
[5:29:45] <Teras_ode> look at that boss fight tower
[5:29:45] <+Thunder_Poo> Don't do it!.. plz
[5:29:47] <NireFuster> Or maybe I don't know how to pronounce it
[5:29:50] <hewwogames> OR the item that forces her to go into sadler-mode and she has a big eye for a mouth or something
[5:29:52] <Vertigheist> let's bag this big bitch and move on
[5:29:52] <+transporterthesequel> Look at this boss fountain
[5:29:53] <Sigma_190_Beta> @Cozy90 Not the one to gank Ceasar?
[5:29:54] <+eanscrale> Ah yes the Shank of Longinus.
[5:29:54] <TimeFLip> @Cozy90 The Spear of Longinus
[5:29:55] <%Frost_Quill> But what if it's a missable weapon?
[5:29:55] <Melchior_the_Wise> @chaumiester hopefully a German Machine gun
[5:30:01] <Vermillion129> That looks like a boss arena
[5:30:03] <sweatch0> lets mamamia out of here
[5:30:03] <casualbaloth> :)
[5:30:03] <%pureinfection> this game has a great pace
[5:30:03] <glue_huffington> Ethan's got sticky fingers. all 8 of them.

[5:30:06] <trianglehat> here we go
[5:30:07] <cardamomo88> can we make him wife No4
[5:30:09] <+xtkxyz> maybe Ethan will turn off his pain inhibitors and become Jack The Ripper during the boss fight
[5:30:09] <lloyddboy> BIG LADY WORSHIP

[5:55:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @doc_ock_rokc ah makes sense then thanks
[5:55:24] <cherrycottontail> maybe the rose child at the start was fake? and the wife in on something? I don't understand this at all
[5:55:24] <+GrandmasterBFunk> @Chatterbox1991 I'm guessing the key part is that Rose has the ultra regeneration powers from the mould
[5:55:26] <mehfromBL> have fun piece your daughter back together
[5:55:26] <$Ziegsy> Is the name rose a thing from 7 or ya think its a play on rosemarys baby?

[5:56:26] <%RedMageRebel> I know 6 was bad but I hope they bring back sherry, she could train rose in weird healing powers
[5:56:26] <akitanito> someone was fast enough to do a nice sketch too
[5:56:30] <%Kief_Meister> @Chatterbox1991 No? he was blown up right???
[5:56:30] <dinnydanny777> She got Jenova'd

[5:57:10] <sullivansbizarreadventure> Oh no, we were too late to defeat the child!
[5:57:16] <%X2Eliah> So basically you will gradually unlock more and more of the village
[5:57:17] <johnatella> omg are they using Ethan to get all of the Rosemary parts, then swoop in and steal the parts???
[5:57:20] <%X2Eliah> right?

[5:57:20] <cardamomo88> HUMAN TRANSMUTACION
[5:57:24] <+TheBigTaco> Having this be Umbrella's origin kind of retroactively explains the weird obsession with marble statues and mansions

[5:57:32] <+Fenris_Alexius> @PatStaresAt Kinda hilarious that Max is gonna be playing this with his daughter who's less than a year old one room over

[5:57:42] <Chatterbox1991> @GrandmasterBFunk  the rocket launch Sheva and Chris use lop his head off right before detonation
[5:57:42] <%Frost_Quill> @johnatella Why do that if they already have all the parts?
[5:57:44] <Jolly_Adventurer> @NireFuster Chris killed Mia and abducted Ethan. The car Ethan was in crashed into this location. Ethan bumbled his way around looking for his daughter that they took
[5:57:45] <+krispen_wa> if we collect all the Baby parts, we can win the Steel Ball Run
[5:57:47] <cardamomo88> WHY CUT THE BABY?
[5:57:47] <pikapie> oh god
[5:57:50] <indig0bird> This game looks like such a bitch and a half to make
[5:57:51] <BumblyMako> @blank9 mold /fungi are metal organisms that can do crazy shit
[5:57:53] <naxanas1> @nirefuster uh... Basically, Ethan's wife gets killed and his baby daughter gets taken by Chris redfield. then Chris wakes up in the village, the demo plays out, generally that
[5:57:57] <Parapattern> Rose is probably just a sentient pile of fungus. She's fine.
[5:58:02] <Chatterbox1991> @Kief_Meister you can rewatch the scene; it's very fast

[6:01:53] <Fro5tburn> SourPls
[6:01:55] <NireFuster> I can't believe LadyD is dead and Pat sold it to the merchant
[6:02:00] <%RedMageRebel> I specifically didnt become an emt after being medic cause I didnt wanna deal with dead kids, that reveal got me good
[6:02:03] <%king_wragles> king_wragles subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[6:02:03] <KingSpunf> This is all very Silent Hill 1
[6:02:07] <BumblyMako> @pettyfunk that would explain their perfect english
[6:02:12] <Ramenheim> Shocked &  Enthralled.
[6:02:12] <brachydios777> This game really is gonna hit Max different with that reveal
[6:02:15] <naxanas1> @maenos2 who can blame you. theres sexy dragon ladies and babies in jars to stay up for
[6:02:19] <%Broken_Sonex> Yo but the Duke knows about that Lady D cake though
[6:02:25] <$Ziegsy> @Kief_Meister Jarred for flavour, canned for longevity. You want the nasty bits canned, and the tender meats jarred
[6:02:28] <cellaccount> dope
[6:02:28] <TheMostRadPanda> what percentage is the human body made of water
[6:02:30] <%thedankestmeeme> RELOAD!
[6:02:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Broken_Sonex everyone knows
[6:02:36] <%Kief_Meister> @RedMageRebel Yeesh, the reveal fucked me up too
[6:02:44] <%PettyFunk> @themostradpanda 100%
[6:02:49] <%Kief_Meister> @Ziegsy Noted good sir
[6:02:51] <%pettydoggerel> Aight imma hit the hay. Remember guys, jars are for baby food not babies. I blame Kojima
[6:03:09] <TheMostRadPanda> thats impossible, i'll never replace that with alcohol by midnight
[6:03:11] <%Kief_Meister> Goodnight, sleep well :D
[6:03:12] <Gorgs7> The real question is how did that jar get so dusty and old looking if Ethan got there relatively quickly, as we've been led to believe
[6:03:14] <%X2Eliah> Baby food is actually just babies
[6:03:26] <cardamomo88> nigh¬°¬°¬°
[6:03:27] <KingSpunf> Why does the jar look so old though? It looks like it's from the 40s...
[6:03:32] <Smokin_Fish> Help the baby
[6:03:35] <Lolaylaou> !uptime
[6:03:35] <@Moobot> @Lolaylaou I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 3m.
[6:03:41] <%AzureGale> BABY FOOD IS PEOPLE
[6:03:45] <$Ziegsy> Ethan keeps cracking jars to heal himself. Imagine, heat of the moment, he cracks open the wrong jar and pours that on his hand.
[6:03:46] <Tham1k> Jars can be old
[6:03:48] <Saltmeisterr> is stream ending?
[6:03:51] <%PettyFunk> It would be wild if we eventually see Chris and he‚Äôs Captain America elderly
[6:03:51] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Kojima-esque twists are coming I bet
[6:03:51] <naxanas1> @kingspunf right tho??? why does it look ancient?
[6:03:52] <pikapie> @KingSpunf maybe this is the original rosemary and she was cloned or something?
[6:03:56] <%Kief_Meister> @Gorgs7 everything is so weird, the humans were acting like all this shit happened 15 mins before everything started
[6:03:59] <%RedMageRebel> wait so eveline was e001
[6:04:01] <+FlongBongle> @saltmeisterr I don‚Äôt think so
[6:04:09] <$Ziegsy> what white suff wasnt dust, it was dead vamp crystal
[6:04:13] <%RedMageRebel> Rose is apparently e-3
[6:04:14] <amagenamesyasha> how far along is pat
[6:04:16] <%Kief_Meister> @RedMageRebel Yes
[6:04:16] <%RedMageRebel> whats E2
[6:04:19] <%EbolaBeetle> Ethan was probably out for 3 days
[6:04:25] <%Kief_Meister> uhhhhhh
[6:04:26] <%X2Eliah> ethan?
[6:04:26] <amagenamesyasha> I missed the beginning
[6:04:27] <%Kief_Meister> Lady D?
[6:04:27] <$Ziegsy> or ice if they kept it cold
[6:04:34] <amoistmilkman> Is the stream over?
[6:04:37] <%PettyFunk> @redmagerebel Mia maybe?
[6:04:38] <+FlongBongle> @amagenamesyasha killed first boss, 3 to go plus final I think?
[6:04:40] <%EbolaBeetle> 1/5 of the game through apparentyl
[6:04:43] <%X2Eliah> big over
[6:04:44] <+meth_damon1> Jank jonk bis
[6:04:45] <dinnydanny777> So did Chris help kill a child?
[6:04:45] <+A_Zealous_Retort> @gorgs7 jar may have used to be for EVE no.3 but they dumped that baby out, put the new one in and slapped a new label on if
[6:04:48] <MidnightPacif1c> SourPls
[6:04:51] <$Ziegsy> @amagenamesyasha 1/5 the way through
[6:04:53] <amoistmilkman> Thanks
[6:04:53] <%Kief_Meister> Streams not over everyone, Pats gotta help Elmo lol
[6:04:59] <Gorgs7> @Tham1k yeah, but not if they're being labeled for medical use, and remember the label saying it was his daughter was under the dust
[6:05:06] <Aji__> im pretty sure this is the longest RE ever
[6:05:07] <%EbolaBeetle> Help Elmo?
[6:05:09] <naxanas1> praying for elmo
[6:05:09] <BumblyMako> the jar can be old like everything else in the village. the bloody corpses ethan woke up around had red blood
[6:05:10] <KingSpunf> Why is the baby special again? Is it because Ethan's wife was fungus in RE7?
[6:05:11] <amoistmilkman> Thanks part 2
[6:05:15] <boogaleeboo> The severed baby head thing was a pretty big fucking twist
[6:05:16] <%impulse255dj> @amoistmilkman no, just an Elmo related emergency.
[6:05:17] <xeros720> Elmo needs help with the ganados i guess
[6:05:19] <%Kief_Meister> @Aji__ RE6
[6:05:24] <Gorgs7> @A_Zealous_Retort yeah, but the label saying it was his daughter was under the dust
[6:05:26] <%EbolaBeetle> Super Mold baby
[6:05:29] <$Ziegsy> Dont forget, mia knew something as well
[6:05:34] <+FlongBongle> MOLD BABY
[6:05:35] <Aji__> @Kief_Meister that doesnt exist
[6:05:37] <%RedMageRebel> @KingSpunf both and ethan and rose were infected, yeah
[6:05:39] <cardamomo88> MOLD MAN¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°
[6:05:44] <%Kief_Meister> Ehh Mia was very avoidant
[6:05:47] <doc_ock_rokc> @Gorgs7 Frost...it was frost
[6:05:51] <%RedMageRebel> I think the mold is just you gotta touch it and you're infected
[6:05:54] <42nfl19> people think mold baby, but can a parasite be genetic?
[6:05:59] <%EbolaBeetle> Mia was probably in the know
[6:06:06] <$Ziegsy> @Kief_Meister 'Im worried about you, ethan'
[6:06:07] <%X2Eliah> Honestly this mold infection deal sounds super sweet. You just become immotal for... no downside?
[6:06:07] <BumblyMako> @kingspunf ethan can also regen super fast probs to mold
[6:06:09] <%EbolaBeetle> It can be anything
[6:06:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @RedMageRebel remember ethan ate the Baker's food
[6:06:23] <%EbolaBeetle> Mind control Eve shit
[6:06:30] <doc_ock_rokc> @42nfl19 if the mother is infected there is a chance a baby can get the infection from the mother
[6:06:31] <%EbolaBeetle> and you may also become a moulded
[6:06:33] <%Kief_Meister> @Ziegsy Yeah cause dude kept bring up Louisiana when she didnt wanna talk about it
[6:06:33] <%EbolaBeetle> which sucks
[6:06:35] <+A_Zealous_Retort> @gorgs7 big pull: the snow is actually mold/spores from big baby powers so it coats the jar quickly and makes it look old
[6:06:36] <naxanas1> I mean, when a parasite has infected the mom, yeah maybe
[6:06:38] <$realm_forge> I‚Äôm willing to bet ethan‚Äôs daughter is actually safe with Chris and this is an entirely different rose
[6:06:39] <%Kief_Meister> Maybe at least lol
[6:06:46] <brachydios777> @x2eliah As long eve is dead so there‚Äôs no mind control
[6:06:46] <NireFuster> Does Gief bother Elmo?
[6:06:48] <%Monkeyweed21> @42nfl19 if crack can transfer from mother to child then so can a BOW
[6:06:50] <pikapie> BibleThump
[6:06:53] <%Broken_Sonex> But Eve is dead so no downsides anymore
[6:06:58] <doc_ock_rokc> thats cats and dogs

[6:33:41] <NireFuster> You're gonna be a billionaire anyways just upgrade it
[6:33:42] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt the old one is still better until you get the compensator equivalent
[6:33:43] <Wafflez1909> probs need to max them all anyway for super guns later on
[6:33:46] <+FlongBongle> lmao
[6:33:48] <OzdotTV> FOOD IS VITA
[6:33:50] <genmypoweralready> DO IT
[6:33:52] <genmypoweralready> TWO WORLD WARS
[6:33:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> There are reasons to max every weapon in post game
[6:33:55] <Psyramics> can you take the mods out?
[6:33:57] <%fortheboyzs> SALE IT
[6:33:58] <%LaughingCatt> dont sell it till you beat the game!
[6:34:00] <+FlongBongle> enemies respawn infinitely
[6:34:02] <+andreeg24> it will be the best handgun when fully maxed.  that's re rules
[6:34:05] <%Kief_Meister> How much longer is Pat gonna go?
[6:34:05] <%PettyFunk> @paperware just assume it looks like the food in RE7 :)
[6:34:06] <fuji_92> 150 + 30
[6:34:07] <tanarath> Pat, keep it.
[6:34:07] <Wafflez1909> never sell
[6:34:10] <Wafflez1909> never ever
[6:34:11] <blue8moon> current does more because of mods
[6:34:12] <neodeluxe_> It has slower reload speed and fire rate tho, but better bang for each bullet
[6:34:12] <%LaughingCatt> dont know what kind of upgrades youll find for either of em
[6:34:12] <A0N33> The compensator says it's adding 30 damage though, for 150+30
[6:34:14] <Link232> 160 versus 150+30
[6:34:16] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt old one says 150(+30)
[6:34:18] <cardamomo88> NEVER
[6:34:22] <TheMadBadger> Lemi is doing 150+30, M1911 is only doing 160
[6:34:24] <%Kief_Meister> Never ever sell
[6:34:28] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  and there's likely attachments too

[6:48:37] <+FlongBongle> 10 hours if you rush it
[6:48:41] <Vertigheist> they were probably evil chikens
[6:48:42] <BumblyMako> @phil_morg probably if you rush through without backtracking
[6:48:45] <+Kazekyou> He's doing the chicken a favor, they'd just starve to death
[6:48:45] <Zombrocom> It's ten hours if you just do the main line
[6:48:45] <pikapie> @kazadaz unknown, cant access it right now tho
[6:48:45] <fivecheezits> I had to bail on max stream he keeps dying poor guy
[6:48:47] <%Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt Like Omikron, you're halfway through the game

[6:48:53] <butcherbirb> @kazadaz castle is done and lady d is dead
[6:48:55] <heartlesshealer> 10 hours if you don't care about the game

[6:49:30] <+killer_squid1990> PIG
[6:49:34] <%RedMageRebel> I never get when people get mad at RE games for being "short". theyre not actually that short, and they've always been about 12 hours or so on a first run, longer if you dont know what youre doing
[6:49:34] <Hydrapissed> Massive PIG damage
[6:49:36] <+FlongBongle> D:

[6:50:01] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean pigs will eat anything
[6:50:02] <%RedMageRebel> thats bad words
[6:50:03] <RickSaintRiot> incredible pig assault mechanics in this game
[6:50:03] <kazadaz> ANOTHER dark soul
[6:50:11] <%Paperware> Wow this game has pig physics
[6:50:11] <butcherbirb> pig physics
[6:50:13] <+RogueCrocodile> Just like the prime minister
[6:50:17] <naxanas1> lockpick in the well??
[6:50:19] <susukouhai> do the pigs burrow away like crystal lizards
[6:50:20] <NireFuster> hows gief doing these days?
[6:50:23] <RickSaintRiot> when the pig attacks remember to roll
[6:50:25] <+poysendemon> Poor Max
[6:50:25] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  Maybe the critical path is easy to blitz once you know the order of puzzles and spec correctly?
[6:50:25] <heartlesshealer> he also baby
[6:50:26] <RickSaintRiot> and drop your shield
[6:50:27] <doc_ock_rokc> HALF HOLE
[6:50:36] <VirtuaRailith> Zangief will use his fat good to protect us from the fat evil
[6:50:41] <prhymes321> pat the puppet lady is best area
[6:50:47] <+RogueCrocodile> Why poor Max?
[6:50:56] <RickSaintRiot> pigs are the neutral versions of dogs
[6:50:59] <@SoFarFetched> use an ammo to get more ammo
[6:51:04] <%RedMageRebel> god of war bucket
[6:51:05] <%walternatorz> you don't store your ammo in bird cages?
[6:51:05] <casualbaloth> and now we know that yellow means "interact"
[6:51:13] <Phil_Morg> Im so weirded out that the Castle area was dealt with so fast
[6:51:15] <kazadaz> "Fat Evil" is such a weirdly durable meme
[6:51:19] <RickSaintRiot> yellow means piss
[6:51:22] <RickSaintRiot> Interact with the Snow
[6:51:23] <xeros720> someone raised that pet shotgun shell
[6:51:24] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt you can go all the way back to the first well now too
[6:51:26] <+zzNamttamzz> that inventory size is obscene
[6:51:27] <+FlongBongle> LUL

[6:51:37] <%takotoots> LUL
[6:51:51] <+FlongBongle> Did anyone clip Pat getting jumpscared btw
[6:51:55] <xbb1024> They really exaggerate how run down this village is
[6:51:56] <%GarbageNirvana> Still don't think she's completely dead
[6:51:57] <%Kief_Meister> Zangeif making me tired as shit
[6:51:58] <naxanas1> to be fair, I wouldn't have thought of jumping through a brick wall
[6:52:02] <%Kief_Meister> @FlongBongle Yes
[6:52:04] <%Kief_Meister> ***
[6:52:04] <Vertigheist> it's kinda funny and good at the same time that lady D was just the opening act and not that important
[6:52:11] <%The_Protagonist> you have the key for that door, don't you?
[6:52:18] <Ombrebird> I went to make dinner  2 hours ago and pat is still playing?!
[6:52:18] <NireFuster> i mean Pat sold her body
[6:52:22] <RickSaintRiot> A village that is more run down than I would expect from the age? how unrealistic
[6:52:23] <%Monkeyweed21> you can climb up the roof
[6:52:25] <RickSaintRiot> what were they THINKING
[6:52:27] <mehfromBL> Lady D is just the Mendez equivalent
[6:52:29] <BumblyMako> oooh. goat noise was gief snoring
[6:52:34] <neodeluxe_> Babayaga fucked us with that door
[6:52:46] <Phil_Morg> so how far up the sticks is this village in the first place? This shit looks UNTOUCHED by time
[6:52:46] <akitanito> is gief a collectible
[6:52:46] <@SoFarFetched> he da baby
[6:52:52] <monkeyp0wer> How long did it take you to finish Silent Hill 2? Also I've been playing alot of pyramid head in dbd and I'm loving him.
[6:52:55] <+FlongBongle> Lmao
[6:52:56] <Ombrebird> did milf mommy get killed?
[6:52:56] <RickSaintRiot> let's go
[6:53:03] <+FlongBongle> He woke up and then fell back asleep immediately
[6:53:07] <+FlongBongle> I‚Äôm jealous
[6:53:08] <ssks123> there was the well right outside the castle
[6:53:08] <neodeluxe_> @Ombrebird ye
[6:53:12] <Sigma_190_Beta> You're missing that other chest.
[6:53:16] <ssks123> but i dont know if you can get back there
[6:53:20] <graemecrackers2> Water wheel weapon is Bloodborne as fucj
[6:53:21] <BumblyMako> @xbb1024 to be fair, a lot of the village got fucked by werewolves
[6:53:24] <%Kief_Meister> Lady D is dead as fuck thank god
[6:53:25] <%PettyFunk> Well, well, well.
[6:53:30] <%Ascethetic> waterwheel on drawbridge?
[6:53:30] <Link232> Can you drawbridge with the well valve?
[6:53:32] <RickSaintRiot> milfs never die, they just go milfing in action
[6:53:32] <Hellarussian> hmm
[6:53:35] <%Drunkengen> Eventually
[6:53:35] <neodeluxe_> Probably later
[6:53:36] <Aji__> you are, but yes
[6:53:39] <@SoFarFetched> was castle completely finished? geefThink
[6:53:39] <%GarbageNirvana> The D is for dead
[6:53:42] <Phil_Morg> Pat youll get there once you fuck up another Lord
[6:53:47] <%ejackalope> turn right before drawbridge
[6:53:52] <PeacefullySunsetMe> I missed the beginning, can you restart the game? thanks
[6:53:52] <Vertigheist> @Kief_Meister hell yeah
[6:53:53] <fritz_dacat> gotta go back to get that knife im sure
[6:53:53] <%Ascethetic> other drawbridge
[6:53:54] <%TheMattman1313> That yellow rope next to the drawbridge might get used later
[6:54:01] <Trip_hop_on_pop> What is the Maestro's Collection?
[6:54:03] <TheBlankAce> Seems like something you do once you do the watery area
[6:54:05] <+jimmyjams1688> throw a pipe bomb in teh water there
[6:54:06] <Dr_Mooose> the water might drain later?
[6:54:08] <casualbaloth> did the rope go to something before you completed the castle?
[6:54:09] <Link232> Other drawbridge, the one you encountered on your way out
[6:54:12] <RickSaintRiot> I like the map
[6:54:13] <%Monkeyweed21> no the drawbridge past Duke
[6:54:19] <Phil_Morg> fuck up swamp thing
[6:54:22] <%GarbageNirvana> I like how people are giving advice on a game that's been out for two hours
[6:54:24] <RickSaintRiot> looks like a ttrpg map
[6:54:24] <%ejackalope> oof. i got thrown off by the symbols
[6:54:26] <Gorgs7> What's the random locked door in the graveyard?
[6:54:28] <Sigma_190_Beta> There's that other chest in that red room with a lockpick, can you get to that?
[6:54:31] <squeakyclarinet> He can't get there.
[6:54:38] <+transporterthesequel> From the other side where Pat exited the Castle yeah, there was a water wheel thing for the drawbridge I think
[6:54:42] <RickSaintRiot> can't get there from here
[6:54:44] <%Ascethetic> Pat is a series of wrong doors
[6:54:48] <GarettLefebvre> enough pig meat for another upgrade?
[6:54:53] <Ombrebird> RIP big DDDD's
[6:54:59] <naxanas1> resident evil 8: lost in village
[6:55:04] <critiquequartz> Does anyone else think duke is hella evil?
[6:55:04] <%Sirtimbob> Go BACK to the well before you saw the duke the first time
[6:55:07] <42nfl19> @GarbageNirvana They probably watched other playthroughs. Some have already been posted on youtube already

[6:55:42] <%Kief_Meister> NO COOKING ANIMATION? SHIT GAME/10
[6:55:48] <Link232> Can you submit the meats and store them or do you just have to lug them around
[6:55:53] <BumblyMako> duke is surprisingly likeable
[6:55:57] <ItsPastas> You need that quality meat, Pat
[6:56:05] <%Sirtimbob> Go BACK to the wheel well BEFORE YOU SAW DUKE IN THE ROSE JAR CUTSCENE
[6:56:05] <Phil_Morg> Duke is GREAT
[6:56:07] <+jimmyboomjenkins> I didn‚Äôt expect the duke to be so impactful to the story
[6:56:33] <heartlesshealer> with the way you fed father in that RE7 DLC mode I never expected any cooking animation at all
[6:56:34] <%walternatorz> there hasn't been a storage safe, has there?
[6:56:40] <xeros720> oh, you can turn them in? that's good
[6:56:46] <%Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt I still find it so weird that theres no item box
[6:56:49] <@SoFarFetched> just remember to feed Jack pepper Kappa
[6:56:58] <@SoFarFetched> just NOTHING but pepper
[6:57:00] <+FlongBongle> Merchant being part of the story is genius tbh
[6:57:06] <Phil_Morg> Imagine Duke and RE4 Merchant having a drink together
[6:57:10] <Leeroy_Saber> This dude has a new talent under each fat fold
[6:57:14] <NireFuster> briefcase
[6:57:14] <%Sirtimbob> Unless thats the drawbridge
[6:57:15] <heartlesshealer> you are box
[6:57:15] <%Monkeyweed21> yea he prolly has a fridge
[6:57:15] <Shin_goob> has pat met booba yet?
[6:57:15] <Phil_Morg> how does he even fucking MOVE
[6:57:20] <NeroInfinite> You ARE the item box
[6:57:24] <RickSaintRiot> the name is Romanian, apparently.
[6:57:26] <Psyramics> 4 didn't have storage either, right? this feels much more like a 4 than the others
[6:57:27] <%Kief_Meister> @Phil_Morg Wellll they are old friends according to Duke
[6:57:31] <+epoladia> @FlongBongle True!
[6:57:33] <NireFuster> @shin_goob Booba is dead
[6:57:35] <%X2Eliah> Man its gonna suck when Duke is mother miranda and you have to kill him
[6:57:36] <%Ascethetic> dang, worth a try
[6:57:36] <$Ziegsy> My baby girl is boofing in her sleep ;A;
[6:57:41] <cosmicgoatee> booba is over, we Lords of Cinder now
[6:57:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @Phil_Morg the power of Bio Fat

[6:58:00] <42nfl19> which one do you want to go to first?
[6:58:02] <Link232> Wait Luiza's Necklace is a key item not a valueable
[6:58:05] <RickSaintRiot> "Son of Dmitri"
[6:58:10] <Phil_Morg> Duke is the FAT GOOD
[6:58:15] <Blank9> she's just Mendez
[6:58:19] <NireFuster> Her second form was so hot Kreygasm
[6:58:22] <42nfl19> Was it implied you can go to any of the 3 or is there an order @PatStaresAt
[6:58:24] <%genepark> Yessss

[6:58:26] <+FlongBongle> @phil_morg LUL LUL
[6:58:29] <xeros720> yeah, everything is done really well so far, it's a real glowup from 7
[6:58:30] <neodeluxe_> She was a Dragon in a castle, it makes more sense the more i think about it
[6:58:31] <jbmay> yayyyyyy
[6:58:33] <oOZtkOo> vampire milf bio dragon was cool
[6:58:36] <Phil_Morg> Yeah Lady D's final form is like another worse RE game's final boss
[6:58:39] <@SoFarFetched> People saw Dimitrescu's "actual" form and went "JACKPOT"
[6:58:42] <Phil_Morg> her fight was high tier

[7:06:12] <Chatterbox1991> look at this obvious riff on the Guest House from RE1
[7:06:16] <Phil_Morg> 200% CURSED
[7:06:18] <SpellCatty> Is that a human shadow on the stairs?
[7:06:23] <+sevorai> Waaaait are the four lords gonna be different genres??????
[7:06:23] <RickSaintRiot> italian for wind is "vento," supposedly

[7:06:29] <vinceshamwowslap> fancy SeemsGood
[7:06:30] <gothhusband> get a load of this resident evil mansion
[7:06:30] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Does seeing Mia just there counts as a "Bio-ghost"?
[7:06:32] <+CourageTheCat> Cozy
[7:06:32] <Isphone555> How many trees died to make these floors walls and ceilings
[7:06:35] <+CourageTheCat> But spooky
[7:06:36] <+jimmyjams1688> first quater was all memes and boners
[7:06:39] <heartlesshealer> painting of person and doll
[7:06:45] <+Kungfuski> Shoot plates on wall
[7:06:45] <%Jeshk0> this house immediately makes me paranoid
[7:06:46] <oOZtkOo> BIOGHOST
[7:06:47] <%Cozy90> @couragethecat what?
[7:06:48] <naxanas1> are we gonna get a shiny yellow sweater here
[7:06:50] <%ejackalope> her house is much smaller than the castle
[7:06:50] <BlueLunecy> This is oddly mundane
[7:06:50] <santafer> damn I feel asleep. Did he already boss battled the big woman?
[7:06:52] <digimonda> can we burn that painting
[7:06:53] <42nfl19> oh fuck those eye paintings
[7:06:55] <+Kungfuski> may be like emblems
[7:06:57] <mrTittysprinkles> dont like that
[7:06:58] <RickSaintRiot> "oh it should be easier to learn a new romance language when you know one already" WRONG
[7:07:00] <%Kief_Meister> pretty horrifying HA
[7:07:01] <%RedMageRebel> look at that fucking Slappy doll
[7:07:02] <pikapie> @santafer yeah
[7:07:03] <NeroInfinite> Is this just the silent hills house?
[7:07:04] <ItsZelus> She kinda cute üò≥
[7:07:07] <Phil_Morg> like in RE7 with the different Baker slasher genres, each Lord is a different gothic horror thing
[7:07:07] <%Crookedspiral> oof, she made a new daughter when the old one died
[7:07:08] <vinceshamwowslap> DansGame
[7:07:08] <%Cozy90> o nvm
[7:07:08] <Psyramics> she died when she was 9, she never looked like that
[7:07:12] <RickSaintRiot> because of CONFUSING alMOST THE SAME WORD isms
[7:07:13] <Turtle_LiveTV> There was a goat outside the house near the side staircase.
[7:07:13] <Phil_Morg> i love it
[7:07:14] <heartlesshealer> yay RE Spin
[7:07:19] <GunEden> live ghost?
[7:07:20] <+A_Zealous_Retort> the puppeteer is the spider from the story in the beginning, the yellow rope is the golden thread
[7:07:22] <dinnydanny777> I'm scared
[7:07:22] <SmolBluGhost> im 100% convinced its probably the doll
[7:07:22] <+FlongBongle> ayo wtf is about to happen
[7:07:23] <Adahlenan> man this place has me on EDGE compared to the castle
[7:07:23] <%Frost_Quill> @santafer Killed her, and sold her corpse to a fat guy.  I'm not kidding.
[7:07:25] <twoto858> Like a doll house
[7:07:26] <%walternatorz> this is unsettling
[7:07:27] <Titaaaannss> @santafer Sadly, don't like she's the first boss
[7:07:29] <mrTittysprinkles> @Psyramics but did she
[7:07:29] <bignakeddogman> Looks way too old to be the one who died at 9 years old
[7:07:30] <%Kief_Meister> Anti climactic?
[7:07:30] <Joshguy55> @Psyramics oh shit
[7:07:32] <%blutzwavedave> If it wasn't filled with bioghosts it would be a pretty nice house
[7:07:34] <%jinking79> PT it
[7:07:35] <%The_Protagonist> maybe this zone has like nothing it it besides spoops and is way shorter than castle
[7:07:35] <StrrLion> it looks cozy even
[7:07:36] <xeros720> yeah, was just thinking that too, it's like someone actually lives here
[7:07:36] <+TheBitingIrish> He already was?
[7:07:38] <%R3Roundabout> finally
[7:07:40] <oozebear> it's gonna pop off in like two minutes

[7:07:53] <AegisREDflector> It feels like you're not suppose to be here yet. lol
[7:07:53] <Chatterbox1991> assume no bioghosts or vampires i would like to live in this house
[7:07:53] <@SoFarFetched> they said on the fence
[7:07:56] <MrRavine> Do we know how much longer stream might be? Deciding how much I can mess up my sleep schedule lol

[7:08:03] <%Buzzard42> where goat
[7:08:03] <heartlesshealer> I guess the only reason pat's not noticing these goats is because he can't play with headphones
[7:08:07] <mak0t0yukii> G O A T
[7:08:09] <naxanas1> this place actually feels cozy
[7:08:12] <Turtle_LiveTV> Just outside fence

[7:08:27] <@SoFarFetched> @MrRavine maybe one more hour or so? Pat's trying to find a good point to stop.
[7:08:28] <%AzureGale> Who leaves these ghosts lying around
[7:08:30] <Adahlenan> @MrRavine he said clean up and then end earlier but now we're here :)
[7:08:30] <KaiserMario> Pat, you have A LOT of bullets
[7:08:31] <Link232> God and you can't hear it because of the waterfall, that's kinda cheap
[7:08:33] <MrRavine> Gamefaqs to the rescue :)
[7:08:36] <SpectralTuna> Got the goat! Woo!
[7:08:36] <%Valdorick> For every eagle eye is a blind eye to balance.
[7:08:38] <dinnydanny777> This place is so spooky
[7:08:39] <BumblyMako> the outside is rougher than the inside
[7:08:39] <vinceshamwowslap> monkaW
[7:08:48] <%Maids4lyfe> can you interact with bed?
[7:08:49] <%Jeshk0> is ammo scarcity actually a thing in re8?

[7:08:50] <+FlongBongle> I‚Äôm sure nothing weird is gonna happen in this room
[7:08:52] <sandsim> this place feels scarier than vampire dragon castle
[7:08:54] <xbb1024> The important question, can you get fiber Internet in this house
[7:08:55] <%sniffy77> Im guessing pat likes the game
[7:08:58] <xeros720> some tasty apples
[7:08:59] <BumblyMako> @valdorick i am of the blind
[7:09:00] <+jimmyjams1688> this is creeping me out big time

[7:09:05] <%DedlokPM> @MrRavine he last said when he reacjes a save point

[7:52:56] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Try and inspect the doll? might have a clue to the treasure?
[7:53:03] <akitanito> guess it's better than them dropping from the trees
[7:53:03] <%condemned_15> zombies?! In MY Resident Evil?! Perish the thought!
[7:53:06] <no123450n> mere farmers with sickles buried right on the path

[7:53:45] <+billyrayjoebob> What's nuts is I went from taking literal days to download a 40gb game to doing it in 2 hours
[7:53:53] <RickSaintRiot> seems like a lot of those ground slashes are missing? or do they just not have a big bloody burst
[7:54:00] <+billyrayjoebob> Also can watch Netflix/whatever while said thing downloads
[7:54:04] <+billyrayjoebob> Superhype
[7:54:09] <%octavian_wolf> how is it so far, folks? I had to leave for my DnD game
[7:54:15] <%bread_assassin> Pat started off that section by saying he was gonna quit at the first save spot than proceeded to do the entire section. This game has him hooked.
[7:54:15] <naxanas1> for having combat training, Ethan just pokes the air with his knife
[7:54:20] <%TheMattman1313> CHeck the blue bird photo
[7:54:23] <akitanito> I think you can't hit OTGs with knife
[7:54:28] <NireFuster> I feel like you always have just enough ammo to deal with enemies, not a lot, but also not like 3 bullets

[7:54:32] <neodeluxe_> @octavian_wolf Looks pretty good so far
[7:54:34] <Blank9> @octavian_wolf 2nd area was wild
[7:54:37] <+TheHotStuven> @octavian_wolf great so far, 2nd part was pretty silly though
[7:54:38] <khailward> @octavian_wolf You missed some funky fetus shit.
[7:54:41] <Chatterbox1991> YO DUKE I SAW SOME SHIT
[7:54:45] <%TheWinged7> inspect the doll first people were saying
[7:54:50] <%octavian_wolf> shit, I missed so much!
[7:54:50] <NireFuster> @octavian_wolf really good so far
[7:54:54] <critiquequartz> 2nd area was spoopy
[7:54:56] <%TheMattman1313> Wider shot though
[7:54:57] <+PlushMines> kinda frustrating how much more health they're getting
[7:54:59] <akitanito> what about the cost of upgrading
[7:55:04] <%Uselesswhitenoise> inspect dolls before selling, everyone else keeps saying that
[7:55:07] <xeros720> the new shotty seems like it has more spread
[7:55:09] <%sniffy77> who has pat met?
[7:55:18] <+FlongBongle> ACTUALLY RICH
[7:55:22] <eco419> oof
[7:55:22] <%billyrayjoebob> what the fuck is the doll
[7:55:22] <RickSaintRiot> i have my doubts that this man is truly a duke of anything

[7:55:30] <%TheWinged7> RIP
[7:55:31] <dinnydanny777> Adorable?
[7:55:33] <lloyddboy> noooo necklace stone
[7:55:35] <NireFuster> Is 'lei' an actual coin?
[7:55:39] <akitanito> rolling dosh
[7:55:41] <TDAWS_MP132> beeg moni
[7:55:41] <penitentpendant> Wait... did that stone say 'necklace stone'?
[7:55:43] <NireFuster> Is it like some european coin?
[7:55:43] <%BrazenMask> did the necklace jem not go into the neckklace?
[7:55:46] <+FlongBongle> @sniffy77 dimitrescu and Angie
[7:55:47] <$Teh_Un> Could you have combined the Necklace stone with the Necklace?
[7:55:49] <akitanito> yes
[7:55:50] <TurranosOrn> power and ammo capacity
[7:55:51] <heartlesshealer> lei is real currency
[7:55:53] <neodeluxe_> Gotta go for the new weapons
[7:55:53] <TurranosOrn> more bullets in gun
[7:55:56] <TurranosOrn> less ammo in storage
[7:55:57] <prhymes321> Pat I think these lords already had their powers its just the baby has ampilified them
[7:55:59] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Necklace gem was for necklace wasn‚Äôt it?
[7:56:00] <%Frost_Quill> @penitentpendant It was in a necklace.
[7:56:02] <TurranosOrn> free up the cache space
[7:56:03] <%EbolaBeetle> Buy parts
[7:56:04] <RickSaintRiot> it's the plural of the Romanian leu
[7:56:05] <heartlesshealer> idk if it's in coins, but it is real
[7:56:05] <pipboy344> Romanian currency
[7:56:07] <tacoisgoods> rip to the complete necklace
[7:56:10] <Link232> New shotgun seems to be just better
[7:56:10] <doc_ock_rokc> @Teh_Un no different necklace
[7:56:14] <RickSaintRiot> *apparently*
[7:56:16] <+tetraes> buy its attachments?
[7:56:17] <Dehlome> 2nd shotgun looks better tho
[7:56:18] <Khorneflakes_> cohhHmm
[7:56:22] <+Rheyr> The 1911 is good
[7:56:22] <%Drunkengen> crazy talk
[7:56:26] <%Monkeyweed21> you dont have any attachments
[7:56:26] <%Ascethetic> check the shop for mods to the m1911
[7:56:27] <Aji__> This game is the re2 to re7 for sure
[7:56:28] <Isphone555> Renember what you taught me when I was a kid, Maximize STrenghts.
[7:56:29] <%EbolaBeetle> Pat just shat on the completed necklace
[7:56:29] <Blank9> but what if it gets real good LATER
[7:56:30] <Link232> Hold off on the 1911 until you find the compensator for it I'd say
[7:56:33] <%PettyFunk> It came from a necklace, but did he check to see if it could go in one of the slots of the other one?
[7:56:35] <+Rheyr> It seems like it gets crits more often
[7:56:35] <xeros720> if that new pistol gets some upgrade parts, it'll outpace it i'm sure, but who knows where they are
[7:56:36] <+A_Zealous_Retort> big rip to completing necklace for more money
[7:56:39] <+TheBitingIrish> The newer guns get more upgrade slots later
[7:56:43] <akitanito> that shotgun grip looks so tiny compared to the rest of the body
[7:56:46] <eco419> bye necklace
[7:56:48] <neodeluxe_> The LEMI has 2 addons tho, the m1911 has none yet.
[7:56:53] <%Kief_Meister> Aight, I'mma go to bed y'all. its late lmao.
[7:56:59] <Sol_Install> you have the funds tbh
[7:57:00] <blackjack8182> Looks cooler tho
[7:57:02] <%Kief_Meister> Goodnight chat, goodnight @PatStaresAt
[7:57:03] <mehfromBL> reduced sway for the sniper sounds good
[7:57:03] <TurranosOrn> sleep well!
[7:57:04] <heartlesshealer> necklace stone was not cylindrical, would not fit into necklace with holes
[7:57:05] <Chatterbox1991> Anything for the 1911?
[7:57:08] <neodeluxe_> @Kief_Meister good night!
[7:57:09] <Chaoko99> so I literally just got here is this RE4-2, first person

[7:57:13] <xeros720> yeah, i need some sleep too, have fun gunning
[7:57:15] <%billyrayjoebob> @PatStaresAt I watched yalls LP forever ago, should I play 7 before I get this? Seems like a modern RE4
[7:57:18] <Sigma_190_Beta> Oh, apparently there was a completed Necklace that you could have made. @PatStaresAt
[7:57:21] <%Kief_Meister> Night bois
[7:57:23] <NireFuster> @Arkantogonx the lady is dead
[7:57:24] <Aji__> @squidking96 hella godo
[7:57:27] <Aji__> Good
[7:57:30] <RickSaintRiot> knobby pistol grip
[7:57:42] <RickSaintRiot> or, wait, no what is that
[7:57:48] <Pat_Squared> those gems wouldnt have fit
[7:57:49] <%TheMattman1313> And maybe the "necklace jewels"?
[7:57:50] <blue8moon> the necklace stone wasn't a combinable
[7:57:54] <no123450n> two whole holes?
[7:57:54] <neodeluxe_> Looks like the parts are golden swords
[7:57:56] <Vermillion129> keep it for now?
[7:57:57] <fuji_92> you found one but sold
[7:57:59] <RickSaintRiot> same, bro, but i'm not married
[7:58:00] <reonome> chat duumb
[7:58:01] <%EbolaBeetle> Necklace stone?
[7:58:03] <Link232> The necklace gem he sold didn't have the combinable tag chat
[7:58:04] <+InhumanMilitia> sword blades
[7:58:06] <%sunsetdisc0> hehe pat said holes
[7:58:07] <spinningchurro> does this match up with VII in terms of quality?
[7:58:08] <neodeluxe_> Do it
[7:58:09] <Chatterbox1991> YES
[7:58:09] <+Rheyr> Yes
[7:58:11] <LordOfThePoultry> yes
[7:58:11] <+Rheyr> Do it
[7:58:11] <heartlesshealer> not necklace stone
[7:58:11] <+InhumanMilitia> nah
[7:58:12] <%The_Protagonist> your call
[7:58:12] <Dehlome> it doesnt seem worth it
[7:58:12] <critiquequartz> Yeah
[7:58:12] <NireFuster> I mean.... how's the damage tho?
[7:58:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The game tells you if an item is a combinable
[7:58:13] <+Gespens> the necklace stone that you just sold from Luiza's necklace?
[7:58:13] <+FlongBongle> Fuck it
[7:58:13] <Pat_Squared> looks like itll be swords or something
[7:58:13] <+pabloelenano2> nahnot yet
[7:58:13] <ZE_Count> Is game good Pat???
[7:58:15] <eco419> no
[7:58:16] <Khorneflakes_> Sure
[7:58:16] <akitanito> see how far you can upgrade first
[7:58:18] <+tetraes> sell old shotgun?
[7:58:19] <fuji_92> yeah
[7:58:20] <%Maids4lyfe> yeah
[7:58:20] <%RedMageRebel> nooo I like the lemi
[7:58:21] <+TheBitingIrish> The newer guns get more upgrade slots later
[7:58:21] <TurranosOrn> LEMI is more accurate but less damage
[7:58:24] <TurranosOrn> but always go with new hotness
[7:58:26] <%Cozy90> money
[7:58:27] <Blank9> 1911 is cool
[7:58:27] <RickSaintRiot> uhuhuhuhuhuh uhuhuhuhhuhuh you said "holes" uhuhuhu
[7:58:28] <GarettLefebvre> Sell the old upgrade the new
[7:58:28] <+WingBuffet> a 3rd pistol is certainly like 1 hour away
[7:58:29] <TurranosOrn> because damage = more bullet value
[7:58:30] <Aji__> @spinningchurro id say its way better no cap
[7:58:32] <+TheDeadpoolDash> commit to1911
[7:58:34] <%Frost_Quill> There's apparently a reason not to?
[7:58:37] <heartlesshealer> necklace stone was not a dagger-thematic decoration
[7:58:38] <Dr_Mooose> *finds new gun*
[7:58:38] <blackjack8182> 1911!
[7:58:39] <%DedlokPM> @EbolaBeetle necklace stone was from Inaria's Necklace Key Item and was not combineable
[7:58:40] <+bcom33> is it worth it to sell?
[7:58:42] <%EbolaBeetle> No
[7:58:46] <+TheHotStuven> Save for ng+ if there is?
[7:58:46] <%Monkeyweed21> no sell the old shotty
[7:58:46] <%Artyom1198> Big number

[7:59:18] <Link232> I'd mag up the pistol probably
[7:59:20] <penitentpendant> I await the vicious fight on reddit for which gun is best, then it'll TRULY be like RE4
[7:59:20] <NireFuster> Armed to the fucking TEETH
[7:59:21] <lloyddboy> you can buy them back!
[7:59:22] <TurranosOrn> SO MUCH SPACE

[7:59:32] <%Valdorick> And now Pat's going to walk into the next zone, and free, stronger out of the box sniper rifle will be in the open.

[8:00:11] <+Real_Hornet> @patstaresat shortcut the new guns
[8:00:11] <akitanito> better reload your guns before you forget
[8:00:12] <neodeluxe_> @PatStaresAt Shouldn't you upgrade magazine on the new pistol, it's only 7 bullets by magazine
[8:00:16] <%billyrayjoebob> Holy shit this game is only 28 GB? Looks amazing
[8:00:17] <cosmicgoatee> Pat with the tight end attache
[8:00:19] <Pat_Squared> to be fair a new weapon in re4 didnt always mean it was the better weapon
[8:00:26] <Wak033> we boutta cash out?
[8:00:26] <+Rheyr> max those upgrades son!
[8:00:29] <42nfl19> 9mm kills the body, 45 acp kills the soul. Don' want no lich coming back.
[8:00:33] <OverheadOctopuss> what difficulty?
[8:00:34] <akitanito> nice
[8:00:40] <+TheHotStuven> Free!
[8:00:40] <Drchandragupta> am I crazy or is there a single frame when changing weapons where ethan has two right hands
[8:00:41] <heartlesshealer> can't go wrong with ammo capacity
[8:00:42] <akitanito> normal
[8:00:42] <+rickelstiltskin> @42nfl19 exactly
[8:00:45] <NireFuster> Ethan's weapon switch animation is so funny, it's like he grows hands
[8:00:46] <HyperionXV> I think I saw some new recipes for sale
[8:00:46] <%Frost_Quill> What trick?
[8:00:50] <dan_g_v> where is the blue bird?
[8:00:51] <RickSaintRiot> gotta spend the money, can't hold it back. that's the RTS strat
[8:00:54] <NireFuster> @Drchandragupta just about to say that
[8:00:57] <heartlesshealer> yes, the double hand
[8:00:57] <+TheHotStuven> gave free ammo
[8:00:58] <Noogiez> shoot merchant
[8:00:58] <spinningchurro> 12 HOUR STREAM let‚Äôs gooooooo

[8:01:07] <%MajorCrasher> did you ever check the bird pic?
[8:01:08] <Scamsy> bird
[8:01:08] <RPG_CHICAGO> Great first night!
[8:01:10] <mehfromBL> @Frost_Quill upgrading ammo capacity refills mag
[8:01:12] <RickSaintRiot> birdy. birdy birdy birdy
[8:01:14] <Link232> @Frost_Quill If you upgrade the weapon capacity you get a free full mag
[8:01:15] <ChungusQuest> Holy crap, did everyone in here see the Biohazard Puppets video posted in the subreddit?
[8:01:18] <+TheBitingIrish> Yea, if you swap weapons real fast Ethan grows more hands
[8:01:18] <NireFuster> SHOOT BIRD
[8:01:18] <penitentpendant> May it be a lootiful bird
[8:01:23] <%ejackalope> so this game is definitely something, that is for sure
[8:01:24] <+RogueCrocodile> Why does it look like a different set of hands is rotating around
[8:01:33] <%ZeOrbling> has pat beat any more lords? i had to jump out after demitrescu
[8:01:40] <Sigma_190_Beta> @GarettLefebvre He has the four wing fetus bird actually.
[8:01:42] <Vermillion129> graveyards
[8:01:49] <RickSaintRiot> that bird is begging for some LEAD CRUMBS
[8:01:51] <genmypoweralready> How many times has Pat said he's going to call it a night
[8:01:54] <reonome> @ZeOrbling puppet lady
[8:01:56] <casualbaloth> @ZeOrbling he just beat the doll lady
[8:02:01] <pipboy344> he beat doll lady
[8:02:04] <Khorneflakes_> Time to try out the new pistol I guess
[8:02:05] <%ZeOrbling> ah damn, thanks tho
[8:02:08] <NireFuster> @genmypoweralready shhhh....
[8:02:10] <heartlesshealer> here comes everything to distract from bird because why not
[8:02:11] <42nfl19> THEY KNEW YOU WERE DOING PUZZLES lol
[8:02:18] <naxanas1> how dare they interrupt our bird watching
[8:02:38] <+Rheyr> Look left
[8:02:40] <heartlesshealer> Did stabbing make him get up faster????
[8:02:43] <penitentpendant> It should be on your left
[8:02:45] <Vermillion129> left
[8:02:47] <+Rheyr> in that little grave house thingie
[8:02:52] <Leeroy_Saber> Hold on, it looked like Ethan had three hands for a bit when Swapping from the Pistol to the Shotgun
[8:02:52] <@SoFarFetched> Id love give you the bird but the Fox Censors won't allow it geefSmug

[8:09:18] <MaritimeSpanker> you might get stuff to put in it thought
[8:09:18] <auraofdawn> i wonder if ethan will ever get his fingers back
[8:09:19] <neodeluxe_> Giant Crystal Axe sounds cool and all, but when is Ethan getting the Moonlight Greatsword?
[8:09:23] <+Kungfuski> Mr.Shakedown got infected with the G-Virus
[8:09:24] <%mostbrokenrobo> D O S H
[8:09:24] <%The_Protagonist> i assumed it'd be an optional super weapon or something
[8:09:25] <SmolBluGhost> its a whole 3 money
[8:09:27] <bigfookinrat> 30k
[8:09:28] <%Frost_Quill> Might be a combine thing?

[8:09:33] <+rathekingofthesun> Enough for 2 bean burritos
[8:09:42] <heartlesshealer> maybe you get it early because you'll need the extra when you find them...
[8:09:43] <%PettyFunk> @neodeluxe_ He would have had to cut off Lady D‚Äôs tail for that :(
[8:09:44] <RetributionP> I left the stream when pat said we were gonna go to the lighthouse. are we going to the light house?
[8:09:45] <%Drunkengen> 1.99
[8:09:46] <NireFuster> That's so much money
[8:09:47] <+Gespens> enough Real to buy the street light
[8:09:47] <%The_Protagonist> @Frost_Quill nah it'd say combinable
[8:09:48] <%Frost_Quill> Is the chalice a combine thing you can make more valuable?

[8:10:28] <heartlesshealer> okay
[8:10:28] <Dr_Mooose> ok ok
[8:10:31] <%billyrayjoebob> 30k buckaroos aint bad
[8:10:32] <%marsantas> 48K is nothing to sneeze at
[8:10:32] <%Valdorick> Oh okay, so if you just juke the boss and take the chalice, you get less money.
[8:10:35] <heartlesshealer> time to buy medicine
[8:10:37] <Sigma_190_Beta> Oh so you can buy back your weapons.
[8:10:39] <+TensecondTarvis> you can buy back guns too, sweet
[8:10:40] <Sigma_190_Beta> That's good.

[8:10:44] <doc_ock_rokc> what are the 3000 itmes
[8:10:47] <%PettyFunk> @neodeluxe_ Oh wait my mistake. Cutting off Lady D‚Äôs tail gives you the MOMlight Greatsword.

[8:13:53] <NireFuster> LUL
[8:13:54] <+FlongBongle> hahahaha
[8:13:56] <%blutzwavedave> LUL LUL
[8:13:58] <lloyddboy> LUL
[8:14:00] <$Futurecity10> I do sleep a lot
[8:14:01] <%MajorCrasher> LUL LUL LUL
[8:14:02] <%optimasmaximas> oh god that episode
[8:14:05] <%AzureGale> Goddamn that was a good joke
[8:14:06] <NireFuster> Big sleepies
[8:14:39] <%Monkeyweed21> If the Doll House went on as long as the castle it would have dragged the gimmick out too long
[8:14:54] <Swaron__> watch invincible, is gud
[8:14:54] <%RedMageRebel> @Monkeyweed21 yeah im glad it was shorter
[8:14:55] <NireFuster> Remember when Pat said he'd leave it tonight when he got to the doll house LUL
[8:15:01] <+A_Zealous_Retort> do we know what FF7 First Soldier is yet?
[8:15:05] <%RedMageRebel> games that do that for hours on end stop being scary
[8:15:14] <+TheOrange56> did he fight lady d yet?
[8:15:16] <%blutzwavedave> The momy has been milked :(
[8:15:16] <NireFuster> The doll house was very good, I'm glad it was that short
[8:15:19] <heartlesshealer> in Invincible, a lion lick face after [spoiler]. Enjoy strange new awakenings, chat
[8:15:27] <NireFuster> Now that I think about it, even Lady D section was very short before she died
[8:15:30] <@SoFarFetched> @A_Zealous_Retort a battle royale,it was shown in the trailer awhile back
[8:15:36] <NireFuster> Kinda crazy how Lady D was only the beginning of the game
[8:15:42] <+FlongBongle> LUL
[8:15:50] <The_SPHD> Managed to catch & watch the whole stream! Thanks for the years of entertainment, Pat! :D
[8:15:52] <Dr_Mooose> reasons
[8:15:57] <%muXPerience> It was the only way
[8:15:58] <NireFuster> Sometimes you gotta chop a baby you know LUL
[8:15:58] <Blank9> the bloodline
[8:15:58] <neodeluxe_> Maybe they stole the baby from chris
[8:16:01] <%optimasmaximas> not a hero
[8:16:02] <Khorneflakes_> Or participated in BABY MURDER
[8:16:02] <HeroToxiko> according to the marketing, he's a werewolf now
[8:16:02] <%Monkeyweed21> Lady D is totally coming back
[8:16:04] <@SoFarFetched> "IF I CANT CONTINUE THE REDFIELD BLOODLINE,NO ONE CAN CONTINUE THEIR BLOODLINE" - Chris
[8:16:05] <$Futurecity10> Please, that babies a fucking natural disaster
[8:16:06] <Blank9> it must continue
[8:16:06] <heartlesshealer> It wasn't his sister's baby
[8:16:06] <SpellCatty> "If Claire can't have one nobody can"
[8:16:09] <%VoidBaronJules> he be juicin' too long
[8:16:11] <+pkmamsters> Doll lady was made of rocks, maybe baby was a boulder
[8:16:11] <RetributionP> because he is "evil" now again
[8:16:14] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Wait did the baby turn into a crystal BEFORE or AFTER the chopping?
[8:16:18] <NireFuster> @Monkeyweed21 how though? Duke's got her body
[8:16:19] <$SuperiorDelta> Maybe he knew she was a potential Biohazard?
[8:16:20] <%optimasmaximas> NOT A HERO
[8:16:20] <nonoffensiveusernamee> WOULD U LET TALL LADY STOMP UR BALLS?!?!?
[8:16:21] <+Neon_Negro> misunderstood the meaning of split custody
[8:16:21] <rReizs> extract the essence to insert into claire
[8:16:31] <%AzureGale> wut
[8:16:37] <jumpyhugs> Smarch?
[8:16:40] <heartlesshealer> unlucky because sun???
[8:16:41] <SaphronBlackbourne> I thought it was Mother Miranda who did the chopping
[8:16:47] <%BrazenMask> i thought it was interesting that you get hints about Mia being up to bullshit and then getting chased by a monster baby in the dollhouse
[8:16:48] <+FlongBongle> 9 months pregnan
[8:16:50] <+FlongBongle> T
[8:17:02] <%AzureGale> Human birth baby in 9 month
[8:17:05] <%Monkeyweed21> the sub baby you impregnate us with
[8:17:07] <NireFuster> LUL
[8:17:19] <%Monkeyweed21> Like Shadow The Hedgehog and Spongebob
[8:17:27] <NireFuster> Not his day at all
[8:17:32] <%VoidBaronJules> old boy
[8:17:35] <Blank9> Saw movie
[8:17:37] <+FlongBongle> True
[8:17:40] <+FlongBongle> Old Boy
[8:17:47] <neodeluxe_> Calling it now, Chris wanted to study the baby to see if they could allow it to live but Mia was conspiring with Mother Miranda and got the baby stolen from new umbrella
[8:17:50] <Chatterbox1991> S H O O T T H E G L A S S
[8:18:37] <Chatterbox1991> HOW WILL THEY EXPLAIN THE MAGNETO SHIT???
[8:18:45] <nonoffensiveusernamee> how was Ethan not hard as a rock through this whole campaign
[8:19:02] <%Monkeyweed21> They just keep stretching the limit of bioweapon
[8:19:02] <Gorgs7> Is Chris the new Wesker?
[8:19:12] <%tizz86> @nonoffensiveusernamee too much blood loss
[8:19:14] <NireFuster> Sounds about right
[8:19:18] <NireFuster> LUL
[8:19:31] <%Monkeyweed21> He will reattach his legs or neck
[8:19:33] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[8:19:36] <@SoFarFetched> But pat has fishnets
[8:19:41] <@SoFarFetched> hes already got the outfit
[8:19:49] <paaadaawan> Stop yawing! It‚Äôs making me tired too
[8:19:51] <NireFuster> He's gonna stitch his halves back together
[8:19:55] <NireFuster> Put some herb water on that
[8:19:56] <%Monkeyweed21> put on the booty shorts for our tips
[8:20:06] <+pkmamsters> I miss Pat's Green Shirt + Khaki's character model
[8:20:22] <heartlesshealer> House was fucking great
[8:20:26] <neodeluxe_> @pkmamsters Don't forget the chinstrap
