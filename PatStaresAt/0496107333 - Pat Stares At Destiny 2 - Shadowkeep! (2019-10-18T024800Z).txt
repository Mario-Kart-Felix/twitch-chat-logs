[0:01:26] <Crankthulhu> Pat's getting King Crimson'd
[0:01:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Livestreaming donkey shows
[0:01:30] <+MrTickleTrunk> The STREAM dropped for a sec. not just frames

[0:01:46] <+MrTickleTrunk> I had a loading circle happen
[0:01:52] <@StridentSong> Tickle, I'm literally looking at the twitch stats. He dropped 103 frames to the twitch server
[0:01:57] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Is it Twitch that's freaking out?

[0:02:17] <+MrTickleTrunk> Yeah so its `00% on Twitch's side. gotcha
[0:02:18] <segbas2004> is it that time of the year that twitch shit itself for no reason?
[0:02:18] <WhereIsWill> maybe twitch just messing up today
[0:02:29] <valriot> Literally happens when you interact with certain players
[0:02:29] <+D00msDayDan> it's definitely your team
[0:02:30] <%Maids4lyfe> twitch is always shitting the bed
[0:02:31] <zv1neda> probably twitch
[0:02:32] <%GarbageNirvana> Are these considered peak hours?
[0:02:32] <+MrTickleTrunk> well there HAS been 'net attacks the past few days. hope its not that D:
[0:02:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think it's cause your destiny penis is too big for twitch
[0:02:35] <%Ranryu692> aw shit, I was rewatching Shitstorms and forgot to come hang out here
[0:02:36] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> They keep dropping your frames
[0:02:45] <lionmanguy> I'm not seeing anything. Do you gotta really know your video to notice or is it something else?

[0:08:49] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> with some weapons it's neat
[0:08:49] <+Pyroclase> chromatic fire is pretty great imo
[0:08:50] <%TaifuDragon> Not in PVP
[0:08:51] <%dekkitout> With Ace, you get explosions
[0:08:51] <%GarbageNirvana> It's good for PvE stuff
[0:08:51] <%Ninestempest> it's liek 3/5 for pve
[0:08:52] <+jyeowa> @AngriestPat has the potential to get collats but very rare case
[0:08:53] <%Maids4lyfe> dragonfly got buffed in pve
[0:08:54] <%Ninestempest> it's all right
[0:08:55] <startstoprepeat> it's neat with ace of spades
[0:08:59] <+Pyroclase> it's hilarious if you combine it witha ce of spades
[0:09:01] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> it triggers off Ace which is real good
[0:09:03] <+Pyroclase> everyone explodes twice
[0:09:05] <%Ninestempest> it's fun with ace of spades for double explosde
[0:09:08] <%dekkitout> Also Arbalest
[0:09:08] <Redmannasah> @MrTickleTrunk Never, he headbutts my nuts when I get home, so it's a life long struggle
[0:09:12] <%Maids4lyfe> double explosion
[0:09:13] <ScreamLord> It's ok for PVE
[0:09:14] <%Deathtronhammer> Wish you could get a larger ship

[0:20:56] <%WackyGear> pet the son and he grow stronger
[0:21:00] <%mh9s> he loves it
[0:21:05] <trueherobappo> @AngriestPat Hey pat, any thoughts on the Riot fighting game?
[0:21:07] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> hooray! Good stream!
[0:21:08] <WhereIsWill> elmo love the brush
[0:21:09] <koolaid_kevster> asmr stream?
[0:21:10] <+QueequegTheater> @ScreamLord King's Fall is still the absolute peak of Bungie IMO
[0:21:11] <%merylinspants> Brush the babie apatGib apatGib
[0:21:16] <%dekkitout> I could go for a King's Fall throwback in all honesty...
[0:21:48] <trueherobappo> It kinda reminds me of Street Fighter with what they should during the thing.
[0:21:51] <$Timesteel> they could use the infinite forest as an excuse to bring back the old raids
[0:21:52] <%mh9s> apatGib
[0:21:52] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat how mad do you think Nintendo is over Blizzard canceling the event on them?
[0:21:55] <%miguelrod777> gib hair
[0:21:55] <%shawntk_> pat may eat it tho
[0:21:56] <%Quigsies> Too bad about riot being a bad workplace
[0:21:59] <DavidSanChan> elmo's hair are like french fries to him
[0:22:00] <ScreamLord> @QueequegTheater No arguments here. It was the first Raid I was able to do and my most played raid
[0:22:01] <%LaughingCatt> apatGib
[0:22:06] <%miguelrod777> apatGib
[0:22:06] <+D00msDayDan> @Timesteel vault of glass but you have to cross the infinite forest between every encounter
[0:22:26] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> such a purr on this lad
[0:22:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> I eat a lot of beard hair in my sleep
[0:22:34] <+Pyroclase> I just beat Garden of Salvation for the first time today. Easily my new favorite raid.
[0:22:49] <Ion_Laser> CoolCat
[0:22:55] <+Andrizzleton> IB takes forever to get into
[0:22:58] <$Timesteel> I just want to see more fallen models so tired of just the house of dusk
[0:23:07] <+QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat It's kind of ironic that I consider Eris Morn, the edgiest edge to ever edge, to also represent the heart and soul of Destiny, since she was the most prominent character in Taken King (i.e. the only time Destiny's story was actually good) and she finally shows up in 2 when the story finally gets good
[0:23:08] <valriot> Play some Competitive Kappa Kappa
[0:23:11] <WhereIsWill> literally every animal with hair loves when somoen else brushes them. it's just the facts
[0:23:12] <%alcors_wisdom> pat coming at destiny hot tonight
[0:23:14] <%Ninestempest> YEAH
[0:23:15] <%Ninestempest> SUROS IS THE SHIT
[0:23:15] <trueherobappo> That name makes me slightly moist..
[0:23:23] <+QueequegTheater> Eris being around makes me feel nostalgic
[0:23:29] <%MalekDracarus> I haven’t done a raid since leviathan :(
[0:23:38] <+PapermanXD> @AngriestPat do you use the regime with the dual fire or spin-up?
[0:23:44] <%dekkitout> @QueequegTheater No, Eris is just the consequence of a well written character
[0:23:50] <+QueequegTheater> @trueherobappo He said it on the podcast, but the guns in Destiny are named like swords
[0:23:55] <+PapermanXD> cool
[0:23:58] <+QueequegTheater> @dekkitout yup yup yup
[0:24:06] <+rathekingofthesun> Hmmmm debating buying the expansions now 🤔
[0:24:10] <trueherobappo> @QueequegTheater omg that makes me even more moist..
[0:24:28] <Tucker0603> I'd like that
[0:24:29] <Punisher7771> iorn bannor?
[0:24:30] <%Quigsies> Will we ever get ff7 again?
[0:24:39] <Ion_Laser> @Quigsies tomorrow
[0:24:39] <$Timesteel> could do tuesday reset streams
[0:24:39] <%Ranryu692> until you're bored of it in a few weeks
[0:24:45] <%LymanAl> Geometry
[0:24:47] <+QueequegTheater> @trueherobappo the exotic swords in D1 were called Darkdrinker, Boltcaster, and RAZELIGHTER
[0:24:47] <%Quigsies> Ah, my b

[0:24:57] <+QueequegTheater> cumbo now
[0:24:57] <%dekkitout> This map? This map here? This f-ing map? Fo real?
[0:24:59] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat But what if you cancel FF7?
[0:25:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> He was JUST saying he might stream this and FF7
[0:25:03] <Punisher7771> pat dont show your balls
[0:25:06] <valriot> I thought they removed this map??
[0:25:08] <trueherobappo> @QueequegTheater Pls stop before I flood my room..
[0:25:10] <paprikaei> is this game worth buying for the competitive?
[0:25:11] <%MrBorisMakarov> MrBorisMakarov gifted a Tier 1 sub to QueequegTheater! They have given 152 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:25:15] <%Quigsies> To be fair, you said on twitter that you only make the schedule to mock us
[0:25:22] <$Timesteel> ya I thought they took this map out of rotation
[0:25:38] <+bobfriskit> whats auto is Pat using?
[0:25:48] <ScreamLord> Hate to see it, hate more to experiance it
[0:25:49] <%Piemen99> This map is horrible for control
[0:25:49] <valriot> Telepooooort
[0:25:51] <@StridentSong> Hmm
[0:25:54] <+rathekingofthesun> @Papri destini is free Rn because of the new light expansion
[0:25:58] <%QueequegTheater> Woo. @AngriestPat how far did you get into Destiny 1's story? Because most of it was trash, but the last two expansions (Taken King and Rise of Iron) were pretty alright
[0:25:59] <Ion_Laser> @bobfriskit Suros Regime
[0:26:04] <%legendfather_of_giants> man fuck this map

[0:26:27] <%LiquidShake83> dont run out there silly
[0:26:34] <+Pyroclase> He's just playing PVP.
[0:26:37] <%QueequegTheater> @WackyGear PvP where your item level makes a big difference
[0:26:45] <%QueequegTheater> Also multi-hill KOTH
[0:26:50] <%legendfather_of_giants> @WackyGear PVP, having zones captured increases points earned per kill
[0:26:55] <%WackyGear> ahhh
[0:26:57] <Punisher7771> aboot
[0:26:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Fucking a boot.
[0:26:58] <ScreamLord> If they can do one mission they could probably plug all of D1 into D2
[0:27:00] <%LiquidShake83> then slide
[0:27:09] <uncledoodsauce> pat ja rule has all the weapons
[0:27:13] <%WackyGear> @QueequegTheater @legendfather_of_giants thanks

[0:37:52] <%3Xgilly> You were killed by Vex Tiddies how does that make you feel
[0:37:53] <+Pyroclase> Adhorative is amazing but I can't stand the leaves
[0:37:54] <%dekkitout> I don't play Crucible/Gambit and I'm sitting at 947 from mainly artifact @QueequegTheater
[0:38:01] <+Pyroclase> just pick the leaves off the gun man for the love of god
[0:38:22] <%gunplagoat> the leaves are pretty neat imo
[0:38:23] <%Sc4rekrowe> The leaves are an emergency snack.
[0:38:24] <NiktenKing> The leaves grow from the gun itself
[0:38:27] <NiktenKing> it's in the lore
[0:38:30] <+Pyroclase> it does look nice in taht shader
[0:38:34] <LorcaNomad> Yo pat, where'd you get your ship?
[0:38:43] <zv1neda> aged like fuck?
[0:38:45] <NiktenKing> If you dig into Vex constructs, they grow from the metal
[0:38:45] <+plasticss> is their matchmaking for the hard raids and what not? i hated getting groups together for destiny stuff :/
[0:38:52] <Tucker0603> the leaves are the fucking best
[0:38:55] <%QueequegTheater> @dekkitout cool, right now I'm trying to grind out that 920 nightfall for rewards but it's kind of a wall
[0:38:57] <startstoprepeat> osiris gear dragged through a bush
[0:39:00] <$Timesteel> adhoratative is just the strangers rifle with a normie sight
[0:39:05] <+Pyroclase> Raid matchmaking would never work honestly
[0:39:14] <+Pyroclase> You need tight organization to do raids.
[0:39:16] <%LiquidShake83> matchmake up to hero
[0:39:23] <+plasticss> ah ok
[0:39:29] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat That is clearly just The Stranger's Rifle
[0:39:48] <%QueequegTheater> The best pulse rifle in all of D1
[0:39:49] <Ion_Laser> yeah
[0:39:50] <Jathspuh> is he playing on console or pc with a pad?
[0:39:50] <ScreamLord> yup
[0:39:51] <Kain5707> does gear matter in pvp?
[0:39:54] <+Pyroclase> It's the same model the curse of osiris weapon was modelled on
[0:39:59] <+plasticss> yea the one you get at the end of the story
[0:40:02] <%LiquidShake83> only iron banner
[0:40:04] <$Timesteel> inaugural Address is still my favorite adaptive pulse
[0:40:05] <+plasticss> for d1
[0:40:08] <%QueequegTheater> @Kain5707 Mostly no, but Iron Banner yes
[0:40:09] <Ion_Laser> @Jathspuh pc with a pad
[0:40:09] <%dekkitout> Yeah, it became an exotic that has Polaris Lance's infinite ammo if all crits perk
[0:40:11] <+Pyroclase> oh man that's dude's username is great
[0:40:13] <%LiquidShake83> guns matter in pvp overall
[0:40:18] <%Sc4rekrowe> It was a rare pulse rifle that was so good, they turned it into an exotic. @AngriestPat
[0:40:20] <Tucker0603> yes
[0:40:21] <shurtal> that man's name is FIST FIST FIST FIST FIST FIST
[0:40:21] <Jathspuh> @Ion_Laser WutFace
[0:40:26] <+Andrizzleton> get that mercy win
[0:40:34] <Ion_Laser> @Jathspuh :D
[0:40:35] <Kain5707> interesting
[0:40:43] <Ultimatefool> How the f do you get season levels fast in this
[0:40:45] <%dekkitout> Because based Recluse?
[0:40:46] <%QueequegTheater> AVENGED
[0:41:03] <Kain5707> as a new player should i focus on doing pvp?
[0:41:06] <%QueequegTheater> Wait I didn't see, what perks is it
[0:41:15] <startstoprepeat> feeding frenzy pairs nice with kill clip
[0:41:16] <%LiquidShake83> no fiish story
[0:41:20] <%LiquidShake83> finish
[0:41:22] <+Pyroclase> If you enjoy the PVP then go for it
[0:41:22] <%QueequegTheater> JESUS
[0:41:23] <Thelovelybison> Chaperone is based
[0:41:24] <%QueequegTheater> WTF
[0:41:32] <Tucker0603> NO, KEEP IT
[0:41:34] <%dekkitout> Based Chappy is VERY based!
[0:41:34] <NiktenKing> That guy with all melee icons...
[0:41:36] <NiktenKing> ugh
[0:41:40] <%QueequegTheater> Is that the godroll aside from the MW?
[0:41:42] <+rathekingofthesun> You recommend the expansions pat?
[0:41:51] <%afronooch> i do
[0:42:00] <NiktenKing> I do
[0:42:06] <NiktenKing> Get Forsaken at least
[0:42:06] <+Pyroclase> I have a few issue with Shadowkeep but overall it's great
[0:42:07] <Roz_Lynd> you need to snowball
[0:42:09] <Kain5707> good answer pat :)
[0:42:10] <%LiquidShake83> Ad is apatBig
[0:42:12] <Thelovelybison> Reload speed is actually pretty good since FF doesn’t cap it so the MW pushes that last step
[0:42:14] <+Pyroclase> Eververse being my main gripe
[0:42:17] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat there's a mod to increase rampage duration now
[0:42:18] <+Pyroclase> they put all the good shit there
[0:42:23] <%LiquidShake83> nice melee
[0:42:28] <%QueequegTheater> Man I hate Saladin, Shaxx is so much cooler
[0:42:34] <Roz_Lynd> disagreed
[0:42:34] <Kain5707> i do need to complete the rest of the stories i finished the first one
[0:42:36] <$realm_forge> Get rampage spec from ada
[0:42:38] <%LiquidShake83> does it have onw two?
[0:42:41] <Punisher7771> pats hows your artafact speced out?
[0:42:45] <%afronooch> i just want more ana bae
[0:42:47] <$Timesteel> again LUL
[0:42:52] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Black Armory mod
[0:42:52] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Is it just me or does the Drifter feel like a Chaos recruiter from 40K?
[0:42:53] <Thelovelybison> Mercy’s baby
[0:43:07] <%dekkitout> I saw a meme on r/Destny2 depicting Saladin as a Boomer and it made my day
[0:43:12] <MasterDecoder> Only by one second, and it's from Ada/Black Armory @AngriestPat
[0:43:13] <$realm_forge> You get it from ada
[0:43:14] <Tucker0603> big chugg
[0:43:24] <Kain5707> unlimited POWER!
[0:43:28] <Thelovelybison> He already has rampage spec guys
[0:43:39] <%3Xgilly> you can hold RT to compare that piece with what you have on
[0:43:41] <$Timesteel> I think stat mods add like 10 points
[0:43:52] <%dekkitout> Get off my lawn!
[0:43:55] <%QueequegTheater> Fuck Saladin for being such a killjoy but at least he's not literally getting guardians killed like Drifter
[0:43:56] <+Pyroclase> I so wish there was a way to automelt blues
[0:44:09] <Kain5707> R2 to compare pat
[0:44:09] <Thelovelybison> I’ve noticed that I can’t keep on top of all the blues that drop now
[0:44:11] <Punisher7771> infusion bate pat
[0:44:14] <%Deathtronhammer> You look like a floating Atilla the Hun
[0:44:15] <+Mittensbro> The UI for this game looks kind of awful
[0:44:17] <%LiquidShake83> keep mobile
[0:44:19] <+Pyroclase> mobility is better than resliience imo
[0:44:22] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat R2 is compare
[0:44:25] <+rathekingofthesun> Legit been reading destinypedia to sleep 😴
[0:44:26] <%TheSniperJoe> That's 65 though, the stat cap is way higher.
[0:44:30] <+Andrizzleton> but 65....number go down
[0:44:32] <Thelovelybison> Don’t worry about drifter he’s a double double agent in with shin
[0:44:40] <%QueequegTheater> @Deathtronhammer Are you not familiar with Destiny's style?
[0:44:43] <%3Xgilly> LUL
[0:44:48] <trueherobappo> @AngriestPat Yea, good brother Pat. Catch you tomorrow night.
[0:44:52] <Kain5707> vineBlind
[0:44:53] <%Deathtronhammer> Cannot say I am @QueequegTheater
[0:44:54] <Kain5707> R2
[0:44:57] <%LiquidShake83> ok do it
[0:45:02] <Thelovelybison> Not worth the recov hit
[0:45:07] <+Thomzzz> Hey Pat i just wanna thank you and a friend for being the driving force for me to play this game i love it now!
[0:45:17] <Kain5707> LUL
[0:45:18] <closetgremlin12> night.
[0:45:37] <%TaifuDragon> It depends on the build
[0:45:40] <%dekkitout> That's basically what T12 stats were in D1
[0:45:42] <%QueequegTheater> @Deathtronhammer Everyone looks like fantasy characters it's the best
[0:45:45] <%cappyd33> min max everything
[0:45:50] <$Timesteel> int is good it's basically just a super mod
[0:45:53] <Thelovelybison> Strength is less useful because any melee builds will just have Monte Carlo now
[0:45:58] <SomersaultJustice> nuf
[0:46:01] <+Thomzzz> fuck it destiny rules
[0:46:04] <%TaifuDragon> I'm using sunbracers so I max out my strength and fuck discipline off, because who needs discipline when I can throw five fucking grenades at once
[0:46:06] <%cvp5127> NUF
[0:46:07] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Pat's happy? That's a good thing.
[0:46:08] <DestroPrime83> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, just soloed Arch Tempered Vaal Hazak
[0:46:11] <+ForteBlade> channel ded, but at least you had fun
[0:46:12] <%Deathtronhammer> @QueequegTheater Fantasy characters with ridiculous guns from the looks of it XD
[0:46:14] <+Grayhammatter> i'm fine wtih it
[0:46:16] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Eh, it's okay I guess
[0:46:20] <Kain5707> Kain5707 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! limesO
[0:46:22] <+Grayhammatter> get fucked, fucko
[0:46:24] <Punisher7771> are you playing with other pat?
[0:46:26] <%Ranryu692> I hate Destiny 2, but I'm here
[0:46:27] <%dekkitout> @TaifuDragon <--- This guy knows
[0:46:32] <+Pyroclase> ew wormhaven
[0:46:37] <%QueequegTheater> @Deathtronhammer The guns are named like swords and the swords are named Boltcaster, Razelighter, and Darkdrinker
[0:46:45] <%LiquidShake83> it reloads so quick
[0:46:50] <Aydarkzero> what masterwork did you get on the pulse?
[0:46:56] <%QueequegTheater> @Aydarkzero reload
[0:47:08] <Aydarkzero> thats dirty!
[0:47:08] <%3Xgilly> Oh no...toxic Pat is evolving
[0:47:09] <%Deathtronhammer> @QueequegTheater Ok that's hilarious and almost sounds like an over-the-top fiction
[0:47:19] <Thelovelybison> I feel like ikora building a vex gate in the middle of the city isn’t the greatest idea
[0:47:25] <%dekkitout> It is ott fiction
[0:47:34] <+Grayhammatter> your team is not doing the best
[0:47:45] <Kain5707> make it count
[0:47:45] <+DrFacilier> excuses
[0:47:51] <%dekkitout> There's this Dionysus-Bot lookin guy who LOVES being evil and hedonistic and opulent
[0:47:56] <Kain5707> oh shit i have a founder badge
[0:47:58] <Thelovelybison> Played advantages in control is the worst
[0:48:01] <Reaverund> I miss the big maps from D1
[0:48:08] <%QueequegTheater> @Deathtronhammer Destiny 1's story was awful except for the Taken King expansion, but the lore has always been cool as shit. Did you know there used to be Dragon Ball-esque wish granting dragons?
[0:48:10] <+D00msDayDan> get brrrt'd
[0:48:11] <Kain5707> thats embarrassing vineJape
[0:48:18] <%QueequegTheater> Until the guardians hunted them all down
[0:48:20] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat love seeing you stream this man, and glad you're finally enjoying it
[0:48:27] <Thelovelybison> And you kill one of them in a raid
[0:48:27] <+rathekingofthesun> Awww riven is coooool!
[0:48:29] <+Pyroclase> Not only are there wishgranting dragons, you get to fucking murder one
[0:48:35] <%TaifuDragon> Oh
[0:48:38] <%dekkitout> Based Sweet Business is also based
[0:48:39] <%3Xgilly> Bro that bullet spray
[0:48:40] <Jathspuh> that clip size LUL
[0:48:43] <%TaifuDragon> Not to mention the wishgranting dragons literally feed on possibility
[0:48:44] <+bobfriskit> @QueequegTheater yeah fuck those dragons
[0:48:46] <Punisher7771> mmmmm
[0:48:47] <%TaifuDragon> It's called "Anthem Anathema"
[0:48:47] <%dekkitout> 150 in the mag btw
[0:48:50] <Thelovelybison> That guy is vibing with Sweet business
[0:48:55] <Jathspuh> jeez
[0:48:56] <%QueequegTheater> @bobfriskit indeed
[0:49:00] <+Grayhammatter> you did indeed miss
[0:49:02] <%FuzzTime> FuzzTime subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:49:05] <%TaifuDragon> "Anthem Anathema" meaning they feed on the difference between what is and what might be
[0:49:07] <+rathekingofthesun> Also the fallen are legit dope
[0:49:09] <%TaifuDragon> The worm gods are the same
[0:49:17] <%LiquidShake83> nice
[0:49:25] <Kain5707> hes not doing bad for controller on PC
[0:49:25] <+rathekingofthesun> & sword logic 🗡
[0:49:30] <Thelovelybison> The fallen are the best imo, mostly cause they actually have individual motives
[0:49:33] <%QueequegTheater> SWORD LOGIC IS SO COOL
[0:49:43] <%QueequegTheater> IT'S THE FUCKING RADDEST SHIT EVER
[0:49:50] <%dekkitout> Also the Awoken are basically Amazonian Space elves
[0:49:51] <+rathekingofthesun> YEYEYEYE
[0:50:05] <Ion_Laser> PogChamp
[0:50:08] <+Grayhammatter> jesuss
[0:50:19] <%TaifuDragon> Sword Logic is brilliant
[0:50:19] <Ion_Laser> Monster Kill!!!
[0:50:19] <%LiquidShake83> you apatBig now
[0:50:21] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Do you know about sword logic
[0:50:24] <Thelovelybison> That reload thoug
[0:50:26] <Tucker0603> Petra best girl
[0:50:27] <+rathekingofthesun> Ye but the awoken purposefully fuck over one another on the daily. Especially earth space elves
[0:50:30] <%QueequegTheater> Because sword logic is fucking dope
[0:50:33] <%TaifuDragon> by the way, read Tyrannocide
[0:50:34] <NiktenKing> Hammerhead AKA the best scout rifle in the game
[0:50:35] <Kain5707> carrying the team
[0:50:36] <+Pyroclase> Sword Logic is the best shit
[0:50:39] <%TaifuDragon> It explains literally everything
[0:50:43] <Aydarkzero> Sword Logic is THE BEST
[0:50:43] <+Grayhammatter> pat's doing work
[0:50:49] <%LiquidShake83> pat carried again
[0:50:56] <%QueequegTheater> @NiktenKing only because they're too cowardly to bring Tlaloc forward for Warlocks KappaHD
[0:51:01] <+Arcaenum> The back to back power play
[0:51:02] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:51:08] <Punisher7771> ha
[0:51:10] <%dekkitout> Sword Logic is the most literal edge lord nonsense and it's great
[0:51:10] <Thelovelybison> Tfw no Fabian or tlaloc
[0:51:13] <dawnks> Sword logic SUCKSSSS
[0:51:20] <%QueequegTheater> @dawnks YOU suck
[0:51:23] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[0:51:26] <%QueequegTheater> gottem
[0:51:27] <Kain5707> you are the team LUL
[0:51:32] <dawnks> LUL
[0:51:32] <NiktenKing> @QueequegTheater Until we lose Ikora...
[0:51:36] <+Pyroclase> Pat's better at PVP than me. So... good for him!
[0:51:39] <%LiquidShake83> AD was such a better choice
[0:51:42] <%depressed_skeleton> Pats back must hurt
[0:51:42] <+Grayhammatter> i mean, you basically are the team
[0:51:45] <DestroPrime83> Anyone else getting weird video playback glitch?
[0:51:49] <+Pyroclase> yup
[0:51:52] <%depressed_skeleton> all this carrying
[0:51:52] <%QueequegTheater> @NiktenKing I mean, she clearly prefers shotguns
[0:51:53] <+Pyroclase> it's dropping frames still
[0:51:55] <+rathekingofthesun> Plus the hive gods kissing up to the word gods until oryx starts killing em
[0:52:01] <Punisher7771> we still dont have a hunter vangard
[0:52:02] <+rathekingofthesun> *worm
[0:52:05] <%LiquidShake83> lol
[0:52:06] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[0:52:10] <Jathspuh> wack
[0:52:10] <%TaifuDragon> @rathekingofthesun not exactly
[0:52:13] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> what an answer
[0:52:13] <%QueequegTheater> Oh man that noise gave me fucking flashbacks
[0:52:13] <%TaifuDragon> The worm gods are the Hive's gods
[0:52:15] <%depressed_skeleton> wack
[0:52:20] <%TaifuDragon> The hive have worms inside them
[0:52:22] <%TaifuDragon> That's how the hive work
[0:52:23] <%dekkitout> DELYEETED
[0:52:25] <Thelovelybison> Sword logic is basically ork logic combined with “I kill you, I’m better” which is super fun when oryx and his sisters setting up basically EXP mines to constantly feed their worms and get swole
[0:52:28] <%LiquidShake83> brick
[0:52:30] <%TaifuDragon> But Oryx killing a worm god is sword logic
[0:52:46] <%TaifuDragon> It proves he's stronger and thus worthy of the powers the worm had
[0:52:46] <+rathekingofthesun> The hive are basically the Titans from attack on titan 👀
[0:53:06] <%LiquidShake83> lol
[0:53:09] <+Grayhammatter> oh!
[0:53:14] <+Grayhammatter> i think he died
[0:53:20] <%Sc4rekrowe> He went Back to the Future!
[0:53:25] <%QueequegTheater> Sword logic would be basic and boring but they clearly thought it through because literally the entire Hive society shows the natural logical progression of millions of years of it
[0:53:30] <%LiquidShake83> top of the board?
[0:53:32] <%QueequegTheater> So it's fucking awesome
[0:53:38] <%dekkitout> Now now, I wouldn't go as far as to say Oryx did nothing wrong... @rathekingofthesun
[0:53:41] <Kain5707> crushed
[0:53:46] <+Pyroclase> kill clip?
[0:53:46] <+rathekingofthesun> And one of oryx sons starts getting up in necromancy and shit and all the other hive and taken are like fuck that shits weird get out
[0:53:47] <%LiquidShake83> moving target
[0:53:54] <%QueequegTheater> ORYX DID MANY THINGS WRONG
[0:53:55] <Punisher7771> atleast im not seeing moutantop recluse
[0:54:02] <%FuzzTime> That shotgun reload animation is orgasmic
[0:54:02] <%QueequegTheater> Like all the genocide
[0:54:20] <Punisher7771> @AngriestPat did your food get stolen again?
[0:54:21] <+Arcaenum> It can roll feeding frenzy/multikill clip
[0:54:26] <%Frost_Quill> Frost_Quill subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! Hey you ginger dwarf love your videos. What's up with your Vampire the Masquerade videos? I can still watch them on twitch but those will probably be gone eventually, what's up with the youtube version?
[0:54:27] <Thelovelybison> Now oryx is chilling in a gun which we’re probably gonna get again soon judging by the collectors edition lore stuff
[0:54:30] <Aydarkzero> Oryx fucked up big time when he made that deal
[0:54:35] <+rathekingofthesun> @dekkitout oryx an innocent lad just trying to feed his unholy religion godhood
[0:54:37] <%QueequegTheater> Yes
[0:54:39] <+junks2300> Hey Pat, I got back into Destiny 2 and suddenly my character is max level and light 450 and all my gear is useless. What happen?
[0:54:40] <%LiquidShake83> yes
[0:54:41] <+Pyroclase> it's a matter of preference
[0:54:42] <+Arcaenum> It is in crucible
[0:54:44] <Tucker0603> KEEP IT
[0:54:45] <+FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat Yes, but you have to reload for it
[0:54:48] <+Pyroclase> but MCK has a higher possible damage
[0:54:48] <%LiquidShake83> with large reserve
[0:54:58] <Thelovelybison> Multi kill clip is good in pve it’s unlikely in pvp
[0:54:59] <Kain5707> 3.25 jesus fuck
[0:54:59] <%TheSniperJoe> For pvp kill clip/mtuli kill clip> rampage
[0:55:01] <%LiquidShake83> depends on the weapon
[0:55:03] <%QueequegTheater> @junks2300 new expansion, go to the moon and pick up some 750 blues
[0:55:07] <%dekkitout> @rathekingofthesun At the end of the day (s)he fell for a pyramid scheme like many of us do...
[0:55:11] <Tucker0603> yes
[0:55:12] <+Pyroclase> *** go
[0:55:13] <+Arcaenum> It technicallly is in PvE, it does more damage at max stacks than rampage would at max
[0:55:16] <%TaifuDragon> Here's the thing
[0:55:21] <%TaifuDragon> the Hive don't follow actual sword logic
[0:55:24] <Thelovelybison> For pvp swashbuck/kill clip>mkc/rampage
[0:55:24] <%TaifuDragon> The tribute system violates it
[0:55:34] <%TaifuDragon> It's basically the only thing limiting them
[0:55:38] <+Arcaenum> Dragonfly isn't bad either
[0:55:49] <%QueequegTheater> @rathekingofthesun Oryx literally turned down the traveler for some deep sea Sith bullshit
[0:55:49] <%LiquidShake83> you would
[0:55:53] <Thelovelybison> Dragonfly is bad on pulses for a reason
[0:55:55] <+Arcaenum> Put a dragonfly spec in that bad boy
[0:55:58] <+rathekingofthesun> @dekkitout plez nice pyramid. Give us salvation from these circles of blesshood
[0:56:07] <%dekkitout> @QueequegTheater He did it to save Padme BibleThump
[0:56:19] <%QueequegTheater> @dekkitout But Padme was himself in this metaphor
[0:56:24] <Thelovelybison> Since dragonfly scales off the damage of the individual bullet that killed the enemies, which is why auto rifle dragonfly is so weak compared to a hand cannon or snipers
[0:56:25] <+rathekingofthesun> 😆😆😆
[0:56:26] <startstoprepeat> feeding frenzy/multi killclip with some nice range perks is the dream roll
[0:56:37] <Aydarkzero> i think my ideal roll would be high caliber/ricochet rounds, feeding and multi kill or rampage tbh
[0:56:38] <%TaifuDragon> nah Padme is savathun
[0:56:40] <+Arcaenum> Oh yeah i forgot about the dragonfly scaling thing
[0:56:41] <Punisher7771> @AngriestPat the rason i asked is cause that happened to me yesterday and he had the balls to show up anyway. well he cant eat with that shattered jaw i gave him.
[0:56:46] <+FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat I think dragonfly scales with bullet damage, so high ROF guns arent good with ut
[0:56:47] <%3Xgilly> Hey pat just to let you know, im super enjoying your destiny streams! Gotta go to bed tho
[0:56:52] <%3Xgilly> Work tomorrow
[0:56:58] <+rathekingofthesun> I need these pyramids to role in and start prodding the traveler slightly
[0:57:12] <+Mottyrob> Has anyone here ever seen anyone play Dominos IRL?
[0:57:18] <+rathekingofthesun> Night! @3xgilly
[0:57:37] <+Pyroclase> claws of the wolf is great with full auto
[0:57:41] <%dekkitout> @Mottyrob Have you not been to cookouts?
[0:57:49] <Thelovelybison> Claw is good now with rapid fire buffs
[0:57:51] <+Mottyrob> Nope
[0:57:52] <%LiquidShake83> fire speed?
[0:57:55] <+DrFacilier> POG
[0:57:56] <Aydarkzero> WHAT A PRO

[0:58:06] <%MegboyManuel> LOL
[0:58:07] <+Arcaenum> Such amazing skill Pat
[0:58:07] <Thelovelybison> Kill clip is generally preferable on high rate of fire weapons to rampage though
[0:58:07] <+rathekingofthesun> Lol 😂
[0:58:08] <+DrFacilier> that was a close match
[0:58:08] <%dekkitout> 3 good 5 u
[0:58:10] <+Pyroclase> FLAWLESS VICTORY
[0:58:11] <%mintyrobo> apatHat
[0:58:14] <+rathekingofthesun> Perfect victory
[0:58:19] <zv1neda> what that npc said
[0:58:19] <Tucker0603> that's great
[0:58:24] <+rathekingofthesun> God smiles on pat today
[0:58:25] <%mh9s> i can't believe these prostrats
[0:58:28] <zv1neda> perfect timing
[0:58:37] <MidnightBurst12> mvp
[0:58:37] <Punisher7771> they quit sas soon as pat came on the feild
[0:58:47] <Thelovelybison> Just join a winning game to win 4Head
[0:58:47] <+Mottyrob> I'm thinking Dominos and Mahjong are in the same tier boardgame, where you'd rather line up the pieces and watch them fall than actually play the game the pieces are for
[0:59:06] <%dekkitout> You've clearly never played dominos for cash...
[0:59:32] <+Arcaenum> Do you have Inaugural Adress from the Leviathan raid? It's an adaptive pulse with outlaw/kill clip.
[0:59:36] <+Mottyrob> Poker I can do, Dominos? nah
[0:59:41] <Zereaux> im a itan
[0:59:42] <+rathekingofthesun> Real pros play dice for cash 💵 💵 💵
[0:59:50] <+rathekingofthesun> 😂
[0:59:58] <%dekkitout> Also, yes
[1:00:06] <+DrFacilier> wtf
[1:00:16] <+Pyroclase> rapid fire?
[1:00:22] <+Pyroclase> you mean full auto trigger system?
[1:00:28] <+Grayhammatter> absolutely disgusting, i can't believe you've done this
[1:00:37] <%dekkitout> I don't think this is the pulse that rolls rapid hit
[1:00:41] <+junks2300> It feels super weird. I made a brand new character, and it sorta just.. jumped me to the end of the leveling progression. I know its a new expansion, but do I just not get to see the old stuff that I missed? Or is it still relevant
[1:00:42] <+Arcaenum> That's a really good claws of the wolf though, lots of range for a rapid fire frame
[1:01:20] <+Grayhammatter> do you?
[1:01:22] <Roz_Lynd> toldja @AngriestPat
[1:01:23] <zv1neda> and thats why
[1:01:23] <+Arcaenum> @junks2300 You can go to Amanda at the tower play the old campaigns if you want to.
[1:01:24] <+bobfriskit> what website is Pat checking anyone know?
[1:01:26] <+rathekingofthesun> @junks2300 the old campaign stuff is over in the hanger at the vendor
[1:01:28] <Roz_Lynd> that's why i like it
[1:01:35] <+Arcaenum> But there isn't a big reason to do them unless you really want to
[1:01:35] <+rathekingofthesun> Still pretty decent
[1:01:43] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> if you can get one with a kill clip roll you're in the money
[1:01:44] <NiktenKing> Stagger the shit out of them
[1:01:49] <+KSabot> lol shotty
[1:01:52] <zv1neda> POG
[1:02:12] <%depressed_skeleton> Don't get cocky kid!
[1:02:13] <%MegboyManuel> JESUS that shotgun hits like a truck
[1:02:16] <%dekkitout> My Chaperone and I can't here you from across the football field range it has...
[1:02:20] <%MegboyManuel> is that the slug gun?
[1:02:24] <+Grayhammatter> well that's a PogChamp shotgun
[1:02:27] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> yes it is
[1:02:33] <wasalujaco> lmao chaperone is a beaut
[1:02:37] <DestroPrime83> Meh ive seen better shotgun in Halo
[1:02:50] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@MasterDecoder) (warning)
[1:02:51] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> it's one of the few slug shotguns in the game
[1:02:56] <%MegboyManuel> just one fat slug to the face
[1:02:57] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[1:02:58] <+Grayhammatter> he did it
[1:03:05] <Kain5707> Pat how are you enjoying this compared to warframes?
[1:03:11] <Cymen90> Now go! Let the legend of Snapshot return to life! @angriestpat
[1:03:30] <MasterDecoder> Piss off MooBot, it wasn't even a completed link
[1:03:44] <Punisher7771> high mobility is great for shotgunriushing
[1:03:48] <%VirtuaRailith> So Pat played Destiny 2, then played Warframe, then bought a bunch of space hats in Warframe, then went back to Destiny 2
[1:03:49] <%MalekDracarus> How good is killclip and rampage on the claws?
[1:03:57] <%MegboyManuel> i prefer legend of acrius myself, but Chaperone is SEXY
[1:04:18] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> @malekdracarus kill clip on any rapid fire frame is insane now with the buff they received
[1:05:03] <+Grayhammatter> time to zap some fools
[1:05:03] <WhereIsWill> so uh how do I get ma hands on that shotty?
[1:05:11] <%MegboyManuel> kamehameha Warlock?
[1:05:11] <$paprikaei> Cheer100 in your opinion is this game worth getting for the competetive alone

[1:05:37] <+junks2300> Is Pat playing on PC with a controller, or is this PS4?
[1:05:44] <NiktenKing> Considering that it is free... for the most part, yes.
[1:05:47] <%MalekDracarus> @the_lady_alustriel Awesome thanks
[1:05:48] <%QueequegTheater> RPGShihu

[1:08:46] <Roz_Lynd> that guy took a beating

[1:08:57] <Frostydough1> Any tips on getting over how the movement feels? Im coming from Warframe and REALLY wanna give Destiny 2 an honest try @AngriestPat
[1:09:01] <Roz_Lynd> it's a slug shotgun
[1:09:02] <CalusRaccoon> aaaah gotcha thank you
[1:09:17] <%QueequegTheater> @Frostydough1 What part of it is bugging you?
[1:09:33] <Frostydough1> @QueequegTheater not sure i feel, clunky i guess?
[1:09:46] <%dekkitout> Destiny's movement is along the lines of Halo/CoD, the most unique movements get are the Warlock's blink
[1:09:58] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> unless you're Titanfall
[1:10:11] <+TheBitingIrish> I've run out of glimmer :(
[1:10:13] <$Arcaenum> Cheer200 Gotta throw a couple bits in to show some love for the Destiny streams.

[1:10:28] <%InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat I too wanna play destiny 2 but I have no clue WTF to do??
[1:10:31] <Aydarkzero> @TheBitingIrish check with Spider PogChamp
[1:10:36] <%QueequegTheater> @rathekingofthesun number go up
[1:10:36] <NiktenKing> Hunter rolls and sidesteps, blinks, and triple jumps are probably the best feeling movement options
[1:10:40] <CalusRaccoon> brettuLove Elmo~
[1:10:43] <Frostydough1> oof i guess illl probably get used to it then, thanks though!
[1:11:05] <%QueequegTheater> @InugamiTheHound do the story to level up quick then do strikes/Nightfalls
[1:11:19] <%LiquidShake83> do it
[1:11:21] <%QueequegTheater> Once you're past 900, try some PVP
[1:11:24] <+TheBitingIrish> @queequegtheater and they're constantly trying to one-up themselves
[1:11:44] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> Don't sleep on Mobility, it gives you strafe speed that can definitely let you out-shoot your opponents @angriestpat
[1:12:08] <%LiquidShake83> do it
[1:12:16] <NiktenKing> Mobility is great for PvE cause it determines jump height
[1:12:19] <+rathekingofthesun> Whose your favorite enemy type pat?

[1:13:29] <+Pyroclase> @depressed_skeleton everyone's quest was bugged. It's actually progressed by SMG kills
[1:13:29] <Roz_Lynd> haha i'm glad you like it now buddy @AngriestPat quiettKek
[1:13:38] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> shaxx has my goddamn sword and he refuses to give it back
[1:13:43] <dabeaminator> How impenetrable is this game for someone completely new? Thanks to your constant discussion about this game I'm gonna give it a try on steam.
[1:13:44] <Tucker0603> incorrect
[1:13:49] <%depressed_skeleton> @Pyroclase Yeah but mine kept doing 15 kills...over and over and over again
[1:13:50] <NiktenKing> Field prep is amazing for sniper rifles what are you talking about
[1:13:52] <+Grayhammatter> nope
[1:14:07] <%logoth_> Yay its just like Monster Hunter World Deco hunting
[1:14:17] <MasterDecoder> "Already had that" apparently not
[1:14:31] <%QueequegTheater> @dabeaminator Pretty easy, do the story to level up, then do some strikes. It's not so much deep and impenetrable as it is wide, with tons of different paths to take
[1:14:49] <MasterDecoder> Arc Class Item are the worst
[1:15:06] <MasterDecoder> *Items
[1:15:12] <%QueequegTheater> You leave Banshee alone
[1:15:15] <+Pyroclase> hey, black scoprion isn't bad

[1:15:40] <Roz_Lynd> HAHAHA wow
[1:15:44] <%QueequegTheater> FUCK OFF
[1:16:01] <NiktenKing> stability
[1:16:02] <MasterDecoder> Headseeker > Rampage imo
[1:16:16] <%QueequegTheater> I am so salty right now
[1:16:17] <+Pyroclase> headseeker is okay for PVP but it's terrible in PVE.
[1:16:20] <+Pyroclase> The damage is abysmal.
[1:16:22] <NiktenKing> Headseeker is better because it doesn't require the kill condition
[1:16:30] <NiktenKing> but rampage is just better overall
[1:16:33] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> headseeker as a perk assumes you're going to miss your headshots and that's not a good feeling
[1:16:35] <DSD24> Hi Pat hi everyone!
[1:16:37] <$Arcaenum> Ive never really liked headseeker
[1:16:43] <Ion_Laser> @DSD24 sup
[1:16:45] <+Pyroclase> flared magwell
[1:16:49] <+Mottyrob> Pat you gotta use the good one
[1:16:49] <%LiquidShake83> it doesn't rampage thought to accomidate the large mag
[1:16:58] <DSD24> @Ion_Laser Hello! how's your day going?
[1:17:04] <+junks2300> Cool 3c6 match in IB
[1:17:09] <Ion_Laser> @DSD24 It's been going good
[1:17:26] <%LiquidShake83> break stuff down
[1:17:33] <%QueequegTheater> Lucatiel still > Solaire, suck it nerdz
[1:17:35] <+HazMat997> why does that gun look like a Sawn-Off Redrix Broadsword lol
[1:17:46] <NiktenKing> There are some guns where headseeker is better because body vs head round count would be better
[1:17:59] <+Mittensbro> @QueequegTheater Being wrong isn't illegal. No one will persecute you.
[1:18:07] <NiktenKing> or the same so going for easier shots is safer
[1:18:16] <+Pyroclase> It's imporatant to note that headseeker only applies its effect to a single burst.
[1:18:22] <DSD24> Hey Chat should I buy Shadow Keep or Forsaken first?
[1:18:29] <%dekkitout> Forsaken
[1:18:29] <%logoth_> This loot system looks confusing
[1:18:42] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> it's kinda great
[1:18:44] <%QueequegTheater> @Mittensbro but I'm not wrong tho
[1:18:49] <arkv01> sure, backtracking is fine
[1:18:50] <Zebroneath> It's fun, it feel good to shoot
[1:18:51] <$Arcaenum> PvP is pretty great imo
[1:18:52] <%mh9s> of all alleged humans
[1:18:54] <NiktenKing> I mean, when you delete them with Chaperone, yeah
[1:18:54] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> for an fps without dedicated servers its pretty good
[1:18:55] <arkv01> er backpeddling
[1:19:00] <%dekkitout> It's nice when a train of OEM titans aren't railing you...
[1:19:01] <%InugamiTheHound> Halo>>>>>>Destiny
[1:19:01] <%Neo_Kaiser> Did the check clear?
[1:19:05] <%MegboyManuel> never pictured you as the type to play call of duty in space
[1:19:06] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat It's almost like Halo had really great PVP
[1:19:14] <Ion_Laser> ^
[1:19:23] <%Basch71> its just halo with space magic
[1:19:25] <+TrashWizardTrence> @angriestpat I'm about to start playing destiny 2 after your talks about it on the castle of beasts. Any tips or things you wish you knew when you hopped in?
[1:19:34] <%QueequegTheater> @MegboyManuel That's just proof you don't actually know this game's aesthetic
[1:19:35] <+Grayhammatter> FeelsBadMan
[1:19:40] <DFireCreations> @dsd24 forsaken, it's got plenty of content
[1:19:44] <%Saltmeisterr> rip
[1:19:44] <zamzoph> Twitch version is better with chat anyway
[1:19:49] <+Pyroclase> I love Destiny!!
[1:19:53] <+Pyroclase> Except the parts I hate.
[1:19:54] <%MalekDracarus> Eh. Love my pve too much to get into PvP too much
[1:19:54] <%Saltmeisterr> I HATE
[1:19:57] <%Ranryu692> @AngriestPat That's not true, I hate Destiny 2
[1:19:58] <%Neo_Kaiser> I do
[1:19:58] <%mh9s> destiny two is TRASH
[1:20:01] <+Grayhammatter> but now we can't watch the stupid dancing your character does up in the club
[1:20:06] <DSD24> @DFireCreations Don't you get a bow as well when you play the campaign?
[1:20:06] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat How far did you get in D1's story?
[1:20:06] <%dekkitout> I hate-fuck D2, does that count? SeriousSloth
[1:20:06] <NiktenKing> He kinda had Destiny background already, so it's not like he came in not knowing everything
[1:20:11] <%Saltmeisterr> no flossing 0/10
[1:20:16] <raypoint_223> I really dont think I can get into destiny 2 and I really dont want to invest in a f2p game.
[1:20:22] <%rainwater739> Still playing?
[1:20:26] <%InugamiTheHound> I'm in different to destiny only because I watched my brother play it 3 years on and off with his friends.
[1:20:28] <%Kyma1020> Kyma1020 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 8 month streak! You thought it was a stream baby joke, but IT WAS ME! DIO!
[1:20:32] <%QueequegTheater> Oh yeah, then of course you hated it LUL
[1:20:38] <+Andrizzleton> i got to earf
[1:20:39] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat Is it possible to still play through Destiny 1 story content?
[1:20:43] <dabeaminator> I resent it for taking Bungie away from Halo and leaving it in the filthy hands of 343 Industries, but it seems like a decent game in its own right.
[1:20:47] <%QueequegTheater> There was no story until Crota
[1:20:48] <DFireCreations> @dsd24 yup, you get a bow pretty early in the Foraaken campaign
[1:20:50] <+Pyroclase> Pat, did you know that originally the Black Garden was supposed to be the inside of the traveller? It causes the entire story of Destiny 1 to suddenly make sense.
[1:20:54] <%Saltmeisterr> lewd
[1:20:54] <King_thunder365> I didn't like Destiny 2. Especially not when I wasn't gonna buy it, but then my brother stole some of MY money to buy me a copy to get me to play it with him.
[1:20:54] <+Grayhammatter> no, no i don't
[1:20:55] <%rainwater739> Lmao
[1:20:55] <%dekkitout> "I don't have time to explain why the script was changed last minute..."
[1:20:56] <+Mottyrob> I don't hate it but I came in during the steam release, nothing is explained properly and anything that gets explained is explained poorly, very confusing for new players.
[1:20:58] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> D1 didn't have a story until Taken King
[1:21:03] <+Andrizzleton> i'd love if they just added Destiny 1 content to the game
[1:21:10] <+D00msDayDan> there was story in vanilla d1, it was just terribly communicated and people HATE paying attention and reading
[1:21:12] <+Andrizzleton> they kinda had a throwback mission for RiskRunner
[1:21:15] <DSD24> @DFireCreations I'll probably go for that one then
[1:21:29] <%Ninestempest> >half of the cosmodrome
[1:21:32] <%Ninestempest> wtf you talking about
[1:21:32] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat I hope so. Taken King is still the best story Bungie's ever done
[1:21:34] <MasterDecoder> I doubt that
[1:21:35] <+Grayhammatter> yikes
[1:21:35] <%LiquidShake83> you gonna get back into monster hunter anytime soon? I've seen max gettin down on it lately.
[1:21:38] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> you also had to go to. a website to read about the story
[1:21:40] <%dekkitout> Yeetun more like it
[1:21:45] <%InugamiTheHound> I wish destiny had a good story and characters and explain WTF is going on with this game. I hate looking up shit just to find out the story
[1:21:47] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Jotunn takes 5 weeks minimum now
[1:21:49] <MasterDecoder> and only 1/4 PAt
[1:21:57] <$Arcaenum> Man I miss cosmodrome
[1:22:00] <Ion_Laser> Reading grimoire cards on the bungie website was a pain in the ass
[1:22:03] <%legendfather_of_giants> SHAXX INCARNATE
[1:22:05] <$Timesteel> we only have like maybe 1/8th of the cosmodrome if you also count the plaguelands
[1:22:05] <startstoprepeat> brad from giant bomb asked them about it and they said they'd like to but memory and storage concerns are holding them back
[1:22:08] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @QueequegTheater Damn really? I loved Taken so I hope the new expasnion improved and went beyonmd that
[1:22:17] <DSD24> I recently picked Destiny 2 back up again after it when free to play
[1:22:26] <%shattywack> I've had D2 on PC since launch and I've yet to actually play any of it. Why would I do that
[1:22:32] <%QueequegTheater> @6PoundsofShrimp new expansion is really cool but it's like 5 hours of story content
[1:22:44] <%QueequegTheater> Taken King was a whole new game
[1:22:47] <%dekkitout> Shaxx only sings for Mara
[1:22:50] <+Mittensbro> @InugamiTheHound If a game has a story and it is not told within the game, it doesn't have a story. It's the same thing with Overwatch; those comics and stuff aren't in the game, so they don't exist.
[1:22:55] <%dekkitout> True story
[1:22:56] <%QueequegTheater> THE HELMET STAYED ON, DAMMIT
[1:22:59] <%Neo_Kaiser> It's funny, the Destiny story is badly told but it's also very simple. The story is just a simple, "Defeat the Darkness".
[1:23:00] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Shaxx can recite the Tempest from memory tho
[1:23:01] <DFireCreations> I'm cool with reading the lore books for story now that they're in the game
[1:23:03] <+D00msDayDan> @AngriestPat did you know saladin's voice actor is reaper? if you get a huge killsteak he even goes "die, die, die!"
[1:23:03] <MasterDecoder> Shaxx is big into poetry and plays
[1:23:03] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @QueequegTheater True, I'm still palying the free version cause like idk if the 30 dollar expansion is worth it
[1:23:06] <DSD24> The Dahkness
[1:23:11] <+Cadwae> @AngriestPat What shotgun is that?
[1:23:12] <$realm_forge> Jotun is basically a heavy that uses green ammo
[1:23:12] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> Shaxx banged Mara Sov and left the helmet on, he earned it
[1:23:34] <zv1neda> please tell me that is true lore
[1:23:42] <$Timesteel> the roadborn ornament actually improves the chaperone it gives it more range because the barrel length is longer
[1:23:46] <NiktenKing> It is.... sort of
[1:23:47] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Did you know Shaxx had a one night stand with the Awoken Queen and kept his helmet on
[1:23:47] <%MegboyManuel> Even the name's got a nice ring to it. "Chaperone"
[1:23:49] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Pat rn I've only been playing pvp, what mission would you recommend doing for better gear? I'm a titan
[1:23:53] <%logoth_> You'd be doing better if you used the Gamer Cube
[1:23:54] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> it's true lore
[1:23:55] <dabeaminator> I'm going through the Halo series again chronologically starting with the novels, and boy did Pat's comment about Halo's story being bad on CSB grind my gears.
[1:23:58] <+rathekingofthesun> Imma leave this here.... cyclopsXwolverineXjeangrey
[1:24:07] <%QueequegTheater> @dabeaminator Yeah I bet it did
[1:24:08] <+Cadwae> @AngriestPat Just got a Phoenix Protocol on my last Gambit before work. Good luck on drops my man.
[1:24:14] <%dekkitout> @rathekingofthesun You read PoX too, huh...
[1:24:14] <+6PoundsofShrimp> I'm like 920 atm, not dlc
[1:24:15] <%MegboyManuel> Legend of Acrius though, big fuck off shotgun with bird shot
[1:24:15] <%QueequegTheater> HALO'S STORY WAS GOOD YOU STUMBO
[1:24:16] <+Pyroclase> Destiny has amazing lore and truly terrible storytelling
[1:24:21] <%QueequegTheater> ^
[1:24:27] <zv1neda> ^^
[1:24:31] <%InugamiTheHound> @dabeaminator OMG I want to read more halo books because I love halo games and the books
[1:24:31] <Ion_Laser> ^^^
[1:24:33] <+DrFacilier> awkward
[1:24:33] <NiktenKing> Just like Dark Souls
[1:24:41] <+6PoundsofShrimp> I liked the Halo series
[1:24:42] <%Neo_Kaiser> The story in Halo is also simple. Stop Halo. ODST was Group up with your Squad and Reach was Defend Reach.
[1:24:42] <%nmaten> Destiny's story is so ass
[1:24:43] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:24:43] <+6PoundsofShrimp> story
[1:24:45] <+rathekingofthesun> @dekkitout ye. We bouta get some mutant orgies up in here cuz
[1:24:47] <%QueequegTheater> SHUT UP YOU LOVE IT
[1:24:52] <DFireCreations> Halo is so not serious lol
[1:24:52] <+Thomzzz> thats exactly why we love it
[1:24:57] <+6PoundsofShrimp> like the kids being kidnapped and replaced with clones designed to die
[1:24:59] <%Ranryu692> All the cool shit is in the Eric Nylund books
[1:25:01] <reddpop_> its kingdom hearts story telling with a better asthetic
[1:25:03] <Cymen90> @DFireCreations Yes it is. Dude.
[1:25:04] <Roz_Lynd> i know a couple o fuckin nerds who will tell you that story and lore are the same thing
[1:25:05] <Tucker0603> screw ya
[1:25:07] <+6PoundsofShrimp> and then raised to become spartans
[1:25:07] <%nmaten> Halo's story is at least fun
[1:25:09] <+Pyroclase> To be fair, they clearly know what the darknes sis NOW.
[1:25:11] <%Zamorouskiwhich> The games story is bad. The lore is awesome apatDab
[1:25:11] <DSD24> They are making up as they go
[1:25:11] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> Taken King had a pretty good cutscene
[1:25:12] <+Pyroclase> they have a plan.
[1:25:16] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Sargent Johnson was such a cool character
[1:25:17] <dabeaminator> I don't think you've played Halo Pat...
[1:25:18] <+Grayhammatter> filler make gun look cool
[1:25:19] <DSD24> Taken King was a awesome DLC
[1:25:20] <%Neo_Kaiser> Pat says while praising Dark Souls story and lore for the same reason.
[1:25:21] <%LiquidShake83> gun do look cool
[1:25:22] <%logoth_> Nobody plays these games for story
[1:25:24] <King_thunder365> The DAHKNESS was obviously Rick James. Duh!
[1:25:25] <+Pyroclase> The identity of the Nine is a great twist by the way
[1:25:29] <+rathekingofthesun> Imma be honest. I didn’t get into the story until after I played it high
[1:25:29] <DSD24> Everyone likes Shaxx
[1:25:30] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Taken King had a legitimately good story
[1:25:30] <%Maids4lyfe> but now they know what the darkness is
[1:25:31] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> BUT, the gun do look cool
[1:25:37] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> the best part of Destiny's story has always been anything related to the Hive and Oryx.
[1:25:38] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Do you not consider Characters part of the story?
[1:25:41] <$Timesteel> the pyramid ships have been around since before D1 they were in the concept art for the enemy racves
[1:25:48] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Like if the character writing is good?
[1:25:52] <%Maids4lyfe> learning that Shaxx is a Warlord was cool
[1:25:54] <$Timesteel> races*
[1:25:54] <+sinistersally> Yo is pat playing some Iron Banana
[1:25:57] <DFireCreations> I liked Forsaken's story :/
[1:25:57] <dabeaminator> Dark Souls lore is NOT the same as the things he's talking about.
[1:25:58] <+Grayhammatter> these medals are so edgy... what the hell LYL
[1:26:02] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Shaxx was a warlock?!
[1:26:03] <+m3chamike> Character writing is not part of the story
[1:26:10] <%dekkitout> I wonder if we can mad lib Destiny story into Kingdom Hearts and vice versa and see if there's a difference
[1:26:10] <Ion_Laser> @King_thunder365 I think you misspelled CHARLIE MURPHAY there
[1:26:16] <%QueequegTheater> @6PoundsofShrimp In fairness, Fallout 4 had great character writing but the story is still ass
[1:26:20] <%Maids4lyfe> warlord @6PoundsofShrimp not warlock
[1:26:29] <+rathekingofthesun> Like seeing it in an altered state of conscience made it all make sense
[1:26:29] <MasterDecoder> Shaxx is a big dick hero that saved the City and banged Mara Sov, Queen of the Awoken
[1:26:34] <King_thunder365> @Ion_Laser Oh yeah, I did fuck up that reference.
[1:26:34] <+m3chamike> Sometime character writing can make a decent story great, aka Mass Effect 2
[1:26:37] <%FuzzTime> I remember reading a Halo book that covered the plot of the first game and it was so poorly written I didn't know locations despite playing Halo religiously
[1:26:43] <%QueequegTheater> Saladin is just salty that Shaxx is way cooler
[1:26:51] <King_thunder365> @Ion_Laser Still, glad someone got it!
[1:26:52] <+rathekingofthesun> All of a sudden I saw wizards In Space and it made sense
[1:26:56] <DSD24> @m3chamike Mordin and Thane were awesome
[1:27:04] <Ion_Laser> @King_thunder365 SeemsGood
[1:27:06] <MasterDecoder> @QueequegTheater That's questionable
[1:27:12] <%GraceTBM> @FuzzTime Do you mean Fall of Reach or the Flood?
[1:27:13] <$realm_forge> If you take the time to get into the story its pretty cool but it does need to be more involved with the game
[1:27:13] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @m3chamike Why not tho? because there's only really 7 plots? The only thing that changes is the things around the plot like the world and people in it
[1:27:15] <%Maids4lyfe> Shaxx never takes the helmet off
[1:27:17] <%Neo_Kaiser> "Man, Fireflys story is so lame, it's just a bunch of losers on a roadtrip. Yeah the characters are amazing and the episodes are great, but that story is lame."
[1:27:18] <%FuzzTime> The Flood
[1:27:21] <%QueequegTheater> @MasterDecoder Saladin is "No Fun Allowed" made into a person
[1:27:24] <%FuzzTime> but I heard Fallof Reach was equally terrible
[1:27:28] <%legendfather_of_giants> @FuzzTime Most of the Halo books don't really cover the games at all, and are really good
[1:27:28] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @QueequegTheater That's actually fair
[1:27:31] <+sinistersally> Elmo Johns?
[1:27:34] <heartlesshealer> but baby must squeak
[1:27:40] <dabeaminator> The good Halo novels are the self contained stories set in between the games, like Contact Harvest and Cole Protocol. I can't speak for the game adaptations.
[1:27:41] <+oleron_666> good job elmo
[1:27:44] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:27:45] <%dekkitout> Wrong hood, chief
[1:27:45] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat they're a 4 stack
[1:27:45] <%LiquidShake83> use a grenade
[1:27:49] <stellaspeed10> Play
[1:27:51] <%QueequegTheater> wrong neighborhood motherfucker
[1:27:54] <%InugamiTheHound> I think the fall of reach book is better than halo reach game story
[1:27:58] <%Zamorouskiwhich> There is the Iron Banner we know and love ruuDerp
[1:27:59] <%GraceTBM> Yeah, easily the best Halo novels are the self dependent stories
[1:28:13] <$Timesteel> up against a 4 stack feelsbadman
[1:28:14] <%legendfather_of_giants> Yeah, the Reach official book sucks, Fall of Reach is pretty good
[1:28:16] <+angel949> I hate it when I turn a corner and run into the entire enemy team
[1:28:18] <DSD24> I miss the Halo Pistol
[1:28:24] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> @inugamithehound right thwr with ya
[1:28:29] <DSD24> @angel949 Its a rough feeling
[1:28:33] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat thinking that halo story is bad, meanwhile Halo Reach continues to exist
[1:28:34] <%Neo_Kaiser> I miss Halo, it's been 9 years since the last game.
[1:28:34] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> who knew Keyes was such a badass
[1:28:35] <%GraceTBM> Was the Reach official book the book version of Halo: Reach?
[1:28:35] <%QueequegTheater> SURVIVE
[1:28:49] <Ion_Laser> @GraceTBM nope
[1:28:50] <%QueequegTheater> @GraceTBM no
[1:28:56] <%logoth_> nope.avi
[1:29:00] <%GraceTBM> Good
[1:29:03] <MasterDecoder> @QueequegTheater He lost all his friends, took up a lone Vigil to guard against out-of-control nanites, and he's upset at Shaxx for disobeying orders during Six Fronts
[1:29:16] <$realm_forge> Itoo have just been running into whole teams all freakin day
[1:29:18] <MasterDecoder> I like both, so
[1:29:21] <%InugamiTheHound> @The_Lady_Alustriel the story in the game was okay but contradicts with the Spartan 2 and 3. Needler rifle never came back I love that gun.
[1:29:28] <%Maids4lyfe> I miss SIVA
[1:29:36] <+rathekingofthesun> Saladin’s just sad cause I fucked with an angry Russian machine god
[1:29:43] <%QueequegTheater> @MasterDecoder yeah but we killed the nanites and he's still a joykilling, self-righteous douche. And Shaxx was RIGHT
[1:29:43] <dabeaminator> @GraceTBM I think there's a novel adaptation of the game "Halo Reach", but the novel "Fall of Reach" was written before that game came out.
[1:29:47] <MasterDecoder> @Maids4lyfe It's still around, a little
[1:29:48] <%dekkitout> @Maids4lyfe So do the House of Devils...
[1:29:53] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[1:30:03] <Fleshlessnes> is destiny worth it in solo? i like playing by my self
[1:30:09] <%QueequegTheater> @Fleshlessnes yes
[1:30:12] <%Maids4lyfe> yeah
[1:30:16] <%Maids4lyfe> it's pretty fun solo
[1:30:23] <DFireCreations> I play solo and I like it
[1:30:23] <%GraceTBM> I read the Fall of Reach, and I was really unhappy with the Reach game's whimsical dismissal of the book
[1:30:30] <Fleshlessnes> thnx
[1:30:34] <$realm_forge> He buries his poo with that paw
[1:30:36] <DagetStreams> Bungie wrote Halo Reach without concerning themselves with exterior canon, and then 343 came in and bent over backwards to fit it into canon
[1:30:41] <%goose_attack_almanac> You look like the mouth of sauron
[1:30:46] <+rathekingofthesun> Me too it’s typically good but if you’re interested in raids you’re gonna need a crew but that’s like the 1% endgame
[1:31:00] <MasterDecoder> @QueequegTheater He's just a grizzled old man trying to hammer out the newbies into better Guardians
[1:31:01] <DagetStreams> Which resulted in: "Covenant invaded Reach and the UNSC just...covered it up"
[1:31:23] <%QueequegTheater> @MasterDecoder I just think Saladin is way less fun than Shaxx
[1:31:26] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> crucible is the true endgame anyway
[1:31:31] <%GraceTBM> Yeah, I guess it's fair to just focus on your main canon for a full game title, I just wish the game's content was anywhere near as good
[1:31:34] <MasterDecoder> @QueequegTheater Oh definitely
[1:31:41] <DFireCreations> sweat god pat
[1:31:42] <Fleshlessnes> what if i hate pvp? are the story bits and pve still worth it
[1:31:49] <%QueequegTheater> Fall of Reach is Master Chief's backstory and it details how he's basically a WH40K Ultramarine
[1:31:51] <%Neo_Kaiser> Games story supersedes a novel by some guy outside their control. The novels even needed to be patched because they got a few details wrong, like thinking Hunters are new.
[1:31:51] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> isn't Efrideet alive somewhere
[1:31:52] <dabeaminator> The weird nebulous nature of Destiny's lore confuses me given how compact the Halo lore was under Bungie.
[1:31:54] <%nmaten> nothing good comes from heated gamers pat
[1:31:55] <%Ninestempest> das a d1 map
[1:31:57] <$realm_forge> The new raid guns are fuckin sexy
[1:31:59] <+rathekingofthesun> Shaxx fucked Mara and uldren and Saladin watched nervously
[1:31:59] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> can we have her instead of Saladin
[1:32:02] <%dekkitout> I hated it when sniper-laning got huge in D1
[1:32:06] <%jaid251> Do i have to play the first destiny to play this one?
[1:32:09] <%QueequegTheater> @rathekingofthesun the helmet stayed on
[1:32:12] <%QueequegTheater> @jaid251 no
[1:32:17] <heartlesshealer> Is this D1 or D2? (the game, not the map)
[1:32:20] <%QueequegTheater> D2
[1:32:24] <DSD24> Is Mara that lady from Destiny 1 that had that brother?
[1:32:28] <%Neo_Kaiser> Man, all this talk about Halo and Destinys story but nobody is talking about the story in Anthem.
[1:32:28] <heartlesshealer> Thank you Queeques
[1:32:28] <MasterDecoder> @The_Lady_Alustriel She is, but she's off with the Pacifist Guardians
[1:32:28] <%dekkitout> Yes
[1:32:28] <%QueequegTheater> @DSD24 yes
[1:32:31] <%GraceTBM> Dog it says Destiny 2
[1:32:33] <heartlesshealer> Queequeg*
[1:32:34] <%Neo_Kaiser> lol
[1:32:37] <DSD24> @QueequegTheater Thank you
[1:32:37] <%logoth_> Haiyai
[1:32:38] <+rathekingofthesun> @queequegtheater he used his horn
[1:32:47] <%dekkitout> Does Tankis have a house?
[1:32:59] <%QueequegTheater> Taniks is the last member of the House of Judgement
[1:33:03] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> @masterdecoder was this before or after she gave us guns? because she could still possibly do that
[1:33:04] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:33:07] <%QueequegTheater> Wait no
[1:33:10] <Fleshlessnes> what if i hate pvp? are the story bits and pve still worth it solo?
[1:33:10] <+Grayhammatter> did you though?
[1:33:11] <%QueequegTheater> That's Variks
[1:33:13] <MasterDecoder> @The_Lady_Alustriel After
[1:33:24] <Ion_Laser> @Neo_Kaiser The only "story" I saw in Anthem was that live-action trailer by the District 9 director about...stuff
[1:33:27] <%GraceTBM> Yknow the Spartans in the books were basically the mega-gestapo for covertly killing revolters
[1:33:29] <%QueequegTheater> TANIKS HAS NO HOUSE
[1:33:30] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> I mean she isn't directly harming people... we are with her guns
[1:33:37] <+rathekingofthesun> Kell of kells for LIFE
[1:33:39] <%dekkitout> @QueequegTheater Taniks has no house- owes allegiance to no Kell
[1:33:42] <DFireCreations> gonna be real the only part of D2's storytelling that REALLY pisses me off is the weekly conversations from forsaken that are impossible to see anymore
[1:33:43] <%QueequegTheater> @GraceTBM more like Space Marines
[1:33:54] <%dekkitout> He is a murderer- and very good at what he does
[1:33:55] <Marhunter7> @dekkitout he is a murderer
[1:34:00] <+rathekingofthesun> Taniks abouta become the true kell tho
[1:34:00] <%GraceTBM> You're probably on the money, I'm just not familiar with space marines
[1:34:05] <%QueequegTheater> @dekkitout e is a murderer, and very good at what he does.
[1:34:22] <MasterDecoder> @The_Lady_Alustriel She was around in the background during the Red War, but went home to the Pacifist Colony after the Traveler woke up
[1:34:32] <+Pyroclase> it doesn't scramble matche sbetween matches unless they're unbalanced
[1:34:38] <%GraceTBM> I just grew up with a father who was in the military, and got a big dose of that military glorification, and looking back at the Halo universe the Spartans are very ethically dubious
[1:34:54] <MasterDecoder> @rathekingofthesun Taniks? No. Variks? He'll try
[1:34:56] <Marhunter7> well chat... weather we wanted it or not, we've stepped into war with the cabal on mars
[1:35:00] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Take his heavy! ruuMad
[1:35:10] <+Pyroclase> I'm pretty sure the Spartans are MEANT to be ethetically dubious
[1:35:15] <dabeaminator> Human government in Halo is sketchy as hell. ONI is super evil.
[1:35:17] <%QueequegTheater> @rathekingofthesun Taniks is deader than Cayde, man
[1:35:31] <%dekkitout> All sci fi governtments are uber fucked
[1:35:45] <%dekkitout> Hell, look up Destiny's New Monarchy/Concordat
[1:35:46] <%GraceTBM> Yeah, pyro, absolutely. It was jarring to see it as an adult with less rose tinted perspective
[1:35:49] <+rathekingofthesun> Isn’t taniks the old warden of the prison of elders or am I misremembering?
[1:35:56] <DSD24> Who is the best Sci Fi Government?
[1:36:04] <dabeaminator> @dekkitout I can't prove you wrong.
[1:36:05] <%GraceTBM> TNG Federation?
[1:36:08] <DFireCreations> @queequegtheater taniks is a spooky ghost now tho, cayde isnt (yet)
[1:36:12] <MasterDecoder> @rathekingofthesun That's Variks
[1:36:14] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> UNSC got really lucky that the Covenant found them when they did, otherwise there would have been a whole hell of a lot of dark shit coming out about Trebuchet
[1:36:16] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Mercy with Pat at the top of the board ruuLove
[1:36:17] <DSD24> I actually like when Destiny calls it early
[1:36:18] <BakerBrute> @DSD24 EDF Japan
[1:36:20] <%QueequegTheater> @Marhunter7 So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold
[1:36:21] <+rathekingofthesun> Ahh my bad
[1:36:34] <DSD24> @BakerBrute EDF is pretty good
[1:36:36] <+PerrinIsDead> Nah Federation is corrupt in DS9
[1:36:39] <Saiyza> Oh no, the dreaded opposite bell curve.
[1:36:56] <Cymen90> Remember that Halo short that showed becoming genetically superior also meant getting blue eyes? That series did not age well.
[1:37:04] <%Keeble24> Keeble24 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! Heyo Pat! Big 30! Always found games you play worth playing myself. Ever considered playing Daemon X Machina?
[1:37:04] <+rathekingofthesun> Oh god ds9 is the only Star Trek I’m into 😓
[1:37:08] <dabeaminator> Yeah the UNSC was gonna erupt into a civil war right before the aaaaaliens showed up.
[1:37:13] <Ion_Laser> @PerrinIsDead It's fine in TNG, but corrupt as hell in DS9
[1:37:13] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> isn't it mostly Section 31 in DS9 that's evil
[1:37:26] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> oh wait no nvm, I forgot aboijt that one two parter
[1:37:28] <+PerrinIsDead> DS9 is great, my fav Trek
[1:37:35] <DSD24> Daemon X Machnia is pretty fun
[1:37:37] <%GraceTBM> Did the books ever go into the nature of the civil war motivations?
[1:37:41] <DSD24> The story is lame tho
[1:37:42] <zv1neda> but the clunk makes it better
[1:37:42] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat I mean, this doesn't mean you're quitting Warframe, just go back for new content
[1:37:44] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> Wait that was Starfleet though not the Federation
[1:37:45] <%QueequegTheater> cheer500 Taniks has no House. He kneels before no banner, owes allegiance to no Kell. He is a murderer, and very good at what he does. I have been tracking him since Wolves broke their chains, yes? Now Taniks works for Wolf Pack, but not for long.
[1:37:47] <%QueequegTheater> reward A Cheer shared Rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[1:38:12] <%QueequegTheater> Destiny 1 had some great memes
[1:38:16] <+Pyroclase> Thanks?! @QueequegTheater
[1:38:19] <Cymen90> Also, can we just acknowledge how STUPID the title “Masterchief” is? Might as well call him “Uber-boss”
[1:38:21] <%Zamorouskiwhich> I've... never gotten this map ruuBlank
[1:38:21] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> hey Sony, can you take this map back pls
[1:38:22] <+rathekingofthesun> I though taniks was up with is own house of judgement?
[1:38:25] <Marhunter7> @QueequegTheater you just never quit do you...
[1:38:32] <dabeaminator> I know DS9 is supposed to get good, but I can't get past season 1. I've bounced off it three times, and it's the only Trek series I haven't seen multiple times through..
[1:38:32] <%GraceTBM> Master Chief Petty Seargeant
[1:38:37] <+Pyroclase> WTF I've never seen this map before
[1:38:38] <%GraceTBM> It's just a shortening of his rank
[1:38:39] <%QueequegTheater> @Cymen90 It's literally a naval rank. Master Chief Petty Officer
[1:38:41] <%dekkitout> @Cymen90 Right, cause Big Boss is fine...
[1:38:46] <%GraceTBM> Petty officer lol
[1:38:51] <%GraceTBM> I'm nailing it
[1:38:53] <%Neo_Kaiser> Ask Pat about Star Trek having characters turn into lizards and breed.
[1:38:57] <%Keeble24> Woah generous @QueequegTheater
[1:39:04] <%QueequegTheater> Yup, that's a real rank that exists in the U.S. Navy
[1:39:14] <+PerrinIsDead> DS9 gets good after the first few episodes imo
[1:39:18] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> @dabeaminator it took me several tries as well. the payoff is well worth it. remember no Trek series has a good start
[1:39:22] <+Pyroclase> Theshold < Threshold kids
[1:39:35] <%QueequegTheater> It's the highest enlisted rank in the navy and coast guard
[1:39:39] <%GraceTBM> It's like Pat wants to double jump right into headshot range
[1:39:41] <%Xooler67> I'm not really into shooters and I don't have friends who play this, is it safe to say I wouldn't like this game?
[1:39:43] <%Zamorouskiwhich> This map looks like its made to freak out people who look at the radar too much. Like me NotLikeThis
[1:39:46] <+MageInSpanish> Hey Pat I just started playing ff14 again, I first played back in ARR and dropped it after a couple of months. Do you have any tips for leveling? Most efficient way of leveling or other stuff to look out for?
[1:39:52] <Ion_Laser> @rathekingofthesun Variks has his own house of judgement.
[1:40:03] <%QueequegTheater> @MageInSpanish do your roulettes every day
[1:40:08] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> this map is way too tight for how fast pc plays compared to console
[1:40:11] <+rathekingofthesun> Thanks! @ion_laser
[1:40:17] <%GraceTBM> It's very much a shooter Xooler, but it's free, so you could just try it
[1:40:26] <%QueequegTheater> @rathekingofthesun Variks is the only member of the House of Judgement
[1:40:30] <dabeaminator> Yeah Master Chief is a rank. His "name" is Sierra 117 or just John.
[1:40:47] <Ion_Laser> @rathekingofthesun no problem!
[1:40:48] <%QueequegTheater> His name is John-117, technically
[1:40:52] <DFireCreations> john Halo
[1:40:59] <%Xooler67> @gracetbm thx for the input
[1:40:59] <%QueequegTheater> It was a weird thing with the Spartan-IIs
[1:41:01] <%Neo_Kaiser> At AUS PAX we have multiple Halo: Reach tournaments. Cause that game has a 5 minute setup. Overwatch? 8 hour setup.
[1:41:03] <+rathekingofthesun> John halo man
[1:41:10] <%Keeble24> My first time actually seeing the PvP in Destiny 2; looks interesting
[1:41:11] <+rathekingofthesun> Mr. John halo man
[1:41:12] <%InugamiTheHound> His name is John, Sierra 117 is code name "master chief" is his rank
[1:41:13] <%dekkitout> John Halo Masterchief III
[1:41:16] <morganagod> Pat, what's your ingame controller sensitivity set to? You seem to do a pretty good job keeping track of your targets. (better than me on controller at least.)
[1:41:18] <+PerrinIsDead> John 316
[1:41:25] <%QueequegTheater> I'm still unsure if Pat knew his name was John when he called him John Halo
[1:41:26] <%LiquidShake83> you can win
[1:41:36] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> lmao right
[1:41:50] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> it seemed like he knew, but I just don't know
[1:41:55] <%LiquidShake83> same
[1:42:15] <%dekkitout> Delyeeted straight to the recycle bin
[1:42:19] <%Neo_Kaiser> Fucko Pops
[1:42:26] <Cymen90> Don’t remind me of the on-the-nose Bible stuff in Halo....
[1:42:28] <%LiquidShake83> good d
[1:43:00] <dabeaminator> I got the impression that his name is supposed to show that he isn't super special. The only reason he was so important in the war was because he was the only Spartan around, and he happened to have Cortana after the fall of Reach.
[1:43:40] <%GraceTBM> They were essentially dehumanized and having an anonymousish designation an important step
[1:43:43] <+rathekingofthesun> I’d take chris boulder punching from RE over John halo man any day
[1:43:45] <%Neo_Kaiser> But then 343 retconned Halo to say there were dozens of Spartans hanging around.
[1:43:47] <%QueequegTheater> @dabeaminator In one of the books (I think) Cortana straight up says he wasn't the smartest, strongest, fastest, toughest, or best leader. Just the luckiest
[1:43:55] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> the real heroes were the Spartan 3s
[1:43:55] <%dekkitout> Academically speaking, yeah. Pessimistically speaking, hell no.
[1:44:01] <%InugamiTheHound> For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.-John 1:17
[1:44:07] <%GraceTBM> Oh hell yeah, Chris is better any day of the week
[1:44:09] <Marhunter7> @dabeaminator basically, he just insanely good luck
[1:44:10] <%Neo_Kaiser> The real heroes were the Halos we made along the way.
[1:44:22] <%GraceTBM> @InugamiTheHound how is that related to halo thematically
[1:44:23] <%QueequegTheater> @Neo_Kaiser Well those are mostly the shitty Spartan-IVs
[1:44:46] <%LiquidShake83> lol
[1:44:46] <%GraceTBM> It's lame that the "luck" doesn't really seem like an interesting character other than that he has plot armor
[1:44:46] <%InugamiTheHound> @GraceTBM John 117 that's the bible verse
[1:44:47] <dabeaminator> @QueequegTheater That's at the start of Halo 3 as well. She just liked the cut of his jib.
[1:44:51] <%QueequegTheater> yeyeyeye
[1:44:53] <%Ninestempest> LUL
[1:44:54] <%dekkitout> He said the thing!
[1:44:57] <DFireCreations> yeyeye
[1:44:57] <Ion_Laser> :D
[1:44:58] <%QueequegTheater> I CLAPPED
[1:45:03] <Ion_Laser> YE YE EY
[1:45:04] <%tortugatime214> tortugatime214 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:45:05] <%Ninestempest> I CLAPPED WHEN I HEARD IT
[1:45:09] <+rathekingofthesun> YEYEYEYEYE!
[1:45:12] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Taniks, yesssss?
[1:45:14] <Ion_Laser> I fucking loved that strike in D1
[1:45:14] <NiktenKing> WHETHER WE WANTED IT...
[1:45:17] <%GraceTBM> @InugamiTheHound I know. Who is jesus in this analogy, Master Chief certainly isn't in halo
[1:45:17] <%dekkitout> Dee Bradley Baker voiced Taniks, and boy do I miss him FeelsBadMan
[1:45:28] <%nmaten> thats a warframe
[1:45:29] <%InugamiTheHound> @QueequegTheater man spartan 4s look cool but they shit compared to spartan 3 and 2
[1:45:33] <IntrepidEye> @Neo_Kaiser Chief was never the only spartan ever from the very beginning. Theres always other Spartans out there
[1:45:42] <+FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat Oh, there's a bug. Apparently doing gambit reckoning with the weakest motes on warlock drops titan gear
[1:45:45] <%LiquidShake83> sick
[1:45:48] <Marhunter7> idk destiny repeated dialogue memes are a thing, but i can't help but find them slightly hilarious
[1:45:51] <+FennecZephyr> So if your warlock is higher level than your titan
[1:45:52] <%Zamorouskiwhich> "Lets just throw some stuff from another exotic on this sparrow, no one will notice"
[1:46:08] <%QueequegTheater> @InugamiTheHound Well yeah, they;re like Navy Seals as opposed to the WH40K space marines that the IIs and IIIs are
[1:46:17] <startstoprepeat> that's on the fix list for the next patch
[1:46:19] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat you don't get gear from Reckoning?
[1:46:20] <%QueequegTheater> They're even shitty IN-STORY
[1:46:22] <%GraceTBM> That's a great comparison, Queeq
[1:46:25] <%LiquidShake83> play gambit next
[1:46:30] <DSD24> A badass who will get shot
[1:46:36] <mayorrev> is this like Team Fortress 2
[1:46:37] <%dekkitout> Holy shit- this guy doesn't scares of nothing?!
[1:46:40] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> I thought the 3's were all underpowered and disposable compared to 2's
[1:46:55] <thegreenbenis> @AngriestPat Hey I got into Destiny 2 because of you.
[1:46:57] <NiktenKing> Going for C... just like Randy
[1:46:57] <%InugamiTheHound> @QueequegTheater reading ghost of Onyx and learning the truth about spartan 3 programs is pretty nasty same with 2s but not as bad.
[1:47:08] <+rathekingofthesun> Think that’s it for tonight. Have a good stream everyone! Hope you do well pat! Shoutouts to @queequegtheater and @dekkitout for indulging me in my nerd shit 😂
[1:47:11] <%QueequegTheater> @The_Lady_Alustriel No, they were very similar but way lower rate of success
[1:47:15] <%legendfather_of_giants> @The_Lady_Alustriel 3's are normal SM's compared to Terminator marines that are 2's
[1:47:21] <mayorrev> hehe benis
[1:47:35] <dabeaminator> None of the spartan generations should be compared to Space Marines. Spartans are recon troops and special operatives. Space Marines are sledgehammers that you dump onto planets you don't like.
[1:47:36] <%GraceTBM> Normal SMs?
[1:47:36] <%LiquidShake83> you almost won that
[1:47:42] <%GraceTBM> space marines nvm
[1:47:44] <Deofiro> You are all just making me curious as to what Spartan I dudes looked like
[1:47:46] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> @queequegtheater right. no full mjolnir suits and given impossible missions
[1:47:48] <DFireCreations> I haven watched Halo legends in a while but wasnt there something where they'd steal the babies from their parents and replace them with a clone baby so nobody noticed
[1:47:55] <Marhunter7> @QueequegTheater aren't most spartan 1s also basically just a bunch of cripples because of how jacked up the experiments to enhance them turned out?
[1:47:58] <%GraceTBM> @DFireCreations absolutely
[1:48:00] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> @legendfather_of_giants good analogy
[1:48:04] <%QueequegTheater> @Marhunter7 yes
[1:48:05] <p_squid> Is this console or PC?
[1:48:08] <%dekkitout> Indulging people in nerd shit helps me get my buzz down and remember that my project is due in ~2 hours... monkaS
[1:48:11] <IntrepidEye> @The_Lady_Alustriel They are just as good as the 2's but they died young and inexperienced and usually didn't get Mjolnir
[1:48:13] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Deofiro They're all freaks because the process had horrible side effects and left them all cripples
[1:48:20] <%tortugatime214> @angriestpat just curious what’s the time for you?
[1:48:26] <%Neo_Kaiser> If they could clone kids to be Spartans, why not just use the cloned kids instead of the real ones?
[1:48:26] <Deofiro> Dont forget the clones were designed to die soon
[1:48:30] <mayorrev> STAND ON THE FREAKIN POINT YOU MORON
[1:48:31] <%QueequegTheater> @dabeaminator I meant more that IVs are uplifted adult soldiers but IIs and IIIs were trained and modified as children
[1:48:34] <%GraceTBM> 12 38 for him i think
[1:48:35] <%LiquidShake83> u is
[1:48:37] <+sinistersally> ah hes rocking the chaperone
[1:48:49] <%QueequegTheater> Which is pretty close to how the Space Marines are made
[1:48:50] <dabeaminator> Ah, I see, that's a fair comparison then.
[1:48:50] <%tortugatime214> Ah
[1:48:55] <mayorrev> PLANT YERSELF ON THE POINT, MISTER
[1:48:59] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> @intrepideye yeah, I may have miscommunicated what I meant when I said underpowered
[1:49:11] <%QueequegTheater> And it's also a good comparison for why Chief kicks the absolute living shit out of Locke in 5
[1:49:16] <%GraceTBM> I mean, the 4s armor couldn't take a single plasma pistol shot without dying
[1:49:18] <%InugamiTheHound> spartan 3 were made for suicide missions and they pumped them full of chemicals to make powerful and full of anger and their armor were weaker but had some stealth elements in it.
[1:49:19] <DSD24> Crush!
[1:49:29] <DSD24> Doing them Urien tackles
[1:49:33] <%GraceTBM> Fuck that was onyx, not halo 4 and 5
[1:49:41] <%Keeble24> damn! that was good Pat
[1:49:46] <%QueequegTheater> Reminder that Noble Six was as dangerous and MC
[1:49:48] <%dekkitout> I saw no such thing John Cena
[1:49:48] <%QueequegTheater> *as MC
[1:49:51] <%Neo_Kaiser> That's right, fuck Halo 4 and 5.
[1:49:54] <%GraceTBM> That fight between Chief and Locke was the limpest thing ever
[1:49:55] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> damn, please don't make me like striker titans @dsd24
[1:50:08] <%QueequegTheater> @GraceTBM I liked it because I hated Locke from the start
[1:50:11] <dabeaminator> God, don't even mention Halo 5. What an embarrassing trainwreck.
[1:50:15] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> hey the Didact was cool, you just had to read 3 books Kappa
[1:50:27] <%QueequegTheater> At least Halo 4 had some character development for Chief
[1:50:31] <%InugamiTheHound> @Neo_Kaiser they made a flash clone of the kid that died a few days later and Oni made a cover story up on why they died when they were ones who kidnaped them and lied to parents many of them never seeing their kids ever again.
[1:50:32] <%Saltmeisterr> how good is the dress up ur Barbie game in destiny chat?
[1:50:33] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> they were pretty good books tbh
[1:50:39] <%GraceTBM> @QueequegTheater I mostly meant the choreography and how weak their strikes looked, it was like a slap fight
[1:50:46] <%dekkitout> That play was Kiteman worthy- Hell yeah!
[1:50:47] <Frostydough1> guys hollow knight is $8 plus tax on PS4 right now if anyone is interested
[1:50:47] <%QueequegTheater> @GraceTBM yup
[1:50:48] <DSD24> @The_Lady_Alustriel Its all I think of when I see those Titan's doing those tackles
[1:50:51] <MasterDecoder> @Saltmeisterr Decent
[1:50:57] <dabeaminator> As soon as you bring the Forerunners back you ruin the mystique that made them interesting and unknowable in the original games.
[1:51:02] <Deofiro> How many titans have you seen without One eyed mask
[1:51:09] <%GraceTBM> I get that it's like a "book detail" but they were super fast! not marine kaijus bumping each other around
[1:51:10] <%QueequegTheater> All of them
[1:51:14] <MasterDecoder> @GraceTBM Chief took it easy on Locke
[1:51:31] <%Saltmeisterr> I assume u can't really customize the visuals of ur gun?
[1:51:32] <Deofiro> I said WITHOUT
[1:51:34] <%InugamiTheHound> @QueequegTheater The stuff about fore runner and didact was awesome
[1:51:41] <Marhunter7> @Deofiro i thought one eye masks were welded onto titan's heads as a default option
[1:51:45] <%QueequegTheater> Yeah I got the impression Chief could have literally ripped Locke in half with his bare hands
[1:51:55] <%dekkitout> Gonna see a lot less OEM given today's TWAB...
[1:51:57] <%Keeble24> hey guys, is it worth getting Witcher 3 for the switch if you've never played it before? or is it worth the better graphics on other consoles? i don't have a powerful PC
[1:51:57] <%QueequegTheater> IIs are just on another level compared to IVs
[1:52:04] <WhereIsWill> pat out here on FIRE tho
[1:52:05] <%GraceTBM> Maybe not her armor, but he probably coulda literally thrown her off the platform
[1:52:06] <%Ninestempest> DOES IKORA KNOW YOU"RE THIS GOOD?
[1:52:08] <%MegboyManuel> GAMER,GOD in the house
[1:52:09] <Marhunter7> @Deofiro i was unaware the option to not use it existed

[1:52:18] <%tri3dgE027> Thanks for the gift-sub RPGAyaya @StridentSong
[1:52:19] <%LiquidShake83> lol
[1:52:21] <%QueequegTheater> JEBAITED
[1:52:24] <dabeaminator> @Keeble24 Get it on something that can run it properly, it's worth it.

[1:52:27] <DSD24> @Keeble24 If you prefer handheld gaming than you should go for the Switch Version
[1:52:37] <%QueequegTheater> "timetolive"
[1:52:38] <%Neo_Kaiser> Pats excited for a 10 streak? I've gotten dozens of Perfection Medals.
[1:52:48] <%GraceTBM> lV's were basically just really good marines they recruited and gave baby-assist power armor, right?
[1:52:48] <Roz_Lynd> well look at your big dick
[1:52:52] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> wasn't Takana from Fireteam Osiris previously a nerdy scientist? or... Vale? no way she could take on any odfblue team
[1:53:01] <MasterDecoder> Damn
[1:53:10] <%Neo_Kaiser> lol
[1:53:13] <DSD24> Hey was Halo ODST good?
[1:53:14] <%vixenpunch> vixenpunch subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! I will give this man more money every month
[1:53:15] <%QueequegTheater> @GraceTBM Yeah. That fight was like a Navy Seal trying to fistfight Kratos
[1:53:17] <thegreenbenis> THE WEAK FEAR THE STRONG
[1:53:20] <%Neo_Kaiser> ODST was good
[1:53:21] <%TimetodiveLTX> i see how it happed
[1:53:21] <%GraceTBM> lol
[1:53:25] <%Keeble24> @dabeaminator oh i guess it does matter seeing as how its a reallly long game
[1:53:27] <%vixenpunch> Always worth
[1:53:28] <DFireCreations> @dsd24 yes
[1:53:30] <%TimetodiveLTX> happened*
[1:53:32] <%Ranryu692> ODST was good for exactly 1 playthrough
[1:53:38] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Neo_Kaiser wut
[1:53:38] <%Ferakin> ODST was pretty neat, had a few failings but totally worth a play
[1:53:38] <MasterDecoder> @The_Lady_Alustriel *Tanaka, Vale was the nerd
[1:53:39] <%GraceTBM> ODST was a fun curiosity, but it's a much slower game
[1:53:39] <+Nogopharo> are you using top tree? it's helpful in the super you can do blink movements to close down on enemies faster.
[1:53:41] <%MalekDracarus> ODST was fine
[1:53:43] <%GraceTBM> 1 playthrough, absolutely
[1:53:44] <dabeaminator> 44 GB into my 79 GB download. Ugh, come on Destiny 2, speed up.
[1:53:44] <%Neo_Kaiser> ODST is great for multiple playthroughs
[1:53:48] <DSD24> I always wanted to play that one but never got to it
[1:53:49] <%Keeble24> @DSD24 hmmmm i guess thats the main thing to consider
[1:54:00] <%InugamiTheHound> @The_Lady_Alustriel I don't care about any of spartan 4s expect for Throne from spartan ops because he was only one in the cut scenes I can remember
[1:54:00] <startstoprepeat> keep an eye out for an opening shot/snapshot bite of the fox, they're nutty
[1:54:06] <%Ferakin> If you do a 4-player co-op run, everyone spawns in at different locations in the city at the beginning
[1:54:08] <Marhunter7> @The_Lady_Alustriel i mean, most spartan 4s wouldn't stand a chance against blue team... thats like captain america going up against a freaking 40k space marine
[1:54:12] <Deofiro> Pat have you tried getting the free chest in Last Wish raid
[1:54:13] <DSD24> @Keeble24 Do you have a PS4? cause if you prefer graphics than go for that one
[1:54:14] <%MalekDracarus> Vidmasters were fun
[1:54:16] <%dekkitout> I really, really, REALLY want an smg with subsistence+ambitious assassin...
[1:54:17] <DFireCreations> odst has a cool atmosphere none of the other games have
[1:54:18] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> @masterdecoder typing on mobile is difficult. and thank you, I couldn't remember. I read that book too
[1:54:20] <%GraceTBM> I felt like ODST was a very similar gameplay loop to regular Halo, but a lot more tedious and more hiding
[1:54:23] <dabeaminator> ODST is DLC for Halo 3. It's fantastic, but it does feel like an expansion rather than a full game.
[1:54:44] <$realm_forge> Did paige ever figure out what gamer goo is?
[1:54:46] <%QueequegTheater> I won't, am poor
[1:54:58] <%QueequegTheater> But also bad at not spending money, so who knows
[1:54:58] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> @marhunter7 oh absolutely, I just wanted to establish the broadest possible range of skillsets.
[1:55:07] <MasterDecoder> @The_Lady_Alustriel I haven't read a single book, lol I just like Vale a lot
[1:55:07] <Marhunter7> @The_Lady_Alustriel you are not wrong though
[1:55:07] <%TimetodiveLTX> same tbh
[1:55:12] <%Keeble24> @DSD24 i do! it'll be worth playing with better graphics then!
[1:55:36] <%TimetodiveLTX> this stream is worth the sub
[1:55:39] <%QueequegTheater> @The_Lady_Alustriel Yeah, my headcanon to rationalize that awful fight was the Chief literally had to struggle to not literally kill Locke with each punch
[1:55:39] <%Keeble24> @DSD24 thanks!
[1:55:41] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> @masterdecoder shes pretty cool in that book! I remember marking out when I saw her in game
[1:55:45] <wasalujaco> so i guess i have to ask
[1:55:56] <%vixenpunch> I can’t believe upon completion of the vow erinas vow gets even MORE impact and range
[1:55:56] <DSD24> @Keeble24 I hoped I helped! hope you like Witcher 3
[1:56:00] <%QueequegTheater> Halo good, Pat big dumb
[1:56:00] <wasalujaco> is shadowkeep better than forsaken?
[1:56:01] <%GraceTBM> I bet Spartan 2s could pretty much ora ora things
[1:56:03] <%vixenpunch> That’s crazy to me
[1:56:05] <DSD24> The Car?
[1:56:16] <Deofiro> What's a good roll for Claws of the Wolf? I got one with Outlaw + Kill Clip
[1:56:22] <Marhunter7> Vale and nathan fillion were the only good members of fire team osiris (character wise)
[1:56:23] <DSD24> :D
[1:56:24] <%vixenpunch> The bars are full on it already
[1:56:26] <%TimetodiveLTX> i want a monte cristo
[1:56:27] <%Neo_Kaiser> I don't trust a game that doesn't give me server details.
[1:56:45] <%Keeble24> @DSD24 yes! big help! thank you!
[1:56:49] <%Teintstein> what's up y'all
[1:56:52] <%GraceTBM> I keep seeing monte cristos on menus but they never say if they're deep fried and that's what I really want
[1:56:56] <%purelyplum> chat has someone told pat about the teleport during the super so he doesn't just hover at people getting shot up?
[1:56:59] <DSD24> @Teintstein Hello!
[1:57:01] <%legendfather_of_giants> @wasalujaco combined with New Light I would say so, but on it's own it's not nearly as good. Forsaken story is like 3 times as long
[1:57:04] <NiktenKing> Monte Carlo... like the method of probabilities
[1:57:04] <+DismalDavid> they didnt win
[1:57:11] <%dekkitout> Monte Carlo is an ar that recharges your melee cooldown for each bullet hit, or can refresh it on a kill- in short it invalidates the strength stat...
[1:57:13] <%QueequegTheater> Fun fact: Chief's Mjolnir armor is so powerful that he doesn't actually have to move, it responds to unconscious movements that happen when he thinks about moving
[1:57:23] <BlindGato> got DUNKED
[1:57:27] <%QueequegTheater> The armor almost killed a normal soldier
[1:57:27] <NiktenKing> Which is why it was original a VoG exclusive weapon.
[1:57:28] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat you know you can R3 teleport in Super right?
[1:57:28] <Punisher7771> wait heavenly?
[1:57:28] <Tucker0603> wait...headass
[1:57:36] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> @queequegtheater Yeah that makes way too much sense. Spartan 2s can rip tanks apart I'm fairly sure. last time I checked Buck is the only tank on Osiris
[1:57:37] <Tucker0603> I thi k that's heavenly
[1:57:39] <%dekkitout> Chill there, Tex
[1:57:46] <DFireCreations> chief's mjolnir armor has negative latency then?
[1:57:50] <Marhunter7> @QueequegTheater i'd hope so, the stuff weighs like 1000 lbs
[1:57:53] <%GraceTBM> essentially, yeah
[1:57:58] <%QueequegTheater> @The_Lady_Alustriel Yeah Buck is cool because Nathan FIllion
[1:57:58] <%dekkitout> @DFireCreations And a cup holder
[1:58:06] <%Maids4lyfe> mjolnir armor is the stadia
[1:58:14] <%QueequegTheater> @Maids4lyfe holy shit
[1:58:17] <%QueequegTheater> he's right
[1:58:18] <%Neo_Kaiser> Pat's excited for the Stadia
[1:58:20] <%Keeble24> @AngriestPat Have you gotten to meet that Macho Man Randy Savage yet? LUL
[1:58:23] <DFireCreations> ok 2 of my friends have told me this but I dont have the lore knowledge to confirm
[1:58:31] <%vixenpunch> PogChamp
[1:58:34] <+DismalDavid> i see pat is playing the best class
[1:58:34] <%Teintstein> Teintstein subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! @AngriestPat first time catching your stream in a few weeks - what did I miss
[1:58:35] <%TimetodiveLTX> i love that it's just the battle rifle
[1:58:40] <%Keeble24> lmao Grandma's coat
[1:58:45] <DSD24> I still love that podcast video of just Woolie saying Stadia and losing his shit
[1:58:47] <%GraceTBM> Mjolnir2 is kinda like the Stadia 2 cause the initial Mjolnir tried power broadcasting and it was shitty
[1:58:53] <%Neo_Kaiser> Spartans armour jerks off the users during combat.
[1:58:56] <%QueequegTheater> @DFireCreations ?
[1:58:58] <DFireCreations> apparently chief's armor has some way of keeping him in a perpetual state of post-nut clarity
[1:59:12] <%vixenpunch> I’m happy to see the famous day of defeat player snapshotking transitioning well into the upper echelon of destiny 2 pvp
[1:59:12] <%Maids4lyfe> he didn't even know what hit him
[1:59:15] <%InugamiTheHound> master chief almost killed a guy on accident at the gym when he first got enhanced
[1:59:23] <%GraceTBM> The spartans probably barely know what sex is so no sexual distractions there
[1:59:24] <%QueequegTheater> @DFireCreations Oh yeah, that's what Cortana does. She literally makes his nervous system faster
[1:59:30] <dabeaminator> I can't wait for 343 to bring back the classic artstyle for Infinite in a desperate bid to please old fans, only to realize that the real problem is their terrible writing.
[1:59:36] <+StrawberryPantsu> Jeez Pat is still going?
[1:59:37] <%QueequegTheater> But it's not actually jerking him off
[1:59:40] <%GraceTBM> I always thought he totally killed that guy in the boxing ring
[1:59:46] <DFireCreations> I have hope for infinite
[1:59:47] <%Neo_Kaiser> Nah, the problem with 343s Halo is that the gameplay is lame.
[1:59:48] <%Maids4lyfe> pat's doing real good
[1:59:50] <%TimetodiveLTX> close enough
[1:59:51] <%InugamiTheHound> IMO DMR>>>>Battle Rifle
[1:59:57] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> weird I love the gameplay of 5
[2:00:01] <KingsVisage> @AngriestPat Have you done Shattered Throne yet? And do you plan on doing the Shadowkeep dungeon when that comes out?
[2:00:04] <wasalujaco> DMR is hot
[2:00:07] <+StrawberryPantsu> Didn't 343 make Reach?
[2:00:14] <%purelyplum> Yee he did the tele jump crendorLurk
[2:00:17] <%Neo_Kaiser> lol what? Bungie made Reach.
[2:00:17] <Deofiro> What USNC gun would be a good legendary, and which Covenant gun would be an exotic in Destiny?
[2:00:17] <%TimetodiveLTX> >cortana will never regulate your nervous system
[2:00:17] <wasalujaco> no
[2:00:18] <dabeaminator> Bungie made Reach.
[2:00:21] <wasalujaco> bungie made reach
[2:00:23] <+StrawberryPantsu> Welp
[2:00:29] <wasalujaco> great game
[2:00:29] <%Neo_Kaiser> The Scarab gun in Halo 2.
[2:00:30] <%GraceTBM> I can't blame 4 and 5 for wanting to let you do more than move and shoot and grenade and equipment
[2:00:31] <%QueequegTheater> I really like Halo 4's, and at least that's a respectable opinion (if somewhat divisive), but I haven't met anyone who like 5
[2:00:32] <DFireCreations> they've been doing a good job communicating with the fans recently and they seem to have a solid direction with what they wanna do with infinite
[2:00:33] <%legendfather_of_giants> @KingsVisage if he hasn't, he has to for Izanagi
[2:00:33] <wasalujaco> favorite story
[2:00:35] <Marhunter7> @StrawberryPantsu reach was the last halo game bungie made, think it was also right after they split with microsoft
[2:00:35] <Pompadourius> Is this Boneless Warframe?
[2:00:35] <+StrawberryPantsu> 4 was eh
[2:00:43] <%InugamiTheHound> halo 5's single player was so bad and MP maps are forgettable. We haven't had good memorable maps since halo 3
[2:00:50] <KingsVisage> truuue, i forgot about that step for izanagi
[2:00:55] <DFireCreations> I like 4 campaign, not multiplayer
[2:00:55] <%Neo_Kaiser> Reach and ODST had great maps.
[2:01:02] <dabeaminator> I remember a lot of good missions in Reach.
[2:01:09] <DFireCreations> I like 5 multiplayer, not campaign
[2:01:11] <+sinistersally> you got to legend, you didn't max it
[2:01:11] <%purelyplum> Awesome ending careers too on top of the board
[2:01:12] <%QueequegTheater> Reach had the best campaign
[2:01:12] <%Maids4lyfe> YOU NEED MORE PAT
[2:01:14] <%GraceTBM> I thought the weapons, (at least the human ones) in 5 looked nice and felt satisfying, but the story was nonsense
[2:01:15] <%QueequegTheater> SURVIVE
[2:01:17] <%Maids4lyfe> MORE PERDITIONS
[2:01:21] <%dekkitout> Well folks, Pat was SO GOOD he's banned from crucible SeriousSloth
[2:01:23] <+SoundShower> I think Pat might be hooked you know.
[2:01:24] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> @queequegtheater right here! although I like stuff like mantle and the general speed more than boosting. also the slide is really good
[2:01:30] <%InugamiTheHound> @QueequegTheater reach and halo 3 were so good
[2:01:38] <%QueequegTheater> @The_Lady_Alustriel not the combat, the story
[2:01:39] <dabeaminator> Nah Halo 2 had the best campaign in my opinion, but Reach's was really good.
[2:01:51] <%QueequegTheater> Halo 2 was half a story
[2:01:52] <DSD24> I really like Halo 2
[2:01:55] <%GraceTBM> Reach's multiplayer was a lot of fun even if I didn't care for the campaign story
[2:02:06] <%vixenpunch> I’m glad that destiny 2 gives you dedicated inventory and chat downtime in the form of an hour long loading screen
[2:02:08] <%Neo_Kaiser> Halo 2 was two half games merged together.
[2:02:09] <%QueequegTheater> @GraceTBM Your subjective opinion is wrong
[2:02:09] <%vixenpunch> To go into any zone
[2:02:19] <%InugamiTheHound> I love how the chat cares more about halo than destiny 2 LOL
[2:02:27] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> @queequegtheater big whoops. I'm on my phone, it's a little difficult to track. then yes, we share the same opinion. that one mission on Sanghelios was good
[2:02:45] <%Neo_Kaiser> Reach had a great campaign, multiplayer and Firefight mode.
[2:02:47] <%Keeble24> Destiny 2 doesn't have crossplay yet huh?
[2:02:54] <Marhunter7> @dabeaminator only problem with halo 2's campaign was the bad check points *PTSD flash back to getting check pointed in the cross hairs of a jackel sniper on legendary*
[2:02:56] <%QueequegTheater> @Keeble24 and likely never will
[2:03:03] <%QueequegTheater> It has cross save tho
[2:03:06] <%GraceTBM> I was always annoyed that so many levels in Halo 2 made you fight the flood with mostly covenant weapons, which i never liked that much
[2:03:12] <DFireCreations> the last infinite trailer made me excited, imo they make you care more about that pilot fellow than halo 5 did for literally every character in that game
[2:03:17] <%Keeble24> @QueequegTheater Sony still being a hardass LUL
[2:03:19] <%vixenpunch> Nice looking shader though
[2:03:27] <%InugamiTheHound> "sir finishing this fight"-John 117 and game ends right there
[2:03:37] <%QueequegTheater> Because Shaxx is way better than Saladin
[2:03:44] <%purelyplum> Should be popping those boons before every match from shaxx so you can build up token supply
[2:03:44] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> PC is just too different from console D2, crossplay won't happen. at the very least not for crucible
[2:03:45] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat The helmet stayed on
[2:04:12] <Deofiro> Bygones is an awesome pulse rifle
[2:04:21] <dabeaminator> I don't mind Halo 2 being "half a story" since Halo 3 exists, and it finished that story in a satisfying way.
[2:04:22] <%Neo_Kaiser> Is everybody getting the limited edition for Doom so that you can get the wearable helmet and make sure it stays on?
[2:04:24] <%Keeble24> welp, time to save for a PC
[2:04:29] <DFireCreations> halo 2 had too much "stand on this big moving platform for 5 minutes"
[2:04:45] <%GraceTBM> Idk, published by bethesda, it might be a moldy helmet
[2:04:48] <%Aeoneth> pretty sure its 9999
[2:04:50] <%purelyplum> Just buy em from shaxx, infinite
[2:04:53] <%GraceTBM> dfire you're absolutely right
[2:04:54] <%dekkitout> I'm more excited for Doomguy to probably punch god in the dick
[2:05:03] <%Neo_Kaiser> The change in the health system in Halo 2 kinda ruined 2 and 3.
[2:05:22] <%cvp5127> just one more
[2:05:32] <%Teintstein> interesting
[2:05:38] <Marhunter7> Halo 2 had some of the best stupid glitches in a FPS ever
[2:05:41] <%Neo_Kaiser> Did Pat kickstart Indivisible?
[2:05:46] <+DismalDavid> the fact that it whips
[2:05:48] <Marhunter7> its physics system was so busted
[2:05:50] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Woolie has really weird (read:wrong) ideas about what makes RPGs good, doesn't he
[2:05:51] <%MegboyManuel> gun look fucking baller too
[2:05:55] <dabeaminator> I think the health system in 2 and 3 was fine. Easier than the health system in CE, but not inherently worse. It's balanced by your shields going down way faster.
[2:05:56] <%InugamiTheHound> "I am monument to all your sins"-GraveMind halo 2
[2:05:57] <%MegboyManuel> reminds me of judge dredd, kinda
[2:05:59] <%Zamorouskiwhich> doodOne apatSmug
[2:06:00] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> I kind of prefer the legendary slug shotties for the ability to have mods
[2:06:09] <Deofiro> Yo PAT the Chaperone ornament gives it better range
[2:06:12] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat how easy is destiny to get into
[2:06:20] <DFireCreations> Gravemind was a pal
[2:06:20] <+PapermanXD> YES
[2:06:24] <%Saltmeisterr> no
[2:06:26] <%WackyGear> no
[2:06:27] <DFireCreations> no?
[2:06:27] <Marhunter7> how could we forget
[2:06:28] <%dekkitout> No, context pls?
[2:06:31] <%MegboyManuel> that was quite awhile ago
[2:06:33] <zamzoph> Was Plague talking about fucking dragons?
[2:06:34] <%Zamorouskiwhich> I think I do...
[2:06:36] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> there's too many arguments
[2:06:39] <%Neo_Kaiser> Is Plague a dragon?
[2:06:39] <Tucker0603> what's wrong with dragons?
[2:06:41] <NiktenKing> Legend of Dragoon argument?
[2:06:50] <%QueequegTheater> Oh jesus
[2:06:52] <+PapermanXD> He hates traditional dragons
[2:06:53] <NiktenKing> LEGEND OF DRAGOON
[2:06:54] <DFireCreations> oh YEAH
[2:06:56] <%TimetodiveLTX> hurr
[2:06:57] <soullesskin> Nothing is wrong with dragons
[2:07:04] <%dekkitout> Oh, dude- not dragon dragon are THE BEST!
[2:07:10] <%vectorless_peon> gragons are dumb exept if theyre not gragons
[2:07:12] <SGrim> Still?
[2:07:13] <%InugamiTheHound> Plague of gripes has a dragon fursona
[2:07:16] <%QueequegTheater> But Woolie liked KOTOR
[2:07:17] <dabeaminator> Is Indivisible bad? The gameplay looked interesting...
[2:07:18] <+jaytrident> sbfpMember sbfpMember sbfpMember
[2:07:19] <%GraceTBM> almond milk
[2:07:21] <SGrim> You're still on about this?
[2:07:28] <%QueequegTheater> @dabeaminator no, but it's not an RPG
[2:07:28] <+jaytrident> sbfpGreen sbfpGreen sbfpSOB sbfpSOB sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[2:07:29] <+PapermanXD> lizard with wings horns etc. is shitty to plague
[2:07:29] <NiktenKing> Okay... but are the dragons maids tho?
[2:07:32] <%GraceTBM> Indivisible seems good but not to pat's tastes
[2:07:33] <@SSaryn> WAH
[2:07:37] <IntrepidEye> Aren't a lot of monster hunter monsters some form of dragon?
[2:07:39] <%Neo_Kaiser> What I hate about dragons is how everybody wants to fight them so bad and you're given them at low levels.
[2:07:39] <%MegboyManuel> if I gave dragons human hands and feet, would he say that's a cool dragon
[2:07:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> Science Juice is gross
[2:07:45] <DFireCreations> hey the dragons in destiny are COOL
[2:07:48] <%GraceTBM> Wyverns intrepid
[2:07:51] <%Teintstein> pat using his eternal memory for evil
[2:07:53] <DFireCreations> destiny has GENIE DRAGONS
[2:07:56] <%Neo_Kaiser> Dragons should be scary and only fought at level 18-20, after preparing.
[2:07:57] <%purelyplum> When you load into match you can pop boons
[2:07:57] <Robert_Eccles> It's orange and it's juice so i see no problem
[2:07:57] <%MegboyManuel> nice nerd crown
[2:07:59] <soullesskin> Favorite soda? Go!
[2:08:02] <%QueequegTheater> Destiny has Shenrons
[2:08:06] <%LaughingCatt> Is Plague just a hipster's hipster?
[2:08:07] <%dekkitout> Literal eternal wish-dragons
[2:08:11] <%InugamiTheHound> mountain dew
[2:08:18] <%purelyplum> yee kind gift giver
[2:08:19] <Saiyza> "I hate Grim Reapers except the Reapers from Mass Effect"
[2:08:20] <%QueequegTheater> @DFireCreations You know I'm right, the ahamkara are Shenron
[2:08:28] <Marhunter7> @IntrepidEye the 3 "highest tier" monsters in monster hunter are just straight up dragons
[2:08:29] <%Neo_Kaiser> Dragons Dogma did is well, if you came across a Dragon before the end of the game you get your shit rocked.
[2:08:32] <%GraceTBM> Plague is a nihilistic hipster
[2:08:47] <%Zamorouskiwhich> LUL This team
[2:08:56] <%QueequegTheater> "My favorite dragon is Kirin"
[2:08:57] <dabeaminator> I learned not to take Plague's opinions too seriously when he hated Bloodborne.
[2:09:02] <%Neo_Kaiser> I wanna see Pat play Overwatch and get super toxic.
[2:09:05] <MasterDecoder> @IntrepidEye Most monsters(in World at least) are classified as some type of Wyvern, whether or not they are the typical type of Wyvern, except Elder Dragons, which includes a Unicorn
[2:09:09] <%Malisin_Murder> !uptime
[2:09:09] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 9m.
[2:09:10] <%vectorless_peon> most monstherhunter enemies are wyverns which are lesser dragons and not immortal demigods like the real elder dragons in that universe
[2:09:14] <%Keeble24> was that a double KO?
[2:09:21] <%Neo_Kaiser> I didn't really like BLoodborne. Probably for the same reason as Sekiro.
[2:09:23] <%CirnoIce> CirnoIce subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 19 month streak! well earlier today was my 18 month anniversary so i guess 5 hours is just a month now
[2:09:26] <Saiyza> Pat would get toxic in Overwatch because it's not optimizable.
[2:09:28] <Marhunter7> Fatalis in monster hunter is just a 100% typical western style black dragon
[2:09:31] <%GraceTBM> Don't wyverns have two legs and two wings and dragons have 4 legs
[2:09:32] <DFireCreations> @queequegtheater you are 100% right but as someone who doesnt watch db my ape brain didnt make that connection till now
[2:09:43] <soullesskin> Oh no pat is about to get mercy
[2:09:44] <Marhunter7> and he is the best
[2:09:46] <%QueequegTheater> @DFireCreations LUL
[2:09:57] <MasterDecoder> @GraceTBM Yes
[2:10:02] <Deofiro> @marhunter7 AROUND
[2:10:04] <%QueequegTheater> HA
[2:10:06] <%QueequegTheater> F
[2:10:09] <%LiquidShake83> ooo
[2:10:11] <%Keeble24> @AngriestPat i know it might not be your thing, but you gonna do any spooky games this month?
[2:10:12] <%InugamiTheHound> xcalF
[2:10:12] <Marhunter7> @Deofiro nothing ever going to bring him down
[2:10:14] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> dam son
[2:10:20] <Saiyza> GOD RAT
[2:10:39] <%Neo_Kaiser> Pat! Get toxic!
[2:10:47] <%QueequegTheater> Pat have a gamer moment
[2:10:49] <%cvp5127> pat used toxic
[2:10:50] <%Neo_Kaiser> Toxicier!
[2:10:51] <dabeaminator> Your melee in this seems super good...
[2:11:07] <%Neo_Kaiser> Maybe Pat just needs some GAMER FUEL!
[2:11:13] <%QueequegTheater> @dabeaminator Warlocks have the best melee
[2:11:16] <%LiquidShake83> wipe the toxic off your controller
[2:11:33] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> I wish my iron banner games had this level of sweat
[2:11:45] <%Neo_Kaiser> Pat is drooling in toxic.
[2:11:46] <Marhunter7> @dabeaminator fun fact, warlocks in destiny have the slowest melee in the game and it recovers noticeably slow than a hunter or titan's melee animation
[2:11:57] <%LiquidShake83> wow
[2:12:03] <%QueequegTheater> Do Hunters still have that absolutely fucking busted throwing knife ability where headshots gave them a free extra knife?
[2:12:15] <%dekkitout> Warlocks' melee speed make he hate Winter's Guile...
[2:12:16] <$realm_forge> You dun got Last Worded
[2:12:16] <Marhunter7> @QueequegTheater one sub class does yes
[2:12:20] <+D00msDayDan> @QueequegTheater they do, but thorowing knife can't oneshot
[2:12:28] <+Pyroclase> Warlocks used to have longer range but slower melee. They no longer have the range, but still have the slower speed.
[2:12:32] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> yeah, but something is really messed up with the headshot detection on other guardians specifically on pc, so it's not that busted
[2:12:32] <%Neo_Kaiser> Wasn't it a free knife throw upon a kill with it?
[2:12:53] <%QueequegTheater> @Neo_Kaiser Yeah and in D1 a headshot in Crucible was a OHKO
[2:12:56] <+D00msDayDan> way of the sharpshooter's throwing knife refreshes itself on headshot kill, but it can't oneshot headshot in crucible in d2
[2:13:02] <%Neo_Kaiser> Pat needs to be wearing a Razer headset.
[2:13:04] <%dekkitout> @QueequegTheater Yes, and their roll lets them refresh/reload across the hunter class Kappa
[2:13:10] <%Zamorouskiwhich> PogChamp They might actually come back
[2:13:13] <+sinistersally> @Neo_Kaiser needs to be a crit knife throw
[2:13:21] <Marhunter7> @Pyroclase its so weird, the damage comes out the same speed down to the frame for every class, but warlocks have much slower recovery frames so they can't follow up near as fast
[2:13:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> the beacons are lit! GONDOR CALLS FOR AID!!
[2:13:50] <seniormeatbox> pat when are you going to play Escape from Butcher Bay
[2:13:54] <%Neo_Kaiser> Call in your Titan Pat!
[2:14:00] <%Keeble24> YIKES
[2:14:02] <%dekkitout> Titan player is Titan...
[2:14:06] <+sinistersally> shotgun savenger doesnt' work in pvp... does it?
[2:14:07] <+DismalDavid> yes. punch the electric man.
[2:14:11] <%GraceTBM> I would love to see escape from butcher bay
[2:14:17] <dabeaminator> If I join PVP as a new player will I just be destroyed by people with high level gear, or will I be matched with other players of my "soul level"?
[2:14:21] <%QueequegTheater> Scrubquotes
[2:14:29] <Marhunter7> @sinistersally it does, but its like, 1 ammo per 2 bricks or something
[2:14:33] <Deofiro> @sinistersally gives you one .ore round per brick
[2:14:33] <seniormeatbox> Pat butcher bay when
[2:14:34] <%QueequegTheater> @dabeaminator only Iron Banner enables level advantages
[2:14:44] <NiktenKing> There is no level advantage unless it's Iron Banner
[2:14:51] <%dekkitout> @dabeaminator Depends on where you play, there's skill matchmaking and connection matchmaking
[2:14:54] <+sinistersally> @Marhunter7 ah
[2:14:57] <MasterDecoder> @dabeaminator Only if in Iron Banner
[2:14:57] <$Mighty_observer> buuuuuuuuuull shit
[2:14:58] <%Aeoneth> @dabeaminator Normal crucioble will normalize power, but lack of certain perks will hurt. Iron Banner will give you problems
[2:15:03] <+DingusMcFadden> I thought Pat no likely Destiny
[2:15:07] <%LiquidShake83> lol
[2:15:12] <%QueequegTheater> @DingusMcFadden that was like months ago
[2:15:16] <KingsVisage> @AngriestPat They announced in today's TWAB that they're nerfing the energy and health regen of Striker Titan's super.
[2:15:18] <Marhunter7> @sinistersally its not really worth it anymore, they nerfed it quite a bit during that lord of wolves debacle
[2:15:32] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> I'm honestly considering infusing up some Y2 armour with their scavenger rolls until I can get new ones @angriestpat
[2:15:36] <+DingusMcFadden> What happened, @QueequegTheater ?
[2:15:37] <%Neo_Kaiser> Pat needs to be louder, angrier, and have access to a time machine
[2:15:40] <%LiquidShake83> no!!!
[2:15:43] <+MusouMiko> angry pat vs the god rad
[2:15:49] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Its really weird, I have been hating D2 pvp... until Iron Banner. And I am usually under their light, but I am enjoying it more ._.
[2:15:51] <%QueequegTheater> @DingusMcFadden He played it instead of just saying it sucked
[2:15:52] <+D00msDayDan> it really miffs me that people call it striker titan and not just striker
[2:15:52] <NiktenKing> God Rat Got Pat
[2:15:53] <+DismalDavid> shadowkeep brought me back after a year of not playing. im very much enjoying it now.
[2:15:53] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[2:16:01] <Marhunter7> @AngriestPat the best part is they've already nerfed it... and its STILL that nuts
[2:16:04] <+D00msDayDan> imagine saying Bottom Tree Arc Striker Titan instead of just juggernaut
[2:16:12] <%dekkitout> Hopefully the nerf isn't too heavy handed like with Nova Warp- Hunter main btw SeriousSloth
[2:16:24] <seniormeatbox> @angriestpat are you ever going to play Escape from Butcher Bay?
[2:16:32] <+DingusMcFadden> @QueequegTheater I dunno... that doesn't sound like Pat
[2:16:34] <+sinistersally> @Marhunter7 guess not never really notice it while i was using it
[2:16:37] <Tucker0603> night man
[2:16:40] <%Keeble24> YEEEEE FF7
[2:16:42] <%QueequegTheater> @DingusMcFadden HMMM
[2:16:44] <+Pyroclase> Thank you for the stream, Pat!
[2:16:46] <%vixenpunch> Is escalation protocol on mars worth it, anything significant for completing all 7?
[2:16:46] <%Neo_Kaiser> You can't end a stream on a loss?
[2:16:47] <DSD24> Thanks for streaming Pat!
[2:16:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> Night fucko.
[2:16:51] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Night Pat!
[2:16:51] <zamzoph> inb4 FF7 cancelled
[2:16:52] <%purelyplum> You did awesome tonight
[2:16:53] <NiktenKing> Good, I like seeing you stomp people
[2:16:53] <QueequegTheater> "We have looked at Chaperone's balance, and in response we have nerfed fusion rifles again"
