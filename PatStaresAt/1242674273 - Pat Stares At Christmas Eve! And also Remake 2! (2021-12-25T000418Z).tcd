[0:37:42] <sirtommygunn> You can track covid cases by the number of negative Yankee Candle reviews
[0:37:42] <%Nope80808> Wine is concentrated farts tho.

[0:38:00] <%MelfinaStarwind> savory drinks are rad
[0:38:00] <%AgniBrandt> Wine's like coffee; enjoying it is a skill
[0:38:02] <%RayReborne> i have yet to try my local Ontario Wine i got

[1:00:00] <%RayReborne> The Crimmus
[1:00:02] <%scaryboisupreme> the WAR ON CHRISTMAS is so real, each year we gays try to kill it but we just make it more festive by accident!
[1:00:06] <+ThomasOfTroy> The gays attacking christmas isn't a thing in the US I think
[1:00:07] <%SwdVengeance> What did Thoradin Ex have against Santa?
[1:00:08] <Treasure_Vault> Fear is easy to sell.
[1:00:08] <+Fetrigon> Pat was born by the gays. confirmed.
[1:00:12] <linSP> the gays won again
[1:00:12] <CatRidder> christmas was kill by couch candy
[1:00:12] <+D00msDayDan> the war on christmas is just fox news riling up right wing christians
[1:00:12] <Qsmash_> The US looooves war
[1:00:14] <%Nordguy> no no no, the gays are trying to denolish tue Nuclear Family, pat.
[1:00:14] <%Cynical2DD> How dare we celebrate Christmas
[1:00:15] <Ipsenscastle> every year the gays blow up christmas with a rocket launcher as per tradition
[1:00:15] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> da war on crimbus

[1:00:23] <%pokefan9956> Christian here. the war on Christmas is fucking weird
[1:00:24] <+Mrbaconator> it's just republicans that get offended at the drop of a hat
[1:00:25] <%cooldude69xx> The gays actually like ugly sweaters, so thats something the two groups should bond over
[1:00:26] <chhdez> Americans gotta find an enemy somewhere, Pat
[1:00:26] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> We'll also forget that Christmas is a pagan holiday.
[1:00:27] <%Cynical2DD> Get out the 9 tail whips

[1:00:30] <scht3v3> Which agenda was to kill god? Because can we retroactively make that the goal for chrimbus?
[1:00:31] <+polothegreatest> They even blame younger generations

[1:00:54] <%GabeSweetMan> Sky Cake only tastes good if nobody gets to have their Sky Cookies or Sky Pies.
[1:00:56] <%JohnAtDawn> That's because it doesn't exist. It's culture war bullshit made up by conservatives because they know they can't just say "we want poor people and minorities to suffer"
[1:01:11] <TOONFOOD> it's historically known as the gay war
[1:01:11] <%Cynical2DD> @tigerstyle96 Hes a fraud

[1:05:00] <%Cynical2DD> @suitswonderland 2k pc wont play RE2? Try buying a pre built from Amazon, that seems to work for me
[1:05:03] <Ipsenscastle> all wine is just vinegar and nobody wants to admit it

[1:05:13] <%dekkitout> Which is why I highly advocate $40 worth of box wine
[1:05:13] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> I agree, and I drink a fair bit of wine
[1:05:14] <%KnifeyMcEdge> Do you taste the forest floor?
[1:05:14] <+Systolique> Maybe it's because of the Bad Canadian Red Wine?
[1:05:16] <%FunkyStreams> varying levels of sweetness.
[1:05:18] <Officialchourico> I fuck with white wine but red wine is wack
[1:05:19] <hearingthenseeing> Gasoline drink
[1:05:21] <+WhatTheFlox> red wine trash, mtn dew code red is where the taste is at
[1:05:24] <%KetsuoTaberu> It's hard for me to notice differences in taste unless I have like 5 different things in front of me
[1:05:25] <%SUITsWonderland> so any other taste is just so hard to enjoy because of the thing s that such taste
[1:05:25] <simplyvince15> I just go for Moscato personally

[1:05:53] <$realm_forge> Red wine is decent to cook with but I never liked it as a drink
[1:05:57] <CrypticMochi> Mostly just about scent and sweetness

[1:13:36] <2Bs_USB_port> WRONG
[1:13:43] <%dekkitout> One foot/glove? Why it gotta be like that?
[1:13:46] <%Nekros4442> Rydia gear looks great though
[1:13:47] <%GIGA255> it releases a chemical that softens the skull to allow for brain expansion/swelling from occupancy wuthout outright killing the victim
[1:13:50] <%AgniBrandt> That's unfortunate
[1:13:50] <%DianaTheAscian> I think it looks nice

[1:25:50] <%Treuan> It's kind of fucked
[1:25:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this poor guy though
[1:25:52] <lKaleidoscopel> have u met her
[1:25:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> AND ITS BEEN GOING FOR 60+ YEARS
[1:25:53] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Probably comes from the 1950s where you were expected to get married whether you wanted to or not.
[1:25:54] <@CreepyPorpoise> You only live once smh
[1:25:55] <%linSP> wife bad, life bad, dont ride wife
[1:25:55] <+BlooBirdo> american boomer humor is maximum cringe
[1:25:56] <Ravioli_Ronin> That‚Äôs exclusively boomers
[1:25:57] <McGrits> American boomer humor is "wife bad, kids, bad, and technology bad"
[1:25:57] <zanzibarian_hamster> It's a wasp thing
[1:26:00] <%TungstenViper> not as memorable tbh
[1:26:01] <%Maids4lyfe> Because marriage is bad and we can't let gays have it
[1:26:06] <%cooldude69xx> Pat already shit talks paige on the daily
[1:26:07] <+wolfe_leon> that's why columbo good, columbo love his wife
[1:26:09] <%CatastropheCorvid> Why not?
[1:26:10] <hereiam407> Still looks good
[1:26:11] <%sick_kickflips> plus the lines aren't nearly as cheesy
[1:26:12] <%TungstenViper> the original as banger catchphrases
[1:26:13] <%dasmause> weird culture that opresses LGBT community but hates their hetero marriages
[1:26:16] <+moranprime> All you need to memorize is Leon going "What the heck are you?!" while staring at a zombie every time
[1:26:17] <%Cynical2DD> Cause youre an adult and you have other games to play
[1:26:17] <nomolomo> this one is also longer
[1:26:19] <+zsDirtyHarry> Why'd she bite me
[1:26:19] <+b_bang_> bald
[1:26:21] <%Talhee> THAT GUYS A MANIAC, WHYD HE BITE ME?!
[1:26:23] <%Deft_Thought> What's bizarre about conflating your dissatisfaction with your life with a person you spend an incredible amount of time with
[1:26:24] <%StebTheVee> he's bald
[1:26:24] <eustine> Just drive off buddy.
[1:26:26] <Omenaire_> LOOK OUT TRUCK GUY
[1:26:27] <BinaryBetrayer> Zombie stands up with all those bones broken
[1:26:28] <%MidnightBurst12> D:
[1:26:29] <+condemned_15> why'd he bite meh?!
[1:26:30] <willyfreshness> he'll never finish that burger now
[1:26:30] <Ipsenscastle> The gays are out to ruin my horrible marriage
[1:26:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @maids4lyfe We're trying to save them LUL
[1:26:34] <+moranprime> Zombambo attacc
[1:26:34] <Meltgar> Skeleton warriors
[1:26:35] <zanzibarian_hamster> BALD
[1:26:36] <%Deft_Thought> Leon loves BUTTROCK
[1:26:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> nice tunes bro
[1:26:40] <+KiwiRedgrave> Is that DANTE?
[1:26:43] <+BirdcakeMN> Leon listens to buttrock
[1:26:44] <cybz99> I did not please rewind it
[1:26:44] <$raziel391> and the best phrase is not in it
[1:26:46] <mike2hands> Buttrock
[1:26:46] <+wolfe_leon> the dialogue also isn't as cheesy and memorable in remake
[1:26:47] <StoicMoogle> There's our favorite Joestar
[1:26:50] <BinaryBetrayer> Butt Rock
[1:26:50] <%TungstenViper> He's gonna RAM US
[1:26:51] <Ell1ot> Barry! look out, it's a monster!
[1:26:52] <+mastertwin2> of course leon drives a wrangler
[1:26:52] <%cooldude69xx> @Deft_Thought No considering why, only complaining about the olds
[1:26:54] <willyfreshness> He would be a Jeep guy
[1:26:54] <Ravioli_Ronin> Leon fucking loves pearl jam
[1:26:56] <%Cactuskris> more games should rent this engine it looks so good
[1:26:59] <$raziel391> "and to think that taxidermy was my hobbie"
[1:27:02] <Ipsenscastle> Dante Leonfield
[1:27:04] <Tracazoid> Technically yes
[1:27:04] <%CatastropheCorvid> Pat , did you also watch the new Jim gaffagan comedy special?
[1:27:05] <Laecerelius> Oh man should've had some DMC music going on in his car
[1:27:08] <%GIGA255> Leon Nixon
[1:27:10] <%Cynical2DD> For a dead woman who was smashed by a truck she didnt look dead nor was she smashed with a truck
[1:27:10] <+zsDirtyHarry> This party's getting crazy *Hits record player*
[1:27:12] <%cooldude69xx> What radio stations would Dante like?
[1:27:14] <%FunkyStreams> why'd he grab the diesel pump?
[1:27:15] <Ell1ot> Where is everyone? Bingo?
[1:27:16] <+azraith> Leon is everyone's shitty hockey nephew grown up
[1:27:17] <Meltgar> Don Tea
[1:27:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @catastrophecorvid That shit was hilarious
[1:27:25] <%FunkyStreams> leon you're going to cease your cars engine!
[1:27:26] <%XzileGaming> tha isnt weird, your pants are weird
[1:27:26] <%TungstenViper> soooooo much better
[1:27:26] <+moranprime> I like how Leon goes to put a gas pump in from a closed looking gas station lol
[1:27:28] <+zsDirtyHarry> That is a correct opinion Pat
[1:27:28] <$realm_forge> That‚Äôs weird
[1:27:29] <%MidnightBurst12> Dante lost some weight
[1:27:29] <Omenaire_> it kinda is better
[1:27:32] <Laecerelius> Didn't even notice until you mentioned it
[1:27:33] <%jinking79> Leon after a hangover  cry over getting dump by his girlfriend
[1:27:34] <%Deft_Thought> The new boss music is pretty great
[1:27:38] <willyfreshness> HAMBURGERS
[1:27:39] <+healnavi> the new soundtrack is barely audible
[1:27:41] <+superchronicc> for nostalgia reasons
[1:27:42] <Ravioli_Ronin> Oh shit I didn‚Äôt even know that‚Äôs an option
[1:27:45] <Omenaire_> classic sound effects are better too
[1:27:46] <nomolomo> did you think the new one was bad tho? or just not as good?
[1:27:47] <Danitaras> PC or console?
[1:27:48] <+Excel83> I watched the new movie and i recited the whole opening FMV while watching when STARS are flying around the forest zone, situated in north west racoon city, where they were searching for the their compatriots, barvo team
[1:27:48] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Do you like Leon's default costume or his classic?
[1:27:55] <Laecerelius> THey puttin' drugs int he ice cream!
[1:27:56] <%TungstenViper> the new ost is kinda lame except for Mr.X theme
[1:27:56] <%MidnightBurst12> alright grandpa
[1:27:58] <%SaphronBlackbourne> it is, and I love the old menu beep boops
[1:27:58] <Aydarkzero> yeah but can we put the remake music for the final escape cause it's rad
[1:27:59] <McGrits> I don't know. I think the classic ost, although great, feels out of place in the remake
[1:28:00] <SaltyAzteca> Yes that's a yes. original is better
[1:28:00] <SomeStrangeBroad> i had a friend over, a real one, not a made up friend
[1:28:02] <DrkJP520> At least the improved the music in 3make
[1:28:03] <%Nope80808> WTF would herb ice cream even taste like?
[1:28:11] <Meltgar> 458 DOLLARS?! wtf
[1:28:13] <aflowerybard> Hey, y‚Äôall know how e-girls want to be called iLadies now?
[1:28:20] <+Excel83> Classic sound track is THE shit
[1:28:28] <Omenaire_> well they probably wanted to modernize it
[1:28:30] <ThatGuyThere03> @aflowerybard that sounds fake
[1:28:33] <%GIGA255> @aflowerybard no
[1:28:33] <%superc37> MAN IS WISH DEMONS SOULS HAD THAT OPTION
[1:28:34] <%BigCoffee> Is the classic soudntrack a paid dlc?
[1:28:37] <%FunkyStreams> 'Damn meth head, aagain'
[1:28:39] <+moranprime> The only song I even know from the soundtrack is just the Lab Escape and Super Tyrant fight theme.
[1:28:40] <%TungstenViper> like, it fits so much better for every context
[1:28:41] <cartakus> Well that is a job well done huh...
[1:28:42] <dullvivid> i love leon's new escape sequence theme with the tyrant's boss mix
[1:28:43] <+healnavi> it feels like the new OST was created after the fact
[1:28:44] <%BigCoffee> @superc37 ikr
[1:28:46] <Ell1ot> can you switch in original character models?
[1:28:51] <%kujofire990> yummy
[1:28:52] <zanzibarian_hamster> Florida man on the loose again
[1:28:54] <+moranprime> Also HUNK and Kendo's DLC music tracks were pretty cool

[1:29:02] <%dekkitout> Would it be rude for Leon to swipe a donut from the front
[1:29:05] <nomolomo> man the gore in this game is so fucking good
[1:29:06] <+Excel83> its SOOOOO much better
[1:29:07] <%RayReborne> BUM

[1:29:38] <$realm_forge> Zombies are nothing Zangeif is the true threat
[1:29:41] <@CreepyPorpoise> This is such a good game
[1:29:46] <+Excel83> the new OST is fine, but its got nothing on the original
[1:29:50] <Laecerelius> Pat y u no schuuut?!

[1:29:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Shhhhhh
[1:29:55] <Make_me_mad> Still super glad about the RE2 and RE3 remakes. I can't believe it took this long for someone to make an actually playable version of these games.
[1:29:55] <chhdez> Because it is!
[1:29:58] <Ipsenscastle> oh man jeez oh no
[1:29:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL LUL

[1:30:08] <Omenaire_> gotta be ready for anything on the force
[1:30:09] <%TungstenViper> like, listen to this
[1:30:10] <+Havictos> Where did all these zombies actually come from?
[1:30:11] <%Nope80808> @MidnightBurst12 That sounds horrific. Maybe not the grape kind.
[1:30:12] <aflowerybard> That‚Äôs all I had to say, have a good Christmas everyone!
[1:30:12] <+buttdirt> he's emiting big dick energy
[1:30:13] <%GIGA255> did leon have a cleft chin in RE4?

[1:30:17] <DrkJP520> Why no low poly models?
[1:30:17] <%Agami23> i see pat is using the full diaper mod from the nexus
[1:30:25] <%cooldude69xx> @Havictos The Drama Dimension
[1:30:26] <$BoneWheelSkeleton> Resident Evil is all about playing the video-game as little as possible.
[1:30:31] <nomolomo> nothings braver than being a coward
[1:30:31] <%Wulfphelz> the diaper helps for situations like this
[1:30:31] <%Visorak6> Didnt he just ditch HIS vehicle there?
[1:30:41] <TheGarfieldKart> Happy smismas Pat
[1:30:42] <%StebTheVee> Last places you should go in a zombie apacalypse are police stations and hospitals
[1:30:49] <spencer_zero> Why you playing the RE2 remake?
[1:31:00] <%Officialchourico> The only thing I don't like about this game is their hair
[1:31:05] <+mastertwin2> zangief is making zombie noises its tripping me out
[1:31:05] <DSD24> I love this intro
[1:31:06] <%Monkeyweed21> "Hey Leon do you own a cat? I've always wanted to own some cats"
[1:31:07] <%Deft_Thought> Oh no, there's a zombie in the hous--nevermind, just Gief psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:31:10] <SulfurousAcid> it's a good game
[1:31:10] <%Officialchourico> the hair moves like they are underwater or sum shit

[1:31:20] <StoicMoogle> Oh look they even modeled the potholes
[1:31:22] <%watts121> I still come back to this game from time to time. It's a very relaxing game strangely.
[1:31:23] <SomeStrangeBroad> not
[1:31:25] <+healnavi> yes
[1:31:26] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Why nit the OG game? Is this much better?

[1:31:27] <@CreepyPorpoise> Christmas fight? Christmas fight.

[1:31:40] <%valcheese> RE2 the BEST
[1:31:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Think you can speedrun the whole thing? @patstaresat
[1:31:42] <%SUITsWonderland> this is like so correct for Pat
[1:31:43] <%dekkitout> No items, body hits only
[1:31:44] <$BoneWheelSkeleton> Why are you streaming, streamer? Kinda cringe, tbh.
[1:31:46] <carrion_king_> Is it some kind of dystopian corporate america thing to have an ad for Umbrella on the Welcome sign to raccoon city?
[1:31:46] <SomeStrangeBroad> christmas brawl

[1:31:52] <@CreepyPorpoise> If the whole chat fought him, it'd be like one big group hug uwu
[1:31:53] <Treasure_Vault> And 1998 had no christmas
[1:31:54] <%Nope80808> Close enough.
[1:31:54] <mr_saturday93> Refresh my memory but is Jill currently unconscious in the hospital rn?
[1:31:54] <%sniffy77> Was it this game or re3makenthat came out at the beginning of covid

[1:31:54] <$realm_forge> I‚Äôll fight you pat and I‚Äôll totally take the fall so you look cool
[1:31:55] <TurtlesAndTentacles> close enough
[1:31:55] <tanarath> Pat really likes RE2 & the remake especially, for those who don't know.
[1:31:56] <Make_me_mad> @TurtlesAndTentacles I mean the OG game is an ancient trash pile vaguely shaped into a game, so yes.
[1:32:00] <%Visorak6> It wouldve been on the nose to play bayonetta
[1:32:01] <$Emperor_Machinus> Right on Christmas
[1:32:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Close Enough
[1:32:02] <%Nekros4442> I'm sure you can mod in some x-masy stuff
[1:32:03] <nomolomo> you know what is a christmas game tho? shattered memories
[1:32:07] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt I know you've talked about this but I can't remember but isn't the whole city under quarantine how do they just drive in?
[1:32:10] <aveyya2478> fuck that Guy, Pat , I could care less if you played Twisted metal , and I'd still watch @patstaresat

[1:32:27] <%twistedj3ster> Mr. X-Mas
[1:32:31] <%SUITsWonderland> I have been watching this dude since his RE2 Orig LP on TBFP channel so like such a long time ago man, its been such a journey
[1:32:37] <+mastertwin2> Yakuza is a great christmas game
[1:32:40] <Make_me_mad> @TungstenViper Any Resident Evil before 4 is unplayable.

[1:32:49] <+BlooBirdo> at least 2
[1:32:52] <Tophattington> Zangief could speedrun the game!
[1:32:56] <+cdrom321> How do you feel about the randomized Mr. X?
[1:32:57] <OmniSTylez> possibly even 8
[1:32:58] <%watts121> @mastertwin2 yeah if you wanna cry
[1:32:58] <%Talhee> Maybe even one of them is a Hunk.
[1:33:02] <+Excel83> This game and the original are so infinitely replayable
[1:33:04] <%XzileGaming> @Make_me_mad hot take
[1:33:06] <%SUITsWonderland> I know far too much about Pat than I know about other people I should know stuff about

[1:33:09] <spencer_zero> Eight if you include Mr. X
[1:33:10] <%SUITsWonderland> like family

[1:33:56] <+bugz_munny> He couldnt
[1:33:58] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Why couldn't he go forward again?
[1:33:58] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Because he'd back into the truck....
[1:33:59] <%FunkyStreams> ,uh burgers

[1:34:05] <+Excel83> WHY'D HE BITE ME!?!
[1:34:06] <%cooldude69xx> They could have put zombies on the back of the car, but o
[1:34:06] <Profmcstevie> what a.....rookie mistake
[1:34:07] <%Talhee> I dont understand why he couldnt move it like a foot forward there was room to spare.
[1:34:08] <%superc37> himbo
[1:34:10] <nomolomo> dont worry about it
[1:34:13] <+Havictos> you'd be dead from that
[1:34:14] <%GIGA255> maybe he was using reverse psychology on the car
[1:34:15] <+moranprime> And Claire is super dead
[1:34:16] <%Who_lio42> cars dont go backwards pat
[1:34:16] <Brandon__Brando> because  explosion

[1:36:52] <@SSaryn> Run Interlaced, go as low as you can go and FUCKING KNIFE AWAY
[1:36:55] <+cdrom321> One of the most important rules of modern game development: Never base ANYTHING on frames. Base instead on delta time between game cycles.
[1:36:57] <Brandon__Brando> pay to win speedrun
[1:36:57] <+extradopeness> oh it is literally damage?
[1:36:58] <Profmcstevie> Knife does damage per frame, more FPS means more frames in contact
[1:37:00] <%TungstenViper> uncapped fps makes the knife do like 10X damage
[1:37:01] <nomolomo> love this track
[1:37:02] <%antares_000> that ost tho
[1:37:02] <%SUITsWonderland> safe stuff made illegal so crazy stuff get made which are super bad and even lots of illegal and legal stuff are too toxic when they can be far better
[1:37:04] <willyfreshness> What the fuck is Boxing Day tho?
[1:37:05] <%Agami23> cant go wrong with the matilda
[1:37:08] <devanmuse> Use the samurai edge, you coward

[1:38:50] <@SSaryn> Now he'll never get under 3 hours
[1:38:53] <%dekkitout> Wait, hold on he can salvage the run
[1:38:53] <%Agami23> there are weirdly alot of christmas mods in re2make

[1:39:10] <+cascadepersona> S Rank stream, inbound
[1:39:13] <%SUITsWonderland> people seem too think cheating is easy but cheating at good things and well is a skill
[1:39:14] <+Excel83> Good job remembering that. I use a cheat sheet
[1:39:15] <@CreepyPorpoise> this man's mind
[1:39:15] <%blue_warzone> Why
[1:39:24] <%SUITsWonderland> like cheating at University is a skill

[1:51:26] <+CrimKangaroo> oh Marvin, you poor, beautiful, bastard
[1:51:30] <CasualHardcoreTheater> Alright hand shakes over, where‚Äôs the hand sanitizer lol
[1:51:31] <DracaenaLeaf> :(
[1:51:39] <%Agami23> i like that leon doesent just go "why is there a secret passage in the police station?"
[1:51:42] <rotacon> DUDE I THOUGHT A ZOMBIE NOISE WAS GLITCHING OUT
[1:51:42] <+Soliloquy123> Something about the line "they told me to stay the fuck away, I wish I'd come here sooner" is just great
[1:51:51] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt So why did Bioweapons become such a huge thing even though they fail over and over?
[1:51:55] <%Zero_Jacks> lytCRYA lytWAH
[1:52:00] <%Officialchourico> playing P3 for the first time and the fact that dying sends me back to the menu screen makes me want to give up forever
[1:52:12] <anAngryHamster> Fuckin Brad
[1:52:16] <SaltyAzteca> Marv deserved better
[1:52:21] <Aydarkzero> you got a knife
[1:52:25] <StoicMoogle> Ahh that's so true! Why DOESNT Leon ask "Why is there a secret passage?"
[1:52:28] <+Havictos> why not just make like laser weapons and shit
[1:52:30] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> God I love that "You do not hesitate" line. perfect delivery
[1:52:33] <%cooldude69xx> @Havictos Bioweapons are like GaaS games. If you get lucky with a good one, it'll be super cool
[1:52:36] <nomolomo> knoife
[1:52:39] <justachap> character animations so good
[1:52:42] <+CrimKangaroo> that's not a knife!
[1:52:47] <%AgniBrandt> Marv would be fine if Leon would just use one of his magical first-aid sprays on him
[1:52:49] <Aydarkzero> it's the resident evil universe
[1:52:51] <+Soliloquy123> It's the RE7 yellow tape!
[1:52:56] <%MelBrooksKA> @officialchourico i abused save states like hell
[1:52:56] <Treasure_Vault> Leon understands the importance of secret passages everywhere.
[1:53:01] <%Agami23> it feels almost like leon shouldent be surprised. like the entire world is as wacky as this police station
[1:53:11] <Treasure_Vault> Every building has a fire escape passage
[1:53:15] <Aydarkzero> @AgniBrandt nah happened in a cutscene so you need cutscene healing
[1:53:22] <%TungstenViper> leon just goes along the shitfuckery at this point
[1:53:23] <%castlerock42> I'm still stuck on the RPD having knives as a standard.
[1:53:26] <CasualHardcoreTheater> Could be worse, Marc was 3 days from retirement
[1:53:27] <Laecerelius> Time to pick up stuff we're never gonna use!
[1:53:36] <+Excel83> God I love the OG OST
[1:53:45] <%Officialchourico> @melbrookska playing on a ps2 so kinda fucked in that regard :/
[1:53:50] <devanmuse> What I never got was: why didn't Umbrella just sell the imperfect T-virus as a bioweapon instead of trying to make Tyrants? One drop of T-virus in the water supply could wipe out a whole population.
[1:53:55] <DSD24> Colt Butters
[1:53:59] <+victhebeard> maybe in Racoon city USA Japan. secret passages are more common.
[1:54:01] <+Havictos> @Agami23 Isn't all the nonsensical puzzle based architecture all because of one guy whose name escapes me?
[1:54:09] <kitestar> Oh look it‚Äôs 2make
[1:54:10] <rotacon> Vending Machine Zombie!
[1:54:10] <RexSurname> Its the only way to play RE games lol
[1:54:15] <rotacon> love that guy
[1:54:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> strong maybe
[1:54:29] <ComfyFox> "noooo my new pants"
[1:54:31] <epyonics> lmao
[1:54:32] <%TungstenViper> @devanmuse cause their CEOs are fucking lunatics
[1:54:34] <+Excel83> Stoooop he's already dead"
[1:54:35] <SaltyAzteca> Yeyeye SLICIN AND DICIN
[1:54:38] <%studleydoorite> remember in RE6 when you heroically work to open a similar secret passage in the church, then a monster comes out of it and horrifically kills everyone?  what an iconic gaming moment
[1:54:40] <Tracazoid> He might need an extra poke for good measure
[1:54:42] <zanzibarian_hamster> re4ing it
[1:54:43] <KaironFortressKnight> Blargh
[1:54:44] <SaltyAzteca> WEAPON OF CHOICE
[1:54:48] <Ell1ot> just like in re4
[1:54:49] <%cooldude69xx> @devanmuse As is, it could probably backfire super hard. Luckily umbrella would never make a mistake like that
[1:54:49] <kitestar> 2make‚Äôs a good game‚Ä¶unlike 3make
[1:54:50] <rotacon> his 20,000¬• pants
[1:54:59] <%XelanArdel> sound design in this game is great
[1:55:15] <kitestar> 3make is okay, but the budget went into resistance
[1:55:17] <+Excel83> NED MRG
[1:55:20] <%TungstenViper> NDA
[1:55:20] <%cooldude69xx> @kitestar Is 3make even bad, or just underwhelming as a follow-up to this?
[1:55:34] <%TungstenViper> Ned Flanders and Marge Simpson
[1:55:34] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:55:36] <kitestar> it‚Äôs just underwhelming
[1:55:38] <Namalus20> @patstaresat RE4 VR when?
[1:55:42] <Profmcstevie> 3make is missing things from 3, like the decision stuff and some areas
[1:55:47] <KaironFortressKnight> Gun better
[1:55:51] <zanzibarian_hamster> Is pat just being quiet?
[1:55:52] <rotacon> this part always makes me pause
[1:55:59] <zanzibarian_hamster> oh, yep
[1:55:59] <+Havictos> @cooldude69xx It's a great game it's a bad RE3 remake does that make any sense?
[1:56:06] <rotacon> like imagine you're Leon and you show up to work on your first day
[1:56:08] <kitestar> the budget just went into resistance, the multiplayer ‚Äúmode‚Äù that‚Äôs attached
[1:56:13] <Treasure_Vault> That dude glowed like he had dropped a live grenade on death or something.
[1:56:14] <+Excel83> Locker?
[1:56:17] <rotacon> "hey our welcome gift to you is a spare mag"
[1:56:21] <big_oki> lol double tap
[1:56:22] <Laecerelius> That's one tough zombo
[1:56:24] <rotacon> "for your service weapon"
[1:56:33] <rotacon> "we locked it in your desk"
[1:56:34] <Treasure_Vault> Ahh, the blood spray looks like a live grenade light
[1:56:38] <+Excel83> 2 and 3
[1:56:49] <%TungstenViper> @kitestar it's the fact that nemesis got nerfed to shit and Nikolai became an idiot. also the fact that Raccoon City is turned into corridor city
[1:57:13] <kitestar> the reverse is true for village that the budget went into the main game and the ‚Äúmode‚Äù is no where to be found
[1:57:15] <+samuraiskitz> This is easily one of the most solid remakes ever mad
[1:57:20] <+samuraiskitz> made*
[1:57:20] <kitestar> @tungstenviper you don‚Äôt say
[1:57:45] <kitestar> a lot of people blame resistance
[1:57:58] <KaironFortressKnight> Poor zombie, he was so close
[1:58:02] <whimwhisp> calmmm
[1:58:02] <Aydarkzero> ah safety
[1:58:03] <+Havictos> it's pretty good
[1:58:06] <%TungstenViper> @kitestar i mean, it still makes me angry. og RE3 is sooooo much better
[1:58:08] <%KnightOfTrousers> KnightOfTrousers subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Nice chill christmas eve with zombles, the way god intended
[1:58:10] <andrejuhhhh> this song is pure bliss
[1:58:18] <+Excel83> Speaking of reverse, that still hasn't come out. Has it been abandoned?
[1:58:24] <RexSurname> atpHorns atpHorns
[1:58:31] <SaltyAzteca> RE7s banjo is a mood though
[1:58:37] <kitestar> @excel83 it‚Äôs been dated for next year
[1:58:41] <eustine> Pat have you listened to Mono Memory? They make remixed RE music tracks.
[1:58:49] <kitestar> I forget when exactly
[1:59:05] <RexSurname> Nice - had good luck with those head shots!
[1:59:07] <DSD24> Wasn't ReVersus super jank
[1:59:09] <DrkJP520> Have you played the tofu modes?
[1:59:25] <Laecerelius> Her head asplode
[1:59:33] <RexSurname> CAP
[1:59:35] <mr_saturday93> I just remembered that RE3R explains the hole in the bathroom but not the wall on the 3rd flor
[1:59:36] <anAngryHamster> I can't believe a deaf man composed all this music. I thought he reached his peak with clowns farting in the basement
[1:59:40] <+Excel83> I miss REsistence. It was great, they just could never quite balance it
[1:59:47] <Kghaleon> I remember when Woolie straight up guessed the combo
[1:59:48] <RexSurname> the best unlock code ever in this game lol
[1:59:51] <Profmcstevie> Shout out to RE4 making it so head exploded means "MAYBE they're dead"
[2:00:00] <jaygee303> Is the audio mixing a bit off for anyone else?
[2:00:03] <%TungstenViper> still don't get why the other locker is DCM and not DMC
[2:00:06] <bedhouse> beep boop
[2:00:07] <nomolomo> anti speed running puzzleeee
[2:00:17] <%AnIcedCoffee> So what happened to Nioh
[2:00:17] <%TungstenViper> pepeD
[2:00:26] <Ranger747> LUL
[2:00:32] <+Soliloquy123> This goofy-ass simon says security system
[2:00:33] <rotacon> i love that stupid ass portable safe
[2:00:38] <rotacon> satisfying
[2:00:39] <+wolfe_leon> I downloaded a mod to remove them and just make them the part
[2:00:39] <andrejuhhhh> LMFAO
[2:00:39] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Beep beep boop
[2:00:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> sadge
[2:00:42] <+Havictos> ?
[2:00:43] <ComfyFox> nu-uh
[2:00:44] <PrinceOfEden> Ohhhhh, got em.
[2:00:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> gottem
[2:00:52] <%AnIcedCoffee> Did you get filtered LUL
[2:00:52] <+Excel83> @anAngryHamster He wasn't actually deaf, and he only composed the music for the DS Directors Cut of one.
[2:00:52] <mr_saturday93> @Excel83 REsistance is dead? wow
[2:00:54] <+Havictos> I thought you liked it?
[2:00:54] <kitestar> @dsd24 dunno I hadn‚Äôt played the beta, I think the reception for the beta was the reason why it got delayed‚Ä¶but stuff made it go much further back
[2:00:55] <Profmcstevie> The worst pokemon, Nooh
[2:00:56] <%MidnightBurst12> i don't get it
[2:00:56] <SaltyAzteca> you sure did nail it
[2:01:20] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt I recall reading that the Nioh team wants to do an open world if they ever get to do Nioh 3. Think that'd make it worth another look?
[2:01:21] <tanarath> Pat doesn't Luke the level or inventory systems in Nioh 2.
[2:01:32] <Profmcstevie> Pat liked Nioh 2, he didn't like how Nioh 2 makes itself harder to enjoy the best part
[2:01:34] <+Excel83> @mr_saturday93 Probably not totally dead, but I played that shit every day for 6 months, I miss it
[2:01:35] <rotacon> pee pee cat
[2:01:36] <tanarath> leveling *
[2:01:39] <DSD24> @kitestar I'd imagine COVID causing issues too
[2:01:52] <andrejuhhhh> the loot system in nioh is actual cancer
[2:01:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> pog
[2:01:55] <%TungstenViper> why not make a NEW fucking Ninja Gaiden?
[2:02:01] <%Agami23> final fantasy stranger in paradise might be neat since its nioh final fantasy
[2:02:04] <Laecerelius> Is FF Origins gonna be level based or open world?
[2:02:04] <Majin_Kuum> Niohpen world
[2:02:07] <%TungstenViper> like, JUST DO IT
[2:02:08] <+Havictos> @Profmcstevie Like what?
[2:02:08] <%Who_lio42> i thought they said they were done with Nioh games
[2:02:09] <DSD24> I like the missions personally, but I get why people don't like it
[2:02:12] <%AgniBrandt> Fingers crossed then! I'd fucking LOVE to see open world yokai bullshit
[2:02:12] <Treasure_Vault> Is there a Nioh 2 mod that replaces the diablo loot with not that?
[2:02:13] <%StebTheVee> They need to come up with better level designs as well
[2:02:13] <%notsoy> what is the best open world in video games and why is it kamurocho
[2:02:13] <kitestar> @dsd24 very likely
[2:02:17] <%Visorak6> thank you for making Diadem bearable tonight pat
[2:02:21] <KaironFortressKnight> Devil Cry May?
[2:02:21] <ComfyFox> Devil Cry Maybe
[2:02:22] <lloyddboy> DEVIL CRY MAY
[2:02:33] <%Persona_EX> Did he pick up the ammo on the ground from the cop lady?
[2:02:36] <+Orcapugs> What a weird hang up Pat. J
[2:02:40] <kitestar> may cry devil
[2:02:41] <%AgniBrandt> @Treasure_Vault Thank you for reminding me to see whether Nioh 2 has mods
[2:02:41] <%Who_lio42> or atleast that story/era
[2:02:43] <Profmcstevie> @Havictos Loot system, level design, RPG stuff,etc. He likes the combat and the game kept getting diverting from it
[2:03:00] <DXLelouch24> So you want a FromSoft x Team Ninja collab game?
[2:03:02] <kitestar> DEE EMM CEE 2 DONTE IS BAEST
[2:03:21] <+Orcapugs> Just beat A rivals return on Nioh 2 today. Thank god for that corner drop gimmick. If you know you know
[2:03:23] <SaltyAzteca> youre important Marvin
[2:03:31] <%TungstenViper> Tecmo know hot to do Action combat, they should focus on that
[2:04:02] <%KnightOfTrousers> Is this the same VA for Leon from original RE4 / RE4 Remake?
[2:04:10] <kitestar> I should get an actual copy of RE3 classic
[2:04:11] <%Maids4lyfe> no
[2:04:20] <%blue_warzone> Why did they tone down the gore so much in RE3 remake?
[2:04:20] <+Excel83> @KnightOfTrousers No, all new cast
[2:04:25] <kitestar> I don‚Äôt think it is
[2:04:31] <eustine> Isnt it more cost efficient to just kneecap and knife?
[2:04:33] <dimensaur> I thought the one that falls through was the one on the side not the middle
[2:04:39] <DSD24> Get down Mr President!
[2:04:44] <lloyddboy> took the bullet for gim
[2:04:48] <DSD24> That zombie did the other one a solid
[2:04:56] <+Excel83> He tanked that shot for him
[2:05:01] <krackman245> SeemsGood
[2:05:04] <+Soliloquy123> Yeah no fuck the library
[2:05:15] <zenith0111> Unlimited knife
[2:05:16] <Profmcstevie> Headshots are more fun though, zoombo go sploosh
[2:05:20] <andrejuhhhh> i fucking hate the library
[2:05:24] <Majin_Kuum> they still remaking 4?
[2:05:29] <sublimedeer> "get down Mr. President"
[2:05:32] <kitestar> checks the cost of 2make dlc
[2:05:42] <RedChrisfield> i saw a video talking about the gore getting toned down because of RE resistance, so RE3 suffered to
[2:05:46] <+Excel83> Pat, how many times have you actually played this? Seems like you really know your routing
[2:05:54] <gingemahminge1> Kappa
[2:06:00] <chernabogs_bane> 4 hours a way on my end, but merry christmas everyone
[2:06:02] <DSD24> Didn't someone already remake the textures in RE4?
[2:06:05] <kitestar> @majin_kuum as far as I know they are, but VR was the only thing to come from talks of it so far
[2:06:12] <whimwhisp> that's it~
[2:06:22] <+matf8> i've never played this game, seeing you fly through the puzzle is super confusing lmao
[2:06:24] <+BelricPsytar> @Excel83 Oh you must not know how much of a re fiend pat is
[2:06:27] <DrFacilier> whats your most replayed game next to Re2 Original?
[2:06:28] <+boomstarprime> o 9 times thats all
[2:06:29] <Rawbone_saw> so you've done it a billion times, gotcha
[2:06:33] <%baronblank> had to leave for a bit and was worried I'd miss some, but this is still before too much crazy
[2:06:34] <+RobertWayneLewis98> is this your favorite game of all time?
[2:06:35] <SaltyAzteca> just yknow. 8 or 50 times. NBD.
[2:06:40] <kitestar> they never said it was cancelled
[2:06:42] <Treasure_Vault> It's cool watching Pat demonstrate high level mastery at 15% battery level
[2:06:43] <+Excel83> I've played the original more times than I can count, I've played this maybe 12 times
[2:06:48] <%shurtal> Pat, no longer tight as fuck
[2:06:59] <willyfreshness> you just need some Viagra to boost the brain power
[2:07:03] <fuji_n2> pat u could play parasite eve for Christmas my dude OpieOP
[2:07:19] <+Excel83> @Excel83 Oh I know, I just didn't think he'd played this one so much
[2:07:49] <+RobertWayneLewis98> Everyone should have a christmas tradition video game
[2:07:52] <ECRead> It has been many moons since I've been able to catch a stream due to my new job. how're yall doin ?
[2:07:56] <Manipulator98> did you finish lost judgment? my goty
[2:07:57] <McGrits> Hey Pat, I'm sure you've been asked this before, but do you prefer 2 Remake or 2 original more?
[2:08:02] <lloyddboy> schlop schlop schlop
[2:08:03] <kitestar> a parasite eve playthrough would be boss
[2:08:05] <+matf8> After playing through it so many times do you still find new things or does the game still surprise you in any way?
[2:08:33] <willyfreshness> why is playing the Breath of the wild shrine music?
[2:08:44] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Would you ever go back to the original 2?
[2:08:48] <+Excel83> I think both are near perfect. They're on equal ground. Whereas 1 and REmake there's a clear winner
[2:08:53] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> for stream?
[2:08:55] <+ThomasOfTroy> Remake 2 is GREAT, unlike Remake 3 which needn't exist
[2:09:08] <%MrP33Ps> This game is comfort food man
[2:09:11] <+cdrom321> Zangief sounding like an IRL zombie.
[2:09:18] <+wolfe_leon> I still love the original but like pat I played it so much it's kinda like "yeah I know everything I need to do and can take 0 hits"
[2:09:19] <kitestar> 2make is a better representation of what a remake should be
[2:09:22] <Profmcstevie> Future pat thanks you
[2:09:24] <%TungstenViper> Licker + 5 zombies = just reset
[2:09:24] <+boomstarprime> remake 3 coulda been great they just need more nemesis chasing moments
[2:09:46] <superlit_1> I played RE3 once and then never touched it again. such a shame.
[2:09:51] <spacecatstreams> just finished my first leon run of this as my first resident evil game
[2:09:56] <%StebTheVee> The east hall, you have more room to go through enemies
[2:10:06] <%notsoy> lol those rounds say "steel boy", engrish will never not be funny
[2:10:08] <%baronblank> I loved platinuming this game and still need to get around to playing OG RE2
[2:10:21] <DSD24> The brute force way?
[2:10:28] <superlit_1> RE3 Remake*
[2:10:29] <%TungstenViper> @superlit_1 or actually make nemesis chase you through the whole game, like Mr.X here
[2:10:29] <andrejuhhhh> im a huge RE fan but i actually never finished 3make. just got bored about 5 hours in and said fuck it lol
[2:10:30] <+boomstarprime> is marv dead yet
[2:10:30] <%studleydoorite> you could also play it with your feet
[2:10:53] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> speedrun way is the best way
[2:10:53] <%studleydoorite> I have a feeling marv is going to make it this time
[2:10:55] <+RobertWayneLewis98> Are we on WR pace?
[2:11:00] <+FullmetalNinja25> Man I love the original RE2's soundtrack
[2:11:01] <+superchronicc> speed running birkin is hilarious
[2:11:01] <+Excel83> As replayable as this game is, and fun as it is... nothing beats the first time playing it.
[2:11:03] <Profmcstevie> Warrior, Tactician, Speedster
[2:11:07] <%blue_warzone> Marvin doesn‚Äôt die until after you go underground
[2:11:08] <DSD24> Time to talk to Claire
[2:11:09] <turdsman> been playing 3make in between baking today this is a nice surprise
[2:11:14] <CrypticMochi> I would‚Äôve liked 2 more levels with humanoid Nemesis in remake 3 and be cut some beast Nemesis for Carlos stuff
[2:11:14] <paynexkiller> Everyone ready for Leon and Claire's only cutscene together?
[2:11:14] <+ThomasOfTroy> The fact that claire's caution run is JUST BARELY faster than healthy is speedrun crack
[2:11:18] <%Visorak6> wr pace LUL
[2:11:20] <Kghaleon> WR runners would be done by now
[2:11:23] <paynexkiller> Here it comes! Don't blink! they're not on screen again till the end!¬¨
[2:11:23] <%StebTheVee> what made that helicoptor crash in this remake?
[2:11:36] <DSD24> Look how cute these two are
[2:11:38] <%XzileGaming> shes like "just stick it through the bars"
[2:11:44] <paynexkiller> Hell yeah, the debra glitch
[2:11:45] <+boomstarprime> that weird multiplayer mode in RE3 make had such shit netcode
[2:11:51] <%XelanArdel> this game gets crwdit for breaking my habit of having 1 save file
[2:11:51] <%MidnightBurst12> that's hilarious
[2:11:52] <topiodonk> yeyeye i love that one
[2:11:52] <Laecerelius> Wow
[2:11:53] <%TungstenViper> @StebTheVee you know... things
[2:11:58] <Ranger747> holy shit
[2:11:58] <DSD24> @XzileGaming I mean she's already wet
[2:11:58] <paynexkiller> knee cap debra and have glitch you through the stairs
[2:11:58] <+FullmetalNinja25> Y'know this is dumb they could easily kick that gate door open then again you could say that about any of the doors lol
[2:12:05] <+evilmagetim> Murry Crimbo Pat and chat!
[2:12:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE BLOODLINE
[2:12:10] <%baronblank> wow can't believe Pat missed the turn to make the helicopter crash push him forward
[2:12:13] <trianglehat> Leon I'm ovulating RIGHT NOW
[2:12:14] <%baronblank> failed speedrun
[2:12:17] <+Excel83> Pat you ever played the randomaizer Mod for this? It's a lot of fun
[2:12:19] <ComfyFox> claire strong woman
[2:12:19] <+kewlmyc> Damn shame no one in Resident Evil fucks.
[2:12:27] <+RobertWayneLewis98> she is wet
[2:12:28] <+ThomasOfTroy> @FullmetalNinja25 Kicking down gates and doors is a LOT harder than it seems
[2:12:32] <+RobertWayneLewis98> it is raining
[2:12:34] <%blue_warzone> Call Mr. White cuz they got some chemistry
[2:12:35] <KaironFortressKnight> no I'd rather die
[2:12:36] <%Visorak6> "dont tell me what to do"
[2:12:37] <%Deft_Thought> That scene is pretty cute, honestly.
[2:12:38] <%twistedj3ster> love you, Claire
[2:12:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @kewlmyc Wesker did
[2:12:42] <+superchronicc> are leon's weapons better than clarie's weapons? @PatStaresAt
[2:12:43] <DSD24> @kewlmyc Barry has kids so he at least counts
[2:12:45] <+KiwiRedgrave> "dont tell me what to do, bitch" - Leon Kennedy
[2:12:47] <%Deft_Thought> Their interaction is awkward but sweet
[2:12:47] <%TungstenViper> @kewlmyc Ethan does
[2:13:01] <fmbboaventura> Ah, the "knife the downed guy" meta. My favorite ocd thing to save ammo in re4.
[2:13:08] <%Tearonex> Marvin's gone bud
[2:13:12] <+FullmetalNinja25> Stop he's already dead
[2:13:13] <%XelanArdel> love it when a game just calls them zombies
[2:13:15] <DrkJP520> I wish Leon and Claire would interact more in this game. That was like the last time until the end
[2:13:29] <Aydarkzero> insta window
[2:13:31] <%MidnightBurst12> the door?
[2:13:34] <+kewlmyc> I don't believe any of your slander. All test tube babies and you can't prove otherwise.
[2:13:46] <%TungstenViper> Crazy Talk?
[2:13:56] <+RobertWayneLewis98> Mind Goblins Season 2: Stop knifing downed zombies
[2:14:04] <%Visorak6> What would you say is the hardest segment in RE for non-jank reasons?
[2:14:07] <%MidnightBurst12> I guess it becomes a door when he breaks in
[2:14:31] <willyfreshness> Use up all your ammo, slay those goblins
[2:14:35] <Shwepie> @DrkJP520 That's why I like the original more. It felt more like two people going through shit together.
[2:14:49] <+boomstarprime> poor marv
[2:14:55] <+Excel83> Trapping those zombies in the press room is a solid tactic for making that place safe
[2:15:37] <essence_of_lariatto> leon has a lot harder time with lickers then claire
[2:15:44] <DSD24> Pat do you like playing Leon or Claire more in either of the RE2 versions?
[2:15:51] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt New mind goblin idea Ammo conservation
[2:15:58] <%TungstenViper> ditch those brances
[2:16:07] <+SPARTAN_KD21> Yooooooo
[2:16:12] <spacecatstreams> i was suprised at the ratio of flame rounds to pistol ammo in claires run
[2:16:12] <essence_of_lariatto> I like leon more cause of popping heads with shotty
[2:16:20] <spacecatstreams> just drowning in flame rounds
[2:16:20] <nesbitt22> Did Pat ever see that New RE movie?
[2:16:24] <%Visorak6> @PatStaresAt did you see they added new content to disco elysium?
[2:16:32] <+Excel83> I always prefer claire, but I hate that Sherry section
[2:16:34] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I prefer Clarie in remake, Leon in OG
[2:16:35] <kitestar> Well I had enough for the ost swap
[2:16:45] <turdsman> there's no bowgun in this one right? I don't remember one
[2:16:51] <Manipulator98> leon for first run, claire for second run
[2:16:53] <+SPARTAN_KD21> @saphronblackbourne same
[2:17:03] <+Havictos> is it a jumpscare if you don't even see it?
[2:17:05] <%TungstenViper> this music
[2:17:07] <%baronblank> not gonna discard the used up bolt cutters?
[2:17:10] <kitestar> but not enough for a premium costume
[2:17:11] <+RobertWayneLewis98> no but do it tho.... please
[2:17:13] <kitestar> meah
[2:17:13] <KaironFortressKnight> Truly brave
[2:17:13] <DSD24> I like the song here
[2:17:17] <+SPARTAN_KD21> I think I prefer Leon in 2nd run in remake a bit more
[2:17:21] <DSD24> Battery!
[2:17:30] <%blue_warzone> Get the Rebecca photo
[2:17:37] <DSD24> Where's that uggo picture of Rebecca
[2:17:45] <+SPARTAN_KD21> I like the difficulty bump without being able to lean on gl in 2nd run with Leon @manipulator98
[2:17:50] <kitestar> They should have given the ost swap as a NG+ bonus
[2:17:55] <+Excel83> Ah, give me that inventory management relief
[2:17:58] <%TungstenViper> Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
[2:18:20] <+Havictos> @blue_warzone You mean Wesker's creepy jailbait photo?
[2:18:35] <Manipulator98> i just prefer claires 2nd run weapon for stunning zombies and hate the ammo change making leon's matilda useless
[2:18:40] <kitestar> smelly wesker
[2:18:40] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[2:18:42] <+Excel83> knife destroys lickers

[2:18:57] <+boomstarprime> sneaking mission
[2:18:57] <%twistedj3ster> I didn't know you could do that
[2:18:58] <DSD24> Just stab it repeatedly
[2:18:58] <ape_hawk> marty crimebus, assholes!
[2:19:01] <whimwhisp> Non intended I suspect~
[2:19:05] <+polothegreatest> Tech PogChamp
[2:19:06] <fmbboaventura> WElp, looks like they missed something in QA LUL
[2:19:06] <+SPARTAN_KD21> Hold up. That even works with the regular knife @patstaresat?
[2:19:07] <+superchronicc> knife damage tied to framerate
[2:19:13] <%TungstenViper> at 120 you melt everyone
[2:19:14] <Aussie_Manny> Ya call that a knife? THIS is a knife. ü•Ñ
[2:19:16] <Laecerelius> Machine gun knife
[2:19:21] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Everyone knows the Licker's weakspot is it's ass.
[2:19:24] <sublimedeer> just start shanking till is stops moving
[2:19:29] <kitestar> NG+ bonuses are quite OP ain‚Äôt they?
[2:19:30] <%FunkyStreams> thats how it worked back in the 90's
[2:19:33] <TurtlesAndTentacles> You on PC Pat?
[2:19:36] <+ThomasOfTroy> I've gotten my fps to 500+ and the final birkin fight was over in about 30 seconds
[2:19:39] <dullvivid> wait a minute
[2:19:43] <andrejuhhhh> that door trick is so cool
[2:19:52] <%pokefan9956> do you guys think pat's ass looked like a licker when his butthole popped out?
[2:19:56] <%twistedj3ster> that's smart
[2:20:03] <PanicSwytch> This a speedrun?
[2:20:06] <+Havictos> @ThomasOfTroy is your arm just a blur or what?
[2:20:15] <+superchronicc> that door glitch makes the locker encounter trivial
[2:20:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> CUT HIS BUTT
[2:20:22] <+RobertWayneLewis98> amazing
[2:20:22] <+Excel83> stunlock that bitch
[2:20:28] <%TungstenViper> Leon is tired
[2:20:33] <ChunLoArt> it staggers so much
[2:20:35] <Case_Ah_Dia> slash dat ass

[2:21:05] <%blue_warzone> Pat...
[2:21:06] <Profmcstevie> Blind myself to own the dead
[2:21:06] <eustine> right in the booty hole
[2:21:07] <Aussie_Manny> khadSnap
[2:21:09] <+superchronicc> i think you could have also shot that zombie down earlier
[2:21:12] <sweatch0> dont forget to take a Leon nap
[2:21:12] <+ThomasOfTroy> @Havictos I unironically don't know. I had the game in a 240p window on my 4k monitor, so I could barely even see the models
[2:21:16] <andrejuhhhh> youre stronger than me that would make me reset checkpoint
[2:21:20] <+Excel83> I remember when pat would have reloaded for less
[2:21:25] <%TungstenViper> you missed some ammo
[2:21:33] <%TungstenViper> behind the moving library
[2:21:34] <DSD24> Oh no Leon has a tummy ache
[2:21:37] <Aussie_Manny> Pat be like egghea4Knife
[2:21:41] <%baronblank> flashbang the zombie just to be sure
[2:21:46] <+RobertWayneLewis98> I'm playing state of decay so we are brothers basically Keepo
[2:21:49] <Shwepie> Old Pat would have reloaded a save to get that flash bang back. #NotMyPat
[2:21:55] <kitestar> lemme KNIFE you a question
[2:21:56] <Aydarkzero> yep
[2:21:58] <Aussie_Manny> What?

[2:22:26] <Aussie_Manny> Well, Claire is lighter.
[2:22:27] <kitestar> Yo what
[2:22:31] <Profmcstevie> The bite activates Claires SPEED
[2:22:35] <%TungstenViper> because reasons
[2:22:38] <+Infernal_Dalek> Pain spurs her on like a whip upon her back
[2:22:38] <%BigCoffee> speed runners are wild
[2:22:39] <spongeofmystery> Treat em mean, keep em keen
[2:22:40] <bedhouse> microdosing on T virus
[2:22:40] <turdsman> that's weird as hell
[2:22:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> trade meter for SPEED
[2:22:44] <%MidnightBurst12> less meat = faster
[2:22:48] <MegaDan_X> The more damage Claire takes the faster she is
[2:22:49] <Aussie_Manny> Claire gets speed from THE FEAR!
[2:22:54] <%TungstenViper> ...for now
[2:22:58] <DSD24> Grrr
[2:23:02] <emMmDeeKay> it's the power of her stand

[2:24:04] <Dr_Mooose> PepeHands
[2:24:06] <%TungstenViper> @nomolomo would you have the guts to do it?
[2:24:06] <akitanito> the medal fell off
[2:24:08] <Treasure_Vault> cause it's a secret, duh
[2:24:08] <+Infernal_Dalek> to help keep it secret, duh
[2:24:08] <eustine> cause its a secret

[2:24:13] <%MidnightBurst12> 'cause secret
[2:24:13] <gamezerox> it's closing to stay a secret
[2:24:15] <Aussie_Manny> Don't worry about it.
[2:24:18] <+extradopeness> to maintain secrecy
[2:24:20] <$Emperor_Machinus> can't wait to see see marvin in future games
[2:24:33] <Aussie_Manny> So does Leon not get a speed boost from being hurt?
[2:24:35] <+matf8> why does a police station even have one in the first place
[2:24:38] <jorkoal> bless you
[2:24:41] <%Visorak6> Pat why do you call Ryne baseball again?
[2:24:44] <Aussie_Manny> blehsoo
[2:25:14] <nomolomo> @TungstenViper after what he saw happened to everyone around him? probably. especially with that much pain
[2:25:29] <+yusefHD> I won't let you down.... 'BANG'
[2:25:37] <%Bailey__Gaming> Sleepy Me.
[2:25:37] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:25:45] <%TungstenViper> Did you know? the RPD has so many statues, pieces of art and secret passages because it previously was a Museum
[2:25:53] <+DovaDude29> A member of the Obama clan could be watching this live, and pat would never know. Shits crazy
[2:26:14] <DSD24> Its Frank West
[2:26:16] <spongeofmystery> Why'd he bite me?
[2:26:20] <akitanito> must have been thee wind
[2:26:20] <KaironFortressKnight> Must've been a rat
[2:26:21] <DSD24> Or his Voice Actor anyway
[2:26:22] <Profmcstevie> Why would a Museum have secret passages
[2:26:24] <%TungstenViper> @nomolomo yeah, but it's still tough man FeelsBadMan
[2:26:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IIIIIIIIIIITS BIG CHUNGUUUUUUS
[2:26:47] <Aussie_Manny> Nice head.
[2:26:50] <DSD24> Broken spine at least
[2:26:51] <+superchronicc> GROSS
[2:26:51] <%TungstenViper> here comes EYE MONSTER
[2:26:54] <+FlappySeal_> Damn it, Willy
[2:26:56] <+MisterAvry> oh yes, powdered sternum
[2:26:58] <turdsman> his vest is really strong
[2:26:58] <gamezerox> Body armor man
[2:27:03] <%machshop> Leon's too virile to be killed by that
[2:27:04] <+extradopeness> he's G'd up from the feet up
[2:27:07] <%Deft_Thought> Leon woulda died when the truck exploded and knocked him into a parked car in the beginning
[2:27:08] <%KnightOfTrousers> or at least some broken ribs
[2:27:09] <%shurtal> Hey, Bill
[2:27:09] <Aussie_Manny> Don't worry about it.
[2:27:10] <KaironFortressKnight> You didn't even try words Leon
[2:27:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> not looking pog Birkin
[2:27:18] <nomolomo> @TungstenViper for sure feels super bad man. big F
[2:27:20] <spongeofmystery> Is Birkin or Mr X Mongo?
[2:27:21] <%thebeargoesHONK> So Pat, going to see the new RE movie?
[2:27:22] <%TungstenViper> this theme kicks ass
[2:27:26] <sublimedeer> mashed stern with gooy heart and lungs
[2:27:32] <+Excel83> Leon's lines in this game are all so terrible. Every other VA sounds great except him
[2:27:44] <+eanscrale> well i'd hardly be in the mood to chat with a grenade in my face either
[2:28:14] <KaironFortressKnight> ew eyeball juice
[2:28:15] <Aussie_Manny> khadSnap

[2:28:32] <Aussie_Manny> MY EYES khadSnap
[2:28:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This sounds like Pokemon Ruby/Saphire music

[2:28:49] <%Cynical2DD> It does kinda
[2:28:53] <+FlappySeal_> It'a  remix of OG RE2, it's great
[2:28:54] <devanmuse> you're gonna get that knife back after this fight, right?

[2:29:26] <+BelricPsytar> Respect the pipe!
[2:29:26] <Aussie_Manny> oh cool, the metal in the environment gets damaged by him
[2:29:28] <Profmcstevie> Birkin DEFINITELY looks like he plays Sol Badguy, he got the gorilla swing energy
[2:29:43] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That has got to be the most resilient eyeball
[2:29:50] <+MisterAvry> "aargh, my gross arm eye!"
[2:29:57] <%TungstenViper> i really like that he switcher between his 1st and 2nd form throughout the fight
[2:30:10] <+Infernal_Dalek> Nice boss arena, I appreciate the destruction of the steam pipes.
[2:30:11] <%Cynical2DD> I finally beat RE8 the other day
[2:30:16] <+Excel83> Dont forget your knife

[2:34:23] <DSD24> Ada is so pretty in this game
[2:34:23] <hereiam407> Doggo
[2:34:24] <ComfyFox> Kreygasm
[2:34:25] <%TungstenViper> music fits so much
[2:34:26] <sun312772> yep
[2:34:27] <Aussie_Manny> BABE
[2:34:30] <%MidnightBurst12> bork busted

[2:34:43] <Aussie_Manny> Hellooooooooo, nurse! missze3Lovez
[2:34:48] <%Maids4lyfe> the dog was already dead
[2:34:50] <DSD24> You know she's hot cause she has a choker on
[2:34:52] <%AncelDeLambert> "I found this badge in a box of Cracker Jax, nice, right?"
[2:34:55] <+SPARTAN_KD21> @ape_hawk doggo was already dead
[2:34:56] <nomolomo> i like how even in cutscenes things dont die from just a single bullet
[2:34:58] <DracaenaLeaf> ADA WAIT
[2:35:05] <%Logoth_> ADA WAIT
[2:35:09] <%Bailey__Gaming> Ada putting the Ass in classified
[2:35:10] <%machshop> you're classified
[2:35:11] <spongeofmystery> The Makarov holds eight, you have to get a feel for how many you have left
[2:35:12] <%Visorak6> Classified is almost always situational anyway
[2:35:14] <+Excel83> ADA WAIT
[2:35:17] <+vexion_smh> ADA WAIT
[2:35:18] <fmbboaventura> Can you turn the game volume up a little bit?
[2:35:22] <%StebTheVee> Why does classified info exist?
[2:35:23] <%TungstenViper> also, FBI still goes around in trench coats and shades, like in the 50s. YEP
[2:35:25] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Why didn't she say CIA or something that would make how secretive she is make sense
[2:35:26] <+Arek_1> A D A , W A I T !
[2:35:27] <%SUITsWonderland> damn fbi after my secretes
[2:35:34] <Aussie_Manny> Claire Door. No Boys Allowed.
[2:35:35] <+superchronicc> always hatedd this section
[2:35:44] <%SUITsWonderland> Leon is made of tin foil though
[2:35:47] <%SUITsWonderland> so he is fine
[2:35:52] <+SPARTAN_KD21> @tungstenviper maybe Ada has a hangover LUL
[2:35:54] <+vexion_smh> The chase starts here
[2:35:59] <+Left_Justified> @Havictos CIA is international feds, FBI is domestic
[2:36:05] <nomolomo> do you prefer the part with ada or the part with cherry?
[2:36:06] <%SUITsWonderland> aluminium foil*
[2:36:12] <+FlappySeal_> was there not fixed camera dlc or am I remembering something non-existent?
[2:36:14] <churropoppa> I swear "classified" is just government talk for not white enough and too poor
[2:36:18] <+Excel83> Yeah there's a few rooms that are just resource sinks
[2:36:18] <sun312772> because it looks real
[2:36:22] <%Djinnazz> not unless your going for the magnum
[2:36:23] <marvel877> shotgun ammo
[2:36:26] <+superchronicc> one of them is a box of shotgun shells right?
[2:36:29] <Kghaleon> Does Minfilia's dialogue ever stop being a snooze fest?
[2:36:29] <APimpNamedSlickTrunks> Do the bobble heads stay gone once you pop them?
[2:36:39] <%TungstenViper> @SPARTAN_KD21 she clearly went to a party considering her dress LUL
[2:36:39] <Aydarkzero> yeah
[2:36:42] <%Djinnazz> yeah
[2:36:46] <eustine> That looks hella dumb
[2:36:46] <Aydarkzero> they are gone once you break them
[2:36:47] <%StebTheVee> Is that gun stock worth it?
[2:36:53] <Mr_JustinJones> there is
[2:36:56] <Aydarkzero> there is
[2:36:56] <%twistedj3ster> yes
[2:37:01] <Mr_JustinJones> 2
[2:37:04] <Aussie_Manny> 3? that's not so bad
[2:37:15] <+superchronicc> doggos
[2:37:16] <Mr_JustinJones> playing right now
[2:37:20] <+Havictos> @Left_Justified Yeah but when I think of FBI I don't think secretive and mysterious.
[2:37:20] <%Logoth_> Dont forget to obtain the mugnum parts
[2:37:33] <Aussie_Manny> OhMyDog AWOOOOOOO
[2:37:34] <%TungstenViper> this music tho bawkGasm
[2:37:36] <+superchronicc> shoot the dogs now pat
[2:37:36] <%StebTheVee> The blue herb look like a big crystal
[2:37:42] <+Excel83> Kill the doggos
[2:37:45] <DSD24> Pup Snuf
[2:37:49] <+Left_Justified> @Havictos atpCap look up COINTELPRO
[2:37:54] <%Djinnazz> killing these ones doesn't effect the dog count on the return trip.
[2:37:54] <Aussie_Manny> Are those dogs infected?
[2:37:56] <%TungstenViper> yep
[2:37:57] <+SPARTAN_KD21> @tungstenviper I bet Ada went out partying with her friends right before the city went to shit and then woke up with a massive hangover  thinking ‚Äúfuuuuuuuuuuuuck‚Äù
[2:38:03] <%Bailey__Gaming> can you still play this in your dreams like when you worked in retail
[2:38:04] <DSD24> Bork Busted
[2:38:04] <%Aleate> D:

[2:38:15] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I went afk, did Mr. X appear yet?
[2:38:23] <ComfyFox> But Pat, they're not zombie dogs yet
[2:38:26] <%Bailey__Gaming> pup snuffers
[2:38:27] <+toastybites> the peta technique
[2:38:28] <Aussie_Manny> So they were infected and caged, or caged then infected?
[2:38:30] <%baronblank> mr. x is not around yet no
[2:38:34] <+evilmagetim> Leon really is a cop
[2:38:46] <%TungstenViper> @SPARTAN_KD21 that's my canon now
[2:38:50] <APimpNamedSlickTrunks> one bullet could save you tons more
[2:39:05] <nomolomo> especially helpful in the sewer, with loads of 'sleeping' zombies
[2:39:06] <+foomaster22> Some big ass roaches
[2:39:07] <%TungstenViper> 4Head ah ah roaches
[2:39:10] <+Havictos> why are there giant bugs
[2:39:12] <+SPARTAN_KD21> @tungstenviper this is how I‚Äôve been thinking about it since the game came out lul
[2:39:13] <Aussie_Manny> GROSS
[2:39:27] <Aussie_Manny> boop
[2:39:30] <+superchronicc> you only need to be in here the one time, you couldve just saved the ammo

[2:40:23] <Aussie_Manny> Nice try, Michael Myers.
[2:40:23] <ape_hawk> nah, gotta slice him up some more, just to be sure
[2:40:23] <%TungstenViper> @SPARTAN_KD21 in the og it was more like a suspension of disbelieve thing since everyone wore bizarre and fashion outfits. even Jill in RE3, but in the remakes it feels weird LUL
[2:40:39] <Teneb0r> that music is still scary!
[2:40:49] <%Keyd00d> Keyd00d subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 54 months! Happy holidays streamer man

[2:42:20] <+superchronicc> @Excel83 its compulsive for him
[2:42:33] <%Aleate> I saw Leons arms doing that out of the corner of my eye and didn't realize he was on a ladder and thought he was running like that LUL
[2:42:48] <%baronblank> why don't you discard the used up key items
[2:42:55] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @Infernal_Dalek Everything does eventually. It's just a matter of if it's a passion project or a cash grab.
[2:43:00] <+Excel83> Pat has to make a poo

[2:50:02] <+Havictos> @cdrom321 Wrong about what that it's bad?
[2:50:06] <+SPARTAN_KD21> @cdrom321 lmao they‚Äôre going to deeply regret that choice LUL
[2:50:11] <%TungstenViper> you still need to go back
[2:50:22] <+FlappySeal_> I'm still sad RE3make felt super rushed compared to this
[2:50:31] <jahsmittsii> X gave it to em
[2:50:42] <%Monkeyweed21> why doesnt leon use his prehensile tongue to reach through the bars
[2:50:44] <%BigCoffee> It's criminal that they never implemented an official randomizer in this and in RE1. It would have given the game infinite replayability.
[2:50:45] <+cubbywolf> merry pasta rat every one
[2:50:48] <DracaenaLeaf> D:
[2:50:57] <Aussie_Manny> bleshoo
[2:51:02] <+SPARTAN_KD21> @flappyseal_ I think it‚Äôs worth getting at $30 and below
[2:51:06] <+cdrom321> @Havictos He thinks it's the best game Quantic Dream has ever made and that it's good because philosophy and David Bowie.
[2:51:10] <+SPARTAN_KD21> I just wouldn‚Äôt pay more for that
[2:51:12] <ape_hawk> pat are you gonna see m4trix?
[2:51:17] <%afronooch> thasa goblin
[2:51:18] <+D00msDayDan> new goblin content
[2:51:23] <%BigCoffee> I think your RE skills are good enough that you could manage it
[2:51:24] <%Djinnazz> new mind Goblin stream?
[2:51:25] <%Visorak6> mind goblins stream?
[2:51:25] <Kalakukkoo> more goblins
[2:51:26] <%Aleate> RE2 Randomizer Goblin Stream? psaGoblin
[2:51:27] <+SPARTAN_KD21> @cdrom321 LMFAOOOOO
[2:51:29] <+A0N33> Would that be a goblin stream?
[2:51:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> possible mind gob?
[2:51:30] <+Havictos> @cdrom321 Is he actually out of his mind?
[2:51:34] <%Deft_Thought> Did you ever play a Dark Souls randomizer?
[2:51:35] <eccentricprinceofroses> goblin stream?
[2:51:38] <%FunkyStreams> kinda seems like you play them so you dont have to.
[2:51:40] <+Excel83> You should, its so fun, makes it feel new again
[2:51:46] <+b_bang_> goblin deez
[2:51:46] <Tophattington> More like RanDUMBizer, am I right?
[2:51:48] <%baronblank> re2 randomizer stream would be so good
[2:51:48] <Tracazoid> The randomizer gobolin
[2:51:49] <ape_hawk> pat, play the new vegas randomizer
[2:51:52] <%BigCoffee> RE1 randomizer mod is more on point but the RE2 one was working really well as of 1 year ago
[2:51:54] <+Stormzcales_Lair> That coudl work for an item goblin series
[2:52:03] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt  You want to know where everything is for the perfect run each time right?
[2:52:12] <+Havictos> @cdrom321 Also what philosophy that demons want gamer souls?
[2:52:22] <%Djinnazz> Fallouts already random
[2:52:23] <ape_hawk> all randomizers are pointless
[2:52:30] <%Logoth_> Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Randomizer
[2:52:31] <+Havictos> no
[2:52:36] <%MidnightBurst12> ez
[2:52:45] <%BigCoffee> But wouldn't you like a new feel on what seems to be your favorite (or close) game series?
[2:53:00] <+matf8> is that a mind goblin pat, or just a preference?
[2:53:02] <ComfyFox> unless you hate animals
[2:53:05] <+FlappySeal_> what do you think zombie dogs even do when left alone

[2:54:01] <+MightyDuckShoes> does the randomizer make the game potentially unplayable or is it designed to have a limit to the randomness?

[2:56:49] <+cdrom321> @SPARTAN_KD21 @Havictos It started with a video five years ago after David Bowie had died in which he praised Omikron. Many in the comments referenced the SBFP LP and said that it sucks. Razor was pretty bitter about that, but I wasn't sure how bitter until his latest video in which is praises Omikron again and says that people only think it's shit because "two talentless stoner comedian lets-players are unfamiliar with a fucking keybind".

[3:11:31] <+moderatelycold> 3make was developed by b team right
[3:11:31] <DeniedPants> @PatStaresAt have you ever watched the video where they show what mr x does when he is off screen
[3:11:37] <%RyTYoung> He's just lonely guys Leon doesn't want to give him a hug BibleThump

[3:11:58] <Aussie_Manny> ONE PUUUUNCH
[3:12:02] <%cooldude69xx> That was the womkiest punch

[3:12:09] <TheeRabbi> Block punch with body: success
[3:12:16] <%MaritimeFox> Right in the liver
[3:12:17] <%Cynical2DD> I avoided Mr. X through my  Claire playthrough by lightly pushing up on the stick so Clair's boots would make no sound
[3:12:19] <Aussie_Manny> So Leon doesn't get the speed boost, only Claire?
[3:12:25] <%TungstenViper> Leon took that like a champ
[3:12:29] <%slimmixrp> Does running signal him too @patstaresat
[3:12:42] <+tnomads> i think that's a b route thing? could be wrong
[3:12:45] <+moderatelycold> it'd look rly goofy for him to chase you in certain rooms they made every right choice with mr x
[3:12:50] <%Monkeyweed21> yea post birkin
[3:13:04] <KaironFortressKnight> I wish Mr X would show up with a different style of hat every time you shot it
[3:13:12] <+MightyDuckShoes> there should random hats in the environment and X should constantly be donning a cap whenever he comes across one while capless
[3:13:53] <%slimmixrp> I see. thanks!
[3:13:55] <%Dakuu75> I always like the "kill everything" aprouch in RE games. makes it safe to back-track
[3:14:05] <%TungstenViper> i would have loved if the game rewarded you if you kept all the RPD keys in the item box
[3:14:05] <+AnarchyAside> Imagine X just having a Get Smoked hat on
[3:14:09] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @MightyDuckShoes His hat should get slightly bigger each time you encounter him.
[3:14:25] <Aussie_Manny> He's a big guy.
[3:14:36] <%cooldude69xx> @MightyDuckShoes And he should wear the hat in a randomized fashion each time
