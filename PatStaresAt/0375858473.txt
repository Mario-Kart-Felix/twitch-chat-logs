[0:13:41] <%Ell1ot> you should play with Paige so you'll win a game
[0:13:42] <%GohanEgret> @Dingus_Tickler he won on stream
[0:13:43] <+d00msdaydan> when are you woolie and plague gonna play it together
[0:13:45] <theInkShow> the FCUK SQUAD
[0:13:47] <+NopeBadguy> @angriestpat don't forget to let chungus eat so he can puke up the decos
[0:13:48] <sleepymastiff> Not interested in it because the movement is stiff compared to pilot movement
[0:13:48] <%theslippybrit> let em all die, solo play is only play
[0:13:49] <DirtyPopcornJ> he's right
[0:13:50] <Talyndemon> @AngriestPat What's your thoughts on the upcoming Monster Hunter movie?
[0:13:50] <sir_nack> i feel the same way about squads
[0:13:54] <+DeathByAttempt> How do you like Titanfall with no wallrunning, double jump, Titans, or speed-crouching? How do you like just plain CoD movement
[0:13:55] <%PalmtopNami> the movememt would have made tge game so good.
[0:13:56] <Sloavon> beat cat
[0:13:56] <%miodrag9> apatCaw BIRDSQUAD?
[0:13:56] <%ElenaManetta> Games that FORCE you to play with friends is the FAILURE OF THE GAME DESIGN
[0:13:57] <+arfafax> maxyyShrug
[0:13:58] <+blastazoid26> Yeah, thats fair
[0:14:01] <CalderGaming> the voice/waypoint macros are really good for playing with randos, tbh
[0:14:01] <LiquidMathew> isn't squad battle royale just counter striike match?
[0:14:03] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> It exists to fill the Titan fall 3 void because they cancelled it for that game
[0:14:05] <sleepymastiff> Also battle royales are too slow for my tastea
[0:14:05] <%RNGbob> BECOME THE APEX.... with help
[0:14:06] <%Dingus_Tickler> @gohanegret Pat actually streamed Blackout?
[0:14:09] <%nofestu2> Maybe games should be enjoyable

[0:48:28] <%skizzuto> EA secretly hates video games

[1:07:54] <%ThirdWelles> I fucking wondered why you had so much more ammo than me even though I was killing fewer enemies in my playthrough
[1:07:56] <$cureneckbeard> Did you see the Google doc on the number of times Pat made a statement during the Dark Souls LP where Pat was straight-up wrong? Like 1000 times somewhat wrong and 250 of those he was entirely and utterly wrong

[1:19:08] <$Chatterbox1991> mrdestructoid500 Been thinking about your talk about Anthem on the Podcast and further on with regards to Titanfall; i truly think there needs to be a new term for games that are a contradiction of Niche and Mainstream; Dragon Age: Inquisition, to use one example, is a AAA game in terms of budgit, marketing and overall quality, but people are so jaded by the rot of EA that people rebuke it and the people who do enjoy it end up enjoying it as niche in spite of it being AAA, TiF2 as well.

[1:34:38] <joestar1938> might just be because it's been a while since I've played this, but CHUNGUS doesn't look much bigger than I remember Jagress being.

[1:35:04] <ScreamingMeat> Do you have the Temporal Mantel?
[1:35:05] <DirtyPopcornJ> Pickle went Nope
[1:35:06] <+RadDuuude> lil Deviljho!
[1:35:06] <%Ell1ot> my only exposure to this game is through Pat. isn't this a monster that Pat kills easily all the time?
[1:35:07] <Sephrim> He drops T3 and 4 decos.
[1:35:08] <%Niney_Who> CHEATER
[1:35:09] <$Dutchpotato> He drops all tiers of decos
[1:35:11] <xeros720> everything coming up chungus
[1:35:12] <Nova712> CHEATS YOU MEAN
[1:35:13] <%Agent_For_Hire> Is that a DEVILJHO reference?!
[1:35:14] <UchiVsTheWorld> yeah i can see that you cheater

[1:35:18] <Reanimator83> Fucking pickle
[1:35:20] <Valdorick> RIP
[1:35:20] <%theslippybrit> im totally cheating to get big moneys, its great
[1:35:23] <%LogothX> Temporal mantle is for easy mode babies
[1:35:24] <%D_day> OMEGALUL
[1:35:29] <%sshen> Post your mod list on twitter Pat
[1:35:30] <%LogothX> and European extreme behemoth
[1:35:30] <%joylent_blue> Ell1ot its a super big buffed version of the first monster you fight yeah
[1:35:30] <%olliedelosa> Gotta cheat
[1:35:31] <weontheultralightbeam> is the performance better now on the pc version?
[1:35:35] <%RageCasanova> pat used mods its now okay for me to do so
[1:35:37] <%Tokanova> whats temporal mantle?
[1:35:37] <corrosivePaladin> He can drop warped. And gem only effects rarity chance. You can get attack gems from the most basic decorations
[1:35:41] <%Atomik456> he drops even higher very rarely @Sephrim
[1:35:42] <RekknLIVE> @Ell1ot same here, from a outsider perspective it looks like a huge unnecesary time dump
[1:35:44] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat He CAN be trapped
[1:35:45] <dekkitout> temp mantle auto dodges
[1:35:45] <%Tamamo_No_Mae_77> Sad part is his lighter jabs hurt just enough not to trigger mantle dodge.
[1:35:45] <%majorchange> just beat temporal mantle unlock quest. cheesed it out with gunlance
[1:35:52] <%theslippybrit> earn the poke trainer garbadge
[1:35:54] <%joylent_blue> Tokanova gives you invulnerability on majority of attacks

[1:36:23] <Sephrim> @Atomik456 Figured Worn (T4) was the highest.
[1:36:24] <%majorchange> yep
[1:36:25] <%Ell1ot> i think i get it. this is the lvl 100 chungus version?
[1:36:26] <%theslippybrit> cut that fuckers tail off
[1:36:26] <Zebroneath> You keep them even if failure.
[1:36:29] <+ZeekZaku> ryzen 2600 is recommended for tbis
[1:36:30] <%FrustratedAF> yes you keep them if the carts run out
[1:36:32] <UchiVsTheWorld> gottem
[1:36:34] <%FrustratedAF> is nice
[1:36:34] <Nova712> I haven't gotten very many good gems from it
[1:36:37] <%Bane_Kaikyo> yes, cause ther are items you pick up as opposed to rwards
[1:36:39] <%yeknomlive> yeah. but if you beat him he has rarer feystones i think
[1:36:41] <+MrMcCrabby> you get better gem drops for actually killing him though so try not to cart
[1:36:43] <%FrustratedAF> pick them up tho WutFace
[1:36:46] <%majorchange> JUICY TAIL HITA

[2:13:03] <%Laecerelius> Pat doesn't have the jet sword?!
[2:13:05] <%valriot> ITS THE BEST
[2:13:06] <corrosivePaladin> Pat you dont need the sword you need some actual armor
[2:13:07] <%Solidnick18> It's the best greatsword
[2:13:08] <%omegasis> usually around like 4ish
[2:13:10] <+Camail> Yes
[2:13:10] <TwistedVerse> why, Vern? whY
[2:13:10] <shevan123> you cant kill handheld
[2:13:10] <+HelloImTom08> why would even using anything other than the rocket sword
[2:13:10] <%valriot> 2 probably
[2:13:11] <%nmaten> 4
[2:13:11] <%Nikopol1717> Only like 3-4 runs yeah
[2:13:12] <%Solidnick18> 4
[2:13:12] <+MrMcCrabby> like 3 or 4 but its not hard
[2:13:14] <ScreamingMeat> It's the best GS in the game with an Elementaless build
[2:13:15] <%omegasis> absolutely
[2:13:17] <KingVantq> Yes
[2:13:17] <Daniel_Is_I> Yes

[2:19:38] <%StrawberryPantsu> @AngriestPat When's Xenogears?
[2:19:39] <ScreamingMeat> It's designed to max out crit and raw damage
[2:19:40] <+applefibs> the best girl in the game is Gentle Fourth, no doubt

[2:33:05] <IminyourBase> he smells of lesser pee
[2:33:05] <Valdorick> He doesn't smell of Red Bull and Mustard?
[2:33:07] <%Skrypto> Like fucking POPCORN
[2:33:07] <%ElenaManetta> Elmo essentially had Binding of Issac powers
[2:33:11] <%theslippybrit> emlo for motor kombat confirmed
[2:33:13] <%Big_Dream> becasue cats are smelly
[2:33:15] <ScreamingMeat> Most do
[2:33:15] <waifoong98> They do, I have a cat
[2:33:16] <jobbedbone> THEY LOVE IT
[2:33:18] <%Fruitywhompus> onlyif theyre ticklish !!
[2:33:18] <%skizzuto> that's super not true of any of the cat's I've owned
[2:33:22] <DirtyPopcornJ> Smells like lupus and gout
[2:33:22] <r_Foeburden87> dependns on the cat
[2:33:23] <%ElenaManetta> he's biting you
[2:33:24] <$daveronald> they like the first 3
[2:33:24] <Mnightshyamallama> it depends on the cat
[2:33:25] <Valdorick> If your cat hates your belly rubs, your cat doesn't love you.
[2:33:26] <+emperri> cats hate belly rubs that go for more than 30 seconds
[2:33:26] <tank7013> Yes Elmo the most normal cat
[2:33:27] <danknugglit> Cats like attention
[2:33:28] <Jaysky> Some might hate them, some will pretend to like and use it to attack
[2:33:29] <%Ahack13> Depends on the cat.
[2:33:31] <DirtyPopcornJ> depends on the cat really
[2:33:31] <%Calek> I have a cat and he loves belly rubs
[2:33:31] <dekkitout> nothing hats belly rubs
[2:33:31] <ArtooKilledYou> That’s a lie
[2:33:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Fuck you my cat likes belly rubs
[2:33:31] <%ThatGuyfromMars> he's playing
[2:33:33] <+ZiggyLetards> my cat hates me in general
[2:33:34] <%ThePuddingDead> it depends on the kitties temperament and how much they trust u
[2:33:34] <%ooblagis> Most do, not all. Elmo has no survival instincts, so he's fine with them
[2:33:35] <+Prinny_Raider> Travis Touchdown got his cat to lose weight through belly rubs
[2:33:36] <pimpinahz> they love it like any other pussy
[2:33:37] <+SoarFlyer> @emperri lies
[2:33:37] <Mr_Strut> Elmo's a special cat
[2:33:40] <%ElenaManetta> Elmo is literally calling you out on stream
[2:33:40] <%Remery_> even humans!
[2:33:40] <UchiVsTheWorld> it takes a while for cats to get used to belly rubs, mine used to hate it, but now she is into it
[2:33:41] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> oh no elmo attack
[2:33:41] <ScreamingMeat> He hates it
[2:33:41] <%Skrypto> Hes bipping you nao
[2:33:43] <+Nomicro4u> Cats love any type of rubs... until they hate it
[2:33:46] <%joylent_blue> as a kid i tried to rub a cats belly and almost lost a finger
[2:33:48] <Sinister_Aglet> He love's belly rubs *attacks pat's hand*
[2:33:48] <+fantom_flasch> If cats are relaxed they like it, but if they aren't they will attack
[2:33:50] <%Remery_> Girlfriends love it!
[2:33:51] <%theslippybrit> pat hates pussy
[2:33:55] <%Skrypto> lookit his teeny legses LUL
[2:33:56] <alcors_wisdom> its a cat to cat thing i have a dog that loves being scratched under their chin and the other hates it
[2:33:58] <DirtyPopcornJ> I'm rubbing my cats belly right now and she's just there happy
[2:33:59] <%theslippybrit> and dead cats
[2:34:02] <TwistedVerse> elmo is half sloth, he must climb your arm
[2:34:10] <%ElenaManetta> Cats that grow up with people and cats that don't
[2:34:10] <waifoong98> But mine is Both LUL
[2:34:11] <$cureneckbeard> He's doing his best!
[2:34:12] <%skizzuto> yup sounds about right
[2:34:15] <Valdorick> My cat is that one to everyone in the house but me!
[2:34:16] <+Nomicro4u> some cats are Tsun Tsun
[2:34:17] <DirtyPopcornJ> truth
[2:34:17] <%ThatGuyfromMars> tsundere cats
[2:34:20] <%connos_livereview> and sometimes they are the same cat
[2:34:22] <%StrawberryPantsu> Then ther's the Tsundere type of cat
[2:34:23] <a_mad_dragon> also cats change between those two types every five minutes
[2:34:23] <%theslippybrit> i can has the bat? he is friend?
[2:34:23] <+fantom_flasch> Most cats are both
[2:34:25] <Mr_Strut> So tsuntsun and tsundere?
[2:34:26] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Both equally lovable
[2:34:26] <+SoarFlyer> more like Bad Dragon
[2:34:26] <%valriot> I have 2 cats, one loves belly rub but hate head scratchin, and the other is the total reverse, and will just let you Playdoh his face all day
[2:34:27] <deviljhojho94> look at these goobers
[2:34:27] <%maskedriderhero> Its also a fluff ball
[2:34:28] <ScreamingMeat> Dragons have 6 limbs
[2:34:30] <%Divryne> Big Bad Dragon.
[2:34:32] <tank7013> My moms cat is nice to me when other people are around and a total bitch when we're alone
[2:34:33] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@konekoryugamine)
[2:34:34] <%Skrypto> If you shaved Woolie's head it'd look like that
[2:34:37] <UchiVsTheWorld> its a bat SQUIRREL dragon
[2:34:38] <Jaysky> My sister had a cat that had a tendency to do drive-by claw swipes on my ankles. Fun little scamp.
[2:34:41] <%joylent_blue> the bat dragon puffs up its neck real big when its mad
[2:34:43] <%Remery_> So Tsun
[2:34:44] <Valdorick> Cats are the ultimate Tsundere, except when they're not... then they're Yandere.
[2:34:51] <dekkitout> no, that is an affront to god
[2:34:51] <%Prism_Wing> There's also the third type that is just a more agile and independent dog that jumps off all the walls.
[2:34:54] <+Camail> bat rat
[2:34:56] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Kinda?
[2:34:57] <+SoarFlyer> @ScreamingMeat get that nerd shit out of my monster hunter stream

[2:41:06] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You've obviously never been to florida in the summer
[2:41:06] <frozenottsel> it's not the heat that kills you, it's the humidity

[2:42:43] <thesw1tch> I never boil salt water. pat what are you talking about. fresh water boils at 212 and 100 the same
[2:42:44] <%Skrypto> it was -48c here last week
[2:42:46] <%vaporousTippler> 0 is cold. 100 is hot. Fahrenheit is better for people, Celsius is better for science.

[2:43:34] <%arfafax> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[2:43:37] <Daniel_Is_I> But Pat, you're salty. Why don't you use fahrenheit?
[2:43:37] <%theslippybrit> what is this educational shit?!
[2:43:38] <ShichiNoBushi> I think 100°F was calculated to be the normal human body temperature. Though it's actually off.
[2:43:38] <waifoong98> LUL
[2:43:38] <DirtyPopcornJ> wasn't it mercury or am I nuts?
[2:43:39] <%yeknomlive> the freezing thing he's right about but i never heard of the boiling thing though
[2:43:39] <+DrunkenDice> hmmm lytPATHETIC
[2:43:41] <%ElenaManetta> It's like measuring damage numbers in video games. It just FEELS better when the numbers are higher
[2:43:42] <a_mad_dragon> farenheit set his measuring so that freezing and boiling were 180 degrees apart
[2:43:44] <+Nomicro4u> the more you know
[2:43:45] <+Ooodaschunky> Bruh retake your community college classes
[2:43:47] <+Cavumentum> The Moon is an American and she thinks YOU ARE BIG WRONG
[2:43:48] <+applefibs> pat is INCREDIBLY wrong
[2:43:48] <DonatelloJose> The more you know *Jingle*
[2:43:49] <dekkitout> tl;dr if you like to count by 100, use metric and celsius Kappa
[2:43:52] <%Skrypto> I feel like I know less no
[2:43:53] <TwistedVerse> math? in my monster hunter stream? fuckin ew
[2:43:53] <%Skrypto> w
[2:43:55] <%TECHNO_OUTLAW> apatHoldon apatBig apatWrong
[2:43:56] <IminyourBase> crazy talk pulls of it's most craziest of talks and rewrites history
[2:43:57] <%falineth> I heard it was just the temperature range where the guy lived
[2:44:00] <frozenottsel> but Kelvin tho
[2:44:00] <+StromkoPenguin> Farenheit gives more numbers to work with in temperate climes so it's not 1 or 2 differences C every day. There's no actual benefit but when you're raised F you can't switch.
[2:44:01] <%rdark_ksu> fuck you pat wtf is its 22 degrees and we go outside for fun. wtf is that shit
[2:44:02] <%ooblagis> Everything he said sounds right to me
[2:44:02] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat brb looking at our lunar accomplishments
[2:44:03] <Intolerable> You couldn't be any wronger if you tried @AngriestPat
[2:44:04] <+applefibs> LUL he's as salty about being wrong as his fictional water
[2:44:04] <ThespianBarrage> Multiples of 10 for life!
[2:44:05] <%theslippybrit> fuck your reading rainbow science guy talk! just kill more monsters!
[2:44:08] <Abovebiggerbob> Celsius is for foreigners
[2:44:09] <%ElenaManetta> I'd rather do 100 damage than 10 damage even if the actual conversion is the exact same.
[2:44:10] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Pat is scaring Paige away with Math
[2:44:12] <%claudesavegely> slap a non-ele gem in that shit
[2:44:15] <%Divryne> Pat. apatWrong
[2:44:15] <ThDark> @fruit_pie_the_magician Where I live it's never been 30 for more than a day. I can recall only one instance of it being 30, and only in the morning
[2:44:17] <%RageCasanova> damn missed all the science
[2:44:18] <%Gatzarlok> If Celsius is so great, why don't you go LAND ON THE MOON CANADA
[2:44:19] <danknugglit> F is for stinky poopoo heads
[2:44:21] <BigZam> Oh yeah, a good sword. Now slap Non elemental into it
[2:44:21] <%thewordofhelix> shiny!
[2:44:23] <$SleepyMaribo> now upgrade it
[2:44:24] <sayaman012341> Just join the #kelvincrew
[2:44:26] <TwistedVerse> pat you can boil my salt water any day KappaPride
[2:44:28] <DonatelloJose> SCIENCE RULES
[2:44:29] <dc_8100> CRAZY TALK
[2:44:30] <Ubu2933> I do not want to admit I didn't know you could do smithy stuff in the gathering hub
[2:44:32] <grayjammer> @NWR_James Russia had more space accomplishments than america.
[2:44:34] <%Skrypto> the moon is for PUSSIES
[2:44:36] <%Prism_Wing> I have a Bachelors degree in degrees SwiftRage
[2:44:37] <%theslippybrit> oh my science!
[2:44:37] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@deviljhojho94)
[2:44:40] <natebud> Fahrenheit is more accurate than Celsius.
[2:44:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It froze overnight maybe five or six times in 18 years
[2:44:42] <%ooblagis> He's right though, why are people acting like he isn't ???
[2:44:43] <+RushUnplugged> hey you F sctubs NASA USES CELSIUS, you landed on the moon with REAL NUMBERS, suck it
[2:44:45] <%Superstarsage> @Ubu2933 is a mod
[2:44:46] <+Ooodaschunky> @grayjammer Can't hear you from the MOON leaf
[2:44:46] <Caivyre> only garbage countries use Fahrenheit
[2:44:48] <%joylent_blue> Ubu2933 its a mod if that makes you feel better
[2:44:49] <a_mad_dragon> farenheit was basically sniffing his own farts when he came up with his system
[2:44:50] <+emperri> celsius is for fedora tippers who think being mathematically logical is more important than having more granularity in the range of temperatures encountered by a human
[2:44:51] <%arfafax> More accurate? lobosgame
[2:44:51] <%theslippybrit> poobot is back
[2:44:53] <SchroedingersFerret> Brine freezes at 0 degrees F. It's illogical if as long as you suck at explaining it.
[2:44:57] <LunarLancaster> Celsius is for people who don't know what Mars' surface looks like KKona
[2:44:57] <+Prinny_Raider> Elementless for BIG DAMAGE
[2:45:00] <thesw1tch> so, if its salt water, it freezes at 0 Celsius, and fresh water boils at 32 Fahrenheit. pat I studied science. that's not how numbers work
[2:45:00] <IminyourBase> stealing other youtubers material now?
[2:45:01] <%CerberusDriver> ayyy
[2:45:02] <%Nobrev> stick non elemental damage on that sword
[2:45:09] <%LogothX> non elemental!!
[2:45:11] <%yeknomlive> look at that beautiful affinity
[2:45:11] <TwistedVerse> chungoes
[2:45:16] <%arfafax> Y'all are some ignorant motherfuckers Wowee
[2:45:16] <+EtheralFlameX> Pat's right I just wiki'd it
[2:45:17] <iwishtobetheprincess> augment the gas powered stick, pat
[2:45:18] <fruit_pie_the_magician> DO BEHEMOTH FOR THE ARMoR
[2:45:19] <waifoong98> AH I caused all these CHAOS and I LOVE IT spyCappa
[2:45:23] <+Ooodaschunky> Lul mod deleted "both scales are arbitrary"
[2:45:23] <ScreamingMeat> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:45:24] <OToole42> heyo pat and chat, how goes it?
[2:45:25] <%theslippybrit> i'll order the jumbo chungo
[2:45:28] <TwistedVerse> is that like.. mango flavored chungus?
[2:45:28] <IminyourBase> put in non elemental up
[2:45:30] <jobbedbone> They're both arbitrary and multiples of 10 is just as useless from a mathematical standpoint. something with more factors than 2 and 5 would be better
[2:45:31] <DonatelloJose> language and science are human constructions of the mind.
[2:45:34] <+Emperor_Bad> pat has never been wrong we all know this
[2:45:36] <Minorou> Big and strong now
[2:45:39] <%joylent_blue> Ooodaschunky moobot hates all caps
[2:45:39] <+GunEden> do behemoth so we can laugh at you
[2:45:42] <KeiPrime> the real measurement standard should be chungus sizes
[2:45:44] <%ElenaManetta> That book animation is so fast and awkward
[2:45:46] <%greenhathero> kelvin is the real loser
[2:45:51] <%yeknomlive> i love that daft punk song bigger harder
[2:45:51] <TwistedVerse> super size my chungu, my dude
[2:45:53] <%omegasis> wow, pat hasn't gotten an elementaless gem yet?
[2:45:56] <%ooblagis> apatBig 3, Pat is right. Celsius uses Fresh Water for 0 and 100, Farenheit uses Salt Water for 0 and 100
[2:45:57] <%theslippybrit> just let him eat it pat
[2:46:04] <PicklePants> pat, I think I have figured out your character, is it iron tarkus junior?
[2:46:04] <%Skrypto> <3
[2:46:07] <frozenottsel> prrrr
[2:46:07] <Caivyre> do behemoth so your balls get ultra-exposed
[2:46:10] <%joylent_blue> he good boy
[2:46:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yes he has, I saw it
[2:46:11] <%bestwaifuritsu> she shoves the book so far into your face it causes everything around your immediate field of view to blur LUL
[2:46:11] <Naixoram> is that the HR version of Wyvern Ignition too?
[2:46:13] <%ElenaManetta> Touch his butthole
[2:46:13] <%Skrypto> sweet dreams Elmo
[2:46:13] <%Gatzarlok> Celsius should be used when talking about water, Fahrenheit should be used when talking about humans, and kelvin should be used when talking about atoms...
[2:46:20] <%theslippybrit> because you dont, totally dont
[2:46:21] <+Cavumentum> LANGUAGE & NUMBERS ARE FAKE, VALIDITY IS A MYTH, drink your milk
[2:46:23] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat What's your favorite monster in World before Iceborne adds more?
[2:46:25] <jobbedbone> HUMANS ARE MOSTLY WATER
[2:46:26] <TwistedVerse> phew
[2:46:27] <danknugglit> Fight at xeno if you want to punch your tv
[2:46:27] <+mmSoTasty> maybe stream lag
[2:46:28] <%konekoryugamine> So, I was thinking. Yoko Taro crossing Nier Automata with FF14 means 2P is now canon. And this means his cross in SOul Calibur is now canon. What ELSE is canon now?
[2:46:29] <+RushUnplugged> F fans literally too salty to understand basic math
[2:46:30] <%joylent_blue> 3
[2:46:36] <arfsm95> @angriestpat in rio de janeiro 40 to 45 Celsius is a common thing
[2:46:37] <%DexteraXIII> 3
[2:46:37] <+applefibs> yes, but what is the melting point of a human?
[2:46:38] <redsynod> 3

[2:46:48] <%yeknomlive> nigel's cool
[2:46:50] <%theslippybrit> which i believe means a whale's vagina
[2:46:50] <+StromkoPenguin> Every time someone says humans are X % water I hear a completely and drastically different number.
[2:46:51] <iwishtobetheprincess> odoggo is my fav
[2:46:52] <%SvenHolgersson> Nerg fucking SUCKSSSS
[2:46:52] <%ElenaManetta> I ain't no ocean baby
[2:46:54] <KeiPrime> Zelda, Tekken, Spawn, Xenosaga are all canon now

[2:47:07] <%Arxel1> Loser nerds, do explain WHY in the HECK would Fahrenheit be better to explain human body temp??
[2:47:08] <Daniel_Is_I> Lagi is great except in the water
[2:47:08] <danknugglit> Chungus is actually fun
[2:47:09] <+applefibs> more like NERDigante
[2:47:09] <%XzileGaming> but Brachydios sucked for design
[2:47:09] <%maskedriderhero> What about Khezu
[2:47:12] <%konekoryugamine> If Tekken is canon to Zelda now, then I have some SERIOUS questions to write.
[2:47:13] <thesw1tch> 0

[2:47:25] <%omegasis> Valstrax tho
[2:47:26] <+StromkoPenguin> @arxel1 Because bigger numbers, and also 101 degrees = call a doctor. Really easy to remember.
[2:47:26] <mayorrev> fortuna just went live on switchframe

[2:47:43] <%ElenaManetta> WHO
[2:47:44] <xiccy> Zinogre
[2:47:46] <%LogothX> Someone is cosplaying old dante there
[2:47:46] <+StromkoPenguin> @arxel1 Or more like 101 degrees = take some nyquil and pray, but y'know what I mean.
[2:47:47] <natebud> Hey look a DMC
[2:47:47] <%Mornaka> COLD
[2:47:49] <%yeknomlive> seregios is super cool
[2:47:50] <DirtyPopcornJ> Chungus go down
[2:47:51] <Minorou> They advertised Nergy as a monster that is hyper aggressive. It dissappointed me to see that it runs away when injured.
[2:47:52] <jobbedbone> @RushUnplugged base 10 based systems do nothing for you if you're going to use scientific notation anyways.
[2:47:52] <%SvenHolgersson> Hes a big bomby boi
[2:47:52] <TwistedVerse> WHO'S STREAMING??
[2:47:54] <%Remery_> gimme the TUNA
[2:47:57] <%RageCasanova> guess im gonna have to get a stronker pc so i can watch the stream and attempt to play at the same time rip wesker
[2:47:58] <Jaysky> Brachy design is fine, he has a gooey pompadour and boxes with people
[2:47:59] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat What old monster would you like to see in Iceborne? I'm hoping for Rajaang
[2:48:01] <%valriot> Dio best monster, he dunk he explode
[2:48:02] <waifoong98> "enjoy Fortuna" HAHAHHAHAH said nobody ever
[2:48:03] <+emperri> @Arxel1 because the range of human body temperatures in celsius is so small compared to the scale that you need decimals?
[2:48:05] <+Camail> this spawn is TERRIBLE
[2:48:06] <mayorrev> ok thanks
[2:48:08] <%connos_livereview> i need money fortuna
[2:48:13] <+mmSoTasty> those damn Gajalaka
[2:48:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> CATCHMOON
[2:48:16] <%konekoryugamine> So this means we can possibly see Nier cross with Tekken in the near future and it will be considered canon?!
[2:48:18] <KeiPrime> whats thebig tusk frog from 4u
[2:48:18] <Baconrath> @Remery_ SabaPing
[2:48:19] <person181> life is being in combat

[2:48:21] <waifoong98> enjoy your knockdown lads
[2:48:21] <KeiPrime> tetsucabra, tat one
[2:48:26] <%arfafax> @emperri Oh no. Not decimals!? lobosGame
[2:48:31] <%Arxel1> StromkoPenguin That's no easier tho. Smaller scale of like 20-40 is easier than 80-100. Also, more than 35-36 C is also an easy to remember warning sign xD
[2:48:36] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat What old monsters would you like to see in Iceborne? I'm hoping for Rajaang
[2:48:36] <tank7013> Although I still hate the name changes for Dino and Raizex
[2:48:42] <grayjammer> wow.........
[2:48:45] <SchroedingersFerret> You guys can't even convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin in your head? smdh
[2:48:46] <PicklePants> anyone wanna go suck each other off listening to opera music?
[2:48:47] <+fantom_flasch> The fatter you are significantly decreases what % water you are
[2:48:49] <brambobelurkin> he playing PC?
[2:48:49] <%konekoryugamine> I can only handle so many universes being canon to another before my brain just IMPLODES.

[2:49:38] <iwishtobetheprincess> is pat afraid of of rajang going ultra instinct in world? LUL

[2:49:42] <%theslippybrit> run coward!
[2:49:43] <+StromkoPenguin> @arxel1 Mostly we just use Fahrenheit because we're used to it, and we'll never stop because we are crazy lazy.

[2:50:38] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 50m.
[2:50:42] <%Skrypto> Roly Poly
[2:50:43] <Dvvolf> need more non-lizard monsters bring back monkeys, boars and other stuff
[2:50:47] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat I've never played any MHs before World so my impression Rajaang is purely on his design and that I think is armor looks cool.
[2:50:47] <KeiPrime> more plesioth types, give everyone the hip check
[2:50:51] <dekkitout> or- use kinsect glaive tajC
[2:50:52] <Hydrapissed> nah I want bugs
[2:50:53] <%konekoryugamine> Man I jsut hate lizards like that.
[2:50:56] <Hydrapissed> give me more giant bugs
[2:50:57] <+emperri> i love celsius so much, 0 is freezing and 100 is boiling, which is important because 1/10th of a boiling is an intuitive measurement that it makes sense to facilitate
[2:51:03] <TwistedVerse> chungus has left the chat
[2:51:03] <+skylerpilot> we already know that Nargacuga is in but its Ice so we for sure will see atleast a couple of these. Zamtrios, Lagombi, Barioth, Kezu / Gigginox, Ice Barroth. Would be sick to get Shovelface back as well (Ukanlos)
[2:51:04] <waifoong98> @Dvvolf I mean, Gen XX got a bug with Wheels
[2:51:05] <Hydrapissed> More weird in mon hun PLZ
[2:51:06] <%yeknomlive> seltas queen but i know it's not gonna happen
[2:51:09] <%konekoryugamine> I have more issues with giant bugs than I do with giant lizards. It's weird.

[2:53:08] <KeiPrime> damn, i kinda miss Greatsword. i went insect glaive on pc vers
[2:53:18] <OToole42> only thing better than a big meaty sword swing, is if you got jets on it
[2:53:19] <KeiPrime> i should build that thing
[2:53:22] <%Remery_> Now beat it ass while it's having a seizure :)
[2:53:30] <%ooblagis> Does every single person who plays this game use the Greatsword?
[2:53:32] <+skylerpilot> The Directors of MHW also both said they would love to get the Lich King armor from WoW into the game. So with Iceborne a Possible WoW Lich King cross over could happen with a Syndragosa fight
[2:53:34] <TehLankyGuy> Does he know he should be picking up all the pieces?
[2:53:36] <Baconrath> im one of those silly longsword people

[3:03:26] <Valdorick> I was lucky, my first stream stone was not only a hero stream stone, but one for my weapon! I was happy, because before that, I didn't know that streams dropped by weapon type!

[3:05:22] <+applefibs> what's the over/under on Pat forgetting to remove the mod that cheats in his upgrade materials before streaming?
[3:05:23] <TwistedVerse> he mirin
[3:05:23] <ScreamingMeat> I don't care. This might have MP but it played as if it's SP and your cheating doesn't effect others games at all
[3:05:23] <natebud> Hows this game when you aren't playing co-op?
[3:05:31] <LunarLancaster> "So I did some grinding off screen..." -Patrick Boivon
[3:05:38] <danknugglit> LIE STEAT CHEAL
[3:05:41] <%joylent_blue> natebud more fun
[3:05:44] <TwistedVerse> Grindy Fuckboiven
[3:05:45] <$cureneckbeard> Gotta cheat
[3:05:48] <onetrueking27> you even got like 3 footing jewels
[3:05:51] <%theslippybrit> sure, its our fault
[3:05:58] <%TeraMercier> @natebud Pretty great until you get to decoration farming, like 40 hours in maybe more
[3:05:59] <%LogothX> nice dive
[3:06:01] <+SpikedFreak> @natebud all except one monster scales down to 1, so it works well solo
[3:06:01] <TwistedVerse> :L
[3:06:02] <Valdorick> The cheating?
[3:06:13] <Simmonds91> Cheating is wrong.. except the cheat that makes nergigante thimas the tank engine
[3:06:16] <natebud> That's what I hoped everyone would say.
[3:06:18] <Simmonds91> Kappa
[3:06:18] <Ordinaryknight> Does he have the temporal mantle?
[3:06:23] <%LogothX> It might be good to wait until he runs away to loot his borf

[3:06:33] <Reanimator83> Big cheats for big bois
[3:06:34] <+applefibs> No, he said he doesnt believe in using baby blanket
[3:06:35] <TwistedVerse> big whiff
[3:06:36] <%Faustgesicht> Is this event still live on PS4?
[3:06:42] <Zteck123> Its not cheating unless you get caught
[3:06:43] <%tiishi> so many shiney things
[3:06:45] <SiegeJay> @Ordinaryknight Nope. He dropped off before Lunastra
[3:06:48] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat Lunastra is a pain in the ass to farm but she has really good Blast weapons and her armor is dope. Health Boost AND Stamina Boost if you wear most of the set
[3:06:49] <TwistedVerse> @Zteck123 correct
[3:06:54] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This event is simultaneous on all platforms
[3:07:01] <%Faustgesicht> nice
[3:07:01] <%theslippybrit> not if youre a scrub
[3:07:03] <Valdorick> You can not, no.
[3:07:08] <Simmonds91> its up until 22nd?
[3:07:12] <Simmonds91> or 26th
[3:07:15] <Simmonds91> i think
[3:07:16] <IminyourBase> what you should do is just quit the mission right now and walk away with your spoils rinse repeat
[3:07:20] <%coffeeabomination> Plane walker david sounds like a MTG nerd and I respect that
[3:07:21] <danknugglit> Remember kids, winners dont get caught cheating
[3:07:23] <KeiPrime> you can change loadouts , cant you?
[3:07:24] <+applefibs> you can kinda, if you have decos in a piece of armor, you can change armor pieces
[3:07:24] <%LogothX> Nice, a warped stone
[3:07:29] <TwistedVerse> bug chungus with the big drops :L
[3:07:30] <%NME_Dom> lots of warped
[3:07:35] <%theslippybrit> wheres my monster hunter anime where pat just gets dunked on by real monster hunters
[3:07:40] <SiegeJay> Is this a mod to make drops more noticeable? PogChamp
[3:07:41] <%Faustgesicht> how bout fucck no
[3:07:44] <IminyourBase> it's the lamest! but it's fast
[3:07:44] <Ion_LaserX> Winners don't do drugs. Winners Cheat
[3:07:47] <%joylent_blue> awww yeah optimum farm strats
[3:07:48] <+Silentman0> capturing chungus is best
[3:07:49] <+applefibs> @SiegeJay yes
[3:07:52] <+mmSoTasty> you get a bunch of worn and warped decos for finishing
[3:07:53] <+Nomicro4u> he want to say hello
[3:07:53] <TwistedVerse> winners get chicken dinners
[3:07:55] <ltbabylucien> HI EMLO <3

[3:07:58] <+Nomicro4u> Hi Elmo

[3:08:03] <SiegeJay> FUCK! I want this on Console! Capcom!!!!
[3:08:03] <IminyourBase> killed like that guy
[3:08:04] <natebud> almost got chunked
[3:08:04] <%tiishi> let the baby talk haha
[3:08:04] <%DedlokPM> Elmo's banning everyone in chat again
[3:08:05] <%skizzuto> COMMAND US LORD Elmo
[3:08:06] <+mmSoTasty> most of the decos chungus drops are complete trash
[3:08:06] <%joylent_blue> RIP Dante
[3:08:07] <ShichiNoBushi> He's trying to shit-post just like daddy.
[3:08:09] <Valdorick> What you should do Pat, is quit out this mission, talk to the Blacksmith, "Crash" because of "a bug with your mods", have the stream go down "randomly", then come back with a augmented sword Kappa
[3:08:09] <%theslippybrit> emlo mad cus we dunking on dady
[3:08:11] <person181> tell us your wisdom elmo sensei
[3:08:12] <%TeraMercier> That kind of grinding is awful for streams
[3:08:14] <TwistedVerse> eZ
[3:08:14] <Simmonds91> @siegejay it is
[3:08:16] <PicklePants> I was timed out for caps, cuz I'm stupid, sorry about that, I'm gonna go now, maybe watch some old machinima videos, most likely sanity not included, bye bye everyone, see you next time!
[3:08:16] <ScreamingMeat> NO! You get Warped Faye Stones at the end of the quest, and they have the highest chance of dropping top tier decos
[3:08:20] <%Skrypto> smashed
[3:08:23] <Simmonds91> @siegejay right now
[3:08:25] <KeiPrime> he died giving you info..
[3:08:25] <danknugglit> Real winners cheat AND THEN DO DRUGS
[3:08:26] <+mmSoTasty> @SiegeJay what do you mean?
[3:08:28] <%theslippybrit> stump his shit!
[3:08:46] <TwistedVerse> snort all the red bull
[3:08:47] <natebud> real winners do drugs then celebrate with more drugs
[3:08:48] <SiegeJay> @AngriestPat Don't Quit. Completing the quest guarentees a 8 Rank Deco
[3:08:52] <%theslippybrit> @danknugglit dana white approves this message
[3:08:55] <ScreamingMeat> He stops dropping fay stones after you pick up 30
[3:08:56] <%joylent_blue> PicklePants don't sweat the caps, its happened to me at least 5 times at this point
[3:08:58] <Zteck123> Doing drugs is technically cheating though
[3:09:05] <Valdorick> Champions cheat while doing the drugs.
[3:09:06] <danknugglit> LUL
[3:09:18] <SiegeJay> I want this mod that makes drops more noticeable on consoles. Come on Capcom
[3:09:22] <alrobot2014> fools. champions cheat while SELLING the drugs
[3:09:24] <danknugglit> CHEAT WITH DRUGS
[3:09:24] <TwistedVerse> so that hit..
[3:09:29] <$AechRhett> wait. this isn't pokemon
[3:09:33] <KeiPrime> if you dont cheat, you obviously didnt want to win enough
[3:09:34] <%theslippybrit> just cheat pat
[3:09:43] <Valdorick> CROSS COUNTER Pogchamp
[3:09:47] <%Fruitywhompus> big sword make big numbers
[3:09:49] <Valdorick> One day I'll remember how to emotes...
[3:09:50] <Daniel_Is_I> You could go LS and foresight slash them
[3:09:52] <Jaysky> Never liked GS
[3:09:55] <LunarLancaster> Cheaters never win, except when they do
[3:09:58] <+Rukuojin> Has Pat fought Luna or Behemoth yet?
[3:10:05] <ScreamingMeat> You get 1-2 or more Warped Stones and they have the highest chance of giving the high rank decos
[3:10:06] <%theslippybrit> pats the first person ive seen fail to cheat and still deny it
[3:10:09] <Ubu2933> damn I wish I could break away from my insect lance but I've tried and I'm terrible at the slower weapons
[3:10:10] <IminyourBase> how excited are you for the movie?
[3:10:17] <Zteck123> Fuk Behemoth and the game it came from
[3:10:30] <Jaysky> What movie? There's no movie, it doesn't exist. Move along now.
[3:10:31] <ScreamingMeat> Not. At. All.
[3:10:39] <waifoong98> What are you talking about Kappa
[3:10:44] <count_bob> Honestly, I want to see the movie.
[3:10:44] <Simmonds91> all this "just cheat" reminds me of that guy who made a website selling armour sets for like $100
[3:10:48] <Hydrapissed> jesus that movie
[3:10:49] <count_bob> I'm so excited.
[3:10:49] <%connos_livereview> milla jobobich

[3:10:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> DO BEHEMOTH
[3:10:53] <Ion_LaserX> Oh yeah that Alice 2.0 movie nobody wanted
[3:10:55] <Hydrapissed> its gana be either a shite show or the best thing ever
[3:10:56] <+mmSoTasty> there is no movie and there never was, good day sir

[3:11:10] <%joylent_blue> behemoth (puke)
[3:11:10] <+applefibs> "play it like an MMO fight" = spend 4 hours doing runs, then bitch about randos for a week straight
[3:11:12] <KeiPrime> how do you get it to do that?!
[3:11:17] <natebud> I download warframe now.
[3:11:17] <+Cigwynn> It's Jho! zoneHype
[3:11:17] <arkv01> so can anyone explain why we're genociding jagras
[3:11:18] <Valdorick> The monster hunter skips a stone across the lake, sighing at the handler "And what has the commission ever done for me!? I'm poor, and have iron weapons!"
[3:11:20] <%theslippybrit> mads mikkelsen for wesker
[3:11:25] <Hydrapissed> I mean just get a squad of 4 and toast behe

[3:11:36] <%ElenaManetta> I will play Darkest Dungeon while I watch Pat fight a fat lizard for 4 hours
[3:11:38] <Simmonds91> @arkv01 he looked at me funny
[3:11:39] <Nova712> so don't run with randoms...?
[3:11:43] <Zteck123> Any game that has turn-based fighting is bad, only good thing about FF is Sephiroth
[3:11:46] <%theslippybrit> it even sits like emlo
[3:11:47] <+mmSoTasty> she's in a stinky sweaty ffursuit
[3:11:48] <KnightsTemplar13> Jagras; The Final Solution

[3:12:09] <TheHylianGuard> @Zteck123 Paper Mario would like to have a word with you about turn based combat
[3:12:11] <%Bt_Robot> @AngriestPat Did you ever see that video of a party of four snipers shooting a Jagras to death?
[3:12:11] <danknugglit> Pat is racist to cats
[3:12:13] <%AncelDeLambert> PAT
[3:12:14] <natebud> Pat do you even love?
[3:12:15] <+SulfurousAcid> do you pet the pig?
[3:12:16] <SiegeJay> @AngriestPat Handler is in her final form
[3:12:16] <%joylent_blue> i forget the Poogie exists I'M SORRY
[3:12:17] <%Remery_> I just stayed up until the Japanesee players were online and called an SOS
[3:12:17] <%theslippybrit> mads mikkelsen for wesker!
[3:12:17] <%yeknomlive> my poogie hates me
[3:12:19] <arkv01> pat will you doogy into my mouth
[3:12:20] <+mmSoTasty> they stopped letting you change decos at base camp back with the whole deco duping thing
[3:12:22] <person181> pat is evil confirmed
[3:12:22] <Valdorick> Poogie is the pig, as a reminder.
[3:12:23] <Jaysky> Why love poogie when you have a cat?
[3:12:24] <%valriot> you monster
[3:12:26] <Naixoram> Pat have you seen the movie Polar?
[3:12:30] <+SulfurousAcid> rub the pig for luck
[3:12:33] <@PlagueOfGripes> did PC ever get those other monsters
[3:12:37] <+applefibs> pigs are food, not friends
[3:12:38] <Reanimator83> Love me moonSwine
[3:12:38] <%connos_livereview> more like who-gie
[3:12:41] <Hydrapissed> or make a load out that does not blow hey ohhhhhh
[3:12:44] <Jaysky> Which monsters Plague?
[3:12:45] <Simmonds91> i hear wearing rainbow pigment increases drops or something
[3:12:50] <SiegeJay> @PlagueOfGripes Yes. PC as of now got all monsters
[3:12:51] <KeiPrime> if you dont pet your poogie, the chungus wont hock the loogie
[3:12:52] <Hydrapissed> The monsters girls?
[3:12:52] <Zteck123> Not bait, I generally hate turn based games, which is why I love Xenoblade, but hate FF
[3:12:53] <Jaysky> Behemoth?
[3:12:53] <troytaco> my friend made me watch polar
[3:12:55] <Simmonds91> or is it having it unlocked..
[3:12:55] <natebud> Did someone say Polar Express?
[3:12:55] <Valdorick> Yes @PlagueOfGripes .. oh wait shit... HI PLAGUE
[3:13:00] <%DedlokPM> @Zteck123 Your wording is wrong because you are stating an opinion, not a fact. "I don't like turn based fighting" would be the correct wording.
[3:13:00] <arkv01> I assume plague is talking about all the other ones
[3:13:03] <troytaco> what a shitshow
[3:13:09] <%Remery_> i heard monster girls
[3:13:13] <arkv01> y'know, the ones that require the downloadan
[3:13:16] <%ElenaManetta> He has the KH3 spirit inside him he just won't let it out
[3:13:17] <+applefibs> PC has all monsters, but not all Arch-Tempered quests
[3:13:20] <@PlagueOfGripes> did they ever add transmog or are we still using the mod
[3:13:28] <Hydrapissed> still just mod
[3:13:28] <Valdorick> Still mod : /
[3:13:32] <Hydrapissed> lots of layerd though I guess
[3:13:34] <KnightsTemplar13> John Carpenter Themed Monsters
[3:13:37] <TheHylianGuard> @DedlokPM I think it was pretty obvious he was stating an opinion without him having to spell it out
[3:13:37] <dekkitout> hoo hoo, cmon riku, lets go save aqua, even though this is MY FAULT, ho ho
[3:13:38] <@PlagueOfGripes> dumb. expected
[3:13:39] <+mmSoTasty> lots of good layered options tho
[3:13:45] <%joylent_blue> why would they put transmog in the game, thats DUMB ResidentSleeper
[3:13:46] <Zteck123> I know what I typed Dedlok and I stand by it
[3:13:47] <arkv01> is PC version still prone to that error crash
[3:13:55] <+Eddy21forsaken> "Are you a black?" -Mickey online
[3:13:57] <waifoong98> Can we have ARTS in this game PLS
[3:13:58] <%Urgotfantasy> Hello plague "Not a furry" of gripes
[3:14:03] <%Remery_> just want the Kulu set transmog
[3:14:05] <@PlagueOfGripes> drew tonight. haven't RE2'ed in a few days
[3:14:05] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat I know the MH movies gonna suck because it sounds like it's going to be the Doom movie all over again. It's going to be set in modern world and have generic army guys led by #StrongFemaleCharacter fighting monsters. It's worse than nothing
[3:14:11] <mayorrev> hewwo pwague! OwO
[3:14:13] <natebud> what a spaz
[3:14:24] <%LogothX> apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead
[3:14:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> No transmog that I know of
[3:14:26] <SiegeJay> @PlagueOfGripes Transmog is limited on PC. Not all the Layered armors are not gonna be on PC because Alloy, Ryu, and Egypt man are exclusives
[3:14:27] <+RushUnplugged> @arkv01 nah it got fixed ages ago, it runs fine now
[3:14:30] <Ion_LaserX> I'd take nothing over Alice 2.0
[3:14:30] <dekkitout> "imma kill it"
[3:14:30] <@PlagueOfGripes> although I put my RE2 parts so far on youtube and the first part got copyright claimed by some guy. not a company. just some guy
[3:14:32] <%DedlokPM> @TheHylianGuard "Turn based fighting is bad" is not stating an opinion. That wording is for stating FACT. Except that is not a fact at all.
[3:14:32] <Ubu2933> eat at the camp canteen for terror in the handlers new face looking in the oven
[3:14:43] <Hydrapissed> some guy lol
[3:14:43] <+Eddy21forsaken> Plague drew more of his daughters for his dragon ball channel
[3:14:49] <Valdorick> I want the MonHun movie to just be a renamed version of the Shadow of the Colossus script.

[3:26:07] <KishinGrek> Hey plauge, loved the 20 min video
[3:26:09] <%arfafax> Pat engage apatBig butt faucet?
[3:26:21] <DonatelloJose> Wait what happened?
[3:26:24] <+mmSoTasty> I gotta solo Chungus with an evasion set, he's tough
[3:26:25] <Ugato> nah, he engaged a mountain of salt
[3:26:29] <%VanaSkiller> pat got trashed
[3:26:29] <MalignantUpper> break time
[3:26:40] <A_d3adly_zambo> Pat got chungus
[3:26:49] <Ugato> he got chunged on hard
[3:26:56] <nina9669> the rewards are worth the damage though
[3:26:56] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Your butt cheeks never touch poop if you spread them fully across the toilet. LUL
[3:27:09] <Ugato> ur poop is touching you RIGHT NOW
[3:27:11] <RazHarvey> pat is just going for a quick fap, guys give him a sec
[3:27:13] <+mmSoTasty> Lunastra Gamma is amazing for anti bullshit. except to get it you have to farm AT Luna.
[3:27:26] <MutedMimic> SourPls
[3:27:27] <$cureneckbeard> poop only touches your butt cheeks if you are fat
[3:27:34] <DonatelloJose> Shouldn’t that happen more often? These monsters aren’t meant to be solo’d
[3:27:40] <%VanaSkiller> theres a Luna Gamma?
[3:27:40] <DonatelloJose> Right?
[3:27:46] <deviljhojho94> Is this the stream of Patrick "5 Feet in more than one place" Boivin?
[3:27:49] <MalignantUpper> this is why squat toilets are superior
[3:27:51] <danknugglit> They are
[3:27:51] <KishinGrek> You can never wash the poop away, its inside you
[3:27:51] <+D2_Synua> Is this the end of the stream?
[3:27:53] <dekkitout> i thought they were given how the games cuts down your payout
[3:27:55] <%TheHeroNobodyNeeded> can't confirm what if you have huge booty cheeks but ain't fat?
[3:27:56] <+mmSoTasty> these are meant to be soloed more than ever, with the scaling they introduced in World
[3:27:57] <nina9669> all monsters can be solo
[3:28:08] <RazHarvey> even behemoth?
[3:28:13] <nina9669> yes
[3:28:14] <+mmSoTasty> yes, but it's HARD
[3:28:15] <RazHarvey> neat
[3:28:20] <+D2_Synua> Behemoth is definitely not meant to be solo'd
[3:28:22] <+mmSoTasty> especially extremoth
[3:28:22] <@shinsaryn> I heard Chungus is here. I am here to eradicate
[3:28:26] <%TheHeroNobodyNeeded> neato burrito
[3:28:29] <Ugato> behemoth isn't necessarily designed like that, but most of the monsters are designed to be solo'd
[3:28:33] <DonatelloJose> Ah, that explains the salty pat. Thank you chat <3
[3:28:33] <dekkitout> unless you have a broken bow or gunbow build
[3:28:33] <paprikaei> plupCHUNG plupCHUNG plupCHUNG plupCHUNG plupCHUNG plupCHUNG
[3:28:33] <Ugato> and it's often easier to solo them
[3:28:36] <deviljhojho94> Only monster I haven't been able to solo is gogmazios because he is a colossal bitch
[3:28:36] <danknugglit> Behemoth and kulve are only ones who dont scale
[3:28:37] <+mmSoTasty> I'm not insane enough to attempt Behemoth solo
[3:28:42] <ScreamingMeat> Behemoth is FUCKED
[3:28:42] <nina9669> behemoth can but its hard
[3:28:42] <Ugato> because you don't get the ridiculous MP health scaling
[3:28:46] <+mmSoTasty> welcome back!
[3:28:47] <Valdorick> Hi Pat!
[3:28:50] <RazHarvey> our savior is back!
[3:28:50] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer500 alrighty bois, here's my tip for all you and pat, go with SnS, (the best weapon) stack up on urugan parts, part-breaker, and wide range. Now either around buffing and healing the team (allowing you to scoop the vom as necessary), throwing on the challenger mantle and drawing aggro, and laying in with shield bashes when he's knocked down. Drop trapped meat all over, and it's your job to dung pickle
[3:28:53] <+mmSoTasty> more chungus!
[3:28:54] <+SulfurousAcid> did you finish shitting your pants

[3:36:00] <%connos_livereview> until brexit
[3:36:02] <ltbabylucien> My cat apparently has Opinions about me watching this. She's chirping all over the place.
[3:36:03] <%theslippybrit> now i dont look like a total baller in front of twitch friends
[3:36:03] <+applefibs> they had to convert canadian dollars to fahrenheit
[3:36:04] <+Maids4lyfe> technically you still donated 10 dollars, it just appears as american numbers

[3:36:25] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@bananachode) (warning)
[3:36:25] <+applefibs> they add saltwater to canadian dollars to get the US dollar amount
[3:36:26] <%Trinity5> you mean podcast sponsors?

[3:37:17] <danknugglit> Canada money is weak and America money is stronk
[3:37:20] <%TeraMercier> Cause Canada doesn't have a deficit larger than other countries entire GDP
[3:37:20] <%connos_livereview> could be worse could be zimbabwe money
[3:37:20] <+mmSoTasty> poisoncoats are pretty common. worth a lot less trade in points than para coat, sleep coat or blast coat
[3:37:25] <Betablitz> so would it be better to pay in american?
[3:37:31] <%TheKillerKalamari> they tried universal currency and it crashed

[3:48:07] <+mmSoTasty> ooo this'll be fun
[3:48:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You have to do another hunt before behemoth
[3:48:15] <greatgrizzington> Relish the Moment!
[3:48:19] <PsychedelicSnake> Has Pat beat Behemoth for that sweet Drachen
[3:48:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But its pretty cool
[3:48:24] <danknugglit> FIRE RESIST
[3:48:29] <nina9669> does luna and teostra
[3:48:30] <$Order_of_Mystery> that palico had a discoball afro, what the fuck
[3:48:33] <+Camail> pay should scam out behemoth
[3:48:33] <danknugglit> Big fires
[3:48:34] <+mmSoTasty> @VanaSkiller I dunno, seems a little quicker than regular tempered quests
[3:48:36] <%theslippybrit> behemoth resist
[3:48:37] <ScreamingMeat> Golden Pickle
[3:48:41] <%joylent_blue> behemoth sucks a big dong
[3:48:44] <Hydrapissed> normal behe is ez pat
[3:48:47] <PsychedelicSnake> Behemoth is bad. Mostly because other players suck.
[3:48:54] <%VanaSkiller> @mmSoTasty you can get 30 jewels in less than 3 minutes by not fighting him and only making him vomit
[3:48:55] <Greywolf47> extremoth is wher the true pain lies
[3:48:56] <%theslippybrit> pat is high in challenge resist

[3:49:25] <PsychedelicSnake> I wish I had MMO buds to play with me Feelsbadman
[3:49:26] <+Camail> behomoth special event quest sucks, but the optional reocurring version is great
[3:49:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I play exclusively with randos and it makes behemoth really hard
[3:49:28] <+mmSoTasty> @VanaSkiller but most of those are trash ones. he can sometimes drop like 6 or 8 worn/warped upon completion
[3:49:29] <Arweynn> CRAZY TALK
[3:49:41] <+Risingxiv> even if they dont suck, extreme will get you
[3:49:41] <Valdorick> I'm the carry for my team : /

[3:50:23] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> What the fuck is that?
[3:50:26] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat apparently when they add Geralt to the game it also gonna bring a bunch of mechanics from the Witcher with it. Kinda like how Behemoth has Raid Mechanics
[3:50:26] <a_mad_dragon> those motherfucking cacti
[3:50:33] <%Demon_Shadow4> so final fnatsy is cannon in mh now?

[3:51:56] <Valdorick> You have to fight Teo first.
[3:51:57] <+applefibs> AT Teo is only allowed in Elder's Recess

[3:52:46] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL not bringing the fire mantle
[3:52:48] <Valdorick> @AngriestPat Don't forget your fireproof mantle before you fight Luna... YOU'LL NEED IT!
[3:52:50] <%arfafax> apatJpeg lobosSub ezaSophie
[3:52:54] <%theslippybrit> no one can stop garbage bagman
[3:52:57] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @DedlokPM Same here. He can plead all he wants, it's useless!
[3:53:01] <+mmSoTasty> @VanaSkiller plus, you can beat chungus real fast solo if you've got the setup
[3:53:12] <%joylent_blue> not having fireproof mantle monkaS
[3:53:13] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat's friends need some practice
[3:53:16] <+Camail> that was a...questionable flash
[3:53:16] <PsychedelicSnake> I just realized Pat doesn't have the temporal mantle. He will know suffering.
[3:53:19] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @PsychedelicSnake "Oh, you thought I was gonna do a Nova like fuck-boi Teostra? Just for that I'm gonna make this zone unlivable." - Lunastra in a nutshell
[3:53:19] <%Tokanova> Yesyesyesyes!
[3:53:23] <Valdorick> "Do I even have it" is not a comforting statement before fighting Luna.
[3:53:24] <%Tokanova> BIG damage
[3:53:24] <Ugato> get them horns
[3:53:29] <Greywolf47> has the big chungras been goo to any of you guys?
[3:53:30] <+Camail> PsychedelicSnake yea you get it after this quest chain
[3:53:36] <Greywolf47> good*
[3:53:46] <%VanaSkiller> @mmSoTasty I mean yea, but its still not worth killing him when the rewards are just more of the same
[3:53:47] <%calvarok> is chungus a rabbit boss in this case or just some type of large lad
[3:53:48] <luckysteak> lunastra is the toughest monster, in my opinion
[3:53:56] <PsychedelicSnake> Once I got the temporal mantle I never fought Lunastra again. She's just so goddamn annoying
[3:53:56] <%theslippybrit> does bag o milk taste different from bottle o milk?
[3:54:00] <+Camail> extremoth is the hardest fight, bar none
[3:54:06] <ScreamingMeat> Is the DMCV demo gonna be timed or permanent?
[3:54:16] <+mmSoTasty> @VanaSkiller they're not though, that's what I'm saying. they're warped and worn. same chance at something good as any other warped and worn.
[3:54:20] <+Camail> i've done everything else, haven't even tried that fight yet
[3:54:20] <%awsomesaucekirby> apatBlep
[3:54:21] <deviljhojho94> Does teostra have the bullshit supernova on world too?
[3:54:26] <%theslippybrit> pats wearing fish nets
[3:54:27] <%Tokanova> Yes
[3:54:27] <Ugato> poor longsword got his helmsplitter screamed
[3:54:29] <Sephrim> Wish Lunestra's fire mechanics worked a bit better.
[3:54:29] <deviljhojho94> fuck
[3:54:31] <%Tokanova> The NOVA is big
[3:54:31] <%joylent_blue> ScreamingMeat i've not heard of it being timed, not sure
[3:54:33] <+Camail> every time he flashes hit him with the :( emote
[3:54:35] <Valdorick> Damn, nice dodging.
[3:54:36] <YujinChan518> hi
[3:54:36] <PsychedelicSnake> Do these guys think Teostra works like Lunastra and you can bait out a nova?
[3:54:39] <deviljhojho94> i hate teostra s much

[3:54:57] <deviljhojho94> Ye
[3:54:58] <luckysteak> I used flash to bait out a nova when I was safe. only way to be sure
[3:55:05] <Sephrim> Like, dousing those purple flames with water is supposed to destroy them but it doesnt look like it works all the time.
[3:55:08] <%VanaSkiller> @mmSoTasty you can pick up warped and worn tho from vomit, I've done it plenty, and pat has done it on stream not even an hour ago
[3:55:15] <%theslippybrit> crush its horns and make boner pills!
[3:55:19] <deviljhojho94> I used a web timer for the nova LUL

[3:57:09] <%VanaSkiller> @mmSoTasty how fast can you kill Chungus?

[3:57:19] <%Urgotfantasy> D:
[3:57:19] <Geno4344> I didn't know this game was featuring dante from the devil may cry series
[3:57:20] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat NO BULLY ELMO
[3:57:25] <danknugglit> PETA
[3:57:26] <%MrBorisMakarov> DONT BOOLI HIM rooBooli
[3:57:31] <%theslippybrit> dont bully sackmo
[3:57:36] <ltbabylucien> Pat plz just love Emlo
[3:57:41] <DonatelloJose> He is doing his best. Peach will find out.
[3:57:42] <%shattywack> wth is happening with Monster Hunter?? Dante and final fantasy monstars?
[3:57:45] <1stpigeon2scuba> Some say the couch is a green screen and pat is atop a baddragon
[3:57:45] <%VanaSkiller> @mmSoTasty the fasted you've seen, multi or solo?
[3:57:46] <ScreamingMeat> Why does he get the cool version of the male Rathian set?
[3:57:46] <PsychedelicSnake> It's so weird hearing english voices after having MH language on
[3:57:50] <+mmSoTasty> @VanaSkiller haven't paid attention. probably around eight to ten minutes
[3:58:07] <%theslippybrit> why is pat in the game? or did someone make that joke already?
[3:58:09] <Greywolf47> kills teostra but he ran away makes perfect sense.
[3:58:16] <danknugglit> Just wait for the mhw x witcher 3 crossover
[3:58:25] <%Yum438> apatJpeg
[3:58:26] <PsychedelicSnake> Lunastra and her nova in the arena LUL
[3:58:36] <Valdorick> Dante isn't strange, he was in SMT: Nocturne after all, and is part of the CAPCOM family... Behemoth though.
[3:58:45] <spinbel> Is that a public session?
[3:58:45] <ne0bunny> I love seeing people question why theres weird cross-over shit in MHW. bitch have you never played a monhun game before? this is normal for the entire series
[3:58:46] <Greywolf47> I was a bit disappointed by dmc event in world cause there was so much possiblity there
[3:58:51] <%shattywack> Man I've been away from this game for too long
[3:58:52] <PsychedelicSnake> !GAME BROKEN!
[3:58:59] <%DrFacilier> unplayable
[3:59:02] <%ThePeacefulDream> Graphics card at risk!
[3:59:03] <danknugglit> Unplayable
[3:59:08] <Greywolf47> deviljho may cry would've been perfect
[3:59:14] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat someone made a mod that turns Teostra into Simba from the Lion King
[3:59:20] <%Skeletorexplains> eat big
[3:59:25] <%VanaSkiller> @mmSoTasty ok so, if it takes 8ish minutes, you can do a vomit only run at least 3 times yielding at minumum 90 jewels and average of 6 warped and worns
[3:59:27] <PsychedelicSnake> @ne0bunny I actually kinda wish World got more of the weird-ass weapons and armor from earlier games. Like those goddamn candy weapons
[3:59:34] <Valdorick> But is there a mod that give Luna the "come hither" eyes?
[3:59:36] <%axellogic> cutscene!
[3:59:38] <%theslippybrit> will you bring us diet cokes?
[3:59:42] <%patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat No, you smell

[3:59:49] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[4:01:49] <%TheSniperJoe> YEP
[4:01:52] <+timblenaut> yup, consistent AoE that doesnt stop
[4:01:52] <+mmSoTasty> @VanaSkiller white and blue don't really drop any of the decos I want.
[4:01:55] <%awsomesaucekirby> Cool drink
[4:01:57] <Valdorick> Luna = Exists = Does heat damage. Bring Cool drinks.
[4:01:58] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat cool drinks, the monster
[4:01:59] <+Camail> lunastra in this arena is way harder than even tempered lunastra, imho
[4:02:00] <%trez_> is this pats first luna?
[4:02:00] <TerryTheTurret> @Atomik456 Oh yeah I heard about those before, I believe he's also the guy from Ace Combat 5 that tells you about missions results.
[4:02:04] <PsychedelicSnake> Fireproof mantle and cool drinks are a must
[4:02:05] <dekkitout> chicks with blue fire are usually bonkers like that
[4:02:08] <BakerBrute> @AngriestPat You're gonna want Astera Jerky
[4:02:08] <%Tokanova> she's the hottest lady in all of monster hunter!
[4:02:09] <deviljhojho94> me too bb
[4:02:12] <EdgyOnPorpoise> Damn that's a cool fire effect though
[4:02:13] <%Tokanova> ;)
[4:02:14] <spinbel> Were we given the ID session?
[4:02:15] <+mmSoTasty> Lunastra makes Teostra look like a kitten
[4:02:15] <+fantom_flasch> Lunastra is WAAAAAAY morse
[4:02:16] <danknugglit> Babys first luna
[4:02:19] <%VanaSkiller> @mmSoTasty mmm theres also weapon and playstyle preference I guess
[4:02:19] <Greywolf47> I hated teostra in 4u
[4:02:23] <+MetalMeltdown31> You are going to DESPISE Lunas.
[4:02:23] <%Aydarkzero> man Lunastra fight ResidentSleeper
[4:02:24] <PsychedelicSnake> Lunastra is so goddamn awful that it makes me like Teostra by proxy
[4:02:24] <alwayspronking> More than Pao?
[4:02:25] <ltbabylucien> Oh man that is a beautiful monster though...
[4:02:27] <+AlphaAgito> Also you only have 15 minutes
[4:02:28] <Tucker0603> @spinbel it's only subs
[4:02:32] <%Tokanova> 4u Teo was a biiiig bitch
[4:02:33] <%UchiVsTheWorld> thats lame pat
[4:02:34] <spinbel> Ah, thanks.
[4:02:38] <Kaede_Viz> If your learnt to use a weapon other than GS teostra would be easy...
[4:02:39] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Oh, yea. Here's Big Bitch Lunastra. Fuck this monster. And her fuck-boi friend too.
[4:02:40] <danknugglit> I like teo. Luna actually sucks ass
[4:02:47] <+applefibs> i thought teo was easy as fuck, but maybe that's just down to weapon choice
[4:02:54] <%Tokanova> she's like teostra ON SPEED
[4:02:59] <PsychedelicSnake> Teo is easy as shit with IG in my experience
[4:03:01] <%Tokanova> monkaS
[4:03:02] <+mmSoTasty> super cool monster. not fun to fight.
[4:03:06] <Valdorick> Teo - "WHO ARE YOU!?" Luna - "I'm you, but stronger this time."
[4:03:12] <+fantom_flasch> Teostra but faster and with bullshit random AOE
[4:03:15] <%Aydarkzero> she's like Teo but w/ agro range the size of the whole map and saps away your health just by being near her LUL
[4:03:15] <%D_day> Luna is nothing compared to Behemoth Kappa
[4:03:17] <Sephrim> Luna is def worse
[4:03:19] <PsychedelicSnake> Yo Pat, if you think Luna is bad now just fucking wait until you see her nova
[4:03:21] <%theslippybrit> why they all look like personas?
[4:03:21] <Tucker0603> I love Lunastra's design and gear, fighting her is a pain
[4:03:22] <danknugglit> Dead
[4:03:22] <PsychedelicSnake> There it goes
[4:03:22] <+applefibs> yeah, i think faster weapons have an easier time with teo, he's easy to cheese if you can stand in the right spot

[4:03:45] <%Tokanova> instead of an explosion, it's a fire

[4:03:59] <ne0bunny> super damage over time nova
[4:03:59] <RevenantJoy> Pat! Wait until Luna and Teo do their combined nova!
[4:04:00] <%trez_> luna inside the arena suuuuuuuucks
[4:04:02] <%ThePuddingDead> @PsychedelicSnake yooo what up snake!
[4:04:04] <+TroyMSW> The DMC event mission in this game is hilarious. If you use the longsword (a big Katana) you get Virgil's theme playing. Sword and shield gets Lock and load with a bunch of cat meows. And, using either bow-gun gets you music from DMC2.
[4:04:04] <+Risingxiv> Yeyeyeye
[4:04:04] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @AngriestPat Use the Glowing Gold Mantle to avoid that bullshit.
[4:04:05] <Hydrapissed> or health augment and HIT her
[4:04:05] <+mmSoTasty> cures all red damage
[4:04:05] <luckysteak> that fireproof mantle is looking minty fresh
[4:04:05] <%TheSniperJoe> Drink your drank and keep that fire resist cloak on.
[4:04:05] <Lolcola34> Hunters cook real good
[4:04:06] <+oreo_0o> dive ftw
[4:04:06] <Daniel_Is_I> It also heals red health
[4:04:08] <Valdorick> It also gives you a HoT
[4:04:09] <@ThePlotHole> Astera Jerky heals back all your red HP
[4:04:09] <+AlphaAgito> It also increases health recovery speed
[4:04:10] <+Camail> double hp regen too
[4:04:12] <Greywolf47> it heal red portion of health
[4:04:12] <%theslippybrit> apply jerky directly to wounds, for the salt!
[4:04:12] <PsychedelicSnake> Astera Jerky heals recoverable damage
[4:04:14] <%Nobrev> it increases natural recovery in general
[4:04:14] <Sephrim> Superman dodge that after the 1st hit and after a 1 second delay
[4:04:15] <$Hiro01231> it up health recovery rate
[4:04:17] <ScreamingMeat> It completely heals red health
[4:04:17] <+Eric_Spells_Rice> minor immunizer

[4:04:55] <PsychedelicSnake> So Pat how are you enjoying the standard Lunastra experience
[4:04:56] <Greywolf47> another secret is if you use water weapon you can put out lunastra's flames
[4:04:57] <luckysteak> Luna has good armor. only good thing to say about it
[4:04:57] <%goose_attack_almanac> Lunastra is a full moon bitch

[4:05:08] <+Vivaciousx3> cool drink and fire mantle
[4:05:08] <Valdorick> Fire resist decos, by the way.
[4:05:10] <Hydrapissed> not even tempred btw
[4:05:10] <Lolcola34> remember the barbecue
[4:05:10] <+ComradePenguin> one tank and three ranged
[4:05:13] <PsychedelicSnake> Yes Pat, it does suck
[4:05:14] <Scorchfield> fireproof mantle is kinda nice to have
[4:05:16] <+applefibs> *laughs in hammer*
[4:05:17] <danknugglit> first time jones
[4:05:17] <+duskerzz> YOU DIED
[4:05:17] <+itsalwayssweaterweather> PC?
[4:05:18] <+Eric_Spells_Rice> lol lunastra is rough with GS
[4:05:18] <+Donutjulio> Like I get that its supposed to be hard but this just seems like bad design
[4:05:18] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Just do the Behemoth stuff
[4:05:20] <%MakotoPB> Aster jerky heals all red dmg. very good with Luna and many other elders
[4:05:22] <Divinity4RAGE> he shouldnt have gotten up immediately
[4:05:22] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat May I recommend my friend, the duel blades!
[4:05:22] <+D2_Synua> Lunastra isn't even bad
[4:05:25] <TripleTRex> hey at least you can fight luna, it still crashes my game
[4:05:25] <Greywolf47> I don't hate her though
[4:05:28] <%TheSniperJoe> I don't hate Behemoth....
[4:05:29] <Hydrapissed> Not even ARCH tempered
[4:05:29] <%brackboi> hes gonna be so salt when he fights behomoth
[4:05:29] <+mmSoTasty> I like Teo and Luna
[4:05:31] <+SuichiTanaka> Astera Jerky makes this fight SO much easier
[4:05:32] <%D_day> 'Strongest'
[4:05:37] <%theslippybrit> pat, wanna borrow my energy?
[4:05:37] <danknugglit> Strongest??!!? AHHAHAHA no pat
[4:05:38] <PsychedelicSnake> @AngriestPat Don't do Behemoth if you hate hearing the same music track over and over for eternity
[4:05:39] <Lolcola34> I think Behemoth is worst
[4:05:41] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat I love her design and gear
[4:05:46] <%RageCasanova> @AngriestPat the glaive helps if you want to cheese it
[4:05:47] <%goose_attack_almanac> Lunastra is super cool. But Incredibly tedious to fight holy shit
[4:05:48] <+GunterDriger6> I happened to do this quest not knowing the terror which would befold on me... NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[4:05:49] <+Rukuojin> I thought Special assignment Luna does do tempered damage
[4:05:49] <fabnanman> shes ok with ranged and gunlance
[4:05:50] <dekkitout> is achip damage spam with a turtle build viable
[4:05:55] <%MakotoPB> fire proof mantle and chill potion
[4:06:02] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat She can also combine her super nova with Teostras for stupid damage
[4:06:03] <%TheSniperJoe> Time to Do BIG BOMBING
[4:06:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Behemothis like fighting Teostra, Lunastra, and Kuhala. and Kirin all at once
[4:06:08] <+mmSoTasty> Behemoth is formulaic. Once you know the fight it's cake. Luna's still hard even when you know the fight
[4:06:09] <Hydrapissed> Fire proof fire res deco fire res food buff
[4:06:10] <TwistedVerse> chill potion.. red bull?
[4:06:15] <Sephrim> I wish that tail of Toster and Luna were just a couple degrees lower. Aside from GS, LS, and SA it's a bitch to hit.
[4:06:18] <Hydrapissed> cool drank
[4:06:21] <Masamune195> Oh man, Lunastra has like some of the best armor skills and slot decorations man~
[4:06:22] <+GunterDriger6> And died exactly like that!
[4:06:28] <nina9669> big fuck
[4:06:28] <Valdorick> They do a mating dance - this kills the party instantly.
[4:06:29] <+mmSoTasty> YEAH it's a bond attack, it's really cool
[4:06:30] <DirtyMiser> look at all those wiggly heads. Your friends got wide area for you my dude
[4:06:31] <PsychedelicSnake> Behemoth isn't bad if you have good squaddies. Otherwise he is a total pain inthe ass.
[4:06:32] <+ComradePenguin> yeah when you fight them together
[4:06:33] <+ComradePenguin> is ridics
[4:06:34] <+mmSoTasty> and deadly
[4:06:35] <Ugato> it's like x cut except it's just fire
[4:06:35] <+fantom_flasch> Basically the whole arena asplode
[4:06:35] <SiegeJay> REMINDER: Devs could not beat EXTREMOTH in playtests
[4:06:37] <Ugato> and death
[4:06:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The have a special reverse turf war
[4:06:38] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat Teostra and Lunastra work together
[4:06:39] <+SuichiTanaka> Yeah, you get an ultra nova
[4:06:40] <Greywolf47> it covers a whole room
[4:06:42] <dekkitout> sounds hot
[4:06:42] <%omegasis> nah, I think kush is worse than teo and luna
[4:06:44] <%MakotoPB> gotta super dive for iframes or run like hell
[4:06:45] <%VanaSkiller> hot fiery death
[4:06:46] <+Camail> DirtyMiser thats a layered armor now too, so maybe not
[4:06:46] <+mmSoTasty> you can drop Luna IMO
[4:06:46] <%RageCasanova> @AngriestPat in her solo fight kushala can show up and mix his tornado with her flames
[4:06:48] <+Risingxiv> Just Farcaster when u see it
[4:06:49] <danknugglit> You should get that temporal mantle before behemoth
[4:06:49] <Lolcola34> Its like a Turf war but with a hug.
[4:06:57] <+MrMcCrabby> hello, what's pat hunting now
[4:06:58] <+mmSoTasty> like, it would be more fun to see Behemoth than Luna
[4:06:58] <Hydrapissed> Normal behe is ez pz chat relax get a tank and a healer and go afk
[4:07:02] <+stelfury> don't flash her unless you really want to bait out a nova. she gets so mad when you flash her
[4:07:03] <PsychedelicSnake> Farm Luna for the temporal mantle and then never again
[4:07:05] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> the best kinds of turf wars end with hugs
[4:07:08] <ScreamingMeat> yes
[4:07:08] <%RageCasanova> @AngriestPat HUGE BLUE FIRE TORNADO
[4:07:09] <%TheSniperJoe> YES
[4:07:09] <DirtyMiser> aw man you right
[4:07:09] <+Camail> yes
[4:07:10] <+D2_Synua> Temporal mantle is game changing
[4:07:11] <Divinity4RAGE> he needs luna. he needs temporal for behemoth
[4:07:12] <Greywolf47> yup
[4:07:13] <danknugglit> 3
[4:07:14] <$SleepyMaribo> eventually yes
[4:07:14] <luckysteak> you get it from the following mission?
[4:07:17] <+Eric_Spells_Rice> 1 more quest after this
[4:07:18] <+SuichiTanaka> Flashing Lunastra guarantees she'll nova
[4:07:21] <+MrMcCrabby> oh lunastra is tough man
[4:07:22] <%Mev852_> I keep hearing Luna has the best armor but I think it sucks.
[4:07:26] <%theslippybrit> cry pat, its not a stream till you cry
[4:07:26] <PsychedelicSnake> Youget the mantle from this questline but not this quest specifically
[4:07:26] <+applefibs> the trick to lunastra is to flash her a lot
[4:07:33] <FruitBasketVidya> @SuperChumps this is the best starting point it is the most accessable
[4:07:33] <+MrMcCrabby> your first few luna hunts are going to be rough
[4:07:37] <%TheSniperJoe> Just Cluster Bomb the hell out of her.
[4:07:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Well I mean theres no way he's doing behemoth on his first try
[4:07:44] <Divinity4RAGE> @mev852_ its good on some weapons
[4:07:46] <Valdorick> What Suichi says is true, never flash Luna, she is a dignified lady, and will not tolerate you exposing your balls before her.
[4:07:46] <+duskerzz> I Would flash Lunastra 100% of the time then ;)
[4:07:47] <+Camail> if you flash her while she's enraged is baits out the nova, otherwise it doesn't
[4:07:50] <+mmSoTasty> @SuperChumps World is the best time to get into Monster Hunter. never been more beginner-friendly
[4:07:53] <%theslippybrit> can u imagine this crazy shit in first person?
[4:07:53] <%DrFacilier> wait did Pat ever fight the Behemoth??
[4:07:55] <+MrMcCrabby> luna armor is good for making mixed sets in general, not good for making big dick meta sets
[4:07:56] <Greywolf47> @Mev852_ the gem slots on luna armor is what makes it great
[4:07:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Temporal mantle or no
[4:08:00] <+AlphaAgito> Greed
[4:08:00] <+Camail> thats temporal
[4:08:00] <PsychedelicSnake> That is temporal
[4:08:01] <+SuichiTanaka> That's Temporal Mantle
[4:08:03] <dekkitout> that might me temporal
[4:08:04] <+mmSoTasty> temporal
[4:08:04] <%camodikk> thats the temporal
[4:08:04] <BakerBrute> That Temporal
[4:08:04] <Masamune195> that's the temporal mantle
[4:08:04] <%VanaSkiller> it aint
[4:08:06] <danknugglit> thats temp
[4:08:06] <%MrBorisMakarov> LUL
[4:08:07] <%trez_> temporal
[4:08:08] <%TheSniperJoe> It's the Temporal Mantle.
[4:08:08] <%MakotoPB> temporal
[4:08:09] <ScreamingMeat> That's the Temporal Mantle
[4:08:09] <+stelfury> thats the temporal mantle Pat
[4:08:09] <%RageCasanova> @AngriestPat thats the temporal mantle
[4:08:09] <+Eric_Spells_Rice> lmao, that's temporal LUL
[4:08:12] <%D_day> LUL
[4:08:12] <PsychedelicSnake> ! BLIND !
[4:08:17] <%Dingus_Tickler> I’m kind of bummed that there was no Resident Evil 2 or Onimusha crossover for this game.
[4:08:18] <%Mev852_> temporal looks just like the temporal
[4:08:19] <+MrMcCrabby> because you dodge the fire
[4:08:20] <Tetsu_TIW> That's the "maybe mantles were fundamentally a bad idea" mantle
[4:08:20] <luckysteak> it is auto-adept style. love it
[4:08:21] <%theslippybrit> tempura oral
[4:08:27] <+applefibs> @Mev852_ true
[4:08:27] <DirtyMiser> temporal is ez dodges till it runs out
[4:08:32] <%RageCasanova> I get that shit mixed up all the time and have died from having bandit saved on old sets
[4:08:40] <+fantom_flasch> Effects are real pretty though
[4:08:41] <%D33TR> lunastra is absolute cancer
[4:08:41] <%Mev852_> ... damn it.
[4:08:42] <Sephrim> @AngriestPat Dont use Flashpods, they dont work
[4:08:43] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat It gives auto dodge with infinite invincibility frames
[4:08:44] <Ugato> what is the moonlight sword looking weapon
[4:08:46] <%Nobrev> she's such a cool looking monster but the fight sucks
[4:08:47] <+mmSoTasty> @AngriestPat IIRC, flash pods can trigger her nova. unless they changed that.
[4:08:49] <+SuichiTanaka> Whelp
[4:08:49] <Tetsu_TIW> HE DID IT
[4:08:50] <%trez_> oh god
[4:08:51] <+AlphaAgito> Oh no
[4:08:52] <Daniel_Is_I> She's immune to flash!
[4:08:52] <%VanaSkiller> OH YEAAAAA
[4:08:53] <%D33TR> oh no
[4:08:53] <%Fruitywhompus> oh no
[4:08:53] <Greywolf47> no he's done it
[4:08:53] <PsychedelicSnake> If I am not mistaken, Lunastra in this mission is actually beefed up compared to her standard counterpart
[4:08:54] <BakerBrute> OH NO
[4:08:54] <%claudesavegely> oh no
[4:08:54] <+MrMcCrabby> LUL
[4:08:54] <%axellogic> PAT NO
[4:08:55] <+SuichiTanaka> GOOD JOB PAT
[4:08:55] <BakerBrute> HERE WE GO
[4:08:56] <danknugglit> Temporal = easy mode
[4:08:56] <Tetsu_TIW> HE DID THE THING
[4:08:57] <$SleepyMaribo> Yep shes immune to flash
[4:08:57] <+Risingxiv> lol
[4:08:58] <luckysteak> running time
[4:08:58] <+Camail> flash is to bait nova
[4:08:58] <$Hiro01231> now she nova
[4:08:58] <%VanaSkiller> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[4:08:58] <%axellogic> DO NOT FLASH HER
[4:08:59] <%Tearonex> It doesn't knock down Pat
[4:08:59] <+mmSoTasty> yeah they didn't change that
[4:08:59] <+ComradePenguin> hhahahaha
[4:08:59] <%trez_> LUL
[4:09:00] <iwishtobetheprincess> flashing luna is bad news bears
[4:09:00] <Valdorick> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NO no no NOOOOO! Never flash Luna!
[4:09:00] <+stelfury> Pat don't flash h e r!
[4:09:01] <+AlphaAgito> flash makes her nova
[4:09:02] <+mmSoTasty> I spoke too soon
[4:09:03] <Sephrim> LETS GO
[4:09:04] <PhoenixPyrrhus> noooo pat
[4:09:05] <+mmSoTasty> *late
[4:09:05] <%Ciphris> W H I F F
[4:09:05] <Daniel_Is_I> It just makes her MAAAD
[4:09:06] <Greywolf47> never flash luna
[4:09:06] <Divinity4RAGE> yea she doesnt drop LUL
[4:09:06] <Hydrapissed> Flash = nova
[4:09:07] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> RUN GET AWAY
[4:09:07] <%MakotoPB> yeah flashing her doesn't make her drop
[4:09:08] <%patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat what isnt this fun, arent you having fun
[4:09:08] <%omegasis> oh no one told him that flashing does an automatic supernova
[4:09:10] <%theslippybrit> dont flash apparently
[4:09:11] <%RageCasanova> @AngriestPat flash pods force her to super
[4:09:14] <+ComradePenguin> yes
[4:09:15] <+ComradePenguin> big bad
[4:09:18] <+Camail> axellogic that was a good time to do it, tbh
[4:09:18] <$SleepyMaribo> Flashing her causes her to go super nova
[4:09:19] <WrendWravyn> Flashing her just makes her angry. Hahahah!
[4:09:20] <VERDAXY> Just drop the t -Virus on it and make it 10 times worst
[4:09:20] <+applefibs> flashing luna forces supernova, which can actually be good
[4:09:21] <%theslippybrit> no flash! all dick! all the time!
[4:09:22] <Cthulos> hey at least she used up her nova
[4:09:23] <+MetalMeltdown31> Flashing Luna is a legit tactic IF you're ready to run for cover.
[4:09:23] <Greywolf47> it triggers supernovs
[4:09:26] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat It's doesn't knock her out of the air
[4:09:29] <%D33TR> not necessarily if you want to make her nova
[4:09:32] <%joylent_blue> its only bad if you aren't prepared for it
[4:09:35] <ScreamingMeat> Drop the rock on her
[4:09:39] <Sephrim> Ya its a mixed bag if everyone doesnt die to the nova
[4:09:46] <%RageCasanova> BEEP THE KITTY
[4:09:49] <+fantom_flasch> Oh yeah, I forgot about this goddamn 15 minute time limit
[4:09:51] <%RageCasanova> HONK THEM TOOTS
[4:10:02] <Ugato> What's that Longsword?
[4:10:02] <+Camail> the only thing i dont like about lunastra is that they removed the forleg weakness
[4:10:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Her super is bullshit but other than that, in general she's easier than teo
[4:10:03] <Cthulos> Beep the Luna
[4:10:05] <%theslippybrit> make her humble!
[4:10:07] <Lolcola34> Giver her the old one two buckle your shoe
[4:10:07] <L_Rance> nova also removes aura when it's gone, right?
[4:10:11] <Cthulos> Honk honk honk
[4:10:16] <Ugato> Is that from Lunastra?
[4:10:25] <PsychedelicSnake> Fireproof + Cool Potion makes Lunastra more tolerable, but she is still goddamn annoying
[4:10:26] <danknugglit> Yea
[4:10:29] <%theslippybrit> ha! bitch got no tail
[4:10:30] <Sephrim> Yes, Nova removes aura
[4:10:34] <+stelfury> @l_rance yeah but she gets it back pretty quick
[4:10:34] <ScreamingMeat> That's the Luna LS on the Xeno branch
[4:10:34] <%Tokanova> oh nice, tail cut
[4:10:34] <+fantom_flasch> I think Teo is pretty easy if you have lots of space, like in Wildspire
[4:10:35] <%joylent_blue> say goodbye to your tail bitch
[4:10:42] <%MakotoPB> fighting Luna is a lot easier solo no palico
[4:10:43] <+SuichiTanaka> For her supernova, as soon as she starts, I put weapon away, eat Astera Jerky, then run away and dive.
[4:10:43] <luckysteak> horns won
[4:10:45] <%theslippybrit> pat likes a woman with a durable face
[4:10:48] <danknugglit> Thats the xeno/luna ls
[4:10:48] <Daniel_Is_I> Don't think you can break horns until she's low
[4:10:49] <+SulfurousAcid> yeyeyeyeye carve
[4:10:52] <%RageCasanova> look at pat giving solid head
[4:10:55] <luckysteak> horns won't break until she is nearly dead
[4:10:59] <ScreamingMeat> Ballsy carve
[4:10:59] <Cthulos> she tried
[4:11:03] <%Tokanova> she gettin mad
[4:11:05] <%SmolBluGhost> lol durable face
[4:11:08] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @theslippybrit then why does he bother hitting the back?
[4:11:10] <nina9669> to bar
[4:11:10] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat Both teo and luna's horns don't break til they're sub 15% life.
[4:11:12] <%Tokanova> you're not pat, you're doing decent damage
[4:11:14] <+MetalMeltdown31> I think you're doing pretty well.
[4:11:14] <dekkitout> it do be like that tho
[4:11:17] <+Camail> everyone gets carried their first time vs lunastra
[4:11:17] <%joylent_blue> thats not true, you've gotten in like..... 4 good hits
[4:11:18] <%Ciphris> wiggle wiggle wiggle
[4:11:18] <%TheSniperJoe> Git Gud then?
[4:11:20] <nina9669> to bad pat
[4:11:21] <+mmSoTasty> Luna is several steps above Teo in difficulty
[4:11:23] <%Chichen> you're doing fine sweetie
[4:11:25] <%Mev852_> you're doing alright.
[4:11:29] <%Tokanova> did pretty good when she fell down at least
[4:11:29] <%theslippybrit> @Youwereeatenbyalid because hes still too cowardly to show himself
[4:11:31] <+Camail> the fast chimeras are tricky to learn
[4:11:32] <+fantom_flasch> You can't handle Lunastra's HOT ZONE
[4:11:34] <%RageCasanova> much quality head
[4:11:36] <Valdorick> You're pulling your weight pretty well. Its just everyone is carried when there's a...w hat's it called... AoE item thingy.
[4:11:39] <+metalsiren31> Honestly I think Lunastra is pretty BS to fight melee. I main bow so it's not a problem for me, but I feel for melee users
[4:11:41] <ScreamingMeat> You don't even kill her here either
[4:11:42] <+applefibs> getting carried through the fight > getting carried back to camp
[4:11:42] <%VanaSkiller> apatBig danny
[4:11:43] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @theslippybrit bold
[4:11:44] <%patriotrenegade> right?
[4:11:50] <%AllyBeeBoo> getting some good hits in is all that matters!
[4:11:53] <PhoenixPyrrhus> great sword is just a tough weapon to use against her
[4:11:53] <%TheSniperJoe> Behemoth is harder than Luna but Luna is WAAAAAAY bigger bullshit.
[4:11:55] <%patriotrenegade> NO ITS FUN
[4:11:58] <%MrBorisMakarov> NAH ITS FINE
[4:11:58] <danknugglit> F
[4:11:59] <%Tokanova> RUN
[4:12:00] <suikudo> LUL

[4:12:12] <$SGrim> @metalsiren31 Ice Dual Blades and Fireproof Mantle. Spams knock-downs.
[4:12:14] <Sephrim> LAY DOWN
[4:12:14] <Valdorick> @AngriestPat to make water weapons useful, they made it to where the blue fire patches can douse the flames.
[4:12:15] <+Risingxiv> at least you dodge behemoth
[4:12:15] <%Tokanova> monkaS
[4:12:15] <+applefibs> sweet tackle though
[4:12:16] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> SO LUCKY
[4:12:16] <%RageCasanova> YEAH!
[4:12:16] <Brutal_Defeat> luna is a terrible fight for melee. i had to switch to bow to beat her after 12 attempts
[4:12:17] <PsychedelicSnake> Big carries
[4:12:17] <Sephrim> DONT GET UP
[4:12:18] <+fantom_flasch> GOOD WORK
[4:12:18] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat The blue fire pits also block range weapons
[4:12:19] <waifoong98> LUL

[4:12:34] <@shinsaryn> @AngriestPat So here's a big meme, that Lunastra is basically a Tempered.
[4:12:34] <+MetalMeltdown31> Nicely done.
[4:12:36] <+MrMcCrabby> @AngriestPat you can dodge her supernova by running into a patch of fire and letting it knock yo udown
[4:12:38] <+Eric_Spells_Rice> spamming superman dive helps avoid the tick dmg
[4:12:38] <luckysteak> get the tail!
[4:12:39] <%Straylightgg> Is there a cooler name for a thing than "DRAGONATOR"?
[4:12:41] <+SuichiTanaka> Carve

[4:12:52] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat her armor set is one of the best in the game though
[4:12:52] <PsychedelicSnake> It's true, Lunastra in this quest is beefed up
[4:12:53] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat You can only get rid of them is to hit them with a water weapon or wait
[4:12:53] <+zaworldo> pat the TAIL
[4:12:53] <ne0bunny> CARVE
[4:12:54] <Sephrim> @AngriestPat If you get knocked down during the nova, you can just stay down to ignore the 2nd wave.
[4:12:55] <Greywolf47> you can put the fire out before the ignite if you have a water weapon
[4:12:55] <+Eric_Spells_Rice> pat got the tail already

[4:13:06] <+metalsiren31> Yeah the good news is that Tempered Luna is basically the same as normal so it doesn't get any worse really

[4:14:07] <+Amplificate> Lunastra has great equipment but Pat can't get them because he has to do like lal the quests, right?
[4:14:07] <%Dingus_Tickler> Behemoth deals stupid amounts of damage. Like 1/2 your health bar levels of stupid.

[4:14:19] <Archmortal> You have to beat Lunastra, not just repel it
[4:14:19] <Sephrim> @mmSoTasty Her weapons are some of THE best.
[4:14:20] <%Plague_Nurse> You have to hunther

[4:14:38] <+TONYOO101> has pat done behemoth/AT behemoth yet?
[4:14:41] <+mmSoTasty> @Sephrim and her gamma set is my new main set, such a great evasion set

[4:14:53] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> GET THE LOCKER THO
[4:14:55] <+Norggron> is my sound messed up or is the music messed up
[4:14:56] <%Nobrev> you didn't really hunt her yet @AngriestPat
[4:14:57] <nina9669> After pat...
[4:14:59] <+Silentman0> did he miss the part where there was one more quest or what
[4:14:59] <%RageCasanova> sometimes getting only one mat isn't enough for it to pop in
[4:15:01] <iwishtobetheprincess> remember to talk to the chief ecologist to add luna for tracking
[4:15:02] <%goose_attack_almanac> Anyone here try that Apex Legends game?
[4:15:03] <%joylent_blue> the pre behemoth quest is a fucking hussle
[4:15:04] <%MakotoPB> ice weapons for Luna. she is not weak to water
[4:15:07] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Locker, Gotta get the Locker
[4:15:08] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat gotta Merc that bitch
[4:15:08] <%Dingus_Tickler> Tbh AT Behemoth looks like the least fun shit in the world and isn’t worth it at all.
[4:15:09] <+Camail> drachen + nerg helm, or gala hat
[4:15:10] <%goose_attack_almanac> Also Lunastra a hoe
[4:15:11] <Sephrim> It should be at the bottom
[4:15:14] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> what the fuck
[4:15:15] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat you have to actually carve her before her weapons show up.
[4:15:18] <%theslippybrit> fuck you its a sign of opulence
[4:15:19] <+timblenaut> alpha looks cool
[4:15:20] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> that's horrendous
[4:15:20] <count_bob> Why is Pat lying?
[4:15:21] <+fantom_flasch> I wish Teo+Luna armor didn't look like such shit
[4:15:22] <%Imperial_Madman> the one with the helmet looks nice...
[4:15:24] <%connos_livereview> orlesian af
[4:15:26] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat its a really good armor set though if you want to be a support
[4:15:27] <ScreamingMeat> a looks cool, b is dog shit
[4:15:27] <+Amplificate> Her pants are so nice
[4:15:28] <Valdorick> @AngriestPat But check out the Palico version!
[4:15:28] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat but her weapons are pretty dang good
[4:15:30] <alwayspronking> But its good support armor. Natural wide range 4 is nice
[4:15:31] <DirtyMiser> I like the G Teo look the best. Got the cape and everything
[4:15:31] <%skizzuto> eh it's not bad except for the helmet
[4:15:32] <nina9669> wide range though
[4:15:33] <Ugato> yeah that looks like ass
[4:15:35] <%Urgotfantasy> I kinda like the alpha one but the beta holy shit
[4:15:35] <+applefibs> the legs are the only good part
[4:15:36] <%omegasis> Teo's G Rank armor looks great tho
[4:15:36] <$Hiro01231> check her weapon
[4:15:36] <danknugglit> Layered armor tho @angriestpat
[4:15:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> All her weapons are the shit tho
[4:15:37] <Tucker0603> I like the alpha set......
[4:15:37] <TheHotStuven> Luna pants are so damn good double 2 slots
[4:15:38] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Looks better than the Female kind. Let me tell you...
[4:15:38] <+Camail> darchen with top hat is meta, but i like nergi
[4:15:38] <+MetalMeltdown31> Luna armor is really potent defensive/support armor.
[4:15:39] <+SulfurousAcid> Pat needs his fashion
[4:15:40] <+mmSoTasty> I like everything but the head pieces
[4:15:42] <+duskerzz> in the universe tho
[4:15:43] <%VanaSkiller> now go kill it
[4:15:52] <MagknO> What? Peak performance with 3 1 slots is amazing
[4:15:54] <iwishtobetheprincess> luna's gear is good for tank builds
[4:15:57] <%Nobrev> @AngriestPat to fing her weapons you go into the regular craft weapon menu
[4:15:58] <danknugglit> Git gud then
[4:16:00] <MagknO> especially if your a bowgun user
[4:16:01] <+Camail> kill AT kirin for a fancy dress
[4:16:03] <Divinity4RAGE> its nuts for sns wide range healers
[4:16:04] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> you don't deserve it yet
[4:16:08] <%claudesavegely> bring poo
[4:16:09] <ScreamingMeat> LUL
[4:16:10] <%joylent_blue> yes because fuck you
[4:16:13] <Nova712> loath this fight...

[4:16:14] <%Tokanova> Poop on em
[4:16:16] <%theslippybrit> yay! salad!
[4:16:16] <+oreo_0o> normal teo n luna, its fine
[4:16:16] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat time to get good.
[4:16:17] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> you haven't felt a sense of pride & accomplishment
[4:16:17] <+orcus12> Wheres the sword and shield Patty?
[4:16:18] <+mmSoTasty> excited for the bond attack?
[4:16:19] <$Hiro01231> don't forget your cool drinks
[4:16:20] <%brackboi> hes so scared
[4:16:20] <PsychedelicSnake> Lunastra is the definition of "because fuck you"
[4:16:22] <$TC_Lagann> here we gooo
[4:16:22] <%Tokanova> poop on em HARD
[4:16:22] <+MrMcCrabby> and there's a special guest!

[4:16:25] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@RageCasanova) (warning)
[4:16:26] <suikudo> It sucks 10x more than you think
[4:16:26] <Greywolf47> time to split up
[4:16:29] <%theslippybrit> poobot
[4:16:30] <+applefibs> doing both reduces both their HP, making this actually easier than a solo luna
[4:16:32] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Lautrek, is that you?
[4:16:32] <PsychedelicSnake> Nergi is your friend
[4:16:32] <ScreamingMeat> Did you restock?
[4:16:33] <+Camail> tip: kill teostra first
[4:16:34] <danknugglit> The layered set for this festival is nice
[4:16:35] <$SleepyMaribo> try ot kill Teo asap
[4:16:35] <iwishtobetheprincess> teo first yes
[4:16:36] <MagknO> Just don't die FeelsWeirdMan
[4:16:37] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat Go for Teo first
[4:16:37] <+Rukuojin> Teo first yeah
[4:16:38] <%VanaSkiller> both at the same time
[4:16:38] <%ThePuddingDead> u wanna seperate em
[4:16:38] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Why are you blue now?
[4:16:38] <%patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat Are we having fun yet?!
[4:16:39] <Nova712> this fight is literally just "fuck you"
[4:16:42] <+SuichiTanaka> Yeah, this is frankly easier
[4:16:43] <%joylent_blue> fling poop at her
[4:16:45] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat abso-fucking-lutely
[4:16:46] <Daniel_Is_I> @AngriestPat Make one angry and kite it to a different zone
[4:16:46] <+MrMcCrabby> ironically, lunastra investigations are easier than this quest
[4:16:48] <nina9669> nergigantie
[4:16:48] <$TC_Lagann> just dont die 4Head
[4:16:49] <%joylent_blue> until she cries
[4:16:49] <Greywolf47> try and split them up if you can as well
[4:16:54] <fruit_pie_the_magician> DUNG BOMBS
[4:16:55] <+Lucid_Kn1ght> poop doesnt work here lol
[4:16:55] <Masamune195> I think the Kush is there to do extra damage for you
[4:16:56] <PsychedelicSnake> Let Nergi wreck their shit
[4:16:59] <MagknO> Pat show buidl
[4:17:02] <+SulfurousAcid> get poo pat
[4:17:02] <%theslippybrit> just do the crossface! become in invisibroo!
[4:17:05] <%brackboi> hit them dont get hit its easy
[4:17:05] <%RageCasanova> cause a divorce and you're sure to win
[4:17:06] <Greywolf47> dung doesn't work as well on elders
[4:17:09] <%Dingus_Tickler> Yeah this quest isn’t that fine. I hope your team carries most of the fight lol
[4:17:12] <JonKhan> That discoball hat makes that cat look like an asshole
[4:17:14] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat You can also let Nerg do shit loads of damage
[4:17:15] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat tag in Nerg for the assist
[4:17:15] <+SuichiTanaka> I wanna see the Lovesplosion. :3c
[4:17:17] <%Dingus_Tickler> Isn’t that fun**
[4:17:17] <Valdorick> Yeah, haha, Kite them until they Megaflare.
[4:17:18] <%joylent_blue> oh yeah poop doesn't work very well
[4:17:30] <+Camail> the super nova separates them
[4:17:30] <Daniel_Is_I> @AngriestPat Enraged monsters will follow you between zones, normal ones won't. So if one's enraged you can lead away
[4:17:32] <danknugglit> Let them fuck
[4:17:35] <PsychedelicSnake> Let Nergi send them straight to hell with his crippler crossface
[4:17:38] <%goose_attack_almanac> Make Lunastra think her mother is right and put doubts into their relationship
[4:17:41] <%Dingus_Tickler> I hate fighting Lunastra
[4:17:42] <%joylent_blue> dude Huntsman why don't YOU take this quest? lazy motherfucker
[4:17:49] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat Also watch out for their Combo Attck
[4:17:50] <+Camail> after the boom, one of them leaves
[4:17:51] <%RageCasanova> lmao
[4:17:56] <dekkitout> ft el gigante from the monster hunter franchise
[4:17:57] <Eilios1> what’s your equipment
[4:17:57] <+MrMcCrabby> Nergi or kushala
[4:17:59] <Ugato> he's actually a super coward
[4:18:01] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Lunastra is a PAAAAAAIIIINNNN
[4:18:01] <%theslippybrit> just like a relationship
[4:18:02] <+SuichiTanaka> Use crystalburst instead of flash pods to knock them out of nova
[4:18:03] <+MrMcCrabby> Pray its not kushala
[4:18:05] <nina9669> have him do couples therapy
[4:18:06] <Greywolf47> nerg can help deal damage to luna
[4:18:06] <+SulfurousAcid> there's so much content I haven't touched because I haven't touched this game in ages
[4:18:08] <+SuichiTanaka> there's a ton of it around
[4:18:13] <Masamune195> inb4 FLAMING TORNADO
[4:18:14] <danknugglit> Kushala<
[4:18:15] <+SaurianCrash> Git Gud Pat
[4:18:15] <+Camail> AngriestPat there's a warning text on screen, like a turf war
[4:18:16] <PsychedelicSnake> Does Pat have 3x vitality jewels?
[4:18:20] <ScreamingMeat> It looks cool at least
[4:18:23] <+RadDuuude> just farcaster
[4:18:26] <%Tokanova> wait nerg shows up on this quest?
[4:18:28] <%Tokanova> thats cool
[4:18:30] <$TC_Lagann> peace out Luna
[4:18:30] <%joylent_blue> having Kushala come in and do a cool 2k dmg and then BAMF away is pretty nice
[4:18:35] <+mmSoTasty> fun times ahead. also yeah, I just farcaster from Luna's nova
[4:18:43] <WrendWravyn> Look... If someone like me can solo AT-Xeno, you can clear this easily. Whoop some ass, Pat.
[4:18:46] <+MrMcCrabby> Yeah but fire tornadoes are not so fun
[4:18:49] <%theslippybrit> can you imagine hunting monster and some asshole just sits down and eats his lunch
[4:18:49] <+Camail> ROAR city

[4:18:55] <Eilios1> @angriestpat what’s your equipment
[4:18:56] <PsychedelicSnake> This is not a great place to fightthem
[4:18:58] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I'd rather fight AT Vaal and Kush 5 times each than do this quest ever again
[4:18:59] <%goose_attack_almanac> I would fucking shit my ass if Grigori showed up in Monster Hunter World somehow. Grigori being the Dragon in Dragon's Dogma

[4:20:33] <Tucker0603> TEO does have the best looking SNS though ...

[4:24:06] <dekkitout> alright, sex nova is a great naem
[4:24:11] <ScreamingMeat> You killed her hunbando
[4:24:12] <Ugato> let me carve up your mate hold on
[4:24:13] <$TC_Lagann> @D4C_Trice im just meme-ing dude LUL
[4:24:14] <danknugglit> Right
[4:24:18] <PsychedelicSnake> Sex Nova is a good name for a band
[4:24:31] <Valdorick> Killed her husband - before sex I might add - and then carved the love her life's corpse infront of her? I expect nothing less from Pat.
[4:24:37] <%joylent_blue> bitch are you fo' reaaaaal
[4:24:42] <Ugato> ma'am
[4:24:43] <%Mev852_> I can't wait to hear about this on the podcast
[4:24:50] <Ugato> I'll be with you in a moment
[4:24:51] <+SulfurousAcid> That's how you assert dominance
[4:24:52] <+applefibs> DO FLASH HER!
[4:24:54] <Ugato> please ma'am
[4:24:56] <%VanaSkiller> iunno maybe you should
[4:24:58] <%Nobrev> remember most of the time sharpening will insta aggro whatever you're fighting
[4:24:58] <+mmSoTasty> flashing can be strategic to get rid of nova
[4:24:59] <nina9669> u can roll out of sharpen btw
[4:24:59] <PsychedelicSnake> Flashing her can be beneficial sometimes
[4:25:07] <$D4C_Trice> @tc_lagann I know, shame that both hammer and GS have one weapon miles better than the rest in their class.
[4:25:08] <danknugglit> Do it LUL
[4:25:08] <Valdorick> It fucks with your muscle memory, doesn't it?
[4:25:09] <MagknO> flashpoding luna monkaSHAKE
[4:25:12] <%joylent_blue> it'll be messy but it might be good
[4:25:15] <TheHotStuven> Half the time though if you flash she will Nova
[4:25:15] <%Nobrev> owo
[4:25:19] <%MrBorisMakarov> rooOWO
[4:25:20] <%joylent_blue> thats what she said
[4:25:22] <%Dapper_Cactuar> all flashpods do is make her mad and cause her to supernova more often
[4:25:24] <HyperBomb21> Stun in World is really bad. It lasts way too long
[4:25:24] <+VektorTroika> FBI owo OPEN
[4:25:27] <+MetalMeltdown31> Flashing is good if the whole team knows it's coming and can take cover while she burns herself out.
[4:25:34] <+stelfury> flashing her doesn't get her out of the air but it does make her super mad
[4:25:37] <+mmSoTasty> that blue flame is awesome-looking
[4:25:37] <Valdorick> OwO posting, in my MonHun? Time for a purging.
[4:25:42] <%Dapper_Cactuar> it's super annoying considering how often she goes airborne
[4:25:46] <nina9669> uwu
[4:25:48] <Greywolf47> if you are fast enough you can flash luna then hit her with a crystal burst
[4:25:51] <Mrbaconator> you mean, FBI owOPEN
[4:25:52] <%VanaSkiller> woopsOwo
[4:25:58] <dekkitout> we should really switch to chris posting
[4:26:03] <$TC_Lagann> @D4C_Trice is that still a problem? i havent played really in the last 4 or so months so i kinda figured they might address that
[4:26:09] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Man i cant wait for the BR mon hunt kappa
[4:26:12] <count_bob> She's a brick...HAOUSE.
[4:26:14] <danknugglit> Luna is a fuck. But she sure is pretty looking
[4:26:15] <+FattimusSlime> She grew her tail back from last time
[4:26:21] <%joylent_blue> bitch get back here!
[4:26:21] <+DrTribal> Hey what platform is Pat playing on?
[4:26:26] <dezik45> Pat gonna try God Eater 3?

[4:26:28] <%Tearonex> She's the Empress for a reason
[4:26:29] <Ion_LaserX> pc
[4:26:33] <%Dapper_Cactuar> looks like they finally fixed the gitchy hitbox of her tail attack
[4:26:38] <InkyDraconian> I love a woman that can kick my ass
[4:26:40] <+DrTribal> Cool
[4:26:40] <PsychedelicSnake> When is Nergi gonna smash
[4:26:42] <Ugato> that's a good trick
[4:26:44] <$D4C_Trice> @tc_lagann wyvern ignition and Diablos Shattered are still the best
[4:26:49] <Manderfuzz> Switch
[4:26:50] <Valdorick> Well, I'd figure Elder Dragons are lizards, so it makes sense she'd have her tail back.
[4:26:52] <+SulfurousAcid> It's ble
[4:26:53] <+mmSoTasty> only 2 EDs at a time, right?
[4:26:54] <+SulfurousAcid> *blue
[4:26:59] <+Camail> blurple
[4:27:00] <%goose_attack_almanac> I'm having a problem. I'm really sad Titanfall 3 isn't a thing. But also Apex Legends is a good game that I can't complain about save for it not being Titanfall 3
[4:27:05] <Greywolf47> Elder dragon is just a title
[4:27:05] <%joylent_blue> its gamecube color
[4:27:06] <+duskerzz> >god eater
[4:27:08] <MagknO> Didn't PC get Taroth sleep hammer?
[4:27:10] <PsychedelicSnake> Is the Lunastra blue or purple Kappa
[4:27:10] <MagknO> 🤔
[4:27:14] <dekkitout> nergi = goku, pat = krillin, plug in the frieza shaped x-variable as luna
[4:27:20] <danknugglit> I love lunas design but fighting her NotLikeThis
[4:27:21] <$D4C_Trice> @tc_lagann it's that non element boost on the big number my dude.
[4:27:21] <%VanaSkiller> LUL
[4:27:23] <+ahegotrigger> I like that pat has the same weapon preference that I do
[4:27:24] <%theslippybrit> why capture monsters?
[4:27:24] <nina9669> is goe eater good?
[4:27:26] <Valdorick> Elder Dragon may just be a "we don't know what this is" title, but she does have scales.
[4:27:28] <Ugato> she just wants to play
[4:27:38] <$TC_Lagann> @D4C_Trice im thinking of diving back into the game, i guess Wyvern Ignition will still be Ol' reliable
[4:27:40] <%VanaSkiller> denied
[4:27:41] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Thats a fair thing to be sad about rip tf3
[4:27:42] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @goose_attack_almanac it's not really a problem then. Rumour had it that the studio wanted to change engines for Titanfall 3, hence this games existence. Also Apex is really goddamn good
[4:27:43] <Greywolf47> true
[4:27:50] <%TheSniperJoe> It's worth it, that mantle is key to doing any AT Elders.
[4:27:51] <%joylent_blue> theslippybrit more rewards generally, and its easier
[4:27:55] <+mmSoTasty> capturing monsters makes the fight shorter and I don't think there's any change in material gains
[4:27:56] <Kghaleon> oh shit, Pat is still streaming
[4:28:06] <%Dapper_Cactuar> lunastra is sentient cancer with blue fur in MHW in my opinion
[4:28:08] <%theslippybrit> @joylent_blue they not companions?
[4:28:10] <+SulfurousAcid> get er under the pillers
[4:28:18] <+SuichiTanaka> yes
[4:28:20] <TheHotStuven> Yeah
[4:28:21] <%Nobrev> yup

[4:28:29] <SeventyForce> She's in HEAT
[4:28:30] <Valdorick> Blue fire is hotter than red fire, after all.
[4:28:32] <danknugglit> Rude
[4:28:33] <+reaped_psyche> She has a flame shroud effect like Smelter Demon.
[4:28:35] <+duskerzz> AY YO IM DRINKIN HERE

[4:28:44] <%TheSniperJoe> GET THAT TAIL
[4:28:46] <+RadDuuude> I don't find Lunastra that hard anymore tbh
[4:28:46] <%goose_attack_almanac> @The_Lady_Alustriel Yeah. It's been confirmed that they want to make more games within the titanfall universe. And are going to do so. But yeah it's legitimately good. Just comes with a sour background
[4:28:48] <$D4C_Trice> @tc_lagann yep. different armour will help like the dracken legs and the gamma Kulve Tarroth chest
[4:28:52] <Ugato> good head smack
[4:28:53] <+mmSoTasty> @theslippybrit you can catch little animals as pets, and you've always got a cat friend
[4:28:53] <%AncelDeLambert> Fuck monsters giving you a bump then IGNORING YOU because you dared drink
[4:28:54] <%NME_Dom> you should at least start behemoth, because its like this quest line
[4:29:03] <+applefibs> fuck yes that is a cool sliding attack
[4:29:05] <%NME_Dom> and you have to fight bird
[4:29:06] <%theslippybrit> but thats boring i want sick cat dragons
[4:29:09] <Valdorick> Yeah, get Luna's "tail" Kappa
[4:29:10] <+Camail> stole your mount!
[4:29:14] <%NME_Dom> bird with new rock
[4:29:15] <%VanaSkiller> woopsOwo
[4:29:17] <PsychedelicSnake> @goose_attack_almanac I feel they should have annoinced the premium titanfall vs battle royale titanfall before they announced Apex

[4:30:21] <%goose_attack_almanac> @PsychedelicSnake Probab;y announced Apex first because it was 100% done and just needed the press release. And also to test the waters for further announcements. You never know what's going to happen
[4:30:21] <%joylent_blue> THIS IS FINE
[4:30:22] <danknugglit> Dive
[4:30:22] <MagknO> Superman dive!
[4:30:24] <%Tokanova> i like how the other two flew away lmao
[4:30:25] <nina9669> heal
[4:30:26] <%AncelDeLambert> he wanted the sleep and he FUCKED IT
[4:30:27] <BakerBrute> LUL
[4:30:28] <IminyourBase> that far
[4:30:28] <$SleepyMaribo> Real far
[4:30:28] <Greywolf47> Far
[4:30:29] <+reaped_psyche> Real fucking far
[4:30:29] <$D4C_Trice> @tc_lagann you on PC or console?
[4:30:31] <+mmSoTasty> far!
[4:30:32] <nina9669> whole zon3
[4:30:32] <Nova712> basically the entire current zone
[4:30:33] <%Tokanova> FOREVER
[4:30:36] <TheHotStuven> Almost killed Fran LUL
[4:30:36] <Ugato> "enough"
[4:30:37] <Greywolf47> covers almost a room
[4:30:39] <+mmSoTasty> get in another room far
[4:30:41] <Punisher7771> really the 0W0
[4:30:43] <NoctisLucisCaelum15> how far does it go? far enough to fuck you
[4:30:45] <Valdorick> @AngriestPat If you think that's far, the Megaflare Bond attack is 3 times the size... at the damage of Teo's nova.
[4:30:46] <MalignantUpper> might have been worth
[4:30:48] <%Dapper_Cactuar> with how annoying they made her in this game, I dread what Tigrex would be like if they added him, especially considering how they make monsters in this game roar a LOT
[4:30:48] <danknugglit> Dive is the only safe way out
[4:30:49] <$TC_Lagann> @D4C_Trice Console, Xbone unfortunately
[4:30:51] <+applefibs> quick FLASH HER
[4:30:52] <MalignantUpper> nevermind she running again
[4:30:56] <+reaped_psyche> She has a flame shroud effect like Smelter Demon.
[4:30:59] <Nova712> lol
[4:31:00] <GranolaNinja> Is the lobby open?
[4:31:04] <%Tokanova> imagine if he did it again lol
[4:31:06] <%AncelDeLambert> Smelter Cat
[4:31:07] <%NME_Dom> sleep bomb time
[4:31:08] <Greywolf47> crystal bursting her stops her nova
[4:31:09] <Nova712> @GranolaNinja sub only
[4:31:09] <MagknO> Tigrex is coming
[4:31:12] <GranolaNinja> Gotcha
[4:31:13] <%theslippybrit> what is this vanquish shit?
[4:31:17] <nina9669> do is again pat
[4:31:19] <+reaped_psyche> Smelter Cat Dragon
[4:31:20] <GranolaNinja> Makes sense
[4:31:22] <%Nobrev> @GranolaNinja subs only
[4:31:25] <%joylent_blue> she loves the lava
[4:31:31] <Greywolf47> I thought it was narcuga
[4:31:31] <+mmSoTasty> she loves it
[4:31:31] <%Tokanova> she eats the lava
[4:31:31] <$D4C_Trice> @tc_lagann I am on PS4 so I can recommend stuff that is available unlike the pc version
[4:31:36] <%VanaSkiller> heat the lava
[4:31:41] <PsychedelicSnake> Lol trying to capture
[4:31:44] <Nova712> well that's some sloppy bombs
[4:31:45] <MagknO> Yeah but if they have the skeleton for one we're getting all three
[4:31:46] <SplatterAte> Featuring Dante from the Devil may Cry series
[4:31:52] <+stelfury> MY EYES
[4:31:54] <Ugato> face busted
[4:31:57] <%Tokanova> shoulda let the gunlancer do his thing
[4:32:00] <%joylent_blue> pat can't fail it if he doesn't try
[4:32:04] <+VektorTroika> explosive
[4:32:04] <%theslippybrit> if you wanna capture dont wake her up just put a net on that bitch
[4:32:04] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @goose_attack_almanac I'm not sure I share your sentiment. I liked Titanfall 2 a whole lot but Respawn was already incredibly busy with their Star Wars game. I never assumed Titanfall 3 was in development
[4:32:08] <Run44forrest> i dont know anything about monster hunter. this looks really anxiety inducing
[4:32:10] <+mmSoTasty> GS does better wakeup damage than GL
[4:32:15] <Ugato> yeah wyvern fire is good for bomb sploding
[4:32:18] <+mmSoTasty> speaking as an avid gunlancer
[4:32:18] <Nova712> nice
[4:32:19] <Ugato> not on charge 1
[4:32:20] <Greywolf47> possibility but I'll hold my hype for when it's announced
[4:32:21] <+Camail> that timing
[4:32:21] <%VanaSkiller> wham bam
[4:32:22] <Vigonept> only true charge nah?
[4:32:22] <ltbabylucien> Yay!
[4:32:22] <asurafb6> can't capture elders @theslippybrit
[4:32:22] <+reaped_psyche> Nice kill shot
[4:32:22] <+SuichiTanaka> Every fight in Monster Hunter is like a tiny MMO raid
[4:32:23] <alwayspronking> GOTTEEEEm
[4:32:24] <MagknO> EZ Clap
[4:32:24] <nina9669> F
[4:32:24] <Manderfuzz> BOOM headshot!
[4:32:24] <TheHotStuven> She turned for that PogChamp
[4:32:26] <Tucker0603> NIOCE!
[4:32:27] <%Tearonex> nice hit
[4:32:29] <JonKhan> last hiy boise
[4:32:29] <$TC_Lagann> @D4C_Trice sweet, id appreciate it
[4:32:35] <%theslippybrit> boo elders
[4:32:38] <Greywolf47> I would love to see branchydios
[4:32:38] <ScreamingMeat> You're just lucky yoy didn't get hit with the Sex Nova
[4:32:40] <danknugglit> Good job pat
[4:32:40] <+SulfurousAcid> feenBless
[4:32:41] <%calvarok> also titanfall 2 was a huge failure. apex might br thr only thing that gets it out
[4:32:43] <Valdorick> Never a Gem.
[4:32:44] <+stelfury> @theslippybrit she's an elder dragon. you can't capture her right or have i been doing things terribly wrong?
[4:32:49] <$SleepyMaribo> you can just make her gem
[4:32:49] <%joylent_blue> you wish, you gotta WORK for your Luna gems
[4:32:50] <TheHotStuven> Lunastra shiny drops can actually be gems too
[4:32:51] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Also yeh
[4:32:53] <+mmSoTasty> Once I got 4 gems from one AT Luna!
[4:32:54] <+reaped_psyche> The sex nova is too stronk
[4:32:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> TRY THE QUEST BEFORE BEHeMOTH its actually fun
[4:32:55] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> I want Respawn to make money
[4:32:56] <Greywolf47> no elder dragons can't be captured
[4:32:56] <%VanaSkiller> you know MH works on a want system
[4:32:57] <%theslippybrit> i dunno how to monster hunter even
[4:32:57] <Ugato> you can't capture her
[4:33:00] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> and Apex is fantastic
[4:33:01] <+Camail> its not even a sword
[4:33:01] <Vigonept> apex is good tho
[4:33:02] <Valdorick> NOW DO IT AGAIN! (anti-poobot text)
[4:33:03] <+mmSoTasty> don't need to be sharp
[4:33:04] <%greenhathero> nah
[4:33:09] <dekkitout> define "sharp"
[4:33:10] <+ahegotrigger> that corner looks sharp
[4:33:10] <+mmSoTasty> big smash
[4:33:11] <nina9669> big blunt
[4:33:11] <Nova712> with that mass, you don't need to be
[4:33:11] <%goose_attack_almanac> @The_Lady_Alustriel Neither did I. That's just the thing though. All the news around it and people reporting different things make it murky. Also I'm excited for that Star Wars. I have no idea what it's going to be about or include. But I'm excited
[4:33:11] <%Nobrev> titanfall 2 was only a failure because activision actively sabotaged its launch
[4:33:15] <Ugato> making that thing sharp would just make it easier to crack
[4:33:15] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat Well niether are the hammer but...
[4:33:17] <%Tokanova> s harp? what is this... sharp you speak of?
[4:33:18] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat yeah, but their heavy CarlSmile
[4:33:19] <%TheSniperJoe> It would cut you in half if it was swung, it's sharp enough.
[4:33:19] <%ThePuddingDead> that went EXTREMELY well
[4:33:22] <+duskerzz> @AngriestPat 👀
[4:33:24] <OotsyMahDootsie> far too big to be called a sword Kappa
[4:33:24] <PsychedelicSnake> I dunno about you pat but if I get hit with a blunt object the size of a small car it would hurt pretty good
[4:33:25] <ltbabylucien> Touch the Elmo
[4:33:25] <%ThePuddingDead> nj
[4:33:26] <%omegasis> who needs to be sharp, when you're ROCKET-POWERED
[4:33:26] <VritraReiRei> Great Club
[4:33:27] <Ugato> it's just a weird hammer
[4:33:28] <+mmSoTasty> good job

[4:34:23] <%theslippybrit> so when is apex stream?
[4:34:25] <danknugglit> Trying to compete with cod LUL
[4:34:27] <+Nomicro4u> Remember when EA told people not to buy Battlefield 5
[4:34:28] <$TC_Lagann> now we get this free to play BR that is TOTALLY an unsaturated market
[4:34:28] <Greywolf47> now you can get ultra instinct mantle
[4:34:30] <+stelfury> apex is genuinely fun
[4:34:36] <iwishtobetheprincess> remember to talk to the chief ecologist to add luna to the tracking guide
[4:34:37] <%theslippybrit> who is this fucking elf goober?
[4:34:41] <%Dapper_Cactuar> at least it isn't as bad as the time Max got 3 gems in one hunt
[4:34:42] <%Kduff89> Im just gonna put it out there. Hate me all you want. I hate BR. Apex is really fun
[4:34:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> Apex is actually good.
[4:34:46] <Greywolf47> Apex monsters can die
[4:34:47] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @TC_Lagann It's a genuinely fantastic iteration
[4:34:50] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> don't act like it's not
[4:35:01] <%theslippybrit> i wish this game was super violent and brutal
[4:35:05] <%calvarok> yeah apex owns
[4:35:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> THE NEXT QUEST ISN'T BEHEMOTH it's actually fun
[4:35:08] <TheHotStuven> Best mantle

[4:35:31] <TheHotStuven> 90 seconds of god mode PogChamp
[4:35:34] <$D4C_Trice> @tc_lagann Nergigante head b for max might 2, Kulve Tarroth gamma chest for Handicraft 2 and agitator 1, Gala gloves for max might 1, Nergigante waist for attack 2 and Dracken legs for attack 2 and crit boost 1. need a bunch of weakness exploit to slot in and expert decorations. handicraft necklace too helps. thinks that's it and if there is more I can PM you.
[4:35:35] <+RadDuuude> put that shit on and never take it off
[4:35:35] <%theslippybrit> temporal mantle makes you look like trashbag man
[4:35:38] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @TC_Lagann but you never were getting a Titanfall 3 any time son regardless
[4:35:38] <%joylent_blue> oh 90 secs
[4:35:41] <ScreamingMeat> TM is the best mantle alongside Rocksteady
[4:35:42] <danknugglit> Leave jiren to pat
[4:35:46] <%VanaSkiller> pat schlepy?
[4:35:46] <Nova712> at least check out the gear

[4:35:52] <Nova712> doh
[4:35:57] <Valdorick> One time I don't put my (anti-poobot)...
[4:35:58] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Is there any monster from other capcom/other properties you would be super hyped about seeing in MHW? Personally, anything from Dragon's Dogma would make me giddy.
[4:36:00] <%Skeletorexplains> wah
[4:36:04] <%Kduff89> that game was actually fun and I am sad it died
[4:36:04] <%Dapper_Cactuar> greatest jagras leaves on the 7th
[4:36:05] <nina9669> good luck 2with that
[4:36:07] <+Camail> drachen and teostra gamma are meta because of the set bonus
[4:36:08] <valachi> Man I hope Tigrex and Zinogre shows up in Iceborne
[4:36:10] <PsychedelicSnake> Just a warning Pat, make sure you complete Behemoth in one go otherwise you will have to deal with repeating music forever
[4:36:12] <%axellogic> Lunastra ruined pat

[4:36:23] <%Skeletorexplains> dragon dragon fight the dragon dragon ball Z
[4:36:24] <+PenmanLupine> @TC_Lagann at this point, even if you were gonna get Titanfall 3, don't hope for any kind of gam that you'd want. Considering they ripped out all of the movement to make the game more accessible to people with lower skill, and its working, Titanfall 3 is not gonna be anywhere near what Titanfall 2 was.
[4:36:27] <danknugglit> PogChamp PogChamp
[4:36:30] <$TC_Lagann> @The_Lady_Alustriel could've, but now its hard confirmed so sadness intensifies

[4:37:09] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Pat, the assassin's creed quest is an easy way to farm Luna since she has drastically reduced health

[4:37:16] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @TC_Lagann Yeah I mean I had hoped it was being developed, but it's rather unreasonable considering they have another full-scale AAA project in the works. Still I understand
[4:37:19] <+Shastafield> LUL
[4:37:21] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat They have a good point
[4:37:22] <%goose_attack_almanac> @PenmanLupine The movement was reduced because it's not Titanfall. It's in the universe but your characters are specifically not Pilots.Who are the crazy people who do all the movement stuff

[4:38:23] <Valdorick> Alright chat - Retail vs Selling Drugs
[4:38:23] <%Skeletorexplains> i believe
[4:38:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I used to work for Walmart. Never again.
[4:38:34] <danknugglit> Stay in drugs dont do retail
[4:38:35] <+SulfurousAcid> selling drugs
[4:38:36] <%trez_> if you dont play perosona on stream ill unsub and send you back to retail LUL
[4:38:39] <Run44forrest> retail workers are braver than the troops
[4:38:40] <MagknO> Do you the wallworld cheer
[4:38:46] <%goose_attack_almanac> I got a shopping cart rammed into the side of my knee, my manager saw it happen and then complained to me that I was moving slowly. I had a fuckin limp.
[4:38:48] <%theslippybrit> selling drugs - cus of all the free sex
[4:38:51] <%Skeletorexplains> Pat do a cry
[4:38:54] <Valdorick> And I'm not cushy suburban drug selling, I'm talking Pimps and Deals threatening your life daily.
[4:38:58] <%Nobrev> @goose_attack_almanac I think it would be cool if somewhere down the line apex legends adds jack and bt as a legend where jack gets advanced movement instead of an ability and his ult is calling bt down using the titanfall as an attack
[4:39:00] <+VeINoIVI> !uptime
[4:39:00] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 39m.
[4:39:03] <%awsomesaucekirby> I ms painted Elmo's head onto Greatest Chungras. Enjoy it
[4:39:14] <%arfafax> About 78 people to thank still Wowee
[4:39:18] <$TC_Lagann> @D4C_Trice copy and pasted, Thanks My dude
[4:39:19] <+PenmanLupine> @goose_attack_almanac which is another way of saying "we need to dumb this game down as much as possible for the masses, not the people that appreciated a unique experience"
[4:39:29] <$D4C_Trice> @valachi this on the usb drive or did he do it in person?
[4:39:29] <%Kilagn> hey thats me
[4:39:30] <%Dapper_Cactuar> trying to get Jho scalps and Vaal fangs has worn away at my sanity. I've gotten more of both monsters gems than scalps and Vall fangs
[4:39:33] <Valdorick> See, its a trick question - because if you're selling drugs, you're still in retail Kappa
[4:39:33] <%Dapper_Cactuar> vaal*
[4:39:38] <+mmSoTasty> everyone keeps saying apex and my mind always goes to 4U endgame. but no it's BR
[4:39:42] <%ThePuddingDead> Greatest Chungus
[4:39:47] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> thanks Jim
[4:39:57] <%awsomesaucekirby> Chungledy Bumgledy
[4:39:59] <Alseid> Are multiple Chungus called Chungii?
[4:40:00] <+mmSoTasty> fangs are the worst
[4:40:06] <%NWR_James> Brain fungus in his chungus
[4:40:21] <+mmSoTasty> at least with gems you expect them to not drop
[4:40:22] <%goose_attack_almanac> @PenmanLupine Needs to be accessible. That's really understandable. I loved the movement in Titanfall 2 . It's the best FPS I've ever played. But I completely understand why it's not in the BR game
[4:40:23] <%joylent_blue> man FUCK fangs

[4:41:20] <sdgundum990> we on break or is the stream ending?
[4:41:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I have TWO attack decos

[4:41:34] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @goose_attack_almanac when the rumours of a Titanfall BR were going around I wanted a highly vertical map with buildings, wallrunning, and titans. I fully realize that would be bad, but man would that be fun
[4:41:38] <sdgundum990> Thanks!
[4:41:44] <+mmSoTasty> I duped my first attack jewel until I had 7 back when duping was a thing and I have no regrets
[4:42:04] <%joylent_blue> i hate that name now because of what it represents

[4:42:24] <%theslippybrit> so are you gonna sub pat?
[4:42:30] <%Chichen> If that's true you should make some alt accounts and start subbing to yourself
[4:42:31] <%omegasis> Using a palico to collect materials is essentially monhun world style
[4:42:36] <%MrBorisMakarov> chicken sandwhiches are great
[4:42:36] <%arfafax> 50 more apatJpeg
[4:42:42] <%ThePuddingDead> grilled are the best
[4:42:44] <%omegasis> well prowler but same thing
[4:42:51] <+mmSoTasty> @D4C_Trice all these horror stories reinforce my confidence in my choices
[4:42:52] <Valdorick> Pat is like, the Portrait of Doren Grey, but instead of him getting older in return for us not aging, he gets shorter so we can get taller.
[4:42:52] <%connos_livereview> order a chicken sandwich ?
[4:42:54] <enlightenedcorgi> I remember the claw on PSP.
[4:42:56] <%theslippybrit> order a chicken sub... u get it?
[4:42:56] <%awsomesaucekirby> @omegasis is this a [STARFORCE] reference?
[4:43:05] <Run44forrest> order? isnt it like 3 am over there?
[4:43:07] <%NWR_James> Open a window
[4:43:09] <%joylent_blue> we could all be cooler, except emlo
[4:43:18] <$D4C_Trice> pickaxes taking up inventory space, I refuse to go back to that.

[4:44:22] <+PenmanLupine> @goose_attack_almanac I'm sure respawn appreciates your understanding, but its severely disappointing that reducing mobility and severely kneecapping the skill requirement is what is needed to make a game popular.

[4:49:42] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I hope Anthem doesn't cause Bioware's death and we get Dragon Age 4
[4:49:52] <%MrBorisMakarov> okay that makes sense thanks pat
[4:49:52] <ScreamingMeat> I am still salty about Scalebound. It looked so good
[4:49:58] <%connos_livereview> GREAT NOW IM ANGRY ABOUT SCALEBOUND AGAIn
[4:50:00] <%ThePuddingDead> I think EA is death enough for all it's IPs
[4:50:00] <%Straylightgg> tinfoil: EA didn't market TF2 so they could buy Respawn for cheaper
[4:50:03] <LiquidMathew> Bioware will probably survive to see DA4, the brand name still carries worth with that IP
[4:50:10] <%Chichen> But other crack takes its place!
[4:50:12] <%awsomesaucekirby> Pat says do crack
[4:50:14] <%joylent_blue> the soul of Scalebound man lives on in Nero now
[4:50:15] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> it would be really embarrassing if they killed Bioware after they soft-announced Dragon Age

[4:55:40] <%sshen> @mmsotasty stories actually focuses on riders that raise them from eggs instead of hunting them and its more of a turn based rpg
[4:55:52] <%awsomesaucekirby> I made the jojo stone masks in dnd, balanced it, submitted it on the homebrew page of the official site. Got approved.
[4:56:02] <%Dapper_Cactuar> for some reason they thought making the immensely evil and violent living suit of armor the party lead was a good idea
[4:56:06] <+Nomicro4u> good
[4:56:11] <+mmSoTasty> @sshen oh, yeah, I beat it. but you still kill monsters.
