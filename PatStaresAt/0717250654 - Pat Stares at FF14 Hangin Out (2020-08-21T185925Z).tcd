[0:32:18] <sheepysenka> monk master race

[0:32:21] <%LaughingCatt> Samurai & Dragoon & Ninja are all good
[0:32:21] <%the22cstomp> very bad
[0:32:22] <BluBox> They are good in all raid scenes! Battle Litany baby!
[0:32:22] <%marsantas> Monk is great, it just needs more
[0:32:22] <%nimu290> but I like the heals
[0:32:23] <@CreepyPorpoise> Don't listen to Pat, he doesn't even play monk
[0:32:24] <%LaughingCatt> Monk exists
[0:32:24] <+SpectrumSpy> Flips
[0:32:24] <MattyValor> monk is fun tho
[0:32:24] <%Kyoshikei> dont play monk until 5.4
[0:32:25] <vVAstrAVv> ninja does a naruto run
[0:32:25] <+aphotophilic> theyre good at yeeting themselves off the mortal coil
[0:32:25] <%SpcOpsBear> SpcOpsBear subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Fun fact: the actual term for "monster fucker" is "teratophile". Now we know what to REALLY call Plague and people who play Hrothgar or Lalafels.
[0:32:26] <skyheys> Ninja good
[0:32:26] <ShepardUA> how do you cope with a shitty AA and foliage shimmering? @PatStaresAt
[0:32:26] <@SoFarFetched> @SirKeigan think he means he sees them chatting in here.
[0:32:27] <%AngelCrossroads> Monk is soooo op
[0:32:29] <Jdrockefeller> it's not bad but it's alot of effort
[0:32:29] <@SSaryn> If you like press button cause you're a SMN and I know you press lots of button, NIN is basically perfect right now.
[0:32:31] <Snookasaurus> Monk is awful in WoW too
[0:32:32] <+xeros720> and that's pat
[0:32:33] <Focant> I feel like Monk is always struggling :(
[0:32:33] <+miguelrod777> They have
[0:32:33] <+HelloImTom08> why play monk, when you could just play Sam LUL
[0:32:33] <heartlesshealer> they're trying to super overhaul monk later if I remember correctly
[0:32:36] <%MisterTylerrr> Samurai is dope
[0:32:36] <Heatonist> i like monk
[0:32:36] <$metzselaar> Monk is good
[0:32:36] <+k7991> By the time you max monk it'll be fixed in 5.4
[0:32:37] <+derivedknight> Been playing Monk since Heavensward Pat. You can't stop my Inssnity

[0:32:42] <ShepardUA> агсл
[0:32:43] <NemokillerV> Monk is OK but they it's kind of a mess
[0:32:43] <%OGTacoTuesday> Can you explain your general hatred for lalafell
[0:32:45] <%AlteisenReiseZ> IM PLAYING MONK RIGHT NOW FUCK OFF
[0:32:45] <%Typhaeon> Had to throw in a foilage
[0:32:47] <%penitentpentwitch> Monk still needs the overhaul, but at least the QoL with this patch is nice
[0:32:48] <+UberWolfman> Monk is op says one guy
[0:32:50] <%MisterTylerrr> It's not made to be run in 4k, bam
[0:32:51] <Jdrockefeller> and they are looking to make big changes to make it more manageable
[0:32:55] <%Nobrev> Dragoon is cool but the timer on the job gauge makes me feel icky so I use samurai for my melee dps
[0:32:57] <+LittleBigQuebec> @DappercatEsquire Scathe, Blizzard 2
[0:33:00] <ManfredA> @RyTYoung yeah SMN is the hardest class in the game, sorry mang

[0:36:35] <%Aleate> Red Mage Gang
[0:36:36] <KoyaMusa> i hate that blm's low level rotation changes every like 4 levels
[0:36:38] <%Fadedblank247> yeah low lvl BLM play is boring as fuck
[0:36:38] <+Yakobro> pre 72 is ass
[0:36:41] <Flakari> It's a Fire I fest
[0:36:41] <@SSaryn> I'd debate BLM is worse than DRG leveling them up.
[0:36:42] <RogueMinja> Man, my chocobo is only at rank 7.
[0:36:42] <+LittleBigQuebec> yea i'm black mage main and it does indeed sucks at low level
[0:36:44] <Isord> Why?
[0:36:44] <bbHighvalor> I mean all low levels jobs are boring as hell
[0:36:46] <ASleepySnek> aoe is shit till 68 to
[0:36:46] <Bamcrash> Monk though
[0:36:47] <%Shockrates20XX> I don't like SMN because it doesn't fit my idea of the FF Summoner class fantasy.
[0:36:50] <%VashyronM> It is unpleasant till fire 4
[0:36:53] <%penitentpentwitch> Taking BLM to Praetorium is pain
[0:36:54] <+EvilSoully> PLAY DRAGOOOOOOOON
[0:36:55] <%BIumen> as a black mage player i agree
[0:36:56] <ASleepySnek> and waiting for mana tick until 72
[0:36:57] <RushUnplugged> Can't believe Pat would recommend THE badplayers class, DRG, and then badmouth BLM
[0:37:02] <%MisterTylerrr> @Bamcrash Monk is fun, it just sucks
[0:37:04] <%Starotter70> I already am
[0:37:07] <+HelloImTom08> they should have them learn fire 4 at lvl 50
[0:37:07] <+Yakobro> @Bamcrash monk is fine once you get form shift
[0:37:10] <KoyaMusa> haha no aesthete gear
[0:37:10] <heartlesshealer> nice
[0:37:12] <%RyTYoung> oh god
[0:37:13] <%Typhaeon> Pfff
[0:37:13] <%Valdorick> Valdorick subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Wow, one year and on my birthday too! How coincidental! I recently started playing FF14 again, and am currently a blackmage. I hate it, hope I hit 60 soon... else I'll keep crafting and ignoring the MSQ!
[0:37:17] <%Jekado> good to see yokai waits is good and stonk these days
[0:37:19] <%weissguard> woah
[0:37:24] <shintenseicoma> I didn't think Pat did the yokai event lol
[0:37:28] <tetriata> Lancer could be argued as worse than low level BLM
[0:37:29] <alwaysneedcaffiene> omnicrafter pat.
[0:37:32] <%Typhaeon> Where's your aesthete pentamelds nerd
[0:37:32] <$metzselaar> Nice!
[0:37:32] <Finaldragoon> slacking on that Culinarian desynth, go fishing
[0:37:33] <DawnsRoyal> has pat already done the 5.3 story?
[0:37:36] <@CreepyPorpoise> So Desynth is why you stole all of the weapons out of Hades and Ruby
[0:37:37] <+HelloImTom08> pat showing off how much if a psycho he is with his dysynth lvl
[0:37:39] <%BinaryFireball> blue mage works for ubisoft

[0:37:40] <%Kyoshikei> IM WORKING ON GATHERING/CRAFTING!! ;D
[0:37:41] <DougintheTrench> I blame you Pat @PatStaresAt I started playing last week and I'm now level 50 in the gathering classes, level 30 in the crafting, and I'm only level 20 in Dragoon and yet to get a Grand Company @PatStaresAt How could you have gotten me into such a good game?
[0:37:44] <bbHighvalor> Delete Blu mage
[0:37:46] <+EvilSoully> Blue Mage is for ew

[0:37:51] <%thegreatbambe> @PatStaresAt blu makes fates super ez to grind tbh
[0:37:53] <%bunnyyumi> he looks like tuxedo mask thats kinda cool
[0:37:53] <%NopeBadguy> Limited job for limited people
[0:37:53] <neVan0> ewwwwww
[0:37:54] <%MisterTylerrr> Weird...my sound on my pc isn't working..
[0:37:56] <Isord> You are just jealous you can't puke fish Pat
[0:38:00] <Finaldragoon> well since Pat is always wrong, Blue Mage is therefore the best job
[0:38:02] <PanicSwytch> Whats a limited job?
[0:38:03] <alwaysneedcaffiene> I like these lalas better than the lalas in the source.
[0:38:05] <$metzselaar> Blue is a lot of fun
[0:38:10] <%penitentpentwitch> Nope, no luck this time
[0:38:10] <%Aeogard> not using blu to farm yokai watch LULW
[0:38:15] <KoyaMusa> nah you gotta have the quest that makes you talk to that wamutt dwarf
[0:38:21] <%hotheadedmoron> take the animation off the screen pat
[0:38:31] <Dwarven_Gaming> blu yokai watch is actually REALLY fun
[0:38:31] <+RocketBarrel> Time to mash Muscle Memory
[0:38:32] <+derivedknight> Pat! Rune Fencer or Beast Master for next Job @patstaresat
[0:38:33] <%Typhaeon> imagine needing veneration
[0:38:35] <%apostateCourier> gotta block chat, hhm
[0:38:37] <%NopeBadguy> Wait a sec, can't you do a spoiler cast with Clemps? I just thought about that
[0:38:40] <%LandOfTheWay> designed my characyer around being a bard; don't regret it a bit, but i do wish it could get some buffs
[0:38:59] <BallerSwagBro9k> Whats up Boomer Brain

[0:39:07] <+derivedknight> Bard just got some recent buffs
[0:39:09] <%MoonObscure> lol
[0:39:10] <bbHighvalor> you must hide the rpers
[0:39:10] <+Regigangster> That's actually genius and not something I see enough
[0:39:15] <%wjones0415> it sure is!
[0:39:15] <%Typhaeon> Don't show your ERP logs
[0:39:15] <AmericanaRed> BOOOO potastAngry potastAngry potastAngry
[0:39:19] <%valriot> bard lul
[0:39:22] <%hotheadedmoron> oh sorry, did know that
[0:39:22] <%Shockrates20XX> But then we won't see the stupid tank macros in real time.
[0:39:22] <%VioletHeart> Bard absolutely got buffs.
[0:39:24] <ASleepySnek> its 2%
[0:39:25] <+PatchworkSquid> BLU is ruining fates for those without AOE
[0:39:25] <%penitentpentwitch> BRD didn't really get much
[0:39:28] <+dujam> yeah the bard buffs did absolutely fuck all
[0:39:28] <%hotheadedmoron> did not
[0:39:28] <@SSaryn> BRD got a slap in the face
[0:39:28] <%marsantas> And to protect YOU from people posting stuff
[0:39:29] <+Regigangster> Thank you for the consideration of other people, Pat
[0:39:29] <+HelloImTom08> also that's how ppl get banned by showing chat names, and also being super toxic lol
[0:39:29] <%Psyramics> They got minor number buffs, nothing significant
[0:39:30] <%valriot> Bard plays like shit
[0:39:32] <+Neoripo> Bard got back to square 1
[0:39:34] <BallerSwagBro9k> Theres no menu option to hide chat?
[0:39:34] <+ishouldfeelbad> HyperCrown moon2PREGARIO true
[0:39:34] <KoyaMusa> don't show the pld in your run popping hallowed ground before the boss and saying oops
[0:39:34] <docstrangelove> Bard got their nerfs reverted
[0:39:34] <ManfredA> ranged dps are in a terrible spot right now
[0:39:36] <Blackjack760> it's very low
[0:39:37] <ManfredA> all of them
[0:39:39] <+khazdee> AST got nerfed
[0:39:40] <%ArcanumArcanum> BRD got literally nothing
[0:39:42] <+genowyn> Are you in like pentamelded aesthetes how did you get that much quality in one action
[0:39:43] <BluBox> It was a reverted nerf too
[0:39:44] <+Yakobro> ???
[0:39:46] <+Regigangster> LUL
[0:39:47] <%Valdorick> Placobuffs
[0:39:47] <%FlakkLIVE> they got like, 10 potency buffs
[0:39:48] <+HelloImTom08> bard is just kinda boring
[0:39:50] <RushUnplugged> Bard getting crumbs of what other jobs consider buffs
[0:39:50] <%penitentpentwitch> BRD basically got a 50 cent raise
[0:39:51] <%FlakkLIVE> its hilarious
[0:39:51] <%LaughingCatt> they got a good star sticker
[0:39:53] <%wjones0415> SMN NEEDS BUFFS!!
[0:39:54] <@SoFarFetched> psa1guy about Bards getting buffs
[0:39:56] <cyclone722> MCH is fun at least
[0:39:56] <%Typhaeon> He's facet
[0:39:56] <Ravoric> should I play monk or nah?
[0:40:00] <+derivedknight> Bard got buffs to get just a bit higher than Dancer
[0:40:00] <+dredgyboi> bard got a buff like spitting on a forest fire is helping
[0:40:01] <%ArcanumArcanum> BRD got told to switch to DNC
[0:40:02] <+PRocci18> Idk anything about this game, but did i just see one of the nier automata robots
[0:40:02] <sheepysenka> I got bard got crazy buffs but then I saw the bard in my party was in raid gear
[0:40:03] <+aphotophilic> i mean theyre bards so......
[0:40:03] <+Yakobro> they got their spam button buffed, their barrage buffed and 50 on their 1min
[0:40:05] <Calamity2007> @PatStaresAt Pat I love this game and played a lot but I am still nervous about wanting to do Extreme/Savage content, especially since I don't have much friends in game, any advice?
[0:40:09] <%debugdrawray_> drk got nothing because its perfect
[0:40:12] <+EvilSoully> BUFF DRAGOON
[0:40:12] <%CrookedSpiral> psaBougie on the bum
[0:40:14] <%DensityD> where's paige?
[0:40:14] <Finaldragoon> SMN got nerfed for literally no reason, because YoshiP has a hardon for BLM
[0:40:15] <+Neoripo> PFFFFF
[0:40:15] <%VioletHeart> To be fair you hit Refulgent Arrow and Burst Shot constantly so 10 potency means a lot over a long period of time.
[0:40:18] <Vengie14> Ranged DPS don't have to think during combat so it's good for dumb dumbs like me
[0:40:20] <@SSaryn> BRD was told to switch to ANYTHING ELSE.
[0:40:20] <%DensityD> is she really concusseD?
[0:40:24] <+WinstonThrasher> the ten potency they lost LAST patch
[0:40:24] <%FlakkLIVE> Bards back on top baby!
[0:40:26] <%weissguard> @PRocci18 Indeed. It's part of a raid series.
[0:40:26] <alwaysneedcaffiene> I'll stick with MCH.
[0:40:27] <ManfredA> SMN was op as shit
[0:40:28] <%MoonObscure> yup
[0:40:29] <+HelloImTom08> mch is sick tho
[0:40:31] <+NYCrownlessKing> you high? @Finaldragoon
[0:40:32] <%Metballs> SMN is disgusting
[0:40:33] <%DensityD> SUMM LUL
[0:40:35] <DougintheTrench> It's literally seeing a homeless man and giving him a penny.
[0:40:36] <@SSaryn> SMN got nerfed because it shouldnt be Top fucking 3.
[0:40:37] <+LittleBigQuebec> and BLM/SAM should be better dps
[0:40:38] <Blackjack760> Smn is op
[0:40:38] <%ArcanumArcanum> SMN nerf did practically nothing. It's still top DPS
[0:40:39] <%LaughingCatt> SMN needs even more small nerfs
[0:40:41] <+derivedknight> @ravoric Up to you really. Monk is okay
[0:40:42] <bbHighvalor> second best
[0:40:43] <BluBox> SMN is insanely op
[0:40:43] <+PRocci18> @weissguard whoa no way! automata is one of my favorite games
[0:40:43] <XyraFhoan> smn also got nerfed by like 2% worst case and is still a top 3 dps
[0:40:43] <%NopeBadguy> WAR got them sick QoL buffs that got them more meter and less buff management
[0:40:52] <%MisterTylerrr> Summoner played badly? Das me
[0:40:52] <%Stonebeard> tbh i don't even think the nerf to smn was too bad
[0:40:53] <%SXLCBBG> SXLCBBG subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:40:55] <%DensityD> reddit r/talesfromDF
[0:40:57] <@SSaryn> I'm surprised SMN didnt get 5 potency off both DoTs honestly
[0:40:59] <%Psyramics> Yeah, its super depressing seeing my 99% parse on BRD getting outdone by mid 70 parses on other classes
[0:41:00] <%MoonObscure> summoner is my main since i started this game back in 2017 , rest of you suck
[0:41:00] <%mikessdd> NIN got no changes lol
[0:41:00] <%LandOfTheWay> yeah, the bard buffs were basically nothing. still like playing one, but they need to be improved
[0:41:00] <+SpectrumSpy> I’m a SMN main and we had that nerf coming
[0:41:01] <%Neryl_> so... swap to smn?
[0:41:01] <%SirGO0SE> summoner SHOULD be good bc for some reason the game forced me to be one for 30 levels
[0:41:01] <%valriot> SMN is fucking busted, SMN main needs to take a fucking seat
[0:41:07] <%ArcanumArcanum> All the BRD buff did was tell BRD players to switch to DNC
[0:41:07] <+SinisterBroccoli> just buff everything else
[0:41:08] <RushUnplugged> SMN gets nerfed because it's a bad class for tryhards
[0:41:17] <%RyTYoung> So I picked good?
[0:41:19] <+derivedknight> As a Warrior main I can finally heal myself without mashing through the party list
[0:41:19] <%penitentpentwitch> SMN is getting Yoshi-P aggro
[0:41:22] <XyraFhoan> no, actual smn mans nodded their heads and agreed "yeah nerf us"
[0:41:24] <%LaughingCatt> Its so good
[0:41:24] <aeonicvector> Still the best AoE, with shit tons of dot options, and a rotation with huge payoffs
[0:41:24] <%wjones0415> Yeah, but SMN could be better than best!
[0:41:24] <%thegreatbambe> War is hella fun now
[0:41:26] <alwaysneedcaffiene> I got SMN to 80 and shelved it.

[0:41:30] <+mikesapartment> warrior some brain dead gameplay now
[0:41:31] <+derivedknight> And no more Stormseye uptime
[0:41:32] <ManfredA> YEYEYEYE
[0:41:33] <%ChunyiSnowpetal> Yo the warrior changes are so good.
[0:41:33] <Calamity2007> I really need to try out SMN one day. My DPS I focus on currently is SAM and RDM
[0:41:35] <ManfredA> WAR is big fun
[0:41:36] <%FlakkLIVE> I can't main WAR anymore it's too boring
[0:41:38] <+Basilias_Maximus> Smn nerf wasn't even a nerf. Who uses Tri-disaster for anything other than proccing the dots?
[0:41:41] <%baronblank> baronblank subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 12 month streak! Dang, a whole year of subs for my favorite gremlin man. Just beat heavensward 3.3 in ff14 and loving it, playing mainly gunbreaker and levelling red mage and dragoon on the side to play dps with friends, which would you recommend? keep up the good work
[0:41:41] <%MisterTylerrr> LET ME USE TORNADO KICK
[0:41:42] <%NopeBadguy> Don't forget that Eye works like Huton now and IR gives 15s on Eye, so there's less buff management which means more meter gain
[0:41:42] <+LittleBigQuebec> which means ultra big dick pulls will be even beter
[0:41:42] <+michingmallecho> Dodged hasBaited
[0:41:42] <%the22cstomp> they already got baby buffs pat
[0:41:47] <Drigoooooo> Solo runs with WAR
[0:41:47] <sheepysenka> blood bath returns to war!
[0:41:48] <Murphio_GS> Damn
[0:41:49] <%Metballs> They got the baby buffs, next patch is the rework
[0:41:49] <%Dwarven_Gaming> no, they already got the buffs, NEXT patch is the reowrk
[0:41:50] <+Arkfyre> yea monk needs total reword
[0:41:51] <%honeyman18> Monk is a fuck and I hate playing it as my only job
[0:41:51] <Finaldragoon> the nerf would be more understandable if it had an actual job identity. current SMN is like 5 different job ideas and the 14 devs have no idea what it wants to be
[0:41:52] <+Neoripo> leveling MNK is misery
[0:41:57] <+LeroyOctopus> I might switch back to mnk then
[0:41:59] <Isord> Might as well remove them
[0:42:01] <%MisterTylerrr> LEMME USE MY BIG MOVES
[0:42:01] <ManfredA> now buff abyssal drain back to where it used to be
[0:42:11] <KoyaMusa> no the rework is coming around 5.4, not next expansion. they said they don't want to make us wait as much
[0:42:13] <+HelloImTom08> finally flash buff, fucking need that forever, huge sustainable and I don't have to worry about ppl being alive to use flash
[0:42:13] <%valriot> Good, anyone who enjoys Monk now is wrong
[0:42:16] <heartlesshealer> Thanks for the HyperGravity @king_wragles
[0:42:17] <%LaughingCatt> I want a proper Shoryuken
[0:42:23] <Calamity2007> @ManfredA Yep I agree
[0:42:25] <XyraFhoan> just delete drk's salted earth and put in a skill that's actually fun to use
[0:42:31] <lovesosa236> now I feel like I chose the wrong starting class :(
[0:42:32] <Isord> is 5.4 the new Eureka stuff too?
[0:42:34] <%honeyman18> At least I look kind of cool with the kicks and stuff, but its so many clicks a second
[0:42:34] <+EvilSoully> Can they buff DRG's Battle Litany? From 15% buff to 50% would be nice
[0:42:36] <+zevitunez> IS paladin a good tank?
[0:42:38] <ManfredA> no
[0:42:40] <+k7991> I hope they give MNK something extra to do if they're getting rid of GL, because as much as it sucks now it'll be super boring with it gone
[0:42:42] <ManfredA> stop deleting DRK's good animations
[0:42:44] <%NopeBadguy> YOU'RE FIRED
[0:42:53] <%Typhaeon> Banished to the wastes of Party Finder
[0:42:54] <ManfredA> @zevitunez PLD is top dps tank and has the highest aggro generation
[0:42:55] <%SpcOpsBear> OH MY GOD Pat, no! The text size on your map is setting off my anxiety
[0:42:55] <+Neoripo> I miss Kildibrand
[0:42:57] <+pyrojack6> when does Heavensward start, I literally don't care about this Crystal Braves story
[0:42:58] <ManfredA> at least afaik
[0:43:02] <+derivedknight> Like Anatman, Tornado Kick and Six Sided Star will literally have to become entirely new skills if GL becomes a Trait
[0:43:04] <%Bearjewpiter> psaDown you're out
[0:43:04] <XyraFhoan> salted earth isn't a good animation either!! Just give back scourge :(
[0:43:05] <%mike2hands> Thanks for the HyperHex @king_wragles
[0:43:09] <Calamity2007> @lovesosa236 It's fine, this game allows it to be easy to change, plus MNK could become good again
[0:43:20] <%LandOfTheWay> @pyrojack6 don't worry, it comes next
[0:43:20] <%NopeBadguy> guys i got scouted out for an ultimate group and i'm so happy

[0:43:27] <%marsantas> It's like a shotgun to the tedium of crafting
[0:43:27] <KoyaMusa> honestly what i really wonder is how blm is going to change next expansion. they're basically perfect as is and i fear they'll get bloat like monk
[0:43:29] <%crimsonharvest> it should be as trivial as a -10 level mob
[0:43:29] <%LaughingCatt> its a god send
[0:43:30] <+zevitunez> @ManfredA thx lordsLove
[0:43:33] <+Yakobro> @derivedknight thank god lol
[0:43:37] <@SoFarFetched> Thanks for the HyperMine @aeogard
[0:43:38] <+derivedknight> Making it so I cam finally use the best looking skills with SSS and TL? Baller
[0:43:39] <Finaldragoon> @NYCrownlessKing I'm not high, YoshiP is clearly biased towards his favorite job
[0:43:39] <heartlesshealer> !
[0:43:41] <%penitentpentwitch> Lost Actions
[0:43:44] <@PlagueOfGripes> oh yeah, crafting skills. forgot about that
[0:43:51] <%nimu290> is nin worth leveling?
[0:43:52] <%valriot> Salted earth is just awful
[0:43:52] <skyheys> I want Power Slash back.
[0:44:02] <skyheys> @nimu290 Yes
[0:44:02] <+raybob23> is MCH still nothing?
[0:44:03] <%NopeBadguy> IT'S BASICALLY JUST FRACTURE
[0:44:05] <XyraFhoan> gnb is almost old drk though not quite
[0:44:09] <%Psyramics> 120?
[0:44:10] <BlueLunecy> I miss all the sick animations from the removed DRK skills
[0:44:17] <%Metballs> MCH is great
[0:44:17] <%LaughingCatt> I knows Scourge had a cool animation but what is everyones obsession with a weak ass 1 button DoT
[0:44:19] <Calamity2007> @nimu290 Yeah I've seen a lot of really good NIN playerws
[0:44:26] <ManfredA> they just murder all of DRK's good animations
[0:44:27] <%Metballs> A little low on DPS, but not awfulk
[0:44:32] <KoyaMusa> but nooo drk and war dot bad
[0:44:32] <%nimu290> nice
[0:44:35] <+EvilSoully> MCH is really high DPS now but needs godlike internet
[0:44:43] <Snookasaurus> damn this game hasn't aged well richkidS
[0:44:49] <ManfredA> MCH's dps is still bottom 4
[0:44:51] <+Neoripo> Can't believe they made sense of the heart of Savik
[0:44:51] <+sirisvirus> All Phys Ranged DPS need a bump in damage
[0:44:53] <+k7991> This has some serious Function vs Function energy
[0:44:53] <ManfredA> it's not really high
[0:44:59] <%mikessdd> NIN is fun to play for me. So that’s why I play it.
[0:45:20] <+derivedknight> That's some low quality bait @snookasaurus
[0:45:21] <%Aeogard> drk go hahaha shield
[0:45:22] <ManfredA> living shadow is what automaton queen should be
[0:45:27] <%DensityD> math DansGame
[0:45:29] <skyheys> NIN is the "fuck it, wing it" class
[0:45:31] <%NopeBadguy> The big problem with Living Shadow is that if the boss moves around too much, it'll replace moves with either Plunge or Flood @PatStaresAt
[0:45:31] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> "this game hasn't aged well"? lol who the fuck
[0:45:34] <%DensityD> ur a dump ass, not me
[0:45:36] <%krazy_likeafox> showing up to stream to hear furious calculator noises... sounds about right like ffxiv lol
[0:45:37] <+k7991> "I liked this because it has a cool animation" "But the numbers though"
[0:45:40] <%Valdorick> and its a stand
[0:45:41] <%FlakkLIVE> PogChamp
[0:45:41] <BluBox> Yeah but Scourge made a cool noise
[0:45:41] <%DensityD> I'm not a chicken, ur a turkey
[0:45:42] <%MisterTylerrr> Now THAT'S math.
[0:45:44] <+neroame> And it's a stand

[0:45:51] <neVan0> Pog
[0:45:53] <ManfredA> @NopeBadguy afaik that doesn't matter since all its attacks are the same potency
[0:45:54] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls
[0:45:55] <%DensityD> BUT WHO WAS PHONE!?!?!?
[0:45:58] <@SSaryn> Idk I hear a lot of MATH, not Scourge back in the game Kappa
[0:45:59] <XyraFhoan> yeah, living shadow's cool, I'd just rather not deal with placing salted earth on the ground anymore because ground targeting that is annoying and it doesn't even give blood anymore and the potency is insulting for the effort
[0:46:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:46:01] <%DensityD> PogChamp
[0:46:03] <%KuroStardust> I WANT 2 DOTS

[0:46:32] <+EvilSoully> @PatStaresAt What would be your opinion on buffing DRG? Maybe battle litany being a 50% crit buff and blood/life of the dragon also affecting dragonfire dive

[0:46:43] <%Noelle_of_the_Nova> I wish Arcanist, summoner, and scholar got shadow flare back
[0:46:45] <%DensityD> WHO'S TALKING?
[0:46:46] <@SSaryn> Time to see Pat play MNK badly
[0:46:48] <XyraFhoan> macros don't buffer well and also don't work well on the large immobile bosses that are halfway off the arena :(
[0:46:50] <%Metballs> I miss a lot of HW
[0:46:50] <ManfredA> @XyraFhoan they should make salted earth work like Garuda's ground dot and just auto target your target
[0:46:54] <skyheys> @asleepysnek same, Power Slash looked great
[0:46:56] <KoyaMusa> why so much noise now

[0:49:17] <%honeyman18> Why would you?
[0:49:17] <%ryome> Hot chauffeur
[0:49:17] <%NopeBadguy> Lamia is hardcore casual. They're heavy crafting and got a good amount of raiders, but not as much as Exodus IIRC.
[0:49:18] <%nimu290> I don't like that
[0:49:18] <%SirGO0SE> anymore? i havent started to yet...
[0:49:25] <%Typhaeon> It's all Indian scammers' TTS messages about car warranties or IRS scams
[0:49:25] <sakeydo> the codependancy grows!
[0:49:28] <%Typhaeon> here at least
[0:49:28] <FlakkLIVE> Its so weird to me that you can just move to different servers to buy from other markets
[0:49:28] <%Ciglossonjr> Ayyyyy Lamia is where i’m at
[0:49:29] <KoyaMusa> you read the dialogue once and then mash
[0:49:30] <%ClericOfSparda> Yadda Yadda Yadda
[0:49:31] <%debugdrawray_> shouts out to excal
[0:49:33] <+mikesapartment> its casual but no shit like famfrit
[0:49:34] <Kain5707> Exodus is chill too
[0:49:34] <%SpcOpsBear> oh yeah the beast tribe quests aren't interesting until you hit a story milestone
[0:49:35] <+EvilSoully> Gilgamesh is raid server 1, Sargantas is #2 I'm pretty sure
[0:49:37] <thememeticwind> What world is pat on chat?
[0:49:37] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> Don’t fuck with us Crystal Players, we’ll ERP in your house
[0:49:44] <%RyTYoung> @patstaresat What about when you go to Woolies again for the podcast? Or do you think you guys will continue to record at separate places?
[0:49:44] <cyclone722> yeah, lamia is a good mix of people
[0:49:44] <%krazy_likeafox> see you say that but did y'all see the tweet thread of a bunch of gatherers attempting to do fates on lamia
[0:49:46] <+r_Foeburden87> I'm on lamia

[0:49:54] <datlambo458> what about monk is bad

[0:49:54] <neVan0> LUL
[0:49:55] <+LittleBigQuebec> MNK was my last class to 80
[0:49:56] <heartlesshealer> greedy frog
[0:49:57] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> Monk players don't even like to play monk
[0:49:58] <skyheys> I made the mistake of trying to grind Monk on Fates
[0:50:00] <KoyaMusa> you could just run away, don't even have to bother
[0:50:00] <+LittleBigQuebec> and for good reason
[0:50:01] <%honeyman18> It's true suffering, that makes it deeper
[0:50:06] <PrimordialDonut> i moved to hyperion yesterday, away from lamia
[0:50:07] <%weissguard> SQUIRTLE NOO
[0:50:10] <%Evil_Emu147> I'm on Lamia too! Lamia is pretty casual and is also a crafting haven.
[0:50:14] <+mikesapartment> where is your yokai mount
[0:50:15] <%LaughingCatt> at least Monk has a few Tonfa's, so thats cool
[0:50:15] <%NopeBadguy> Monk? More like JUNK
[0:50:22] <heartlesshealer> So you're admitting that you will touch blue mage one day
[0:50:24] <@CreepyPorpoise> monk feels bad to play, but I don't think I'd say its as bad as Pats making it sound
[0:50:24] <%SirGO0SE> what should i look for as far as when the story gets good? so far ive regretted every single time i havent skipped it, level 40 right now
[0:50:25] <%Shockrates20XX> I'm not gonna level BRD and BLM to even 50 because they aren't fun to play.
[0:50:25] <neptious> what will be last class
[0:50:32] <skyheys> @datlambo458 Big requirements for positioning, hit lots of buttons,mediocre results
[0:50:32] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt game is very low or silent
[0:50:34] <%weissguard> I can't believe Squirtle is fucking dead. NotLikeThis

[0:50:37] <$metzselaar> Anyone else here on famfrit?
[0:50:38] <+TheDestinyPotato> Why do so many people hate Monk? I leveled it to 80 a few months ago and it definitely isn't my favorite but I don't understand why so many people hate it.
[0:50:38] <lovesosa236> should I just move to a diffre t class if I'm 32 as a pugilist?
[0:50:41] <+SH1NK1R0> I was a lamian until i was kidnapped by some friends i made on famfrit
[0:50:44] <%krazy_likeafox> last class for me was monk bc i don't have enough naruto brain cells
[0:50:45] <BluBox> That doesn't count!
[0:50:46] <%SpcOpsBear> Or is it like Ultros where you're either an omnicrafter or you can't afford mats?
[0:50:46] <%Chichen> SeemsGood

[0:52:57] <+NYCrownlessKing> no @ShepardUA thats why they literally gave u that free trial
[0:53:02] <@CreepyPorpoise> if you're going to lose your stacks because you're not fighting another enemy, you may as well use tornado kick.

[0:53:23] <+derivedknight> TK is a skill that makes you spend all your Grease Lightning stacks for q High Potency hit. Which for a long dungeon or Raid? FUCK THAT

[0:53:38] <+NYCrownlessKing> thats why paige keeps getting pink eye Kappa

[0:55:11] <%ogtrashwizard> Why do people insist on using Quasar in FATES for this event
[0:55:15] <+derivedknight> But mow that they've made it so Form Shift increases your time no matter what form? EVen less reason to use SSS
[0:55:15] <PanicSwytch> Words
[0:55:17] <fairore> lmao
[0:55:17] <+Berb64> F4T3 LYFE!

[0:55:27] <Admiral_PopnFresh> INTO STORES
[0:55:27] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PatStaresAt Level 72 is literally the moment BLM clicks completely and becomes awsome
[0:55:32] <+LittleBigQuebec> also Paige is right
[0:55:37] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Well I did just get a Rathalos queue in under 5 minutes
[0:55:41] <%the22cstomp> @derivedknight any time you would form shift it's better to SSS because you get more dps
[0:55:42] <datlambo458> k

[0:56:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> UK IS WORSE
[0:56:00] <%marsantas> Well france is HORRIFIC for driving, I'd assume Qubec is the same
[0:56:01] <+snausages_> look at pat doing blm rota I thought he didnt like this class
[0:56:06] <neptious> even Chicago, Paige?

[0:56:11] <%thewordofhelix> didnt know they let the blind drive in canada
[0:56:13] <%Aleate> Interesting that everyone is saying 72 for BLM when I stopped at 64 to be a RDM otzConcern
[0:56:14] <%NopeBadguy> Do they drive on the left or right side in Canada?
[0:56:14] <%Bearjewpiter> Indiana represent
[0:56:16] <wibbwobbler> rude drivers?
[0:56:17] <+Ghufufin> what part of FL? it varies
[0:56:18] <RayCSmooth> russia
[0:56:18] <+LowBatteryLife> quebec is the florida of canada

[0:56:21] <+KaiserKnuckles> I play monk. it's fun
[0:56:25] <%SirGO0SE> theres no speed limit on the high way in italy and the cops have lambos its awesome
[0:56:26] <$Rashnam> florida is not that bad compared to Chicago or DC.
[0:56:28] <+french_overlord> so the quality of driver comme with the quality of the road then? haha
[0:56:31] <Focant> quebec drivers are quite bad haha
[0:56:31] <sakeydo> try New Orleans
[0:56:31] <%Daskolin> Russia or Ukraine
[0:56:34] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Did you drive in like, Miami? Cause driving here is awful. We also got a LOT of people from quebec and it's AWFUL.
[0:56:36] <%Valdorick> Yeyeyeye Blackmage and tank the ground!
[0:56:41] <%crimsonharvest> The drivers on the TX/MX border (brownsville) were terrifying. 50% ancient snowbirds and 95% drinking in the car
[0:56:44] <AncelDeLambert> hey nerds, hey Orb nerd
[0:56:48] <%JD_Lars> LA and NYC are awful
[0:56:50] <ttc_lover> Compared to Toronto
[0:56:50] <BallerSwagBro9k> @bearjewpiter Hoosier Daddy LUL
[0:56:52] <+dredgyboi> Pat is Quebec man
[0:56:54] <%RyTYoung> UK has a loooot of potholes overall
[0:56:57] <%weissguard> DC is complicated.
[0:56:58] <%CzeekyPlays> Chicago drivers are gleefully rude
[0:56:59] <%blaccbird914> DC and the whole NOVA area sucks
[0:57:00] <Raztron> Chicago has some snow
[0:57:00] <%Aeogard> paige, Kentucky is the worst i've seen so far, worse than chicago
[0:57:00] <%Psyramics> It sucks to drive everywhere
[0:57:00] <+maenos2> dc isn't bad
[0:57:01] <ttc_lover> Compared to Toronto?
[0:57:06] <Chaossheep> Pat giving no shit about any aoe
[0:57:07] <%SirGO0SE> driving in ny is just moving while parked :)
[0:57:09] <Raztron> automatically better
[0:57:10] <%Aleate> Chicago is the Quebec of America otzConcern
[0:57:10] <%mike2hands> DC DEEZ NUTS
[0:57:10] <zenith0111> I just started Stormblood how long is it going to be before Shadowbreakers?
[0:57:11] <tanarath> Paige, they have great public transit in dc, though
[0:57:15] <%maenos2> Now northern Virginia, that suckw
[0:57:16] <%TallYoda08> HyperParkour HyperParkour
[0:57:17] <%LtSurge> Michigan is fine until you get those roads that are just potholes
[0:57:20] <%JD_Lars> Atlanta is terrible
[0:57:20] <neptious> I hate driving through Chicago cuz intersections are a suggestion
[0:57:21] <ttc_lover> Quebec and Alberta is a USA of Canada
[0:57:21] <%endyfilter> endyfilter subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Pat, not trying to upset you but will you eventually play banjo kazooie and talk about why you dislike the game?
[0:57:23] <%NopeBadguy> FEELS DROPPED CAST MAN
[0:57:23] <@CreepyPorpoise> its true, the worst drivers on the road here in Ontario all have QC plates.
[0:57:24] <%AncelDeLambert> hey Pat, why should I run FATEs?
[0:57:26] <ethey16> new york?
[0:57:26] <%tinyswampthing> Atlanta is hell to drive through
[0:57:28] <%thegreatbambe> Slide casting on blm feels weird
[0:57:29] <%krazy_likeafox> DC is a weird amalgamation of gentrification and road design by 18th century committee
[0:57:32] <Raztron> Outside the cities is fine to drive
[0:57:32] <floatRand> Slidecasting feels so gooood
[0:57:35] <skyheys> Atlanta
[0:57:36] <illtima> Pat help! I'm so close to dropping FFXIV. I'm at MSQ around 37-38 and this is THE MOST BORING SHIT EVER
[0:57:39] <%Aeogard> Near Louisville it's the worst and the roads are actually really thin :(
[0:57:41] <%JD_Lars> Kentucky isn’t bad at all
[0:57:42] <%Kyoshikei> FUCK DRIVING IN FLORIDA
[0:57:43] <%SirGO0SE> theres a lot of pressure driving in NYC but you just tune everyone out and youre good
[0:57:44] <%crimsonharvest> Rotate, pat
[0:57:53] <%LandOfTheWay> rhode island drivers fucking suck. and so do swiss drivers while i'm at it
[0:57:53] <CandideCamera> I've driven all the way across Florida in the middle of a hurricane evacuation and it was less trouble than driving in DC
[0:57:55] <tanarath> i went to the airport to downtown & back for $7 total for two people.
[0:57:55] <%ShootThatZombie> have you driven in new york?
[0:58:01] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Thanks for the HyperCooldown @flakklive
[0:58:01] <floatRand> Illtima: That's the hump
[0:58:02] <+LittleBigQuebec> I also did the Lux weapon for BLM durring the 5.2 downtime
[0:58:08] <%aishman> Sadly due to car crashes (also terrible job that made me constantly fall asleep behind the wheel) I now have a trauma of driving and get panic attacks. FUN TIMES.
[0:58:11] <+LittleBigQuebec> it took a while but it was fun
[0:58:11] <%krazy_likeafox> if you live in DC you don't drive in DC
[0:58:14] <%the22cstomp> Xenoglossy is orgasmic
[0:58:14] <Klefth> That is such a dumb name

[0:58:46] <%MisterTylerrr> So is Fate grinding good for all levels or just 70-80?
[0:58:46] <Flakari> GYou should get used to never using Fire II
[0:58:51] <%angel949> lol
[0:58:53] <sakeydo> stupid queastion, does DC stand gir anything? As in Washington DC.
[0:58:53] <%SirGO0SE> oh god now she has an excuse
[0:58:54] <neptious> Chicago you'll see a lambo behind 5 cyclists going 5mph
[0:59:02] <Flakari> Fire II is bad
[0:59:04] <tetriata> Which sound effect do you like more? Flare or Foul?
[0:59:08] <%penitentpentwitch> Wait... so she's driving with bad glasses?
[0:59:16] <Klefth> I'm leveling DRG because falling off platforms as my main RDM was not enough forme
[0:59:17] <%asgard147> but you shop tho limesThink
[0:59:20] <%angel949> Hey pat I'm enjoying the game a lot more than I thought I would (Currently lvl. 35 smnr). Should I hit 60 in free trial or just buy game now?
[0:59:21] <%JD_Lars> Did she get her Adderall yet?
[0:59:21] <%MisterTylerrr> Ok cool. Thank you, boss
[0:59:24] <neptious> yeah we used to have Washington AC @sakeydo
[0:59:24] <PrimordialDonut> or you want them music rolls for shb zones
[0:59:26] <%Valdorick> Oh man Crimsonharvest, the best, the absolute *BEST* is going from WA to Oregon, where its a DIFFERENT level of crazy drivers
[0:59:28] <%Neryl_> @PatStaresAt No Yokai Watch fate grinding? D:
[0:59:28] <KoyaMusa> stormblood and shadowbringer fates have exp bonuses, so there's that
[0:59:29] <%Bailey__gaming> what are Fates? like dailys?
[0:59:29] <+derivedknight> Gotta get my Shiva Savage Clear before next patch.
[0:59:33] <+DoctorDerp388> PAT WHY AREN'T YOU DOING YOKAI
[0:59:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> Grinding is Fate isn't hard. Just use 3 Berserkers and you're good
[0:59:43] <SummonerMagno> fate grind now while the event is happening
[0:59:45] <+french_overlord> how do you setup your control scheme with a controller to access your skill outside the RT/LT
[0:59:59] <%crimsonharvest> Yeah @Valdorick I have driven that bit of freeway from Kennewick to Portland many times and its a circus
[1:00:00] <%Valdorick> FATE/Grind; Queue
[1:00:00] <%Aeogard> fate grinding can be real fun in a weird, grindy way
[1:00:00] <%NopeBadguy> How many Fires does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll Pop?
[1:00:00] <shinji_ifrit> how are you liking BLM? @PatStaresAt
[1:00:00] <+zevitunez> The sountrack in this game is amazing
[1:00:05] <%krazy_likeafox> see i just bully all my FC mates who I helped give faster queue times to as a tank main when i'm leveling DPS classes xD
[1:00:08] <+derivedknight> He has a YouTube video about that actually @french_overlord
[1:00:13] <%Neryl_> @Bailey__gaming They're like public quests. Little events that everyone in the zone can participate in that give a good chunk of XP and (some) cash.
[1:00:13] <ethey16> @patstaresat how many hours do you have in this game?
[1:00:15] <BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah during events u get tons of Awakening mats
[1:00:16] <+TunyNinja> @angel949 Might as well just hit 60 on the free trial then buy it when you hit the cap, you get more days from that
[1:00:21] <@CreepyPorpoise> Pat go get your clan Nutsy stuff so you can double dip EXP on these fates. >:C
[1:00:22] <+derivedknight> Walls you through his controller setup
[1:00:23] <heartlesshealer> will never not love this music
[1:00:25] <%Aeogard> I got MCH 70-80 with fates, was real good
[1:00:26] <+french_overlord> @derivedknight oh thanks i'll go and check it out
[1:00:26] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PatStaresAt idk if you care, but if convert is off cd, you can pull a F4 Dispair bonus
[1:00:28] <+JingKaisean> what is BLM?
[1:00:31] <BallerSwagBro9k> BLM is fun?
[1:00:34] <+snausages_> despair->manafont->fire4->despair btw
[1:00:36] <%penitentpentwitch> BLM feels a bit like DRG, the QoL is backloaded past 70
[1:00:38] <%Valdorick> Blackmage
[1:00:39] <Ell1ot> Black Mage
[1:00:44] <+blazecc> Pat letting firestarter procs fall off like a NOOB
[1:00:45] <%the22cstomp> black mage is very fun
[1:00:49] <+Estuko> Hell, in Dissidia Opera Omnia (mobile game) Alisaie has a rotation with her skills regarding the spells she casts.
[1:00:53] <floatRand> That's BLM life
[1:00:53] <BallerSwagBro9k> @jingkaisean Black Lives Matter
[1:00:54] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> BLM really shines when you have a shit ton of spell speed

[1:02:20] <%ClericOfSparda> get off the birb
[1:02:23] <vVAstrAVv> be sure you work sharpcast into your rotation pat it can be used before every fire one now
[1:02:26] <KoyaMusa> you can sell one of your onions you only need one more
[1:02:29] <+mikesapartment> at the stable?
[1:02:32] <cyclone722> oh I thought you need a stable
[1:02:45] <%primal04> primal04 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[1:02:46] <%M3djedx> psaSmug
[1:02:52] <%Mendin> Pat just from interactions, not quests/rewards, who are your favorite beast tribes and if they aren't the Vanu Vanu why not
[1:02:52] <%the22cstomp> a lot of black mage is minor optimizations dont worry
[1:02:56] <%krazy_likeafox> that was me a month ago
[1:03:01] <+HelloImTom08> lol
[1:03:01] <%Chichen> DRK is just edgy WAR
[1:03:03] <Keninrebo> Same thing Kappa
[1:03:04] <%Valdorick> You better have your main on lock.
[1:03:05] <%krazy_likeafox> i have my amaro now tho
[1:03:06] <%weissguard> Fell cleave go brrr
[1:03:08] <%Dwarven_Gaming> YEAH, so warrior
[1:03:09] <+DoctorDerp388> bad of all trades
[1:03:09] <%crimsonharvest> edge war
[1:03:11] <KoyaMusa> dark knight basically is warrior what do you mean :^)
[1:03:13] <%NopeBadguy> To be fair, they made DRK better by making it more like WAR Kappa
[1:03:14] <+HelloImTom08> true
[1:03:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> you're not gonna make it
[1:03:16] <+khazdee> get everything to 80 so you can be mediocre at everything and better than the average crystal player
[1:03:17] <%ClericOfSparda> The Kojin mount is best
[1:03:17] <%CzeekyPlays> It's okay pat, you know in your heart of hearts that warrior is superior
[1:03:19] <+neroame> gottem
[1:03:20] <%penitentpentwitch> Edgeless Knight
[1:03:21] <%Rumbutt> As a BLM main I absolutely hate running anything that syncs me down, once you hit 80 you're never gonna want to let go of xenoglossy
[1:03:22] <%MisterTylerrr> They're bot pretty edgie
[1:03:23] <+snausages_> Black mage is cool when you yeet yourself to ppl for mechanics then yeet back to leylines
[1:03:23] <%thegreatbambe> War is just angery DRK
[1:03:25] <+HelloImTom08> DK stole war's IR
[1:03:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> Warrior is just a crunchier Pugilist
[1:03:27] <vVAstrAVv> i mean i only JUST started working it in myself cus im also a tank main lol
[1:03:27] <%Chichen> l-lewd
[1:03:28] <Daxalog> Are their any early game classes that arent as boring as Black mage?
[1:03:29] <@CreepyPorpoise> when the heck did they change it so you dont need the stable to feed your bird
[1:03:38] <oceanmatt> ya
[1:03:40] <Dr_Angelic> Hey, for someone using a ps4 controller, what would you say has the easiest rotation, class-wise? (Tried playing WHM and targeting allies was super weird on controller)
[1:03:42] <Daxalog> Oh im sorry I meant to say: Thaumatergy
[1:03:43] <%MugenSandan> I have played samurai so much it has ruined my ability to play dragoon
[1:03:48] <%AncelDeLambert> hey, @PatStaresAt why do FATE?
[1:03:55] <KoyaMusa> nascent and chaotic cyclone x2 very good
[1:04:04] <+LittleBigQuebec> Durring inner release, it means you can full HP on big pulls
[1:04:06] <%Mendin> monk gets a full combo rotation by like level 8
[1:04:07] <tetriata> @Rumbutt Losing Xeno isn't great but the real pain starts when you get pulled into any sub-sixty content
[1:04:09] <+DoctorDerp388> the 5.3 change to war is a big QoL increase and a little damage boost
[1:04:10] <%AncelDeLambert> oh really

[1:05:49] <clloudberry> ABOOSE!
[1:05:49] <LordOfThePoultry> D:
[1:05:49] <%RyTYoung> @patstaresat or chat, how does one go about setting up macros?
[1:05:50] <+TheDestinyPotato> I can't believe Pat would do this
[1:05:51] <%Mendin> ah zangief is learning Face to Fist style
[1:05:52] <@SoFarFetched> paige would run into your fist too
[1:05:52] <%penitentpentwitch> "...so my dog fell down some stairs."
[1:05:53] <%cowardman93> eh it's fine bulldogs are tough as shit
[1:05:54] <+dredgyboi> whyd you punch doggo?:(
[1:05:54] <Isord> I CANT BELIEVE PAT BEATS HIS DOG
[1:05:55] <%angel949> she's gonna deal with him
[1:05:56] <%Aeoneth> Pat self admitted dog abuser
[1:05:58] <BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:05:59] <tanarath> Pat, he's literally you.
[1:06:00] <+Trusis_Bunny> vids
[1:06:04] <%mike2hands> he is never forgetting that
[1:06:07] <sakeydo> the baby dog so yappy, how do you tell good borks from bad?
[1:06:09] <+DoctorDerp388> real ones don't use them
[1:06:10] <%LandOfTheWay> zangief activated pat's counter frames
[1:06:12] <tetriata> @Rumbutt What? You don't like playing the "What's my rotation this dungeon?" game?
[1:06:18] <%NopeBadguy> Macros are just like programming with chat commands, dude
[1:06:20] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> psaDogchamp pvpSlay psaSmug Give me food Father
[1:06:22] <%penitentpentwitch> Factory Crafters, the highest tier of crafting
[1:06:24] <vVAstrAVv> you ask a mentor lol
[1:06:27] <MrKerb> This stream with the dog barking and fighting with your girlfriend reminds me of playing cod on 360
[1:06:27] <+snausages_> macros bad for dps
[1:06:33] <%CuppaHotJones> Just Like Paige 'runs into glass' too, huh?
[1:06:46] <SummonerMagno> just remember to put tons of anime references in your macros
[1:06:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> Since there is no picture, I assume Pat is drinking beers
[1:06:48] <%LadyTheWanderer> go get thems yokai bruh
[1:06:57] <+SH1NK1R0> Classic justification. "they just ran at my fist officer"
[1:06:58] <%AngriestAngryArtist> psaWink psaWink psaWink psaWink
[1:07:05] <vVAstrAVv> you really only need raise macros
[1:07:12] <Klefth> Man, the DRG quests are such a dumb tone shift it's hilarious
[1:07:13] <+snausages_> when you get sps up to a nice level it's a greay feeling class
[1:07:17] <%NopeBadguy> You say that until you play EX or Savage and then it forces you to move a ton
[1:07:20] <+DoctorDerp388> smn can give them all the clap simultaneously
[1:07:20] <%mikessdd> Running junk and leveling during these streams is super relaxing and helpful. Thanks pat
[1:07:21] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> but red mage flips doe
[1:07:23] <%asgard147> "Father! Why is the punching bag screaming again? Have you feed it?" psaPorgmo
[1:07:25] <%penitentpentwitch> The most immobile of artillery units
[1:07:29] <2DSuperiority> macro only the essential, like DRK's shadow man with your edgy anime quote
[1:07:30] <KoyaMusa> really wish yokai incentivized doing fates in shb areas but so much for tangible rewards :^)
[1:07:39] <+dom3800> @PatStaresAt How do you play with a controller? Don't you run out of buttons?
[1:07:40] <%SwdVengeance> Blm is just a turret that shoots nukes
[1:07:43] <vVAstrAVv> i like blm cus you can stand there just learning the fight while they die
[1:07:55] <%thegreatbambe> Eno-chan nooooo
[1:08:06] <+textandnumbers> worst thing about blm is the rotation changing every time you level sync though
[1:08:12] <%MisterTylerrr> Nah, it actually works out perfectly.
[1:08:13] <BallerSwagBro9k> EW CONTRO
[1:08:14] <%LandOfTheWay> honestly, i just don't care about the yokai event; doesn't seem worth the time investment for a franchise i care nothing for
[1:08:19] <BallerSwagBro9k> EW CONTROLLER
[1:08:21] <Klefth> More importantly, how the fuck do people play this game with a keyboard? Ew
[1:08:22] <%LadyTheWanderer> yea theres no way i can do controller, it seems so confusing
[1:08:22] <vVAstrAVv> 14s controller support is STELLAR
[1:08:30] <%RyTYoung> I'm using a controller okay
[1:08:30] <%AncelDeLambert> WTF I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE DOUBLE HOLD
[1:08:36] <%AncelDeLambert> AAAAAAAAH
[1:08:39] <%NopeBadguy> 16x5 = 80 buttons
[1:08:39] <%Typhaeon> Revolutionary controller support for an MMO
[1:08:41] <%Reveresao> @PatStaresAt I used your guide for setup controls and UI. Thanks for that.
[1:08:42] <+snausages_> blm is basically learn the fight first then optimise dps
[1:08:42] <+projectmanatees> same monkaS
[1:08:44] <+DoctorDerp388> how does anyone play this without an mmo mouse
[1:08:44] <LordOfThePoultry> jesus christ
[1:08:44] <%ashenfrenzy> the muscle memory you build on controller is hella strong
[1:08:47] <%AncelDeLambert> shit, I gotta redo my basics
[1:08:48] <+HitoBeat> Double tap is something you need to turn on
[1:08:49] <lovesosa236> when I hold one than the other it doesn't pop the back ones?
[1:08:50] <%afronooch> i got both and i feel foolish
[1:08:52] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> how do you target the right enemy?
[1:08:53] <%CzeekyPlays> Gotta explore the WXHB settings
[1:09:00] <%Evil_Emu147> I had not idea about the double tap!!!!!
[1:09:02] <%Psyramics> I actually have more buttons at my disposal on a controller than I did playing WoW with M+KB
[1:09:03] <%LadyTheWanderer> but what about suzaku ddr lol
[1:09:08] <+projectmanatees> i just always go to the second or third page
[1:09:25] <%RyTYoung> How do you double hold?
[1:09:26] <+neroame> That's exactly what I do
[1:09:34] <+SH1NK1R0> Yeah controller is great in this game
[1:09:38] <%DensityD> double weave that shit
[1:09:46] <+dom3800> Oh yeah I can see how switching bars is way quicker with controller
[1:09:46] <%Evil_Emu147> I just use a throwaway tab for my mounts and emotes
[1:09:46] <floatRand> Man, do you know what would make sidequests much better?
[1:09:51] <%ashenfrenzy> what i dont get is how he makes some icons stay there so he watch their cooldown even when theyre offscreen
[1:09:51] <floatRand> Make them reward bicolored gemstones
[1:09:53] <+DoctorDerp388> TIME FOR GAIUS
[1:09:58] <%Kyoshikei> I only use controller for gathering
[1:09:59] <%AncelDeLambert> ... you already lost me
[1:09:59] <ethey16> @patstaresat you gonna be checking out the new warframe update?
[1:10:00] <lovesosa236> thank goodness
[1:10:00] <%angel949> what does addle Actually do?
[1:10:04] <%LadyTheWanderer> i tried controller before but i'm bad with my left and right so i can't do it lol
[1:10:07] <+projectmanatees> prae
[1:10:08] <%DensityD> crysssssttttaaaaaaaaaallllllllllll

[1:11:08] <SummonerMagno> such devastation.... it was not my intention
[1:11:09] <+SH1NK1R0> You can even make the double hold bar "invisible" so it can only accessed with double tap and cant cycle on accident
[1:11:10] <%emperordread> are there femboy catboys in this game?

[1:14:03] <floatRand> I got 99 days and it depresses me. I got into during HW Horde patch.
[1:14:04] <%krazy_likeafox> @cascadepersona the MSQ should give a lot of XP but a few dungeon runs should do it
[1:14:07] <%twoto858> Hi Pat :)

[1:18:33] <Daxalog> Thaumaterge is so boring oh my god!
[1:18:42] <%MegboyManuel> How much would I have to donate to make you fantasia into a Lala?
[1:18:50] <%krazy_likeafox> ishgard is also gr8 for gathering
[1:19:11] <+NYCrownlessKing> yep, knew he'd say that
[1:19:19] <+A0N33> I had an experience with an MSQ skip sprout earlier today. They were a white mage that did nothing but cast Repose and Cure II in a lvl 80 dungeon, died immediately to the first boss then just lied face down until we kicked them for AFK
[1:19:20] <%SomeSageAdvice> wouldnt it be 20 dollars since you need to change back?
[1:19:22] <Flakari> $20?
[1:19:22] <%thegreatbambe> Oh yea?

[1:19:22] <%cvp5127> so 11
[1:19:23] <%thegreatbambe> How much
[1:19:25] <+NYCrownlessKing> how much to keep him a lala for the entirety of the next expansion.
[1:19:27] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> I still don't know how to target enemies BibleThump
[1:19:28] <+NYCrownlessKing> is the better question
[1:19:29] <%afronooch> i got 5 on it
[1:19:33] <%jyinwin> Any tips for good tanking Pat?
[1:19:34] <%thegreatbambe> I'd do $250
[1:19:35] <%MegboyManuel> 150 for like, a week?
[1:19:44] <%cowardman93> how much to make you stay lalafel until the end of 6.0?

[1:21:23] <%CzeekyPlays> Trigger+LB/RB? Not understanding
[1:21:24] <ManfredA> the biggest tanking tip I can possibly give is don't give in to the "tanxiety meme"
[1:21:30] <Admiral_PopnFresh> octoHack I'm in
[1:21:36] <+HitoBeat> dpad works for targeting party members for heals
[1:21:37] <Calamity2007> @PatStaresAt So do you use minimized UI?

[1:22:00] <Dr_Angelic> How do WHM targeting on controller without sacrificing party members for DPS or DPS for party members
[1:22:05] <rocksolidfromdragonsdogma> when will you be doing the dragons dogma stream
[1:22:07] <%Dwarven_Gaming> THEYRE ALL DOUG DIGADOME
[1:22:12] <%angel949> I agree, people have been real nice to me in dungeons when I mention I'm the new player
[1:22:13] <+NYCrownlessKing> you think this years Rising will show off any teases for the 4th expansion? @PatStaresAt
[1:22:13] <Profmcstevie> Hip hop anominator

[1:22:21] <+NYCrownlessKing> with no fanfest @PatStaresAt
[1:22:25] <+snausages_> target party members during WHM glare GCD
[1:22:32] <%MegboyManuel> now how do you speed run Nero's speech?
[1:22:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Dwarven_Gaming owner of the Dimsdale Dimadome? PogChamp

[1:22:50] <%CzeekyPlays> Weird, thanks
[1:22:52] <%valriot> FFXIV: Garlemalding
[1:22:52] <rocksolidfromdragonsdogma> hard mode dragons dogma coming up soon someone said? niice
[1:22:52] <%LegendGHT> wait what?
[1:22:52] <%Typhaeon> I thought it was German
[1:22:52] <2DSuperiority> for the Rising everyone will be lala, now perish
[1:22:54] <ManfredA> XIV's community tends to coddle the worst players or avoid confrontation for the sake of just getting through
[1:22:59] <%krazy_likeafox> holy shit my party actually did the fckin canons in castrum correctly
[1:23:00] <%MegboyManuel> damn
[1:23:06] <%FlakkLIVE> how did rising tease stuff before? totally missed that
[1:23:06] <%Valdorick> Talk faster
[1:23:08] <DetroitSentai> is it against TOS, have people gotten in trouble for the "skip"
[1:23:10] <%MegboyManuel> or japanese, japanese also faster speech
[1:23:10] <%krazy_likeafox> japanese for gaius is faster too
[1:23:13] <KoyaMusa> please respect the content. and its japanese that is faster
[1:23:17] <%LegendGHT> it's against TOS to tell us?
[1:23:18] <EnderGamma> JP VO is as well
[1:23:21] <SummonerMagno> german is slower i think
[1:23:28] <%LegendGHT> that's an odd TOS thing
[1:23:33] <PrimordialDonut> xiv's community is also full of deperessed and horny lonely weebs
[1:23:38] <%emperordread> That's true, cause all French sentences are "hon hon baguette je suis frenchman"
[1:23:41] <+WinstonThrasher> youre still in the instance for the same amount of time if you skip or not so why risk it
[1:23:44] <KoyaMusa> you know i'm being sarcastic
[1:23:46] <%QuantumCholo> Im glad pat uses a controller for this game cause my wow friends are elitists about only using keyboards for mmos
[1:23:48] <azacca_bitter> SUCH DEVASTATION!
[1:23:53] <skyheys> Respect it more!
[1:23:55] <DetroitSentai> depends on if i see a "first time" bonus at the start
[1:23:59] <%NopeBadguy> To be fair, the entire point of main scenario roulette is to get new players people to do their run of it
[1:24:01] <%MegboyManuel> Respect Prae if there are sprouts, is my deal
[1:24:02] <+LittleBigQuebec> IT WAS NOT MY INTENTION
[1:24:02] <%BIumen> D1CBAG
[1:24:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @LegendGHT To support behavior that ruins the dungeon for any newbies playing dungeon for the first time?
[1:24:03] <%Spydurman> Pat when will we see your pepperoni nips on OnlyFans?
[1:24:16] <%CzeekyPlays> Healing would seem easier on M+KB
[1:24:18] <+cubewarz> the WHM mentor on the balance uses a controller, lmao
[1:24:19] <+snausages_> ffxiv gcd is slower than WoW so controller is fine, although pre 5.3 AST really suffers
[1:24:20] <%valriot> FFXIV is built to wok with a controller in mind
[1:24:21] <TurtlesAndTentacles> damn I'm late
[1:24:21] <%thegreatbambe> E7s is hard as shit on controller
[1:24:25] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, I'm sure being a healer is much easier on keyboard
[1:24:25] <Klefth> Oh fuck that. Prae used to be the fastest way to farm tomes in 2.0, and when I came back to the game to this unskippable BS I wanted to tear my hair out
[1:24:26] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I missed the best part
[1:24:30] <%Badpest> witch NA data center should I choose... too much options
[1:24:31] <%mikessdd> Yeah at this point fuck it. They should only make you wait for cutscenes if there’s a first timer
[1:24:31] <%cowardman93> the game works really well for controller which I love
[1:24:35] <%LegendGHT> I still think it's really lame that you can't link your ps4 and PC characters somehow, would love to switch over to PC for the moment to play
[1:24:36] <%afronooch> pat retweeted a leak from his onlyfans last night wym
[1:24:37] <NemokillerV> Playing astro with controller is so much easier than clicking each person
[1:24:37] <@CreepyPorpoise> healing is perfectly easy on controller.
[1:24:37] <Calamity2007> I agree
[1:24:39] <commanderapathy> I refuse to use a keyboard
[1:24:40] <+snausages_> I heal on control it's alright I think, you get used to popping up and down the party list during casttimes
[1:24:40] <%SomeSageAdvice> HOWEVER, targeting specific items like the teleports in Prae as people are standing right in the way can be the most annoying thing and CAN get you killed
[1:24:41] <%AncelDeLambert> but tanking or crafting or dps? Go controller.
[1:24:47] <%valriot> I main AST on controller lmfao
[1:24:48] <+LittleBigQuebec> I guess the cards are hard yeah
[1:24:49] <@CreepyPorpoise> astro is also *not bad* on controller
[1:24:49] <+HitoBeat> Don't play on Crystal
[1:24:50] <$JamJamX3> Hiya, Pat! I'm curious, what would you think if they somehow made BLU into a full-fledged job and reworked?
[1:24:51] <Ks201> I actualy liked that about ast
[1:24:54] <+snausages_> Yeah sleeve draw is like some DMC combo shit on controller
[1:24:55] <%Shonen_hero> Shonen_hero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Hey Pat, just finished up ARR a couple days ago and I'm right there with you about Prae. I must've spent 36 to 40 hours doing Prae for those moogle tomes before the Moogle event ended. Got in late so I had to cram in what time I could
[1:24:59] <%AncelDeLambert> I see once I finish my paladin, I'm gonna have to learn keyboard
[1:25:01] <@spacecapncrone> up-down on your dpad automatically targeting party members helps a lot.
[1:25:02] <%afronooch> tanking on controller feels "right"
[1:25:02] <%SomeSageAdvice> mouse and keyboard is great but boy i want to chuck everyone out the window when they're standing on top of what i need
[1:25:05] <Calamity2007> I don't find AST bad to do on controller anymore. Maybe back before the rework
[1:25:12] <%TONYOO101> shame they gutted sleeve draw on ast
[1:25:13] <ManfredA> @Badpest Aether if you want LGBT communities or raiding for Gilgamesh, Primal for a mix of server cultures, Crystal for roleplay
[1:25:13] <%krazy_likeafox> i'm literally on AST on controller rn, i feel that lol
[1:25:14] <LloydHallam> I recently got all my jobs to 80, but ended up being 1 law tomestone short on the last day before 5.3, ended up running prae again to get it because I hate myself apparently.
[1:25:17] <%MegboyManuel> i prefer healing on controller tbh
[1:25:20] <+pandamancer224> maybe a hybrid of controller and keyboard? like select party using the F keys?
[1:25:20] <Klefth> @thegreatbambe It's annoying but not that bad. It sure beats having to use WASD for everything. Precise movement with that is... ew D:
[1:25:23] <MiraLangsuir> @SomeSageAdvice Numpad0 is your answer.
[1:25:24] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PatStaresAt you're BLU?
[1:25:25] <%MegboyManuel> new sleevedraw SUCKS
[1:25:29] <%weissguard> If you were green, you would dieee~
[1:25:29] <@spacecapncrone> also having party members that aren't all always dying horribly helps.
[1:25:30] <%MegboyManuel> no youre red
[1:25:31] <Blackjack760> please f for sleeve draw
[1:25:31] <+cubewarz> lol at some sage advice just numpad 0
[1:25:36] <%mikessdd> @legendght are you talking about 14? I switch between pc and ps4 on the same character all the time.
[1:25:39] <@CreepyPorpoise> WISH I KNEW WHAT THAT WAS LIKE
[1:25:40] <Ks201> i dont like the new sleeve draw they choped off two of my fingers
[1:25:41] <%SomeSageAdvice> how do @MiraLangsuir
[1:25:42] <DetroitSentai> @SomeSageAdvice you can just hold "x" to click through players if you're on m+kb
[1:25:42] <Klefth> FFXI Galka colors
[1:25:42] <%MegboyManuel> new sleeve draw is so unfun
[1:25:43] <heartlesshealer> Slate Blue
[1:25:44] <BoneBagMel> Is this a metal gear dungeon / raid?
[1:25:48] <%Aleate> Its green Kappa
[1:25:51] <@spacecapncrone> creepy49Porpkek
[1:25:58] <$shadow1man9> Press F for Astro's opener
[1:25:59] <%valriot> New Sleeve Draw is okay, i like it better for actually building to |Divination mid fight, but the longer pull is annoying
[1:26:00] <@CreepyPorpoise> creepy49Porpkek
[1:26:00] <NemokillerV> The new sleeve draw is neat but they should really decrease the cooldown
[1:26:02] <%SomeSageAdvice> oh my god, thank you @DetroitSentai
[1:26:04] <Calamity2007> AST is my only lvl 80 healer at the moment so I don't have much of a choice
[1:26:10] <+snausages_> I think the reason I like healing is it feels so active on controller during heal heavy content, at least with SCH. maybe not WHM
[1:26:11] <%cowardman93> Pat's character is actually the hat and not the person. The person is merely a host for the hat's will
[1:26:13] <vVAstrAVv> it belp to sort your party list dps jubs for cards
[1:26:14] <%Typhaeon> i did that back in HW, and yes it was stupid
[1:26:16] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt hey, I'm not stupid, I just like crafting
[1:26:16] <%Rumbutt> now are your ranged or casters gonna LB to open the fight
[1:26:16] <+WinstonThrasher> i kinda dig new sleeve draw, no more cursed draws when you really need to do divination
[1:26:16] <%BIumen> hey crafting is fun
[1:26:18] <MiraLangsuir> @SomeSageAdvice Numpad0 is the controller target/confirm button, and it prioritizes activatbles.
[1:26:19] <2DSuperiority> Nero you look so stupid I hate you stupid even
[1:26:19] <$JamJamX3> @PatStaresAt What do you think of BLU in general?
[1:26:20] <%LegendGHT> @mikessdd what? I thought they were seperate service account
[1:26:22] <%Rumbutt> cause that's the real Prae
[1:26:22] <%Badpest> @ManfredA thanks!
[1:26:24] <KoyaMusa> remember doing that in stormblood, capping miner cause you couldn't fucking pass rauhban
[1:26:28] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, I'm literally invisible while gathering
[1:26:30] <%krazy_likeafox> i am terrible at healing but i like the fast q for MSQ roulette lol
[1:26:31] <Jdrockefeller> CUL was my first 50 in arr days
[1:26:35] <%thegreatbambe> @Klefth I think its just annoying when you use camera and have to think about where to point in the new angle
[1:26:37] <%penitentpentwitch> Campin' those rare mat nodes
[1:26:40] <%cowardman93> blu bad, suck it blus
[1:26:40] <%AncelDeLambert> there's like five things that I have to kill enemies for
[1:26:41] <%Valdorick> I'm a level 51 weaver, a level 36 Blackmage, and I'm on a level 24 MSQ.
[1:26:42] <Calamity2007> Same
[1:26:43] <%NopeBadguy> it's not a real class and it's genuinely sad that now it never will be
[1:26:44] <%marsantas> Blue is the most failed experiment ever
[1:26:45] <%Valdorick> I think I have problems.
[1:26:47] <+LittleBigQuebec> BLU fucking lawnmowers FATES tho
[1:26:48] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Necromancer for next Magic DPS
[1:26:51] <%MegboyManuel> BLU in yokai watch even
[1:26:54] <2DSuperiority> respect the meme job
[1:26:57] <%LegendGHT> I haven't even touched the BLU quest
[1:27:02] <%RyTYoung> ooft
[1:27:02] <%mikessdd> @legendght they most certainly are not. It’s the same. You have to by the game twice though.
[1:27:04] <+HitoBeat> BLU is making Yokai real bad
[1:27:06] <%MegboyManuel> you gonna put any time into the Yokai Watch event?
[1:27:11] <%krazy_likeafox> blu isn't required for the amaro
[1:27:11] <+khazdee> its not
[1:27:12] <commanderapathy> blue...mage? what the hell is that?
[1:27:12] <%AncelDeLambert> that's a shame
[1:27:14] <%valriot> Its side gimmick content
[1:27:15] <+MisterRockett> It's a collectable thing.
[1:27:16] <%Higure_yoru> whats the advantages of having more than 1 character
[1:27:16] <%KuroStardust> It's not required for Amaro
[1:27:18] <LloydHallam> I forget BLU is a thing until I see the morbal mount tbh
[1:27:21] <%LegendGHT> @mikessdd oh yeah i'm not buying the game again just for that
[1:27:22] <+cubewarz> Missle baby halves enemy health
[1:27:25] <Calamity2007> @PatStaresAt Is Palace of the Dead good for grinding or just running dungeons is better?
[1:27:26] <%AncelDeLambert> @commanderapathy enemy ability user
[1:27:29] <%marsantas> It's the SOLO CLASS! That requires you to form groups to do content!
[1:27:35] <Klefth> To think BLU used to be so cool in XI, and how BAD they messed it up in this game thanks to its restrictive class system...
[1:27:35] <%MegboyManuel> yeyeye sperm ghost
[1:27:38] <%mikessdd> @legendght buying the game and expansions doesn’t count on pc. So you’d have to buy it again. That’s the thing that sucks.
[1:27:49] <+cubewarz> ERp reasonsa
[1:27:51] <%AncelDeLambert> dressing them up like pretty dolls
[1:27:53] <%Chichen> its 1 per WORLD
[1:27:55] <%penitentpentwitch> Multiple server clusters
[1:27:55] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> One character per world is the starter i thought
[1:27:59] <DetroitSentai> Entry sub isnt per account, it's per server
[1:28:05] <azacca_bitter> So you can RP live birth
[1:28:05] <%MegboyManuel> ERP with the other account
[1:28:09] <KoyaMusa> yeah, i'm crazy and have an fc full of my alts for storage and leves
[1:28:12] <+mikesapartment> extra access to dailies, resources and storage
[1:28:13] <%wjones0415> its not required
[1:28:14] <TioXyco> not per account, but per world
[1:28:14] <Calamity2007> @Klefth If I had someone to walk me through it I would love to give XI a try
[1:28:24] <+SH1NK1R0> Actually the starter one is 8 characters but they cant be on the same server
[1:28:24] <%MegboyManuel> Balmung erp
[1:28:29] <@spacecapncrone> to buy out an entire housing district
[1:28:41] <+Deekman> We eatin' eggs in here?
[1:28:47] <@CreepyPorpoise> I use mine for storage because I dont want to pay for extra retainers for housing items
[1:29:13] <%BIumen> crazy people got it
[1:29:15] <%AncelDeLambert> that sounds like pure insanity
[1:29:17] <%krazy_likeafox> most people i know have alt characters for doing multiple weekly savage clears?
[1:29:18] <+Berb64> so basically not worth it
[1:29:21] <@CreepyPorpoise> not mailing
[1:29:22] <azacca_bitter> very Nietzsche
[1:29:25] <%the22cstomp> I use my alt as a secondary for weekly raids in case i already cleared for a week
[1:29:26] <%afronooch> oh fuck i need that
[1:29:27] <+LittleBigQuebec> you can't to yourself dirrectly no?
[1:29:29] <%valriot> I mean its also if you wanna main more than 1 job/role at a time
[1:29:30] <%AncelDeLambert> I hate the inventory problmes in this game
[1:29:31] <KoyaMusa> tomes, leves for gil, its really for nuts people
[1:29:33] <@CreepyPorpoise> putting words in my mouth, the audacity
[1:29:33] <LilacsandFreedom> and here I was thinking it was to play with friends on other servers...
[1:29:34] <%krazy_likeafox> you can't mail someone you're not friends with
[1:29:36] <$apolitenoob> Hey Pat, what sort of changes would you want to see to Monk to make it fun for you? Not just playable, but actually really fun?
[1:29:36] <%Shonen_hero> I feel bummed about Crystal's reputation. Didn't know about Balmung until my free company mates said they like to visit that world and put on the roleplay only tag to do ERP. Aughhhhhhh D:
[1:29:37] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Other than that, it's just to play a different character without Fantasia
[1:29:37] <heartlesshealer> crazy people and warehouse reasons
[1:29:37] <%AncelDeLambert> I hate that you have to PAY for inventory
[1:29:40] <Klefth> @Calamity2007 Honestly, XI will forever be one of my favorite games of all time, but.... I don't know how worth it would be to go back to it. They've pretty much made it all soloable, though so there's that
[1:29:40] <+WinstonThrasher> another purpose: incognito mode for the grimey side of RP
[1:29:41] <%LaughingCatt> also theres playing on different data centers
[1:29:43] <%krazy_likeafox> which is hard to do if you own both characters
[1:29:45] <%gespenst25> You need two ACCOUNTS for that because you can't be friends with chanracters that aren't ever online together
[1:29:46] <%Shonen_hero> I'm on Goblin
[1:29:47] <figleafplays> these last fights here are great
[1:29:48] <%Chichen> aw ye just won one of dem fall guy
[1:29:51] <%Noelle_of_the_Nova> @PatStaresAt Or you are an rper and like having multiple characters.
[1:29:51] <%Higure_yoru> that doesn't sound 3 dollars extra month worth
[1:29:53] <%cowardman93> the music in this game is fucking great
[1:29:55] <+HelloImTom08> i have alts cause i think its fun to play as other races
[1:30:01] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PatStaresAt It's not like in wow, you can't dirrectly send items to a character you own through mail
[1:30:06] <Calamity2007> @Klefth Yeah I think I just would do it out of curiosity's sake
[1:30:11] <%LegendGHT> Pat do you lapse on your sub when you're not actively playing or do you just always have your sub active?
[1:30:11] <+SH1NK1R0> I use alts to help friends through early game.
[1:30:15] <LilacsandFreedom> I meant datacenter
[1:30:20] <TioXyco> ytou can have characters in all data center if ytou want naturally
[1:30:25] <%penitentpentwitch> The awkwardness of friends on different datacenters
[1:30:26] <BinaryShuffle> Can I join an FC on another server?
[1:30:28] <LilacsandFreedom> world travel is great though
[1:30:42] <Jdrockefeller> it's only between datacenters that you can't jump between
[1:30:42] <%twoto858> Question: are there any companies in this game for players who are new to MMOs in general
[1:30:43] <+SH1NK1R0> Once they get hw i delete the alt
[1:30:44] <BinaryShuffle> fug
[1:30:47] <%krazy_likeafox> @BinaryShuffle Nope, you can join parties from other servers though
[1:30:49] <%MegboyManuel> starbucks lightning is so odd
[1:30:49] <Calamity2007> @BinaryShuffle No you can only join an FC on your world
[1:30:51] <Klefth> @Calamity2007 It's still got a really cool world and a good story. It's just for me, and most old school players I've talked to, the community is kinda what made that game :/
[1:30:54] <LilacsandFreedom> half my friends play on Aether and half of Crystal, it's a struggle
[1:31:02] <90k9> Any chance of playing PS02 from steam?
[1:31:04] <%MegboyManuel> yo that bun girl's hot
[1:31:04] <%afronooch> CBD?
[1:31:08] <+MephioTV> Do you think they'll ever fix Hrothgar and Viera
[1:31:14] <%LegendGHT> Do you still drop by the storm haus to check on the old FC?
[1:31:17] <%Chichen> SAME PAT
[1:31:19] <figleafplays> pso2 is not borked on steam
[1:31:19] <%MegboyManuel> what do you mean "fix"
[1:31:19] <%afronooch> thats what i said manuel
[1:31:22] <JMRboosties> how are they broken
[1:31:24] <figleafplays> its way better on steam
[1:31:25] <%AncelDeLambert> it's boring as fuck, too
[1:31:28] <%RyTYoung> Do you have to pay a sub on PS4? I'm not paying on right now but I'm still under level 60
[1:31:28] <+HitoBeat> Getting a second character in FFXI for storage was such a big thing, they wrote a fun article in their in-universe newsletter doing a pretend interview with someone who was just a storage mule
[1:31:30] <+Ancopro> its on steam now
[1:31:33] <DetroitSentai> Steam
[1:31:37] <%MisterTylerrr> So the WINDOWS STORE is bad, not the game.
[1:31:38] <ElementalX1000> thats all Microsoft
[1:31:38] <%penitentpentwitch> I'm curious if "Save the Queen" will introduce Female Hrothgar
[1:31:38] <%AncelDeLambert> it works okay on Steam, and it's boring as hell
[1:31:41] <%RyTYoung> and I bought the complete edition
[1:31:46] <+gimmickypizza> Windows store bad
[1:31:46] <+Neoripo> Pat GOBLINS. Game is fine now
[1:31:47] <+rovalbar> LUL
[1:31:50] <%KuroStardust> WHAT
[1:31:51] <%AncelDeLambert> ... what the fuck, Windows
[1:31:52] <Calamity2007> Steam fixed it @PatStaresAt
[1:31:53] <%Kyoshikei> you can delete it Pat,
[1:31:53] <figleafplays> its on steam now and it just installs no problem from steam
[1:31:55] <Klefth> @HitoBeat LUL
[1:31:55] <BinaryShuffle> monkaS
[1:31:56] <90k9> Damn
[1:31:59] <2DSuperiority> but free Morgana suit tho
[1:32:00] <ASleepySnek> powershell that shit
[1:32:02] <%Kyoshikei> took me an hr but I got it done
[1:32:03] <@SoFarFetched> yeah but Pat will always think back to that moment
[1:32:08] <@SoFarFetched> and get mad again
[1:32:10] <neVan0> wow LUL
[1:32:12] <%gatoralus> Game bored me to tears on steam
[1:32:15] <%krazy_likeafox> @penitentpentwitch I hope so, I want more intimidating female characters in this game
[1:32:16] <+Ancopro> oh god fuck that folder
[1:32:18] <%angel949> hey pat is the official unofficial patstaresat Fc still recruiting? I was watching the controller setup video where you mentioned it
[1:32:18] <%LegendGHT> I don't hear anyone talking about Male Viera psaBougie
[1:32:18] <%Kyoshikei> You have to change permissions
[1:32:20] <+MephioTV> To delete those you have to change permissions
[1:32:20] <KoyaMusa> is this version of pso2 staggered content or is it up to date with the jp version
[1:32:22] <+SH1NK1R0> Yes you need a sub on ps4 but it doesn't need ps plus
[1:32:23] <+gimmickypizza> Windows bad
[1:32:26] <%Typhaeon> Yeah you need to take ownership of the folder first,
[1:32:28] <StaticSunrise> can we take a moment to laugh at all the male xaela named Darkman Shadowdick who are terrible at the game and Type in perfect syntax like this, all the time.
[1:32:29] <heartlesshealer> NotLikeThis
[1:32:29] <+Samsquanch> had that problem today with flight sim lol
[1:32:31] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah you have to delete that shit using runtime, it's so fucking stupid
[1:32:36] <%KuroStardust> Well. Windows 10 bad
[1:32:37] <+Regigangster> You have to ask Bill Gates for permission to delete it
[1:32:40] <%Jekado> PSO2 is tainted for me too
[1:32:41] <+Neoripo> You totally can, just had to add administrators as a trusted
[1:32:43] <%Raiden_Breaker> classic windows giving sega more power over the user
[1:32:47] <%ChaosAethr> ChaosAethr subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! how do you make friends in this game, I ask because I have not irl friends that ever play games.
[1:32:47] <%MegboyManuel> it totally is
[1:32:48] <%RyTYoung> @sh1nk1r0 I see thanks!
[1:32:48] <%the38bandit> xbox seris x ui makes me not wanna get it
[1:32:49] <%MisterTylerrr> Ok so now it's on steam
[1:32:49] <KohryuZX> there are tutorials on how to gain ownership of that foulder to delete it
[1:32:52] <%Typhaeon> Also PSO2 is as deep as a puddle
[1:32:52] <%Jekado> i think i spent more times installing pso2 then playing pso2
[1:32:55] <scrublord009> I started playing the free trial. I am trying to level up warrior and going through main campaign. I don't feel like I am getting gear or weapons. Should I buy in stores?
[1:32:57] <bapscal> @KoyaMusa they're staggering content and expect to be up to date by like. december or something
[1:32:57] <SummonerMagno> Gracias por el HyperGravity, @chaosaethr.
[1:32:57] <%Kyoshikei> but FUCK WINDOWS STORE honestly
[1:33:01] <BlackOrchidKI> I'd recommend the Tweaker for PSO2
[1:33:01] <%LegendGHT> I played PSO2 on a japanese server years and years ago. Didn't find it that interesting then, definitely don't care now
[1:33:02] <+Neoripo> That is ALL on Microsoft
[1:33:05] <%MegboyManuel> it took mothman a full day to try to install it
[1:33:08] <%angel949> Are you gonna try the new pso2 when it comes out?
[1:33:11] <TurtlesAndTentacles> well now it's on steam so it just seems like you're o
[1:33:15] <Calamity2007> I'm just going to wait for that New Genesis thing
[1:33:19] <TurtlesAndTentacles> only complaining
[1:33:21] <KohryuZX> you need to gain ownership of that foulder away from windows to delete it
[1:33:35] <%weissguard> Big 'ol speech. Itty bitty boss fight.
[1:33:37] <@Velyndra> FF11 stream when
[1:33:37] <%CzeekyPlays> What about BDO2 Kappa
[1:33:59] <Calamity2007> That's understandable
[1:34:03] <%LegendGHT> like 7 lives
[1:34:04] <@SoFarFetched> Pat probably would drop PSO2 anyway
[1:34:09] <@SoFarFetched> so no loss really
[1:34:09] <+HelloImTom08> all of them
[1:34:09] <TioXyco> all of them lives
[1:34:11] <%angel949> All of them
[1:34:11] <Blackjack760> 2 more lives
[1:34:15] <KoyaMusa> i wish ff11 had a good free trial, not the 14 day one. i'd be interested in giving it a try if it had one likf ff14
[1:34:17] <%Jaxnos> don't you play 3 MMOs? so 3 lives.
[1:34:18] <%Shonen_hero> Gaius continues to rattle on unabated
[1:34:19] <Jdrockefeller> all I hear is raiden when Gaius speaks
[1:34:23] <%RyTYoung> @patstaresat Will you be playing Mortal Shell?
[1:34:26] <%LegendGHT> RDM is so much fun
[1:34:29] <Klefth> RDM is the shit
[1:34:33] <SummonerMagno> got prae.. i thank you Pat
[1:34:35] <+HitoBeat> FFXI is free on a private server
[1:34:36] <%MegboyManuel> reminder that Gaius has the same VA as Joseph Joestar
[1:34:39] <DetroitSentai> Black mage slaps
[1:34:42] <+A0N33> RDM is amazing, I love it!
[1:34:45] <commanderapathy> red mage main over here
[1:34:45] <%thegreatbambe> low floor high ceiling
[1:34:47] <Calamity2007> RDM is fun, I don't care if it is not the best DPS
[1:34:49] <+LittleBigQuebec> RDM is a fun dps to play , but dps is not that great
[1:34:49] <%Raiden_Breaker> its utility is god tier for dps
[1:34:51] <aeonicvector> Redmage is a ton of fun, its alot of roles, and it allows you to be a little bit support
[1:34:55] <+MephioTV> RDM is suuuuuper easy to learn
[1:34:56] <%MegboyManuel> BuT mY tOp PaRsE
[1:34:57] <%krazy_likeafox> Rez Mage
[1:34:59] <penitentpentwitch> After level 64
[1:35:00] <+Samsquanch> I'm picture woolie refusing to love halo 2 because mcc had bad multiplayer 6 years ago lol
[1:35:02] <aeonicvector> Redmage can PENTA res if you manage mana well
[1:35:02] <StaticSunrise> no summoner will ever raise ever
[1:35:07] <BluBox> And fly off platforms like a DRG
[1:35:09] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> RDM main here, love the job, most people don't have a problem with the class either
[1:35:10] <TurtlesAndTentacles> FF11 Is still a thing?
[1:35:15] <Klefth> Hell yeah, I only run 24 mans as RDM because fuck people
[1:35:16] <+pandamancer224> and the resing is fast due to double cast
[1:35:20] <EnderGamma> RDM is better since they also aren't reliant on Swiftcast
[1:35:20] <+SH1NK1R0> Gnb is my jam man. Super skeptical at launch and now i cant not play it
[1:35:22] <commanderapathy> not for healers it isn't
[1:35:24] <SummonerMagno> im summ i raise a lot
[1:35:24] <%SpcOpsBear> Imagine being me and actually being interested in two MMOs at once, except one of them is PlanetSide 2 so I don't -have- to pay to play that shit *and then I still do for a month*.
[1:35:25] <%apostateCourier> also raids.
[1:35:26] <2DSuperiority> Play Red Mage, because your healers are most likely bad
[1:35:27] <+LittleBigQuebec> they have to best raise in the game with their passive for sure
[1:35:27] <%Shonen_hero> Now I know which job to pick up next. Right now I'm leveling BLM and MNK
[1:35:29] <%weissguard> Now watch Gaius go Hyper Mode.
[1:35:30] <+HitoBeat> FFXI just got more story content
[1:35:30] <%RyTYoung> Yeah it's so sick

[1:35:35] <DetroitSentai> FF11 got new scenario content this month @TurtlesAndTentacles
[1:35:37] <aeonicvector> As a red, i got to 5.3sEX by carrying 4 of my team back from the grave ALOT
[1:35:38] <%apostateCourier> Like, I've gone from me alive to the whole raid on their feet in like 15 seconds
[1:35:38] <%Aleate> We only cleared the new Trial on my first time because I Verraised my party easily 15 times
[1:35:42] <%krazy_likeafox> i did a puppet bunker run with 7 RDM and yyyyeah that battle res was Needed
[1:35:45] <Calamity2007> @pandamancer224 Oh cool I thought Duelcast didn't affect res
[1:35:46] <%Valdorick> OwO?

[1:37:14] <StaticSunrise> it's gonna be HSEX holy see extreme
[1:37:15] <BluBox> Don't worry about it
[1:37:15] <%Aleate> Neo-Ultimate Theoden. aka NUT
[1:37:15] <BinaryShuffle> Whatever Freeza did
[1:37:15] <aeonicvector> @LegendGHT Those are 8 mans, 24 mans are usually the casual ones
[1:37:17] <HarpuiaRivers> Didn't you know???
[1:37:17] <DetroitSentai> @LegendGHT No ultimates are super high end 8 mans, there are only 3 so far
[1:37:17] <+pandamancer224> @Calamity2007 it totally works for res. you usually cast cure for 1.5 sec and then insta res
[1:37:17] <%debugdrawray_> @LegendGHT yes, theres usually 3 per expac
[1:37:18] <%MegboyManuel> Super Saiyan
[1:37:20] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> The good thing about Garlemald being the next expansion, is that we'll finally get this fucker's armor
[1:37:22] <%MegboyManuel> Glamour
[1:37:25] <UBERsheep> SSJ obviously
[1:37:25] <kozboz96> itll be explained in 6.0

[1:37:26] <%Rumbutt> Gaius used 50 rings and the chaos emeralds to become Super Gaius
[1:37:30] <%MisterTylerrr> Apparently Gold armor absorbs Aether?
[1:37:30] <MKII> thordan's rage ultimate TRUUUUUU
[1:37:33] <floatRand> Why does Bahamut turn gold? Dunno
[1:37:34] <+trizetacannon44> Thanks for the HyperMine @baddadkuma
[1:37:34] <Klefth> I could see them doing that
[1:37:35] <+miguelrod777> anti mage armor it's semi explained in the golden magitek mount
[1:37:36] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> Super Garlear God Super Garrlean obviously
[1:37:39] <%LegendGHT> hmm maybe I should run UWU
[1:37:39] <+theenigmaticdude> he has the chaos emeralds
[1:37:41] <Reireizei> It's explained in the Golden Magitek Mount text @PatStaresAt the gold color is a magic reflector ability
[1:37:48] <%BIumen> it foreshadows the 6.0 class
[1:37:51] <ElbyBoxus> is his sword a gun
[1:37:52] <HarpuiaRivers> Gaius remembered he had to mamaruu
[1:37:53] <WeebFever> look at that big nerd juking and jiving
[1:37:56] <+Neoripo> Garlean BS
[1:37:57] <+Nickster711> I just started getting back into this after a long break. Thoughts on top classes right now in their roles? Havent decided what role to main yet.
[1:37:57] <%reonome> wow pat looks like a jackass with those weapons
[1:37:59] <floatRand> It's shitty rflector for certain
[1:38:01] <HarpuiaRivers> and turned golden
[1:38:02] <%SpcOpsBear> All he does is Oversoul
[1:38:07] <KoyaMusa> now, how the fuck does gaius cover his armor in it then
[1:38:08] <+ALazo> no his gun is a sword
[1:38:12] <%debugdrawray_> can you do either of the castrums synced?
[1:38:12] <%krazy_likeafox> @ElbyBoxus yes. there's a lot of those in this game.
[1:38:12] <aeonicvector> Given the amount of magical damage this normal ass guy has eaten, it TOTALLY does
[1:38:16] <+MephioTV> pls be geomancer
[1:38:18] <Klefth> Y'all see that new town after the G-warrior fight? Man, I hope they make that a new city in 6.0!
[1:38:21] <StaticSunrise> chemist for sure
[1:38:23] <%Mr_Pylon> and the bad guy calmy walked away
[1:38:23] <%penitentpentwitch> Judge and Apothecary!
[1:38:23] <aeonicvector> Chemist and Judge (armored DPS)are my hopes
[1:38:24] <Reireizei> Chemist please :D
[1:38:25] <%the22cstomp> healer better be alchemist
[1:38:25] <commanderapathy> necromancer
[1:38:26] <TioXyco> it's gonna be chemist and a ranged
[1:38:27] <%Typhaeon> Geomancer
[1:38:28] <+Neoripo> Apothecary
[1:38:28] <%the22cstomp> chemist rather
[1:38:29] <DetroitSentai> Potion healer is all but confirmed
[1:38:29] <ManfredA> healer and a caster most likely
[1:38:32] <%valriot> YEYEYE CHEMIST
[1:38:34] <%MegboyManuel> CHEMIST
[1:38:35] <+HitoBeat> Chemist is a meme
[1:38:35] <%MisterTylerrr> LONGSWORD DPS PLZ FUCK YOU
[1:38:37] <%Rumbutt> It's gonna be Chemist
[1:38:37] <%LegendGHT> I was trying to beat the Good King Mog Extreme and it's super hard. any advice?
[1:38:37] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> arithmetician
[1:38:37] <%weissguard> SMASH Potions in the FACE
[1:38:39] <%Typhaeon> Arithmetician
[1:38:39] <bapscal> god i really do want a dps that uses a big fuck off hammer, honestly
[1:38:41] <%LaughingCatt> Chemist pls
[1:38:41] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> they seemed to hint at it in 5.3
[1:38:42] <BinaryShuffle> I just want my original cards back as Ast FeelsBadMan
[1:38:42] <+UberWolfman> CHEMIST and Puppet Master Puppet Kappa
[1:38:43] <%Rumbutt> they basically called it out
[1:38:43] <floatRand> Cheemiiiiist
[1:38:43] <%krazy_likeafox> chemist / time mage / geomancer lets GOOOO
[1:38:45] <%Valdorick> Chemist and Calculator
[1:38:45] <Animorphimagi> just got here....why no camera again...
[1:38:46] <%AncelDeLambert> I'd do chemist more if it wasn't just cooking lite
[1:38:46] <HarpuiaRivers> Chemist will be Potion I, Potion II, Potion III, then GUN for their dps
[1:38:47] <+metal_gearxxx> I WANT JUDGE
[1:38:48] <%apostateCourier> +1 for Chemist
[1:38:48] <+SH1NK1R0> We need a 4th healer
[1:38:49] <@Velyndra> puppetmaster
[1:38:49] <KoyaMusa> if its like themed as a garlean medic maybe
[1:38:51] <%AncelDeLambert> needs SO MUCH FUCKING INVENTORY SPACE
[1:38:56] <%LaughingCatt> Give me a grenade launcher to shoot potions at peopls faces
[1:38:56] <aeonicvector> Yeee!
[1:38:56] <vVAstrAVv> ppl are thinking necro cus of that heroes boss
[1:38:58] <%LegendGHT> judge character would be sick
[1:38:58] <EvanDude47> ranged melee healer
[1:38:58] <floatRand> JUDGE
[1:38:59] <Calamity2007> Chemist and Necromancer
[1:38:59] <+Neoripo> Chemist for sure
[1:39:01] <EvanDude47> chemist
[1:39:02] <ManfredA> it won't be a melee
[1:39:02] <%Valdorick> Boo, more melee
[1:39:04] <floatRand> YOU GET RED CARD
[1:39:04] <%BIumen> nero's gunhammer iron man suit as a class
[1:39:05] <%SwdVengeance> Not Necromancer?
[1:39:07] <commanderapathy> beastmaster
[1:39:07] <Daxalog> Yeah you kept saying you wanted to pelt potions into people faces
[1:39:07] <%mikessdd> Yeah they really should add another healer.
[1:39:07] <%AncelDeLambert> ah, THAT chemist
[1:39:09] <DetroitSentai> I dont think we're getting judge, gunbreaker is very similar
[1:39:09] <%penitentpentwitch> Probably a rocket hammer Judge
[1:39:10] <+ALazo> Would be nice to have that shared
[1:39:10] <KoyaMusa> maiming set and twin swords?
[1:39:10] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> dual swords gabranth style
[1:39:10] <Klefth> That would be nice
[1:39:11] <%valriot> RIP ninja LUL
[1:39:12] <%LegendGHT> Necromancer would also be sick
[1:39:12] <%SpcOpsBear> Chemist and Necro please
[1:39:14] <ManfredA> it'll be a caster for sure
[1:39:14] <%Typhaeon> Melee/caster hybrid please
[1:39:14] <Blackjack760> probably caster
[1:39:17] <floatRand> GO TO GAY BABY JAIL
[1:39:18] <ASleepySnek> 5 melees
[1:39:18] <%mikessdd> Tanks are rounded out good right now.
[1:39:19] <TioXyco> considering 5.3 MSQ, Chemist is pretty much confirmed.
[1:39:24] <DetroitSentai> GOnna be a scythe character based on ranjit
[1:39:26] <BluBox> I would think caster
[1:39:26] <%LegendGHT> I was trying to beat the Good King Mog Extreme and it's super hard. any advice?
[1:39:26] <bapscal> actually another maiming dps would be awesome! sometimes as a dps i just wanna look a little chunkier and heavier
[1:39:27] <%Shonen_hero> I wonder if chemist would pair well with alchemist
[1:39:31] <%the22cstomp> there's already a melee caster hybrid
[1:39:33] <%AncelDeLambert> it'd be a little cool if there were combat jobs that got a bonus from levels in a crafting job
[1:39:34] <fug74> Green mage with a mace
[1:39:37] <%marsantas> Probably ranged dps. it's the only dps that doesn't have 4
[1:39:39] <skyheys> just like how DNC uses Scouting Kappa
[1:39:40] <%CzeekyPlays> @Typhaeon isn't that just red mage?
[1:39:40] <KoyaMusa> i don't think we can have playable necromancer, this game's themes commonly say death magic bad
[1:39:40] <Calamity2007> @DetroitSentai I'm up for that
[1:39:41] <%MugenSandan> going by your theory, Runeblade then
[1:39:42] <+SinisterBroccoli> I've been wanting a Puppeteer class that's a long range tank class
[1:39:42] <2DSuperiority> Rune Fencer is like that but they use great swords like DRK
[1:39:44] <%MisterTylerrr> Long..sword...dps..gimme
[1:39:45] <+HitoBeat> DRK should have had scythes
[1:39:47] <kozboz96> time mage caster?
[1:39:50] <%krazy_likeafox> i have run prae so many times and i have never figured out how gaius gets up there so fast
[1:39:50] <@spacecapncrone> It'd be cool to have the weird Garlean attacks- like that X beam they all use.
[1:39:50] <%mikessdd> Red mage is that already
[1:39:53] <%thegreatbambe> melee caster hybrid? You mean RDM?
[1:39:55] <MKII> garlean's cant sue magic
[1:39:55] <+TheDestinyPotato> i want a healer that heals via dps like wow disc priest
[1:39:56] <%LaughingCatt> having a hybrid dps would be awesome, like a caster/melee hybrid
[1:39:56] <+MephioTV> Judge would be cool! I could also see them adding Geomancer
[1:39:57] <kirin53> how much dps should a 480 mnk be doing? when i do stone sky sea i average around 14k but dont really have a comparison
[1:39:57] <%Typhaeon> No, Red Mage doesn't have enough melee interactions to qualify.
[1:40:00] <BluBox> Arithmetician lol
[1:40:01] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> I just wipe for the Second time Castrum Meridianum
[1:40:02] <kozboz96> yeah caster only has 3
[1:40:02] <aeonicvector> Magical has 3.3, cause Blue is also a tank and healer
[1:40:02] <TioXyco> what about BLU? Kappa
[1:40:03] <cascadepersona> Ranged DPS and another Healer?
[1:40:04] <%marsantas> Blue is on the list even if you don't like it
[1:40:05] <skyheys> BLU Kappa
[1:40:06] <Klefth> Hot take here, but I REALLY wish RDM didn't share gear with BLM and SMN. We barely get any fancy gear that fits the RDM aesthetic. Enough with the pointy hats and robes T_T
[1:40:07] <ManfredA> RDM is a caster with a melee combo
[1:40:08] <+UberWolfman> BLUE MAGE WHO? KAppa
[1:40:08] <@Velyndra> Judge is actually puppetmaster just garlean themed
[1:40:08] <%SomeSageAdvice> except Yoshi P considers Blu to be part of casting, so to him its 4
[1:40:09] <DianaTheAscian> melee healer would be cool but idk how that would work and it might be bad even
[1:40:10] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> math class
[1:40:10] <+ALazo> BLU is a minigame
[1:40:12] <ManfredA> not a hybrid
[1:40:12] <%Arxel1> LUL
[1:40:16] <%krazy_likeafox> @OfficioPrefectusCorgi F
[1:40:18] <ygtidal> is gunbreaker any fun?
[1:40:19] <skyheys> It's on the list Kappa
[1:40:20] <+Berb64> Magic/Melee
[1:40:22] <+Neoripo> Make BLU a real class
[1:40:23] <2DSuperiority> and we had phy ranged for the last two expansions
[1:40:27] <%Shonen_hero> Next you'll say you postal delivery rank is useless Kappa
[1:40:29] <Calamity2007> BLU was a mistake
[1:40:30] <aeonicvector> If its a melee, just make it a cool one
[1:40:32] <%LaughingCatt> Red Mage is on the right track but doesnt have enough melee stuff to qualify
[1:40:33] <%MugenSandan> I WONT BE
[1:40:33] <%SomeSageAdvice> its super fun @ygtidal
[1:40:33] <%marsantas> Melee makes everyone mad and smelly
[1:40:36] <ManfredA> so DRG
[1:40:37] <ASleepySnek> you mean ninja
[1:40:38] <BinaryShuffle> YE YE YE
[1:40:39] <Blackjack760> oh god no
[1:40:40] <floatRand> I don't mind. Either something that shares NIN or DRG gear.
[1:40:40] <KoyaMusa> does the melee support you with boops
[1:40:41] <%LaughingCatt> that be sweet
[1:40:41] <%angel949> Punch to heal
[1:40:41] <ASleepySnek> and drg
[1:40:42] <%Valdorick> But there's ALREADY 4 melee
[1:40:43] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> onion knight
[1:40:44] <%MisterTylerrr> Cleric then?
[1:40:46] <+azure22900> Why not a hybrid like Red mage? Melee with a mix of range
[1:40:46] <%MugenSandan> dragoon and samurai LOUD AND PROUD
[1:40:48] <BluBox> I'd be okay with a new maiming or scouting melee class
[1:40:48] <+HitoBeat> Viking
[1:40:49] <%weissguard> Is one of the other players a convenience store employee?
[1:40:50] <%mikessdd> GNB plays like a DPS class but it’s a tank. So yeah it’s fun.
[1:40:50] <DetroitSentai> Chemist is pretty much confirmed at least, which seems cool
[1:40:51] <%Typhaeon> RDM has one gimmick melee combo you execute then retreat with
[1:40:52] <skyheys> NIN already exists
[1:40:53] <%kenstank> I want it to be one that shares gearsets with either Ninja or Dragoon because mind goblins
[1:40:54] <%SpcOpsBear> So Rune Knight?
[1:40:55] <%penitentpentwitch> Judge Card Buffs!
[1:40:57] <+SH1NK1R0> Gnb is tons of fun. It also starts at 60
[1:40:57] <+cythegaeta> People I follow are saying Chemist and possibly Necromancer
[1:40:59] <2DSuperiority> Disciple of Meme
[1:40:59] <%BIumen> What about Nero's iron man suit as a class?
[1:41:02] <Animorphimagi> yeah ninja
[1:41:02] <%LegendGHT> I was trying to beat the Good King Mog Extreme and it's super hard. any advice?
[1:41:03] <Vengie14> AST with a sword
[1:41:13] <BluBox> This gear monopoly needs to stop
[1:41:14] <%SpcOpsBear> So Puppetmaster?
[1:41:17] <@spacecapncrone> Nin and Dnc should share gear, honestly.
[1:41:29] <skyheys> Or just reuse NIN gear
[1:41:29] <%krazy_likeafox> BLU has it's uses. And that use being cheesing lookout points.
[1:41:29] <+pandamancer224> what about a polearm?
[1:41:29] <%wjones0415> yeah, right now magical, ranged and healer have 3.
[1:41:30] <DetroitSentai> Neroes hammer just needs to be a WAR glam
[1:41:31] <%kenstank> I want. a scythe...
[1:41:31] <%LaughingCatt> hammer hammer hammer hammer hammer
[1:41:34] <skyheys> on a mage knight
[1:41:36] <+Arkfyre> I'd love a big mace dps
[1:41:40] <KoyaMusa> we are missing a lot of scimitars in this game
[1:41:43] <%Ciglossonjr> SAM should've shared gear with DRG
[1:41:44] <%CzeekyPlays> Fuck I would love some dual wielding that isn't pansy ass daggers or fist weapons
[1:41:49] <DetroitSentai> Yeah it's the shitty dorf one
[1:41:50] <%terminallyCapriciousz> can we get a dual wieldy STR dps please thanks
[1:41:54] <+Everdarke> There's also DRK "sword" that is a club
[1:41:54] <@spacecapncrone> add a scythe job so I can always have a job to single out in pvp
[1:42:00] <Orange_Kake> I cant wait for the yokai watch class!
[1:42:09] <@CreepyPorpoise> PUP
[1:42:12] <%krazy_likeafox> I would high key love a gear set that's garlean themed. Like casters get Emet
[1:42:13] <2DSuperiority> but Dragoon is so iconic they have to have their own stuff - some guy at Square
[1:42:15] <%CzeekyPlays> @terminallyCapriciousz yes plz
[1:42:19] <%LaughingCatt> theres also the Dark Knight pvp club
[1:42:19] <DetroitSentai> I makes me upset, same with the dwarf armor because it's so close to letting me do a Vivi/black mage glamour but i dont want beard
[1:42:21] <skyheys> @orange_kake You mean Necro Kappa
[1:42:21] <%krazy_likeafox> *emet's outfit and tanks get gaius's
[1:42:25] <Calamity2007> @terminallyCapriciousz What does NIN scale with?
[1:42:25] <BluBox> Berserker, two small axes, maiming (won't happen but would be cool)
[1:42:26] <%Typhaeon> It's pretty hard to think up unique class abilities to be honest
[1:42:28] <ScreamLord> So I looked up the FF14 OST and why is ALL the music so awesome? The Twinning slaps so hard!
[1:42:30] <Klefth> I really wish RDM had unique gear
[1:42:31] <%kenstank> how would beastmaster play tho??
[1:42:31] <StaticSunrise> SAM should have been a tank and GNB should have been dps
[1:42:41] <%MugenSandan> what's the worst possible job that isn't blue mage they could add?
[1:42:42] <DetroitSentai> Mad
[1:42:45] <Shonen_hero> Could be
[1:42:46] <%valriot> Id fucking riot
[1:42:47] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @calamity2007 Dexterity.
[1:42:47] <%kenstank> I would be so mad
[1:42:47] <+UberWolfman> RIOT
[1:42:50] <+azure22900> That'd suck
[1:42:50] <+blastazoid26> we need another healer for sure
[1:42:51] <Orange_Kake> gross
[1:42:52] <+SH1NK1R0> No
[1:42:52] <%marsantas> Chemist dps and geomancer healer
[1:42:52] <DetroitSentai> They need a 4th healer
[1:42:53] <+Neoripo> Pls NO
[1:42:55] <+MephioTV> I could see Geomancer being a stance-dancing caster that changes elements and does different shiz with each
[1:42:59] <@CreepyPorpoise> "we don't know how to balance 4 healing classes."
[1:42:59] <heartlesshealer> Samurai is not a tank
[1:42:59] <%Shonen_hero> COuld like throw alchemical acid or fire
[1:43:00] <ManfredA> that guy played XI
[1:43:01] <%Tenkay> Chemist and Magic Knight would be cool
[1:43:01] <+DormaKazzy> I am the only one who screamed for RDM to be a tank
[1:43:02] <%the22cstomp> chemist dps, judge healer
[1:43:03] <@CreepyPorpoise> *its fine*
[1:43:04] <cascadepersona> Is there any Time Mage-esque Job in XIV yet?
[1:43:07] <ManfredA> SAM was a tank in XIV
[1:43:09] <ManfredA> *XI
[1:43:09] <+azure22900> A status effecting healer would be cool for chemist
[1:43:10] <skyheys> SAMURAI IS A TANK IN MOST FFS
[1:43:13] <floatRand> COULD HIS POWER BE SO GREAT?
[1:43:14] <%LandOfTheWay> chemist should be healer, but i still wanna throw acid in someone's face
[1:43:18] <%LaughingCatt> we already got Machinist because they changed Chemist to a dps, dont do it again
[1:43:19] <%Ciglossonjr> We already see characters with geomancer bells
[1:43:21] <%Shockrates20XX> But they'd have a totally different stance.
[1:43:23] <BluBox> SAM was a tank in 11 but then again NIN was also used as a tank in some cases
[1:43:23] <SomersaultJustice> samurai had dodgy stuff
[1:43:25] <+Neoripo> Make Gundam a real mount
[1:43:27] <%walternatorz> @PatStaresAt how many runs of prae do you think you've done?
[1:43:29] <+zevitunez> Isn't onion knight a thing in ff games?
[1:43:30] <%mikessdd> Hell NIN is a tank in XI lol
[1:43:32] <%marsantas> Dream mage when!
[1:43:36] <%AncelDeLambert> no, in most Final Fantasy the samurai is the insta-kill character
[1:43:37] <DetroitSentai> Astro steals the flavor of time mage and gambler
[1:43:38] <ManfredA> Astrologian's time magic got taken out
[1:43:41] <Klefth> No it wasn't. You COULD ghetto tank as SAM sometimes, but the tanks were PLD and NIN @ManfredA
[1:43:41] <cyclone722> astro gutted
[1:43:45] <%Shonen_hero> my god that's a lot
[1:43:46] <%weissguard> Garlic Lahabread! nintFlan nintFlan
[1:43:50] <%wjones0415> that would be horrible!
[1:43:51] <+SpcOpsBear> I want a healer with "vitae" heals
[1:43:52] <%mikessdd> And NIN being a tank was a fucking mistake
[1:43:53] <%Typhaeon> Coffee with lahabreead
[1:43:55] <%Shonen_hero> my time in Prae is a pittance in comparison
[1:43:57] <%apostateCourier> clearly if we were getting a hammer job it would have been this expac, what with Gaia and her hammer of darkness :v
[1:43:58] <%wjones0415> SAM was a tank in 11
[1:44:00] <+Neoripo> At least 1 per day
[1:44:01] <%SpcOpsBear> Small DoT stacks you can consume for higher direct heals
[1:44:04] <%LaughingCatt> SAM was much more of a dps in 11, its parry skills werent super effective at tanking & it could skill chain like a boss
[1:44:05] <%SpcOpsBear> hoT*
[1:44:05] <%krazy_likeafox> Lahabread 'bout to be Lahatoast
[1:44:06] <cascadepersona> I wonder if they took Time magic out for later, or just thought it was too good.
[1:44:08] <%angel949> so that's whet he looks like
[1:44:14] <Calamity2007> @Neoripo I'm sure it will be eventually. Probably for clearing all the Weapon raids on extreme
[1:44:17] <+LittleBigQuebec> oh look, it's Lahabrea, the least interesting ascian
[1:44:20] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> The Astro story sets Astro to be time mage like, but the skills no longer reflect that
[1:44:20] <floatRand> Although dunno what sort of healing identity chemist would have. I have ideas how the gameplay could work (basically mixing chemicals), but would they be more shield/direct/regen healer? Buffs? Debuffing?
[1:44:25] <+zevitunez> It's gonna be ONION KNIGHT
[1:44:29] <DetroitSentai> @apostateCourier they already gave war that one hammer, so the might as well just let more axes have hammer models
[1:44:30] <floatRand> Debuffing healer could be neat actually thematically
[1:44:33] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> you are moldy bread, laha
[1:44:40] <+Neoripo> @Calamity2007 It's so cool
[1:44:40] <ManfredA> they should break out of the shield/regen dichotomy
[1:44:41] <+yourspecialfriend562> Messed around with paladin?
[1:44:41] <%Shonen_hero> Onion Knight would be rad
[1:44:46] <%kenstank> Lahabrea is like the Ringo Starr of the Ascians
[1:44:47] <ManfredA> it's self-enforced
[1:44:48] <%krazy_likeafox> okay going into aliance roulette bc they have a DPS need, prayer circle I don't get WoD again
[1:44:48] <+azure22900> Beasttamer
[1:44:56] <ManfredA> CHOCOBO KNIGHT
[1:44:56] <floatRand> Necromancer
[1:44:57] <heartlesshealer> Yeah rune fencers are red mage
[1:44:59] <%Aleate> What about a Time Mage? otzHmm
[1:45:00] <ManfredA> ADD CHOCOBO KNIGHT
[1:45:02] <%Shockrates20XX> 6.0 will be Apothecary and Beastmaster.
[1:45:03] <skyheys> Corsair was gonna be a class in 1.0
[1:45:04] <Orange_Kake> blue mage as a real class would be sick
[1:45:05] <SpookyBeef7> Chemist seems to be getting teased for sure. Not sure how Judge would be implemented.
[1:45:05] <2DSuperiority> JUDGEBREAKER
[1:45:11] <%SomeSageAdvice> i so badly want Green Mage just for the hammers/maces
[1:45:16] <DetroitSentai> Judge shares a lot of identity with gbn
[1:45:17] <Daxalog> Chemist abilities will get thrown in with another class. Like Mathametician
[1:45:22] <%LaughingCatt> Corsair used dice rather than cards, & we need a dual gunner like Merlwyb. definetly viable
[1:45:23] <Solokaldaka> stripHi chat
[1:45:24] <SpookyBeef7> Still holding out hope for Geomancer.
[1:45:27] <%terminallyCapriciousz> judge for MDPS with two swords please
[1:45:27] <Reireizei> Judge Dread :D
[1:45:29] <cascadepersona> Rooting for Chemist
[1:45:31] <+Ilpala> YoshiP's gonna do a fanfest wearing a breaking bad shirt
[1:45:31] <TioXyco> Riqi-Tio pretty much scream "CHEMIST"
[1:45:31] <CyborgAV> I WORE A SPIDER MAN SHIRT
[1:45:31] <%weissguard> LUL That sounds great.
[1:45:31] <BluBox> I don't even know what judge would be
[1:45:32] <+Neoripo> Judge changing the rules of the trial
[1:45:34] <heartlesshealer> Calculator
[1:45:35] <ManfredA> Calculator/Mathematician already exists
[1:45:36] <BinaryShuffle> @Solokaldaka stripHi
[1:45:38] <CyborgAV> CAUSE IT WAS DIRECTED BY SAM RAIMI
[1:45:43] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:45:44] <%BIumen> nice
[1:45:46] <%valriot> LUL YEAH
[1:45:50] <%the22cstomp> that's actually what he would do

[1:45:52] <neVan0> LUL
[1:45:52] <TioXyco> either that or a Judge Dread shirt

[1:45:55] <%LaughingCatt> SAM RAIMI
[1:45:57] <+TheBigO75> bruh
[1:45:59] <%weissguard> J-J-Judge. J-J-Judge. *raps*
[1:46:00] <LadyRarityV> LUL LUL
[1:46:05] <+crazyspartan214> bruh
[1:46:08] <DetroitSentai> The sam rami cut was so easy, made way more sense than the Blu mage because spider powers
[1:46:10] <Jdrockefeller> unleash ultima
[1:46:15] <%the22cstomp> it was great pat and you know that
[1:46:15] <%Aleate> Fresh-Prince the new Tank Class confirmed PogChamp
[1:46:17] <%TheGreatSkenardo> I just got here what's up with this edgelord
[1:46:17] <+Regigangster> Expectations subverted :)
[1:46:19] <%BIumen> SUCH
[1:46:22] <commanderapathy> that is a wild leap for a class reveal
[1:46:23] <%weissguard> psaDogchamp
[1:46:26] <%Shockrates20XX> 6.0 is going to have a TIMESKIP in The First to introduce Apothecary Riqi Tio and Hot Adult Gunbreaker Ryne.
[1:46:28] <SlimeSlimeSlime> We were all born in West Phili yo
[1:46:33] <floatRand> SUCH DEVASTATION... THIS WAS NOT MY INTENT.
[1:46:34] <%SpcOpsBear> Chemist will be teased with a Breaking Bad T-shirt
[1:46:35] <$apolitenoob> SUCH DEVASTATION
[1:46:37] <+pandamancer224> what about magic knight?
[1:46:38] <%LaughingCatt> was this your intention Gaius
[1:46:38] <%walternatorz> SUCH DEVESTATION
[1:46:38] <SomersaultJustice> does judge have a move where they toss the enemy like jazz
[1:46:39] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> SUCH D E V A S T A T I O N
[1:46:39] <shinji_ifrit> SUCH DEVASTATION
[1:46:40] <%the22cstomp> SUCH DEVASTATION
[1:46:41] <@SoFarFetched> LAHABREAD
[1:46:41] <Dieworc> SUCH DEVESTATION!!!
[1:46:42] <+ALazo> YAAAAAAAAAY
[1:46:43] <%Raiden_Breaker> SAY THE LINE
[1:46:45] <%weissguard> OOH, that Viera looks really nice.
[1:46:45] <Klefth> THIS WAS NOT MY INTENTION
[1:46:47] <%Typhaeon> Eyyyy
[1:46:48] <%afronooch> NOT MY INTENTION
[1:46:48] <%Shonen_hero> such menstruation
[1:46:50] <+Regigangster> Clap
[1:46:50] <+gumballwizard> the meme line
[1:46:52] <BinaryShuffle> CLAP
[1:46:53] <%apostateCourier> yaaaaay
[1:46:53] <DianaTheAscian> YAY HE SAID THE THING
[1:46:54] <%Raiden_Breaker> NICE
[1:46:54] <%thegreatbambe> YAY!!!
[1:46:55] <Meta_Outhorii> Mah Intention!
[1:46:55] <heartlesshealer> Imagine if they tried Mime as another limited class
[1:46:56] <%Arxel1> SUCH DEVASTATION
[1:46:58] <+Tophatlass> I CLAPPED WHEN I HEARD IT
[1:46:59] <SpookyBeef7> Say the line Richard Epcar!
[1:46:59] <LadyRarityV> SourPls
[1:46:59] <+crazyspartan214> clap
[1:47:02] <ManfredA> my FC latched onto PATHEEEETIC
[1:47:04] <neVan0> YEEEEEEAH
[1:47:04] <%the22cstomp> because it's particularly hammy
[1:47:06] <+Ilpala> it's the godawful delivery
[1:47:07] <%walternatorz> THIS WAS NOT MY INTENTION
[1:47:09] <+Neoripo> I like Laha's PATHETIC more
[1:47:09] <%afronooch> ASCIAN gets me the most
[1:47:10] <%weissguard> SUCH DEVASTATION quiettAh
[1:47:10] <%kenstank> bro I'd be so fucking hype for a Shipudden timeskip
[1:47:10] <Xenstroke> I mean we latched onto Sloppy
[1:47:11] <skyheys> That sure is a dramatic way to say "HOLY SHIT"
[1:47:13] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt cause he says that while hes in a super weapon
[1:47:14] <+ALazo> It's a random ass rhyme on top of everything
[1:47:14] <%Raiden_Breaker> somewhat rhymes
[1:47:16] <floatRand> This whole thing is so delightfully camp and outdated.
[1:47:16] <Xenstroke> so....
[1:47:17] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> That Taco Bell, Gaius video is amazing
[1:47:20] <Klefth> Because it's so dumb and with such over the top enunciation
[1:47:20] <+WinstonThrasher> im a fan of creeping mendacity myself
[1:47:21] <+metal_gearxxx> Elidibus is great in 5.3 though
[1:47:22] <%krazy_likeafox> that green thing has driven me crazy for YEARS
[1:47:25] <%BIumen> green?
[1:47:30] <zenanon> Gaius is daddy
[1:47:30] <%Alaster101> Alaster101 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 11 month streak! glad to be alone for this ride you ginger nerd, you and woolie on the podcast is about the only thing i look forward to these days
[1:47:31] <%BIumen> oh
[1:47:34] <@spacecapncrone> UFO
[1:47:34] <Jdrockefeller> oh I wondered what that dumb green thing was
[1:47:36] <+Tophatlass> Crazy Lahabrea is sadder in context
[1:47:37] <shinji_ifrit> OH GOD
[1:47:40] <+Malacious> LUL
[1:47:40] <+Sushi2k> So I'm starting to play again cause of Pat talking about it. I'm starting completely fresh though since its been awhile. What server we on?
[1:47:43] <floatRand> Now for EXTREME CAMERA PANS
[1:47:47] <zenanon> i can't unsee it
[1:47:49] <%penitentpentwitch> Judge: "I changed the rules, pray I don't change them further!"
[1:47:49] <StaticSunrise> Thanks for the HyperReveal @alaster101
[1:47:51] <+dujam> DUDE I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WAS A BUG ON MY GAME
[1:47:53] <+dujam> WTF
[1:47:58] <+ImmaterialHero> The aetherical burst yeah it's really funny
[1:48:05] <Jdrockefeller> nah I see that all the time too
[1:48:07] <DianaTheAscian> THATS WHAT THAT IS!?
[1:48:10] <%Typhaeon> Boy this MSQ has gone places since 2.0
[1:48:10] <kumasbear> how did i literally never notice this, what the fuck
[1:48:11] <%BIumen> they cut the sylph quet but really couldnt touch this scene up
[1:48:19] <2DSuperiority> the bread is baked
[1:48:20] <+WinstonThrasher> its gaius's fart that squeezed out when ultima went off
[1:48:24] <Jdrockefeller> they can't
[1:48:25] <+Neoripo> @PatStaresAt have you run this with a bunch of monks? the sound is unbearable
[1:48:26] <+ALazo> I always thought it was supposed to be Hydaelin video effect
[1:48:31] <Jdrockefeller> it's part of the dungeon
[1:48:42] <%TheGreatSkenardo> wtf is Bootshine
[1:48:42] <DarkCloud79> I missed devastation
[1:48:48] <zenanon> this fight is so nothing
[1:48:48] <DetroitSentai> @BIumen they plan on reworking prea and castrum in the future
[1:48:50] <Jdrockefeller> and they said that they are leaving as is until they can just completely redo the two last dungeons
[1:48:52] <%LaughingCatt> yeah but phase 2 can actually kill people
[1:48:53] <%Shonen_hero> this dungeon has been memed from the heavens to the seven hells
[1:48:57] <%the22cstomp> min ilvl run
[1:49:00] <KoyaMusa> just get stuck into minstrel's ballad on mentor roulette with newbies
[1:49:02] <%Shockrates20XX> It's stupid that Ultima Phase 2 is the final boss because Laha gets melted likea bitch.
[1:49:08] <%weissguard> Yo who's got the butter for this Garlic Lahabread?
[1:49:18] <%the22cstomp> proto ultima goes down like a bitch too though
[1:49:23] <CyborgAV> You can hear the best version in Ruby Weapon
[1:49:27] <floatRand> To be honest this whole instance should have been made into solo-duty in 5.3 - would make more sense story-wise too. Although dunno what they'd do with voice acting. The new instance should be replayable too by players who have done old one...
[1:49:30] <%SpcOpsBear> Watch the new DPS class be a total swerve and it's Viking
[1:49:37] <%SpcOpsBear> But that they're basically just the same as a Judge
[1:49:37] <dundunsun> Did he already do msq?
[1:49:44] <zenanon> Uh!
[1:49:51] <ManfredA> PAAAAATHETIC
[1:49:59] <zenanon> Ink Mage
[1:50:03] <KoyaMusa> too much overlap
[1:50:04] <%Tenkay> INK MAGE
[1:50:08] <StaticSunrise> berserker is just warrior if you didn't do the job quests
[1:50:12] <@spacecapncrone> the "Basically classes you already have" parade
[1:50:14] <+ImmaterialHero> Clearly we're getting Ascended Classes next expac
[1:50:14] <zenanon> INK MAGE
[1:50:15] <Jdrockefeller> the spectral berserker
[1:50:17] <%LaughingCatt> Necromancer was literally entirely unique
[1:50:21] <%MugenSandan> @patstaresat do you think they will actually keep Zenos as the main villain for 6.0 or is he gonna get cleaned up in 5.4 and 5.5
[1:50:21] <+LikeARyder> @ManfredA ma man
[1:50:27] <ManfredA> Necromancer would be sick
[1:50:28] <BinaryShuffle> Sprout Warrior, got it
[1:50:34] <%TheGreatSkenardo> But what about Mime
[1:50:34] <+Neoripo> Confused WAR
[1:50:46] <KoyaMusa> i don't think we can get necromancer though, especially not with the chinese version of this game
[1:50:51] <%MillaMoks> Necromancer and Apothecary would be pretty cool for 6.0
[1:50:56] <%BIumen> SUCH DEV-
[1:50:56] <%LaughingCatt> Hellfire Guillotine yeah
[1:50:56] <+azure22900> It would be cool to have side classes, so Ink mage is part of Black mage etc for themed effects
[1:50:57] <SpookyBeef7> I mean, we do technically have Thief already, they just don't get the Ninja upgrade.
[1:51:03] <DianaTheAscian> SAY THAN LAHHABREA
[1:51:06] <%CzeekyPlays> I literally got to about 35 without doing my WAR quests. I felt so dumb running dungeons without my cooldowns
[1:51:08] <$apolitenoob> What about Chocobo Knight? Let's get really weird and fancy, have a mounted knight class
[1:51:08] <DianaTheAscian> THE*
[1:51:11] <%penitentpentwitch> When you're watching a streamer do Praetorium and get into and out of Castrum before them
[1:51:14] <%realm_forge> I love that point in rpgs when you get so strong you can go back and beat the shit out of the world ending nuke monster like it’s nothing
[1:51:15] <XyraFhoan> berserker is just the war-drk fusion that delirium and inner release have been spiralling towards
[1:51:15] <Blackjack760> necromancer can't happen in this game and the lore would be hard to explain
[1:51:17] <zenanon> PATHETIC
[1:51:17] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Could do zombos and ghosts if they kept out all the boners
[1:51:18] <SpookyBeef7> Necromancer could work depending on how you word it.
[1:51:20] <%Shockrates20XX> Chemist sounds too much like Alchemist, so it'll be Apothecary.
[1:51:23] <+zevitunez> ONION KNIGHT
[1:51:29] <+Cuon_Alpinus> Just sling Black Rose onto the boss, EZ Kappa
[1:51:29] <BinaryShuffle> I bet they will call it Apoth
[1:51:29] <heartlesshealer> Chemist would be damn nice
[1:51:32] <%MillaMoks> Chemist IS radical
[1:51:33] <commanderapathy> nocro for dps?
[1:51:35] <%Typhaeon> What a jobber
[1:51:36] <Klefth> Imagine if the casting animations are just shaking vials LUL
[1:51:38] <bapscal> hehe assians
[1:51:38] <@Velyndra> suck assian
[1:51:39] <commanderapathy> necro
[1:51:39] <%Shonen_hero> Lahabitch
[1:51:40] <+A0N33> He sucks ASScian?
[1:51:40] <%lucidrush> Vampire class pls
[1:51:42] <StaticSunrise> lahabrea is bitchmade
[1:51:43] <zenanon> Green Mage
[1:51:44] <Jdrockefeller> chemist, mix dancer like heals, rifle weapon
[1:51:44] <%penitentpentwitch> Job beyond Jobbed
[1:51:44] <+ALazo> Lahabrea was such a gigantic jobber
[1:51:45] <floatRand> Poor Lahabread
[1:51:47] <%Rumbutt> How's it feel, to be a LahaBITCH
[1:51:48] <%Valdorick> The he gets Omnikilled
[1:51:49] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Look at this bishie mofo
[1:51:50] <DianaTheAscian> i thought it was only 3?
[1:51:51] <LilacsandFreedom> Lahabrea died as he lived. like a bitch.
[1:51:53] <KoyaMusa> they still haven't explained how this goober escaped the sundering
[1:51:54] <heartlesshealer> Apothecary - APT?
[1:51:55] <%LaughingCatt> have you guys played WoW? Death Knight is literally all about death & gore & its out in China with just some texture swapping. China would definetly not be an issue for Necromancer
[1:51:55] <rookieknookie> thoughts on Yokai event
[1:51:55] <ManfredA> time for Lahabrea's super relevant spiel
[1:51:56] <%Valdorick> he doesn't get nice killed, he dies like a bitch
[1:51:56] <Explodincatz> why is the text so small?
[1:51:57] <+SH1NK1R0> Zenos is definitely the 6.P villain. They are blatantly setting jim up to eat zodiark
[1:51:57] <+UberWolfman> Elidibus litrally calls him a shitty acxien
[1:51:58] <Jdrockefeller> give me light party that could do a drive by
[1:51:58] <vVAstrAVv> isnt alchemist chemist?
[1:51:59] <DetroitSentai> CHM is more unique than APY or whatever, and apothecary is very close in to alchemist
[1:52:07] <+ALazo> They treat him like a big deal later and I'm like 'huh? that guy?'
[1:52:07] <%Aleate> But isn't that Thancred? Kappa
[1:52:13] <%AncelDeLambert> PAAAAAAAAT I haven't even talked to the vegetables yet!
[1:52:15] <+azure22900> Then you get chad Emet flexing all the time.
[1:52:20] <%penitentpentwitch> If you count Hades EX, 6
[1:52:20] <vVAstrAVv> chm is just alc
[1:52:21] <Jdrockefeller> Pat padding the stats
[1:52:21] <%kenstank> lahabrea is the friend nobody likes but you keep him around because you don't feel like drama
[1:52:25] <%BIumen> @PatStaresAt Who is a bigger loser chump, Lahabrea or Ilberd
[1:52:25] <wakeupsuper12> related to aya brea?
[1:52:26] <%krazy_likeafox> don't forget haades
[1:52:27] <+DontMindMee> Oh I guess that's true
[1:52:27] <ASleepySnek> no hes already dead dead at 4
[1:52:28] <@spacecapncrone> Then Emet-Selch shit talks him after he's dead, which makes six
[1:52:28] <skyheys> "The Golem has never been so hard pressed!"
[1:52:28] <DianaTheAscian> oh u count those
[1:52:30] <%snugglepuggs> actually hes beaten 3 times lol
[1:52:31] <Meta_Outhorii> The idea of yeeting glass vials of healing at players aesthetically pleases me greatly for chemist
[1:52:31] <%SpcOpsBear> Also, the only other class I know that really "dual wields" in FF is Assassin, which overlaps with Ninja
[1:52:31] <%walternatorz> There's an non boss NPC that gets owned harder...
[1:52:32] <%FlakkLIVE> time mage as a healer would be neat
[1:52:32] <DetroitSentai> Reminder he is super fucked up because he body jumps all the time
[1:52:34] <KoyaMusa> and to think, HE escaped the sundering
[1:52:35] <%apostateCourier> lahabrea's soul is GONE
[1:52:37] <%TheGreatSkenardo> This dialogue is unbelievably shitty
[1:52:42] <zenanon> The Chad Emet-Selch and the Virgin Lahabrea
[1:52:45] <floatRand> He was a nerd though
[1:52:45] <jeffishype> THE BOY
[1:52:48] <%BIumen> look at this shb dialogue
[1:52:51] <TioXyco> there's also Lahabrea in UWU no?
[1:52:51] <%thegreatbambe> Don't forget about in UWU
[1:52:58] <%Shonen_hero> baby
[1:53:02] <%maenos2> psaDogchamp
[1:53:03] <ManfredA> yeah
[1:53:03] <%weissguard> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:53:05] <ManfredA> of course he is
[1:53:06] <%TheGreatSkenardo> psaDogchamp
[1:53:08] <%realm_forge> Bla bla darkness, bla bla confluence bla bla
[1:53:08] <lucky_icarus> Pat, what dye is that on the Ala Mhigan coat?
[1:53:09] <%snugglepuggs> estienien doesnt count
[1:53:10] <XyraFhoan> he's there to job
[1:53:10] <@spacecapncrone> can we go for ten?
[1:53:12] <TioXyco> yeah, that's the LahabreaD meme
[1:53:12] <%LegendGHT> is there no Necromancer in Chinese Diablo 3?
[1:53:12] <LilacsandFreedom> all the other Paragons get these beautiful tragedies and then there's Bread
[1:53:12] <floatRand> Ah yeah and he gets smacked there too
[1:53:12] <%LaughingCatt> he's sticky
[1:53:15] <ScarletPrime> Almost like Titan, Garuda, and Shiva.
[1:53:17] <Shonen_hero> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:53:18] <DetroitSentai> UWU isnt canot
[1:53:19] <DianaTheAscian> UWU?
[1:53:19] <%mike2hands> psaDogchamp
[1:53:20] <%Mr_Pylon> so bad villain, or fun villain?
[1:53:22] <+zevitunez> is that thancred?
[1:53:22] <+crovvv> That sounds like some Square Enix shit
[1:53:29] <ManfredA> Nabriales nearly fucked you up though
[1:53:29] <neVan0> LUL
[1:53:29] <+Neoripo> True xD
[1:53:30] <floatRand> Nabriales was sundered tho
[1:53:31] <commanderapathy> so hard
[1:53:31] <Futurecity10> I for get what uwu is
[1:53:32] <%Ciglossonjr> No pat Laha is in Zenos because Zenos absorbed the primal that was made using the aether from the eyes
[1:53:34] <ManfredA> like he nearly won
[1:53:34] <floatRand> Who are basically bitch-ascians
[1:53:36] <cascadepersona> FFXIV throws a massive curve ball, and just introduces the Gadabout vocation from Dragon Quest.
[1:53:37] <%Raiden_Breaker> lad had no chill
[1:53:37] <%BIumen> yeah he was a fucking jobber
[1:53:37] <%Shonen_hero> bork bork
[1:53:41] <%ryome> The greatest jobber
[1:53:41] <+azure22900> oh right lol
[1:53:42] <Vengie14> Zodiark ain't sending his best
[1:53:43] <DetroitSentai> Laha is fun as shit, crazy body jumper man
[1:53:43] <KoyaMusa> man you know what sucks in the jp version of the game, nabriales crys how he doesn't want to die
[1:53:46] <commanderapathy> what about Igyorhim
[1:53:50] <%maenos2> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[1:53:51] <+alphonseisbest> Yea he's no CHAD EMET
[1:53:55] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Hey Pat, who’s your favorite beast tribe?
[1:53:57] <%realm_forge> LORD ZAMGEIF DEMANDS ATTENTION
[1:54:03] <%Ciglossonjr> Igyorhim got her lines cut
[1:54:03] <%VioletHeart> Nobody gets punked harder than the Ascians in the Summoner questline.
[1:54:04] <skyheys> They cut her part of the story
[1:54:05] <2DSuperiority> Nahbralas at least tricks new players into wasting LB3 on him and not the Tear
[1:54:05] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> excited for the new ascian
[1:54:08] <+Neoripo> TRUE
[1:54:09] <skyheys> it sucks
[1:54:10] <KoyaMusa> oh igeyorhm's character was scrapped according to the writers, she's supposed to be a parallel to ysayle
[1:54:16] <Klefth> And she was unsundered too, wasn't she? LUL
[1:54:17] <%penitentpentwitch> Looking forward to the next Ascian
[1:54:18] <+azure22900> The gets knight of the round by a single knight
[1:54:20] <%CzeekyPlays> Is it worth paying attention to the post-2.0 ARR MSQ content until Heavensward? @PatStaresAt
[1:54:21] <%BIumen> I still think Ilberd is a massive loser
[1:54:21] <%valriot> And yet i still feel bad for them LUL
[1:54:23] <ManfredA> no
[1:54:26] <ManfredA> Ige was sundered
[1:54:29] <+HitoBeat> Emet-Selch was cool though
[1:54:29] <bapscal> everything that igeyorhm ever did happened offscreen which is a shame because shes one of the most interesting ones to me :/
[1:54:29] <TioXyco> nah, she was sundered
[1:54:32] <%valriot> DAMN DANIEL
[1:54:33] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> fandango
[1:54:34] <%LaughingCatt> Fancy Daniel?
[1:54:37] <zenanon> Fandanman
[1:54:37] <%penitentpentwitch> 2.55 is important
[1:54:39] <floatRand> Fandaniel seems real Kefka-like
[1:54:43] <Finaldragoon> @Klefth no, only Lahabrea, Emet, and Elidibus were unsundered
[1:54:43] <DianaTheAscian> she just shows up and dies LUL
[1:54:44] <%Atomik456> @PatStaresAt the really sad thing is with the revelation about Elidibus having forgotten everything, Lahabrea was the only person Emet could talk to about the old days. Imagine, Lahabrea being your only connection to your past.
[1:54:49] <%Aeogard> absolutely worth paying attention
[1:54:49] <BinaryShuffle> I thought there was only 1 Ascian left, been a while since I played
[1:54:50] <DetroitSentai> 2.x is super important story wise
[1:54:51] <heartlesshealer> it's world building
[1:54:52] <ManfredA> Fandaniel and Pashtarot will likely be important in 6.0
[1:54:55] <+Neoripo> Story YES, gameplay NO
[1:54:57] <Futurecity10> It’s really not
[1:54:58] <commanderapathy> I hated elidibus until this patch
[1:54:58] <%BIumen> iceheart
[1:55:00] <+alphonseisbest> YES but it SUSKS
[1:55:01] <+crovvv> I literally only started paying proper attention in Heavensward
[1:55:06] <DetroitSentai> It sets up most of the 4.0 conflict
[1:55:08] <skyheys> They cut a shitloaf of it
[1:55:09] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> sloppy
[1:55:09] <%Aeogard> so much of the world building sets up so many things that pay off later
[1:55:10] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt also shiva
[1:55:15] <zenanon> Crystal Bros
[1:55:20] <+Cuon_Alpinus> LUL
[1:55:20] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> oh you
[1:55:21] <+metal_gearxxx> Kappa
[1:55:21] <+ImmaterialHero> SLOPPEH
[1:55:22] <commanderapathy> the crystal bitches
[1:55:23] <Klefth> Sloppeh, even
[1:55:23] <+ALazo> You mean the weapon one?
[1:55:23] <%penitentpentwitch> The Griffin is the most successful of all villain in FF14
[1:55:23] <%walternatorz> SLOPPEH
[1:55:23] <aeonicvector> Sloppeh
[1:55:23] <lucky_icarus> SLOPPEH!
[1:55:23] <TioXyco> eeeeeey
[1:55:24] <DetroitSentai> shiva is also there
[1:55:24] <cyclone722> ay
[1:55:26] <ManfredA> @BinaryShuffle Pashtarot and Halmarut are still MIA, Fandaniel is relevant now
[1:55:26] <%the22cstomp> SLOPPEH
[1:55:26] <%krazy_likeafox> sloppeh
[1:55:27] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> SLOPPEH
[1:55:27] <shinji_ifrit> HAH FUNNY MAN IS FUNNY
[1:55:28] <kitcorin> SLOPPEH
[1:55:29] <+ALazo> I ignored that super hard
[1:55:30] <+Neoripo> SLOPEEH
[1:55:31] <%Shonen_hero> I'm starting to really enjoy the Crystal Braves after that feast
[1:55:31] <%Aeogard> SLOPPAYY
[1:55:31] <+Arkfyre> sloppeh
[1:55:32] <%CzeekyPlays> It is pretty damn boring and long but if it sets up stuff, that's fine
[1:55:34] <%Shonen_hero> you know the one
[1:55:35] <%BIumen> it even sets up stormblood
[1:55:36] <aeonicvector> FERALIMIGHO
[1:55:39] <+UberWolfman> SLOPPEH
[1:55:42] <Futurecity10> WHEELY DEELY ARM NO FEELY
[1:55:46] <floatRand> Apparently the voice line is played in the solo duty in 5.3 msq
[1:55:48] <%debugdrawray_> crystal braves is like the whole reason things roll into stormblood
[1:55:49] <floatRand> I personally missed it
[1:55:49] <XyraFhoan> yeah, I've heard they've seriously cleaned up the quests so if you're new, the pacing is way smoother
[1:55:50] <@spacecapncrone> There's a bit of the post 2.0 story that's just cleanup on some content from 1.x and it's a bit aimless
[1:55:52] <%SpcOpsBear> @PatStaresAt Biggest LEL is if they end up making the new DPS a class that uses fucking Measures as their weapon.
[1:55:52] <%LegendGHT> that dog never stops pissing and shitting does he
[1:55:53] <cascadepersona> Should I run through every optional dungeon as I get them in 2.X (Hard dungeons, etc.).
[1:56:01] <SpookyBeef7> Man, I actually forgot all about Igeyorhm.
[1:56:02] <+Tahstachio> just one giant fist
[1:56:12] <Klefth> Fun fact: if you just let him rock in tat one 5.3 instance, he does go "Sloppeh~!"
[1:56:12] <%penitentpentwitch> Sassy Pat
[1:56:13] <%Neryl_> Pat. =(
[1:56:19] <Futurecity10> @cascadepersona they are good exp yes
[1:56:22] <%Typhaeon> She made him come up there monkaS
[1:56:22] <%the38bandit> psaFist psaFist
[1:56:24] <farrellcityking> Yeaaaah, more dog piss and shit talk
[1:56:25] <ManfredA> I can't forget Ige because her and Lahabrea fucked over Hades EX parties the most on day 1
[1:56:28] <%SpcOpsBear> No, wait, now I got it - how to solve "beastmaster" as a real job. Make it Animist.
[1:56:30] <%SirGO0SE> or the location Kreygasm

[1:59:06] <DianaTheAscian> no
[1:59:11] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> is it a war? I thought it's just fandanial
[1:59:12] <%AncelDeLambert> poggers is this PogChamp
[1:59:14] <+alphonseisbest> Is this the og theme or remix?
[1:59:29] <%AncelDeLambert> and it turns out the guy whose face this is is like an antivaxxer or something
[1:59:42] <%FlakkLIVE> Doesnt seem like there are enough Ascians left for there to be a civil war
[1:59:49] <Sydin18> I do love Chili
[1:59:50] <%SomeSageAdvice> original @alphonseisbest
[1:59:52] <commanderapathy> also yotsuyu did nothing wrong
[1:59:54] <vVAstrAVv> its the tempest version
[1:59:58] <%Ciglossonjr> I figure that there must be some ascians that are still totally loyal to the unsundered's ideal, and they would probably have a problem with ones like Daniel
[1:59:58] <+Neoripo> I am so upset with shitty Ascian
[2:00:05] <TioXyco> at the same time?!
[2:00:06] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Hey man, I forgot but why is it that so many people say Alphinaud is responsible for a shit ton of things in HW?
[2:00:06] <kumasbear> mine too
[2:00:09] <DianaTheAscian> he pees while eating?
[2:00:21] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> god I wish his name was just daniel
[2:00:22] <%Nobrev> pat theres a line
[2:00:28] <%afronooch> alphinaud sucks
[2:00:31] <%terminallyCapriciousz> we ignore big streamer man
[2:00:31] <%valriot> Hey man, he tried
[2:00:33] <%realm_forge> Just like his dad
[2:00:34] <%CzeekyPlays> Alphinaud kinda sucks
[2:00:38] <%kenstank> he's just a baby!!
[2:00:38] <DianaTheAscian> but he had good intentions
[2:00:39] <ManfredA> Fandaniel is the name of a scion of light, it's not just a random name
[2:00:40] <%lucidrush> Im so poor. I feel like i should have more gil
[2:00:41] <azacca_bitter> Man, alphinaud is so unsympathetic
[2:00:41] <KoyaMusa> just throw the wol at any problem
[2:00:43] <skyheys> bitch ass little elf
[2:00:45] <+azure22900> He's so bad they had to make up a twin
[2:00:46] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> alphy is baby
[2:00:49] <DetroitSentai> He's great, his development in HW and StB is great
[2:00:50] <%Ciglossonjr> Fandaniel's name in french literally translates to "damn daniel"
[2:00:54] <XyraFhoan> Alphinaud in ARR is a wee baby trying to wear adult pants

[2:02:18] <ManfredA> @kumasbear they're harder than the others which means good players avoid them because of baddies and baddies avoid them because of wiping

[2:02:43] <%realm_forge> Doing math makes the pat orb purr
[2:02:45] <%SpcOpsBear> HASH BROWNS AND MTG COMMANDER
[2:02:45] <%DensityD> HUAKKE MANOR
[2:02:48] <ManfredA> YOU GET RABANASTRE
[2:02:48] <%SpcOpsBear> My favorite memes!
[2:02:49] <DetroitSentai> It's super easy math
[2:02:52] <kozboz96> hes a mount now mothma3Moffchamp
[2:02:52] <%FlakkLIVE> Just did the Ivalice raids for the first time a few weeks ago, they're pretty fuckin rad
[2:02:54] <+LittleBigQuebec> 1 2 3 4 and yes
[2:02:57] <ASleepySnek> 1234
[2:02:58] <%FlakkLIVE> But no one seems to ever want to do them
[2:03:04] <HCWindo> Did Pat already do the MSQ?
[2:03:05] <DetroitSentai> No
[2:03:07] <%LegendGHT> quick maths
[2:03:09] <%realm_forge> I’m already confused
[2:03:10] <ManfredA> here's the best tip for Construct 7
[2:03:12] <Lt_Campbell> Math boss!
[2:03:15] <ManfredA> 1 is not counted as a prime number
[2:03:17] <floatRand> No, it is that boss sets your HP to 1-3, and the circle gives you 1-4 extra hp.
[2:03:18] <wakeupsuper12> GEOMANCER
[2:03:18] <kozboz96> pat you gonna ride him as a mount and bring math to the masses
[2:03:19] <Daxalog> Quick mafs
[2:03:19] <ScarletPrime> Its 1-2-3-4 and you get your Max HP lowered to a single digit and have to do math with your HP.
[2:03:20] <neVan0> oh god no
[2:03:21] <Lt_Campbell> Dancing Robot doing the space dance
[2:03:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> YEAH WALKING IN PLACE
[2:03:29] <lucky_icarus> I fail EVERYTIME....
[2:03:30] <floatRand> And boss says 'divisible by X' or 'yeah go do primes'
[2:03:31] <KoyaMusa> tell me what a prime number is mother fucker
[2:03:36] <+ALazo> You gotta make your health that number by standing on something that adds or subtracts to your health
[2:03:38] <ScarletPrime> The big thing tho.
[2:03:38] <@spacecapncrone> I'd have been more interested in math in school if I got damage buffs for having right answers.
[2:03:39] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[2:03:39] <%BIumen> yeah but i didnt know to look at my health lol instructions were weird
[2:03:41] <+WinstonThrasher> yeah if there was a better indicator of what number youre working with, it wouldnt be so bad
[2:03:41] <%the22cstomp> tanks are already fighting aggro lmao
[2:03:41] <Reireizei> You're technically fighting Lahabrea again
[2:03:46] <nsDrummer> LUL
[2:03:47] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PatStaresAt also , remember that 1 is not a prime number Kappa
[2:03:51] <%Typhaeon> Hey, watch it buddy
[2:03:53] <Reireizei> Mateus has his symbol on his staff
[2:03:54] <ManfredA> prime number is a number only divisible by itself and 1
[2:03:54] <Daxalog> Who?
[2:03:54] <ScarletPrime> REMEMBER: 1 is not a Prime Number. Because 1 isn't a Number in Greek understanding of math.
[2:03:55] <floatRand> If you fail you get vulnerability that instantly kills you via next AoE
[2:03:57] <ScarletPrime> Thanks Square.
[2:03:57] <+ZipperHands> I live there and it really is
[2:04:00] <Lt_Campbell> i like he Ivilician Espers tho jermaPluto
[2:04:02] <aeonicvector> Mateus is a WAY cooler primal tho
[2:04:06] <ManfredA> so 1, 5, 7, 9
[2:04:07] <DetroitSentai> The boss makes your health a single digit and then asks it to be divisible by 2, 3, or prime. and you step on the numbered circles to add to your health to do that
[2:04:09] <filialpails> 1 isn't prime because if it was the fundamental theorem of arithmetic wouldn't work
[2:04:10] <+ALazo> Half the times I mess it up is because I don't get the operation the thing in the floor is doing to my health
[2:04:11] <%SpcOpsBear> psaCrazy psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead Pat has got it wrong
[2:04:13] <+ALazo> Until too late
[2:04:13] <+Neoripo> I always drown in this fight
[2:04:16] <ManfredA> except 1 doesn't count
[2:04:17] <Coliaki> doesn't the boss say indivisible? pretty sure you can have 1
[2:04:21] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Are the Asicans all based off of the Espers from 12/Ivalice?
[2:04:22] <%the22cstomp> fists of fire pat
[2:04:24] <Lt_Campbell> you kick, you punch its all in the mind
[2:04:28] <+UberWolfman> Port War of the Liuons SE!!!
[2:04:33] <ManfredA> @AmanisHouseOfNonsense yes
[2:04:37] <XyraFhoan> also if people didn't run by without reading all the scattered readable objects in Ridorana, they actually give you help on the math too, one of the robots lists all the prime numbers that could possibly be in the fight
[2:04:42] <Daxalog> Are you damaging or tanking?
[2:04:48] <ManfredA> They're all named after the scions of light and use their crests as masks
[2:04:48] <aeonicvector> @AmanisHouseOfNonsense Kinda, they have a derived namesake from 12
[2:04:52] <%penitentpentwitch> "Do mechanics"
[2:04:53] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> WotL for switch pls
[2:04:56] <filialpails> every number needs to have a unique set of prime factors, but if 1 was allowed as a prime that wouldn't be true
[2:05:02] <%DensityD> but my rotation .........
[2:05:06] <Sydin18> Just hope to use Earth's Reply and turn off ur head for abit
[2:05:09] <Lt_Campbell> Situational awareness is important kids
[2:05:13] <DetroitSentai> You can stop those from spawning if you do the mechanic
[2:05:13] <%the22cstomp> monk is pretty easy, you just alternate dragon kick and bootshine, and every other rotation you use twin snake and demolish
[2:05:15] <%shadowace2400> are you doing MSQ anytime?
[2:05:18] <Ell1ot> i like not dying
[2:05:20] <+crazyspartan214> My teachers told me 1 is a prime number GOD DAMMIT MATH TEACHERS!!!!!!
[2:05:21] <nsDrummer> respecting mechanics PogChamp
[2:05:23] <%Stipli> sorry just noticed the notification @king_wragles thx for the gift sub if you are still here
[2:05:24] <azacca_bitter> No, stay the fuck out of my leyline
[2:05:26] <Daxalog> But what if I WANT to die?
[2:05:43] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PatStaresAt Did you know Mateus is the Esper ascociated with Lahabrea in XII/Tactics lore?
[2:05:43] <+alphonseisbest> whats the highest ILevel at current? @pat
[2:05:53] <BinaryShuffle> Situational awareness, Pat? You don't pay my sub j/k j/k
[2:05:58] <%the22cstomp> 500 @alphonseisbest
[2:05:59] <nsDrummer> 500 basically
[2:06:00] <Blackjack760> 505?
[2:06:00] <+LaughingCatt> I havent seen Mataeus' limit break in literal years
[2:06:02] <ManfredA> yeah Rabanastre gets dicked on these days
[2:06:03] <floatRand> Yeah it is just possible shitstomp him and kill him before throttles kill you
[2:06:05] <ASleepySnek> 500
[2:06:05] <%MrBorisMakarov> 500 @alphonseisbest I believe
[2:06:05] <KenzBurp> I'm trying to learn RDM and I'm uh....not great at it. Give me my cane back
[2:06:10] <ManfredA> except Hashmal can still wipe raids
[2:06:10] <%Typhaeon> Mechanics?
[2:06:10] <DetroitSentai> Ilvl crunch funny
[2:06:10] <%the22cstomp> 505 is only the weapon
[2:06:11] <nsDrummer> 505 is just the weapon
[2:06:13] <+alphonseisbest> cool
[2:06:13] <%Typhaeon> What mechanics
[2:06:14] <%penitentpentwitch> It's been nerfed pretty hard
[2:06:21] <%LaughingCatt> not so lucky with Hasbrowns tho
[2:06:24] <Blackjack760> oh ye the weapon
[2:06:35] <StaticSunrise> but the SEALS!
[2:06:36] <ManfredA> yep you don't even do frogs anymore
[2:06:41] <KoyaMusa> sell
[2:07:06] <nsDrummer> LUL
[2:07:07] <DetroitSentai> @PatStaresAt Dont forget before 4.x was over the Deltascape 2 boss no longer did the big flip because damage was so high
[2:07:08] <%the22cstomp> that was ridorana
[2:07:08] <nsDrummer> i remember that

[2:07:30] <ManfredA> it was great
[2:07:32] <%LaughingCatt> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead that was for Lighthouse not Rabanastre

[2:10:44] <%the22cstomp> 6.0 is gonna be a banger though
[2:10:48] <nsDrummer> not gonna play it? or not gonna stream it?
[2:11:05] <Amplificate> tbh do it with your buddies so you enjoy it more c:
[2:11:07] <+alphonseisbest> it w;as sooo Fun to watch tho
[2:11:10] <nsDrummer> no life it Kappa
[2:11:12] <Ashecroft> yeah, enjoy it with friends Pat
[2:11:19] <+alphonseisbest> i LOVED those streams
[2:11:21] <bashful_bard> Accurate, I played it by myself
[2:11:24] <floatRand> Ah remember SB stream?
[2:11:24] <%CzeekyPlays> Nah no life it then hammer Woolie with it on the podcast Kappa
[2:11:31] <%terminallyCapriciousz> do it in a 24 hour stream kappa
[2:11:32] <%LaughingCatt> only stream the finale once you hit 90 Kappa
[2:11:33] <+rovalbar> it takes five days to bangi t ouy you say?
[2:11:34] <%ChaosAethr> @PatStaresAt In Your Opinion, What do you think about Shadowbringers from 5.0 - 5.3
[2:11:34] <TREEMAN9999> why not stream with pals?
[2:11:40] <Blackjack760> yeah I played it myself first
[2:11:42] <%nobodybutalex> nobodybutalex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! How are you enjoying Monk?
[2:11:42] <%SpcOpsBear> @PatStaresAt How about you no-life it, and then New Game+ it with subscribers?
[2:11:43] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt when's it safe to go back into an enemy attack zone? After the zone disappears, or after the attack animation starts/finishes?
[2:11:44] <Surprise_Anole> I watched the first four streams, then decided it was pretty sick and I should go play ff14 for myself
[2:11:45] <yodajr99> stream it with friends screw chat Kappa
[2:11:46] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> would you consider a spoilercast of 5.3?
[2:11:49] <%weissguard> It was pretty cool to see those streams. Genuinely fun.
[2:11:49] <%the22cstomp> yeah after i finished i went back and watched a lot of the vods
[2:11:51] <+SH1NK1R0> Why not record the buddy run and upload those
[2:11:51] <ManfredA> oh shit we're actually gonna see Hashmal's adds
[2:11:52] <Lt_Campbell> i watched your story vods for your reaction
[2:11:53] <nsDrummer> agreed
[2:11:54] <+pandamancer224> your 5.0 streams got me into 14
[2:12:00] <%Shonen_hero> Do you think it's peaked?
[2:12:04] <Lt_Campbell> yup
[2:12:05] <bashful_bard> Agreed
[2:12:05] <StaticSunrise> there's not a high bar for mmo wuality
[2:12:06] <DarkCloud79> I remember I started like 4 hours before Pat did and just kept playing so I could stay ahead on the story and watch the stream
[2:12:08] <sheepysenka> @patstaresat I've watched that VOD like 5 times
[2:12:09] <StaticSunrise> quality
[2:12:10] <SpookyBeef7> Shadowbringers is easily the best Final Fantasy game I've played in actual years.
[2:12:11] <+unlocked2886> But does he have all the yo-kai weapons
[2:12:13] <CandideCamera> is it ridiculous tho
[2:12:14] <%BIumen> such as
[2:12:16] <Coliaki> in terms of story you mean?
[2:12:17] <LilacsandFreedom> that's mad high praise
[2:12:19] <%marsantas> I'd say this IS the best final fantasy
[2:12:22] <DetroitSentai> My static and I are fans and we always go out of our way to watch your vods for story reactions
[2:12:22] <%CzeekyPlays> What a glow up for this game
[2:12:23] <%Valdorick> Get FUCKED! FF8
[2:12:23] <+pandamancer224> i hope you end up streaming 6.0, but i understand if you dont
[2:12:25] <floatRand> It's in my top 5 Final Fantasies.
[2:12:26] <Amplificate> 6.0 has a massive height to overcome it's probably mindbreakingly stressful
[2:12:29] <+UberWolfman> Top 5 FF game for sure for me
[2:12:31] <aeonicvector> I'd argue theres way more below it then above, theres like.... 9, maybe 7, maybe 6, and personally 4
[2:12:32] <floatRand> Or top 3
[2:12:32] <%snugglepuggs> i watched all your ffxiv stream vods after i surpassed it myself
[2:12:33] <floatRand> even
[2:12:33] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Yeah, everything that people might not have gotten out of FF15 or 13, you'll probably get in this game
[2:12:36] <ExistentialSteak> hopefully 6.0 will make healers fun again, shadowbringers ruined healing
[2:12:37] <nsDrummer> oh boy, golems monkaS
[2:12:40] <+crazyspartan214> thats what they say about GTA Vice City, then cam GTA Sand Andreas!!
[2:12:40] <%SirGO0SE> its a shame the story is such garbage for my first 30 hours of gameplay LUL
[2:12:43] <%LaughingCatt> its my #2 fav FF after FFT
[2:12:46] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> I trust the lead writer lady
[2:12:46] <%cowardman93> honestly 3.0 to 3.3 was above most FF games for me and I'm excited to get to 5.0
[2:12:49] <Daxalog> The pinnacle of the mmo genre. But you still have to do ""Rotations""
[2:12:51] <ManfredA> people forget many of the bad parts of the older FFs
[2:12:54] <+azure22900> 6.0 is prolly gonna feature zeno's a lot
[2:12:58] <KoyaMusa> now we have KILL again
[2:13:04] <Lt_Campbell> damn daniel back at again witht hat cartoonishly eveil acian crap
[2:13:12] <+Neoripo> Current villains are BS
[2:13:14] <%kenstank> yeah I love Zenos but everyone despises him lol
[2:13:18] <heartlesshealer> fight these seeq
[2:13:19] <DetroitSentai> Zeno is great though, and fan daniel is back at it again
[2:13:21] <floatRand> Yeah
[2:13:21] <+Neoripo> AGREED
[2:13:22] <Tomschiii> yep, he seem slike a just evil dudes
[2:13:23] <Lt_Campbell> i hate zenos
[2:13:23] <Surprise_Anole> Zenos needs to go and stay gone
[2:13:25] <+ImmaterialHero> To be fair, Elidibus wasn't particularly interesting before all this
[2:13:26] <Lt_Campbell> hes terrible
[2:13:26] <+alphonseisbest> 6.0 is gonna be ZENO but hopefully gooder
[2:13:26] <DetroitSentai> Zenos is the best tho?
[2:13:27] <LilacsandFreedom> maybe Ishikawa can save it
[2:13:27] <+zepelinnn1> muh hunt ResidentSleeper
[2:13:27] <vVAstrAVv> i never thought xenos was all that great but theyre gonna use him TWICE
[2:13:28] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> 5.3 villain wasn't that great before tho
[2:13:29] <fug74> muh hunt
[2:13:29] <floatRand> Zenos is boring, but Fandaniel might be fun goofy fellow
[2:13:29] <ManfredA> Zenos could be cool if he has a good manager
[2:13:30] <%the22cstomp> but we thought that about [redacted] until 5.3 though
[2:13:31] <%marsantas> I trust that they'll write them better now the good writer is in charge
[2:13:32] <ManfredA> Fandaniel maybe
[2:13:33] <DianaTheAscian> wearing hats must be nice - a Viera
[2:13:35] <%penitentpentwitch> Time for tragic backstory of Zenos and his mother
[2:13:36] <VidulaSaix> They turned Elidibus from nothing into something so they can do it with Zenos
[2:13:36] <%shadowace2400> but I like Zenos...
[2:13:36] <Lt_Campbell> LUL YES
[2:13:37] <floatRand> But we have to have better look at him
[2:13:38] <Tomschiii> zenos is garbage
[2:13:40] <nsDrummer> just let ishikawa steer the story to make zenos better ;)
[2:13:41] <%Rumbutt> I feel like if Ishikawa writes Zenos she could salvage him
[2:13:42] <%Raiden_Breaker> Zenos looks better with his armor gone
[2:13:42] <%Valdorick> Discount Arthas
[2:13:42] <SpookyBeef7> To be fair, current Zenos at least has more of a personality than SB Zenos.
[2:13:43] <Lt_Campbell> BARGAIN BIN SEPHIROTH LUL
[2:13:45] <+TheDestinyPotato> zenos is not the kind of character that should be a main antagonist
[2:13:46] <%dekkitout> So the "MCU Villain Problem"?
[2:13:47] <DianaTheAscian> he has a sword
[2:13:47] <floatRand> You certainly can expand him
[2:13:49] <%Valdorick> He's not even Sephisephi
[2:13:49] <+azure22900> Plus an Ascien unbound!
[2:13:51] <%DensityD> one winged puppy
[2:13:52] <DetroitSentai> Zenos is way better than sepphy imo
[2:13:54] <ManfredA> Zenos is not even remotely close to Sephiroth
[2:13:58] <Surprise_Anole> I'll never forgive Zenos for all those long boring instances where I had to fight him for ten minutes before a scripted loss
[2:13:58] <floatRand> I mean what was our opinion of ascians before 5.0?
[2:13:58] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Just bring out more Yoko Taro!
[2:13:58] <+pandamancer224> which patch did Emmet first appear?
[2:14:00] <%DensityD> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:14:03] <LilacsandFreedom> Zenos is just Jiren
[2:14:07] <DianaTheAscian> was die
[2:14:07] <%kenstank> his supplementary material really fleshes him out but its a shame its in like a short story on Square's website lol
[2:14:08] <%KishinGrek> KishinGrek subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! hey Pat, if you could make one game logic aspect real which would you choose? personally I'd take easy money making or full health food items.PS did you see that monkey king , Wukong Trailer?
[2:14:09] <%Raiden_Breaker> he has to kill someone you like gotcha
[2:14:10] <ManfredA> 4.4 @pandamancer224
[2:14:13] <floatRand> Lol edgedark go zodiark boo light!
[2:14:14] <KoyaMusa> the coolest thing he did was kill himself?
[2:14:20] <+BloodyBurney> a lot of people really don't like Zenos huh?
[2:14:21] <yodajr99> nah all the villains aren't dead alphonso lives
[2:14:27] <DarkCloud79> I honestly believe Zenos is more like discounts kefka
[2:14:29] <%wjones0415> yeah, zenos is a massive disappointment.
[2:14:31] <+pandamancer224> thank you
[2:14:32] <Lt_Campbell> yeah the coolest thing he did was actually kill himself
[2:14:34] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> zenos thicc tho
[2:14:35] <%Valdorick> Maybe you'll Echo him and get to play it in 6.0?
[2:14:36] <+azure22900> I think the dude with Zeno's is going to be the one to carry shit, Zenos is just gonna be used as a tool.
[2:14:39] <+crazyspartan214> what if discount Sephfirot become final form Sephfirot?
[2:14:41] <Tomschiii> because there is nothing to like in zenos. ofc people dont like him
[2:14:43] <Azathotic> Zenos is a creepy manchild fightbeast. You can do things with his world crumbling down around him because thats a dumb way to be
[2:14:44] <DetroitSentai> Zenos is good though
[2:14:45] <aeonicvector> The villians arent all dead til we get Lolorito dont @ me
[2:14:45] <lycandruid> are you in a tunnel ?
[2:14:45] <%LaughingCatt> Zenos is a lot more like Kefka than Sepphy
[2:14:48] <nsDrummer> LUL
[2:14:48] <Lt_Campbell> LUL YES
[2:14:50] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Sabi Hakuhei was also the best off screen villain.
[2:14:50] <%the22cstomp> PLEASE
[2:14:51] <%weissguard> LUL
[2:14:55] <heartlesshealer> Thanks for the HyperCrate @kishingrek
[2:14:57] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> shirtless fight with zenos
[2:14:58] <+zepelinnn1> Zenos is boring
[2:14:58] <%cvp5127> damn
[2:14:59] <%dekkitout> tajC
[2:14:59] <neVan0> LUL
[2:15:01] <DianaTheAscian> i like the edge jacket
[2:15:01] <%weissguard> Or Bad Man on his pink shirt.
[2:15:01] <%nmaten> zenos has the cake
[2:15:01] <+Neoripo> Do It
[2:15:02] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> What is with you and Juicy Pat? WutFace
[2:15:05] <%Aeogard> zenos coat is cool
[2:15:07] <KenzBurp> there's a mod for that
[2:15:12] <Surprise_Anole> The clap of his buttcheeks keeps alerting the warrior of light
[2:15:12] <KoyaMusa> i have to assume we go garlemald next expansion but with how much garlean stuff we're doing now i have small doubts
[2:15:13] <ManfredA> Zenos is a sociopathic serial murder
[2:15:14] <%Ciglossonjr> MY FRIEND, I HAVE BECOME STRONGER, AND JUICIER
[2:15:16] <ManfredA> he can be interesting
[2:15:18] <%Raiden_Breaker> what if they gave him a jar of mustard
[2:15:19] <SpookyBeef7> Oh, I know the mod.
[2:15:23] <Lt_Campbell> LUL jermaThing
[2:15:24] <%Aeogard> i like zenos a lot more than most people but i do hope he gets more actual characterization
[2:15:28] <heartlesshealer> nice
[2:15:29] <bashful_bard> We didn't necessarily meet 5.0s villain until 5.55
[2:15:30] <nsDrummer> perfect LUL
[2:15:36] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Oh god, I need to see this
[2:15:38] <%kenstank> he's the yandere husbando
[2:15:43] <+rovalbar> well now we have to see it
[2:15:49] <Sydin18> Now we got NSFW Cid mod
[2:15:51] <bashful_bard> 4.55 even
[2:15:53] <%MisterTylerrr> Hey I'm back
[2:15:55] <aeonicvector> 6.0 til 5.55
[2:15:58] <DetroitSentai> Zenos was also written by the DRK.ShB writer @PatStaresAt
[2:16:02] <+ImmaterialHero> also Damn Daniel is funny
[2:16:05] <Sydin18> To spice up MSQ rouls
[2:16:07] <SpookyBeef7> Oh gods, I've seen that Cid mod.
[2:16:07] <StaticSunrise> I hope we go back to ala mhigo just to see lyse die
[2:16:11] <SlimeSlimeSlime> FF 1.4 You Are [NOT] Juicy
[2:16:12] <%Ciglossonjr> I actually hope he doesn't get much characterization and stays a weird psycho
[2:16:19] <Lt_Campbell> really
[2:16:20] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> what's up with the clone tanks
[2:16:20] <Lt_Campbell> is he now
[2:16:21] <nsDrummer> ishikawa Kreygasm
[2:16:21] <+ALazo> Not their best work
[2:16:22] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> lmao, Juicy's just in a big ass Sans font LUL
[2:16:26] <DetroitSentai> What Emet fucking great right away
[2:16:33] <ManfredA> don't make Zenos a sympathetic villain
[2:16:36] <DetroitSentai> Also Zenos is good
[2:16:37] <%afronooch> cheer500 shadowbringers is great, but Triumph is still my favorite boss theme
[2:16:38] <KoyaMusa> well we already have a good deal what the new ascian, i saw the alchemical comparisons and at least i'm interested in that
[2:16:39] <+zepelinnn1> well maybe she can oull something out of his ass
[2:16:39] <%afronooch> afronooch's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[2:16:41] <+Neoripo> Can she pull off another miracle
[2:16:43] <ManfredA> let him stay a stupid manchild murder hobo
[2:16:46] <%weissguard> This area looks a little plain, but kinda cool.
[2:16:48] <+skeletonmilk> @PatStaresAt Do you have a favorite minion?
[2:16:49] <%Aeogard> What if Zenos turns into like the villain that helps us fight a bigger villain
[2:16:52] <+azure22900> You cant
[2:16:59] <$Trenr> no he needs to be just fucking straight up evil
[2:17:01] <%kenstank> I can't remember where I read it but someone said he's a Force of Nature villain in a cast of Plotter villains and that made sense
[2:17:05] <@spacecapncrone> I dunno if you can make him sympathetic since he *loves* being a murder hobo. he LOVES it
[2:17:06] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Zenos going full Kefka is the best path I think
[2:17:07] <+BloodyBurney> Zenos needs to be a monster who's cool
[2:17:08] <%shadowace2400> true
[2:17:10] <VidulaSaix> They need to make him Culprit
[2:17:11] <+LittleBigQuebec> make him a dark reflection of us but in all the wrong ways
[2:17:14] <%LaughingCatt> so basically you want them to go balls to the wall nuts with him
[2:17:15] <floatRand> 1. Make him less sympathetic. 2. Lean HARDER on the whole 'you are my only friend' angle.
[2:17:18] <%marsantas> Well right now he seems to want to EAT zodiark so there is that
[2:17:19] <BluBox> I think it's impossible to write him as a sympathetic villain by now
[2:17:19] <%LaughingCatt> i can dig that
[2:17:20] <ManfredA> Zenos's backstory is that he was too good at everything and the only time he ever got his dick hard was when he got his shit kicked as a kid
[2:17:22] <+ALazo> He's already 'I did it for my battle boner for you'
[2:17:22] <%penitentpentwitch> Give him the Vauthry treatment! More ham!
[2:17:23] <nsDrummer> yeah just full on pure evil works good for zenos
[2:17:24] <Sydin18> Let him dig deeper into being more bloodthirsty and horny
[2:17:27] <%ChaosAethr> Zeno is psychopath
[2:17:28] <DetroitSentai> He didnt do it for the lols, he did it for power, he's a virgil
[2:17:28] <Surprise_Anole> it's weird they just randomly killed off the scientist who made him into a superman as a middle dungeon boss
[2:17:28] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> zenos, pray return to garlemald
[2:17:30] <DarkCloud79> The thing is, we already beat Zenos as the final boss in stormblood. he lost, you don't get a do-over
[2:17:31] <%kenstank> let me kiss him a lil bit
[2:17:34] <lucky_icarus> After Emet and Elidibus, I NEED Zenos to just be a monster.
[2:17:38] <Lt_Campbell> monkaS
[2:17:39] <floatRand> YES
[2:17:40] <SpookyBeef7> Like, even more evil than Vauthry was at least, and he was extremely fucking evil to begin with.
[2:17:41] <%Ciglossonjr> I want the first time we meet Zenos again to be him just shirtless with that garlean sweat tech
[2:17:41] <%penitentpentwitch> No, LICK our character
[2:17:42] <Daxalog> This msuic sounds familiar
[2:17:44] <%MisterTylerrr> I'd kiss Zenos...and this stab him
[2:17:45] <+gnoame> He probably will
[2:17:46] <%afronooch> LUL
[2:17:46] <%the38bandit> what if they kill em before 6.0?
[2:17:47] <VukaNGE> what?
[2:17:47] <DetroitSentai> yeah
[2:17:49] <Lt_Campbell> jermaThing
[2:17:49] <lycandruid> do tails smack you if your behind them like in wow?
[2:17:50] <+Neoripo> Zenos Ocelot
[2:17:52] <+LittleBigQuebec> A pure villain
[2:17:55] <DianaTheAscian> YEYEYEYE
[2:17:56] <fug74> just like my fanfics
[2:17:56] <Daxalog> The character tastes like a liar
[2:17:56] <ManfredA> Elidibus outright calls Zenos a beast
[2:17:58] <%LaughingCatt> Kiss & stab at the same time
[2:17:59] <%stabbityrabbit> Why is Pat so horny for this man?
[2:18:01] <%Arxel1> Bruh
[2:18:03] <%weissguard> LUL
[2:18:04] <LilacsandFreedom> can love bloom on the battlefield?
[2:18:04] <nsDrummer> cmonBruh
[2:18:04] <azacca_bitter> Zenos knows the taste of a liar
[2:18:05] <%SpcOpsBear> ewww no, bisexuality is evil is a bad trope
[2:18:05] <Amplificate> Dude look at the name of the main tank the boss has targetted @PatStaresAt
[2:18:05] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> I hope we get a conclusion on the ivalice stinger
[2:18:06] <%stabbityrabbit> Does he wear a tiny hat?
[2:18:07] <vVAstrAVv> no thanks little sun
[2:18:08] <%afronooch> Bruh
[2:18:10] <+MephioTV> "Bruh" vs "Bro..."
[2:18:11] <cyclone722> implying they would animate models touching
[2:18:11] <+crazyspartan214> What if Zenos tries to Game of Throne the WoL.
[2:18:13] <Sydin18> What if the "Bruh" choice makes the moogle noise?
[2:18:14] <%Raiden_Breaker> he gets off to the fighting we can confirm so I can see him doing that creepy crap
[2:18:15] <%Ciglossonjr> BUT CAN I KISS HIM BACK THOUGH
[2:18:16] <CandideCamera> oh so you won't kiss Woolie or Plague but you'll kiss Zenos
[2:18:19] <Daxalog> Cant do it. Lalafell are too small so he cant lean in right
[2:18:22] <%cvp5127> buy me dinner first
[2:18:23] <wirblewomble> What if your warrior of light is gay?
[2:18:26] <AncyentMarinere> Beuh
[2:18:27] <ManfredA> Zenos is ace at best
[2:18:27] <@spacecapncrone> I bet the Ivalice stinger is gonna factor into the Bozjan front storyline
[2:18:30] <Ell1ot> i forgot who Zenos was
[2:18:30] <%aishman> Zeno trying to kiss my Lalafell would be fucking HILARIOUS
[2:18:32] <DianaTheAscian> HA
[2:18:32] <Robot_Nixon_> LUL
[2:18:32] <ManfredA> he has no sexual inclinations
[2:18:32] <+UberWolfman> "WoL wqhat if we kissed under Zodriark? Haha unless...."
[2:18:34] <%penitentpentwitch> "Zenos... did you just nibble on my ear!?"
[2:18:35] <+azure22900> They need to get Zenos to walk up to your headquarters and literally just shatter the land in two, like make him a broken force that will just cause collateral per swing
[2:18:36] <StaticSunrise> there needs tro be a [DRAW WEAPON] prompt somewhere
[2:18:36] <DetroitSentai> @MrFifteenDollarsAnHour The ivalice stinger is the new relic series
[2:18:37] <%weissguard> I want it to be the WoL to say "I've had worse."
[2:18:40] <Daxalog> Who?
[2:18:41] <SoushinSen> just give me back Varis, he was more interesting than Zenos.
[2:18:45] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> zenos just wants power
[2:18:46] <+Neoripo> The other villain should have stayed dead
[2:18:49] <CrypticMochi> Maybe a temporary team up against a bigger threat before you kill him in a bullshit dirty duel
[2:18:52] <MoonKing> all we have left now is chaotic evil. the other two got filled out
[2:18:55] <KoyaMusa> pat your chat hiding image is basically sans how can you say that
[2:18:57] <Razgrizenl> i love zenos just because he is so messed up you cant tell whatt he will do next
[2:19:04] <Lt_Campbell> i cant wait for the Bozja front
[2:19:07] <nsDrummer> middle LUL
[2:19:08] <%MisterTylerrr> @wirblewomble Just cause someone is gay doesn't mean they want to kiss a genocidal, abusive shit bag
[2:19:12] <ManfredA> Varis was more interesting until he was just a fucking cartoon villain
[2:19:16] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> oh word?
[2:19:19] <%LaughingCatt> get outta the way of the fuckin dive bomb
[2:19:27] <+crazyspartan214> Zenos is like Lu Bu. He just wants a decent challanger.
[2:19:37] <+ALazo> Huh. That is not very obvious
[2:19:38] <+Neoripo> LUL
[2:19:38] <%Arxel1> Now THIS is a bruh moment
[2:19:40] <Sydin18> BUT ITS COOL TO STAY IN THE MIDDLE
[2:19:42] <bentarcher> yeah but it's cooler to put up the paladin wings
[2:19:49] <+alphonseisbest> cool guy pat runs ALONE LUL
[2:19:50] <ManfredA> Zenos just wants to be challenged yeah
[2:19:52] <Blackjack760> ^^
[2:19:53] <StaticSunrise> varis went from 0 to 10 to 0 in one cutscene
[2:19:55] <%marsantas> But staying in the middle isn't dangerous at all
[2:19:55] <DianaTheAscian> did that kill back in stormblood? @PatStaresAt
[2:20:02] <lycandruid> and your giving your healers a job to do
[2:20:04] <ManfredA> that's why he's obsessed with the guy who kicked his ass
[2:20:06] <+SH1NK1R0> People still dont know that?
[2:20:10] <%penitentpentwitch> Become what you must, the Speed Bump of Light
[2:20:10] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Yeah, I'm kinda disapointed that Varis really didn't go anywhere after the Race War (TM)
[2:20:11] <+alphonseisbest> nah what pat did was cooler
[2:20:12] <%Ciglossonjr> @PatStaresAt Did you become friends with Zenos or did you deny him? I personally became friends with him
[2:20:29] <Razgrizenl> just finishedthe patch and it was f amazing already have the music scrolls for the new extreme boss its so good <3
[2:20:32] <%LaughingCatt> lobosKek
[2:20:34] <bashful_bard> I really didn't do shit
[2:20:35] <%Laecerelius> So cool, Pat
[2:20:36] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PatStaresAt they need to play up the fact that Zenos wants to get the ultimate boss fight VS you, and is willing to go beyond even what the villains thinks is ok to do so
[2:20:36] <nsDrummer> back in SB staying middle for that dive doesnt kill, it just does a lot more damage
[2:20:43] <floatRand> Unless you are cool class with mana ward >:)
[2:20:46] <+Neoripo> Hunn Bunn LUL
[2:20:46] <+UberWolfman> Wow what a scrub Kappa
[2:20:50] <+alphonseisbest> i think it sucks that we didn't get to fight Varis
[2:20:50] <%Shonen_hero> kind of you to show us an example Kappa
[2:20:53] <+SH1NK1R0> It definitely killed in sb when you were min i level
[2:20:54] <%thegreatbambe> YEa sure Kappa
[2:20:58] <%penitentpentwitch> Simon Says is still dangerous
[2:21:01] <Debauchery_Man> wow ur so good at this very difficult game
[2:21:02] <+gnoame> Yeah, sure, good cover.
[2:21:02] <lycandruid> imagine dying
[2:21:02] <Blackjack760> Kappa
[2:21:08] <floatRand> It's less nerfed and more that you overgear him by default
[2:21:08] <neVan0> Kappa
[2:21:09] <%angel949> Thanks pat big help
[2:21:12] <Daxalog> MP Low
[2:21:13] <%Laecerelius> Healers adjust says Monk Pat
[2:21:13] <Reireizei> Kappa
[2:21:15] <Sydin18> We all kinda was forced to become Benos's friend
[2:21:15] <+crazyspartan214> Kappa
[2:21:18] <DetroitSentai> The boss hasnt been nerfed, ilvl squish just gives bloated stats
[2:21:24] <Razgrizenl> the more you know <3
[2:21:25] <Blackjack760> Sure Kappa
[2:21:25] <StaticSunrise> "muh positionals" is a more believable excuse for dying
[2:21:29] <%MisterTylerrr> Dying is 0 dps, pat
[2:21:50] <StaticSunrise> fuck positionals
[2:21:53] <StaticSunrise> take them out of the game
[2:21:58] <%nobodybutalex> Riddle of earth is great.
[2:22:07] <%MisterTylerrr> Cause DDR
[2:22:08] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt u never about the heavensward 24 mans are they bad?
[2:22:13] <nsDrummer> well monk IS getting a rework next patch
[2:22:19] <%BIumen> It has 6 i think? and it's only two positions between those
[2:22:20] <+ImmaterialHero> nah positionals should be in, just not for Monk
[2:22:23] <vVAstrAVv> id love a NON tank melee with no positionals
[2:22:24] <DetroitSentai> To promote proper use of CDs
[2:22:24] <%the22cstomp> honest question at that point what would range have anymore
[2:22:25] <Lt_Campbell> i like this boss
[2:22:33] <ManfredA> Dun Scaith is still a nightmare
[2:22:34] <%the22cstomp> ranged would actually be completely worse
[2:22:35] <Amplificate> Dun scathe was awesome
[2:22:36] <Aydarkzero> cool boss
[2:22:36] <ManfredA> but it's cool
[2:22:36] <Veluren> MNK's class design still has a lot of 2.0 tax from how they designed the game
[2:22:40] <floatRand> Ozma is real cool and Dun'Scaith's first boss is real fucking cool
[2:22:42] <%penitentpentwitch> Dun Scaith, the Anime Raid
[2:22:43] <bashful_bard> Riddle of earth is insanely valuable in savage
[2:22:45] <bentarcher> Love this track
[2:22:47] <vVAstrAVv> dun scaeths great
[2:22:48] <Blackjack760> god damn ozma
[2:22:49] <%nobodybutalex> Monk positionals make the job more interesting imo.
[2:22:53] <+Ilpala> Dun Scaith went full anime
[2:22:54] <Sydin18> And Cait Sith ONLY EXISTS in that story line lol
[2:22:54] <floatRand> I feel like Diabolos' last phase is just super-meh
[2:22:54] <+UberWolfman> HW alliance was bland
[2:22:54] <ManfredA> Scathach is best girl
[2:22:56] <+Ilpala> you always go full anime
[2:22:59] <nsDrummer> well rip that sch seeing mechanics lol
[2:23:05] <TioXyco> ARgath? you mean ALGUS?
[2:23:05] <nsDrummer> theyre still in cutscene
[2:23:05] <%snugglepuggs> void arc is just the ship from Alien
[2:23:07] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> this whole game is full anime
[2:23:10] <Sydin18> More like Argath the Nerd :)
[2:23:14] <+BloodyBurney> do you think they'll get the VAs for the last Nier raid?
[2:23:16] <rookieknookie> @PatStaresAt what was the Yokai grind like in the good ol days?
[2:23:16] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PatStaresAt i've never fought the actual mini boss between boss 2 and 3 , because at least someone always has the proto ultima quest on them
[2:23:19] <rosemon5001> @PatStaresAt but pat you need to be more honorbru you cant ever have too much samurai gear
[2:23:24] <+XatheFlare> i hate when i text the earth and it leaves me on read
[2:23:28] <Razgrizenl> what old FF content would you like added to ff14 as bosses/raids @PatStaresAt
[2:23:30] <%KishinGrek> Is there a word for the FF boss form that has floating limbs? If not why noy?
[2:23:40] <lycandruid> can you fall off ?
[2:23:46] <%LaughingCatt> you dont need to run away there you just gotta keep moving when it runs off
[2:23:47] <Azathotic> They really should make it so if any player hasnt seen the cutscenes, nobody can enter a battle unless they skip it
[2:23:48] <BluBox> You don't have to flee, just constantly move
[2:23:52] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt when's the earliest I can move back into a zone the enemy is attacking?
[2:23:55] <StaticSunrise> you stack those in the middle you fool
[2:23:56] <%Ciglossonjr> @PatStaresAt Are you going to stream Bozja?
[2:24:01] <%dekkitout> Deadass 🅱️?
[2:24:06] <%the22cstomp> you drop those in the middle
[2:24:08] <%kenstank> I want a Kuja trial
[2:24:09] <nsDrummer> swords go middle......
[2:24:11] <ManfredA> @AncelDeLambert unless it's persistent, as soon as the circle vanishes
[2:24:15] <floatRand> I really like voice-acting in this one
[2:24:16] <%Shonen_hero> oh no
[2:24:26] <%AncelDeLambert> so as soon as the orange drops it's safe?
[2:24:29] <Blackjack760> you drop it in the middle tho

[2:24:46] <floatRand> YOU ARE NOT WELCOME IN MY WORLD. STEP INTO NOTHING

[2:24:49] <JigsK> @AncelDeLambert correct... on most attacks
[2:24:50] <KoyaMusa> hey if you were in orbonne you'd be at your 3rd thundergod attempt so it ain't that bad :^)
[2:24:55] <ManfredA> STEP INTO NOTHING
[2:25:01] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> *Argath's such a cuck
[2:25:04] <%stabbityrabbit> I came into this stream pretty late, has Pat mentioned Brian Mitsoda being kicked from VTMB2 at all?
[2:25:13] <%Valdorick> FUCK YOU ARGATH
[2:25:16] <Sydin18> We gotta stop throwing Ultima around like it's nothing now...
[2:25:18] <%Valdorick> You're a peice of shit!
[2:25:27] <%BIumen> speeeeen
[2:25:34] <%AncelDeLambert> Ultima is supposed to be a magic nuke, ffs
[2:25:41] <Razgrizenl> spinnnnnnnnn
[2:25:50] <%LaughingCatt> I amazed they found a good way to implement Confuse in an MMO
[2:25:57] <ManfredA> this guy literally has some of Ultima's power
[2:25:59] <%AncelDeLambert> don't turn around, cuz you're gonna see my heart breakin'
[2:26:00] <JigsK> honestly i have a lot of fun with the spinny hand
[2:26:01] <Azathotic> @PatStaresAt You using tonfas glam?
[2:26:01] <%MisterTylerrr> turn away, how about I stare at your balls??
[2:26:02] <ManfredA> pls
[2:26:09] <BluBox> Yeah... like Guardian in O7s
[2:26:16] <%Manwad> How does the spinny hand work?
[2:26:21] <SpookyBeef7> Yeah, this encounter left a bad taste in my mouth because I had no idea what was going on.
[2:26:25] <Reireizei> are these basically judge laws? o.o
[2:26:32] <Daxalog> Any sprouts?

[2:27:05] <%SomeSageAdvice> i keep hearing the sound effect go of and looking at my chat to see who is whispering me since thats the one i have set for it lol
[2:27:05] <%MisterTylerrr> Do buffs effect your LB damage?
[2:27:10] <+Neoripo> Hit LB 4
[2:27:13] <Blackjack760> no
[2:27:15] <ManfredA> no
[2:27:18] <KoyaMusa> can ranged and casters stop spamming lb button and give the melee a chance
[2:27:19] <ManfredA> LB damage is consistent
[2:27:20] <floatRand> Oh boy now it is time for my ingame movie for free exp
[2:27:22] <Ell1ot> i never know when or if i should LB
[2:27:29] <+ConLin_Arts_> that is a weird Monk setup
[2:27:32] <BluBox> Enlightenment is like the one good one lol
[2:27:34] <%KishinGrek> Nice
[2:27:45] <%afronooch> but the desynth tho
[2:27:46] <ManfredA> in 99% of content just LB whenever if you're not healer or tank
[2:27:46] <@spacecapncrone> you got your hadoken
[2:27:49] <%gespenst25> Pat how TF did yo get into an alliance raid that isn't LOTA?
[2:27:49] <$KnivesEve> @Ell1ot same
[2:27:50] <Azathotic> @Ell1ot Are you a DPS? Melee DPS? Is the LB full three levels? Use it
[2:27:50] <steamlord23> I started last week and I'm a bit confused on what class to focus on. I've tried a bit of each role, but...yeah, not sure what to commit too lol
[2:27:56] <ManfredA> in dungeons casters lb packs
[2:28:01] <%Valdorick> LUL
[2:28:03] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> I want to see Judge implemented as a proper class. You could do a lot w/ the law and penalty system
[2:28:14] <ZeterZero > It's weird how much I am simultaneously happy I got out of XIV and somehow also miss it.
[2:28:21] <%walternatorz> @PatStaresAt you needed to call out mechanics sooner. I got hit by too many
[2:28:25] <+Neoripo> Effing roll
[2:28:27] <BluBox> TOXIC
[2:28:28] <%Ciglossonjr> @PatStaresAt Yo pat are you going to stream Bozja?
[2:28:33] <nsDrummer> is the raid going very badly? dont dps lb, save it for healers
[2:28:34] <+alphonseisbest> LUL
[2:28:34] <Azathotic> @Ell1ot Alternatively, any DPS. Melee LB just does more damage than Caster/Ranged DPS, although not by a crazy amont
[2:28:38] <+BloodyBurney> why do people not roll
[2:28:39] <+pandamancer224> damn

[2:29:32] <+pandamancer224> idyllshire
[2:29:36] <XyraFhoan> they nerfed demicrystals a ton yeah

[2:29:53] <XyraFhoan> they nerfed it in 5.3
[2:29:58] <+Basilias_Maximus> Being able to fly in Revenant's Toll is weird.
[2:30:01] <+TheDestinyPotato> RIP demicyrstals
[2:30:03] <Lt_Campbell> i sell dirt
[2:30:06] <KoyaMusa> oh they nerfed it?
[2:30:08] <%LaughingCatt> just by equipment & desynth them
[2:30:08] <%walternatorz> just farm up anima weapons
[2:30:15] <MrYoke> demis are dead, sell for 50 gil
[2:30:17] <DetroitSentai> poetics are for level up desynth
[2:30:20] <nsDrummer> they made it easier to get the crystals
[2:30:21] <+ConLin_Arts_> Furry Land

[2:31:27] <%Manwad> time travel, got it
[2:31:32] <DetroitSentai> You can make good money doing maps
[2:31:32] <floatRand> Maps?
[2:31:35] <nsDrummer> you really only make the best money at cap
[2:31:37] <floatRand> Probably
[2:31:41] <@spacecapncrone> do maps at the beginning of a patch, get the rare crafting material and sell it for millions
[2:31:41] <Robot_Nixon_> just be rich 4Head
[2:31:42] <SpookyBeef7> I just sell crafter materia. quiettShrug
[2:31:54] <$Thatghostpepper> OR treasure maps and selling the items there
[2:31:54] <+alphonseisbest> I CAN'T TIME TRAVEL IM BROKE LUL
[2:31:56] <%Typhaeon> I'm dumb and struggle with money as a pentameld omni
[2:31:57] <%a_goth_pancake> you know they meant now, you chose.
[2:31:58] <Azathotic> I've been told furniture is better for making gil than the usual gear shit
[2:32:02] <%terminallyCapriciousz> just get given gold
[2:32:02] <MrYoke> To make money, you don't tell people how you make money'
[2:32:02] <+ImmaterialHero> you will make virtually no money outside of maps if you aren't doing 70-80 crafts
[2:32:05] <Sydin18> Just Scaith
[2:32:06] <%Typhaeon> Just be good at reading the marketboard all day
[2:32:07] <DetroitSentai> @spacecapncrone Even old maps still have good mats that sell for 100k+ on MB
[2:32:08] <%a_goth_pancake> chode
[2:32:10] <+BloodyBurney> most classic gil-making schemes kinda died with the crafter rework
[2:32:11] <XyraFhoan> once you beat 3.3 you can do Ishgard restoration, get skybuilder scrips and start cranking out items from that, like the dyes and stuff
[2:32:14] <nsDrummer> maps are good money, but you need to be 80
[2:32:26] <@spacecapncrone> That's true, especially if people stop doing the old maps
[2:32:27] <ZeterZero > Being able to switch classes on the fly is the BEST
[2:32:29] <+brandonsbetow> yokai farming?
[2:32:58] <bashful_bard> Spamming diadem on btn or mnr can earn a fuckton of seals to buy mounts. I got like 20 mounts to sell in season 1
[2:33:04] <DetroitSentai> You do not need to do 80 maps, 70 and 60 maps and even some 50 still have mats worth good money. Also going far in the map dungeon drops large ammounts of gill anyways
[2:33:13] <%MisterTylerrr> It was doing that to me a second ago
[2:33:31] <%kenstank> yeah mariner cloth is still like 200k a piece

[2:34:48] <KahnWick> I hate yokai grinding with the new 4 remaining, only to be distracted by Triple Triad because the Ironworks hand won't drop his goddamn Omega Card
[2:34:51] <Explodincatz> horny on page
[2:34:57] <%lucidrush> Hes trying to get the baby out through your butt
[2:35:04] <ZeterZero > Anal dwelling butt dog
[2:35:04] <$Thatghostpepper> gief's a leg and butt guy
[2:35:05] <%Typhaeon> Pat was born via the butt canal
[2:35:07] <+dredgyboi> ew buttjizz
[2:35:10] <%cowardman93> "ew"
[2:35:11] <heartlesshealer> THE DEEP SOUTH
[2:35:14] <thememeticwind> I feel your pain KahnWick
[2:35:16] <+pandamancer224> ashes to ashes, butts to butts
[2:35:17] <Azathotic> ...Paige gave ass-birth to Pat?!?
[2:35:22] <nsDrummer> its better than it was tho
[2:35:22] <Blackjack760> THE DEEP SOUTH
[2:35:30] <SpookyBeef7> You literally just alternate between Freeze and Flare.
[2:35:35] <ManfredA> @PatStaresAt back at the beginning of 5.0 I would hit over 40k in aoe in expert
[2:35:38] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PatStaresAt shove a fire 3 between thunder 4 and flare
[2:35:39] <nsDrummer> flare Kreygasm
[2:35:42] <ManfredA> as BLM
[2:35:46] <%terminallyCapriciousz> paige is pat's alt timeline mom?!?!?!?!?
[2:35:47] <%LaughingCatt> big dmg
[2:35:49] <SpookyBeef7> Compared to before it's hilarious mindless.
[2:35:51] <ZeterZero > Is that how you do the hustle?
[2:35:52] <vVAstrAVv> THUNDER 4
[2:35:54] <Daxalog> Fire Fire Fire Ice Ice Ice Thats it
[2:35:55] <+LittleBigQuebec> more damage
[2:35:55] <nsDrummer> free dmg
[2:35:57] <KoyaMusa> thunder aoe dot
[2:35:57] <2DSuperiority> more fore
[2:35:59] <floatRand> For 3 Astral Fire
[2:36:00] <%thegreatbambe> thunder 4 is a dps lost
[2:36:00] <+CaptainJax> Don't forget Thunder 3
[2:36:02] <ManfredA> you switch with fire 3 if you have triplecast/swiftcast up
[2:36:12] <KahnWick> @thememeticwind I hate triple triad, I love it so much
[2:36:14] <ManfredA> otherwise switch with flare
[2:36:17] <+LittleBigQuebec> then skip thunder 4, but still shove a fire 3
[2:36:18] <vVAstrAVv> thunder 4 is really strong with stormcloud
[2:36:22] <%Rumbutt> Sharpcast your Thunder 4 and then just use the proc right away, big damage
[2:36:24] <DetroitSentai> You always switch with F3
[2:36:24] <+LittleBigQuebec> you get the fire amp on the flare
[2:36:25] <%MegboyManuel> here come the Balance nerds
[2:36:26] <+CaptainJax> you can prepull sharpcast thunder 4
[2:36:44] <nsDrummer> yeah stormcloud thunder 4 is really good
[2:36:48] <+Neoripo> The pixie sidequests in here are NEFARIOUS
[2:36:52] <nsDrummer> thundercloud*
[2:36:53] <ManfredA> you switch with flare without fast casting because it's equivalent dps
[2:36:57] <ZeterZero > Wish google docs had a dark mode.
[2:37:01] <+DevinMayCry> I thought Pat was grinding Yo-kai for a moment
[2:37:13] <%terminallyCapriciousz> i wish everything had a dark mkdr
[2:37:15] <ZeterZero > So I wouldn't be blinded every time I try to write.
[2:37:18] <%MisterTylerrr> That bear can't help it, he's possessed
[2:37:23] <+CaptainJax> Did Pat beat EX Seat of Sacrifice yet?
[2:37:34] <DetroitSentai> There's no reason to raw a Flare from ice, the damage is so much less
[2:37:43] <%MegboyManuel> yeah Pat, you beat the latest EX yet?
[2:37:48] <%Theycallmenerf> Theycallmenerf subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! 8 months! Hopefully I’m still here for another 8!
[2:37:55] <heartlesshealer> silly pat, playing mnk
[2:38:02] <ZeterZero > @terminallyCapriciousz Valid
[2:38:02] <ManfredA> yes but the damage is equivalent because you save time from hardcasting 2 flares
[2:38:05] <+LittleBigQuebec> time to get Holmenster switch Kappa
[2:38:06] <floatRand> Yeah, potency is just 380 doing it raw from umbral ice
[2:38:07] <KnightAsteran> jesus pat, set you gear sets on a hotbar somewhere so you dont have to go menu diving for them
[2:38:11] <DetroitSentai> Pat all those sidequests are free scaled XP
[2:38:12] <ManfredA> dps is not just big numbers
[2:38:14] <%walternatorz> sound logic
[2:38:15] <+DevinMayCry> We are a reclusive brotherhood
[2:38:16] <metalsiren31> Me and Warrior
[2:38:19] <%Laecerelius> until 6.0 comes out!
[2:38:22] <Azathotic> WHY IS IT ALWAYS THE DPS WHO NEVER HITS IT????
[2:38:25] <KoyaMusa> i can't believe that demicrystal thing passed me by, i earned passive millions that way
[2:38:28] <+alphonseisbest> UNTIdl 6.0
[2:38:30] <Aydarkzero> 2?
[2:38:31] <%MisterTylerrr> I already got mine to level 80. Ready for the revamp
[2:38:32] <floatRand> Sidequest exp is still pretty bad. At 79 10 quests is just 4mil or so.
[2:38:35] <%SirGO0SE> i mean he's right
[2:38:37] <ManfredA> oh no not the worst ShB dungeon
[2:38:38] <%AncelDeLambert> even I have a gear set for every crafting class
[2:38:40] <ZeterZero > 74
[2:38:40] <+LittleBigQuebec> OH GOD IT'S DOHN MHEG
[2:38:41] <+DevinMayCry> The DPS is literally asleep
[2:38:41] <%SirGO0SE> one that you can scroll?
[2:38:42] <+brandonsbetow> Why is it everyone I know hates monk
[2:38:43] <floatRand> If they just gave bicolored gemstones as well....
[2:38:43] <ZeterZero > Oh I was wrong
[2:38:44] <cyclone722> >controller
[2:38:45] <+DevinMayCry> LITERALLY fell asleep

[2:38:46] <%thegreatbambe> Yea and you got 32 hot bar spaces
[2:38:49] <%GalacticLatte> oh cool tonfa
[2:38:49] <%Laecerelius> the other dps probably either was afk or in the middle of doing something else
[2:38:50] <Blackjack760> OH NO

[2:39:41] <ManfredA> it's not
[2:39:46] <+BloodyBurney> worse than Totorak!?
[2:39:47] <ManfredA> it's equivalent
[2:39:47] <%valriot> SMALL PULLS OMEGALUL
[2:39:49] <Blackjack760> that ravel
[2:39:50] <%GarbageNirvana> "Worst dungeon in the game" is pretty strong words for a game that also has Aurum Vale
[2:39:53] <+MrFifteenDollarsAnHour> isn't the lakeland one first
[2:39:55] <StaticSunrise> no part, that's aurum vale and you know it
[2:39:55] <Lt_Campbell> LUL silly Fuath pranks
[2:39:55] <DetroitSentai> No it isnt
[2:40:01] <%LaughingCatt> just like Bardam before it LUL
[2:40:05] <%JumboCrunchies> How does Monk feel, after the changes?
[2:40:07] <DetroitSentai> This dungeon does not beat upgraded 70 gear
[2:40:11] <ManfredA> check his geatr
[2:40:11] <%afronooch> small pulls are slow but safe, i respect it
[2:40:15] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt hey pat, is the free trial good enough to get a good feel for the game? I'm super new to the mmo genre
[2:40:16] <%Chichen> he has a hive weapon, i dont think he's a jumper
[2:40:19] <nsDrummer> slow and steady is fine for sure
[2:40:20] <KoyaMusa> its still less time than a wipe would waste
[2:40:20] <ManfredA> if he has the alliance ring he's a jumper
[2:40:21] <+Neoripo> Cautious paladin
[2:40:22] <%AncelDeLambert> hey he's a paladin, he's fine
[2:40:22] <aeonicvector> its also the first dungeon with REAL tankbusters on trash
[2:40:27] <+CaptainJax> it is now
[2:40:28] <$apolitenoob> @GarbageNirvana Wasn't Aurum Vale just nerfed in some way?
[2:40:28] <nsDrummer> it sure is NOW
[2:40:28] <+zepelinnn1> if they cant even AOE trash pulls just refund man
[2:40:29] <%valriot> WHY IS THE FUCKING WHITE MAGE USING GLARE AND NOT HOLY FUCKCKKKK
[2:40:31] <%AncelDeLambert> free trial is now HUGE
[2:40:36] <vVAstrAVv> but wipes reset your cooldowns
[2:40:37] <+SH1NK1R0> Mnk change hasnt happened
[2:40:37] <+DevinMayCry> The free trial is TWO ENTIRE GAMES
[2:40:38] <lucky_icarus> But to be fair, they shouldn't be single pulling THIS FAR into the game.
[2:40:39] <+alphonseisbest> YEP
[2:40:40] <SpookyBeef7> The fact he isn't overpulling is actually really nice to see. Most tanks I encounter just pull everything like dumbasses and get themselves killed or make the healer overwork to cover their dumbfuckery.
[2:40:43] <%cowardman93> dude I'm on 360 hours and JUST got out of the free trial
[2:40:45] <DetroitSentai> Free trial is up to 60
[2:40:45] <Vashido22> thats good to know
[2:40:46] <floatRand> Note, you have to just get past lv35 hump
[2:40:46] <%KishinGrek> geez Pat Paige is right there
[2:40:47] <vVAstrAVv> balls to the walls
[2:40:47] <$Thatghostpepper> @Vashido22 yes you're getting 2 games in that trial
[2:40:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> for free
[2:40:50] <+DevinMayCry> Its literally 2 Final Fantasy games for free
[2:40:51] <+ZipperHands> it's like a 100 hours worth of content FOR FREE
[2:40:54] <Daxalog> Early game is kinda boring. But it IS an MMO. So yknow
[2:40:54] <nsDrummer> free trial is level 60 now with HW included
[2:40:56] <Vashido22> fucking sick
[2:40:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> 4 free
[2:40:58] <+CaptainJax> I wonder if any free trial nerds have gotten the Morbol mount yet
[2:40:59] <%terminallyCapriciousz> free trial is BIG HUGE. its literally two whole ff games
[2:41:00] <%GarbageNirvana> @GarbageNirvana I mean maybe, I haven't played in a minute
[2:41:03] <aeonicvector> its, based on how you calculate it, HALF the game
[2:41:05] <%AncelDeLambert> wtf are these party trees
[2:41:05] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt hey Pat am i a asshole for never doing big pulls unless the healer says so?
[2:41:09] <Blackjack760> ITS FREE REALESTATE
[2:41:10] <+DevinMayCry> 100 before grinding out anything else too
[2:41:11] <KoyaMusa> yeah it leaves you on a cliffhanger to the not as good story
[2:41:13] <%SirGO0SE> heavensword is when the story get good?
[2:41:13] <%AncelDeLambert> the trees are popping streamers LUL
[2:41:14] <2DSuperiority> TEST TIME

[2:41:14] <Tomschiii> nah, hw was rather ok

[2:41:17] <heartlesshealer> OH BOY
[2:41:17] <%AncelDeLambert> uh oh
[2:41:18] <SpookyBeef7> I may have spoke too soon.
[2:41:21] <nsDrummer> interupt that man!
[2:41:23] <%AncelDeLambert> CAN HE DO IT
[2:41:24] <+LittleBigQuebec> TIME FOR DIE
[2:41:24] <Aydarkzero> are they running towards the enemies?
[2:41:25] <DianaTheAscian> OH FUN
[2:41:26] <%FroggoPrince> I see that Hallowed Ground
[2:41:26] <Coliaki> blue mages requires SB, so no morbol, no
[2:41:26] <nimu290> fuck
[2:41:27] <+SinisterBroccoli> it'll be fine pat
[2:41:27] <+DevinMayCry> Pat chill its gonna be fine
[2:41:28] <+pandamancer224> second to SHB
[2:41:29] <ManfredA> he popped Hallowed
[2:41:29] <+ALazo> Did something ever come out of the Paige FF14 discussion?
[2:41:29] <%the22cstomp> he hallowed he might be good

[2:41:31] <%valriot> BITCH USE HOLY
[2:41:32] <%asgard147> IT'S TIME
[2:41:33] <$JamJamX3> @PatStaresAt Did you ever have problems regarding inventory when it came to managing crafting/gathering and your battle gear?
[2:41:33] <%AncelDeLambert> huh, apparently he can
[2:41:33] <Azathotic> @SirGO0SE JESUS YES
[2:41:33] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt he's using defensive cooldowns, you gonna be fine
[2:41:34] <+Neoripo> You where the chosen one PLD!
[2:41:34] <%nimu290> why he do that
[2:41:34] <DianaTheAscian> looks fine
[2:41:35] <%Aeogard> i thought he wasnt gonne do dungeons with monk
[2:41:36] <ManfredA> he knows how to tank
[2:41:36] <@spacecapncrone> c'mon dude, interrupts pls
[2:41:37] <%the22cstomp> HE KNOWS
[2:41:37] <%AncelDeLambert> this guy knows his pace
[2:41:38] <$Thatghostpepper> and the trial ends on a good note
[2:41:38] <heartlesshealer> DON'T SAY IT
[2:41:39] <+zepelinnn1> its just a trash pull my dude
[2:41:41] <+crazyspartan214> BibleThump shlebSWEAT shlebSWEAT
[2:41:41] <SpookyBeef7> Well, PLD, probably would be better at this then.
[2:41:43] <+alphonseisbest> IT'LL BE FINE
[2:41:44] <%afronooch> HW compared to ARR is great. HW compared to SB and ShB? ehhh
[2:41:45] <%Raiden_Breaker> white mage should take it
[2:41:47] <+DevinMayCry> Slam those MNK AOEs
[2:41:51] <%valriot> ACTUALLY USING COOLDOWN PogChamp
[2:41:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> all in luck
[2:41:53] <+BloodyBurney> Hallowed ground wore off
[2:41:53] <Lt_Campbell> Red mage aint doing nothin
[2:41:56] <Daxalog> Is their any reason to ever use your auto attack?
[2:41:56] <ManfredA> nah he's doing cooldown rotations
[2:41:57] <%nobodybutalex> pat forgot about his twin snakes buff sbfpRichard
[2:41:57] <Azathotic> Honestly, a good healer can offset a bad tank, youll just lose some DPS
[2:41:58] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt tank ACTUALLY using cooldowns
[2:42:01] <%JumboCrunchies> Healers Mana is near full. That tank is just doing a pretty decent job
[2:42:03] <%SirGO0SE> @Azathotic ill bookmark that for when to stop skipping cutscenes then ty
[2:42:03] <%Tenkay> Nah the tank is probably an alt he hallowed this pull
[2:42:04] <nsDrummer> no interupts tho NotLikeThis
[2:42:09] <Aydarkzero> competent players PogChamp
[2:42:10] <+CaptainJax> He used Arm's Length PogChamp
[2:42:12] <+DevinMayCry> Which, really weird seeing other peoples hotbars and how diferent they are. Mines all jacked from years of keeping moves mostly same place for 6 years
[2:42:13] <Drusain> I've been going back to free trial after not playing since 2017. My RP reason that I stopped was PTSD after the sad shit that happens after Titan
[2:42:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> POG
[2:42:24] <Blackjack760> He's a gamer
[2:42:25] <nsDrummer> slow pulling at 80 LUL
[2:42:25] <+SinisterBroccoli> I just did the new dungeon with a tank that used no cooldowns
[2:42:26] <%Chichen> Wait what
[2:42:27] <Lt_Campbell> red mage
[2:42:27] <%Chichen> chicheThink

[2:42:30] <Aydarkzero> Pat is the new player Kappa
[2:42:32] <%DensityD> PogChamp
[2:42:33] <aeonicvector> Healer isnt holying, maybe healer?
[2:42:34] <+zepelinnn1> it was YOU all along
[2:42:35] <%FroggoPrince> might be the healer
[2:42:35] <DianaTheAscian> red mage?
[2:42:41] <+ElMangoes> Dropping GL elmangSadCat
[2:42:42] <@spacecapncrone> everyone's capped except you
[2:42:43] <+UberWolfman> RDM?
[2:42:44] <+LittleBigQuebec> THE ROAD THAT WE WALK
[2:42:44] <%FroggoPrince> would explain the slow pull to begin
[2:42:45] <Blackjack760> it was Pat all along
[2:42:45] <Aydarkzero> SourPls
[2:42:46] <KoyaMusa> nah the healer used holy
[2:42:47] <%asgard147> is it you? Kappa
[2:42:52] <floatRand> Healer is holying, but the effect is just disabled
[2:42:53] <%weissguard> If it's the WHM, I'm gonna be a little proud.
[2:42:58] <%MisterTylerrr> It's you..YOU ARE NEW!!
[2:42:59] <$JamJamX3> @PatStaresAt Did you ever have problems regarding inventory when it came to managing crafting/gathering and your battle gear?
[2:43:00] <Azathotic> @SirGO0SE When a chick named Lady Iceheart shows up after the final boss of ARR, pay attention. Also pay attention to the final bosses in ARR, even if they dont seem important now
[2:43:00] <Reireizei> wait did they change the midboss music!?
[2:43:03] <Aydarkzero> Red Mage looks fun
[2:43:03] <+SH1NK1R0> Lol just assumed it was the tank
[2:43:06] <+SinisterBroccoli> Pat didn't you say you weren't doing dungeons with Monk?
[2:43:07] <ColRedyx> Yeah definitely the red mage.
[2:43:09] <@spacecapncrone> form shift, lad
[2:43:12] <ASleepySnek> coward
[2:43:12] <%FroggoPrince> @Reireizei yea

[2:46:00] <%KishinGrek> so posh guys lol
[2:46:03] <+AlexanderEspen> Looks like the tank was just as worried about the new player message as pat
[2:46:03] <%king_wragles> Like... for cutting wood?
[2:46:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Wendy's breakfast has to be good, too many places got breakfast on lock now
[2:46:05] <%FroggoPrince> yo he using Arm's Length I love it
[2:46:09] <%stabbityrabbit> Dear lord, I've never heard such pure joy for Wendy's.
[2:46:11] <%penitentpentwitch> More than anything, it's the "Trauma Tethers" boss that makes or breaks groups for this dungeon
[2:46:15] <Srthunda> dont jinx it
[2:46:16] <Vengie14> Did an entire Toto-Rak run with the tank never putting on tank stance
[2:46:17] <%cowardman93> England is truly cursed because we have no Wendys
[2:46:22] <%AncelDeLambert> for those unaware, Pat once dressed up as a cheap ass saw for Halloween
[2:46:23] <+CaptainJax> Tank knows about Arm's Length shit is now easy
[2:46:29] <%a_goth_pancake> I bet it's the most gourmet Wendy's on the continent.
[2:46:30] <%VioletHeart> Sounds like a blessing to me.
[2:46:31] <2DSuperiority> all it takes is to watch a youtube video if you're new
[2:46:39] <+azure22900> nandos though

[2:46:42] <%AzureGale> You're not missing much :x
[2:46:47] <lucky_icarus> God, it's odd how rare it is to have a tank that uses reprise and arms length.
[2:46:51] <AdjustKiefer> It gave YOu wendys so maybe?
[2:46:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> No the nritish empire made Canada Possible
[2:46:53] <Tomschiii> isnt wendys just something americano?
[2:46:55] <%asgard147> no FeelsBadMan
[2:46:56] <aeonicvector> Yes ut was, we needed a stepping stone towards wendys
[2:46:59] <%penitentpentwitch> The true reason the British Empire expanded: They sought out lands rich in Wendy's
[2:47:01] <%kenstank> one time I tanked this dungeon and the healer kept running ahead to grab wall to wall mobs which they then failed to heal me through lol
[2:47:08] <@spacecapncrone> the changes to Reprisal to make it an AoE are *delicious*
[2:47:14] <Drusain> If I'm starting the game should I single or double pull as tank?
[2:47:22] <KoyaMusa> its weird now with all poetics items being automatically augmented, it means you can't get two tome rings anymore, a little annoying for gear
[2:47:26] <%walternatorz> Wendy's is orphan food.
[2:47:28] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat There is a Denny's in Wales
[2:47:30] <%NopeBadguy> That change is two patches old now
[2:47:30] <nsDrummer> its a SHB change isnt it?
[2:47:31] <+ImmaterialHero> they made that change at 5.1
[2:47:31] <@spacecapncrone> they're still delicious though
[2:47:34] <%AzureGale> WELL, THEY'RE STILL GOOD CHANGES
[2:47:39] <+Neoripo> SINGLE
[2:47:41] <DetroitSentai> 5.0 change so over a year
[2:47:42] <+DevinMayCry> They are getting rid of greased lightning... sort of...
[2:47:46] <Azathotic> @Drusain Single pull. You need to crawl before you walk. Your party wont mind
[2:47:47] <%BIumen> monk aesthetic is all over the place but also that's part of its lore? so it's difficult
[2:47:48] <%NopeBadguy> Just give monk a raging demon
[2:47:49] <%MisterTylerrr> I'm excited to be a monk main
[2:47:50] <%JumboCrunchies> Did the MNK changes help even a little?
[2:47:51] <%JeanGardner99> Dark Knight is the shit, I'm glad my static bullied me to play it
[2:47:54] <aeonicvector> @Drusain Double is standard, but single if your not confident in your cooldown use
[2:47:57] <Lt_Campbell> fun fact, when i first started tanking i didnt know that arms length caused slow
[2:47:58] <+zepelinnn1> monk sucking sucks
[2:48:01] <DetroitSentai> Monk is in that weird, a ton of effort for not the best damage
[2:48:03] <SpookyBeef7> I think they're planning on something for MNK, likely for 5.4.
[2:48:05] <+ALazo> I started with monk because I love the aesthetic. But now all other dps classes feel like weird mutants to me.
[2:48:07] <+DevinMayCry> Thge MNK changes havent happened yet. 5.4
[2:48:10] <+BloodyBurney> looking forward to 5.4, NIN got a great rework
[2:48:10] <+ImmaterialHero> @PatStaresAt how do you feel about them making the mid-boss theme of SHB an Insatiable remix? I feel like the song was better before that.
[2:48:11] <vVAstrAVv> get RID OF GREASED LIGHTENING????
[2:48:11] <%NopeBadguy> It exists to give your party Brotherhood
[2:48:11] <saraizarai> Greassed lightning is becoming a passive in 5,4
[2:48:16] <%LaughingCatt> being cool fantasy punch man should be awesome but there's so much annoying crap in Monk's move set
[2:48:16] <+SH1NK1R0> Yeah arms length is a hella underrated cd
[2:48:20] <$crusader_raul> @PatStaresAt are these your friends youre playing with?
[2:48:20] <+DevinMayCry> GL is turning into a trait and shit
[2:48:23] <Klefth> Oh my goodness!! I just got LoTA....
[2:48:23] <%kenstank> DRK was my favorite tank until Gunbreaky~
[2:48:24] <vVAstrAVv> gl 4 is a blast you psycho
[2:48:27] <StaticSunrise> melee DPS is ruined by positionals
[2:48:29] <%NopeBadguy> "WHY DO I EXIST" "You give a raid buff" "OH MY GOD"
[2:48:29] <+DevinMayCry> Dont take away my quick attacks
[2:48:34] <%MisterTylerrr> Pat has friends?
[2:48:37] <+zepelinnn1> @Lt_Campbellthey really should force you to read the tooltips somehow
[2:48:38] <+dropthebehelit> I NEVER want to play Monk because of how it plays, only because I think it's cool to be punch girl. I always switch back after a few hrs
[2:48:38] <+DevinMayCry> Remove the riddle of fire slowdown
[2:48:39] <%walternatorz> now they are best friends
[2:48:43] <+DevinMayCry> MAKE US FASTER
[2:48:45] <@spacecapncrone> just give Monk Hundred Fists and call it a day
[2:48:47] <+smevvster> Anyone who hasn't actually played MNK at 80 and moans about MNK gameplay doesn't *actually* know what's wrong with them.
[2:48:49] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> The monk opener has way to much RNG right now
[2:48:52] <ManfredA> @DevinMayCry that's been gone for a long time
[2:48:55] <SpookyBeef7> Dude, if Greased Lightning gets turned into a passive trait and not something you have to constantly maintain that'd be huge.
[2:49:01] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt r u gonna show off the 5.3 trial?
[2:49:02] <$erkman3stax> @mistertylerrr he use to have super best friends.......see what I did there
[2:49:11] <Lt_Campbell> BTW Pat thanks for turning me onto tales from DF
[2:49:17] <floatRand> Man, I forgot how long Nero's salty bitching about Gaius-sama not noticing him was.
[2:49:21] <%valriot> Monk has like 5 skills THATS A FUCKING POINTLESS
[2:49:22] <+DevinMayCry> @ManfredA Oh damn did it?
[2:49:23] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt You use them to end the fight/phase for a big boost of DPS.
[2:49:25] <Azathotic> I dont like the multihit Monk skills, it throws off my timing
[2:49:25] <+alphonseisbest> @pat staresat as a returning player who loves DRK any advice For remembering old dungeon mechanics?
[2:49:27] <BluBox> True
[2:49:27] <+Neoripo> TRUE
[2:49:30] <%dekkitout> Those were words I understand 🙃
[2:49:32] <%MisterTylerrr> "Here are your most powerful techniques, they ruin your dps."
[2:49:32] <%weissguard> So this boss is a yikes for randos, isn't it?
[2:49:34] <KoyaMusa> nah you can understand what is bad with monk not at cap
[2:49:39] <ManfredA> RoF is just a straight buff now
[2:49:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> monk apologists
[2:49:51] <$crusader_raul> @PatStaresAt Have any interest in Baldur's Gate iii?
[2:49:52] <%the38bandit> how are gettinng into dungeons so fast with dps?
[2:49:57] <+ALazo> I don't understand what they're used for. Therefore I never use them.
[2:50:02] <%NopeBadguy> As long as you're aware what they're used for
[2:50:05] <%penitentpentwitch> I hope they buff MCH flamethrower
[2:50:08] <+smevvster> Can't wait for the MNK rework to hit, and people STILL moan because "boo fucking hoo I need to land positionals BibleThump"
[2:50:13] <azacca_bitter> let my monster grooooooow!
[2:50:17] <+UberWolfman> GOTTOM
[2:50:18] <@spacecapncrone> make Hundred Fists a buff that makes every Monk ability an OGCD and let 'em go fuckin wild.
[2:50:19] <+DevinMayCry> Old monk yells at non existant clouds
[2:50:20] <+Neoripo> Only brotherhood is good and it is a goddamn buff
[2:50:21] <Psych_man13_13> Pat, would you recommend the Square Enix or Steam version?
[2:50:23] <+BloodyBurney> most jobs don't have entire skills dedicated to fringe situations
[2:50:24] <KoyaMusa> i like insatiable but its a little draining now that EVERY boss uses it
[2:50:27] <%NopeBadguy> The only positional that's actually important now is just fucking Bootshine
[2:50:29] <SummonerMagno> so close
[2:50:38] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I main monk, Yeah Tornado kick is actual fucking trash, even at the end of my burst phase
[2:50:47] <%NopeBadguy> PUNCH THESE VINES
[2:50:50] <%JumboCrunchies> @Psych_man13_13 if you're talking about 14, they're the exact same.
[2:50:57] <ManfredA> Tornado Kick just feels bad to use
[2:51:13] <%LaughingCatt> Samurai had a skill used only for downtown & the changed to be useful in the next patch, why does Monk have at least FOUR skills based around downtime
[2:51:14] <ManfredA> also nice name @AlteisenReiseZ I love the Alt
[2:51:14] <rekinom> *breathes in* WE FALLLLLLLLLLLLL
[2:51:16] <Dieworc> i play monk at 80. it sucks. GL is annyoing to maintain and so many of our abilities are useless. 80% of our dps is from bootshine alone.
[2:51:29] <+DevinMayCry> Mantra is an underrated buff
[2:51:35] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt You use Perfect Balance to quickly switch between Dragon Kick and Bootshine for big crit back positionals
[2:51:36] <+smevvster> @Psych_man13_13 Do *not* use the Steam version. Of course, gameplay they're all the same, but the steam version puts bizzaro hurdles in front of you if you want to purchase any microtransactions and don't do it in the "right way"
[2:51:41] <Coliaki> build stacks or alternate dragon kick/bootshine
[2:51:42] <%nimu290> this music not bad
[2:51:43] <+DevinMayCry> GL is easier than ever to maintain though
[2:51:48] <2DSuperiority> the Pat grows
[2:51:48] <bashful_bard> I use it to hit GL4 ans TK only
[2:51:51] <Floofiie> PB bootshine DK bootshine DK bootshine DK
[2:51:51] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Dragoon mains, how do you like the job?
[2:51:52] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @manfreda thank you thank you
[2:51:53] <ManfredA> yep
[2:51:56] <+DevinMayCry> It becomes easier to keep stacks of GL every time
[2:52:02] <ManfredA> just dragon kick into bootshine
[2:52:14] <KoyaMusa> yeah, it sucks, but its a big dps gain
[2:52:19] <%NopeBadguy> TAHT'S IT
[2:52:23] <+SlashHabit> what's this? looks booooooooooooooring
[2:52:24] <+Neoripo> @Psych_man13_13 Whichever version you pick, you have to commit. SE version has discounts sometimes tho
[2:52:27] <ManfredA> it was a lot cooler in SB
[2:52:28] <%NopeBadguy> You can also use it for recovery, but you shouldn't
[2:52:29] <Azathotic> @Psych_man13_13 Square version goes on better sales more often, Steam version is literally the same thing but its locked to Steam (cant buy non-steam expansions for it), all it does is download the launcher/updater
[2:52:29] <%BIumen> it also lets you put down the DOT early and spam snap punch
[2:52:30] <VidulaSaix> Yeah why do you think no one plays Monk LUL
[2:52:31] <%Kinoskae> Dragoon is awesome @amanishouseofnonsense
[2:52:33] <+doodoo_tummy> you do that and then forget to refresh GL at the end of it and lose it
[2:52:42] <17sevens> what i just get to use bloodspiller? borrinnggg
[2:52:42] <+smevvster> Well, you also need to think about making sure to have your DoTs and buffs up before throwing it out.
[2:52:42] <%MisterRockett> BEN SHAPIRO OWNED HIMSELF AGAIN
[2:52:45] <Klefth> No, it's to spam bootshine crits with the leaden fist buff
[2:52:46] <bashful_bard> Yes
[2:52:47] <Blackjack760> yes tongain stack
[2:52:48] <KoyaMusa> there's a reason i dropped monk this expansion
[2:52:53] <%penitentpentwitch> In other news, MNK is getting a rework for many good reasons
[2:52:59] <+DevinMayCry> Its actually one of the cooler parts of it. PB is an OH SHIT too though. It now matches brotherhood and riddle
[2:52:59] <Psych_man13_13> All right, Square it is
[2:53:02] <%Kinoskae> just be prepared to be the butt of the "jump off a cliff" joke
[2:53:02] <ZeterZero > Gotta dope up so you don't choke up.
[2:53:02] <ManfredA> legit just play SAM instead of MNK
[2:53:07] <%LaughingCatt> @ManfredA i remember that time, when Tornado Kick was actually cool & useful. That was a fun time doodSad
[2:53:09] <+SlashHabit> 2020 is the best year, wow.
[2:53:09] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Perfect balance is to just get your stacks back after a drop/burst
[2:53:14] <%walternatorz> @PatStaresAt when is Paige going to join the nerdom of FFXIV?
[2:53:16] <+DevinMayCry> PB will have CD increased again though
[2:53:18] <+alphonseisbest> @patstaresat any advice for someone who wants to play content as a tank first?
[2:53:19] <+DevinMayCry> And then reduced
[2:53:24] <+SlashHabit> but, 2020 is not as bad as 1939
[2:53:29] <+SlashHabit> we're spoiled
[2:53:30] <LorcaNomad> just woke up, what's pat doing right now?
[2:53:31] <SomersaultJustice> yeha, the monk
[2:53:35] <metalsiren31> God SAM is so good Kreygasm
[2:53:37] <%GarbageNirvana> SAM is fun MNK can confirm
[2:53:37] <%AncelDeLambert> PALADIN BIG PALADIN
[2:53:39] <ManfredA> SAM is also MUCH EASIER than MNK
[2:53:40] <2DSuperiority> Monk, the Free to Play Samurai
[2:53:41] <%Valdorick> See, and this is why the next DPS should NOT be melee, because melee peaked at ideas AT FOUR
[2:53:42] <@spacecapncrone> Tanking is real easy now
[2:53:42] <KoyaMusa> use a cooldown
[2:53:42] <lucky_icarus> turn your tank stance on
[2:53:43] <kumasbear> explain that you're new
[2:53:43] <DetroitSentai> just do it
[2:53:44] <%FroggoPrince> Rotate your defensive cooldowns - don't stack 'em
[2:53:48] <%AncelDeLambert> But yeah, flank the enemy
[2:53:49] <+DevinMayCry> Samurais don't have to work hard with poisitionals or stacks though
[2:53:50] <%NopeBadguy> No, you use Anatman to build stacks fast, then use PB to go DK, BS, DK, BS... under all the raid buffs. Be aware that PB will leave you stanceless when it wears off tho.
[2:53:50] <DetroitSentai> Use cooldowns
[2:53:52] <+Neoripo> And do not overpull
[2:53:54] <+pandamancer224> sorta
[2:53:55] <+alphonseisbest> that easy huh
[2:53:56] <%mikessdd> I PUNCH with SWORD
[2:53:56] <Orange_Kake> yes
[2:53:57] <metalsiren31> Tanking is the easiest way to run stuff blind, you have no mechanics
[2:53:57] <@spacecapncrone> remember that if you level sync, it takes tank stance off.
[2:53:57] <+CaptainJax> Use Arm's Length for big pulls
[2:54:00] <Blackjack760> turn tank stance ob
[2:54:02] <%LaughingCatt> not that I remember, no tanking guide from you
[2:54:02] <+doodoo_tummy> that slow puller isnt new though
[2:54:03] <DetroitSentai> A lot of tanks forget to use cooldowns on pulls
[2:54:04] <+alphonseisbest> not that i remember
[2:54:07] <%penitentpentwitch> Cycle your Cooldowns!!!
[2:54:10] <%AncelDeLambert> turn on rampart and fight or flight immediately
[2:54:10] <+fetrigon> is Twitch messing up for anyone else?
[2:54:11] <vVAstrAVv> have good gear and use cooldowns and watch boss casts
[2:54:11] <KoyaMusa> you can mitigate auto attacks, its good
[2:54:15] <%Kinoskae> Do big damage, hold more enmity
[2:54:15] <%JumboCrunchies> Don't spin the mobs, and don't try to kite when things get bad. It doesn't work.
[2:54:18] <%SaiyanShoto> I just started and started with monk and I already wanna drop it for a gunner dps LUL LUL
[2:54:18] <+smevvster> Tanking is nowhere near as scary as people who whine about "tank anxiety" make it sound like it is.
[2:54:22] <StaticSunrise> stand still unless you're dodging an ape, don't run around for no rrasont
[2:54:23] <+AlexanderEspen> Also Arms length is an actual cooldown
[2:54:26] <%SaiyanShoto> *funner
[2:54:27] <ManfredA> also use your invuln if you need it
[2:54:28] <+brandonsbetow> fun fact warrior is really fun, says tank main
[2:54:32] <%NopeBadguy> No, you use Anatman to build stacks fast, then use PB to go DK, BS, DK, BS... under all the raid buffs. Be aware that PB will leave you stanceless when it wears off tho. It's weird and clunky, so that'll prob get changed. @PatStaresAt
[2:54:32] <digitalbooklet> Remember to turn your tank stance on, use defensive cooldowns 1 at a time, dont pull big until you get used to position and pulling
[2:54:38] <+brandonsbetow> says warr main
[2:54:40] <DetroitSentai> Tankbuster on dungeons is the only thing you need CDs for on a boss
[2:54:40] <%a_goth_pancake> look up a rotation guide and burn it into your muscle memory
[2:54:45] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yeah but samurai doesn’t fill the void of punching gods in the face
[2:54:46] <floatRand> Remember, in dungeons mobs are vastly more dangerous than bosses
[2:54:51] <floatRand> So save your cooldowns for big pulls
[2:54:53] <%afronooch> grab mob, point away, stop moving
[2:54:55] <floatRand> And rotate accordingly
[2:55:00] <+dropthebehelit> gotten my tank to lvl 50 but now getting into content w/ multiple tanks. are we supposed to tank in tandem or take turns
[2:55:00] <+SH1NK1R0> Reprisal and arms length ar defense cds use them!
[2:55:05] <+CaptainJax> Are there any aoe positionals?
[2:55:05] <bashful_bard> If you're learning content, cooldown every cast that sounds like a tank buster
[2:55:06] <%AncelDeLambert> what equipment does Ninja use?
[2:55:06] <%NopeBadguy> Samurai also doesn't have a 90s raid buff tbh
[2:55:10] <+DevinMayCry> Yeah people try to avoid damage by moving out of the mobs way of attack. Most their standard attacks hit you regardless if you are literally in front of them or not.
[2:55:11] <%AncelDeLambert> can Ninja do big punch?
[2:55:11] <SpookyBeef7> Don't be the tank that runs around all over the place and makes it difficult for the DPS to place their AoEs or hit their positionals.
[2:55:19] <ZeterZero > Anything can be a punch if you try hard enough.
[2:55:24] <GarbageNirvana> @dropthebehelit Depends on what you're doing really
[2:55:25] <+AlexanderEspen> One of you Is the tank tanking the boss th eother is the tank tanking any adds
[2:55:28] <Klefth> Perfect Balance is ok
[2:55:30] <%kujofire990> Or be one of mothman's tanks and troll him by spinning the boss because lol dragoon
[2:55:30] <saraizarai> There's a reason monk is getting the ninja treatment. It's shit
[2:55:35] <Blackjack760> Warriors punch Kappa
[2:55:37] <%JumboCrunchies> @AncelDeLambert Ninja use dual daggers. And scouting gear, if thats what you mean.
[2:55:39] <digitalbooklet> @dropthebehelit it depends on the fight, some require tank switching and most just require 1 tank for some mobs and 1 tank for others
[2:55:39] <+Wallabri> ninja just do big stab
[2:55:41] <+smevvster> Pat's view of MNK is so tainted that even the fun PB phase of big dick DPS looks like it "sucks"
[2:55:41] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Like, do you want me to drop the Monk doc on the Discord?
[2:55:45] <@spacecapncrone> Ninja got one of the biggest hits in the game in SHB though
[2:55:51] <DFireCreations> why are 2 people bloodborneman
[2:55:53] <StaticSunrise> Monk becomes bad as soon as you stop being pugilist
[2:55:57] <%a_goth_pancake> learn how to do the hook/shotty/punch, it'll carry you well into grandmaster
[2:55:57] <DianaTheAscian> its a shame monk is bad cause punching is cool
[2:56:01] <StaticSunrise> widargelt is garbage
[2:56:02] <Blackjack760> hyosho ranryu
[2:56:02] <%GarbageNirvana> 24-mans you ain't gotta worry about, 8-man stuff there's usually a main tank and an off tank
[2:56:03] <%Kinoskae> @kujofire990 As a DRG main, may I say...rude.
[2:56:05] <+DevinMayCry> I feel like im at a roast of my day job. This is weird.
[2:56:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> I thought all Ninja could do was play fortnite and tell people that they have a shitty attitude if they approach it like it'sjust a game.
[2:56:16] <ZeterZero > Those are just Ghostbusters ghosts.
[2:56:23] <%kujofire990> @Kinoskae i just do it to moth lol
[2:56:28] <digitalbooklet> I dont find MNK bad but i've only been playing since ShB came out so I know nothing but this MNK
[2:56:31] <ZeterZero > Fair
[2:56:37] <+brandonsbetow> dragoon has the perfect amount of positionals for me
[2:56:39] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Monks: There are dozens of us! Dozens!
[2:56:39] <Klefth> They're dragon quest mobs
[2:56:39] <+Neoripo> Shadowbringer gear is Warrior of Darkness themed
[2:56:43] <+ImmaterialHero> there's like 2 good AST weapons in the game and they're both relics
[2:56:43] <@spacecapncrone> don't fall off the edge
[2:56:44] <SpookyBeef7> That feel when you tank a dungeon and try to mark down mobs that should be focused fired first but no one follows through. t101Oof
[2:56:45] <floatRand> Monk is "do combo" of dps, and black mage/samurai are "big number" of dps.
[2:56:46] <2DSuperiority> aw yeah tight rope time
[2:56:46] <%kujofire990> oh shit it's that boy
[2:56:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> DRG only deserves about half of the shit it gets.
[2:56:51] <%JumboCrunchies> AST is my favorite healer to play. Its a shame so few of their weapons actually look cool.
[2:56:54] <%Wallabri> leg man is here
[2:56:56] <+doodoo_tummy> pat's gonna get imped
[2:56:58] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Urianger just gapcloses over the gap on this boss and it fucked me up for the longest time
[2:56:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> Every group needs a good floor tank
[2:57:01] <Lt_Campbell> LongFrog
[2:57:06] <Shougasan> pepe frog
[2:57:12] <%FroggoPrince> my son
[2:57:13] <SpookyBeef7> Holy shit, I thought I was the only one that did ready checks?!
[2:57:15] <+BloodyBurney> if you really want to dump poetics (and waste your life) the Anima AST wep is very pretty
[2:57:17] <+smevvster> Bruh moans about MNK all day while loving DRK, the job SE dicked for SB, then "fixed" by just turning it into WAR with a dot LUL
[2:57:20] <+LittleBigQuebec> Trusts cheat here
[2:57:21] <DetroitSentai> This tank respects the dungeon
[2:57:25] <digitalbooklet> pat how good are you at this circus act of a boss mechanic
[2:57:30] <%NopeBadguy> I do ready checks AND the full 15 second countdown :)
[2:57:33] <%MisterTylerrr> Lookout for forgsong
[2:57:34] <+NekoDraga> Long long froooooooog!
[2:57:39] <%JumboCrunchies> Ill gift a sub if Pat become Frog.
[2:57:41] <+doodoo_tummy> CALLED IT
[2:57:42] <%BIumen> thaaaat's monk
[2:57:48] <%kenstank> I like to level everything up at the same time and grind every dungeon for every piece of gear because mind goblins, Dohn Mheg was actually my favorite one to do
[2:57:49] <%LaughingCatt> lobosKek
[2:57:51] <%MisterTylerrr> Should switch to wind fist for faster dps
[2:57:53] <%QuietteShy> 335 raiders from QuietteShy have joined! 
[2:57:53] <DetroitSentai> monk
[2:57:54] <MayorRev> SHY RAID
[2:57:56] <%penitentpentwitch> Stacks falll! Stacks Fall! STACKS FALL!
[2:57:57] <KoyaMusa> do use form shift more often
[2:58:03] <floatRand> This is fun with trust party.
[2:58:04] <Blackjack760> it's a raid Kappa
[2:58:05] <%afronooch> i'll gift a sub if Pat makes it across the pathon first try
[2:58:05] <+zepelinnn1> WE FAAAAALL
[2:58:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> I hate this boss
[2:58:05] <filialpails> you know what they say about lords with lengthsome gaits
[2:58:06] <aeonicvector> pfffft
[2:58:07] <digitalbooklet> go pat go
[2:58:07] <%SpcOpsBear> WARNING. INCOMING GAME.
[2:58:11] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat What is the different subroles that tanks have based on there classes?
[2:58:11] <Saltmeisterr> oh shit its the shy of quietness
[2:58:12] <@spacecapncrone> what a baller
[2:58:12] <$shadow1man9> Could just mash Form Shift to keep it
[2:58:12] <MayorRev> big shy raid
[2:58:13] <%mike2hands> SHYY RAAID
[2:58:15] <@spacecapncrone> sprinting the whole way
[2:58:17] <%afronooch> fuk
[2:58:20] <%NopeBadguy> I think ideally one of those should be a Demolish refresh to keep your stacks up IIRC @PatStaresAt
[2:58:22] <%miabyte> psaDogchamp psaBig SHY RAID
[2:58:23] <%vaporousTippler> We fall guys.
[2:58:24] <+brandonsbetow> F for tank
[2:58:29] <+Neoripo> Clumsy Tank
[2:58:34] <%afronooch> afronooch is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 3 in the channel! 
[2:58:35] <%afronooch> afronooch gifted a Tier 1 sub to tanarath! 
[2:58:36] <%afronooch> afronooch's Gift shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[2:58:38] <+DevinMayCry> You do DK->Punch twice each is all and a demolish as needed or whatever
[2:58:41] <%Joustar_> wow thanks twitch for not warning me at ALL
[2:58:43] <+smevvster> @PhantomMiG There are no tank "sub roles", the role is so homogenized they all basically do the same thing, with *minor* differences
[2:58:47] <Klefth> Oh hey Cassie
[2:58:49] <ManfredA> Cucuhulainn
[2:58:52] <%MisterTylerrr> Look, it's Hentai
[2:58:52] <floatRand> That shittyvoid arc boss
[2:58:55] <MayorRev> shy gang shy gang
[2:59:01] <digitalbooklet> cant you just form shift to keep greased lightning stacks? or use your finisher if you know its gonna go
[2:59:03] <+zepelinnn1> i was gonna say
[2:59:06] <+alphonseisbest> LOOK ITS THE FLOOD
[2:59:06] <%Valdorick> Speen to Ween
[2:59:07] <ZeterZero > That's not a strangely hansom frog man!
[2:59:08] <+hananafell> the boss go SPEEEN
[2:59:09] <%QuietteShy> quiettSuperdab dkdiaDab f70sDab psaDab bo8Dab
[2:59:12] <noredeemingvalue> that bitch got Seath legs
[2:59:16] <Saltmeisterr> THE FAT EVIL
[2:59:22] <+smevvster> When's the last time Pat pushed True North?
[2:59:30] <cascadepersona> It's hard playing Mouse and keyboard and remembering to look at the screen and not my Hotbar, lol.
[2:59:31] <%kenstank> so a certain Trust character has special dialogue during this boss and the tightrope part lol
[2:59:32] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt One of your GCDs in PB should be a Demolish refresh to prevent that
[2:59:33] <watts121> Did pat Stream 5.3 MSQ?
[2:59:34] <ManfredA> don't you love spinning bosses on MNK
[2:59:38] <+CaptainJax> What's a True North?
[2:59:45] <aeonicvector> But this isnt warframe
[2:59:47] <%miabyte> Pat is very focused
[2:59:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> @watts121 Yes
[2:59:52] <aeonicvector> HahaThink
[2:59:54] <+DevinMayCry> True North makes positionals universal
[2:59:55] <stoic_nod> Oh no! Jiggly tentacle boss!
[2:59:56] <%miabyte> Shy raid and stuff
[2:59:58] <watts121> Where can I find it?
[2:59:59] <digitalbooklet> that aint the tank spinnin thats the boss ignoring aggro at this phase because long boi give no damns
[3:00:00] <+DevinMayCry> So does Riddle of Earth when hit
[3:00:07] <+mmack093> If I were to start playing this how many hours would it take to get my first character to cap?
[3:00:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> I don't think True North is actually useful?
[3:00:12] <stoic_nod> miasHug @miabyte
[3:00:13] <MayorRev> more like final CANTasy
[3:00:13] <+brandonsbetow> Honestly, as a warr main, I would adjust if we had positional heavy dps
[3:00:19] <%JumboCrunchies> Aenc Thon, Lord of the Big Steppie
[3:00:20] <watts121> I wanna see if he ironically had sympathy for <spoilers> when he hated <spoilers> so much
[3:00:21] <+DevinMayCry> Its EXTREMELY useful for Monks
[3:00:22] <ManfredA> true north is super useful what
[3:00:33] <+DevinMayCry> Its HUGE for Monks and basically exists for us alone
[3:00:34] <aeonicvector> @mmack093 a fair bit, but no need for alternates, one character can be all jobs
[3:00:36] <KnightAsteran> @rumtumtugnutz its essentially in EXs and savage
[3:00:42] <ManfredA> it's useful for SAM too so I can turn off my two remaining braincells
[3:00:43] <digitalbooklet> true north on MNK is basically how you get past all your positionals during some phases
[3:00:47] <+alphonseisbest> @Patstaresat u gonna play any content as DRK tonight? id like to see how it looks when played well
[3:00:50] <2DSuperiority> become as froog
[3:01:09] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt One of your GCDs in PB should be a Demolish refresh to prevent stack loss
[3:01:12] <DianaTheAscian> wow
[3:01:12] <+DevinMayCry> You never ever want to be not attacking and not be in wrong positional so it helps a lot with avoiding AOEs
[3:01:13] <+WinstonThrasher> i wish positionals would just go away
[3:01:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> @KnightAsteran I've done plenty of extremes and savages and never popped it. But it might be cause I'm bad at games
[3:01:13] <+BloodyBurney> I once had a party that had such low dps that we saw 2 rounds of tankbusters/aoe bleeds
[3:01:15] <Daxalog> Whats even the point of dps limit break?
[3:01:17] <DetroitSentai> No
[3:01:23] <%afronooch> @mmack093 i started at the end of may, and hit max like 2 weeks ago
[3:01:23] <ManfredA> there's a reason I skip Mheg and Switch
[3:01:34] <%JumboCrunchies> PET AND SONG
[3:01:36] <+smevvster> @Daxalog To deal damage?
[3:01:43] <aeonicvector> @Daxalog LOTS of damage, either in An AoE, or single target if its a melee
[3:01:44] <%SomeSageAdvice> housing outside furniture
[3:01:50] <Finaldragoon> housing item
[3:01:51] <@spacecapncrone> damn, the furniture dropped!?
[3:01:52] <$JamJamX3> @PatStaresAt Did you ever have problems regarding inventory when it came to managing crafting/gathering and your battle gear?
[3:01:54] <+doodoo_tummy> the slow puller?
[3:01:56] <GrenYena> @patstaresat heyo Pat, just got into ff14 a couple months ago and am starting savage stuff next week, just wanted to ask what your opinions on ACT and parsing are, because i play on console it feels like i have no real way of seeing if my gameplay is improving outside of just guessing, I really wanna be able to see numbers but cant
[3:01:56] <KoyaMusa> it should be an upgrade since one is probably an i390 ring
[3:02:01] <aeonicvector> Honestly healer and tank LB are the ones that are either useless or amazing
[3:02:11] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt does skill speed do affect anything?
[3:02:14] <%kenstank> remember when you didn't have to roll for the furniture lol
[3:02:20] <+alphonseisbest> yeyeyeyeyeye
[3:02:23] <digitalbooklet> @daxalog caster one is good for mobs at some points, ranged one is for certain fights & physical dps one does the most dmg of the 3, single target and is best used for under 50 content
[3:02:29] <%SpcOpsBear> Skill Speed affects weaponskill recast rate and DoT damage
[3:02:30] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[3:02:33] <%NopeBadguy> @GrenYena It's fine as long as you aren't being a dick about it, but IDK if there's a way to check on PS4.
[3:02:36] <watts121> I use Skill Speed on my DRK for that extra Bloodletter
[3:02:38] <+gumballwizard> oh oh
[3:02:39] <%Typhaeon> Oh shit
[3:02:40] <%thegreatbambe> No it has to be everywhere
[3:02:41] <@spacecapncrone> The GNB LB3 is called "Gunmetal Soul" and it's fuckin' sick
[3:02:42] <+mmack093> LOL

[3:03:18] <+UberWolfman> NFO FUN PAT
[3:03:20] <AdjustKiefer> Pat you making the Free trial look super temping on PS4 with you using a Controller so effortlessly
[3:03:23] <%Valdorick> No wonder Pat is so small, so he can fit into his Genie lamp
[3:03:27] <VizualBlitz> @Aydarkzero pretty sure the 350 would offset that LUL
[3:03:30] <DetroitSentai> there's only one exclusive item for each moogle tome even

[3:03:57] <Aydarkzero> Paige is afraid of the atk boos LUL
[3:03:58] <@spacecapncrone> Play a lalafel and still be bigger than Pat's Roe in all the art.
[3:04:00] <+LittleBigQuebec> Paige, the reason he isn't a lalafel is because he's tired of people looking down to talk to him LUL
[3:04:01] <digitalbooklet> YEAAAAH PAIGE BE A POTATO
[3:04:02] <%lucidrush> Lala Pat is still too tall
[3:04:02] <@SoFarFetched> PAIGE THAT MAN IS GONNA PAY FOR YOUR WENDY'S ORDER

[3:04:06] <ZeterZero > But....will you by a cool tiger man?
[3:04:06] <cascadepersona> Paige Plays FFXIV would be quite the years long series
[3:04:07] <shurtal> Does Pat hat the potato people because he is one i real life? Does he hate his own people?

[3:06:29] <+brandonsbetow> wait, fractal was stormblood, couldve sworn it was heavens
[3:06:34] <KenzBurp> i gotta do this one stil urghgh

[3:07:18] <%Typhaeon> I was gonna say someone should have a fuckin stun
[3:07:19] <ManfredA> DRK was the king of dungeons in SB
[3:07:20] <ricotez> you're just missing 5% of your DPS because you don't have Living Shadow
[3:07:20] <+DevinMayCry> Pat has yells macroed for his moves to you just cant see them
[3:07:22] <Blackjack760> Don't use Living Dead
[3:07:25] <Aydarkzero> these bosses look cool
[3:07:26] <bashful_bard> You don't want to blow them all at once tho
[3:07:28] <namisrot> hello pat and pat chat we are watching the re7 vods rn but wanted to say hi
[3:07:30] <DetroitSentai> it doesnt kill you
[3:07:31] <+smevvster> I love how Living Dead is such a shit invuln, the new trial *inflicts* it on you as a mechanic.
[3:07:35] <DianaTheAscian> but living dead is the best move Pat
[3:07:38] <%NopeBadguy> I mean don't FRONTLOAD your tank CDs
[3:07:39] <%VioletHeart> Living dead all the time.

[3:08:55] <aqua_mashu> blue dps carry
[3:09:01] <+DevinMayCry> Bits are just funnels huh
[3:09:02] <ricotez> the dungeon is insulting their dps by lowering it even further
[3:09:03] <+burgerdicks> wow King Whomp really stepped up his game
[3:09:05] <Aydarkzero> what secrets does it hold?
[3:09:09] <watts121> I wish I wasn't lazy cuz GNB has the best animations, but playing that class is exhausting to me
[3:09:11] <floatRand> Still, Fractal Continuum is so cool dungeon
[3:09:15] <+SH1NK1R0> Is pat on primal?
[3:09:22] <@spacecapncrone> yeah
[3:09:23] <floatRand> Hard is kinda sad how the ixali kinda finds out about their origins.
[3:09:25] <BinaryShuffle> Not even USB C, only one direction smh
[3:09:26] <ManfredA> Pat's an Ultros boy
[3:09:32] <%penitentpentwitch> I wonder if Paige would go FemRoe in FF14?
[3:09:34] <+dropthebehelit> why don't you all remember the mechanics of a dungeon you've probably only ran once months ago?!?
[3:09:36] <floatRand> Ixal? Ixali? Whatever
[3:09:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Think they'll ever do a FF7R event once that game is all finished?
[3:09:53] <KnightAsteran> Ixali is the plural
[3:09:54] <$Thatghostpepper> #5- for gunbreaker users.. tell healers AHEAD of time that you're using superboilde
[3:09:56] <+DevinMayCry> Thats what happens when you worship a false god. Gaius warned em
[3:10:04] <+SH1NK1R0> @watts121 it can be. It’s why I can’t play late at night lol. It’s my main and if I’m sleepy I screw up
[3:10:21] <$Thatghostpepper> it'll save them the heart attack
[3:10:24] <+pandamancer224> wanna see an infinitie?
[3:10:38] <+smevvster> @Thatghostpepper I ain't typing out that I'm using an invuln mid pull are you high
[3:10:39] <%Typhaeon> Oh yeah this is the dungeon where the entire point of the story is made pointless by "shut up though" after the end
[3:10:48] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt would u ever do a one off or playthrough of hyper light drifter pat?
[3:10:57] <KoyaMusa> nostalgically recall finishing the burn in 10 minutes with good groups
[3:11:06] <VidulaSaix> This dungeon became retroactively way more important in 5.3
[3:11:06] <gentlemanboxer> Shut up though
[3:11:09] <$Thatghostpepper> @smevvster macros my good sir/madam
[3:11:21] <@spacecapncrone> flying through a dungeon with high dps feels *really* good
[3:11:24] <VidulaSaix> Look at the next boss
[3:11:25] <watts121> @SH1NK1R0 yeah I was gonna main it in Shadowbringers, but went back to DRK cuz playing DRK is so much lazier.
[3:11:33] <@spacecapncrone> yeah
[3:11:34] <+smevvster> @Thatghostpepper I have a macro that says I used it *when* I use it, not before.
[3:11:35] <floatRand> G WARRIOOR
[3:11:37] <KnightAsteran> G UNIT
[3:11:40] <+DevinMayCry> OHHHHHHHHHHHH

[3:11:50] <watts121> @SH1NK1R0 I still do quests with it tho.
[3:11:51] <%Rumbutt> Oh shit
[3:11:52] <+DevinMayCry> THATS WHERE THE KING GAINER DREADS CAME FROM
[3:11:54] <floatRand> And good riddance! Because his model is so fucking cool
[3:11:54] <%Wallabri> OHHHHHHHHH
[3:11:56] <+dropthebehelit> yooo
[3:11:57] <SpookyBeef7> Huh, well what do you know.
[3:11:57] <%Typhaeon> The Ultima Warrior is also a really strong boss name
[3:11:57] <%Wallabri> i FORGOT
[3:11:58] <%MisterRockett> Okay okay I'm going through it now.
[3:11:59] <+Neoripo> It's the BOI!
[3:12:06] <Klefth> I didn't even remember this stuff
[3:12:06] <DarkCloud79> G warrior
[3:12:08] <2DSuperiority> so a lala is piloting that?
[3:12:08] <+ConLin_Arts_> psaDogchamp
[3:12:08] <Zebroneath> @PatStaresAt or anyone else: What's the best Gatherer/Crafting class to start with?
[3:12:14] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> I was wondering where this thing showed up
[3:12:19] <bashful_bard> I think I did this dungeon one time and totally forgot
[3:12:21] <MoonKing> Cid finessed this shit
[3:12:25] <+crazyspartan214> Sapphire Weapon!?!?!?
[3:12:26] <+DevinMayCry> Literally do all of them. Start with any
[3:12:31] <+DevinMayCry> Fishing is weirdest
[3:12:31] <+UberWolfman> I WANT A G WARRIOR MODEL KIT SO BAD
[3:12:31] <+alphonseisbest> WAIT IS THIS THE MECH?
[3:12:32] <%JumboCrunchies> I dont think I ever did this dungeon. Somehow.
[3:12:34] <@SoFarFetched> Just check out Pat's video on FFXIV
[3:12:35] <+smevvster> This is straight up where Cid says he got the design for the G Warrior from - makes a bit less sense if you don't do it, since I'm like 90% sure it's optional
[3:12:40] <%snugglepuggs> can someone explain why?
[3:12:40] <+Neoripo> Even that attack
[3:12:43] <Floofiie> @Zebroneath All of em, but probably blacksmith to craft all your other tools
[3:12:43] <Aydarkzero> Ultima Warrior?
[3:12:48] <+garekerag> I kinda like how warring triad is where most of the current markers come from
[3:12:48] <+SH1NK1R0> Yeah cid was like hmmm. That first boss seems useful
[3:12:48] <+Basilias_Maximus> He did mention finding it in Azys Lah
[3:12:51] <@spacecapncrone> They evened out all the crafting classes so there's none that are vital to get up first anymore
[3:12:54] <watts121> I thought 5.3 rebalanced the crafter/gatherers so that it didn't matter that much between them.
[3:12:54] <+Neoripo> And the mine, holy shit
[3:12:54] <VidulaSaix> Totally not abilities G Warrior will get in the future Kappa
[3:12:59] <%rdark_ksu> rdark_ksu subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Hey Pat currenlty back in my tiny lil home town after getting laid off in the city where I live and its been a fuckin trip. Pet the babies.
[3:13:03] <$Trenr> @Zebroneath mining and botany are both good gathering classes, either is fine
[3:13:03] <KenzBurp> @Zebroneath I prefer botany, but you can level fishing up super fast now
[3:13:03] <KnightAsteran> Good old G Unit
[3:13:12] <%Typhaeon> Cool buff, still dead
[3:13:19] <%penitentpentwitch> Mining/Botanist with Weaver/Leatherworker lets you craft most of your crafter armor
[3:13:20] <Aydarkzero> ded
[3:13:23] <Explodincatz> u take no dmg at all
[3:13:26] <+garekerag> wasting good poetics, SMDH
[3:13:28] <thememeticwind> G-Warrior*
[3:13:32] <+DevinMayCry> the forbidden word of G
[3:13:33] <floatRand> It is such cool thing and I was so disappointed it wasn't used elsewhere at the time
[3:13:40] <floatRand> But having it now is such a great thing
[3:13:50] <floatRand> Also, the next fucking boss.
[3:13:54] <%nimu290> whats this dun?
[3:13:54] <Zebroneath> Thanks for the responses. I'll look into those. :)
[3:14:06] <watts121> Did they even hint at what Weapon is gonna be after Sapphire Weapon?
[3:14:10] <watts121> Emerald or Diamond?
[3:14:11] <Aydarkzero> it broke free monkaS
[3:14:11] <%SaiyanShoto> I remember back in the day when everyone would say G-Unit a lot
[3:14:15] <@spacecapncrone> probably Emerald
[3:14:16] <ZeterZero > You ever imagine what the monsters are saying to each other when the party just comes rolling in?
[3:14:19] <VidulaSaix> Most likely Emerald
[3:14:24] <KnightAsteran> @watts121 most likely emerald, then diamond
[3:14:24] <Floofiie> Wasn't that 50- Cent
[3:14:26] <ManfredA> Emerald would follow 7
[3:14:28] <Blackjack760> probably emerald
[3:14:40] <+alphonseisbest> What questline unlocks this?
[3:14:51] <%NopeBadguy> BIOHAZARD...FOURTEEN...
[3:14:54] <T_Sasquatch> Im currently playing the free trial , level 31 monk and I don't understand how the fuck people paid for subs to get through the base game
[3:14:56] <+SH1NK1R0> Yeah I think emerald is next
[3:14:57] <Aydarkzero> how many Weapon fights are in this so far?
[3:15:00] <+DevinMayCry> Kuja someday
[3:15:05] <ZeterZero > "They killed Greg! Why would anyone want to kill Greg!?!?
[3:15:05] <@spacecapncrone> Brobinyak fucking LOVES poison
[3:15:07] <watts121> 2 so far
[3:15:18] <ZeterZero > Says the chimera to his mates.
[3:15:20] <KoyaMusa> azys lla is such a cool area i WISH it had stuff to do in it
[3:15:22] <Aydarkzero> Ultima & Ruby right?
[3:15:25] <watts121> and they went full Gundam with the storyline
[3:15:27] <+SH1NK1R0> So far we have sapphire ruby and several ultimas
[3:15:34] <KnightAsteran> @aydarkzero 2, or 4 if you count ultima and omega
[3:15:35] <+DevinMayCry> We will go back there sometime pretty sure
[3:15:40] <Aydarkzero> ah
[3:15:40] <KnightAsteran> oh and proto ultima
[3:15:44] <%Typhaeon> Who knew that combining a Brobin and a Yak would yield suck horrors
[3:15:44] <+garekerag> Yeah FFXIV really has a nasty tendency of wasting its final zones
[3:15:48] <Aydarkzero> thats pretty cool
[3:15:50] <ManfredA> omega isn't a weapon
[3:15:51] <T_Sasquatch> Every single forum ive seen people are like it gets good in Heavensward. That's 185 fucking quests and a new expansion, NotLikeThis
[3:15:52] <%Typhaeon> also what's a brobin
[3:15:54] <ManfredA> he's Omega from 5
[3:16:01] <KnightAsteran> for the gem weapons we've done Ruby and Sapphire
[3:16:13] <@spacecapncrone> they did a good job with ShB's final area and just leaned into not worrying about filling it with enemies.
[3:16:16] <watts121> @T_Sasquatch yeah but Heavensward is like...REALLY good
[3:16:20] <ManfredA> Omega Weapon is probably what the Garleans are working on
[3:16:20] <Floofiie> Base is good, but it's an origin story like any other story
[3:16:21] <ZeterZero > No Garnet weapon yet.
[3:16:22] <floatRand> But now HW is free
[3:16:24] <%crowsloft77> @t_sasquatch luckily for you they trimmed arr heavily
[3:16:32] <drastic_go_down> best boss theme Kreygasm
[3:16:37] <+garekerag> T_Sasquatch: nah it's fun before then, Heavensward is just when the story gets really good
[3:16:41] <+LittleBigQuebec> FF6 Atma weapon
[3:16:43] <floatRand> Don't call it Atma
[3:16:46] <T_Sasquatch> @watts121 it better be fucking worth it or I'm never playing mmos again
[3:16:48] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> oh no im missing a 14 stream
[3:16:50] <+garekerag> Once you do Titan and Garuda you'll get it
[3:16:50] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Atmaaaaaa~
[3:17:02] <%GarbageNirvana> yo that just a behemoth with a backpack
[3:17:05] <T_Sasquatch> @crowsloft77 bawkHm lacHm bawkWeird
[3:17:11] <dinnydanny777> What's on his back
[3:17:17] <+LittleBigQuebec> SPEEN
[3:17:19] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> also for that one guy, heavensward is a peak, stormblood is a plateau, post stormblood content is a HUGE peak, then shb is another peak
[3:17:20] <ZeterZero > That's just a behemoth!
[3:17:21] <watts121> Omega Weapon is a different thing in Stormblood, it has it's own storyline
[3:17:28] <KnightAsteran> shitty allagan tech dinny
[3:17:31] <+garekerag> @T_Sasquatch maybe try a different class? You might just hate PUG/MNK
[3:17:36] <drastic_go_down> think they did that with the arbotoreum hard mode too
[3:17:44] <T_Sasquatch> I saw someone riding a behemoth mount and panicked because of monster hunter LUL
[3:17:57] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> MNK is a high skill ceiling class for mediocre output imo
[3:18:00] <+brandonsbetow> The location is in HW though
[3:18:06] <+smevvster> @T_Sasquatch How bad ARR is way over exaggerated - at least as far as tab-target MMOs go. Prior to HW it's just kinda generic, whereas HW it really starts to carve out it's own identity, which is why people so fondly remember that in particular.
[3:18:08] <%angel949> @t_sasquatch I just did the same lol
[3:18:13] <Floofiie> Do you call certain mechanics Meteors? or Towers?
[3:18:20] <T_Sasquatch> @garekerag nah I love monk if i wasn't I would've stopped a dozen levels ago
[3:18:20] <ManfredA> they originally referred to Omega as Omega Weapon but I think that was a TL thing
[3:18:21] <KoyaMusa> no sir not moving from these ley lines
[3:18:24] <$Thatghostpepper> @T_Sasquatch ah ptsd mh
[3:18:26] <ZeterZero > Tubas are important with giant monster themes.
[3:18:33] <ManfredA> cuz he sure as shit isn't Omega weapon
[3:18:39] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> everything you have to hide behind to avoid a raidwide aoe is just a meteor to me
[3:18:58] <+garekerag> @T_Sasquatch then just stick with it, once you do Titan and especially Garuda you'll start getting the hype
[3:18:59] <watts121> The problem with ARR IMO is that the story doesn't get really good until like level 40, then it's like holy shit this is kinda hype. Then you get to the end of the main ARR story and you enter this weird Naruto Filler Arc until pre-Heavensward
[3:18:59] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @smevvster Half way through Post ARR jumps from generic crap to OH FUCK
[3:19:00] <KnightAsteran> Omega was called Omega Weapon back when we thought he was an allag creation at the end of HW
[3:19:06] <gentlemanboxer> Ultimate beast more like ultimate bitch
[3:19:09] <%angel949> @t_sasquatch I was in the desert and suddenly A Behemoth crested over a dune, and i nearly shat myself
[3:19:09] <%Valdorick> Good job, new guy
[3:19:11] <ManfredA> yeah
[3:19:15] <%GarbageNirvana> Goddammit spend those poetics
[3:19:15] <floatRand> I feel Atma weapon was kinda wasted
[3:19:17] <+alphonseisbest> @platstaresat what ilevel are u, also GOOD JOB!
[3:19:20] <floatRand> Should have been in Sigmascape
[3:19:24] <Aydarkzero> didn't even say gg FeelsBadMan
[3:19:28] <%Valdorick> Fog?
[3:19:29] <ManfredA> they stopped calling him that which makes me think it was a mis tl or they reswerved
[3:19:32] <%gespenst25> isn't it just fog?
[3:19:33] <%JD_Lars> How much would I have to pay for Pat to play “Wipeout” on his belly drum while Paige sits there and complains?
[3:19:36] <T_Sasquatch> My biggest issue is just how boring quests can be. I just did a quest line that was like just 10 fetch quests in a row
[3:19:37] <drastic_go_down> rollin for the twinning
[3:19:51] <Blackjack760> c'mon twinning
[3:20:01] <+garekerag> So does Pat have an alt on Primal or am I missing something, swear I saw him do coils on a lala yest
[3:20:09] <Aydarkzero> that song is good LUL
[3:20:09] <%Arxel1> TWINNING Pog
[3:20:09] <%Valdorick> YEYEYE TWINNING
[3:20:10] <KnightAsteran> @manfreda I think its because Midgard told us he wasn't an allag weapon but a separate, intelligent entity
[3:20:11] <%nimu290> the twinning time?
[3:20:12] <+LittleBigQuebec> Amurot
[3:20:13] <+metal_gearxxx> qitanna

[3:20:13] <metalsiren31> Amaurot
[3:20:14] <%the22cstomp> grand cosmos
[3:20:15] <%angel949> Twinning.mp4
[3:20:15] <+smevvster> If you don't like MMOs, you won't like ARR. HW is just a good game all on it's own, though.
[3:20:16] <drastic_go_down> it was always the jazzy one for me
[3:20:16] <%Rumbutt> It'll end up as Cosmos
[3:20:16] <TioXyco> grand cosmos
[3:20:16] <%penitentpentwitch> Amaurot?
[3:20:19] <CyborgAV> it's gonna be grand cosmos
[3:20:19] <%weissguard> Twinning theme FUCKS
[3:20:20] <DetroitSentai> grand cosmos
[3:20:20] <+ImmaterialHero> probably Amaurot unfortunately or Cosmos
[3:20:21] <ManfredA> it'll be Akademia or Cosmos

[3:21:35] <+DevinMayCry> Yeah nothing big
[3:21:42] <+smevvster> @AncelDeLambert Au Ra are native to the Azim Steppe, so when you get there, you get some specific dialogue.
[3:21:44] <+smevvster> for example.
[3:21:47] <KnightAsteran> @anceldelambert 8f you're a cat person and you talk to the Feline in the MonHun que you can say "a talking cat?" and the feline just says look in a mirror
[3:21:59] <%KishinGrek> butt crack
[3:22:11] <+DevinMayCry> Start of ShB has a single line that changes depending on your race

[4:02:15] <KnightAsteran> too early
[4:02:16] <CruxAustralis> like
[4:02:17] <CruxAustralis> it's uncanny

[4:02:28] <nsDrummer> nah it was on time
[4:02:29] <+metal_gearxxx> lol that DRK was almost dead
[4:02:32] <floatRand> The timing is different on Ex?
[4:02:32] <%Valdorick> Ultimate Crossover LUL
[4:02:33] <nsDrummer> they would be dead LUL
[4:02:35] <%NopeBadguy> @CruxAustralis It's the same guy who sings Rules of Nature
[4:02:39] <Lt_Campbell> I love that attack is called ULTIMATE CROSSOVER
[4:02:42] <watts121> wish they had more mechanics that used the Tank LB like this
[4:02:43] <Otatoptohami> its the vocalist from (all of?) the MGR tracks
[4:02:45] <JowiJoestar> Yes it is!
[4:02:48] <JowiJoestar> jason c miller!
[4:02:50] <Rei_Dsoto> I wish I had the expansion now!
[4:03:00] <aeonicvector> Palom and Porom!!!
[4:03:02] <+Dorf1> why is warrior of light a giant?
[4:03:03] <%Cervarian> Cervarian subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Always love watching as my under-level-40 self and watching in blissful ignorance all the stuff I'll have to learn... stripSuffer
[4:03:03] <KoyaMusa> he hallowed grounds if you do an offensive lb against him if he has lb
[4:03:04] <LordOfThePoultry> so whats wol doing here?
[4:03:07] <%Puhff> god i love this song
[4:03:08] <Lt_Campbell> AngelThump
[4:03:10] <DetroitSentai> I wish more fights made use of ALL limit breaks, UwU does and it is great
[4:03:11] <%IncredibleMeh> wow I think this is the only MMO I've seen that has boss fights that are fun to watch
[4:03:16] <bashful_bard> The timing is different in ex yeah. His ult casts faster
[4:03:22] <%penitentpentwitch> Ice imbued
[4:03:32] <%the22cstomp> that blm doesnt care
[4:03:35] <Otatoptohami> ex fight is so much fun
[4:03:37] <%KuroStardust> Hey Pat, have you cleared the EX version of this fight yet?
[4:03:38] <nsDrummer> SourPls
[4:03:39] <DrillStopsNoCops> Just finished killing him with my FC
[4:03:39] <%SpaceCatStation> ooohhh that black mage NotLikeThis
[4:03:41] <transporterthesequel> @lordofthepoultry there is a small chance Elidibus is in fact the original Warrior of Light
[4:03:54] <aeonicvector> @IncredibleMeh go look up some of the other bosses as EX then, or "The Epic of Alexander"
[4:03:54] <watts121> @LordOfThePoultry you really gotta see the story in full to really understand why
[4:03:57] <DrillStopsNoCops> I MEAN just killing him in EX
[4:04:00] <BlueVexer> Yeah damage LB in this fight requires a teeny bit of thought.
[4:04:07] <nsDrummer> also fun fact chat, all his attacks are the same as player attacks
[4:04:08] <Floofiie> Quintuplecast ptsd
[4:04:17] <bashful_bard> He's not the original WoL, he's zodiark's heart
[4:04:21] <Thepothero> The fucker can hallowed ground too if DPS tries to LB him
[4:04:23] <%Alpha8087> I really like Quintuplecast
[4:04:35] <%Alpha8087> Better than freakin E2S Quietus
[4:04:36] <nsDrummer> LUL
[4:04:37] <Otatoptohami> oooof
[4:04:40] <Drigoooooo> Azem is the original WoL
[4:04:43] <%Birdigalore> lol Braver always wrecks the group
[4:04:44] <nsDrummer> rip the dps
[4:04:45] <+SH1NK1R0> @transporterthesequel um....no there isn’t. There literally zero chance since they tell us explicitly who the og warrior of light is in this patch
[4:04:45] <Aydarkzero> damn
[4:04:48] <DetroitSentai> Those should have earthshaker markers to be fair
[4:04:48] <%HiroTSK5> Shame he doesn't have Dissidia's Summon Swords
[4:04:50] <%penitentpentwitch> Really bad time for so few people
[4:04:51] <MoonKing> SOUL SURRENDED PogChamp
[4:04:55] <Otatoptohami> yeah voidwalker quietus can go die in a hole
[4:04:58] <+AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Of course it's Black Mages.
[4:05:00] <%Valdorick> RIP Blackmages, they died as they lived. On the floor.
[4:05:02] <Floofiie> No reprisal smh
[4:05:06] <%Shockrates20XX> Can you stack those line stacks together?
[4:05:07] <%weissguard> Had a feeling one of those Black Mages would die eventually. They were cruisin' for that bruisin'.
[4:05:11] <+metal_gearxxx> Elidibus was the first WoL of the First, it was shown in one of the 5.3 cutscenes
[4:05:18] <nsDrummer> LUL

[4:05:45] <%MrBorisMakarov> @spcopsbear atpRtsd
[4:05:49] <Bearheart223> @metal_gearxxx He just takes the form of the first WoL in this fight.
[4:05:49] <PrimordialDonut> no red mage FeelsBadMan
[4:05:50] <Thepothero> rooKek
[4:05:57] <Lt_Campbell> The Blackest Night is THE BEST
[4:05:58] <Rei_Dsoto> Grabbypaws~
[4:06:00] <gluemanofficial> BabyRage I'm the DPS! BabyRage Gotta love me!
[4:06:03] <watts121> hopefully a DPS doesn't waste that LB3
[4:06:08] <Lt_Campbell> its so satisfying to juust EAT tank busters
[4:06:19] <watts121> or is that only EX?
[4:06:25] <DetroitSentai> He isnt the first WoL HE INSPIRED THE WoL through history to make events happen
[4:06:32] <Bearheart223> @watts121 normal too
[4:06:33] <%LaughingCatt> this in EX lobosKek
[4:06:36] <Otatoptohami> i hope more bosses in the future have ways to block LBs, makes it a bit more tactical about when to use it
[4:06:38] <%Nupinoop296> imagine playing a caster DPS for this fight Kappa
[4:06:43] <bashful_bard> He uses hallowed in normal too
[4:06:46] <DetroitSentai> And he takes on the idealized version of a WoL and becomes basically a primal
[4:06:48] <nsDrummer> people knowing about arms length in normal LUL
[4:06:51] <Srthunda> those black mages
[4:06:51] <%Birdigalore> BLACK MAGES DOWN
[4:06:56] <%Valdorick> LITTLE BLACKMAGES WHY!?
[4:07:03] <+MadWolf1290> that's away enough
[4:07:06] <%weissguard> The Black Mages, ironically, moved.
[4:07:08] <+metal_gearxxx> @Bearheart223 I was replying to a different person. I know Elidibus is taking the WoL's form. In the cutscene though it is shown how Elidibus reached to the OG WoL to save the amaroutians.
[4:07:10] <%trueherobappo> trueherobappo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Good evening gang. Just thought I'd stop by to see what's going on with my favorite streamer. Hope you're all having a wonderful day and keep on keepin on brother. <3

[4:07:35] <%the22cstomp> and both having brink of death
[4:07:36] <+RocketBarrel> Is there an enrage in the normal fight?
[4:07:39] <%trueherobappo> @Estuko No problem brother.
[4:07:40] <Rei_Dsoto> This is Why id' go Lancer/Drgn or Dknt
[4:07:44] <%the22cstomp> no
[4:07:47] <%the22cstomp> afaik
[4:07:48] <DetroitSentai> hey man maybe the dps are just having an off day
[4:07:49] <%Birdigalore> I need the official lyrics to this song already
[4:07:56] <ItemNazo> cant you just Blackest night urself and keep DPS? Kappa
[4:07:57] <%danguinplays> healers got their work cut out for them
[4:08:01] <nsDrummer> theyre on YT
[4:08:02] <watts121> is this some of their first time?
[4:08:03] <bashful_bard> There could be an enrage but I doubt it
[4:08:04] <BlueVexer> Or they're first timers or sooooooooomething.
[4:08:05] <aeonicvector> Palom and Porom
[4:08:08] <+LittleBigQuebec> Twincast
[4:08:09] <DetroitSentai> Twins from FF4

[4:08:13] <%Nordguy> hey, do normal trials have enrage?
[4:08:15] <%Birdigalore> No enrage on normal
[4:08:16] <%fredan31> welkl*
[4:08:20] <SpookyBeef7> Normal versions don't normally have enrage mechanics.
[4:08:22] <%fredan31> well*
[4:08:27] <Lt_Campbell> I love the underlying synth in this song
[4:08:27] <floatRand> This fight is stuper-fun on extreme

[4:08:45] <%Birdigalore> BLACK MAGE RAGE QUIT
[4:08:47] <%Nupinoop296> oof
[4:08:47] <watts121> you gotta remember, you can't complete the story if you don't finish this fight
[4:08:48] <Otatoptohami> if only it said it in the chat log or something
[4:08:49] <nsDrummer> rip lb3
[4:08:51] <Lt_Campbell> AMAZING someone logged out
[4:08:51] <+SH1NK1R0> The original warrior of light was azem the 14th member of the convocation. Elidibus used their actions in order to spread legends and build a desire for salvation. He is not and has never been a warrior of light
[4:08:52] <+metal_gearxxx> the WHM is enjoying the view lmao
[4:08:52] <+RocketBarrel> BLM QUIT LOOOOOL
[4:08:53] <%the22cstomp> RAGE MAGE

[4:09:19] <%MegboyManuel> okay now do EX
[4:09:27] <Rei_Dsoto> oh crap
[4:09:31] <2DSuperiority> if it was a leave they wouldn't even be on the party list
[4:09:31] <KnightAsteran> with how comcast hates this game its probably a DC
[4:09:35] <+SH1NK1R0> Literally this appearance is azem themself
[4:09:36] <Otatoptohami> no enrage
[4:09:36] <%fredan31> How is this running so smooth?
[4:09:37] <%weissguard> What happened to that Baraka dude?

[4:09:45] <%LaughingCatt> does his normal mode enrage?
[4:09:47] <@spacecapncrone> dunno if there's an enrage here
[4:09:50] <KoyaMusa> *enrage
[4:09:50] <%the22cstomp> EX version of this fight is very fun
[4:09:51] <Animal_Farm4> Do the normal trials even have an enrage?
[4:10:00] <Otatoptohami> no it does not lol
[4:10:02] <BlueVexer> There's no way normal has an enrage.
[4:10:04] <DetroitSentai> yes some do have an enrage
[4:10:04] <%penitentpentwitch> He's just looping
[4:10:06] <Otatoptohami> it repeats over and over until its over
[4:10:07] <%Nupinoop296> OH NOOOO
[4:10:08] <gentlemanboxer> Adapt survive
[4:10:21] <+LittleBigQuebec> Meteors

[4:13:40] <+metal_gearxxx> @SH1NK1R0 how can the WoL be Azem if Elidibus literally has alzeheimers and cannot remember anything besides "I must save everyone"? Azem was the 14th memebr and was deliberately forgotten by (almost) all amaroutians because they opposed both Venat (Hydaelin solution) and the Convocation (Zodiark) solutions.
