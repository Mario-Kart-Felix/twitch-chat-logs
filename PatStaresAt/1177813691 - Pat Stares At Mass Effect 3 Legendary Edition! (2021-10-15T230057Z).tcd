[0:10:01] <%ScottishMadJacko> diagonal is for toasties only
[0:10:03] <%hereiam407> Its easier to get in diagonally
[0:10:03] <%AmericanSkidd> im a super freak

[0:10:13] <%afronooch> D:
[0:10:14] <%PocketBearIllustrator> consider me a freak, then.
[0:10:14] <%TDotGoat> triangles is the only correct way to cut a square
[0:10:15] <@GeneralSCPatton> Diagonal is a 41% longer cut, if the bread is square

[0:10:32] <%hereiam407> We should just roll our sandwiches in a ball, and try to shove it all in

[0:10:49] <%ahomeschooldropout> People that eat sandwiches like Kramer irl should be lined up against the wall
[0:10:50] <homestylewaffles> I eat all my fries first before the burger

[0:40:07] <intestinal_bleeding> i don't like beans but that's because I have crohns
[0:40:08] <+PenmanLupine> I've heard people be against beans being in chili and vice versa. it doesn't matter. put whatever you want in chili

[0:58:04] <%Ironclad_Jester> @dxlelouch24I think it's partly due to Pay deriving fun out of spite and him being tired from the gameplay, after binging the series

[0:58:47] <%greasypete00> wiknners do go into baby mode tho

[1:21:18] <jacobknight13> talk to the elcor!
[1:21:19] <%Torus1025> Good to know that Salarians can do cocaine too
[1:21:19] <blackjack8182> BLASTO RULES
[1:21:19] <Enajy314> LUL
[1:21:19] <Crownaux0> but no Elcor sidekick
[1:21:19] <+TungstenViper> BASED BLASTO
[1:21:20] <crazy_riggs> First Hanar spectre!
[1:21:22] <+s0lesurviv0r> next CW hero show
[1:21:23] <morningmoondude> Shepard is such a petty bitch to BLASTO
[1:21:23] <+DatAsuna> vorcha getting killed for jokes
[1:21:25] <%jillyrancher> They murdered him and nobody cares
[1:21:25] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt This DLC is literally a Yakuza game
[1:21:26] <%silvery_cricket> BLASTO VS KAI LANG WHO WINS
[1:21:26] <@goose_attack_almanac> I'm happy Blasto is an asshole
[1:21:27] <%TheBobulus> oh, hey, an elcor
[1:21:27] <%JoshManVGH> Why wasn't the reast of the game this campy bullshit!?!?
[1:21:27] <%shurtal> isnt this DLC the best?
[1:21:28] <olaksi> this is really tired slapstick ngl
[1:21:28] <%DrTomT18> yeah this DLC is pretty fucking wild
[1:21:31] <dawarw0lf> so Blasto 6 was about ME 2
[1:21:33] <@GeneralSCPatton> I don't know how to feel about this hot garbage
[1:21:35] <Goraka91> So racist you can casually kill a Vorcha
[1:21:36] <Teras_ode> It's okay everyone, the vorcha had only 2 years left Kappa
[1:21:37] <Tracazoid> The DLC being the best part of the game, again.
[1:21:38] <thebalticguy1> ALL ELCOR HAMLET
[1:21:41] <+xerotwo> Blasto better than Kai Leng CONFIRMED LUL
[1:21:41] <%JoshManVGH> @queequegtheater IT IS!
[1:21:42] <+DatAsuna> keep talking to him
[1:21:43] <BurdRightsActivist> Yeah blasto is cool, but is he COOLER THAN KAI LENG
[1:21:44] <%Bane_Kaikyo> that was way better than porn.... barely
[1:21:47] <%coward_man> I would kill for an entire game that's this
[1:21:49] <%RealThiele> Vorcha ARE just space goblins
[1:21:49] <OldManDeckardCain> blasto is what kai leng thinks of himself LUL
[1:21:49] <SaltyAzteca> Oh yeah Elcor Hamlet!
[1:21:49] <%afronooch> I wish they gave us elcor hamlet tbh
[1:21:53] <+tomdwarf> Oh man, the Elcor Hamlet production. It was like 7 hours right?
[1:21:55] <Shade075> Why just stop at him duel weilding tho, they shouldve gave him a gun in EVERY tentacle
[1:21:59] <%jillyrancher> YEAH ELCOR HAMLET
[1:22:00] <%DrTomT18> According to the Mass Effect Andamara book, Elcor SUPER LOVE SHAKESPEARE
[1:22:02] <%kyh9> Yep
[1:22:07] <crazy_riggs> Just a bar, not casino
[1:22:08] <SilverFaustX> ME4 should be yakuza in space
[1:22:09] <PaperyHornet1013> CHECK YOUR EMAIL
[1:22:10] <thebalticguy1> YEH NOW YOU CAN GAMBLE
[1:22:10] <+DatAsuna> He'll recite parts of the play if you keep talking to him
[1:22:10] <%ainzhelm> Be funny if Conrad Verner didn‚Äôt even know who blasto was
[1:22:14] <%DrTomT18> hey wait! there is something here! I think.
[1:22:18] <%DrTomT18> TURN AROUND!

[2:26:33] <jorniev> no
[2:26:36] <$MrWurmles> Their on your tv upstairs in your bedroom.
[2:26:36] <olm46> They're dickpics

[2:26:53] <cpt_langosta> thane sent lewds during war
[2:26:56] <SaltyAzteca> Thats a bummer man
[2:26:56] <%miguelrod777> yeah full on drell balls
[2:26:57] <blackjack8182> @brandon__brando No looter shooters! Only looter shooters!
[2:26:57] <%DrTomT18> Massive Frog Dick
[2:27:02] <+KevinSorbone> Thane shows hole
[2:27:02] <@QueequegTheater> They're not even of his dick
[2:27:11] <%RealThiele> frames go brrr
[2:27:12] <blackjack8182> Frog Dick
[2:27:13] <%InternetShis> Oh god the compression
[2:27:16] <+Armadelus> This entire series of events made me cry, I didn't particularly have a big attachment to Thane but these videos man.
[2:27:17] <Mattais88> 5 fps video messages
[2:27:30] <%MightyDuckShoes> what if he has a crazy tortoise dong?
[2:27:33] <+DatAsuna> One thing that's actually a bit far is: femshep who romanced thane gets a pseudo Thane force ghost in her head
[2:27:34] <%RealThiele> some max headroom quality
[2:27:45] <%InternetShis> That screen static made the quality fuckin die
[2:27:51] <Conscript_Gary> Seeing a loved one suffer a medical emergency is fucking rough
[2:27:55] <+DatAsuna> And then you ghosted him
[2:27:57] <+CyanDeadEye> He did
[2:27:57] <%VioletHeart> Communications are restricted due to war time.
[2:27:58] <%JamesCorck> Shepard was in isolation.
[2:27:58] <cpt_langosta> he tried, but prison
[2:27:59] <RrenDa> you were in space jail
[2:28:00] <%kyh9> He did, Alliance kept you from getting them
[2:28:00] <zerointelligence000> Thane why did you record this in 360p?
[2:28:01] <James_Quivers> Thane is a boomer and didn't know they went thru
[2:28:02] <@QueequegTheater> You were in prison
[2:28:03] <%baronblank> it said he tried to, didn't it
[2:28:04] <%JamesCorck> No messages made it through to him.
[2:28:05] <%InternetShis> Prison
[2:28:05] <%AmericanSkidd> i dont think they got through to you in prison
[2:28:06] <%GuilKato> you were in space jail @PatStaresAt
[2:28:06] <%sunsetdisc0> he tried. shepard was under house arrest and didnt get them
[2:28:06] <jacobknight13> alliance blocked them
[2:28:07] <%trackles_64> no comms sadge
[2:28:08] <karl_rex> Your comms were blocked while in  isolation
[2:28:16] <%Puhff> TXES?!
[2:28:17] <@ssjklyco> Except to Kai Lang
[2:28:19] <%DrTomT18> yeah it's weird that video quality in the super future is so shit
[2:28:22] <%InternetShis> You were in jail for the death of 300k evils
[2:28:24] <+eggypigeon> For that warcrime remember
[2:28:25] <tranquilturnip> "I'm legit, I pay taxes"
[2:28:25] <cpt_langosta> jailed for batarian "murder"
[2:28:25] <+SilverDevilfish> "I am not Yoshi"
[2:28:29] <Brandon__Brando> @blackjack8182 I cant wait for the era of those to die I hate that genre so much
[2:28:34] <SaltyAzteca> Kai "cereal eater" Leng
[2:28:35] <+KevinSorbone> The thirds is Kai Leng
[2:28:43] <blackjack8182> @brandon__brando Agreed
[2:28:45] <%hereiam407> Sad
[2:28:48] <%G_Thunders> Thane recorded this using his old flip phone
[2:28:49] <%Deft_Thought> BibleThump Thane
[2:29:07] <%AmericanSkidd> I appreciate how hard he tried to contact you
[2:29:14] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt There's a fourth one here if FemShep romanced him

[2:29:33] <%afronooch> :(
[2:29:36] <%HeroToxiko> so thats what it looks like
[2:29:42] <blue8moon> yes he did
[2:29:42] <%JamesCorck> Reminder. This guy beat Kai Leng's ass.
[2:29:42] <+DatAsuna> he did tho
[2:29:44] <%akscully> died making kai leng his bitch
[2:29:44] <%castlerock42> No, he did.
[2:29:45] <lloyddboy> but he did
[2:29:45] <karl_rex> Yeah he did
[2:29:46] <%Deft_Thought> Thane deserved better
[2:29:46] <%trackles_64> D
[2:29:47] <choocheess> they would've done well in the mojave
[2:29:47] <%Garthunox> he did die in hospital
[2:29:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he did tho
[2:29:48] <%trackles_64> F
[2:29:49] <%DrTomT18> :(
[2:29:49] <SaltyAzteca> He...did die in a hospital
[2:29:49] <+DatAsuna> They took him to the hospital after
[2:29:51] <natzo89> he did
[2:29:52] <%greasypete00> Sadge
[2:29:52] <%Monkeyweed21> he DID die in a hospital
[2:29:52] <%JamesCorck> Further proof that Kai Leng's a biiiiitch.
[2:29:52] <BattlexQueen> I forgot how weird thane is
[2:29:53] <Realimpact> but he did
[2:29:54] <%DrTomT18> look next to your bed?
[2:29:59] <%hereiam407> Lol
[2:30:01] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt There's a fourth one here if FemShep romanced him
[2:30:01] <+CyanDeadEye> Reminder: Thane did the suicide mission with his lungs at essentially less than half-capacity
[2:30:02] <Conscript_Gary> But he dies after kicking Kai Leng's ass
[2:30:04] <cpt_langosta> he lived by the streets, but he didn't die by the streets
[2:30:04] <%GuilKato> he did you die in the hospital - you converted to drell religion by reading their bible don't you remember?
[2:30:05] <@Ranryu692> he at least died in the hospital of wounds, rather than disease
[2:30:06] <blue8moon> he got stabbed in the street, then taken to the hospital to die
[2:30:08] <%InternetShis> He got stabbed there
[2:30:09] <Teras_ode> reminder that he still fucking owned the sonic OC despite his condition
[2:30:10] <%HeroToxiko> died doing what he loved, topping kai LUL
[2:30:11] <jorniev> oh man

[2:31:24] <%DrTomT18> weird that Liara never acts jelous
[2:31:30] <%castlerock42> I imagine it smells more like James in here.
[2:31:31] <%demiiluna> "Do you like the musk of the room I had Tali rub herself all on the piano."
[2:31:33] <%dekkitout> Reeks of cringe, purple, and pullups

[2:31:38] <choocheess> rooster teeth should make Purple vs. Blue
[2:31:57] <Parapattern> "It smells like 180 pull ups in here"

[4:18:11] <+DatAsuna> Shame, quiet party is great
[4:18:15] <%Ipsenscastle> I guarantee the quiet version will have your favourite ever mass effect scene
[4:18:16] <wolfen091> there's differences if you switch the moods halfway through
[4:18:17] <morningmoondude> Quiet party is another whole hour
[4:18:18] <blackjack8182> Nosedive in quality coming up
[4:18:19] <%GuilKato> report to the normandy they'll bang okay
[4:18:20] <%hereiam407> Sad
[4:18:22] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt If you romance Thane, there is a really touching scene here
[4:18:22] <Sp3ctre48> Do they really still use regular aspirin in the future?
[4:18:22] <%trackles_64> 4 hours
[4:18:24] <%hereiam407> music
[4:18:29] <Dio_TR> BibleThump
[4:18:29] <Moffin23> ah, still remember this scene all these years later
[4:18:30] <@GeneralSCPatton> The party should have ended with Kai Leng getting hit with an All Out Attack by the full squad

[4:19:13] <+SmigGames> it's bringing you back to the serious tone of the main story
[4:19:14] <%GuilKato> and then the ending goes into fanfic mode to fix the crucible
[4:19:14] <+TheotherKristian> PLAY CREDITS
[4:19:14] <James_Quivers> THE BEST
[4:19:16] <Mattais88> A year after the ending happens, makes sense thye'd do it

[4:19:17] <%hereiam407> Awwww
[4:19:18] <%JamesCorck> What's left is the apendices of Lord of the Rings.
[4:19:18] <+hatok> Pat there's a completely different version of the party you can have if you let it be rowdy

[4:19:49] <%GuilKato> check the shop for items?
[4:19:49] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt This is what happens when the developers are allowed to make their game rather than fight the corporation.
[4:19:50] <Brandon__Brando> fuck just end it here I dont want to relive the ending

[4:19:55] <%Monkeyweed21> This is just the end of All Good Things with Picard joining the poker game
[4:19:55] <%Garthunox> only shit from here on out

[4:20:00] <GoogleyGareth> Well when you fuck the real ending up you gotta make do
[4:20:00] <%CapnBeefs> Congrats Pat you beat MS3!!!!!!
[4:20:00] <%DrTomT18> Did you have fun, Pat?

[4:20:09] <TheWashoutXY> God I still hate the ending
[4:20:09] <tanarath> Because people played it after the ending & it hits different
[4:20:10] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Quiet party has a callback to Shepard Wrex
[4:20:10] <+DracosMagala> Peace
[4:20:10] <James_Quivers> Male sheps delivery of The Bets at the end there fuckin KILLS ME
[4:20:11] <stealthfart> Cut it off now. You beat the gsme
[4:20:12] <%JamesCorck> That was a great DLC.
[4:20:13] <%sunsetdisc0> TIME TO TURN OFF THE GAME, DELETE THE SAVE FILE, AND TELL YOURSELF THEY KILLED THE REAPERS AND THEY ALL LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER
[4:20:14] <Mattais88> Death March to teh Starchild
[4:20:15] <TheQuadrupleS> END OF GAME
[4:20:15] <%baronblank> oh dang, thought it was happenng tonight my bad
[4:20:16] <%afronooch> its 10/10 for sure
[4:20:16] <%JamesCorck> Best of the Best.
[4:20:16] <%Jeemukun> all downhill from here
[4:20:17] <jorniev> YES
[4:20:17] <SaltyAzteca> That was fun as fuck
[4:20:18] <pipboy344> @hatock He did ALL rowdy
[4:20:19] <+DatAsuna> With a POWER GAP
[4:20:19] <%JoshManVGH> That was amazing
[4:20:21] <$MrWurmles> Despite people's arguments about how this party is out of place in the story, I think this DLC does a good job of emphasizing what is personal about Shepard's role in this fight. (s)he's fighting for the sake of the galaxy yes, but more personally their fighting for the ones they care about. THAT'S what set the real shepard apart from the clone. The real shepard CARES.
[4:20:22] <+ryuguitarfreak> It came over 6 months after the main game
[4:20:22] <blakeway> I can't believe you missed eating cereal with your bestie kai leng
[4:20:22] <%justcallmebobplease> Because it's space antics!
[4:20:23] <%akscully> at least it was free
[4:20:23] <+TrevSmith222> And then Shepard and friends defeat the reapers and everyone early retires.  The End.
[4:20:25] <%TheBobulus> wow
[4:20:25] <+DatAsuna> It's not even close
[4:20:25] <%JamesCorck> Yeah, imagine playing the game BEFORE this DLC.
[4:20:26] <%justcallmebobplease> Everyone loves space antics!
[4:20:28] <%trackles_64> YOu had to buy it with Bioware points
[4:20:28] <+hatok> there's a whole other party you can doooooo
[4:20:30] <%AmericanSkidd> was it like a year after?
[4:20:32] <%bravebravesrobin> it was really good
[4:20:33] <teefpal> Next time is the poop
[4:20:33] <%peachy996> Did Pat ever go to Armax Arena and did the 6 Shepard fight?
[4:20:33] <ValentineWolf7> after all that crap and you had to pay for it
[4:20:34] <ZanRebel> the best DLC of any game ever :D
[4:20:34] <%Faustgesicht> Almost a year or year and a half after?
[4:20:35] <+SPARTAN_KD21> Came out like 15 months later
[4:20:37] <Dunmarkh> Do andromeda coward.
[4:20:38] <+hatok> energetic party
[4:20:38] <Goraka91> Kinda had to, they tried extra hard to say sorry
[4:20:41] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt they had to make the company happy first then do their own shit
[4:20:42] <%Kemmybelle> Beat the game, then do the quiet party as a better finale.
[4:20:42] <%peachy996> Or at least have Grunt+Wrex team
[4:20:43] <%GarbageNirvana> Man that did not feel like four hours
[4:20:54] <Dunmarkh> COWARDICE
[4:20:58] <%CapnBeefs> Andromeda is super garbage
[4:21:05] <wolfen091> raid porp
[4:21:08] <+DatAsuna> I like it more than inquisition, but I don't like inquisition
[4:21:08] <%Monkeyweed21> they wasted an ENTIRE galaxy on the most boring aliens ever
[4:21:11] <%trackles_64> Lies
[4:21:12] <blackjack8182> Andromeda is garbage
[4:21:13] <dawarw0lf> @mrwurmles yeah and the whole walk to the rapid transit has this bittersweet feeling that is lost if you do the dlc after the ending
[4:21:16] <@QueequegTheater> Andromeda has good stuff but it doesn't outweigh the shit
[4:21:18] <%Ipsenscastle> dumb
[4:21:20] <%BisoromiBear> mad hops
[4:21:22] <Visorak6> +2
[4:21:23] <blakeway> andromeda has good characters, it's a shame about everything else
[4:21:23] <%AmericanSkidd> science
[4:21:25] <jorniev> this was 4 hours?
[4:21:29] <jorniev> damn
[4:21:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> andromeda is a HOT MESS
[4:21:38] <%kyh9> READ IT
[4:21:43] <%peachy996> Andromeda is not worth streaming even though I enjoy tolerating it
[4:21:44] <%terry_irvin> terry_irvin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Hey pat, will you be checking out SMTV? It's coming next month and it would be so hype to see you play
[4:21:44] <%kyh9> DONT WATCH THAT SLIDE SHOW
[4:21:44] <%GuilKato> Pat get paige as tali costume!!!
[4:21:48] <%BisoromiBear> the manga has better animation
[4:21:52] <knight_verse> Too bad Pat didn't side with James, he missed the push up competition.
[4:21:53] <@QueequegTheater> House Husband is a visual comic not an anime
[4:21:54] <%alphonseisbest> GIGA BOOTS
[4:21:54] <%DrTomT18> Zone lol
[4:21:55] <+RelikaNox> Isn't watching it basically reading it anyway
[4:21:56] <+SPARTAN_KD21> I thought the characters were one of the weakest parts of Andromeda @blakeway
[4:21:56] <%BlackStarAura> Andromeda fucking crashed on me and I never bothered to finish it
[4:21:59] <%Ynkubus_> That anime is more of a motion comic
[4:22:01] <%GhoulishCripple> @blakeway funny enough it was the characters I disliked the most. the raw combat was serviceable
[4:22:05] <Brandon__Brando> Ive never felt this before I loved watching and reliving the series but I don't want to relive the ending
[4:22:05] <jorniev> whens no more hereos 3?
[4:22:06] <@Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt youv'e gotten more donations
[4:22:07] <%Fooguwu> pore puss?

[4:22:08] <%JamesCorck> o7
[4:22:08] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt If you side with James, there's a pushup competition
[4:22:11] <+DatAsuna> Time to load up the game and play quiet party myself right now lol
[4:22:14] <%JamesCorck> Farewell!
[4:22:17] <tanarath> STFU EMLO
[4:22:17] <dawarw0lf> @peachy996 agree, I still haven't played it again after the first time
[4:22:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> ITS MY BIRTHDAY @PatStaresAt
