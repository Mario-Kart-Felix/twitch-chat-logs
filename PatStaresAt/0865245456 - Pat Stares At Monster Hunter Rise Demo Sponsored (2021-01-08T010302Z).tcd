[0:17:57] <%AzureGale> But the other handler is Eden Riegel
[0:17:57] <%Higure_yoru> GUILDMARM NUMBER 1
[0:17:58] <%Veldime> Serious Handler has no personality
[0:17:59] <+BootyFriend> Uhh... Guildmarm much?
[0:18:01] <Warbot40> Because she ain't the normal handler
[0:18:04] <penitentpendant> But Papa Nier Though

[0:28:32] <hamborgini> there are also other monsters that aren't the target, so there's more like four monsters

[0:30:27] <jotabranded> LUL
[0:30:27] <MyNameIsRasus> i mean it looks way worse too
[0:30:28] <rufus2k2> rip mt framework you did good old timer
[0:30:29] <+NecDW4> First GS in the demo, already more personality than everyt GS iun MHW
[0:30:30] <Pyrrhus90> LUL
[0:30:31] <%JamesCorck> Pat, what's the framerate?
[0:30:34] <%kyh9> MAX IS PLAYING WITH 3 OTHER PEOPLE AND ITS SMOOTH AS BUTTER
[0:30:35] <Zeif00> Smaller Map + Less Shit all over will do that
[0:30:36] <%AncelDeLambert> LOOK AT THAT CHARGE SPEED
[0:30:37] <Laecerelius> Been watching Max play with a full party and it's running fine
[0:30:38] <%FacetiousAF> on a switch no less 🤔
[0:30:39] <$RealThiele> optimization go
[0:30:39] <%super_ej8> i would pogchamp right now if I could Kappa
[0:30:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WORSE GRAPHICS THO
[0:30:41] <%ssjklyco> Better than Age of Calamity it seems
[0:30:41] <+paladinstarbuster> does it
[0:30:42] <%ChrisPlaysThing> also has obvious missing visuals tho ~
[0:30:42] <+Jaysky> Now I'm ANGRY
[0:30:44] <@SSaryn> The fact REngine is so fucking scalable is fantastic
[0:30:47] <%kyh9> @JamesCorck 30 probably. But a locked 30
[0:30:49] <%DappercatEsquire> i remember the weapons changing size between sheathed/unsheathed in the 3DS games bothering me so goddamn much
[0:30:50] <%mikessdd> So FAST
[0:30:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> No one cares about graphics tho
[0:30:57] <%AzureGale> This VA seems okay
[0:30:58] <+Beniial> its probably got a shitton of optimization to make the switch not melt
[0:30:58] <brachydios777> WAY FASTER
[0:31:00] <Grimsever88> I like seeing the butt when swing
[0:31:09] <+demon1103> its crazy isnt it...tho i feel fps will have issues when 8 things are simultaneously wailing on some poor monster
[0:31:12] <%Livelinne> shiaLove
[0:31:14] <%VioletHeart> I missed the old aesthetic. Nice to see it looks a lot more like MonHun again.
[0:31:17] <%SirGO0SE> frames look like its on 3ds
[0:31:18] <%BoxNavy> that was in world
[0:31:19] <@SSaryn> Oh thats good
[0:31:19] <cherrycottontail> The fps still doesn't look that great
[0:31:20] <$RealThiele> oh no foreplay
[0:31:23] <%AzureGale> AHA YOU'RE HERE
[0:31:23] <Mangahero18> I just tuned in. Is this the Pokemon-esque RPG or the other one.

[0:31:24] <%AncelDeLambert> ... didn't it already have that?
[0:31:25] <%twistedj3ster> The RE engine is prolly my favorite right now
[0:31:25] <%twoto858> I think this is the gear of the Goss Harag monster we saw in the trailer
[0:31:26] <Zombrocom> Thats the same as world dude

[0:33:00] <rufus2k2> is there any hope of bugs coming back
[0:33:04] <Mangahero18> This doesnt look half bad for a switch only game but Im not a huge enough fan of MH to bother with Nintendo Online. Man I BARELY use my switch.
[0:33:04] <pokefan9956> does this have world's armor skill system or the old system?
[0:33:12] <Mangahero18> How does this run on switch anyway?
[0:33:12] <%jorniev> HOWS THE GAME PAT?
[0:33:13] <highfivesquash> Aha, you're here!
[0:33:14] <%twoto858> Now do it with the weapon drawn

[0:33:23] <Th3rd3> Strider Sensei!!
[0:33:31] <%AzureGale> A HA YER HEAR
[0:33:32] <%d1stantutopia> @pokefan9956 unknown, you can't check skills in the demo
[0:33:32] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Haha! You're here!
[0:33:35] <+zeraux_> i really like world
[0:33:37] <@SSaryn> Looks like Straight into hop.
[0:33:37] <penitentpendant> I keep thinking my fire alarm is going off with that alert sound
[0:33:38] <%cvp5127> strider?
[0:33:39] <%BoxNavy> is that zinogre armor?
[0:33:39] <brachydios777> Hay strider
[0:33:40] <josemoya95> that is qjat he is going to teach you

[0:33:46] <+buttdirt> thrash METAL?!
[0:33:49] <%twoto858> He wearing Zinogre armor?
[0:33:50] <+NecDW4> RDY 2 THRS
[0:33:52] <%kyh9> SAY THE DEMO PART
[0:33:53] <%BoxNavy> the armor utsushi is wearing
[0:33:54] <%Monkeyweed21> yes they kept the tent
[0:33:55] <susukouhai> looks like fashion hunter
[0:33:56] <Mangahero18> I feel like this should have been the game they use to launch interest in the next switch version.
[0:34:00] <pilllowofbees> @BoxNavy no new monster
[0:34:06] <%twistedj3ster> Now I'm wondering how RE2 would run on the Switch
[0:34:12] <+JonJonRequiem> I agree
[0:34:15] <SummonerMagno> at the van down by the river
[0:34:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> I would lay money on the fact that we won't see another PC native Monster Hunter game.
[0:34:20] <butthurtdave> I still get lost navigating the jungle
[0:34:21] <penitentpendant> They were 'too 3d' in a few cases
[0:34:26] <+Jaysky> The forest was very complicated but the others were fine
[0:34:27] <%AncelDeLambert> that looks pretty complicated to me, Pat
[0:34:27] <%Monkeyweed21> only if you are a basic bitch
[0:34:28] <+NecDW4> It WAS a little easy to get lost in MHW
[0:34:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ports, sure. But not like MHW
[0:34:29] <highfivesquash> Woah he's a ninha
[0:34:35] <%BigLoserJosh> fuck going through ancient forest
[0:34:36] <+Jaysky> Forest just had a lot of upper areas
[0:34:37] <+CookieCutter007> DansGame radial
[0:34:43] <+Gespens> World had nice visual design to the levels, but navigating them was awful. Especially the Dalamadur Carcass level
[0:34:44] <%Zundelle> the areas in world felt like they broke monster ai and animations half the time
[0:34:44] <josemoya95> the forest definetly was
[0:34:45] <%코코꾸라> @PatStaresAt The SNK stuff is happening in 20 minutes!
[0:34:50] <%VioletHeart> Having the maps so dense in World meant there were rarely opportunities to just stand in an arena and fight a monster. You were always tripping over terrain.
[0:34:52] <%dekkitout> Are whetstones back to finite- pls tell me no
[0:34:54] <%d1stantutopia> PUTAWAYYOURWEAPON PLEASE
[0:35:01] <AlexDaGr8> is your dick blown off yet
[0:35:06] <%d1stantutopia> @dekkitout From what I've seen, now
[0:35:06] <%Dreadlord134> The npc never landed
[0:35:08] <%d1stantutopia> *no
[0:35:15] <%SirGO0SE> something tells me this sound effect would make paige have to pee
[0:35:15] <Mangahero18> Infinite whetstone yay
[0:35:22] <@SSaryn> New whetstone sound is ok
[0:35:23] <Lixagon> Why do you sound like chris redfeild
[0:35:26] <%BoxNavy> on the boldores :)
[0:35:31] <Profmcstevie> Those birds are in my ear and I hate it
[0:35:35] <MassConnect> so is this expansion or new base game?
[0:35:36] <highfivesquash> If you insert the Monster Hunter (tm) cartridge incorrectly, your dick will be blown off.
[0:35:43] <%kyh9> Hold ZL

[0:36:25] <%dekkitout> Standby for Wire Fall

[0:37:30] <penitentpendant> Ever since they revealed the Wire Bugs, I've assumed there will be at least 1 "THE FLOOR IS LAVA" fight. If not earthquake type mechanics
[0:37:33] <rufus2k2> that or bring back the simlish equivalent....huntrish?
[0:37:39] <%d1stantutopia> @rufus2k2 There is already a turn off voices option, in the demo even! They said this months ago!

[0:39:39] <%ssjklyco> They seem to have Amateratsu animation
[0:39:41] <+Bubbagump282> Is there an option to turn English off and go back to the old fashioned MH Simlish?
[0:39:42] <$Afterman_> I think this is honestly my favorite map so far in a monhun game
[0:39:43] <%kyh9> USE THE DRIFT

[0:39:51] <Profmcstevie> DOGGO GOT A KNIFE, I hope he can sharpen it
[0:39:52] <%d1stantutopia> @dekkitout Wasn't a beasthandler a concept weapon for the original MH game?
[0:39:52] <+Jaysky> I never bought Iceborne although I'm sure it's fun I just felt I had my fill

[0:45:05] <+NecDW4> oh no, i missed the BLUD
[0:45:05] <+Jaysky> I've loved insect glaive since it's inception and yet I can't deny it's getting shafted since they keep adding mobility
[0:45:10] <%Higure_yoru> 3ds one had something similar I think
[0:45:12] <Nordguy> ooooh check that shsroness gauge
[0:45:13] <UnfilteredComic> Yeah this is VERY new

[0:45:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Is there a difference between World and Rise as a series?
[0:45:40] <%ChrisPlaysThing> The Grinneer prey on the weak, but we, we prey on the Grinneer
[0:45:40] <ManfredA> Sword and Shield literally let you skip the handholding
[0:45:43] <MassConnect> next world game? what is a world game?
[0:45:44] <pilllowofbees> @Jaysky yeah will its always been the mobility weapon

[0:45:52] <DerpioParty> Unnecessary smoke bomb
[0:45:53] <$RealThiele> spiderman

[0:46:09] <%NopeBadguy> bro what did you even latch onto
[0:46:10] <Wraithakiin> this is not a spin off, it's a whole ass game
[0:46:11] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[0:46:15] <+Jaysky> @Pookiedaexzile Seems so. In fact this has a buttton of new mechanics to mess with
[0:46:16] <Daxalog> Did this eat a quest?
[0:46:17] <butthurtdave> Is there not a combo chart or weapon breakdown menu like in World?
[0:46:24] <%kyh9> TWO wirebug attacks
[0:46:25] <%BoxNavy> 2
[0:46:26] <@SSaryn> @patstaresat DELETING THE SAVE RESETS THE COUNTER
[0:46:29] <%baka_sugoi> its so JAPANESE

[0:46:34] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt The dog attacks too and mimics your move set
[0:46:36] <%Captainahab_37> with his sword arm

[0:46:46] <Oxybe> So my pro controller is dead
[0:46:48] <Mangahero18> am I crazy or is that dogger doing a Tatsumaki
[0:46:48] <Vyskus> it's a genius move to make the dogs do like a fastball special when you hit them instead of making you feel bad with a hurt animation
[0:46:52] <rufus2k2> that new ice monster has a move that reminds me of gamera
[0:46:52] <+Jaysky> That oni polar bear monster is indeed sick af

[0:47:29] <goblinpuppy> IMPORTANT QUESTION: Is Zangeif going to the the First Dog or the Strongest dog?
[0:47:29] <%kyh9> TITANFALL MOTHERFUCKERS
[0:47:31] <Profmcstevie> Wirebugs the "poster" mechanic, CONTROL MONSTER is the real shit
[0:47:33] <brachydios777> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm

[0:48:02] <+Gespens> I hated the Slinger so much LUL
[0:48:03] <pokefan9956> what the heck is the point of the slinger
[0:48:03] <%d1stantutopia> LUL
[0:48:06] <%Deft_Thought> Why not both
[0:48:07] <fojidoj> Friendship with clutch claw over
[0:48:08] <%baka_sugoi> how is the ice world?
[0:48:09] <%d1stantutopia> "but the clutch claw!"
[0:48:09] <%BoxNavy> SLINGER AND CC DansGame
[0:48:12] <+JonJonRequiem> Slinger sucks big booty
[0:48:14] <%machshop> i love the slinger
[0:48:15] <%ChrisPlaysThing> World 2 would be nice
[0:48:16] <%dekkitout> The wire bug is a better slinger in every way
[0:48:20] <+TheIntellectional> slinger is fine, it was clutch claw that was annoying imo
[0:48:20] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> poprque no los dos?
[0:48:21] <%BoxNavy> NO CLUTCH CLAW PLEASE
[0:48:21] <%machshop> :(
[0:48:25] <%BoxNavy> that KILLED iceborne
[0:48:28] <$RealThiele> his talk animations are very excited
[0:48:29] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "Option Select"
[0:48:29] <tetriata> Bring back the slinger, but only for the lance
[0:48:29] <%d1stantutopia> Nah, just gimme wirebug
[0:48:31] <%Deft_Thought> Hell, give the players the choice between Slinger and Clutch Claw
[0:48:32] <%Captainahab_37> the world e3 reveal was cool
[0:48:33] <rasamune> Utsushi means "reflect"
[0:48:33] <%Reveresao> game is too loud @PatStaresAt

[0:48:49] <%Captainahab_37> fuck the choice make a clutch bug
[0:48:53] <defaultname3887> mhw 2 styles: wire bug, clawsling, steam engine
[0:48:54] <%YakumoYomi> Clutch Claw would have been fine if it wasn't lumped with the "softening" mechanic.

[0:54:45] <Flakari> You're on GS
[0:54:45] <VJdarkworld> greatest long sword
[0:54:52] <%Monkeyweed21> slow down and read

[0:55:25] <VJdarkworld> pat created new weapon in his brain of Great Long Sword
[0:55:27] <himbearbedtime> @RocketBarrel Locked at 30
[0:55:33] <%baka_sugoi> i can never stomach the no damage falling in the game
[0:55:34] <RocketBarrel> @ssaryn boooo
[0:55:38] <ManfredA> give em the ol' dick twist
[0:55:44] <%ScreamLord> Look at that Zinogre arm on ninja guy. ZInogre confirmed?
[0:55:50] <%mikessdd> Apparently the multiplayer stream was holding up well though.
[0:55:55] <%kyh9> BLADEMASTERS ARE BACK
[0:55:56] <+Jaysky> Why the hell would you want fall damage?
[0:55:58] <butthurtdave> Are you planning on demoing all weapons or just focusing on a couple of your mains?
[0:55:59] <@SSaryn> Trust me its fine, its running smooth as fuck
[0:56:06] <Reanimator83> How does this game run compared to the last one on the switch?
[0:56:06] <%Deft_Thought> That's the Yian Garuga set, right?
[0:56:11] <pilllowofbees> @baka_sugoi why fall damage always sucks
[0:56:12] <%d1stantutopia> NO MEAT
[0:56:20] <Profmcstevie> Give me my double BBQ spit damn you
[0:56:22] <%warlockwithapixie> what's up with the audio quality?
[0:56:26] <RocketBarrel> Ehh should've been expected I guess. The Switch would've chugged hard trying to do 60 fps
[0:56:26] <%kyh9> No, that's MagnaMalo armor
[0:56:31] <%ScreamLord> But he has Zinogre bits on his arm
[0:56:32] <%warlockwithapixie> music sounds crispy
[0:56:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> I was horrified the online would run terrible cause nintendo
[0:56:33] <ManfredA> fall damage is so alien to MonHun
[0:56:33] <@SSaryn> Oh hey free Puppeteer ride.
[0:56:34] <koffeemancer> I think its magnamalo
[0:56:34] <%kyh9> That's flagship monster armor

[1:04:29] <Vyskus> sound is very hard can confirm
[1:04:33] <%d1stantutopia> Honestly, if Pat did a stream that wasn't a complete disaster I would feel like I'm not getting my money's worth
[1:04:38] <%baka_sugoi> psaUp no ping nice
[1:04:46] <ancrest_tant> Sound is literally a science
[1:04:46] <$RealThiele> ping
[1:04:47] <+zeraux_> are the animations faster?
[1:04:55] <%CzeekyPlays> Reminds me of Valorheart from DS3 DLC
[1:04:55] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> is this the new monster hunter?
[1:05:00] <Vyskus> is the sound stuttering now or is that me
[1:05:03] <@commanderclaw> Seems like 10% faster too
[1:05:05] <%dekkitout> It seems faster if that's what you mean
[1:05:09] <%Monkeyweed21> no it isn't thats round slash
[1:05:10] <%baka_sugoi> parry?
[1:05:10] <goblinpuppy> new demo
[1:05:11] <defaultname3887> they took some reposition things for sns tho
[1:05:13] <PanicSwytch> I might have to change my main weapon in this game
[1:05:13] <UnfilteredComic> Guard Point
[1:05:14] <%jorniev> PARRY?
[1:05:16] <nutimik> is the water sound lowered every time he swings his sword?
[1:05:16] <+zeraux_> guard slash ?
[1:05:18] <%FluffiTamamo> Motherfuck, does he get special-boy early copy too? Or did the demo finallt drop?
[1:05:20] <dekkitout> Guard up? Lance had the blue aura in mhw
[1:05:21] <$Afterman_> man that armor is fucking sick
[1:05:24] <josemoya95> guard point
[1:05:25] <%Ironbuttz> if that's a parry I will scream
[1:05:26] <defaultname3887> also doubt pat new all the newances
[1:05:30] <%BoxNavy> guard points flash now?
[1:05:30] <ManfredA> yeah SnS has guard points now @PatStaresAt
[1:05:32] <pokefan9956> if sword and shield gets a parry I'll nut
[1:05:33] <Tha_Mik> The sound is definetly acting weird
[1:05:37] <DublinRage> @poohtrailsnailcooch yeah. Pat got an early code for Rise Demo
[1:05:39] <KnightAsteran> could you please stand away from the loud ass river

[1:06:08] <%kyh9> Weird you can't throw the shield captain america style
[1:06:08] <nutimik> like an aggressive compressor
[1:06:39] <ancrest_tant> @vyskus my guess is that he put such an agressive limiter that anytime that another sound comes in it ducks everything else
[1:06:42] <Zombrocom> Guard Slash into perfect Rush. Do da Parry
[1:06:45] <$StrawberryPantsu> YEYEYEYEYE

[1:08:02] <spectre_shrimp> @KnightAsteran oh ok
[1:08:06] <UnfilteredComic> If you land that you go into perfect rush
[1:08:08] <%Monkeyweed21> guard slash with a guard point @PatStaresAt
[1:08:08] <%dekkitout> Has to be a guard up or perfect guard
[1:08:09] <%twoto858> I think the blue flash means you can cancel it into something else?
[1:08:21] <%kyh9> Guard?
[1:08:27] <%AllenDeadman> they gave it a GUARD POINT?

[1:09:02] <%Monkeyweed21> oils suck
[1:09:09] <%skyentombment> DO-ELLE WIELD
[1:09:24] <josemoya95> its guard point to the iceborne perfect rush
[1:09:24] <%BoxNavy> @Gespens you dont need oils when you can easily out DPS greatsword with one perfect rush :)
[1:09:26] <%ScreamLord> Don't recognize that set. I think it's the new spider monster
[1:09:26] <%crimsonharvest> wonder if this will do even better on an overclocked switch
[1:09:28] <%Monkeyweed21> fuck sword oils these moves are waybetter
[1:09:29] <%Kaask> yup, that's a dual blade
[1:09:36] <$RealThiele> dancer?

[1:10:09] <UnfilteredComic> A KNIFE
[1:10:09] <%crimsonharvest> did she flip them off
[1:10:09] <+Gespens> @Gespens It's less about the damage and more how Oils mixed up the playstyle and let SnS play super efficient
[1:10:12] <Saltmeisterr> dual blade looks dumb af
[1:10:13] <+BubbaRands> Yup that's a dual blade anime character LUL
[1:10:14] <josemoya95> that glow looks very nice

[1:10:28] <Bigyanno> Charge Blade best blade
[1:10:30] <nutimik> this weapon is ugly as shit though

[1:10:44] <%mikessdd> Lancer
[1:10:45] <%crimsonharvest> so it becomes a shotgun power fist
[1:10:46] <%Konquerer> Charge Blade is the only one that matters

[1:17:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @fojidoj And Gunlance is for BIG BOOMS
[1:17:17] <%vaporousTippler> Time for I-No combos.
[1:17:18] <%kyh9> UREAD THE NOTES
[1:17:20] <butthurtdave> you're at full health?
[1:17:21] <%dekkitout> Weapon Art: "One Man Band"
[1:17:21] <%BoxNavy> why is what not playing?
[1:17:21] <majindusto> Is that a BATTLE GUITAR?
[1:17:24] <%d1stantutopia> And if you fill the gauge next to the notes, you combo into another move that does a horn-specific buff
[1:17:25] <thesubgenius912> you need all 3 notes on your bar
[1:17:25] <PE4X> read the notes
[1:17:27] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> More like the hunting axe
[1:17:27] <himbearbedtime> @wasdknife only on switch for now, rumors about other platforms in 6 months
[1:17:28] <Zeif00> YOu are playing
[1:17:31] <+Jaysky> Maybe you need to take damage first?
[1:17:34] <%baka_sugoi> THE NOTES PAT
[1:17:34] <KingVantq> @PatStaresAt they play automatically after pressing the button twice

[1:17:41] <%AnIcedCoffee> balls shown on stream
[1:17:43] <valriot> PAT, ITS ALREADY PLAYED
[1:17:44] <%Agami23> check moves?
[1:17:45] <%AllenDeadman> when you get the notes around you that's when it plays?
[1:17:46] <%d1stantutopia> Pat it's a burst heal, not a buff
[1:17:49] <Zombrocom> It's not a buff, it's a burst heal
[1:17:49] <+koroshi60> not a buff just a heal
[1:17:51] <%BoxNavy> you only perform for self improvement and damage now
[1:17:54] <josemoya95> its doesnt play like that anymroe
[1:17:55] <A_Red_Robot> It's not a buff, it's a straight up heal
[1:17:58] <Zombrocom> You play it, it heals you. Its not a buff
[1:18:05] <+blaze__drag> the buff plays automatically when you play the same two notes in a row
[1:18:05] <Psyramics> maybe take some damage first and see when it heals
[1:18:06] <+demon1103> you're at full health pat...its a heal
[1:18:07] <wasdknife> @d1stantutopia ok thanks
[1:18:07] <%Jaxnos> pat, you're playing them, that's what the music note sphere is
[1:18:08] <butthurtdave> health recovery is a heal, not a passive buff
[1:18:08] <%supergoblinpunch> Wait, no recital?
[1:18:09] <+TenKaiHunter> You have to activate it everytime
[1:18:11] <+gaemjurnalist> wait is the demo available to everyone or did pat make another dark pact with the elder gods again?
[1:18:12] <+BubbaRands> @doc_ock_rokc me charge blade brain me no do bard

[1:18:14] <%jorniev> THESE WOUND WILL NOT HEAL!
[1:18:21] <+blaze__drag> if all you do is press A then A you get the attack buff!
[1:18:26] <Insignium> @PatStaresAt Health Recovery (S) is not a buff but a small heal instead
[1:18:29] <pilllowofbees> @gaemjurnalist its out now
[1:18:34] <majindusto> Ok...NOW I FINALLY WANT TO PLAY A MONSTER HUNTER GAME
[1:18:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BubbaRands Hunting horn is just better unga bunga
[1:18:40] <%Dakuu75> I don't get it
[1:18:41] <%crimsonharvest> its like the insect, you get all 3 colors?
[1:18:44] <%d1stantutopia> PAT, YOU GET THE BUFF JUST FROM PLAYING, YOU DON'T NEED TO PERFORM
[1:18:44] <%Ironbuttz> so it store melodies, and then you activate?
[1:18:45] <+blaze__drag> songs are literally played by just repeating 2 of the same note as soon as you play the note
[1:18:47] <%AllenDeadman> HH REWORK
[1:18:53] <Klarrann3> the buffs are active, you can see above your health bar
[1:18:54] <highfivesquash> wow
[1:18:55] <%Jekado> is he... beatboxing as his idle?
[1:18:57] <$RealThiele> so you have to push the old notes out of the bar to play
[1:18:58] <+blaze__drag> pressing ZR is its own note
[1:18:58] <%vaporousTippler> A Hunter Horn Reborn.
[1:19:00] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> so the downside of this is that the buff doesn't last as long ?

[1:22:36] <Profmcstevie> My IQ is increasing just watching a Hunting Horn
[1:22:39] <pilllowofbees> @penitentpendant I think he does actually LUL
[1:22:40] <%Jaxnos> you gotta hit somethin to feel demon circle

[1:22:53] <PanicSwytch> Breaker Style HH
[1:22:53] <Mangahero18> that looks fucking cool
[1:22:53] <josemoya95> L2 as a combo hit
[1:22:54] <%Hiro01231> Hiro01231 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[1:22:56] <%Blank9> it's so good
[1:22:57] <%TrafficCohen> HH has to be like this in all the games from now on
[1:22:58] <%BoxNavy> @PatStaresAt you didnt even see all the new stuff hammer got. its almost like valor hammer from gu now
[1:22:59] <%patriotrenegade> BIG IF TRUE
[1:22:59] <%Jaxnos> HH gang, pow pow
[1:23:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @valriot You speak as if it wasn't king before HH has some sick dps in world
[1:23:00] <%baka_sugoi> dats COOL
[1:23:02] <%Dakuu75> BIG CLIPPING
[1:23:03] <rufus2k2> lol /v/ said HH was dumbed down
[1:23:06] <%kyh9> THAT ARMOR IS NNUTS
[1:23:07] <%AllenDeadman> I will take the death of insect glaive for this HH rework
[1:23:10] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> I wan to know what is the catch now
[1:23:12] <%Emperor_Machinus> Will Pat be switching from greatsword to Hunterhorn now?
[1:23:14] <+AWr00tBear> Not all of Gunlance moves are in the demo yet. :(
[1:23:17] <%Deft_Thought> Man, do I have to get a Switch now?
[1:23:18] <+TenKaiHunter> Hunting Horn is new Tomfa
[1:23:26] <Dave_VD> Crap im gonna have to go back and watch the weapons I missed
[1:23:32] <%CzeekyPlays> any board on 4chan has all invalid opinions
[1:23:33] <+bustawof> I felt like my loyalty to HH was rewarded
[1:23:33] <%BoxNavy> lance :)
[1:23:34] <%d1stantutopia> @PatStaresAt You can unsheath straight into a perform to Self Improve, and you can also unsheath into any note instead of just X
[1:23:34] <+Gespens> MY FAVORITE BORING WEAPON
[1:23:34] <%TrafficCohen> >Lance ResidentSleeper
[1:23:35] <%dekkitout> Big poke time
[1:23:36] <majindusto> How is a Guitar a Horn tho lol
[1:23:41] <%baka_sugoi> NICE
[1:23:43] <keiji_maede> HH Baby!!
[1:23:43] <penitentpendant> Deploy the Poke
[1:23:43] <%Emperor_Machinus> @TenKaiHunter No, still want tonfa
[1:23:44] <%Jaxnos> that is a long shaft
[1:23:46] <+TrulyAmiracle> Hey Pat, KoFXV trailer just released if you're intersted
[1:23:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @JusTTheGuyYouNeed hunting horn buffs are super short and the range is slightly less according to some
[1:23:48] <%crimsonharvest> the simplest perfect guards
[1:23:48] <DestroyerPhoenix> that armor set and lance look fuckin sick
[1:23:51] <rasamune> Lance cures Diablos
[1:23:53] <rufus2k2> Dukemon!
[1:23:53] <thelonechris> It's basically a big pointy stick
[1:23:53] <%baka_sugoi> F O O T S I E S
[1:23:54] <pilllowofbees> LUL y'all are never getting the tonfas now
[1:23:55] <%cvp5127> you can charge the sweep
[1:23:55] <cherrycottontail> lance, the best* weapon
[1:23:58] <%thetrashman_sc> poke
[1:23:59] <%SGrim> @PatStaresAt it also charges
[1:23:59] <$StrawberryPantsu> The Tail Cutter
[1:23:59] <+zeraux_> i think all the animations are a bit fasrer
[1:24:00] <fatcrab> lance good
[1:24:00] <Saltmeisterr> poke poke
[1:24:06] <+zeraux_> faster*
[1:24:09] <%BoxNavy> theres a super block with lance now
[1:24:09] <%crimsonharvest> the simplest guarding through unblockables
[1:24:10] <%Blank9> if you get hit during the blue guard, you auto-counter
[1:24:11] <marklarphd> That lance and armor looks great
[1:24:12] <%AllenDeadman> let me preach for the church of dodge lance
[1:24:12] <%charp35> all this gear is 100 times better than world
[1:24:12] <josemoya95> not a guard vut a charge
[1:24:15] <+BubbaRands> Lance goes P O K E
[1:24:16] <%TrafficCohen> Tonfas were in what? Online only?
[1:24:20] <%supergoblinpunch> Please let Lance be Tri good again
[1:24:20] <%crimsonharvest> got the hop still?
[1:24:23] <%Blank9> it's really good for attacking super fast through attacks
[1:24:23] <+Jaysky> Lance has always been a very consistent and reliable weapon
[1:24:25] <%twoto858> Lance is good for small brain like me
[1:24:26] <Nordguy> what in the world is a Guard Point
[1:24:27] <nutimik> Oh shit armor that actually looks like armor and not like pieces of monster flesh strapped to your body
[1:24:27] <%Blank9> tonfas were in Frontier
[1:24:30] <%Ironbuttz> guarding advance in 4 direction still?
[1:24:31] <%twoto858> P O K E
[1:24:37] <pilllowofbees> yeah tonfas were online only
[1:24:40] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> @doc_ock_rokc since you can probably keep buffing while fighting, that is not so bad i guess
[1:24:41] <%Blank9> guard point's an attack that blocks during the animation
[1:24:41] <%crimsonharvest> ok now do the shield moves
[1:24:44] <+Gespens> We'll NEVER get Medium Bowgun back
[1:24:44] <RetributionP> the reverse direction during charge?
[1:24:49] <+Jaysky> Whatever this armor is looks slick
[1:24:51] <rufus2k2> I love that pointy nose faceplate
[1:24:55] <%ScreamLord> SHIVE
[1:24:56] <%baka_sugoi> AA
[1:24:59] <%kyh9> tHat's a counter
[1:24:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> @JusTTheGuyYouNeed yeah pretty much
[1:25:03] <%TrafficCohen> Maybe I mixed up Tonfas with Medium Bowguns
[1:25:03] <%cvp5127> zl + a
[1:25:04] <rasamune> @Nordguy If you're in the middle of an attack animation where your shield is in front of you, you block if you get hit on that frame
[1:25:04] <%RigmaRolle> WILLIAM
[1:25:04] <penitentpendant> QuickTurns
[1:25:05] <%thetrashman_sc> DEJA VU
[1:25:06] <%kyh9> One is a jump and the other is a counter
[1:25:12] <+TenKaiHunter> @Emperor_Machinus Me too. I wanted them to bring it back for this game. I'll just have to wait a bit longer.
[1:25:13] <josemoya95> that binds you to the monters like a bungie cord
[1:25:14] <Vyskus> guard point is a move where the shield is in front of the character, so you get hit during you still block attacks
[1:25:15] <%Emperor_Machinus> Is this demon souls?
[1:25:15] <%d1stantutopia> BIG COUNTER
[1:25:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> BIG PARRY
[1:25:20] <Profmcstevie> Armor Lock LUL
[1:25:23] <+Jaysky> I want to be able to drift with my lance
[1:25:23] <%Blank9> medium bowguns are mh3
[1:25:27] <+koroshi60> you get an attack boost based on how big the attack is
[1:25:27] <%FacetiousAF> @Emperor_Machinus no this is patrick
[1:25:34] <+Jaysky> Initial D Lancer
[1:25:35] <%twoto858> HUH?!
[1:25:38] <%crimsonharvest> you'll what
[1:25:40] <%Emperor_Machinus> xD
[1:25:42] <%Dakuu75> AUTO-COUNTER, what is this baby-mode, shit lol
[1:25:44] <%CzeekyPlays> C A N C E L
[1:25:50] <+koroshi60> agggro mechaninc
[1:25:59] <%AllenDeadman> BIG TANk
[1:26:06] <+Gespens> Oh, so its the best Lance Hunter Arts from Generations
[1:26:06] <%BoxNavy> aggro is kinda in the game now i guess
[1:26:06] <%d1stantutopia> AGGRO MECHANIC
[1:26:12] <+zeraux_> sick
[1:26:12] <pilllowofbees> its a titanfall grapple
[1:26:13] <%crimsonharvest> launch yourself into fireball?
[1:26:13] <RetributionP> woah
[1:26:14] <Thalchampz> activate your TANK STANCE
[1:26:22] <fojidoj> PALADIN UNLOCKED
[1:26:22] <%Emperor_Machinus> Lancer draw Aggro!
[1:26:24] <%Ironbuttz> are they integrating mhgen weapon arts aagin?
[1:26:25] <+TenKaiHunter> We need Tomfa back
[1:26:28] <%kyh9> Some of these need to be against a monster
[1:26:30] <%BoxNavy> nope its perfect
[1:26:30] <Profmcstevie> Ol reliable
[1:26:31] <+Jaysky> Lance is good as is
[1:26:32] <%d1stantutopia> AGGRO MECHANIC THO
[1:26:34] <%dekkitout> It needed to pull aggro tho
[1:26:35] <+demon1103> it got a TAUNT
[1:26:36] <penitentpendant> @BoxNavy As long as Behemoth doesn't show up again
[1:26:36] <%Blank9> can you swap weapons in the tent?
[1:26:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> Lance needs nothing
[1:26:38] <+Gespens> Lance from Generations was STUPID
[1:26:39] <Klefth> Lance? More like ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
[1:26:39] <%BoxNavy> thats all it really needed
[1:26:41] <+Jaysky> It's always been super good and reliable
[1:26:42] <%Agami23> its already the best
[1:26:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Lance is legit strong
[1:26:45] <%thetrashman_sc> tonfa is dumb
[1:26:45] <%GinAndRoses> aggro mechanic is nice
[1:26:46] <tetriata> They gave lance an aggro move and a big gap closer. All is good
[1:26:46] <%d1stantutopia> @Blank9 no
[1:26:46] <%miguelrod777> GUN
[1:26:47] <RetributionP> yo a Lange with damage buff
[1:26:47] <delerim001> the purest of weapons
[1:26:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> DA BIG BOI WEAPON TIME
[1:26:51] <%thetrashman_sc> boooooooooooo
[1:26:53] <%Ironbuttz> lance is so fucking powerful
[1:26:53] <+Gespens> Actually, Lance from Generations is WHY Lance should never be given fun tools
[1:26:54] <PanicSwytch> GUNLANCE IS TRUE LANCE
[1:26:55] <%dekkitout> Power of F U N
[1:26:56] <Vyskus> getting a taunt is freaking huge lol
[1:26:56] <%Blank9> awww
[1:26:56] <butthurtdave> I still wish Lance could get some kinda big super damage move, I feel so boring when I use it
[1:26:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> Wu Tang ain't nothin to fuck with
[1:26:58] <DublinRage> so... Offensive Guard, then?
[1:26:59] <%kyh9> This loads really quickly
[1:27:00] <$RealThiele> murica lance
[1:27:00] <%BoxNavy> i hate gunlance ironically despite maining lance
[1:27:01] <%thetrashman_sc> gunlance is for thickies
[1:27:05] <%baka_sugoi> GUN
[1:27:05] <DerpioParty> All you need in a lancing life is poking and guarding
[1:27:05] <%dekkitout> We swing lance or burst bois?
[1:27:06] <nutimik> the "I move slower than a snail" lance
[1:27:08] <SCIENCE_25> I don't get it
[1:27:08] <%ScreamLord> Lance's cooler cousin
[1:27:08] <+RealPT1> guard point and charge sweep are all i could want as a lancer
[1:27:10] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> lance is the epitome of i don't wanna play a wanna win
[1:27:16] <%FacetiousAF> reminder pat when you're firing off the wyvern blast YOU'RE BLOCKING THE WHOLE TIME NOW
[1:27:17] <cherrycottontail> people who don't know that lance is fun don't know how to play lance
[1:27:20] <%CzeekyPlays> Fuck, that is cool
[1:27:21] <+Edrem> wyvern fire can be aimed!
[1:27:23] <pilllowofbees> 6 SHELLS
[1:27:23] <astral_chains> Outsold world with ease
[1:27:23] <%miguelrod777> I'm sorry I can't hear you over tanking everything a monster can throw my way
[1:27:26] <rufus2k2> gunlance is the coolest
[1:27:27] <RetributionP> that's slower I think
[1:27:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> Lance - The Cooler Lance
[1:27:30] <%AlteisenReiseZ> You can charge shots!
[1:27:30] <butthurtdave> WAIT LOOK AT THE SHARPNESS BAR
[1:27:31] <%Blank9> You can zoom the camera out by going into display settings and going to the bottom setting.
[1:27:35] <%BoxNavy> @cherrycottontail see you get it
[1:27:35] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA WYRMSTAKE
[1:27:41] <+BubbaRands> Poke poke slam B O O M
[1:27:45] <+AWr00tBear> Gunlance doesn’t have all of its moves in this beta
[1:27:46] <butthurtdave> IT'S AN ACTUAL METER, NOT AN ESTIMATE
[1:27:52] <EASrake> RELOADING What is this Cod?
[1:27:53] <RetributionP> the deploy is slower I think
[1:27:54] <SCIENCE_25> Wyvern fire?
[1:27:56] <%Deft_Thought> Once I learned about Guard Points and started to get comfortable with the Charge Blade, I had this weird sense that I discovered a layer of complexity I didn't think Monster Hunter had
[1:27:57] <+AWr00tBear> No Blast Dash yet.
[1:28:00] <%AllenDeadman> THAT WAS SICK
[1:28:02] <%kyh9> YOU CAN POP OFF AT THE END
[1:28:02] <+gitgouda> any cool new armor skills that you have seen?
[1:28:03] <%baka_sugoi> woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK
[1:28:05] <%dekkitout> Can that go into a full burst?
[1:28:06] <%BoxNavy> you can do a full burst out of that @PatStaresAt
[1:28:06] <+Edrem> wyvern fire can be aimed while charging!
[1:28:08] <%thetrashman_sc> @butthurtdave its been that way since world tho
[1:28:12] <%kyh9> YOU CAN UNLOAD AT THE END WHEN YOU HIT THE GROUND
[1:28:18] <PanicSwytch> Can u shell when u land?
[1:28:20] <josemoya95> you can full burst after that
[1:28:25] <%Deft_Thought> I also got a little mad that my default SnS wasn't nearly as nuanced
[1:28:29] <%Ironbuttz> MH just gets better and better
[1:28:29] <%d1stantutopia> Wide shelling stuns!?
[1:28:33] <%d1stantutopia> Is that new?
[1:28:37] <PanicSwytch> U can full burst!!!
[1:28:40] <%baka_sugoi> BANG BANG
[1:28:54] <%Blank9> charged shell wide shots too good
[1:28:54] <rufus2k2> metal slug voice *SHAWT GUN*
[1:28:59] <+AWr00tBear> You can propel yourself by shelling in the air.
[1:29:00] <%AlteisenReiseZ> PAT YOU CAN EMPTY THE CLIP AFTER HAIL CUTTER
[1:29:04] <%AllenDeadman> combo still there
[1:29:04] <%d1stantutopia> Pat is there quick reload?
[1:29:05] <%crimsonharvest> do these things still absolutely shred their own durability?
[1:29:08] <+Edrem> you don't need to miss wyvern fire now with aiming LUL
[1:29:09] <%Deft_Thought> Oh, no slinger so no big loading up with slinger boom booms
[1:29:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @rufus2k2 Rock it lawn chair

[1:30:26] <%FacetiousAF> @TheWinged7 he got a code, it helped me to stay on the Rise eshop page a few minutes. maybe i just got lucky with my third or fourth try, idk

[1:33:27] <pokefan9956> what are the chances that this game has mhgu level of monsters
[1:33:29] <%YakumoYomi> Do the quest usages go down when you leave a quest without completing it?

[1:34:46] <KeiPrime> Khezu has the best theme
[1:34:46] <chocobodundee> Khezu is like the only thing that ive liked seeing in rise :D
[1:34:47] <+Jaysky> As for insect glaive, I love it but it seems completely shafted in this game
[1:34:54] <%TheWinged7> @korrag_4 ahh ok, i guess they are going off US release even though im in aus and its past release
[1:34:55] <%Jaxz7> Jaxz7 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:34:55] <GoldenGod0> It has dark shading over the eyes
[1:34:57] <+BubbaRands> Khezu gives me nightmares...
[1:34:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> mine hasn't started even though I hate Download Demo twice and it said it was downloading
[1:34:59] <%wibbwobbler> shweet

[1:35:00] <@StridentSong> YEA INSECT GLAIVE
[1:35:00] <%Jaxnos> can't demonstrate fully without gettin bug juice
[1:35:05] <+Slice_of_Kris> better game than world?
[1:35:06] <T_Sasquatch> Eva*
[1:35:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> Why do you look like a rooster with a nife
[1:35:14] <+demon1103> @Klefth There are no mistakes...just happy little abominations
[1:35:19] <56Bagels> IG is completely unchanged
[1:35:19] <+Gespens> Gigginox > Khezu
[1:35:25] <+BubbaRands> Khezu and Gigginox are RE monsters
[1:35:28] <+Jaysky> You can jump around further and that's about it
[1:35:31] <chocobodundee> you need red buff to do real combos if its anything like old glaives
[1:35:39] <%dekkitout> And bug stick is bug stick
[1:35:44] <%ScreamLord> Pointless?
[1:35:44] <valriot> LUL
[1:35:47] <Daxalog> "Whats the point"
[1:35:47] <%Blank9> they gimped it so much
[1:35:47] <%crimsonharvest> bug more stronk?
[1:35:48] <tetriata> I want my coffin HH
[1:35:48] <%kyh9> Not nearly as creative
[1:35:51] <pilllowofbees> @PatStaresAt one is a areal reset the other is a i-frame evade
[1:35:52] <Thalchampz> because IG is too good as is
[1:35:52] <%wibbwobbler> nope lol
[1:35:55] <%kyh9> DIE INSECT GLAIVE
[1:35:56] <%Monkeyweed21> it lost moves from Iceborne @PatStaresAt
[1:35:57] <%Blank9> the kinsect recall costs a wirebug
[1:35:59] <+Jaysky> Yep
[1:36:02] <%BoxNavy> the coolest move they added to iceborne is tied to a wirebug usage now i believe
[1:36:02] <DraxTD> Altier?
[1:36:03] <%Blank9> it used to be free
[1:36:03] <+superblar> @ShinobiPhoenix Mine did the same thing. I put it to sleep, and woke it up 30 minutes later, and it had installed. For some reason it's not adding the download to the home screen
[1:36:05] <%Emperor_Machinus> Charge Blade!
[1:36:06] <EASrake> we'll need to see the other silk bind moves
[1:36:06] <pokefan9956> every weapon is insect glaive now
[1:36:08] <bubbli97> KInsect got fucking shafted coxThump
[1:36:08] <marklarphd> They already loaded up IG in world
[1:36:10] <%Broand> Charge blade?
[1:36:11] <%BoxNavy> shoot
[1:36:12] <fojidoj> I don’t think it needed much tbh
[1:36:13] <Saltmeisterr> These guns
[1:36:14] <nutimik> did Pat skip Chargeblade?
[1:36:18] <56Bagels> but there's no more normal mounting so they can make IG aerial attacks... better?
[1:36:18] <%Konquerer> guns?
[1:36:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> the guns need a phd just to shoot
[1:36:21] <%d1stantutopia> point and shoot
[1:36:21] <%TrafficCohen> CB?
[1:36:21] <delerim001> you shoot
[1:36:25] <marklarphd> You point and shott
[1:36:26] <Psyramics> you point gun and you shoot
[1:36:27] <%miguelrod777> small brain pat

[1:36:31] <%YakumoYomi> Just point and shoot
[1:36:31] <PE4X> pew pew
[1:36:32] <%Blank9> LBG sets mines that explode repeatedly everytime you hit them, it's like the Mystic Knight in Dragon's Dogma
[1:36:33] <%Monkeyweed21> it lost the plunging and grappling attacks from Iceborne
[1:36:34] <%baka_sugoi> point n shoot
[1:36:34] <%d1stantutopia> @PatStaresAt you skipped Charge Blade lol
[1:36:37] <josemoya95> what move did it loos from world, acording to you?
[1:36:37] <%TheWinged7> triggers
[1:36:40] <PanicSwytch> Aim and Shoot
[1:36:40] <%crimsonharvest> with the guns you spend most of your time agonizing the chart of what ammos they can shoot
[1:36:41] <marklarphd> Guns are all about selecting the right ammo type
[1:36:41] <Psyramics> can you craft in mission
[1:36:42] <%Emperor_Machinus> No... charge blade...
[1:36:46] <pokefan9956> I miss the days of mhtri and medium bowgun
[1:36:46] <penitentpendant> The mysterious power of GUN
[1:36:46] <OneThousandTomatoes> ig has things other than jumping
[1:36:47] <Dave_VD> IG users are stinky anyways

[1:36:57] <TheNewJapanGuy> Why even bother
[1:37:00] <+Minorou> wow that sounds powerful
[1:37:02] <ARDM112> The fuck is this M14 looking motherfucker
[1:37:02] <%codedoomboy> Did he skip charge blade?
[1:37:02] <%dekkitout> They could atleast make aerial attacks do more damage in air with full extract psaSkelmo
[1:37:05] <%Blank9> LBG is mystic knight from Dragon's Dogma, pat
[1:37:07] <pilllowofbees> @bubbli97 not true, your not seeing everything, the two silk moves are not its only ones

[1:47:40] <+bugz_munny> besides having a shield?
[1:47:43] <%dekkitout> We had them- they were behind guardpoints and shield/phial conversion

[1:54:26] <SCIENCE_25> Dog got some real moves.
[1:54:28] <$Afterman_> @ChestMimik unlikely. I havent been able to at least. his tail is how he mainly attacks so i dont think they would deprive him of it
[1:54:28] <%TrafficCohen> You can pick up a third Wirebug Pat
[1:54:32] <ancrest_tant> Dog is doing some SSS combos
[1:54:32] <+Over_ninek> Ninja doge lytKILLGOKU

[1:54:36] <EternalJedi> limesD PALAMUTE IS JUST REPEDE FROM TALES OF VESPERIA
[1:54:37] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> I did not think the dog would have attacks like that, wow.
[1:54:40] <+terry_quest> jobber monster
[1:54:40] <%YakumoYomi> Can you not shoulder tackle through attacks anymore?
[1:54:41] <%Deft_Thought> @rufus2k2 Fair. Ammy would be good
[1:54:42] <redrins> its the baby mission
[1:54:42] <%FacetiousAF> pat you're 2 stronk
[1:54:48] <rufus2k2> dog reminds me more o the tales of Vesperia pipdog
[1:54:48] <%thetrashman_sc> hes a dumb bitch coward
[1:54:51] <rufus2k2> pipedog
[1:54:52] <%BoxNavy> @YakumoYomi you can
[1:54:54] <%Monkeyweed21> why is the game so quiet?
[1:54:54] <s1rcuit> @EternalJedi I thought that earlier
[1:54:56] <+kubozuka27> The dog is literally using Amy’s rosary beads
[1:54:57] <%ScreamLord> Demo Difficulty
[1:54:57] <SCIENCE_25> Giddy up DOG
[1:55:05] <$Afterman_> this monster dies super fast even with things like S&S or DB
[1:55:09] <%d1stantutopia> YO
[1:55:13] <EASrake> you're way over geared for this monster in the demo assuredly
[1:55:13] <goblinpuppy> demo monsters have less health don't they?
[1:55:13] <josemoya95> well you are wearing rajang equivalent armor, or don't know how that works on the demo
[1:55:20] <$Afterman_> dogs fight so damn cool
[1:55:22] <%ChestMimik> Even for the demo he's kind of a bitch
[1:55:24] <artificiallynatural> jeez the dog downed all three of them
[1:55:25] <+TheShisno> So Pat, how hot is your Switch right now?
[1:55:26] <TrollKing96> Did they take out sliding?
[1:55:27] <$StrawberryPantsu> Whiff
[1:55:39] <PanicSwytch> The music is so good
[1:55:44] <$Afterman_> @TrollKing96 no there is sliding
[1:55:48] <+kubozuka27> This monster,while intimidating looking is still just the first bird wyvern jobber
[1:55:49] <%TrafficCohen> Get fucked Jaggi
[1:55:49] <%BoxNavy> sliding is still in but there are less slopes it looks like
[1:55:50] <+Gespens> I feel the problem with the Silkbind move for GS might only be a problem for monsters of this size, as opposed to things like Mizutsune, or Rath
[1:55:51] <%baka_sugoi> GOT
[1:55:52] <%Treuan> nice
[1:55:52] <rufus2k2> BONKED
[1:55:55] <%Jaxnos> doggo with the killshot
[1:56:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> i think the mhw and mhw:i demos were easier than the game released
[1:56:17] <EASrake> Dog carried you
[1:56:19] <%BoxNavy> im excited to see the harder monsters
[1:56:26] <%d1stantutopia> Bigger monsters will be much easier to hit with that silkbind I think
[1:56:27] <%Monkeyweed21> the big jump attack can be charged @PatStaresAt
[1:56:28] <pokefan9956> yeah. silkbind seems like it'd be easier the bigger the monster
[1:56:34] <%BoxNavy> greatsword :)
[1:56:34] <%NopeBadguy> it's like lion's maw and absolute readiness together
[1:56:34] <$spardanwarrior> Ice Bear
[1:56:35] <s1rcuit> idk 'bout you guys, but getting hit in the face several times by a giant sword sure would knock the wind out of my sails
[1:56:36] <+teh_rawk> ammy still the best
[1:56:38] <+Gespens> Blast Element?
[1:56:38] <diontmack> goss harag greatsword

[1:56:43] <+EySoyCoco> it really does run great holy co
[1:56:44] <TypoTemp> duude, this game looks so sick
[1:56:45] <+paladinstarbuster> at least carve him dont disrespect the monster
[1:56:50] <%Blank9> when you bounce
[1:56:51] <nutimik> probably just blast
[1:56:52] <BlueSpartan119> ice GS
[1:56:54] <%TrafficCohen> There's 4 monsters in this demo
[1:56:54] <josemoya95> goss harag ice sword
[1:56:56] <%kyh9> Sheath, get airborn, and then attack
[1:56:57] <%d1stantutopia> Yo that set looks really cool damn
[1:56:57] <$Afterman_> also @PatStaresAt if you DELETE YOUR SAVES you can restore your 30 quest hunt limit
[1:57:00] <jmft2000> Its from the new monster
[1:57:04] <rufus2k2> such a neat win screen
[1:57:06] <%croxeye> It's hard to believe this is a switch game
[1:57:07] <Chaoko99> can you rotate your sword slash

[2:02:47] <%ChestMimik> YEAH HE IS
[2:02:47] <$Afterman_> yep
[2:02:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt wait...? I just noticed Pat's title says "Sponsored". Is Capcom actually sponsoring this? did they provide a pre-order to Pat "love Monster Hunter" Bolvin?
[2:02:49] <$Afterman_> he cant move
[2:02:52] <%YakumoYomi> I really hope they bring the Wirebug forward
[2:02:53] <%kyh9> YEs
[2:02:53] <jon651> was that three flinch shots?
[2:02:54] <%d1stantutopia> YEAH HE IS
[2:02:55] <boogaleeboo> Yeah you've messed his shit up for real
[2:02:57] <EASrake> it seems so
[2:03:01] <%ChestMimik> WYVERNBLAST GO BRR
[2:03:02] <+teh_rawk> they made you super powerful in this one'
[2:03:02] <josemoya95> het wrecked lol
[2:03:05] <%kyh9> You can tell how much longer by how many wires are attached
[2:03:06] <EASrake> at least partially
[2:03:06] <%dekkitout> Can't wait to see how ineffectual that is on ED's
[2:03:07] <ancrest_tant> Big D A M A G E
[2:03:13] <%SirGO0SE> the wires were disappearing tho
[2:03:14] <Chaoko99> is wirefall just a fucking ukemi
[2:03:15] <$Afterman_> @ShinobiPhoenix they have pat a media demo
[2:03:16] <%spitelite> seems like a good time for that jumping attack
[2:03:17] <%d1stantutopia> Oh, and he's snapping the wires one by one
[2:03:19] <Chaoko99> in MONSTER HUNTER
[2:03:20] <%ChestMimik> Do you think that'll replace capture nets?
[2:03:25] <+terry_quest> is there a follow up to the leap?
[2:03:26] <$Afterman_> gave*
[2:03:35] <$spardanwarrior> Oh hey, actual item descriptions
[2:03:42] <+PrincessLuna85> i cant get the demo to download :(
[2:03:42] <%damienlunas> damienlunas subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 14 month streak! What weapons did you use most in World, and what weapons do you think you'll use in Rise now that you've had a chance to play around?
[2:03:43] <+bugz_munny> I like that swing
[2:03:57] <%ChestMimik> I think it JUST started depleting
[2:04:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but the demo is up for us all now, right? at least the store says the demo is up
[2:04:04] <Psyramics> no, that's your stamina cap
[2:04:06] <%isolex_> DUDE THIS IS THE SICKEST
[2:04:12] <$Afterman_> @ShinobiPhoenix yes its live for all
[2:04:15] <+terry_quest> yea demo is out
[2:04:17] <artificiallynatural> demo is up and playable on the store now
[2:04:18] <%d1stantutopia> psaBig damage
[2:04:20] <%Treuan> 355
[2:04:21] <+teh_rawk> does the hunter talk now?
[2:04:23] <boogaleeboo> I was shocked this really does just seem to be "Better world"
[2:04:26] <+PrincessLuna85> store has an option to download the demo but when i click it it wont download for me
[2:04:30] <Chaoko99> BIG NUMBER
[2:04:31] <%YakumoYomi> Pat got a special "Media" demo. Not sure how it differs.
[2:04:32] <$Afterman_> @teh_rawk yes
[2:04:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> i like all the new monster potraits that look like they were drawn with a brush
[2:04:35] <%Deft_Thought> What>
[2:04:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> though I admit the demo isn't downloading for me either, I thought it was because I was streaming and testing PS Now
[2:04:42] <$Afterman_> @PrincessLuna85 nintendo servers are slammed atm
[2:04:43] <artificiallynatural> though lots of people are downloading it so it's kinda not working at the moment
[2:04:51] <%Deft_Thought> Very Much Big Useful For Much Monstar psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:04:53] <%kyh9> Demo build
[2:04:56] <josemoya95> Hey people after seeing Pat whiff the airial attack so much you still belive the insect glave is now pointless?
[2:04:59] <%Monkeyweed21> demo gear
[2:05:01] <+bugz_munny> demoooooo
[2:05:04] <Saltmeisterr> Probably just for the demo
[2:05:07] <$Afterman_> man the dog is so fun to control
[2:05:10] <butthurtdave> My big question is how is charms/decorations going to work
[2:05:16] <+PrincessLuna85> @Afterman_ im sure but i have to leave for my graveyard shift in like 10min and i cant get it to download
[2:05:19] <+dante_must_die_exe> oh no
[2:05:22] <+PrincessLuna85> so im going to whine
[2:05:25] <%AllenDeadman> LUL
[2:05:25] <EASrake> its true
[2:05:27] <jon651> Pat you are the master of MH
[2:05:29] <+terry_quest> its not pointless its just nothing new to it
[2:05:30] <goblinpuppy> I'm not
[2:05:34] <artificiallynatural> do not discount pat's lack of skill
[2:05:35] <%Monkeyweed21> for such a big fan Pat does suck at MH
[2:05:36] <PanicSwytch> True
[2:05:36] <marklarphd> Is this MH6 or 5.5? Feels like 6
[2:05:37] <%ChestMimik> My method to be good at MonHun is "use a gun"
[2:05:37] <%Blank9> as someone who loved IG in 4 and world, it looks like trash in this
[2:05:37] <leinadtonu> even me?
[2:05:38] <oOZtkOo> Correct Kappa
[2:05:39] <$Afterman_> @PrincessLuna85 if you can just leave ur switch on it may download on its own
[2:05:39] <bubbli97> true
[2:05:39] <Profmcstevie> With a little practice, you'll stop missing
[2:05:39] <%Treuan> what was that pickup?
[2:05:40] <goblinpuppy> I'm terrible
[2:05:40] <koffeemancer> I think if you hit ZR after the jump attack you do a plunging strike @PatStaresAt
[2:05:41] <Siconia> Pat made monster hunter
[2:05:42] <$Afterman_> not sure if it will tho
[2:05:42] <Daxalog> More like Insect Glame. Oh shit
[2:05:45] <convo445> i wanna see doggo climb up walls
[2:05:47] <+kubozuka27> Theres three monsters roaming???
[2:05:48] <ancrest_tant> I’ve never played and I’m somehow better
[2:05:49] <%Blank9> I can't believe they got rid of the powder clouds
[2:05:49] <$Afterman_> i got mine downloaded before the servers got slammed
[2:05:49] <bettysharkface> I dunno I've never played so you're at least better than me
[2:05:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> i managed to hit is constantly after a few tries so
[2:05:52] <%baka_sugoi> i no pla MH tho
[2:05:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I've not played Monster Hunter since Monster Hunter 1. I'm still much better than Pat.
[2:05:57] <jmft2000> Dogs can climb walls
[2:05:58] <%Monkeyweed21> Max is WAY better at MH and he's only played World
[2:05:58] <+bugz_munny> GO GET A FATALIS KILL PAT
[2:05:59] <%SGrim> @marklarphd this is definitely 6
[2:06:02] <+Pyroclase> what
[2:06:03] <%AbnormalVoid> what
[2:06:04] <+HiroTSK5> Great Wire Bugs are big jumps
[2:06:06] <EASrake> Great wirebug? Is that like a permanaent zipline?
[2:06:08] <%Piemono> It's true, I've never played a minute of the game and I'm way better
[2:06:09] <+kralec> True facts from a Canadian.
[2:06:11] <UnfilteredComic> Youre actually doing great, you dodged a ton of this there while attacking
[2:06:16] <%Xevtes> @PatStaresAt is the level smaller than MHW's?
[2:06:17] <leinadtonu> Awesome, I'm good at MH and I don't even play it Kappa
[2:06:23] <%AnIcedCoffee> Bet you didn't even kill Fatalis in World
[2:06:24] <jmft2000> You can run with the dog on walls
[2:06:46] <+bugz_munny> MH gatekeeping is the best i love it
[2:06:53] <EASrake> jeez
[2:06:53] <+Delenay> skyrim that shit

[2:07:02] <%isolex_> This movement is so sick
[2:07:04] <+bugz_munny> BACK IN MY DAY WE USED TO CONTROL OUR ATTACKS WITH THE RIGHT STICK
[2:07:04] <%baka_sugoi> FIGHT
[2:07:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> So I get that the monsters you hunt are like bioweapons that inherited the Earth, are the wire bugs and other bug tools you use in the same point or is it something else?

[2:08:56] <%GalacticaPhanto> Oh this music is so good I legit love it so much
[2:08:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I guess this is why the monster is called Elegant Water.
[2:08:59] <%GinAndRoses> mizu's theme goes

[2:09:28] <%ChestMimik> @Dave_VD Nintendo servers
[2:09:29] <artificiallynatural> also you can blight monsters now
[2:09:30] <%ScreamLord> Fun Fact: All of the Mizutsune you hunt are males. Most of the time Mizus are very passive but during mating season the males become super aggressive
[2:09:36] <%sniffy77> Pat I baked a apple pie and im eating a bowl of it topped with vanilla ice cream.

[2:09:52] <PerfectAsymmetry> Balls exposed on stream
[2:09:53] <EASrake> really got to feel out the spacing
[2:09:56] <%hrbeck_> Stupid twink mitsu
[2:09:59] <%baka_sugoi> short
[2:10:00] <%kyh9> RED BUBBLE BUFFS YOU
[2:10:03] <$Afterman_> @sniffy77 add smuckers hard choclate shell
[2:10:03] <Oxybe> So they nerfed the heck out of IG
[2:10:03] <jon651> sometimes I miss the slinger burst. it was so useful reorienting yourself.
[2:10:17] <Oxybe> Sad times as an IG main
[2:10:25] <+TheAutisticCowboy> Fuck, this game looks great
[2:10:25] <%kyh9> Jumping and attacking does
[2:10:30] <UnfilteredComic> If its blue it does
[2:10:32] <$Afterman_> DBs feel v strong
[2:10:35] <josemoya95> yes it does
[2:10:36] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[2:10:39] <PanicSwytch> I can wait to see how multiplayer is like with 4 hunter and 4 palicos fighting and wyvern riding
[2:10:48] <%BoxNavy> it really is lol
[2:10:49] <%hrbeck_> Ig mains get fucked
[2:10:50] <$HowIPendragon> Holy cow. I cannot wait to play this on the Switch Pro
[2:10:52] <AfternoonConcession> i heard HH got hella buffs and is more user friendly this time around
[2:10:54] <BlueSpartan119> IG is dead
[2:10:58] <%ChestMimik> BREAK HIS FACE
[2:10:58] <%BoxNavy> now ig is just a weird beatstick
[2:10:59] <%YakumoYomi> A slower, harder hitting IG
[2:11:01] <Daxalog> What are the sales targets for this game?
[2:11:01] <nathorz1> music is great
[2:11:02] <%zestyArsenic> theres gotta be more to insect glaive then. like a relaunch or something?
[2:11:04] <%Tearonex> every weapon is now insect glaive LUL
[2:11:06] <%kyh9> RIDE HIM
[2:11:12] <%Agami23> why are some bubbles different colors?
[2:11:18] <oOZtkOo> aww man i was an ig main
[2:11:23] <$Afterman_> @Agami23 some give buffs
[2:11:25] <+buttdirt> music reminds me of nier a bit
[2:11:26] <%Blank9> HH got the most changes for sure, the whole song system is different
[2:11:26] <s1rcuit> I like it's big broomy tail
[2:11:30] <dan_g_v> some are buffs, some heal, others make you faster
[2:11:31] <%Emperor_Machinus> The insect glaive everywhere system
[2:11:34] <RetributionP> yo this sounds like neir autotomatos
[2:11:35] <%kyh9> COUNTERED
[2:11:35] <Saltmeisterr> @Agami23 they give buffs
[2:11:35] <Chaoko99> brushy fox
[2:11:36] <jkfd> @Agami23 red gives attack buff, green heals
[2:11:36] <%dekkitout> With IG you get a sort of reset on your aerial chain with wirebug
[2:11:36] <josemoya95> blue background under damage means wirebug damage
[2:11:36] <%kyh9> ANTI AIR
[2:11:38] <+terry_quest> im more interested how the game performs with 4 hunters and 4 pets
[2:11:44] <%TrafficCohen> MID AIR
[2:11:47] <PanicSwytch> IG is irrelevant now
[2:11:48] <jon651> Pat don't forget wirefall
[2:11:50] <%ChestMimik> Potions seem faster than World
[2:11:50] <dan_g_v> reds are attack boost
[2:11:51] <%SirGO0SE> those are some rad shaders
[2:11:54] <+aWanderingKaivo> insect glaive should be able to wire dash to the kinsect
[2:11:56] <Chaoko99> pat getting styled on
[2:11:58] <%YakumoYomi> IG is still king in the air, I'd imagine
[2:11:58] <dan_g_v> insta gram?
[2:12:01] <marklarphd> This Mizu looks so good
[2:12:01] <+Pyroclase> oooh, buildin damage
[2:12:03] <artificiallynatural> at worst there seems to be some stuttering with 4 hunters and 4 pets
[2:12:05] <DestroyerPhoenix> oh i just noticed the cool arts on the top right lol
[2:12:07] <Oxybe> IG lost the downthrust from Iceborne in the demo. The reset ok, but aerial eats a TON of stamina.
[2:12:07] <%Agami23> interesting
[2:12:07] <boogaleeboo> I still find it insane this is on the switch
[2:12:13] <NewDonkKing> did u play mhgu?
[2:12:14] <shutupyouprick> is he really playing this on the Switch? it looks so nice
[2:12:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> @terry_quest max's 4player 4 pets stream ran without issues
[2:12:31] <%Jaxnos> that sliding attacks is the goofiest fucking thing i love it
[2:12:33] <+kralec> Levolution!! KomodoHype
[2:12:38] <%Jaxnos> the one mizu does
[2:12:43] <+skeletonmilk> Is this Bayonetta 4?
[2:12:47] <%TrafficCohen> Korone
[2:12:50] <%logoth_> You have a crazy taxi arrow now
[2:12:51] <Zombrocom> Sliddy soap fox dragon
[2:12:57] <Oxybe> i'll probably switch to my Iceborne secondary, the hammer for Rise.
[2:12:58] <%Campfire_Chronicles> mizutsune used bubble beam. It's not very effective...
[2:12:59] <%YakumoYomi> I like that the areas appear to be wider and flatter than in World. I really disliked all the steps and slopes
[2:13:01] <%BoxNavy> holy shit i cant wait for people to rip the music from this demo
[2:13:01] <%kyh9> HEAL
[2:13:05] <AfternoonConcession> i hope they bring back gammoth
[2:13:07] <+aWanderingKaivo> no, this is Anor Londo city building sim
[2:13:08] <+mmack093> How well does the game run?
[2:13:12] <%primarch_lupercal> no its dmc6
[2:13:16] <brachydios777> Monster Hunter team is to Capcom what FF14 team is to Square Enix
[2:13:19] <%d1stantutopia> was that a vigorwasp?
[2:13:19] <%sniffy77> why hunt monster
[2:13:24] <ioriac> @TrafficCohen LoL I was just thinking that
[2:13:25] <+Virtual_Rays> MIZUTSUNE'S THEME HAS VOCALS!
[2:13:47] <+Virtual_Rays> @BoxNavy Already uploaded on youtube
[2:13:50] <%Campfire_Chronicles> this theme sounds like some nier shit
[2:13:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> pet the doggo
[2:14:06] <%yeknomlive> they made this theme even better
[2:14:07] <NewDonkKing> i like monster hunter but i cant hurt the cool monsters, especially when they limp any
[2:14:11] <+terry_quest> does anyone else hear barret when the hunter talks?
[2:14:11] <%BoxNavy> @BoxNavy thank you for the heads up :D
[2:14:12] <%ChestMimik> With your face yes
[2:14:15] <%baka_sugoi> bonk
[2:14:16] <NewDonkKing> IT IS TOO MUCH
[2:14:17] <+OpenMikeLive> with your face LUL
[2:14:27] <passionatelust> how's the fps on the switch
[2:14:30] <koffeemancer> can you use a silkbind attack after a true charge slash?
[2:14:43] <jon651> You love those bubbles
[2:14:46] <%dekkitout> Take this, my last hamon bubble!
[2:14:51] <Chaoko99> @passionatelust seems to be good enough so far
[2:14:56] <+skeletonmilk> HE LOVES IT
[2:15:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> memories of copied factory
[2:15:04] <%Jaxnos> you have hit that once
[2:15:05] <%kyh9> He can be mounted
[2:15:14] <Chaoko99> It seems to be getting good frames with the simple but open environments
[2:15:16] <%kyh9> Getting closer
[2:15:18] <%CzeekyPlays> @dekkitout Too soon BibleThump
[2:15:20] <%Jaxnos> oooh, you mean the mount
[2:15:23] <%kyh9> I think
[2:15:24] <brachydios777> FUCKING BUBBLES!
[2:15:26] <$Order_of_Mystery> you mounted rathion earlier, and he was just as big
[2:15:36] <%AllenDeadman> he can DRIFT?
[2:15:37] <%ChestMimik> I think it's gonna be one of those things where some wepaons are better at wirebugging certain monsters
[2:15:39] <%d1stantutopia> I don't think you can if they're enraged? I have no evidence but that's what I'd assume
[2:15:41] <%CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt Just popped in. How you liking it so far?
[2:15:41] <Chaoko99> @dekkitout IT'S BEEN 20 YEARS
[2:15:50] <DublinRage> Mizutsune is a Leviathan not an Elder Dragon, so can he be captured?
[2:15:53] <GoldenGod0> Your not landing enought skillbind attacks
[2:15:56] <%Blank9> oh yeah turf wars let you ride
[2:15:57] <%kyh9> LAUNCH
[2:15:59] <%TrafficCohen> POKEMON BATTLE
[2:16:01] <%kyh9> LAUNCH TO SWITCH MONSTER
[2:16:03] <PanicSwytch> KAIJU BATTLE
[2:16:03] <%CzeekyPlays> STILL TOO SOON
[2:16:10] <lets_be_friendos> PogChamp
[2:16:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> I believe wben the damage number had a blue bit around it it is working towards mount
[2:16:17] <s1rcuit> doggo's good and all, but what about BIG DOGGO?
[2:16:18] <$Order_of_Mystery> hunting monsters... with another monster. now that's a big-brain move right there
[2:16:23] <boogaleeboo> Yeah this game is rad as hell
[2:16:25] <%ChestMimik> I noticed that Mizu is sticking around in one area a lot longer than I would have expected
[2:16:27] <+dante_must_die_exe> LUL
[2:16:27] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[2:16:30] <jon651> Lol
[2:16:33] <%GinAndRoses> only the most stylish of whiffs
[2:16:33] <valriot> I just realised mounting is optional now, which means people in multilayer won't flashbomb, and its likely more effective to leave them in a stunned state longer to set up traps
[2:16:38] <%dekkitout> I wonder if certain wired monsters will be able to apply bug status with attacks
[2:16:42] <EASrake> imagine makeing a tier 5 bird wyvern beat the crap out of a tier 2 Leviathan
[2:16:42] <%hrbeck_> More like Monster Hunter: Ride
[2:16:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> it looked cool though
[2:16:44] <Chaoko99> N I CE
[2:16:58] <nathorz1> ride on
[2:17:00] <%Jaxnos> pat has figured out the spacing perfectly, don't be fooled. it takes precision to jump the exact space over the monster so often.
[2:17:03] <%yeknomlive> demo wont download for me. do i just has to keep spamming it?
[2:17:04] <%kyh9> There's some amount of meter that needs to build up its invisible
[2:17:12] <%kyh9> HOLY FUCK
[2:17:14] <lets_be_friendos> monkaS
[2:17:16] <%Monkeyweed21> its just mounting damage with a new name
[2:17:17] <%Blank9> there's a good chance GS might just not be the best aerial attacker
[2:17:20] <%kyh9> GRAB RATHIAN
[2:17:20] <s1rcuit> was wondering where she went
[2:17:23] <$Order_of_Mystery> rathion is back! :D
[2:17:29] <pokefan9956> Rathian outta nowhere
[2:17:31] <Chaoko99> RATHIANNNN
[2:17:34] <%AbnormalVoid> Surf n Turf War
[2:17:37] <%YakumoYomi> This looks great. I really hope the leak was true and we get a PC version (for higher frame rates)
[2:17:38] <%AllenDeadman> bye rathian
[2:17:39] <+terry_quest> nope rathina aint having none of that
[2:17:42] <+mmack093> This game looks nice and seems to run well on Swith, what black magic is capcom using?
[2:17:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> the clward ran away
[2:17:53] <%dekkitout> It is a demo
[2:17:53] <%kyh9> The green bubbles heal
[2:17:59] <%TrafficCohen> @mmack093 The RE engine is great
[2:18:00] <DraxTD> Pat promotes gang violence
[2:18:02] <boogaleeboo> RE engine is insane
[2:18:06] <%Monkeyweed21> demo is easy mode pat
[2:18:06] <PanicSwytch> @yeknomlive it takes time to download. the server is overloaded with ppl downloading the demo
[2:18:07] <darkdagon769> the magic of the RE engine
[2:18:08] <Psyramics> what armor skills did you get?
[2:18:08] <UnfilteredComic> Sets might have stun res gemmed in lmao
[2:18:09] <valriot> People are assuming stun might be just straight up gone
[2:18:09] <artificiallynatural> what do the red bubbles do?
[2:18:11] <%d1stantutopia> Maybe the armour set has stun resistance?
[2:18:20] <%Jaxnos> mmm
[2:18:21] <%Treuan> f
[2:18:21] <%ChestMimik> "They made this easier"
[2:18:22] <%baka_sugoi> RIP
[2:18:23] <+bugz_munny> oof
[2:18:24] <%TrafficCohen> F
[2:18:25] <s1rcuit> @mmack093 it's called "efficient coding" it's a dying art
[2:18:26] <Daxalog> He carted!
[2:18:26] <Chaoko99> @mmack093 seems to be doing a lot with global illumination and relatively simple environment details. Gotta remember that the series mostly is area based as a concession for the PSP
[2:18:28] <%AbnormalVoid> rekt
[2:18:31] <%GinAndRoses> cart bois
[2:18:31] <%CzeekyPlays> Thankfully capcom is utilizing their engine, unlike FOX
[2:18:31] <josemoya95> Max was saying he dind0t as well in couople of hours he had played, maybe its out
[2:18:32] <%YakumoYomi> Maybe it's back to pre-World stun rules (where it had to be two hits in quick succession)?
[2:18:32] <pokefan9956> @artificiallynatural gives you a tshirt
[2:18:33] <delerim001> "easier"
[2:18:34] <Chaoko99> F
[2:18:35] <+blaze__drag> crazy talk activates?
[2:18:35] <Daxalog> He Cart we kick
[2:18:39] <NewDonkKing> red bubbles give damage buff
[2:18:40] <+chkrailtracer> Oh damn is this seriously on the switch?
[2:18:40] <goblinpuppy> I legit don't know how GS users do good damage without knowing a monster's moveset by heart, they take so long to hit
[2:18:41] <her0_89> i dont think the armor has stun resist. I have yet to get stunned and I get hit a lot so far
[2:18:44] <+terry_quest> so there seems to be an article going around with the rumor beeing they cant announce the pc version until 6 months after the switch release
[2:18:45] <%Jaxnos> was that like 70% health there?
[2:18:48] <+xenoboost> good ole crazy talk
[2:18:48] <RetributionP> haha
[2:18:49] <ioriac> crazy talk
[2:18:58] <convo445> can't wait for MT framework to be completly dead and buried in the next year or so
[2:19:03] <+Kenzo2000> just times out trying to get all three monsters in intermediate in one go
[2:19:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> mh demos are usually easy/easier than the game
[2:19:17] <+terry_quest> @goblinpuppy thats the whole thing about monster hunter learning attack patterns etc
[2:19:32] <her0_89> running out of potions.
[2:19:39] <pokefan9956> antidote
[2:19:44] <AfternoonConcession> huh, they changed the look of antidote
[2:19:44] <%kyh9> go to your tent then
[2:19:44] <valriot> Demos are actually usually harder than the base game
[2:19:54] <%TrafficCohen> @PatStaresAt Potions in the tent
[2:19:55] <+Virtual_Rays> @PatStaresAt You can get more potions back in the camp tent
[2:19:57] <%mikessdd> Didn’t the world demo crank Nergigante up? They’re not usually easier.
[2:20:05] <+bugz_munny> OVER A TAIL SPIN
[2:20:08] <+bugz_munny> THATS GROSS
[2:20:12] <%kyh9> If it has the blue background on the damage number, I think that means its adding to the mount stun
[2:20:14] <%Monkeyweed21> its amazing how bad Pat is at MH despite how many he's played
[2:20:16] <jon651> I know I'm looking way ahead. But I honestly can't wait to see the new MH on PS5/XSX/PC it's going to look amazing
[2:20:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Bravely Default's original demos were definitely way harder than the real game
[2:20:24] <%d1stantutopia> This music though!
[2:20:24] <+cowkid222> he into it chat?
[2:20:36] <jon651> if Rise looks this good on switch
[2:20:42] <RetributionP> are you telling me hit boxes arnt extremely bored this time around?
[2:20:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> to the point they completely put me off the game, at least until playing the Bravely Default II demo
[2:20:46] <PanicSwytch> The music is so much better
[2:20:49] <her0_89> lol pat aint bad, he is trying out new mechanics that he has never used before...
[2:20:51] <RetributionP> borked
[2:20:59] <AfternoonConcession> is it easier to deal with flying monsters now?
[2:21:01] <artificiallynatural> do the hunters call out the big attacks now? that's pretty handy
[2:21:04] <MattoBii> dumbass flew into a rock
[2:21:21] <jon651> Look at this flying wyvern run away
[2:21:21] <SCIENCE_25> "Mechanics he's never used before.
[2:21:22] <%d1stantutopia> "LATER NERD"
[2:21:25] <+OpenMikeLive> look at the dumb flying dragon running away
[2:21:26] <SCIENCE_25> He's using GS.
[2:21:26] <%ChestMimik> DEJA VU
[2:21:27] <Chaoko99> dunno but it may be demo related
[2:21:28] <+Over_ninek> GAS GAS GAS
[2:21:32] <+Pyroclase> So how long until you try and call your MH doggo and Zangief comes over
[2:21:36] <rubbersnake21> the paintballs back?
[2:21:38] <%mikessdd> I noticed my hunter doing call outs before Rathian somersaults
[2:21:41] <%AnIcedCoffee> WHIFF
[2:21:42] <AfternoonConcession> nice
[2:21:44] <Sunstalker> Eat shit LUL
[2:21:48] <her0_89> And hes using a lot of the wire bug attacks even when they arent always good to use
[2:21:52] <%Monkeyweed21> new mechanics like not taking Rathian's tail spin over and over
[2:21:53] <%WhereIsWill> nice
[2:21:54] <ioriac> DO you like my dog!?
[2:21:58] <%ChestMimik> That Rathian turned into your swing
[2:21:59] <%Grimlockfly> holy shit, just watching this, i'm back in on Monster hunter
[2:22:01] <her0_89> let pat learn how they work
[2:22:04] <PanicSwytch> Pat is the whiff pro
[2:22:21] <DestroyerPhoenix> the hunter is saying stuff like "be careful" before big attacks like the flip
[2:22:30] <%mikessdd> He hit it yeahhhhh
[2:22:40] <%Deft_Thought> I've always loved the stylized monster caricatures that they use in the Monster Guide book
[2:22:40] <%Treuan> jebaited
[2:22:48] <%Deft_Thought> It's neat to see the ones in the upper right
[2:22:50] <dan_g_v> pro player shows the basics
[2:22:55] <%BoxNavy> is anyone having trouble downloading the demo? im trying to get it on my other switch but it wont download. worked fine on my switch lite monkaS
[2:23:05] <dan_g_v> now show us how to miss the true charge
[2:23:15] <%ChestMimik> @BoxNavy Servers are probably overwhelmed
[2:23:15] <%Jaxnos> oh wow, i didn't think they'd use the callouts as warnings. that's actually really nice
[2:23:16] <her0_89> servers are slow to download the demo
[2:23:21] <%kyh9> Explosive tops?
[2:23:23] <%Deft_Thought> I wasn't super excited for this at first because I didn't like that Monster Hunter was going back to being a Switch exclusive
[2:23:23] <her0_89> Took me like 10 minutes before it started downloading.
[2:23:27] <%Deft_Thought> But I'm glad it looks fun
[2:23:27] <AfternoonConcession> nice
[2:23:28] <Sunstalker> It's a beyblade KomodoHype
[2:23:29] <Profmcstevie> Flaming beyblades HahaCat
[2:23:29] <Mangahero18> boomerang cat
[2:23:33] <%AbnormalVoid> Imagine actually hitting the target
[2:23:34] <%ScreamLord> Dreidel Bombs
[2:23:34] <Bryon_Youngblood> So, how's Pat been doing?
[2:23:35] <+cowkid222> shooting pure love
[2:23:38] <%mikessdd> When you click the download button and it’s grayed out. Try waiting a bit before going back to home. Then wait some more. Don’t touch it.
[2:23:45] <+terry_quest> i would imagine there is a shit ton of people wanting the demo
[2:23:45] <%AbnormalVoid> this meme was created by the hammer gang
[2:23:50] <Bryon_Youngblood> You can do it, Pat
[2:23:53] <%mikessdd> Took mine awhile.
[2:23:55] <%YakumoYomi> I was able to download it fine. Maybe servers are slammed?
[2:23:59] <MattoBii> go back to the tent and get more potions?
[2:24:04] <%Monkeyweed21> @her0_89 oh I'm not talking about whiffing the new moves thats normal I just mean that pat isnt very good at fighting this monster he's been fighting for over half a decade with a weapon he mains in a demo that is much easier than the main game. Iz funny
[2:24:09] <%ChestMimik> @Bryon_Youngblood Fairly decent ignorning missing the wirebug misses
[2:24:17] <valriot> I'm glad Crit Draw is gonna be way more viable in this than World
[2:24:21] <PanicSwytch> Servers are overloaded. Takes a while for the demo to download
[2:24:22] <Bryon_Youngblood> After this encounter, I think Pat will need to really restock.
[2:24:27] <%preeeow> God, they moved allll the IG buttons around
[2:24:35] <%d1stantutopia> SICK
[2:24:36] <%Monkeyweed21> nice
[2:24:40] <rosemon5001> this looks like a diseased rat
[2:24:40] <%Jaxnos> bunch of hammer bros as myself are unga bunga'ing the servers
[2:24:42] <%mikessdd> I feel like most people in here could fight Rathian in their sleep. Probably have.
[2:24:43] <%Jaxnos> you must wait
[2:24:46] <%WhereIsWill> solid hits pat
[2:24:47] <%Monkeyweed21> good tackle
[2:24:47] <artificiallynatural> damn busted her face during her roar
[2:24:47] <her0_89> pat dont need potions. He can totes do this.
[2:24:47] <+aidan_starmanjr> howdy yall!
[2:24:48] <Chaoko99> YOOOO
[2:24:51] <%YakumoYomi> What's that effect coming off Rathian?
[2:24:54] <%BoxNavy> oh also someone in chat earlier said deleting your save resets the 30 quest counter and that totally works
[2:24:54] <Evendrag> yo gang, is it faster or slower then world?
[2:24:57] <+aidan_starmanjr> how's the frame rate? curious how switch handels the RE engine
[2:24:58] <fojidoj> @valriot Crit Draw is super viable in world
[2:25:00] <josemoya95> You can do a differet airial hit after the wirebug attack, a plungging one, don't know the imput thou
[2:25:01] <MattoBii> really not gonna restock on potions, huh
[2:25:01] <Bryon_Youngblood> Great, I'm getting flashbacks to that Tarkus chant from Dark Souls when Pat said he wants to throw Rathian into a wall.
[2:25:02] <%ChestMimik> NAILED IT

[2:25:13] <%ScreamLord> CLIP IT
[2:25:14] <%BoxNavy> PAT YOU DID A COOL
[2:25:15] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpSetIn
[2:25:17] <pokefan9956> sick
[2:25:19] <+terry_quest> so how does this play with joy cons?(dont own a switch can only borrow it)
[2:25:19] <Chaoko99> yoooo
[2:25:23] <%Monkeyweed21> oh cool this fight is won now
[2:25:23] <+KingDewey> CART
[2:25:25] <Bryon_Youngblood> Somebody better clip it :D
[2:25:27] <%AnIcedCoffee> CARTED
[2:25:29] <%WhereIsWill> F
[2:25:29] <%Jaxnos> powerful
[2:25:30] <jon651> What? Poison with no tail?
[2:25:32] <%GinAndRoses> it was cool tho
[2:25:32] <%kyh9> GOOD QUEST
[2:25:33] <artificiallynatural> frames are a very consistent 30 fps. very few drops even in 4 player 4 dogs
[2:25:33] <%Emperor_Machinus> So cool he died
[2:25:34] <%NKOrange> but at least he did a cool before
[2:25:34] <her0_89> Whelp...I may have crazy talked the crazy talk man
[2:25:35] <%isolex_> F
[2:25:35] <koffeemancer> but how poison?
[2:25:36] <Bryon_Youngblood> LUL! WOW!
[2:25:36] <%Blank9> CLIP IT
[2:25:38] <%YakumoYomi> psaSmug
[2:25:39] <+Virtual_Rays> Go into the tent
[2:25:40] <%ScreamLord> Wait, she STILL poisoned you?
[2:25:41] <CursedNobleman> EASY MODE IS NOW SELECTABLE
[2:25:43] <+Kenidashi> lol "Well that sucked"
[2:25:44] <+bugz_munny> WELL THAT SUCKED
[2:25:46] <%ChestMimik> @terry_quest Not bad, but I'll probably stick to a pro controller when docked
[2:25:47] <%h0tapplecider> you can use items mid air when you use your wirebug
[2:25:47] <%Monkeyweed21> @jon651 the nails are poison too
[2:25:48] <pokefan9956> he's always been able to poison without tail?
[2:25:48] <Zombrocom> Well that sucked
[2:25:51] <%Emperor_Machinus> The stump can still poison
[2:25:52] <Psyramics> WELL THAT SUCKED
[2:25:53] <%YakumoYomi> Restock?
[2:25:54] <valriot> @fojidoj It's viable in Iceborne, using a Velk set and certain swords aka not that viable
[2:25:55] <josemoya95> poison without tail is new or a bug
[2:25:55] <Bryon_Youngblood> "Ugh! That sucked!" - No shit, Sherlock! XD
[2:25:56] <%d1stantutopia> Rathian can poison after a tail cut now?
[2:26:00] <%mikessdd> 30 FPS lock. Gameplay feels about the same as MHW. Some things have been tweaked or reworked entirely though. LS feels very similar. GS too but charges faster.
[2:26:00] <RetributionP> why don't tails bleed when they are cut I wonder
[2:26:01] <+Virtual_Rays> @PatStaresAt Restock back in the tent
[2:26:02] <%Jaxnos> one cart left, yahoo
[2:26:04] <koffeemancer> Box in tent has more potions @PatStaresAt
[2:26:05] <%h0tapplecider> i just slam dunked a large barrel bomb onto a mitzu
[2:26:05] <%d1stantutopia> I've never seen that
[2:26:09] <+Kenidashi> 3 minutes in, yeah loving the voice acting
[2:26:14] <jon651> @monkeyweed21 That's Rathalos. Rathian in world once she lost her tail couldn't posion you
[2:26:17] <+Virtual_Rays> Fair enough
[2:26:21] <%mikessdd> Rathian could always poison after tail cut yeah
[2:26:30] <UnfilteredComic> ***
[2:26:31] <her0_89> whats that thunderbeetle do? Is it like a spark trap lite or something?
[2:26:32] <+redyoshi5> so as a hunting horn player i am conflicted on how much they changed it
[2:26:35] <mostundesired> DEJA VU
[2:26:37] <+aidan_starmanjr> @mikessdd aww was wondering if it'd aim for 50FPS liek the 3DS games did
[2:26:42] <+aidan_starmanjr> *like
[2:26:45] <%YakumoYomi> Rathalos poisons with his claws, not his tail
[2:26:54] <+aWanderingKaivo> I sort of want side missions that are doggo races through the map
[2:26:59] <%Monkeyweed21> @jon651 I thought Rathian could poison with claws or tail while Rathalos was only claws?
[2:27:01] <pokefan9956> hang on....how long until monster hunter kart racer?
[2:27:03] <+redyoshi5> hunting horn is very different
[2:27:19] <+Virtual_Rays> Wait, you can fireblight monsters?
[2:27:23] <josemoya95> in world it doesn't poison you at least some of the time
[2:27:24] <artificiallynatural> I can't believe monsters get blighted now. maybe elemental will have more purpose beyond bonus damage
[2:27:28] <+terry_quest> i think HH got the best out of it all
[2:27:30] <%ChestMimik> Do you think the boss of the game will have you mount a monster onto a bigger monster, Gurren Lagann style?
[2:27:32] <her0_89> @pokefan9956 implying people wont just make their own racing game out of this one
[2:27:35] <+terry_quest> and i hope more people will pick it up
[2:27:43] <%d1stantutopia> HH always and forever best weapon
[2:27:48] <jon651> @monkeyweed21 Pretty sure Rathian was only tail
[2:27:51] <%d1stantutopia> ***
[2:27:58] <artificiallynatural> nice shoulder check
[2:28:00] <convo445> man switch modding is gonna be a super huge thing
[2:28:03] <+bugz_munny> the dogs are SO COOL
[2:28:05] <%BoxNavy> i wish we could be the cool dogs
[2:28:07] <Profmcstevie> .....the dog has cooler weapons than us
[2:28:09] <+bugz_munny> I wanna customize the shit out of mine
[2:28:09] <her0_89> Pretty sure Im gonna go CB main for this game
[2:28:11] <nintega010> Wow this looks better
[2:28:12] <valriot> Wait you got a 3rd wirebug
[2:28:15] <%Emperor_Machinus> Rathian's poison is only on it's tail, Rathalos has it also in his claws
[2:28:19] <+bugz_munny> I wish we could be the dog too
[2:28:35] <%Monkeyweed21> you forgot to carve taik
[2:28:38] <%Monkeyweed21> tail
[2:28:38] <her0_89> @valriot 3rd bug is a pickup on map and is temporary
[2:28:39] <+SinisterBroccoli> it looks like the game runs really well
[2:28:40] <%YakumoYomi> You can pick up Wirebugs during the quest, I think
[2:28:41] <%d1stantutopia> @convo445 this game is coming to PC eventually, according to leaks
[2:28:42] <josemoya95> does anyone know how to do the other plungging attack with the sword?
[2:28:49] <%BoxNavy> SHOOT FIRE AT IT
[2:28:52] <%d1stantutopia> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[2:28:52] <jon651> Wyvern riding time!
[2:28:54] <pokefan9956> YEYEYE
[2:28:56] <%Grimlockfly> This game is also running really well, I thought there my be switch problems, but not seeing it.
[2:28:59] <shutupyouprick> @SinisterBroccoli its absurd its running so well on the switch, RE engine really is magic
[2:29:03] <%spitelite> dude this is so sick
[2:29:14] <dan_g_v> need a tail for a tail attack
[2:29:15] <%Grimlockfly> Now I have a Rathian, ho ho ho
[2:29:17] <valriot> Man, this is just kaiju battles now
[2:29:17] <%d1stantutopia> BET YOU WISH YOU HADN'T CUT THAT TAIL NOW
[2:29:19] <s1rcuit> shoot it with your lizard gun
[2:29:21] <%BoxNavy> OH SHIT RATHIANS PISSED
[2:29:23] <OkamiDude15> stuffed the flash kick with anti air projectile
[2:29:24] <tmo200> this music is od
[2:29:25] <jon651> Omg Rathian is fucking him up!
[2:29:26] <pokefan9956> FUCKING SICK
[2:29:29] <%Blank9> now rathian is my best friend
[2:29:29] <%SGrim> WOMBO COMBO
[2:29:30] <convo445> @d1stantutopia i know but people will already be doing mods for the switch version so it's a head start
[2:29:34] <d1stantutopia> Capcom said "Kaijumon, go"
[2:29:41] <UnfilteredComic> @josemoya95 unless they added a new move, you gotta slide on a slope, hold x and release before the slide ends
[2:29:46] <her0_89> I wonder what tricks they use to get a decent framerate with this game. Cause it runs pretty good even in handheld mode
[2:29:51] <%ScreamLord> Bubble Blight back too?
[2:29:59] <%Emperor_Machinus> What are red bubbles?
[2:30:05] <%d1stantutopia> @ScreamLord yep
[2:30:05] <%kyh9> It's a nice way to expand on turf wars
[2:30:09] <s1rcuit> that tail is begging to be cut off
[2:30:10] <%d1stantutopia> @Emperor_Machinus atk up
[2:30:10] <%kyh9> Lets the player actually do something
[2:30:11] <%BoxNavy> mounting was so pointless and boring
[2:30:11] <her0_89> Yes it is
[2:30:12] <+Kenidashi> nice long jump on that dodge
[2:30:22] <%ChestMimik> FACE BREAK
[2:30:22] <%BoxNavy> YEEEEEEE
[2:30:23] <%Jaxnos> bubble blight but with an attack boost, Machinus
[2:30:24] <illicitdonut> I really hope this comes to PC
[2:30:24] <%d1stantutopia> SICK
[2:30:25] <%Agami23> this song is giving me some nier vibes
[2:30:27] <ChungusQuest> was that a headshot?
[2:30:28] <+aWanderingKaivo> nice
[2:30:29] <swift_malachi> @her0_89 Dramatically better engine that has lower CPU usage
[2:30:30] <%Emperor_Machinus> Thank you
[2:30:31] <%ScreamLord> CLIP IT
[2:30:33] <josemoya95> @UnfilteredComic on the weapon trailers they made a plungging after the wirebug attack
[2:30:33] <+Kenidashi> oooooooo 299
[2:30:34] <convo445> the answer is that the RE engine is the shit
[2:30:40] <+BubbaRands> That must feel so good to do Kreygasm
[2:30:41] <artificiallynatural> NICER
[2:30:46] <%kyh9> SPIN
[2:30:47] <swift_malachi> The MHW engine had some pretty bad threading optimization
[2:30:49] <%Monkeyweed21> the dream is that World 2 has slinger + wirebugs so we get ALL the moves
[2:30:51] <%kyh9> mount
[2:30:52] <%d1stantutopia> YO JUST STAY DOWN MIZU
[2:30:52] <Zombrocom> TRIPLE
[2:30:52] <%Blank9> this poor monster
[2:30:55] <%Campfire_Chronicles> between the music and all the orbs flying around this is honestly just a nier fight
[2:30:58] <%BoxNavy> i like that this is just mizutsunes theme but with vocals
[2:30:58] <+SinisterBroccoli> YES
[2:30:59] <%BoxNavy> OH FUCK
[2:31:00] <UnfilteredComic> ohhhh thats right, not sure

[2:31:34] <shutupyouprick> HOW DOES THIS GAME RUN soooo WELL
[2:31:34] <%kyh9> SO GOOD
[2:31:35] <%ChestMimik> Did That Kaiju Just Do an Aegis Reflector
[2:31:40] <josemoya95> rhas sick!
[2:31:43] <valriot> Is this Hunters voice Barrett????
[2:31:48] <%Monkeyweed21> finisher is probably the water breath spin
[2:31:52] <%d1stantutopia> @shutupyouprick RE Engine is basically magic
[2:31:53] <%BoxNavy> yee
[2:31:54] <Chaoko99> ***
[2:32:00] <+SinisterBroccoli> are there still traps?
[2:32:07] <%BoxNavy> they might as well be knocked over if youre using the ranged weps
[2:32:07] <Sunstalker> Touch the green or red bubbles, Pat. They're heals and buffs
[2:32:07] <dan_g_v> you mean crazy religious hunter?
[2:32:10] <shutupyouprick> @d1stantutopia its magic and I STILL can't believe my eyes, this is ABSURD
[2:32:11] <%Blank9> incoming dead
[2:32:12] <UnfilteredComic> traps are still in
[2:32:17] <Elsewize> This a new game?

[2:32:21] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> What's the best
[2:32:29] <+terry_quest> most likely just not in the demo @SinisterBroccoli
[2:32:30] <AGRO_91> "three mintues of PLAYTIME"
[2:32:34] <%d1stantutopia> Was that a contextual battle bark?
[2:32:35] <dan_g_v> @Elsewize This is monster Hunter Rise demo
[2:32:46] <+aWanderingKaivo> the monsters are destroying the ecosystem and the PLANET CRIES OUT
[2:32:48] <shutupyouprick> having the dog is SUCH a good choice, riding real fast
[2:32:48] <pokefan9956> hey pat, does this game drip?
[2:32:50] <valriot> This is just so much faster and better paced than World. World felt like a slog so much of the time.
[2:33:09] <her0_89> No bomb wakeups?
[2:33:15] <her0_89> then again, GS
[2:33:17] <Sunstalker> Get that red bubble
[2:33:17] <ChungusQuest> OHAYO BITCH
[2:33:23] <%ChestMimik> For real the downtime between encounters in this one feels so much better than world
[2:33:25] <shutupyouprick> need a Vergil voice option for my hunter
[2:33:26] <convo445> World also came out like 3 years ago now
[2:33:27] <SCIENCE_25> Bubbleblight LUL
[2:33:28] <%ashenfrenzy> man that rathian tail still hasnt despawned, cool

[2:34:06] <%fairore> max also died there
[2:34:08] <her0_89> Can you even cap in the demo? I havent seen any tranq bombs and havent seen anything to make them
[2:34:10] <Gravega> This game is a complete downgrade from World, how did they mess up this badly? cmonBruh
[2:34:11] <%Monkeyweed21> What do you say when Easy Mode is already selectable but he still fails?
[2:34:12] <Dutchpotato> Thank you for playing :)
[2:34:33] <%d1stantutopia> @Monkeyweed21 Easier Mode is now selectable
[2:34:36] <%Treuan> That's a sick new animation

[2:34:58] <%ChestMimik> @Monkeyweed21 We relocked Hard mode
[2:35:43] <pokefan9956> man, I hope this game has a monster list comparable to generations
[2:35:50] <+SinisterBroccoli> that seems like a hot take if I ever seen one
[2:35:52] <%fairore> havent played the demo how you guys feel about it?
[2:36:07] <%ChestMimik> @fairore I like it more than world tbh

[2:36:45] <PanicSwytch> Banana Armor
[2:36:49] <%Blank9> power charge
[2:36:49] <%BoxNavy> have you used valor hammer in xx @PatStaresAt

[2:37:01] <rasamune> Royal Banana
[2:37:03] <%Monkeyweed21> @fairore losing slinger is kinda sucks but wirebugs are WAY better than the Clutch Claw and game is overall faster and smoother than World
[2:37:07] <+teh_rawk> embrace zangief
[2:37:08] <%Vorpaled> to go even further beyond
[2:37:15] <marvel877> BAN-ana hammer

[2:38:14] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @Ks201 servers are rocked, everyone is trying to get it
[2:38:15] <%AbnormalVoid> Hammer seems a bit faster
[2:38:15] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Can you jump off a ledge and hammer attack back onto the ledge?
[2:38:18] <SpaceCatStation> try doing the forward step towards an enemy attack
[2:38:32] <PanicSwytch> Why is this a timed demo
[2:38:36] <+SinisterBroccoli> That water sound is acting weird whenever another sound happens
[2:38:42] <+thatguychris93> @Ks201 what i did was hit download and stay on the eshop for a few minutes and then checked if it started downloading. that took about 3 tries before working
[2:39:02] <%Monkeyweed21> oh you can manually turn power charge off and on
[2:39:05] <+SinisterBroccoli> cuz capcom said so
[2:39:07] <%Blank9> ARE YOU READY?

[2:39:47] <her0_89> I will never not laugh at the banana hat
[2:39:56] <%watts121> MH Rise is the game where we ignore our Palico for our new Dog.
[2:40:06] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> If possible, please check if you can roll off a ledge and hammer attack back onto the same ledge
[2:40:12] <+thatguychris93> @PatStaresAt have you pet the pup yet?
[2:40:16] <+Jaysky> I always saw this armor as a big sponge
[2:40:22] <%fairore> @watts121 oh nooo
[2:40:22] <+SinisterBroccoli> isn't the palico now stronger or something to compensate?
[2:40:30] <%d1stantutopia> @watts121 you can take 2 dogs and actually ignore your Palico
[2:40:46] <+BubbaRands> @watts121 Pali-wha now?
[2:41:01] <%SGrim> Bullied by Pooh Bear LUL
[2:41:09] <+itsgundamu> boy it sure has
[2:41:12] <%AbnormalVoid> I can tell LUL
[2:41:16] <%WhereIsWill> the omni whiffs LUL
[2:41:16] <%Euphbugg> Bear does not care for banana hunter
[2:41:29] <+BubbaRands> Monhun 4U if i recall correctly
[2:41:31] <her0_89> I wonder if the palicos can still wake you up from stun. Though, that would require you to get stunned first.
[2:41:39] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:41:40] <%d1stantutopia> dw Pat, we can BEAR with your UNBEARABLY bad play
[2:41:55] <pokefan9956> okay. so I'm not crazy. somebody earlier called arzuros a badger and I thought I was crazy for thinking it was a bear
[2:42:01] <+itsgundamu> Does the Hammer Icon on the top left doe anything
[2:42:10] <%d1stantutopia> it's a beardger
[2:42:12] <her0_89> What are you talking about, thats not a bear, thats a honey badger.
[2:42:17] <Chaoko99> @pokefan9956 holy shit
[2:42:21] <+Grayhammatter> wait, what the fuck is this?
[2:42:28] <BerryliciousDefinition> Yeah its a badger
[2:42:34] <%Higure_yoru> Does charging and A still give you a buff?
[2:42:35] <her0_89> The rodeo.
[2:42:41] <majindusto> That is one PISSED OFF Honey Badger
[2:42:48] <%d1stantutopia> @grayhammatter better mounting
[2:42:52] <+BubbaRands> Honey Badger don't care! He just takes what it wants!
[2:42:55] <%SirGO0SE> holy shit I just saw the Gengar bed on twitter
[2:42:59] <her0_89> How much damage does launching the monsters into each other do?
[2:43:03] <%kyh9> GET BACK HERE BOY
[2:43:03] <%WhereIsWill> he said nah fam im out
[2:43:06] <+Grayhammatter> poor pooh bear
[2:43:10] <%Euphbugg> Bear done with mean bananas
[2:43:17] <Noogiez> yo
[2:43:18] <geniesoap> Hol' up, there is a new Monster Hunter?
[2:43:22] <susukouhai> tongue bed...
[2:43:23] <OkamiDude15> the gengar bed could fit 2 whole pats
[2:43:24] <%d1stantutopia> couldn't bear the heat of battle
[2:43:32] <her0_89> Switch only so far Genie
[2:43:32] <+aWanderingKaivo> bear don't want that banana he like "noo"
[2:43:37] <pokefan9956> just checked the wiki. unless I'm missing a joke, it's a bear
[2:43:50] <her0_89> And this is just a demo. Full game out in March
[2:43:52] <UnfilteredComic> omg
[2:43:55] <susukouhai> dat gengar bed is one step away from v o r e sleepingbag
[2:43:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @geniesoap PC later, according to those leaks from last year too
[2:43:58] <%kyh9> @geniesoap Yeah, where've you been. It's a Switch Exclusive on the RE Engine that lets you do Spiderman moves as well as pilot the monsters
[2:43:58] <%WhereIsWill> NICE
[2:44:09] <Darkfire346> Has he Eekumed the Bokum yet?
[2:44:13] <%AzureGale> AMAZING
[2:44:14] <%BoxNavy> AMAZAMAZING
[2:44:14] <pitsuji> AMAING
[2:44:15] <SilverFeng> AMAZING
[2:44:16] <+trav2_> amazing
[2:44:19] <%d1stantutopia> Get on the kaiju, Shinji
[2:44:24] <Chaoko99> wait is an azuros a wyvern?
[2:44:27] <%AzureGale> AMAMAZING
[2:44:42] <RoboticRexkek> looks pretty good for switch
[2:44:44] <%BoxNavy> arzuros is a fanged beast
[2:44:47] <lovesosa236> this game is running so well
[2:44:47] <%d1stantutopia> @chaoko99 fanged beast
[2:44:47] <+itsgundamu> thought they were all technically Wyverns
[2:44:54] <T_Sasquatch> Wait what the fuck. Is this game at 480p ????
[2:44:59] <Chaoko99> it said ride wyvern
[2:45:03] <%Ynkubus_> Nah, theres fanged beasts too
[2:45:05] <+BubbaRands> Honey Badger dont give a shit!
[2:45:09] <pokefan9956> y'know, we need an anime about kids having to pilot monsters to save the world from invading robots
[2:45:24] <RoboticRexkek> dynamic resolution?
[2:45:30] <Yemmer> All monsters are called wyverns in MH @Chaoko99
[2:45:30] <%d1stantutopia> I'd watch the shit out of that
[2:45:31] <artificiallynatural> there are beasts too like rajang and zinogre
[2:45:31] <her0_89> @pokefan9956 theres already a monhun game where you ride monsters
[2:45:37] <+Grayhammatter> this arzuros is chunkin' you
[2:45:45] <%SaiyanShoto> I like that rise seems to have a lot more diverse monsters than World
[2:45:52] <%dozind16> having fun?
[2:46:04] <pokefan9956> right. but I want the reverse of the trope of "mechs fighting giant monsters"
[2:46:08] <her0_89> lol
[2:46:11] <NenaFan101> Quite a lot for an armored bear
[2:46:13] <her0_89> too much damage
[2:46:14] <+GomiGallery> what's the hammer icon next to sharpness?
[2:46:15] <Profmcstevie> SHORYUUUKEEN
[2:46:17] <AngryPhant0m> Ok. here me out if you are playing online with your friend and you both mount different monsters could you technically have a kaiju battle with your friend
[2:46:17] <%Monkeyweed21> are you forgetting to eat @PatStaresAt ?
[2:46:18] <pokefan9956> have the main characters ride the monsters to fight robots
[2:46:20] <+itsgundamu> God this voice acting is weird
[2:46:20] <marklarphd> Azuros is so fluffy now
[2:46:23] <%d1stantutopia> @saiyanshoto they managed to get all the weird skeletons that World couldn't handle working on the RE Engine
[2:46:25] <Rawklobstah88> Hey, Hunting Horn feels real good this time.
[2:46:28] <DestroyerPhoenix> they have so much personality from these voicelines it's great
[2:46:29] <her0_89> i dont mind the characters talking, just not so much
[2:46:30] <%preeeow> I love posh hammer bro
[2:46:33] <T_Sasquatch> What's the arrow ?
[2:46:35] <%moogleboy1984> I dislike the killing of Pangolin Badger
[2:46:40] <fojidoj> Yeah the talking is great
[2:46:43] <%SaiyanShoto> @d1stantutopia ohh ok that explains it
[2:46:47] <+GomiGallery> oh it's power charge
[2:46:52] <UnfilteredComic> I imagine its just another movement option
[2:46:58] <%AzureGale> Take risks, get rewards
[2:46:59] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Sometimes you want the move attack level 1 and a2
[2:46:59] <%d1stantutopia> @angryphant0m that's fucking genius
[2:46:59] <KingVantq> Isnt the RE engine revamped MT Framework?
[2:47:00] <%Monkeyweed21> regular charge and power charge have different moves
[2:47:17] <majindusto> The game is called MONSTER HUNTER tho...not WYVERN HUNTER scottfPathetic
[2:47:20] <+gaemjurnalist> same, after playing shittons of ffxiv characters talking at all just really makes me happy
[2:47:23] <%Monkeyweed21> they take longer
[2:47:25] <+itsgundamu> iti gave you more damage in world
[2:47:26] <astrophizz> @KingVantq basically, I think
[2:47:29] <%Aydarkzero> what weapon do you usually run pat?
[2:47:36] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Why not use your strongest damage attack every time in street fighter?
[2:47:37] <%Monkeyweed21> especially the level 3
[2:47:42] <%d1stantutopia> @kingvantq I thought it was something completely different, but it's a fucking miracle engine so they're using it for everything
[2:47:49] <%Aydarkzero> psaBig & strong haha
[2:47:54] <UnfilteredComic> You can do a max level Blue move then power charge into a lvl 3 yellow
[2:47:55] <her0_89> Pat is usually a GS kinda guy
[2:47:58] <%Aydarkzero> the demo is pretty fun
[2:48:01] <+itsgundamu> is this running at 60fps?
[2:48:03] <her0_89> but like, gotta try em all
[2:48:06] <+trav2_> fuck that jagras in particular
[2:48:06] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Uppercut in world had best stun value of any attack
[2:48:10] <+aWanderingKaivo> a bit
[2:48:23] <+itsgundamu> or is it a locked 30?
[2:48:24] <artificiallynatural> I imagine it's for more control like hitting a weaker attack during the trip so you can get the second trip on the oki
[2:49:08] <her0_89> Hey pat, what did you think of the new training area they showed off today?
[2:49:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I really like the yokai-inspired designs for the new monsters in Rise. Very stylish
[2:49:24] <artificiallynatural> pretty sure it's locked 30. it's a really consistent 30 tho
[2:49:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> GOO KAZOO
[2:49:35] <T_Sasquatch> I hope weapons like lance aren't completely useless unless you have highly specific decos
[2:49:39] <%d1stantutopia> Rise overall seems very stylish, I love it
[2:49:49] <+itsgundamu> hmmmmm, world spoiled me with 120 FPS
[2:49:51] <%Monkeyweed21> oh cool the switch back to regular works like a GS tackle
[2:49:54] <%Aydarkzero> i like the Callouts the Hunters make
[2:50:08] <artificiallynatural> the callouts seem really useful ngl
[2:50:20] <%Aydarkzero> the Intermediate boss is kind of annoying though
[2:50:22] <%BoxNavy> new hammer is kinda confusing
[2:50:22] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Hammer feels best of all weapons
[2:50:30] <Rawklobstah88> Is that a Ludroth hammer and armor?
[2:50:34] <%d1stantutopia> @t_sasquatch Lance got a new special guard that buffs your attack more the more dmg you block
[2:50:36] <%Aydarkzero> any SnS users here?
[2:50:37] <%BoxNavy> yes
[2:50:45] <+Jaysky> @Rawklobstah88 Yep
[2:50:51] <%Zundelle> big bonkin
[2:50:57] <+Grayhammatter> glad to see ludroth is back

[2:51:25] <%fairore> oh he limpin

[2:51:26] <Profmcstevie> Monster Hunter animators know how to make something SMACK real good
[2:51:34] <%d1stantutopia> HH looks so good tho
[2:51:41] <Saltmeisterr> U MADE HIM CRY
[2:51:45] <Saltmeisterr> D:
[2:51:50] <+bugz_munny> they thought this series needed more dragons dogma so they made all the hunters talk nonstop
[2:51:54] <Rawklobstah88> With so many Leviathans, we could maybe get Lagi? Maybe?
[2:51:54] <+Rafraud> How does eshop constantly die Like this
[2:51:56] <pilllowofbees> i wonder what kind of weapons the dog will have
[2:51:58] <+itsgundamu> yea HH you can do some insane shit now
[2:52:13] <Rawklobstah88> HH feels so good to play.
[2:52:17] <%YakumoYomi> It's one of the things I lament about games like God Eater and Toukiden: a lot of the weapon impacts are lacking compared to MH
[2:52:23] <her0_89> @Rafraud lol its Nintendo. Since when do they know online?
[2:52:28] <Rawklobstah88> I thought Echo waves was amazing, but this is just bonkers.
[2:52:35] <artificiallynatural> when will my hunter call out "they're weak to ice and fire boOoOoth"
[2:52:40] <%fairore> @rafraud yeah i heard it was a struggle right now
[2:52:41] <+aWanderingKaivo> I like the ground impact visuals
[2:52:48] <%d1stantutopia> RIP me, have to wait for PC version to doot once more

[2:54:45] <i_am_therydon> thats the right attitude
[2:54:46] <%SirGO0SE> true :)
[2:54:46] <@SoFarFetched> when they bombed his teammates on purpose
[2:54:46] <%fairore> my feeling
[2:54:46] <%d1stantutopia> LUL
[2:54:47] <%CzeekyPlays> We are all trash, including you tho

[2:54:55] <%Monkeyweed21> this is why you will never be as big as Max

[2:55:07] <%baka_sugoi> psaWhat ew chat
[2:55:09] <SCIENCE_25> Carry us if you're so good.
[2:55:09] <%Monkeyweed21> you need to hide your contempt JUST A LITTLE
[2:55:11] <Zeif00> If we're trash, you're king of the junkyard
[2:55:17] <%Aydarkzero> pit fall trap psaDogchamp
[2:55:28] <%d1stantutopia> @whereiswill weird way to spell Hunting Horn, but doot on brother!
[2:55:34] <ChungusQuest> does that make Giefy a junkyard dog?
[2:55:34] <%Nekros4442> God that dog is literally Repede
[2:55:51] <+Grayhammatter> uh... what?
[2:55:52] <+aWanderingKaivo> what is that
[2:56:00] <%Aydarkzero> is that suppose to be a counter?
[2:56:01] <Zombrocom> Pat has learned that no matter how much contempt he throws at his audience, people will still shower him with money
[2:56:01] <LoneFonte> counter?
[2:56:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Parry stance
[2:56:05] <%baka_sugoi> long boi
[2:56:05] <her0_89> A parry
[2:56:09] <%Monkeyweed21> the Iai is super important too
[2:56:12] <%Aydarkzero> makes sense
[2:56:16] <Rawklobstah88> DO THE PARRY
[2:56:20] <%Jaxnos> what is the puppo just murking in the corner there with his kunai?
[2:56:25] <%SirGO0SE> Pat streaming with Joel :)
[2:56:28] <+aWanderingKaivo> so how many counters does LS even have now lol
[2:56:41] <+bugz_munny> thats iceborne stuff you never learned
[2:56:47] <Zombrocom> LS has three counters now
[2:56:47] <her0_89> IMO special sheath is one of the best additions to any weapons movesets
[2:56:48] <pilllowofbees> LS has 3 now LUL
[2:56:49] <+Dova573> now do Judgement cuts
[2:57:00] <%Monkeyweed21> frame perfect counters
[2:57:05] <@SoFarFetched> yeah Pat never really fully got to Iceborne I believe geefThink
[2:57:07] <%GinAndRoses> MEOW
[2:57:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> i LIKE THAT YOUR CAT'S NAME IS JOEL
[2:57:11] <%Aydarkzero> lmao
[2:57:11] <KingVantq> i think Pat completely stopped world after the one iceborne stream
[2:57:17] <koffeemancer> Helm splitter is silkbind now @PatStaresAt
[2:57:21] <Zombrocom> Helm splitter is locked behind the silk bind kick attack
[2:57:24] <jon651> Iceborne was pretty bad
[2:57:27] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah pat didn't wanna do all that grind to get to iceborne stuff
[2:57:32] <%Jaxnos> bullied by grimalkynes
[2:57:37] <dan_g_v> helm splitter is with silk, no?
[2:57:40] <KingVantq> @jon651 youre crazy
[2:57:42] <Rawklobstah88> Shara Ishvalda
[2:57:49] <+itsgundamu> Fair Enough
[2:57:51] <%Aydarkzero> you made the right choice
[2:57:54] <SCIENCE_25> Helmsplitter is an aerial. You don't need Swordmaster for it.
[2:57:55] <@SoFarFetched> yeah thats fair
[2:57:57] <+itsgundamu> Grinding Lands is fucked
[2:58:00] <%Monkeyweed21> fake fan]
[2:58:02] <dan_g_v> say, has Pat found the Tanuki things?
[2:58:02] <@SoFarFetched> I pretty much stopped there too
[2:58:11] <her0_89> Im with pat on that. I never even made it to MR 60
[2:58:12] <%Aydarkzero> it's better now but i still don't like it
[2:58:14] <jon651> @kingvantq nah just didn't like iceborne
[2:58:15] <pilllowofbees> yah its a skill now thank god
[2:58:16] <%charp35> Grinding lands sucked I hope this game has a better end game
[2:58:19] <Zombrocom> Guiding lands was great though
[2:58:21] <%Jaxnos> guiding lands eventually got to a fun place, but yeah
[2:58:28] <+itsgundamu> I pushed on but I didn't like it, stupid wall they put in. Just lemme see the shit stop making me grind
[2:58:28] <+Grayhammatter> this actually looks surprisingly crisp
[2:58:40] <+AWr00tBear> Didn’t even defeat Fatalis?
[2:58:43] <Zombrocom> Hey that's the handlers voice
[2:58:43] <%Zundelle> the guiding lands were pretty fun but asking you to grind that MR seemed real dumb
[2:58:45] <+bugz_munny> I played it post-fixes so it was fine for me
[2:58:45] <her0_89> Guiding lands was a good idea but needs better execution.
[2:58:49] <%Aydarkzero> yeah i'm surprised by the performance
[2:58:54] <+RowenCleric> guiding lands is ok with a sdd installed
[2:58:55] <%AzureGale> "This is gonna be hard!" - lines to say while in bed
[2:58:55] <%Jaxnos> it took like two or three content updates before i felt like staying in the guiding lands
[2:59:01] <pilllowofbees> yeah i also enjoyed grinding lands its fun to just never stop
[2:59:07] <Zombrocom> Pats hunter is voiced by the handler/eri
[2:59:23] <+bugz_munny> The hunt-a-thon aspect was the best part
[2:59:26] <aaranaf> Ahh the moaning simulator.
[2:59:28] <%Monkeyweed21> yea Guiding Lands took a few updates to get good
[2:59:28] <+GundamF91> Guiding Lands are grindy but u unlocked a buncha new Monsters in it so I thought it was pretty great idk
[2:59:31] <dan_g_v> ah yes, incorrectly used quotes MonHun version
[2:59:33] <ChungusQuest> @AzureGale I thought I heard "This is getting me hard!"
[2:59:36] <%Aydarkzero> @Zombrocom also Coco Bandicoot in Crash 4
[2:59:39] <%cervidaequus> ProZD’s vid abt suggestive lines is echoing in my head
[2:59:56] <%Monkeyweed21> its a counter @PatStaresAt
[3:00:01] <her0_89> Getting those parries is gonna be easy with all these callouts.
[3:00:03] <%AzureGale> @ChungusQuest Also a line to say in bed :p
[3:00:09] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[3:00:12] <@SoFarFetched> "BE CAREFUL! -dies-"
[3:00:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> TO THE CART
[3:00:13] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> How does this compare to the MHW demo?
[3:00:14] <dan_g_v> somebody is going to rip the voice lines and do something naughty with it
[3:00:14] <+Grayhammatter> rippy dippy
[3:00:15] <Profmcstevie> The frame the animation begins
[3:00:16] <Rawklobstah88> The Sheathe is a counter D:
[3:00:20] <+Cobaltor_252> is she saying "this is getting me hard"
[3:00:20] <%GinAndRoses> just call him Carti P
[3:00:31] <Nordguy> @patstaresat the fireball effect lingers
[3:00:35] <%YakumoYomi> Special Sheathe
[3:00:35] <her0_89> No, the sheath has a counter move
[3:00:36] <+Dova573> it can be used as a counter
[3:00:39] <%Aydarkzero> this is going to hit hard
[3:00:48] <her0_89> The act of sheathing does not counter.
[3:00:51] <+bugz_munny> you can use one pip of meter to counter
[3:00:54] <%Monkeyweed21> the slash
[3:00:55] <Zombrocom> In special sheath, the double slash builds meter, and the single slash costs meter but is a counter
[3:00:56] <+bugz_munny> but its better to just foresight
[3:00:59] <her0_89> unless they changed it for rise.
[3:01:00] <Rawklobstah88> The dash slash is a counter
[3:01:06] <pilllowofbees> the hold
[3:01:07] <%Aydarkzero> Rathian LUL
[3:01:14] <%GinAndRoses> you scared it
[3:01:18] <%GinAndRoses> so menacing
[3:01:23] <+bugz_munny> Honestly when in doubt, foresight
[3:01:27] <%Aydarkzero> cut it's tail off
[3:01:41] <%AzureGale> AMAZING
[3:01:48] <+bugz_munny> The attack after the sheath will make your meter fill constantly
[3:01:58] <+Grayhammatter> what a cool mechanic
[3:01:59] <her0_89> hmm, mounting monsters seems like its going to be a good time to bomb them
[3:02:00] <+bugz_munny> just a basic attack
[3:02:00] <+Dova573> so is old mounting gone right?
[3:02:06] <+Dova573> and this is replacing it?
[3:02:06] <her0_89> just launch them into bombs
[3:02:16] <Cyphereous> Seems so, Dova
[3:02:27] <%Aydarkzero> yeah i think this is just new mount
[3:02:35] <koffeemancer> You can special sheath after the spirit combo btw
[3:02:35] <%charp35> So how do you do helm splitter?
[3:02:36] <+bugz_munny> nice
[3:02:38] <+bugz_munny> yeah
[3:02:40] <+Gangjute8> the hitsparks and attacks feel less impactful than in mhw?
[3:02:40] <%Nekros4442> Did 100+ dmg
[3:02:41] <Rawklobstah88> I saw 113
[3:02:42] <%YakumoYomi> It did
[3:02:45] <%WhereIsWill> nice! i think
[3:02:46] <+Grayhammatter> i think?
[3:02:46] <ChungusQuest> 113 damage
[3:02:49] <UnfilteredComic> yes did 113
[3:02:51] <Zombrocom> Yeah it did 113 damage
[3:02:53] <%BoxNavy> careful pat. here it comes.
[3:02:57] <pilllowofbees> i think it missed
[3:03:04] <+cyber_maverick_87> Sup Pat
[3:03:13] <%AzureGale> "Here he comes" - A line to say during a threesome
[3:03:20] <%YakumoYomi> Different armor set
[3:03:20] <%BoxNavy> because you dont know this weapon
[3:03:21] <+bugz_munny> It's a rathian in rage mode dude
[3:03:22] <her0_89> weaker armor?
[3:03:31] <Nordguy> did pat not learn his radial menu?
[3:03:35] <%Aydarkzero> cause you're using a Dex build Kappa
[3:03:36] <her0_89> check the armor rating when you get a chance.
[3:03:38] <%baka_sugoi> mid tier armor
[3:03:39] <+bugz_munny> nice
[3:03:42] <%Nekros4442> wow that starts up so uqickly
[3:03:43] <%Nekros4442> holy shit
[3:03:50] <%d1stantutopia> ded
[3:03:51] <+bugz_munny> ded
[3:03:52] <Rawklobstah88> YEAH
[3:03:53] <%Nekros4442> There's literally no start up time on the counter
[3:03:55] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:03:58] <+Grayhammatter> ded
[3:03:59] <%CzeekyPlays> rip
[3:03:59] <%Euphbugg> ded
[3:03:59] <%baka_sugoi> dded
[3:04:00] <her0_89> Also, doesnt GS have higher base defense than LS?
[3:04:01] <%WhereIsWill> mid potion LUL
[3:04:03] <%Wade_Willson> monkaS
[3:04:05] <HollowBeansVG> these animations are great
[3:04:06] <%miguelrod777> git gud pat LUL
[3:04:09] <%AzureGale> That is some FAST revival mechanics
[3:04:11] <%YakumoYomi> So the counter triggers on frame 1?
[3:04:13] <Rawklobstah88> CATCH A RIIIIIIDE
[3:04:15] <+bugz_munny> You need to do better pat!
[3:04:22] <@BigNaturalMan59> thebetCas
[3:04:24] <Profmcstevie> Hey it's your uber, I'm outside CorgiDerp
[3:04:31] <+bugz_munny> Foresight!
[3:04:38] <%Wade_Willson> psaDown
[3:04:45] <her0_89> Oh hey, your spirit gauge no longer depletes on death.
[3:04:48] <+bugz_munny> You can foresight anythiiiiing
[3:04:49] <@SoFarFetched> oh shit BigNaturalMan is here
[3:04:55] <Rawklobstah88> Stop doing thing bad, Pat. Do thing good.
[3:04:57] <+bugz_munny> even monster screams
[3:04:58] <T_Sasquatch> Omg shut up character
[3:05:14] <%AzureGale> BE CAREFUL

[3:05:22] <@BigNaturalMan59> anyone wanna play some ffxi
[3:05:23] <+cyber_maverick_87> HypeCoin
[3:05:27] <+bugz_munny> nice!
[3:05:35] <Nordguy> i think you can change character bark frequency in settings
[3:05:54] <%Wool> Wool subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! Do you think Rise will be a good entry point for MonHun? I tried playing it first on the 3DS and was pushed away by the controls.
[3:05:56] <+aWanderingKaivo> @PatStaresAt you can chain into the iai moves after the last spirit roundslash that sheathes the sword
[3:05:57] <%Taisuru> Big damage
[3:06:01] <%Aydarkzero> oof
[3:06:01] <+bugz_munny> If you hit it, you contantly gain meter for spirit combo
[3:06:06] <%baka_sugoi> fail
[3:06:07] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[3:06:07] <%AzureGale> FAILURE
[3:06:08] <UnfilteredComic> makes your meter builf
[3:06:09] <%Campfire_Chronicles> its to be a big anime man
[3:06:12] <%BoxNavy> the double slash fills meter
[3:06:12] <%WhereIsWill> craaazy dmg
[3:06:14] <her0_89> the double slash makes your spirit gauge charge over time.
[3:06:15] <tanarath> rip
[3:06:15] <@BigNaturalMan59> pat whyd u die ur not supposed to die
[3:06:16] <Mushinronja> the double hit starts auto filling gauge
[3:06:20] <%baka_sugoi> EZ MODE UNLOCK
[3:06:21] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt The double slash? It builds meter
[3:06:21] <+bugz_munny> so start a combo with an slash
[3:06:21] <Rawklobstah88> Sheathe into Iai Slash gives you lots of meter is a counter
[3:06:23] <%AzureGale> Pat wasn't careful enough
[3:06:26] <%TheWinged7> 30 hunts done
[3:06:28] <%BoxNavy> the big slash does big damage if you use it like a counter
[3:06:28] <Mangahero18> too hard for babeh pat. easy mode needed.
[3:06:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> meter fill over time
[3:06:32] <tanarath> easy mode unlocked?
[3:06:33] <%Aydarkzero> HH monkaS
[3:06:35] <radiosanchezz> hitting with the sheath attack will continually build up sword meter
[3:06:37] <susukouhai> time for doot doot
[3:06:40] <UnfilteredComic> oh hell yea
[3:06:41] <%miguelrod777> not skilled enough to use greatsword

[3:06:49] <%Blank9> HH
[3:06:50] <Profmcstevie> Tootin and dootin

[3:06:57] <%baka_sugoi> SLUP BASS
[3:07:00] <+bugz_munny> With Iai and foresight you can just stay constantly hitting a monster
[3:07:01] <her0_89> Ah, I see pat is a proponent of One more Hunt.
[3:07:03] <+bugz_munny> It's insane
[3:07:07] <+kumaprime> FEST QUAILED
[3:07:11] <Rawklobstah88> Okay, so ZR is Self Improvement
[3:07:12] <%d1stantutopia> YEYEYEYEYE

[3:07:41] <OneThousandTomatoes> high five cat
[3:07:44] <%Wade_Willson> Ture
[3:07:45] <%Monkeyweed21> If Pat fails again can we call him a Dauntless fan?
[3:07:45] <+Grayhammatter> if only
[3:07:46] <Cyphereous> If only Randal wasn't such scum
[3:07:46] <+bugz_munny> combat was aight
[3:07:47] <%Aydarkzero> i got bl3 for free and dropped it LUL
[3:07:47] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> If only
[3:07:47] <%baka_sugoi> lol
[3:07:49] <Mangahero18> Borderlands 3 is okay.
[3:07:49] <SCIENCE_25> Nice things would be nice.
[3:07:52] <her0_89> Was that a cobra on teh ground?
[3:07:53] <MrYoke> It's fine, Monster Hunter is a better coop game :^)
[3:07:58] <%Taisuru> All borderlands except the first one were bad fight me
[3:07:59] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Maybe a different studio has to reinvent borderlands
[3:07:59] <%Emperor_Machinus> it's okay
[3:07:59] <T_Sasquatch> what's wrong with bl3
[3:08:00] <+Cobaltor_252> it would've been nice if the writing didn't make me want to off myself
[3:08:02] <Go4theKnees> did pat beat cyberpunk or did he just not even bother?
[3:08:04] <%Campfire_Chronicles> Borderlands 3: Allegedly
[3:08:06] <%FacetiousAF> mr. pat "dauntless" boivin?
[3:08:06] <tanarath> It would be nice if randy wasn't cancer
[3:08:07] <ChungusQuest> lol I forgot BL3 existed
[3:08:08] <artificiallynatural> yo apparently the wirebug jump resets insect glaive's aerial jump so you can stay in the air for a stupid amount of time
[3:08:18] <+AWr00tBear> Borderlands 3 is good coward
[3:08:21] <%Agami23> dauntless feels like the type of game woolie would play instead of monster hunter
[3:08:32] <+Grayhammatter> wow, that's so quick
[3:08:33] <Mangahero18> I had fun playing the game with Amara. Punch Girl is fun.
[3:08:35] <DraxTD> Maybe that was thier plan @PatStaresAt ... maybe they made boarderlans 3 terrible so you wouldn't stream it
[3:08:40] <PanicSwytch> I still prefer to play BL 1 or 2
[3:08:44] <tanarath> @chungusquest That is the worst insult you could give to a game
[3:08:49] <PleasedWorld> borderlands 3 is fine but bl2 is far better
[3:08:50] <%TheWinged7> @Taisuru i think BL2 plays better but otherwise 100% agreed
[3:08:52] <Rawklobstah88> Also, don't forget A + X
[3:08:54] <%Taisuru> @Agami23 I don't think woolie could get past the mmo daily systems
[3:08:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> Borderlands 3 is solid.
[3:08:55] <+bugz_munny> BL2 is way better by far
[3:08:56] <+aWanderingKaivo> next game IG users are just going to straight up have wings and never touch the ground
[3:09:00] <PleasedWorld> also bl3 story is actual garbage
[3:09:01] <+bearwagon> yo is this man breakdancing
[3:09:16] <+bugz_munny> BL2 is just structured better
[3:09:20] <Rawklobstah88> YEAH
[3:09:20] <%Naho_Saenoki> @aWanderingKaivo You mean they don't already?
[3:09:20] <T_Sasquatch> @agami23 you're so right. I've no idea why anyone would play Dauntless if they owned a monster hunter game
[3:09:20] <LoneFonte> WHAT
[3:09:22] <%GinAndRoses> he loves them sick beats
[3:09:22] <Rawklobstah88> HES DOING THE THING
[3:09:24] <%WhereIsWill> DAFUQ

[3:09:35] <%trustycoyote> Yeah HH is fucking nuts
[3:09:35] <Rawklobstah88> It's basically a brand new weapon
[3:09:37] <dan_g_v> poweeer!

[3:09:38] <ChungusQuest> @tanarath why yes, yes it is
[3:09:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> next insect glaive transforms the user into an insect
[3:09:40] <%Agami23> @Taisuru i thought that about teppen

[3:10:08] <%trustycoyote> @d1stantutopia This guy knows whatsup
[3:10:12] <%d1stantutopia> PAT USE THE SILKBIND
[3:10:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Insect Glaive will just let you henshin with your kinsect
[3:10:18] <%Wade_Willson> Is that Barrios armor??
[3:10:18] <her0_89> Can you encore the songs or no?
[3:10:19] <%cylish> Any chance this has a "local play" option?
[3:10:23] <Rawklobstah88> Some were
[3:10:23] <%d1stantutopia> @trustycoyote ayy, my fellow dooter
[3:10:29] <her0_89> It does
[3:10:29] <%d1stantutopia> THEY SUPER WERE
[3:10:32] <UnfilteredComic> completley new
[3:10:38] <+bugz_munny> dude this looks so different
[3:10:41] <UnfilteredComic> ok similar
[3:10:41] <%d1stantutopia> pat use the big silkbind
[3:10:44] <%d1stantutopia> Earthshaker
[3:10:44] <%Blank9> HH is all about having every angle possible to hit
[3:10:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> there is local play,
[3:10:55] <her0_89> @cylish the demo does so I woudl imagine the base game will too.
[3:10:59] <%YakumoYomi> Is Rise going to the game that makes HH popular?
[3:11:01] <%Blank9> you hit behind your back and above your shoulder half the time
[3:11:07] <her0_89> But I think its local connection between two switches.
[3:11:15] <%Blank9> super song on ZR+X unlocked
[3:11:17] <+bugz_munny> It's probably gonna be super broken
[3:11:18] <her0_89> I doubt there will be split screen
[3:11:22] <Profmcstevie> HH is the true unga, hitbox go everywhere
[3:11:23] <%d1stantutopia> Pat please use Earthshaker, you're going to love it
[3:11:23] <%Monkeyweed21> whens the last time you played HH?
[3:11:25] <+bugz_munny> so yeah itll be popular
[3:11:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> the arrows are pointing towards your target, you can turn them off in the options
[3:11:28] <Zombrocom> Man, they really took the fact that HH was the least popular weapon to heart huh
[3:11:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> HEY chat, if you told the Monster Hunter Rise demo to download, but it didn't start right away, check your console, it might have finished when you weren't looking, might downloaded after all
[3:11:31] <%d1stantutopia> YEYEYEYE
[3:11:31] <+Grayhammatter> 162? jesus
[3:11:31] <%trustycoyote> yeyeye
[3:11:32] <hamborgini> @YakumoYomi maybe, all they had to do was completely redesign it from the ground up!
[3:11:46] <@SoFarFetched> Master Utsushi it seems
[3:11:48] <@SoFarFetched> going "AMAZING"
[3:11:49] <+bugz_munny> someone at capcom REALLY wants people to play HH

[3:12:21] <+bugz_munny> that's stupid damage
[3:12:23] <Yemmer> World is Capcoms best seller of all time @YakumoYomi
[3:12:23] <UnfilteredComic> SONG OF RAGING FLAME
[3:12:24] <Profmcstevie> I hope the bagpipes are in this Kappa
[3:12:25] <Rawklobstah88> I know
[3:12:25] <%Blank9> HH is THE BEST
[3:12:27] <%YakumoYomi> @hamborgini Just making songs trigger without needing to perform a recital is a major change
[3:12:27] <Rawklobstah88> It's fucking great
[3:12:28] <+Grayhammatter> song of raging flame? the hell?
[3:12:33] <Zombrocom> That's a fucking super
[3:12:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> very much Switch exclusive
[3:12:36] <%BoxNavy> its so much better
[3:12:37] <LoneFonte> so much faster
[3:12:39] <%Taisuru> Is Switch Axe at all closer to how it used to be or is it still just MHWorld SwAxe?
[3:12:39] <%TheWinged7> no longer standing still for 5 seconds to play
[3:12:40] <%BoxNavy> and i liked the old hh
[3:12:44] <%d1stantutopia> SONG OF RAGING FLAME! psaBig ATK UP
[3:12:49] <%Monkeyweed21> yea that spin move got changed from a modifier to a super
[3:12:49] <%Blank9> song of raging flame is the hidden song on this, huge ATK boost from it
[3:12:52] <UnfilteredComic> I think you get a special buff after infernal performance
[3:13:04] <+KaijuUltimax> Holy shit this is actually running on Switch?
[3:13:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> much like how MH3 through Generations is Nintendo exclusive and MH1 to 3 is Playstation exclusive (World is not exclusive at all)
[3:13:18] <%d1stantutopia> @UnfilteredComic Not only is it a special buff, it's horn-specific apparently
[3:13:20] <+yoshkosh20> game looks great in motion, but how is the waifu game?
[3:13:22] <%Blank9> you unlock it from hitting a lot and filling the HH icon to the right of sharpness
[3:13:23] <%trustycoyote> Yes, this is running on the Switch
[3:13:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> MH1 through all versions of MH2^
[3:13:36] <UnfilteredComic> @d1stantutopia Oh shitttt i love that
[3:13:40] <%d1stantutopia> LOOK AT THIS SHIT
[3:13:46] <Yemmer> And even it couldnt make HH popular @YakumoYomi
[3:13:46] <%FacetiousAF> those are some big goddamn numbers
[3:13:50] <+yoshkosh20> I hope gunlance is still good.
[3:13:51] <T_Sasquatch> Atleast rise is coming to pc
[3:13:52] <+tetraes> the framerate isn't an issue even though it's on switch?
[3:13:58] <Rawklobstah88> ZR is that slide attack
[3:14:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> World is on Xbox and Steam, so it;s not exclusive at all
[3:14:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> is Rise coming to PC?
[3:14:06] <her0_89> locked at 30
[3:14:08] <+yoshkosh20> it's coming to pc? thank god
[3:14:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> apparently hh was originally based on capoeira so they made it more capoeira like, according to gaijin Hunter
[3:14:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> how does a guitar get dull?
[3:14:10] <%TheWinged7> both attacks + r
[3:14:10] <tanarath> @kaijuultimax It's running better on the switch than world
[3:14:11] <%d1stantutopia> Pat you can do Infernal Performance right after a Slide Beat
[3:14:12] <%kyh9> INFERNAL
[3:14:13] <her0_89> but its a stable 30
[3:14:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I didn't hear that at all
[3:14:18] <%kyh9> ZR
[3:14:21] <%d1stantutopia> And Slide Beat makes you immune to stun and knockback
[3:14:23] <UnfilteredComic> ZR + X once you have trio
[3:14:27] <T_Sasquatch> @shinobiphoenix Capcom leaks
[3:14:27] <+bugz_munny> lol those sounds
[3:14:32] <Zombrocom> He can only do infernal when his Meter is full
[3:14:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @ShinobiPhoenix Allegedly in October according to the ransomware leaks from last year
[3:14:33] <her0_89> @rumtumtugnutz gotta retune it so the right notes play
[3:14:40] <%TheWinged7> you need note trio
[3:14:42] <%Ynkubus_> Real slappy bass
[3:14:44] <%d1stantutopia> @PatStaresAt after Miracle Trio or Slide Beat
[3:14:50] <%TheWinged7> need RGB notes
[3:14:56] <%baka_sugoi> B A S S
[3:14:58] <UnfilteredComic> then ZR after tiro
[3:15:02] <+aWanderingKaivo> the literal basscannon
[3:15:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> @her0_89 But you don't use a whetstone to tune a guitar.
[3:15:17] <dan_g_v> ok that sounded actually good
[3:15:17] <%Blank9> slide beat is super armored too
[3:15:21] <Rawklobstah88> Slide Beat has Super Armor
[3:15:23] <%d1stantutopia> Yeah!
[3:15:30] <+bugz_munny> this is gonna be stupid broken
[3:15:34] <her0_89> @rumtumtugnutz uhhhhhh...cleaning blood and guts off of strings?
[3:15:34] <%d1stantutopia> Slide Beat has super armour, too, yeah
[3:15:40] <dan_g_v> was Khezu's or Giginox's the one that sounded like death metal?
[3:15:40] <+Grayhammatter> power up the bass cannon
[3:15:46] <%d1stantutopia> YEYEYE
[3:15:54] <%trustycoyote> Yup Slide Beat has super armor
[3:15:56] <Rawklobstah88> Barnd new weapon
[3:16:05] <%Blank9> earthshaker is huge damage, huge wire damage, and huge KO damage all at once
[3:16:07] <%d1stantutopia> Best weapon is now bester
[3:16:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so the leak / hack suggest Rise is coming to PC after time exclusivity?
[3:16:13] <dretpk> can see the talking getting annoying
[3:16:16] <%BoxNavy> hello bullfango
[3:16:19] <Zombrocom> BULLFANGO
[3:16:19] <%GinAndRoses> if this doesnt up HH popularity i dont know what will. blows my mind nobody played it before this
[3:16:20] <%d1stantutopia> LUL GET BULLFANGO'D
[3:16:21] <+Grayhammatter> hah, bullfango LUL
[3:16:21] <+gnoame> saved by mini monsters, just like regular MH
[3:16:26] <dan_g_v> bullfango no!
[3:16:38] <%d1stantutopia> >getting hit while performing
[3:16:41] <%d1stantutopia> Ah, some things never change
[3:16:44] <SCIENCE_25> Fuckin Bullfangos. Forgot about those little shits.
[3:16:44] <+bugz_munny> you move so fast now!
[3:16:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I would say "poor" Capcom, but they should have paid for better web security, but then again, they don't even want to do GGPO
[3:16:55] <%RetroCop87> I love how everything is Eastern Aesthetic, and then HERE'S A GODDAMN RATHALOS
[3:16:56] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[3:16:58] <Rawklobstah88> It just does a shit ton of damage, yeah
[3:16:59] <Rawklobstah88> IT's graet.
[3:17:01] <%kyh9> LEAD HIM TO THE MONSTER
[3:17:01] <%d1stantutopia> SO MUCH psaBig DMG
[3:17:03] <%Blank9> if you plug into the head, it does KO damage too
[3:17:04] <pilllowofbees> @ShinobiPhoenix if the leaks are to be believed probably
[3:17:07] <%baka_sugoi> MAI HOUCE
[3:17:12] <Zombrocom> DESTROYED THAT HOUSE
[3:17:14] <+aWanderingKaivo> oh shit destructible buildings
[3:17:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @ShinobiPhoenix That is indeed the case, though given that it hasn't officially been announced it's still subject to change
[3:17:15] <dan_g_v> house down!
[3:17:15] <%kyh9> HOLY SHIT
[3:17:21] <%kyh9> RESTRAINT
[3:17:22] <%d1stantutopia> THAT'S SO COOL
[3:17:23] <+Grayhammatter> you blew up my house
[3:17:25] <%kyh9> THIS SHIT IS JUST TITANFALL NOW
[3:17:28] <+gnoame> No need for flash bomb spam
[3:17:33] <%cylish> welp, maining dooter now
[3:17:33] <%d1stantutopia> BDSM RATH
[3:17:35] <dan_g_v> yeah the pull back down is so fun to watch
[3:17:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> right, hence the supposed leaks
[3:17:39] <xilmarinenx> Oh god. after playing MHW at 60FPS, I cant deal with this
[3:17:47] <+yoshkosh20> any new weapons this go around?
[3:17:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but Capcom is reacting to the leak with these new policies
[3:17:56] <+Grayhammatter> you fool
[3:17:57] <+bugz_munny> sallright its coming to PC
[3:17:58] <%d1stantutopia> Pat you can Slide Beat through roars
[3:17:58] <Rawklobstah88> Oh come on, it really isn't that bad.
[3:18:02] <Zombrocom> God I want a 60 FPS PC version so bad
[3:18:03] <Rawklobstah88> @xilmarinenx
[3:18:20] <%d1stantutopia> immunity to stuns and knockbacks, you can still eat shit
[3:18:30] <%Blank9> this runs better than what iceborne tanked mhw's performance to on my pc
[3:18:30] <+yoshkosh20> I'm impatient. so I'm prolly gonna get it on switch
[3:18:30] <her0_89> So how long until people datamine the full monster list from teh demo cause Devs never clean up demo files?
[3:18:35] <xilmarinenx> PC version? Not announced but mentioned on the leaks right?
[3:18:35] <+bugz_munny> theres no excuse for 30fps games anymore imo
[3:18:44] <+Grayhammatter> F
[3:18:54] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpSetIn got DOOTED
[3:18:56] <xilmarinenx> Well on switch there is an excuse, it cant handle it lol
[3:19:04] <dan_g_v> hee, that reminds me of the people whining that Monster Hunter should stay exclusive for PS 5 and not with Nintendo, because there has never been a MonHun for Nintendo and they don't deserve a real MH game
[3:19:08] <%WhereIsWill> you were going ham for a sec there
[3:19:14] <+fluxxiscool> @xilmarinenx yes pretty much, it isnt confirmed
[3:19:23] <$StrawberryPantsu> 6 Months
[3:19:23] <%FacetiousAF> BIG IF
[3:19:26] <+yoshkosh20> still a good looking game.
[3:19:27] <%baka_sugoi> but capccom
[3:19:28] <%d1stantutopia> nudge nudge wink wink
[3:19:30] <Rawklobstah88> 60 FPS would be nice, but really 30 FPS is fine.
[3:19:31] <@SoFarFetched> Think nintendo paid 6 million to have this as a timed exclusive for switch
[3:19:32] <$StrawberryPantsu> Apparently
[3:19:33] <her0_89> @Blank9 oh good, so its wasnt just me that had the game take a shit once Iceborne came out. Ran fine before
[3:19:40] <%Ranryu692> Pat says dont buy this on Switch because it's coming to real platforms, got it
[3:19:41] <+Grayhammatter> just get in there
[3:19:42] <UnfilteredComic> its perfect
[3:19:47] <+Grayhammatter> never stop going in
[3:19:48] <%d1stantutopia> I liked the weighty feel in World, but this looks so sick I can't wait to play it
[3:19:48] <%BoxNavy> hh's loop was really not fun and i liked the weapon
[3:19:49] <Decarcassor> Yeah, HH was super reliant on setup and positioning, which was tricky against the more agitated monsters
[3:19:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> i have no issue with 30fps
[3:19:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @dan_g_v Haven't there been more Nintendo MonHun games at this point than Playstation? LUL
[3:19:51] <%weissguard> It was kinda like that already in World, but not to this extent.
[3:19:53] <Rawklobstah88> Anyone who says 30 FPS isn't fine is being silly.
[3:19:53] <+Grayhammatter> never stop dooting
[3:19:55] <+Edrem> more hunting, less horn
[3:19:56] <%GinAndRoses> i liked that slow and steady rhythm but this seems fine too
[3:20:05] <+yoshkosh20> can you make your dog look like a giant husky?
[3:20:08] <%Blank9> it's now how HH was for everyone who learned HH but also ate shit a lot playing songs in monsters faces
[3:20:11] <%Blank9> the ideal way to play
[3:20:13] <T_Sasquatch> this is the only game that has ever made me want to get a switch
[3:20:13] <%Taisuru> Wait, is this being a timed exclusive just a rumor or confirmed?
[3:20:13] <dan_g_v> @Valentinius_Anodyne they have indeed!
[3:20:16] <%d1stantutopia> @Edrem more hunting, ALL horn
[3:20:19] <%Axellogic> Axellogic subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 11 month streak! You ever have one of those moments where the boss asks you to do something that you explain is unreasonable but they insist. Then hours later of doing task they get call you a liar for not being done yet. "You need to say itd be too hard b4-hand not lie"
[3:20:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so many games on PS4 RUNNING on PS5 are still 30
[3:20:24] <%SFdvus> just came from woolies stream whats happen'n
[3:20:27] <her0_89> Id rather have a stable 30 than an unstable 60
[3:20:32] <%BoxNavy> no more corner horning
[3:20:32] <+Zxtole> 30 fps is like eating plain boiled chicken, it's edible but it would sure be fucking better if it had more seasoning
[3:20:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> even on Performance Mode
[3:20:36] <+GomiGallery> 30fps is like.. unacceptable for next/new gen consoles like the PS5 and XSEX, but on the switch? if it's keeping a consistent 30 i cant be mad at it
[3:20:40] <%d1stantutopia> @PatStaresAt you can unsheathe straight into Self Improvement with ZR
[3:20:40] <%baka_sugoi> LUL flew away
[3:20:42] <Mangahero18> 30 FPS is fine...for games made 20 years ago. Games in the modern age need DEM GRAPHICS.
[3:20:43] <dan_g_v> for Cardio
[3:20:49] <%BoxNavy> achoo :)
[3:20:50] <RumiaTrain> Do you control the dogomaru or is it just like the tailriders?
[3:20:53] <%d1stantutopia> bless
[3:21:06] <%WhereIsWill> pat why is bloodborne still 30 fps on ps5 we need answers! LUL
[3:21:08] <Zombrocom> You have full dog control
[3:21:10] <dan_g_v> you control the doggo
[3:21:10] <+sund0wner> Oh bug wire
[3:21:12] <+Grayhammatter> YEET
[3:21:22] <+bugz_munny> Nintendo needs to stop being one generation behind in hardware every time
[3:21:30] <%SFdvus> dude this is like better looking then world
[3:21:38] <Heckerman87> When is this demo out for the rest of us normal plebs?
[3:21:39] <Rawklobstah88> I never understood why people get upset at games with a stable 30 FPS. Like. It's stable.
[3:21:45] <dan_g_v> yeah it's better than world
[3:21:48] <+Zxtole> Better looking than world LUL
[3:21:54] <UnfilteredComic> @Heckerman87 it out
[3:21:56] <+bugz_munny> lol
[3:21:58] <+seaearthandsky> @bugz_munny guess what, if they're making the money they want, they don't think they have to change shit
[3:21:58] <+bugz_munny> no
[3:22:02] <+sund0wner> Play them tunes on that monster's torsooooo
[3:22:03] <%SaiyanShoto> @shinobiphoenix well that’s because a lot of PS4 games are locked 30 so they can’t be boosted to 60
[3:22:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Eh, given that this is running on Switch if the 30 fps is consistent then it's fine. Stable framerate is less of a pain than a higher but unstable framerate
[3:22:09] <%d1stantutopia> More stylized than World, and stylized > realistic
[3:22:10] <+GomiGallery> this game is not better looking than world
[3:22:11] <her0_89> @Heckerman87 out now
[3:22:13] <+GomiGallery> cmon y'all
[3:22:13] <dan_g_v> I recall Max talking about the quality of life stuff over world and such, how fast it was and stuff
[3:22:18] <%Radioactivetaco9> the style looks much nicer than world but the actual foliage and stuff is nowhere near world
[3:22:20] <+GomiGallery> it looks great on the switch running at 30fps but come on
[3:22:25] <%Broand> Not sure about the voices calling out all the monster attacks for you
[3:22:26] <Heckerman87> @UnfilteredComic Really? Dang, better check again as I didn't see it in the store this morning. Thanks!
[3:22:27] <T_Sasquatch> @rawklobstah88 we should be past 30 fps. Raise your standards
[3:22:28] <%SFdvus> @Rawklobstah88 less time to see stuff to do quarter second maneuvers
[3:22:33] <%BoxNavy> this game is much better looking than world
[3:22:35] <Zombrocom> It looks nice for a switch game, but it does NOT look better than world come on
[3:22:37] <+bugz_munny> The environments look rough imo
[3:22:44] <UnfilteredComic> @Heckerman87 yeah dropped at about 5
[3:22:45] <%YakumoYomi> @Rawklobstah88 I don't get upset, but I definitely think "stable 60" should be the standard nowadays. Instead, the industry pushes higher resolutions and more post-processing effects.
[3:22:45] <+bugz_munny> empty and dark
[3:22:46] <%d1stantutopia> YEYEYE
[3:22:48] <%d1stantutopia> PERFECT
[3:22:50] <+GomiGallery> the artstyle is great and a fantastic way to adapt the world graphics for a less capable machine
[3:22:51] <+sund0wner> U bish
[3:22:51] <dan_g_v> that was badass
[3:22:52] <%BoxNavy> its easier on the eyes
[3:22:54] <%Blank9> oh man you can super armor through the roar
[3:22:58] <%d1stantutopia> HELL YEAH YOU CAN
[3:22:59] <%Blank9> fuck that's good
[3:23:01] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[3:23:04] <+gnoame> Flys away right as you use your stuff, yeah, that's a Rathian alright
[3:23:10] <Zombrocom> New HH is sick man
[3:23:14] <T_Sasquatch> If people hyped up 60fps more than graphics we'd have better games
[3:23:15] <%Axellogic> Did Pat mess with hammer at all yet?
[3:23:15] <%d1stantutopia> guys I am so happy with the new HH
[3:23:22] <+Wolverine101> How does horn feel in Rise?
[3:23:25] <%Axellogic> I just got here
[3:23:25] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Pat messed with hammer
[3:23:27] <+rnajed> ive never seen pat without the cube. he looks naked
[3:23:29] <her0_89> So what are the odds that red arrow is just for the demo and tons of people are gonna complain when its no there in the full game?
[3:23:29] <@SoFarFetched> He did a test of all the weapons
[3:23:30] <artificiallynatural> environmental design's less dense and packed but it's a much better environment for actual battles. less clutter
[3:23:30] <%d1stantutopia> @Axellogic Yeah
[3:23:31] <+bugz_munny> Like even fully lit, this area doesnt look great
[3:23:34] <%Taisuru> Monster hitboxes seem so much less obnoxious than world
[3:23:34] <Saltmeisterr> bE cAReFUl
[3:23:42] <+seaearthandsky> @T_Sasquatch for the switch, 30 is the best they can do for most games
[3:23:46] <%WhereIsWill> one of them switch pros if you will
[3:23:54] <%d1stantutopia> Poison ticks are faster
[3:23:55] <+KaijuUltimax> If only there was an upgraded Switch that could run this at a higher resolution and perhaps framerate
[3:23:57] <%AzureGale> Give us a NEW Switch
[3:23:59] <xeros720> bullfango puttin in work
[3:24:01] <%d1stantutopia> on monsters
[3:24:02] <Profmcstevie> Everyone thinks we'll get a Switch Pro, but that makes too much sense for Nintendo to do HahaThisisfine
[3:24:03] <%Jaller101514> its fine
[3:24:07] <darkdagon769> switch pro was leaked wasn't it
[3:24:08] <%Monkeyweed21> are Encores and Chain playing still in?
[3:24:09] <%SFdvus> i switched to hd years ago
[3:24:09] <Frozen_phoenix> I'd say poor bullfango... but it's a bullfango, they have no mercy
[3:24:14] <+Wolverine101> I'd rather it be locked 30 than inconsistent 45-60
[3:24:15] <%d1stantutopia> If only this game were allegedly coming to the PC, supposedly
[3:24:16] <%Axellogic> Was it much more fun with the changes or mostly the same? @d1stantutopia
[3:24:16] <+gnoame> one of them there super new switch xl pros
[3:24:21] <%Ranryu692> I wish they had started with a dual SKU Switch Pro/Lite, and then offered the combined one later
[3:24:24] <+KaijuUltimax> @darkdagon769 It's in the Switch firmware, it's happening
[3:24:25] <Zombrocom> That does so much damage actually.
[3:24:34] <Zombrocom> That was almost 300 damage all together
[3:24:43] <%SFdvus> id rather my game be a lock 120 fps
[3:24:47] <%d1stantutopia> @Axellogic I'm not a hammer player so I wouldn't really know in depth, but it has some cool new shit
[3:24:49] <dan_g_v> bubbles!
[3:24:50] <NocturneNovember> just tuning in, does the greatsword seem faster to anyone else looking at it?
[3:24:51] <T_Sasquatch> @seaearthandsky i know that. Nintendo makes banger exclusives so they get away with it
[3:24:51] <Mangahero18> Does the roll not have I-Frames or is pat just garbo at dodging?
[3:25:02] <NocturneNovember> or whatever that it
[3:25:04] <+bugz_munny> id rather 60 just be the standard now like it should be
[3:25:04] <darkdagon769> yeah i thought so, saw on the news about the rumoured specs and shiz
[3:25:06] <Rawklobstah88> Your regular attacks are dependant on forwards and backs
[3:25:09] <%d1stantutopia> Hammer is on the higher end of the "cool shit -> nothing" scale
[3:25:12] <%FacetiousAF> hehe rathian squirm
[3:25:12] <Rawklobstah88> I thiiiiiink you still have stab?
[3:25:14] <dan_g_v> can't use the training area in the demo?
[3:25:17] <Rawklobstah88> I never tried it
[3:25:23] <Zombrocom> The roll has TINY i frames, it's actually hard to i frame stuff in monhun
[3:25:27] <+Wolverine101> How long did it take for you to get the demo to download?
[3:25:31] <her0_89> no training area in the demo
[3:25:31] <%Radioactivetaco9> @Mangahero18 it has like 5 I frames so its hard to dodge through things
[3:25:32] <+sund0wner> d00d
[3:25:33] <%BoxNavy> doooood
[3:25:38] <%Monkeyweed21> are encores and chain performances still in?
[3:25:38] <%baka_sugoi> DOOD
[3:25:43] <%d1stantutopia> Pat do you still have the stab? Hold back during any attack except the first
[3:25:50] <hamborgini> shout outs to good internet
[3:25:52] <Saltmeisterr> maximillian if u will
[3:25:57] <+generalve> how the fuck is this running on a switch ?!
[3:25:58] <+Wolverine101> Okay because the Eshop isnt downloading anything right now
[3:25:59] <Zombrocom> Hi mizu, bye mizu
[3:26:00] <marklarphd> Demo download took 10-15 minutes
[3:26:04] <%d1stantutopia> YEAH
[3:26:04] <+TheotherKristian> You and your damn fast internet
[3:26:11] <%d1stantutopia> ty for checking, bless up
[3:26:11] <%Blank9> oh man, HH still able to cut tails
[3:26:11] <dan_g_v> I think some people will complain that's too many seconds
[3:26:13] <Frozen_phoenix> can turn down the vocal thing in the options to be less frequent I think
[3:26:15] <%BoxNavy> stabs not there anymore
[3:26:15] <Psyramics> I hope this vocal shit means the character talks during cutscenes, instead of just nodding at everyone
[3:26:16] <%baka_sugoi> you did a pole
[3:26:18] <%Blank9> just gotta tenderize them first
[3:26:19] <%baka_sugoi> poke
[3:26:24] <%d1stantutopia> HH TAIL CUTS CONFIRMED
[3:26:25] <Saltmeisterr> @Wolverine101 it was like that on crimble
[3:26:34] <Mangahero18> What do those annoying barks sound like if you set the voice language to the weird in-universe simmlish option I wonder?
[3:26:39] <%SFdvus> i got a air bnb had like 200 mbps downlad
[3:26:43] <%trustycoyote> @Frozen_phoenix You are correct
[3:26:45] <%BoxNavy> not for notes 2 and 3 anymway
[3:26:45] <Mangahero18> Do you just get your character barking random nonsense?
[3:26:47] <marklarphd> @Frozen_phoenix yes, there's a slider
[3:26:48] <LoneFonte> can you hear other hunters yells in mp?
[3:27:00] <+Over_ninek> someone is going to use the vocal queues to play this game blind folded
[3:27:03] <+Kilik_> I watched all the weapon trailers, seems like every weapon got cool stuff, except IG LUL
[3:27:10] <+Wolverine101> Thos voice lines are customizable in the full game
[3:27:14] <%BoxNavy> wait how do you get song of raging flame?
[3:27:14] <Rawklobstah88> It's Echo Waves in Iceborne, it's the smae deal
[3:27:20] <dan_g_v> yeah you can hear other players @LoneFonte
[3:27:21] <%Blank9> it does ridiculous damage if they're knocked over
[3:27:22] <%Cuon_Alpinus> BE CAREFUL!
[3:27:22] <%d1stantutopia> @Mangahero18 I imagine so, but in MP you'd have it subtitled on the side like in World. Or at least that's what I'd assume.
[3:27:29] <%Monkeyweed21> IG straight up lost moves lol
[3:27:31] <artificiallynatural> @Mangahero18 the characters call out monster attacks. it's pretty much an audio cue
[3:27:32] <Rawklobstah88> Using that spin attack @BoxNavy
[3:27:36] <%trustycoyote> I mean it is a super buff so I don't mind if the hurtbox is small LUL
[3:27:37] <%Blank9> don't forget you can do that other command grab
[3:27:39] <%XeroSigmaPrime> It amazing how great Rise looks on the RE engine considering its on the Switch
[3:27:41] <%YakumoYomi> The vocal cues are definitely going to help when the monster is attacking from off-screen
[3:27:45] <xeros720> kind of weird to see a lot of things people been asking for years presetn on the ui
[3:27:48] <%AzureGale> BE CAREFUL
[3:27:51] <+bugz_munny> even with vocals, pat cannot dodge the rathian tail flip
[3:27:56] <%d1stantutopia> Yeah, in Iceborne you'd just spam that right on the head when they were downed because it did so much stun
[3:28:02] <%baka_sugoi> EZ
[3:28:02] <highfivesquash> this runs on the switch thanks to rolling uploads, where the processor and ram are constantly uploading and downloading in a literal stream, so there is a SLIGHT input lag but everything is synced allowing for easily predictable needs of textures etc , most developers just go "oh we can't predict this lets just run some tests and then make everything load at once" but nintendo makes it so that it only uploads what it needs and saves locations etc making load times faster and faster as you play
[3:28:03] <dan_g_v> hee, I remember Max talking about how every weapon was like IG in this one
[3:28:03] <%charp35> HERE IT COMES
[3:28:04] <%Taisuru> The hitboxes on monster attacks being not complete dogshit like in world is making me the big penis
[3:28:08] <%Agami23> the fact that you can turn down the frequency is nice
[3:28:11] <NocturneNovember> how's character creation in tus?
[3:28:11] <%d1stantutopia> YEYEYEYE
[3:28:11] <her0_89> It is possible to turn down the voice callout frequency if you at all cared, but its not completely awful
[3:28:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The hunter voice also helps with online co-ordination despite language barriers.
[3:28:13] <dan_g_v> Max was flying all over the place with the Great Sword
[3:28:23] <NocturneNovember> *this
[3:28:28] <Heckerman87> Is the server flooded or something? I try to download and nothing happenes
[3:28:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If everyone is listening to their characters then you're all coordinated.
[3:28:30] <+fluxxiscool> should be able to change voice settings as well
[3:28:33] <dan_g_v> You can't change the character or armors in the demo @NocturneNovember
[3:28:41] <artificiallynatural> server is flooded yes
[3:28:41] <+Kilik_> @NocturneNovember everything is preset in demo
[3:28:41] <jumpyhugs> Voice pack mods would be fun if this were ever on PC
[3:28:54] <+Wolverine101> @heckerman87 Yeah, pretty much
[3:28:55] <%d1stantutopia> @jumpyhugs "if" LUL
[3:28:58] <+Kenidashi> Ooo that hitbox on the big downswing stays for a good time there.
[3:28:58] <her0_89> Oh she limpin
[3:28:59] <%Taisuru> RIP Earplugs
[3:28:59] <Rawklobstah88> It's SO good
[3:29:04] <%trustycoyote> @Heckerman87 I had to retry downloading before the download started. Try it again
[3:29:04] <%SFdvus> so this game is like the stadia
[3:29:05] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Aw she limpin'
[3:29:06] <%BoxNavy> is pat gonna abandon the greatsword :O
[3:29:11] <jumpyhugs> Macho Man: "LOOK OUT BROTHER"
[3:29:11] <dan_g_v> oh yeah , we are probably gonna get voice packs this time too with the crossover stuff
[3:29:14] <%d1stantutopia> HELL YEAH
[3:29:15] <Heckerman87> @Wolverine101 I guess I shouldn't be surprised
[3:29:16] <%GinAndRoses> birth of a HH main
[3:29:21] <%Axellogic> more options to not need plugs is great
[3:29:22] <%Arazien> What about earplugs?
[3:29:23] <purple_bagel> That hookshot bug thing fixes all my issues with monster hunter holy shit
[3:29:27] <pilllowofbees> never used them in the first place LUL
[3:29:32] <%Monkeyweed21> can you still do encores @PatStaresAt ?
[3:29:34] <%Taisuru> Blunt Weapon huh Kappa
[3:29:35] <%Blank9> yeahhhhh
[3:29:37] <%FacetiousAF> ISSA GOOD ONE
[3:29:40] <NocturneNovember> I might just go longsword like I did in MHW
[3:29:41] <%SFdvus> speaking of blunt of choice
[3:29:41] <dan_g_v> like, getting Dante's voices along with his armor and stuff
[3:29:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Im guessing theres no chance of seeing Rise outside of Switch tho
[3:29:49] <$StrawberryPantsu> HERE IT COMES
[3:29:52] <%d1stantutopia> @GinAndRoses I mean, Tsujimoto is one of us, and he wants more people to play his main, so it's no surprise they fucking JUICED HH
[3:29:54] <+Wolverine101> in before rolling through roars
[3:29:57] <Mangahero18> I cant wait for the next CSB where pat talks about becoming a HH Main.
[3:29:58] <her0_89> That did 3 attacks over 150. Holy shit.
[3:30:09] <%d1stantutopia> @XeroSigmaPrime PC version leaked but not officially confirmed
[3:30:12] <pilllowofbees> @XeroSigmaPrime there is a chance it will come to pc
[3:30:19] <Profmcstevie> Rolling through roars should still be a thing, always has been
[3:30:20] <+Zxtole> In the Capcom leaks we saw that Nintendo payed for timed exclusivity so we probably will get it elsewhere
[3:30:25] <%Blank9> goddamn
[3:30:30] <Zombrocom> It did three 150s because it hit three monsters
[3:30:32] <%d1stantutopia> SICK
[3:30:32] <+Over_ninek> holy shit
[3:30:33] <NocturneNovember> Am I crazy or do the heavy weapons swing faster
[3:30:34] <artificiallynatural> damn that hits hard
[3:30:34] <%baka_sugoi> FINALLY
[3:30:35] <%WhereIsWill> this DAMAGE tho!
[3:30:39] <+Kenidashi> Breakdance on those fools
[3:30:41] <PE4X> sick
[3:30:41] <her0_89> That one wirebug move is crazy strong
[3:30:41] <knight_of_sorrow> that's a lot of damage
[3:30:42] <marklarphd> p*gchamp
[3:30:44] <Mangahero18> Isnt there another MH game coming out soon? The turn based RPG or something?
[3:30:44] <hamborgini> UUGGHHH that soundwave thing is so sick!
[3:30:45] <xeros720> rip
[3:30:46] <%AzureGale> VICTORY ACHIEVED
[3:30:46] <+Over_ninek> NOTHIN PERSONAL
[3:30:47] <%d1stantutopia> NOTHIN PERSONNEL
[3:30:48] <+bugz_munny> nothing personal kid
[3:30:48] <purple_bagel> KomodoHype
[3:30:49] <Zombrocom> Nothing personnal
[3:30:49] <%Blank9> nothin personnel
[3:30:53] <Vulgar_Prophet> Nothing personel kid
[3:30:53] <AGRO_91> what a good ass weapon
[3:30:58] <AfternoonConcession> so does self improvement still get no bounce off?
[3:31:00] <%baka_sugoi> its psaBig psaBig damage
[3:31:03] <PE4X> what a poet
[3:31:04] <%SFdvus> dose that combo smack pat?
[3:31:05] <dan_g_v> easiest monster in the demo
[3:31:08] <kes009900> so which is best so far, dog or cat?
[3:31:08] <+Kilik_> HH hits different, ya know? FeelsAmazingMan
[3:31:09] <%Monkeyweed21> Wet Ass Patrick
[3:31:10] <Darkfire346> good doggo
[3:31:14] <pilllowofbees> @Mangahero18 yeah MH Stories 2 comes out summer
[3:31:14] <NocturneNovember> dragon weasel
[3:31:23] <%Blank9> this weapon slaps, and claps
[3:31:24] <%YakumoYomi> It's a "water fox", not a dragon
[3:31:30] <$StrawberryPantsu> He's already confirmed @PatStaresAt
[3:31:32] <Mangahero18> Was the first MH Stories any good?
[3:31:33] <her0_89> How long before a Deja Vu edit of Mizutsune doing its drift water gun?
[3:31:35] <$StrawberryPantsu> I think
[3:31:40] <%d1stantutopia> WHIFF
[3:31:40] <Zombrocom> Water Fox Dragon
[3:31:46] <%Ynkubus_> Skeleton =/= skin, you of all people should know that
[3:31:47] <%trustycoyote> Well we did get Lagi in Generations so maybe
[3:31:49] <%Blank9> mh stories is ok, not amazing but ok
[3:31:51] <Mangahero18> It was like a weird pokemon clone or something mixed with a JRPG right?
[3:31:53] <%Naho_Saenoki> @her0_89 It already exists.
[3:31:53] <%Monkeyweed21> its a shame we'll never get the best version of Lagiacrus, underwater Lagia
[3:31:54] <+Wolverine101> Give us proper Lagiacrus though. How about full in underwater siege of Abyssal Lagiacrus?
[3:31:59] <marklarphd> I want to see fluffy gammoth
[3:31:59] <powerprotoman> pat how did you forget the word skeleton
[3:32:01] <dan_g_v> how many leviathans you think we are gonna get?
[3:32:08] <+tetraes> I think mizutsune is just really fun to look at lol
[3:32:09] <%Axellogic> MH stories is okay I guess
[3:32:10] <Profmcstevie> On the one hand, yaay Lagiacrus. on the other hand, Lagiacrus subspecies LenaSweatFu
[3:32:14] <her0_89> well sheeeeeeit, I know what im looking up after this.
[3:32:14] <+Wolverine101> Lagi just isnt the same on land.
[3:32:18] <xeros720> i bet Lagi will be in, but will be later
[3:32:23] <Saltmeisterr> SKIN
[3:32:24] <pilllowofbees> @Mangahero18 dood that shit was my jam, i played it just as much as i did the main line games
[3:32:25] <%d1stantutopia> @tetraes more than World had LUL
[3:32:26] <hamborgini> skin
[3:32:26] <powerprotoman> skin
[3:32:26] <%moogleboy1984> Skin
[3:32:26] <artificiallynatural> skin
[3:32:29] <%Ynkubus_> SKIN
[3:32:29] <%YakumoYomi> Skin
[3:32:31] <%d1stantutopia> You said skin LUL
[3:32:32] <%Monkeyweed21> skin
[3:32:33] <%trustycoyote> You said skin but we got what you meant
[3:32:34] <NeroInfinite> skin
[3:32:39] <hamborgini> skinleton
[3:32:42] <dan_g_v> skinleton
[3:32:43] <KeiPrime> skineton?
[3:32:47] <Namillus> The animation rig
[3:32:47] <%Monkeyweed21> ooooh Skinman
[3:32:47] <dan_g_v> XD
[3:32:48] <UnsteadyFunk> I was a Gunlance/Lance main in World likely gonna stick with that
[3:32:50] <%YakumoYomi> Skrellington
[3:32:51] <Mangahero18> PAIGE IS ON HER WAY TO YELL AT YOU PAT.
[3:32:52] <xeros720> everyone in your household always means skeleton
[3:32:55] <%d1stantutopia> "they knew what I meant" wouldn't hold up in court, pat
[3:32:55] <+Wolverine101> Oh I have now doubt Lagi will be in, but land Lagi just isnt the same as real Lagi
[3:32:57] <%Monkeyweed21> villain in disguise
[3:33:02] <Zombrocom> Lookit em slide around, that's great
[3:33:02] <Grethe_B> I miss Gobul xD but ofc, I bet he won't be back anytime soon
[3:33:02] <her0_89> DEJA VU
[3:33:03] <maglebeast> Villian in disguise!
[3:33:06] <+Tonku_the_Red> The underwater combat may not have been popular, but the underwater elder dragon was amazing.
[3:33:09] <%d1stantutopia> @UnsteadyFunk Funlance got some cool shit in this!
[3:33:11] <Dragovus> If Pat says Skeleton too much he'll have to send Paige to horny jail
[3:33:12] <XelanArdel> multi track drifting dragon
[3:33:13] <%Blank9> DRIFT
[3:33:17] <hamborgini> bubble surfin'
[3:33:17] <powerprotoman> OoOoh Skinman
[3:33:20] <+yoshkosh20> can you play sick guitar solos with that thing?
[3:33:24] <+Dova573> I hope this means Astalos is in too
[3:33:25] <%d1stantutopia> MIRACLE TRIO IN THE FACE
[3:33:26] <UnsteadyFunk> Yes good, good
[3:33:28] <%Taisuru> MULTI SOAP DRIFTING
[3:33:30] <%d1stantutopia> YEYEYEYEYE
[3:33:30] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpOmg sbfpSetIn woolieGASM
[3:33:33] <%Monkeyweed21> @UnsteadyFunk I'm gonna really miss wyrmstake mine but regening sharpness is a good 2nd place
[3:33:35] <+Kenidashi> Drifting water stream is exactly how it should look, that's a bit terrifying in the best way.
[3:33:36] <+Dova573> but For REAL give me GORE
[3:33:41] <+Wolverine101> I am actually about to prep to fight Caedeus soon in 3U. I'm excited
[3:33:47] <Namillus> God if all the Fated Four are in Rise that would be SICK
[3:33:48] <%WhereIsWill> SOAP SHOES ARE BACK
[3:33:48] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeyeye, do that damage
[3:33:51] <%Agami23> it sucks that none of the monsters i want will ever comeback. give narkarkos
[3:33:55] <+InvisiblessedReptile> Wow this game looks good, and I was thinking I was free from playing MH
[3:33:57] <maglebeast> I hear talk the HH is way different in Rise. What did they change?
[3:34:00] <s1rcuit> do the red song buffs mean they're in effect or that he can't use them?
[3:34:00] <%FacetiousAF> gamers would multiple HH buffs stack with multiple HH players?
[3:34:06] <+GrayFox2510> I love that Mizutsune now drifts while doing the water jet.
[3:34:10] <hamborgini> EVERYTHING
[3:34:15] <$StrawberryPantsu> Everything
[3:34:18] <+KingZaffy> Hunting Horn is the best
[3:34:21] <%baka_sugoi> DAMAGE
[3:34:22] <Grethe_B> @Tonku_the_Red same! it was so exciting and tricky with the movements, but the monsters had some great designs
[3:34:23] <+KingZaffy> Holy shit it's so different
[3:34:25] <MrYoke> Hmm, let me coun... wait everything
[3:34:29] <+Grayhammatter> pretty much everything
[3:34:30] <%Blank9> no more recitals
[3:34:30] <%Ranryu692> Hunting Horn is dead. Long live Hunting Horn
[3:34:30] <+itsgundamu> HH is actually good solo
[3:34:31] <AfternoonConcession> does self improvement still not let you bounce off?
[3:34:33] <Namillus> Identical horn songs don't stack
[3:34:37] <%Blank9> new moves
[3:34:40] <%d1stantutopia> @FacetiousAF No, the same buffs don't stack. If you've got 2 HH in the party, try to hit as many different buffs between them as possible
[3:34:40] <Zombrocom> They changed literally everything. It's a new weapon.
[3:34:42] <Namillus> You need to bring a band with diverse instruments
[3:34:48] <+Grayhammatter> bubble feet are back!
[3:34:49] <+GrayFox2510> @FacetiousAF Unless they changed that, it shouldn't. Same-type buffs don't stack.
[3:34:50] <%Euphbugg> Bubble fight
[3:34:53] <+Dova573> SOFT AND WETI
[3:34:56] <+Dova573> weto
[3:35:07] <pilllowofbees> i you ant spot the differences then you are either blind, never seen it ever, or are a dirty LS user
[3:35:08] <%d1stantutopia> @AfternoonConcession pretty sure SI still prevents bouncing
[3:35:09] <her0_89> So far the old handlers voice has been the least annoying of the callouts
[3:35:10] <+Tonku_the_Red> It may be because I'm watching on my tiny phone screen, but this game is a friggin looker.
[3:35:12] <Zombrocom> You did actually
[3:35:16] <Kalcom> do u still get a better dodge with bubbles?
[3:35:19] <%d1stantutopia> SOFUTO ANDO UETTO
[3:35:22] <AfternoonConcession> tight
[3:35:22] <%baka_sugoi> doge the bubbles like the TOHUS
[3:35:30] <%codedoomboy> There better be devil nay cry 3 event with a certain devil arm for the hunting horn
[3:35:38] <Zombrocom> Hit the bomb badger LUL
[3:35:40] <+Greywyn00> is this the newest Nier boss
[3:35:45] <Rawklobstah88> Yup
[3:35:51] <+Grayhammatter> yes
[3:35:52] <%d1stantutopia> @codedoomboy DUDE. NEVAN HORN WOULD BE RAD
[3:35:53] <Rawklobstah88> Songs now play as soon as you play a double note
[3:35:54] <AfternoonConcession> i wonder if they got rid of horn maestro this time around and just let the buffs last longer
[3:35:57] <+KingZaffy> Just hitting the same note twice gives it to you. You don't need to perform it
[3:35:57] <xeros720> yeah, you need to do the recital for stuff to activate
[3:35:58] <maglebeast> @codedoomboy that would be amazing
[3:36:05] <Mangahero18> So, you know how in Worlds there was a megaman skin for your palico? What do you think the odds are on us getting a Rush armor set for the dogger in this game?
[3:36:13] <Namillus> And also your draw attack can be any button, which means you draw whichever note you want
[3:36:20] <%FacetiousAF> @Mangahero18 that'd be rad
[3:36:33] <+InvisiblessedReptile> @Mangahero18 Chances are not zero
[3:36:34] <%d1stantutopia> You can even draw into perform for Self Improvement!
[3:36:40] <Grethe_B> @Mangahero18 oh I hope they make it happen! I would love that
[3:36:44] <+Grayhammatter> bubble fox looking real crisp
[3:36:48] <+fluxxiscool> thats nutty
[3:36:49] <%Taisuru> Wait, so do you not have to play the songs any more?
[3:36:54] <her0_89> I guess hte encores are no longer a thing?
[3:36:55] <pilllowofbees> @Mangahero18 dood we are going to get some crazy collaborative shit
[3:36:56] <%YakumoYomi> Rush, Treble, and Amaterasu are all on the table as Palamute skins
[3:36:59] <Cyphereous> I still hope we get Prowler in Rise.
[3:37:00] <%Taisuru> SICK
[3:37:01] <+fluxxiscool> HH is wild
[3:37:04] <%ahzato> That combo was DISGUSTING
[3:37:12] <xeros720> oh wow
[3:37:15] <%ladomania> How is Charge blade
[3:37:20] <+Wolverine101> Wait, no performances?
[3:37:20] <%ahzato> Omg
[3:37:21] <T_Sasquatch> WAIT WHAT
[3:37:21] <lets_be_friendos> so HH is even better now? might give a try this time
[3:37:23] <%CapnClassix> Do they still apply to teammates?
[3:37:26] <dan_g_v> that soudns busted
[3:37:28] <%d1stantutopia> @Taisuru Most songs just play as soon as the notes are stacked. The only ones to play are Self Improvement, Miracle Trio and Infernal Perormance
[3:37:32] <%ahzato> Welp, guess I’m maining HH
[3:37:34] <+Greywyn00> They specifically said no Prowler in Rise, sorry
[3:37:34] <hamborgini> honestly, I didn't mind how it worked before. But let's be real, this is way better
[3:37:36] <pilllowofbees> @ladomania mostly the same
[3:37:37] <Zombrocom> Performences are supers now
[3:37:39] <%YakumoYomi> EL KABONG
[3:37:47] <therealtacopancakes> that sounds like crazy talk
[3:37:48] <Rawklobstah88> It's a bit finicky at times
[3:37:51] <%ladomania> good
[3:37:53] <%Agami23> bagpipe meter maybe?
[3:37:54] <%Blank9> gotta fill the circle gauge
[3:37:59] <%Agami23> right beside your notes
[3:38:01] <%Blank9> next to sharpness
[3:38:06] <%ladomania> CB is the perfect weapon
[3:38:12] <%d1stantutopia> SI just plays with the perform button and an empty stack, and you can draw into it. Miracle Trio is one of each note and Infernal is ZR after MT or Slide Beat
[3:38:25] <+Edrem> zr+ x when the left circle is full
[3:38:25] <+Greywyn00> S-S-STYLISH
[3:38:28] <Frozen_phoenix> the XR+X is when you've got all 3 notes lined up in any order
[3:38:29] <xeros720> ah, you're right, bagpipe meter
[3:38:29] <+Grayhammatter> jesus
[3:38:33] <%Blank9> no, there's a bagpipe meter between the notes and sharpness
[3:38:35] <Rawklobstah88> He's trying to play Triple Miracle, and I noticed that it sometimes doesn't want to come out
[3:38:36] <%WhereIsWill> pat crushin it with HH
[3:38:39] <Rawklobstah88> It's a bit inconsistnet
[3:38:40] <%Blank9> it fills as you hit
[3:38:43] <her0_89> But the circle drained when you did it...
[3:38:46] <XelanArdel> damn this is kinda making me sad I have to wait till march to play this
[3:38:54] <Rawklobstah88> @Blank9 He's not talking about that.
[3:38:57] <%Agami23> the circle is for the second pop
[3:38:59] <%RigmaRolle> PUPPO
[3:39:00] <Rawklobstah88> He's talking about Triple Miracle
[3:39:01] <Zombrocom> He can do the ZR+X anytime, the bagpipe gauge is for the spinning follow up
[3:39:01] <%d1stantutopia> ZR + X is for Miracle Trio, ZR on its own is for the circle and is after Miracle Trio
[3:39:05] <her0_89> ah
[3:39:09] <%trustycoyote> @XelanArdel Demo is out now
[3:39:10] <maglebeast> so you don't have to play the notes now, the songs just trigger as you hit the buttons? that does sound pretty different
[3:39:12] <xeros720> i see
[3:39:15] <%d1stantutopia> wtf was that bird
[3:39:15] <+Greywyn00> Doge with the iron ankles
[3:39:16] <+rbakervv> rbakervv subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[3:39:17] <Mangahero18> Hell we could even possibly see wilder crossover skins like Diamond Dog or Interceptor. Hell maybe we could get Koromaru! Id love a Shiba Inu as our dogger companion.
[3:39:18] <xeros720> i'll have to get at this tomorrow
[3:39:22] <Rawklobstah88> Guys, I'm telling you, right now
[3:39:28] <%Blank9> oh
[3:39:32] <+Greywyn00> have you already shown of IG?
[3:39:34] <Rawklobstah88> That when you try to press it sometimes it doesn't want to come out
[3:39:36] <%d1stantutopia> Woops, I was getting the name wrong
[3:39:36] <%Blank9> you need all 3 types of notes in your bar
[3:39:37] <+Greywyn00> off
[3:39:43] <%d1stantutopia> Miracle Trio sounds cooler tho
[3:39:56] <+Grayhammatter> yes?
[3:39:57] <Mangahero18> No...wait. IM calling it now, WOLF LINK AS NINTENDO EXCLUSIVE.
[3:40:01] <Frozen_phoenix> the notes can be in any order, it just has to be all 3
[3:40:03] <%d1stantutopia> @PatStaresAt You need all 3 notes but they can be in any order
[3:40:03] <+KingZaffy> It's any three different notes in any order.
[3:40:07] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Axolotl Weasel!
[3:40:09] <PE4X> the order is irrelevant
[3:40:14] <dan_g_v> how many turf wars have we seen?
[3:40:26] <xeros720> waiting for Amaterasu myself
[3:40:34] <%d1stantutopia> @dan_g_v None
[3:40:41] <Rawklobstah88> Yeah, I noticed it was a bit more reliable for me when I was able to combo into it
[3:40:44] <+Grayhammatter> then combo in?
[3:40:56] <Rawklobstah88> No
[3:40:58] <Rawklobstah88> Any order
[3:41:01] <+KingZaffy> No, it's in any order.
[3:41:02] <%Blank9> try it without a motion?
[3:41:03] <%trustycoyote> No
[3:41:04] <%d1stantutopia> NO
[3:41:07] <%d1stantutopia> Any order
[3:41:20] <+ShutUpAceyP> what is pat trying to do ?
[3:41:20] <+Invaderjaymz> how does the frame rate feel?
[3:41:24] <Rawklobstah88> Yeah, it comes out a lot more reliably in a combo
[3:41:33] <Rawklobstah88> It's VERY unsafe, but goddamn does it do a lot of work
[3:41:39] <xeros720> kind of like charge blade stuff
[3:41:42] <maglebeast> i'm digging the new battle theme
[3:41:45] <%SFdvus> hydro beam
[3:42:02] <%d1stantutopia> YEYEYEYE
[3:42:04] <+Greywyn00> Why is the cat not named crackers
[3:42:11] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeyeye
[3:42:18] <+tuchpi> holy smokes this monster looks siiick
[3:42:27] <BerryliciousDefinition> FUCK HIM UP
[3:42:37] <maglebeast> If they don't shout "I'm gonna take you for a ride" at some point i'll be sad
[3:42:37] <%d1stantutopia> Just spam health recovery and heal up your entire party nonstop, it's wild
[3:42:38] <+Kenidashi> beat that ass
[3:42:40] <Rawklobstah88> Miracle Trio, on top of hitting like a truck, gives you all three melodies at the same time
[3:42:41] <+Grayhammatter> FUCK HIM UP
[3:42:48] <+InvisiblessedReptile> Is there any slash atk with the HH? Like a slash skill, like there is one with the bow in MHGU?
[3:42:48] <UnsteadyFunk> I got so used to the hunter's claw it's going to feel weird not using it
[3:42:51] <snapplejax> Why does this game run like ass ;-;
[3:42:51] <Rawklobstah88> So for this, he gets Attack up, Defense up, and Health Recover (s)
[3:42:58] <%d1stantutopia> Magnificent Trio also triple buffs
[3:43:10] <Rawklobstah88> Game runs just fine
[3:43:19] <dan_g_v> just how much damage was that?
[3:43:20] <+InvisiblessedReptile> @snapplejax It runs like Monster Hunter
[3:43:24] <%d1stantutopia> MMMM THAT psaBig DMG ON EARTHSHAKER
[3:43:31] <dan_g_v> like, 400?
[3:43:35] <snapplejax> Not like PC monster hunter
[3:43:40] <%barrakuta371> This track reminds of Nier
[3:43:45] <he1lhydra> max was having so much trouble with this monster, what a world of difference experience has
[3:43:48] <snapplejax> more like 3ds monster hunter tri with too much shit on the screen
[3:43:50] <Rawklobstah88> Because it's not PC mosnter hunter
[3:43:51] <+Grayhammatter> well, that's PC monster hunter
[3:43:56] <artificiallynatural> then wait for the pc version
[3:44:00] <+Wolverine101> More like Ghost in the Shell than Nier
[3:44:03] <her0_89> God that wirebug attack does almost as much damage as a full charge GS slash
[3:44:07] <+Kilik_> Earthshaker seems to do more damage than GL wyvernfire
[3:44:08] <%SFdvus> its on switch a dude
[3:44:11] <Rawklobstah88> Ah, so you're just here to shit all over a new game because it's not old gmae. Got it @snapplejax
[3:44:14] <LoneFonte> is stable 30 that unplayable for some people?
[3:44:15] <AfternoonConcession> are we gonna get this on PC?
[3:44:15] <snapplejax> I'd take an uglier game that ran better tbh
[3:44:26] <xeros720> was wondering why this guy wasn't dead yet
[3:44:26] <Namillus> Did Max never play Generations?
[3:44:31] <Kaji04> did it yell in response to the monster limping?
[3:44:40] <Zombrocom> Max has only played world
[3:44:41] <dan_g_v> it seems to be more that the game is in Switch rather than on pc
[3:44:41] <%Blank9> max only played worlds
[3:44:44] <her0_89> Oh joy, back to the 30 fps convo we already had 3 times?
[3:44:44] <%d1stantutopia> @Rawklobstah88 NO NEW THING, MORE OLD THING, MAYBE OLD THING 2 BUT DEFINITELY NOT NEW THING UNLESS SURPRISE
[3:44:45] <artificiallynatural> Max started with world I think
[3:44:45] <Kalcom> world pepole being mad at new game
[3:44:47] <+kubozuka27> World was Max’s literal first and only game
[3:44:47] <+Wolverine101> @snapplejax Dude, it runs perfectly fine
[3:44:47] <Kalcom> lmao
[3:44:55] <+tetraes> I mean it runs well for the switch
[3:44:55] <XelanArdel> @barrakuta371 I was thinking the same thing about the music
[3:44:57] <+ninja_galt> oi oi oi
[3:44:58] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:45:00] <+Kilik_> HH is dope in this game
[3:45:00] <%d1stantutopia> HH is best weapon, that's why
[3:45:00] <AfternoonConcession> just gotta get good
[3:45:01] <jon651> time to MAIN HH
[3:45:02] <+Grayhammatter> get fucked
[3:45:03] <%Ranryu692> 2021 is weird
[3:45:05] <xeros720> buffs are pretty good
[3:45:08] <+Theblack0ni565> good old Monster Hunter this runs exactly as it should
[3:45:08] <her0_89> Careful what you say pat, you are on your last life.
[3:45:09] <Namillus> Hunting Horn has always been hella fun and it looks like it's now super sick
[3:45:09] <%d1stantutopia> oof, whiff
[3:45:14] <AfternoonConcession> welp
[3:45:15] <%Monkeyweed21> cuz GS sucks
[3:45:15] <snapplejax> Alright guys sorry I like to play my action games past movie framerates
[3:45:16] <dan_g_v> great sword noob weapon, HH true hunter experience
[3:45:17] <hamborgini> no good. only bad
[3:45:21] <Zombrocom> New HH is nuts
[3:45:22] <@SoFarFetched> Pat needs a party
[3:45:23] <marklarphd> Mizu is fast so GS is hard before you know the moveset
[3:45:25] <dan_g_v> it has Hunt in the name
[3:45:28] <%d1stantutopia> HH always has been and always will be the best weapon
[3:45:30] <%Monkeyweed21> you dont have a healer to adjust for your big number
[3:45:37] <xeros720> HH always had that effect of, "this was a lot easier before, why is it hard now?"
[3:45:40] <+vaderxyz1970> "The Bard is the best class in D&D and you can't change my mind!"
[3:45:42] <+ninja_galt> We need Jurassic Park so dino burgers can exist.
[3:45:44] <Rawklobstah88> Sound off HH mains
[3:45:46] <LVL1_Scumbag> but do it tho
[3:45:47] <Rawklobstah88> DOOT DOOT
[3:45:54] <%d1stantutopia> M-MASAKA, KANSEI DORIFUTO
[3:45:54] <her0_89> He has engaged hyper driffto!
[3:45:56] <+InvisiblessedReptile> @snapplejax So you have never played another Monster Hunter besides World?
[3:45:56] <%RigmaRolle> Hiya doggie
[3:46:00] <dan_g_v> red means good!
[3:46:03] <+gnoame> Rage Mizu blows bubbles with his metal scream
[3:46:07] <+Grayhammatter> hi doggie
[3:46:08] <+Wolverine101> Um, @snapplejax , you know that movies are at 24 fps right?
[3:46:10] <%baka_sugoi> psaDogchamp
[3:46:17] <Zeif00> Does that mean you're gonna pick up HH?
[3:46:19] <xeros720> yeah, deep enrage, i'd be trying to capture at this point if i had the option
[3:46:22] <AfternoonConcession> HH just makes monsters exhausted way easier so it was always super strong
[3:46:25] <snapplejax> I played tri 4u 3u and generations
[3:46:29] <dan_g_v> Snapple just doesn't like MonHun
[3:46:35] <Rawklobstah88> he angy
[3:46:35] <Saltmeisterr> The vocals remind me of Automata a bit
[3:46:36] <+Kenidashi> There's the spin to win
[3:46:43] <+Theblack0ni565> @snapplejax Then you should be used to this
[3:46:50] <%d1stantutopia> It looks like Infernal Performance only hits 3 times compared to Echo Note's 4
[3:46:52] <snapplejax> @Wolverine101 yeah that's why i said it
[3:46:54] <+Grayhammatter> caught sleeping
[3:46:54] <%Monkeyweed21> LUL
[3:46:55] <%GinAndRoses> doot pat doot harder
[3:46:55] <+Wolverine101> All of which ran at 30 fps. Even World can't hit 60 fps
[3:46:59] <snapplejax> 3u didn't play like this lmao
[3:47:00] <%d1stantutopia> But it does psaBig dmg and buff
[3:47:01] <+Grayhammatter> LUL

[3:47:24] <+Wolverine101> @snapplejax And this is locked at 30 fps. So your point is>?
[3:47:25] <+Kenidashi> I think that red bubble is Attack boost?
[3:47:26] <dariusclover> LUL
[3:47:26] <%baka_sugoi> psaBig woolieMIRIN
[3:47:27] <Rawklobstah88> Snapple, you are actually insane
[3:47:29] <%d1stantutopia> psaDogchamp <3 psaWink
[3:47:29] <AfternoonConcession> can world hit consistent 60 on PS5?
[3:47:29] <%Aydarkzero> nice
[3:47:30] <maglebeast> yeah yeah yeah yeah
[3:47:36] <+Grayhammatter> nicely done
[3:47:37] <null_vortex> can't believe people's eyes nowadays are getting worse and worse.
[3:47:37] <+InvisiblessedReptile> @snapplejax Rise looks like it runs better than these. I have also played them and this one is clearly a looker, not to mention the game being streamed online makes the quality worse
[3:47:38] <%WhereIsWill> yeyeye psaDab psaDab psaDab
[3:47:38] <her0_89> one more good hit should do...whelp just gonna not finish that message.

[3:48:32] <her0_89> Fun fact guys, Joycons are awful for this game.
[3:48:33] <Rawklobstah88> Then your switch is dumb, Snapple. Ran perfectly fine on mine, both docked and undocked.
[3:48:33] <+Kenidashi> Oh so you hold it for more damage, or let go for safety?
[3:48:33] <her0_89> Dont do it.
