[0:13:08] <$Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt are you not able to get a fan?
[0:13:08] <+BeezusHrist> AC systems need to have a vacuum inside them. You can't do it yourself. It requires a pro
[0:13:11] <@SSaryn> Yeah at over 75-90F, not great.
[0:13:12] <MayorRev> please dont die
[0:13:13] <%Bailey__gaming> @binary_fireball you mean nighttime?

[0:13:41] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Do you have a fireplace and has it's chimney been swept? @PatStaresAt not sure on montreals laws but in brossard you need to have it cleaned every year even if you don't use it.
[0:13:41] <+michingmallecho> That’s rough buddy
[0:13:47] <DesertPenguin> That helps, honestly

[0:14:53] <%Starotter70> Ah, Montreal
[0:14:54] <+Delenay> hope things are ok. ducts being so clogged that the ac stopped is werid but cats tho
[0:14:57] <$ringabal> Xenoblade is a single player MMO
[0:14:59] <Espio0> you might want to wear gloves for up to 72 hours now
[0:14:59] <%ElenaManetta> Your stores don't have a "no mask" ban thing?
[0:15:01] <socratetris> @pth88 nice, thank you XD
[0:15:02] <%alphonseisbest> People stopped caring
[0:15:02] <+lucaflowe> I can't wait to see Woolie talking to a picture of Elmo on the podcast
[0:15:04] <%afronooch> Yeah, masks have been all but forgotten in my state
[0:15:07] <+eanscrale> UUuuugghhhhguuuu that's infuriting
[0:15:10] <AmericanaRed> FRENCHIS 4Head
[0:15:11] <$Chatterbox1991> Quebecors gonna Quebecer?
[0:15:11] <wrightlight94> Yep people stopped caring
[0:15:11] <%Mendin> Are ya winnin (at Runeterra) yet son?
[0:15:13] <namisrot> no one understands proper mask wearing either
[0:15:14] <Valentinius_Anodyne> There are so many fucking idiots that go around without a mask here where I live, it's ridiculous
[0:15:17] <%ChrisPlaysThing> We've got it really really bad in Miontreal
[0:15:19] <%ElenaManetta> "no mask no entry" is mandatory here now
[0:15:20] <@SSaryn> Like, the fact people aren't wearing their masks out in general public, people need to be fucking shamed for it.
[0:15:21] <+Valask> London capKEK bus drivers dying all over
[0:15:21] <%Dapper_Cactuar> heyyo
[0:15:21] <+MoonObscure> he leap
[0:15:22] <namisrot> like if u take it off it's used and need washed/binned
[0:15:24] <%Jeemukun> mandotroy masks orders haven't really been a thing in canada
[0:15:24] <Futurecity10> Fuck the french
[0:15:28] <ha2ken> People care more about their own comfort and enjoyment than safety for all
[0:15:29] <%GabeSweetMan> Rural it is less necessary, but metro and urban areas it's crucial.
[0:15:31] <haitakaa> meanwhile Woolie is still doing lps LUL
[0:15:33] <+michingmallecho> Today I saw the stupid mail person without mask and gloves. IM IN NYC.
[0:15:34] <+Delenay> paige tho

[0:15:38] <%Coystick> Thank you Yoda
[0:15:40] <brian_peppers1> Shut up Pat you don't even go outside
[0:15:41] <socratetris> @futurecity10 French the fucked!
[0:15:45] <DesertPenguin> They say it's worse in North Montreal. Please tell me you're not near there
[0:15:47] <Timurine> Has pat given up?
[0:15:48] <%Typhaeon> Masks are there to prevent asymptomatic or otherwise ill people from transmitting as easily
[0:15:48] <%SaiyanShoto> Too many selfish people
[0:15:48] <%ChrisPlaysThing> and we're reopening the tatoo parlours and the hair dressers on the 15th
[0:15:49] <j0ustar> Can't upset those voters Pat
[0:15:49] <%Starotter70> psaPorgmo
[0:15:51] <WRFWD> Masks help a lot, especially because you can't always control distances.
[0:15:52] <+BeezusHrist> people can't, like, just chill and sacrifice for like 6 months. People used to make sacrifices for much longer
[0:15:53] <%YakumoYomi> It's more about dumbasses not rushing to the beach en masse as soon as restrictions are lifted.
[0:15:56] <%ElenaManetta> psaCanada
[0:15:57] <%afronooch> LUL
[0:15:57] <%Bailey__gaming> I always wear a mask even tho no one in the UK has said we should because they are idiot
[0:15:59] <brian_peppers1> it was a joke you bum
[0:15:59] <%alphonseisbest> yeah masks on in closed rooms is the proper thing to do
[0:15:59] <%DappercatEsquire> Agoraphobia?
[0:16:00] <%Diana869> i wonder
[0:16:03] <+Valask> capKEK
[0:16:03] <derap41> You didn't go outside before

[0:16:03] <+aeonhorizon> mind goblins
[0:16:04] <%GabeSweetMan> ESCAPE TO MOON
[0:16:04] <%sleepy_coffee> Don’t worry Pat over here me and my family are a little crazier, got spray bottles with water and bleach mix and alcohol wipes in the cars to decontaminate things
[0:16:05] <@SSaryn> Both is the easiest solution and it's as simple as just doing it.
[0:16:06] <olaksi> Was he french canadian, he didn't try to kiss you right? (I know nothing about canadian culture)
[0:16:07] <%ElenaManetta> If Pat keeps this Elmo pic up
[0:16:07] <%alphonseisbest> OCD?
[0:16:11] <%SomeSageAdvice> goddamn whats up with all this antagonism from the chat?
[0:16:12] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Because the outside is unsafe and dirty
[0:16:12] <+lucaflowe> Ya'll now Pat's less worried about himself and more worried about Paige
[0:16:12] <%ElenaManetta> I'm gonna keep thinking Pat is a VA for Elmo
[0:16:13] <Zulrez> because the sun burns your pale vampire like skin?
[0:16:14] <+xBolts4Lifex> you never went outside before though
[0:16:16] <%hotdough> Thanks for not being that kind of asshole Pat
[0:16:24] <%cylish> Yes it is more about social distancing but when you live with someone whos immune system is compromised you have to take every possible precaution guys
[0:16:27] <%ChrisPlaysThing> i haven't left my house in 70 days
[0:16:28] <Espio0> because of the goblins?
[0:16:29] <socratetris> Lupus and immunocompromised fuckery!
[0:16:30] <+blastazoid26> that's not the point guy
[0:16:37] <Byr0nX> beeg cat hours
[0:16:37] <peanutdot007> Outside is full of people and those things are morons
[0:16:40] <PanicSwytch> People don't understand that Paige can be compromised

[0:17:52] <Espio0> @michingmallecho here's the thing to, it actually varies, you can have Covid19 with little to no symptons, while on the other end of the spectrum it is excrutiating pain
[0:17:53] <DolbyFire> :)
[0:17:54] <%KnivesEve> thats not how that works! one guy

[0:18:16] <+BeezusHrist> @patstaresat because you will magically contract Covid from..... ether
[0:18:17] <%Typhaeon> The only argument is that if you aren't supplementing with Vitamin C & D, you are more susceptible to getting it later
[0:18:17] <%redrins> the disease goblins sneak into your house at night and spray disease goo on you while you sleep
[0:18:19] <%jackythefrost> Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is a fantastic game with a REALLY SLOW start
[0:18:21] <ShichiNoBushi> Ventilation, but that isn't a problem if no one's carrying the disease.
[0:18:21] <+RETROxRELOADED> Its in the wind
[0:18:22] <%DappercatEsquire> Germs gonna getcha

[0:20:07] <olaksi> The fact Pat talks for a living gives us awkward fucks hope
[0:20:07] <%ElenaManetta> This heat is making me think of people whose job it was to fan someone and I feel bad for those people who have been dead for hundreds to thousands of years
[0:20:08] <gordieda20> Aww yea time for REYN TIME

[0:20:22] <Kemmybelle> cat
[0:20:22] <TheLemuroid> You ever see the experiment where a guy shakes a hand then like 9 people wind up with fluorescent markers
[0:20:24] <whycans> at least make it to the beginning of the game, side-quests can wait if you make a separate save
[0:20:24] <+Pendlez> Pendlez subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[0:20:25] <danpc5> Maybe Elmos just wants to cudle

[0:20:36] <%Garthunox> @patstaresat what's your favourite episode/s of Avatar? my personal faves are the two Day of Black Sun episodes
[0:20:36] <%Coystick> Even the international Space Station is taking/has taken COVID precautions for the two dragon riders.
[0:20:37] <SubjectTea> @wrfwd I love the QOF improvements so much, makes side quests so much easier
[0:20:40] <@SSaryn> Isn't that like.. over 95F..?

[0:20:47] <%YakumoYomi> @albret__einstrong Naw, that was XC2. I don't remember the first Xenoblade being nearly as intrusive with the tutorials.
[0:20:52] <+geosspone> it's only like ~30C/80F here
[0:20:53] <j0ustar> that's my bread and butter right there

[0:21:15] <+chattychocobo> !uptime
[0:21:15] <%Daniel_Is_I> IT WAS GOOD FUCK YOU PAT
[0:21:16] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 21m 23s.
[0:21:17] <Kghaleon> XC2 was pretty trash, but I'm loving XC1.
[0:21:18] <Espio0> Space Covid LUL
[0:21:18] <%Starotter70> It's... ok
[0:21:18] <+Toblo1> Don't forget Xenoblade X
[0:21:19] <%Bailey__gaming> Elmo is too strong
[0:21:20] <%kyh9> It ended up being pretty good on the whole
[0:21:23] <%alphonseisbest> XENO 2 IS BAD GANG
[0:21:26] <%YakumoYomi> Xenosaga is fine. You're crazy, Pat.
[0:21:27] <j0ustar> what? xenosaga bad? you're pulling my leg
[0:21:29] <Bluewind098> You mean Torna?
[0:21:29] <%blastazoid26> Monolith devs were once square devs
[0:21:30] <SubjectTea> XCX IS HOT TRASH
[0:21:33] <$Chatterbox1991> Why was Xenoblade 2 bad?
[0:21:34] <+Toblo1> Xenoblade X was Just Kinda There
[0:21:35] <+RETROxRELOADED> Xenogears tho
[0:21:37] <%cvp5127> xc2 is great but that rng
[0:21:37] <haitakaa> 2 had a cool ending
[0:21:39] <olaksi> Xenosaga is just trash
[0:21:39] <%maenos2> man xenoblade 2 gave us nia, I don't give a shit I love my welsh catgirl
[0:21:39] <%sniffy77> That space launch was awesome
[0:21:40] <%alphonseisbest> XCX IS GREAT
[0:21:40] <%코코꾸라> XCX is the best
[0:21:40] <+chattychocobo> xenoblade x hard baited me into buying it
[0:21:40] <Kghaleon> Torna DLC is trash at the end.
[0:21:40] <Calek> I want to get XC Definitive but don't want to drop 85 bucks on it right now
[0:21:41] <SilverFaustX> xcx was good
[0:21:41] <%kyh9> @Chatterbox1991 Mostly a lack of poish
[0:21:41] <kekpek007> XC2 was one of the worst game i have ever played
[0:21:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> XC1 is personally my favorite game ever
[0:21:43] <%Starotter70> Mixed bag
[0:21:43] <+NitronStreams> Xenoblade X was there
[0:21:44] <WRFWD> I like Xenoblade 2 is ok, Torna The Golden Country was REALLY GOOD but very short
[0:21:44] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> Pat you didn’t finish 2
[0:21:44] <glass_marcus> Chronicles 2 is the most anime its ever been
[0:21:45] <%blastazoid26> "Xenoblade X was there"
[0:21:46] <mori_glaive> Xeno chronicles is amazing. X2 is hot trash. and X is just... meh
[0:21:47] <antshadow14> Blame nomura
[0:21:48] <+Remery_> But Xenosaga tho
[0:21:48] <%redrins> and X is still the best one, fight me
[0:21:49] <%skizzuto> XCX is good but its story is hot garbage
[0:21:50] <%alphonseisbest> XCX GANG
[0:21:50] <Onjani> X is cool
[0:21:50] <%Diana869> seems like its 70% miss
[0:21:50] <@SSaryn> And then we get, oh Xenogears 2 was supposed to be a thing
[0:21:51] <%GohanHitsugaya> Excuse me? The Xenosaga games are some of my favorite!
[0:21:52] <haitakaa> X also had a cool ending
[0:21:53] <theanora1> XBC2 is fine, but screw the fake loot box blade summons
[0:21:53] <PanicSwytch> Xenosaga series had some weird terminologies that made the story so confusing
[0:21:53] <%tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to haitakaa! They have given 241 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:21:54] <ktkat711> Nia carried 2, tbh
[0:21:55] <natertot1> XCX is rad tho
[0:21:56] <+Toblo1> Meanwhile Monolithsoft is literally built on the motto of "WE WANNA MAKE XENOGEARS 2, DAMNIT"
[0:21:57] <Scrub_Seeker> X was good
[0:22:00] <whycans> monolith didn't have internal character artist until late 2018
[0:22:01] <%kyh9> @Chatterbox1991 XB2 and XBX are actually on average better than XB1 but XB1 has by far the best storytelling
[0:22:03] <%alphonseisbest> XCX GANG REP!
[0:22:04] <+Dimfish> xenogears is good, blade is good, x2 is okayish, and the new epilogue game for xenoblade 1 is good
[0:22:06] <+pectusumbra> Take a deep breath
[0:22:06] <%za7az> Xenoblade X was actually really solid
[0:22:07] <+Remery_> XENOSAGAS
[0:22:08] <+michingmallecho> I’m waiting for xenoblade to get here Monday. It’s my first xeno game
[0:22:11] <SubjectTea> Apparently Torna dlc is good
[0:22:11] <+BeezusHrist> Xenoblade X plus Xenoblade Chronicles = Xenogears @patstaresat
[0:22:11] <apropos0fnothing> Xenoblade 2 is the Final Fantasy 5 of xenoblade.

[0:22:52] <%YakumoYomi> @kekpek007 I envy you, if Xenoblade 2 is one of the worst games you've played (because I've played real trash like Dragon's Lair NES).
[0:22:52] <ShichiNoBushi> I park in handicapped spaces while handicapped people make handicapped faces!
[0:22:53] <%Typhaeon> Or just put cube on hydraulic legs
[0:22:56] <tacomaster740> I am liking Xenoblade Chronicles 1 but the anime dialogue makes laugh a bit
[0:22:56] <@StridentSong> I'm banning SSaryn.

[0:23:38] <%skizzuto> fucking why?
[0:23:38] <%GohanHitsugaya> That's weird...
[0:23:39] <SupportWriter> You can demean XC2 as much as you want, but the fact of the matter is the worse Xeno game is Xenosaga 2
[0:23:40] <%Starotter70> Ooooooh
[0:23:40] <NeonBleu> mobile tax
[0:23:43] <%jackythefrost> Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is really good just not as good as 1 from what I hear

[0:24:02] <%Bailey__gaming> Scamz
[0:24:04] <+Valask> subs cost more in different regions maybe it's related to that
[0:24:05] <tacomaster740> you won't know if you sub on phone to pat Kappa
[0:24:07] <Jontman42> the internet tunes don't go in the phones so you gotta pay more
[0:24:08] <SonicD4> @doriancreed LUL
[0:24:09] <%Rancaliber_> Probably due to buying a sub through the respective app store.
[0:24:11] <+michingmallecho> I’d buy that for a dollar
[0:24:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> just sub on PC and save a dollarydoo
[0:24:13] <OkamiDude15> Gotta pay for a coin to sub. It costs 5.99
[0:24:19] <%mr_drucifer> i'm sure you've already answered this but what happened to the webcam footage?
[0:24:29] <%Movemeister> ...

[0:26:18] <%LaughingCatt> & that it did
[0:26:19] <+michingmallecho> If they port over the windwaker and twilight princess remasters then I’m throwing my in the trash
[0:26:19] <%cvp5127> i have 2 wii u's in my house .....
[0:26:22] <+EyeFarted> @PatStaresAt Please turn off RTX for a bit so we can hear the good boy scream.
[0:26:23] <SilverFaustX> it had a bad branding
[0:26:27] <%huskarl_zap> Wii u launch party ongoing
[0:26:28] <ppi1993> is it ryne time?
[0:26:28] <+Dimfish> remember nintendo land?
[0:26:30] <BoneofMalkav> A sign of things to come, a sad sign of things to come
[0:26:32] <%ToadKing> had some good gams tho
[0:26:32] <THELava_lad> at least it had some good games
[0:26:34] <%glgzephyr> !uptime
[0:26:35] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 26m 42s.
[0:26:36] <Djinnazz> Nerd!
[0:26:38] <ammobasket> That cat is portly
[0:26:41] <+endogreen> hello chat and Pat
[0:26:41] <PanicSwytch> I owned less than 15 games for the Wii U
[0:26:42] <@SSaryn> The Nintendo Switch is also poor but hey Splatoon 2 and XCX I guess.
[0:26:43] <%ElenaManetta> i thought the wii u was an extension
[0:26:44] <%Diana869> shame the switch has a bunch of little things that annoy me
[0:26:44] <%Coystick> The last time I camped out for something was for Halo4 and it dawned on me how fucking stupid it is to do, and I went home and went to sleep
[0:26:46] <%ElenaManetta> i didn't know it was a new console
[0:26:47] <%alphonseisbest> DEAD AIR
[0:26:48] <%glgzephyr> OH THE SOUND
[0:26:49] <+HugsTheGreat> I played XB2 for over 400 hours and I'm curious about XB:DE but it just doesn't look very interesting.
[0:26:50] <%YakumoYomi> Nintendo fucked up there. Apparently, having to render to two screens (TV and Gamepad) was a huge pain for devs and the reason a lot of them avoided it.
[0:26:50] <%Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat what do you think Sega's big announcement is?
[0:26:52] <SilverFaustX> it had alot
[0:26:52] <%heartlesshealer> wait, what happened?
[0:26:52] <%huskarl_zap> psaBig psa3guy
[0:26:54] <smuggleruncle> Pat Sweats At
[0:26:56] <Calek> and 5 of those good games are on switch
[0:26:56] <$Draylle> and now those are on Switch
[0:26:57] <%alphonseisbest> THOSE GAMES ARE TRAPPED
[0:26:59] <%Pengers> "had" being the key word there
[0:27:00] <%heartlesshealer> I just got here, what's dying?
[0:27:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> NOOOOOO STILL NO FUCKFACE
[0:27:00] <%GohanHitsugaya> Wasn't this one of them?
[0:27:00] <%kyh9> Wii U had a decent number of good exclusives
[0:27:02] <%TheotherKristian> Most good games are coming to switch
[0:27:03] <%fug74> Couldn't port games to the switch fast enough
[0:27:06] <%alphonseisbest> THEY MUST BE FREEED
[0:27:06] <%DappercatEsquire> GET THOSE GAMES OUT OF WII U JAIL
[0:27:08] <Kghaleon> Everybody bought it for Twilight princess
[0:27:09] <%huskarl_zap> Red sterl 2
[0:27:10] <%ElenaManetta> most of those games got pushed on the switch
[0:27:11] <%blastazoid26> More than the gameboy
[0:27:11] <+Dimfish> every console has SOME good games, like i can name a few good 3do games if i try hard
[0:27:12] <%MisterRockett> I'd bump it up to 10.
[0:27:13] <%grimmsean> grimmsean is gifting 2 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 2 in the channel! 
[0:27:13] <+Valask> KAWASHITAI
[0:27:13] <SilverFaustX> 10 atleast
[0:27:14] <%grimmsean> grimmsean gifted a Tier 1 sub to desusnack! 
[0:27:14] <%grimmsean> grimmsean gifted a Tier 1 sub to ReugaLive! 
[0:27:17] <+UberWolfman> Wonderful 101 is ported the console is dead
[0:27:20] <$Draylle> just need Pikmin 3 and SM3W
[0:27:21] <%glgzephyr> my patience was rewarded
[0:27:23] <%alphonseisbest> FREE THE WILL U GAMES GANG
[0:27:23] <%NWR_James> I'll pay for Xenoblade X and 3D World again
[0:27:24] <%MisterRockett> There are like, 3 games left.
[0:27:24] <WRFWD> The Switch still doesn't have Xenoblade Chronicles X, that game is still trapped on limbo
[0:27:25] <%Coystick> It's Virtual Boy 2
[0:27:25] <ristwach> Even #FE!
[0:27:25] <Calek> once 3D World is off the Wii U it's a dead system for me
[0:27:26] <+michingmallecho> It’s cool that you play ds games on wiiu
[0:27:27] <%heartlesshealer> But nintendo land
[0:27:28] <%Diana869> it still has windwaker HD i think?
[0:27:30] <@SSaryn> Like #FE. Which I think is not worth the 2nd playthrough.
[0:27:32] <%UvBenServed> SCREM
[0:27:32] <%huskarl_zap> psaElmo oow
[0:27:37] <ShichiNoBushi> Wonderful 101 is out and physical version comes out later in June.
[0:27:39] <ristwach> Which is ridiculous
[0:27:39] <%TheotherKristian> Pikmin 3 is the last fame I can think of that's stuck in wii u jail
[0:27:39] <Shonen_hero> they have escaped. Wonderful 101 has broken it's shackles
[0:27:40] <%YakumoYomi> Apparently the Switch port of W101 has performance issues?
[0:27:42] <%MisterRockett> Nintendo Land, Pikmin 3 and SMB3DW are left.

[0:28:46] <tacomaster740> cuz it doesn't matter
[0:28:48] <%LadyTheWanderer> even i don't know what the twin cities is
[0:28:49] <@commanderclaw> It's kinda part of the same city
[0:28:51] <%kyh9> It's the lesser of the two twins
[0:28:52] <$Chatterbox1991> Miniminminiminminiapolis
[0:28:54] <+prime_name> There are a lot of Pauls
[0:28:54] <SGrim> Because St. Paul isn't important
[0:28:56] <%jackythefrost> As much as I love Xenoblade Chronicles 2 I do gotta say Rex in the first half of the game has one of the worst character designs Ive ever seen in a JRPG
[0:28:57] <%Coystick> Saint Chad steals the limelight
[0:29:00] <%blastazoid26> cuz canadian

[0:29:05] <%Starotter70> Cause it has a dumb name
[0:29:06] <PanicSwytch> its the dumb brother
[0:29:06] <+Dimfish> St Paul is the the small city next door to Minneapolis
[0:29:08] <%ElenaManetta> it's the twin no one talks about
[0:29:10] <%Pendlez> americans expect you to know all of their places for some reason
[0:29:11] <ShichiNoBushi> The Danny Devito twin?
[0:29:11] <%Movemeister> It's the twin that gets eaten by the bigger twin
[0:29:12] <%historybowler89> St. Paul is the capital, but Minneapolis is the bigger one
[0:29:12] <%glgzephyr> it's a bunch of cities now
[0:29:17] <+HoopzBarkley91> I live in Minneapolis as well
[0:29:17] <%R3Roundabout> The troubles in America are starting up again.
[0:29:18] <%huskarl_zap> if you live in a city just put your hand in a blender and smash your nuts with a hammer
[0:29:23] <%Bane_Kaikyo> How can cities be twins? .... Cities are not born they are made over time
[0:29:24] <%afronooch> It's the Pat's brother to Pat Boivin

[0:31:25] <%Mendin> @Chatterbox1991 Like... 1.5-2 months ago, forest fires around Chernobyl and therefore radioactive debris thrown about from the heat
[0:31:28] <@StridentSong> Yea. My city had protests/mild rioting yesterday
[0:31:30] <%ElenaManetta> but i love flames

[0:31:35] <+MoonObscure> <...<
[0:31:39] <%Daniel_Is_I> Don't get your photo on top of the burning cop car
[0:31:39] <lyzejag> No burn it better
[0:31:40] <%cvp5127> dont pull aggro
[0:31:40] <+WaywardSera> No. Walk towards fire to make more fire
[0:31:41] <gade177> Don't kill anyone or burn down small businesses.
[0:31:41] <%Coystick> Start fires and walk towards them, got it
[0:31:42] <%ElenaManetta> just use your HD zoom on your phone
[0:31:42] <%glgzephyr> Chernobyl is not on fire again
[0:31:43] <%코코꾸라> But the light is so pretty...
[0:31:44] <+EyeFarted> @PatStaresAt Remember when the most feared thing in the news was CLOWNS??
[0:31:44] <%glgzephyr> the shell is fine
[0:31:45] <%Quigsies> Take the photo from reallll far away
[0:31:46] <Sotetsu> @gohanhitsugaya Twelve sounds an awful lot like twenty.
[0:31:49] <joelio475> Me : “laughs in New Zealand “
[0:31:50] <%GabeSweetMan> And don't aggro store owners who have guns.
[0:31:51] <%Mendin> It was on fire this year, not right now
[0:31:51] <$Chatterbox1991> @Mendin fucking yikes
[0:31:52] <%YakumoYomi> @ToadKing As a black man living in America, that is ironically close to what I picked up from black adults when I was a child.
[0:31:52] <%weissguard> Stay safe everybody.
[0:31:54] <1matheuw> dont walk into the boss aggro range
[0:31:54] <%GohanHitsugaya> Indeed
[0:31:54] <%Diana869> dont post images of your face at any protest
[0:31:55] <theanora1> But I want to get a free TV at Target
[0:31:55] <+Your_heals> @PatStaresAt Ok so set the fire and then take the photo?
[0:31:55] <%goose_attack_almanac> A monkey stole infected blood from an Indian research facility
[0:31:56] <%heartlesshealer> but fire warm and hot
[0:31:56] <@SSaryn> In fact, the cool photo might be destroyed the same way you might be, which will be bad.
[0:31:59] <SilverFaustX> use the zoom function
[0:31:59] <%za7az> It'll look sick at the funeral tho
[0:32:00] <trianglehat> ah the clown fad

[0:32:05] <wrightlight94> zentreClown zentreClown zentreClown zentreClown
[0:32:05] <%hotdough> years ago

[0:32:17] <%filialpails> the clowns were trying to warn us
[0:32:19] <%Diana869> that was like 5 years ago?
[0:32:19] <PanicSwytch> Yeah when It came out
[0:32:20] <%TheotherKristian> I think clowns are primary U.S. exclusive debuffs
[0:32:22] <trianglehat> spooky clowns staring at you on the streets
[0:32:23] <%grimmsean> the golden era of horror clowns being our biggest concern
[0:32:23] <%YakumoYomi> @goose_attack_almanac I heard about that shit. 2020 is WILDIN' out.
[0:32:25] <%afronooch> was that a U.S. exclusive?
[0:32:25] <SonicD4> I didnt but then the movie theater shooting popped up

[0:33:42] <smuggleruncle> the branching is pretty impactful - people die hard

[1:21:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> Perfect
[1:21:45] <%코코꾸라> turn it UP
[1:21:45] <FirearmsInstructor> @PatStaresAt It overwhelms you on crescendos, but is fairly well balanced.
[1:21:46] <madboaroffaerghus> How far did Pat reach in the original?
[1:21:46] <%bread_assassin> psaUp psaUp psaUp
[1:21:47] <yourwaifuispoop> this redone music fucking cums
[1:21:48] <%glgzephyr> Pat that man is doing EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD DO
[1:21:51] <olaksi> What's Yoko Shimomura up to these days? KH3 was mostly just remixes
[1:21:51] <dinnydanny777> Turn it up!!!
[1:21:53] <%MisterRockett> DID THAT SAY AUTO RUN!?
[1:21:53] <%vectorless_peon> fine audio
[1:21:53] <tactician0> LOUDER
[1:21:55] <RedTako> good
[1:21:58] <Misfit_Tempo> turn it up then down
[1:21:58] <marvel877> USE BLOSSOM DANCE
[1:21:58] <%manwithboxonhead> Imagine if he is the Protaginst
[1:21:59] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt It's an MMo format
[1:22:02] <Byr0nX> giv em the ol HANS one OR two
[1:22:02] <%GohanHitsugaya> Right
[1:22:02] <%happyface699> THIS MUSIC IS SUCK
[1:22:02] <%hzealot> Audio is out of sync
[1:22:03] <+CaptainJax> Crank that shit on stereo
[1:22:04] <%hzealot> @PatStaresAt
[1:22:04] <%happyface699> SICK
[1:22:04] <SupportWriter> Yoko only did a few songs
[1:22:06] <%skizzuto> it's literally a single player MMO
[1:22:11] <Bustahhwulf> wait the ugly conniving guy was playing to betray the hero? D:
[1:22:11] <%glgzephyr> it looks like FFXIV
[1:22:13] <CappuccinoGuil> It's a single player MMO
[1:22:14] <%templar010> Phantasy star
[1:22:14] <marvel877> You mean like it plays like FFXII.
[1:22:15] <%SilverDevilfish> It's FFXII but improved
[1:22:16] <%furiousfurioso> SourPls
[1:22:16] <%Starotter70> This game got me into FF14
[1:22:17] <+jiggy_snipe> that's what they wanted
[1:22:18] <%GabeSweetMan> FFXII??
[1:22:19] <olaksi> Less dodging though
[1:22:20] <%MisterRockett> It's not as good as FFXIV's gameplay.
[1:22:22] <%Bt_Robot> MMO mechanics are weird in a single player game
[1:22:24] <derap41> It might have been a failed mmo
[1:22:24] <SupportWriter> ACE+ did a large majority of it
[1:22:25] <tacostarvedbeast> that should be in your wheel house then, or does it just feel like a bad ff14 and thus u dont like it?
[1:22:25] <gordieda20> The time is Now
[1:22:25] <powerprotoman> xenoblades an mmo with out the baggage of being terrible
[1:22:26] <+Jake_Protagonist> they improved the Ui a LOT
[1:22:27] <%GohanHitsugaya> That's kinda one of my complaints about it.
[1:22:27] <ALTRNico> it's not an MMO if it's single player
[1:22:29] <+Dimfish> yeah this is superior ff12
[1:22:29] <FirearmsInstructor> Dude Elmo's fucking face is killing me LUL I keep forgetting and glance at it and crack up every few mins
[1:22:30] <%heartlesshealer> Phantasy Star Universe + FF14
[1:22:31] <+fetrigon> Still kinda disappointed by the combat :/
[1:22:33] <$WackyXmand> Dunband is totally a Shanks from One Piece type character
[1:22:34] <tactician0> Pull the enemies pat
[1:22:34] <+HiroTSK5> FFXII: ZA with premade characters
[1:22:34] <%cowardman93> playing 14 has definitely made me more open to this play style, I bounced hard off the 3DS version
[1:22:36] <dinnydanny777> Is it kind of like Star Ocean?
[1:22:38] <%happyface699> This music is great
[1:22:38] <%ultimatetotoro> whoa shit. this is like an mmo
[1:22:39] <+StooEsq> Battle is an Art
[1:22:40] <%huskarl_zap> nice hit flinch
[1:22:44] <jellssssss20> yooo
[1:22:44] <+solzan2000> not like star ocean
[1:22:47] <%GohanHitsugaya> That it plays like an MMO
[1:22:48] <%Starotter70> Cause it's not on a console that'll expllode
[1:22:52] <+jiggy_snipe> no star ocean is an action rpg
[1:22:52] <j0ustar> looks way shinier
[1:22:54] <SubjectTea> man i fucking love this game so much
[1:22:56] <SilverFaustX> i hated the wii mote controlls
[1:22:56] <%heartlesshealer> not sure if there's enough space opera for it to be like Star Ocean
[1:22:59] <%ultimatetotoro> this sorta reminds me of the ps2 dothack games actually
[1:23:00] <jellssssss20> i've never seen any of this game and it's pretty hype
[1:23:01] <+Golinvoxx> @PatStaresAt Compared due the old HD mod for pc emualtor how do you feel its stacks?
[1:23:05] <glass_marcus> moving while attacking is luxury after xc2

[1:23:22] <CappuccinoGuil> @zecht89 AGAINST THE ODDS
[1:23:24] <Byr0nX> moonrunes

[1:23:26] <%heartlesshealer> Star Ocean is closer to the Tales games
[1:23:29] <%skizzuto> not to mention this has a bunch of QoL improvements
[1:23:32] <KaliasTV> Those monado skill icons aren't great

[1:33:32] <%ElenaManetta> I kind of prefer it to the same American dub team I would normally hear
[1:33:34] <+chattychocobo> is it just me or do shulks hands look fucking massive

[1:33:45] <%glgzephyr> it's a hell of a lot better than LA voice actors putting on bad british accents

[1:33:49] <+Taisuru> There's nothing wrong with the Xenoblade 1 dub.
[1:33:54] <marvel877> @NitronStreams Because you're used to stronger, Hollywood accents maybe?
[1:33:54] <Kghaleon> This sounds like Lunar SSS music.
[1:34:04] <%happyface699> WHAT PAT
[1:34:04] <%croxeye> also man this game is low res huh

[1:34:17] <olaksi> I'll never stop laughing at American liberals being offended by offensive fake accents in games like this
[1:34:17] <%GarbageNirvana> From what I remember folks wanted Nintendo to release the UK dub here instead of delaying it further with another localization

[1:37:03] <$Dakuu75> wut???
[1:37:03] <Darren716> To respec!
[1:37:05] <%ToadKing> expert mode isn't so much a hard mode than a "choose your own level" mode
[1:37:05] <%maenos2> lol the fucking tutorial pictured
[1:37:06] <+Promessa_EX> make early game challenging
[1:37:07] <%Starotter70> In case you get TOO overleved @PatStaresAt
[1:37:08] <%Ninestempest> wtfffffff
[1:37:08] <%YakumoYomi> Ah, so like resting at inns in XC2?
[1:37:08] <+fetrigon> QoL
[1:37:09] <%ringabal> Big Boys
[1:37:09] <+alphonseisbest> HARD RUNS PAT
[1:37:10] <quietshun> To no be overleveled
[1:37:10] <%StaceMcGate> Prevent you from over leveling
[1:37:11] <WRFWD> The point is that it's very easy to be overleveled in this game
[1:37:12] <%glgzephyr> you can just respec whenever!?
[1:37:13] <Kghaleon> So that you don't massively level up and make the game piss easy.
[1:37:14] <SchlongKongEduardo> make it harder for yourself. and to avoid overleveling
[1:37:14] <Nameless0100> Basically, change your level whenever
[1:37:15] <%MisterRockett> PERFECT PARTY LEVELS
[1:37:15] <%blastazoid26> Making the game challenging
[1:37:17] <%moogleboy1984> Low level challenge
[1:37:17] <zecht89> limiting yourself pat
[1:37:18] <+CaptainJax> yo that sounds rad
[1:37:18] <j0ustar> ? level capping yourself for areas?
[1:37:18] <+alphonseisbest> LV PLAYTHROUGHS
[1:37:19] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt So you dont kill the boss in 8 hits because you did too many quests
[1:37:20] <vinnnyaraujo> so you dont make the game a cake walk
[1:37:22] <%MisterRockett> MAKE THEM ALL EVEN
[1:37:24] <%blastazoid26> Prevents overleveling
[1:37:25] <%moogleboy1984> same as the Firefly in FF12
[1:37:26] <%heartlesshealer> Expert is "level adjustment"
[1:37:26] <+fetrigon> BALANCE
[1:37:26] <%Lunaticbro > if it is like the original, at higher levels you get much less exp from basically everything
[1:37:27] <+Fnir> you level up too fast in the base game, it fixes it
[1:37:33] <Ultimatefool> Why would you not turn it on, you get the same EXP regardless
[1:37:33] <%valriot> psaBig Monado
[1:37:41] <gooeycentre> shulk must defeat brexit
[1:37:41] <%glgzephyr> @Lunaticbro so it's for grinding exp?
[1:37:42] <powerprotoman> it lets you make everyones level even apt as you always wanted
[1:37:58] <+CaptainJax> Shulk must save brexit
[1:38:01] <%grimmsean> seeing a pattern...
[1:38:02] <dinnydanny777> Can Shulk defeat Covid-19 before he defeats Brexit, pls
[1:38:03] <%heartlesshealer> Yeah Pat, it's for stuff like that
[1:38:04] <ALTRNico> grass Kreygasm
[1:38:09] <SchlongKongEduardo> maybe in person
[1:38:12] <%jkobe34> did you mean to leave expert on?
[1:38:14] <+alphonseisbest> U GET THE SAME IS JUST TAKES IT FOR LATER
[1:38:15] <%glgzephyr> WHY ARE WE DOING THIS
[1:38:15] <TheNumberJay42> pat overleveled thats a first
[1:38:16] <%Coystick> This is running on a Switch?
[1:38:18] <+HavenlessWF> The side quests are like 90% useless
[1:38:20] <%코코꾸라> NOW IT'S REYN TIME
[1:38:20] <SubjectTea> ive had barely any issue with framerate

[1:38:26] <BallerSwagBro9k> HE SAID IT
[1:38:27] <%happyface699> Very pretty
[1:38:28] <%heartlesshealer> This is running on a Switch
[1:38:28] <+solzan2000> yea switch
[1:38:29] <+NitronStreams> every time I hear a character talk in this game it somehow sounds like the most cartoonish accents I've ever heard.
[1:38:30] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @PatStaresAt how goes the expensive heroin addiction that is legends of runeterra?
[1:38:31] <ALTRNico> WE CAN DO IT

[1:38:45] <%maenos2> what else would this be running on besides a switch
[1:38:45] <tiaramaki> I CLAPPED
[1:38:46] <+blademaster247> Did Pat ever beat Dragon Quest 11 of Xenoblade Chronicles 2?
[1:38:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> IM REALLY FEELING IT
[1:38:48] <+alphonseisbest> YUP
[1:38:49] <Greywolf47> HE SAID IT
[1:38:51] <+reiface08> this game preceded 14 didn't it?
[1:38:52] <%GohanHitsugaya> But, all the side quests are busy work...
[1:38:52] <+MrBaldachin> this is what 1.0 XIV plays like
[1:39:06] <%Coystick> Uhhh I can see the LOD pop in on he grass 0/10
[1:39:07] <%valriot> This is the single player MMO for sure
[1:39:10] <zecht89> 14 is like xenoblade you mean
[1:39:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The game did indeed precede FF14
[1:39:18] <dinnydanny777> The combat looks really good
[1:39:19] <jellssssss20> Toggle
[1:39:26] <jellssssss20> Look at top right of that screen
[1:39:26] <RLT917> xenoblade is older that 14
[1:39:28] <%jkobe34> expert only gives xp from quest I think
[1:39:30] <%ZoltanBMagnus> you literally did it. How can you not understand
[1:39:33] <+MrBaldachin> I'M REALLY FEELING IT
[1:39:33] <WRFWD> You level up normally killing enemies
[1:39:33] <%cowardman93> god this game looks so fucking pretty!
[1:39:34] <%valriot> Dont tell him chat Kappa

[1:39:37] <SubjectTea> GET STUCK IN
[1:39:37] <%glgzephyr> ok so I just beat ARR in XIV, so I'm probably going to hold off on this game for a second
[1:39:37] <wannabemoogle> Reyn stop taunting me with your belly

[1:39:44] <%croxeye> so can you turn OFF combat dialogue?

[1:40:00] <%Daniel_Is_I> The new UI looks so great
[1:40:02] <tactician0> op already
[1:40:03] <SchlongKongEduardo> weapon models look great
[1:40:04] <+Dimfish> @croxeye why would you ever
[1:40:04] <Ultimatefool> Bunny had the GOOD SHIT
[1:40:06] <%Big_Dream> Streamer loot
[1:40:06] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:40:07] <%Starotter70> I wonder if they fixed some of the party memebers AI?
[1:40:08] <%glgzephyr> guess they all have to die now
[1:40:09] <katocrimson> where is the bunny hiding that weapon
[1:40:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> Where was that rabbit holding that...
[1:40:10] <OkamiDude15> you will live with the combat dialouge
[1:40:12] <Saltmeisterr> god the new ui is so good
[1:40:14] <+fetrigon> LUL
[1:40:14] <+ALazo> For the same reason you kill rats at the start of any rpg
[1:40:16] <marvel877> Pretty much, yeah.
[1:40:16] <%TheFramedWarlock> These weapons look stupid
[1:40:23] <%GohanHitsugaya> It does.
[1:40:25] <Kghaleon> So much better than XC2, we have characters that are actually likeable.
[1:40:25] <%blastazoid26> @croxeye Why? I like hearing IT'S REYN TIME millions of times
[1:40:25] <%happyface699> Dead bun
[1:40:27] <Pknesstorm> you still get EXP from battle in expert mode, but the quest and location Discovery exp is stored
[1:40:28] <SGrim> Jhocker
[1:40:28] <%코코꾸라> Are you feeling it, Pat?
[1:40:29] <+alphonseisbest> U MEAN OVER XC2?
[1:40:29] <+Benial17> What e buncha jokas
[1:40:30] <DamiexDW> Expert Mode just makes the leveling just like in XC2
[1:40:31] <%valriot> MAN WOT A BUNCHA JOKERS
[1:40:32] <+reiface08> this game needs a Fast Forward function/ faster running imo... after 12 hours in
[1:40:34] <%moogleboy1984> Almost as if it were a... Definitive Edition?
[1:40:34] <%croxeye> cuz i don't want to hear YA DUN for the millionth time in an hour :V
[1:40:37] <tactician0> if only 2 was this good :-(
[1:40:38] <Saltmeisterr> except JuJu
[1:40:40] <Saltmeisterr> fuck juj
[1:40:41] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> @Kghaleon oh be quiet

[1:40:51] <rampagingsoul> Man, what a bunch of jokers. LUL
[1:40:53] <dinnydanny777> If you aren't really feeling it what is the point
[1:40:54] <Ultimatefool> NEVER sell materials in this game
[1:40:55] <jellssssss20> Look at top right of expert mode screen @PatStaresAt
[1:40:56] <gordieda20> THINK YOU CAN TAKE ME
[1:40:56] <OkamiDude15> @croxeye its not as bad as XC2
[1:40:57] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> oh here come all the 2 haters
[1:40:57] <%Yukai_Yami> It’s like it’s a definitive version
[1:40:58] <Saltmeisterr> THINK U COULD TAKE ME
[1:40:58] <oldmemesdiehard> A definitive edition some may say
[1:40:59] <wannabemoogle> Feed the OCD
[1:40:59] <Futurecity10> because its a piece of shit
[1:40:59] <%glgzephyr> @Pknesstorm but what is the point of reserving exp besides challenge runs?
[1:41:00] <%Quigsies> 2 is fine, not as good as one
[1:41:03] <ValidVenasaur> same
[1:41:04] <%Daniel_Is_I> It ran fine....
[1:41:05] <%ringabal> What's great about Xenoblade collectibles is that you don't need a button to pick up items
[1:41:06] <+alphonseisbest> HOW FAR HAS PAT PLAYED?
[1:41:10] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> 2's combat is way better
[1:41:10] <quietshun> 2 is gud
[1:41:13] <%bread_assassin> I wasn
[1:41:15] <+Benial17> It was a pretty early switch game VS year 4
[1:41:17] <%radregice> i played xc2 and enjoyed it well enough but this game is infinitely better
[1:41:18] <vinnnyaraujo> I didnt realiaze i had this in the original until 70 hours into the game LUL LUL
[1:41:19] <%Starotter70> I thought XB2 was ok, but had a Myriad of Problems
[1:41:25] <%blastazoid26> I didn't like gacha mechanics of XC2
[1:41:28] <%코코꾸라> HE SAID IT
[1:41:30] <%bread_assassin> I wasn't a fan of all the gatcha Rare blades.
[1:41:30] <Espio0> @PatStaresAt it looks like you have to hand out levels manualy
[1:41:30] <dinnydanny777> He said it
[1:41:32] <%Daniel_Is_I> XC2 is still a good game
[1:41:32] <%valriot> This game still has some issues with the resolution, but 2 was like, laughable
[1:41:32] <+prime_name> i liked Torna more than 2
[1:41:36] <Futurecity10> XB2's probably is that it sold out
[1:41:37] <%ringabal> FEEL the POWER
[1:41:37] <doggieo> Oh good im not late
[1:41:40] <dinnydanny777> I CAN FEEL THE MONADO'S POWER
[1:41:40] <+chattychocobo> i didnt like it at all ngl
[1:41:42] <%MisterRockett> The combat in 2 still hasn't "clicked" for me 1's is a slot smoother and less damage spongey.
[1:41:42] <wannabemoogle> I couldn't over come the Anime tddy
[1:41:47] <%ToadKing> xb2 had a great combat system but you literally couldn't unlock the whole thing until the end of the game
[1:41:47] <yursty5> xenoblade chronicles X has Mechs
[1:41:49] <%GarbageNirvana> Not sure how I felt about 2's weird stand mechanic
[1:41:52] <%Lunaticbro > xbc2 has some problems, mostly (to me) the mercenary missions just being a needless time sink
[1:41:54] <Saltmeisterr> I heard torna is way better
[1:41:54] <%GohanHitsugaya> When you level up again, you start with the art that weakens them.
[1:41:58] <Kghaleon> I think all quest exp goes into reserve.
[1:41:59] <KingVantq> @Benial17 isnt the switch only 3 years old now?
[1:41:59] <%blastazoid26> I prefered Torna because of no gatcha
[1:42:01] <%ToadKing> i mean the final chapter starts with the last tutorial box of the game
[1:42:04] <WRFWD> Expert mode is only for quest and exploration EXP
[1:42:07] <+Dimfish> @yursty5 all xeno games do
[1:42:09] <%GarbageNirvana> And the whole gacha thing yeah
[1:42:11] <%valriot> XenoX was actually great. Also anyone who dosnt like Black Tar can fuck off
[1:42:15] <%MisterRockett> It seems like XC2 boosted the health values of enemies to shit because it wants to force you to do every single mechanic it has in every fight.
[1:42:18] <SubjectTea> They changed Alvis
[1:42:19] <%glgzephyr> wow this soundtrack is killer
[1:42:21] <vinnnyaraujo> look up pat,see the sky box
[1:42:21] <Futurecity10> XBX was a great game
[1:42:22] <%luckysteak> this music is very emotional for me
[1:42:28] <%GohanHitsugaya> Pick up everything Pat.
[1:42:30] <%코코꾸라> XENO X WAS GREAT
[1:42:30] <%maenos2> we're stuck on a whole different plan-et
[1:42:33] <%luckysteak> @valriot I agree with you!
[1:42:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It was flawed, but fun
[1:42:33] <marvel877> I like 2, but boy do I like 1 more than 2.
[1:42:34] <+lambdaze> I loved Xeno X
[1:42:35] <SubjectTea> THAT GAME SUCKED
[1:42:36] <%redrins> the game itself was great
[1:42:37] <+prime_name> I never played X
[1:42:38] <+alphonseisbest> XCX WAS GOOD PAT
[1:42:38] <SomersaultJustice> it was great tho
[1:42:38] <%glgzephyr> THE ENEMIES DON"T AUTO AGGRO YOU?
[1:42:41] <doggieo> Xeno X is a GEM
[1:42:41] <+Promessa_EX> good waifus
[1:42:43] <yursty5> Demo X has MECHS
[1:42:43] <%glgzephyr> THIS GAME IS THE BEST
[1:42:44] <$Draylle> it was annoying
[1:42:44] <%Ninestempest> it was flawed but pretty fun
[1:42:44] <WRFWD> XBX was great if you could read the menus
[1:42:44] <%WheatlyXT> This is making me want to buy the game again
[1:42:45] <zecht89> XENO X IS AMAZING
[1:42:45] <Greywolf47> FIGHT
[1:42:45] <Onjani> I'm on team good
[1:42:45] <%Daniel_Is_I> XCX took 20 hours to start getting good
[1:42:47] <bramblebird> XENO X GOOD
[1:42:47] <SchlongKongEduardo> i liked that game more than 2
[1:42:53] <+chattychocobo> i didnt like xenoblade X but the mechs was cool
[1:42:53] <CappuccinoGuil> @glgzephyr not all, only aggressive enemies
[1:42:53] <%DorianCreed> @PatStaresAt Expert mode is only for quest and location EXP, you can still level grind via brutal murder
[1:42:54] <Ultimatefool> @glgzephyr Not these low level bunnies
[1:42:55] <marvel877> As soon as I got the mech in X, I stopped caring.
[1:42:57] <Pknesstorm> it was great except for the horrible 0.5 point font
[1:42:57] <%luckysteak> It deserves a better system than the wii u!
[1:42:57] <%bendatron> yeah that suvked
[1:42:58] <%blastazoid26> @glgzephyr Some enemies dont aggro
[1:42:59] <%ringabal> Hey do you want to fill out EVERY SQUARE FOOT of map for completion?
[1:43:01] <%ToadKing> @glgzephyr they do later, this is just baby area
[1:43:01] <+alphonseisbest> THATS WHY ITS TRAPPED ON THE WII U,
[1:43:02] <SomersaultJustice> I liked x more that 1 and 2
[1:43:03] <Greywolf47> Pat vs Chat again
[1:43:04] <tactician0> Wii U was really ass
[1:43:06] <+chattychocobo> i played until i got the mech and stopped ngl
[1:43:08] <olaksi> I always take a grain of salt when someone says good things about a xeno game, they appeal to a very specific type
[1:43:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Nice
[1:43:10] <Futurecity10> XB1 > XBX > Literal fucking trash > shit > XB2
[1:43:11] <%glgzephyr> awww that's still good tho
[1:43:12] <+alphonseisbest> IT MUST BE FREED
[1:43:15] <+NitronStreams> Clap
[1:43:21] <+WaywardSera> wait when did this turn into an Animal Crossing Stream?
[1:43:22] <%Raiden_Breaker> I really wanted to like Xenoblade Chronicles X, but I fell off it early would this or 2 change my mind on the series?
[1:43:22] <$Ultradoom333> once Xeno 2's combat clicked i came to prefer it over 1 and X
[1:43:22] <%Emperor_Machinus> X was good, but unfortunately on the Wii U
[1:43:24] <OkamiDude15> @glgzephyr there are enemies who are docile untill you agro and some will agro if you within there vicinity
[1:43:25] <ne0bunny> XCX's story was a complete mess
[1:43:26] <%valriot> The gamepad sucked but it wasnt that distracting to me. Hoping they port it like this one.
[1:43:26] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> people hating on 2 now that this is out are stupud
[1:43:28] <zeif00> XenoX also had the worst fucking cliffhanger
[1:43:29] <%blastazoid26> psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:43:39] <%glgzephyr> @OkamiDude15 so it's well designed got it
[1:43:40] <SenranKaguraWeeb> 2s music was incredible
[1:43:43] <%Starotter70> This OST gives me the big cums
[1:43:43] <+alphonseisbest> XC2 SUCKS
[1:43:44] <Kghaleon> @AvoidingTheCoronaVirus 2 was stupid.
[1:43:47] <CappuccinoGuil> @Raiden_Breaker this will super change it, XB1 is amazing
[1:43:49] <SubjectTea> Alvis now has a new necklace to make it connect with the XC2 Torna story
[1:43:49] <+chattychocobo> i never liked xenoblade 2
[1:43:52] <+pectusumbra> To be fair 2 put gacha weirdness into just a regular-ass game. That's goofballs
[1:43:52] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Raiden_Breaker This and XC2 are very different games from XCX
[1:43:53] <+Benial17> Xeno X has some of the best song titles
[1:43:54] <%GohanHitsugaya> Time to start playing along.
[1:43:57] <%valriot> 2 is a good game it just looks like FUCKING ASS in so many areas
[1:43:59] <strifer413> the ost of 1 is still absolutely godly
[1:44:02] <%ringabal> pippip
[1:44:04] <Ultimatefool> I kinda miss the painted on faces, these look a bit too anime for me
[1:44:11] <+Dimfish> xc2s ost is VERY chrono trigger
[1:44:11] <%DaBigVitus> good bouy
[1:44:16] <dinnydanny777> Just pop down t' shops
[1:44:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Let us go to market
[1:44:17] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> @Ultimatefool Xeno has always been anime
[1:44:23] <Kghaleon> I don't know anyone that liked Rex and big jugs Pyra.
[1:44:23] <oldmemesdiehard> Beginning to remember how good this game is
[1:44:25] <oldmemesdiehard> Wow
[1:44:28] <%Ner234> Pat why LUL
[1:44:30] <dinnydanny777> I'm gonna pop tu tha shops
[1:44:31] <KingVantq> @valriot isnt 2 like 480p or some shit

[1:44:36] <%moogleboy1984> Spare 5 Quid fer dis hunk o scrap?
[1:44:37] <%MisterRockett> Remember Pat. Talk to EVERY TOWN NPC.
[1:44:39] <%luckysteak> just wait until you hear them pronounce "geyser"
[1:44:40] <Darren716> LUL it even warns about not doing everything
[1:44:40] <%Starotter70> psaGib
[1:44:41] <+bugz_munny> like john travolta in stalker
[1:44:44] <WRFWD> Trade is much better now, you can see every tradable item in the affinity chart
[1:44:45] <marvel877> If Pat's gonna be using that bull shit accent, then the Elmo picture should have a monocle and a top hat.
[1:44:47] <%glgzephyr> so I obviously completely missed this when it was released even though it was right up my alley. Gonna hop off the stream now to avoid further spoilers. Peace everybody
[1:44:47] <%ToadKing> pat plz
[1:44:49] <%Starotter70> Oi!
[1:44:50] <tactician0> never stop
[1:44:51] <%Ner234> Is Pat having a stroke?
[1:44:53] <Hellarussian> yep
[1:44:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Just waiting for Pat to implode into a crumpet
[1:44:53] <SubjectTea> Riki is gonna be like 20 hrs at the rate pat is going
[1:44:54] <%ringabal> NO KEEP GOING
[1:44:54] <OkamiDude15> NO KEEP DING THE VOICE
[1:44:55] <%valriot> I dont even dislike the voice shit in XC2 cos its endearing in how shitty it is. The fuckin "DONT FERGET ME" stuff was incredible
[1:45:01] <%Pappajimbo> accent seems to going all over the planet i think there was some mangled south african there
[1:45:01] <%psidefx> oi pat you up for a good jape?
[1:45:07] <+HavenlessWF> oh no, he went full retard
[1:45:14] <%OldManDeckardCain> jesus christ, pat's "accent" is even more inconsistent than that of that mad max actor LUL
[1:45:17] <zk_nails> evo19UK evo19UK evo19UK evo19UK evo19UK
[1:45:18] <+solzan2000> this game long asf

[1:45:33] <%Daniel_Is_I> Words, Pat.
[1:45:36] <+NitronStreams> Pat I want 30 minutes straight of just you trying to do a british accent
[1:45:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @valriot That particular voiceline made me laugh every time they said it, it was great
[1:45:37] <Hellarussian> Pats one sandwich short of a picnic
[1:45:38] <madboaroffaerghus> READ 100
[1:45:43] <+fetrigon> Pat...
[1:45:46] <%vaporousTippler> The problem is his Canadian brain tries to add u's to every word.
[1:45:50] <%glgzephyr> what are words
[1:45:52] <ingvarbergman> this is why i hate modern jrpgs
[1:45:55] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> pat had a stroke
[1:46:01] <olaksi> What are you ppl talking about , Pat's british accent is perfect
[1:46:02] <%valriot> Its an MMO jump
[1:46:02] <dinnydanny777> It's like a launch jump
[1:46:03] <ingvarbergman> so much tutorial just for navigating UI
[1:46:03] <mcmuffin69_> that cats face disturbs me
[1:46:05] <%glgzephyr> NO DI
[1:46:06] <SubjectTea> @AvoidingTheCoronaVirus and they even have the blue orb things tracked with ! which makes gathering quests so much easier
[1:46:08] <%Movemeister> I demand that you listen to all their different jump sounds
[1:46:08] <derap41> Its a castlevania jump
[1:46:10] <%happyface699> Words

[1:46:26] <Bluewind098> i love how stiff jumps are in this game that they even replicate Shulk's stiff jump in Smash
[1:46:27] <Kghaleon> Be careful, with all the money you have you can literally buy armor that makes you near invincible at this point
[1:46:29] <SubjectTea> GET THOSE NIPS OUT

[1:46:59] <WRFWD> Anything any character has will be available for everyone
[1:47:08] <%GohanHitsugaya> Naked Shulk now!
[1:47:12] <Nameless0100> This game really did well with QoL
[1:47:13] <dinnydanny777> Having Shulk be anything but shirtless is cowardly
[1:47:16] <Nameless0100> So far
[1:47:18] <+fetrigon> @subjecttea LUL
[1:47:22] <Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> You can tell Pat dressed himself, and is color blind.
[1:47:30] <SubjectTea> @PatStaresAt it auto saves so you dont really need to save to often
[1:47:31] <vinnnyaraujo> naked shulk is canon shulk comfirmed
[1:47:37] <%Starotter70> It BEGINS

[1:47:47] <%ringabal> Oh god psaGoblin
[1:47:51] <NJigglypuff> it would be BDF
[1:47:53] <olaksi> No one likes dorothy
[1:47:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I really like the glamour system in the remake, some clothing gets very silly looking, especially if you have mixed sets
[1:47:56] <%valriot> I still cant believe they added this in the gam
[1:47:59] <%Movemeister> oh this will be fun with the gobbos
[1:48:02] <dinnydanny777> Did she just swing her foot like an anime tsundere?
[1:48:09] <+alphonseisbest> did pat even look at the settings#?
[1:48:10] <Saltmeisterr> anyone else think Homs sounds like a racial slur?
[1:48:17] <olaksi> Homies
[1:48:19] <+alphonseisbest> not really
[1:48:25] <%valriot> @Saltmeisterr All those homs acting like thugs
[1:48:32] <katocrimson> xenoblade harem
[1:48:35] <dinnydanny777> We should all start calling each other "Homos" imo
[1:48:36] <%psidefx> psaBig GAME
[1:48:36] <%ringabal> DO YOU LIKE SOCIAL LINKS wait not that much
[1:48:38] <vinnnyaraujo> homs are like homies,all homs are bros
[1:48:44] <+Jake_Protagonist> I adore that
[1:48:46] <+rednecked__crake> fun yyjBloodTrail
[1:48:47] <Ultimatefool> This game has SO MUCH SHIT, how did they even fit it on a Wii disc
[1:48:48] <%Yukai_Yami> It’s only a slur if a mechon says it
[1:48:48] <%Movemeister> homs lootin leads to homs shootin
[1:48:48] <+Jake_Protagonist> "It's fun give it a try"
[1:48:49] <dinnydanny777> You don't just call your friends your "Homos"?
[1:48:49] <SubjectTea> @Saltmeisterr it sounds like a super short slang for homosapian
[1:48:52] <OkamiDude15> oh thank god
[1:48:57] <+Taisuru> Do you like getting stories for TONS OF NPCs?
[1:48:58] <dinnydanny777> Don't we all call each other Homos?
[1:49:11] <+Promessa_EX> small headed child
[1:49:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Homs is as much of a slur as Beorc is Kappa
[1:49:16] <%valriot> The fast travel in this game gives me the big penis. Actual magic.
[1:49:20] <+Promessa_EX> minature adult
[1:49:21] <olaksi> You look super good in those shorts, no hooms

[1:49:49] <madboaroffaerghus> Look in the window
[1:49:51] <dinnydanny777> This game gives off a very pleasant vibe
[1:49:52] <zecht89> shitty excuse pat
[1:49:56] <%ringabal> "Honey, that Monado boy is moonwalking against the door again."
[1:49:58] <OkamiDude15> fiora making the sandwiches that shulk REFUSES to eat
[1:49:58] <+alphonseisbest> this better writtien then all the Trails games COMBINED I SAID IT
[1:50:06] <IrateRapScallion> I personally turned off the minimap guide path. It ruins exploration for me
[1:50:10] <%Daniel_Is_I> I forgot how good the Colony 9 music is
[1:50:13] <%bread_assassin> It's fine here because there's no hidden sidequests like the earlier Trails games.
[1:50:27] <%ringabal> Eat the bigger one to grow strong
[1:50:38] <%Starotter70> I let my children KNOW who's my favorite
[1:50:40] <dinnydanny777> The text reminds me of Sonic Unleashed
[1:50:51] <ShichiNoBushi> Biscuits or cookies?
[1:50:51] <dinnydanny777> I don't know if that's good
[1:50:54] <tactician0> man my legs are crap and I'm not even old yet
[1:50:55] <SubjectTea> i love how peaceful the music is

[1:51:07] <%bread_assassin> That said, boy howdy, they should've cooled it with the # of sidequests this game has.
[1:51:13] <%ZoltanBMagnus> I saw bikini top to buy
[1:51:14] <OkamiDude15> @Daniel_Is_I they redid the music tracks for this game. you i think you can swap out which versions you want to hear in game whether it be the redone or original track
[1:51:19] <%redrins> thats some good early armor
[1:51:21] <CappuccinoGuil> EXCUSE ME DID HE HAVE 10K???
[1:51:22] <Ultimatefool> 100k? Do you get a bonus or something in this?
[1:51:25] <+alphonseisbest> DONT
[1:51:29] <+HavenlessWF> Mr Shopman
[1:51:31] <dinnydanny777> I'm guessing biscuits are UK biscuits and not the American biscuits?
[1:51:32] <CappuccinoGuil> WAHT 100K WHAT THE FUCK
[1:51:32] <%ZoltanBMagnus> You get money for playing XC2
[1:51:34] <%Quigsies> Yeah, XC2 save data gives money
[1:51:37] <%luckysteak> Pat confirmed to have played Xenoblade 2
[1:51:38] <%ShawnTK_> @Ultimatefool If you have XB2 save data
[1:51:38] <WRFWD> Equipment you can sell, materials you can trade, you need trade to complete the collectopaedia
[1:51:40] <Darren716> Yeah if you have XC2 save data you get 100k for free
[1:51:41] <+alphonseisbest> U NEED THEM FOR THE COLLECTOPIDA PAT!
[1:51:42] <%Yukai_Yami> U get bonus money for having XB2 data
[1:51:43] <SubjectTea> @Ultimatefool if you played XC2 at all you get 100k
[1:51:53] <vinnnyaraujo> having a save for xeno 2 give a 100k
[1:52:05] <zecht89> @Ultimatefool yup, xb2 sav2file
[1:52:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> At least the 100K is optional though
[1:52:14] <%bread_assassin> Fun Fact: You can buy the armor from the shop then just reload a save to get it's appearance data available for use.
[1:52:19] <%luckysteak> you don't need to, but it speeds up the process
[1:52:23] <%코코꾸라> D:
[1:52:31] <WRFWD> There are collectables that you CAN'T find, you need to trade, but not many
[1:52:38] <olaksi> Wait, this game has glamours?
[1:52:43] <%ShawnTK_> yep
[1:52:44] <%Starotter70> Sometimes, you do need to trade for Collectibles
[1:52:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @olaksi Added in the remake, yeah
[1:52:53] <SubjectTea> change time to night
[1:52:56] <dinnydanny777> Bring her Grandson those Rich Teas Pat
[1:52:58] <IrateRapScallion> it's a nighttime target
[1:52:58] <%Dr00_PhD> or just fast forward
[1:53:02] <Ultimatefool> Wow this is so much better. You couldn't even make quests active in the original
[1:53:03] <+HiroTSK5> All the named people have schedules
[1:53:05] <Kghaleon> lol boss creature
[1:53:06] <+gutlesscoward> just murder a bird
[1:53:07] <+rednecked__crake> Not murder, "defeat"
[1:53:08] <dinnydanny777> Make sure her grandson gets his bourbons
[1:53:08] <BallerSwagBro9k> BIRD UP
[1:53:14] <LorcaNomad> just got here, are ya feelin' it Mr. Boivin?
[1:53:19] <olaksi> @Valentinius_Anodyne *need to play and look sexy intensifies*
[1:53:20] <Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> You've changed, Pat. I don't even recognize you anymore.
[1:53:28] <Greywolf47> defeat is just another word for murder
[1:53:30] <dinnydanny777> Woah what a leap
[1:53:31] <WRFWD> Unnamed NPCs give generic quests for money, named NPCs give other kind of quests and give experience
[1:53:40] <WRFWD> Almost always
[1:53:43] <dinnydanny777> If you get defeated you may as well be dead, let's be real here
[1:53:46] <%Starotter70> NOPON
[1:53:47] <%ringabal> NYEH
[1:53:51] <Saltmeisterr> YE NOPON
[1:53:51] <+alphonseisbest> @ PAT how much of XC1 Do u know?
[1:53:57] <CappuccinoGuil> NOPONS FUCK YES
[1:53:57] <%scrumbotime> I fuckin' love those stupid potato monsters
[1:53:59] <CappuccinoGuil> THEY ARE SO FLUFFY
[1:54:02] <Futurecity10> Nopons are great
[1:54:03] <%Nupinoop296> they're so CUTE
[1:54:08] <Zombrocom> I hate them
[1:54:10] <%ringabal> Even better if they have a tiny hat
[1:54:10] <%DaBigVitus> i think this game is TOO japanese
[1:54:11] <j0ustar> M E H
[1:54:12] <+spottedwolf10> Did Pat finally get transmuted with Elmo PogChamp
[1:54:12] <+Casual_Nopon> NOPON ARE THE BEST
[1:54:13] <danpc5> they are better than the xenogears one
[1:54:14] <SubjectTea> I FUCKING HATED THE NOPON IN XCX
[1:54:14] <Vivirmos> Chonk moogles
[1:54:15] <%Starotter70> Nopon are also fucking Vicious and I love it
[1:54:17] <+alphonseisbest> this game has the BEST ONE
[1:54:22] <theanora1> Riki is THE BEST mascot character
[1:54:25] <SomersaultJustice> I like their lore quest in xc2
[1:54:25] <olaksi> Nopon is a palindrome, clearly an evil satanic species
[1:54:26] <%redrins> so not much
[1:54:28] <%SilverDevilfish> Chu Chu v2
[1:54:28] <madboaroffaerghus> Its weird hearing pat say he likes nopon
[1:54:29] <CappuccinoGuil> @Nupinoop296 THEY ARE ALL SUCH HUNGRY BITCHES THO
[1:54:29] <%ShawnTK_> Melia Smellia
[1:54:29] <%bread_assassin> I think that if they were all wiped out during a Xenoblade 3, that wouldn't be bad.
[1:54:30] <Snookasaurus> so 20%
[1:54:30] <+reiface08> melia what a cutie
[1:54:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> So don't spoil shit, chat
[1:54:33] <Ultimatefool> So like half
[1:54:36] <OkamiDude15> so like 1/4
[1:54:37] <%YakumoYomi> Not even halfway through the game.
[1:54:39] <hamiltin463> So like 1/3
[1:54:40] <Futurecity10> yes
[1:54:41] <+alphonseisbest> oh so a fair bit then
[1:54:41] <$WackyXmand> the one in X is terrible the joke of cooking him isn't funny
[1:54:41] <+reiface08> like a quarter
[1:54:42] <ValidVenasaur> 40%
[1:54:43] <WRFWD> Just before the story started to get fucking crazy, first half of the game more or less
[1:54:44] <LorcaNomad> wow
[1:54:44] <%Starotter70> More like 40 or so
[1:54:45] <%blastazoid26> Not even halfway LUL
[1:54:46] <SubjectTea> nah, like a 1/3
[1:54:46] <+alphonseisbest> 1/3
[1:54:46] <%Ninestempest> that's like 25%-33%
[1:54:47] <tactician0> no
[1:54:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> LUL That's wrong
[1:54:48] <Greywolf47> LUL
[1:54:48] <@SoFarFetched> only so much
[1:54:48] <%luckysteak> This is a HUGE game
[1:54:49] <%GohanHitsugaya> HOW!
[1:54:49] <j0ustar> Nopon go Meeehhhh
[1:54:49] <+Casual_Nopon> Yup
[1:54:49] <%cowardman93> game is LORGE
[1:54:50] <%MisterRockett> 40%
[1:54:51] <WRFWD> 40% or 50%
[1:54:53] <CappuccinoGuil> THIS GAME IS BIG
[1:54:54] <+Taisuru> I mean depends on how much side stuff ya do
[1:54:55] <%MisterRockett> Maybe 35
[1:54:55] <%ringabal> WE GONNA GO PLACES PAT
[1:54:55] <dinnydanny777> How did this game fit on a Wii?
[1:54:55] <SainEdge> 40 %
[1:54:55] <+alphonseisbest> 1 //3
[1:54:56] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> fun fact, in 2 there's a sidequest that reveals that the nopon act and talk the way they do so they can scam people easier LUL
[1:54:57] <+HiroTSK5> 33ish
[1:54:58] <%GohanHitsugaya> I got that far too
[1:54:58] <+fetrigon> BIG GAME PAT
[1:54:58] <+blademaster247> These games are like a million hours Pat
[1:55:00] <%Crimpson> WOW
[1:55:02] <glass_marcus> this game has a real ass on her
[1:55:03] <Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> W O W
[1:55:03] <Futurecity10> After that you have sword bridge, then Mechon factory, then Mechon core
[1:55:05] <Kghaleon> I'm assuming you go to the other giant at some point
[1:55:05] <+alphonseisbest> 33%
[1:55:06] <LorcaNomad> you gonna beat this one if that's the case? @PatStaresAt
[1:55:07] <%GohanHitsugaya> And I thought I was almost done...
[1:55:07] <theanora1> this game is HUGE
[1:55:10] <$Draylle> thanks XB2
[1:55:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> This isn't the dumb gacha shit
[1:55:13] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh man this mechanic LUL
[1:55:15] <dinnydanny777> Was the Wii's disc size underutilised?
[1:55:15] <Cdjgamer> pat you havent got past sayian saga yet
[1:55:16] <OkamiDude15> gems are fucking sick in this game
[1:55:18] <oldmemesdiehard> This game has an enormous dump truck ass
[1:55:29] <olaksi> *This will be relevant in 50 hours*
[1:55:35] <doggieo> Dont let the goblins set in
[1:55:38] <%moogleboy1984> Jem is truly truly truly outrageous
[1:55:39] <Futurecity10> Dont forget XB2 has a 40 dollar dlc that's like 8 hours long
[1:55:40] <+Casual_Nopon> Nopon are the best. No, I don't have a bias
[1:55:40] <%glgzephyr> this isn't materia. it's diablo
[1:55:40] <%ShawnTK_> @PatStaresAt Remember that Agility is really really really good
[1:55:44] <+lucaflowe> The main story clocks in at 68 hours it's a long ass game
[1:55:48] <dinnydanny777> Some Wii games are pretty long though to be honest, Twilight Princess is really long
[1:55:51] <theanora1> Just think this was first available on the Wii and NOA thought it would do poorly
[1:55:53] <SubjectTea> it took me like 100 hrs to beat with a lot of side quests done too
[1:55:53] <vinnnyaraujo> calling Riki a mascot character is offensive to him. Because putting him together with these shitty merchandise bait from others rpg is a crime. Riki is legit top 3 best characters in xenoblade 1
[1:55:58] <%Lunaticbro > dodge rate
[1:55:58] <WRFWD> AGILITY IS OP
[1:55:59] <%Crimpson> You go fast!
[1:56:00] <Darren716> Agility is busted
[1:56:01] <%Starotter70> Agility is the best stat in the game
[1:56:01] <+alphonseisbest> @PAT how much of that playthrough do u remember?
[1:56:01] <CappuccinoGuil> Shulk is a glass cannon
[1:56:01] <Ultimatefool> Oh look it's master Miller
[1:56:03] <madboaroffaerghus> Dodge tanking is great
[1:56:06] <%Starotter70> Hit/Evade
[1:56:08] <Darren716> It lets you dodge
[1:56:09] <%MisterRockett> Dodge hits. Best for Shulk and your future dodge tank.
[1:56:09] <WRFWD> Agility makes you hit more and dodge more
[1:56:09] <OkamiDude15> agility is for dodge
[1:56:10] <SGrim> Agility make fast go
[1:56:11] <%ShawnTK_> Agility affects Dodge rate and makes it really fucking big
[1:56:12] <marvel877> Like 60-70 hours, plus sidequests, about over 100 hours.
[1:56:14] <dinnydanny777> When's the full LP
[1:56:14] <+alphonseisbest> its dodge
[1:56:15] <%Ninestempest> You can make literal dodge tanks lol
[1:56:17] <GDandy> Evasion tanking
[1:56:18] <CappuccinoGuil> Attack faster and dodge
[1:56:18] <glass_marcus> My first playthrough doing every side quest I found took 120 hours
[1:56:23] <%bread_assassin> Anyone know if Dunban's naked skill tree is worth it?
[1:56:24] <WRFWD> More agility let's you hit higher level enemies better
[1:56:24] <%Ninestempest> it's fucking hilarious
[1:56:28] <Cdjgamer> AGI is hit and dodge
[1:56:29] <Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> Without agility you're just cosplaying yourself
[1:56:30] <+HiroTSK5> Quest Item
[1:56:32] <CappuccinoGuil> @bread_assassin super
[1:56:34] <$PhantomMiG> Does this one fit that stat bug
[1:56:35] <%Starotter70> Naked Dunban is the best
[1:56:38] <%ryome> Action economy
[1:56:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Dunban specializes in dodge-tanking it's pretty good
[1:56:47] <$Draylle> agreed
[1:56:47] <OkamiDude15> @CappuccinoGuil iirc there is a different gem for auto attack speed
[1:56:53] <%glgzephyr> oh in a fucking decade?
[1:56:55] <tactician0> my dick is hard
[1:56:56] <%filialpails> there is a switch emulator, yuzu
[1:56:57] <SubjectTea> i wonder if they have that level 120 dragon on top of the snowy mountain area???
[1:57:00] <metabot64> I think you already can do that?
[1:57:01] <olaksi> Still waiting for X360 emulator
[1:57:02] <Kghaleon> I messed up and bought wonderful 101 on Switch not realizing it was on PS4
[1:57:04] <%cvp5127> you mean yuzu?
[1:57:09] <%glgzephyr> @filialpails but does it work
[1:57:11] <metabot64> yuzu
[1:57:11] <+trialbyrespawn> He has more quest for you
[1:57:16] <danpc5> ye yuzu already works, dunno if it runs this game yet
[1:57:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> bunny murder!
[1:57:19] <ToneBacas> yuzu and ryujinx
[1:57:19] <dinnydanny777> Killing rabbits seems extremely heroic
[1:57:21] <%Starotter70> This guy has a shit ton
[1:57:26] <OkamiDude15> @SubjectTea they fuckin better be here
[1:57:27] <madboaroffaerghus> Pat doesnt know that a rabbit is one of the games super bosses.
[1:57:28] <%코코꾸라> OH FUCK

[1:57:39] <%bread_assassin> Thank god for armor glamours so we don't ACTUALLY need to see Dunban run around in his underwear for the buffs.
[1:57:39] <tactician0> time is relevent
[1:57:40] <%Lunaticbro > blood thirsty RABBITS AND CRABS?
[1:57:40] <gordieda20> LUL

[1:57:47] <hamiltin463> Time of day change
[1:57:49] <%Movemeister> LUL
[1:57:56] <WRFWD> There's always an NPC with a ton of monster quests in every new location
[1:57:56] <SubjectTea> @OkamiDude15 were you able to beat it? i maxed out at level 99 can could not beat it
[1:57:57] <glass_marcus> he doesn't give the side Quest, HE IS THE SIDE QUEST
[1:58:01] <orangerainbow> her dad is xord
[1:58:02] <Saltmeisterr> the fact that w101 runs worse on switch is a crime
[1:58:04] <%glgzephyr> desiree is a really good name
[1:58:10] <Kghaleon> Kinda annoying how people only show up at certain hours
[1:58:11] <+HoopzBarkley91> Pat if you would of started Future Connected and skipped the scenes, you could of got a cool costume for Shulk for having a "save" from it to use in the main game. @PatStaresAt
[1:58:25] <olaksi> RTX is muting the woman again

[2:02:22] <Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> nice sentence
[2:02:23] <%arancet> i really like this game, but after spending so much time 100%ing it before theres no way i can do it again
[2:02:25] <%GohanHitsugaya> This game is so bloated with side quests, you don't even know!
[2:02:28] <+Remery_> @OkamiDude15 Okay :)
[2:02:30] <SubjectTea> the music for xcx was awful and hated that nearly all of the music had lyrics
[2:02:34] <+fetrigon> Gaur Plains monkaS
[2:02:34] <%AncelDeLambert> it had a Dark Souls lore opening
[2:02:35] <chronoxgp> thiss is ff12 with seamless transistions and larger maps
[2:02:38] <derap41> That Cricket noise made me think my PC was freaking out
[2:02:39] <%happyface699> So much sweat
[2:02:40] <LorcaNomad> Xenoblade 1 is a lot cooler than 2
[2:02:42] <morthieus> cryGasm
[2:02:43] <%walternatorz> compare and contrast? is this high school english class?
[2:02:43] <olaksi> I am convinced most of the sidequests in this game are programmatically generated, "Hello, [hero] please give me [7] [invisible squirrel eggs]"
[2:02:44] <%AncelDeLambert> how boring is the combat, tho?
[2:02:48] <$Draylle> the voice acting is better
[2:02:48] <WRFWD> Pat it's better to do the quest once you have 3 characters in your party, something that won't take long at all
[2:02:48] <%glgzephyr> ok but that's the first hour what about the rest of it
[2:02:53] <dinnydanny777> Open Sesam
[2:02:58] <%arancet> also shulk isnt a horrible bitch like rex is
[2:02:58] <%ElenaManetta> hahahah
[2:02:58] <dinnydanny777> Open Sesame
[2:02:58] <+King_floppy> I like the party alot more in Xenoblade 2
[2:03:03] <+Benial17> You're in Sesame's realm now
[2:03:04] <%Roflmag> Would you recommend Xenoblade over the Tales series?
[2:03:06] <%Lunaticbro > Yeah, This is ghost club
[2:03:06] <+MediocreHermits> are you talking to all the people who are green dots one the mini map they fill out the affinity chart
[2:03:06] <%GohanHitsugaya> Pretty boring combat...
[2:03:07] <%Starotter70> Spooky
[2:03:11] <%psidefx> Sesame plants the seed
[2:03:11] <%ringabal> "You have to let go, Sesame."
[2:03:12] <+fetrigon> Spent WAAAAAY too much time trying to complete all the side quests there. LUL
[2:03:12] <OkamiDude15> there are a lot of sidequests but the you have to realize that there most sidequests only give you money instead of EXP so you can choose which ones you want to do.
[2:03:15] <dinnydanny777> Sesame is bringing you to the shadow realm
[2:03:15] <Hazard_Kujacker> Im really stealing it!
[2:03:16] <%luckysteak> dead men tell no tales
[2:03:17] <%Movemeister> Ghosts are the best groupees
[2:03:18] <tactician0> ❔ The progression in 2 is such a drag
[2:03:20] <%ElenaManetta> you cant have ghost friends now? wtf
[2:03:24] <Manmadeawesome> Xenoblade 2 has way better combat
[2:03:24] <%heartlesshealer> He's a shyamalalan
[2:03:25] <%nofestu2> yo girl you want some of my sesame sead?
[2:03:26] <%scibren> There are 2 kinds of quests. Unique and generic. Only the unique ones give EXP
[2:03:35] <%mckraven> He takes you to the sesame realm to keep it extra secreet
[2:03:36] <chronoxgp> xeno is better than the earlier tales games
[2:03:38] <+xenoriddley36> I need to get this now
[2:03:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> there's always gonna be people who think a bad game is a masterpiece.
[2:03:45] <Futurecity10> @Manmadeawesome Yeah, I love enemies that take 7 minutes to kill
[2:03:49] <kiwicoffin> Yep it's a single press
[2:03:50] <+xenoriddley36> Stream it and just do nothing but side quests for weeks
[2:03:52] <+MediocreHermits> its fine as long as you dont go backwards
[2:03:57] <xeroslash1> xenoblade 2 had the same thing

[2:05:16] <Project205> oh come on, it can't be THAT bad!
[2:05:18] <fluffy_sauce> what about Xenoblade Chronicles x?
[2:05:29] <tactician0> 😂
[2:05:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> I played Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and I didn't really like the combat. it was fine, but if it really is better than Xenoblade Chronicles is, it seems like the combat in this game might be bad.
[2:05:31] <StaticSunrise> x doesn't exist
[2:05:33] <BallerSwagBro9k> BUT BIG TIDDIE WAIFU THO
[2:05:33] <metabot64> How is X i just started?

[2:38:38] <dinnydanny777> He waited for her to run up the stairs so that he could pretend to be talking about something interesting
[2:38:43] <chronoxgp> m8 this is so far in the future it's borderline star trek, xeno x is the sequel to this

[2:40:39] <Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt XB1 and 2 take place simultaneously in different dimensions
[2:40:40] <olaksi> The xenoblade was inside you all along
[2:40:40] <theanora1> They are different worlds
[2:40:40] <+Dimfish> XC2 is a different world entirely
[2:40:47] <michelangelo_c> Different worlds
[2:40:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Truly, WE were the Xenoblade Chornicles 2
[2:40:50] <%YakumoYomi> No, there's a reference at the end that kinda ties them together
[2:40:51] <AceArann> Different universes
[2:40:52] <+blademaster247> The real Bionis was the friends we made along the way
[2:40:57] <%heartlesshealer> actually different planets, unfortunately
[2:40:58] <CappuccinoGuil> BITCH HOLD ON
[2:40:58] <+alphonseisbest> DIFFERENT WORLDS PAT
[2:40:59] <+ALazo> XB2 and XB1 happen in explicitly different worlds
[2:40:59] <%Lunaticbro > maybe the real xenoblade chronicles were the friends we made along the way?
[2:41:02] <%GabeSweetMan> Get revenge on that Bat!

[2:41:12] <CappuccinoGuil> WHY DOES IT EXIST???
[2:41:13] <jellssssss20> I don’t think that’s how fireworks are supposed to look smh
[2:41:13] <dinnydanny777> The idea of the world being a giant mecha reminds me of the Turtle with the Earth on it's back from Terry Pratchett novels
[2:41:15] <+Delenay> why did they name it 2 if its not related to the first one then
[2:41:22] <QuestionableDes> Tales stuff
[2:41:23] <CappuccinoGuil> IT'S SOCIAL LINKS
[2:41:24] <doggieo> Its just lore
[2:41:27] <+Remery_> Build that S-Rank
[2:41:27] <+prime_name> Just say the right things
[2:41:28] <+alphonseisbest> ITS A SOCIAL LINK
[2:41:30] <%arancet> its just go here for social link scene
[2:41:31] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt To be fair, you have to go all over the place
[2:41:31] <iosephe> Pat doesn't understand heart to heart conversations
[2:41:31] <gordieda20> LUL
[2:41:32] <OkamiDude15> level you social links
[2:41:32] <%heartlesshealer> Tales Skits
[2:41:35] <StaticSunrise> it's just an S link
[2:41:35] <%xeros720> they are just cutscenes that award affinity, that's it
[2:41:37] <+Ace5335> it's social link events
[2:41:39] <WRFWD> Well they're easier to find now
[2:41:40] <%Starotter70> They build Affinity
[2:41:40] <FoolproofDread> Maybe the falling shrapnel will improve the sandwich
[2:41:40] <%GohanHitsugaya> Make sure to use a guide then.
[2:41:41] <+alphonseisbest> U DIDN'T HAVE ALL PARTY MEMBERS
[2:41:41] <jellssssss20> Social link!
[2:41:46] <rampagingsoul> LUL
[2:41:49] <olaksi> @dinnydanny777 That's very old mythology from real history though
[2:41:49] <damnvier> 20 hours of sidecontent that doesnt involve the part to much..
[2:41:51] <tactician0> you weren't doing it right
[2:41:53] <dinnydanny777> So that you can't game them
[2:41:54] <%heartlesshealer> Location-locked probably
[2:41:55] <+R_BChe> u were 40% in LUL
[2:41:56] <%Starotter70> There's a lot
[2:41:57] <+alphonseisbest> JUST ARE
[2:41:58] <oregames> the party has their own affinity chart
[2:42:00] <WRFWD> Because you need to level up affinity to unlock them
[2:42:00] <%furiousfurioso> it's because you dont have a full party, so some are for people you're missing
[2:42:02] <%scibren> Xenoblade 1 has really high affinity requirements for all of them
[2:42:03] <CappuccinoGuil> Literally didn't have the full party
[2:42:03] <+trialbyrespawn> The people have to like each other for it to activate.
[2:42:06] <%xeros720> if it's like xc2, they are backloaded
[2:42:06] <%moogleboy1984> @PatStaresAt I thought you literally meant you didn't understand social interaction for a second and was not surprised in the slightest
[2:42:06] <%heartlesshealer> ah
[2:42:06] <%Nobrev> You have to find them on the msp
[2:42:07] <doggieo> Gotta bond with our bros in battle a ton
[2:42:07] <%YakumoYomi> Heart to Hearts happen all over the world, and you only saw about 30% of it in your playthrough
[2:42:08] <dv9l> you need almost the entire team
[2:42:09] <+Ace5335> there's a lot of them
[2:42:10] <oceanmatt> cause u dont like the other party memebers good enough
[2:42:11] <+R_BChe> u ddidnt even have the full party
[2:42:11] <madboaroffaerghus> Many of them are blocked off during the story
[2:42:12] <%arancet> theyre rare early, more members means more scenes between them
[2:42:12] <WRFWD> If you always use the same party you don't get affinity
[2:42:18] <WRFWD> But you can give gifts
[2:42:20] <%Daniel_Is_I> YEAH
[2:42:22] <+alphonseisbest> U DIDN'T HAVE A FULL PARTY
[2:42:26] <+trialbyrespawn> Yeah
[2:42:26] <%heartlesshealer> You must encourage and gift them
[2:42:27] <DeoxysPrime> XB2 does it much better
[2:42:29] <chronoxgp> the heart to hearts are like one every 3 hours dude
[2:42:35] <+alphonseisbest> UR MEANT TO COME BACK TO THEM
[2:42:35] <glaciusinfinite> ITS SO YOU KNOW
[2:42:41] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt You have to be like 70% through the game
[2:42:42] <CappuccinoGuil> Gotta give them gifts
[2:42:43] <%Starotter70> You need to build affinity, cause it takes a while
[2:42:49] <olaksi> I love premature tutorials that won't be relevant until 10 hours game time or so
[2:42:49] <+apocplz> i took my glasses off and in that pause menu it looks like Fiora has hands across her chest spread like Goatse apocpl1LUL
[2:42:52] <+prime_name> XB2 Heart-to-hearts are much better
[2:42:55] <jellssssss20> Maybe they made it better in this version?
[2:43:00] <WRFWD> You don't HAVE TO, but it really helps
[2:43:00] <%GabeSweetMan> Shove gifts down their gift hole to make them love you.
[2:43:01] <damnvier> Fiora is such fun to play
[2:43:08] <+R_BChe> "whole" game
[2:43:09] <%xeros720> fiora gonna sneak up to shulk and give him the POWER SMASH
[2:43:09] <%bevyrage> xenoblade doesn't do heart-to-heart right like with tales of games, where xenoblade requires a full party most of the time and are rare until you pretty much reach the 50% mark

[2:43:27] <%heartlesshealer> switch up members so the affinity doesn't get stale I guess

[2:45:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @ergulor 40
[2:45:08] <CappuccinoGuil> all 18??? *_*
[2:45:10] <ergulor> Tanks
[2:45:11] <+Taisuru> RESTART
[2:45:11] <OkamiDude15> @ergulor riki has like 8 kids
[2:45:12] <SubjectTea> ricky
[2:45:15] <tactician0> Ricky is 40
[2:45:19] <CappuccinoGuil> @ergulor he's literally a daddy
[2:45:19] <+CaptainJax> Pat they're JUST social links
[2:45:20] <%ringabal> Pat, it's not that important
[2:45:21] <damnvier> hrm.. i mean... why would you care for her.. you already know what happens until the treestuff right?
[2:45:25] <%Ninestempest> Pat, part of the problem is they are all over the place, but sometimes are way behind you. So sometimes you have to like, quick travel to places to see them
[2:45:28] <jellssssss20> What actually is the Xenoblade? Is it like naming dmc the Yamato or just devilsword
[2:45:30] <+Promessa_EX> the implication of taking a 17 yr old charactewr and makig her 18 in the us isn't great
[2:45:35] <natertot1> You need to fail one anywasy for the cheevo its not a big loss
[2:45:35] <%ElkRiverDog> psaGoblin
[2:45:39] <+Promessa_EX> but that's what they do
[2:45:39] <olaksi> Pat, why wouldn't you save before a heart-2-heart?
[2:45:42] <CappuccinoGuil> Look at a character's "likes" before gifting
[2:45:42] <DXLelouch24> @damnvier he doesnt, he never got that far
[2:45:51] <FoolproofDread> That's how you know theyre being genuine with the ages
[2:45:57] <%heartlesshealer> All the heart-to-hearts are location-locked too though it sounds like
[2:45:59] <olaksi> 1 GUY
[2:46:01] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Shulk loves his Jumpah
[2:46:03] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt honestly don't worry about for this awhile. You get affinity in battle
[2:46:04] <+CaptainJax> in all three Xenoblade games there is a different xeno blade
[2:46:05] <chronoxgp> @jellssssss20 they were actually planning on calling it Monando the last blade or something
[2:46:07] <%itIsJustMat> itIsJustMat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[2:46:10] <%furiousfurioso> you can just make up the affinity through fighting, getting the questions right just does it faster
[2:46:10] <%heartlesshealer> so four per pair, but also find them
[2:46:11] <dinnydanny777> I mean, the age of consent in probably most countries outside of the US and when you are usually considered an adult is usually 16, not 18
[2:46:14] <dv9l> the game rewards you So Much for exploring and going back to places
[2:46:15] <OkamiDude15> @heartlesshealer they are location locked
[2:46:16] <tactician0> pat why did you listen to chat
[2:46:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> These mofos footsteps sound like horse hooves
[2:46:17] <glaciusinfinite> wamp wamp
[2:46:32] <%bevyrage> @jellssssss20 xenoblade is themed after an alien weapon or arsenal that the game focuses on. xenoblade chronicles focuses on the manado's history exclusively
[2:46:32] <jellssssss20> OneGuy you did it again!
[2:46:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> oh man that shitty jump is nostalgic
[2:46:38] <redapache> I completely ignores this heart to heart when I played the game, I couldn't be bothered at all with affinity shit
[2:46:40] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt There are correct answers for these
[2:46:47] <+alphonseisbest> NO U DIDNT
[2:46:48] <WRFWD> No you didn't, believe me

[2:46:49] <doggieo> impossible
[2:46:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You did not Pat
[2:46:56] <Futurecity10> In those area's is usually a high level boss monster to kill
[2:46:56] <%Starotter70> There's always more
[2:46:56] <theanora1> You couldn't at your level
[2:47:01] <%Dr00_PhD> you super didn't
[2:47:05] <%Ninestempest> They literlaly unlock more as you level up
[2:47:07] <%bevyrage> you have to explore it 100% again LATER
[2:47:08] <%Treuan> I'm glad we did it, even though it was that one time
[2:47:09] <+alphonseisbest> U FOR REAL COULDN'T
[2:47:10] <SubjectTea> high level monsters insta kill you
[2:47:10] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Wow this upscaling looks magnificent DAMNNNN
[2:47:10] <WRFWD> You can't 100% any area the first time you visit it
[2:47:10] <theanora1> There are level 70 enemies in this zone
[2:47:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You literally cannot where you were in the game
[2:47:13] <Futurecity10> Pat, in this area is a level 70 monster
[2:47:14] <+R_BChe> remember the big chad gorillas that were level 70 in ur starting aerea?
[2:47:21] <%bigboy3d> the sidequests update
[2:47:21] <%Lunaticbro > level 70 enemies

[2:47:34] <+alphonseisbest> u can't the game won't let u
[2:47:34] <twoto858> There's a level 40 monster in the area that blocks a path
[2:47:35] <%bevyrage> game locks off areas that you can't explore the first time through most regions
[2:47:37] <hamiltin463> There are enemys here that are like lvl 80
[2:47:38] <+noajenkk> oh my god this remastered OST
[2:47:42] <OkamiDude15> pat has gaslit himself
[2:47:43] <%heartlesshealer> Beef gates unlock

[2:47:43] <jellssssss20> Pat's crazy talk is activating
[2:47:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Areas change more like
[2:47:46] <%bevyrage> they get unlocked when you clear later regions instead
[2:47:46] <Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Area's also change due to story reasons
[2:47:46] <+alphonseisbest> SECRECT AREAS
[2:47:46] <%Ninestempest> @Admiral_PopnFresh well they were nothing-face characters before so
[2:47:48] <%ringabal> The game levels up with you
[2:47:50] <SubjectTea> THERES A STORAGE SHED IN THE TEPHRA CAVE THAT YOU CANNOT UNLOCK

[2:47:58] <glaciusinfinite> WAMP WAMP
[2:48:01] <%Starotter70> They Branch
[2:48:01] <%GabeSweetMan> I hate dialogue options being deliberately vague like "kind of".
[2:48:02] <dinnydanny777> This music really sounds like a song from Kingdom Hearts
[2:48:02] <%bigboy3d> There's also affinity level for the cities and areas themselve, which unlock new quests
[2:48:07] <Novillion> Pat you didn't see everything qwhat don't you get
[2:48:07] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt areas open up, and there are areas with high lvl enemies
[2:48:08] <damnvier> best thing was honestly going into new game plus and stoping the bosses in the early areas
[2:48:08] <%Ninestempest> beef???

[2:48:33] <Zombrocom> That was a different conversation
[2:48:33] <%heartlesshealer> Beef gates are just "put big enemy here to discourage early explore before they are ready"
[2:48:33] <%furiousfurioso> ITS FINE

[2:49:31] <%cvp5127> pat you're never gonna play this again who cares
[2:49:31] <SubjectTea> it grows over time
[2:49:32] <%filialpails> don't forget to equip a persona of the same arcana
[2:49:33] <%scibren> Affinity is way better in 2
[2:49:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> "Oh, I sure wish Shulk remembered the bullshit,I do. Fish and chips! Poppycock!"
[2:49:36] <%redrins> how
[2:49:36] <+alphonseisbest> U DIDN'T HAVE A FULL PARTY PAT
[2:49:37] <+CaptainJax> it's just social links but you get points for fighting together
[2:49:38] <%heartlesshealer> well you can do it this time around in the better version, so whatever
[2:49:38] <OkamiDude15> @PatStaresAt did you explore and have the whole party?
[2:49:40] <%xeros720> it's a purely background mechanic that gives a passive buff
[2:49:42] <%Starotter70> Only 30?
[2:49:45] <doggieo> They are all over the place and dont show up all at once
[2:49:47] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt you need to use other party members in battle or give them items then

[2:50:40] <%afronooch> thats dumb
[2:50:43] <dinnydanny777> #Ohhhhhhhhh, Fiona, your fist, has punched, my heart#
[2:50:43] <+alphonseisbest> ITS REALLY NOT MAN
[2:50:44] <+Count_Graagh> BIG SPOILERS
[2:50:45] <powerprotoman> you can SEE them on the map pat
[2:50:45] <%Ninestempest> flirt harder nower
[2:50:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Because you can start doing them now
[2:50:46] <%ShawnTK_> because they unlock as you get more characters
[2:50:47] <damnvier> dont tell him
[2:50:49] <%ringabal> NO ONE SAY NOTHING
[2:50:50] <sendart> guess it doesn't matter that much
[2:50:50] <CappuccinoGuil> CHAT, HE DIDN'T PLAY THE WHOLE GAME, NO SPOILERS
[2:50:50] <Saltmeisterr> of course he doesn't know about seven chat
[2:50:50] <%heartlesshealer> Honestly they want to get all the tutorial shit out of the way at the start probably
[2:50:51] <%Lunaticbro > probably so you don't need to back track at the very end to do all of it
[2:50:52] <WRFWD> HE DOESNT KNOW 7 SHHHHH
[2:50:52] <+blademaster247> Are you saying you won't remember this shit when it actually unlocks in like 50 hours
[2:50:52] <SubjectTea> CHAT DONT TELL HIM
[2:50:55] <FoolproofDread> make sure you give people time to forget things before they can use them
[2:50:57] <doggieo> The HearttoHeart of characters you dont have dont show up
[2:50:59] <CappuccinoGuil> I CANNOT BELIEVE Y'ALL ARE PULLING AN FF7 HERE
[2:51:00] <Futurecity10> Pat why do you care, you wont be coming back to this game
[2:51:01] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> theres no way he doesnt find out
[2:51:03] <olaksi> flirt with fiona *you don't have enough courage*
[2:51:05] <vinnnyaraujo> if your last character was melia then you were like 30% trhough the original game LUL
[2:51:05] <CrypticMochi> You can work on it early that’s why
[2:51:06] <%dave323dave> psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon
[2:51:07] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> its too long
[2:51:09] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> hes doomed
[2:51:10] <%ringabal> QUICK SOMEONE GO EMOTE ONLY
[2:51:14] <+ATorL> affinity is literally gained simply by completing the QTEs in battle and by giving gifts, then when you have enough you can do Heart-to-Hearts which are entirely just for character building. Also you don't need the whole party. You build affinity between two characters while they fight together.
[2:51:16] <%valriot> LUL
[2:51:16] <%xeros720> just call clemps pat
[2:51:20] <tactician0> @PatStaresAt So you can get to grinding to start relationships
[2:51:22] <%blastazoid26> SHUT UP PAT
[2:51:25] <+ViewtifulCrow> Go in RAW
[2:51:26] <%GohanHitsugaya> Pat, just look up a guide!
[2:51:26] <%MisterRockett> You need the full party because heart-to-hearts are specific to two specific charaters in the party.
[2:51:27] <+KrazyKefka> LUL
[2:51:27] <+R_BChe> WORK ON THEIR AFFINITY
[2:51:28] <%valriot> LUL LUL LUL
[2:51:30] <hamiltin463> You need to swap characters and build affinity with everyone
[2:51:31] <%heartlesshealer> Because they teach you about gifts at the same time
[2:51:33] <%ShawnTK_> YOU NEED SPECIFIC CHARACTERS
[2:51:34] <+ViewtifulCrow> RAW
[2:51:34] <dinnydanny777> They teach you early so that you can know how the mechanic works
[2:51:35] <Futurecity10> Because you only found the ones with party members you didnt have
[2:51:35] <%heartlesshealer> it's dumb
[2:51:37] <BallerSwagBro9k> GIT GUD PAT
[2:51:37] <+alphonseisbest> CUZ U DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH POINTS
[2:51:38] <Snookasaurus> work on, but not unlock
[2:51:39] <SubjectTea> cuz all you had were the dudes in your party
[2:51:41] <%bread_assassin> They are also gated by affinity level. You didn't build it up enough to see them.
[2:51:42] <%valriot> HE DOESNT KNOW PEPELAUGH OH NO NO NO NO
[2:51:43] <vinnnyaraujo> bacause....its takes time??
[2:51:44] <+Taisuru> Need to be in specific locations
[2:51:44] <%Valdorick> Because its a bad system
[2:51:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @PatStaresAt You legit just missed them man, you should've been able to see them
[2:51:46] <Manmadeawesome> you didnt raise their affection toward each other
[2:51:46] <+D00msDayDan> making friends is hard
[2:51:47] <doggieo> Location time and party member setup
[2:51:48] <+CaptainJax> Because you only used three characters the whole game
[2:51:48] <%cylish> By working on it they mean giving gifts and shit like that, not doing the date spots
[2:51:50] <%MisterRockett> You only found the ones for party members you didn't have.
[2:51:50] <%moogleboy1984> Think of it like the date scene at the Gold Saucer
[2:51:51] <%luckysteak> need to build up relations between characters, and they are spread out late in teh game. you can see their relationship in the affinity menu
[2:51:51] <jellssssss20> Oh boy spoilers abound
[2:51:53] <%blastazoid26> Also shut up Chat
[2:51:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> Look at these dumb kids with their pony feet
[2:51:56] <%GohanHitsugaya> You need one if you want to do heart-to-hearts.
[2:51:57] <+alphonseisbest> ITS LIKE A HIDDEN S=LINK GUAGE
[2:51:57] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt They show up too early. If affinity scenes appeared with each new character, maybe it would be better
[2:51:59] <FodderAplenty> Would you prefer that the heart to hearts not appear on the map at all?
[2:52:01] <OkamiDude15> @PatStaresAt they exist on the map regardless but to do them you need to raise affinity between the pair
[2:52:02] <damnvier> its also something for NG+
[2:52:02] <+jofrankii> you make evrything so much more complicated than it really is lolol
[2:52:04] <%blastazoid26> Yes
[2:52:07] <+alphonseisbest> YUP
[2:52:07] <+ATorL> no
[2:52:08] <+prime_name> Yes
[2:52:09] <+Ace5335> for the s link yeah
[2:52:10] <SainEdge> kinda
[2:52:10] <%MisterRockett> NO
[2:52:10] <Futurecity10> Yes and no
[2:52:10] <Valentinius_Anodyne> No?
[2:52:11] <olaksi> This game has few mechanics it tutorializes prematurely, yeah
[2:52:11] <%heartlesshealer> yes kinda
[2:52:11] <SubjectTea> kinda
[2:52:12] <+ATorL> it doesn't take that long
[2:52:12] <%afronooch> thats hella dumb
[2:52:12] <%Ninestempest> wat
[2:52:13] <+ALazo> There are affinity and location requirements with multiple characters for a single scene pat.
[2:52:14] <tactician0> Yeah sort of
[2:52:14] <%furiousfurioso> there are absolutely early ones, I just did one towards the start
[2:52:16] <+RowenCleric> maybe
[2:52:16] <+Remery_> kinda sorta
[2:52:17] <%GabeSweetMan> Nyes?
[2:52:17] <CappuccinoGuil> Getting affinities high takes a lot of time. They teach you early so you can start doing that for all characters. Some H2H require specific chars at high affinity at certain times of day
[2:52:19] <%cylish> It also goes up as they quest with you
[2:52:20] <%bevyrage> you can always start to bribe your way towards affection before you have the encounters themselves yes
[2:52:22] <DXLelouch24> lol it doesnt take 40 hours who tld you that?
[2:52:22] <+alphonseisbest> MOSTLY YEAH
[2:52:22] <doggieo> Kinda.
[2:52:22] <Manmadeawesome> you can check in the affinity in the menu
[2:52:24] <+ATorL> because some people are fucking wrong
[2:52:24] <%bread_assassin> Well, when you put it that way.....
[2:52:25] <%maenos2> Sanity at risk!
[2:52:26] <theanora1> Date spots are a reward for dumping items into characters
[2:52:26] <%heartlesshealer> gift system is why yes and no
[2:52:26] <+Taisuru> They only happen with specific part member setups and times/locations. ALL OF THESE NEED TO BE CORRECT FOR ONE TO HAPPEN.
[2:52:28] <+egalitarian696969> damn he still on this
[2:52:32] <Zombrocom> Because of steram delay
[2:52:33] <%Ninestempest> because it's not a good question and opinions vary
[2:52:33] <doggieo> There are LEVELS of Heart to Heart
[2:52:34] <vinnnyaraujo> They are not S.links; they are just extra cutscenes they have no influenve
[2:52:34] <+skylerpilot> Pat you build relationships between the characters, when that is high enough. You go to specific locations at specific times of day to watch the scene. YOU just didn't do that
[2:52:36] <Zombrocom> Stream delay
[2:52:36] <+Snorlax321> LUL
[2:52:37] <oregames> its to encourage party switching I guess
[2:52:39] <Robot_Nixon_> yes... wait no Jebaited
[2:52:39] <FoolproofDread> Perhaps, maybe, next week, possibly, yes
[2:52:40] <+dirtyh4rr1> Big trolling happening
[2:52:40] <%Ninestempest> you can raise affinity just by playing the damn game
[2:52:41] <+CaptainJax> Nobody knows pat we played this game 10 fucking years ago
[2:52:42] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> it takes a long time for affinity to raise through battle. giving gifts makes it faster, completing quests with the characters in the party helps too
[2:52:42] <Manmadeawesome> you can give gifts to raise affinity
[2:52:43] <%StaceMcGate> no
[2:52:44] <gordieda20> Cause delay
[2:52:44] <%blastazoid26> @PatStaresAt Dont worry about it
[2:52:45] <powerprotoman> because your chats on crack
[2:52:46] <Triedge_101> just look it up on your own pat, you'll get all kinds of mixed messages from chat
[2:52:47] <Novillion> No because it's kinda your fault for only using three characters
[2:52:48] <dv9l> some heart to hearts you cant get until after certain story beats and the story is Long
[2:52:49] <+alphonseisbest> IT A HIDDEN GUAGE PAT
[2:52:50] <%MisterRockett> Right now you can ONLY do the S-Links for Shulk and Ryan at the affinity you have them at. WHEREVER those happen to be at this point, that's all you can do.
[2:52:51] <+ALazo> If you only level affinity with the one character you care about you won't get scenes because you need other character's affinity to be at a certain point for that scene.
[2:52:52] <%ElkRiverDog> psa3guy
[2:52:53] <%Starotter70> Heart to Hearts aren't a huge system
[2:52:54] <%moogleboy1984> "What do you mean I need to build affinity to take Barret on the date instead of Aeris? Why doesn't it let me date Barret right away?" - Pat, probably
[2:52:56] <damnvier> you will go back to revisit areas later
[2:52:59] <+alphonseisbest> YUP
[2:53:01] <twoto858> Most Heart to Hearts literally do nothing, raising the affinity to see the Heart to Hearts can be done naturally
[2:53:02] <%StaceMcGate> SOME HEART TO HEARTS ARE EASY, OTHERS REQUIRE MAX AFFINITY
[2:53:03] <damnvier> so.. its a later thing
[2:53:03] <duel_pro> You do know that you can fast travel to every area right?
[2:53:06] <%furiousfurioso> they would
[2:53:06] <dinnydanny777> Just ply your friends with chocolate man
[2:53:07] <+ATorL> they do
[2:53:08] <SainEdge> they do
[2:53:08] <+trialbyrespawn> They do
[2:53:09] <%Dr00_PhD> they do
[2:53:09] <+R_BChe> CAUSE U DIDNT GO TO A SPECIFIC AREA
[2:53:10] <%redrins> they do
[2:53:12] <+alphonseisbest> U DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH
[2:53:12] <doggieo> They do
[2:53:13] <CappuccinoGuil> They do, but not much
[2:53:14] <Futurecity10> No
[2:53:14] <%ShawnTK_> NO
[2:53:14] <Manmadeawesome> GIFTS AS WELL
[2:53:14] <%heartlesshealer> READ WHAT @Unlimited_Rulebook SAID IN HIGHLIGHT
[2:53:15] <%Starotter70> They Do
[2:53:15] <+ATorL> but you have to find the H2H spots too
[2:53:16] <FodderAplenty> Tey do
[2:53:16] <olaksi> Chat hive mind struggling with consensus, please return to chat in 5 minutes
[2:53:16] <%blastazoid26> No
[2:53:16] <+alphonseisbest> NO
[2:53:17] <vinnnyaraujo> They would
[2:53:18] <+CaptainJax> The heart to hearts are at specific places at specific times
[2:53:18] <%furiousfurioso> These heart to arts are just for extra affinity
[2:53:20] <BallerSwagBro9k> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:53:20] <%Ninestempest> They do, but then you'd have to find their specific heart to hearts, which can be in earlier parts of the game, or even later parts
[2:53:20] <+Snorlax321> n o
[2:53:21] <%redrins> you just have to find the place where they can have the social link convo
[2:53:21] <%GohanHitsugaya> I swear to god Pat, look up a guide!
[2:53:22] <WRFWD> They do, but only between them
[2:53:24] <+apocplz> NotLikeThis
[2:53:24] <%bigboy3d> Rikki is Top tier btw
[2:53:26] <+Snorlax321> they do
[2:53:27] <FoolproofDread> nobody said it was a *good* mechanic
[2:53:27] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> Shulk + dunban & shulk + reyn would get boosted in that instance, not dunban + Reyn
[2:53:30] <doggieo> But oyu have to find the heart to heart spots for them
[2:53:30] <+VantomPayne> here we go again
[2:53:31] <%Ninestempest> Also just look up a guide for them
[2:53:31] <damnvier> dont overthink it
[2:53:31] <%MisterRockett> They did. But you had to find the heart-to-hearts that are SPECIFIC to those combination of characters.
[2:53:35] <Futurecity10> Heart to hearts are just extra affinity, they dont influence everything
[2:53:36] <tactician0> @PatStaresAt There are faster ways to do it late game
[2:53:37] <%KnivesEve> just look up a guide ignore chat
[2:53:38] <%cvp5127> NotLikeThis
[2:53:39] <WRFWD> Affinity is from a character to another character, FOR EVERY CHARACTER
[2:53:39] <CappuccinoGuil> I'm gonna fly over to Montreal to tell you about this, swear to Rikky
[2:53:41] <hamiltin463> But Dunban and Riki can have heart to hearts
[2:53:52] <%bevyrage> yes you have to switch party members because the heart to heart scenes are tied to every connection. some scenes require you to have other party members to trigger their scenes before some will be available
[2:53:53] <%redrins> play game, do cry, get affinity do social link in right place, done
[2:53:59] <dv9l> lets just say you gotta put in a lotta effort to get more heart to hearts
[2:54:07] <WRFWD> If Dunban and Riki don't have high affinity you don't get their H2H
[2:54:10] <jeffthesequel> No your wayyyyy over thinking this Pat.
[2:54:12] <%lilytastic> is this a waifu mechanic for enthusiasts going for NG+ and beyond
[2:54:17] <OkamiDude15> @PatStaresAt affinity increases between the your main party leader and other 2 field members. but not betweent he 2 field members
[2:54:19] <Futurecity10> No shit pats somehow over thinking this
[2:54:19] <%heartlesshealer> Pat I will twitter DM you even though you probably won't read it
[2:54:28] <%SirGO0SE> !uptime
[2:54:29] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 54m.
[2:54:36] <%bevyrage> @lilytastic no, the waifu mechanic is xenoblade chronicles 2 and its gacha system
[2:54:56] <dinnydanny777> Oh haiii doggy
[2:54:58] <MayorRev> hahahaa
[2:54:59] <%wsintai> That is true
[2:55:01] <jellssssss20> Lol
[2:55:04] <%MisterRockett> @OkamiDude15 affinity betweet two subs CAN raise in battle it's just faster between the main.
[2:55:04] <SubjectTea> true
[2:55:05] <%arcielardor> did he win yet?
[2:55:07] <%GabeSweetMan> You're asking a collective memory that played this game like 5 years ago. Lots of this info is probably either inaccurate or invalidated by possible changes in the port. I'd just look up a guide.
[2:55:10] <WRFWD> But don't wory, at least now the game tells you about gifts from the beginning and it helps a lot
[2:55:10] <jellssssss20> There you go heartless
[2:55:16] <Robot_Nixon_> LUL
[2:55:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> I don't even know what a Xenoblade is, so this is mega confusing for me
[2:55:17] <%heartlesshealer> I SAID GOING TO
[2:55:22] <+SinisterBroccoli> Indignant pat is favorite pat
[2:55:26] <+Remery_> Pat's DMs <3
[2:55:26] <%redrins> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:55:32] <nenojojo> lol
[2:55:34] <OkamiDude15> @MisterRockett well i have learned something
[2:55:37] <+alphonseisbest> YUP
[2:55:39] <%ringabal> Is this the Zapping system all over again?
[2:55:39] <%Starotter70> Yes
[2:55:53] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> You're not an idiot for not understanding yet, you'd be dumb if you played 30 hours and didnt get an idea of how it worked though lol
[2:55:56] <+alphonseisbest> Yup
[2:56:01] <%xeros720> this is the worst its been
[2:56:01] <%bigboy3d> It's not complicated, just ling and grindy
[2:56:03] <%valriot> Its not social link, its more of a build up thing
[2:56:06] <chronoxgp> tru giftin'
[2:56:07] <%bigboy3d> long
[2:56:08] <CappuccinoGuil> They are also story and time-of-day locked
[2:56:19] <%xeros720> psaBig psaGoblin
[2:56:26] <+alphonseisbest> LUL
[2:56:32] <%MisterRockett> @OkamiDude15 It's because you still earn affinity from party members helping in battle but you get more from accepting sidequests.
[2:56:32] <damnvier> hm.. fiora hm?
[2:56:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Make sure to change party leader
[2:56:35] <+alphonseisbest> YUP
[2:56:36] <damnvier> how?
[2:56:37] <DetroitSentai> So you feed them affinity pat
[2:56:39] <+prime_name> You mean Sharla
[2:56:39] <%Starotter70> Did you only have him as the leader?
[2:56:40] <SubjectTea> you didnt use sharla?
[2:56:40] <%bigboy3d> gifts
[2:56:42] <+Taisuru> It's almost like people have told you that just having them in the party does nothing
[2:56:45] <oregames> doing quests raise them a ton too
[2:56:46] <+skylerpilot> @PatStaresAt Because you play as Shulk
[2:56:47] <+Ace5335> you need to switch main characters
[2:56:48] <WRFWD> Sharla
[2:56:49] <%luckysteak> changing the lead character and accepting quests is a good way to build affinity with the leader
[2:56:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Affinity through combat is SUPER LOW
[2:56:50] <+ATorL> that's because you played shulk, so all the battle QTEs counted for him
[2:56:52] <vinnnyaraujo> @damnvier please...quiet
[2:56:53] <Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Because you PLAY AS SHULK. Shulk was the Leader, so only they gain affinity with the LEADER
[2:56:53] <%Movemeister> Sharla Kreygasm
[2:56:55] <theanora1> Only the character you're playing gets affinity?
[2:56:59] <chronoxgp> shulk shouldn't even be in the game
[2:56:59] <+alphonseisbest> IT LONG PAT
[2:57:04] <DetroitSentai> Leader gets affinity from quests and talks
[2:57:05] <%redrins> it takes time
[2:57:05] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> battle affinity raises slowly. and only on the relationships of the controlled character to the party members. if you controlled reyn, he would've gotten points with sharla
[2:57:14] <olaksi> @Futurecity10 wow, that kind of sucks
[2:57:14] <OkamiDude15> @MisterRockett gotcha
[2:57:16] <%Starotter70> It's a LONG process
[2:57:17] <+skylerpilot> @PatStaresAt it increases with the character you are playing for their supporters
[2:57:18] <+alphonseisbest> IT TAKES HELLA LONG TO GET PAT
[2:57:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> Shulk's current outfit is horrifying
[2:57:20] <%xeros720> that's bad and dumb
[2:57:23] <DetroitSentai> Just feed them items for affinity
[2:57:24] <Lmsd944> How is this game compared to the 3ds version
[2:57:24] <OkamiDude15> it is stupid
[2:57:25] <+ATorL> you either play as other characters some or give gifts. Completing quests gives affinity between all of the characters though.
[2:57:27] <+alphonseisbest> ITS NOY
[2:57:31] <%valriot> The answer is a spoiler. You werent even close to the full game
[2:57:34] <%furiousfurioso> you don't have to really worry about it if you don't want to
[2:57:35] <+alphonseisbest> NOT
[2:57:43] <chronoxgp> you just get them when you get a new party member
[2:57:44] <Futurecity10> Its not even important
[2:57:46] <chronoxgp> it's not a big deal
[2:57:46] <%heartlesshealer> yeah it's dumb
[2:57:48] <CappuccinoGuil> @alphonseisbest it's super stupid
[2:57:50] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> guess it encourages trying other playstyles
[2:57:52] <dinnydanny777> Affinity should scale with how often Shulk says he is Really Feeling It
[2:57:56] <oregames> the game will progress without doing them too, its all optional lore
[2:57:56] <%StaceMcGate> ITS JUST EXTRA SCENES
[2:57:57] <Zombrocom> As someone who has never played this, I am so lost
[2:57:59] <WRFWD> That's why you can use gifts to raise affinity instead, but you need A LOT.
[2:58:00] <%GohanHitsugaya> Majorly stupid
[2:58:00] <+jiggy_snipe> it incentivizes you use everyone
[2:58:02] <tactician0> @PatStaresAt you're not wrong but thats how it goes switch leaders often
[2:58:02] <+alphonseisbest> ITS READLLY NOT AS BIG DEAL MAN
[2:58:03] <%Starotter70> It's not a major mechanic, so no need to worry about it
[2:58:09] <DetroitSentai> No, its that you dont know the connections
[2:58:12] <+jiggy_snipe> its not the most important thing anyway
[2:58:12] <%xeros720> xc2 did real dumb shit with Trust too
[2:58:15] <%cvp5127> psaGoblin
[2:58:16] <+MediocreHermits> just ignore it and come back to it 50hs later
[2:58:17] <OkamiDude15> heart to hearts dont matter in the long run pat
[2:58:19] <%MisterRockett> I started switching out my leader often based on who was the least popular and got affinity much faster.
[2:58:21] <+alphonseisbest> I THINK U NEED TO ZOOM ON THAT
[2:58:23] <%StaceMcGate> @Zombrocom you need party members with certain levels of affinity with each other to trigger scenes
[2:58:23] <WRFWD> They know each other, you just don't know their relationships yet
[2:58:27] <+R_BChe> heart to heart donest matter anw
[2:58:28] <+CaptainJax> it stinks getting Shulk and Melia affinity because the AI SUCKS at using them
[2:58:35] <vinnnyaraujo> honestly....you should forget abou the afinnity system...they dont even affect the game in any important eay
[2:58:40] <theanora1> Pat, you have to connect the colony, you gain affinity with ALL of the NPCs
[2:58:46] <Nameless0100> Then use gifts. Next best thing
[2:58:46] <tactician0> yea
[2:58:50] <%valriot> You hate it, cos you have opressive OCD that make you ruin amazing games for yourself
[2:58:51] <olaksi> Nah, it doesn't encourage anything, it just locks you out if you don't play character you don't like
[2:58:54] <CappuccinoGuil> Just give them gifts
[2:58:54] <%Valdorick> ITS PRETTY BAD!
[2:58:55] <+ATorL> Pat the battle affinity gain is so small that it barely matters, just do it with gifts for the other characters
[2:58:55] <hamiltin463> Then give gifts
[2:58:57] <Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Lucky for you the affinity system is optional and you can watch all heart to hearts on youtube
[2:58:58] <%StaceMcGate> then just use gifts
[2:59:01] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> Dunban in particular is fun to play as
[2:59:02] <+Taisuru> WHy does it matter? Shulk is just another character man
[2:59:03] <%heartlesshealer> Well..... gonna have to if you want non-Shulk heart to hearts
[2:59:04] <%Metballs> Metballs subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! Gotta keep subbed to my FFXIV chat
[2:59:07] <%Livelinne> O hai Elmo
[2:59:07] <Bluewind098> the main thing affinity effects is a better chance at continuing chain attacks but if you have a comp you like it raises alot anyway
[2:59:07] <%bread_assassin> @CaptainJax Melia's like super good if you control her though, right?
[2:59:07] <%cvp5127> just farm gifts
[2:59:07] <%Starotter70> Gifts are the next best thing
[2:59:07] <Manmadeawesome> Ai is better in this remake from what I could tell
[2:59:08] <chronoxgp> like why can' you have a heart to heart now while wlaking?/
[2:59:09] <%Sokumotanaka> What a shock pat hates good things yet again
[2:59:10] <WRFWD> Yeah doing quests also raises affinity with active party members
[2:59:10] <%StaceMcGate> DON'T WORRY ABOUTIT
[2:59:10] <CappuccinoGuil> You can choose the gift giver and receiver, aim for highly liked items and done
[2:59:11] <%xeros720> what does affinity do in this game?
[2:59:11] <Futurecity10> Not even close
[2:59:12] <DetroitSentai> Getting INFO links them
[2:59:13] <%StaceMcGate> JUST DO QUESTS
[2:59:14] <%MisterRockett> The ai is fine. At a point you won't even be using Shulk anymore xD
[2:59:15] <%Dr00_PhD> lol no
[2:59:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> Chat says to stuff presents in your party's mouths until they love you
[2:59:17] <+CaptainJax> Oh God he doesn't know about THE CHART
[2:59:20] <%heartlesshealer> WAIT PAT STOP ON THE COLONY RELATIONSHIPS
[2:59:20] <%GabeSweetMan> Shove gifts down gift holes.
[2:59:21] <+jiggy_snipe> I mean the other characters are fun to play as
[2:59:23] <+alphonseisbest> JUST DO QUESTS
[2:59:25] <SubjectTea> doing side quests in the colony raises the affinity
[2:59:26] <+skylerpilot> you don't need Shulk in the party
[2:59:27] <%ringabal> Just watch the scenes on Youtube when you're done
[2:59:27] <%ShawnTK_> oh hell no, specific NPCs show up depending on the time
[2:59:27] <Futurecity10> Just do quests
[2:59:29] <theanora1> You gain affinity with all of the town NPCs too
[2:59:30] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> people are active at different times of the day
[2:59:39] <natertot1> Quests are good for you
[2:59:42] <%mrzeeks> mrzeeks subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Was just rewatching your discussion about Mass Effect playthrough with paige. Xbox accessories app has a co-pilot function. 2 controllers both control "player one"
[2:59:44] <OkamiDude15> @xeros720 it lets you see extra scenes between party members.
[2:59:45] <%heartlesshealer> The branches on colony relationships are only revealed on learning their relationship lore
[2:59:50] <+ATorL> NPC affinity isn't nearly the same as party affinity though
[2:59:50] <jellssssss20> Do the minimap icons change colour after talking to a person?
[2:59:50] <%xeros720> tldr just do sidequests
[2:59:51] <%StaceMcGate> no
[2:59:52] <DetroitSentai> No
[2:59:53] <Futurecity10> No
[2:59:54] <OkamiDude15> no

[2:59:59] <jellssssss20> no
[2:59:59] <%Movemeister> nope
[2:59:59] <%ahdurian> no
[2:59:59] <CappuccinoGuil> No, Pat, just give gifts
[2:59:59] <+VantomPayne> Next Podcast: "Xenoblade looks really good but 20 minutes in I cant play it anymore because things"
[3:00:01] <mak0t0yukii> No
[3:00:01] <%heartlesshealer> THINKING TOO MUCH
[3:00:02] <+alphonseisbest> nope
[3:00:06] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> in BATTLE
[3:00:07] <%StaceMcGate> NO
[3:00:07] <Onjani> No?
[3:00:08] <+D00msDayDan> this system seems bad
[3:00:09] <+Taisuru> Has nothing to do with quest turn in
[3:00:10] <%heartlesshealer> in BATTLE
[3:00:10] <jellssssss20> IN BATTLE
[3:00:10] <+alphonseisbest> WRONG
[3:00:11] <DetroitSentai> There's CITY affinity and PARTY affinity
[3:00:11] <dv9l> this game has phat content so you aint seen a pixel of the iceberg
[3:00:11] <%velemi> in BATTLE
[3:00:11] <+ATorL> that's for party characters
[3:00:11] <Nameless0100> The party leader usually gets the most
[3:00:13] <Vivirmos> Battle Affinity
[3:00:13] <hamiltin463> In combat
[3:00:13] <Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt I'ma dm you real quick
[3:00:14] <wrightlight94> in battle
[3:00:15] <%MisterRockett> The party leader gains the most more easily.
[3:00:15] <BallerSwagBro9k> WAKE ME UP INSIDE
[3:00:16] <%ringabal> There's Party Affinity and NPC Affinity
[3:00:16] <+dave323dave> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:00:16] <SubjectTea> party affinity and colony affinity are completely separate
[3:00:19] <+alphonseisbest> IN BATTLE
[3:00:20] <%ShawnTK_> affinity is between 2 characters
[3:00:21] <olaksi> contrarian yes
[3:00:23] <%cvp5127> NotLikeThis
[3:00:24] <+alphonseisbest> NOT QUESTS
[3:00:24] <grimshuck> God dammit it doesn't really matter
[3:00:24] <%ringabal> OH LOOK VIDEOGAME
[3:00:26] <%heartlesshealer> BATTLE IS LEADER ONLY. Gifts are whatever
[3:00:26] <%lilytastic> why is it so complicated lmao
[3:00:27] <%bevyrage> don't forget that depending on the time in-game different people show up, so you have to do multiple runs through the zone to talk to everyone. you also link the colony by garnering info. AFFINITY IS GAINED IN BATTLE FROM THE PARTY LEADER PAT
[3:00:29] <dinnydanny777> ITS REYN TIME
[3:00:30] <%Movemeister> ITS REYN TIME
[3:00:32] <tolloponik> Groos theme Plays
[3:00:33] <%GabeSweetMan> Pat, ask on the Discord later so A person can explain it to you.
[3:00:33] <+nintega010> is this pats first time playing Xenoblade?
[3:00:35] <+alphonseisbest> QUESTS ARE ALL PARTY MEMBERS
[3:00:38] <%TheFramedWarlock> REYN TIME
[3:00:40] <%spiritofmojave> NOW ITS REYN TIME
[3:00:43] <damnvier> everyone gets a little hearth if you press the button right in combat

[3:00:45] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, for christ's sake, just try giving a gift as soon as this cutscene is done
[3:00:45] <%filialpails> JUST LET GO IDIOT
[3:00:46] <%Nupinoop296> good job Reyn
[3:00:47] <Cdjgamer> MURDERER
[3:00:47] <+ATorL> NPC/Town affinity isn't related to any of the party members, but the party as a whole.
[3:00:48] <%Valdorick> Its Reyn Time
[3:00:49] <+VantomPayne> DEAD
[3:00:49] <%GabeSweetMan> DED

[3:01:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> punch him
[3:01:06] <+Promessa_EX> her guts should be on the ground lol
[3:01:09] <%xeros720> it bounced off her
[3:01:11] <vinnnyaraujo> My best advise would be to forget abou the afinnity system as it doesnt affect the game too much...when you remember about it later,you will have a better understanding
[3:01:14] <j0ustar> F
[3:01:16] <+nintega010> @detroitsentai it's not hard it's real fine
[3:01:16] <chronoxgp> it recognized her

[3:03:54] <%Sokumotanaka> @vinnnyaraujo that's an insult to this amazing game
[3:03:55] <chronoxgp> the fucking sword was built in the end of time and came out a black hole
[3:03:57] <FoolproofDread> THE REAPERS HAVE POSESSED THE MONADO
[3:03:57] <+ATorL> that's not even close to the part that matters
[3:04:00] <SubjectTea> M O N A D O
[3:04:01] <%scrumbotime> "Who knows, maybe Shulk is straight up psychic?"
[3:04:08] <dinnydanny777> Shulk has literally been using it
[3:04:10] <%ElenaManetta> bitchhh
[3:04:11] <+ATorL> the important shit is backloaded
[3:04:17] <SubjectTea> with a 12 year difference
[3:04:22] <jellssssss20> Wait he gets magic future sight? why would he not want that
[3:04:24] <dinnydanny777> Yeah but it's fine if she's adopted cause Japan right?

[3:04:41] <%Sokumotanaka> This is a weird episode of That's so raven.
[3:04:44] <%GohanHitsugaya> It still hasn't been answerd.
[3:04:46] <vinnnyaraujo> @sokumotanaka oh I know...but when I saw ff7r did something similar I laughed how dumb it was FF7R

[3:05:02] <%redrins> reyn is HUGE
[3:05:09] <ToneBacas> looks like an Overwatch character
[3:05:11] <damnvier> rein looks so cartoony =(
[3:05:14] <dinnydanny777> Reyn's trousers are weird
[3:05:14] <%Sokumotanaka> @vinnnyaraujo That's also a weird episode of that's so raven
[3:05:14] <SubjectTea> I wish i had a six pack like reyn
[3:05:15] <%ElenaManetta> This is such a weird transition to finding a magic sword
[3:05:16] <chronoxgp> that doesn't explain his upper body
[3:05:17] <%Starotter70> The clap of Reyns Asscheecks keeps alerting the mechon
[3:05:17] <+ATorL> Nomura isn't a great story teller.
[3:05:21] <CappuccinoGuil> God Reyn, you're such an idiot, I love you
[3:05:30] <dv9l> GOD SHULK LOOKS SO SMALL NEXT TO REYN LIKE THAT
[3:05:39] <SubjectTea> @Starotter70 LUL

[3:05:44] <Greywolf47> WOW FIORA
[3:05:44] <%ringabal> "He's a twink, really."
[3:05:44] <%heartlesshealer> Shulk's a twink, Reyn
[3:05:46] <OkamiDude15> shut up its great
[3:05:47] <dinnydanny777> Reyn is a meathead
[3:05:47] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt i tweeted you an affinity guide since chat are indecisive
[3:05:48] <%Livelinne> psaHoldon
[3:05:49] <reonome> I SWEAR ON ME MUM
[3:05:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> "Shulk's dick is DELICATE. Only *I* can handle it!"
[3:05:50] <BallerSwagBro9k> ITS ACCURATE
[3:05:50] <Clowns> delicate
[3:05:51] <CappuccinoGuil> She ain't wrong, Shulk IS a glass cannon
[3:05:51] <%Starotter70> It's ok
[3:05:52] <%ElenaManetta> pat also hates it when paige calls him delicate
[3:05:52] <%Movemeister> wot you talki n about you slag
[3:05:56] <+CaptainJax> He's a bitch reyn
[3:05:56] <+terry_quest> just play gaem?
[3:05:56] <olaksi> I'm convinced the people who complain about the lack of beefcake have never touched video games
[3:05:57] <%heartlesshealer> IT'S FINE IT WAS DUMB AND OVERCOMPLICATED
[3:05:58] <%Valdorick> What a fucking Thief, needs a main tank to not pull threat off of.
[3:05:59] <$Dakuu75> I love how Fiora is straight up Like, "Shulk is sucha pussy"
[3:06:01] <Robot_Nixon_> caleb3Head wot u on abut
[3:06:01] <BallerSwagBro9k> git gud lum
[3:06:01] <twoto858> Don't worry about it
[3:06:02] <%Livelinne> LUL LUL
[3:06:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You can ignore it and just play the game
[3:06:04] <BallerSwagBro9k> lul
[3:06:04] <+alphonseisbest> U NEED TO CHILL PAT
[3:06:04] <DetroitSentai> Something that you work at over the game, not try and grind out
[3:06:04] <%GohanHitsugaya> Look, so long as no incest baby happens; then everything is fine. LUL
[3:06:06] <%redrins> someone will break it down on the discord or twitter, it;s FINE
[3:06:07] <grimshuck> Just look up a guide
[3:06:08] <chronoxgp> meg ryan
[3:06:09] <jellssssss20> It's okay Pat
[3:06:12] <$Draylle> dont worry about it during the early game @PatStaresAt
[3:06:13] <dinnydanny777> He literally sounded like Clemps there
[3:06:16] <tactician0> @PatStaresAt its fine don't worry about it
[3:06:17] <%valriot> Youll get it when you actually see the plot of the game @PatStaresAt
[3:06:17] <%furiousfurioso> it's just one of those systems for people to get super invested in for big play time, nothing essential
[3:06:20] <+Promessa_EX> not incest if you wear a condom
[3:06:22] <theanora1> The Affinity system is real bad if you're a completionist
[3:06:25] <FoolproofDread> "She Ruddhy wew doant. bloody wanker"
[3:06:25] <duel_pro> Just read the wiki page after the strem
[3:06:25] <Wielderofthetriforce> It's basically like FE's support system
[3:06:26] <CrypticMochi> Does this still have that weird thing where Riki and Sharla need low affinity with each other if you want optimal gem crafting?
[3:06:31] <suitangi021> Reyn is a good ride or die
[3:06:31] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> Has Pat said if this is a one-off stream?
[3:06:32] <Roach3s> bone upper Kreygasm
[3:06:32] <damnvier> don't look up a guide.. it will spoil the 7nth character...
[3:06:35] <OkamiDude15> @PatStaresAt its not something you need to worry about in the long run
[3:06:38] <%redrins> bone go upper
[3:06:41] <$Dakuu75> BONE UPPER, man that's lewd
[3:06:41] <%WhereIsWill> bone upper Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:06:42] <%BubbaRands> Bone Upper Kappa
[3:06:42] <doggieo> BONE UP HER
[3:06:47] <+CaptainJax> BONE UPPA
[3:06:48] <%moogleboy1984> Bone Upper? shasPlot shasPlot shasPlot
[3:06:51] <vinnnyaraujo> boner uppe BrokeBack
[3:06:51] <chronoxgp> from onw on the game is all about bey blades
[3:06:55] <Nameless0100> Basically, party members gain affinity by being together. The leader usually gets more because the chances of gaining affinity from both the other members are higher. You can also use gifts
[3:06:58] <Roach3s> BONU UPPA
[3:06:59] <%heartlesshealer> I hope the low affinity for good crafting crap is gone
[3:07:00] <jellssssss20> Bone Upper? I hardly knew her?
[3:07:00] <theanora1> Back Slash is super good
[3:07:00] <%SirGO0SE> bone her up Kreygasm
[3:07:01] <dv9l> why look up a guide when the game has a guide in itself already
[3:07:11] <dinnydanny777> If the game is about beyblade when do we unlock the Moses spirit animal and part the red sea?
[3:07:14] <DXLelouch24> @damnvier no it wont, not the one i tweeted anyways
[3:07:23] <FodderAplenty> Do you plan on playing as the other characters?
[3:07:23] <damnvier> okay :)
[3:07:28] <SlashingIce> Just use gifts. It's far more efficient for affinity.
[3:07:30] <%ringabal> We in there
[3:07:37] <lordzaskez> back there is another
[3:07:37] <jellssssss20> Get your mmo quests
[3:07:39] <+ATorL> IT'S THE QUESTS EVERYWHERE SYSTEM
[3:07:40] <+JerseyBleek> how is the military out of gas for their artillery
[3:07:40] <chronoxgp> @dinnydanny777 you don't need moses, you need ivan's cloack
[3:07:41] <%skelechief> Wasn't this game referred to as a "Single-Player MMO" or some shit?
[3:07:43] <chronoxgp> wind
[3:07:43] <natertot1> theres more quest in the military base too
[3:07:47] <%Meltdown547> The Paigeisms are getting in there deep.
[3:07:49] <%filialpails> there was a ! to the north
[3:07:50] <DetroitSentai> Just play as who you want
[3:07:52] <+ViewtifulCrow> when do you get the sword
[3:07:53] <tactician0> its reyn time
[3:07:56] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> @PatStaresAt Is this a one off stream of the game?
[3:08:02] <+alphonseisbest> Shulk's fun 2 use
[3:08:04] <gordieda20> REYN TIME
[3:08:04] <dinnydanny777> Alley Ooo
[3:08:07] <+alphonseisbest> i get it
[3:08:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> Just give all the Affinity to Chrono, WHAT COULD GO WRONG?
[3:08:07] <Greywolf47> ALLEYOOP
[3:08:08] <damnvier> alle-lup
[3:08:09] <CappuccinoGuil> You should play around with all characters for a bit, they are all fun and unique
[3:08:10] <%redrins> highly recommend using rikki melia and dunban, they are fun as fuck
[3:08:12] <%GohanHitsugaya> Pat, put everyone in their underwear! Also, you can pick up more quests at night.
[3:08:12] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt i tweeted you an affinity guide, its not as hard to raise it as you think
[3:08:13] <%Starotter70> Early game makes it very easy to only use Shulk
[3:08:13] <%ringabal> Jeez that's just an Organization 13 weapon
[3:08:16] <jellssssss20> Auto run? That seems useful
[3:08:18] <%heartlesshealer> Yeah, just give everyone a quick try, get their jump grunts out
[3:08:18] <twoto858> Affinity bs aside
[3:08:19] <theanora1> It doesn't mater until you get like 4 characters if you play as others
[3:08:23] <$valkuma> I think Xenoblade is cool but i absolutely cant stand their awful VA
[3:08:24] <%xeros720> pat quality stream
[3:08:25] <+alphonseisbest> oh that sucks
[3:08:27] <tactician0> full play through when
[3:08:30] <theanora1> and the AI is real bad as Shulk
[3:08:34] <Lmsd944> I got about 3/4 of the way through the 3DS version before i dropped it
[3:08:35] <FodderAplenty> Guys what are the yellow icons?
[3:08:36] <dinnydanny777> Ally Oooo
[3:08:41] <%Starotter70> Alley Ooop
[3:08:44] <+alphonseisbest> i whated to see pat'js reaction 2 later stuff
[3:08:44] <%StaceMcGate> Xenoblade 1 VA is great, Xenoblade 2 VA is a mess
[3:08:46] <Nameless0100> @valkuma When in doubt, switch to JP
[3:08:47] <olaksi> bully Pat into streaming full play through, thanks
[3:08:49] <noredeemingvalue> is the combat different from chronicles 2? I tried to get into that game but I just couldn't get past how passive it was
[3:08:51] <+alphonseisbest> wanted
[3:08:52] <chronoxgp> tephras
[3:08:54] <chronoxgp> demon
[3:08:54] <%ringabal> Whata buncha jokahs
[3:08:56] <dinnydanny777> Is this another animal that's just minding it's own business?
[3:08:59] <Lmsd944> Dont know if its worth picking back up again
[3:09:00] <Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt I dm'ed you a full explanation of the affinity system as clean as possible
[3:09:06] <%heartlesshealer> Did I hear Shulk jump to optimize his pathing????
[3:09:11] <CrypticMochi> Kinda annoyed Melia’s AI can’t stack for shit
[3:09:14] <vinnnyaraujo> xenoblade 1 Dub Va is thousand times better than the JP one
[3:09:15] <WRFWD> Remember to use fast travel whenever you want, it's instantaneous when you travel inside the same area
[3:09:26] <jellssssss20> Another or two or three
[3:09:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> Eder from Pillars would fit in perfectly here
[3:09:33] <%fredbet96> Sup everyone
[3:09:38] <Quasiplaying> !uptime
[3:09:39] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 9m.
[3:09:44] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt also tweeted you an indepth affinity guide
[3:09:49] <+ATorL> XB2 VA isn't that bad overall. There are some bad performances but for the main cast it's just that Rex's VA doesn't do yelling very well. Otherwise it's fine.
[3:09:59] <suitangi021> You only need to play as Shulk early game so it's easier setup topples
[3:10:05] <CappuccinoGuil> @ATorL Rex is attrocious D:
[3:10:05] <FoolproofDread> glitch through a wall for her
[3:10:07] <BoneBagMel> are u telling me pat is "hot" with a 18°C weather?
[3:10:08] <chronoxgp> thank god i bought project diva instead
[3:10:18] <Plugman86> so is this a one off?
[3:10:20] <chronoxgp> i want robot voices for my VA
[3:10:34] <Ultimatefool> Canadians are specced into cold resist
[3:10:46] <jellssssss20> ^
[3:10:49] <%heartlesshealer> Basement kitchens get heated
[3:10:56] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> its too bad eng VA isnt lip synced
[3:11:03] <+ATorL> @CappuccinoGuil I think he's fine when the script doesn't call for shouts. Then again I played Arc Rise Fantasia through twice, so I think my bar for awful VA work has been permanently skewed.
[3:11:05] <vinnnyaraujo> I've hear that the definitive version fixed some of the dumb A.I problems(from a interview I guess),but I am not sure myself
[3:11:07] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah think this is just a "Let's take a look at this"
[3:11:09] <+xBolts4Lifex> music is really nice
[3:11:22] <chronoxgp> im playing FF in jap
[3:11:23] <DetroitSentai> It doesnt matter
[3:11:23] <%BubbaRands> 60s is shorts weather for Cannucks
[3:11:23] <Nameless0100> You can still use gifts
[3:11:23] <%GohanHitsugaya> Those mascot characters are so cute
[3:11:23] <%ringabal> It's fine
[3:11:25] <%Valdorick> Nope, still do it.
[3:11:26] <Futurecity10> Its fine
[3:11:26] <olaksi> *shrug*
[3:11:27] <Nameless0100> It doesn't matter
[3:11:27] <Darren716> Just do them
[3:11:28] <OkamiDude15> pat it doesnt matter
[3:11:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's fine early game
[3:11:29] <+Taisuru> Gifts exist pat
[3:11:31] <%Starotter70> If you wanna really Min Max it
[3:11:33] <WRFWD> Walk to the entrance of the next area and then come back if you want to have all 3
[3:11:34] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt it makes it easier to wait for your 3rd party member
[3:11:35] <%heartlesshealer> I heard A.I. Shulk jump to fix his pathing and follow Pat, so that was probably improved
[3:11:35] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, the best way to get affinity is gifting
[3:11:38] <SlashingIce> Gifts are more important.
[3:11:38] <+Taisuru> It is
[3:11:39] <tactician0> it'll be fine for now
[3:11:40] <%Dr00_PhD> Stop worrying about you'll just make it worse for yourself
[3:11:40] <FoolproofDread> lies
[3:11:41] <Bluewind098> the affinity is only for the people you have in your active party
[3:11:43] <jellssssss20> okay...
[3:11:43] <Ultimatefool> It's fine, there are literally 500 side quests
[3:11:43] <olaksi> Nopon suck ass
[3:11:46] <vinnnyaraujo> nah...there are like 27286668628133 other quests to do
[3:11:47] <hamiltin463> There are so many quests its fine
[3:11:52] <%GabeSweetMan> Shove gifts into gift holes.
[3:11:54] <Greywolf47> Oh no he's gonna be spoiled
[3:12:01] <%SirGO0SE> oo i just realized Pat's AC must not have been fixed yeterday, shit
[3:12:04] <dinnydanny777> That's really detailed
[3:12:15] <+R_BChe> ?????????
[3:12:16] <DetroitSentai> That seems simpl;e
[3:12:19] <%fredbet96> aounds like an RPG
[3:12:19] <+ATorL> how is that not simple
[3:12:21] <Futurecity10> HOW WAS THAT COMPICATED
[3:12:22] <+alphonseisbest> IT IS THO
[3:12:23] <%redrins> ?????
[3:12:23] <+natjen8> it seems simple but tedious
[3:12:23] <$Dakuu75> welcome to affinity-school
[3:12:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's pretty simple man
[3:12:24] <SainEdge> ???
[3:12:24] <@SoFarFetched> @SirGO0SE yeah shit unfortunately went bad yesterday.
[3:12:25] <%Starotter70> How?
[3:12:25] <FoolproofDread> shove thick, meaty gifts into their awaiting gift holes
[3:12:25] <reonome> thats pretty simple pat
[3:12:25] <%velemi> its..... not?????
[3:12:28] <+apocplz> ???
[3:12:28] <%Ninestempest> it's just "play the game" dummy
[3:12:29] <dv9l> NotLikeThis
[3:12:29] <DetroitSentai> You get city xp for doing quests
[3:12:30] <%afronooch> LUL
[3:12:30] <Onjani> ???
[3:12:31] <%Meltdown547> "Give gift, get affinity" is what I hear.
[3:12:32] <+alphonseisbest> THAT SOUNDS SIMPLE AF TO ME
[3:12:32] <+Taisuru> It's very simple dummy
[3:12:33] <%heartlesshealer> It's simple to Visualize, but in words it's just a big mess
[3:12:33] <%AncelDeLambert> that's super simple. That's "Fuck it, do whatever and eventually it'll go up"
[3:12:34] <%xeros720> what's the complicated part?
[3:12:34] <%StaceMcGate> ITS SO SIMPLE LUL
[3:12:34] <FodderAplenty> Guys am i right in saying the yellow icons on the map indicate new dialogue?
[3:12:35] <Geoblood> i think its easier than it sounds pat
[3:12:35] <%valriot> PAT ITS JUST GRINDING
[3:12:35] <%R3Roundabout> How can you get confused by this
[3:12:36] <zk_nails> just have everyone just give stuff to everyone
[3:12:36] <CrypticMochi> How?
[3:12:36] <%redrins> pat thats so simple why are you like this psaGoblin
[3:12:37] <%Zeahk> psaJpeg
[3:12:38] <+Taisuru> GIFTS EXIST PAT
[3:12:38] <%SirGO0SE> @SoFarFetched to twitter I go to likely be appalled.
[3:12:39] <tactician0> @PatStaresAt it'll work its self out
[3:12:39] <hamiltin463> There are so many quests its fine
[3:12:40] <+Dr_DangerPhD> play as different characters or give gifts pat
[3:12:40] <BallerSwagBro9k> Its almost like this was an OVERATED game
[3:12:40] <%Sokumotanaka> goblings
[3:12:41] <Futurecity10> This affinity is so nothing it doesnt matter
[3:12:41] <OkamiDude15> @PatStaresAt just dont worry about it
[3:12:41] <olaksi> Literally everything is simple, in the universe
[3:12:42] <Lmsd944> just play the game haha
[3:12:44] <DetroitSentai> ITS AFFINITY WITH THE TOWN
[3:12:44] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt read the guide i tweeted you. THAT is NOT the only way FUTURE CITY
[3:12:44] <glass_marcus> Play the game until friends
[3:12:46] <%GabeSweetMan> Pat read but not understand.
[3:12:46] <%Pengers> maybe you should wait
[3:12:47] <CappuccinoGuil> PAT, YOU CAN FARM AFFINITY BY GIFTING
[3:12:48] <%hotdough> sounds simple but very very long
[3:12:48] <+alphonseisbest> H ow is it not simple???
[3:12:50] <%GohanHitsugaya> It is complicated, and annoying.
[3:12:50] <suitangi021> Just play gifts will cover affinity
[3:12:51] <DXLelouch24> im staring at the guide
[3:12:51] <%cvp5127> NotLikeThis
[3:12:52] <jellssssss20> Just say ah fuck it
[3:12:54] <$Dakuu75> sounds like it doesn't matter what you do because you can just gift-spam them later
[3:12:54] <vinnnyaraujo> oh god....i hope the guide doesnt spoil the game to him...I got spoiled originally for looking up guides and asking too many quests back on the day
[3:12:55] <ppi1993> its literally just number go up
[3:12:59] <%R3Roundabout> This bit stopped being funny a while ago
[3:12:59] <%MisterRockett> You don't get 3rd member for another 15 hours so there's no point in waiting.
[3:13:00] <Calek> @PatStaresAt that's the attitude to have Pat! just say whatever and move on!
[3:13:00] <%skelechief> You can farm affinity by gifting so don't worrya bout it
[3:13:04] <%GohanHitsugaya> Extremely annoying...
[3:13:04] <%GarbageNirvana> Ryne quite flexing on this kid
[3:13:05] <%GabeSweetMan> Affinity can be farmed. Don't bother worrying.
[3:13:08] <olaksi> Then again nothing is simple
[3:13:11] <%valriot> Just stop associating it with Social Links
[3:13:11] <dinnydanny777> All-y Ooooo-p
[3:13:13] <+alphonseisbest> ally upp
[3:13:14] <%heartlesshealer> 1200 money
[3:13:16] <CrypticMochi> It’s just grinding on the party leaders nutz in battle and stuff
[3:13:17] <%scrumbotime> Give Gift, Get Affinity, everything else, Quest accepting, battle, etc, is Piddly Baby Numbers compared to Gifts.
[3:13:24] <damnvier> Alley Ooop
[3:13:25] <+shivhappy22> Time is convoluted in Lordran
[3:13:28] <%hotdough> red is quest item
[3:13:28] <+ATorL> THAT DOESN'T MATTER
[3:13:30] <redapache> @patstaresat you want relationships to be simple?
[3:13:30] <Futurecity10> It literally didnt do anything
[3:13:34] <chronoxgp> dying light 2 isn't a game yet
[3:13:36] <%Valdorick> Pat! YOU CAN GIVE GIFTS! WHICH ARE UNLIMITED
[3:13:37] <%Livelinne> And I oop
[3:13:49] <FoolproofDread> Rally loop
[3:13:55] <%GabeSweetMan> Chat, did that convo matter? It seemed like she was gonna react negatively no matter what option you choose.
[3:13:57] <Ultimatefool> It's completely fine, the heart to hearts are just bonus scenes that you can replay
[3:13:57] <duel_pro> You can view them again in the event viewer
[3:13:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Gifts are the most efficient way to farm affinity, don't worry too much otherwise
[3:14:00] <DXLelouch24> you can also save scum fashion unlocks, just buy then reload
[3:14:00] <%valriot> You didnt fuck it up
[3:14:03] <%heartlesshealer> The actual scenes are for roleplay
[3:14:04] <olaksi> @redapache yes pelease
[3:14:05] <IrateRapScallion> Affinity is not a limited resource. You don't have to min/max it. You can always just gift items or just fight more.
[3:14:07] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt You know how Persona gives you more affinity for social links if you pick the right dialouge? That
[3:14:14] <tactician0> that one plays out like that regardless of what you choose @PatStaresAt so no worries
[3:14:14] <WRFWD> ROLEPLAY
[3:14:22] <%heartlesshealer> ROLE
[3:14:24] <%AncelDeLambert> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:14:29] <Ultimatefool> You could in the original
[3:14:35] <natertot1> Messing up the first heart to heart is fine you get an achievement for fucking up and the difference in affinity gained is fairly minimal
[3:14:37] <duel_pro> go to the event viewer
[3:14:38] <+ATorL> The only thing you get for doing H2H's "well" the first time is a little bonus affinity afterward. They're literally just events for a bit of fun character development.
[3:14:45] <%GabeSweetMan> He's feeling it... but is he REALLY feeling it?
[3:14:48] <reonome> I'M REALLY FEELING IT
[3:14:49] <dinnydanny777> B A C K S L A S H
[3:14:54] <CappuccinoGuil> Alright, time to show your FF14 tank skills, Pat
[3:14:57] <%heartlesshealer> the grass is so good
[3:15:01] <chronoxgp> XENOBLADE PACHINKO
[3:15:01] <hamiltin463> I think they are in the menu somewhere
[3:15:04] <olaksi> Stance!
[3:15:08] <%Shadicara> GET STUCK IN
[3:15:11] <dinnydanny777> I'm really peeling it
[3:15:11] <Hazard_Kujacker> Yo guys, HE'S REALLY STEALING IT
[3:15:12] <gordieda20> Alright I'm feeling it
[3:15:25] <%heartlesshealer> It does a big hit
[3:15:26] <BallerSwagBro9k> Im feeling it too quiettAh
[3:15:32] <damnvier> Do you guys like Rayn or Wakka better?
[3:15:32] <%valriot> This is turning into a WoolieVS stream
[3:15:36] <Futurecity10> STOP WORRYING ABOUT AFFINITY
[3:15:37] <dinnydanny777> I'm really feeling this music
[3:15:37] <+Taisuru> I'm really feeling pats goblins
[3:15:38] <CappuccinoGuil> Affinity from battle yes
[3:15:38] <%GohanHitsugaya> I think you can replay them, but I don't think it changes what you chose.
[3:15:40] <%Starotter70> The Quick time raises Tension
[3:15:46] <cureneckbeard> I'M REALLY FEELING IT
[3:15:47] <OkamiDude15> it increases tension at the start of battle
[3:15:48] <%GabeSweetMan> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:15:50] <theanora1> I think those slow ATB things raise affinity and tell the other party member to use moves
[3:15:52] <chronoxgp> reyn is that elf mage, i like her better than shulk
[3:15:55] <natertot1> the circle is starting tension for the battle
[3:15:56] <KingVantq> i dont know how i feel about the combat in this, maybe because I havent played it tdogLurk
[3:15:57] <+Taisuru> Taisuru subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[3:15:58] <%Shadicara> Yeah raises pat's goblin tension LUL
[3:16:00] <+apocplz> mindgoblins working overtime today
[3:16:00] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt just keep playing, i gaind plenty just from playing and i beat it when it was on wii
[3:16:01] <%ringabal> He's feeling it, but not really
[3:16:02] <+Lost_Zombie> Pat had an easier time with warhammer
[3:16:11] <+ATorL> Every successful QTE in battle generates a small amount of affinity between the party leader and the character the QTE was with.
[3:16:16] <%Taisuru> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:16:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> ArE yOu FeELiNg It Mr KrAbS!?
[3:16:24] <%Taisuru> FOR THE PARTY LEADER
[3:16:25] <%Aydarkzero> LUL
[3:16:27] <OkamiDude15> its been a while

[3:16:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> ARt thou fEeling it NOW, Mr kRAbs?
[3:16:46] <%walternatorz> this is a bit now, right?..
[3:16:46] <gluttonousmimic> I'm really feeling it. I'm really feeling it! I'm Really Feeling It! I'M REALLY FEELING IT!!! AAAGGH!!!
[3:16:49] <%heartlesshealer> Battle START AFFINITY and also BURST AFFINITY. Game just loves the damn word
[3:16:57] <Futurecity10> I now know how pat feels when he's tutoring paige
[3:17:00] <DXLelouch24> Pat you play MMOs, you should be use to learningthis many systems at once
[3:17:00] <%skelechief> AHHH NOT THE GOBLINS ANYTHING BUT THE GOBLINS psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:17:00] <dv9l> reading? in my ROLEPLAYING GAME? happens more often than youd think
[3:17:03] <+SinisterBroccoli> Remember when Pat was talking about not being angry anymore at the beginning of the stream?
[3:17:03] <chronoxgp> do you know people played this game on a controller plugged into a wii mote???
[3:17:05] <DXLelouch24> like FF14
[3:17:10] <+PenmanLupine> this is not a game for the brain goblined
[3:17:12] <natertot1> why do you not understand this game as me?
[3:17:16] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> breathe pat
[3:17:18] <%Shadicara> All you need to know pat is it's reyn time that's it
[3:17:32] <FoolproofDread> Touch their butts to gain affinity
[3:17:34] <%heartlesshealer> Listen to the Rulebook in purple text
[3:17:34] <dinnydanny777> Just Really Peel It
[3:17:36] <%Meltdown547> I haven't played this, but can someone get numbers on how much gifts give compared to battle affinity so I assume Pat can stop caring about battle gained affinity?
[3:17:36] <GeltonZ> Poor Pat.
[3:17:37] <duel_pro> save and go to the title screen to view heart to hearts
[3:17:37] <maazmutable> You can do this Pat. Just Remember, Everyone on Earth is Cheering Your Name.
[3:18:25] <%Starotter70> @Meltdown547 I know there's a guide for Gifts on the wiki
[3:18:29] <OkamiDude15> pick the skill tree for your playstyle
[3:18:30] <+ATorL> No one tell him about the skill sharing mechanic later in the game.
[3:18:49] <chronoxgp> i forgot you cant name people in this
[3:18:50] <FoolproofDread> Game design notes: make the concept of friendship more difficult than beating the final boss
[3:18:53] <%mister___doctor> Pat, make your party naked already
[3:18:57] <chronoxgp> i would name red head NOva or something
[3:18:58] <+PenmanLupine> @ATorL he won't get there. its fine
[3:19:01] <damnvier> you want to get heavy equipment if you can ;)
[3:19:08] <%heartlesshealer> maybe
[3:19:13] <FoolproofDread> ALLEY OOP
[3:19:15] <%Shadicara> I keep forgetting how deceptive xenoblade is with how loaded it is
[3:19:15] <WRFWD> Don't worry, just learn everything and it will be fine
[3:19:17] <tactician0> you did it pat
[3:19:21] <jfp4life> yeah you got it
[3:19:26] <+PortableBoredom> Why not have the game fill the whole screen if you don't have a camera on anyway
[3:19:26] <FodderAplenty> You did it :>
[3:19:29] <OkamiDude15> its fine
[3:19:32] <Nameless0100> No worries
[3:19:33] <%Starotter70> It's ok
[3:19:37] <%maenos2> pat flustered
[3:19:37] <Vivirmos> All good
[3:19:38] <+SinisterBroccoli> Too hot?
[3:19:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> he had the weed
[3:19:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's fine, pretty understandable
[3:19:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> Reyn's got an omnitool you guys
[3:19:41] <%Shadicara> Pat it's too hot my brain is also melting
[3:19:42] <%heartlesshealer> It's fine, you had to save Paige three times earlier
[3:19:46] <tactician0> its fine pat
[3:19:46] <doggieo> Dont worry!
[3:19:47] <+Promessa_EX> stuff's rough, i'm basically a zombie today
[3:19:48] <%redrins> quite so yes, dont stress over it
[3:19:53] <%ElenaManetta> its hot
[3:19:55] <+JerseyBleek> @PatStaresAt you gonna stare at trials of mana?
[3:19:56] <%ElenaManetta> pat's got the heat stroke
[3:19:58] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt i looked it up you can just give gifts for big affinity gains. No Worries
[3:20:00] <%Livelinne> psaUp psaUp psaUp
[3:20:04] <+Promessa_EX> it feels like i just got here and it's been 3hours20
[3:20:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> They did apparently
[3:20:06] <%MisterRockett> No it's the same. You just never switched off of them
[3:20:07] <%Shadicara> XC2 SYSTEM BABY
[3:20:11] <+ATorL> The real test will be if the AI can play Melia
[3:20:12] <%Starotter70> The AI in the original game was hit or miss, depending on the character
[3:20:12] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh man, did they? IS MELIA AI POSSIBLE NOW? PogChamp
[3:20:13] <%Valdorick> twails awf manaw
[3:20:14] <$Dakuu75> did he jsut say "Shulk on this"?
[3:20:14] <%Ninestempest> he absolutely did, i played like 1/3rd of the game as melia
[3:20:19] <WRFWD> Maybe they improved it but he will still use Monado arts like a madman
[3:20:21] <%cvp5127> it has been a decade
[3:20:26] <%MisterRockett> The entire topple break daze system revolves around the AI doing it when they have a chance.
[3:20:27] <%Daniel_Is_I> Melia AI was absolutely moronic
[3:20:27] <%mister___doctor> Shulks A.I is really feeling it this time
[3:20:32] <DXLelouch24> if Melia Ai is possible and its confirmed by my friend shes still OP as Fuck
[3:20:34] <DXLelouch24> 0.0
[3:20:34] <FodderAplenty> It may be as simple as the art being on cooldown
[3:20:35] <%Valdorick> He's getting stuck in.
[3:20:37] <OkamiDude15> @WRFWD oh god
[3:20:42] <%Starotter70> Melia was one of the best party memebers, but her AI was TRASH
[3:20:47] <%AncelDeLambert> this combat is so dull, man
[3:20:52] <chronoxgp> SUCC
[3:20:54] <%Shadicara> TIME FOR PAIN - Literally pat with the systems Kappa
[3:20:56] <%Valdorick> Tank! The DPS has threat!
[3:21:05] <%Shadicara> Kill rabbot for more power
[3:21:13] <DXLelouch24> @AncelDeLambert it gets better later, this is basically the prologue
[3:21:14] <%코코꾸라> Nine Top PogChamp
[3:21:16] <+ATorL> Melia and 7 were my favorites to play as.
[3:21:16] <FoolproofDread> Eat this suck focus
[3:21:20] <natertot1> no
[3:21:20] <CappuccinoGuil> @AncelDeLambert There's a lot of decisions to be made, but also it's the beginning of the game
[3:21:21] <WRFWD> No
[3:21:22] <chronoxgp> ohhh tephra hill named after a bible wind spirit
[3:21:24] <tactician0> yes
[3:21:24] <OkamiDude15> no
[3:21:24] <WRFWD> This is new
[3:21:28] <Mikizi> Why are RPG character talking constantly during fights? I wish video games would just shut up some times.
[3:21:31] <WRFWD> Now every quest is marked
[3:21:36] <redapache> Can't wait to see the level 70 enemies roaming around
[3:21:40] <WRFWD> Even the random collectable items are marked
[3:21:40] <tolloponik> so how dose the game fair compared to XC X
[3:21:41] <OkamiDude15> you just had to go off what their name was
[3:21:42] <%GabeSweetMan> psaCrazyhand
[3:21:46] <%vectorless_peon> pat we're talking about how you want to shit a dry birck once a week in discord any comments?
[3:21:53] <%MisterRockett> It's the whole party.
[3:21:56] <%AncelDeLambert> guys, I don't think MMO style combat is going to get better later on. Pretty sure it's still gonna be MMO stuff
[3:21:57] <DXLelouch24> everyone
[3:21:57] <%Valdorick> The party as a whole
[3:21:58] <%MisterRockett> It just shows whoever is the leader.
[3:22:00] <OkamiDude15> whole party
[3:22:02] <natertot1> its for the whole party
[3:22:02] <Ultimatefool> It's everyone
[3:22:02] <DXLelouch24> the whole party
[3:22:04] <%Shadicara> Everyone my guy
[3:22:04] <+ATorL> WHOLE PARTY, IT'S OKAY PAT
[3:22:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just shows party leader
[3:22:06] <%Starotter70> Just because of the leader
[3:22:07] <WRFWD> It's because he's the leader, counts for everyone
[3:22:10] <%ShawnTK_> the affinities with towns are just 1 value, meaning it's for the whole party
[3:22:11] <%Shadicara> LUL
[3:22:13] <zk_nails> town affinity is with everyone
[3:22:13] <DXLelouch24> PAT I SENT YOU A GUIDE DAMMIT
[3:22:14] <%Shadicara> GOBLIN
[3:22:14] <CappuccinoGuil> It's because reyn was the leader
[3:22:14] <chronoxgp> Raiyen?i
[3:22:14] <tactician0> its because the party leader
[3:22:15] <chronoxgp> Ryan
[3:22:16] <%luckysteak> @Mikizi It is an indicator of what they are doing. it is helpful to hear what is going on when things get confusing in battle
[3:22:19] <chronoxgp> Reign
[3:22:21] <DXLelouch24> read it then be calm
[3:22:21] <redapache> Pat relationships don't matter
[3:22:26] <%Valdorick> The unit that is called "party", the town likes the group, not the people inside it.
[3:22:27] <+alphonseisbest> Pat just chill, its all good
[3:22:29] <%Daniel_Is_I> I think Pat is having a meltdown
[3:22:29] <%Keaton_x> I have 100k Pat Points and nothing to use them on so have a random highlighted message: Remember to stay well hydrated in the heat, especially with the lack of AC.
[3:22:30] <+PenmanLupine> I can feel Pat's blood pressure rising from here
[3:22:33] <jellssssss20> His face is the icon for the team when he's the leader
[3:22:39] <Mikizi> @luckysteak there's gotta be a better way
[3:22:39] <%xeros720> pat is super confused by mmo faction mechanics
[3:22:40] <BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat I beat the game without even knowing about AFFINITY its not a necessary mechanic
[3:22:50] <CrypticMochi> Pat needs something cold
[3:23:03] <%AncelDeLambert> I want pat to put a high point reward in that's just stupid bullshit. Like it cuts to an animation of Elmo licking himself if you spend 100k
[3:23:05] <+TomDanksEGOT> You lterally just read that doing side quests increased settlement affinity with THE LEADER
[3:23:07] <%Shadicara> LUL
[3:23:16] <+ATorL> deadly bunny
[3:23:17] <%luckysteak> @Mikizi true, but I don't know what would work better inthis system
[3:23:18] <tactician0> tank buster
[3:23:19] <damnvier> level 3 against level 4 bunnys
[3:23:19] <%mister___doctor> Pat it's not called "XenoFriend Chronicles" you can put off the affinity stuff
[3:23:20] <%Shadicara> Least he still got exp
[3:23:22] <CappuccinoGuil> Levels matter in this game. A LOT
[3:23:23] <+Qits> Reyn just got whopped by a rabbit with a stick
[3:23:25] <cureneckbeard> I don't know that Pat's really feeling it
[3:23:25] <olaksi> Tank down, abort abort
[3:23:36] <WRFWD> Healing is going to be fucked until you find Sharla
[3:23:40] <theanora1> This affinity system is going to be a CSB episode, isn't it?
[3:23:42] <%luckysteak> blue means they are a few levels below you
[3:23:43] <%M4T1A5> I think pat has left himself at level 3
[3:23:43] <%Shadicara> The fact everyone gets exp as long as you WIN is great
[3:23:44] <+RoByte2> Healer adjust
[3:23:53] <%Starotter70> The color shows how far they are from you level wise
[3:23:55] <damnvier> i mean, shulk HAS healing
[3:24:02] <+ATorL> Yeah, levels in XB games mean business, a lot like SMT games.
[3:24:04] <OkamiDude15> check that lightning
[3:24:06] <cureneckbeard> I'm really healing it!
[3:24:07] <+ATorL> Don't get cocky.

[3:24:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> The HARD R word
[3:24:55] <Calek> aren't level differences huge in this game, like being one or two under is a bad idea
[3:25:00] <%ringabal> Everybody gangsta until the rabbit gets the stick
[3:25:00] <%valriot> RUINED IT AAAAA
[3:25:02] <%Valdorick> FATE bunny.

[3:25:14] <dinnydanny777> Reyn, your a lifeshaver
[3:25:16] <%BubbaRands> dont fuck with the bun LUL
[3:25:16] <theanora1> Unique monsters are REALLY strong
[3:25:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Calek Indeed, gotta pick your fights sp,eto,es
[3:25:21] <CappuccinoGuil> That sucks, because unique enemy track is DOPE
[3:25:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> *sometimes
[3:25:29] <%luckysteak> pat, if you continue up the hill to the cave, you will get someone to make the bunny fight easier
[3:25:42] <+ATorL> @CappuccinoGuil The entire soundtrack is dope
[3:25:49] <CappuccinoGuil> @weissguard is that track only for unique or just higher level enemies?
[3:25:55] <CappuccinoGuil> @ATorL true that
[3:25:59] <%YakumoYomi> Pat is big...but not as big as Big Chungus
[3:26:01] <OkamiDude15> unique only i think

[3:26:09] <%Shadicara> I say this every time but whoever decided to have british voice actors in Xenoblade is a winner
[3:26:10] <theanora1> that said, once you hit about level 50, you can absolutely destroy most unique monsters
[3:26:11] <%luckysteak> the blue exclamation is for the active sidequest
[3:26:13] <vinnnyaraujo> i think unique only
[3:26:14] <%weissguard> @CappuccinoGuil I dunno. I
[3:26:17] <CappuccinoGuil> Unique is gone, I think. Must be a time of day thing
[3:26:18] <WRFWD> Blue icons are your tracked quest, red icons other quests, white icons quest you still haven't found
[3:26:23] <%weissguard> @CappuccinoGuil I've never played the game.

[3:28:05] <cureneckbeard> Did Pat get his air conditioning repaired yet
[3:28:06] <%Lunaticbro > 1 heart is "it's ok i guess"
[3:28:06] <natertot1> no they like it a little
[3:28:06] <%Valdorick> 1 heart means they like it, but don't love it
[3:28:07] <+Remery_> stroke him

[3:28:07] <%Garthunox> he got two black hearts
[3:28:08] <DXLelouch24> no it just means thats how many hearts it gives
[3:28:08] <+MediocreHermits> just ignore the party affinity system the games like 100 hours long look it up later yourself
[3:28:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Red heart is like, black heart is dislike
[3:28:10] <+alphonseisbest> THERE WERE 4 HEARTS!
[3:28:10] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> one means they like it a liiil bit. As a treat

[3:28:21] <Ultimatefool> 4 is loves it
[3:28:23] <alwayspronking> they like it a little
[3:28:25] <DetroitSentai> 4 is rare stuff
[3:28:26] <CappuccinoGuil> 1-4 hearts give affinity. Black heart means they hate it
[3:28:29] <%Shadicara> 4 means they're really feelin it
[3:28:32] <natertot1> 1 heart 4 times is equivelent to a 4 heart
[3:28:33] <$Dakuu75> you're killen me SMALLS
[3:28:39] <Mogel56> At 4 they're "REALLY FEELING IT!"

[3:31:06] <doggieo> UP
[3:31:07] <%thebeargoesHONK> i was really hoping for the Welsh cat women
[3:31:08] <OkamiDude15> net gain
[3:31:10] <$Draylle> run ruined
[3:31:11] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> think SOCIAL LINK
[3:31:11] <%Starotter70> It's fine
[3:31:13] <Quasiplaying> Net gain 0
[3:31:14] <%thetruenicster> I think as long as you got one right, it's good
[3:31:14] <LustrousEudemon> friends but not lovers
[3:31:15] <BallerSwagBro9k> This is NOT good game for Pat
[3:31:15] <Ultimatefool> Pat this system is lierally 100x more freeing than Persona, it's OKAY
[3:31:15] <natertot1> that was the 2nd best outcome
[3:31:16] <%heartlesshealer> Pat =T
[3:31:18] <Bluewind098> Chain Attacks are the main reason you'd care about Affinity. The higher Affinity a pair has the more likely you are to continue your Chain Attack. However if you have a comp you like they would naturally gain most affinity so don't worry about grinding it unless you like changing it up all the time
[3:31:20] <%DedlokPM> Green mogsSmeel
[3:31:20] <%heartlesshealer> it's fine
[3:31:25] <%xeros720> heart to hearts always give affinity
[3:31:26] <FoolproofDread> Rub more wasabi on his abs to make up the affinity
[3:31:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It only ever goes up, heart down just means less bonus
[3:31:29] <doggieo> The smiley faces are levels
[3:31:30] <tactician0> overall it was an increase
[3:31:32] <vinnnyaraujo> no....you just lost the oportunnity to gain morr
[3:31:44] <%Dr00_PhD> everytime i hear the work affinity now a piece of me dies
[3:31:50] <jfp4life> heart go up
[3:31:50] <%Garthunox> omg
[3:31:51] <Quasiplaying> Hearts
[3:31:52] <$Dakuu75> green is good?
[3:31:52] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Because I know this game extensively
[3:31:54] <%redrins> -1+1+1
[3:31:54] <%Shadicara> Heart go up
[3:31:55] <tactician0> you got 2 of 3
[3:31:57] <OkamiDude15> 4 down then 4 up then 1 up
[3:31:57] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> its an invisible number. like PERSONA
[3:31:58] <%redrins> Kappa
[3:31:59] <%heartlesshealer> there was a little side bar with the Reyn face
[3:32:02] <+alphonseisbest> CUZ THE HEARTS WENT UP
[3:32:03] <dinnydanny777> That xylophone is doing work in that song
[3:32:06] <%StaceMcGate> HOW DO YOU KNOW IN PERSONA?
[3:32:08] <%xeros720> datamining
[3:32:11] <+inopss> Is this pats first playthrough?
[3:32:11] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> PERSONA
[3:32:17] <%Starotter70> 4 went down, then 4 went up
[3:32:18] <%cylish> Its just a graphic
[3:32:19] <%heartlesshealer> THAT'S THE VISUAL EFFECT
[3:32:19] <%redrins> and up tons of hearts go up
[3:32:23] <%StaceMcGate> same thing here
[3:32:24] <+alphonseisbest> PAT UR OVER THINKING IT
[3:32:24] <%xeros720> pat, just read the fuckin wiki
[3:32:25] <Quasiplaying> Same thing then
[3:32:25] <Futurecity10> Hearts are the points
[3:32:26] <%Garthunox> same here
[3:32:27] <jfp4life> heart go up more than heart go down
[3:32:29] <tactician0> its never more loss than gain
[3:32:29] <%heartlesshealer> what matters is the side bar
[3:32:30] <%luckysteak> every heart is a poitn, big heart is worth more]
[3:32:32] <FoolproofDread> There was the little green face on the menu
[3:32:35] <TechGamer> Has Pat ever beaten Xenoblade? I remember long time ago you asked to borrow Wii version but never did
[3:32:39] <vinnnyaraujo> hearts are the points...you didnt see the hearts?
[3:32:42] <%cvp5127> its an equation
[3:32:42] <+alphonseisbest> ITS NOT LITERAL HERE MAN
[3:32:42] <$Dakuu75> 1 + 1 make 2
[3:32:46] <ShichiNoBushi> In Persona, notes appear above the confidant/S. Link's head.
[3:32:47] <Quasiplaying> Think of itas a +1 or -1
[3:32:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @TechGamer Nah, seems he only got to Eryth Sea
[3:32:56] <%Shadicara> If he's not he'll have fun playing through the story
[3:32:59] <%Dr00_PhD> they engaged with you first
[3:32:59] <OkamiDude15> you didnt get the charge because they initiated battle not you
[3:33:03] <%Starotter70> Because you didn't initiate the battle, the enemies did
[3:33:12] <WRFWD> You only get the button press before battle if you start it, they saw you first
[3:33:22] <Quasiplaying> @pat think of the hearts visuals as a +1 or -1
[3:33:40] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt how are you liking it so far?
[3:33:41] <duel_pro> your still in expert mode
[3:33:43] <tactician0> you'll lose as many as you could have gained if you get them all right or wrong
[3:33:43] <TechGamer> @Valentinius_Anodyne Ah ok thank you. For me I remember paying a lot to play this and honestly every dollar was worth it imo.
[3:33:50] <Saltmeisterr> omg that fiora line

[3:35:04] <%ringabal> Let's never speak of this again
[3:35:06] <%Mrbaconator> it's really hot and you have no AC it's fine

[3:35:14] <%DedlokPM> Pat is not really feeling it. doodSad
[3:35:14] <$Dakuu75> The HEAT-debuff is hitting Pat too hard, he has INT and WIS down
[3:35:17] <TechGamer> I love this graphic update. Even tho I find the orginal ok.
[3:35:18] <%bigboy3d> cmon pat it was good
[3:35:20] <%xeros720> hang in there goblin
[3:35:22] <%Livelinne> It’s FIIIINE
[3:35:23] <DetroitSentai> You just get it
[3:35:27] <%heartlesshealer> ????????
[3:35:28] <$Draylle> you lose your gamer cred
[3:35:29] <+alphonseisbest> YEAH 4 A JOKE
[3:35:31] <%ringabal> You GAIN your levels back
[3:35:34] <@SoFarFetched> I mean probably doesn't help with the stuff that happened yesterday,probably worrying about paige and A/C being off.
[3:35:36] <theanora1> Hopefully you come back to it, it's really good later
[3:35:37] <WRFWD> Use them before you turn it off
[3:35:37] <ergulor> Dunno man, it a nice little show of the game, besides to show it completely you would need multiple streams
[3:35:38] <GeltonZ> The heat is enraging the mind goblins
[3:35:42] <leinadtonu> maybe pat is just pregnant
[3:35:42] <%rickyjones47> play some mindless cod
[3:35:47] <ToneBacas> time to farm
[3:35:47] <%Dr00_PhD> So level up then turn it off
[3:35:49] <%Garthunox> reloae
[3:35:49] <%코코꾸라> You have to spend them first
[3:35:50] <%Lunaticbro > apply your levels then turn expert off
[3:35:50] <natertot1> no you have to manualy raise thme
[3:35:51] <+Dimfish> why would you test that lmao
[3:35:53] <OkamiDude15> it stays there for when you wanna actually use them
[3:35:55] <%redrins> turn on, level up and turn off? idk
[3:35:56] <%hotdough> level them up then turn it off
[3:35:56] <Plugman86> ZR use all EXP
[3:35:57] <SchroedingersFerret> Pat it was japes
[3:35:57] <Interestedsc00t> sweaty goblin brain cant do this right now
[3:35:58] <vinnnyaraujo> are you gonna try xenoblade again in a later date?
[3:35:58] <+alphonseisbest> MANUALLY LEVEL UR SELF THEN SWITCH IT OFF
[3:35:59] <damnvier> "can level up"
[3:36:01] <%Livelinne> BibleThump
[3:36:06] <WRFWD> Yes

[3:36:28] <BallerSwagBro9k> WOOLIE LIVE WITH DOOM
[3:36:33] <%MisterRockett> NO
[3:36:36] <$Dakuu75> this has been the MOST confusing stream in a while
[3:36:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> RIP AND TEAR
[3:36:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> So I am guessing the air conditioner still busted?
[3:36:42] <+Jaysky> Ha ha she's lvl 6
[3:36:49] <DetroitSentai> SP is from kills
[3:36:51] <lordzaskez> yes
[3:36:52] <%Lunaticbro > you got new arts
[3:36:54] <WRFWD> Every art with a red dot was new
[3:36:56] <%코코꾸라> SP is from kills, you got arts
[3:36:57] <%Starotter70> You learned some new arts
[3:37:10] <%walternatorz> Pat's core temperature is too high and it's affecting performance.
[3:37:12] <WRFWD> Yes
[3:37:13] <%Starotter70> Bless you
[3:37:15] <%heartlesshealer> skills are NOT exp-based
[3:37:15] <%코코꾸라> yes
[3:37:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> Woolie isn't live
[3:37:17] <%Bane_Kaikyo> what the heck is going on?
[3:37:18] <%nofestu2> bess
[3:37:20] <+alphonseisbest> seems like it
[3:37:20] <wrightlight94> Bless you Pat
[3:37:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> SP works like LP does in FF12
[3:37:35] <DXLelouch24> @doc_ock_rokc yea he is im staring at the streams
[3:37:36] <+Jake_Protagonist> like level 1 from kh
[3:37:41] <Bguy32> it's not that weird
[3:37:42] <natertot1> expert mode is basically just choose your own level adventure
[3:37:43] <+alphonseisbest> man what a aimless stream
[3:37:45] <dv9l> future pat is gonna be so confused when he comes back to level 1 shulk
[3:37:46] <duel_pro> you've been handicapping yourself for the whole stream
[3:37:55] <@SoFarFetched> so much HATE
[3:38:00] <+Jaysky> I HATE dat
[3:38:01] <%cvp5127> check options
[3:38:03] <Willfordbrimly> Still no cam?! Damnit, I want to see the sweaty goblin!
[3:38:07] <%toastybites> USE IT. USE YOUR HATE.
[3:38:08] <%heartlesshealer> gotta use system switch menu
[3:38:11] <%luftraumm1> he HATES it
[3:38:12] <%Meltdown547> Oh my god.
[3:38:17] <%emperordread> Like Uchiha Sasuke, you don't have enough ... hatred
[3:38:18] <%walternatorz> Just burn it
[3:38:19] <Bguy32> wait why is he starting over?
[3:38:23] <Noponiz> the heck is he losing it about?
[3:38:34] <$Dakuu75> Stay Hydrated
[3:38:34] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I have no clue
[3:38:34] <%heartlesshealer> he wants a fresh start when he plays it on his own time
[3:38:34] <Futurecity10> Todays not been a good day for pat
[3:38:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> pat needs to get his balls 7nstuck from his nips
[3:38:42] <%Ninestempest> i think he's just too hot cause his ac is fucked
[3:38:44] <DXLelouch24> Pat the MMO guy hates lots of systems, who knew
[3:38:45] <DetroitSentai> Slightly less than optimal on your first playthrough
[3:38:47] <%walternatorz> Pat has reached critical melting point.
[3:38:48] <%Livelinne> dechartHydrate dechartHydrate dechartHydrate dechartHydrate dechartHydrate
[3:38:49] <%Ninestempest> i would never stream if i was hot as fuck
[3:38:52] <vinnnyaraujo> is pat not going to play xenoblade on stream anymore?
[3:38:54] <+WaywardSera> I love Crazy Talk
[3:38:55] <%Shadicara> Think his brain is melting from the heat I feel to be fair
[3:38:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Well, I'm gonna go play some Cinders, y'all have a good night chat
[3:39:05] <CrypticMochi> Pat needs to batwing near a fan
[3:39:08] <%heartlesshealer> It was supposed to be a one-off today
[3:39:13] <FoolproofDread> night
[3:39:13] <DXLelouch24> @vinnnyaraujo nope go buy it
[3:39:14] <DXLelouch24> Now
[3:39:28] <DXLelouch24> Pats a big dumb goblin baby but the games amazing
[3:39:32] <OkamiDude15> octoGun go buy it
[3:39:47] <+egalitarian696969> please don't ever take pat's opinion consensus
[3:39:52] <%xeros720> next week pat hates the game, but still puts 30 hours into it
[3:39:54] <+egalitarian696969> as*
[3:40:02] <$Dakuu75> Pat is basically streaming with a Burn-debuff on at all times, thanks to no AC
[3:40:13] <%afronooch> better: form your own opinions
[3:40:24] <vinnnyaraujo> I played the original back in the day but so yeah...game is my favorite of all time...I gonna buy it on the switch when we are on bettet times because right now is tough
[3:40:31] <%Starotter70> @Dakuu75 But the Burn also does MP damage
[3:40:37] <DXLelouch24> as someone thats beaten Xenoblade Chronicles, you should buy the game
[3:40:41] <DXLelouch24> NOW
[3:40:41] <%b1gboss007> b1gboss007 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Take my prime
[3:40:52] <%walternatorz> Here's hoping his spritzing is able too cool himself down
[3:41:06] <Futurecity10> Games amazing, just pretend XB2 doesnt exist
[3:41:17] <%KnivesEve> game comes tuesday for me so ima play it alot when it comes
[3:41:21] <DetroitSentai> XBC2 is really good too tho
[3:41:29] <%Starotter70> I've personally found that rubbing water all over your naked body is quite therapeutic
[3:41:31] <%logoth_> XBC2 is trash
[3:41:51] <DXLelouch24> Angry welsh catgirl sounds*
[3:42:01] <Manmadeawesome> @detroitsentai combat system in 2 is better then 1 but that's all that's better imo
[3:42:01] <Futurecity10> XB2 sold out to otaku culture and ruined the entire stories themes
[3:42:07] <+egalitarian696969> XBC2 is a fine game with very stupid writing
[3:42:19] <+egalitarian696969> and designs
[3:42:22] <%logoth_> XBC2 isnt even a fine game, it still gives you tutorials 30 hours into the damn game
[3:42:22] <%cvp5127> this weeb game series is too weeb

[3:42:39] <%logoth_> The battle system is a confused mess of systems
[3:42:39] <DetroitSentai> The writing is pretty solid, optional characters dont "ruin" it
[3:42:39] <DXLelouch24> 2 did have playable Kosmos
[3:42:39] <%ringabal> The voice acting in 1 was so good, reality had to make 2 awful
[3:42:40] <CrypticMochi> I only cared about the late xbc2 stuff. I like Zeke, Morag and Nia though.

[3:44:19] <@SoFarFetched> You should like do warzone one week,runeterra another week to switch it off.

[3:44:49] <%BubbaRands> HAH LUL
[3:44:50] <+Promessa_EX> dio would fit very well
[3:44:55] <+Promessa_EX> but that's a stretch
[3:45:01] <sharpington_> !uptime
[3:45:02] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 45m.
[3:45:04] <+Promessa_EX> boon only cares about dc
[3:45:09] <DXLelouch24> PSO2 is unfucked btw Pat so if you wanna try it out there ya go
[3:45:12] <DXLelouch24> use Tweaker
[3:45:14] <%ZoltanBMagnus> I don't want to see a realistic DIO
[3:45:14] <Tidus0203> no AC? so your resting around shirtless in all your hairy glory?
[3:45:17] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Yis
[3:45:22] <$Draylle> it gave the series the stigma of having waifus
[3:45:24] <%redrins> it really didnt but ok
[3:45:27] <DetroitSentai> XBC2 is still super good
[3:45:30] <%Shadicara> Story of waifus
[3:45:30] <%maenos2> xenoblade 2 has welsh catgirl, therefore its good
[3:45:33] <%Valdorick> A story of Gacha
[3:45:33] <%MisterRockett> Oh Phat?
[3:45:34] <%velemi> at first yeah
[3:45:35] <tacomaster740> out of nowhere star ocean playthrough
[3:45:36] <%ringabal> For the money
[3:45:36] <DetroitSentai> No?
[3:45:37] <Futurecity10> THERE ANOTHER DONATION
[3:45:42] <+RestlessCorpse> Yeah, going on some random job, and then the weebness explodes all over you
[3:45:45] <%Shadicara> Fuck a sword dude god Kappa
[3:45:49] <Monkeyweed21> BUH KOS MOS THO
[3:45:50] <%ShawnTK_> the gacha is pretty bad
[3:45:51] <%goose_attack_almanac> Do Job. Do Gacha
[3:45:53] <%Sokumotanaka> Yeah X2 sucked man
[3:45:56] <+ATorL> Sounds like someone who didn't actually finish XB2
[3:46:00] <%ringabal> And then Tetsuya Nomura's OCs show up
[3:46:01] <%goose_attack_almanac> Enjoy fat tatas and flat bums
[3:46:03] <%GohanHitsugaya> I think the only thing I like about Xenoblade 2, is how cute the main character is.
[3:46:06] <%Valdorick> Yes
[3:46:08] <faldin> but you missed out on the broken back fat titty furry lady
[3:46:08] <$Draylle> true
[3:46:09] <CrypticMochi> I wish xbc2 had the full team
[3:46:10] <DetroitSentai> The gacha has problems, but you get systems that build into in really good ways
[3:46:15] <%BubbaRands> I like story of F A T
[3:46:21] <+Pokenomicon> I love Xeno 2 tho
[3:46:24] <%velemi> it does
[3:46:26] <%bevyrage> it gets worse even
[3:46:26] <%scibren> I mean that's not what the story is about but ok
[3:46:26] <$Draylle> the antagonist literally says "nothing personal"
[3:46:27] <%MisterRockett> Mythra is good.
[3:46:28] <Decarcassor> All I remember about Xenoblade 1 is that I immedialty hated it and never played beyond the first hour. :p
[3:46:29] <Monkeyweed21> there is a full on harem shit
[3:46:30] <%redrins> piss end was X not 2, they are still both great games
[3:46:31] <+Promessa_EX> would like to fuck pyra's fat tits do
[3:46:32] <%Sokumotanaka> @PatStaresAt Would you be interested in playing stick of truth and it's sequel?
[3:46:32] <Bluewind098> that's really not being fair to XC2
[3:46:32] <%maenos2> Welsh catgirl!
[3:46:32] <Manmadeawesome> it does though
[3:46:33] <Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt He literally gets both girls at the end for no reason
[3:46:34] <%MisterRockett> And can replace Pyra in the party.
[3:46:36] <%Starotter70> A little, but not enough
[3:46:36] <%Shadicara> Xeno 2 is fine, the problem is going up from Xenoblade
[3:46:39] <+Irridium> so just gonna ignore everyone fighting desperately not do die because they don't want to lose who they are huh
[3:46:42] <%heartlesshealer> I didn't want to remember the damn harem
[3:46:44] <+ATorL> XB2 does get better. The game is entirely different by the end.
[3:46:46] <%BubbaRands> NUUUU BibleThump Skemoooo!
[3:46:47] <madskull456> BibleThump
[3:46:49] <%cvp5127> this weeb game is too weeb
[3:46:50] <%Shadicara> LUL
[3:46:53] <GeltonZ> Xenoblade 2 is the only game I like in the series due to the superior combat.
[3:46:53] <FoolproofDread> Dedicated Elmo cam when
[3:46:54] <%heartlesshealer> what
[3:47:03] <tacomaster740> wat
[3:47:05] <Futurecity10> 6 was good though?
[3:47:08] <%riderstrike152> Kiwami 2 is Dope
[3:47:11] <+SinisterBroccoli> People like watching bad games tho
[3:47:20] <OkamiDude15> MARK 2 PAT
[3:47:22] <DetroitSentai> It's okay
[3:47:22] <%Nobrev> MARK TWO
[3:47:24] <Monkeyweed21> Did you hear about Xenogears 2? @PatStaresAt
[3:47:26] <%heartlesshealer> don't stream the ending ; D
[3:47:32] <biggercow789> Xenoblade 2 has better combat than 1 but not until 50 hours in.
[3:47:35] <%redrins> ending was fine, yamato mk 3 wasnt tho lmao
[3:47:52] <DetroitSentai> XBC2 has great combat far earlier than 50 hours
[3:48:00] <%ShawnTK_> no it doesn't
[3:48:09] <Monkeyweed21> the Yamato MK2 is a raid boss in PSO2 @PatStaresAt
[3:48:11] <faldin> too bad xenoblade 2 has damage sponge enemies
[3:48:13] <@SoFarFetched> hoo boy
[3:48:15] <%cvp5127> thermal paste
[3:48:16] <+Promessa_EX> you almost can't screw up
[3:48:16] <%toastybites> Just watch that Verge video lmao
[3:48:18] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> make sure to put thermal paste on your cpu
[3:48:19] <%Starotter70> Oh?
[3:48:21] <%MisterRockett> @DetroitSentai I'm 40 hours in and still haven't done a single complete break, topple, launch, smash combo.
[3:48:21] <buerdo> Did pat beat the game?
[3:48:32] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah maintaining arcade cabinets suck
[3:48:35] <OkamiDude15> remember when pat was crying at kiryu's letter until it was revealed to actually be for daigo instead of haruka
[3:48:44] <@SoFarFetched> cause you gotta scrounge for parts.
[3:48:47] <@SoFarFetched> or make them yourself
[3:49:06] <j0ustar> Here's a horror story: Driver issues
[3:49:14] <%Shadicara> Fuck that who takes the whole thing out Kappa
[3:49:22] <%SWFanatic> Elmo become HUGE
[3:49:33] <%HRDSalami654> Thermal paste is fine, especially if you are using non-conductive paste.
[3:49:33] <%BubbaRands> nononono
[3:49:35] <FoolproofDread> Oh.
[3:49:38] <@SoFarFetched> it can shoot the tiniest hole into your finger and it will hurt like a BITCH
[3:49:39] <%GohanHitsugaya> ...Okay then
[3:49:39] <%Nupinoop296> what
[3:49:41] <%Starotter70> huh
[3:49:42] <%Nickmobox> Oh Fuck
[3:49:43] <%filialpails> you say "the" capacitor, but motherboards are covered in them
[3:49:43] <+RestlessCorpse> Tron wasn't a true story, dude
[3:49:48] <%redrins> wasnt that part of the monitor_
[3:49:50] <%Sokumotanaka> WHAT!?
[3:49:51] <%filialpails> YES THERE IS
[3:49:52] <%Shadicara> Yeah PC won't give me death if I touch it wrong
[3:49:53] <%afronooch> KillSwith: Engage
[3:49:54] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Power Supply can do that
[3:49:55] <+Promessa_EX> do not open tour psu
[3:49:56] <j0ustar> Capacitor make YOU go brrrrr
[3:49:56] <n37h3r> CAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTSSSSSSS
[3:49:59] <%BubbaRands> WOOOT :D
[3:50:00] <%velemi> THERE IS THOUGH
[3:50:00] <%Nordguy> wear rubber gloves then, hoøy shit
[3:50:01] <%bevyrage> power supply pat
[3:50:02] <leinadtonu> So lick that part, you say
[3:50:02] <ExpressNode> Just ground yourself and turn off and unplug the PSU
[3:50:05] <%HRDSalami654> The only way you can really screw up thermal paste is getting it in the CPU pin contacts.
[3:50:23] <Monkeyweed21> a PSU doesnt hold enough voltage to kill too
[3:50:23] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> always make sure to ground yourself when messing around with your comp
[3:50:23] <jfp4life> I wanted you to get to Metal Face today... oh well hopefully you get further into to game this time around
[3:50:25] <%aishman> Oh did the stream just end?
[3:50:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> True, you literally have to break open the PSU to kill yourself
[3:50:27] <@SoFarFetched> All this arcade talk,as Im looking at my arcade machine behind me.
[3:50:28] <%bevyrage> you do realize that power supplies at random get plugged in for testing right?
[3:50:30] <%blastazoid26> Oh its over?
