[0:10:52] <+WutangchickeN> YAY BEARD RETURN
[0:10:52] <%SovPho> being an eagle scout is a very fast way of informing people you're a libertarian
[0:11:08] <liquorclerk> Don’t eat cat poop
[0:11:10] <%shurtal> cat shit, it's the shit
[0:11:11] <+WutangchickeN> Let's not get chat or PPP started on knotting...
[0:11:11] <teefpal> "My stomach biome hungers for feces, Father"
[0:11:12] <%ChrisPlaysThing> He needs the protein snacks Kappa
[0:11:15] <%MechArch> its his right to eat the poop
[0:11:18] <IvanMistwalker> why do dogs eat it?
[0:11:21] <%RealThiele> protein bars

[0:11:32] <DianaTheAscian> has he successfully eaten shit?
[0:11:33] <%king_wragles> Dogs are driven to protein, and cat shit is apparently high in protein so..

[0:11:55] <%WeLucklessJacks> My troop was nearly all Republicans. I heard so much racist shit from the other kids talking to each other.
[0:11:55] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Gief is organizing a Freedom Rally at the fridge for his right to eat poop.
[0:11:59] <%Agami23> poison?
[0:12:01] <%spitelite> naw only the eagle scouts that bring up they are an eagle scout every 5 mins are libertarians
[0:12:05] <%SovPho> i firmly believe most libertarians would survive the apocalypse which is why humanity will fail
[0:12:05] <%Saadi90> Mustard
[0:12:09] <liquorclerk> Could be a diet thing if he is always trying to eat poop

[0:55:57] <+NohbdyIsCrash> Well yeah, there is literally no other place to put words in these games.
[0:55:58] <%Buttlo> I thought in an interview he only did the worldbuilding part of the story.
[0:56:01] <%Sotetsu> Pat is really good at teaching the dog tricks.
[0:56:01] <%Frost_Quill> Did GRRM know he wasn't writing the story of the main character of the game (probably)?
[0:56:01] <DXLelouch24> Winds of Winter delayed due to soul damage
[0:56:01] <@Spydurman> does GRRM even exist? Is there proof? Kappa
[0:56:04] <%SirGO0SE> I started to try to teach mine to speen because of gief LUL

[0:56:26] <%SirGO0SE> THATS HOW YOU DO IT
[0:56:37] <%ospreyworks> you should get him a shuffle mat to distract him with doggy brain teasers

[0:56:54] <+shabop> how can he slap?
[0:57:06] <+victhebeard> soooo.... Pat did hit her but in a fun way LUL
[0:57:12] <zerointelligence000> I wonder if grrm even knows the From Soft art style and whether the ideas for his characters even look similar to what we're getting
[0:57:14] <%SirGO0SE> that would be amazing
[0:57:23] <%cade_calrayn> that dog will be come a weapon of ass destruction

[1:00:32] <%cade_calrayn> the only red skeletons she's into are Pat's skeleton and Papyrus
[1:00:34] <@Spydurman> since when has Paige been picky about skeletons LUL
[1:00:35] <%Jamejarrs> It's definitely sink-or-swim with its worldbuilding, but once you're in it's great.
[1:00:36] <%Schrodingers_Box> Dont like Red Skeletons? wow thats Racist

[1:01:27] <+TheBitingIrish> Logs in the bowl build
[1:01:27] <%SovPho> @PatStaresAt Have you played POE before?  You should probably look up a build. Some parts of the game just... wall you if you don't follow a decent build.

[1:14:36] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt A woman couldn't sleep at night cause she heard a scrapping noise coming from downstairs. She called her dog and stuck her hand out from under the covers. Her dog licked her hand. She repeated this several times throught the night. In the morning she found her dog dead downstairs, who was licking her hand?
[1:14:37] <vandastelka> so is this jump scare or atmospheric horror.
[1:14:42] <+trackles_64> weapon?

[1:35:52] <ExpressNode> This is what a regular animal clinic looks like
[1:35:54] <@QueequegTheater> That's not what non-Euclidean means

[1:36:35] <+Hellarussian> dog get
[1:36:36] <NRhyme> potadog
[1:36:37] <thesugardaddy111> no it isn't
[1:36:39] <%Agami23> non-euclidian just means not flat
[1:36:40] <+PopotoGaius> Has Dog
[1:36:41] <kingra> Save dog :D
[1:36:42] <%twistedj3ster> DEPLOY THE DOG
[1:36:43] <Pookiedaexzile> It doesn't have a head
[1:36:44] <+capybruhArt> is this the origin of dog
[1:36:49] <NRhyme> it's that weird dog pillow
[1:36:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Dog no havey head
[1:36:50] <ExpressNode> Dogbrator
[1:36:54] <+waverunner56> Seeing the dog like that makes me so sad
[1:36:57] <%MyNameIsRasus> non euclidean means not on a plane
[1:36:58] <+HexForest> go back down the bolt cutter hall
[1:37:08] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Non-Euclidean is just any geometry that isn't on a flat surface, the whole world is non-Euclidean
[1:37:09] <ricoashy> sogEmotion

[1:37:19] <+vexion_smh> WTF
[1:37:23] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Agami23 And fun fact, a lot of our architecture is non-euclidian.
[1:37:24] <+HexForest> Blue room is save I think
[1:37:29] <stukamod> That mixtape sucked
[1:37:31] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Deep fried
[1:37:37] <dwhanson> The issue is that Lovecraft just that it would be cool to say Non-euclidian. It doesn't mean anything. Except now it means weird geometry
[1:37:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> "This... is a Super Canine"
[1:37:39] <NRhyme> ur moms non-euclidian
[1:37:39] <+Eightesu> is the John Wick if it was a horror film?
[1:37:43] <BarnYardFiddler> psaDabb
[1:37:43] <+NobuuNobuu> what's this game about?
[1:37:44] <+PopotoGaius> Was that a fail state? or...
[1:37:45] <%CatastropheCorvid> @QueequegTheater Thank you. Common misconception, that.
[1:37:46] <%SovPho> non-Euclidean doesn't mean nonflat it just means it doesn't follow the same coordinate system as a Euclidean plane.

[1:38:08] <+YabbaTroll> @NobuuNobuu Your falls in a sewer and you gotta get him
[1:38:11] <@SoFarFetched> OMICRON
[1:38:14] <@QueequegTheater> Lovecraft had the excuse of being a literal high school dropout
[1:38:17] <+waverunner56> If only you could smuggle the bolt cutters from the tap
[1:38:17] <@SoFarFetched> "DOORS LOCKED"
[1:38:18] <+rdark_ksu> An escalator can't break tho. It just becomes stairs

[1:38:29] <Essixian> @SoFarFetched DO NOT SPEAK THAT NAME
[1:38:30] <brovietto> SHIT GETS RUSTY: All Locks Are Broken
[1:38:30] <+imthewisejanitor> WELCOME. IN. OMICRON.
[1:38:32] <%Phantomjay> his lp is so good
[1:38:33] <%Toynota10> has Pat shit his pants yet
[1:38:36] <+StooEsq> Bible.
[1:38:42] <+waverunner56> Lost in Koopie
[1:38:47] <%Agami23> @Essixian hp lovecraft didnt understand what non-euclidian meant and used it alot to mean impossible spaces and shapes. it literally just means not-flat
[1:38:47] <+HexForest> When that first enemy appeared he screamed
[1:38:49] <robosqueeb> caving in to barking encourages barking
[1:38:49] <Pookiedaexzile> @Toynota10 Yes but not to the game
[1:38:50] <%IamGrapes> da bibble
[1:38:51] <+Marzby> Wheres meepo
[1:38:52] <%CatastropheCorvid> Yet
[1:38:52] <GeneralHysterics> what about that other day
[1:38:52] <@Ranryu692> that implies you previously have
[1:38:54] <superchunk121> Always look up when u go in the save rooms
[1:38:55] <+Mrbaconator> so yesterday then
[1:38:56] <%twistedj3ster> but soon!
[1:38:58] <%MyNameIsRasus> There are bridges and shit irl that are non euclidean
[1:38:59] <derekpwns> nipple
[1:39:00] <scholar9541> not yet he means
[1:39:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> One day closer Pat
[1:39:03] <%bevyrage> immersion~
[1:39:08] <BarnYardFiddler> Nice
[1:39:13] <Essixian> @Agami23 I know, I was making a joke :P
[1:39:18] <%twistedj3ster> yeah, you can't win
[1:39:21] <Dopamien> being a dog encourages barking
[1:39:22] <%Agami23> ohhh
[1:39:24] <%SovPho> You can set your coordinates in an axiomatic space where "flat" has divergent definition of numeric algebra that Euclidean space is based in. That's what non-Euclidean space is. You can walk across a flat plane that is circular but reach a different point than where you started after a full rotation.
[1:39:25] <%AoiRob> this place is scummy
[1:39:30] <AzureSkyKnight> Dont give in Paige
[1:39:31] <GeneralHysterics> HIT THE LEVER
[1:39:36] <+waverunner56> I'm just remembering when Zangief lost his shit at the "Uh oh, stinky" monkey on the podcast
[1:39:37] <+HexForest> It's a great map
[1:39:40] <NRhyme> can't trust a donut with hard angles
[1:39:45] <ExpressNode> So what the fuck is this game?
[1:39:46] <scrumbotime> Real Ass Map
[1:39:46] <%Agami23> at least it shows where you are
[1:39:46] <$Jaxnos> so in other words, non-euclidean got dumbed into meaning something else over a century so everyone is right
[1:39:47] <scholar9541> feed the kraken
[1:39:48] <%Niney_Who> Look at those COLORED ZONES
[1:39:49] <GeneralHysterics> look at this silent hill ass map
[1:39:49] <%Broand> The royale phantome
[1:39:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Gief only knows how to say one word
[1:39:50] <%Beough> that is certainly a map
[1:39:50] <Orenjevel> thats a map alright
[1:39:59] <BarnYardFiddler> @sovpho doodDerp
[1:39:59] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Is that a box of donuts on the table?
[1:40:06] <@Lion_kun> Pat, if you ever shit yourself on stream, would you be a gentleman and admit it or would you deny it to your grave?
[1:40:26] <%SovPho> @BarnYardFiddler fair
[1:40:28] <+Eightesu> nah deny it
[1:40:33] <subjectg> @sovpho that lines up with my understanding that it’s geometry that doesn’t quite follow “conventional” rules of geometry
[1:40:33] <studleydoorite> we could smell it from here
[1:40:36] <%MyNameIsRasus> pat would take the arin hanson approach
[1:40:36] <+waverunner56> Pat would make history
[1:40:40] <ExpressNode> Just waddle off screen with your britches full of shit
[1:40:43] <person181> the universe would stop for a second and pat starts to tear up
[1:40:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> *retching in the distance*
[1:40:44] <Laecerelius> See it on pat's pants shitting face
[1:40:46] <Dopamien> so whenever pat cries it was because he shit himself
[1:40:47] <quantras6> Every day you don't shit your pants, you come closer to the day you inevitably do.
[1:40:47] <ToastyBroDude> like that time you sat on the chocolate and started crying
[1:40:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WEVE WAITED SO LONG woolieMIRIN LUL Kappa psaDabb

[1:40:52] <%SovPho> @subjectg that's the correct understanding
[1:40:53] <stukamod> Deny it first, talk about it later during podcast
[1:40:54] <Drunkengen> I think gief wants to be found lol
[1:40:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Zangief Demands his time on the stream
[1:40:56] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  as someone who has shat himself in public, it's not that bad.
[1:41:00] <Ombrebird> LET HIM BSRK
[1:41:00] <+HexForest> HAMMER
[1:41:00] <NRhyme> paige wouldn't take pictures?
[1:41:00] <+Eightesu> Pat always deny no matter what and full on gaslight everyone
[1:41:03] <+Grayhammatter> wow, that is indeed a mpa
[1:41:06] <+waverunner56> Isn't that the only reason everyone is here?
[1:41:06] <%AoiRob> there was a room here. it's gone now

[1:41:18] <nastybagl> pat on a survival horror game? im shocked
[1:41:24] <scholar9541> well at least he's using the sledgehammer for its purpose
[1:41:26] <+vexion_smh> Zangief knows monkaS
[1:41:29] <teefpal> @Chatterbox1991 sometimes there are things that shouldnt be said in chat
[1:41:37] <NRhyme> hammer isn't strong enough. shoot door into existance
[1:41:42] <+DragonEsscence> @PatStaresAt as someone who has shat himself in public, it is indeed that bad
[1:41:44] <+clevernamewhere> is that hammer honking?
[1:41:49] <%MyNameIsRasus> since this game has combat it's a survival horror right
[1:42:09] <+waverunner56> I never shat myself, but I have thrown up outside the Vatican
[1:42:10] <DXLelouch24> thats a silent hill map
[1:42:13] <quantras6> you know, I'm something of a pants shitter myself
[1:42:14] <%bevyrage> combat in a horror game doesn't make it survival, it's managing your resources that makes it survival
[1:42:17] <+HexForest> There's ammo, which means inventory management kinda exists
[1:42:19] <ricoashy> 3
[1:42:22] <scholar9541> @nrhyme  I agree
[1:42:30] <sirrice77> @waverunner56 that was just the demons leaving your body

[2:01:03] <The_Quiet_Corner> i think the shotgun actually does less damage than the damaged .22
[2:01:03] <+tempestzephyr> is it a sex horse cult?
[2:01:04] <Manwad> horsegame sounds so cool
[2:01:06] <%Brassnarwhal> good save
[2:01:14] <%valriot> Oh ok sorry that was nothing LUL
[2:01:17] <%Dakuu75> good examine
[2:01:20] <%Felhad> We don't worship the horse in the picture, we worship the picture of the horse.
[2:01:20] <%twistedj3ster> Aw man, you got salmon? I want salmon
[2:01:20] <+Beetlewins> Pat stream Secrets of the Magic Crystal
[2:01:23] <VirtuaRailith> feed him the salmon
[2:01:29] <+HexForest> you haven't hit the switch
[2:01:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> @tempestzephyr every cult is a sex cult.
[2:01:34] <NRhyme> is the player character too young to know what a vhs is?
[2:01:35] <Adam_ET> Oh that horse cult, always horsing around
[2:01:40] <scholar9541> We need Elmo!!
[2:01:40] <+waverunner56> The horses are just waking up
[2:01:46] <deviljhojho_> I pronounced the L in salmon for over 25 years of my lfie
[2:01:47] <teefpal> there been two enemy encounters this whole game
[2:01:49] <Mark3MSK> What’s the FOV on this thing
[2:01:52] <SocialMisfitGamer> you noticed the music is just stright up gone
[2:01:54] <%Brassnarwhal> @nrhyme what's a vhs
[2:01:56] <+yuribo26> Shit's locked
[2:01:57] <SocialMisfitGamer> something is coming
[2:02:05] <+HexForest> There is an FOV option I think, but the default is super low on purpose
[2:02:07] <deviljhojho_> somethin scary
[2:02:08] <+waverunner56> @teefpal And they made a huge impact
[2:02:09] <%sdewts> @deviljhojho_ oh my god
[2:02:12] <+Grayhammatter> shit's broken
[2:02:23] <NRhyme> @deviljhojho_ if you weren't supposed to pronounce the l the l wouldn't be there.
[2:02:26] <+JordantheKitty> is the map wrong or is your brain wrong
[2:02:28] <deviljhojho_> @sdewts dont tell anyone how i live
[2:02:30] <Orenjevel> mysterious
[2:02:30] <scholar9541> who broke it damn it
[2:02:34] <+yuribo26> The map is gaslighting you
[2:02:36] <GeneralHysterics> how rude would it be to give players flat out wrong information
[2:02:38] <%vehementvadr> snarling gief
[2:02:39] <deviljhojho_> @NRhyme now this is a good take
[2:02:40] <+HexForest> map's out of date and the place is all fucked up and spooky
[2:02:41] <%AoiRob> its an old map ig

[2:02:46] <%sdewts> @deviljhojho_ i got you bro
[2:02:49] <Mark3MSK> Wtf is that growl
[2:02:52] <+waverunner56> It's Horse Gas
[2:02:54] <Profmcstevie> Then MAKE a path pattyBrain
[2:02:54] <@QueequegTheater> Maybe the room heard your girl screams and left
[2:02:55] <bobdoletrasher> @PatStaresAt hint at a secret maybe?
[2:03:00] <VirtuaRailith> mystrious zangeif horror audio
[2:03:00] <scholar9541> I guess we got a mapping issue
[2:03:15] <Mark3MSK> oh that growl was not ingame lol
[2:03:20] <+HexForest> go pick that lock
[2:03:29] <%sdewts> I just ate a bowl of chili and I'm still hungry. Should I make a sandwich y/n
[2:03:29] <%Brassnarwhal> geif knows the horse is coming
[2:03:30] <%AoiRob> this is just 'Gaslighting: The Game'
[2:03:39] <Adam_ET> "Door broke" "Understandable, have a nice day"
[2:03:42] <%Brassnarwhal> make the sandwich
[2:03:43] <NRhyme> @Brassnarwhal 90% of redlettermedia's content
[2:03:51] <scholar9541> @mark3msk  don't worry I thought the barjs he was making earlier were in-game
[2:03:55] <+Freakin_Wolfy> is this the game with the lost dog?
[2:04:04] <scholar9541> barks

[2:04:19] <+KodoqueG> Your handgun is a Ruger Mk I
[2:04:19] <Orenjevel> I love a good ammo room
[2:04:20] <+CallMeThreeGunsGreg> The pistol in this game is a Ruger 10.22
[2:04:20] <%CalderGaming> Ruger is a real arms manufacturer
[2:04:20] <$Emperor_Machinus> @Freakin_Wolfy yus
[2:04:20] <Visorak6> ruger is a brand
[2:04:21] <subjectg> ruger is a real brand

[2:04:45] <+Beetlewins> shotgun/sledge on the broken doors maybe
[2:04:48] <+rdark_ksu> Ruger was nearly my name, was my dads idea
[2:04:49] <+Freakin_Wolfy> @Emperor_Machinus did it get a visual upgrade? I remember it being much lower quality
[2:04:49] <%CatastropheCorvid> Your gun looks like  a Ruger Standard pistol.
[2:04:52] <+CallMeThreeGunsGreg> Oh whoops that's the 22 rifle isn't it. Yeah, it's a Mk 1
[2:04:55] <@QueequegTheater> Pat doesn't know the difference between a BAR and a full auto Garand
[2:04:56] <+waverunner56> The Horse is strong, it cannot go down
[2:04:57] <subjectg> the sniper rifle in l4d, for example, is also a ruger
[2:04:58] <BigWhiteBro> that looks like a ruger mkIV

[2:05:20] <%CatastropheCorvid> @CallMeThreeGunsGreg Could be a standard or a MKIV
[2:05:21] <$Emperor_Machinus> @HexForest wrong, he is dating an american. Guns have been thrust into his life
[2:05:23] <+Mowsferatu> monkass
[2:05:28] <%SovPho> It's probably like 4 different guns used for references
[2:05:29] <%oda_flobunaga> What's worse Ruger or Hrothgar?
[2:05:30] <%twistedj3ster> there was something about it cyclying or feeding that was interesting but I don't remember what it was
[2:05:31] <subjectg> Trent pls stop

[2:05:53] <scholar9541> shotgun has failed?! Abandon all hope
[2:05:59] <%Bluwizard21> Wow that worked?
[2:06:03] <GeneralHysterics> god bless the shotgun
[2:06:06] <Fien111> @king_wragles Man all the noise assets in this game are Silent Hill as FUCK
[2:06:08] <%CatastropheCorvid> This is the LockPicking Lawyer...
[2:06:16] <Mark3MSK> Turns power off, ALL NOOSY GENERATORS COME ON
[2:06:21] <NRhyme> oh shit, got caught up in the stream and forgot i made food
[2:06:22] <subjectg> Little click out of one…
[2:06:22] <Fien111> also why did that reply to that person, sorry
[2:06:23] <%Brassnarwhal> why do the ghosts have soup pots on their feet?
[2:06:24] <NRhyme> food cold
[2:06:24] <%MyNameIsRasus> weren't you after your dog at some point
[2:06:35] <%king_wragles> This conversion kit is fucking foul. Whoever made this should be imprisoned forever, how dare you to that to the M1!
[2:06:37] <Parapattern> *Shoots you for being a pest*
[2:06:40] <+HexForest> Theoretically the dog is still down here
[2:06:47] <Orenjevel> 1 hit KO, ez
[2:06:50] <Daxalog> freaking tagged em AND bagged em
[2:06:51] <+yoshkosh20> gotta survive to find the god.
[2:06:53] <+yoshkosh20> dog
[2:06:59] <%twistedj3ster> dropped it like a sack of potatoes
[2:07:15] <+yoshkosh20> zangief loves monster murder.
[2:07:22] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Scary game aren't scary the moment you can kill them easily. Which is why F.E.A.R. is the scariest shit I played first time through.
[2:07:44] <%Brassnarwhal> geif hates subway tunnels
[2:07:45] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> I almost thought the whistling from the game was making Gief bark, but prolly not
[2:07:49] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Tell her to just say "treats" like an adult
[2:07:53] <%JonathLP> Greenies?
[2:07:57] <NRhyme> that sound effect...
[2:08:01] <NRhyme> turok?
[2:08:12] <+Mowsferatu> @CatastropheCorvid what I have for you today is a horror game door lock. While most video game door locks seem impossible to unlock with the video game code, a simple lockpicking set will do the trick. Others have found ways to clip through the time, bypassing the security.
[2:08:16] <%Agami23> yeah greenies is a type of dog treat. good for the teeth
[2:08:16] <%MyNameIsRasus> greenies sounds like a weed euphemism
[2:08:19] <%Brassnarwhal> or public domain
[2:08:22] <+waverunner56> @Bluwizard21 I'd disagree. Headcrabs and the Flood are easy to kill, but still horrifying.
[2:08:35] <%Felhad> From the way these psychic zombos turn into burlap sacks when you shoot them I assume the end is going to be shooting some hell beast that turns out to be the corgo

[2:22:29] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I'm an Empath and I sense that Ya'll are being very rude to empaths
[2:22:34] <%MyNameIsRasus> me an empath knowing my mom is mad after she saw me poop in the poop drawer
[2:22:35] <%StebTheVee> Isn't everyone an empath?

[2:22:56] <+Beetlewins> half a box of wine
[2:22:57] <+HexForest> As an empath I'm sensing that Paige isn't an empath
[2:22:57] <deviljhojho_> i'm a MENpath

[2:23:19] <Daxalog> what does it mean when someone says there a "storyteller"?
[2:23:19] <%SovPho> one would say all people are not empaths
[2:23:19] <%Chichen> as an empath, I can tell you want to buy these NFTs
[2:23:21] <%FluorescentLB> im an empath, i think you don't like empaths
