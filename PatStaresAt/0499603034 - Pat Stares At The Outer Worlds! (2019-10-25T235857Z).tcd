[0:04:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> Game is fucking DOPE and I can say that cause I'm 36 and was a teen when Dope was acool thing to say.
[0:04:13] <Teyaric> You can straight up Megaton the Spacer's Choice town, by ending their power plant access
[0:04:16] <devanmuse> I've been saying for years that eventual space travel/colonization will be a corporcratic hellscape seeing humans living on the "Space Station Amazon" and I feel like this game agrees with me on that
[0:04:19] <1matheuw> it begins
[0:04:25] <redrins> @torontototoro no downsides, charisma and int iirc

[0:09:26] <$Chatterbox1991> RIPCheer500 More reports from my recent games of Hearts of Iron 4; after many tries i have successfully completed my campaign of annexing the United States as Canada, splitting the states between Canada and Mexico. Fun Feature; UK has the ability to annex Amerrica and form the Dominion of North America by unifying the former US under Canada, complete with a flag featuring an Eagle and Maple leaf; think i might do a game where i do that nd than decolonize to give Canada it's independence too

[0:14:42] <coracor> LUL
[0:14:43] <%RubberFistFight> @zombie_goasts alright so I looked into it - testosterone has nothing to do with it (at least in the way people think). It's actually how sensitive your hair follicles are to dihydrotestosterone. It's entirely genetics, and if your follicles are super-sensitive, then you can go bald even with low T.
[0:14:43] <gazingeye1> HA!
[0:14:47] <Gruhunchously> SEXUAL FRUSTRATION

[0:29:12] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Wait, are you playing this on controller? Gross
[0:29:15] <%ShineTheDiamond> Pat, you called this game the Outer Wilds yesterday, it's not surprising you missed the correct name for a type of cheese.

[0:29:33] <+BubbaRands> Domesticated space roach rats
[0:29:36] <%MonsieurHedge> so has this game been a ridiculously muggy mess that i have to wait for, or can i just buy this
[0:29:39] <+thefakeh> bethesda didnt write it?
[0:29:42] <%walternatorz> You just stole from them, of course they'd react like that.
[0:29:43] <%MonsieurHedge> buggy*
[0:29:44] <TheTunnelSn8ke> It's buttery smooth and captures space dieselpunk very nicely?
[0:29:45] <%Kataguro> B L I N D
[0:29:46] <%dekkitout> The high pedigree of detail?
[0:29:50] <0rond> not being a bethesda game is a big plus for most video games
[0:29:55] <%GarbageNirvana> @monsieurhedge Surprisingly stable for the most part
[0:29:59] <flyingavocad0s> They never attacked me here
[0:29:59] <CrabSlacks> not being on bethesda's engine means no jank scampering up mountain sides
[0:30:00] <TDAWS_MP132> not gonna inspect the moniter?
[0:30:04] <Tomkins2244> "Pretend"
[0:30:06] <%ShineTheDiamond> @MonsieurHedge Oh god no. It's very polished. for a new release
[0:30:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This game is AMAZING on launch. I've encountered 2 minor bugs in 6 hours
[0:30:09] <%cvp5127> oops it broke
[0:30:09] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[0:30:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> Lets not
[0:30:18] <0rond> and it will make broken physics noises
[0:30:22] <0rond> and won't do anything
[0:30:24] <%Kataguro> You can get garbage here too
[0:30:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hi there
[0:30:32] <%MonsieurHedge> fuck now i CAN'T justify not buying this
[0:30:35] <+BubbaRands> Soooo much cheese wheels
[0:30:35] <%MonsieurHedge> that aint good
[0:30:48] <%brave_sj> But I like being a trash goblin
[0:30:49] <%umbypokochan> but i need my caltrops!
[0:30:51] <TheTunnelSn8ke> So there isn't an excess of junk pickups.
[0:30:53] <%Teintstein> yes
[0:30:55] <%honeyman18> Playing this alongside stream with a pot of half caff
[0:30:57] <%Teintstein> give me toilet paper
[0:31:02] <%Razputin217> Shepard
[0:31:03] <+Diamond_Dynamo> There's some junk, but there's also literally a sell junk button
[0:31:03] <%Kataguro> I remember using ED-E instead for like the whole game
[0:31:04] <%Teintstein> fill my inventory with garbage
[0:31:08] <WarchiefGoldva> In F4 they tried to make garbage worthwhile to pick up.
[0:31:09] <%ShineTheDiamond> @honeyman18 Living the dream!
[0:31:10] <+chaumiester> So... more quality of life enhancements are awesome
[0:31:17] <Tomkins2244> I do remember that, combine Boone with Rex for ammunition and enemy vision OP
[0:31:20] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> So we cant put bins on peoples heads now?
[0:31:21] <CrabSlacks> Your only supposed to pick things up that have a 5 to 1 worth to weight ratio
[0:31:23] <Sokumotanaka> it's for the crafting system you nerd, shot glasses are super useful if you don't suck at crafting XD
[0:31:24] <+yasahiro1011> What IS the BEST anyway?
[0:31:33] <Bailey__gaming> It's not the best choice! it's spacer's choice!
[0:31:34] <+yasahiro1011> in this world
[0:31:45] <%SilvaChariot0133> 🤔
[0:31:49] <%Kataguro> This shit is fucked
[0:31:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> I thought the junk pickups were neat when I started playing Skyrim, but the novelty wore thin pretty fast.
[0:31:59] <%dekkitout> LUL
[0:32:01] <WarchiefGoldva> Fuck off, Doritos.
[0:32:04] <$Mothman742> @yasahiro1011 joe is

[0:33:14] <%SilvaChariot0133> hey wait a minute
[0:33:18] <$Mothman742> @yasahiro1011 nah ligma
[0:33:24] <%Teintstein> yo that's based on a real war poster
[0:33:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @rjshnozz I'm about 6 hours in. It's great fun and doesn't feel repetitive
[0:33:27] <%dekkitout> Aint that a WW1 propaganda poster?
[0:33:27] <+Diamond_Dynamo> So, why are you on controller?
[0:33:28] <Tomkins2244> I really want to see a Fallout game created by Quantic Dream, directed by David Cage and has Danny Devito as the main protagonist, fighting against twin brothers Steve Buscemi and Jeff Goldbloom.
[0:33:28] <%Teintstein> with a gorilla
[0:33:38] <%SilvaChariot0133> That's just the gorilla one yeah
[0:33:40] <+AllenDeadman> what have I missed?
[0:33:42] <+yasahiro1011> @Mothman742 oh ye ur right
[0:33:43] <SolverCODO> So it's nuka cola
[0:33:45] <+Fynale> i love how much crap is just rundown or abandoned so you can have that fallout feel to it
[0:33:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @tomkins2244 INSTANT GOTY
[0:33:52] <+rjshnozz> @BallerSwagBro9k thanks for your insight, homie
[0:33:54] <%Run44forrest> did pat burn it down yet
[0:33:54] <0rond> see you can tell he is a philolosophist because his hat says philolosophist on it
[0:34:02] <%Teintstein> @AllenDeadman were you here for pat making his hair just the worst?
[0:34:05] <%Kataguro> EAT BOLT GUN
[0:34:06] <CrabSlacks> I liked the hacking minigame
[0:34:06] <%3Xgilly> Has anyone heard when this game comes out on Switch?
[0:34:07] <WarchiefGoldva> The minigames were shite anyways.
[0:34:08] <+D00msDayDan> i miss the minigames tbh
[0:34:08] <%SilverDevilfish> We Space Marines now
[0:34:09] <%dalmek> yo okay try firing it it's AMAZING
[0:34:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> Lockpicking minigames can be fun, tho
[0:34:17] <Bailey__gaming> LAZER

[0:34:35] <TDAWS_MP132> level restriction?
[0:34:40] <+informedotaku> glory to the company
[0:34:42] <Torruun> It's a laser pistol
[0:34:43] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat A bolter is a gun that uses maglev to fire tiny metal stakes, instead of chemical explosion+bullets
[0:34:43] <Saltmeisterr> man
[0:34:44] <grayjammer> Level 5
[0:34:48] <Saltmeisterr> I don
[0:34:48] <%MonsieurHedge> questions: are aliens real people in this or is it 100% humans and alien monsters
[0:34:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> I particularly liked the matching game for hacking in ME2
[0:34:51] <MicrotonalMatt> For the emperor
[0:34:52] <TheTunnelSn8ke> We call this maneuver STEEL RAIN
[0:34:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Loot must be randomized to a degree
[0:34:53] <Kalinflip> bolt these nuts pls

[0:35:15] <%Run44forrest> PogChamp
[0:35:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> Now that is a cool lasor
[0:35:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Plasma weapons are OP in this game
[0:35:17] <+D00msDayDan> i was so disappointed when i picked up a bolter pistol for the first time and saw it only fired energy bolts
[0:35:19] <Ion_Laser> PogChamp
[0:35:20] <cureneckbeard> pew pew pew
[0:35:20] <1matheuw> ooo pew pew i like pew pews
[0:35:21] <WarchiefGoldva> It's a laser pistol! Early on! Good job, Obsidian.
[0:35:23] <ScreamLord> It looks like a flintlock
[0:35:23] <%valkuma> once i found the plasma rifle all my other guns felt obsolete
[0:35:36] <%Valdorick> Bitch Pistol
[0:35:39] <MicrotonalMatt> Not nuff dakka
[0:35:43] <Tomkins2244> Woah, your character has a LOT of weapon holsters!
[0:35:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @valkuma Same it hits so damn hard
[0:35:50] <%TaifuDragon> wait @AngriestPat where did you just pick that up from?
[0:35:51] <%dekkitout> LMG ThankEgg
[0:35:53] <KasiCrafter> Now THAT'S a lotta damage.
[0:35:56] <%Kataguro> Thanks, Spacer's Choice
[0:35:59] <+BubbaRands> pewpewpewpewpewpewpewpew~
[0:35:59] <%valkuma> BallerSwagBro9k Sneak -> charge to 5 shots -> instagib everytime
[0:36:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yup
[0:36:09] <KasiCrafter> Why does this smell like a boss fountain?
[0:36:12] <Ner234> GUN
[0:36:12] <Sokumotanaka> BFG
[0:36:14] <Gruhunchously> Pat is already a corporate shill
[0:36:19] <%XeroSigmaPrime> disable Base item stats in settings to show how your skill affects the DPS
[0:36:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> Like me a good minigun
[0:36:21] <WarchiefGoldva> It's a hguegun
[0:36:22] <%skizzuto> shooty shooty bang bang time
[0:36:24] <%Dr_Mooose> big ol gun
[0:36:24] <CrabSlacks> is there a way to turn off ironsight?
[0:36:25] <%AnIcedCoffee> Heavy weapons in this game are completely busted
[0:36:25] <gothas> !uptime
[0:36:26] <ScreamLord> That's a decent reload animation
[0:36:26] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 36m 27s.
[0:36:29] <Saltmeisterr> BIG NUMBER
[0:36:29] <%ThatOneGameTester> Number go up BIG
[0:36:29] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat judging by me also being in this building right now, this is RANDOM loot
[0:36:30] <+AllenDeadman> can we burn the town yet?
[0:36:38] <%TaifuDragon> so that's weird
[0:36:42] <%dekkitout> I was expecting you to say "ya know- I just got a really big erection"
[0:36:42] <Decsevm> pat just do the combo
[0:36:47] <$notcbo> What settings are you running this on?
[0:36:47] <Bailey__gaming> ammo does seem plentiful tbh
[0:36:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Woohoo Wahoo Wacky Space Cowboy time
[0:37:00] <Gruhunchously> Do we give the civvies a chance to run before we burn the town, or do we not?
[0:37:01] <%Nordguy> arent machine guns just "do combo" guns?
[0:37:01] <+informedotaku> everytime.inhear spacer choice I think of the real company dental's choice
[0:37:02] <Saltmeisterr> i kinda wanna do a purge everything run
[0:37:03] <WarchiefGoldva> So guys, how does it feel to explore this dark mirror of our reality?
[0:37:05] <Tomkins2244> So what's the mod support so far for this game look like? Are there any worthwhile custom quests or companions worth getting?
[0:37:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @nordguy ABSOLUTELY
[0:37:22] <%MonsieurHedge> @Tomkins2244 im pretty sure this game has been out for about two days
[0:37:24] <maebold> just got here. Hey @AngriestPat what would you say this most controls like?
[0:37:34] <%brave_sj> It's a road.
[0:37:35] <Gruhunchously> Basically, are we planning to Che Guevara it?
[0:37:40] <+informedotaku> @tomkins2244 no mod support
[0:37:40] <%GarbageNirvana> lighted?
[0:37:49] <LilMKatsu> looks almost like a ride track
[0:37:50] <KasiCrafter> Judging from how the other town goes RIGHT across a graveyard, something tells me this may have been the original town.
[0:37:51] <Bailey__gaming> this was part of the other town before the "SHITS FUCKED" stuff happend
[0:37:51] <+BubbaRands> Follow the gray future bricked road
[0:37:52] <Kalinflip> nice
[0:37:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @tomkins2244 Checked about 3 hours ago and found nothing. Probably should wait about a week
[0:37:57] <%ShineTheDiamond> @RubberFistFight Hey! Is today going any better than yesterday?
[0:37:59] <%dekkitout> I'm digging these Dr. Seuss trees
[0:38:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> I solemnly swear that Pat is up to no good
[0:38:03] <WarchiefGoldva> I think this is where the people who bailed used to live.
[0:38:04] <1matheuw> dab
[0:38:05] <Kalinflip> it lit PogChamp
[0:38:08] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Terra 1 was the Corporations' first attempt to colonized and it failed miserably
[0:38:09] <+informedotaku> new Vegas + no man's sky
[0:38:10] <maebold> Hell ya fam
[0:38:10] <TheTunnelSn8ke> pogonaDab
[0:38:13] <Kalinflip> oh shit
[0:38:15] <redrins> time dilation for more damage
[0:38:18] <+BubbaRands> hammah!
[0:38:21] <%audrus> that is the best endorsement i have ever heard for a game tbh
[0:38:27] <Kalinflip> barbarians be like:
[0:38:30] <Gruhunchously> He got his money's worth for that helmet.
[0:38:36] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Disable Base item stats to show the DPS calculated with your skill bonus
[0:38:42] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Reminds me of Infiltrator in ME.
[0:38:48] <Fro5tburn> totally-not-vats Kappa
[0:38:49] <%MonsieurHedge> by "bioshock one" do you mean there are plasmids/space magic powers orrr
[0:38:57] <WarchiefGoldva> I love bullet time. It makes my peepee the big peepee.
[0:38:58] <1matheuw> and a new rifle as well
[0:39:00] <Bailey__gaming> I like that the money is called BITS just like twitch :P
[0:39:13] <%ShineTheDiamond> @MonsieurHedge No, but it has the distopian vibe.
[0:39:13] <$Mothman742> chat how tight do u think pat is?
[0:39:13] <Gruhunchously> @WarchiefGoldva It makes you last longer
[0:39:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I wish enemies were more squishy. It's hard to make them explode like in Fallout
[0:39:22] <Monkeyweed21> give Parvati her clothes back
[0:39:23] <%CalderGaming> hobo Guardian
[0:39:31] <+Roundelay11> How does this run?
[0:39:37] <+RyuMojo> @MonsieurHedge he means the weight and feel of the gunplay/controls in bioshock 1
[0:39:42] <+AllenDeadman> does parvati not have a gun?
[0:39:59] <%CalderGaming> parv is tanky
[0:40:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> That breastblate reminds me of the Lannister armor set
[0:40:03] <+Diamond_Dynamo> My favorite sort option is weight/value ratio. It's so useful
[0:40:09] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Get rid of the Base Item Stats setting to see the skilled affected DPS on your long gun
[0:40:14] <%logoth_> Is there a Carth in this game
[0:40:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @roundelay11 Amazingly I haven't encountered any major bugs in about 6 hours and everything is smooth and fast
[0:40:17] <WarchiefGoldva> I think you can totally check her stats to know what weapons she likes to use.
[0:40:20] <Monkeyweed21> give Parvati her clothes back pat
[0:40:25] <CrabSlacks> hitting people with a hammer is mean
[0:40:27] <+AllenDeadman> huh... a girl named after the goddess of love parvati likes to mele things to death
[0:40:29] <+AllenDeadman> cool
[0:40:31] <%logoth_> Neo New Space Carth?
[0:40:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @logoth_ Yes but hes actually cool
[0:40:38] <+nekodelic> I should be playing this right now, but I'm having way too much fun watching Pat being comrade spaceman
[0:40:40] <Fro5tburn> LUL
[0:40:40] <Kalinflip> "lemme read bitch"
[0:40:49] <%dekkitout> @AllenDeadman Does that qualify as Woolie-bait?
[0:40:53] <Gruhunchously> Old Carth was Space Carth
[0:40:54] <%QuadraticGravity> change her gun?
[0:40:55] <Bailey__gaming> these deadspace ass helets
[0:40:56] <%Run44forrest> booo
[0:40:58] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Gross, just turn off the helmets, nerd
[0:41:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> Carth is ok, tbh. And besides, if you wanna be a DS player, you can easily leave him on the ship, or be a dick to him
[0:41:05] <%Nordguy> @AllenDeadman I mean, you gotta get close and personal to hit things with your melee weapons
[0:41:05] <+HyperCharge_Sam> OH SHIT
[0:41:08] <%Run44forrest> yaaay
[0:41:08] <CrabSlacks> No mod needed!
[0:41:09] <%Dr_Mooose> thank you
[0:41:11] <Dementedpenguin> Wait what?!
[0:41:12] <SpaceGuntank> its like a paper bag lol
[0:41:12] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Finally
[0:41:14] <TheTunnelSn8ke> What if the helmet is cool though?

[0:42:30] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat According to Trailers and Dev Interviews: There were 2 planets the Corporations wanted to colonize. Terra 1 and Terra 2. They tried Terra 1 first and it totally blew up in their faces. Terra 2 went much better and they abandoned Terra 1 to rot
[0:42:30] <WarchiefGoldva> Patron isn't so good at the shooting. Aspects. Of life.

[0:42:49] <+AllenDeadman> she just got shot
[0:42:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Ploobie Obisidian was always the answer. The hero we need
[0:42:51] <%goose_attack_almanac> she's down there being cute.

[0:43:13] <%KaizenChaos> WutFace
[0:43:13] <Sapphire_Breeze> loot their flesh
[0:43:13] <%snow_bush> Make use of human resources
[0:43:14] <Gruhunchously> Obsidian is the ultimate underdog story
[0:43:15] <+nekodelic> pat went full tankie vorephile
[0:43:17] <%Dr_Mooose> people meat, animal meat, same thing
[0:43:19] <+informedotaku> everyone disliked that
[0:43:24] <%dekkitout> I bet this game has cannibalism
[0:43:25] <%dalmek> Don't eat company property Pat
[0:43:30] <%MonsieurHedge> how can SAM be future pat when Woolie is already future pat
[0:43:33] <ScreamLord> @ShineTheDiamond I didn't spoil anything. The devs talked about it in interviews
[0:43:37] <ThatGuyThere03> @Dr_Mooose dawg what if people are just animals tho
[0:43:37] <Lord_of_all_Edges> Wow your character looks great! Looks just like you!
[0:43:39] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Or just find a vending machine
[0:43:41] <+BubbaRands> Well they're poor Pat what do you expect?!
[0:43:42] <LilMKatsu> @dalmek I hope so
[0:43:44] <Kalinflip> id eat the assd first
[0:43:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> All my favorite RPG's of all time are Obsidian games
[0:43:46] <Zalthia> This game is so colorful!
[0:43:50] <+informedotaku> that's vandalism
[0:44:04] <+informedotaku> is there romance?
[0:44:05] <viciousgrim> remember pat all the good meat is in the rump!
[0:44:08] <%CalderGaming> eating the ass is vandalism?
[0:44:12] <rubberpsyduck> surprised you didnt find a fully stocked assault rifle in the trash tbh
[0:44:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> But Sam is after he dies and his brain is transferred into a robot XD
[0:44:14] <WarchiefGoldva> Did you notice that you can walk through your companions? So they don't stay in front of you and get you stuck?
[0:44:15] <Lord_of_all_Edges> I mean your hair currently looks better/more kempt, but you occasionally go that crazy.
[0:44:17] <+Ploobie> I bought this game right away to support Obsidian. Don't care about people complaining about the Epic store. I think Valve needs competition (especially since their customer service sucks), and the Epic store has been very generous with great free games.
[0:44:20] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie Me too! I've been a major Obsidian shill ever since KOTOR 2.
[0:44:24] <grayjammer> Canary Building
[0:44:27] <%Dr_Mooose> @ThatGuyThere03 calm down man, that's getting to deep
[0:44:36] <ECRead> nanners, fresh from the sea. thank you, thank, I'm gonna go hang myself now
[0:44:39] <Zalthia> I might get this on ps4
[0:44:44] <+nekodelic> @informedotaku dunno about the game, but in my life there is not
[0:44:45] <CrabSlacks> how do you repair stuff?
[0:44:50] <WarchiefGoldva> Yo that's cool looking!
[0:44:53] <KasiCrafter> Planned obsolescence, @AngriestPat : (
[0:44:54] <%dalmek> y'know what, I'd imagine cannibalism would be encouraged if you were a very good worker
[0:44:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Gruhunchously I still have yet to get to Pillars 2, but man does it look good
[0:45:03] <%Run44forrest> hope this doesnt run like witcher 3 on ps4
[0:45:05] <%Conyst> mmm cubes
[0:45:05] <+BubbaRands> Cube Food! PogChamp
[0:45:14] <+Roundelay11> This game actually looks visually appealing unlike any of the Fallouts

[0:46:19] <%Valdorick> Did someone say Seig Zeon!?
[0:46:20] <CrabSlacks> I think that's a game gear?
[0:46:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Valdorick SIEG ZEON!

[0:46:54] <%titans_ace_jerid> @King_Wolf_Rigger what the fuck was that?
[0:46:55] <WarchiefGoldva> Moist books. Truly, the best way to keep them intact.
[0:46:58] <%skizzuto> missed a locker full of loot

[0:47:34] <%MegboyManuel> MegboyManuel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Sup Pat! Environment design in this game has been incredible so far, just big western space adventure. I LOVE the sound design too, every interaction just sounds great. Have you found a good shotgun yet like the ones in New Vegas though?
[0:47:36] <Monkeyweed21> blind pat missed a locker
[0:47:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> at least in this game, when you miss something, you can easily find it again
[0:48:00] <%CalderGaming> let's keep it straight tho: Halcyon is neither federation nor zeon; it's fucking Anaheim Electronics and FUCK those guys
[0:48:01] <%Rafferty3231> Is the town on fire yet?
[0:48:16] <%MegboyManuel> this town is suspiciously lacking NPCS, did Pat kill them all???
[0:48:20] <ThatGuyThere03> agreed calder
[0:48:24] <+yasahiro1011> ARE THEY DEAD YET
[0:48:28] <%Run44forrest> no its abandonned
[0:48:28] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @CalderGaming But I need my Zaku II tho
[0:48:29] <@commanderclaw> Kill them all peter
[0:48:29] <%dalmek> SOMEBODY STOP ME
[0:48:29] <%Rafferty3231> Sweet
[0:48:30] <Gruhunchously> Oil Pipeline? Sounds like a fire in the making to me.
[0:48:37] <%MegboyManuel> Did Pat genocide the town?
[0:48:38] <%floralkami> @megboymanuel this isn't the town
[0:48:46] <Gruhunchously> :Love those Space Daffodils over there.
[0:48:49] <%MegboyManuel> ooooh okay, so just random empty houses
[0:49:00] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat The Corporate big shot having a sliver of a soul is still fucking with me
[0:49:03] <%CalderGaming> @King_Wolf_Rigger fortunately anaheim didn't make that one
[0:49:30] <+yasahiro1011> OW MY EYE
[0:49:30] <%AbnormalVoid> not them
[0:49:35] <+yasahiro1011> I STILL HAVENT FINISHED PAYING FOR IT
[0:49:36] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @CalderGaming That's right! I always forget about that. They made so many though.
[0:49:39] <Gruhunchously> She a melee fighter?
[0:49:43] <%MegboyManuel> does this game have sneak attack multiplier too when crouching?
[0:49:50] <%dalmek> @MegboyManuel yes
[0:49:51] <%Dr_Mooose> his soul is a liar
[0:49:58] <snootyhooty> She said "Everyone" can you have more companions like Mass Effect?
[0:50:00] <@commanderclaw> I like that you can spec into regen
[0:50:00] <deafmutelaughing> it's almost textbook abuse
[0:50:02] <+AllenDeadman> a sliver of soul does not excuse him being a piece of garbage
[0:50:11] <%floralkami> fuck, i have to think with my own morals now, ugh...
[0:50:13] <%CalderGaming> his soul is molded perfectly to the company rhetoric
[0:50:18] <deafmutelaughing> "oh yeah, it was my fault, but I'll treat them better I *swear*"
[0:50:26] <mybigmeech> The regen is disease if on of your stats are below average
[0:50:29] <Gruhunchously> @snootyhooty I've heard you can have two companions at a time, yeah.
[0:50:37] <%MegboyManuel> OOOHHH i like that, i like how it's locked behind sneak
[0:50:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'd love an RPG where you can just bring all possible companions and just go gangsta on the Boss
[0:50:39] <mybigmeech> *disabled*
[0:50:40] <%TaifuDragon> Yes but you have to unlock it
[0:50:41] <%goose_attack_almanac> 100 Sneak - Ignore 50% of enemy Armour. That sounds really good
[0:50:42] <snootyhooty> sick
[0:50:44] <+Ablestron> @AngriestPat Corporate Big Shot? Dude is the middlest of middle management. And from the looks of things its not that hes evil, hes a fuckin dumbass who knows no other way to live
[0:50:45] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat i'm taking negative temperment and it turns off the regen so a whole class of items that boost taht regen are useless to me except i have to eat them cuz of my food addiciton
[0:50:51] <%johnny_gogo> i have a feeling that most character will have 20 sneak since you get lock picking from the same tree
[0:50:54] <%MegboyManuel> so thats why Pat stood up for his sniper "sneak" attack
[0:50:56] <%PatchworkSquid> is there weapon modification in this?
[0:50:59] <%GarbageNirvana> Wonder if there's a way to be sneaky and stabby without stretching your stats too thinly
[0:51:10] <ScreamLord> Those look like the mines in Halo 3 LUL

[0:51:43] <%GarbageNirvana> ooo

[0:51:52] <%valkuma> @Ataraxis9 not really
[0:51:55] <cureneckbeard> Put luck to fifty
[0:52:05] <%valkuma> its honestly like Fallout in Space
[0:52:07] <%MegboyManuel> what do you think of the levelling system so far?
[0:52:13] <%valkuma> its got the 50s aesthetic and everything
[0:52:15] <$Chatterbox1991> @AngriestPat does this game have radom loot like Borderlands or fixed weapon stats?
[0:52:22] <+Roundelay11> God, why did Bethesda have to shit the bed so hard? This type of game is like virtual crack when it's done well.
[0:52:27] <%AtomicVR> AtomicVR subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! atomic41Pooky apatPorgmo
[0:52:29] <%GarbageNirvana> Looks like it's random
[0:52:36] <%valkuma> @Chatterbox1991 It seems like some loot is static. Pat found the Bolter Pistol in the exact same chest that I did
[0:52:41] <WarchiefGoldva> @AngriestPat Can you read the journal?
[0:52:42] <Gruhunchously> [Parvati liked that]
[0:52:48] <%Run44forrest> youre turning the book in?
[0:52:49] <%Ataraxis9> interesting @valkuma I am just seeing lots of nods to it then.
[0:52:58] <+BubbaRands> Thick with junk in the trunk
[0:53:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> Is Parvati voiced by Katara? She sounds similar.
[0:53:02] <%MegboyManuel> God it disturbs me how much that character looks like you
[0:53:06] <%valkuma> i gave Parvati my bolter pistol since it drains ammo
[0:53:08] <%GarbageNirvana> idk that it matters?
[0:53:10] <%Wool> Why do Canadians call the electricity bill Hydro
[0:53:11] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat What Aesthetic does this game have anyway? I want to say 50s but it feels even older than that
[0:53:11] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @valkuma I came in late, so I missed it. There's a bolter pistol in the game?
[0:53:12] <VERDAXY> Full mod support coming when?
[0:53:13] <%TeaJayGee> can you read the journal?
[0:53:21] <$Mothman742> pat drowning in junk and puss
[0:53:27] <%valkuma> King_Wolf_Rigger yeah but its just a ... burst fire energy pistol, not like a crossbow or anything
