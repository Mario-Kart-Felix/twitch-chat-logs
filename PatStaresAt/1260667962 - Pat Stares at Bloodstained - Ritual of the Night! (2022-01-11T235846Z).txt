[0:23:30] <%strakillias> Well there is a big drought for releases after elden ring right?
[0:23:34] <Louie_Salmon> It's neat, but it's just a generic-ish open world game
[0:23:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> why not just continue from where you left off goblin man
[0:23:39] <%SpontaneousC> like a third if you count the dlc
[0:23:42] <%cade_calrayn> it's genuinely a good game
[0:23:42] <+Mrbaconator> 100 percent you have beaten the game by then Kappa
[0:23:43] <$SGrim> 30% counting DLC

[0:33:23] <DianaTheAscian> yeah that makes sense
[0:33:23] <R3Roundabout> Can you tweet a ROT13 of which spoiler it is?
[0:33:24] <SQDizzy> there's also the question of how they get to the twist
[0:33:30] <artoflec> @modsformeandyou no because im certain you're imagining for exactly what it is honestly
[0:33:35] <Louie_Salmon> @r3roundabout He did
[0:33:37] <stealthfart> I saw the shadowbringers ending first and then I got the chance to play the game proper to have all the context.
[0:33:40] <%GhoulishCripple> @modsformeandyou nah that's normal. a few of my buddies are that way. I was until I got accepted into the network test, that kinda broke the seal and I watched the trailers
[0:33:42] <MayShip> I got spoiled on P3 and did just that
[0:33:43] <%AoiRob> @modsformeandyou just pay attention to the new mechanic tutorials and you'll be fine. 2-handing weapons has a different input now.
[0:33:57] <R3Roundabout> @Louie_Salmon I missed that
[0:34:03] <DianaTheAscian> Oh okay LUL LUL LUL
[0:34:12] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt As much as I'd love to stay and watch you fret over gathering drops off monsters. I need to sleep. You have fun, cause shit gets much easier to farm 95% of the way through the game.
[0:34:15] <BliVru> @patstaresat any chance on playing Mount and Blade 2? itll be good against your mind goblins
[0:34:17] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat Whats your favorite twist?

[0:34:25] <huskarl_zap> Gomijull are 3d copy fitting NFTS bruuuuuuuh
[0:34:30] <Louie_Salmon> @r3roundabout Well I assumed this was about Omori, but I think he meant persona so nevermind
[0:34:42] <@Ranryu692> because we cant be trusted?
[0:34:45] <@ssjklyco> Unless you get an early copy
[0:34:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Sweet

[0:35:16] <%Nekros4442> do we know if elden ring has any new schools of magic?
[0:35:29] <%Agami23> summon help to spite those asses
[0:35:37] <@ssjklyco> I had to get help with Lord of Cinder
[0:35:39] <%justcallmebobplease> @SoFarFetched That'd be funny for ONE hunt, maybe - I assume it wasn't for just one hunt.
[0:35:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> i hate those people
[0:35:44] <%Valdorick> Rule 1 of Streaming: never trust chat. Rule 2 of Streaming: NEVER! TRUST CHAT!
[0:35:44] <+FingaLights> Why so mad, it only video game
[0:35:45] <Louie_Salmon> @nekros4442 Definitely summoning
[0:35:46] <%AoiRob> but if the boss is really sick tho
[0:35:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> "I need to prove to myself that I can solo all bosses"
[0:35:48] <R3Roundabout> @Louie_Salmon Just checked, it's the biggest spoiler in the game. Whoever spoiled that has some issues
[0:35:48] <Phrickshun> I might be considered a criminal because I hate invasions in souls
[0:35:50] <DXLelouch24> fav twist is in NEOTWEWY
[0:36:00] <jamox1> I played through all of soulsborne with my friend. It was super fun!
[0:36:14] <+hush_wolf> you ever beat the Arch Druid btw?
[0:36:14] <DianaTheAscian> As I get older I find myself doing the easy way more often in souls games
[0:36:22] <jbrachob> LOL no, you know people will still bitch about it
[0:36:22] <secret_npc> pat you ever gonna play that The Council
[0:36:28] <%AoiRob> i wonder if they'll have enemy scaling to your level/gear
[0:36:34] <Louie_Salmon> @r3roundabout I have to assume they did it out of spite or something, they can't just be that dumb
[0:36:35] <%GhoulishCripple> @patstaresat Nioh 2 helped me break past that "try hard DS1" mentality and I'm excited to say Elden Ring is going to be my first caster/faith build ever
[0:36:49] <%notsoy> owlcat's pathfinder CRPGs can be super obnoxious, i can't imagine having played wrath without toybox
[0:37:03] <%strakillias> Nothing beats replay every Mass Effect game at casual difficulty cause fuck the combat
[0:37:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Agreed
[0:37:10] <DXLelouch24> im the opposite, i could be 5000 years old but i refuse to play on easy.Ill throw myself against that wall im too stubborn
[0:37:10] <%Valdorick> And remember y'all! Play online for the first month and then *never play again without a PVP Watch dog mod!*
[0:37:14] <%Sotetsu> Hooray for cheating!
[0:37:18] <Ghufufin> kingmaker has some arbitrary difficulty spikes
[0:37:29] <%Order_of_Mystery> did a One Guy spoil Pat on something again? I missed it
[0:37:29] <@SoFarFetched> D:
[0:37:31] <Zeif00> Talk to us about lasagna Pat
[0:37:31] <artoflec> D:
[0:37:32] <ToneBacas> D:
[0:37:33] <@SoFarFetched> "ESPECIALLY YOU IN THE JURY"
[0:37:34] <+vaderxyz1970> Pat pulled the Fed and printed Moar money
[0:37:37] <IvanMistwalker> yeah owl cats games are SUPER HARD on higher difficulty
[0:37:38] <%notsoy> pat really is a yakuza substory villain
[0:37:39] <secret_npc> :)
[0:37:44] <sqointus> 7 foot frame!
[0:37:44] <%Nekros4442> If you play skeleton in wrath I hope you can get Paige to co pilot lol
[0:37:46] <modsformeandyou> I think the reason people don't like to see summoning is because then a cool boss just becomes nothing
[0:37:51] <Dio_TR> D:
[0:37:51] <%brisk_dacat> Cheat to Cheat not to win
[0:37:54] <%Agami23> if you 100% it
[0:37:55] <@Fuggins4U> Pat is just Murderface
[0:37:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:37:59] <%barrakuta371> Is it though?
[0:38:03] <ToneBacas> no no, what we mean is, getting all the collectibles takes 500h!
[0:38:08] <%Valdorick> Shadow Warrior 3 is 500 hours long if you play it 70 times!
[0:38:12] <modsformeandyou> Will Pat play Shadow Warrior 3 once it comes out?
[0:38:14] <DXLelouch24> Pat cant be Murderface he has a GF
[0:38:15] <+hush_wolf> only have time for a 400 hour game sumD
[0:38:16] <marvel877> Huh, same day as Jackass Forever in theaters.

[0:38:34] <%GhoulishCripple> "it's only 500 hours to 100%" was a defense I saw on Twitter
[0:38:40] <shotguncrucifix> AssCreed Valhalla is 500 hrs of bullshit

[0:40:12] <EynoStiles> we would never lie to you pat. lol
[0:40:22] <modsformeandyou> Pat should check out F.I.S.T. It's a cool metroidvania/action platformer with an old rabbit mc who has a huge metal fist. One of my favorite games from 2021. Super fun combat
[0:40:25] <+orochiblood> Pat is it just me or is PF in FFXIV absolute hell
[0:40:30] <tolloponik> oh I thought dlc came out for a second there

[0:41:23] <MayShip> whips are cool i've been using them and great swords more
[0:41:27] <artoflec> F.I.S.T is very cool
[0:41:34] <@Jekado> you can also jump cancel into backdash jump
[0:41:43] <%AoiRob> i hate how static movesets are in castlevania style games
[0:41:46] <%Valdorick> You have something of Luck and Pluck?
[0:41:49] <BigFingerRo> did you craft it? I don't remember seeing it anywhere, and I'm the final zone
[0:41:49] <Treasure_Vault> You want us to keep pointing out breakable walls or nah?
[0:41:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[0:42:02] <%king_wragles> THE FUCK IS ON HER HEAD
[0:42:04] <%king_wragles> oh okay
[0:42:04] <%maskofmichael> Nice blue dress
[0:42:05] <ThePlasmaSpark> is Pat enjoying the game?
[0:42:14] <SomeStrangeBroad> i love this music
[0:42:14] <@Jekado> @Treasure_Vault we are on like a 10 second delay so its not really gonna help
[0:42:15] <whoppernugget> God this intro song is so good
[0:42:17] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> YEAH Fucking pirates!
[0:42:33] <@Fuggins4U> I like them a lot
[0:42:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @maskofmichael we already did this when it was legit blue
[0:42:36] <jorniev> there are so many jojo references on this game
[0:42:39] <%Valdorick> They're pretty crunk
[0:42:40] <@Jekado> i love them i wish they weren't dead...
[0:42:41] <ExpressNode> They aight
[0:42:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> They're the shit
[0:42:47] <%trekkie11041> god this music is so good
[0:42:48] <%JustToWatch> a little bit huh
[0:42:50] <SuperGoblinPunch> I loves em
[0:42:50] <marvel877> like them
[0:42:53] <@Jekado> I hope there is gonna be  DS COLLECTION ON PC
[0:42:59] <jorniev> this game scrached such a an itch
[0:43:00] <DianaTheAscian> I like the pure platformer ones more than these tbh
[0:43:00] <BigFingerRo> I love em, this game scratched the castlevania itches real good
[0:43:01] <+hush_wolf> oh you have a mmap thing
[0:43:03] <@Jekado> COME ONE PC DS COLELCTION!
[0:43:03] <%maskofmichael> Never really played Castlevania
[0:43:04] <%MonsterEnvy> I think the right stick or something can  let you go through premade loadouts
[0:43:06] <californaya> I can only play Metroidvanias, not actual Castlevanias
[0:43:08] <+pupil31> SourPls
[0:43:09] <OBS_VinnieK> oh Awesome, nice to see Pat returning to Bloodstained
[0:43:12] <SaltyAzteca> Pat can now Dive kick
[0:43:14] <+TopTieramisu> listen to this not-castlevania music
[0:43:21] <%JobbedBone> complete rectangles Kreygasm
[0:43:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Jekado with emulators everything is on pc
[0:43:26] <@ssjklyco> You have to find an item to unlock them
[0:43:27] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Because you haven't unlocked them yet.
[0:43:30] <%king_wragles> I've never payed a single Castlevania, would this be an okay place to start?
[0:43:34] <%pectusumbra> alright, out of the shower. how HUGE is pat now
[0:43:39] <%AoiRob> gotta find the extra slots
[0:43:42] <%Agami23> i mean some metroidvanias give you better endings for map completion. like i think momodora does that
[0:43:43] <%Valdorick> DIVE! KICK!
[0:43:43] <@Jekado> @doc_ock_rokc yeah but having an offical collection would be nice
[0:43:47] <%FacetiousAF> @pectusumbra medium
[0:43:55] <modsformeandyou> How can we recommend games for Pat to play?
[0:43:56] <+TopTieramisu> probably a backer
[0:43:57] <%pectusumbra> got ya
[0:43:57] <%spitelite> dive kick with boot weapons is really good
[0:43:57] <@Jekado> GUN
[0:44:02] <DianaTheAscian> GUN
[0:44:03] <@SoFarFetched> @king_wragles so you pirated them all? geefThink
[0:44:06] <artoflec> i could never get into the guns in this game
[0:44:07] <%waltzqueen> What bosses did he kill so far?
[0:44:08] <jorniev> that gun  has a special move
[0:44:15] <%AoiRob> oh i never used guns lmao
[0:44:19] <@Jekado> you can change the secondary part of guns to change the bullet type
[0:44:20] <%pectusumbra> I mean it's a gun, what did you expect?
[0:44:22] <$KnightAsteran> kill them wit hthe power of friendship, and this gun you found
[0:44:22] <%FacetiousAF> @SoFarFetched hahahahah chimken psaGib
[0:44:22] <jorniev> THAT GUN HAS FULL AOUTO TECHNICUQ
[0:44:23] <%MonsterEnvy> @waltzqueen I think the Hand was the last boss he killed
[0:44:27] <%king_wragles> @SoFarFetched No?
[0:44:28] <@SoFarFetched> @FacetiousAF geefChicken
[0:44:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Oh pat a small update I got all my friday nights back... but I am not a professor this semester
[0:44:45] <OkamiDude15> @king_wragles i dont see why not
[0:44:46] <@Jekado> some bullets will also have like homing or whatnot
[0:44:49] <@SoFarFetched> @king_wragles "king_wragles: I've never payed a single Castlevania, " geefSmugAF
[0:44:59] <+TheBitingIrish> Gun damage is mostly from ammo
[0:45:04] <artoflec> yeah the inside looks better than the outside
[0:45:05] <vile_brand> pat i dont remember correctly but i think there are hidden breakable rooms
[0:45:09] <jorniev> my favorite room is the save room
[0:45:09] <jowi_time> eew spermies!!
[0:45:11] <%AoiRob> personally i think Hollow Knight and Ender Lilies are more enjoyable than this game but it' still pretty good
[0:45:14] <%AncelDeLambert> Fetched is engaging in a mild amount of tom-foolery
[0:45:17] <+TopTieramisu> imagine if this game looked like deedlit in wonder labyrinth
[0:45:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> DIVE KICKED
[0:45:24] <@SoFarFetched> @AncelDeLambert AS A TREAT
[0:45:27] <californaya> gonna take this time to recommend Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth
[0:45:31] <modsformeandyou> @AoiRob Check out F.I.S.T
[0:45:33] <californaya> if y'all like Metroidvanias
[0:45:33] <BigFingerRo> Hey Pat, would you say it's a basic bitch thing to say platformers are your favorite genre?
[0:45:35] <@Fuggins4U> i love Korn
[0:45:35] <%AoiRob> this game's visual style ranges from "ew" to "ok" to "oh cool."
[0:45:38] <californaya> I just beat it myself
[0:45:41] <@Jekado> Some chest do respawn so be warned for mind goblin sake.  They drop craftables or consumables usually
[0:45:47] <%pectusumbra> @AoiRob I'd say this is different enough to Hollow Knight that they are giving you different experiences
[0:45:47] <%MonsterEnvy> Have you started making food for that old lady
[0:45:56] <WoolieVersus> 368 raiders from WoolieVersus have joined!

[0:49:08] <%Pappajimbo> beat the hanging mini boss
[0:49:10] <Fabpsi_> he got there really good. Chat was emote only (the only way it can be tbh in that situation)
[0:49:11] <iswearimjustdandy> He did pretty good!
[0:49:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> "Find out"
[0:49:20] <%IronOhki> Laura is goblin child.
[0:49:24] <%tank7013> You get to find that out in the apartments really
[0:49:24] <jorniev> IT REALLY IS
[0:49:27] <%LowSkillGod> Woolie is going to murder Maria with his bare hands at the rate things are going
[0:49:30] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt As you explore more of the Castle OD lets you take out more books so don't forget to check back to see if he well let you take out extras
[0:49:31] <modsformeandyou> Will Patrick check out Nioh devs's Final Fantasy in March?
[0:49:31] <+TopTieramisu> luck build best build
[0:49:34] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I think he just got to finding out Laura is a brat
[0:49:35] <%Agami23> like woolie got WAY farther than you'd think
[0:49:36] <%Valdorick> Luck is too stronk
[0:49:36] <%StephanieSadGirl> I am so god damned hype I cant even explain it!  I love SH2 so god damned much
[0:49:40] <penitentpendant> Unfortunately, this game falls under the 'buff luck unless in boss fight' category of game
[0:49:41] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:49:46] <%AoiRob> lucky ted rises once again
[0:49:46] <$lotharrio> Aw yeah, Bloodstained
[0:49:46] <%AncelDeLambert> the game isn't so hard that you NEED defensive stats anyways, and you'll do a lot of farming by the end, so LCK is straight better
[0:49:47] <FullMetalSnorlax> Luck also increases your crit chance
[0:49:58] <californaya> oh dude, I spent way too much time grinding for drops in this
[0:50:00] <%Valdorick> I think there's even a... food or trait that ups other stats based on luck?
[0:50:01] <@Jekado> make sure to take out ALL THE BOOKS from OD eventually
[0:50:02] <BigFingerRo> my GOD I love me some good platforming, it gives me many good strong brain chemicals
[0:50:02] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oooh crits are nice
[0:50:04] <jorniev> O.D BACKWARDS IS D.O
[0:50:04] <DXLelouch24> theres loadouts so its fine
[0:50:07] <%pectusumbra> that's a key item
[0:50:15] <%FacetiousAF> isn't the bromide a boss drop?
[0:50:24] <%IronOhki> Hey folks from Woolie's stream: did you notice how many times Woolie investigated Angela's knife? Were you counting?
[0:50:41] <%AoiRob> square grid maps are such a pain in the ass to read. it's not even zone color coded
[0:50:46] <BigFingerRo> my man is O.D! straight up COOKING mfs!
[0:50:47] <%waltzqueen> @IronOhki didn't count but it was a lot
[0:50:48] <OkamiDude15> im gonna assume someone told pat about eating food the first time gives passive stat boosts
[0:50:50] <%Pappajimbo> yep
[0:50:58] <jorniev> NOBODY TELL WOOLIE NOTHIN
[0:50:59] <+toomuchsnarf> my mama
[0:50:59] <%LowSkillGod> did he ever examine it proper?
[0:51:05] <marvel877> oh
[0:51:06] <NireFuster> Woolie actually didn't examine the knife that much I think
[0:51:06] <KaiserMario> he's almost never fully healing too
[0:51:07] <%Agami23> he tried to use it as a usable item on pyramid head because he didnt think he could fight him
[0:51:07] <%LowSkillGod> I dont know if he did
[0:51:11] <%IronOhki> @jorniev Agree strongly.
[0:51:12] <marvel877> no one tell him
[0:51:14] <%king_wragles> Good job highlighting that, what with Woolie still in the chat n all
[0:51:17] <Tomrin> So many waifus in this game
[0:51:18] <%waltzqueen> @IronOhki and staring at mary's photo. at this rate i would think he Knows
[0:51:23] <modsformeandyou> Will Pat stare at Nioh people's Final Fantasy F the Chaos in March?
[0:51:24] <penitentpendant> During the 'stuck with Pyramid Head waiting for the water to drain fight' he spammed the picture, letter and knife.
[0:51:26] <NireFuster> He's also healing a lot of times
[0:51:27] <%JobbedBone> music for a found harmonium LUL
[0:51:36] <+Tucker0603> wait is woolie on SH2 already?
[0:51:36] <%IronOhki> @NireFuster He did it a few times, thinking it would "solve" the PH fight. But he is determined to figure out what it's for.
[0:51:40] <NireFuster> Doubt it
[0:51:41] <DianaTheAscian> I'm very curious what ending Wooile will stumble into
[0:51:45] <shotguncrucifix> mario 64 ass evil flying books
[0:51:46] <%IronOhki> He does NOT know about the ending conditions.
[0:51:50] <+rasend0ri> Hold up when near the suckubus
[0:51:50] <%Agami23> he does not know the ending conditions. he was trying to actively use the knife on stuff
[0:51:53] <KaiserMario> Wait, Woolie's here?
[0:51:53] <@SoFarFetched> watch woolie st ill be in chat and hear this

[0:52:08] <Tomrin> This ost SingsNote
[0:52:11] <%LowSkillGod> @NireFuster he used it but didnt examine it
[0:52:12] <%king_wragles> @KaiserMario Ya! And everyone is doing the spoils! Ain't it fun?
[0:52:13] <NireFuster> Right, Woolie thinks the knife is an item for a future puzzle so he's trying to figure out what it's for LUL
[0:52:14] <%StephanieSadGirl> Woolie is like, I was able to shoot those kids in 1, maybe I can stab Laura in 2
[0:52:15] <%tank7013> Unless the chat listing is wrong Woolie is definitely not here
[0:52:16] <Lagseene_> God I hope Woolie is not here
[0:52:18] <%AoiRob> this ost slaps

[0:53:54] <SauceJockey> oh hell yeah this part
[0:53:56] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> man this areas ost SLAPS
[0:53:57] <@Fuggins4U> SOTN is still really freaking good
[0:54:00] <SomeOtherNeb> Pat's a Simp-ony of the night
[0:54:03] <BigFingerRo> Aria of Sorrow is best Castlevania, don't  @ me
[0:54:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> Random Silent Hill theory: Silent hill is actually some sort of eldrich plant and that is why every "Good" ending has you leaving with someone from silent hill. They are a seed that spreads silent hill around
[0:54:05] <Zeif00> sotn is the goat
[0:54:06] <DianaTheAscian> Symphony is okay
[0:54:07] <+Shady_Zaku> Fuggiiiins
[0:54:10] <%TheDullaMAN> Hey Pat, just got in, what'd I miss?
[0:54:13] <%pectusumbra> I do need to play symphony myself
[0:54:17] <%AncelDeLambert> this area is NOT fun to backtrack through while looking for ONE THING
[0:54:20] <%AoiRob> hollow knight lives in my head rent free
[0:54:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> No Simpy of the night
[0:54:23] <BigFingerRo> @SomeOtherNeb Simp-iny, learn the lore
[0:54:25] <modsformeandyou> Am I a heretic for liking Lord of Shadows?
[0:54:29] <SaltyAzteca> Favourite OST in SOTN?
[0:54:35] <shotguncrucifix> woolie is gonna get the boromir ending in sh2
[0:54:36] <KaiserMario> No love for Lords of Shadow? LUL
[0:54:42] <DXLelouch24> @modsformeandyou yes
[0:54:42] <%President_Miyazaki> For me it's Symphony, Aria, and then this
[0:54:45] <BigFingerRo> One(1) Simpy for pat
[0:54:59] <MayShip> or you had to jump on the lamps
[0:55:01] <%justcallmebobplease> If only the map marker and geo-collecter things were just quality-of-life features, and not fighting for badge space.
[0:55:03] <%tpc28> Dead Cells forever hyzengOp
[0:55:04] <%President_Miyazaki> Can you kick off that lanterns?
[0:55:05] <@Lion_kun> You think a best of Mass Effect will be put on the channel at some point?
[0:55:06] <marvel877> Really wish we could get a release of the OG audio for SOTN and not that PSP re-release they got on PS4.
[0:55:08] <modsformeandyou> Check out F.I.S.T. It's a good metroidvania from 2021
[0:55:10] <DXLelouch24> LoS killed Castlevania so kindly trip on a rock
[0:55:17] <%AoiRob> you can dive kick the lanterns
[0:55:18] <OBS_VinnieK> @PatStaresAt trying to not be a bother with this, but the Sanjiegun staff you picked up has a pretty cool technique on it if you press forward forward attack.
[0:55:18] <%Bt_Robot> Use divekick on the lanterns to get those two chests
[0:55:19] <%justcallmebobplease> That's the one part of Hollow Knight I'll actually shit on, just a little - those two things should not have been badges.
[0:55:19] <%The_0_2_Hero> When I played this game it felt very "2012 XLBA" to me with like the UI and visual style. Closest I can compare is like, Valid Story
[0:55:22] <%kainhighwind1990> oh btw, I just finished Zhloe's colletable quests in 14. Which one should I do after her? (ie which is the best after?)
[0:55:23] <SaltyAzteca> nice crit
[0:55:23] <%The_0_2_Hero> *Valdis
[0:55:30] <%MonsterEnvy> It is

[0:57:04] <%MonsterEnvy> You have to go down a bit
[0:57:07] <marvel877> @godzookylives I got it on PS3, but I really would like to see the old one on Switch, but Konami does not want to put in the work to port it elsewhere without using the PSP version.
[0:57:08] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Ask Patches to kick you down tehre
[0:57:14] <%pectusumbra> I mean I do dig it myself. It's a nice twist on what would otherwise just be a straight shot up
[0:57:20] <%MonsterEnvy> Now go up

[1:01:44] <fuji_n2> I'll watch it and still come here and say stop being bad
[1:01:45] <Fenlig> Im pretty sure Peach was controlling it from off camera while pat was acting
[1:01:46] <+threamstream> tbh it's not his fault the decision to make this rotate makes depth harder to gauge

[1:08:50] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh nice!
[1:08:53] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Whats your favorite non-Metroid Castlevania?
[1:08:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GAGR is a nightmare
[1:08:56] <%Valdorick> Kingmaker
[1:09:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Why?
[1:09:07] <+Grayhammatter> he's playing kingmaker
[1:09:11] <DXLelouch24> @ChaosedStar yyes but Max is insane
[1:09:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> But Wrath is better
[1:09:27] <%Mr_Pylon> EEEE OOOOOO

[1:09:44] <%Buttlo> I stared at mythic paths for like two hours before I finally made up my mind on which one to go and then I ended up kinda sorta making a mistake with my choice.

[1:09:52] <%Nekros4442> fair enough got confuzzled
[1:09:53] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Started playing this after Pat's last stream. Randomizer Mode's stupid fun
[1:09:54] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The game is so awkward looking
[1:10:00] <+Tucker0603> @ballerswagbro9k I agree but kingmaker is fully complete
[1:10:05] <%Buttlo> But I don't think that it matters TOO much but then I found out I missed something big and made a new character.
[1:10:10] <modsformeandyou> Is the Act Raiser remake good?
[1:10:13] <+ChaosedStar> @DXLelouch24 yee yee, Simmons was showing off his platformer skills. loved watching em bash their heads in on it haha

[1:12:38] <%LowSkillGod> the bong resin in my lungs did save me from covid
[1:12:38] <%umbranviking> of course it does!!
[1:12:39] <Fenlig> Not as effective as pee though
[1:12:41] <%MonsterEnvy> You should try that shard it's really good
[1:12:44] <@PeachSaliva> @AncelDeLambert read the study then

[1:12:52] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Smokes weeds kids!
[1:12:52] <%bamberfool> by vaping or edibles, smoking it is still bad tho
[1:12:53] <@PeachSaliva> @JK_Spencer go look
[1:12:53] <SaltyAzteca> SNOOP DOG KNEW FROM THE START
[1:12:54] <+rasend0ri> Peach Salvia
[1:12:54] <$Echlir> So thats why all the anti-vaxxer pot heads at work are still ok eh?
[1:12:56] <%AoiRob> try teps oceus its rlly good
[1:12:56] <lonosis47> Isnt that just literally speculation tho.
[1:12:59] <%RealThiele> im fighting covid snoop style right now
[1:13:00] <%ospreyworks> that can't be true

[1:13:03] <SauceJockey> @PatStaresAt use that shard it's good
[1:13:05] <artoflec> shoulda let snoop dogg take over NY in Def Jam tbqh

[1:13:13] <%maskofmichael> At times like this I wish my state had legal weed
[1:13:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt We knew this canabus when smoked blocks the a2 receptors. Normal smoking does the same thing
[1:13:15] <%kyh9> Snoop Dogg?  The guy who keeps trying to sell me Crypto and NFT shit?
[1:13:17] <%ospreyworks> my parents are huge potheads and my mom got it in 2020
[1:13:20] <+NecDW4> I dont remember if i ever got the chain lightening, but MAN the ghost heads were INSANELY OP before they got nerfed
[1:13:22] <heartlesshealer> weed makes you less likely to go outside too, so there's that :p
[1:13:24] <%FacetiousAF> lol zap
[1:13:27] <DianaTheAscian> That explains why my friends haven't gotten covid despite going outside quite often

[1:22:53] <artoflec> yeah its shit lobosKek
[1:22:53] <+TopTieramisu> that's just the ds3 dragon head
[1:22:54] <+Grayhammatter> PIG is FED
[1:22:54] <SaltBuster> LUL
[1:22:54] <%luckysteak> yeah, that one is actually bad
[1:22:58] <captain_kirkhammer> I bet it's super broken when you level it up
[1:23:00] <%MonsterEnvy> It's strong but costs too much mana
[1:23:03] <OkamiDude15> reach extends when leveled probably
[1:23:05] <%AoiRob> back to teps oceus
[1:23:06] <modsformeandyou> Has Pat ever finished this game before? Or is it now blind content for him?
[1:23:07] <%king_wragles> @AlucardX60 That's not even what hardlock means?? Hardlock is when you get stuck in the game, and there's no way out. Soft means you can??
[1:23:09] <%RealThiele> thats not great
[1:23:11] <jfp4life> SIck, nice seeing Pat give this game another go
[1:23:12] <FullMetalSnorlax> DPS is insane, range increase as you upgrade it
[1:23:13] <fuji_n2> only good fire spells are the Riga ones
[1:23:19] <%alphonseisbest> coxJam
[1:23:21] <+rasend0ri> It does a lot of damage
[1:23:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @kainhighwind1990 worst case just leave and take the penalty, it only matters if you get 3 in a day and the odds of that happening again are pretty low
[1:23:27] <%MonsterEnvy> How
[1:23:28] <%alphonseisbest> gigaboOtsAngyEvil
[1:23:29] <%FacetiousAF> bloodless beat my ass
[1:23:32] <SaltyAzteca> yo bloodless fucks
[1:23:36] <%Valdorick> @kainhighwind1990 Stone Vigil is awful. Its just the right level range than classes aren't complete, just right where tanks start thinking they're hot shit and pull EVERYTHING (when they can't survive)
[1:23:37] <%MonsterEnvy> She is a much later boss
[1:23:42] <%greasypete00> kateJam
[1:23:43] <%MonsterEnvy> did you sequence break
[1:23:46] <%Logoth_> Parts of this game looks really rough
[1:23:47] <artoflec> fight bloodless but make the blood colour White pipopuParched
[1:23:48] <%alphonseisbest> Pat why no animated Emotes?
[1:23:51] <+MashinChaserR> lytJIVE
[1:23:54] <%AoiRob> remember that dead end for later, pat
[1:23:54] <FullMetalSnorlax> @AlucardX60 no Hardlock meens hardware is broken, softlock means software is broken
[1:23:58] <fuji_n2> bloodless is a hard boss first playthrough
[1:24:00] <captain_kirkhammer> You probably fought Bloodless too early by sequyence-brteaking with lamp-kick jump-resetting
[1:24:04] <artoflec> ok :)
[1:24:06] <Sonny_Firestorm> Yeah, fight bloodless with blood color set to white. Kappa
[1:24:07] <%notsoy> i doubt they want you to run all the way back up
[1:24:07] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Maybe it feels better when you're holding the controller, but the jumping doesn't look satisfying.
[1:24:09] <DianaTheAscian> Does Pat know what those are?
[1:24:15] <%twistedj3ster> it's also kinda boring to climb more than once
[1:24:15] <%alphonseisbest> no, but i'll pay u for 11

[1:31:28] <DXLelouch24> mod isnt that hard btw, Chat are just babies
[1:31:29] <+Kyma1020> Xenogears?
[1:31:33] <%pectusumbra> that's a good one to level, big AoE
[1:31:34] <$lotharrio> Luck boosts are crazy in this game.
[1:31:34] <%FacetiousAF> fwog
[1:31:34] <fuji_n2> imagine 100 luck
[1:31:36] <%RealThiele> curse ladies
[1:31:37] <+NecDW4> high luck FUCKS in Metrodvanias
[1:31:39] <artoflec> @ssjklyco well it adds in fights that don't exist in the base game, they just made new shit
[1:31:40] <%FacetiousAF> oh there's a cameo down here Kappa
[1:31:52] <%kainhighwind1990> best music in the game imo
[1:31:57] <SirNewton2> Library of ruina is turn-based, kinda.
[1:31:57] <$StrawberryPantsu> Yo this theme fucks
[1:31:58] <%Celarious> CBT waterway time
[1:32:00] <%luckysteak> wow, you got here late
[1:32:02] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, it's a fuck
[1:32:05] <Mattais88> Yeah
[1:32:05] <artoflec> i HATE water elaREE
[1:32:07] <fuji_n2> yeah.
[1:32:07] <+NecDW4> Water part was EZ
[1:32:07] <%pectusumbra> yes but a little later
[1:32:08] <%FacetiousAF> yeah you need a certain magic to deal with the water
[1:32:10] <SaltyAzteca> oh listen, its not Crystal Teardrops
[1:32:12] <+AlucardX60> There is a pretty bad progression shard here.
[1:32:16] <%Logoth_> all waterways must have lowkey jazz
[1:32:17] <%TheDullaMAN> To travel through water, you need to farm a specific soul
[1:32:18] <the_baghdaddy> Luck is fantastic. It’s super clutch late game when certain crafting items are 1% drops
[1:32:23] <%spitelite> you will need to look up how to do it
[1:32:24] <DXLelouch24> theres also some crazy people making a voice mod for FF7
[1:32:25] <Komayeda> it's a pretty big area with pretty far apart save points
[1:32:28] <modsformeandyou> Resonance of Fate is a good somewhat hidden turn-based JRPG. Most fun I've had with that type of game
[1:32:28] <OkamiDude15> theres an mob enemy that you need a shard to swim underwater before you get the walk under water shard
[1:32:28] <$StrawberryPantsu> You can swim underwater,but it sucks shit. You'll see.
[1:32:35] <fuji_n2> it's bad way to progress that part imo
[1:32:39] <UnImprest> @jorniev mimic i think
[1:32:44] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> FF7 New Threat remixes FF7 with new scenarios and boss fights (e.g. Yuffie steals your shit in the first inn out of Midgar)
[1:32:58] <artoflec> @modsformeandyou that game is suepr fun but it is very repetitive, they kinda gave you all the mechanics up front
[1:33:06] <Treasure_Vault> This area has a ton of secret walls.
[1:33:14] <SQDizzy> LUL
[1:33:15] <+Grayhammatter> swimming underwater can be pretty shit in this game
[1:33:15] <Paltheos> Hm. The whip seems pretty good. I tend to prefer greatswords but the reach you get for your speed on the whip looks good.
[1:33:20] <fuji_n2> nice one dude
[1:33:20] <OkamiDude15> did someone say some stupid shit?
[1:33:21] <DXLelouch24> yuffie and Vincent are also not optional in new Threat
[1:33:24] <SQDizzy> chat does a chat
[1:33:24] <kinkade_77> nice one
[1:33:25] <%fat_burtreynolds> lol demon design: what if he had 5 legs tho
[1:33:27] <ExpressNode> What happened I wasn't reading chat
[1:33:27] <+wizard_of_diamonds> What did I miss?
[1:33:28] <%RealThiele> LUL
[1:33:30] <Komayeda> dammit...
[1:33:32] <modsformeandyou> True, I just want more people to try Resonance of Fate
[1:33:32] <fuji_n2> spoiled a thing
[1:33:32] <%pectusumbra> huh, wow, didn't even see that one
[1:33:32] <+TopTieramisu> one week?
[1:33:33] <OkamiDude15> thanks chat very cool
[1:33:34] <+TopTieramisu> only?

[1:33:39] <Komayeda> someone spoiled somethin
[1:33:40] <SirNewton2> what happened?
[1:33:42] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh damn

[1:33:49] <@Fuggins4U> don't spoil stuff plz
[1:33:50] <%studleydoorite> the caps made that seem very deliberate

[1:34:15] <heartlesshealer> Shovel Knight's in every game
[1:34:16] <chhdez> Shovelverse
[1:34:17] <OBS_VinnieK> I do not know why people always do stuff like that
[1:34:17] <zzNamttamzz> Hey Look
[1:34:17] <$lotharrio> Well I'm curious. Anyone wanna PM me what the gone guy said?
[1:34:17] <SomeStrangeBroad> silly dummies spoliers are for losers
[1:34:17] <+RowenCleric> a dude donated to Woolz and was like "get ready to cry at the end of silent hill 2"!
[1:34:20] <fuji_n2> speaking of which
[1:34:25] <akitanito> all he had to do was shut up for 5 minutes
[1:34:26] <heartlesshealer> Shovel Knight for E.T. Atari
[1:34:26] <+pkmamsters> it's the capitalizing that gets me
[1:34:27] <%RealThiele> uno hombre
[1:34:29] <%cvp5127> LUL
[1:34:29] <fuji_n2> IMAGINE
[1:34:29] <%Valdorick> Just had to wait ONE screen
[1:34:30] <OkamiDude15> why are people like this
[1:34:32] <SaltyAzteca> Is that Crazy Talk Requiem?
[1:34:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> IMAGINE IF PAT HAD SEEN THAT TOOO
[1:34:33] <UncleMcgoo> someone kinda did it to woolie today
[1:34:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> NotLikeThis
[1:34:34] <%MidnightBurst12> whoops
[1:34:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> Congratulations on your one week timeout award for being a fuckin' chud.
[1:34:35] <@Jekado> could of just waited...
[1:34:36] <%charp35> Thanks guy
[1:34:36] <%zeroarturia> Fuck that guy
[1:34:37] <%notsoy> every once in a while someone comes along and makes you question whether human rights should be universal
[1:34:39] <@Fuggins4U> a surprised denied
[1:34:40] <Mattais88> What might have been...
[1:34:41] <%terry_irvin> just ban the chat
[1:34:43] <+MGSKomodoDragon> Sub-only mode for a bit?
[1:34:43] <@SoFarFetched> This is why Pat and Woolie can't trust chat.
[1:34:45] <%Blank9> god the "get ready to cry at the end of silent hill 2" was awful
[1:34:46] <@SoFarFetched> EVER
[1:34:46] <+NecDW4> RIPPER!
[1:34:46] <+Grayhammatter> one goddamn screen
[1:34:46] <%kainhighwind1990> fuck that guy

[1:34:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> One guy DENIED
[1:34:48] <alroy909> oh look its shovel knight what a surprise that we did not expect
[1:34:48] <%TheDullaMAN> Pat, farm that enemy for a cool thing
[1:34:48] <OBS_VinnieK> just ONE screen you had to wait
[1:34:49] <artoflec> ban them forever
[1:34:49] <SQDizzy> a week seems too short
[1:34:49] <%cvp5127> cucked
[1:34:51] <$StrawberryPantsu> YO WAS THAT SHOVEL KNIGHT!?
[1:34:52] <fuji_n2> reaction dekied
[1:34:53] <@Jekado> could of just Cross Tekken'd it and wait out the clock
[1:34:53] <%alphonseisbest> but what if u missed it?
[1:34:54] <OkamiDude15> just shoot the chat
[1:34:55] <%Mr_Pylon> It keeps happening
[1:34:55] <%alphonseisbest> Kappa
[1:34:56] <Komayeda> we really need to put a no spoilers tag there
[1:34:56] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt someone did that to Woolie LITERALLY TODAY
[1:34:59] <%MugenSandan> BUT MISTER STREAMER YOU NEEDED TO KNOW psaGoblin
[1:35:00] <%kyh9> fandoms need to die
[1:35:01] <%RealThiele> DISC ROOM
[1:35:03] <%fat_burtreynolds> At this fuggin point dude, Doomguy is shovel knight
[1:35:03] <tattleworm> he definitely drops something
[1:35:05] <%luckysteak> woolie had his stream on emote only for this reason
[1:35:05] <+Jiggisnipe> some people really can't help themselves huh
[1:35:06] <SomeStrangeBroad> asshole
[1:35:07] <artoflec> no Pat you see they're called SHOVEL ARMOR
[1:35:07] <Paltheos> Oh hey that is Shovel Knight.
[1:35:08] <%SveriSageAdvice> i dont understand why its literally so hard to just not spoil
[1:35:08] <kingra> He does drop some cool shit
[1:35:08] <fuji_n2> yeah he drops so shit bro
[1:35:10] <%pectusumbra> he has goodies, and there's multiple of him down here
[1:35:13] <Paltheos> I... didn't realize.
[1:35:15] <SomeStrangeBroad> big stupid asshole
[1:35:16] <%livlinn> Can you capture Shovel guy
[1:35:18] <%Blank9> "get ready to cry at the end of silent hill 2"
[1:35:19] <DXLelouch24> i dont know i was taking dodgs out, but emote mode when i came back
[1:35:20] <heartlesshealer> today even?
[1:35:23] <%tank7013> Someone was like "I can't wait to see them cry at the ending" for silent hill 2
[1:35:25] <$lotharrio> Oh that's why he was on emote only?
[1:35:25] <+polothegreatest> that sucks
[1:35:25] <@SoFarFetched> Woolie should just forever put his streams in emote mode.
[1:35:26] <%kyh9> @SveriSageAdvice people are children
[1:35:27] <heartlesshealer> what was the game?
[1:35:29] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh is that why Woolie's chat was in emote mode for the rest of Silent Hill 2?
[1:35:31] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> The worst part is when they turn around and don't understand what they did wrong. "It's not that big of a spoiler!"
[1:35:31] <SaltBuster> the fairy pushed that guy into you lol
[1:35:33] <%maskofmichael> The only way to stop being spoiled is to play games in private, even though I know that's impossible for you in this field but it's a sad truth.
[1:35:34] <%SuckerPunchSyd> If he doesnt drop the shovel Id be so mad
[1:35:36] <ExpressNode> I remember him dropping something but it wasn't impressive
[1:35:44] <%AlteisenReiseZ> HEY PAT DID YOU KNOW THIS GAME HAS A WHIP LUL
[1:35:45] <%tank7013> Shit like that is exactly why people were telling them to stop reading chat
[1:35:45] <%Valdorick> Come on, Max Luck
[1:35:50] <%Valdorick> Luck god, luck god
[1:35:52] <gotanysnacks> Oh man if he's playing Silent Hill 2 that's a spoiler landmine
[1:35:54] <%luftraumm1> woolies chat is wilder than yours pat
[1:35:54] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> As Patton Oswalt would say, that chat spoiler will miss everything cool and die angry...
[1:35:55] <%BigCoffee> Are you trying to main the whip?
[1:35:55] <%zeroarturia> I really feel playing this again, I want to try to %
[1:35:55] <godila2> @SoFarFetched it was mostly in emote only mode, it was dumb ass donation
[1:35:56] <heartlesshealer> oh god spoiling SILENT HILL 2? What's wrong with people?
[1:36:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> If woolie somehow BUMBLES his way into dog ending that "Get ready to cry bit will be HILARIOUS
[1:36:06] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @sverisageadvice yeah pretty much people were just posting the puzzles without a chance to think on em
[1:36:06] <alroy909> that explains why when I came back to woolies stream a bit later it was now emote only
[1:36:09] <MaesePC> NEVER GIVE UP!
[1:36:10] <%notsoy> imagine people being so fucking stupid that you have to play every game on emote-only, not just the really story-heavy ones
[1:36:15] <artoflec> god what a dickhead to spoil it ONE room away from seeing it elaPain
[1:36:16] <+Grayhammatter> oh come on shovel knight, why you do this?
[1:36:17] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> My favorite park of Silent Hill is when Shovel Knight shows up.
[1:36:18] <fuji_n2> come back later with a luck build
[1:36:19] <Ipsenscastle> @doc_ock_rokc LUL I wish
[1:36:23] <@SoFarFetched> @godila2 oh no I know,but with how many times woolie just can't even look at chat without seeing someone unable to contain themselves. It should just forever be in emote mode.
[1:36:26] <%SveriSageAdvice> @SuckerPunchSyd greattttt...
[1:36:27] <DXLelouch24> imagine if they spoiled something like 13 Sentinels, id IP ban them
[1:36:31] <%livlinn> Good thing Royal guards are happy to be jailed succinJail woolieGASM
[1:36:32] <artoflec> but you CAN spoil cool shit in this game and that sucks lol
[1:36:33] <@StridentSong> A good way to check without getting spoiled on monsters is their bestiary entry will show a ?????? for items and potential shards if they have anything to drop
[1:36:34] <SaltyAzteca> Oh yeah THATS how you unlock that
[1:36:35] <kinkade_77> because of the omori thing
[1:36:37] <+balouie> watching you play makes me want to play the randomized  version of this
[1:36:39] <%Blank9> it was emote only for like 4 and a half hours lol
[1:36:41] <the_baghdaddy> How are you liking the whip? Favorite weapon type?
[1:36:42] <%tank7013> Streamer you NEED to have the same exoerience as them
[1:36:42] <SaltyAzteca> Completely forgot
[1:36:43] <%TheDullaMAN> You won't be able to get back up easily after going down that waterfall, so explore
[1:36:43] <Komayeda> honestly? I *never* used shortcuts in this game
[1:36:43] <%Zebroneath> I've been getting annoyed as a viewer as well by these people
[1:36:45] <%king_wragles> @SoFarFetched Woolie can't even look at PAT'S CHAT without getting SH spoilers
[1:36:47] <%fat_burtreynolds> Winter sads
[1:36:47] <DianaTheAscian> Didn't someone spoil this game last time you streamed it?
[1:36:48] <Tracazoid> Amazing how you got through Endwalker without any spoils
[1:36:57] <heartlesshealer> Might have to make use of the "first time playthrough" tags
[1:36:57] <HeroToxiko> @DXLelouch24 you wouldn't believe them even after you saw it
[1:37:01] <%Zebroneath> And it's not the streamer's fault either
[1:37:02] <+MGSKomodoDragon> 60 more max health till the mark of the beast
[1:37:02] <%Blank9> it's nuts how fast you get those kind of spoilers, even if you stream to like 12 people total
[1:37:04] <%HotSauceFiend> are fortnite?
[1:37:08] <%HotSauceFiend> like fortnite?
[1:37:08] <Mattais88> Dark Souls
[1:37:09] <+balouie> pokemon fandom is really bad
[1:37:12] <fuji_n2> there's some cool shit that I'd hate to get spoiled in this, but yeah it's spoiler light
[1:37:13] <NiuenSaien> harry potter stans my doode
[1:37:16] <DXLelouch24> well i played it so it doesnt matter thankfully lol
[1:37:16] <ExpressNode> Oh sweet my PS5 cover is coming soon. Got the red one
[1:37:17] <SomeStrangeBroad> spolier alert....the world ends in flame and screaming anquished souls
[1:37:17] <kinkade_77> omori is the worst in years
[1:37:23] <HeroToxiko> fandoms are bad yes
[1:37:24] <DracaenaLeaf> oof
[1:37:25] <+Jiggisnipe> all fandoms are bad all of them
[1:37:26] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Assassin's Creed 3 spoils itself if you look through the memory sequences.
[1:37:27] <%luckysteak> get boots for this
[1:37:28] <Ipsenscastle> LUL
[1:37:29] <%Agami23> i blame homestuck
[1:37:30] <fuji_n2> yeah
[1:37:30] <%Logoth_> Those are the homestuck fan crossovers
[1:37:30] <+TopTieramisu> the tumblr crowd
[1:37:31] <%kyh9> Mother-clones
[1:37:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> preach
[1:37:33] <tattleworm> the homestuck effect
[1:37:34] <%kyh9> Earthbound-clones
[1:37:37] <Zeif00> trueeeee
[1:37:38] <+Grayhammatter> they really do
[1:37:38] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Indie rpgs
[1:37:42] <%zeroarturia> I want 100% this game since I couldn't finish the demon compendium because of a weird bug back when this was released. Now I feel confident enough to go through again in NG Plus.
[1:37:43] <@SoFarFetched> @king_wragles raiding Pat is like the biggest gamble for Woolie. Cause he can just raid Pat and the chat can go "OH NO EMOTE MODE TIME TO SPOIL"
[1:37:43] <+tempestzephyr> undertale was like the worst
[1:37:43] <akitanito> you fucked up
[1:37:44] <%luckysteak> wow
[1:37:44] <%studleydoorite> scum has emotions too :(
[1:37:45] <+pkmamsters> it's the quirkiness. it attracts the widest range of people
[1:37:46] <%Mr_Pylon> Remember Homestuck people?
[1:37:46] <captain_kirkhammer> If that's the armor you picked up from Shovel Knight, putting it on does something iirc
[1:37:46] <%AncelDeLambert> oopsiedoodle
[1:37:48] <fuji_n2> LUL
[1:37:49] <@Fuggins4U> lulz
[1:37:49] <SaltBuster> rip
[1:37:49] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:37:50] <+unhuggable1> indie games were cool in 2012
[1:37:53] <%TheDullaMAN> A lil bit
[1:37:53] <%Logoth_> But the FF14 community is so nice; so its weird
[1:37:55] <%AncelDeLambert> DIIIIIIIIIVE!
[1:37:55] <+balouie> ive still never played undertale because of the fandom
[1:37:55] <%tank7013> Time to climb bitch
[1:37:56] <Paltheos> I'd want to speculate it's because hardcore gamers are attracted to indie games but that's clearly wrong considering Undertale's a megahit.
[1:37:57] <kingra> Did homestuck have a bad fandom?
[1:37:57] <%kyh9> Fans of earthbound and its clones need to be quiet
[1:37:57] <DXLelouch24> ima pirate that Harry Potter game if im assed enough to do so, moral piracy
[1:37:58] <$lotharrio> Yeah but I'm okay, right Pat? HahaSweat
[1:37:59] <$sleepystardewfarmer> I feel like the bigger the fanbase, the more jerks you get always
[1:37:59] <HeroToxiko> tumblr was created because shit fandoms already existed LUL
[1:38:00] <%BigCoffee> Isn't it weird how all of the feel good/emotional/depression games attracts people more toxic then CoD gamers?
[1:38:02] <+NecDW4> But Pat, how will everyone know how much better than them I am if i dont constantly talk about this thing i like in a way that ruins it for everyone?
[1:38:05] <@SoFarFetched> Woolie probably raids and LEAVES right away as he should.
[1:38:06] <Komayeda> spoilers have actively killed dokidoki lit clubs appeal
[1:38:07] <%alphonseisbest> soy boi games attract Soi bois duh
[1:38:09] <%alphonseisbest> :p
[1:38:09] <%AncelDeLambert> HAHAHAHAHA! *Flash Gordon reference*
[1:38:14] <%zeroarturia> @expressnode YO I got the notification too! Can't wait for my covers
[1:38:14] <%spitelite> best ring
[1:38:16] <@ssjklyco> Disney people who work there enjoy going to their place of work on their day off. They are crazy.
[1:38:17] <Paltheos> I don't understand how it works.
[1:38:17] <UnImprest> oh does it look sus fairie? lol
[1:38:17] <%fat_burtreynolds> I want steam just to play noita. Shits so fun
[1:38:19] <fuji_n2> crit builds are crazy
[1:38:21] <%livlinn> Just follow artists. They’re usually chill people
[1:38:23] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @balouie if you avoid literally everything its a neat game with some nice music
[1:38:27] <%SuckerPunchSyd> But i feel ya
[1:38:27] <%fat_burtreynolds> *got steam
[1:38:32] <%AncelDeLambert> and then the BROAD audience has loud assholes
[1:38:36] <+S7R4W83RRY> sucks when a game is good, but you don't wanna talk about it because the fandom is so bad
[1:38:39] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat Why do you not like Octopath?
[1:38:50] <+DenpaDev> COD is casual toxicity, Undertale is poison
[1:38:51] <@ssjklyco> COD attracts bros and 10 year old I feel.
[1:38:53] <%AncelDeLambert> attracts dopamine junkies
[1:38:54] <jfp4life> it's crazy how Max manages to go through all of silent hill 2 with no spolers and then you guys get spoiled as often as you do
[1:38:59] <Ipsenscastle> well put
[1:38:59] <+TopTieramisu> not wrong
[1:38:59] <SomeStrangeBroad> whip it...whip it good
[1:39:00] <fuji_n2> 100%
[1:39:01] <%UvBenServed> There's less to spoil in a CoD map
[1:39:02] <%BigCoffee> Because they take it personally as fuck?
[1:39:02] <%AncelDeLambert> or seratonin, I guess
[1:39:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> kinda like the comfy enforcers
[1:39:08] <+balouie> I should give it a shot
[1:39:08] <SaltBuster> is that a chair???
[1:39:10] <%Logoth_> ?
[1:39:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YEAH
[1:39:11] <Paltheos> Maybe this is why people respond negatively to me when I say Ori and the Blind Forest sucks.
[1:39:11] <SuperGoblinPunch> Overly attached stans
[1:39:12] <Manwad> i member
[1:39:12] <%tank7013> Fucking Ooblets
[1:39:18] <%TheDullaMAN> Shit, gotta charge my headphones.
[1:39:19] <%greasypete00> yep
[1:39:19] <+NecDW4> @PatStaresAt Its the difference between generalized assholery and TARGETED assholery
[1:39:19] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> "NOOOOO! YOU'RE PLANNING IT WRONG! SPOILER! SPOILER!" - every time with those "feels" games...
[1:39:20] <ExpressNode> I don't understand. Never had that mindset
[1:39:20] <%BigCoffee> Yeah I do, but I never played any of those, I don't remember them
[1:39:21] <%notsoy> at least the toxic people in COD are just racist or need anger mgmt instead of being completely unbearable
[1:39:24] <$StrawberryPantsu> That one game uh
[1:39:28] <Enthaarungscreme> The Boyfriend Dungeon stuff
[1:39:28] <Komayeda> so like, no caring vs too much caring
[1:39:28] <%MidnightBurst12> borderline religious vibes
[1:39:30] <+MGSKomodoDragon> walking simulators?
[1:39:31] <fuji_n2> wholesome games 🤢🤮
[1:39:31] <$StrawberryPantsu> Oooblits or whatever
[1:39:32] <DXLelouch24> @jfp4life its because Maxs mods ban on site just a whiff of spoilers, They dont show any mercy
[1:39:32] <%Logoth_> Toby had to turn off comments on his soundtrack youtube videos
[1:39:34] <modsformeandyou> @Paltheos Ori 2 >>> Ori 1
[1:39:37] <UncleMcgoo> I don't get people who make media their entire personality
[1:39:37] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Yeah wholesome game attracting toxic people
[1:39:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> they stilll are smug and real
[1:39:38] <%RealThiele> console wars but emoshuns
[1:39:39] <%LowSkillGod> No one has said a hard slur in chat yet so it could be worse
[1:39:41] <DianaTheAscian> Fuck those weirdos
[1:39:43] <DracaenaLeaf> Wholesomegame's standards was weird
[1:39:45] <akitanito> it's just a cut
[1:39:47] <akitanito> *cult
[1:39:48] <OkamiDude15> shit sucks man
[1:39:49] <+TopTieramisu> hollow knight is my religion :)
[1:39:51] <%Logoth_> What about MLP stans
[1:39:52] <+theoldone001> Are you gonna play the Dark Souls 3 Convergence mod again?
[1:39:54] <%king_wragles> @RealThiele So console wars
[1:39:54] <SaltyAzteca> Cult of the GUN
[1:39:56] <%BigCoffee> Emoshun wars
[1:39:57] <kingra> Parasocial with things that don't exist basically
[1:40:00] <Paltheos> @modsformeandyou It's because the game from AM2R joined the team! (I say for no reason in particular)
[1:40:00] <%tank7013> But yea it's like those people that get super unhealthy attachments to anime characters
[1:40:01] <%FacetiousAF> @theoldone001 yes
[1:40:02] <%notsoy> sanctimonious
[1:40:05] <Paltheos> guy from AM2R*
[1:40:05] <heartlesshealer> moralistic smug?
[1:40:07] <@Fuggins4U> accustomed to?
[1:40:07] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @theoldone001 i think hes doing it on Friday
[1:40:07] <%pectusumbra> You are FAMILIAR with it
[1:40:08] <%AncelDeLambert> CoD toxicity is just sports shit
[1:40:10] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Again
[1:40:11] <Manwad> T pose swimming, kek
[1:40:12] <%pectusumbra> it's the evil you know
[1:40:13] <Ghufufin> competitive toxicity?
[1:40:13] <+Jiggisnipe> it's so extreme that's it's comical
[1:40:13] <%kyh9> Tumblr Puritanism is what I call it
[1:40:16] <%BigCoffee> In CoD you call someone a few slurs, say you'l X their moms, and then move on.
[1:40:17] <artoflec> itss just good ol, classic racism sexism and homophobia yeah
[1:40:18] <%AncelDeLambert> it's just competitiveness
[1:40:19] <$sleepystardewfarmer> cult?
[1:40:19] <%LowSkillGod> raw smugness
[1:40:19] <%Mr_Pylon> Holier than thou toxicity?
[1:40:20] <%zeroarturia> @theoldone001 he is on Friday
[1:40:21] <DracaenaLeaf> cod consist of random insults
[1:40:21] <Enthaarungscreme> Wholesome is entirely passive aggresive
[1:40:21] <HeroToxiko> like stoners pretending rick and morty makes them smart
[1:40:25] <%NopeBadguy> as someone who lives in the bible belt, i feel like comparing it to religious zealotry is a bit much
[1:40:25] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> It's childish on CoD
[1:40:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> COD toxisity is shittalking
[1:40:31] <UncleMcgoo> At least you can mute cod
[1:40:32] <heartlesshealer> oh all the neo-puritanism
[1:40:32] <+unhuggable1> yeah its kind of just numb
[1:40:33] <%alphonseisbest> is there?
[1:40:33] <+MGSKomodoDragon> CoD toxicity derives from competitive nature. Undertale toxicity is something different
[1:40:33] <%BigCoffee> @Enthaarungscreme IT IS!
[1:40:37] <%alphonseisbest> CUCK
[1:40:42] <%blaccbird914> I was just talking about how I missed Cod Lobbies today
[1:40:46] <%AkronymCLT> CoD toxicity is pretty fleeting too
[1:40:49] <kinkade_77> more terminally online people like indie rpgs
[1:40:50] <%AncelDeLambert> Words with a knife
[1:40:50] <+TopTieramisu> SUMMON
[1:40:51] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Theres not a holier than thou type smugness to COD toxicity
[1:40:52] <+unhuggable1> its scary
[1:40:52] <%kyh9> Tumblr Puritans
[1:40:53] <fuji_n2> yeah CoD is childish shit and wholesome games is cringe in a way that's idk
[1:40:53] <%Logoth_> dont forget the voltron fans
[1:40:54] <%tank7013> @NopeBadguy Some of them get REAL bad dude
[1:40:56] <%SmiteKnight> COD toxicity seems very grade school level while wholesome stuff seems very religious, adult, "you should be too old for this" stuff.
[1:40:56] <SaltBuster> it's very predictable and understandable
[1:40:56] <Ghufufin> fanaticism?
[1:40:57] <DianaTheAscian> OH MAN FUCK THE SU PEOPLE
[1:40:58] <+polothegreatest> steven WutFace WutFace
[1:40:59] <%luckysteak> shovel armor has magikarp power
[1:40:59] <Komayeda> yeah, like CoD stuff is just general hatred of being beat at a video game, wholesome stuff fans take things *real* personal.
[1:41:00] <artoflec> where does EVE fit into this where people cut an entire city's power or some shit
[1:41:03] <LilacsandFreedom> Ships are poison, man
[1:41:04] <+Xeno351> it's sort of like a very emotionally immature toxicity in the undertale likes
[1:41:05] <%terry_irvin> someone needs to clip this whole conversation
[1:41:05] <%maskofmichael> Smugness
[1:41:07] <DXLelouch24> so their blind,racist,stupid,and want to cuck your dad
[1:41:07] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt It's that "I'm gonna pray for you" energy that Woolie hates
[1:41:10] <kingra> Oh god that shit
[1:41:12] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:41:13] <%Agami23> cod toxicity comes from a place of anger and anger can go away. wholesome toxicity comes from a place of superiority
[1:41:14] <@commanderclaw> Moral Puritianism for a Fanbase
[1:41:16] <fuji_n2> yup
[1:41:18] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> It's EXACTLY like religion.
[1:41:18] <%NopeBadguy> @tank7013 not saying they dont, i'm saying this is really nothing new to the human experience
[1:41:18] <%Mr_Pylon> This media thing makes me a better person, if you don't consume than you're a worse person by default.
[1:41:18] <+TopTieramisu> sounds like kpop stans
[1:41:19] <heartlesshealer> Harassing people over a fanart that wasn't meant for them AT ALL
[1:41:19] <artoflec> last of us 2 is also like this
[1:41:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> When Undertale fucks go after you they have a "Rightous" anger that makes them WORSE
[1:41:21] <Paltheos> @SuckerPunchSyd The holier than thou shit is from different multiplayer titles, like Overwatch
[1:41:23] <%MidnightBurst12> you can clearly write off the first group as trash and just ignore what they say
[1:41:24] <%MooseIsGoose> Smug is really the only way to describe it. But I think you nailed it  with them just not wanting you to mess with their feelings.
[1:41:27] <%kyh9> Tumblr Puritanism
[1:41:28] <%fat_burtreynolds> obito was the coolest guy
[1:41:29] <DXLelouch24> its not a religion
[1:41:30] <ExpressNode> I think you're losing me here. I don't think I have ever experienced this. Is this something that commonly happens?
[1:41:31] <DXLelouch24> ITS A CULT
[1:41:32] <faldin> there's a weird subset of people that can only interact with media if they can morally ship two characters
[1:41:34] <heartlesshealer> It is VERY personal religion
[1:41:35] <@Jekado> i mean i play video games doesn't that mean i'm automatically evil?
[1:41:35] <zzNamttamzz> Proudly dead inside
[1:41:35] <%tank7013> "If you don't like my favorite serial killer you're literally hitler"
[1:41:37] <%GustauveVIII> yay shovel knight armor power
[1:41:38] <EynoStiles> Which is worst COD or League of legenda
[1:41:39] <Ghufufin> FANaticism?
[1:41:42] <heartlesshealer> religion is cult too
[1:41:42] <Komayeda> cod toxicity is more general than the specific place of these other games
[1:41:45] <@ssjklyco> Saying stuff like that seems counter intuitive to the games message of "just be good to people"
[1:41:46] <OkamiDude15> "all content must be made for MEEEEEEE"
[1:41:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it also kinda feels like "I'm 14 and this is my first time experiencing this type of game"
[1:41:46] <kinkade_77> earthbound is one of my favorite games of all time and i hate undertale
[1:41:47] <KaiserMario> It's SMUG with the GREATEST of EASE
[1:41:47] <$StrawberryPantsu> The Fanbase of Undertale has killed any interest I've had for that game
[1:41:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I think you use Twitter too much LUL
[1:41:49] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @paltheos pfft yeah true
[1:41:50] <+tempestzephyr> the use of social justice terms to make someone else a bad person for not liking what they like
[1:41:51] <+polothegreatest> league
[1:41:52] <crudjandall> Siege toxicity is like a fine wine that causes uncontrollable diarrhea
[1:41:52] <Ipsenscastle> these are the same people who are into musicals, I swear, the two phenomenona are somehow connected
[1:41:54] <%epide> it always feels like those people just lack control in life
[1:41:55] <fuji_n2> those moves are on the archives if need to check em later
[1:41:57] <SaltyAzteca> Omori, more like Olessi Kappa
[1:41:59] <+MGSKomodoDragon> It's their "perfect experience" being muddled with outside perspective?
[1:42:02] <%BigCoffee> It sucks becaue I can't try to introduce Omori or Undertale to friends now because they think it's kiddy shit that only angry dweebs play
[1:42:04] <%alphonseisbest> Didn't in this CHAT RIGH NOW ask u to play Omri?
[1:42:05] <SomeStrangeBroad> i don't get into fandoms
[1:42:07] <%kyh9> There are the same people who REALLY care about what the author's intent is in EVERYTHING
[1:42:08] <Treasure_Vault> Shame, cause Omori looks really cool.
[1:42:12] <Gav_EXE> Would you say the "smuggness" is that bad with the Souls community?
[1:42:15] <cgreene64> Wasn't there a Neo-Nazi pundit that was sharing Omori-Femboy memes?
[1:42:15] <Ghufufin> smells their own farts?
[1:42:16] <%SpookyMooks> sure does make you love the game more right Kappa
[1:42:16] <Sonny_Firestorm> Ironically, in trying to sell the idea that "your choices don't matter" Deltarune managed to fix the overarching problem with Undertale's fandom.
[1:42:17] <%doomunderthestairs> its why fandoms suckkkkkkk
[1:42:17] <%StephanieSadGirl> As much as I hate what the far right has turned this phrase into, those fandoms feel like they are virtue signaling with their extremism.  Like its less about shaming you, and more about proving themselves to others.
[1:42:17] <+Jiggisnipe> it also helps that the COD toxicity is explicitly when you play COD, other fandoms it happens on reddit or twitter or youtube
[1:42:18] <%shurtal> GOTTA CLUTCH THEM PEARLS
[1:42:19] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Oh fuck, an actual JoJo reference?
[1:42:20] <%AncelDeLambert> it's so DEEP, you guys. Do you understand how DEEP this game is? I do, I'm DEEP.
[1:42:21] <%greasypete00> my sadness is better than your sadness
[1:42:22] <Zombrocom> Oh, I missed the omori stream, sounds like it went poorly?
[1:42:25] <EynoStiles> they are mad you dont share they're hype
[1:42:26] <SaltBuster> is there a really bad Omori fan base? I was looking to see into that game later
[1:42:29] <KenzBurp> the puritanical assholes will like, dox you and like, find your family on social media and send them death threats
[1:42:32] <%NopeBadguy> i never cared for undertale tbh
[1:42:32] <@Fuggins4U> enjoy the media, ignore the audience, that's usually what I try to do
[1:42:37] <@ssjklyco> You know what is the best wholesome game is? Katamari Damacy
[1:42:37] <%doomunderthestairs> the games/content itself is fantastic just not the overzealous fans
[1:42:39] <+TopTieramisu> are you saying that undertale is the rick and morty of games?
[1:42:39] <%Blank9> might be like thinking about malding raiders in ff14
[1:42:41] <kingra> It's bacause they're great that it attracts those types of people
[1:42:42] <DXLelouch24> Pat you just need to overwrite what you learned about Omori with new shit until you forgoet then play it again
[1:42:43] <fuji_n2> I legit stay away of these games cause of their fanbases
[1:42:44] <%fat_burtreynolds> Tumbler warriors?
[1:42:44] <%RealThiele> only the penitent man shall pass
[1:42:44] <DXLelouch24> works for me
[1:42:47] <%notsoy> shitty people ruining the experience with what is a great thing in a vacuum is very weird, and a tragedy
[1:42:48] <Enthaarungscreme> I never think about fanbases anymore, I am happy
[1:42:48] <%LowSkillGod> @EynoStiles I was once told in league that i had a fatass's item build and ive never heard something that creative in COD
[1:42:52] <+Pars_Librum> @PatStaresAt The problem is, and always will be, when people make a piece of media into a facet of their personality and life
[1:42:55] <%BigCoffee> I'm waiting for the switch release to get it
[1:42:55] <%alphonseisbest> Didn't people in this chat RN ASK u to play Omri?!
[1:42:57] <%alphonseisbest> also yes
[1:43:00] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> So you play games off stream, @PatStaresAt ?
[1:43:00] <%Blank9> sneak it up on people like woolie
[1:43:01] <OkamiDude15> @Zombrocom someone during the podcast spoiled it for him in chat
[1:43:04] <fuji_n2> yup
[1:43:06] <+polothegreatest> "hey play this game, just don google it"LUL
[1:43:07] <%kyh9> It's not a coincidence that these same "Wholesome" puritans are the same people who treat game narratives as direct advocations of the creators
[1:43:09] <+Xeno351> i mean those games are very broadly popular as well, it's probably a vocal minority
[1:43:09] <Ghufufin> parasocial relations are weird and a  bitch
[1:43:11] <artoflec> ive only had positive experiences with Earthbound which is funny and makes me more confused where the comparisons are elaSmile
[1:43:11] <hollumdusk> Oh, I can't find interest on playing Undertale, now that I know all about the plot. Deltarune is still safe for me.
[1:43:14] <%TheDullaMAN> Oops, All Mystery Games!
[1:43:17] <Zombrocom> @OkamiDude15 Oh thats fucked
[1:43:20] <%Agami23> its the type of smugness that makes them go "well my game is perfect, how dare you think its not!"
[1:43:21] <%fat_burtreynolds> Damn
[1:43:26] <%NopeBadguy> idk it sounds chill
[1:43:26] <%AncelDeLambert> man, that first day of Kingmaker was a BAD idea to tweet through
[1:43:27] <arkv01> shut up pat PLAY IT
[1:43:30] <%MidnightBurst12> when do we get to the point where video games are just a net negative?
[1:43:31] <Reisadan> challenge accepted?
[1:43:32] <@SoFarFetched> @alphonseisbest not surprising as chat doesn't really look at his schedule geefO and keep asking him "what are you gonna play tomorrow?"
[1:43:33] <+croutonian> Woolie said the same thing for watching TV shows right? lol
[1:43:34] <%NopeBadguy> did you ever get back to stories 2 off stream?
[1:43:35] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Or play on day minus 14 like DMC 5
[1:43:35] <kingra> Is Pathfinder DND shit?
[1:43:35] <%AncelDeLambert> ... are they?
[1:43:37] <vile_brand> i liked your pillars streams
[1:43:37] <+balouie> the pathfinder games are really good
[1:43:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Cod fandom is shittalking obnoxious nonsense that actually gets better when you join in. Undertail fandom toxicity is serious psychotic nonsense that comes from people who think they can do no wrong
[1:43:37] <%fat_burtreynolds> Job hazards
[1:43:37] <%greasypete00> I feel like a sizeable amount of your audience would watch it
[1:43:37] <MaesePC> @PatStaresAt I watched your POE streams!!!
[1:43:37] <UnImprest> shit i got like hundred ours in that
[1:43:37] <%Order_of_Mystery> did you vassalize the kobolds, Pat?
[1:43:40] <Komayeda> did they find the path yet?
[1:43:41] <%BigCoffee> I would watch it, but fuck no play that on your time.
[1:43:41] <Zombrocom> I would watch kingmaker, but I loved that game so LUL
[1:43:42] <DXLelouch24> thats a podcast game, not a stream game
[1:43:43] <%terry_irvin> facts that shit sucks
[1:43:44] <retconrecon> they even spoiled Peaches LP of UT
[1:43:45] <fuji_n2> believe me
[1:43:45] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> I'd watch the fuck outta that, dude. But I'm kind of a piece of shit
[1:43:45] <@Fuggins4U> play Mario Kart
[1:43:47] <%Logoth_> Like 200 people would show up for pathfinder
[1:43:48] <captain_kirkhammer> Do a pre-recorded for youtube then
[1:43:49] <%AncelDeLambert> Kingmaker is like $9 on sale, I wouldn't call that popular
[1:43:51] <HeroToxiko> @MidnightBurst12 1997
[1:43:52] <+balouie> i love the crusader kings 3 game but probably horrible to stream
[1:43:53] <%NopeBadguy> you thought that about endwalker too tbf
[1:43:53] <+ALazo> I would totally show up for a pathfinder stream
[1:43:54] <%terry_irvin> i won't gonna be honest
[1:43:54] <$StrawberryPantsu> Watching Pathfinder sounds like Poison
[1:43:54] <fuji_n2> I would, believe me Kappa
[1:43:55] <%StephanieSadGirl> Am I alone in actually wanting to try and DM Pat in an actual TTRPG?
[1:43:56] <%za7az> I would totally show up!
[1:43:59] <UnImprest> I would Patsama
[1:43:59] <%Agami23> dude i'd totally show up to a pillars of eternity stream, what you talking about?
[1:44:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> though, I WOULD show up for 7 hours of monhun grinding
[1:44:00] <ExpressNode> I might show up and then leave gonna be honest there
[1:44:01] <%luckysteak> dont forget your cool chain lightning!
[1:44:02] <+NecDW4> @kyh9 OMG, the bad guy was a Nazi?!?!? THAT MEANS YOU SUPPORT WHITE SUPREMACY! *sigh* those fucking people
[1:44:03] <EynoStiles> @agami23 How dare you not believe in my thing, your going to hell. is the sentiment i feel
[1:44:03] <%greasypete00> I mean I showed up to this stream gottem
[1:44:05] <DianaTheAscian> I show up no matter what game (unless I want to play it myself)
[1:44:06] <%AncelDeLambert> did he what the what?
[1:44:07] <%AyotoCorp> I would totally show up for a Pathfinder Warth of the Righteous stream
[1:44:08] <Zombrocom> At least 200 people would come to that kingmaker/WOTR stream
[1:44:09] <Enthaarungscreme> I wouldn't show up
[1:44:09] <+Xeno351> i would be lying if I said that
[1:44:10] <$lotharrio> Well... not for all of it. It's like 80+ hours
[1:44:11] <%Order_of_Mystery> :D
[1:44:11] <%MooseIsGoose> I am going to say I will show up and then just actually not pay attention I find this to be a happy middle ground
[1:44:12] <%ElkRiverDog> I would if I needed something to fall asleep to
[1:44:15] <FlashFrame> People showed up for KOTOR, same shit... it's an RPG where your decisions are what matter. Of course people would watch.
[1:44:15] <SirNewton2> that game is good but yeah its a long boring game overall
[1:44:17] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> I love crpgs
[1:44:20] <kingra> Kolbolds <3
[1:44:20] <heartlesshealer> I will if you're talking with Paige through the whole Pathfinder stream, but yeah you're right
[1:44:21] <alroy909> I would but that's because I'm a big pathfinder nerd
[1:44:22] <%Order_of_Mystery> fuck them trolls
[1:44:25] <@commanderclaw> Yeaaaah, the trolls are fucking assholes
[1:44:26] <@Fuggins4U> you know you got the shovel shard, right?
[1:44:27] <Zombrocom> Oh shame
[1:44:32] <lloyddboy> you covered the kobolds in vaseline???
[1:44:34] <%pectusumbra> yeah that's fari
[1:44:34] <Manwad> hehe dorf fort
[1:44:36] <+tempestzephyr> a little genocide, as a treat
[1:44:38] <DXLelouch24> Troll GENOCIDE
[1:44:39] <SaltyAzteca> That sounds...horrid
[1:44:40] <%AncelDeLambert> trolls are almost impossible to kill, so fuck keeping them around
[1:44:44] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Dip them in Vaseline
[1:44:44] <%SmiteKnight> Did you have any trouble with the last boss in the troll dungeon?
[1:44:45] <Zombrocom> You can only vassalize them if you alignment is chaotic
[1:44:45] <$lotharrio> You weren't in for making the monsters who refer to you as "meat" into your allies/subjects?
[1:44:46] <Reisadan> bloodstained is too mainstream; TRUE gamers play Deedlit /animeglasses *snort*
[1:44:46] <KaiserMario> Vaseline the Trolls?
[1:44:47] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Lets goooo
[1:44:47] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> You mean you'd lube them up?
[1:44:48] <%LowSkillGod> !KOBOLDS ENSLAVED!
[1:44:50] <MilleniaAntares> Why is Shovel Knight in this game?
[1:44:50] <Ghufufin> try out shovel shard?
[1:44:50] <@SoFarFetched> Honestly the Kingmaker stream would be TOO toxic/backseaty , because people would talk to Pat about his stats/choices. I mean look what happened on twitter when he BARELY posted his stats.
[1:44:51] <hexen109> it's when you use vasiline
[1:44:51] <FassieFons> pat says kobold rights
[1:44:52] <Gav_EXE> Vassalize them with the soil. LUL
[1:44:52] <fuji_n2> shovel shard Pog
[1:44:53] <%SmiteKnight> Cause that gave me some serious issues.
[1:44:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> Also they nonstop sing the trolololollol song
[1:44:57] <Zombrocom> Overwise you just kill/banish them
[1:45:01] <%StephanieSadGirl> Dwarves can be pretty racist in most fantasy...
[1:45:01] <%fat_burtreynolds> They’re eating her
[1:45:03] <%epide> no to make them vascles is to make them serve you
[1:45:04] <+NecDW4> Just rub those trols with vaseline
[1:45:06] <@Fuggins4U> FOR SHOVELRY
[1:45:06] <arkv01> I want shovel knight in the new armored core
[1:45:07] <%BigCoffee> Hey Pat, whenever you finish Kingmaker someday, I think you might enjoy checking out the written pen and paper books and see the core adventure. It's very very itneresting to see what they build up on, what they cut or added.
[1:45:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> This was the start of kickstarter games
[1:45:08] <$StrawberryPantsu> Backer Reward
[1:45:08] <%fat_burtreynolds> And now they’re gonna eat me
[1:45:10] <kingra> Shovel Knight is PogChamp
[1:45:10] <Paltheos> Shovel Knight is p. good.
[1:45:13] <Komayeda> If Shovel Knight can be in Yooka Laylee, he can be here too
[1:45:14] <%fat_burtreynolds> Ohhhh maaah gaaaaaed
[1:45:14] <+tempestzephyr> shovelknight everywhere system
[1:45:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> before Mighty Number 9 KILLED it
[1:45:18] <%tank7013> Shovel Knight is like The Baz he's in fucking everything
[1:45:18] <SaltyAzteca> I should probably finish that...
[1:45:19] <%Logoth_> When are we getting a Shovel Knight jRPG
[1:45:19] <+Grayhammatter> shovel knight does rule
[1:45:20] <+MGSKomodoDragon> In 1920, 8 year old Samuel Reshevsky played chess with several chess masters at once. He lost every single game.
[1:45:20] <HeroToxiko> shovel knight is fucking sick
[1:45:21] <akitanito> shovel knight everywhere system
[1:45:23] <%notsoy> shovel knight is in everything by now anyway
[1:45:24] <%doomunderthestairs> I love that Shovel Knight is just in so many different games
[1:45:24] <+Dracoshroob> i remember each time i play through this i have to look up how to swim because i always forget which monster gives it
[1:45:24] <DXLelouch24> i still need to play King of Cards
[1:45:25] <ExpressNode> Haven't touched it in years. Probably 3
[1:45:27] <%Agami23> i love how shovel knight looks like a human in every other game he is in, but in shovel knight he is a little manlet
[1:45:28] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @tempestzephyr god damnit beat me to it
[1:45:29] <%FacetiousAF> pat if you were to stream a shovel knight which would it be?
[1:45:30] <Gav_EXE> Yeah, Shovel Knight, from Smash Bros. Kappa
[1:45:31] <%pectusumbra> you'll have to come back for this one later
[1:45:33] <%studleydoorite> scrape me daddy
[1:45:33] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Shovel Knight is pretty cool, I GUESS bffShiggy
[1:45:34] <%luckysteak> can't scrape properly without stuff from later
[1:45:39] <%StephanieSadGirl> The question isnt 'why is shovelknight in this game' the question is 'why isn't the Baz in this game?'
[1:45:39] <%epide> pat how do you feel about the camra in king maker?
[1:45:39] <%pectusumbra> to fill the map for this zone
[1:45:41] <%Leonnald> Leonnald subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! I wouldn't watch a stream like that Pat, sounds great to play, terrible to watch.
[1:45:42] <%Valdorick> Honestly, Storybased CRPGs just seem like Stream poison. Since you're not going to get people who want to experience the story on their own, you're just going to get the people who want you to "play the game right". Do the quests like they did, make your character like they did, pick the options they did...
[1:45:42] <fuji_n2> you'll need to backtrack anyway
[1:45:44] <%BlueLunecy> When playing an indie game always assume Shovel Knight will show up until proven otherwise
[1:45:45] <%MelBrooksKA> Is Baz in this game?
[1:45:53] <+AngryPhant0m> is he going to play PC Rise?
[1:45:57] <Enthaarungscreme> It's fine to have some blank spots on the map
[1:45:59] <%StephanieSadGirl> @MelBrooksKA exactly
[1:46:00] <MattGetsGood> Did you just get shovel armor?
[1:46:02] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> NONE
[1:46:03] <%TheDullaMAN> Try it
[1:46:04] <Zombrocom> A MASSIVE amount actually to be honest
[1:46:06] <FullMetalSnorlax> You will want to get all of teh shovel knight drops, or a t least one of them in particualr
[1:46:07] <HeroToxiko> i bought shovelknight twice in 2015 and got every expansion free just because, love that dev team
[1:46:14] <lloyddboy> moment to Kreygasm ment
[1:46:15] <$lotharrio> The moment to moment is mostly the same.
[1:46:17] <%LowSkillGod> @MelBrooksKA hes a mask you can wear
[1:46:20] <SaltBuster> Schrodingers Shovel knight @bluelunecy
[1:46:20] <+Pars_Librum> @Valdorick Absolutely, people get real weird about that. You attract the min/maxing crowd.
[1:46:22] <zzNamttamzz> @angryphant0m he got it 3 weeks early
[1:46:27] <%luckysteak> goblin ring@
[1:46:28] <@SoFarFetched> @Valdorick  like Dark souls streams psaSmug
[1:46:29] <fuji_n2> that's a good ring
[1:46:32] <Mattais88> Boss ring
[1:46:35] <@commanderclaw> The only thing that changes in moment to moment is your options for management
[1:46:36] <Ghufufin> @patstaresat alignment  affects companions the most
[1:46:38] <Zombrocom> The core storyline is going to be the same sure, but the results of quests and kingdom shit would be pretty different
[1:46:38] <+Grayhammatter> that's a great ring
[1:46:42] <+balouie> i think wrath of the righteous is better about the difference
[1:46:42] <%RealThiele> yeyeye
[1:46:42] <Paltheos> Oh shit, the "Completionist Player's Ring" Love those in these games
[1:46:43] <%SmiteKnight> Oh hell yes it is.
[1:46:47] <%BigCoffee> Wrath is also 50-80 hours shorter because the useless fat is gone.
[1:46:49] <@commanderclaw> WotR is fucking nuts. There's *so* many different paths
[1:46:50] <sirrice77> WoTR is also buggy, unless they fixed it
[1:46:50] <%Valdorick> @SoFarFetched psaSmug
[1:46:51] <$lotharrio> Less story party members overall, but you get more money so you can hire mercenaries.
[1:46:52] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> YEah, the party memebers don't add much outside of their questlines, so I doubt the moment to moment would be much diffrent
[1:46:53] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Shovel Knight helped a lot of indie devs embrace crowdfunding so the cameos are a tip of the hat
[1:46:53] <%shurtal> CoD now has an Attack on Titan crossover!?!?!?!
[1:46:54] <+balouie> yeah
[1:46:54] <DXLelouch24> wont skip to sequel huh Pat? isnt that a Mindgoblin?
[1:46:57] <Ghufufin> not directly
[1:46:59] <%notsoy> yes, in both PF games
[1:46:59] <%AncelDeLambert> WotR has great mythic paths and FUCK me ever playing any of them considering how buggy that game is and how long it takes to get to them
[1:47:02] <%SmiteKnight> There's like five or six different path splits in Wrath that completely change the story in huge ways.
[1:47:02] <%BigCoffee> Super evil companions won't want to fuck around with mister goody 2 shoes
[1:47:03] <+AngryPhant0m> @zzNamttamzz thats unfair.....but okay
[1:47:10] <%NopeBadguy> companions of your alignment are more likely to be better advisors iirc
[1:47:15] <%BigCoffee> You have compatible people
[1:47:17] <modsformeandyou> When will Elden Ring spoilers start to come out? I have to get off the internet during that time
[1:47:22] <%AyotoCorp> I've gone through Wrath like 3 and a half times total and it's wildly different each time
[1:47:22] <PainterOfMiniatures> That's probably in WotR
[1:47:23] <Zombrocom> Not like you alingment directly, but the alignment choices can change where they end up
[1:47:25] <@commanderclaw> In WotR, you can't say, play as a Lich and hang out with Paladins
[1:47:26] <Manwad> yeah i was pragmatic in the beginning of kingmaker and the lil gnome lady said "fuck that"
[1:47:30] <%AncelDeLambert> I wanted to eventually play a Lich Dragon Disciple into Swarm That Walks but I will NOT replay another fifty hours or more to get there
[1:47:32] <%SmiteKnight> Wrath has a path where you can go it 100% alone if you want to. and EVERYONE fucks off.
[1:47:42] <acornturtle1> pat, there is a YouTuber (strat-edgy) who put out a really good review about Pathfinder that might have some helpful tips and ideas
[1:47:45] <%pectusumbra> I think the whole script for that game already leaked or something
[1:47:52] <$lotharrio> Evil guys will stick with you because they don't care as much.
[1:47:54] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @modsformeandyou As soon as the game files are available for people to mine through.
[1:47:55] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Call of Duty and Attack on Titan...
[1:47:56] <DXLelouch24> Elden Ring spoilers will be complete gibberish anyways, like all Souls games
[1:47:59] <@Fuggins4U> sorbet
[1:48:03] <DXLelouch24> without context
[1:48:06] <%BigCoffee> @SmiteKnight The "I'm gonna do this war my myself, with blackjack and hookers" path
[1:48:06] <Gav_EXE> Red ice cream. monkaS
[1:48:13] <%zarkazeon> there's a chest in that tall room you might have missed
[1:48:15] <%fat_burtreynolds> Yum
[1:48:16] <+Pars_Librum> @AncelDeLambert That's my main problem with it. You have all these cool option but you have to put hours upon hours into it to try them all.
[1:48:19] <@commanderclaw> NOOOOO
[1:48:22] <Zombrocom> And some advisors are locked behind alignment choices and such
[1:48:25] <captain_kirkhammer> @modsformeandyou They already are finding shit, which may or may not be in the game
[1:48:25] <jetstreamlove_R> Better than actual Castlevania, you get to play a waifu
[1:48:26] <@commanderclaw> WotR is fucking *long*
[1:48:28] <%SmiteKnight> Whoever said Wrath is shorter is WRONG.
[1:48:30] <HeroToxiko> i kinda like how cod released a platform that they just keep releasing the cod's onto instead of repeatedly selling disks, hate the company and all but damn thats neat
[1:48:37] <Zombrocom> WOTR is pretty massive
[1:48:39] <%AncelDeLambert> WotR is long as fuck
[1:48:39] <%AyotoCorp> woolieONEGUY
[1:48:42] <+balouie> yeah wrath is  long
[1:48:45] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt My impression of WotR is that it is WAY more replayable
[1:48:46] <+Pars_Librum> Wrath is massive
[1:48:46] <%MooseIsGoose> I already have what I want to do in my next playthrough for Wrath
[1:48:48] <@commanderclaw> I've got 124 hours and I'm at Chapter 5 of 6
[1:48:50] <DXLelouch24> @captain_kirkhammer no ittl be in, wether base game, dlc, or a mod
[1:48:52] <DXLelouch24> BET
[1:48:56] <%pectusumbra> god this dumb room
[1:48:56] <%BigCoffee> Wrath is also the most high stakes DnD adventure ever made, or like top 3-5. It's so balls of the wall it's great
[1:48:56] <Ghufufin> @PatStaresAt  i would say wrath is less meandering
[1:48:58] <Zombrocom> A TON
[1:48:59] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt A TON
[1:49:00] <%SmiteKnight> Depends on the path.
[1:49:00] <%notsoy> a LOT
[1:49:03] <%AncelDeLambert> I have 263 hours on my Steam account for WotR... I am halfway through the campaign
[1:49:03] <chowndawg> Kingmaker is just really long
[1:49:04] <+balouie> a lot sometimes
[1:49:04] <@commanderclaw> Angel Versus Lich is a huge difference
[1:49:04] <%BigCoffee> Depends on the path
[1:49:05] <%AyotoCorp> A shitton
[1:49:07] <Zombrocom> Shockingly a lot
[1:49:08] <DXLelouch24> souls community is crazy
[1:49:09] <%AyotoCorp> 75%?
[1:49:11] <Gav_EXE> Inscryption%
[1:49:11] <%LowSkillGod> is all of this about FFXiV?
[1:49:11] <%BigCoffee> 2 of them change the game entirely
[1:49:13] <$lotharrio> I've been told it's about 33%
[1:49:13] <@commanderclaw> Uh, 40-60%?
[1:49:14] <+unhuggable1> percentage of what
[1:49:16] <fuji_n2> 99% Kappa
[1:49:19] <hexen109> depending on path it's 100%
[1:49:21] <%notsoy> some mythic paths will cost you all of your companions
[1:49:22] <%SmiteKnight> Some paths are very similar, some paths completely change it. Like 80-90% difference.
[1:49:23] <+Tucker0603> fucking lot%
[1:49:23] <%AncelDeLambert> admittedly, about a hundred of those hours are trying to make a character that doesn't die immediately
[1:49:25] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt Don't have that, I'm early on and already seeing BIG shit
[1:49:26] <Zombrocom> Depends on which path
[1:49:28] <%notsoy> or let you access different ones
[1:49:29] <+PrincessLuna85> @PatStaresAt more than youd expect but less than youd hope %
[1:49:31] <sirrice77> All i know is certain mythic paths like make people leave for good, and many choices are locked behind paths
[1:49:32] <+balouie> it matters on the path some its completely different
[1:49:38] <%luckysteak> this is where I grinded out the dullahammmer soul
[1:49:45] <%luckysteak> really good at max level
[1:49:45] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:49:47] <%SmiteKnight> And there's like...what....10-12 paths?
[1:49:47] <%AgniBrandt> Though I have read up on it a bit
[1:49:49] <akitanito> I forgot, are there medusa heads in bloodstained?
[1:49:52] <%zarkazeon> chest in that tall room a few back you missed pat.
[1:49:57] <%BigCoffee> 3-4 paths are about the same-ish, 2 change the game entirely, and 3 others I have no idea yet, but I know one has consequences that are also cool
[1:49:59] <Zombrocom> 9 paths I think
[1:50:01] <SaltBuster> welcome to the Buer Zone
[1:50:05] <Profmcstevie> it DO go up
[1:50:05] <%TheDullaMAN> These are them
[1:50:11] <+rafaelba93> you sure ?
[1:50:12] <%Valdorick> He's fighting them RIGHT NOW
[1:50:14] <%pectusumbra> you have to loop around to get back to that waterfall room
[1:50:14] <%TheDullaMAN> Dullahans are cool
[1:50:15] <%AyotoCorp> 10 paths
[1:50:16] <%MelBrooksKA> @PatStaresAt Is mayo a percentage?
[1:50:16] <%SharkMissile> Pat, you've convinced me to try Kingmaker, I'm glad you're enjoying it! :)
[1:50:17] <+NecDW4> @pat, you FARM THOSE FLOATING HEADS! Theyre the BEST soul shard
[1:50:18] <$lotharrio> Dullahan Head shard is overpowered. Try it out.
[1:50:20] <fuji_n2> need time stop dude
[1:50:21] <@SoFarFetched> chat blind confirmed geefBlind
[1:50:27] <akitanito> I mean the ones that petrify you on touch
[1:50:28] <%BigCoffee> No patrick
[1:50:30] <@SoFarFetched> "IS MIRIAM IN THIS GAME???"
[1:50:32] <@Jekado> @TheDullaMAN i feel like there is some bias there...
[1:50:34] <%luckysteak> no, mayo is not a percentage
[1:50:35] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt spongebob ref
[1:50:37] <%BigCoffee> It's a spongebob gag
[1:50:39] <captain_kirkhammer> Spongebob reference
[1:50:39] <Paltheos> Hey, I'll still take these over the Medusa Heads in the clocktowers in some of the classic games which would just chain petrify you.
[1:50:39] <%TheDullaMAN> Spongebob joke
[1:50:40] <artoflec> you know a like a speedrun Mayo%
[1:50:42] <%luckysteak> horseradish is not a percentage eiether
[1:50:44] <%pokefan9956> @PatStaresAt its a spongebob ref
[1:50:48] <SaltyAzteca> Horseradish is not a percentage either
[1:50:52] <ThatGuyThere03> who in the right mind likes mayo
[1:50:52] <%SharkMissile> D:
[1:50:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt No patrick mayo is not a percentage
[1:50:53] <%MelBrooksKA> @SoFarFetched Who said that!?
[1:50:54] <SirNewton2> have you gotten to the train yet?
[1:50:58] <clloudberry> kill the dullahan heads, their shard is really good
[1:51:03] <%zarkazeon> ahh srry my b.
[1:51:06] <artoflec> what about SPICY mayo 👌
[1:51:07] <Paltheos> Shortcuts jphPog
[1:51:07] <%maskofmichael> mayonnaise is good
[1:51:09] <%Agami23> is nachos a cereal?
[1:51:10] <%SmiteKnight> There's a path in Wrath that you would probably love a lot, Pat. Like, a serious game change up and something I'd expect out of an actual tabletop game.
[1:51:13] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it's all about the Aioli
[1:51:14] <DXLelouch24> Pat do you hate mustard or has Paige made you like it by proxy?
[1:51:14] <$ImExtremelyManly> do you just eat dry sandwiches then
[1:51:14] <%pokefan9956> battle for bikini bottom stream when
[1:51:15] <%Ironbuttz> then whay is your condiment of choice Pat?
[1:51:16] <@SoFarFetched> @MelBrooksKA your mom did psaDab
[1:51:16] <ExpressNode> I mean it can be a percentage. A percentage of the shit that will clog your arteries.
[1:51:18] <%MelBrooksKA> I'm not a fan of mayo either
[1:51:20] <Komayeda> it all comes full circle!
[1:51:29] <%fat_burtreynolds> How bout a Edward 40 hands?
[1:51:34] <Paltheos> @maskofmichael Contextual. Mayo as a condiment sucks. It can work as an ingredient sometimes though. It's great in deviled eggs.
[1:51:38] <%SharkMissile> Is the orb an instrument?
[1:51:43] <$sleepystardewfarmer> what about like aoili? like cilantro aoili?
[1:51:46] <%MelBrooksKA> @SoFarFetched But she's dead csbeastRage
[1:51:49] <%StephanieSadGirl> So I have a question, if jazz in starwars is called jizz, does that cause jizz in star wars to be called jazz?
[1:51:52] <fuji_n2> cant believe Mirian of bloodstained is in the game Kappa
[1:51:57] <+AlucardX60> You might be able to get more books from OD too.
[1:51:57] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It's true, if Pat had the option of a plate of shit VS a plat of shit covered in Mayo, he prefers the Raw Shit. We have the receipts
[1:51:58] <%FacetiousAF> mm blood pool
[1:52:01] <%Bt_Robot> TIME STOP
[1:52:01] <%BigCoffee> @Paltheos I like it on burgers but I also need mustard to balance it
[1:52:02] <+hush_wolf> what that smell.... it's blooodd
[1:52:03] <MattGetsGood> @patstaresat I think you picked up a armour and didn’t check it
[1:52:12] <@SoFarFetched> @MelBrooksKA look her  ghost just HAD to ask geefDense
[1:52:16] <fuji_n2> time stop for the blood pool
[1:52:22] <PainterOfMiniatures> The shovel kniight shard dropped
[1:52:24] <%doomunderthestairs> mayo is ok
[1:52:24] <SaltBuster> is that where the bloodstained is?
[1:52:27] <modsformeandyou> What does Pat think of RE Village?
[1:52:28] <%notsoy> there was the shovel shard too
[1:52:30] <akitanito> he got the shovel armor summon
[1:52:34] <HeroToxiko> yeye
[1:52:37] <captain_kirkhammer> i think he wants you to wear it? maybe it does something?
[1:52:39] <%StephanieSadGirl> WTF was that enemy?  Was that a lying figure?!
[1:52:41] <%MelBrooksKA> @SoFarFetched Jokes on you, I lied
[1:52:51] <Paltheos> lol summoned right past that dude
[1:52:51] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:52:54] <@SoFarFetched> @MelBrooksKA Im gonna tell your mom on you geefPoint
[1:52:54] <artoflec> LUL
[1:52:55] <Ipsenscastle> @StephanieSadGirl the words jizz and jazz originally meant the same thing anyway. Our real life jazz music IS ALREADY JIZZ MUSIC
[1:52:56] <quintorro> why is all this music so good?
[1:52:58] <akitanito> need flat ground
[1:52:59] <artoflec> hes doing his best
[1:52:59] <$ImExtremelyManly> good job shovel knight
[1:53:02] <%luckysteak> shovel armor hits more often the more shards you have
[1:53:08] <%Valdorick> Huh, I thought the shovel knight shard was something else...
[1:53:08] <artoflec> hes tired Pat he has to guest star in like 20 other games
[1:53:11] <captain_kirkhammer> You could have used that candle for height and gotten up there
[1:53:12] <fuji_n2> lvl it up later, also there's cooler shovel stuff
[1:53:17] <HeroToxiko> Dig the fuckin earth
[1:53:18] <+Grayhammatter> prolly better if he's upgraded, but idk
[1:53:20] <SaltBuster> arise kickstarters!
[1:53:22] <FullMetalSnorlax> every time you summon shovel armour, there is a chance he will be giant screen clear

[2:02:27] <@Fuggins4U> Crypto Island was hit by an NFTornado
[2:02:27] <marsnbars> it would definitely make sense
[2:02:29] <Ipsenscastle> nuke the blockchain
[2:02:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> Fyre fest was hilarious
[2:02:34] <DXLelouch24> is Ja Rule funding it?
[2:02:36] <%doomunderthestairs> lets hope
[2:02:37] <Profmcstevie> A tragic cringe attack killed the entire islands populace....pity
[2:02:38] <+DenpaDev> Atlantis was the first crypto country
[2:02:39] <%Maids4lyfe> @DXLelouch24 did you see them say "mental age is what matters" or whatever?
[2:02:40] <%StephanieSadGirl> @Bane_Kaikyo crypto people are trying to make a literal Bioshock Rapture island.
[2:02:40] <+rasend0ri> Konami NFT’s on Castlevania 35 anniversary. Please kill me GoD!!!!
[2:02:41] <%Mr_Pylon> The crypto military will have to defend them from pirates
[2:02:42] <chhdez> No no no, not something bad to happen, but something incredibly embarrassing
[2:02:42] <%cooldude69xx> If 90% of them get Covid, what the fuck are they gonna do?
[2:02:49] <Komayeda> Aw man, remember the whole "Mental Maturity" tweet they put out?
[2:02:51] <@Fuggins4U> death by volcano is baaaaad
[2:02:51] <Paltheos> I'd also ask how you managed to do that
[2:02:52] <lloyddboy> can't WAIT for all the billionaires to fuck off to Hellstar Remina
[2:02:53] <DXLelouch24> @Maids4lyfe yes thats the joke
[2:02:54] <@ssjklyco> Can't wait for the NFT dating sites to show up.  call it " NFT Lovechain"
[2:02:55] <%justcallmebobplease> Ginger seeking volcanoes.
[2:02:55] <OkamiDude15> "sir this isnt a ticket to the island its a print out of the page saying you bought a reciept"
[2:02:58] <captain_kirkhammer> yes
[2:02:59] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yes
[2:02:59] <$Emperor_Machinus> can Crypto island be bikini Atoll?
[2:03:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat if you fall into a valcanio I think I'll blame paige
[2:03:00] <akitanito> why would you fall into a volcano in the first place
[2:03:00] <%StephanieSadGirl> Remember when someone asked the crypto island people what the age of consent was and they said 'as long as they are smart enoguh to consent'
[2:03:02] <%cooldude69xx> What if the island IS volcanically active? Did they even check?
[2:03:04] <fuji_n2> nah under green room
[2:03:05] <$ImExtremelyManly> ya
[2:03:06] <Paltheos> Although if it's any consolation it's... probably a pretty quick death
[2:03:06] <%notsoy> it would be crazy you were outside for long enough to fall into a volcano
[2:03:08] <ComfyFox> the one below the travel room
[2:03:15] <%Bt_Robot> How many dudes does Ja Rule have to blow for Crypto Island to become real?
[2:03:16] <+rasend0ri> Under the warp
[2:03:20] <fuji_n2> under travel room
[2:03:21] <Parapattern> Everyone will get cholera on Crypto Island
[2:03:23] <%SharkMissile> What if it explodes but somehow blows you to safety
[2:03:25] <captain_kirkhammer> No, it's directly under the warp point, I think you passed it three tinmes
[2:03:33] <vile_brand> the dantalion shard is great
[2:03:33] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Odie's room? Is this connected to gorfield?
[2:03:35] <%luckysteak> POWER
[2:03:39] <%kainhighwind1990> Any FF14 people here see that pic of the reaper that had a /say macro that said "Waxing Slice" every time they used Waxing Slice?
[2:03:39] <%cooldude69xx> @ssjklyco "Nah babe, it's cool. I bought the condom on the blockchain"
[2:03:41] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Um, was Crypto Island not a parody, or am I being dumb?
[2:03:41] <%BigCoffee> Oh no backer paintings!
[2:03:45] <$ImExtremelyManly> under warp sorry i mistook it for save point
[2:03:55] <%justcallmebobplease> KILL THE BACKERS
[2:03:55] <Komayeda> It'll be like Epstiens Island but actively advertised as such
[2:03:56] <%FacetiousAF> more left?
[2:04:02] <captain_kirkhammer> under warp room
[2:04:03] <fuji_n2> we said it under the travel room
[2:04:03] <akitanito> portrait summon is where it's at
[2:04:03] <%TheDullaMAN> It's directly under the WARP
[2:04:05] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> oh it's under the warp point
[2:04:06] <%MelBrooksKA> Apparently lava is pretty thick and it would just feel like falling on concrete before you burst into flames and die from the toxic fumes
[2:04:07] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> That IS a picture of Lynus tho
[2:04:08] <+AlucardX60> OD is below the transport
[2:04:08] <Komayeda> it's like, below the warp point

[2:05:18] <Profmcstevie> Humans are less dense than Lava so we'd never sink into it, nor would we just lay there as the sheer heat would launch us up into the air as we skeet around burning to death.....Science pattyDimmaDab
[2:05:20] <%pectusumbra> can't you buy alkahest?
[2:05:23] <%MelBrooksKA> psa1guy

[2:05:48] <+rasend0ri> O.D. Backwards is DIO
[2:05:50] <SaltyAzteca> "You seem to know alot" "BARK"
[2:05:57] <%BlueLunecy> Why is this man grey Alucard
[2:05:58] <penitentpendant> I see "O D" and I just think "Other Dracula?"

[2:06:25] <hollumdusk> @BlowFireThroatTotem Orlok Dracule
[2:06:26] <%Valdorick> Photographs steal your soul! They were given to man by the DEVIL
[2:06:27] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> he's literally Alucard lol
[2:06:27] <itsdasteve> Obstinate Dracula
[2:06:29] <Komayeda> YEAH, Alucards Old VA came out of retirement to play that guy
[2:06:30] <%tank7013> I like the idea that demons just already invented photos
[2:06:34] <quintorro> ODor
[2:06:34] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Nah, look at his old ass
[2:06:40] <fuji_n2> OG Dracula

[2:06:51] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @Kiiper only if you have specific items in your inventory
[2:06:52] <@Fuggins4U> OD's VA is Alucard from SOTN
[2:06:57] <Ghufufin> is chewbacaa trapped in that book?
[2:06:58] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ...but how would a vampire be able to take pictures of themselves?
[2:07:00] <Komayeda> Ya know, OD backwards is DiO
[2:07:03] <%alphonseisbest> Hey Pat u recognize the VA for Meriam right? LUL
[2:07:04] <%Valdorick> "Original Dracul (Do not steal)", Backwards his name is D.O (Kanodioda)
[2:07:04] <Profmcstevie> Of course vampires are ahead technologically, they just fiddle with whatever "dark arts" they want
[2:07:11] <%Treuan> choo choo
[2:07:12] <itsdasteve> Now he's going to ship himself to Abu Dhabi
[2:07:16] <+Grayhammatter> oh, book do a buff

[2:07:39] <+Grayhammatter> just jump better
[2:07:40] <akitanito> str up
[2:07:42] <tattleworm> shame it's ugly
[2:07:44] <Ghufufin> reading is power!
[2:07:45] <ExpressNode> Knowledge is power
[2:07:48] <+rasend0ri> Boot kicks
[2:08:01] <%FacetiousAF> wiki says it buff STR
[2:08:02] <$ImExtremelyManly> book or knight is best familiar
[2:08:21] <%TheDullaMAN> Wrong door
[2:08:21] <@Fuggins4U> book talks to you when you save
[2:08:35] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Big progress for a big boy
[2:08:35] <fuji_n2> I think it buffs more shit at higher grades
[2:08:37] <%FacetiousAF> with the double jump pat might be able to go get that silver night back at the grabby hand
[2:08:41] <%Bane_Kaikyo> yeah Book and sword are dope familiars.... I remember the Dullahammer Head was cool maybe as well?
[2:08:47] <%GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt did pat get bunny girl power yet?
[2:08:48] <itsdasteve> @ImExtremelyManly dul heads are a strong pick
[2:08:51] <%Valdorick> As I recall, Dullas are best familiar.
[2:08:51] <@Fuggins4U> book buffs STR and occasionally attacks
[2:08:52] <%HotSauceFiend> Are there castlevania games that are not worth going back to given age?
[2:08:53] <akitanito> CHOMP CHOMP
[2:08:56] <+rasend0ri> Did you listen to the book after you saved?

[2:14:40] <heartlesshealer> defeated HardMan
[2:14:41] <blitzmentalist> Nice
[2:14:41] <DXLelouch24> oh no that means Pats post is inadvertantly spoiling others on Omori
[2:14:42] <%pectusumbra> ot
[2:14:44] <DXLelouch24> cause trending
[2:14:51] <itsdasteve> @Zombrocom it's not
[2:14:55] <FullMetalSnorlax> fun fact, on hard mode, zangetsu wont help you in that boss fight. makes it way harder
[2:14:57] <MayShip> tbh, in the early game i just turned into a bunny girl because it hits hard
[2:15:00] <SaltyAzteca> Off he goes
[2:15:00] <Zombrocom> Dang
[2:15:01] <%pectusumbra> it's a cool boss though I like the Curse of the Moon version a little better
[2:15:04] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> wait Pats tweet is trending??
[2:15:04] <%cade_calrayn> now kiss
[2:15:06] <VioletBeat> Is that David (Snake)?
[2:15:08] <%SharkMissile> Ask him to teach you CQC
[2:15:13] <fuji_n2> what?
[2:15:13] <%AncelDeLambert> it's in ROT13
[2:15:15] <Komayeda> he put it in r13
[2:15:25] <SaltyAzteca> Eh?
[2:15:26] <kingra> What?
[2:15:27] <Profmcstevie> He NEVER said the spoiler
[2:15:28] <huskarl_zap> tell them bob's burgers is an omori
[2:15:29] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL LUL
[2:15:29] <Scamsy> :b:loodstained
[2:15:32] <fuji_n2> in r13 who will get spoiled
[2:15:33] <Komayeda> coulda put it in rot14
[2:15:35] <ComfyFox> @VioletBeat it is
[2:15:35] <%TheLordOfHats> Hey Pat, unrelated, but have you checked out Inside Job on Netflix? Seems like it'd be up your conspiracy alley.
[2:15:36] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt how do you feel about bloodstained?
[2:15:39] <%cooldude69xx> @DXLelouch24 I don't think it will
[2:15:40] <+Sleepy_Puma> Omori crybabies at it again
[2:15:41] <%SharkMissile> @VioletBeat No, it's Big Boss B^)
[2:15:53] <$StrawberryPantsu> The fuck is R014?
[2:15:53] <Parapattern> The warning at the very start of Omori spoils you on what the game is about
[2:15:53] <@ssjklyco> If it's Cipher, then that person who got spoiled went out of their way to be spoiled .
[2:15:54] <+rasend0ri> Don’t listen to them
[2:15:55] <$ImExtremelyManly> i beat omori and I have no idea what that means
[2:15:56] <tattleworm> boss shards always take too much mp
[2:15:57] <lloyddboy> it's spoiling for people who can inherently read rot13!
[2:15:58] <Ipsenscastle> 13 isn't nearly rotated enough
[2:15:59] <Zombrocom> Cool but hella jank its great
[2:16:00] <%luckysteak> pat, you can board the train again if you want, and there is a unique enemy there
[2:16:00] <%Valdorick> Its the Sympy of the Knight we deserve.
[2:16:03] <marsnbars> the only good build is Buer familiar Summon Buer spell tbh
[2:16:05] <DXLelouch24> Zangetsu completely carries Miriams ass there
[2:16:10] <%TheDullaMAN> You can re-ride the train to get anything you missed
[2:16:18] <MayShip> if you go the extra step to get spoiled thats on you dummy
[2:16:29] <SaltyAzteca> Ahhhhh Flying Dagger is busted
[2:16:30] <+Plus_On_Black> People love jumping out the window with so little context of anything.
[2:16:35] <%pectusumbra> yeahhh. And yes you can go back on the train however much you want now
[2:16:41] <SaltBuster> I like you got a shard of just some dude.
[2:16:50] <Komayeda> love the lil laugh these guys do
[2:16:50] <%Bane_Kaikyo> YO THAT FLYING DAGGER THING IS SICK ACCTUALLY
[2:16:53] <DXLelouch24> ninjas
[2:16:57] <%SaiyanShoto> What bugs me when people shout about spoilers is sometimes it’s not really spoilery unless you already know the spoiler
[2:17:04] <itsdasteve> pat do you accept weapon advice?
[2:17:13] <%Agami23> can you hold it down?
[2:17:14] <SaltyAzteca> Level it up to max and its BUSTED

[2:22:47] <tubit> 2 fast
[2:22:48] <%pectusumbra> HA. The fact that he has a death quote is amazing
[2:22:49] <%Bt_Robot> Why did you not eat food?
[2:22:50] <ZaerichAnakalypton> Food is heals
[2:22:50] <+Grayhammatter> food
[2:22:50] <%twistedj3ster> pizza heals a lot iirc
[2:22:51] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> discount 1st form Cell voice lol
[2:22:53] <SaltyAzteca> Yes you do, you have Three Pizzas
[2:22:59] <tattleworm> first time eating food'll give a perma stat boost too
[2:22:59] <kinkade_77> looks like a power rangers villain
[2:23:01] <$insaneintentionsyo> frog power
[2:23:01] <%luckysteak> also, you have a shortcut for boss equips
[2:23:04] <fuji_n2> you can make em and buy em, also food heals
[2:23:05] <+Grayhammatter> you literally have pizzas
[2:23:06] <%pectusumbra> and other foods
[2:23:07] <+tempestzephyr> faerie has some healing
[2:23:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> foods do a lot of healies
[2:23:09] <%FacetiousAF> food = heal, yes
[2:23:10] <+SaltyTyrz> imagine that on the switch version
[2:23:11] <artoflec> how much do you heal IRL from a frozen pizza
[2:23:14] <MayShip> food is a good healing alternative
[2:23:16] <Parapattern> Pizza time
[2:23:16] <zzNamttamzz> Pizza Time 🍕
[2:23:21] <akitanito> higher tier food heals more
[2:23:21] <marsnbars> food is MOSTLY for the stat gains
[2:23:22] <fuji_n2> some food heals A LOT
[2:23:23] <captain_kirkhammer> Lots of food havbe *ridiculous* healing
[2:23:23] <$insaneintentionsyo> food can give permanent upgrades
[2:23:27] <SauceJockey> it's not
[2:23:27] <+TheBitingIrish> Most heal different amounts
[2:23:29] <tattleworm> there's food that'll permanently increase your magic regen
[2:23:31] <quintorro> i like his laser penis attack
[2:23:32] <fuji_n2> better than potions
[2:23:32] <%luckysteak> I get emotional healing from food
[2:23:32] <SaltyAzteca> No no, food is great, first time you eat food you get stat ups @PatStaresAt
[2:23:33] <$ImExtremelyManly> some heal  alot
[2:23:35] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> depending on the food item they can be full heals
[2:23:35] <%pectusumbra> food varies a lot
[2:23:35] <%Bt_Robot> It depends on the food
[2:23:43] <tolloponik> its a 1 time perma buff/ healer
[2:23:50] <SaltyAzteca> YEAAAAAAA
[2:23:51] <FullMetalSnorlax> Pizzza heals good but keep 1 pizza for a quest!
[2:23:57] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> another three pizza night for pat
[2:23:57] <+denizen_conspirator> @PatStaresAt I am not sure if you know this, but there is an area where you can grow corn, rice, wheat, and then produce the good healing items
[2:23:57] <blitzmentalist> catJAM
[2:23:59] <%twistedj3ster> He sounds like Burter from DBZA

[2:26:15] <@Fuggins4U> in this room
[2:26:23] <akitanito> better than kai leng
[2:26:35] <artoflec> i like the sound it does
[2:26:36] <%pectusumbra> You can also just use it as a long jump
[2:26:38] <%luckysteak> good for getting through narrow areas
[2:26:44] <%DEETRz> DEETRz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months, currently on a 42 month streak! 
[2:26:51] <%FacetiousAF> you might have seen those mirrors a place or two
[2:26:52] <$insaneintentionsyo> teleport
[2:26:53] <%WeLucklessJacks> But is it time stop though?
[2:26:54] <Profmcstevie> It's a short range blink if you want it to be
[2:27:00] <@Jekado> try it with kicks
[2:27:04] <FullMetalSnorlax> use the flying kicks after
[2:27:07] <%luckysteak> can you do the kick combo out of it?
[2:27:08] <captain_kirkhammer> You can do it with good timing
[2:27:09] <tattleworm> use your un deux trois out of it and you can make it
[2:27:09] <+rafaelba93> boots?
[2:27:13] <akitanito> poisoned-poisoned-poisoned
[2:27:14] <fuji_n2> you can jump out of it with the double jump, but it's iffy also kicks
[2:27:15] <%Bt_Robot> You can level it up and it goes further
[2:27:21] <+rasend0ri> Use boots
[2:27:24] <+KingKrampus> why does everything sound like goopy meat
[2:27:26] <%GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt pat use the boots combo to get over there?
[2:27:26] <$StrawberryPantsu> It's not as busted as that Strider (2013) dash
[2:27:27] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt you can make it to that room if you try
[2:27:27] <UnImprest> you can do it

[2:40:36] <MayShip> you did it
[2:40:36] <@Jekado> its not perfect but the books help in these areas
[2:40:49] <+KingKrampus> @bigfingerro is there? I'll need to look at it then, I love me some games that just take Catholicism Aesthetics and just run with them
[2:40:52] <fuji_n2> eyyyyyyy

[2:41:04] <zzNamttamzz> Silver knight KomodoHype
[2:41:06] <+twohitgood> silver knight is good but my favorite one is a different familiar.
[2:41:09] <+Grayhammatter> silver CHARIOTTO
[2:41:10] <%FacetiousAF> the early one was the grabby hand fight
[2:41:11] <marsnbars> buer is the best one

[2:41:13] <%pectusumbra> There's one hidden in the glass hand boss room

[2:41:22] <DXLelouch24> Pat Polnareff
[2:41:26] <SaltyAzteca> Not even Chariot, cuz thats a lance
[2:41:29] <%holydeviant1> Oh man, the library. This is where I remember starting to feel explicitly OP thanks to food hunting
[2:41:29] <%Agami23> i think all his shards are in puzzle-ey areas
[2:41:29] <FullMetalSnorlax> you gget in the boss that gives you th giant hand if you are lucky, you can go back to tht room for anoyther one
[2:41:32] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @patstaresat you get get the Silver Knight in the boss room with the stained glass spider
[2:41:32] <+AlucardX60> @PatStaresAt You can get him after Craftwork if he doesn't throw the second statue.
[2:41:37] <BigFingerRo> @KingKrampus yes, I have it actually! though idk how easy it'll be to find, it was a rather limited print
[2:41:38] <+rasend0ri> SHIVA CHARRIOTO!!!!!!!!
[2:41:53] <akitanito> keep the books up
[2:42:08] <SaltyAzteca> mimic deez nuts
[2:42:13] <akitanito> big cursed
[2:42:15] <Treasure_Vault> Yeah!
[2:42:18] <Treasure_Vault> Mimics are the coolest
[2:42:27] <ComfyFox> mimic.exe installed
[2:42:30] <Treasure_Vault> Are mimics and chest mimics the same thing? Discuss.
[2:42:31] <%pectusumbra> god that mimic design is so good it literally makes me question what family to put mimics under
[2:42:34] <+KingKrampus> @bigfingerro a PHYSICAL book?? I thought you meant a digital pdf, goodness that'll be a feather in the cap of my collection
[2:42:44] <%Logoth_> She doesnt want blue
[2:42:45] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:43:02] <+ChaosedStar> @PatStaresAt does this count as a mind goblins game?
[2:43:03] <%king_wragles> @Treasure_Vault I sense a slight bias with your opinions on mimics, what with the username
[2:43:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Kappa

[2:43:53] <akitanito> keep the portraits up
[2:43:57] <%notsoy> nice jumping
[2:43:58] <tattleworm> that was distressing
[2:44:00] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Looks like pat needs to stock up on healing items and craft a fuckload of food next time he's at base
[2:44:00] <+KingKrampus> pizza pizza
[2:44:01] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> did he just eat the last pizza? that's gonna suck for the hungry old lay quest
[2:44:10] <BigFingerRo> @KingKrampus if you can find it, it's a jewel. the cover is all embossed with golden letters and, with the second edition, you get a pretty foiled print of the lady of the 6 pains
[2:44:21] <BigFingerRo> hardcover of course

[2:46:00] <akitanito> magic just seems superior
[2:46:02] <%Valdorick> Big Sword does 60 damage "nah, whip"
[2:46:04] <%pectusumbra> Remember the words of the scaleless bitch pat! LIGHTNING
[2:46:05] <+KingKrampus> @bigfingerro I don't mind paperbacks,but if it's an artbook, hardcover is best
[2:46:11] <Komayeda> oh dang, ya got it
[2:46:12] <blitzmentalist> Nice
[2:46:12] <@Jekado> generally magic is best
[2:46:14] <+AlucardX60> Rhava is just good in general.
[2:46:16] <%umbranviking> psaDab
[2:46:20] <Zombrocom> Lightning is STRONG
[2:46:22] <hakumaribo> ah man you didnt get the shard
[2:46:30] <Treasure_Vault> Room below save, there is a secret ceiling breakable wall. Like 80% sure.
[2:46:38] <@Jekado> no
[2:46:40] <%pectusumbra> I believe you can farm him later
[2:46:40] <fuji_n2> yeah he's a "boss"
[2:46:41] <+AlucardX60> He's an enemy later.
[2:46:43] <%luckysteak> he becomes a regular enemy later
[2:46:44] <%MonsterEnvy> This guy is special amoung bosses
[2:46:48] <FullMetalSnorlax> that is the only boss that isn't garanteed
[2:46:49] <ComfyFox> you'll see later
[2:46:51] <$lotharrio> Only fight once? HahaBaby

[2:47:08] <Treasure_Vault> Yeah
[2:47:10] <+rasend0ri> That’s not a real boss
[2:47:12] <Treasure_Vault> Middle of room.
[2:47:13] <%SharkMissile> PogFish
[2:47:19] <fuji_n2> int hat
[2:47:19] <@Jekado> classic Castlevania boss becomes regular enemy
[2:47:22] <%pectusumbra> it's a good mage hat
[2:47:26] <FullMetalSnorlax> it gives really good INT
[2:47:30] <akitanito> time to be a chinese zombie
[2:47:32] <+KingKrampus> @logoth_ how else do you heal from stress
[2:47:33] <hakumaribo> it appears later, the shard itself melts enemies in seconds, since you can hold the attack button down.
[2:47:49] <%MonsterEnvy> The Abyssal Guardian is strong but he was not very complicated by boss standards
[2:47:51] <%pectusumbra> Also yeah, fun for coplaying your Miriam monster girl :p
[2:47:54] <SaltyAzteca> Soon...
[2:47:56] <+KaosMachina> oh I think that's a backer boss
[2:47:56] <zzNamttamzz> Shits locked
[2:47:58] <%luckysteak> key of platforming required
[2:48:02] <+KaosMachina> I might be remembering wrong
[2:48:07] <BigFingerRo> @KingKrampus These days, I feel, if you're buying books, like physical books, you get em because they're nice to have and hold, otherwise, you'd just get digital. Paperbacks are ok, for smaller publications, but in general, I feel hardcovers should be the standard
[2:48:09] <TheHotStuven> OOOOooo
[2:48:10] <+Grayhammatter> shit's locked
[2:48:24] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @Logoth_ you mean a sigh of relief?.... a common expression that has nothing to do with sex?
[2:48:28] <%Bt_Robot> You don't have enough strawberries collected in your Celeste save file to open that door
[2:48:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> how boy
[2:49:03] <fuji_n2> eyyy
[2:49:08] <%FacetiousAF> now he stronger
[2:49:09] <tattleworm> powers it up
[2:49:10] <%pectusumbra> more ranks to make him stronger
[2:49:12] <+AlucardX60> Stronger silver chariot.
[2:49:13] <%FacetiousAF> stack shard for more power
[2:49:14] <fuji_n2> you need 9 to max him out
[2:49:14] <FullMetalSnorlax> each one makis it stronger
[2:49:14] <%TheDullaMAN> More shards equal stronger
[2:49:18] <%MonsterEnvy> That's good Silver knight stronger now
[2:49:19] <%Valdorick> Its stronger now.
[2:49:19] <+KaosMachina> Familiar souls get more powerful the more you get
[2:49:25] <Daniel_Is_I> Higher grade = higher stats
[2:49:31] <Ipsenscastle> @BigFingerRo i generally wait for the paperback release of books to save shelf space
[2:49:32] <tattleworm> sword swings just fine
[2:49:32] <+KingKrampus> @bigfingerro see, I don't care for digital as much, so paperback or hardcover, as long as I can hold it in my hands, feel its physical presence in the world, I'm happy
[2:49:33] <@Jekado> he gets more abilities too
[2:49:34] <ComfyFox> he can also deflect enemy projectiles
[2:49:36] <%Valdorick> *EVERY* (nonboss) shard can stack to 9 shards
[2:49:37] <hakumaribo> silver knight is actively more aggressive then the other familiars
[2:49:40] <fuji_n2> 9 chariots for requiem Lappa
[2:49:42] <%JonathLP> Summon Chair is great
[2:49:43] <tattleworm> summon chair secretly game breaking, this is not a joke
[2:49:43] <+AlucardX60> But Dantelion make YOU stronger and YOU attack the enemies.
[2:49:44] <fuji_n2> Kappa
[2:49:48] <%Mr_Pylon> I do like that bouncing pig thing

[2:49:52] <SaltBuster> SUMMONS A CHAIR
[2:49:56] <%Bt_Robot> Summon Chair is op
[2:49:56] <+balouie> love summon chair
[2:50:00] <%pectusumbra> homing arrow
[2:50:01] <%Treuan> Summon chair would be fantastic
[2:50:01] <@Jekado> the fact that shards have levels AND stacks is fun
[2:50:06] <%Valdorick> OH SHIT I FORGOT ABOUT SUMMON CHAIR
[2:50:09] <FullMetalSnorlax> A chair to surpass metal gear
[2:50:14] <DXLelouch24> speaking of chairs someone made Chairith a thing(a mod)
[2:50:14] <+rasend0ri> Does exactly what it says on the tin
[2:50:15] <+TheBitingIrish> Both arrow shards are pretty good
[2:50:18] <%holydeviant1> @tattleworm But it requires another shard, right? It's been a hot minute
[2:50:20] <fuji_n2> summon chair build is dope
[2:50:24] <+KaosMachina> will Soul Grinding happen offscreen
[2:50:24] <%NitronStreams> I summon Chair in attack mode
[2:50:32] <@Jekado> how did the books stay in?

[2:51:50] <+ChaosedStar> could u play this familiar only TPFufun
[2:51:59] <%holydeviant1> Pat, have you been eating a lot of new foods ingame? The bonus stacking tends to get out of hand sooner rather than later
[2:52:00] <%maskofmichael> we all love mama
[2:52:07] <%pectusumbra> @ChaosedStar yes but it'd be AWFUL
[2:52:11] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> what did he get???
[2:52:20] <+KingKrampus> like they could have used The Count of Saint Germain as the villain, tap into the Ascended Masters shit
[2:52:22] <%shurtal> What do i follow up a SHITTY Nabriales trial with? An EVEN SHITTIER Castrum run, HELL YEAH
[2:52:25] <+rasend0ri> That’s a judgment cut
[2:52:38] <+TopTieramisu> this game has its share of castlevania callbacks
[2:52:47] <+ChaosedStar> @pectusumbra i wanna see some1 do it

[3:25:27] <+pkmamsters> i love the eee oo man so much
[3:25:28] <SaltyAzteca> Celeste key, thats for the livre ex machina area I think
[3:25:30] <artoflec> it will unlock you having to play Celeste
[3:25:37] <DXLelouch24> if this was Max hed cut to outro
[3:25:39] <+valiard> Why not Riga Dohin?
[3:25:40] <%AncelDeLambert> it sounds like the fairies are saying "fuck you" and that is funny to me
[3:25:42] <+Grayhammatter> you... did it
[3:25:44] <+rednecked__crake> he's so gonna get spoiled on what to do I bet tyongPhone
[3:25:49] <+NoriBasket> Bunnymorphosis unlocked something within me
[3:25:57] <jetstreamlove_R> end game and no credit scene?
[3:26:01] <%TheDullaMAN> Wear that Ribbon, Pat!
[3:26:10] <%MonsterEnvy> It was by the Dragon
[3:26:10] <%pectusumbra> it was in the library, close to where you came in this zone
[3:26:17] <President_Pariah> Celeste key isn't the answer
[3:26:18] <%MonsterEnvy> The big Dragon
[3:26:18] <%shurtal> Celeste key? Need like 40 strawberries for that @PatStaresAt
[3:26:19] <%AncelDeLambert> I had to do things, can Pat water winkwink?
[3:26:19] <Treasure_Vault> There's one more breakable wall in this zone, in the 2 tall 3 wide room near where he entered the whole area. An MP up.
[3:26:24] <DukeBlack_> Didnt order of ecclesia do this?
[3:26:29] <+rasend0ri> Yes you can get up there
[3:26:37] <fuji_n2> I, without knowing avoided the bad ending and now I gotta replay it for the achievo
[3:26:39] <%holydeviant1> @DukeBlack_ And SOTN
[3:26:53] <Treasure_Vault> above the save room, far right.
[3:26:55] <Treasure_Vault> two above
[3:26:56] <@Jekado> And Dawn of Sorrow
[3:27:01] <@Jekado> and Aria of Sorrow
[3:27:07] <%pectusumbra> @DukeBlack_ and both Aria and Dawn of Sorrow
[3:27:08] <$spardanwarrior> And Portrait of Ruin
[3:27:09] <DXLelouch24> Aria has a bad end as well
[3:27:12] <Zourath> @DukeBlack_ It's easier to count the igavanias that didn't do this.
[3:27:17] <TheHotStuven> and portrait of ruin
[3:27:21] <$insaneintentionsyo> dreamt12Dawei
[3:27:28] <%greasypete00> OOOO

[3:27:34] <DXLelouch24> Igarashi loves his BAD END fuck you play more
[3:27:34] <fuji_n2> every ds castlevania Did it
[3:27:39] <DukeBlack_> Aria ending wasnt a game over tho
[3:27:43] <%holydeviant1> @spardanwarrior It's actally kept me from getting to PoR's back half because FUCK THAT GODDAMN PURIFICATION FIGHT
[3:27:44] <+rednecked__crake> ee oo
[3:27:48] <Profmcstevie> Aria and Sotn to my memory treated the "false ending" like any other ending, if a bit anticlimactic
[3:27:51] <@Jekado> i can't remember if every GBA ending did?
[3:27:52] <%SharkMissile> Yeah!
[3:27:56] <%SharkMissile> That was awesome
[3:28:02] <HeroToxiko> better find your way before you vanish into dark 🤓
[3:28:03] <President_Pariah> not only did every exploration focused Castlevania introduce early bad ends, but practically every indie metroidvania has them too as tribute
[3:28:04] <%TheDullaMAN> Pat, you just want FromSoftVania
[3:28:05] <TurtlesAndTentacles> no
[3:28:08] <+twohitgood> i'm expecting elden ring to have a 4 phase boss.

[3:28:27] <penitentpendant> The Scrublem Flubro ending, or the Glebloe Cubrem ending, whiche will people like better in Elden Ring?
[3:28:30] <%holydeviant1> Hollow Knight's bad end was really sad
[3:28:30] <%tank7013> Well that was a thing to come back to. The Titty Dungeon?
[3:28:35] <SaltBuster> my favorite from software area is the tiddy dungeon

[3:29:58] <DXLelouch24> hits as fast as you mash
[3:29:59] <President_Pariah> atk speed and animation cancelling is better than big raw slow damage
[3:30:01] <akitanito> Rhava
[3:30:03] <fuji_n2> farm shit to make stronger shit
[3:30:10] <%TheDullaMAN> He can't make stronger until he farms mats.

[3:30:56] <%TalisKanju> Oh yeah, this room
[3:30:57] <+Cityscape17> Whats up with this room?
[3:30:57] <+rasend0ri> This room sucks
[3:30:58] <artoflec> inner peace
[3:30:58] <$insaneintentionsyo> nothing
[3:30:58] <SaltyAzteca> Ohhhhh @Jekado
[3:30:58] <+AlucardX60> This is it.
[3:30:59] <Profmcstevie> A memorial to all the PUSSIES
[3:30:59] <President_Pariah> don't think about it too hard, this is just a cute backer room
[3:30:59] <Daniel_Is_I> No items, just music boxes and a ghost
[3:30:59] <%TheDullaMAN> An experience
[3:31:01] <%maskofmichael> a nice song
[3:31:01] <%MonsterEnvy> I think it's just cute
[3:31:02] <SaltBuster> you getcat?
[3:31:04] <+Grayhammatter> nothing
[3:31:04] <%cvp5127> eww
[3:31:05] <jetstreamlove_R> loving kitty of course
[3:31:06] <%AncelDeLambert> CURSES! Chilled out again!
[3:31:07] <+lojack69> I don't get it...
[3:31:08] <@Jekado> yeah got a room dedicated to their pet that passed i think?
[3:31:08] <fuji_n2> this room is just an Easter egg
[3:31:13] <%Taisuru> One point for the Backers
[3:31:14] <tolloponik> either a boss fight or nothing it's been to long
[3:31:14] <Zourath> To look at cat is it's own reward
[3:31:17] <%Warbot40> Wait isn't this a ref to the confession room in SoTN?
[3:31:18] <+rasend0ri> NOTHING
[3:31:18] <%pectusumbra> the other two special rooms DO have stuff though
[3:31:19] <Veluren> Some backer doors have stuff, this one's just flavor
[3:31:20] <%Logoth_> Apparently that's a backer's cat
[3:31:24] <$ImExtremelyManly> congratulation
[3:31:25] <MattGetsGood> The blackest gift of all
[3:31:29] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat is aggravated, Smooth Jazz will now be deployed
[3:31:30] <%SveriSageAdvice> yeah i can confirm the cat portrait is a backer's passed away pet
[3:31:31] <+Cityscape17> You used a Stoneward Bone
[3:31:31] <%Logoth_> GOOD W-
[3:31:31] <%TheDullaMAN> You have a Ribbon, wear it.
[3:31:32] <MrJazzbo> "good"
[3:31:33] <+rednecked__crake> SourPls
[3:31:34] <fuji_n2> it's like that rhing in SOTN with the ghost priest
[3:31:35] <President_Pariah> @PatStaresAt all the blue locked doors are backer rooms, but the other 3 have secret bosses
[3:31:38] <SaltyAzteca> Cutpurse Ring for fat stacks?
[3:31:47] <HeroToxiko> bunnnBop
[3:32:00] <+NecDW4> I had to head out a bit... did he do the "this might as well be a Mega Man X2 bos" boss yet?
[3:32:06] <+NoriBasket> i was surprised by weapon special-moves
[3:32:15] <%RetroCop87> what's with the japanime swords in this European setting?
[3:32:15] <%MonsterEnvy> There are three weapons there that require Gram to make
[3:32:15] <%SveriSageAdvice> @NecDW4 yes
[3:32:16] <fuji_n2> make an flamberge
[3:32:17] <$insaneintentionsyo> ELMO
[3:32:18] <+rasend0ri> There is one on the ship
[3:32:27] <DXLelouch24> you need Legendary recipe or something for Rhava Velar so dont worry bout it for now
[3:32:28] <fuji_n2> you should be able to make shit out it
[3:32:31] <fuji_n2> maybe
[3:32:36] <+twohitgood> the flamberge is a key crafting weapon
[3:32:36] <danteftw20> crafting
[3:32:36] <%Bt_Robot> Make one of everything to unlock more recipies
[3:32:37] <%MonsterEnvy> Flambarge makes something cool
[3:32:38] <marsnbars> it has fire damage i think
[3:32:38] <+NecDW4> @SveriSageAdvice Shit, guess i gotta catchup on the vod
[3:32:40] <Mattais88> you can turn it into something later i think?
[3:32:41] <tolloponik> its a step to something really good
[3:32:41] <%TheDullaMAN> Unlocks more weapons to make
[3:32:44] <%pectusumbra> I thiink Betelguese is a gun? Also I think flamberge is a jumping off point for a bunch of other crafting swords
[3:32:53] <Profmcstevie> Things upgrade into others, probably a good tree
[3:32:54] <+Cityscape17> im so hi, I thought this was youtube XD
[3:32:55] <aeravon> sometimes you have to make things to unlock more stuff\
[3:32:55] <akitanito> you need weapons to craft higher tier weapons
[3:32:56] <fuji_n2> always make one of every weapon
[3:32:58] <$insaneintentionsyo> crafting is neat
[3:33:01] <PortableBoredom> Sort by category and you'll see stuff you can make
[3:33:04] <+AlucardX60> You need weapons to craft other weapons.
[3:33:16] <Profmcstevie> Strong weapons need base weapons
[3:33:19] <%Bt_Robot> There is a huge crafting tree for the ultimate sword
[3:33:24] <President_Pariah> i don't think that's true, making items to unlock items, you just need to find the crafting books
[3:33:29] <+SjoeB89> Make one of every weapon for complete unlocks
[3:33:36] <DXLelouch24> tho you need Rhava Bular which drops off of those scissor weapon guys to craft Rhava Valar
[3:33:39] <tolloponik> steel lightning is good
[3:33:47] <%Agami23> can you craft a flame ring?
[3:33:48] <%GalacticaPhanto> GalacticaPhanto subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! 34 months, happy or whatever, I'm here for Gief and Emlo, take money
[3:33:49] <%MonsterEnvy> I think you just unlocked in the makeable weapons a cool new thing
[3:33:54] <DXLelouch24> barbers
[3:33:55] <$insaneintentionsyo> fashion
[3:33:57] <%Agami23> i remember crafting being weirdly involved
[3:34:00] <Profmcstevie> If you get anything holy that's probably bitchin LUL
[3:34:03] <Profmcstevie> always is
[3:34:05] <FullMetalSnorlax> pat can you fed the grandma
[3:34:10] <%TheDullaMAN> Crystals are a little later on
[3:34:14] <%pectusumbra> at the very least I would recommend making elemental rings just because they boost your good shards.
[3:34:15] <Veluren> Crafting in this game is unbelievably beefy and in-depth
[3:34:23] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt I think OD lets you take out an extra book now
[3:34:25] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:34:27] <fuji_n2> if you make an item you unlock it for buying at domenic so yes make one of everything guy in chat
[3:34:27] <%MugenSandan> did Pat get Gram's move
[3:34:36] <akitanito> feed the not-paige grandma
[3:34:38] <OBS_VinnieK> at this point I think Sanjiegun is also one of the strongest weapons you can use, if you use it's special move
[3:34:40] <GenericSoda> I love that Todd levels up
[3:34:41] <%FacetiousAF> man pat, how long has it been since you came through this part of the castle
[3:34:41] <$insaneintentionsyo> nice face
[3:34:44] <%TheDullaMAN> Also, you have a Ribbon, it's good.
[3:34:47] <$insaneintentionsyo> Woolie waifu
[3:34:56] <akitanito> no, not karen
[3:34:57] <fuji_n2> take that shit out to see better
[3:35:03] <Treasure_Vault> Kairen
[3:35:05] <+AlucardX60> The hat hides some haircuts.
[3:35:05] <+valiard> Am i alone in thinking that this is good but i like hollow knight?
[3:35:10] <+TheBitingIrish> Take your shit mask off
[3:35:14] <+pkmamsters> i cant believe edward scissor hands just punched you in the back of the head
[3:35:14] <akitanito> complain to the castle manager
[3:35:18] <%maskofmichael> I want to see Dracula's manager
[3:35:20] <%FacetiousAF> be cool if there was stuff around here you missed
[3:35:21] <@Jekado> YEP
[3:35:22] <DXLelouch24> wonder if theres a mod to hide masks
[3:35:22] <%TheDullaMAN> You're where you need to be
[3:35:23] <fuji_n2> yeah kinda
[3:35:24] <%pectusumbra> I think that room to your left is a good start
[3:35:24] <+NoriBasket> not a bad strategy to hit every wall
[3:35:26] <+rasend0ri> That’s 2B’s hair
[3:35:28] <$insaneintentionsyo> we'll be here all night
[3:35:30] <MrJazzbo> that's the best part of the game FeelsGoodMan
[3:35:34] <GenericSoda> @valiard nah I think this game is really neat and creative, just Hollow Knight is a more quality product
[3:35:34] <SaltyAzteca> THE CONVEYANCE ARC STARTS NOW
[3:35:36] <Profmcstevie> face against walls "what's in here"
[3:35:42] <$insaneintentionsyo> distGasm 2B
[3:35:43] <marsnbars> the barbers very rarely drop a cool weapon but
[3:35:45] <%ospreyworks> ugh
[3:35:51] <%TheDullaMAN> Go Left
[3:35:54] <mj_gent> @SaltyAzteca Honestly, yeah.
[3:35:56] <Komayeda> so the thing ya gotta do to progress is kinda bs?
[3:36:00] <MrJazzbo> some of these enemy sounds are hilarious
[3:36:03] <%pectusumbra> oh yeah! go to the hand boss room for another silver knight shard!
[3:36:06] <+Grayhammatter> teps octopus
[3:36:15] <tolloponik> its so obtuse
[3:36:19] <+izanagi22> Teps Oceus was like my baseline ability for pretty much the entire game, so good
[3:36:27] <fuji_n2> another silver chariot
[3:36:34] <%RetroCop87> eh... fuckin... eh...
[3:36:40] <President_Pariah> you got <50% map progress and unexplored paths, this is the castlevania experience
[3:36:41] <+valiard> @GenericSoda yeah i hope the sequel feels better to play
[3:36:45] <+Grayhammatter> good idea
[3:36:47] <FullMetalSnorlax> GODRAYS
[3:36:58] <akitanito> big armor
[3:36:59] <SaltyAzteca> What a steal!
[3:36:59] <MrJazzbo> "Condition: GOOD"
[3:37:02] <+NoriBasket> Crusader Armor is more protective than an apron?
[3:37:06] <%GustauveVIII> recommend farming dullahammer heads offstream, but eh
[3:37:07] <%pectusumbra> It's not the highest but if you get it MUCH ealier in the game, it carries
[3:37:09] <+rednecked__crake> he finna die because he didn't crit that one enemy
[3:37:16] <GenericSoda> @valiard oh yeah, a sequel did get confirmed, didn't it? I think the gameplay feels fine, my main problem is some of the character models have uggo textures
[3:37:25] <%MonsterEnvy> You can copy Shortcut to shortcut
[3:37:28] <%MugenSandan> Has Pat tried doing a fireball motion with Gram
[3:37:38] <%TheDullaMAN> Go left.
[3:37:41] <%pectusumbra> yes he's done the special move
[3:37:42] <%MonsterEnvy> Yes
[3:37:57] <+WhiteRabbitM> @pectusumbra paredon, what item helps caryy ?
[3:38:02] <fuji_n2> need time stop
[3:38:02] <BlindGato> we shine spark now?
[3:38:06] <President_Pariah> btw, the blue chests respawn, it should be just food and materials
[3:38:06] <%TheDullaMAN> What've you unlocked as far as boos moves?
[3:38:11] <%TheDullaMAN> boss*
[3:38:15] <@Jekado> i think you can stomp kick a good ammount of your way up there
[3:38:15] <%pectusumbra> @pectusumbra crusader armor
[3:38:20] <PainterOfMiniatures> You fall
[3:38:26] <@Jekado> tho stomp kick is tricky
[3:38:28] <+NoriBasket> cat murder
[3:38:29] <fuji_n2> RIGA STORAEMA
[3:38:32] <%pectusumbra> THAT is my boss killer of choice
[3:38:33] <fuji_n2> LETS GO
[3:38:33] <%MonsterEnvy> You just got a really good shard
[3:38:35] <%Taisuru> Riga Stumbus
[3:38:35] <mj_gent> "Store-eye-ma"
[3:38:37] <%RetroCop87> Stomare. like that actor guy
[3:38:37] <%FacetiousAF> riga store ama
[3:38:38] <Profmcstevie> Cat Storm
[3:38:38] <%Bt_Robot> Remember yo also have enemy step
[3:38:41] <fuji_n2> that shit is tha bomb
[3:38:43] <%AoiRob> that's also really good
[3:38:45] <+tempestzephyr> Rigatoni
[3:38:47] <DXLelouch24> thos guys drop Rhava Bular to craft Rhava Velar
[3:38:52] <marvel877> Peter Stormare
[3:38:53] <%pectusumbra> that put me on a path to be a flame mage demon girl miriam
[3:38:54] <+rasend0ri> THAT SHARD IS GOOD
[3:38:56] <DXLelouch24> enjoy farming their ass
[3:39:00] <%TheDullaMAN> Reflector Ray
[3:39:00] <GenericSoda> Reflector Ray?
[3:39:04] <+valiard> @GenericSoda see i never found a weapon that felt good to use but i loved the fireball
[3:39:09] <MattGetsGood> Riga is good
[3:39:32] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt That shard you got from cat is really good
[3:39:38] <GenericSoda> @valiard I like the basic bitch longswords honestly
[3:39:39] <%Ne1son> Ma Kwi Tuhl
[3:39:44] <akitanito> the obsidian stick
[3:39:53] <%pectusumbra> ha
[3:39:55] <+valiard> Does pat not have the preset function on?
[3:39:57] <Mildly_Eccentric> You should go see if you can get your hands on eiccha
[3:40:11] <RLT917> aztec club retroPOG
[3:40:16] <+Grayhammatter> the hell is eiccha
[3:40:18] <GenericSoda> oh shit I recognize this area
[3:40:21] <$insaneintentionsyo> lmao
[3:40:24] <Profmcstevie> Acquire the blorgadoof
[3:40:27] <Profmcstevie> duh
[3:40:28] <fuji_n2> the fuck is eecha
[3:40:28] <%king_wragles> I think it's a craftable weapon
[3:40:32] <Mildly_Eccentric> Eiccha deez nutz
[3:40:35] <%RetroCop87> Pat doesn't know what eiccha is!
[3:40:36] <%Bt_Robot> Damnit Pat, you have dive kick
[3:40:36] <MrJazzbo> what's up Pat, is this game worth it's asking price to ya?
[3:40:39] <+NoriBasket> I'm glad I'm not the only one who has no idea what eiccha is
[3:40:39] <%Mr_Pylon> Don't you know Pat, you need the eiccha in order to appease the Flargle
[3:40:42] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Isn't that what Knuckles is?
[3:40:42] <Treasure_Vault> disregard blimdcrank for ending alpha:229
[3:40:48] <%MonsterEnvy> You can get up from here
[3:40:48] <%FacetiousAF> we don't talk about those kinds of animes here
[3:40:51] <quintorro> knuckles the eiccha
[3:40:52] <fuji_n2> angles how do they work
[3:40:52] <%pectusumbra> Chat stop
[3:40:54] <Vi_Stri> he obvs needs to get the baphmodad smh
[3:40:58] <hakumaribo> did they remove the ability to jump  when you leave reflector ray?
[3:41:02] <$insaneintentionsyo> MONKE
[3:41:06] <+valiard> @GenericSoda oddly enough flying sword for quite a bit
[3:41:11] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You should try that new shard the Cat gave it's good
[3:41:14] <+Grayhammatter> MONKE
[3:41:17] <SaltyAzteca> Oh yeah you could have dive kicked the lights
[3:41:17] <%king_wragles> @Mildly_Eccentric oh god dammit
[3:41:20] <SaltyAzteca> I remember
[3:41:20] <+izanagi22> I do wish that ability had a way to lock in your aim, it can be really fidgety for stuff like that
[3:41:28] <%Logoth_> Its just the SOTN church
[3:41:29] <+TheBitingIrish> 'Eiccha' sounds like a lead-in, like 'ligma'
[3:41:29] <MattGetsGood> Timing your jump at the end can be tricky
[3:41:31] <@Jekado> WHATT.... SOTN noooooo
[3:41:40] <some_brave_apollo> it's a shame how bland and uninteresting some of the rooms in this game look
[3:41:41] <%Logoth_> Even the panorama background
[3:41:41] <%RetroCop87> Pat, did you hear about Lego canceling their Overwatch set because Blizzard?
[3:41:42] <%AkronymCLT> You saying it rings a bell?
[3:41:46] <fuji_n2> what fuck is symphony Kappa
[3:41:47] <$insaneintentionsyo> inside the bell?
[3:41:53] <@Jekado> but for real tho i got this map and SOTNs map confused when i first played this game
[3:41:55] <SaltBuster> can you go in the bell?
[3:41:57] <SauceJockey> jump into the bell
[3:41:58] <marvel877> anything in the bell?
[3:41:58] <%Logoth_> The only thing this game is missing in Skelerang
[3:41:59] <+izanagi22> Wait really? that's hilarious @RetroCop87
[3:42:27] <GenericSoda> if you find the reflector ray to annoying to use if you need to come back, there's a way to get up without it
[3:42:36] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You should try the new spell shard the Cat gaveyou
[3:42:39] <Lazyallaround> Chat I thought he beat this game a long while back
[3:42:43] <GenericSoda> it's some intentional sequence break tech tho
[3:42:48] <%pectusumbra> oh, I think there's a breakable in that bridge room
[3:42:48] <aeravon> bridge had a breakable ceiling
[3:42:48] <%AkronymCLT> It's even the same enemy types
[3:42:56] <%pectusumbra> a red one
[3:42:56] <Lazyallaround> Or got far into it
[3:43:00] <%pectusumbra> rigas something
[3:43:00] <%RetroCop87> Stomaire shard
[3:43:01] <%doomunderthestairs> nah he started but never finished
[3:43:01] <%TheDullaMAN> Riga Stormaer
[3:43:02] <%MonsterEnvy> Red
[3:43:02] <SaltyAzteca> Conjure, red shard
[3:43:02] <fuji_n2> Riga storaema
[3:43:02] <%Agami23> riga stromaire
[3:43:03] <mj_gent> "Riga Storaema"
[3:43:04] <+NoriBasket> it was called flame cyclone or something?
[3:43:05] <tolloponik> fuck those things
[3:43:08] <Mattais88> riga
[3:43:11] <%AoiRob> riga
[3:43:14] <+TheBitingIrish> Bolide Blast FUCKS
[3:43:22] <SaltyAzteca> Riga Mortisma
[3:43:26] <GenericSoda> I kind of wish the shards had the enemy names honestly, it would make it easier to keep together
[3:43:27] <MattGetsGood> Conjure
[3:43:29] <fuji_n2> lvl it up it cover the whole room
[3:43:29] <+Grayhammatter> yo that's pretty good
[3:43:29] <Lazyallaround> Ah I saw him stream it a week or so ago and thought. He beat it in one go
[3:43:32] <%Valdorick> It gains damage and an extra pillar every level
[3:43:37] <$insaneintentionsyo> insane120Ree
[3:43:37] <%TheDullaMAN> Ligma Nirvana
[3:43:38] <mj_gent> Rigatone Stromboli

[3:44:03] <Lazyallaround> @genericsoda omfg u have no idea how angry you made me by saying that good idea
[3:44:03] <SaltyAzteca> Nah thats normal
[3:44:04] <%RetroCop87> DON'T LOOK AT THE MOON
[3:44:06] <DXLelouch24> dont worry bout it
[3:44:10] <%Agami23> because time is convoluted?
[3:44:10] <+izanagi22> Maybe it's cursed
[3:44:11] <%pectusumbra> the law of sick boss fights
[3:44:11] <fuji_n2> indeed I wonder Kappa
[3:44:11] <tolloponik> and he got a harpies' wing
[3:44:15] <+NoriBasket> Pat you're just paranoid
[3:44:18] <%TalisKanju> That's no moon
[3:44:18] <+Grayhammatter> don't worry about it
[3:44:19] <%FacetiousAF> these floaty yellow fucks
[3:44:20] <SaltyAzteca> harmony of dissonance had that weather too
[3:44:20] <%GustauveVIII> could it be... the CURSE of the MOON?
[3:44:21] <%TheDullaMAN> Truly a ponderous query
[3:44:21] <President_Pariah> it's because of the Curse of the Moon, Pat
[3:44:22] <@Jekado> "shits fucked"
[3:44:25] <akitanito> that's a mouthful for a spell
[3:44:26] <%pectusumbra> it's a good boss shard
[3:44:27] <GenericSoda> @Lazyallaround it worked in Castlevania

[3:52:31] <%Agami23> they still feel like very different games
[3:52:39] <akitanito> bloodstained can be a tighter experience
[3:52:40] <captain_kirkhammer> Hollow Knight feels the best still imo
[3:52:57] <%RetroCop87> they hacked Super Metroid to have Metroid Fusion physics
[3:53:01] <Profmcstevie> Weight, gravity, movement speed, latency, etc.
[3:53:09] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> hollow knight with all the movement options is pure butter
[3:53:19] <+polothegreatest> damn hollow knight is 10/10
[3:53:38] <%pectusumbra> that's fair. I like this game and it's good but it's not perfect
[3:53:53] <+izanagi22> Also Ace Attorney games are basically books
