[0:38:36] <exalt4747> Pat ended up on a different tech branch thn I did rip
[0:38:38] <killenbigbugs> The beam aint super effective
[0:38:38] <Grennold> Get hyped for another 12 year wait for the next mainline AC game
[0:38:44] <Dragovus> I have no idea what's going on
[0:38:46] <%darcfowler1995> Then you should just do a multiplayer stream with everybody maybe just so that way you can build yourself up and get some interaction
[0:38:47] <+Shampoohyay> the sustained beam is for cheesing on planes, not so great for ground targets
[0:38:47] <aimlesshealer> I think you were flying a plane
[0:38:47] <%AncelDeLambert> @laguerrilha yes
[0:38:48] <Gruhunchously> A10 sounds like a YoRHa unit.

[0:39:22] <%Lithdoran> queen's custom is like the best upgrade
[0:39:24] <DirtyPopcornJ> Is he going to fly the plane nosediving diagonally through the whole mission to hit the ground targets?
[0:39:24] <layssaltflavor> he got no upgrade for lazer?
[0:39:25] <%AirlineFood74> You don't care about DAMAGE UP?

[0:39:48] <sileo_patronus> @Tohru_Adachi_ he saw last time
[0:39:50] <%ooblagis> Faster Missles with Better Tracking invalidate most mooks as easy kills
[0:39:52] <%AncelDeLambert> this is one of the arcade levels, where you have to rack up the most points
[0:39:53] <Kaitepaints> Remember when pat killed the dog in this game?

[0:42:10] <Triplicat> d00msdaydan did you also crash into the platforms a couple times
[0:42:10] <%skizzuto> is that a fucking laser
[0:42:10] <exalt4747> THE LASER IS SO COOL

[0:42:12] <%CJett92> "LAZER"
[0:42:13] <+justianxix> big laser

[0:42:14] <Ion_LaserX> Big LASER
[0:42:16] <+dodge_and_dust> is that a fucking laser?
[0:42:16] <%Iccirrus> TLS is so neutered in this game

[0:42:17] <Tucker0603> WAT?!?
[0:42:18] <+SimplyPandaz> Its a fucking laser
[0:42:18] <callsigneagle01> @AngriestPat Pat quick gameplay tip, the TLS can't go through cloud cover
[0:42:19] <%Fenlig> Thats dumb
[0:42:19] <%Sovspot> laser sucks
[0:42:20] <lloyddboy> MISSILE
[0:42:21] <layssaltflavor> laser is not what it used to be

[0:42:28] <+Shampoohyay> yeah this thing is not good for this mission
[0:42:28] <lloyddboy> MISSILE THO
[0:42:29] <%Starlight_Gamer> got that laser confused with the pulse laser
[0:42:32] <+d00msdaydan> @Triplicat the platforms, the boats, and don't get me started on trying to get the aces to spawn
[0:42:33] <%TheSpiritof2277> oh this laser, I thought it was the rapid fire one
[0:42:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> in context, number 3 is butt geyser, right?
[0:42:33] <%Sovspot> should have went with LASM
[0:42:35] <+thebonebard> thats a actual fucking laser
[0:42:35] <%QueequegTheater> Thunderhawk is still the best AWACS bt I love that Long Caster is obsessed with food
[0:42:36] <privatesargent> there are 2 lasers in this game, this one and another that acts more like a machine gun
[0:42:37] <%konekoryugamine> INcoming!!
[0:42:39] <%30Karb> >having to do diving strafes in current year
[0:42:41] <Patzzki217> Longcaster: IM MAKING FUCKING MAC AND CHEESE AND NO ONE CAN STOP ME

[0:42:47] <%QueequegTheater> Or any mission
[0:42:48] <%Iccirrus> LASM >EML > Everything else > TLS
[0:42:49] <+justianxix> Can hit the supports with it
[0:42:50] <%ooblagis> Yes it is. It's great for this mission
[0:42:51] <exalt4747> So what IS the laser for?
[0:42:51] <Triplicat> 4Head I know the feel
[0:42:53] <%QueequegTheater> laser is trash
[0:42:54] <%wolf34736> su37 doesn't have lasm
[0:42:55] <tag545> its the best. fly under the run way and wipe out the whole base
[0:42:56] <privatesargent> i think the machine gun laser is much better then the TLS
[0:42:57] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh hey you're fucking up Mother Base
[0:42:58] <+Krivvan> the laser is great for looking fancy in MP
[0:42:58] <+Tadashi047> TLS was great in the past games
[0:43:00] <Skatedeandre> Oh were doing the mission pat botched with 10 seconds left till completion
[0:43:01] <SoaringLettuce> youre wasting the laser every time youre not hitting something
[0:43:03] <supervyxen> @AngriestPat Pat use your TLS on the boats
[0:43:05] <+Shampoohyay> the laser is best for cheesing out planes from a distance
[0:43:05] <HailSeaser> Fox 1! Fox 2!
[0:43:05] <%konekoryugamine> PULL UP!
[0:43:07] <Halospaz117> The TLS really sucks in 7 compared to the other games
[0:43:08] <layssaltflavor> pulse is godtier for this mission u can fly inside the platform and fucknit

[0:43:36] <Caivyre> LUL
[0:43:36] <+drflashylights> you should use the TLS when you attack the struts

[0:43:44] <%Laecerelius> Shaka indeed
[0:43:44] <%Starlight_Gamer> You can flight right through it
[0:43:46] <wsintai> @AngriestPat How can you talk about PIZZA
[0:43:47] <%DougintheTrench> I didn't see it. Do it again!
[0:43:47] <%Remery_> Pat too hungry
[0:43:47] <%ThatGuyfromMars> with eyes closed
[0:43:47] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat you REALLY seem to enjoy just slamming your "character" into your opponents, regardless of game xD
[0:43:48] <gbrincks> That is the best plan, but slow and strong
[0:43:50] <Patzzki217> you can shoot the struts before getting the target for it
[0:43:50] <TerraWraith> Fly through the concrete building?
[0:43:51] <%Mr_Strut> You mean the thing that gets you kicked out of the airforce?
[0:43:51] <privatesargent> this missions is actually perfect for the Flanker
[0:43:53] <SoaringLettuce> you have to yaw
[0:43:53] <tag545> do it again but LASER
[0:43:53] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat it is actually doable to fly through em
[0:43:55] <exalt4747> How can you talk about MUSTARD
[0:43:55] <blackfire173> It’s ok
[0:43:57] <DirtyPopcornJ> Your plan was that you were going to reselect your plane is what it is
[0:43:58] <Archangel317> You are the coolest pat

[0:44:01] <%30Karb> You would have been pat, most of us are not part of the IJN circa 1939
[0:44:03] <%connos_livereview> SHAKA when the pat crashed
[0:44:03] <%konekoryugamine> Dude, just fly straight over the entire base and line laser it! Just RIGHT down the middle!
[0:44:03] <Gruhunchously> Every time Pat dies, the concerns of the squadron become more valid.
[0:44:05] <%Mr_Strut> Becuase flying between buildings is super dangerous
[0:44:05] <BorkchopSlamwiches> Pat you can land on the rocks if you need to get precise with the laser aiming
[0:44:05] <+Krivvan> the mission is hilarious with a Fullback too
[0:44:06] <%ooblagis> Laser
[0:44:09] <SulfurousAcid> use lzaer
[0:44:10] <tag545> laser
[0:44:12] <%TheSpiritof2277> MISSILE
[0:44:17] <zafooru> just do it perfect this time without doing bad
[0:44:18] <SoaringLettuce> also, actually use the laser
[0:44:18] <%Tokanova> 1
[0:44:18] <gbrincks> Laser!
[0:44:20] <callsigneagle01> it's not activated yet
[0:44:22] <%QueequegTheater> Wiseman has to point it out
[0:44:24] <%connos_livereview> STORY THATS why
[0:44:24] <Halospaz117> The cores aren't marked until later, but you can hit them before then
[0:44:24] <Triplicat> rip boresight targeting
[0:44:24] <callsigneagle01> wait till Wiseman does his thing
[0:44:25] <+justianxix> gotta wait for Wiseman
[0:44:25] <tag545> cant target until tutorial
[0:44:27] <Patzzki217> targets only show up when wiseman destroy one
[0:44:27] <tag545> but laser
[0:44:28] <+Tadashi047> use the laser
[0:44:29] <dragoon001914> You can only target it when they realize it can be hit
[0:44:30] <%QueequegTheater> It's not on the IFF
[0:44:30] <privatesargent> you can't target it yet, they have to tell you that you can
[0:44:30] <Grennold> You can't target the cores until Wiseman says so
[0:44:31] <Valdorick> @AngriestPat By the way, can you still auto target something in the middle of your screen by holding down the target selection button?
[0:44:31] <WanderingFlame7> MISSILE!!!
[0:44:32] <+Reizie_Etherealm> You gotta wait until the dialogue gets to that point
[0:44:34] <layssaltflavor> u gotta use lazer my dude
[0:44:34] <+Shampoohyay> you gotta wait for someone else to have the good idea
[0:44:34] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat You have to use your guns or laser first on the struts or let Wiseman shoot them first.
[0:44:35] <%konekoryugamine> YOU CAN STILL
[0:44:40] <%Sovspot> wait for set piece to happen
[0:44:41] <%Ozymandias555> @AngriestPat either you or Wiseman points it out, then it becomes a target
[0:44:41] <%konekoryugamine> Aim for the suports!
[0:44:41] <%Laecerelius> Laser that shit!
[0:44:41] <ItIsSky> the targets are a story trigger
[0:44:43] <%konekoryugamine> The strats!
[0:44:43] <+ilasper1> PICKLE
[0:44:45] <%Starlight_Gamer> you can target the pillars before wiseman
[0:44:46] <%konekoryugamine> Aim for the strats!
[0:44:46] <The_500lb_Child> You can activate it sooner if you destroy it without lock on.
[0:44:49] <Gruhunchously> Don't you see, the power to destroy the cores was ALWAYS within you.
[0:44:51] <+Robopengy> Has Pat assassinated that guy yet?
[0:44:51] <%JayEarly> You can’t target the cores but you can shoot them
[0:44:52] <%ooblagis> You need to destroy one before you get to target them
[0:44:52] <privatesargent> focus on the ships until Wisemen points out you can destroy them
[0:44:54] <+Shampoohyay> is the sound changing pitch weirdly or am i crazy
[0:44:54] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Incorrect weapon system / platform type for mission?
[0:45:04] <%ooblagis> Or let him do it
[0:45:04] <%Lithdoran> you need to break one before they're targetable
[0:45:05] <%Laecerelius> Temba when Pat ate the missile

[0:45:45] <+JackMillerTime> fight for love, fight for sandwiches
[0:45:47] <%ooblagis> @AngriestPat The Laser is super long range, and does huge damage, it can take out a BUNCH of stationary targets at once

[0:56:32] <Run44forrest> thats how plane work
[0:56:33] <%TRILLTURBAN> because that's how planes work
[0:56:33] <exalt4747> Pat, turn on the reduced collision damage
[0:56:33] <+Matromon> coz thats the way planes workl
[0:56:33] <%skizzuto> pat you're going like 1000 speed
[0:56:33] <TheSpartanThief> Just roll it back Pat
[0:56:34] <$nademonkey1100> FUCK YOU MOOBOT
[0:56:34] <hntronium> Pat your skills have degraded
[0:56:35] <+zaworldo> PLANES ARE FRAGILE
[0:56:35] <%AncelDeLambert> this is incredible
[0:56:37] <gbrincks> Pat, don't taste the platform!

[0:56:40] <%AncelDeLambert> STFU Count
[0:56:40] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> because that's not how planes work
[0:56:40] <sileo_patronus> Because you're FLYING A PLANE AT HIGH SPEEDS
[0:56:40] <Gruhunchously> Count makes a good point.
[0:56:41] <third_impact_762> go play RE man
[0:56:41] <%Laecerelius> Planes are made of tinfoil and dreams, Pat

[0:56:43] <%Finalknightmare> EZ MODE UNLOCKED
[0:56:43] <+lucaflow> Most planes try to avoid the ground pat
[0:56:44] <ape_hawk> sorry, im gonna eat while i work
[0:56:45] <privatesargent> well, you could skip off the ground, but clipping a wing generally knocks you out
[0:56:45] <NinjaTB> pat, there is literally an option to reduce impact damage...
[0:56:46] <layssaltflavor> theres an upgrade to have some def for ground dmh
[0:56:46] <%nocko_> Go for the platform
[0:56:47] <supervyxen> pat play in first person or cockpit view it's easier i swear
[0:56:47] <%topendbuzz> because thats how planes work
[0:56:48] <callsigneagle01> get the scrub part that reduces ground impact damage
[0:56:48] <dekkitout> Planes are allergic to everything that is denser than air
[0:56:50] <%kiiiirsten> It's touching it REAL fast tho
[0:56:50] <Guardiansaiyan> L O R E
[0:56:51] <%Divryne> That kills you IRL.

[0:56:57] <rytisone> Just dont do risky moves like a sissy person
[0:56:58] <gbrincks> The plane is a sensitive thing and it needs tender loving
[0:57:01] <%connos_livereview> yeah but youre travelling at mach 1
[0:57:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> A snickers is a euphemism for a penis in this situation
[0:57:03] <%Iccirrus> try clipping a wall going over 1k KPH
[0:57:06] <$nademonkey1100> how fast are you going ?
[0:57:08] <gustavozxd> yukari? LUL
[0:57:08] <Toxic_Phazon> You're a plane not a tank.
[0:57:09] <+R0bobot> There is literally a mod for babies who hit the ground a "little bit"
[0:57:09] <%Iccirrus> it's going to hurt
[0:57:10] <%ThatGuyfromMars> it's not about touching it, you're moving really fast against a stationary object
[0:57:11] <Fujiwara_92> @angriestpat at what speed is it touching a little tho?
[0:57:16] <%topendbuzz> wow no need to call him fuckface chat
[0:57:16] <sileo_patronus> Stop trying to play better than you are
[0:57:17] <%Remery_> Pat is a slutty roast beef sandwich :)

[0:57:30] <%30Karb> Do you not get chaff in this game?
[0:57:36] <+Tadashi047> there is
[0:57:37] <supervyxen> Pat the platform cores aren't vulnerable until Huxian calls them out
[0:57:37] <callsigneagle01> @30Karb you do
[0:57:38] <gbrincks> @topendbuzz Why not use his radion name?
[0:57:42] <%nocko_> You get flaires
[0:57:44] <layssaltflavor> hes not using chaffs for some reason
[0:57:45] <sileo_patronus> @topendbuzz why would we not use his name?
[0:57:47] <$Mendin> Wait is this MGSV? The siege of mother base?
[0:57:49] <TerraWraith> @30Karb You do

[0:58:03] <xeros720> it's funny to think that Pat is losing multiple times against stationary objects
[0:58:05] <Triplicat> 11
[0:58:06] <IminyourBase> use the laser you coward
[0:58:06] <giogio346> ace combat gets even less viewers than dbfz o_O

[0:58:16] <Grennold> He's a wise man PogChamp BRAVE KOJIMA
[0:58:20] <+stolando_florida> Paige might need to play this mission for Pat.
[0:58:21] <Valdorick> @Mendin Nah, this is just an FOB
[0:58:22] <callsigneagle01> If he needs to he can switch up the loadout
[0:58:25] <%connos_livereview> @Guardiansaiyan no
[0:58:26] <%LogothX> Well done burgers suck
[0:58:29] <%nocko_> Pat no fly
[0:58:31] <mackumbopus> Did he crash again?
[0:58:31] <%nocko_> Pat too short

[0:58:37] <supervyxen> pat big crashed
[0:58:39] <$Mendin> Imean t hey're talking about hamburgers a lot so it might be MGSV
[0:58:42] <Gruhunchously> What happens when a fast moving plane meets a stationary object?
[0:58:43] <%McSnazzyPants> you can shoot and destroy the platform cores before Wiseman, the dialogue even changes
[0:58:45] <%konekoryugamine> Glad to know my motion sickness isn't acting up
[0:58:45] <supervyxen> third person COWARD
[0:58:45] <%30Karb> @Tucker0603 >not with an F-5 She was the wing of the FREE WORLD

[0:58:52] <$cureneckbeard> They're speaking in metaphor like in Darmok

[0:58:57] <%nocko_> @AngriestPat Go for the back platform and fleet chief easier points
[0:59:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> Why would you ruin a burger by cooking it well done?
[0:59:03] <%connos_livereview> YOURE HITTING THE PIPEs
[0:59:04] <$GrugOfWar> why not use the a-10? It missle locks ground targets faster
[0:59:06] <SoaringLettuce> youre aiming at a bad angle!!!!
[0:59:06] <gbrincks> Kill their soldiers and fuck their planes, that's the motto of the Osean army
[0:59:06] <layssaltflavor> pat lazer the cores at least
[0:59:07] <TerraWraith> There's a fuck load of stuff in the way on that side
[0:59:09] <third_impact_762> litteraly not going to be able to finish this mission how your playing/ with that loadout
[0:59:10] <Gruhunchously> Bologna, when the walls fell.

[0:59:30] <+justianxix> nah hes fine
[0:59:30] <callsigneagle01> He can I think
[0:59:31] <Toxic_Phazon> How can this be?
[0:59:33] <supervyxen> @third_impact_762 Nah he should be fine. You can do the whole thing with just missiles and gun. TLS is good for boats too
[0:59:34] <%nocko_> YOU LITERALLY CANT
[0:59:34] <+R0bobot> Nah, you can do it
[0:59:35] <+delta_sigma> @AngriestPat 's spirit plane is the A-6 Intruder. Pity it's not in the game

[0:59:47] <%kiiiirsten> I clenched my beanhole on that one
[0:59:47] <TheSpartanThief> You keep hitting rebar Pat
[0:59:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> I believe in you Pat
[0:59:49] <%Starlight_Gamer> you can finish the mission with that loadout
[0:59:50] <%skizzuto> well your last attempt you had over 10000 points left to go with only five minutes
[0:59:54] <%connos_livereview> it would have been really funny if he crashed then
[0:59:54] <pillowwasp> Jesus Christ pat
[0:59:54] <layssaltflavor> u can resupply
[0:59:55] <exalt4747> I don't know planes. 7 is my first AC.
[0:59:55] <privatesargent> oh you can finish this missions with basic missiiles, you just need to stop crashing
[0:59:56] <TerraWraith> Ha ha
[0:59:56] <Videogamer4> NotLikeThis
[0:59:57] <tag545> laser is weak without the upgrades. pat die

[1:00:02] <lloyddboy> USE THE LASER
[1:00:05] <%QueequegTheater> @skizzuto He had plenty of time
[1:00:05] <TheSpartanThief> Just go for the obvious open holes
[1:00:06] <Dingo_Eejit> HAHAahAHAHAAHAhAHahaahAH
[1:00:07] <%Ozymandias555> @AngriestPat Pat buddy plz aim
[1:00:08] <Patzzki217> "IM A GENIUS, OH NO"
[1:00:08] <Tucker0603> the only SU good for ground is the 34
[1:00:08] <Mrchuckquizmo> I'm laughing so hard right now
[1:00:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> Use that Large Penis Energy
[1:00:10] <%konekoryugamine> You fucking top gun jackass
[1:00:13] <%TheSpiritof2277> let the spite power you
[1:00:15] <mackumbopus> Have you tried rotating your plane 180 degrees and the shoot your missle.
[1:00:17] <%Divryne> TIME LIMIT.
[1:00:17] <gbrincks> Oh gods, the crane
[1:00:18] <%QueequegTheater> @skizzuto He scored 15K in 7 minutes
[1:00:20] <Dingo_Eejit> Also SHOOT the GUN
[1:00:20] <%kiiiirsten> This is the only way to play
[1:00:22] <Gruhunchously> 'They took a bite out of me'. Always with the food metaphors.
[1:00:23] <third_impact_762> hes not making efficient gun runs on the platform. not maximizing "guns on target" time
[1:00:24] <+blastazoid26> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:00:25] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@delta_sigma) (warning)
[1:00:25] <%nocko_> @gbrincks Rafale is best for this mission
[1:00:28] <Valdorick> "They took a bite out of me" Is this entire team's schtick that they love food?
[1:00:28] <%nocko_> Cruise missles
[1:00:29] <%connos_livereview> you can TOTALLY clear this mission with basic missiles
[1:00:30] <Dingo_Eejit> Shoot their shit
[1:00:32] <SoaringLettuce> @exalt4747 a multirole would have been better, hes using a fighter against ground targets
[1:00:34] <%konekoryugamine> DUH
[1:00:35] <%Fenlig> Use the force Pat
[1:00:44] <Grennold> Fire at the sides with no obstructions PogChamp Fucking genius
[1:00:44] <TheSpartanThief> See, obvious...just go flat on the sqaures
[1:00:44] <dekkitout> Ha ha. Pat can't find the hole... ResidentSleeper
[1:00:48] <%AncelDeLambert> you can, put other weapons are faster and give you a higher score
[1:00:48] <exalt4747> Oh, I know that much. I used a bomber though
[1:00:49] <%konekoryugamine> Just like with Paige
[1:00:49] <+Reizie_Etherealm> He can totally do it, the laser has a good range and he can turn even if the laser hasn't ended
[1:00:54] <%QueequegTheater> @SoaringLettuce It doesn't really matter because each core is worth over a thousand
[1:00:56] <Gruhunchously> Pat, you've switched off your targeting computer, what's wrong?
[1:00:56] <Raishiro> pat sure loves doing his fancy himmelmans
[1:00:57] <FirearmsInstructor> He's like flying in upside-down pulling up only 19 ALT off the water lol
[1:00:57] <privatesargent> im surprised he isn't using a Fullback, that is a beast of an attack craft
[1:00:58] <%kiiiirsten> @Fenlig That is outstanding advice
[1:00:58] <+R0bobot> Okay pat, I have some advice for you. SLOW DOWN on approach. AND be level with the core. it should only take two missiles!
[1:00:59] <+delta_sigma> lmao
[1:00:59] <Videogamer4> LUL
[1:01:02] <%topendbuzz> to soon
[1:01:07] <%Divryne> Stop going slow.
[1:01:09] <Guardiansaiyan> This feels like a chill stream
[1:01:09] <layssaltflavor> yea he just needs to fire lazer at ultra long range
[1:01:10] <%nocko_> 10 minutes until he has to redo the mission chat
[1:01:12] <TerraWraith> That went directly into the platform to the right of it
[1:01:12] <%Divryne> The AA shoot you better.
[1:01:13] <%TenderBabyBacon> Respect the Pipe
[1:01:17] <callsigneagle01> he needs to go slow
[1:01:18] <+bdawg_3834> negative, just pecking on the surface
[1:01:19] <BorkchopSlamwiches> Seriously use your laser to shoot the cores...
[1:01:21] <mackumbopus> What are the wingmen doing?
[1:01:25] <Valdorick> @nocko_ that's optimistic, isn't it?
[1:01:32] <%konekoryugamine> Jegus FUCK man

[1:01:56] <dekkitout> Boats, the planes of the sea, equally sexy
[1:02:00] <exalt4747> On the cloud mission, when my initial hit didn't take out a thing, EVERYONE flew past it without going for it

[1:03:11] <privatesargent> if you focus on the cores, you can do this mission pretty easiliy, the problem is Pat keeps crashing

[1:06:55] <%ooblagis> More points
[1:06:55] <%AncelDeLambert> easy points
[1:06:56] <callsigneagle01> cause it's EASY

[1:06:57] <tag545> easier targets

[1:06:59] <exalt4747> lucky ted: ace pilot
[1:06:59] <%Iccirrus> because big points
[1:07:00] <%Divryne> Easy points.
[1:07:00] <+R0bobot> Fleet would be easier for you imo
[1:07:00] <tag545> time
[1:07:01] <callsigneagle01> not inherently
[1:07:01] <+thebonebard> to movling a little to the right or left
[1:07:01] <gbrincks> The Tunnel Run is the best tactic for the level, just don't fuck it up
[1:07:02] <Patzzki217> because its easy with the laser
[1:07:02] <%Ozymandias555> @AngriestPat you play it by ear, buddy. I trust your judgement. You almost had it last stream.
[1:07:02] <third_impact_762> cauase theres a fleet, to the east
[1:07:02] <Dingo_Eejit> sHOOT iT ALL!
[1:07:03] <Gruhunchously> Because easy points
[1:07:04] <%nocko_> @AngriestPat EASY POINTS
[1:07:04] <%AirlineFood74> EASY POINTS
[1:07:06] <callsigneagle01> it's about points
[1:07:08] <$GrugOfWar> This mission is a speed run mission.
[1:07:09] <bleugh> !uptime
[1:07:10] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 7m.
[1:07:10] <+justianxix> Kill everything
[1:07:13] <+R0bobot> you won't ahve time for all groups unless you are super good.
[1:07:13] <+Krivvan> The ace pilot can't spawn on your first run through the mission anyways
[1:07:14] <Videogamer4> Jesus fuck pat is still on this mission
[1:07:15] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat You have a time limit you can't kill everything.
[1:07:19] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat Destroying the fleet is easier than taking out the platforma
[1:07:25] <%QueequegTheater> Easier than the platforms you keep crashing into
[1:07:26] <supervyxen> Start on these platforms, then go to the fleet. Resupply, then finish off the thing you keep dying to.
[1:07:27] <+robert_edwards> your objective is to reach a score @AngriestPat
[1:07:28] <SoaringLettuce> no its a points mission, theres more enemies than you need
[1:07:33] <strider3571> killing all platforms is enough
[1:07:34] <IminyourBase> shouldn't lasers have crazy range? why are you so close?
[1:07:40] <Gruhunchously> Pay attention
[1:07:40] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat I'll send you the clip of a guy doing it, though to be fair he does have a to plane
[1:07:41] <%QueequegTheater> THAT'S A SUNK COST fallacy
[1:07:41] <%Typhaeon> Do you get credit for all of the emplacements on a strucutre when you destroy it?
[1:07:42] <FirearmsInstructor> Does the laser have "ammo" / energy? Cooldown?
[1:07:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> Fucking Lasers
[1:07:42] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I think you only have enough time to destroy 2 out of 3 places on the map
[1:07:44] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Finish the platform and try the fleet.
[1:07:47] <+R0bobot> You can usally get two groups
[1:07:48] <privatesargent> jesus that laser is weak, it took twice as long as it should to destroy that core
[1:07:49] <third_impact_762> cause hes NOT ACTUALY USING the laser
[1:07:49] <Mutanthunter> I had a funny feeling that was gonna happen
[1:07:51] <%laserbeaming> I didn't dare to ask before. But why does he have a dumb death laser?
[1:07:53] <callsigneagle01> He's doing good now
[1:07:55] <Gruhunchously> This isn't really a game where you can divide your attention.
[1:07:56] <supervyxen> @Typhaeon Yeah
[1:07:56] <tag545> you can kill all the ground targets if good enough but you don't need to
[1:07:57] <%Nobrev> wait is this still the mission pat quit on weeks ago
[1:07:59] <%TheSpiritof2277> you could kill most the things with a speedy craft and a PLSL
[1:08:01] <callsigneagle01> @laserbeaming cause they exist in AC
[1:08:02] <valachi> @laserbeaming Because Ace Combat
[1:08:02] <%Typhaeon> OK then
[1:08:04] <%vectorless_peon> you have more than enough time to kill the platforms foucus on them
[1:08:04] <%InsaneJackLondon> mmm borger
[1:08:07] <mackumbopus> Did he die again?
[1:08:09] <$Mendin> ugh Brendan Urie is pretty but far cry is dull to watch (and his facecam is too small)
[1:08:12] <$Mendin> back to Pat I guess
[1:08:19] <exalt4747> What planes get the PLS?
[1:08:21] <Gruhunchously> Slow and painful

[1:08:26] <%SpcOpsBear> this goddamn guy on AWACS needs to shut up about food before I end up having four meals today

[1:09:52] <+drflashylights> some ships take more than two missiles to sink

[1:09:59] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Boat AA is shooting your missles out.
[1:09:59] <third_impact_762> remeber when i said bad loadout
[1:10:01] <+d00msdaydan> can he not see the CIWS shooting his missiles down?
[1:10:02] <privatesargent> boats are tough, they take multiple runs if you aren't using anti-ship missiles
[1:10:03] <callsigneagle01> Close In Weapons System-gatling guns that track and shoot down missiles

[1:10:10] <+ArcanumMBD> They're shooting down one of your missiles every time
[1:10:11] <third_impact_762> if your not gonna use the laser take surface missiles
[1:10:15] <+robert_edwards> gee if only you had an ANTI ship missle
[1:10:17] <$Retrocop87> Pat, your judgement is fuzzy. Why not eat a sandwich?

[1:11:49] <strider3571> use a plane with LASM
[1:11:51] <TerraWraith> Just stop flying into shit
[1:11:51] <privatesargent> its cause you are using a fighter on ground targets
[1:11:52] <metrying> Youre the worst
[1:11:53] <%Starlight_Gamer> its not really tough
[1:11:54] <+Feralspirit41> this never wouldve happened in chaos legion

[1:12:03] <lionmanguy> You did it last time, with paige remember? You just screwed up at the end
[1:12:05] <%AirlineFood74> it's really not tough, you're just sucking ass
[1:12:06] <KaptainKappathe5th> cause you suck Kappa
[1:12:06] <tag545> when you point the laser at the water plane it means you are going towards the water plane

[1:12:16] <%ooblagis> They still can't ram boats and win....
[1:12:16] <+justianxix> you are just playing shit thats all
[1:12:17] <+Tadashi047> its an air superiority fighter
[1:12:17] <%QueequegTheater> IT'S NOT PAY 2 WIN PAT
[1:12:18] <+robert_edwards> f14 @AngriestPat
[1:12:18] <%connos_livereview> its a fighter
[1:12:18] <IminyourBase> water planes and air ships
[1:12:19] <Yrefe> mah number is SOOO BIG
[1:12:19] <supervyxen> F-4 UGB wrecks shit
[1:12:20] <c_drolet> you need a multirole at least
[1:12:20] <%Rikui_> maybe the pilot is bad
[1:12:20] <SoaringLettuce> no its not!!!!!
[1:12:20] <%Nobrev> it's because you're recklessly flying into shit
[1:12:21] <Gruhunchously> @QueequegTheater Jesse Cox has been remarkable fortunate.
[1:12:21] <$nademonkey1100> use the BBBBRRRRRRRTTTTT
[1:12:22] <callsigneagle01> Ground damage reduction man
[1:12:22] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat ITS A FIGHTER
[1:12:25] <Toxic_Phazon> Pat you're the problem not the plane
[1:12:27] <%wolf34736> su 34 with 4 agm would be better then the su 37
[1:12:28] <%lewdskeletor13> HOW CAN THIS BE
[1:12:28] <rytisone> use a zeppelin to carpet bomb those suckers
[1:12:29] <Valdorick> A2A planes don't fight Ships well, Pat.
[1:12:29] <person181> my number is BIG so why isn't it WORKING
[1:12:29] <+Krivvan> the SFFS destroys the cores straight through the top
[1:12:32] <shevan123> @AngriestPat just stop flying right into smoke when you know you cant see shit
[1:12:32] <%IMDRanged> apatJpeg JPEG Dog go down
[1:12:32] <%Iccirrus> su-33 + LASM = win
[1:12:32] <%reddpop_> the best plane cant stop you from crashing in to sea planes
[1:12:32] <third_impact_762> thats litteraly not how any military vehicle works
[1:12:33] <+stolando_florida> Pat would probably be better off attacking the ships in an A10 than what he's doing right now
[1:12:34] <%nofestu2> apatJpeg apatDab apatJpeg apatDab apatJpeg apatDab apatJpeg apatDab
[1:12:34] <+justianxix> Just be super safe
[1:12:34] <privatesargent> get the Su-34, the Fullback is a beast of a ground attack plane
[1:12:35] <%Wallabri> it's ace combat, not ok combat
[1:12:35] <frosctho000> I don't think the plane is the problem
[1:12:36] <gbrincks> Get Su-34
[1:12:37] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat use a multipurpose for this
[1:12:38] <%QueequegTheater> @Gruhunchously He ALSO needs to switch to first person
[1:12:39] <%TRILLTURBAN> use a bomber?
[1:12:39] <%connos_livereview> also doesnt matter when you crash bintch
[1:12:39] <SoaringLettuce> its literally the wrong type of plane!!!!
[1:12:39] <%TheSpiritof2277> you and the plane just aren't compatible
[1:12:45] <+Tadashi047> purple for multi role
[1:12:45] <+valkuma> guys you dont need an attacker plane for this mission you just need to not crash your plane into the nonmoving objects
[1:12:46] <Wingbreaker> Fly glorious SU34 with totally non-warcriminal cluster bombs. Enjoy great success of smashing rigs through the top.
[1:12:49] <tag545> multi bombs for ship is good
[1:12:49] <Latch77> blaming the plane LUL
[1:12:51] <%QueequegTheater> ATTACKER PAT
[1:12:51] <third_impact_762> f-2 f-2 f-2
[1:12:51] <$GrugOfWar> A-10 !!!!!!
[1:12:52] <c_drolet> purple plane = multirole
[1:12:53] <metrying> Youll never be top gun pat
[1:12:54] <Worldbrand> I watched pat's streams after I beat the game and I thought he made the first few missions look easy
[1:12:56] <%nocko_> @AngriestPat BUY THE RAFALE
[1:12:59] <Tucker0603> ATTACKER
[1:12:59] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat try the a10 with rocket pods
[1:13:00] <%Bane_Kaikyo> *flies into eveerthing* .... "Why am I losing?
[1:13:01] <go_aheat_muster_jostur> Elmo can do the assist
[1:13:02] <thelonechris> Not drift compatible
[1:13:02] <SoaringLettuce> dont take anti air missiles thats a waste
[1:13:03] <Gruhunchously> We need to start seeing other planes
[1:13:04] <%Starlight_Gamer> there is almost no wrong plane for this mission
[1:13:06] <$GrugOfWar> Your hitting ground targets
[1:13:08] <third_impact_762> BRRRRRT
[1:13:08] <frosctho000> You forgot to equip your anti crash plane
[1:13:09] <TerraWraith> The plane and being in objects are less compatible
[1:13:09] <supervyxen> USE THE F-4
[1:13:10] <callsigneagle01> Then get something else
[1:13:10] <Worldbrand> Maybe you're going too fast
[1:13:10] <c_drolet> f18
[1:13:13] <%connos_livereview> big agree
[1:13:13] <+dodge_and_dust> TNHAT OS TJE POINT
[1:13:13] <%Iccirrus> just use the Su-33 pat,it's great
[1:13:13] <Grennold> The Gripen with the LACM is good for this
[1:13:14] <%nocko_> @AngriestPat Buy the rafale dude
[1:13:14] <+paladinstarbuster> THATS FINE
[1:13:14] <%AirlineFood74> DON'T use the A1-0
[1:13:15] <callsigneagle01> Gte the F-2A
[1:13:15] <%brave_sj> BRRRT CHAN GOOD GIRL
[1:13:15] <BorkchopSlamwiches> Pat, the A-10 is perfect for this mission with the Rocket special weapon
[1:13:16] <+stolando_florida> You're ALREADY GOING SLOW
[1:13:16] <TheSpartanThief> And hideous too
[1:13:16] <sileo_patronus> You NEED SLOW THOUGH
[1:13:17] <%QueequegTheater> It's literally twice as manueverable
[1:13:17] <gbrincks> Su-34
[1:13:17] <third_impact_762> f-2
[1:13:17] <exalt4747> You know what else is slow, Pat?
[1:13:18] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Just use missles and ditch the laser.
[1:13:18] <callsigneagle01> or the F-18
[1:13:18] <Dingo_Eejit> DIG BAMAGE
[1:13:19] <+justianxix> but the BRRRRTT tho
[1:13:19] <metrying> if you had a faster jet youd die even more
[1:13:20] <%nocko_> you get cruise missles
[1:13:20] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat use the Gripen
[1:13:20] <BorkchopSlamwiches> Just get a plane with the Rockets special weapon
[1:13:23] <privatesargent> @AngriestPat get the Su-34, its a fast ground attack plane
[1:13:24] <+valkuma> you dont need a fucking attack plane for this mission just stop flying directly into the structures
[1:13:24] <%Niney_Who> CHONKY BOI
[1:13:25] <Valdorick> But Pat, you love stupid slow things! Its a Fume Ultra Great Sword of the sky!
[1:13:25] <%TRILLTURBAN> BRRRRRRT
[1:13:26] <supervyxen> Fuck the A-10 use the F-4 with UGB @AngriestPat
[1:13:26] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat then get the SU-34
[1:13:26] <third_impact_762> RKTS!
[1:13:28] <+Tadashi047> f18 for cheap LASMs
[1:13:28] <Worldbrand> You can do a lot of this with missiles and just bombs
[1:13:30] <fluqqer3d> play hockey instead
[1:13:31] <Clundy> Needs more aerial Deja-Vu
[1:13:31] <%DePhat1> but BRRRRRT Pat!
[1:13:32] <Fujiwara_92> YOU NEED SLOW
[1:13:32] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Hasmuffins92) (warning)
[1:13:33] <callsigneagle01> Then get the F-18 or F-2
[1:13:33] <Dingo_Eejit> Cruise missiles?
[1:13:34] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Then continue using the Su-37
[1:13:35] <redsynod> But big farts tho
[1:13:35] <Gruhunchously> At least equip air-to-sea missiles.
[1:13:36] <+drflashylights> I've never used the A10 on this mission, didn't think about that. vineThink
[1:13:36] <The_500lb_Child> Use the A-10 with RKTs and RKT upgrades.
[1:13:37] <$GrugOfWar> Patience Padwan Pat
[1:13:39] <SoaringLettuce> the machine gun will rip the platforms apart on its own pat
[1:13:39] <$Retrocop87> Losing over and over is slower
[1:13:40] <%TheSpiritof2277> it really is, even more than the one your using now... but still BRRRRRT
[1:13:40] <subjectg> Be a man and use the Fishbed
[1:13:40] <Dingo_Eejit> wat?
[1:13:40] <callsigneagle01> Both have Anti-Ship missiles
[1:13:40] <%Iccirrus> Su-33. LASM. DO IR
[1:13:41] <TerraWraith> "I hate the best plane for air-to-ground which is all this mission is."
[1:13:41] <$cureneckbeard> You need to equip springs so when you crash the plane it just boings off
[1:13:43] <%AirlineFood74> Pat you won't 240k from this mission anyway
[1:13:43] <mackumbopus> Use th F-2
[1:13:44] <gbrincks> Then get good on the 37
[1:13:45] <%vectorless_peon> the plane you got is fine just use the laser berrter
[1:13:45] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat You don't have to buy it just use missiles.
[1:13:46] <%nocko_> @AngriestPat the SU-47 is better in every way 35S is for babies
[1:13:47] <%connos_livereview> IT DOESNT MATTER JUST DONT CRASh
[1:13:47] <exalt4747> I bet the 35s would at least work better than this!
[1:13:48] <third_impact_762> F-2
[1:13:48] <$cureneckbeard> Just use the A10
[1:13:49] <c_drolet> youre canadian right? use the f18
[1:13:49] <+justianxix> You can do it pat
[1:13:50] <IminyourBase> the laser is the key!
[1:13:51] <%vectorless_peon> long approaches
[1:13:53] <third_impact_762> F-2 RKTS
[1:13:54] <supervyxen> Rafale sux ass
[1:13:54] <IminyourBase> just use the laser better
[1:13:56] <callsigneagle01> Rafale works
[1:13:56] <%brave_sj> I beat this mission first try with the A-10 because it's super good
[1:13:57] <Angry_Ev1L> Just use gripen lol
[1:13:59] <Grennold> Gripen with LACM, Pat
[1:14:03] <%connos_livereview> FUCK YOU
[1:14:05] <%Nermbert> just be better, haha
[1:14:06] <%nocko_> @AngriestPat you get cruise missles with rafale
[1:14:06] <%Nobrev> pat you need slow right now
[1:14:06] <Grennold> Just need to spend 30k
[1:14:08] <%QueequegTheater> The literal best plane on this page
[1:14:10] <Tucker0603> or ya could use the F-2
[1:14:12] <Worldbrand> I'm pretty sure I just used the mirage for this one lol
[1:14:12] <%connos_livereview> F22 IS best girl
[1:14:13] <%AncelDeLambert> The Gripen is sufficient, Pat
[1:14:14] <exalt4747> ...but Pat in the first part you said you LOVE the f22
[1:14:14] <privatesargent> you don't necesarily need to buy a new plane, you probably have a decent multi-role that has a good ground attack special weapon @AngriestPat
[1:14:16] <+drflashylights> Don't make fun of my Raptor rbzFeels
[1:14:16] <BorkchopSlamwiches> Just get a plane with RKTS.
[1:14:16] <tag545> upgrade laser?
[1:14:17] <%AncelDeLambert> YES YOU CAN
[1:14:17] <third_impact_762> yes it is!
[1:14:18] <supervyxen> F-4 ya dink
[1:14:19] <%QueequegTheater> WRONG

[1:14:21] <privatesargent> thats bias
[1:14:21] <%Starlight_Gamer> yes you can
[1:14:22] <strider3571> pick the gripen it has cruise missles
[1:14:22] <Angry_Ev1L> Gripen is super good LUL
[1:14:23] <%AirlineFood74> WRONG 11111

[1:14:23] <%ooblagis> Oh no
[1:14:24] <sileo_patronus> Like seriously the A-10 being slow is GOOD for this
[1:14:24] <Gruhunchously> WRONG
[1:14:25] <Tucker0603> WRONG
[1:14:25] <%Iccirrus> The Sea Flanker is EXCELLENT for this
[1:14:26] <BorkchopSlamwiches> "It's not as good"< well you're not good. So there.
[1:14:26] <callsigneagle01> It's literally about skill and parts
[1:14:27] <+Bloodxb> pat.
[1:14:27] <%McSnazzyPants> IMAGINE not flying the fishbed

[1:14:30] <%TheSpiritof2277> the Foxhound has godly speed AND fucking pulse lasers
[1:14:30] <%CJett92> Not as good as the plane you keep DYING WITH?
[1:14:30] <%TRILLTURBAN> apatCrazyhead
[1:14:31] <privatesargent> the Terminator is NOT good for ground attack
[1:14:32] <TerraWraith> Ok, Pat, you are actually being stupid here
[1:14:32] <%connos_livereview> and 1
[1:14:32] <%QueequegTheater> LASM
[1:14:33] <%Iccirrus> The loadout is so much better
[1:14:34] <%AirlineFood74> Gripen is amazing
[1:14:34] <loughis> It goes slow! Saves you from yourself maybe.
[1:14:36] <%ooblagis> This is going to be one of those things
[1:14:36] <%QueequegTheater> LASMs PAT
[1:14:36] <%AncelDeLambert> for the WEAPONS
[1:14:39] <Tucker0603> 11111111111111111111111111111
[1:14:40] <%AirlineFood74> IT'S NOT SHITTIER
[1:14:40] <Patzzki217> because of the loadout
[1:14:41] <callsigneagle01> I made a living on dunking dudes in high tier with my F-15C
[1:14:42] <%Starlight_Gamer> all the planes are still viable
[1:14:42] <SoaringLettuce> pat taking a fighter jet to a sea attack thats a knife to a gunfight
[1:14:42] <Worldbrand> It sounds like your problem isn't your stats, it's your speed
[1:14:43] <2butt4face> 1111111111111111111111

[1:14:44] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat LASM for ships.
[1:14:44] <%flagi64> PICK THE GRIPEN (sorry just follwing what chat says)
[1:14:44] <+Tadashi047> for the secondary weapons
[1:14:45] <third_impact_762> DUDE! thats not how it works
[1:14:45] <Fujiwara_92> WAEPONS
[1:14:45] <%HentaiSenpai9K> F22 is so good tho
[1:14:46] <supervyxen> I beat the entire game with the F-4 and F-14 and they wreck shit
[1:14:47] <Bionicghost> WEPON
[1:14:47] <callsigneagle01> cause they got no skiiiiiillll

[1:14:49] <third_impact_762> WEAPONS
[1:14:50] <Gruhunchously> Man who constantly crashes into thing at high speed complains that plane is too slow.
[1:14:50] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Different planes for different missions.
[1:14:51] <%AncelDeLambert> Goblins are awake, goblin alert!!
[1:14:52] <%AirlineFood74> IT HAS CRUISE MISSILES
[1:14:53] <%Niney_Who> Sometimes WORSE is BETTER
[1:14:54] <SoaringLettuce> im losing my shit right now
[1:14:54] <%AJidai> 111111111
[1:14:56] <%Septawn> Different Planes for different roles!
[1:14:56] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat It's not the plane it's the weapons that matter.
[1:14:57] <AMajorTom> Why would you ever use Mario, Luigi jumps higher
[1:14:58] <%flagi64> 1
[1:14:59] <%Niney_Who> 1
[1:15:00] <%QueequegTheater> IT'S A DIFFERENT ROLE

[1:15:01] <%AncelDeLambert> Gobolans!
[1:15:02] <%laserbeaming> LUL
[1:15:02] <+robert_edwards> is this a bit?
[1:15:02] <%connos_livereview> HOW CAN THIS Be
[1:15:02] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Mostly.
[1:15:03] <exalt4747> Just use air to surface missiles or some shit then
[1:15:03] <%QueequegTheater> 1
[1:15:03] <Angry_Ev1L> It has air to ground missiles
[1:15:03] <%McSnazzyPants> @AngriestPat also just note you can use guns/special weap/manually aimed missiles to take out the platform cores, even though they're unmarked, before wiseman does
[1:15:03] <Freyja_Wion> 1
[1:15:04] <mackumbopus> Yeah guys. What if he needs the credits later?
[1:15:05] <%Iccirrus> the weapon loadout matters far more than the stats!
[1:15:05] <%CJett92> BIG 1
[1:15:05] <+justianxix> BIG number is best answer pat
[1:15:06] <Gruhunchously> Derp
[1:15:06] <ShawnEXE> HOW CAN THIS BEEEE

[1:15:08] <+Bloodxb> pat
[1:15:08] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm telling Paige!
[1:15:09] <sileo_patronus> It's almost like different planes are DESIGNED FOR DIFFERENT THINGS
[1:15:09] <go_aheat_muster_jostur> this is painful...
[1:15:09] <%Das_Bass> JET GO UP
[1:15:09] <2butt4face> 1

[1:15:09] <person181> "if number go down i'm not the strongest"
[1:15:10] <supervyxen> @AngriestPat Older planes can have SP weapons new planes don't have therefor it's an advantage
[1:15:10] <lionmanguy> Pat....Pat please
[1:15:10] <+stolando_florida> @AngriestPat try get good
[1:15:10] <%AirlineFood74> MORE WRONG LUL

[1:15:10] <%valriot> HOW CANCTHIS BEEEEE
[1:15:10] <callsigneagle01> You don't get better skill man
[1:15:12] <fluqqer3d> just close your eyes and do it
[1:15:12] <%ThirdWelles> How fucking wrong
[1:15:12] <+Bloodxb> 1
[1:15:13] <%hholmes> I dont think you can pass any balance judgement when you cant keep yourself from plowing into EVERY landmark in sight.
[1:15:13] <%Starlight_Gamer> they make the missions easier
[1:15:14] <fluqqer3d> let go
[1:15:14] <+drflashylights> CrreamAwk Oh
[1:15:15] <redsynod> Its fine
[1:15:15] <+dodge_and_dust> 111
[1:15:15] <%ThirdWelles> can one man be
[1:15:15] <loughis> Pat's fucking with us at this point.
[1:15:16] <%CJett92> How can this BEEEEE??
[1:15:17] <gustavozxd> "why would I go back to Cerberus if Agni and rudra are literally just better" yes Pat
[1:15:17] <c_drolet> that doesnt mean that its worse
[1:15:17] <%brave_sj> Just cheat more money in like you cheated your riot gear in so you can have all the planes Kappa
[1:15:17] <IminyourBase> it's a tree pat the best leaves aren't always at the top!
[1:15:17] <+justianxix> ISN'T Best Answer
[1:15:17] <bleugh> number go up...
[1:15:18] <Weeabooninja> Dig up
[1:15:18] <%Niney_Who> Pat they aren't all STRAIGHT UPGRADES
[1:15:18] <+miguelrod777> THEY ARENT LEVELS
[1:15:18] <SoaringLettuce> pat, youre bad at this game, were better
[1:15:18] <%ThirdWelles> This is like
[1:15:19] <OmegaZaneTheGod> hold on
[1:15:19] <Grennold> Because the LACM is one of the better special weapons for this mission
[1:15:19] <Gruhunchously> This isn't an RPG Pat
[1:15:20] <callsigneagle01> Each plane is a different lady
[1:15:20] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Planes don't do more damage the weapons do.
[1:15:20] <%skizzuto> just because it has a bigger number doesn't mean it's better. utility is a thing
[1:15:21] <%Plague_Nurse> hi gang
[1:15:21] <%Niney_Who> It's SITUATIONAL
[1:15:22] <enlightenedcorgi> So even though it might be better overall some planes may be suited better for different missions.

[1:15:23] <%Mr_Strut> This isn't fucking dragonball, Pat

[1:15:24] <%HentaiSenpai9K> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:15:25] <privatesargent> thats not RIGHT, those planes are the best FIGHTERs not ATTACKERS
[1:15:27] <Grennold> LACM or LASM
[1:15:27] <Dingo_Eejit> It ain't necessarily so
[1:15:28] <%SpcOpsBear> Pat shut up and use the A-10, this is a CAS mission right?
[1:15:28] <mackumbopus> Have you played Rock, Paper, SCissors before?
[1:15:30] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no
[1:15:31] <The_500lb_Child> Where is the FAEB when you need it?
[1:15:31] <OmegaZaneTheGod> guys just hold on
[1:15:32] <%Iccirrus> Su-33 for real though!
[1:15:32] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat It's a TREE. The best leaves aren't at the top
[1:15:32] <callsigneagle01> good lord
[1:15:33] <%HentaiSenpai9K> How can this be?
[1:15:33] <+drflashylights> Is this Crazy Talk happening rn?
[1:15:34] <%Das_Bass> JET GO UUUUUUP
[1:15:34] <gustavozxd> Pat's logic in life is amusing
[1:15:34] <TerraWraith> A plane is a tool. you need the best tool for the job. Each tool does different things.
[1:15:36] <+stolando_florida> @30Karb lul
[1:15:37] <leinadtonu> !uptime
[1:15:37] <%Mr_Strut> Number is not end all and be all of Plane
[1:15:37] <GlockentopHoods> pat, if you keep flying into shit it doesnt matter how good the plane is
[1:15:37] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 15m.
[1:15:39] <+justianxix> LUL
[1:15:39] <supervyxen> UGB
[1:15:39] <KaptainKappathe5th> PAT YOU ARE A CRAZY MAN
[1:15:39] <%Trinity5> Pat, unlike woolie and you, PLANES TIERS ARE NOT BLACK AND WHITE
[1:15:40] <%Niney_Who> OLD???
[1:15:40] <callsigneagle01> Then get the F-2A
[1:15:40] <$cureneckbeard> But the kilogram of steel is heavier
[1:15:41] <%TRILLTURBAN> Ace Combat is not DBZ Pat
[1:15:41] <%timbob> Hey Big Bald Red Baby apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[1:15:42] <SoaringLettuce> youre insane
[1:15:42] <%ThirdWelles> @AngriestPat This is worse than babies not having object permanence
[1:15:42] <%nocko_> @AngriestPat Use the rafale dude
[1:15:42] <%Divryne> BUT THE WEAPONS?!?!?!
[1:15:42] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, there's three colors. The colors have different purposes
[1:15:43] <privatesargent> at least get a good multi-role
[1:15:43] <$cureneckbeard> 1
[1:15:44] <Psyramics> it exists for groundpounding!
[1:15:44] <Angry_Ev1L> GRIPEN
[1:15:45] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@reonome)
[1:15:46] <%wolf34736> not dragonball more like jojo
[1:15:47] <+SimplesRock> Don't you make fun of my BRRRRRTTT
[1:15:47] <+robert_edwards> F18 LASM
[1:15:47] <$GrugOfWar> It's a GROUND Attack Plane!
[1:15:47] <%AncelDeLambert> PAT
[1:15:47] <+Ell1ot> 1
[1:15:48] <Grennold> Believe it bro, the Gripen with the LACM, you will clean up
[1:15:48] <%CJett92> But no tho
[1:15:48] <%topendbuzz> EWWW IT"S OLD
[1:15:49] <SoaringLettuce> soooooo!?
[1:15:49] <%lewdskeletor13> 1
[1:15:50] <cerberuscarmine> PAT
[1:15:50] <%supersugoisenpai1> Pat needs a mecha with drills so he can damage enemies by crashing into them.
[1:15:50] <%Shadowthedigger> Pat think of it like a fighting game.
[1:15:52] <%QueequegTheater> And it's literally the best plane you have available
[1:15:52] <callsigneagle01> They're literally not
[1:15:52] <count_bob> 1
[1:15:54] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat The Gripen is a better ground attacker than the terminator
[1:15:54] <%TheSpiritof2277> depends on the mission from what I understood over time. you've played more AC than me tho, so idk
[1:15:55] <supervyxen> I need a fucking drink
[1:15:56] <cerberuscarmine> 1
[1:15:56] <sileo_patronus> 1
[1:15:56] <%Niney_Who> Really, OLD? It's the BEST Air-to-Ground PLANE
[1:15:56] <OmegaZaneTheGod> don't let go
[1:15:57] <%AJidai> 1
[1:15:58] <TerraWraith> That explains so much about you
[1:15:58] <supervyxen> Pat fly the F-4
[1:15:58] <%Shadowthedigger> Everyone has strengths and weaknesses
[1:15:58] <Gruhunchously> PAAAAaaaaAAAaaaaAAaaT

[1:16:02] <c_drolet> use the f18!
[1:16:02] <LeotheHuntsman> get the american planes
[1:16:02] <%Kazuhira_Boat> HELP CALL THE POLICE
[1:16:03] <%CJett92> Cmon you coward
[1:16:03] <dekkitout> WAKE ME UP
[1:16:04] <strider3571> dont buy the rafale
[1:16:04] <$cureneckbeard> The A-10 is old AND it's still in service. It must be awesome
[1:16:08] <Psyramics> just use the ac-10 to get past this and move on with your life
[1:16:08] <callsigneagle01> Then get the F-18 or F-2A
[1:16:09] <%nocko_> @AngriestPat YOU GET CRUISE MISSLES DUDES
[1:16:09] <%Feralspirit41> except that plane is designed for this type of mission
[1:16:10] <%Niney_Who> A-10 IS A BEAST
[1:16:10] <%AncelDeLambert> Stop buying blue!
[1:16:10] <+Ell1ot> Before you gogo
[1:16:11] <callsigneagle01> good lord
[1:16:11] <%Starlight_Gamer> there isn't a tier level system, just plane specialties
[1:16:12] <sileo_patronus> Just use the A-10 and watch yourself win
[1:16:12] <SoaringLettuce> why arent you winning then?
[1:16:12] <Tucker0603> JUST GET THE SU34!
[1:16:13] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Just use an old plane with LASM.
[1:16:15] <Themightymightyena> Boo commie planes
[1:16:15] <supervyxen> pat fly the fucking f-4 and equip it with ugb
[1:16:16] <SirDogBear> just play some multiplayer to get more points and then you can get everything
[1:16:17] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat try the A-10 with RKT come on just try it
[1:16:17] <%nocko_> RAFALE NOW
[1:16:17] <+Krivvan> the SU-34 to bomb everything from above
[1:16:18] <+SimplesRock> if it
[1:16:18] <%Nermbert> you did it with this plane last time but died at the end
[1:16:18] <%Daxalog> Keep the plane you have just dont crash
[1:16:19] <Grennold> The Gripen with the LACM will do the job easy
[1:16:19] <mackumbopus> What if he needs it later?
[1:16:19] <Dingo_Eejit> <dessage meleted>
[1:16:19] <gbrincks> Get the 34
[1:16:19] <Angry_Ev1L> @AngriestPat just use gripen already it's cute lol
[1:16:20] <strider3571> GRIPEN
[1:16:20] <%ooblagis> Use an old plane that you already have
[1:16:21] <%AirlineFood74> Don't get the raf you have the gripen
[1:16:22] <%Nobrev> @AngriestPat some planes are better in certain situations just because a plane is higher tier doesn't mean it's not useful in situations it's specialized for
[1:16:23] <Worldbrand> You can do this with a pretty shitty plane tbh
[1:16:24] <%Ozymandias555> @AngriestPat roles matter more. Planes fill niches. More stats doesn't mean better. Ace Combat is not DBZ, it's Jojo
[1:16:24] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Use the Su-37 until you're good at flying with it
[1:16:24] <leinadtonu> Heyz where is Marge?
[1:16:26] <callsigneagle01> F-18 literally has missiles designed to kill ships
[1:16:26] <Flunkorg> Pat, you can do this mission easy with just normal rockets.
[1:16:28] <%Iccirrus> SEA FLANKER
[1:16:30] <+mobius_one> how dare you bully the A-10
[1:16:31] <rytisone> zeppelin bomber
[1:16:33] <%Iccirrus> YES
[1:16:34] <%Iccirrus> DO IT
[1:16:34] <%Starlight_Gamer> beat the mission with the gripen
[1:16:34] <%AncelDeLambert> this is the most goblins that have ever goblined
[1:16:34] <SoaringLettuce> the f4 with the ugb is a fucking shotgun pat
[1:16:35] <+SimplesRock> if it's like the old games, the A10 has the most firepower by far (slots for missiles and all that)
[1:16:40] <Gruhunchously> A10 is best girl
[1:16:40] <TerraWraith> You can use the SU-37, just stop running into everything
[1:16:40] <%CJett92> Use the SUK-4ME
[1:16:41] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Or LACM.
[1:16:45] <%connos_livereview> short ginger gets dunked on by physics part 2
[1:16:45] <%ooblagis> The 31B with the PLSL is really good at this mission
[1:16:46] <SoaringLettuce> shotgun the platform
[1:16:47] <+SimplesRock> but it may have changed in this one. 22 I'm sure is baller
[1:16:47] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat Pat using a Nuke for an Ant isn't smart. That's what you're doing right now, the planes are Situational. A-10 is Amazing
[1:16:50] <tag545> @AngriestPat the planes on the right are better but it doesn't matter if their weapons aren't good for the mission. bombs good now
[1:16:54] <Angry_Ev1L> Russian planes skill floor is too high for Pat LUL
[1:16:55] <The_500lb_Child> RKTs is the easiest. Dont need to attack from the center. just fire ontop. but you need the upgrades.
[1:16:56] <%AncelDeLambert> the Mirage is sufficient, Pat, just use that
[1:16:57] <c_drolet> lasm
[1:16:57] <+Tadashi047> LASMS
[1:16:58] <callsigneagle01> LASM
[1:17:00] <%Iccirrus> YESSS
[1:17:01] <supervyxen> UGB
[1:17:02] <%QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:17:03] <Grennold> yeah, LACM
[1:17:03] <%Iccirrus> DO IIIIIT
[1:17:04] <+drflashylights> cruise missile for ships yea
[1:17:04] <Dingo_Eejit> Get the GUN with the big shooty plane
[1:17:07] <Gray_skies1993> @AngriestPat you actually were doing fine with your current plane, you just need to stop running into stuff
[1:17:09] <callsigneagle01> Literally meant to kill ships
[1:17:12] <OmegaZaneTheGod> Not flying into stuff? is this magic?
[1:17:17] <%MelBrooksKA> @cureneckbeard To be fair, that's mostly because no one the US fights has any good anti-air
[1:17:17] <+justianxix> dO NOT nuke THE ANT
[1:17:18] <%ooblagis> 31B PLSL is good enough for any mission
[1:17:18] <Freyja_Wion> TRY GRIPEN
[1:17:21] <callsigneagle01> F-18 has LASM
[1:17:22] <+Tadashi047> F18 has them
[1:17:25] <strider3571> pick the f18
[1:17:25] <SirDogBear> but there are a lot of ants though...
[1:17:26] <Fujiwara_92> LASM
[1:17:27] <+stolando_florida> Ants are awful and shitty, nuke them
[1:17:27] <+dodge_and_dust> don't use that nuke example. in his mind that means his nuke SHOULD work for the ant
[1:17:27] <mackumbopus> Rockets are best girl.
[1:17:27] <%topendbuzz> oof
[1:17:27] <%QueequegTheater> F18 pat
[1:17:29] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat you don't need to buy a new play. the Gripen's Cruise missiles and use those
[1:17:31] <gustavozxd> that's a pretty good analogy tbh

[1:18:45] <%Iccirrus> The stats don't mean much
[1:18:45] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @AngriestPat The SP weapons of the planes that are suited for that role will help you out a lot more than the stats of planes that aren't suited for the thing you're trying to do

[1:22:28] <%LogothX> Use a flamethrower to make a grilled cheese
[1:22:28] <+mugwugsampoo> gachiBASS
[1:22:28] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat There you go halfway done.
[1:22:30] <%skizzuto> no object is the best at everything
[1:22:35] <%bigboy3d> cheep cheep cheeeep!
[1:22:35] <$Big_King_Coconut> chirp chirp chirp little chick!
[1:22:36] <%Starlight_Gamer> now destroy the platforms
[1:22:38] <KaptainKappathe5th> pat would use a chainsaw to slaughter a pig
[1:22:38] <Ion_LaserX> NotLikeThis
[1:22:38] <+paladinstarbuster> no it doesnt
[1:22:38] <dekkitout> Objects? How the hell do they work?
[1:22:42] <rytisone> Pat is so smart for using this plane
[1:22:48] <%cyberdeathkitty> but you are using the wrong tool for the job. you don't chop a tree down with a hammer
[1:22:49] <%Nobrev> yeah use the better object. like this weapon that excels in taking down ships instead of the faster plane
[1:22:51] <%Niney_Who> Pat can't comprehend it
[1:22:54] <IminyourBase> so then is it worse!?!?
[1:22:54] <ShichiNoBushi> What good is covering a rock with paper?
[1:22:55] <lionmanguy> How can this beeeee!
[1:22:55] <layssaltflavor> first time when he trolls like this is actually frustrating in the not charming way
[1:22:56] <+justianxix> We need Paige NotLikeThis
[1:22:56] <%Niney_Who> He literally cannot understand
[1:22:56] <callsigneagle01> Can we at least hear that stats don't matter that much?
[1:22:59] <%QueequegTheater> Pat plays too many RPGs
[1:23:01] <cerberuscarmine> x.x
[1:23:02] <%LogothX> He knows, he just refuses to admit it.
[1:23:02] <%TRILLTURBAN> @angriestpat Pat imagine the shears are bigger than the sheet of paper you are cutting, would it be suited for making small cuts?
[1:23:02] <gbrincks> 'Cuz you're not crashing
[1:23:02] <+d00msdaydan> but steel is heavier than feathers
[1:23:04] <%connos_livereview> someone message paige to come collect her mans
[1:23:04] <%Das_Bass> CLASSIC PAT
[1:23:05] <%topendbuzz> BEACUSE LOADOUT PAT
[1:23:05] <tag545> weapon is more important than plane
[1:23:06] <sileo_patronus> Because the weapons are BETTER SUITED
[1:23:06] <Fujiwara_92> he's fucking with ppl LUL
[1:23:07] <privatesargent> do the LACM even work on the cores though?
[1:23:07] <Dingo_Eejit> Not worse... DIFFERENT
[1:23:09] <%SpcOpsBear> The best tool for a specific job is not always the objectively best tool available.
[1:23:09] <+dodge_and_dust> Pat.exe has encountered a critical error
[1:23:09] <%HentaiSenpai9K> OmG Pat apatFist NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:23:09] <%hholmes> okay this has to be a bit at this point, you cant be THAT dense
[1:23:09] <SoaringLettuce> pat is gonna beat this mission and keep thinking this shit xD
[1:23:11] <%supersugoisenpai1> Less speed means the ground comes at you slower
[1:23:12] <%BlueMoonBlues> Local Canadian man just doesn't understand
[1:23:14] <OmegaZaneTheGod> @cyberdeathkitty what if it's a really good hammer tho?
[1:23:14] <%TenderBabyBacon> It's like using a bomb to shoot a plane, shit just doesn't work as well
[1:23:16] <Dingo_Eejit> like Paige
[1:23:20] <%Feralspirit41> Pats just now learning a strategy thats been prevalent everywhere but hes never heard of
[1:23:21] <%skizzuto> did Pat drink the Paige sundown juice today
[1:23:25] <+Gohyakuen> the concept of a bomber must be so laien to pat
[1:23:27] <%Iccirrus> don't forget that you can fly back and restock
[1:23:28] <TerraWraith> @AngriestPat Which is the better fruit, apples or oranges? Not which one you like more, but which one is better?
[1:23:28] <%radda343> pat would use use a gun to carve wood? different planes have different applications
[1:23:29] <exalt4747> He was literally using an anti-plane plane before to fight grounded targets, and now he's using a multirole with a ATS weapon.
[1:23:29] <c_drolet> lets face it this is why we watch this shit
[1:23:30] <callsigneagle01> It's not worse
[1:23:31] <%Niney_Who> But it's TECHNICALLY BETTER
[1:23:31] <Tucker0603> AC7 USED LOGIC! Pat HAS BECOME CONFUSED!!!
[1:23:32] <mackumbopus> "You need to use specific planes for specific types of missions" - "But the stats are shit"
[1:23:32] <callsigneagle01> It's different
[1:23:32] <exalt4747> And he doesn't get it
[1:23:33] <+Ell1ot> Pat would cut a small steak with a Claymore instead of a steak knife because the stats are better
[1:23:34] <%Niney_Who> Because it's SITUATIONAL
[1:23:36] <%LogothX> Sunnydown D
[1:23:38] <+miguelrod777> steel is heavier than feathers
[1:23:39] <cerberuscarmine> pat cant handle the truth
[1:23:40] <+drflashylights> Should someone tell pat that frigates don't have CIWs and can be taken down with two missiles? vineThink
[1:23:41] <%MelBrooksKA> Guys, he's fucking with you
[1:23:46] <%Nobrev> @AngriestPat i swear to god you're doing this on purpose now
[1:23:47] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @AngriestPat SP weapons that are specifically for what you're trying to do will help you a lot more than stats of planes that aren't suited for it
[1:23:47] <changtasia> "Failure is funny." - Pat, probably
[1:23:48] <sileo_patronus> At this point he has to be fucking with us. Tell me he's fucking with us
[1:23:48] <tag545> ammunition 0. now the plane is worse
[1:23:50] <%QueequegTheater> @drflashylights No
[1:23:50] <Fujiwara_92> IT'S BETTER FOR THIS SITUATION THO l
[1:23:51] <TheSpartanThief> "It's way worse" he says as the fact he was wrong rattles in his mind like aloose bolt.
[1:23:51] <callsigneagle01> I got a friend who wrecks people in just a tricked out Fishbed. It's half the plane and half the pilot
[1:23:51] <Gruhunchously> This is why it took so long for Canada to be added to Civilizations.
[1:23:54] <%FrostMass22> The aspartame is melting Pat's brain faster than previously expected
[1:23:56] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> he is doing this on purpose
[1:23:59] <%Starlight_Gamer> anybody tried beating this mission with the f-16?
[1:24:00] <Valdorick> The sea planes are dead
[1:24:00] <%topendbuzz> the planes
[1:24:01] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> he has to be
[1:24:03] <+drflashylights> @QueequegTheater fair enough LUL
[1:24:03] <Worldbrand> @MelBrooksKA I thought so too, but he's really milking it
[1:24:04] <%Iccirrus> go get more ammo!
[1:24:05] <Grennold> It's OK guys he's just pretending to be DSP 4Head
[1:24:06] <SoaringLettuce> you dont use a plane meant to kill planes to kill buildings and boats!!!
[1:24:07] <privatesargent> now the hard part, the cores
[1:24:08] <The_500lb_Child> Who knew a anti-ground missiles can do so well against ground units?
[1:24:11] <callsigneagle01> @Starlight_Gamer yeah, totally possible
[1:24:12] <%QueequegTheater> Look at how fast his points went up
[1:24:16] <%galaxyswirl> "which weighs more, 10 kilos of feathers, or 10 kilos of iron... correct, the iron is heavier" -angriestPAT
[1:24:18] <leinadtonu> Extreme prejudice those planes!
[1:24:26] <Angry_Ev1L> @AngriestPat you can resupply your special weapons if you want
[1:24:26] <Tucker0603> Pat's brain has ceased it's function
[1:24:29] <%MelBrooksKA> @Worldbrand It's Pat
[1:24:31] <Worldbrand> Targeting the cores helps for those
[1:24:31] <+Thorlias> it's almost as if the planes type and armament make a difference. barrThunk
[1:24:33] <%Niney_Who> This BOAT?
[1:24:34] <IminyourBase> this boat sucks
[1:24:34] <+paladinstarbuster> air boat
[1:24:36] <SoaringLettuce> stop going at an angle jesus
[1:24:37] <tag545> ah the air boat
[1:24:38] <%QueequegTheater> Please stop trying to scrape the ground Pat
[1:24:40] <%TenderBabyBacon> Sky boat is good
[1:24:41] <%topendbuzz> boat???????
[1:24:42] <cerberuscarmine> too much redbull has rotted pats mind
[1:24:42] <%connos_livereview> remember you ONLY need to hit score so you can LAME IT OUT when you do
[1:24:42] <Fujiwara_92> bote sucos?
[1:24:44] <Toxic_Phazon> He's fucking with us right?
[1:24:45] <%Laecerelius> Pat loves his sky boat
[1:24:45] <IminyourBase> water planes and air boats
[1:24:50] <%ooblagis> Pat, the corners have giant pillars, you can't shoot through them
[1:24:50] <%TRILLTURBAN> Don't bully the sky boat
[1:24:51] <Gruhunchously> Watching Pat slowly lose him imind is kind of depressing.
[1:24:51] <%Feralspirit41> air boat is best boat
[1:24:53] <TerraWraith> FUCKIN THING SUCKS! We'll do it live
[1:24:53] <layssaltflavor> we gotta tell pat that mobility wont matter if he cant use it good
[1:24:53] <%LogothX> Don't forget flares pat, hit both thumbsticks to deploy them.
[1:24:53] <%CJett92> Man what a GARBAGE plane, why is it even in the game......
[1:24:54] <%topendbuzz> sea planes and sky boats
[1:24:56] <%TRILLTURBAN> ⛵
[1:24:59] <%Finalknightmare> You can CHANGE special weapons
[1:25:00] <%brave_sj> If only you had a 30mm hydraulically driven seven-barrel Gatling-type cannon Kappa
[1:25:03] <Angry_Ev1L> superior EU planes btw LUL
[1:25:04] <gbrincks> Tunnel run!
[1:25:04] <privatesargent> would the LACM even hit the core? i don't think the missile arc would allow it to hit
[1:25:06] <+d00msdaydan> more like make like trigger and serve up a sandwich
[1:25:08] <+stolando_florida> I can't wait for Pat to nosedive into the water.
[1:25:12] <%Iccirrus> I give it 45 seconds before pat eats shit again
[1:25:18] <Gray_skies1993> ^
[1:25:20] <%connos_livereview> jets are just sky SPEED BOATS
[1:25:23] <+dodge_and_dust> fuck! now i want a burger
[1:25:23] <+paladinstarbuster> bolth
[1:25:23] <Gruhunchously> Don't do the thing you did last time

[1:25:27] <TerraWraith> @Iccirrus That's generous
[1:25:28] <%brave_sj> missile
[1:25:29] <Tucker0603> @brave_sj I know right?
[1:25:30] <IminyourBase> pat becomes the missile in 10
[1:25:36] <Nighthawkmun> Is this a repeat of the last AC7 strem?
[1:25:36] <SoaringLettuce> destroy the machine guns
[1:25:37] <callsigneagle01> I swear I made a career in multi from shooting down high tier players in an F-15C cause they can't fly well enough
[1:25:38] <%Niney_Who> LUL
[1:25:40] <+drflashylights> @stolando_florida I had my fill of that when pat ate shit for the past hour
[1:25:41] <%LogothX> Stop trolling Pat
[1:25:42] <%QueequegTheater> No it wasnt
[1:25:42] <callsigneagle01> It's NOT THAT BETTER
[1:25:43] <tag545> this weapon is better
[1:25:44] <cerberuscarmine> HOW
[1:25:45] <%CJett92> But its not better tho
[1:25:45] <Chaoko99> PAT
[1:25:45] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Angry_Ev1L) (warning)
[1:25:46] <Gruhunchously> I'm not surprised honestly
[1:25:46] <Fujiwara_92> sure LUL
[1:25:46] <lionmanguy> It's okay pat, just play the video game
[1:25:47] <+justianxix> Accept reality
[1:25:47] <sileo_patronus> It WASN'T THOUGH
[1:25:48] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat This one has a better loadout.
[1:25:48] <Tucker0603> no it wasnt
[1:25:48] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> There's a Mister X in this too?!
[1:25:49] <%connos_livereview> JUST do combo
[1:25:54] <%Das_Bass> lol
[1:25:54] <%supersugoisenpai1> For air to air it was
[1:25:55] <%AmericanaRed> whens Airplane BATTLE ROYALE?
[1:25:55] <Worldbrand> better at crashing amirite
[1:25:56] <+Gohyakuen> he must be messing with us
[1:25:57] <%Nobrev> the plane was better but its weapons were worse @AngriestPat
[1:25:59] <%BlueMoonBlues> I never realized there's a Mister X in this game too
[1:25:59] <exalt4747> I hope Pat dies in real life to a SAM.
[1:26:00] <+Lordgale119> pat for fuck's sake, "better" doesn't mean "better suited"
[1:26:01] <layssaltflavor> the mig 21 is the best plane with gunpods what now
[1:26:01] <%Iccirrus> @AngriestPat The Terminator has higher stats,and a better A2A loadout, but it has a garbage loadout for A2G
[1:26:02] <%CJett92> PAT NO
[1:26:02] <%EdgyMacaroon> Not for this mission
[1:26:02] <SoaringLettuce> you play rpgs? start mititgating damage by destorying the aa guns
[1:26:03] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat For this mission.
[1:26:05] <%R0bobot> Oh man, what's Pat gonna say when he finds out the Mig-21 is top tier.
[1:26:05] <Angry_Ev1L> fuck you moobot jeez
[1:26:06] <bleugh> bigger numberer
[1:26:06] <%QueequegTheater> Those statsare DS1 resistance
[1:26:06] <+Krivvan> @AngriestPat: The stats in this game also lie to you
[1:26:07] <Gruhunchously> Big stats
[1:26:07] <c_drolet> its like trying to tow a trailer with a racecar
[1:26:08] <SirDogBear> this plane has the power of friendship though
[1:26:09] <+Gohyakuen> no one can be this nuts
[1:26:09] <Halospaz117> The gripen looks way cool pat
[1:26:09] <%McSnazzyPants> you guys know he's fucking with you right
[1:26:10] <GlockentopHoods> this is the worst argument ever
[1:26:10] <cerberuscarmine> ....
[1:26:11] <reonome> pat just because something has better stats doesn't mean its better
[1:26:11] <callsigneagle01> It was good for air-to-air, and you kept crashing man
[1:26:11] <+Lordgale119> stats mean fuck all in a game about piloting skill
[1:26:12] <%Feralspirit41> The plane had better stats but wasnt designed to fight boats
[1:26:12] <%TRILLTURBAN> "it looked cooler"
[1:26:12] <KaptainKappathe5th> pat you actual fucking child
[1:26:13] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat It's a better dogfighter, not a better ground attacker
[1:26:14] <supervyxen> @AngriestPat The plane is BETTER, but the SP weapons available were different. This plane is more USEFUL for this mission.
[1:26:14] <%HentaiSenpai9K> The plane was better not the loadout
[1:26:14] <%TheSpiritof2277> HIS NUMBER IS POWERFUL
[1:26:14] <+IrritatedAvian> Fashion Souls!
[1:26:14] <%FrostMass22> Pat loves power levels in Dragonball CONFIRMED
[1:26:14] <IminyourBase> how can one man be so wrong?
[1:26:14] <sileo_patronus> It had better stats for DOGFIGHTING
[1:26:15] <$cureneckbeard> But a kilogram of feathers weighs more!
[1:26:15] <%SpcOpsBear> The other plane was better at fighting other planes, not destroying static emplacements. The bigger stats don't make it better for the role it was designed for, which didn't fit the role of the mission.
[1:26:15] <rytisone> ! CONFUSED !
[1:26:15] <+drflashylights> Big numbers means big good
[1:26:16] <artoflec> the number was bigger BabyRage
[1:26:16] <%sshen> Does pat use a guillotine to slice cheese because it’s bigger?
[1:26:17] <Arweynn> THiS ISNT DRAGONBALL PAT
[1:26:17] <lionmanguy> It's alright pat just play the video game and look pretty, we aren't here for your smarts
[1:26:17] <%topendbuzz> IT LOOKED COOL GUYS
[1:26:17] <+d00msdaydan> this HAS to be a bit
[1:26:18] <hntronium> Pat stop trolling
[1:26:19] <aimlesshealer> Da red ones go fasta
[1:26:19] <%st4rrytea> and how many times have you crashed with this plane
[1:26:20] <Fujiwara_92> looks cooler= better Kappa
[1:26:20] <+justianxix> Cooler, yes stats? DOESN'T MATTER
[1:26:22] <Angry_Ev1L> gripen is cute shut up LUL
[1:26:23] <%Das_Bass> STATS GO UP
[1:26:24] <Valdorick> Okay, yes, against other planes, the other plane was better - but when fast plane is fast and dies because it runs into things, its no longer better. Its the MMO DPS motto - Dead DPS is 0 DPS
[1:26:24] <%Niney_Who> A monster Truck wouldn't win a RACE against Formula 1 Cars, Pat
[1:26:25] <%ooblagis> @AngriestPat If you had to drive a car RIGHT now, would you be better driving a family sedan, or an F-1 Drag Racer?
[1:26:26] <%Kazuhira_Boat> Hes just fucking us now fuck
[1:26:26] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat it's better at doing a thing that isn't it
[1:26:26] <shevan123> pat you're not acting like a fighter pilot
[1:26:30] <%Ahack13> I legit don't know if he's trolling
[1:26:30] <%Blankets_and_Tea> you can't min/max ace combat
[1:26:30] <%SpcOpsBear> You DO NOT bring a stealth fighter for a CAS run.
[1:26:31] <%connos_livereview> leave jiren to me
[1:26:31] <+miguelrod777> STEEL IS HEAVIER
[1:26:32] <The_500lb_Child> Planes are just vehicles for the Weapons. the Weapons are the ones that does the work.
[1:26:32] <%CJett92> I dont even know how to explain this more than we already have
[1:26:33] <%Feralspirit41> Like trying to cut burnt steak with a butter knife
[1:26:33] <+DrPoxx> I guess it was too much plans for you?
[1:26:34] <%Aitch971> Bombers are better at bombing, fighters are better at fighting @AngriestPat
[1:26:35] <tag545> @AngriestPat planes WEAPON > plane with more stats
[1:26:35] <chancho4tierra> IT LOOKED COOL
[1:26:37] <TheSpartanThief> Pat, what is the best Street Fighter? "V, it's more newer"
[1:26:37] <SoaringLettuce> gripen is so much cooler looking
[1:26:38] <%SpcOpsBear> Unless that fighter is a multi-role fighter.
[1:26:38] <DirtyPopcornJ> Welcome to Ace Combat where everything is made up and the stats don't matter
[1:26:41] <%HentaiSenpai9K> Think RPG CLASSES L/JOBS
[1:26:43] <%AirlineFood74> You were bringing a stealth fighter to a CAS run
[1:26:45] <%Niney_Who> You'd die
[1:26:46] <thelonechris> Ok
[1:26:48] <+drflashylights> LUL
[1:26:48] <dekkitout> Pat, you watch/read Jojo, how are you saying this shit!?!
[1:26:49] <%luckysteak> coolness is the strongest stat
[1:26:49] <%QueequegTheater> He's fucking with us
[1:26:50] <+Lordgale119> pat is the "steel is heavier than feathers" guy
[1:26:50] <Halospaz117> What about the speed limit tho!
[1:26:50] <%MelBrooksKA> Pat can't drive
[1:26:50] <Valdorick> Its number is huge
[1:26:51] <%TheSpiritof2277> SU-37 is so powerful stat-wise it can stop time
[1:26:51] <Gray_skies1993> FailFIsh
[1:26:51] <cerberuscarmine> why
[1:26:51] <+justianxix> But do you need one?
[1:26:52] <%AncelDeLambert> not on a city street it's not
[1:26:52] <Nighthawkmun> Jeep
[1:26:52] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[1:26:52] <%Kazuhira_Boat> Kill me
[1:26:53] <%InsaneJackLondon> LUL
[1:26:54] <+Thorlias> NOT for this scenario it isnt
[1:26:54] <SpaceGuntank> just let the man fly his fancy planes
[1:26:54] <layssaltflavor> you would literally die lmao
[1:26:55] <RadamirRed> Nevan Is a better weapon than Cerberus because you get it later
[1:26:56] <KaptainKappathe5th> alright he has to be trolling
[1:26:57] <leinadtonu> A higher DPS isn't a good tank tho.
[1:26:57] <SoaringLettuce> and youd crash
[1:26:57] <exalt4747> Cars are not war machines
[1:26:58] <%FrostMass22> Pat doesn't have a license
[1:26:59] <+miguelrod777> hes fucking with us
[1:27:04] <reonome> I can't tell if he's fucking with us
[1:27:04] <privatesargent> @AngriestPat the problem with that thought is the bigger stats don't increase your DAMAGE, only your maneuverabily, and damage was the problem
[1:27:06] <%galaxyswirl> XD
[1:27:09] <%AncelDeLambert> then it's not faster
[1:27:12] <+paladinstarbuster> Stop engaging him chat he's trolling
[1:27:13] <%CJett92> @Lordgale119 Thats the image I had in my head this whole time
[1:27:14] <dekkitout> @exalt4747 Tell that to the IRA
[1:27:15] <Valdorick> You don't get it, in his MIND, he knows the number is bigger
[1:27:15] <c_drolet> f1 cars cant drive below the speed limit
[1:27:15] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat Neven is a better weapon than Cerberus because you get it later
[1:27:15] <%connos_livereview> doesnt work like that
[1:27:17] <%AmericanaRed> cmonBruh cmonBruh cmonBruh
[1:27:18] <%Yokuho> This discussion is as pointless as it gets
[1:27:19] <%Aitch971> Bombers are better at bombing, fighters are better at fighting @AngriestPat
[1:27:20] <%TRILLTURBAN> BUT
[1:27:22] <Gruhunchously> What's the point of having an F1 if you can't go over the speed limit?
[1:27:22] <reonome> pat is actuallly insane
[1:27:23] <%Iccirrus> next time he dies I'm just going to boot the game and yeet this mission on ace
[1:27:24] <Nighthawkmun> Get a jeep
[1:27:24] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat Technically your bigger stats don't determine damage, your weapons do. This plane had better weapons.
[1:27:24] <c_drolet> not enough grip
[1:27:26] <The_500lb_Child> but then what happens if you have a family that needs to be transported?
[1:27:26] <%QueequegTheater> Spiral is a better gun than Coyote-A because it do more damage
[1:27:27] <%R0bobot> What about Canadian AirForce trying to stop you
[1:27:28] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat what if the sedan had heated seats?
[1:27:29] <%AncelDeLambert> this is such a short guy thing
[1:27:29] <Worldbrand> Driving an F1 on the icy streets of montreal lol
[1:27:30] <Gray_skies1993> oh god Pat is in troll mode NotLikeThis
[1:27:30] <+dodge_and_dust> Pat. your facing a horde of zombies in RE2 and you ahve to choose between two MAG rounds and the amount of shotgun ammo that does one shot less damage then those two MAG rounds. which would you choose?
[1:27:31] <$cureneckbeard> Strong planes. Weak planes. That is only the selfish perception of people. Truly skilled pilots should try to win with their favorites. nyannDab
[1:27:32] <%CJett92> But the one that goes 200 also has shit brakes
[1:27:33] <%FrostMass22> It doesn't matter how fast a car can go because you'll NEVER be able to go that fast
[1:27:34] <TheBlankAce> He got too deep into the character and just became this mess
[1:27:34] <Toxic_Phazon> Even if the handling is bad Pat?
[1:27:36] <privatesargent> i hate that fucked up thinking
[1:27:37] <%Shadowthedigger> 1
[1:27:40] <SoaringLettuce> the f1 would smash at the first speedbump pat
[1:27:40] <thelonechris> But then you'd just look like a little man going slow in a racecar
[1:27:41] <+justianxix> in Canada?
[1:27:41] <%Bane_Kaikyo> 1
[1:27:42] <%Nobrev> 1
[1:27:42] <%HentaiSenpai9K> Is the 100mph car more solid tho?
[1:27:42] <+Hasmuffins92> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[1:27:43] <Raishiro> you'd also spend 10x more on the faster car
[1:27:43] <%connos_livereview> pat stop joshing us you old man
[1:27:43] <KaptainKappathe5th> 1
[1:27:46] <%skizzuto> are there even tornadoes in montreal?

[1:27:47] <cerberuscarmine> 1
[1:27:47] <chancho4tierra> the argument sucks pat you need weapons in this game
[1:27:47] <TerraWraith> 200 MPH is always over the speed limit. You would never need it
[1:27:48] <Raishiro> both in price and maintenance
[1:27:48] <saint_george> are fucking with us?
[1:27:49] <Tucker0603> 11111111111111111111111111
[1:27:49] <tag545> its ok you are still pat
[1:27:50] <%Yokuho> Do you need a coathanger to abort this conversation or what?
[1:27:50] <%TheSpiritof2277> Canadian tornadoes
[1:27:50] <%brave_sj> @AngriestPat Remember that this is basically a plane anime, animes are constantly going on about how strength isn't as important as friendship and/or determination. This plane works better because it believes in itself.
[1:27:52] <%Feralspirit41> Im getting to tired to try and reason with him
[1:27:52] <%SirFailsAlott> @AngriestPat tornadoes move slow pat
[1:27:52] <bleugh> what if you had to take paige to the hospital with it but it only has 1 seat
[1:27:53] <dekkitout> Nice Circle Talk
[1:27:54] <IminyourBase> yeah but that fast car comes with no good attachments
[1:27:55] <Nighthawkmun> 3333333333
[1:27:55] <callsigneagle01> Can someone tweet him some multiplayer videos of players in MiG-21s with gunpods wrecking people?
[1:27:56] <+Ell1ot> then why don't you go half the speed with your good plane?
[1:27:58] <televisedrevolt> I'm slamming my fists into my forehead.
[1:27:58] <rytisone> you need drivers lisence first
[1:27:59] <%Mr_Strut> In Canada?
[1:28:02] <%topendbuzz> 111111
[1:28:02] <leinadtonu> what if you need to rescue 8 people from the tornado?
[1:28:03] <Dingo_Eejit> Sometimes a doorman is better than a secretary. Unless it's SUPER CHUNK
[1:28:03] <%BlueMoonBlues> @AngriestPat is Spiral better than Coyote-A because it does more damage?
[1:28:03] <DirtyPopcornJ> Spite pat spites his way into the brawl
[1:28:03] <The_Blumper> A tornado in cananda?
[1:28:04] <%violetheart> @AngriestPat Does a greatsword have better stats than a steak knife? Which'd you use to cut a steak?
[1:28:07] <The_500lb_Child> This is why I sub to WoolieVS because he has the better stats.
[1:28:08] <+stolando_florida> >implying Pat would ever drive
[1:28:08] <%galaxyswirl> this is to be a prank, he cant be this serious about this
[1:28:10] <exalt4747> So if there were like, a super duper bomber, would Pat use it against planes?
[1:28:12] <%connos_livereview> helen HUNT did it in a pickup
[1:28:14] <%R0bobot> Why does pat always turn back vertically?
[1:28:17] <Grennold> The entire Erusean Navy is getting fucked up by one squadron LuL
[1:28:18] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> If I buy the most expensive thing it will obviously be the best
[1:28:18] <%Mr_Strut> You don't live in Kansas, Pat.
[1:28:20] <nzrai> pat onegai
[1:28:25] <Mullet_Warrior> In a tornado I'd go for a higher safety rating Kappa
[1:28:26] <%brickwall35> Guys Pat is serious, he's this bad about DbD stuff too
[1:28:29] <Worldbrand> pat HATES getting shot at

[1:28:33] <%HentaiSenpai9K> @angriestpat What if the the 100mph car is safer tho and last longer?
[1:28:33] <SoaringLettuce> the f1 is so low to the ground you couldnt deal with asphalt irregularities
[1:28:35] <%connos_livereview> nothing
[1:28:35] <+Gohyakuen> lose what?
[1:28:35] <%Niney_Who> ???
[1:28:36] <reonome> I think I know why pat can't drive
[1:28:37] <%Mr_Strut> oh...
[1:28:38] <+Krivvan> turning back vertically is good though
[1:28:40] <%AirlineFood74> LOSE WHAT PAT
[1:28:40] <Chaoko99> what is gravity
[1:28:40] <Valdorick> Oh god, the words of fear "Okay, hang on". MISSION RESTART SOON!?
[1:28:41] <Videogamer4> NotLikeThis

[1:28:43] <layssaltflavor> use high g turn any where dude lmao
[1:28:45] <%QueequegTheater> @Gohyakuen Angle of approach
[1:28:46] <%ElenaManetta> that makes me more likely to throw up tho
[1:28:46] <CrimsonFox777> Pat admits that he was wrong?!
[1:28:47] <+ninebreaker6> speed
[1:28:48] <%luckysteak> oh pat, you never cease to amuse
[1:28:49] <%brickwall35> CRAZY TALK
[1:28:50] <DirtyPopcornJ> He did it for cool points
[1:28:50] <SirDogBear> its like star wars pat, why does the resistance need fancy new star fighters when they got x-wings
[1:28:51] <exalt4747> @Grennold yeah that's how this goes. In Valkyria chronicles, one squad in not even the actual military does like half the damn war.
[1:28:52] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Reizie_Etherealm)
[1:28:53] <IminyourBase> you turn back vertically when you want to come from above
[1:28:53] <leinadtonu> 3d space is awesome
[1:28:54] <%TheGreatBamBe> is this that real bullshit mission?
[1:28:55] <+justianxix> Careful now
[1:28:55] <Freyja_Wion> but turn vertically is the right way
[1:28:58] <%AirlineFood74> ded
[1:29:01] <%DrFacilier> This reminds me of that one time in resident evil....
[1:29:03] <+stolando_florida> 5 minutes to not fuck up, CAN PAT DO IT?
[1:29:04] <%McSnazzyPants> i just want to see him do mission 12 but it'll take a year at this point NotLikeThis
[1:29:05] <+Ell1ot> Pat would eat with a pitchfork instead of a regular fork because the stats are better
[1:29:06] <%AirlineFood74> nvm
[1:29:07] <callsigneagle01> @TheGreatBamBe no, he beat that one before
[1:29:08] <%topendbuzz> he has yet to hit the score
[1:29:09] <%Bane_Kaikyo> jesus christ, PAt is eating so much damag
[1:29:10] <strider3571> use flares when you're slow and a missle is behind you
[1:29:11] <saint_george> go to the return line for repairs at least
[1:29:13] <rytisone> slow and steady wins the race
[1:29:14] <%brave_sj> Hey, it's Paige's dad!

[1:29:16] <callsigneagle01> RIP Paige's dad
[1:29:16] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat Neven is a better weapon than Cerberus because you get it later

[1:29:58] <+ninebreaker6> @AngriestPat the real question is why you dont use flares

[1:34:02] <callsigneagle01> @ManaSphere depends what you mean. Each plane is different and unique
[1:34:07] <%ooblagis> Watch Pat crash at the last second
[1:34:08] <callsigneagle01> and the other half is pilot skill
[1:34:09] <Strikingviking> ruwd
[1:34:09] <Gruhunchously> boom
[1:34:09] <exalt4747> Well like, some planes are better at fighting planes, and some are better at surface targets. And some in the middle.
[1:34:16] <%QueequegTheater> ...?
[1:34:16] <exalt4747> And then there's different special weapons
[1:34:18] <layssaltflavor> that is ur fault pat

[1:37:19] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Enjoy your Ace Combat 4 reference.
[1:37:20] <privatesargent> Stonehenge is such a nostalgia bomb
[1:37:22] <Gruhunchously> @cerberuscarmine Considering he died 5 times trying to take it down, I think it's a mercy.
[1:37:23] <count_bob> Giant laser.

[1:37:42] <+Thorlias> SO PAT whatd ya learn?
[1:37:43] <%Divryne> ACE COMBAT 4 BOYS.
[1:37:49] <ShichiNoBushi> I thought it was referring to real world Stonehenge which shouldn't exist in this setting.
[1:37:50] <go4thekneez> why isnt Sojiro at Leblanc
[1:37:52] <BayowolfTerra> Stonehenge is still around?
[1:37:53] <%AirlineFood74> OUR SCIENCE
[1:37:54] <%graffitisamurai> Time for this game to hit MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE
[1:37:55] <Valdorick> @Caivyre @ing you to say you're 100% right.
[1:37:57] <$cureneckbeard> Literal Stonehenge
[1:37:57] <callsigneagle01> After Mobius One fucked their mouth
[1:37:57] <+lucaflow> Oh man this mission
[1:38:02] <Worldbrand> stonehenge is so fucking dumb and fantastic
[1:38:04] <%R0bobot> ISAF
[1:38:04] <%luckysteak> such a cool mission. asteroid guns rock
[1:38:05] <+Th3SmartAlec> @go4thekneez He got redacted
[1:38:06] <callsigneagle01> YES
[1:38:06] <%QueequegTheater> YEAH WE DID
[1:38:06] <count_bob> Not enough!
[1:38:07] <+thebonebard> so imma assume stonehenge isnt the rocks
[1:38:08] <+drflashylights> LUL yea you did
[1:38:08] <%Divryne> YOU DID.
[1:38:09] <Chaoko99> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:38:09] <mackumbopus> I won't be surprised if all of the Stonehenge Cannons activate simultaneously and attempt to shoot down Pat.
[1:38:10] <+justianxix> Now defend it
[1:38:10] <%ThatGuyfromMars> once
[1:38:10] <callsigneagle01> You DID
[1:38:11] <%AirlineFood74> One lil gun left
[1:38:15] <Halospaz117> @AngriestPat This is mission 12, the same mission number that you destroyed stonehenge in 4
[1:38:16] <count_bob> You didn't blow it up *enough*.
[1:38:17] <Caivyre> Except the one that was already blown up before AC4
[1:38:19] <The_Blumper> you blew ONE up
[1:38:20] <GameOver_Here> You will need a FAST JET for this one. You'll be flying back and forth a lot.
[1:38:21] <%Divryne> NOW DEFEND IT.
[1:38:24] <callsigneagle01> I'm really happy he remembers. I was afraid he'd be 'what the fuck is this thing?'
[1:38:32] <%brave_sj> Yeah good job Pat, now it's gonna be a pain in the ass to use it
[1:38:33] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat AC7 mission 12 is Stongehenge Defensive, AC4's mission 12 was Stongehenge Offensive
[1:38:34] <$cureneckbeard> Today's allies become tomorrow's enemies
[1:38:37] <dekkitout> "I blew you up?!" 'I got better-'
[1:38:38] <SoaringLettuce> the fucking villain comes back a hero
[1:38:40] <ManaSphere> so your playing the opposite side now?
[1:38:41] <%Ozymandias555> So in Ace Combat 4, there was one turret the we did not target since it was not operational. You can even go back in 4 and see the turret. @AngriestPat
[1:38:42] <Worldbrand> i ran out of fuckin missiles on this one lol
[1:38:42] <Caivyre> The end of this mission is so fucking good
[1:38:43] <%Yokuho> Stonehendge is the most secret dark project
[1:38:48] <%Yokuho> You knew?
[1:38:50] <+Th3SmartAlec> Men Hairs?
[1:38:51] <tag545> yesterdays enemy is todays GUN
[1:38:54] <%R0bobot> One gun was out of commission in AC4, you're using that gun.
[1:38:56] <Halospaz117> Oh my god, stonehenge is the Razgriz of the superweapons
[1:39:00] <gbrincks> Avengers OST, going strong
[1:39:01] <privatesargent> @AngriestPat you will want to focus on the ground enemies, if they do too much damage to your forces you lose so you also want a fast plane
[1:39:04] <GameOver_Here> pick a FAST JET
[1:39:05] <Halospaz117> It was a demon, now it's a hero
[1:39:05] <$cureneckbeard> A weapon to surpass Stonehenge
[1:39:05] <+applefibs> is stonehenge a metal gear?
[1:39:08] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Now pay attention to the radio for this mission or you fail big time.
[1:39:09] <Nighthawkmun> KAWWW
[1:39:09] <shevan123> it really feels like a retelling of a myth in modern times
[1:39:10] <%Yokuho> A weapon to surpass stonehenge
[1:39:13] <TerraWraith> Hearing papa Nier talking about monsters again is weird
[1:39:13] <c_drolet> it just shoots massive rocks into the sky
[1:39:15] <Fujiwara_92> SPEED TIME
[1:39:15] <callsigneagle01> @applefibs it's a giant railgun network
[1:39:16] <Tucker0603> @r0bobot this game is the fucking best
[1:39:16] <+DK_Rance> yea pat dont miss
[1:39:17] <+Th3SmartAlec> @applefibs _____ is a Metal Gear
[1:39:20] <+applefibs> wat the fuck
[1:39:21] <gbrincks> Go with a fast lil fucker
[1:39:23] <thebakaliyen> YEET
[1:39:23] <thepowerofpinsol> Plastic Cog
[1:39:24] <%QueequegTheater> You'll need BIG FAST and BIG ANTIAIR
[1:39:25] <%Feralspirit41> now what plane will pat chose
[1:39:25] <Halospaz117> NOT THE PLANES! Shoot the ground!
[1:39:27] <saint_george> bring some anti ground weapons
[1:39:27] <+justianxix> Everything is a metal gear
[1:39:27] <Gruhunchously> A weapon to surpass Metal Gear
[1:39:28] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:39:30] <bleugh> why is stonehenge a super weapon
[1:39:30] <Valdorick> Stonehenge is 100% a Metal Gear - an Ace Combat super weapon.
[1:39:31] <+TheUberknife> get a B2
[1:39:31] <%laserbeaming> Dark Project? Is it the Avatar Project? Where are the sexy sneks?
[1:39:31] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat Gripen is great for this one as well
[1:39:32] <thebakaliyen> Stonehenge is the best
[1:39:34] <+applefibs> i thought this game was about airplanes and melodrama
[1:39:35] <SoaringLettuce> @applefibs its a rail gun built to destory asteroids, later used as anti air
[1:39:35] <+drflashylights> Almost there
[1:39:36] <callsigneagle01> You gotta fight both ground and air this mission, and then the drone swarm
[1:39:36] <Ion_LaserX> almost there
[1:39:37] <ManaSphere> wow thats an extensive tech tree
[1:39:38] <gbrincks> Use your Su buddy
[1:39:39] <layssaltflavor> omg pat mobility wont be good for u
[1:39:41] <The_500lb_Child> 1 more mission and that baby will be yours.
[1:39:41] <KaptainKappathe5th> how the fuck can a plane have so much armor it can only be destroyed by a gun capable of destroying a fucking meteor
[1:39:41] <%Divryne> One more mission.
[1:39:43] <sileo_patronus> One more mission
[1:39:44] <SirDogBear> time to use a nuke to blow up a queen ant
[1:39:44] <callsigneagle01> pick something good for it
[1:39:45] <%connos_livereview> soon
[1:39:46] <%wolf34736> @AngriestPat A10 is best for this mission because there are a lot of ground targets
[1:39:46] <%QueequegTheater> @bleugh It was created to blow up an apocalyptic asteroid
[1:39:47] <Grennold> Gotta grind MP for the big bucks
[1:39:50] <Worldbrand> wiping out the ground targets is a big deal here
[1:39:51] <$cureneckbeard> Use the A-10
[1:39:51] <%Mev852_> I miss anything good?
[1:39:54] <thebakaliyen> Stone henge is that girl you dumped years ago but she's still willing to fuck you after a bad breakup
[1:39:55] <%brave_sj> Consider replaying something easy to get the new plane
[1:39:57] <gbrincks> The Su-37 is pretty cool for this one
[1:39:57] <tag545> many airplanes and vehicles to shoot.
[1:40:00] <%Divryne> Use the SU-37 with the Yellow 13 skin. LUL
[1:40:01] <%R0bobot> I advise a jet with good Ground Missiles
[1:40:01] <privatesargent> A-10 is too slow for this missions
[1:40:02] <exalt4747> So the main thing that @queequegTheater taught me is do not engage the fighters at all. Bombers and ground stuff. Nothing else.
[1:40:02] <+Th3SmartAlec> A Metal Gear to surpass Metal Gear
[1:40:03] <callsigneagle01> 37 can work here actually
[1:40:04] <layssaltflavor> pat listen with the su 33 u can have a railgun
[1:40:04] <callsigneagle01> NO
[1:40:05] <%QueequegTheater> @wolf34736 that is 1000% wrong, he needs speed and antiair to kill bombers
[1:40:05] <%Ozymandias555> @AngriestPat I'd bring 37 with the TLS
[1:40:05] <Grennold> I used the Su-34 for this mission but you're poor so LuL
[1:40:06] <strider3571> dont use the a10
[1:40:06] <%AirlineFood74> NOOOO
[1:40:07] <%Divryne> NO.
[1:40:07] <callsigneagle01> Don't use the A-10
[1:40:09] <%AirlineFood74> IT'S TOO SLOW
[1:40:10] <SpaceGuntank> he needs a fast plane this time
[1:40:11] <reonome> i hope you fail this mission pat
[1:40:11] <%Divryne> DON'T USE THE A10.
[1:40:11] <+drflashylights> LUL
[1:40:11] <Caivyre> NOO
[1:40:11] <callsigneagle01> People are meming
[1:40:12] <Halospaz117> @KaptainKappathe5th It's less the armor that's the problem and more the big ass energy sheild
[1:40:13] <Valdorick> NO! Chat is a fuck! @AngriestPat
[1:40:14] <SoaringLettuce> NOOOOOO
[1:40:15] <+d00msdaydan> oh god he picked HPAA
[1:40:15] <SirDogBear> use the a-10 you coward!

[1:40:22] <+Th3SmartAlec> rip

[1:40:23] <TerraWraith> @Mev852_ We spent about an hour and 10 minutes in mission 11

[1:40:26] <+Reizie_Etherealm> HPAA is fine
[1:40:26] <%Starlight_Gamer> this will be fine
[1:40:26] <callsigneagle01> 37 will work but you gotta work FAST
[1:40:28] <privatesargent> i would have suggested the Fullback if you weren't saving up the money
[1:40:29] <%AirlineFood74> 111
[1:40:31] <Grennold> RIP Osean ground units LuL
[1:40:31] <SpaceGuntank> GOOD LUCK PAT
[1:40:33] <Happy_Karl> Oh no! He's 80 grand short. Looks like Pat will have to use a LESSER plane.
[1:40:37] <%R0bobot> Pat, that jet is a deathtrap for you
[1:40:37] <callsigneagle01> Let's see how fast you can go brother
[1:40:37] <%connos_livereview> why are there so many A 10 fanbois i dont understand
[1:40:37] <SoaringLettuce> the su is fine here
[1:40:41] <Angry_Ev1L> su37 is literally a fake plane LUL
[1:40:41] <%AirlineFood74> RIP OGDF
[1:40:41] <gbrincks> Man, that plane shot is pure fanservice
[1:40:42] <TerraWraith> @AngriestPat You actually have 2 faster planes
[1:40:43] <Caivyre> YE YE YE YE YE
[1:40:43] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat You're actually right that fast = good here
[1:40:44] <+Reizie_Etherealm> He can MSL the ground targets and HPAA the bombers
[1:40:49] <+Th3SmartAlec> BIG GUN
[1:40:50] <%Divryne> GIANT RAILGUN YEET.
[1:40:50] <%LogothX> The Dr. Girl from prison break is in this mission
[1:40:51] <Halospaz117> Ok, I'm fine with him using the SU-37, cuz this is the Yellow squadron plane being used to defend stonehenge
[1:40:55] <SoaringLettuce> @connos_livereview the BRRRT is a huge meme
[1:40:56] <sileo_patronus> DAS A BIG GUN

[1:41:00] <exalt4747> @QueequegTheater oh did I forget to say? When I started again it only took two tries. the second part wasn't hard, though I did die ONCE because I was out of missiles
[1:41:01] <Gruhunchously> Thicc

[1:41:08] <%connos_livereview> oh becos of meme
[1:41:09] <%30Karb> Because it's literally designed as a rotary cannon that flies more than a plane
[1:41:11] <%Divryne> REMIX.
[1:41:11] <count_bob> BRRRRT
[1:41:11] <Psyramics> because they built the plane around the gun
[1:41:11] <%TheSpiritof2277> because it's a BRRRRRT wife
[1:41:11] <RadamirRed> a remix?!
[1:41:11] <gbrincks> There's an A-10 clan and they're the weirdos
[1:41:11] <thebakaliyen> I'm excited for Stonehenge
[1:41:12] <%AncelDeLambert> The A10 is an ugly, beautiful agent of death
[1:41:12] <$nademonkey1100> BRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTT
[1:41:14] <Nitesco> Its an iconic plane
[1:41:14] <The_500lb_Child> Because A-10 is T H I C C

[1:41:15] <2butt4face> brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt
[1:41:15] <thebakaliyen> Stone Cold Steve Henge
[1:41:16] <TerraWraith> An intern drew wings on a gun, and it became the A-10
[1:41:16] <GameOver_Here> Ive seen a lot of A-10 memes on the Ace Combat reddit
[1:41:17] <%supersugoisenpai1> It's a plane built around a gun
[1:41:18] <callsigneagle01> time to defend stonehenge
[1:41:19] <cerberuscarmine> 20 whole minutes
[1:41:19] <+Thorlias> oh god
[1:41:20] <LokimenD> it BIG
[1:41:22] <+jpf1256> BECAUSE ITS COOL AS SHIT
[1:41:24] <%30Karb> Also is practically designed as a plane with enough redundant parts to make two planes
[1:41:25] <%connos_livereview> thanks MEMES
[1:41:26] <%Das_Bass> pat never went on /k/
[1:41:26] <%AirlineFood74> MCONIE Kreygasm
[1:41:27] <+Reizie_Etherealm> People don't care about lasers or missiles, they want the BIG GUN
[1:41:27] <CurrySauseBandit> Cause the A-10 is toughest but ugliest fucking plane on the planet. It's beautiful.
[1:41:28] <%Ozymandias555> @AngriestPat A-10 has high Air to Ground and is a TANK
[1:41:28] <Angry_Ev1L> full band died for this
[1:41:28] <+applefibs> A-10 is well-liked by field troops and they take it back to meme about the BRRRRRT
[1:41:29] <SoaringLettuce> its s REALLY old plane thats still used and people memed it in Ac
[1:41:30] <Yrefe> this is some mgs shit
[1:41:30] <Caivyre> oh this song is so fucking good
[1:41:33] <%cyberdeathkitty> it was DESIGNED Around the GUn
[1:41:33] <gbrincks> For real though, DON'T WAST AMMO
[1:41:33] <%QueequegTheater> @exalt4747 But for real, good job. This one is a real toughie
[1:41:35] <%Owkono> I like the plane that has its own toilet
[1:41:35] <%luckysteak> this is why people wanted the A10
[1:41:35] <Gruhunchously> Burn
[1:41:37] <TheSpartanThief> Like the real thing
[1:41:38] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat she's a fat bottom girl with BBBBRRRRRRRRRTTTT!
[1:41:40] <exalt4747> Thanks!
[1:41:41] <%brave_sj> Because she's a good girl and still relevant to modern warfare despite what the USAF says. F-35 a shit.
[1:41:41] <callsigneagle01> @Yrefe AC has a lotta MGS vibes
[1:41:43] <Halospaz117> Tanks take 2 missles
[1:41:44] <Patzzki217> tanks take 2 missiles
[1:41:44] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Tanks requires 2 MSLs
[1:41:44] <tag545> tank tough
[1:41:45] <%QueequegTheater> I'm proud of you @exalt4747
[1:41:47] <%Starlight_Gamer> this mission is sort of biased to air to air
[1:41:47] <exalt4747> I did it on easy though
[1:41:48] <The_Blumper> @AngriestPat Are you obsessed with Ace Combat cause you're to short to be a pilot in real life like me?
[1:41:49] <privatesargent> its a plane built around its big gun and the fact it can take a huge amount of punishment for a plane
[1:41:50] <+thebonebard> so are they still in not europe or is this the not middle east, i dont think europe has deserts
[1:41:51] <%cyberdeathkitty> brrrrrrtttt
[1:41:54] <%QueequegTheater> IGNORE THE FIGHTERS PAT
[1:41:56] <%R0bobot> Tanks take more than 1 missile
[1:41:57] <SoaringLettuce> use as much gun as possible
[1:41:58] <%AirlineFood74> Tanks take two missiles from fighters
[1:41:58] <GameOver_Here> Make sure you take out the bombers when they show up.
[1:42:03] <%AirlineFood74> most fighters*
[1:42:03] <+applefibs> VTOL is the future though
[1:42:04] <%SpcOpsBear> >Close Air Support
[1:42:09] <callsigneagle01> >vtol
[1:42:09] <Gruhunchously> @thebonebard This not-Europe has deserts in it.
[1:42:12] <callsigneagle01> oh you silly boy
[1:42:13] <%R0bobot> You should have picked a jet with good GROUND missiles
[1:42:18] <%SpcOpsBear> Uh-oh! Should have brought ASMs!
[1:42:21] <%Divryne> Ground units Pat.
[1:42:21] <tag545> help the trucks
[1:42:23] <SirDogBear> using the a-10 to dogfight in this game is like beating a gundam with a zaku or ball
[1:42:24] <%Bane_Kaikyo> "dont wasteee any ammo" *proceeeds to waste all the ammo
[1:42:24] <+justianxix> This place got hit by a bunch of meteors
[1:42:29] <redsynod> Can you Cobra maneuver in this game?
[1:42:29] <%Rafferty3231> the A-10 was and is the best close air support platform in existence. Also BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT
[1:42:31] <dragoon001914> @AngriestPat It's the eighth cannon that was inoperable during AC4 because it was hit by a Ulysses fragment when the asteroid was striking the planet.
[1:42:32] <callsigneagle01> Pat the ground units
[1:42:33] <callsigneagle01> pls
[1:42:34] <Happy_Karl> @AngriestPat The A-10 is literally the strongest jet out there. They've tried so many times to design something to replace it, and they just keep coming back to the glorious A-10.
[1:42:35] <+Mleahy24> can this game be played first person?
[1:42:36] <c_drolet> the f18 would have been a good choice
[1:42:36] <Gruhunchously> What's the matter. I though this was supposed to be THE BEST PLANE
[1:42:37] <sileo_patronus> The A-10 would turn faster Kappa
[1:42:38] <WanderingFlame7> Everything is FINE
[1:42:38] <+robert_edwards> let him figure it out chat, you can't argue with the goblins.
[1:42:39] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Bane_Kaikyo What is this, the RE2 Woolie stream?
[1:42:40] <GameOver_Here> lmao god pat is bad at flying
[1:42:43] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat You gotta defend the ground babies
[1:42:47] <mackumbopus> Everybody knows that getting more bullet holes on your plane makes it more aerodynamic.
[1:42:51] <Halospaz117> @redsynod yes, you can pull of the cobra and other post stall manuvers with certain planes
[1:42:53] <%Ozymandias555> @Mleahy24 yes
[1:42:56] <+Reizie_Etherealm> It's the best plane he's got so there's that
[1:42:56] <privatesargent> @AngriestPat you want to focus on the ground forces, helicopters, and bombers, since the health of your ground forces determines the success of the mission
[1:43:00] <redsynod> Sweet
[1:43:01] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @Th3SmartAlec LUL
[1:43:07] <+thebonebard> does anyone else think this background looks a lot like the art style of battlefield 3
[1:43:07] <callsigneagle01> nice
[1:43:08] <The_500lb_Child> @Mleahy24 Yes, this game can go first person, and cockpit view
[1:43:10] <+applefibs> the A-10 is outdated, the F-35 is the future
[1:43:13] <%Divryne> BOMBERS.
[1:43:16] <%connos_livereview> i actually did most of the game with the super hornet
[1:43:17] <%LogothX> Count you wont do shit
[1:43:19] <callsigneagle01> Bears and Blackjacks! Watch em!
[1:43:19] <tag545> too slow now kill bombers from the down
[1:43:20] <PortableToasterOven> so radio chatter is a thing here
[1:43:21] <%Divryne> 150.
[1:43:21] <%AirlineFood74> @Reizie_Etherealm Gripen is a better ground attacker
[1:43:23] <GameOver_Here> KILL THE BOMBERS
[1:43:23] <thebakaliyen> Look at those downed guns
[1:43:24] <SoaringLettuce> you cant outrun missile pat
[1:43:26] <%Divryne> South.
[1:43:30] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat South.
[1:43:30] <TheSpartanThief> You HAVE to watch for those missiles Pat, they are faster than you
[1:43:31] <+justianxix> MAP
[1:43:32] <thebakaliyen> you think they dream of ribbon insignias?
[1:43:32] <+ArcLifth> heading 190
[1:43:32] <callsigneagle01> BTW tanks take 2 missiles
[1:43:35] <Halospaz117> How bout the big ass plane formation on the map Pat
[1:43:35] <+Gohyakuen> MAP
[1:43:36] <+cvp5127> wait y are we attacking stone henge?
[1:43:36] <layssaltflavor> u can outrun missiles tho
[1:43:38] <sackerkappa> Be their ginger Axe Bomber, Pat.
[1:43:39] <Tucker0603> MAP
[1:43:40] <privatesargent> @AngriestPat tanks are tough, they take 2 missiles to kill
[1:43:40] <tag545> the big group of triangles
[1:43:40] <%Yokuho> B 17 bomber
[1:43:41] <Triplicat> that was a perfect strafe
[1:43:42] <%QueequegTheater> KILL THE BOMBERS PAT
[1:43:42] <%R0bobot> Look at the map lol
[1:43:44] <TheSpartanThief> Ooof
[1:43:44] <lloyddboy> CHECK BIG MAP
[1:43:47] <%AirlineFood74> @cvp5127 erusea are attacking, osea are using it
[1:43:48] <Triplicat> I'm honestly impressed
[1:43:50] <Gruhunchously> BOMBERS
[1:43:50] <GameOver_Here> expand and check your radar
[1:43:52] <thebakaliyen> @cvp5127 it's defending stonehenge
[1:43:55] <callsigneagle01> oh god here it comes
[1:43:56] <+thebonebard> man the lighting and shadows add some really nice subtle colors to this background
[1:43:57] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Gripen doesn't have the SP weapon to offset the lack in speed
[1:44:00] <Triplicat> 3 targets two missiles and a gun kill
[1:44:03] <+applefibs> RAM THEM
[1:44:04] <TerraWraith> @applefibs While normally I'd agree, A-10 still has a better $ to kill ratio. A-10 gets the job done just as well for cheaper
[1:44:12] <+justianxix> Didn't notice the agent the first time
[1:44:16] <SoaringLettuce> @reizie_etherealm the range offsets the speed
[1:44:23] <+applefibs> doesn't matter how much money you save losing a war @TerraWraith
[1:44:24] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Limited ammo
[1:44:26] <%Rafferty3231> The Hawg can lose an engine, half its tail, half of a wing, both hydraulic systems, get shot full of holes, and still fly home.
[1:44:27] <%QueequegTheater> Too close
[1:44:34] <callsigneagle01> @applefibs If this wasn't twitch chat I'd be fighting you for days about this
[1:44:39] <%Divryne> This is a FUCKING battle.
[1:44:41] <SoaringLettuce> use'em well then
[1:44:42] <+Reizie_Etherealm> You can long range LACM 20 times and you're out
[1:44:49] <buffmurffy> this airplane argument in chat is nuts
[1:44:52] <exalt4747> What does HPAA do?
[1:44:56] <%connos_livereview> armed penis carrier
[1:44:58] <Gruhunchously> Trigger is a lost as the rest of you.
[1:45:00] <+justianxix> Now this is a war
[1:45:02] <TerraWraith> @applefibs It absolutely doesn, but whatever. A-10 is still used because it's still useful
[1:45:03] <callsigneagle01> @buffmurffy they usually are
[1:45:06] <%SpcOpsBear> High-Power Anti-Aircraft.
[1:45:07] <%Divryne> @exalt4747 High Powered Anti Air.
[1:45:08] <exalt4747> Now THIS is podracing@
[1:45:10] <%Ozymandias555> @exalt4747 High Powered, they one shot
[1:45:14] <%QueequegTheater> @exalt4747 High Powered Air to Air
[1:45:29] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Pat can MSL all those ground targets in 2-3 passes and be at the next area in a flash to do the same
[1:45:29] <callsigneagle01> o look
[1:45:29] <exalt4747> Well, it sounds good for the bombers rip
[1:45:30] <Gruhunchously> Try spinning, that's a good trick!
[1:45:30] <Worldbrand> oh.... i just realized you have machine guns... i've finished this game...
[1:45:38] <sileo_patronus> We know
[1:45:38] <c_drolet> your strafing runs need to be at shallower angles @AngriestPat
[1:45:41] <%QueequegTheater> Pat literally doesn't know how to play this game unless it's dogfighting
[1:45:41] <TheSpartanThief> A-10C's....Pat's enemy
[1:45:50] <%Yokuho> When does the giant spaceship gonna show up and blow up the white house?
[1:45:55] <Videogamer4> NotLikeThis
[1:45:56] <callsigneagle01> I actually like both the Hog and Lightning II tbh

[1:46:07] <exalt4747> The machine gun is weird because a spraygun being fired from one high speed air unit to another is Not Accurate
[1:46:11] <+Th3SmartAlec> When's the Angelus secret boss?
[1:46:13] <+dodge_and_dust> may as well crash now
[1:46:13] <%kiiiirsten> Oops
[1:46:13] <lionmanguy> Could anything be done about that or is it scripted?
[1:46:13] <Gruhunchously> @Yokuho After Will Smith shows up
[1:46:13] <%Laecerelius> Hey it's not your fault they couldn't hold their own
[1:46:15] <%QueequegTheater> 7-bois were the best

[1:46:41] <+justianxix> the ground forces too
[1:46:42] <exalt4747> I can't wait to go through the old streams and see how Pat did mission 7.

[1:46:42] <%QueequegTheater> Pat climb up
[1:46:45] <callsigneagle01> just needs to focus

[1:46:50] <%Niney_Who> Alt 8000 PAT
[1:46:50] <%BlueMoonBlues> NUMBER DONT GO UP
[1:46:51] <%SpcOpsBear> Are there any space combat games that are like Ace Combat in structure?
[1:46:52] <+applefibs> A-10 is great for destroying sand huts, but it's a deathtrap against advanced air defenses
[1:46:54] <%Divryne> RIP the ground units.
[1:46:57] <+m_gladstone> @lionmanguy You can save them if you're fast enough.
[1:46:59] <%QueequegTheater> They literally just said that Pat
[1:47:00] <privatesargent> those ground forces are going to go RIGHT into Stonehenge and fail the mission
[1:47:02] <callsigneagle01> @applefibs >implying
[1:47:04] <Frostydough> wait a second THIS ISNT STARCRAFT 3
[1:47:07] <callsigneagle01> implications

[1:49:01] <Happy_Karl> Does Pat remember he has High-G turns?
[1:49:04] <exalt4747> Bombers>Ground units near the base> ground units away from the base for priority
[1:49:08] <layssaltflavor> he did it he used flares hes learning
[1:49:08] <IminyourBase> pristine pat!
[1:49:11] <GameOver_Here> I cant believe he remembered flares
[1:49:12] <SpaceGuntank> pat you're going to give everyone here an anxiety attack lol
[1:49:18] <+applefibs> anyway, good thing those deathtraps are being mothballed
[1:49:19] <Gruhunchously> @Happy_Karl I'm not sure he remembers his own name at this point.

[1:49:33] <callsigneagle01> nice try tho

[1:49:35] <Valdorick> SAMs attacking ground targets!? What kinda Vydja Game is this!?
[1:49:35] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Yeah! That one sam will damage the Stonehenge!
[1:49:36] <gbrincks> Yo Pat, hold Circle to see the missiles go
[1:49:38] <LandOfTheWay> surprised pat went with missiles instead of bombs for this mission; seemed more useful for taking out all the ground targets
[1:49:40] <%Laecerelius> Woof
[1:49:41] <$bootysteve> Missile. Missle. Missile.
[1:49:41] <$cureneckbeard> Samuel Site

[1:49:45] <%SpcOpsBear> Oh my GOD, Pat! If you're going to roll off the top, don't dip your nose below the horizon line! You can turn faster if you stop the loop on the horizon line!
[1:49:47] <Happy_Karl> @TerraWraith Amazing.

[1:49:51] <TheSpartanThief> Took them head on, fool

[1:50:20] <privatesargent> @applefibs they are not death traps, they work perfectly well for what they were designed for, close air support that can be launched from the worst airfields against forces with small arms anti-air
[1:50:25] <%connos_livereview> WERE IN for some chop chat
[1:50:25] <Tucker0603> RIP STONEHENDGE

[1:50:35] <%TheSpiritof2277> you can barely take MG fire in this state lmao
[1:50:39] <TerraWraith> @Happy_Karl When he streamed this the first time, the tutorial popped up for it, the guys in the game explained it, and he said, "Wow, that seems useful" then never used them
[1:50:39] <GameOver_Here> Oh he's fucked
[1:50:44] <%AirlineFood74> Pat use your regular missiles
[1:50:47] <%AirlineFood74> please

[1:51:53] <%ooblagis> @AngriestPat Ground Targets only need one missle
[1:51:53] <Toxic_Phazon> Don't try, do!

[1:51:56] <%Remery_> Peer Pressure :)
[1:51:56] <privatesargent> i agree with the previous person, you fly too far away before turning
[1:51:56] <gbrincks> Ooooh, that missile rain
[1:51:57] <Valdorick> Wow, that was kinda awesome, your squad did something.
[1:51:58] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Look at those friendly missiles that didn't do anything lol
[1:51:58] <%Laecerelius> Are his allies actually doing anything at all?
[1:51:59] <IminyourBase> you should probably get a plane that's BETTER pat
[1:52:05] <Gruhunchously> If only we had some air-to-ground missiles.
[1:52:06] <%QueequegTheater> jesus pat
[1:52:10] <callsigneagle01> @Laecerelius very little actually, one of the downsides of the game
[1:52:11] <%TheSpiritof2277> I believd in you... on the next run!
[1:52:11] <Tucker0603> if Pat somehow doesn't fail this I'mma be pissed
[1:52:12] <%SilvaChariot0133> monkaS
[1:52:12] <The_500lb_Child> I'm sorry Pat, but you play like a game journalist. BibleThump
[1:52:14] <cerberuscarmine> all the ground forces are dead D:
[1:52:15] <Happy_Karl> @TerraWraith That doesn't surprise me. I didn't watch his first stream of this since I was getting it the next day. Now this just hurts to watch after putting over 20 hours into it.
[1:52:15] <starotter70> Yo but protect Stonehenge tho
[1:52:19] <gbrincks> Great, now do that again
[1:52:20] <PortableToasterOven> PogChamp maybe
[1:52:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> Sorry dun hurt me moobot D:
[1:52:21] <%30Karb> As much as I hate a10 shilling, it would be legit great at dealing with all the ground stuff.
[1:52:21] <+justianxix> Where is daddy Kratos when we need him
[1:52:21] <+Reizie_Etherealm> PAT YOU CAN DO IT!!
[1:52:23] <%AirlineFood74> @Laecerelius They're super underpowered, only good for stealing kills
[1:52:23] <%graffitisamurai> Yaaay
[1:52:26] <Gruhunchously> Premature celebration.
[1:52:26] <%QueequegTheater> @Gruhunchously Actually the AA missiles are more important for taking down bombers
[1:52:27] <Halospaz117> I think pat might have just barely made it
[1:52:28] <Worldbrand> they're choppers

[1:52:38] <Neo_Kaiser> Has Pat reacted to the announcement of Darkest Dungeon 2?
[1:52:38] <GameOver_Here> Dont risk stalling that close to the ground, youll drop right into it.
[1:52:39] <%Laecerelius> This mission feels like a dynasty warriors map, having to run around everywhere to do everything yourself
[1:52:42] <+Th3SmartAlec> A HIND-D?!
[1:52:45] <exalt4747> The A10 would be good for the ground stuff but it'd be way worse for the bombing runs

[2:36:23] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Reizie_Etherealm)
[2:36:24] <IntrepidEye> you think you would use those antiship missiles on the handful of ship in the mission
[2:36:26] <callsigneagle01> @ComfortableStranger there is one in cockpit view
[2:36:29] <%QueequegTheater> @ComfortableStranger There is he just refuses to use it
[2:36:30] <%EdgyMacaroon> Everyone's favorite game How Many Excuses Can Pat Come Up With
[2:36:38] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat do you remember High-G turns?
[2:36:38] <%QueequegTheater> @ComfortableStranger 1st person view has it
[2:36:47] <%sourceofall> hope your getting used to that missile alert sound because in the later missions it basically never stops
[2:36:47] <BaslerJones> good night Bat !
[2:36:48] <%Starlight_Gamer> 3rd person has no horizon indicator
[2:36:51] <$cureneckbeard> Land the plane on the runway and just drive up and down
[2:36:56] <%TRILLTURBAN> how TF would you sleep through this?
[2:36:58] <callsigneagle01> Cause it'd get in the way of the plane view
[2:36:59] <+justianxix> How shit can you be that pat is beating you
[2:37:00] <Happy_Karl> @ComfortableStranger It also only shows up in cockpit and nose camera. Not 3rd person.
[2:37:03] <sileo_patronus> What the fuck is the base commander gonna do at this point?

[2:38:19] <dekkitout> "Plane-Shaped Vergil" NOW?
[2:38:20] <%ace_cfa44> fun fact: the only biplane credited with a jet kill was only given the credit because its max speed was slower than the jets stall speed, and the jet crashed trying to shoot it down
[2:38:24] <BaslerJones> @AngriestPat have you played tom clancy's Hawx ?
[2:38:25] <Gruhunchously> So much Combat, so little Ace

[2:38:32] <jobbedbone> pull enbSwoleL bibleThump enbSwoleR up
[2:38:33] <%NWR_James> Coming down directly on AD Tanks makes it hard for them to shoot down the missiles. Open up with the gun while in the dive and only one has to hit.
[2:38:35] <%QueequegTheater> Oh no THEY have Su-35's!
[2:38:37] <+Shackle_Rustyford> doesnt being a tank just make them a bigger, slower target?

[2:42:58] <SoaringLettuce> @airlinefood74 that is a FANTASTIC analogy
[2:43:00] <ignisacer> try and keep you attitude above 600, and speed above 400
[2:43:01] <KnightofNights2> LASM LASM
[2:43:03] <+Louie_Salmon> Your plane can't hover in the air
[2:43:05] <%ryh534> donations!
[2:43:06] <triangularblasphemy> Planes are strongest at low altitude. Guns are most powerful at hand to hand
[2:43:08] <%Finalknightmare> pat is flying like its a first person shooter
[2:43:11] <+jotaro_cooljo> @AngriestPat hold triangle to do a tracking camera. Also make sure your speed is above 300. the stall speed is about 250 so being 300+ is a good cushion
[2:43:12] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat L2 + thrust
[2:43:13] <SauceJockey> high g turns slow you down
[2:43:15] <triangularblasphemy> These are the truths of this world
[2:43:18] <layssaltflavor> high g turn and speed up pat
[2:43:19] <callsigneagle01> Does Pat remember how to do High G turns ?
[2:43:21] <%AirlineFood74> they slow you down though
[2:43:23] <%NWR_James> PRIORITY ORDER: Aircraft on the ground, AD Tanks, SAM, AA, EVERYTHING ELSE
[2:43:23] <%wolf34736> high g turns slow you down
[2:43:24] <+justianxix> Just use them at higher speeds and altitudes
[2:43:35] <callsigneagle01> good stuff
[2:43:37] <+applefibs> planes work by pushing their wings through the air to create lift, if they stop going forward then they stop flying
[2:43:39] <Fujiwara_92> PIZZA PULL UP
[2:43:40] <+Louie_Salmon> G-turns cost speed for a faster turn, I don't think you know about those
[2:43:42] <Valdorick> Yes Count, because you're a fountain of good jokes.
[2:43:47] <triangularblasphemy> Lets give that helicopter unit something to sweat about

[2:46:00] <+valkuma> the ADVANCED tanks have anti missle shit and theyre the worst
[2:46:06] <ignisacer> i have a theory that pat doesn't handle 3D movement well, it's why he can't pay attention to anything else when he's flying
[2:46:07] <triangularblasphemy> Those AD Tanks are protoskynet AIs
[2:46:07] <%QueequegTheater> Just use your MG it's not worth losing the missiles

[2:55:55] <$MightyMaxT> Isn't Sky King a DS3 boss?
[2:55:57] <dragoon001914> This mission is on the anniversary of when Mobius 1 was there.

[2:56:01] <%NWR_James> KILL ALL BELKANS
[2:56:01] <tag545> cringe crushing sincerity
[2:56:02] <Halospaz117> Farbanti get's invaded everytime it's sky eye's birthday, even when there isn't a war
[2:56:05] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Can people commit unlimited crimes in Mihaly’s kingdom?
[2:56:06] <+paladinstarbuster> SKY KING WOO
[2:56:08] <callsigneagle01> He literally cares about nothing but being able to fly well again
[2:56:08] <+Louie_Salmon> I legitimately like the Mihaly B(A?) plot, it's really simple and hype.
[2:56:10] <%Divryne> Mister X gonna give it to yah.
[2:56:10] <+Lordgale119> that's the Storm King and Nameless King @MightyMaxT
[2:56:11] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The sky belongs to those who doesn't give a shit about the ground!
[2:56:12] <nzrai> oh mobius 1...
[2:56:13] <+valkuma> i love all the missions in the last half of this game

[2:56:15] <shinbuya> air gear
[2:56:16] <$cureneckbeard> You have surpassed even the sky. I award you the title of Big Sky
[2:56:18] <triangularblasphemy> One day Mihay flew into the sky. 9 months later, two young girls came crashing in from space.
[2:56:19] <KnightofNights2> THE RACE WAR STARTS NOW
[2:56:19] <SoaringLettuce> the air youre breathing is a fucking belkan secret black project
[2:56:20] <+Th3SmartAlec> @MightyMaxT Nameless King. But close enough
[2:56:22] <%QueequegTheater> SkyEye gets his dick hard by bombing Farbanti
[2:56:23] <%TRILLTURBAN> who would win, Viper from Titanfall or Mihay?
[2:56:25] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The GROUNDLESS KING
[2:56:27] <Rexenexus> @flagi64 mythical anime politics and cool planes
[2:56:29] <Gruhunchously> Using the biometric data of an old war veteran to program the AI of machines fighting in a current war is SO Metal Gear it hurts.
[2:56:30] <+Salvation122> If there's a Sky King are there also Sky Pirates? Is... Is this just Skies of Arcadia?
[2:56:32] <%ryh534> Read Donations!
[2:56:33] <%Starlight_Gamer> this mission is okay. a bit boring but okay
[2:56:35] <ShinBojangles> I want another Area 88 anime.
[2:56:36] <ScreamingMeat> Atmosphere Monarch
[2:56:37] <ignisacer> does the SPACE WAR START NOW?
[2:56:38] <%flagi64> is this Air Gear?
[2:56:43] <callsigneagle01> @DougintheTrench no, he doesn't care about being king. He only wants to fly. That's why he doesn't care about Shilage and signed up with Erusia as a normal pilot.
[2:56:44] <%connos_livereview> @cureneckbeard BIG SKY IN THE Aoo
[2:56:45] <SkyIcewind> space combat begins now
[2:56:45] <%QueequegTheater> @Salvation122 Skies of Arcadia wishes
[2:56:47] <%ooblagis> This is such a fun mission
[2:56:49] <callsigneagle01> He only cared for the sky
[2:56:52] <SkyIcewind> The game will now transition into gundam
[2:56:53] <KaptainKappathe5th> man this war was quick
[2:56:54] <callsigneagle01> Not the kingdom or anything else
[2:56:54] <$MightyMaxT> Gotcha. Thanks @Lordgale119 & @Th3SmartAlec
[2:56:55] <%NWR_James> "Excuse me sir, are you Belkan?" "Why yes I am" *bang*
[2:56:57] <Caivyre> "Trigger, hit Mihaly with my Dragonator"
[2:56:58] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> @flagi64 thats something very very different
[2:57:00] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat look at the DATE
[2:57:00] <%R0bobot> Same day as the assault on Farbanti in AC4

[2:57:11] <+justianxix> Its a good mission
[2:57:11] <callsigneagle01> shit goes down here
[2:57:12] <Halospaz117> @R0bobot and also sky eye's b-day
[2:57:13] <%Sovspot> @flagi64 Eruseans started a war because OSEA built an elevator in "their territory".
[2:57:14] <TerraWraith> This is a long one
[2:57:15] <%Das_Bass> any Apex tonight?
[2:57:20] <SoaringLettuce> reminder: the namcoverse exists
[2:57:21] <SkyIcewind> This war's still longer than AC6
[2:57:22] <+d00msdaydan> DEFINITELY a10 for this mission
[2:57:25] <dekkitout> Next Time; Assualt on Tepplin
[2:57:29] <+Salvation122> @QueequegTheater Man don't shit on Skies of Arcadia, that's one of like three games I'm still salty they never ran on SBFP
[2:57:31] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat Look at the date and wish SkyEye a happy birthday right now
[2:57:34] <hntronium> @Das_Bass That's saturdays
[2:57:35] <SkyIcewind> In that game you're on the defensive for a mission and a half and then suddenly you're a super army that cannot be stopped
[2:57:36] <%flagi64> This feels like the Air Gear
[2:57:36] <%Divryne> It's useless.
[2:57:37] <FourLeafLover> fast plane fast missile
[2:57:38] <callsigneagle01> anti-stealth
[2:57:39] <%ooblagis> It's awful
[2:57:39] <triangularblasphemy> Big mission coming. F-35 is good here, but do what you can
[2:57:42] <Supabait> stealth? genome soldiers?
[2:57:45] <SoaringLettuce> ridge racer exists on strangereal
[2:57:46] <SubjectX07x> A-10 or big gay
[2:57:48] <+drflashylights> Almost there PogChamp
[2:57:49] <%QueequegTheater> @Salvation122 This series is literally 40% of my childhood
[2:57:50] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Erusea started the for for much, much dumber reasons than Osea building that damn elevator believe me
[2:57:51] <%Jjrossman> STELF
[2:57:52] <+Tadashi047> close
[2:57:52] <%R0bobot> It makes it harder for enemies to target you
[2:57:52] <+justianxix> perrty
[2:57:54] <Vvvzzzlllvvvzzzlllvvv> Fly the F35 so we can pretend it isn't mismanaged bullshit
[2:57:56] <%NME_Dom> F-14D with Razgriez paint scheme is the best

[2:58:00] <SpaceGuntank> THE FASTEST PLANE
[2:58:01] <+Reizie_Etherealm> started the war*
[2:58:01] <%ooblagis> Best Plane in the game, even the Wyvern doesn't compare
[2:58:02] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> @flagi64 the planes don't have the required tits to be air gear
[2:58:02] <callsigneagle01> There's one of the three planes of Russia's Air Froce
[2:58:03] <ignisacer> @AngriestPat A-10 though
[2:58:03] <%Remery_> melt in your mouth
[2:58:03] <+Th3SmartAlec> Just wanna put ot on the exhaust ports

[2:58:06] <+mobius_won> Eww
[2:58:09] <%Sovspot> You havent even flown it yet
[2:58:10] <MementoExtasis> actual plane in this fake world 🤔
[2:58:12] <+Thorlias> hype
[2:58:13] <+Lordgale119> @AngriestPat you have to conserve missiles or go back for reloads this mission, it's required
[2:58:18] <+Gohyakuen> lies
[2:58:22] <redsynod> She's RIGHT there
[2:58:26] <%flagi64> @LordLicoriceThe3rd we must add them then
[2:58:28] <+BroLASco> best plane is an actual missle
[2:58:31] <FourLeafLover> yep that's exactly what the description says
[2:58:31] <%Sovspot> its borderline useless
[2:58:32] <%ssjklyco> look at this plane jane
[2:58:32] <Gruhunchously> @MementoExtasis Built by a country that doesn't exist.
[2:58:33] <callsigneagle01> No, Steath Coating does that. Anti-Stealth lets you track enemy stealth planes
[2:58:35] <callsigneagle01> damn it
[2:58:37] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> bolt on plane tits
[2:58:37] <callsigneagle01> who lied to him
[2:58:41] <PortableToasterOven> oh yeah: "return line" mission
[2:58:41] <+Tadashi047> that just detects stealth
[2:58:41] <%DougintheTrench> @callsigneagle01 I meant more along the lines of aesthetics. An ancient badass who's lost a lot and now fights in a swirling tide of clouds and gunfire.
[2:58:43] <+Gohyakuen> wrong pat
[2:58:43] <strider3571> this is useless
[2:58:44] <tag545> LIES
[2:58:47] <strider3571> dont use the stealth thingy
[2:58:49] <+Tadashi047> useless here

[2:59:09] <ExplosiveLime> I just die after save to rearm
[2:59:09] <jj_cabo> Gotta Go Fast
[2:59:11] <%QueequegTheater> >That ATG stat
[2:59:12] <triangularblasphemy> You fly about 20 feet from your targets, so their stealth tech is countered with your EYEBALLS
[2:59:13] <FourLeafLover> only useful in like one mission, and only a little
[2:59:14] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> @flagi64 how do we add trashy anime plots?

[3:13:55] <triangularblasphemy> Taking a break
[3:13:59] <%Skeletorexplains> Pizza time
[3:13:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @SkyIcewind no....yeah
[3:14:00] <%Mystery_Syringe_Hobo> @kiiiirsten Break time
[3:14:02] <callsigneagle01> @Torivore cause he is
[3:14:03] <Gray_skies1993> just a break atm @kiiiirsten
[3:14:03] <Vigonept> I coupd go for some pizzq
[3:14:15] <%Reaped_Psyche> Old pilot man is cool. Pat crashes a lot because he doesn't know what an altimeter or stalling are. That's the plot as far as I know.
[3:14:17] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The upcoming mission is like a big story exposition dump
[3:14:19] <%Prism_Wing> @callsigneagle01 I imagine the planes go zoom zoom and a boom boom?
[3:14:21] <%kiiiirsten> Nice, thanks guys, it's only 8PM here and I'm ready for more plane crashin'
[3:14:31] <callsigneagle01> @Prism_Wing ho boy get ready
[3:14:31] <triangularblasphemy> Time to go get captured at an airfield for pizza
[3:14:38] <callsigneagle01> you guys will need the help by next mission
[3:14:40] <Torivore> Now it all makes sense, thank you kind sir
[3:14:45] <callsigneagle01> the story is so weird by then
[3:14:46] <callsigneagle01> but fun
[3:14:47] <+Louie_Salmon> I mean it's fairly straightforward at the moment, erusa is the bads with the drones, osea made a space elevator and now erusea has control of it, and mihaly is sky king
[3:14:49] <callsigneagle01> very fun
[3:14:50] <triangularblasphemy> Goodnight chat, nice flying with yah
[3:14:51] <SkyIcewind> i want to play ff14 but i also want to watch a ginger canadian bomb civilian skyscrapers recklessly damn you pat

[3:15:24] <+Thorlias> so anyone else want a drink?
[3:15:26] <$cureneckbeard> Pat
[3:15:34] <SkyIcewind> Mihaly Shishaka Shalashaka or something
[3:15:35] <+Promessa_EX> Mihaly pronounced Mee- hi
[3:15:35] <%Prism_Wing> @skyicewind do both. Tape your phone to your right eye while you play Kappa
[3:15:39] <$cureneckbeard> Patrick Boivin
[3:15:40] <+Louie_Salmon> Jpeg dog is a big part of the story, can't forget that
[3:15:42] <callsigneagle01> But yes, Mihaly doesn't care about his old kingdom or anything because he just wants to fly. He gets that by agreeing to work with the Erusian Space Administration scientist man to create new shit, and in turn his flying style is programmed into the drones you see
[3:15:44] <SkyIcewind> o fuk u rite
[3:15:45] <lloyddboy> @Louie_Salmon but why bandog do the bad???
[3:15:47] <%Faustgesicht> I know that some planes are at war and that's about it @callsigneagle01
[3:15:48] <callsigneagle01> so it's all connected
[3:15:49] <SoaringLettuce> its fiiiine, everyone in those buildings vaporized when ulysses fell anyway

[3:16:38] <SkyIcewind> Pat stalled IRL due to paige and crashed, he ded.
[3:16:38] <+Louie_Salmon> @lloyddboy Actually not sure on that one, I think he just had some beef with that guy and decided that was the best time to get him
[3:16:38] <dekkitout> Mihaly is literally the protag from Aldnoah Zero "Sure this cool bionic eye is melting my brain, but this cool orange mech tho..."
[3:16:41] <$Retrocop87> yeah

[3:17:38] <%Prism_Wing> @worldbrand wtf lol
[3:17:39] <+dodge_and_dust> it was certainly a "show"
[3:17:40] <dekkitout> I wish I could be doesn't afraid of nothin'
[3:17:41] <%DougintheTrench> That was so scary, it reminded me that I still have to do my taxes.
[3:17:46] <+dirtsniffurperson> how you drinking all that redbull yet?
[3:17:47] <%connos_livereview> there were no crashes had at ALL
[3:17:47] <+Louie_Salmon> @callsigneagle01 God, you're so into this, it's just as earnest as the actual story
[3:17:50] <yorik1> are you just going to talk forever or are you going to play video games?
[3:17:51] <Worldbrand> @Prism_Wing i have no explanation
[3:17:52] <spire6> and speed
[3:17:53] <%Remery_> mtrdOo
[3:17:53] <callsigneagle01> But yeah, seriously, if ANY of you guys get confused about the story in the near future don't be afraid to ask cause it gets reeeeally confusing and it's kinda too short to explain
[3:17:54] <Desertfishing> gravity is a bitch
[3:17:55] <%konekoryugamine> Is she okay?
[3:17:55] <%kiiiirsten> @RantingRavager That's what happened when I was in Liam's stream and I said "Well piss right in my butt" and he read it out loud
[3:17:58] <Dakuu75> lmfao
[3:17:59] <spire6> and lift
[3:18:08] <LokimenD> Pat was having a rough time
[3:18:08] <SkyIcewind> For a guy who supports Zeon he sure truly does have his soul weighed down by gravity.

[3:18:10] <callsigneagle01> @Louie_Salmon Well tbh it's cause I love the sky as much as he does
[3:18:11] <%Divryne> Pat I'm spooked.
[3:18:12] <RantingRavager> @kiiiirsten well, my lesson has been learned
[3:18:17] <callsigneagle01> there's a real romantacism about it
[3:18:18] <%konekoryugamine> AUGH
[3:18:20] <%Sovspot> You pretend your planes are really helicopters.
[3:18:22] <%R0bobot> Paige, you sound miserable. Hope you get better.
[3:18:22] <castcode> D:
[3:18:26] <Dakuu75> I think forgetting about gravity in REAL LIFE and forgetting about it in a GAME are 2 different things
[3:18:31] <+jotaro_cooljo> Paige, take my energy to heal yourself
[3:18:32] <aimlesshealer> I wish I had a plane. I would fly in the plane with my dog
[3:18:35] <Toxic_Phazon> Paige sounds SO disappointed in you Pat

[3:18:58] <callsigneagle01> @Faustgesicht cause Full Band pissed him off

[3:25:41] <dragoon001914> Paige should drink lots of water.
[3:25:42] <alrobot2014> having a perpetual fever sounds like a fucking nightmare

[3:26:31] <%Das_Bass> HE LIKES THE TMP
[3:26:32] <%laserbeaming> 666
[3:26:38] <SkyIcewind> Give a fever to a chicken and then throw the chicken at Paige, according to her logic, that will cure her, right?
[3:26:49] <Dakuu75> <3
[3:26:49] <%konekoryugamine> @AngriestPat If Paige has a fever and sneezing, try making homemade chicken soup. My mom has a recipe for homemade chicken soup that will make you feel SO Much better!

[3:29:05] <Dakuu75> gravity usually prevents this... I have a beard, i've never gotten BEARD hair in my eye
[3:29:06] <$cureneckbeard> The solution is clearly to not shave
[3:29:06] <%nofestu2> I have a beard and I keep my eyes open like a man

[4:02:55] <spire6> The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is.

[4:05:27] <+Name_Meme> You fucked up someone's house
[4:05:40] <%DougintheTrench> I'm seriously surprised there were only 3 countries that use Imperial. Like, I knew the US was the biggest of a few countries to us it. But I thought there'd at least be 10 or so.
[4:05:45] <%ElenaManetta> The #WhosTalking hashtag is not as Paige infested as I was hoping

[4:06:49] <DeanX27> "No, don't hit the penis!" - Pat 2019
[4:06:49] <%DougintheTrench> He's playing Street Fighter 5 and only playing that Plane Stage.
[4:06:50] <Lukas_Ipsum> also, any followers of QI? turns out Snafu is an appropriate military action for Situation Normal: all fucked up

[4:08:15] <%PlainSimpleTailor> They're tryin' to creep up on you
[4:08:16] <callsigneagle01> Our electronic old men are far in advance of theirs. Their flexebility has allowed us to make progress on the mythical city on the hills
[4:08:17] <%Sovspot> <<La la-la la the awacs aircraft Oka Nieba, that would mean skyeye in your language.>>
[4:08:20] <dekkitout> "Oh, are those your boats?" 'No-' "Imma kill em" 'Please don't'
[4:08:21] <%DougintheTrench> How's it feel to be the BIg Boss of Airplanes? @AngriestPat
[4:08:22] <shigerydingo> this game has a amazing soundtrack
[4:08:22] <DrMoose7> boats, planes natural prey
[4:08:26] <%Gray_skies1993> [DAIRY QUEEN] has already touched the doorknob
[4:08:31] <%Prism_Wing> Wait, fuck. Hey Google: How old is Tsundere Plane Undertale?
[4:08:32] <%valachi> Also, I hope they remake AC3 to have all of it's content that the japanese version had.
[4:08:33] <Gruhunchously> @callsigneagle01 We've had to endure much, you and I, but within the week, there will be old men running the world.
[4:08:40] <pimpinahz> @remery_ meh we got mostly the same shit as the US

[4:08:57] <%lewdskeletor13> Planes are just the Boats of the sky
[4:08:59] <%Remery_> @pimpinahz okay :)
[4:09:02] <%joylent_blue> the real boat was the plane in our hearts all along
[4:09:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> when I was a kid in Ghetto Canadia, there used to be a Tas-T-Freeze in a little buthole town three hours from where I lived.
[4:09:05] <%Gray_skies1993> @Valdorick Kappa XD
[4:09:10] <i_love_thicc_chicks> But can you do a barrel roll?
[4:09:14] <+Reizie_Etherealm> We have ship girls, tank girls and gun girls, we need plane girls!
[4:09:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> no, thats SKYSHIPS
[4:09:21] <Raishiro> no that's an airship!

[4:09:26] <%Gray_skies1993> ZEPPELIN
[4:09:28] <+Name_Meme> Large ships have anti-missile guns
[4:09:29] <callsigneagle01> Those were more like airships but then they caught on fire
[4:09:30] <%Mr_Strut> That's blimps
[4:09:30] <Weeabooninja> @Reizie_Etherealm Girly Air Force

[4:09:35] <aimlesshealer> Why don't airships real?
[4:09:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nah, airships are the cruiseliners of the sky.
[4:09:41] <$Retrocop87> we already have anthropomorphized planes
[4:09:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> more like an air cr
[4:09:43] <callsigneagle01> @aimlesshealer cause they suck
[4:09:46] <lizard0tm> I want to be on a pirate ship that flies

[4:09:48] <%dreadxvi> whenz @AngriestPat stares at FFXII remake continued
[4:09:48] <+blastazoid26> @AngriestPat Did you reset the clock?
[4:09:51] <%Mystery_Syringe_Hobo> and astronauts said I want to be on a boat in the higher sky
[4:09:54] <aimlesshealer> @callsigneagle01 This bitch of an earth...
[4:09:56] <%themoonbear45> wouldn't a sky boat be more like a blimp?
[4:09:57] <%lewdskeletor13> The Wright Brothers wanted to make a boat but they were scared of the water so they made a Sky Boat
[4:09:58] <%BestTeaMaker> THREE STRIKES
[4:10:04] <SoaringLettuce> airships used to be real, they were called zeppelins
[4:10:06] <%BestTeaMaker> they gave you a nickname
[4:10:07] <%Gray_skies1993> yeah unfortunately, zeppelins are just not practical
[4:10:07] <+Reizie_Etherealm> New possibility has been opened up to me
[4:10:08] <waifoong98> The only good air ship is the one in Red Aler 2 LUL
[4:10:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat eat boat
[4:10:14] <%ooblagis> SHOOT THE BUILDINGSs
[4:10:15] <%valachi> Man Ace Combat really does a good job at making you feel like a malevolent demi-god
[4:10:18] <%Gorgen> pat ruins a boat race
[4:10:22] <TerryTheTurret> So if planes are sky boats and boats are water cars, then are planes just cars?
[4:10:22] <%ooblagis> THEY FALL
[4:10:23] <%SilvaChariot0133> Riiiiight Kappa
[4:10:25] <%ssjklyco> That's Wrong
[4:10:25] <CrimsonFox777> I wish we had more zeppelins. Too bad they're highly flammable.
[4:10:26] <aimlesshealer> But if it looks cool enough, that'll make it fly better right?
[4:10:29] <callsigneagle01> @valachi you're just a flying hero
[4:10:30] <lizard0tm> I want Treasure Planet style airships
[4:10:33] <%ElenaManetta> Herrrp a derp humans are just land fish
[4:10:36] <KaptainKappathe5th> why is the city flooded
[4:10:39] <pimpinahz> that's right cuz the boat was plane to see
[4:10:39] <dekkitout> I think he has in mind a boat with a giant hot air balloon at the top, rather than sails
[4:10:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> planes, flying cars goin at mach speed.
[4:10:40] <DirtyPopcornJ> We need more funding for airships. But the again, Hindenburg.
[4:10:40] <$daveronald> you cant drown in the sky, so its saffer

[4:10:52] <KaptainKappathe5th> ohhhh
[4:10:53] <%shockzndrawe> @AngriestPat Imagine if the sky was filled with half of the fucked up shit you find at the bottom of the ocean
[4:10:54] <callsigneagle01> you can actually see the crater
[4:10:55] <%ooblagis> It's flooded because asteroids
[4:10:55] <Valdorick> Facts
