[0:12:16] <%Rawklobstah88> Grats to Bungie!
[0:12:16] <%RaikenTB> Cool. Now make a new Oni game.
[0:12:17] <+d00msdaydan> now bungie really is a small indie dev
[0:12:17] <%kamen_advent> Bungie didn't want a repeat of Halo
[0:12:18] <WRFWD> Bungie sold themselves to a Chinese company
[0:12:18] <+BaronEgo> Why would they continue trying to make Destiny a thing
[0:12:18] <valentinostand> Oni remake like god of war ps4

[0:12:19] <CaptainKarite> now blizzard
[0:12:19] <Magpiejake> because destiny is dead
[0:12:20] <%fFailureatlife> Destiny now published by EA
[0:12:20] <%Cannondancer> Shows how little faith they had in destiny
[0:12:20] <%ThePuddingDead> so it's gonna be DLing then?
[0:12:20] <+RamblingRyno> Maybe now they can go back to making good games!
[0:12:21] <%cureneckbeard> no longer friends

[0:12:23] <%chubbypencil> They always owned the IP it was PUBLISHING RIGHTS that they somehow kept

[0:12:26] <DougintheTrench> @AngriestPat Who's horrible sex crime did Bungie discover to make that happen?
[0:12:27] <medievalshadows> good ea was holding them back
[0:12:27] <$Ascethetic> BIG PURRS
[0:12:28] <Angry_Ev1L> you think destiny will stop being trash after that? lmao...
[0:12:29] <energywarning> i'm betting on running out of money
[0:12:29] <%Noponiz> @angriestpat since all their recent games run on the same engine, think it's somewhat safe to say thay if you can run mhw, you can run re2make?
[0:12:30] <%Rawklobstah88> Bigger trashfire incoming
[0:12:31] <BeefyQueefer> Destiny mustn't be doing too well then if they got to keep it, methinks.
[0:12:31] <$SGrim> Meta: Bungie fucked up D2 intentionally to keep the IP when the split happened rooPog
[0:12:32] <+SparkAfterDark> destiny is destiny
[0:12:33] <Aydarkzero> Bungie is free!
[0:12:33] <Stewbedale> Will be really interesting to see how that goes
[0:12:34] <%Gogogolem> You mean the Ip they ran into the ground?
[0:12:36] <alrobot2014> @EdgeSetter right now?
[0:12:36] <ComradeConquistador> Bungie is the master of their own Destiny.
[0:12:36] <majima666> damnit i want to watch pat-kun but i dont want to spoil it for myself. just downloaded it right this second lol
[0:12:36] <%lewdskeletor13> @angriestpat have you played the demo yet?

[0:12:37] <%Niney_Who> apatDab
[0:12:39] <+runegod20> i don't know much about the deal but since it was their first IP after halo and leaving microsoft, i would expect them to do everything they can to always keep it their own thing
[0:12:40] <$nick__sayre> cheer200 Speaking of Destiny, any interest in returning to the game at all?
[0:12:40] <$Order_of_Mystery> fester in shit, eververse
[0:12:41] <retro_redux> You mean now I can actually enjoy a Destiny game after Activision shits all over it?
[0:12:42] <+EdgeSetter> @alrobot2014 yup
[0:12:43] <IronEncore> It can only go 2 ways
[0:12:43] <frydaynitefight> @AngriestPat will this demo be live at midight for others to play?
[0:12:44] <%MahoganyVince> Watch Destiny 3 be co-published by Sony
[0:12:47] <+ShlickShlocks> Bungie were the ones who pushed the insane monetisation in Destiny 2. So I don't hold out much hope for Destiny 3
[0:12:47] <PlasticJake> I guess they bought themselves some more faith from their base 🤷♂️
[0:12:49] <%Niney_Who> That's 5 HOURS LUL

[0:13:43] <PlasticJake> I thought most of the folks who were working on good bungee games during the golden age had already jumped ship 🤷♂️
[0:13:45] <retro_redux> I believe in Bungie now. If other companies can escape the “Shades of Grey” grasp of Activision then that’s awesome.

[0:13:51] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat So people complained about the dlcs being locked behind a huge grind for new higher light levels they couldn't prepare for. So instead they made a puzzle no one has solved for the past week.

[0:18:14] <$spleekle> Do you have to switch your account oAustarlia ?
[0:18:14] <IronEncore> Elmo attack
[0:18:15] <+azure22900> It's really dumb
[0:18:17] <+ArmoredDeath> atpGasm
[0:18:17] <Mr_Loboto> Pat pats the emlo
[0:18:18] <+RamblingRyno> It is a marketing technique to get us talking bout it
[0:18:19] <%Gogogolem> annaGay annaGay
[0:18:23] <%fattness132> @AngriestPat can't wait for the pc version to be cracked for unlimited time
[0:18:24] <tapeworm1969> Your Pussy's Glued To A Building On Fire is my fav Bieber song
[0:18:25] <MrGoonBones> a demo for an already-released game?
[0:18:25] <%FrostMass22> It's viral marketing and a way to pump their numbers with crazies who make multiple accounts
[0:18:26] <GrandmasterBFunk> they want it to be an event
[0:18:27] <%JGardner88> Is this up yet? Or do I still need to make a Australia account?
[0:18:27] <+azure22900> How long did it take to download?
[0:18:29] <$Tuskor13> what a name
[0:18:30] <+thatfilthyweeb> man i love me some race war
[0:18:30] <lordhavok98> have we entered a new age in demos where they all have a gimmick
[0:18:30] <+dramajoe> spend 30min trying to shoot the camera with the shotgun
[0:18:31] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s real dumb
[0:18:32] <+runegod20> the concept sounds cool
[0:18:32] <blueberrythebard> They only have 30 minutes of the game done
[0:18:32] <%joylent_blue> what timed DMC demo
[0:18:32] <%maskedriderhero> It's probably like a free drug sample, to get people craving for the full release
[0:18:33] <SometimesATom> I thought it was a call back to the first RE2 demo in 98?
[0:18:35] <Pixelated_Cloud> how many accounts does he have stocked up chat
[0:18:36] <OkamiDude15> how many accounts did you make pat? sfhTHINK

[0:42:32] <IronEncore> Route A

[0:44:51] <+runegod20> the tutorial would take up a few seconds everytime they come up so turning them off is optimal speedrun strats
[0:44:52] <ScreamingMeat> The time limit is fucking stupid
[0:44:52] <+chexmixisbest> it would be great if it started already
[0:44:52] <powerprotoman> "Tune the brightness to make it so the pattern is barely visable" *pat makes the block pure white*
[0:44:54] <AMajorTom> Does this not entertain you? Then you're playing.
[0:44:54] <%walternatorz> but pat, watching you update settings is the real gameplay

[0:56:53] <%PumpAction> Oh boy
[0:56:54] <alexandrecau> honestly zombie apocalypse is lethal not by zombie bite but by how the air is suffocating with dead meat, it's like drowning in a carcass
[0:56:55] <%NovaKnightmare> SHOOT HIM
[0:56:55] <revzero25> MR. X
[0:56:55] <blaine_themono> r2

[0:56:57] <%Jeikujeiku> did he shit his pants?
[0:56:58] <+Pendragwn> @AngriestPat Now imagine if after getting this hype ass demo, they cancelled the entire game.
[0:56:58] <Mangahero18> Where are they shooty bang bangs? Its almost like Resident Evil is a horror series or something.
[0:56:58] <Palmtuna> That aiming animation with the flashlight is lovely
[0:56:59] <+UltraConfused> Man the lab stuff is gonna look great in this engine

[0:57:15] <Run44forrest> pat look at the poop physics
[0:57:20] <+runegod20> not even a document
[0:57:20] <%NovaKnightmare> this is where Chief Irons told the press he isnt a creepy weirdo
[0:57:21] <agadejobi> How did the outbreak fuck up the police station this much?
[0:57:22] <TheLoneWolf1601> Quick turn pat
[0:57:23] <krymzen5> i could see them changing stuff
[0:57:23] <+BlackMage66652> RIP frames
[0:57:24] <DingusMcBaseball> @jimbobjoe1234 people shit themselves when they die so probably yeah
[0:57:24] <randallboone1> It looks Fantastic
[0:57:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> 3..2...1
[0:57:27] <ToneBacas> there used to be a hole here, but now it's gone
[0:57:28] <+Iggle_Ohs> They'll probably shuffle the puzzles around entirely
[0:57:29] <%OdysseyKnight> Pat gonna use his account scum power to savor this
[0:57:31] <+Kravedarknesss> @jimbobjoe1234 in world war z they did
[0:57:32] <+XavierFoxy> back O Pat lol
[0:57:33] <majima666> it runs pretty well too on base ps4
[0:57:33] <%lewdskeletor13> Dead bodies shit themselves, so zombies probably do too
[0:57:34] <%RaikenTB> QTE time
[0:57:35] <Talyndemon> RE2 Remake looks good. Makes me want a Dino Crisis remake
[0:57:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> dammit
[0:57:37] <%sporeian94> So are they gonna make a RE3 remake?
[0:57:37] <digitialdemidevil> @jimbobjoe1234 technically they would shit themselves as soon as they died, but they probably don't have normal body functions after being zombies
[0:57:37] <dukenux> PAt isn't fit for this demo. A normal gamer would just run around all that stuff, already
[0:57:38] <%ThePuddingDead> i love how there's no encounter yet and its still quiet
[0:57:40] <%SulfurousAcid> Manly Physique
[0:57:41] <cloudextra> How did you get the demo

[0:58:02] <+PelySux22> ada taking a shit
[0:58:04] <+wolfeman1911> I guess that explains the water.
[0:58:05] <+XavierFoxy> did you assume Pats gender?
[0:58:05] <+runegod20> didn't the intro of RE3 take place in like a day or two?

[0:58:12] <digitialdemidevil> Just sent an email to Super Beast Castle
[0:58:13] <Forces45> Didn't the chief basically fuck over the police because he hid the ammo?
[0:58:13] <ScreamingMeat> It's a Douche
[0:58:13] <+wolfeman1911> Though that toilet is overflowing fucking hard.
[0:58:13] <%manwithboxonhead> Try the 7 hour war in Half Life Verse.
[0:58:14] <ASadFrog> Honestly, I'm fine with them fucking up the RPD, it really didn't feel like there had been "room-to-room" battles in RE2
[0:58:14] <+Mexrage> bathrooms in raccoon city police staton!? sacrilege!
[0:58:14] <LiquidMathew> Wait why doesn't Leon know about zombies if its been happening for a fucking week?
[0:58:14] <missingangle> I just got off my shift, I ain't cleaning shit

[0:58:16] <hassanico> Booooo never use that!
[0:58:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> You need First Aid Sprays on the can!
[0:58:17] <+jimbobjoe1234> Another question would also be if a zombie ate enough would it's stomach just explode?
[0:58:17] <blaine_themono> ahahahah monster shitting jumpscare
[0:58:17] <bearalin> Damn I didn’t know that, a whole week geez
[0:58:17] <%CerberusDriver> no need to worry about rankings in this

[0:58:18] <%Hilleltaco> Perfectly clean, rub it all over your wounds
[0:58:20] <$codussalpha> for one week....this police station was ARMAGEDDON.....THERE WAS A FIRE FIGHT!
[0:58:22] <%edgeyberzerker> I like that someone left an f aid spray in the toilet
[0:58:22] <necrocannibal2> Home Sweet Home flashbacks
[0:58:23] <+Kghaleon> Full playthrough is gonna be rad, with Pat's perspective.
[0:58:26] <hassanico> More like never aid spray
[0:58:26] <revzero25> Can you encounter Mr. X in this demo
[0:58:26] <majima666> the rpd didnt have a toilet in the original re2......WORST REMAKE EVER
[0:58:27] <retro_redux> Leon’s first day was supposed to be a week prior to this. Someone told him not to come.
[0:58:28] <+Golkin237> did the media just ignore the outbreak???
[0:58:28] <Huntercd> Call a plumber
[0:58:30] <%jonesyboy_19> Berry Clogged the toilet
[0:58:30] <Tha_Mik> THE RANK PAT
[0:58:30] <%Divryne> Woman.
[0:58:31] <alexandrecau> wipe your ass with first aid spray
[0:58:31] <+SparkAfterDark> the idea that cops with weapons and ammo would still be overrun over the course of a slow grueling week is so much stupider than if it just happened too fast to react to
[0:58:32] <ScreamingMeat> Douche
[0:58:33] <+thepinkestcatgirl> terlet spray
[0:58:33] <%manwithboxonhead> All toilets must die.
[0:58:33] <+N7_KP> YOOOOO
[0:58:34] <dekkitout> doc in a can
[0:58:34] <Rellim80> 12MiNUTES
[0:58:34] <grayjammer> Unatirofa
[0:58:35] <foreverN2dust> I didn't expect this to be so much like RE7
[0:58:40] <King_Doorman> ah yeah, REmake 2's greatest addition... washrooms!
[0:58:40] <ultimate_joker_main> this game looks spooky af WutFace
[0:58:40] <yourliteraldog> We have to assume that all the zombies have undies full of butt junk because T-Virus kills you before turning you into zombie. Therefote it safe to assume that they vioded there bowels upon death
[0:58:41] <pillowwasp> Full play through will take 2 years
[0:58:41] <haterbuns> mirror
[0:58:42] <axtonunbound> then the hell was leon doing or at?
[0:58:42] <GizmoKSX> Unatirofa, Spanish for A Tirofa.
[0:58:43] <mrjammer1999> Its weird seeing a hold function in a resident evil
[0:58:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> @AngriestPat What's the lore behind First Aid Sprays being in the women's bathroom?
[0:58:49] <%CerberusDriver> Time stops when you're paused or in the item menu, stop freaking out, chat.
[0:58:49] <digitialdemidevil> They should have investigated this city during the day
[0:58:51] <+jimbobjoe1234> Like zombies can't digest right? That foods gotta go somewhere.
[0:58:53] <HalcyonJon> thanks guys
[0:58:54] <+HyraFukit> Did any Resident Evil hero smoke?
[0:58:55] <+SparkAfterDark> Death to zombies either happens in moments or over the course of months
[0:58:57] <%brave_sj> BlessRNG
[0:59:01] <AMMuffin> The note we looked at earlier said September 25th. RE3 is September 28th through October 1st. How long did the Feds just kinda let this go?
[0:59:01] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Wouldn’t it be funny if having used a first aid spray in the demo brought down your ranking in the full game?
[0:59:04] <$ooblagis> First zombie in next room
[0:59:06] <+berserkscarlett> I’m nervous
[0:59:06] <scrumbotime> Ah yes, the truest first aid, INCREDIBLY HEAVY DRUGS you just spray all over your wounds
[0:59:07] <VeryTricky> @Doster503 click on your name on the top left, then click subscriptions. it will show you there if its automated or not
[0:59:08] <%brave_sj> OPEN UP PAT

[0:59:08] <$codussalpha> OOOOH! A DOOD
[0:59:09] <%ThePuddingDead> jesus
[0:59:09] <%BioApple> I hope at the end of the thirty minutes a big monster just jumps through the wall and eats you
[0:59:10] <+pickleinspector> this is way scarier than I was expecting
[0:59:11] <lemonhead996> OPEN UP
[0:59:11] <dukenux> Hope it's not... Jesus' BLOOD
[0:59:11] <AggsMK7> RIP that guy
[0:59:11] <%Fluxraw> Jesus confirmed in Capcom universe
[0:59:11] <jackiedan> So I take it that patty is gonna speed run the shit out of this one a few more playthroughs
[0:59:12] <ToneBacas> @ThePuddingDead and having only one shot at this adds so much to the tension. I wonder if you could reproduce this without resorting to the one-shot deal -- imagine every game doing this

[1:09:12] <+Arsene48> That's A LOT
[1:09:13] <+HyraFukit> It could be toned to waste time in the demo!!
[1:09:13] <AdmiralButtloaf> weakass gun
[1:09:13] <arturoware> try again
[1:09:14] <$Order_of_Mystery> why does it take so much?
[1:09:14] <+Mexrage> hopefully there are critical headshots?
[1:09:14] <ketchuo13> 7 headshots to kill one zombie. Well shit
[1:09:15] <JJMR322> thats an absurd amount of headshots
[1:09:16] <SCHllZOPHRENIIC> still not dead BibleThump
[1:09:17] <DraxTD> 60-12 @AngriestPat
[1:09:18] <HypemasterMonty> That's a lot of bullets to kill one fucking zombie for good
[1:09:18] <ScreamingMeat> SHOTGUN
[1:09:18] <roboguy2k> Now Leon is a true cop
[1:09:19] <+Caped_Eggy> You gonna need a bazooka for a licker then LUL

[1:09:20] <%vectorless_peon> whar the heck 7 these things are spongey
[1:09:21] <+SiegeJay> That is a weakass gun
[1:09:21] <%JakeIsNotGross> That's a lot of damgae.
[1:09:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> Well this makes Zombies WAY more frightening
[1:09:21] <%Mev852_> This is why I like .34's
[1:09:21] <TheSpartanThief> Resilient fucking skulls...
[1:09:21] <HarmfulOpinions> Are we gonna get crimson heads though?
[1:09:22] <deadredeyez> time to just watch pat
[1:09:22] <Hydrapissed> Time for leg shots and run
[1:09:22] <zerocruz> Fuck 7 thats a lot
[1:09:22] <mastermidget23> That's durable enough that I can actually see why these zombies are a serious problem even with the existence of guns.
[1:09:22] <Kalcom> time to knee
[1:09:22] <ReapandKnow> damn 7? shit might not be worth killing
[1:09:23] <+runegod20> do the zombies stay around in an area when you leave?
[1:09:23] <+PelySux22> so its better to shoot the legs and run?
[1:09:23] <%ThePuddingDead> i love the procedural damage on the models!
[1:09:24] <%Rngiddion> just the right number so you cant kill 2 with 1 reloard
[1:09:24] <chza> Woolie's streaming guys!
[1:09:24] <+jimbobjoe1234> Noticed a lack of blood puddles in the demo actually
[1:09:24] <BlueLunecy> GUNS Pog
[1:09:24] <%lewdskeletor13> Damn this really is survival horror
[1:09:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Demo must be hard difficulty.
[1:09:25] <+Belakitu> Try knife next? Shot leg stab head?
[1:09:25] <necrocannibal2> more like, resilient evil amirite?
[1:09:26] <+JustToWatch> that almost feels like a glitch
[1:09:27] <%legendscar01> CUSTUM MAGNUM, HAHA
[1:09:27] <GrandmasterBFunk> i fucking love how leon starts swearing when the zombies dont die, its a great touch
[1:09:28] <+demon1103> 7 headshots....thats rediculous
[1:09:29] <%JJCheeker> Well at least there's no shortage of ammo
[1:09:30] <%manwithboxonhead> For all the useless ammo
[1:09:30] <%Weapon901> They might be increased for the demo
[1:09:31] <$imextremelymanly> I swore I say a lets play of just 3 shots before. they must have beffed them up
[1:09:31] <%RaikenTB> red gem
[1:09:32] <+azure22900> So avoid body shots jesus
[1:09:34] <%SilverDevilfish> Was that a beer vending machine?
[1:09:34] <%Kahnicus> Blue Leon Needs Shotty Badly
[1:09:35] <alrobot2014> when it takes 7 headshots to kill a fucker it makes sense that the police got fucked
[1:09:36] <scrumbotime> the question becomes, how accurate do your bullets have to be, like, could they have it where you need an actual brainpan shot to take it down
[1:09:36] <%EdgyMacaroon> 7 shots? that's sucks
[1:09:38] <+Kravedarknesss> these are actual zombies. the brown needs to be fully destroyed
[1:09:39] <+jbfelder> @AngriestPat Aiming for the head doesn't count. You actually gotta get the forehead for close to the brain
[1:09:40] <+scape_goat> TIME CHECK SU1
[1:09:42] <Hidashi13> retcon boyos
[1:09:43] <Dynablade> 7 headshots is insane
[1:09:44] <strangelee> The question is: Do they take 7 Headshots, or just 7 shots?
[1:09:44] <KahunaTuna> is this on the Pro?
[1:09:45] <Palmtuna> Turned her poor head into raw chicken salad
[1:09:45] <LiquidMathew> Record of Events: "Shit got fucked hard"
[1:09:47] <Forces45> Res zombies were always tougher to kill
[1:09:49] <laguerrilha> Look at that RE7 yellow tapes box
[1:09:50] <gyrogogozeppeli> Time
[1:09:52] <%Octopicake> @AngriestPat Do you think they'll have the Albert Wesker desk easter egg in the remake? apatSmug
[1:09:53] <yourliteraldog> Cop guns only work on minorties lesser know fact.
[1:09:56] <+mcjimbo12> GrandmasterBFunk i already really like leon. great facial animation when he was trapped under that door with the zombie, i love how he pounded his fist into the ground when he got caught. a lot of really nice details already
[1:09:56] <+scape_goat> How long left
[1:09:57] <natewinter777> 5 MINS REMAINING
[1:09:57] <%OwlLightningMage> I think Pat is almost out of time LUL
[1:09:58] <+Kghaleon> Damn those refuges.
[1:09:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> That's casual for a death
[1:10:00] <+jimbobjoe1234> Do torso shots have the same amount of damage indication like headshots?
[1:10:00] <ToneBacas> 70 bullets to kill 10 zombies via headshot. insane
[1:10:03] <+SparkAfterDark> Wonder if it matters where in the head you shoot them. Like, forehead and cheeks wouldn't be as good as up through the nose and eyes
[1:10:05] <alejandrogccs> BOO-LLETS
[1:10:05] <classicxgamerz> Is the demo out for ps4 yet?
[1:10:08] <pillowwasp> Pat has 5 minutes
[1:10:08] <+RowenCleric> I mean that is pretty accurate, they took on average 7ish shots in the old game
[1:10:09] <+wolfeman1911> Presumably the cops broke out the shotguns when they were faced with fighting zambos.
[1:10:11] <+JoeStillLife> This is really weird for a time limit. I would understand 1 shot as in death.
[1:10:13] <Arek_1> What difficulty is this?
[1:10:14] <splint3r6> quit fucking reading asshat @AngriestPat
[1:10:16] <slingard1999> i feel like the zombie's are more like the molded in 7 with the weird hp
[1:10:16] <$nademonkey1100> it better be called that dam MUGNUM
[1:10:18] <NerevaRising> 6 bullets.... not enough to kill everything that moves
[1:10:22] <+RioGascar> @angriestpat demos super buggy man. speed running it and skipping cutscenes seems to really fuck with the ps4. Might be a pro thing
[1:10:29] <$imextremelymanly> time running out

[1:11:21] <$imextremelymanly> where is MR. X
[1:11:21] <retro_redux> @splint3r6 Quit being a douchebag
[1:11:22] <$ooblagis> He has 10 accounts
[1:11:23] <pillowwasp> Yellow is the color if climbing
[1:11:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @necrocannibal2 He has 10 tries.

[1:11:26] <HypemasterMonty> Will they explain how Leon learned to do quips for RE4?
[1:11:26] <%CerberusDriver> @necrocannibal2 he has 10 accounts
[1:11:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> Just let him do his thing
[1:11:27] <alrobot2014> nah he's just got 9 more tries @necrocannibal2
[1:11:29] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @scape_goat he's gonna keep trying it through his alt accounts, he's probably gonna speedrun it by the time RE2 actually comes out
[1:11:31] <%joylent_blue> necrocannibal2 he's made many accounts for many replays
[1:11:35] <nekodelic> @necrocannibal2 he has other accounts ready (10 total)

[1:11:36] <curse85> your second pistol you unlock is prolly waaaay better
[1:11:36] <%CJett92> @necrocannibal2 He has 10 accounts set up for this

[1:12:26] <bobbenxd> 5 chest, 7 head???
[1:12:26] <ketchuo13> Probably was weaker or something
[1:12:26] <alwayspronking> wait, 5 for chest, 7 for head??
[1:12:27] <AggsMK7> 2Fat2Live
[1:12:27] <+Verd_254> first one had a hard head
[1:12:27] <kratosdestroys> WAT
[1:12:27] <+spook_knightatx> ooof
[1:12:28] <Hydrapissed> weird
[1:12:28] <BakedBam> he was a fatty boi
[1:12:28] <+jimbobjoe1234> Nice there is some reaction responses on torso shots
[1:12:29] <Kokobro> Thats...weird.
[1:12:29] <+runegod20> how many knife hits will it take to kill him?
[1:12:29] <%RaikenTB> he just wanted a pepsi
[1:12:29] <$imextremelymanly> Why was shooting in the body more effective
[1:12:29] <C_S_N_G> You broke that zombie's heart
[1:12:30] <LiquidMathew> I think window zombie was a stronger one?
[1:12:31] <%Rngiddion> variable health per zombie i guess
[1:12:32] <roboguy2k> Maybe that one lady just had a really hard head
[1:12:32] <TheEnablerr> poor chungy
[1:12:33] <JJMR322> 7 head 5 chest? doesnt make sense
[1:12:33] <yourliteraldog> Do they reanimate?
[1:12:33] <%BlackJack607> Well he was already morbidly obese maybe he had an undead heart attack?
[1:12:33] <+Irridium> center mass son
[1:12:34] <%afronooch> Paul Blart did nothing wrong
[1:12:34] <%patriotrenegade> health probably isn't standardized
[1:12:34] <KungFooMaen> zombie was not as healthy Kappa
[1:12:35] <%Kahnicus> ooo, different size models
[1:12:35] <natewinter777> the fat did not save him
[1:12:36] <Vork88> maybe fat zombies are weaker?
[1:12:36] <+dangerillustrated> Does it depend on where you shoot them in the head?
[1:12:36] <arturoware> Just in case I HEARD some people said that you can't play again on different accounts, the demo appears to be console-locked. Cannot confirm though :O
[1:12:37] <%Jeikujeiku> @AngriestPat it might be like RE7 where the bullets required was random per zombie
[1:12:37] <%fattness132> randomized bullets needed for takedowns?
[1:12:37] <Fujiwara_92> PAUL BLART DEFEATED LuL
[1:12:37] <+mcjimbo12> AngriestPat a lot of recent shooters do more damage to the chest than head, it's very common these last few years
[1:12:37] <%Bum_Skull> He probably had the gout
[1:12:38] <+Trtickster> Do zombies have varying health maybe?
[1:12:38] <Hydrapissed> 5 chest 7 head da fauq
[1:12:38] <+Kravedarknesss> @yourliteraldog yes they can. even some .22 can pierce a skull
[1:12:39] <+g8rhead> you shot him in his bloated oversized heart
[1:12:40] <%CubicPhantom> knife science go time
[1:12:40] <+Blue256> fat ones are weaker...? weird game logic
[1:12:40] <+WhyIDie> what if damage is semi-random and determined by the body area
[1:12:40] <HypemasterMonty> How is it more to the ehad than chest?
[1:12:41] <+azure22900> So HEART shots does more damage?
[1:12:41] <+Kuro_Koshka> !time
[1:12:42] <+Buzzkill983> The bullets loosened his artery clog, and it went right to his brain
[1:12:42] <bignerb> maybe random?
[1:12:44] <Heyestus> randomised damage thresholds
[1:12:44] <$ooblagis> The first zombie may be extra tough for the OH SHIT factor
[1:12:45] <%JJCheeker> Time for shotgun
[1:12:47] <TheMeromex> makes no sece, 7 to the head but 5 to the chest?
[1:12:47] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s probably randomized
[1:12:48] <%BioApple> zombies don't need complex nervous systems but they still probably need blood
[1:12:49] <rufus2k2> chief irons is at it again
[1:12:49] <$Tuskor13> i think even his facecam has delay
[1:12:50] <yourliteraldog> I thought that was a thing
[1:12:52] <GoldeNOVA> Random health values
[1:12:55] <%FrostMass22> Pat just murdered Kevin James, he wasn't even a zombie
[1:12:55] <Dieworc> maybe each zombie takes diffrent hits?
[1:12:57] <DeathByGeek> its random
[1:12:57] <+chexmixisbest> @WhyIDie that sounds about right
[1:13:01] <Zedimonx5> Rng zombie health?
[1:13:02] <Worldbrand> Health RNG or bullet RNG?
[1:13:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> 7 to the head and 5 to the chest makes sense.
[1:13:07] <dukenux> Just brute force it 4head

[1:40:53] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer200 hey pat. I've noticed that when i watch twitch on mobile, some streams i can shove into a movable surface window, like some YouTube videos. This stream is not one of them. If this is a setting on your end, pls fix, i want to play yugioh in the background. Also, Hi Paige! When you start streaming again, the next time you read fanfiction, why not read some 4chan greentexts too? I can recommend some sources if you want, and there's one I KNOW you'll love, it's called "The BONE Star"
[1:40:54] <Highwang> and thus the demo was nuked

[1:44:51] <%TheSpiritof2277> Chungus had a hard life
[1:44:52] <+azure22900> Shooting the spine would completely disable them
[1:44:52] <Geno4344> I want the fat zombies to blow up when you shoot them in the gut

[1:45:04] <%umbypokochan> gotta go fast SANIC!!
[1:45:05] <+runegod20> so what's the minimum amount of zombies you can kill in the game?
[1:45:07] <%kamen_advent> There's a locker you can open with the knife in the first hallway
[1:45:08] <squeebert22> in the old school zombie tier list It goes Normal zombies, then Hat zombies then finally naked lab zombies
[1:45:15] <Hellarussian> you're a loose cannon Leon
[1:45:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Shaggy087 Headshots aren't better.
[1:45:16] <321Continue> @th3smartalec RIGHT

[1:45:32] <pullmydeviltriggerbaby> Is this a SPEEDRUN?
[1:45:33] <Geno4344> We need some fast zombies from REMake
[1:45:40] <AlterdBit> @KevinDiavolo You can
[1:45:42] <AdmiralButtloaf> @jonesyboy_19 Cheif Irons could be trans. We havent seen them yet
[1:45:42] <%sparrrow_> Also the notebook you got has the answer to that upstairs puzzle
[1:45:43] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer200 I was playing a game with my friend where we have to slowly 1up each other in worse sayings, following some other rules. For the first time in a while, he beat me, with "botoxing your balls 'till they're as smooth as Pat's head". This gave me an idea, someone should start a crowdfunding thing, to be paid to Pat, on the stipulation that he shaves. All of it. ALL OF IT. We can have Paige check from off camera on another stream.
[1:45:43] <%ShaneWhite> Hi Paige

[2:00:03] <ACDC246> Try headshotting near the top of the head, it may work due to the brain location.

[2:03:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> What year was 98?
[2:03:37] <%ramielthe5th> its a small town
[2:03:38] <stardustno1r> C´mon pat
[2:03:39] <sodium_station> they weren't super common
[2:03:39] <%Idziman> cell phones weren't invented yet

[2:03:41] <dukenux> 98 had cellphones LUL
[2:03:42] <GUNxSPECTRE> Why would someone that far away work that Raccoon City?
[2:03:42] <+grumbleroar> And no, they weren't as common.
[2:03:43] <thefgcwasamistake> The level to detail in the gore and fucking sick Kreygasm

[2:03:46] <+XxBTExX> not really common
[2:03:46] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s not a small town
[2:03:47] <disflipmat> Small mountain town in 98, probably not
[2:03:47] <agadejobi> They were super UNCOMMMON in 98
[2:03:48] <%legendscar01> This game teaches you that being late to work is okay

[2:03:50] <%jonesyboy_19> Umbrella cut the communications to the city
[2:03:51] <%Kaialb> @AngriestPat the irony is that it's a 6 hour drive to montreal from nyc, so it might as well be montreal/racoon city

[2:15:01] <DarkKnightGrave> Lt. Tofu
[2:15:01] <+Destructive_Forces> Hewwo?
[2:15:01] <$imextremelymanly> time to experiment
[2:15:01] <GrandmasterBFunk> you gonna play leon or jill first when the full game is out?
[2:15:02] <PSI_Guy95> Apparently Tofu was a test model in RE2 and implemented as a bonus mode? That's nuts
[2:15:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> That's deep
[2:15:02] <%jonesyboy_19> Its loud
[2:15:03] <Ubu2933> the best boy is probably guarding the magnum
[2:15:04] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah no Claire demo
[2:15:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Guess I'm not crazy
[2:15:06] <Agent_Sampson> Please do it
[2:15:06] <+MechaBaphomet> Test more body destruction
[2:15:08] <%jaggiesama> lol right games easy
[2:15:08] <+asgard147> good question
[2:15:10] <+SPKTR34> @Th3SmartAlec do not worry my child
[2:15:10] <Guardiansaiyan> DEAD
[2:15:10] <$awsomesaucekirby> Vegan zombies have a +50 pretentious stat increase over their normal and more common counterparts
[2:15:14] <$SGrim> Eat me rooGasm
[2:15:14] <%CerberusDriver> does that mean theres Akuma mode :)
[2:15:14] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @GrandmasterBFunk you mean Claire?
[2:15:14] <GrandmasterBFunk> *claire not jill haha
[2:15:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @GrandmasterBFunk Jill isn't in this game. He's doing Claire first.
[2:15:16] <escourtmission> Leon is too cute to die
[2:15:16] <iNZANE0ne> I would know what dying looks like
[2:15:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> LET'S FIND OUT
[2:15:19] <%Remery_> Show me what death looks like :)
[2:15:20] <sodium_station> i would never just lay halfway through a security door like that
[2:15:21] <+wolfeman1911> I do not like how they made Leon look on this.
[2:15:22] <Haz_Matt_> thought he was getting philosophical for a second
[2:15:22] <dero45> Better have some crazy deaths
[2:15:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Since everybody else in the world is doing Leon first.
[2:15:24] <%Jpdodds> it probably SUCKS
[2:15:25] <+asgard147> let's find out :)
[2:15:31] <$Billyuppercut0> Dying is painful :(
[2:15:34] <+runegod20> can you see if a zombie can grab you from a boarded up window when they put their arms through?
[2:15:36] <SchroedingersFerret> I want Leon to just make RE4 noises.
[2:15:38] <+unfoldingchoas> Do it coward
[2:15:39] <bamcc2> Dying looks like Dying Kappa
[2:15:41] <cyberjellies> aw man.. it's wishful thinkin since it's so close to the release but claire demo would be neat
[2:15:42] <%frenchpooper> dying is overrated tbh
[2:15:46] <slingard1999> the only differance i have seen in this demo compaired to the e3 is the lack of the extended mag upgrade spawn
[2:15:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat does body destruction everytime he drinks Red Bull
[2:15:48] <Your_Lost_Eraser> You go quiet forever ad then see "you can now play as luigi"
[2:15:49] <Gelmibson> i long to find out what dying looks like :)
[2:15:53] <%hidef_sarge> i feel like what does dying look like is a much deeper question then was meant
[2:15:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> Leons die when they are killed
[2:15:55] <%CubicPhantom> he would have saved the whole town and gotten his ass a Presidential Medal of Fuck Yeah
[2:15:56] <+SWFanatic> Thats pat's signature pick up line. "Hey girl. I want to test out some body destruction. You dtf?"
[2:15:57] <%InsaneJackLondon> people die if they are kill
[2:15:58] <%SulfurousAcid> have we come to a conclusion if headshots matter?
[2:15:59] <%lewdskeletor13> Umbrella covered it up
[2:16:01] <Tha_Mik> nomnomnom

[2:16:14] <+ilasper1> WutFace
[2:16:14] <+Dakuu75> CAN YOU SHOOT THE TV?!
[2:16:15] <$awsomesaucekirby> Dying MAY be painful, but being dead means you can't suffer ever again
[2:16:18] <%jiin6> Love him PAT
[2:16:20] <Ran196> F
[2:16:20] <%RilsRislan> It looks like they changed it so that he got a call before his first time and they told him to take another week before coming in, so he arrives a week later, by the time shit hit the fan.

[2:21:35] <+DukeAtomic> Is the layout of this the same as the original or has it been changed
[2:21:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The shotgun being in the demo really helps.
[2:21:36] <CaptainPigeon17> How many times has he played the demo?
[2:21:45] <%RilsRislan> He's on run 3?
[2:21:45] <+Destructive_Forces> Yeah yeah you gotta get the evil zombie fluids out of their ballsacks Leon

[2:21:47] <Guardiansaiyan> lol
[2:21:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @DukeAtomic It's been changed and all the puzzles are new.

[2:22:14] <+runegod20> i feel like they would give him dialogue if you hold the gun over him for awhile
[2:22:15] <$imextremelymanly> you'll get to shoot him in the full game

[2:24:50] <+RC_S3kshun8> @AngriestPat It might have something to do with Zombies start with X pool of health. Some may aesthetically start with damaged limbs, then you do X % damage to incap them
[2:24:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Koagz You super can.

[2:25:25] <OhioNitsud> your friendly neighborhood shotgun
[2:25:26] <%SulfurousAcid> @AngriestPat did you read the shotgun descrption?
[2:25:26] <%RilsRislan> PGO shotguns are garbo tho

[2:25:58] <Ran196> thats a sexy shotgun
[2:25:59] <$ooblagis> Leon's desk is in the bullpen, the area with all the desks and an office off to the side. Also the room with the quick demo exit
[2:26:00] <+Promessa_EX> that shotgun magazine should hold at least 5 + 1 in chamber
[2:26:02] <%lewdskeletor13> He’s on his third
[2:26:02] <%JJCheeker> seexy
[2:26:04] <+FujiSyusuke808Live> That looks awful. Frozen in time and then just slap some lumber over the window in zero seconds flat.
[2:26:04] <+wolfeman1911> @Fenlig I think this is the first fake one.

[2:26:59] <$ooblagis> Melty zombie heads
[2:27:01] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Actually depending on the caliber it might.
[2:27:01] <+wolfeman1911> Show peach the locker!
[2:27:02] <%waifuauthority> If it's JHP round it actually might
[2:27:02] <+cgmerryo> a pistol would definitely do that to a soft head
[2:27:03] <%jaggiesama> it totally would
[2:27:04] <JamesDragon> hello
[2:27:04] <+g8rhead> she had termites
[2:27:07] <+Vejolta> it could. specially since you shot multiple times
[2:27:07] <+Dakuu75> I bet a pistol COULD do that, if you tryed. you jsut gotta believe
[2:27:07] <themagic_conch> leons reeeeaally good
[2:27:08] <%Eternal_Nihilism> enough bullets would
[2:27:09] <KeystoneA1> Higher caliber pistol might
[2:27:09] <Fujiwara_92> it would tho
[2:27:10] <OhioNitsud> seems that headsplit is exclusive to that zambie
[2:27:10] <%DONGWAVE> depends on the pistol
[2:27:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Gogogolem Not a 9mm.
[2:27:12] <Stewbedale> a 9mm would not do that
[2:27:12] <$Hiro01231> You should look up pistol damage to fruits
[2:27:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> is it true, that there is a place in a mans heat, that if you shoot it it will explode?
[2:27:13] <agadejobi> That looks like the work of Hokuto Shinken to me
[2:27:13] <dukenux> Wel
[2:27:15] <Xel_Gel> I mean a rotten corpse being shot might do that
[2:27:16] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@FujiSyusuke808Live) (warning)
[2:27:16] <+ack101> break the statue
[2:27:16] <%jonesyboy_19> The Hangun Hp could do that but the Matilda 9mm too small
[2:27:16] <%jaggiesama> after a few rounds
[2:27:17] <natebud> You did shot her like three times in the head, definitely soften her skull up a bit
[2:27:18] <$Dotta5> Lancer key
[2:27:19] <%snow_bush> Well, time to go shower so I stop smelling of Gym sweat
[2:27:19] <%JJCheeker> re2 needs "blooy mess" perk
[2:27:20] <%ECRead> a pistol can absolutely do that
[2:27:21] <KeystoneA1> +p or HP rounds could also do it
[2:27:23] <%CubicPhantom> haha no

[2:27:44] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer200 smash spirits are cool, I just wish they had a text page to go with them like trophies did. Although they do kinda have lore shit involved, such as the Naked Snake spirit evolving into Big Boss, the medusa spirit can evolve from her classic look, to her kid Icarus uprising one. Or how the Paz spirit has you start with a bomb in hand.

[2:43:18] <%Caidezes> Xehanort is a creepy old man that hangs out with kids all day and disguises himself as other trustworthy adults.
[2:43:19] <Mr_LupLup> Great, now I need to delete that useless info outta my brain
[2:43:19] <stabby_jenkins> SNAP
[2:43:20] <+KrippSubBot> Kingdom hearts is the story of an old man desperately trying to get himself inside of young boys.
[2:43:21] <DonatelloJose> Booooooo
[2:43:22] <%CrimsonCore90> Someone say albed?
[2:43:23] <revzero25> Somebody say ALBEDS
[2:43:25] <%sparrrow_> I love how the only thing that could have made KH more complicated was time travel and they fucking added it
[2:43:34] <yourliteraldog> Praise be to yevon
[2:43:37] <%rad_rice> i want to live in the alternate universe where the plot complexities of KH and animal crossing are swapped
[2:43:39] <Angry_Ev1L> KH is a story of dumb anime bullshit
[2:43:43] <%Implosivestar> albed !raffle
[2:43:46] <%psychodave1234> FILTY ALBEDS BREDDUH
[2:43:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> I think it'd be better if you could just kick both Donald and Goofy out of the party like Vaan
[2:43:49] <%finaltrinity5> damn one man's donation should not have tilted twitch chat so hard
[2:43:51] <%InsaneJackLondon> this is some spot on KH lore
[2:43:52] <%Kahnicus> Kingdoms Hearts 24/7/365 + square root of 96 cubed
[2:43:55] <%finaltrinity5> stay classy, twitch chat
[2:43:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Nobody knows what the fuck Kingdom Hearts is going on about because they insist on jamming gameboy games between the canon of the main story
[2:43:56] <ZaibatsuFan> What music is this?
[2:43:56] <%JJCheeker> No Steve Buscemi love on the BRB screen?
[2:43:56] <DonatelloJose> Grand wizard Waka presiding
[2:43:57] <00ichi00> Hey did he get re2 demo going
[2:43:58] <Tha_Mik> Oh it changed
[2:44:00] <Mangahero18> Being Dumb Anime Bullshit is what makes KH Great.
[2:44:03] <Mangahero18> Like JoJo
[2:44:05] <%CrimsonCore90> We need to clense them with blitzbad bruddah
[2:44:06] <yourliteraldog> It's the Albeds
[2:44:11] <revzero25> Brudda we need to get rid of those filthy albeds they are runing bliztball
[2:44:14] <kumokalt> aeroS
[2:44:16] <CastellanVon> KH isn't an example of good writing but dammit if I don't want to play KH3 as soon as it's released.
[2:44:18] <+Dakuu75> Lemmy know when KH666 comes out and you play as Ansem
[2:44:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The handheld games are part of the main story.
[2:44:21] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Mangahero18 I'll drink to that.
[2:44:23] <Conky89> Better dumb anime bullshit that creepy anime bullshit am I right?
[2:44:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You just don't want to accept that.
[2:44:29] <Conky89> *than
[2:44:38] <%Eternal_Nihilism> @00ichi00 he beat it a few times already.
[2:44:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I played KH all the way through and had NO FUCKING IDEA what the fuck was happening in two for like four hours
[2:44:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> There were no Al Behds nominated for the Golden Spheres this season. SHAME
[2:44:42] <Mr_LupLup> All I want from KH is for them to release the game that ties the whole plot tohether. On the gameboy color
[2:44:51] <DonatelloJose> @zaibatsufan it’s not from a game, it’s some artist who gave pat permission to use it.
[2:44:52] <%BKNPham> this is a long pee
[2:44:54] <FracturedImage> !raffle
[2:44:55] <+KrippSubBot> They remade the only important mobile one for ps2, and the others just watch the movie
[2:44:57] <noeluser> did pat beat the demo?
[2:44:57] <Tha_Mik> Where does the kh parking lot video fit in the lore?
[2:44:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> The gameboy had good games
[2:44:59] <Angry_Ev1L> KH fans are just like FATE fans that were thinking that woolie will like it lol but did you see the transformationns? lmao LUL
[2:45:05] <%Caidezes> Everything Square makes is dumb anime bullshit. People love it all regardless.
[2:45:06] <%ElenaManetta> The BRB video music puts me to sleep. You need something with more BLAMS and EXPLOSIONS
[2:45:06] <escourtmission> Pat is passing a kidney stone
[2:45:06] <Brofarian> The thing is KH has like 7-8 installments. There's no series with that many parts that you could give an offhand plot synopsis of without it sounding complicated. When you get all the information piece by piece over the course of individual 30-40 hour games it's not that hard to absorb.
[2:45:07] <%cvp5127> @Dakuu75 dont even joke about that nomura might be listening
[2:45:07] <TheAmazingClaytor> Real question from an outsider. What's more confusing? MGS or KH?
[2:45:10] <%Kahnicus> KH seems to be an example of retroactively trying to cram too much god damned story into what was not supposed to be that complicated in the first place
[2:45:10] <%afronooch> @Mr_LupLup nah, commodore 64
[2:45:10] <%hidef_sarge> aaaaaaa
[2:45:13] <%rad_rice> @Tha_Mik that's KH2
[2:45:13] <%JJCheeker> hiiiii

[2:47:01] <Zantetzuken> hard boiled drama

[2:47:23] <PineappleBison> Hype
[2:47:24] <Mangahero18> Yea it was. That Demo made it look like RE is a horror series or something.
[2:47:25] <%Hilleltaco> It's almost as if he's
[2:47:26] <%NobleJedi> Chungus Chan!
[2:47:27] <%Hilleltaco> EVERYWHERE
[2:47:28] <%Katmon27> i miss the different stances in kiwami 2 :(
[2:47:30] <blue6sub6remnant6> I'm excited for Majima everywhere. And what a rolling start we're off to tonight.
[2:47:33] <%sparrrow_> white or gray
[2:47:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Kiryu's suit is gray not white.
[2:47:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Fuck are these Twunk doing fighting wit the shrits on
[2:47:35] <+zaworldo> sO is there a reason pat avoids using dragon style? or is it just coincidence
[2:47:36] <%jaa0518> no. I like wandering around a city and getting into wacky hijinks.
[2:47:36] <Hazard_Kujacker> F U N K G O E S O N
[2:47:36] <%Implosivestar> welcome to the WARM UP PHASE CHEWIE
[2:47:36] <stabby_jenkins> I smell em!
[2:47:39] <Mr_Strut> The fuck is Majima's deal?
[2:47:40] <circular7> the bromance continues <3
[2:47:41] <rosencruez> PAIGIMA
[2:47:49] <Mangahero18> When we all know the REAL RE is about dumb goofy bullshit and annoying game mechanics.
[2:47:52] <LuisKingKing> I bought this and you make the combat look so easy I’m so bad at this
[2:47:53] <MonstrousVisage> Dragon style sucks until you get almost all the upgrades
[2:47:54] <%psychodave1234> yo what the fuck is up with bits why cant i drop any
[2:47:56] <%rad_rice> @Mr_Strut his deal is that he's everywhere
[2:47:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie Really? It's an awfully light shade of grey then
[2:48:00] <%NovaKnightmare> Good thing Majima is impossible to kill
[2:48:00] <Squidbit> oooohaaawwh
[2:48:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Majimas whole deal is gay sex and nipple play
[2:48:03] <Tha_Mik> ORRRAA
[2:48:04] <%ShaneWhite> Depends
[2:48:05] <+SiegeJay> Is PAt playing on Hard? Looks too easy
[2:48:08] <NerevaRising> Majima caught me trying to buy weird porn...
[2:48:10] <jackpackattack96> MR.SHAKEDOWN
[2:48:11] <%JJCheeker> he's like iron
[2:48:14] <bearwagon> Kiwami means health regen
[2:48:16] <%Metalwahl> that's rad
[2:48:19] <circular7> use heat moves to stop healing moves!
[2:48:20] <stabby_jenkins> OOOAUUUGH
[2:48:22] <CastellanVon> Hard Mode is just tedious in Kiwami 1
[2:48:24] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Mr_Strut He had the troubles in his past, but he becomes the Mark Hamill facade to numb his pain.
[2:48:25] <alexandrecau> that kiwami gimmick is more annoying than anything
[2:48:38] <%rad_rice> gotta inflate the runtime of this 2005 game
[2:48:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Majima wit the Philly shell
[2:48:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> EXTREME
[2:48:46] <shieldecho> im on chapter 11 and am trying to max out majima. its getting kind of draining
[2:48:47] <%aivalera> Kiwami makes Kiryu look all tysun-tsun with majima. "I wasn't looking for a fight, b-baka."
[2:48:48] <%hidef_sarge> you knocked his jaw off
[2:48:49] <Scribbles69 > waiting for max to stream the demo now
[2:48:50] <Mangahero18> Kiwami means MAJIMA EVERYWHERE SYSTEM.
[2:48:51] <%snow_bush> Extreme!
[2:48:51] <%Aleate> That looks like it hit him in the neck D:
[2:48:53] <%psychodave1234> seriously is anyone else unable to drop bits?
[2:48:54] <%Implosivestar> you countered him out of that sway so hard he didn't even move SICK
[2:48:54] <PineappleBison> Radical
[2:48:55] <%lewdskeletor13> THATS RAD
[2:48:55] <+Yokuho> sbfpO sbfpU sbfpN sbfpO sbfpO sbfpO
[2:48:56] <rosencruez> bwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[2:48:57] <silverglove2012> majima
[2:48:58] <%IAmAkiva> When do you dab on the rival gangs?
[2:48:59] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat don't interrupt a combo for a kiwami move, you get much more heat for finishing the combo
[2:49:02] <+zaworldo> Is there a reason pat avoids using dragon style? or is it just a choice
[2:49:04] <$SGrim> rooDab
[2:49:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> Majima loves his fuck-fights even more than Catwoman
[2:49:05] <stabby_jenkins> BBBWWAAAAA
[2:49:08] <kumokalt> aeroNice
[2:49:10] <%Katmon27> i think if you do a full combo and then use the kiwami move it does more damage
[2:49:13] <%sparrrow_> then you get a cock point
[2:49:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Almost out of the baby bitch ranks.
[2:49:14] <yourliteraldog> So what are Kiryu's favorite crimes? Besides assault and battery
[2:49:20] <Naho_Saenoki> @zaworldo Dragon style is kinda not great.
[2:49:22] <Prevot> almost beat the CP out of majima
[2:49:28] <sileo_patronus> @zaworldo it currently sucks is why
[2:49:29] <%lewdskeletor13> Kiryu HATES crimes
[2:49:30] <CastellanVon> Dragon style sucks dick always
[2:49:32] <OkamiDude15> @zaworldo dragon style is basically worthless untill you have a shit ton of its abilities unlocked by fighting majima
[2:49:33] <stabby_jenkins> Extrotion
[2:49:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Dragon Style kicks ass but you need to level it up first.
[2:49:35] <theangryguyofde> @zaworldo Dragon style is terrible until it gets upgrades from two sidequests
[2:49:37] <cherrycottontail> I wish the Majima Everywhere system was in more games
[2:49:41] <alexandrecau> Kiryu'S favorite crime is breaking bicycles
[2:49:45] <+Gooniekorn> yeaaa

[3:18:22] <BeefyQueefer> You can't commit crimes in Yakuza guys, settle down
[3:18:39] <doodledumps> Kiryu would never do crimes. It's not like he's a Yakuzi or nuthin'
[3:18:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Reminder that Beast Style has a heat move for stunned people too.

[3:26:05] <+Hamblasto> In fairness, he probably really wouldn't have gotten very far after your first fight
[3:26:07] <+RC_S3kshun8> @JLJWinner good call
[3:26:07] <%Raxus_Secundus> Much Majima
[3:26:09] <Ghost__Pantsu> Majima is literately everywhere
[3:26:11] <%CubicPhantom> he even had his health bar enhanced for your benefit
[3:26:12] <flame_of_udun_> They really meant Everywhere guys
[3:26:14] <%Implosivestar> how long until we get the Majima sub emote @AngriestPat ?
[3:26:16] <+KrippSubBot> My favorite is when he hides under the giant traffic cone.
[3:26:18] <Triplicat> is he an easy fight or is pat just doing good
[3:26:18] <$codussalpha> you know he's not serious cause he still has his jacket on
[3:26:24] <%AzirothTheGreat> and they don't stop coming

[3:26:38] <%JLJWinner> It not a question of if he is going to be around that corner. He is around all corners.
[3:26:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Triplicat Pat is doing good but he also starts out easy. Majima gets harder every time you fight him. Like Mr. Shakedown.
[3:26:44] <+KrippSubBot> @triplicat he’s pretty easy, gets harder as the game goes on

[3:37:38] <Endocrom> I just got the alert too, I guess it was 3 hours ago.
[3:37:39] <CuttleCrow> x-trem
[3:37:43] <digitialdemidevil> Majima is all up in those guts pat
[3:37:45] <%maskedriderhero> Majime is ready to fight even before the wounds from their last fight stop bleeding
[3:37:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You think that's corn flakes? It's Majima you're eating.
[3:37:47] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Also consider doing Bowling, darts, pool, batting, even Pocket Racing and MesuKing, all of these have Majima mini-game fights required for level ups
[3:37:49] <+axebird> @AirlineFood74 I kind've expected him to be playing it over and over again in a dazed stupor tbh
[3:37:50] <%sparrrow_> Majima must have GREAT dental insurance
[3:37:53] <+jorgamund> if you pause and start up RE2, Majima will be in the police station
[3:37:54] <gyrogogozeppeli> Sasuga
[3:37:54] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat was that a belly to belly suplex?? there more wrestling moves he can do?
[3:37:56] <seylumiue> Bike chan tried to catch majima
[3:37:56] <dekkitout> kiwami means majima everywhere
[3:38:03] <+Plankman> That's what you get for ambushing him from the nouveau riche man
[3:38:05] <%poseidon2> Majima is the fucking best
[3:38:06] <+Hamblasto> Don't stomp his dick. He needs to use that later... with Kiryu
[3:38:09] <%magmameow> kiwami means WHOS TALKING
[3:38:11] <digitialdemidevil> So can I ask you guys can you turn off Majima everywhere?
[3:38:12] <+SiegeJay> @AngriestPat Karoke Time?
[3:38:12] <Claxter_> rank D
[3:38:15] <GameXful2> inb4 KIRYU CHAN
[3:38:15] <%jiin6> Majima Loves you
[3:38:18] <%Remery_> Why does he moan after the beating? :/
[3:38:18] <%ReallyRedRum> It stops being a surprise attack if you do it every 10 minutes
[3:38:20] <%CubicPhantom> kiwami means greatest love story ever told
[3:38:20] <digitialdemidevil> Is that something you can do in the game?
[3:38:20] <+SparkAfterDark> twas a ruse!
[3:38:20] <+RC_S3kshun8> Oh my gosh still rank D? How many times have we fought Majima at this point? like 25?
[3:38:22] <%maskedriderhero> I just want Kiryu to fight like, a mini-boss character
[3:38:24] <%Big_Dream> is only 10k
[3:38:24] <AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat gib karoake
[3:38:26] <person181> no they aren't
[3:38:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah you have to do all the minigames if you want to max out the Dragon Style/Majima levels.
[3:38:27] <%Big_Dream> meh
[3:38:30] <%TheFilth> You're walking in the woods, there's no one around and your phone is dead. Out of the corner of your eye you spot him... GORO MAJIMA
[3:38:32] <seylumiue> @Remery_ you know why
[3:38:33] <%sparrrow_> only like 13
[3:38:34] <GameXful2> Yeah do karaoke pat
[3:38:38] <%maskedriderhero> and just as he's introduced, Majime jumps in, decks the mini boss, and fights Kiryu
[3:38:39] <%InsaneJackLondon> Kiwami means DO MESU KING
[3:38:40] <$ooblagis> That was like the 13th time
[3:38:40] <pfcsoup> anyone hear when Yakuza 3 HD is supposed to come out in the west?
[3:38:41] <digitialdemidevil> Anyone I just want to know if it's possible to play this game without Majima everywhere on
[3:38:44] <Reanimator83> This is fight club the video game. Kiryu isn’t really fighting anyone
[3:38:46] <+Plankman> i love when kiryu literally goes beast mode with his big dumb wide punches
[3:38:52] <GameXful2> PAT KARAOKE PLS
[3:38:53] <$ooblagis> To max him out, you need like 50
[3:38:58] <CuttleCrow> I like how its "only 13" too
[3:38:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> That one guy straight up had a death rattle
[3:38:59] <mayorrev> That's How Yakuza Works
[3:39:04] <+KrippSubBot> @digitialdemidevil no, this is blasphemy.
[3:39:08] <+SparkAfterDark> I'm just going to swing my arms around and if you walk into it it's your own fault
[3:39:24] <+SiegeJay> @digitialdemidevil Yes. You can just fill his meter doing a mini game and that will turn him off temporary til you progress the story
[3:39:25] <$ooblagis> But beating him gets MUCH faster after Tiger Drop
[3:39:26] <Jarvanii> @digitialdemidevil you can avoid the majima fights that you have to do to get him to appear randomyl again
[3:39:33] <+Plankman> is this a christmas story reference
[3:39:34] <flame_of_udun_> octoSad
[3:39:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> She's a stoner

[4:05:49] <+combomaniadeluxe> sbfpSOB sbfpSOB sbfpSOB
[4:05:51] <%TheShal> YEEEE AH
[4:05:51] <%CrimsonCore90> Prepare for tbe next battle!
[4:05:54] <%rad_rice> now that's a combo
[4:05:54] <CybertronPrime> Here comes a new challenger!
[4:05:56] <bearwagon> unfortunately those are easily telegraphed and u'll find out later why
[4:05:57] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat oh..he just fuckingshows up...that means ya gotta do EVERY fight encounter.
[4:06:02] <%Keyd00d> Just wait til Majima starts invading STORY BATTLES
[4:06:02] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat I think it's if you get in a fight in a area you didn't find him yet. rooThink
[4:06:02] <+zaworldo> I forget did he buy the beast kiwami move?
[4:06:03] <CastellanVon> Man Beast mode gains like no heat
[4:06:21] <%lewdskeletor13> @keyd00d He did at the funeral already
[4:06:22] <$samuraifriend> the "random" fights with sudden talking before them means a majima will pop in
[4:06:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> More heat w/ objects grabbed I'd imagine
[4:06:32] <%jiin6> bits of majima ARE EVERYWHERE
[4:06:33] <%ThatGuyfromMars> man is this majima like matt murdock? He's like a punch sponge
[4:06:33] <%RilsRislan> That girl is standing there clapping happily
[4:06:34] <%Give_Me_Liberty> Pat you're gonna eat shit
[4:06:36] <DarkKnightGrave> They nerfed Beast into the ground.
[4:06:36] <godzookylives> Is Majima's skeleton made out of adamantium?
[4:06:37] <%Keyd00d> @lewdskeletor13 shit, that's true
[4:06:42] <%AncelDeLambert> man, this fight with Majima is intense, Kiryu is getting SUPER hungry
[4:06:46] <%CubicPhantom> i guess love can blossom on the battlefield of Kamurocho streets
[4:06:47] <AirlineFood74> @RilsRislan She LOVES it
[4:06:47] <dekkitout> no, but his bat is
[4:06:48] <%ReallyRedRum> use the bike

[4:07:10] <+SpamKingRathalos> HEALING FACTOR
[4:07:10] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat dat looked like a purple krabby patty
[4:07:11] <+zaworldo> WAY TO WASTE IT PAT
[4:07:11] <%Give_Me_Liberty> the headbutt is great
[4:07:14] <%Afterman_> he gained it all back
[4:07:15] <spire6> don't fuck with this Majima
[4:07:16] <%Give_Me_Liberty> but it's no tiger drop
[4:07:26] <%Give_Me_Liberty> which if i bet anything pat will immediately grind to get
[4:07:26] <slothslayer828> nobody wins with a headbutt
[4:07:28] <$Mendin> Pat this is why you carry a Tauriner
[4:07:28] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> Anything big you can grab in beast style?
[4:07:33] <%EdgyMacaroon> never use heat moves pat it's always a waste
[4:07:38] <%gunplagoat> Hey Pat any chance we may see re2 tonight ?
[4:07:38] <%Afterman_> taunted lmao
[4:07:38] <flame_of_udun_> Slugger Majima is a pain in the ass
[4:07:45] <TyrantBelial> block/dodge it his bat swings go through everything
[4:07:49] <gyrogogozeppeli> @gunplagoat hes done
[4:07:49] <%Give_Me_Liberty> rush style him
[4:07:53] <+Blankets_and_Tea> @gunplagoat you missed it, he played earlier
[4:07:55] <%Mornaka> @gunplagoat you missed it
[4:07:57] <TyrantBelial> Well his Home Run Swing anyways
[4:08:03] <%Niney_Who> FIRECRACKERS
[4:08:04] <%faegbeard> you can't just trade with slugger majima pat you gotta learn to dodge
[4:08:06] <Vorpalking> Pat learned dodge!
[4:08:06] <benjiFG> get the tiger cheese drop
[4:08:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> !uptime
[4:08:07] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 8m.
[4:08:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat So it doesn't seem like you noticed this but the Kiwami style prompt is always the color Majima is using. Thug -> Brawler. Breaker -> Rush. Slugger -> Beast.
[4:08:12] <%EdgyMacaroon> rush dodge to build heat
[4:08:14] <gyrogogozeppeli> Oof
[4:08:15] <%Give_Me_Liberty> KI WA Mi
[4:08:17] <%TheFilth> O O F
[4:08:18] <ElectricBoomerang> Majima's got more super armor than Brolly
[4:08:21] <+zaworldo> YO
[4:08:25] <%InsaneJackLondon> EXTREME
[4:08:25] <%Remery_> He likes the foot
[4:08:27] <+augurgewalt> i hope pat is excited for every fight to get shimano-long even with the kiwami heat-moves
[4:08:27] <$Mendin> 100% boner achieved
