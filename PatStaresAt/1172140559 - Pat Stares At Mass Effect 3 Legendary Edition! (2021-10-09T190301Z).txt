[0:09:22] <moonmintparadise> playing it rn its great
[0:09:23] <Treasure_Vault> You thinking about adding the old 2d metroids to the schedule list? Zero Mission and Fusion?
[0:09:24] <%scaryboisupreme> Woolie is like my friend who loves Metroid but has never played a Metroid game
[0:09:24] <%RealThiele> i found out who the sugar baby was im content
[0:09:25] <stantheman_97> woolie will play it in 4 years
[0:09:28] <@TheYellowcouch> Metroid starts at dread
[0:09:28] <%Ancopro> damn chat lookin submissive and brandable today

[0:09:35] <%Treuan> Smile and optimism: gone
[0:09:36] <%Ipsenscastle> Playing a single Metroid game spoils every Metroid game
[0:09:40] <%Laecerelius> So are those EMMI counter prompts really hard to get or is my old man brain just that bad?
[0:09:41] <tanarath> He should play it NOW
[0:09:44] <stantheman_97> THAT EXACT LOOK
[0:09:44] <+trashmanasam> @PatStaresAt you mean like how you spoiled a unch of people yesterday?
[0:09:44] <rytisone> Woolie is waiting for a remake
[0:09:46] <%bahookery> hey leave woolie and his fighting games alone
[0:09:46] <peachy996> Woolie will play it 5 years from no
[0:09:46] <marvel877> and then he'll end the podcast right there, Pat.
[0:09:47] <+CheesesSliced> You do realise that you've opened up a whole can of patpun worms, yeah?
[0:09:48] <dd44dostivei> keep playing more metroids
[0:09:50] <anAngryHamster> Woolie would say jumping on the goomba in the first screen of Super Mario was a spoiler
[0:10:06] <%Monkeyweed21> HE WAS
[0:10:07] <cpt_langosta> "Metroid Spoilers" is legit a meaningless phrase
[0:10:15] <+Kiefer_Suthrland> spoiler you get upgrades that let you go new places
[0:10:15] <JetpackMcQuack> that's metroid
[0:10:17] <Treasure_Vault> We already know it's probably gonna end with a timed escape like always
[0:10:20] <TheQuadrupleS> yep
[0:10:20] <%valriot> LUL Its super obvious
[0:10:23] <%dekkitout> I saw what I thought was the final boss and thought "Neat."

[0:10:38] <%notsoy> THE ARM IS HIS WIFE
[0:10:39] <marvel877> still waiting on my copy in the mail.

[0:10:40] <oda_flobunaga> Spoilers: Samus is a woman
[0:10:45] <%sniffy77> Pat what are you drinking
[0:10:45] <%valriot> "Pat, i cant believe you told me Vergil was the final boss of DMC3"

[0:14:08] <dawarw0lf> I hate my beard because milk gets stuck in it and it sucks
[0:14:08] <%TheHateFish> Real talk, though, beards are great for crumb catching
[0:14:09] <stantheman_97> so the delicious leftovers get crusty and moldy
[0:14:15] <%TheHateFish> Just awful cleaning 'em
[0:14:18] <cpt_langosta> "gotta shave my soup catcher" sounds way off and i don't like it
[0:14:18] <%AmericanSkidd> what are any of us doing?
[0:14:22] <%smoothwood07> You’re still a bigger man than my dad who literally threw a fit cause he’d have to miss the BIG GAME today

[0:18:51] <+Soliloquy123> You get a jpeg of the bag
[0:18:57] <%valriot> 9000 dollars to carry tampons and reciepts, women are wild
[0:18:57] <%AncelDeLambert> this is how gold futures work, btw
[0:19:02] <%PocketBearIllustrator> why would you even buy so much for a handbag anyway? bragging rights? materialism
[0:19:03] <+CheesesSliced> It's pronounced Louis Weeton
[0:19:05] <%solracc25> Just a jpeg
[0:19:06] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> you get a literal JPEG
[0:19:09] <cpt_langosta> also, the bag can be 3d printed by everyone via copy-paste at any time
[0:19:09] <+nivlac_555> lol
[0:19:11] <%CapnBeefs> $9000!!!!!! Is that bag made outta pure fucking diamonds!!!!
[0:19:16] <@commanderclaw> You also have to burn coal to say you own it

[0:20:06] <marvel877> WOMEN BE SHOPPIN
[0:20:08] <%MidnightBurst12> maybe the old guys like the bags
[0:20:08] <%dekkitout> That's fine- those bags are tangible goods
[0:20:10] <dawarw0lf> What’s worse? NFT or NTR?
[0:20:12] <@TheYellowcouch> Old bag new women
[0:20:16] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> oh like men paying stupid amounts for shoes is dumb
[0:20:16] <SummonerMagno> so like art
[0:20:16] <%X2Eliah> How many women want to buy a 40 year old bag??
[0:20:18] <%CalderGaming> a handbag has nonzero utility
[0:20:18] <%jtdobyns> NIke is also a scam
[0:20:19] <Treasure_Vault> Yet my extensive fanny pack collection is WORTHLESS
[0:20:20] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> isn't*
[0:20:21] <%thebeargoesHONK> thebeargoesHONK subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! Hello Pat, i've been meaning to ask.   Between Javik, Ashley, and shirtless edgelord Jack; which one is the worst?

[0:20:34] <M0untain_wolf> @dawarw0lf Yes.
[0:20:35] <%AmericanSkidd> you can hold it and use it
[0:20:36] <@TheYellowcouch> depends on what's in it
[0:20:36] <olm46> How many men would want to buy a 40 year old car?
[0:20:36] <Sunstalker> NTr has done less material harm to the planet then nft's
[0:20:37] <scrumbotime> @dawarw0lf Honestly, I'd say NFT, at least NTR isn't BURNING THE AMAZON
[0:20:40] <%RealThiele> is the bag rich?
[0:20:40] <%dekkitout> Same with sneakers
[0:20:41] <%LeiaSkynoober> My mother loves purses and pens, I can see that

[0:20:57] <+PatchTheSquid> @PatStaresAt same as old cars
[0:20:57] <%solracc25> Sneakers are for men that Handbags are for women
[0:20:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt think CIndy the Skull but rich and thats the customer
[0:20:58] <robosqueeb> id do it if I were rich so the women's can't have em
[0:20:58] <%AmericanSkidd> same deal
[0:20:59] <%CalderGaming> BEANIE BABIES
[0:21:01] <+RoByte2> And Jordans

[0:21:06] <%PocketBearIllustrator> canvas bags are cool AF, tho.
[0:21:07] <marvel877> and retro video games
[0:21:07] <%KetsuoTaberu> so basically almost no one then
[0:21:08] <@commanderclaw> Those are dumb too tho
[0:21:09] <BallerSwagBro9k> handbags are useless tho. Backpacks carry way more
[0:21:09] <%GhoulishCripple> my Mom is 100% the type to buy a 40 year old antique bag
[0:21:10] <%valriot> Pokemon is the reason Gacha exist, becuase of Japans Gambling problem
[0:21:10] <%Faustgesicht> And classic cars
[0:21:10] <Treasure_Vault> What if you could walk around with your baseball card on your forehead? La de da
[0:21:10] <+CheesesSliced> I have a bag...
[0:21:11] <%jillyrancher> I am here!
[0:21:12] <%sandrews> what about having a bag holding a bunch of smaller bags within itself
[0:21:14] <%X2Eliah> eeeeeew
[0:21:15] <cpt_langosta> all rare things with no function should get melted for fun
[0:21:15] <olaksi> cards and actiofigures are dumb too though
[0:21:15] <%jtdobyns> old 55 chevies go for a lot
[0:21:16] <Treasure_Vault> Sneakers, ok
[0:21:20] <%Ipsenscastle> fuck all these things
[0:21:21] <%X2Eliah> Sneakers have other ppl's foot juice tho
[0:21:22] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> sneaker heads are insane
[0:21:22] <chimeraxmachina> Yes, handbags do increase in value but only certain editions and only if you have the money to store them in a fully climate controlled vault. Fashion can be an investment but it’s tricky to conserve
[0:21:23] <%AmericanSkidd> the what are those?
[0:21:23] <%Crookedspiral> older stuff is better made too
[0:21:25] <Treasure_Vault> HAHA
[0:21:26] <%jillyrancher> I'll be passively listening though for most of this
[0:21:26] <+vaderxyz1970> My mother bought a Louise Vitton luggage Bag cuz of Crazy Rich Asians movie
[0:21:29] <Sunstalker> A big thing with the NFt shit is also people selling it to themselves ona fake account to boost the price and then scam a dumb idiot to buy it at that price from them.
[0:21:32] <NitronStreams> I am so fucking happy I never got into collecting bullshit
[0:21:33] <%jillyrancher> work shit suckw
[0:21:33] <%dekkitout> You don't even need to wear the shoes to covet them

[0:21:38] <olaksi> don't respect them
[0:21:40] <%MidnightBurst12> that's why you put the sneakers in a glass case
[0:21:40] <%Ipsenscastle> why respect them? LUL
[0:21:41] <ShudMirelurk> BRO >:(
[0:21:41] <pmtriox> why even respect them?

[0:22:02] <%RealThiele> Poggers appreciation
[0:22:04] <%Aleate> My coworker collects shoes. I asked him why is that better than a girl collecting shoes, and he says "Because he can wear them". Then I ask him if he does and he says "What are you insane those are expensive" tfuLost
[0:22:06] <marvel877> I legit am hunting after old travel cases for older game consoles like the rental cases Blockbuster had for renting the N64.
[0:22:06] <%ape_hawk> USDeez nuts

[0:22:11] <+vaderxyz1970> But do handbags have a very bad scalper problem
[0:22:13] <olm46> If YOU pissed on it it's a price boost

[0:22:18] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I was a mad collector for Smash amiibo myself

[0:22:48] <SilverFaustX> bag nerds
[0:22:53] <%afronooch> handbags and other high fashion items have the scalper problem built in

[0:23:02] <%Profmcstevie> Hobos don't have GUCCI
[0:23:03] <scrumbotime> Pat, the cops would, because that's fraud.
[0:23:07] <%X2Eliah> GATEKEEPERS

[0:23:14] <%RealThiele> 2FA the purse
[0:23:15] <Sunstalker> That is a dumb thing to dedicate a life to
[0:23:17] <olm46> Imagine dedicating your life to that
[0:23:18] <%TheHateFish> @Profmcstevie Maybe in your town
[0:23:18] <Blank9> I have dedicated my life to authenticating bags

[0:23:40] <marvel877> Chanel Authenticator sounds awesome.
[0:23:41] <+PatchTheSquid> PSA 9.5 Chanel bag huh?
[0:23:41] <%AkronymCLT> The reason you sell it on the street is so that you filter out the people who know better
[0:23:47] <@TheYellowcouch> You gotta mamoru the bag
[0:23:47] <%Profmcstevie> Their value is entirely "rare though"
[0:23:49] <Treasure_Vault> The Magic Reserved List is bullshit
[0:23:52] <%ScrapKingKeita> One of my favorite artists got into NFTs and it suuuuuuuuuucks

[0:23:58] <robosqueeb> WOMEN BEGONE

[0:42:39] <%RayReborne> GIVES YOU LUPIS OH NO
[0:42:39] <%castlerock42> I'd take death at this point.

Hey Pat, if these ME3 streams prove anything is that the Universe really cares for you.

[0:42:44] <SilverFaustX> DEATH

[0:42:47] <+Kurt_0> Huh
[0:42:47] <%sandrews> BONE
[0:42:48] <d3ltuhhh> RECTAL WHAT
[0:42:50] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt What, no death?
[0:42:53] <%CapnBeefs> How was this FDA approved?!
[0:42:54] <tanarath> HMMMMMMMMMM
[0:42:55] <%Taisuru> Sounds like you'd be better off taking straight up poison
[0:42:56] <%jaco_checkbox> is the depression a chemical thing or just reacting to your body melting
[0:42:56] <%Ipsenscastle> It also dried out my eyes to the point that I can't wear contact lenses anymore
[0:42:57] <+Kurt_0> Weak bone
[0:42:59] <%RealThiele> in your casket
[0:42:59] <Jetsfantasy> You've also got to get blood tests while taking it to make sure you're organs aren't failing
[0:43:00] <Sartastic> poor kids
[0:43:02] <olm46> Bleeding from every orifice, but my skin's so nice!
[0:43:02] <%dekkitout> I'd rather do cocaine than take that
[0:43:04] <Necnill> And now I'm having an anxitey attack. xD
[0:43:06] <robosqueeb> it literally sucks the moisture from your body
[0:43:06] <Treasure_Vault> acne relief seems to be a minor side effect
[0:43:11] <%MidnightBurst12> hormones?
[0:43:11] <%AncelDeLambert> like, yeah, that's an INSANE thing to target
[0:43:14] <%castlerock42> My guess is that it's seeping elsewhere.
[0:43:18] <robosqueeb> dries up all your pores to prevent acne
[0:43:18] <%RealThiele> you need oil in your joints
[0:43:20] <tanarath> So, basically, Pat got ultra-poisoned?
[0:43:20] <M0untain_wolf> You need to screet that oil
[0:43:22] <%RayReborne> yeah the skin oil is SUPER important lol
[0:43:25] <SilverFaustX> rip ppl that tested this
[0:43:26] <+MightyDuckShoes> the body NEEDS oil
[0:43:27] <LVL1_Scumbag> The acne seems preferable at that point
[0:43:27] <olaksi> a lot of the body needs oil apparently
[0:43:29] <%Ipsenscastle> yep
[0:43:31] <Jolly_Adventurer> YEP
[0:43:32] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Hormone manipulation most likely @patstaresat
[0:43:32] <olm46> Well that's perfect
[0:43:34] <%AncelDeLambert> seeing as your entire body is made of fat as much as any other molecule, that's nuts
[0:43:34] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt I know all of that happens when you have to deal with Kai Leng, but what happens with Accutaine?

[0:44:50] <olaksi> if you poke it, pat is returned to factory settings
[0:44:51] <$MrWurmles> It's probably something like, Because it stops certain automated processes in the body, for someone who is pregnant, the fetus is not cared for internally correctly because certain automated functions are suspended, which hinders it's growth process leading to birth defects.

[0:46:59] <PaperyHornet1013> Pat during combat in citadel your squad has a lot of chatter so rushing through combat might be detrimental

[0:47:08] <dawarw0lf> It’s best of the dlcs and you can’t say otherwise

[0:47:30] <razieltano123> @PatStaresAt You have one more Main Mission before you can do the Citadel DLC at it's best.
[0:47:31] <%AmericanSkidd> wow

[0:48:03] <%X2Eliah> Pat does have sanctuary left
[0:48:05] <dawarw0lf> @razieltano123 It actually doesn’t matter until after the first part of the dlc but it’s still for the nest

[0:48:13] <%Cozy90> @RayReborne gotta keep em guessing. can't do it too often
[0:48:16] <$lotharrio> I listened to Pink Floyd while I got my wisdom teeth removed. It was great.
[0:48:20] <olaksi> mind over matter, or drugs
[0:48:20] <+Arnschen> Oh yeah, I remember when they had to smash my teeth cause they were too deep in and I felt it.

[0:48:29] <%castlerock42> Yeah, that shit is a mixed blessing at best.
[0:48:30] <%jtdobyns> The citadel DLC should be completed after Horizon to get the most out of It. You can't have everyone from your squad involved in the Citadel dlc until after you've completed the mission on Sanctuary with Miranda
[0:48:30] <%Garthunox> it freaked me out so much, i was losing my mind
[0:48:35] <%RayReborne> @cozy90 uh huh, sure Kappa

[1:06:43] <%RayReborne> Baby mode for Baby Kai Leng
[1:06:47] <dawarw0lf> I wish you change it on the fight that comes later (spoilers) just so you can hear alll the dialogue
[1:06:50] <%castlerock42> Pat, weren't you on the right side of the screen for ME3?
[1:06:50] <ShoMibu> Pat mode is best mode.
[1:06:53] <toyforus235> the mode that Kai Leng wants
[1:06:53] <%trackles_64> nothing good
[1:06:54] <%Ipsenscastle> I am become baby, destroyer of worlds

[1:06:55] <OldManDeckardCain> damn, pat is too scared to face kai leng outside of baby mode Kappa
[1:06:58] <hereiam407> This news station sucks

[1:07:26] <cpt_langosta> pat, get ready for a lot of things to make no sense
[1:07:26] <%AmericanSkidd> its a mystery
[1:07:27] <godila2> chat dont say it
[1:07:29] <%miguelrod777> understood
[1:07:32] <%trackles_64> Refugee slaughter
[1:07:32] <peachy996> Well Sanctuary takes all Aliens
[1:07:40] <%Theycallmenerf> Behave Chat
[1:07:42] <%afronooch> chat cant help but spoil lol
[1:07:47] <BurdRightsActivist> Kai Slaughtered them, Like Animals.
[1:07:47] <%dekkitout> No good could come from "sorted out the refugees"
[1:07:48] <$lotharrio> They were being flavored with bacon, for that Reap-tastic crunch.
[1:07:52] <hereiam407> "Sanctuary"
[1:07:53] <ShoMibu> Big screen for early 2000's/
[1:07:55] <BurdRightsActivist> The women and the children too
[1:08:00] <PaperyHornet1013> weapon in this area
[1:08:02] <peachy996> I hate this game. I cannot help myself
[1:08:07] <oda_flobunaga> Sanctuary, more like Stankuary
[1:08:16] <vidgmes> welcome to our "refugees laughter" facility
[1:08:17] <ARDM112> It's almost like Cerberus was originally written as openly working for Reapers, only to be changed into sorta-kinda-actually-not working for Reapers during rewrites that weren't thorough enough
[1:08:17] <L3m0nTwi5t> Pat playing games on "journalist" mode probably best for everyone.
[1:08:18] <dawarw0lf> I wish more missions had combinations of factions
[1:08:19] <%lumporr> this is Canon Shepard
[1:08:22] <hereiam407> I think we could get an AI to play this game, and Pat could just stare at it
[1:08:29] <%AmericanSkidd> yes
[1:08:29] <%Theycallmenerf> Seems like ME3 early to mid game is fun as we near the end it’s just doodoo
[1:08:31] <%cvp5127> my sanctuary
[1:08:31] <cpt_langosta> sounds like garrus just shouted "poor cerberus"
[1:08:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> holy shit i didn't realize baby mode was BIG baby mode. but that's good keep it up pat
[1:08:45] <%Aleate> POOL TIME tfuHypers
[1:08:48] <%trackles_64> why noot just watch a youtube lets play and react to it?
[1:08:50] <%coward_man> but did you know "hold RT to charge" though?
[1:08:53] <Jetsfantasy> "I'd recognize that ass anywhere"
[1:08:53] <%SuckerPunchSyd> HELL YEAH
[1:08:57] <%faintsmile> @hereiam407 let chat play LUL

[1:09:10] <%AmericanSkidd> shocker
[1:09:12] <BurdRightsActivist> Surprised the camera feed didn't just show her ass
[1:09:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @trackles_64 you can't dialogue?
[1:09:21] <dawarw0lf> Wow. What a twist
[1:09:22] <+DatAsuna> her dad's a jerk and her twin sister looks nothing like her
[1:09:22] <%coward_man> Woolie would agree with Miranda's dad
[1:09:24] <%trackles_64> Hlemet go blink
[1:09:28] <SaltyAzteca> Pools closed
[1:09:29] <peachy996> I miss the Special Eyes
[1:09:29] <%lumporr> "Cerberus, Reapers, and WORST of all..."
[1:09:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pool's closed
[1:09:35] <ShoMibu> Thats one heak of a family reuinion.
[1:09:37] <rytisone> a dead pool
[1:09:40] <%trackles_64> HACKERMANS
[1:09:40] <pmtriox> if comms are being blocked they should have just used the normandy to blast the tower to shit
[1:09:44] <hereiam407> @faintsmile Everyone gets 3 seconds to control the game
[1:09:46] <BurdRightsActivist> Poo's closed
[1:09:47] <cpt_langosta> lol sideways keyboard
[1:09:47] <%Mr_Pylon> vertical keyboard, how futuristic
[1:09:50] <dawarw0lf> @coward_man Cerberus does have some type of jet packs
[1:09:57] <%dekkitout> Cerberus makes weird pools
[1:09:59] <moonwraithdruckmann> is this game as bad as people are saying??????
[1:10:14] <%X2Eliah> @moonwraithdruckmann LUL of course not
[1:10:15] <UrsaDoom> I'm surprised that they didn't make you fight a bunch of evil Miranda clones.
[1:10:15] <%afronooch> wait yeah, why did he make one thicc clone and one regular clone
[1:10:15] <hereiam407> @moonwraithdruckmann Its all over the place
[1:10:17] <%hewlettfan96> How’s pat feeling today??
[1:10:17] <pmtriox> ITS THE SAME TECHNOLOGY TALI
[1:10:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @moonwraithdruckmann eh, there's bad parts, but the main gameplay is pretty fun
[1:10:23] <%alphonseisbest> @moonwraithdruckmann NO, but is still not that great
[1:10:24] <%lumporr> reapers got pumps
[1:10:25] <%X2Eliah> Yeah this makes no sense
[1:10:27] <%Mr_Pylon> oh no, a Reaper pool!
[1:10:29] <%Maids4lyfe> a reaper pump
[1:10:29] <cpt_langosta> reaper pumps, mate. they're evil.
[1:10:30] <ShoMibu> Water is just a optical illusion of a substance that is liquified earth nector.
[1:10:30] <%faintsmile> @hereiam407 LOL we would never make it past the opening
[1:10:30] <+das_sensentier> A REAPER PUMP
[1:10:33] <some_brave_apollo> mass effect 3 is just bad
[1:10:34] <Kivros> it's an evil pump
[1:10:34] <%MidnightBurst12> a REAPER pump
[1:10:35] <vidgmes> reapers probably have pumps too
[1:10:36] <%HairballCT> pumps, but like, REAPER pumps
[1:10:37] <hereiam407> Heat the water
[1:10:38] <Goraka91> Hydroponics! I knew it!
[1:10:39] <$lotharrio> Reapers' evil technology... water purifiers!
[1:10:39] <%trackles_64> Rememeber ME2?
[1:10:39] <%Profmcstevie> Reaper waterpark, ooooh~
[1:10:40] <%akscully> a REAPER water pump
[1:10:40] <BurdRightsActivist> REAPER SWIMMING POOL monkaS
[1:10:40] <%X2Eliah> Pat, the reason is "Ran out of time"
[1:10:41] <%coward_man> the reapers invented pools
[1:10:41] <stormhawk9891> Naw man it's a Reaper pump
[1:10:41] <SaltyAzteca> The tubing from the second one maybe?
[1:10:41] <%dekkitout> Maybe the leviathans/reapers invented water pumps
[1:10:42] <@TheYellowcouch> it's an EVIL pump
[1:10:42] <hereiam407> With your gun
[1:10:43] <%SuckerPunchSyd> The reapers made that pump

[1:11:16] <peachy996> It's the first or last room in Dead Space 2
[1:11:19] <pmtriox> that was the entire basis of why the Reaper twist in ME1 was so amazing because they caused us to recreate our tech using their schematics in the first place
[1:11:20] <%Theycallmenerf> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[1:11:21] <SaltyAzteca> zyep I was right

[1:16:36] <zanzibarian_hamster> Literal adrenochrome harvesting aliens, Alex Jones was RIGHT!
[1:16:39] <dawarw0lf> @shomibu That doesn’t make any since
[1:16:43] <+DatAsuna> That's a book reference yeah, mind control drugs, MKULTRA stuff
[1:16:43] <hereiam407> @ShoMibu It was an asari
[1:16:45] <SaltyAzteca> THE GREATER GOOD
[1:16:58] <%X2Eliah> Don't you just love being categorized as "genetic waste"?
[1:16:59] <ExpressNode> Genetic ooze
[1:17:02] <jorniev> WHY not let tali do that sheppard
[1:17:12] <some_brave_apollo> where did they find all these ardat yakshis to make into reaper monsters anyway? I thought there was only a small number of them in quarantine as of ME2
[1:17:14] <+DatAsuna> What made you think that shepard?
[1:17:16] <ShoMibu> dawarw0lf Yeah guess so LUL
[1:17:22] <ShoMibu> Oh i see an asari.
[1:17:30] <knight_verse> millions of refugees.
[1:17:44] <tanarath> Nazi science
[1:17:50] <ShoMibu> Who would of thought the illusive man would be so illusive.
[1:17:51] <%AmericanSkidd> they can USE IT
[1:17:54] <%Theycallmenerf> War crimes
[1:17:57] <scrumbotime> they can make Racism infectious
[1:17:59] <ARDM112> No Pat, it's much more ambitious than that LUL
[1:17:59] <%X2Eliah> @some_brave_apollo Its not really clear if Banshees need to be A-Y or if any asari can become a banshee
[1:17:59] <SaltyAzteca> Sleeper agents en masse
[1:18:00] <%lumporr> cerbygang
[1:18:00] <jorniev> DAMN
[1:18:03] <PaperyHornet1013> NOW YOUR THINKING WITH PORTALS
[1:18:08] <BurdRightsActivist> CERBYGANGCERBYGANG
[1:18:09] <Mattais88> @some_brave_apollo IIRC they take the resseive genes that most Asari have and just force it.
[1:18:10] <%dekkitout> psaCrazyhand ... sure
[1:18:10] <oda_flobunaga> like they already did?
[1:18:11] <quipquest1> Pat, are you saying these plot points are mixed up?
[1:18:12] <%GarbageNirvana> @ShoMibu and a man
[1:18:13] <Sp3ctre48> @some_brave_apollo Banshees can be made from any Asari that can possibly be Ardat Yakshi
[1:18:15] <jorniev> PAT just piecing it together really fast
[1:18:18] <hereiam407> Rush rush rush
[1:18:27] <%Theycallmenerf> Look it’s almost like the writing is just shit.
[1:18:30] <commanderapathy> all for the good of humanity
[1:18:35] <hereiam407> Is he ok?
[1:18:37] <cpt_langosta> why say "check your fire" in a game with no friendly fire option?
[1:18:42] <hereiam407> He'll recover
[1:18:45] <ShoMibu> Dick move.
[1:18:48] <jorniev> BUT WAIT THEY ALREADY ATTACKED THE CITADEL WITH REGULAR GUYS
[1:18:53] <%dekkitout> What, these are lowercase 'h' husks?
[1:18:53] <+DatAsuna> Also the existence of the leviathans are the only thing that could possibly justify fucking with indoctrination
[1:18:56] <%alphonseisbest> bark bark
[1:18:58] <%GarbageNirvana> oh no Miranda's dad is Kano
[1:18:59] <%X2Eliah> @cpt_langosta because military dialogue hooo rah
[1:19:03] <%AncelDeLambert> CROIKEY DINGO

[1:19:05] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Zangief angy
[1:19:06] <rytisone> the cost of cutting edge tech
[1:19:09] <%AncelDeLambert> TOO ROIGHT WATCHA
[1:19:11] <+MightyDuckShoes> So is Illusive Man unwittingly just making humanity the new collectors?
[1:19:17] <hereiam407> @jorniev Didn't they remove someones mask during Mordin's mission, and he was husky?
[1:19:19] <+DatAsuna> no shit miranda
[1:19:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @jorniev those weren't "normal" guys

[1:20:38] <hereiam407> Super Reaper control
[1:20:39] <%AmericanSkidd> like really big
[1:20:42] <%ape_hawk> or the reapers are letting them think they have control over them
[1:20:50] <Tabula4444> Purely for the betterment of mankind, worth the risk, etc
[1:20:52] <dawarw0lf> They tried to set it up at least
[1:20:53] <scrumbotime> But.... the reapers themselves aren't running ON the signal, they're MAKING the signal, you couldn't control a radio by putting another radio near it
[1:20:55] <Goraka91> Alien machine mind made from an entire race: lmao

[1:21:58] <%lumporr> oh man i just beat 2077 for the tim rogers review, that game is still a fucking MESS
[1:21:58] <Tabula4444> "I can't beat him, he's too cool and original"
[1:22:00] <%X2Eliah> Like it feels like such a failed game
[1:22:00] <+DatAsuna> Also bug fixes don't replace all the missing mechanics
[1:22:01] <pmtriox> 1070 ran finnd
[1:22:03] <commanderapathy> no
[1:22:06] <hereiam407> Deathloop has been crashing and running like crap on my 3060ti with raytracing
[1:22:09] <+tomdwarf> I had a 3080. It actually ran pretty well, but I just may be lucky with my rig.

[1:22:49] <rytisone> spending the whole day watching the review LUL
[1:22:53] <some_brave_apollo> i feel like humans are far too small in number for cerberus to use them as expendable test subjects so often tbh
[1:22:53] <%trackles_64> F
[1:22:55] <Treasure_Vault> There's a chance it's not coming out, cause of the fucky wucky computerino softwaroni business
[1:23:00] <+das_sensentier> wat

[1:23:12] <%Ipsenscastle> ????
[1:23:13] <%trackles_64> Game design
[1:23:13] <%lilytastic> i'm excited for it to be the same two hour video, looped five times with minor changes
[1:23:18] <BurdRightsActivist> ???????????????????????????????????????????
[1:23:19] <Sigma_190_Beta> THAT LOOKED AMAZING! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABoUT?
[1:23:20] <UrsaDoom> Andromeda quality

[1:23:23] <hereiam407> Tali has Garrus all worked up
[1:23:23] <%CasualSleepyGamer> There's a way out that's why
[1:23:24] <pmtriox> it was supposed to be a refugee on the table
[1:23:24] <wolverinewaswrong> how is humanity not extinct by now?
[1:23:26] <%GarbageNirvana> Shepard! Have you played A Way Out!?
[1:23:26] <%ape_hawk> shepard, a way out!
[1:23:26] <stantheman_97> SHEPARD
[1:23:28] <+DatAsuna> "Shepard: brothers: a tale of two sons!"
[1:23:30] <TioXyco> did the pods also gitch into place like.... instantly?
[1:23:31] <%alphonseisbest> A WAY OUT
[1:23:34] <%faintsmile> just shoots it
[1:23:42] <crassletter> that was the most broken thing i have seen
[1:23:44] <BurdRightsActivist> SHEPARD
[1:23:45] <pmtriox> it was always exactly as shit as that
[1:23:46] <dawarw0lf> @some_brave_apollo There are a lot of humans in mass effect
[1:23:48] <crassletter> i am so confused
[1:23:52] <peachy996> Zombie Factory
[1:23:53] <hereiam407> No, we have enough VO, what do you mean?
[1:23:55] <Mattais88> Shapard It takes two
[1:23:56] <ShoMibu> When in doubt, shoot it huh.
[1:24:10] <%trackles_64> EA
[1:24:10] <godila2> pat dont miss weapon in this area its really good
[1:24:10] <hereiam407> Think about the plot
[1:24:11] <cpt_langosta> brute = brute
[1:24:14] <%AncelDeLambert> that's EA for you
[1:24:14] <%coward_man> when did Dead Space 3 come out?
[1:24:14] <%trackles_64> Bioware Magic
[1:24:15] <$lotharrio> Guess they liked it.
[1:24:15] <hereiam407> It's the same plot
[1:24:15] <knight_verse> there's a weapon here.
[1:24:16] <moonmintparadise> BOTH ARE EA
[1:24:17] <commanderapathy> dead space good
[1:24:18] <%AmericanSkidd> short production times
[1:24:19] <%JumboCrunchies> Who is Pat smoochin' on? I havent really been watching the series
[1:24:19] <+FattimusSlime> They're both EA games, might have redressed a set 90's TV style
[1:24:20] <peachy996> Dead Space 2 was good so lets rip that off
[1:24:20] <Goraka91> EA
[1:24:20] <%faintsmile> hell yeah baby mode
[1:24:21] <Tracazoid> The bigger franchise cannibalized the smaller one
[1:24:23] <%GarbageNirvana> Didn't this come out pretty close to Dead Space 3
[1:24:24] <jacobknight13> they are both made by EA
[1:24:24] <+DatAsuna> and then dead space had the N7 armour
[1:24:25] <%dekkitout> Why not
[1:24:25] <pmtriox> I WONDER PAT
[1:24:28] <Sp3ctre48> It's almost like the devs were both owned by the same company or something
[1:24:28] <Coystick> What you don't like Dead Space, fake Dead Space fan
[1:24:31] <dawarw0lf> Sci fi games pat
[1:24:32] <ShoMibu> dnoNLT Its like they are reusing assets!
[1:24:34] <%coward_man> cause they rushed this shit and probably took a lot of stuff from Dead Space 2?
[1:24:34] <SaltyAzteca> ...HEY BANSHEE'S ARE JUST DIVIDERS
[1:24:35] <+trashmanasam> @JumboCrunchies tali
[1:24:37] <T_Sasquatch> the mission in me1 is dead space before deadspace
[1:24:42] <Goraka91> Dead space good, make lots of dead space, ruin dead space, shut down studio
[1:24:48] <SaltyAzteca> AND BRUTES ARE JUST GOLIATHS
[1:24:49] <%terrible35> Whoa a door!\
[1:24:51] <UrsaDoom> makes me wish they put the Plasma Cutter in Mass Effect
[1:24:52] <%JumboCrunchies> Yucky
[1:24:52] <hereiam407> Its like they had a script for both games, and pointed at one, and said, make that scary
[1:24:56] <%AmericanSkidd> level cap baby
[1:24:58] <%Monkeyweed21> cuz husks were lame and the Reapers needed cool ground forces so they copied Dead Space's homework
[1:24:59] <some_brave_apollo> @dawarw0lf right but there's not more humans than non-humans, so its odd that the racist group are so cavalier about killing their "own guys"
[1:25:00] <pmtriox> jennifer hale pulling triple duty
[1:25:02] <+ryuguitarfreak> Wow. Is this on easy?
[1:25:02] <%lumporr> "I see a doorway! I see some stairs! I see an elevator!"
[1:25:03] <dawarw0lf> Is mass effect 3 the dead space of dark souls?
[1:25:05] <Mattais88> MAx Level
[1:25:06] <%X2Eliah> Enjoy the 3 points you will never be able to spend
[1:25:12] <%lumporr> shoot em both
[1:25:14] <+MightyDuckShoes> The stasised new character should have been Issac Clarke. Necromorphs = Less Glowy Reapers
[1:25:16] <godila2> can you buy that weapon or its lost?
[1:25:17] <Sigma_190_Beta> YEAH, MIRANDA JOBBING!
[1:25:17] <@Ranryu692> welp, get ready to be annoyed by your extra skill points for the rest of the game

[1:33:25] <ARDM112> Indocrinated people working for Reapers
[1:33:25] <%Prowtellen> Probably some hyper-indocrinated dude
[1:33:25] <tanarath> Uh?
[1:33:25] <%AmuserName> Indoced pawns
[1:33:25] <%miguelrod777> indoctrinationed?

[1:33:27] <+Them00n> The writers certainly didn't
[1:33:28] <TheAntiNihilist> ?
[1:33:29] <Vadrigar1994> Is EDI learning that empathy is a thing 95% of the way into the third game
[1:33:30] <BurdRightsActivist> ??????????????????????????????
[1:33:30] <Tabula4444> Reaper guards

[1:33:35] <some_brave_apollo> also i don't think that's how humans behave irl
[1:33:35] <quipquest1> Reapers are Nazis now?
[1:33:35] <%SveriSageAdvice> this feels like it was shoehorned in last second
[1:33:36] <Coystick> A NAZI DID IT

[1:33:44] <@Ranryu692> how many times has Shepard talked to Reapers through indoctrinated people?
[1:33:45] <+DatAsuna> There's a buncha governments sending people in like you read in the codex
[1:33:45] <$lotharrio> They make computer noises at modems.
[1:33:46] <mr_saturday93> NO SHUT UP

[1:34:12] <Dudeakoff> she's built different
[1:34:14] <+cermo55> Good Edi

[1:34:17] <T_Sasquatch> dont do that you dummy
[1:34:17] <%jillyrancher> Reapers can talk to people Pat lol

[1:34:30] <%UvBenServed> <3
[1:34:31] <+tomdwarf> But yeah, the reapers only care about killing everyone, and have perfect mind control. Why even HAVE prisons and interrogation. Just keep them near you for a month, they'll ALL talk.
[1:34:31] <lisadagz> <3 <3
[1:34:32] <Sunstalker> The robot tiddies aren't evil PogChamp
[1:34:34] <olaksi> like from a logical altruistic point risking for one person escaping is better than none, why is this something an advanced AI doesn't understand
[1:34:36] <%AmericanSkidd> thats hot
[1:34:37] <arussoltzm> Why do the reapers need camps, though morbid is a corpse not equivalent for what they use it for
[1:34:37] <%xcompleasedad> The best EDI moment
[1:34:37] <wolverinewaswrong> thanks ill feel less bad

[1:34:39] <%alphonseisbest> IT IS

[1:37:48] <dawarw0lf> TAIL is so bi
[1:37:51] <wolverinewaswrong> was?
[1:37:56] <some_brave_apollo> why is she talking like Miranda is dead
[1:37:58] <+DatAsuna> damn right she was a bitch
[1:37:58] <wolverinewaswrong> the game is assuming she's dead?
[1:37:59] <+MightyDuckShoes> is Miranda dead?
[1:37:59] <Darren716> Did Pat do the DLCs?
[1:37:59] <dd44dostivei> this makes more sense if miranda died in the last mission
[1:38:00] <@Ranryu692> @zanzibarian_hamster no, they did it off-screen because he could have died in ME2
[1:38:01] <+das_sensentier> SHE IS SO DEAD
[1:38:01] <seniormeatbox> EMERGENCY INDUCTION PORT
[1:38:01] <%AmuserName> For context, Miranda COULD die back there.
[1:38:02] <%CalderGaming> YEAH ABOUT THAT
[1:38:03] <%X2Eliah> GUESS WHY
[1:38:03] <SaltyAzteca> WHO CARES
[1:38:04] <$Futurecity10> Because she does this if miranda dies
[1:38:04] <Sp3ctre48> Don't worry about it
[1:38:04] <%Mr_Pylon> This sounds like she thinks Miranda is dead?
[1:38:05] <Necnill> Drinking through a helmet
[1:38:05] <Goraka91> She COULD be dead
[1:38:06] <%andrewofbob> mIRANDA could BE DEAD
[1:38:06] <%ahomeschooldropout> Cause Miranda could die in that mission
[1:38:06] <%maenos2> daddy issues
[1:38:07] <hereiam407> Miranda is just not here, so
[1:38:07] <quipquest1> Cause she might have been
[1:38:07] <@Ranryu692> Daddy issues
[1:38:08] <%machshop> miranda died in my game and this is exactly what tali said lmao
[1:38:08] <%faintsmile> shes going thru her daddy issues pat
[1:38:08] <+DatAsuna> because they only wrote one version of this
[1:38:08] <%miguelrod777> she can die
[1:38:09] <cpt_langosta> miranda could've died in that mission
[1:38:09] <%X2Eliah> GUESS WHY PAT
[1:38:09] <Coystick> Gimmie that smashed immaculate frog ass
[1:38:09] <%strakillias> Cause Miranda can die on Horizon
[1:38:09] <%ScrapKingKeita> This is used as both a death conversation
[1:38:10] <%Xevtes> did it bug out
[1:38:10] <dawarw0lf> Because Miranda can die
[1:38:11] <TioXyco> she did what she had to do, she died
[1:38:11] <%alphonseisbest> she's not
[1:38:11] <TheAntiNihilist> CUZ mIRANDA is DEAD
[1:38:12] <godila2> because she could
[1:38:12] <%Taisuru> RIP Miranda
[1:38:12] <$hattrick61> because she could have been
[1:38:12] <+cermo55> Because in some versions she is dead
[1:38:13] <ShoMibu> Because shes not part of the crew?
[1:38:13] <peachy996> Because Miranda can die to Kai Leng
[1:38:13] <$lotharrio> So they don't have to double up.
[1:38:14] <%AmericanSkidd> LUL
[1:38:14] <ARDM112> because this would play if she died with some minor differences
[1:38:17] <%Aleate> So they didn't have to change the dialogue if she did
[1:38:18] <%alphonseisbest> daddy issues PAT
[1:38:18] <+Them00n> This game is so unfinished
[1:38:19] <%Piemono> Poor Game Logic

[1:38:21] <wolverinewaswrong> quarians don't know you can survive small cuts
[1:38:22] <%alphonseisbest> HAH
[1:38:23] <ghosrevan> RIP Miranda
[1:38:24] <Jetsfantasy> They made vague dialogue to save money LUL
[1:38:25] <%GhoulishCripple> Miranda Could be dead you don't know. she coulda slipped on a rock
[1:38:27] <%cvp5127> LUL
[1:38:27] <+xp194> @PatStaresAt Multiple use dialogue lines!
[1:38:28] <@TheYellowcouch> We love a woman that can explode at any second and still takes risks
[1:38:29] <%alphonseisbest> nice injoke
[1:38:32] <Mattais88> Because if you didn't tell her about kai leng she's die
[1:38:32] <GrifGrif> he sounds like a vorcha cause he also voices the vorcha
[1:38:32] <Jane_Lo> there was no time, so it is a dialogue from death version LUL
[1:38:32] <dawarw0lf> Vorcha is payed by mark meer
[1:38:33] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Miranda can die, so this is something that can happen.
[1:38:33] <Zombrocom> Because they wrote this great scene for her death and they didn't want to waste it, is my guess
[1:38:34] <peachy996> If you don't warn her about Kai Leng earlier in the game, Miranda will die
[1:38:37] <%Dakuu75> daaaaaaaaamn....
[1:38:38] <Djinnazz> they gonna hate fuck now?
[1:38:40] <%Jeemukun> woooo daddy issues
[1:38:40] <%AmuserName> Miranda lived because you gave her the intel about Kai Leng tracking her or whatever.
[1:38:41] <BallerSwagBro9k> IT PLAYS IF SHE DIED TOO
[1:38:41] <%andrewofbob> I ask that all the time, Tali
[1:38:41] <%Monkeyweed21> relatable
[1:38:43] <%machshop> SeemsGood
[1:38:43] <Goraka91> If you don't warn her about super badass Kai Leng she dies
[1:38:45] <%KnifeyMcEdge> HELL YA
[1:38:48] <MrATheGreat> Miranda can super die if she wasn’t loyal or you didn’t do the conversation prompts
[1:38:49] <%CalderGaming> "Drink more" - Shepard
[1:38:51] <hereiam407> Note to crew, Turian Ale will no longer be served in the lounge
[1:38:52] <%Xevtes> @wolverinewaswrong well thats true for them  isnt it
[1:38:53] <TheAntiNihilist> THE PORT
[1:38:56] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt So if you dont do all the citadel interactions withy Miranda during the game parts, she totally dies

[1:45:51] <%cvp5127> LUL
[1:45:51] <Sp3ctre48> He would've killed himself after the game
[1:45:52] <ShoMibu> Wait really?
[1:45:52] <+DatAsuna> Not on the spot
[1:45:52] <%Jeemukun> he woulda killed himself after the war
[1:45:52] <Sigma_190_Beta> Yeah, he kills himself.
[1:45:53] <%akscully> he commits suicide after the game
[1:45:53] <%maenos2> what?!
[1:45:53] <+tomdwarf> He would get very depressed after the mission was over.
[1:45:53] <dd44dostivei> javik plans suicide after the war

[1:45:59] <%sunsetdisc0> at the end of the game javik would have decided that once the reapers are gone hes gonna kill himself
[1:46:02] <+DatAsuna> He just says he'll commit suicide after the war
[1:46:04] <%maenos2> holy shit how did I never see this
[1:46:05] <%snugglepuggs> he would have been traumatized that he would kill himself after the war
[1:46:06] <SaltyAzteca> @Ranryu692 Let the dead bury their dead is what I know
[1:46:09] <dawarw0lf> He gets freaked out and depressed and kill himslef after the war
[1:46:10] <+DatAsuna> But nothing changes during the plot
[1:46:11] <$MrWurmles> He would choose to commit suicide after the war was won. Because he doesn't need to be alive anymore to fight it.
[1:46:15] <Coystick> He contracts ligma
[1:46:17] <IsntItSad> Javik talks about how his crew got indoctrinated, then he had to constantly fight them and put them all down. In the epilogue, he goes off to kill himself.
[1:46:19] <peachy996> He's gonna try and Old Snake it
[1:46:19] <cpt_langosta> EH, STEVE
[1:46:19] <%KetsuoTaberu> ey

[1:46:21] <Meltoras12> EH STEVE

[1:46:21] <Goraka91> To be fair, your entire race being dead is a pretty valid reason for thoughts like that, oof

[1:48:10] <Necnill> @ShogunNoonto They did but there's still one in the chamber
[1:48:11] <ShoMibu> Wait the ending is DLC?

[1:48:15] <moonmeh> lets gooo
[1:48:15] <%RealThiele> piss on the citadel noone will care
[1:48:18] <@Ranryu692> Just as a warning to everyone in chat: don't make us put this into Emotes-Only Mode
[1:48:18] <ShoMibu> Oh wait yeah it is LUL
[1:48:26] <ShoMibu> tanarath Ah i see thanks.
[1:48:26] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite piss on the Citadel
[1:48:27] <%faintsmile> do you have to meet miranda before starting the DLC or does she show up regardless??
[1:48:33] <oda_flobunaga> Someone needs to make a ME3 mod that replaces all the enemies with Kai Leng
[1:48:33] <ctk96> This will be a long one LUL LUL
[1:48:35] <%X2Eliah> @Ranryu692 Eeeh just do it the moment Pat gets bacl
[1:48:48] <%Aleate> @Ranryu692 I'll be good because the last time I played this was on release zubSMILE
[1:48:49] <dawarw0lf> Don’t tell him to restart to get other dialogue
[1:48:52] <ShoMibu> I haven't had a dog in a long time so i forget that they still get humping from time to time.
[1:48:59] <Sp3ctre48> I don't think Miranda shows up at the party until after Horizon the way people were talking
[1:49:00] <+taggerung403> does you prefer doing citadel just before the finale or as a post-game epilogue hurrah
[1:49:06] <okuba3> popuriCheering popuriCheering
[1:49:27] <+xp194> I prefer it being the headcannon ending personally.
[1:49:28] <%X2Eliah> @taggerung403 There is no postgame
[1:49:37] <%RealThiele> pat needs some of them animated emotes
[1:49:39] <+crustypunky> maxyyBobble
[1:49:45] <Sp3ctre48> I always do Citadel right after Horizon
[1:49:52] <%X2Eliah> Also putting it postgame makes 0 sense considering what happens to the citadel
[1:50:00] <Dio_TR> Mass Effecr starts at the Citadel
[1:50:04] <dawarw0lf> As much as I want to talk maybe emote only would be for the best? At least for the first half. After it he might need some guidence

[1:50:48] <+DatAsuna> @Sp3ctre48 Personally I way prefer it to be the end of my playthrough
[1:51:00] <+DatAsuna> End of citadel is much nicer to leave on than the actual ending. lol
[1:51:04] <dawarw0lf> I’m a fan of the bittersweet ending myself
[1:51:06] <Saffry_Ruzin> I hate how similar Vega looks to Carver from Dead Space 3
[1:51:06] <%MalekDracarus> Greetings from Vod land! I haven’t been able to catch a single stream live for 3 months until this one. Thank you for making my weeks bearable and keep up the good work.

[1:51:24] <Sp3ctre48> @Sp3ctre48 I see that, I just usually have no motivation to play the game again after the last mission
[1:51:25] <cpt_langosta> They really should've made a Microsoft Bob DLC for this game. What a wasted opportunity...
[1:51:27] <%jtdobyns> I can not wait.....
[1:51:30] <%Dakuu75> "emergency induction port"- I'm still laughing over that lol

[2:06:32] <$MrWurmles> Thinking of it, Is this message implying that the Prototype Normandy was the first and ONLY ship that Anderson commandered as a Captain before being promoted? I know he got promoted because they wanted him off the ship for Shepard in ME1 but wow, that's a fast promotion.

[2:12:45] <%miguelrod777> we paid for keth David we damn are gonna use him
[2:12:59] <+xp194> Soldiers written by people who've never been near the military.
[2:12:59] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean EA had the money for sure
[2:12:59] <M0untain_wolf> War is Hell of a good time when you're dropping a few tons of explosives on a ten mile grind
[2:13:03] <Sp3ctre48> It's not padding, all this shit is optional
[2:13:10] <+taggerung403> the spectre interview is cool
[2:13:12] <%DrTomT18> Remeber when he was in Saints Row 4?
[2:13:12] <Meltoras12> The whole Dlc is actually listening to Anderson's diary.
[2:13:17] <%AmericanSkidd> This is Mass Effect
[2:13:18] <Coystick> Always grabbing ass, but not this time
[2:13:19] <+DatAsuna> Reminder that hudson did a twitter poll about if fans wanted a contact war game or an explore new galaxy game then canned an in development contact war prequel for andromeda. lol
[2:13:21] <%ape_hawk> off to fight the birdpeople
[2:13:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> aaaaaaliens
[2:13:26] <%lumporr> "Terrible men. Hated all of them."
[2:13:29] <hereiam407> This music works well for the tone
[2:13:29] <cpt_langosta> and the aliens turned out to be SUPER HOT
[2:13:30] <TourettesPlays> I like how the Turians call it the "Relay 314 Incident". Kind of like how butthurt southerners call the American Civil War the "War of Northern Aggression"
[2:13:31] <%trackles_64> Turian warfare
[2:13:32] <%castlerock42> The First Contact War makes it sound like it took forever for the Council to find out how badly the Turians jumped the gun.
[2:13:35] <@Ranryu692> @DrTomT18 remember when he was on Community
[2:13:38] <M0untain_wolf> Batarians !
[2:13:38] <hereiam407> I hope this is playing during first contact
[2:13:42] <dawarw0lf> @meltoras12 It’s like a good 20 minutes of it
[2:13:44] <oda_flobunaga> Keith David in Planescape Torment is the best
[2:13:47] <moonmintparadise> i love how shephard is just standing there
[2:13:47] <%AmericanSkidd> @TourettesPlays LUL

[2:14:04] <+DatAsuna> @alphonseisbest but also fuck twitter for that too
[2:14:06] <%RealThiele> hahaha ugly mom
[2:14:07] <%Monkeyweed21> THE FIRST RACIST JOKES
[2:14:09] <%ape_hawk> OH, RACISM
[2:14:11] <%andrewofbob> @TourettesPlays It speaks more of how to the Turians it was no biggie
[2:14:13] <stantheman_97> LUL
[2:14:14] <+Vigonept> man shit jokes are great in bad times
[2:14:16] <+crustypunky> kek
[2:14:17] <@Ranryu692> @DatAsuna Maybe that was for the best. It means if they get their act together they can still make a good Contact War game LUL
[2:14:20] <M0untain_wolf> Killed all deam batarians !
[2:14:21] <Badgerconda_> KILL THE BIRDMEN
[2:14:21] <peachy996> Assholes and Elbows, Anderson Come Here, COME HERE
[2:14:22] <%DrTomT18> Is that a thing?
[2:14:22] <PaperyHornet1013> get fucked garrus
[2:14:24] <%lumporr> GROUNDBREAKING RACISM
[2:14:27] <hereiam407> Garrus: "It is what it is."
[2:14:28] <Goraka91> Hey they started it
[2:14:28] <$lotharrio> But Garrus was cool with it. War crimes rule.
[2:14:29] <%DrTomT18> His grandfather died in the war?
[2:14:29] <%Monkeyweed21> the first racism against another species
[2:14:35] <SaltyAzteca> WE GOT NUKES, KNIVES, SHARP STICKS
[2:14:40] <BallerSwagBro9k> Yo momma jokes
[2:14:45] <+Vigonept> he loves warcrimes
[2:14:46] <peachy996> Not Garrus, Saren
[2:14:50] <@commanderclaw> "The Commander's dick is SOOO HUGE"
[2:14:57] <peachy996> Saren's Brother dies in the War and he gets buttmad about it
[2:14:58] <TourettesPlays> @TourettesPlays god I wish the space raptors would descend on us and wipe us out/enslave us to reproduce with the females and sometimes males too
[2:15:00] <rytisone> Pat just keeps losing PATrons
[2:15:03] <M0untain_wolf> Big dic specter Shepard
[2:15:05] <Coystick> This is "We could only book Keith David for a minimum 8 hour block, so lets get our money's worth"
[2:15:07] <%AkronymCLT> RIP Grampus
[2:15:13] <%alphonseisbest> @commanderclaw YEA IT IS
[2:15:13] <%MalekDracarus> MalekDracarus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! I think Twitch ate my message. This is the first live stream I've caught in 3 months so your vods give me life. Keep up the good work
[2:15:15] <%MelBrooksKA> You think Garrus' grandpa was a bigger faccy
[2:15:24] <pmtriox> always a "i should go"
[2:15:26] <moonmintparadise> he said that while making himself some coffee ?
[2:15:31] <%BinaryFireball> shepard is traumatized af
[2:15:32] <KaitlynnHere> Look at that future fridge!
[2:15:33] <Vadrigar1994> Shepard probably didn't know saying "No Sir" was even an option
[2:15:38] <ARDM112> Illusive Man killing Saren's brother during the First Contact War in some dumb comic is the weirdest lore cross-polination they ever went with
[2:15:47] <SaltyAzteca> Shepard.
[2:15:48] <M0untain_wolf> Shapard
[2:15:49] <moonmintparadise> I love it when sci-fi settings just leave tablets lying around
[2:15:49] <%ape_hawk> AND HIS DICK IS SO FULL OF CUM
[2:15:54] <+PunkZedB> shepard
[2:15:54] <%lumporr> Cocks like Shepard's? Rarest in the galaxy.
[2:15:57] <@Ranryu692> @MalekDracarus I noticed your attempt earlier; you sent it just in the chat while he was on BRB screen, just fyi
[2:15:58] <Allenou> ART
[2:15:59] <cpt_langosta> that art sucks
[2:16:01] <%AmericanSkidd> @Vadrigar1994 it was not on the Dialog Wheel
[2:16:01] <stantheman_97> shepard
[2:16:02] <%DrTomT18> big art
[2:16:07] <Minorou> Shepard could totally complain in the past. Heck, it's one of the first options. "I don't like a Turian observing me on the mission"
[2:16:10] <M0untain_wolf> TURIANS
[2:16:13] <KaitlynnHere> It’s very….
[2:16:14] <Goraka91> Yeah big warcrimes!
[2:16:16] <%lumporr> Shepard? Hung like a thresher maw.
[2:16:16] <+PunkZedB> eyes like Shepard's? most special in the galaxy
[2:16:19] <ghosrevan> fuck them turians
[2:16:22] <Coystick> @ARDM112 I fucking hate it when EU stuff does that kinda stuff, just shrinks the universe so bad
[2:16:23] <%DrTomT18> man, an apartment like this would probably cost over a million dollars
[2:16:24] <KaitlynnHere> Lol
[2:16:29] <KaitlynnHere> Hhhhhmmmm mmmmmmm
[2:16:38] <%X2Eliah> @DrTomT18 yup
[2:16:38] <peachy996> The sticks up their asses are top notch
[2:16:43] <Goraka91> Remember, to the Turians civilians don't exist
[2:16:45] <Vadrigar1994> "I have a great respect for the Turian military, what great facsists"
[2:16:47] <%jillyrancher> It's a David Cage apartment TehePelo
[2:16:48] <M0untain_wolf> Turinan point
[2:16:49] <+DatAsuna> boo

[2:16:49] <+skeletonmilk> turding point
[2:16:51] <%AmericanSkidd> Turdians
[2:16:54] <@Ranryu692> @DrTomT18 if the citadel is anything like New York, more like 5-10 million
[2:16:56] <DracaenaLeaf> good try
[2:16:57] <%lumporr> @ARDM112 Star Wars is like 8 planets
[2:16:58] <+bubblebasspickles> moar like TURDians amirite?

[2:17:56] <%strakillias> That bed is smaller than the TV in that room
[2:17:58] <+Vigonept> whats wrong with doubles.
[2:17:58] <%DrTomT18> Theres a piece of lore that says that the Krogan invited some aliens to play Krogan football and some of them died.
[2:17:59] <KaitlynnHere> Eh
[2:18:01] <Jetsfantasy> It's stubby
[2:18:01] <pmtriox> weirdly short but damn wide

[2:25:44] <%Faustgesicht> rOBOT MAN
[2:25:44] <%faintsmile> its fine hes a cyborg
[2:25:45] <$Mekhet09> This scenario only makes sense if you don't have biotic powers. It's almost like they thought no one would want the cool biotic powers.
[2:25:47] <+SmigGames> why was the floor, glass?
[2:25:51] <KaitlynnHere> Get fucked
[2:25:52] <%strakillias> Good thing Shepard is some sort of cool robot man

[2:26:02] <%AmericanSkidd> because they had time to make this
[2:26:02] <Mattais88> Becasue this was the apology for the game
[2:26:02] <@Ranryu692> because they actually had long enough to make this
[2:26:02] <%alphonseisbest> RIGHT
[2:26:02] <ctk96> Super cyborg shepard

[2:26:05] <KaitlynnHere> @smiggames because it’s cool
[2:26:05] <Sp3ctre48> Cause they had more time to make this good
[2:26:07] <Treasure_Vault> Cause it took 3 games to figure out how to make this one dlc
[2:26:09] <%captainpodock> captainpodock subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Still waiting for my damn furniture to come in for my new house so I'm forced to watch this stream in an old office chair but at least I get to watch my favorite streamer play Mass Effect 3's best  DLC, happy 19 months!
[2:26:11] <%WeLucklessJacks> NOT THE FISH
[2:26:11] <%trackles_64> THey ran out of time
[2:26:11] <%Deft_Thought> Didn't she get shot in the chest
[2:26:11] <moonmintparadise> how is she alive ??
[2:26:12] <T_Sasquatch> Alien sushi sounds like a very bad idea
[2:26:12] <some_brave_apollo> because they wrote themselves into a corner by making the reapers relevant post-ME1
[2:26:13] <+cermo55> the good part hasn't even started yet
[2:26:13] <tanarath> Cowardice & forumlaeic writing
[2:26:13] <%alphonseisbest> CITIDEL IS SOOOOO GOOD
[2:26:14] <godila2> cause lets rush it not take time
[2:26:14] <%coward_man> because I think this was made with a different writing team or something?
[2:26:18] <SaltyAzteca> How is she okay, didnt she get-oh

[2:27:15] <$hattrick61> @captainpodock theres probably painkillers in it, so sure
[2:27:15] <+SataruYamate> like, there could be a mass effect spin off game that takes place in just the citdel, place is huuuge
[2:27:22] <%DrTomT18> tbh this is one of my favroite missions
[2:27:23] <%GarbageNirvana> Even in the future you still need HVAC
[2:27:30] <some_brave_apollo> its weird how the citadel looks a lot like LA in 2019
[2:27:36] <peachy996> Salarian havin a smoke

[2:28:08] <@TheYellowcouch> Time!
[2:28:08] <Jetsfantasy> Cause it was sold seperately
[2:28:10] <TheQuadrupleS> SHHHHHHH
[2:28:11] <Zombrocom> Hey.
[2:28:13] <@Ranryu692> they actually had time to make this
[2:28:13] <%Aleate> It gets better too
[2:28:14] <Minorou> did this DLC have a different writer?
[2:28:14] <%andrewofbob> This was like the fucking swan song of the team
[2:28:15] <+Soliloquy123> As someone who also likes to hide out in the freezer at work, I resonate with this
[2:28:17] <BurdRightsActivist> SPACE DICKERY
[2:28:18] <%RealThiele> MONEE
[2:28:19] <Dio_TR> THE BEST
[2:28:20] <mr_saturday93> MONEY AND TIME
[2:28:21] <%Saadi90> You have seen nothing!
[2:28:21] <@commanderclaw> Cause Bioware *refuses* to do small scale conflicts
[2:28:23] <+Them00n> They got time to make this, unlike the rest of the game.
[2:28:25] <ctk96> Cause EA is no fun
[2:28:25] <+GingerStrawhat> Cuase it's end of the Trilogy DLC
[2:28:26] <+critikal_bit> I would SO buy a game that just took place in the Citadel
[2:28:26] <%JamesCorck> Is the frustration setting in already Pat?
[2:28:26] <%jillyrancher> Cause it's an apology dude
[2:28:28] <%Faustgesicht> SCALE BRO
[2:28:28] <jorniev> TRUTH

[2:28:29] <%DrTomT18> THATS WHY SHEPARD TOOK A DAY OFF
[2:28:31] <+D00msDayDan> stakes don't need to be galaxy-threatening for the story to be engaging
[2:28:31] <peachy996> I want to save the Block
[2:28:32] <tanarath> @patstaresat Bad head writer/producer/director
[2:28:35] <%jillyrancher> that too. time.
[2:28:36] <peachy996> Fuck the world
[2:28:36] <$Mekhet09> HE"S A BIOTIC HE ALWAYS HAS WEAPONS

[2:30:20] <brandt_connors> you can still use your biotics PAt
[2:30:20] <T_Sasquatch> To be fair, how does one determine of an alien species is food
[2:30:20] <%captainpodock> Pat was right, just put a game set in the wards, the citadel is huge enough and is the cultural hub of the universe.
[2:30:23] <%jillyrancher> Hell yeah they suck that why Cat6 rules
[2:30:24] <$Mekhet09> okay you can.

[2:30:55] <%cvp5127> LUL

[2:31:03] <%ape_hawk> pat, any part of the citadel youre in has trash in it
[2:31:03] <ohno778> SUS
[2:31:03] <Tracazoid> Hanar crossing
[2:31:06] <rytisone> it needs elcor
[2:31:11] <+DatAsuna> ew fruit lickiers
[2:31:12] <%stickislaw> licking the fruit lmao
[2:31:12] <Sp3ctre48> They aren't going to, but Mass 4 Effect drastically lowering the stakes and just having a dumb adventure like this would be so good
[2:31:13] <%DrTomT18> Its not stealing if you are Commander Shepard
[2:31:13] <%jillyrancher> adorable
[2:31:14] <%BlackStarAura> “Licking the fruit” note is the best
[2:31:15] <T_Sasquatch> @captainpodock it would have to be incredibly expansive
[2:31:15] <PaperyHornet1013> I KNOW YOUR LICKING THE FRUIT
[2:31:16] <%AmericanSkidd> stop licking that shit
[2:31:17] <%captainpodock> @some_brave_apollo they float
[2:31:21] <@Ranryu692> @ape_hawk yeah, the Batarians are everywhere
[2:31:21] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:31:22] <%Deft_Thought> Is Shepard stealing credits from these people?
[2:31:22] <scrumbotime> I mean, if you're a big jellyfish, the sign that shows Human Body Walking isn't going to have the same connotations
[2:31:25] <%Deft_Thought> The fuck, man?
[2:31:26] <@TheYellowcouch> The level design is also fucking excellent
[2:31:26] <%jillyrancher> LOOK AT THE LITTLE HANAR
[2:31:30] <jorniev> AND THERE IS MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND
[2:31:30] <$hattrick61> getting real ratchet and clank vibes from this soundtrack
[2:31:32] <Treasure_Vault> Is the Citadel DS9 but with extra steps?
[2:31:40] <Goraka91> @Deft_Thought Spectre business
[2:31:48] <%Dabrikishaw> The rest of the game isn't like this because this is meant to be a last hurrah mission for the crew and the player. Making the stakes lower was required by design.
[2:31:56] <%AmericanSkidd> its fine, ITS FINE
[2:32:06] <Sp3ctre48> Stop making fun of me BibleThump
[2:32:09] <%miguelrod777> mods in the stores

[2:32:17] <rytisone> "Garrus I'm on baby mode, it's fine"
[2:32:17] <T_Sasquatch> If i recall this dlc is meant to be an apology
[2:32:24] <moonmeh> oh no

[2:32:41] <kingra> Is shepard just stealing the shopkeepers money?
[2:32:42] <%strakillias> No, I am Shepard. I MUST banter.
[2:32:46] <@Ranryu692> weren't the Vorcha only first contacted too recently for that?
[2:32:48] <%coward_man> hey look, ordinary stores

[2:33:01] <%DrTomT18> Asari and Vorcha - not a pairing I would expect
[2:33:02] <AngryAsian5> Definitely the creepy kind
[2:33:02] <@Spydurman> if ME3 had more of this charm and a semi decent ending it'd be like a 9/10
[2:33:03] <Sp3ctre48> I think it's the creepy kind
[2:33:04] <+DatAsuna> what a caring boss
[2:33:04] <%akscully> van allen belts LuL
[2:33:10] <%jillyrancher> Cat6 are legit well designed enemies with cool abilities

[3:44:07] <+CyanDeadEye> They took them off for the casino
[3:44:08] <@Ranryu692> You have the M1 Suppressor
[3:44:08] <%X2Eliah> You skipped the selection
[3:44:09] <%afronooch> they toook them away for the sushi place
[3:44:09] <$lotharrio> You forgot to re-equip
[3:44:09] <M0untain_wolf> you had a chance Pat

[3:44:12] <%jillyrancher> NO BABY MODE NOW ADULT
[3:44:12] <%shurtal> anderson's apartment didn't have any
[3:44:13] <%coward_man> cause you didn't go to the weapon bench in the apartment
[3:44:13] <dawarw0lf> That was you
[3:44:15] <+Them00n> You skipped over equiping
[3:44:16] <AllenDeadman> BACKDOWN
[3:44:16] <%sunsetdisc0> steve is great. wish he was an actual character and not some schumck they threw together in the character creator
[3:44:16] <%AmuserName> @PatStaresAt You had your "special loadout" with the Stealth Pistol
[3:44:16] <+Ropcord> there's a bench in the apartment
[3:44:17] <Sp3ctre48> I thought you did this to make the fight last longer
[3:44:17] <brandt_connors> your fault
[3:44:18] <+Arnschen> ?
[3:44:19] <Dio_TR> YOU SKIPPED IT
[3:44:20] <%alphonseisbest> YOU ARE THE GUN
[3:44:20] <%DrTomT18> because you unequip them for the Casino Mission
[3:44:21] <%InternetShis> Defaulted after pistol-only
[3:44:23] <DSD24> Oh shit is that a Prothean?
[3:44:24] <stantheman_97> this is just fanservice: the dlc and I'm here for it
[3:44:24] <%afronooch> tthen you didnt re-equip because youre normal
[3:44:25] <%AmericanSkidd> its fine
[3:44:27] <+Them00n> This game is unfinished, that's why
[3:44:28] <+Arnschen> When you started the mission
[3:44:29] <TourettesPlays> sometimes games unequip your weapons Pat you know this
[3:44:29] <+DatAsuna> doesn't matter anyway, it's ez mode
[3:44:29] <$lotharrio> Because the previous sequence un-equipped them then gave you the stealth gun
[3:44:31] <%andrewofbob> Your loadout was overridden on the stealth section
[3:44:35] <AllenDeadman> we tried to warn you
[3:44:41] <SaltyAzteca> Pat you ARE the gun
[3:44:43] <$MrWurmles> That's not how the game works Pat.

[3:44:50] <TourettesPlays> Pat its an EA game from 2011 of course its stupid
[3:44:52] <wolfen091> boss, put a shirt on
[3:44:57] <+Vigonept> but immersion and rolepalay and making sense though
[3:44:58] <%afronooch> good then your a vanguard Kappa
[3:45:01] <@Ranryu692> Well, they did force you to look at the weapon select screen

[3:50:19] <+GingerStrawhat> Nah it's two halves, one full on mission and the other half is the party
[3:50:20] <%professionalwitchburner> It's a MURDER PARTY
[3:50:21] <+xp194> There's a /LOT/ in Citadel
[3:50:22] <dawarw0lf> There’s 3 parts

[3:50:23] <%JamesCorck> Yeah Pat, we know what you mean 8 |
[3:50:25] <%afronooch> There's ALOT to citadel, thats we we said it might be a couple stream
[3:50:26] <+DatAsuna> One of the few good things about andromeda is they also do this, but the AI squadmates aren't fake so you have them all there for reals instead of in the background
[3:50:27] <SilverFaustX> chat all agree, this is also a party
[3:50:30] <@Ranryu692> it's why we kept saying you were too ambitious saying you were beating the game in one stream
[3:50:32] <+GingerStrawhat> This is probably why you may need two more streams to finish up ME3
[3:50:32] <%AmericanSkidd> The party was just a BONUS
[3:50:41] <TourettesPlays> Garrus is dead
[3:50:42] <%andrewofbob> There's an area with more ambient dialogue; they went full ham on this

[3:51:47] <quipquest1> See, the problem with the dialogue is that, if the series was always like this, it wouldn't be off-putting? It hasn't been like this, ever, so it sucks.

[3:54:16] <@Ranryu692> @stantheman_97 they have explained it, actually. I forget the specifics, but basically the reapers left the translation tech in the citadel for aliens to use

[3:56:20] <@Ranryu692> to look cool
[3:56:23] <%DrTomT18> Put a melee weapon on his gun
[3:56:23] <mighty_fine_trousers> Just opened up. Is he finishing the game tonight?
[3:56:27] <%InternetShis> This is such a B-movie plot I love it
[3:56:28] <jtsoppy137> for show
[3:56:29] <%HotSauceFiend> cause a shotgun is best at close range
[3:56:31] <+Vigonept> cause guns rock
[3:56:32] <$lotharrio> To attache bayonets to.
[3:56:34] <%AmericanSkidd> for cowards who run away
[3:56:35] <Sp3ctre48> So he can attach a big sword to his gun for more melee damage
[3:56:36] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Gun is best hammer
[3:56:36] <%GhoulishCripple> @patstaresat to trick people into thinking he'll use it
[3:56:37] <%dekkitout> The gun is a false reassurance for his enemies. They ASSUME he would only shoot them
[3:56:37] <peyodogo> oh man im so sad ive missed four hours of this
[3:56:39] <+Ropcord> he has a gun so he can hit people with it
[3:56:40] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> They never see it coming
[3:56:42] <%CasualSleepyGamer> Because the game damands you have one
[3:56:42] <dawarw0lf> It can have a blade on the shotgun
[3:56:43] <%DrTomT18> hey look, genocide!
[3:56:45] <+Javaa01> Hey sometimes you need something that can reach one and a half arm's length away
[3:56:45] <Explodincatz> give him a Bayhelit
[3:56:46] <LLCoolZJ> thought he was going to say now whos your daddy
[3:56:49] <AllenDeadman> for fun
[3:56:49] <DSD24> Brooke sucks ass
[3:56:50] <@Ranryu692> also you should give him some bayonets next time you're on the weapon select screen
[3:56:51] <%DrTomT18> Go back to that one, Pat!
[3:56:56] <peachy996> Find the other lore room
[3:56:57] <%professionalwitchburner> In the MP, if you played as a Krogan you EXCLUSIVELY meleed everyone
[3:56:57] <%miguelrod777> rip that one ended early
[3:57:00] <%JoshManVGH> man, imagine a krogan going to battle with a giant axe. that would be sick
[3:57:01] <+Arnschen> Oh no
[3:57:01] <M0untain_wolf> nope
[3:57:02] <godila2> go back pat
[3:57:03] <$lotharrio> Will that lore re-pop?
[3:57:03] <%DrTomT18> ops, oh well
[3:57:07] <%Dakuu75> Shouldn't some Legion robots be here?
[3:57:08] <%KetsuoTaberu> oof
[3:57:09] <%AmericanSkidd> oops
[3:57:09] <%DrTomT18> The AIs beg not to be killed
[3:57:10] <dawarw0lf> Nope
[3:57:11] <%InternetShis> Fuck
[3:57:12] <MrPandastic> Every time I see you look at Wrex in the middle of a fight he's back handed someone's soul out of their body.
[3:57:18] <Teras_ode> it had dialogue
[3:57:20] <%miguelrod777> ai saying not to kill them
[3:57:22] <cpt_langosta> don't talk with your mouth full
[3:57:23] <Ids560> it was another example of the game's ending being bad
[3:57:32] <quipquest1> Pat: They aren't Legion, so I don't care.
[3:57:33] <%jillyrancher> GO BACK YOU STILL CAN
[3:57:33] <olm46> How could we have avoided wars with these evil AIs!?
[3:57:36] <some_brave_apollo> maybe they should have risen up like the geth
[3:57:38] <Goraka91> But AI and organics CANNOT coexist! Never ever!
[3:57:41] <@Ranryu692> @jillyrancher the door was locked
[3:57:41] <Teras_ode> nice roll
[3:57:42] <%DrTomT18> @Ids560 At that point it had to be on purpose
[3:57:43] <+cermo55> kill all enemies before checking records
[3:57:45] <%jillyrancher> PAT WHYYYY
[3:57:46] <Vantesla> AI was peaceful and they where slaughter and the information was sealed.
[3:57:50] <%Dakuu75> I've been told that bread makes you fat

[3:58:20] <knight_verse> volumes a tad low Pat, both you and the game
[3:58:24] <%valriot> Bread is the worst, its just RAW carbs
[3:58:25] <MrPandastic> Imagine being shot by incendiary bullets while also being punched by a krogan.
[3:58:25] <T_Sasquatch> everything makes you fat

[4:02:00] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Would Wrex love a bulldog
[4:02:01] <+vaderxyz1970> Bulldogs are one of the dogs that can't live in the wild

[4:02:14] <%HotSauceFiend> is he making noises
[4:02:14] <+JonathLP> Not even a man made mistake
[4:02:15] <SilverFaustX> dogs are all man made
[4:02:17] <%dekkitout> Those enviornmental pressures were intended
[4:02:17] <KaitlynnHere> He just slapped your tit
[4:02:18] <%trackles_64> its shephard dog
[4:02:18] <+Them00n> Bulldogs got it rough huh?
[4:02:18] <@Ranryu692> Zangief is a GMO
[4:02:22] <%JoshManVGH> This dog is s work of SCIENCE!I
[4:02:22] <rytisone> man made huh?
[4:02:26] <cpt_langosta> that is AD: Artificial Dog
[4:02:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> awww
[4:02:27] <%SinnerEbru> his wittle tongue 😭
[4:02:28] <quipquest1> But it's all worth it for the high-five
[4:02:30] <+johnnychopsocky> Zangief is an adorable affront to nature
[4:02:31] <+vaderxyz1970> Bulldogs can only give birth through C sections
[4:02:32] <%Dakuu75> YEAH, third times the charm
[4:02:32] <%Treuan> Trying to get away with minimal speak effort
[4:02:33] <%MidnightBurst12> tiny arf
[4:02:33] <@TheYellowcouch> custom made creature
[4:02:35] <Sartastic> that was an oink
[4:02:35] <%ConLin_Arts_> how is he so perfect?
[4:02:35] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> If you cross breed them with a dog with a normal face they all be healthier
[4:02:35] <%baka_sugoi> FREAK
[4:02:37] <@Spydurman> the ultimate bio weapon
[4:02:37] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt did you see the guy selective breeding bulldogs to get em back to looking like they used to?
[4:02:38] <$lotharrio> If their snouts were bigger, they'd be happier... but not as ugly-cute.
[4:02:38] <T_Sasquatch> pugs are worse
[4:02:39] <%MelBrooksKA> In fairness, wolves are the non-man made dogs
[4:02:40] <%miguelrod777> geif is a krogan
[4:02:42] <%hrbeck_> Bulldogs are born by c section 100% of the time
[4:02:43] <AllenDeadman> much like bananas, mostly man made
[4:02:44] <%Monkeyweed21> much like Paige, Zangief was not made naturally
[4:02:45] <macathelo> pat:speak
[4:02:47] <%ScrapKingKeita> Look at pugs from when they became a breed and compare them to now and you get depresseed
[4:02:48] <%AmericanSkidd> like a spore creature

[4:26:17] <%alphonseisbest> YUP
[4:26:17] <%AmuserName> Specific to LEAST TAKEN SQUADDIE
[4:26:17] <@TheYellowcouch> of course it's wrex

[4:26:20] <some_brave_apollo> nobody takes kaiden anyway
[4:26:20] <%SinnerEbru> its thebchar you rarely pick
[4:26:21] <BallerSwagBro9k> yup
[4:26:21] <%notsoy> i hope not and it's a meta thing about nobody liking kaidan
[4:26:22] <%shurtal> It's specific to him being Carth
[4:26:22] <%AmericanSkidd> no, but it may as well
[4:26:22] <teefpal> The one who gets picked least says it
[4:26:23] <T_Sasquatch> RIP KAIDEN
[4:26:24] <Zombrocom> Maybe?
[4:26:24] <KaitlynnHere> I’m sowwy wrex
[4:26:24] <Minorou> James says it too
[4:26:25] <$hattrick61> it choses your least used member
[4:26:25] <%professionalwitchburner> @patstaresat Your least picked character says that
[4:26:26] <dawarw0lf> Maybe
[4:26:26] <%ScrapKingKeita> @PatStaresAt Your most picked and LEast Picked members comment for getting left behind, depending on whether they are most or least
[4:26:26] <%Ipsenscastle> No-one ever takes Kaiden LUL so we'll never know
[4:26:26] <%miguelrod777> Depends but yeah
[4:26:27] <+taggerung403> Nobody knows
[4:26:27] <+cermo55> the least chosen members get the lines
[4:26:27] <$lotharrio> It's reactive to your picks
[4:26:27] <+Ropcord> YEP
[4:26:28] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt its wrex or your most picked companion otherwise
[4:26:29] <@Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt Ashley says "I never get to go"
[4:26:29] <%Dabrikishaw> Don't worry Kaiden, I always take you when I can
[4:26:30] <+xp194> It changes, yes
[4:26:31] <%sunsetdisc0> your least picked companion will always chime in saying how they never get picked
[4:26:31] <quipquest1> I took him once and still got that
[4:26:33] <SaltyAzteca> Kaiden't
[4:26:33] <%AmericanSkidd> OH IT DOES
[4:26:33] <Virokwet> ashley has one too
[4:26:34] <stormhawk9891> It's for your two least used teammates
[4:26:34] <%cvp5127> kaidan destroyed
[4:26:35] <%afronooch> It's specific to who take the least, which is usually Kaiden or ashley
[4:26:37] <Woodywoo0100> It's whoever you pick the least
[4:26:38] <BurdRightsActivist> Why is this GOOD??
[4:26:39] <+Ropcord> It's always the least picked squadmate that complains LUL
[4:26:40] <%BlackStarAura> Because 99% of players fucking hate him
[4:26:40] <AngryAsian5> I remember replaying the DLC just to get everyone's dialogue. It's so good. LUL
[4:26:41] <%AkronymCLT> For me it was Edi
[4:26:47] <Javier9563> the lancer fucks
[4:26:48] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> JUST MAKE A GAME WHERE ITS ALWAYS THIS GOOD UGH
[4:26:49] <+unhuggable1> best gun
[4:26:52] <T_Sasquatch> Who the fuck would ever pick him
[4:26:55] <Derkinstacker> Hopefully Mass Effect 4 will be more like this.
[4:26:55] <SaltyAzteca> 40 points LUL
[4:26:56] <+DatAsuna> IDK, maybe we shoudl replace with a weaker ammo based gun
[4:26:57] <M0untain_wolf> Pat the ammo Mods do nothing
[4:26:59] <KaitlynnHere> @blackstaraura because he’s soooo boring
[4:27:01] <%dekkitout> LuvUok
[4:27:02] <dawarw0lf> It was garrus for me which is dumb because he was always there so idk
[4:27:03] <SilverFaustX> paige fall
[4:27:05] <BallerSwagBro9k> OH NO LUL
[4:27:07] <%AmericanSkidd> hm
[4:27:07] <$MrWurmles> I love Wrex's delivery on that mopy "I wanted to go."

[4:27:09] <%trackles_64> paige?
[4:27:12] <Teras_ode> never bothered huh
[4:27:14] <KaitlynnHere> Uh oh
[4:27:14] <%KetsuoTaberu> paige?
[4:27:14] <cpt_langosta> *sounds of offscreen ham violence*
[4:27:20] <%lumporr> @T_Sasquatch Cool Alien, Strong Alien, Smart Alien, or White Bread
[4:27:21] <unit24> I don't think I'd want the whole game to be this consistently comedic but as an isolated thing I love it
[4:27:21] <+cermo55> Mass effect 4 better be consistently this good
[4:27:22] <teefpal> domestic violence any%
[4:27:24] <+SmigGames> This DLC is the most fun Pat had with ME3
[4:27:29] <%AmericanSkidd> well, she still breathing
[4:27:30] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> awww Paige okay??
[4:27:30] <KaitlynnHere> Oh she’s cutting onions
[4:27:35] <Ekaelis> @MrWurmles He sounded like a boy who never gets picked to a football team LUL
[4:27:36] <%trackles_64> Sad Paige
[4:27:38] <stantheman_97> wrex was legit hurt you didn't pick him
[4:27:39] <%Aleate> Awwwwwww
[4:27:40] <%X2Eliah> @cermo55 the odds are not in our favour

[4:27:42] <teefpal> LUL
[4:27:42] <%AmericanSkidd> yeah, that checks out
[4:27:44] <%KetsuoTaberu> BibleThump
[4:27:46] <KaitlynnHere> I figured
[4:27:46] <+johnnychopsocky> Citadel is so damn good
[4:27:47] <%UvBenServed> BibleThump
[4:27:47] <%dekkitout> This is why you chop along the poles of onions
[4:27:47] <%Profmcstevie> Cooking for her man BibleThump
[4:27:48] <%lumporr> i'm surprised paige is trusted with blades
[4:27:48] <%trackles_64> Just buy chopped onions
[4:27:49] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @patstaresat put your face in the freezer, it really helps
[4:27:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pat have you not chopped an onion before?
[4:27:53] <%baka_sugoi> DA GASES
[4:27:53] <Tracazoid> I take it Pat has never cut onions
[4:27:55] <teefpal> ye its an irritant
[4:27:55] <olwe123> So she looks super hot
[4:27:55] <Explodincatz> perfect stereotype
[4:27:56] <Teras_ode> BibleThump
[4:27:57] <%smoothwood07> yeah thats what onions do
[4:27:57] <%Profmcstevie> It's an eye/nose thing apparently
[4:27:58] <%akscully> sharpen your knives, paige!
[4:27:58] <tanarath> Paige has onionitus
[4:28:00] <dawarw0lf> Wrex is great on this mission but EVERYONE is
[4:28:01] <KaitlynnHere> It’s the juice
[4:28:02] <%lumporr> also having a bowl of water out helps
[4:28:04] <Brandon__Brando> omg I remember doing that for work it was the fucking worst
[4:28:05] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> IT DOES I SWEAR
[4:28:07] <Treasure_Vault> Sharp knife = no tears
[4:28:07] <SilverFaustX> doesnt she have glasses?
[4:28:10] <Treasure_Vault> or chew gum
[4:28:12] <$MrWurmles> Tell piage to cut off the hairy end  of the onion last. It stops the onion from sweating as much while you are chopping.
[4:28:16] <%trackles_64> F
[4:28:20] <%Aleate> Joker is like ITS FUCKING MINE
[4:28:20] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> chewing gum also helps
[4:28:20] <SaltyAzteca> Oh geez
[4:28:22] <ammobasket> Cut them top to bottom, not across!

[4:37:23] <+Ropcord> Shepard confirmed weak to bullets
[4:37:28] <$MrWurmles> Be sure to check the rooms for prompts.
[4:37:31] <%miguelrod777> check the trash
[4:37:33] <available_line> Did we just steal 15k from Traynor?
[4:37:33] <%AmericanSkidd> you stole some guy's paycheck
[4:37:33] <%colezone_> is it me or does the dialogue feel like a marvel movie
[4:37:34] <%Dakuu75> <3
[4:37:37] <Allenou> Examine the room
[4:37:40] <@Ranryu692> her visor is off
[4:37:47] <SaltyAzteca> Healing arc complete!
[4:37:49] <%BlackStarAura> Poor Boo
[4:37:51] <+johnnychopsocky> did Tali just reference Red October?
[4:37:51] <hereiam407> EDI hates feeling like a normie
[4:37:52] <%bread_assassin> Also if you bring Tali and Wrex she calls him her "crazy headbutting uncle" or something like that.
[4:37:52] <@Ranryu692> I think they showed it once before
[4:37:54] <%castlerock42> Man, I hope that was 15000 each, otherwise the mercs got screwed.
[4:37:54] <shotgang86> who woulda thunk
[4:37:56] <stantheman_97> awwwww
[4:37:56] <homestylewaffles> halo invented quipping
[4:37:57] <some_brave_apollo> @colezone_ this is from 2013
[4:38:01] <badguy8312> do we have any loyalty missions complete?
[4:38:08] <Ekaelis> @Ranryu692 Oh, so her visor is her eyes on the Normandy?
[4:38:09] <Teras_ode> Javik raging in the coms at this moment
[4:38:20] <+xp194> I kinda wish there was unique dialogue from the mercs for taking their pay mid fight
[4:38:22] <FassieFons> awww tali got over her robo-racism
[4:38:23] <shotgang86> man gief came to pat and said "take me out right now or I'll bust your knees"
[4:38:25] <@Ranryu692> @colezone_ they would have have been making this right after the first Avengers movie came out
[4:38:32] <Vantesla> This DLC was a literal love letter to Mass Effect, the characters, and fans.
[4:38:39] <%InternetShis> Citadel has a different writing team and doesn't take itself seriously at all
[4:38:49] <rytisone> if only EA didn't rush this game
[4:38:49] <KnivesEve> oh did i miss the dlc stream?
[4:38:51] <+johnnychopsocky> quips existed before Avengers
[4:38:54] <%AmericanSkidd> its dumb in the best ways possible
[4:38:57] <shotgang86> @InternetShis oh that's why its good
[4:39:06] <@Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 I guess? Seems they chose that as a way of visually representing that she's disconnected from the ship
[4:39:07] <+xp194> IMO Citadel is the best piece of ME content period
[4:39:09] <AllenDeadman> @KnivesEve we on the end stretch
[4:39:13] <%X2Eliah> So y'all now we must make sure Pat does the individual character meetups before triggering the big party, right?
[4:39:14] <dawarw0lf> Comedy existed before Avengers guys
[4:39:15] <+DatAsuna> @KnivesEve nah just taking a brb for dog reasons
[4:39:22] <+geekjacob> Are we allowed too post clips in here from this stream?
[4:39:24] <+johnnychopsocky> This is F&F in space
[4:39:27] <Brandon__Brando> @dawarw0lf no
[4:39:32] <+xp194> It takes itself just seriously enough
[4:39:37] <dawarw0lf> @x2eliah Do we have time for alll of that? The talks are an hour long
[4:39:39] <+DatAsuna> @xp194 everyone agrees
[4:39:42] <%BlackStarAura> And some Armax Arena fights, if we’re lucky
[4:39:49] <badguy8312> @johnnychopsocky id say there's a lot more fucking
[4:39:51] <dawarw0lf> The party itself is an hour long.
[4:39:52] <+CyanDeadEye> Wrex will ask the Virmire survivor if they remember in ME1 when he asked who would win a fight between them and Shepard and how they would now be able to find out.
[4:39:53] <KnivesEve> oh cool i had other shit to do so i couldnt stay before.
[4:39:57] <some_brave_apollo> @dawarw0lf if you don't think this dialogue isn't aping Whedon, you're just wrong
[4:40:04] <dawarw0lf> There’s 2 hours plus the arena
[4:40:06] <some_brave_apollo> or is
[4:40:11] <some_brave_apollo> tenses
[4:40:15] <KnivesEve> least i got here for ending
[4:40:18] <+johnnychopsocky> Pat also needs to hit up the Yakuza-ass coliseum
[4:40:33] <%AmericanSkidd> dont forget all the dates with the crew
[4:40:33] <olaksi> Bioware always had a boner for joss whedon style dialogue... sometimes it gets pretty bad
[4:40:40] <unit24> I think the whedon-ness of the DLC dialogue could stand to be turned down just a taaaad bit, but I think the good outweighs the bad
[4:40:48] <dawarw0lf> @some_brave_apollo I mean avengers 1 is a funny movie so who cares if so?
[4:41:06] <unit24> some bits are genuinely funny and others just make me roll my eyes
[4:41:08] <some_brave_apollo> I don't think avengers is funny at all
[4:41:16] <tanarath> @unit24 The toothbrush was gold and you know it
[4:41:26] <some_brave_apollo> but then i also don't like anything Joss Whedon has written so I could just be wrong
[4:41:28] <dawarw0lf> It’s not like this dlc is full comedy. The stuff with thane is sweet
[4:41:33] <cpt_langosta> wait, ppl are complaining that the writing in this DLC is good? WTF
[4:41:34] <oda_flobunaga> *It would obviously be soooo much better if this were written like a Zach Snyder movie*
[4:41:36] <%Ipsenscastle> Alistair in Dragon Age was based off Xander from Buffy apparently
[4:41:42] <%AmericanSkidd> Chekov's Toothbrush
[4:41:43] <+SkimLives> SkimLives subscribed with Prime. 
[4:41:57] <unit24> @tanarath oh yeah I like that bit, it's just a lot of other cookie cutter one liners that are just whatever
[4:42:06] <%dekkitout> Is there a preffered stream of auteur derrived humor in sci fi?
[4:42:06] <unit24> like a lot of brooks' dialogue
[4:42:06] <+taggerung403> make sure the hamster is ok
[4:42:06] <%X2Eliah> Guys the original ending is written like a zack snyder movie
[4:42:07] <+johnnychopsocky> whedon didn't goddamn invent quips either Jesus christ
[4:42:10] <%Ipsenscastle> If anything, both Marvel and Bioware cribbed a lot of writing style from Buffy
[4:42:10] <dawarw0lf> @some_brave_apollo Well Whedon is cringe so I understand. Hulk and Black widow was bad.
[4:42:10] <some_brave_apollo> @oda_flobunaga there's more than two writers in the entire world. stop companywarring
[4:42:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cpt_langosta some people want their serious thing to super serious no jokes allowed
[4:42:18] <Brandon__Brando> pat no
[4:42:20] <%AmericanSkidd> take a look around first
[4:42:26] <%InternetShis> Nothin' much
[4:42:29] <%InternetShis> YEAH

[5:07:21] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Max is filled with P O W E R
[5:07:23] <%professionalwitchburner> Pestily did a 48hr stream, I think
[5:07:23] <+JustToWatch> Pat did 8-9 hours for Hollow Knight
[5:07:26] <%jtdobyns> Streaming is not physically demanding.... But mentally draining
[5:07:27] <DusK_The_Stray> Gotta compete with Korone's endurance streams
[5:07:27] <$MrWurmles> I've streaming for 5-7 hours at once semi-regularly the problem for me is that life gets in the way and stops me from being able to start back up. But almost nobody watches my stuff so....
[5:07:28] <%MelBrooksKA> I remember going to bed and waking up to find Franz still streaming sometimes
[5:07:29] <+GingerStrawhat> Was that a FF14 stream?
[5:07:29] <%Ipsenscastle> Those Hollow Knight streams were great
[5:07:31] <quipquest1> @Monkeyweed21 How is his baby daughter still awake for those?
[5:07:31] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat For real 8 hours straight of playing in front of a chat sounds miserable
[5:07:33] <wolfen091> oh I know, its cause pats British, the guys I watch from there do like 3 hours max

[5:07:37] <%alphonseisbest> yup HW
[5:07:38] <%JamesCorck> Pat didn't you do FF14 Shadowbringers for like 13 hours?
[5:07:40] <%MelBrooksKA> when Franz likes a game he just fucking goes
[5:07:42] <%JamesCorck> Wow delay.
[5:07:44] <ctk96> Pat subathon? 48 hours LUL LUL
[5:07:49] <%SveriSageAdvice> what about when you did Hollow Knight?
[5:07:52] <Brandon__Brando> fuck 24 hour streams have your boss tell you to do a 24 hour shift
[5:07:52] <%Saadi90> Max streams are crazy long
[5:07:55] <%Monkeyweed21> @quipquest1 babies can and will wake up randomly in the middle of the night
[5:07:59] <%jillyrancher> I cannot marathon games anymore
[5:07:59] <+johnnychopsocky> I could never stream games.  My ADHD puts me in "maximum concentration and silence' mode

[5:08:31] <Vantesla> Got a fiance and big baby doggo kinda difficult to do long streams with such lovely distractions SeemsGood. Especially at the age of 30 it isn't like say a decade ago in terms of energy LUL
[5:08:43] <%shurtal> might as well get paid
[5:08:46] <wolfen091> do you think giraffes taste good?
[5:08:47] <%AmericanSkidd> may as well
[5:08:48] <%TheWinged7> just dont make yourself stream the entire thing
[5:08:51] <DusK_The_Stray> My favorite was one of the long Hollow Knight streams that ended at like 4AM and one guy during the ending just goes "But I just got here!"
