[0:19:16] <wiffernubbin> The boy bird pees on the eggs
[0:19:18] <%Valdorick> I mean... to be fair... the cum does need to go to the egg. Just... for Mammals.
[0:19:18] <laserbeaming> they kiss with their cloacas
[0:19:18] <%Undenizen> to be fair, it's really weird how birds do it
[0:19:20] <frostyjay3> I... don't think that's how reproduction works, but okay.
[0:19:20] <%Taisuru> EGG
[0:19:20] <%baka_sugoi> fish cum

[0:19:23] <%X2Eliah> Birds do cuk, but not like that
[0:19:24] <%walternatorz> PAIGE IS NOW INSUFFERABLE
[0:19:26] <Broken_Sonex> Are you implying his head will crack open? @PatStaresAt
[0:19:27] <RushUnplugged> Paige broke biology already

[0:19:31] <%Zetheos> mornin' buddies
[0:19:32] <AGood_Noodle> Divorce??
[0:19:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> With birds the boy cums in a syringe and injects the cummies into the egg.
[0:19:35] <marvel877> and then the sperm eats the egg and grow up to be a baby. - Charlie, Its Always Sunny.
[0:19:36] <+vehementvadr> birds don't have cock, except ducks, they are evil
[0:19:37] <%Aeogard> but where does Rainbow Dash come in?
[0:19:38] <moonmintparadise> how does paige not know basic information. This must be intentional
[0:19:39] <%SirGO0SE> the peepee bird LUL
[0:19:41] <wiffernubbin> The bird puts the eggs on the counter at Moe's Tavern
[0:19:41] <Link232> Why do I always get immediately cursed whenever I tune into this stream
[0:19:41] <Gallhint> I store all my eggs on a radiator
[0:19:43] <oceanmatt> budda dog, the dog with the budda on it budda dog
[0:19:46] <%Valdorick> Wait, so is the Jar the shell?
[0:19:47] <RushUnplugged> PAIGE IT'S TOO EARLY TO SUNDOWN

[0:19:55] <khotgor> Ducks are the shit, so are Geese/Swans
[0:19:55] <bomfiz> @PatStaresAt wait are hairdressers open? I thought we where in lock down

[0:21:54] <Aydarkzero> yeah yeah
[0:21:54] <%crimsonharvest> the red haired ones
[0:21:57] <nesbitt22> Pat got a haircut nice
[0:21:59] <%AzureGale> Yawns are contagious, exhibit A
[0:22:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PeachSaliva Did you get the Peloton for the live classes? I hear they're really good
[0:22:09] <%barrakuta371> Breathe more
[0:22:09] <%Aeogard> drink more cummy for energy
[0:22:13] <%GinAndRoses> do some speed
[0:22:14] <%miguelrod777> that's coward talk
[0:22:15] <%walternatorz> is Pat intentionally channeling Kermit the frog whenever he yawns now?
[0:22:16] <laserbeaming> I got into monster hunter for the first time since MH Tri.
[0:22:16] <%Dfreddy8> Plague?
[0:22:18] <danielm427> did the dog ate pats hear?
[0:22:19] <%dekkitout> You know what is guzzler-able? tajC
[0:22:36] <bob900000> why?
[0:22:38] <%AzureGale> You should finish it
[0:22:43] <%AncelDeLambert> I never even got to the time skip
[0:22:43] <bob900000> how?
[0:22:49] <%SirGO0SE> the DLC sucks tbh :(
[0:22:51] <khotgor> Kermit is better than Elmo
[0:22:51] <%AzureGale> Of course
[0:22:53] <%SirGO0SE> its super easy
[0:22:55] <%kewlmyc> DLC just gives you 4 new party members. It's not a new route
[0:22:57] <%Nekros4442> The game is indeed not very hard
[0:22:58] <%Aeogard> @PatStaresAt I did Black Eagles, and now Blue Lion with DLC, its a lot easier with dlc
[0:22:59] <%Pigg1yJuffs> I thought you finished three houses, you talked about optimum routes?!
[0:23:00] <danielm427> its not hard
[0:23:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Kiara-chan from Hololive finished it on-stream. This is why the Vtubers are stealing your viewers Pat.
[0:23:04] <%emperordread> the min / maxing gets so trivially easy when you complete literally ANY path
[0:23:05] <%AncelDeLambert> I was discouraged by the low number of job types
[0:23:05] <%Blank9> if you're on normal, no resource management needed
[0:23:06] <thetruenicster> ..It Is Not That Easy
[0:23:09] <laserbeaming> Fire Emblem games don't like you min-maxing. I FUCKING HATE THAT
[0:23:14] <%AzureGale> Yeah but one of the DLC characters is voiced by Squid Girl
[0:23:18] <%SirGO0SE> the DLC isnt easy, the main game is
[0:23:27] <%Blank9> I like the dlc
[0:23:27] <monsieurfantastic> eggman looking mighty fine
[0:23:33] <%cvp5127> just make everyone a wyvern lord
[0:23:36] <+Pyroclase> yes, actually
[0:23:36] <%kewlmyc> YUZU
[0:23:37] <djblue_shift> DLC is only worth for the characters
[0:23:40] <coolguyvince> @AzureGale im buyin a switch right now say no more
[0:23:42] <%Zetheos> kinda yeah
[0:23:42] <%DakotaMacDoodle> yeah yuzu
[0:23:42] <%Ynkubus_> Ya
[0:23:43] <marvel877> yes
[0:23:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Iirc it doesn't work well yet.
[0:23:47] <%miguelrod777> dlc is outside the main game
[0:23:48] <%Aeogard> DLC characters and classes are good
[0:23:51] <djblue_shift> does yuzu run three houses well enough now?
[0:23:53] <%Aeogard> LYSITHEA DARK FLIER
[0:23:54] <%Futurecity10> yes, you can straight up play breath on pc
[0:23:54] <+Pyroclase> Someone I know emulated BOTW like a montha fter the switch came out
[0:23:54] <Dr_Angelic> aaa we have returned to egg
[0:23:55] <majindusto> JUST PLAY ON YOUR SWITCH
[0:23:56] <+sargewha> Stream stares at egg
[0:23:56] <laserbeaming> I think the compatibility for the Switch emulator is not great yet
[0:23:57] <spawnzie> Yuzu I believe? ppl use to play smash with Rollback
[0:24:01] <%Blank9> it's good for botw kinda but eh
[0:24:05] <+sargewha> Shirt looks sick tho
[0:24:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> If I want a good PS3 emulator I should spend money right?
[0:24:25] <%AzureGale> My one criticism of Three Houses - why are there gender-locked classes again wtf

[0:25:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> lol
[0:25:45] <%MassConnect> dexterity
[0:25:45] <WanderingYoren> It's probably Pillars, cause when have you played path of exile?

[0:26:31] <%walternatorz> ...
[0:26:35] <%Promessa_EX> looks much better
[0:26:36] <%X2Eliah> Idk why you'd do a ranger in Pillars, when all you need to do is put an arquebus on everyone
[0:26:36] <%Zetheos> enjoy baby
[0:26:37] <%Manjove> keep the baby
[0:26:42] <laserbeaming> keep the inventory baby

[0:27:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> YOU'D BE RIGHT
[0:27:37] <%cylish> NONE
[0:27:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NOT THE DLC ITS NOT
[0:27:39] <%Divryne> SWTOR has some of the worst UI I've seen in a game.
[0:27:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I play SWTOR every single day and yeah you're right.
[0:27:44] <+Pyroclase> The best part of the game is that there's 8 different class-specific campaigns
[0:27:51] <thelonechris> Oof
[0:27:54] <+dawsfloss> Can't Old Republic runs addons or no
[0:27:55] <%baka_sugoi> a dead rich guy
[0:27:55] <%walternatorz> not wrong
[0:27:56] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> One day I'm gonna check out SWTOR
[0:27:56] <%cylish> Also you couldnt play it with a controller I think, WAYYYY to many buttons
[0:27:58] <%Manjove> NO controller support, but a full customizable UI
[0:28:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The best part of TOR is everything to do with the writing.
[0:28:07] <GustauveVIII> remember that time that cancer can be cured by alternative medicine?
[0:28:08] <%MoguManda> looking good Pat!!!
[0:28:09] <%miguelrod777> I forget he was dead
[0:28:11] <%TimetodiveLTX> he invented weird CEOs
[0:28:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Divryne Worse than Mass Effect 1?
[0:28:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> Dead fruit man
[0:28:13] <illTemperedSeaBass> I wish they made a Star Wars MMO where all the lightsaber styles were the playable classes/ subclasses.
[0:28:13] <%AzureGale> Fingers crossed
[0:28:18] <%walternatorz> Thanks, Smart Egg Pat.
[0:28:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Post-game daily content is also fun.

[0:29:23] <%Dunmarkh> LUL
[0:29:23] <mike2hands> No simpy of the night anymore
[0:29:25] <marvel877> [CRAZY TALK] activates now
[0:29:26] <%Promessa_EX> eh fog sucks
[0:29:26] <TourettesPlays> Dxun/Onderon is one of the best parts of the game
[0:29:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> Oh no Evil Visas is even hotter
[0:29:29] <djblue_shift> remastered silent hill all over again
[0:29:34] <%crimsonharvest> looks broken the same way the Prince of Persia Sands of TIme fog is broken
[0:29:36] <%Taisuru> Is the GOG version any better?
[0:29:38] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt I missed it, what was the bug that killed the playthrough?
[0:29:42] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> just turn down your brightness and contrast and pretend Kappa
[0:29:45] <%AzureGale> Let's just pretend there is fog everywhere
[0:29:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And even if you get it working it has a high chance of breaking other shit.
[0:29:54] <+vehementvadr> pretend there is fog, use your imagination
[0:29:55] <Broken_Sonex> GOTH PAWG
[0:29:57] <%TheMattman1313> Also GoG
[0:30:05] <%X2Eliah> Wait who is that guy
[0:30:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Hmmm stars.
[0:30:09] <%tinyswampthing> tinyswampthing subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! man i picked a horrible time to gpu shop. on the plus side i got a psu to replace the $40 one ive had for years now
[0:30:12] <%Promessa_EX> like im used to emulating games where the skybox turns black
[0:30:12] <TourettesPlays> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper Disciple
[0:30:17] <%TimetodiveLTX> t i n y j e d i
[0:30:18] <+gustavozxd> I HATE when games have a bunch of versions and there isn't a definitive best one
[0:30:25] <Broken_Sonex> Ugh...this guy
[0:30:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> SHOULD'VE TALKED TO DISCIPLE.
[0:30:28] <%X2Eliah> *That* is the disciple?
[0:30:30] <akman14> tiny jedi? So pat.
[0:30:35] <%Undenizen> drink
[0:30:36] <%dekkitout> Echo- drink
[0:30:43] <%X2Eliah> O've watched like 7 kotor playthroughs,never seen him xD
[0:30:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ECHO
[0:30:52] <%Pigg1yJuffs> We wanna keep going with Woolie's echo drinking game?
[0:30:53] <@commanderclaw> Disciple has an interesting core concern but he's boring. I blame the VA direction
[0:31:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt So since you're never going to do Disciple's conversations, he was YOUR disciple.
[0:31:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> @X2Eliah Yes this is why i never play a female exile even though it's Canon. I refuse to let this fuccboi onto my shipp
[0:31:08] <%Daxalog> This guy has a permanent ": D" face.
[0:31:09] <+gustavozxd> little Jedi
[0:31:09] <TourettesPlays> Compare Disciples tiny shoulder pads to Dash Rendar's chad supreme shoulder pads
[0:31:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He was supposed to be your padawan but you abandoned him to go to war.
[0:31:15] <%AzureGale> Might makes right
[0:31:17] <+projectmanatees> kriea PridePog
[0:31:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> KREIA SUS

[0:31:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> VENT
[0:31:22] <@commanderclaw> "I will kill the galaxy to prove I'm right"
[0:31:23] <%Promessa_EX> he said the thing
[0:31:26] <%dekkitout> What a giga-Chad-Karen, Kreia
[0:31:28] <%Bailey__gaming> egg!
[0:31:40] <%AzureGale> JEDI MIND WIPE GOGOGOG
[0:31:40] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I thought he quit
[0:31:51] <%Bailey__gaming> @PatStaresAt In solidarity with you i also became as Egg today
[0:32:03] <%SirFancySwank> Kreia doesnt doesnt like Tier 3 subs
[0:32:05] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> kreia I'm starting to think you're just making shit up as we go
[0:32:07] <%JobbedBone> plot convenient force powers D:
[0:32:12] <Brothermanhyll> where's mastercard
[0:32:12] <%MidnightBurst12> she old and angry
[0:32:12] <%dekkitout> Imma keep that in mind for a certain show I'm watching
[0:32:19] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> LUL
[0:32:19] <illTemperedSeaBass> I played Light on my playthroughs of this game. I thought Kreia in general approved of the "evil" choices. Is she just a cold-hearted pragmatist?
[0:32:27] <Broken_Sonex> Old lady yells at force cloud @PatStaresAt
[0:32:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Disciple quit after you left. Because he came to the conclusion that if someone he believed in SO much could disagree with the Jedi and still seem so righteous, the jedi must be flawed.
[0:32:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He lost faith because of you.
[0:32:38] <%Taisuru> CHEATS
[0:32:42] <%FacetiousAF> oh right Egg Pat
[0:32:43] <%Zetheos> 0 T3?
[0:32:44] <%Undenizen> ATTON LOVES MURDER
[0:32:47] <%dekkitout> @illTemperedSeaBass Lil bit, but there's more to it
[0:32:59] <%JobbedBone> the spin button makes this game
[0:32:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Disciple is the main source of backstory for the exile.
[0:33:00] <%Zetheos> best feature in this whole game
[0:33:02] <Djinnazz> @illTemperedSeaBass doesn't like when you use the forsse to do the evil stuff.
[0:33:03] <%Daxalog> Dosnt getting to 100 or 0 trigger any form of scene?
[0:33:11] <+lupus_man> Swotr is the only Star Wars game where playing a dark sided Jedi knight is not only valid but characters in game will talk about It how it‚Äôs weird you even serve the Jedi
[0:33:18] <%snow_bush> Yeah but naked training time.
[0:33:20] <laserbeaming> Disciple is way more important to the Story?
[0:33:20] <TourettesPlays> Handmaiden is naked most of the time too
[0:33:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt It's canon that the exile hung out with Disciple AND Handmaiden. No idea why the game is like this.
[0:33:26] <%dekkitout> Snow bunny needs her room
[0:33:27] <%NopeBadguy> the cargo hold
[0:33:33] <@commanderclaw> Pat, 2004 means no bisexuality
[0:33:34] <%AzureGale> P much
[0:33:34] <thewhiterice92> Have you been able to make the party into Jedi?
[0:33:36] <%Manjove> there is a mod for that
[0:33:39] <Zantetzuken> there was no time
[0:33:41] <%Taisuru> WHAT
[0:33:44] <%asylumkon> big part of handmaiden is how much they want that dick
[0:33:45] <%Daxalog> Bioware also made Jade Empire. Is it anywhere as good as this?
[0:33:47] <%fat_burtreynolds> Dude, pat, they already ruined the Re4 remake
[0:33:49] <LVL1_Scumbag> unga bunga
[0:33:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @laserbeaming I don't know about that, Handmaiden has a lot to do with Atris.
[0:33:58] <@commanderclaw> @Daxalog It's okay, but not great
[0:34:10] <%Daxalog> aww
[0:34:15] <TourettesPlays> If you use that mod, does Disciple still call the male exile "her"?
[0:34:18] <%dekkitout> You will help me calm my tits, Disciple!
[0:34:21] <%JobbedBone> why does the dark side give you meth face tho
[0:34:26] <%AzureGale> HOW DO I MEDITATE FOR FISH
[0:34:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Oh NOW he does it.
[0:34:37] <@commanderclaw> Dude has a crush on his senpai
[0:34:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This is the single most important conversation Disciple gets.
[0:34:46] <%X2Eliah> Is he actually your biological brother?
[0:35:07] <%dekkitout> You want dark siders, cause that's how you get dark siders
[0:35:07] <%SirGO0SE> looks like Karen has bigger booba for some reason
[0:35:09] <%JobbedBone> LUL the robot
[0:35:12] <%X2Eliah> wrooooooooom

[0:35:26] <derap41> Boob Plate for days
[0:35:32] <Broken_Sonex> @daxalog You can have a threeway relationship in that game.
[0:35:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Ms. Surik lookin pretty fine.
[0:35:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The problem with The Exile is that she's much older than they made her model look
[0:35:37] <@commanderclaw> Vrook is the worst and the origin of everything wrong in Kotor
[0:36:02] <%Undenizen> Jesus Karen looks awful
[0:36:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> Meanwhile they let Revan back into the Jedi when he's like fucking 40
[0:36:06] <Jonny_Uppercut> WTF!? Pat's hair! It's gone ayaS
[0:36:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @BallerSwagBro9k Nah Jedi though. It's canon that she doesn't age after the mandalorian wars.
[0:36:11] <WanderingYoren> Is Pat's character Darth Alphys?
[0:36:12] <%X2Eliah> wroooooooooom
[0:36:16] <%JobbedBone> I want to play oblivion again but I don't know what mod pack to try
[0:36:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @BallerSwagBro9k For reasons related to the plot she doesn't age a day after Malachor V.
[0:36:26] <%dekkitout> She feels great, and that's all that matters
[0:36:28] <akman14> Queeen Karen
[0:36:30] <+gustavozxd> I like Vrook cause he's more believable than the entire council in the prequels
[0:36:38] <%SirGO0SE> yeah those booba are poppin

[0:38:54] <%Promessa_EX> From my point of view, it's the Jedi who are evil

[0:55:27] <alextrebeken> its like 40k space marines, average people hear they exist but will never see one

[0:55:39] <+gustavozxd> how can people not believe in the force when the prequels are barely a few decades prior
[0:55:39] <olm46> The lightsaber is being carried by see-through strings!
[0:55:43] <+Pyroclase> The "sad ancient religion" line made a lot more sense before the prequels
[0:55:44] <+vehementvadr> perhaps force denial is like anti vaccine people

[0:55:47] <%Promessa_EX> well most of the force users are like dead
[0:55:52] <Djinnazz> Well in the movies most if not all of them have been dead for like a decade, most ppl would never see one.
[0:55:53] <%AkronymCLT> That guy has the least excuse of all
[0:55:53] <%dekkitout> If no one believes/observes the force, no one can see how obviously evil their bosses are

[0:56:23] <%AncelDeLambert> @gustavozxd well, remember a few things: most people never met Jedi face to face, and the war for the Empire only began in truth once the Jedi were all DEAD

[1:02:58] <+gustavozxd> this game seems to have several OP builds
[1:02:59] <GustauveVIII> the game pretty much just makes everything you do possibly get overpowered depending on certain conditions
[1:03:01] <%Undenizen> use your big words, pat
[1:03:01] <%asylumkon> marauder with heavy armor is really strong

[1:05:02] <%AncelDeLambert> but Pat don't you want to meet Drit'zz?
[1:05:05] <BurdRightsActivist> My minndd
[1:05:08] <danielm427> NWN 2 is the best
[1:05:10] <+gustavozxd> there's a bunch of cool voices to choose for the proag
[1:05:14] <ape_hawk> what about Tyranny and the spellcrafting there?
[1:05:16] <+zacyzacy> this game has great menu sounds
[1:05:25] <GustauveVIII> i hated NVN2 because the only viable class that i saw in there was sorcerer
[1:05:25] <%crimsonharvest> oh they're fucking brutal on the interface
[1:05:27] <%logoth_> The Deus Ex 1 of CRPGs
[1:05:33] <+Shockrates20XX> You were trying to play with a controller, weren't you?
[1:05:36] <danielm427> it conntrols good

[1:05:47] <Meekest> He looked like a zombie
[1:05:48] <%Manjove> holy shit someone here mentioned the best RPG ever Tyranny and i am happy
[1:05:49] <+gustavozxd> he looks amazing
[1:05:49] <%dekkitout> Atton- ya look... well...
[1:05:50] <ape_hawk> atton, did you lose some weight?
[1:05:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh shit we back at it again
[1:06:00] <%Dunmarkh> because he loves murder
[1:06:01] <%crimsonharvest> NWN2 had Warlock though, which made up for the game being kind of shit
[1:06:01] <BurdRightsActivist> Oh my gawd! What's wrong with your faaaaceee?
[1:06:02] <Armadageddon> any mods to make the ui for Neverwinter nit shit?
[1:06:05] <chancho4tierra> the quality of the story of nwn 1 is astonishing
[1:06:06] <%Pappajimbo> he got that force std
[1:06:13] <%SirGO0SE> nice of Atton to take a break from shooting up mushrooms to give you an update
[1:06:25] <%crimsonharvest> Deekin best boy of all boys
[1:06:28] <%JobbedBone> its a alien
[1:06:28] <%Dunmarkh> cheetah bird lizard?
[1:06:31] <ape_hawk> its dead, thats what it is

[1:06:36] <Broken_Sonex> You‚Äôre killing it Atton, loving the new look
[1:06:55] <%Breaknoon> did you shave? Looks good
[1:06:56] <%AncelDeLambert> I think this level might be my least favorite, after Malachor. Hall Wuggin' is a pain in the ass here
[1:07:09] <%X2Eliah> Jesus the ingame text is tiny.
[1:07:15] <%crimsonharvest> It's a shame for me in the other direction because while the KOTOR games are far more playable than NWN, i fuckin hate star wars a setting its so pointless
[1:08:03] <%logoth_> Is this the zapping system?
[1:08:14] <%AncelDeLambert> take THAT, nature
[1:08:18] <%SirGO0SE> i was like 9 when I got NWN and i couldnt figure out how to get past the tutorial area LUL
[1:08:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah this is my favorite planet.
[1:08:31] <%AncelDeLambert> nope, this jungle kinda sucks
[1:08:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Or pair of planets.
[1:08:36] <faithless_zealot> Deathly jngle filled w/ Mandalorians! love it
[1:08:38] <%logoth_> Mother nature started the battle for survival, and now she wants to quit because she's losing
[1:09:00] <%AncelDeLambert> this moon is great once you get to the Mandos, but out here it sucks ass
[1:09:05] <%Breaknoon> big RE8 lady is big
[1:09:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ehhh depends.
[1:09:10] <Sapphire_Breeze> more crystals = more stats
[1:09:13] <%cylish> 2 is better cuz twice as many upgrades
[1:09:13] <%SGrim> psaBig
[1:09:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Two lightsabers let you have 4 of the best upgrades though.
[1:09:15] <Jolly_Adventurer> Do combo or big number
[1:09:15] <+Pyroclase> Why are lightsaber claymores not a thing
[1:09:16] <%Dunmarkh> should have gone twinblade
[1:09:19] <%AncelDeLambert> depends on how you build
[1:09:19] <%JobbedBone> why not a lightsaber shaped like a sphere
[1:09:21] <%crimsonharvest> Game too easy to matter which one is better
[1:09:22] <+gustavozxd> I hate dual lightsabers it looks dumb but that's a different argument
[1:09:23] <%Manjove> two lightsabers means twice as many slots
[1:09:23] <$RealThiele> one big hit in 3.0 dnd is best
[1:09:24] <%SirGO0SE> theres a lot of good upgrades tho
[1:09:25] <%Futurecity10> But you can put the more upgrades on two
[1:09:26] <+canseesea> you get stat upgrades from the best crystals, having more slots is more betterer
[1:09:27] <%NopeBadguy> 2 for melee, one for casters
[1:09:27] <%X2Eliah> two sets of upgrades means mlore passive stat boosts
[1:09:30] <WanderingYoren> 12 slots vs 6 slots
[1:09:32] <%shieldecho> !uptime
[1:09:33] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 9m.
[1:09:41] <olm46> Is it better to have two regular RE8 ladies or one big RE8 lady? You tell me.
[1:09:44] <%Daxalog> More chances to on hit stun
[1:09:51] <LVL1_Scumbag> robots are cool
[1:09:52] <%SirGO0SE> you kil gud
[1:09:55] <%MassConnect> lightsabers are inefficient, you only attack one target at a time
[1:09:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> 2 is the minmax choice but this game is easy so any are viable.
[1:09:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> 2 lightsabers means you can be a special snowflake like fuckin Kirito with your TWO SWORDDDSSS
[1:10:11] <+canseesea> @olm46 pat has a racial resistance against tall lady charisma boost
[1:10:13] <+OnwardEch0> beater jedi

[1:10:21] <%AncelDeLambert> increase power of Just Talk, equip stick
[1:10:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Also Kavar dual-wields and he was your sensei.
[1:10:27] <%ChungusQuest> *gasp* The Black Lightsaberman
[1:10:33] <+gustavozxd> having 2 swords is always lame always forever
[1:10:55] <+gustavozxd> IT'S LAME
[1:10:57] <+Pyroclase> person in chat, I disagree with you
[1:10:58] <%dekkitout> Having THREE SWORDS tho...
[1:11:01] <LVL1_Scumbag> Only if you have 2 years worth of gloppy semen
[1:11:03] <+Shockrates20XX> two swords makes you look like a tryhard
[1:11:03] <+OnwardEch0> two sword vrrgin vs. chad sword and board
[1:11:06] <+Goliz> It's not though
[1:11:06] <%JobbedBone> pat are you watching SAO: Alicization?
[1:11:06] <%Breaknoon> wow Jimmy, your mom gave you TWO swords?
[1:11:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> I love two swords, it just becomes kind of lame once EVERYONE has two swords
[1:11:17] <%X2Eliah> One guy in chat has studied the path of the single handed edge too long
[1:11:17] <olm46> It's not always lame, but tends to look like crap because nobody looks up how dual wielding actually works.
[1:11:17] <%crimsonharvest> If you have two swords and you're also an elf you're DOUBLE lame
[1:11:19] <%AzureGale> Hear me out... FOUR SWORDS
[1:11:22] <+gustavozxd> idk why but I always hated anything to do with 2 swords
[1:11:26] <%Pappajimbo> I wonder how good a lightsaber with a Gungun shield would be
[1:11:29] <+vehementvadr> you need one sword for both hands and one for both feet
[1:11:36] <%dekkitout> Sword and board says "I need to block"- fkn coward
[1:11:39] <+OnwardEch0> legolas is super cool though ;_;
[1:11:42] <%Breaknoon> Vishnu with like 4 swords and two guns
[1:11:43] <AMUSERNAME> Sword Primary hand, pistol secondary hand is the GOAT. The Sword Saint Special
[1:11:44] <%AzureGale> What if you used a sword and a gun
[1:11:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> @olm46 How does it work? I've heard at least a dozen different takes on it
[1:11:51] <AdmiralButtloaf> Is duel bladed lightsaber too inaccurate to be viable?
[1:11:52] <%SirGO0SE> @GarbageQueenEllie hmm so we have to use our 2 swords to cut off 1 arm from everyone...
[1:12:00] <+gustavozxd> @AzureGale that's dumb but cooler
[1:12:02] <%dekkitout> @AzureGale What if the sword and gun were as one
[1:12:04] <%MassConnect> what if you had some kind of a gunblade
[1:12:05] <%JobbedBone> HK is an honorary dog
[1:12:23] <Broken_Sonex> Two swords my be better but i like my single blade.
[1:12:24] <%AzureGale> What about... TWO GUNBLADES
[1:12:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> omg Atton looks like a goddamn Vampire
[1:12:29] <%X2Eliah> Wait why does atton look like a goth
[1:12:29] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Yeah but what about a Claymore Lightsaber
[1:12:41] <+swamp_roo> hey dad
[1:12:41] <danielm427> how could ypu forget that face
[1:12:54] <+gustavozxd> usually I never see dual sword characters doing cool moves, they just swing randomly
[1:12:55] <%JobbedBone> what about a shakeweight lightsaber
[1:12:57] <olm46> @GarbageQueenEllie Usually amounts to an unusual stance, arms spread wide and such, but there are likely different workable ways of doing it. It tends to involve logical use of both of your damn weapons.
[1:12:59] <%dekkitout> There are lightsabers with denser blades
[1:12:59] <%SirGO0SE> Atton was shooting up mushrooms
[1:13:01] <+AzureGale> What about a blaster that shoots lightsabers
[1:13:12] <illTemperedSeaBass> What about a lightsaber attached to a headband so you can headbutt-saber-murder people?
[1:13:19] <AMUSERNAME> "Padawan, why have you constructed a LightZweihander?"
[1:13:39] <%AzureGale> Sharks with frickin' lightsabers taped to their heads
[1:13:40] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Give me a lightsaber as thick as Guts sword
[1:13:44] <LVL1_Scumbag> I'm cool, really!
[1:13:45] <%SirGO0SE> what a nice guy trying to kill you :)
[1:13:47] <%X2Eliah> Sooo LightZweihander is literally what kylo ren had.
[1:13:49] <Dragovus> SMELLS LIKE BITCH IN THIS JUNGLE!
[1:13:54] <+Pyroclase> Educated, not eradicated
[1:13:55] <Broken_Sonex> What about the stupid fucking lightsaber POWER ARMOUR?!
[1:13:55] <%Breaknoon> @DakotaMacDoodle THIS
[1:13:56] <%JobbedBone> what about a ball lightsaber you move around with the force
[1:13:58] <Sapphire_Breeze> 2 turns
[1:14:04] <ape_hawk> i give them 6 seconds
[1:14:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> @olm46 Define "logical". Are we talking block one hand attack other, or one blade to swing on each side?
[1:14:26] <%UvBenServed> So then I started Zappin
[1:14:32] <%ChungusQuest> I always thought the coolest would be warheads with lightsaber tips as the ultimate armor=piercing munition
[1:14:34] <%SirGO0SE> using blasters, these guys clearly didnt talk to HK
[1:14:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> @JobbedBone Duuuuude like Go-Go KillBill lightsaber mode???
[1:14:41] <+DappercatEsquire> you WILL be zapped
[1:14:42] <%psidefx> barely 10-12 seconds
[1:14:46] <%MrPedrovsky> Hey Chat! Just Woke up! What did i miss?? <3 <3 <3 <3
[1:14:52] <%AzureGale> What if the Death Star just fired a giant fucking lightsaber
[1:14:53] <%MassConnect> I wish there was a force pull so you could maximize AoE
[1:15:02] <+gustavozxd> what about lightsaber helicopter
[1:15:09] <%dekkitout> Just gimme that lightsaber ren had but make that hilt into a polearm- I want a damn lightsaber-cross spear
[1:15:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Dual-wielding swords IRL doesn't work, but lightsabers can adjust their length with a knob so you could easily adjust them to be an appropriate length for dual-wielding.
[1:15:24] <%anticrust> @MrPedrovsky he fix game
[1:15:27] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Star wars is already stupid space fantasy just go nuts with the lightsabers fuck it I want a game that lets me use a lightsaber whip
[1:15:30] <Dragovus> And Guardians get Force Jump
[1:15:31] <%ChungusQuest> Or miniature lightsaber tech on the knuckles of a power gauntlet
[1:15:32] <Clundy> Lightsaber cross Tekken
[1:15:36] <GustauveVIII> i dont actually remember getting cc'd in this game except for paragus
[1:15:50] <%AncelDeLambert> force jump is worth cheating in every damn time
[1:15:53] <illTemperedSeaBass> The thought of the Death Star igniting a lightsaber, then just spinning in place to cut the planet in half is absolutely hilarious.
[1:15:53] <%AncelDeLambert> NO SHUT UP THO
[1:15:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> Love Force Jump, but that shit can get you killed
[1:16:04] <%dekkitout> @DakotaMacDoodle All these things and more existed in Legends canon
[1:16:11] <Broken_Sonex> @DakotaMacDoodle I want a lightsaber gun. It shoots lightsabers
[1:16:13] <+gustavozxd> @Too_Much_Nukie I usually just think of "looks cool or don't" and usually dual sword characters just swing the swords randomly
[1:16:21] <%MrPedrovsky> Any dank shit i missed pre-game portion??

[1:16:54] <%SirGO0SE> no that npc just looked just like Fanny
[1:16:56] <%MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat Good to see you return to egg psaCanada
[1:16:56] <saraizarai> Character model
[1:17:03] <%asylumkon> comboing force jump with sneak attack is ridiculous in these games
[1:17:04] <RaidenRising> oh look woolie
[1:17:05] <%DakotaMacDoodle> @dekkitout I know but I'd really like to use them
[1:17:06] <Broken_Sonex> FANNY PACK
[1:17:17] <+Solutha> That guy shares Fannys model
[1:17:25] <olm46> @GarbageQueenEllie Mainly don't just not use one of your weapons, or do that silly 'block one sword with two' thing. Also, using both swords to attack as quickly as you would with one. Swinging both at once may be troublesome, but this is just silly.
[1:17:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There is a way it's a bit difficult to explain in text.
[1:17:31] <%MassConnect> you have blue arrow
[1:17:38] <%cylish> Put her on "Jedi Support" for her AI and she should be doing it regularly
[1:17:42] <GustauveVIII> arent the bonuses to max dark side worse than the max to light side?
[1:17:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You have to go to the dialogue menu.
[1:17:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That shows all combat logs.
[1:17:50] <ape_hawk> the blue arrow means youre an air nomad
[1:17:53] <+gustavozxd> Dante with Agni and Rudra is cool tho
[1:18:01] <%MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat COMBAT LOGS

[1:18:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah it's awkward.

[1:18:42] <AMUSERNAME> "EFFECTS"
[1:18:43] <%dekkitout> psaSkelmo
[1:18:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> Effects is what you want.
[1:18:45] <Broken_Sonex> I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT SCREEN
[1:18:55] <+gustavozxd> the Jedi fallen order sword is my fav though because it's all in one
[1:18:59] <Clundy> That is SOME MATH
[1:19:00] <%AdamElJefe> Oh snap, KOTOR working now?
[1:19:11] <AdmiralButtloaf> but...
[1:19:12] <illTemperedSeaBass> @olm46 there's "kind of" a thing to having to block one sword with two, if your opponent is swinging with both hands on that one blade.
[1:19:16] <AdmiralButtloaf> weapon systems
[1:19:18] <%emperordread> "Alarmed Embarasment" is my spirit animal
[1:19:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> Pat zaps side-saddle
[1:19:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @gustavozxd It's just worse-Senya's lightsaber. Because hers also becomes a pike/spear.
[1:19:33] <%Broand> Didn't they have the same dialogue back on dantooine
[1:19:36] <%JobbedBone> its too good NOT to do
[1:19:37] <LVL1_Scumbag> well then
[1:19:39] <AdmiralButtloaf> cant use gun...uses gun

[1:19:50] <+gustavozxd> @Too_Much_Nukie well shit LUL
[1:20:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If you like the Fallen Order lightsaber, google Senya Tirall Lightsaber.
[1:20:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> All done
[1:20:36] <+gustavozxd> yeah I'm looking
[1:20:38] <%BYAKURENLOVER763> good lp everybody
[1:20:46] <olm46> @illTemperedSeaBass Yes, but half the time I see it, the dual-wielder can just avoid it rather than block. Or take the opportunity to stab with one sword while deflecting with the other.
[1:20:47] <illTemperedSeaBass> Gg, no re.
[1:20:48] <%Agami23> living bugzaper
[1:20:57] <%JobbedBone> is it MP efficient though

[1:21:57] <ape_hawk> paige, stop sneezing, you dumb mustard goblin
[1:22:01] <illTemperedSeaBass> @olm46 Those examples definitely play into the "kind of" part. If the duel-wielder gets caught off guard it's not unreasonable, but they do it by choice, which is absolutely a problem.
[1:22:01] <%AncelDeLambert> ... okay
[1:22:01] <%MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat You are not playing divinity to be going around licking corpses
[1:22:05] <%ChungusQuest> "direct disarm"

[1:26:12] <Teras_ode> He's Mandalore, leader of Mandalorians coming from the planet mandalore

[1:36:15] <Broken_Sonex> @illTemperedSeaBass Well then, it wouldn't be a honourable warrior culture, then would it?
[1:36:19] <dandy_thimble> Patlighting
[1:36:32] <MucousMembrain> Youre the one that said it wrong nerd
[1:36:36] <Gruhunchously> Oh hey, Mandos
[1:36:47] <%SirGO0SE> i like that train of logic
[1:37:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHY ARE ALL MANDOS AUSTRALIAN?
[1:37:17] <AdmiralButtloaf> your relay is on fire bro
[1:37:25] <Gruhunchously> @BallerSwagBro9k Because Jango Fett
[1:37:27] <Broken_Sonex> @BallerSwagBro9k BECAUSE FUCK YOU
[1:37:34] <HeroToxiko> Mandolorians are just humans, the clones were clones of a guy who was not himself a mandolorian because they gave him the armor as payment.
[1:37:43] <%dekkitout> @BallerSwagBro9k Put Aussies in space- what would you get?
[1:37:45] <+canseesea> I tried shooting this computer so many times you wouldn't believe it
[1:37:48] <ancrest_tant> If you think about it, Australians are basically Mandolorians
[1:37:48] <illTemperedSeaBass> @Broken_Sonex Not necessarily. "We have rules of conduct and value death in combat" is different from "I would rather die than accept medical attention, for my blood being drawn outside of combat is DISHONORABLE!" Yet both are honorable warriors.
[1:37:50] <Broken_Sonex> @BallerSwagBro9k Australian here.
[1:37:55] <%Puhff> C R I KE Y
[1:37:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BallerSwagBro9k because its basically space australia
[1:38:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I guess surviving in Australia does make you a badass LUL
[1:38:11] <Gruhunchously> Mandalorians is what you get when you put Aussies in space
[1:38:33] <HeroToxiko> @BallerSwagBro9k not australian, kiwi
[1:38:33] <MucousMembrain> Oi Oi Oi
[1:38:40] <%Puhff> I hope one of them talk about their knives
[1:38:42] <AdmiralButtloaf> Space Australia
[1:38:44] <%Pappajimbo> I imagine this is how klingons work. "This janitors mop has No Honour!!!!"
[1:38:44] <HeroToxiko> they're new zealanders
[1:38:51] <Broken_Sonex> @illTemperedSeaBass Give me an example of the former.
[1:38:52] <%AzureGale> That was easy
[1:38:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> Just slap some Omnigel on it
[1:38:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Pappajimbo LUK
[1:39:08] <+vicar_anat> The force works in mysterious ways...
[1:39:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Pappajimbo LUL
[1:39:18] <%Undenizen> it's almost like the Mandolorians aren't very good at anything!
[1:39:21] <+Pyroclase> I think STO has a scene where you can talk to a Klingon farmer and he's just like "no our society barely works"
[1:39:36] <Broken_Sonex> @BallerSwagBro9k You have no fucking idea, man
[1:39:36] <%dekkitout> Running around at the speed of indignance
[1:39:55] <Broken_Sonex> It's horrible over here
[1:40:23] <%dekkitout> Even the trees out in the bush try to kill people
[1:40:24] <illTemperedSeaBass> @Broken_Sonex The Swiss during the middle-ages. They had a strong military-culture, and were both highly sought after, and valued as some of the best-disciplined, loyal, and honorable mercenaries of the time period.
[1:40:37] <Gruhunchously> It's that ship that Bastilla had in KOTOR 1, when she was evil.
[1:40:39] <AdmiralButtloaf> Karens don't hate managers. They hate regular employees, but tolerate managers because they know they will give them whatever they want.
[1:40:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @illTemperedSeaBass THE SWISS?! LUL WOW
[1:40:49] <illTemperedSeaBass> They saved the Pope against hopeless odds on a handful of occasions.

[1:41:29] <%cylish> Atton gets one
[1:41:30] <ape_hawk> FOR MANDALORE!
[1:41:30] <%Undenizen> HK does one

[1:41:36] <%MassConnect> Atton, Mira, HK
[1:41:38] <Gruhunchously> Debra
[1:41:38] <illTemperedSeaBass> @BallerSwagBro9k So there's this thing called "reading the whole comment." The Swiss now are unlike the Swiss of hundreds of years ago.
[1:41:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Almost all of the them
[1:41:40] <Broken_Sonex> @illTemperedSeaBass Never thought the Swiss had it in em

[1:42:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @illTemperedSeaBass ? No i read it
[1:42:09] <%AzureGale> Are the Mandalorians basically Klingons
[1:42:15] <+canseesea> When we go too long without a murder we all jump on the pile
[1:42:25] <%psidefx> no more question
[1:42:29] <%Undenizen> he's gotta do a jowel shake
[1:42:35] <illTemperedSeaBass> @BallerSwagBro9k Then what was the caps-locked response about?
[1:43:04] <%za7az> LUL
[1:43:06] <%Undenizen> what's honorable about arbitrary restrictions?
[1:43:07] <Gruhunchously> What did he do?
[1:43:07] <Broken_Sonex> @Dragovus Which is fine, but also unfortunate since she's good eyecandy

[1:46:11] <Broken_Sonex> @illTemperedSeaBass Cesaro i think is his name
[1:46:17] <Gruhunchously> I mean, fist fighting is probably the most ancient way of warfare

[1:48:05] <WanderingYoren> Jarl Balgruuf, Mandalorian
[1:48:05] <illTemperedSeaBass> @Undenizen This may be an extreme example, but is the Geneva convention a set of "arbitrary restriction?" Is biological warfare honorable?
[1:48:06] <+Cobaltor_252> you didn't win your experience just gave you an unfair advantage!!!
[1:48:08] <Broken_Sonex> @illTemperedSeaBass In the end, aren't we all a little culturally ignorant?

[1:48:52] <Gruhunchously> Consider how rushed the development of this game was, the voice acting is exceptional.
[1:49:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Report to the ship as soon as possible......we'll bang ok?
[1:49:10] <Broken_Sonex> OH MY GOD I NEVER RELISED IT WAS BULGRUF

[1:55:19] <illTemperedSeaBass> Armor change definitely gonna be necessary.
[1:55:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah mines don't work in this instance. Just upgrade your armor against melee
[1:55:20] <Gruhunchously> I guess they planned ahead for that one
[1:55:21] <%AzureGale> The mines betrayed you

[1:55:37] <%psidefx> flurry time?

[1:56:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL#
[1:56:42] <moonmintparadise> Karen is not allowed to use the Power of calling the manager and thus fails in real life hand to hand combat

[1:57:00] <AdmiralButtloaf> send the wizard into unarmed combat
[1:57:06] <+GuilKato> come back later with better gear
[1:57:07] <danielm427> use drugs befor battle
[1:57:10] <Broken_Sonex> Can't you drug up beforehand?
[1:57:16] <moonmintparadise> She is like every karen captured on video. Fearsome, but weak once you put hands on her
[1:57:28] <Gruhunchously> Roll up and watch a some aussie chunk kick a skinny white woman's ass.

[1:57:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> (whisper) workbeeeench...
[1:57:37] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt So the last thing I can think of is have you tried equipping your lightsaber after you accept the fight but BEFORE he turns hostile?
[1:57:50] <dm1nusterran> The battle circle is no place for Honorless scum your save reloads can not save you from the glory of our victories!
[1:57:52] <%SirGO0SE> the sith way is to shoot up all the drugs
[1:58:05] <Broken_Sonex> @moonmintparadise They all think they're hot shit until they actually take them to the manager
[1:58:08] <akman14> FOR MANDALORE
[1:58:11] <lol_red_ranger> do drugs for mandalore
[1:58:13] <dm1nusterran> Al hail Mandalore!

[1:58:30] <%ChungusQuest> "Here to watch?" "HgdebHGGFrolrrRRRRghgh"
[1:58:39] <%Daxalog> I think you can also put your melee shield on
[1:58:44] <%dekkitout> "I want to speak to your manager." *Manager boss healthbar appears*
[1:58:45] <$RealThiele> yeyeye dnd str is king
[1:58:48] <ThePimpGuin> of course not
[1:58:51] <illTemperedSeaBass> These performance-enhancing drugs have NO HONOR!
[1:58:56] <%AgniBrandt> Strength determines your accuracy in D&D, too, unless you're using a dex weapon
[1:58:56] <Gruhunchously> The Mandalorians to thorough screenings.
[1:59:01] <%SirGO0SE> if your muscles are big enough, how could they possibly miss?
[1:59:02] <rawrmeowxd> OMG HAIR CUT
[1:59:02] <%cylish> Go into the pause menu to use healing
[1:59:04] <GustauveVIII> did they custom patch the game to fix this?
[1:59:06] <%cylish> in the fight
[1:59:07] <dm1nusterran> A real warrior fights only with his intuition, his strength and his honor.
[1:59:08] <%Teintstein> we only said you could take drugs, not that they'd work
[1:59:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'd recommend str underlay and upgrades against melee damage for your suit
[1:59:12] <%AzureGale> I guess you will have to fight another day
[1:59:14] <rawrmeowxd> YOOOOOOOOOO LOOKIN SMOOTH
[1:59:14] <Gruhunchously> Because he poopoo?
[1:59:15] <%cylish> it shouldnt count against you
[1:59:21] <LVL1_Scumbag> You could say he's pooped
[1:59:21] <+GuilKato> Zangief is empty now - he wants to be full of food
[1:59:27] <%psidefx> ye pause menu heal is still viable
[1:59:35] <$RealThiele> @AgniBrandt in 3.0 its worse weapon finesse only works on one weapon type
[1:59:36] <Clundy> Tired from releasing S T E N C H
[1:59:37] <rawrmeowxd> PUPPER
[1:59:39] <Gruhunchously> It's possible to use the workbench to mod your armor to jack your strength up.
[1:59:46] <%augusta_wind> i swear that dog gets bigger every time i see him
[2:00:04] <dm1nusterran> Stink Boi :)
[2:00:05] <%AgniBrandt> @RealThiele Oof. I'm glad 5e doesn't do that, Dex characters are my favorite.

[2:00:21] <%Pigg1yJuffs> He's such a big fat baby, I swear.
[2:00:21] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Could you try changing your Jedi fighting style and using a melee shield before the fight?
[2:00:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> gief is bigger than Pat
[2:00:26] <rawrmeowxd> PogChamp
[2:00:27] <Broken_Sonex> The problem is Karen is using her arms. Use your thicc legs like Chun-Li.
[2:00:35] <$RealThiele> yea 3.0 dex builds were trash. str you just get massive to hit and dmg, you take power attack and 2h to just destroy enemies
[2:00:53] <Clundy> I still can‚Äôt believe Gief was as small as he was
[2:00:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Soon Gief shall be large enough to serve as Ser Patron's steed
[2:01:02] <rawrmeowxd> Yo the new cut makes you look a lot younger actually lokl
[2:01:03] <Clundy> And now he big chinked
[2:01:04] <rawrmeowxd> lol
[2:01:06] <%Daxalog> !?
[2:01:09] <Clundy> Chonker‚Äô
[2:01:11] <Gruhunchously> I don't think lightsaber stances effect melee combat
[2:01:11] <Clundy> Wtf
[2:01:16] <%Daxalog> Gonna Gonna splam
[2:01:17] <%AzureGale> Splam

[2:01:23] <GustauveVIII> lol wow i think they fixed this
[2:01:24] <$RealThiele> Splam
[2:01:25] <dm1nusterran> 5e is fun to play especially for newer players but if you want challenging combats in a fantasy setting it's gotta be PF2e or like Gurps lol.
[2:01:25] <ItsJustThatSimp_le> splurry if you will
[2:01:29] <@commanderclaw> @PatStaresAt You can cheat this by placing mines before the fight I think
[2:01:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> woooorkbeeeench.

[2:01:41] <@commanderclaw> Damn

[2:01:57] <RetributionP> pat failed the LP
[2:01:57] <%SirGO0SE> yeah workbench might help
[2:01:59] <illTemperedSeaBass> @PatStaresAt Try upgrading the armor at a workbench. Strength-enhancing upgrades and melee shit.
[2:02:01] <%Daxalog> Steam version probably patched out all the cheat- i mean cool tech
[2:02:04] <@commanderclaw> But exploits are half the fun of Kotor 2!
[2:02:04] <dm1nusterran> The battle circle is not your place PAtrick, but there are other uses warriors might have for delicious sweet bois.
[2:02:04] <olaksi> time to grind
[2:02:05] <$RealThiele> get more str and come back later

[2:03:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> B/c they hate videogames, @PatStaresAt
[2:03:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He tells you about hunting a Zakegg.

[2:04:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Not this one.
[2:04:47] <$RealThiele> a true mandolorian
[2:04:53] <Gruhunchously> In Woolie's LP this was basically 'YOU STOLE MY HONROR' 'I have no idea who you are'.
[2:04:58] <dm1nusterran> Legit does not give a fuck you punked some punk in front of him LUL
[2:04:59] <+Pyroclase> I wish betrayals in RPGs actually felt upsetting and not "lol you idiot"

[2:05:04] <%AzureGale> I like how this guy didn't give a fuck
[2:05:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's SUPER easy to miss because he has a generic name.
[2:05:18] <rawrmeowxd> It's cool to see you with lightsabers now
[2:05:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It took me like 3 playthroughs to even notice the guy.
[2:05:31] <rawrmeowxd> I really want to get it now. I only really played the first one

[2:05:54] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt Try talking to him again?
[2:05:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No it was a zakegg hunt, it might've fucked up because Davrel is an optional part of it.
[2:06:05] <olaksi> You really have to wonder why these guy went extinct
[2:06:07] <%dekkitout> @Meekest Woolie tried to roll that, but the gameplay leans towards light/dark

[2:10:14] <%SirGO0SE> wee woo
[2:10:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> I thought you had a big lightsaber.
[2:10:20] <MillaMoks> @PatStaresAt Very ironic indeed. Short man is short on lightsabers Kappa
[2:10:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> So you have a chance to get regular, short, or double.
[2:10:28] <Broken_Sonex> They look normal size on a woman.
[2:10:39] <%SirGO0SE> helicopter gnome F

[2:11:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yup, this is the magic of the dark side.
[2:11:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> I hope someone does a meme of your Palpatine Build soon
[2:11:12] <%SirGO0SE> me too man :( wc3 was the game that got me into game dev and competitive gaming in one swoop
[2:11:12] <lol_red_ranger> yeah they came from behind is a WC3 voice line but its a star wars reference
[2:11:12] <%Ghufufin> space wizards OP
[2:11:17] <rawrmeowxd> Your dick is just too big pat
[2:11:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Force Storm costs like 6 points or something at full dark side.
[2:11:28] <Broken_Sonex> You become SO fucking broken by endgame
[2:11:34] <+Pyroclase> Did you hear they killed the team behind Warfraft 3 reforged entirely?
[2:11:39] <%Alazull> Legends of Runeterra ew
[2:11:48] <Gruhunchously> You can be so broken by the mid game
[2:11:52] <%ChungusQuest> now that was a neat Force trick
[2:11:56] <%PaladinDupre> THIS IS BETTER
[2:11:58] <%JobbedBone> WOW
[2:11:59] <rawrmeowxd> LOL WTF
[2:12:02] <+OnwardEch0> @Broken_Sonex i like that you get so strong, it feels like actual progress

[2:12:11] <rawrmeowxd> We saw lool
[2:12:24] <%dekkitout> Dassa deep ass mana pool
[2:12:25] <%cylish> when crush upgrades make sure to use it on a huminoid enemy. shit is brutal'
[2:12:27] <+spoofcaptain> Force powers are busted yeah lol
[2:12:27] <Gruhunchously> @PaladinDupre It's better until dialogue stars
[2:12:28] <Broken_Sonex> @Broken_Sonex RPG's should do it more often
[2:12:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FINALLY I SEE HP
[2:12:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah and your force regen is godlike.
[2:12:31] <%ChungusQuest> @PaladinDupre better until dialogue gets cut off
[2:12:34] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt No one Kae'ryn deserves all that UNLIMITED POWER!
[2:12:36] <+spoofcaptain> Bro crush is insane
[2:12:47] <%PaladinDupre> he reads the dialogue anyway
[2:12:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NOOOOOOOOOO
[2:12:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Crush is your bonus power for being a Sith Lord.
[2:12:57] <TheTakkster> What is McIchiban?
[2:13:00] <RetributionP> force grope
[2:13:03] <+spoofcaptain> Don't think thats it
[2:13:03] <%PaladinDupre> he cant read the mana bar
[2:13:04] <Gruhunchously> Crush is a special power you get in the endgame
[2:13:06] <%cylish> Crush II has a uniqe animation
[2:13:19] <rawrmeowxd> crush? More like Kush
[2:13:20] <+spoofcaptain> there's a different one
[2:13:20] <Broken_Sonex> Force Dick Twist.

[2:13:24] <tanarath> 'just'
[2:13:24] <RetributionP> it's super strong
[2:13:35] <%Big_Dream> its really good
[2:13:36] <Javi9563> crush is a special power you get in the endgame if you are DS, LS gets force enlightment
[2:13:38] <%cylish> youll see once it upgrades
[2:13:40] <%Big_Dream> just try it
[2:13:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It has a cool animation, that's why people want to see it. Unique animation only starts at rank 2.
[2:13:44] <tanarath> Pat, it's a better Kill
[2:13:45] <%MrPedrovsky> It‚Äôs MEGA STRONG
[2:13:55] <Gallhint> would you rather them keep the 1?

[2:15:29] <tanarath> Spammanle aoe stun
[2:15:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Crush only gets its unique animation at rank 2, against humanoid targets.
[2:15:46] <tanarath> Fuck you pat, it isn't broken at all
[2:15:47] <+vaderxyz1970> Palpatene was even MORE broken
[2:15:48] <%JobbedBone> DPS multiplied by the size of the encounter? Nah its fine Kappaa
[2:15:53] <Gruhunchously> I bet Visas is getting off on this super hard.

[2:49:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I think you can only turn in the quest if you help him get down.
[2:49:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> So dark side doesn't get it.
[2:49:24] <KaitlynnHere> I know you can do it..... I just forgot how
[2:49:32] <KaitlynnHere> Sorrie
[2:49:37] <%SirGO0SE> oh well :)
[2:49:37] <rawrmeowxd> weewoo weewoo
[2:49:37] <@SSaryn> To be fair, you did blow him the fuck up
[2:49:41] <Gruhunchously> oops
[2:49:42] <@SSaryn> Along with his armor.
[2:49:43] <khotgor> I don't understand why you can't get a force abolity that allows you to loot items away from miles away
[2:49:46] <rawrmeowxd> woowoo
[2:49:49] <$Afterman_> not much armor left anyway
[2:50:13] <+gustavozxd> @khotgor you can in prey tho LUL
[2:50:20] <@SoFarFetched> just gather up the dust of his armor,I'm sure its still in "pristine" condition geefPlz
[2:50:31] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt So are you already at maximum influence with HK?
[2:50:34] <rawrmeowxd> Corpse Husband?
[2:50:51] <$Afterman_> oh hey a tiny rajang
[2:51:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Zakkegs are so cute I swear on me mum
[2:51:04] <Gruhunchously> I mean, I'm not surprised
[2:51:08] <%WhereIsWill> that force storm looks busted
[2:51:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[2:51:23] <Gruhunchously> It is busted
[2:51:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I was waiting for it.
[2:51:33] <@SoFarFetched> Don't forget to carve after the fight,Pat.
[2:51:34] <samwantsham> hey pat love the game bruhhh
[2:51:40] <$Afterman_> lucky rolls for the dude
[2:51:49] <%WhereIsWill> welp LUL
[2:51:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Force powers can still work on the Zakkeg but it will always either save or resist them.
[2:51:53] <tanarath> @patstaresat Use plague on resistant enemies
[2:51:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Resisted powers do nothing.
[2:51:59] <%DashXero> Is that the creature that guy was talking about?
[2:52:13] <rawrmeowxd> Commiting mass muppet murder
[2:52:15] <Gruhunchously> Visas just rushes in.
[2:52:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yea sicc Eli on em
[2:52:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You have more cannoks to kill.

[2:53:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Check your quest log, pretty sure you didn't get all the phase pulse parts.
[2:53:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You're supposed to get a lightsaber with the last part.
[2:53:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Weird!
[2:53:20] <Gruhunchously> It's around this point that the moon of Dxun was affected by the ecological disaster known as 'Karen'
[2:53:32] <rawrmeowxd> a "jedi"
[2:53:51] <rawrmeowxd> yea hahaha too bad LUL

[2:54:22] <TourettesPlays> Pat use to skills to craft some shitz
[2:54:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Maybe he gives the lightsaber?
[2:54:50] <Nootyman> Imagine the droid going ‚ï∞(‚úß‚àá‚úß‚ï∞)
[2:55:02] <@SSaryn> Excuse me?
[2:55:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nope. Weird.
[2:55:10] <rawrmeowxd> Are you ok pat? you look like youre in more pain than usual
[2:55:12] <@SSaryn> That was a weird way to say that but ok
[2:55:29] <@SSaryn> Yeah. Cannoks.
[2:55:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I know for sure you get a lightsaber part for killing cannoks, maybe it's only the part and you don't get a full lightsaber for it.
[2:55:41] <Gruhunchously> LUL
[2:56:14] <Gruhunchously> No you get a new lightsaber for sure
[2:56:22] <Gruhunchously> That's not how honor works, Pat
[2:56:32] <%dekkitout> "Back for more?"
[2:56:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat must've missed one then.
