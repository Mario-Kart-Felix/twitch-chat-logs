[0:11:02] <%tortugatime214> Yeah, welcome to Texas time Patrick
[0:11:05] <%saadi90> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[0:11:11] <+Jiggisnipe> yep
[0:11:11] <Blank9> you accidentally were too responsible instead of forgetting it
[0:11:12] <%Fooguwu> genius cumcumbo
[0:11:15] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Depending on where you are it's either Central or Mountain, isn't it? This is beside the point that Pat is making but still.
[0:11:15] <%Garthunox> Yeah woolie did say 11:30
[0:11:17] <marvel877> Woolie's always late for stuff, Pat...
[0:11:19] <hewlettfan96> No doubt
[0:11:21] <+vascillia> JEHUTY
[0:11:23] <+Jiggisnipe> you gotta confirm timezones WOOLIE
[0:11:32] <%kullumanati> BT
[0:11:35] <+vascillia> jehuty is the greatest mech design of all time, fight me
[0:11:37] <%Garthunox> so who won? jehuty right?
[0:11:37] <%valriot> Jehuty is SO FUCKIN BUSTED
[0:11:48] <+eanscrale> Yeah but BT isn't like, a god.
[0:11:51] <%ringabal> Playing the long game, I see
[0:11:51] <ExpressNode> Cuz we were an hour late
[0:11:52] <%scaryboisupreme> yeah BT is cool but Jehuty is...Well it's Jehuty
[0:11:53] <Botman_R> Death Battle killed ScrewAttack
[0:11:56] <terrorengine> who are these people
[0:11:57] <%valriot> LUL
[0:11:58] <%NitronStreams> LUL
[0:11:59] <+Caidezes> LUL
[0:12:00] <%Wrashis> wait YOU PICKED IT?
[0:12:00] <kikoeru_san> Y'all ain't really into the equivalents of their of those mechas
[0:12:01] <Daniel_Is_I> LUL
[0:12:02] <marvel877> The one that FLIES IN SPACE would win.
[0:12:04] <%Wrashis> i thought they did
[0:12:04] <+vascillia> BT vs Jehuty would be approximately 5 seconds long
[0:12:06] <%Garthunox> I've never played ZOE and even I know Jehuty would win
[0:12:06] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> The pettiness
[0:12:07] <%BoxNavy> ohhhh......
[0:12:08] <%abusywizard> THE MOST RELATABLE
[0:12:10] <+PrimalDweeb> Jehuty as in Zone of the Enders?
[0:12:11] <%bread_assassin> Gaara vs Toph still haunts me.
[0:12:15] <%YakumoYomi> Jehuty vs. BT seems like a classic case of "Super Robot vs Real Robot"
[0:12:15] <%MisterRockett> What's the WORST Death Battle to you, Pat?
[0:12:16] <%weissguard> Death Battle is smelly
[0:12:19] <kikoeru_san> Like BT would be an Ingram for a fair fight
[0:12:20] <%weissguard> Big smelly
[0:12:20] <+evbites> true
[0:12:23] <hewlettfan96> Absolutely the most relatable!!
[0:12:26] <+Promessa_EX> that's like the point
[0:12:26] <%feelmyfunk> RT is in such a weird ass spot rn
[0:12:32] <%MisterRockett> You shouldn't be it's just for fun.
[0:12:40] <kikoeru_san> And Jehuty vs Raxephon would be good
[0:12:41] <+vascillia> My fav video they've ever done was Balrog vs T.J. Combo, I've watched it prob 4 times and it's so hype when the COMBO music starts
[0:12:46] <+skyheys> they're usually wrong and jerk off stupid rhetoric fan theories for clicks
[0:12:47] <%ssjklyco> "I'm mad my character didn't win"
[0:12:51] <FutaSnek> SNAKE VS SAM WAS GOOD
[0:12:54] <%grimm_hatter> a LOT of their fights are clearly rigged
[0:12:55] <FutaSnek> ILL DIE ON THAT HILL
[0:12:56] <%YakumoYomi> I used to just watch it for the animation at the end
[0:12:59] <kasteni> Deadliest Warrior
[0:12:59] <hewlettfan96> Death Battle is absolute wank mainly
[0:13:00] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt Have you been playing RE Village off stream? I'm on my third playthough and this game is so good.
[0:13:04] <%MisterRockett> Ben 10 vs Gren Lantern cause a tizzy.
[0:13:04] <%scaryboisupreme> Snake vs Sam was a no brainer
[0:13:04] <+vascillia> TJ COMBOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:13:08] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Sol vs whats his name
[0:13:12] <sauce_boss__> when staning takes over you're real life
[0:13:15] <kikoeru_san> Maybe Jehuty vs Unicorn Gundam
[0:13:15] <communistjugular> nier is good, finally finished it
[0:13:15] <%ringabal> HAH
[0:13:17] <+Promessa_EX> nah goku sucks
[0:13:21] <%MisterRockett> FUCK YOU PAT
[0:13:22] <+skyheys> okay Lex
[0:13:22] <kikoeru_san> That would work
[0:13:22] <marvel877> NO SHIT

[0:13:26] <%kknutson4> And Guts vs Nightmare
[0:13:26] <%Fooguwu> nice disco elysium plugin NERD
[0:13:26] <%ClericOfSparda> Hey Goku
[0:13:27] <+MugenSandan> I can't get into Death Battle for the same reason I can't get into Mortal Kombat, I just can't get into the gratuitous murder
[0:13:28] <%MisterRockett> THAT WAS THE RIGHTEST THEY'D EVER BEEN
[0:13:29] <%scaryboisupreme> Goku SHOULD have won but Superman sucks big fat nuts so of course he won
[0:13:30] <%MelBrooksKA> k
[0:13:32] <%MisterRockett> YOU JUST HATE SUPERMAN
[0:13:32] <+D00msDayDan> i'm just saiyan
[0:13:34] <OkamiDude15> how we doing gang
[0:13:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PAT THAT WAS YEARS AGO
[0:13:35] <Ramasama13> pat what have you done
[0:13:39] <FutaSnek> LITERALLY ANYTHING?
[0:13:41] <Profmcstevie> Goku would never win that fight, but the first death battle was absurd Superman destroyed his home
[0:13:41] <%Garthunox> Remember the Tifa vs Yang one? Guess who won there? Was it the one owned by Rooster Teeth?
[0:13:42] <%valriot> Goku so dumb LUL
[0:13:45] <%weissguard> they also just lie while giving their reasoning. Like super man lifting "infinity by himself", when the image they used clearly shows green lantern and wonder woman as well.
[0:13:45] <kikoeru_san> Goku should gone further beyond
[0:13:47] <%BoxNavy> i hate when pat starts reeling up for a big joke
[0:13:49] <$Ziegsy> ben 10 would beat goku
[0:13:50] <hewlettfan96> Pat it was an eternity ago
[0:13:51] <+gitgouda> I'm fairly early. excitement escalating.
[0:13:52] <FutaSnek> FUCK YOUR RIGHT
[0:13:53] <+skyheys> exactly
[0:13:54] <+vascillia> Goku would lose because he doesn't kill anything, thus losing the death battle before it even began
[0:13:54] <%Dakuu75> yeah... goku is an idiot
[0:13:54] <FutaSnek> AND I HATE IT

[0:14:02] <%ringabal> With how much Toriyama has forgotten, he's turning into Goku
[0:14:03] <Daniel_Is_I> Goku would have Bulma make anti-kryptonite to give to Superman
[0:14:04] <mike2hands> yeah he's that sputid
[0:14:04] <%saadi90> Kryptonite Kamehameha
[0:14:05] <%MisterRockett> Yeah totally
[0:14:07] <+eanscrale> THINK Gohan THINK
[0:14:07] <%thbluewarden> what's good Pat?
[0:14:08] <+D00msDayDan> that saiyan has TOO MUCH HONOR
[0:14:09] <+evbites> he did do that in the ep
[0:14:12] <%NitronStreams> He would move the sun closer to the earth to make super man stronger
[0:14:12] <Ethel9727> "Goku, here's the last kryptonite!" "Thanks Bluma!" *energy blast* "...I worked on that for a month straight."
[0:14:12] <%BoxNavy> Near
[0:14:13] <marvel877> Goku would have given Superman the Dragonballs just to make it a fair fight.
[0:14:13] <hewlettfan96> There’s no clear winner@
[0:14:14] <2DSuperiority> kill all crypto Goku
[0:14:15] <+gitgouda> power comes from the sun itself and is not earned? fair.
[0:14:16] <OkamiDude15> he'd let superman absorb the sun to fight him at his strongest
[0:14:20] <%mister___doctor> Why is Harry on my screen
[0:14:21] <terrorengine> Which goku are we talking about?
[0:14:21] <%arcaderabbit48> How far in to Nier is Pat?

[0:24:10] <Jontman42> it's probably a bit too recent for the Americans at least
[0:24:10] <%spitelite> a lot of americans get butt hurt when you talk about it
[0:24:10] <+JustToWatch> Metal Gear Rising is the greatest political commentary of the modern era
[0:24:12] <vile_brand> what was the line?
[0:24:12] <+eanscrale> They don't call him Sunupper.
[0:24:13] <+evbites> fucking sundowner on the reddit
[0:24:14] <godzookylives> Local man is Fucking Invincible
[0:24:14] <UberKingKai> Shadow of the colossus was used in a movie
[0:24:16] <huskarl_zap> a brick that got thrown down a pit?
[0:24:19] <cardamomo88> thats all kojima
[0:24:19] <%BoxNavy> mgs2 is the scariest game ever made
[0:24:22] <%Mr_Pylon> that's nothing the Running Man book did it first
[0:24:23] <%0rond> to be fair A LOT of media accidently predicted it
[0:24:24] <CSeriesJTYPE> "predicted" is a stretch
[0:24:25] <fluffy_sauce> also know as Indigo Prophecy
[0:24:27] <i_need_sciss0rz> @patstaresat what were your overall thoughts on RE Village?
[0:24:28] <trianglehat> it was konami all along
[0:24:29] <FutaSnek> YEEEEP BIG SHELL FUCKS NY
[0:24:30] <thelonechris> Holy fuck that's an actual line from the game
[0:24:32] <OkamiDude15> kids are cruel jack
[0:24:33] <FutaSnek> CANT SHOW THAT
[0:24:36] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Deus Ex 1 also unintentionally predicted 9/11
[0:24:37] <%Monkeyweed21> Kojima MUST not play 13 Sentinels
[0:24:38] <NeonBleu> oh boy
[0:24:41] <%Fooguwu> deus ex "predicted" it first
[0:24:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> 2 DAYS?!
[0:24:46] <%greasypete00> LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS
[0:24:46] <cardamomo88> BIG PREMONITION POWER OF KOJIMA
[0:24:47] <Tracazoid> I'm playing Death Stranding the Covid delivery simulator as we speak.
[0:24:47] <marvel877> BIG OOF
[0:24:47] <%YakumoYomi> I mean, Death Stranding kinda did that with COVID
[0:24:49] <shlorpaderp> Konami = nine eleven? Hm.
[0:24:49] <%templar010> Kojima needs to stop being a precog
[0:24:52] <+ninja_galt> Those terrorists tried to blow up the twin towers two times before they succeeded.
[0:24:55] <Profmcstevie> Welp....couldn't have seen that coming
[0:24:58] <FutaSnek> AWW FUCK
[0:25:02] <inutaihanyou123> glad 911 evolved from drakengards "dynasty warrior heroes are so weird"
[0:25:03] <doctordinkus> same with lilo and stitch
[0:25:03] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:25:07] <%ringabal> Kojima: "I can use this..."
[0:25:08] <FutaSnek> JUST SCRAP IT ALL LUL
[0:25:13] <%livlinn> note
[0:25:15] <%possumwalsh1221> “Aw shit did we cause this Aw fuck me”
[0:25:15] <cardamomo88> is always kojima
[0:25:15] <OkamiDude15> @FutaSnek arsenal gear but yeah shits fucked
[0:25:17] <+oktavia_von> oof
[0:25:17] <+JustToWatch> "OH FUCK"
[0:25:19] <i_need_sciss0rz> back to the drawing board lmao
[0:25:19] <%greasypete00> was that cutscene ever made available to the public
[0:25:19] <+vascillia> kojima predcited 9/11, predicted twitter and facebook, why can't he predict us some healthcare
[0:25:19] <%livlinn> NotLikeThis
[0:25:20] <FutaSnek> GET THE CONTENT SHOTGUN LUL
[0:25:22] <+ninja_galt> it was predictable because there were previous attacks on the twin towers for years before 9/11
[0:25:26] <nevan_44> monkaS
[0:25:26] <shlorpaderp> imagine if it came out on 9/10
[0:25:27] <%Ranryu692> I would hope that the reason is because people are still dying from 9/11-related illnesses, with 9/11's death toll being much closer to 6,000 than 3,000, but a lot of people don't know that
[0:25:28] <brachydios777> Kojima (2001)-"AW FUCK!"
[0:25:31] <kikoeru_san> Pokemon B/W is in NYC and where ground zero is there is a crater and the pokemon that caused it was the measurement 9'11''
[0:25:32] <%miguelrod777> it all has to go
[0:25:35] <thelonechris> Death Stranding; where you are an essential deliveryman during an apocalyptic event where everyone is inside hiding from an invisible enemy
[0:25:39] <marvel877> GTA3 clipped the wings on the one playable plane in the game to keep it from flying because of 9/11
[0:25:43] <%a_goth_pancake> mgs2 is scary, that one guy is a vampire.
[0:25:48] <FutaSnek> @OkamiDude15 Oh yea your totally right I just replaced that with the other one in my brain for some reason LUL
[0:25:48] <echobee_tv> Release the 9 11 cut
[0:25:55] <Mattais88> "Okay guys we've got to super crunch now"
[0:25:56] <OkamiDude15> @vascillia cant predict something that wont happen evoCry i hate it here bro

[0:26:31] <+vascillia> @OkamiDude15 same brother. it's fucked up I'm an adult who has to make financial decisions based on if I think it's worth risking my life going to the ER
[0:26:32] <%ejackalope> I was 4 when it happened. I was so young. lol
[0:26:33] <+D00msDayDan> @sasparillatango you should it's rad

[0:26:40] <Virokwet> taht was a wierd day
[0:26:41] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Isn't 9/11 related to NieR more because of how people do horrible things because they think they are in the right?
[0:26:42] <dan_g_v> very bigly bad
[0:26:42] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> That was my Mom's Brithday

[0:26:56] <thelonechris> This stream is probably on a list now
[0:26:57] <shieldecho> Who is good baby
[0:26:57] <+D00msDayDan> that take is so hot it could melt steel beams
[0:26:58] <Mattais88> which was wierd because we just heard a presentation about it being first reposnders day becase 9-1-1-
[0:26:58] <$hewlettfan96> Damn
[0:27:01] <$Ziegsy> But it did bring us the boston airport jungle juice
[0:27:01] <battlexqueen> Nice
[0:27:04] <%Make_me_mad> Me and my mom were both home sick when it happened. She called me in the room to watch it on TV and said "We're going to war with somebody."
[0:27:04] <marvel877> We heard about it in school, I thought nothing of it at the time because I'm some dumb teen, then I get home and the big gravity of it is all over the tv.
[0:27:06] <%greasypete00> <#

[0:27:33] <Profmcstevie> Is playful
[0:27:34] <+vascillia> @PatStaresAt every time I've read on this it's about overstimulation and them telling you "ok that's enough" but not knowing that it hurts us
[0:27:35] <JetpackMcQuack> Why 4Head

[0:38:11] <Ciglossonjr> Do it on Table Top Simulator
[0:38:13] <%JoshManVGH> Minis and paint is a booming market
[0:38:14] <+Tunnelcakesrule> I just got into Warhammer 40k. Been having a bunch of fun painting and building models

[0:38:39] <Ciglossonjr> We're in
[0:38:40] <JetpackMcQuack> IT'S A TRAP
[0:38:41] <derap41> if it was a sim it wouldn't be as fun
[0:38:44] <%Monkeyweed21> yea but it wouldnt cost 5K per army set
[0:38:46] <scientiafidem> only thing worse is MTG, at least the figures look nice, instead of being overpriced cardboard that looks like a pringle out the box.

[0:44:27] <oda_flobunaga> Mass Effect 3 is like BSG, it only shits itself in the final room
[0:44:28] <datlambo458> Nier is more important
[0:44:29] <BeezusHrist> @valriot AFTER the endgame patch
[0:44:31] <+Calek> FF14 Fanfest this weekend too
[0:44:33] <derap41> Man Elmo is going to town on his butt
[0:44:34] <Calamity2007> @valriot I imagine the rerelease will have all the DLC and I heard the ME3 DLC is preety good
[0:44:35] <%thetunnelhomer> Lies, ME3 falls apart around the 45% mark
[0:44:35] <mesamus> warner has the movie rights so apparently that includes music
[0:44:37] <datlambo458> Feel will do mass effect for you
[0:44:49] <cardamomo88> oof
[0:44:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> @derap41 That's his thigh, not his butt
[0:44:54] <$Futurecity10> You mean Gene

[0:44:57] <%valriot> @Calamity2007 Its great, Citadel is a nice dlc
[0:44:59] <%vascillia> ME3 has one good part and it's Tuchaunka and that's it, nothing else reaches anywhere close that high
[0:45:01] <xeros720> time to see if it catches on fire
[0:45:01] <%greasypete00> squock diddy
[0:45:02] <datlambo458> uh oh

[0:45:28] <%Dementedpenguin> .....
[0:45:28] <ergulor> OOF
[0:45:29] <oda_flobunaga> That's absurd
[0:45:29] <%bugz_munny> wat

[0:45:34] <%cvp5127> oh boi
[0:45:34] <nevan_44> ??? LUL
[0:45:35] <%AllenDeadman> oh no
[0:45:37] <BeezusHrist> Ya'll must have not played ME3
[0:45:37] <ergulor> like how i mean
[0:45:38] <dan_g_v> it's good to see they are sure of their game and don't need filthy reviews
[0:45:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WTF EA
[0:45:40] <%Jeemukun> IT TAKES THAT LONG TO BEAT THE FIRST ONE
[0:45:40] <derap41> 48 hours on a 200+ game
[0:45:40] <%vascillia> Mass Effect "we took out all of the colors for realism" Legendary Edition
[0:45:41] <%Ranryu692> that's shady AF
[0:45:41] <%cvp5127> cant wait
[0:45:41] <datlambo458> thats f'd up
[0:45:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just beat the whole game in one sitting
[0:45:42] <JetpackMcQuack> let's wait a week
[0:45:42] <%bugz_munny> you actually cant
[0:45:42] <%thetunnelhomer> @BeezusHrist I'd argue it shakes a little at the Citadel coup, and falls right apart at Thessia
[0:45:42] <%weissguard> Oh noooo
[0:45:43] <Tracazoid> LUL That's so bad. "Play our RPG collection in two days fuckers."
[0:45:45] <%Monkeyweed21> THATS NOT PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE
[0:45:45] <%Jeemukun> the FUCK EA
[0:45:45] <%Reveresao> It's coming in HOT then
[0:45:46] <%possumwalsh1221> Welp
[0:45:47] <dan_g_v> oh so very confident on their game :3
[0:45:48] <%AllenDeadman> was it an embargo for speed runners?
[0:45:48] <peyodogo> that's amazing
[0:45:52] <FutaSnek> ARE THEY TRYING TO PROMOTE SPEEDRUNS?
[0:45:52] <karovus> that would be absurd for a single mass effect game
[0:45:52] <+ladomania> lmao like cyberpunk
[0:45:52] <thelonechris> Emlo
[0:45:52] <deviljhojho_> i bet they spite changed the ME3 ending to be even worse
[0:45:53] <CSeriesJTYPE> the entire fucking game review industry should just go on general strike
[0:45:55] <%valriot> That seems more like an EA thing, didnt they do that for something recently????
[0:45:56] <brachydios777> DansGame DansGame DansGame
[0:45:58] <%bread_assassin> What can you do? Play the first couple hours of 1 than just skip to 2?
[0:45:58] <%Make_me_mad> I bought it because I just wanna play ME1 again.
[0:45:59] <BlueBiscuitGT> There's something they don't want the reviewers to see?
[0:46:00] <+Calek> ME1 maybe but not all 3
[0:46:00] <Dragovus> Does anyone else smell that burning dumpster fire?
[0:46:00] <sadboy_otoroshi> Sucks to be a Game journo in that situation.
[0:46:01] <%cvp5127> so wait 2 days got it
[0:46:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Not enough time to find the bullshit
[0:46:03] <Virokwet> they cant fucked this up, its just a fancy port
[0:46:04] <%JoshManVGH> oh yeah, Jank Effect Legendary Edition
[0:46:04] <%mister___doctor> I guess I'll play something else then
[0:46:05] <xeros720> didn't bethesda start doing that for all their games? admittedly, all their games are busted, so y'know
[0:46:07] <%Dementedpenguin> 48 hours to review a space adventure trilogy 4Head
[0:46:08] <peyodogo> there's rubbernecking on the horizon
[0:46:09] <%averyoddjew> all the more reason to never buy it
[0:46:13] <derap41> like 2010
[0:46:15] <BeezusHrist> @thetunnelhomer I like the Citadel coup and thessia. Music was awesome
[0:46:15] <%MisterRockett> For THREE FULL ACTION RPG GAMES?!
[0:46:16] <JetpackMcQuack> just show me :)
[0:46:23] <BlueBiscuitGT> Forever ago
[0:46:30] <cardamomo88> LUL LUL
[0:46:37] <BeezusHrist> @thetunnelhomer that's when shit gets REAL
[0:46:39] <%psidefx> SCWarbage
[0:46:40] <%AllenDeadman> LUL
[0:46:42] <%thetunnelhomer> Okay, but the story though. KAI LENG
[0:46:50] <%vascillia> I knew I wasn't going to buy Mass Effect Legendary Edition when they showed the scene of Sovereign emerging for the first time and they completely removed the scary, ominous red sky to just...a regular sky
[0:46:56] <%MelBrooksKA> @xeros720 They started doing it with Doom2016
[0:46:57] <oda_flobunaga> 48 hours for 3, 50 hour games
[0:46:58] <sadboy_otoroshi> Those are ancient tales you're telling Pat
[0:47:07] <Calamity2007> @Virokwet Do we need to bring up the Batman Arkham PS4 ports
[0:47:13] <derap41> a Decade ago
[0:47:18] <deviljhojho_> very satisfied with the nier remake tbh
[0:47:28] <%averyoddjew> oh god... i remember that game... hit me right in the age
[0:47:28] <xeros720> @MelBrooksKA oh yeah, you made me remember the people were really cagey about it on launch due to that
[0:47:28] <+ZipperHands> but you got a Kiane
[0:47:29] <%psidefx> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo

[0:47:47] <brachydios777> Time for sadness
[0:47:48] <JetpackMcQuack> IT"S TOO LATE
[0:47:50] <BeezusHrist> Im just not interested in Mass effect as it was. It's 2021 and that gameplay is no longer fresh
[0:47:51] <%NitronStreams> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:47:51] <%Arancet> failing to make a repliCANT joke

[0:48:15] <battlexqueen> Im leaving
[0:48:15] <%bugz_munny> no audio
[0:48:15] <%cvp5127> muted
[0:48:17] <%a_goth_pancake> how can we turn this repliCAN'T into a repliCAN?
[0:48:18] <mike2hands> PAT WITH THE DAD JOKES now he's got two kids
[0:48:23] <%averyoddjew> WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS
[0:48:24] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt If you are wondering about the quests you need to do, there is only one weapon related quest in the first arc of the game
[0:48:24] <%OswaldTheDog> Wow
[0:48:24] <brachydios777> Are these jokes?
[0:48:25] <UberKingKai> TO THE VAN WITH YOU
[0:48:26] <peyodogo> christ
[0:48:28] <%Zeikier> you finished the forest of myth last time right?
[0:48:29] <%BoxNavy> hell yeah sidequest stream
[0:48:29] <%Monkeyweed21> I replicant Ver.1.22464487139 even
[0:48:29] <BeezusHrist> If they somehow added ME Andromeda's mechanics to the trilogy, I might buy
[0:48:30] <%thetunnelhomer> Gestalt remake when?
[0:48:30] <BlueBiscuitGT> Isn't there an identical joke in that game from Suda 51? mexi-can, not mexi-can't?
[0:48:41] <%Zeikier> I'm so glad they kept the Yonah loading icons
[0:48:42] <%cvp5127> no audio
[0:48:42] <%Monkeyweed21> no sound
[0:48:44] <shieldecho> I've been playing this game for 45 hours and I'm still sometimes confused whenever I see this anime twink instead of Papa Nier
[0:48:46] <thelonechris> Porn tab
[0:48:51] <cardamomo88> NO SOUND
[0:48:53] <+Caidezes> Way to go.
[0:48:55] <%a_goth_pancake> gotta get back to work, miss you already
[0:48:56] <OkamiDude15> what about all the far ones
[0:48:58] <Ethel9727> I think they fixed it so you can't miss weapons in this one
[0:49:01] <brachydios777> Audio low
[0:49:02] <%Ynkubus_> there's audio it's just low
[0:49:02] <DSD24> @BlueBiscuitGT Wasn't that line from a movie actually with
[0:49:05] <%vascillia> @PatStaresAt you can't miss any waepons during this part
[0:49:06] <sadboy_otoroshi> No sound?
[0:49:06] <$Ziegsy> We repli-cant hear it
[0:49:06] <%BoxNavy> wish we could hear it
[0:49:07] <rei0> what music?
[0:49:09] <DSD24> Music we can't here
[0:49:10] <%Shadowevilkoala> just break all boxes in part 1 thats where the weapons are in part 1
[0:49:10] <%Arancet> be nice if we oculd hear it
[0:49:12] <rei0> D:
[0:49:12] <+D00msDayDan> loving this music
[0:49:14] <%bugz_munny> no sound
[0:49:17] <adelym0> @PatStaresAt any you miss in p1 you can get in p2
[0:49:19] <cardamomo88> NOT SOUND
[0:49:20] <%greasypete00> there arent that many in part one
[0:49:22] <nevan_44> what music? :)
[0:49:22] <%BoxNavy> there ya go
[0:49:22] <%Zeikier> in case you're wondering, Part 1 has 36 quests if you're worried about numbers before ending Part 1
[0:49:23] <oda_flobunaga> did you get Faith?
[0:49:24] <%Kiso52> yeah thats better
[0:49:27] <%Monkeyweed21> 1 more in the Mansion
[0:49:30] <%livlinn> shiaHypers shiaHypers shiaHypers
[0:49:30] <sadboy_otoroshi> Yep no sound
[0:49:31] <brachydios777> Better
[0:49:34] <cardamomo88> pat Kappa
[0:49:36] <%averyoddjew> yay sound
[0:49:36] <shieldecho> Seafront music is so relaxing
[0:49:40] <Profmcstevie> Strong stream so far
[0:49:42] <BeezusHrist> @shieldecho Neir Automata should have made you familiar with this character
[0:49:42] <oda_flobunaga> Okay, you are good then
[0:49:45] <%Kiso52> god that music
[0:49:45] <%vascillia> When I heard they were reworking the music for this game I went OH NOO but it turns out it rules. Almost every song now has an extended coda outro
[0:49:50] <$Ziegsy> Urianger is my favourite mansion
[0:49:55] <%Zeikier> you totally wanted to do Life in the Sands
[0:49:59] <oda_flobunaga> You don't need to do any of them
[0:50:00] <Blank9> they don't matter it's fine
[0:50:01] <primaryfire> the only other sidequest weapons are in p2
[0:50:06] <%vascillia> @PatStaresAt
[0:50:06] <%Figleafplays> the fragile delivery quests can FUCK RIGHT OFF
[0:50:08] <%Monkeyweed21> Runaway Son is good
[0:50:09] <%vascillia> oops
[0:50:10] <deviljhojho_> i like the lighthouse lady quest
[0:50:13] <%averyoddjew> if they don't have a weapon, who cares
[0:50:14] <JetpackMcQuack> And fishing
[0:50:15] <dan_g_v> 100 percent!
[0:50:18] <+evbites> cool story ones
[0:50:22] <+D00msDayDan> the ideal way to play nier is to use cheat engine to give yourself all the materials fetch quests and weapon upgrades need
[0:50:22] <%Zeikier> Runaway Son is great yeah
[0:50:25] <dan_g_v> gogogo full completition!
[0:50:26] <%Maids4lyfe> mermaid quest is cool af
[0:50:31] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt mermaid is integrated into the story
[0:50:33] <deviljhojho_> oh yeah
[0:50:34] <%BoxNavy> yep
[0:50:36] <datlambo458> Yeahhh
[0:50:37] <+NYCrownlessKing> yoko taro: i know
[0:50:40] <FutaSnek> Its like a 6/10
[0:50:40] <DSD24> Pacing wise yeah
[0:50:41] <brachydios777> Fuck fragil delivery!
[0:50:41] <%thetunnelhomer> I remember the Thieves quest being alright.
[0:50:42] <%vascillia> Did pat catch the Shaman fish? They added a cutscene if you fuck it up since so many people couldn't get past it in 2010
[0:50:42] <echobee_tv> amen to that
[0:50:42] <cardamomo88> yes
[0:50:43] <JetpackMcQuack> Hell yeah 7/10
[0:50:43] <%Monkeyweed21> Runaway Son is really good @PatStaresAt
[0:50:45] <datlambo458> playthrough c is actual hell
[0:50:46] <+D00msDayDan> i love when games that are good suck
[0:50:47] <Profmcstevie> BIG sucks
[0:50:48] <%Shadowevilkoala> I disagree about the side quests, they have pretty interesting stories to them
[0:50:50] <%averyoddjew> tho getting money in the second half is basically necessary
[0:50:51] <deviljhojho_> its like the game wants you to not play it
[0:50:52] <primaryfire> running through the game 3 times is highkey pretty ass
[0:50:53] <%BoxNavy> its on purpose :)
[0:50:56] <%Maids4lyfe> it's because Yoko Taro hates 100% completionists
[0:50:58] <%Zeikier> this game without completion is good, but if you're going for Platinum this game has nothing but spite for you and everything you hold dear
[0:51:02] <%greasypete00> "get me 10 titanium alloys and a memory alloy for my new cookware"
[0:51:02] <thelonechris> Developwhores
[0:51:03] <tattleworm> you've absolutely gotta do "the promised gift" in part 2, it's new to replicant @PatStaresAt
[0:51:06] <JetpackMcQuack> A thoughtful drama trapped inside a mediocre PS3 game
[0:51:06] <deviljhojho_> its all planned ya know tomatoSmile
[0:51:07] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt when you have to play it 3 times over and over, the luster wanes a bit
[0:51:12] <DSD24> Like that No More Heroes 2 fight in the Mall?
[0:51:12] <%BoxNavy> japanese video game auteurs love doing that
[0:51:13] <datlambo458> it was not on purpose for an artistic reason
[0:51:14] <primaryfire> I'm in the middle of ending E right now and I'm so burnt out
[0:51:19] <%Zeikier> to be fair! the grind for mats in this game is WAY better than the grind for offline PVP covenant items in Dark Souls
[0:51:21] <anglebreakfast> Im on playthrough 4 now and mm im feeling it bad
[0:51:22] <FutaSnek> Depends if their using that excuse to hide bullshit or not LUL
[0:51:24] <%vascillia> The only "bad on purpose" I'll buy is the Genocide run of undertale. Storywise the game itself is fighting against you finishing it
[0:51:25] <Ethel9727> I think "I made this bad on purpose" is fine as long as it is a small part.
[0:51:26] <LunarRemix> Didn't Suda wanted to make a boss that attacks your FPS directly for No More Heroes?
[0:51:33] <%OswaldTheDog> Yeah, some of these sections......
[0:51:34] <dan_g_v> better do them all just to be safe
[0:51:34] <brachydios777> Definitly a Taro thing
[0:51:49] <%BoxNavy> its super good
[0:51:49] <%vascillia> hideo kojima wanted the fight with The End to be like 4 hours long
[0:51:50] <BeezusHrist> When did Kaine show up?
[0:51:50] <karovus> i did all the quests because i love this game but holy shit most are not worth doing on stream if at all
[0:51:52] <%Zeikier> I thought Taro wanted the boss to attack framerate
[0:51:52] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the Runaway Son is good
[0:51:58] <JetpackMcQuack> The rule room really pushed me
[0:52:03] <Blank9> most of the "bad on purpose" stuff with taro is a limit of bad developers
[0:52:04] <cardamomo88> uyyy
[0:52:05] <%s1rcuit> what was that tip about the eagle egg?
[0:52:09] <%ringabal> HAH
[0:52:09] <oda_flobunaga> I have the same problem with this that I have with Automata, namely, there are too many shit sid quests
[0:52:10] <deviljhojho_> he knows crikScheme
[0:52:11] <primaryfire> ending E is wild but still requires you to play for like 2 hours to get to the new stuff
[0:52:12] <%Maids4lyfe> @BeezusHrist after first dungeon
[0:52:14] <%possumwalsh1221> I’m gonna get to ending E today Pog
[0:52:16] <maskedmook> this is my favorite game, I 100% completed it and would NEVER recommend doing all sidequests
[0:52:17] <%vascillia> @PatStaresAt Here's a tip to save a lot of time over the course of the game if you want. If you hate taking that stupid small fucking bridge from nier's house to get into town you can actually clear that jump from the pile of blocks to the unfinished pier/bridge instead of going all the way around
[0:52:19] <%BoxNavy> there are new cutscenes in the ending c route
[0:52:20] <sadboy_otoroshi> You can't tell if it is poor design or just artistic integrity
[0:52:21] <nevan_44> LUL
[0:52:21] <Ethel9727> Part 3 has some new cutscene stuff throughout it
[0:52:26] <+skyheys> Route C has new scenes now lmao
[0:52:34] <oda_flobunaga> Correct
[0:52:35] <mike2hands> HELP GRANDPA
[0:52:39] <datlambo458> yes but its really small
[0:52:39] <%averyoddjew> the new stuff is unavoidable
[0:52:40] <%Figleafplays> the shit you have to repeat is very annoying.
[0:52:41] <%vascillia> @PatStaresAt most consistent way i found is stand on the tallest brick, jump ONCE toward bridge, do a 2-3 hit combo, double jump, air-dodge and you'll clear it easily. AND it's just really fun to do too! Saves a TON of time throughout the game
[0:52:43] <Daniel_Is_I> Yes part 3 has new cutscenes
[0:52:44] <+Calek> you can't skip the new scenes in route C I believe
[0:52:47] <%possumwalsh1221> The new stuff in C is obvious tho you can tell in seconds
[0:52:50] <JetpackMcQuack> that's 3 hours right there
[0:52:54] <balthazar758> psaGib
[0:52:57] <Tracazoid> Yeah little bits here and there in Part 3, they aren't skippable though if I remember correctly since they're text talking bits and not proper cutscenes
[0:52:59] <mr_saturday93> Route B has some new scenes too I believe
[0:53:02] <BeezusHrist> I have never played this game and don't plan to anytime soon
[0:53:05] <BeezusHrist> LUL
[0:53:05] <%ssjklyco> rolling makes you move faster by the way.
[0:53:07] <deviljhojho_> wait so i cant skipp all cutscenes in C?
[0:53:13] <@BigNaturalMan59> you should do the Sawcon quest
[0:53:18] <tattleworm> you can skip a lot of stuff when you get spears, their light aerial string pushes you way forward
[0:53:23] <%vascillia> you can skip cutscenes in C except for the ending
[0:53:23] <datlambo458> You can skip most of c but it will still have to be played on stream so we can see the new stuff
[0:53:23] <primaryfire> @s1rcuit there's a quest where you're asked to fetch an eagle egg but the reward is puny and eagle eggs are rare. don't finish the quest (unless you want 100%) and keep the egg for later so you can upgrade the phoenix spear since it's the best waepon in the game
[0:53:28] <deviljhojho_> Which quest is that
[0:53:29] <%BoxNavy> @BigNaturalMan59 whats ligma?
[0:53:33] <+ZipperHands> Route B and C have new cutscenes
[0:53:33] <%Arek_1> LUL
[0:53:37] <adelym0> perhaps the sugondese one
[0:53:37] <@BigNaturalMan59> sawcon deez nuts
[0:53:40] <@BigNaturalMan59> GOTTEM
[0:53:41] <OkamiDude15> who's steve jobs
[0:53:42] <%vascillia> wats updog
[0:53:42] <%averyoddjew> there's a lot of new stuff on the second playthrough and the third
[0:53:43] <+Promessa_EX> Willma quest
[0:53:44] <%Zeikier> steve jobs
[0:53:45] <oda_flobunaga> One thing I will say, is that while you have to play Mermaid at least 3 times, I got it to play out 3 different ways which was interesting
[0:53:48] <deviljhojho_> tomatoDry no....
[0:53:49] <%weissguard> LUL
[0:53:52] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Yeah, you unlock it after beating the Sofa King.

[0:53:59] <%s1rcuit> @primaryfire thanks
[0:54:01] <+BIumen> @PatStaresAt can you check word edit to see if you got lugma yet
[0:54:01] <ExpressNode> LUL
[0:54:02] <%bhp_99> I think it's related to the gulpin quest
[0:54:04] <Alkiryas> Not just new stuff it is the entire point of the game, the things that you see on those routes
[0:54:06] <ScreamLord> What about the Updawg Quest?
[0:54:08] <+NYCrownlessKing> Route C tip = stick to looking at Little Mermaid content for new stuff. everything surrounding that. @PatStaresAt
[0:54:09] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[0:54:16] <JetpackMcQuack> Love a good plump quest
[0:54:18] <%vascillia> Yo realtalk I think the VA for young Nier is really fucking good in this game. I wasn't as impressed by adult Nier

[0:55:57] <+BIumen> weiss is a zoomer he floats for tiktok
[0:55:58] <tattleworm> i miss papa nier but something about the way weiss says lad is very comforting
[0:55:58] <%vascillia> red bag guy is so cool, best addition to ver 1.22
[0:55:58] <cardamomo88> LUL
[0:55:59] <%BoxNavy> wow that nothing sure did get in your way
[0:56:03] <Nupinoop296> Bro gets a book bag for Weissy
[0:56:03] <%miguelrod777> magic stamina
[0:56:05] <%LouieRouie> He does
[0:56:08] <twohitgood> magic takes energy to use
[0:56:09] <greene411> How does a book recover stamina?
[0:56:15] <%averyoddjew> magic takes energy for him
[0:56:17] <%Zeikier> he wants to make sure Nier stops complaining about walking
[0:56:22] <%LouieRouie> Magic takes effort\
[0:56:24] <karovus> well he does fall down in that one cutscene
[0:56:28] <%weissguard> Wouldn't using magic also tire you out? To sustain a spell, you'd use mana or somethin'?
[0:56:29] <%solracc25> Cranky book
[0:56:31] <shieldecho> Big shad show up whenever cloudy
[0:56:32] <%averyoddjew> HE KILLED GOATS
[0:56:35] <%OswaldTheDog> but like does he just crawl on the ground if he doesn’t use his stamina?

[0:57:12] <+Promessa_EX> normal doesn't require knowing how to play
[0:57:14] <OkamiDude15> @OswaldTheDog he kinda hops around at one point
[0:57:15] <%ssjklyco> So the whole game, I kept accidentally trying to melee with R1/R2

[1:01:58] <%vascillia> I can't imagine it would be all that difficult to mod papa nier in the game- the biggest obstacle would be the 3 or so prerendered scenes I think?
[1:01:58] <%BoxNavy> we have to kill each and every ugly evil one
[1:01:59] <%ssjklyco> They are shady characters
[1:02:02] <deviljhojho_> time passes and he gets old
[1:02:03] <OkamiDude15> @baronouroboros no because not everyone played the og and there is new things in this version
[1:02:04] <echobee_tv> Has Square mentioned sales numbers for this game yet?
[1:02:05] <%RetroCop87> I love how much young Nier ramps up the Shade hate more than Papa Nier
[1:02:05] <Ethel9727> Wakka thinks we need some kind of solution to finally deal with these shades
[1:02:08] <%GalacticaPhanto> @blank9 only to one and he murders the fuck outta of him
[1:02:08] <%vascillia> err not mod, patch/DLC I meant to say
[1:02:10] <+Jack8274> The sound is funky
[1:02:12] <%thetunnelhomer> Such a vile, and disgusting monster race
[1:02:15] <datlambo458> oh yeah, i forgot about the prostitution short story, oof
[1:02:18] <%Figleafplays> papa nier is in the game o
[1:02:18] <+RyTYoung> Oh hey gang how are we all doing?
[1:02:19] <%athuramn> when you consider the war crimes in this game, nier's voice is a very scary pleasant contrast
[1:02:20] <%baronouroboros> k
[1:02:21] <tattleworm> wait, i thought you killed the boar?
[1:02:27] <%shurtal> Kill the ugly, small, illiterate shades

[1:03:25] <%shurtal> the shade MUST have killed her, there's no other possible explination
[1:03:25] <deviljhojho_> my favorite combo is dark lance into prone, and then circle for one hit kill

[1:07:04] <ToneBacas> Pat will eat literal poison to trick Paige into eating it herself
[1:07:06] <BeezusHrist> @Jack8274 I obviously disagree. Some people are just born bad

[1:13:34] <%psidefx> Weiss the GOAT
[1:13:37] <%vascillia> At first I was so worried that they were re-doing the VA for this game, but I realize it means they can add tons of new shit like this now and it's 100% organic
[1:13:49] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> I need art of Weiss chain-smoking now
[1:13:51] <JetpackMcQuack> He's a boomer
[1:13:54] <scientiafidem> NierMan please stop having relationship issues with your magic book.
[1:13:55] <OkamiDude15> @BallerSwagBro9k just regular people as far we. the viewer, know at this point
[1:13:56] <+Promessa_EX> it is
[1:13:58] <%RetroCop87> Pat, you not doing all the childhood sidequests?
[1:13:58] <%psidefx> Ye
[1:13:58] <+BIumen> that couple mentioned magazines so they got contemporary mind juice
[1:13:59] <%miguelrod777> hyah hyah
[1:14:01] <%ringabal> HYAAAH
[1:14:01] <%weissguard> Almost like Grimoire Weiss has a little human in him. Kappa
[1:14:01] <%BoxNavy> this is a zelda game after all
[1:14:02] <%thetunnelhomer> Zelda strats
[1:14:03] <%ssjklyco> YEah, game ruined for pat
[1:14:05] <+Promessa_EX> it's like 4% faster
[1:14:05] <%athuramn> you don't like link rolling all over the place?
[1:14:06] <BlueBiscuitGT> them speedrun strats
[1:14:08] <cardamomo88> rolllll
[1:14:08] <%Breaknoon> just do it to the rhythm of the music
[1:14:08] <datlambo458> im honestly not sure
[1:14:08] <BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt Weiss is NOT a boomer. Weiss was a young man
[1:14:09] <JetpackMcQuack> dash-attack-dash-attack-
[1:14:10] <%NitronStreams> HYAH
[1:14:12] <%RetroCop87> fair enough
[1:14:13] <TacoFunBox> Roll to Victory Pat!
[1:14:13] <+skyheys> rolling is STILL FASTER. YES.
[1:14:19] <%thetunnelhomer> Sidequest bad
[1:14:20] <%RetroCop87> they're good for gold farming in 2nd half
[1:14:20] <+ZipperHands> How much pop culture knowledge you think he's got in him?
[1:14:22] <%ringabal> Pat has given up. More at 11.
[1:14:22] <brachydios777> Techically he is made with human history
[1:14:32] <datlambo458> except for when kaine and weiss yell at each other during them
[1:14:33] <%Kingkaiju0618> Cheer5700, hey pat, loved the re8 streams, question, I have a bunch of guy working on replacing my roof, all Mexican, no one speaks English, they have been working for 11 hours now, is it bad I brought them 3 18 packs of modelo, and a bottle of tequila?
[1:14:33] <battlexqueen> Thats fair
[1:14:33] <%baronouroboros> try doing the whole game just with attack animations
[1:14:36] <%capnbeefs> Just keep on getting rolling
[1:14:36] <cardamomo88> juts let make plot honestly
[1:14:38] <oda_flobunaga> The only ones that matter are the weapon ones, the rest can fuck right off
[1:14:38] <%thedankestmeeme> weiss also knows about scorpions he has a special dialogue about them
[1:14:40] <%vascillia> almost every single sidequest in this game is a bullshit fetch quest or "go to this location far away", just kinda designed to waste your time
[1:14:41] <%PkSilent01> Are you going to do the sidequest that gives you weapons so you can get the other endings
[1:14:43] <%athuramn> did he actually have quite the problem tho
[1:14:43] <%bread_assassin> Ya gonna have to make money for the weapons somehow, though.
[1:14:51] <JetpackMcQuack> 57 dollar comma
[1:14:52] <+Promessa_EX> lol i did a bit of that
[1:14:52] <%baronouroboros> Wait, that was a video?
[1:14:52] <Virokwet> but why roll when the protag auto sprints
[1:14:58] <%baronouroboros> Gods, what a coincidence
[1:15:05] <+Promessa_EX> when you go to the mansion and cant run, attacking becomes faster
[1:15:07] <%RetroCop87> she's going to murder big brother with dinner
[1:15:08] <RWLJr98> Bad take. They’re in other games theyre like 60% of the game
[1:15:11] <%Kingkaiju0618> Cheer5700 , hey pat, loved the re8 streams, question, I have a bunch of guy working on replacing my roof, all Mexican, no one speaks English, they have been working for 11 hours now, is it bad I brought them 3 18 packs of modelo, and a bottle of tequila?
[1:15:14] <%averyoddjew> time to go meet DA BOY
[1:15:18] <%thetunnelhomer> I like the think Automata's sidequests were better, but I can't really remember.
[1:15:29] <%RetroCop87> You mean Mihn?
[1:15:31] <LunarRemix> That was crazy
[1:15:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WAIT ARE DEROLA AND POPOLA ANDROIDS HERE TOO?
[1:15:37] <+Jack8274> Why?
[1:15:41] <oda_flobunaga> seems not very fun
[1:15:49] <%thedankestmeeme> @kingkaiju0618 I WISH I WAS DOING YOUR ROOF
[1:15:51] <brachydios777> That was nuts
[1:15:53] <%capnbeefs> Oh god no
[1:15:53] <+Promessa_EX> nah no androids in nier replicant
[1:15:53] <Orenjevel> people are crazy, just sprint everywhere like a normal person
[1:15:56] <%Breaknoon> smoilers
[1:15:58] <OkamiDude15> @BallerSwagBro9k yes but different
[1:16:01] <%superc37> @ballerswagbro9k wait dude did you not watch or play gestalt?
[1:16:07] <%capnbeefs> Rich boi
[1:16:09] <%RetroCop87> little nice, little racist
[1:16:11] <%Arek_1> LUL
[1:16:17] <%thetunnelhomer> Do not mix Tequila and roof work.
[1:16:20] <Djinnazz> Alcohol while working
[1:16:20] <+Jack8274> Alcohol and roof workers?
[1:16:23] <Psyramics> do you want drunk roofers? cause that's how you get drunk roofers
[1:16:25] <%BoxNavy> hit me up the next time you need your roof fixed my man
[1:16:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @superc37 Nope only Automata
[1:16:28] <%ssjklyco> That's a roof situation
[1:16:30] <Psyramics> they gonna be like Mr. Feel and fall off the roof
[1:16:32] <%JoshManVGH> No Consequences!
[1:16:34] <+Jack8274> That sounds like death
[1:16:35] <datlambo458> I think nier original has a more interesting story and lore around it, but automata is far better executed in game (but i like the characters far more in replicant).
[1:16:37] <%thetunnelhomer> Or else you will not have a roof
[1:16:39] <%Breaknoon> yeah, meth and hard work go together better
[1:16:40] <mike2hands> I mean the BEER is ok but you should bring them something to eat too
[1:16:41] <%Dakuu75> oni-chaaaaaaan
[1:16:41] <%thedankestmeeme> drunk roofing is finerre
[1:16:43] <%NateyBeak> Tequila Sunset Roof Party
[1:16:44] <%Maids4lyfe> Never mix alcohol with roofers
[1:16:44] <%psidefx> Not a good combo roofing and drinking
[1:16:46] <%RetroCop87> man, the way Yonah says "yay!" just rubs me wrong
[1:16:51] <%miguelrod777> drunk roof workers are a norm lmao
[1:16:51] <JetpackMcQuack> More to go around
[1:16:54] <%ringabal> YONAH NO
[1:16:58] <%thedankestmeeme> its loke riding a bike anyone can do it drunk
[1:16:58] <%Divryne> More than one Chinese poet have died from night fishing while drunk.
[1:17:02] <%thedankestmeeme> wait
[1:17:02] <mr_saturday93> EMIL
[1:17:06] <+RyTYoung> me too
[1:17:06] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt Did you mean night fishing with dynamite?
[1:17:07] <+fetrigon> DRUNKS CAN'T SWIM
[1:17:08] <LordOfThePoultry> uh oh
[1:17:09] <%NitronStreams> OH SHIT LETS GO
[1:17:11] <%baronouroboros> The idea of doing a gimmick run for Nier just popped into my head. Forgot about that youtuber.
[1:17:12] <%Breaknoon> MC is mad jelly
[1:17:13] <+Promessa_EX> i finished A, kid nier might be my fav
[1:17:13] <%RetroCop87> "His name is Spencer"
[1:17:13] <cardamomo88> oh emil time <3 <3 <3
[1:17:13] <%weissguard> Yonah, you Harlot!
[1:17:16] <doctordinkus> is it as good as alcohol and night swimming, like in the quote?
[1:17:17] <%thetunnelhomer> Oh, I remember this part in Gestalt. Papa Nier Nierly has a heart attack
[1:17:18] <%Dakuu75> even Weiss is like "awwwww"
[1:17:20] <%Kingkaiju0618> @patstaresat nothing has changed lol, you'd think it was watet

[1:17:32] <%averyoddjew> PAT NO
[1:17:32] <SomeAsianDood> kojima taro
[1:17:33] <xbb1024> no
[1:17:33] <%Ranryu692> yes
[1:17:33] <%thetunnelhomer> Nah, Emil is a literary reference. I think
[1:17:34] <%Maids4lyfe> no
[1:17:34] <%Shadowevilkoala> hang on pat is on to something
[1:17:34] <nevan_44> LUL
[1:17:35] <Jediforce317> ... No
[1:17:35] <dan_g_v> you're totally right
[1:17:35] <brachydios777> Wouldn't the context of Devola and Popila be wierd without knowing Gestalt?
[1:17:35] <DiksieNormis> I hate it
[1:17:37] <%JoshManVGH> That's fucking stupid and probably exactly true
[1:17:38] <%thbluewarden> i hope so
[1:17:38] <Ethel9727> NieR is just like "No one will fuck my sister except me!"
[1:17:38] <%TheWinged7> Weissy
[1:17:38] <deviljhojho_> it must be some sort of obscure fairy tale reference right crikSmile
[1:17:39] <Orenjevel> no because his head is the shape of a lime
[1:17:40] <+gitgouda> weissy
[1:17:40] <%thetunnelhomer> Like, Brothers Grim I think?
[1:17:40] <%BoxNavy> well i was on your side pat
[1:17:41] <ammobasket> holy shit
[1:17:41] <MoonKing> emil backwards is lime :)
[1:17:42] <%vascillia> brother nier: "WHO DA FUCK"
[1:17:42] <%NitronStreams> DAMN IT PAT
[1:17:44] <battlexqueen> Hmmmmmmmmmmmm
[1:17:44] <%psidefx> I just had that thought too pat
[1:17:46] <%thedankestmeeme> Email
[1:17:47] <doctordinkus> sounds like a genius kojumbo idea
[1:17:48] <%OswaldTheDog> oh my LORD
[1:17:51] <battlexqueen> Its stupid enough to be true
[1:17:52] <Djinnazz> @brachydios777 yup
[1:17:52] <%capnbeefs> Oh my god
[1:17:53] <%tactician0> insight go up
[1:17:56] <%Breaknoon> Imiru
[1:17:58] <scientiafidem> fuck that is totally it, it's Japan, if it sounds like a pun it is absolutely on purpose.
[1:17:59] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I always had dumb fun with how Emil eventually looks Evil, but we  know he's not Evil... He's Emil
[1:18:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Will this game explain Emils origin?
[1:18:02] <tattleworm> he's named emil because because he lives a mile away
[1:18:02] <OkamiDude15> @brachydios777 ye
[1:18:03] <%Shadowevilkoala> he's out of line, but he's right
[1:18:04] <%vascillia> BUT THOU MUST
[1:18:12] <%RetroCop87> considering some of the stuff Nier's had to do at this point for money, his concern for Yonah is 100% justified
[1:18:15] <%Ranryu692> is that why his sister is named Fax Machine?
[1:18:15] <JetpackMcQuack> He had to think up a name on the fly
[1:18:17] <%weissguard> @BallerSwagBro9k This is his origin.

[1:19:18] <%thetunnelhomer> Also, Emil is named after one of the Brothers Grimm because Fairy Tales.
[1:19:18] <LunarRemix> I imagine a dog is a very different situation vs a cat
[1:19:18] <%OswaldTheDog> Good for him
[1:19:20] <Psyramics> he's gonna come back high as shit
[1:19:22] <datlambo458> i thought my dog would care but he got even more hyper because of it
[1:19:27] <battlexqueen> Ah yes watching balls hea

[1:19:31] <%Breaknoon> bark at the ketamine hallucinations
[1:19:33] <%baronouroboros> I dunno, Weiss? Why do you think?
[1:19:45] <Tomschiii> was the diary entry about accord ever on the original
[1:19:45] <%athuramn> fortunately the shape of your dog makes it really hard for him to lick the affected area so it should be a smoother recovery @PatStaresAt
[1:19:48] <%thedankestmeeme> pat that sounds pretty gay you watching balls
[1:19:52] <%Uselesswhitenoise> low energy dog
[1:19:52] <Acicon> still stuck on this man?
[1:19:53] <%ssjklyco> They gain more weight when they lose them
[1:19:54] <%BoxNavy> but why do the balls fuel him with energy
[1:19:54] <+RyTYoung> @lunarremix they basically take it all away on a male dog
[1:19:55] <+Jack8274> You'd be chill getting your balls cut off?
[1:19:55] <BlueBiscuitGT> He'll sleep even more
[1:19:58] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt are you going to have a bachelor party like thing for him on the night before?

[1:20:26] <+kewlmyc> Just dunking on the Gief
[1:20:28] <nevan_44> :(
[1:20:28] <%RetroCop87> he's shaped like a pill
[1:20:28] <+skyheys> too fat
[1:20:28] <Blank9> bean shaped
[1:20:28] <%Maids4lyfe> oof
[1:20:31] <Tyonidus> Is this game any good?
[1:20:33] <JetpackMcQuack> Can a ball lick itself
[1:20:34] <%valriot> Bread shaped dog
[1:20:34] <%NitronStreams> Brick shaped dog
[1:20:35] <ScreamLord> Fat and wrinkly
[1:20:36] <%athuramn> HE CANT HELP IT
[1:20:38] <%averyoddjew> oh nooo
[1:20:38] <+gitgouda> everybody fair game.
[1:20:39] <%athuramn> he's just pretty
[1:20:41] <%RetroCop87> traingle for breaking
[1:20:43] <%Ranryu692> his turning radius is poor
[1:20:43] <DeathByPoke7> orb dog
[1:20:46] <oda_flobunaga> not a flexi bulldog?
[1:20:46] <%thetunnelhomer> @Tyonidus It's okay
[1:20:47] <UberKingKai> That’s not wrong
[1:20:49] <+gitgouda> can a ball...BOI
[1:20:50] <Dragovus> Scott Steiner: HE'S FAT!
[1:20:50] <%baronouroboros> That's wht the anime swerve is for
[1:20:51] <%Dakuu75> that was a really good one
[1:20:51] <%Shadowevilkoala> if you use hold heavy you can break through shields
[1:20:55] <RWLJr98> He’s an oval
[1:20:57] <%BoxNavy> charged heavy attacks are good for guard breaking
[1:20:58] <$Ziegsy> Will you and paige have the balls bronzed, like some people do to the umbilical chord?
[1:21:00] <%Breaknoon> orb(less) dog
[1:21:00] <+emVulpine> Triangle heavy helps, but it also varies from weapon to weapon.
[1:21:02] <%superc37> @promessa_ex i figured, but it doesnt make it any less less dumb imo
[1:21:03] <%OswaldTheDog> he’s dumpling shapped
[1:21:08] <Orenjevel> didn't you have an elbow attack for guard breaking?
[1:21:12] <ScreamLord> Also his entire body looks like a scrotum so he'll likely never notice they're gone
[1:21:16] <%baronouroboros> Anyway, gotta take my own doggo out now. I'll be back
[1:21:19] <%Breaknoon> equip "FUCK"
[1:21:33] <%RetroCop87> Do you get Phoenix Dagger in pre or post timeskip?
[1:21:43] <%Breaknoon> hold buttan
[1:21:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @RetroCop87 post
[1:21:51] <%averyoddjew> either or
[1:21:53] <RetroCop87> ah
[1:21:54] <Tonicky > No they got rid of that
[1:22:02] <%BoxNavy> DansGame
[1:22:03] <%RetroCop87> I recall flipping loving my phoenix dagger
[1:22:03] <%averyoddjew> on
[1:22:04] <%averyoddjew> oh*
[1:22:08] <%superc37> @patstaresat have you gotten the Suggah word yet pat? its a p good one
[1:22:11] <$Ziegsy> if you think about it, bronzed dog nuts would make tasteful wedding earings for paige
[1:22:13] <%BoxNavy> those spiders are so gross
[1:22:17] <%weissguard> Thankfully the Automata DLC Weapons are great to just carry a playthrough.
[1:22:22] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt Do you remember which weapons are good in Automata? I pretty much jus tbeen using fully upgraded first-weapons the whole time.
[1:22:25] <%Shadowevilkoala> those are the creepiest but least deadly spiders I have ever seen in a game
[1:22:26] <brachydios777> I love that the companions are useful
[1:22:30] <%athuramn> @Ziegsy I like what you just said
[1:22:30] <peyodogo> someone please mod the spiders out jesus christ
[1:22:31] <%LouieRouie> Resident: Emil
[1:22:32] <%Breaknoon> the phoenix weapons are the most grindy to upgrade
[1:22:33] <BlueBiscuitGT> Oh man I just finished Fallen ORder, the spiders there creeped me out
[1:22:34] <%averyoddjew> bye color
[1:22:37] <%RetroCop87> If you do a downed attack on a spider, you burst their egg sac and they spit out baby spiders all over the place
[1:22:40] <+Promessa_EX> what is he implying
[1:22:40] <%Breaknoon> Resi tiem
[1:22:42] <rekinom> Suggon is a pretty strong word
[1:22:43] <Blank9> this part rules
[1:22:43] <Tonicky > got rid of the shoulder charge thing I mean
[1:22:43] <%thetunnelhomer> The best weapon in any Yoko Taro game is IRON WILL.
[1:22:45] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Resident Evil time
[1:22:45] <+SilverDevilfish> Time for the Spencer Mansion
[1:22:49] <%Dakuu75> what a MANSION

[1:23:03] <cardamomo88> the spencer state
[1:23:05] <%ssjklyco> that shades a maniac. Why'd he bite me
[1:23:08] <brachydios777> Definitly RE on purpose
[1:23:09] <JetpackMcQuack> the RE shuffle
[1:23:10] <mr_saturday93> it's also haunted
[1:23:11] <+SilverDevilfish> Emil is a Wesker
[1:23:11] <%superc37> @dakuu75 the beastlord series are p much the highest dmg ones if i remember
[1:23:14] <$Ziegsy> @athuramn Not many do, this is a strange feeling
[1:23:14] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I like how Nier kinda references a lot of other games from a wide variety of genre
[1:23:14] <%Zeikier> best track
[1:23:14] <OkamiDude15> i hope this isnt weiss's blood. he was our old partner ya know
[1:23:15] <%athuramn> I forget why this place be evil
[1:23:16] <SomeAsianDood> welcome to the spencer estate
[1:23:23] <BlueBiscuitGT> I recognise those shots from ur streams
[1:23:25] <%averyoddjew> KAINE NO RUNNING
[1:23:26] <%weissguard> I hope this isn't Kaine's blood!
[1:23:27] <+RealPT1> did he just misgender kaine?
[1:23:29] <%athuramn> @Ziegsy LMFAO
[1:23:34] <JetpackMcQuack> And Kaine can't handle it
[1:23:35] <%Dakuu75> @superc37 oh ok, Sic, thanks.
[1:23:36] <%NitronStreams> why is the choir going so hard?
[1:23:42] <%Breaknoon> "A dining room?!"
[1:23:44] <%OswaldTheDog> the updated music is so fucking amazing for this level
[1:23:49] <%Ranryu692> what a mansion
[1:23:49] <scientiafidem> Wow I thought you were joking but that is actually just the Spencer mansion.
[1:23:51] <soflicar> there is even a secret part of it
[1:23:51] <JetpackMcQuack> I have two speeds: Anime run and sexy
[1:23:53] <%thetunnelhomer> I wonder if the last of the Redfield line is here.
[1:23:55] <Djinnazz> now strike a pose
[1:23:56] <VidulaSaix> Yeah this tracks great
[1:23:57] <peyodogo> kaine said dattebayo
[1:23:57] <brachydios777> Even the movement is slower like RE
[1:23:59] <%MisterRockett> @RealPT1 I think he was referring the Wiess. He wouldn't have expected Kaine since Yonah hasn't met her yet.
[1:23:59] <blackbookalpha> Pat playing Resident Evil again
[1:24:02] <SomeAsianDood> I hope this isn't chris's blood
[1:24:06] <%Breaknoon> wiener lady is cool
[1:24:11] <%ringabal> Kaine, you're staring at the wall...
[1:24:11] <DSD24> Man Niers little jog is hilarious
[1:24:13] <a_mad_dragon_> she naruto runs just to piss people off
[1:24:15] <%Breaknoon> yeah
[1:24:20] <%valriot> Its gay baby time
[1:24:25] <Blank9> it's such a great random homage
[1:24:29] <%RetroCop87> only two camera angles in the dining room, not 5. Unfaithful adaption
[1:24:31] <%Dakuu75> @a_mad_dragon_ fucking, probably
[1:24:32] <OkamiDude15> you can move faster with the light light hold attack
[1:24:32] <+kewlmyc> All it's missing is a door opening animation
[1:24:32] <%BoxNavy> the little baby jog
[1:24:34] <%thetunnelhomer> Music going really hard for no reason.
[1:24:35] <%MisterRockett> @a_mad_dragon_ Does a gay little naruto run just to piss you off.
[1:24:35] <Blank9> and stock door noises
[1:24:35] <+emVulpine> One of the reasons why I wish this game had proper resources is that moments like this really got to shine.
[1:24:39] <%thbluewarden> music is great though
[1:24:43] <+RealPT1> @RealPT1 ok, my bad
[1:24:48] <JetpackMcQuack> This is great the first time
[1:24:51] <UberKingKai> Nier but the re1 directors cut music
[1:24:55] <+skyheys> these portraits are so weird
[1:24:58] <%ringabal> THE DOOR TO DARKNESS??
[1:24:58] <Oxybe> Pat just doing light cardio in the Spencer estate.
[1:24:59] <%RetroCop87> What if that guy is what Yoko Taro looks like under the mask?
[1:25:00] <DSD24> The Darkness Key
[1:25:01] <blackbookalpha> Spencer's Gifts Mansion
[1:25:02] <JetpackMcQuack> yup LUL
[1:25:03] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt Are the painings a refernce to something?
[1:25:04] <+Promessa_EX> just do three hits
[1:25:07] <+Promessa_EX> to go fast
[1:25:08] <Orenjevel> imprisoning me
[1:25:11] <%ssjklyco> I do love the small detail that Weise is afraid of Ghost.
[1:25:13] <%Breaknoon> Vice
[1:25:14] <%valriot> I hate these pictures, its not even like overt but its so unsettling
[1:25:14] <%Kingkaiju0618> cheer2750 pat can I get a shout out to my friend mydixierekt
[1:25:25] <%Breaknoon> no rolling :<
[1:25:35] <OkamiDude15> the hold attack is optimal
[1:25:41] <%Dakuu75> unless Weiss can sense some bull-shit evil-magic or something. Idk why he'd actually be scared
[1:25:41] <+Promessa_EX> btw good time to remove rolling from your skills
[1:25:48] <tengel66> lol
[1:25:49] <%miguelrod777> can't roll indoors but attacking is fine lol
[1:26:00] <%Breaknoon> she's in the john
[1:26:04] <Acicon> hold attacks do more hits when they connect
[1:26:05] <%RetroCop87> fucking Weiss and his ghosts
[1:26:08] <Blank9> I hope this isn't Kaine's blood
[1:26:10] <Mattais88> Wait, if everything grey becasue emile's medusa'd it, are the portraits in colour because he never looks at them?
[1:26:15] <%Dakuu75> she probably went to ransack the armoury
[1:26:17] <arkv01> pat thats racist D:
[1:26:20] <%ssjklyco> Weiss wishes he can .....BOOK it
[1:26:22] <xbb1024> Caus they didn't renew their Audible
[1:26:26] <Tonicky > Love that Wiess is afraid of ghosts
[1:26:29] <%averyoddjew> weiss... you're a floating talking book that kills shades.  WHY ARE YOU AFRAID OF GHOSTS?!
[1:26:29] <Oxybe> Books aren like Children: they're not people.
[1:26:35] <%RetroCop87> I would KILL for a Kaine sandwich
[1:26:42] <+Promessa_EX> i did that too
[1:26:47] <JetpackMcQuack> This is the best
[1:26:48] <brachydios777> To be fair of Weiss, he is literaly magic
[1:26:49] <%Breaknoon> Kaine hot dog :3
[1:26:52] <%Zeikier> fish are like plants
[1:26:55] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:26:57] <%Zeikier> Lord Rydell???
[1:27:02] <datlambo458> Children are fine
[1:27:05] <+RealPT1> after knowing the deep lore it kinda makes sense for wiess to be on edge here
[1:27:09] <%Figleafplays> the fact that you slow walk in this house sucks
[1:27:11] <datlambo458> They get to much hate on the internet
[1:27:11] <%Ranryu692> Pat's a coward who wouldn't tell kids they're stupid in Disco
[1:27:11] <OkamiDude15> tru
[1:27:14] <%RetroCop87> younger siblings are a good metric
[1:27:18] <%athuramn> AS YOU SHOULD BE
[1:27:18] <+Promessa_EX> spooky pictures scare me
[1:27:19] <%psidefx> Samw
[1:27:19] <%NitronStreams> Yup
[1:27:22] <$Ziegsy> Its a cat!
[1:27:22] <JetpackMcQuack> That means you!
[1:27:24] <+fetrigon> yep
[1:27:24] <%NateyBeak> oh whenever a group of teenagers get near me I panic
[1:27:24] <%MisterRockett> I'm 26 and 20 year olds are, like, babies.
[1:27:25] <balthazar758> lol
[1:27:26] <+D00msDayDan> my stupid kid threshold is higher than my own age
[1:27:26] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Cool so you trust me then, I made the cut
[1:27:27] <nevan_44> yeah LUL
[1:27:28] <brachydios777> Boomer
[1:27:28] <%Breaknoon> yeah, zoomers are weird and unpredictable
[1:27:29] <ToneBacas> so it's an age difference to yours?
[1:27:30] <Dragovus> Anyone under 50 is a stupid kid
[1:27:34] <%ssjklyco> Working in customer service the distinction between stupid adult and kid  is very little.
[1:27:35] <%weissguard> psaWink psaWink
[1:27:37] <+Promessa_EX> don't trust anyone over 30 pat!
[1:27:42] <%bigbrothergannon> bigbrothergannon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Dope streamer dope game. Nicccccce.
[1:27:42] <%OswaldTheDog> Absolutely, me too
[1:27:46] <balthazar758> yeah, they sure are
[1:27:51] <mr_saturday93> dumber back then than now!?
[1:27:53] <arkv01> was B)
[1:27:55] <%spitelite> you're still stupide
[1:28:00] <DSD24> I'm 25 right now does that mean I'm weird
[1:28:00] <%Breaknoon> normal shit
[1:28:01] <oda_flobunaga> is the 25  1 year olds or 20 5 year olds
[1:28:02] <%RetroCop87> yeah, that guy kinda deserved it
[1:28:04] <%Zeikier> we're never not revising the drafts on our idiocy
[1:28:04] <SirDogBear> Didnt you start 2BF at age 25? LUL
[1:28:06] <ToneBacas> so what, when you're 50, anyone younger than 35 is dumb?
[1:28:06] <scientiafidem> Doesn't that just mean you are underestimating others because you were dumb?
[1:28:07] <%OswaldTheDog> I was a moron at 25 and I still cringe
[1:28:13] <datlambo458> Youth stupidity is something to be cherished, dumb adults just hurt the soul
[1:28:13] <+Promessa_EX> i'm still not sure when they were using the bows and axes
[1:28:14] <SomeAsianDood> wait how's that possible
[1:28:15] <%BoxNavy> yes :)
[1:28:17] <tattleworm> it's cute that weiss is scared of ghosts
[1:28:18] <maskedmook> I'm 20 and I AM stupid
[1:28:21] <peyodogo> i'm 26 and every single year that passes i feel both stupider and that i was stupider before, it's weird
[1:28:23] <DSD24> Huh
[1:28:23] <Oxybe> As someone Pat's age, yeah. I agree.
[1:28:23] <+RealPT1> I dunno, I kinda felt like I stopped getting smarter at 25
[1:28:24] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> oh that's perfect
[1:28:27] <%Breaknoon> HUGE stupid
[1:28:28] <JetpackMcQuack> There are a lot of stupid old people to be fair
[1:28:35] <%athuramn> 18... 10 years... 25, math checks out
[1:28:35] <Blank9> you'll either think you were stupid, or cringe
[1:28:35] <%Torus1025> torusendor subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 10 month streak!
[1:28:49] <Nupinoop296> i was so FUCKING stupid at 15
[1:28:55] <%JohnAtDawn> Or you could just not be a dumb person?
[1:28:56] <+emVulpine> YEAH, TUTORIAL.
[1:28:57] <+D00msDayDan> and if you're 10 you shouldn't be watching this stream
[1:28:58] <peyodogo> if you're ten, log off twitch you fuckin baby
[1:29:01] <%iShouldBeAtWorklol> this game has quite the atmosphere
[1:29:03] <ammobasket> if you think someone old is dumb, imagine how dumb they would've had to be earlier
[1:29:07] <+D00msDayDan> @JohnAtDawn not an option
[1:29:07] <datlambo458> yeah thats not how that works
[1:29:07] <brachydios777> Life is cringe
[1:29:07] <BeezusHrist> I was pretty smart when I was 25 @PatStaresAt
[1:29:08] <Clundy> I’m 26 and acted like a fuckin shmuck when I was w0
[1:29:08] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[1:29:08] <%MelBrooksKA> I don't feel like I was particularly stupid at 18, more naive tho
[1:29:09] <DSD24> It was more like I was sadder back then at 18
[1:29:09] <SirDogBear> How about the age of old man yelling at clouds? does that increase as you get older? LUL
[1:29:12] <Orenjevel> Okay, maybe i was a *little* dim at 3 years old.
[1:29:12] <BeezusHrist> Speak for yourself...
[1:29:12] <JetpackMcQuack> Hopefully
[1:29:15] <%Zeikier> yeah we're constantly learning and improving
[1:29:19] <%Monkeyweed21> Life is a continuous stream of embarrassment
[1:29:19] <Clundy> 20*
[1:29:22] <%Dakuu75> thanks for that Pat. glad to know I'll never stop going down hill
[1:29:25] <%NitronStreams> OH SHIT

[1:29:33] <%averyoddjew> fuck

[1:29:35] <+fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL
[1:29:37] <%Torus1025> I'm shocked by how dumb I was LAST YEAR
[1:29:38] <DeathByPoke7> LUL

[1:29:45] <DSD24> @Monkeyweed21 That was a Nier Automata quote right?
[1:29:48] <%thetunnelhomer> Wait, how *did* they get in there?
[1:29:48] <+D00msDayDan> that shade's a maniac! why'd he bite me?
[1:29:49] <tengel66> my grandma was dumb, smart
[1:29:54] <arkv01> not but what if they were like an acceptable level of stupid at 12 and are still at the same level at 30
[1:29:56] <SaltyAzteca> Dumb wisdom, just gets better with age!
[1:29:56] <yourliteraldog> Life is about learning, always strive to be less dumb every day
[1:29:56] <Oxybe> Joke's on you, improving is for the strong and i am a weak babby man.
[1:29:59] <%athuramn> I do think the most fascinating thing for adults to do as a thought experiment is to think about your earliest memories and just try and remember how long a 24 hour day was and if you think it feels the same
[1:30:00] <%Shadowevilkoala> there is a weapon here in a box if I remember correctly
[1:30:00] <%ringabal> I wonder what Paige was like in her youth

[1:30:02] <ScreamLord> I forgot about the RE: Noir Mansion
[1:30:02] <%Dakuu75> Ok, that was a good one.

[1:30:07] <scientiafidem> Well Twitter is primarily made up of young people so yeah the youth are pretty fucking stupid.

[1:30:50] <%superc37> probably
[1:30:50] <%averyoddjew> it is not
[1:30:50] <brachydios777> Maybe
[1:30:51] <%za7az> Ya think?
[1:30:52] <ScreamLord> Maybe? That makes sense
[1:30:53] <+bluedude153> yeah???
[1:30:53] <%Ranryu692> "What're ya buyin?"
[1:30:53] <%possumwalsh1221> My sweet gay son
[1:30:53] <mr_saturday93> if he stayed like this then he'd have a much better easier time fighting the aliens
[1:30:55] <%capnbeefs> Finally, the true hero of NieR
[1:30:56] <datlambo458> kinda???
[1:30:56] <Tonicky > could be
[1:30:57] <UberKingKai> Did he just a/s/l you?
[1:30:58] <shieldecho> Hello son
[1:30:58] <%weissguard> Probably not in universe, but I can see it outside.
[1:30:59] <%BoxNavy> i doubt it
[1:31:01] <arkv01> oooh I never thought about that
[1:31:02] <JetpackMcQuack> probably not?
[1:31:02] <%thetunnelhomer> Blindfolds are pretty universal
[1:31:02] <%possumwalsh1221> I had that thought too
[1:31:02] <tattleworm> it's like poetry
[1:31:08] <mai_cu> i mean 2b's blindfold is just papa niers one covered up
[1:31:09] <s__o__u__l_> haHAA "my son"
[1:31:09] <primaryfire> wonder why emil's blindfold isn't a rock
[1:31:11] <datlambo458> cause kaine is a2s insperation in universe
[1:31:12] <%athuramn> hmmm, it would make sense, I don't know anything else in universe that alludes to that kinda imagery
[1:31:13] <arkv01> probably a design choice yeah
[1:31:15] <%SuperFineButtHairs> "i know men's foot steps well ;) "
[1:31:16] <Astrophizz> almost certainly
[1:31:19] <%PkSilent01> Are we going to do timeskip this stream?
[1:31:22] <%possumwalsh1221> Maybe like carried over over time and they don’t even know why anymore
[1:31:22] <LordOfThePoultry> monkaS
[1:31:27] <JetpackMcQuack> I think Taro thinks blindfolds are cool
[1:31:30] <+SavageMonkeyDonger> i think it was just sexy so they made them blindfolded
[1:31:38] <Nupinoop296> OHHH
[1:31:47] <+SavageMonkeyDonger> that's why emil has the blindfold
[1:31:49] <%athuramn> so he's never looked in a mirror?
[1:31:50] <arkv01> I'm sorry its my eyes, anything I look at becomes stone hard :)
[1:31:55] <%athuramn> not even out of curiosity?
[1:32:00] <%BoxNavy> B)
[1:32:00] <%Breaknoon> that ONE GUY in Drakengard was blind too
[1:32:02] <yourliteraldog> Like the cyclops
[1:32:03] <Blank9> yeah they just wanted to make sexy androids
[1:32:03] <Nupinoop296> Cyclops visor
[1:32:04] <LunarRemix> It wouldn't look sad
[1:32:05] <Ethel9727> What if he just turned the sunglasses to stone?
[1:32:07] <+CookieCutter007> LUL the music is a bit overbearing
[1:32:07] <%valriot> Cool Emil
[1:32:08] <CSeriesJTYPE> emil is basically cyclops
[1:32:09] <+D00msDayDan> optic BLAST
[1:32:10] <+Bricespresso> look like dumb cyclops?
[1:32:10] <cardamomo88> THE COOLER EMIL
[1:32:10] <JetpackMcQuack> Take it down to 20% petrified
[1:32:14] <%ringabal> Emil with Wesker shades: Choice
[1:32:14] <DSD24> @Breaknoon Leonard right?
[1:32:15] <%SuperFineButtHairs> MAP
[1:32:16] <%thelaxinator> sunglasses turn to stone, innit?
[1:32:16] <illtima> Sure, Pat Gets Stared At
[1:32:16] <SirDogBear> Like Cyclops PogChamp
[1:32:16] <datlambo458> but then hed be cyclops and nobody wants to be cyclops
[1:32:19] <%RetroCop87> Give Emil some Naruto goggles, then he can ninja run with Kaine
[1:32:21] <a_mad_dragon_> WHY ISN'T THE BLINDFOLD STONE
[1:32:21] <%thelaxinator> can't see through stone sunglasses
[1:32:22] <%Dakuu75> let me jsut give these strangers the map and keys to the house. no worries
[1:32:25] <shieldecho> Are there even REGULAR glasses in the post apocalypse
[1:32:26] <%MisterRockett> If your house needs a map you're an asshole
[1:32:26] <+Kduff89> I... I think blindfolds are cool
[1:32:26] <arkv01> emil, lead him to the sexy dungeon
[1:32:27] <%superc37> @cookiecutter007 good it should be
[1:32:27] <Mattais88> Would RayBan survive the apocalyse?
[1:32:27] <tengel66> kind of like Cyclops
[1:32:28] <%ssjklyco> the fact that the Butler never returned and you had to find Email, means the Butler wan't going to find him in the first place
[1:32:29] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt Like those sunglasses Cyclops wears?
[1:32:32] <CSeriesJTYPE> complete. global. fossilization
[1:32:32] <%SuperFineButtHairs> jeeeeze
[1:32:32] <%Breaknoon> @DSD24 Yes
[1:32:34] <oda_flobunaga> His name comes from 映見る, Emiru, to look/reflect
[1:32:35] <%za7az> Why doesn't the blindfold turn to stone? LUL
[1:32:37] <%thelaxinator> Blindfolds at least keep your eyes closed
[1:32:41] <+gitgouda> waiting for a zombie to poke out and for him to bust out ashotgun
[1:32:43] <+zzNamttamzz> I like the stupid mask
[1:32:43] <%averyoddjew> but he's right
[1:32:45] <DSD24> These Shades can't hurt me these shades are Gucci
[1:32:53] <+BIumen> why is this here again
[1:32:54] <yourliteraldog> Kaine's fat fucking meat emporium
[1:32:55] <%Broken_Sonex> @za7az Shhhhhh
[1:33:00] <%Monkeyweed21> @za7az the blindfold keeps his eyes closed
[1:33:05] <+emVulpine> @za7az Yoko Taro be like, "It's magic, I ain't gotta explain shit"
[1:33:06] <+Promessa_EX> yeah
[1:33:06] <%SuperFineButtHairs> psaFist psaFist psaFist damn it
[1:33:15] <%athuramn> If you keep your eyes closed for a decade and never open them, do you even have the muscle function to be able to open them anymore without rehab
[1:33:23] <tattleworm> spooks incoming
[1:33:25] <mr_saturday93> you never find out who's talking
[1:33:28] <%averyoddjew> i like how the cries for help are never explained
[1:33:29] <yourliteraldog> Wait is this place grey because emil turned it to stone
[1:33:29] <blackbookalpha> Blindfold not alive
[1:33:32] <JetpackMcQuack> that's thejumpscare
[1:33:39] <%capnbeefs> Yep
[1:33:52] <DSD24> I forgot to download them
[1:33:53] <oda_flobunaga> Early game yes
[1:33:54] <%RetroCop87> they stay super good if you don't use magic very often
[1:33:54] <tattleworm> they don't get any matk bonuses but the patk's solid, yeah
[1:33:55] <%averyoddjew> but they give no magic power
[1:33:57] <%za7az> @emVulpine This explanation makes the most sense  Kappa
[1:33:59] <%weissguard> They'll do.
[1:34:00] <%valriot> Theyre good for early
[1:34:00] <%BoxNavy> D:
[1:34:01] <datlambo458> spoopy
[1:34:03] <%capnbeefs> They busted
[1:34:05] <DSD24> ITS BLOOD
[1:34:06] <%Breaknoon> yay blood
[1:34:07] <%ringabal> WUZ THAT SMELL
[1:34:08] <%Shadowevilkoala> pheonix spear is still the best by far
[1:34:08] <JetpackMcQuack> D:
[1:34:10] <datlambo458> ohhh noooooo
[1:34:12] <TheLemuroid> When upgraded they have the highest attack but no magic
[1:34:12] <Oxybe> Koolaid fountain? Noice.
[1:34:13] <datlambo458> bwooood
[1:34:14] <Orenjevel> wtf is wrong with emils house
[1:34:15] <brachydios777> Only downside is weak Magic
[1:34:17] <maskedmook> they give no magic boost so just worse
[1:34:18] <shieldecho> I've been playing with Virtuous Contact for like the entire game and I'm almost done with Route A
[1:34:19] <Tonicky > tomato soup sink
[1:34:19] <%capnbeefs> It’s blood
[1:34:21] <%templar010> this haunted house bullshit kekW
[1:34:23] <SaltyAzteca> Gasped!
[1:34:23] <%BoxNavy> you had to get spooked by the blood before you could leave
[1:34:27] <%valriot> But soon as Part2 starts, you fucking SPRINT to Facade to jerk off on the Pheonix Spear
[1:34:29] <%RetroCop87> large gears are a pain to farm
[1:34:29] <%Breaknoon> all the bathrooms in the mansion dont have toilets
[1:34:30] <%Shadowevilkoala> well except twohanded swords are extremely good for guard breaking
[1:34:40] <blackbookalpha> DLC weapons have easier upgrade ingredients
[1:34:44] <tattleworm> black pearl ptsd
[1:34:49] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt I'd save the grinding till Routeb B, saves a lot of time.
[1:34:51] <%valriot> Beastlord is really good as well
[1:34:52] <%SuperFineButtHairs> "ive done a slight bit of grinding off screen"
[1:34:53] <+emVulpine> Eventually my go-to in this game was to knock Shades over and execute them.
[1:34:59] <yourliteraldog> I'd like to see Yako Taro make harvest moon
[1:35:04] <oda_flobunaga> There is a great sword you get for the secret dungeon that is absurdly powerful
[1:35:04] <blackbookalpha> black pearl and eagle eggs are chore
[1:35:05] <DSD24> The two handers are way cooler in this game
[1:35:06] <%Breaknoon> black pearl and eagle egg PTSD
[1:35:06] <+emVulpine> Until I hit the point where I could take them down with only a couple hits.
[1:35:10] <%Dakuu75> lol
[1:35:16] <%iShouldBeAtWorklol> the shades remind me of the enemies in ico (PS2)
[1:35:20] <roboyuji> The butler being an android makes so much more sense after Automata.
[1:35:25] <%RetroCop87> I love how this guy is just never explained
[1:35:25] <JetpackMcQuack> there'll probably be a lot of that
[1:35:26] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> It's cute when Weiss is freaking out
[1:35:26] <%BoxNavy> the black pearls arent too bad to get
[1:35:27] <%ssjklyco> "Sir, I was not doing my job and just standig here
[1:35:28] <Tonicky > I don't get this bit lol
[1:35:36] <yourliteraldog> lol
[1:35:36] <%weissguard> Emil making the jokes
[1:35:38] <mr_saturday93> he's not

[1:35:57] <%templar010> ...Android?
[1:35:59] <JetpackMcQuack> Good wingman
[1:36:01] <primaryfire> the butler being an android makes sense if he's to stay here and watch emil for a thousand years
[1:36:01] <%superc37> i think this is meant to imply that the butlers a robutt
[1:36:02] <maskedmook> I think he's an Android

[1:40:07] <LordOfThePoultry> yep very evil :)
[1:40:07] <%BoxNavy> they are so dark and evil
[1:40:07] <%averyoddjew> doing finishers on knocked down enemies is extremely busted
[1:40:16] <%SuperFineButtHairs> talking is for nerds
[1:40:16] <%livlinn> NotLikeThis
[1:40:16] <Ethel9727> The only good shade is a dead shade
[1:40:18] <Djinnazz> @Mangahero18 it goes
[1:40:18] <%RetroCop87> Pat, have you been using Dark Whirlwind for group management?
[1:40:19] <KungFooMaen> FeelsBadMan
[1:40:21] <+emVulpine> To be fair, Nier literally can't talk to them.
[1:40:22] <tattleworm> couldn't if you wanted to to be fair
[1:40:23] <+SilverDevilfish> Gotta kill them all. Especially the round ones that make baby sounds Kappa
[1:40:24] <%Breaknoon> never talk to police
[1:40:26] <yourliteraldog> These shades have don't know what it means to be human.
[1:40:27] <DSD24> @averyoddjew Its also brutal as hell
[1:40:31] <%captain_thickthighs> Here once again to $!mp.  As another fellow comie I just wanted to share my copo meeting from this week. Supervisor says the staff isn't interested enough in the work and I quote " You are not here for travel benefits and health insurance but to work for (company name)". That morning an employee was applying for finical assistances. Plus one guy just quit three days later after using all his vacation and sabbatical days up first. I feel this is what the titanic felt like.
[1:40:35] <Saltmeisterr> No talk, only K I L L
[1:40:36] <+itsgundamu> this music SourPls SourPls SourPls
[1:40:36] <LunarRemix> They must've tried to communicate at first, right?
[1:40:38] <+D00msDayDan> @averyoddjew oh yeah i forgot about finishers until i got to route B, they're crazy good for armored enemies
[1:40:40] <BlueBiscuitGT> FeelsNierMan
[1:40:43] <+karmahoudini_guitar> Dark Whirlwind is great
[1:40:47] <%Ranryu692> don't talk to them, don't shake their hands. don't even looka t them

[1:42:22] <JetpackMcQuack> Grimoire Meh
[1:42:22] <Ethel9727> Pat, did you ever read the collection of short stories from Grimoire NieR? They're on the wiki for free
[1:42:22] <tattleworm> rubrum a bitch
[1:42:26] <%MisterRockett> Weiss' Girlfriend that he doesn't remember.
[1:42:27] <+D00msDayDan> i didn't even know that was its name

[1:42:36] <yourliteraldog> BOOK BURNING
[1:42:36] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[1:42:38] <%RetroCop87> surprised they never added Rubrum's novel backstory to the game
[1:42:41] <%NitronStreams> Man I forget so much if the middle of this game
[1:42:44] <OkamiDude15> @Reddhero12 he'll do it all pretty sure. and if not you could always watch the old lp he did of the og a couple years back
[1:42:44] <+RyTYoung> Grimoire Nice shotoEww
[1:42:45] <VidulaSaix> Rubrum's a girl if I recall
[1:42:45] <mr_saturday93> FUN FACT that's wiess old friend that he doesn't remember
[1:42:46] <DSD24> @Reddhero12 Just as bad as stopping at Ending A in Nier Automata
[1:42:46] <+emVulpine> They're apparently releasing Grimoire Nier in English.
[1:42:50] <datlambo458> Yeah this is one of the most fucked up side stories
[1:42:53] <%MisterRockett> @Promessa_EX *she
[1:43:06] <%captain_thickthighs> Yep i had to vent im now being trained for operations and they want people to "voulenteer" for another admin role. Im just waiting out till i can cash out
[1:43:18] <Mangahero18> Is pat using those OP Automata weapons?
[1:43:22] <+Jack8274> Did you just assume this books gender? Gheeze
[1:43:22] <%Torus1025> They never even QUESTION this book's existence
[1:43:26] <LordOfThePoultry> yup
[1:43:33] <OkamiDude15> @VidulaSaix yup the one weiss tried to help during the experiment
[1:43:38] <%averyoddjew> they slow down damage to make sure dialogue gets out, so don't worry about killing too quickly
[1:43:39] <%Dakuu75> ok...
[1:43:39] <%athuramn> emil's putting a lot of trust in the fact that he won't just accidentally glance at nier in this chaos
[1:43:47] <%Monkeyweed21> ORB
[1:43:53] <Mangahero18> What happened to not using them like you said in the first stream Mr. Luke Boiven?
[1:43:56] <%BoxNavy> oh hey
[1:43:57] <datlambo458> man i feel bad for weiss, he dosent even remember
[1:43:58] <%LouieRouie> Rubrum's protection is ready to roll

[1:45:07] <%BoxNavy> YOU BASTARDS
[1:45:09] <%Torus1025> These dialogue bits can be so fucking funny when you're overleveled
[1:45:11] <+Jack8274> Still legal in the Aerie

[1:45:25] <%SuperFineButtHairs> did they rerecord the VO?
[1:45:29] <%livlinn> Kaine best shiaLove
[1:45:29] <+Promessa_EX> is anything legal in the aeire?
[1:45:39] <%captain_thickthighs> Anime game ages are weird
[1:45:40] <tattleworm> they make you do reduced damage until the voice acting's done in bosses now @PatStaresAt
[1:45:40] <+karmahoudini_guitar> yeah they re-recorded all the VO
[1:45:41] <%Hilleltaco> @SuperFineButtHairs Yes
[1:45:48] <LordOfThePoultry> rip

[1:46:00] <%ringabal> Is that the script?
[1:46:01] <%Dakuu75> I think it's odd that, that book didn't talk, once.
[1:46:03] <+Promessa_EX> thanks for the loot book
[1:46:03] <%superc37> @superfinebutthairs well given how nierman is a young boy in this game, yes
[1:46:04] <+evbites> @Promessa_EX trowing rocks at kaine
[1:46:05] <%athuramn> to make the creepiness age appropro
[1:46:08] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt carefull with you weapon selection for the upcoming section, the virtuous weapons can melt through the boss encounters and skip dialogue
[1:46:11] <%GalacticaPhanto> @djinnazz she's sort of super dead
[1:46:14] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[1:46:15] <cydalei> not Fahrenheit 451...
[1:46:17] <datlambo458> @brachydios777 its like how jotaro is 17 but is functionally not
[1:46:19] <%captain_thickthighs> @tattleworm That seems kinda pretentious
[1:46:19] <dan_g_v> sounds legit
[1:46:20] <%Dakuu75> no shut up, though Pat
[1:46:22] <arkv01> get lucky B)
[1:46:29] <SaltyAzteca> shhhhhhhhhhhh
[1:46:29] <%weissguard> YEYEYE, it's the good sealed verse
[1:46:31] <DSD24> Dark Whirlwind is great for farming Scorpions in the Desert
[1:46:32] <EternalJedi> RetroCop87 you can't melt bosses past dialogue
[1:46:36] <%Monkeyweed21> yea that one is amazing
[1:46:36] <SaltyAzteca> its fiiiiiine
[1:46:39] <%Agami23> do you think its in code, or just in old world english?
[1:46:39] <%athuramn> KEEP YOUR BLINDFOLD ON, NO ONE WANTS YOU READING EMIL
[1:46:40] <%superc37> LUCKY TED STRIKES AGAINE
[1:46:41] <%RetroCop87> SHUT UP PS3
[1:46:46] <+BIumen> they should not have settled the camera on this dude for so long

[1:46:48] <+skyheys> Se BASED ian
[1:46:49] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt I always too it as the whole book is on petrification research and the page simply had the title in the header
[1:46:49] <+karmahoudini_guitar> Kirk Thornton
[1:46:49] <Mattais88> Some kind of code, how ever will we figure out this Pig Latin?
[1:46:49] <LunarRemix> Man the NPCs still look like crap
[1:46:53] <tattleworm> even if it takes like 5 years
[1:46:59] <%BoxNavy> he looks like the battle pass
[1:47:00] <brachydios777> Cause her being 17 makes stuff with Papa Nier wierd
[1:47:02] <%averyoddjew> yes
[1:47:05] <%Dakuu75> @skyheys ugh... lol
[1:47:07] <yourliteraldog> Black Butler refrence?
[1:47:08] <ultimate_joker_main> @tattleworm allowing you to not miss dialogue is pretentious? wtf
[1:47:08] <%SuperFineButtHairs> @superc37 i thought they used the same VO but added one for brother Nier.
[1:47:08] <ScreamLord> And it's the most butler name ever
[1:47:09] <%Breaknoon> cool part
[1:47:09] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[1:47:11] <DaKnightWarrior> He does.
[1:47:16] <Oxybe> of course thr butlet is called Sebastian.
[1:47:17] <lemon_lover28> Sebastion is almost more stereotypical than Jeeves
[1:47:18] <HeroToxiko> @tattleworm people kept doing damage and made others miss lore so, yeah
[1:47:20] <yourliteraldog> Molest
[1:47:21] <%Torus1025> S36AS710N
[1:47:22] <%RetroCop87> @EternalJedi you can absolutely skip Weiss/Nier in-battle dialogue
[1:47:22] <arkv01> give emil a taste of mama milkers
[1:47:23] <Mattais88> Awww

[1:47:51] <SaltyAzteca> BibleThump
[1:47:51] <%Ranryu692> Kainé's the best
[1:47:55] <%Dakuu75> Kaine, giving us the real morals on, not body-shaming \
[1:47:59] <HeroToxiko> BibleThump
[1:48:01] <%capnbeefs> Kaine, he’s just a boy
[1:48:05] <ScreamLord> Her leg too
[1:48:07] <+karmahoudini_guitar> yes, Yonah and Kainé were given higher ages in Gestalt (on paper, nothing in game was changed)
[1:48:07] <%thedankestmeeme> this is the traditional ONEE chan moment
[1:48:08] <%possumwalsh1221> She’s the best BibleThump
[1:48:10] <%BoxNavy> look at that small child
[1:48:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> Quarry Whore magic!
[1:48:12] <JetpackMcQuack> :( aw jeez

[1:48:23] <%ringabal> Thanks, Velvet
[1:48:24] <%Breaknoon> ;_;
[1:48:24] <EternalJedi> RetroCop87 I 100%d Replicant 1.22, every instance of in battle dialogue was accompanied by doing chip damage to the enemy till the dialogue was done
[1:48:25] <%athuramn> she's like a gigantes
[1:48:26] <%BoxNavy> the audio mixing here is not good
[1:48:26] <%AllenDeadman> Kaine is the best
[1:48:29] <SirCacaPee> PAT I LOVE YOU
[1:48:33] <+karmahoudini_guitar> DSD?
[1:48:35] <%captain_thickthighs> Is this good writing or just flowery?
[1:48:35] <oda_flobunaga> now kith
[1:48:46] <mass1997> the sound mixing is bad in this scene
[1:48:47] <+itsgundamu> @captain_thickthighs yes
[1:48:47] <+RyTYoung> noooo
[1:48:51] <datlambo458> good writing
[1:48:52] <%za7az> "You want me to stick it in WHERE?!"
[1:48:53] <+skyheys> @athuramn they slimmed her model down in the remaster, she used to be less lanky
[1:48:54] <yourliteraldog> But it's not easy access tho, you would rip the cups open
[1:48:55] <+emVulpine> It's melodramatic writing and I'm a sucker for it.
[1:48:55] <%athuramn> if you like it, then the former @captain_thickthighs
[1:48:57] <%Breaknoon> ;_;
[1:49:03] <BeezusHrist> @karmahoudini_guitar differences in sexual development. A

[1:49:03] <yourliteraldog> Ew Straight
[1:49:05] <%RetroCop87> @EternalJedi I'm on route C, and I dunno what to say other than I HAVE skipped dialogue
[1:49:05] <%weissguard> She whispered that we're never getting Bayonetta 3
[1:49:08] <%SuperFineButtHairs> how does her bra thingy even work?
[1:49:09] <Mangahero18> Kaine is whispering in his ear "I saw you looking at Nier's ass yu sus"
[1:49:11] <%ringabal> "Wait, you're part BOY!? COME BACK!!"
[1:49:16] <%psidefx> Just side character things
[1:49:20] <DSD24> Elden Ring never exists

[1:49:38] <OkamiDude15> @YakumoYomi you could always change it in the settings
[1:49:39] <arkv01> she whispered "i'm already banging niers ass :) "
[1:49:42] <+karmahoudini_guitar> Kainé's theme is so good
[1:49:45] <+emVulpine> "Not until you appreciate how much of a jerk I am!"
[1:49:57] <yourliteraldog> Kaine I'm sorry but he is fan of cock

[1:50:28] <DSD24> Summon Chairs like Vegil
[1:50:30] <uncledoodsauce> nier needs more power
[1:50:31] <%iwa5h4ck3d> Become as Beyblades
[1:50:33] <%averyoddjew> it's not as good in the remake, sadly
[1:50:39] <%Ranryu692> did they add new spells, or does my memory just suck?
[1:50:41] <mudapersona> shoot and it expands
[1:50:46] <+BIumen> it pushes stuff away which is a pain kinda
[1:50:47] <%RoboticAnimeDude> So this is where nier starts to be nier, and I love this fucking song

[1:50:54] <oda_flobunaga> Phantasm is fantastic though
[1:50:55] <%BoxNavy> you might as well use dark wall and wail on everything consequence free
[1:51:04] <+skyheys> @ranryu692 same number, they're just more useful now
[1:51:04] <+Promessa_EX> hmm i never saw aug 31 diary
[1:51:05] <tattleworm> whirlwind's amazing if you stick paralyze on it
[1:51:06] <Mangahero18> So the Replicants all get cloned and constantly reborn but what about Emil? He's a modified human...is he just immortal? What about the butler? Android?
[1:51:07] <%Breaknoon> HERE WE GO
[1:51:09] <brachydios777> Whirlwind is good, phantom is cooler
[1:51:10] <mr_saturday93> it does stagger them good
[1:51:12] <soflicar> whirlwind is great as a defensive spell
[1:51:15] <Djinnazz> @Ranryu692 nope
[1:51:19] <+RyTYoung> yh

[1:51:37] <%Torus1025> What a nice sister
[1:51:38] <OkamiDude15> dark wall full charge is pretty good

[1:51:41] <%SuperFineButtHairs> lovely town
[1:51:42] <%Breaknoon> it would be a shame if...
[1:51:47] <%RetroCop87> well, most of it will be explained
[1:51:47] <+emVulpine> "What a nice town, hope nothing bad happens to it."
[1:51:48] <%Dakuu75> WTF DOES SHE EVEN HAVE?!
[1:51:49] <yourliteraldog> Be a shame if anything bad happened
[1:51:49] <datlambo458> look at this pan shot that definitly does not imply anything bad
[1:51:52] <%NitronStreams> I sure hope nothing bad happens
[1:51:52] <%ringabal> Be a REAL SHAME
[1:51:52] <Tonicky > Game reminding us of our peaceful home for no reason
[1:51:53] <%LouieRouie> I hope nobody steals my tarts
[1:51:55] <%possumwalsh1221> What a lovely place I bet nothing bad could ever happen here :)
[1:51:56] <%spitelite> i bet nothing bad will EVER happen
[1:51:57] <+BIumen> they remade this game just for this shot of the blanket
[1:51:57] <%RetroCop87> some of it will be explained in a stage play
[1:51:57] <+Promessa_EX> blanket pog
[1:51:57] <+karmahoudini_guitar> Yonah looks like a weird bird
[1:51:58] <+SilverDevilfish> Sure hope a dark colossus doesn't destroy all
[1:52:01] <shieldecho> Weird how we're getting this picturesque shot of the town. I hope nothing bad happens to it.
[1:52:04] <%thedankestmeeme> nothing bad happens here smile
[1:52:05] <Mangahero18> @RetroCop87 Lol no it wont. Dont fucking like Retrocop this is a Taro joint. Literally NONE of it will be explained in the actual game.
[1:52:07] <%BoxNavy> no :)
[1:52:07] <%cvp5127> but suddenly the fire nation attacked
[1:52:08] <+zzNamttamzz> Life will go on like this forever... FOREVER
[1:52:11] <+fetrigon> EZ
[1:52:11] <RiverBirch> Nope
[1:52:13] <sosuke5> Look at that bed sheet tech
[1:52:13] <%shurtal> no

[1:52:17] <+RyTYoung> VoteNay
[1:52:17] <DudeDern> I can tell chat wants to spoil something but I don’t know what it is
[1:52:18] <%SuperFineButtHairs> no

[1:52:19] <%RetroCop87> "... yay..."

[1:52:25] <peyodogo> nothing bad will happen :)
[1:52:27] <%solracc25> Imouto chan
[1:52:29] <%BoxNavy> yes :)
[1:52:31] <RiverBirch> I will
[1:52:31] <%SuperFineButtHairs> i already do
[1:52:32] <Jediforce317> Stop lying, Nier. Bad brother
[1:52:32] <+emVulpine> If any of y'all thought this game had odd cutscene choices, Drakengard 1 is on a whole other level.
[1:52:33] <+fetrigon> IT'S GONNA MAKE EVERYONE BETTER KomodoHype
[1:52:35] <+skyheys> HE IS
[1:52:36] <%captain_thickthighs> Im a child in a japanese story. Its not gonna go well
[1:52:36] <yourliteraldog> No but I'll ruin everything for everyone forever
[1:52:41] <%RetroCop87> what a Japanese worry
[1:52:43] <balthazar758> anime cough
[1:52:43] <Blank9> too late, my butthole's already torn
[1:52:46] <+RyTYoung> Depends how much worse your cooking gets YONAH
[1:52:47] <arkv01> absolute, I'm off to marry kaine and ride off into the sunset
[1:52:48] <+skyheys> HE RESENTS HER SO FUCKING MUCH
[1:52:50] <mr_saturday93> it's not a disease dumb child
[1:52:58] <%Dakuu75> yep
[1:53:02] <%BoxNavy> silent hill 2 was all about that
[1:53:05] <HeroToxiko> FACTS
[1:53:06] <datlambo458> i mean he kinda does in the side material
[1:53:07] <yourliteraldog> Yep
[1:53:10] <shieldecho> *smothers her with a pillow James Sunderland style*
[1:53:20] <%SuperFineButtHairs> Like Lupus? ;)
[1:53:20] <%AllenDeadman> it's fucking horrible yes
[1:53:21] <mr_saturday93> damn did t know that
[1:53:26] <+Promessa_EX> nier in particular is always out doing things for her and she feels guilty about it
[1:53:28] <+rainlily1245> really tragic shit
[1:53:28] <%athuramn> psychology made me depressed
[1:53:32] <Blank9> I wonder what nier would think about james sunderland
[1:53:32] <HeroToxiko> i used to be a part time caretaker, shit gats really sad
[1:53:34] <MrLastChanceLearns> oh yeah, that stuff sadly breeds resetnment
[1:53:42] <Mangahero18> I would definitely resent any family members I had to take care of...resent them SO HARD.
[1:53:46] <HeroToxiko> gets*
[1:53:47] <+emVulpine> Just going by the game's story, I don't feel like Nier resents Yonah for being sick.
[1:53:48] <%RetroCop87> that sounds rough on the spirit
[1:53:51] <%SuperFineButtHairs> poor mustard queen
[1:53:54] <yourliteraldog> Emotial Capcity
[1:53:56] <SaltyAzteca> "I wasted my whole life because of you!" Or something
[1:53:59] <+rainlily1245> after so many years of doing it, it can grate and break people down
[1:54:04] <%Agami23> my brother has a long term illness, im glad im around to help him because my family isnt exactly the best for it.
[1:54:05] <+emVulpine> But Yonah definitely wishes he'd just stay home, and he doesn't realize that enough.
[1:54:06] <%iwa5h4ck3d> So Pat = Young Nier
[1:54:06] <sosuke5> @PatStaresAt Have you been cultivating your moonflowers?
[1:54:09] <Blank9> they sunderland it
[1:54:11] <MrLastChanceLearns> it wears ya down
[1:54:13] <datlambo458> The big thing about brother nier is that he kinda hates that he is a care taker, but to cope he created a complex out of it
[1:54:18] <%BoxNavy> DAMN
[1:54:18] <CSeriesJTYPE> people who need long term care also commonly feel like theyre a burden on the people around them
[1:54:19] <%athuramn> there is also a thing called caregiver burnout which can happen even to those who care
[1:54:20] <VidulaSaix> Gottem

[1:54:45] <%Torus1025> Let's GOOOOOO
[1:54:46] <+karmahoudini_guitar> I'm sure there could be a small part of Nier that feels like it is a burden, it's only natural for humans. but overall, he loves Yonah and wouldn't abandon her
[1:54:47] <+notgarza> Rip
[1:54:51] <primaryfire> hope nothing bad happens when you collect the moss
[1:54:51] <%ringabal> "Vapor Moss" THATS JUST WEED

[1:55:34] <nevan_44> wow
[1:55:35] <datlambo458> @karmahoudini_guitar Yoko is on record saying that brother nier would chose route d to get out of taking care of yonah
[1:55:36] <%athuramn> that's a really shitty thing to do
[1:55:37] <Mangahero18> I used a trainer on PC and gave myself all the seeds to side skip all that cross breeding nonsense.

[1:55:49] <HeroToxiko> in sickness AND not or LUL
[1:55:51] <sosuke5> "but mainly in health though"
[1:55:52] <%BoxNavy> they mean sick as in cool
[1:55:52] <Ethel9727> Well except with Pat and Paige, they're just doing in sickness.
[1:55:53] <%averyoddjew> "til death do us part"
[1:55:54] <+rainlily1245> betraying oaths is actually the worst
[1:55:54] <%shurtal> In sickness and in health, and in food theft
[1:55:55] <%athuramn> "Nah, I only want you in health, hoe"
[1:55:57] <balthazar758> guy couldn't even fucking do that
[1:55:58] <$Ziegsy> Why does paige have a kitten???
[1:56:01] <mr_saturday93> Ppl don't care! sadly
[1:56:04] <%SuperFineButtHairs> "till one of us fucking dies like a bitch"
[1:56:07] <LordOfThePoultry> yeyeyey here we go
[1:56:08] <+fetrigon> atleast they didn't have a kid together
[1:56:10] <BlueLunecy> It hasn't been 10 minutes little dude
[1:56:11] <shieldecho> My mom EXPECTED my dad to leave her when she got cancer and was surprised when he didn't
[1:56:11] <%BoxNavy> he died
[1:56:12] <Tonicky > oh no our boy!
[1:56:13] <%ssjklyco> Marriage is sacred. Except when you want to leave.
[1:56:13] <Mangahero18> Yet another reason why marriage is nonsense. Never commit to anything ever.
[1:56:14] <%captain_thickthighs> I would repesct shallow ass vow though just for the honesty
[1:56:14] <%Maids4lyfe> IF YOU'RE NOT DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS YOU DON'T DESERVE THEM WHEN THEY'RE HEALTHY
[1:56:15] <BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt What if lupus dude wants to have kids? Should he have kids with lupus chick and risk them getting lupus, too?
[1:56:16] <primaryfire> oh no something bad happened when you collected the moss
[1:56:17] <+karmahoudini_guitar> @datlambo458  then why does Nier go through all the trouble of trying to save her
[1:56:20] <%RetroCop87> My Dad had to deal with my mother's terminal cancer, and that shit gets rough, but you stick with them because holy shit
[1:56:21] <MagicMongoose> here we go
[1:56:23] <peyodogo> i get being overwhelmed and not having the kind of temperament to safely take care of someone, but that's fucking cruel
[1:56:24] <Tonicky > street nap
[1:56:25] <+emVulpine> Sometimes you have to do what you have to do, but if he divorced her right at diagnosis, that's a really awful thing to do.
[1:56:26] <%BoxNavy> he actually just keeled over
[1:56:31] <nevan_44> he sleep
[1:56:39] <%Arek_1> It's weird, Pat said something before "health." Huh, oh well. Kappa
[1:56:41] <+fetrigon> sleepy
[1:56:41] <OkamiDude15> emil came to warn us of the british
[1:56:48] <+emVulpine> A friend of mine's parents were about to divorce when his mother died, after being ill for years and with other issues. I don't blame his father for realizing he couldn't handle it anymore.
[1:56:48] <+Promessa_EX> this is one of those spots where you have to imagine it's been longer than 10 minutes since you left teh mansion
[1:56:50] <+evbites> does the music sound warped
[1:56:53] <Tonicky > Emils wild walk
[1:56:54] <yourliteraldog> Vows are only legally binding before god, so if you plan on going to hell...
[1:57:01] <%RetroCop87> "Emil, are you tripping?"
[1:57:01] <%SuperFineButtHairs> what
[1:57:02] <%captain_thickthighs> do you sir ride or die for this bitch, i do
[1:57:07] <+fetrigon> Kreygasm
[1:57:08] <+BIumen> i feel like the game could have used a story quest between this and the mansion because it's like emil just followed you home
[1:57:10] <yourliteraldog> Emil took some bad acid

[1:57:37] <%BoxNavy> :)
[1:57:38] <datlambo458> @karmahoudini_guitar He creates a complex out of it to cope with the fact that its the right thing to do. At some point the goal of saving her overcomes her desire for happiness (all she wants from him is time and attention which he dosent give when looking for a cure)
[1:57:38] <mr_saturday93> THRY NEED TK SHOW THIS

[1:58:48] <%BoxNavy> we dont know if she can fight :)
[1:58:49] <%Breaknoon> @2DSuperiority this, but new one is fine
[1:58:51] <Mangahero18> Bible Black? What does porn have to do with anything?
[1:58:52] <mr_saturday93> I wonder if the Knave is relapsed or is willing attacking
[1:58:55] <tattleworm> how would she fight? she's a helpless minstrel
[1:58:55] <sosuke5> but she can't fight, she's a girl
[1:58:55] <RiverBirch> She's a medicine woman
[1:58:57] <%weissguard> Almost like they're trying to guide you to do the thing towards the other thing.
[1:58:57] <brachydios777> hmmmmmmmmm
[1:58:58] <HeroToxiko> OR we could let them destroy the village hmmm

[1:59:10] <+Promessa_EX> it's odd because she clearly has a unique weapon
[1:59:12] <%BoxNavy> Gebo

[1:59:13] <HeroToxiko> *ullulates in anime*

[1:59:27] <+emVulpine> It's a deliberate, planned attack.
[1:59:28] <+BIumen> Okay so is it Jack or Knave
[1:59:28] <%averyoddjew> FUCK YOUR GATE
[1:59:28] <VidulaSaix> Hey, it's that boss from the critically acclaimed Final Fantasy XIV!
[1:59:29] <%MisterRockett> What makes you think Devola can fight? She's just a bard xD
[1:59:30] <Nupinoop296> OH HIM
[1:59:31] <mr_saturday93> that's Knave
[1:59:31] <ExpressNode> Its the Titan shade breaking down the wall

[1:59:34] <%ringabal> OH GOD THE TITANS
[1:59:34] <%GalacticaPhanto> Oh whaddup Jack
[1:59:36] <%psidefx> psaBig BOI
[1:59:37] <Tonicky > It's Jackie
[1:59:37] <+D00msDayDan> jack baker
[1:59:37] <peyodogo> i mean a BRD alone doesn't have the dps to deal with that shit
[1:59:40] <%SuperFineButtHairs> big boiii
[1:59:40] <%athuramn> my question is, WHERE DID THIS COME FROM. This threat is so obvious, present and dire af
[1:59:41] <+Promessa_EX> i really really like the sound on this shade
[1:59:44] <Mattais88> Wait what about shades needing to be in shadows?
[1:59:46] <2DSuperiority> infront of the box, not behind
[1:59:47] <Djinnazz> The ycombined
[1:59:47] <RWLJr98> Is this one of them warrior games?
[1:59:47] <tattleworm> they merge together
[1:59:50] <%captain_thickthighs> big dick energy?
[1:59:51] <iosephe> Hey it's that boss from the NieR raid series in Final Fantasy 14, now free up to level 60 with Heavensward and two free classes
[1:59:51] <RiverBirch> Who's Jack?
[1:59:52] <%Dakuu75> I thought it was because they EAT other shades
[1:59:53] <Meta_Outhorii> Oh hey its that boss from ff14
[1:59:53] <Blank9> they address that in the mermaid story
[1:59:53] <%weissguard> Cause they're a bunch of shades combined.
[1:59:54] <+fetrigon> just cuz
[1:59:54] <Mangahero18> I WAS JUST ABOUT TO ASK THAT PAT
[1:59:55] <s__o__u__l_> Because Video Games moon2WOW
[1:59:56] <%RetroCop87> I assume it's a hivemind thing
[1:59:56] <%shurtal> i just hear Lemmy screaming about "THE ACE OF SPADES" when i look at this bad boy
[1:59:56] <%bread_assassin> Fusion?
[1:59:58] <%Breaknoon> isnt it all the small ones from the field together?
[1:59:58] <BeezusHrist> I for one am not going to be having kids with people with hereditary illnesses.....
[1:59:58] <%Hilleltaco> Collection of a bunch probably?
[1:59:58] <mai_cu> stronger personalities maybe?
[1:59:59] <HeroToxiko> big GLOM
[1:59:59] <%Monkeyweed21> amalgamations @PatStaresAt
[1:59:59] <%thedankestmeeme> eesogee
[2:00:00] <Ethel9727> @PatStaresAt In one of the side stories it's' explained that in most cases they are just amalgams of tons of shades, BUT certain shades can be stupid powerful for some reason
[2:00:00] <%ringabal> REINER NO
[2:00:01] <%GalacticaPhanto> Maybe because they absorb other shades given what happens later?
[2:00:01] <VidulaSaix> @Mattais88 Its overcast
[2:00:01] <datlambo458> I know that some are merges of many
[2:00:04] <Mangahero18> Pat read my brain
[2:00:04] <nevan_44> they eat a lot :)
[2:00:05] <%Garthunox> Its that guy what from the ff14 thing
[2:00:05] <blackbookalpha> Eating
[2:00:05] <%Maids4lyfe> Jack is the giant monster @RiverBirch
[2:00:06] <hat_under_bread> Big egos. The biggest and best egos of all time.
[2:00:07] <oda_flobunaga> They are Gestalts, conglomerations of many souls
[2:00:08] <%thetunnelhomer> Knave of hearts, from the hit MMO FF14
[2:00:08] <EndCrawler> lots of shades combined
[2:00:11] <WonderSign> Spite?
[2:00:13] <Tonicky > it Jack
[2:00:13] <%SuperFineButtHairs> ya missed pat
[2:00:17] <mr_saturday93> If woolie was a shade hell look like this and some shades look huge because they eat other shades absorb them
[2:00:20] <+Kduff89> You can as the same thing about the T virus cant you?
[2:00:21] <OkamiDude15> @MisterRockett lyre/harp can double as a blunt object
[2:00:22] <RiverBirch> @Maids4lyfe I KNOW THAT BUT WHO IS JACK
[2:00:26] <%LouieRouie> He's gonna steal your tarts, man!
[2:00:27] <Ethel9727> Also the more shades are part of an amalgam, the less sapient thhey get
[2:00:32] <Nupinoop296> ah yes, just like the Darkside in Kingdom Hearts-
[2:00:40] <%thedankestmeeme> cause its a collection of shades? are u serious pat
[2:00:41] <%SuperFineButtHairs> rip
[2:00:41] <ExpressNode> Wow those camera angles are fucky.
[2:00:42] <%OswaldTheDog> maybe it’s like kingdom hearts and it has something to do with the strength of their hearts
[2:00:43] <%BoxNavy> yes
[2:00:45] <%averyoddjew> nah, that's "we have to talk so i'm going to take less damage"
[2:00:52] <%thelaxinator> this music is burned into me after so many runs of Puppet's bunker
[2:01:03] <%Breaknoon> shoot magic while attacking
[2:01:09] <%bread_assassin> I gotta watch Clemp's Nier series again. There's a lot of lore stuff I;m forgetting.
[2:01:17] <+skyheys> jack and the hill is my favorite moment of the game. what a well designed sequence that the game prepares you for subtly
[2:01:19] <+D00msDayDan> oh god twitch is doing silly things to this music
[2:01:19] <Fro5tburn> wow that looks pretty handy 4Head
[2:01:21] <mr_saturday93> It's actually because they absorb other shades that's why they don't some out
[2:01:23] <DSD24> Hah Disarmed!
[2:01:24] <stormhawk9891> That works too
[2:01:26] <%ejackalope> that's brutal

[2:01:55] <hat_under_bread> The health bar, dummy.
[2:01:57] <JetpackMcQuack> How about no
[2:02:00] <%averyoddjew> if only we could slap him with his own arm
[2:02:01] <%bassoontyphoon> Take that you evil monstar
[2:02:10] <%Dakuu75> group up and hit it till it dies.
[2:02:16] <mr_saturday93> Man if they androids had magic they might've won the ear against the machines
[2:02:24] <tattleworm> dark hand's real good for breaking blocks
[2:02:25] <%Jaxnos> hmmmm
[2:02:28] <%BoxNavy> the shabies
[2:02:34] <HeroToxiko> way to exterminate the, uh huh
[2:02:38] <OkamiDude15> shadow babies

[2:02:50] <%OswaldTheDog> whoops
[2:02:51] <+D00msDayDan> name your shadow baby shade
[2:02:54] <%Breaknoon> nice
[2:02:55] <+Promessa_EX> gluttony is usually the way to go if you need to stop magic attacks
[2:02:57] <RWLJr98> I hate magic
[2:03:10] <Mattais88> I do wish we'd get backstory for all the part 1 bosses in ending 2
[2:03:17] <%Breaknoon> gogogo
[2:03:18] <brachydios777> That's aTitan bubble
[2:03:18] <DSD24> I love that new dodge
[2:03:19] <%TheLemuroid> you can lose if it makes it
[2:03:22] <%captain_thickthighs> so if i remember the plot of this right the shades are the answer to that old purgatory babys podcast bit
[2:03:23] <%BoxNavy> shadeses
[2:03:24] <+karmahoudini_guitar> use magic attacks to break guard, or heavier weaponry
[2:03:29] <%SuperFineButtHairs> ballz
[2:03:33] <HeroToxiko> oh god is that creatures name "the nursery?
[2:03:38] <iosephe> kill da babies
[2:03:48] <blackbookalpha> boba shades
[2:03:51] <%weissguard> Oh no! It's that reoccurring boss fight from Skyward Sword!
[2:03:54] <s__o__u__l_> Thats probably the explanation for why its so big, its a bunch of babies LUL typical Yoko Taro
[2:03:57] <%Breaknoon> BIGU PANCHI
[2:03:59] <Mangahero18> So at least some of the Shades are children souls right? But the replicants age and die just like humans...so in ideal circumstances with the shadowlord succeeding would some of those children just end up in adult bodies and vice versa???
[2:03:59] <+emVulpine> @HeroToxiko No, that's Goose.
[2:04:03] <%RetroCop87> you can FEEL the shockwave
[2:04:04] <OkamiDude15> @HeroToxiko naw its jack of hearts i think
[2:04:05] <%GalacticaPhanto> @herotoxiko no but you're not off with a boss name later on
[2:04:08] <%Breaknoon> it's like a Big-O punch
[2:04:10] <Fro5tburn> gotta hand it to Weiss, he doesn't pull his punches Kappa
[2:04:13] <Blank9> it's cooler than unite hand
[2:04:17] <%averyoddjew> it packs... a "punch"
[2:04:25] <%Breaknoon> SHIT HOG
[2:04:28] <peyodogo> HER
[2:04:28] <Fro5tburn> 4Head hahahahaha

[2:04:38] <%weissguard> psaDogchamp
[2:04:39] <oda_flobunaga> Its probably Dark souls Logic, many souls one body= big body

[2:07:08] <%Breaknoon> DRILLLLLL
[2:07:09] <Mangahero18> Yea you gotta stare at her ass and get told off by Kaine 10 times. Just like the similar achievement in Automata with 2B.

[2:08:21] <Ethel9727> I appreciate that every single time when he fails to kill Jack, NieR tries a different spell for the finisher

[2:08:58] <+BIumen> yes exactly

[2:09:41] <%Dakuu75> Did it go after Emile first because it was afraid of getting petrified?
[2:09:45] <Tonicky > Emil has anime friendship powers in that he meets some one and they are his best friends now
[2:09:46] <%President_Miyazaki> President_Miyazaki subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 38 months! NieR good. Parosmia bad.
[2:09:47] <%Breaknoon> Kaine gonna get fuckin STONED bro
[2:09:47] <%Ranryu692> oh, it looks like the aliens
[2:09:49] <%TheLemuroid> I wonder what this shade's backstory is
[2:09:51] <VidulaSaix> Yeah walls busted
[2:09:55] <HeroToxiko> unironically, i love it. naoki urasawas monster had the best clipshow episode where it was just stuff you didn't see and actual story stuff. sorry for gushing about it
[2:09:56] <%Breaknoon> I named my cats Emil and Kaine
[2:09:58] <%Maids4lyfe> what spell is Pat using?
[2:10:02] <Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Based on Yonah's diary loading screens, it seems like the story takes place over months.
[2:10:06] <+emVulpine> The way I always take it is that it actually takes Nier a lot longer to travel between towns than it actually does.
[2:10:11] <+BIumen> kaine what does that mean
[2:10:16] <%SuperFineButtHairs> YEYEYEYE
[2:10:18] <+gitgouda> ora?
[2:10:19] <%ssjklyco> It will start a Streaming channel in the basement
[2:10:22] <%psidefx> I member this part
[2:10:24] <HeroToxiko> Yeah nier, push the problem under the rug YEYEYEYE
[2:10:26] <Djinnazz> @Daniel_Is_I Yeah, it's like a year

[2:10:33] <Mangahero18> Oh no! But the basement is where Devola and Popola keep all their creepy sex stuff!
[2:10:36] <%Ranryu692> Why? You're clearly kicking its ass
[2:10:36] <+Kduff89> ORA ORA
[2:10:37] <Orenjevel> One two!
[2:10:37] <yourliteraldog> ASS
[2:10:39] <DSD24> Here we go
[2:10:39] <datlambo458> Yeah the sense of time progression in this game gets weird some times
[2:10:39] <reonome> oh shit its this part
[2:10:39] <%BoxNavy> D:
[2:10:40] <+fetrigon> i feel like that has more than one meaning
[2:10:41] <Ethel9727> In one of the short stories we get the rough estimate that it takes less than a day to travel to Seafront, but NieR can't make the journey there and back before dark
[2:10:42] <+RyTYoung> VoteNay
[2:10:42] <%SuperFineButtHairs> :O
[2:10:43] <+Zxtole> We know from the official timeline that the story of Nier takes place over like a year before the time skip
[2:10:44] <%athuramn> oh I forgot this terrible plan

[2:11:00] <%averyoddjew> EDGE LORD INCOMING
[2:11:00] <BeezusHrist> Shit... hits... fan
[2:11:01] <reonome> D:
[2:11:01] <Nupinoop296> UM
[2:11:02] <+evbites> Fuck me pal
[2:11:02] <LordOfThePoultry> YEYEYEYE
[2:11:04] <+Promessa_EX> kaine is really good at holding doors
[2:11:05] <%OswaldTheDog> ouch
[2:11:11] <%SuperFineButtHairs> oh hello nier
[2:11:17] <%Zeikier> uh oh here comes the edgy version of shadowlord
[2:11:17] <%Tenkay> its the mothman
[2:11:17] <%captain_thickthighs> its satan
[2:11:19] <%Breaknoon> Yes
[2:11:19] <%BoxNavy> YEP
[2:11:19] <%bassoontyphoon> Ouch my superior vena cava
[2:11:20] <HeroToxiko> so much more
[2:11:20] <reonome> the fact that he isn't dead is pretty bullshit
[2:11:22] <Orenjevel> shadowlord doesn't look nearly as cool as in gestalt unfortunately
[2:11:22] <%AllenDeadman> yup
[2:11:23] <+skyheys> the shadowlords design is SO BAD in all versions
[2:11:25] <%Agami23> i like that he zips around the room like a moth trapped in a lamp
[2:11:25] <%BoxNavy> and i HATE it
[2:11:26] <%athuramn> yep
[2:11:26] <Kougaon1> why did they have to call him shadowlord
[2:11:26] <Blank9> that is so blatant
[2:11:26] <nevan_44> MAAA THERE'S A WEIRD MOTH
[2:11:29] <Louie_Salmon> It's pretty obvious either way really
[2:11:29] <%Fooguwu> wait, why does shadowlord age though
[2:11:29] <%Zeikier> I finally found you, FAKER!
[2:11:29] <+dante_must_die_exe> nuh uh shut up
[2:11:31] <Ethel9727> Also the Shadowlord looks SO GOOD in this one
[2:11:31] <VidulaSaix> I think its more obvious with Papa because it has his ggoblin face
[2:11:31] <%AllenDeadman> also with better graphics that actually show his face
[2:11:31] <Psyramics> I think that's just the higher fidelity
[2:11:32] <+skyheys> ITS SO BAD
[2:11:32] <%SuperFineButtHairs> thats not even hiding it
[2:11:35] <+Kduff89> Aw I like evil papa neir better
[2:11:36] <%Breaknoon> father SL is hyper uggo
[2:11:38] <+emVulpine> I mean, it was always pretty obvious.
[2:11:40] <+BIumen> @reonome they're built different :)
[2:11:40] <shieldecho> And no one points it out for some reason
[2:11:40] <Mangahero18> wait what
[2:11:43] <blackbookalpha> Gawrsh Sora
[2:11:43] <%Deft_Thought> Man, the Shadowlord is an idiot
[2:11:43] <tattleworm> i like the cracked statue look
[2:11:44] <%NitronStreams> Its kinda obvious in both versions
[2:11:45] <+fugatlas> where these shades coming from tho
[2:11:45] <%sabertoothzombie> it's about the same
[2:11:46] <%Dakuu75> I always think of FFXI Shadow Lord
[2:11:47] <%Zeikier> imagine bein so baller your own blood bows to you
[2:11:47] <%DEETRz> papa nier best nier
[2:11:49] <%OswaldTheDog> It is you’re right
[2:11:50] <Louie_Salmon> The higher quality models help a lot here too
[2:11:51] <Mangahero18> why are more Shades being born from the blood?
[2:11:52] <charrchord> Shades come from blood?
[2:11:54] <%RetroCop87> "What's that noise, guys?"
[2:11:55] <%bassoontyphoon> I know it’s petty but I hate brother nier
[2:11:56] <%ringabal> Look at this DemiFiend
[2:11:57] <$realm_forge> Shadow dad nier was waaaay more intimidating
[2:11:59] <%Reaped_Psyche> Reaped_Psyche subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! Just rewatched the old Nier playthrough.  Definitely a bigger fan of Papa Nier than Oniichan.  Got here just in time to see Kaine block the door with her immovable thiccness.  All praise the booty that saved the people.
[2:12:00] <TioXyco> It's not like it less obvious with papa nier
[2:12:00] <bubbli97> that just looks like Nier holy shit
[2:12:02] <Mangahero18> Arent they human souls? TARO EXPLAIN THIS
[2:12:04] <%athuramn> @blackbookalpha I hate that I read that in goofy's voice LOL
[2:12:05] <%Breaknoon> Let's doom the world though selfish actions! Yeah!
[2:12:08] <DSD24> Its Noir!
[2:12:09] <%SuperFineButtHairs> "why he look like me?"
[2:12:09] <yourliteraldog> Break her over your knee
[2:12:09] <%captain_thickthighs> ever find it weird when you player is way smarter then the protag. like dude how you not know your face
[2:12:13] <Fro5tburn> SourPls
[2:12:17] <Orenjevel> He's the leader of the bunch, you know him well
[2:12:20] <%BoxNavy> yes
[2:12:21] <datlambo458> yes
[2:12:21] <+fugatlas> is it supposed to be that jack of hearts is like an amalgam of shades and he was able to call them from the blood? since a lil jack of heart is there?
[2:12:21] <%RetroCop87> ???
[2:12:23] <blackbookalpha> @athuramn perfect, just as intended
[2:12:24] <%TubeMan642> Can anyone just go Hey Nier he kinda looks like you

[2:12:31] <+BIumen> WESKER
[2:12:32] <HeroToxiko> neat
[2:12:35] <Ethel9727> I think it's intended that more shades are born from the blood because the Shadowlord is using his special stuff to stabilize the ones that went insane instide Jack
[2:12:35] <Nupinoop296> what in the heck is goin on
[2:12:36] <reonome> weiss flailing around is pretty funny

[2:13:24] <+Kduff89> Same @sendart
[2:13:24] <+D00msDayDan> i love how dramatic these shots of two books floating at each other are
[2:13:25] <+evbites> The worst guy for just talk he's such an evil fuck
[2:13:27] <charrchord> Noir got a orangutan face
[2:13:27] <blackbookalpha> ye they redid the lines

[2:13:29] <reonome> NANJI WA WARE
[2:13:31] <%iwa5h4ck3d> This VA is amazing
[2:13:31] <peyodogo> @Louie_Salmon it all is, i think
[2:13:33] <+SilverDevilfish> DC Douglass doing his best Steve Blum impression
[2:13:34] <%Dakuu75> Noir's voice is grand
[2:13:34] <%thedankestmeeme> How can a mere tool expect to beat the SHADOWLORD
[2:13:37] <%bassoontyphoon> God I would bang that book solely for the voice
[2:13:38] <+Spag313> oh nice i just joined for the best scene in video games
[2:13:39] <+gitgouda> yeah weiss let it all show
[2:13:40] <Ethel9727> Imagine how different this would have gone if Noir just used the word "Human" once
[2:13:41] <blackbookalpha> Kaine swears more in this game
[2:13:43] <cydalei> these book faces are so goofy I love it
[2:13:47] <%TubeMan642> If Wiess would've failed here everything would be fine
[2:13:47] <+Macbutters86> fuck. if noir would just tell him whats up, this could all be  solved
[2:13:47] <OkamiDude15> join me, goldman, weiss
[2:13:50] <+evbites> MORON
[2:13:53] <%Breaknoon> SOON
[2:13:53] <tattleworm> why you gotta sound so evil though
[2:14:00] <+Macbutters86> why have villain anime laugh
[2:14:02] <Daniel_Is_I> Noir's too damn dramatic
[2:14:07] <%Breaknoon> They all dumb
[2:14:07] <BeezusHrist> de-constructing the "fairytale"
[2:14:07] <%averyoddjew> if Noir didn't phrase this so dumb, everything would have worked
[2:14:08] <%ringabal> It was foretold my Gyromancy!
[2:14:08] <OkamiDude15> aizen planned it all from the start weiss
[2:14:10] <%OswaldTheDog> and make grey
[2:14:11] <+gitgouda> *shake shake*
[2:14:13] <Orenjevel> Together they will defeat the time cube
[2:14:13] <%Treuan> shadowlord never thought about friendship
[2:14:13] <Mangahero18> From Top to Bottom every part of the humans plans to save humanity was a colossal failure.
[2:14:14] <%greasypete00> :)
[2:14:15] <%BoxNavy> everyone in this game is a stupid idiot to be fair
[2:14:15] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[2:14:17] <DSD24> THIS WORLD IS IMPERFECT
[2:14:17] <+ApocalypticExpress> WESKEEEERRRRRR
[2:14:17] <Louie_Salmon> Man shadowlord is still such a dumb name
[2:14:19] <OkamiDude15> @ringabal LUL
[2:14:19] <+evbites> @tattleworm the guy who became noir was an asshgole who killed weiss
[2:14:23] <%Tenkay> Why does he send so fucking evil like what the fuck just tell him the stuff
[2:14:24] <%superc37> well given who he is
[2:14:26] <%Agami23> if grimoire noir didnt spec so much into drama he would totally win weiss over
[2:14:27] <HeroToxiko> now that i think of it, picking up on the dao theme should have been more clear a decade ago
[2:14:28] <charrchord> A book trying to be intimidating is very silly
[2:14:30] <+Promessa_EX> you're not supposed to get so strong
[2:14:30] <reonome> why'd he had to say it evil then
[2:14:31] <%SuperFineButtHairs> yeah but fuck wesker tho
[2:14:31] <%Tenkay> Noir fucks up so bad in this scene
[2:14:32] <godzookylives> UROBORUS
[2:14:32] <+skyheys> pat be nice the shadow lord is a child
[2:14:32] <tattleworm> i know
[2:14:33] <mr_saturday93> why the fuck is he evil about it though
[2:14:33] <%ssjklyco> Grimoir Noirs design has a bonnet
[2:14:36] <%TheWinged7> become as gods
[2:14:36] <%maybefalco> YEYEYEYE HERE WE GO
[2:14:37] <stormhawk9891> HERE WE GO
[2:14:37] <+BIumen> shadowlord makes sense as a name when you consider a kid made it up
[2:14:37] <%weissguard> yeyeye
[2:14:37] <peyodogo> shh pat
[2:14:38] <reonome> HERE IT COMES
[2:14:38] <%averyoddjew> yes
[2:14:38] <+RealPT1> dad shadow Lord is much more imposing
[2:14:38] <TioXyco> I mean, he couldn't predict you punching Weiss so hard he would forget everything
[2:14:39] <+Zxtole> Noir was a super asshole before he was turned into a book, so it fits his character
[2:14:39] <%ejackalope> kinda funny watching just two books floating around each other
[2:14:40] <%ringabal> SNAP BACK TO REALITY
[2:14:40] <%iShouldBeAtWorklol> I'm watching books talk to each other
[2:14:40] <AmuserName> :)
[2:14:41] <VidulaSaix> SHE SAID THE THINGS
[2:14:42] <charrchord> PogChamp
[2:14:42] <%Fooguwu> noir is just an asshole
[2:14:44] <%SuperFineButtHairs> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:14:44] <%Zeikier> yeah, iirc the backstory shows that the person who becomes Noir is just a needlessly dramatic asshole so that winds up making problems later
[2:14:44] <LunarRemix> The story wouldn't happen if he just explained
[2:14:44] <%weissguard> BEST RANT

[2:15:52] <cubelock555> the new shadowlord's castle is so good
[2:15:53] <%bassoontyphoon> Also this is by far my favourite track in the whole game
[2:15:54] <%Zeikier> I like how much of this story is built on the main players involved not being fit for their roles and circumstances just making things fall to shit out of control
[2:15:55] <%ringabal> The world was doomed cuz a book was called bitch

[2:17:21] <Ciglossonjr> @peyodogo I know, but i've listened to the new shadowlord's castle and I don't remember it going this hard. Maybe I just forgot

[2:18:20] <%Zeikier> @BeezusHrist yeah the merging system is great and super deep animation variety
[2:18:21] <+emVulpine> I think the blame is pretty thinly spread in this story, actually.

[2:18:59] <AllRabbitProductio> Dunno if shadowlord can talk, can he?
[2:18:59] <%Agami23> noir being a drama queen absolutely ruined it

[2:19:26] <+skyheys> its the game making you feel heroic while you do a bad thing
[2:19:27] <%averyoddjew> to calm the kids maybe?
[2:19:27] <%thbluewarden> they are very helpful
[2:19:28] <Tonicky > with all the villagers lol
[2:19:28] <Mangahero18> The shadows only talk in english, an incomprehensible dead language. Everyone else is speaking some unholy fusion of Spanish and Japanese...probably.
[2:19:29] <+emVulpine> Pat, not everything has to be diagetic.
[2:19:32] <Orenjevel> inspire courage +1 atk / dmg

[2:19:51] <EternalJedi> Mangahero18 I think the name for it is Chaos French
[2:19:54] <+Macbutters86> I mean, technically it's devola and popular fault!
[2:19:55] <Ethel9727> Yeah, they are probably singing it to calm the villagers before their bodies get taken. After all, it's not like the Shadowlord could fuck this up right?
[2:19:55] <%athuramn> but words tho
[2:19:56] <datlambo458> plus bad apples
[2:20:00] <HeroToxiko> it's hilarious how he's fighting him only to literally do what noir said to do but with violence instead LUL
[2:20:00] <%athuramn> who needs them
[2:20:02] <%Zeikier> yeah honestly, pop and dev are prolly more at fault than bro and SL lol
[2:20:03] <DSD24> I love this part
[2:20:03] <reonome> @datlambo458 kaine can hear it tho
[2:20:04] <+Macbutters86> @mr_saturday93 exactly

[2:20:17] <Orenjevel> This is also Theme of Village, so it fits
[2:20:18] <2DSuperiority> even then it would be "hey how about erasing yourself for the real people to take over yeah?"
[2:20:21] <%Breaknoon> it's Angelu's fault
[2:20:23] <+Mrbaconator> why this game gotta be depressing tho
[2:20:25] <DSD24> Get my powers back!
[2:20:25] <Caliptus85> SING LOUDER PAT YOU KNOW YOU CANT RESIST

[2:20:48] <%TubeMan642> @PatStaresAt even if they did just talk Kaine would convince them not to listen , seeing as she can already understand shades
[2:20:54] <Fro5tburn> monkaS

[2:21:15] <%Monkeyweed21> POLYGON ATTACK
[2:21:15] <+fetrigon> MERELY A FLESH WOUND
[2:21:16] <LunarRemix> That looked bad
[2:21:17] <peyodogo> ruhroh
[2:21:19] <%za7az> #NRT
[2:21:19] <RiverBirch> P-put some ointment on that
[2:21:20] <Orenjevel> Nier sure does get impaled a lot.
[2:21:21] <DSD24> Nier is getting his ass kicked
[2:21:21] <Djinnazz> aaaand puberty
[2:21:23] <%averyoddjew> "NO WE NEED THAT" - shadowlord, probably
[2:21:24] <%NocturneNovember> Oh fuck, the Shadowlord!
[2:21:25] <%athuramn> actually, he really won't
[2:21:25] <+D00msDayDan> you will understand since we won't tell you
[2:21:25] <%SuperFineButtHairs> peace out
[2:21:26] <%Breaknoon> DBZ wounds
[2:21:27] <mr_saturday93> if I was the shadoelord I'll just kill nier, Kiana, and Emil right there and take wiess
[2:21:27] <peyodogo> THEY COULD UNDERSTAND NOW IF YOU USED YOUR WORDS
[2:21:28] <Explodincatz> hes fiiiine
[2:21:28] <+buffn99> Book Wesker has such a cool voice
[2:21:29] <%MelBrooksKA> Nier is getting stabbed a lot lately
[2:21:29] <+skyheys> TELL THEM NOE
[2:21:30] <Orenjevel> he needs some milk
[2:21:31] <+Macbutters86> @ethel9727 anime protagoni
[2:21:31] <+evbites> Now why doesn't shadowlord take nier now
[2:21:32] <karovus> but by then itll be too late noir!
[2:21:33] <Mangahero18> Why would a scientist explain shit to their test animals right? I mean its not like it would change anything anyway...what are they gonna say? "Please dont resist as the corrupted and decrepit souls of humanity take over your bodies and erase your souls, this is for the best."
[2:21:34] <OkamiDude15> @Ethel9727 just gotta shove some herbs and stuff in there he can walk it off
[2:21:34] <%OswaldTheDog> man this game loves to stab people
[2:21:34] <$realm_forge> It’s not gay if it’s also you
[2:21:34] <reonome> lmao emil's no
[2:21:35] <tattleworm> it looks like when a ragdoll glitches out and stretches everywhere and that's awesome
[2:21:36] <+FroggoPrince> Grimoire Douglas doesn't give a fuck
[2:21:36] <%ringabal> Quickly, get some mold juice!
[2:21:38] <Tracazoid> Just a flesh wound
[2:21:40] <+SilverDevilfish> "My sister now"
[2:21:40] <%Alazull> Okay the Shadowlord is at big fault right here
[2:21:41] <+DazzlingFuhrer> miss u papa nier
[2:21:41] <%Agami23> you know, i wonder what could have gone differently if shadowlord could speak. but i guess thats part of the games theme
[2:21:42] <%Deft_Thought> Like, REALLY? You need that shit, dummy
[2:21:42] <%BoxNavy> no
[2:21:45] <%LouieRouie> She's my sister now
[2:21:45] <%psidefx> Give my arm back
[2:21:46] <%Zeikier> Dougbook
[2:21:48] <AtrusHB> @mr_saturday93 not sure "Hey your entire sentience is an aberration and we're gonna have to kill you SORRY ;) " would go down well
[2:21:48] <+emVulpine> Grimoire Noir has whatever the vocal equivalent is of "resting bitch face."
[2:21:49] <Tonicky > or you could explain it now
[2:21:50] <primaryfire> fucking watch it noire, you almost killed my vessel
[2:21:51] <+fetrigon> nah
[2:21:56] <%TheWinged7> man, this scene is much more impactful with papa Neir
[2:21:57] <+skyheys> "lmaoooo dab on em" Noir
[2:21:57] <DSD24> Such a villain line
[2:22:00] <%averyoddjew> GIVE KAINE THE KEY DAMMIT
[2:22:02] <reonome> JUST TALK JESUS
[2:22:03] <DSD24> So much blood
[2:22:04] <+tetraes> i really like the shadowlords wings

[2:22:22] <%Dakuu75> fucking NO
[2:22:23] <%TheWinged7> LUL
[2:22:24] <%SuperFineButtHairs> no
[2:22:24] <+D00msDayDan> @pettydoggerel don't worry about it, just remember it's all 9/11
[2:22:26] <%TheWinged7> are you ok
[2:22:26] <%Breaknoon> sad time
[2:22:27] <%Zeikier> bluddo
[2:22:28] <OkamiDude15> @reonome even if they could it wouldnt work out
[2:22:30] <reonome> does he look ok emil
[2:22:31] <%AzureGale> No, that's ketchup
[2:22:31] <hat_under_bread> What do you think Weiss.
[2:22:33] <Caliptus85> best protagonist is Papa Nier. I know that its not your original vision Yoko Taro but its just the truth
[2:22:35] <Fro5tburn> D:
[2:22:35] <+fetrigon> oh right blind fold
[2:22:37] <%solracc25> that butterfly stole my sister!
[2:22:40] <+fugatlas> well aint that convenient
[2:22:41] <hat_under_bread> err, Emil
[2:22:43] <%SuperFineButtHairs> what happened to Kaine?
[2:22:45] <%Deft_Thought> Also; It's implied Shadows can understand the Heroes. Shadowlord literally fucked it all up.
[2:22:46] <+zzNamttamzz> Except Weiss, the thing we actually need
[2:22:46] <mycoldshoulder> man this scene is much better when it appeals to my cultural preference
[2:22:47] <%superc37> i find it weird how pre timeskip shadowlord is babby nier and post timeskip is teen nier. wouldnt he always be teen nier?
[2:22:50] <%SuperFineButtHairs> she poopin?
[2:22:50] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Now the true question is, will you choose the best ending?
[2:22:50] <%OswaldTheDog> NO HE’S NOT EMIL
[2:22:54] <%Breaknoon> "i wanna see your eyes"
[2:22:56] <+RyTYoung> gigaboOtsBani2 gigaboOtsBani2 gigaboOtsBani2
[2:22:57] <%spitelite> i wonder what they talked about at the mansion
[2:23:01] <+fugatlas> @SuperFineButtHairs Shade i nher heart is taking over
[2:23:02] <reonome> BibleThump
[2:23:06] <%athuramn> OR A CHAIR
[2:23:07] <%Tenkay> The true question here is why doesnt he just petrify the fucking door
[2:23:07] <%ringabal> "Dick him real good. For me."
[2:23:07] <Nupinoop296> oh no.......
[2:23:07] <%averyoddjew> GIVE HER THE FUCKING KEY
[2:23:12] <%athuramn> OR PETRIFY THE DOOR
[2:23:13] <JetpackMcQuack> Turn me into a mastercraft
[2:23:15] <+Mrbaconator> oh so THAT'S emil
[2:23:16] <+D00msDayDan> tyronn is like NO DON'T DO IT
[2:23:16] <%MelBrooksKA> "I really wanna get stoned"
[2:23:16] <Caliptus85> @mycoldshoulder yup thats how culture works
[2:23:17] <datlambo458> i think older brother is best after everthing is said and done
[2:23:17] <Djinnazz> @Deft_Thought Yeah, he doesn't care about anything except Yohan at this point
[2:23:20] <HeroToxiko> oh he isn't actually blind, he's petrification scott summers
[2:23:27] <%cvp5127> emil cant see the key LUL
[2:23:29] <DSD24> @Tenkay Kaine is holding the door closed
[2:23:30] <tengel66> Petrify me, bitch
[2:23:31] <primaryfire> @superfinebutthairs think she's just straining herself from keeping the door closed
[2:23:31] <+fugatlas> the issue isn't locking the door, it's that the shade is breaking loose
[2:23:33] <reonome> i still don't understand how kaine's petrified body held back the door
[2:23:33] <%Breaknoon> She just wants to die
[2:23:33] <Kougaon1> Turn her into Door Chan
[2:23:34] <+emVulpine> I don't think he can petrify doors.
[2:23:34] <inutaihanyou123> pain
[2:23:36] <%pettydoggerel> @D00msDayDan Um... ok I'm american I can do that
[2:23:38] <%Ranryu692> Doesn't Nier have a key in his pocket?
[2:23:40] <HeroToxiko> also SourPls banger alert SourPls
[2:23:42] <willsin4fun> hodor
[2:23:42] <Louie_Salmon> Oh does she also have a shade situation going on?

[2:23:56] <DSD24> Shadowlord took the Key

[2:23:56] <%AllenDeadman> now she's a pretty rock
[2:23:57] <%SuperFineButtHairs> rip
[2:23:59] <%AzureGale> F
[2:23:59] <%Monkeyweed21> the key is useless at this point
[2:24:01] <TuxedoNash> all you had to do was give her the damn key, CJ
[2:24:02] <$realm_forge> STOP BEING A BITCH EMIL
[2:24:03] <Nupinoop296> oh nooooo
[2:24:03] <reonome> PAT YOU KILLED HUMANITY

[2:24:09] <Caliptus85> @oswaldthedog why?
[2:24:13] <+Spag313> nah dont do it
[2:24:14] <DSD24> This scene is sad to watch
[2:24:16] <+gitgouda> if only he could petrify the door
[2:24:16] <mr_saturday93> if they'd do nothing the world would be saved
[2:24:16] <%SuperFineButtHairs> kay

[2:24:25] <%athuramn> no more crying, child I met an hour ago
[2:24:25] <%Alazull> This petrification process makes no sense
[2:24:26] <+DazzlingFuhrer> don't worry emil, life will definitely get better.
[2:24:26] <+emVulpine> I took the similar choice B option when I first played Shin Megami Tensei IV and I was like, "This feels kinda pleasant..."
[2:24:28] <datlambo458> Kaine was about to be taken over by the shade
[2:24:28] <yourliteraldog> Never choose peace
[2:24:29] <+RyTYoung> I WILL
[2:24:32] <%superc37> werent his eyes brown in the original?
[2:24:33] <+Qexec> Heal you wounds Nier, grow strong.

[2:24:50] <%solracc25> sad end
[2:24:52] <%averyoddjew> so why does she float up and merge with the door instead of turning to stone on the spot?
[2:24:54] <%ssjklyco> Even if they had they key, if Kaine could'nt hold it, what luck would the lock have done?
[2:24:56] <Blank9> she's been transformed into cool concept art
[2:24:57] <%greasypete00> now perish nier
[2:24:57] <KungFooMaen> looks familiar......
[2:24:58] <+skyheys> this prerendered scene was HIDEOUS in the original game
[2:24:58] <+fetrigon> purdy
[2:24:59] <Djinnazz> Emil close your eyes!
[2:25:03] <reonome> rip girls
[2:25:04] <Daniel_Is_I> How did Nier not die here?
[2:25:04] <%SuperFineButtHairs> tiiiime skip time
[2:25:05] <%TheWinged7> Emil is looking at Neir and hes not petrifying
[2:25:06] <%Breaknoon> this is the end of the empire strikes back moment
[2:25:06] <%athuramn> man, they could've juust thrown a boar at the door and had emil look at that instead
[2:25:07] <%athuramn> but noooo
[2:25:08] <%Monkeyweed21> thats a lot of rock
[2:25:10] <inutaihanyou123> pain
[2:25:10] <%averyoddjew> never explained as to why it worked like that
[2:25:10] <+evbites> @captain_thickthighs don't touch the knob
[2:25:11] <Kadraxan> THE HATE IS BORN

[2:25:23] <twohitgood> so if it was thousands upon thousands of years...why is the nier replicant only just *now* aging??

[2:28:07] <blackbookalpha> ye ye ye
[2:28:08] <%RetroCop87> WTF I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD DO THAT
[2:28:10] <EternalJedi> @PatStaresAt that lets you tap to swap, hold to bring up the menu
[2:28:12] <nevan_44> AW YEAH
[2:28:12] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt If you hold the directional button it will automatically switch to what you last had equipped
[2:28:13] <arkv01> thats HOT
[2:28:14] <Blank9> that's so much better
[2:28:16] <Orenjevel> MUCH better
[2:28:16] <%Ranryu692> oh
[2:28:18] <+fetrigon> @herotoxiko chaps are always assless 🙃
[2:28:18] <%NitronStreams> BECOME PLATINUM
[2:28:20] <%Breaknoon> i didnt know either
[2:28:21] <Ethel9727> I DID NOT KNOW YOU COULD DO THAT
[2:28:21] <TonberryLives> I NEVER SAW THAT
[2:28:23] <%averyoddjew> HOLY SHIT I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS A THING AND I GOT TO ENDING E
[2:28:25] <%Zeikier> also O is a finisher on downed Shades
[2:28:27] <tattleworm> 2h feels SO much better
[2:28:28] <brachydios777> oh
[2:28:32] <+emVulpine> Knock them over and execute them, it's 100% effective.
[2:28:36] <%BoxNavy> i mean youre probably only gonna be using the phoenix spear anyways but hey thats good
[2:28:39] <Blank9> I thought 2 handed swords were stuck permanently for jumping light attacks
[2:28:41] <mr_saturday93> ITD SO GOOD
[2:28:46] <+D00msDayDan> do finishers to armored shades when you knock them down, it kills them way faster
[2:28:47] <+skyheys> game play GOOD now
[2:28:48] <%superc37> THIS IS WHY YOU ALWAYS TRIPLE CHECK YOUR OPTIONS
[2:28:48] <HeroToxiko> @fetrigon i mean wearing nothing neath em
[2:28:49] <BeezusHrist> @patstaresat the shadow lord does not age, but Neir does. They should have made the shadow lord model from 5 years ago an adult
[2:29:01] <Blank9> spear's still all about that jumping heavy though, it just does too much damage and breaks armor
[2:29:01] <BrOOnoh> ye execute them when they fall
[2:29:05] <Mangahero18> phoenix spear is literally the only weapon you need
[2:29:10] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Right now I'm using the Iron Pipe all maxed out for giggles
[2:29:12] <OkamiDude15> O finisher on hard knockdowned enemies is the way to go
[2:29:14] <HeroToxiko> @fetrigon i need to chill out
[2:29:18] <+evbites> circle to ground kill
[2:29:20] <+CodeRegios> O to execute when they are knocked down
[2:29:26] <+buffn99> @PatStaresAt You can do a finisher on downed enemies
[2:29:31] <Ethel9727> It would've also helped disguise the Shadowlord if he came in looking like older Nier immediately
[2:29:32] <blackjack8182> Dark Hand + Finisher = OP
[2:29:32] <Orenjevel> word obtained: hobo
[2:29:35] <%cvp5127> o
[2:29:39] <%Alazull> Oh ddamn
[2:29:41] <+fetrigon> @herotoxiko LUL you alright
[2:29:47] <+evbites> so brual
[2:29:48] <+Promessa_EX> you also have this floating book that shoots magic
[2:29:50] <oda_flobunaga> Try clicking Dark Phantasm to break guards
[2:29:51] <%Alazull> That was really violent
[2:29:52] <%averyoddjew> can be done anytime they are knocked down
[2:29:53] <peyodogo> @HeroToxiko nah they're coward for not making him go full assless chaps
[2:29:55] <+emVulpine> It kills pretty much everything save one particular Shade instantly.
[2:29:59] <%BoxNavy> you can stunlock enemies with dark execution and the finisher
[2:30:08] <%SuperFineButtHairs> hes scared :C
[2:30:09] <%Breaknoon> Bro Nier LOVE killing shades
[2:30:09] <OkamiDude15> light counter on spear does big fucking damage
[2:30:10] <%charp35> you can cancel the finisher animation with a roll
[2:30:10] <Blank9> jump heavy with spear also breaks armor/guards
[2:30:10] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[2:30:12] <HeroToxiko> @HeroToxiko yes
[2:30:14] <peyodogo> the injustice
[2:30:16] <+skye_mm> LUL
[2:30:17] <%ringabal> The shade is spamming parries!

[2:30:26] <EndCrawler> he dancing
[2:30:28] <blackbookalpha> he was vibing to the bgm
[2:30:32] <mannywatcha> @PatStaresAt So will this Nier have a different ending from the orignal.
[2:30:35] <Orenjevel> did the guard break just not come make it through to the remake?

[2:35:34] <HeroToxiko> dROP YOUR ROUTINE
[2:35:34] <%Alazull> Gallons of Maybelline
[2:35:35] <Ethel9727> Do you think Popola and Devola go through the awkward period every generation where they are like "Oh god, he's hot again."
[2:35:35] <Blank9> it's the power of lizard tails
[2:35:35] <%valriot> Kappa

[2:35:38] <+fetrigon> :)
[2:35:39] <+D00msDayDan> gee popola it's like you're some kind of ageless machine

[2:35:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> I NieR a quarry whore now?
[2:35:40] <+RyTYoung> Maybe it's Maybelline?
[2:35:40] <%Zeikier> it's-a mil, mario!
[2:35:40] <$realm_forge> The clapping of Nier’s ass woke Kaine from her petrified slumber
[2:35:41] <brachydios777> Hmmmmmmmmmmmm
[2:35:42] <Daniel_Is_I> It's-a me, Emil!

[2:35:44] <televisedrevolting> Maybe it's natural, maybe it's [DATA EXPUNGED]
[2:35:52] <reonome> how did literally no one notice popola and devola never changing
[2:35:53] <%YakumoYomi> Biomutant comes out on the 25th, I think
[2:35:54] <+BIumen> "anyway here's more emil implied story you didnt see"
[2:35:54] <blackbookalpha> Popola rubs Shaman Fish on her face
[2:35:55] <Sunstalker> its the mcdonalds
[2:35:55] <%pettydoggerel> It's Maybelline
[2:35:56] <%Breaknoon> Kainer's petro
[2:35:57] <+averyoddjew> time for DIABLO
[2:35:59] <%valriot> "Nier, i found a plot device"
[2:36:02] <%OswaldTheDog> great skin care routine
[2:36:05] <%RetroCop87> Who likes Diablo!?
[2:36:06] <%Sweetangy021> The comment about her not changing stands out so much more with brother NieR compared to the father
[2:36:23] <%pettydoggerel> She drinks A LOT of water
[2:36:23] <KungFooMaen> they're trying FeelsBadMan
[2:36:27] <tattleworm> they tried
[2:36:27] <%Alazull> Super, super bad
[2:36:28] <TonberryLives> They are super terrible
[2:36:29] <blackbookalpha> Feed them fish :)
[2:36:33] <%Breaknoon> do mad air dashes
[2:36:35] <%pettydoggerel> Remember to hydrate guys
[2:36:36] <+emVulpine> As much as people like Papa Nier, Brother Nier makes a whole lot more sense.
[2:36:38] <Ethel9727> What if they had just waited for him to go to sleep then hogtied him and put Weiss in a book bag.
[2:36:38] <LordOfThePoultry> fuck these two in particular
[2:36:39] <peyodogo> remember: moisturize
[2:36:41] <%Reaped_Psyche> It's the guilt of failing the entirety of humanity that keeps them so youthful.
[2:36:43] <%ejackalope> i know nothing!!
[2:36:44] <EndCrawler> if you have a job for that long you'd start to get burnt out
[2:36:48] <datlambo458> You missed accord you bumb
[2:36:55] <HeroToxiko> i never finished it but i caught up to the lore
[2:36:55] <%averyoddjew> to be fair, the shadowlord is an asshole and made it even harder for them
[2:37:01] <VidulaSaix> Yep
[2:37:01] <$realm_forge> Nier can now perform mid air twerk combos
[2:37:02] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[2:37:02] <reonome> shouldve killed them all
[2:37:06] <datlambo458> yes
[2:37:06] <reonome> yes
[2:37:08] <rReizs> "i acquired an eyepatch" vs "my height multiplied by 1.5"
[2:37:10] <+RyTYoung> yah
[2:37:10] <DSD24> Yes
[2:37:10] <%weissguard> yep
[2:37:12] <VidulaSaix> Yeah shit visited and Yonah wrote about it
[2:37:13] <%possumwalsh1221> Yeeeup
[2:37:15] <%Alazull> The second that Nier met Weiss was pretty much it
[2:37:15] <blackbookalpha> it'll show up again
[2:37:15] <VidulaSaix> she*
[2:37:15] <brachydios777> yeah
[2:37:15] <%bread_assassin> Yeah
[2:37:16] <mycoldshoulder> everyone sucks and is at fault
[2:37:16] <mr_saturday93> he missed about Accord? blind at Pat
[2:37:17] <Blank9> they should've just put nier and yonah ANYWHERE BUT HERE
[2:37:18] <%RetroCop87> you'll get it again, it's super common
[2:37:18] <EndCrawler> yup
[2:37:19] <+emVulpine> It'll come up again.
[2:37:21] <papertoonz1414> she just showed up in the village
[2:37:22] <datlambo458> She sold stuff in the village
[2:37:22] <+emVulpine> It's not particularly rare.
[2:37:22] <+D00msDayDan> yonah has a diary entry about meeting accord
[2:37:24] <LordOfThePoultry> it was over when nier whacked the memories outta weiss
[2:37:24] <+RyTYoung> you'll get it again
[2:37:25] <tattleworm> there's two, one in yonah's diary and one in the black pages
[2:37:28] <%averyoddjew> it was over the instant the original Nier became the shadowlord
[2:37:31] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt "A merchant came to town with a big bag! yadda yadda"
[2:37:31] <blackbookalpha> Accord just bringing her suitcase
[2:37:37] <Tracazoid> Yeah Accord is mentioned in loading screens, she's a traveling merchant
[2:37:46] <%Breaknoon> ESPECIALLY the small SHADES
[2:37:48] <Ethel9727> @averyoddjew I am imagining they are just constantly on the phone with him going "YES I know you want your body. Please just wait a few more centuries."
[2:37:50] <%thbluewarden> they're not you, Kill them!
[2:37:50] <datlambo458> The black page one is really rare and i hate it
[2:37:52] <mycoldshoulder> Project gestalt failed the moment it began
[2:37:53] <brachydios777> Accord does good work
[2:37:56] <Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt "December 22: A merchant passed through the village today, and she just kept pulling the craziest stuff out of her big bag! She said her name was Accord."
[2:37:56] <%greasypete00> horrible unthinking creatures
[2:37:56] <%spitelite> pure evil
[2:37:57] <Nupinoop296> is there a sound of someone saying something when the shades die???
[2:38:01] <jbrachob> you horrible tiny child like creautures!
[2:38:01] <%BoxNavy> i dont even consider nier and the gang are bad at all cus a) they didnt know and b) you cant really ask all of the replicants to give up their lives
[2:38:03] <%YakumoYomi> Die, monsters! You don't belong in this world!
[2:38:05] <%Alazull> She's mentioned once in a note, once in a loading screen IIRC
[2:38:05] <yourliteraldog> Start aging after 1,000 years
[2:38:05] <%Dakuu75> I'm playing RE Village while watching this. -and this music makes this WEIRD lol
[2:38:06] <%RetroCop87> Adult Nier is genuinely uncomfortably aggressive against shades
[2:38:17] <%Breaknoon> Yeah
[2:38:22] <DSD24> @RetroCop87 Well that makes sense
[2:38:25] <%MisterRockett> That would be super new too since Accord didn't show up til DG3- yeah.
[2:38:26] <%Breaknoon> he's def gotten a little more disturbed
[2:38:39] <DSD24> Shadowlord took his only reason for living pretty much
[2:38:40] <%Alazull> Adult Nier is uncomfortably aggresssive to a lot of things
[2:38:44] <%JohnAtDawn> @PatStaresAt Since it's obvious what you're setting up, go ahead and explain why I should feel bad for Shades, versus say, zombies.
[2:38:48] <EndCrawler> i think all the teasing about accord will lead to something in the next game
[2:38:49] <mycoldshoulder> Adult nier is a fucking psycho when it comes to shades

[2:38:54] <Mangahero18> For those who arent aware, Accord is a time/dimension travelling Android that originally showed up on Drakengard 3.
[2:38:58] <mortificent> WutFace WutFace WutFace
[2:39:00] <%Alazull> Remember that when Adult Nier meets Kaine, he says he'll cut her down if he has to\
[2:39:00] <+fetrigon> LUL
[2:39:02] <Saltmeisterr> what?

[2:39:12] <%valriot> GAL GADOT LOVES BROTHER NIER
[2:39:12] <%TheWinged7> Neir HATES the black creatures... ill see myself out
[2:39:13] <+emVulpine> The thing I like about Adult Nier is that he's at heart still much the same person, but he's also this super hateful, kind of scary dude at times.
[2:39:14] <yourliteraldog> No I'm just going through a Great Struggle
[2:39:14] <%MisterRockett> @JohnAtDawn OH YOU DON'T KNOW
[2:39:15] <%captain_thickthighs> i mean e has every cause to dislike them
[2:39:15] <TonberryLives> LUL LUL LUL
[2:39:16] <Blank9> accord sucks
[2:39:18] <+Dorf1> does this remake actually have any new story stuff?
[2:39:19] <trickster721> Yeah, it's radical how good he is at killing these evil shades
[2:39:20] <balthazar758> radical
[2:39:24] <blackbookalpha> I'd love for Square Enix to just remake Drakengard 3 and call it Drakengard Zero
[2:39:25] <%TheLemuroid> Kind of like a certain guy and Titans
[2:39:28] <peyodogo> @valriot oh my god
[2:39:28] <mr_saturday93> Accord is also I. the drakengard manga and it raises even more interesting questions about her
[2:39:30] <%Alazull> @Dorf1 Yes
[2:39:30] <+buffn99> @Dorf1 yeah
[2:39:31] <Daniel_Is_I> Yes remake has new story stuff
[2:39:31] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:39:33] <yourliteraldog> My Great Struggle against the shade
[2:39:33] <rReizs> hey man how about you use this camera to execute these bound shades nierman
[2:39:36] <%RetroCop87> I love how Gideon is super crazy about killing robots, but Nier is only a LITTLE more crazy about shades
[2:39:36] <+TacticalTwerk1ng> is it just me or are their murmurs louder when he's an adult?
[2:39:37] <Strigiform> are the shades bourgeois
[2:39:37] <HeroToxiko> OOOOOP
[2:39:41] <%Breaknoon> nope
[2:39:45] <Nupinoop296> oh noooo
[2:39:50] <+BIumen> technically we're the zombies
[2:39:50] <Djinnazz> Not according to Degeneration
[2:39:52] <Sol_Install> but... warm blood Kappa
[2:39:52] <%Agami23> depending on the setting.
[2:39:52] <%SuperFineButtHairs> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis

[2:39:57] <+Mrbaconator> ye but the shades are bourgeois
[2:39:59] <%Breaknoon> Oopsie the world lolol
[2:40:00] <yourliteraldog> it's far worse than that to
[2:40:00] <Psyramics> isn't it too late by the time they're shades anyway?
[2:40:01] <mycoldshoulder> But shades are also very hostile, most of the time
[2:40:02] <reonome> tbf neither can shades at this point
[2:40:04] <%YakumoYomi> @Strigiform Oh shit...!
[2:40:05] <mannywatcha> Time to see our sad smiley boy
[2:40:07] <EndCrawler> yeah we're the zombies pretty much
[2:40:07] <%Reaped_Psyche> Zombies don't still have human conciousness and goals.
[2:40:08] <%President_Miyazaki> If zombies could go back by killing someone would you feel bad for them?
[2:40:08] <%captain_thickthighs> we cant go back to being people once killed pat
[2:40:08] <%SuperFineButtHairs> hmmmmmmmmmm
[2:40:09] <%LouieRouie> Shades are people. Not used to be. ARE
[2:40:09] <Ethel9727> @emVulpine Yeah, that's what I love so much. He will go, without a mood change, from helping an old lady with her groceries to choking the life out of shades with his bare hands
[2:40:11] <%NateyBeak> so is this whole game just the episode with tuvix and your janeway slamming the undo button
[2:40:12] <%baronouroboros> I killed them all. Not just the adults, but also the younglings.

[2:40:24] <DSD24> Emil is literally built different
[2:40:24] <+BIumen> @Mrbaconator going by lore a large number of shades probably are bourgeois
[2:40:24] <ZeeJiggle> Nier's just like "Why doesn't anyone age??"
[2:40:26] <Daniel_Is_I> Don't question why the magical eye kid doesn't age.
[2:40:28] <yourliteraldog> Imagine killing someones soul
[2:40:29] <mannywatcha> I love you emeal  but god you make me cry seeing your ass.
[2:40:29] <%averyoddjew> god nier is extremely dumb
[2:40:30] <a_mad_dragon_> forever boy
[2:40:31] <%Breaknoon> Emil liek Nier
[2:40:31] <+SilverDevilfish> I'm a BOW living in the Spencer Mansion - Emil
[2:40:32] <blackbookalpha> lol RE af
[2:40:33] <NeonBleu> "Am I the only one aging???"
[2:40:36] <JetpackMcQuack> Zombies aren't defending themselves monkaS
[2:40:39] <$realm_forge> Fun fact: all shades were shitty middle managers in a past life so fuck em
[2:40:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> he's a g-g-g-g-g-ghost?!
[2:40:41] <BrOOnoh> i saw a movie clled resident evil vendetta where the zombies came back to normal
[2:40:43] <jbrachob> time for the umbrella lab

[2:40:51] <$Futurecity10> I’m just built different
[2:40:55] <tattleworm> ohhhh, snow white and there's 7 kids, i just got that
[2:40:57] <%TheLemuroid> I'm convinced from my playthrough that Weiss is the most evil member of the cast
[2:40:58] <Shinsasu> "fired"
[2:40:59] <Ethel9727> Oh god, I never realized that the RE mansion segment was where the BOWs lived
[2:41:19] <%Breaknoon> Angelus and Kaim 4eva
[2:41:22] <mannywatcha> I woudln't mind being an imoortal babe
[2:41:23] <%AzureGale> GOT TROPHY
[2:41:24] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Pat, have you ever just wanted to move to the middle of nowhere, start a soybean farm and get away from it all?
[2:41:25] <+emVulpine> @TheLemuroid It's all beyond good and evil.
[2:41:33] <%athuramn> @Ethel9727 I'm trying not to let my brain say BOW is Breath of the Wild
[2:41:34] <%bread_assassin> You think "fired" from these sort of underground top-secret labs just means "Death"?
[2:41:40] <OkamiDude15> @Psyramics some of them are still fine even as shades
[2:41:43] <datlambo458> Nothing bad will happen
[2:41:44] <%possumwalsh1221> LITERALLY the spencer mansion

[2:41:56] <yourliteraldog> Weed Farm
[2:41:57] <+fugatlas> soybean farming is fucking hard
[2:42:02] <%MisterRockett> Man I feel like Brother Nier's depression is WAY more apparent or maybe I'm just forgetting how sad Papa Nier got after the timeskip.
[2:42:04] <%RetroCop87> can confirm, living in the middle of nowhere gets old SUPER FAST
[2:42:06] <+Freakin_Wolfy> But soybeans are so profitable!
[2:42:08] <TonberryLives> FUCK THE WORLD
[2:42:10] <xbb1024> just buy yourself a Spencer mansion
[2:42:12] <NeonBleu> yes. But the internet will be bad

[2:45:01] <%RetroCop87> Vile Ax is super fun to use
[2:45:03] <+emVulpine> And Kaine survives because she's Kaine.
[2:45:04] <%LouieRouie> Can't leave without my buddy superfly
[2:45:08] <Daniel_Is_I> Don't miss the weapon in here Pat. The camera can hide it behind a wall if you're not careful.
[2:45:09] <%Shadowevilkoala> the dlc one handed and two handed are the best for that weapon type
[2:45:12] <tattleworm> you'll try the angelus stuff and then shelf them forever like everyone else

[2:46:58] <+emVulpine> @MisterRockett Her biggest reference point for a Shade besides Tyrann is Hook, who definitely is fucking with her and killed her grandmother, so she probably just distrusts all Shades no matter what they say.
[2:47:02] <%RaziWraith> the couch is slowly devouring you
[2:47:03] <DSD24> @Monkeyweed21 Nah he's a BEar
[2:47:06] <Mangahero18> @Monkeyweed21 Leprecaun
[2:47:12] <AmericanaRed> where's the box shibuy4Kirby2
[2:47:16] <yourliteraldog> Cub to be more precise
[2:47:17] <+Macbutters86> ah gotcha
[2:47:17] <%MisterRockett> @Macbutters86 She can understand the Shades. So like, I'm assuming all of it.
[2:47:19] <+emVulpine> Also, Kaine doesn't know what Shades really are.
[2:47:25] <+emVulpine> She just can understand what they say.
[2:47:39] <$realm_forge> I’ve never seen Elmo be that cuddly before
[2:47:39] <%captain_thickthighs> @Monkeyweed21 too wide for twink and to old for shota. so manlet?
[2:47:43] <+Macbutters86> I still mostly blame Devola and Popola
[2:47:44] <datlambo458> farming for the pheonix spear is hell but worth it
[2:47:44] <tattleworm> easier, not easy
[2:47:49] <balthazar758> @monkeyweed21 orange gremlin
[2:47:50] <KaironFortressKnight> @monkeyweed21 Shota + twink = Shonk
[2:47:51] <Daniel_Is_I> You can come back for it later
[2:47:55] <Mangahero18> do the loot tables change between playthroughs??
[2:48:02] <%Lion_kun> I JUST GOT MY 4TH EAGLE EGG
[2:48:10] <%Lion_kun> I AM FREEEEEE
[2:48:12] <+Macbutters86> id go with "bear" honestly
[2:48:19] <Louie_Salmon> Farming for the Phoenix spear has been made much easier in this version
[2:48:22] <%baronouroboros> Nier Skywalker
[2:48:28] <peyodogo> @Lion_kun 🙏
[2:48:33] <%Lion_kun> THREE HOURS OF FARMING WAS WORTH IT
[2:48:35] <peyodogo> 🥚
[2:48:38] <DistantPower> not too sad about killing these shades
[2:48:39] <mannywatcha> Damn just killing all them kids and families.
[2:48:40] <%Breaknoon> @Louie_Salmon Really?
[2:48:43] <%Monkeyweed21> So the answer seems to be Bear Cub cuz Pat is tiny yet hairy
[2:48:48] <%RetroCop87> why has it become so hard to find DLC store pages on the PS5?
[2:48:54] <%captain_thickthighs> i thought bear was also a stature ting
[2:48:55] <brachydios777> I grinded for the pheonix weapond in path A by selling royal fish
[2:48:56] <Sol_Install> I forgot how much nier loves puting a game within a game within a game
[2:49:00] <+Macbutters86> nooooooooo
[2:49:02] <Mangahero18> I tried for 3hrs to get my third Eagle egg before throwing up my hands and using a trainer to just give me a bunch of the rare items.
[2:49:07] <+RyTYoung> !uptime
[2:49:07] <@Moobot> @RyTYoung I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 49m.
[2:49:09] <Louie_Salmon> @breaknoon They're a drop in one of the new areas
[2:49:13] <Ethel9727> Those dastardly shades must have killed all the humans and eaten their bodies
[2:49:16] <+Macbutters86> don't kill the babies
[2:49:17] <+D00msDayDan> hey look it's that merchant from the hit video game nier automata
[2:49:18] <+evbites> And then yoko got his symbol
[2:49:19] <mannywatcha> Its not important anyway they shouldnt have kept swinging.
[2:49:20] <%averyoddjew> THERE IT IS
[2:49:22] <%Breaknoon> Alright
[2:49:28] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt sure were a lot of small ones in that kid looking place...that's weird...
[2:49:30] <%captain_thickthighs> but if the zombies are sentinent, age and reproduce whats the difference
[2:49:35] <+Macbutters86> aren't shades just nobodies from Kingdom Hearts hehehehe
[2:49:36] <LordOfThePoultry> BIG LORE
[2:49:36] <OkamiDude15> @D00msDayDan well yes but no
[2:49:41] <%cvp5127> MY MIND
[2:49:43] <%athuramn> you don't say weiss
[2:49:45] <%RetroCop87> there's a room on the second basement floor that's good for getting the 100 combo achievo
[2:49:54] <Louie_Salmon> I find it poetic that humans couldn't save themselves with magic, but found the time to make weapons with it.
[2:49:55] <%baronouroboros> Emil is experiencing PTSD right now, I'm fairly sure.
[2:49:57] <+evbites> @captain_thickthighs they are sterile cuz i dunno know
[2:49:59] <%RetroCop87> this one, actually
[2:50:04] <brachydios777> no, their heartless
[2:50:05] <KaironFortressKnight> time for murder
[2:50:09] <%ringabal> They're so small and killable!
[2:50:14] <%Ranryu692> dropping schoolbooks
[2:50:23] <reonome> HMMMMMM
[2:50:24] <JetpackMcQuack> destroy
[2:50:24] <$Faustgesicht> Oh cool Hades dlc
[2:50:25] <%Torus1025> It's dope
[2:50:27] <DSD24> Hey they are attacking Nier
[2:50:29] <datlambo458> coloring books all over the floor
[2:50:32] <AmericanaRed> shibuy4Aqua shibuy4Emilia shibuy4Uzaki
[2:50:35] <brachydios777> •They're
[2:50:36] <DSD24> Peace was never a option
[2:50:36] <HeroToxiko> It's like taking candy from a baby
[2:50:37] <datlambo458> right in front of a playground
[2:50:39] <+TacticalTwerk1ng> as easy as beating up a kid on the playground
[2:50:39] <%cvp5127> must have stolen them
[2:50:40] <LordOfThePoultry> @Louie_Salmon well they almost saved themselves if nier hadn't fucked it all up
[2:50:44] <+Macbutters86> @baronouroboros no worries. he'll forget it all in about 10k years
[2:50:46] <shinichizio> Weirdly dissonant sad music too! Huh
[2:50:48] <datlambo458> what could it mean!?!?!?!
[2:50:48] <+evbites> This is the best place to farm xp
[2:50:49] <%Monkeyweed21> THEY HAVE THE REEFER ON THEM
[2:50:50] <%solracc25> must kill the shaldren
[2:50:51] <inutaihanyou123> @louie_salmon wasnt that the whole point of the project lol saving themselves
[2:50:51] <DSD24> @brachydios777 My bad
[2:50:54] <%Monkeyweed21> THEY MUST DIE
[2:50:55] <%RetroCop87> I'd feel bad, but shades are literally attacking all animal life
[2:50:58] <OkamiDude15> i cant believe these horrid shades would take the belongings of the children they killed
[2:51:00] <%tactician0> begone demons only humans allowed
[2:51:07] <%captain_thickthighs> @captain_thickthighs so my brain memory is running on fumes but if the cant reproduce how are you gonna get enough bodies
[2:51:10] <Smokin_Fish> Just kill them, they're mindless monsters
[2:51:10] <AmericanaRed> THEY FIGHT LIKE WLITTLE KIDS shibuy4Uzaki shibuy4Uzaki shibuy4Uzaki
[2:51:11] <Daniel_Is_I> They're coming right for us!
[2:51:16] <Mangahero18> @captain_thickthighs The Replicants actually DONT reproduce and probably cant. On the wiki it states that since the Replicants have no frame of reference for normal families Popola and Devola units take them into a clinic, tell them they are going to have a child then knock them out and give them a freshly cloned replicant infant.
[2:51:17] <HeroToxiko> Dastardly
[2:51:19] <JetpackMcQuack> half color them all
[2:51:19] <datlambo458> @RetroCop87 only the ones that have lost their sense of self
[2:51:21] <Ethel9727> Look, that shade is even defacing the coloring book!
[2:51:23] <RiverBirch> Shades = Coloring Books
[2:51:26] <%averyoddjew> SO EVIL
[2:51:31] <%Agami23> a gacha game
[2:51:32] <DSD24> Its a phone game right?
[2:51:36] <+D00msDayDan> @Louie_Salmon stopping chlorination wasn't the only problem they had at the time
[2:51:39] <+evbites> Draken gard 4
[2:51:39] <$Faustgesicht> Now here's a question: at this point in the story, does Neir know that shades can be reverted?
[2:51:39] <VidulaSaix> I saw a video somewhere of Zero in Reincarnation and she looked dope
[2:51:39] <blackbookalpha> ReIncarnation are just contained stories
[2:51:43] <%JohnAtDawn> Yeah, and it's why I don't play his games
[2:51:43] <%Maids4lyfe> it's a gacha game
[2:51:44] <%Ranryu692> did you pre-register for Reincarnation?
[2:51:46] <%captain_thickthighs> @Mangahero18 oh so like that aeon flux movie
[2:51:47] <Louie_Salmon> He's gotta remake the Drakengards now, right?
[2:51:48] <%RetroCop87> Reincarnation has been out in JP for a couple months now
[2:51:50] <%Torus1025> He has tricks we haven't seen yet 100%
[2:51:50] <tattleworm> have you seen what nier's canon name is in reincarnation? @PatStaresAt
[2:51:52] <%AzureGale> Nier Reincarnation is a mobile game with gacha elements
[2:51:52] <Psyramics> and they've been popular enough for him to gain notoriety about it
[2:51:52] <HeroToxiko> nier 4: just a normal story where oops you were hitler
[2:51:54] <+RenoDeGeneric> Did you see what he said he'd do with Monster Hunter?
[2:51:54] <datlambo458> Do we know when that takes place in the time line?
[2:51:56] <brachydios777> But actualy its heartless and nobuddies
[2:51:58] <Mangahero18> basically yea
[2:51:59] <%Agami23> did you see that yoko taro monster hunter rise hsit?
[2:52:02] <+MooseIsGoose> He just makes a normal game and it is the best one ever
[2:52:02] <%ringabal> He's clearly gonna do crossover shit
[2:52:04] <%athuramn> his new trick will involve cast members breaking down your door to act out cutscenes
[2:52:05] <Tracazoid> Next time he just deletes the PS, Xbox and PC's OS altogether
[2:52:05] <TioXyco> Oh, the pre register is up?
[2:52:06] <BlueLunecy> Time for gacha
[2:52:09] <%MisterRockett> Drakenguard 3 flipped it. You're playing as a character who seems super evil but is actually the hero and is justified in most of her actions.
[2:52:12] <KaironFortressKnight> just remake drakengard plz
[2:52:14] <hat_under_bread> Just let everyone know that you're a monster from the beginning, like LISA.
[2:52:15] <%weissguard> LUL
[2:52:17] <%spitelite> what if he made a regular game to fuck with us
[2:52:18] <%tactician0> @patstaresat he's working with master hunter next can you believe it
[2:52:18] <Ethel9727> "I don't care." Yes you do
[2:52:19] <AmericanaRed> YOKO TARO x METAL GEAR shibuy4Piccolo
[2:52:19] <+Mrbaconator> EWWW it's a mobile game
[2:52:20] <UberKingKai> I have a few hours in jp reincarnation
[2:52:20] <OkamiDude15> @datlambo458 it set so fucking far in the timeline
[2:52:21] <sonicblade38> @PatStaresAt maybe his trick will be zero bad ending no matter what
[2:52:22] <yourliteraldog> Character we send you irl text messages from unkown numbers
[2:52:22] <%AzureGale> Can't wait for the Tales collab
[2:52:23] <%captain_thickthighs> but pat i kill potietal babies every lonely weekend
[2:52:25] <VidulaSaix> Get fucked LUL
[2:52:26] <%averyoddjew> yup

[2:52:35] <%baronouroboros> It's an escort mission.
[2:52:35] <%averyoddjew> when the teleport works too late
[2:52:37] <DSD24> Oh man I can't wait to get a 5 Star 2B
[2:52:39] <+emVulpine> Instant karma's gonna get you.
[2:52:40] <mr_saturday93> nier rencarnation is even weirder tbh
[2:52:42] <%averyoddjew> so fucking useless
[2:52:45] <DSD24> Think she's gonna be a Saber?
[2:52:45] <inutaihanyou123> @faustgesicht he doesnt know anything iirc
[2:52:50] <datlambo458> I want red eye war shit and itll never happen, which makes me sad
[2:52:51] <TioXyco> man, this top down camera reminds of Loaded, that old old PS1 game, remember?
[2:52:55] <JetpackMcQuack> I’d just give up and go back to drakenguard
[2:52:57] <KaironFortressKnight> @azuregale Wait really? who? velvet?
[2:53:00] <tattleworm> huh, i farmed the heck out of this place and i never got sent that far back
[2:53:04] <Ethel9727> Oh god, could you imagine a NieR/Drakengard and Monster Hunter crossover? "Just going to carve up this mass of children, ooh I got a gem!"
[2:53:06] <+evbites> lets lern about the darkside of earth
[2:53:08] <Mangahero18> Five Star 2B has an ass that will LITERALLY bring you to tears.
[2:53:08] <%Agami23> im worried about nier reincarnation, the last yoko taro phone game was a pile of shit
[2:53:16] <blackbookalpha> Taro did say in an interview that he understands his limits as a writer
[2:53:18] <CastellanVon> There's gonna be a Tales collab for Reincarnation?
[2:53:23] <%baronouroboros> Will NieR reincarnation be playable on the PC? I doubt it, but it can't hurt to ask now.
[2:53:25] <%Monkeyweed21> Yoko Taro will somehow exceed the final boss of Drakengard 3
[2:53:37] <+evbites> He loves entropey
[2:53:40] <Mangahero18> There WAS a sort of Automata crossover with MH World wanst there?
[2:53:50] <HenryHenshin> @baronouroboros you can emulate apps on pc
[2:53:51] <%NitronStreams> Damni it Emil do some cardio you big nerd

[2:53:59] <JetpackMcQuack> What a position to be in
[2:53:59] <%averyoddjew> final boss of his next game will require a guitar hero controller
[2:54:08] <mannywatcha> Does the music sound weird to anyone?
[2:54:17] <%Fooguwu> taro's next game you'll have to subject yourself to a fatal seizure via flashing images at the end
[2:54:18] <+evbites> @NitronStreams he's blind
[2:54:19] <%captain_thickthighs> babies have no personhood yet so its not murder yet

[2:56:54] <+evbites> you just need 40
[2:56:55] <+Kiaayo> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends you don't like androgynous dolls?
[2:56:57] <+rawblink> 99 but its useless to go that high lmao
[2:56:57] <mannywatcha> Why does this game have to make you feel guilty for every action you do?

[2:57:00] <+rawblink> kind of like golden sun 1
[2:57:07] <%RetroCop87> you'll be in 30's by end of route A
[2:57:08] <Tracazoid> I finished Replicant at 49 but it's 99 for max
[2:57:10] <Mangahero18> like in automata though 99 is excessively overleveled
[2:57:11] <%spitelite> but you are busted strong after 30
[2:57:12] <+BurningAc3s> snuffTail snuffTail
[2:57:13] <%Ascethetic> okay, Emil is stil Emil. answered my own questiom

[2:58:00] <tattleworm> yorha stuff's stupid
[2:58:01] <%RetroCop87> the virtuous weapons break the game HARD
[2:58:04] <+evbites> It was the first subversive jrpg where you are manslaughter  evil
[2:58:07] <%captain_thickthighs> @PatStaresAt i just realized the exact same twist happens in phantasy star portable and that came out two years before this game
[2:58:09] <+buffn99> The yorha weapons are strong
[2:58:09] <VidulaSaix> Yeah Normal is an absolute joke in this game. I'm glad I stuck with hard
[2:58:10] <+gitgouda> did you even need to?
[2:58:13] <JetpackMcQuack> Fist too stronk
[2:58:18] <OkamiDude15> @PatStaresAt hard mode gives a decent challenge
[2:58:22] <%NitronStreams> Wow pat I cant believe you picked the boss weapon
[2:58:33] <%averyoddjew> they start to fall off later
[2:58:34] <Mangahero18> This is no different than using Boss characters in a fighting game. You freaking cheater pat
[2:58:43] <AzureGale> ooh

[3:02:47] <BeezusHrist> @Mangahero18 if you showed someone who lived 200 years ago the shit you can do today, they'd call it... magic. That is the point of this game, it deconstructs "The legend"

[3:04:54] <Blank9> if they made magic just from a dragon corpse they'd go nuts with an elf

[3:05:17] <bonnobyxvii> So what I'm confused about is whether or not Emil can actually see while blindfolded or not. Because there's times where he can, but then there's times where he can't.

[3:06:40] <%AzureGale> KILL ME
[3:06:40] <+D00msDayDan> "somehow"
[3:06:40] <+Mr_Misanthropy> Phrasing
[3:06:43] <tattleworm> @PatStaresAt National Weapons Laboratory 07/24/2026 We have verified a level of compatibility between the donor bodies and the weapons brought in by the Accord Corporation. We will continue using them as subjects for research as we move forward with Project Number 6.
[3:06:50] <+evbites> Yoko taro rule one loli's ruin everything
[3:06:51] <deviljhojho_> leave it to a yoko taro game to leave new and important information in a loading screen
[3:06:55] <deviljhojho_> the what now
[3:06:58] <%athuramn> how was this the perfect weapon
[3:06:59] <LordOfThePoultry> DELICIOUS
[3:07:00] <JetpackMcQuack> Do the thing
[3:07:02] <%AllenDeadman> schlorp
[3:07:08] <+gitgouda> thicc thighs will save his life
[3:07:08] <VidulaSaix> Accord Corp eh? I didnt see that one
[3:07:16] <DSD24> Accord Corps
[3:07:18] <reonome> yum
[3:07:20] <mr_saturday93> Accord corporation!?
[3:07:21] <datlambo458> Yeah accord corperation is new and weird
[3:07:22] <%superc37> ACCORD CORP
[3:07:24] <JetpackMcQuack> I want you to **** me
[3:07:25] <brachydios777> Eh?
[3:07:25] <+buffn99> Accordporation
[3:07:27] <%superc37> RLY
[3:07:27] <+BIumen> @PatStaresAt There's another Accord entry and it is MUCH more concerning
[3:07:29] <%AzureGale> What was that line read
[3:07:30] <+Macbutters86> @athuramn same how Shadow the hedgehog is the ultimate lifeform
[3:07:31] <reonome> HE JUST GOT EATEN HOW IS THERE STILL TIME
[3:07:32] <+evbites> DAMN YOU TIME TRAVEL
[3:07:35] <ZeeJiggle> More like Accorp
[3:07:39] <%averyoddjew> don't worry, you can't kill them before the dialogues finish
[3:07:41] <%possumwalsh1221> Oh I also missed accord Corp huh
[3:07:41] <%Monkeyweed21> switch to a weapon that buffs your magic @PatStaresAt
[3:07:43] <%baronouroboros> Accord is just altverse Umbrella actually.
[3:07:46] <blackbookalpha> A-Corp
[3:07:47] <A_CD_By_Thomas> So is Accord just fucking around and doing whatever they want?
[3:07:47] <Louie_Salmon> Wait, accord CORPORATION?
[3:07:49] <+SilverDevilfish> Head Speen
[3:07:49] <%RetroCop87> So Accords wanted to create child weapons?
[3:07:50] <Djinnazz> gluttony is good for this fight
[3:07:50] <Mangahero18> The implication there is that Accord brought subjects from the 'other world' that Drakengard takes place in.
[3:07:52] <%Ranryu692> use a magic drop
[3:07:54] <primaryfire> dark gluttony is great for this
[3:07:56] <deviljhojho_> just type out the other accord text man dont leave us hanging
[3:07:57] <%athuramn> christ that broke me a little lmao @Macbutters86
[3:07:57] <deviljhojho_> wtf
[3:08:03] <+evbites> I love that she looks nothing like a girl
[3:08:03] <Daniel_Is_I> Did Accord go back in time to make sure Emil got created so he could fight the aliens?
[3:08:07] <+buffn99> tapping dark blast is really good
[3:08:07] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp orbs
[3:08:12] <ItsPastas> What is Accord's endgame then?
[3:08:15] <Fro5tburn> SourPls
[3:08:16] <+BIumen> Or was Accord built by the corporation which is why she's an android?
[3:08:18] <%pettydoggerel> Anyone else getting mad D. Gray-man vibes?
[3:08:20] <mr_saturday93> How many entires about Accord are in neir replica?
[3:08:21] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Can't you recover MP with melee
[3:08:21] <tattleworm> there's only the two accord texts, the accord corp one and the yonah one about the merchant
[3:08:21] <+evbites> @Daniel_Is_I ?
[3:08:22] <%Reaped_Psyche> You're so much better at video games this playthrough Pat.
[3:08:24] <%BoxNavy> accord corporation deals in weapons. accord the android goes around dimensions collecting and selling weapons from other worlds. 🤔
[3:08:25] <VidulaSaix> Yea tap dark blast is the best for pretty much everything
[3:08:26] <deviljhojho_> she is just doing random shit for the laughs
[3:08:28] <Djinnazz> @ItsPastas to stop the 'Fall Down'
[3:08:30] <yourliteraldog> Is emile that kid who can control the elementals
[3:08:34] <+BIumen> @mr_saturday93 at least 2
[3:08:34] <%ElkRiverDog> I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if it was revealed that Accord and Ada were the same person
[3:08:35] <datlambo458> does anyone know where to find the new loading screens
[3:08:35] <+chiazam> @PatStaresAt Doesn't hitting certain bubbles restore MP?
[3:08:36] <%Ranryu692> more likely that the Accord Corporation built Accord, guys
[3:08:41] <Blank9> accord's endgame is to cop a feel on a mad white haired lady and do silly dances, that's about it
[3:08:45] <%MisterRockett> So Accord brought in weapons but she didn't tell them to start FUSING THEM TO CHILDREN. Granted, given their powers she probably knew they were gonna do that.
[3:08:54] <%AzureGale> Emil has high WIS
[3:09:10] <blackbookalpha> That one Accord just wants a good ending
[3:09:13] <Mangahero18> If humanity had the ability to build a dimension hopping android they probably would have yeeted off their earth to avoide WCS.
[3:09:19] <primaryfire> remember magic power depends on weapon
[3:09:21] <A_CD_By_Thomas> I thought Number 6 was immune to physical attacks?
[3:09:27] <JetpackMcQuack> Hit until dead
[3:09:27] <+Macbutters86> I still blame Caim
[3:09:28] <+evbites> @blackbookalpha sucks for her.
[3:09:35] <%solracc25> Pod battle
[3:09:35] <mycoldshoulder> I hope the next nier is in kingdom of night and focused on accord
[3:09:38] <%Agami23> 5 accords in a trench coat.
[3:09:42] <Blank9> caim did nothing wrong
[3:09:44] <Djinnazz> @Mangahero18 we kinda sorta did.
[3:09:46] <VidulaSaix> Possibly
[3:09:47] <TonberryLives> Probably
[3:09:51] <+evbites> But time paradox
[3:09:52] <RetroCop87> I'd assume that if the world loop theory is correct, Accord is just around at every moment
[3:09:55] <deviljhojho_> keep throwing accords at the problem until shit fixes itself
[3:09:57] <HeroToxiko> all while slowly dying of chlorination, hmm
[3:09:57] <%superc37> caim did EVERYTHING wrong
[3:10:02] <datlambo458> Thats what it feels like, because they didnt do the gestalt stuff
[3:10:02] <%possumwalsh1221> Ooo maybe
[3:10:02] <%AzureGale> VICTORY ACHIEVED
[3:10:08] <%superc37> one of his best buds was a pedophile
[3:10:13] <%BoxNavy> caim accidentally did a wrong
[3:10:14] <%superc37> and the other ate babies
[3:10:19] <yourliteraldog> Caim why didn't you fuck your sister
[3:10:25] <Melchior_the_Wise> So is this first play through, or still 2nd?
[3:10:25] <+evbites> And a racist child
[3:10:25] <%MisterRockett> Or maybe they discovered the time loop and are trying to break it but every branch is even worse than the loop itself.
[3:10:30] <deviljhojho_> yeah but he was cool tho
[3:10:31] <%averyoddjew> oh yeah she talks now
[3:10:33] <DSD24> Halua is a weird name
[3:10:33] <%AzureGale> WAKE ME UP
[3:10:33] <%BoxNavy> pat...
[3:10:33] <%baronouroboros> I think it's possible that Accord was named after the Accord corporation or something. Basically, it all started there, then timeloops happened.
[3:10:34] <peyodogo> lmao
[3:10:34] <%Breaknoon> lol
[3:10:35] <moosemonkey397> thata kahlua

[3:10:46] <%RetroCop87> hey, why didn't Emil see Halua after his sidequest in Automata?
[3:10:47] <%AzureGale> I CAN'T WAKE UP

[3:19:47] <+evbites> fuck those twins
[3:19:47] <+chiazam> BACK TO SADNESS
[3:19:47] <%Reaped_Psyche> That was a dialogue change.  Before it's Kaine who says that "It's not as good as my grandmother's, but I guess it'll do".
[3:19:48] <nevan_44> :)
[3:19:50] <JetpackMcQuack> :(
[3:19:51] <+Macbutters86> does Emil full on "die" after his sidequest in Automata?
[3:19:54] <peyodogo> FUCKEM
[3:19:55] <%BoxNavy> ITS CRAP
[3:19:57] <%RetroCop87> they take out the wanting to kill them line
[3:19:59] <DSD24> Devola and Popola big heroes
[3:19:59] <VidulaSaix> Its not even their fault LUL
[3:20:01] <HeroToxiko> kicked the fuck out LUL
[3:20:01] <%Breaknoon> yeah, they make them sleep in the field
[3:20:02] <+chiazam> YOU FORGOT
[3:20:03] <%thedankestmeeme> FUCK THOSE HOES
[3:20:04] <%superc37> where popala just walks up to the gang and go "hey can we talk to yall for a sec"
[3:20:07] <+evbites> they dropped the ball so hard
[3:20:07] <%thedankestmeeme> IM PISSES
[3:20:08] <reonome> :(
[3:20:09] <+fetrigon> BRUUUUUUUHH
[3:20:11] <primaryfire> I live his delivery once he leaves the room
[3:20:15] <%BoxNavy> @Macbutters86 yeah
[3:20:16] <%athuramn> should just stab them right now and just be done with it
[3:20:18] <+Birdigalore> They fear the power of Kaine's big ol' dong!
[3:20:22] <%AzureGale> gdi
[3:20:23] <+gitgouda> no your not
[3:20:26] <%solracc25> What about Nier's house?
[3:20:27] <Louie_Salmon> I bet the twins are pissed these two are out and about
[3:20:27] <blackbookalpha> lol Emil has a MANSION
[3:20:29] <%Ranryu692> NOBODY LIVES ANYWHERE NEAR NIER'S HOUSE THOUGH
[3:20:29] <+tussletoes> this scene was really funny in the original. nier says YO DEVOLA we rescued kaine!!! and she just goes, that's nice. leave
[3:20:31] <%thedankestmeeme> smh sleeping outside
[3:20:31] <+gitgouda> your not sorry your maintaining buisness.
[3:20:32] <reonome> just kill them now
[3:20:32] <%captain_thickthighs> the village has zombies and is homophobic
[3:20:34] <HeroToxiko> But you protected them from "monsters"
[3:20:36] <+chiazam> SO THE FLOATING BOOK IS FINE, BUT NOT THISSSS!?!?!?!?!
[3:20:38] <%Maids4lyfe> I would just stab the twins
[3:20:40] <+BIumen> this has a darker subtext, popola is doubling down on her fuckups
[3:20:41] <+Macbutters86> @boxnavy suppose boy deserves to rest
[3:20:42] <%Breaknoon> just sneak them into your house bro
[3:20:44] <primaryfire> this voice actor is so good
[3:20:44] <LordOfThePoultry> FeelsBadMan
[3:20:49] <DSD24> Weiss has charisma
[3:20:49] <%RetroCop87> @Birdigalore actually, according to Devola, Kaine is put together "in all the right places"
[3:20:53] <yourliteraldog> Nobody wants to hang with magic ISIS
[3:20:55] <%athuramn> Imagine, not being allowed to live somewhere comfortably and drawing the ire of your neighbours for the way you look
[3:20:56] <+skyheys> I like how Dadnier literally thinks about murdering Devola and Popola
[3:20:57] <%captain_thickthighs> gingers ruin everything man
[3:21:00] <%trekkie11041> ray chase is killing it
[3:21:00] <gmbt21xd> I feel like this change was the oddest
[3:21:01] <mycoldshoulder> Ray chase is godlike
[3:21:08] <reonome> you'll get used to that feeling nierman
[3:21:10] <LordOfThePoultry> yeyeye fuck them both
[3:21:11] <%superc37> i miss the gestalt version dadnier dreams about choking her
[3:21:11] <gmbt21xd> @skyheys yeah they should've kept that
[3:21:12] <%thedankestmeeme> dammit kaine
[3:21:12] <%RetroCop87> doesn't want to kill them
[3:21:18] <JetpackMcQuack> Adult nier’s pretty cool
[3:21:18] <peyodogo> fuck them bothhh
[3:21:18] <gmbt21xd> Like they already kept so many lines
[3:21:23] <%tactician0> their big dick energy is too big for the villagers
[3:21:24] <+evbites> FUCK THEM TWINS
[3:21:24] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:21:25] <Fro5tburn> Kappa
[3:21:26] <%athuramn> devola and popola are real americans
[3:21:27] <%ringabal> YEAH THE POWER OF DOING NOTHING
[3:21:30] <%AllenDeadman> totally
[3:21:30] <%thedankestmeeme> DOUBTRD POPALA?!
[3:21:30] <+Macbutters86> I still blame Devola and Popola for everything
[3:21:31] <%AllenDeadman> sure
[3:21:32] <%Breaknoon> perspective is funny
[3:21:37] <OkamiDude15> @athuramn like the a couple hundred years ago or and even someplaces now?
[3:21:41] <%pettydoggerel> @athuramn oh gee wonder what it would be like
[3:21:46] <yourliteraldog> Actually way worse
[3:21:46] <bananawarrior1> when will you grow an aphro !!
[3:21:47] <mycoldshoulder> Kinda weird to say you wanna choke your parent figures, but sure
[3:21:52] <bananawarrior1> afro
[3:21:54] <A_CD_By_Thomas> #DevolaAndPopolaDidNothingWrong
[3:21:56] <%BoxNavy> what a horrible horrible man you are
[3:21:56] <scientiafidem> This scene does make way less sense when you remember that Emil has a literal mansion like 3 minutes away.
[3:22:01] <+Mr_Misanthropy> Did any of you consider Dr Zoidberg's feelings?
[3:22:02] <%Breaknoon> when people turn to pillars of salt
[3:22:02] <%Monkeyweed21> luciferol
[3:22:03] <%captain_thickthighs> im mean if i was him i would sleep with them outside in protest
[3:22:04] <%Agami23> wasent that rant more violent in the original?
[3:22:06] <%BoxNavy> red eyes D:
[3:22:06] <+D00msDayDan> RED EYES
[3:22:10] <primaryfire> kaine has slept inside for the past 5 years though :)
[3:22:12] <%superc37> @mycoldshoulder well happens to me all the time
[3:22:12] <%GalacticaPhanto> Angelus' angel dust
[3:22:14] <%averyoddjew> i blame original nier for all this.  if it was ANYONE ELSE that became the shadowlord, none of this would have happened and humanity would be alive
[3:22:15] <%thedankestmeeme> He so selfish
[3:22:16] <+Macbutters86> question. do the other villages also have android caretakers who "birth" more replicants?
[3:22:16] <Calamity2007> Red Eyes monkaS
[3:22:17] <%superc37> wait what
[3:22:20] <reonome> NIER IS RED EYES CONFIRMED
[3:22:21] <VidulaSaix> About an hour maybe?
[3:22:23] <Djinnazz> later
[3:22:24] <+D00msDayDan> after you do junk heap
[3:22:24] <%RetroCop87> it can be your first "quest"
[3:22:26] <tattleworm> beat lost shrine
[3:22:26] <Melchior_the_Wise> When?
[3:22:28] <%Breaknoon> next time you go to the junk heap maybe?
[3:22:28] <+chiazam> Has Pat gone for a swim yet?
[3:22:28] <OkamiDude15> soon
[3:22:30] <%Monkeyweed21> after the shrine
[3:22:30] <mycoldshoulder> well thats fucking weird
[3:22:30] <%averyoddjew> when you go to junk heap
[3:22:30] <%AyotoCorp> Soon-ish
[3:22:31] <Hamma526> when you go to the junk heap
[3:22:31] <+evbites> after the tower assault
[3:22:32] <%charp35> when you go there as part of the story
[3:22:36] <Daniel_Is_I> When you go to the shop for the main quest
[3:22:36] <Mangahero18> I like how no one ever questions these unchanging identical twins as their lords and masters. Devola and Popola are basically the defacto queens of humanity.
[3:22:39] <%AllenDeadman> when you get to see shitty brother again?
[3:22:39] <%bread_assassin> Beat the lost shrine again then choose to go to junk heap.
[3:22:40] <Calamity2007> It is a good idea to wait until you get access to B2 of the factory before grinding for upgrades
[3:22:41] <%TubeMan642> After you go to the shrine again
[3:22:45] <peyodogo> good shit
[3:22:45] <datlambo458> when you get sent to the junk heap for that quest
[3:22:49] <primaryfire> you can pick it as your first destination
[3:22:50] <%Monkeyweed21> you can do Sidequests now
[3:22:51] <crajoro2> I'm out
[3:22:51] <Calamity2007> And this is where I leave
[3:22:54] <%thedankestmeeme> wow im far behind
[3:22:56] <Calamity2007> I guess I should do it myself
[3:22:58] <peyodogo> i'm off then, yet unspoiled on the xiv nier quest
[3:23:03] <peyodogo> smell ya losers later
[3:23:06] <peyodogo> <3
[3:23:11] <+Macbutters86> @mangahero18 i always wondered about that
[3:23:31] <%pettydoggerel> Yup they're playing my song, ya'll see you later
[3:23:33] <Calamity2007> Hey I'm on Sargantanas if anyone wants to join me for the Tower raid
[3:23:45] <Fro5tburn> SourPls
[3:24:06] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @averyoddjew I mean, I don't feel like anyone else really *could've* become the Shadowlord, considering what we find out about Yonah and all that. Also I get the impression Noir deliberately singled him out because he was a great candidate, so there's that.
[3:24:18] <~PatStaresAt> no raid guy, just the weekly
[3:24:45] <%athuramn> o: he's here. but he was just... there...
[3:25:05] <balthazar758> pat
[3:25:19] <Blank9> everything really would've been solved if they could've grabbed an elf from the drakengard universe or something
[3:25:33] <Blank9> and just genetic engineer some elf blood into everyone, bam done no wcs
[3:25:36] <%Monkeyweed21> do savage coward
[3:26:11] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Honestly, I don't trust anything from a verse as fucked as Drakengard to not go bad if it mixes with white clorination syndrome.
[3:26:37] <%Monkeyweed21> elves aren't immune to pacts, didnt the lady in 1 make a pact with fire and water spirits?
[3:26:37] <Blank9> WCS is just the pacts they've dealt with in their universe forever
[3:26:44] <Mangahero18> Werent the elves creations of the Gods? And didnt the gods of that world DESPISE humanity because they were unpredictable and uncontrollable?
[3:26:49] <Holycow8498> Man the first was already extra fucked when it had light demons eating people then you add Darkengard to the mix
[3:27:10] <Blank9> they're immune to being forced into it, or at least they're definitely immune to red eye disease
[3:27:35] <Djinnazz> Earth god fucked hard, even discovered magic and we still got Thanos'd
[3:27:47] <brachydios777> Drakengard is super fucked
[3:28:08] <%weissguard> The ceiling lmao
