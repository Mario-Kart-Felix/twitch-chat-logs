[0:17:26] <%Frost_Quill> I don't believe that Pokemon Legends trailer.  It looks like it's 2-3 years off and that it's about to release in like a week at the same time somehow.

[1:04:27] <%Dunmarkh> KILL EM ALL PAT
[1:04:29] <%X2Eliah> WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT PAT
[1:04:33] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> did you pick up the guns?
[1:04:36] <%X2Eliah> WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO DO THAT
[1:04:37] <+hiswill98> Don’t reload
[1:04:37] <yourliteraldog> Now 47 looks like someone who is about to go on a incel rampage
[1:04:38] <%IAmAkiva> Yuuuuukiiii, will you be my loooooverrrrr??

[1:05:33] <%emperordread> his little red shoes are so weird
[1:05:33] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[1:05:38] <dukenux> "Dude, look at the shit i took"
[1:05:50] <sabata63> Hit the other guy with the bust to save time
[1:06:03] <dukenux> he'll drown
[1:06:14] <+MauriceFaurron> this mission is one of my favourite
[1:06:16] <bigben01> You lost Silent Assassin
[1:06:19] <$RealThiele> invincibility couch
[1:06:28] <%IAmAkiva> I bet Paige would like a RGB lighted toilet.
[1:06:31] <+PikeBot> I think one of the guards drowned in the puddle from the sink
[1:06:32] <%Tearonex> this bathroom is getting full
[1:06:32] <dukenux> huh?
[1:06:54] <+Javaa01> It could just be a visual glitch like last session
[1:06:56] <bigben01> When you pulled him over the couch
[1:06:58] <tanarath> couch?
[1:06:59] <thebehatted> maybe he saw the body on the balcony when he got up?
[1:07:01] <mortificent> can they drown from the puddle?
[1:07:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Couch
[1:07:05] <+Javaa01> Where it's showing you the wrong color due to a save load
[1:07:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> The indicator seems like it's been buggy. Maybe you still have it and reloading the save caused it to bug out?
[1:07:12] <+PikeBot> They can totally drown in puddles
[1:07:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Noisey ass Couch
[1:07:26] <%X2Eliah> Yeah the couch saw the guy getting choked and reported the crime.
[1:07:34] <+Javaa01> Remember to pick up any loose handguns on the ground so she doesn't freak out
[1:07:43] <mortificent> ohhh may maybe
[1:07:47] <+deathsmions1> i means japanese sword
[1:07:51] <rafaelba93> SAVE
[1:07:51] <+Javaa01> Cause she will report any and all loose handguns
[1:08:12] <%BoxNavy> :(
[1:08:32] <+PikeBot> If you shoot it once it'll start it leaking
[1:08:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> Erich is maybe one of the worst variations of that name
[1:08:35] <%emperordread> Yup, that's 1 of the 2 challenges
[1:08:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Ninja is Japanese For Hitman
[1:08:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> Any Erichs in chat I'm calling you out
[1:08:57] <yourliteraldog> hang off ledge?
[1:09:08] <%Taisuru> It's because you have a katana I think
[1:09:12] <%Taisuru> Drop katana
[1:09:38] <+Javaa01> Nah, bodyguards are allowed to hold illegal weapons
[1:09:41] <+Javaa01> Katana included
[1:09:45] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> quick hit her with a one liner
[1:09:48] <+Javaa01> Just not sniper rifles
[1:09:54] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> smoking kills
[1:09:56] <+CryptusMaximus> pulling her from the rail is funnier
[1:10:00] <dukenux> ow

[1:12:08] <@commanderclaw> That dude makes comics for Marvel and DC now
[1:12:10] <Zeif00> Dr Kay Tahna
[1:12:14] <%delilah4you> This was the only mission of 2 that I got silent assassin without knocking anyone one out or killing anyone but the target
[1:12:18] <%delilah4you> The ONLY mission I could do that with
[1:12:21] <thebehatted> you're positive! you've got the hiv!

[1:13:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> You know, this level having the very clear markers of who is allowed where was really nice

[1:16:45] <sabata63> THROW MELEE ITEMS
[1:16:46] <+PikeBot> Pat, important tip: throwing a blunt object at someone on stairs is a 100% relaibale way to knock them out safely
[1:16:48] <+ThomasOfTroy> Dog grumble sounds are always adorable
[1:16:48] <Hasigeddon> you can throw shit at his head
[1:16:49] <%X2Eliah> That is NOT ok
[1:16:49] <+beanieboi420> Stairs, the evilist of all
[1:16:51] <%IAmAkiva> dog asmr when
[1:16:51] <Protologo> everything you do on a staircase is broadcast to the world
[1:16:54] <Laecerelius> Hit him in the head with something
[1:16:57] <%JoshManVGH> @x2eliah That's why you NEVER see ninjas on stairs!
[1:16:59] <+shadowsvrse> LMJAO!
[1:17:00] <dukenux> D:
[1:17:03] <%AncelDeLambert> it appears to have worked
[1:17:03] <%AzureGale> He never saw it coming
[1:17:04] <%toolofparanoia> BONK
[1:17:04] <dukenux> rude

[1:18:37] <rafaelba93> gun is fine there
[1:18:38] <%toolofparanoia> Time to go skyward...
[1:18:39] <sabata63> YEAH THE DOCTOR
[1:18:48] <+beanieboi420> @thelonechris @comfyfox Y'all beat me to it lol
[1:18:49] <Hasigeddon> The doc will run away and the mission story will fail
[1:18:51] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> that's the swagger of a man looking for drugs
[1:19:00] <%Dunmarkh> WHAT IF A CHILD PICKS UP THAT GUN AND EATS IT?
[1:19:10] <%toolofparanoia> drugz
[1:19:24] <+beanieboi420> Child eat GUN
[1:19:25] <+A_Mighty_Walrus> @PatStaresAt grab the gun that's still down there
[1:19:30] <+applefibs> i feel like helicopters and surgeons both probably shouldnt be drug users
[1:19:32] <thebehatted> mate you've got a superrobot
[1:19:32] <Protologo> floorguns are normal it's cool
[1:19:39] <ComfyFox> @beanieboi420 XD great minds think alike
[1:19:40] <%emperordread> and a state of the art AI, he's forgetting
[1:19:48] <%Omegaanimus> doctors and nurses have a HUGE rate of drug abuse
[1:20:00] <%Mrbaconator> close sodas
[1:20:03] <xcompleasedad> CLOSE
[1:20:06] <+beanieboi420> @comfyfox Indeed!
[1:20:08] <+ThomasOfTroy> "Oops, I twitched a millimeter and caused brain damage"
[1:20:17] <thebehatted> into the body room
[1:20:18] <%JoshManVGH> Oh you gonna take his job too!?
[1:20:20] <%Dunmarkh> PUT THAT MASK ON
[1:20:22] <%sweetestbeefs> "man, we sure do have a lot of bald white guys on our staff team, crazy when you think about it"
[1:20:22] <rafaelba93> save tho
[1:20:22] <nilla_24> put everyone in the room xD
[1:20:23] <%emperordread> FORBIDDEN cigarettes on that man
[1:20:25] <%topendbuzza> body room
[1:20:25] <Ipsenscastle> given up on SA then, have we?
[1:20:25] <Protologo> phew he lmost made it to the stairs
[1:20:26] <%toolofparanoia> INTO THE CLOSET YOU GO
[1:20:28] <%DianaTheAscian> LUL
[1:20:32] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt Note how he too dropped cigs
[1:20:33] <JoshManVGH> Pat! you can't do every job!
[1:20:33] <%walternatorz> psaGib psaGib psaGib
[1:20:34] <%Dunmarkh> It's doing no good around your neck
[1:20:40] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt You know you COULD drag literally everyone into that room
[1:20:43] <+beanieboi420> Holy shit bro you fuckin killed him dude
[1:20:44] <%AnthroMetal> There's a pandemic rn, put your mask on!
[1:20:47] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> wait so chat is this a shutter island kinda deal?
[1:20:48] <%AncelDeLambert> "Don't mind me, I'm Dr. Badass"
[1:21:03] <%toolofparanoia> Pat is a man of many hats
[1:21:04] <thebehatted> one whole surgery
[1:21:17] <%AncelDeLambert> shouldn't all of these doctors recognize you don't belong here?
[1:21:17] <+MAD37> 47 has super powers, any disguise he wears he is good at that job.
[1:21:17] <%walternatorz> wash your hands
[1:21:19] <%IAmAkiva> Doctor Sugary. He has diabetes.
[1:21:31] <+beanieboi420> lol
[1:21:32] <%AzureGale> THAT
[1:21:33] <thebehatted> look at this evil science bullshit
[1:21:39] <dukenux> That's a Deus Ex bed!
[1:21:40] <fancypantlessteaparty> Ah yes, the surgery spider
[1:21:42] <%rytisone> go play surgeon simulator
[1:21:46] <sabata63> This level actually has one of the easiest cameras to delete
[1:21:56] <dukenux> This is how they rebuilt Jensen
[1:21:58] <%toolofparanoia> Time to horribly murder him with a surgery robot!
[1:22:01] <%ThirdWelles> I'm here and I'm living for the Hokkaido hype
[1:22:15] <+tigerfang86> oh no MEDICAL FRAUD
[1:22:17] <+beanieboi420> Agent 47 is...a cool doc from "Scrubs"
[1:22:18] <devanmuse> Scalpel... blood bucket... priest... Next patient!
[1:22:21] <fancypantlessteaparty> Well that was quick
[1:22:22] <%AncelDeLambert> robot systems like this would have safety limits that you would NOT be able to turn off
[1:22:24] <Protologo> it was an accident
[1:22:29] <xcompleasedad> THAT'
[1:22:32] <%ThirdWelles> I just wanna see watch Pat react to Miami
[1:22:37] <xcompleasedad> S NOT HOW IT WORKS
[1:22:43] <%Valdorick> It wasn't an accident.
[1:22:45] <thebehatted> HE WON'T STAY DEAD
[1:22:47] <dukenux> uhh
[1:22:47] <xcompleasedad> GODDAMMIT
[1:22:57] <+thelonechris> Turn that shit up to max
[1:22:57] <%sweetestbeefs> that is NOT how that shit works AT ALL
[1:22:57] <dukenux> okay, nothing suspicious then
[1:22:59] <dukenux> carry on
[1:23:05] <+hiswill98> Do Ghost in the Machine now
[1:23:06] <%X2Eliah> LAZARUS PIT
[1:23:09] <%toolofparanoia> FOILED BY THE FAILSAFE
[1:23:09] <%Valdorick> Its super science
[1:23:09] <linSP> SAM THIS IS HEARTMAN
[1:23:10] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> can't you just do it over and over again until the body gives in?
[1:23:11] <%IAmAkiva> He just died but lets resume like normal
[1:23:18] <+MAD37> You have to break KAI and it's sad when you start sabotaging it poor AI
[1:23:21] <xcompleasedad> It is so fucking EASY to do it right, and they NEVER DO IT
[1:23:22] <peachy996> You're the Todd from Scrubs
[1:23:23] <dukenux> THEY CAN REBUILD HIM
[1:23:23] <thebehatted> careful, don't let it overcharge!
[1:23:26] <%AnthroMetal> can you run over there after the initial sabotage
[1:23:28] <fancypantlessteaparty> I wish the objective got a check and then it went away when he got resuscitated
[1:23:29] <Tuna_Can_0> I am Mr. Docter man
[1:23:33] <%AncelDeLambert> the idea that there wouldn't be doctors manning EVERY last station during surgery is ludicrous
[1:23:36] <sabata63> Screwdriver, crowbar, wrench
[1:23:36] <%JoshManVGH> Time to knock out and assume the job of the surgical robot
[1:23:37] <Djinnazz> should be one in the morgue
[1:23:40] <sabata63> the holy trinity
[1:23:40] <%ThirdWelles> Time to backtrack for ten minutes
[1:23:43] <Hasigeddon> That IS Todd from scrubs
[1:23:43] <%X2Eliah> You now if you strap a defibrillator with a battery to your chest, and have it auto-trigger, you become immortal
[1:23:48] <Bigyanno> 3 things you always need, screwdriver, wrench, crowbar
[1:23:51] <%AncelDeLambert> you just would never put surgery on complete autopilot, it's asinine to think otherwise
[1:24:05] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> the gyme
[1:24:06] <+Double_Tap_That> That's why you should get into the habit of just picking up everything you see.
[1:24:13] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> you should go to the room if you dress as security
[1:24:19] <%X2Eliah> THATS A TERRIBLE GYM
[1:24:20] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> the gym rather
[1:24:23] <+Javaa01> @Bigyanno And unfortunately you can only start with one of those three
[1:24:24] <%X2Eliah> No heavy weights at all
[1:24:31] <%Omegaanimus> This system is AI ran, isn't it?
[1:24:34] <Hasigeddon> yeah true, just pick up everything you see
[1:24:38] <Bigyanno> The more things you have on you the more things you can yeet at people when they see you
[1:24:59] <sabata63> NOW YOURE LEARNING
[1:25:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> @X2Eliah They're ultra dense science weights
[1:25:05] <+vaderxyz1970> Wow doctor were you always so tall bald and Caucasian?
[1:25:06] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> why is he so pale?
[1:25:07] <+Javaa01> Uh, use the stairs
[1:25:08] <%ThirdWelles> @Bigyanno This is always my strategy
[1:25:15] <thebehatted> when jesse portman isn't a happy camper right now:
[1:25:15] <Tuna_Can_0> there's no shame in holding 3 wrenches and 5 sodas
[1:25:20] <sabata63> CHECK MAINTENTINCE AREAS
[1:25:30] <Djinnazz> that's what I always do.
[1:25:44] <+cafefunk> is that Frank Welker?
[1:26:09] <%monsieurfantastic> good thing everyone is the same height
[1:26:47] <+Javaa01> But now you are the surgeon, so get to cutting
[1:26:48] <+facenorway> you missed a room in there
[1:26:58] <Felto3> yu can do the robot cos you're head surgeon
[1:27:02] <+Double_Tap_That> NotLikeThis
[1:27:03] <+CryptusMaximus> Proxy kills are always my favorite methods
[1:27:17] <+hiswill98> You missed a room
[1:27:32] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> I really liked the little USB thing here. While it is part of a challenge it's not a mission story so you kinda have to feel your way through it
[1:27:54] <%X2Eliah> Most motherfuckers who smoke, love smoking
[1:27:56] <%topendbuzza> lol
[1:28:00] <dukenux> almost
[1:28:08] <+thelonechris> "It's like he's a murder-bot or something."
[1:28:13] <yourliteraldog> Goon closet
[1:28:18] <+Javaa01> "And this is where we keep all the guards"
[1:28:28] <+Javaa01> "For safe keeping"
[1:28:36] <peachy996> Oh hey tons o guards
[1:28:43] <+hiswill98> Go back to where you loaded the kill list there’s a room you missed
[1:28:45] <dukenux> ah sauna
[1:28:48] <peachy996> The Goon Platoon
[1:29:03] <Felto3> you don't need a wrench
[1:29:16] <dukenux> Budda Baby, make your dreams come true
[1:29:33] <Laecerelius> A hammer's just as good as a screw driver if you try hard enough
[1:29:34] <Protologo> i could break a defibrillator with a hammer
[1:29:37] <+thelonechris> That dude is a ghost
[1:29:37] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> the yoga instructor is a ghost too
[1:29:37] <%brickwall35> GHOST
[1:29:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> YOGA GHOST
[1:29:48] <Zeif00> SourPls
[1:29:48] <dukenux> this whole place is infested with ghosts
[1:29:51] <%Omegaanimus> yoga is crazy isn't it?
[1:29:54] <dukenux> this must be a shitty hospital
[1:29:59] <+MAD37> The AI one is sad
[1:30:00] <+facenorway> use the one you have disguise for
[1:30:02] <%Omegaanimus> is 47 a ghost???
[1:30:20] <Seraphim9> no he's a machine
[1:30:20] <+facenorway> Ye, do the surgury yourself
[1:30:20] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt The AI one is very difficult to set up at this point in the map, you need to become the hospital director
[1:30:20] <sabata63> ITS LITERALLY THE ONE PLACE YOU HAVENT LOOKED
[1:30:26] <Felto3> you missed something in robot control
[1:30:28] <+Double_Tap_That> You missed a room
[1:30:29] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Hey pat would you like to know some  horror I realised as learned to be an engineer
[1:30:41] <+facenorway> go to the room next to where you put the usb stick
[1:30:43] <+hiswill98> Go back to where you loaded the kill list
[1:30:47] <$realm_forge> This game would be legendary if someone modded Pat in place of agent 47
[1:30:49] <sabata63> DOWNSTAIRS
[1:30:52] <+CryptusMaximus> you missed a room in the place where you uploaded the list
[1:31:19] <nilla_24> very normal a doctor  hiding behind the bed xD
[1:31:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> good thing those doctors don't care you're being a creepy weirdo right now
[1:31:32] <Protologo> those two docs are just like "fuckin surgeons are weird"
[1:31:41] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> that'll do it
[1:31:42] <yourliteraldog> surgery
[1:31:48] <%brickwall35> LUL
[1:31:48] <+bugz_munny> problem solved
[1:31:49] <%IAmAkiva> I trhink you got him
[1:31:50] <%slimmixrp> LOL
[1:31:51] <yourliteraldog> with bullets
[1:31:52] <%sweetestbeefs> I DIAGNOSE YOU WITHDEATH
[1:31:52] <+shadowsvrse> lmao I love your style pat
[1:31:52] <+Javaa01> Too bad only headshot kills count for challenges
[1:31:53] <sabata63> 10/10
[1:31:54] <%sweetestbeefs> BAM BAM BAM
[1:31:55] <%JoshManVGH> SILENT ASSASSIN
[1:31:55] <Tuna_Can_0> mission accomplished :)
[1:31:56] <Wan6Saber> that wont work
[1:31:56] <dukenux> experimental surgery
[1:31:56] <%BoxNavy> pat... how are you so smart?
[1:31:57] <+Tuffty> Precise, just like a surgeon would
[1:31:59] <+CryptusMaximus> SERGUN
[1:32:00] <Hasigeddon> He might be dead
[1:32:00] <+Javaa01> So just lighting him up got you nada
[1:32:01] <%JoshManVGH> Big accident
[1:32:02] <%AzureGale> Take two bullets and call me in the morning
[1:32:02] <Felto3> if you go into there in suit you can just scare him to death
[1:32:05] <+thelonechris> I think you got him
[1:32:12] <+bugz_munny> muhahaha
[1:32:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> Do not worry everyone I am a medical professional
[1:32:14] <Protologo> elegant solution
[1:32:19] <peachy996> Directly into the Testicles
[1:32:25] <$realm_forge> That’s one hell of gallbladder removal
[1:32:26] <+Javaa01> You gotta do it in reverse order
[1:32:27] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> so use your chief surgeon knowledge to save him
[1:32:27] <Felto3> theres a super obsure easter egg that lets you play minesweeper here
[1:32:28] <+OhioNitsud> proper medical ventilation
[1:32:31] <Protologo> be dont need blood
[1:32:31] <+Tuffty> Save him Pat!
[1:32:33] <Tuna_Can_0> select 'horrible stabbing'
[1:32:39] <%JoshManVGH> Patient crashing! Administer 50ccs of HOT LEAD!
[1:32:48] <%Mrbaconator> the robotic wife arm
[1:32:50] <%GarbageNirvana> This is like a personal nightmare scenario of mine
[1:32:52] <fancypantlessteaparty> Too much blood in that patient, it can't be healthy
[1:32:55] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> @Felto3 for real? that's nuts
[1:32:58] <%walternatorz> that's not ominous
[1:33:00] <yourliteraldog> cool

[1:34:43] <%brickwall35> what's that smell?
[1:34:43] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> hospitals haunted
[1:34:43] <SomeAsianDood> time to run LUL
[1:34:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah that's super fuckin gnarly
[1:34:49] <%Dunmarkh> ROUND 3
[1:34:54] <Arek_1> monkaS
[1:34:55] <peachy996> Third stab is the charm
[1:35:00] <+Javaa01> I mean, I would imagine he's drugged the fuck up
[1:35:02] <Protologo> how was the doctor supposed to know he needed all that blood
[1:35:03] <+vaderxyz1970> hes uncaunsious
[1:35:04] <Hasigeddon> narcosis

[1:35:07] <%Mrbaconator> this sure is quite the raspy death snarl
[1:35:09] <%Mr_Pylon> probably drugged to the gills
[1:35:14] <%GarbageNirvana> Why is he conscious!?
[1:35:17] <Zombrocom> Are you doing this over and over again on purpose
[1:35:17] <%JoshManVGH> Please don't fuck up...
[1:35:26] <JoshManVGH> I don't think I can take that agaib
[1:35:27] <%sweetestbeefs> it's like a psychicpebbles scream
[1:35:30] <linSP> just trust the stabby robot
[1:35:34] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> who could possibly have used the chief surgeons surgery robot while the chief surgeon was with the robot
[1:35:35] <+Dunmarkh> ONE. MORE. TIME.
[1:35:35] <+Javaa01> @GarbageNirvana Pre-op treatment
[1:35:36] <Wan6Saber> @Zombrocom hope not!
[1:35:38] <+vaderxyz1970> @GarbageNirvana Brain surgery through the heart
[1:35:54] <+Javaa01> This is where the cameras are
[1:35:55] <%Livelinne> psaGiefrail
[1:35:56] <Felto3> theres a cool disguise in the morgue
[1:35:56] <%emperordread> Cameras definitely here
[1:35:57] <T_Sasquatch> You look like a character from scrubs LUL
[1:36:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> they are indeed down here
[1:36:07] <dukenux> There's a hilarious way you can pass this mission without even technically killing the guy afaik
[1:36:07] <+facenorway> it's near
[1:36:09] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> psaDogchamp_SQ
[1:36:15] <%Dunmarkh> Drink the stem cells, they'll make you into deadpool
[1:36:21] <peachy996> "Murder Five!"
[1:36:22] <%walternatorz> quick, free all the stem cell babies
[1:36:25] <+Javaa01> Along with his one of a kind replacement heart
[1:36:31] <Tuna_Can_0> WutFace
[1:36:39] <dukenux> Kill Bill ref
[1:36:44] <Hasigeddon> that would be exceptionally hard to replace
[1:36:44] <%Broken_Sonex> It’s across from that room the computer
[1:36:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> One of the mission stories is to smash that heart with your bare hands
[1:36:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> just fuckin crush it
[1:36:56] <+facenorway> look at your map
[1:36:56] <@commanderclaw> It's Flat Fuck Friday!
[1:36:58] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt Yes, what you thought about just now is a challenge, just gotta be good at smuggling that katana
[1:36:59] <Tuna_Can_0> D:
[1:37:00] <+plebeiusMaximus> Like a fucking wet paper towel
[1:37:00] <%IAmAkiva> Fat dog? Flat dog.
[1:37:03] <+plebeiusMaximus> Yeet it to the wall
[1:37:03] <yourliteraldog> Thats fucking brutal
[1:37:06] <%emperordread> cameras were just past the motorcyclist
[1:37:10] <+facenorway> it was right next to you
[1:37:17] <sabata63> IT WAS RIGHT THERE
[1:37:26] <%emperordread> yes
[1:37:27] <+plebeiusMaximus> yeah
[1:37:32] <+Javaa01> Use your eyeballs
[1:37:33] <+plebeiusMaximus> down here
[1:37:36] <HomebaseRED> room next to the biker
[1:37:36] <%Broken_Sonex> You were right next to the door to the cameras
[1:37:38] <Felto3> near the motorcyclist outfit
[1:37:39] <sabata63> also screwdriver
[1:37:41] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> past the motorcyclist
[1:37:41] <+facenorway> camera control, look at the one room you didn't go into
[1:37:42] <HomebaseRED> theres one guard
[1:37:45] <+Double_Tap_That> My favorite thing about this map is how all of the outfits also function as keys.  This also means that doing Suit Only Silent Assassin is tricky.
[1:37:57] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> the undiscovered room
[1:38:00] <Hasigeddon> past the motorcyclist
[1:38:00] <%emperordread> area undiscovered is it
[1:38:07] <HomebaseRED> the one with the location marker nex to the morgue
[1:38:10] <+facenorway> the one with the undiscovered marker
[1:38:11] <+Javaa01> It's the room with the google maps navigation icon on it
[1:38:33] <pi_in_the_sci> there's liker three camera rooms in this map
[1:38:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> I mean it's probably one of the most secure areas in this place
[1:38:48] <+thelonechris> It's that guy's job to stand over the recordings
[1:38:51] <+facenorway> usually like 2 per map, sometimes 3
[1:38:55] <%monsieurfantastic> doctor of death
[1:38:56] <%sweetestbeefs> oh man it was so nice of you to help him with his neck like a good doctor
[1:39:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> Considering it's 10 feet from all the super important organ storage and shit
[1:39:05] <sabata63> TIME FOR BAMES JOND
[1:39:06] <+Double_Tap_That> You can always get it next run
[1:39:11] <%JumboCrunchies> Camera server rooms near morgues will cut out on cooling costs. Only need to install one cooler and redirect it to cool both bodies and server bays
[1:39:12] <%sweetestbeefs> DOCTOR SNOWMOBILE
[1:39:16] <%IAmAkiva> brap
[1:39:18] <Tuna_Can_0> just a little chiropracting
[1:39:19] <$RealThiele> fly away to freedom
[1:39:25] <Wan6Saber> finally you leave
[1:39:27] <Protologo> the other snowmobile's for snake
[1:39:28] <HomebaseRED> the doktor is out
[1:39:31] <+plebeiusMaximus> "Hey why did the chief surgeon speed off on a snowmobile after the patient died?"
[1:39:32] <%walternatorz> "did that surgeon just take a snowmobile?"
[1:39:37] <+facenorway> Well done Dingus
[1:39:43] <%emperordread> big points
[1:39:54] <+kknutson4> I see Germanspy is playing Monster Sanctuary.  Pat you should play that shit.   Metroidvania-pokemon game
[1:40:09] <sabata63> especially sice it bugged out
[1:40:12] <Felto3> if you look at challenges theres a whole kill bill set with that motorcyclist outfit
[1:40:24] <dukenux> YES, Tell tale heart
[1:40:31] <Hasigeddon> why do you never smuggle items
[1:40:33] <BaronVonProlix> howdy pat, thanks for the company while i write 20 million essays
[1:40:33] <%sweetestbeefs> yeah, you gotta be mastery 4 to at least smuggle shit in there
[1:40:34] <Hasigeddon> oh nvm
[1:40:34] <+thelonechris> So nobody questioned the fact that the surgeon pressed some buttons on the console and ended up killing the patient?
[1:40:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> Telltale heart is pretty heardcore
[1:40:48] <+Double_Tap_That> Lockpick never hurt anyone
[1:40:52] <TrollKing96> I find it funny that 47
[1:40:54] <+Javaa01> @Hasigeddon Can't smuggle on your first time through a map
[1:40:58] <+facenorway> it will open lockers
[1:41:01] <%sweetestbeefs> i'd say emetic poison
[1:41:03] <+Double_Tap_That> There are boxes that you can pick to get itesms
[1:41:04] <Felto3> telltale heart is real good
[1:41:12] <+facenorway> gets you like coins and emetic poison
[1:41:13] <sabata63> lockpick accesses lockers youre too blind to find
[1:41:14] <dukenux> doesnt the phone allow you to hack locks
[1:41:16] <+Javaa01> Yeah lockpick is practically useless on this map, there's like less then a handful of things it can unlock
[1:41:18] <%sweetestbeefs> never know when you need someone to barf or shit
[1:41:19] <+CryptusMaximus> bring the snowball, no one will suspect it
[1:41:19] <+hiswill98> Snowball
[1:41:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> oops I wrote heardcore instead of hardcore lmao
[1:41:30] <%Livelinne> Snowball! shandLove
[1:41:35] <TrollKing96> I find it hilarious that 47's alias is Toby.
[1:41:43] <+thelonechris> Watch Dogs
[1:41:43] <+Javaa01> @dukenux This is not Hitman 3
[1:41:43] <BaronVonProlix> He sleeps like a robot
[1:41:47] <%Livelinne> kirinAhiruTaichou
[1:41:51] <dukenux> @PatStaresAt i dont know, but what else would it do?
[1:41:58] <%BoxNavy> this is gonna be a real yoga catastrophe
[1:42:11] <+thelonechris> Damn
[1:42:12] <dukenux> yes
[1:42:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> just take a huge dump in the sauna
[1:42:17] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> we don't want no sick people in this HOSPITAL
[1:42:17] <fancypantlessteaparty> "Alright class, time for corpse pose!"
[1:42:18] <%brickwall35> begone nasty
[1:42:19] <Tuna_Can_0> D:
[1:42:21] <peachy996> Yes Mr. Blum
[1:42:22] <sabata63> IN A HOSPITAL
[1:42:30] <dukenux> we don't want SICK people in this hospital!
[1:42:37] <Sunstalker> Damn, is baldness a disease now? kinamaSadcoffee
[1:42:37] <+thelonechris> "Get your ass back to quarantine."
[1:42:40] <sabata63> time for long way around
[1:42:44] <%Livelinne> Rude
[1:42:45] <+Shaotanzhiten> Isn't this supposed to be a hospital for the rich and powerful? Imagine some guard saying that to someone important
[1:42:49] <yourliteraldog> shoulda got the phone
[1:43:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> All the locked doors have icons for what disguise is allowed in @PatStaresAt
[1:43:02] <sabata63> TIME FOR LONG WAY
[1:43:21] <NeroInfinite> Piss in the hotspring
[1:43:23] <%sporeian94> Why are there men and women in the same sauna!?
[1:43:24] <Tuna_Can_0> just pee on some coals, that'll get people to leave
[1:43:27] <Djinnazz> you're thinking the 3 use circuit cards
[1:43:29] <+Javaa01> Those logos are on the backs of all staff outfits
[1:43:33] <GrizzMango> I never noticed those icons fuck
[1:43:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> maintenace and guard I think
[1:43:42] <%emperordread> handyman and gardener I think for those 2
[1:43:44] <+CryptusMaximus> you hack electronic locks with a key card you unlock later, not a phone.
[1:43:51] <%Livelinne> いいえ！
[1:43:53] <+Double_Tap_That> It helps to pick up any item you can since your inventory is infinite.  Even if they're not used for anything, they can still function as distractions or for knocking people out quickly/from a distance.
[1:43:58] <%Livelinne> That’s hilarious
[1:44:00] <+oktavia_von> im fine thank you
[1:44:17] <+Javaa01> Yeah that guy is the hospital director
[1:44:23] <+Javaa01> He is big important
[1:44:24] <%Livelinne> All these aesthetics screaming gaijin omg
[1:44:30] <dukenux> that means he's a captain doctor
[1:44:35] <sabata63> LEFT
[1:44:35] <%emperordread> The castest of systems in this hospital
[1:44:36] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> keep looking around up at the ledge
[1:44:42] <T_Sasquatch> Walking all over the finely raked sand
[1:44:55] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> towards the ledge
[1:45:07] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> I didn't find this until I had almost done all the challenges
[1:45:40] <dukenux> Naaaaails
[1:45:56] <+Shaotanzhiten> They all just get pods anneLol
[1:45:59] <dukenux> cute capsule hotel
[1:46:03] <Hasigeddon> one of those beds is very important. check all of them for items
[1:46:04] <yourliteraldog> Hive hotel
[1:46:07] <sabata63> DDDR
[1:46:08] <%AzureGale> Wow these are some suck-ass sleeping quarters
[1:46:14] <%emperordread> oooh go hang out with the man in the side room
[1:46:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> There's a laundry room somewhere near here
[1:46:23] <+Javaa01> Go towards your smuggled item, that's where it is
[1:46:47] <+PikeBot> GUy's listening to The Class on the radio
[1:46:53] <%sporeian94> WHy is he wearing underwear in the hsowe
[1:46:53] <umbraawitch> that man was just showering...
[1:46:53] <+FiePhi> Dude showering in his underwear.
[1:46:54] <%chiluzza> ahhh eh taking a shower in my underwear
[1:46:54] <%AzureGale> Showering in boxer briefs, nice
[1:46:54] <riiloseah> noone has an extra uniform i guess. everybody probably smells
[1:46:56] <+facenorway> that's nice, they released Jordan Cross's music
[1:46:56] <dukenux> thats what you get for showering in undies
[1:46:59] <devanmuse> Just shower in your boxers, eh?
[1:47:02] <Tuna_Can_0> @AzureGale I mean after a 10 hour shift I'd settle for the floor
[1:47:10] <%Pappajimbo> he must be a nevernude
[1:47:11] <Laecerelius> Look, he's a never nude, alright?
[1:47:16] <levitcleos> he's a Never Nude
[1:47:21] <+PikeBot> He's a Nevernude! There are dozens of us! Dozens!
[1:47:23] <levitcleos> lol
[1:47:24] <+Livelinne> Pants on?? psaPat
[1:47:36] <dukenux> ohey
[1:47:45] <%HaloPlayerNamedJohn> showering in my boxers cuz public bathing is disgusting
[1:47:47] <umbraawitch> pufferfish pog
[1:47:50] <dukenux> a callback to H2:SA
[1:47:57] <%Movemeister> Fugu monkaS
[1:47:59] <dukenux> i think
[1:48:00] <T_Sasquatch> Why would ANYONE try to eat it
[1:48:02] <%delilah4you> pogger fish
[1:48:16] <BaronVonProlix> death from BUEGH fish
[1:48:17] <Hasigeddon> @T_Sasquatch its REALLY good
[1:48:19] <%delilah4you> Some people are too rich for sense
[1:48:21] <Hasigeddon> to die for
[1:48:25] <linSP> fugoff with that fugu
[1:48:29] <%DianaTheAscian> whats a fugu?
[1:48:34] <%Livelinne> But fugu hotpot thooo... woolieGASM
[1:48:35] <@commanderclaw> These employee pod things are some real nightmare shit
[1:48:38] <dukenux> the risk of death makes it delicious
[1:48:40] <umbraawitch> pufferfish
[1:48:41] <T_Sasquatch> Oh boy this could poison me if the chef fucks up.  Guess I'll die trying it LUL
[1:48:43] <Hasigeddon> the fancier ones do have an item
[1:48:45] <yourliteraldog> I bet it dosen't even taste good
[1:48:47] <sabata63> It's a suit only rout
[1:48:47] <+Javaa01> @DianaTheAscian Poisonous as hell puffer fish
[1:48:47] <+bugz_munny> blowfish
[1:48:52] <majindusto> Fugu is a No go
[1:48:54] <+vaderxyz1970> @DianaTheAscian Something you don't eat at the Discount shushi bar
[1:48:59] <dukenux> @DianaTheAscian a poisonous(unless correctly prepared) fish
[1:48:59] <Hasigeddon> where you crawled through a window
[1:49:02] <%DianaTheAscian> @Javaa01 k
[1:49:07] <+bugz_munny> its a fish that puffs into a spike balll when threatened
[1:49:08] <%emperordread> The world is split into two, those who were old enough to see the episode of the Simpsons where Homer eats fugu, and those that were too young
[1:49:13] <umbraawitch> insanely poisonous fish unless it's prepared right
[1:49:14] <+applefibs> it has 1 highly poisonous organ and some kinda mediocre tasting flesh
[1:49:17] <Tuna_Can_0> grab some yeet soda :)
[1:49:21] <AdmiralButtloaf> deactivate surveillance while you're down here
[1:49:22] <+bugz_munny> extremely poisonous
[1:49:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> whoopsie lol
[1:50:01] <dukenux> basicly i think, it supposed to be a testament to chef's skill
[1:50:08] <%Livelinne> Longing for Japan makes me hungy
[1:50:12] <dukenux> if theyt can prep a fish like that and not kill their clients
[1:50:24] <%BoxNavy> peepee
[1:50:24] <+Skelegroove> apparently fugu aren't poisonous if farmed. They get all their toxins from the things they eat
[1:50:26] <umbraawitch> i feel bad for whoever has to test that out @dukenux
[1:50:29] <T_Sasquatch> Fap break PogChamp
[1:50:31] <%IAmAkiva> uh ohhhhhhh
[1:50:34] <%IAmAkiva> WHA HAPUN
[1:50:34] <Tuna_Can_0> sounds like a chef's russian roulette
[1:50:40] <mortificent> catJAM
[1:50:45] <Tuna_Can_0> puptime!
[1:50:50] <%Movemeister> SourPls
[1:50:51] <Arek_1> SourPls
[1:50:55] <%IAmAkiva> xivCactuar xivCactuar xivCactuar
[1:50:57] <%delilah4you> theres probably a way to know if its toxic before eating it
[1:51:01] <%Livelinne> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:51:04] <%delilah4you> like check for the chemicals or something
[1:51:07] <%IAmAkiva> xivGoob xivCactuar xivGoob xivCactuar
[1:51:08] <+shadowsvrse> thats fuckin sick animation right there
[1:51:13] <Tuna_Can_0> can mods add bttv emotes? or is it only pat
[1:51:13] <%delilah4you> i highly doubt its as dangerous as people make it out to be
[1:51:14] <%BoxNavy> fugu must be the tightest shit ever if you could potentially kill someone serving it
[1:51:16] <levitcleos> have the cat try it first
[1:51:28] <%delilah4you> Pat falling on his stupid face always kills me
[1:51:36] <dukenux> @delilah4you afaik the fish has a tiny poison sac, and as long as it's cutout intact it should be fine
[1:51:36] <TheFramedWarlock> Sup orb watchers
[1:51:40] <TheFramedWarlock> We hitting men ?
[1:51:40] <%BoxNavy> @Tuna_Can_0 only pat and hes too old to know how
[1:51:49] <%IAmAkiva> how can pat be cube when he ball though
[1:51:52] <%delilah4you> I mean, you could potentially kill people serving chicken
[1:51:56] <Hasigeddon> apparently eating fugu is like having your mouth fall asleep like your leg, but somehow desirable
[1:51:57] <Tuna_Can_0> @BoxNavy :( rip pugpls
[1:52:05] <%delilah4you> he's cubeall
[1:52:34] <TheFramedWarlock> If you're talking about Fugu fish then yeah, it has a poison sac you have to cut out but if there's even a tiny bit of it in there you're fucked
[1:52:35] <%monsieurfantastic> This is beat is so hard
[1:52:36] <%delilah4you> rich people are fucking weird
[1:52:53] <%IAmAkiva> wait not even he's a cube an orb and an egg all at once
[1:52:56] <%IAmAkiva> how
[1:53:12] <%delilah4you> Like i said, theres probably some kind of chemical check you can do on it to make sure you're not serving poison
[1:53:17] <%DianaTheAscian> glad i didn't buy the monhun rise collectors edition cause that amibo is kinda ugly
[1:53:29] <Arek_1> When they cut out the poison sac, are they conservative with it?
[1:54:02] <levitcleos> wonder if it has medicinal uses
[1:54:05] <%linSP> linSP subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! bruh! pat congrats on the engagement! :)
[1:54:07] <%delilah4you> "Fugu is served as sashimi and chirinabe.[3] Some[who?] consider the liver to be the tastiest part, but it is also the most poisonous, and serving this organ in restaurants was banned in Japan in 1984.[3] Fugu has become one of the most celebrated dishes in Japanese cuisine."
[1:54:14] <%Livelinne> Chefs know where the toxic part is, and must have the skill to remove the organs without damaging it.
[1:54:59] <BrickleBork> scottfScream
[1:55:02] <%delilah4you> "The restaurant preparation of fugu is strictly controlled by law in Japan and several other countries, and only chefs who have qualified after three or more years of rigorous training are allowed to prepare the fish."
[1:55:17] <Arek_1> @Livelinne Yeah, cut to not damage the organ. But do they cut a bit around the poison sac just to be on the safe side?
[1:55:18] <%Ziegsy> its poopy time?
[1:55:42] <peachy996> But what if the chef does an oopsie?
[1:56:02] <+MassConnect> I will never not pretend that Paige is tripping Pat deliberately in this BRB
[1:56:17] <%delilah4you> Between 34 and 64 people were hospitalized, and zero to six died, per year, between 1996 and 2006"
[1:56:26] <levitcleos> people have died from ill-prepped fugu
[1:56:44] <+predac0n> thats the old Hitman classic
[1:56:44] <%delilah4you> so its not that many and its not a guaranee you'll die from it
[1:56:51] <%Livelinne> @arek_1 There’s some YouTube videos out there which show the cutting step by step. It’s kinda fascinating
[1:56:53] <%Ziegsy> Is it a status symbol to eat fugu or is it SUPER tasty?
[1:57:00] <levitcleos> ...almost as if the chef is saying "fugu" to the customer
[1:57:16] <%Livelinne> Fugu is good
[1:57:18] <peachy996> I could never eat that and not think "but what if..."
[1:57:21] <+PikeBot> Apparently it actually is pretty tasdty; it's not Shark Fin SOup, which is disgusting and only used as a status symbol
[1:57:22] <Tuna_Can_0> Coconuts kill about 150 people a year, thats somehow more fatal
[1:57:27] <peachy996> Same with Skydiving
[1:57:35] <%Livelinne> Sashimi and hotpot is my rec
[1:57:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> I'd imagine if you accidentally poisoned someone you'd at the very least never be allowed near the fugu again
[1:57:47] <peachy996> I don't know how people can go through with skydiving
[1:57:58] <%Livelinne> Which doesn’t involve any organs
[1:58:00] <+Shaotanzhiten> Fugu is fine, good in hotpot but honestly so would any other very well prepared fish by a top chef
[1:58:08] <%delilah4you> People who eat fugu have more money than sense
[1:58:09] <+predac0n> it's fine though the only people 47 kills are really terrible humans....for the most part
[1:58:15] <peachy996> Has Skydiving mishap ever been a Hitman thing
[1:58:20] <%delilah4you> just eat catfish like a normal human being
[1:58:22] <%delilah4you> or squid
[1:58:25] <$Ziegsy> Skydiving, do you feel that same drop in your stomach you get on rollercoasters? Because thats a HORRID feeling
[1:58:29] <fancypantlessteaparty> Skydiving is not too dangerous, it's wingsuits that are lethal af
[1:58:36] <levitcleos> hard pass on "what ifs", Ricky Gervais has a bit about 'em. once you hit 35 and haven't done it, let it gooo...
[1:58:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> @peachy996 there's some parachute shenanigans in one of the Hitman 3 levels
[1:58:52] <%DianaTheAscian> I wonder what catfish is like
[1:59:09] <%Alazull> @DianaTheAscian The taste?
[1:59:13] <yourliteraldog> The sensation of going fast is what draws people to sky dive.
[1:59:13] <%Alazull> Ot
[1:59:15] <+predac0n> sometimes you just gotta make sure that parachute never deploys y'know?
[1:59:18] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah
[1:59:19] <%Ziegsy> @DianaTheAscian I apporve of your name
[1:59:20] <%delilah4you> "Five men were poisoned at a restaurant in Wakayama in March 2015 after specifically asking for liver."
[1:59:23] <%emperordread> @DianaTheAscian Catfish is bad eatin, they are ones to catch and release
[1:59:39] <%DianaTheAscian> @Ziegsy ty
[1:59:42] <yourliteraldog> I don't think I would sky dive but I am intrigued by going fast
[1:59:51] <%DianaTheAscian> @emperordread k
[1:59:55] <%monsieurfantastic> Pat poops at
[1:59:56] <%delilah4you> It seems like most of the people who get sick on fugu specfically request the liver, which is INCREDIBLY toxic
[1:59:56] <%Alazull> Catfish is alright, but most of the time it's about breading it and covering it up with sauces
[1:59:57] <Psyramics> Or just don't release, cause they're invasive
[2:00:01] <%Ziegsy> Arent there 6 foot catfish in the ganges from eating the bodies people float down it? Bet those taste AWFUL
[2:00:02] <%delilah4you> But rich people are stupid so cull them i say
[2:00:10] <+predac0n> just dont upset 47 he might sabotage your race car LUL
[2:00:19] <%delilah4you> Incorrect, you get a good flakey catfish thats properly fried MMMMM
[2:00:26] <+Shaotanzhiten> Besides the whole prep thing to not die, it's also notoriously difficult to prepare in general, cut too thick and it's tough, cook it for the slightest bit too long and it's tough; it's sliced way thinner than most fish
[2:00:38] <%delilah4you> a good breaded cod is also a thing of beauty
[2:00:46] <%Alazull> @delilah4you Exactly, fugu being expensive so it can only kill people with more money than sense makes it my favorite food
[2:00:57] <+PikeBot> Can we all just agree that fish, in general, are fucking delicious?
[2:01:00] <%delilah4you> Thats fair
[2:01:07] <yourliteraldog> I be more worried about the poop in ganges fish than if they were eating bodies
[2:01:10] <%delilah4you> im not the biggest fan of fish
[2:01:18] <%delilah4you> I'd rather have chicken or beef
[2:01:21] <+predac0n> mahi mahi is the only fish worth eating
[2:01:22] <yourliteraldog> So much dookie in that river
[2:01:24] <umbraawitch> hmmmmm fish is alright
[2:01:25] <%IAmAkiva> I like the firmer fish, tilapia, tuna, salmon
[2:01:33] <%Alazull> @delilah4you Agree to disagree on this one. Good catfish is good but I guess my point would be there are other really good cheap fish options out there
[2:01:33] <%IAmAkiva> I don't care for softer flesh fish llike catfish
[2:01:38] <Smokin_Fish> yes
[2:01:39] <+predac0n> yeah seasfood is meh except for shrimp
[2:01:41] <%Mendin> Yellowtail is fantastic, especially as sashimi
[2:01:52] <%Ziegsy> After seeing a fish farm irl I have my doubts about eating fish. I cant eat beef anymore after seeing those videos of cows playing in the snow

[2:47:48] <Jaysky> Controller CRUSH

[2:48:00] <huskarl_zap> >CONTROLLER ON PC KEK KEK KEK KEK KEK KEK
[2:48:10] <Zebroneath> that's some very impressive punching
[2:48:12] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt does the fist's stats scale with appropriate skill lvls?
[2:48:13] <%baronblank> is this seriously a starting class
[2:48:14] <fancypantlessteaparty> Fistomancer
[2:48:16] <Slam_Punk> I'm just saying his pad works fine
[2:48:17] <$RealThiele> controller on pc is hella comfy
[2:48:28] <Jaysky> @huskarl_zap I mean would you rather mouse and keyboard for Dark Souls?
[2:48:29] <Slam_Punk> and he hasnt reacted to the post malone pokemon content
[2:48:35] <Zebroneath> like, it looks like it feels real good
[2:48:37] <%AzureGale> This is like Yakuza: Dark Souls
[2:48:37] <MrHeph> controller is better than m&k for everything tbh
[2:48:38] <%Broand> Modding feels kind of janky by default tbh
[2:48:41] <MrHeph> except tryharding
[2:48:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> @baronblank Yes, you'd like 7 better because it's a different genre of game. Yakuza 7 is anime while Yakuza 0-6 are samurai movies
[2:48:43] <huskarl_zap> @Jaysky yep
[2:48:45] <Slam_Punk> haha...but why zoneZT
[2:48:50] <%sweetestbeefs> "oh, you're a summoner so you must be weak physically, right?" "nope, punch the heavens"
[2:48:56] <%Gamblitz> Man if only Harry Potter Punched Voldemort in the Face in the final battle
[2:48:58] <Jaysky> @huskarl_zap Heathen

[2:49:11] <%IAmAkiva> summon CBT punch
[2:49:11] <%BoxNavy> punch the space between his legs
[2:49:20] <Vadrigar1994> Holy shit this class is like half Monk

[3:01:13] <+Nannoko> Cinders is amazing
[3:01:15] <dan_g_v> oh, there's that
[3:01:16] <ExpressNode> Do they still ban people if this is connected to the internet?
[3:01:19] <$RealThiele> yeye giant woman
[3:01:19] <@SoFarFetched> @Slam_Punk you have to play Cinders Mod offline so "helping" doesn't make sense.
[3:01:29] <dan_g_v> so, this is the Pokemon build?
[3:01:36] <+shadowsvrse> not gonna lie thats rad!
[3:01:42] <%sweetestbeefs> BIG MAMA AND HER DOG

[3:01:52] <Slam_Punk> @SoFarFetched zoneChamp Shut up.
[3:01:55] <alroy900> fair and balanced
[3:01:56] <Kataiser> If you play online, your account gets banned, but the ban zone allows co-op with other banned people so you can still co-op the mod
[3:01:58] <Slam_Punk> HOW DARE YOU
[3:01:59] <%dekkitout> So issa summoner run
[3:01:59] <AShinyVagikarp> GG
[3:02:01] <%Taisuru> lol, no desummon animation
[3:02:01] <LVL1_Scumbag> This seems busted as shit
[3:02:05] <+Nannoko> @dan_g_v There are honestly too many changes to list. Enemy spawns are different, there are new classes, new spells, covenants (like the one Pat just joined), it's insane
[3:02:05] <Slam_Punk> anyhow.
[3:02:09] <%averyoddjew> i love the instant vanish when you banish them
[3:02:10] <%sweetestbeefs> big strong woman and a dog

[3:14:46] <+Dova573> man Hades is so much better than Transistor
[3:14:49] <%sweetestbeefs> so when do you get your next summon?
[3:15:07] <AnActualHermitCrab> I feel like every time I come back to Cinders, it's changed dramatically.
[3:15:18] <Pookiedaexzile> What Bosses can you summon
[3:15:20] <KaiserMario> You just ignored that item down there on purpose or was it blindness?
[3:15:23] <+Shaotanzhiten> Ham

[3:15:30] <+Dova573> summon? like ff summons?
[3:15:35] <%sporeian94> Firekeeper panties pls
[3:15:37] <ArcaneMusic> Wait, wasn't the top of the tower eyes of the firekeeper??
[3:15:50] <MookStyfawker> It was always the Firekeeper Soul.
[3:15:53] <Kitousha> Is there a mod that brings back Tarkus?
[3:15:57] <ArcaneMusic> Yeah that's unchanged from the original, I just beat this last week
[3:15:58] <Pookiedaexzile> EEETS BEEN
[3:15:59] <Zombrocom> So unchanged
[3:16:01] <AoiRob> no the eyes are in untended graves
[3:16:12] <Jontman42> how is the balance of Cinders currently?
[3:16:15] <+gag5y> Hoolow Head? like me (:
[3:16:34] <Sapphire_Breeze> it's terrible, it's actually fun
[3:16:37] <Pookiedaexzile> "Balance" LUL
[3:16:38] <%dekkitout> Balance? No such
[3:16:42] <LoreKeeper_Thal> perfect block boys
[3:16:43] <alroy900> balance is noneexistant
[3:16:44] <%AncelDeLambert> yep, inbalanced and FUN
[3:16:45] <AoiRob> i cheesed the fuck out of cinders before this recent summon npc nerf

[3:16:48] <%Artemis_Scowl> Perfect block?
[3:16:48] <+l3sovikk> My buddy was hitting 1600 ar with just dex on katanas
[3:16:49] <AnActualHermitCrab> i like when things are allowed to be busted.
[3:16:51] <Ultimatefool> Cinders just makes everything OP LUL
[3:16:52] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Just guards?
[3:16:53] <%sweetestbeefs> just-frame blocking?
[3:16:53] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck balance, PVP balance can eat shit
[3:16:58] <mustachegolem> that's the worse noise inve heard today, neat
[3:17:00] <Profmcstevie> Perfect blocks sound like Tinnitus.....coool
[3:17:01] <bonebagMEL> n i c e
[3:17:04] <%dekkitout> Do one ever really play modded for balance
[3:17:05] <PersonifiedTFT> just defend
[3:17:06] <+robosqueeb> seems reliable Kappa
[3:17:14] <%AncelDeLambert> or you could just, y'know, parry
[3:17:14] <Binary7> Probably quite doable to play through without taking damage with the right broken shit lmao
[3:17:16] <%Necnill> What form of power is this
[3:17:22] <+HefestoForges> HefestoForges subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! keep it up orbman, grats on the marriage <3
[3:17:28] <theaplombman> don't drop your shield
[3:17:29] <%AncelDeLambert> drink
[3:17:30] <%YakumoYomi> @dekkitout For PvP balance, yeah
[3:17:32] <%heartlesshealer> that's pretty cool
[3:17:34] <Jontman42> well yeah balance isn't really the right word, but there was a point where I felt like they went to a worse direction when it came to how much damage spells dealt and such
[3:17:35] <pitsuji> cinders is for your dark souls power fantasy
[3:17:37] <Kitousha> Parry nerds crying
[3:17:40] <%sweetestbeefs> you... did it
[3:17:43] <Jaysky> I just remember the DLC wasn't updated to match the Cinders stuff so it made Gael stupid easy
[3:17:56] <AoiRob> i like champion's ashes mod bc it has fully functional bloodborne weapons
[3:17:56] <redmoon108> tstyNoise tstyZappa tstyJojo tstyGuts
[3:18:11] <Jaysky> No no I don't know if it's still like that but it was before
[3:18:19] <Jaysky> I'd hope they fixed it
[3:18:20] <Skeletonmanners> pretty sure thats no longer the case now
[3:18:23] <%sporeian94> More like I'm gonna use it as a dying pan
[3:18:26] <%Broand> a frying pan so you can dead cells yourway to glory
[3:18:28] <%YakumoYomi> @AoiRob Same. I'm hoping they eventually add the Beast Claws
[3:18:44] <SaltyAzteca> DS2 gems, wow
[3:19:11] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> "you, me, pee pee"
[3:19:21] <Jontman42> like there's a difference between "this is unbalanced but fun" and "do they even know what they're doing" when it comes to how easy they make certain playstyles
[3:19:31] <%Broand> how many meme builds does this enable i wonder
[3:19:33] <AoiRob> also apparently champion's ashes mod is gonna make a branch that restores ds3's cut content? so i'm excite

[3:31:29] <A0N33> The Aquamarine Dagger's weapon art is ssick.
[3:31:33] <%Broand> That's where the aquamarine dagger usually is tho?
[3:31:35] <Binary7> Ah, i remember when hackers would force that effect on you, good times
[3:31:39] <Jontman42> dumb bullshit on your head is the true Dark Souls
[3:31:44] <+vaderxyz1970> squelch
[3:32:24] <MookStyfawker> I think the Souls community should deify whoever originally came up with the Old Monk's headwrap.
[3:32:24] <%DedlokPM> DedlokPM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 50 months! 
[3:32:30] <Laecerelius> Hahaha

[3:33:31] <%Tman451> bork busted
[3:33:55] <Binary7> Why not give you unlimited Ashen Estus or FP at this point

[3:35:09] <%spongeofmystery> Why is Pat's head a swirling vortex of darkness? Also what's up with his character model?
[3:35:25] <AoiRob> @spongeofmystery mod
[3:35:29] <%thotbane> why is his head black
[3:35:48] <SuperFightinRobot> Is Pat a Humanity?
[3:35:51] <+Ceromidas> hey does anyone know where pat got that knight summon? i didnt find that one here
[3:35:52] <$RealThiele> whys the first thing you notice is his black head hmmm?
[3:35:52] <%Dunmarkh> @LiquidDinosaur magic black face
[3:35:54] <%thotbane> what does it do
[3:35:58] <%YakumoYomi> Mod helmet (Mass of Humanity, I think)
[3:36:00] <Binary7> Oh, the humanity!
[3:36:00] <Dreziv> Pat is a mass of humanities
[3:36:04] <blue8moon> I think the knight just doesn't last very long
[3:36:14] <Dreziv> it increases his dark damage by like 2.5%, which is to say, it looks cool
[3:36:17] <Kingdudeacus> Shin Trudou
[3:36:52] <scrumbotime> You're that knight's assistant
[3:37:04] <+BigHooppaw> He's got advanced stage lice
[3:37:18] <Sapphire_Breeze> orb of blackface, the true nature of humanity
[3:37:22] <%YakumoYomi> Any way to heal the summon?
[3:37:31] <dinnydanny777> Headlice limesLurk
[3:37:49] <Kingdudeacus> rejuvinating phial
[3:38:06] <balthazar758> doggo...
[3:38:07] <Aydarkzero> does heal miracles work on Summons?
[3:38:10] <thepenguinprince> So that's just a reusable blue estus? That's strong
[3:38:14] <LoreKeeper_Thal> KANSEI DURIFTO!?
[3:38:29] <dinnydanny777> I can't believe they give you the power of the Dark Souls doggos
[3:38:30] <%spongeofmystery> kansei dorifto...
[3:38:39] <FutaSnek> mehdiPOG mehdiPOG mehdiPOG mehdiPOG
[3:38:42] <dinnydanny777> No one should possess such power
[3:38:51] <%YakumoYomi> Pogchamp
[3:39:17] <%Standard_Enemy> Is this the update that added the bloodborne guns to the mod?
[3:39:24] <LunarRemix> I just got here and I have no idea what's going on, it's all a mess of Souls stuff
[3:39:43] <%Tman451> those guns are so busted, its great
[3:39:48] <%Standard_Enemy> Aw shit lol
[3:40:00] <%Standard_Enemy> I need to check out the new shit then
[3:40:01] <%averyoddjew> i'm gonna do a gun build
[3:40:11] <RetributionP> why is pat a Kath fetish doll
[3:40:18] <%YakumoYomi> If you want Bloodborne guns AND functional trick weapons, then Champion's Ashes is the mod to use
[3:40:25] <+HitchhikingThrough> The fuck is all this "gun" nonsense ive been hearing about
[3:40:42] <%Tman451> a literal gun
[3:40:42] <%Dunmarkh> @HitchhikingThrough this mod adds guns
[3:40:48] <%Dunmarkh> pretty simple
[3:40:51] <dinnydanny777> Do the guns stagger or do big damage or are they useless?
[3:40:58] <%dekkitout> Guns, ya know the illest thing to hit the streets of Lothric
[3:41:02] <%Ascethetic> i havent had a chance to look at the updates in a while, what are some other cool stuff they added?
[3:41:06] <triggersqueeze1985> Bork
[3:41:16] <%Tman451> they do okay damage, I think the pistol does 100 or so, but you can rapid fire it
[3:41:17] <%Dunmarkh> champion's adds the trick weapons
[3:41:21] <AoiRob> yeah Champion's Ashes rebalances weapons for PvP and has better Bloodborne weapons
[3:41:35] <MookStyfawker> Before the gun violence Lothric used to be such a... okay, it was always a shit hole, now it's a shithole with guns.
[3:41:36] <+eanscrale> I care
[3:41:44] <%YakumoYomi> Functional trick weapons, tho!
[3:41:53] <LastnameSilverLastname> They added a bonfire here? That's kinda based.
[3:41:54] <AoiRob> it has Just Frame Blocks AND Just Frame Attacks
[3:42:04] <%averyoddjew> pvp, a thing you shouldn't do with mods in a game where they'll ban you because of it
[3:42:09] <%YakumoYomi> And feints!
[3:42:10] <%Dunmarkh> they're slaying the dargon
[3:42:18] <dinnydanny777> oh imagine if you could summon a Mimic limesLurk
[3:42:21] <%Emperor_Machinus> A literal gun is like adding an unknown predatory species to fragile ecosystem
[3:42:22] <thepenguinprince> Your minion build isn't working out very well
[3:42:23] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Once again, you should play the DS1 mod "Inferno Plus" that adds in Halo maps and functioning deathmatch and CTF.
[3:42:26] <MookStyfawker> I think they're trying to fight the dragon.
[3:42:26] <%dekkitout> @MookStyfawker In all realness, they deserve it for all the redlining they did to the undead communities SeriousSloth

[3:46:28] <MookStyfawker> Go to the sword side.
[3:46:44] <+HebbieJebbies> Fucking...
[3:46:44] <Dreziv> I had such an awesome build when I last played Cinders, with these lighting dragon fists, knight slayer ring, and aldrich's ruby, I was just punching people's shields and then riposting for hp, I felt like MGR Raiden

[3:47:31] <yourliteraldog> I see pat is now a gas cloud neat
[3:47:31] <+BigHooppaw> This really is big mamma's house
[3:47:33] <Parapattern> Imagine Paige switching over to this version
[3:47:59] <%TheWinged7> "we"
[3:48:02] <Binary7> It's just a normal Irithyll Knight from the looks of it
[3:48:22] <+marlborored5> wow the game really becomes trivial with these summons huh
[3:48:26] <Dreziv> yeah but if you try to fight one of those head on this early it's hard
[3:48:26] <+AzureZeph> blind lol
[3:48:35] <T_Sasquatch> Maybe i should've played ds3 with a shield instead sigh. This game is weird dual wielding
[3:49:15] <Tuna_Can_0> not with the sell sword win blades ^
[3:49:25] <%sweetestbeefs> dual wielding in DS2 was fuckin sick
[3:49:34] <%YakumoYomi> I might have to download Cinders again. I wonder how its summons compare to something like The Convergence mod
[3:49:54] <Dreziv> lol this stream convinced me very quick to reinstall DS3 and Cinders
[3:50:10] <MookStyfawker> Is the Mail Breaker good in ANY of the Souls games?
[3:50:18] <T_Sasquatch> @tuna_can_0 i tried those. It stopped being fun because it's just spam l1 plus this game has enemies that attack fast but your character has shit dodging
[3:50:31] <super_robo_mg> saintrBork
[3:50:35] <Dreziv> Mail Breaker I THINK has parrying, SOMETIMES?
[3:50:35] <Binary7> @MookStyfawker Yes, in DS3
[3:50:36] <%Taisuru> The summons are balanced by bad AI!
[3:50:45] <+BigHooppaw> You gotta give that dog a bath
[3:51:05] <dan_g_v> you'll end up with just bones if you wash that dog
[3:51:11] <Binary7> @Dreziv You're thinking of the Parrying Dagger probably
[3:51:14] <dan_g_v> the skin will fall off like a KFC piece
[3:51:20] <LoreKeeper_Thal> BALDER SIDE SWIRD
[3:51:25] <+BigHooppaw> @dan_g_v But he stinky

[3:53:20] <$LegendGHT> This area was very Bloodborney to me
[3:53:35] <Binary7> @MookStyfawker Still good for ripostes, stunlocks on smaller enemies, and the WA goes through shields
[3:53:36] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> That's a big ol health bar
[3:53:39] <dinnydanny777> Charnel Lane
[3:53:47] <%sweetestbeefs> this whole area is basically hemwick lane

[3:54:22] <devanmuse> Was that the game?
[3:54:24] <T_Sasquatch> @tuna_can_0 i wanted to play ds3 like bloodborne .... That was a mistake. I just wanted to play bloodborne LUL
[3:54:32] <%walternatorz> how is Pat drinking?
[3:54:37] <scrumbotime> I think it was Hemwick Charnel Lane so you had it, you just split it in half
[3:54:38] <%Broand> was that sword always that long
[3:54:40] <devanmuse> That "cleanse the bastard's curse"? That's... new
[3:54:56] <%sweetestbeefs> @devanmuse no, it isnt
[3:54:57] <%Dunmarkh> @devanmuse nope
[3:54:58] <Tuna_Can_0> @T_Sasquatch same lol, I remember using the dagger for the dodge alone
[3:55:01] <%Emperor_Machinus> That was there
[3:55:02] <T_Sasquatch> @tuna_can_0 also i use beast claw in bloodborne , it's literally just spam r1 yet its more engaging
[3:55:02] <dinnydanny777> They even get knocked back by rolling like the enemies in Charnel Lane
[3:55:07] <%Cameony> nah thats in base
[3:55:23] <%sweetestbeefs> you probably just havent heard it
[3:55:38] <Binary7> MACHETE
[3:55:46] <MookStyfawker> Your character looks like he washed up on a beach, grabbed a sword and kept on walking like nothing happened.
[3:55:49] <s1rcuit> I am back, what did I miss? Last thing I saw he beat the first boss as summoner

[4:03:04] <Tuna_Can_0> thrust Kreygasm

[4:03:11] <+BlackSunEmperor> thats not a dark soul!
[4:03:16] <sweetestbeefs> oh my god that is actually the tonitrus
[4:03:18] <CoffeeSlice> sacc
[4:03:23] <%AncelDeLambert> god I wish the tonitrus worked better in endgame Bloodborne, but it just didn't stay charged long enough
[4:03:48] <dan_g_v> stealth kiss that enemy!
[4:03:48] <%Broand> what covenant drops rat tails again
[4:03:50] <%Dunmarkh> wtf
[4:04:04] <%Broand> servant of clemps?
[4:04:09] <%AncelDeLambert> of course, it doesn't help that two of the best arcane weapons were NG+ exclusive, essentially
[4:04:11] <jbrachob> man i love his armor so much
[4:04:11] <%sweetestbeefs> you serve da rats?
[4:04:13] <MookStyfawker> I was half expecting the mod to just have the Curse-Rotted Greatwood in here when you took the cage.
[4:04:20] <jbrachob> the hat sucks but the rest is awesome
[4:04:23] <s1rcuit> this is that cave in Sekiro where you fight that ghost
[4:04:26] <%AncelDeLambert> does this guy make all da rools?
[4:04:28] <Binary7> Good ol Hodrick
[4:04:42] <%datKado> how are spell builds with non regenerating FP?
[4:04:53] <%AncelDeLambert> oh yeah, you can put weapon glamors on in this mod
[4:04:57] <%AncelDeLambert> I like the frost glamour
[4:05:03] <%datKado> nice
[4:05:11] <%sweetestbeefs> oh its just slower
[4:05:12] <MookStyfawker> Despite Hodrick being a freaking cheater he's one of my favorite NPC invaders.
[4:05:27] <%AncelDeLambert> there's rings that increase the regeneration, so your build'll use those
[4:05:29] <%sweetestbeefs> ew dex build
[4:05:30] <Binary7> There are probably several equipment items to regen it quicker
[4:05:41] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt gonna make your weapons pretty?
[4:05:46] <%datKado> seems slower, probably gear and infusions to boost it tho
[4:05:46] <Binary7> Ye thought so
[4:05:54] <Sloavon> How does Hodrick cheat?
[4:06:13] <mellorolo> hello
[4:06:18] <%spongeofmystery> hihg speed
[4:06:21] <%walternatorz> Propose marriage?

[4:06:32] <mellorolo> wedding rings
[4:06:34] <mellorolo> ?
[4:06:41] <MookStyfawker> Jacked tracking, his straight ahead charge attack can follow you almost at 180 degrees.
[4:06:48] <%sweetestbeefs> that A scaling is def worth it
[4:06:57] <mellorolo> whats a cinders mod?
[4:07:01] <%sweetestbeefs> that's crazy
[4:07:14] <%IAmAkiva> talk
[4:07:14] <%patriotrenegade> @patstaresat yo, you get the most powerful spell of all yet? Gun?
[4:07:22] <MookStyfawker> They did the same thing with Maldron in the DS2 DLCs.
[4:07:35] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Pat is worried about accidentally cutting himself on the sharp sword
[4:07:35] <mellorolo> Cheer500 whats a cinders mod?
[4:07:44] <@SoFarFetched> Its a Mod for Dark Souls 3
[4:07:48] <$LegendGHT> Nobody's talking about that Tall horror lady. KappaHD
[4:07:51] <T_Sasquatch> There's a ds3 tps mod LUL
[4:07:51] <Sloavon> I've played the game like 7 times and Hodrick  still gets me every time.
[4:07:53] <%Mendin> Maldron the Assassin
[4:07:54] <$mellorolo> no fuck
[4:08:02] <AoiRob> i turned around and pat's now an ammonite
[4:08:02] <@SoFarFetched> I mean if you wanna know what it is
[4:08:07] <LunarRemix> That's from DS2 I think
[4:08:08] <@SoFarFetched> you'd need to look it up,cause it has a SHIT TON of stuff in it
[4:08:13] <%IAmAkiva> blackweed does not make you smarter
[4:08:15] <%Emperor_Machinus> Study drugs?
[4:08:22] <@SoFarFetched> Like listing everything the Cinders mod had is a lot to list.
[4:08:25] <dinnydanny777> I like how the enemies go eee hee hee
[4:08:28] <%thotbane> wait are there straight up guns in this?
[4:08:32] <$mellorolo> @SoFarFetched ok.. now im interested
[4:08:36] <%Mendin> He shows up in Old Iron King by backstabbing you and running down into a monster pit. In Ivory King, he's disguised as a grey phantom
[4:08:44] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Cinders Mod makes the game go Wheeeee
[4:08:48] <monkeyonsticks> maldrons that invader NPC that pretends to be friendly at one point
[4:08:52] <%Mendin> He's an amazing asshole
[4:08:52] <super_robo_mg> no pat, Parrying is the best
[4:08:53] <thepenguinprince> Wait, what does a perfect block do?
[4:09:05] <dinnydanny777> @mendin Wait that sounds hilarious limesO
[4:09:14] <%ItsCaptainDisco> It's a mod that's designed to cater towards all build directions, right?
[4:09:15] <+blutzwavedave> It adds Cinder from RWBY into the game
[4:09:27] <MookStyfawker> I was replying to someone who asked about Hodrick having some slightly busted mechanics for extra difficulty. Maldron used the same gimmick in DS2.
[4:09:27] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah the mod changes a lot things
[4:09:31] <+Shadowofadoubt> yoooo
[4:09:31] <$mellorolo> @ItsCaptainDisco "Wheeee"? Kappa
[4:09:32] <AoiRob> @thepenguinprince no stamina cost
[4:09:37] <%WhereIsWill> thats dope
[4:09:39] <dinnydanny777> Wait Maldron is that guy? limesO
[4:09:40] <%Jekado> @mellorolo Yeah look up Cinders Mod for DS3 because there is a bunch of things added, like Bloodborne stuff and things from the old game.  even guns... for some reason and a bunch of tweeks and enemies rearranged
[4:09:42] <%Mendin> @dinnydanny777 Yeah the DS2 DLCs also crank up red phantom AI to do player-esque dickery
[4:09:48] <%Kitousha> Man, Estocs really are the best aren't they?
[4:09:52] <thepenguinprince> Wow! That's awesome. Risky, but awesome
[4:10:03] <Binary7> So it's like a parry with less risk, but without the riposte reward. No stamina consumption reward ig
[4:10:11] <%ItsCaptainDisco> @mellorolo Pat had a crazy dark build last time where he'd just shoot off tons of dark magic and then regen all his FP in seconds
[4:10:18] <$mellorolo> @Jekado wtf LUL foreals
[4:10:19] <AoiRob> @ItsCaptainDisco it's also the "EVERYTHING IS HERE" mod

[4:11:03] <%ItsCaptainDisco> @aoirob Can't wait for them to add tons of big tiddy sword girls to the game in the next updates Kappa
[4:11:06] <%Solarint> Im about to start Nioh 2, im kind of scared, that game looks so complex NotLikeThis
[4:11:08] <%Mendin> When he shows up as a grey phantom, he emotes happily at you, waves at you to follow him, leads you to a chest... and then backstabs you if you open it, before running the HELL away through a quarter of the level
[4:11:09] <fieriflavortown> Wait is that the Balder Swag Sword
[4:11:12] <dinnydanny777> Hey, hey, guy, wanna burn stuff? limesCorn

[4:12:04] <AoiRob> @Cameony Champion's Ashes mod has most bloodborne weapons
[4:12:08] <%MisterTylerrr> Penetrator's sword is OP as fuck
[4:12:09] <%Jekado> @mellorolo yeah some of the guns are from bloodborne and some are just random shit like an MP5 i think all which are generally "balanced" for the most part.
[4:12:09] <fieriflavortown> Beautiful
[4:12:12] <dinnydanny777> limesO
[4:12:15] <%Emperor_Machinus> Can you get one of those pots as weapons?
[4:12:16] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Is that the swored from da videogame??
[4:12:17] <%Mendin> Jester Thomas, the cool pyromancer summon from Harvest Peak, is an invader in the DLCs and opens up by mockingly taunting
[4:12:32] <SaltyAzteca> Infighting?
[4:12:35] <%Dunmarkh> LUL
[4:12:46] <%Dunmarkh> radiant ai
[4:12:48] <%MisterTylerrr> Are you online rn?
[4:12:50] <dinnydanny777> @mendin Jester Thomas is great limesPoggers
[4:12:53] <%IAmAkiva> it's too bad big mama's command grab doesn't work on anything but you
[4:12:56] <blue8moon> I guess she doesn't like the hollow guys
[4:13:01] <@SoFarFetched> @MisterTylerrr Cinders Mod has to be played offline or you get banned.
[4:13:13] <%EldritchNeko> YOOOOO hey pat!
[4:13:27] <cosmicdischarge> Zwaiii
[4:13:28] <Binary7> The aggro the white hollows in the base game too, you can kick em down there
[4:13:31] <%MisterTylerrr> @SoFarFetched I thought it then put you on a server with other banned folks?
[4:13:35] <%Emperor_Machinus> Breaking wheel
[4:13:37] <thepenguinprince> Are you going to do a full playthrough?
[4:13:44] <$mellorolo> @Jekado a "Ypu'll-Love-This-Shit" mod, i seeeee. :v

[4:14:10] <%MisterTylerrr> Good job
[4:14:17] <%Mendin> He already did a full playthrough of an earlier version
[4:14:20] <%EldritchNeko> Cinders is so awesome
[4:14:20] <blue8moon> very cool
[4:14:20] <T_Sasquatch> I loaded up my ds2 save from years ago.  It's pretty funny seeing just how much shit you collect and completely forget about
[4:14:23] <MookStyfawker> I was waiting for that.
[4:14:24] <%Mendin> owned
[4:14:26] <%Emperor_Machinus> Now it's lame and lack luster
[4:14:28] <%YakumoYomi> @MisterTylerrr It does, but then you're at the mercy of hackers. I think only Champion's Ashes players actively try to get banned
[4:15:01] <%MisterTylerrr> @YakumoYomi I realize all that, but I asked cause I didn't know why the mobs were righting each other
[4:15:15] <SaltyAzteca> Rats were soooo last year
[4:15:17] <%IAmAkiva> R A T  B O Y S
[4:15:19] <%Kitousha> we pray and stalk, etc
[4:15:20] <super_robo_mg> rats shouldn't attack you if you'
[4:15:26] <super_robo_mg> if youre in the rat covenant
[4:15:29] <%Mendin> DS2 itself may have a  variety of issues, but DS2's DLC is generally excellent
[4:15:38] <%paladin_leo> Aw man even the rats are evil
[4:15:44] <%patriotrenegade> @patstaresat Remember how Fallout 3 had a ghoul companion(meaning he’s radition resistant) who’s entire schtick was that he does anything the person who holds his contract orders of him and then had that companion refuse to go into a heavily radiated area to turn on a water purifier for no reason at all.
[4:15:48] <%Mendin> Ah, the giant rat that makes all of da rulez
[4:16:10] <$mellorolo> ty chat by the way :v

[4:18:04] <LordOfThePoultry> monkaS
[4:18:07] <%thotbane> @patriotrenegade the real clincher is how the DLC added the option to let Charon/Fawkes/the robot turn the machine on, but then in the ending slideshow Ron Perlman will be like "BUT THEN THE LONE WANDERER WAS A LITTLE BITCH WHO DECIDED TO NOT NEEDESSLY THROW THEIR LIFE AWAY, AND INSTEAD HAD ONE OF THEIR FRIENDS WHO ARE 100% RAD IMMUNE DO IT"

[4:28:49] <%spoiledbadger> spoiledbadger subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hey Pat! Long Time viewer, first time question! This has been a question that has been unanswered to my knowledge for quite a while; whatever happened to that second gurren laggan blue-ray box set from the mail bag?
[4:28:50] <%IAmAkiva> "Do I amuse you"
[4:28:58] <+Sendrak70> Hes done, you touched his balls. He has been offended.

[4:31:52] <triggersqueeze1985> “Drax suns”
[4:32:28] <%IAmAkiva> I'm the same way. Started with Yak 7 and am just about to finish up 0 and i'm overall just meh on it. I missed out on a lot of stuff though. Like the extra stances
[4:32:36] <%blutzwavedave> Thanks so much Pat!! He's gonna love that
[4:32:36] <%Dunmarkh> LUL
[4:32:57] <%Spydurman> Shit Nicky
[4:33:00] <mesamus> wait a second.....isn't that the guys that sent the gurren lagan bluray colectiors box?
[4:33:02] <+AWr00tBear> Pat are you going to play the MHRise demo v2?
[4:33:06] <%spoiledbadger> its a LONG list
[4:33:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Plus new ones
[4:33:18] <%AncelDeLambert> tonitrus is pretty good in it
[4:33:24] <%AncelDeLambert> spells are WAY better
[4:33:28] <Pookiedaexzile> GUNS
[4:34:03] <dinnydanny777> Relationships? limesLurk
[4:34:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Dick Size Slider
[4:34:28] <%spoiledbadger> I think Vawser got rid of relationships recently
[4:34:33] <Pookiedaexzile> WRONG
[4:34:56] <TonberryLives> You going to try the Blades of Ashina mod?
[4:34:59] <%thotbane> fuck superarmor i want to tank hits like the guys in the Cromartie High School intro
[4:35:23] <AnActualHermitCrab> Agreed.
[4:35:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Worst thing in Souls is the fact bloodborne doesnt have a sequel
[4:35:35] <SirDogBear> Bonfire Chan still best Souls Waifu BibleThump
[4:35:55] <%Emperor_Machinus> They tried to recapture the maiden in black unsuccessfully
[4:36:42] <%sweetestbeefs> the level design in ds1 is godlike
[4:37:02] <AnActualHermitCrab> Worst thing about the series is that Bloodborne is stuck at 30fps unless you mod your console.
[4:37:03] <dinnydanny777> Is Dark Souls 2 open world?
[4:37:05] <%spoiledbadger> pretty much yeah
[4:37:07] <FutaSnek> THEIF RING BBY
[4:37:09] <Psyramics> DS1 is an open world of hallways
[4:37:10] <FutaSnek> YOUR TOTALLY RIGHT
[4:37:15] <%AncelDeLambert> Dark Souls is a wonderful Metroidvania
[4:37:24] <%sweetestbeefs> being too linear is a huge problem in ds3 for me
[4:37:25] <FutaSnek> OR SHIT MASTER KEY I MEAN
[4:37:29] <FutaSnek> BRAIN DERP
[4:37:30] <SirDogBear> im worried Elden Ring will be amazing 3/4ths of the way then become complete trash last 1/4th LUL
[4:37:31] <TakesGuts> it's just gonna be bigger
[4:37:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Dark Souls is metroidvania, and Elden Ring is Legend of Zelda
[4:37:34] <%DappercatEsquire> I don't know if open world is an appropriate descriptor for Dark Souls
[4:37:35] <%thotbane> 2011
[4:37:39] <%MisterTylerrr> Elden Ring isn't real
[4:37:41] <%spoiledbadger> *2011
[4:37:46] <Jontman42> Dark Souls with horses
[4:37:47] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt i hope it still has a shitty swamp zone
[4:37:50] <FutaSnek> oof
[4:37:51] <%spoiledbadger> lol, thanks
[4:37:56] <dinnydanny777> They said stuff about horses though
[4:38:05] <MookStyfawker> Woolie stole it.
[4:38:07] <%DianaTheAscian> F
[4:38:08] <%spoiledbadger> i blame woolie, he's a lier
[4:38:16] <%DianaTheAscian> Woolie are it
