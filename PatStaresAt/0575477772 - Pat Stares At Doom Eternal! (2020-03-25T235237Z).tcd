[0:44:36] <Onmi_Khaos> Hey Sam, you keep saying "your people" little weird, man, shouldn't that be... our people. Right, because you're a big robot man but still human
[0:44:47] <%joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> Pat, you're supposed to shoot the enemies, not the walls and ground.

[0:45:17] <osiris1260> I think “your people” might be the sentinels honestly, but I’m probably wrong
[0:45:17] <peachy996> Haste+Infinite Ammo
[0:45:19] <ScreamLord> INFINITE AMMO
[0:45:19] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> INFINITE AMMO

[0:45:25] <%superc37> @spicyvibration I'm p sure that's Canon actually
[0:45:26] <SpaceGuntank> Speed Boost + Infinite Ammo
[0:45:27] <gazingeye1> by "Your People" he probably just means Doom Guys homeworld (alternate earth?)
[0:45:27] <boomstickery> thats the glowing orb of look at my big dick
[0:45:33] <xinexes> BFG
[0:45:35] <$numerohoowan> holy shit I didn't know that it also gave you infinite ammo
[0:45:36] <Mister_McDerp> FLIP
[0:45:43] <hntronium> Woud it have been infinite BFG ammo?
[0:45:43] <xinexes> oh its gone
[0:45:52] <%Master_Van> Master_Van subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[0:45:52] <$Dakuu75> I forgot, that yellow orb gives you unlimited ammo for the duration
[0:45:53] <%psychodave1234> those snake bitches just shred through your health and armor
[0:45:53] <$RealThiele> turns out rockets explode
[0:45:54] <VritraReiRei> does BFG work with infinite ammo 🤔
[0:45:55] <%Louie_Salmon> @hntronium That'd be too busted
[0:45:57] <TheAsianAvenger96> Hey Everybody
[0:46:06] <peachy996> Infinite Cheat Code works with the BFG so maybe?
[0:46:15] <ScreamLord> Remember when @PatStaresAt got the Unmakyr and never used it? That was cool
[0:46:15] <hntronium> @Louie_Salmon Would have been super rad though
[0:46:16] <Thetruestblacksun> BFG does I’m fact work with unlimited ammo
[0:46:18] <%Agami23> hey pat, i just watched my brother beat half life alyx. thats a good game. hope your ready for more vr half life forever
[0:46:19] <peachy996> Never tested the powerup with BFG myself
[0:46:21] <Thetruestblacksun> So does Sword
[0:46:22] <osiris1260> It doesn’t work with the BFG
[0:46:34] <Thetruestblacksun> The cheat code does anyway
[0:46:36] <gazingeye1> Doom Guy is from an alternate earth isnt he? since his people are all dead?
[0:46:37] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[0:46:40] <Monkeyweed21> GENIUS
[0:47:05] <hntronium> sure would be nice
[0:47:06] <$numerohoowan> @Agami23 what'
[0:47:08] <+lion_oh> What difficulty
[0:47:09] <%GraceTBM> the cheat totally works for the BFG and unmakyr
[0:47:10] <thegreatsun> Pat the floor slayer
[0:47:15] <$numerohoowan> what's pat's brothers' twitch?
[0:47:19] <%psychodave1234> i legit hate that you cant melee enemies to death anymore
[0:47:27] <osiris1260> The cheat but not the power up
[0:47:28] <%GraceTBM> numero @angriestpat
[0:47:35] <+thelonechris> LUL
[0:47:35] <%Louie_Salmon> Oh shit that works?
[0:47:38] <$numerohoowan> ahh yes
[0:47:41] <nazzynoeyes> @gazingeye1 Nah hes just human pretty sure
[0:47:55] <Saltmeisterr> does pat know he has to take out the shield?
[0:48:03] <%GraceTBM> doom slayer is human but trained by sentinels and juiced by a god machine
[0:48:04] <yorik1> so this is doom2016 with elemental damage?
[0:48:04] <peachy996> I love that these losers stick around
[0:48:06] <b_ikki> clearly he doesnt have to
[0:48:13] <%blondie_ow> blondie_ow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! ANGRY GINGER MAN KILLS DEMONS WOOHOO
[0:48:15] <Onmi_Khaos> Pat's decoded to just focus on the Sled
[0:48:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> I love energy shield
[0:48:25] <gazingeye1> @nazzynoeyes yeah he's human but they mention his people being dead. I assume that means an alternate version of earth
[0:48:28] <+Javaa01> It was a really easy mastery challenge tho
[0:48:36] <osiris1260> @saltmeisterr He doesn’t, breaking the sled disables the shield
[0:48:39] <Monkeyweed21> did you even read that
[0:48:43] <%psychodave1234> exactly
[0:48:48] <Saltmeisterr> but doesn
[0:48:53] <@commanderclaw> Next room is a fuck
[0:48:58] <%GraceTBM> his people are dead in this universe RIGHT NOW. most of earth is fucked, and so is everyone he ever met from doom 1 2 and 64
[0:49:00] <%Louie_Salmon> @yorik1 Fire and ice don't do damage, fire is for armor, ice is just to stop teleporters
[0:49:03] <VritraReiRei> naw but do it doh
[0:49:03] <+soullesskin> He’s not wrong
[0:49:04] <%OToole42> @PatStaresAt holy shit, you're dope at DOOM, didn't catch the other doom streams yet.
[0:49:06] <nazzynoeyes> @gazingeye1 Where is it mentioned out of curiosity?
[0:49:12] <Saltmeisterr> but doesn't the shieild increase damage reduction overall?
[0:49:21] <yorik1> like I said, elemental damage types
[0:49:25] <VritraReiRei> do it for the BIG DICK ENERGY
[0:49:29] <+Javaa01> The gun shield stops damage from the front
[0:49:34] <+Javaa01> Completely
[0:49:35] <Onmi_Khaos> I don't think the Slayer is from an Alternate earth, because a lot of like the Priests/Khan Mayker have been about "IT'S YOUR PEOPLE'S TIME"
[0:49:38] <Centrilion> Order Dank
[0:49:40] <Onmi_Khaos> Which is ya know... earth
[0:49:42] <Monkeyweed21> Angels cant go to hell
[0:49:44] <%GraceTBM> they're not damage types, the flamethrower does no damage, it's just to juice them to drop armor on hit and kill
[0:49:45] <Saltmeisterr> i mean for doom hunter
[0:49:50] <gazingeye1> @nazzynoeyes last stream they mention this earth being "another world/people you brought to extinction"
[0:50:01] <%Louie_Salmon> @saltmeisterr You can just go ham on the hoverboard, it doesn't have the shield on it
[0:50:04] <%GraceTBM> the ice bomb lets you do more damage to frozen types, but it's not a damage type
[0:50:10] <%Maids4lyfe> humans are from multiple worlds
[0:50:19] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?!
[0:50:22] <%Maids4lyfe> Earth and Argent D'Nur are just two of them
[0:50:26] <Thetruestblacksun> Aliens are confirmed, so imagine there other alien worlds
[0:50:28] <+soullesskin> Humans are the key!
[0:50:33] <yorik1> ice weapons literally freeze things like every game with ice weapons
[0:50:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> UPCOMING DROP AND DASH THROUGH WALL SECRET
[0:50:44] <Thetruestblacksun> I thought argents were aliens?
[0:50:45] <gazingeye1> i imagine alternate reality bullshit is at hand
[0:50:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> IT'S A BIG FUCK
[0:50:53] <King_Wolf_Rigger> real tough
[0:50:54] <%GraceTBM> freezing things isn't a damage type yo
[0:50:58] <%GraceTBM> it's a status effect
[0:51:02] <%Maids4lyfe> you can still be a human and an alien @Thetruestblacksun
[0:51:04] <yorik1> bro
[0:51:05] <heartlesshealer> 👏👏
[0:51:05] <ape_hawk> PARTAY
[0:51:09] <$numerohoowan> this is a great cheat
[0:51:10] <nazzynoeyes> @gazingeye1 yeh they say that because the DoomGuy's whole deal is that hes basically a genocidal anti hero for the sentinals
[0:51:10] <Mister_McDerp> argents are humans from another dimension
[0:51:11] <+Cavumentum> LET'S PARTYYYY
[0:51:12] <yorik1> just stop
[0:51:13] <osiris1260> DAISY
[0:51:14] <%Maids4lyfe> alien just means from another world
[0:51:16] <tiaramaki> THIS IS RAW
[0:51:16] <peachy996> Aw yeah this room
[0:51:19] <+Javaa01> Okay now's your one and only chance to get the archvile
[0:51:20] <ape_hawk> HOW. DO. YOU. KNOW. THIS. SAM?
[0:51:23] <enby_shout> is that the secret tape sound effect from THPS
[0:51:24] <Thetruestblacksun> Ooooh
[0:51:27] <%Farples> Fuck this room
[0:51:27] <+thefatfriend> I haven't been here since the start, can anyone let me know what difficulty Pat's on?
[0:51:27] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> !uptime
[0:51:27] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 51m 29s.
[0:51:29] <osiris1260> You missed daisy
[0:51:33] <%GraceTBM> ultraviolence
[0:51:33] <%Louie_Salmon> @yorik1 I mean, yeah, but elemental damage to me means like, water hurting fire for 20% more damage or something
[0:51:38] <Raulgb5> Ey how long has pat been playing?
[0:51:40] <boomstickery> its a bit evil
[0:51:40] <+WightTrash> Didnt sam spend the entire last game telling us how great argent is?
[0:51:41] <ringabal> So the Lifestream
[0:51:45] <bleugh> alternate uiniverses makes sense since the doom slayer's coffin is probably in doom 3
[0:51:48] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> So basically Argent energy = Human Souls
[0:51:49] <peachy996> There's nothing under those tarps, much like Hellraiser II
[0:51:51] <gazingeye1> @nazzynoeyes yes but they constantly mention him failing to save his people, I assume its an alternate reality of earth, populated by humans, destroyed by hell
[0:51:52] <%spiritofmojave> Sufferstream?
[0:51:53] <TioXyco> @Raulgb5 about 20 minutes
[0:51:54] <+thelonechris> Argent is people
[0:52:01] <+thefatfriend> dope, that's what my first playthrough was on
[0:52:03] <%GraceTBM> elemental damage also means DMC 3 where certain bosses had weaknesses to certain elemental weapons
[0:52:06] <Raulgb5> Thanks, i'll stay then :)
[0:52:08] <%BeatBo_2> this is like an evil version of the Lifestream from FF7
[0:52:13] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> pat be ready, Archvile is here
[0:52:17] <Daxalog> remember arachna challenge
[0:52:18] <samuelfisk> Reminds me of Berserk’s Vortex of Souls
[0:52:29] <yorik1> it's still specifically designed so that ice weapons are better against some enemies and fire is good against others
[0:52:33] <%Maids4lyfe> it was probably inspired by Berserk
[0:52:33] <peachy996> God Plasma Rifle is so good
[0:52:34] <ringabal> WRONG SIDE
[0:52:42] <j0ustar> it's clean energy! Recycled! Efficient!
[0:52:50] <%InugamiTheHound> Remember pat it was bethesda who invented the FPS and popularized thanks to wolfenstein, Doom and Quake
[0:53:11] <%Maids4lyfe> FPS games were originally called Doom Clones
[0:53:13] <Saltmeisterr> i love that they gave plasma more love
[0:53:15] <Monkeyweed21> LEFT SIDE {AT
[0:53:16] <ape_hawk> time for the challenge
[0:53:19] <peachy996> Go get Archie
[0:53:20] <samuelfisk> Re
[0:53:20] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> remember to glorykill
[0:53:22] <%Maids4lyfe> LEFT SIDE PAT
[0:53:26] <CrazyMedicine> Oh fuck
[0:53:28] <ape_hawk> GLORY KILL ON ITS LEFT SIDE, PAT
[0:53:30] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt AIM FOR HIS LEFT
[0:53:33] <%GraceTBM> @yorik1 fire does one effect against /everyone/: makes them drop armor. that's not actually related to fire. Ice bombs only stop enemies from moving. There's some that that's more useful on, but it's about the stasis not the cold
[0:53:34] <osiris1260> Sword him!
[0:53:49] <+Cavumentum> @PatStaresAt His Left, Your RIGHT
[0:53:49] <Josef_Stryker> So who's the worst enemy in the game and why is it Archvilles?
[0:53:49] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @InugamiTheHound Bestheda needs new upper manegment
[0:53:51] <+Just_GR> Holy shit that aim LUL
[0:53:52] <heartlesshealer> People yelling HIS left, YOUR right for the goal
[0:53:52] <%Louie_Salmon> This is such a silly semantic argument
[0:53:54] <mostundesired> How's it going fuckfaces?
[0:53:55] <%GraceTBM> no sword he needs the glory kill
[0:53:59] <Valegator> holy shit is that and Arch-vile
[0:54:00] <+Grohlski> sword does not insta kill super greats
[0:54:05] <heartlesshealer> F
[0:54:05] <%JonesMcFly> BloodTrail
[0:54:06] <osiris1260> Oh right, that challenge
[0:54:06] <%joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> How can you play video games so much but still be so bad?
[0:54:08] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[0:54:09] <+CampinSteve> oh wow doom with a controller is physically painful to watch
[0:54:11] <yorik1> yeah, it's a semantic argument, so you should stop making it
[0:54:12] <mostundesired> Okay, that answers my question
[0:54:13] <ape_hawk> sword instakills archie, yes
[0:54:13] <%BeatBo_2> nice try
[0:54:14] <+Javaa01> Just use the chaingun
[0:54:15] <TioXyco> fucking archville
[0:54:16] <%GraceTBM> sword totally instakills archvile and tyrant
[0:54:16] <ScreamLord> HIS LEFT YOUR RIGHT
[0:54:18] <+thefatfriend> Archvile was the exclusive receiver of my BFG for the entirety of the game, that dude can get fucked
[0:54:20] <%Maids4lyfe> sword does instakill super demons
[0:54:20] <osiris1260> @grohlski It super does
[0:54:20] <+Delenay> he does really good tho
[0:54:22] <BoneofMalkav> mricarSkel
[0:54:23] <Saltmeisterr> no sword instas all except marauder
[0:54:24] <+Grohlski> yo w h a t
[0:54:25] <%Agami23> hey pat, which is cooler, pinkie or specter?
[0:54:25] <%BeatBo_2> forgot remote detonation was a thing
[0:54:29] <%InugamiTheHound> @Maids4lyfe every FPS is doomstein game just like every 2d side scroller is metrovania
[0:54:29] <%BeatBo_2> thought you were missing
[0:54:31] <+Grohlski> oh shit
[0:54:34] <sappinmahbinyot> Archviles look just as annoying as they are in the classics
[0:54:37] <%GraceTBM> and no sword on first form doom hunter
[0:54:38] <+AtlasMcCoy> Ya I used a couple extra lives in this room
[0:54:39] <xxshadowxx416> pinle
[0:54:39] <peachy996> In my playthrough, Archie got the Chaingun
[0:54:39] <RyanTheRecluse> far as I can tell the cryobomb and flame belch do practically no damage, its all about their utility functions.
[0:54:43] <+republo> its kinda fucked that maurader just no sells the sword
[0:54:43] <%LadyTheWanderer> LadyTheWanderer subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[0:54:45] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> my your right?
[0:54:45] <%Maids4lyfe> @InugamiTheHound okay I love that word, doomstein
[0:54:52] <osiris1260> Apparently you CAN sword the Marauder if you stun him with a grenade
[0:54:53] <%GraceTBM> you're 100% right ryan
[0:55:05] <%GraceTBM> you CAN sword him after a stun?? that's crazy!
[0:55:09] <Mister_McDerp> doomstein < wolfendoom
[0:55:10] <Saltmeisterr> do archviles this have that hitscan shit?
[0:55:13] <%InugamiTheHound> @Maids4lyfe I remember mentioning it on the podcast.
[0:55:17] <peachy996> Yeah you got to heavily stagger the Marauder to do that
[0:55:17] <Saltmeisterr> still have*
[0:55:31] <%Maids4lyfe> you're right, I forgot they said that on the podcast
[0:55:33] <%TaphexWin> @saltmeisterr I don’t believe so
[0:55:34] <%Louie_Salmon> It's gotta be DoomEnstein, for the same amount of syllables as MetroidVania
[0:55:55] <+TaurusOxford> Archie putting in work.
[0:55:55] <jmepik> wolfendoom is better
[0:55:56] <+thefatfriend> have Pat's goblins allowed him to use the BFG or is it too similar to a consumable
[0:55:59] <%mighty_max_t> I just realized Archville does Repukens
[0:56:04] <%GraceTBM> chainsaw for free +20 health
[0:56:11] <ape_hawk> HAHAHA
[0:56:11] <+AtlasMcCoy> aylmao

[0:56:17] <Jolly_Adventurer> LUL
[0:56:17] <RyanTheRecluse> archviles don't have hits hitscan in this, just the fire line across the ground and the area denial attack
[0:56:17] <sappinmahbinyot> LUL
[0:56:18] <king_trito> FUCK
[0:56:18] <%joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> Bad
[0:56:19] <%BeatBo_2> you killed him too hard
[0:56:19] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, that's why this challenge is fucked
[0:56:19] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> rocket launcher is not good for that
[0:56:21] <$numerohoowan> I did this so many times
[0:56:21] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt Tap at him with the Unmaykr, that's the best for getting Glory Kills on Super heavies
[0:56:22] <%spiritofmojave> FUC
[0:56:22] <Mister_McDerp> don't use explosives
[0:56:24] <nazzynoeyes> I really hope if theres another Wolfenstien game, the team behind Eternal is on it. New order and old blood were fucking fantastic but Colosuss and Youngblood were huge letdowns :(
[0:56:25] <Shwepie> Heck!
[0:56:30] <Yummy_Nukes> Rocket launcher too strong
[0:56:33] <peachy996> Heated Gamer Moment
[0:56:35] <+republo> I reset the Urdak fight for the tyrant glory kill like 4x
[0:56:36] <Saltmeisterr> use combat or plas
[0:56:37] <%BeatBo_2> RIPPED AND TORE HIM TOO HARD, PAT
[0:56:37] <SovPho> This is one of the hardest rooms in the game tbh
[0:56:38] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYEYE
[0:56:43] <%InugamiTheHound> @Maids4lyfe no problem dude, doomstein sounds really cool same with wolfendoom
[0:56:43] <+AzureGale> Fight with bear hands
[0:56:47] <+thefatfriend> aight thats answered
[0:56:48] <gazingeye1> So, hypothetically, if after hell and the angels are defeated humanity encountered an evil/hostile alien species and ended up at war with them.....Would it be all that bad for humanity to fire up the Argent factory again? :P cos i feel like that's what Hayden wants.
[0:56:49] <osiris1260> The challenge hasn’t arrived yet, you might regret that reload
[0:56:52] <%GraceTBM> ID doesn't handle wolfenstein, that's machine games
[0:56:53] <%Niney_Who> Just Tap on him with the Unmaykr to do it safely
[0:56:56] <SovPho> @PatStaresAt he's there from the start
[0:56:57] <%Maids4lyfe> @InugamiTheHound it does LUL
[0:57:06] <SpaceGuntank> i love that the Archvile is classified as a "Super Heavy" Demon.
[0:57:10] <+Javaa01> He comes in after you kill the Arachnotron
[0:57:10] <RyanTheRecluse> as soon as you clear that central area he spawns
[0:57:13] <%Louie_Salmon> @niney_who But he has to save the BFG ammo for later
[0:57:15] <+AzureGale> I heard "this is raw argent anarchy" :x
[0:57:16] <TioXyco> Unmaykr.... The Unmaker
[0:57:17] <Saltmeisterr> hes a sneaky boi

[1:07:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...pretty much
[1:07:40] <RantingRavager> THE 1%
[1:07:42] <peachy996> Evil Techno Angels
[1:07:42] <WackyModder84> @Mister_McDerp, """""""ANGELS"""""""
[1:07:47] <Ultimatefool> The .00001%
[1:07:48] <mostundesired> Yeah... But it's read.
[1:07:49] <hntronium> she's high maintenance
[1:07:49] <Daxalog> Hell is Simp Zone
[1:07:50] <+TheBigO75> rip and tear
[1:07:50] <mostundesired> *ra
[1:07:51] <WackyModder84> And I cannot put enough quotations marks for that.
[1:07:51] <%GraceTBM> that's metal dude, on the nose
[1:07:51] <peachy996> More lore on that later
[1:07:52] <gunzerkingdunce> Eternal Smashability
[1:07:52] <%valriot> Why Kappa
[1:07:52] <%ShichiNoBushi> So angels are jerks, too. Not too surprising.
[1:07:53] <boomstickery> what kign did she make?
[1:07:53] <Mister_McDerp> fallen angels
[1:07:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> and CON maker
[1:07:55] <RantingRavager> EAT THE RICH
[1:07:57] <SpaceGuntank> yeah but eternal life tho
[1:08:01] <Monkeyweed21> Heaven went green by optimizing hell
[1:08:02] <%Dr_DangerPhD> subtext is for cowards
[1:08:04] <+Javaa01> Well yeah but she has the tech
[1:08:05] <%marsantas> You're suprised DOOM is on the nose?
[1:08:10] <Saltmeisterr> and they are BEES
[1:08:11] <peachy996> You'll get lore about Kahn Mayker later
[1:08:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> @RantingRavager RIP AND TEAR THE RICH
[1:08:16] <funkieboy> @patstaresat the main protag is called DoomSlayer seems right to me
[1:08:17] <%machshop> if you kill Satan do you become Big Satan?
[1:08:19] <%valriot> Genius Doomjumbo
[1:08:19] <Tha_Mik> It has to be more
[1:08:23] <WackyModder84> They are angels in name alone. If anything, they're more FALLEN Angels. But then that would raise the question of "Why wouldn't they be in Hell? Since Lucifer is a fallen angel himself."
[1:08:23] <Darkrenai> SOUL VORTEX
[1:08:24] <gunzerkingdunce> And I know what she looks like underneath, i'd still smash
[1:08:25] <+AtlasMcCoy> SOULNADO

[1:09:53] <+Cavumentum> Honestly all the lore about Hell kinda leads me to believe it's basically a massive fuckoff empire with so many worlds eaten by it that there's basically infinite enemies
[1:09:55] <%superc37> WAS THAT AN INVISIBLE PINKY
[1:09:57] <Onmi_Khaos> No I mean more than being a robutt
[1:10:03] <%Roundelay11> I really hope the next Doom introduces the Dark Lord as an actual character
[1:10:08] <CrazyMedicine> Jesus
[1:10:11] <%GraceTBM> there's invisible pinkies all over the place
[1:10:14] <%realm_forge> Never bathe in souls they get really touchy grabby
[1:10:15] <ape_hawk> guys, i think the plasma rifle is my favorite gun in doom
[1:10:18] <peachy996> Mancubus Sandwhich
[1:10:19] <%Ner234> Why was it red?
[1:10:23] <RyanTheRecluse> I mean if its actual Satan does that mean actual God is seeing this and just going "what the fuck is happening right now"
[1:10:24] <%GraceTBM> i'm glad theres no invisible imps like doom 64
[1:10:28] <%johnny_gogo> Big strong pat
[1:10:32] <osiris1260> The lore on Urdak is the best
[1:10:38] <ringabal> "Gee, I was almost a Doom Sandwich!"
[1:10:40] <%valriot> "You need to keep moving in Doom Eternal" Pat will succ the mancubus

[1:42:27] <%SpicyVibration> How could you have that much wax?
[1:42:29] <set29> I have that but its because of tinnitus
[1:42:32] <%Kilagn> Yes it happened to me like a year ago :(
[1:42:32] <%dekkitout> I'm pretty sure there's like a low acidity acid that helps with that
[1:42:34] <%spiritofmojave> Disgusting
[1:42:35] <nobody12349> Itchy. Tasty.
[1:42:35] <FeralFozzie> clean his ears and adjust his orb
[1:42:37] <mobiusnightshade> And then you pull out the earwax and it's the size of a gumball.
[1:42:38] <%Aleate> (I need to clean my ears regularly too, but don't tell anyone Pat- Wait is this thing on?)
[1:42:38] <%Dementedpenguin> I'm learning a lot about chat right now.
[1:42:39] <$numerohoowan> he will use that finger
[1:42:39] <osiris1260> No, because I take showers
[1:42:42] <bigdumbidiotguy> use a knife or icepick
[1:42:44] <boomstickery> how much wax people have and consistency is genetic
[1:42:44] <SovPho> if we aren't supposed to put our fingers in our holes WHY ARE THEY PERFECTLY HOLE SIZED?
[1:42:48] <Jakeofalco> uuuhhhg
[1:42:50] <taquito_blade> i blame having fat fingers
[1:42:50] <%UW_Duncan> I couldn't hear for 3 days once
[1:43:01] <gazingeye1> listening to loud music can cause wax build up to protect your hearing
[1:43:01] <%dekkitout> @SovPho I KNOW, RIGHT?!
[1:43:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sovpho Lewd people in a nutshell
[1:43:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> that happens to me often enough that I bought a stupid earwax disimpacting tool
[1:43:06] <%Storm_Samurai> Rip and tear that earwax out
[1:43:10] <%SpicyVibration> I had bad earwax when I lived in the city. If't the air pollution
[1:43:14] <Clyderso> delete earwax and snot
[1:43:18] <Clyderso> no one needs it
[1:43:21] <bigdumbidiotguy> I mix the ear wax into my milk and drink it
[1:43:27] <%Piemen99> stop
[1:43:28] <samuelfisk> SovPho, I can confirm from many years of trying that mine are not perfectly hold sized.
[1:43:28] <%dekkitout> If it's a hole things can fit in, then why not put things in it PunOko
[1:43:30] <%spiritofmojave> Why do I have to poop and pee honestly
[1:43:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> @bigdumbidiotguy DELET THIS
[1:43:35] <+NitronStreams> cease chat
[1:43:36] <%UW_Duncan> Had to use a Waterpik
[1:43:40] <zakti_prime> using ear buds and headphones excessively can exacerbate earwax generation yall
[1:43:42] <a_timberdoodle> look up 'labyrinthitis', I had that for almost a year, it was a fun time... nothing like being deaf in one ear and having the room careen around you every time you turn your head
[1:43:43] <%spiritofmojave> Just remove bodily fluids from reality
[1:43:56] <taquito_blade> patt would love that
[1:43:56] <bigdumbidiotguy> I use crusty old earbuds to stir my milk
[1:43:57] <osiris1260> You may not like Urdak, but what if they offered you Argent ear cleaners for your family
[1:44:03] <shotgang86> well now I know what new body fluid they will talk about in the next podcast
[1:44:15] <%solid_stro> doodBarf
[1:44:23] <Mister_McDerp> they already talked about ear sneezes
[1:44:31] <ringabal> Podcast title: Sell your Earwax to Light the First Flame
[1:44:32] <shotgang86> not ear wax
[1:44:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> I would legit Thanos snap earwax, snot, and unwanted hair follicles out of existence. Everyone gets to be baby smooth wherever they want.
[1:44:51] <bigdumbidiotguy> then I use a pumice stone and grind the heel of my foot into my blender and add some ice for a nice milkshake
[1:44:53] <%SpicyVibration> ear...sneezes?
[1:44:54] <%PhantomMiG> So Samuel in the old testament has another name which is Satan which just means the adversary or tester. Samuel the Angel is gods tester of humans based in Jewish tradition.
[1:45:00] <Mister_McDerp> I just wanna be pure Charlie
[1:45:03] <%ricky12k> So anyone got story to tell?

[1:47:15] <osiris1260> THE VOIIID

[1:47:40] <karl_rex> Just cuz
[1:47:42] <mostundesired> PogChamp
[1:47:42] <%alcors_wisdom> because it absorbs human suffering and earth is full of that shit
[1:47:43] <%Pyroclase> it's actively tearing apart reality to suck it all inot hell
[1:47:45] <nazzynoeyes> because of all the souls and human suffering :)
[1:47:45] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> and possibly hell energy
[1:47:46] <RyanTheRecluse> "I zombie trooper will be the one to beat doomguy!!!"
[1:47:46] <gunzerkingdunce> There's a bunch of hell energy steeping on Earth still
[1:47:47] <MasterTonberry23> Its sucking up argent energy. Or something. Shut up.
[1:47:47] <fairore> @mighty_max_t oh really ? ,how so?

[1:48:11] <%tigerfang86> HEADBUTT
[1:48:13] <%OkamiDude15> It’s sucking up souls and warping reality by EXISTING
[1:48:14] <bigdumbidiotguy> if you absorb enough human souls Fred Flintstone will ride a Brontosaurus to Wendy's.
[1:48:15] <%realm_forge> It’s sucking up all the hell energy on earth
[1:48:19] <%Valdorick> Man, Hell is AWFUL. It Hell floored this Angel Fucko's house REAL fast
[1:48:24] <FrankysDream> @PatStaresAt but more importantly he's absorbing bunny souls
[1:48:26] <MasterTonberry23> Ha ha, it sounded like that drone yelled out "hey!" before you crushed its face
[1:48:27] <AutechreTwinAphex> i think the game would have been better if it did like DMC5 did and just made the entire campaign "Bloody Palace the game" - all the platforming absolutely sucks
[1:48:30] <+BoboDaHobo> I like how everyone streaming animal crossing and doom this week just stops every two minutes to say some variation of "man this is a good video game, I like this"
[1:48:38] <duckmeister7> SPIN MOVE
[1:48:39] <+TheBigO75> Thats rare
[1:48:41] <peachy996> I love how Sam refuses to give answers in this and the Nekroval
[1:48:41] <osiris1260> I JUST NOTICED THE DRONES BLEED
[1:48:47] <%tigerfang86> SICK SPIN
[1:48:48] <karl_rex> THEY HAVE TENTACLES?
[1:48:48] <ringabal> SPIN TO WIN oh noooooo
[1:48:49] <peachy996> Partly cuz you didn't ask lol
[1:48:49] <%Niney_Who> I don't like that they have tentacles
[1:48:55] <%D00msDayDan> @osiris1260 they're not robot drones, they're slaves to the hive mind of the makyrs
[1:48:55] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt Protip: To defeat the icon of sin, shoot it until it dies
[1:48:56] <%mighty_max_t> @fairore Just the ambient noise sounded like the made-up nier language singing in one of the zone
[1:48:58] <+luketrapwalker> almost fucked it
[1:49:00] <%Niney_Who> AIM AT FEET FOR GLORY KILL

[1:49:06] <samuelfisk> I think it’s so creepy how the Makyr faces are metal but they emote like flesh.
[1:49:06] <MasterTonberry23> Ugggh can we sword this Marauder?
[1:49:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> F
[1:49:07] <Josef_Stryker> FOOLISHNESS SLAYER
[1:49:07] <%toolofparanoia> Since the Makyrs have tentacles would that make them old ones?
[1:49:10] <%dekkitout> "Squeezing blood from stone" takes a literal meaning when Doomguy's a factor
[1:49:13] <%valriot> CND aim LUL
[1:49:18] <+Javaa01> He saw that you had an extra life stocked up, and he can't abide by that

[1:49:42] <+khalcipher> dont forget the flametrower
[1:50:04] <MasterTonberry23> Anyone else feel the names for the Marauder and Doom Hunter should have been switched?
[1:50:11] <JonEWorldbeater> Wouldn't it be amazing if right at the end of all this they pulled a Silent Hill 3?

Or how Vega needed to be housed in the biggest machine ever, cooled by literal planetary glaciers?
[1:53:55] <$superc37> @patstaresat Wait hold on I thought one of the previous lore snippets said that demons couldn't set foot on urdak? so how come you're fighting them here?
[1:53:55] <heartlesshealer> YUP
[1:53:55] <%marsantas> Well he had to pay rent somewhow
[1:53:55] <%Literal___Nobody> WHY NOT?
[1:53:55] <%D00msDayDan> kidnap god and turn him into siri on your phone
[1:53:56] <%linkster291> Overkill?
[1:53:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> IT WAS BIG EFFICENT THO
[1:53:56] <a_timberdoodle> in DOOM 2016 they say VEGA's central processor has some mysterious arcane artifact in it
[1:53:56] <%spiritofmojave> hey why not LUL
[1:53:56] <JonEWorldbeater> Checks out
[1:53:58] <%mighty_max_t> Sam is NOT humble
[1:53:58] <peachy996> Good fucking thing Doomguy saved a copy of Vega in Doom2016
[1:54:00] <$Wafflum> It's FIIIINE
[1:54:01] <%Niney_Who> HE STOLE GOD and made him into a COMPUTER
[1:54:02] <%NovaKnightmare> VEGAS COOL THO
[1:54:02] <%Wallabri> "seemed like a good idea at the time"
[1:54:02] <mostundesired> What better AI than GOD?
[1:54:02] <+LandOfTheWay> Sam: "pretty much lol"
[1:54:03] <peachy996> Jesus
[1:54:03] <%jiin6> No
[1:54:04] <+MisterRockett> I mean what other practical applications did god have?
[1:54:05] <ringabal> DOOMGUY MADE A BACKUP FOR DATA GOD
[1:54:06] <%alcors_wisdom> so? doom slayer used him as a amazon echo
[1:54:07] <iosephe> It's not like it was doing anything else
[1:54:07] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt he tried to delete him too remember?
[1:54:07] <%hmgirlpopuri> They said in the first one Vega was built from something they found in Hell, so I mean maybe the demons stole him and then Sam stole him from them
[1:54:08] <%SkyPirateArcane> Seems like it would blow up in your face, but whatevs
[1:54:10] <+Javaa01> Yeah, he used a God to run the janitor bathroom cleaning scheduler
[1:54:10] <%tigerfang86> GOD AI is the best AI
[1:54:11] <tyrano_the_wise> WAT
[1:54:11] <Kurrisum> I'd say evil, yes
[1:54:13] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> HE ALSO SAID TO DELETE HIM
[1:54:15] <iosephe> Being stolen and all
[1:54:15] <heartlesshealer> "Hey kid! I'm a computer"
[1:54:16] <Tha_Mik> And he was going to kill vega in 2016
[1:54:18] <shotgang86> he REALLY wanted to run Crysis on ultra Pat
[1:54:18] <Josef_Stryker> FUCK HIM UP
[1:54:19] <%dekkitout> But Pat- imagine how many Google Chrome windows a god-mind can run?
[1:54:23] <+Pookiedaexzile> Sam...Sam.....Is that short for something...like SATAN
[1:54:24] <%dekkitout> Atleast..... 8!
[1:54:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> YE
[1:54:27] <%tigerfang86> BLAP
[1:54:27] <Onmi_Khaos> Listen man, he doesn't tell you how to shoot demons, now does he?
[1:54:29] <awalr> delet
[1:54:29] <SovPho> @PatStaresAt Make a computer based off of god. That AI is now thankful for its life, and loyal. Now make that AI god. Sound wasteful?
[1:54:32] <TheAmazingClaytor> NYOOM
[1:54:32] <RyanTheRecluse> Not actual God, just a logic machine God type.
[1:54:33] <SevenDeadlyCyns> archvile: handled
[1:54:35] <%DappercatEsquire> @patstaresat nah I'm gonna use MACHINE AI GOD in my smart Keurig fuck it
[1:54:35] <Onmi_Khaos> So get the fuck off his back
[1:54:36] <osiris1260> @cavumentum That’s a really good point
[1:54:37] <CappuccinoGuil> My theory is that Hayden died and Samur took over his identity in a big robot body
[1:54:39] <%SpicyVibration> God has a lot of processing threads
[1:54:49] <Mister_McDerp> VEGA is the Omnissiah
[1:54:53] <%bensonplayspokemon> Become as God-AI
[1:54:54] <dking0000> Vega said Samuel melded with the ship easily, meaning his body or brain is Maykr somehow
[1:54:56] <Yummy_Nukes> the Fuck Off stick
[1:54:58] <Josef_Stryker> How come Pat is moving so fast? Is that part of Ultra-Violence?
[1:54:58] <+Javaa01> God's a next gen Epyc server processor
[1:54:59] <Tha_Mik> How many cores does God have?
[1:55:00] <SovPho> @SpicyVibration Yeah he's like at least dual quad core.
[1:55:00] <%Louie_Salmon> @cappuccinoguil Yeyeye that's what I'm on for sure
[1:55:02] <%linkster291> God doesn't like to be Overclocked though.
[1:55:02] <mostundesired> I mean, honestly, if you could have GOD be your CPU, wouldn't you?
[1:55:11] <%GraceTBM> i always found the arbalest unimpressive against anything but cacodemons
[1:55:12] <peachy996> I believe Sam never existed and fabricated his entire human backstory
[1:55:13] <%InugamiTheHound> aren't these demon not evil but morally challenged?
[1:55:13] <osiris1260> They did say Sam’s body was “alien”
[1:55:13] <+Aeriqui> moving fast is just being good at DOOM
[1:55:13] <%Valdorick> So, S.Hayden (or SATAN) rebelled against "Khan Maykar" and Stole "The Father" to empower Doomguy with the power to kill everything?
[1:55:15] <ringabal> We have DEUS EX MACHINA as our GPS
[1:55:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> Samuel was probably banking on Doomguy backing up VEGA
[1:55:15] <gunzerkingdunce> Can God run Doom?
[1:55:21] <Saltmeisterr> i think samur and sam share the same body/mind
[1:55:22] <%GraceTBM> Pat is using a glory kill speed boost rune
[1:55:29] <%SpicyVibration> Do you know how expensive GPU's are these days Pat?
[1:55:29] <%mighty_max_t> Honsetly, I'm super curious as to what the story DLCs will be
[1:55:29] <Tha_Mik> Can God run Crysis?
[1:55:31] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> can god run crysis tho
[1:55:33] <Monkeyweed21> Yes Pat run at them with a rocket launcher
[1:55:38] <+Javaa01> Sam has a LOT of spreadsheets open at once, he needs those threads
[1:55:38] <peachy996> Remember the Kahn Makyr exiled the Seraphim who empowered the Doom Slayer
[1:55:39] <j0ustar> God doesn't throttle you PC speeds
[1:55:43] <+JackalKing> Samuel Hayden is Samur Makyr, the Seraphim that gave Doomguy his power up and stole The Father from the Makyrs, forcing them to rely on Argent Energy to survive.
[1:55:49] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[1:55:52] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[1:55:53] <RyanTheRecluse> I mean in 2016 doom there's a log that says VEGA needed absolute zero cooling because just running him caused temperatures multitudes hotter than the sun
[1:55:54] <mostundesired> God has so much RAM it's crazy.
[1:55:54] <%DappercatEsquire> oof
[1:55:55] <librettodude> @Valdorick It's probably closer to Archangel Samael, associated with destruction
[1:55:56] <%bensonplayspokemon> But does God support PCI Gen 4?
[1:55:57] <%Piemen99> words
[1:55:57] <%spiritofmojave> Can God write Crisis 3
[1:55:58] <PirateMike_> I keep fucking pressing R to try and reload
[1:55:58] <dking0000> I completely forgot there’s story DLC planed HOLY SHIT
[1:55:58] <Tha_Mik> Nice wirda
[1:56:01] <inz0mbiac> Can god cut thies stream?
[1:56:01] <Saltmeisterr> i think heard that the dlc would focus on the hell hierarchy
[1:56:01] <%valriot> Imagine sandbagging yourself
[1:56:02] <hntronium> Run Crysis on Ultra?
[1:56:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> God can, in fact, run DOOM
[1:56:04] <SuperChumps> @PatStaresAt you have the BEST words
[1:56:05] <Kurrisum> the best words
[1:56:06] <Monkeyweed21> Samuel REALLY needed a good SSD Pat
[1:56:06] <%Louie_Salmon> @peachy996 It would make sense to search for a high-ranking scientist who was gonna die soon and replace him, especially with a matching name
[1:56:06] <%alcors_wisdom> cant believe slayer made god run doom
[1:56:06] <%Valdorick> Could God Make a Crisis so powerful not even he could run it on his SSD?
[1:56:08] <$RealThiele> he runs it on fair
[1:56:09] <MasterTonberry23> People always ask if they can run Crysis, but did anyone ever actually play Crysis?
[1:56:09] <%miguelrod777> god cant run my old pc games
[1:56:10] <TheAmazingClaytor> Can you put a Threadripper on GOD?
[1:56:20] <King_Wolf_Rigger> God doesn't throttle the internet just because some dumb fuck is worried about corona
[1:56:20] <$RetroCop87> God can run DOOM mods
[1:56:22] <%WhereIsWill> God been running 4k rigs since the 1800s
[1:56:26] <gunzerkingdunce> How much hentai can Vega/God hold?
[1:56:28] <mobiusnightshade> Wise words from wise men write wise deeds in wise pen.
[1:56:29] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat The Angel Samuel in the Old testament has a special title which is the Satan translated as the accuser
[1:56:30] <Reise04> Is Skyrim ported to GOD?
[1:56:31] <bigdumbidiotguy> Ride To Hell is way better than this game
[1:56:35] <%tigerfang86> SPEEEEEEEEEED rooH
[1:56:35] <+Cavumentum> Okay but when's the Skyrim port to the God OS?
[1:56:35] <+Javaa01> Thankfully DOOM runs on God
[1:56:36] <%D00msDayDan> and to think, if doomguy didn't notice the backup button he would have just completely erased god
[1:56:36] <%linkster291> @PatStaresAt The UAC setup God to mine Bit Coin.
[1:56:37] <ScreamLord> Can I run OG Doom on God?
[1:56:39] <%dekkitout> I played all 3 Crisis' -except warheads, fuck that one-
[1:56:45] <Monkeyweed21> no you dont
[1:56:45] <%QuadraticGravity> Can I play Doom on God
[1:56:47] <dking0000> God has been showing everybody his WADs
[1:56:48] <zakti_prime> hey, Sam got his shit caved in between 2016 and now, so I think his plans aren't 100%
[1:56:50] <PirateMike_> Brag much?
[1:56:52] <%Louie_Salmon> I can't hold all these masteries!
[1:56:53] <Tha_Mik> No you need more mastery though
[1:56:55] <%tigerfang86> it's FINE
[1:56:55] <Manwad> too good at the videogame FeelsBadMan
[1:56:56] <%GraceTBM> crysis 2 was the one i had the most fun with
[1:56:56] <MasterTonberry23> Stick the extra tokens up your butt. I'm clever Kappa
[1:56:58] <%Pappajimbo> the apocalpse is just the blue screen of the universe
[1:57:02] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I'll show God my WAD
[1:57:02] <%alcors_wisdom> "too many" sounds a lot like "NOT ALL"
[1:57:06] <TheAmazingClaytor> Guys Im too good at the video game tho.
[1:57:07] <peachy996> That's normal
[1:57:08] <bigdumbidiotguy> Ape Escape has better graphics than this
[1:57:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> @jackalking I bet Samur knew his society was actually big fuck evil and was trying to orchestrate its downfall. They just proved him right when he yoinked the Father and gave Doomguy the power boost.
[1:57:12] <Tucker0603> @patstaresat can God run my modded to shit Skyrim?
[1:57:13] <$megamonmon123> just use em
[1:57:14] <+Javaa01> Yeah you get half the upgrades in skip tokens
[1:57:14] <+luketrapwalker> Where does Doom Guy keep his weapons???
[1:57:16] <%DappercatEsquire> i think Hayden constructed his big fuck robot body witb found Maykr tech containing the consciousness of Samur, that awoke and melded with Hayden
[1:57:16] <%mighty_max_t> You're too strong pat
[1:57:16] <Fenlig> Slide one into your butt to master the ass!
[1:57:16] <JonEWorldbeater> Man, it sure was great when FPS games were just about having lots of cool guns & seeing what they could do
[1:57:17] <dking0000> DLC will make the BFG and Crucible upgradable probably
[1:57:17] <$PaleBloodInk> Yeah, you get a lot more than you need in this game.
[1:57:20] <@commanderclaw> The Loneliest Number
[1:57:21] <%DappercatEsquire> or something
[1:57:23] <%valriot> Its mostly for Nightmare so you dont have to do gimmicky shit cos you cant
[1:57:24] <%linkster291> They dump a lot on your, a lot on you. They probably didn't expect you to grind them all up.
[1:57:24] <osiris1260> 7 in the game
[1:57:28] <ringabal> Hahah ONE
[1:57:29] <%marsantas> They wanted to be sure people who are less good could get by
[1:57:30] <%NovaKnightmare> @luketrapwalker in his ass duh
[1:57:33] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> why would sam help the earth resistance if it was his plans for demons to reach earth though?
[1:57:34] <$numerohoowan> Question for Pat/chat: Never played a DMC game in my life. Should I pick up 5 for funsies?
[1:57:36] <%bensonplayspokemon> How high can I overclock GOD?!
[1:57:38] <%dekkitout> Crysis 2 was a blast, till you reconsider the body snatching concept..
[1:57:41] <Mister_McDerp> is Sam gonna be the new Khan?
[1:57:41] <librettodude> it sounds like Sam knew what was up and dipped out of Maykr society so he could try to prevent the same shit in human society by being the leading developer of argent
[1:57:46] <bigdumbidiotguy> Super Mario 64 has better graphics than thid
[1:57:49] <MasterTonberry23> I heard Yakuza 7 is gonna paywall New Game +
[1:57:53] <indig0bird> I wouldn't mind a melee based Doom
[1:58:04] <%GraceTBM> @numerohoowan DMC5 was my first DMC and it's one of my favorite games ever it's totally worth it
[1:58:06] <%InugamiTheHound> oh man that mod makes the shotgun so damn cool
[1:58:06] <$megamonmon123> i think full auto and the microwave beam are my least favourite mods
[1:58:07] <TheAmazingClaytor> God needs an upgrade
[1:58:08] <indig0bird> Dashing and double jump already helps with that
[1:58:08] <%DappercatEsquire> @numerohoowan Yeah, it's a good time
[1:58:11] <Shwepie> @luketrapwalker In the hole in his heart where Daisy used to be.

[1:58:22] <%코코꾸라> It's a secret to everyone
[1:58:22] <bigdumbidiotguy> I heard Yakuza 7 will make you pay for the game before you can play it
[1:58:22] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> come one people it's not hard to put it together ID didn't make it complaicated
[1:58:24] <RyanTheRecluse> They don't need upgrades, all the other weapons are tools but the super weapons are solutions.
[1:58:24] <tigo0donnell> @numerohoowan Yes, it’s the most accessible to newcomers and is easy to get into now with its tutorials and void to practice
[1:58:26] <%neVan0> SHUT UP
[1:58:26] <mostundesired> No shut up, it was secret.
[1:58:27] <ringabal> Data for the Data God
[1:58:28] <awalr> it has a question mark on it that's very secret
[1:58:30] <DexteraXIII> Making sure you're paying attention.
[1:58:32] <%Pappajimbo> video games are hard
[1:58:32] <MasterTonberry23> Funnily enough I bet most people would miss it
[1:58:34] <$megamonmon123> some people dont look up pat

[2:01:09] <%Valdorick> Yeah wow, really is just eaiser to rifle shot the angles in the dick, huh?
[2:01:11] <%GraceTBM> blood punch+ auto shotty= dead anything
[2:01:12] <%dekkitout> Cause skulls are highly energy efficient- duh
[2:01:12] <dking0000> Wait a bit, Maykrs are just as fucked as demons
[2:01:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> PogChamp
[2:01:24] <MasterTonberry23> Boy its a good thing you discovered that powerful tactic just before your death
[2:01:25] <%Faustgesicht> Have we seen an Angel Glory Kill yet?
[2:01:32] <iosephe> yeah
[2:01:33] <Mister_McDerp> I love that headpop noise
[2:01:38] <iosephe> it doesn't provide much
[2:01:38] <+LandOfTheWay> @Faustgesicht yep
[2:01:41] <%GraceTBM> the angel glory kills are pretty basic, honeslty
[2:01:43] <osiris1260> @faustgesicht Yes, they’re kinda boring
[2:01:43] <a_timberdoodle> well, the Khan Maykr at least has been exposing herself to tons of Argent energy to extend her life, and we see what that did to the Daeg priests
[2:01:44] <TheAmazingClaytor> Yep, slice it in two the easy way
[2:01:50] <bigdumbidiotguy> I heard if you press XXXXXXXXX you turn on the aimbot
[2:01:51] <librettodude> really can't wait for those 2 DLCs, especially if they're going to be sidestories
[2:02:14] <%GraceTBM> i'm more ecxited for master levels of the early levels
[2:02:17] <mobiusnightshade> @bigdumbidiotguy The aimbot's into kinky shit, huh?
[2:02:24] <dking0000> Doomguy fighting with the Sentinels would be dope DLC
[2:02:35] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> DLC1 should be what the hell happened to Doomguy between 2016 and now
[2:02:37] <%DappercatEsquire> I think this game effectively lampshades "angels bad too lol" by portraying the Maykrs as just some advanced civilization that cribbed/spread common religious iconography.
[2:02:39] <+JackalKing> Doom Eternal needs mod support. I want to relive the days of custom WADs.
[2:02:41] <%GraceTBM> this fight is fucking tough
[2:02:42] <mostundesired> Man, this is fucked.
[2:02:44] <+AbnormalVoid> jesus can't save you now
[2:02:46] <%Valdorick> Welcome to the fuck box!
[2:02:48] <indig0bird> Sword!
[2:02:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> nailed it
[2:02:52] <+NitronStreams> Jeezus cant save you
[2:02:55] <PirateMike_> I hate them eyeballs
[2:02:56] <theoriginalbigboy3535> has pat streamed Animal Crossing since that first time?
[2:03:02] <bigdumbidiotguy> what if they made a game where Doomguy fought with his INNER DEMONS??
[2:03:05] <librettodude> idk if Eternal is modular enough to support a modding scene
[2:03:05] <TheAmazingClaytor> Caco's will fuck you up if they get close
[2:03:09] <JonEWorldbeater> It's weird how I still have an easier time following this than RE6
[2:03:11] <%Valdorick> He does 5 minutes of Animal Crossing every stream
[2:03:12] <%GraceTBM> pat has been sticking 5 min of animal crossing into the start of each stream
[2:03:13] <j0ustar> I spot a swordy
[2:03:24] <%Louie_Salmon> I feel like there was an entire game just as long as this between 2016 and Eternal
[2:03:24] <%spiritofmojave> not really besides his little check ins to his island before Dooms
[2:03:27] <+SH1NK1R0> Is that a rage power up up top?
[2:03:32] <%GraceTBM> it's almost like this game is designed to be visually clear and understandable at a glance, unlike RE6
[2:03:36] <osiris1260> I did my “you can’t improve perfection” run the other day and this area sucked. I was also doing the lives mode challenge at the same time like a dumbass
[2:03:43] <Centrilion> just blew off his shins
[2:03:44] <%dekkitout> In every DoomE stream, there's an Animal Crossing easter egg Kappa
[2:03:50] <%SpicyVibration> That's cause doom guy takes up less of the screen than the guys in RE6
[2:03:57] <%GraceTBM> what's a you can't improve perfecton run

[2:04:59] <%alcors_wisdom> @PirateMike_ naw closes hes done is new vegas
[2:04:59] <%SpicyVibration> It's God of War
[2:05:01] <Ultimatefool> @osiris1260 Wow fuck that, I'd just do that on easy
[2:05:04] <+AbnormalVoid> just don't get hit 4Head
[2:05:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat killed the palpatine of demons secretly while trying to kill the big demon. He really did the right thing after all
[2:05:10] <CrazyMedicine> Finally
[2:05:12] <%GraceTBM> @PirateMike_ he did K1 with woolz on SBFP
[2:05:16] <%spiritofmojave> @ahdurian ultra violenceA
[2:05:17] <RyanTheRecluse> ultraviolence
[2:05:17] <bigdumbidiotguy> has he gotten the Bologna Cannon yet?
[2:05:20] <%spiritofmojave> *!
[2:05:20] <%D00msDayDan> that one's just mean
[2:05:27] <%ahdurian> @spiritofmojave ty bb
[2:05:34] <%Louie_Salmon> "Noooo you can't just block all damage from 180 degrees, Doom is supposed to be about constant movement and enemy awareness!" "Haha chaingun go ratatat"
[2:05:39] <TheAmazingClaytor> The game made Pat kill the Bron like a MAN
[2:05:39] <%GraceTBM> is balogna cannon the unmakyr? if so then yes
[2:05:40] <%InugamiTheHound> when did pat get sick head shot skills?
[2:05:40] <shotgang86> psaCrazyhand
[2:05:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> Infite spawning enemies?
[2:05:45] <PirateMike_> @GraceTBM but that was woolie playing right?
[2:05:49] <$joylent_blue> he has played kotor 2, just hasn't played it on stream
[2:05:50] <%GraceTBM> yeah pirate
[2:05:53] <%spiritofmojave> @ahdurian yw! <3
[2:05:54] <osiris1260> @ultimatefool I did and it still sucked since to get the “lives mode” achievement you need to beat Icon with 10+ lives
[2:05:54] <a_timberdoodle> Maykr heads are to Doom Eternal what The Possessed were to Doom 2016
[2:05:59] <awalr> hot take: doom eternal is a video game of quite high quality
[2:06:06] <bigdumbidiotguy> I've never even seen a video game before
[2:06:08] <Onmi_Khaos> Once you realize the chain gun stunlocks charger enemies they become jokes
[2:06:11] <j0ustar> It's almost like Pat is a snapshotking
[2:06:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Louie_Salmon Your chaingun goes rat tat tat MINE goes BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[2:06:16] <SomeAsianDood> Controversial af awalr
[2:06:17] <$megamonmon123> man the super shotgun is the best in this game
[2:06:20] <ape_hawk> yeah, we can kinda see that
[2:06:23] <%GraceTBM> fuck this jump
[2:06:23] <mostundesired> Shit's fucked, man.
[2:06:25] <JoshyJ> based
[2:06:26] <%StaceMcGate> ...How does Sam know all of this?
[2:06:26] <Mister_McDerp> GOOD
[2:06:26] <ringabal> "I was holding them BACK"
[2:06:26] <Coffee_JD> nice
[2:06:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> DOOM...ETERNAL
[2:06:29] <ape_hawk> no, pretty sure she did that
[2:06:29] <MasterTonberry23> @awalr Whoa controversial opinion there, you might get people mad
[2:06:31] <TheAmazingClaytor> This jump sucks butt
[2:06:32] <PirateMike_> This game runs smooth as balls
[2:06:32] <nobody12349> Get fucked Maykr
[2:06:35] <ataxia72> eternal doomnation
[2:06:35] <Mister_McDerp> YEAH ITS HER FAULT
[2:06:37] <%GraceTBM> he finally doesn't blame you completely
[2:06:39] <%SpicyVibration> what a dumb bitch
[2:06:45] <tyrano_the_wise> GOOD
[2:06:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> Not that Samuel would know anything of hubris
[2:06:48] <a_timberdoodle> YOU'RE ONE TO TALK ABOUT HUBRIS, SAMMY
[2:06:49] <%Valdorick> You could say its... Paradise Lost?
[2:06:49] <mostundesired> No shut up.
[2:06:49] <%marsantas> He sounds so smug about it too
[2:06:54] <bigdumbidiotguy> they should have a game with a baby doom called WOMB
[2:06:58] <peachy996> She's not all-knowing.
[2:06:58] <%GraceTBM> nope, she was shocked that you would be so ostentatious
[2:07:04] <+AzureGale> Fuck and hit it
[2:07:05] <+Cavumentum> To be fair nothing was gonna stop you, honestly
[2:07:06] <%tusk102> wow
[2:07:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> F
[2:07:08] <%GraceTBM> this jump sucks
[2:07:09] <+AbnormalVoid> I bet she didn't expect you to have the fuck-you syringe
[2:07:09] <%Louie_Salmon> She wasn't in her fighting clothes, you surprised her
[2:07:11] <Mister_McDerp> Sam likes that someone else fucked up this time
[2:07:11] <osiris1260> The heart is usually indestructible
[2:07:14] <peachy996> Didn't know you had the Crucible and you took the Betrayer's Weapon
[2:07:17] <ape_hawk> so, pat, theres an easy way to do this
[2:07:19] <+Javaa01> Only your LONGEST jump may suffice
[2:07:20] <+SH1NK1R0> What would have been able to do that all these demons couldnt?
[2:07:21] <%alcors_wisdom> these bitches dont know how to fight its why the get other races to do it for them
[2:07:25] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt don't forget that sam tried to delete god but doomguy decided against it
[2:07:27] <%StaceMcGate> DOOM: The most HARDCORE platforming on the planet
[2:07:27] <Coffee_JD> just do it good
[2:07:29] <JonEWorldbeater> So, quick guess: Samuel's name is actually Samael.
[2:07:31] <bigdumbidiotguy> the easy way is to not fucking suck dick
[2:07:31] <JoshyJ> you just gotta do it good
[2:07:34] <%DappercatEsquire> this jump took me like 10 fucking tries
[2:07:35] <sakeydo> missed it by that much. lol
[2:07:36] <Monkeyweed21> The heart is indestructible except to the dad's knife
[2:07:37] <Odetokale> thats the right way
[2:07:38] <peachy996> This music
[2:07:39] <%Louie_Salmon> Btw you can angle up for more height
[2:07:40] <ringabal> JUMP SELLER! I require your LONGEST JUMPS
[2:07:41] <Captain_Aham> this one kinda sucks
[2:07:41] <RyanTheRecluse> 2016
[2:07:42] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> yeah
[2:07:42] <%Maids4lyfe> YOU HAD TO BLOW UP VEGA
[2:07:43] <Mister_McDerp> yeah
[2:07:43] <ape_hawk> yeah
[2:07:43] <JoshyJ> doom guy backed it up in 2016
[2:07:43] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> in 2016
[2:07:43] <+Cavumentum> "You have to destroy Vega"
[2:07:44] <dking0000> Why does Samuel care about Urdak at all? It’s almost like he’s related to that Seraphim Samur guy who fucked of because of hell dealings.
[2:07:44] <%Pyroclase> blowing him up, remember?
[2:07:44] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeah
[2:07:45] <Jolly_Adventurer> In 2016 DOOm
[2:07:46] <+LandOfTheWay> yeah, in 2016
[2:07:46] <librettodude> He told you to
[2:07:46] <TheAmazingClaytor> yeah
[2:07:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> When Vega had to delf destruct
[2:07:47] <+theman515> that was a whole mission in 2016
[2:07:48] <%DRAGKUDO> No
[2:07:48] <%neVan0> YEAH
[2:07:48] <+maenos2> even if it's normally indestructible why chance it with the fucking doom guy
[2:07:48] <%MalekDracarus> yeah
[2:07:48] <shotgang86> 2016
[2:07:49] <Tucker0603> remember 2016
[2:07:51] <%spiritofmojave> back in 2016
[2:07:51] <a_timberdoodle> Sam was just going to have you blow him up
[2:07:52] <iosephe> yeah
[2:07:52] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt YEAH he super did. doomguy decided to keep the core
[2:07:53] <%alcors_wisdom> yeh
[2:07:54] <peachy996> "I have regrets"
[2:07:54] <indig0bird> Yeah,you technically only have a copy
[2:07:55] <Them00n> Pat forgot all of 2016
[2:07:58] <%linkster291> You had to blow up Vega's Core.
[2:08:01] <bigdumbidiotguy> sam tried to throw a milkshake at me at the McDonalds drive through
[2:08:02] <Josef_Stryker> Man this jump is a bitch
[2:08:03] <%trustycoyote> yup
[2:08:03] <+Pookiedaexzile> The fist game
[2:08:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> He probably expected you to do the backup
[2:08:06] <ringabal> "I have many regrets, Dr Hayden."
[2:08:09] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> nice
[2:08:09] <+SH1NK1R0> Yeah used him as a bomb to blow open hell
[2:08:09] <Darkrenai> He copied that floppy
[2:08:10] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> eh, he didnt say that specifically, he said Vega had "served his purpose"
[2:08:10] <JoshyJ> god fits on a 16gb usb bro
[2:08:13] <%WhereIsWill> crushed it
[2:08:14] <Josef_Stryker> Aaaaand Pat did it first try
[2:08:14] <%Valdorick> That PETABYTES sized USB
[2:08:14] <PirateMike_> sick jump
[2:08:15] <RantingRavager> Ergo: DOOM GUY SAVES GOD
[2:08:18] <shotgang86> I got God on my 16gb pen drive
[2:08:18] <%SpicyVibration> usb-2 even
[2:08:19] <Mister_McDerp> was it?
[2:08:23] <%Maids4lyfe> was it?
[2:08:27] <peachy996> I don't think Sam cares about his race anymore
[2:08:32] <%spiritofmojave> God is one Sandisk 8gb usb stick
[2:08:33] <%Maids4lyfe> Sam probably expected you to
[2:08:33] <ape_hawk> i mean, it just furthers the whole "sam is satan" thing
[2:08:33] <%D00msDayDan> well, what's god done for us?
[2:08:34] <RyanTheRecluse> God.exe must be a very compressed program
[2:08:35] <%mighty_max_t> Unless Sam is trying to BE the new God?
[2:08:38] <bigdumbidiotguy> one time i saw a frog swallow a USB
[2:08:39] <%GraceTBM> VEGA must be runnin at lik 5% capacity to not burn out the doom base
[2:08:43] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Googol-bytes sized usb
[2:08:43] <%valriot> BACK UP YOUR GOD IN STADIA
[2:08:43] <not_twitter_rowan> Sam probably expected you too
[2:08:44] <mobiusnightshade> Doomguy wasn;t the Seraphim... VEGA WAS.
[2:08:45] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Sam? Shortsighted? Nah.
[2:08:45] <PirateMike_> Who knew doom had a plot
[2:08:46] <%alcors_wisdom> well i mean hayden thought he had it under control in 2016
[2:08:47] <%GraceTBM> sam is penis
[2:08:48] <%Agami23> doomguy does everything sam says not to do.
[2:08:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> Remember, he knows more a out Doomguy than we thought. He was probably betting on it.
[2:08:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> what are you talking about?
[2:08:51] <%bevyrage> don't forget that sam TOOK YOUR SWORD
[2:08:51] <SevenDeadlyCyns> What? Sam? Untrustworthy? Never.
[2:08:52] <Mister_McDerp> Sam is probably Lucifer
[2:08:52] <Jolly_Adventurer> Sam feels slimy
[2:08:52] <azacca_bitter> "seems"
[2:08:52] <Tha_Mik> Sam is dumb
[2:08:52] <indig0bird> I mean, without the religious implications the Father is just a really smart IA
[2:08:53] <CrazyMedicine> "You can copy GOD with my 2GB Pendrive"
[2:08:53] <%DRAGKUDO> I mean his name is Satan
[2:08:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Is Vega the father or is vega an AI that thinks he is the father?
[2:08:55] <a_timberdoodle> Samur was the Seraphim
[2:08:55] <%spiritofmojave> sam is a butt
[2:08:57] <mostundesired> Now why would you say that about loveable ol Sam?
[2:08:59] <%DappercatEsquire> that's why i think something had to have happened in the two years between 2016 and Eternal
[2:09:00] <JonEWorldbeater> Or was it all according to keikaku?
[2:09:00] <%GraceTBM> sam thought he had it under control cause he could pull odomguy out
[2:09:04] <RunningNGunning> God compresses very well in zip format
[2:09:04] <Tha_Mik> Sam is just dumb
[2:09:04] <+Cavumentum> "I am not the villain in this story," says Sam Hayden, thinking about the Khan Maykr probably
[2:09:05] <osiris1260> Makyr society is such a way that a coup is literally not possible
[2:09:07] <$jacob2pop> Sam seems like a giant asshole
[2:09:08] <+JackalKing> Samuel is Samur Makyr, the Seraphim.
[2:09:09] <+Neoepochx> !uptime
[2:09:10] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 9m.
[2:09:11] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt the connection between samuel and samur is unclear, cause samuel has a backstory as a human
[2:09:13] <TheAmazingClaytor> Doctor Samuel Hayden, 6 letters in each word, 666.
[2:09:14] <Odetokale> sam's not satan, he's just southern\
[2:09:15] <librettodude> Sam probably knew that Doomguy never actively kills/destroys living things other than Demons
[2:09:16] <awalr> i love how the hellrazer replacement zombies waddle around
[2:09:19] <%mighty_max_t> I mean, he did become a Savior when he brought the Crucible to earth as it was being invaded
[2:09:20] <Cobaltor_252> How does Hayden know so much about Doomguy and Makyr shit?!?
[2:09:21] <nazzynoeyes> Don't get why they don't just upload VEGA to the cloud and stream him Kappa
[2:09:21] <%Louie_Salmon> @gracetbm I assume it's like Glados, it just uses what's available and that's how advanced it will behave
[2:09:27] <%ahdurian> @Odetokale same thing though
[2:09:31] <%Valdorick> Backstories can be made up and edited though.
[2:09:32] <gazingeye1> What has god ever done for us?........recently
[2:09:32] <%mighty_max_t> He was just a bad savior and failed
[2:09:33] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> go outside, hook a hard left
[2:09:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> What if Sam was being controled by Kahn last game
[2:09:34] <%Niney_Who> LUL
[2:09:35] <%spiritofmojave> @odetokale THE DEVIL
[2:09:35] <bigdumbidiotguy> Sam doesn't have a membership to Sam's Club. he goes to the door and says, "but my name is Sam, har har har har"
[2:09:35] <%GraceTBM> that sounds reasonable louie
[2:09:38] <Odetokale> as a southerner, true
[2:09:41] <Mister_McDerp> Khan Maykr is bad, Sam is bad, VEGA is a precious cinnamon roll
[2:09:42] <%neVan0> LUL
[2:09:43] <+hashmalknight> What is this Metroid Prime?
[2:09:44] <mostundesired> SICK
[2:09:44] <%dekkitout> Indeed
[2:09:50] <Jolly_Adventurer> Sam wears his shoes to bed
[2:09:50] <ringabal> Shiny Pokemon
[2:09:53] <a_timberdoodle> and Samuel doesn't really talk like he appreciates or understands VEGA's real potential if VEGA is in fact The Father/a piece of The Father
[2:09:56] <%alcors_wisdom> smell jerk is NOT what you think it is
[2:09:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> got the stink lines and everything
[2:09:58] <%GraceTBM> we shoulda put vega in sam's body
[2:09:59] <dking0000> It’s possible that the only connection is that Samuels body is Maykr, meaning it could just be made out of Samur’s shit
[2:10:09] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt did you see that it fuckin said "playset sold separately" on the left
[2:10:10] <bigdumbidiotguy> VEGA is just SEGA
[2:10:13] <peachy996> Aw yeah this room
[2:10:18] <+Cavumentum> @alcors_wisdom is it the opposite of chokejerk
[2:10:23] <%tusk102> lmao
[2:10:26] <osiris1260> Same body is Makyr tech is kind of important
[2:10:27] <+Neoepochx> @PatStaresAt What do you think of the Urdak atmospher?
[2:10:27] <residentfunko> when everyone realizes the doom dolls for all the enemies are indeed FUNKO POPS! the POWER!!
[2:10:28] <$megamonmon123> vega is the best bro
[2:10:29] <%GraceTBM> i can't wait to buy all the toys in real life!!!
[2:10:32] <TheAmazingClaytor> Vega does what Nintendon't.
[2:10:36] <librettodude> I wonder what the symbolism behind the name 'VEGA' is, if that's the case
[2:10:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dking0000 Does that mean that Sam was part of the Makyr hivemind?
[2:10:43] <%tusk102> i assume it means you'll find the playset? @PatStaresAt
[2:10:46] <$megamonmon123> i think vega is the only friend doomguy has....
[2:10:48] <%Niney_Who> Just to rip and tear
[2:10:49] <%Valdorick> Just DO
[2:10:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 I'm totally giving Samur the benefit of the doubt. This is all a Xanatos Gambit to prevent the Makyr from being a universe-conquering empire fueled by souls.
[2:10:52] <duckmeister7> now this looks like shadow warrior 2
[2:10:53] <mostundesired> Just to do.
[2:10:53] <%dekkitout> Good
[2:10:55] <%bevyrage> yeah just have a good ol' romp around
[2:10:55] <JonEWorldbeater> Sam Hayden, known Poopy Buttfart Stinkbum
[2:10:55] <%GingaNZ> GingaNZ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Yo pat, finished doom eternal a couple days ago and I gotta say its my favorite FPS. I love this mix of character action speed with doom. Anyway cheers for the entertainment from quarantine in New Zealand.
[2:10:56] <%GraceTBM> it's combat chess, sometimes you need that taste
[2:10:56] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> Like RE4?
[2:10:57] <ataxia72> yeah absolutely
[2:10:58] <%SoFarFetched> Just to do-om
[2:10:58] <bigdumbidiotguy> every time I beat a game I delete it or throw it in the trash
[2:11:00] <+NitronStreams> just to doom
[2:11:01] <%valriot> Its a fun "shoot game feel good" game
[2:11:03] <%Rumbutt> Because kill demon is fun
[2:11:04] <%AnIcedCoffee> There is the master levels that are really fun
[2:11:05] <%Meltdown547> It feels so good to just do things in Eternal.
[2:11:05] <+Javaa01> You should really play Nightmare though, it's great
[2:11:05] <mostundesired> Nice.
[2:11:06] <Saltmeisterr> theres master levels too
[2:11:10] <mobiusnightshade> Just for dickin' around.
[2:11:10] <%DappercatEsquire> @dking0000 i'm thinking whatever alien tech Sam used for his robot body had Samur's consciousness
[2:11:11] <a_timberdoodle> BUFF TOTEMS ARE THE ACTUAL WORST
[2:11:11] <PirateMike_> Seems like a one and done type game to me
[2:11:12] <KSDM> Pretty sure it's an allegory for the holy trinity.
[2:11:12] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> I'm replaying on the extra life mode right now
[2:11:13] <%Louie_Salmon> @residentfunko Much more like nendroids, since they all have different bodies at least
[2:11:17] <%GraceTBM> it's a game designed for mastery
[2:11:18] <+Pookiedaexzile> Whens the Netflix show where they give Doom guy a orphan to tote around
[2:11:18] <+SH1NK1R0> Also dlc on release mayhaps?
[2:11:20] <%valriot> KILL THE FUCK POLE
[2:11:24] <Sol_Install> or get good
[2:11:27] <ataxia72> how do you unlock those master levels? I finished the game on UV and none showed up
[2:11:28] <MasterTonberry23> Pat how dare you play a video game and not let us watch
[2:11:29] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> yo this one is ruff, dont fall off or youll be dropped off right in the middle of the baddies
[2:11:29] <%GraceTBM> the blood totems teach you to move fast and avoid getting hit when you need to
[2:11:29] <bigdumbidiotguy> damn, Redman got a cameo in this game?
[2:11:30] <%bensonplayspokemon> Angry Shootman: the game
[2:11:33] <%alcors_wisdom> @Cavumentum no its when you jerk it while sniffing the other person typically female top 5 places to be sniffing is armpits, ass, specifically farts, hair and at #1 feet
[2:11:39] <dking0000> @doc_ock_rokc most likely not, just going on Theroy, Sam didn’t go Samur until being plugged into the Fortress and connecting with Vega again
[2:11:46] <the38bandit> first run, get all collectibles. Second , hardest difficulties
[2:11:50] <peachy996> Yeah get cozy with tthat Rocket Launcher lock on
[2:11:52] <mostundesired> It's a lotta dudes.
[2:11:55] <%Niney_Who> TYRANT
[2:11:56] <%Louie_Salmon> @ataxia72 There's 4 panels in front of the mission portal, one of them is master levels
[2:12:04] <Ultimatefool> If only you had a gun that could kill all the enemies at once
[2:12:05] <LittleBigQuebec> is that a quad damage up there
[2:12:09] <bigdumbidiotguy> these are the same demons from the movie Little Nicky?
[2:12:15] <ataxia72> yeah but when I checked it after beating the game it didnt list anything
[2:12:15] <%GraceTBM> the existing master levels are super fun
[2:12:21] <$vincerocmm> pop
[2:12:21] <%alcors_wisdom> @mostundesired thats what SHE said ha HA
[2:12:27] <cascadepersona> Wait, is Doomguy literally just some guy?
[2:12:28] <mostundesired> Damn
[2:12:29] <%GraceTBM> one of the current master levels was pre order
[2:12:32] <%dekkitout> @Cavumentum Can confirm, that is exactly what smell jerk iss
[2:12:33] <%tusk102> why doesn't he use the power up?
[2:12:33] <awalr> feels like the buff totems were originally archvile encounters in development but then they buffed the hell out of the archvile and made them rarer or some shit
[2:12:34] <+Neoepochx> @LittleBigQuebec It is a Megasphere
[2:12:40] <%mighty_max_t> Blorb = Full Health/Armor
[2:12:43] <%SpicyVibration> He's the One Guy
[2:12:43] <%D00msDayDan> @cascadepersona he was just some guy, then he got juiced with makyr bullshit
[2:12:47] <librettodude> @cascadepersona he WAS just some guy, but god saw how rad as fuck he was
[2:12:47] <transporterthesequel> Doomguy is RIP AND TEAR guy yes
[2:12:48] <+Who_lio42> @PatStaresAt u can pop the drones with the sticky bomb
[2:12:55] <%Louie_Salmon> @ataxia72 Very weird, there should be one unlocked by default and one you unlock halfway through the campaign
[2:12:58] <dking0000> @cascadepersona ye, the random nobody from OG doom
[2:13:00] <bigdumbidiotguy> Doomguy is a tax prep agent
[2:13:03] <%GraceTBM> oomguy was also trained by the sentinels
[2:13:03] <+Cavumentum> @alcors_wisdom @dekkitout I mean then I guess it still is the opposite, because it relies on an act based on breathing
[2:13:04] <mostundesired> Doom Guy is Cyber-Guts
[2:13:05] <+Pookiedaexzile> Doom guy is some guy, plus experience, and some Hevean roids
[2:13:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> @cascadepersona Yeah, tho he did get juiced with big power as part of some machinations
[2:13:15] <%GraceTBM> louie one of the current master levels was pre order
[2:13:18] <%alcors_wisdom> @Cavumentum u rite i was just thinking that
[2:13:22] <cascadepersona> @d00msdaydan @librettodude @dking0000 I see, Doomguy is raw.
[2:13:35] <bigdumbidiotguy> What if doomguy was one of us? just a stranger on a bus.
[2:13:45] <mobiusnightshade> Wait... If Doomguy is Cyber-Guts, does that mean the next evolution of the meme is 'Samuel did nothing wrong?'
[2:13:47] <shotgang86> how long until pat realize its 2 Tyrants?
[2:13:48] <peachy996> Love that Cannon noise
[2:13:48] <osiris1260> WWDGD
[2:13:51] <%Louie_Salmon> I wouldn't sit next to him
[2:13:53] <librettodude> there's a little bit of doomguy in all of us :)
[2:13:57] <Magicferret> Delicious
[2:14:00] <%alcors_wisdom> the saying is rip and tear you either rip or you tear
[2:14:02] <dking0000> I’d be pissed if Hell killed my Rabbit ngl
[2:14:03] <%Valdorick> Yeyeyeyeye
[2:14:04] <TheAmazingClaytor> REKT
[2:14:05] <ringabal> BLOOD PUNCH SELLER! I require your BLOODIEST PUNCHES!
[2:14:11] <$jacob2pop> @mobiusnightshade Betrayer did nothing wrong
[2:14:12] <%Niney_Who> IT'S TIME
[2:14:13] <bigdumbidiotguy> Doomguy likes his c
[2:14:14] <%mighty_max_t> Doomguy is the Punisher but a true hero
[2:14:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> I wish I could get into that argument again with the dude who thought Dante would beat Doomguy
[2:14:16] <%bensonplayspokemon> Blood Punch Man
[2:14:16] <%spiritofmojave> Doomguy ripped and tore for your sins!
[2:14:19] <+thefatfriend> possibly my favorite thing about this game handling is story is confirming that the comic is canon and that its the same guy
[2:14:20] <%tusk102> @ringabal thats a work of genius
[2:14:21] <+Javaa01> Blood Punching him while frozen would have done a lot more damage though
[2:14:25] <bigdumbidiotguy> Doomguy likes his Kool Aid without Sugar
[2:14:27] <cascadepersona> One day, Doomguy woke up to justice.
[2:14:30] <%GraceTBM> if demons killed my little dog i would absolutely spend literally my entire life killing them all
[2:14:32] <Mister_McDerp> everything is canon now
[2:14:32] <%SpicyVibration> When we getting doom guy for Smash?
[2:14:39] <Saltmeisterr> dante and doomguy wouldn't fight
[2:14:40] <%jiin6> doomguy is basically john wick vs demons
[2:14:43] <$megamonmon123> man the final boss is gonna be fun for him
[2:14:43] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt "Sam it's 4 pm, time for your head flattening"
[2:14:49] <%technofairyfolclor> technofairyfolclor subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 15 month streak! RIP AND TEAR!
[2:14:51] <+Pookiedaexzile> Doomguy is Sparda
[2:14:53] <+Javaa01> I think they're just stuck, don't worry about em
[2:14:59] <dking0000> More like Jesus zapped justice into Doomguy
[2:15:01] <mostundesired> Sick.
[2:15:04] <%GraceTBM> it's just... right there
[2:15:04] <librettodude> there are four levels of doomguy anger: Standard, All-Caps, All-Caps Bold, and All-Caps Bold Italicized
[2:15:07] <shotgang86> that's actally Peach Saliva calling you
[2:15:10] <$megamonmon123> it was penis flattening, why do you think hes just a torso? @tusk102
[2:15:12] <%Louie_Salmon> Many spare suit points
[2:15:12] <bigdumbidiotguy> Doomguy is a gorgatron
[2:15:13] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> @thefatfriend the comic isn't canon they just took the line
[2:15:15] <%tusk102> @dking0000 he drank jesus juice from isaac
[2:15:18] <%GraceTBM> doomguy isn't about justice, he's about retributio
[2:15:19] <peachy996> Looking forward to the pool
[2:15:20] <+Neoepochx> @PatStaresAt You gonna get some art with you in a praetor suit?

[2:15:28] <%tusk102> @megamonmon123 i was implying we'd stomp his head in but you're right
[2:15:32] <+Pookiedaexzile> it makes perfect sense

[2:16:19] <ringabal> BERSERKEEEER
[2:16:20] <+LandOfTheWay> less than you'd think, but more than you'd hope
[2:16:20] <@commanderclaw> Read his lore
[2:16:21] <+Neoepochx> There is a lore page that tells you how hard he can fuck it up.
[2:16:21] <%GraceTBM> he's also essentially immortal to everything but the crucible
[2:16:21] <%SpicyVibration> Return to Urf Realm
[2:16:21] <%Maids4lyfe> IT FUCKING EATS PLANTETS
[2:16:21] <%Agami23> didnt the icon of sin in doom 2 constantly spawn demons around it?
[2:16:22] <%linkster291> Reality breaks by his presence as hell portals open up around him.
[2:16:23] <King_Wolf_Rigger> erf lost its mechs tho
[2:16:23] <%Aleate> He's not even really that big
[2:16:24] <davimotion96> FUCK YOU MIURA
[2:16:25] <Monkeyweed21> A LOT PAT
[2:16:25] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> It destroys the fucking universe
[2:16:26] <bigdumbidiotguy> this game is for poobabbies
[2:16:26] <+RedKazoo> just a bit
[2:16:27] <ScreamLord> Crazy Talk
[2:16:27] <@commanderclaw> And you'll find out why
[2:16:27] <Ultimatefool> GRIFFITH
[2:16:27] <osiris1260> AN ABSOLUTE SHIT TON
[2:16:27] <%Deadpal> Yeah read hte lore.
[2:16:28] <%bensonplayspokemon> “How much damage?” “Yes.”
[2:16:28] <%walternatorz> about as much damage as you've done to this place in that period of time
[2:16:28] <Yummy_Nukes> HIS MERE PRESENCE WILL DESTROY THE UNIVERSE
[2:16:30] <%Deadpal> you have it already!
[2:16:30] <+Pookiedaexzile> You don't know him very welll do he
[2:16:31] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> it drags it to hell
[2:16:31] <Manwad> he's not even radioactive, fuck 'em
[2:16:32] <$jacob2pop> How iconic is the sin?
[2:16:32] <Byronic_dreamer> A LOT
[2:16:32] <Fenlig> What if he produces strong fart gass
[2:16:34] <%OkamiDude15> @patstaresat the icon EXISTING is collapsing the universe in on itself
[2:16:34] <dking0000> Just wait till that Last lore page, it’s fucking ridiculous
[2:16:40] <%SkyPirateArcane> There's 2 lore entries for him
[2:16:41] <%Deadpal> it's under story of hell.
[2:16:42] <MasterTonberry23> Considering how bad earth is fucked already he doesnt have to do much
[2:16:44] <%Meltdown547> Pat. You're playing Doom Slayer. Size means nothing in regards to damage.
[2:16:47] <%alcors_wisdom> well yeah pat but remember that right now only 31% of earth is alive
[2:16:50] <awalr> let's just let the icon of sin run rampant until we get herd immunity
[2:16:53] <bigdumbidiotguy> what the hell is a dmeon
[2:16:58] <ape_hawk> he warps reality with his monster dong
[2:17:00] <%Pyroclase> there's one left
[2:17:02] <peachy996> To say Icon of Sin does damage would be an understatement
[2:17:02] <+GeneralHysterics> icon of sin is a pretty dank name
[2:17:02] <%Pyroclase> in the final level
[2:17:03] <awalr> what's the worst that can happen
[2:17:04] <%SkyPirateArcane> You'll get another
[2:17:06] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> different lore in last level
[2:17:08] <%DappercatEsquire> @patstaresat well you have to consider, if he's really huge, he had really huge guts, therefore, big erf damage
[2:17:17] <$megamonmon123> Huge GUTS
[2:17:22] <+Javaa01> There's one last page in the final level that details what the Icon can do
[2:17:22] <peachy996> Okay good you didn't miss the pool
[2:17:22] <%tusk102> huge GUTS
[2:17:25] <%Maids4lyfe> The Icon of Sin is causing the universe to collapse into an ultra black hole just by existing
[2:17:25] <%OkamiDude15> It’s in the next level then
[2:17:26] <%Literal___Nobody> HUGE GUTS
[2:17:27] <%bensonplayspokemon> psaBig GUTSO
[2:17:30] <bigdumbidiotguy> if you fuck a wormhole do you just see a dick out of the other portal
[2:17:30] <mostundesired> RIP AND, I can't stress this enough, TEAR
[2:17:30] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> guts HUGE guts
[2:17:35] <CrazyMedicine> Icon of SIN? Big deal
[2:17:37] <%GraceTBM> that was some scrub shit
[2:17:40] <TheAmazingClaytor> When are we gonna get to the HUGE GUTS factory????
[2:17:44] <+Delenay> More guts to Rip and Tear out!
[2:17:48] <+VHGS> just the biggest nickelodeon guts of all time
[2:17:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> nice
[2:17:55] <Ultimatefool> Love how the aliens are just loot fountains
[2:18:03] <%DappercatEsquire> oh yeah and he will drag the entire universe into hell left unchecked but whatever
[2:18:06] <peachy996> Indeed
[2:18:09] <mostundesired> HMMM
[2:18:11] <+Javaa01> The only good thing Doom 3 gave to us
[2:18:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> hmmmmm
[2:18:13] <%Louie_Salmon> For being heaven, there's a lot of fuckin' demons here
[2:18:13] <%Maids4lyfe> THAT'S HEAVEN PAT
[2:18:14] <%SkyPirateArcane> Sinister
[2:18:15] <DexteraXIII> Huh
[2:18:15] <%Pyroclase> human souls being drained for power I guess?
[2:18:15] <ape_hawk> its FIIIIIIINE
[2:18:16] <%GraceTBM> doom 3 also inspired the phobos base's music in this
[2:18:16] <boomstickery> concerning
[2:18:16] <%Literal___Nobody> hmmmm
[2:18:18] <%D00msDayDan> those are probably argentans that got hit with the divinity machine

[2:30:07] <CappuccinoGuil> @MasterTonberry23 that's not even the start of it LUL
[2:30:09] <%bevyrage> oh man this hits SO GOOD
[2:30:09] <hntronium> That line is great
[2:30:09] <mostundesired> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:30:11] <%Louie_Salmon> A lot of strong quotes from "UAC hype lady"
[2:30:12] <Yummy_Nukes> i love this song
[2:30:15] <%Roundelay11> the fights in this level are actually pretty long
[2:30:17] <%neVan0> OH BOY
[2:30:19] <hntronium> THAT WHICH DOES NOT KILL US... IS WEAK
[2:30:21] <+RedKazoo> Yo this is Sick
[2:30:23] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> A party that never ends, with a host who never dieeeeeeees!!!!!!!!
[2:30:24] <deadweightman> the real sin is the friend we made along the way, Samuel Hayden
[2:30:24] <ScreamLord> Ok that last line was pretty good. "That which does not kill is, is weak."
[2:30:26] <Monkeyweed21> Killing the Archangel wasnt cool enough now kill Beelzbub
[2:30:31] <mobiusnightshade> @Louie_Salmon UAC Screamlord.
[2:30:32] <Saltmeisterr> this song goes IN
[2:30:39] <%tusk102> @thefatfriend yeah it literally is like "the khan makyr is basically just weaker god behind the ACTUAL god, the father" and then when you plug vega in he says he's the father and his memories are returning
[2:30:41] <+luketrapwalker> This music is fucking my eardrums
[2:30:48] <%kujofire990> yooo song name bros?
[2:30:50] <bigdumbidiotguy> I killed a demon yesterday that was trying to eat my carrots
[2:30:54] <%Louie_Salmon> @luketrapwalker That's how you know it's good
[2:30:56] <dking0000> Does Pat have the Kill Buff upgrade for the MM yet?
[2:30:57] <%StaceMcGate> DOOM is now SMT, killing both God and Satan
[2:31:00] <peachy996> Lemmy IS GOD soon
[2:31:07] <%Deadpal> wait
[2:31:07] <+luketrapwalker> @Louie_Salmon RIGHT?
[2:31:08] <Saltmeisterr> songs don't have names yet
[2:31:10] <%necrocannibal2> this game is so much faster than 2016 Kreygasm
[2:31:10] <+Neoepochx> @StaceMcGate Hell Yes.
[2:31:12] <%Deadpal> so this *entire game franchise*
[2:31:16] <FrankysDream> @PatStaresAt what are the challenges for this one?
[2:31:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> VIDEO GAMES
[2:31:20] <Saltmeisterr> just search for 'hell on earth'
[2:31:21] <%bensonplayspokemon> The music in this game is the shit, perfect fit
[2:31:22] <+thefatfriend> @tusk102 hot diggidy damn
[2:31:27] <%Deadpal> was set in motion by someone who just wanted to kill hell?
[2:31:27] <%GraceTBM> any encroaching monster that wants to kill humans gets to die regarless of holiness
[2:31:29] <ringabal> WE NETURAL ROUTE NOW BOIS
[2:31:32] <mostundesired> Someone find the name of this song on the OST STAT
[2:31:33] <%Deadpal> is that really haydens point?
[2:31:37] <%OkamiDude15> someone has ripped the ost so you can find it all on youtube
[2:31:37] <ape_hawk> who cares about the challenges for this one?
[2:31:43] <+RedKazoo> now THIS is fucking VIDEO GAMES right here
[2:31:44] <+Neoepochx> @ringabal Doomguy was always Human First anyway.
[2:31:47] <%Deadpal> Is hayden god now?
[2:31:51] <peachy996> @mostundesired sounds like Super Gore Nest
[2:31:52] <gunzerkingdunce> There are no challenges, just kill
[2:32:00] <+Neoepochx> @Deadpal VEGA is the "Father"
[2:32:03] <+OneGorillionDollars> THIS SONG IS CALLED "Hell on Earth" EVERYONE
[2:32:04] <%Deadpal> MAN Hayden played the long game.
[2:32:04] <JonEWorldbeater> SHOOT GUN
[2:32:06] <%Louie_Salmon> @deadpal Technically it might have been because DoomGuy's rabbit died
[2:32:09] <%OkamiDude15> naw hayden is just chilling in the doom fortress
[2:32:10] <peachy996> Oh sweet
[2:32:14] <Mister_McDerp> no more angels or demons, now is the age of man!
[2:32:16] <%GraceTBM> the existing rip of the soundtrack is just one rendition of a dynamic soundtrack, the official one will be different
[2:32:18] <%bensonplayspokemon> Objective: kill. Challenge: more kill.
[2:32:20] <+luketrapwalker> @OneGorillionDollars well done, sir
[2:32:20] <SleepyMaribo> yeyeyeyeyeyeyeye
[2:32:28] <SleepyMaribo> andthis is the 1st gauntlet
[2:32:29] <Saltmeisterr> i need mick to gives these songs actual names
[2:32:35] <+LandOfTheWay> if i could, i'd post that image of the Strange Journey Marine saying "YOU'VE GOT HUGE FORMA! RIP AND TEAR!"
[2:32:35] <TheAmazingClaytor> NO GODS, OR DEMONS, ONLY DOOM
[2:32:36] <%thegreenbenis> Holy fuck
[2:32:37] <%StaceMcGate> So why did Samur sabotage the Makyr race and force them to rely on Argent Energy?
[2:32:38] <+Tarage> I demand Emlo.
[2:32:40] <MrNoobMcSalt> I'd like to ask you a question. EXPLOSIONS?
[2:32:46] <+Neoepochx> @Saltmeisterr I know! I'm waiting for when they reveal track names.
[2:32:49] <+conradical> this was my favorite fight
[2:32:53] <ape_hawk> oh, just wait until the final room before icon of sin, pat
[2:32:56] <%Roundelay11> some of the later fights in this level are real fucking grinders
[2:33:00] <+Neoepochx> I want to know what the ARC Complex one is.
[2:33:02] <+conradical> i felt like such a badass here
[2:33:05] <KSDM> 50 MARAUDERS IN YOUR ASS Kreygasm
[2:33:13] <peachy996> Yeah Hayden is still stuck at the base without a body (cuz his old one is so fucked up) so it's gonna be hard for him to pull a fast one on the Doomslayer
[2:33:16] <%mankeyfigh> DOOM
[2:33:19] <gunzerkingdunce> The Ballista is so much cooler than the Gauss Cannon
[2:33:21] <%InugamiTheHound> @PatStaresAt what is your favorite/least favorite weapon in doom eternal?
[2:33:26] <%mighty_max_t> Maybe Sam wanted to be the next Kahn Mayker but wasnt chosen, so he's bitter?
[2:33:27] <%GraceTBM> this level will turn your asshole inside out if you haven't mastered the game
[2:33:28] <%StaceMcGate> Is multiplayer any good?
[2:33:30] <%Elky3> hell has flying meatballs rooVV
[2:33:32] <LittleBigQuebec> 13 naked marauders in the shower of the "Final Sin" KappaPride
[2:33:34] <+PhysicsLB> Just saw the isabelle/doomguy crossover vid, that shit was priceless
[2:33:50] <$megamonmon123> now you are playing with violence
[2:33:51] <%OkamiDude15> @StaceMcGate they were already doing that. samur just buffed doom guy so they would have a chance against the demon hordes
[2:33:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> ABOUT THAT
[2:34:00] <b_ikki> you dont even know
[2:34:01] <SleepyMaribo> bruh
[2:34:02] <+Neoepochx> So we all agree that Paige is Doomguy and Pat is Isabelle?
[2:34:02] <+GeneralHysterics> this ain't even the worst one yet
[2:34:03] <+superkeaton> LUL
[2:34:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:34:05] <+thefatfriend> This is just the tutorial level bitcg
[2:34:05] <SleepyMaribo> this is only the first one!
[2:34:05] <%GraceTBM> stop killing the grunts and tango with the real dudes
[2:34:07] <JonEWorldbeater> KILL ALL THE THINGS
[2:34:08] <+Javaa01> All the shit, fight it
[2:34:09] <UnfilteredComic> It can only get easier :)
[2:34:09] <%Aleate> RIP AND TEAR, UNTIL IT IS DONE
[2:34:09] <%Roundelay11> this is the LEAST of the gauntlets for this level
[2:34:12] <+cozysuu> now do it again
[2:34:12] <dking0000> Knowing what Samur did, it’s likely he knew about the Hell Argent deal and just thought fuck this. It’d explain the “different leadership” line.
[2:34:12] <peachy996> It's A gauntlet
[2:34:13] <%alcors_wisdom> fucking gantlet you say?
[2:34:14] <TheAmazingClaytor> YEYEYEYE
[2:34:21] <ataxia72> Just wait
[2:34:21] <hntronium> cut down to size
[2:34:23] <%Ner234> SourPls
[2:34:24] <%StaceMcGate> @OkamiDude15 they were only doing that because Samur stole the father from them. They wouldn't need Makyr energy before since they were immortal
[2:34:24] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> how THE FUCK is this gonna get more intense?
[2:34:34] <+Pookiedaexzile> This all they got?
[2:34:34] <gunzerkingdunce> Crucible vs Devil Sword Dante, which is cooler?
[2:34:35] <$megamonmon123> @mc_weak_to_arrow you will fucking see
[2:34:35] <+cozysuu> blood punch is so underrated
[2:34:41] <osiris1260> @mighty_max_t Khans aren’t chosen, they’re born, as far as the lore tells us there is no way to rise above your station. It is interesting he’s broken away from the hive though
[2:34:43] <%StaceMcGate> @OkamiDude15 I meant argent energy
[2:34:44] <Saltmeisterr> crucible easily
[2:34:48] <+Neoepochx> @StaceMcGate Yeah, but the Divinity Machine foretold of their destruction anyway.
[2:34:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> Whenever DoomGuy isn't Ripping and Tearing, you should be asking why isn't DoomGuy Ripping and Tearing?
[2:34:51] <StarvingPenguinGod> its gets really crazy tbh
[2:34:51] <Sol_Install> crucible yea
[2:34:54] <andresisant> Ultra Nightmare seems imposible
[2:34:57] <+Neoepochx> There must of been a reason for him to steal the Father away.
[2:35:08] <+AzureGale> Is this just one gigantic battle arena
[2:35:13] <%twistedj3ster> twistedj3ster subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! What would you think of streaming AC again once you've made significant progress?
[2:35:14] <%StaceMcGate> @Neoepochx seems more of a self-fulling prophecy that way
[2:35:24] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> @Th3SmartAlec LUL got me
[2:35:37] <+Neoepochx> I think that since Doomguy was a singularity in the timelines, that he did it to save himself
[2:35:43] <andresisant> The Icon´s of sin father it´s the betrayer
[2:35:45] <+Neoepochx> Because every other choice would have gotten him kileld.
[2:35:47] <%GraceTBM> to be perfectly honest, i feel like that music track was a little dry
[2:35:49] <+Neoepochx> killed*
[2:35:49] <%neVan0> WOO
[2:35:50] <%Aleate> One down :)
[2:35:50] <TheAmazingClaytor> That was worth ONE point.
[2:35:51] <$Chimeraelite> well goddMN
[2:35:57] <+green715> 1 weapon point
[2:35:59] <%mankeyfigh> I’m so lost
[2:36:00] <dking0000> Best guess for stealing the father is to stop all Maykr creation. Without Maykr tech, Hell cpuldnt be as strong so no more Maykr means no more Hell in a way
[2:36:03] <%Elky3> Has Boomer Pat enabled POGGERS yet?
[2:36:03] <%OkamiDude15> doom guy truly was the granblue fantasy all along evo19MindBlown
[2:36:03] <JonEWorldbeater> VIDYO GEYMS
[2:36:13] <+Delenay> each fight room is 1
[2:36:15] <+thefatfriend> Boy these fights are pretty tough, but i kinda thought it was over kill when they throw you into a 4' x 4' room with 6 marauders all of which are wearing revenant jetpacks, that one was really hard
[2:36:15] <Nupinoop296> hi pat, hi chat
[2:36:16] <%StaceMcGate> I'm just gonna say.... Everything is Hayden's fault
[2:36:20] <boomstickery> youd think at some point theyd stop sending the jobbers
[2:36:21] <$RetroCop87> Everyone keeps asking about streaming AC. It's significantly better as a "5 minutes before the real stream update" format than a full stream
[2:36:21] <j0ustar> Serenity on one side, demon sigils in the other. how subtle!
[2:36:24] <+xBiggestD> what difficulty?
[2:36:28] <CrazyMedicine> UV
[2:36:28] <SleepyMaribo> this fight, is BULLSHIT on nightmare
[2:36:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Nupinoop296 Im chat
[2:36:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> The Makyr are pretentious fucks who love ruling over mortals. You gonna tell me they wouldn't use argent anyways? Even if they were still getting replacement Khans from Father, bitch would still want to live forever.
[2:36:34] <%Tearonex> get ready Pat there are more then a few encounters
[2:36:34] <Odetokale> endgame starts now!
[2:36:36] <$megamonmon123> @xbiggestd ultra violencr
[2:36:36] <+GeneralHysterics> yo buckle up
[2:36:36] <blue_falcon_fight_club> only 4 more
[2:36:39] <+Neoepochx> PUNCH
[2:36:40] <Mister_McDerp> the Maykrs did everything wrong
[2:36:41] <peachy996> All these question have NO ANSWERS at the end. It's surprising.
[2:36:43] <RantingRavager> TUTORIAL OVER
[2:36:50] <Nupinoop296> @doc_ock_rokc brownJOKES
[2:36:51] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> fight 2 and 3 arent so bad or long, but then hold onto your asshole
[2:36:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> buckle up buttercup
[2:36:54] <+Neoepochx> @peachy996 Gotta save up for the Sequel.
[2:37:02] <%StaceMcGate> @GeneralSCPatton were they expanding and dominating other species before the Father's absence?
[2:37:03] <%linkster291> The real doom starts now.
[2:37:04] <Ultimatefool> SERENITY (subtle)
[2:37:04] <%mighty_max_t> Luckily we have TWO story dlcs coming
[2:37:05] <TheAmazingClaytor> "This is great! And all I've done is enter my name!"
[2:37:08] <peachy996> Is't there DLC for Single Player coming?
[2:37:09] <Saltmeisterr> they could flesh out the lore in later campaigns
[2:37:10] <Tha_Mik> Haha One!
[2:37:12] <dking0000> There are story DLC planned. Wouldn’t be surprised if they followed it up
[2:37:14] <+Neoepochx> DLC most likely will just answer what happened in between 2016 and Eternal
[2:37:16] <$megamonmon123> gotta work hard for your weapon points pat
[2:37:17] <osiris1260> @dking0000 No more Makyr means STRONGER hell, but less demons paradoxically. They can now enter and leave any dimensions they please but they won’t have the invasive forces like before
[2:37:26] <reddpop_> this would be the perfect spot to hide a lone doot
[2:37:29] <SleepyMaribo> missed a punchable wall
[2:37:32] <Monkeyweed21> missed a wall
[2:37:32] <+Delenay> lol back across wall
[2:37:38] <AlvinTheLiar> where you punched the guy
[2:37:40] <peachy996> I hope they follow it up because damn the lore blueballs lol
[2:37:41] <JonEWorldbeater> Consider: Shoot
[2:37:42] <+Delenay> back down where the 1 goon was
[2:37:47] <%StaceMcGate> Hell wasn't FED until Father went TOP
[2:37:50] <%Piemen99> what were they shooting at?
[2:37:54] <gunzerkingdunce> Gun kils too good
[2:37:57] <%Piemen99> each other?
[2:38:03] <Monkeyweed21> you missed a wall
[2:38:08] <%GraceTBM> demons shoot at each other
[2:38:09] <+Delenay> back down
[2:38:11] <+Delenay> at bottom
[2:38:12] <+Tarage> Have you considered not being on fire?
[2:38:14] <SleepyMaribo> go down
[2:38:16] <+Neoepochx> Never back down Kappa
[2:38:17] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> back downstairs
[2:38:20] <wrightlight94> Go down
[2:38:21] <+Delenay> second jump had wall
[2:38:21] <ScreamLord> That's coward talk
[2:38:26] <awalr> dig up stupid
[2:38:31] <MasterTonberry23> Did you assume the Icon's gender Sam Kappa
[2:38:31] <Monkeyweed21> 111111
[2:38:31] <%StaceMcGate> Are there any humans alive on Earth anymore?
[2:38:32] <%wsintai> Dig stupid, up!

[2:52:53] <%alcors_wisdom> @OkamiDude15 good pull
[2:53:00] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt you didn't crucible kill him? Disappointing.
[2:53:02] <%Valdorick> "Aw man, he only shoots me when I'm at JUST medium distance."
[2:53:04] <%GraceTBM> this is an easier fight with him than his intro
[2:53:10] <kappamutton> this enemy suckx
[2:53:12] <gunzerkingdunce> I love that the Super Shotgun ACTUALLY is kinda like a sword agisnt the Marauder
[2:53:13] <%QuadraticGravity> Try the crucible?w
[2:53:22] <peachy996> Actually that reminds me, Did the Icon of Sin fight ever glitch out for anyone else when they played?
[2:53:26] <Zeninjasloth> crucuble don't work
[2:53:29] <+superkeaton> Uh
[2:53:30] <%Farples> You can't kill him with the crucible
[2:53:34] <+superkeaton> He might be immortal?
[2:53:35] <%OkamiDude15> remember when they talked about being able to invade peoples games like dark souls? yeah me neither since it seems like that didnt get put into the final product
[2:53:37] <gunzerkingdunce> It can but it's kinda buggy
[2:53:41] <StarvingPenguinGod> lock on rockets work tho BrainSlug

[2:54:09] <%OkamiDude15> @GraceTBM ah gotcha
[2:54:09] <Captain_Aham> you can get 2 shots off with the SS once he's staggered
[2:54:10] <$numerohoowan> I've never seen him break like that
[2:54:15] <grimrjak> combo into another weapon
[2:54:16] <%SpicyVibration> No one was expected to fight him this long
[2:54:17] <+Flunkorg> @LittleBigQuebec Actually, thats sort of false. Theirs a window where you can one shot him with the bfg. Its very hard to do.
[2:54:19] <peachy996> @TheAmazingClaytor He was stuck doing an endless Death beam actually and a body part took zero damage
[2:54:19] <Magicferret> Ballista deals more dmg
[2:54:22] <%StaceMcGate> y'all seen those no damage runs with marauders?
[2:54:22] <+UnwoundCaesar70> I think they said they are still working on invasion
[2:54:24] <%alcors_wisdom> no one was meant to fight a maurader this long
[2:54:25] <%GraceTBM> wtf with this
[2:54:31] <+Neoepochx> Is he trying to get a Glory Kill?
[2:54:32] <%GraceTBM> why won't he die

[2:59:56] <%wsintai> Is the Crucible Blade a temporary buff or something?
[2:59:56] <xinexes> revinant
[2:59:57] <%SpicyVibration> SWORD PAT
[2:59:58] <%psychodave1234> SWORD IS A CONSUMABLE IT IS FOR EMERGENCIES
[2:59:59] <a_timberdoodle> Crucible
[2:59:59] <%OkamiDude15> @Nihilisticdestroyer usually feels like it takes too long to charge up
[3:00:05] <%tusk102> @wsintai it deletes one enemy
[3:00:11] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt I think that is them entering a Stagger State. He just got a big huge stun without the stagger glow. So if you find one more marauder, try to glory kill if they're stunned?
[3:00:17] <mostundesired> LUL
[3:00:17] <%tusk102> @wsintai but has limited ammo
[3:00:17] <+GeneralHysterics> ANUTHA ONE

[3:00:31] <%thegreenbenis> Thanks Pat.
[3:00:32] <mostundesired> Let's go, one more!
[3:00:33] <NeroInfinite> Such as big cyber demons
[3:00:34] <+Neoepochx> Problem Solver.
[3:00:35] <%psychodave1234> THE GOBALINS
[3:00:35] <grimrjak> big problems
[3:00:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> sync
[3:00:38] <osiris1260> This level was actual hell on lives mode. Lost lives save even if you load save so you have to just do it in one go and beat the level with more than 10
[3:00:38] <%BeatBo_2> Sword is problem solving
[3:00:40] <%BeatBo_2> gun is for fun
[3:00:45] <UnfilteredComic> Did pat say in stream 1 why he is using controller?
[3:00:50] <LtThunderbolt> bugged
[3:00:52] <%Pyroclase> did you accidentally turn off the glory kill highlight?
[3:00:52] <%wsintai> @tusk102 Thanks, but I was joking about Pat being unable to use it because it's secretly a temp buff :P
[3:00:53] <%tusk102> gdi

[3:02:22] <MasterTonberry23> Pat's not really talking so he's doing quite well. Now if he was trying really hard to also do running commentary he'd be doing a lot worse. It's actually kinda hard to play well AND do entertaining commentary at the same time
[3:02:23] <RyanTheRecluse> nightmare is not a fun difficulty until super gore nest
[3:02:24] <+VHGS> Hellmo

[3:11:20] <%코코꾸라> what bridge
[3:11:21] <FeelinNifty> ha ha wouldn't it be funny if doomman stubbed his toe and said the f word
[3:11:22] <Darkrenai> And then the Doom Guy missed a jump and fell into a pit. The End
[3:11:23] <TheAmazingClaytor> And so the Slayer bumped his head.
[3:11:24] <+GeneralHysterics> look down
[3:11:25] <+theman515> No no wait, that's not how the story ends

[3:11:35] <ringabal> Doomguy died on the way back to his home planet
[3:11:36] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt "and so kratos cast himself from the highest mountain..."
[3:11:42] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt The "|Lemmy is God" line was just a straight up reference to Motorhead LUL

[3:12:01] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I saw someone trip over their shoelaaces, knock their trachea against a desk on their way down, and fucking suffocate to death. The things that will kill are pretty random.
[3:12:02] <RunningNGunning> ...And that was the end of Doom Guy
[3:12:04] <%mankeyfigh> I’m pretty sure a cliff fall couldn’t kill him
[3:12:05] <osiris1260> @konquerer NO

[3:17:56] <%Rafferty3231> it's the downcoming boss!
[3:17:56] <%bensonplayspokemon> “It was me, Doomguy! It was me ALL ALONG!” - John Romero, actually
[3:18:02] <MasterTonberry23> Now is this a better, or worse fight then the Spider Mastermind?
[3:18:05] <grimrjak> dooguy is a sith?
[3:18:07] <osiris1260> GIGA STAN
[3:18:08] <Zeninjasloth> better imo
[3:18:08] <+GeneralHysterics> That's the giga satan all right
[3:18:09] <peachy996> Bigger fight
[3:18:23] <%GraceTBM> it uses more of the mechanics in this fight than spider
[3:18:24] <alextrebeken> is this the final boss?
[3:18:30] <jorniev> YES
[3:18:31] <+green715> I think micro missiles work better, but IDK
[3:18:33] <%GraceTBM> final boss first phase
[3:18:34] <TheAmazingClaytor> He's a real tanky boi

[3:18:57] <Dstatus> Bopped
[3:19:00] <jorniev> does he have the other BIG gun?
[3:19:03] <CappuccinoGuil> Honestly, save the BFG ammo to BFG the ads
[3:19:04] <%jiin6> you turned your back on sin, a costly mistake
[3:19:06] <+Tarage> Imagine if Pat gets a game over
[3:19:09] <MasterTonberry23> Remember not to stand in the fire
[3:19:11] <thegreatsun> Stand still and turn slowly, that's a neat trick
[3:19:13] <JonEWorldbeater> SHOOT MORE WITH GUN
[3:19:15] <%brackboi> BFG is better
[3:19:17] <+LandOfTheWay> yeah, he's a real boss this time
[3:19:19] <Darkrenai> Fire indeed hot

[3:19:29] <Dstatus> THE PUNCH Kreygasm
[3:19:35] <xxmagonx> bfg is better
[3:19:36] <%sjay449> I don't know doom lore well... but is this like the 4th time Doom Guy has killed this thing?
[3:19:37] <%OkamiDude15> @Tarage no game overs unless its one up mode or ultra nightmare
[3:19:40] <%Valdorick> He's Bloodpunching you
[3:19:41] <%GraceTBM> maybe the game bugged for me, cause bfg didn't insta kill a part
[3:19:42] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt normal bfg is good also
[3:19:42] <TheAmazingClaytor> One tiddy down
[3:19:44] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt BFG is better for him
[3:19:44] <%Louie_Salmon> I wish the Unmaykr was better. It's probably good for a speedrun of the fight
[3:19:44] <Fancypants25> Is it me or is the music a little slow for what's going on?
[3:19:44] <%SkyPirateArcane> Theres a super health in the middle of the arena in the air
[3:19:45] <TobikoOfWind> @sjay449 I think just the second
[3:19:46] <+machinetoys> does he mean 2,3 or 2016?
[3:19:50] <xxmagonx> use BFG
[3:19:55] <+Lizard0TM> Is Pat not gonna grab the Quad damage?
[3:19:55] <+Neoepochx> There are a multitude of enemies for you to Sword
[3:19:55] <DrCrow85> imagine doing this with one life
[3:19:58] <peachy996> If you use the BFG you have to Aim it well so it doesn't whiff
[3:19:58] <%Roundelay11> sword to regen health

[3:20:06] <MasterTonberry23> @DrCrow85 He is doing this with one life

[3:20:20] <Laicuss> huge whiff
[3:20:20] <+GeneralHysterics> aw man bfg hit the unarmored spot
[3:20:22] <grimrjak> pat actally hit something with the BFG
[3:20:24] <R3c0n31> Unmaayker is way better, BFG dont do nothing but direct hit
[3:20:33] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt the mega heaalth
[3:20:38] <+Neoepochx> But BFG direct hits do more burst damage
[3:20:38] <%Aeoneth> arbalest 3 shots i think
[3:20:44] <$megamonmon123> fuel is also infinate
[3:20:44] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt theres a blue orb
[3:20:47] <%GraceTBM> chainsaw dudes for health
[3:20:53] <boomstickery> try your sword on him
[3:20:57] <%Valdorick> The sound track is ripping farts?
[3:20:59] <peachy996> I disagree, I can get that damage with minimal fuss with a BFG
[3:20:59] <%OkamiDude15> do you want big number or do combo?
[3:20:59] <%DRAGKUDO> wow this boss fight really is dick
[3:21:02] <%neVan0> theres so much bullshit happening
[3:21:08] <R3c0n31> Do not try the sword on him
[3:21:08] <%Tearonex> he's got all that blood punch and not using it
[3:21:08] <reddpop_> this seems appropriately difficult
[3:21:11] <+Pookiedaexzile> Why don't giant enemies ever just knock down the building
[3:21:19] <+Neoepochx> No, Megaspheres do not respawn
[3:21:19] <$anita_dickin> no
[3:21:24] <$megamonmon123> nope
[3:21:25] <+Javaa01> Nope, the sphere is a one off
[3:21:25] <%tusk102> megaspheres dont
[3:21:28] <+Neoepochx> Only Sword Gas and Bloodpunch
[3:21:31] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt Balista+Turret Minigun, refill as needed, makes the fight pretty easy
[3:21:35] <%D00msDayDan> fake them out with the crucible then chainsaw them, i like it
[3:21:54] <bigbreh> I love this boss fight, its a test of your skills built throughout the whole game
[3:21:54] <+green715> I heard micromissiles work well , but I'm not positive
[3:21:56] <MasterTonberry23> Icon of Sin sez: "No, YOU fuck off"
[3:21:59] <$jacob2pop> It's amazing to me how a goat ended up being one of the animal representations of pure evil
[3:22:07] <peachy996> I bet this is really fun with Infinite Ammo
[3:22:11] <boomstickery> crazy talk
[3:22:20] <+Tarage> What if the Icon of Sin was a giant goose?
[3:22:25] <%GraceTBM> goats have those crazy eyes it's why they seem evil
[3:22:25] <+maenos2> goats got creepy eyes
[3:22:28] <peachy996> Of course it's probably trivial too what with BFG being infinite
[3:22:30] <+maenos2> ergo evil
[3:22:31] <%Agami23> the fact that doomguy can take punchs from this thing is nuts
[3:22:32] <MasterTonberry23> Amazing use of rockets there Patty Kappa

[3:26:30] <+maenos2> right tiddy exposed
[3:26:36] <%SpicyVibration> ELMO WILL NEVER DIE U FUCK
[3:26:42] <mostundesired> So, what you're saying is, this boss fight is... A DPS RACE
[3:26:47] <omen_setter> you must calm the Icon of Sin's tits
[3:26:51] <%GraceTBM> is chaingun hitscan w fake projectiles?
[3:26:52] <%necrocannibal2> what's the difference between the sword and the chainsaw?
[3:27:01] <%Maids4lyfe> the chainsaw is for making ammo
[3:27:03] <peachy996> Keep stripping the Icon of Sin
[3:27:04] <+Pookiedaexzile> IS there a way we can make the icon of sin smaller, and have doom guys move set
[3:27:06] <$jacob2pop> damn Icon, you need to trim them nails
[3:27:07] <%Maids4lyfe> and can't kill big demons
[3:27:07] <+GeneralHysterics> no it shoots projectioles
[3:27:09] <%wsintai> @SpicyVibration Elmo died years ago, he just hasnt realized it
[3:27:10] <+GeneralHysterics> they're fast tho
[3:27:11] <Tha_Mik> Thats lewd
[3:27:11] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @rumtumtugnutz nope, never have, also, your name is a reference to the Cats musical, isn't it?
[3:27:12] <+AtlasMcCoy> Chainsaw gives ammo but needs more juice for big beefy guts
[3:27:15] <%Maids4lyfe> the sword can kill big demons
[3:27:16] <%GraceTBM> @necrocannibal2 sword has three charges that don't refill and instakills chainsaw recharges one pip and gives ammo
[3:27:17] <%bensonplayspokemon> The only sin here is Icon not showing tiddy sooner
[3:27:19] <jorniev> sword is for SWORDMASTER combos
[3:27:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Elmo is still looking for the Tie
[3:27:27] <%necrocannibal2> @GraceTBM oh, thanks
[3:27:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> @admiral_popnfresh sort of.
[3:27:33] <%Elky3> psaBlep

[3:32:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> BIG
[3:32:13] <mostundesired> OH shit.

[3:32:32] <+nirvana227> PogChamp
[3:32:33] <gunzerkingdunce> Obliterate the tiddy
[3:32:34] <boomstickery> nae tits nae more
[3:32:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt It wouldn't be a demonic final boss without summon meteor
[3:32:38] <jazzygrooves__> just a lovetap
[3:32:38] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig damage
[3:32:38] <%GraceTBM> i guess it is pretty good
[3:32:39] <+Neoepochx> You have some unmaykr ammo left.
[3:32:40] <+Estuko> @jorniev he should dual wield my throat and my thigh.
[3:32:41] <Zeninjasloth> unmayker vs bfg: do combo vs big number
[3:32:41] <+Estuko> Sorry
[3:32:42] <+Neoepochx> No?
[3:32:43] <shotgang86> right in the tiddy
[3:32:46] <%OkamiDude15> big ol victory lap
[3:32:46] <%redrins> kind of a wet fart
[3:32:47] <$Wafflum> Why fight when you can MURDER?
[3:32:48] <+Neoepochx> @Zeninjasloth So true
[3:32:48] <peachy996> Thing is you gotta aim and when it comes to the arms that's where it gets tricky
[3:32:49] <%bensonplayspokemon> S Q U I S H
[3:32:50] <$jacob2pop> You are literally skinning this thing alive
[3:32:52] <gekizenbu> praise the BFG and pass the ammunition
[3:32:53] <+CherteuseKapibara> Titties - Eliminated
[3:32:54] <%ElkRiverDog> The Crucible, aka “Imma yoink your guts”
[3:32:55] <jorniev> woah
[3:32:56] <%mankeyfigh> The TIDDIES
[3:33:02] <+Delenay> i mean... this guy isnt too bad, just shoot the 10000 at him
[3:33:07] <%Louie_Salmon> BFG ammo doesn't respawn though, so good luck with the other half of that health
[3:33:09] <jorniev> TIDDY SLASH
[3:33:18] <jorniev> quad damage
[3:33:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt he is a huge bitch
[3:33:21] <VritraReiRei> @bevyrage isnt that an Overcharge?
[3:33:21] <%Griffin1171> man, this fight sucks
[3:33:23] <awalr> tags: [breast reduction]
[3:33:28] <LittleBigQuebec> head not dead
[3:33:29] <+Neoepochx> Casting Meteo again.
[3:33:29] <%bevyrage> is it?
[3:33:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> TWO
[3:33:34] <%bevyrage> they look too similar to me
[3:33:37] <jorniev> purple orb is quad damage
[3:33:38] <+Neoepochx> And now lazor
[3:33:42] <Dstatus> carciChill
[3:33:44] <%GraceTBM> honestly, i think this would be a little better with a slightly slower attack pattern, more damage, and less health
[3:33:45] <%Valdorick> I like how the Icon of Sin is also weapon swapping and spamm ing the BFG at you
[3:33:47] <+krispen_wa> Gojira Lazor
[3:33:48] <%mighty_max_t> Imagine a Shotgun only playthrough
[3:33:51] <BeefyQueefer> Pat smeels
[3:33:52] <dking0000> Still got Unmaykr ammo
[3:33:54] <+GeneralHysterics> trim those nails
[3:33:58] <cardboardboots> micromissle is also great for this fight
[3:33:59] <%GraceTBM> yes dash into the fire
[3:33:59] <omen_setter> I wanna poke him
[3:33:59] <+Pookiedaexzile> MICKIE G hitting all the notes for thi one
[3:34:01] <%Elky3> it would've been a lot cooler if BFG was playing chariCRY
[3:34:03] <+Haducant> USE THE SUPER SHOTTY up close
[3:34:04] <%DRAGKUDO> yes bath in the flames
[3:34:05] <+maenos2> dick for last
[3:34:09] <+Delenay> I would like to see this fight from the Icon's POV
[3:34:13] <+Cavumentum> This Shadow of the Colossus sequel sure is weird
[3:34:14] <thegreatsun> Someone please tell pat that fire is hot
[3:34:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:34:18] <+Neoepochx> Don't forget about the megasphere.
[3:34:19] <boomstickery> that swrd is a real problem solver
[3:34:20] <+nirvana227> LUL
[3:34:21] <mostundesired> Always leave the dick for last.
[3:34:21] <%Louie_Salmon> Doomguy having a heated gamer moment I see
[3:34:21] <grimrjak> hug ducks
[3:34:21] <+Delenay> Just some little green man zipping around
[3:34:26] <+AtlasMcCoy> You know its honestly quite impressive that pats beating this game on hard with a controller instead of mkb
[3:34:29] <+PhysicsLB> GET THE DICK
[3:34:30] <BeefyQueefer> !uptime
[3:34:30] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 34m.
[3:34:30] <Nupinoop296> SWORD
[3:34:33] <%TheWinged7> rocket lauingher?
[3:34:35] <Zeninjasloth> secret final boss, just as the icon is at a single pixel of health left, maurader shows up and glory kills it first to absorb it's power
[3:34:36] <osiris1260> Does the meat hook work for this fight? I never thought about it before
[3:34:37] <+Neoepochx> Icon this tijme "NO STOP BEING SO FAST DOOMGUY"
[3:34:42] <+ascii3647> destroyed them titties first
[3:34:48] <%sjay449> @Delenay the multiplayer shows what the demons see when fighting doom slayer. It's fucked
[3:34:49] <+DJLavender> final bosses tend to suck. i would say this does it better than most.
[3:34:54] <%GraceTBM> there's no targeting icon for the meathook
[3:35:00] <+Estuko> @AtlasMcCoy my brain keeps going "M'ckebuh" instead of "Mouse and KeyBoard
[3:35:06] <%GraceTBM> this is at least making you use most of your tools
[3:35:07] <%OkamiDude15> @AtlasMcCoy its not too hard on controller considering you also have an aim assist sfhEH
[3:35:08] <boomstickery> @sjay449 fucked how?
[3:35:09] <+Berbzz> why no rocket launcher Pat?!
[3:35:11] <+maenos2> slink away
[3:35:20] <+Neoepochx> MEGASPHERE
[3:35:23] <%cylish> As far as DMC games go I like this a lot better than savior
[3:35:24] <%GraceTBM> he moves too much for reliable rocket launcher
[3:35:27] <%Faustgesicht> I like how this fight is just "MY FOOD. MINE"
[3:35:29] <%D00msDayDan> why does the icon of sin not simply walk away after realizing doomslayer's too hot for him
[3:35:34] <%OkamiDude15> rockets take to long to reach
[3:35:36] <jorniev> where is dante when you need him
[3:35:38] <Enemy_In_Disguise> I really hope Romero’s head is inside that model
[3:35:40] <+AzureGale> Talk to the fist
[3:35:46] <LoganPayne> "can someone stupid please get in my way" -- me with the crucible out
[3:35:48] <Zeninjasloth> doomguy can teleport, there's no running
[3:35:48] <+DJLavender> @berbzz rocket launcher is too slow for this fight. and you cant lock on.
[3:35:49] <%GraceTBM> uh, you don't need dante right now you have the slayer
[3:35:52] <+Neoepochx> I like plasma tbh
[3:35:55] <osiris1260> Speaking of DMC, I have a question. Who’s older, Lady or Nero?
[3:35:56] <%sjay449> @boomstickery he is fucking flying across the map and is literally invincible as he chainsaws your comrade demons
[3:35:59] <ataxia72> does he want to look Huge by beating this without using the megasphere
[3:35:59] <mostundesired> It's a lot of dick.
[3:35:59] <boomstickery> thats what she said
[3:35:59] <%Tearonex> Still need his head I think]
[3:36:01] <jorniev> WUICK DO A DISTORTED REAL IMPACT
[3:36:01] <%Louie_Salmon> enough
[3:36:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> 5/8ths of his dick is left
[3:36:02] <+krispen_wa> Too much of his dick
[3:36:04] <%tusk102> 5/8 dick is left @PatStaresAt
[3:36:06] <+maenos2> oh he big and throbbing still

[3:36:46] <%Farples> Don't think you finished destroying his head
[3:36:47] <%Valdorick> wait, his head still has some HP?
[3:36:53] <+Neoepochx> @Valdorick yea
[3:37:00] <+Neoepochx> He only killed the pecs and the right arm
[3:37:02] <%OkamiDude15> didnt kill the head yet
[3:37:03] <Curly_Sparkle> i like how every time the icon of sin screams, it sounds like the startup of the ps2
[3:37:15] <%GraceTBM> i hate going into slowdown for this fight
[3:37:23] <jorniev> PAT MOVING AT THE PSEED OF MURDER
[3:37:25] <LtThunderbolt> so no head?

[3:59:39] <$anita_dickin> Lady is older, nero would have been like 5 at the time
[3:59:39] <Zeninjasloth> they left a shitton of stuff to be explained in the next one
[3:59:40] <%rytyoung> This game has so many improvements over Doom 2016
[3:59:42] <Neo_Kaiser> Now to stream Ultra Violence.

[3:59:47] <R3c0n31> The Movement is too Addicting. Yea you can speedrun them under 20 min
[3:59:47] <awalr> which was fucking useless

[3:59:51] <%Pyroclase> useless crouch buttons are a tradtion, really
[3:59:51] <+BubbaRands> Man this looking whiter than Antarctica LUL
[3:59:51] <%Binary_Fireball> imagining flynn crouching
[3:59:52] <osiris1260> Apparently there’s a Daisy in every level
[3:59:52] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[3:59:53] <%rytyoung> It definitely didn't need a crouch
[3:59:53] <TobikoOfWind> I think Lord of Darkness stuff is meant to be a plot hook for the next one
[3:59:55] <%trustycoyote> Agreed. Replay a level and they will feel perfectly fine
[3:59:55] <ringabal> Can't wait until the DoomMech and SUPER GOD DLCs
[3:59:56] <Mister_McDerp> it had crouching?
[3:59:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> There's definitely going to be another Doom game
[3:59:58] <peachy996> Remember the Crouch Button and the Handgun?
[3:59:58] <%OkamiDude15> @nirvana227 its probably gonna be the big bad of the next doom
[3:59:59] <SchroedingersFerret> Why can't Doom crouch

[4:02:25] <%StaceMcGate> Just say BFG or SWORD
[4:02:25] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Plasma rifle sounds so weeny
[4:02:29] <gunzerkingdunce> I miss the two trigger pull for the Super Shotgun
[4:02:31] <Diana869> it doesnt feel strong
[4:02:31] <%luftraumm1> kind of a bland game 2016 was way better
[4:02:31] <+nekodelic> ssword
[4:02:32] <Josef_Stryker> Chaingun is soooo much better than 2016's version
[4:02:34] <Zeninjasloth> imagine the horror of the doom equivalent of those few bloody palace levels you hate
[4:02:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> Easy Mode clip is up LUL
[4:02:37] <peachy996> Plasma Rifle is so beefy though
[4:02:39] <Monkeyweed21> NOW BEAT THE GAME ON STADIA
[4:02:39] <awalr> plasma is way better than in 2016 tho
[4:02:40] <Zeninjasloth> you know the ones
[4:02:40] <%Binary_Fireball> stick shotgun is best boi
[4:02:41] <Captain_Aham> Unmayker is pretty great
[4:02:45] <Yummy_Nukes> cats truly are the most mysterious creatures of all
[4:02:45] <SenpaiMD> rocket launcher feels way worse in eternal
[4:02:46] <Diana869> way better than 2016 shotgun
[4:02:48] <Nano_osecond> glad they ditched that pistol
[4:02:49] <%Ner234> Full Auto on it is pretty good
[4:02:51] <%OkamiDude15> ballista is servicable
[4:02:51] <%WhereIsWill> auto shotgun mod is the truth
[4:02:54] <+Pookiedaexzile> So why did you only use the one
[4:02:55] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt So one of the DLCs is apparently going to be inbetween 2016 and this, which is why Doomguy had the Sentinal token at the start, from killing the priests Guardian
[4:02:57] <+Neoepochx> @PatStaresAt You know what is interesting...I hated using the scope in 2016, but in this one with the weakness, I think I like it better than micro missiles
[4:02:58] <%StaceMcGate> 2016 Minigun was garbage
[4:02:58] <+kilikhelios> the blast on the plasma is so good though
[4:02:59] <bigbreh> Plasma Rile is nutty tho, especially with the blast mod
[4:03:00] <Fenlig> What would you like from a new Doom 3?
[4:03:03] <%GraceTBM> rocket launcher was a rifle in 2016
[4:03:07] <Onmi_Khaos> the Ballista is the Gauss Cannon but they nerfed Siege Mode
[4:03:07] <%trustycoyote> Default shotty is the comfort gun. Reliable and effective.
[4:03:10] <%PanicSwytch> ANIMAL CROSSING AND RE REV2?
[4:03:10] <Diana869> both are bland for me
[4:03:10] <+Haducant> Lock on maxed out is pretty damn good
[4:03:10] <+Lizard0TM> Can't wait for the Doom Slayer mods for DMC5
[4:03:15] <%luftraumm1> gauss cannon is way better than balista
[4:03:17] <R3c0n31> it was the same thing but you were immune to splash in 2016
[4:03:18] <+rottingpastry> rocket launcher is basically the same, you just don't fight in corridors as much
[4:03:20] <Maverick2736> rocket launcher in 2016 sucked, what are you talking about chat?
[4:03:20] <%BeatBo_2> they upped self-damage for sure
[4:03:23] <%Agami23> i barely used the lockon
[4:03:24] <%Niney_Who> Yeah I preferred Gauss Cannon to Ballista
[4:03:25] <+AcidBrandon> Lockon is OP
[4:03:26] <osiris1260> After this you should check milestones and check out the challenge runs.
[4:03:26] <+ArcanumMBD> Remote Detonation mastered is great for clearing groups
[4:03:28] <%hmgirlpopuri> It was good for summoners but that's about it
[4:03:28] <%marsantas> What do you want for the sequel?
[4:03:30] <%GraceTBM> the remote det in this one was terrible in comparison
[4:03:31] <%Katashi25> @patstaresat if they were to add new weapons in the DLCs, what weapons would you want to see?
[4:03:32] <Tucker0603> I miss GAUSS-CHAN
[4:03:33] <King_Wolf_Rigger> NO PISTOL YAY
[4:03:34] <%linkster291> Rocket Launcher was the same, just had a lot more ammo for it.
[4:03:35] <Monkeyweed21> Beat Ultra Violence on Stadia now
[4:03:37] <mostundesired> I clapped when I played it.
[4:03:37] <jenji919> How do you feel about limited ammo
[4:03:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> MECHS
[4:03:39] <Tha_Mik> Every weapon has an use
[4:03:39] <$jacob2pop> Time to play on Doomguy Must Die mode
[4:03:41] <%OkamiDude15> @luftraumm1 im guessing thats why they changed it since gauss cannon deleted enemies
[4:03:41] <Onmi_Khaos> The Ballista IS Gauss-Chan
[4:03:42] <Neo_Kaiser> The detonate RL mod is useful against Marauders.
[4:03:42] <Jolly_Adventurer> MECHAS
[4:03:42] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt Favorite Boss?
[4:03:43] <%SvenHolgersson> DOOMGIRL
[4:03:44] <Diana869> in 5 years
[4:03:44] <%Pyroclase> the sequel needs mechs
[4:03:45] <Visorak6> MECHA
[4:03:45] <+nirvana227> just moreee PogChamp
[4:03:45] <dking0000> Ballista needed to be worse than the Gaus. Gaus was way too good.
[4:03:45] <gunzerkingdunce> @Lizard0TM Gimme Dante's summon swords as Crucibles
[4:03:46] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> 2016 was just plasma stun, super shotty and guass cannon by the end
[4:03:46] <UnfilteredComic> What sequel
[4:03:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> You where NOT immune to rocket splash in 2016
[4:03:48] <Mister_McDerp> FIGHT PURGATORY NEXT
[4:03:48] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Mechs is a good answer
[4:03:48] <R3c0n31> WE GET A COUNTER BUTTON
[4:03:49] <BeefyQueefer> More levels but shorter levels.
[4:03:51] <%Konquerer> DOOM MECH
[4:03:51] <StarvingPenguinGod> I liked ballista a lot
[4:03:52] <KingVantq> A 50hr doom game
[4:03:53] <%SpicyVibration> HAIL SATAN
[4:03:54] <%DRAGKUDO> Doomboy
[4:03:54] <jorniev> a gun called the doom
[4:03:54] <%trustycoyote> Having BFG on the radial menu is weird to think about LUL
[4:03:55] <+Talbz> You like the Doom Hunter?
[4:03:55] <Saltmeisterr> MMECHAS
[4:03:55] <Tucker0603> WE NEED MECHA
[4:03:57] <%GraceTBM> fav boss is glad
[4:03:57] <%DappercatEsquire> The lore in Eternal felt like it was very close to overbearing
[4:03:58] <%Niney_Who> Gladiator is so good
[4:04:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yeah Gladiator
[4:04:01] <R3c0n31> KER EN TUK
[4:04:01] <Them00n> Khan Makyr for me
[4:04:01] <%Maids4lyfe> Gladiator was cool
[4:04:02] <+Neoepochx> @PatStaresAt What do you think of the story reveals in this one?
[4:04:04] <Josef_Stryker> ADD MECHA
[4:04:04] <Jakeofalco> good video game
[4:04:04] <+AzureGale> Animal Crossing crossover
[4:04:04] <%neVan0> YEAH
[4:04:05] <+rottingpastry> plasma rifle has a reason to exist other than stun yay
[4:04:05] <%valriot> Half the bosses were just enemies LUL
[4:04:05] <%Niney_Who> Best music is his theme too
[4:04:05] <TheAmazingClaytor> KAR EN TUK
[4:04:06] <Tha_Mik> yeyeye
[4:04:06] <$jacob2pop> Favorite funko pop dempn
[4:04:08] <peachy996> I like Icon but Gladdy is okay too
[4:04:08] <jenji919> Fight GOD
[4:04:09] <King_Wolf_Rigger> That was a good fight.
[4:04:09] <jorniev> REALLY?
[4:04:09] <%TIME_PUNCHER> ah bugger, missed it. Youtube VOD pleb for me!
[4:04:11] <RyanTheRecluse> gladiator
[4:04:11] <pillowwasp> Add mech
[4:04:12] <Yummy_Nukes> it would've been great if the sword was on a cooldown timer like the chainsaw
[4:04:12] <Mister_McDerp> Gladiator had best music
[4:04:13] <j0ustar> 5000 photos later
[4:04:16] <CrypticMochi> Shoot bigger thing, rip bigger thing
[4:04:23] <invader_rin> You pissed off God and you haven't even fought the Dark Lord, of course there's going to be a sequel.
[4:04:25] <ringabal> Workshopping the sequel title: Doom 3: The better Doom 3
[4:04:25] <+purelyplum> 2016 soundtrack compared to eternal soundtrack
[4:04:27] <R3c0n31> Now there is New Setup
[4:04:28] <Josef_Stryker> Most annoying enemy to fight and why is it the Archville?
[4:04:29] <Darkrenai> Say tan
[4:04:33] <%Niney_Who> Satan AND God
[4:04:35] <King_Wolf_Rigger> The Lord of Darkness
[4:04:36] <andresisant> I think this one it´s gonna get a lot of DLC for the single player
[4:04:36] <%Maids4lyfe> THE DARK LORD
[4:04:39] <Zeninjasloth> thats a weird way to spell whiiplash
[4:04:40] <andresisant> for it to continue
[4:04:40] <%valriot> VEGA IS GOD
[4:04:41] <+AzureGale> Why was Samuel Hayden such a wasted opportunity
[4:04:41] <Jolly_Adventurer> The mysterious voice
[4:04:43] <Monkeyweed21> Now beat the Stadia version for max difficulty
[4:04:44] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt What is next for Doom Guy ? Hell is a cakewalk to him now
[4:04:47] <%necrocannibal2> @PatStaresAt that last boss looked annoying, checkpoint was terrible too
[4:04:48] <Sundaysmiles01> So what next til you wait for RE3?

[4:04:50] <%SaiyanShoto> I wonder what the DLC is gonna be
[4:04:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Josef_Stryker Because TRADITION
[4:04:51] <+rottingpastry> VEGA is a good boy, he won't hurt you
[4:04:51] <%OkamiDude15> we gotta kill SATAN
[4:04:52] <+soullesskin> Gladiator was kool not annoying just kool
[4:04:53] <not_twitter_rowan> Samuel Hayden stole GOD from the angels, the mad lad
[4:04:54] <Them00n> Does Sam Hayden have revolver ocelot syndrome now?
[4:04:54] <+Pookiedaexzile> GOds a Computa
[4:04:54] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> and hayden was samur maykr
[4:04:55] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> Satan will be a rival style fight instead of a huge demon man PLZ
[4:04:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> I blame the cohesiveness of the story on the success of Doom 2016

[4:05:48] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Doom Eternal and 2016 feel like they read the Apocalypse War series
[4:05:48] <$jacob2pop> Hell seems to straight up just be a seperate dimension
[4:05:49] <peachy996> He still hasn't slayed the big guys in charge of hell

[4:05:55] <%Griffin1171> Just reintroduce Mecha-Hitler
[4:05:57] <not_twitter_rowan> VEGA
[4:05:58] <+JackalKing> Doom 2016 was a sequel but also soft remake of Doom 1. Doom Eternal is a soft remake of Doom 2. The next will end with you killing the Mother Demon again and be a soft reboot of Doom 64
[4:05:58] <%Niney_Who> No but Vega is Father
[4:05:58] <ScreamLord> Super God
[4:05:58] <%Valdorick> But VEGA is father.
[4:05:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Or the Dark LORD
[4:05:59] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I think that was VEGA, aka the Father
[4:06:01] <+rottingpastry> I don't want VEGA to be mad at me :(
[4:06:02] <SpaceGuntank> Super-God!
[4:06:02] <RantingRavager> FeelsBadMan Vega
[4:06:02] <Sundaysmiles01> Quake 2 is still a good game

[4:06:05] <%BeatBo_2> Shub Nigurath from Quake? @PatStaresAt

[4:06:08] <%Pyroclase> What monster?
[4:06:10] <Mister_McDerp> Father Cthulu
[4:06:11] <+Lizard0TM> So are we just gonna forget that Doom Slayer was in a tomb/coffin for a long ass time
[4:06:11] <%YourFavoriteShiba> Next game: The slayer will rip and tear and then be done.
[4:06:13] <%Wulfphelz> King Novik also brought up something about bringing heaven’s wrath in the chap 2
[4:06:13] <R3c0n31> Samur, FAther, Dark Lord, Doom Guy Mech suit

[4:07:05] <Tha_Mik> Because
[4:07:05] <%OkamiDude15> it wasnt
[4:07:06] <+Pookiedaexzile> You just got closer
[4:07:06] <not_twitter_rowan> Or rather, Father is a non-carbon based lifeform that made the Makyr
[4:07:07] <R3c0n31> It was not a Mayker, it had Mayker armor tho
[4:07:07] <Maverick2736> teenGRAMZ AND YOU FIGHT SHUB-NIGGURATH teenGRAMZ
[4:07:07] <b_ikki> she was just as big
[4:07:09] <%IncredibleMeh> it looked like a big ass kahn maykr
[4:07:09] <mostundesired> HEH
[4:07:10] <%Niney_Who> It was as big as Khan
[4:07:11] <%BeatBo_2> maybe a dead Khan

[4:07:11] <%PanicSwytch> Doomguy in skyri
[4:07:12] <%luftraumm1> @patstaresat I dont remember what quake was supposed to be, what was it?
[4:07:12] <BeefyQueefer> Why are you 100 times smaller than all the other humans?
[4:07:12] <%superc37> Cuz it was old
[4:07:14] <not_twitter_rowan> Dead Khan
[4:07:16] <$jacob2pop> So Doomguy has to have a pet Shih Tzu in the next game, right?
[4:07:18] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> he was a big boi
[4:07:19] <mobiusnightshade> Icon of Virtue?
[4:07:19] <GOOPAHIPHOP> it was khans husband
[4:07:19] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> She just worked out
[4:07:22] <%StaceMcGate> Big Boi
[4:07:22] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt so did khan in that final fight
[4:07:24] <Mister_McDerp> who knows?
[4:07:25] <%Valdorick> So does the Icon of Sin
[4:07:25] <Them00n> It was the size of the khan makyr
[4:07:26] <%Niney_Who> Maybe it was the Prior Father or Khan
[4:07:27] <CrypticMochi> Hell gets stronger w/o a makyr right?
[4:07:27] <%sheildbear> Cause video game
[4:07:27] <%shootbang_exe> nah dude it was a big maykr
[4:07:27] <librettodude> It was likely the Mother Demon from Doom 64, not a Maykr
[4:07:27] <+Tarage> @PatStaresAt thoughts on the latest episode of Interspecies Reviewers?
[4:07:29] <not_twitter_rowan> It was a dead Khan probably
[4:07:29] <%BeatBo_2> Khan Makyr, a dead one
[4:07:29] <Diana869> so are makers just aliens?
[4:07:30] <+gonzy92> they never used the big mech in the ship
[4:07:30] <Nano_osecond> it was a reaper from the mass effect series- came here to die
[4:07:30] <jenji919> Cuz he a big boi
[4:07:30] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> he was hongry boi
[4:07:30] <R3c0n31> OH the body, that was a Mayker
[4:07:33] <Onmi_Khaos> I dunno, why was the Icon of Sin hundreds of times larger than all the Demons?
[4:07:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> What if Doom 3 is a reimagining of Duke Nukem 3D?
[4:07:34] <rafaelba93> or just do quake next?
[4:07:34] <%valriot> Looked about as big as Khan Makyr
[4:07:35] <+GuyFromRedBank> I'm not crazy. I'm insane.
[4:07:35] <bearking05> it drank its milk
[4:07:36] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt the father was not a Makyr, he just created them
[4:07:38] <Tha_Mik> Shes smol
[4:07:38] <Monkeyweed21> Dude Khan is HUGE
[4:07:38] <SenpaiMD> that was the thing that judges you when you die and go to hell
[4:07:39] <+Neoepochx> Icon of Prayer Kappa
[4:07:39] <Them00n> Pat is wrong again
[4:07:39] <Mister_McDerp> She was big too
[4:07:39] <+ArcanumMBD> Chat is fucking stupid right now
[4:07:41] <Fenlig> I am
[4:07:42] <$vincerocmm> yes
[4:07:42] <%SoFarFetched> hell yeah chat is nuts
[4:07:42] <%dekkitout> Are you?
[4:07:42] <%jiin6> NO you're Crazy
[4:07:42] <$RealThiele> wings

[4:07:42] <+TheBigO75> Chat is high
[4:07:43] <%QuadraticGravity> Are you people insana
[4:07:44] <Neo_Kaiser> Khan had tentacles too
[4:07:44] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I don't think folks have a good idea of size
[4:07:45] <SenpaiMD> it has a codex entry
[4:07:45] <%Maids4lyfe> you people are fucking stupid Pat is right
[4:07:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> The Father != Maker
[4:07:46] <%BeatBo_2> maybe an older Khan Makyr that died
[4:07:47] <nobody12349> 1
[4:07:47] <%OToole42> It should be a 3 way co-op game called ID fest, Bj, Doom Guy and Ranger team up in a MvC stly universe mash up
[4:07:49] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt khan was pretty big pat
[4:07:49] <Saltmeisterr> CRAZY TALK
[4:07:49] <bigbreh> She just opened her wings up guys
[4:07:49] <%PanicSwytch> im not crazy, u r
[4:07:49] <%sheildbear> Yes
[4:07:50] <ataxia72> it the same size as Khan. look how big she is when she towers over Slayer in the first level
[4:07:50] <%QuadraticGravity> Khan was half the size of that fucker
[4:07:50] <black_pariah> it was a bit less than twice her size
[4:07:50] <%Valdorick> Maybe it was the Mykar's attempt at making an Icon to fight hell with.
[4:07:50] <%Piemen99> stupid chat
[4:07:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Kahn was always about 3-4 people tall
[4:07:51] <%bevyrage> just because she grew wings doesn't mean she GOT HUGE
[4:07:53] <GameSoldier_> it was the betrayers son. remember the knife?
[4:07:53] <Tha_Mik> But not that smol
[4:07:53] <Monkeyweed21> She is like 15 feet tall
[4:07:54] <Jolly_Adventurer> Who do I believe NotLikeThis
[4:07:55] <%cylish> they all have tentacles
[4:07:56] <Them00n> The khan makyr was big man
[4:07:57] <%BeatBo_2> and that they grow with time
[4:07:57] <osiris1260> Khan Makyr is about 80 feet tall, you see that in a cutscene
[4:07:58] <+ArcanumMBD> Chat stop being stupid they aren't the same size
[4:07:59] <+darudeampersandstorm> Doom 3's gonna involve time travel, calling it
[4:08:00] <$jacob2pop> @PatStaresAt Pat we're talking about interdimensional aliens, I don't think human rules work with them
[4:08:01] <Zombrocom> I just got her, this conversation is so confusing
[4:08:01] <asurite_warrior> Khan does change size a bit but what is a projection and what isnt is a confusing.
[4:08:01] <Mister_McDerp> WRONG PAT
[4:08:02] <%trustycoyote> Last guy was MUCH bigger than Khan, chat
[4:08:02] <R3c0n31> DOOM : CO-OP
[4:08:02] <Odetokale> she's big, but didn't grow for the fight.
[4:08:02] <%MalekDracarus> Khan was def smaller
[4:08:03] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> this makyr is small, and these makyrs are far away
[4:08:03] <+mechslayer71> Did you see how big Khan Makyr was? Also they had the same tentacles bits and face @patstaresat
[4:08:04] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> pats getting grabby
[4:08:05] <%necrocannibal2> and Pat is the same size as Shaquillo O'Neal
[4:08:06] <televisedrevolting> Pat 2+2=5
[4:08:06] <+rottingpastry> the icon of sin is the betrayer's son
[4:08:06] <%StaceMcGate> Father wasn't a Makyr back
[4:08:10] <+nirvana227> LUL
[4:08:10] <+The_Lunar_Paladin> Never thought I'd see arguing about Doom lore
[4:08:11] <%Pyroclase> What if that's a body for Father?
[4:08:12] <emeraldskrull> pat shirtless woolieTRASH
[4:08:12] <MegaKAOken2> dude look at the cutscene of her death again, she is so much bigger than doomguy
[4:08:12] <+Neoepochx> VEGA was the Father though.
[4:08:13] <librettodude> Khan Maykr was a Mother Demon; In Doom 64 they said there was Two Mother Demons @PatStaresAt
[4:08:14] <%Maids4lyfe> Khan Maykr is nowhere as big as the one in the tank
[4:08:15] <+Kaiser_Loar> It was a dead maker. Maybe the Father
[4:08:16] <Mister_McDerp> she was huge in the cutscene were she died
[4:08:16] <+Jordevio> Samuel Hayden is the hooded figure
[4:08:16] <pillowwasp> Chat is wrong
[4:08:17] <+Infernorabbit> the codex says who the icon is
[4:08:17] <Them00n> 1
[4:08:18] <+Javaa01> You're only the size of her torso
[4:08:18] <%Roundelay11> not as big as the icon
[4:08:19] <%Niney_Who> Pat's right
[4:08:20] <%IncredibleMeh> it wasn't THAT bug
[4:08:21] <+Neoepochx> Samur/Seraphim stole him away.
[4:08:22] <Fenlig> He eats his greens
[4:08:22] <%Ner234> Chat is dumb
[4:08:23] <%Tearonex> Pat's right on this one
[4:08:24] <%Piemen99> 3
[4:08:25] <+Jordevio> Vega is totally the father
[4:08:25] <not_twitter_rowan> But Pat, the Maykrs don't know who their Father is
[4:08:26] <%코코꾸라> PAT IS RIGHT
[4:08:27] <pillowwasp> 3
[4:08:27] <%tusk102> it was not that big
[4:08:27] <Monkeyweed21> Everything bigger than Pat is the same size
[4:08:27] <Thalchampz> I think chat is being dumb
[4:08:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> The head was about the size of Doomguys body.
[4:08:27] <Diana869> @PatStaresAt it was not THAT big

[4:08:28] <enby_shout> pats right

[4:08:39] <Zeninjasloth> chat invokes crazy talk
[4:08:39] <%BeatBo_2> @PatStaresAt maybe it's an older, dead Khan?
[4:08:40] <+AbnormalVoid> jermaOneguy
[4:08:41] <RyanTheRecluse> was probably the next Khan Makyr, but the whole rebirth process got fucked when Father vanished
[4:08:41] <%PanicSwytch> REMEMBER, BECUZ OF PATS SIZE EVERYTHING IS BIG TO HIM
[4:08:42] <andresisant> Maybe the one on the tank was a very big one and then they evolved into little ones
[4:08:42] <mostundesired> HEH
[4:08:43] <%goose_attack_almanac> @PatStaresAt
[4:08:43] <%sheildbear> Yes
[4:08:44] <Jolly_Adventurer> ROLL THE CLIP
[4:08:44] <+ArcanumMBD> does 3 mean chat is wrong? cause if so, 3
[4:08:44] <asurite_warrior> Vega is probably the father.
[4:08:45] <librettodude> @AvoidingTheCoronaVirus exactly; she resurrected the other one
[4:08:46] <CappuccinoGuil> Can't be the Father, though. The Father didn't have a physical body
[4:08:46] <osiris1260> She was about 70% the size of water Makyr
[4:08:47] <BoneofMalkav> LUL
[4:08:47] <%MalekDracarus> pat is right

[4:08:53] <Diana869> @PatStaresAt it was only 3 time bigger than her
[4:08:54] <black_pariah> he was about twice her size
[4:08:55] <%SoFarFetched> IT WAS SO BIG,IT WAS BIGGER THAN PAT'S DICK
[4:08:56] <%thegreenbenis> PAT EVERYTHING IS BIG FOR YOU
[4:08:56] <%Roundelay11> EXAGGERATION
[4:08:56] <R3c0n31> They had the same body tho with different sizes
[4:08:57] <Monkeyweed21> Thats wrong pat
[4:08:58] <srkAres> everything is biog for pat
[4:08:58] <Them00n> Pat is insane
[4:08:58] <%mankeyfigh> Google it
[4:08:58] <+Neoepochx> Pretty sure pat is right, but Vega is Father.
[4:08:59] <%JD_Lars> Gaslight pat
[4:09:00] <%Maids4lyfe> WHOEVER IS SAYING IT WASN'T THAT BIG IS DUMB
[4:09:01] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt kahn seemed to get bigger as her armor came off
[4:09:02] <%dekkitout> Pat, you are kinda short, so it's natural to think it's larger than normal Kappa
[4:09:03] <+conradical> pat, he was big, but not that big
[4:09:04] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Kahn Mayker wasn't even the size of the torso
[4:09:04] <Neo_Kaiser> The Icon of Sin was the same size
[4:09:05] <Tha_Mik> Okay chat now we are exaggerating
[4:09:05] <%ElkRiverDog> Original makyr maybe?
[4:09:06] <boomstickery> it was massive
[4:09:06] <peachy996> My only guess is that it was a Makyr in waiting. no real answers on that guy
[4:09:07] <dking0000> The Maykr in the tank is the exact same model as the Khan Maykr
[4:09:09] <jorniev> what wasnt big
[4:09:10] <%BeatBo_2> 3x as old?
[4:09:12] <+Neoepochx> And I think the Mysterious voice was either Father or Dark Lord
[4:09:12] <Fenlig> Maybe it was a male
[4:09:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> [CRAZY TALK ACT 2]
[4:09:14] <iosephe> Sexual dimorphism
[4:09:15] <ringabal> You guys and you sizes

[4:09:17] <osiris1260> Pat, your super wrong
[4:09:18] <+ArcanumMBD> @dking0000 lmao you couldnt be more wrong
[4:09:19] <j0ustar> Pat they just want to hear you're angry pat shrieks
[4:09:19] <boomstickery> it was triggering peoples thlassaphobia
[4:09:19] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Icon was WAY huge
[4:09:19] <%BeatBo_2> Icon of Sin is Kaiju
[4:09:21] <Mister_McDerp> Pat everything is big to you
[4:09:21] <+LandOfTheWay> PAT YOU JUST SAID ITS HEAD WAS THE SIZE OF A BUS
[4:09:21] <R3c0n31> Icon was Titan level
[4:09:21] <mostundesired> She was big, but that Makyr was fuckhuge.
[4:09:21] <Onmi_Khaos> JUST CAUSE IT'S THE SAME MODEL DOESN'T MAKE IT THE SAME SIZE
[4:09:22] <%superc37> PAT THE TENTACLES WERE APART OF ITS BODY
[4:09:24] <asurite_warrior> Well they are tentacle aliens who knows how big they get.
[4:09:26] <%Agami23> icon of sin is kinda hot though, not gonna lie
[4:09:26] <TeaJayGee> it was huge
[4:09:27] <+Cavumentum> It was VEGA, obviously
[4:09:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> I think that was Vega
[4:09:30] <%Roundelay11> then who was it?
[4:09:31] <Them00n> Pat only thinks this because he is short
[4:09:32] <+EmotionalFatGuy> Vader would
[4:09:33] <Jolly_Adventurer> Dark Lord would go YEYEYEYE
[4:09:33] <+Jordevio> Hayden is the mastermind of it all
[4:09:34] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt pat the tentacles were its legs
[4:09:34] <+conradical> just go back to the room with cheats or easy mode
[4:09:34] <%dekkitout> Now if it were 4.74 times the size, then it'd be HUGE
[4:09:35] <GOOPAHIPHOP> it was the guy in the tub
[4:09:35] <rafaelba93> it was bigger then ger for sure
[4:09:36] <%redrins> then would the icon of sin be 99% lower leg? LUL
[4:09:37] <+nirvana227> dark vader said no MiniK
[4:09:37] <Diana869> y would dark lord care
[4:09:37] <+Jordevio> His tech is alien
[4:09:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> Father Vega
[4:09:39] <Yummy_Nukes> VEGA isn't the Father, he's a copy of the Father
[4:09:39] <Monkeyweed21> Anything Bigger than Pat is impossible size

[4:16:19] <NeroInfinite> Wowee
[4:16:20] <%Louie_Salmon> @doc_ock_rokc Nah, VEGA made them, and they helped doomguy use his main PC
[4:16:22] <%derekwst3> so what is going to be tommorrow stream since you beat this?
[4:16:22] <+Neoepochx> It is a line trigger
[4:16:25] <+GuyFromRedBank> Okay. It's confirmed. I can't play Quake. It gives me lots of headaches. lol
[4:16:25] <+Neoepochx> At the start of the room.

[4:17:27] <Xhog1> The bosses are a lot harder in Brutal Doom
[4:17:33] <+AzureGale> That means we could put in Ultimate Doom?
[4:17:34] <Neo_Kaiser> IDKFA
[4:17:35] <+Neoepochx> @PatStaresAt It is a line trigger.
[4:17:37] <%trustycoyote> Little shit like being able to play WADS make the game even better

[4:22:48] <+soullesskin> What’s for tomorrow
[4:23:01] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Tomorrow Doom DLC drops I think
[4:23:13] <Buzzard42> @King_Wolf_Rigger wait for real
[4:23:16] <Reizie_Etherealm> That's pretty early
[4:23:21] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I might be WRONG tho
[4:23:34] <%tusk102> @UnfilteredComic "i gotta get back to Nintendo(tm)'s Animal Crossing: New Horizons on my Nintendo Switch(C)"
[4:23:43] <BearGoo> way too early for dlc to drop
[4:23:51] <%SpicyVibration> Back to RE
[4:23:56] <YakumoYomi> If Doom DLC doesn't drop tomorrow, it's clearly @King_Wolf_Rigger 's fault!
[4:23:59] <Reizie_Etherealm> RE REV 2?
[4:23:59] <%OkamiDude15> back to re6
[4:24:02] <bigbreh> I dont see anything on the DOOM twitter
[4:24:11] <BearGoo> how dare you king
[4:24:25] <%tusk102> He's not gonna start REV2, he'll never get it done before RE3R comes out
[4:24:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> tomorrow, Pat Stares At Your Mom
[4:24:36] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Yeah, it's not tomorrow, sorry
[4:24:49] <+soullesskin> Any thoughts on what pat is going to stream tomorrow?
[4:24:57] <Buzzard42> apparently the DLCs will both be about bridging the gap between Doom 2016 and Eternal
[4:24:58] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I thought I heard that from someone, and I hoped too hard
[4:25:04] <YakumoYomi> Damnit, King!
[4:25:09] <Neo_Kaiser> What's Pats opinion on Persona 5 getting street broken a week early from EB Games in Australia?
[4:25:15] <Reizie_Etherealm> What else is on the menu other than animal crossing?
[4:25:24] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Nioh 2
[4:25:29] <%tusk102> @rumtumtugnutz is your name a reference to Tum Tum Tugger from Cats or is that just a coincidence
[4:25:36] <Mige_> hopefully ori 2
[4:25:36] <%tusk102> rum*
[4:25:46] <%derekwst3> Re7 or which ever Re is next
[4:25:47] <$lotharrio> Control's DLC is coming out... I guess today.
[4:25:53] <Reizie_Etherealm> I'm not sure if Pat is too keen on Nioh 2, Ori sounds pretty good tho

[4:27:36] <%ShichiNoBushi> 38 hours, no pauses.
[4:27:37] <%Pyroclase> DLCs for games like this tend to get waaaaay less coverage

[4:32:41] <%SaiyanShoto> I definitely don't trust him being in the fortress of doom

[4:34:31] <DXLelouch24> Their savin Mech for Doom 5
[4:34:36] <+conradical> if every Maykr has to follow the will of the Khan Maykr, then how come Samur/Samuel could do what he wanted and steal the Father?
[4:34:46] <peachy996> oh please do not put Sam inside a Mech
[4:34:49] <%Aleate> Same. And it controls EXACTLY the same as on feet, but Mech, and Icon on Sin is a normal sized enemy ruuLove
