[0:00:00] <gustavozxd> the game IS free so honestly the chances of that happening are sadly high
[0:00:01] <hakumaribo> dude you are gonna want to turn off symbol art chat too, theres straight up porn being posted with those, including loli porn... dudes are sick...
[0:00:04] <Melchior_the_Wise> Hentai Symbol art POG

[0:00:23] <B0reas> @hakumaribo symbol art has been disabled for public chat since at least two weeks ago.
[0:00:23] <%SuckerPunchSyd> On segas part
[0:00:24] <Melchior_the_Wise> MMOs are great
[0:00:26] <%hamborgini> not really
[0:00:27] <Papa_Bearman> Oh, yeah, go into Options and turn Symbol Chat completely off.
[0:00:27] <Omega_acceptile> Did you turn off messages?
[0:00:28] <+sonofthedeepsouth> THEY ARE GREAT
[0:00:31] <%depressed_skeleton> I'm Desk
[0:00:32] <+zylomarkiii> Symbol art is off by default now.
[0:00:34] <OmegaWeltall> oh the Hentai Symbol chats have been in the game sinc base PSO2 LUL
[0:00:35] <28moogles> Yep
[0:00:35] <+Kduff89> Oh god pls make sure symbol art is off
[0:00:35] <ne0bunny> @hakumaribo symbol arts are currently off in area chat on global
[0:00:37] <+ThomasOfTroy> Sega should probably add some chat filters
[0:00:37] <%majorpeppy> MMOs weren't a mistake at all
[0:00:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt YES, totally turn off SYMBOL ART, porn will be incoming
[0:00:39] <Papa_Bearman> Oh.
[0:00:41] <Truxton_II> @hakumaribo Sega disabled Symbol Arts in public chat
[0:00:42] <Afterman_> oh nice
[0:00:44] <Siconia> I love interacting with complete strangers on the internet
[0:00:47] <%TheWinged7> so, what do yo think the time to raunchy symbol art on screen will be?
[0:00:50] <AzureHalo> That was probs someone who made a scapegoat account, just to yell all that, and not get their main purged. It happens.
[0:00:50] <%maenos2> THAT'S a haro
[0:00:53] <Afterman_> @ShinobiPhoenix its off by default apparently
[0:00:53] <Sydin18> Like no1 can can use symbol art, you can still see them if you party
[0:00:55] <%PocketBearIllustrator> sorry you had to deal with that, @patstaresat
[0:00:56] <+Kduff89> THANK GOD
[0:00:56] <OmegaWeltall> oh ok thank god LUL
[0:00:58] <%GalacticaPhanto> Sega really doesn't give a shit about filtering do they?
[0:00:58] <chiinachan> @shinobiphoenix i thought that was done by sega
[0:00:59] <rept7> And THIS MMO was the one I ended up actually liking.
[0:01:02] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I do like your robot dude
[0:01:04] <%TalisKanju> Isn't there maintenance today?
[0:01:09] <semachie> n pass + strikes again
[0:01:09] <Papa_Bearman> The RMT fuckers are the WORST.
[0:01:13] <Melchior_the_Wise> i=frames baby
[0:01:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> when Max streamed, there was SO much immediate porn
[0:01:17] <%Axellogic> Tweaker has proper chat censors
[0:01:20] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh my god you have a little hat
[0:01:23] <B0reas> @TalisKanju in about two hours or so
[0:01:24] <Afterman_> mmm sexy punch dodges
[0:01:25] <Papa_Bearman> The RMT bots were epidemic in PSO2 original last year.
[0:01:29] <Laecerelius> Yeah this game is pretty big on parrys
[0:01:32] <DrkJP520> I like your little robot buddy
[0:01:39] <%Tman451> Tman451 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 50 months! 
[0:01:39] <+Macua2> They were like LEGION
[0:01:43] <Truxton_II> @TalisKanju There is but it doesn't start until the scheduled end of this stream anyway
[0:01:45] <%BinaryFireball> at first I did not like the hat but now I do
[0:01:50] <AzureHalo> Funny thing is that is usually censored? So, that was odd.
[0:01:52] <%depressed_skeleton> more like bozi deez nutz
[0:01:52] <Afterman_> @Laecerelius so the knuckles combat is good? i remember it being kind of meh in original pso2
[0:01:56] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Hell yeah
[0:01:57] <jerobees> @Papa_Bearman I blocked and reported so many of those it was so bad
[0:01:59] <HellboundHeartless> Wait can you Dempsey Roll in this game?
[0:02:05] <Laecerelius> It's really good in this one
[0:02:07] <Papa_Bearman> Me, too.
[0:02:10] <chiinachan> they dont repersent our community
[0:02:19] <%GalacticaPhanto> The fact that I've been e
[0:02:20] <28moogles> So is this PSO2 A Realm Reborn or is this a separate thing?
[0:02:24] <ape_hawk> oh, i see pat is playing Better Anthem
[0:02:26] <Laecerelius> All of Fighter's weapons are fun
[0:02:27] <Papa_Bearman> The yellow symbol on the right of your hotbar is called Reversigne, which revives downed allies.  Those are rarer.
[0:02:27] <GilliamYaeger> @Afterman_ Knuckles are legit the most fun weapon in the game at the moment
[0:02:31] <Afterman_> @Laecerelius how is the game? I remember hearing ppl say it had some lack of lategame content, has that been addressed?
[0:02:33] <Truxton_II> @Afterman_ Knuckles are in a good spot in NGS right now. Very counter attack heavy, though. I miss Heartless Impact, though
[0:02:34] <+ninebreaker6> !PSO2
[0:02:35] <@Moobot> @ninebreaker6 Hey everyone, I'm glad to be playing PSO2 NGS tonight and thanks again to Sega for sponsoring me! If you like what you see, check the game out using this link! https://bit.ly/PatStaresAt
[0:02:35] <%GalacticaPhanto> been hearing that this happens to often really kills my interest in this
[0:02:40] <Papa_Bearman> Yeah, Anthem got so much better.
[0:02:41] <Afterman_> @GilliamYaeger guess im downloading this then...
[0:02:46] <+zylomarkiii> You know your tropes, Pat.
[0:02:51] <Laecerelius> It's fun but yeah there's not a lot of content right now
[0:02:52] <Melchior_the_Wise> pat just reading the script
[0:02:58] <%TalisKanju> @28moogles It's more like FFXIV 1.0
[0:03:01] <Melchior_the_Wise> The scripts is all over the floor
[0:03:01] <%Larry_Q> WHAT!? NOOOOO...
[0:03:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @28moogles not quite, it's just PSO2 is literally about to be 10 years old, so they had to update it at some point
[0:03:09] <Papa_Bearman> Primm is babby.
[0:03:19] <gslayer14> TOWN EXPLOSION IMMINENT
[0:03:21] <semachie> equip armour
[0:03:27] <%Monkeyweed21> This town is sustained entirely by blue Gladio's lats
[0:03:30] <28moogles> @TalisKanju I meant in it's relation to the previous PSO2.
[0:03:32] <GMDeynger> @gslayer14 Sssh
[0:03:33] <%depressed_skeleton> swim stupid. :)
[0:03:34] <DrkJP520> What's that over there? Is that the script?
[0:03:34] <%Jekado> At least pat won't have to deal with the weird BP stuff later game
[0:03:37] <LatisRox> PSO2:NGS global has very little content right now, and a bogged market in every ship for most of the nice cosmetics. Free to play ppl can't sell things on the auction house. Try the game but go with low expectations
[0:03:37] <garbageheaphound> MAN INA SAID THE SAME THING
[0:03:37] <Melchior_the_Wise> Hub town is just about same size
[0:03:42] <JowiJoestar> 9 morons, 9 hours, 9 doors
[0:03:43] <Sydin18> @28moogles Its a separate game, but you can freely move your character between new geney and base
[0:03:43] <Papa_Bearman> Guys, you're being silly, this town is going to be just fine.
[0:03:50] <ZaCrimsonDragon> isnt the town bigger than the actually hub?
[0:03:51] <RadAtVideoGames> @28moogles it's like Sonic 3&k
[0:03:51] <Papa_Bearman> Dude, it's just WAKKA-CROSS-SEYMOUR!!
[0:03:55] <%blistexthief> Yeah, but he's hot tho
[0:03:56] <%cvp5127> Kreygasm
[0:03:57] <%Bluwizard21> he looks like the dude from tekken
[0:03:57] <Laecerelius> It's fine
[0:04:01] <+fetrigon> fuck it
[0:04:02] <+Kduff89> He's just Zangeif
[0:04:03] <+BigBruthaThunda> all he needs
[0:04:03] <+Macua2> Photon armor
[0:04:05] <$lotharrio> He's also highlighting his dick area as a target.
[0:04:06] <+sonofthedeepsouth> GACHIBASS
[0:04:06] <%Zeif00> He's hot tho
[0:04:06] <Psyramics> his rippling muscles are all the armor he needs
[0:04:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and that's all he needs
[0:04:06] <Omega_acceptile> Sega should really protect new accounts for a while.
[0:04:07] <%depressed_skeleton> All the important things are in his legs.
[0:04:09] <%RetroCop87> he's thrusting his dick at you 24/7
[0:04:09] <+Macua2> yes it's an excuse
[0:04:10] <%SuckerPunchSyd> What do you mean its great
[0:04:10] <+sonofthedeepsouth> PROTECT DICK
[0:04:11] <Laecerelius> He's got the male version of titty armor, he has great stats in it!
[0:04:14] <+Macua2> but WOULD HIS MUSCLES LIE?!
[0:04:15] <%Jekado> @LatisRox I heard the inflation is pretty bad.  You can BUY paid gear on the market but its a lot of mesate to do so.
[0:04:16] <%Bluwizard21> he looks like jecht
[0:04:18] <kitsunexans> female armor for him
[0:04:18] <%Axellogic> Pat and his butt fists
[0:04:19] <wolfen091> hes a necromorph!  protect those limbs
[0:04:22] <%GarbageNirvana> It's Cyber-Jecht
[0:04:23] <%SuckerPunchSyd> He looks hot in it its fine
[0:04:24] <Siconia> Who needs armour when your dick is ENORMOUS
[0:04:25] <AzureHalo> The man is just the embodiment of FF10 Design.
[0:04:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> he only needs MUSCLES AND JUSTICE
[0:04:28] <B0reas> @LatisRox agree on all points and I even like the game. Big problems with it.
[0:04:29] <+Kduff89> Fuck armor when you have muscles that can break katanas
[0:04:32] <%depressed_skeleton> Did the music just cut itself off?
[0:04:38] <C24U> @PatStaresAt like Wakka and Jecht from FFX had a baby together
[0:04:41] <$lotharrio> Yeah all he has to protect his junk are two belts and leather pants.
[0:04:43] <ZaCrimsonDragon> He knows
[0:04:44] <Melchior_the_Wise> IT IS
[0:04:45] <hairtoday> his tattoo is spandex
[0:04:45] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:04:46] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @latisrox I'm willing to give this ago, but honestly? it's hard to get into another MMO when you're already dedicated to one (FFXIV for me.)
[0:04:46] <terrible35> he is LUL
[0:04:46] <+fetrigon> ye
[0:04:48] <gslayer14> LUL
[0:04:48] <%depressed_skeleton> shut up pat, hes not wearing falsies

[0:04:56] <%Axellogic> tatoos have a glossyness slider
[0:04:59] <dekkitout> Or it's a skin graft
[0:05:00] <Sydin18> IT IS IN THEORY
[0:05:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> no, you can put gloss on your tattoos in the character creator
[0:05:02] <$Ziegsy> Its a transfer tattoo
[0:05:03] <Papa_Bearman> Yeah, he's a Wakka/Seymour/Jecht homunculus.
[0:05:06] <AzureHalo> Nah, it's a future Tattoo.
[0:05:06] <gustavozxd> you irl
[0:05:06] <$spleekle> LUL like those "tattoo shirts"

[0:05:20] <Siconia> By morning this place will be burnt to the ground
[0:05:20] <%MidnightBurst12> he oils up daily

[0:09:04] <shirokami7> If you're wondering. The ones doing this to streamers are Associates. An Alliance in SHIP 2 full of racist/homophobes/transphobes people who are always behind these attacks.

[0:09:23] <%TheYellowcouch> don't remind us
[0:09:24] <+Pharmakokinetic> I really thought PSO2 was another classic style MMO this looks fun tho
[0:09:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you should try nioh 2 then as well
[0:09:30] <Big_Dream> Monk feel good to play
[0:09:37] <ne0bunny> it hurts pat, but its true
[0:09:38] <Big_Dream> yes
[0:09:40] <%Axellogic> HE uses PArtizan PAt
[0:09:40] <BYAKURENLOVER763> its hunter
[0:09:42] <chiinachan> yeah
[0:09:42] <Melchior_the_Wise> it should be Hunter I think
[0:09:42] <+jyeowa> yup, that's a partisan
[0:09:46] <+shrapnull> Garoa looks like he's just playing hunter
[0:09:46] <Papa_Bearman> Yeah, this game is fun.  You get into the ritual of it pretty easily, though.

[0:09:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> rip firsttown
[0:09:53] <HawkHollywood> yes hunter uses Sword spear and wired lance
[0:09:53] <Truxton_II> I think it's supposed to be a partisan
[0:09:53] <%Axellogic> Hunter: PArtisan
[0:09:55] <B0reas> Might be sword or polearm, axe isn't its own weapon class though
[0:09:55] <%depressed_skeleton> Nah you can fix it
[0:09:55] <Melchior_the_Wise> Hunter = Tank class
[0:09:56] <+croutonian> I've been leveling monk to 80... its been rough

[0:18:09] <+Basilias_Maximus> They're like loadouts you talk to a guy to switch between.

[0:19:16] <gustavozxd> that's a villain as fuck name
[0:19:18] <%solracc25> That town does not exist anymore
[0:19:18] <Siconia> Crawford is such an evil guy name
[0:19:18] <2DSuperiority> are those big boob accessories expensive as fuck?
[0:19:22] <Dead_Trickster> WERE from Alio town, that place is charcoal now.

[0:20:02] <+HefestoForges> the shilling begins
[0:20:03] <+cascadepersona> @2DSuperiority You have to do their Gacha pull ticket system to get it, so it is kinda random. It's also resizeable to almost any size (lol)
[0:20:04] <%42nfl19> oh WOW, tell me MORE
[0:20:05] <fIashman92> It's the ship from Chrono Trigger
[0:20:06] <%Jekado> yeah its open world

[0:20:16] <C24U> You load into missions in PSO2 yes
[0:20:16] <Psyramics> PSO2 OG is mission based
[0:20:16] <+HefestoForges> pso2 original has all the loading screens
[0:20:18] <gustavozxd> assumption?
[0:20:19] <GilliamYaeger> PSO2 was SUPER instanced
[0:20:20] <%Axellogic> oh boy does PSO2 have loading screens alright
[0:20:27] <kitsunexans> og was instance based
[0:20:28] <Papa_Bearman> The world itself is pretty small right now.
[0:20:31] <%Monkeyweed21> pso2 had tons of loading screms
[0:20:32] <GilliamYaeger> A bit less instanced than old school monhun
[0:20:38] <Melchior_the_Wise> Every area was instanced
[0:20:40] <$LegendGHT> @patstaresat It's been 30 minutes since you said I'll be at Central in 35
[0:20:41] <Siconia> There's no open areas in Pso2
[0:20:44] <%Jekado> yeah its very tiny but level 20 is the cap
[0:20:48] <%depressed_skeleton> oh no
[0:20:50] <B0reas> open world is a bit more of a hassle since there's little in it right now though

[0:20:55] <%pokefan9956> psaGib psaGib psaGib
[0:20:56] <Beheziel> Is the a Segata Sashiro npc in this game that kicks your ass for not playing more?
[0:20:56] <gustavozxd> the map in this game rn is like one Xenoblade X region

[0:21:20] <B0reas> He looks like he's 12
[0:21:20] <%capnbeefs> The drip is real, but the face is butter
[0:21:23] <BlueLunecy> Seeing this guy just makes me miss Xiao

[0:21:35] <Laecerelius> Hey, he's a VERY advanced 13 year old
[0:21:36] <Papa_Bearman> There's a bunch in PSO2 original that I didn't bother with.  I still can't find anyone to do the Challenge block with.

[0:23:23] <%capnbeefs> We did literally nothing
[0:23:26] <Laecerelius> Yeah, Dark Falz is kinda the big enemy of all Phantasy Star that keeps coming back over and over again

[0:23:42] <%solracc25> We ran from it, that's it
[0:23:43] <Papa_Bearman> You know what would be great?  If the next section of the game is released and it's revealed that it's NOT Dark Falz, but it's just some guy named Greg that already defeated Dark Falz and absorbed his powers.
[0:23:45] <BlueLunecy> I'd like to see this one do better than the base PSO2 Dark Falz
[0:23:46] <%PocketBearIllustrator> take care, chat!
[0:23:50] <dekkitout> Insulated camp
[0:23:51] <C24U> I thought that said "What will you do Moron?

[0:24:54] <Dead_Trickster> I can't believe I didn't notice till now that Pat's robo balls are jingling around on top of his head.
[0:24:54] <%HairballCT> just an outlet and a type-C charging cable
[0:24:57] <kitsunexans> pat needs a Borg charging pod
[0:24:59] <%Ipsenscastle> @Ziegsy the concept of boob socks is new to me, but I think the answer is probably yes
[0:24:59] <Melchior_the_Wise> WHAT ROOM?
[0:25:00] <muXPerience> I've prepared <One> Rooms
[0:25:02] <%GarbageNirvana> Ran is actually a robot, right
[0:25:03] <SilverFaustX> thx basket man
[0:25:04] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @ziegsy its juts suction cupped on

[0:38:50] <Papa_Bearman> Well, day/night in real life isn't even, either.
[0:38:50] <+Shin_Doom_Bot> Morning and Sunset
[0:38:53] <Laecerelius> Holy shit early Warframe had worthless waypoints
[0:38:56] <Melchior_the_Wise> Ryuker devices are teleport checkpoints

[0:39:27] <Sydin18> You can use the Ryuker device in central city to teleport to base pso2
[0:39:27] <+xerotwo> D:
[0:39:27] <Laecerelius> You did it, Pat!

[0:43:41] <+thelonechris> "I would like to get my ass ruined."
[0:43:44] <$Ziegsy> its tickling my left earhole
[0:43:45] <Laecerelius> They can spawn in various areas around the zone if it's raining
[0:43:49] <%Jekado> since Gigas scale with number of players
[0:43:51] <%TalisKanju> @gustavozxd Correct
[0:43:52] <ComplexZeru> 10pm est
[0:43:54] <wolfen091> "id like to get my ass ruined" -pat boivin  2021
[0:43:54] <+zylomarkiii> 7 PM PST.
[0:43:56] <$realm_forge> Your battle power is not gigantix
[0:43:58] <+Shin_Doom_Bot> Pat gonna hate this
[0:44:07] <+zodiark26> this one sucks as fighter
[0:44:27] <wolfen091> fist it pat
[0:44:33] <Laecerelius> Yeah it sucks for melee
[0:44:42] <%megadblitz> damn 1 and a half hours? I got some time then
[0:44:46] <+nictron90> You should be able to lock onto the glowy weakpoint
[0:44:50] <%Jekado> yeah
[0:44:52] <+zylomarkiii> It's rough for melee.
[0:44:56] <%Jekado> he is
[0:44:56] <jerobees> This is why you should always choose GUN
[0:45:03] <Afterman_> tight ass angle
[0:45:04] <%Jekado> its why i use twin guns
[0:45:04] <+zylomarkiii> You only just need to clear it.
[0:45:06] <lotharaxe> Melee in this game is rough in general really
[0:45:07] <tattleworm> laughs in twin dagger
[0:45:14] <Sydin18> Switch to twin daggers, it attaches abit better
[0:45:17] <JowiJoestar> no cool shinsho for you
[0:45:19] <%Monkeyweed21> this was super easy as Gunner lol
[0:45:27] <Laecerelius> He doesn't have twin daggers yet
[0:45:29] <+Shin_Doom_Bot> it's really an HitBox issue
[0:45:33] <ConeOTragedy> 55 seconds FamilyMan
[0:45:33] <+Ripper_Roo25> lol
[0:45:33] <gustavozxd> are there really just like 3 PAs per weapon or did I miss something?
[0:45:40] <Melchior_the_Wise> you get revives bro
[0:45:44] <B0reas> gotta dodge/parry when they attack
[0:45:46] <wolfen091> melee has always been rough in any pso game, since back in the dreamcast days
[0:45:53] <%MidnightBurst12> ded
[0:45:56] <Melchior_the_Wise> @gustavozxd 5-6 usually.
[0:45:59] <+Shin_Doom_Bot> Time ya RB
[0:46:09] <FrostedZaibatsu> These are always a hassle. the should make the hit box bigger on smaller enemies
[0:46:17] <%megadblitz> that's 1 asscheek destroyed
[0:46:19] <Melchior_the_Wise> the serious boi is the ninja one
[0:46:21] <$Ziegsy> DOLL?!
[0:46:24] <+HefestoForges> remember to dodge
[0:46:26] <Omega_acceptile> Your Weapon Action RB is a counter.
[0:46:31] <%Axellogic> Difficulty in NGS requires a bit more attention
[0:46:31] <malcobraaklynny> DOLLS????
[0:46:32] <$Ziegsy> PAIGE MUST BE DESTROYED. DOLL!!!
[0:46:34] <+nictron90> CROSS COUNTER
[0:46:35] <B0reas> good counter at the end, right bumper is for that
[0:46:38] <wolfen091> dear hunter
[0:46:40] <%Jekado> its fine
[0:46:42] <fIashman92> Absolutely perfect
[0:46:47] <Laecerelius> Hey, you didn't fuck up 5 times so it's fine
[0:46:47] <Sydin18> 3 outta 5 ;>
[0:46:48] <%Jekado> as long as you beat it you get the skill point
[0:46:49] <%JoshManVGH> 3 Star perfection
[0:46:50] <+jyeowa> the ninja DOLL is like a vergil fight, so fun
[0:46:52] <%Jekado> the options are pointless
[0:47:12] <%pokefan9956> is this Xenoblade Kappa
[0:47:15] <Melchior_the_Wise> teleport
[0:47:16] <%Jekado> storm ends after 3 mins usually
[0:47:19] <%HotSauceFiend> Is this another MMORPG? I
[0:47:20] <Siconia> Where's the class that does all the sick kickboxing moves and shit
[0:47:26] <%Axellogic> The zone is big and only one appears
[0:47:28] <C24U> A lvl 1 Patt
[0:47:32] <+Shin_Doom_Bot> it would pop up at random or just go where everyone is at while the rain is up
[0:47:33] <%Axellogic> He's not crazy big
[0:47:33] <%Jekado> circle around the city he's usually around there
[0:47:33] <Laecerelius> I'm sure there will be titles for getting 5 stars on them once they're in the game
[0:47:33] <+jyeowa> there's a chance you might not see it cause you're still doing tutorial stuff
[0:47:35] <Sydin18> Follow the heartbeat
[0:47:47] <gustavozxd> @siconia weapon isn't out yet, neither is the katana

[0:48:45] <Melchior_the_Wise> Fighter/Hunter or Fighter/Force big recommend
[0:48:53] <%Axellogic> Class points are even based on how many cocoons you have done
[0:48:56] <BlueLunecy> Don't fuck this one up you can't reset skills easily
[0:48:56] <RedSqurrl> !PSO2

[0:49:58] <gustavozxd> uh oh racial tirades incoming

[0:50:10] <xflashfirex> oh hey, hes finally playing it
[0:50:11] <@thenefftw> thenefftw subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! Two whole years of subbing doesn't seem real to me, but I'm always glad to have supported you all that time, Pat. Now to distract myself so the last two years don't set in.
[0:50:11] <+nictron90> in that window at least
[0:50:17] <Melchior_the_Wise> she got orange clothes tho
[0:50:22] <+HefestoForges> just the clothes
[0:50:24] <+Shin_Doom_Bot> they are named by armor
[0:50:25] <kitsunexans> fighter has 2 more weapon types
[0:50:26] <%pokefan9956> oranje disco dancer?
[0:50:27] <+valheart35> close enough

[0:50:31] <Dunmarkh> and a tiny hat
[0:50:37] <%MidnightBurst12> booo
[0:50:38] <Laecerelius> you get meat from them
[0:50:38] <gustavozxd> she was born with those clothes on, that's why she's called that
[0:50:40] <%Jekado> they are tame
[0:50:53] <ZaCrimsonDragon> the T in TAMES stands for TAMES
[0:50:56] <+zylomarkiii> Good old regular oil.
[0:51:00] <Melchior_the_Wise> yeah, kill all the meat
[0:51:01] <%TalisKanju> CASTS in PSO2 are more like cyborgs
[0:51:05] <%AzureGale> Pat s a robot lady, what?
[0:51:07] <%Jekado> Tames Ames
[0:51:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> go get that schmeat Pat
[0:51:11] <neptious> DOLLS stands for STRANDOOLS

[0:51:16] <%Monkeyweed21> tame animal meaty eats
[0:51:20] <%king_wragles> It's a fact Sega doesn't want us to know!
[0:51:24] <$lotharrio> It feels true, which is most important.
[0:51:26] <+HefestoForges> casts are more robocop than gundam
[0:51:30] <Melchior_the_Wise> Casts are just ADmechs but more anime
[0:51:40] <ComplexZeru> gustavozxd was already racial tirades earlier thankfully gms are watching & they dealt with em
[0:51:40] <kitsunexans> I think pso1 casts were fully robots
[0:51:48] <+nictron90> CASTS were people whose photons were too strong and were destroying their body, so they were like 'You are too rad to die  we will turn you into a robot'
[0:51:50] <gslayer14> YEAH, FIST THOSE DEER!
[0:51:57] <+zodiark26> it was a ghost

[0:57:29] <%megadblitz> OH NO
[0:57:43] <%Jekado> i mean there isn't much content in the game currently
[0:57:50] <tattleworm> that's your inventory
[0:57:52] <+HefestoForges> these are your items LUL
[0:57:52] <%JoshManVGH> Chat is a curse apparently. Does the UI reset after every dialog?
[0:57:54] <+shrapnull> combine fists into fists to make superfists
[0:57:56] <%Jekado> you can stack up to 5
[0:58:03] <fIashman92> Your feeding items to a target item
[0:58:04] <%Jekado> 5 at one time only
[0:58:05] <sweetkek> you feed it
[0:58:07] <kiba_miyata> Can only do 5 at a time.
[0:58:09] <jerobees> That's what you have
[0:58:10] <gustavozxd> it actually takes a bit to unlock everything, they take you through it at a nice pace
[0:58:15] <Sydin18> 5 at a time
[0:58:16] <Laecerelius> you feed items into your item to make it stronger
[0:58:18] <jerobees> You're selecting your whole inventory
[0:58:19] <+zylomarkiii> You have a base item and use fodder items to increase its XP.
[0:58:22] <+HefestoForges> no
[0:58:23] <%Jekado> it can be any weapon
[0:58:29] <%Jekado> doesn't have to be a duplicate
[0:58:30] <+Huderga> you feed items to what you have equip to make em better @PatStaresAt
[0:58:33] <+shrapnull> it can be any but dupes give more level exp
[0:58:34] <+HefestoForges> doesn't need to be duplicate
[0:58:35] <Psyramics> its not duplicates, its any weapon
[0:58:36] <Sydin18> You can get grinders from green boxes
[0:58:37] <%Jekado> you can use any weapon to grind another weapon
[0:58:40] <+zodiark26> feeding fists with fists
[0:58:42] <Laecerelius> She gave you 10
[0:58:47] <VixyNyan> sell them
[0:58:47] <%Jekado> Silver sword gives the most EX
[0:58:47] <kiba_miyata> Not just duplicates. You can add any weapon to it, but it can only be 5 weapons at a time.
[0:58:48] <Laecerelius> duplicates are worth more
[0:58:52] <Melchior_the_Wise> @PatStaresAt pick the weapon you want, and then it will show you the other items to upgrade and you do up to 5, weapons that are similar give more level to the weapon
[0:58:56] <tattleworm> duplicates give bonus exp so it's preferable but ehh
[0:58:58] <TerrifyingRei_05> but next tier up cost more to fuse
[0:59:04] <+HefestoForges> why is she not Greno
[0:59:05] <lbrownthedestroyer> Well Well look who is playing PSO in 2021.
[0:59:05] <sweetkek> duplicate is ideal as it gives more points
[0:59:11] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you can also buy twin daggers and a dualsaber
[0:59:13] <Sydin18> Save them silver swords and gold swords, they bonus exp for enchancments
[0:59:13] <Laecerelius> Yeah silver swords are how tyou level the fuck outta your weapons.  Wish there was an armor equivalent.
[0:59:14] <gustavozxd> xingobob's at it again
[0:59:17] <VixyNyan> what ship/block is this? CorgiDerp

[1:19:39] <Papa_Bearman> It's not Dark Falz, it's Greg.
[1:19:40] <Melchior_the_Wise> only 37 years later, and its still dark falz
[1:19:41] <MacMog> @goose_attack_almanac For… Shatnerstyle … dramaticeffect
[1:19:43] <%AzureGale> Tutorial Island was destroyed by the Reapers
[1:19:45] <Sydin18> Dark Falz [Rhombus]
[1:19:49] <NeroInfinite> It's ALWAYS dark falz
[1:19:54] <ReiRyghts1> EVERY GAME ITS THE FALZ
[1:19:54] <TheNewZealandStory> is this star ocean 4
[1:19:57] <GeltonZ> It's ALWAYS Dark Falz. Like last game they pretty much revealed Dark Falz is an entire race.
[1:20:08] <%Jekado> You have to do the tutorial anyways to unlock anything
[1:20:09] <GuyverTypeL> Dark Force sounds cooler thooo
[1:20:09] <MichelangeloStark> @mechanicalbias the installation problem still exists on steam and windows store. the fix was to uninsrall and reinstall BUT users have created custom installers that will make the installation work the first time
[1:20:11] <%Monkeyweed21> which Dark Falz is the best Dark Falz?
[1:20:17] <Truxton_II> Sometimes it's also Dark Falz's dad, the Profound Darkness
[1:20:18] <%Jekado> the mmo part in this game is... weird
[1:20:21] <%Xelhesia> dark falz will always stay undefeated
[1:20:21] <+HefestoForges> ps4
[1:20:25] <Melchior_the_Wise> @Monkeyweed21 Dark Falz
[1:20:26] <%Dapper_Cactuar> didn't dark falz get resolved as an antagonistic force in PSO2 classic which takes place 1000 years before NGS?
