[0:02:03] <kasteni> Yo!
[0:02:10] <%YakumoYomi> I've spent 9 hours in SMTV, and haven't even reached Tokyo Tower. It's been a very long time since I've had so much fun just grinding in a JRPG.
[0:02:10] <%Felhad> psaDab psaDab psaDab
[0:02:15] <cartakus> The return of garbage DAY!
[0:02:26] <+Abd0022> pat plays the league of legends
[0:02:42] <%ChrisPlaysThing> yeyeye! Back fro mthe dep with beer and it's Goblin time!
[0:02:46] <%valriot> valriot subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Azem and Emet canonically held hands and stuff
[0:02:51] <bakkatohri> Okay y'all... League-related shenanigans time - lets not call each other bad words and run it down in chat.
[0:02:51] <%YakumoYomi> @cartakus No...!
[0:02:52] <%JoshManVGH> I look forward to this king being a lovable rascal that we're supposed to forgive because they said sorry after big murders.
[0:02:56] <ape_hawk> i just beat psychonauts 2. good game, pat should play it even off stream
[0:02:59] <@SoFarFetched> Oh god the colors
[0:03:11] <@SoFarFetched> I see the switch happened
[0:03:26] <%twistedj3ster> I just noticed, the colors are weird now
[0:03:28] <kingmemelord97> i thought pat hated lol
[0:03:29] <%solracc25> psaBig LoL
[0:03:32] <%Bluwizard21> i wish he'd continue no more heros league is cancer
[0:03:33] <mr_saturday93> I thought it was NMH3 today
[0:03:34] <Treasure_Vault> LMAO at that guy complaining that ruined king is or isn't canon. Nothing in LoL canon is canon.
[0:03:37] <@SoFarFetched> Pat switched f rom Streamlabs OBS to OBS
[0:03:38] <+moon_king> moon_king subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[0:03:41] <%JoshManVGH> @sofarfetched On mobile, did they change a layout or something?
[0:03:42] <~PatStaresAt> are alerts working
[0:03:44] <cherryburnout> the Ascians will rise again!
[0:03:45] <@SoFarFetched> sorry "streamlabs" to OBS
[0:03:47] <cartakus> Is that a bug?
[0:03:47] <@SoFarFetched> yeah the alerts are working
[0:03:53] <@SoFarFetched> you need to tweak the colors later though
[0:03:59] <%BoxNavy> slobs
[0:04:03] <@SoFarFetched> if you're trying to get like the original color/text
[0:04:05] <+Skelefellah> That whole Ruination thing is a big, grey blur. nothing matters in it
[0:04:07] <%RayReborne> fucking Zhens in SMTV fucking insta kill with the needle spray goddamnit
[0:04:11] <~PatStaresAt> =\ i can't remember what they are
[0:04:12] <%SaiyanShoto> Ohhh they’re multicolored now
[0:04:17] <%RayReborne> alerts work do thing yes
[0:04:20] <@SoFarFetched> @JoshManVGH  no pat switched from streamlabs to OBS
[0:04:26] <@SoFarFetched> cause of the recent news
[0:04:31] <bakkatohri> Nobody cares about any League event ever. They just want the rewards.
[0:04:35] <deviljhojho_> game looks interesting but i kind of wanted to keep watching pat get into FF XIV fights on twittter
[0:04:37] <+Skelefellah> Ah right the SLOBS case
[0:04:41] <cartakus> Seraphine isbest league...Thing
[0:04:42] <%ChrisPlaysThing> We could always go look at an old stream and take the eydropper tool to a screenshot
[0:04:44] <%Bluwizard21> elmo is pink
[0:04:45] <%JoshManVGH> I should go read the news
[0:04:47] <@SoFarFetched> so alerts are gonna be funky until Pat can tweak it.
[0:04:47] <deviljhojho_> I dont even play FFXIV
[0:04:49] <Daxalog> Did anyone play or finish Battle Chasers here?
[0:04:50] <kasteni> Just say it’s Christmas colors. Working as intended.
[0:04:52] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Get the hex codes
[0:04:53] <+Skelefellah> Best way to fight someone is to drag them out onto the street for all to see
[0:04:53] <%BoxNavy> i hate slobs
[0:04:56] <lehvak182> Time for OrbMan
[0:05:08] <Profmcstevie> *chuckles at orb* haha orb
[0:05:12] <bakkatohri> I wish I could play FFXIV... But I can't even get the client to work for some reason.
[0:05:22] <%Willbo_Baggins> Willbo_Baggins subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! Hey Pat! FFXIV delay finally kicked my butt into gear to finally finish up the Stormblood patches and complete Shadowbringers in time for endwalkerand man I really missed out on Shadowbringers this entire time, this expansion fucking rules.
[0:05:23] <~PatStaresAt> are the alerts funky? they seem to work fine aside from a little bit of a colou change
[0:05:24] <%RealThiele> slorbs
[0:05:33] <deviljhojho_> i own a """gaming""" laptop so i cant play for shit
[0:05:38] <@SoFarFetched> the alerts alot bigger than normal
[0:05:39] <+EdenOfLove> So no more heroes is pushed down again?
[0:05:41] <%RealThiele> yea color and font is different but i can see alerts
[0:05:43] <~PatStaresAt> They ARE bigger than normal
[0:05:44] <%YakumoYomi> @Daxalog I played about 10 hours, but dropped it because I was bored
[0:05:44] <%afronooch> besides them being bigger they seem fine
[0:05:45] <cartakus> Slurp the orb?
[0:05:50] <~PatStaresAt> I made them bigger
[0:05:52] <+polothegreatest> Time for some china bait champions LUL
[0:05:55] <@SoFarFetched> Oh then thats fine
[0:05:55] <%RayReborne> yeah the names and number of months subbed are different color its fine lol
[0:06:02] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Fine other than the colours, to me
[0:06:08] <~PatStaresAt> if theres colour issues Ill be glad to take suggestions
[0:06:13] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Enhanced
[0:06:15] <+Skelefellah> It's just small subtle color tweaks

[0:10:38] <%VictorVonLouche> @jorniev Emet Selch simp going a bit too crazy
[0:10:41] <%Cuon_Alpinus> I can't believe Pat killed a guy live on twitter and got away with it on Diplomatic immunity
[0:10:43] <Lodestarrobot> they had a meltdown cuz pat compared a character with trillions of deaths on his hands to hitler
[0:10:46] <%ThirdWelles> @jorniev Guy got mad at pat on twitter for calling Emet-Selch a bastard and argued for like an hour
[0:10:48] <ape_hawk> also your sub count is gone

[0:11:11] <deviljhojho_> IQ check
[0:11:17] <%tank7013> @jorniev Pat was talking about people that treat Emet like he was guilty and wanted redemption and was good all along and someone really wanted to pretend they were the main character of the argument
[0:11:17] <%AyotoCorp> I will send a picture on Twitter
[0:11:17] <cartakus> Emet who?
[0:11:18] <%SinnerEbru> LUL love pat keeping it real

[0:13:24] <%VictorVonLouche> Streamlabs WAS HORRIBLE trying to find out how to unsub
[0:13:25] <AllenDeadman> fucking yikes
[0:13:27] <+Skelefellah> It's just a ton of 'you made this? I made this.'
[0:13:32] <%MoguManda> glad I switched to elements a month ago
[0:13:35] <$realm_forge> Gotcha

[0:14:14] <%dekkitout> Did you make sure to write down the troubleshooting
[0:14:19] <%blastyoboots> @spooksy EXACTLY.  And they're doing a ton of SEO crap to redirect people from open source OBS on google to their "OBS"
[0:14:20] <%RealThiele> thanks swing shift tech person

[0:14:29] <+DeRedBaron> so collabs dont like really work for that

[0:15:19] <AvroEltz> Travis cant have shit
[0:15:23] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat loves snubbing suda51 to promote a game made by sex criminals
[0:15:24] <Lodestarrobot> twitter is bad but its best feature is people that really shouldn't be on it shining the spotlight on themselves

[0:15:55] <bakkatohri> What's the deal with Riot Games having more than one game? I thought their company name was supposed to be ironic.
[0:15:55] <Profmcstevie> Ooh, daring
[0:15:59] <%linSP> What about SMT!
[0:16:01] <%hewlettfan96> Did you foul the air just then

[0:18:58] <%JoshManVGH> If I had a nickel for each time Pat talked about horse cock, I'd have 2 nickels, which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice.
[0:19:00] <+alphonseisbest> PAT HAVE U BEEN WATCHING ARCANE?

[0:19:13] <%ThirdWelles> I haven't seen anything on this game is it a VN?
[0:19:15] <Kingsgrave_> its cool runeterra basically gave away 3 jayce champion cards for free

[0:19:38] <%ThirdWelles> Shoutout Frat culture
[0:19:39] <Treasure_Vault> LoL lore exists for whatever you're currently looking at.
[0:19:39] <%Monkeyweed21> Is it because Riot is run by sex offenders?
[0:19:39] <intestinal_bleeding> I can't stand the company but I do like the universe, even if it is just a composition of popular ideas
[0:19:40] <%hewlettfan96> @joshmanvgh Phone as and ferb really is such an influential and stellar show
[0:19:43] <%RealThiele> thank mr. street

[0:20:10] <+CptCreampuff16> checks out
[0:20:10] <iteruq> YEP
[0:20:14] <cartakus> Back off
[0:20:15] <Yubul> League of Legends is the worst part of League of Legends lol
[0:20:15] <+patel347> thats why everything is names runeterra and not league
[0:20:17] <AvroEltz> if you like the story, dont bother with league
[0:20:18] <intestinal_bleeding> @PatStaresAt I hate that Arcane has to be associated with Riot
[0:20:18] <Xalsunwolf> bout right
[0:20:19] <Tennochief> I unfortunately re-installed LoL
[0:20:23] <jorniev> DON'T
[0:20:23] <squishy_777> accurate
[0:20:23] <+polothegreatest> muhney
[0:20:26] <Saltmeisterr> cringe
[0:20:27] <Kingsgrave_> i like playing aram still
[0:20:30] <jorniev> THAT'S ME
[0:20:30] <%ThirdWelles> yay blitz
[0:20:32] <%Ne1son> League is fun
[0:20:36] <deviljhojho_> league players treat it like crack its fucking funny
[0:20:36] <%Ne1son> Just mute everyone
[0:20:36] <bakkatohri> League is so infuriating if you DO take it seriously - ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE TRYING TO CLIMB IN RANKED
[0:20:37] <Buttku> has pat seen arcane?
[0:20:38] <MrDrayko> Or there's the reverse, where people like me who stopped playing LoL YEARS ago, came back for this side shit because the actual game gives me conniptions
[0:20:40] <insomniac_doze_> teamfight tactics is the chad choice
[0:20:40] <+Skelefellah> Honestly? Not a bad idea.
[0:20:40] <%VictorVonLouche> Honestly the lore is kinda shit and all over the place
[0:20:43] <Shardlab> I will never play that game, because I HATE mobas
[0:20:45] <cartakus> Lol fighting game still a thing?
[0:20:45] <LoudmicRPG> League of Legends is poop. Legends of Runeterra, Teamfight Tactics and Ruined King are actually good
[0:20:46] <+alphonseisbest> YES
[0:20:46] <%cooldude69xx> Robot? Thats no way to talk about chat
[0:20:47] <+BIumen> that seems to be how they do their worldbuilding now

[0:20:49] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt did you see the thing about Bobby Kotick threatening to put a hit out on an employee?
[0:20:49] <+alphonseisbest> ME TOO
[0:20:50] <+CptCreampuff16> i mean runeterra is where all the lore is so thats kinda right
[0:20:50] <AvroEltz> I pretend tft is the primary game
[0:20:51] <intestinal_bleeding> yeah
[0:20:54] <Kingsgrave_> I wish Runeterra got primary game funding because man its rough waiting 3+ months for balance patches
[0:20:55] <%Monkeyweed21> its still made by the sex offender company tho
[0:20:56] <jorniev> I HATE ALL THIS NEW SHIT, WHAT IF IT'S REALLY GOOD AND I HAVE TO LIKENIT
[0:20:56] <Treasure_Vault> Veigar is still the coolest
[0:20:57] <Kaji04> fair
[0:20:57] <dmysta3000> Sounds fair
[0:20:58] <%Birdigalore> Nah the fghter is the primary game
[0:20:59] <%solracc25> The best part of league of legends is not league of legends
[0:20:59] <+Grifsor> From time to time and not seriously is the ONLY healthy way to play league. I've been playing for 8 years and I only realized that about 2 years ago
[0:21:00] <NeonBleu> But...they all say a league of legends story
[0:21:03] <@Ranryu692> is runeterra even still going?
[0:21:06] <+alphonseisbest> CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT FIGHTING GAME
[0:21:10] <Daxalog> @cartakus  lol fighting game had to be reworked
[0:21:11] <bakkatohri> @solracc25 yes
[0:21:12] <+alphonseisbest> any day now Roit
[0:21:14] <%Hobojo153> Hobojo153 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 30 month streak! Man seeing people not understand the difference between a villain being redeemed and moving on was fucking hilarious and depressing.That said you're nuts thinking Zenos is more charming.
[0:21:15] <intestinal_bleeding> the lore is like, remember that league was kinda making its characters off of popular concepts, it's very much "video gamey" if that makes sense?
[0:21:15] <+Skelefellah> I hear Wild Rift's like really good compared to LoL
[0:21:15] <+alphonseisbest> *Riot
[0:21:16] <%EdgarLOLZ> Leag bad *dab
[0:21:16] <PunishedRaccoon> i thought it was
[0:21:18] <%dekkitout> Which is Wild Rift?
[0:21:18] <nobody287> is it going to PC?
[0:21:20] <chillygreem> Hey Pat are you doing ok? You look emaciated
[0:21:21] <%RealThiele> wild grift
[0:21:22] <+PMAvers> Wild Rift's quite nice.
[0:21:23] <cs0402196> wild rift is great
[0:21:24] <%YakumoYomi> I've never played League, but I did play Pokemon Unite for about a week. That...was enough.
[0:21:27] <%VictorVonLouche> Wild Rift is like 100% more optimised
[0:21:27] <Press_X_ToJASON> wild rift is actually better, down to the menus, it has more IN-GAME info
[0:21:28] <intestinal_bleeding> like remember when Vi came out? that was when Borderlands 2 landed
[0:21:29] <MessyBristles> Its not going to pc
[0:21:30] <%Ne1son> I disagree
[0:21:32] <+polothegreatest> anxiety for being flamed also buy waifu sht TPFufun
[0:21:34] <deviljhojho_> is is the one with the skunk lady
[0:21:35] <%SvenHolgersson> But it's still League of Legends
[0:21:36] <bakkatohri> Bite sized games that don't take forever to complete, right?
[0:21:37] <%SvenHolgersson> So no
[0:21:37] <Treasure_Vault> Riot devs gave me magic cards at a prerelease once. He was a cool guy who probably didn't sexually assault anyone.
[0:21:37] <%Birdigalore> @PatStaresAt  what's the difference from regular LoL?
[0:21:38] <NatusSalis> Cum detected
[0:21:39] <+alphonseisbest> whats it play like/
[0:21:40] <+alphonseisbest> ?
[0:21:43] <+PMAvers> Oh my  god can they eventually port the UI stuff to PC League?
[0:21:43] <cartakus> Man I just want to play as monster characters in thst game
[0:21:47] <fairore> dam
[0:21:48] <CandybagCJ> It's what League of Legends would be if it was built from the ground up right now
[0:21:48] <%dekkitout> What about blue stacks?
[0:21:50] <%PocketBearIllustrator> hey, Pat n chat
[0:21:52] <intestinal_bleeding> the only thing I hate about Wild rift is what they did to the Yordles
[0:21:53] <%valriot> 343 already changing BP stuff next week
[0:21:55] <%EdgarLOLZ> the models look better then of
[0:21:58] <+Grifsor> Can't you play it on Bluestacks or something?
[0:21:58] <%EdgarLOLZ> pc
[0:22:01] <Shardlab> For all ya'll MTG folks: Wild Rift is the Arena to LoL's Magic Online
[0:22:02] <Daxalog> Wild Rift for sure isnt better. Certain changes breaks some characters for me. Alongside not having all the characters I like.
[0:22:03] <+polothegreatest> sucks lags like crazy
[0:22:04] <MessyBristles> just console and mobile
[0:22:05] <%JoshManVGH> So, fun?
[0:22:06] <+alphonseisbest> YOOOOOOOOO
[0:22:07] <cs0402196> digital controls hurt my thumb joints
[0:22:11] <Lodestarrobot> are the people you play with the worst part of the game
[0:22:13] <CandybagCJ> its not locked into any of the spaghetti code or old standards of mobas
[0:22:15] <bakkatohri> OH GOD LEAGUE IS LONG ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMEBODY HOLDS YOU HOSTAGE
[0:22:17] <%VictorVonLouche> Basically doing HOTS but not Activision
[0:22:18] <+patel347> league just has too much legacy baggage
[0:22:23] <+alphonseisbest> THAT SOUNDS HYPE
[0:22:24] <%dekkitout> So for slightly more well adjusted folks
[0:22:29] <nobody287> Ahri was one of starter people 10/10 game
[0:22:29] <%BoxNavy> d i ablo
[0:22:30] <%BoocherOnTwitch> I love watching Pat thrash people on Twitter
[0:22:31] <%Birdigalore> D-I-Ablo games
[0:22:31] <jorniev> holy shit
[0:22:32] <+aslfrasle> Also, way less toxic because, as far as I'm aware, NO TEAM CHAT.
[0:22:34] <%cvp5127> more like pokemon unut
[0:22:37] <Dova573> idk about that

[0:30:18] <%BoxNavy> oh. im trying to get the onion knight helm :)
[0:30:18] <%Skelefellah> You'd need to hang onto anything you kill along the way, assuming you even don't run past it.

[0:30:23] <Namboto> I'm embarking on the path of madness; I'm trying to collect as many triple triad cards as possible before endwalker

[0:31:28] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> We love to hate him
[0:31:28] <peyodogo> he is such a good character it convinces people he's a good character
[0:31:29] <%VictorVonLouche> He also has noble goals in his view that you cannot agree with.
[0:31:30] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Just dont bore hi tho

[0:35:03] <%ThirdWelles> fuck that all the way
[0:35:08] <cartakus> Minh max?
[0:35:10] <%afronooch> afronooch subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! HOT TAKE: Stormblood rules exclusively because of the daytime theme in Yanxia
[0:35:13] <%MoguManda> imagine if you saw something you made played like that
[0:35:14] <cliffpuncher> The story is probably my main source of enjoyment. I'd fucking hate that
[0:35:24] <%chance_h> During Stormblood expansion, the quest giver Raubans special instanced event was dos’d by just the large load of players
[0:35:29] <%BoxNavy> ew whatt he fuck
[0:35:34] <peyodogo> god that's a vile way to play ffxiv
[0:35:38] <%dekkitout> I like the cut of his jib
[0:35:41] <Tennochief> Impressive, but sounds miserable
[0:35:44] <%28moogles> He does that so he can rush out "guides", but they are often wrong.
[0:35:46] <Namboto> my static actually refers to bad but still technically viable raid strats as "mr happy strats"
[0:35:47] <+EySoyCoco> what was the problem with that wall im so lost
[0:35:52] <KenzBurp> fuck happy brambles

[0:37:04] <%PocketBearIllustrator> miss tech is where I go to for trial or raid guides, personally.

[0:37:10] <%afronooch> mtqcapture
[0:37:10] <Tracazoid> I go to her for all my dungeon guiding needs
[0:37:10] <%RealThiele> MTQ
[0:37:11] <%chiazam> WHY!?!?
[0:37:11] <%AHomeschoolDropout> being a new player it'll be interesting finally playing a duty without the entire playerbase already knowing
[0:37:11] <%MrP33Ps> MTQ is very good
[0:37:11] <+emperri> member when he whiteknighted SE for the blufever leaks and got an attaboy from the staff and then bragged about it
[0:37:12] <%shurtal> your beginners guide
[0:37:12] <Qsmash_> MTQ is a life saver
[0:37:12] <Blu_C> Pat! You're doing it wrong! Plug yourself first!
[0:37:14] <LilacsandFreedom> MTQ is very good
[0:37:17] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> boooooo

[0:37:40] <%RealThiele> she WILL help you on 14 shes a great teacher
[0:37:41] <Tennochief> I prefer Misshapen Chair
[0:37:41] <+trackles_64> BOOBA?
[0:37:42] <MhokuVerrix> @PatStaresAt have you pondered the orb today?
[0:37:44] <%BoxNavy> i like weskalber and misshapen chair
[0:37:44] <%PrimalDweeb> Basically Black Mage is funny as hell.
[0:37:53] <SummonerMagno> jocat's crap guides are funny
[0:37:54] <+Mrbaconator> i only experience final fantasy 14 vicariously through you complaining about it on the podcast
[0:37:55] <+CookieCutter007> the absolute pain that is Destiny 2 raid guides
[0:37:57] <+emperri> that's no orb, it's a bag
[0:37:59] <Sprawler14> oh hey so since this is a LoL-adjacent stream how about that Arcane
[0:38:02] <%Monkeyweed21> Hot take: a villain accepting defeat and hoping you can live up to the example set by his people instead of forgetting them  IS NOT redemption

[0:46:15] <critfumble_> GOTTEM
[0:46:17] <%pepzi_boyz> TRUE!
[0:46:18] <+trackles_64> would be nice
[0:46:19] <chillygreem> Sure would be nice
[0:46:22] <dredgyboi> sadly Riot is also garbo
[0:46:24] <vegetablespy> not in my heart his still shooting berrals and eating oranges
[0:46:25] <%KetsuoTaberu> psaDab
[0:46:25] <nintega010> @wackygear he tried to bring her back to life, but it brought her back in a bad state and drove him insane and he made the shadow isles. Look up Necrit to find out league lore better
[0:46:26] <fairore> oh pat
[0:46:29] <nobody287> sure would be
[0:46:31] <%ThirdWelles> oh way better
[0:46:32] <KaiserMario> Hashtag sponsored
[0:46:33] <%Logoth_> Wow this is an actual game, I thought this was a card game expansion or some shit
[0:46:33] <+patel347> This was made by an indie studio you are safe pat
[0:46:34] <+emperri> sex perverts are okay, it's the criminal part
[0:46:34] <slatersev> Airship Syndicate was the one who actually MADE it
[0:46:34] <%vice127> to be fair it's an Indie company
[0:46:36] <LoreKeeper_Thal> i mean, it wasn't MADE by them, but it's their series
[0:46:36] <slatersev> so its fine
[0:46:37] <%Monkeyweed21> the taint is on all of these great games
[0:46:40] <nechronia> To be fair it was just commissioned by the sex perverts
[0:46:45] <SinisterBroccoli> would it destroy all hope if it turned out the ffxiv devs like sacrificed babies to make their game or something?
[0:46:45] <chillygreem> Yeah their CTO's a massive Scumbag.
[0:46:45] <%WackyGear> @nintega010 thanks
[0:46:48] <LoreKeeper_Thal> Airship Syndicate is aight
[0:46:49] <+emperri> heheh, taint
[0:46:49] <Zalthia> Yeah, this was outsourced to an indie dev.
[0:46:49] <vegetablespy> why are games ran by garbage people?
[0:46:49] <redthebaron> HUGE SUBTITLES
[0:46:54] <+CptCreampuff16> isnt this made by a different studio than riot?
[0:46:55] <KaiserMario> Game is very loud
[0:46:56] <MrDrayko> Published* by sex perverts

[0:47:00] <%Ne1son> Commissioned by not made by
[0:47:02] <+0dinpen> pat said and and I looked around for the #sponsored logo sajamSolphisticated
[0:47:03] <%ThirdWelles> Say it
[0:47:04] <%PocketBearIllustrator> it's also why I hesitate in watching Arcane on Netflix. I don't want to give them the revenue.

[0:50:33] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @tomschiii that's the thing. it looks REALLY good, in terms of art and animation. I just don't feel comfortable with contributing avenue to a game company who's pretty garbo to their employees.
[0:50:35] <cartakus> It's turn-based?
[0:50:35] <+patel347> its nice to actually see bilgewater

[0:51:07] <MarvelousMrD> except for the part where he didnt die
[0:51:07] <+CptCreampuff16> remember this is a setup for an event that already happened
[0:51:08] <+BIumen> the best event ever in league
[0:51:09] <Daxalog> Funfact. When Gangplank dies he wasnt selectable in game for a week or 2
[0:51:09] <cs0402196> slit his throat tho

[0:52:05] <dredgyboi> he died, but got better
[0:52:06] <arkv01> is gangplank undead or something?
[0:52:06] <Zalthia> @TheHeroAppears For like a week! Then he came back with a Visual Update!

[0:52:08] <cs0402196> batman
[0:52:08] <MrDrayko> Yeah he straight was removed from the game for a time @PatStaresAt
[0:52:10] <+CptCreampuff16> happened like 6 years ago
[0:52:12] <vegetablespy> wasn't their an in-game event where gangeplank or MF would be killed in the lor?
[0:52:13] <%Buzzard42> they removed Gangplank from LoL for a bit when he died
[0:52:13] <TIME_PUNCHER> Sea of Thieves looks different
[0:52:13] <chillygreem> Yeah he's super dead but he got better
[0:52:14] <%aishman> gangplank is dead?!
[0:52:14] <Daxalog> Gangplank got voted on to be killed. It was either Gangplank or Graves / Twisted Fate.
[0:52:15] <+Davion_Salkovich> @captain_thickthighs how dare
[0:52:16] <+jojo_abob> He died but he ate an orange
[0:52:16] <Lunarclock> Throwback to when he died and they made him unplayable for a bit

[0:52:57] <%greasypete00> Miss Fortune is a hussy now
[0:52:57] <%AncelDeLambert> GP dying was the arc that happened before his rework
[0:52:58] <%notsoy> wait, miss fortune is brown?
[0:53:01] <Yubul> Yes.
[0:53:01] <%chiazam> this looks good
[0:53:01] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yes
[0:53:02] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @tomschiii that's fair.
[0:53:03] <Daxalog> Nope
[0:53:03] <%Ne1son> No
[0:53:03] <%BoocherOnTwitch> He was unselectable during a bilgewater centered event because MF killed him in the story lol
[0:53:04] <+TheAdMerlin> It is
[0:53:05] <%pepzi_boyz> No :(
[0:53:05] <ape_hawk> no
[0:53:06] <MrDrayko> Here, yes
[0:53:06] <+Grifsor> no it's not
[0:53:08] <+Rofiarf> no
[0:53:09] <mortificent> Kind of
[0:53:10] <Frostydough1> no its not, that looks way better
[0:53:10] <TheMadBadger> It's her Canon outfit
[0:53:10] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt this is League Battle Chasers edition
[0:53:11] <chillygreem> By the way
[0:53:11] <+jojo_abob> i dont think so
[0:53:12] <Zalthia> Captain Miss Fortune > Miss Fortune
[0:53:12] <+Kyma1020> it should be
[0:53:12] <%VictorVonLouche> no
[0:53:12] <+Sushi2k> Nay
[0:53:12] <Majestic_Flof> MF was always a hussy
[0:53:15] <%sriracha_pon> Dat battle chasers tho
[0:53:16] <Daxalog> only here
[0:53:16] <%AncelDeLambert> I haven't played in over a year, so iunno
[0:53:17] <%Jeemukun> Sarah Fortune
[0:53:18] <AllenDeadman> here yes, in actual league? no
[0:53:18] <Dova573> Wait Gangkplank was the king of the Pirates?
[0:53:19] <+patel347> oh cool its rafen
[0:53:20] <chillygreem> This is absolutely, actually Joe Mad
[0:53:21] <nobody287> I wish it was
[0:53:23] <MessyBristles> no i wish
[0:53:23] <%dekkitout> Looked up psm cover- he is right
[0:53:25] <Abd0022> no it's her current lore look
[0:53:25] <Lixagon> Did the battle chaser guys do this?
[0:53:25] <The_Murray_Carp> it's her "captain" skin
[0:53:26] <+jojo_abob> i wanna kiss that man
[0:53:27] <%EdgarLOLZ> captain skin
[0:53:27] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> she got de-bimbofied in the lore
[0:53:31] <+coldsama> canon yes, in-game no
[0:53:33] <+BaronBlackwood> Sort of. She is Officially a Captain and this is her Leader uniform, but she still looks like a hussy in game.
[0:53:34] <%Ne1son> Captain Miss Fortune is not Default no
[0:53:34] <+patel347> I always wondered how rafen looked
[0:53:35] <%bevyrage> @greasypete00 it's like you didn't know she was originally just a plastic blow up doll in league
[0:53:35] <%ThirdWelles> Is that Laura Bailey?
[0:53:36] <+skylerpilot> literally Limsa Lominsa
[0:53:36] <%RealThiele> girl must have doubts about her leadership
[0:53:36] <slatersev> Nah
[0:53:36] <%minimumeffortmaximumderp> minimumeffortmaximumderp subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[0:53:37] <%Buzzard42> @Lixagon yes
[0:53:40] <%PocketBearIllustrator> rafen's kinda hot, not gonna lie.
[0:53:43] <Frostydough1> KEKW
[0:53:45] <+polothegreatest> nah skin
[0:53:45] <slatersev> MF still flirts with and fucks plenty
[0:53:45] <+emperri> she reminds me of that game with the sword girl from ps3 launch
[0:53:46] <%afronooch> de-bimboification
[0:53:47] <arkv01> so her whitegirl look is retired?
[0:53:48] <+Sushi2k> Used to be waaaaaaaaaay worse
[0:53:49] <intestinal_bleeding> ah yes old Miss Fortune
[0:53:49] <+emperri> whatever the fuck that was called
[0:53:50] <%RealThiele> REBIMBOED
[0:53:51] <noddy182> This is definitely better than her base in League
[0:53:52] <slatersev> she just has a more practical day outfit
[0:53:53] <Blank9> give him the stick DON'T GIVE HIM THE STICK
[0:53:53] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> it did not
[0:53:54] <Zalthia> Mmm
[0:53:55] <cs0402196> kept her walk
[0:53:57] <Tomschiii> the voice of her is just too well known.
[0:53:58] <ape_hawk> its a good art style
[0:53:59] <vegetablespy> I thought it was a free skin for doing the event a few years ago. Like OG gangeplank skin instead of the default with robot arm
[0:53:59] <cartakus> That kinda fucked
[0:54:00] <%AncelDeLambert> probably used the same models
[0:54:00] <Slimshazbot> I mean it looks way better
[0:54:02] <cherrycottontail> OH this studio also made the darksiders diablo-like game
[0:54:03] <AllenDeadman> looks like league... but good
[0:54:05] <MoonKing> That's a smart
[0:54:06] <%SinnerEbru> totally thought this WAS LoL
[0:54:13] <%chiazam> Nah it took
[0:54:13] <%BinaryFireball> trying to think if this is the same engine
[0:54:15] <%Ne1son> No because it sucks
[0:54:17] <+CptCreampuff16> no cause that would just replace league
[0:54:17] <Yubul> Nah no Wild Rift on PC
[0:54:17] <Manwad> wild rift is comin' to consoles
[0:54:19] <+cermo55> ?
[0:54:21] <Zalthia> I WISH this was LoL
[0:54:26] <%AncelDeLambert> dunno, that doesn't look like her strut
[0:54:28] <AvroEltz> Hell no, it will take people from regular league
[0:54:30] <MarvelousMrD> oh you can really tell where they took from that battlechasers game
[0:54:31] <Profmcstevie> Probably afraid it'll leech players LUL
[0:54:32] <+emperri> is she level 9
[0:54:35] <%MugenSandan> if Wild Rift came to PC then why would PC League need to exist
[0:54:36] <%chance_h> Now I want to watch some “lore” videos
[0:54:36] <%OldNeckBeard> no wild rift is lol but for mobile
[0:54:37] <%Ne1son> Wild Rift sucks me hard through my Jorts
[0:54:41] <intestinal_bleeding> i'd play Wild Rift but not having my shit transition over is just... I can'd o it
[0:54:45] <%BoocherOnTwitch> To twitter!
[0:54:46] <MessyBristles> nope juct consoles and mobile
[0:54:49] <%ThirdWelles> Probably don't want to compete with their own game
[0:54:49] <T_Sasquatch> the whole point of wild rift is to make it easier for console and monbile gamers to play
[0:54:51] <+TaylOctopus91> I want Wild Rift on consoles already. I don't play games on my phone.
[0:54:51] <%afronooch> gottem
[0:54:52] <+emperri> gottem
[0:54:52] <+EySoyCoco> gottem
[0:54:53] <+Emperor_Z> Is Wild Rift very different from LoL? I thought it was just LoL but simplified for mobile
[0:54:53] <+DoktorZee> gottem
[0:54:54] <whittacre> GATTEM
[0:54:54] <%blastyoboots> LUL
[0:54:54] <%Skelefellah> The reversal
[0:54:54] <%dekkitout> +3
[0:54:54] <%Logoth_> then he exploded
[0:54:55] <SaltyAzteca> THATS A REVERSE GOTTEM
[0:54:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> AUUUGHHHH
[0:54:55] <%SinnerEbru> LUL good jorb
[0:54:56] <GoYaK> This reminds me SO MUCH of Bastion
[0:54:56] <+polothegreatest> no, we have wild rift at home
[0:54:56] <Jontman42> fucking gottem
[0:54:59] <arkv01> I've not played lol in years but this is the lol rpg I've always wanted
[0:55:00] <iosephe> gottem
[0:55:01] <%baka_sugoi> LUL Balls
[0:55:01] <Zalthia> ????
[0:55:02] <%chance_h> Kids mad
[0:55:03] <cs0402196> lol
[0:55:06] <%captain_thickthighs> pat no
[0:55:08] <cartakus> This is so dumb
[0:55:11] <T_Sasquatch> putting it on pc would affect their playerbase
[0:55:16] <Lunarclock> Who's ronald reagan
[0:55:20] <%Puhff> stop stealing my joke
[0:55:24] <vegetablespy> Man LOL is sticking its fingers into everything
[0:55:26] <+emperri> why is the tutorial more complex than a skyrim dungeon
[0:55:29] <%SinnerEbru> @lunarclock some fuck
[0:55:29] <%SaiyanShoto> Was that a message from Howard?
[0:55:32] <Zalthia> Hey it's her Q
[0:55:33] <%RealThiele> go visit Sugonda
[0:55:36] <Slimshazbot> I'm just glad we're seeing League realized ad literally any game other than Leage
[0:55:40] <+Ez3z> this game has too many tutorials, pretty much my only major complaint with it as of now
[0:55:45] <%Skelefellah> Number go up!
[0:55:45] <MrDrayko> Loot button for crazies
[0:55:46] <cartakus> is mordekeiser a good guy?
[0:55:50] <%Ne1son> @PAt do you play league with screen lock on?
[0:55:54] <+Queenemereldas> big battlechasers energy
[0:55:59] <+CptCreampuff16> morde is not good guy
[0:56:00] <Frostydough1> dont forget to talk to Malonge
[0:56:02] <ape_hawk> @cartakus hes morally grey
[0:56:02] <+DeRedBaron> hey more tutorial than league
[0:56:03] <Zalthia> @cartakus No. Very No.
[0:56:09] <Saltmeisterr> @Queenemereldas same devs
[0:56:10] <vegetablespy> Mort is the best guy
[0:56:12] <%vice127> same people who made Battle Chasers
[0:56:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Do we get to play as candis in this game
[0:56:17] <%MugenSandan> I see Pat has unlocked Goblin-radar
[0:56:22] <ToneBacas> o no
[0:56:22] <cartakus> He seems so chill though
[0:56:29] <Sol_Install> yoyo
[0:56:29] <%RealThiele> scullery maid
[0:56:31] <topiodonk> why is gp the devil
[0:56:34] <+aslfrasle> @cartakus Is he "actually" morally grey, or is he evil but hot.
[0:56:35] <deviljhojho_> lmao
[0:56:37] <%KetsuoTaberu> lmao
[0:56:38] <%PrimalDweeb> LUL
[0:56:38] <AvroEltz> WOOOOOOW
[0:56:39] <intestinal_bleeding> christ
[0:56:39] <%VictorVonLouche> Oh this is going to be mommy issues the plot.
[0:56:39] <ape_hawk> that wasnt gp, that was a silhouette
[0:56:40] <vegetablespy> man he's so COOL!
[0:56:40] <+emperri> ghosts?
[0:56:40] <%pepzi_boyz> NoooO
[0:56:40] <%KineticZen> Pffff
[0:56:41] <%Skelefellah> BIG ANGY CRY
[0:56:41] <@SoFarFetched> WHATS WRONG WITH YOUR FAAACEE
[0:56:41] <akitanito> that's a very small caliber bullet
[0:56:42] <%Ne1son> Thats a monkey face
[0:56:42] <Visorak6> Yeah that doesnt look great
[0:56:42] <@goose_attack_almanac> She was evolving
[0:56:43] <+pectusumbra> so ghost GP or ghost family? Place your bets
[0:56:44] <+dante_must_die_exe> LUL
[0:56:44] <%RealThiele> :O
[0:56:44] <chillygreem> SHE WAS POSSESED lol
[0:56:45] <%KuroStardust> that was goofballs
[0:56:48] <SocialMisfitGamer> NOOOOOOO
[0:56:48] <+DeRedBaron> oh no its funny
[0:56:49] <+dante_must_die_exe> OHHHH
[0:56:53] <%KineticZen> That ain't all you got in your chest
[0:56:53] <%Puhff> D:
[0:56:54] <Manwad> @topiodonk because he can crit your ass for 1.3k
[0:56:54] <deviljhojho_> literally digivolving
[0:56:55] <MarvelousMrD> my parents are dead pog
[0:56:57] <%PocketBearIllustrator> is LoL's playerbase still toxic AF?
[0:57:01] <+polothegreatest> budget go down
[0:57:02] <+bluestbee> HE'S SUPER NOT THOUGH
[0:57:04] <$realm_forge> Wow getting shot gives you powers
[0:57:05] <sun312772> Wrong
[0:57:08] <+Emperor_Z> It's funny seeing Gangplank treated as a serious character considering he was designed as like a pirtate-themed pirate who eats oranges to heal
[0:57:09] <%Ne1son> Yes Gangplank is totally dead
[0:57:09] <%pepzi_boyz> @PocketBearIllustrator always has been
[0:57:10] <%captain_thickthighs> why are women always shot/stabbed in the stomach in games
[0:57:11] <+CptCreampuff16> yes
[0:57:12] <%Buzzard42> @PocketBearIllustrator hell yeah
[0:57:14] <%MugenSandan> she really made a D: face
[0:57:14] <anAngryHamster> So how many times has League rebooted its lore?
[0:57:14] <Visorak6> always will be
[0:57:15] <%cade_calrayn> always wil be
[0:57:15] <+Akizea> @PocketBearIllustrator it'll take you about 3 games to be called to n word i promise
[0:57:16] <%RealThiele> got shot, no scars
[0:57:16] <%Puhff> her tits are filled with bullets
[0:57:17] <+dante_must_die_exe> always will be
[0:57:18] <+kewlmyc> 100%
[0:57:18] <LoreKeeper_Thal> that will NEVER get fixed
[0:57:20] <%Gasgrave> Man, they polished this edge to a fine sheen!
[0:57:21] <Slimshazbot> @PocketBearIllustrator It's only ever going to get worse
[0:57:22] <%KineticZen> Goofy pirate becomes serious bad guyman
[0:57:24] <%KetsuoTaberu> every F2P game's playerbase is toxic as fuck
[0:57:26] <%notsoy> league is blighttown - forever ruined by poison
[0:57:28] <T_Sasquatch> @PocketBearIllustrator you would if you had to 1v9 for 30mins in a loss after 5 mins
[0:57:28] <devanmuse> Is that Kaine voicing the protagonist?
[0:57:33] <Wolveus> i was playing my like 7th game ever and some guy was shitting on me super hard
[0:57:35] <+Akizea> but that MUTE ALL BUTTON GO CRAZY THO
[0:57:35] <%pepzi_boyz> league is actually playable if you use "/mute all"
[0:57:38] <cartakus> You can't ruin a beautiful face
[0:57:39] <%BinaryFireball> because it is
[0:57:41] <%Ne1son> Just mute people, you never have to interact with them
[0:57:43] <rusho> This reminds me of battle chasers
[0:57:43] <intestinal_bleeding> play league and hit that mute all, your time will be more enjoyed that way
[0:57:44] <%MugenSandan> @anangryhamster they're rebooting it as we speak
[0:57:44] <@goose_attack_almanac> League is a video game that you play with other people in a competitive nature. It will always be toxic.
[0:57:45] <%Monkeyweed21> Why do I have the feeling like this game is going to try #Girlbossing real hard and they're gonna miss the mark
[0:57:45] <%BinaryFireball> im not joking
[0:57:46] <%RealThiele> yes miss fortune is laura bailey is Kaine
[0:57:49] <Aoworth> Gangplank was an *idea*
[0:57:51] <ChaosedStar> if u wanna play league stuffs play runeterra haha
[0:57:51] <+CptCreampuff16> did you hear they removed all chat when its your teammates that are the toxic one
[0:57:53] <ToneBacas> testing the waters?
[0:57:53] <+patel347> I wonder if the first bit was intented to be a demo
[0:57:57] <Daxalog> Did you ever play Battlerite or Bloodline Champions?
[0:58:06] <%PocketBearIllustrator> ah, well. Still sticking to FFXIV. I love a friendly community. not a fair comparison, I know
[0:58:11] <deviljhojho_> he is speaking the language of the gods
[0:58:11] <%Ne1son> TRhey did not remove all chat
[0:58:12] <+Akizea> laura bailey does a good job as mf i wish they'd update her voice in game too
[0:58:16] <%Ne1son> They walked it back
[0:58:16] <Visorak6> He means you cant talk to the enemy team
[0:58:24] <Lunarclock> Some regions kept all chat
[0:58:26] <%RealThiele> and if laura is here i expect more CR cast voicing
[0:58:26] <+Emperor_Z> You can't talk to the enemy team any more, even though most toxicity comes from your own team
[0:58:27] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> AllChat meaning you cant talk to enemies, but your team can still flame you
[0:58:27] <%ThirdWelles> Allchat in League was gonna get removed from the game
[0:58:28] <%KineticZen> They were going to remove the ability to talk to enemies
[0:58:28] <@goose_attack_almanac> They wanted to remove All Chat in league matches. But your teammates are always more toxic.
[0:58:31] <ChaosedStar> @goose_attack_almanac dont forget the free part too, cause thats a factor as well
[0:58:34] <deviljhojho_> nice abs, asshole
[0:58:34] <nintega010> @monkeyweed21 what is girl bossing?
[0:58:37] <%nipplestheenchilada96> it just means team chat is going to get more toxic lets be real
[0:58:37] <%Monkeyweed21> they removed /all and then put it back in
[0:58:43] <+polothegreatest> they never care about Lore NotLikeThis
[0:58:43] <arkv01> chats right, all chat was never the problem
[0:58:45] <%RealThiele> captain abs
[0:58:47] <+Snigglegros> i thought the patch notes said they removed all chat in some regions
[0:58:47] <scrumbotime> This looks like Battlechasers: Nightwar but worse
[0:58:52] <+Grifsor> @PatStaresAt Riot was going to remove all-chat for some regions but they reverted the change when NA people cried about it
[0:58:54] <+CptCreampuff16> they removed the ability to talk to the enemy to reduce toxicity but most of the toxicity comes from your ow teammates
[0:58:55] <akitanito> alll of theem
[0:58:57] <%OldNeckBeard> they got rid of all chat in most regions, north america got to keep it
[0:58:57] <MrDrayko> Just the bad ones
[0:58:59] <Dova573> He ate the ab ab fruit
[0:59:01] <T_Sasquatch> no joke ive never experienced toxicity for the enemy team, just memes
[0:59:02] <%Puhff> oh yeah All Chat is nowhere near as toxc as Team Chat
[0:59:03] <notaplushtoy> oh hey laura bailey!
[0:59:03] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:59:04] <ape_hawk> captain thorne, more like captain washboard
[0:59:06] <%Jeemukun> oh hi bender
[0:59:11] <%PocketBearIllustrator> but yeah, competitive games with a toxic community ain't my thing
[0:59:15] <T_Sasquatch> from*
[0:59:19] <%CalderGaming> Merlwyb did it better
[0:59:19] <cartakus> God I do not care for human characters in fantasy games
[0:59:21] <+FadingEmber> I am not going to lie this entire franchise feels like a low rent version of MCU origin stories marketed to people who hate other people and themselves.
[0:59:24] <deviljhojho_> might work
[0:59:25] <%KineticZen> She's just a less interesting Merlwyb, and that's saying something
[0:59:26] <Lunarclock> My worst in-game experience was my own teammates telling me to die lol, not the other team
[0:59:33] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Dojima?
[0:59:36] <Lunarclock> Fortune wants what Merlwyb has
[0:59:37] <+emperri> oh no he called her "girl"
[0:59:40] <%RealThiele> grABS
[0:59:42] <+emperri> time for girlboss power
[0:59:42] <%notsoy> I'LL KILL YOU
[0:59:45] <arkv01> LUL
[0:59:46] <akitanito> who could have thunk
[0:59:46] <LoreKeeper_Thal> WONDERFUL 101, FUCK SHIT UP
[0:59:46] <deviljhojho_> UNITE UP
[0:59:47] <%Logoth_> Let's attack her in groups of two!
[0:59:48] <SocialMisfitGamer> That's the line

[1:00:07] <%chiazam> Oh hey sexism
[1:00:07] <+emperri> the wheel of fate is turning
[1:00:07] <blue8moon> I find it kinda silly that she just runs around with her guns out when nothing's going on LUL
[1:00:08] <+Grifsor> time to engage in "AGGRESSIVE NEGOTIATIONS"
[1:00:09] <akitanito> why not icon
[1:00:09] <arkv01> this turn based UI was not what I expected
[1:00:11] <%captain_thickthighs> Her name is mis-fortune!?
[1:00:13] <%Skelefellah> No Pat it's Runeterra Cards now
[1:00:13] <EliteDemonThunder> card is fairly accurate tho
[1:00:14] <+pectusumbra> it's just a term
[1:00:14] <nobody287> it's Runeterra
[1:00:16] <LoneFonte> cards as in display
[1:00:23] <%Monkeyweed21> @nintega010 when a writer (usually a dude) tries to make a strong and solid female character and ends up missing the mark by just making them mean assholes that do what they want
[1:00:24] <AvroEltz> Fancy lingo is really necessary
[1:00:25] <Aoworth> wapw

[1:00:41] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @Lunarclock the weirdest insult i ever got in league was someone on my team, a morgana, called me an "n-word egg" and i to this day, years later, do not know what the FUCK that means
[1:00:45] <%PocketBearIllustrator> real talk, tho. I feel the character portraits should emote for different situations.
[1:00:46] <+emperri> the gwent composer wants to know riot's location
[1:00:50] <JowiJoestar> wow

[1:01:18] <%RealThiele> oh no
[1:01:19] <SaltyAzteca> KOF had that
[1:01:19] <%Logoth_> Because Fatal Fury fans loved the line system
[1:01:19] <%solracc25> JUNGLE
[1:01:19] <+Mrbaconator> TOP IS FED
[1:01:19] <ToneBacas> no like LoL

[1:01:20] <Lunarclock> @sashagreenspiderqueen that is such a fascinating insult.
[1:01:21] <%notsoy> FF being fatal fury
[1:01:21] <Sol_Install> Like KOF?
[1:01:23] <%ThirdWelles> that's probably a dead accurate call

[1:01:53] <%JoshManVGH> Good ol Sixty-Nice Damage
[1:01:53] <+CptCreampuff16> @stevenellis386 im enjoying it a lot but im biased as im obsessed with any league lore
[1:01:54] <%ThirdWelles> Pat does the music sound intentionally fucky on your end?
[1:02:11] <jkfd> sounds like your record player is broken
[1:02:12] <%sleepystardewfarmer> this music is so good

[1:02:21] <ChaosedStar> Thaats miss fortunes passive
[1:02:21] <intestinal_bleeding> back when league's design had to appeal the coomiest of brains

[1:02:26] <%ThirdWelles> Oh my god MF has a sex appeal mechanic
[1:02:29] <%CalderGaming> that's a callback to her league skill
[1:02:29] <Frostydough1> @PatStaresAt strut is her passive w in LoL
[1:02:32] <%KineticZen> @ThirdWelles Sounds fine, you may just be in low latency mode trying to watch up
[1:02:35] <SaltyAzteca> LEO STRUT
[1:02:39] <%KineticZen> catch up*
[1:02:43] <Lunarclock> dont feed your laners after midnight
[1:02:48] <+PMAvers> I'm going to take a swing and  guess that Strut makes her go faster if she hasn't been attacked.
[1:02:52] <%PocketBearIllustrator> God, these animations are really good
[1:02:55] <+patel347> I think the abiliies have more text
[1:02:57] <cartakus> Nothing like a pirate with auto-guns
[1:02:59] <AvroEltz> KO? yeah right
[1:03:02] <%Logoth_> Its like Grandia's ATB
[1:03:03] <akitanito> is there an option to fast forward animation?

[1:04:04] <blazingorientel> It shows who they are targeting
[1:04:06] <%ThirdWelles> Symbol for who he's focusing
[1:04:07] <danraven> his guns did the talking
[1:04:08] <+Grifsor> sorry caps
[1:04:08] <+PMAvers> Guessing  that it's intent? Like he's going to attack that character?

[1:04:16] <Jontman42> he's saying something racist in all chat
[1:04:21] <+Ulf1863> you MUST spin your guns around after firing them
[1:04:24] <stevenellis386> welp, i didn't hate battlechasers...

[1:08:59] <LoudmicRPG> @PatStaresAt Did you see they just added huge PvE mode in Runeterra?
[1:08:59] <vegetablespy> They added kinda a single player in runeterra
[1:08:59] <T_Sasquatch> id play runeterra but I really dont want to deal with trying to get more cards
[1:09:00] <%Chichen> it super is
[1:09:04] <T_Sasquatch> im feeling the league itch tho
[1:09:05] <+polothegreatest> xD
[1:09:05] <%Ne1son> Arcane is really fucking good
[1:09:06] <+BigBruthaThunda> feels like its like 5 years too late
[1:09:07] <+MonocleGrizzly> I’m playing for the PvE mode tbh
[1:09:07] <MrDrayko> It's the trick blizzard had, before they set fire to themselves
[1:09:09] <+alphonseisbest> ITS REAL GOOD
[1:09:09] <+Mrbaconator> arcane is AMAZING
[1:09:10] <%RealThiele> yo whys the mist gotta be black

[1:09:21] <intestinal_bleeding> arcane definitely hits you with serotonin shots constantly
[1:09:23] <%captain_thickthighs> ive never touched any of these series so im free
[1:09:23] <LoudmicRPG> @PatStaresAt They also added big PvE mode to runeterra, like full PvE campaigns
[1:09:24] <+lucaflowe> This looks like a better Battlechasers
[1:09:26] <Sol_Install> It's SO GOOD
[1:09:28] <T_Sasquatch> arcane is unironic 10/0
[1:09:29] <%Logoth_> When's the fucking league fighting game
[1:09:29] <slatersev> Arcane's only compeititon when it comes to CGI is Spiderverse and like Clone Wars season 7

[1:09:45] <%ThirdWelles> ooo, UI sound design is nice
[1:09:46] <%chiazam> And all the episodes are out Saturday
[1:09:47] <%VictorVonLouche> Biggest issue with arcane is if you dont give any shits about Vi or Jinx its kinda bleh.
[1:09:47] <Dr00_PhD> you WHAY
[1:09:47] <+trackles_64> what's a pox cast?
[1:09:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pod cast sounds nerdy

[1:09:52] <%Skelefellah> SPOOKIES
[1:09:54] <+blaccbird914> blaccbird914 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[1:09:54] <vegetablespy> who cast?
[1:09:55] <LoudmicRPG> @PatStaresAt They also added big PvE mode to runeterra, like full PvE campaigns
[1:09:55] <%RealThiele> fortress superior animals
[1:09:55] <%Ne1son> CSB is only for fighting games
[1:09:55] <+alphonseisbest> WHATS IT CALLED? Kappa
[1:09:56] <%ConLin_Arts_> WutFace
[1:09:56] <%Rumbutt> Pat with his own cross-media campaign

[1:10:04] <%KilogramHours> YOU DO?
[1:10:05] <LorcaNomad> I like these ghost designs
[1:10:06] <Profmcstevie> You don't have a podcast, you turn up to the Kite and Fight Cast with Woolie
[1:10:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> Is that like a fishing thing?
[1:10:07] <%Chichen> the chewie and fuckface show right?
[1:10:07] <$realm_forge> HOLY SHIT YOU DO?
[1:10:11] <%ConLin_Arts_> g g g g ghosts
[1:10:12] <%MidnightBurst12> too bad the podcast was cancelled :(
[1:10:15] <MageSonic> where are you casting this pod?
[1:10:21] <%StebTheVee> StebTheVee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 13 month streak! It's been over a year since I subbed to you just to watch the Yakuza LAD vods. Btw, I played that GOTG game and as someone who had doubts and Marvel fatigue, game was good.
[1:10:24] <@Spydurman> yeah but update us here after you've watched it and Woolie hasn't so we can hear more about it
[1:10:30] <+patel347> its a nice twist on turn based combat
[1:10:39] <%Logoth_> I bounced off that too
[1:10:41] <+PMAvers> You know, I think Woolie might dig this?
[1:10:43] <MrDrayko> Nah just play this
[1:10:43] <@Spydurman> same
[1:10:47] <@goose_attack_almanac> This will be the same dungeon crawling probably.
[1:10:48] <%KineticZen> Actually new ideas coming out of Riot? This was developed by other people wasn't it
[1:10:48] <%RealThiele> nah
[1:10:48] <%bravebravesrobin> @patstaresat this music sounds a lot like Witcher 3 to you?
[1:10:53] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Battlechasers 2 died for this..  T__T
[1:10:53] <Sol_Install> I understand thaht
[1:10:53] <rusho> Absolutely try Battle Chasers again
[1:10:54] <stevenellis386> the game did kinda get boring after a while
[1:10:54] <+patel347> do a slow attack maybe?
[1:10:55] <redthebaron> i also bounced
[1:10:58] <+pectusumbra> need for speed
[1:11:01] <Sol_Install> I say it's worth another try again
[1:11:03] <Saltmeisterr> @KineticZen yep
[1:11:05] <Frostydough1> @Spydurman yupp this exactly if woolie hasnt seen it  then itll just be "yupp its good"
[1:11:06] <%RealThiele> it was very boardgame in its feel with travel
[1:11:09] <MrDrayko> I dropped BC on switch and this replaced it entirely for me
[1:11:09] <%JoshManVGH> I enjoyed the combat enough to keep playing Battle Chasers.
[1:11:12] <%MugenSandan> I heard Battle Chasers has too many random encounters for its own good
[1:11:14] <+alphonseisbest> @KineticZen Yes Riot ONLY published
[1:11:15] <slatersev> listen to that Gareth Coker ost
[1:11:17] <Sol_Install> I restarted and enjoy my second one better knowing whats to do better
[1:11:27] <@goose_attack_almanac> The other person poisoned you
[1:11:27] <scrumbotime> Pat can't read
[1:11:36] <cartakus> That Lies of P trailer is so weird
[1:11:38] <$realm_forge> Bullets. The well known weakness of all ghosts
[1:11:44] <vegetablespy> is this a full priced game or will they nickel and dime you?
[1:11:45] <+alphonseisbest> @MrDrayko oooh how is this on Switch, was thinking of picking it up there
[1:11:45] <%Paperware> No, you read it right, the lady ghost just has a poison attack
[1:11:46] <+FrenchTact1cs> Wtf is this Battle Chasers?
[1:11:51] <+CptCreampuff16> Inspect everythng
[1:11:55] <%RealThiele> I want lies of P to be good but im 90% sure it wont be
[1:11:56] <+patel347> yeah
[1:11:58] <DigiLapin> yes
[1:12:01] <$StrawberryPantsu> Mid is feed
[1:12:01] <MrDrayko> Yep
[1:12:01] <%StebTheVee> @PatStaresAt How much of a LoL fan are you? Or are you just trying out this game?
[1:12:01] <T_Sasquatch> @vegetablespy i think its 30 bucks
[1:12:01] <%VictorVonLouche> Seems so
[1:12:02] <%vice127> yes
[1:12:03] <+alphonseisbest> @cartakus APAB Kappa
[1:12:03] <+CptCreampuff16> yee
[1:12:07] <+pectusumbra> Seems like it
[1:12:08] <DigiLapin> as long as your icon isnt in the mist your good
[1:12:09] <cherrycottontail> @FrenchTact1cs Yes, sames devs as battlechasers and darksiders genesis
[1:12:12] <@goose_attack_almanac> @vegetablespy $40 CDN, no other fees unless you want some inconsequential bonus dlc
[1:12:15] <masterfire23> is that all this game is ? some kind of league of legends?
[1:12:22] <+lucaflowe> This kinda seems like Grandia's battle system with LoL lanes
[1:12:25] <%Monkeyweed21> PAT NO
[1:12:31] <+pectusumbra> because you got poisoned before
[1:12:33] <akitanito> you got poisoned from the attack
[1:12:35] <+patel347> I think the enemy hit you with poison
[1:12:35] <@goose_attack_almanac> The Ghost is stabbing you with poison knives
[1:12:38] <%vice127> the pirate poisoned you
[1:12:38] <%Monkeyweed21> oh it didnt kill
[1:12:39] <%Ne1son> The add poisioned you with an attack
[1:12:44] <%RealThiele> pre-poisoned
[1:12:45] <TheHeroAppears> are you getting your recommended amount of CS pat
[1:12:55] <+konekoryugamine> CS?
[1:12:55] <cartakus> I did not understand the APAB thing tbh
[1:13:04] <%Ne1son> League is a fun game
[1:13:09] <+konekoryugamine> Is this turn based?
[1:13:15] <AvroEltz> impossible, league bad
[1:13:18] <%VictorVonLouche> LoL is a good game, just shit players
[1:13:19] <%vice127> shoot the guy with your gun so you can initiate the combat
[1:13:23] <LoudmicRPG> League of Legends is poop. Legends of Runeterra, Teamfight Tactics and Ruined King are actually good
[1:13:25] <+pectusumbra> oh yeah, @PatStaresAt apparently there's going to be a world of horror update within like the next month or so?
[1:13:25] <Lunarclock> League sure is one of the video games ever
[1:13:27] <+alphonseisbest> @cartakus Oh as a black dude it FEELS out of place tbh
[1:13:28] <%KineticZen> It was the repetition for me
[1:13:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> no\
[1:13:30] <%RealThiele> Your Honor, League of Legends
[1:13:30] <%bevyrage> yeah you streamed battlechasers
[1:13:31] <+ALazo> I've been trying it out, but it feels like a waste playing it alone with randoms
[1:13:32] <+polothegreatest> its only fun with friends doodSad
[1:13:33] <Saltmeisterr> no
[1:13:37] <MrDrayko> it's the overworld interaction that's a snoozefest
[1:13:38] <Sol_Install> No
[1:13:43] <$StrawberryPantsu> You mean Battlechasers?
[1:13:47] <T_Sasquatch> i stopped playing legaue when i tried my ranked placements and realised my thousands of hours meant nothing and im a shit
[1:13:49] <@Spydurman> it's really repetitive, I gave up a few hours in
[1:13:52] <+alphonseisbest> @LoudmicRPG what IS TFT?
[1:13:53] <%Ne1son> @ALazo Playing with friends is an improvvement
[1:13:55] <@Spydurman> it's just bland
[1:13:56] <@goose_attack_almanac> I have fun playing League solo. But I also main top lane where I don't have to interact with my team at all
[1:14:01] <%KineticZen> Also you had Monika with barely any keyframes compared to other characters, which was a bummer
[1:14:03] <Sol_Install> Overworld was thte weak part
[1:14:04] <+konekoryugamine> My friend is in Silver right now in LoL
[1:14:08] <Sol_Install> but the fighting was fun
[1:14:26] <%RealThiele> ghost rat drowned
[1:14:26] <+konekoryugamine> He said he'd swap to Overwatch if he hadn't sunken so much time in League. Although right now, that's not much of an option.
[1:14:31] <Sol_Install> but there's a point it cranks up and that's when it turn into a grind for a bit
[1:14:36] <+polothegreatest> imagine being an support main doodSad
[1:15:00] <DigiLapin> KEKHeim
[1:15:02] <vegetablespy> My friends would grind gold 2 weeks befor the season closed and it was the most toxic my voice chat would become.
[1:15:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt I can admit to also feeling bored playing BattleChasers, combat included.   I was very excited about it when I was looking for new Switch games and I love the Joe Mad artstyle, but the game just didn't hold me
[1:15:11] <zerointelligence000> so having not seen any spoilers is this game invalidated due to that shitty Sentinels of Light event?
[1:15:13] <%KilogramHours> ALIEEEEN
[1:15:16] <MageSonic> speeed~ lytALRIGHT
[1:15:20] <%KilogramHours> its an AAYYYYLIEN

[1:15:39] <%KineticZen> That is an AYYYlien
[1:15:39] <LoudmicRPG> @LoudmicRPG its an auto-battle like Dota autochess
[1:15:41] <Sol_Install> that's some nice QL
[1:15:42] <+konekoryugamine> Dammit I don't want to get sucked in
[1:15:43] <%bevyrage> btw if anyone didn't know, the name 'Sarah' comes from 'princess' or 'woman of high ranking' so her name is Princess Fortune
[1:15:46] <TopTierHarley> majinoNeko

[1:39:50] <%ConLin_Arts_> Butler Juice?
[1:39:50] <sandwhichpeddler> I used to have a very wrinkled Pug so I know the feel of the face clean
[1:39:50] <+alphonseisbest> Does TFT have any lore/story? or is it ALL pvp?
[1:39:52] <%greasypete00> do bulldogs have butt juice?
[1:39:53] <LorcaNomad> what wipes do you use pat?
[1:39:54] <Zebroneath> no one likes butt juice
[1:40:28] <Visorak6> Thanks for reminding me I need to raise my ilvl
[1:40:31] <heartlesshealer> all dogs can have butt juice. Sometimes you gotta take them to the vet to express it if it gets real bad
[1:40:38] <akitanito> except for scat fetishist
[1:40:41] <heartlesshealer> it's why a dog will scoot across the floor
[1:40:41] <chumbv> Is this a game based on the popular Neflix show Arcane?
[1:40:42] <+smallboops> lmao dude literally tabbed out to set his retainers on hourlies
[1:40:43] <%BogBodyPositive> I'm so happy to see a dog owner finally actually WIPE those folds, so many people just, dont
[1:40:43] <%afronooch> cant relate
[1:41:04] <%AncelDeLambert> she's a bruiser, yeah
[1:41:08] <+alphonseisbest> Chat does TFT have any plot or story, or is all PVP?
[1:41:08] <%DEETRz> is pat enjoying this game so far?
[1:41:13] <%AncelDeLambert> if she doesn't get melted, she wins
[1:41:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> whip out your tents
[1:41:17] <%KilogramHours> Thats how she is like in League
[1:41:19] <+smallboops> AND IN THIS GAME THEY CANT KITE YOUR SLOW ASS
[1:41:23] <%MelBrooksKA> Wha happun to pirate lady?
[1:41:29] <chumbv> PVP only @alphonseisbest
[1:41:30] <someyounguy1> o neat i didntknow this was a game,  ithought it was a comic
[1:41:31] <Manwad> @alphonseisbest all pvp
[1:41:32] <bakkatohri> How hard is it for turn based games to have dynamic camera angles like in the original Final Fantasy PS1 games?
[1:41:34] <%BogBodyPositive> oh I see how that works now
[1:41:35] <%Ne1son> @alphonseisbest TFT is just autochess
[1:41:49] <+alphonseisbest> ah thx chat!
[1:41:53] <chumbv> I love tft though
[1:41:53] <Pyon84> So this is Battlechasers but painted in LoL right?
[1:41:55] <%Skelefellah> TFT has story
[1:41:59] <%Skelefellah> but only in the TFT-verse
[1:42:08] <%Skelefellah> You get it from the season trailers
[1:42:13] <heartlesshealer> did... cleanse even happen?
[1:42:31] <+alphonseisbest> @bakkatohri hardish, depends on the engine and the art style, and the budget, and the team, and the goal
[1:42:44] <%Skelefellah> Like last set the Black Mist basically made an evil Pengu that got destroyed across two set trailers
[1:42:51] <chumbv> SourPls
[1:43:08] <%KilogramHours> ill-oww-ee
[1:43:23] <TheoTTree> This game has some pretty bangin music
[1:43:24] <bakkatohri> @alphonseisbest Right has to be making more money than back in the PS1 days though, right?
[1:43:26] <Pyon84> Has pat given his thoughts on this yet?
[1:43:28] <bakkatohri> Riot*
[1:43:34] <%Skelefellah> LUL
[1:43:34] <Arqartur0> she looks badass
[1:43:37] <%Skelefellah> Super descriptive
[1:44:09] <+alphonseisbest> @bakkatohri Yea but they didn't make this, only published, and we don't know how much they gave the studio
[1:44:10] <heartlesshealer> please tell me the upgrade is to the percentage of tentacle summon
[1:44:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> lifesteal in a turn based JRPG?  that seems rare now a days
[1:44:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> as a built in stat
[1:44:18] <MrGuy516> wait is this just indivisible with a LoL paintjob?
[1:44:21] <Arqartur0> Dong Dong?
[1:44:33] <bakkatohri> @alphonseisbest Yeah, that makes sense.
[1:44:35] <+SuperFightinRobot> Are we salty yet?
[1:44:36] <LoneFonte> don't think so?
[1:44:38] <MrDrayko> not yet
[1:44:41] <MyNameIsRasus> you're not level 6 yet so Kappa
[1:44:47] <%Skelefellah> @MrGuy516 If you mean Battle Chasers Nightwar with a LoL paintjob, then yes!
[1:44:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @MrGuy516 not even remotely.  Indivisible is Valkryie Profile battle system
[1:45:04] <Pyon84> @MrGuy516 That's what I thought
[1:45:07] <+Queen_Grimlock> so is this just darkest dungeon but league
[1:45:19] <+alphonseisbest> @MrGuy516 AND U WILL PAY $30 FOR IT LUL
[1:45:21] <kruphix92> ultimate unlocks later for story reasons
[1:45:25] <Arqartur0> @MrGuy516 No, this is Wasteland 2 with a Riot paintjob
[1:45:25] <heartlesshealer> okay, branched upgrades is fine
[1:45:25] <+smallboops> so this is just videogame plus videogame
[1:45:25] <MyNameIsRasus> darkest jungle mains
[1:45:42] <MyNameIsRasus> darkest soloque
[1:45:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> strangely, Battle Chasers was also a $30 game
[1:45:59] <Arqartur0> @MyNameIsRasus Darkest Gank
[1:46:15] <+Mythicalbrit> Thats why they deal such low damage tentacles deal true damage so they ignore defense
[1:46:16] <$realm_forge> Pat can speak Italian?!
[1:46:16] <MyNameIsRasus> "Many fall in the face of all chat. But not this one. Not today"
[1:46:21] <%KetsuoTaberu> is Pat saying words
[1:46:31] <heartlesshealer> more or always, more or faster, more or summon heal
[1:46:34] <%Chichen> @realm_forge his italian is really good
[1:46:36] <heartlesshealer> these sound fun
[1:46:37] <akitanito> I heard words but I have no idea what was said
[1:46:41] <%Paperware> Literally the first thing I did
[1:46:46] <+ALazo> Why?
[1:46:47] <+SuperFightinRobot> Big mood
[1:46:50] <+smallboops> @realm_forge LUL
[1:46:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> get that luck outta here
[1:46:52] <sirtommygunn> its a good idea
[1:46:53] <zerointelligence000> Pat is learning to speak english
[1:46:57] <%KineticZen> Kinda wish they'd named the upgrades instead of "1A/1B"
[1:47:00] <%DEETRz> i too like making 100% tentacles
[1:47:01] <heartlesshealer> same
[1:47:04] <+polothegreatest> healer? level that sht LUL
[1:47:05] <akitanito> RNG sucks
[1:47:08] <Arqartur0> So basically push it all into Strength
[1:47:13] <Arqartur0> No Luck
[1:47:23] <Visorak6> Like 350% crits?
[1:47:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Battle Chasers is also a different price across platforms. it's STILL $40 on Switch but 30 on Xbox and PSN (and currently it's literally 6 bucks on PSN)
[1:47:28] <$realm_forge> His English sucks but yeah his Italian is amazing!
[1:47:34] <sirtommygunn> proc or crit builds can be annoying
[1:47:35] <+SuperFightinRobot> I feel that.
[1:47:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> 1% chance of an instant kill, but no damage otherwise
[1:47:53] <+SuperFightinRobot> How did Pat like leveling Dancer?
[1:47:56] <heartlesshealer> like if it were chance to max out your tentacles or always summon one on hit that would be a harder choice
[1:47:58] <MyNameIsRasus> "Monstrous creep score has no intrinsic merit. Unless inordinate shut downs be considered a virtue"
[1:47:58] <Arqartur0> DEMACIA
[1:48:04] <+smallboops> pat would you take 10% crit chance or 2.5% dmg increase?
[1:48:08] <TheoTTree> This ambient music is reminding me of Disco Elysium in places
[1:48:08] <+Queen_Grimlock> DEMACIA
[1:48:18] <+alphonseisbest> who's writing those?
[1:48:18] <+Queen_Grimlock> @smallboops easily the crit chance
[1:48:19] <+WarbossMetal> Hmm, Battle-chasers Nightwar
[1:48:39] <zerointelligence000> can't wait for the entry where we find out Elise fucking eats him
[1:48:51] <jellssssss20> Wait is this game good?
[1:48:56] <MyNameIsRasus> SALT AND BRINE
[1:49:08] <+SuperFightinRobot> Depends what the crit damage is
[1:49:09] <sirtommygunn> make Nautilus playable
[1:49:16] <+alphonseisbest> @jellssssss20 so far yea
[1:49:16] <Zalthia> Isn't Nautalis in Lore Limbo right now?
[1:49:17] <MyNameIsRasus> Man I want Riot to make more LOL things that aren't LOL so i can enjoy LOL without playing LOL
[1:49:22] <+smallboops> this is a shockingly clean equipment menu
[1:49:23] <+SuperFightinRobot> I believe in the law of averages
[1:49:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I feel like if a game is 6 bucks on sale, that tells you what the publisher thinks of the game
[1:49:26] <LoneFonte> MONEY
[1:49:32] <+alphonseisbest> @MyNameIsRasus THIS
[1:49:34] <TheoTTree> You seen any of Arcane, Pat?
[1:49:36] <Visorak6> Thank you money
[1:49:36] <sirtommygunn> Isn't everyone in lore limbo at all times with LoL?
[1:49:38] <+polothegreatest> nautilus big daddy
[1:49:40] <$Sdeje> You run faster if you click the right stick
[1:49:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> unless it's like a BC old game from generations ago
[1:49:41] <+alphonseisbest> i love money
[1:49:42] <stevenellis386> thats realistic
[1:49:47] <zerointelligence000> Riot is basically alt blizz
[1:49:51] <%BinaryFireball> Riot IS alternate universe Blizzard
[1:49:56] <+alphonseisbest> FUCK BIZARD
[1:49:58] <%Ne1son> Man I really love League
[1:49:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Blizzard at home
[1:50:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> MANY games are Alt-Blilzzard
[1:50:07] <%dekkitout> Again, lowercase b Blizzard
[1:50:08] <MrDrayko> Rito is just Blizzard II
[1:50:12] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> What kind of game is this I cant tell?
[1:50:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Grim Dawn,Torchlight
[1:50:25] <+polothegreatest> Sona is just a rich mute musician. or they change that?
[1:50:26] <+emperri> you will be granted Ed Boon
[1:50:27] <+alphonseisbest> Bilzzard without the R**e
[1:50:28] <+cubbywolf> is it just me or are 'blizzard' style games out of touch and dated?
[1:50:29] <+Queen_Grimlock> SHUT UP AND JAM BUT IT'S LEAGUE
[1:50:36] <MyNameIsRasus> Oh this song SourPls
[1:50:41] <zerointelligence000> is this a full lp or one off?
[1:50:52] <%JoshManVGH> What is Riot but an alternate universes Blizzard. weird that its just as shitty a company... anyway back to capitalism!
[1:50:53] <Arqartur0> FF14 is just WoW with the number's filled off (obvious troll)
[1:50:59] <%KineticZen> Original Diablo 1/2 are still timeless
[1:51:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I love(d) Blizzard, but it feels like a lot of people LEAVE and do their own thing
[1:51:07] <%GodDougle> GodDougle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 12 month streak! 
[1:51:08] <+WarbossMetal> Hmmm, even more Battle-chasers nightwar
[1:51:08] <%Ne1son> Passive?
[1:51:11] <%BinaryFireball> @JoshManVGH too true lol
[1:51:13] <+pectusumbra> crit I guess?
[1:51:16] <sirtommygunn> proc
[1:51:16] <akitanito> I think they just count as one
[1:51:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that is just more of what they were going at Blizzard
[1:51:20] <mr_sups> Riot is Blizz from 20 years ago transported to modern day
[1:51:24] <%BinaryFireball> it is very battlechaser isnt it
[1:51:36] <BreakfastSampler> @BinaryFireball same dev
[1:51:38] <sirtommygunn> how long until these backup dancers are replaced by actual party members
[1:51:39] <%MelBrooksKA> Guys, Riot isn't alternate universe Blizzard, it's in the same universe
[1:51:46] <+alphonseisbest> @mr_sups Lets hope they don't End the same way
[1:51:47] <+emperri> gwent-ass battle music
[1:51:48] <%BinaryFireball> oooo
[1:51:50] <MyNameIsRasus> go herald then Kappa
[1:51:52] <$realm_forge> This soundtrack makes me want to get rum drunk and watch the first pirates of the Caribbean
[1:51:53] <%Ne1son> @PatStaresAt Your passive gave you one and the smash gave you one
[1:51:57] <bakkatohri> @JoshManVGH Blizzard hasn't been good since they got involved with Activision
[1:52:02] <+Queen_Grimlock> tentacles
[1:52:02] <Blu_C> "Man, I love this tentacle shit." -Pat 11/17/2021
[1:52:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I mean a lot of people leave Blizzard and make Blizzard games without Blizzard
[1:52:35] <%MelBrooksKA> @bakkatohri They were bad before that
[1:52:38] <MonsieurHedge> did they change illaoi's voice actress from the league of legends one?
[1:52:50] <%cooldude69xx> @mr_sups They're already on the way internally
[1:53:07] <MyNameIsRasus> man say what you want about blizzard but it's really cool how the ceo went to woolievs to play dokapon
[1:53:12] <slatersev> Blizzard has been owned by others there entire history
[1:53:18] <ape_hawk> tentacles have a way of doing that
[1:53:26] <Arqartur0> Which Company made the Torchlight games?
[1:53:34] <sirtommygunn> they probably prioritize your last target then split any overkill to next target in line
[1:53:40] <MrDrayko> Runic Games
[1:53:41] <%amaranthos> amaranthos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:53:44] <SrHassan> good soundtrack
[1:53:52] <moondog_> moondog_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 25 months of orb-man and moostard queen...no complaints only abject desire for more
[1:54:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Arqartur0 made or published?  the team was former Diablo devs
[1:54:09] <JohnJackJohnson> Has Pat watched or mentioned Arcane?
[1:54:12] <zerointelligence000> Illaoi doing all the work
[1:54:26] <Calek> Arcane is pretty dang rad
[1:54:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I forgot the Grim Dawn is also former Blizzard devs
[1:54:54] <+emperri> because there's a cap on tentacles
[1:54:56] <akitanito> big miss
[1:54:56] <Onatamana> YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL TENTACLES
[1:54:57] <MonsieurHedge> i mean that's how her kit works in League, which is a nice touch
[1:55:02] <Arqartur0> @Arqartur0 Published/made, and yeah, they also got the Diablo model and got it good... Haven't played Torchlight 3, though
[1:55:18] <+Prinnylordninjocity> Achieve tentacle limit
[1:55:24] <+PMAvers> Maybe a healing potion?\
[1:55:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I don't believe Path of Exile is related to Blizzard, but I wouldn't be shocked
[1:55:35] <Arqartur0> Become a Hentai monster, Pat
[1:55:39] <MonsieurHedge> well, illy is a big hero lady and the rest are goobers, so
[1:55:40] <sirtommygunn> I'm like 95% sure they arent real party members
[1:55:41] <$Sdeje> I like the battle music
[1:55:42] <Onatamana> the other guys don't carry huge brass idols
[1:55:49] <zerointelligence000> that's why Pyke is totally going to kill them and ahri and yasuo join
[1:55:51] <sirtommygunn> gonna be replaced after the tutorial dungeon
[1:55:52] <Visorak6> Probably a good time to pot
[1:55:55] <sirtommygunn> i bet
[1:56:04] <%topendbuzza> so what kind of game is this?
[1:56:04] <+WarbossMetal> Well theres a reason those two goobers aren't playable in league
[1:56:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Arqartur0 I don't know about that or at least I personally didn't quite feel like Torchlight 2 was very fun to play for long periods of time and I dropped it and Torchlight 3 (which was on Game Pass)
[1:56:33] <Arqartur0> Man, haven't played League in AGES
[1:56:36] <akitanito> you know they are bad when their animations are worse than the enemy mooks
[1:56:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> now Grim Dawn FELT like Diablo
[1:56:48] <MonsieurHedge> @topendbuzza cool turn based RPG by the looks of things
[1:56:49] <nintega010> Gangplank has good taste in women. Since him and Illaoi used to be married
[1:56:52] <+WarbossMetal> turn based single player rpg
[1:56:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I can't wait for the Grim Dawn CONSOLE launch in a few weeks
[1:57:02] <MonsieurHedge> were they MARRIED or just FUCKING
[1:57:07] <+polothegreatest> why no faster summoner rift mode NotLikeThis
[1:57:25] <ape_hawk> save pots
[1:57:35] <zerointelligence000> funny how this game looks more fun to play than lol LUL
[1:57:38] <MyNameIsRasus> @polothegreatest ain't that just wild rift
[1:57:39] <nintega010> @monsieurhedge they were married. Divorced cause of her religion
[1:57:47] <Arqartur0> The Last time I played LoL, Jynx was announced.
[1:57:49] <%thedankestmeeme> IT DOES BTW
[1:57:53] <+theajones53> when did this game come out
[1:57:54] <%thedankestmeeme> ooops caps
[1:57:58] <%topendbuzza> that's because lol is a bad game
[1:58:07] <MonsieurHedge> wow gp's a bitch for divorcing her then, she's worth it
[1:58:08] <%thedankestmeeme> wait
[1:58:09] <+emperri> I think it is
[1:58:10] <%thedankestmeeme> nvm
[1:58:10] <%Ne1son> Lol is great
[1:58:12] <Arqartur0> she big
[1:58:12] <+polothegreatest> but all skins and champ are gone tho doodSad
[1:58:18] <Pyon84> If it's like Battle Chasers Nightwar they will have different outfits for certain armor.
[1:58:24] <JohnJackJohnson> league is the worst part of league even if its not that bad tbh
[1:58:28] <%thedankestmeeme> weapons do
[1:58:33] <%thedankestmeeme> not cloths i guess
[1:58:38] <nintega010> @monsieurhedge nah they had a mutual break up
[1:58:41] <vegetablespy> I stopped playing lol about the time. Zoe was announced
[1:58:41] <JohnJackJohnson> it's really weird to see how everything else riot is putting out is just worlds above
[1:58:42] <MonsieurHedge> literal bonfire
[1:58:45] <MyNameIsRasus> IS THIS A GUMBO GAME
[1:58:47] <Onatamana> LoL is great. It's just shit because of the people who play it, nullifying everything that makes it great.
[1:58:48] <Arqartur0> Is the League communty still shit?
[1:58:51] <$Sdeje> they have skins that change the look
[1:58:53] <%Monkeyweed21> @JohnJackJohnson Riot is the worst part of League
[1:58:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @theajones53 apparently yesterday
[1:58:55] <luftraumm1> i gotta be honest this power grab by riot seems to be really well thought out, they need very little more to dominate games
[1:58:57] <%MugenSandan> THE DARK SOULS OF NFNSOFUEVDIFKSB
[1:58:58] <vegetablespy> yes
[1:59:02] <%Ne1son> What community isnt shit
[1:59:03] <MonsieurHedge> @Arqartur0 like, top 10 shittiest ever
[1:59:04] <%blastyoboots> bonfires are a great concept that games copied because they're fucking genius

[2:03:33] <%JoshManVGH> I like it when gods show characters the script
[2:03:33] <MonsieurHedge> nagakaborous is a stupid sea snake illaoi, she has no actual idea what is going on
[2:03:35] <Arqartur0> Wait... Gangplank was a pirate, now he is THAT!?
[2:03:38] <%MugenSandan> She's trying to show you that you can't bypass Int checks just because you have 20 strength
[2:03:43] <+PMAvers> She needs a support that'll help the carries get tfed.
[2:03:45] <JohnJackJohnson> I'm half ashamed to admit I have 600k mastery on this man so loving that he's getting the love he deserves in stories

[2:05:32] <Arqartur0> @bakkatohri ooooh
[2:05:39] <Frostydough1> just like religion~
[2:05:41] <MonsieurHedge> well pyke's mostly saltwater and murderous rage, which actually checks out on the whole nagakaborous thing
[2:05:43] <JohnJackJohnson> @zerointelligence000 I'm hoping for Pyke and MF, both have a massive vengeance boner
[2:05:45] <Onatamana> So Illaoi's whole religion is basically YOLO?
[2:05:46] <Ipsenscastle> oh my god this fucking dialogue is going in infinite circles
[2:05:51] <%CalderGaming> "just go with it lol"
[2:05:51] <ape_hawk> nah, pykes just that cool
[2:05:53] <Kinteka> I mean LoL is stupid BS
[2:06:03] <%Dakuu75> @Onatamana basically
[2:06:09] <arronash91> Is this from Epic store or steam?
[2:06:10] <+Ez3z> one of Aurelion Sol's lines for Illaoi is basically "lol you dont understand your god at all"
[2:06:15] <nintega010> @onatamana the strongest survives
[2:06:19] <MrDrayko> I thought we covered this in Dark Souls Pat, fantasy religion stops being dumb when it lets you toss energy at people
[2:06:20] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[2:06:21] <LoneFonte> @arronash91 this is on steam
[2:06:22] <Arqartur0> LoL is someone's dnd campaign setting
[2:06:23] <%tank7013> What if the goddess only favored Pyke just to troll Illaoi because she was bored
[2:06:28] <%TotesBurger> God I love Joe Mad's art style
[2:06:37] <MyNameIsRasus> I saw a leveled up Viego getting my units elder
[2:06:42] <MyNameIsRasus> you don't understand
[2:06:42] <TheHeroAppears> I don't get any of pat's runeterra references :)
[2:06:43] <Tempmael> illaoi wants to run it down mid after whiffing ult on pkye
[2:06:52] <%amaranthos> I hear giefy
[2:06:53] <MonsieurHedge> @tank7013 the goddess is literally a really big nonsapient sea serpent, these people are crazy
[2:06:54] <+PMAvers> "Find a bad dude, punch it."
[2:06:59] <%amaranthos> psaDogchamp
[2:07:13] <+emperri> pairk
[2:07:18] <%Dakuu75> her WHOLE religion is based on the OPPOSITE of patience, literally
[2:07:21] <Arqartur0> psaFist
[2:07:22] <%topendbuzza> this dialogue is giving me diablo 3 flashbacks
[2:07:27] <+theajones53> every god needs to stop with cryptic visions just say what you want
[2:07:31] <MonsieurHedge> Peter Pyker, Fisher-Man (respect the hyphen)
[2:07:32] <MessyBristles> But elder all he does is steal the ADC's kills and does nothing of benefit to the team

[2:08:25] <%MidnightBurst12> why not
[2:08:26] <%tank7013> @MonsieurHedge As devout religious worshippers that kill in the name of their god usually are
[2:08:27] <Frostydough1> to show them gratitude for helping him @PatStaresAt :D
[2:08:29] <Arqartur0> @MonsieurHedge No, they must never nut!
[2:08:29] <Zalthia> Braum theme!

[2:08:56] <+Lord0Mugen> @PatStaresAt Just got off work. how are you enjoying the game? I loved Battle Chasers and this just seems like a better version of that.
[2:08:57] <TheSaltminer> yep, more or less
[2:08:57] <+Urgotfantasy> Braum is the BEST
[2:08:57] <%Treuan> He really is
[2:08:57] <zerointelligence000> yeah he is

[2:09:28] <slatersev> Its JB Blanc
[2:09:29] <KaitlynnHere> Come here boy!
[2:09:34] <%AncelDeLambert> Braum is so strong and cool that he punched through a MOUNTAIN to save a trapped child
[2:09:34] <foxenco> basically nordic kamen rider
[2:09:36] <Arqartur0> It's Fantasy Magi-tech Russia!
[2:09:36] <arkv01> mmmm yes musclemommy water
[2:09:36] <JohnJackJohnson> Illaoi literally has a line for braum that goes something like "Finally, a man who won't break." She's looking to smash a bit too literally
[2:09:37] <MyNameIsRasus> HE RAFTED ACROOS THE WORLD
[2:09:39] <+alphonseisbest> T-T THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IM SEEING BRUM BUT I LOVE HIM
[2:09:39] <ExpressNode> Twitch sure as been on a ads binge lately
[2:09:39] <MyNameIsRasus> CHAD
[2:09:41] <slatersev> also the guy who voiced Vander in Arcane
[2:09:42] <Zalthia> Braum fights with a door, because once he rescued a child from a magical ruin and had to dig down to the inside of a mountain. He took the door from the inside of the ruin, because it was enchanted to be unbreakable.
[2:09:46] <%Dakuu75> didn't the blessed isles turn into the place where thresh and all the undead live?
[2:09:53] <%dekkitout> 4 da keedz
[2:09:54] <Crouton18> Well maybe yorick will be in it now with the water
[2:09:54] <%Paperware> Kids got a cold? Time to fight some ghosts!
[2:09:57] <Frostydough1> @PatStaresAt when he feeds a poro a poro snack in ARAM they gain a moustache like him
[2:09:59] <MonsieurHedge> when's Yorick
[2:10:00] <%Ne1son> God I love Braum
[2:10:03] <%Dakuu75> his theme is dope
[2:10:03] <%MelBrooksKA> *sees clear viking/nordic iconography* "Clearly russian"

[2:10:06] <+Lord0Mugen> FOR THE POROS!
[2:10:08] <%notsoy> dhalgief
[2:10:09] <TheSaltminer> @Dakuu75 yep
[2:10:10] <Arqartur0> Didn't also Sagat do it for the Children?
[2:10:12] <arkv01> hes so BIG
[2:10:14] <Visorak6> Is braum just "lmao but do it tho"
[2:10:14] <Zalthia> Ha ha Riot doesn't remember Yorick :(
[2:10:16] <%AncelDeLambert> yep
[2:10:18] <jorniev> HOROSHO RAIDEN
[2:10:18] <%AncelDeLambert> it's the coolest
[2:10:18] <%Ne1son> Yeah they do
[2:10:25] <TheoTTree> The heart is the strongest muscle
[2:10:25] <MonsieurHedge> OH NO HE LOST HIS DOOR???
[2:10:29] <TheSaltminer> King did it for the children too
[2:10:30] <slatersev> Nothing you said was an actual word
[2:10:39] <+emperri> why do the children keep commissioning villains to do their dirty work
[2:10:42] <+superchronicc> Sagat got humbled and now is a hero to the children
[2:10:43] <akitanito> now he has a barrel as a shield
[2:10:45] <%Ne1son> Oh man that Art for Braum is super strong
[2:10:46] <Zalthia> Poro friend!!!
[2:10:46] <arronash91> Nooo the DOOR!?!?
[2:10:49] <Arqartur0> Doing it the Children is the biggest Buff
[2:10:49] <jorniev> BEEF
[2:10:52] <+PMAvers> "It was black, and it was a mist... so, maybe?"
[2:10:53] <+theajones53> I known braum for about 2 minutes and he is already my favorite character
[2:10:54] <theanora1> So Ryu Shoryukened the charity out of Sagat?
[2:10:55] <+Lord0Mugen> @TheSaltminer King did it sohedoesntdodrugsandalcohol
[2:11:00] <Mr_Rakjo> YEs
[2:11:00] <+WarbossMetal> Yes
[2:11:02] <+CptCreampuff16> yes
[2:11:02] <MonsieurHedge> like 90% of his powers are that door
[2:11:03] <SrHassan> yes
[2:11:04] <%Dakuu75> lol
[2:11:06] <TheoTTree> I mean his door is super special so
[2:11:07] <Mr_Rakjo> The Shield door is OP as balls
[2:11:08] <$realm_forge> BROM WILL MAKE SNU SNU WITH MUSCLE WOMAN THINK OF THE STORIES
[2:11:09] <%Ne1son> Yes the shield is too strong
[2:11:09] <TheSaltminer> @MonsieurHedge the game has unique weapon models, there are MANY doors
[2:11:10] <Arqartur0> yup
[2:11:10] <MrDrayko> Absolutely
[2:11:16] <TheoTTree> Other than the door he's just a big strong dude
[2:11:17] <+Lord0Mugen> @TheSaltminer and also because his brother Armor ing would beat his ass.
[2:11:18] <+CptCreampuff16> his og shield is magic and invunerable
[2:11:21] <arronash91> Yes
[2:11:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I didn't know Braum existed before and now i want to know everything about him. WOOF
[2:11:30] <AngryAsian5> Thanks Braum
[2:11:31] <+FerdytheNerdy> Si
[2:11:33] <+alphonseisbest> @realm_forge think of their CHILDREN!!!
[2:11:33] <nintega010> @monsieurhedge yes, but also he is really strong himself
[2:11:34] <+coldsama> yes this guy punches mountain to dust just to prove a point
[2:11:35] <%Dakuu75> I thought in league-lore the black mist returned every year on halloween
[2:11:36] <Onatamana> Braum and Illaoi slept together once. There were no survivors.
[2:11:40] <%bevyrage> To let peeps know what Braum is personality wise: He got his unbreakable door because a child was stuck on the other side while a monster was outside. So Braum punched his way through the mountainside to get into the chamber, save the child, ripped the door off its hinges from inside, then beat the monster outside to death with the door.
[2:11:41] <%chiazam> Yes
[2:11:47] <+alphonseisbest> @ShinobiPhoenix RIGHT!
[2:11:48] <jorniev> HE WAS CARRYING that fuck off Big sea monster
[2:11:51] <arkv01> haha dumb muscleman now kiss
[2:11:55] <MonsieurHedge> @nintega010 sure but all the ice magic shit he does is Door Juice

[2:12:04] <+WarbossMetal> Door mains
[2:12:20] <+theajones53> @bevyrage that is badass
[2:12:20] <%RetroCop87> what if Fortune's name was Karen?
[2:12:21] <LorcaNomad> i know right it's silly
[2:12:23] <+alphonseisbest> OK Patrick
[2:12:24] <+Lord0Mugen> @bevyrage AH! So he has a "smashing board". ;)
[2:12:24] <Arqartur0> Que Sera, Sera
[2:12:24] <+emperri> I can't believe her real last name is fortune
[2:12:27] <$realm_forge> The Muscles must kiss
[2:12:31] <ape_hawk> what name would you give Miss Fortune, pat?
[2:12:31] <arkv01> hey man you got a problem with sarah connor?
[2:12:32] <Zalthia> Braum is also implied to be an IceBorn
[2:12:33] <%chiazam> @bevyrage that’s some folklore shit
[2:12:34] <+alphonseisbest> HE THICC
[2:12:38] <%NopeBadguy> please tell me my boi gangplank is playable
[2:12:39] <Sternieliscious> Needs big arms to carry that cutie on the shoulder.
[2:12:41] <akitanito> Runeterra curse continues

[2:12:43] <%cooldude69xx> @ape_hawk PAige
[2:12:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> he probably has big something else
[2:12:43] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> BRAUM THE GOAT
[2:12:44] <mike2hands> What if it was paige?

[2:13:01] <%Dakuu75> I tried using him in top lane before... didn't work out lol
[2:13:08] <ape_hawk> guys, mf cant be paige because mf kills dudes, not women
[2:13:09] <%chiazam> THE BUFF MAN DOLES OUT BUFFS
[2:13:11] <+PMAvers> So he's going to want to use Lane abilities for that passive damage reduction?
[2:13:12] <%chiazam> who knew
[2:13:14] <%NopeBadguy> did you see the goddamn xiv cookbook has an ex trial
[2:13:21] <MonsieurHedge> @Dakuu75 needed more attack speed, he's surprisingly good
[2:13:22] <+alphonseisbest> @Kyma1020 Minsc is NOWHERE near that big
[2:13:23] <TheSaltminer> Braum's Concussion + Illaoi's tentacle hits = stack concussions quickly
[2:13:29] <$realm_forge> THE MUSCLES MUST KISS
[2:13:41] <GeoGio3> have you watched arcane Pat?
[2:13:44] <pomki20> whats with the audio
[2:13:45] <ExpressNode> Is this game an offshoot of something?
[2:13:49] <+Lord0Mugen> What do yall think of the game?
[2:13:52] <MyNameIsRasus> they increase the damage of your damage spells
[2:13:52] <Sydin18> wait, is this like a new game or something?
[2:14:04] <+alphonseisbest> ITS GOOD
[2:14:10] <+Toshatron> Arcane is very good, but I already love Piltover&Zaun lore
[2:14:12] <+Lord0Mugen> its a lore game
[2:14:14] <%chiazam> @geogio3 he’s going to
[2:14:14] <Visorak6> Says pat as he loads a handgun
[2:14:15] <Dio_TR> It gud
[2:14:17] <%bevyrage> yeah it's a new game
[2:14:20] <%bevyrage> release today i think
[2:14:23] <+Lord0Mugen> by the guys who made Battle Chasers
[2:14:27] <+Thyzoon> If they nail the final batch of episodes, it just might be my favorite show from 2021
[2:14:33] <+Thyzoon> it's THAT good
[2:14:39] <MonsieurHedge> illaoi would absolutely beat this dude's ass for not doing it himself
[2:14:45] <%bevyrage> barrel pat
[2:14:47] <%bevyrage> psaBlind
[2:14:48] <GarbageNirvana> Hi, I'm Lenny, this is Carl and Homer
[2:14:51] <MyNameIsRasus> is this game actually huge?
[2:15:09] <Hmhya> i like trains
[2:15:15] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> man the sentinels of light event sucked
[2:15:23] <Madinki> Keep telling someone to watch Arcane.......they will then proceed to NEVER watch Arcane.
[2:15:23] <GeoGio3> i like turtles
[2:15:26] <+Lord0Mugen> clickity clack down the track
[2:15:30] <+Toshatron> Arcane is my #2 only because Megalobox 2 was this year
[2:15:32] <MonsieurHedge> @A_DEAD_SHOW and it is now officially completely noncanon, iirc
[2:15:36] <+FerdytheNerdy> I like trains
[2:15:39] <%bevyrage> mmm pyrofluid bevyraSip
[2:15:42] <MonsieurHedge> the events of this game are canon and Sentinels of Light is not
[2:15:50] <+CptCreampuff16> what does aliasing do?
[2:16:00] <%thedankestmeeme> NO DIlly Dally
[2:16:07] <+MonocleGrizzly> @toshatron yeah Megalobox S2 was fantastic
[2:16:08] <MonsieurHedge> @CptCreampuff16 smoothes out the pixel jaggies
[2:16:09] <%Dakuu75> isn't anti-aliasing always good to have? helps prevent pop-in or something?
[2:16:09] <sirrice77> @CptCreampuff16 is aliases
[2:16:14] <$realm_forge> Essence restores youth and vitality to the Skeksis
[2:16:14] <%amaranthos> squeek
[2:16:14] <+SaphronBlackbourne> @CptCreampuff16 Reduced jagged edges on models
[2:16:15] <sirrice77> it*
[2:16:16] <slatersev> @MonsieurHedge Well, Viego getting beat by the Sentinels is still on that timeline
[2:16:17] <%amaranthos> psaDogchamp
[2:16:20] <+uberspeedster> Is this game like Diablo?
[2:16:22] <ape_hawk> pat, upgrade braum
[2:16:24] <+PMAvers> Oh hey, Braum has upgrade points.
[2:16:34] <+SaphronBlackbourne> It's not Diablo
[2:16:35] <bakkatohri> @Dakuu75 Anti-aliasing just makes things less jaggy
[2:16:37] <+Toshatron> @MonocleGrizzly So good it made the first series into a prequel for a much better show
[2:16:39] <+pectusumbra> @uberspeedster no, it's a turn based rpg
[2:16:40] <%bevyrage> @CptCreampuff16 so aliasing is when there's a hard distinction between the edges of a model and its surroundings. like a digital clock is an aliased image. anti-aliasing blurs the line and makes it blend in easier
[2:16:40] <slatersev> But "How" had probably been made non canon
[2:16:41] <MonsieurHedge> BAUM???
[2:16:43] <bakkatohri> @Dakuu75 Sometimes you don't even notice it
[2:16:54] <%ThirdWelles> What the hell are you calling Braum?
[2:16:56] <karl_rex> bowm?
[2:17:05] <thewrathofscience> Gief: How dare you take my ability to make annoying high pitch noises
[2:17:10] <%Dakuu75> @bakkatohri oh, I see
[2:17:23] <+alphonseisbest> OK i just seen the MIGHY PORO card WTF WHY IS IT SO CUTE!
[2:17:29] <%amaranthos> psaBig psaDogchamp
[2:17:33] <+PMAvers> So if  something's stun immune it just does more damage to compensate.
[2:18:29] <%ThirdWelles> Did you call Braum "Browm"?
[2:18:36] <Daxalog> Back in time?
[2:18:36] <Visorak6> Speed in initiative order pat
[2:18:36] <ape_hawk> Hit The Back
[2:18:38] <+PMAvers> Guessing on the timeline so they act later?
[2:18:38] <Visorak6> Its a delay
[2:18:39] <Hmhya> on the timeline?
[2:18:42] <asagi_ryuu> pushes them back on the turns?
[2:18:43] <noddy182> It might push them back along the "lane"?
[2:18:45] <%Paperware> pushes their turn back
[2:18:45] <%amaranthos> psaDogchamp psaMenace
[2:19:12] <%Dakuu75> @ThirdWelles it was definitely on purpose
[2:19:20] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat Just came in. How is the game so far?
[2:19:39] <%Dakuu75> sounds liek the opposite of league
[2:20:12] <asagi_ryuu> excited for Nioh stream on Friday, love those games

[2:20:51] <Onatamana> oh no. SIDEQUESTS
[2:21:01] <%Dakuu75> I alwayse regret not being able to finish Nioh. but, the combat and enemy type just got repetetive for me
[2:21:05] <ExpressNode> I might get Nioh collection for PS5, still haven't gotten a PS5 game since I've gotten it
[2:21:22] <+PMAvers> Might just be using the same UI as a normal store
[2:21:26] <MonsieurHedge> my kitten has arrives in the room and is meowing at me.
[2:22:01] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> The Star on the map is the Quest location

[2:25:45] <%RaziWraith> Boss looks like he's straight out the Stockades LUL
[2:25:50] <senfood> This dude looks Deadmines as hell.
[2:25:55] <%ThirdWelles> Well, we know where character design resources DIDN'T get allocated
[2:26:01] <+alphonseisbest> Chat was Joe mad an artist before wow came out?
[2:26:10] <jorniev> is more kaiser still cool?
[2:26:18] <+PMAvers> It did seem to have some hints to where he's hiding in the text therer.
[2:26:36] <MyNameIsRasus> @jorniev he still sends you to Brazil
[2:26:38] <+alphonseisbest> why does this look better then POE2?
[2:26:44] <slatersev> @alphonseisbest Yes
[2:26:50] <%RetroCop87> LET'S TALK ABOUT MURDER
[2:26:57] <+aslfrasle> Hey kids, who wants to talk about murder!
[2:26:57] <slatersev> Arthas is based on a Battle Chasers character
[2:27:00] <slatersev> like
[2:27:04] <slatersev> they stole his design
[2:27:09] <jorniev> WOW
[2:27:11] <+alphonseisbest> Lenny go find Carl
[2:27:36] <jorniev> le bus reing of terror is over
[2:27:57] <jorniev> damn you auto correct ruining my jokes
[2:28:04] <%Dakuu75> So... correct me if i'm wrong but, there's no law or police in bilgwater. you just have vigilantes like Kalista that will merc your shit
[2:28:39] <dan_g_v> so how's the game so far?
[2:28:48] <jorniev> just like the pirate island
[2:29:03] <dan_g_v> nice
[2:29:21] <+alphonseisbest> Chat when Riot was in deep with the SH lawsuits did anything come out about the founders or CEO taking part like at Blizzard?
[2:29:21] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:29:22] <Sydin18> for a LoL game, it sure is lacking Doran's rings ;v
[2:29:30] <TheoTTree> The only 'law' I guess is the enforcers of the pirate factions and stuff present
[2:29:34] <%HairballCT> fishing minigame let's go
[2:29:39] <+aslfrasle> What's the window for some of these fish?
[2:29:41] <%Dakuu75> she should jsut grab the fish with her E
[2:29:42] <akitanito> oh boy
[2:29:43] <TheoTTree> And yes getting your head ripped off by Pyke or something
[2:29:46] <+ALazo> oh no a fishing minigame
[2:29:50] <+aslfrasle> Is it almost time for a Ruby Dragon window?
[2:29:56] <ape_hawk> WAIT FISHING??
[2:29:57] <TheoTTree> Of COURSE we have a fishing minigame
[2:29:59] <TheoTTree> LUL
[2:30:03] <+pectusumbra> this game seems nice, but not a rush pick up in my book at least. Can sit on the wishlist for a bit
[2:30:14] <+pectusumbra> For now I need to get cleaned up and get some sleep. good night!
[2:30:22] <+ALazo> fishing stream
[2:30:31] <%Glass_Muffin> @PatStaresAt How is the art style in the game? It looks pretty neat from what I have seen
[2:30:34] <akitanito> why don't you just use the tentacles to fish everything for you
[2:30:35] <+ALazo> for the rest of the night
[2:30:39] <+CptCreampuff16> for a 30bucks game its pretty fun
[2:30:45] <%NopeBadguy> how's your smtv playthrough going?
[2:30:51] <+emperri> gonna skrt and hit that fish like wiz khalifa
[2:30:52] <+tempestzephyr> So has Pat watched Arcane?
[2:30:52] <%Dakuu75> (it's so weird seeing Illaoi doing this.) lol
[2:30:57] <%NopeBadguy> you're fed
[2:30:58] <%NopeBadguy> on fish
[2:31:09] <%Dakuu75> how the fuck does she real it in with ONE HAND
[2:31:16] <+Bob_Tom> i jdut tuned in, what kind of game is this? rpg? adventure?
[2:31:24] <Sydin18> Have you seen her muscles brah?
[2:31:25] <+Bob_Tom> @Dakuu75 illaoi is stronk
[2:31:26] <mike2hands> Yeaaah they keep this mechanic from battlechasers!!!
[2:31:32] <%chiazam> Yo this game has a fishing mini game!? 10/10
[2:31:33] <MonsieurHedge> any video game that doesnt have a fishing minigame is shit garbage that doesnt deserve to exist
[2:31:34] <%Dakuu75> XD
[2:31:34] <+alphonseisbest> @Dakuu75 she's just that THICC
[2:31:38] <+Thyzoon> Yo this game has fishing? I'm sold.
[2:31:46] <%chiazam> All we need to do is be able to pet the poro
[2:31:49] <%sleeplessmetro> Omg it’s the same mini game from Battle Chasers
[2:31:55] <%MugenSandan> @dakuu75 obviously Braum is friends with the hook and it desperately wishes to return to his side
[2:32:01] <bakkatohri> Can you catch Fizz??? Can you gut him?
[2:32:08] <%Dakuu75> Illaoi Sega Bass Fishing~
[2:32:13] <+emperri> that treasure chest had fins and moved
[2:32:17] <+ALazo> the treasure chest was inside the fish
[2:32:17] <sirrice77> I never finished battlechasers
[2:32:24] <ovan20> the chest was swiming to save his life? o_0
[2:32:37] <vestibus> you can enchant with it in the menu
[2:32:40] <akitanito> it's a mimic
[2:32:47] <noddy182> It was a really big fish, it swallowed a whole chest
[2:33:00] <%Ninestempest> Ninestempest subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 50 months, currently on a 50 month streak! 
[2:33:10] <+emperri> you cannot get ye flask
[2:33:14] <%chiazam> Good things come to those who fish
[2:33:25] <ape_hawk> xplay is back and their first review is of cod:vanguard
[2:33:32] <%Ninestempest> time to watch wha5tever this game is
[2:33:48] <akitanito> moving is a little too slow for my taste
[2:34:13] <%YakumoYomi> YakumoYomi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 20 month streak! ATTENTION, BAJORAN WORKERS: Is Thresh cringe?
[2:34:15] <+Thyzoon> Not to mention the setting is cool too, love the lore of Bilgewater.
[2:34:18] <%Wallabri> how's the story thus far? i know nothing of the Runeterra/LoL universe but this look neat
[2:34:27] <SrHassan> @akitanito i think you can sprint
[2:34:29] <jorniev> now i don't have to get anywhere near that lol game
[2:34:37] <%strakillias> the first area of divinity one is so chill compared to 2
[2:34:44] <%chiazam> I want to see what the game looks like when it really AMPS up
[2:34:45] <SrHassan> SeemsGood
[2:35:00] <+emperri> toggle sprint Kreygasm
[2:35:07] <akitanito> oh that's better
[2:35:10] <Dova573> I hope we get to Yasuo
[2:35:41] <+emperri> fuck everyone named alex
[2:36:16] <ape_hawk> Howlong to beat says 20 hours
[2:36:17] <MrDrayko> its medium
[2:36:20] <%Dakuu75> I assume this is a "part one" thing
[2:36:22] <+alphonseisbest> 20HOURS ON HLTB
[2:36:23] <MonsieurHedge> 30-50hr iirc
[2:36:23] <%NopeBadguy> how long to beat says 20 hours
[2:36:25] <Crouton18> 8hrs0+

[2:37:17] <%Dakuu75> are these guys actually fucking trying to hussle Illaoie...
[2:37:27] <+Jack8274> It launched in 2004

[2:37:36] <Zalthia> BRAUM I LOVE YOU T_T
[2:37:38] <$realm_forge> Ignore the cold skeletal hand of Time in your shoulder pat
[2:37:43] <artoflec> what was the first thing you guys played on XBLA
[2:37:44] <+polothegreatest> No more xbx Bc games PoroSad
[2:37:51] <ape_hawk> why is pat fighting daxter??
[2:38:01] <%chiazam> Whoooo
[2:38:05] <artoflec> i remember being hyped for Dust an Elysian Tale because the animations were so dank
[2:38:22] <+emperri> two time champ of tentacles
[2:38:39] <+alphonseisbest> @artoflec I wnna say wipeout
[2:38:40] <ape_hawk> this yordle fuck is immortal and yet he chooses to be an elevator bandit
[2:38:46] <vestibus> 12
[2:38:49] <p3niletrauma> I know it's the same creators, but this is literally the EXACT same thing as Battlechasers, even down to the color scheme.
[2:38:51] <+CptCreampuff16> 12 to stun
[2:38:52] <MyNameIsRasus> @ape_hawk he wants his franchise back
[2:38:54] <SaltyAzteca> BEEF
[2:39:04] <TheSaltminer> you have to Speed Lane the yordle
[2:39:05] <vestibus> but you  can lower it with talents
[2:39:09] <%notsoy> time 2 reed buffz
[2:39:10] <KingSpunf> Yooo, Battle Chasers Nightwar!
[2:39:14] <artoflec> @alphonseisbest i didnt know that was an XBLA thing tbh, i thought wipeout was traditionally sony
[2:39:28] <+CptCreampuff16> im playing this on herioc and man these fights take a lot of planning i love it
[2:39:31] <TheSaltminer> or just do that
[2:39:34] <Zalthia> pooorooooo
[2:39:44] <+Double_Tap_That> Man, all I can hear whenever Braum talks is Boris yelling "Yes! Yes! Split it wide open!"
[2:39:53] <vestibus> missed the elevator
[2:39:57] <+CptCreampuff16> thats how naut died
[2:40:04] <%Dakuu75> Ruby Tithe?
[2:40:08] <vestibus> Kappa sure
[2:40:21] <p3niletrauma> Like, it's very weird that they were okay with their MOBA IP being used to create a game that has zero unique identity visually and literally looks the exact same as a franchise that's already been established by the developers
[2:40:34] <%NopeBadguy> me braum
[2:40:44] <%ThirdWelles> "*I* don't sweep floors in RPGs because *I'M* a psychopath"
[2:41:13] <ShaggyHighlander> I mean to be fair, LoL and nightwar share a lot of similarities visually as it is
[2:41:40] <slatersev> Yeah because LOL artstyle already takes from Joe Mad
[2:41:42] <robobeau> is this just Diablo 3 but League?
[2:41:48] <%DedlokPM> @p3niletrauma I mean, that Franchise wasn't established by them. It was established by Joe Madueria in the Late 90s/early 2000s
[2:41:49] <+alphonseisbest> @artoflec Oh no, their was an XBLA "version" of a UK based tv game called Wipeout
[2:41:55] <%Wallabri> psaWink
[2:42:04] <vestibus> <3
[2:42:05] <%cade_calrayn> emlo
[2:42:05] <p3niletrauma> Lol I'm aware of the comics
[2:42:13] <%cade_calrayn> praise the kitteh
[2:42:14] <artoflec> @alphonseisbest LOL oh THAT wipeout, that makes more sense
[2:42:17] <%Dakuu75> oh shit, I remember that league game. when we would summon those kinds of minions to run down lane. that was fun and it never came back
[2:42:18] <+tempestzephyr> he is Glowing sipsipHellmo
[2:42:18] <slatersev> and Ruined king already has a higher concurrent peak the Battle Chaser NW
[2:42:22] <+alphonseisbest> @p3niletrauma is it, its working so I'd say its a good/smart move tbh
[2:42:30] <slatersev> There not worried about people associating the two
[2:42:32] <%NopeBadguy> elmo is looking at you yell at fluffy like "are you talking to me"
[2:42:32] <slatersev> also
[2:42:33] <+cubbywolf> fluffy boi alert
[2:42:36] <%NopeBadguy> please pet him
[2:42:38] <slatersev> its a nice artstyle
[2:42:38] <%NopeBadguy> he's a good boi
[2:42:49] <+cubbywolf> give him kissews
[2:42:51] <%NopeBadguy> he's a babby
[2:42:56] <%HairballCT> specifically we got sauerkraut
[2:43:00] <+cubbywolf> an old baby
[2:43:02] <+tempestzephyr> sipsipElmo
[2:43:09] <+polothegreatest> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[2:43:13] <p3niletrauma> Well, I mean, Metroid Dread was just a reskin of 2014's Strider, so I guess this is the new way with games, copy and pasting different franchises onto preexsting games
[2:43:13] <%NopeBadguy> fuck this game, it's an elmo stream now
[2:43:21] <%Ne1son> ELMO
[2:43:33] <+Ulf1863> elmy
[2:43:33] <p3niletrauma> Granted, it's still so pretty
[2:43:35] <MyNameIsRasus> i have a friend who has like 7 cats. i can't imagine the amount of cat hair.
[2:43:37] <MelBrooksKA> Pat, you are the zoo
[2:43:42] <TheSaltminer> What, you don't like Fermented Cabbage? Don't be so sauer, kraut!"
[2:43:45] <+FattimusSlime> PET THE ELMO
[2:43:46] <stevenellis386> pet your cat
[2:43:47] <Buttku> is living in a zoo a bad thing?
[2:43:56] <%DedlokPM> And it's not exactly the first time that a big IP holder has done such a thing. Like, another recent example: Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl @p3niletrauma
[2:43:56] <akitanito> fight barrry
[2:44:00] <+alphonseisbest> Chat, if a game is popular on STEAM, would u say theirs a good chance its also popular on the consoles?
[2:44:04] <+polothegreatest> forget hair, ghe food per month NotLikeThis
[2:44:09] <KingSpunf> The only thing I know about LoL is that there are purple shortstacks. Is that going to help me understand the story?
[2:44:13] <%RetroCop87> IT'S A SYMBOL OF A FISH
[2:44:23] <%DedlokPM> They hired a dev that made their own Smash Clone, Slap City, to make their own Smash Clone
[2:44:31] <%Dakuu75> yeah Barry, lift weights and get swoll then go for revenge after like 5 months
[2:44:37] <+alphonseisbest> hmm fair
[2:44:54] <%NopeBadguy> one could say
[2:44:56] <%NopeBadguy> it's a
[2:44:58] <%NopeBadguy> league of legends
[2:45:00] <p3niletrauma> @DedlokPM Very fair. I guess it's just a further layer of laziness the game industry is adopting, now that it seems to be working.
[2:45:02] <TheoTTree> Legends. 🤔
[2:45:04] <+alphonseisbest> @DedlokPM man that game's story is so sad, its like DEAD after less then a month?
[2:45:06] <%ThirdWelles> Does it have a league?
[2:45:07] <%NopeBadguy> 4Head
[2:45:08] <mortificent> I feel like I wanna get crushed in between those two
[2:45:10] <Zalthia> @NopeBadguy get out
[2:45:11] <jorniev> FRENS
[2:45:11] <vestibus> the league isn't Canon reee
[2:45:21] <%RetroCop87> "mAYBE... YOU COULD FORM SOME SORT OF league WITH THOSE legends"
[2:45:38] <%Dakuu75> it's not
[2:45:39] <Dova573> WHO CARES
[2:45:39] <TheoTTree> It is not yeah
[2:45:40] <+notgoodatnamessorry> le
[2:45:43] <slatersev> The league of legends game isnt canon
[2:45:43] <%MidnightBurst12> @NopeBadguy stop that
[2:45:43] <+polothegreatest> old league lol is non canon anymore
[2:45:45] <jorniev> i would like to tell you about the league of legends initiative
[2:45:45] <MyNameIsRasus> league of legends isn't canon ANYMORE
[2:45:45] <Zalthia> It isn't
[2:45:46] <slatersev> lmao
[2:45:46] <+happyfaceman> so I have no knowledge or context of this game, nor have I even touched League of Legends. Is this just a League Diablo?
[2:45:50] <+alphonseisbest> @DedlokPM dude, why work harder, when u can work SMARTER LUL
[2:45:51] <%zolvagion> Not anymore it isn't
[2:45:53] <+alphonseisbest> TRUE
[2:45:54] <TheoTTree> It used to be, not any more. Because the old lore was REALLY hard to write around
[2:45:54] <%MugenSandan> it used to be BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[2:45:54] <+Ophill> todays been a fun twitter day...
[2:45:56] <%Ynkubus_> The old League lore was tossed and then nothing happned for a long time
[2:45:57] <+notgoodatnamessorry> the canon of league has been determined 3 times
[2:45:58] <vestibus> people have misunderstood some comments from devs about Canon stuff and are made for no reason
[2:45:59] <+CptCreampuff16> at this point nothing is cannon in league
[2:45:59] <+octoculi> You're not even wrong in a way.
[2:46:04] <mortificent> @happyfaceman League Battle Chasers
[2:46:06] <%zolvagion> RIP old League lore
[2:46:08] <slatersev> they put out a tweet today expliclty saying this game is canon and where it is on the timeline
[2:46:08] <+ghostfaceninja_> Steve Buscemi looks on with dissatisfaction, he knows that Pat and Paige are not the main attraction...
[2:46:09] <+tempestzephyr> they apparently retcon things a lot
[2:46:14] <+alphonseisbest> @happyfaceman no, its LOL POE2
[2:46:15] <viewtifulr> pfft league lore
[2:46:16] <%DedlokPM> @DedlokPM I can assure you that this extends to a lot further than just recently. Pretty much the entirety of the existence of the video game industry has had similar things.
[2:46:18] <mike2hands> They just link some things with each other
[2:46:19] <anAngryHamster> Curiously attractive for a fish man
[2:46:25] <jorniev> WAIT WHAT REALLY IT ISN'T CANON!? WHAT YHE HELL IS WITH ITS LORE!?
[2:46:26] <%RetroCop87> does DOTA have a canon? Aside from the sexual assault stuff, I mean?
[2:46:28] <+notgoodatnamessorry> the canon of league has been retconned like twice
[2:46:28] <vestibus> they retcon OLD stuff.
[2:46:30] <+polothegreatest> from wizard pupperteering people to multiverse for unlimited skins
[2:46:30] <+happyfaceman> @happyfaceman is this done by the Battle Chasers team? I love Battle Chasers
[2:46:38] <vestibus> this game is canon
[2:46:50] <Zalthia> @jorniev TBSkyen has a video essay on it if you want the long version
[2:47:04] <MyNameIsRasus> i sure hope this game is canon because it's either this or sentinels of light
[2:47:05] <+alphonseisbest> @happyfaceman yes
[2:47:07] <1matheuw> they also said that each version of the ruination is canon to itself only
[2:47:08] <%DedlokPM> @happyfaceman yes. this is made by the Battle Chasers/Darksiders devs
[2:47:11] <%Dakuu75> remember when it was a bunch of wizards in purple robs that just mind-controlled the legends? lol
[2:47:11] <MyNameIsRasus> and sentinels sucked massive peepee
[2:47:14] <+happyfaceman> oh shit
[2:47:15] <p3niletrauma> It's the same team. I strongly feel this was originally designed as Battlechasers 2, but then sold to Riot and adopted to their IP
[2:47:15] <+happyfaceman> awesome
[2:47:17] <+alphonseisbest> @RetroCop87 wat DOTA HAD SA STUFF????
[2:47:17] <+Manooz> yo Joe mad's art is fucking sick thats why
[2:47:26] <%NopeBadguy> hey pat i just wanna say i'm super stoked you're continuing unmetal tomorrow, i thought it was gonna be a one-off for sure
[2:47:35] <vestibus> but no people overblow the retcons. it's all old stuff that was written like 8 years ago that had a good reason to be retconned
[2:47:35] <1matheuw> in other terms there are 4 or 5 canons of this event in particular
[2:47:59] <GeoGio3> are you having any goblins with this game?
[2:48:10] <Zalthia> @jorniev The short version is that when LoL started, the "lore" was just an excuse to have a bunch of weirdos try to kill each otehr every game. Then they decided they wanted an actual universe out of that and retconned a lot of shit. Every few years they do an overhaul and more stuff gets rewritten, or just straight up removed.
[2:48:10] <slatersev> Ruined King is the prequel to Ruination anyway
[2:48:18] <slatersev> so it doesnt fall into that cluster fuck anyway
[2:48:43] <%DedlokPM> @p3niletrauma yeah no. Things don't work like that at all. More likely Riot approached them and went like "Hey, we liked what you did with Battle Chasers. We'll give you money to do the same with our IP."
[2:48:51] <%chiazam> No city is safe from SLUMS
[2:48:53] <False_Being> psaCrazyhand
[2:48:55] <%ChrisPlaysThing> THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOBLIN, PAT
[2:48:56] <%Paperware> @vestibus Yeah the old stuff made it hard to make new champion lore because plot lines started to repeat themselves real often
[2:49:37] <Zalthia> I think It was more the suddenness of it. People got attatched to characters whose main motivation was suddenly gone, and the backstories weren't updated. No one had any idea where any character really stood anymore.
[2:49:38] <1matheuw> the old lore was just a bunch of lines that lead to nowhere
[2:49:51] <+polothegreatest> yet they still made SONA2
[2:50:05] <1matheuw> yea they murked the old lore and then did nothing for years
[2:50:07] <MyNameIsRasus> BRAUM AGIOTA LESS GO
[2:50:10] <Meekest> Yay loan sharking
[2:50:13] <p3niletrauma> There's countless games that began development as one thing, were purchased out/ran out of money and bailed and forced/allowed to become others. I mean, all the way back to Gothic 1 lol
[2:50:15] <%notsoy> Braum is certainly shakedown-sized
[2:50:21] <MrDrayko> Illaoi and Braum are totally Mr. Shakedown contenders
[2:50:21] <p3niletrauma> Things deffo work that way at times
[2:50:26] <%ThirdWelles> ill-ow-ee
[2:50:33] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Murder. Death. Kill. Murder. Death. Kill.
[2:50:38] <1matheuw> maybe hurt them a little
[2:50:40] <vestibus> Braum would never hurt anybody for money
[2:50:43] <Zalthia> Like, Kayle was an angel from another dimension who was summoned to runeterra by the guys who ran the League. Then when the in-universe league was gone, it's like... what is she? Why is she here?
[2:50:48] <%notsoy> MAIM KILL BURN MAIM KILL BURN
[2:50:48] <vestibus> that's non canon
[2:50:58] <%Dakuu75> ...
[2:51:05] <+alphonseisbest> Braum wouldn't hurt a fly
[2:51:07] <+bluestbee> Braum is Nice
[2:51:11] <Zalthia> And then multiply that by every champion that wasn't allied with a city-state or nation.
[2:51:14] <+ghostfaceninja_> maybe don't become a mobster Pat...
[2:51:15] <%RetroCop87> Good luck earning that interest with that busted leg
[2:51:15] <p3niletrauma> Granted, it could also be that Riot wanted the same art style and approached them as well. It's all speculation.
[2:51:18] <+polothegreatest> avatars was a good move imo
[2:51:19] <vestibus> lol old league lore sucks qss
[2:51:21] <jorniev> what the hell is the league of legends?
[2:51:22] <1matheuw> illaoi on the other hand...
[2:51:34] <vestibus> old kayle lore sucked nobody cared
[2:51:34] <slatersev> Remember the reddit post talking about every champions backstory before the retcon? And it was literally for everyone "They have a mysterious past"
[2:51:38] <slatersev> Expect Draven
[2:51:42] <slatersev> whos just liked killing
[2:51:47] <Zalthia> O,
[2:51:54] <+alphonseisbest> @Zalthia is tha stiill the current state?
[2:52:07] <vestibus> oh and Nidalee was dating a guy from Riot
[2:52:09] <Zalthia> @alphonseisbest Nah, now she's like
[2:52:20] <vestibus> Or rather an OC of a rioter lmao
[2:52:28] <jorniev> all i remember is more kaiser and the spining dude, oh and Teemo... fuck Teemo
[2:52:31] <Zalthia> @alphonseisbest Part of a Targon god or something?
[2:52:44] <ovan20> D: babies acting like babies is normal.
[2:52:49] <vestibus> her mother was a targon god
[2:52:54] <1matheuw> yeah draven was and still is just an attention seeking psycopath
[2:52:57] <%Ne1son> Teemo is great
[2:53:11] <+alphonseisbest> @Zalthia IDK what that is. but it sounds cool
[2:53:12] <%MelBrooksKA> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaGib
[2:53:20] <Zalthia> @vestibus Yeah, it wasn't GOOD. a LOT of it was pretty bad. But at the time, it was moving? And then it just stopped. And They were like "Yeah none of that happened" so no one knew WHAT to think.

[2:54:13] <Zalthia> @alphonseisbest avatars of a concept as gods. There's an aspect of mischief, an aspect of war, an aspect of the sun and moon, etc. I believe Kayle is related to the aspect of Justice.
[2:54:23] <+TurnipKupo> I hope I can be as great an actor one day

[2:54:53] <GarbageNirvana> You thought I was asleep, didn't you? Acting!
[2:55:00] <vestibus> you can lower it and her tentacles and dots stack it as well
[2:55:00] <TheSaltminer> 12 stacks, but you can lower that number with upgrades
[2:55:03] <+emperri> I think it's 4 in league
[2:55:05] <1matheuw> also aspects can die and another aspect can ascend and take their domain
[2:55:18] <TheSaltminer> each of Illaoi's tentacles is one stack
[2:55:19] <p3niletrauma> I'd rather watch Pat impersonate Zangief for 3 hours than watch Joker even once
[2:55:29] <GarbageNirvana> I mean they chose violence, not you
[2:55:40] <KingSpunf> ...I think I know why my gay friend is into League despite not playing it
[2:55:53] <akitanito> well why don't you?
